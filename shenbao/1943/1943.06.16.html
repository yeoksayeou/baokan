<p>社評</p>
<h3>新風氣與戰時衣服問題</h3>
<p>「昨論述樹立新風氣，我們提出節約實踐週的建議，希望各界注意七項實踐節約的具體條件，其中已有一項，「不御華服，不購高貴衣料」。我們這種建議，似乎是老生常談，但是在樹立新風氣運動中，却有其重要的意義。衣服問題，是民生問題中第一項，古人所說「衣食足而後知榮暴」，與民食問題同樣重視。尤其是在今日，在戰爭時期，衣服問題，實際上比糧食問題有過之無不及。因爲戰時糧食問題之發生，不是在於需要之增加，只在於生產力之降低，可是，衣料方面，除了生產力方面，與糧介同樣日趨降落之外，尚有需要增加的問題，因爲，衣服的主要原料是棉花，而棉花同時正是重要的軍火原料；爲了戰爭的需要，勢不能不以平常供給衣料的原料之一部分留作軍需原料；同時，在棉紗布方面，也由於戰爭關係及戰時的損失與消耗，如軍隊所需被服之增加，傷病兵員醫藥用棉紗布消耗之增大等等。因此，在組織健全的國家，在戰爭時期，對於衣料，必須與糧食同樣重視，實施嚴格的生產與消費統制，要求國民普遍和切實的節約。</p>
<p>從國防的觀點來談戰時衣服問題，既有上述重大的意義；再從政治的與社會經濟的觀點而言，衣服是「所以章身」的，用現代的話來說，它除了保持體溫保護人身健康之外，還有其表現服用者之身分的意義，因此，歷朝帝王，對於官民衣服，各依品級，分別其形式，體制與色素，不得僭越，充分表現封建政治的特色。在政治上暴露階級的意義，在社會上也造成勢利的觀念，致俗有「只奉衣衫不奉人」之諺，在這種制度與觀念之下，不逞之徒，就有私造龍袍御衣的事件，無知鄉愚，則不惜行賄以洗白衣人之「恥」，歷代民族風氣之敗壞，未嘗不與此有關。民國以來，服制之禁雖弛，而變相的衣服之惡習代之而起，即人人鄙視本國固有服制，務求新頴，以期驚世駭俗而自崇其不凡之地位。試觀二三十年來男女衣飾之演變，直可謂盡過去數千年間未有之變態，而奇裝異服之製造，由原料以至縫工，莫不假手於歐美人；究其實際，則唯極奢侈浪費爲美麗，究其用心，則以洋服自高其身分，所以，不僅在經濟上造成國民經濟一大漏巵，而在社會風氣上助長奢糜的習慣。</p>
<p>日本於本月四日閣議，曾決定：「戰時衣生活簡素化實施要綱」，就是針對目前戰爭的局勢，在纖維產業部門爲要整備大規模的企業，改變其生產情况，因此對於國民大衆的衣服的消費，不得不實行規則化，以形成全體性的決戰生活體制。日本所決定的「衣生活簡素化要綱」，其要點就在於衣料資材之節减，以期全國人民平均分配，並以大部移用於更有意義的部門。爲了實行「簡素化」，日本國民已經盛行國民服與標準服，普遍澈底地消除華美奢侈的風習。對於各公務機關，各公用團體，各公司的職員，更一律穿御制服，一掃華美虛榮而實踐戰時「衣生活」。我們認爲中國今日實在也有由國家規定節衣政策及在民間普遍推行節衣運動的必要。</p>
<p>我們提倡節衣運動的方針，是實踐戰時國民生活，是爲了改善社會風氣，同時，就是節約有用的人力物資，以提供於戰爭。但是，我們所要倡導的節衣運動，有下列幾個重要的前提，即（一）必須是合乎國情的，現在我國除了少數暴發戶與特殊階級的富豪以外，大多數人正陷於食且不足遑言衣服的窘境，因此，一方面固須嚴禁華服及奇裝，另一方面則須使一般人都有衣穿，以期做到公平利民四字。譬如單純的提出禁穿西裝等口號，即爲我們所不取，因爲有一部份人士，還靠着幾件舊西裝章身，一言禁止，反有無錢製備國民服或標準服之苦。（二）必須是適合時代的，我們決不能在這時提倡恢復古裝，人人寬袍博帶，也決不能一味拘泥於本國舊有的服制，人人藍袍黑褂或規定男則長衫女必衣裙；同時，更決不能重見衣服的階級限制，除了軍警或特定的官吏如法官等在職務上有識別之必要者外，我們要反對穿衣的階級觀念。這一點尤盼社會各界領袖以身作則，如穿簡。便衣服等即是。（三）必須是適合實際需要與工作便利的原則，要使衣服能夠適合保健，便捷，並足以提高服用者積極與自導的精神，例如公務人員及敎育，文化，自由職業者等，可服用中山裝，各工廠男女工作人員，店員學徒，就可在「勞工神聖」的意和下服用工裝，至於婦女服裝，與其規定型式，不如限制質料之爲宜，但求不奢華不浪費物資就好了。</p>
<p>我們更希望社會各界領袖以身作則，倡導節衣，轉移社會以衣衫視人的惡習，恢復先聖布衣芒履以風化天下的美德。記得廣西在事變以前一度有全國模範省之稱，政治社會備受各界讚揚，當時上層份子之灰布衣運動，實爲　造風氣的轉捩點。東南不乏志士，似宜協力倡導以蔚成東亞新民風，那就不只是國家在參戰中一時之利了。</p>

<h3>石渡顧問　在粵談經濟問題</h3>
<p>廣州十五日中央社電</p>
<p>國府經濟顧問石渡莊太郎氏，於日前抵此後，十五日招待記者團發表談話，說明國府財政狀况，及華南經濟之將來，大意謂，國府財政並不依靠公債及借款，而僅以稅收策劃，故實可謂爲健全之財政，惟根本問題，在如何引導滬地游資，至生產方面，此在中國財界方面，已進行準備工作，蓋戰時下物資之不足，物價之高漲，及通貨膨脹，雖爲不可避免之現象，惟盡量努力滅少其影響，實爲重要，對華南經濟之現狀及其將來，殊爲樂觀，良以華南情形與華中迥異，即物價並無多大之上漲，現全國商業統制總會，有在廣州成立分會之必要，此事在中日雙方未進行磋商以前，日方亟應尊重中國方面之自重性，又物價之高漲，固爲奸商囤積居奇所致，但生　减少，亦爲一重要原因，故余認爲現在振興工業，在華南亦與華中同感重要。</p>

<p>一望無際的麥田，雨後的道路，在麥田裏隱約可見。我們一行搭乘軍用郵政卡車，穿越麥田中間，一路開行。輸轉之聲軋軋，一隻在路傍覓食的雉，吃驚而飛到了田裏，雨後的夕陽，把殘雲染得通紅、大陸現在是將近莊嚴的黃昏時分了。東一偭，西一個的農夫，遠看好像浮木飄在水上，有的赶牛，有的推小車子，三五成羣，急急歸家、農夫們雖然辛勤了一天，臉上都毫無疲勞之色。</p>
<p>「一片和平景象哪！」生長在鄉村的那位朋友，自言自語的這樣說着。從江南渡長江，而從扛北的揚州到泰縣，這一條途上，我也覺得是一派和平景象。江北的麥好像比江南更熟，葬在田裏的無數墳墓，也顯得是和平的象徵。</p>
<p>表面上，蘇北是這樣的和平。後來聽人說從揚州到泰縣這一條路上，或許有匪賊出現亦未可知。</p>
<p>但是在泰縣勾留二週，聽各方面的說法，又作寶際的見聞調査，囘來的時候在卡車上想想，大不相同，歸來時麥田中正忙得割麥，看那農夫的雙手一起一伏，似已忙得很辛苦，然而這是他們的本份，自己種植，自已割取的收薐物、結果並不是他們自己的，而是業主的東西，留在他們手頭的，不過剛夠生活的一些，或許是不夠充足，生活的收獲物。隔絕鄉間在都市裏渡奢華生活的業主們，祗要給這些農民們一點最底限度的生活保證，他們也會滿足的了。雖有無情的天災人禍，可是蘇北還有可以養活一千二百萬人口的收穫，蘇北的財政，頗能收支相抵，那末生產者的農民，爲何還要受塗炭之苦呢？其原因何在？這就是他們縱有增加生產的意志，然而沒有先決間題的資金，增產必須改良，改良就含有危險性，所以業主一味保守，現在銀行又不喜歡農業資本放款，原因是農民沒有借款的抵押品，如果要將我所見他們的苦衷從頭細說，眞是一言難盡。</p>
<p>蘇北農業的改革，有關整個中國農業。這裏單就蘇北農業來講吧！第一，有一個關於和平區的治安問題。其次，有一個封建的或保守的經濟組織自身的問題。離開這些政治上，經濟上條件就農業自身的改革言，有下列五點：（一）治水，（二）利水，（三）肥料，（四）種子，（五）農具。關於一，二兩點，姑且從略，關於第三點，目下在蘇北所用的肥料，針有豆餅，下肥，河泥等，其實還有許多地方，圖該用化學肥料。蘇北的土地，並不若吾人想像之沃肥，至於種子問題，更有必要亦未可知，就拿稻來舉一個例，在蘇北平均一丘三包，而日本五洲北部，一丘可收九包左右。據南通某農事研究所的實騐結果，士佐一號種與蘇北的稻用一樣的法子來種，結果士佐一號種增加了三成收穫。可是他們農民怕改良有危險，依然存保守思想，所以今後必須打破此種墨守陳法的習慣。至論農具問題，可以舉出耕作用農具，收穫用農具，灌溉用農具三種，他們對上面三種農具，還是用最原始的方法來做，例如鍬因爲不是鐵製而多爲木鍬，所以不能　耕，不能深耕是增產的致命傷。（雲鵬：譯自六月十四日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>歐洲局勢愈趨緊迫　立體決戰即將展開　德方已完成全部海岸防禦　兩大陣營間正爭奪制空權</h3>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　歐洲戰局之重心，已由地上戰鬥轉至空中決戰之階段，如東部戰綫德·蘇兩軍爲爭奪制空權，已展開浴血之大空戰，西部戰綫德·英雙方亦正展開互攻本土之空襲戰。此外，地中海戰綫亦因攻　海·空軍根據地，連日展開決死之空戰。衆認軸心與反軸心兩陣營間一賭存亡之海·陸·空立體大決戰必將勃發。因比，歐洲戰局之歸邊，已極爲緊迫，試就目前歐洲戰局由地中海戰綫與東綫兩者之關聯性而觀，即可想見今後歐洲戰局之動向必將有如下之歸趨。蓋自反軸心軍獲得潘特拉雷亞及蘭貝杜薩兩　後，即傳已使之成爲重要根據地，但如今日之情况，仍絕不能認爲即可以此實行對歐洲大陸中心部之登陸作戰，其理由約有下述數端：（一）軸心軍自於五月上旬完成大西洋之防禦障壁後，則北起椰威北端，南迄比斯開灣，已無反軸心軍可乘隙攻入之處，且在地中海岸一帶，軸心方面亦正積極加强防衛力量，尤其在南法海岸等處陳綫更堅固異常，而完全要塞化。（二）反軸心軍欲實現進攻歐洲作戰，需預備大量之兵員·武器·輜重及無數之船舶，但其即欲確保最低限度之數目，亦尙須相當时日。（三）前於華盛頓會談之時，反軸心陣營之全面戰略，因受美國輿論之重壓，終分解爲二，大體之計劃爲美國食責担當太平洋方面之作戰，英國担常歌洲方面之作戰，因之，反軸心軍對歐洲戰綫之攻勢，已相當挫减。（四）反軸心軍爲欲實現進攻歐洲作戰，則同時蘇聯必須在東錢發動大攻勢，然目前蘇軍尚未準備完成作戰時應有之戰力，根據以上四點，可知反軸心陣營今後惟有暫時一則須由政治與軍事兩方面對西班牙。土耳其等中立國施以壓力，故目下亦正不斷策動各該中立國，以便利用，但軸心陣營對此已籌謀萬全對策。兵力亦巳移調完畢，其稍有問題者，即反軸心空軍對德本土尤以魯爾地區之轟炸，但德軍亦將取轟炸之手段以爲報復。同時，對此亦正積極進行具體之對策，故反軸心空軍轟炸之效果已顯著減低，且不久即將消滅。總之，軸心方面已將歐洲全部海岸完全築成鐵壁之要塞，似正靜待反軸心軍發動進攻作戰後，即展開大殲滅戰，然與此戰綫有重大關聯者，即東部戰綫演變。按東綫德·蘇兩軍刻僅從事爲爭奪制空權而展開之空中決戰，蘇聯報道機關雖大事宣傳，蘇軍已掌握制空權，但如觀德元首行營發表之公報，則除平均一日擊毀蘇機百架至百五十架外，並會於前八日內，連續大炸蘇聯高爾基·窩爾霍夫及亞羅斯拉夫等各要衝，由此可見德空軍於該方面已獲絕對之優勢。據最近自莫斯科返國之英標準晚報特派記者布蘭德所作之報吿謂，蘇軍之動員能力已無餘裕，是爲今後作戰上之失敗點，且亦可謂已處於兵力消耗後，難於補充之狀態，故預料蘇軍於冬季以前，與其發動攻勢被德軍殲滅，勿寗採取退避戰術，儘量避免其軍隊之消耗，同時設法使德軍戰力減退。然就德軍作戰問題而言，德軍旣攻佔烏克蘭穀倉及其他戰略上必要之地域，則今年夏季，自無發動攻勢之理由，或將發動局部之遭遇戰，以逐次殲滅蘇軍戰力，良以軸心陣營爲將來與反軸心陣營一決雌雄起見，自當以蓄養戰力，參酌地中海戰局，隨機應付，最爲善策。而今軸心已支配歐洲大陸之中心，英·美·蘇三國，已完全被驅出歐州大陸，此與反軸心軍因在東亞及西南太平洋不得侵入日本勢力圈，而憂慮作戰失敗之情形初無二致。「時間」無論在歐洲及東亞，均有利於軸心方面，德軍能於轉瞬之間，不勞神經而獲得良機，反軸心方面則因受「時間」之壓迫，乃惟有坐以待斃而已。</p>
<h3>義法西斯黨　上書墨索里尼　提出九項要求　彈壓陰謀擾亂企圖　根絕不合黨綱交易</h3>
<p>羅馬十五日中央社電</p>
<p>義法西斯黨秘書長斯哥爾茲，十四日曾上書墨索里尼首相，陳述該黨之要求要旨，謂法西斯黨全國幹部會已議決如下之宣言案，蓋幹部會爲澈底抗戰之決定，對政府提出九項要求：（一）對於陰謀擾亂義國國民志氣之一切企圖，必要時公布新法令，斷行彈壓。（二）統一並統制農業生產。（三）加緊整飭及統制一切物資之配給。（四）將各種經濟機構縮至必要之最小限度。（五）撤除官塲之一切冗務。（六）暗市交易與法西斯黨綱絕不相容，故應採取一切手段，予以根絕。（七）嚴厲取締大飯店奢侈之餐廳，製作衣類之商店，以及不合戰爭規律之商店，必要時予以封鎖。（八）對於居住於義國國內之一切外國人，認其無居住之必要者，使其歸國或予以隔離。（九）嚴格且普遍的適用義務服務法令。此外，法西斯黨幹部會更對一切之生產者要求提供其一切生產品於國家機關，國家機關將此等物資予以公正配給。又要求工人及產業主以其最大之能率致力於其任務，要求學生·敎授·產業家及技術者，爲支持武裝兵力之行動，而盡其全力。更要求義國靑年爲其祖國挺身於戰塲，確認義國國民之英雄的傳統精神。就靑年言之，現任唯一必要者，乃法西斯黨主義，墨索里尼主義，爲實踐以上之主義，僅有讀書工作及戰鬥。法西斯黨爲祖國而流血，對衛護其祖國之義國國民，無時不表示最大敬意，希望義國國民，內求一致團結，外謀打倒敵人。法西斯黨所負之使命，不但爲形成國民中心之惟一動力，且負有保衛國民以增强國力及確保祖國運命之究全責任。</p>
<h3>軸心軍放棄　地中海一小島</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電據此間昨晚接獲路透社消息面，反軸心軍已佔領西西里南面之蘭比奧尼小島，該島面積僅〇·〇三方公里，不過係在地中海中突出之一塊大石而已。據路透稱：島上有一燈塔，而據一九四〇年出版之哥達航海歷則謂，該島並無居民。</p>
<p>羅馬十五日中央社電</p>
<p>據海通社特派員宣稱：地中海中之潘特拉里亞島與蘭貝杜薩島，面積極小，旣不能作爲空軍根據地。更無海軍根據地之價值，英國今雖加以佔領，實毫無補助，祇能作爲一種宣傳資料而已。馬爾太島之大小，倍於潘特拉里亞島，哥索島則與潘特拉里亞島之大小相同。早經證明不能作爲良好之空軍根據地。實則上連四島因面積狹小，故其飛行塲經數星期之轟炸即能毀壞殆盡，蘭貝杜薩島更小。飛機起飛與降陸均感不便，潘特拉里亞尚能停留飛機，雖較易遭擊沉之航空母艦爲有利，但亦極　　受空襲之破壞。撤丁島與科西嘉島則並無此種缺點，軍事設備較多，敵機空襲獲逞之機會遂較少，潘特拉里亞島距西西里島僅一百公里，故軸心機隨時可至該處自由活動。</p>
<h3>阿根廷將開閣議　討論内政問題</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城十五日中央社電　海通社訊，阿根廷內閣定星期五開會，屆時將討論內政問題，其中最主要者，將爲生活費之减低。又據昨晚公布，森薩爾瓦多已宣布承認拉米雷茲新政府。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十五日中央社電　參與六月四日革命之阿根廷軍隊，昨已撒離京城返美奧及愛拉之軍營，在開拔前，陸軍部長法來爾將軍曾加檢閱。</p>
<p>阿根廷袁城十五日中央社電　海通社訊，外長史特爾尼海軍少將，昨接見德參贊奧多美納公使。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十五日中央社電　據海通社訊，阿根廷政府已宣布承認羅遜將軍任內閣總理時所頒布解散國會之法令，前任參議員與衆議員均不詳進國會。外交部宣布梵蒂崗，海地及聖馬力諾亦已承認阿根廷新政府。</p>
<h3>西班牙陸軍委會　舉行重要會議</h3>
<p>馬德里十五日中央社電</p>
<p>西最高陸軍委會昨舉行會議，由陸軍部長卡勃納拉將軍主席，會際中曾有極長討論，惟尚無官方文吿發表。據云，負國防使命之考爾脫司委員會，將於六月廿一日在考爾晚司太廈舉行會議。</p>
<h3>東綫各路激戰</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十五日中央社電　據東綫消息，奥萊爾地區德蘇兩軍之攻防戰，已漸擴展至東北方，迄十三日下午，雙方己在茲麥河東岸要衝姆茲安斯克展開激烈之陣地爭奪戰，蘇軍在姆資安斯克地區攻入布爾安斯克，企圖一舉將奧萊爾地區奪回，但經德軍猛烈之反擊，蒙受重挫，故至十四日，該戰綫已無任何變化。又蘇軍於唐納資上遊比尼哥羅特西方地區，亦巳展開大規模攻勢，但似已受德軍重砲之威脅敗退。此外卡科夫東方地區之蘇軍亦正圖渡過　納資河西岸，經德軍予以重創後不支潰退。據德國通訊社訊，庫彭橋頭堡之蘇軍已打開沈默之態度，開始在北面進攻，雙方經長時間之肉搏，終被德軍擊退。</p>
<h3>葡京外交活躍</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電</p>
<p>海通社訊，英大使坎培爾爵士，星期五。六一再訪問葡總理薩拉柴爾，此間政界聞悉，殊覺驚異，而在聞悉第二次會見時美公使斐許亦會參與後，更爲驚詫。另一有趣之消息，如西班牙政府及葡萄牙政府現正經由外交途徑大事交換意見，反軸心國家在地中海加緊軍事活動之際，其在葡京之外交行動，極受注意。</p>
<h3>英前陸相重視　日軍戰力增强</h3>
<p>阿根廷十五日中央社電</p>
<p>英前陸相貝里夏十三日於阿根廷之拉松報發表一文，略謂，東亞反軸心軍戰略上之空軍基地，於戰前即感不足，而今其大部尤其最重要者，已悉入於日軍手中。並謂，判斷太平洋之情勢，首須檢討日軍戰力大形增强之事實，日本之立塲，因獲得多數重要地域，於戰略及經濟方面，均有極大改善，加之日本之船舶噸數增加，故太平洋戰爭將更延長。</p>
<h3>日本海海戰與日特蘭海戰</h3>
<p>— 伊藤正德　（三）</p>
<p>（七）我國追擊與英國躱避</p>
<p>東鄕元帥的雄姿，在翌二十八日上午十時，出現於安心北駛中的俄國艦隊面前時說「這可好了！」，正如獅子見了兔鼠一樣。司令官奈保葛道夫不發一砲而升起白旗，於是尼古拉皇帝對日戰略孤注一擲的最後希望波羅的海艦隊，竟成了歷史上的名詞，而全軍覆沒了。時間爲上午十時三十四分。</p>
<p>這樣可以看到東鄕元帥的追擊，收獲到了百分之百以上的結果。東鄉元帥的追擊究竟是怎樣進行的？五月二十七日下午七時二十分離開戰塲，在暗夜裏繼續不斷地北駛，先行駛到朝鮮最北端離岸一百海里處的鬱時島附近，預先準備好了翌晨敵軍必來的戰塲。元帥直接率領三竺號以下主力艦六艘，出雲號重巡洋艦以下六艘，浪速號輕巡洋艦以下四艘等，命令第三，第五，第六等輕巡洋艦隊搜索敵踪，而元帥親自率領的艦隊從上午五時就升火待啟準備妥當。就在這個時候，敵方殘餘主力戰艦阿里耀號，尼古拉一世號，巡洋艦阿補拉克新號，塞尼耀印號，伊慈穆爾德號等共五艘向前駛來。另外，脫離司令官而逃道的各艦，都被我方各別追上而聚沉，但逃囘海參威者只不過是巡洋艦阿爾馬茲號，驅逐艦二艘（逃入中立國港口而被解除武裝之艦艇有六艘），已於是三十八艘的大艦隊完全殲滅，俄國的勝利信心也於焉終止，日俄戰爭的大局也於此分明。</p>
<p>再囘頭來看看日特蘭海戰。哲利科規避夜戰，而徒然無益地向南駛行八十五海里，六月一日未出太陽前（上午三時），　艦則駛到距離荷恩里隔十二海里遠，而英艦則到三十海里處，，於是德國艦隊悠然自得地進人本國繼雷防區。德艦六艘因爲都是舊戰艦，所以比英艦的連度每小時優三海里。何况英艦都在內綫，所以如果有再戰決意的話，那末可以很容易地急駛至荷恩里福去等待翌晨德艦隊的來臨。英國艦隊應當有一個「日特蘭的　陵島」，應常學習日水海戰時日本艦隊以　陵島爲等待敵軍出現的地點。然而哲利科却自動逃開這一戰塲。而遠離三十海里。這是英國將領不知道怎樣取得勝利的一點。</p>
<p>（八）一則全勝，一則未勝</p>
<p>最後，再談一下更明顯的迥避追擊的事實。讀者也許還記得喜亞提書的囘頭退却戰法。也許還會記得邇避水雷攻擊而何　方轉舵，寛使德　艦隊很容易地　度进出轟擊圈外。我對於這個描寫業已加以評論，但現在又與日本海戰時東鄉元帥所施行的戰術作一比較，爲了更加淸楚，必須再附加一筆。</p>
<p>東鄉元帥用銳利的眼光捕捉着敵方旗艦，努力前進追擊，而逼迫敵軍交緩。日本在陸軍戰術中稱作「　着攻擊」。靠近敵人一面痛加攻擊一面不放鬆的追趕。這是一種不使敵人逃脫的攻法，而東鄉元帥把這種陸軍戰衛實演在海洋土。而哲利科正相反，從傍面和敵交戰，但當敵人逃脫時，却很自然地嘖雲叶霧吸着香烟。假如少微認眞一點，只要拿出東鄕元帥的一手努力或四分之一的努力，　一定可以追趕得上而奏大功。這一點旣然對方喜亞提　率直地承認，當然不會有錯。喜亞說：</p>
<p>「他應當保持他的位置。假如他們在西方一齊轉舵而企圖頑張靠近我們，則我國艦隊一定會在更遠的西方被包圍起來。」</p>
<p>如果英軍眞也這樣行動，則德軍的艱苦戰門程度，不待喜亞自己講出，大家也都可以明白的。喜亞提督對於這一點曾非常地担心。但在六時三十五分，嘗試囘頭退却時，哲利科並不追趕前來。因此有機可乘，便於六時五十五分，七時十七分冒險嘗試囘頭戰術，竟而成功，以致取得到日特　海戰戰術上的勝利。相反的，英國白有大艦隊而未得到殲滅的成功。納爾遜會在德雷機地下爲之一哭，即使不是研究戰術的人，也一定都會指責哲利科的懦弱無能。</p>
<p>在這一點上，東鄕元帥的確是偉大的，我們將士也夠能幹。雖然這都是大海軍國全體主力艦隊的大海戰，伹日本海戰時的日本却整個殲滅了敵人，而日特蘭海戰時的英國却一個也沒有捕捉住敵人。（　譯自中央公論六月號）（完）</p>

<p>經濟界　小言論</p>
<h3>小麥貸款</h3>
<p>商統會粉麥專業委員會對於收買小麥資金，業經與中儲銀行訂立協約，指定由中國交通兩行於六七兩月份中貸款十萬萬元，以爲收買小麥資金之需要；同時，上海各界華北急賬會，業經商妥華中運輸公司免費裝運　糧，其首批麵粉一萬包，即將轉運華北。</p>
<p>以上兩段新聞，好像是截然兩事，其實應當視爲有密切聯繫的，因爲，收買小麥的主要作用，我們前次已經說過，是配給粉廠製粉，供給民食需要；戰時民食需要，總是感覺供不應求，所以配給戶口米，就必須搭配戶口粉，於是麵粉的需要，乃有繼長增高之勢，以目前的華北急賬而論，麵粉需要，尤覺刻不容緩；麵粉尤其是最合於理想的幾糧，因爲華北人民是素來習於麵食。</p>
<p>十萬萬元貸款所收買的小麥數量，一定大有可觀。我們所希望的是：（一）把這次全部收買下來的小麥，儘量製粉，不作別用，停止製酒，以裕民食，（二）把華中配給必需部份以外的剩餘麵粉，掃數運往華北振濟，不必限於三萬五萬包的定量額。</p>
<p>在平時，所謂「春繭貸款」，「小麥貸款」，都是因爲繭季，或麥季的時令關係，循例貸款，以資收穫而已。在現在情形之下，這一類的貸款，尤其是小麥貸款，是富有重要意義與迫切性質的，不當再以尋常例行貸款的意義與性質去看待它。</p>
<h3>經濟局通飭各公會　商品不得擅自評價</h3>
<p>上海特別市物價評議委員會於本月五日恢復成立，其第一次委員會議所議決之（一）本市各種商品價格，以前未經經濟局核定，或最近未經評議會評定者，不得由各同業公會擅自評定實行。（二）本市各業同業公會應將四月三十日止，該業各種商品價格，詳細列具成本計算表，連同證明單據，送山評議會評定。（三）遵照中央法令規定本市各業同業公會，應負責監督該業會員商號，不得將各種商品批發於非會員，以防囤積。三案業經呈准市經濟局，於昨日通飭尸經改組成立之各業同業公會，切實遵照辦理。</p>
<h3>華股行號復業後　籌設證券交易所</h3>
<p>華商證券紗布雜糧麵粉金業是交易所，於事變時宣吿停業後，旋因政府取締投機囤積，於是各交易所之復業迄未成事實。自實業部頒佈取締華商股票買賣規則，嚴格管理華股交易，頃對依法註冊領照之華股行號，業已准予復業。今永昌等三十五家已遵照法令恢復買賣，惟並無華股交易之正式市塲，昨悉政府爲遵引游資入正當投資工商之途，聞已准許證券交易所之復業，由各證券商籌設「證券交易所」資本金二千萬元，依照有限公司組織，呈請主管官署註冊，發給許可營業執照，在政府監督指導之下交易，以前之交易所，以開折統一公債爲主要業務，今則因時制宜以政府核准之華商股票爲限，專做現貨款買賣，絕對禁止期貨交易云。</p>
<h3>市區紗布移動　應歸經濟局辦理　區公署不得代辦手續</h3>
<p>市府以辦理棉紗棉布之登記及核發移動證一事，應由經濟局辦理，方爲合法。茲據報滬西區公署，對於該區棉紗棉布之搬出搬入，有辦理補行棉紗棉布登記幷給發移動證及收費情事市府特令飭該署應恪遵前令，不得辦理登記，幷停止發給移動證云。</p>
<h3>紗布存貨記錄　應塡登記號碼　抗不遵辦當予議處</h3>
<p>工部局頃發布吿第六三八八號，通飭界內一切公私堆棧以及其他塲所，不論種類或性質（包括織染等塲所在內）關於各該紗布存貨紀錄，應添塡工部局登記證號碼一項，以資補充。倘此項登記證號碼在本月三十日以前無法確定者，可用書面向該局請求協助辦理，關於此事之申請書式，可於本月二十八日起，向該局第六二四號辦公室索取，並於七月三日中午以前送還原處。堆棧公司以及其他執有紗布存貨之人，倘有抗不遵照上項規定辦理者，該局當予議處。</p>
<h3>雜糧組將改爲　固本雜糧公司</h3>
<p>承辦軍配組雜糧配給之本市雜糧組行號聯合辦事處，近忽宣吿解散，據聞將改稱爲上海固本雜糧公司，最近辦理大豆靑豆蠶豆等配給工作，即係該公司此次配給，數額共有六千多包，申請期定於本月十七日截止。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股市突蓬勃，似已激動隠伏頗久之買勢。紡織業尤因紗市關係，永安紡織突出大關，步向高峰猛進，美亞綢廠所漲甚微，小票面鼎新染織有求少供，價照票面已升近倍。面貨業之永安公司一味進展，出關後尙在高昂中，成交頗旺，新新亦叩大關，國貨堅定。內衣突升。南洋烟公司驟然躍上，大中華火柴則隨升殊微。其他各業股較爲呆定。新藥業之中法藥房迂迴微漲，新亞堅持在大關外，五洲藥房反見做小。步降已久之文化業。亦稍回蘇，商務及中華兩書局回升，世界未聞成交，無價。地產來新益稍有做開，久安實業與通易信託均在買勢中堅定。康元製罐不乏買戶問津。其他各股亦多在上升中，人心挺秀，交易驟盛。</p>
<h3>各業公會動態</h3>
<p>機械廠業　本市機械廠業同業公會，自市經濟局指定鄭良斌等爲發起人後，即積極籌備就緒，於昨日下午二時在市商會大禮堂召開成立大會，除到會員代表三百餘人外，市經濟局派錢仲麟出度指導，公推鄭良斌傳守僕等爲主席團，除報吿開會宗旨，及籌備經過外，並通過會章，末即票選理事廿一人，監事五人。</p>
<p>絨線業　絨線號業同業公會，於昨日上午九時假市商會大禮堂舉行成立大會，計到同業代表一百餘人。市經濟局派吳保衡，市高會周鴻聲出席指導，公推孫桂生·孫志榮·馬維新爲主席團，票選首屆理監事，結果沈來席·孫志榮等十一人爲理事，王一鳴等三人爲監事。</p>

<h3>經濟編制如何可收實效</h3>
<p>— 崇德</p>
<p>日本依據對華新　政策而交還經濟編制權於中國，其用意不外爲希一華方之自主的經濟活動，活潑化，俾易復興其經濟，決不以個人利益本　位之自由主義經濟的復活爲目標。所以，漢視物黃之適當價格，或以囤積手段或用黑市交易而圖個　人的利益者，不能不間是違背　新政策的精神，而且中違背了參戰的　義。要之，物資之適當的價格，應由各該業自行規定，例如棉布，國在爲是和農村物資交換的物資。故儘量使其價格當的低廉，運　至農科，一面　量把廉眞的農村物質搬入上海，以謀生產的增强而期復興經濟，實定民生。</p>
<p>據聞一部份　商人對於採辦內一方面於上海，期在商統會以公定價格登記，設法獲得繼出證，實際上他們勾結　內地商人用利益均分的方法，以墨市價格，在內地出售，另一方面，以同樣方法收買物資而以高價　在上海脫售。因少數人圖一時之利，於是，十海與地的物資　交流盆加困難。四之增强生產來復興經濟　的道時郝份亦爲之阻塞，蓋經濟統制的籌載，唯有各業自身犧身犧牲　其一已利益，實行邊當的低物價政策，方才吿夠獲得實效。</p>
<p>現在不問上海，不問和平地區，因爲物價的無有制止狂漲，民生造萬極虞戲脅，經濟暴露着崩潰的危機。這不但是實施新政策的日本方面　所視爲重大的問題，且也是我們中國方面　所視爲比較困難的重大問題。切中日朝野，從今以後，應以公益爲先，抱定自我犧牲的精神，發揮編制經濟的效能，而復興上　與　地的經濟，因爲這處希望，無過於今日的迫切了。</p>

<h3>New Trends and Wartime Clothing Issues</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discussion on establishing new trends led us to propose a "Week of Frugality Practice," hoping that all sectors would pay attention to the seven specific conditions for practicing frugality. One of these conditions is "No extravagant clothing, no purchasing of expensive fabrics." Our suggestion may seem like a platitude, but it holds significant importance in the movement to establish new trends. The clothing issue is the foremost among people's livelihood issues. As the ancients said, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient can people know propriety and shame," placing as much importance on clothing as on food. Especially today, in wartime, the clothing issue is actually even more pressing than the food issue. This is because the wartime food problem arises not from an increase in demand but only from a decrease in productivity. However, in the case of clothing materials, in addition to productivity declining similarly to the decrease in food supplies, there is also the problem of increased demand. This is because the main raw material for clothing is cotton, which is also a crucial raw material for military supplies. For the needs of the war, a portion of the raw materials usually supplied for clothing must inevitably be reserved for military use. At the same time, in terms of cotton yarn and cloth, the increase in military-related needs such as army uniforms, and the increased consumption of cotton yarn and cloth for medical use for wounded and sick soldiers, all contribute to the problem. Therefore, in well-organized countries, during wartime, clothing materials must be given the same importance as food, and strict production and consumption controls must be implemented, requiring universal and practical frugality from the people.</p>
<p>From a national defense perspective, wartime clothing issues have the significant meaning mentioned above. From a political, social, and economic perspective, clothing is "that by which one presents oneself." In modern terms, besides maintaining body temperature and protecting personal health, it also has the significance of representing the wearer's status. Therefore, emperors of past dynasties stipulated that officials and commoners should have different forms, systems, and colors for their clothing according to their rank, and no one was allowed to overstep these boundaries, fully expressing the characteristics of feudal politics. In politics, this exposed the meaning of class, and in society, it created snobbish ideas, leading to the saying, "People only respect the clothes, not the person." Under this system and concept, unscrupulous individuals engaged in privately making imperial robes and garments, while ignorant country bumpkins spared no expense in bribing officials to wash away the "shame" of being a commoner. The decline of national customs throughout history has not been unrelated to this. Since the founding of the Republic of China, although the restrictions on clothing have been relaxed, new and distorted evil customs regarding clothing have arisen in their place. Everyone despises the inherent clothing system of our country and strives for novelty, hoping to shock the world and elevate their extraordinary status. Looking at the evolution of men's and women's clothing over the past two or three decades, it can be said that it is an unprecedented transformation in the past thousands of years. The manufacture of bizarre clothing, from raw materials to sewing, relies entirely on Europeans and Americans. In reality, the only standard for beauty is extreme extravagance and waste. The intention is to elevate their status with Western clothing. Therefore, it not only causes a major drain on the national economy, but also promotes luxurious habits in social customs.</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month, the Japanese cabinet decided on the "Implementation Outline for Simplification of Clothing Life in Wartime." This is in response to the current war situation, to reorganize large-scale enterprises in the fiber industry sector, and change their production situation. Therefore, the consumption of clothing by the general public must be regulated in order to form an overall decisive lifestyle system. The key points of the "Outline for Simplification of Clothing Life" decided by Japan are to reduce clothing material resources in order to distribute them evenly among the people of the country and to shift a large portion to more meaningful sectors. In order to implement "simplification," the Japanese people have popularized national uniforms and standard uniforms, thoroughly eliminating luxurious and extravagant customs. For employees of various government agencies, public organizations, and companies, official uniforms are worn across the board, sweeping away splendor and vanity and practicing wartime "clothing life." We believe that today China also has a real need to establish a policy of clothing frugality by the state and to universally promote a movement of clothing frugality among the people.</p>
<p>Our guiding principle for promoting a clothing frugality movement is to practice wartime national life, to improve social customs, and at the same time, to save useful manpower and materials to provide for the war. However, the clothing frugality movement that we want to promote has the following important preconditions: (1) It must be in line with the national conditions. Currently, most people in our country, except for a few nouveau riche and wealthy individuals from special classes, are in a predicament where they do not have enough to eat, let alone enough clothes to wear. Therefore, while strictly prohibiting extravagant clothing and bizarre costumes on one hand, we must ensure that everyone has clothes to wear on the other, in order to achieve fairness and benefit the people. For example, simply proposing slogans such as banning the wearing of Western suits is not something we endorse, because some people still rely on a few old Western suits to present themselves, and a blanket prohibition would result in the hardship of not being able to afford national uniforms or standard uniforms. (2) It must be appropriate for the times. We must not promote the restoration of ancient clothing at this time, with everyone wearing wide robes and broad belts, nor can we rigidly adhere to the old clothing system of our country, with everyone wearing blue robes and black jackets, or stipulating that men must wear long gowns and women must wear skirts. At the same time, we must never see the re-emergence of class restrictions on clothing. Except for military police or specific officials such as judges who need to be identified in their duties, we must oppose the class concept of clothing. We especially hope that leaders from all sectors of society will lead by example, such as wearing simple and convenient clothing. (3) It must be a principle that is suitable for practical needs and work convenience. Clothing should be suitable for health, convenience, and sufficient to enhance the wearer's active and self-directed spirit. For example, civil servants, educators, cultural workers, and freelancers can wear Zhongshan suits. Male and female workers, shop assistants, and apprentices in various factories can wear work clothes under the spirit of "labor is sacred." As for women's clothing, it is better to restrict the materials used than to stipulate the style, as long as it is not extravagant or wasteful of materials.</p>
<p>We further hope that leaders from all sectors of society will lead by example, advocate for clothing frugality, shift society away from the evil habit of judging people by their clothing, and restore the virtues of the ancient sages who wore cloth and straw shoes to influence the world. I remember that Guangxi was once known as a national model province before the incident, and its politics and society were praised by all sectors. At that time, the gray cloth clothing movement of the upper echelons was a turning point in creating a new atmosphere. There is no shortage of patriots in the Southeast, and it seems appropriate to work together to promote and create a new national spirit in East Asia, which would not only be a temporary benefit to the country during the war.</p>

<h3>Manchu Emperor Thanks Chairman Wang for National Government's Gift of the Tongguang Medal</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Mr. Kimura, Advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, Returns to Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Fukuoka, Mr. Kimura Masutaro, economic advisor to the National Government and advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, arrived here by plane from Shanghai at 1:00 p.m. on the 15th and immediately transferred to a train to Tokyo. According to Mr. Kimura's remarks after disembarking, "My purpose for returning to the country this time is to hear the Japanese side's opinions on the current settlement methods in Central and North China. The unit of settlement should strictly adhere to the exchange rate of 100 Japanese yen to 100 United Reserve Notes and 100 Central Reserve Notes to 18 Japanese yen. The two major changes that have occurred in the Chinese financial world recently are: (1) The Central Reserve Bank has become a clearing bank for entirely Chinese bank drafts. The Chongqing side tried its best to achieve this before the Incident, but failed to do so. (2) A discount market centered on the Central Reserve Bank has emerged. It is still a new initiative in China for drafts to be circulated on the market. This can not only prevent the outflow of funds and materials, but also allow for the formal commencement of resource development. Today's Central Reserve Bank has grasped the entire Chinese financial world and has become a sound national bank in name and reality."</p>

<h3>Advisor Ishiwatari Discusses Economic Issues in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Mr. Ishiwatari Shotaro, economic advisor to the National Government, after arriving here a few days ago, hosted a press corps on the 15th and gave a talk explaining the financial situation of the National Government and the future of the economy in South China. He stated in essence that the National Government's finances do not rely on public bonds and loans, but only on tax revenue planning, so it can be said to be a sound financial system. However, the fundamental problem is how to guide idle funds from Shanghai to the production side. This is being prepared by the Chinese financial community. The lack of materials, rising prices, and currency inflation during wartime are unavoidable phenomena, but it is important to make every effort to mitigate their impact. He is very optimistic about the current situation and future of the South China economy because the situation in South China is very different from that in Central China. There is no major price increase, and it is necessary for the National Association for the Control of Commerce to establish a branch in Guangzhou. Before consultations between China and Japan, the Japanese side should respect China's self-respect. Although rising prices are caused by unscrupulous merchants hoarding goods, a decrease in production is also an important reason. Therefore, he believes that revitalizing industry is as important in South China as it is in Central China.</p>

<h3>Impressions of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Ito Shoichi</p>
<p>An endless expanse of wheat fields, roads after the rain, vaguely visible within the wheat. Our group rode in military postal trucks, traversing the middle of the wheat fields, driving all the way. The sound of transport creaked, a pheasant foraging by the roadside, startled, flew into the fields. The setting sun after the rain dyed the remaining clouds red; the mainland is now nearing the solemn twilight. Here and there, east and west, farmers, from afar, looked like driftwood floating on water, some herding cattle, some pushing carts, in groups of three or five, hurrying home. Although the farmers had worked hard all day, there was no weariness on their faces.</p>
<p>"What a peaceful scene!" That friend, who grew up in the countryside, said to himself. Crossing the Yangtze River from Jiangnan, and from Yangzhou in northern Jiangsu to Taixian, along this road, I also felt a sense of peace. The wheat in Jiangbei seemed riper than in Jiangnan, and the countless graves buried in the fields also seemed to symbolize peace.</p>
<p>On the surface, northern Jiangsu is so peaceful. Later, I heard that on the road from Yangzhou to Taixian, bandits might appear, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>However, after staying in Taixian for two weeks, listening to various opinions, and conducting actual surveys, thinking about it on the truck on the way back, it was very different. On the way back, the wheat fields were busy with harvesting. Watching the farmers' hands rising and falling together, they seemed to be working very hard. However, this is their duty, planting and harvesting themselves, but the harvest does not belong to them, but to the landlords. What remains in their hands is just enough for some living, or perhaps not enough, living harvest. The landlords who live luxuriously in the cities, isolated from the countryside, would be satisfied if they gave these farmers the most basic living guarantee. Although there are ruthless natural and man-made disasters, northern Jiangsu still has enough harvest to support 12 million people, and the finances of northern Jiangsu are quite balanced. Then why do the producing farmers still suffer? What is the reason? This is because even if they have the will to increase production, they lack the necessary capital. Increasing production requires improvement, and improvement contains risks, so the landlords are extremely conservative. Now banks do not like to lend agricultural capital, because farmers have no collateral for loans. If I were to explain in detail the hardships I saw them endure, it would be a long story.</p>
<p>The reform of agriculture in northern Jiangsu concerns the entire agriculture of China. Let's just talk about agriculture in northern Jiangsu here! First, there is the issue of security in the peaceful areas. Second, there is the problem of the feudal or conservative economic organization itself. Leaving aside these political and economic conditions, in terms of the reform of agriculture itself, there are the following five points: (1) flood control, (2) water utilization, (3) fertilizer, (4) seeds, and (5) agricultural tools. Regarding points one and two, let's skip them for now. Regarding the third point, the fertilizers currently used in northern Jiangsu include soybean cake, night soil, river mud, etc. In fact, there are many places that should use chemical fertilizers. The soil in northern Jiangsu is not as fertile as we imagine. As for the seed problem, it is even more necessary. Taking rice as an example, the average yield in northern Jiangsu is three bags per field, while in northern Goshu in Japan, one field can yield about nine bags. According to the experimental results of a certain agricultural research institute in Nantong, planting Tosa No. 1 seeds using the same method as the rice in northern Jiangsu resulted in a 30% increase in harvest. However, farmers are afraid of the risks of improvement and still hold conservative ideas, so in the future, we must break this habit of adhering to old methods. As for the issue of agricultural tools, we can mention three types: tillage tools, harvesting tools, and irrigation tools. They still use the most primitive methods for the above three types of tools. For example, the hoe is mostly made of wood instead of iron, so it cannot be cultivated deeply. Not being able to cultivate deeply is a fatal blow to increasing production. (Yunpeng: Translated from the Mainland New Report, June 14)</p>

<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Kimundo (Mayor of Manila), head of the Philippine Observation Mission to Japan, and others arrived in Tokyo at 9:21 a.m. on the 15th.

<h3>The European Situation Becomes Increasingly Urgent A Three-Dimensional Decisive Battle is About to Unfold German Side Has Completed All Coastal Defenses The Two Major Camps are Competing for Air Supremacy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) The focus of the European war situation has shifted from ground combat to the stage of aerial decisive battles. On the Eastern Front, the German and Soviet armies are engaged in bloody air battles to compete for air supremacy. On the Western Front, Germany and Britain are also engaged in air raids against each other's homelands. In addition, on the Mediterranean Front, the air forces of both sides are engaged in fierce air battles to attack and defend naval and air force bases. It is generally believed that a three-dimensional decisive battle involving the sea, land, and air forces, a gamble on survival between the Axis and anti-Axis camps, will inevitably erupt. Therefore, the outcome of the European war situation is extremely urgent. If we look at the current European war situation from the relationship between the Mediterranean Front and the Eastern Front, we can imagine that the future trend of the European war situation will inevitably be as follows. After the anti-Axis forces captured Pantelleria and Lampedusa, it was reported that they had made them important bases. However, as of today, it is still absolutely impossible to think that they can use this to carry out a landing operation on the central part of the European continent. The reasons are roughly as follows: (1) After the Axis forces completed the defense barrier of the Atlantic Ocean in early May, there is no place for the anti-Axis forces to take advantage of to invade from the northern tip of Norway to the Bay of Biscay. Moreover, the Axis side is also actively strengthening its defenses in the Mediterranean coastal area, especially on the southern French coast, where the line of defense is extremely strong and completely fortified. (2) If the anti-Axis forces want to realize the operation of invading Europe, they need to prepare a large number of soldiers, weapons, supplies, and countless ships. However, even if they want to secure the minimum number, it will still take a considerable amount of time. (3) During the Washington Conference, the overall strategy of the anti-Axis camp was divided into two due to the heavy pressure of American public opinion. The general plan is for the United States to be responsible for the operations in the Pacific, and Britain to be responsible for the operations in Europe. As a result, the offensive of the anti-Axis forces on the European Front has been considerably reduced. (4) If the anti-Axis forces want to realize the operation of invading Europe, the Soviet Union must launch a major offensive on the Eastern Front at the same time. However, the Soviet army has not yet completed the combat power it should have when preparing for operations. Based on the above four points, it can be seen that the anti-Axis camp can only temporarily exert pressure on neutral countries such as Spain and Turkey from both political and military perspectives. Therefore, it is constantly instigating these neutral countries in order to use them. However, the Axis camp has prepared a perfect countermeasure for this, and the troop strength has also been completely transferred. The only slight problem is the bombing of the German mainland, especially the Ruhr area, by the anti-Axis air force. However, the German army will also take bombing as a means of retaliation. At the same time, it is actively carrying out concrete countermeasures for this, so the effect of the anti-Axis air force bombing has been significantly reduced and will soon disappear. In short, the Axis side has completely built the entire coast of Europe into an iron-walled fortress, and seems to be quietly waiting for the anti-Axis forces to launch an offensive operation before launching a major annihilation battle. However, the Eastern Front's evolution is closely related to this front. According to the Eastern Front, the German and Soviet armies are currently only engaged in air battles to compete for air supremacy. Although the Soviet news agencies have greatly publicized that the Soviet army has seized air supremacy, if we look at the communiqués issued by the German Supreme Headquarters, in addition to destroying an average of 100 to 150 Soviet aircraft a day, they have also continuously bombed key points such as Gorky, Volkhov, and Yaroslavl in the Soviet Union for eight consecutive days. From this, it can be seen that the German air force has gained absolute superiority in this area. According to a recent report by British Standard Evening News correspondent Brandt, who returned from Moscow, the Soviet army's mobilization capacity has no margin, which is a point of failure in future operations, and it can also be said that it is in a state where it is difficult to replenish after the consumption of troops. Therefore, it is expected that the Soviet army will adopt evasive tactics before winter, trying to avoid the consumption of its troops, and at the same time try to reduce the German army's combat power, rather than launch an offensive and be annihilated by the German army. However, in terms of the German army's operations, since the German army has occupied the Ukrainian granary and other strategically necessary areas, there is no reason to launch an offensive this summer. It may launch local encounters to gradually annihilate the Soviet army's combat power. In order to compete with the anti-Axis camp in the future, the Axis camp should conserve its combat power, refer to the Mediterranean war situation, and respond opportunistically, which is the best policy. Now the Axis has dominated the center of the European continent, and the three countries of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have been completely driven out of the European continent. This is no different from the situation where the anti-Axis forces are worried about the failure of operations because they cannot invade the Japanese sphere of influence in East Asia and the Southwest Pacific. "Time" is beneficial to the Axis side in both Europe and East Asia. The German army can obtain a good opportunity in an instant without straining its nerves, while the anti-Axis side has no choice but to sit and wait for death due to the pressure of "time."</p>
<h3>Italian Fascist Party Submits Letter to Mussolini Presents Nine Demands Suppress Attempts to Conspire and Disrupt Eradicate Transactions Inconsistent with Party Guidelines</h3>
<p>Rome, 15th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Italian Fascist Party Secretary-General Scorza submitted a letter to Prime Minister Mussolini on the 14th, stating the main points of the party's demands, saying that the National Directorate of the Fascist Party had resolved the following declaration. The National Directorate, in its determination to thoroughly resist, presented nine demands to the government: (1) For all attempts to conspire and disrupt the morale of the Italian people, new laws should be promulgated when necessary to resolutely suppress them. (2) Unify and control agricultural production. (3) Step up the rectification and control of the distribution of all materials. (4) Reduce various economic institutions to the minimum necessary. (5) Remove all red tape in officialdom. (6) Black market transactions are completely incompatible with the Fascist Party's guidelines, so all means should be taken to eradicate them. (7) Strictly crack down on luxurious restaurants in large hotels, clothing stores, and stores that are inconsistent with wartime regulations, and close them when necessary. (8) For all foreigners residing in Italy, those who are deemed unnecessary to reside should be repatriated or isolated. (9) Strictly and universally apply compulsory service laws. In addition, the National Directorate of the Fascist Party further demanded that all producers provide all their products to the state organs, which will distribute these materials fairly. It also requires workers and industrialists to devote themselves to their tasks with their greatest efficiency, and requires students, teachers, industrialists, and technicians to do their best to support the actions of the armed forces. It further requires Italian youth to stand up for their motherland on the battlefield, confirming the heroic spirit of the Italian people's tradition. As far as youth are concerned, the only thing necessary at present is Fascist Party ideology and Mussolini ideology. To practice the above ideology, there is only reading, working, and fighting. The Fascist Party bleeds for the motherland and always expresses the greatest respect for the Italian people who defend their motherland. It hopes that the Italian people will seek unity and solidarity internally and defeat the enemy externally. The mission of the Fascist Party is not only to form the only driving force at the center of the nation, but also to be responsible for protecting the nation to enhance national power and ensuring the ultimate completeness of the motherland's destiny.</p>
<h3>Axis Forces Abandon Small Island in Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) According to Reuter's news received here last night, the anti-Axis forces have occupied the small island of Lampione south of Sicily. The island is only 0.03 square kilometers in area, but it is just a large rock protruding from the Mediterranean. According to Reuters, there is a lighthouse on the island, and according to the Gotha Nautical Almanac published in 1940, there are no residents on the island.</p>
<p>Rome, 15th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to the statement of the special correspondent of the Havas News Agency, Pantelleria and Lampedusa islands in the Mediterranean Sea are extremely small in area and cannot be used as air force bases or naval bases. Even if Britain occupies them now, it will not help at all and can only be used as propaganda material. The size of Malta is twice that of Pantelleria, and the size of Gozo is the same as that of Pantelleria. It has long been proven that it cannot be used as a good air force base. In fact, because the four islands are small in area, their airfields can be destroyed by weeks of bombing. Lampedusa Island is even smaller. It is inconvenient for planes to take off and land. Pantelleria can still park planes, although it is more favorable than aircraft carriers that are easier to sink, it is also extremely vulnerable to air raids. Sardinia and Corsica do not have these shortcomings, and have more military equipment, so the opportunity for enemy planes to succeed in air raids is less. Pantelleria Island is only 100 kilometers away from Sicily, so Axis planes can go there freely at any time.</p>

<h3>Spanish Army Commission Holds Important Meeting</h3>
<p>Madrid, 15th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The Supreme Army Commission of Spain held a meeting yesterday, chaired by Minister of the Army General Cabanillas. There was a very long discussion during the meeting, but no official documents have been released. It is said that the Cortes Committee, which is responsible for national defense, will hold a meeting at the Cortes Palace on June 21.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles on All Fronts of Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) According to news from the Eastern Front, the offensive and defensive battles between the German and Soviet armies in the Orel region have gradually expanded to the northeast. By the afternoon of the 13th, the two sides had launched fierce positional battles for Mtsensk, a key point on the east bank of the Zhizdra River. The Soviet army attacked Bryansk in the Mtsensk region, attempting to recapture the Orel region in one fell swoop, but suffered a heavy blow after a fierce counterattack by the German army. Therefore, as of the 14th, there has been no change on this front. The Soviet army also launched a large-scale offensive in the area west of the upper reaches of the Donets River, but it seems to have been threatened and defeated by the German army's heavy artillery. In addition, the Soviet army in the eastern area of Kharkov is also trying to cross the west bank of the Donets River, but collapsed after being severely damaged by the German army. According to the German News Agency, the Soviet army in the Kupiansk bridgehead has broken its silence and began to attack in the north. After a long period of hand-to-hand combat, it was finally repelled by the German army.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Activity in Lisbon</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Havas News Agency reported that British Ambassador Sir Campbell visited Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar again on Friday and Saturday. Local political circles were surprised to learn of this, and were even more surprised to learn that US Minister Fish also participated in the second meeting. Another interesting piece of news is that the Spanish and Portuguese governments are currently exchanging views extensively through diplomatic channels. At a time when the anti-Axis countries are intensifying their military activities in the Mediterranean, their diplomatic actions in Lisbon are attracting great attention.</p>
<h3>Former British Secretary of War Attaches Importance to Increased Japanese Military Strength</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 15th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Former British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha published an article in La Razón in Argentina on the 13th, stating that the anti-Axis military's strategic air bases in East Asia were insufficient before the war, and now most of them, especially the most important ones, have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. He also said that judging the situation in the Pacific, one must first examine the fact that the Japanese military's combat power has greatly increased. Japan's position has greatly improved strategically and economically due to the acquisition of a large number of important areas. In addition, Japan's tonnage of ships has increased, so the Pacific War will be further prolonged.</p>
<h3>Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan and the Battle of Jutland</h3>
<p>— Masanori Ito (3)</p>
<p>(VII) Our Country's Pursuit and Britain's Evasion</p>
<p>When Admiral Togo's heroic figure appeared before the Russian fleet, which was heading north in peace on the morning of the 28th, he said, "This is great!" as if a lion had seen a rabbit. Commander Nebogatov raised the white flag without firing a single shot, and thus the Baltic Fleet, the last hope of Emperor Nicholas's all-in strategy against Japan, became a historical term and was completely annihilated. The time was 10:34 a.m.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that Admiral Togo's pursuit achieved results exceeding 100%. How exactly did Admiral Togo's pursuit proceed? He left the battlefield at 7:20 p.m. on May 27th and continued to head north in the dark night, sailing to the vicinity of Ulleungdo, about 100 nautical miles off the northernmost tip of Korea, and preparing the battlefield for the enemy's inevitable arrival the next morning. The Admiral directly led six battleships including the Mikasa, six heavy cruisers including the Izumo, and four light cruisers including the Naniwa, and ordered the 3rd, 5th, and 6th light cruiser squadrons to search for traces of the enemy. The fleet led by the Admiral himself had fires lit and was ready to depart from 5:00 a.m. At this moment, the enemy's remaining main battleships Oryol, Emperor Nicholas I, cruisers Admiral Apraksin, Seniavin, Izumrud, and a total of five vessels came forward. In addition, the ships that had escaped from the commander were all individually pursued and sunk by our forces, but only the cruiser Almaz and two destroyers escaped back to Vladivostok (six vessels escaped into neutral ports and were disarmed). Thus, the large fleet of 38 ships was completely annihilated, Russia's confidence in victory ended, and the overall situation of the Russo-Japanese War became clear.</p>
<p>Now, let's turn back to the Battle of Jutland. Jellicoe avoided night battles and futilely sailed 85 nautical miles south. Before the sun rose on June 1st (3:00 a.m.), the British ships were 12 nautical miles from Horn Reef, while the British ships were 30 nautical miles away. As a result, the German fleet leisurely entered its own mine defense zone. Because the six German ships were all old battleships, they had a speed advantage of three nautical miles per hour over the British ships. Moreover, the British ships were on the inner line, so if they had the determination to fight again, they could have easily rushed to Horn Reef and waited for the German fleet to arrive the next morning. The British fleet should have a "Jutland’s Tsushima Island," and should have constantly learned from the Japanese fleet's strategy of using Tsushima Island as a waiting point for the enemy to appear during the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan. However, Jellicoe voluntarily fled this battlefield, moving 30 nautical miles away. This is one point where British generals did not know how to achieve victory.</p>
<p>(VIII) One a Complete Victory, One Not a Victory</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the more obvious fact of avoiding pursuit. Readers may still remember Hipper's turn-away tactics. Perhaps you also remember how he changed course to avoid torpedo attacks, easily allowing the German fleet to enter and exit the bombardment zone. I have already commented on this description, but now I will make a comparison with the tactics employed by Admiral Togo during the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan. To make it clearer, I must add another note.</p>
<p>Admiral Togo captured the enemy flagship with sharp eyes, worked hard to advance and pursue, and forced the enemy to surrender. In Japanese army tactics, this is called "sticking attack." Approaching the enemy and attacking them fiercely while not letting go. This is a method of attack that does not allow the enemy to escape, and Admiral Togo put this army tactic into practice at sea. On the contrary, Jellicoe fought the enemy from the side, but when the enemy escaped, he naturally puffed out clouds of smoke while smoking a cigarette. If he had been a little more serious, he could have caught up and achieved great success with just one effort, or even a quarter of the effort, of Admiral Togo. Since Hipper himself frankly admitted this, there is certainly no mistake. Hipper said:</p>
<p>"He should have maintained his position. If they had all turned westward together and attempted to stubbornly approach us, our fleet would certainly have been surrounded further west."</p>
<p>If the British army had really acted in this way, everyone could understand the degree of hardship the German army would have faced, without Hipper himself saying it. Admiral Hipper was very worried about this. However, when he attempted to turn away at 6:35, Jellicoe did not pursue. Therefore, he seized the opportunity and bravely attempted the turn-away tactic at 6:55 and 7:17, and succeeded, thus achieving a tactical victory in the Battle of Jutland. Conversely, Britain had a large fleet but did not achieve annihilation. Nelson would have wept for this under the trees, and even those who do not study tactics would surely criticize Jellicoe's cowardice and incompetence.</p>
<p>On this point, Admiral Togo was indeed great, and our soldiers were also capable enough. Although these were both large-scale naval battles of the main fleets of great naval powers, Japan completely annihilated the enemy during the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan, while Britain did not capture a single enemy ship during the Battle of Jutland.

<h3>The Emergency Relief Association Negotiates with the T'ung-Jun Bank for an Advance to Purchase 10,000 Bags of Flour, Requiring Approximately 1.6 Million Yuan; Proceeds from the Charity Performance and Radio Broadcast Have Been Settled</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for North China sent a letter to the T'ung-Jun Bank yesterday, requesting a temporary advance of 1.6 million yuan to purchase 10,000 bags of flour to be transported to the disaster area for emergency relief. As for the proposed garden party, it is still pending formal approval at the third meeting of the standing directors. The details of the donation activities for the charity performance are as follows: (1) The charity performance held at the Great World the day before yesterday sold a total of 7,576 tickets, earning 15,152 yuan. After deducting the entertainment tax of 3,496 yuan and 62 fen, the remaining 11,655 yuan and 38 fen has been sent to the designated bank. (2) The radio broadcast by famous performers and singers organized by the Hebei Association in Shanghai has collected 47,240 yuan. The amount yet to be collected is 97,433 yuan and 20 fen, and staff were dispatched yesterday to collect it. (3) The Red Swastika Society has raised 62,750 yuan in donations. (4) The charity dance held at the Cathay Dance Hall the other day has been settled, totaling 53,701 yuan and 90 fen. (5) The full day's room revenue from the brothels yesterday, after deducting the Municipal Council tax and the extra small relief funds, has been allocated to emergency relief funds.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Ningbo Association has instructed fellow villagers to voluntarily donate and send their contributions directly to the designated bank for collection.</p>
<p>Leaders Set an Example of Public Service and Generosity</p>
<p>It is heard that Mr. Lan Ting, with his high social reputation, presides over charitable undertakings in Shanghai. His high moral character and prestige are admired by all sectors. He spares no effort in planning for emergency relief in North China and instructs his disciples to do their best. Now, ten of his disciples, including Han Jingqi, are hosting a banquet for Peng Yufu's 50th birthday and jointly donating 2,000 yuan. Mr. Han has led the Danyang Association in Shanghai for many years. His call to action will surely inspire a response. Also, besides auctioning off his family collection of genuine works by Lan Tian Shu, Mr. Hua Qinsheng, in the name of his beloved wife and sons, jointly donated 6,000 yuan. Zhao Youlong, a Taoist priest, is using his earnings from practicing medicine to provide relief, showing generosity and public service worthy of emulation.</p>
<h3>Mr. Li Tianzhen Broadcasts Peking Opera to Raise Funds for Relief</h3>
<p>Mr. Li Tianzhen, chairman of the Red Swastika Society, has a charitable heart and is always eager to help with social welfare matters. He has never lagged behind in these efforts. In light of the disaster in North China, Mr. Li is deeply concerned. Therefore, he has decided to broadcast Peking Opera this afternoon from the French radio station in this city to raise funds for relief. Mr. Li has profound knowledge of Peking Opera and rarely performs lightly. Now, for the sake of the suffering people of North China, he hopes that all sectors will actively donate and join in this great undertaking.</p>
<p>The Shanxi Association Cables about the Disaster Situation</p>

Fortunately, our chairman has embraced benevolence in his heart and compassion in his mind, ordering the handling of emergency relief in North China to soothe the disaster victims. His benevolent heart and benevolent government are admired by all. The Shanxi Association in Shanghai has benefited from this and is deeply grateful. We plead for the people affected by the disaster in Shanxi Province and respectfully express our sentiments. We eagerly await instructions. The Shanxi Association in Shanghai kowtows.</p>
<h3>Rising Inland Prices Hinder Procurement Efforts</h3>
<p>The General Association for the Commercial Control of Cotton and Wheat Transportation and Sales in Jiangbei has been actively carrying out the procurement of materials since the establishment of its internal organizations. However, the recent increase in the prices of various local products in the interior has hindered procurement efforts, especially for cotton and wheat. It is reported that the wheat and cotton stored in the Jiangbei area are being transported by merchants to Wuxi and then to other areas due to the abolition of restrictions on the transportation of materials. The relevant authorities are very concerned about this issue and are currently formulating various policies to prevent the outflow of materials.</p>
<h3>Colonel Iwasaki Flew to Japan Yesterday to Take Up a New Post</h3>

<h3>Permits Are Required for Moving or Storing Dangerous Goods; After Approval by the Municipal Council, a Permit Must Also Be Applied for from the Fire Department for Transportation</h3>
<p>The Public Information Office of the Municipal Council announced: Regarding the prohibition of storing dangerous goods, the Council issued Bulletin No. 5589 on November 11 of the year before last, stating that anyone wishing to store dangerous liquids or solids must obtain a license from the Council in advance. Application forms for licenses can be obtained from the donation and tax section of the Council. Applicants should fill in the nature of the dangerous goods in detail in the application form. Houses or venues that have not been approved by the Council shall not store such items. After the license has been approved by the Council, the applicant should also apply for a transportation permit from the Fire Department in order to transport the dangerous goods to the licensed house or venue.</p>
<p>There Are Obvious Misunderstandings Externally</p>
<p>Since the Council issued Bulletin No. 6343 on May 4 of this year, announcing the abolition of restrictions on the transportation of medicines and oils, there have been obvious misunderstandings externally regarding the application for transportation permits to transport dangerous goods. Therefore, it is announced again that if citizens wish to store dangerous liquids or solids, they should still apply for a license from the Council first. After the license has been approved, they should apply for a transportation permit from the Fire Department in order to transport the dangerous goods to the licensed house or venue, and must not be negligent.</p>
<p>Dangerous Goods Requiring Licenses</p>
<p>Licenses are required for storing the following dangerous goods: (1) Ketone, alcohol, carbon tetrachloride, petroleum ether, wax, carbon disulfide, collodion, alcohol, gasoline, hydrochloric acid, kerosene, paint, methyl acetate, petroleum ether, nitric acid, rubber cement, sulfuric acid, methyl wax, rosin, varnish, and other highly flammable dangerous liquids.

<p>If in Doubt, Consult the Fire Department</p>
<p>Furthermore, sodium hydrosulfite is not subject to the above measures (see Bulletin No. 6387 of this Council). If citizens have any doubts about the nature of the goods, they can consult the Fire Department, which will inform them of everything and provide guidance on how to transport or store dangerous goods.</p>
<h3>Applications for Half-Yearly Subletting Licenses Begin</h3>
<p>The period for subletting licenses in the Public Settlement for the first half of this year will expire on the 30th of this month. The Municipal Council's licensing offices in various districts have begun accepting applications for licenses for the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Application Locations Have Been Specified</p>

<p>Change in the Standard for Fees Payable</p>
<p>Those collecting application forms for license renewals should present their existing subletting licenses for the first half of the year. As for the license fees payable, the standard for previous periods was based on whether the sublet house had more than six rooms or six rooms or less. However, starting this period, the license fee payable every six months will be determined by the municipal rates paid quarterly. That is, for those paying 25 yuan or less in municipal rates per quarter, the subletting license fee will be 12 yuan; for those paying more than 25 yuan up to 100 yuan, it will be 24 yuan; and for those paying more than 100 yuan, it will be 48 yuan.</p>
<p>New Licenses Must Be Obtained on Time</p>
<p>It is heard that the Municipal Council has stipulated that license holders must return the application forms or obtain new licenses by the specified date, otherwise they will be fined, calculated at one yuan per day of delay. As for new landlords (i.e., those not renewing), their licenses, regardless of the district they belong to, should be collected from the office at 180 Fuzhou Road. These landlords should pay one yuan more than other landlords for the license plate fee.</p>

The goods from Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco and Chinese-owned Hexing Factory have been delivered on schedule, and all wholesalers and retailers have been selling them at their doors. However, there is still a portion that has not been distributed. The combination is awaiting orders to start distributing the goods after all the goods have arrived.

<h3>A Thief Was Arrested and Committed Suicide by Jumping from a Building</h3>
<p>Wu Zhiping, a 30-year-old postal worker from Ningbo at the Shanghai General Post Office, was transferred to the Bengbu Post Office last month, but took leave to come to Shanghai for medical treatment due to illness. However, due to his meager salary and expensive medical expenses, he could not make ends meet and was heavily in debt. Wu urgently wanted to make up for it, and on the afternoon of the 14th, he sneaked into the third floor of the Post Office on North Sichuan Road and stole a copper rod, intending to steal it out and sell it. However, he was discovered by the gatekeeper of the office, who arrested Wu and planned to send him to the police station for investigation. At this time, Wu suddenly thought that once he was sent to the authorities, he would be ruined. He decided to die and jumped out of the window from the third floor. His head hit the ground, his skull was fractured, and he died before he could be sent to the hospital. Subsequently, the Red Mouth Police Station received a report and ordered an investigation to clarify the process. The body was sent to the morgue.

<h3>Urgent Relief for North China: Report on the Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings</h3>

<p>Economic News Briefs</p>
<h3>Wheat Loans</h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Shanghai Business Association has reached an agreement with the Central Trust of China to designate the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to provide loans of 100 million yuan in June and July to meet the needs of purchasing wheat. At the same time, the Shanghai Relief Association for North China has negotiated with China Central Transportation Company to provide free transportation of relief grain. The first batch of 10,000 bags of flour will soon be transported to North China.</p>
<p>The above two news items seem like two completely different things, but in fact, they should be seen as closely related. As we have said before, the main purpose of purchasing wheat is to allocate it to flour mills for flour production to meet the needs of the people's food supply. During wartime, the need for food for the people always feels like there is an insufficient supply. Therefore, rationed rice for households must be supplemented with rationed flour. Thus, the need for flour has a continuing upward trend. Regarding the current urgent relief for North China, the need for flour is particularly urgent. Flour, in particular, is the most suitable ideal grain, because the people of North China are accustomed to wheat-based foods.</p>
<p>The amount of wheat purchased with the 100 million yuan loan must be considerable. What we hope is: (1) to make as much of the wheat purchased this time into flour as possible, without using it for other purposes, and to stop making alcohol, so as to increase the food supply for the people; (2) to transport all the surplus flour beyond the necessary portion for rationing in Central China to North China for disaster relief, without being limited to a fixed amount of 30,000 or 50,000 bags.</p>
<p>In peacetime, "spring cocoon loans" and "wheat loans" are usually provided because of the seasonal nature of cocoon and wheat harvests, following established practice to facilitate the harvest. Under the current circumstances, these types of loans, especially wheat loans, have important significance and urgent nature, and should no longer be viewed with the meaning and nature of routine loans.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Orders Associations Not to Independently Evaluate Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Price Review Committee was re-established on the 5th of this month. The resolutions of its first committee meeting were: (1) For various commodity prices in the city that have not been approved by the Economic Bureau or recently reviewed by the Review Committee, trade associations must not independently evaluate and implement them. (2) Trade associations in various industries in the city should submit detailed cost calculation tables, along with supporting documents, for various commodity prices in their industry as of April 30, to the Mountain Review Committee for evaluation. (3) In accordance with central government laws and regulations, trade associations in various industries in the city should be responsible for supervising member businesses in their industry to ensure that various commodities are not wholesaled to non-members, in order to prevent hoarding. The three proposals have been approved by the Municipal Economic Bureau and were issued yesterday to the reorganized trade associations in various industries for strict compliance.</p>
<h3>After Resuming Business, Chinese Stock Firms Prepare to Establish a Securities Exchange</h3>
<p>The Chinese Securities, Cloth, Staple Grains, Flour, and Gold Exchange announced its closure during the Incident. Subsequently, due to the government's crackdown on speculation and hoarding, the resumption of business of various exchanges has not yet become a reality. Since the Ministry of Industry promulgated rules to ban Chinese stock trading and strictly manage Chinese stock transactions, Chinese stock firms that are legally registered and licensed have now been allowed to resume business. Currently, 35 companies, including Yongchang, have resumed trading in accordance with the law, but there is no formal market for Chinese stock transactions. Yesterday, it was learned that the government, in order to guide floating capital into legitimate industrial and commercial investments, has approved the resumption of the securities exchange. Securities firms are preparing to establish a "Securities Exchange" with a capital of 20 million yuan, organized as a limited liability company, and apply to the competent authorities for registration and issuance of a business license. Trading will be conducted under the supervision and guidance of the government. The previous exchange focused on trading unified public bonds as its main business, but now, in accordance with the times, it will be limited to Chinese stocks approved by the government, exclusively doing spot trading and strictly prohibiting futures trading.</p>
<h3>Movement of Cotton Cloth in the City Should Be Handled by the Economic Bureau; District Offices Should Not Handle Procedures on Its Behalf</h3>

The Municipal Government has specially ordered the office to strictly comply with previous orders and not to handle registration or issue movement permits.</p>

<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market suddenly boomed, seemingly stimulating buying momentum that had been hidden for quite some time. The textile industry, especially due to the cotton market, Yong'an Textile stood out and advanced rapidly towards its peak. The increase in Meiya Silk Factory was very small. The smaller-denomination Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving was in short supply, and the price per share has risen almost double. Yong'an Company in the food industry advanced all the way, still rising after crossing the threshold, with quite active transactions. Xinxin also reached the threshold, and domestic goods were firm. Underwear suddenly rose. Nanyang Tobacco Company suddenly jumped, while Great China Match rose slightly. Other industry stocks were relatively stable. Among the new pharmaceutical industry stocks, Sino-French Pharmacy rose slightly in a roundabout way, New Asia insisted outside the threshold, and Wuzhou Pharmacy showed signs of weakening. The cultural industry, which had been declining for a long time, also recovered slightly. Commercial Press and China Book Company rose, and there was no news of transactions for World Book Company, with no price. Laixinyi in real estate showed some activity, and Jiuan Industry and Tongyi Trust were firm in buying momentum. Kangyuan Canning was not short of buyers inquiring. Other stocks were also mostly rising, and market sentiment was strong, with a sudden surge in transactions.</p>

<h3>How Can Economic Organization Be Effective?</h3>
<p>— Chongde</p>
<p>Japan, based on its new policy toward China, is returning the authority for economic organization to China. Its intention is nothing more than to hope for the independent economic activity of the Chinese side to be revitalized, so as to easily revive its economy. It is by no means aimed at reviving a liberalist economy based on individual interests. Therefore, those who consider the appropriate price of goods as something to be manipulated, or use hoarding methods or engage in black market transactions to seek individual gain, cannot but be said to be violating the spirit of the new policy, and also violating the meaning of participating in the war. In short, the appropriate price of goods should be determined by each industry itself. For example, cotton cloth, the country is in a position to exchange goods with rural materials. Therefore, efforts should be made to make its price as low and cheap as possible, and transport it to the countryside. At the same time, every effort should be made to move cheap rural materials into Shanghai, so as to seek increased production and hope for economic revival and stabilize people's livelihood.</p>
<p>It is heard that some merchants, on the one hand, procure goods in Shanghai and register them with the Shanghai Business Association at a public price in an attempt to obtain exit permits. In reality, they collude with inland merchants, use profit-sharing methods, and sell them in the inland areas at black market prices. On the other hand, they use the same method to purchase materials and sell them in Shanghai at high prices. Because a few people seek temporary profits, the exchange of materials between Shanghai and the inland areas becomes even more difficult. The path to increasing production to revive the economy is also blocked. The key to economic organization lies in each industry sacrificing its own interests and implementing a properly low-price policy in order to achieve effective results.</p>
<p>Now, regardless of Shanghai or the peaceful areas, because the unrestrained rise in prices has made people's livelihood extremely threatened and exposed the economy to a crisis of collapse. This is not only regarded as a major issue by the Japanese side implementing the new policy, but also a major issue that we on the Chinese side consider more difficult. From now on, both China and Japan should prioritize public interest, embrace a spirit of self-sacrifice, give full play to the effectiveness of organized economy, and revive the economy of Shanghai and the inland areas, because this is a hope that is more urgent than ever today.</p>
