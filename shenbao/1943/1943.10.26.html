<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>談最近物價</h3>
<p>自從棉紗棉布收買命令頒布以後，各種物價，相繼下跌，宛如久睛之後得到甘霖，大家稍舒窒息。可是，下跌難，上漲易，下跌一，上漲十，已為近年物價變動的通則。根本上的物價上漲原因，未能澈底解決，依然有死灰復燃之勢。</p>
<p>在棉紗棉布登記期間，零賣棉紗布商店，戶限為穿，賣者傾銷，買者爭購，商人企圖逃避登記收買，消費者預防過渡時期無貨可買，以及避免黑市高價之苦。道是彼時商人與消費者的心理，現在巳經兩個月了，事實的證明，這種心理並未錯誤。因為紗布現在登記收買期間，配給尚未實施，目前市上無貨可買，而黑市奇昻。在這種塲合，不免使小我利益的個人主義抬頭，自詡為先見之明，因而重貨輕幣的心理，仍未能一網打盡。</p>
<p>日前肥皂在登記期內，一般商店與消費者之傾銷與爭購情形，正復與棉布相同，不過肥皂配給之購買證，業已發給，而市上零數仍可購致，，其情勢不若棉布的嚴重。凡此種種事實經騐，大可提供管理物價以及研究物價問題者的參考。</p>
<p>據一般估計，九月份物價總平均指數，比較八月份下跌二成以上。物價下跌，自去年六月以來僅同年八月略有下降之外，按月遞漲，尤以今年六七八月之交，漲勢最厲，迭見高峯，而九月份之跌勢，其原因當為一般國戶鑒於紗布之收買，深恐範圍擴大，殃及自身，同時，市上銀根驟形緊迫，乃相率紛紛出籠國貨，形成供過於求之局面。</p>
<p>更進一步分析，各種物價中以衣料所跌最多，原因自為紗布收買，國戶欲圖逃避而傾銷跌價。而以食物所跌最少，共中白糖黑市目反上漲。食米黑市雖稍趨跌，但正當新穀登塲，依照慣例，市價必定回小，同時受一般物價下跌之影響，其下跌之比例，應不止此。而事實上所以如此者，本市米價之漲落，其原因並不繫於產米區域的供給如何，而視四郊封鎖之寬嚴如何為轉移。其次自七月份以後戶口米數量減少，最近官價又增，與不減量不增價之原則，適相逕庭。所以，米價難於下跌。</p>
<p>食物中與米糧同樣重要，最足影饗於一般人民生活者，厥為菜價，尤以蔬菜為平民階級普遍的佐食品。本月份較之上月更見增漲，殊為目前物價問題中最應注意而亟圖抑制的一項。據前日報載，中央市塲積極採辦各種蔬菜陸續運滬應市外，同時，繼續評訂標準限價，涿日公布，各組合經紀人必須切實運行，不得故意超越。事實上四郊農村對於蔬菜的供給量，向不匱乏，近來各種靑菜叉屆陸續採割之期，祇須疏暢來源，並防止中間者的非分剝削以外，論理蔬菜價格不至於再漲，而應回小。中央市塲以及物價有關當局應重視蔬菜價格之與平民生活關係密切，以及蔬菜之與平民營養健康關係之重要，竭力設法抑平，消極的限價固屬需要，但須注意有價無貨，等於空心湯　吃不飽。積極的疏通來源，減少農人運轉上之麻煩，以及中間之剝削，切實抑平售價，有官市者有貨應市，使平民對於蔬菜的享受權利，不受高價威脅而剝奪以盡。</p>
<h3>日臨時議會成立　今晨開全體會議　東條首相將發表施政演說</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日不第八十三肩臨時議會，二十五日宣告成立，由政府上奏天皇陛下裁可，即日下午以官報號外公布召開議會之詔書。</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日第八十三屆臨時議會，已於二十五日召集，是日貴，衆兩院議員於上午九時分別出席，貴族院議員三百零二名，於九時三十分在全體會議塲聚集，衆議院議員前於上午十時在全　會議塲聚集，分別屨行議院成立儀式。兩院成立後，由政府及兩院相互通告，於茲八十三屆臨時議會遂告成立，開院典禮定於二十六日舉行，隨即舉行全體會議，以軍需公司法案，防空法改正法律案，兵役法改正法案等十四件法案及追加預算案為中心，審議三日·二十六日之貴，衆兩院全體會議中，將由東條首相發表一般施政方針演觀，闡明非常重大時局下，國政實施大綱及適　大東亞建設發展階段中，大東亞外交之根本方針，披瀝政府完成戰爭之決意。此次臨時議會即自二十六日起正式開始，於二十五日之召集日，曾審議政府提出之法律案。</p>
<p>日閣議正式決定　本年度追加預算</p>
<p>東京廿五日中央社電　日本昭和十八年度追加預算案，二十五日之閣議正式決定，即由情報局將其發表，並將提交第八十三屆臨時會議。　此項迫加預算額，其一般會議計爲一億二千九百萬七千元，特別會　爲七百零三萬元，其中大部份係充作日政府前爲確立決戰行政實施劃期的施政，新設置農商省，軍需省，運輸通價省及移管各省間事務之所需經費。日政府對於此項歲出追加額，　以十八年度預算實行眸之歲人超過額償抵之，故昭和十八年度預算額實際上並未增加。劃期戰時財政　健全運營也。</p>
<h3>印人在昭南島　開民眾大會　慶祝印臨時政府成立</h3>
<p>昭南二十五日中央社電　印人為紀念印度臨時政府　立，曾於二十四日下午四時在昭南市政府前廣塲，盛大舉行民衆大會，鮑斯主席於熱烈歡迎中準時薄塲，檢閱儀兵後昇旗，由印人　老丁名為鮑斯主席佩戴軍刀，擁戴禮成。繼由日軍某部隊長宣讀日政府正式承認印度臨時政府之通吿。依次披露日滿泰等國視電。鮈斯主席復向民衆演說，略謂：由於日本之正式承認，吾人今後竇負有較完成獨立更為重大之實任，並報吿與英笑宣戰及致謝日故府等閣議決定事項，六時許大會閉幕。</p>
<p>昭南二十五日中央社電　印臨時政府二十四日下午八時假昭南偕行社別館，招待日印關係代表，舉行晚餐會，出席日方軍官民代表及印人關係者多名，席間會就臨時政府成立之經過及印度獨立運動之將來，作種種懇談，迄十時始散。</p>
<p>昭南二十五日中央社電　印臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯頃宣稱：緬旬已於二十四日正式承認該政府。</p>
<p>江特拉鮑斯對記者談話</p>
<p>昭南鳥二十五日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯，二十四日在昭南市會見記者團，就臨時政府樹立聲明典記者團問答如次：（問）今後臨時政府為完成獨立運動所實行之具體案如何？（答）我等現在所努力者，在使印度民衆展開獨立運動，不惜任何犧牲期完成此述動。（問）對英。美宣戰後予印度國內之影饗如何？（答）我等印度國內之同志，將受一大感動，立於不同立塲之人士，亦可認識此運動之算　性。又因臨時政府樹立後，日本等國已先後正式承認。並已對英·美布告官戰，敵方必亦覺悟事態之嚴重。（問）臨時政府之樹立與對英。美已靑宣戰。對渝政權有何影響？（答）余不深知最近褕方情勢，而該政權之一部，實不前英美，尤其英國之對印強　政策，尚有反對英·美政策之一派，我等樹立臨時政府。對英。美布吿宣戰，將來一旦開始進攻。此一派之僧念，當更形堅固。英。美謂此次之戰爭目的在擁護民主主義，但不承認印度之自由，日本則為正義而戰，並已承認緬甸，菲律賓獨立此次更承認印度臨時政府，此等事　，孰是孰非，今巳昭然若揭，相信所予渝方影　甚大。然若英國永遠握有印度之支配　，則渝方將不能覺悟抗戰之非計，而仍期待開通緬甸公路，獲得最後勝利，但一　印度國民軍　至印度國內孟加拉，阿薩密兩省獲得解放，則渝方渴望緬旬公路之開通之至絕望，經由問薩密省之運愉物費，亦必杜絕，渝政權如此或可明確覺悟抗戰之無益。今余所不顧　渝方呼籲者，耳因渝方尚未反省將來孟加拉，阿薩密兩省完全　放，余必對渝政權作一呼籲。（間）國民軍之士氣如何？（答）據與國民軍有　之第三者批評，國民軍於過去數月間已有極大發展，全體將士於「　德里去」之大旗下士氣愈旺盛，今後國民軍無退卻·只有前進或戰死。</p>
<h3>孟買發生　激烈地震</h3>
<p>廣州二十五日中央社電　據印度廣播電合　播，孟買地方二十四日下午二時許發生激烈地震，損害似極大，至其眞實情形，目下正在調查中。</p>
<h3>南太平洋海戰　一週年紀念　日某中佐談激鬥經過</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　十月二十六日為「南太平洋海戰」一週年紀念日，亦即日。美艦隊於南太平洋聖克魯斯羣鳥北方徉上相遭遇，演出一凄絕無比大海戰夕日。僅此一日，美艦隊損失計有航空母艦三艘，戰艦一艘，巡徉艦三艘，驅逐經一艘，艦型不詳者三艘，飛機二百餘架，此外尚有驅逐艦一艘受重創。日軍所　戰果之大，可謂空前，由是一戰，敵艦隊乃不得不將艦隊決戰主義韓為基地推進主義，改變其作戰方針，茲錄曾參加是役之某艦某中佐囘憶一年前情形談話如次：南太平徉海戰，乃具有多數空母集團之敵艦隊，為呼應瓜達康納爾島作戰，數次對日艦隊大規模接戰而來之最大規模海戰，敵軍於去年八月上旬，佔據瓜達康納南島筏，因不甘於第一，第二次所羅門海戰所受之痛擊及為支援瓜達康納爾島登陸部隊，乃逐次集中海上兵力，於所羅門方而前後兩月之久，圍繞所羅鬥眾島作虛實無定之對時形勢。敵軍為誘使。艦隊入其勢力範圍，始終不出其飛機威力所及之地，南太平徉海戰即係叫為中敵誘敵之計，暗則衡其攻勢，而實行迅雷不及掩耳之攻擊，由是一戰敵軍勢大衰，藎除喪失數艘空母外，其他損失亦至重大，因此其後於該方面乃不得不將艦隊之海上作戰主義政為基地推進主義。而是役敵艦隊之蠢動，已為日方所料及，故是日黎明派出偵察機探悉敵方大艦隊正由聖克魯斯勢島西方北上，乃立即遣出空中攻擊隊及布置空中警戒網，布置方畢，敵艦上機大編隊，即已出現於日艦隊之上空，於茲此壯烈之激戰遂吿展開。日方空母二艘，巡徉艦一艘，因而蒙受損傷，然觀敵方，其艦隊被日軍空中攻擊隊冒死襲擊而被擊沉者，則為空母三艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦三艘及飛機機二百架被擊落，戰果之大實為空前。按空母攻防力之特性，其所搭載之飛機待於艦上時，乃攻擊最大之時，然艦上機尚未完全飛起。即命中敵彈，而致引起多已數方炸彈爆炸　，　亦為防禦力最弱之時。反之，全機一旦起飛終了，其防　力亦立即成為最佳狀態，此乃與一般軍艦不間之點，故敵方倘早被發見，則攻防力即因而倒置，此亦為勝敗之所關，南太平徉　戰日方所以獲勝，損失最小，即因發見敵艦較早，而得制先攻擊敵艦。日將兵於此海戰以生命獲取之偉大戰果，實為全體國民劇心銘骨，永久不能忘懷者，蓋是役日軍將兵衝破敵軍鐵桶防禦陣，駕愛機肉搏，敵空母發射魚　後而自炸者有之，駕俯衝轟炸機中敵空母後，而復直街敵護衛　而自炸，使其發生大火者有之，又於母艦上之高射角砲測量員從事戰鬥中不幸兩手受重傷，而以口　其　尺柄，繼續從事砲戰之如此壯烈美談，實不勝枚舉。此一生不能忘懷之南太洋海戰，於今已過一年，而戰爭之大勢亦已較前允趨嚴重，故願後方國民勿忘此海戰之重要，全體奮起，挺身以赴戰爭。</p>
<h3>日駐菲大使館　舉行開館禮　菲大使伐爾加斯就職</h3>

<p>馬尼刺二十五日中央社電　菲律賓首任駐日大使伐爾加斯氏之就職典禮，已於二十五日正午於總統府嚴肅舉行，洛勒爾大總統以次閣僚及參議管均出席。</p>
<h3>南太平洋各島嶼　日軍地位益堅固　美承認將作長期艱苦戰</h3>
<p>里期本二十五日中央社電　　西南太平洋反軸心司令部巴貝將軍稱：美軍將在士平徉作艱苦之長期戰爭·美人尚未傷日軍之　宋·倘美軍前進與之接觸，則日軍又堅鞀起來矣，美人之主要困難·乃係日軍已前進至目前之地位，而美人須推之使囘，放將來對日作戰或為兩棲之性質，因日軍已在多數之島嶼上做成堅固之地位，倘不能佔領該項島嶼，則似不能逐之使退也，美人自有其作戰之計劉。但有應注意之事件，謂當吾人接近日軍之時·日軍之抵抗力卽加強矣。</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　南太平徉日軍某基地電。日海軍機曾於二十三日未明急襲新不列顛敵方之鳥德拉克島及特羅布軍安島，敵方防空砲火甚熾烈，日機炸毀地上敵戰鬥機兩架後安返基地。</p>
<h3>波根維爾島　空戰益熾烈</h3>
<p>昭南二十五日中央社電　敵機攻擊波根維爾島，最近益形　烈，不顧犧牲，連日來襲。二十一日農以統一式重轟炸機，葛拉門式戰鬥機等連合編隊四十二架。來襲該島東　日軍陣地。日海軍戰鬥機隊即予迎擊，在空戰中擊落其葛拉門式戰鬥機五架，二十二日晨又先後出動四發動大型轟炸機及中　轟－機共計百二十六架戰鬥轟炸機連合大編隊、日海眾戰鬥機隊及地上部隊相互協助，以機槍及高射砲猛射，將其擊退，迄今判明，被日軍地上砲火擊落者有轟炸機三架，日方並未受損害。</p>

<h3>聶伯河下游前線　攻防戰達最高峰　德方宣布放棄梅立托波爾</h3>
<p>柏林廿五日中央社電　德元首行營廿四日午發表公報稱：德軍在　立托波爾市內作戰數日後，巳於廿一日夜至廿二自市內撤至該市西郊外。</p>
<p>柏林廿五日中央社電　德元首行營戰報稱：東終中南二路各焦點之大攻防戰，巳於日昨達到特別激烈之階段，蘇軍數師團由梅立托波爾之南至榮普魯基之東南在一狹窄之戰綫上發動攻勢，當經擊退而　以重創，德軍陣地數處凹陪，旋卽被塡平。在尼普目特羅夫斯克（克里卓之東南）敵軍藉重霧為掩蔽，由兩側進攻。在聶伯河西　建立橋　堡數處。克里曼卓東南方之突破點，敵向德防綫猛攻，德軍即報以反攻，敵巳在克里伏羅格加緊其突破攻勢，澈戰刻正在進行中。斯摩倫斯克之西亦有澈戰，敵眾突破之企圖，已因德軍之英勇抗戰而遭粉碎，且德軍於反攻時，即克復其暫時失去之陣地，敵軍數小股被殲滅，東綫其餘戰區則僅有局部接觸，兩日以來蘇軍在亞索夫海及克里曼卓之間，共損失坦克車二百八十二輛。</p>

<p>在尼普貝特羅失斯克之西北缺口處，蘚軍以新到之步兵與坦克車師團沿全綫發動進攻，以德軍之側面以及克里伏伊羅格前之德軍陣地為對象，克里伏伊羅格前之德擲彈兵，在蘇軍坦克車數集團之强大壓力下。不得不向西撤退其戰綫，但同時德軍側面之陣地，則仍在順利防守中。蘇軍於星期六日僅在該區一處，損失坦克車共七十八輛。基輔之北，德步兵與坦克車隊在勇敢之襲擊中，將蘇軍向東擊退，並奪得大枇戰利品，戰俘一干名以上落入德軍手中。蘇軍企圖突入中部聶伯河德軍陣地之攻勢，為德步兵堅決之防禦所阻。在斯摩倫斯克與奧爾廈間之公路上，德防軍於防禦戰之第三日亦大獲勝利，蘇軍巳增援其砲隊，並在重霧掩藍之下，以坦克車與摩托化步兵數隊加入作戰，德軍不得不暫時撤退。其前面之陣地，以使德砲隊充分發揮其防禦力，經數小時之激戰後，德擲彈大獲勝利，致蘇軍不得不撤退至原陣地。現東綫北部僅有局部之戰事發生於拉多加湖之南，是日下午，蘇軍突破入德軍陣地，但該處缺口立即在德軍反攻中予以封合，蘇坦克車四輛落入德軍手中，同時另有十一輛不能行動。斯坦巴里亞島</p>

<p>氏於最近發表對反軸心兵力過於分散於世界各戰綫之事實，加以警告，謂英美軍隊在地中海區之後備兵力，並非用之無竭者，而用此兵力於過份廣大展開之陣綫上，實使此區之戰事行動發生危險，且英國軍隊不能同時以足夠之兵力在各綫上發動數個大規模攻勢，反軸心軍力之過度使用，實足以减低其力量，此英軍事評論家之言論，乃係對在緬甸開始作戰之愚行而發。在緬之行動實”不智，因其足以影響地中海之行動。渠未稱，假使反軸心能佔　甸，而以削弱地中海方面之力量為代價，實得不償失也。</p>

<h3>增强戰力的　根本問題</h3>
<p>在決戰下增强我們的戰力，有怎樣的內容呢？應如何對處呢？茲於下列各項詳細加以叙述，然問題旣極深刻，又甚複雜。其中心固為航空機工業，但戰力增强問題非僅與此有關，且和全戰爭經濟關聯，乃係遂行　及決戰國內體勢全般的總力戰之根水問題。鑑於此項問題之複雜　與重要性，擬於最初提出若干根木項目，加以明白考察。</p>
<p>第一，增强現下決戰階段的戰力，必須抱航空機第一全義。迄今為止的戰力增强。係鋼鐵·石炭·輕金屬。船舶及航空機五大產業併行齊進，置超重點於此五大產業，是基於。謂超重點主義的。在這以前，並未特別指定產業，乃是以　謂重點主義為前提的。但在今日，平面的超重點主義是不　的。五大產業的重要性目前固未稍威分毫，尤其是增强造船力，確為我人不得不加以强調的要務，但　五大　業　以此為準的重要　業併立，而予以所謂特例及優先的生產增强方式，則已是航空決戰接連發生的階段以前的東西了。</p>
<p>固然，行政上之特例是應擴大於全重要　　的。但特例擴大並不止是行政上的一種刷新，政府遭次決定的「國內能勢强化方策」,乃欲斷行全而行政運營的決戰化，適應此階段的戰力增强方式，必須是以航空機生產為項點，於航空機工業系列整備的基礎上，確立重點產　的立體態勢。我們首欲强調者即為此點，在這意義下這次的「國內態勢强化方策」，應以軍需生產之急速增强，（特別是飛躍擴充航空戰力）為目標。</p>
<p>第二，現下瑜强戰力所最惑必耍者端在飛機船舶的建造，故必須以確立大量生產樣式為目的。當然，為實現急速的增產計，增　狹路何在，須就實際情形　確檢討，並須勇敢打開此狹路。為打　狹路之故，行政的查察誠極迫切，而國內實源的活用亦屬必要，所以目前的增產方策，不外是實施克服此急切狭路的施策。但我們的敵人是英美。無論一機一船，固皆應儘早生產，唯單憑逐漸打開常面的增產狹路，果能壓倒敵方的「量」嗎？深思此點是必耍的。三個月後的幾千架幾萬噸，根本上是比一年後的幾萬架幾百萬噸更為重要。</p>
<p>是以不僅止於所謂打　狹路，更須克服一切障碍，確立大量生產樣式。然而此事需要一定的期問，時期一失大量生產樣式之確立是不可能的。不，更要緊的是趕不上決戰的時期，正如西南太平洋補給戰之日益深刻，我們不得不痛感目前戰力增强的要點是在急速轉向大量生產制。</p>
<p>然則航空機第一主雜之確立是輕而易舉的嗎？又，大量生產制的實現是容易的嗎？不。在今日的決戰經濟下，解決這兩個問題實非易事。因此，產業人須更深切反省；同時，確立正眞決戰行政　是不可缺的，這個問題祇右在一慷國民精誠團結以作決戰的配置，由立於其總力結集之上的決戰經濟體制始可解決。</p>
<h3>日本增強生產力量</h3>
<p>即我們對於　下的戰力增强問題，不僅視之為是單純的戰力增强問题，並認為牠是和强化國內態勢不可分　的問題。這是我們所欲强調的第三點。</p>
<p>政府在前舉「國內態藝强化方策」中，雖巳闡明「講求於經營上更明確表示重要企　之　家性，及確立生產責任制等諸般措施」之旨，但關於此處所說的生產責任制之內容，則須與「方策」之具體化合併檢討，始充　切吧。</p>
<p>不過，座產責任制的實施，並未變更以上所述的戰力增强之主眼點，蓋「於經營上　明確表示重要企業之國家性」，是和上述產業人的反省同義的：因為生化「大景生產」計，應先實施之於航空機工業</p>
<p>增强戰力的要求</p>
<p>增强應付決戰階段戰力的要求，更進而要求決戰行政的前進。應此要求，為徹底强化國內的防衛事態，且爲確，政府已本異常的決心決定「國內態勢强化方策」，據此以圖行政運營的決戰化。茲擬檢討至今的決戰行政之過程，以明這次一行政運營決戰化　的必要性。</p>
<p>生產行政的發展</p>
<p>隨着戰局的擴大，戰時計劃經濟亦益趨高度化，基於國家的意志，經濟統制已一路强化。但是，主管官應却因產業部門而異，甚至在同一部門內亦有此種現象，例如資材關係則　商工省，勞務則歸厚生　，資金，經濟關係則　大藏省等。遭種監督實廳各不相問的所謂官僚統制，業巳暴露劃據全義之弊。所以本應確保計劃生產的經濟統制，反離其主觀的意蘭而阻害生產的增强，於是生產行政的刷新久成縣案。依據重要產業團體令的統制會方式，乃係對於官僚統制之自己批判的產物，又為以去秋大政　贊會中央協力會議為契機，在民間抬頭的軍需省設置論，即其表現之一端。</p>
<p>而且戰局在去歲下半期巳入接連展開凄愴壯烈的決戰的新階段，為摧毀英美的總反攻計，迅連且劃期的生產增强已成急緊的課題。隨這種客觀情勢的進展，生產行政亦以去年末為一　機，急速展開，決戰的性格日趨濃厚。</p>
<p>第一即為去年十一月廿七日內閣會議的決定設置臨時生產增强委員會。此項措置的目的，端在避免所謂改革行政機構，而圖憑藝運用以統一產業行政。其次，在第八十一屆議會又成立戰時行政特例法及許可認可臨措置法；更於三月十八日的內閣會議中決定和右述兩法律表裹一體的戰時行政權特例及內閣顧問制，戰時經濟協議會制度　行政查察使制度，又創設地方行政協議會等，於生產行政的運營上加以劃期的刷新。</p>
<p>由於上　戰時行政非常立法，官廳割據主義，已被遏制而確立向產業行政綜合統一化前進一步的勢態，殊無疑義。由於首相指示權的發動，過去那種關於生產增强的所管官廳之爭執及各省之間的意見對立，乃得解消洛而過去所指摘的官　統制之弊，亦告糾正。</p>
<p>又。戰時行政聯權特例明確規定鋼鐵，石炭，輕金屬，航空機及船舶為槪大重點產業（第一條）　　體標揭決戰階段的緊急增產目標。欲將資材，勞力。資金，動力等有一定限度的各種生產要素迅速而有效的化為戰力，停止過去那種面面周到的－－從而也是分散的－－生　擴充方式，　極當然，而重點生產之因此顯著　化，也是無擬的</p>
<p>他方面，內閣顯問制則在動員民問專家的知能與經騐，以期增强五大重點產業的生塵；顧間的創見與研究，將成為政府的各種施策而予以活用。至於查察制度，為五月鈴木國務相，的調查京地方之製鐵業，七月藤原內閣顧間之察勘束北北海道地方的製鐵業與採煤業，九月下旬藤原顧問之調要航空機工業，業巳先後進行實地調查三次，由此檢討物動計畫等重十政策如何滲透下部機構而具體化，以及發見生產狹路之存在何方等，本就地即決主義，於刷新生產行政，把握生塵實狀為收得甚大的效果。尤其是藤原顧問的查察，頗顯其多年在民間所得的經騐能力，即應生產狹路的打開，生產效力的向上及生產條件的變化，在生產技術之刷新等多方面。查皆有所成就。</p>
<p>生產行政的根本刷新</p>
<p>與重點生產呼應，為民問協力體制的協力會組鐵遂告成立。如衆所周知，飛機典造船乃是綜合性的工業，祗有在零件，原料等一切有關產業營巳擴充整備的某礎上，始能順利發展，況且如鋼鐵、石炭、輕金屬這類原料部門，倘若不能確實得到資材和般備，亦難望期能夠急速增產，因此以五大重點塵業為中心的生產增强，其前提條件常然是和相關的產業作有機性的協力。在這意義下，航空機工業去年十一月即已成立，陸軍航空工業會，確立統括飛行機、發動機、裝備機材、材料、零件等全部的協力體制。至如其他鋼鐵、石炭、輕金屬及　舶等四大重點產業，也於三月廿五日經「重產協」的斡旋，以右述四項產業的統制會為中核，組織由密切有關的產業所構成的「協力會」；各協力產業統制團體並和重點產業統制會締結生產品的供給協定，完整了協力推進重點生產的體制。</p>
<p>為完遂上述重點軍需物資的生產增强，生產行政之改良以及與此對應的民間協力體制，雖正逐漸整備，但符合決戰階段所要求的生產行政決戰化，尚不能說僅此巳定。即如以上各節所闡明，為完遂超重點生產起見，各有關產業的調整，實為一大問題。蓋車輛、航空機用工作機械等，固可適應現實的必要，以五大重點產業為準而決定辦法，但生產行政茍未根本刷新，或戰爭經濟指導未探本溯源予以檢討，則順應現實必要而擴張的重點產業，結果必成「這加預算」式的添增，因而減少重點生產的意義，頗有再陷於羅列的，平面的生產增强方式之慮，</p>
<p>所以確立眞的超重點生產體制與夫根本刷新推進此種體制的生塵行政，實屬至要。所以，由於「國內態勢强化方策」的決定，業巳到達劃期的階段。　吉（自同盟世界　報二十四卷第四號）</p>

<h3>培養聾啞人材的　上海福聾啞學校</h3>
<p>艱苦奮鬥</p>
<p>上海福啞學校的上層組織，是董事會，與上海盲童學校相同，由熱心於慈善事業尤其是殘疾兒童教養事業的王叔賢先生任董事長。汪校長兼任教導主任，共右專任教員六位，四女二男，其中有二位是聾啞人，其餘都是健全熟心的靑年，他們都曾受過特殊師範教育的訓練，富於教育經騐，特別同情於聾啞者，願意自我犧牲，以教養聾啞兒童為終身事業。看到他們和她們那種教導孩子們的親熱與墾切的態度，不禁發生一種崇敬的感激的心瑰。</p>
<p>福啞學校的歷史雖然不怎樣悠久，然而由於領導者和教師們的艱苦奮　與認眞工作，十冬年來，已經表現出相常輝煌的成績。據汪校長說，該校歷屆舉畢學生。約逮三百人。至少有百分之六十都獲一得職業而且時任愉快，共餘百分之三十升學或專攻藝術。在戰前，如商務、中華，世界各書局印刷所，都右該校畢業生服務，尤以在雕刻名家扛小　處服務的人數最多。據稱現在中聯電影公司為藝術股副主任的汪銘傳君，就是院作廣告畫的也不少。還有許多畢業生理智爲推行聾啞教育而勢力，在母校的有胡慧卿，陸英廉二軍聯　君，在漢口聾啞學校的右蔣錦秀君，而在上海各聾啞學校的也不少，其中如光震聾啞學校校長兼中華聾啞學校教務主任李實清君及滬西聾啞學校之陳租耕君，尤爲傑出之士，汗校長還不絕口的稱譽他們呢。</p>
<p>正因為上海福亞學校的教育成績　然，所以不僅本市一般人士，都遣送聾啞子弟去求學，即外埠學生也都聞名欣喜，遠道負笈而來。特別是因為對於　苦無告的壟啞兒童。同樣盡力配置，並且擔任其衣食費用，撫育共成爲社會有用的人才。所以各慈善團體紛紛遣送聾啞兒童前往請求教養，現在校裏就有慈善團體聯合救災曾養濟院送去的六名，信德社的二名，兒童保賣會的二名，慈幼協會及第一區公署兒童保障料送去的也右。可見社會對該校之需要程度。</p>
<p>前途瞻望</p>
<p>依據福亞學校的調查統計，我國每十萬入中約有聾啞人一百人，以人口四萬萬計，即達四十萬入，其中學齡兒童，至少占十萬人。然現在全國壟啞學校其計祗右二十　校，專門教師不出一百，　　　啞平生不足一千、可見百分之九十以上的聾啞學齡兒童尚在失學狀　之中，師資之缺乏更不待說，這是何等嚴重的現象。上海是全國聾啞教育最發发的地方，學校　全國總　三分之一，共達七校之多，然而大都規模極小，所收學生少老十數人。多者亦不過數十人，其不足以應社會之實際需要，可無待論。而且像上海福啞學校那樣辨有規模與成　的，尚陷於極度困難之中。無法發展呢。</p>
<p>上海福啞學校素無某金，所右開支，全恃學雜費之收入，舊工部局每年略有補助，惟不敷甚鉅，只靠校董會及熱心人士之捐助，但是該校一向不主張向外大規模幕集捐欵。所以無時不在拮据之中。該校申請上海布　病教濟協會補助函中即痛陳其苦衷說：　…　欵無方，羅掘俱窮。慘淡經營，於茲十有七載，如任其停頓，則過去棉薄，悉付東流，聾啞兒童，均將失學？沉淪堪　」，曾由該會李文杰委員前往調查屬實，後經常會決定一次補助三千元。骸校開支，原不其大，教職員月薪無超過二百元者，每日二粥一飯，常年素食，其清苦以致極度。但因教養聾啞雖童：加以聾啞教育所需設備均較普通教育爲繁，所以經濟上的困難，仍有與日俱增之勢。注校長檢示本年八月至明年一月的學期預算，收入包括學，，雜，宿，膳費及第一區公署補助費三千五百元在內，共計三萬四千七百元，支出包括水電，房租，房捐·薪工，教育用品費·修理·雜費·添置·膳費等，共計八萬八千一百餘元（其中薪工八千零四十元），不敷之數達五萬三千四百　元。這是有待於社會上特別熱心的人士給與援助了。據汪校長表示該校有希望三點：　籌募基金，增加免費學額，並救濟流浪期造就。因爲壟啞人雙目雙手無恙，具備工作條件，祗須甲乙知識訓練，即可爲對社會國家有益的人材。　聾啞兒童讀書，不易瞭解，必須以實事實物多方指導，方能慢慢領悟，所以該校希望在社會協助之下，添購標本儀器。並進而成立圖書館。研究室，以為師生　修之助。　該校原有職業科，培養專門技術人材，如果社會給與右力的援助，甚至如縫　科所需的縫衣機導，使能在短時期內恢復擴充，並增設聾啞工作實騐室，乃至創辮工傷，以增生，並增設聾啞工作實驗室已消滅聾啞文盲及貧苦以人力補救天然之缺陷，並可積極的化社會分利份子慶有意義的事情。（完）</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>經濟血脈</h3>
<p>假令金融可以喻作經濟的血液，無疑地，運輪可以喻作經濟的血脈了。血　的功用，在於流通人體的血液。否則血液雖足，亦無補於人體的健全。戰時經濟體制之健全與否，固視金融調劑之有無，尤視運輸能力之強弱。譬如，言增進生產，必須首先解決生產的原料問題；試問有原料而無中運輸，則原料何由變為製成品？言強化配給，必須首先解決物資之來源問題；試問有物資而無由運輸，則物資何所補於消費者的需要？總之，強化運輸機構是解決生產與配給的基層工作。否則，棉花　管收買了，仍不能恢復工廠的活勁，米糧盡管收買了，仍不能解決民眾的饑荒，那末，一切的一切，豈不都是空言無補事實嗎？</p>
<p>可是，「工　善其事，必先利其器」，言強化運輸而無充汾的運輸工具，運輸依然是無由強化起來的。因此，我們曾經主張大規模的艦造水船，通暢航運，形成一個由木船到工廠，由工廠到木船的循環運輸動態，俾資解決交流物資與增加生產的兩個課題。最近，廣州爲呼應日本內地造船，乃利用當地資材，建造機器帆船，其第一，第二，兩艘已經下水，第三艘已在動工，第四第五兩艘又在着手進行建造中。此種再接再厲，努力邁進地利用當地資材，增進運輸工具的一個做法，實在值得我們華中經濟界人士的仿效，尤有頓於交通與實業當局的提倡，籍以貫通我們的經濟血脈。</p>
<h3>粉麥專委會頒佈　粉麩移動辦法</h3>
<p>粉麥專業委員會，自著手統一採買並集中配給移動辦法及證明書問題有所不明，最近粉麥轉會特頒佈辦法三項，茲探悉大要如次：　當地問移動，十包以下，須得當地中日同業公會或其他事務所方面之證明書；卞包以上，除規定手續外，尚須右粉麥專業委員會分辦事處之證明。　各地區間之移動，須有各同地粉麥專會分辨事處及糧食局之必要入，除規定者外，尚須且備物資許可處許可許可證　得通行。</p>
<h3>天津游資流滬　當局謀抑止</h3>
<p>華北之天津，等於華中之上海，過去乃對外貿易之唯一口岸，商業繁盛、游實充塞‘自太平洋戰事發生，天津租界收囘後。過去在租界區內專事投機囤橫之游　，在當局</p>
<p>厲行統制</p>
<p>之下，逐漸失　其活動餘地，迄淤目前，天津當為之管理市場，嚴　圍積，及制止各重主要商品之自由買賣，較上海更嚴，因此大量游賣奔避無路。一般　資者，不得不多方設法，為本身</p>
<p>打開出路</p>
<p>以謀生存。故最近天津游資，右流來上海之影響，惟詳細數字，無法統計。茲悉有關方面認為津地遊資之大量南移，將來對於上海金融不無云。</p>

<h3>商統會現階段諸問題</h3>
<p>商統會自三月十六日成立以還，歷已七月，實　物資統制，從事確立中團經濟之自主的統制體制，一切工作，正在逐步推　中，關於商統會本身的性格，運用的方針，以及認為尚有發揮高度機能的必要，今後之趨向如何，頭為一般人所注目，茲将商統會的各種問題，作一　觀。</p>
<p>成立迄今的經過</p>
<p>商统會是以自治的物資統制機關性格而誕生，其最大巨的，在求抑平物資，安定民生，以期增強戰力，而實現中日經濟提携。不過最近有一部份人　對商統會，頗有批評，其批評中心，約右下列三點：　商統會本身的缺點。　經濟人協力的不充分。　商統會與各關係當局的關係。茲再分述如次：　　商統會本身缺點</p>
<p>第一個問題，商統會的物資統制業務，從自由經濟轉入統制經濟以來，已歷七閱月，假使眞能理解中國經濟現階段的情况，那末大家定會明瞭實施統制經濟的困雖了。至於機構的整備，在中途有實有注重於確立其他重要物資的收買機構，因之一般人批評商統會太重機構形式，沒有考慮現在的中國經濟機構與統制經濟的司能性。同時須知其推進工連帶及政治，關於此點，尤應特別考慮。</p>
<p>經濟人協力不充分</p>
<p>第二個問題，有一部辦的商統會，辦理物資移動與輸出入許可時務及統制收買，配給物資，無異自由經濟的重現，故有若干經濟人不肯協力此項政策。</p>
<p>這就成了助長投機國一積的原因，民族資本不能運用於確保物資與增強生產方面，反而變成收買物反的途徑。</p>
<p>要打開此種焦點，對內必須改革該會的內部機聯繫，上次商通惠改　行打開這焦點的　辦法，間接也是促進協力的方案。</p>
<p>有關當局的關係</p>
<p>商統會的改隸行政院，童義甚大，一切由行政院決定施策，着商統會去推動，這就是避免實業部，糧食部的多方監督，而明確自洽機能與監督系統，但僅僅如此，還是局部的對策，所以今後的問題，還是要使商統會充分活動。</p>
<p>有力人士對此表示意見，認為第一點雖有自治機關的性格，但關於物　統制的一切業務，不能　　推進，第二，應眩確立國家費水經商統會而可以指導民族資本的體制，　三，缺乏經濟施策的綜合</p>
<p>今後的新方向</p>
<p>以上所述的同題如果不能根本解決，則商統會的合理運用，不能期望他比現在更進步，故當局應的工作。</p>
<p>商統會于本月份改組棉花專業委員會，另設棉花部，舉凡一切棉織品業務，統歸該部草擬方案處理，可為內部機構改革活動之一例，又今次國府　業部長的更迭，在今後的運用上亦大可期待，由此而觀，今後的商统會　國府的關係，愈將往切。所以商统會現巳脫出初期階段，而進入元成眞正目的的第二階段了。（企實：　　十月二十五日大陸新囤積生物必需品當予懲處</p>
<p>物資調查委員會，自成立以來，積極調查家商號，或私人存　之紗布，朱經依法申　登記，或朱申請出賣，已經查封懲處，並將囤貨沒收充公。茲悉第二期自九月十六日起至十月九日止，已查之廠商，計有九百六十四家，其中大小紗布廠四百〇五家，紗號八十七家，淪號八十四家，棉　廠十四家，染　廠三百六十八家，　庫六家。均已報告審登中。聞該會刻正調查針　廠之存紗，並即將擴大範圍，調查生活必需品。及有關軍用之物資，如查有囤積行為者，即常依法懲處。</p>

<h3>故都秋色　健兒們的活躍</h3>
<p>秋風　人們振奮掙扎的好時光。我國古時常以秋日為行軍征伐之時，就是文塲競考也是定於秋天·現代人　更利用秋天來集會。今年北京秋天天氣特別好·於是也就有許多給健兒們一顯身手的機會。已經開幕的是十月十八日的國立各院校秋運會·是國立專科以上院校生活　　委員會總會主辦的·參加的有北大·文·理·法。農·工，　六學院，師大及男附中，女附中，附小，和外語專校，　專等。參觀者有王委員長代表·張仲直政務廳長，敎　蘇體仁餐辦王　勳署長和各機關代表　數萬人，類極一時之盛。除了一些　體表演之外，就是　徑餐，男女田徑　的總　軍是師大·所可惜者，破記錄的成績一件也沒有，難道是營　不足的緣故嗎？正在計劃舉行的有治安軍的秋季檢閱，據說「檢閱之日程行事表册，現均　擬定，其他　備，各事宜亦均已　　就緒，預定本月內即將開始云」，另外又有新民會全體聯合協議會的　備，已「決定於本月二十六至三十日集華北一億民素之代表在京中兩海懷仁堂盛大舉行」。最可注意的是這一次的全聯還　集　華北各地靑少年關一萬五千之衆，舉行大檢閱。這些都是值得注目的戰時的秋操。</p>
<p>農事的試驗場</p>
<p>從北京出了四的門到萬壽山去其中有一條尊嚴的古道，雖然現在是加上了柏油，變成了現代化的道路，但是兩旁蒼老的　楊黃　時定過去實在可以使人興起「古道夕陽」的感覺。參戰後的第一次雙十節，秋高氣爽。天氣特別的溫和，即者就到四郊去訪古。無意中，在四直門與萬壽山的中途，看見了一座非常現代化的建築，屋頂高竪中日兩國的國旗。這建築物原來就是新近落成的華北農事試騐塲。</p>
<p>華北農事試騐塲是二十七年四月間開始經　的一個機關。原名中央農事試騐塲，二十九年六月才改名為華北農事試驗塲。場長是秋元氏，本來的塲地是在太平湖民國大學的舊址，後來因為塲址太小，就於二十八年間開始，在西郊興工建築新址，最初先在新址設立技術人員訓練部，後來就隨着那一部工竣就遷入那一部，到現在是全部完工，也就整個的遷了進去</p>
<p>華北農事試驗塲設有七科，計耕種科，農林化學科，病蟲科，農業水利科，林業科，畜產科，家畜防疫科等。又設秘書，文書，會計三課。另外又開辦了農業技術訓練部，專為養成農業技術人員，學生都是初級中學學業生，再經過兩年的訓練，就算是畢了業。現在　業的已有五班，人數約有五百名。</p>
<p>在北京以外，這華北農事試騐塲還設立有一五個支塲　石門運糧城。，濟　靑島　封。另外還有一分塲在昌黎，二試騐塲在濟靑和徐州，十三個原　團在南苑，彰德保定，邯鄲城陽唐山　縣　安張店臨淸卒集，臨汾　新鄉等地。</p>
<p>新建築共有三層，第三層是禮堂，第二層是各科，第一層是三課和各科分據着。除了這建築外，四週還有一萬一千畝左右的農圃，　橫小麥，眾，高梁，玉蜀黍，水稻，棉花，麻等農產物，是一個規模極大的農場。　說這　北農事試驗塲還　於本月十五日舉行新厦落成典禮，來慶祝這戰時的龐大的經濟機場的形成哩。（十月二十日）</p>

<h3>迫於眉睫的麥作　增產工作</h3>
<p>— 楊</p>
<p>遭幾天，正是稻的收穫將完了，麥的播種將開始的時期。在作物收穫的時候，應該加强其統制，使其供求合理配給適當。在作物播種的時候，則廳指導其技術，以期品質改進，生產增加。近來，關於米糧統制的論文，已經見到很多，關於麥作增產的討論，似乎尚待發揮</p>
<p>秋播作物中的小麥，在糧食問題上實有着與米相等的重要性。尤其在米盈缺少的今日，麥的地位日見增高。卽以滬市民食而論，如果沒有戶口麵紛的搭配，則其嚴重性恐將數倍於今日。</p>
<p>京滬綫常州以束一帶，固然均以粳米生產為主，麥作甚少。但是蘇北·皖南，鎭扛附近·漢口以東，以及南甯綫（南京與蕪湖）沿綫，均為秈稻區，因為秈稻的收穫　甚早，刈割後卽一體播種小麥。故小麥播種的地區，並不亞於稻　。</p>
<p>我國農家，對於稻　技術的研究，已臻相當精湛的地步，故稻作改進工作，比較上不容易見效，麥作則類多祖放，只要稍加指導，便可克收宏效，茲舉最重要的麥作改進事項如下</p>
<p>推廣良種麥之　　量與種籽之優劣大有關係。事變前金陖大學曾育成二九〇五小麥一種，其生產量可較普通品種之小麥增加百分之三十二。現在是項品種雖因保存不良而不免稍趨退化，但是百分之二十以上的生產增加率總可保持。去歲實業部在各地設立之農業改進區，卽以推廣二九〇五小麥為主要工作，免費分發農民，曾收相當成效。現在小麥卽將播種。各地方政府機關，急宜設法獲致大量二九〇五小麥，推廣於農民。該項品種，向糧食部增產司方面探聽，或者可以獲得。</p>
<p>溫湯浸種小麥最嚴重之病患，為黑穂病，其損失量相當於稻之螟害或蝗害。受病麥粒，外蔽薄膜，內包黑粉。此病防止之法，則共簡單。只須在播種前，用溫湯浸種法，將種子加以消毒即行。其法先準備兩個大桶，其一盛入攝氏四十九度（合華氏一百二十度）之熱水入攝氏五十六度（合華氏一百三十二度　之熱水，　　浸桶。於是將種子裝入竹籮，先浸入溫桶，待種子全部溫熟後，再浸入浸桶，經五分鐘取出，灌注多量淸水。使其速冷，即可播種，或陰乾後儲藏待用，如果在溫湯浸種之前，更用鹽水浸種法，以淘汰浮於表面之劣種，而選取充實之佳種，效果更佳。　指導條播京　）帶農家播種小麥，多用撤播法·對於中耕除草及施肥工作極不方便，以致影響產量甚大，且浪費肥料，（普通條播者每畝每回施肥一担，而撤播者則須一担牛），故亟宜指導其改用條播法，惟條播在播種時所費時間較多，農民一狃於積習，多不肯聽從，　加開導。</p>
<p>普及肥料　肥料是增產的重要元素，現今農民或因　費，或因實力，，殊堪隠憂。必須加意勸導。麥作肥料之自給者，有堆肥及糞尿兩種。堆肥每畝約需十　，牛一頭每年可產堆肥一百担，供麥田十畝之用。家畜如鷄，鴨、羊等之糞尿，及人糞尿，亦為麥作最伴之吧料。每人每年排洩之糞尿，約一担半，可供一畝麥田，一次施肥之用。至於化學肥料、以磷肥之製造及普及　為急須。因硫酸錏須費極大資本，出產無法徒增，磷肥原料，可從動物骨骼中獲得，較為簡便。惟其製造及推廢，則有待於專家的研究和政府的　導。</p>
<p>以上四點，係麥作生產最急切最簡便的方法，只須右實行的決心，加以策動，則成效可以立見。現在各地小麥，在此一月內即將全部下種，希望　心糧食問題者對此加以注意。</p>
<h3>同業公會的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 水兆熊</p>
<p>從時間，地位範圍的角度來側視，同榮公會誠　末不足道。但是他所負的使命卻很重大。牠是會員的大家庭，是同業的集合體，凡是會員廠商所感受的痛癢，一個優良的同業公會，是通同一致的。再說一句，會員廠商的苦悶，正是同業公會的苦悶</p>
<p>日前同業公會究竟有些什麽苦悶呢？就是一天到晚多半忙着「無中生有」的事體。誠如上海特別市政府第一二一八五號佈制物品亦時有被醫留難情事殊屬非是」。正因為不免有這等情事，以致同業公會，就要忙著去交涉，一人不夠，二人同去。有時還耍另外拉上熟人去說項。爲了一件事，重重公文。分頭投送，等有囘示，或再派員，或再簽呈。而被留雛之會員、則或以電話，或親來　候　鎭日竟天，等着希望增決。有時被扣之貨已一處提出，不幸又被另一處攔住。如此往復。交涉，多方說項，以致整個公會就忙着這種「無中生有」的事體。雖說或由於員醫一時對於統制物品鑑別為難，而且已由當局佈告一慨不得籍故留難，自望情形好轉，但是在旁人看來。總以為辦理公會的人有些「庸人自　」可視誰曾知道</p>
<p>在在不免有被留難的情形，同業公會的交涉止如在跳攔，工會的工作人員正如跳攔的運動員。我們不斷地跳攔而過，就是為着要達到一個完成的紀神。我們不政奢望會沒有一個阻攔，也希望每一阻攔不要太高太大。同樣在商言商。對於政治，不敢過存奢望，只希望做到如孔子所說的「政者正也」之義，再詳細些說，一般廠商的希望，誠如明治大正昭和三朝日本財界中最高指導者澀澤榮一翁所指陳的「政治既非勢，亦非力，政治顯然不能不是道德，這是政治的根本。站在不黨不派的工商立塲來說同業公會所希望的是政治與道德的結合，　也可以說是工商階級的政治觀念。</p>

        <h1>1943.10.26</h1>
<h3>Concerning Recent Prices</h3>
<p>Since the issuance of the order to purchase cotton yarn and cloth, various prices have fallen successively, like a long-awaited rain after a drought, giving everyone a slight respite. However, it is difficult to lower prices, but easy to raise them; a drop of one unit is followed by a rise of ten, which has been a general rule for price fluctuations in recent years. The fundamental reasons for the increase in prices have not been thoroughly resolved, and there is still a tendency for the embers to rekindle.</p>
<p>During the period of registration for cotton yarn and cloth, retail cotton yarn and cloth shops were crowded, sellers dumped their goods, and buyers competed to purchase them. Merchants attempted to evade registration and purchase, and consumers prepared for the transitional period when there would be no goods to buy, and to avoid the suffering of high black market prices. This was the psychology of merchants and consumers at that time. Now, two months have passed, and the facts have proven that this psychology was not wrong. Because during the current registration and purchase period for yarn and cloth, allocation has not yet been implemented, there are currently no goods available on the market, and the black market prices are incredibly high. In this situation, it is inevitable that the individualism of small self-interest will rise, boasting of foresight, and therefore the psychology of valuing goods over currency still cannot be completely eradicated.</p>
<p>The situation of dumping and competitive purchasing by general stores and consumers during the recent soap registration period was exactly the same as with cotton cloth. However, soap allocation purchase certificates have already been issued, and small quantities can still be purchased in the market, so the situation is not as serious as with cotton cloth. All of these facts and experiences can provide a reference for those who manage prices and study price issues.</p>
<p>According to general estimates, the total average price index for September fell by more than 20% compared to August. The decline in prices, since June of last year, has only seen a slight decrease in August of the same year, and has increased month by month, especially between June, July and August of this year, the rise was the most severe, repeatedly reaching peaks. The reason for the decline in September should be that the general public, in view of the purchase of yarn and cloth, was deeply afraid that the scope would expand and affect themselves. At the same time, the money supply in the market suddenly became tight, so they all rushed to release domestic goods, forming a situation of oversupply.</p>
<p>Analyzing further, among various prices, clothing materials fell the most, and the reason was naturally the purchase of yarn and cloth, as the public wanted to evade it and dumped goods at reduced prices. Food fell the least, and the black market price of white sugar actually rose. Although the black market price of rice has slightly declined, with the new grain entering the market, according to custom, the market price will inevitably rebound slightly. At the same time, affected by the general decline in prices, the proportion of the decline should be more than this. The reason why it is actually so is that the rise and fall of rice prices in this city is not tied to the supply in rice-producing areas, but depends on the strictness of the blockade in the suburbs. Secondly, since July, the quantity of household rice has decreased, and recently the official price has increased again, which is contrary to the principle of not reducing the quantity and not increasing the price. Therefore, rice prices are difficult to fall.</p>
<p>Among foods, what is equally important as rice and has the greatest impact on the lives of ordinary people is the price of vegetables, especially green vegetables, which are a common side dish for the working class. This month's price has increased even more than last month, which is a matter that should be given the most attention and urgently suppressed in the current price problem. According to a newspaper report the day before yesterday, the Central Market is actively purchasing various vegetables and transporting them to Shanghai to supply the market. At the same time, it continues to assess and set standard price limits, announcing them daily, and each group of brokers must earnestly implement them and must not deliberately exceed them. In fact, the supply of vegetables in the rural suburbs has never been lacking. Recently, various green vegetables have also reached the harvest period. As long as the source is unblocked and the excessive exploitation of intermediaries is prevented, in theory, vegetable prices will not rise again, but should decline. The Central Market and the relevant price authorities should pay attention to the close relationship between vegetable prices and the lives of ordinary people, and the importance of vegetables to the nutrition and health of ordinary people, and try their best to suppress and stabilize prices. Passive price limits are certainly needed, but it is necessary to pay attention to having a price but no goods, which is like empty soup and cannot satisfy hunger. Actively unblocking the source, reducing the trouble for farmers in transportation, and the exploitation of intermediaries, and effectively suppressing the selling price, with the official market having goods to supply the market, so that the rights of ordinary people to enjoy vegetables will not be threatened and deprived by high prices.</p>

<p>Japanese Cabinet Officially Decides on This Year's Supplementary Budget</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) — The supplementary budget for the 18th year of Showa (1943) was officially decided at the cabinet meeting on the 25th and was announced by the Information Bureau and submitted to the 83rd Provisional Parliament. The amount of this additional budget is 129,007,000 yen for the general account and 7,003,000 yen for the special account, most of which will be used as the necessary expenses for the establishment of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Ministry of Military Supplies, and the Ministry of Transportation and Prices, and the transfer of affairs between the ministries, which the Japanese government previously established to establish an epoch-making administration for decisive battles. The Japanese government will offset this additional expenditure with the excess revenue from the implementation of the 18th year budget, so the amount of the 18th year of Showa budget has not actually increased, which is a sound operation of the epoch-making wartime finance.</p>
<h3>Indians in Syonan Island Hold Mass Rally to Celebrate Establishment of Provisional Indian Government</h3>

<p>Jiangtela Bose Speaks to Reporters</p>
<p>Syonan, 25th (Central News Agency) — Jiangtela Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, met with a group of reporters in Syonan City on the 24th. The questions and answers between the Provisional Government's establishment statement and the reporter group are as follows: (Question) What are the specific plans that the Provisional Government will implement to complete the independence movement in the future? (Answer) What we are striving for now is to enable the Indian people to launch an independence movement, and to complete this movement at any sacrifice. (Question) What will be the impact on India after the declaration of war against Britain and the United States? (Answer) Our comrades in India will be greatly moved, and people standing in different positions can also recognize the authenticity of this movement. Also, because the Provisional Government has been established, Japan and other countries have successively formally recognized it, and have officially declared war on Britain and the United States. The enemy will also realize the seriousness of the situation. (Question) What impact will the establishment of the Provisional Government and the declaration of war against Britain and the United States have on the Chongqing regime? (Answer) I don't know much about the recent situation in Chongqing, but a part of that regime is actually against the United States and Britain, especially against Britain's strong policy towards India. There is still a faction that opposes the policies of Britain and the United States. Our establishment of the Provisional Government and our declaration of war against Britain and the United States will, in the future, once the offensive begins, strengthen the conviction of this faction. Britain and the United States say that the purpose of this war is to uphold democracy, but they do not recognize India's freedom. Japan is fighting for justice and has recognized the independence of Burma and the Philippines. This time, it has further recognized the Provisional Government of India. The truth is now obvious. I believe it will have a great impact on the Chongqing side. However, if Britain forever holds the dominance of India, then the Chongqing side will not be able to realize the futility of resistance and will still look forward to opening the Burma Road to achieve final victory. But once the Indian National Army liberates the provinces of Bengal and Assam in India, then Chongqing's desire for the opening of the Burma Road will be completely hopeless, and the transportation expenses through Assam will also be cut off. The Chongqing regime may clearly realize the futility of resistance. What I don't care about now is an appeal to the Chongqing side, because the Chongqing side has not yet reflected on the future complete liberation of the provinces of Bengal and Assam. I must make an appeal to the Chongqing regime. (Question) What is the morale of the National Army? (Answer) According to a third party who is connected with the National Army, the National Army has made great progress in the past few months. All the soldiers are more and more enthusiastic under the banner of "Go to Delhi". In the future, the National Army will not retreat, only advance or die in battle.</p>

<h3>Anniversary of the South Pacific Naval Battle; Japanese Lieutenant Commander Discusses Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) — October 26th marks the first anniversary of the "South Pacific Naval Battle," that is, the day the Japanese and American fleets encountered each other in the northern waters of the Santa Cruz Islands in the South Pacific, staging an unparalleled sea battle. On that single day, the U.S. fleet suffered losses including three aircraft carriers, one battleship, three cruisers, one destroyer, three ships of unknown type, and over 200 aircraft. In addition, one destroyer was heavily damaged. The scale of the Japanese military's achievements can be described as unprecedented. From this battle onward, the enemy fleet had no choice but to change its operational policy from fleet decisive battle doctrine to base advancement doctrine. The following is a recollection of the situation a year ago from a certain lieutenant commander of a certain ship who participated in the battle: "The South Pacific Naval Battle was the largest-scale naval battle involving enemy fleets with multiple aircraft carrier groups, responding to the Guadalcanal Island operation, and engaging the Japanese fleet on a large scale several times. The enemy occupied Guadalcanal Island in early August of last year, and unwilling to accept the heavy blows suffered in the first and second Solomon Sea battles, and in order to support the landing forces on Guadalcanal Island, gradually concentrated its naval forces, creating a situation of uncertainty around the Solomon Islands for about two months. The enemy, in order to lure the fleet into its sphere of influence, never left the range of its aircraft's capabilities. The South Pacific Naval Battle was a trap to lure us in, secretly measuring our offensive and implementing a lightning-fast attack. As a result of this battle, the enemy's forces were greatly weakened. In addition to losing several aircraft carriers, other losses were also significant. Therefore, afterward, in that area, they had no choice but to change the maritime operational doctrine of the fleet to a base advancement doctrine. The enemy fleet's movements had been anticipated by the Japanese side, so reconnaissance aircraft were dispatched at dawn that day to detect a large enemy fleet heading north from the west of the Santa Cruz Islands. Aerial attack units were immediately dispatched and an aerial alert network was set up. As soon as the deployment was completed, a large formation of enemy carrier-based aircraft appeared over the Japanese fleet, and the heroic battle began. Two Japanese aircraft carriers and one cruiser were damaged as a result. However, looking at the enemy side, the ships that were attacked by the Japanese military's aerial attack units at the risk of their lives and sunk were three aircraft carriers, one battleship, three cruisers, and 200 aircraft were shot down. The scale of the results was truly unprecedented. Due to the characteristics of the attack and defense capabilities of aircraft carriers, the time when the aircraft they carry are on the ship is the time of maximum attack power, but the defense power is weakest when the aircraft on the ship have not yet fully taken off and an enemy bomb hits, causing multiple bombs to explode. Conversely, once all the aircraft have taken off, the defense power immediately becomes the best. This is different from general warships, so if the enemy is detected early, the attack and defense power will be reversed, and this is the key to victory or defeat. The reason why the Japanese side won the South Pacific Sea Battle and suffered the least losses was because the enemy fleet was discovered earlier, and we were able to launch a preemptive strike. The great achievements that the Japanese soldiers obtained in this naval battle with their lives are etched in the hearts of all the people and will never be forgotten. In this battle, the Japanese soldiers broke through the enemy's iron barrel defense formation, drove their beloved aircraft in hand-to-hand combat, and some detonated their aircraft after launching torpedoes at the enemy aircraft carrier. Some drove their dive bombers into the enemy aircraft carrier, and then crashed directly into the enemy escort ship, causing it to catch fire. There was also a heroic anecdote in which a gunner measuring the angle of elevation on an aircraft carrier suffered severe injuries to both hands during combat, and continued to engage in artillery combat with the handle of the ruler in his mouth. Such heroic anecdotes are too numerous to mention. This unforgettable South Pacific Naval Battle has passed a year ago, and the overall situation of the war has become more serious than before. Therefore, I hope that the people in the rear will not forget the importance of this naval battle, and that all will rise up and rush to the war."</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Position on Various Islands in the South Pacific Becomes More Solid; U.S. Admits to Expecting Long and Arduous War</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) — General Barbey, Commander of the Anti-Axis Forces in the Southwest Pacific, stated: "The U.S. military will face a difficult and lengthy war in the Pacific. Americans have not yet damaged the Japanese military's vitality. If U.S. forces advance and make contact, the Japanese military will become even more tenacious. The main difficulty for the Americans is that the Japanese military has advanced to its current position, and the Americans must push them back. Future operations against Japan will likely be amphibious in nature, as the Japanese military has established solid positions on a large number of islands. If these islands cannot be occupied, it seems impossible to drive them back. The Americans have their own operational plans. However, an event that should be noted is that when we approach the Japanese military, the Japanese military's resistance will increase."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) — According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval aircraft launched a surprise attack on the enemy's Woodlark Island and the Trobriand Islands in New Britain early on the 23rd.

<h3>Fighting Reaches Its Peak on the Lower Dnieper Front; Germans Announce Abandonment of Melitopol</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) — A communique released by the German Headquarters on the 24th stated: "After fighting in the city of Melitopol for several days, the German army withdrew from the city to the western outskirts on the night of the 21st to the 22nd."</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) — A German High Command report stated: "The major offensive and defensive battles at the focal points on the central and southern routes of the Eastern Front have reached a particularly intense stage yesterday. Several Soviet divisions launched an offensive on a narrow front from south of Melitopol to southeast of Rongpuluki. They were repelled and suffered heavy losses. Several places in the German positions were dented and then quickly filled in. In Dniprodzerzhynsk (southeast of Kryvyi Rih), the enemy attacked from both sides under cover of heavy fog, establishing several bridgeheads on the west bank of the Dnieper. At the breakthrough point southeast of Kryvyi Rih, the enemy launched a fierce attack on the German defense line. The German army retaliated with a counterattack. The enemy has intensified its breakthrough offensive in Kryvyi Rih, and fierce battles are currently underway. There are also fierce battles west of Smolensk. The enemy's attempts to break through were thwarted by the heroic resistance of the German army, and the German army recovered its temporarily lost positions during the counterattack. Several small groups of enemy troops were annihilated. In the remaining battle areas on the Eastern Front, there were only local engagements. In the past two days, the Soviet army has lost a total of 282 tanks between the Sea of Azov and Kryvyi Rih."</p>
<p>The Staircase-Shaped Line of Defense is Impregnable</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) — A report from the German News Agency stated: "On Saturday and Sunday, the Soviet army continued to attack at the key points on the Eastern Front, but failed to achieve decisive results. The German army once again achieved a complete defensive victory along the entire line. On Saturday and Sunday, the Soviet army only pushed back the German front line by a few kilometers in a few places. But generally speaking, the enemy's offensives were all blocked by the deep and long staircase-shaped defensive system of the German army. The enemy was repelled everywhere and was unable to break through the German positions anywhere. Between the Sea of Azov and the Dnieper bend, the Soviet army launched an offensive along a wide front. Its main force was concentrated in the northern and southern areas of Melitopol. In the fierce battles throughout the day, the Soviet army's offensives were all repelled by the German grenadiers. After being held by the German defending forces for several days, the ruined town of Melitopol was evacuated that afternoon. The Soviet army's offensive against the German fan-shaped positions on the western outskirts of the town collapsed, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. North of Melitopol, German mountain troops gained and held a position during a counterattack. The Soviet army's repeated offensives were unsuccessful."</p>
<p>German Battlefield Results North and South of Kyiv</p>
<p>"At the gap northwest of Dniprodzerzhynsk, the Soviet army launched an offensive along the entire line with newly arrived infantry and tank divisions, targeting the flanks of the German army and the German positions in front of Kryvyi Rih. The German grenadiers in front of Kryvyi Rih were forced to withdraw their lines westward under the strong pressure of several groups of Soviet tanks. But at the same time, the German flanks continued to defend successfully. The Soviet army lost a total of 78 tanks in one area on Saturday and Sunday. North of Kyiv, German infantry and tank units repelled the Soviet army eastward in a courageous attack and seized a large batch of war spoils. More than 1,000 prisoners of war fell into German hands. The Soviet army's offensive to break into the German positions in the central Dnieper was blocked by the resolute defense of the German infantry. On the road between Smolensk and Orsha, the German defending forces also won a great victory on the third day of the defensive battle. The Soviet army had reinforced its artillery units and joined the battle with several teams of tanks and motorized infantry under the cover of heavy fog. The German army had to temporarily withdraw to the front of its positions in order to allow the German artillery units to fully exert their defensive power. After several hours of fierce fighting, the German grenadiers won a great victory, causing the Soviet army to retreat to its original positions. Currently, only local battles are occurring in the northern part of the Eastern Front south of Lake Ladoga. That afternoon, the Soviet army broke into the German positions, but the gap was immediately sealed off during the German counterattack. Four Soviet tanks fell into German hands, while another eleven were disabled. Stanbury Island"</p>

<h3>German Forces Build Strong Positions in the Balkans, Focusing on the Entire Black Sea Coast</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Reuters reports: Field Marshal Rommel, commander of German forces in northern Italy, is building positions along the Balkan coast to prevent Soviet and Anglo-American forces from invading the Balkans, while also actively strengthening existing positions. However, it is generally observed that the anti-Axis forces' invasion routes into the Balkans are, on the one hand, across the Adriatic Sea, which is controlled by British forces, landing in Albania; and on the other hand, by Soviet forces landing on the eastern coast of the Balkans from the Black Sea. However, Field Marshal Rommel believes that the ongoing Moscow Conference is aimed at coordinating simultaneous operations by British, American, and Soviet forces. According to Swedish press reports, German forces are currently mobilizing labor and soldiers from morning to night to construct solid fortifications and trenches, airfields, and install long-range artillery along the entire Black Sea coast from Odessa to the Turkish border. Citizens of various European countries are also participating in this work. Another Swedish newspaper also stated that the situation in the Balkans is becoming increasingly tense.</p>
<p>He recently issued a warning regarding the fact that the anti-Axis forces are too dispersed on various battlefronts around the world, saying that the reserves of British and American forces in the Mediterranean are not inexhaustible, and using these forces on overly broad deployment lines poses a danger to military operations in this region. Furthermore, British forces cannot simultaneously launch several large-scale offensives on various fronts with sufficient forces. The overuse of anti-Axis military power reduces its strength. These remarks by the British military commentator were made in response to the foolishness of starting combat in Burma. The action in Burma is "unwise" because it affects operations in the Mediterranean. He did not say that if the anti-Axis forces can occupy Burma at the cost of weakening the Mediterranean forces, it would be a losing proposition.</p>

Tamu is located upstream of the Naf River, 40 kilometers from Maungdaw, and is the enemy's front-line base. Since attempting to counterattack Burma, the enemy has actively prepared military supplies and built barracks in the Naf River upstream area centered on Tamu in preparation for an offensive.

<h3>Minister Mei Talks to Reporters About Promoting Government Orders</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Minister of the Interior Mei Siping met with Chinese and Japanese reporters in the capital at the department's auditorium at 3 p.m. on the 24th. More than twenty reporters attended. This was Minister Mei's first meeting with the press since taking office. Minister Mei answered each question raised by the reporters one by one. The following is a summary: Question (1): The success of a nation's politics depends on whether government orders are smoothly implemented. What are the Minister's thoughts on this? (Answer): I have been studying this issue for more than ten years. When I was a university professor, I taught administrative law. Later, as a local official, I actually dealt with this issue, so I attach great importance to it. China has a history of thousands of years. In the past, it was difficult to promote government orders locally. There was no such thing as internal education before the Republic of China. The biggest reason was that local officials had too little power. Taking the county magistrate as an example, not only was his position low and his powers limited, but his funds were also insufficient. This had a great impact on the implementation of government orders. I believe that in order to promote government orders and put national politics on the right track, we must improve the status of local officials and increase county finances. I am currently considering a plan and intend to inspect the county administrations in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places in a month to provide suggestions for improvement. Question: What new plans do you have for promoting the Baojia system? (Answer): The Ministry of the Interior has established a Baojia Promotion Committee to promote the Baojia system. In September of this year, after careful discussion by the former Minister Chen and others, it was decided to expand the organization of the Baojia Committee and draft a plan. The principles have been approved, and the Social Welfare Department of the New People's Movement and the Central Party Headquarters will participate. From now on, the Baojia Promotion Committee will be responsible for matters related to promoting mass movements. The same applies to all regions. (Question) Are there any new plans for promoting county administration nationwide in the future? (Answer) The focus of promoting county administration should be on both the Baojia and the police. The former is the organization of the people, and the latter is related to local security. Both have close links with county administration. In the future, the promotion of administrative work will start from these two aspects and strive to promote it so that county administration nationwide can be promoted smoothly.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Side Acknowledges Difficult Operations in Italy, Mountain Offensive Suffers Setback</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a communiqué issued by General Alexander's anti-Axis 15th Army Group in Italy: All roads lead to Rome, but unfortunately, these roads are all mined with landmines and all bridges have been blown up. Alexander's forces have experienced the difficulties of fighting in Italy. It is estimated that there are 35 to 40 divisions of strong German forces in Italy and the Balkans, so progress is naturally not rapid.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After a tour from Tunis, Malta, Sardinia and Naples, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. declared in Algiers: Americans are too optimistic. When we look at the towering Mount Volturno Valley and its tendency to increase in altitude to the north, we feel that we must continue to engage in arduous mountain warfare. This is Morgenthau's feeling about the Italian battlefield. He also said: Before we reach Rome, there will be a period of hard and bloody fighting. When I return to the United States, I will tell the American people that we still have difficult work ahead of us. This may be beneficial to everyone, because the sooner Americans learn the truth, the better.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A German news agency reports: On Saturday, British and American forces once again launched attempts to break through at various focal points on the southern Italian front with powerful forces. The British and American forces were met with intensified German defenses everywhere. The characteristic of the German defense was the reinforcement of heavy artillery and the participation of mobile artillery units in the battle. The mobile artillery units used 8.8 cm caliber guns and took joint action with infantry assault teams. This cooperation caused heavy losses to the British and American forces in Ganbochilo in the Apennine Mountains on Saturday. A large number of enemy "Xu Men" tanks were destroyed, and the attacking enemy forces were repelled and routed. Four anti-Axis forces attempted to use mule columns to control the impassable wilderness mountains north of Piedmont. This flanking encirclement attempt was detected by the German forces in time and suppressed with accurate artillery fire. Between Piedmont and the upper reaches of the Volturno River, the British and American forces launched two offensives on the same [blank] scale, after large-scale artillery preparations, but were soon hindered by the German artillery and completely defeated by the German counter-attack. The roar of the [blank] army's heavy artillery prevented the British and American material preparation teams from entering the combat area. As a result, the German army finally annihilated or captured most of the U.S. military sub-units. West of the upper reaches of the Volturno River, British and American forces launched repeated sporadic offensives, [blank] trying to split the German defenses, but the enemy's attacks were repelled everywhere. The main German forces launched two powerful counter-attacks at Rocheda and Sbalanies, making it clear [blank] the effectiveness of the German resistance at the northern exit of the Campania Plain. In this battle, German [blank] infantry captured many prisoners of war and seized a large number of light and heavy infantry weapons [blank] trophies, which shows the heavy price paid by the British and American forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to official sources: A strong German bomber formation violently attacked the port facilities of Naples last night, as well as anti-Axis transport ships docked at the harbor. The enemy's losses are not yet known.</p>
<h3>Foreign Envoys to Italy Return to Venice</h3>
<p>Venice, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Republican Fascist government has designated Venice as the residence for foreign envoys. Most of the [blank] envoys from various countries have [blank] stationed in the city. The ambassador of [blank] has arrived. The ambassadors of Bulgaria and Hungary will also arrive. A delegation from the Japanese Embassy has moved here. Envoys from Slovakia and Croatia have also moved here, but the Thai envoy has gone to [blank]'s Meiqi.</p>
<h3>U.S. Submarine Sinks in Pacific</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy Department announced on the 24th: "The submarine USS Dorado did not return to base as scheduled and has [blank] sacrificed in the Pacific. The submarine was launched in May 1942.</p>
<h3>German Submarine Commander Establishes Extraordinary Merits</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A German news agency reports: On Sunday, the German leader personally presented the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Diamonds to [blank] Naval Lieutenant Commander Ludsdehai, a German submarine commander. Russ is the first person to receive this diamond award. Lieutenant Commander Russ recently returned to Germany after completing fifteen long-range expeditions. The length of time he was on expeditions has set a new record among independently operating submarines. Admiral [blank] Nitz also issued an order, highly praising the 30-year-old lieutenant commander.</p>
<h3>German Light Warships in Black Sea Attack Anapa Port at Night</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to German military authorities, a night raid on Anapa Port on the eastern shore of the Black Sea shelled anti-Axis ships. Enemy ships in the middle of the night on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Moscow Conference Reaches Important Stage</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Reuters special correspondent Kim Harro reported from Moscow last night that the Moscow Conference has entered its most important phase. Experts from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union held their first discussion of complex issues from 9 PM until 2 AM the next morning before adjourning.</p>
<p>Moscow, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) – U.S. Secretary of State Hull, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held their sixth meeting at the Guest House here at 4 PM on the 24th.</p>
<p>Invasion of Western Europe Must Wait</p>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) Washington dispatch: The order for U.S. General Marshall to be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the forces invading Western Europe, which was originally scheduled to be announced on October 25th, has now been postponed. The "Army and Navy Records Report" stated that General Marshall will remain in Washington until the beginning of next year. This newspaper, which is close to the U.S. Department of the Army, indicates that the plan for the anti-Axis forces to land in the Netherlands or France will not be implemented until the spring or summer of 1944 at the earliest. The New York correspondent of the "Swedish Daily News" stated that the opening of a second front cannot be realized in the short term. The war on the Eastern Front has completely misguided the United States' estimates. The United States believed last winter that after another year of war, the strength of Germany and the Soviet Union would be exhausted. In this case, the anti-Axis forces could not only land in Europe, but also easily resolve European affairs without being constrained by the Soviet Union. However, in fact, the Soviet army's summer offensive has shattered the wishful thinking of the United Kingdom and the United States, and the United States is worried about the progress of the Moscow Conference due to its current unfavorable position.</p>
<h3>Fundamental Issues of Enhancing War Power</h3>
<p>What are the contents of enhancing our war power under the decisive battle? How should we deal with it? The following items are described in detail. However, the problem is extremely profound and very complicated. The center of this problem is the aircraft industry. However, the war power enhancement problem is not only related to this, but also related to the entire war economy. It is a fundamental issue of the total war of the entire national structure for carrying out the war and the decisive battle. In view of the complexity and importance of this problem, we intend to put forward some fundamental items at the beginning for clear examination.</p>
<p>First, enhancing the war power in the current decisive battle stage must embrace the principle of aviation aircraft first. The war power enhancement up to now has been the simultaneous advancement of the five major industries of steel, coal, light metals, ships, and aircraft. Placing an ultra-emphasis on these five major industries is based on what is called ultra-emphasisism. Before this, no specific industry was designated, but was based on what is called emphasisism as a prerequisite. However, today, planar ultra-emphasisism is not allowed. The importance of the five major industries has not diminished in the slightest at present. In particular, enhancing shipbuilding capacity is indeed an important task that we must emphasize. However, the importance of the five major industries and the parallel establishment of other important industries based on them, and granting them so-called special cases and prioritized production enhancement methods, are things from before the stage when the decisive battle in aviation occurred one after another.</p>
<p>Of course, administrative special cases should be extended to all important industries. However, the expansion of special cases is not just an administrative reform. The government's "National Strength Enhancement Measures," which were decided upon the other day, aim to decisively transform the entire administrative operation into a decisive battle mode. The war power enhancement method adapted to this stage must be based on aircraft production as the apex, and on the basis of the aircraft industry series arrangement, establish a three-dimensional situation of key industries. What we first want to emphasize is this point. In this sense, this "National Structure Enhancement Measures" should aim at the rapid enhancement of military production (especially the rapid expansion of aviation war power).</p>
<p>Second, what is most necessary for current war power enhancement is the construction of aircraft and ships, so the purpose must be to establish a mass production style. Of course, in order to realize rapid increase in production, where are the bottlenecks for increasing production, it is necessary to accurately review the actual situation, and to bravely open up this bottleneck. For the sake of opening up the bottleneck, administrative inspection is indeed extremely urgent, and the utilization of domestic resources is also necessary. Therefore, the current production increase measures are nothing more than implementing measures to overcome this urgent bottleneck. But our enemies are the United Kingdom and the United States. Whether it is one aircraft or one ship, they should all be produced as soon as possible. However, can we overwhelm the enemy's "quantity" by gradually opening up the ordinary production increase bottleneck? It is essential to think deeply about this point. A few thousand aircraft and tens of thousands of tons three months later are fundamentally more important than tens of thousands of aircraft and millions of tons one year later.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is necessary not only to open up the so-called bottleneck, but also to overcome all obstacles and establish a mass production style. However, this matter requires a certain period of time. If the time is lost, the establishment of a mass production style is impossible. No, what is more important is that it cannot keep up with the time of the decisive battle. Just as the supply war in the Southwest Pacific is becoming increasingly profound, we cannot help but keenly feel that the key point of the current war power enhancement is to rapidly shift to a mass production system.</p>
<p>Then, is the establishment of the aircraft first principle an easy task? Also, is the realization of a mass production system easy? No. Under today's decisive battle economy, it is not easy to solve these two problems. Therefore, industrialists must reflect more deeply; at the same time, it is indispensable to establish a genuine decisive battle administration. This problem can only be solved by a system where all the people are united with the spirit of determination and made to act as a force in the decisive battle, and with the economic system of the decisive battle standing on the basis of its total strength.</p>
<h3>Japan Enhancing Production Power</h3>
<p>That is, we do not regard the war power enhancement problem under the current situation as a simple war power enhancement problem, but also believe that it is an inseparable problem from strengthening the domestic structure. This is the third point we want to emphasize.</p>
<p>The government has already clarified in the aforementioned "National Structure Enhancement Measures" the gist of "seeking to more clearly express the national nature of important enterprises in management, and establishing various measures such as the production responsibility system." However, the content of the production responsibility system mentioned here must be reviewed in conjunction with the concretization of the "measures" in order to be sufficient.</p>
<p>However, the implementation of the production responsibility system does not change the main point of view of the war power enhancement described above. The saying "clearly expressing the national nature of important enterprises in management" is synonymous with the reflection of the aforementioned industrialists. Because for the sake of realizing "mass production," it should first be implemented in the aircraft industry.</p>
<p>Requirements for Enhancing War Power</p>
<p>The requirements for enhancing war power to cope with the decisive battle stage further require the advancement of decisive battle administration. In response to this requirement, in order to thoroughly strengthen the domestic defense situation and to ensure this, the government has decided on the "National Structure Enhancement Measures" with extraordinary determination, and based on this, it plans to transform administrative operations into decisive battle mode. We intend to review the process of the decisive battle administration to date in order to clarify the necessity of this transformation of administrative operations into decisive battle mode.</p>
<p>Development of Production Administration</p>
<p>With the expansion of the war situation, the wartime planned economy has also become increasingly advanced. Based on the will of the state, economic control has been continuously strengthened. However, the responsible officials differ depending on the industrial sector, and this phenomenon also exists within the same sector. For example, materials are related to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, labor is under the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and funds and economic relations are under the Ministry of Finance. The so-called bureaucratic control, where the supervisory departments do not interact with each other, has already exposed the drawbacks of territorialism. Therefore, the economic control that should have ensured planned production has hindered the enhancement of production, deviating from its original intention. Thus, the reform of production administration has long been a pending matter. The control association method based on the Important Industry Group Ordinance is a product of self-criticism of bureaucratic control, and the theory of establishing a Ministry of Military Affairs, which emerged in the private sector at the Central Cooperation Conference of the Great Japan Political Association last autumn, is one of its manifestations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the war situation entered a new stage of continuous and fierce decisive battles in the second half of last year. In order to destroy the total counterattack of the United Kingdom and the United States, rapid and epoch-making production enhancement has become an urgent issue. With the development of this objective situation, production administration also developed rapidly, with the end of last year as an opportunity, and the character of the decisive battle became increasingly strong.</p>
<p>The first was the decision of the Cabinet meeting on November 27 last year to establish a temporary production enhancement committee. The purpose of this measure was to avoid the so-called reform of administrative institutions and to unify industrial administration through artful operation. Secondly, the Wartime Administrative Special Cases Law and the Permission and Approval Temporary Measures Law were also established in the 81st session of the Diet. Furthermore, in the Cabinet meeting on March 18, the special cases of wartime administrative power and the cabinet advisory system, the wartime economic consultation council system, and the administrative inspection envoy system, which are internally and externally related to the two aforementioned laws, were decided, and local administrative consultation councils were also created, adding epoch-making reforms to the operation of production administration.</p>
<p>Due to the above-mentioned wartime administrative emergency legislation, departmentalism has been curbed, and there is no doubt that the momentum of moving towards comprehensive unification of industrial administration has been established. Due to the exercise of the Prime Minister's instruction authority, the past disputes among the responsible government offices regarding production enhancement and the conflicts of opinions among the ministries have been resolved, and the drawbacks of the bureaucratic control that were criticized in the past have also been corrected.</p>
<p>Also. The Wartime Administrative Joint Authority Special Cases clearly stipulate that steel, coal, light metals, aircraft, and ships are the five major key industries (Article 1). The urgent production increase target at the decisive battle stage is clearly declared on the surface. In order to quickly and effectively transform various production factors with certain limitations, such as materials, labor, funds, and power, into war power, it is extremely natural to stop the past method of all-round - and thus also scattered - production expansion, and the emphasis on key production has therefore been significantly emphasized.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the cabinet advisory system mobilizes the knowledge and experience of private sector experts to enhance the production of the five major key industries; the advisors' insights and research will be used as various policies of the government. As for the inspection system, State Minister Suzuki's investigation of the iron and steel industry in the Kyoto area in May, Cabinet Advisor Fujiwara's investigation of the iron and steel industry and coal mining industry in the Northeast and Hokkaido regions in July, and Advisor Fujiwara's investigation of the aviation aircraft industry in late September have been conducted on-site three times, examining how material mobilization plans and other important policies penetrate lower-level organizations and are concretized, as well as discovering where production bottlenecks exist. Based on the principle of on-site decision-making, it has achieved great results in reforming production administration and grasping the actual situation of production. In particular, Advisor Fujiwara's inspection has shown his many years of experience and capabilities in the private sector, and has achieved achievements in many aspects, such as opening up production bottlenecks, improving production efficiency, and changing production conditions, and in the renovation of production technology.</p>
<p>Fundamental Reform of Production Administration</p>
<p>In response to key production, the Cooperation Council for the private sector cooperation system was established. As everyone knows, aircraft and shipbuilding are comprehensive industries, and they can only develop smoothly on the basis of expanding and arranging all related industries such as parts and raw materials. Moreover, if raw material departments such as steel, coal, and light metals cannot reliably obtain materials and equipment, it is difficult to hope for rapid production increase. Therefore, the premise of production enhancement centered on the five major key industries is naturally organic cooperation with related industries. In this sense, the Army Aviation Industry Association was established in the aircraft industry in November last year, establishing a cooperation system that comprehensively manages aircraft, engines, equipment, materials, and parts. As for the other four major key industries of steel, coal, light metals, and ships, the "Cooperation Council" composed of closely related industries was organized on March 25 through the mediation of the "Key Production Association", with the control associations of the four industries as the core. The controlling organizations of each cooperating industry also concluded a supply agreement for products with the controlling organizations of the key industries, completing the system for cooperation to promote key production.</p>
<p>In order to complete the production enhancement of the above-mentioned key military supplies, the improvement of production administration and the corresponding private sector cooperation system are gradually being arranged, but it cannot be said that this is all that is required to meet the decisive battle characterization of production administration required at the decisive battle stage. As explained in the above paragraphs, the adjustment of related industries for the sake of completing ultra-key production is a major problem. Vehicles, machine tools for aircraft, etc., can certainly adapt to actual needs and decide on measures based on the five major key industries, but if production administration is not fundamentally reformed, or if the guidance of the war economy is not thoroughly reviewed, then the key industries that are expanded to meet actual needs will inevitably become an "added budget" type of addition, thereby reducing the significance of key production, and there is a great risk of falling back into a list-like, planar production enhancement method.</p>
<p>Therefore, establishing a true ultra-key production system and fundamentally reforming the production administration that promotes this system is essential. Therefore, due to the decision on the "National Structure Enhancement Measures," we have reached an epoch-making stage. (From "Allied World Report," Volume 24, Issue 4)</p>

<h3>Grain Control Committee Actively Deploys Rice Purchase Work and Establishes Offices in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: In order to actively carry out the work of purchasing rice, the Rice Control Committee, since its establishment, has designated major rice-producing areas in accordance with the outline, established local rice purchasing trade associations, registered and reviewed local purchasing merchants with rich experience in grain as preparatory committee members. They are responsible for organizing the association and centralizing the unified purchase of rice. In addition to convening a general meeting of the preparatory committee members on the 19th of this month, explaining the meaning of this mission to control rice and instructing them to cooperate in purchasing rice steps, in order to strengthen the organization and expand the task of guiding rice purchases, it has specially divided areas in Wuhu, Yikou, Taixian, Yangzhou, Songjiang, Kunshan, Changshu, Suzhou, Wujiang, Jiaxing, Zhoushi, Changzhou, Danyang, Jintan, Tongzhou, Nanjing, Huzhou, Yixing, Wuxi, and Zhenjiang and other 20 districts, established offices and appointed directors and deputy directors to supervise local purchasing merchants to purchase rice, and handle rice movement certificates and facilitate them, and forward the application for issuing rice transportation passports and other matters. It is learned that the association recently convened a meeting of directors and deputy directors of local offices to discuss and instruct the future rice purchase policy and the tasks that should be urged and promoted. The directors and deputy directors of the various local offices have gone to various districts to actively prepare for the establishment of their offices.</p>
<h3>Implementation Guidelines for Rice Purchase in Three Provinces</h3>
<p>The Rice Control Committee is actively carrying out the work of purchasing rice. Its related matters are implemented in accordance with the "Outline of the Rice Purchase Plan for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces in the 32nd Year of the Republic of China" decided by the Materials Control Review Committee. The implementation guidelines are formulated as follows:</p>
<p>Purchase Subordinate Organizations</p>
<p>When implementing the purchase, the main japonica rice producing areas and the main indica rice producing areas are separated. The former is called Area A, and the latter is called Area B. The lower-level organizations of the Rice Control Committee are separately formed by those responsible for purchasing in Area A and those responsible for purchasing in Area B. The lower-level organization responsible for purchasing by the Japanese side mainly uses the organization of the Central China Rice Grain Purchase Association, and the lower-level organization responsible for purchasing by the Chinese side is composed of rice merchants and uses their powerful trade associations. The Grain Control Committee is responsible for implementing the purchase under the control of the Commercial Control Committee, so it must guide and supervise its lower-level organizations so that all purchased rice is uniformly distributed by the Grain Control Committee in accordance with the Outline of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Rice Purchase Plan.</p>
<p>Quantity Collected in Area A</p>
<p>Collection guidelines for Area A: The rice collection organization, the Japanese Central China Rice Grain Purchase Association, must be quickly formed, and the Chinese purchasing organization must be quickly prepared. Both will start purchasing on September 20. It is expected that the amount collected in each area is 310,000 tons in the area governed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and 40,000 tons in the area governed by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. As for the collection method, necessary registration and movement control are implemented in Area A. In the clearing areas implemented in the area, the main method is to adopt a quota system, and other areas will adopt a purchase system.</p>
<p>Quantity Collected in Area B</p>
<p>Collection Organization: Area B is responsible for collection by the Chinese Rice Grain Trade Association. It is expected that the collection area will include five areas in northern Anhui, southern Anhui, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Huzhou, collecting a total of 280,000 tons. Collection Method: Area B implements movement control. In principle, it is registered, and a purchase system is implemented for collection. In order to implement these two items, it is sequentially submitted to the government for promulgation of corresponding control regulations, and the local administrative organs are ordered to assist the collection in terms of promoting and guarding related controls.</p>
<p>Purchase Price Determination</p>
<p>It has been decided by the Grain Control Committee. Based on the variety and other conditions for determining the price, such as the balance of important agricultural products, the necessary procedures shall be followed. Once the price is determined, it will not be changed in principle for one year.

<h3>Shanghai Fu Deaf-Mute School Cultivates Talent for the Deaf and Mute</h3>
<p>Hard struggle</p>
<p>The upper-level organization of the Shanghai Fu Deaf-Mute School is the board of directors, which is the same as the Shanghai Blind Children's School. Mr. Wang Shuxian, who is enthusiastic about charity, especially the education of disabled children, serves as the chairman of the board. Principal Wang also serves as the director of education, with a total of six full-time teachers, four women and two men. Two of them are deaf-mutes, and the rest are healthy and familiar young people. They have all received special normal school education and training, are rich in educational experience, especially sympathize with the deaf-mutes, and are willing to sacrifice themselves and take the education of deaf-mute children as a lifelong career. Seeing their warm and eager attitude towards teaching children, I can't help but feel a sense of admiration and gratitude.</p>
<p>Although the history of Fu Deaf-Mute School is not very long, due to the hard work and serious work of leaders and teachers, it has shown considerable brilliant achievements in the past ten years. According to Principal Wang, the school has graduated approximately 300 students in the past. At least 60% of them have obtained a job and are happy in their job. The remaining 30% have gone on to further education or specialized in art. Before the war, such as the Commercial Press, Zhonghua, and the world's various book printing houses, all had graduates from the school working there. Especially those serving in the studio of famous engraving master Xiaojiang. It is said that Mr. Wang Mingchuan, who is now the deputy director of the Art Department of China United Film Company, also created a lot of advertising paintings. There are also many graduates who are committed to promoting deaf-mute education. Hu Huiqing and Lu Yinglian are in the alma mater. Jiang Jinxiu is in the Hankou Deaf-Mute School, and there are also many in the various deaf-mute schools in Shanghai. Among them, Li Shiqing, the principal of Guangzhen Deaf-Mute School and the director of academic affairs of Zhonghua Deaf-Mute School, and Chen Zugeng of Huxi Deaf-Mute School, are particularly outstanding people, and Principal Han constantly praises them.</p>
<p>It is precisely because of the educational achievements of Shanghai Fu Deaf-Mute School that not only ordinary people in this city send their deaf-mute children to study, but also students from other places have heard the news with joy and come from afar. Especially because it tries its best to arrange for deaf-mute children who are suffering and helpless, and also bears the cost of their food and clothing, and nurtures them to become useful talents in society. Therefore, various charity organizations have sent deaf-mute children to request education. There are now six children from the Charity Organization Joint Disaster Relief Zeng Yangji Yuan, two from the Xinde Society, two from the Children's Protection Association, and those sent by the Children's Protection Section of the First District Government. It can be seen the extent to which the school is needed by society.</p>
<p>Future prospects</p>
<p>According to the survey statistics of Fu Deaf-Mute School, there are about 100 deaf-mutes per 100,000 people in China. With a population of 400 million, there are 400,000 people, of which at least 100,000 are school-age children. However, there are only 20 deaf-mute schools in the country, and there are no more than 100 specialized teachers. The number of deaf and dumb students is less than 1,000. It can be seen that more than 90% of deaf and mute school-age children are still out of school, and the lack of teachers is even more needless to say. This is such a serious phenomenon. Shanghai is the most developed place for deaf-mute education in the country. The number of schools accounts for one-third of the country's total, reaching as many as seven, but most of them are very small in scale, and the number of students enrolled is small, only a dozen or dozens of people. The larger ones are only dozens of people. It goes without saying that it is not enough to meet the actual needs of society. Moreover, like the Shanghai Fu Deaf-Mute School, which has a certain scale and achievements, it is still in extreme difficulty. There is no way to develop.</p>
<p>Shanghai Fu Deaf-Mute School has no special funds. All expenditures depend on the income from tuition fees. The former Public Works Bureau provided a slight subsidy every year, but it was far from enough. It only relied on donations from the school board and enthusiastic people, but the school has never advocated raising donations from outside on a large scale. Therefore, it is always in financial straits. The school's application to the Shanghai Bu Bing Charity Relief Association for a subsidy stated its plight: "... There is no way to raise funds, and all avenues have been exhausted. It has been operating in a miserable state for seventeen years. If it is allowed to stagnate, then the past efforts will all be in vain, and deaf-mute children will all lose their education? Submersion is unbearable." Committee member Li Wenjie of the association went to investigate and confirmed that it was true. Later, the regular meeting decided to subsidize 3,000 yuan at a time. The school's expenses were originally not that large. The monthly salary of teachers and staff did not exceed 200 yuan. They had two bowls of porridge and one meal a day, and ate vegetarian food all year round. They were so poor that they were extremely poor. However, because they were teaching deaf-mute children, and because deaf-mute education required more equipment than ordinary education, the economic difficulties continued to increase. Principal Zhuo showed the school's budget for the semester from August of this year to January of next year. The income, including tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, accommodation fees, meal fees, and the 3,500 yuan subsidy from the First District Government, totaled 34,700 yuan. The expenditures, including water and electricity, rent, house donations, salaries, educational supplies fees, repairs, miscellaneous fees, additions, and meal fees, totaled 88,100 yuan (of which salaries were 8,040 yuan). The shortfall was as high as 53,400 yuan. This is something that needs to be helped by particularly enthusiastic people in society. According to Principal Wang, the school has three hopes: Raise funds, increase the number of free places, and provide relief for homeless people to create. Because deaf-mutes have no problems with their eyes and hands and have the conditions to work, they only need basic knowledge training to become useful talents for society and the country. It is not easy for deaf-mute children to understand when reading. They must be guided in many ways with facts and objects before they can slowly understand. Therefore, the school hopes to purchase specimens and instruments with the help of society, and then establish a library and research room to help teachers and students study. The school originally had a vocational department to train specialized technical talents. If society provides powerful assistance, even sewing machines needed for sewing courses can be purchased, so that they can be restored and expanded in a short period of time, and deaf-mute work laboratories can be added, and even factories can be created to increase productivity, eliminate deaf-mute illiteracy, and use human power to make up for natural defects, and can actively turn society into meaningful things for profiteers. (The End)</p>
<p>Economic Circle - Comments</p>
<h3>Economic Blood Vessels</h3>
<p>If finance can be likened to the blood of the economy, then transportation can undoubtedly be likened to the blood vessels of the economy. The function of blood vessels is to circulate blood in the human body. Otherwise, even if there is enough blood, it will not help the health of the human body. Whether the wartime economic system is sound or not depends not only on the existence of financial regulation, but also on the strength of transportation capacity. For example, to increase production, the problem of raw materials for production must be solved first. May I ask, if there are raw materials but no transportation, how can raw materials be transformed into finished products? To strengthen distribution, the source of materials must be solved first; May I ask, if there are materials but no transportation, how can materials meet the needs of consumers? In short, strengthening the transportation mechanism is the basic work to solve production and distribution. Otherwise, even if cotton is collected, it will still not restore the factory's vitality; even if rice and grain are collected, it will still not solve the hunger of the people. Then, wouldn't everything be empty words that do not help the facts?</p>
<p>However, "if a worker wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." If there is no sufficient transportation equipment to strengthen transportation, then transportation cannot be strengthened. Therefore, we once advocated large-scale shipbuilding and dredging of waterways to form a circular transportation dynamic from wooden boats to factories and from factories to wooden boats, so as to solve the two problems of exchanging materials and increasing production. Recently, Guangzhou, in response to shipbuilding in mainland Japan, is using local materials to build machine sailboats. The first and second ships have been launched, the third ship is under construction, and the fourth and fifth ships are being prepared for construction. This kind of continuous effort to use local materials to increase transportation equipment is really worthy of emulation by economic figures in Central China, especially the promotion of transportation and industrial authorities, in order to connect our economic blood vessels.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Special Committee Promulgates Regulations for the Movement of Flour Bran</h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has been handling the unified purchase and centralized distribution. There are some ambiguities regarding the method of movement and the certificate. Recently, the Flour and Wheat Transfer Committee has promulgated three regulations. The main points are as follows: For local movement, less than ten bags require a certificate from the local Sino-Japanese Trade Association or other office; For ten bags or more, in addition to the stipulated procedures, a certificate from the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee's office is also required. For movement between regions, it is necessary to have the necessary personnel from the local Flour and Wheat Special Committee's office and the Grain Bureau. In addition to the prescribed regulations, it is also necessary to have a permit from the Materials Permit Office.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Hot Money Flows to Shanghai - Authorities Seek to Suppress</h3>
<p>Tianjin in North China is equivalent to Shanghai in Central China. In the past, it was the only port for foreign trade. Commerce was prosperous and hot money was abundant. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War and the recovery of the Tianjin Concessions, the hot money that used to specialize in speculation and hoarding in the concession areas has gradually lost its room for activity under the strict control of the authorities. Up to now, Tianjin is managing the market and strictly prohibiting accumulation and restricting the free buying and selling of various major commodities, which is even stricter than Shanghai. Therefore, a large amount of hot money has nowhere to escape. In general, investors have to find ways to open up avenues for themselves to survive. Therefore, recently, Tianjin's hot money has been flowing to Shanghai, but detailed figures cannot be statistically determined. It is understood that relevant parties believe that the large-scale southward movement of Tianjin's hot money will have some impact on Shanghai's finance in the future.</p>
<h3>The Interior Pan Meeting at the End of the Month Changed to Today</h3>
<p>Money supply gradually relaxes, various industries are at peace</p>
<p>The end of the month for Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors is approaching in an instant. For the remittance and exchange of long-term credit loans from money shops, they have already contacted each other separately. For those business firms with good credit, each remittance and exchange shop, in order to regulate finance, has made appropriate accommodations to extend the term. The Shanghai Money Industry Association originally scheduled to hold a meeting for the internal pan at the end of the month yesterday (25th) (to decide the market price for the internal pan at the end of the month). It is now understood that the association has temporarily decided to convene a special meeting at 3 pm today (26th) to be particularly cautious and on the one hand, promote speculation and hoarding. Regarding the joint bank reserve, the colleagues will continue to handle it today. All member banks and shops may provide property as collateral and apply to the association's treasury for short-term cash loans due to legitimate business needs. After each bank and shop makes adjustments, they will fully maintain the legitimate development of various industries and remain stable. The money supply is even more relaxed than before. The interest rate on short-term loans is continued at 0.2 points, and the listed price is 1.2 points. Various industries should be able to get through this period safely.</p>
<h3>Paper Money and Aluminum Paper Association Holds Inaugural Meeting</h3>

<p>The price of cotton procurement is being secretly formulated. The cotton department is preparing to purchase on a large scale.</p>
<p>The cotton department of the Commercial and Trade Council has already decided on a specific plan to purchase cotton. However, the price set for the procurement in the past was too low. In order to encourage farmers to sell and cultivate cotton, it was decided to appropriately increase the price. The department is currently working with relevant personnel to secretly formulate the price, and it is expected to be announced soon. The cotton collection work for this year will also be launched on a large scale.</p>

Oil grains have also shown an upward trend due to rumors of favorable purchases, and prices have slightly increased.</p>

Among them, the prices of the first and middle factories, Qianmen and British goods are all high.</p>

<h3>Current Problems of the Commerce Control Council</h3>
<p>Since its establishment on March 16th, the Commerce Control Council has been in operation for seven months, actually controlling materials, establishing an autonomous control system for the Chinese economy, and gradually promoting all its work. The nature of the Commerce Control Council itself, its operational direction, and the necessity of further developing its advanced functions, along with its future trends, are all subjects of general public attention. Here is an overview of the various issues facing the Commerce Control Council.</p>
<p>Progress Since Establishment</p>
<p>The Commerce Control Council was born with the character of an autonomous material control organization. Its greatest goal is to suppress and stabilize material prices, stabilize people's livelihoods, enhance war power, and realize economic cooperation between China and Japan. However, recently some people have been critical of the Commerce Control Council. The main criticisms are as follows: Shortcomings of the Commerce Control Council itself. Insufficient cooperation from businesspeople. The relationship between the Commerce Control Council and relevant authorities. These will be elaborated below: Shortcomings of the Commerce Control Council itself</p>
<p>The first problem is that the material control business of the Commerce Control Council has been transitioning from a free economy to a controlled economy for seven months. If everyone truly understood the current situation of the Chinese economy, they would understand the difficulties in implementing a controlled economy. As for the improvement of the organization, there has been an emphasis on establishing purchasing organizations for other important materials midway. Therefore, some people criticize the Commerce Control Council for focusing too much on organizational form and not considering the feasibility of the current Chinese economic organization and the controlled economy. At the same time, it is necessary to know that its promotion involves politics, and this point should be given special consideration.</p>
<p>Insufficient Cooperation from Businesspeople</p>
<p>The second problem is that some Commerce Control Council offices handle material transfers, import and export permits, and controlled purchasing and distribution of materials, which is no different from the re-emergence of a free economy. Therefore, some businesspeople are unwilling to cooperate with this policy.</p>
<p>This has become a cause for encouraging speculation and hoarding. National capital cannot be used to secure materials and enhance production, but instead becomes a way to buy up materials.</p>
<p>To resolve this focal point, the internal mechanisms of the association must be reformed internally. The last time the Commerce Control Council was reformed, the method of opening this focal point was indirectly a plan to promote cooperation.</p>
<p>Relationship with Relevant Authorities</p>
<p>The Commerce Control Council's transfer to the Executive Yuan is of great significance. The Executive Yuan decides on policies, and the Commerce Control Council promotes them. This avoids the multi-faceted supervision of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Food and clarifies the functions and supervision system. However, this is only a partial countermeasure, so the problem in the future is to allow the Commerce Control Council to fully operate.</p>
<p>Influential people expressed their opinions on this, believing that although the first point has the character of an autonomous organization, all business related to material control cannot be promoted. Second, we should establish a system where national capital can be guided through the Commerce Control Council. Third, there is a lack of comprehensive economic policies.</p>
<p>New Directions for the Future</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned issues cannot be fundamentally resolved, then the rational operation of the Commerce Control Council cannot be expected to improve further than it is now, so the authorities should work on it.</p>
<p>This month, the Commerce Control Council reorganized the Cotton Professional Committee and established a Cotton Department. All cotton textile business is handled by this department in drafting plans. This can be taken as an example of internal organizational reform activities. In addition, the recent change of industry ministers by the National Government can be expected to have a great impact on future operations. From this perspective, the relationship between the Commerce Control Council and the National Government will become closer. Therefore, the Commerce Control Council has now emerged from its initial stage and entered the second stage of achieving its true goals. (Qi Shi: October 25th) Hoarding of Daily Necessities on the Mainland Should Be Punished</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Materials Investigation Committee has actively investigated merchants and private individuals for gauze and cloth that have not been registered in accordance with the law, or for which a request to sell has not been made. Those found in violation have been sealed up and punished, and the hoarded goods have been confiscated and turned over to the government. It is known that during the second phase, from September 16th to October 9th, a total of 964 manufacturers have been investigated, including 405 large and small gauze factories, 87 yarn shops, 84 cloth shops, 14 cotton factories, 368 dyeing factories, and six warehouses. All have been reported for review and registration. It is reported that the committee is currently investigating the yarn inventory of needle factories and will soon expand its scope to investigate daily necessities and military-related materials. Those found hoarding will be punished according to the law.</p>

<h3>Autumn Scenery in the Old Capital - The Activity of Athletes</h3>
<p>Autumn breeze is a good time for people to be energetic and struggle. In ancient China, autumn was often the time for military expeditions. Even the literary examinations were scheduled in the fall. Modern people also use autumn for gatherings. This year, the weather in Beijing in autumn is particularly good, so there are many opportunities for athletes to show their skills. Already opened is the autumn sports meet of national universities on October 18, which is organized by the General Association of Life Committees of National Colleges and Universities. Participants include Peking University: Liberal Arts, Science, Law, Agriculture, Engineering, six colleges, Normal University and male and female middle school attachments, elementary school attachments, and Foreign Languages ​​College, and specialized schools. Visitors include Chairman Wang's representative, Zhang Zhongzhi, Director of Political Affairs Office, Su Tiren from the Education Office, Wang Xun, Director of the Canteen and representatives from various agencies, tens of thousands of people, an extremely grand event. In addition to some physical performances, the overall champion of the track and field events for both men and women is Normal University. It is a pity that there are no record-breaking achievements. Is it because of insufficient nutrition? The autumn review of the Security Army is being planned. It is said that "the schedule of the review has been drafted, and other preparations have been completed, and the event is expected to begin this month." In addition, the preparatory work for the New People's Society's Joint Council has "decided to hold a grand event at the Huai Ren Hall in Zhongnanhai, Beijing from the 26th to the 30th of this month, gathering representatives of 100 million people in North China." Most noteworthy is that this time the entire joint meeting will gather 15,000 young people from various parts of North China to hold a grand review. These are all noteworthy wartime autumn maneuvers.</p>
<p>Agricultural Experimental Field</p>
<p>Going from Beijing out the Xizhimen to Longevity Hill, there is a dignified ancient road, although it has now been paved with asphalt and has become a modern road, the old cypresses and willows on both sides can really evoke the feeling of "ancient road in the setting sun". On the first Double Tenth Festival after the war, the autumn was clear and the weather was particularly mild. The reporter went to the outskirts to visit the old sites. Unintentionally, midway between Xizhimen and Longevity Hill, he saw a very modern building with the national flags of China and Japan erected high on the roof. This building turned out to be the newly completed North China Agricultural Experiment Field.</p>
<p>The North China Agricultural Experiment Field is an institution that began to be established in April of the 27th year (1938). It was originally called the Central Agricultural Experiment Field, and was renamed the North China Agricultural Experiment Field in June of the 29th year (1940). The director is Mr. Akimoto. The original location was the old site of the National University at Taiping Lake. Later, because the site was too small, construction of a new site in the western suburbs began in the 28th year (1939). First, a training department for technicians was established at the new site, and then it moved into the section that was completed. Now it is fully completed and the entire institution has moved in.</p>
<p>The North China Agricultural Experiment Field has seven departments, including the Cultivation Department, the Agricultural and Forestry Chemistry Department, the Disease and Insect Department, the Agricultural Water Conservancy Department, the Forestry Department, the Animal Husbandry Department, and the Livestock Epidemic Prevention Department. It also has a secretary, documents, and accounting sections. In addition, an agricultural technology training department has been opened, specializing in training agricultural technicians. The students are all junior high school graduates, and after two years of training, they are considered graduates. There are now five graduating classes, with approximately 500 people.</p>
<p>Outside of Beijing, the North China Agricultural Experiment Field also has fifteen branch fields: Shimen Yunliangcheng, Jinan, Qingdao, and Kaifeng. There is also a branch field in Changli, two experiment fields in Jiqing and Xuzhou, and thirteen original branch groups in Nanyuan, Zhangde Baoding, Handan Chengyang Tangshan Changxian An Zhangdian Linqing Cuiji, Linfen and Xinxiang.</p>
<p>The new building has three floors. The third floor is the auditorium, the second floor is for the various departments, and the first floor is occupied by the three sections and the various departments. In addition to this building, there are also about 11,000 acres of farmland around it, cultivating wheat, millet, sorghum, corn, rice, cotton, hemp and other agricultural products. It is a very large farm. It is said that the North China Agricultural Experiment Field will also hold a ceremony to celebrate the completion of the new building on the 15th of this month to celebrate the formation of this huge economic airport during the war.

<h3>The Imminent Wheat Crop - Increased Production Work</h3>
<p>— Yang</p>
<p>These past few days are the period when the rice harvest is about to end and the wheat sowing is about to begin. When crops are harvested, their control should be strengthened to ensure reasonable supply and demand and appropriate distribution. When crops are sown, technology should be guided to improve quality and increase production. Recently, many papers on the control of rice and grain have been seen, and discussions on increasing wheat production seem to be further developed.</p>
<p>Wheat, as an autumn-sown crop, has the same importance as rice in the food problem. Especially today when there is a shortage of rice, the position of wheat is increasing day by day. Take the food for the citizens of Shanghai, for example, if there is no distribution of household flour, the severity of the situation will be several times greater than it is today.</p>
<p>The area from Changzhou to the east on the Jinghu Line is mainly focused on the production of japonica rice, and there is very little wheat cultivation. However, northern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, the vicinity of Zhenjiang, east of Hankou, and along the Nanning Line (Nanjing and Wuhu) are all indica rice areas. Because the harvest of indica rice is very early, wheat is sown as soon as it is harvested. Therefore, the area where wheat is sown is no less than that of rice.</p>
<p>Chinese farmers have reached a fairly sophisticated level in their research on rice cultivation techniques, so it is relatively difficult to see results in rice improvement work. Wheat cultivation, on the other hand, is mostly laissez-faire. As long as a little guidance is given, great results can be achieved. The most important wheat improvement items are listed below.</p>
<p>Promote Improved Varieties of Wheat - The yield is greatly related to the quantity and quality of seeds. Before the Incident, Jinling University developed a wheat variety called 2905, which can increase the yield of wheat by 32% compared to ordinary varieties. Although this variety is now somewhat degraded due to poor preservation, a yield increase rate of more than 20% can still be maintained. Last year, the agricultural improvement zones established by the Ministry of Industry in various places mainly focused on promoting 2905 wheat, distributing it to farmers for free, and achieving considerable results. Wheat is about to be sown now. Local government agencies should urgently find ways to obtain a large amount of 2905 wheat and promote it to farmers. Inquiries about this variety can be made to the Production Increase Department of the Ministry of Food, where it may be available.</p>
<p>Warm Water Seed Soaking - The most serious disease of wheat is smut, and its loss is equivalent to the rice stem borer or locust plague. Diseased wheat grains have a thin membrane on the outside and black powder inside. The method of preventing this disease is very simple. Before sowing, the seeds must be disinfected by soaking them in warm water. The method is to prepare two large buckets, one filled with hot water at 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) and the other filled with hot water at 56 degrees Celsius (132 degrees Fahrenheit), and the immersion bucket. Then, put the seeds into a bamboo basket, first soak them in the warm bucket, and wait for all the seeds to be warm before soaking them in the immersion bucket. After five minutes, take them out and pour in a large amount of water to cool them quickly, then sow them, or dry them in the shade and store them for later use. If salt water is used to soak the seeds before warm water soaking to eliminate inferior varieties that float on the surface and select full-grained, good varieties, the effect will be even better. Guide Strip Sowing - Farmers in the Jinghu area mostly use broadcasting method to sow wheat, which is extremely inconvenient for inter-cultivation, weeding, and fertilization, resulting in a great impact on yield and wasting fertilizer (ordinary strip sowers apply one burden of fertilizer per acre each time, while broadcasters need one burden per acre). Therefore, it is urgent to guide them to use strip sowing. However, strip sowing takes more time when sowing, and farmers, accustomed to old habits, are unwilling to listen, so additional guidance is needed.</p>
<p>Popularize Fertilizers - Fertilizer is an important element for increasing production. Nowadays, farmers are either because of costs, or because of strength, which is a cause for concern. We must pay attention to persuasion. The self-sufficient fertilizers for wheat cultivation include compost and manure. Each acre requires about ten担 of compost, and one cow can produce one hundred担 of compost per year, which is enough for ten acres of wheat field. Manure from livestock such as chickens, ducks, and sheep, as well as human manure, are also the best fertilizers for wheat cultivation. Each person excretes about one and a half担 of manure per year, which can be used for one acre of wheat field for one fertilization. As for chemical fertilizers, the manufacturing and popularization of phosphate fertilizers is an urgent need. Because ammonium sulfate requires extremely large capital, production cannot be increased arbitrarily. Phosphate fertilizer raw materials can be obtained from animal bones, which is more convenient. However, its manufacture and promotion depend on the research of experts and the guidance of the government.</p>
<p>The above four points are the most urgent and simplest methods for wheat production. As long as there is a right to implement the determination and to mobilize, the results can be seen immediately. Now, wheat in various places will be sown in its entirety within this month. Those who are concerned about the food problem, please pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>The Distress of Trade Associations</h3>
<p>— Shui Zhaoxiong</p>
<p>From the perspective of time, location, and scope, trade associations are indeed insignificant. But the mission they bear is very important. It is a large family of members, a collection of the same industry. All the pains felt by member manufacturers, an excellent trade association, is to communicate unanimously. To say it again, the distress of member manufacturers is the distress of trade associations.</p>
<p>What distress do trade associations have these days? That is, they are mostly busy with "creating something out of nothing" all day long. As Shanghai Special Municipal Government No. 12185 promulgated, "Items are also often difficult to be detained by the medical staff, which is not right." Because this kind of thing is inevitable, the trade association has to be busy with negotiations, and one person is not enough, so two people go together. Sometimes they even have to bring in acquaintances to say something. For one thing, repeated official documents, sent in separate ways, waiting for a reply, or sending personnel again, or signing and presenting again. And the members whose goods are detained, either by telephone, or in person, wait anxiously all day long, hoping for a solution. Sometimes the goods that are detained have been taken out from one place, but unfortunately they are stopped by another place. Back and forth like this, negotiating, saying various things, so that the entire association is busy with this kind of "creating something out of nothing" thing. Although it may be due to the difficulty of the medical staff in identifying controlled items at one time, and the authorities have announced that they must not be detained for any reason, and they hope that the situation will improve, but in the eyes of others, they always think that the people who run the association are somewhat "self-disturbing". Who has ever known.</p>
<p>In all cases, there is inevitably a situation of being detained. The negotiation of trade associations is like jumping over hurdles, and the staff of the trade unions are like athletes jumping over hurdles. We are constantly jumping over hurdles, just to achieve a complete record. We don't expect that there will be no obstacles, and we also hope that each obstacle is not too high or too big. Similarly, we talk about business in business. For politics, we dare not over-expect, we only hope to do as Confucius said, "Politics is righteousness." To be more detailed, the hope of general manufacturers is as pointed out by Eiichi Shibusawa, the highest leader in the Japanese financial world during the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa periods: "Politics is neither power nor force. Politics obviously cannot but be morality. This is the foundation of politics." Standing on the position of industry and commerce that is not partisan, what the trade association hopes for is the combination of politics and morality, which can also be said to be the political concept of the industrial and commercial class.</p>

<h3>China Health Association Promotes - Eliminating Sources of Disease and Preventing Contagion</h3>
<p>The China Health Association, for the purpose of raising funds for the relief of the poor and sick, organized a charity swimming competition, which was held at Taishan Road Lanqi the day before yesterday afternoon. Regarding the implementation of sports, it has been decided to handle the following inspection cases: Starting next month, the city's health and wellness campaign will be launched, starting with X-ray prevention of tuberculosis examination, with a total number of 10,000 people. The free examination will be given away starting next month by the Xin Shen Er Bao Social Service Department, Doctors' Association, and donors this time, in order to popularize it. Once a lung disease is discovered during the examination, compression therapy will be implemented in order to eliminate the focus of the disease, early treatment, so as to avoid contagion and spread. No fees will be charged, with a total number of 300 to 500 people. The significance of this health check and free treatment is to eliminate the existence of latent diseases in society, to achieve early treatment and early recovery and to engage in production and stabilize the social economy. Assuming that this time can achieve saving 300 to 500 people with early treatment, otherwise, if treatment is started only after the illness is serious, it will cost 30,000 yuan per person. The intangible savings in medical expenses have reached more than ten million yuan, and it will be able to engage in productivity earlier and avoid intangible contagion, and the harvest will be ten or one hundred times this number. The total amount of donations this time has reached 45,000 yuan, but it is still 150,000 yuan short of the goal. I hope that people from all walks of life will attach importance to the importance of this kind of active public health care and medical care and help to promote it, donating generously, one thousand yuan can save a life, and at the same time stabilize their family life, so that they will not be trapped by poverty and disease. There is nothing better than this for benefiting people. Donations are still collected by the Social Service Department of this newspaper until the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Four Days of Charity Sale for School Aid</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouzhong</p>
<p>Day 1</p>
<p>October 2nd, Saturday</p>
<p>At 2:30, our team set off. At first, no one was willing to take the signs, buckets, or carry flower bags. They complained that these were too crude. The sign was like Lu Ju's shield in "Walking Mai City," the bucket looked like the Taoist bucket carried by street singers, and the bag? Like the yellow soul-calling bag of Song Jiang, who killed his daughter-in-law while sitting upstairs. Alas, who would want to take these things? Sure enough, no one was willing to do it. In the end, it was thanks to the children sent by Jiande Primary School who helped.</p>
<p>When we arrived on the road, we divided into groups and went to the designated areas to sell. As soon as our group of four arrived at the destination, a gentleman riding a bicycle stopped and waved two flowers at us. We all grinned, overjoyed. The first sale was not bad, but then the second gentleman gave us a hard time. He took a flower and gave us ten yuan. When the money was put into the bucket, he asked us to give him change. How could we give change when the money was in the bucket? In the end, he taught us a lesson and took two flowers to settle the matter.</p>
<p>Day 2</p>
<p>October 3rd, Sunday, around 9:00 am. Our group of three appeared at the entrance of the Great Shanghai Grand Theatre. We tried to sell to three people, two gentlemen in suits and a modern girl, but unfortunately, we were all rejected. In disappointment, we left the Great Shanghai and came to a corner of the Four Great Companies. We spent a lot of effort, humbly and smiling, calling "Sir" many times, but the results were not as good as yesterday. In fact, this was within our expectations. We were not disappointed, because most of the people who come and go on the road in the morning are diligent people who have a certain mission to use their free time. After all, there are few people who go to the early morning movie. To take a step back, the gentlemen who stroll on the road or go to the early morning movie are not generous. Being glared at by three people in the Great Shanghai is a precedent.</p>
<h3>Cotton Textile Guild Publication - Charity Sale for School Aid</h3>
<p>Shanghai Special City Factory Industry Guild is the most active and vibrant group among the trade associations. Since its establishment, the association has been publishing a monthly magazine to enrich the intellectual interests of its members. The fifth issue has now been published, and the content has been increased compared to the previous issues. In addition to being read by branch members, the association has specially allocated 1,000 copies of the newspaper to be sold on consignment by this newspaper. The proceeds from the sale will be used as teaching and medical funds for this newspaper. If people from all walks of life need to purchase it for reference, they can purchase it at the consignment sales department of this newspaper for five yuan each.</p>
<h3>Unemployment Relief Group - Promoting Work</h3>
<p>The Mutual Aid Unemployment Relief Group was founded by Wu Ping and Yao Yi. Private funds are accumulated to purchase daily necessities and redistribute them to unemployed members to sell. All profits are earned by the salespeople. The funds are temporarily 200,000 yuan, which is entirely the responsibility of the founder, Mr. Wu Ping, and no donations are solicited from the outside world. Currently, the group has twelve members who have begun selling daily necessities. The purpose of this work is to reduce the suffering of unemployed people. We hope that people from all walks of life will help the members of the group with support, develop human mutual assistance, and it is heard that the group will also hold auxiliary hidden poverty work. For details, please write to the group's office at 626 Yuqiaqing Road or inquire at the Social Service Department of this newspaper.</p>
<h3>Charity Sale of Calligraphy and Paintings - Relieving Hidden Poverty</h3>
<p>After reading the column on the 20th of this month, there is a story about saving the poor teacher Fan. A hidden name, because his friend Yu is suffering from the same poverty and disease, plans to sell a Tang Dynasty painting from his family collection for 8,000 yuan. The proceeds from the sale will be used to donate one-quarter to Teacher Fan, and the rest will be donated to Mr. Yu. After reading it, I deeply sympathize.</p>
<p>Because my friend Bao is in a difficult situation, which is comparable to that of Fan and Yu. I feel even more pity. I want to provide assistance, but I am limited by my finances and unable to do so. Later, I found a way to obtain an ancient Kangxi script from my friend, totaling 40 volumes (Guangxu seven-year edition, and a large-character six-character four-sentence vertical axis, and four paintings (each character as big as a bucket), which I plan to sell. The minimum price for each item is 1,000 yuan. The proceeds will be divided into three parts, one-quarter to Fan Gui, one-quarter to the book and newspaper school aid fund, and the remaining two-quarters will be used to relieve my friend's needs. I think there are many generous and benevolent people in Shanghai who will bestow Yu to achieve success. If you have any inquiries, please write to Hu Deqin, Room 3, No. 7, Lane 230, Zhaomen Road. (Pang Zongxian)</p>
<h3>The Poor Teacher's Gratitude</h3>
<p>Birth, old age, sickness, and death are inevitable stages of life. Loving life and fearing death are human nature. I, however, do not worry or fear death. As for the suffering of illness, I have often pondered why it gathers upon me. I then realized that constitutions have their strengths and weaknesses, and that being too thin makes one susceptible to disease. Now, if I want to strengthen myself, I must rely on medicine. After the Shen Bao published my humble article, on October 14th, an old gentleman came immediately to inquire about my daily life and the details of my illness. Three days later, he came again, investigated thoroughly, and bestowed funds upon me. Upon asking his name, I learned it was Wang. Late at night, a Mr. Zheng, accompanied by his friend, came to my residence with quiet sincerity and diligence. They inquired in detail, and before leaving, they secretly placed banknotes on my desk, truly generous gentlemen. A young man gave me thirty yuan, his face flushed with a sincere apology. I did not slight him for the small amount and thanked him. Mr. Wang braved the rain to come and, on behalf of his friend, gifted me with white yuan, comforting me and saying, "After you recover, my friend is willing to introduce you to a suitable job to increase your income." Mr. Qin from Dongting Mountain gifted me a copy of the Book of Poetry. Mr. Yu not only donated money but also invited his close friend, the great physician Sun Dingyuan, to jointly cover my medical expenses, demonstrating a heart of kindness and treating everyone equally, his benevolence being a cut above the rest. My classmate Shen Chunyan, whom I haven't seen in a long time, saved up his money from quitting smoking and drinking and delivered one hundred and fifty yuan for me to buy medicine. Mr. Zhao Zuli's elder brother, named Hou, is over seventy years old and was an old colleague of mine. After reading the report, he immediately asked his grandson to send five hundred yuan. From the hospital side, Deji sent someone to call the Second Emergency Epidemic</p>
<p>Hospital and sent a letter advising me to go for treatment, waiving all fees. I politely declined because I could not move. A certain lady saved her children's (who are currently ill) medical expenses and donated them to me, her enthusiasm being particularly commendable. Finally, that lady gave me a hundred yuan and a peck of rough rice. Who am I that I receive such attention from warm-hearted people in society? Besides being grateful and never forgetting their great kindness, after recovering from my illness, I will do my best to contribute to beneficial social undertakings to repay the kindness of everyone (Fan Xingshu).</p>
<p>Lecture on Scripture The Gospel Hall of the Shanghai Chinese Christian Independent Church is hosting a Great Scripture Lecture Conference from the 29th of this month to the 21st, with lectures given at Trinity Church on Hankou Road, Jiangxi Road, at 5 PM every afternoon. Prominent pastors have been specially invited to lecture. All are welcome to attend.</p>
<p>Lost Money Found I found some cash on Henan Road on the 25th of this month. I hope the loser will explain the details and claim it. If it is not claimed after three days, it will be sent to a charitable organization (Fan Dilang) Office at No. 701, No. 209 Jiangxi Road, Jingxian Department of the First District Public Office of Shanghai Special Municipality.</p>
<p>Seeking Lost Item At 2 PM on the 24th, I lost a Western-style raincoat inside my seat on the upper floor of the Nanjing Grand Theatre when the movie ended. According to the store in the theater, two people were seen holding the raincoat and claiming to deliver it to the accounting room, but the accounting room said that no one had handed it over. If anyone picked up the raincoat, please deliver it to Mr. Chen in Room of Huiluo Company, No. 98 Nanjing Road, and a reward will be offered.</p>
