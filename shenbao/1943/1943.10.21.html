<h3 id="c1">準備冬賑 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>光陰荏苒，炎夏甫過，又屆殘秋，轉瞬之間，嚴冬蒞臨。朔風凛冽，冷砭肌骨的景象，已經距離不遠，我們試瞑目一想，貧苦同胞，無衣無食，在冷風怒號中支撑，其情其景，足以激發我們人類的同情與惻隱之心，而思有以出錢出力援救之。</p>
<p>年年有　寒，年年有貧苦同胞，社會人士本於惻隱與同情之心，年年發起冬賑運動，以救濟貧苦同胞勉强渡過嚴寒時期。因此，辦理冬賑，可以說是經常的，與發生某種特殊災害，而臨時舉辦賑濟者不同。所以，辦理冬賑在時間是絕不會感到匆促，很可從容籌措，按步就班，實施賑濟計劃。</p>
<p>本來，賑務是政府一部份的責任，政府也有專任辦理賑務的機關。其次，社會上各極慈善性的辦賑團體，各自斟酌其所有力量舉辦一部份賑務。一般的說，政府賑務機關辦賑，失之官樣文章，迂迴曲折，效用不彰。慈善賑務團體辦賑，則各自為政，缺乏綜台力量，未能發揮最高效率。如果由政府機關領導，聯絡各慈善團體，經費與施賑，確定一個目標，同一步驟，分工合作，那末，辦賑的效果，必定比較散漫無方者為佳。</p>
<p>根據上面　理由，我們可以說，辦理賑務，尤其是經常性的賑務，必先具備兩個條件，第一，重視時間性，宜於從容準備，而不宜於匆促成事。第二，重視綜合力量，政府賑務機關與社會慈善團體之間，各慈善團體彼此之間，都須取得聯絡一致，以收綜合力量的效率。</p>
<p>冬賑是經常性的賑務，上海的冬賑，每年舉辦的，依據我們的見解，應該注意於卜面的兩個條件。可是，我們覆按本市去年度的冬賑，政府機關方面，直至今年一月初句才由市政府主持，開始舉辦，冬賑時期，事實上已屆春賑之期，在時間上過於落後，因嚴冬威脅而受凍餒痛苦的難民，已經得不到冬賑之施惠了。所以，今年的冬賑，在時間上必須特別重視，現在已屆殘秋，轉瞬嚴冬，正當準備之期，願政府機關以及社會慈善團體及早準備，從容佈置。於此，我們提供管見，以備社會人士共同硏討：</p>
<p>第一，我們必須重複申述的，為期賑務效能的提高，應由政府機關負領導責任，並與各施賑團體，取得密切聯繫。上海市貧病救濟協會，原為各民間慈善團體之領導機構，過去辦理頗具成績，現已結束，因此，聯繫工作更感需要，盼望市社會福利局於今年冬賑負起領導責任。過去施賑團體之間，各自為政，缺乏聯繫的結果，不免弊　業生，例如施衣一項，時有重複之處，在甲團體領得後再往乙團體領取。狡黠者領到衣服後，往往變賣金錢，而忠實者無衣可領，以致因組織不嚴密而發生之矛盾，傳播社會，足使捐輸者望而却步。此類事件的產生，因為施賑團體之間未能密切聯繫，致被不良份子利用機會施伎巧取。我們盼望今年冬賑中，由政府機關主持，延請各團體的主持人暨辦賑技術人員，先行開會討論，各以經騐報吿，彙成極嚴密的施賑辦法，絕對防止種種矛盾與浪費事實，俾捐施的一點一滴，都為受施人實惠。</p>
<p>第二，待賑者約有兩種，一為隱貧，一為赤貧。對於隱貧者施以救濟，如施衣施粥施藥等等，解其一時期的困厄；對於赤貧者，尤須籌謀積極的治本辦法，　如小本貸金，予以謀生機會；移殖歸農，開墾土地，自食共力。其次，貧苦者又分兩種：一為殘廢及年幼者，祇能敎之養之；一為成年而有做事能力者，應以工代賑，務必使之生產，自食其力。至於上海原有慈善團體不必留滬者，例如淺廢院，養老院等，均須移入內地，寗由海方面籌　經費。</p>
<p>第三，經費方面，不在於數目龐大，難於籌集，而在於捐款用途的得當與否？能否取得捐款人的信仰與否？捐款總數目標，固應假定，但須一邊捐款，一邊即辦施賑，以辦賑成績的事實為宣傳，而引起捐款人的不斷興趣，因此，數目雖巨，不愁無人捐款。如因捐款未達目標，即按款不動，一方面則事務費源源支出，事業未辦而賑款日少。此點尤為辦賑者所常注意。</p>
<p>第四，捐款的方法頗多，但娛樂塲所以及大酒館等等地方，不妨加以特別注意，實取諸不為虐。至於支配方面，應以積極性的賑濟事業佔數較大。</p>
<p>第五，經費旣已籌得，辦法旣已妥訂，而執行的人事，亦極重要，旣須熱心任事，又具負責精神。</p>
<p>冬賑的時期，轉瞬即屆，我們為貧苦同胞設想，盼望當局暨各慈善團體共同注意，及早準備，俾今年冬賑的成績比較往年優良，卽貧苦同胞得到的實惠，比較往年更多。</p>

<p>想到前綫馬革裏屍的將士們為國殉忠，自然覺悟到在後方的我們民衆的使命。在我們面前，祗有一條路—增强戰力。日本政府此次的措置，「强化国内熊勢然拋棄一切因循敷衍的缺點而增强戰力，在今日決戰時期下，乃是當然的措置。囘顧各交戰國的現狀時，不問其為軸心國或反軕心國，青說心國或反軕心國，青說已失之過遲了。這方策乃是在增强戰力的各方面，如行政運營的決戰化，國民總動員，重要企業的國家性之明確化，運輸的强化，財政的確立，配給的戰時化，及國內防衛態勢的徹底化等各方之綜合的計劃，强化国内態勢方策，至此乃有了完全的形式。無論那一項，是目前不可缺的要求。雖不能斷定那一項是最重要，但在國家的指導下運　戰爭經濟的這時候，行政運營之徹底的決戰化，實可斷言即為其中心。行政運　的適常與否，在增强生产上立即右重大的影響，此次方策一開頭就出「行政運　決戰化，在九月二十二日晚東條首相的　佈上，亦特別强调這一點，由此可知其重要性。同時，政府的企圖，亦可由此推察而得。</p>
<p>行政的新體制</p>
<p>行政的刷新强化，歷代內閣即已有此主張，在最近，第二次近衛內閣，即提出政界新體制案，作為確立國內新體制之一環，以謀政治力的强化，行政機構的改革，官司廰事務之的簡捷能力化，嗣在第三次近衛內閣中，又積極進行準備，而獲得成案，茲在付諸實施時，已告下台。在太平洋風雲緊張聲中，繼該內閣之後，在昭和十六年十月十八日成立的東條內閣，為適應當時國內外諸情勢起見，卽首以確立國內的政治經濟及其各方面的穩固態勢為當前急務，沿襲近衛內閣的有關於此的方針，而急於實施，同年十二月八日，大東亞戰爭勃發，為傾國家總力以求戰勝計，國內態勢的整務，不容片刻躊躇，該內閣適應前綫的赫赫戰果，謀統帥國務的　全調幣，而實施適宜適切的施策，為完逐道大戰爭，需要國內打成一片，卽在國內確立上下一致，如臂使指的組織。</p>
<p>所以東條內閣所企圖者，是政治力的强化及和此有關的行政機構之根本的改訂。此時恰値在南方佔領地需在大批的軍政在員，這時局的要求，在行政機構的改構上加上一層刺激，去年六月十九日的定例閣議上，決定「行政簡素强力化實施要領」，七月二十八晶的閣議上，又決定該實施案，宣　裁員，其標準為中央直　機關三成，地　機關二成，技術機關一成，同時並改善公務員的議率。八月十一日的部長能，決定該案。至十一月一日，毅然實施行政簡素化，設置大東亞省，中央地方行政一元化，並改善官吏待遇。至此，戰爭下行政機構之劃時期的刷新與强化，戰勝長期戰的政界必勝態勢，乃暫告確立。</p>
<p>事務的簡捷化</p>
<p>在第一方面，政府為謀事務的　捷化計，在第八十一屆通常議會中提出戰時行政特例法案，許可認可等臨時措置法案，而經表決，自本年三月十八日起實施，戰時行政職權特例，亦廉時發動，而從事除復查生產的狹路，他如內閣顧問制的創設，行政查察制度的　置等，亦均為適　目前所要求的增强战力諸施策。至最的這，在六月末，如創設地方行政協議會等，相應於日趨激烈的戰局，政府的努力，尤以確立戰爭行政的熱　，瞭然可見。</p>
<p>可是政府雖屢次改革行政權構，並刷新　能，但在應付最近極變幻之能事的戰局上，尚有不少缺點，　府乃終謚有此次的措置。强化国内態勢的方法，可列為第一的「行政運營之決戰化」，其內容如政務執行的敏　化，從中　關移讓權限於地方　關，預算之徹底的單純化、政府機關事務的簡素化，尤以許可認可事項的整理，對重　產業的許可認可。　督系統的廢止及簡易化，行政機構之徹底的簡素化中，政府機關人員之大量裁减，军官对得要產業發令定貨的一元化，官員紀律之徹底的　正及政府　關執行政務的決戰化等，在行政各方面。提出了許多有決斷的方策。</p>
<p>定貨的一元化，書類監督制廢止，許可認可制的簡略化，　正官紀，民間人士早已有此主張。定貨的一元化，在何種形式上　現，不能預測，但陸海軍的定貨竸爭，一向是時常引起的問題，而有　碍兵器的增產並質的向上之嫌，有鑒於此種事　，一般人乃熱烈希望政府之勇敢而果斷的措</p>
<p>企業的監督制</p>
<p>對企業的監督制　　可　可等，雖可說從　　自由經濟時代之自由奔放的經濟活動這目的出發而加以規定，但像今日這樣在國家指導下運營統制經濟上，不僅認為不必要，茜至阻礙生產之飛躍的增强，於是希望有一種適急的措置。尤以大規模企業整備在斷然施中的今日，更為需要。　正官紀在戰時下這名詞依然似乎只放在口頭上空談，而未見實行。行政對經濟各部門的指導力，正在日趨擴大中。官紀的廢馳，當然直接造成在戰力增强上的障害，並將搖動一意向完途聖戰而邁進的國民的忠心，這是很可佈的。官史的　職，雖然應該責備官司吏本身，但使官吏犯這種過失的民間業者，也應大為自戒。</p>
<p>國內的每個角落裏，一切人的物的資源，迅速變成戰力，這是當　的要務。因此，地方　政能力之全面的發揮，可說是目前的重要課題，本年七月的地方長官會議席上，　條首相會約定移讓權限於地方機關，此次的方策，卽為這約定的實現。六月成立開始工作的地方行政協議會，其機能更被强化。</p>
<p>中央權限移讓</p>
<p>中央機關對郵道·府·縣並地方　特別機關移讓權限，業已毅然實施，其結果，具有指示權，指示　　權的地方行政協議會會長的權限，列趨擴大，這樣，中央機關的企劃官　化，地方機關之執行官應化的傾向，今後將更被促進。關於行政機構的再整理，目前各機關已獲有成案，在九月二十六日前提出於內閣，經內閣長官的調整後，二十八日的閣議以後，一一加以決定，而迅即實施。他如行政機構運營的戰內化，國內防衛　勢的徹底强化，及附　團體的整理等，當其實施時所必要的者，即為當其　者之大　斷及頭腦之徹底的大轉變，不是為了改革機構的改革，亦不是為了整理的整理，一切都是為了在此次戰爭中求勝利的手段。無論是官司吏也好，附屬團體的關係者也好，民間人士也好，此時應毅然拋棄以前的方式，而復還於為日本帝國之一臣民的自覺。此次的强化国内態勢方策，能否結實，全賴於此，（　：　自九月二十五日四部朝日新　）</p>

<p>米糧統制委員會於前日召開各地區管備委員大會後，即攢閉各地區　委　談會，該會主任委員寬履登，秘書島周純裕，友邦岡田大佐代表海口顧問，榮部隊笠原少佐等，以及該會重要職員，曁各地區採辦　委均行出席，首由袁主任委員作業務指示致詞，繼由岡田大佐代表海口的問，及榮部隊笠原少佐致詞，最後由周秘書長解答各種章則，至下午六時圓滿閉會，並定今晨召開各地區正副主任舉行聯席會議，至於米　採買及配給工作，可即日　開。茲錄　談會經過於下：</p>
<p>主委指示方針</p>
<p>袁主任委員履登致詞，指示業務方針云：「今天在舉行各地　　備姿員大會之　，又繼續開心懇談會，承各位繼續出席，很為感佩。現先由本席來發表幾點意見；</p>
<p>共同負責</p>
<p>米糧本來是前保衛大東亞戰爭，正在展開之際，我們　理糧政的人，一方面要維持民食，一方而要供應軍需，有　雙重的責任，當然更加覺　這事情得緊要和重大了。中日雙方各位委員，都是當代名流，對於糧政向來巳有相當的硏究，各地區採　同業公會的各地　備委員，　都是身家殷且都是米糧樂的　手，戶當竭盡心力，閧誠布公，會同諸位，實是　是的做責，總　　做出美滿的成績來。</p>
<p>勿圖非份</p>
<p>米糧關係民食，本來不能當作純粹的商品，而聽憑普通商人自由買賣的，目前民食恐慌，又兼軍需車要，更加不能常做商貨而完全以牟利爲目的了。所以我希　　營米糧的人，在目前千萬不可專用生意的眼光，而常做一種交易做，除出正當利潤之外，千萬不可貪　非份的盈餘，一方面要顯着國計，一方面要顧着民生，一方面還要顧着軍需，那未　得的利益自然有的，否則非出得不到利益，而且身敗名裂，也許就是這件事情的結果。</p>
<p>照價付錢</p>
<p>農民終年辛苦，才收獲一些米糧，雖銳目前糧價很高，但是現在百物　貴，農民們　盒錢去買，除米糧以外的日用必需品，價目也是很高的，所以米價雖高，而農村的　濟並不怎樣寬裕，也就是這個　故，此後我們村農村　去收買米糧，務必要照規定的價格付錢倘有私　刻扣掃侵，剝蝕斗秤的舉動，我們一定要破除情而。請主管　　嚴重罰辦。</p>
<p>密切聯絡</p>
<p>本會是一　首腦機關，對於業務方面，如組織要綱，調度資金等事，綜攬其成，此外如採辦儲存等業務，還在各地區辦事處，尤其是在各地區採辦商的身上，此後谷地區採辦商同業公會，和本會各地區辦事處，以及對於本會，都要取得密切的聯絡，上下內外，不論在形式上，在精神上，都要脈絡貫通，呼應靈便，不論甚麼事情，我們要用極迅速的手段，依照程序進行，倘使發生甚麽　碍，我們也要急疾地打破牠，照　樣才能增進辦事的效率，得到預期的結果</p>
<p>岡田代表致詞</p>
<p>岡田大佐代表海口顧問致詞云：全國商業統制總會，設立於本年三月，掌理收買重要物資及　制事務，關於米糧之收買以　爲最　要物資之一部。亦應交商統曾理。</p>
<p>取得諒解</p>
<p>惟當　在蘇浙皖三省之米糧　買及統制，均屬國　政府直接辦理·而於商統會並無收買之組織，且因米糧之供給，不得一日或國，故中日之軍米及上海雨京等民需米之配給，仍應歸糧食部繼續辦理，如糧會部突然中止收買，對糧政之圓滿施行，必有發生陰碍之虞，故使糧食部暫行繼續收買，一俟新穀登塲，則交與商統會辦理，對中日雙方之軍官方面，亦業經得其諒解。</p>
<p>圓滿移交</p>
<p>基於上即之諒解本年七月初旬，糧食部對行政院申請將米穀收買統制之一切事務，移交商統會辦理，幸賴軍官之協助，及袁主任委員以下各委員之熱心努力，　得圓滿解決移交問題，而辦車，構　中日同業公會之組織，次第成就。際此開同業公會籌備委員大會之時，兄弟爲有　之一份子，感覺非常欣慰，本日兄弟不顧僭越，代表對於本會有特殊功動之岡因大佐，於實施收買上有參考之必要，及應注意幾點，略述如下：</p>
<p>價格問題</p>
<p>第一關於收買價格，收買價格經有關處官及米商各位之熱心協議，愼重決定，業經發表、對於生產者及消費者各方面之立塲，加以充分之考慮，而以公正明朗爲宗旨，並且在一年之內，絕不變更其價格，故特請各位應　農民注意，切勿以爲到明年，其價格一定增高，而不願脫手，至於農民實際上應收之價格，在甲地區為粳米七二〇元，秈米七〇〇元，而在乙地區準此，在甲地區內爲保護生產者起見，所定價格應嚴守之，而在乙地區之接近敵區之關係，對其治安運輸方面，庶加考慮，其在邊僻地區收買時，不　悉依定意嚴守價根，但不許隨意　價，其價格應準甲區，卽此之意。</p>
<p>全力協助</p>
<p>總之，不應使農夫過受痛苦　宗旨，　今日　塲各位籌備委員，皆為依　米統會之方針，而被指定者　故對於收買上之心　，　用　育，備　各位應理。現行情勢，暫以犧牲精神，從事事業，若專事追求眼前之利益，不顧國家民生，必蒙受天罰，請在短期內努力猛進，實爲至盼，對於米糧之搬遝，倘發生障碍、日本軍官方面，當協力排除之，請　常取得密切聯絡，此外對正當營業而勞力者·當予以一切之協助、惟其中倘有專營不當之私利，其實　不舉者、本會應予以嚴厲之處分。</p>
<p>笠原少佐致詞</p>
<p>一六二九部隊　少佐致詞云，鄙人以日本軍用米採辦主任之立塲，對諸位講幾句話，關於本年度採辦米之重要點，剛才各位說得很詳細，毋庸　　，鄙人從前在常地採辦米糧所獲經騐，且對各位講二三個要　如下：</p>
<p>排除困難</p>
<p>對收　很　要之　　　　到　功·須有旺盛之責任與觀念，及　　　　、本年度收買米內分地區別縣別等、已決定各收買數量、在地區內之採　　，要根據本　　，對支配數量，負責收買，排除一切困難，不顧勞苦，不嫌利少，更不惜性命危險，下最　之決心，以犧牲之精神進行，將其精神在素負名望及偉大之　　登氏中心之下，中日商家握手、互相合作、　待本年度採辦米之成功。</p>
<p>注意米質</p>

<p>中國有一句名言：一窮　變，　則通。」　以一窮　當作「窮於應付」的解釋，則天下事，無論爲馬於個人方面或國家社會方面，凡有感覺窮於應付之時，則不妨以「變通辦理」的方法來　　之。因此，由於收買紗布後所引起的經濟界嚴　波動，我們於擁護政府立塲之餘，亦會買獻過幾個變通　法，以資補救金融社會所遭逢之困難，即是此意</p>
<p>最近，關於修正上海證券交易所上市股票　　原則，我們聽得許多人士檢討甚得失所在，　爲其中一二處，不是沒有研究調整之價値，例如原則中所載「公司成立之營業一年以上者」，限制誠為　愼，可是，成立一年以上而營業毫無成績者，則當如何？或未滿一年而主持得人，管理有方，信用可靠，生產有辦法，則又常何如？因爲，戰時生產問題的重點，在於　勵各種生產事業，而不僅在於扶助旣成的幾種生產事業；假令確實有裨戰時生產的新興事業，旣有雄厚之資本，復有優良的成績，祇因營業年期之久暫問題，致難獲得其證券投資者之信仰，甯不可惜？其次，「公司實收資本額在國幣五百萬元以上者，（如有增加資本其增資部份未經主管官署核准不得上市），限制賊爲周詳，可是，資本不滿五百萬者，是否即可斷定其為無生產之能力？姑不　論，而其增資部份，旣經收足，即已與原有資本合而爲一；如必以增資部份之核准，為股票上市之條件，在事實上，誠恐托格多端，而其可能性的滿弊，似尤在於登記過程中所離避免的「徇情」與「留難」兩種情事；果然，那就不止於阻滯證券的圓滑流通，甚且影響政治的廉潔行爲了。</p>
<p>我們不能認爲　　意見是吹毛求疵，或是故意挑剔；我們祇能認爲是研究事實問題者的一種懷疑，而其懷疑之點，確又不外乎人情，所以特地把它指點出來，以供大家的研究。</p>

<p>— 鏤鏖</p>
<p>在近時提倡增進生產的環境下，本報特關關　工商訪問　一欄，願以工商實業界現實情况，酌予披露，以供投資生產專業者之參考。—編者</p>
<p>在近代工業生產事業　之一，試　市塲上出售之茶葉　菓香煙顏料油漆化妝品及各種罐　食品　，無不採用此項罐聽，以其對於商品之保持整潔·增加美觀，以及　藏便利，均有相當助力，故　　事業之發達，乃為工業發　中必然之趨勢。我國製　事業，發　於廿餘年以　，迄於今日，　以康元製罐廠為此中翹楚。爰以最近訪問　得，為述於後</p>
<p>康元製繼　成立於民國十一年，原為項康原氏獨　所　　，廠址初在　口東有　路武陵里，二年後　　華　路　基二十　畝，建築　　，添置　式印刷及製罐　器，同時並實　科學管理，注意職工　練及　利問題，開我　實行科學管理之　　，民國二十二年改組為股份有限公司，二十三年設立　港分廠，並在天津　州認州　處分廠先後成立，該廠設總管理處及發行所於上海廣東路二四七號，其　　路總廠，於二十六年戰時被　，不久即在租界　妥廠址，恢復營業，現在武定路總廠之規模，堪稱相當完備，職工約三四百人，均受過嚴密的訓練。至香港以及天津，揚州，福州各分廠，亦均規模粗具。</p>
<p>按　　業之主要原料為鐵皮，大東亞戰爭爆發以後，鐵皮來源中斷，價格猛漲，較　二十六年戰前，約漲三百五六十倍，當時鐵皮亦為　制品，一切移　皆須向當局申請核准，自國府　戰後，凡在上海市內之一切買賣移動製造，均可自由辦理，以是康元營業更為活躍，記者　　閱該公司最近　　負債表，（三十二年六月底，　總計所存主要原料，如各種鐵皮油墨頗　五金雜料等。約計一千八百餘萬元，不論　　厚料，其　　價格，　照　價計算。在固定資產方面，如　　路總廠地基二十餘畝。總分廠房庫建築生　裝條工具印石運輸　具　　面上均已折存一元，亦惟表示其物質之存在而已，其餘重要　　　機器模型等，亦已提存折　準備，歷年已達百分之五十以上，該公司共有大小機器四百五十七部，賬面祗折存六十萬元，記者曾指問一部大的機器，據告市值一百五十萬元，是則祗此一部機器，已超出全廠機器之賬面價值矣；又見大號印刷機多部，據稱市值每部四十萬元，造墨機一部，市值六七十萬元；復指問玩具「飛機」一座，其模型需價幾何，據稱照市價計算，飛機模型一套，約需十二萬餘元；該公司所有製罐玩　彈子門鎖與五金　具等完好模型，共計一千三百零一　，其價值殊可驚人。該公司全部資產，倘以市值估計，則　過該公司之資本額者，實有幾十倍之多。</p>
<p>記者復訽悉該公司　經本年八月三十日股東臨時會議議決，再度增資三千萬元，連原有資本一千萬元，合爲四千萬元，分爲四百萬股。新股中有一百萬股為溢價發行股，　股　升新股一股，及認　新股一股，每股繳付國幣十元、又得認購　　股二股，　而十元，溢價四十元，其溢價所得，悉充公　公積金。由是以觀。則　原有公積金合計之。其總數　為五千餘萬元，公積金之多，實為有限公司中所　見矣。</p>

<h3 id="c49">觀崔承喜的　藝術舞 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 寒若</p>
<p>崔承喜的舞踊藝術，在日本素負盛名，此次來華，據伊向新聞界人士表示，其任務在慰勞在華日本皇軍，並表現東洋舞蹈技藝，交流中日舞踊藝術。業自前（十九日）日起假座美琪大戲院公開表演十日，演畢將往南京，繼續表演。日前在美琪所演之節目計兩部，第一部七節，第二部九節，除一部份由崔姬之學生主演外，均由崔女士個人演出，爰就觀舞之印象所及略為叙述：</p>
<p>普督菩薩以舞踊動　，面部表情，描摹菩薩的妙　，氣象壯嚴。</p>
<p>花郎舞　以西洋舞步表而出之，極盡活潑快樂之致。</p>
<p>洋的旋律　由崔女士的學生　貴　及針田　子二女士主演，表現東洋舞蹈之　有技藝。</p>
<p>妃曲　以　　君出關和番為題材，　述昭君行　　怨之狀，音樂楚楚動人。動作步伐，悲泣　　，　容表現等等，大郡摹中國京劇，　服裝配　，似不足表現明妃身份，此點殊有研究之必要，如能在明妃手中　抱一琵琶，則比較更完善美觀矣。</p>
<p>天下大將軍　爲一　　作品，舞者本身作小丑裝束，紅袍紗帽，狀頗委瑣，但於舞步中極力表現偉大自尊不可一世的氣概。募後配以效　音響，共爲　妙，吾以爲前部諸節中，在憲　及舞孜上此一節目比較是成功者。</p>
<p>天平舞　由崔姬之學生針田陽子，牧山麗子，白島　子及張貴姬四人演出，描述昇　豐收之舞踊，完全東洋曲調。　　　　第一部之最後一節，崔女士演出，似為表現　之　　　別作品、　東四洋舞於一爐。樂器亦管弦並陳，步伐疾徐有致，全身　　綫條極美，表情甚爲佚　動人，與天下大將軍舞，同屬上　之作。</p>
<p>第二部</p>
<p>武魂　此爲第二部節目中之第一節，描述日本武士道之精神與武功，着日本古武士服，執戈揮舞，曲調甚雄壯威武。</p>
<p>舞菩薩　與普　善薩異曲同功。</p>
<p>春之歌　日本男女村童之眞愛描寫，春囘大地，天眞無邪之小兒女，游戲陽光之下，眞情流露，天上人間，舞曲充滿歡愛音韻，與中國京劇小放牛相類似，係白島峯子，牧山麗子二女士演出。</p>
<p>犧牲　古　舞踊之一種，述一公主，為救大衆而犧牲一己，臨死前之心情狀，曲　　　沉痛，舞曲奏「奈何天」中嘉實　作相彷彿，但悲凄之情尤過之。</p>
<p>草笠　　朝鮮村舞滲入西洋舞之舞踊，描寫朝鮮新　少年之歡樂心情，情　快樂活潑，服裝新異，忽而快旋律，忽而慢狐步，喪現極明　愉快。</p>
<p>印度的壁畫　謂係參觀印度壁畫所得印象而作，針田陽子與牧山麗子兩女士合作、　　幽抑的拍子，演出壁畫上之種種姿勢。</p>
<p>七夕之夜　此爲描寫中國牛郞織女的故事。織女因與牛郞分離而悲袞，凄楚動人，舞姿頗有中國古裝舞風味，織女服裝不類女裝，如非執一紈扇，幾令人雌雄莫辨。</p>
<p>三個傳統的韻律　此節與第一部末一節散調相類似、同爲表現個人舞踊技藝之作，以三個傳統的韻律爲基本、溶和各種舞藝，特別表現綫條美，與　　　為表現崔女士舞　技藝之代表作。</p>
<p>長鼓舞　此為最末之一節，係朝鮮古妓女舞蹈之一種，身背長鼓，按節舞　，曲調　挑逗性。舞　與表情俱富誘惑情緒，令人與　，一曲甫終，掌聲連續不止，復再舞一次始告平息，其受人歡迎，於此可見。</p>
<p>觀崔女士之舞踊技藝，自屬不凡，伊能　東方舞與西洋舞於一　而別創一種舞法。　採中國古與舞型，滲入其間，取長眾短，集朝鮮舞·日木舞·中國古型舞·西洋舞之大成，自創一型，足見功力。關於樂器，亦不拘東西，一律採用，並能利用音響效果，摘取舞台技術而配合演出，更見聰穎。其舞具靜的美，如讀詩，如觀畫，與前番來鴻之東　歌舞又不同，喜塲面熱鬧者，則不大合口味。　女士之技藝，須在藝術氛圍中靜賞之始能領略其高超　也。</p>

<h3 id="c50">改良舟車行旅的意見 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>赴票甬售船法</p>
<p>近來　甬二地因物價高低相較頗　。以致單幫　見眾多，往來旅客擁擠不堪，所以才造成船票求過於供，產生了黑市的怪現象，雖平價船票亦有出售、丹在經售之處其人數之多，真是門廳若市，擁擠不堪，若欲購得一票，非在黎明起早預先守候實難買到矣、因此一般急需赴甬之旅客、其票不得不求購於旅行社黑市、其價格之昂貴、幾有超出票面五倍有餘，一般寒貧之士實難勝負也。</p>
<p>輪船公司因見於此，爲絕跡黑市起見，前曾在報端通告，自十月一日起，所有船票悉歸公司自理出售，不再託任何地處寄售，並購買時除規定出示本人市民證外，復另具證明書，此莫不給軋票黨的當頭棒喝也。</p>
<p>公司當局雖極力設法，一再改善售票事宜，且不畏於手續麻煩，其爲大衆而服務之宗旨，實使人欽佩，唯今後軋票黨是否能夠絕跡，猶未可預言也。</p>
<p>雖購票時須另具證明書，其手續較爲麻煩，唯軋票黨依然仍可操作　　，將軋得之票復可轉手將高價出售於人也。</p>
<p>筆者認爲欲使軋票黨永久絕跡根除的唯一方法，莫如從碼頭上收票時着手，其辦法頗爲簡明，每在輪船開航日，當旅客下船時，將在收票之際，須檢騐其市民證之姓名，　船票上所填寫之姓名是否相符，若遇有不符，則可斷定，該船票非親自公司當局所購買、定係求供於黑布也、收票者一旦遇有此種情形，應將其船票扣　、　其登輪，這樣旅客遭到此種無謂之損失後，以後赴甬時，其船票再也不求於黑市也，同時軋票黨因見於將軋得之票乏人問津，亦將不禁而自絕矣</p>
<p>按軋票黨所購得船票上之姓名，係其本人之姓名，若復韓手出售於其他旅客，其姓名定必不符，此頗易議別也。</p>
<p>這樣公司當局旣可省却另具證明書，又可絕跡黑市，市民旣減輕負担又購票簡易，登非一舉數得乎？若將來一旦實行定可勝操左券也。唯公司當局在收票時稍費時刻，手續較爲麻煩矣，想輪船　運輪事業亦是布民的旅行代步工具，該公司　爲大衆而服務，想不啻因感於手續之麻煩，而不加實行吧，以此微意供獻於輪船公司，還望遍甬　船局公司採納爲幸，事關大衆旅客切身利害，祈借貴欄一角希予刋露，　感激莫銘矣。（　承樑）</p>
<p>電序車問秩題</p>
<p>電車站畸形的擁擠，在今日已成爲一　極嚴重的交通問題，它不單不能使一般市民達到眞正的交通上的便利，並且在這異常的擁擠下極容易發生種種不幸的事情。</p>
<p>電車的票價，與其他　無止境的物價比較起來，似乎總還佔着一個較低廉的地位，本來交通是都市的命脈，應該達到經濟而又便利的原則。但目前認爲遺憾的便是經濟達到了，但便利却生了嚴重的而車輛的不數應用已成爲普遍的現象。在烈日下，在狂風中乘客像沙丁魚似的來臨。一輛車子來了，便像蜜蜂似的一擁而上、人們的叫喊聲　　　憎恨的咒罵聲，拉鐵門的響聲，同時地發出來。結果，在這混亂惶急的狀況下，推跌倒，　伴的失散……一件件地展開起來。</p>
<p>這不是一個無所謂的問題。它的層出無窮的發生，足可以影響到日後數百萬市民的健康與安全，在紊亂中皮夾的被竊是進成　手活動的好機會，老弱者的傾跌是保障市民健康與安全的大打擊。日久之後，它必然會產生種種意料不到的可怕的後果。</p>
<p>值得提出的，幸而在兆費公開前已有丁一個絕對安全合理的設施。條兩鋼桿擱在行人道上乘客排好隊，一個個上車，不得爭先恐後，　絕對禁止無理的插入、這樣才符合了便利而又經濟的原則。同時上列種種的不幸也可從此避免了。</p>
<p>上海的電車站是這樣的多希望在每個重要的車站上都能實施那種妥善的上車規則。這樣不單是對於市民的治安與健康上有了一層保障，便是在電車本身也達到它所負起便利交通的使命。（柳雁）</p>
<p>滬車西延電時</p>
<p>本埠無軌電車，十六路，是上海滬西惟一的要道，每日趁客似潮，來來往往不停，可是一到晚上。在九點半鐘，或十點鐘，車子就進廠，停止通行。於是那些小販和貧民們，無不叫苦連天，在滬西勞勃生路一帶，都是貧民的集合區，那裏有錢來坐人力車，和別的代步品呢，吾也是其中之一份子。希望電車當局。改良實行提晚進廠。使滬西交通便利爲要。（韓洪楡）</p>
<h3 id="c51">農民的呼聲 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 周劍雲</p>
<p>我是一個農家子弟，我們一家的一年生活，　全寄托在那些田地上的收獲，往年因爲年成不壊，而且農產品價格，亦隨其他一般物價一樣的高漲。故此生活亦可過去，不如一般薪水階級似的受那生活之威脅。</p>
<p>在　邑太倉因地勢上的關係，有許多地方，是不適宜種稻的，祇能種棉花。而能種稻之田，反而少數，故而敝地農人大多種棉花的。今年因爲肥料種籽價格之昻貴，故種田所下之本鈿，亦相當浩大，在種後祇要收獲好，農產品値價，那是沒有關係的，但今年則可憐得很，在棉花將要收獲前，忽然起了整正二天大風雨，將田內的棉花，風吹雨打摧殘了三分之二，現在每畝田所能收獲的花，良好者爲五十斤左右，次則祇有二三十斤不等，而且價格因受紗布之影響，一般棉花行皆不肯提高價格收買，恐怕將來亦將和紗布一樣，受登記和收買，故現百元之間，現在平均每畝四十斤計算，折合現在之價格，祇有二百八十元，姑且不去算那以前所下之肥料種籽及人工錢，單就現在還租吧，恐怕拿此半年之血汗所換來之三百元，拿來還田租猶歉不夠。</p>
<p>本來一些小數稻的收獲，如能良好收獲，則當然對我們是不無小補，但直到今日，連我們最後錢的希望亦已成了泡影，稻也起了　害，有五成以上皆是白穗，（即所　　　），現在又是收租時了，聽說今年之租賦，却相當大，那可眞使我們農人無法應付呢呢？</p>
<p>我們希望政府，以及有關當局，儘可能節範圍，視各地情形，减小租賦價，在可能內，並盼政府，對於棉花價格，略予提高，以疏農困。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Preparing for Winter Relief <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Time flies, and the scorching summer has just passed. Autumn is waning, and in the blink of an eye, harsh winter will arrive. The biting north wind, the chilling cold that penetrates to the bone, is not far off. If we close our eyes and imagine, our impoverished compatriots, without clothes or food, struggling against the howling wind, the scene is enough to stir our human compassion and sympathy, and to prompt us to give money and effort to help them.</p>
<p>Every year there is cold, every year there are impoverished compatriots. Socially conscious people, based on compassion and sympathy, initiate winter relief campaigns every year to help these impoverished compatriots barely survive the harsh winter. Therefore, organizing winter relief can be said to be a regular event, different from temporary relief efforts organized in response to some special disaster. Thus, organizing winter relief need never feel rushed; we can calmly prepare, follow a step-by-step approach, and implement relief plans.</p>
<p>Originally, relief work is part of the government's responsibility, and the government also has designated agencies to handle relief matters. Secondly, various charitable organizations in society each conduct part of the relief work according to their capabilities. Generally speaking, government relief agencies tend to be bureaucratic, circuitous, and ineffective. Charitable relief organizations, on the other hand, operate independently, lacking integrated strength and failing to achieve maximum efficiency. If the government agencies were to lead, connecting various charitable organizations, setting a clear goal for funding and distribution of relief, following the same steps, and cooperating through division of labor, then the effect of the relief efforts would certainly be better than that of scattered, uncoordinated efforts.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, we can say that organizing relief work, especially regular relief work, must first possess two conditions: first, emphasize timeliness, preparing calmly rather than rushing things; second, emphasize integrated strength, requiring close coordination between government relief agencies and social charitable organizations, and among the charitable organizations themselves, to achieve the efficiency of integrated strength.</p>
<p>Winter relief is a regular relief effort. Shanghai's winter relief, organized every year, should, in our opinion, pay attention to the two conditions mentioned above. However, reviewing last year's winter relief in this city, the government agencies, led by the municipal government, did not start organizing until the beginning of January this year. The winter relief period had, in fact, already reached the spring relief period, which was too late in time. The refugees suffering from cold and hunger due to the threat of severe winter had already missed out on the benefits of winter relief. Therefore, this year's winter relief must pay special attention to timeliness. Now that autumn is waning and harsh winter is coming soon, it is the right time to prepare. We hope that government agencies and social charitable organizations will prepare early and arrange things calmly. Here, we offer our humble opinions for social figures to discuss together:</p>
<p>First, what we must reiterate is that to improve the effectiveness of relief work, government agencies should take the leadership responsibility and establish close connections with various relief organizations. The Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association was originally a leading organization for various private charitable groups. It had achieved quite a lot in the past, but it has now been dissolved. Therefore, the work of coordination is even more necessary. We hope that the Municipal Bureau of Social Welfare will take on the leadership responsibility for this year's winter relief. In the past, relief organizations operated independently, lacking coordination, which inevitably led to some drawbacks. For example, in the distribution of clothing, there were often duplications, where people would receive clothes from one organization and then go to another organization to receive more. Cunning individuals would often sell the clothes for money, while honest people had no clothes to receive. This contradiction, caused by a lack of rigorous organization, spread in society, deterring donors. The emergence of such incidents was due to the lack of close coordination between relief organizations, allowing unscrupulous elements to exploit opportunities and use tricks. We hope that in this year's winter relief, the government agencies will lead, inviting the leaders of various organizations and relief technical personnel to hold a meeting in advance to discuss and report on their experiences, compiling very strict relief measures to absolutely prevent various contradictions and waste, so that every bit of donation is of real benefit to the recipients.</p>
<p>Second, there are roughly two types of people in need of relief: the hidden poor and the extremely poor. For the hidden poor, provide relief such as clothing, porridge, and medicine to alleviate their temporary difficulties. For the extremely poor, we must especially plan active fundamental solutions, such as small loans to give them livelihood opportunities, and relocating them to the countryside for farming, cultivating land, and self-reliance through common effort. Secondly, the poor can be further divided into two types: those who are disabled or young, who can only be taught and cared for; and those who are adults with the ability to work, who should be given work-for-relief opportunities, so that they can produce and support themselves. As for Shanghai's original charitable organizations that do not need to stay in Shanghai, such as asylums for the disabled and nursing homes, they should all be moved inland, with Shanghai responsible for raising funds.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of funding, it is not the large amounts that are difficult to raise, but whether the donations are used appropriately, and whether they can gain the trust of the donors. A total donation target should certainly be set, but relief should be organized while fundraising, using the actual achievements of the relief work as publicity to generate continuous interest from donors. Thus, even if the amount is huge, there is no fear of not finding donors. If the funds are not reaching the target, the funds should not be moved. On the one hand, administrative expenses will continue to be incurred, and the relief funds will decrease daily before the work is done. This point should be constantly noted by those who organize the relief.</p>
<p>Fourth, there are many ways to donate, but entertainment venues and large restaurants, etc., may be given special attention, taking what is not oppressive. As for the allocation, a larger proportion should be allocated to active relief projects.</p>
<p>Fifth, after the funds have been raised and the methods have been properly determined, the personnel executing the work are also extremely important. They must be enthusiastic and responsible.</p>
<p>The winter relief period is coming soon. Thinking of our impoverished compatriots, we hope that the authorities and various charitable organizations will pay attention together and prepare early, so that the results of this year's winter relief will be better than in previous years, and the impoverished compatriots will receive more real benefits than in previous years.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) — Yunnan Front, 20th: After the Japanese army began operations on the Sino-Burmese border, it had completely surrounded approximately 17,000 strong forces, including the 36th Division of the Chongqing Central Army and the newly formed 28th Division, which were gathered in the Nujiang west-central region, by the 18th. It is now in the process of annihilating them. A certain unit of the Japanese army continued to advance north in a certain area, and after occupying Xiaoduhe, it completely cut off the Chongqing army's retreat. Two assault squads of another Japanese army attacked the main forces of the Chongqing army from Gangming Lengshuigou (the key pass of Gaoligong Mountain) on both sides. Another unit of the Japanese army, transported by , also advanced along the Longchuan River and broke through a certain area. The various units of the Japanese army that departed from Myitkyina also advanced north from the vicinity of the Indo-Burmese border, crossed the Lunma Mingguang Bimou line, and occupied a certain area on the Nujiang northwest end crossing, cutting off the connection between these units and the Chongqing army stationed in India, and encircling the rear and west of the main force of the Chongqing army in a certain area, completing the first phase of the encirclement battle. It is currently continuing to carry out mopping-up operations against the Chongqing army within the encirclement. The Chongqing army, bewildered and without a way out, merged with the main force of a certain unit and attempted to cross the Nujiang River, but the 36th Division Commander Li Zhihong has lost contact with his subordinates and is attempting to retreat alone to Menggu to cross the Nujiang River, but his subordinates have lost all will to fight and the situation is extremely dire. At the same time, the residents of Guanming Baoshan and other areas are preparing to flee, fearing a Japanese attack.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) — The area surrounded by the Japanese army in the Yunnan operation is an important area on which the Chongqing side relies to recapture Burma. The irrigated areas of the Nujiang River valley and the Longchuan River valley are fertile areas that form the logistical base for Chongqing. The rice paddies in the area are about to be harvested. The loss of the area would be a fatal blow to the Chongqing regime, and the connection between the Yunnan Chongqing army and the Chongqing army stationed in India has been severed, so the joint operations by the British and Chongqing armies can be said to have come to nothing. Moreover, the Chongqing army's utilitarian operational policy of relying on the support of only a few air forces from the British and American sides has caused much dissatisfaction, so their joint operations have turned into internal strife. After the Japanese army inflicted a major blow on the Yunnan Chongqing army, it completely sealed off its attempt to open a new line of advance. The Chongqing side's resistance can be said to be a path to self-destruction.</p>

<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) — German News Agency reports: On Sunday, when German forces changed from defense to counterattack at various key points in the Apennine Mountains, they achieved a decisive victory. German forces divided the powerful American, Canadian, and British forces into three groups,西, west of the upper reaches of the Volturno River near 特拉高尼; , in the central mountains near 巴拉尼洛; and , in the northeast mountains near里巴尔尼. The decisive battle near 巴拉尼洛 is of particular importance. The British and American forces have been attempting to break through the highway from Foggia to Rome for many days. The German forces fighting in the area launched a concentrated counterattack at the right time and from a favorable position. Under the cover of effective artillery fire, the German offensive progressed rapidly, so that the town of 巴拉尼洛 and the surrounding mountains were captured by the German forces and are now being firmly defended. The广, the vast valley, is a perfect trap for the allied English and Canadian forces, causing them to suffer serious losses in manpower and material resources. After the enemy's four counterattacks were repelled, their losses increased further. The rescue strategy launched by the Canadian reserve forces near 文嘉托拉, south of the interview area, also collapsed under the concentrated defensive firepower of the German forces. At least four regiments of the English and Canadian forces were completely wiped out in this battle. German forces are fighting with a Canadian regiment northeast of the里巴尔尼 in the Apennine highway area. They captured many spoils of war and pushed the Canadian forces back several kilometers. The US Fifth Army, under General Clark, fighting in the western coastal area, abandoned and advanced toward the leading American troops in the desert area north of the Volturno River. In the eastern coastal area, the British Eighth Army under General Montgomery attempted to establish a bridgehead near 拉里诺, but was effectively attacked by the German artillery. At the same time, General Montgomery is大 at a large number of troops on the eastern slope of the Apennine Mountains, 大槪将 to cross the mountains.</p>
<h3 id="e17">German Victory in Defensive Battle on the Southern Sector of the Eastern Front; Soviet Army Pays a Heavy Price for Every Inch of Ground <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency: In an attempt to break through the German defenses, the Soviet army has shifted its main offensive to the areas northwest of Dnipropetrovsk and north of Kyiv. The Soviet army is using all available forces in these areas, concentrating especially motorized units and tank formations in the area northwest of Dnipropetrovsk, forcing the Germans to retreat about twenty kilometers to pre-prepared positions. Meanwhile, north of Kyiv, all enemy attempts to break through were thwarted by fierce German counterattacks, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. At the same time, southeast of Kryvyi Rih, the Soviet army is paying a heavy price for every inch of ground gained. In the rest of the front, all Soviet attempts to penetrate and break through the German lines were thwarted by determined German defenses or counterattacks, resulting in numerous improvements to the German positions. Another major defensive victory for the Germans was the defeat of a large-scale offensive prepared by the Soviet army south of Gomel. Although the Soviets deployed five infantry divisions and a large number of tanks, and prepared the attack with extensive artillery fire, the result was a major defeat. The Soviets only managed to create some local gaps in the German lines at a few points, but they were unable to hold their ground due to fierce German counterattacks.</p>
<p>Valiant Exploits of German Grenadiers</p>
<p>Between Smolensk and Oryol, the situation is relatively calm. The Soviet army has suffered several serious defeats in the past few days. Local fighting broke out over a hilltop position, which was captured by German grenadiers on the afternoon of October 17 and is still being held. Southwest of Trudoliubivka, along the Smolensk-Vitebsk-Torbetsk railway line, the Germans achieved another defensive victory, repelling every enemy attack after heavy artillery preparation, forcing the enemy to retreat after losing seven tanks and suffering heavy casualties. The Soviet army continues its offensive with tank formations and strong motorized units from Dnipropetrovsk. Although outnumbered, the German forces in the area are resisting bravely, repeatedly separating the leading Soviet tank units from the following infantry divisions. At the same time, German grenadiers, anti-tank gun detachments, anti-aircraft gun detachments, and artillery are working together to cut the enemy's advancing columns into several sections. The Soviet army repeatedly mobilized fresh troops to fill the gaps, with particularly heavy losses for the 170th and 219th Tank Divisions, as well as the 19th and 32nd Motorized Regiments. These units advanced too far and were either surrounded or destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e18">German Army Invents New Special Bomb <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Berlin Times reported on the morning of the 19th about a German "new powerful special bomb" and illustrated the power of the bomb with photos. The bomb was successfully tested for the first time by Herr Bähr of the German Army Ordnance Department at a weapons conference held in eastern Germany, and its performance is extremely outstanding.</p>
<p>Neville Sector Front Line Shortened</p>
<p>Between Azov Sea and Yenakiieve, the intensity of the fighting has decreased slightly. In the Melitopol area, several enemy attacks were repelled, causing numerous casualties and the loss of eleven tanks. North of Melitopol, the Soviet army launched three offensives, all of which collapsed under concentrated German defensive fire. North of Kyiv, the Soviet army advanced along a wide front with superior forces, led by heavy artillery fire. During the fighting, some Soviet troops penetrated behind the German lines, but German grenadiers quickly changed tactics, immediately counterattacking and annihilating the advancing Soviet troops. In the Prypiat River estuary area, a German tank unit recovered a lost position during a raid and surrounded and annihilated a large enemy force. North of the road from Liozno to Vitebsk, the positions seized by the Soviet army two days ago were again driven out by German tanks and infantry. Therefore, the old main battle line is once again firmly in German hands. The German army, regardless of enemy resistance, began offensive operations on the south side of the Dnepr River bend, resulting in a significant shortening and improvement of the German line. On the northern flank of the same sector, the Soviet army deployed more than five infantry brigades and one tank brigade, repeatedly attempting to penetrate the German positions.

<h3 id="e27">Indian Provisional Government to be Established Today, Chaired by Chandra Bose <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Indian Provisional Government, under the leadership of Chandra Bose, will be established on the 21st. At a time when all East Asians extend their greatest expectations and sympathy to the 400 million people of India, the establishment of the Indian Provisional Government is of great significance. This is the opinion of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun's editorial on the 20th, titled "The Establishment of the Indian Provisional Government," which strongly states that the people of East Asia believe that India can definitely achieve independence. It states in part: Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Indian Independence League and Commander-in-Chief of the Indian National Army, is undertaking a great historical mission to rescue the 400 million people of India from famine and liberate them from the life of slavery. This time, it was decided to establish the Indian Provisional Government on October 21st, with him as chairman, and to formally declare war on Britain. The entire world will understand the determination of the Indian people towards Britain. We, as East Asian nations, cannot help but sincerely celebrate Bose's vigorous determination. Now that China and Manchuria have escaped the shackles of Britain and the United States, and the two major nations of Burma and the Philippines have also become independent, Japan has given the peoples of Java, North Borneo, and Malaya the opportunity to participate in politics. The liberation of the East Asian nations is about to be completed. These facts are self-evident to the East Asian nations and the Axis Powers, and even the enemy Britain must acknowledge them. This is sufficient proof that Japan's proclaimed construction of a new order in East Asia and the complete liberation of the East Asian nations are not empty words. We would like to take this opportunity to say one more word to the Qing government and hope that they will quietly observe the above and quickly stop their acts of betraying East Asia. Although leaders such as Nehru and Nehru are being arrested by the authorities, the Indian movement is still openly unfolding anti-British movements in Calcutta and other places. We hope that the Indian Provisional Government led by Bose will rely on Bose's July statement, emphasize military organization, concentrate the two million Indians in East Asia, and engage in anti-British battles. Use this military force to carry out a national march, unite with domestic activists, overthrow the enemies Britain and the United States, and after establishing a righteous government, complete India's glorious independence.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Japan Strengthens Domestic Posture <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Thinking of the soldiers who died for their country on the front lines, we naturally realize the mission of we the people in the rear. In front of us, there is only one path—enhancing war power. The Japanese government's recent measures, "Strengthening the Domestic Posture," abandoning all perfunctory shortcomings and enhancing war power, are natural measures in today's decisive battle period. Looking back at the current situation of the belligerent countries, regardless of whether they are Axis or Allied countries, it is too late to say that they have been lost. This policy is a comprehensive plan in all aspects of enhancing war power, such as the decisive battle of administrative operations, total national mobilization, clarification of the national nature of important enterprises, strengthening of transportation, establishment of finance, wartimeization of allocation, and thoroughness of the domestic defense posture. The strengthening of the domestic posture policy has now taken complete form. No matter which item, it is an indispensable requirement at present. Although it cannot be determined which item is the most important, it can be asserted that the thorough decisive battle of administrative operation is the center of the war economy under the guidance of the state. Whether the administrative operation is appropriate or not has a significant and immediate impact on enhancing production. This policy began with "decisive battle of administrative operation," and Prime Minister Tojo also specifically emphasized this point in his announcement on the evening of September 22, from which its importance can be known. At the same time, the government's intentions can also be inferred from this.</p>
<p>The New System of Administration</p>
<p>Successive cabinets have advocated the refreshing and strengthening of administration. Most recently, the Second Konoe Cabinet proposed the New Political Structure Plan as part of the establishment of a new domestic structure to strengthen political power, reform administrative organizations, and simplify and streamline the duties of government offices. In the Third Konoe Cabinet, preparations were actively underway, and a draft was obtained. However, it had resigned when it was put into effect. In the tense atmosphere of the Pacific, the Tojo Cabinet, which was established on October 18, Showa 16, following that cabinet, regarded the establishment of a solid domestic political, economic, and other aspects as an urgent task in order to adapt to the domestic and foreign situations at the time. It followed the Konoe Cabinet's policies in this regard and was eager to implement them. On December 8 of the same year, the Greater East Asia War broke out. In order to devote the nation's total power to victory, there was no time for hesitation in organizing the domestic situation. In response to the brilliant results on the front lines, the Cabinet sought to coordinate the overall mobilization of the national administration and implement appropriate and effective policies. In order to complete this great war, it was necessary to unite the country and establish an organization that was consistent from top to bottom, like an arm directing a finger.</p>
<p>Therefore, what the Tojo Cabinet attempted was to strengthen political power and fundamentally revise the administrative organization related to it. At this time, there was a need for a large number of military and government personnel in the occupied territories in the south. The demands of this situation added a layer of stimulus to the restructuring of the administrative organization. At the regular cabinet meeting on June 19 last year, it was decided to implement the "Essentials for Simplifying and Strengthening Administration." At the cabinet meeting on July 28, the implementation plan was also decided, announcing the dismissal of personnel, with the standard being 30% for central directly affiliated agencies, 20% for local agencies, and 10% for technical agencies. At the same time, the efficiency of civil servants was improved. On August 11, the minister was able to decide on the case. On November 1, it resolutely implemented administrative simplification, established the Greater East Asia Ministry, unified central and local administration, and improved the treatment of officials. By this point, the epoch-making refreshment and strengthening of the administrative organization under the war, and the establishment of a must-win political situation for winning the long-term war, was temporarily established.</p>
<p>Simplification of Affairs</p>
<p>In the first aspect, in order to simplify the affairs, the government submitted the Wartime Administrative Special Cases Bill and the Temporary Measures Bill for Permissions and Approvals to the 81st Ordinary Diet. After a vote, it was implemented from March 18 this year. Special wartime administrative powers were also launched, and efforts were made to remove bottlenecks in production recovery. Other measures, such as the creation of a cabinet advisory system and the placement of administrative inspection systems, were also appropriate measures to enhance war power that were currently required. Finally, at the end of June, measures such as the establishment of local administrative councils were taken, and the government's efforts to establish the heat of wartime administration were clearly visible in response to the increasingly fierce war situation.</p>
<p>However, although the government has repeatedly reformed the administrative structure and refreshed its functions, there are still many shortcomings in coping with the ever-changing war situation. The government has finally decided to take this measure. The method of strengthening the domestic posture can be listed as the first "decisive battle of administrative operation." Its content includes making the execution of political affairs more sensitive, transferring authority from central agencies to local agencies, thoroughly simplifying budgets, simplifying the affairs of government agencies, especially the consolidation of permission and approval items, the permission and approval of important industries, the abolition and simplification of supervisory systems, the massive reduction of government agency personnel in the thorough simplification of administrative organizations, the unification of military officers ordering goods from important industries, the thorough correction of official discipline, and the decisive battle of the government agencies executing administrative affairs, etc. Many decisive policies have been put forward in all aspects of administration.</p>
<p>The unification of ordering, the abolition of the document supervision system, the simplification of the permission and approval system, and the correction of official discipline have long been advocated by private individuals. It cannot be predicted in what form the unification of ordering will be realized, but the competition for ordering between the army and navy has always been a problem, which has hindered the increase in the production of weapons and the improvement of their quality. In view of this, the general public fervently hopes for the government's brave and decisive measures.</p>
<p>Supervision System of Enterprises</p>
<p>The supervision system of enterprises, permissions, and approvals can be said to have been stipulated from the purpose of free economic activities in the free economic era. However, in the current situation of operating a controlled economy under state guidance, it is not only considered unnecessary, but also hinders the leap in the increase in production, so it is hoped that there will be appropriate measures. This is especially needed today when large-scale enterprise consolidation is being implemented decisively. The phrase "correcting official discipline" in wartime still seems to be just talk and has not been put into practice. The administrative guidance over the economic departments is expanding. The slackening of official discipline naturally directly creates obstacles to the enhancement of war power and will shake the loyalty of the people who are moving towards completing the holy war wholeheartedly. This is very frightening. Although officials should be blamed for their misconduct, the private operators who cause officials to commit such offenses should also be greatly self-conscious.</p>
<p>The rapid transformation of all human and material resources in every corner of the country into war power is an urgent task at hand. Therefore, the full play of the local administrative capacity can be said to be an important issue at present. At the local governor conference in July this year, Prime Minister Tojo promised to transfer authority to local agencies. The current policy is the realization of this promise. The functions of the Local Administrative Council, which was established in June and started working, have been further strengthened.</p>
<p>Transfer of Central Authority</p>
<p>The transfer of authority from central agencies to prefectures, counties, and local special agencies has already been resolutely implemented. As a result, the authority of the chairman of the Local Administrative Council, who has the right to issue instructions and 指示審判權, is expanding. In this way, the tendency for central agencies to become planning agencies and for local agencies to become executive officials will be further promoted in the future. Regarding the reorganization of administrative organizations, each agency has already obtained a draft, which will be submitted to the cabinet before September 26. After being adjusted by the Cabinet Secretary, each one will be decided after the cabinet meeting on the 28th and implemented quickly. Other measures, such as the wartimeization of the operation of administrative organizations, the thorough strengthening of the domestic defense situation, and the consolidation of affiliated groups, require the decisiveness and complete transformation of the minds of those who are responsible for their implementation. It is not a reform for the sake of reforming the organization, nor is it a consolidation for the sake of consolidation. Everything is a means to seek victory in this war. Whether it is an official, a person related to an affiliated group, or a private individual, at this time they should resolutely abandon their previous ways and return to being aware of themselves as subjects of the Japanese Empire. Whether this policy of strengthening the domestic posture can bear fruit depends entirely on this. (Reprinted from the 朝日新聞 Fourth Edition, September 25)</p>

<p>Speech by the Japanese Military Authorities</p>
<p>Second Batch of New Enemy Properties: Transfer Ceremony Held Yesterday. The highest commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai stated in his speech that the new enemy properties under the management of the Japanese Army, consisting of twenty-one enterprise-related items and thirty-one cultural-related items, are being transferred to the management of the National Government today. The interests of the enemy countries Britain and America, which had taken a hundred years and spent enormous sums of money to establish a base for aggression in East Asia, have been completely overturned with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Japanese Army has taken over all the interests of Britain and America that had exploited China in the past, and under military management, the important task of completing the Greater East Asia War will be accomplished. The entrusted managers, military managers, and accounting supervisors, who were entrusted by the Japanese Army to manage and operate the complex and diverse Anglo-American enemy properties, have devoted themselves with utmost sincerity and cooperated with the policies of the Japanese Army. The military authorities express their heartfelt gratitude for everyone's efforts. This spring, when the National Government declared war on Britain and America and rose up to strike Britain and America in unison with the Empire, it was declared that the enemy properties in China would be transferred to the management of the National Government in accordance with the policy of managing and operating the transferred enemy properties in order to strengthen the political power of the National Government and to invite and enable the National Government to actively cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the transfer of enemy properties means that today, the military management of enemy properties, through everyone's efforts, has completely eliminated Anglo-American colors and transformed them into a wartime system without hindering their functions. Therefore, we firmly believe that after these enemy properties are transferred to the management of the National Government, we will surely see the results of everyone's hard work and achieve the expected goals. Therefore, we hope that everyone will proclaim the main purpose of the national policy and handle the transfer of enemy property affairs fairly and convincingly.</p>
<p>Speech by Minister Tajiri</p>
<p>The enemy properties under the management of the highest commanders of the Army and Navy in Shanghai, consisting of twenty-one enterprise-related items and thirty-one cultural-related items, are being transferred to the management of the National Government today. Taking this opportunity, I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who has served as a military manager with utmost effort since the start of military management until today. It was an extremely difficult task to place the various interests under the control of Britain and America in the past few decades under our management in the shortest possible time, with a very small number of people, and without hindering their functions. Moreover, in the midst of the fierce changes that have occurred during this wartime, it has required painstaking effort to operate the enemy properties in such a way as to contribute to the completion of the war. However, you have been able to overcome many difficulties and strive to achieve the intended purpose. I, who have been entrusted with the responsibility of directly supervising the military management of enterprises, am immensely grateful. Today, you are relieved of your important task as military managers, but before the complete and thorough transfer of affairs is completed, I hope that you will continue to operate and manage as before, taking into consideration the instructions of the Chinese Enemy Property Management Committee. Finally, I have one more word to say: I hope that you will recognize the main purpose of transferring enemy properties and pay full attention to ensuring that there is nothing that goes against the purpose of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Response from the Military Managers</p>
<p>I am extremely honored to be designated by the authorities to represent all the managers in delivering this response. I am deeply grateful for the earnest instructions from the military authorities. Since we were designated and ordered by the authorities to manage and operate the interests of the enemy countries Britain and America in China, we have devoted ourselves wholeheartedly and always aimed to enhance our war effort, striving to fulfill our duties and praying day and night to contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, when we think of the urgent state of affairs, we realize that there are many aspects where we have fallen short. But instead of blaming us, the authorities have praised us, for which we are sincerely grateful. This time, due to the authorities' policy, the enemy properties are being transferred to the National Government to be managed and operated under the guidance of the National Government in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. Chinese economic figures are taking steps in unison with us to strike down Britain and America, which deeply inspires our determination. In the future, we will not only heed the authorities' intentions and expedite the transfer of affairs, but also cooperate with the National Government authorities and our Chinese counterparts to the extent possible, so that the operation of the transferred enemy properties will not be hindered, in order to fulfill our responsibility as military managers. We firmly believe that cooperation and harmony between China and Japan is the only way forward, besides integrating Chinese and Japanese economic figures and building a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, we will not only pay full attention to ensuring that we do not deviate from the authorities' policies in the slightest, but also pledge to strive to become a driving force for promoting Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.</p>

<p>Chairman Zhou of the New Enemy Property Management Committee Representative Zhang Sumin's thank you speech; This year in March, the friendly authorities transferred many enemy properties in Central China, North China and South China to the National Government for takeover, and today the friendly authorities are transferring fifty-two enemy properties in Central China to the National Government for takeover, this kindness, our country's government is very grateful.

Second, for the various raw materials needed by the factories in the enemy properties that we have taken over, whether in allocation or transportation, I hope that the friendly authorities will continue to assist us so that production can continue to develop.

<h3 id="e35">Soap and Match Retailers to be Divided into Two Levels; Prices and Dates Still Awaiting Official Announcement <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the allocation of soap and matches, the authorities of the 1st and 8th Districts have been actively preparing. The purchase certificates for the 1st District have already been issued, while the 8th District has not yet fully issued them due to procedural reasons. As for the date of implementation of the allocation, although there are rumors that it will be implemented from the 1st of next month, the actual exact date is still awaiting official announcement from the municipal authorities. According to inquiries from the Commercial News Agency reporter: the regulations of which retail stores will be allocated have not yet been officially announced by the authorities, but roughly, in order to facilitate the procedures, the system of cigarette allocation will be followed. Each wholesaler is designated as a retailer, and each small cigarette shop will not be issued allocation goods for sale. Retailers are divided into two levels, one is A, one is B, level A stores must pay a deposit of 15,000 yuan, level B stores must pay a deposit of 10,000 yuan, the monthly amount of allocation will be calculated according to the amount of the deposit, approximately at least fifty cases of soap, one case of matches (six bundles). As for the retail prices of retail stores, it must also be announced after the authorities decide.</p>
<p>Registration Deadline: Sales Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>After the deadline for soap and match registration, the trade has come to a standstill. Although the authorities have stipulated that goods can still be sold after the registration deadline, most cigarette stores have temporarily suspended sales and are awaiting further notice from the authorities.</p>

<p>The Great East Asia Memorial Service is scheduled to be held from November 3rd to 9th, with a grand Dharma assembly to be held at the entire Yufosi Temple on Binlang Road. Great Dharma masters from North China, Wutaishan, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, Korea, Mongolia, Tibet, India, and Burma will be invited to participate in the main Dharma assembly to transcend souls. Due to the enormous expenses involved, although it has been generously donated by various committee members and philanthropists, it is still far from sufficient. Therefore, famous Peking opera performers from the north and south will be invited to perform charity Peking opera performances at the Tianchan Stage on the 22nd and 23rd, and the four famous football teams in Shanghai, Sansheng, Donghua, Li Lian, and Lianyi, will be invited to hold charity football matches at Yiyuan on the 25th, 26th, and 27th.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Paper Industry Association previously found that the transport of incense paper to North China was obstructed when passing through customs. It specifically submitted samples of fifty-eight types of incense paper and sent a letter to the Business Coordination Committee to request clear regulations on the types of incense paper in order to facilitate circulation and benefit commercial transport. The Business Coordination Committee then forwarded the information to the Ministry of Industry for review. The Ministry of Industry has replied to the Business Coordination Committee, stating that: having approved the request for the regulation of the types of incense paper, since the previous committee has replied with truthful facts, it should be allowed free movement to provide relief. In addition to submitting the original samples to the Ministry of Finance to instruct the customs to inspect and release them, a corresponding letter should be replied for your reference. The Business Coordination Committee has replied and informed the industry association to follow up on the handling. As for copper foil paper and gold foil paper, because they contain metallic components, they must be permitted by the Business Coordination Committee before they can be moved out of the Shanghai area. The procedures for applying for a certificate of removal should be certified by the Fine Pigment and Sundries Industry Association and the Chemical Industry Joint Association respectively.</p>

<p>Following the recent convention of regional supervisory committee members by the Rice and Grain Control Committee, an informal meeting was convened with committee members from various regions. The meeting was attended by Kuan Lu-teng, Chairman of the Committee; Zhou Chun-yu, Secretary; Mr. Okada, representative of the Friendly Nation Haikou Advisor; Major Kasahara of the Glorious Army; key officers of the committee; and procurement members from various regions. Chairman Yuan first delivered a speech providing business instructions, followed by speeches from Advisor Okada representing Haikou and Major Kasahara of the Glorious Army. Finally, Secretary Zhou answered various questions regarding regulations. The meeting adjourned successfully at 6:00 PM. A joint meeting of regional directors and deputy directors has been scheduled for this morning. The procurement and distribution of rice is expected to commence immediately. The proceedings of the informal meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman's Guiding Principles</p>
<p>Chairman Yuan Lu-teng delivered a speech outlining business guidelines, stating: "Following the convention of regional supervisory committee members today, we are continuing with this informal meeting. I am grateful for everyone's continued attendance. I would like to begin by sharing a few points:</p>
<p>Shared Responsibility</p>
<p>Rice and grain are essential for both safeguarding the Greater East Asia War, which is currently underway, and maintaining civilian food supplies. Those of us managing grain administration bear a dual responsibility, both to maintain civilian food supplies and to supply military needs. Naturally, we are even more aware of the urgency and importance of this matter. The Chinese and Japanese committee members are all renowned figures of our time and possess considerable knowledge of grain administration. The regional procurement industry associations and supervisory committee members are all wealthy individuals and experts in the rice and grain business. Everyone must exert their utmost effort, be honest and open, and collaborate with all participants to fulfill their responsibilities and achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Avoid Illicit Gains</p>
<p>Rice and grain are vital for the civilian food supply and should not be treated as mere commodities to be freely bought and sold by ordinary merchants. Given the current food crisis and pressing military needs, it is even more imperative that we do not treat them as ordinary goods solely for profit. Therefore, I hope that those involved in the rice and grain business will not view this solely through the lens of business, but rather as a form of transaction. Apart from legitimate profits, they must not covet excessive gains. They must consider the national economy, civilian livelihoods, and military needs. If they do so, they will naturally obtain due benefits. Otherwise, they will not only fail to profit but may also face ruin and disgrace. Such may be the consequence of their actions.</p>
<p>Pay Fair Prices</p>
<p>Farmers toil throughout the year to harvest rice and grain. Although current grain prices are high, the prices of all goods are also high, and farmers must spend money to purchase daily necessities other than rice and grain. Therefore, despite high rice prices, the rural economy is not particularly prosperous. For this reason, when we purchase rice and grain from rural areas, we must pay the stipulated prices. Should there be any instances of private deductions, embezzlement, or manipulation of scales, we must disregard personal feelings and severely punish those responsible.</p>
<p>Close Communication</p>
<p>This committee is the central governing body, responsible for overseeing all aspects of the business, including organizational guidelines and fund allocation. However, tasks such as procurement and storage are handled by the regional offices, particularly by the regional procurement merchants. Going forward, regional procurement merchant associations must maintain close communication with the regional offices of this committee, and with the committee itself. Both formally and informally, we must maintain a cohesive and responsive network. We must address all matters swiftly and according to procedure. Should any obstacles arise, we must promptly overcome them to enhance efficiency and achieve the desired outcomes.</p>
<p>Advisor Okada's Speech</p>
<p>Advisor Okada, representing Haikou, stated: "The National Commercial Control Association was established in March of this year to manage the procurement of essential materials and control-related affairs. The procurement of rice and grain is among the most important aspects and should be managed by the Commercial Control Association.</p>
<p>Achieving Understanding</p>
<p>However, the procurement and control of rice and grain in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have been directly managed by the National Government. The Commercial Control Association has no procurement organization in these areas. As the supply of rice and grain cannot be interrupted even for a single day, the allocation of military rice for Chinese and Japanese forces and civilian rice for Shanghai and Nanjing should continue to be managed by the Ministry of Food. If the Ministry of Food were to abruptly cease procurement, it would likely hinder the smooth implementation of grain administration. Therefore, the Ministry of Food should continue procurement temporarily. Once the new harvest arrives, management will be transferred to the Commercial Control Association. An understanding has been reached with military officials from both China and Japan.</p>
<p>Smooth Transfer</p>
<p>Based on the above understanding, in early July of this year, the Ministry of Food applied to the Executive Yuan to transfer all affairs related to the procurement and control of rice and grain to the Commercial Control Association. Fortunately, with the assistance of military officials and the dedicated efforts of Chairman Yuan and other committee members, the transfer issue has been resolved smoothly. The establishment of organizations for Chinese and Japanese industry associations is gradually progressing. As a member of the preparatory committee, I am greatly gratified. Today, at the risk of overstepping my bounds, I would like to represent Senior Colonel Oka who has special achievement for this committee. I would like to briefly outline several points for consideration regarding the implementation of procurement:</p>
<p>Price Issues</p>
<p>First, regarding procurement prices, the procurement prices have been carefully determined through enthusiastic negotiations between relevant officials and rice merchants and have been announced. They fully consider the positions of producers and consumers and aim for fairness and transparency. Furthermore, the prices will not be changed within a year. Therefore, I urge everyone to advise farmers not to withhold their rice, believing that prices will increase next year. As for the actual prices farmers should receive, the price for japonica rice in Area A is 720 yuan and for indica rice is 700 yuan. Area B should follow this principle. Within Area A, the set prices should be strictly adhered to in order to protect producers. In Area B, the prices should be adjusted based on consideration to security and transportation due to its proximity to enemy territory. When procuring in remote areas, prices should not be strictly adhered to, but price increases should not be arbitrary. The prices should be based on those in Area A, meaning the same.</p>
<p>Full Assistance</p>
<p>In short, the principle is to avoid causing undue hardship to farmers. Today, all the preparatory committee members present have been designated by the Rice Control Committee's policy. Therefore, they should educate and prepare for all procurement-related matters. Given the current situation, they should temporarily sacrifice their own interests and focus on this endeavor. If they only pursue immediate profits and disregard the nation and its people, they will face divine retribution. I sincerely hope that they will work diligently and make rapid progress in the short term. Should any obstacles arise during the transportation of rice and grain, Japanese military officials will assist in removing them. Please maintain close communication at all times. Furthermore, those who work diligently in legitimate business will receive all necessary assistance. However, those who engage in improper private gains and fail to act will be subject to severe penalties by this committee.</p>
<p>Major Kasahara's Speech</p>
<p>Major Kasahara of the 1629th Unit stated: "Speaking from the perspective of the Japanese military rice procurement director, I have a few words for everyone. The key points regarding this year's rice procurement have already been discussed in detail, so I will not repeat them. Based on my previous experience in procuring rice and grain in the Changzhou area, I would like to share two or three important points with everyone:</p>
<p>Overcoming Difficulties</p>
<p>The most important aspect of procurement is to achieve success. You must have a strong sense of responsibility and an understanding. The procurement quantities for each region and county for this year's rice procurement have already been determined. Procurement personnel in each region must be responsible for procuring based on these quantities, overcoming all difficulties, not fearing hardship, not disliking small profits, and not hesitating to risk their lives. They must make a firm decision to proceed with a spirit of sacrifice. With prominent and respected figures like Mr. Teng at the center, Chinese and Japanese merchants should shake hands, cooperate with each other, and ensure the success of this year's rice procurement.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Rice Quality</p>
<p>Procurement merchants should always carefully pay attention to collecting high-quality goods. In the past, poor quality or adulterated rice has often been discovered. This is the fault of producers and handlers. Therefore, if producers or handlers are found to be adding water or mixing in sand, they should be severely punished according to the law. In addition to the quality of the rice, attention should also be paid to packaging, correct quantities, and prevention of insufficient quantities. All military and civilian rice must be strictly inspected.</p>
<p>Delivery and Transportation</p>
<p>Care should be taken regarding delivery and transportation. The large quantities for this year must be processed sufficiently in a short period. If the procedures are not handled properly, all the effort put into procuring the goods will be wasted, as they cannot be inspected, delivery will be delayed, the rice will be exposed to rain or theft, or transportation will be too slow, resulting in a surplus of rice in the producing areas but a shortage in Shanghai and Nanjing. You must take responsibility for this. To ensure smooth operation, procedures must be carried out in order. Area A has established various procedures based on past experience. Area B must follow the above procedures step by step. Do not rely on assumptions. This is very important. The above points are based on my experience, and I hope that everyone will follow the instructions of all officials and ensure the success of this year's rice procurement.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Today's Meeting of Regional Office Directors <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Rice and Grain Control Committee has determined the preparatory committee members for the regional rice and grain procurement industry associations. Procurement of rice and grain will commence soon. To supervise the directors and deputy directors of regional offices in overseeing rice and grain procurement missions by regional merchants, the committee has scheduled a joint meeting of the directors and deputy directors of regional branch offices at 10:00 AM today (the 21st) in the committee's auditorium. All Chinese and Japanese committee members will attend to discuss the guidelines.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e45">Change Makes Progress <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>There is a famous Chinese saying: "Poverty leads to change, change leads to progress." If we interpret "poverty" as "difficulty in coping," then in all matters, whether for individuals or for the nation and society, whenever there is a feeling of difficulty in coping, it is worthwhile to consider a "flexible approach" to deal with it. Therefore, in addition to supporting the government's position in the face of the severe economic fluctuations caused by the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, we have also offered several flexible solutions to remedy the difficulties faced by the financial community, which is the same idea.</p>
<p>Recently, regarding the revision of the listing principles of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, we have heard many people discussing the merits and demerits. We believe that some aspects of the principles are worthy of review and adjustment. For example, the restriction that "companies must have been established and operating for more than one year" is certainly cautious. However, what about companies that have been established for more than one year but have not achieved any results? Or what about companies that have been established for less than one year but are well-managed, trustworthy, and have a viable production plan? Because the focus of wartime production is to encourage various production enterprises, not just to support existing ones. If there are indeed emerging enterprises that contribute to wartime production, have substantial capital, and excellent performance, but are unable to gain the trust of securities investors due to the length of their operating period, would that not be regrettable? Secondly, the restriction that "the company's paid-up capital must be more than 5 million national currency (if there is an increase in capital, the increased portion must be approved by the competent authority before it can be listed)" is certainly thorough. However, can it be determined that companies with less than 5 million capital have no production capacity? Furthermore, once the increased capital has been fully paid up, it has already merged with the original capital. If the approval of the increased capital is required as a condition for listing the stock, there may be many obstacles in practice, and the possibility of abuse lies in the "favoritism" and "obstruction" that are unavoidable during the registration process. If this happens, it will not only hinder the smooth circulation of securities, but also affect the integrity of political behavior.</p>
<p>We do not believe that these opinions are nitpicking or deliberately critical; we can only see them as doubts from someone studying the facts, and the doubts are indeed based on human nature, so we specifically point them out for everyone's consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Reasons for Delay in Opening of the Stock Exchange <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange originally scheduled its official resumption of trading on the 8th of this month, but was delayed due to incomplete internal arrangements. The date for the official opening has not yet been determined. People from all walks of life are paying close attention to the opening of the stock exchange and the future trend of the stock market. A reporter specifically visited a related person yesterday morning to inquire about this matter. According to the explanation, the reasons for the delay in opening the Chinese Stock Exchange are twofold: first, the internal arrangements have not yet been completed, and second, the relevant parties are still discussing and deciding on the management policy for future operations. Given the current stock market trend, speculation accounts for more of a factor than investment. To stabilize the future stock market and strictly limit dangerous speculation, so that our nascent industry will not be implicated by the turbulence in the stock market. Before the official opening, all necessary preparations must be made. As for the current stock market, because the stock exchange has not yet opened, people are still uncertain, so it is still in a state of flux. It is still very uncertain whether the stock exchange will be able to officially open on the first of next month.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Silk Sales Gradually Becoming Active, Silk Factories Expanding Business <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Recently, after the authorities implemented the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, silk sales have gradually become active. In particular, the demand for tussah silk in Jiangbei and other inland areas has greatly increased. According to insiders, the silk factories have been sluggish for a long time. Recently, due to the gradual improvement in sales, about 60% to 70% of the silk factories in the city have resumed work, and there is a trend of continued expansion in the future.</p>
<p>Chinese Stock Trends</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks generally fell first and then rose. After opening lower, the market gradually rebounded. Both sides had powerful players who were willing to absorb the sales from the other side. Some factions were selling, and factions of cotton yarn and some others were buying. Retail investors followed the trend. Therefore, the fluctuations were large and rumors of favorable or unfavorable sales were mixed, making people uncertain. Trading was quite active. Details of each sector are described below. ◎ Textiles Yong'an Textiles rose after falling, but ultimately were still slightly lower than the previous day; Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 fell to the previous low; Zhongfang plunged significantly; Sanhe's decline was small; Rong's also declined. ◎ Department Stores Yong'an, Xinxin, and Guohuo companies all declined slightly; Underwear also declined; Yong'an and Guanghua Department Stores were flat. ◎ New Industries Zhongfa and Xinya initially fell slightly, rebounded slightly at noon, and rose slightly in the afternoon, but ultimately were still slightly lower than the previous day; Wuzhou and Xinxing were both flat. ◎ Real Estate Dachunghua Match sales increased significantly; Nanyang Tobacco Company was open; Jiu'an Industrial was even weaker; Xinya Construction fell again; China Investment was stable; Guohua Investment and Dachunghua Industrial were still softening; Jinyuan's performance was outstanding; Huafeng Enamel and Bao'an Glass were both relatively stable. ◎ Finance The mainland, Shanghai, and Zhejiang all saw smaller transactions; Jincheng and Yizhong Trust were flat. ◎ Culture The Commercial Press and the World Publishing House were closed for half a day; China alone was flat. ◎ Real Estate Linhua firmly held its original price; Xinyi and Yongxing were both slightly lower. ◎ Public Utilities Zhabei Yongxing and China Electric Power, and others were rarely traded at par.</p>
<p>Commercial News Summary ◎ Government Bonds The unified government bond market was relatively strong yesterday, because the short positions were too large, and any positive news could easily trigger a short squeeze. Yesterday, Type C initially traded flat, then gradually rose. Although the rise in the other four types (A, B, D, and E) was limited, the trend turned positive. ◎ Artificial Silk Trading was quite light yesterday. The market was weak. Lanbaofa Company had supplies, which softened sentiment. The market was weak at the opening, with prices slightly lower than the indicated price. ◎ Grain The market was mixed yesterday. Rice and grain slightly decreased after arrival, and purchase accounts increased, leading to higher prices. The sales of thick oil were relatively good, and several companies raised the prices. Oil grain was still weak because actual sales had not increased.</p>

<p>Industrial and Commercial Visit</p>
<h3 id="e48">Visit to Kang Yuan Canning Factory <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Lou Ao</p>
<p>In the current environment of promoting increased production, this newspaper has a special column "Industrial and Commercial Visit," to disclose the actual situation of the industrial and commercial sectors, and to provide reference for investors and production professionals. — Editor</p>
<p>Canning is one of the essential industries in modern industrial production. Just look at the tea, fruit, cigarettes, paints, cosmetics, and various canned foods sold in the market. All use cans, which help keep products clean, add beauty, and make storage convenient. Therefore, the development of canning industry is an inevitable trend in industrial development. The canning industry in China began to develop more than 20 years ago, and today, Kang Yuan Canning Factory is the leader in this field. The following is the result of a recent visit.</p>
<p>Kang Yuan Canning was established in 1922, originally owned by Mr. Xiang Kangyuan. The factory was initially located in Wulingli, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou. Two years later, they moved to a 20-acre site on Huajie Road, constructed factory buildings, added advanced printing and canning equipment, and implemented scientific management, paying attention to employee training and benefits, which were pioneers in implementing scientific management in China. In 1933, it was reorganized into a limited liability company. In 1934, a branch was established in Hong Kong, and branches were established in Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Fuzhou successively. The factory has a general management office and distribution office located at 247 Guangdong Road, Shanghai. The main factory on Huajie Road was destroyed during the war in 1937, but soon a factory was found in the concession and business was restored. The scale of the current main factory on Wuding Road is quite complete, with about 300 to 400 employees, all of whom have received rigorous training. The branches in Hong Kong, Tianjin, Yangzhou, and Fuzhou also have a rough scale.</p>
<p>The main raw material for the canning industry is tinplate. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the supply of tinplate was interrupted, and prices soared, about 350 to 60 times higher than before the war in 1937. At that time, tinplate was also a restricted commodity, and all transfers had to be approved by the authorities. Since the National Government won the war, all sales, transfers, and manufacturing within Shanghai can be done freely. Kang Yuan's business has become more active as a result. The reporter reviewed the company's most recent balance sheet (end of June 1943), and found that the total main raw materials in stock, such as various tinplates, inks, hardware, and sundry materials, were about 18 million yuan. Regardless of thick or thin materials, the market price is calculated at the original purchase price. In terms of fixed assets, such as the 20-acre site of the main factory on Huajie Road, the construction of the general factory buildings and warehouses, and the equipment, tools, printing stones, and transportation equipment, have been depreciated to 1 yuan. This is only to indicate the existence of the physical property. The reserves for other important equipment, machinery, and models have also been depreciated, and the accumulated depreciation has reached more than 50%. The company has a total of 457 large and small machines, depreciated on the books to only 600,000 yuan. The reporter pointed to a large machine and was told that its market value was 1.5 million yuan, so this one machine alone exceeds the book value of all the machines in the factory. I also saw several large printing presses, said to be worth 400,000 yuan each, and an ink-making machine, worth 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. I also asked about the price of a toy "airplane" model, and was told that a set of airplane models would cost more than 120,000 yuan at market prices. The company has a total of 1,301 complete models of canning, toys, bullets, door locks, and hardware tools, and their value is astonishing. If all the company's assets were estimated at market value, they would be several times more than the company's capital.</p>
<p>The reporter further learned that the company has decided to increase its capital by 30 million yuan at a special shareholders meeting on August 30, bringing the total capital to 40 million yuan, divided into 4 million shares. One million of the new shares are premium shares, with one old share for each share of the new stock. Ten yuan per share of new stock is charged, and two additional shares can be subscribed at a premium of ten yuan per share, with a premium of forty yuan. All proceeds from the premium will be used as public reserve fund. From this perspective, the total amount of existing public reserve funds is more than 50 million yuan. The large amount of public reserve funds is rarely seen in limited liability companies.</p>

<h3 id="e49">On Viewing Cui Chengxi's Artistic Dance <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Han Ruo</p>
<p>Cui Chengxi's dance art is renowned in Japan. This visit to China, according to her statement to the press, is to慰勞the Japanese Imperial Army in China and to showcase Eastern dance skills, exchanging dance arts between China and Japan. Performances began on the 19th at the Majestic Theatre for ten days, after which she will go to Nanjing to continue performing. The program performed at the Majestic Theatre the other day included two parts, the first with seven sections and the second with nine sections. Except for some parts performed by Cui's students, all were performed by Ms. Cui herself. Here is a brief description of my impressions of the dance:</p>
<p>Pudu Bodhisattva, with dance movements and facial expressions, depicts the wonderful appearance of the Bodhisattva, with a dignified atmosphere.</p>
<p>Hwarang Dance expresses Western dance steps to the fullest extent of liveliness and joy.</p>
<p>Western Melody is performed by Ms. Cui's students Zhang Gui姬 and Zhentian Yangzi, showcasing the skills of Eastern dance.</p>
<p>Fei Qu (Imperial Concubine's Song) takes the story of Zhaojun leaving the pass and marrying a barbarian as its theme, recounting Zhaojun's sorrowful journey. The music is touching and moving. The movements and steps are filled with weeping and sorrow, and the facial expressions largely imitate Chinese Peking Opera. However, the costume design seems insufficient to express the identity of Mingfei. This point requires further study. If Mingfei could hold a pipa in her hand, it would be more complete and beautiful.</p>
<p>Tianxia Dajiangjun (Great General of the World) is a humorous work. The dancer is dressed as a clown, with a red robe and gauze hat, appearing quite humble, but strives to express a great, self-respecting, and invincible spirit in the dance steps. Accompanied by sound effects simulating bugles, it is truly wonderful. I believe that among the sections of the first part, this program is more successful in terms of choreography and dance talent.</p>
<p>Tenpyo Dance is performed by Cui's students Zhentian Yangzi, Makiyama Reiko, Shiroshima Mineko, and Zhang Guiji, depicting a dance of abundant harvest, entirely in Eastern tunes.</p>
<p>The last section of the first part is performed by Ms. Cui, seemingly to showcase her unique work, combining Eastern and Western dance styles. The instruments also include both wind and string instruments. The pace is fast and slow, and the lines of the whole body are extremely beautiful. The expressions are very relaxed and moving. Along with the Tianxia Dajiangjun dance, it is a top-notch work.</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>Wu Hun (Martial Spirit) is the first section of the second part, describing the spirit and martial arts of Japanese Bushido. Dressed in ancient Japanese samurai costumes, wielding spears, the melody is very majestic and powerful.</p>
<p>Wu Pusa (Dancing Bodhisattva) achieves the same effect as Pu Du Shan Sa.</p>
<p>Spring Song depicts the true love of Japanese village boys and girls. Spring returns to the earth, and innocent children play in the sunlight, revealing true emotions. The dance music is full of joyful sounds and rhythms, similar to the Chinese Peking Opera "Little Shepherd Boy," and is performed by Ms. Shiroshima Mineko and Ms. Makiyama Reiko.</p>
<p>Sacrifice, an ancient dance, tells the story of a princess sacrificing herself to save the masses, portraying her state of mind before death. The music is solemn and painful, and the dance music resembles the "What To Do About Heaven" of Jia Shi. The sorrow is even more extreme.</p>
<p>Grass Hat is a Korean village dance infused with Western dance. It depicts the joyful mood of Korean youths, with cheerful and lively emotions. The costumes are novel and unique, with quick melodies and slow foxtrots, revealing extreme clarity and joy.</p>
<p>Indian Murals is said to be created from impressions gained from visiting Indian murals. Ms. Zhentian Yangzi and Ms. Makiyama Reiko collaborate, performing various poses from the murals with melancholic rhythms.</p>
<p>Tanabata Night depicts the story of the Chinese Cowherd and Weaver Girl. The Weaver Girl is saddened by her separation from the Cowherd, which is moving and touching. The dance postures have a Chinese ancient costume dance flavor, and the Weaver Girl's costume does not resemble female attire. If she were not holding a silk fan, it would be difficult to distinguish male from female.</p>
<p>Three Traditional Rhythms is similar to the last section of the first part, San Tiao, both showcasing personal dance skills, using three traditional rhythms as the basis, and integrating various dance skills, especially expressing the beauty of lines. It is a representative work showcasing Ms. Cui's dance skills.</p>
<p>Long Drum Dance is the last section, one of the ancient Korean courtesan dances. Wearing a long drum on her back, she dances according to the rhythm. The melody is provocative. The dance and expressions are full of seductive emotions, which are very moving. As soon as the song ends, the applause continues non-stop, and she dances it again before it subsides. Its popularity is evident from this.</p>
<p>Watching Ms. Cui's dance skills, they are indeed extraordinary. She can combine Eastern and Western dances into one, creating a new dance style. She extracts ancient Chinese dance forms and integrates them, taking the strengths of many and combining Korean dance, Japanese dance, Chinese ancient dance, and Western dance into one, creating her own style, which shows her skill. Regarding instruments, she does not adhere to East or West, using them all, and can also utilize sound effects and extract stage techniques to coordinate the performance, which is even more intelligent. Her dance has a static beauty, like reading poetry, like viewing paintings, and is different from the Dong dance troupe that came previously. Those who like lively scenes may not find it to their liking. Ms. Cui's skills must be appreciated quietly in an artistic atmosphere to truly understand her superb techniques.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Opinions on Improving Travel by Boat and Vehicle <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Selling Boat Tickets in Ningbo</p>
<p>Recently, the price differences between Shanghai and Ningbo have been quite significant. This has led to a large number of small-scale traders, causing extreme crowding of passengers traveling back and forth, resulting in an oversupply of demand for boat tickets and the emergence of a black market phenomenon. Although regular-priced tickets are also sold, the number of people at the sales points is truly overwhelming, with crowded halls. If you want to buy a ticket, you must get up early before dawn and wait in advance, otherwise it is difficult to buy. Therefore, passengers who urgently need to go to Ningbo have no choice but to purchase tickets from travel agencies on the black market, where the price is exorbitant, sometimes exceeding five times the face value, which is unbearable for the poor.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the shipping company, in order to eliminate the black market, announced in the newspapers that from October 1st, all tickets would be sold directly by the company and would no longer be consigned to any other locations. In addition to requiring the presentation of the buyer's citizen ID card, a certificate is also required, which is undoubtedly a blow to the ticket scalpers.</p>
<p>Although the company authorities have made great efforts to continuously improve ticket sales, and are not afraid of troublesome procedures, their dedication to serving the public is truly admirable. However, whether the ticket scalpers can be completely eliminated in the future remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Although a certificate is required when purchasing tickets, which makes the procedure more troublesome, ticket scalpers can still operate, transferring the tickets they have obtained and selling them to others at high prices.</p>
<p>The author believes that the only way to permanently eliminate and eradicate ticket scalpers is to start at the pier when collecting tickets. The method is quite simple. Every time a ship sails, when passengers disembark, when collecting tickets, the name on the citizen ID card must be checked to see if it matches the name written on the ticket. If there is a discrepancy, it can be determined that the ticket was not purchased directly from the company authorities and must have been obtained from the black market. Once the ticket collector encounters such a situation, the ticket should be confiscated and the passenger should be prevented from boarding the ship. After suffering such unnecessary losses, passengers will no longer seek tickets from the black market when going to Ningbo in the future. At the same time, ticket scalpers, seeing that the tickets they have obtained are unwanted, will naturally disappear.</p>
<p>The name on the ticket purchased by the ticket scalpers is their own name. If it is resold to other passengers, the names will definitely not match, which is easy to identify.</p>
<p>In this way, the company authorities can save the trouble of requiring a certificate, and the black market can be eliminated. Citizens can reduce their burden and purchase tickets easily, which is a win-win situation. If it is implemented in the future, success is guaranteed. Only the company authorities will spend a little more time collecting tickets, which makes the procedure more troublesome. However, shipping companies are also a means of transportation for the public, and the company should serve the public. It is hoped that they will not refrain from implementing this due to the troublesome procedures. I offer this humble opinion to the shipping company, hoping that the Ningbo shipping company will adopt it. As it concerns the vital interests of the public, I hope you will lend a corner of your column to publish it, and I will be extremely grateful. (Cheng Liang)</p>
<p>Electric Car Question</p>
<p>The abnormal crowding of tram stations has become a very serious traffic problem today. Not only does it fail to provide the public with true convenience in transportation, but it also easily leads to various unfortunate events under these extremely crowded conditions.</p>
<p>Compared to other endlessly rising prices, the fare for trams seems to still occupy a relatively low position. Originally, transportation is the lifeblood of a city and should achieve the principle of being economical and convenient. However, regrettably, while economy has been achieved, convenience has suffered a serious setback, and the insufficient number of vehicles has become a common phenomenon. Under the scorching sun and in the raging wind, passengers arrive like sardines. When a tram arrives, they swarm onto it like bees. People's shouts and hateful curses, and the sound of pulling iron gates, are emitted simultaneously. As a result, in this chaotic and flustered situation, people are pushed and fall, and companions are separated… one incident after another unfolds.</p>
<p>This is not an insignificant problem. Its endless occurrence can affect the health and safety of millions of citizens in the future. The theft of wallets in the chaos is a good opportunity for pickpockets to operate, and the falls of the elderly and weak are a major blow to protecting the health and safety of citizens. Over time, it will inevitably produce various unexpected and terrifying consequences.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that, fortunately, there is already an absolutely safe and reasonable facility before the rush hour begins. Two steel bars are placed on the sidewalk, and passengers line up in an orderly manner, boarding the tram one by one, without scrambling or pushing, and absolutely prohibiting unreasonable insertions. This is consistent with the principles of convenience and economy. At the same time, all the misfortunes listed above can be avoided.</p>
<p>There are so many tram stations in Shanghai, and it is hoped that such a proper boarding rule can be implemented at every important station. This will not only provide a layer of protection for the public's safety and health, but also enable the tram itself to fulfill its mission of facilitating transportation. (Liu Yan)</p>
<p>Westward Extension of Shanghai Tram Operating Hours</p>
<p>The Shanghai tram route 16 is the only major route in the western part of Shanghai. Everyday, passengers flock to it like a tide, coming and going non-stop. But at night, at 9:30 or 10:00, the trams go back to the factory and stop running. As a result, vendors and the poor alike cry out in distress. The area around Rue Robert in the western part of Shanghai is a gathering place for the poor. Where would they get the money to take rickshaws or other means of transportation? I am one of them. I hope the tram authorities will improve and implement a later closing time, so as to facilitate transportation in the western part of Shanghai. (Han Hongyu)</p>
<h3 id="e51">The Voice of the Peasants <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Jianyun</p>
<p>I am a peasant child. Our family's livelihood for the year depends entirely on the harvest from those fields. In the past, because the harvest was not bad, and the prices of agricultural products also rose like other general commodity prices, we could make a living, unlike the salary class who are threatened by the burden of living.</p>
<p>In Jiading and Taicang, due to geographical reasons, there are many places that are not suitable for growing rice, and can only grow cotton. On the other hand, there are only a few fields that can grow rice. Therefore, most of the farmers in our area grow cotton. This year, because the prices of fertilizers and seeds are expensive, the capital invested in farming is also quite large. After planting, as long as the harvest is good and the value of agricultural products is high, it does not matter. But this year, it is very pitiful. Before the cotton was about to be harvested, a heavy rainstorm suddenly occurred for two days, destroying two-thirds of the cotton in the fields. Now, the good yield per mu is only about 50 jin, and the lesser yield is only 20 or 30 jin. Moreover, due to the influence of yarn prices, general cotton merchants are unwilling to raise prices to buy it, fearing that it will be subject to registration and purchase like yarn in the future. So, the price is currently around 100 yuan. Now, calculating an average of 40 jin per mu, converted to the current price, it is only 280 yuan. Leaving aside the cost of fertilizers, seeds, and labor that were previously invested, just paying the rent now will probably be insufficient even if you take the 300 yuan earned from half a year of blood and sweat to pay the land rent.</p>
<p>Originally, if the harvest of a small amount of rice was good, it would of course be a small supplement to us. But until today, even our last hope of money has become a bubble. The rice has also suffered pests, and more than 50% are white ears (that is, what is called ""). Now it is time to collect rent, and I heard that this year's rent and taxes are quite high, which really makes it impossible for us farmers to cope.</p>
<p>We hope that the government and relevant authorities will reduce the amount of rent and tax prices as much as possible within their scope, depending on the situation in various places. We also hope that the government will slightly raise cotton prices to alleviate the farmers' difficulties.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Peishen and his brothers, magnates in the financial and industrial circles, are always very enthusiastic about public welfare. This month, the 23rd is the 70th birthday of their mother, Madam Xiang. Following her instructions, they firmly declined congratulations and specially prepared 50,000 yuan in national currency, donating it to the scholarship funds of this newspaper and Xinwen Bao, as well as the expenses of the Nanyi Nursery, etc. Gifts from relatives and friends will also be donated to the nursery, etc., to benefit relatives and friends.

<p>I recently read in your newspaper a method for "Handling Lost Children". Unfortunately, there is still a fundamental method missing, namely: "For all children who do not yet have a citizen ID card, they must sew a square cloth about two inches long and one inch wide on their left lapel, and write their name and address on it in ink, just like what Japanese elementary school students wear." In the future, if they get lost, both officials and civilians will know. "My child has already implemented this, and I feel much more at ease, because all citizens sympathize with the pain of losing a child." (Hu</p>

<p>The Shanghai Mutual Aid Unemployed Relief Group was recently established. Its purpose is purely to relieve the suffering of unemployment and achieve the goal of self-reliance and helping others. All funds are entirely collected by enthusiastic comrades and will not be raised from outside. In addition to applying to the Needlework Welfare Bureau for registration, it will first purchase ten dan of rice and issue rice tickets as a temporary relief measure. Secondly, it will purchase various daily necessities and distribute them to unemployed people who are determined to make progress, so that they can strive on their own.

<p>— Nan Ren</p>
<p>In the 21st year, I was diagnosed with apical tuberculosis in my right lung by X-ray. I am still bedridden to this day. Last year, I turned to the method of injecting air, and it has now been somewhat effective. Over these ten years, I have used countless secret recipes, and oil-soaked ginkgo is one of them. The method is to soak unpeeled ginkgo in vegetable oil, take one in the morning and evening, mash it into a paste, and take it with soy milk. However, because it was difficult for me to swallow, I only took about twenty pieces and stopped without seeing any effect. Thinking about it now, perhaps I took too little.
