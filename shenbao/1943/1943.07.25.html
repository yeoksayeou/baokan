<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>收回租界後關於法院的私義</h3>
<p>— 張一鵬</p>
<p>公共租界，已確定八月一日收回，法租界亦已決定收回，收回後的種種準備，計劃，事關國策，我們無從作具體的批評。但民間郤已議論紛紛，引起非常的關切，對於治安經濟國交敎育等重大問題，聞之茶館酒肆，見之雜志報章，即友邦有識之士，亦多抱旁觀態度，借箸代謀。獨至法院一問題，絕無論列，不可謂非百密之一疏。竊以爲政治總體，和人身相同。人身原動力全靠血液的充足，與夫骨幹的堅强，倘僅僅補血有方，而立不起，走不動，穿衣吃飯行坐把握，沒有力量支持，那末血液亦失其效用。至於敎育是滋養劑，治安是預防針，國交是輸血器，雖然缺一不可，究竟屬於後天的。經濟是政治血液，貴乎流動，法律是政治的骨幹，郤貴乎靜止，剛柔相濟，形而上學和形而下學，原則上本來是共通的。</p>
<p>如今接着說到租界的司法，也就是現在的法院。現在兩租界的法院，在公共租界，定名爲江蘇高等法院第二分院，及上海第一特區地方法院，是十九年二月國民政府派員與各國使團交涉，簽訂「關於上海公共租界內中國法院之協定」之後，於同年四月一日正式成立。在法租界，定名三分院，及上海第二特區地方法院，是二十年簽訂同樣協定，於是年八月一日正式成立。當法院未成立以前，遠溯至同治七年，兩租界司法事件，多歸華洋讞案同知一員，會同按日會審的各國領事合議問案，故曰會審公堂。雖民國十五年，曾山江蘇省政府派員與領團磋商，收回公共租界公廨，改組臨時法院，而法租界依然如故。當會審公堂時代，不但民刑不分，人民苦於訟累，會審領事，名爲陪審，實同監視，干涉判案；聲色俱厲，而且沒有判詞，案卷亦潦草不堪。自從法院成立，銳意更新，外觀自較整飭，但因爲受協定的拘束，凡刑事的拘捕偵查起訴，全爲捕房獨斷，檢察職權幾同虛設。此種畸形司法，必須積極改正，這是久經朝野一致引領而望的。</p>
<p>一鵬自光緒三十二年，迄去年十二月底止，三十八年來，公私生活，未嘗離開司法一步，雖不敢說是「識塗老馬」，郤要算一個「開路先鋒」。年逾古稀，忽見此破天荒的盛舉，甚願貢一得之愚，盡野人之曝，在下面分析綱目，簡要發抒。名曰私議，以示不在其位，不謀其政之意云爾。</p>
<p>第一綱　關於法院編制者：</p>
<p>第一目—區域—兩租界地區，原由上海縣境劃出，今已改隸上海特別市政府直轄，租界收回後，仍隸属市政府，自是名正言顺，惟现有地方法院，計有三處，與法院組織法第九條不合，自應合併爲一。倘認爲地方遼闊，依法得設分院，又高等分院計有二處，與同法第十六條不合，自應一併裁撤。在蘇州高等法院添設民刑各一庭，受理上訴案件，或併爲一高等分院，或由蘇州高等法院，別設一刑庭，常駐上海，專辦刑事上訴案件，以免人犯解送的勞費。</p>
<p>第二目—員役—三地方法院合併之後。推事員額，必可敷用，或再有餘。惟檢察官職務加强，原有三處員額，恐還不彀，是必酌量增加，然亦不至十分繁費，獨司法警察及執　員情形複雜，一方須汰弱留强，一方須妥訂章制，尤其司法警察與警局有緊密聯繫，我以爲不妨仿照日本制度，一應行政警察，均使兼司法警察職銜，每五十名爲一隊，其原有之捕房包探，擇尤派充司法警察隊長，似乎人得其用。</p>
<p>第三目—監所—監獄應與內地各監，同一編制。用地名示其區別。例如漕河涇可稱爲滬南監獄，榻樹浦可稱爲滬北監獄，視各監容納人犯的疏密，隨時分配移動，但必須另闢一外國人監房，不可混入本國人在一起，看守所最好合爲一處，倘事實上不易辦到，就原有的作爲分所，亦無不可。其監所經費應商同市政府列入預算。原來的經費來源，分別留支。這是必要事先計當定局的。</p>
<p>關於法院職權者：</p>
<p>第一目—審判—民事案件審判程序，本與內地法院相等，無甚問題。刑事案件，多由捕房律師蒞庭。代替檢察職權，租界收囘之後，起訴權屬於檢察，捕房律師，沒有陳述意見的必要，即或法院須調查辦案經過詳情，經合法傳喚，應與普通證人，同樣待遇，還有法律適用條例，聞部中已在改訂，茲不贅陳。</p>
<p>第二目—檢察—因協定的拘束，檢察官職權，縮到無事可辦，現在租界收回，協定根本取銷。且七月一日起，辦公處提升爲署，首席檢察獨立爲長，怎樣發展其效用，還被協定牽制，一旦解除，必能竭力刷新。而第一應當注意者，在實際善用指揮司法警察的特殊權力。其次則如捕房原有的解剖化驗及指模等優良成績，亦須接收保存，切勿因喧廢食。</p>
<p>關於法院風紀者：</p>
<p>第一目—禁令—官吏爲民父母，有以身作則的義務。比行政官吏爲嚴。像不准與律師同居，不准應酬交際，均爲官吏服務章程所無。租界法官，風氣漸令，爲環境所移，地方紳豪，百計聯絡，茍稍貶風骨，就容易同流合污，結果損國法之尊嚴，招外界之蜚語，及釀成巨案，縱當局執法相繩，已爲事後彌縫，收回租界之後。亟宜重申各項禁令，寗爲曲突徙薪，毋爲焦頭爛額。</p>
<p>第二目—養廉—廉潔爲官吏的要義，雖然是一般官吏所同，然司法的生命綫，却在乎此。不過官吏的廉潔，有待於國家的養成，前淸它俸之外，給以養廉銀兩，眞眞大有道理。現在法官俸給，連同公費津貼，果能顧及一家生活否！路人亦知其不可。我以爲低級法官，至少須與黃包車夫收入相等（普通車夫日獲五六十元年約二萬元）中級法官，至少須與理發匠收入相等（普通理發匠日獲七八十元年約二萬六七千元）高級法官至少須與一般商店公司經理收入相等。（月俸雖不甚高而年終花紅加薪等年約四萬元以上）而况物價高漲，無有止境，似應多養豫備費，授權院長或署長，許其隨時呈准酌增。務使生活得以維持，然後可以從容服務。這是租界收囘後急急不可少緩的事。</p>

<h3>南太平洋決戰中　日軍確立必勝態勢　美軍不惜犧牲迭次反攻受重創　損失艦艇兵員軍需資材等甚钜</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　　此間軍事專家談南太平洋方而決戰情勢稱，日美兩軍、自六月三十日以來，即以南太平洋方面倫特巴島新佐治亞島爲中心，展開決戰，其情形現已日趨激烈，敵軍雖不顧犧牲，一再竭力反攻，但日軍每决均將其擊退，而獲得光細戰果。此次迭經日大本營發表此次作戰之特徵，爲一決定雌雄之決戰，與過去僅以一戰決定勝負之戰爭。情形迴異，蓋爲雙方隨時隨地連續展開決戰。溯自六月三十日起。以迄今日，在新佐治亞方面，僅有海上作戰，但敵軍迄今已喪失巡洋艦六艘，大型逐驅艦六艘。以及其他艦艇與運輸船等三十四艘。同時並損失大批兵員及軍需資材。然該方面又將展開新戰鬥，其理由有二·一美軍此次之反攻作戰。已根據其開戰以來，迄本年五月左右。屢次決戰所獲之經騐。而放棄過去移動兵力，即艦艇及其兵員之中心主義，採取所謂「基地航空隊」主義，即使空軍駐守太平洋上各島嶼，同時並利用其空軍之攻擊力與其高速力，從速以兵員及資材運往接濟，且由夏威夷通往南太平洋外側島嶼之戰略統，最近已成爲美軍有力之反攻勢矣。二·日軍之南方戰略綫，西起馬來半島，東至所羅門羣島一綫，且其北方，包括世界有數資源地帶之東印度羣島，故已確立絕對不敗之持久態勢，並構成强而有力之勢力地帶，足可用以壓迫美軍之反攻。現日美雙方，以決戰之戰略態勢相接觸，實已暗示未來之戰鬥情勢，故甚嚴重，而日本終必操勝也。預料其情形必將更趨激烈，而更凄愴。</p>
<p>日軍在孟達前綫粉碎美反攻企圖</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電日陸軍部隊，於死守南太平洋前綫孟達之作戰中，已如日大本營所發表者，即曾屢次擊滅美軍之登陸部隊，而獲得相當戰果，但敵軍反攻企圖，仍極強頑，不斷增強陸空兩軍力量，以謀奪取孟達，因此日本海軍航空部隊，爲粉碎廠軍反攻作戰，以先發制人，不斷猛轟該處敵軍，以確保空機，如廿一日下午，日軍獲悉敵軍補給艦艇集中倫特巴港之報告時，當即飛襲該港，除轟沉敵中型運輪和艦一艘外，並猛炸敵大型運輸船，當時即擊燬其中二艘。又擊沉敵大型驅逐艦一艘，及登陸用船艇十餘艘，當日搬完成轟炸任務而飛返防地時，途中又遭遇敵機約廿架，是役日機約廿架，當即與一部敵機展開空戰，是役日機亦損失一架，日軍一方面竭力阻止敵軍之補給與增援，同時並曾在所羅門方面，以特務艦驅逐艦數艘，及援護航空部隊，從事補給與增援任務，於廿二日，又遭敵機九十四架來襲，日船團於敵機投彈如雨中，一致猛烈　　。計擊落敵機九架，是役日軍特務艦一艘，雖被炸沉沒，但已達到補給增援任務。又敵軍於六月卅日，在倫巴特島登陸以後，日海軍部隊即在新佐治亞島附近獲得莫大戰果，計擊沉敵巡洋艦六艘，大型驅逐艦六艘，魚雷艇一艘，驅逐艦一艘，運輪船九艘，特務艦一艘，擊毀敵巡洋艦二艘，驅農艦一艘，運輪船六艘，並擊落敵機三七四架，</p>
<p>東京二十四日電日陸軍航空部隊，二十一日於新幾內亞馬當南方，與敵P38型機二十架展開空戰。當即擊落其九架，是役敵機亦有三架自炸。又日機於同日並曾襲擊那索灣之敵登陸地點，猛炸敵部隊，千以極大損失，日機全部安返。</p>
<p>來京二十四日中央社電　日海軍航空部隊前曾於十九日轟炸所羅門羣島南方之敵基地挨利斯羣鳥之夫納夫基島。茲二十一日夜曾再襲該島，使敵燃料貯藏庫及數處軍事設施起火，並炸毀敵補給綫下一部，當晚敵防空燈火雖甚熾烈，　日方　無損失云。</p>
<h3>德積極增強　戰時總力體制</h3>
<p>柏林廿四日中央社電　德國自史城一役失敗以後，即奮起着手反攻，並採取決戰態勢，迄今已歷四月，各種陣容，均經整備，總力戰態勢，亦更加强。今以東綫及義大利南部戰綫戰局嚴重，復漸强化，並統一國內戰綫，俾與敵方</p>
<p>一決雌雄</p>
<p>德國政府曾於本年二月三日，根據經濟部之命令，規定封閉並整理一切不必要及不急需之商店，手工業，旅館及飲食店等，俾　出其餘剩勞力。用於軍需產業等緊急方面，自是以來，此種緊急措置，進行極爲順利，已獲得預期新果，茲德經濟部及糧食農業部，於廿二日。聯合發表部令，宣佈商店業已整理處置竣事。並說明採取此種處置後，德國中產階級對於發揮國家總力貢獻良多云。按德國中產階級頗占相當數目。故對於軍需產業、均擁有莫大之餘剩勞力。今已從此種階級中抽出浮游勞力，用於軍需工業方面，因此中產階級，決直接傾其全力，</p>
<p>增強戰力</p>
<p>德國決戰態勢之整備、亦因此而得推　。同時德國婦女亦不弱於男子，已能成爲新的勞力供給之源泉，尤以少女之勞力，在增强生產力上。貢獻良多。溯自一九四一年冬季以還，德國婦女，除担任勤勞服務半年外，又因當局樹立一戰時補助勤勞制，故總計爲國服務一年，據最近出版之「　勞服務寳鑑」載稱，此種戰時袖助勤務，自實行以來，收效宏大，對於生產力之增强、</p>
<p>頗多貢獻</p>
<p>良以婦女在軍需工廠工作直接參加者，實佔全數百分之六十，由此可知直接在軍需產業方面供給勞力之婦女，其數已急激增加。此外臨時供給勞力者，乃爲男女學生，德國各大學及各專門學校，過去向自七月底開始長期休假，直至十一月底爲止，但今年則因時局重大，故決定擔任較過去更爲澈底之勤勞義務，即除有特殊情形外，多數學生，均將遵奉學校當局之指令，暫時</p>
<p>放下筆桿</p>
<p>勢起鐵錢，進軍需工廠工作。德政府當局，不僅對學生，並且對一般國民，亦要求切勿浪費假期，並力戒勿爲健康之旅行等，而妨礙運輸工作。綜觀目下情形，可知德國於此戰局嚴重之秋，已着着强化總力戰體制，並處置整理國內戰綫，因此國內決戰色彩，更爲濃厚。即德國德民，今已努力集結其總力，以鞏固必勝不敗之體制。</p>
<h3>軸心軍西島防務　集中東北部　短期內戰力將顯示增強　英美兵力分散勢難獲逞</h3>
<p>柏林廿四日中央社電　據海通社訊海通社電事訪員塞托里斯稱，軸心軍司令部將西西里島防務，集中於該島東北部。該島西部，包括巴勒摩·馬薩拉，及特拉巴尼等大城　正在作有計劃之撤退。敵方企圖阻礙軸心軍之戰略，並截擊軸心軍，迄未獲逞，前綫中部有劇戰，加爾泰尼塞泰與恩納區城之美軍，雖以精銳進攻，但未能到達北岸。美軍在四西里島北岸山區以南，遭遇頑抗，並受重創。英美通訉社發表協約軍進抵四西里島北岸桑斯蒂法諾港之消息，殆係西西里島四南岸同名城市之誤傳，軸心軍已於前日退出該城云，西西里島束部喀泰尼亞西　及南面之戰局無變化。英軍第八軍，於上週進攻時，遭受重創後，於前日僅有砲戰，及偵察活動而已。德義砲隊予　還擊，立即獲得優勢。預料軸心軍退出西西里島西部，而在該島東北部鞏固防務後，於短時期內。必能顯示其戰鬥力之增强。而協約軍在西西里島佔領區內、必須分兵駐守，且協的軍在人力與物力方面，均頗有損失。協約軍司令部於發動對西西里島東北部之軸心軍之大規模攻勢前，必須增調援兵云。</p>
<p>柏林廿四日中央社電　據德國通訊社特派員補雷所那廿三日消息，西西里島之戰况如次，英軍及加拿大軍於略太尼亞低地北部附近，企圖突破德軍陣地受創後而敗退，因此反軸心軍似將重點置於西西里島之西部戰綫。軸心空軍廿二日於伊加的港，曾轟炸美軍軍需倉庫。使之起火。同時於吉拉港亦曾對敵軍需倉庫加以轟炸，又軸心空軍於西島東南部海岸地帶，炸沉敵貨船二艘，合計七千噸，幷炸毀西船三艘，合計一萬一千噸。於空戰中，軸心戰鬥機，擊落敵飛機七架。</p>
<p>羅馬二十四日中央社電　義軍司令部二十三日發表，軸心海空軍自七月五日至二十一日，於地中海所獲戰果如次，一擊沉敵巡洋艦一艘，驅遂艦八艘，潛水艦二艘，一重創敵巡洋艦十七艘。驅逐艦四艘。</p>
<h3>反軸心機轟炸　克裏特島　被高射砲擊落十架</h3>
<p>柏林廿四日中央社電　據　通社薩洛尼加訊，此間獲悉，協約機昨日侵入克里特島，被高射砲舉落十架，敵機乃以該島之軸心國空軍根據地及某某三大城市爲其轟炸目標，但所受損失甚微，此係協約軍進攻西西里後之第一次轟炸該島，蓋在試探軸心軍在克里特島之防務力量云。</p>
<h3>日駐義大使訪義相　呈遞東條首相文書　並就西島戰事及國際局勢舉行懇談</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日駐義大使日高氏奉重光外相訓令，二十一日上午曾訪問墨索里尼首相，送交東條首相答覆墨首相對大東亞新政策所致讚辭之文書。墨首相對之，欣然接待，前曾力言義國民對於束條首相之大束亞政策，至爲贊佩。後復就西西里島戰事及國際情勢，作種秤懇談。日外務省當局二十四日對此發表書面談話，略稱，日駐義大使日高氏，曾於七月二十一日上午訪墨索里尼首相，送交東條首相致墨索里尼首相之文書，並就時事舉行懇談。</p>
<h3>泰新聞記者團　赴昭南視察</h3>

<h3>奧勒爾突出陣地　戰事異常激烈　兩軍互調大批坦克作戰　蘇軍未獲突破德軍目的</h3>
<p>柏林廿四日中央社電　據　通社訊，海通社軍事訪員塞托里斯著稱，上週紅軍以極大壓力，加諸奥勤爾突出部，前昨二日，更向該城東面與南面續施壓迫，砲兵集中向該處轟擊，並調大隊生力軍及坦克車作戰，戰事異常激烈，雙方互有進退。但敵軍並未能達到其突破吾軍陣地之目的。德軍採取彈性防禦戰略，所予蘇軍之損失，極爲重大，此皆德軍坦克車新軍器所奏之功。前日在奧勒爾，共擊毀敵坦克車五百六十六輛，此次夏季戰爭，誠可謂爲坦克車之鬥法，雙方均出動新式坦克車，及抵禦坦克車軍器，互爭雌雄，此一戰局，目前尚未至決定之期。蘇軍在貝雨哥洛德，唐納資中游，及密烏斯前綫，績施集團進攻，但戰事並無奥勒爾方面之激烈。蘇軍迄無勝利可言。在庫壁希夫西北之突破計劃，亦未獲逞。此次夏季戰爭，蔓延至列寗格勒一帶，穗軍並不引爲驚異。蘇軍倘欲藉此牽制德軍，則屬估計錯誤矣。</p>
<p>蘇坦克隊中伏被毀</p>
<p>柏廿三日中央社電　德國新聞社軍事訪員哈瑪上校稱，星期四日德單，在東終大保衛戰中。擊毀蘇軍坦克車六百六十七輛，與飛機二百零五架，德陸軍部隊所擊毀之坦克車，不下五百六十六輛，其中大半在短射程內被擊毀。德軍平射砲之效果，爲害於敵軍者絕大。蘇軍坦克軍八十三輛。或單獨或結隊，在各據點，穿入德軍陣綫而中伏、爲德軍擲彈兵之平射砲分隊，或平射砲手之堅決行動所擊毀，或使其不能行動。另有蘇軍坦克車十三輛未受損而落入德軍手中。庫班橋頭區、蘇軍坦克車三輛，穿入德軍陣綫，開始攻擊德軍之砲位，爲德軍之重型高射砲　擊毀。此外尚有坦克車九十八輛。在庫班密烏斯中部唐納資及奥勒爾等區，爲德空軍所炸毀。德軍用機與斯多加飛機，猛攻敵軍，敵軍大潰，坦克車多輛起火焚毀，或爆炸，入晚，蘇軍僅能移去其坦克車之一部份，自東綫夏季大戰開始以來，蘇軍坦克車爲德軍所奪獲或擊毀者，幾達六千輛。此項數字，證明莫斯科對於夏季攻勢所寄之希望。何等深長。</p>
<p>蘇軍攻勢均遭擊退</p>
<p>星期四日。蘇軍司令部顯然欲在各焦點展開其所有之一切軍隊，甚至不顧最重大之犧牲，强求成功，自庫班橋頭堡直至奥勒爾地區與列寗格勒附近精强之蘇軍步兵師團，藉大批坦克車之掩護，白晨至晚，猛攻德軍之陣綫，在此大戰中，蘇軍並動用轟炸機與軍用機數百架，蘇軍雖不惜調動大批人力與重武器，但不論何處，均未能擊破德軍之防禦實力，蘇軍所攻破不重要之局部缺口非立即塡平，即加以切斷，以致蘇軍無法利用之。蘇軍經一小時以上之砲兵準備後，即以步兵三師團，與坦克車二旅之兵力，並以大批轟炸機與軍用機隊爲掩護，向庫班橋頭德軍山岳陣地，發動攻擊。在此自晨至募，不分勝負之激戰中，蘇軍之攻擊、均被擊退損失重大，某一局部缺口，爲德軍反攻所塡平，蘇軍在此損失坦克車十六輛。德軍地上守兵，擊落蘇　二十九架，其中有低飛之蘇機二架，爲機關槍火所擊落。</p>
<p>密烏斯區德軍獲勝</p>
<p>密烏斯前綫之德軍之陣綫，星期四日下午，不斷受大批蘇軍與坦克車隊襲擊，蘇軍步兵之一切攻擊，在德軍防禦砲火前，全告崩潰，僅有蘇軍坦克車一隊，在砲兵掩護之下、穿入德軍陣綫，而威脅德軍後方之聯絡但因德軍某一砲兵司令，立郎發覺局勢之危險，故能於最短時期內，集中充分之防禦武器，以對付蘇軍之坦克車隊，結果蘇軍突破德軍陣綫，恰在三十分鐘後，卽爲德軍所磯滅或被迫投降，蘇軍未受損之坦克車十八輛，落入德軍手中。同時另有坦克車三十二輛，則被毀後，棄於戰塲上。</p>
<p>德流動戰奏効甚大</p>
<p>在巾部多唐納資區，蘇軍因前數日實受重大損失，故僅能發動弱力之攻擊，而被德軍輕易擊退。星期四日，奥勒爾區之德軍陣地，屢受敵步兵與坦克車隊，來自南方東南與東北之襲擊。德軍司令部，爲儘量節省奥勒爾地區之兵力，同時並予敵以最重大之損失起見。故採取流動之戰術，奏效甚大。德軍撤退後，郎以大批坦克車隊爲掩護，作集中之反攻，在此激戰後蘇軍損失坦克車幾達四百輛之多。蘇軍企圖突破列寗格勒四周之東部陣綫，以猛烈之砲火，進攻德軍陣地，敵軍雖動用大批坦克車與軍用飛機、但終未能蹂躪德軍之陣地。德軍一師團，單獨擊毀蘇方坦克車三十輛。德軍陣綫中不重要之局部缺口，均在反攻中塡平。蘇軍在列寗格勒前綫，共損失坦克車四十五輛。德空軍在各焦點，尤其在南部與中部，協助陸軍作戰，甚爲得手。載運敵軍與戰具以及重砲的一百尊之四輪車多輛，遭炸彈與機關槍火所擊毀，子彈庫一所，與子彈車一列，以及裝甲車二列亦被炸毀。</p>

<h3>首都各界籌備　慶祝收還滬租界　汪曼雲昨接見中央社記者　談牧還租界有利清鄉工作</h3>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　上海公共租界已訂於下月一日實施交還，首都市政府布業部特行籌備「慶祝友邦交還租界，打倒英美首都民衆大會」事宜，於二十四日下午三時舉行討論會，到有各院部會及民衆各團體代表共約五十餘人，爲求進行工作之便利起見，宣傳部郭次長將主持親臨，對大會之秩序，主席團人選，會塲佈置辦事職員入數，路街彩輝等，均經詳密之檢討，即順利通過</p>
<p>南京廿四日中央社電　友邦日本交還上海公共租界，記者指就收回公共租界與淸鄉爲題，訪謁淸鄉事務局長在曼雲，承發表談話，略謂英美侵略中國，在遠東唯一的根據地，就是上海公共租界。他們利用這塊廣占三萬三千餘畝的地方，對中國施行政治，文化，經濟等等的侵略，自始及今，已達八十餘年，使中國漸决淪於次殖民地的地位，中國同胞直接簡接受其慘殺毒害的，更不知其數。故中團一日不把上海公共租界教囘，即一日得不到獨立自主。這次劃時代的大東亞戰爭，我國與友邦日本由同甘共苦的精神，進入同生共死的境地，友邦日本爲充份表現其努力援助中國，完成獨立自主的志願，首先提倡交還我國租界，撤廢治外法權，北京，天津，漢口，廣州，杭州，蘇州，厦門各處的專管租界，均已先行交遼，現在又願交還上海公共租界。我們於感奮欣慰之餘應該對日本如何表示其誠意。和平運動本是中國國民革命的再出發，目的是求中國的自由解放，進而與友邦日本共謀東亞全民族自由解放。國民政府自還都後，本欲保障和平區域，日益發展這和平區域，於前年七月閉始實施淸鄉大　，兩年以來。由江蘇而浙江，由上海而安徽，無不舉行淸鄉，今廣東與北京，亦在籌備之中，淸鄉最大的對象，就是肅淸共匪，然後地方的治安，方可確立，民生方可改善，過去在事變之前，我國各省亦曾經辦通淸鄉，然而勞民傷財，其效不舉，考其原因，莫不與上海公共租界有關，蓋一般匪首盜魁，往往匿跡租界，與內地遙爲呼應，綢繆經濟，購買槍械，密運毒品，所以內地的亂源，朱有絕跡。政府的努力終歸於無效，現在英美的勢力在東亞已經消滅，公共租界由我國收同，內地禍亂之根源已絕，此於今後上海地區的淸鄉及內地各省之淸鄉，更增加不少的便利</p>

<h3>戰時社會政策</h3>
<p>— 丁默村</p>
<p>公務員青少年暑期集訓營演講詞</p>
<p>什麼是社會政策</p>
<p>爲什麼有社會政策？原因是社會上發生了社會問題，所以需要有社會政策。那麼爲什麼有社會間題呢？可以說，世界人類愈進化，人事關係也愈複難，發生問題的可能便愈多。從外國來說，自從產業革命以後，問題便複雜起來。從中國來說，辛亥革命以後，及五四運動以來，社會問題也就複雜起來。這並不是說中國在辛亥革命五四運動以前，就沒有問題，不過是比較的少一點。無論在中國也好，在外國也好，問題的方向，總是兩個方面、即一屬於精神思想方面，一屬於物質經濟方面。普通一般所指的社會問題，完全是指物質經濟方面、簡括說一句，主要的便是吃飯問題。其他如居住·職業·工資·罷工·健康·疾病·死亡·生養·災荒等皆是。再有老弱·殘廢·婦嬰·以及雖民流離轉徒，也是社會問題的一部份。總之，所謂社會問題，凡日常生活所接觸到的問題，都可以包括在內。社會政策即是政府救濟社會的策略，補救社會上的種種弊病。</p>
<p>戰時勞働問題</p>
<p>戰時情形較平時一切都要因難，故戰時發生的社會問題，也更複雜更深刻。就歐美各國來說。平時社會問題的中心，在勞動問題，在戰時。則他們的勞動問題，亦更加嚴重。一方面是勞力不夠，一方面是勞動者階級觀念太濃厚，階級鬥爭思想太普遍，動輒要發生工潮，勞動問題，在中國似不能算普遍嚴重的問題。不過，勞動者保議，政府自然要十分的關心，已盡種種可能，舉辦一切勞動福利事業。尤其現當戰爭時期，應當以國家至上。民族至上爲基本觀念，所有階級觀念，自應消除。故對勞動者的思想方面，也努力誘導，使向正確的道路上發展。同時又協助勞資雙方解除雙方各種爭議，使勞資能切實協調，切實協力。在大束亞戰爭發生以來罷工風潮，可以說尚未發現。此係社會政策中對勞動問題的第一點。</p>
<p>又對於勞勤者的保護，尚有須補充之點，如勞工健康，工作時間，最低工資，工作保障，教靑撫卹、意工女工等一切勞動保護政策，都已予以密切的注意，根據戰時需要性和客觀條件，去施行對策，總括一句，政府對於戰時勞動問題，以消除階級鬥爭促成勞資協調爲原則，以保護勞工爲積極手段。而以增加生產·協力戰爭爲終極之目的。譬如　日合辦公司，最近由中國和日本協力，雙方已合組產業共榮會，即係本此目標共同施行的一種政策。</p>
<p>難民的救濟</p>
<p>戰爭時期，人民的流離失所，是不可避免的，這些難民遠離家鄉，生活居住，都失所憑藉，國家當然要負責救濟。所以　於難民的救濟，也是戰時社會政策中値得注意的問題。政府對此間題，曾與各方面聯絡，共同設法，一時或因經濟條件所限，不能達到預期的程度，但總是在盡着最大的努力。再有天災，例如華北各省因去年旱荒而造成的災　，即由中央　款去救濟，這也是施行社會政策中所應注意的問題。</p>
<p>推廣節約運動</p>
<p>還有最近報紙上提倡的節的運動，也是戰時救濟人民生活，和增厚國家資源的一種方法。因爲人民生活奢侈。等於浪費國家的物力，對於國家是一種無形的損失。戰時節的運動，應當擴大官傳，喚起一般民衆，儘量的節省一切物力，貢獻於國家，也就是爲國家多保持一點力量，以應付當前的戰事。我們看現在的日本德國　以至於反軸心的英美　國家，都在那裏厲行節的</p>
<p>增進國民健康</p>
<p>再有國民健康，也是社會政策之一部門，要希望一個國家强盛，必須先把一個國民都健全起來，個人體力不健全，於個人事業固無希望，對於國家的彩饗，也很重大。譬如日本方面，有專門負責體力鍛鍊的機關，來注意一般國民的體力，政府對此也設有專管的單位。誰都知道，戰時國家最要的條件，是人力和物力，故鍛鍊國民體力，可以說是現在很切要的政策。此外對於優生問題，也應當注意到，日德義諸軸心等國，對於一般　里，都有特別保護的辦法與法律，中國則正在開始辦理。保護婦孺的政策，對於國家有積極的作用，戰時尤其値得重視。</p>
<p>解決職業問題</p>
<p>在社會政策中特別關心的，還有職業問題和失業問題，這問題在中國也相當嚴重，過去學生離開學校，往往找不到職業。最近世界各國對此間題，大都設有專管機關。國府社會福利部也辦有職業指導所職業介紹所等機構。戰時職業對策，特別注意供需的調整，因爲有時需要某種人才—如軍需工業人才—不易找到，而戰時不需要的工作者—如製造奢侈品的人員等，却一時找不到職業，故政府對於職業問題，正在考慮救濟</p>
<p>舉辦社會保險</p>
<p>再有社會保險，是社會致策中的重要救濟事業。勞工和一般職業者、平時參加社會保險，一旦遇到傷害疾病失業死亡的危險，就可以得到經濟上的幫助，生活上的保障，並且兼具有促進國民儲蓄習慣的一種作用，戰時更屬需要，社會保險在意大利特別發達，各國亦早就盛行，中國過去尚未辦過，現在社會福利部正在聞始舉辦。</p>
<p>擴大合作事業</p>
<p>另外關於合作事業，也是解決社會問題的一種重要政策，合作社在日本及歐美各國，早就很發達，中國也已經有了十餘年歷史，遝都後社會部時代，曾經積極推行，現已移歸實業部主管，合作事業如能普週推行，對於一般人民及公務員生括，的確有非常大的幫助。（七月十五日）</p>
<h3>西西里島殲敵記</h3>
<p>德國各報於十七日一齊揭載德國宣傳隊員柳茲，哥霍氏的西西里島從軍記。該紀事中描述目　爲人所囑目的英國蒙高茂萊將軍與軸心軍在喀太尼亞方面之激戰情形，近代陸海空軍中使用降落傘部隊的戰况之慘烈，記戰如次：</p>
<p>敵人在利比亞，突尼四亞戰綫上業已獲得經騐，故當四西里島登陸時，即已準備絕對優勢的兵力及武器彈藥，在登陸的時候，先從海上用砲　攻擊當前的防禦，或用空軍轟炸使之沉默，在這中間乘勢設法使戰車，步兵部隊登陸。在束部西西里島登陸的紫高茂萊軍，藉激烈的海上砲擊的掩護，從希拉庫薩，奧古斯泰方面北上。至第四日，試欲衝至喀太尼亞。但軸心軍巧妙地迴避敵的砲轟，從奥古斯泰方面登陸的優勢英軍兵力，每　進一步，即與以相當的打擊，阻止沿海岸用重戰車　導向喀太尼亞進攻之蒙高茂萊軍。對此意外的軸心軍之頑强抵抗，自十三日起，至十四日夜半，突然從空中及海上向喀太尼亞南方的飛機塲加以不斷轟擊，企圖擾亂軸心軍後方陣地，並乘機從飛行塲的低空降下降落傘部隊，但這第一次降落的部隊。因適在德軍陣地的中心時値月明之夜，立即加以殲滅。不久敵人又在喀太尼亞東南降下降落傘部隊、冒猛烈的砲火創來襲擊。月明之下的空中，地上砲火的炸裂聲，飛機的引警聲，砲彈的噓噓　頭而過聲雜然並作。遙遠地從　上並傳來了陸隆的重砲聲。於是我們預期中的敵方降落傘部隊，開始落下。這時候地面上無數的　空燈在天空照耀，降落傘部隊立即被包圍於從地上發射的集中砲火中。在這中間，大部分降落傘部隊，或降落傘起火。或變成火　磨，恰如無數的火團從空中落下。在這炙熱地獄中、敵降落傘部隊全被殲滅。翌日，蒙高茂萊車乘月夜又開始突擊，這突擊隊在謀與夜間降下的降落部隊取得聯絡。但因此項降落傘部隊已告殲滅，故此次的突擊軍也因軸心軍的反攻。損失重大，而被擊退。（翔：譯自七月十七日四部朝日新聞柏林電）</p>

<h3>Private Thoughts on Courts After the Recovery of Concessions</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yipeng</p>
<p>The Public Concession has been confirmed to be recovered on August 1st, and the French Concession has also been decided to be recovered. The various preparations and plans after the recovery concern national policy, and we cannot make specific criticisms. However, the public has been discussing it, causing great concern. Regarding major issues such as public security, economy, foreign relations, and education, we hear about them in teahouses and taverns, and see them in magazines and newspapers. Even enlightened people from friendly countries are taking a bystander attitude, offering advice. However, the issue of the courts is never mentioned, which can be said to be a slight oversight. I believe that the political system as a whole is similar to the human body. The driving force of the human body relies entirely on sufficient blood and strong bones. If only the blood is replenished properly, but one cannot stand or walk, and there is no strength to support dressing, eating, sitting, and grasping, then the blood will also lose its effectiveness. As for education, it is a nourishing agent; public security is a vaccination; and foreign relations are a blood transfusion device. Although none of them can be missing, they are ultimately acquired. The economy is the blood of politics, valued for its flow; the law is the backbone of politics, valued for its stability. Flexibility and rigidity complement each other; metaphysics and physics are fundamentally interconnected in principle.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the judiciary of the concessions, which is the current court system. Currently, the courts in the two concessions, in the Public Concession, are named the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Shanghai First Special District Local Court. They were formally established on April 1st of the 19th year (1930) after the National Government sent personnel to negotiate with the diplomatic missions of various countries and signed the "Agreement on Chinese Courts in the Shanghai Public Concession" in February of the same year. In the French Concession, they are named the Third Branch and the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court. The same agreement was signed in the 20th year (1931), and they were formally established on August 1st of that year. Before the establishment of the courts, dating back to the seventh year of Tongzhi (1868), most judicial cases in the two concessions were handled by an official called the Huayang Yan'an Tongzhi, who jointly deliberated and questioned cases with the consuls of various countries on a daily basis, hence the name "Mixed Court." Although in the 15th year of the Republic (1926), the Jiangsu Provincial Government sent personnel to consult with the consular corps and recovered the public offices of the Public Concession, reorganizing the Provisional Court, the French Concession remained the same. During the Mixed Court era, not only was there no distinction between civil and criminal cases, and the people suffered from litigation burdens, but the consuls of the Mixed Court, nominally serving as jurors, were in fact acting as supervisors, interfering in the judgment of cases with stern expressions and harsh words. Moreover, there were no judgments, and the case files were also extremely sloppy. Since the establishment of the courts, they have been determined to innovate, and the appearance has naturally become more orderly. However, due to the constraints of the agreement, all criminal arrests, investigations, and prosecutions were solely decided by the police, and the prosecutorial authority was almost non-existent. This kind of deformed judiciary must be actively corrected, which has long been the unanimous hope of both the government and the public.</p>
<p>From the 32nd year of Guangxu (1906) until the end of last December, for 38 years, Yipeng has never left the judiciary in his public and private life. Although I dare not say I am an "old horse that knows the way," I should be considered a "pioneer." Now that I am over seventy years old and suddenly see this unprecedented event, I would like to contribute my humble opinion and share my superficial views. Below, I will analyze the outline and express it concisely. I call it "private thoughts" to show that I am not in a position to make policy.</p>
<p>First Outline: Regarding the Organization of the Courts:</p>
<p>First Item—Area—The areas of the two concessions were originally carved out of the Shanghai County territory. Now they have been changed to be directly under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipality. After the recovery of the concessions, it is only right and proper that they remain under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government. However, there are currently three local courts, which is inconsistent with Article 9 of the Court Organization Law. They should be merged into one. If it is believed that the area is vast, branch courts can be established according to law. There are also two high court branches, which is inconsistent with Article 16 of the same law. They should be abolished as well. One civil and one criminal division should be added to the Suzhou High Court to handle appeals, or merged into one high court branch, or the Suzhou High Court should establish a separate criminal division stationed in Shanghai to handle criminal appeals, so as to avoid the labor and expense of transporting prisoners.</p>
<p>Second Item—Personnel—After the merger of the three local courts, the number of judges will definitely be sufficient, or even excessive. However, with the strengthening of the prosecutors' duties, the original number of personnel in the three locations may not be enough. It is necessary to consider increasing it appropriately, but it will not be too expensive. The situation of judicial police and enforcement personnel is complicated. On the one hand, the weak must be eliminated and the strong retained; on the other hand, a proper system must be established. In particular, judicial police and the police bureau have close ties. I believe that it is possible to follow the Japanese system, where all administrative police also hold the title of judicial police. Every fifty people form a team, and the original police detectives should be selected and appointed as captains of the judicial police team, so that everyone can be put to good use.</p>
<p>Third Item—Prisons—Prisons should be organized in the same way as prisons in the interior, using place names to indicate their differences. For example, Caohejing can be called the Shanghai South Prison, and Tashupu can be called the Shanghai North Prison. The distribution and movement of prisoners should be adjusted according to the density of inmates in each prison. However, a separate prison room for foreigners must be established, and they cannot be mixed with domestic prisoners. It is best to combine the detention centers into one place. If it is not easy to do so in practice, the original ones can be used as branches. The prison expenses should be discussed with the Municipal Government and included in the budget. The original sources of funding should be retained for separate use. This is necessary to plan and determine in advance.</p>
<p>Regarding the Authority of the Courts:</p>
<p>First Item—Trial—The trial procedures for civil cases are the same as those of the courts in the interior, so there is no major problem. In criminal cases, police lawyers often appear in court to replace the prosecutorial authority. After the recovery of the concessions, the right to prosecute belongs to the prosecutor, and there is no need for police lawyers to express their opinions. Even if the court needs to investigate the details of the case, they should be treated the same as ordinary witnesses after being legally summoned. As for the legal application regulations, it is said that the ministry is revising them, so I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p>Second Item—Prosecution—Due to the constraints of the agreement, the prosecutorial authority was reduced to nothing to do. Now that the concessions have been recovered and the agreement has been completely abolished, and since July 1st, the office has been upgraded to a department, and the chief prosecutor is independent as the head, how to develop its effectiveness is still constrained by the agreement. Once it is lifted, it will be able to do its best to innovate. The first thing that should be paid attention to is the actual good use of the special power to command the judicial police. Secondly, the excellent achievements of the police in autopsy, chemical testing, and fingerprints should also be received and preserved, and don't abandon food because of choking.</p>
<p>Regarding the Integrity of the Courts:</p>
<p>First Item—Prohibitions—Officials are the parents of the people, and have an obligation to set an example. It is stricter than administrative officials. Like not being allowed to cohabit with lawyers, and not being allowed to socialize, are not included in the official service regulations. The atmosphere of concession judges is gradually improving, but they are influenced by the environment. Local gentry try to contact them in every possible way. If they slightly degrade their integrity, they can easily become corrupted, resulting in damage to the dignity of national law, inviting gossip from the outside world, and causing major cases. Even if the authorities enforce the law, it is only a post-event remedy. After the recovery of the concessions, it is urgent to reiterate various prohibitions. It is better to prevent problems before they occur than to be burnt out.</p>
<p>Second Item—Maintaining Integrity—Integrity is the key to being an official, although it is the same for all officials, but the lifeline of the judiciary lies in this. However, the integrity of officials depends on the cultivation of the country. In the past, the Qing Dynasty gave allowances for maintaining integrity in addition to other salaries, which was really reasonable. Now, can the salaries of judges, including public expenses and subsidies, take care of family life? Even passersby know that it is impossible. I believe that the salaries of low-level judges should be at least equal to the income of rickshaw pullers (ordinary rickshaw pullers earn 50 to 60 yuan per day, about 20,000 yuan per year); the salaries of mid-level judges should be at least equal to the income of barbers (ordinary barbers earn 70 to 80 yuan per day, about 26,000 to 27,000 yuan per year); the salaries of senior judges should be at least equal to the income of managers of general stores and companies (although the monthly salary is not very high, the annual bonus and salary increase are about 40,000 yuan or more per year). Moreover, prices are rising without end. It seems that more contingency funds should be provided, and the president or director should be authorized to increase them as needed with approval. It is necessary to ensure that life can be maintained, and then they can serve calmly. This is an urgent matter that cannot be delayed after the recovery of the concessions.</p>

<h3>In the Decisive Battle in the South Pacific, the Japanese Army Establishes a Sure Victory Posture. The US Army, Despite Sacrificing Repeated Counterattacks, Suffers Heavy Losses. Significant Losses in Ships, Personnel, Military Supplies, and Materials.</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - A military expert here, discussing the situation in the decisive battle in the South Pacific, said that the Japanese and American armies have been engaged in a decisive battle centered on Rendova Island and New Georgia Island in the South Pacific since June 30th. The situation is now becoming increasingly fierce. Although the enemy army has repeatedly tried to counterattack at the cost of sacrifice, the Japanese army has repelled them each time and achieved brilliant results. This operation, which has been repeatedly announced by the Japanese General Headquarters, is characterized as a decisive battle to determine victory or defeat, which is different from past wars where victory or defeat was determined by a single battle. The situation is different because both sides are continuously launching decisive battles anytime and anywhere. Since June 30th to this day, only naval operations have taken place in the New Georgia area, but the enemy army has lost six cruisers, six large destroyers, and thirty-four other ships and transport ships. At the same time, it has also lost a large number of personnel and military supplies. However, new battles will be launched in this area. There are two reasons: 1. The US military's counterattack operation this time is based on the experience gained from repeated decisive battles since the beginning of the war until about May of this year. It has abandoned the past mobile troop strength, that is, the centrism of ships and their personnel, and adopted the so-called "base air force" centrism, that is, stationing the air force on various islands in the Pacific, and at the same time using the attack power and high speed of its air force to quickly transport personnel and materials to supply them. Moreover, the strategic line from Hawaii to the outer islands of the South Pacific has recently become a powerful counterattack force of the US military. 2. The Japanese army's southern strategic line, starting from the Malay Peninsula in the west and extending to the Solomon Islands in the east, and its north, including the East Indies, which is one of the world's leading resource areas, has established an absolutely invincible and lasting posture, and has formed a strong and powerful sphere of influence that can be used to suppress the US military's counterattack. Now that the Japanese and American sides are in contact with each other in a decisive strategic posture, it is actually hinting at the future war situation, so it is very serious, and Japan will definitely win. It is expected that the situation will become more intense and more tragic.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Shatters US Counterattack Attempt on the Munda Front</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - As the Japanese General Headquarters announced, the Japanese army has repeatedly defeated the US landing forces in the operation to defend Munda on the front line of the South Pacific and achieved considerable results. However, the enemy army's counterattack attempt is still extremely stubborn, and it is constantly strengthening its land and air forces in order to seize Munda. Therefore, the Japanese naval air force, in order to shatter the factory army's counterattack operation, has continuously bombed the enemy army there in order to secure air superiority. For example, on the afternoon of the 21st, when the Japanese army learned of the enemy's supply ships concentrating in Rendova Harbor, it immediately launched an air raid on the harbor. In addition to sinking an enemy medium-sized transport ship, it also bombed the enemy's large transport ships. At that time, two of them were destroyed. It also sank an enemy large destroyer and more than ten landing craft. On the same day, when it completed the bombing mission and flew back to its defense area, it encountered about 20 enemy aircraft on the way. In this battle, about 20 Japanese aircraft immediately engaged in air combat with some of the enemy aircraft. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft was also lost. While the Japanese army was doing its best to prevent the enemy army's supply and reinforcement, it also engaged in supply and reinforcement missions with several special ships and destroyers, and escort air forces in the Solomon Islands area. On the 22nd, it was attacked by 94 enemy aircraft. The Japanese convoy fiercely attacked amidst the enemy aircraft's rain of bombs. A total of nine enemy aircraft were shot down. In this battle, one Japanese special ship was sunk, but it had achieved the supply and reinforcement mission. Moreover, after the enemy army landed on Rendova Island on June 30th, the Japanese naval force achieved great results in the vicinity of New Georgia Island. It sank six enemy cruisers, six large destroyers, one torpedo boat, one destroyer, nine transport ships, and one special ship. It damaged two enemy cruisers, one destroyer, six transport ships, and shot down 374 enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th - The Japanese army air force engaged in air combat with 20 enemy P38 aircraft south of Madang, New Guinea, on the 21st. It immediately shot down nine of them. In this battle, three enemy aircraft also self-destructed. On the same day, Japanese aircraft also attacked the enemy landing point in Nassau Bay, bombed the enemy troops fiercely, causing great losses. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese naval air force had previously bombed Funafuti Island in the Ellice Islands, an enemy base south of the Solomon Islands, on the 19th. On the night of the 21st, it attacked the island again, setting fire to the enemy's fuel storage depot and several military facilities, and destroying part of the enemy's supply line. Although the enemy's anti-aircraft lights were very intense that night, the Japanese side suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Germany Actively Strengthens Wartime Total War System</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - Since the failure of the Battle of Stalingrad, Germany has risen up to launch a counterattack and adopt a decisive battle posture. It has been four months since then, and various lineups have been prepared, and the total war posture has been further strengthened. Now, with the severity of the war situation on the Eastern Front and the Southern Italian Front, it is gradually strengthening and unifying the domestic front in order to compete with the enemy.</p>
<p>On February 3rd of this year, the German government, based on the order of the Ministry of Economy, stipulated the closure and reorganization of all unnecessary and non-urgent stores, handicrafts, hotels, and restaurants, etc., in order to release the remaining labor force for urgent needs such as military industries. Since then, this emergency measure has progressed very smoothly and has achieved the expected new results. On the 22nd, the German Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture jointly issued a departmental order announcing the completion of the reorganization and disposal of stores. It also explained that after taking this measure, the German middle class has contributed greatly to the development of national power. According to reports, the German middle class accounts for a considerable number, so it has a great surplus of labor for military industries. Now, floating labor has been extracted from this class and used in military industries. Therefore, the middle class will directly devote all its strength to</p>
<p>Strengthen Military Power</p>
<p>The preparation of Germany's decisive battle posture has also been promoted as a result. At the same time, German women are not weaker than men and have become a new source of labor supply. In particular, the labor of young women has contributed greatly to the increase in productivity. Since the winter of 1941, in addition to serving in labor service for half a year, German women have also served the country for a total of one year due to the establishment of a wartime auxiliary labor system by the authorities. According to the recently published "Treasury of Labor Service," this wartime auxiliary service has been very effective since its implementation and has contributed greatly to the increase in productivity.</p>
<p>Much Contribution</p>
<p>Because women directly participating in the work of military factories account for 60% of the total. From this, it can be seen that the number of women directly supplying labor in military industries has increased rapidly. In addition, the temporary supply of labor is by male and female students. In the past, German universities and specialized schools always had a long vacation from the end of July to the end of November, but this year, due to the seriousness of the situation, it has been decided to undertake more thorough labor obligations than in the past, that is, except for special circumstances, most students will follow the instructions of the school authorities to temporarily</p>
<p>Put Down Their Pens</p>
<p>And start working in military factories. The German government authorities not only require students, but also the general public, to refrain from wasting holidays, and strongly discourage health travel, etc., which may hinder transportation work. Looking at the current situation, it can be seen that Germany is strengthening the total war system in this severe autumn of the war and disposing of and reorganizing the domestic front. Therefore, the domestic decisive battle color is even stronger. That is to say, the German people are now working hard to gather their total strength to consolidate the system of sure victory and invincibility.</p>
<h3>Axis Military Defenses of Western Sicily Concentrated in the Northeast Short-term Combat Power Will Show Increase British and American Forces Divided and Difficult to Succeed</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Haitian News Agency, a reporter from the Haitian News Agency, Setholis, said that the Axis military command concentrated the defense of Sicily in the northeastern part of the island. The western part of the island, including the major cities of Palermo, Marsala, and Trapani, is undergoing a planned retreat. The enemy's attempt to hinder the Axis military's strategy and intercept the Axis military has not succeeded. There is fierce fighting in the central part of the front line. Although the American troops in the Caltagirone, Caltanissetta, and Enna regions attacked with elite troops, they failed to reach the north coast. The American troops encountered stubborn resistance south of the mountainous area on the north coast of Sicily and suffered heavy losses. The news released by the British and American news agencies that the Allied forces had advanced to the port of San Stefano on the north coast of Sicily is probably a misrepresentation of the city of the same name on the south coast of Sicily, which the Axis military withdrew from the day before yesterday. The war situation in Catania in eastern Sicily and on the southern front has not changed. The British Eighth Army, which suffered heavy losses during the attack last week, had only artillery battles and reconnaissance activities the day before yesterday. The German and Italian artillery teams counterattacked and immediately gained an advantage. It is expected that after the Axis military withdraws from western Sicily and consolidates its defenses in the northeastern part of the island, it will be able to show an increase in its combat power in a short period of time. And the Allied forces must divide their troops to garrison in the occupied areas of Sicily, and the Allied forces have suffered considerable losses in manpower and material resources. The Allied command must transfer reinforcements before launching a large-scale offensive against the Axis military in northeastern Sicily.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a message from the German News Agency special correspondent Blei, the war situation in Sicily is as follows: The British and Canadian forces attempted to break through the German line near the northern part of the plain of Catania, were wounded and retreated. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces seem to be focusing on the western front of Sicily. The Axis air force bombed the American military supply warehouse in the port of Egadi on the 22nd, causing it to catch fire. At the same time, it also bombed the enemy's military supply warehouse in the port of Gela. In addition, the Axis air force sank two enemy cargo ships with a total of 7,000 tons and destroyed three western ships with a total of 11,000 tons in the southeastern coastal area of Sicily. In the air battle, the Axis fighters shot down seven enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Rome, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters announced on the 23rd that the results achieved by the Axis naval and air forces in the Mediterranean from July 5th to 21st were as follows: 1. Sinking one enemy cruiser, eight destroyers, and two submarines. 2. Heavily damaging 17 enemy cruisers and four destroyers.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Aircraft Bomb Crete Island Ten Shot Down by Anti-Aircraft Guns</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the German News Agency in Thessaloniki, it has been learned here that Allied aircraft invaded Crete Island yesterday and ten were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. The enemy aircraft targeted the Axis air force base and the three major cities on the island as their bombing targets, but suffered very little damage. This is the first bombing of the island since the Allied forces invaded Sicily, as an attempt to probe the Axis military's defense strength on Crete Island.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles at Orel Salient: Heavy Tank Warfare Between Two Armies, Soviet Attempts Fail, German Objectives Achieved</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Tongsher [likely Reuters] report, military correspondent Setoris of the Haitong News Agency noted that the Red Army applied extreme pressure to the Orel Salient last week. Over the past two days, pressure has continued against the city's east and south, with concentrated artillery bombardment and the deployment of large numbers of reinforcements and tanks. The fighting has been exceptionally fierce, with advances and retreats by both sides. However, the enemy has failed to achieve its objective of breaking through our lines. The German army has adopted a flexible defense strategy, inflicting extremely heavy losses on the Soviets, thanks to the effectiveness of new German tank weaponry. Yesterday alone, 566 enemy tanks were destroyed at Orel. This summer's war can truly be called a tank duel, with both sides deploying new types of tanks and anti-tank weapons, vying for supremacy. The outcome of this battle remains undecided. The Soviet army continues to launch group offensives at Bei-yu-ge-luo-de, the middle reaches of the Donets River, and the Mius front, but the fighting is not as intense as in the Orel sector. The Soviet army has yet to claim any victories. Its breakthrough attempt northwest of Ku-bi-xi-fu has also failed. The spread of this summer's war to the vicinity of Leningrad does not surprise the German army. If the Soviet army intends to use this as a diversion to tie down German forces, it is miscalculating.</p>
<p>Soviet Tank Units Ambushed and Destroyed</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency military correspondent Colonel Hama reported that on Thursday the German army destroyed 667 Soviet tanks and 205 aircraft during the great eastern defensive battle. German army units destroyed no fewer than 566 tanks, most of which were destroyed at short range. The effectiveness of German direct-fire artillery is devastating to the enemy. Eighty-three Soviet tanks, either individually or in groups, penetrated German lines at various strongpoints and were ambushed, destroyed, or disabled by direct-fire artillery squads of German grenadiers or determined direct-fire gunners. Another thirteen undamaged Soviet tanks fell into German hands. In the Kuban bridgehead area, three Soviet tanks penetrated German lines and began attacking German artillery positions but were destroyed by German heavy anti-aircraft guns. In addition, 98 tanks were destroyed by the German air force in the Kuban, Mius, central Donets, and Orel areas. German aircraft and Stuka dive bombers launched intense attacks on the enemy, causing a major collapse. Many tanks caught fire and exploded. By nightfall, the Soviets were only able to remove a fraction of their tanks. Since the start of the major summer offensive on the Eastern Front, nearly 6,000 Soviet tanks have been captured or destroyed by the German army. This figure demonstrates the depth of Moscow's hopes for the summer offensive.</p>
<p>Soviet Offensives Repulsed</p>
<p>Thursday, the Soviet high command apparently intended to deploy all its forces in various focal points, even at the cost of the greatest sacrifice, in a desperate attempt to achieve success. From the Kuban bridgehead to the Orel region and near Leningrad, elite Soviet infantry divisions, under the cover of large numbers of tanks, launched fierce attacks on German lines from dawn to dusk. In this great battle, the Soviet army also deployed hundreds of bombers and warplanes. Despite the Soviet army's willingness to commit large numbers of manpower and heavy weaponry, it failed to breach German defenses anywhere. Minor, unimportant local breakthroughs were either immediately filled in or cut off, preventing the Soviet army from exploiting them. After more than an hour of artillery preparation, the Soviet army launched an attack on German mountain positions in the Kuban bridgehead with three infantry divisions and two tank brigades, covered by a large number of bombers and warplanes. In this fierce battle from dawn to dusk, the outcome was undecided; all Soviet attacks were repulsed, suffering heavy losses. One local breakthrough was filled in by a German counterattack. The Soviets lost 16 tanks in this area. German ground troops shot down 29 Soviet aircraft, including two low-flying Soviet aircraft shot down by machine-gun fire.</p>
<p>German Victory in the Mius Region</p>
<p>On the Mius front, German lines were under constant attack by large numbers of Soviet troops and tank units on Thursday afternoon. All Soviet infantry attacks collapsed before German defensive fire. Only one Soviet tank unit, under artillery cover, penetrated German lines, threatening German rear-area communications. However, a German artillery commander quickly recognized the danger of the situation and was able to concentrate sufficient defensive weapons in the shortest possible time to counter the Soviet tank unit. As a result, the Soviet breakthrough of German lines was destroyed or forced to surrender just 30 minutes later. Eighteen undamaged Soviet tanks fell into German hands. At the same time, another 32 tanks were destroyed and abandoned on the battlefield.</p>
<p>German Mobile Warfare Highly Effective</p>
<p>In the central Donets region, the Soviet army could only launch weak attacks due to the heavy losses it had suffered in previous days, and these were easily repulsed by the German army. On Thursday, German positions in the Orel sector were repeatedly attacked by enemy infantry and tank units from the south, southeast, and northeast. The German command adopted mobile tactics to conserve forces in the Orel region as much as possible, while inflicting the greatest possible losses on the enemy, which proved highly effective. After a German retreat, a concentrated counterattack was launched under the cover of large numbers of tanks. After this fierce battle, the Soviets lost nearly 400 tanks. The Soviet army attempted to break through the eastern lines around Leningrad, attacking German positions with heavy artillery fire. Although the enemy deployed large numbers of tanks and warplanes, it ultimately failed to overrun German positions. One German division alone destroyed 30 Soviet tanks. Minor, unimportant local breakthroughs in German lines were filled in during counterattacks. The Soviet army lost a total of 45 tanks on the Leningrad front. The German air force assisted the army effectively at various focal points, especially in the south and center. Many four-wheeled vehicles carrying enemy troops, war materiel, and heavy artillery, totaling one hundred, were destroyed by bombs and machine-gun fire. A munitions depot, a trainload of ammunition, and two armored trains were also destroyed.</p>

The current situation is at a turning point in the Greater East Asia War, where we are completing the revival of China and defending East Asia. It is extremely exciting that we have encountered such a great situation in our decades of life. However, the economic difficulties and hardships of today's life are also unprecedented. This situation is coming with the great situation. Enduring these difficulties and hardships is precisely the price to be paid for fulfilling the mission of a great situation. We are confident that the war will be won, and the future of reviving China and defending East Asia is infinitely bright. We are determined to practice the New National Movement, with the spirit and courage of hard work and endurance, to pay the price of the times. We must make the people understand the current situation, work hard to increase production, and we must guarantee the security of producers so that the people's strength can be inexhaustible. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government put forward the slogan of 'living and dying together.' The Greater East Asia War is related to the safety and survival of China and other East Asian countries. If we win, we will coexist and prosper together; if we fail, we will perish together. Now that the war is in progress, we must first have the determination to die together before we can enjoy the fate of living together in the future. We will continue to pay the price of the times with the spirit of hard work and endurance, which is the expression of our determination to share hardships."</p>
<h3>Capital City Circles Prepare to Celebrate the Return of the Shanghai Concession: Wang Manyun Received Central News Agency Reporter Yesterday, Discussing How the Return of the Concession is Beneficial to Clearing the Countryside</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Shanghai International Settlement is scheduled to be returned on the first day of next month. The Capital Municipal Government Cloth Industry Department is specially preparing for the "Capital City People's Congress to Celebrate the Return of the Concession by Allied Nations and Overthrow the British and Americans." A discussion meeting was held at 3:00 p.m. on the 24th. Approximately 50 representatives from various Yuan, ministries, and commissions, as well as people's organizations, attended. In order to facilitate the progress of the work, Vice Minister Guo of the Propaganda Department will personally preside over the meeting. The order of the congress, the selection of the presidium members, the layout of the venue, the number of office staff, and the decorations on the streets were all carefully reviewed and smoothly passed.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Regarding the return of the Shanghai International Settlement by allied nation Japan, the reporter interviewed Wang Manyun, director of the Clearing the Countryside Affairs Bureau, and asked about the topic of recovering the International Settlement and clearing the countryside. He stated that the only base for British and American aggression against China in the Far East was the Shanghai International Settlement. They used this place, which occupied more than 33,000 acres, to carry out political, cultural, and economic aggression against China. From beginning to end, it has been more than 80 years, making China gradually degenerate into a semi-colonial status. Countless Chinese compatriots have directly and indirectly accepted their brutal killings and harm. Therefore, China will not be independent until the Shanghai International Settlement is returned. This epoch-making Greater East Asia War has brought our country and allied nation Japan from a spirit of sharing joys and sorrows to a state of living and dying together. In order to fully demonstrate its efforts to assist China and fulfill its aspirations for independence, allied nation Japan first advocated the return of our country's concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. The special concessions in Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Xiamen have all been returned first. Now, it is willing to return the Shanghai International Settlement. In addition to feeling excited and gratified, we should show how to Japan's sincerity. The peace movement is a re-departure of the Chinese National Revolution. The purpose is to seek China's freedom and liberation, and then to jointly seek the freedom and liberation of all ethnic groups in East Asia with allied nation Japan. Since the National Government returned to the capital, it has intended to protect the peaceful areas and increasingly develop these peaceful areas. In July of the year before last, the implementation of the Great Clearing the Countryside began. For two years, clearing the countryside has been carried out in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Anhui. Now, Guangdong and Beijing are also preparing. The biggest target of clearing the countryside is to eliminate the communists. Only then can local security be established and the people's livelihood be improved. In the past, before the Incident [likely referring to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident], our country's provinces also handled clearing the countryside, but they were costly and ineffective. The reason for this is undoubtedly related to the Shanghai International Settlement. Generally, the leaders of bandits and thieves often hid in the concession and echoed the mainland from afar, planning the economy, purchasing guns, smuggling drugs, and so the source of chaos in the mainland would never disappear. The government's efforts would eventually be ineffective. Now that British and American forces have been eliminated in East Asia and the International Settlement has been recovered by our country, the root of the disasters in the mainland has been cut off. This will greatly increase the convenience of clearing the countryside in the Shanghai area and the clearing of the countryside in various provinces of the mainland in the future.</p>

<h3>Minister Chen Jian Returns to the Capital: Expresses Impressions of His Visit to Japan: Allied People Can Meet the Needs of the Wartime System: Domestic Efforts Should Assist the Government in Construction</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Minister Chen Jian of the Ministry of Construction visited Japan at the beginning of this month to inspect construction projects. He returned to Shanghai by plane from Fukuoka on the 23rd and returned to the capital from Shanghai yesterday. He expressed his impressions and experiences as follows: During my visit to Japan, I arrived in Tokyo, Osaka, and other places, and I had ample opportunity to thoroughly inspect all important agricultural, water conservancy, transportation, agricultural, and industrial aspects. In recent years, under the wartime system, the production efficiency of allied nations has been increasing daily, and the people throughout the country can directly and indirectly meet the needs of the wartime system. There are many places in various parts of China where drainage and reclamation can be carried out to increase agricultural production. We should develop them immediately. On the one hand, the government should actively promote this, and on the other hand, it is hoped that the people will do their best to assist. In addition, various construction projects that are directly and indirectly related to production are also being advanced at the same time.</p>
<h3>Wartime Social Policy</h3>
<p>— Ding Mocun</p>
<p>Speech at the Civil Servants' Youth Summer Camp Training Session</p>
<p>What is Social Policy?</p>
<p>Why is there social policy? The reason is that social problems have arisen in society, so there is a need for social policies. Then why are there social problems? It can be said that the more advanced the human race, the more complex the human relationships become, and the more possibilities for problems to arise. From a foreign perspective, problems became more complex after the Industrial Revolution. From China's perspective, social problems have also become more complex since the Xinhai Revolution and the May Fourth Movement. This is not to say that there were no problems in China before the Xinhai Revolution and the May Fourth Movement, but there were relatively fewer. Whether in China or abroad, the direction of the problems is always two-fold: one belongs to the mental and ideological aspect, and the other belongs to the material and economic aspect. The social problems generally referred to usually refer to the material and economic aspects; to put it simply, the main issue is the problem of eating. Other issues such as housing, occupation, wages, strikes, health, disease, death, childbirth, and famine are all included. In addition, the elderly, the weak, the disabled, women, infants, and refugees are also part of social problems. In short, the so-called social problems encompass all the problems encountered in daily life. Social policy is the government's strategy to help society and remedy various social ills.</p>
<p>Wartime Labor Issues</p>
<p>Wartime situations are more difficult than peacetime in all respects. Therefore, the social problems that arise during wartime are more complex and profound. Taking European and American countries as examples, the center of social problems in peacetime is the labor problem, which becomes even more serious during wartime. On the one hand, there is a shortage of labor, and on the other hand, the class consciousness of the working class is too strong, and the idea of class struggle is too prevalent, often leading to labor unrest. Labor problems do not seem to be a widespread and serious issue in China. However, the government should naturally be very concerned about the protection of laborers and has done everything possible to organize all kinds of labor welfare undertakings. Especially during the current war, the concept of the supremacy of the state and the supremacy of the nation should be the basic concept, and all class concepts should be eliminated. Therefore, efforts should also be made to guide the thinking of laborers so that they can develop in the right direction. At the same time, the government should assist both labor and management in resolving their various disputes so that labor and management can effectively coordinate and cooperate. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, labor strikes have been rare. This is the first point of social policy regarding labor issues.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are some points that need to be supplemented regarding the protection of laborers, such as labor health, working hours, minimum wages, job security, education, pensions, and policies for female workers, all of which have been closely monitored. Countermeasures are implemented based on wartime needs and objective conditions. In short, the government's principle for wartime labor issues is to eliminate class struggle and promote labor-management coordination, using the protection of laborers as a positive means, and ultimately aiming to increase production and cooperate in the war. For example, regarding the joint ventures, China and Japan have recently jointly formed the Industrial Co-prosperity Association, which is a policy implemented jointly with this goal in mind.</p>
<p>Relief for Refugees</p>
<p>During wartime, the displacement of people is unavoidable. These refugees are far from their homes, and their lives and residences have lost their reliance, so the state must be responsible for providing relief. Therefore, relief for refugees is also a noteworthy issue in wartime social policy. The government has contacted all parties to find solutions together. At times, it may not be able to reach the expected level due to economic constraints, but it is always making the greatest effort. Furthermore, natural disasters, such as the disaster caused by the drought in the northern provinces last year, were relieved by central government funding. This is also an issue that should be paid attention to in the implementation of social policy.</p>
<p>Promote Thrift Movement</p>
<p>In addition, the thrift movement recently promoted in newspapers is also a way to relieve the people's livelihood during wartime and increase national resources. Because extravagance in people's lives is equivalent to wasting the country's resources, which is an invisible loss to the country. During wartime, the thrift movement should be widely promoted to awaken the general public and save as much material resources as possible, contributing to the country, which is also to maintain a little more strength for the country to cope with the current war. We can see that countries such as Japan, Germany, and even the Allied countries of Britain and the United States are all vigorously practicing thrift.</p>
<p>Improve National Health</p>
<p>Furthermore, national health is also a part of social policy. To hope that a country is strong, it is necessary to first make the people healthy. If individual physical strength is not sound, there is no hope for individual career, and the impact on the country is also very significant. For example, Japan has a specialized agency responsible for physical training to pay attention to the physical strength of the general public, and the government also has a special unit in charge of this. Everyone knows that the most important conditions for a country in wartime are manpower and material resources. Therefore, training the physical strength of the people can be said to be a very important policy now. In addition, attention should also be paid to eugenics. Countries such as Japan, Germany, and Italy all have special protection measures and laws for the general public, while China is just beginning to implement them. Policies to protect women and children have a positive effect on the country and are particularly important during wartime.</p>
<p>Solve Employment Issues</p>
<p>Of particular concern in social policy are employment and unemployment issues. This problem is also quite serious in China. In the past, students often could not find jobs after leaving school. Recently, most countries around the world have set up specialized agencies to deal with this problem. The Ministry of Social Welfare of the National Government also has institutions such as vocational guidance centers and job placement centers. Wartime employment countermeasures pay special attention to the adjustment of supply and demand. Because sometimes there is a need for certain talents—such as talents in military industry—that are not easy to find, while workers who are not needed during wartime—such as those who manufacture luxury goods—cannot find jobs for a while. Therefore, the government is considering relief for employment issues.</p>
<p>Organize Social Insurance</p>
<p>Furthermore, social insurance is an important relief undertaking in social policy. Laborers and general workers who participate in social insurance in peacetime can get economic assistance and life security in the event of injury, illness, unemployment, or death. It also has the function of promoting the habit of national savings and is even more necessary during wartime. Social insurance is particularly developed in Italy and has long been popular in other countries. China has not yet organized it in the past, but the Ministry of Social Welfare is now starting to organize it.</p>
<p>Expand Cooperative Enterprises</p>
<p>In addition, cooperative enterprises are also an important policy for solving social problems. Cooperatives have long been very developed in Japan and European and American countries. China has also had a history of more than ten years. During the era of the Social Department, it was actively promoted and has now been transferred to the Department of Industry. If cooperative enterprises can be universally promoted, it will indeed be of great help to the lives of the general public and civil servants. (July 15)</p>
<h3>Record of Annihilation of the Enemy on Sicily</h3>
<p>On the 17th, all German newspapers simultaneously published the war diary of the German propaganda team member Lutz, Hoch of Sicily. The chronicle describes the fierce battle between British General Montgomery, who is attracting attention, and the Axis forces in the Catania area. It also describes the tragic situation of the use of paratroopers by the modern army, navy, and air force. The war is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The enemy has gained experience on the Libyan and Tunisian fronts, so when landing on Sicily, they were prepared with absolutely superior forces and weapons. When landing, they first used artillery to attack the current defenses from the sea, or bombed them with air force to silence them, taking advantage of this to try to land tanks and infantry units. The Montgomery army, which landed on the eastern part of Sicily, moved north from Syracuse and Augusta under the cover of fierce naval artillery fire. By the fourth day, they tried to break through to Catania. However, the Axis forces skillfully avoided the enemy's shelling, and the superior British forces that landed from Augusta inflicted considerable blows on every step of the advancing British forces, preventing Montgomery's army from advancing along the coast with heavy tanks toward Catania. In response to this unexpected and stubborn resistance from the Axis forces, from the 13th to the night of the 14th, they suddenly carried out continuous bombing of the airfield south of Catania from the air and sea, attempting to disrupt the rear positions of the Axis forces, and took the opportunity to drop paratroopers from low altitude above the airfield, but this first wave of paratroopers was immediately annihilated because it happened to be in the center of the German positions on a moonlit night. Soon, the enemy dropped paratroopers southeast of Catania, attacking despite fierce artillery fire. In the moonlit sky, the sound of artillery fire exploding on the ground, the sound of aircraft engines, and the whistling sound of shells passing overhead were mixed together. From afar, the sound of heavy artillery rumbled. Then, the enemy's paratroopers that we had expected began to fall. At this time, countless searchlights on the ground shone in the sky, and the paratroopers were immediately surrounded by concentrated artillery fire launched from the ground. In the middle of this, most of the paratroopers either had their parachutes on fire, or turned into fireballs, just like countless fireballs falling from the sky. In this scorching hell, the enemy paratroopers were completely annihilated. The next day, Montgomery's vehicles launched another assault under the moonlight, attempting to make contact with the paratroopers who had landed at night. However, because the paratroopers had been annihilated, the assault force was repulsed due to the Axis forces' counterattack and suffered heavy losses.

<h3>Edible Oil Supply to Be Handled by Oil and Grain Committee - Oil Factories Increase Production</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Oil and Grain Professional Committee has been actively starting work and has developed a detailed plan for future oil and grain regulation and submitted it to the authorities. The rationing of edible oil in this city was originally the responsibility of the military distribution group. It is now heard that starting next month, it will be transferred to the Oil and Grain Professional Committee. However, the per capita oil distribution will continue and will not change. Currently, in order to ensure a sufficient supply, the Oil and Grain Committee is actively purchasing and transporting large quantities of edible oil from North China and is trying to transport it to Shanghai in succession.</p>
<p>Another message, since the implementation of the rationing system by the Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office in this province, it has been four periods so far, and the results have been quite good. However, all sectors are eagerly expecting an increase in quantity. A Commercial News reporter recently learned from authoritative sources in the industry that the oil factories in this city are currently trying to increase production, using military-distributed oil-pressing raw materials and purchasing raw materials from production areas to seek ample output. Currently, a large batch of raw materials has arrived in Shanghai from Manchuria, and a small amount has also arrived from North China. The oil factories currently in operation include Yoshida, Wanggu, Rihua, Coating, Chuannan, Oil, Lisheng, and Taishan. There are also Dayouyu and Dade Xin 2 companies that will soon start operating.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stock trading was quite lively on Saturday. The momentum of resuming exchange operations boosted　 the morale of all parties. New buyers were active, and those who had sold in the past three days resumed buying. Sellers raised prices, and the rise was electric, with some stocks reaching unprecedented highs. In the cultural industry, World Book Company rose the most strongly. Commercial Press and China Press each created peaks. Yongxiang Printing had news of capital increase, and buyers continued to purchase it. The department store industry 　　was also strong, and Wing On, Sincere, and China Goods　 each broke through. The Li'an Department Store soared four levels immediately. Underwear made a sudden leap, and Jingfu socks rose sharply. Jinglun was firm and persistent. The textile industry accelerated its rise at noon. It rose a hundred points　. It was still rising in the afternoon. Xin　, Rongfeng, Xinfeng, Guoguang, Guoxin, Greater China Weaving, and Zhen　 Cotton Weaving all rose steadily. Hongsheng Weaving was difficult to buy after going out of the gate. The rise in Xinle Industry was the most　. China-France rose two levels in a row in the news of interest on investment rights. Xin Asia also rose 　. Xinyi and others also progressed quickly. Nanyang Tobacco also rose two levels in a row. Greater China Match rose slowly. The number of tickets for Jubei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric in the public utilities industry was so large that it was difficult to collect and dissolve. Some colleagues have stopped trading, and the market price is also rising. Jiu'an Industrial came out of the gate again, the buying price of China and Guohua Investment and New Asia Construction was rising day by day, New Benefit and Lian Real Estate rose sharply, Chinese Wood Industry, Fumin Dairy, Defeng Knitting, Chinese Brick and Tile, and Huafeng Enamel were searched by people, 　Yuan system　 was seen being raised again. The long-calm Jimin Food was suddenly favored by new investors, and the promotion was strong. Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving New Shares, which is about to debut tomorrow, has a complete equipment and a magnificent scale. It is heard that 80% to 90% of the 40 million yuan of capital is held by major shareholders. There are very few tradable shares. Investors can't find a way to search, and the price has exceeded several times the face value, and it is still not easy to enter.</p>
<p>Also, 　Jingfu Shirt Factory has recently purchased the original site on Xujiahui Road to build a brand-new factory building. Because the factory stores a lot of yarn, the profits are huge. Therefore, the factory's stock has jumped to a major level and has received the favor of investment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's First Orphanage: A Tour of the Tushanwan Orphanage (Part 1) Taking Tram No. 2 of the French Concession westward until you reach Xujiahui Station, get off and walk out of the "wire fence." Turn left, and you will see the Pu River, commonly known as Caojiabang. Along the river is a long gravel road. After walking several hundred paces, you will see a paifang (archway) with the characters "Tushanwan" written on it. Inside, on the whitewashed wall, is the Latin inscription "Tou-se-we." This is Shanghai's first orphanage—the Tushan Orphanage in Xujiahui, Shanghai.</h3>
<p>A Legendary History</p>
<p>At the southern end of Xujiahui, there used to be an earthen hill. It was probably formed by the accumulation of earth due to the terrain and human activities. People in Shanghai rarely saw real mountains, so they exaggeratedly called it a mountain. To the southeast of this hill, the Pu River flowed meanderingly. The villagers combined the earthen hill and the winding water to name it Tushanwan. Since the opening of the orphanage, the earthen hill has been leveled, and buildings have been erected. Today, on both banks of the Pu River stand magnificent buildings: a Catholic church, an astronomical observatory, a seminary, a convent, and an orphanage, making it a famous scenic area in the south of Shanghai. Deep in the greenery, the sound of church bells, hymns, and textbook recitations can be heard from time to time. The tranquility, peace, and solemnity form a strong contrast with the bustling Shanghai, turning it into a small paradise (to be continued).</p>
<p>Brief Commentary: Compulsory Labor Insurance</p>
<p>The Ministry of Social Welfare, in order to improve people's welfare and promote social policies, is implementing "social insurance" and "simplified insurance" as state-owned enterprises, and has specially established the Social Simplified Insurance Bureau to take charge of it.</p>
<p>According to a report on the 21st, the city will first implement compulsory labor insurance starting on the 22nd. According to the provisions of the promulgated interim outline, the objects of labor insurance are (1) factories subject to the Factory Law, (2) mines subject to the Mining Law, and (3) those engaged in dangerous or unhygienic work. All of these are insured under the compulsory labor insurance. The insurance premium is 5% of the insured person's monthly remuneration, but the insured person only needs to pay 1.5%, and the remaining 3.5% is paid by the employer (i.e., the capital side). After joining the insurance, insurance benefits can be enjoyed in case of death, injury, illness, or childbirth due to the performance of duties.</p>
<p>We believe that such social policies, which are entirely designed for the welfare of the people, are commendable in their intention. We hope that those in charge can implement them effectively in accordance with laws and regulations, which will surely gain social trust. However, this kind of undertaking is still a pioneering effort in our country, especially one with a "compulsory" nature. At the beginning of its implementation, people are prone to doubts because they do not fully understand it. Therefore, the competent authorities must explain it clearly in detail so that everyone understands.</p>
<p>As for the word "compulsory" in compulsory insurance, we have an analogy. It is the same as the current public health authorities' compulsory vaccination of citizens. The authorities spend a lot of money to vaccinate the public for the sake of the citizens' health. Therefore, this kind of "compulsion" is also out of good intentions. We hope that the labor community will first understand this point.</p>
<p>Commentary: Rectifying Politics</p>
<p>This column translated and published the "Current Urgent Tasks of the Joint Business Association" discussed in the Dalu Daily on July 20th on the previous two days. In addition to the seven important issues discussed, the conclusion believes that if China wants to achieve success in controlled economy, it must first establish a greater political power... Therefore, the focus of the new policy must be on rectifying politics. This sentence can be regarded as earnest and well-meaning!</p>
<p>Originally, politics is economics, and economics is politics; rectifying politics can rectify economics. However, judging from the general structure of China, how easy is it to rectify? The ingrained habits of the Chinese people are deeply rooted. The spirit of doing things centers on conservatism, ethics are based on prejudice, and the bad habit of pursuing personal gain at public expense seems unbreakable. Thinking of these dark aspects, it is not easy to see the light without a drastic change of direction.</p>
<p>Standing on the economic front, what we are looking forward to is the Shanghai economy after the recovery of the concessions. It can be improved due to the rectification of politics. Although we "must not have excessive expectations" for the national controlled economic institutions, we must not feel despair either, because if we do not despair, hope will not be cut off from us!</p>
<p>Estimated Wheat Procurement</p>
<p>According to the Wheat Flour Professional Committee, the estimated wheat procurement volume for this year is a maximum of 8 million bags and a minimum of 6.5 million bags.</p>
<p>The Materials Control Committee Strengthens Investigation Work</p>
<p>The Materials Investigation Committee held its second plenary committee meeting at 3 pm on the 23rd. More than ten Chinese and Japanese committee members attended, including Mayor Chen, Zhao Zunyue, Yuan Yuquan, Wang Zhigang, Advisor Okada, and Minister Tajiri. Chairman Chen Gongbo presided over the meeting. The most important cases passed included a proposal to strengthen the investigation team for public service needs to facilitate work, a proposal to strictly keep investigation materials and results confidential, a proposal to establish an investigation officer liaison meeting, and a method for rewarding whistleblowing and the seizure of illegal national important materials.</p>
<p>Business Summary</p>
<p>Gold and Silver: Gold jewelry in silver shops is still suspended for retail sales. Listed prices and handling fees remain the same. There is no market among peers, and few transactions outside the industry. In the early morning, the customs saw a gradual rise, rising several hundred by noon. The price of silver is the same as before.</p>
<p>Public Bonds: The market is slightly stronger, but it only strengthens slightly with the rise in stocks. Also, because the intermediate decline was very large, it then slightly rose.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: People's hearts are weak, and transactions are quiet. Market prices are falling. Longtou fine cloth fell again, and Sizijun fine wool fell slightly. Taohua women's cloth and White Cat floral cloth remained unchanged, and Sanyang fine wool also fell.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn: Because it was the weekend, there were usually fewer transactions. In addition, the authorities strictly investigated the hoarding of yarn and cloth. There was a market without transactions. Only 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix and 20-count Double Horse singles were opened. The former price was lowered, and the latter rose slightly.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Transactions are sluggish. Matches, soap, and candles are all at their peak. Cigarettes are becoming increasingly scarce, soaring upwards. Old British knives, Wuhua fairies, and others have all issued new prices. Qianmen customers are rarely interested. The market is still stable. Other domestic and Japanese cigarettes are flying high.</p>
<p>Grains: In the recent grain market, mung beans once broke through the customs due to strong sales, but now they have gradually declined and returned to the customs. Soybeans are still strong, and soybean cakes are fluctuating.</p>

<p>Disaster Reports from Various Parts of Shandong Province</p>
<p>Various parts of Shandong Province have suffered successive disasters of floods, droughts, insects, and hailstorms. Last year, many wheat fields in the disaster areas were not planted, and there is a serious shortage of food this spring, causing the disaster areas to expand to more than sixty counties and districts, with the number of disaster victims reaching more than one thousand million people. The situation is extremely serious. The investigation of the disaster situation in various regions is as follows:</p>
<p>Jinan City: Last autumn, it was tragically flooded, inundating properties worth millions of yuan. Tens of thousands of refugees were affected, and after entering winter, they slept in the open and begged, filling the streets and alleys. More disaster victims have flowed in from various places this spring. Although the government has set up shelters, it is now unable to provide relief.</p>
<p>Tangyi County, Guan County, Yecheng County, and Qiu County: The entire territory of each county was severely drought-stricken throughout the year last year, with poor harvests in all three seasons. Wheat was not sown, and after entering winter, the people's food supply was exhausted. Grass roots and tree bark were almost completely stripped and eaten. Refugees wandered and moved, resting in ditches. This spring, rainfall was again delayed, and the land was barren for miles. The disaster situation is severe. Although there was heavy rain in mid-May, the young and strong did not return from their wandering, and no one was planting. There is still a period of famine, and it is difficult to provide universal relief.</p>
<p>Linqing County: The disaster situation is widespread throughout the territory, but the situation in the third, sixth, and seventh districts is particularly serious.</p>
<p>Boping County, Heze County, Guantao County, Renping County, and Tai'an County: Each county suffered severe droughts last spring and summer, and autumn harvests were poor. Wheat was not sown, and not a drop of rain fell this spring. Tree bark, grass roots, and seeds were eaten completely. People died or fled, and the situation was tragic. The disaster has reached the entire territory.</p>
<p>Linqu County: Years of drought have plagued the people, and the situation is severe, making it difficult to provide universal relief.</p>
<p>Jiyu County: Last year's drought disaster reached the entire territory, especially the fourth district, where the disaster was particularly severe in thirteen townships.</p>
<p>Linzi County: The county is bordered by mountains in the south and sandy beaches in the north. The population is dense and the area is small. In years of good harvest, the food supply is still insufficient. Suffering from years of drought, the famine has reached its extreme. Although methods have been tried, it is difficult to provide universal relief.</p>
<p>Yi County: Years of poor harvests, last year's drought followed by flooding, followed by hailstorms, the situation is extremely severe. The seventh district, Hanzhuang Town, and other townships are particularly famine-stricken.</p>
<p>Sishui County: The flood in 1940 caused half of the villages in the entire territory to become swamps. The drought in 1941 meant no rain in spring and summer, no harvest of winter wheat, and withered autumn seedlings. The drought was particularly severe in 1942. There is still a period of famine. The disaster has reached the entire territory. Apart from the bandit areas, there are about 40,000 people displaced and waiting for food. The tragic situation is currently impossible to relieve.</p>
<p>Laiwu County: Famine is frequent, and wailing is everywhere. The number of disaster victims in the county has reached more than 20,000. There is now also a severe hailstorm, with 200 to 300 villages affected.</p>
<p>Ningyang County: Years of barren grass and barren land have plagued the people, and the distress has reached its extreme.</p>
<p>Yidu County: Years of drought and lack of food have left the people unable to eat their fill every day. People are starving and dying every day, with three to five deaths each time. The various tragic scenes are unbearable to hear and see.</p>
<p>Yucheng County: Last year's drought caused a reduction in the autumn harvest, especially in the five townships of Jincheng, Zhongren, Zhongzheng, Junming, and Taihe in the eastern part of the second district. All the food harvested before was used up last winter. To this day, the people have not only not planted spring crops, but also have difficulty maintaining their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Pu County: Years of drought have only yielded 20-30% of the autumn harvest. Disaster victims are everywhere, and the scene is too tragic to bear.</p>
<p>Guangrao County: Last year's disasters were particularly severe. The ears of the autumn harvest were not sticky, and since the beginning of spring, there has been no rain or snow. Winter wheat has not been sown, and hundreds of thousands of disaster victims have stripped and eaten grass roots, tree bark, miscellaneous grains, and chaff.</p>
<p>En County: Last year's promotion of cotton fields was frequent, and the people were extremely panicked.</p>
<p>Pingyuan County: The same as Guangrao County.</p>
<p>Huantai County: Last year's poor harvest and the narrow land and dense population have made it difficult for the people to obtain food since the beginning of spring.</p>
<p>Wenshang County: Last year's flood caused a poor harvest of winter wheat. Disaster victims were forced to make a living outside the customs, supporting the old and carrying the young. There were already more than 10,000. Those who had difficulty raising travel expenses were trapped in their hometowns and ate taro seedlings and dried vegetables. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Linyi County: The land is barren and the people are poor. The disaster is severe and they have not obtained food. There is great panic. It is now summer, and spring plowing has not yet been sown.</p>
<p>Xintai County: The drought disaster is extremely severe. Years of poor harvests have caused people to flee in all directions, accounting for half of the county's population. There has been another drought this spring, and the scene of starvation is too tragic to bear.</p>
<p>Lai County: Years of disasters have been frequent. Last year, there was no rain, and the autumn harvest withered. The people had nothing to eat. They mourned each other in the streets, and the tragic situation has reached its extreme.</p>
<p>Muping County: The city is remote, and the food supply is still insufficient. Last year's autumn harvest was not abundant. This spring, the people are starving, and the corpses of the dead are everywhere, making life unbearable.</p>
<p>Licheng County: Last autumn's flood inundated 2,200 rooms and 5,825 mu of land, affecting a total of 5,672 people.</p>
<p>Changshan County: Last year's flood inundated 808 houses, causing losses of about 150,000 yuan, affecting a total of 3,604 people. The vitality has not yet recovered.</p>
<p>Putai County: The disaster has reached the entire territory, with more than 60 villages inundated and more than 80,000 mu of land affected, affecting a total of 40,000 people.</p>
<p>Gaoyuan County: Last autumn's heavy flood inundated more than 30 villages, and there was also a severe locust plague.</p>
<p>Louxia County: Last autumn's heavy flood washed away all the highways and bridges, and many houses collapsed. (To be continued)</p>
