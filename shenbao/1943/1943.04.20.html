<h3 id="c1">澈查囤積外請求兩事 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>我們痛感邇來物人影同漲不巳，民生疾苦日深，同時，迭接各界讀者來函，申述不堪負荷生活重擔的困苦情形，以及報告投機囤積者的喪心病狂，盼望我們作正義呼聲表命令，澈査上海大規模投機囤積，我們滿懷欣慰感激之忱，實非言語所可形容。更就觀感所及，傳達人民公意，從各方面貢獻意見，無非擁護政府政令，緩和物價高漲的嚴重性，以取信於人民。但經過半月來的事實發展，我們始終認爲不能如此隨便了此一大公案。或許政府目前有何不得巳之窒礙，暫時沉靜，在政府未決定辦法以前，我們無所顧忌，無所隱諱，諍言直陳，以坦白求政府採納。這是我們的態度。所以這次投機囤積案的澈査，我們祇得靜候政府最後的斷然處理，昭示大衆。</p>
<p>我們尙有不能巳於言者，往者固將靜候解決辦法，但爲防患未然，產有迅速確定防止投機囤積辦法的必要，以爲亡羊補牢之計。如果因澈查囤積牽涉方面太多，未能斷然處理，則下舉兩事，不難立即執行：</p>
<p>（一）官商分野　簡單的說，做了官，即不准兼營商業；經營了商業，即不准兼做官。有人一方面什財部服務，一方面則直接簡接參加商業銀行。或者一方面在國家銀行供職，一方面則兼任商業銀行職務。即其一例。這種做了官，又營商者，縱不牽涉投機囤積的嫌疑，而與「公務員不准兼商」的政府法令，實相抵觸，巳無推諉解釋的餘地。所以，我們竭誠請求政府速下嚴厲命令，規定時期，限令公務人員各自檢點，自動的辭官或辭商，專幹一門，逾限不辭，一經査出，予以懲戒處分。</p>
<p>（二）國家銀行放款應有標準　按國家銀行經營業務範圍，在「中央儲備銀行法」中，已有滑晰規定，該法第二十六條爲業務上之限制，其第二款載：「對於私人或公司或其他私法人之放款，重貼現，或其他墊款，及收買其匯票支票，或其他票據，合計每戶不得超過五十萬元，……」又第七款載：「不得爲信用放款或透支。」又第八款載：「不得爲有投機性質之營業。」近年上海一地，新設小銀行頗多，傳聞因某種特殊關係，而與中央儲備銀行有信用放款及透支往來者，爲數不少，而其放款數額達數百萬或以上者。試問此種新設小銀行究竟根據何種標準，可以取得放款，取得放款以後，是吾扶植工商業，還是從事投機囤積。我們當然無從確悉中央儲備銀行的業務和賬務實况，不能斷定必有其事。諺云：「空穴來風，其來有自。」我們願借用公文上的習語：「有則改之，無則加勉。」盼望該行愼重放款。同時，更盼望政府主管當局，密切澈査該行放款業務，是否合法，並隨時督促，必須合法。</p>
<p>中央政府最高監察機關之監察院，依法有行使彈劾和審計之職權，監察委員，對於公務員有違法失職之行爲，得單獨提出彈劾。我們盼望監察院當局對於這次澈査囤積一案，加以注意，必要時根據政府賦予之特權，不怕事，不顧忌，偵査屬實後，提出彈劾，運用監察院的超然地位，以發揮監察權的効能，以克盡監察的責任。</p>
<p>我們始終堅決的認定：政府要强化政治地位，必先取得人民一致信仰；而取得人民信仰，非從改善民生入手不爲功；目前能解決物價問題，卽是改善民生最收實效的辦法；同時，取締投機囤積，尤爲爲解決物價問題最迫切易效的辦法。深信賢明的當局，早在洞察之中。我們今天値得重複申言的：一是靜候澈査囤積的結果，以昭信大衆。二是嚴密防止今後投機囤積的再發生，不致重苦大衆。</p>

<h3 id="c2">敵人戰術的絕望 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>要知道敵人的戰爭方法是怎樣的卑劣，是怎樣的兇惡，我們日本國民，原無須再拿外國的事例來作左證；然而現在敵人施於歐洲各國的轟炸，不僅表示出他們愈益暴露其兇惡性和劣等的國民性，更且表示出他們爲欲挽回敗勢於有利，不惜出以神人共誅的手段。他們對於德意，固不必說，對於法國，荷蘭，比利時，現在也實行着慘烈的言目轟炸。不，不，那不能只用盲目轟炸的一語來名之，簡直是對於非戰鬥的民衆之有計畫的轟炸。從現在他們實行於歐洲的轟炸目標來判斷，是如此的，從去年這時向日本襲來的美機行爲——例如明知是小學校而濫施轟炸——來判斷，也是如此的。</p>
<p>據最近電報，英國空軍大臣　克萊，最沂大放其厥詞說：「英國空軍的戰果，由破壞住宅區的多少來決定。」一般人常漢然以爲：英國人的殘虐性，固然是天下的常識，可是其縱如何殘虐，較之美國人，則尙差一籌，然而聽了辛克萊的厥詞，必可發現美國人和英國人之間，完全沒有什麽差異，當無疑問餘地吧。日德意是他們的敵國，如果他們濫用其卑劣到極點的攻擊方法時，日德意若欲用同一的方法還擊，是沒有不可之理的；然而英美對於像法蘭西人那樣守着中立的民衆，竟加以有計畫的轟炸，則其作爲，可以用怎樣的名義來使之正當化呢？例如巴黎市，當法軍當局宣布其爲非設防之都市後，雖在交戰中的德軍，曾亦加以尊重，但是英國空軍，則竟在法國回復到中立立塲之後，而開始轟炸巴黎了。並且作爲其轟炸目標的都市，數目與日俱增。盧昂以下的西部及西北部諸都市，所受損害，實屬慘痛之極。而且這個傾向，到了最近，愈益加甚，消息傳來，他們對於巴黎住宅區，又在濫施其慘炸了。法國人民對此而表痛恨憤怒，理屬當然，已以國民名義，向國際紅十字會提出訴狀，質問英美對付法國的意圖如何了。更就其施於比利時，荷蘭等小國無辜民衆的轟炸行爲來看，稱爲大國雄邦者，共所行的戰爭道德，難道便是如此的嗎！</p>
<p>英美現在是小顧戰爭道德的了，在前决大戰中，美軍完全不知戰爭道德，這意見，無論是敵是友，莫不一致。但在今日，英軍也竟和美軍一樣，無所選擇，已不顧戰爭道德了。他們對於法、荷、比各國的施行轟炸，雖出於其殘虐性，然而同時也是其有着一定目的之手段。其目的或者是要驅使此等國民於暴動，至少是一種要激起大混亂之愚笨的計畫，或者楚妄想如此做夾可以在某種意味上有利於其向歐洲大陸的登陸作戰。總之，無疑是出於某種目的的。</p>
<p>速謀打開目前戰局是英美的燃眉之急。德蘇戰綫，將繼續着現在的狀態而轉入夏季戰陣；北　戰綫，不久即要進入不能戰鬥之酷熱季候，面臨着暗澹的前途。所以他們的焦躁，是明白可睹的。然而隨着焦躁程度的增高，他們便愈益逞其絕望的在暴，也是可以預料的。敵人所企圖侵犯日本神聖之地的計畫，我們也可以依着上述標準去推想。所以我們應該有深刻的覺悟以謀對付，應該牢記着敵人是不理會戰爭道德的，他們縱出如何作爲，斷不能把它視爲意外的。（丁：譯自四月八日每日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c3">日機活躍太平洋　瓜達坎納爾島被炸　澳相寇丁向美發出呼籲　現有空軍力不足供防守 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據華盛頓消息：美海軍部昨日宣稱，星期五晚日機曾襲所羅門羣島之瓜達坎納爾島之美軍陣地，財產損害與人民傷亡甚巨。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十九日中央社電　據此間所接消息稱，澳洲政府近曾與反軸心軍總司令麥克沃塞相呼應，要求華盛頓聯合司令部派遣空軍部隊增援澳洲。但美政府一再固執加港會談所商之辦法，未依所請，因此美海長諾克斯與麥克沃塞意見對之愈形深刻。澳洲首相寇丁於十八日晚對國內發表廣播演說時，曾指出日軍之威脅，謂羅斯福與邱吉爾巳在加港會談中決定世界戰略，澳洲當即根據此種決定，結果澳洲在資源與戰力各方面消耗頗多，並在其他部門儘量動員，故國人應知今後之困難定必增多，允應加倍努力。余於此願向盟邦諸國重申前言，澳洲政府對加港會談所決定之世界戰略極表贊同，即吾人同意於打倒德軍後，將澳洲作爲發動攻勢之基礎。但此並非謂運來澳洲軍資材尤其軍用飛機目下數量雖微，於西南太平洋持久戰所需數量亦佳之意。例如日機於上週轟炸米倫灣時，反軸心空軍雖曾起飛反擊，但日機多架不顧反軸心機之邀擊，終於飛至目標之上空完成任務。所謂任務者乃炸沉吾人貴重之船舶也。反軸心軍雖欲向日軍實行反攻，但迄無實行之機會。且日機每次來襲，均使澳洲深感威脅，增大空軍勢力亦隨之消耗，故澳洲逢莫大危機，是以國人不應漠視云。</p>

<p>阿根廷京城十八日電　日軍航本部隊連日猛烈轟炸西南太平洋反軸心基地，使反軸心軍對此異常恐慌。最近盛傳反軸心軍轟炸名手馬開拉少將，在于加魯島因飛機互撞而死。關於是項消　，澳洲反軸心軍司令部頃發表如下：西南太平洋之轟炸大王馬開拉少校，最近無故戰死，蓋馬開拉於上星期出發轟炸之際，適於于加魯飛機一隊自滑翔路飛來撞及該機，致該機立即傾覆，所搭載之昨彈全行爆炸，故馬開拉少校典同乘之飛行員全部被炸。</p>

<p>離滿前聲明</p>
<p>大連十九日中央社電　我國訪滿特派大使周佛海氏於離滿返國之際，特發表聲明，闡明中日滿三國協力完遂戰爭之決意，大意謂：「余此次訪問滿洲國，備受滿洲國朝野及關東軍之熱誠歡迎，並立即予以考察上之種種便利，乃得完成任務，實使余銘感難忘。余前曾於抵達貴國時發表聲明，說明余訪問貴國之任務有二：（一）爲促進中滿兩國之團結，以資協力盟邦日本完遂大東亞戰爭，（二）爲考察貴國十年來之經濟建設狀况，余自九日抵達新京，至十六日來大連止，爲時雖僅八日，但收獲甚多，實出意外。余於此特對滿洲國朝野，及關東軍深致謝忱。夫大東亞戰爭之完成，必須具備精神與物質兩方面之力量。今知滿洲國與中日兩國同樣具有與軸心國一心一德，團結一致爭取勝利之決心及信念，此爲滿洲國巳具備精神力量之證明。余此次曾經吉林，哈爾濱，奉天，旅順，鞍山，各地參觀，目覩各該地軍需工業設備，其規模之大，進步之述，此爲滿洲國已具備物質力量之證明。東亞軸心旣擁有如此偉大雄渾之精神與物質力量，確信最後勝利，必屬告人。余於此次訪問之　，相信吾人前途希望無限，未來之光明，必可獲得，故今後吾入尙須加倍努力，以期早日獲得最後勝利。</p>
<p>對記者談話</p>

<p>（問）如何振興實業，以適應戰時體制。（答）振興實業，首須有合理的統制辦法，當前之計，政府首要調　過去統制方法，使統制合理化，同時强化工商業機構，類如同業公會，最近產生之全國商業統制總會，係屬於調整工作之列。實業方面最主要者，在人民衣食問題之解決，今後本部所主要者爲增加棉麻毛及其他織維等製布品，以解決人民衣食的需要。</p>
<p>（問）友邦交還之軍管理工廠，吾國如何加以振興，從　生產。（答）關於工廠問題，當局現止作通盤計劃，以復興上海無錫各地之工廠爲第一步，不過工業方面原料燃料兩大問題，須先解決，故政府正謀積極增產辦法，以謀解決燃料之困難。至於各種紙業原料目前固屬困難，然吾人亦須積　謀生產增加，不過目前惟有努　求工業原料的供給自足。</p>
<p>（問）如何抑平物價，杜絕投機囤積等不正當營業。（答）現當局正講求商業機構之調整，同時誘導市塲遊資，從　生產事業，而當務之急，須使巾塲資金之活動，納入正軌，則投機風氣，自可逐漸消除。</p>
<p>（問）消費合作社事業，目前似感不足，當局有何對策調整。（答）現在一般物價太高，一般人民購買力低弱，治標辦法，　有　力節的消費，至於治本，當然須從速充實農村金融增加生產，則生活物資供需，方能得其平衡，物價始能安定。</p>

<p>— 憲章</p>
<p>河南古稱中州，爲四戰地，而沿平漢綫之豫中三軍鎭——鄭州，許昌，漯河，當東西南北交通之要衝，歷代兵爭之時，尤往往以此數地之安危得失，卜大局之前途。</p>
<p>鄭州在戰前，本爲河南最大商埠。戰爭爆發後，雖因黃河决口，鐵路拆除，受了相當影響，但當去年春每日由黃河東岸輸入的商品，平均總在一千萬元以上。</p>
<p>許昌在戰前，爲許·襄·郟·舞·葉·一帶的菸草輸出地，戰後雖因鐵路拆卸，而另一方面，襄城因爲南濱汝河，舟楫可直達蚌埠，奪了許昌戰前的地位。但許昌的機器捲烟廠，多達數十家，在豫中各縣，仍首屈一指。以製令箭牌紙烟著名的豫成烟廠，戰初資本不過兩千元，現已積累至兩千萬元，每月繳稅多達數十萬元，眞是一本萬利。</p>
<p>漯河與郾城（古召陵）隔沙河遙望，因與駐馬店同爲豫中各縣黃豆芝蔴之集散地，故自平漢通車以後，在短短三四十年間，與站南的匯源寨，合爲一體，發達成了一個長達五里的都市，因濱臨沙河，舟楫可直達界首蚌埠，乘汽車又可東至界首阜陽，歸，毫，西北至洛陽，西安，西南通甫陽，老河口，故於戰後竟取鄭州地位而代之，當二十九年時，每日交易平均已達五百萬元左右。舊日的火車站台，全都成了繁華的商塲。</p>
<p>自去秋鄭州一度失守，物資加緊封鎖以後，三鎭對後方輸血管的功用，漸漸失去。鄭州因雙方嚴密封河，已成死市，許昌商店，關　亦多，漯河亦與界首，同其命運。加以河南今歲兩季荒歉，豫中特甚，當地貿易，亦形銳减，回首三鎭一兩年前的繁榮，眞有隔世之感。</p>
<p>在豫中一帶旅行，更處處引起人懷古之感，鄭州新鄭，爲古鄭國地，晋楚爭霸之焦點，小國介居兩大之間，處境煞是可憐。許昌實曹操挾漢獻帝遷都之處，迄今受禪台，受禪牌（最近土人因官吏責令榻摹之無饜，已將碑下面五分之四用火焚壤）。猶在，而曹氏父子，骨且已朽。由許昌西行，往襄葉，有關公挑錦袍處，　谷舊地，頴考叔墓，李膺墓，長沮桀溺偶耕，子路問津處，南有頴川故郡，北有漢荀氏八龍墓，古趣盎然，如人史境，較之旅行南方，就經濟觀點言，雖較富裕，但就考古言，宛如橫波沙漢時之興味索然。（三十二年三月十日轉寄）</p>

<p>柏林十九日中央社電　據海通訊：此次　匈二國元首舉行會談，證實二國間傳統上之友善及其同作戰之精神。兩國茲巳決定作戰直至勝利獲得而後已，而敵國一般對匈牙利態度表示懷疑者亦可釋懷矣。緣過去英國路透社屢次散播謠言謂，一旦英美侵略東南歐時，匈牙利軍隊　不與英美軍隊作戰：或英美軍隊於東南歐登陸後，匈牙利即將東綫上作戰之匈軍撤回。英方並作空言，成立巴爾幹協約，此項協約並包括獨立之匈牙利在內，此種挑撥離間手腕，亦如對付南斯拉夫者然，以米漢羅維樞叛軍爲反軸心侵略軍之先鋒。然自該項叛軍完全失敗後，敵人期冀匈牙利單獨和平之妄想乃吿破滅。嗣英美又作其他企圖，謂匈牙利雖願抵抗布爾雪維克主義，但並無抵抗英美軍隊之意。此次希特勒與匈攝政會談後，敵人之種種計劃乃吿完全失敗。敵人政治陰謀決不能分烈軸心國在東南歐之堅强陣綫。匈牙利義大利曁羅馬尼亞現已作明確表示，若非勝利獲得，決不停止戰爭。且英美異蘇聯均係同樣敵人，因二者目標均在毀滅歐洲也。</p>

<p>敵人英美的宣傳謀略，經過了　　戰爭五年，大東亞戰　一年有餘，現已成爲所謂政治攻勢的一翼，越發銳露其鋒鋩，從本年初以來，撒播於全世界的所謂戰後的國境問題，經濟，貨幣，糧食問題，民族問題等等，無止幾十百項的「戰後計畫」，不消說是英美派的很大規模的謀略。他們在第一次大戰時，　橫驅使其所謂「第四軍」的宣傳謀略，不管陸海空三軍繼續地敗北，終於藉着這第四軍的威力，把德意志第二帝國打倒，因着這個經騐，所以他們現在還是希冀着運用這第四軍以獲得「最後勝利」。現在他們的第四軍是怎樣地僞裝，怎樣地用着譎計狡術以操縱世界的呢？下面就把他們第四軍的陣容和戰術，燃犀燭照地表曝出來，以作我們思想戰陣和防諜戰陣日强化之資。</p>
<h3 id="c40">英國的宣傳謀略　利用電波和傳單的新戰術 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>（瑞典京城嬉野特派員九日發）自第一次大戰時的北巖爵士（Northeliffe）以來，成爲所謂官傳謀略的大本營之英國謀略本部，現在設置於情報部內，由新聞社老前輩布楞同。布拉肯掌其全權。這情報部，在去年曾宣傳着北非的速戰速決，可是因着羅美爾軍的先發制人，搶着反軸心軍的機先，佔領了要衝挨爾阿拉美因，弄得大糟其糕，引起了首腦部的大調動。現在於布拉肯的統率之下，布置着密不漏水的陣勢。情報部的主要工作爲從事無綫電播音，統轄新聞和對於軸心國佔領地域及中立諸國等之謀略宣傳。</p>
<p>第四軍的唯一武器—無綫電播音</p>
<p>現在英國以無綫電播音爲武器，對於西亞，東亞，中南美，北美，非洲等，亂放其謀略的電波BBC播音臺（倫敦）的對歐播音，應用着約二十國的國語，從早到夜，瘏口曉音地宣說着。英國的對歐播音中，最爲巧妙惡辣的方策，有如下述三種。</p>
<p>第一，是所謂「格斯塔夫。奇克夫利德」播音局。實際上那就是倫敦的BBC播音台所播送的。總之，所稱爲「在德國國內或在其佔領地的某處，安置着秘密發信設備的，」其實就是用着德國國內無綫電同一波長，大散謠言，以圖德國後力的攪亂，動搖。當然，德國國民是不會上他們的當的。可是，他們的强聒不舍的精神，的確是很可怕的。</p>
<p>第二，是天主敎布音的惡計。試舉一例：最近以德國國內天主敎播音的聽者爲對手，突然冒充了梵諦岡（羅馬敎皇廳）播音，肆其誹謗德國首領們的大演說，而且還插進了古典音樂的點綴。這種搗鬼，與其說會使敬虔的信者憤慨，母寗使他們啞然失笑。他們這種惡辣的冒充矯作，使梵諦岡對之，極端地深惡痛絕。</p>
<p>第三，是BBC用着法語，挪威語，弗蘭德爾語等一批德國佔領地域的國話來播音。在這種播音的中間，常突然宜稱有重要消息，或是說被佔領國的亡命皇帝「明天早上回國」，或是說「英美軍於某月某日，在德佔領地的某處登陸」，此等瞎三話四的播音，有點像秘密通信一樣，冀圖淆亂佔領地的民心。</p>
<p>空中散下偽造的購肉憑證</p>
<p>英國各報，受着當局的指使，常以鼓煽民衆抗戰意識的文字，來大書特寫，可是從來爲了要誹謗德國的緣故，濫說其德國空軍本格的空襲英本土等的夢話，却使國民的抗戰意識反而弛綏。現在也覺得那樣的辦法不對，於是便展開了煽動民衆的運動，最近又提出了「長期戰」的口號，說「我們的前途越發多事多端」，而變更其編輯指導的態度。</p>
<p>用飛機從被佔領地域上空散放傳單的舊式方法，他們已經知道沒有多大效果，所以最近已開始改用包　　　的傳單來散擲。這傳單上寫着：「德國潛艇的威脅最近頓爲减少，因之對於英國本土的糧食運輸，極爲順途，這乳膏就是分給你們的」等話。又從空中更散下僞造配給肉的憑證，以圖攪亂配給戰綫。</p>
<p>在中立國的英美公使館，都發行着日刋的宣傳公報及其他小冊子之類，揭載着於反軸心國有利的情報，而且英國方面還設置着特殊機關，以作文化宣傳，尤其是輸入圖書，舉行著名音樂家，科學家，著作家們的集會等，作爲懷柔的新手段。又英美攝製的影片，其宣傳力量也不容忽視。</p>
<p>有一個曾出席凡爾賽會議的英國著名外交官，嘗慨嘆着說：</p>
<p>「宣傳雖然是勝利上有力而不容或缺的武器。在第一次大戰時，宣傳誠然有着很大的助力，但另一方面却大爲戰後和平之害，這一點是不能輕易看過的。那就是因着宣傳的過事誇張，使各國民相互間的敵愾心根深蒂固地牢植着，而永久泯滅不掉。」這是他指摘在上屆大戰時，，英國的宣傳陣營裏，製造出「德國人因爲糧食不足，甚至連死屍的肉也吃起來」的荒唐謠言，以致種下了戰後禍根的感慨之言。現在英國（美國當然也不能例外）的宣傳陣營，不管有着這樣的敎訓，其惡辣之度，依然不能以言話形容；他們爲了要獲勝之故，無論什麽極惡不肖的話都說得出來，把盎格魯撒克遜鬼畜般的本性，盡情無遺蘊地暴露出來。</p>
<p>策動陰謀和暗殺的參謀本部</p>
<p>英國於上述情報部以外，還有稱爲情報局的特殊機關。這情報局竟可目爲英國對敵謀略中樞中的中樞，不晨於情報部，而在外交，海陸空各部共轄之下；其機構除了局長凡西塔特之外，恐怕沒有一個人會得明了吧。在這回大戰爆發的前夜，英國外交部對於德蘇不侵犯條約，南斯拉夫的參加三國同盟等重大事件，直到當事國發表出來，始終蒙在鼓裏，未能先事偵悉，大受議會的攻擊。因此，英國嗣後對於情報局的强化，傾注着異常的努力，到現在竟可誇稱爲「歐洲第一。」它的面貌，由着下舉的幾椿事件，不難想像而知。</p>
<p>一九三九年十一月，在墓尼黑的「俾猶爾加·布勞伊·開拉」，暗殺希特勒元首未遂的事件。一九四〇年，英國商人立克曼和廣吿業者俾克斯，陰謀炸毀瑞典的製鐵工廠和港灣設施，以圖阻害瑞典鋼鐵的運往德國而被發覺下獄的事件。又一九四一年，南斯拉夫駐英公使館的行李在伊斯坦堡的旅館中突然爆炸的事件。凡此等等，沒有不是英國的電報局使着手脚的間諜行爲。據瑞典報福爾開塔格勃蘭德去年秋間的報道，倫教情報局本部，是依着政治區分爲外國，殖民地，國內三部門，又依着職能區分爲陸軍關係（窩爾德格羅挨。開爾上校掌管），海軍關係（各得夫利提督掌管），空軍關係（巴翁華爾少校掌管），新聞關係（科開利爾爵士掌管），繪畫攝影關係（羅孫布拉姆掌管），暗號關係（阿文爵士掌管）等諸部門，此外更有領事部，攻勢部等。攻勢部甚至如法律或金融專門家，也羅致爲幹部，以從事國際的積極的間諜行爲。如暗殺，煽動，怠工等，都是奉着這部門的秘密命令而從事的。在本部裏面，又有有力的像參謀本部那樣的掌設機關。此外還有三個特設隊，直屬於首相官邸，爲情報局的當地活動機關。</p>
<p>第一，爲關於戰略及外交的，職司政治，經濟情報的蒐集，暴動，煽動，怠工等。第二，關於戰術的，那就是陸海軍的外國駐在館所屬武官。第三，即所謂間諜的。有着這樣龐大組織的情報局，其資金當然是非常浩大的。在一九三九年，情報局本部的費用，只是用在陸海軍情報關係方面的，巳達二千三百尤鎊之巨。此後的費用，自然還要不絕地增加的。</p>
<p>不擇手段的間謀</p>
<p>前次大戰之中和大戰之後，英格蘭銀行總裁蒙塔求諾曼，和美國大財閥摩根，共同收買報紙，雜誌和其他各種定期刊物的記者，以及中立國的政治家等，以蒐集秘密情報而揮霍了莫大的鉅金。一九一四年愛爾蘭著名的自由黨鬥十羅傑亞開伊斯門茲爵士，從美國赴德國的路上，在挪威被英國間諜暗殺。前次大戰中，羅馬尼亞國王却爾斯，爲了堅持中立之故而被暗殺，結果使羅馬尼亞加入協約軍方面。這些都是大張曉諭的事實。莫赫美得·哈求特拉契做着英國的間諜，也是有名的事實。</p>
<p>前大戰時英國間諜活動的事實，不勝枚舉：依此爲率，那末這次大戰中在英國情報局這般巧妙惡辣的間諜行爲之裏，其所舉成果是怎樣地又多又大，當不難想像得到的。英國間諜的標語，是「世界爲敵」，而且在世界的政治，經濟，社會或戰爭方法的本身，日益複雜化的現在，間諜的活動，也日益複雜，微妙，目困難而重大。在佔領地域的陰謀，反軸心煽動敎唆，暗殺，由着裝人屋頂和間囱內的點滅燈而播送摩爾斯（Morse）電報信號，以誘導夜閒飛機的飛行；由着秘密短波送波機以從事險惡之極的反軸心宣傳等等，英國間諜的活動，局勢越是不利，活動的方式越是深刻。並且，英國情報局這樣的魔手，也決不是以歐洲爲限，這又是　加以省識的。（丁：譯自四月十二日讀賣報知）</p>

<p>本月九日，貴州路一百廿四號陳泰昌包車行，大火焚斃多人案。老閘警察署對於此案，極爲重視。初疑該包車口主陳海元或有縱火嫌疑，但經調査陳所囤儲之貨物，其價　在國幣五十萬元以上，而所保火險　先施，華安，寧紹三公司保額總共爲老法幣二萬元，似此情形，可決其並無縱火圖賠事實。旋據該車行夥友姚銀泉稱，在起火時，彼適起床小便，見店主之侄陳金山，將舖蓋擔起，開鬥而出，其時樓梯下即起火焚燒，火勢極盛，立將扶梯燒斷。探等以陳金山嫌疑重大，遂將陳金山拘獲，提向捕房嚴詰。據陳金山供稱：年三十七歲，爲陳海元之侄，在陳泰昌內充當漆匠，本年一月間，因竊叔解交工部局二厘捐一百元，曾遭嚴責，乃四月六日店內又失竊松節油（即松香水）一介侖，又指我所竊，欲報捕究辦，我以叔如此無情，故懷恨於心，及至八日夜十時睡覺後，突思有以報復，乃於深夜近一時，即起未以松節油半介侖灌澆於樓梯下之竹絲上，乃點火燃燒，我則乘隙逃出，先至唐家弄新大肉莊阿姨處過宿一宵，翌晨至浦東東　路鼎泰麵店胞兄處，然後回家即遭拘捕，昨晨此案由特一法院提訊，捕房依縱火及殺人罪起訴，請求依法嚴予懲處，詰之陳金山，對於事實與捕房所供相同。庭上以尙須調閱騐尸筆錄，乃諭陳金山還押，改期再訊。</p>

<h3 id="c54">讀者論壇　增加警察俸給的必要 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭一鳴</p>
<p>凡做市民的人，都希望地方安寗，俾能安居樂業。上海爲通商大埠，中外雜居，自從大東亞戰爭發生後，警政改善，盜竊案件，大見减少，這是我們馨香祝禱的。</p>
<p>保衛疆士，需要軍隊；維持地方，則賴警察，警察實爲我們市民一日不可少的保護人，所以我們應當給予警察足够維持生活的俸給，以安其心，鼓勵其服務精神。</p>
<p>但據筆者最近調査所得，租界巡捕的每月俸給是二百八十五元，滬西和市區的警察，每月還不到一百元。這些俸給，要在目下的上海過生活，實在很難的。若然拿生活指數來計算，這些菲薄俸給，祇能一個人過十日的生活吧！大家知道警察責任重大，那末我們必定要使他個人能維持生活外，還要能供養其妻子三人。現在社會但知警察有利用職務便利，行爲不自檢點，而不知其俸給的確菲薄。筆者說這句話，絕不爲一般不能廉潔自好的警察袒護，實爲剷除其不廉潔行爲的澈底辦法，也爲我們市民應注意的事情。</p>
<p>筆者在極司非　路開一工廠，廠旁小屋內，住着一個有初中程度的警察，爲人很忠誠，上月他來廠請求筆者收留其子做一學徒，他說他的每月警察俸給，祗有九十三元，膳食自理。家有父母及其妻子二人，每月開銷至少五百餘元，幸其妻販賣蔬菜，能賺四百餘元，藉以貼補。現在物價高漲，不能希望其子小學畢業，急欲入廠工作，但求有膳食，不論津貼。</p>
<p>筆者聽到這一番話，方知道警察俸給是這樣微薄，料想不到每日做我們市民的保護人，還不及我們廠內學徒的待遇。因爲學徒的膳食，由廠方供給，每月有五六十元津貼及年終分紅。</p>
<p>寫到此地，筆者敢大膽的公開向政府當局及社會市民呼籲。對於警察俸給，實有大大增加的必要。我們要安定警察生活，則就爲社會洽安着想，希望大家注意這件事。</p>

<p>很奇怪的，日本的戰時經濟體制剛剛與中國的戰時經濟體制成了一個反比。</p>
<p>就拿銀行之合併與添設來說吧！</p>
<p>日本的普通商業銀行家數自戰事爆發以來，巳由昭和十二年之三七六家，合併减少至十七年之一四九家，儲蓄銀行亦自昭和十二之七二家，合併减少至十七年之六九家，而今年一月間又有二大銀行（三井與第一）之合併爲帝國銀行。這是日本銀行界爲適應戰時經濟體制而合併的輪廓。</p>
<p>中國的銀行界怎樣呢？近年來不特不能如東隣之合併减少，而且反如雨後春笋似的紛紛添設，而管理金融機關的當局似亦抱多多益善的態度　其自由添設。即以上海一埠而論，近年巳核准註册之新設銀行，信託公司，錢莊及其他共計九十一家，而在核辦中者尙有七十四家之多，致滬埠金融機關多如過江之鯽，謔者謂爲「銀行擺攤」。</p>
<p>銀行擺攤而不妨礙民生，倒也罷了！然聞新設的小銀行錢莊等，其主要營業即在投機囤積，以博暴利，置老百姓的生計於不顧，其與戰時經濟體制的距離，眞恐不知有幾千萬里！</p>

<p>肥皂</p>
<p>肥皂部門的籌備主任三田一夫氏，是三菱洋行雜貨部肥皂部分的負責者，在滿洲和上海與肥皂發生關係，已有十年左右的歷史，是肥皂業的權威者。他所發表的見解如次：</p>
<p>肥皂是日用品之一種。就其價格·種類·時間等而言，到今日似已成爲一個嚴重的問題。這首先是因爲原料的不足而感不安。總會下部組織的機構雖加改變，但原料若不同時加以統制，則不能順利進行。華中肥皂的消費約〇〇〇〇箱，生產能力日方佔八成，華方佔二成，可謂頗爲充分。最大的問題是原料，戰前，從澳洲輸入牛油，從南洋輪入椰干油及椰子核，自輸入斷絕之後，現在原料當然相當缺乏。華中雖然也有牛油和柏油等，但牛油增產的企圖，因爲牛的增產不是咄嗟所可立辦的事，而且牛油並也用作食料油，故大量充爲肥皂原料，似不可能，是以在戰時經濟政策上並不視爲切要。他如冒檢從南洋輸入椰子核和椰子油，亦以同樣理由，不加考慮。至於拍油，取自拍樹的種子，這因爲不能充作食糧，故很可以用爲肥皂原料。拍樹的種子是從山上野生的柏樹上採取的，完全不用人工裁培，所以增產亦屬無望。原在華中生產的原料，僅足供必要量的一半，故肥皂的生產量，亦祇半額，不能希望有再多的生產，祇有從消費節的方面設法。從現地所能採辦的原料來製造肥皂，是否能配給各地，成爲問題。於此，我想特別提醒大家；肥皂原料的油脂，是食料油，假使消費了很多的肥皂，就等於消費大量的食科油，可是上海的日本人所消費的肥皂，的爲本國三倍至五倍，這大概多由於環境造成　。至於囤積的問題，租界內現存的肥皂，的可供一年之用，大多數被中國人囤積起來。肥皂因爲在半年一年的期內不致腐壞，且所佔的地位也不大，便於囤積，因而成爲投機的對象。目前的肥皂對策，有原料津貼，排除囤積，節的消費三種方法，親制原料的收買機關，集中收買，與製造機關，消費機關，保持密切聯絡，再節約消費，配給圓滑，使各地方都能均霑。至於樓構方面，我以爲由中日組成一體的組合最好，但中國方面又反對的空氣，因爲恐怕由日本方面獨佔的緣故，尙須加以解釋，始能明瞭。（四月十七日大陸新報）</p>

<p>— 文中</p>
<p>見人有患難，不論他是親戚朋友，甚而至於素不相識的四海之內某一位「兄弟」，我總盡我的力量用金錢或勞力去幫他的「忙」，小至用幾句「忠言」去勉勵一位朋友，促進他的前進與成功，亦屬「幫忙」之例。本來互助是人類應盡的義務；求人幫忙當然是一種正大光明的權利！</p>
<p>事實上好多人都誤會「幫忙」的眞義，譬如說一位學生考試時要求同座者幫一下忙，同座者爲了「面情」關係，也就任他抄襲，又一位行人被警察査出了違禁品，或許會低聲說：「大家都是自家人，有話好商量……請行個方便幫幫忙……」暗中塞了鈔票了事，諸如此類的例子，舉不勝舉，總之雙方都誤解了「幫幫忙」。</p>
<p>社會上多數腐敗黑暗的事，皆由不正當的幫忙而起。某種人物之所以投機欺詐而仍可逍遙法外，又何嘗不是幕後有人「幫忙」的緣故？</p>
<p>切記着我們「幫忙」與「被幫忙」都應該是光明正大而具有正義感的！</p>
<h3 id="c68">「事實」與「想像」 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 潔輝</p>
<p>「事實」即是現在活生生的眞實的事物。如目今的「米珠薪桂」以及「計口授糧」「計口授糖」等都是。「想像」即是依據過去的記憶與經騐構成一種特殊的虛假的意識表象。此種表象不必與「事實」相符。如吃慣了苦東西的人想有一點糖吃吃是，叫化子「挖空心思」想做官，坐汽車，討小老婆也是一種「想像」。</p>
<p>有些因爲「事實」太苦，太窮，沒飯吃，一天到晚愁眉苦臉地大嚷其活不成，想翻身，想活得好些，「想像」着肚皮裝個飽，走路不致跌跌衝衝，「想像」着衣服別老是鶉衣百結，免叫人家翻着白眼看不起，但「事實」還是「事實」，現在依舊是飢餓，寒冷，遭白眼「想像」必須待之「將來」實現，所慮者到了那時，現在的「想像」仍舊是那時的「想像」。</p>
<p>「想像」是每個人必須有的，不得不有的東西，它即是「欲望」的表現。「想像」得最美麗最不合乎現實基礎的空中樓閣，易成爲「空想」「幻想」，其結果必與現實「背道而馳」，致成最苦痛最不堪設想的「事實」。</p>
<p>有錢的善「想像」，想更多的鈔票，女人。沒錢人更善「想像」，往「想像」中找尋快樂與甜密，「立地成佛」式的去「减少」和「消滅」事實的痛苦。正如有部小說中所設：「…他，士倫卡時常夢見着麵包的。有一次，他夢見無數麵包堆積在他的茅屋中，整個天井都蓋滿了糕餅。……他通夜大吃其美味的糕餅。到了早晨，他的女人粗聲說他們此後再沒有吃裸麥餅了。哦，還是完全不要醒過來好，還是睡覺好，睡覺好，他想」。這異曲同工於某則故事：「有個人，辛苦了整個白大，還是得不到好處，他說，沒關係，我每夜夢裏都做着皇帝」。</p>
<p>一個鄕下女人，向方丈瀝訴困苦的半生，請他救助，方丈聽畢答道：「忍着吧，天老爺使你生前受苦，死後定當賜福的」。不實際的「想像」唯有像死後再「賜福」於你一樣——「想像」的化成「事實」在墳墓裏。叫化子的非分妄想做官，坐汽車，討小老婆不就是這樣嗎？</p>
<p>不過，脚踏實地，具有現實基礎的「想像」，只要加之以堅强的毅力，不屈不撓的精神是不難成爲「事實」的，因爲他的「想像」中也含有「事實」的因素。</p>
<p>所以，浮虛的「想像」它會騙你跑進歧途，絕路。看淸，把握客觀「事實」的「想像」，加以主觀的努力，即能創造嶄新的生命！</p>

<p>— 劉寒若</p>
<p>白蕉及其門弟子書畫展，十九日揭幕於大新畫廳，爲時將歷一週。開幕日之晨，筆者抽暇往觀，先至者已甚擠，足見傾慕雲間藝術者，大有人在。</p>
<p>此次展覽品，綜計約三百餘件，畫的佔三分之一，書件爲主要展品。白蕉於書法素有硏摩，關於書學著述，已爲吾人數見不鮮。陳列品中，以楹聯爲多，屛條立軸較少，舊作多於新作，但均屬雋品，諸葛武侯戒娃書之立軸，寓意用筆，兩併佳妙。楹聯多集句，大都箴世與陶情怡性之作。</p>
<p>畫件中寫蘭，竹，石居多，墨蘭數幀，佈局超逸，灑脫出世，想爲作者於萬籟俱寂之際所寫，洵屬絕品。與唐大郞合作之蘭，如意，亦爲不可多觀之佳作。門弟子金學儀之紅梅，花，枝，梗皆見新筆，秀麗樸茂，淸新可喜。</p>
<p>扇面陳列者僅十數頁，精品甚多，歸去來兮辭之頁，尤爲可愛，冊頁之佳作亦夥。</p>
<p>作品標値，尙非高昂，墨蘭竹石，及楷書冊頁，合裱成一立軸，籤値僅二百元，想係舊作，否則以現時之高貴裱工計之，其所費當在百元以上，墨潤所餘無幾矣。</p>
<h3 id="c70">美的人格 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 惠人</p>
<p>崇高的地位，溥厚的財富，決不是靑年們最値得爭取的對象，美的人格才是最足以尊貴的。</p>
<p>把功利看得太重的人，往往假藉事業的大　，來粉飾他的詭計，欺騙，宣稱詭計是幹事業必需的手段，欺騙是幹事業應有的從權，毫不吝惜地在毀棄他潔白的人格。却不想想，不施詭計，也可幹了事業，不用欺騙，也可得到事業的成功。</p>
<p>而且，一定要施詭計，用欺騙，才能獵取專業的目標，邀得尊貴的名譽，那末，寗願放棄了牠們，來保全自身的人格，因爲以詭計，欺騙作基礎是很不穩固的，正像雲霞間的海市蜃樓，不久會倒毀，消失了的，這人格的汚損，豈不是徒然，枉曲！</p>
<p>把事業建立在正直，誠實的品格上的，才是鞏固，堅定，像直立在深谷大壑間的千年古樹，可以永垂不朽。所以，每個人都得保持自己正直，誠實的品格，就是犧牲了生命也所不惜。</p>
<p>也許，你可以記住的，「美的人格是世界最偉大的事業。」</p>
<h3 id="c71">二月份徴文錄取第九名　怎樣讀書？讀什麽書？ <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭植平</p>
<p>從來就有「十年窗下，埋頭苦讀」的書生，但所得的結果却是「愈讀愈愚」「愈讀愈惑；」更有自命資質超人的「優秀份子，」裝着「博覽羣籍」的模樣，但一經考究，却露出樣樣不通的狐狸尾巴來。這明顯地吿訴我們：讀書如不知道怎樣讀和讀什麽，即使費盡九牛二虎之力，也是徒然的。怎樣讀書？</p>
<p>（甲）技術　（一）各種器官的平均活動—古人的讀書祗講記憶。他們把經子史集之類背得爛爛熟，但對於內容却是漠然。這樣的讀書有什麽用呢？故而我們讀書時，應當將腦，眼，手，和嘴同時使用。用腦記憶，聯想，推想；用眼練習快讀；用手劃綫，做筆記；用嘴誦讀重要的句子。（二）精讀與略讀—書籍之多，汗牛充棟，除非是呆子才會用同樣的精力和時間去讀一切的書。所以對於某方面或某問題最基本的和最有價値的書，我們應該仔細地讀。而比較次要的書；祇需「觀其大略。」（三）批判和懷欵—讀書若祗講理解是不够的。我們應當更進一步的養成批判和懷疑的精神。（四）研究與寫作—讀了書不應用是很容易患「消化不良」症的。所以讀書之外，我們如碰到不甚瞭解或感到興趣的問題時，應該搜集些有關的資料，作一個有系統的研究。假使有興致，不妨將硏究的結果寫成文章。（五）集體學習—個人讀書，往往有偏於一隅，忽略疑難，沒有持久性等缺點。若要免去牠們，組織或加人讀書會是一服良劑。</p>
<p>（乙）環境　我們固然不必想望「明窗凈几」的境地，但倘能稍爲注意一下，總是有幫助的。</p>
<p>（丙）時間　大凡早晨腦力最健；用這時間來讀比較艱深的書（如哲學，）收効最著。飯後不宜用腦過度，可以讀些文藝作品。做筆記等較輕鬆的工作，最好留在晚間。</p>
<p>讀什麽書？</p>
<p>對於這問題，向來是議論紛紛的「開卷有益」派宣稱：凡是書，都是値得讀的；老古董主張：除掉能敎我們「明理」的「聖賢之書，」別的都應該擯棄；讀死書朋友却認爲學校課本就是整個天地……。到底誰對呢？都不對！在我們，學問是一種用來指導行動和改革世界的武器。所以我們應當讀活的，有用的書。凡是與這前提相違的書，不妨一脚踢開！</p>
<p>我們讀那些好？（甲）從一般到特殊：（一）在讀書的初期，我們必須接受各項基本知識，並且瞭解牠們間的聯繫。那是決不能馬虎的倘若不這樣做，以後無論幹什麽都會感到先天不足的。（二）在學習每一種學問時，我們必須按步就班地來。例如學習社會科學，起先應該讀些入門，敎程，大綱之類的書（自然要擇好的，）以明瞭一個大槪。</p>
<p>（乙）從現代到古代　舊學問在某種意義上也是有用的。不過這須在我們對現代的學識已經打下根基和養成批判習慣之後。</p>
<p>（丙）從好到壞　書的好壞是沒有絕對標準的。像歷朝所禁讀的「壞書，」在我們看來並不遜於欽定的「聖書。」而且，同樣一本書，對甲雖然有害，對乙却有很大的用處。祗須自己堅持着正確的立塲。</p>
<p>如果我們能把上面所說的融解在一個科學化的讀書計劃中，配合着康德似的規律化的生活，高爾基似的奮鬥精神和魯迅似的韌性，那麽成功是可以指望的。</p>
<p>最後，還得提醒一句：要與實踐打成一片！</p>

<p>我是第二次做人了，我曾經死去過，但是現在是復活了。先生你以爲奇怪嗎？死去了的人會得復活？現在我將這件事的經過完全告訴你：</p>
<p>我的丈夫叫高維仁，是一個銀樓裏的銀匠，因爲物價高昂的關係，收入總不敷支出，所以我常常幫着做生活計，又因身體虛弱，加以今春天氣忽寒忽熱，所以在半月前病倒了。當時連買米的錢都沒有，那裏來錢去醫病，惟有等待着死神的降臨，在寒食節那天曾昏過去一次，當時曾到海格路紅十字會醫院去，可是他們不肯收，因此就在四月十日早上七時斷了氣。我的丈夫就把我送到南市殯儀館去，因爲他還得籌齊成殮的錢，所以不在我的旁邊，在下午二點鐘的時候，我忽然醒了過來。雖然吃了殯儀館裏的雪水，然而危險時期依然沒有脫去，後來我的丈夫來了，他見我復活，當然是非常快活，馬上想請醫生診治，但是爲了沒有相當的醫生和錢，就由申報的胡先生介紹到愛文義路的宏仁醫院，而他們也不肯接收，我當然祇得回來，但是他們一定要五塊錢做掛號費，我想他們不收病人，却要五塊錢掛號費實在沒有理由。在回家的途中，經過中華路文廟路口徐甫道國藥號，那裏想起了中醫或許能够醫治，所以就請他們店裏介紹。結果在那裏的一位寗波醫生舒書雲先生，（診所在中華路安樂里三號）見義勇爲，替我診治，他說這是春溫傷寒症，他就開了藥方，並且對我說小要緊的，祇要兩三次一定可以脫去危險。他還說不要爲了沒有錢不吃藥，不找醫生醫治，我就告訴他前二次在醫院裏所受到的情形，他說不要緊，以後你來好了，我不要你一個錢，就這樣地我才得到服藥的機會。第二天，覺得好得多了依舊請這位舒醫生診治，這樣的一連三次，我的病是起色了，現在可以吃些稀飯，並且可以立立坐坐，我想危險期是過去了罷。舒先生也吿訴我危險境地是過去了，現在祇要好好地靜養，就可入良好的境界。</p>
<p>先生我又得到重做人的權利了，我是受盡了人間的苦楚，這次能够死而復生這第一當然要感謝這位見義勇爲的舒書雲醫生其决承各界熱心資助，也使我感激不盡。貧婦高阮氏敬上，住南市黃家闕路普餘里十九號。</p>
<p>各界捐助　高阮氏復活後，各界紛紛資助，昨接宋太太指助二百元，陳菊泉一百元（保養腹子用），業已代收。派人送往醫院面交本人。同時接盧沛涵君來函：謂高阮氏求治經過，與報載者略有出入，據稱：「高阮氏自殯儀館返家後，因病未愈，曾送往各醫院求治，奈各醫院惟利是圖，悉加拒絕，敝人聞之惻然，奈能力不足，偶與周寒影小姐談及此事，承周小姐亦願臂助，故即請莊堯聲先生助中儲券一百元，並由莊先生轉請潘太太，向仁濟堂董事謝駕千先生商懇函送國醫平民醫院，蒙該院慨然收容，免費診治」。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Thorough Investigation of Hoarding and Two Requests <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>We deeply feel that recently, prices of goods and the value of currency are rising incessantly, and the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult. At the same time, we have repeatedly received letters from various sectors expressing their distress about being unable to bear the burden of life and reporting the madness of speculators who hoard goods. They hope that we will voice justice and advocate on their behalf. We are filled with joy and gratitude, which cannot be expressed in words. Based on our observations, we convey public opinion and offer suggestions from various aspects, all to support the government's policies and alleviate the severity of high prices to win the trust of the people. However, after half a month of developments, we still believe that this major public case cannot be casually concluded. Perhaps the government currently has some unavoidable obstacles and is temporarily remaining silent. Before the government decides on a solution, we will speak frankly and directly, without any reservations or concealment, to earnestly seek the government's adoption. This is our attitude. Therefore, regarding this investigation of speculation and hoarding, we can only wait for the government's final and decisive action to be announced to the public.</p>
<p>There are still things we must say. While we will wait patiently for a solution, it is necessary to quickly establish measures to prevent speculation and hoarding in order to learn from past mistakes. If the investigation of hoarding involves too many parties and cannot be decisively dealt with, the following two matters can be implemented immediately:</p>
<p>(1) Separation of Officials and Merchants: Simply put, if you are an official, you are not allowed to engage in commerce; if you are engaged in commerce, you are not allowed to be an official. Some people serve in the Ministry of Finance while directly or indirectly participating in commercial banks. Or, some people work in national banks while also holding positions in commercial banks. This is just one example. Even if those who are officials and also engage in business are not suspected of speculation and hoarding, they still contradict the government's decree that "civil servants are not allowed to engage in business," leaving no room for excuses or explanations. Therefore, we sincerely request the government to issue a strict order, setting a deadline, and requiring civil servants to examine themselves and voluntarily resign from either their official or commercial positions, focusing on one area. Those who do not resign by the deadline will be subject to disciplinary action once discovered.</p>
<p>(2) National Banks Should Have Standards for Lending: The scope of business operations for national banks is clearly defined in the "Central Reserve Bank Law." Article 26 of the law provides restrictions on operations, with Section 2 stating: "The total amount of loans, rediscounts, or other advances to private individuals, companies, or other private legal entities, and the purchase of their drafts, checks, or other negotiable instruments, shall not exceed 500,000 yuan per entity..." Section 7 states: "No credit loans or overdrafts shall be made." Section 8 states: "No operations of a speculative nature shall be conducted." In recent years, many new small banks have been established in Shanghai. It is rumored that many of them have credit loans and overdrafts with the Central Reserve Bank due to certain special relationships, and the amount of these loans reaches millions or more. We ask, what standards do these newly established small banks meet to obtain loans? After obtaining loans, are they used to support industry and commerce or to engage in speculation and hoarding? We certainly have no way of knowing the actual business and accounting situation of the Central Reserve Bank and cannot definitively say that this is happening. As the saying goes, "There is no smoke without fire." We would like to borrow a common phrase from official documents: "Correct it if it exists, and be vigilant if it does not." We hope that the bank will be cautious in its lending. At the same time, we hope that the government authorities in charge will closely investigate the bank's lending operations to ensure they are legal and supervise them at all times to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>The Control Yuan, the highest supervisory body of the central government, has the power to impeach and audit according to law. Control Yuan members may individually propose impeachment for illegal or derelict behavior by civil servants. We hope that the Control Yuan authorities will pay attention to this investigation of hoarding. When necessary, based on the special powers granted by the government, they should not be afraid of trouble or show any hesitation, and after confirming the facts of the matter, they should file an impeachment, using the Control Yuan's independent position to exert the effectiveness of the supervisory power and fulfill the supervisory responsibility.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that if the government wants to strengthen its political position, it must first gain the unanimous trust of the people. Gaining the people's trust can only be achieved by improving their livelihoods. Currently, solving the price problem is the most effective way to improve the people's livelihood. At the same time, cracking down on speculation and hoarding is the most urgent and effective way to solve the price problem. We believe that the wise authorities have long understood this. Today, we must reiterate two points: First, we await the results of the thorough investigation of hoarding to reassure the public. Second, we must strictly prevent the recurrence of speculation and hoarding in the future to avoid causing great suffering to the public.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Desperation of Enemy Tactics <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Our Japanese people need no further examples from foreign countries to prove how base and cruel the enemy's methods of warfare are. However, the bombings that the enemy is now inflicting on European countries not only demonstrate their increasingly exposed cruelty and inferior national character, but also show that in order to reverse their losing situation to their advantage, they are resorting to methods that are condemned by both gods and men. They are carrying out brutal blind bombing not only against Germany and Italy, but also against France, the Netherlands, and Belgium. No, it cannot simply be called blind bombing; it is simply a planned bombing of non-combatant civilians. Judging from the bombing targets they are currently implementing in Europe, it is so. Judging from the behavior of the American planes that attacked Japan around this time last year—for example, indiscriminately bombing schools knowing that they were schools—it is also so.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, the British Air Minister, Sinclair, recently made the outrageous statement that "the results of the British Air Force's war are determined by the extent of the damage to residential areas." People often thought that the British were cruel, which was common knowledge, but that no matter how cruel they were, they were still a step behind the Americans. However, after hearing Sinclair's words, one must realize that there is absolutely no difference between Americans and British, and there is no room for doubt. If the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy were to retaliate with the same methods when the United States and Britain resorted to such extremely despicable methods of attack, there would be nothing wrong with it. However, what justification can be given for the fact that the United States and Britain are planning to bomb civilians who are neutral, like the French? For example, after the French military authorities declared Paris a non-defended city, even the German army, which was at war, respected it. However, the British Air Force began bombing Paris after France had returned to a neutral position. Furthermore, the number of cities targeted for bombing is increasing daily. The damage suffered by the western and northwestern cities below Rouen is extremely tragic. Moreover, this trend has intensified recently, and news has come that they are indiscriminately bombing residential areas in Paris again. It is only natural that the French people are expressing hatred and anger over this, and they have filed a complaint with the International Red Cross in the name of the nation, questioning the intentions of the United States and Britain toward France. Furthermore, judging from the bombing of innocent civilians in small countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands, is this the war morality practiced by great powers?</p>
<p>The United States and Britain are now disregarding war morality. During the previous World War, the American army was completely ignorant of war morality, and this opinion was shared by both enemies and friends. But today, the British army has also become like the American army, indiscriminately disregarding war morality. Their bombing of France, the Netherlands, and Belgium is not only due to their cruelty, but also a means with a certain purpose. That purpose may be to drive these people to revolt, or at least it is a foolish plan to incite great chaos, or perhaps they are foolishly thinking that this will somehow be advantageous to their landing operations on the European continent. In short, there is no doubt that it is out of some purpose.</p>
<p>Expediting the opening of the current war situation is an urgent matter for the United States and Britain. The German-Soviet front will continue in its current state and enter the summer war. The northern front will soon enter the hot season when fighting is impossible, facing a bleak future. Therefore, their anxiety is clearly visible. However, it is also foreseeable that as their anxiety increases, they will increasingly resort to desperate violence. We can also infer the enemy's plans to invade the sacred land of Japan according to the standards mentioned above. Therefore, we should have a deep awareness to prepare for it, and we should remember that the enemy does not care about war morality, and no matter what they do, we must not regard it as unexpected.

<h3 id="e3">Japanese Aircraft Active in the Pacific, Guadalcanal Island Bombed, Australian Prime Minister Curtin Appeals to the United States, Current Air Force Strength Insufficient for Defense <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency): According to Washington reports, the U.S. Navy Department announced yesterday that Japanese planes attacked U.S. military positions on Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands on Friday night, causing significant property damage and casualties.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 19th (Central News Agency): According to news received here, the Australian government recently echoed the call of Allied Supreme Commander MacArthur, requesting the Washington Joint Chiefs of Staff to send air force units to reinforce Australia. However, the U.S. government repeatedly insisted on the measures agreed upon at the Quebec Conference and did not comply with the request. As a result, the opinions of U.S. Navy Secretary Knox and MacArthur became increasingly divergent. In a broadcast address to the nation on the evening of the 18th, Australian Prime Minister Curtin pointed out the threat of the Japanese army, saying that Roosevelt and Churchill had decided on a global strategy at the Quebec Conference, and Australia would immediately act in accordance with this decision. As a result, Australia consumed a great deal of resources and combat power in various aspects, and mobilized as much as possible in other departments. Therefore, the people should know that the difficulties in the future will definitely increase and should redouble their efforts. I would like to reiterate to the Allied nations that the Australian government highly approves of the global strategy decided at the Quebec Conference, that is, we agree to use Australia as the base for launching offensives after defeating the German army. However, this does not mean that the amount of military supplies and especially military aircraft shipped to Australia is small. Even the current amount is good for a protracted war in the Southwest Pacific. For example, when Japanese planes bombed Milne Bay last week, although the Allied Air Force took off to counterattack, many Japanese planes ignored the Allied planes' interception and finally flew over the target area to complete their mission. The so-called mission was to sink our valuable ships. Although the Allied forces want to launch a counterattack against the Japanese army, there has been no opportunity to do so. Moreover, each Japanese air raid makes Australia feel deeply threatened, and the increase in air force strength is also being depleted. Therefore, Australia is facing a great crisis, which the people should not ignore.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Allied Air Force Ace, MacKay Killed in Action <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 18th (Central News Agency): The Japanese army's continuous fierce bombing of Allied bases in the Southwest Pacific has caused the Allied forces to be extremely panicked. Recently, it has been rumored that Allied bombing ace Major General MacKay was killed in an airplane collision on Yuga Island. Regarding this news, the Australian Allied Command Headquarters recently issued the following statement: Major MacKay, the bombing king of the Southwest Pacific, recently died in battle for no reason. It is said that when MacKay set off for a bombing mission last week, a team of aircraft from Yuga flew off the runway and collided with his plane, causing the plane to immediately overturn. All the bombs on board exploded, so Major MacKay and all the pilots on board were killed in the explosion.</p>

In the evening, at 7:00 PM, Ambassador Shiozawa hosted a banquet at his residence to entertain Zhou.</p>
<p>Beijing, 19th (Central News Agency): Zhou Fohai, the National Government's Special Envoy to Manchukuo, has completed his mission to Manchukuo and departed for home. He arrived in Beijing on the 19th and immediately sent telegrams to Manchukuo Prime Minister Zhang, Foreign Minister Li, and Commander Umezu of the Kwantung Army to express his thanks. The telegram read: (Titles omitted) "During this visit to Manchukuo, I was honored to receive your care and assistance, which enabled me to complete my mission. I am also grateful for the banquet and the opportunity to hear your insightful opinions. I have now arrived safely in Beijing. Please rest assured and I wish you good health. Respectfully, Zhou Fohai."</p>
<p>Statement Before Leaving Manchukuo</p>
<p>Dalian, 19th (Central News Agency): Zhou Fohai, our country's Special Envoy to Manchukuo, issued a statement before leaving Manchukuo to return home, clarifying the determination of China, Japan, and Manchukuo to cooperate in completing the war. The gist of the statement was as follows: "During my visit to Manchukuo, I received a warm welcome from the government and people of Manchukuo, as well as the Kwantung Army, and was immediately granted all kinds of conveniences for my inspection, which enabled me to complete my mission. I am truly grateful. I previously issued a statement upon my arrival in your country, stating that my mission in visiting your country was twofold: (1) to promote the unity of China and Manchukuo in order to cooperate with our ally Japan in completing the Greater East Asia War, and (2) to inspect the state of your country's economic construction over the past decade. Although I was only in Xinjing from the 9th to Dalian on the 16th, for only eight days, I gained a great deal, which was unexpected. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the government and people of Manchukuo, as well as the Kwantung Army. The completion of the Greater East Asia War requires both spiritual and material strength. Now I know that Manchukuo, like China and Japan, has the same determination and belief to strive for victory with the Axis powers, with one heart and one mind, united as one. This is proof that Manchukuo already possesses spiritual strength. I have visited Jilin, Harbin, Fengtian, Lushun, Anshan, and other places and witnessed the scale and progress of the military industrial facilities in those places. This is proof that Manchukuo already possesses material strength. The East Asian Axis has such great and powerful spiritual and material strength, and I am confident that the final victory will belong to us. During this visit, I believe that our future prospects are unlimited and that we can achieve a bright future. Therefore, we must continue to work harder to achieve the final victory as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Talk to Reporters</p>
<p>Beijing, 19th (Central News Agency): After our country's Special Envoy Zhou Fohai and his entourage arrived in the ancient capital, he met with newspaper reporters at the Qin Zheng Hall in Zhongnanhai at 4:00 PM and issued a statement, the gist of which was as follows: "North China must be North China of the Central Government, and the Central Government must be the Central Government of North China. The people under the rule of the National Government, regardless of region, should hold firm to their beliefs and move forward courageously, especially at a time when the final victory of the Greater East Asia War still requires our efforts. We should unite externally and unify internally. We must thoroughly realize that dispersion leads to weakness and concentration leads to strength. If our country cooperates with our ally Japan with dispersed strength, the effect will be minimal. Therefore, in order to fulfill the sacred mission that China bears, we should adjust the form of separation and dispersion and create a situation of national unity to become a strong partner of our ally Japan and a strong link in the Greater East Asia Axis. We must not only understand the current situation in East Asia and the world, but also understand that this war is a sacred war fought by our Axis countries for justice and righteousness. Our ally Japan, based on a spirit of righteousness, took the lead in returning the concessions and leased territories in our country and abolished extraterritoriality in China, allowing us to complete our mission of striving for independence, freedom, and liberation, making us feel that the future is infinitely bright. Today, seeing the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun fluttering in the area of the former embassies of Great Britain and the United States in China is especially encouraging. However, the remaining forces of Great Britain and the United States have not been completely eliminated, and the final victory still requires our efforts. I dare to tell my compatriots that if we want to achieve this goal, we can only strive for unity externally, making the East Asian Axis as strong as iron and stone, and use all the manpower and material resources of East Asia to carry out the war. Then, the surrender of Great Britain and the United States can be expected, and the victory of the war can be expected. As for the country, if we can cooperate strongly and work together with Japan to liberate East Asia, we can only make up for the shortcomings of fragmentation and dispersion and become a unified country that lives up to its name. We dare to believe that the people of the country will agree with this. Wise men in China and Japan may ask me, what is the Central Government's plan for the construction of the North? I dare to answer that the Central Government has never forgotten everything in the North. However, in the past, due to lack of strength, it has not been able to provide much support for the construction of the North. In the future, regarding the exchange of materials and the regulation of finance, as long as the Central Government is able to do so, it will do its best to improve the lives of the people in the North. I have not been to the North for three years. This time, I plan to exchange views with the authorities in North China and the allied authorities in North China on issues such as stabilizing the people's livelihood in China and strengthening China's combat power so that China can fulfill its responsibilities in the Greater East Asia War, and the people's livelihood in China can become more stable day by day. This time, I was sent to visit Manchukuo and was warmly welcomed by the government and people of Manchukuo. I am deeply grateful. After inspecting various places, I saw the rapid progress of their various constructions and deeply respect the painstaking efforts of the authorities. At the same time, I also feel that the urgency of developing our country's industry is becoming more and more urgent."</p>

In the past, Ambassador Stahmer and Chargé d'Affaires Göthe had a deep understanding of the East Asian situation and made great contributions to promoting friendship between China and Germany. Now, Dr. Wörmann, who succeeds as Ambassador to China, will also be able to use his experience and knowledge in the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promote the increase of friendly relations between China and Germany. At present, our ally Germany is bravely fighting against communism and British and American imperialism in Europe and has achieved the foundation for victory. At the same time, the construction of the new order in Europe is also progressing under the efforts of our ally Germany, in order to promote the world's permanent peace. Since our country declared war on Great Britain and the United States on January 9th this year, we have been working closely with our ally Japan to eliminate the forces of British and American aggression in East Asia over the past century and to advance the construction of the new order in Greater East Asia, so that the world's overall peace, which is in line with justice, will be established at an early date. Both sides' efforts are completely consistent, and it is deeply believed that after the new Ambassador Dr. Wörmann comes to China, he will be able to make great contributions to the cooperation and communication in the construction of the new order in the East and West."</p>

<p>Nantong, 19th (Central News Agency): The Communist bandits have a joint defense office in Tonghai, which is under the command of Wen Wenwei. The director of the office, Tang Jingyan, who is also the leader of the people's self-defense corps, has always been quite dissatisfied with the Communist Party's deceptive policies. Since the start of the "Purification of the Countryside" in northern Jiangsu, Tang has decided to break away from the Communist Party and join the peace movement. On the night of the 15th of this month, at 2:00 AM, he led the security team of the joint defense office to attack the bandit troops, but they were defeated. Tang's troops have now defected to the special work zone in northern Jiangsu. This move will definitely provide great assistance to the future of the "Purification of the Countryside" work in northern Jiangsu.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) – Recognizing that the Ministry of Industries' responsibilities are closely related to the people's livelihood, the reporter visited Yuan Yuquan, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industries, to understand relevant industrial issues during wartime. He answered the various industrial questions as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) How can industry be revitalized to adapt to the wartime system? (Answer) To revitalize industry, a reasonable system of control is essential. The government's priority is to adjust past control methods to make them more reasonable while strengthening industrial and commercial organizations, such as trade associations. The recently established National Commercial Control Association is part of the adjustment efforts. The most important aspect of industry is solving the people's clothing and food problems. The Ministry's primary focus will be on increasing the production of cotton, hemp, wool, and other fabric products to meet the people's clothing and food needs.</p>
<p>(Question) How should our country revitalize the military-managed factories returned by friendly nations and resume production? (Answer) Regarding the factory issue, the authorities are currently developing a comprehensive plan, with the restoration of factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places as the first step. However, the two major problems of raw materials and fuel must be resolved first, so the government is actively seeking ways to increase production to solve the fuel shortage. Although raw materials for various paper industries are currently difficult, we must also actively seek to increase production. However, at present, we can only strive to ensure a self-sufficient supply of industrial raw materials.</p>
<p>(Question) How can prices be suppressed and illegitimate business practices such as speculation and hoarding be stopped? (Answer) The authorities are currently working on adjusting commercial institutions while guiding idle capital in the market to engage in productive enterprises. The urgent task is to bring the movement of funds in the market onto the right track, and the speculative atmosphere can be gradually eliminated.</p>
<p>(Question) The cooperative business of consumer co-ops seems to be insufficient at present. What countermeasures does the authorities have to adjust it? (Answer) At present, general prices are too high, and the purchasing power of the general public is weak. The palliative measure is to have economical consumption. As for the fundamental solution, of course, we must quickly enrich rural finance and increase production so that the supply and demand of living materials can be balanced, and prices can be stabilized.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Financial Control Association held its first general meeting at the Banking Association Hall here at 10:00 AM today. More than 250 officials and members attended the meeting. Minister of Finance Kaya, Director of the Banking Bureau Yamagiwa, and other related officials from the Japanese government were present. First, Chairman Yuki reported on the business and accounting situation for the Showa 17th year (1942). The meeting began at 11:00 AM. First, a resolution of gratitude to the Japanese army was passed, followed by a speech by Chairman Yuki. Then, Minister of Finance Kaya delivered a financial and fiscal speech. After the speech, everyone had lunch and adjourned at 1:00 PM. In his speech, Chairman Yuki stated that the Financial Control Association has been studying and implementing various measures to improve the operations of financial institutions, especially regarding the centralized settlement of domestic remittances, which will soon be implemented by the Bank of Japan. The centralized settlement of domestic remittances in Japan will be implemented starting April 1st of this year. Here is a summary of Minister of Finance Kaya's speech: The government set a savings target of 2.3 billion yen for the Showa 17th year last spring. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the national people, the results exceeded the target. The target amount for the Showa 18th year (1943) is 2.7 billion yen, of which 2.1 billion yen will be digested when various financial institutions and government agencies absorb funds. To increase national savings, the government is implementing various bills passed by the 80th Diet. The government's reason for allowing ordinary banks to engage in both savings bank business and trust business is also to increase national savings. The government, facing the increasing importance of enhancing savings and appropriate bank funds, will not adhere to past policies and will reform financial institutions that should be reformed to maximize the functions of financial institutions. During this decisive phase, the economic situation is constantly changing, and the financial sector is constantly facing new problems. Therefore, each financial control group should mobilize subordinate agencies to cooperate with the government and quickly establish solutions to these problems.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Macau Correspondence A Glimpse of Zhengzhou, Xuchang, and Luohe, Three Important Towns in Central Henan on the Pinghan Railway <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Xian Zhang</p>
<p>Henan, formerly known as Zhongzhou, is a land of four battles. Zhengzhou, Xuchang, and Luohe, the three military towns in central Henan along the Pinghan Railway, are at the crossroads of east-west and north-south traffic. During the times of military conflicts throughout history, the safety and gain or loss of these places often determined the future of the overall situation.</p>
<p>Before the war, Zhengzhou was the largest commercial port in Henan. After the outbreak of the war, although it was affected by the Yellow River breach and the dismantling of railways, the average value of goods imported from the east bank of the Yellow River every day last spring was over 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>Before the war, Xuchang was the export hub of tobacco from Xuchang, Xiangcheng, Jiaxian, Wuoyang, Yexian and other areas. After the war, although the railways were dismantled, on the other hand, Xiangcheng, because it is located on the south side of the Ru River, ships can directly reach Bengbu, taking over Xuchang's pre-war position. However, there are as many as dozens of machine-made cigarette factories in Xuchang, which are still second to none in the counties of central Henan. Yucheng Tobacco Factory, famous for making Lingjian brand cigarettes, had a capital of only 2,000 yuan at the beginning of the war, but has now accumulated to 20 million yuan, and pays tens of thousands of yuan in taxes every month, which is really a ten-thousand-fold profit.</p>
<p>Luohe and Yancheng (ancient Shaoling) face each other across the Sha River. Because it and Zhumadian are distribution centers for soybeans and sesame in the counties of central Henan, after the Pinghan Railway was opened to traffic, in just thirty or forty years, it and Huiyuanzhai to the south of the station merged into one, developing into a city that stretches for five li. Because it is located on the Sha River, ships can directly reach Jieshou and Bengbu, and cars can also go east to Jieshou, Fuyang, Guoyang, and Haocheng, northwest to Luoyang and Xi'an, and southwest to Fuyang and Laohekou. Therefore, after the war, it replaced Zhengzhou's position and replaced it. In the 29th year of the Republic (1940), the average daily transaction volume reached about 5 million yuan. The old railway platform has all become bustling commercial areas.</p>
<p>Since Zhengzhou was lost once last autumn and material blockade was intensified, the function of the three towns as supply lines to the rear has gradually been lost. Zhengzhou has become a dead market due to the strict blockade of the river by both sides. Many shops in Xuchang have also closed, and Luohe shares the same fate with Jieshou. In addition, Henan has suffered from two seasons of famine this year, especially in central Henan. Local trade has also declined sharply. Looking back at the prosperity of the three towns a year or two ago, it really feels like a different world.</p>
<p>Traveling in the central Henan area also evokes a sense of nostalgia. Zhengzhou and Xinzheng were the sites of the ancient Zheng state and the focus of the Jin-Chu rivalry. The small country was located between two major powers, and its situation was very pitiful. Xuchang is where Cao Cao forced Emperor Xian of Han to move the capital. To this day, the altar where he received the abdication and the sign where he received the abdication still exist (recently, the local people burned four-fifths of the bottom of the stele because the officials ordered them to copy it without restraint). The bones of Cao Cao and his sons have already decayed. Going west from Xuchang to Xiangyang and Yexian, there is the place where Guan Gong挑锦袍, 　谷旧地, Yingkaoshu's tomb, Li Ying's tomb, Changju and Jieni plowing together, the place where Zilu asked for directions, the former Yingchuan county to the south, and the tombs of the Han Xun family's eight dragons to the north, full of ancient charm, like a person in a historical scene. Compared with traveling in the south, which is richer from an economic point of view, it is as interesting as seeing 横波沙 at the time of the Han Dynasty from an archaeological point of view.

<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Today's Berlin news: The Axis forces have greatly increased their strength, and all anti-Axis offensives in the Bega and Mejez El-Bab areas of Tunisia have been repelled. A surprise attack by German and Italian forces has defeated the concentrated enemy forces. The Axis forces have captured a total of 63 people, 2 anti-aircraft guns, and many heavy infantry weapons. There have only been small-scale offensives in other parts of the front, and the Axis positions have continued to be strengthened. According to the communication from a British visitor in North Africa, the Axis counterattack will soon be realized. German Lieutenant General Arning has transferred a large number of reinforcements to the Mejez el-Bab area, and the Axis forces are now preparing to launch a large-scale offensive from this area. There is fierce fighting along the road from Fondouk to Tunis. The German army has skillfully set up a machine gun network, and the British and American forces have suffered heavy losses. Eisenhower told British reporters that the German army has laid hundreds of thousands of mines in the war zone, making anti-Axis operations difficult. It is reported that the British Eighth Army is currently moving along a front of about 30 miles between the mountains and Enfidaville. Both sides' air forces are very active due to the clear weather.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – The front-line correspondent of the German News Agency reported on the Tunisian war situation on the 18th as follows: The Axis positions in Tunisia are becoming increasingly strengthened, and the Rommel and Arnim armies have completed joint operations. Due to the meeting of the two armies, the new combat power of the Axis forces has been greatly strengthened. On the 17th, in addition to repelling the anti-Axis forces in the Benghia and Mejez El-Bab areas, the French rebel forces who attacked the Axis positions were completely repelled. The Axis combat units, with the close assistance of dive bomber squadrons and fighter squadrons, have completed a strong defense line and closely monitored all anti-Axis attack attempts. According to the German military authorities, German fighters engaged in a magnificent air battle with the anti-Axis air force bombing fighter formation over the Mediterranean Sea on the 17th, resulting in the downing of eight enemy aircraft, including five four-engine bombers.</p>

<p>Rome, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Italian military headquarters announced on the 18th that after the Italian escort convoy's fast艇隊 attacked two British destroyers and sunk one of them, the Stefani News Agency published a detailed report on the battle, stating that two Italian fast艇十五日were escorting transport ships to Tunisia at night when they suddenly discovered two large enemy destroyers. They started attacking them regardless of everything and launched a fierce naval battle. As a result, one Italian fast艇struck an enemy bullet and sank. At the same time, one enemy destroyer was severely attacked by the Italian艇and was unable to move. According to the reconnaissance by Axis Italian aircraft on the morning of the 16th, it was proven that the ship exploded and sank near the battlefield. Another enemy destroyer was hit by several bullets and sailed towards Malta. The Italian escort convoy was not hindered in any way and arrived in Tunis at the scheduled time. In this battle, in addition to one Italian fast艇sinking, another was slightly injured and safely returned to base.</p>

<p>Rome, 19th (Central News Agency) – Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini delivered a speech yesterday at the Fascist Party's cabinet meeting discussing the budget: The political goal of the Axis powers is to implement the rights of all nationalities to respect each other and cooperate, and to seek free development based on the fair distribution of raw materials. The importance of the meeting between the two leaders of Germany and Italy is well known. Italy, which is fighting, is not seeking new solutions or striving for abstract ideas. We have no real freedom if we do not have the freedom to work according to our needs. Our goal is to strive for this freedom, which is our right.</p>

<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – The German leader's headquarters announced on the 18th that Hungarian Regent Horthy visited Hitler's headquarters on the 16th to exchange views on military, political, and other issues. The talks lasted for two days.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to Haisong News: The summit meeting between the leaders of Germany and Hungary has confirmed the traditional friendship between the two countries and their spirit of fighting together. The two countries have now decided to fight until victory is achieved, and the general suspicion of Hungary's attitude by enemy countries can also be dispelled. In the past, Reuters of the United Kingdom repeatedly spread rumors that once the United Kingdom and the United States invaded Southeast Europe, the Hungarian army would not fight against the United Kingdom and the United States; or that after the United Kingdom and the United States landed in Southeast Europe, Hungary would withdraw the Hungarian army fighting on the Eastern Front. The British side also made empty promises to establish the Balkan Pact, which also included an independent Hungary. This kind of divisive trick was the same as dealing with Yugoslavia, with Mihailovic's rebel army as the vanguard of the anti-Axis invasion army. However, since the complete failure of the rebel army, the enemy's wishful thinking of Hungary's separate peace has been shattered. Then, the United Kingdom and the United States made other attempts, saying that although Hungary was willing to resist Bolshevism, it had no intention of resisting the British and American armies. After Hitler's meeting with the Hungarian Regent, the enemy's various plans completely failed. The enemy's political conspiracy can never divide the strong front of the Axis powers in Southeast Europe. Hungary, Italy, and Romania have now made it clear that they will not stop the war unless victory is achieved. Moreover, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are the same enemies, because their goals are to destroy Europe.</p>

<p>Rangoon, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After returning to Burma from a visit to Japan, Burmese Administrative Chief Ba Maw visited the Shwedagon Pagoda and convened a meeting of ministers to prepare for national construction. He also spoke to reporters about his impressions of visiting Japan, saying: "I am deeply grateful for the warm welcome I received from all levels of Japanese society during my visit. I have long admired the great spirit of unity among the Japanese people under His Majesty the Emperor. This time, I was able to truly experience this characteristic, which is a beauty of Japan. When I visited the Ise Grand Shrine, I saw the simple wooden shrine and recalled that it has been praised as the most sublime building in the world, and I deeply agree. Japanese women have an unadorned beauty, and their clothing colors are extremely harmonious. The tea ceremony and dramas during banquets are also exquisite. All this unadorned beauty, as a result of its development, forms the true Japanese concept of morality. As for Japan's strength, I found the reason among the youth in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and other places. For example, when I visited a factory in Tokyo, I saw industrial soldiers working diligently under accurate and disciplined training. When I visited the youth school in the factory, I saw thousands of young people immediately marching in orderly columns upon hearing the teacher's command. I was deeply amazed by such training. From this, I know that Japan is invincible not only in its military, but also in its young industrial warriors who bear the heavy responsibility of production. This kind of national unified group training is the best proof that Japan has the strength to complete the Greater East Asia War."</p>

<p>Hong Kong, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Governor Isogai of Hong Kong met with a group of reporters today and spoke about the state of Hong Kong's construction, saying: "As a person in charge of Hong Kong's construction, there are still unsatisfactory aspects. However, the recent construction has improved, which is a fact. (1) 'Hong Kong's position as a liaison port in the Co-Prosperity Sphere' Since April, all materials transported to various parts of South China have been unloaded in Hong Kong first, and then transferred to Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and other places. Therefore, we are actively preparing warehouses and port facilities. Currently, the materials concentrated in Hong Kong are rice, flour, and coal, but we want Hong Kong to become not only a liaison port for South China, but also to develop into a liaison port for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. (2) 'Return to Hometown Work' The return to hometown work implemented to disperse the surplus population in Hong Kong is still progressing smoothly. So far, the results of returning to the hometown are not very significant in terms of numbers, but there has been great progress in terms of quality. Furthermore, the previous tendency for special technical personnel needed in Hong Kong to leave has completely disappeared. (3) 'Construction of Machinery Sailing Ships' The first sailing ship built here is fully equipped and has already set sail. Now is the time to increase transportation capacity, so it is gratifying to have this transport ship set sail. (4) 'Efforts to Achieve Self-Sufficiency in Machinery' The most necessary thing for the construction of various industries is machinery, so we must first make every effort to achieve self-sufficiency and then establish pharmaceutical factories, using South China iron ore and planning to manufacture machinery."</p>

<p>Hanoi, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the beginning of this year, various agreements have been successively concluded between Japan and Vietnam, so the relationship between the two countries is becoming closer. It is generally believed that after the return of Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Yoshizawa, the ties between the two countries will be further strengthened in politics, economy, and culture. After Ambassador Yoshizawa's return to office, he declared that the relationship between Japan and Vietnam would not change, so the friendly relations between the two countries would be further enhanced in the political field. In addition, the problems between China and Vietnam and other issues are still waiting for the cooperation of Vietnam. In the economic field, the economic agreement concluded on March 4 of this year can be applied, and at the same time, trade between Vietnam and China can be reopened, and rice can be transported to China, and trade to the south can be opened to create a new situation for the Vietnamese economy. In addition, regarding Vietnam's production undertakings, on the one hand, production can be increased, and at the same time, cooperation with Japan can actively revitalize enterprises and light industry.</p>

<h3 id="e39">The Truth About British and American Propaganda Strategies <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The enemy's British and American propaganda strategies, after five years of war and more than a year of the Greater East Asia War, have now become a wing of the so-called political offensive, revealing their sharp edge more and more. Since the beginning of this year, they have spread so-called postwar border issues, economic, monetary, food issues, national issues, etc. to the world. The countless hundreds of "postwar plans" are, needless to say, large-scale strategies of the British and American factions. During the First World War, they drove their so-called "Fourth Army" of propaganda strategies. Regardless of the continued defeats of the army, navy, and air force, they finally used the power of this Fourth Army to overthrow the Second German Empire. Based on this experience, they still hope to use this Fourth Army to achieve "final victory." How is their Fourth Army disguised now, and how are they using cunning tactics to manipulate the world? Below, we will expose the lineup and tactics of their Fourth Army, so that we can strengthen our ideological war and counterintelligence war.</p>
<h3 id="e40">British Propaganda Strategies: New Tactics Using Radio Waves and Leaflets <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent Hishiya from Stockholm, Sweden, 9th) Since Lord Northcliffe during the First World War, the British strategy headquarters, which has become the so-called official propaganda strategy base, is now located in the Ministry of Information, and is under the full control of the veteran journalist Brendan Bracken. This Ministry of Information advertised the quick victory in North Africa last year, but due to Rommel's preemptive strike, taking the lead over the anti-Axis forces and occupying the key point of El Alamein, it made a mess and caused a major reshuffle of the headquarters. Now, under Bracken's leadership, they are deploying a tightly knit formation. The main work of the Ministry of Information is to engage in radio broadcasting, manage news, and carry out propaganda strategies for Axis-occupied areas and neutral countries.</p>
<p>The Only Weapon of the Fourth Army - Radio Broadcasting</p>
<p>Now, Britain is using radio broadcasting as a weapon to spread its strategic radio waves to West Asia, East Asia, Central and South America, North America, Africa, etc. The BBC (London) broadcasting station for Europe uses the languages of about 20 countries, speaking tirelessly from morning to night. Among the British broadcasts to Europe, the most ingenious and vicious strategies are the following three:</p>
<p>First, the so-called "Gustav Siegfried Eins" broadcasting station. In fact, it is broadcast by the BBC broadcasting station in London. In short, it is said to be "a secret transmitting device installed somewhere in Germany or its occupied territories," but in fact, it is using the same wavelength as German domestic radio to spread rumors in an attempt to disrupt and shake German rear forces. Of course, the German people will not be fooled by them. However, their persistence is indeed terrifying.</p>
<p>Second, the evil plan of Catholic broadcasting. To give an example: Recently, targeting listeners of Catholic broadcasts in Germany, they suddenly impersonated Vatican (Roman Papal See) broadcasts, making great speeches slandering German leaders, and also interspersed with classical music embellishments. This kind of mischief, rather than making pious believers angry, makes them dumbfounded. Their vicious impersonation and pretense have caused the Vatican to deeply detest them.</p>
<p>Third, the BBC uses the national languages of a batch of German-occupied areas, such as French, Norwegian, and Flemish, to broadcast. In the middle of these broadcasts, they often suddenly announce important news, or say that the exiled emperor of the occupied country "will return home tomorrow morning," or say that "British and American troops will land somewhere in the German-occupied territory on a certain day." This kind of nonsense is a bit like secret communication, hoping to confuse the people's minds in the occupied territories.</p>
<p>Air Dropping Forged Meat Purchase Vouchers</p>
<p>British newspapers, under the instructions of the authorities, often write extensively with text that stirs up the people's awareness of resistance to war, but they have always used the reason of defaming Germany to talk nonsense about their German air force's full-scale air raids on the British mainland, which has instead relaxed the people's awareness of resistance to war. Now they also feel that this method is not right, so they have launched a movement to incite the people, and recently put forward the slogan of "long-term war," saying that "our future is more and more eventful," and changed their attitude of editing guidance.</p>
<p>They have already learned that the old method of using airplanes to drop leaflets over occupied areas is not very effective, so recently they have started to use bundled leaflets to throw. These leaflets say: "The threat of German submarines has recently been greatly reduced, so the food transport to the British mainland is extremely smooth, and this cream is distributed to you," etc. They also drop forged meat ration vouchers from the air in an attempt to disrupt the rationing front.</p>
<p>British and American embassies in neutral countries are issuing daily propaganda bulletins and other pamphlets, revealing information favorable to the anti-Axis countries. The British side has also set up special agencies for cultural propaganda, especially importing books and holding gatherings of famous musicians, scientists, and writers as a new means of appeasement. The propaganda power of British and American films should not be ignored either.</p>
<p>A famous British diplomat who attended the Versailles Conference once lamented:</p>
<p>"Although propaganda is a powerful and indispensable weapon for victory, it cannot be easily overlooked that propaganda has greatly harmed postwar peace on the other hand. That is because the exaggeration of propaganda has made the enemy's hatred between the nations deeply rooted, and can never be eliminated." This is his criticism that during the last war, the British propaganda camp created the absurd rumor that "Germans even eat the meat of corpses because of insufficient food," which planted the roots of postwar disaster. Now, the British (and of course the American) propaganda camp, regardless of such lessons, is still indescribably vicious; in order to win, they can say anything extremely evil, exposing the Anglo-Saxon demonic nature to the fullest.</p>
<p>The General Staff That Plots Conspiracies and Assassinations</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned Ministry of Information, Britain also has a special agency called the Intelligence Bureau. This Intelligence Bureau can be regarded as the central hub of British anti-enemy strategies, not inferior to the Ministry of Information, but jointly governed by the diplomatic, naval, and air forces. Apart from the director, Vansittart, probably no one knows its organization. On the eve of the outbreak of this war, the British Foreign Office was kept in the dark about major events such as the German-Soviet non-aggression pact and Yugoslavia's participation in the Tripartite Pact until the countries concerned announced them, and was severely attacked by the parliament. Therefore, Britain has devoted extraordinary efforts to strengthening the Intelligence Bureau since then, and now it can boast of being "the first in Europe." Its appearance can be easily imagined from the following events.</p>
<p>The attempted assassination of Führer Hitler in Munich in November 1939 at "Bürgerbräukeller." In 1940, British merchant Rickman and advertising agent Bicks conspired to blow up Swedish steel factories and port facilities in an attempt to prevent Swedish steel from being transported to Germany, and were discovered and imprisoned. In 1941, the luggage of the Yugoslav embassy in England suddenly exploded in a hotel in Istanbul. None of these were not espionage activities by the British Telegraph Bureau. According to a report by the Swedish newspaper Folkets Dagblad last autumn, the London Intelligence Bureau headquarters is divided into foreign, colonial, and domestic departments according to political divisions, and into army relations (managed by Colonel Waldgrave Cairn), naval relations (managed by Admiral Goodfield), air force relations (managed by Major Baron Waral), news relations (managed by Sir Cocril), painting and photography relations (managed by Lawson Bram), code relations (managed by Sir Irvine), etc. according to functions. In addition, there are consular departments and offensive departments. The offensive department even recruits legal or financial experts as cadres to engage in active international espionage activities. Such as assassination, incitement, and sabotage, all of which are carried out under the secret orders of this department. Inside the headquarters, there is also a powerful agency like the General Staff. In addition, there are three specially established teams directly under the Prime Minister's Office, which are local activity agencies of the Intelligence Bureau.</p>
<p>First, regarding strategy and diplomacy, it is responsible for the collection of political and economic intelligence, riots, incitement, sabotage, etc. Second, regarding tactics, that is, the military attachés belonging to the army and navy foreign embassies. Third, the so-called spies. With such a large organization, its funds are of course very large. In 1939, the expenses of the Intelligence Bureau headquarters, only used in army and navy intelligence relations, reached 2.3 million pounds. The subsequent expenses will naturally continue to increase.</p>
<p>Unscrupulous Espionage</p>
<p>During the last war and after the war, Montagu Norman, the governor of the Bank of England, and American magnate Morgan, jointly bought newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals, as well as politicians in neutral countries, etc., to collect secret information and squandered a lot of money. In 1914, the famous Irish Liberal Party fighter Sir Roger Casement was assassinated by British spies in Norway on his way from the United States to Germany. During the last war, Romanian King Carol was assassinated for insisting on neutrality, which resulted in Romania joining the Allied forces. These are all well-known facts. Mohamed Hachoutraci's work as a British spy is also a famous fact.</p>
<p>The facts of British espionage activities in the previous war are too numerous to mention. Following this example, then in this war, in the ingenious and vicious espionage activities of the British Intelligence Bureau, the results achieved are how many and how great, it is not difficult to imagine. The British spy's slogan is "The World is the Enemy," and in the world's political, economic, social, or war methods themselves becoming increasingly complex, the activities of spies are also becoming increasingly complex, subtle, difficult, and important. In the occupied territories, conspiracies, anti-Axis incitement and instigation, assassinations, sending Morse code signals by flashing lights on rooftops and in chimneys to guide the flight of night-time aircraft, engaging in extremely sinister anti-Axis propaganda through secret short-wave transmitters, etc., the more unfavorable the situation, the more profound the way British spies act. Moreover, the magic hands of the British Intelligence Bureau are by no means limited to Europe, which must also be understood. (Translation from the Yomiuri Hochi, April 12)</p>

<h3 id="e41">Implementing Warehouse Inspections: Strictly Managing Commercial Warehouse Operations - Warehouses Must Cautiously Accept Consignments <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>In order to crack down on hoarding and suppress price increases, the authorities, based on the loan account books of various banks, thoroughly investigated hoarders. The Chenghua Company, which operated hoarding without registration, and the Jutong Bank, which was suspected of major involvement, were investigated rigorously. In order to take effective measures, in addition to ordering warehouses belonging to various banks and storage facilities set up by companies, firms, and individuals to report stored goods, the inventory of various warehouses and storage facilities was also inspected for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Strict Management of Commercial Warehouses</p>
<p>The "Commercial Warehouse Control Regulations" stipulate that anyone operating a warehouse, whether it is a firm or a company, must submit an application to the local competent authority for approval and registration before starting business. Warehouses that have already been opened must apply for registration before they can continue to operate. The application for registration should include (1) warehouse name, (2) warehouse location, (3) whether the warehouse is self-built or leased, (4) the names, ages, native places, and addresses of the warehouse operator and manager, (5) whether it is specialized or part-time, (6) warehouse capacity and equipment, and (7) the date of opening.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Accepting Consigned Goods</p>
<p>Any warehouse operator shall not accept consignments from any individual or store without commercial registration. If the consignment is a major commodity stipulated in Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations for Stabilizing Prices, it shall not be accepted without the certification of the industry association. The warehouse receipts issued by each warehouse should state (1) the store name and business location of the consignor, (2) the number of the commercial registration certificate, (3) the industry association to which it belongs, and (4) the price of the consignment.</p>
<p>Reporting the Storage of Goods Within a Time Limit</p>
<p>For the consigned goods, each warehouse shall, at the end of each month, list the details of the consignments and consignors by category and household and submit them to the local competent authority for inspection. It is heard that the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau, the Public Concession Work Bureau, and the French Concession Public Board have all ordered the warehouses and storage facilities to report before April 30. They should follow the laws and regulations and send personnel to inspect the commercial warehouses or other storage places in their jurisdiction at any time. Any warehouse or storage facility that violates the laws and regulations will be dealt with according to law.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Fire at Guizhou Road: Trial Begins Yesterday; Chen Jinshan Admits to Arson Out of Hatred for His Uncle <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the fire at the Chen Taichang Car Rental Company at 124 Guizhou Road on the 9th of this month, which resulted in multiple fatalities, the Lao Zha Police Station has placed great importance on this matter. Initially, the owner of the car rental company, Chen Haiyuan, was suspected of arson. However, upon investigation, the value of the goods Chen had stored was over 500,000 yuan in national currency. The fire insurance he held with the Sin Sin, China United, and Ning Shao companies totaled only 20,000 old French francs. Given these circumstances, it was determined that he had no motive for arson to claim insurance money. Subsequently, a worker at the car rental company, Yao Yinquan, stated that at the time of the fire, he had gotten up to urinate and saw Chen Jinshan, the owner's nephew, carrying bedding and leaving in haste. At that moment, a fire broke out under the stairs, and the flames rapidly severed the handrail. Investigators suspected Chen Jinshan and detained him for strict questioning at the police station. Chen Jinshan confessed that he was 37 years old and the nephew of Chen Haiyuan. He worked as a painter at Chen Taichang. In January of this year, he was severely reprimanded for stealing 100 yuan that his uncle was supposed to remit to the Public Works Bureau as a business tax. Then, on April 6th, a gallon of turpentine was stolen from the shop, and he was again accused of the theft, with threats of reporting him to the authorities. Resentful of his uncle's ruthlessness, he harbored a grudge. On the night of the 8th, after going to bed at 10 p.m., he suddenly thought of revenge. Around 1 a.m., he got up and poured half a gallon of turpentine on the bamboo strips under the stairs, then set it ablaze. He then took the opportunity to flee, first spending the night at his aunt's place at the New Big Meat Shop in Tangjia Nong, and the next morning went to his brother's noodle shop, Ding Tai, on Pudong Dong Road, before returning home, where he was arrested. Yesterday morning, the case was brought before the Special Number One Court for questioning. The police charged Chen Jinshan with arson and murder, requesting that he be severely punished according to the law. When questioned, Chen Jinshan's account of the facts matched the police's findings. The court, noting that the autopsy report was still needed, ordered Chen Jinshan to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>

Their internal structure and operations will soon undergo a complete transformation to facilitate the smooth control of national resources under the wartime system. The ten trade associations that have already had initiators designated—cotton, yarn, knitwear, cloth, coal, coal briquettes, new medicines, industrial oils, tobacco-matches-soap-candle, and tobacco leaf sales—are actively planning adjustments to complete their organizations by or before the 25th of this month. Businesses that have not joined these trade associations will be prohibited from operating from May 1st. In addition to actively adjusting their organizations and formally establishing themselves by the deadline, the trade associations are re-registering existing members to promote the welfare of their members. At the same time, to strengthen their ranks, they are soliciting non-member businesses to join within the specified period to avoid suspension. Businesses applying for membership must obtain a membership application and registration form from the association.</p>
<p>Cotton Products Industry in Three Provinces Urged to Join Federation</p>
<p>The Joint Federation of Cotton Products Industries in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has been established as ordered. All cotton product industries (including yarn factories, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, dyeing, knitting, native cloth, underwear, bedsheets-towels, handkerchiefs, and other related cotton product industries) in all counties and cities in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, in addition to those that have already joined, should complete the membership procedures in accordance with the regulations. Those who have not yet joined should immediately prepare the following documents in accordance with the regulations: (1) Membership letter of intent; (2) Certificate of organization approved by the competent authority, or notarized proof of registration; (3) Curriculum vitae of directors and supervisors; (4) List of members; (5) Articles of association; (6) Member asset survey form (capital amount and number of machines for production members); (7) Member business status survey form (historical production volume or sales volume), two copies each, and invite two members as introducers to apply for membership.

<p>Cotton Businesses Must Register by the 21st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Trade Association has been approved by the Shanghai Economic Bureau to adjust its existing structure in accordance with the wartime economic policy guidelines, and Wu Renqing, Chen Qingzheng, Zhang Qiliang, Feng Junsheng, You Boqin, Li Ruifu, He Changqi, and others have been designated as initiators of the trade association. The initiators have already convened the first meeting and decided to adjust the association to strengthen its structure in accordance with the wartime system. It was also resolved to conduct a re-registration of members. All cotton businesses in the city must apply for membership, regardless of whether they were members before. They must re-register, fill out a membership application, and the person in charge must provide a letter of authorization from the business. However, old members do not need this procedure and only need to re-register. The deadline is three days, ending on the 21st. All cotton shops must join the association. This concerns their own business rights, and they should not hesitate. Late registrations will not be accepted.</p>

The original female police uniforms will be collected by each branch and must not be left outside to prevent abuses.</p>
<h3 id="e52">200 Pickpockets Arrested in One Week <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Police Department launched a second anti-pickpocketing campaign, and 200 pickpockets have been arrested in one week. The large number of arrests demonstrates the success of the police's surveillance network. The police will now offer rewards to those who report pickpocketing activities.</p>
<p>Female Thieves Used to Practice Tricks</p>
<p>The police have also discovered interesting facts during the arrest of pickpockets. According to the confession of a juvenile thief, the theft gang he belonged to was led by two major thieves. The gang was divided into two factions and operated in entertainment venues. They would first have a young female thief lure the target to an inconspicuous place and engage them in interesting conversation. Then, the gang would send someone to steal the target's wallet. This gang earned an average of 500 yuan per day. Another entire gang that was arrested specialized in robbing passengers at the wharves. As for the other arrested individuals, most did not belong to a fixed gang and committed thefts on public transportation.</p>
<p>Six Repeat Offenders Arrested Six Times Recently</p>
<p>At 6 p.m. on the 9th of this month, the Police Department learned that a large number of pickpockets were hiding in the shacks in the area of Seymour Road, Macau Road, and Xiaoshadu Road. They immediately went to the address and arrested six unemployed suspects: He Yongkang, nicknamed Xiaoshandong, 28 years old, from Xuzhou; Zhou Songlin, nicknamed Xiaokouzi, 16 years old, from Jiangbei; Liu Jiujinzi, 12 years old, from Jiangbei; Liu Songming, also known as Huamian, 16 years old, from Jiangbei; Yang Wengan, nicknamed Xiaolaizi, 12 years old, from Taizhou; and Yang Xiushan, 26 years old, from Jiangbei. Upon arrest, it was discovered that they had committed multiple pickpocketing cases in the concession. They were sent to the Special District Court for interrogation. During the investigation, they confessed that they had two accomplices at large, Yang Sanhouzi and Xiaosanzi, who jointly organized a pickpocketing gang, divided into two teams. The first team was led by He Yongkang, and the second team was led by Liu Songming. They stole valuables in the concession and shared the proceeds. At the time of their arrest, 285 yuan in cash was seized.</p>
<h3 id="e53">National General Chamber of Commerce for Commodity Control: Six Service Creeds; Director-General Convenes Staff Meeting <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The National General Chamber of Commerce for Commodity Control has been established for one month. The internal organization, except for the professional departments that will be established separately based on industry after the establishment of various industry federations, has been largely completed for the various sections and groups of the administration department. The Commodity Movement Permit Office in Hamilton Mansion, originally entrusted to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry to receive and handle on its behalf, has also been taken over by the Chamber's staff since the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at 8:30, Tang Shoumin, the Director-General of the Chamber, held a meeting at the Chamber to address all staff members. The main points of his address were as follows: "Our Chamber was established on March 15th, and the administrative departments and personnel have been arranged and are performing their respective duties. What I want to say to everyone today is that to accomplish anything, one must be impartial, selfless, and strive to be responsible. All colleagues in the Chamber have been rigorously selected and employed, and I believe that they can all put the above two points into practice without further ado. However, the Chamber is just starting, and it is a pioneering effort, and few people have experience. Therefore, I must hope that everyone will work diligently and conscientiously so as not to fail the expectations of the country and the people. To ensure that everyone has a standard to follow, I would like to present the following items that I want to say from my heart as the creeds for myself and everyone to serve this Chamber. I sincerely hope that colleagues will supervise and encourage each other and work together in a spirit of division of labor to help me shoulder the arduous mission of this unprecedented undertaking." The six creeds are listed below: (1) Impartiality and integrity are the main tenets of this Chamber; (2) Recognize that this Chamber is a purely commercial, collective, and autonomous organization, and there should be no bureaucratic habits; (3) Working together in the same Chamber requires a spirit of mutual supervision and joint responsibility; (4) Handling affairs must be quick and accurate, and courtesy and politeness should be shown to outsiders; (5) Do not accept any solicitations that violate the controlling spirit of this Chamber and affect the reputation of the entire body; (6) All matters of this Chamber must not be disclosed before they are officially announced. It is hoped that all colleagues will strictly adhere to these six rules and pay attention to them at all times. Any violation will result in dismissal or legal sanctions. I hope that all colleagues will be public-spirited, law-abiding, and supervise and encourage each other. This will be fortunate for the Chamber and fortunate for the colleagues."</p>
<h3 id="e54">Reader's Forum: The Necessity of Increasing Police Salaries <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yiming</p>
<p>All citizens hope for local peace and tranquility so that they can live and work in peace. Shanghai is a major commercial port where Chinese and foreigners live together. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, police administration has improved, and theft cases have decreased significantly, for which we sincerely pray.</p>
<p>Defending the territory requires the army; maintaining local order relies on the police. The police are indispensable protectors of our citizens every day, so we should provide them with sufficient salaries to maintain their livelihoods, to reassure them, and to encourage their spirit of service.</p>
<p>However, according to my recent investigation, the monthly salary of a patrolman in the concession is 285 yuan, while the police in Western Shanghai and the city receive less than 100 yuan per month. It is really difficult to live in Shanghai on these salaries. If we calculate based on the cost of living index, these meager salaries can only support one person for ten days! Everyone knows that the police have heavy responsibilities, so we must ensure that they can not only maintain their own livelihoods but also support their wives and three children. Now, society only knows that the police take advantage of their positions and behave improperly, but they do not know that their salaries are indeed meager. I say this not to defend the police who cannot maintain their integrity, but to thoroughly eliminate their corrupt behavior and to address what our citizens should pay attention to.</p>
<p>I run a factory on Jessfield Road. In a small house next to the factory lives a police officer with a junior high school education. He is very loyal. Last month, he came to the factory and asked me to take in his son as an apprentice. He said that his monthly police salary was only 93 yuan, and he had to pay for his own meals. He has parents, his wife, and two children to support. His monthly expenses are at least 500 yuan. Fortunately, his wife sells vegetables and can earn more than 400 yuan to supplement the family income. Now that prices are soaring, he cannot expect his son to graduate from elementary school and is eager to have him work in the factory, as long as he gets food, regardless of any stipend.</p>
<p>Hearing this, I realized that police salaries are so meager. I never imagined that those who protect us citizens every day are treated worse than the apprentices in our factory. Because the apprentices' meals are provided by the factory, and they receive a stipend of 50 to 60 yuan per month and annual bonuses.</p>
<p>Writing this, I dare to publicly appeal to the government authorities and the citizens. It is absolutely necessary to greatly increase police salaries. To stabilize the lives of the police is to ensure social security, and I hope everyone will pay attention to this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e55">City Health Authorities Actively Launch Epidemic Prevention Campaign; Implementing Inspection of Epidemic Prevention Certificates Next Month <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Starting today (the 20th), widespread epidemic prevention vaccination campaigns have been launched in all districts of the city. In addition to establishing health sub-offices at designated locations to vaccinate residents, the health authorities are encouraging hospitals and Baojia chiefs to automatically set up free vaccination points to prevent some residents from being left out. In the next month, the authorities will not enforce the inspection of epidemic prevention certificates, but will inspect them on various roads after late May, requiring every resident to have a citizen's certificate. In addition to epidemic prevention vaccination, the health authorities are also actively launching epidemic prevention matters. It is said that public and private epidemic hospitals have been planning to open in the near future, and precautionary measures have been taken for isolating plague patients and rescue methods. The epidemic prevention publicity campaign will likely be held at the beginning of next month. In addition to health workers, school students, Baojia youth group members, and hospital doctors and nurses will be invited to participate. The publicity program will not only encourage the public to get vaccinated but also make them understand various epidemic prevention methods, with particular emphasis on fly eradication.</p>
<p>French Concession Actively Promoting</p>
<p>The epidemic prevention work in the French Concession has been actively carried out since the 12th of this month, with more than 60 doctors and personnel providing vaccinations in various districts within the concession every day, assisted by Baojia personnel. It is estimated that 15,000 people are vaccinated each month. Doctors have also been sent to various schools and groups to provide vaccinations. According to accurate statistics, more than 75,000 residents within the concession have been vaccinated. Starting from the 3rd of next month, additional personnel will be deployed to expand the work, increasing the current number by more than half, with more than 100 people going to various districts to carry out epidemic prevention work and vaccinate residents, with the goal of completing the vaccination in May to maintain public health in the summer.</p>
<p>City Health Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Health Bureau held a bureau meeting in its auditorium yesterday morning at 11 a.m. to discuss various measures for launching the epidemic prevention campaign, with particular emphasis on the promotion of hygiene and cleanliness in Nanshi.</p>
<p>Western Shanghai Vaccination of Shantytowns</p>
<p>Since the Western Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Corps established 11 epidemic prevention vaccination teams on the 16th of this month, they immediately set off to carry out vaccination in the shantytowns in the Western Shanghai district for three days. The mission was originally scheduled to be completed on the 18th, but due to insufficient time, they continued to carry out vaccinations in the Xujiahui, Hujiazhai, and Lu Xuezhai Xinchang factories in the Western Shanghai district from the 19th. Starting today, they will continue to carry out comprehensive vaccinations at various entrances and exits in the Western Shanghai district as usual.</p>
<p>Hongkou Vaccination Statistics</p>
<p>In the Hongkou area, the number of people vaccinated in the past three days is: District 1, 14,773; District 2, 18,256; District 3, 30,112; District 4, 11,300; District 5, 19,500; District 6, 14,300; District 7, 57,843, for a total of 166,084 people. Vaccination work will continue until the deadline. Residents who have not been vaccinated are urged to get vaccinated as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In the 1942-1943 West Union Football League, there were no battles on the western front this week. In the future, Jiaozhou Park may be open to the public. The West Union Standing Committee must find another stadium to complete the season smoothly. In Group A, if the scores are equal, there will be a replay of the finals. (In the past, if the champion had equal points, the ranking was determined by the number of goals scored.) This will be decided by the committee. Currently, the Friendship League leads with seven wins and four draws. Although the Italian Navy has 16 points, it is second to the Friendship League. However, it has played one less game. In terms of actual ratio, the two teams are tied. Donghua helped others last week by forfeiting to the Friendship League. The third place remains unchanged. The fourth place Jewish team has four wins, two draws, and four losses, with 10 points. The Portuguese Chamber of Commerce closely follows, followed by St. Francis. Although Socell has fought many battles and lost, they have always gone all out.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Commentary: Mergers and Additions <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>It is strange that Japan's wartime economic system is now in inverse proportion to China's wartime economic system.</p>
<p>Take the merger and addition of banks, for example!</p>
<p>The number of ordinary commercial banks in Japan has decreased from 376 in Showa 12 (1937) to 149 in Showa 17 (1942) since the outbreak of the war. The number of savings banks has also decreased from 72 in Showa 12 to 69 in Showa 17. In January of this year, two major banks (Mitsui and Dai-Ichi) merged to form the Imperial Bank. This is the outline of mergers in the Japanese banking sector to adapt to the wartime economic system.</p>
<p>What about the banking sector in China? In recent years, not only has it not been able to merge and reduce like its eastern neighbor, but it has sprung up like mushrooms after rain. The authorities managing financial institutions seem to have adopted an attitude that the more, the better, and they are freely adding to the number of institutions. Taking Shanghai as an example, in recent years, 91 newly established banks, trust companies, money shops, and others have been approved and registered, and there are 74 more under review, making the financial institutions in Shanghai as numerous as carp crossing the river. Some have joked that they are "bank stalls."</p>
<p>It would be fine if bank stalls did not hinder people's livelihoods! However, it is said that the main business of newly established small banks and money shops is speculation and hoarding to make huge profits, disregarding the livelihoods of ordinary people. The distance between them and the wartime economic system is probably tens of millions of miles!</p>
<p>Let bygones be bygones, and the future can be pursued. I hope that both the government and the public will quickly clean up this deformed "small bank and money shop stall," otherwise, the entire Shanghai will collapse!</p>

<p>In addition to rice, the food materials managed by the Ministry of Food include flour, miscellaneous grains, livestock products, sugar, oils, tea, vegetables, fruits, seasonings, canned foods, aquatic products, brewing, and others, totaling 13 departments. Among them, flour and six other industries are related to people's livelihoods and should be controlled. The Ministry has ordered them to be listed as important food materials and has instructed the Ministry's staff stationed in Shanghai to promptly promote their reorganization. All preparation directors, deputy directors, and preparation staff of the major food materials federations and associations have also been assigned. The internal personnel issues of each association have been handled and resolved by the Shanghai office's staff at all levels. It is only waiting for the Ministry of Food to approve the organization rules of each association before convening an establishment meeting and electing officers. As for the future business policies of each industry and how to cooperate with relevant commercial groups in friendly countries, they are currently under discussion. As soon as each association is established, it will begin operations. The Ministry's Shanghai office held a discussion meeting at 4 p.m. on the 19th, attended by all Shanghai staff and the preparation directors, deputy directors, and preparation staff of the six major material industries, totaling more than 20 people. The meeting adjourned at 6 p.m. It is expected that the industry associations in the Shanghai area and the federations in various regions for these six industries will be organized by the end of this month at the latest.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Gu Bao newspaper reported that "The Chinese Stock Review Committee has been established by the City Economic Bureau in conjunction with Chinese stock merchants, and all payments for Chinese stock transactions are transferred to banks," according to a Central News Agency reporter. Yesterday, a special inquiry was made to the City Economic Bureau to ascertain the truth. According to the person in charge of the bureau, although the establishment of the Chinese Stock Review Committee and the transfer of payments to banks are stipulated in the Provisional Regulations issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to ban the buying and selling of Chinese company stocks by Shanghai stock merchants, the implementation has been temporarily suspended by order of the municipal government and with the approval of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. These two regulations will be formally announced by the government when it is necessary to implement them. The reported details are completely false and are obviously rumors fabricated by illegal merchants in an attempt to confuse the public. It is hoped that all sectors will not be deceived.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th – The Hong Kong Governor's Office, in order to crack down on exchange remittances to specific regions, promulgated a Governor's Order and Notice on the 19th, stipulating detailed procedures. The authorities also issued a statement explaining the policy of the crackdown, which stated: "It is hereby stipulated that the Empire of Japan (including the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Seas Islands), the Republic of China, the Empire of Manchuria, Thailand, and French Vietnam are designated as specific regions. Anyone wishing to transport or transfer goods to the above-mentioned regions must, within 20 days after the fact, process the yen exchange for the full value of the goods at the designated Hong Kong branches of Yokohama Specie Bank and Bank of Taiwan. However, regarding (1) goods worth less than one hundred yuan, (2) hand luggage or moving luggage, (3) fresh and salted fish, goose meat, vegetables, and fruits, (4) if all or part of the value of the goods is not to be processed for exchange, an application must be submitted to the Governor for approval. (If it is difficult to process the exchange, an application must be submitted for exemption.) It is hoped that exporters will cooperate more to ensure the smooth operation of these regulations."</p>
<h3 id="e66">Views of People Involved in the Business Consolidation Association <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Soap</p>
<p>Mr. Mitsuda Kazuo, the preparatory director of the soap department, is the person in charge of the soap section of the Mitsubishi Trading Company's miscellaneous goods department. He has been involved with soap in Manchuria and Shanghai for about ten years and is an authority on the soap industry. His views are as follows:</p>
<p>Soap is a daily necessity. In terms of its price, type, and timing, it seems to have become a serious problem today. This is primarily due to anxiety about the shortage of raw materials. Although the structure of the general association's lower-level organizations has been changed, it cannot proceed smoothly unless raw materials are also controlled at the same time. The consumption of soap in Central China is about 0000 boxes. Japanese companies account for 80% of the production capacity, while Chinese companies account for 20%, which can be considered quite sufficient. The biggest problem is raw materials. Before the war, tallow was imported from Australia, and coconut oil and coconut kernels were imported from Southeast Asia. Since imports have been cut off, raw materials are naturally quite scarce now. Although Central China also has tallow and crude oil, the attempt to increase tallow production cannot be done quickly because the increase in cattle production is not something that can be done immediately. Moreover, tallow is also used as edible oil, so it seems impossible to use it in large quantities as a soap raw material. Therefore, it is not considered essential in wartime economic policies. Similarly, importing coconut kernels and coconut oil from Southeast Asia through risky means is not being considered for the same reason. As for crude oil, which is extracted from the seeds of crude oil trees, it can be used as a soap raw material because it cannot be used as food. The seeds of crude oil trees are collected from wild crude oil trees in the mountains, and no artificial cultivation is required, so there is no hope of increasing production. The raw materials originally produced in Central China are only enough to supply half of the necessary amount, so the production volume of soap is also only half, and there is no hope of producing more. The only way is to find ways to reduce consumption. Whether soap made from raw materials that can be procured locally can be distributed to various places is a problem. Here, I would like to especially remind everyone that the oils and fats in soap raw materials are edible oils. If a lot of soap is consumed, it is equivalent to consuming a large amount of edible oil. However, the amount of soap consumed by Japanese people in Shanghai is three to five times that of the home country, which is probably mostly due to the environment. As for the problem of hoarding, the soap currently existing in the concessions is enough for one year's use, and most of it is hoarded by Chinese people. Because soap does not spoil within half a year to a year and does not take up much space, it is easy to hoard, thus becoming an object of speculation. The current soap countermeasures include raw material subsidies, eliminating hoarding, and reducing consumption. The purchasing agency for raw materials should be centrally purchased, maintaining close contact with manufacturing agencies and consumption agencies, and saving consumption, making distribution smooth, so that all places can benefit equally. As for the organizational structure, I think that a joint Sino-Japanese organization would be best, but there is an atmosphere of opposition from the Chinese side, because they are afraid of being monopolized by the Japanese side. It is still necessary to explain to them so that they can understand. (Continental News, April 17)</p>

<h3 id="e67">Misunderstanding "Doing a Favor" <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Zhong</p>
<p>When I see someone in trouble, whether they are relatives, friends, or even a "brother" from anywhere in the world whom I don't know, I always do my best to help them with money or labor. Even using a few "words of advice" to encourage a friend and promote their progress and success is an example of "helping." Mutual assistance is originally a duty that humans should fulfill; asking for help is, of course, a just and honorable right!</p>
<p>In fact, many people misunderstand the true meaning of "doing a favor." For example, a student asks the person sitting next to them for help during an exam, and the person next to them allows them to copy out of "courtesy." Or, a pedestrian is found to have contraband by the police and may whisper, "We are all family, let's talk it over... Please be accommodating and do me a favor..." and secretly hands over banknotes to settle the matter. Examples like these are endless. In short, both parties misunderstand "doing a favor."</p>
<p>Most of the corrupt and dark things in society arise from improper favors. The reason why certain figures can speculate and defraud and still get away with it is also because someone is "helping" behind the scenes, isn't it?</p>
<p>Remember that our "helping" and "being helped" should be just, honorable, and have a sense of justice!</p>
<h3 id="e68">"Facts" and "Imagination" <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Hui</p>
<p>"Facts" are the living, real things that exist now. For example, the current "rice is like pearls, firewood is like cassia," as well as "rationing by head" for rice and sugar, are all facts. "Imagination" is the formation of a special, false conscious representation based on past memories and experiences. This kind of representation does not necessarily match the "facts." For example, someone who is used to eating bitter things wants to eat some sugar, or a beggar "racks their brains" to imagine becoming an official, riding in a car, and taking a concubine is also a kind of "imagination."</p>
<p>Some people, because the "facts" are too bitter, too poor, and they have nothing to eat, are frowning all day long, clamoring that they cannot survive, wanting to turn things around, wanting to live better, "imagining" their stomachs full, walking without stumbling, "imagining" their clothes no longer tattered, to avoid being looked down upon, but "facts" are still "facts." Now they are still hungry, cold, and being looked down upon. "Imagination" must wait for the "future" to be realized. The concern is that when that time comes, the current "imagination" will still be the "imagination" of that time.</p>
<p>"Imagination" is something that everyone must have, has to have. It is the expression of "desire." The most beautiful and unrealistic castles in the air that are "imagined" easily become "utopias" and "fantasies," and the result will inevitably "run counter" to reality, leading to the most painful and unimaginable "facts."</p>
<p>The rich are good at "imagining," imagining more money and women. The poor are even better at "imagining," seeking happiness and sweetness in "imagination," and trying to "reduce" and "eliminate" the pain of reality in a "sudden enlightenment" manner. As one novel puts it: "... He, Shi Lunka, often dreamed of bread. Once, he dreamed of countless loaves of bread piled up in his thatched hut, the entire courtyard covered with pastries... He ate delicious pastries all night long. In the morning, his wife said gruffly that they would never eat rye bread again. Oh, it's better not to wake up at all, it's better to sleep, it's better to sleep, he thought." This is similar to a certain story: "There was a person who worked hard all day long but still didn't get any benefits. He said, it doesn't matter, I dream of being an emperor every night."</p>
<p>A country woman poured out her bitter half-life to the abbot and asked him for help. After listening, the abbot replied: "Endure it, heaven makes you suffer in life, and you will surely be blessed after death." Impractical "imagination" is only like being "blessed" after death – the "imagination" becomes "fact" in the grave. Isn't the beggar's unreasonable delusion of becoming an official, riding in a car, and taking a concubine like this?</p>
<p>However, "imagination" that is grounded and has a realistic basis, as long as it is coupled with strong perseverance and an indomitable spirit, is not difficult to become a "fact," because his "imagination" also contains the elements of "fact."</p>
<p>Therefore, floating and false "imagination" will deceive you into running into detours and dead ends. See clearly, grasp the objective "facts" of "imagination," and add subjective efforts, and you can create a brand-new life!</p>
<h3 id="e69">Viewing Bai Jiao's Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Hanruo</p>
<p>The Bai Jiao and his disciples' painting and calligraphy exhibition opened on the 19th at the Da Xin Gallery and will last for a week. On the morning of the opening day, the author took the time to visit, and it was already very crowded with visitors, showing that there are many people who admire the art of Yun Jian.</p>
<p>The exhibition features a total of about 300 pieces, with paintings accounting for one-third and calligraphy being the main exhibits. Bai Jiao has always been deeply engaged in calligraphy, and his writings on calligraphy are already familiar to us. Among the exhibits, couplets are the most numerous, while screen strips and vertical scrolls are fewer. Older works are more numerous than newer works, but they are all masterpieces. The vertical scroll of Zhuge Wuhou's Admonition to His Son combines intention and brushwork, both of which are excellent. Most of the couplets are collections of sentences, mostly works that admonish the world and please the mood and temperament.</p>
<p>Among the paintings, there are mostly orchids, bamboos, and rocks. Several ink orchid paintings have a transcendent and unconstrained layout, seemingly written by the author in the silence of all sounds, and are truly masterpieces. The orchid and ruyi painting in collaboration with Tang Dalang is also a masterpiece that should not be missed. Jin Xueyi, a disciple, presents new brushwork in the red plums, flowers, branches, and stems, which are beautiful, simple, fresh, and delightful.</p>
<p>There are only a dozen fan leaves on display, with many fine works. The page of Returning Home is especially lovely, and there are also many fine works in the album leaves.</p>
<p>The prices of the works are not high. Ink orchids, bamboos, and rocks, and a regular script album leaf, are jointly mounted into a vertical scroll, with a price tag of only 200 yuan, which is probably an old work. Otherwise, based on the current high cost of mounting, the cost would be more than 100 yuan, leaving little profit.</p>
<h3 id="e70">A Beautiful Personality <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Hui Ren</p>
<p>A lofty position and vast wealth are by no means the most worthy objects for young people to strive for. A beautiful personality is the most worthy of respect.</p>
<p>People who value utilitarianism too much often use the grand banner of career to gloss over their tricks and deceptions, declaring that tricks are necessary means for doing business and that deception is an appropriate expedient for doing business, sparing no effort to destroy their pure personality. They don't think that they can also do business without resorting to tricks and that they can also achieve success without using deception.</p>
<p>Moreover, if they must resort to tricks and use deception to achieve professional goals and win respected reputations, then they would rather give them up to preserve their own personality, because a foundation based on tricks and deception is very unstable, like a mirage in the clouds that will soon collapse and disappear. Wouldn't the defilement of this personality be in vain!</p>
<p>Building a career on a foundation of upright and honest character is solid and firm, like a thousand-year-old tree standing upright in a deep valley, which can last forever. Therefore, everyone must maintain their own upright and honest character, even at the cost of their lives.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can remember that "a beautiful personality is the greatest career in the world."</p>
<h3 id="e71">Ninth Place in the February Essay Contest: How to Read Books? What Books to Read? <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhiping</p>
<p>There have always been scholars who "buried their heads in hard study under the window for ten years," but the result is "the more they read, the more foolish they become" and "the more they read, the more confused they become." There are also "excellent individuals" who claim to have superior qualifications, pretending to have "read extensively," but once examined, they reveal their fox tails, knowing nothing about anything. This clearly tells us that if we don't know how to read and what to read, even if we spend all our efforts, it will be in vain. How to read books?</p>
<p>(A) Techniques (1) Balanced Activity of Various Organs — Ancient people only emphasized memory when reading books. They memorized classics, histories, and collections, but they were indifferent to the content. What is the use of reading like that? Therefore, when we read books, we should use our brains, eyes, hands, and mouths at the same time. Use the brain for memory, association, and deduction; use the eyes to practice speed reading; use the hands to underline and take notes; use the mouth to recite important sentences. (2) Close Reading and Skimming — There are so many books that they can fill houses to the rafters. Unless one is a fool, one would use the same energy and time to read all books. Therefore, for the most basic and valuable books on a certain aspect or problem, we should read them carefully. As for less important books, we only need to "get a general idea." (3) Criticism and Doubt — It is not enough to just understand when reading books. We should go further and cultivate a spirit of criticism and doubt. (4) Research and Writing — It is easy to suffer from "indigestion" if one does not apply what one has read. Therefore, in addition to reading books, when we encounter problems that we do not understand or are interested in, we should collect relevant materials and conduct a systematic study. If we are interested, we might as well write the results of the research into an article. (5) Collective Learning — Reading books alone often has the disadvantages of being biased, ignoring difficulties, and lacking persistence. To avoid them, organizing or joining a reading group is a good remedy.</p>
<p>(B) Environment We certainly don't have to aspire to a "bright window and clean desk," but if we can pay a little attention, it will always be helpful.</p>
<p>(C) Time Generally, the brain is at its healthiest in the morning; using this time to read more difficult books (such as philosophy) is most effective. It is not advisable to overwork the brain after meals; we can read some literary works. It is best to leave lighter tasks such as taking notes to the evening.</p>
<p>What books to read?</p>
<p>There has always been much debate on this question. The "opening a book is beneficial" school claims that all books are worth reading; the old conservatives argue that only "the books of sages and worthies" that can teach us to "understand reason" should be read, and that all others should be discarded; and friends who read books to death believe that school textbooks are the whole world... Who is right? None of them! For us, knowledge is a weapon used to guide action and reform the world. Therefore, we should read living, useful books. Any book that violates this premise can be kicked aside!</p>
<p>Which ones should we read? (A) From General to Specific: (1) In the early stages of reading, we must accept all basic knowledge and understand the connections between them. It is absolutely impossible to be careless. If we don't do this, we will feel congenitally deficient in whatever we do in the future. (2) When learning each subject, we must proceed step by step. For example, when learning social sciences, we should first read some introductory books, courses, and outlines (of course, we must choose good ones) to understand the general outline.</p>
<p>(B) From Modern to Ancient Old knowledge is also useful in a certain sense. However, this must be after we have laid the foundation of modern knowledge and cultivated the habit of criticism.</p>
<p>(C) From Good to Bad There is no absolute standard for the quality of books. For example, the "bad books" that were banned in past dynasties are no less valuable than the officially designated "holy books" in our opinion. Moreover, the same book may be harmful to A but very useful to B. We only need to adhere to our correct position.</p>
<p>If we can dissolve what has been said above into a scientific reading plan, coupled with a Kant-like regularized life, a Gorky-like spirit of struggle, and a Lu Xun-like tenacity, then success can be expected.</p>
<p>Finally, I must remind you: integrate with practice!</p>

<h3 id="e73">Resurrected Poor Woman in the Southern City Describes Her Illness <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>I am living my life for the second time. I had died, but now I am resurrected. Are you surprised, sir? Can a dead person be resurrected? Now I will tell you the whole story:</p>
<p>My husband's name is Gao Weiren, and he is a silversmith in a jewelry store. Because prices are high, his income is not enough to cover expenses, so I often help with living expenses. Also, because I am physically weak, coupled with the sudden cold and heat this spring, I fell ill half a month ago. At that time, we didn't even have money to buy rice, let alone money to see a doctor, so we could only wait for the arrival of the god of death. I fainted once on the Cold Food Festival. At that time, I went to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road, but they refused to admit me. Therefore, I died at seven o'clock on the morning of April 10th. My husband sent me to the funeral home in the southern city because he still had to raise money for the coffin, so he was not by my side. At two o'clock in the afternoon, I suddenly woke up. Although I drank the melted snow in the funeral home, the dangerous period had not yet passed. Later, my husband came, and of course, he was very happy to see me resurrected. He immediately wanted to ask a doctor to diagnose and treat me, but because there was no suitable doctor and no money, Mr. Hu of Shen Bao introduced me to Hongren Hospital on Avenue Haig. They also refused to admit me, so I had to go back. However, they insisted on charging five yuan for registration. I thought it was unreasonable for them not to admit patients but to charge five yuan for registration. On the way home, I passed Xu Fu's traditional Chinese medicine store at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Wenmiao Road. There, I thought that traditional Chinese medicine might be able to treat me, so I asked them to introduce me. As a result, a Ningbo doctor named Shu Shuyun (clinic at No. 3 Anle Lane, Zhonghua Road) acted righteously and treated me. He said that it was a spring febrile disease. He prescribed a prescription and told me that it was not serious and that I would definitely be out of danger after two or three times. He also said not to refrain from taking medicine and seeing a doctor because of lack of money. I told him about the situation I encountered in the hospital the previous two times. He said it didn't matter, come to me in the future, and I won't charge you a penny. This is how I got the opportunity to take medicine. The next day, I felt much better and still asked Dr. Shu to diagnose and treat me. After doing this three times in a row, my condition improved. Now I can eat some porridge and can stand and sit. I think the dangerous period is over. Dr. Shu also told me that the dangerous situation had passed and that I only needed to rest well to enter a good state.</p>
<p>Sir, I have been given the right to live my life again. I have suffered all the hardships of the world. The first thing I need to do to be able to be resurrected this time is to thank Dr. Shu Shuyun, who acted righteously, and I am also grateful for the enthusiastic assistance from all sectors. Respectfully, Gao Ruan, a poor woman, residing at No. 19 Puyu Lane, Huangjia Que Road, Southern City.</p>
<p>Donations from All Sectors After Gao Ruan's resurrection, various sectors have donated funds. Yesterday, we received 200 yuan from Mrs. Song and 100 yuan from Chen Juquan (for maintaining the fetus), which has been collected on their behalf. Someone was sent to the hospital to hand it over to the person. At the same time, we received a letter from Mr. Lu Peihan, stating that Gao Ruan's medical treatment process was slightly different from what was reported. It is claimed that: "After returning home from the funeral home, Gao Ruan was still ill and was sent to various hospitals for treatment, but the hospitals were only interested in profit and refused her treatment. I was saddened when I heard this, but my ability was insufficient. I happened to talk to Miss Zhou Hanying about this matter, and Miss Zhou also wished to help, so I asked Mr. Zhuang Yaosheng to donate 100 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, and Mr. Zhuang asked Mrs. Pan to ask Mr. Xie Jiaqian, a director of Renji Hall, to send a letter to Pingmin Hospital, which was generously accepted by the hospital and provided free diagnosis and treatment."</p>
