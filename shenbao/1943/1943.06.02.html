<h3 id="c1">四論劃北急賬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>關於華北急賑，我們曾不憚煩言，一再迫切呼籲。我們期望之中心，在於「救災如救火」一點。無論官賑，義賑，辦賑機關之設立，放賑人員之遴選，施賑辦法之規訂，賑款賑物之募集，作種種建議以外，特別需要出以敏捷，迅赴事功，俾災區同胞早解倒懸之苦。</p>
<p>迭承讀者發揮人類最高尙之同情心，有錢出錢，有物出物，繼續不斷踴躍輸捐，半月以還，僅本報一處，代收捐款已達三十餘萬元。至於統辦急賑之機構，在南京方面已先成立。本市方面，亦經主管當局籌備就緒，「上海各界華北急賑會」，將於今日正式成立。此後旣有統籌辦理之急賑機關，自應發揮與運用集中力量，措理一切。我們仍盼該機構能以迅捷手腕，英果姿態，饜社會熱烈之期望。謹願再申所見，以供參考：</p>
<p>第一，對於此次急賑，無論領導者，工作者，捐輸者，均當以一爲拯救華北災區同胞而服務」爲唯一對象。同時，更當認淸「責任重大」，「時機迫切」，而加倍努力。在這種情緒之下，無論其爲官賑，或爲義賑，絕對應精誠合作，通力共籌。我們必須瞭解籌設機構，爲救災也；募款捐款，爲救災也；奔走接洽，爲救災也；振臂呼籲，亦爲救災也。服務之方式雖異，而其目的則一。賑災工作，但有義務，絕無權利；但求有利災民，絕不能存公私畛域。以責人之心責己，以信己之心信人。負責者，本其至誠，努力於其所事；未負責者，則嚴厲監督，鼓舞其精神，而責成其功效。負責者固有責，即未直接負責者，亦有責。一言以蔽之，「早解災民倒懸之苦」，才算我責已盡，我心能慰了。</p>
<p>第二，急賑宜急，施救於星星之火的辦法，技術，決不能適應於已成燎原之火勢。巨額賑款，一時不易立集，則應商由國家銀行墊借，將來以募得捐款償還，或發行債券，以抵不足。這裏，我們將重提五月二十日本報社評中，林康侯，張一鵬兩先生關於向中央儲備銀行借款，及發行賑災公債的建議。至於辦賑原則，在五月二十三日本報星期評論張一鵬先生的「從華北賑災說到辦賑的先決條件」一文，也値得參考。</p>
<p>第三，賑物的採辦與運輸，需要友邦駐華各當局的充分協助，我們盼望主管當局的折衝之外，更期待友邦當局能自發最高尙的同情之心。</p>
<p>友邦人士經濟專家栗本寅治先生，前日在大陸新報發表「澈底救濟華北災荒」一文，大陸新報的社論也以「隣邦人士的義務」爲題，（均見本日本報第四版）都表示同情之意。目前日本雖在貢獻一切力量於戰爭目的，無多餘力實際救濟中國災民，但也將有一分力盡一分量。我們對此同情表示，殊足感念。㢠憶中日兩國，過去對於災害互助之事例，如民國十二年九月一日，日本國內大地震，彼時中國北京政府於九月三日，即召集特別閣議，設立「日災協濟會」，撥款二十萬元助賑，旅日華僑另撥賑款十萬元，‘並弛米糧出口之禁；廣東方面設立「災救濟會」，以伍朝樞，廖仲愷爲正副會長；上海方面設立「國協濟日災義賑會」，助賑品十二萬元，並派新銘輪運米助賑；天津方面設立「救災同志會」；東北方面亦助賑品五十萬元，張雨亭自捐十萬元，其他如段祺瑞個人捐助十萬元，曹錕四萬元，徐世昌，曹汝霖等亦均有捐助，全國各地踴躍捐輸，熱烈情狀，歷歷猶在記憶之中。更憶當時中日邦交正生痕隙之際，而中國人民，仍能急人之急，熱烈救助，絕不以邦交關係，而减少其救助災苦之熱情，此種態度，是我們中華民族和平博愛之精神所在。民國二十年七月，我國大水成災，災情至爲嚴重，日皇亦曾撥日金十萬元，作我賑災善後中之有力資助。凡此救災恤鄰之摯誼，與胞與天下的最高尙之同情心。中日民族實同具此美德。况目前中日之間在同生共存的密切協力之際，我們華北同胞遭遇如此悽慘，雖不能强人所難，期望友邦作大量賑款賑物之援助，但在運輸賑物與賑物之特弛統制兩點，期望友邦駐華當局的充分給予便利，我們相信必能得到同情和援助。</p>
<p>最後，我們値得特別提出報告的，是潘三省先生的慷槪輸捐鉅款，潘先生昨晚送到捐款五萬元，作爲義買袁履登先生的雪茄五十盒，可是幷不把雪茄取爲已有，仍願零散再義賣，以所得悉充捐款。而潘先生意猶未足，更將鑽戒一只（重的五克拉），及翠玉供瓶一座，也用義賣方式，以售款充捐，經專家估計，最低價前者爲十六萬元，後者爲一萬元，囑由本報辦理義賣事務。我們對於潘先生出錢又出物的慷槪精神，表示非常敬謝之意。同時，盼望滬上有錢人士，羣起仿效，共襄義舉，雄厚賑款，使此次華北急賑工作，得因多方面的努力而圓滿成功，豈僅萬千生靈拯於袵蓆，更充分發揮我中華民族博愛精神與團結力量，不勝企予望之。</p>
<p>同時，承友邦人士吉田先生槪捐一千元，水島先生槪捐三百元，爲友邦人士倡率，表示最敬崇之謝意。</p>

<h3 id="c2">確立真正決戰體制　日本將開臨時議會　閣議昨通過企業整備要綱　臨時議會定下月中旬召集 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電日政府爲應付現階段下連續決戰之局面，以期舉國一致確立眞正之決戰體制起見，決於下月十五日召集第八十二屆臨時議會，刻正着手起草向議會提出之緊要法律案及預算案等。關於此冷飲臨時議會之中心課題即企業整備問題，前已以企劃院作中心與陸海軍大藏商工農林厚生等各關係當局積極擬訂方案，茲已於一日定例閣議中提出討論而作正式決定。是日下午四時即由情報局將增强戰功整備企業之要綱要旨，及鈴木企劃院總栽關於此事之談話發表。關於增强戰力及整備企劃之根本方針，即爲（一）對於尙未增强者將積極使其急速戰力化，（二）對於重要產業部門更加以高度之整備與强化二點。故經此次之企業整備後，日本以煤·鐵·輕金屬·飛機·船舶等五大重點產業作中心之直接增强戰力，當可迅速期其實現。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日政府於一日十時在首相官邸召開定例閣舉，出席東條首相及全體閣員，首由鈴木企劃院總裁詳細說明增强戰力整備企業基本要綱，經各閣員交換意見後予以通過。嗣由東條首相說明確立決戰態勢方針，由各閣員交換意見結果，決定今年秋季之府縣議員總選舉不予實行，以爲初步工作，並決定將有關各法案提交第八十二屆臨時議會後散會。又東條首相是日會在會議席上說明確立決戰態勢之實行，爲當前急務，並提議將一切直接與增强戰力無關之行事予以取消，當經全體閣員一致贊同通過。東條首相之提義大意謂。。蓋因今日時局極爲重大，在國內全國國民自應將一切之時間勞力舉國之總力集中於生產軍需物資，增產糧食，强化運輸，故應加倍强化國民勤勞動員態勢，以期將國民各階層所有之餘力，均無增强戰力而予以活用。是以凡與增强戰力無直接關係之公私行事，均應予以減少至本年秋季全國各府縣會議員均將實行選舉，但當此努力增產糧食之重大時期，國民將爲選舉而徒費其時間與勞力，似未見適當。故政府乃決定本年秋季之府縣會議員選舉等事不予舉行。</p>

<p>— 福田豐四郞</p>
<p>日本海大海戰時投降的敵將湟保加道夫少將，對於我國軍艦說：「今天因爲是戰鬭，所以穿着這種煤炭弄汚的衣服，眞失禮貌，請原諒！』</p>
<p>因爲戰鬭而就汚穢，這是一種利己的想法，但對於我國海軍的古代武士是穿準備下的上等淸潔服，而想最後裝飾一下的精神，兩兩相較眞有天壤之別，所以也可以在這一點上早已看出鹿死誰手。</p>
<p>我國海軍衣那决空前大勝的第二天，便像往日一樣，又開始了平素的戰鬭操練。這眞是本然的日常之道，達觀者的三昧之境。</p>
<p>傳統在生長着。鍛練者與被鍛練者，都認爲每日訓練即戰爭，所以大東亞戰爭爆發以來，取得無數輝煌戰果者，這只都是當然的代價</p>
<p>我想念到在橫越赤道圈的艦上時，聽到過很多我國海上的鬭魂。去年一月佔領南婆羅洲的油都拔里克帕班後，立刻敵國飛機晝夜不斷地襲擊我國運輸船與護衛艦艇。對於退避到季古雜克的運輪船，敵人盲目地施以轟炸，在船身的左右前後都被炸彈轟起雄壯的水柱，被機關槍掃射水面像雨點一橡。而我國口口艇　着敵彈皷着氣息憤然向空中開火，而把逃走的敵機恨恨不捨地追趕着。正如貓追老鼠一樣，口口艇追趕轟炸機的鬭志－英勇不可侮的浩然之氣－不禁使我聯想到馬萊近海我國海鷹追趕望影即逃的威爾斯親王號，於是會心一笑。</p>
<p>如念到毫不松懈而嚴密不斷。之本處放射綫上的一切海洋之我國海軍威容，真是不容我們有一瞬間的懈怠。</p>
<p>艦上兵士仍然爲兵士，軍艦依然是軍艦，只有軍艦旗才是國家的縮影。要看在這面旗上所集結着的鬭魂。作戰的砲手，掌司艦艇內部的機關士，不論前綫與後方，大家都有一條鐵的必勝心。戰鬭的整個日本，要像一艘戰艦一樣。（濤：譯自朝日新聞）</p>

<p>倫敦金融新聞五月二十七日載有「戰爭中之澳洲」一文，內稱，據康白拉財部透露，截至本屆財政，年度爲止，澳洲在目前戰事中所用去之軍費，將超過一·〇八四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊，其中四五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊係發行債券所募集，三五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊係得自捐稅，其餘則係貸諸銀行。</p>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電</p>
<p>澳洲因軍需工業之畸形發展，及民需物資之深感不足，致惡性通貨膨脹，更趨深刻，其影響作戰至深且鉅。據英國各報所載：澳洲於一九四二年至四三年度之歲出總額爲六億五千二百萬鎊，其中戰費則佔五億四千萬鎊，此較之一九四一年至四二年度之三億二千萬鎊，增加頗多。澳洲主要之財源爲租稅，雖自本年二月起實行增稅，但稅收總額，僅爲二億六千萬鎊，其餘之三億九千萬鎊，惟有以發行公債及吸收遊資籌補。益以物資不足，人民購買力增加，乃爲當然之現象，此實爲促進澳洲通貨膨脹原因之一。查自去年一月起至本年一月止，一年間澳洲聯邦銀行鈔票發行額爲一億二千六百十萬鎊，較之去年激增四千二百九十萬鎊，而其紙幣之膨脹，較之前年間流通額的增加二倍，此顯爲通貨膨脹之現像。澳洲政廳有鑒於此，已着手統制物價，但尙未實施物資配給制。澳洲戰時歲出爲六億七千二百萬鎊，其中二億六千二百萬鎊，係以租稅籌劃，二億六千萬鎊，則賴發行公債與銀行借款彌補，其餘之一億五千萬鎊，係用其他方法籌劃。至其戰時國民儲蓄額，在一九四二年僅有三千一百二十萬鎊，故澳當局於窮困之餘，又擬實行大量增稅。其增稅擬以提高高額收入及中等程度收入之所得稅稅率爲目的，但僅此恐仍難完成其所期之目的，而不得不提高低額所得之稅率。惟現在澳洲之稅率，爲英帝國自治領中之最高者，故已遭受各方面之激烈反對，是以澳政府似又不得不停止再度增稅。總之，當前澳洲處境極爲困難，其戰時財政可謂已至山窮水盡之地步。</p>

<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>（一）小竹文夫教授，於同文書院研究中國聞訊凡二十年，五月二十六日，接受學校當局的表彰，是日於招待新聞記者席上發表意義深長之談話，即近來一般人注意力所集中的中日問題核心之文章。茲轉載具全文於後：</p>
<p>「日本計會成立的根本爲忠義，而構成中國社會之紐帶者爲信義。扎子在論語中曾言及爭取民心之方法有三：信義爲上策，財力爲中策武力爲下策。英美以中策爭取中國而失敗。日本若以武力爭取中國民心，則可謂之下策。不幸中國對於日本的觀念，爲不信賴日本。中國開題的治本辦法，即在於恢復已失的信賴。我國既聲明撤銷治外法權與無條件文還敵產，則必須求其澈底實行。任何犧性在所不惜。此爲中日提携的最後一次機會。確立信義後，一切中日間的問題，可由此解決。」（二十七日大陸新報）</p>
<p>誠如小竹教授之言，大多數日本人皆知「以武力爭取中國民心，乃對華政策之最下策」；但今日大多數中國人民皆深信日本「擬以武力取得中國民心」。此即中日問題的焦點。假如今日大多數中國人，瞭解日本並無「以武力取得中國民心」的意向，則中日事變該早已解決了。反之，如日本祗若不能使中國人瞭解此點，縱徒日本「澈底實現」「治外法權之撤消與敵產之無條件交還」，則中日問題亦不能得到滿意解決。當然，所以毅然決然撤消治外法權與無條件交還敵產者，乃求糾正中國人民抱日本武力解決中國的誤解之一個手段，但這決不是「最後一次機會」。反之，如能使中國人瞭解日本並無「以武力然決中國」的野心，此乃對華政策的最後成功。</p>
<p>（二）日本「改變政策」後，最重要之課題，乃向中國人如何具體證明日本並不擬以武力攫取中國。正如中國人以及小竹敎授都承認「中國對於日本的觀念，爲不信賴日本」，而對日本人的一舉一動都完全存着一種戒懼心。當然假如單純空唱「中日親善」「同文同種」，「共存共榮」等高調，則愈使增加疑心。對中國人唯一的解釋方法，則必須開誠佈公檢討中日兩國的當前客觀形勢、藉以指出中日兩國相互提携的必然出路。</p>
<p>然則目前中日兩國當前的大東亞客觀形勢，究竟如何？暫且不談國際形勢。於大東亞地區內，日本幾乎業已掌握其整個經濟命脈與整個戰略險要。日本軍的任務，並不是在於擴大佔領區，而是在於如何確保已佔領者。問題之尤其重大者，乃開發大東亞地區之經儕，以培養絕對不敗於英美生產方之戰力。日本當局雖不懼英美之生產力，也決不輕視。爲對抗英美此種生產力所必需之東亞經濟開發，在日本最重要者爲人力。日本有技術，有材料，有組織力，唯少感不早者爲人力。但人力之或得；也決非不可的克服廠結，因全世界半數以上之人民居於亞洲。尤其世界人口之最衆多者，莫過於中國。總之，問題在於能否動員此龐大人力。中國人和日本人的知識水準大致相仿，如施以適當技術教育，則斯萬萬人民立刻能使用於現代產業之任何部門，但在不願協助日本這一點上，不僅生產方面爲然，而其他各方面都如此，僅有程度上之差異。然中國人祗要認爲日本「擬用武力征服中國人心」，則決不心願與日本協力的。職是之故，日本爲求中國人担負大東亞戰爭，則「以武力解決中國」之方法，必歸失敗。假如今日日本人中，「擬以武力取得中國人心」者仍然存在，則可認爲彼等擬阻撓日本進行反英美的戰爭。人類雖以行爲製造客觀事實，但客戰事實形成後，則其客觀事實即反而支配人類的行爲。大東亞戰爭，即獨立於各交戰國意志外的一種客觀存在，而已構成爲一種不可抗的巨力，片面的人類意志，已經無躋於事。在此大東亞戰爭過程中業已發展了的這一客觀情勢，已促成日本感覺需要中國人民心悅誠服的協力。但「以武力取得中國民心」這一方法，途成爲日本不能求得進行大東亞戰爭的必要條件了。於是，中國人對日本的向來畏懼，根據此種國際形勢，可以得出十足滿意的解消。假如根據此種國際形勢，相反而得出必能與英美携手，盡量阻機日本建設大東亞之結論，則此種人乃某種先入觀念作祟使然。</p>
<p>（三）一部份中國人所真有的先入觀念，乃由九一八，一二八，八一三等一連串的不幸事變，而奠定基礎。此稱觀念非常根深蒂固。如有少觸犯其觀念者，其怒髮沖冠之激烈程度，則住往搬出祖宗三輩來痛罵不止。因我在申報發表了一篇論文，遂　蒙讀者的叱責。有人說：「你不看中日關係的現實，而祗議理想的中日關係，在客觀上是護九一八以來的日本立場」。另有人說：「現在日本人不是以第三種親日派爲對象麼？你既　護現存的中日合作，那末你就是　護第二種親日派。現在對於這一單讀者恕我無一一置答的時間，但我祗有一個反問，即祗在亞爾薩斯和羅林二省的誰屬問題上兜圈子，那未德法間能有何種合理的和平解決方法麼？」如祇算舊賬而談過去事實，結果，其解決方法祇有訴諸武力之一途。假如站在這種立塲上來討論中日問題，那末結論將是：與其我們訴諸文章討論，倒莫如訴諸其他更適當的方法爲妙，於是兩大民族祗有非到同歸於盡的地步，則戰爭不止。假如不如此，而想得到某種合理的和平解決方法（如不願使中日兩國文化像Aztec人的文化一樣滅亡），則並不是從歷史的仇恨中尋找，而是從現狀Statuscuo所產生的必要中尋找。何況，如不單純研究九一八以來一直到今天的連須不幸事變本身的話，則必須在其發生的國際形勢下考察。多數日本人都相信近衛前首相所說的：「中日糾紛是舊世界體制重壓下發生的變態東亞內亂。解決，則祇有快刀闊斧地斬晰構於舊世界秩序根底上的矛盾，方能有望」。因此大東亞戰爭爆發後，推倒英美舊體制的重壓，而方造成今日解決中日糾紛的客觀形勢</p>
<p>發展力強大的國民，當碰到發展力受阻時，祗苦不能調整其發展力，則必然將起某種爆發。如否認這一爆發必然性者，則亦否認其同民之發展力。世界一面製造日本爆發的必然性，而一面非難這一爆發，這正如丈夫非難妻子「物價如此之高，你爲什麼要生小孩子？」一機沒有道理。假如中國具有和日本同樣的發展性，而中日反不起衝突，那將是一件奇怪事。關於中日兩國衝突的原因，不相互思索其必然性，而祇說「我長」「你短」，相互攻擊對方行爲，則中日間的衝突永久不能解決。祇要中日兩大民族都在同樣發展階段上，認爲這種鬥爭永無寗息之望者，我稱之爲中日永久鬥爭論者。事實上，大多數反駁我的　者不知不覺而陷於這種「中日永久鬥爭論者」的立塲。</p>
<p>同時，祇承認日本民族的發展性，而否認中華民族的發展性之日本人，也不知不覺陷於「中日永久鬥爭論者」的立塲。這兩個立場，都是妨礙解決中日事變的立塲、反之如果共同承認中口兩大民族的發展性，再估計到如調調整這種發展性，如何不使這種兩國的狹義的民族主義發展性相亙對立，而導引之向外部發展才能發見中日事變之合理的和平解決。</p>
<p>日本由於東亞的新「十二八」已經推翻外部嗾使中日兩大民族發展力相互衝突的力量，現在中日兩大民族的發展力，已經可能手携手地向外發展了。以前在羅馬的圓彩戲院裏，被羅馬人捉來的菲洲與叙利亞俘虜相互格鬥，以供羅馬市民賞玩。中日兩國人民因爲是有色人種，曾被澳洲抵制，曾被美國驅逐，而在祗限於東亞的天地內反相爭不已，此情此景正與羅馬圓形戲院的格鬥，以供英美賞玩毫無二致，於圓形戲院格鬥的菲洲人與叙利亞人，由於相亙仇恨，而竟相互砍殺到最後一人，於是滿足了羅馬市民的眼福。如中日兩國人民，由於相互仇恨而砍殺到最後一人，像羅馬市民那樣高興的，當然就是英美了。大東亞戰爭形成的新客觀形勢，摧段了圍繞中日兩國人民的圓形戲院。現在正是中日兩國人民，要求參觀者支付相當入場費的時候了。三十二年五月二十九日（瑢譯）</p>

<p>吳叔同開會辭</p>
<p>略謂：「上海爲全國文化之中心，近年以來，因種種關係，文化界之空氣，十分沉寂，而出版事業之衰落，尤爲顯着。同人等受與論之督促，與各方之期望，因有本公司之組織。故本公司雖爲一純粹之商業機關，但經費之範圍，乃屬於出版事業，與一般商業機關，微有不同，而爲一種文化的商業機關·　自戰事發動以來，兵災所及，文化敎育之事業，勢不免暫時之毀壞與停止。東南沿海區域，以上海爲中心。五六年中，文化敎育，不論有形無形，損失之大，無待　言，倘不急　刷，則　日　延·恢復愈難，其影響於民族之　　生活，至深且重，同人等以爲文化之振興，在平時固屬重要，而在戰時，其重要爲尤甚。　是　　軍力，以謀出版事業之復興，期於文化敎育有　微之貢獻，在文化事業創傷之餘，略　補苴之貴，直接爲讀者大眾服務，間接爲國家民族服務」云云。</p>
<p>市長代表訓詞</p>
<p>略謂：「上海自事變以來，受戰事影響，而略事消沉。但　們不　以戰事而放棄這文化出版事業，文化事業，在戰時的雖有與平時有不同的辦法，以戰時物資，人才的關係，須用新的方式來經營，才能使出版事業發達。今天中聯出版公司的開幕，可說是適合時代的，在戰時體制之下的有力的組織。今後本市的出版事業，一定可以由振興起來，俾獲更大的進步」云云。</p>
<p>李部長代表詞</p>
<p>略謂：「敎育部與出版界的關係，是非常密切的，敎育部在國家行政上，負有發展文化的使命，而出版界在團體事業上，具有推進文化的性能。本部認爲欲發展中國的文化，非先使出版界有健全的組織與順利的進行不爲功，所以本部已往與今後的態度，是一貫的對於出版界盡力促成並扶助其發展。本人在舉派參加這個隆重開幕典禮的機會，敬謹願祝貴公司的事業與中國的文化共同蒸蒸日上，達到了光明燦爛的境地」云云。</p>
<p>岡崎部長致詞</p>
<p>田尻公使代表岡崎總務部長詞：「今日中國聯合出版公司成立，在日人眼中，最表快慰者，當爲田尻公使，惜因公赴東京，未能參加。出版事業，雖不是文化本身，如無出版業，則文化不能發達，因此出版事業對於文化關係重要。日人對中國五千年來文化發達，最爲敬　，凡入中等學校之學生，即須學習漢文，故研究中國古代文化，在日本爲最普通而熱烈之現象，較習歐美文化，尤覺重要。但中國現代文化，尙少有人注意，以個人感想，中日關係密切，應即熱心研究。中日文化如能交流，始能談到兩國新結合。中日人民交往，早已開始，雖有時稍有　折，但兩國關係較任何國家緊密，不待申引。總理遺訓，即已瞭解東亞民族團結爲最迫切而需要者，今中國各大書局，合組中國聯合出版公司，今後對中國新文化發揚，具有極大希望，是誠値得慶賀。本人尤盼貴公司舍發揚中國固有文化外，並多介紹日本文化。」</p>
<p>馮處長詞</p>
<p>近半年來上海文化界，有兩大事件，一即數月前新開聯會成立，再則即爲今日在國聯合出版公司成立，。曾　新聯合成立時，說新聞聯合會成立，無眞對英美投下巨彈，今貴公司成立，茍於由南洋運到大批食糧。無論中日人士，對於精神食糧，均情熱烈企盼，今貴公司成立，不　得到大宗米煤，因物質食糧與精神食糧，同樣重要。今後精神食糧，可　獲得解決，故寭義實甚重人。蓋每一地方之文化發　，即可表示該地文化進步。在國府治下之和平區域文化工作，刻正一力復興。此次貴公司成立，爲睹君勞力之結果，並得大邦　大援助，幸苦所得，必能發揚光大，本人誠以十二分誠意，祝貴公司　程發風光大。</p>
<p>聞蘭亭詞</p>
<p>略謂：「在最近戰爭時期中，中國之文化潮流，不免低落停滯。由於經濟狀況之不良，致一般人受物價猛漲之壓迫。輾轉於飢寒之中，無法享受純潔之文化生活。欲脫離此種物質支配之惡劣環境，一方固須人民之自己覺悟，自己認識，一方是須有從事文化事業之機關，努力倡導，努力推進。今中國聯合出版公司之成立，即適應此種需要，深望中國聯合出版公司諸位同人，對於此點，能有明白的體認」云云。</p>
<p>改造社山本社長詞</p>
<p>國家物質，惟恐囤積，惟文化囤積，愈多愈好，目前戰爭不單恃武器。政治文化同樣重要。並申述日本國內以運輸關係，出版業受紙張限制，縮減篇幅情形，希望中國出版界，利用實踐紙張，多作有利東亞之文化宣揚云云。</p>

<p>— 栗本寅治</p>
<p>上月十七日，十九日及二十日的申報，三度撰論，爲華北急賑問題大聲疾呼：題爲：「爲華北災民請命，」「再爲華北災荒呼籲」「刻不容緩的華北賑濟」，洋洋數千言之長文，不厭求詳，繁複說明；魯豫兩省因連年旱災而農產歉收，尤其是去年的大荒，以致該地人民苦不勝言，描寫其逼迫之情勢，與慘苦之嚴重，極爲悽慘動人，力言刻不容緩，急待救濟的實情，本人也曾接到敝公司駐外辦事員的報吿，得悉華北因去年大荒，而人民慘痛的情形：據聞某地，流民因不得食物，所以草根樹皮，掘削殆盡，甚大嚼而允一時之飢，這是何等悽慘，何等酸鼻的消息。</p>
<p>救濟災民的急迫，不獨申報有此感覺，就是全中國人士，誰不着急，大家都希望這一次的急賑，要出動得比上海的救護車更快，更速，誰沒有熱烈的同胞之愛呢？不僅是中國人士如此，就是鄰邦日本人士，也應該參加這個急賑，無奢我祖國正拼國運而從事於擊滅英美，所以對於中國的這種災禍，雖有無限同情，然而無法直接施救，這是不得已的實情。所以我在化日僑，在盡職後方服務之餘，對友邦中國災民，非寄以嶼不可，中國雖索以地大物博著稱，然就中國的人口與其生產而觀，亦未必能肯定物博兩字。中國雖然地大，可是一年之中的大小天災人禍在那裏的，一年裏頭所遭到的大小災禍之中，並不是事前人力所不能防止的，不過就今日中國的人智與社會組織來觀，怕不是容易的，所以就消極一點來說，應該考慮設立一個經常救援的機關，而且這種設施也就是新興中國的政治上課題，連年農產歉收，去　災禍尤甚，所以這不是今日的災害，而是半年前或比半年更前，就有了今日災荒的預兆，但因救濟機關的缺如，以致造成了今日的慘禍，事到如今，大聲疾呼賑災，縱使不虛此言，然而結果能不能有實效，恐怕還相去甚遠。</p>
<p>往年華中，華北發生到天災人禍，大槪都由民間自　　法疏通所需的急賑物資，採取應急措　，災害雖不能全免，可是其大部份能先得救。但目今戰時之下的經濟情形，因爲莫測而阻碍了華北華中物資的自由交流，這　是不得已的事態，不過通貨關係物資移動限制，尤其是糧食交流的不易，也足使災害程度加重，這是無可否認的事實，疏通對華北糧食，與賑濟義舉，並相推進確信此賑濟義舉，必能更使其有效。</p>
<p>不過中國地大，一年之中說不定在那裏遭災，今日救了華北之急，雖保明天別處不遭災殃，旣想起華北的旱災，再應該預先考慮華中的水災，所以趁這一次華北旱災的機會，南京中央政府必須研究灌漑，治水的人力所及的措施，積極以防災患，一方面常設如賑濟的機關，大量勸募，同時發行賑濟債券，或賣賑濟彩票，用多種方法，謀賑濟資金的充足，以備一朝有事之際，可以從容撥用，就中國現在的國情來看，這是適當辦法而值得提倡的。這裏且來說一句另外的話，中國從前常有官方民間的募捐等事，然而其賑濟能惠及　正災黎者，實在少得很，多數倒是半途裏無聲無臭的被人中飽了，這是多麼遺憾，居安思危，所以我想起此情，但願此點不復見於今日。積穀防飢，也是要安定生活的必然心理。（雲鵬：譯自五月三十一日大陸新報）</p>
<h3 id="c36">鄰邦人士的義務 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>最近全滬市民，大聲疾呼，急賑華北災荒，這是值得注意的。南京國民政府也已首先發動，採取積極對策。此時此地，我們僑華日人，豈可坐視鄰邦人士的悲慘苦楚。</p>
<p>……我們現在傾一切爲祖國興亡而戰，雖細至絲毫之物資與力量，也不能遺漏而必須動　到戰爭目的，這樣說來，我們對於華北的無數災黎，是不是單說幾句漂亮的話，而不想一點具體救濟辦法呢？不，絕對不是這個意思，一定要想一個辦法來拯救，我們不是絕無辦法的赤貧者，應該有一分力盡一分力量。</p>
<p>！…華北的災荒，不是新的問題。災荒最重的河南省，差不多有好些地方還是重慶轄境。所以重慶早就準備救濟運動，而且聽說美國也在發起同樣運動。事實上美國對此並沒有憐憫，以及人道主義的思想，不過借此籠絡重慶，談不上什麼救濟。</p>
<p>……重慶和美國，已經先做此種工作，但是我們做這種救濟工作，祇要發自誠意，無所謂先後，就是從現在做起，也不算遲，救濟物資的實量，並不是一個問題，眞正的出發點，還在於把災民的痛苦，當作自己的痛苦，更要存着，他們今日的生活，就是他們明日的命運。</p>
<p>……上海的華方市民，對此問題抱極大關心。這自然是人情之常，可是看到今日上海的生活環境之困難，他們肯集資集物來援救同胞，這裏可以發見極深的意義。本來上海人被人指爲更新喪失了國籍的冷血人種，但是現在這樣熱誠的救濟運動，願意刻苦自己來助他人，這種誠心誠意的表現，是不甘受此惡聲的抗議。我們對於這種事實，也應該在同生共死的關係上起來努力吧！（雲鵬：譯自五月三十日大陸新報社論）</p>
<h3 id="c37">經濟界　譯載　商統會最近工作目標 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>商統會自五月二十日起改隸行政院後，積極推進下層　構組織，類定在六月十五日左右全部完竣，並設立各種物資最高統制部門之專業委員會，一部份已成立，其他尚在準備之中，工作前途之發動基礎，亦吿確立，今後必能作健全之活動。該會最近工作目標，大體如次：</p>
<p>（一）成立聯合會之方針　實業糧食兩部，曾決定成立二十二種聯合會，但改隸行政院後之商統會，是否繼承前所決定之方針，刻下尚定妥，正在研究之中，但結果或將先行成立一部份重要之聯合會。</p>
<p>（二）對於專業委員會之指導編制，專業委員會，決定設立紛麥委員會，糖業委員會，棉業委員會，油糧委員會四委員會，前二種，業已成立，後兩種，不久亦可成立，又聞理監事會並有此種意向，認爲必要時，除上聞專業委員會之外，並得設置若干其他專業委員會，不過　下尚未完全決定。專業委員會，應受抑事會之指導監督，其委員等亦歸理監事任免，例如粉麥專業委員會之主任委員，亦擬由商統會理事江上達氏擔任，足見理監事會與專業委員會絕無絲毫隔膜。</p>
<p>（三）關於理監事之選舉　商統會旣爲自治編制機關，其理監事當然爲民選，但民選應先將同業公會，與其聯合會擴充確立爲自治機關，然後自下層機構中推出代表而決定，現在下層機構尚未完全確立，故尚無法選舉理監事。</p>
<p>有人以爲理監事會之人物僅爲上海財界之代表者，不無缺乏全國性，但是上海財界之領袖同時亦爲地方財界支配者，是以可綜合上海代表之性格與地方代表之性格，此點並無重大問題。</p>
<p>（四）企劃研究機關之設置　爲求商統會工作之全面發展起見。該會內部亦有人主張設一直屬於商統會之綜合性之企劃研究機關，此項意見，雖頗濃厚，但尚未完全具體化，相信隨軍組織工作之進展，必有權威機關產生，將單求中日商界利益之工作目標放大，進一步而負起計劃統制經濟之重大任務。（雲鵬：譯自六月一日大陸新報）</p>

<p>— 林英</p>
<p>喊：三年的分別，想不到你竟改變到這般地沙，一個熱誠活潑的靑年，竟陷人這樣悲觀，消極，陰鬱，苦悶的深瀟，終至屈膝在病魔之下。潮熱，咯血，輾轉床第，屏棄了一切的希望。唉！生活的磨折，經濟的壓榨，是這樣的殘酷啊！</p>
<p>我還未曾見你一而，但是我可以想象到你那慘白的面容和瘦削的身軀，從你的字跡中，從你的語句中，已描繪出你的近影，學業典禮時的那張照片，我還懸掛在壁上，你立衣正中，那豐滿的兩類，炯炯的目光，不禁又使我黯然神傷了。</p>
<p>我沒有勇氣來鼓勵你，我更不願意虛假的來安慰，我又無力量來幫助你，你也許要怪我恨我，知己的友人爲什麽竟如此的淡漢。是的，這是我的罪過，熱烈的友情，已不能溫暖你冷去的心，我向你同情，萬分的同情，但對你有什麼益處呢？你是犧牲者。這不合理的社會組織，這不適用的敎育制度之下的犧牲者啊，我詛咒，我想推翻，我圖改造，但是……所以我說沒有勇氣來鼓勵你，不願虛假的來安慰你，更沒有力量來幫助你</p>
<p>你用酒精來刺激你的神經，又想跳河，以了結你的殘生，你已走向未路，也許是無法挽救了。星期日那天，我一定來看你，見了你的面，我將要向你痛哭，我對你是最有希望的，但是最有希望的人而今却絕　了，怎不叫人傷心。不過，絕望當中我還抱着希望，希望跟着你的脚步正走上你這條路的許多靑年能夠得救，誠！你犧牲了，我忍心的訊一句，你不久就要離開這人世了。到那時，我將把你的屍體橫臥在你走的這條路的口頭，當作一個警吿的碑記，一方面使筏來的大看了，自己有個深深的覺醒；一方面使那些領路的人看了，痛切的覺悟到是有改換方向的必要。這樣，你該是願意的吧！苒會。傑上</p>

<p>— 百利</p>
<p>天氣日漸炎幫，打防疫針早已開始，一般這在自以爲，上等階級』的人們，好像感到很麻煩似的，他們以爲這是施於『下等階級」的，對於「上等階級」是一件多餘的事，可是當局規定，必須挨戶搜查，假使沒有防疫證的，便强迫注射，並且不許在馬路上通行。於是，他們便『未雨綢繆」，去設法『一張」。他們以爲惟有如此，才配稱爲「上等階級』，才夠得上「體面」其實，這正是顯出他們的沒有常識。</p>
<p>須知打防疫針，不是一件「裝門面』的事，是有關公衆健康的，它是公共衛生範圍內的工作。雖然，在表面上看來，打與不打，與旁人無關，其實，假使你也規避，我也規避，那末「疫」必定不能「防」，而結果要流行了，其爲害豈僅個人而已。去夏疫虎盛行的可怕，諒必尙未遺忘吧！所以希望今後不再發生上述的逃避的妙法，打了防疫針，才是眞的「未雨觸繆」呢！希望大家趕快去注射，尤其是希望學校的校長，教師，工廠，商店的經理，高級戰員，以及每戶的戶長們，自己先去注射，以爲學生，職工，及子女們的表率。</p>

<p>— 大下宇陀兒</p>
<p>（九）休息的可喜</p>
<p>現世的人，常以不堪耐受的忙碌，了不得的無暇而訴苦，但在海軍學校中，或在軍艦上，沒有聽見誰說過那樣的話。</p>
<p>可是這忙碌在戰鬥的時候還要厲害呢，但也有例外，在這戰鬥的時俟內，因英雄無用武之地而獲得空閒而退休，從艦橋退入士官室，與其他船員似瘋狂般在盡他們的職務，完全不同者，有二種人。</p>
<p>其一是軍醫長。</p>
<p>海上砲聲隆隆，激起丈餘長的水柱，正在進行激烈的戰鬥，在這時候，軍聲長反因空閑而退休下來，正表示着夥伴們的負傷之稀少。所以這退休到反而是很可喜的。</p>
<p>其二是航空母艦的砲術長。</p>
<p>航空母艦者、從其甲板送出飛機至距離甚遠的地點攻擊敵人。從其性能上看來，如其航空母艦的行動是適切而有效的話，那時砲術長是沒有用的。假使直接和敵艦開火，或受到敵機的攻擊。那未砲術長就要忙得不亦樂乎。然而這不是好現象。平常砲術長總是很空閑的，撫摩着砲身，等待友機功成歸來。</p>
<p>除了軍　長和航空母艦的砲術長以外，航空隊整備兵等，如其在戰斗中有空閑，那也是很好的。整備兵在飛機出發前調整發動機完了後，難得不爲了修理而忙碌。整備兵與軍聲長不同、即使沒有修嘎、另外還有各種任務。不通如其沒有因受敵彈而發生　害或破樣，因而無需修理，這不是很明白的是一種可喜的現象嗎？</p>
<p>（十）黑暗的習慣</p>
<p>防空訓練的燈火管制中，在黑暗裏，結束服裝。任屬上的監視晴，覺得很爲困難。我寫了一封信給某知己的二等整備兵曹，信內說：</p>
<p>「但是終不能成爲習慣慣了之後，即使在黑暗中，也能夠做相常的事情。所以我常常要那樣做。」</p>
<p>詳細不得而知，那大槪像是在某航空基地的事情。不限於海軍機，即陸軍機也一樣罷！攻擊敵人歸來的飛機，爲了「像突破陣雨般」的彈幕，而　受相當的損害。於是須不分　夜的加以修理，但是敵人也以基地爲目標，前來轟炸，所以夜間須非常的注意。在完全的燈火管制中，整備員時常在黑暗裏用手摸索，從事修理，一顆螺絲，一支釘，也不粗忽遺漏。想到這飛機是用以攻擊敵人的時候，即在那樣的黑暗中，也專心一志，立刻完成圓滿的修理。（異：譯自朝日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c52">出征（五） <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 海軍報道班員濱本浩著</p>
<p>九　七首戰法</p>
<p>艇長靠着接述艦橋的旗甲板的欄杆上、繼續着說話。</p>
<p>「提起所羅門海戰的實例。你也許知道，奇嬰簡直是我們海軍的拿手好戲。當時暗藏七首刺向敵人咽喉者是水電部隊。冒着槍林彈雨，穿過怒濤駭浪，向敵方主力衝鋒，給敵人以致命傷者，是我們水電部隊。但我們的艇從未想到防禦。所以捨身戰法，必須是具有一發必中的信念然後行動方可。這就是日本傳統的俠客精神。」</p>
<p>在這一點上，艇長和水電部隊，和淸水决耶長連結到一起了。</p>
<p>『我自從兒童時代就喜歡俠客的生活。所謂俠客精神，決不是世上傳說的那樣輕浮事件。必須是隱忍自重，貫澈無我的生活。在我們的戰法當中，也應用這種精神。無我戰法——你懂得麼</p>
<p>「這眞不容易懂。」</p>
<p>『到了明大，你就會知道。在黃昏前，因爲一定脅遇見敵人。艇長這樣和他約好了。</p>
<p>「但我從、淸水老前輩學習到的還有一件事。』艇長又繼續地說下去、</p>
<p>「淸水老前輩曾說過、自己的劍若此敵人　時，就要拿着短劍刺向前去。你知道麼？假設自　已的射程很短、那就要衝向前去射擊。但衝向前去時不要表示出自己的弱點來、一面壓迫着敵人·一面向前衝。對於這一點，就需要信念和技術。幸而自己的船員都曾有過充分的訓練。運用這一點，就要靠指揮者的精神。明白了麼？」</p>
<p>這是誰都會認爲對的話。然而在眞正作戰的塲合，是否能運用出來，這是江戶衣內心裏不安的地方。</p>
<p>「明天就會知道的。若是心中拿定主意，一切都不成問題。」艇長又說了一次明天。</p>
<p>那個「明天」的天，自早晨以來就沒有一片雲霧，只是西北的季候風在颼颼地吹着。</p>
<p>「黑金」號自從別離基地港以來，不斷地警戒着敵人，而護送着兩艘運輸船。</p>
<p>所謂護送，就不是用七首的奮襲，也不是舷舷相磨擦的海戰。拖着商船一面要驅逐飛機和擊退潛水艇而一面必須要完成任務，這眞是乾燥無法的作戰、也是項困雖的作戰。</p>
<p>艇、一直向南前進在午後已經進到敵方的空襲圈了。</p>
<p>第一次上陣的砲術長，立在天蓋上面的瞭望台上。左右各有　一位瞭望員、把着雙眼望遠鏡，四面八方地警戒着。</p>
<p>鐵板逐漸地熱起來。放在望遠鏡上的兩隻眼睛，像針刺一般地痛。</p>
<p>下午二時左右在右舷看到椰樹叢叢的一個小島。好像沒有　居民的樣子。</p>
<p>二時半左右艦橋上的瞭望員肯定地承認是敵機遠影馬上通知天蓋處的瞭望員。</p>
<p>天蓋處的瞭望員把着望遠鏡報告說：　「Ｂ十七號飛機六架結隊向我艇飛來。」</p>
<p>十　會戰</p>
<p>敵機眨眼間飛近了，並降低高度，三架三架地左右分開。信號兵跑到天蓋上來，用旗語命令後隨來的商船準備迎擊敵人。艇即開足速力，一面傾斜着一面在商船的周圍急駛。掠過舷側的濤浪飛沫，一直升到天蓋。</p>
<p>敵機在船隊的上空降低而投下炸彈。</p>
<p>『左面三架飛機投落炸彈了。」衣艦橋上有人這樣大聲喊。在商船與商船之問，突然昇起黑色的水柱，而接着又一堆一堆地倒下來。</p>
<p>另外三架飛機則倏忽間降低，迫近艇的上空。艇長頻頻命令轉舵，但不發命令射擊。</p>
<p>敵機的黑影，颶地一聲掠過天蓋，艇長又命令轉舵追趕飛機</p>
<p>江戶眞有點莫明其妙了。於是便對向傳聲曾問：『艇長，射擊麽？』</p>
<p>突然，天蓋的窗戶打開，而艇長的而孔露出來。</p>
<p>「等一等」，艇長微笑着這這樣說。</p>
<p>江戶追趕着敵機的影踪，而在後面行走着。突然，在機關室的入口處洧一個人在站着。自膝至踝捲着螺旋形的裏腿布，頭戴鋼盔、對向天空描準步槍，這位就是副機關長小政．</p>
<p>「渾蛋！」</p>
<p>艇長對着上甲板用傳聲器罵着大聲笑了。小政仰望艦橋，而沒聽到說什麽話。</p>
<p>由於小政的奇怪行爲，而艦橋的空氣突然動搖，而立刻又恢復原來的緊張狀態了。</p>
<p>三架敵機對向艇的頭部飛下來了，並非敵機飛來，而是艇划向敵機。</p>
<p>『射擊！」</p>
<p>這是艇長的聲音。江戶便接着命令說：『射擊開始！』</p>
<p>砲塔隨即一齊吐出來。機關槍也繼續不斷地射着。全艇由於反應而激烈地震動着。</p>
<p>敵機一架突然在異的附近買出白烟，未幾，便變成大的火燄。火談迅速地擴大，面成爲火球，但意外緩慢地落到海面。</p>
<p>那時，艇長已經離開墜落處五百公尺了。耀眼睛的火燄在海面上顫動着，漸而變成烏黑的烟，便被風撕成細綫。</p>
<p>在天空中、有兩個降落傘飄飄搖搖地動蕩着。那一定是敵方駕駛員逃出飛機了。</p>
<p>『砲術長！請看！那個傢伙他吊下來了。』</p>
<p>一看瞭望員所指的方向，在艇的相反方向飛過去的兩架飛機之中的一架，在機尾上掛着黑烟，慢慢地降落着，朱幾便接觸到海面上。</p>
<p>信號兵跑上來，在招呼已經離開很遠的商船。</p>
<p>『艇長！我們收容降落傘下來的傢伙吧１』</p>
<p>江戶這樣問了一下艇長。艇長又從天窗上露出面孔來，而精神奕奕地說：『我們要趕路的。不要和這些蠢貨們打交涉，讓海沙魚招待他們吧！』像默誦台詞一樣地同答。在艦橋上，士官們的究聲熱鬧起來。</p>
<p>江戶也興奮起來，學着艇長的口吻說：秃讓海沙魚招待他們吧！」</p>
<p>『黑金』號前面航駛，後面緊跟着兩艘商船。像從未發生事故似地，繼續不斷地向南前。（濤譯自朝日新聞。全文完）</p>

<p>（二）丁福保先生就老人營養衛生問題、發表意見：每個人都希望活得壽長，要達到這目的，並非難事，最重要的是要改變一般人的錯誤觀念。有些人以爲開窗會使人傷風咳嗽；吃肉吃魚吃輩颶可使身體强壯、共實大謬不然，開窗可使室內空氣新鮮，養成習慣後，非但不偶風，不咳嗽，身體反而强壯吃輩腥，如牛·羊·豬·蟹蝦等，有時竟要中毒，或者會使血壓增高，血管變硬，反而促短了壽命。我們常見鄉下有些老老，平日不大吃魚吃肉，竟享天年，可知吃素確是有益的。德國元首希特勒，印度聖雄廿地都是主張素食的蔬菜不可燒得太透，太透了，維他命就消失。一個人不宜多吃東西，多吃無益有害。一日三餐，不妨改爲兩賚，水果一物，在飲食衛生上極有價值，不過蘋果香蕉價錢很貴，可以蘿葡番茄代替，惟須生食。牙齒好的人可以嚼來吃，牙齒不好的人可榨汁來喝·要長壽，除須改革飲食外，還有一稱靜坐法，亦極有效騐。靜坐能使精神集中於一點，亦即是我國古書上所說的「凝神於玄關一竅』。其效果能使辦事精神加倍，並可延年益壽。蔣竹莊先生及本人對靜坐均有過長時期的實騐，深覺靜坐對一個人的健壽上，確有幫助，敢向各界人士介紹。</p>
<p>（三）徐卓呆先生以幽默的語調說。講講老人經，本人今年六十歲了，但我不知道老，同時也不承認老。平日所交友朋以靑年人爲多，老年人不過寥寥數人而已。自己覺得仍年靑，不知老之將至。八年前在一個偶然的機緣中購到了一本名叫『四十歲以後無病生活法』的書，是日本的一個醫學博士著的。我讀了這書以後，深深地感覺到老年人是不容易做的，必須要有常識。八年來，我就言中說到的，將可能做到的，照着做。這部書正在譯述之中，將來的書名就叫做老人經。</p>
<p>這部書中的第一段說，人爲甚麽衰老？大意說人的衰老，完全是新陳代謝的作用。第二段說古今中外所謂長生不死·返老還童等說法·均爲一般有權勢帝王的幻想。事實上都是　不到的。第三段說，又據目今最新科學的說法·由內分泌（賀爾象）的幫助，可能使一個人保持若干的靑春。第四段裏說，四十以後的人應注意之點·如（一）每天中午吃過中飯後打一中覺，用以節力，時間五分鐘亦好，對身體大有裨益。（二）常與靑年男女交友。（三）看見頭上白髮類現，這是生理上的自然現象，無關痛癢，不必擔憂。（四）注意保持血壓及血管之常態，勿使血壓增高或血管硬化。（五）飲食物須保持正常，不可過度。此外還有關於性生活等。</p>

<h3 id="e1">On the Urgent Relief of North China - Fourth Discourse <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the urgent relief of North China, we have repeatedly and earnestly appealed, not fearing to speak exhaustively. The core of our hope lies in the idea of "treating disaster relief as fighting a fire." Besides offering various suggestions concerning official relief, charitable relief, the establishment of relief organizations, the selection of relief personnel, the formulation of relief methods, and the collection of relief funds and materials, there is a particular need for agility and a swift undertaking of tasks, so that the suffering of our compatriots in the disaster area can be alleviated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly received the outpouring of the highest human compassion from our readers, who have contributed money and materials, continuously and enthusiastically. In the past half-month alone, this newspaper has collected over 300,000 yuan on behalf of the effort. As for the organization responsible for overall urgent relief, it has already been established in Nanjing. In this city, the relevant authorities have also completed preparations, and the "Shanghai All-Circles Urgent Relief Association for North China" will be formally established today. Now that there is an urgent relief organization responsible for overall management, it should bring into play and utilize concentrated efforts to handle everything. We still hope that this organization can act with speed and decisiveness, meeting the ardent expectations of society. We would like to offer our views again for reference:</p>
<p>First, for this urgent relief effort, whether leaders, workers, or donors, all should take "serving to rescue the compatriots in the disaster area of North China" as their sole objective. At the same time, they should clearly recognize the "heavy responsibility" and the "urgency of the situation," and make redoubled efforts. Under this spirit, whether it is official relief or charitable relief, there should be sincere cooperation and concerted efforts. We must understand that the establishment of organizations is for disaster relief; the fundraising and donations are for disaster relief; the efforts to connect and coordinate are for disaster relief; and the raising of voices in appeal is also for disaster relief. Although the forms of service may be different, the goal is the same. Disaster relief work only involves obligations, never rights; it should only benefit the disaster victims, and there should be no public or private distinctions. Criticize oneself as one criticizes others, and trust others as one trusts oneself. Those in charge should be sincere and work hard in their respective tasks; those not in charge should strictly supervise and encourage their spirit, and hold them accountable for their effectiveness. Those in charge have responsibilities, and those not directly in charge also have responsibilities. In short, "alleviating the suffering of the disaster victims as soon as possible" is when we can consider our responsibilities fulfilled and our hearts at peace.</p>
<p>Second, urgent relief should be urgent, and the methods and techniques for extinguishing sparks cannot be adapted to a raging fire. If it is not easy to quickly collect huge sums of relief funds, then one should negotiate with national banks to obtain loans, which will be repaid with the donated funds raised in the future, or issue bonds to make up for the shortfall. Here, we will reiterate the suggestions made by Mr. Lin Kanghou and Mr. Zhang Yipeng in the editorial of this newspaper on May 20 regarding borrowing from the Central Reserve Bank and issuing disaster relief public bonds. As for the principles of relief, the article "From North China Disaster Relief to the Prerequisites for Disaster Relief" by Mr. Zhang Yipeng in the weekly commentary of this newspaper on May 23 is also worth consulting.</p>
<p>Third, the procurement and transportation of relief supplies require the full assistance of the authorities of friendly nations stationed in China. We hope that in addition to the negotiations by the responsible authorities, the authorities of friendly nations can spontaneously show the highest compassion.</p>
<p>Economic expert Mr. Kurimoto Toraji from a friendly nation published an article in the Continental News a few days ago entitled "Thoroughly Relieving the Famine in North China," and the Continental News also published an editorial entitled "The Obligation of Neighboring Countries" (both can be found on page 4 of today's newspaper), both expressing sympathy. Although Japan is currently devoting all its strength to war purposes and does not have much surplus capacity to actually help Chinese disaster victims, it will still do its best. We are grateful for this expression of sympathy. We recall the past examples of mutual assistance in times of disaster between China and Japan. For example, on September 1, 1923, when a major earthquake occurred in Japan, the Chinese Beijing government convened a special cabinet meeting on September 3, established the "Japan Disaster Relief Association," and allocated 200,000 yuan to help with the relief efforts. Overseas Chinese in Japan allocated another 100,000 yuan for relief and lifted the ban on rice exports; Guangdong established the "Disaster Relief Association," with Wu Chaoshu and Liao Zhongkai as chairman and vice-chairman; Shanghai established the "National Relief Association for Japanese Disaster Relief," donated 120,000 yuan worth of relief supplies, and dispatched the Xinming Wheel to transport rice for relief; Tianjin established the "Relief Comrades Association"; the Northeast also donated 500,000 yuan worth of relief supplies, and Zhang Yuting donated 100,000 yuan himself. Others such as Duan Qirui personally donated 100,000 yuan, Cao Kun 40,000 yuan, and Xu Shichang, Cao Rulin, and others also made donations. People across the country enthusiastically donated, and the fervent situation is still vividly remembered. Moreover, we remember that at that time, there were rifts in the relationship between China and Japan, but the Chinese people were still able to help others in need and enthusiastically provide assistance, never reducing their enthusiasm for disaster relief due to diplomatic relations. This attitude is the embodiment of the spirit of peace and universal love of the Chinese nation. In July 1931, China suffered severe flooding, and the disaster was extremely serious. The Japanese Emperor also allocated 100,000 Japanese yen, which was a powerful contribution to our disaster relief and post-disaster efforts. This sincere friendship in disaster relief and helping neighbors, and the highest compassion for all people under heaven, are virtues shared by both the Chinese and Japanese nations. Moreover, now that China and Japan are closely cooperating for common survival, our compatriots in North China are encountering such a miserable situation. Although we cannot force others to do what is difficult, we hope that friendly nations will not force others to do what is difficult, we hope that friendly nations will provide full convenience to the authorities stationed in China in terms of transporting relief supplies and relaxing the control of relief materials. We believe that we will surely receive sympathy and assistance.</p>
<p>Finally, what we should particularly report is Mr. Pan Sanxing's generous donation of a large sum of money. Mr. Pan delivered a donation of 50,000 yuan last night to purchase 50 boxes of cigars from Mr. Yuan Ludeng for charitable purposes, but he did not take the cigars for himself. Instead, he is willing to sell them again piecemeal for charitable purposes, and donate all the proceeds. Mr. Pan was not satisfied, and he also offered a diamond ring (weighing five carats) and a jade offering vase for charitable sale, with the proceeds to be donated. According to experts, the minimum price for the former is 160,000 yuan, and the latter is 10,000 yuan. He entrusted this newspaper to handle the charitable sale. We express our deep gratitude to Mr. Pan for his generosity in donating both money and goods. At the same time, we hope that wealthy people in Shanghai will follow suit and jointly participate in this charitable cause, strengthening the relief funds so that this urgent relief work in North China can be successfully completed through multifaceted efforts. This will not only save thousands of lives from suffering, but also fully demonstrate the spirit of universal love and the power of unity of our Chinese nation. We cannot but express our hope for this.</p>
<p>At the same time, we thank Mr. Yoshida from a friendly nation for generously donating 1,000 yuan, and Mr. Mizushima for generously donating 300 yuan, setting an example for people from friendly nations.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Establishing a True Decisive Battle System: Japan to Convene Extraordinary Diet; Cabinet Approves Guidelines for Enterprise Consolidation; Extraordinary Diet Scheduled for Mid-Next Month <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – In order to cope with the current phase of continuous decisive battles and to establish a true decisive battle system with national unity, the Japanese government has decided to convene the 82nd Extraordinary Diet on the 15th of next month. It is currently drafting urgent bills and budget proposals to be submitted to the Diet. Regarding the central issue of this Extraordinary Diet, namely the problem of enterprise consolidation, the Planning Board has been working actively with the relevant authorities, including the Army, Navy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Ministry of Health and Welfare, to formulate a plan. This plan was formally decided upon after being submitted for discussion at the regular cabinet meeting on the 1st. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, the Information Bureau announced the main points of the guidelines for strengthening war efforts and consolidating enterprises, as well as a statement by Planning Board President Suzuki on the matter. The fundamental principles for strengthening war capabilities and consolidating enterprises are: (1) to actively accelerate the war capabilities of those that have not yet been strengthened, and (2) to further consolidate and strengthen important industrial sectors to a high degree. Therefore, after this enterprise consolidation, Japan's direct enhancement of war capabilities, centered on the five major key industries of coal, iron, light metals, aircraft, and ships, can be quickly realized.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government held a regular cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 AM on the 1st. Prime Minister Tojo and all cabinet members were present. First, Planning Board President Suzuki explained in detail the basic guidelines for strengthening war capabilities and consolidating enterprises. After the cabinet members exchanged views, they were approved. Subsequently, Prime Minister Tojo explained the policy of establishing a decisive battle posture. After the cabinet members exchanged views, they decided not to hold the general election of prefectural assembly members this autumn as a preliminary step, and decided to submit the relevant bills to the 82nd Extraordinary Diet before adjourning. Prime Minister Tojo also stated at the meeting that the implementation of establishing a decisive battle posture is an urgent task and proposed that all activities not directly related to strengthening war capabilities be canceled. This proposal was unanimously approved by all cabinet members. The gist of Prime Minister Tojo's proposal is as follows: Because the current situation is extremely important, all citizens of the country should concentrate all their time and effort on producing military supplies, increasing food production, and strengthening transportation. Therefore, the national labor mobilization posture should be strengthened to double the effort in order to utilize all the remaining strength of all levels of the people to enhance war capabilities. Therefore, all public and private activities not directly related to strengthening war capabilities should be reduced. The general election of prefectural assembly members is scheduled for the autumn of this year, but it seems inappropriate for the people to waste their time and effort on elections during this critical period of striving to increase food production. Therefore, the government has decided not to hold the election of prefectural assembly members this autumn.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Colonel Yamazaki's Posthumous Deeds <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese General Headquarters announced that Colonel Yamazaki Yasuyo led 2,000 of his men in a bloody battle with the American army on Attu Island for two weeks and died heroically, our reporter specially interviewed Lieutenant Colonel Shibusawa, a managing director of the China Broadcasting Association and a classmate of Colonel Yamazaki at the military academy. He revealed the following about Colonel Yamazaki's life: I and Colonel Yamazaki were classmates in the 25th class of the military academy. I recall that Colonel Yamazaki was a fourteen or fifteen-year-old boy at the time. He transferred from Nagoya Youth School to Tokyo Central Youth School (now the preparatory course of the military academy), and our feelings as classmates were very close. After graduating from the military academy, we also met or exchanged letters from time to time. Later, due to the September 18th Incident, we separated. But I was very saddened to hear the announcement from the General Headquarters that Colonel Yamazaki had died heroically. Colonel Yamazaki was bold and had a spirit of perseverance in his youth school days. He got along well with his classmates and was highly respected. Whenever there was a dispute among classmates, it would stop as soon as Mr. Yamazaki arrived. Also, in Nagoya Youth School, he contracted severe sunstroke due to swimming. After being treated by doctors, he vowed that he would dedicate his life to his duties. In addition, Colonel Yamazaki received Spartan training from Lieutenant Colonel Tachibana, the principal of Nagoya Youth School, and martial artist Major General Habu Saburo, and was nurtured by the traditional spirit of Lieutenant Isogai and others during his time at Tokyo Central Youth School. Therefore, Colonel Yamazaki became the unparalleled and heroic assault soldier in the history of world warfare. There are many people who have died heroically, but Colonel Yamazaki is unique in that he has no desire for fame, but completes his tasks with a sense of responsibility. Therefore, Colonel Yamazaki's spirit can inspire his subordinates, wounded soldiers, and 2,000 soldiers to fulfill the great righteousness of heroic death for the country. His English name will be forever remembered by future generations.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Director of Army Press of the Japanese General Headquarters, Tani Hagi, spoke on the 1st of June about the last battle of the Japanese garrison on Attu Island: Combining enemy information, the Japanese army stationed on Attu Island will, as they have resolved, storm into the enemy group's horses near the Masagal Valley on the night of May 29, causing the enemy to flee. Other enemy lines seem to have been greatly confused as a result.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Meierle Resigns <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from Chongqing, Briton Meierle, Commissioner of Customs in Chongqing, recently submitted his resignation to the Chongqing regime, which has been approved, and he has been re-appointed as an advisor to the Chongqing Ministry of Finance. This person has served as Commissioner of Customs since 1920, which is now 14 years. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in 1941, Chongqing's customs were completely lost, so he also lost his powers and only held an empty position.</p>

<p>— Toyoshiro Fukuda</p>
<p>When the Japanese Navy was fighting a great naval battle, Vice Admiral Hwobo of the defeated enemy surrendered to our warships and said, "Today is a battle, so I'm wearing these clothes stained with coal, which is really impolite, please forgive me!"</p>
<p>Soiling oneself because of battle is a selfish idea, but for the ancient warriors of our navy, it was the spirit of wearing prepared, high-quality, clean clothes and wanting to be decorated one last time. Comparing the two, there is a world of difference, so it can be seen from this point that who would win.</p>
<p>The day after our navy won a great victory, they started their usual combat exercises as usual. This is truly the natural daily way, the samadhi of an enlightened person.</p>
<p>Tradition is growing. Both the trainer and the trained believe that daily training is war, so those who have achieved countless brilliant victories since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War are only paying the price.</p>
<p>I thought of being on a ship crossing the equator when I heard a lot about the fighting spirit of our seamen. Last January, after occupying Balikpapan, the oil capital of South Borneo, enemy planes attacked our transport ships and escort ships day and night. The enemy blindly bombed the transport ship that retreated to Kijang, and magnificent water columns were bombed all around the hull, and the surface of the water was swept by machine guns like rain. And our boats breathed fiercely and fired into the air, chasing the fleeing enemy aircraft reluctantly. Just as a cat chases a mouse, the will to fight of a boat chasing a bomber - a heroic and inviolable spirit - could not help but remind me of the hawk of our navy chasing Prince Wales, who fled at the sight of a shadow, near the coast of Malai, so I smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>If we think of the unwavering and rigorous constant. All the oceans on the radiation from this place - the majesty of our navy - do not allow us to be negligent for even a moment.</p>
<p>The soldiers on the ship are still soldiers, the warship is still a warship, only the warship flag is the epitome of the country. To see the fighting spirit gathered on this flag. The gunners who fight, the engineers who manage the interior of the warship, everyone, whether in the front or the rear, has an iron will to win. The entire Japan in battle must be like a warship. (Tao: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Australia's War Expenditure Exceeds £1 Billion: Financial Difficulties, Malignant Inflation, Only Tax Increase to Make Up the Budget <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch:</p>
<p>The London Financial News of May 27th published an article entitled "Australia in the War," which stated that according to the Australian Treasury in Canberra, by the end of this fiscal year, Australia's military expenditure in the current war will exceed £1,084,000,000, of which £450,000,000 was raised by issuing bonds, £350,000,000 was obtained from taxes, and the rest was borrowed from banks.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch:</p>
<p>Due to the abnormal development of military industries and the severe shortage of civilian supplies in Australia, malignant inflation has become even more profound, and its impact on the war is profound and significant. According to British newspapers, Australia's total expenditure in the fiscal year 1942-43 was £652 million, of which war expenditure accounted for £540 million, a considerable increase compared to the £320 million in the fiscal year 1941-42. Australia's main source of revenue is taxes. Although a tax increase was implemented from February of this year, the total tax revenue was only £260 million. The remaining £390 million had to be made up by issuing public bonds and absorbing idle funds. In addition, the shortage of materials and the increase in people's purchasing power are natural phenomena. This is one of the reasons for promoting inflation in Australia. From January of last year to January of this year, the amount of banknotes issued by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in one year was £126.1 million, an increase of £42.9 million compared to last year. The expansion of its paper money is twice the increase in the amount in circulation in previous years, which is clearly a sign of inflation. The Australian government, in view of this, has started to control prices, but has not yet implemented a material rationing system. Australia's wartime expenditure is £672 million, of which £262 million is planned to be raised by taxes, and £260 million is made up by issuing public bonds and borrowing from banks. The remaining £150 million is planned to be raised by other methods. As for its wartime national savings, in 1942 it was only £31.2 million, so the Australian authorities, in their poverty, are planning to implement a large tax increase again. The purpose of the tax increase is to raise the income tax rates for high-income and middle-income groups, but it is feared that this alone will still be difficult to achieve its intended purpose, and it will have to raise the tax rate for low-income groups. However, the current tax rate in Australia is the highest among the British Empire's self-governing territories, so it has been met with fierce opposition from all sides. Therefore, the Australian government seems to have to stop increasing taxes again. In short, Australia is currently in an extremely difficult situation, and its wartime finances can be said to have reached the end of the road.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: Since the end of the Tunisian campaign, a fierce aerial battle has unfolded on the European front. The anti-Axis forces, in order to disrupt the rear of Italy, are indiscriminately bombing cultural facilities such as hospitals, churches, and schools. The world is outraged by this brutal behavior of the anti-Axis forces, and the unity of the Italian home front is becoming even more solid. The "Katiersborg Post" also pointed out on the 31st that their blind targeting of Italy has only made the Italian people's will to fight more激昂. The indiscriminate bombing of innocent Italian citizens and precious works of art by the anti-Axis air force will also be protested by the art world around the world, it said. In addition, the Italian Air Force and ground artillery are also actively defending against the anti-Axis air force's bombings. On the island of Pantelleria alone, 57 enemy aircraft have been shot down since May 1st. In addition, Italian fighter planes shot down 66 enemy aircraft and 76 enemy aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft guns in the past week. In the past two or three days, the anti-Axis air force has not bombed German territory, but on the 29th and 30th, the German air force shot down 13 enemy aircraft (including bombers) in the Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, on the 30th, they bombed the southeastern coast of the British mainland, accurately bombing enemy harbors and military facilities from low altitude. The German Air Force's long-range bomber squadron is active on the southwest coast of Portugal. After two direct hits on a British 5,000-ton freighter, all German aircraft safely returned to base.</p>
<p>Rome, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: Local evening newspapers yesterday published photos on the cover, showing that the Church of St. Peter and Paul in Livorno had been destroyed by a recent Anglo-American air raid. The church was almost completely destroyed, with only the altar remaining intact.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: German News Agency reports that the German warning to Britain and the United States that retaliation would be taken when the time was ripe for the bombing of civilians has caused a strong reaction in Britain. Although qualified personnel in the British military and political circles said that the strength of the British and American air forces was sufficient to defend British soil, the general public still had lingering fears about the effects of the German air raids in the winter of 1940. In particular, London believes that once the German air force receives orders, it will immediately launch a planned offensive against Britain and inflict a major blow on Britain. London never underestimates the recent warnings repeatedly issued by Germany, that is, Germany's response to the British bombing will be a large-scale retaliation. The general public knows that the German air force has recently been deliberately conserving its strength, and its strength has obviously increased. The public believes that this move is not only for defense purposes. The issue of large-scale retaliation by German aircraft is becoming increasingly important in Britain, and the anxiety of the British people about this matter is even greater than the submarine war.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from Algiers, the "Central Executive Committee" of the French separatists held a meeting in Algiers yesterday afternoon. It is said that De Gaulle declared at the meeting that anyone with a tendency to cooperate with the Axis powers must not participate in the committee, because this would hinder relations with Britain and the United States. The current members of the committee are: De Gaulle, his Foreign Affairs Commissioner Massigli, Interior and Labor Commissioner Philip, Giraud, Monnet, and General Georges, who has just arrived in Algiers. It is believed that Jadot will also take a seat on the committee, and several more members will be elected within 24 hours. Yesterday's meeting lasted almost three hours, but the details are not known, but it was announced that Giraud and De Gaulle had agreed to send a joint representative to Washington to discuss the issue of French prisoners of war. At the same time, London is extremely concerned about the meeting between Giraud and De Gaulle. According to the London Times, the British authorities will not interfere for the time being.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from Algiers, the French separatists held a meeting in Algiers on the 31st and decided to establish a nine-member committee as the core of unified governance. In addition to De Gaulle, Giraud, and Jadot, seven others, two more will be elected, and the election can be completed in about a day or two.</p>
<p>Amsterdam, 31st - Central News Agency dispatch: German News Agency reports that General Giraud has appointed General Georges and General Monat as representatives to participate in the newly established Central Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: The Havas Agency reported last night from Tangier that before the leader of the North African rebels, Giraud, began negotiations with De Gaulle, he had consulted with the Soviet Foreign Ministry's representative in Algiers, Nikitin, on Sunday. However, the communique issued afterwards did not declare the nature of the meeting. Political figures in Tangier believe that Giraud has asked the Soviet representative to restrain the communists in Algiers, because they have fiercely attacked Giraud in the past few weeks and have shown pro-De Gaulle colors.</p>

<p>Rome, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: According to the Stefani Agency, the Italian newspaper said that since the anti-Axis side announced the date of invading Europe, the Axis powers are closely watching the changes in the situation and will never be caught unprepared and attacked. Moreover, in terms of the situation, the anti-Axis supreme command will never announce the exact date of the attack on Europe to the public, so we must not regard the air released by the anti-Axis side as reliable. From another point of view, Stalin's attitude is unpredictable, and the Eastern Front is unusually lonely. Before the offensive, he is waiting for Britain and the United States to fulfill their promises. The facts in the future will prove that every soldier of the Axis powers is fully prepared to deal with any environment.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: Reuters announced that the news that President Roosevelt sent a leader of a certain government-in-exile in London to Moscow on a special mission was the main topic of discussion in London political circles last night. London believes that former Czech President Benes is the most suitable candidate for this trip. When British Prime Minister Churchill visited the United States, Roosevelt and Churchill hoped to give Benes some important work. This important work is to send Benes to the Soviet Union to mediate the discord between the Soviet Union and the governments-in-exile in London, and to eliminate the doubts of the small countries in Europe about the Soviet Union. This will help Britain and the United States to wage war against Europe. London political circles also believe that Benes will discuss with the Soviet government guarantees regarding the US recognition of certain Soviet demands. Reuters confirmed this yesterday and said that Roosevelt will send a representative from a neutral party to Moscow to explain the US attitude towards the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: The Brazilian representative participating in the Hot Springs Food Conference explained at the conference the situation that his country could not handle the overproduction of coffee, saying that Brazil had burned 75 million bags of coffee in the middle of last year. This is because countries use tariff barriers to prevent coffee imports, and the ratio is so high that it is truly staggering, sometimes reaching a thousand times the original coffee price. Therefore, Brazilian coffee cannot be exported, so it has to be burned. At this moment, it is intended to ask the governments of various countries to adopt a reasonable trade policy in order to save the situation. It is reported that the 75 million bags of coffee burned by Brazil last year are enough to supply the world for three years.</p>
<h3 id="e28">A GlimMER OF HOPE FOR RESOLVING THE SINO-JAPANESE INCIDENT <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Toshisuke Yoshida</p>
<p>(1) Professor Fumio Kotake, who has researched China at the Toa Dobun Shoin for twenty years, was honored by the school authorities on May 26th. On that day, he gave a profound speech at the press conference, focusing on the core of the Sino-Japanese problem, which has been the center of attention recently. The full text is reprinted below:</p>
<p>"The foundation of Japan's planning is loyalty and righteousness, while the bond that constitutes Chinese society is trust and integrity. Zilu in the Analects mentioned that there are three ways to win the hearts of the people: trust and integrity are the best policy, financial resources are the middle policy, and military force is the worst policy. Britain and the United States have failed to win over China with the middle policy. If Japan tries to win the hearts of the Chinese people by force, it can be said to be the worst policy. Unfortunately, China's perception of Japan is that it does not trust Japan. The fundamental solution to China's problems lies in restoring lost trust. Since our country has declared the abolition of extraterritoriality and the unconditional return of enemy property, it must be thoroughly implemented. No sacrifice should be spared. This is the last chance for Sino-Japanese cooperation. Once trust and integrity are established, all issues between China and Japan can be resolved." (Mainland New Daily, May 27th)</p>
<p>As Professor Kotake said, most Japanese know that "using force to win the hearts of the Chinese people is the worst policy towards China"; however, most Chinese people today deeply believe that Japan "intends to use force to win the hearts of the Chinese people." This is the focus of the Sino-Japanese problem. If most Chinese people today understand that Japan has no intention of "using force to win the hearts of the Chinese people," the Sino-Japanese Incident would have been resolved long ago. Conversely, if Japan fails to make the Chinese people understand this point, even if Japan "thoroughly implements" "the abolition of extraterritoriality and the unconditional return of enemy property," the Sino-Japanese problem will not be satisfactorily resolved. Of course, the reason for resolutely abolishing extraterritoriality and unconditionally returning enemy property is to correct the misunderstanding of the Chinese people that Japan wants to resolve China by force, but this is by no means "the last chance." On the contrary, if we can make the Chinese people understand that Japan has no ambition to "resolve China by force," this will be the ultimate success of the policy towards China.</p>
<p>(2) After Japan "changes its policy," the most important task is to concretely prove to the Chinese people that Japan does not intend to seize China by force. Just as the Chinese people and Professor Kotake both admit that "China's perception of Japan is that it does not trust Japan," they are completely wary of every move of the Japanese. Of course, simply chanting high-sounding slogans such as "Sino-Japanese friendship," "same script, same race," and "coexistence and co-prosperity" will only increase suspicion. The only way to explain to the Chinese people is to openly and publicly review the current objective situation of China and Japan, in order to point out the inevitable path of mutual cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<p>Then, what is the current objective situation of China and Japan in Greater East Asia? Let's put aside the international situation for the moment. Within the Greater East Asia region, Japan has almost grasped its entire economic lifeline and entire strategic key points. The mission of the Japanese army is not to expand the occupied areas, but to ensure those already occupied. The particularly important issue is the development of the economy of the Greater East Asia region, in order to cultivate a war power that is absolutely invincible to the productive power of Britain and the United States. Although the Japanese authorities are not afraid of the productive power of Britain and the United States, they never underestimate it. For the East Asian economic development necessary to counter the productive power of Britain and the United States, the most important thing for Japan is manpower. Japan has technology, materials, and organizational power, but what it lacks most is manpower. However, the acquisition of manpower is by no means an insurmountable obstacle, because more than half of the world's people live in Asia. In particular, the most populous country in the world is China. In short, the question is whether this huge manpower can be mobilized. The knowledge level of Chinese and Japanese people is roughly the same. If they are given appropriate technical education, these tens of millions of people can immediately be used in any sector of modern industry. However, the fact that they are unwilling to assist Japan is true not only in terms of production, but also in all other aspects, with only differences in degree. However, as long as the Chinese people believe that Japan "intends to conquer the hearts of the Chinese people by force," they will never be willing to cooperate with Japan. For this reason, if Japan wants the Chinese people to bear the burden of the Greater East Asia War, the method of "resolving China by force" will inevitably fail. If there are still Japanese people today who "intend to win the hearts of the Chinese people by force," it can be considered that they intend to obstruct Japan from carrying out the war against Britain and the United States. Although human beings create objective facts through their behavior, once objective facts are formed, those objective facts in turn dominate human behavior. The Greater East Asia War is an objective existence independent of the will of the belligerent countries, and has already constituted an irresistible force. Unilateral human will has no place in it. The objective situation that has developed in the course of this Greater East Asia War has prompted Japan to feel the need for the sincere cooperation of the Chinese people. However, the method of "winning the hearts of the Chinese people by force" has become a necessary condition for Japan to not be able to carry out the Greater East Asia War. Thus, the Chinese people's long-standing fear of Japan can be completely satisfactorily resolved based on this international situation. If, on the contrary, based on this international situation, the conclusion is reached that they must be able to join hands with Britain and the United States and try to obstruct Japan from building Greater East Asia, then such people are influenced by some preconceived notions.</p>
<p>(3) The preconceived notions truly held by a part of the Chinese people were laid by a series of unfortunate incidents such as the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, and the August 13th Incident. This concept is very deeply rooted. If anyone slightly violates their concept, the intensity of their anger is such that they often bring out three generations of ancestors to curse endlessly. Because I published an essay in the Shen Bao, I was scolded by readers. Someone said, "You don't look at the reality of Sino-Japanese relations, but only discuss ideal Sino-Japanese relations, which objectively protects Japan's position since the September 18th Incident." Others said, "Isn't the current Japanese targetting the third type of pro-Japanese faction? Since you protect the existing Sino-Japanese cooperation, then you are protecting the second type of pro-Japanese faction." Now, I'm sorry to the reader that I don't have time to answer them one by one, but I only have one counter-question, that is, if we only circle around the issue of who owns the two provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, what kind of rational peace solution can there be between Germany and France?" If we only settle old scores and talk about past facts, the result is that the only way to solve the problem is to resort to force. If we discuss the Sino-Japanese problem from this standpoint, then the conclusion will be: it is better for us to resort to other more appropriate methods than to resort to articles for discussion, so the two major ethnic groups will not stop fighting until they are both destroyed. If not, and we want to obtain some kind of rational peace solution (such as not wanting the cultures of China and Japan to perish like the Aztec culture), then we should not look for it in historical hatred, but in the necessity arising from the status quo. Moreover, if we do not simply study the continuous unfortunate incidents from the September 18th Incident to today itself, then we must examine it in the international situation in which it occurred. Most Japanese people believe in what former Prime Minister Konoe said: "The Sino-Japanese dispute is an abnormal East Asian civil strife that occurred under the heavy pressure of the old world system. To resolve it, there is hope only by swiftly and decisively cutting off the contradictions built on the foundation of the old world order." Therefore, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the heavy pressure of overthrowing the old British and American system created the objective situation for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute today.</p>
<p>When a nation with strong development power encounters obstacles to its development, it is bound to erupt in some way if it cannot adjust its development power. Those who deny the inevitability of this eruption also deny the development power of that nation. The world creates the inevitability of Japan's eruption on the one hand, and criticizes this eruption on the other hand. This is as unreasonable as a husband criticizing his wife, "Prices are so high, why do you want to have children?" It would be strange if China had the same development potential as Japan, and there was no conflict between China and Japan. Regarding the cause of the conflict between China and Japan, if we do not think about its inevitability with each other, but only say "I am long" and "you are short" and attack each other's behavior, then the conflict between China and Japan can never be resolved. As long as the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan are in the same stage of development, I call those who believe that this struggle will never end as the Sino-Japanese permanent struggle theorists. In fact, most of those who refute me unconsciously fall into the standpoint of this "Sino-Japanese permanent struggle theorist."</p>
<p>At the same time, Japanese who only recognize the development of the Japanese nation and deny the development of the Chinese nation also unconsciously fall into the standpoint of the "Sino-Japanese permanent struggle theorist." These two standpoints are both standpoints that hinder the resolution of the Sino-Japanese Incident. On the contrary, if we jointly recognize the development of the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan, and then estimate how to adjust this development, how not to make this narrow nationalism development of the two countries oppose each other, and guide it to external development, we can discover a reasonable and peaceful solution to the Sino-Japanese Incident.</p>
<p>Due to the new "January 28th Incident" in East Asia, Japan has overthrown the power of external forces that instigated the development forces of the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan to conflict with each other. Now, the development forces of the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan can develop outwards hand in hand. In the Colosseum in Rome, African and Syrian prisoners captured by the Romans fought each other for the Roman citizens to enjoy. The Chinese and Japanese people, because they are colored people, have been boycotted by Australia and expelled by the United States, and they have been fighting each other endlessly in the confines of East Asia. This scene is exactly the same as the fight in the Roman Colosseum for the enjoyment of Britain and the United States. The Africans and Syrians who fought in the Colosseum hated each other and killed each other to the last person, thus satisfying the eyes of the Roman citizens. If the people of China and Japan kill each other to the last person because of mutual hatred, those who are as happy as the Roman citizens will of course be Britain and the United States. The new objective situation formed by the Greater East Asia War has destroyed the Colosseum surrounding the people of China and Japan. Now is the time for the people of China and Japan to demand that the visitors pay a considerable admission fee. May 29, 32nd year (Translated by Rong)</p>

<p>The China United Publishing Co., Ltd., jointly prepared by Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, World Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, and Datong Book Company, has been ready since its preparation began. A tea party was held at the Hua Mao Hotel on the 8th floor yesterday (1st) at 3:30 PM to entertain people from all walks of life. In addition to Cao Bingyan, the manager of the company, and Bao Qinglin, Wu Shutong, Lu Gaoyi, Zhang Xichen, Jiang Xiling, and Jiang Junyi, the managers of the Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, World Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, and Datong Book Company, respectively, government officials and guests attending the meeting included Zhao Zunyue, Secretary-General representing Mayor Chen, Zhao Runfeng, Secretary representing Minister Li of the Ministry of Education, Feng Wei, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department, Lin Tong'an, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, and guests Zhao Zhengping, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Huang Jingwan, Shen Ziliang, Shen Zhong'an, Ku Jiancheng, Zhao Puxianqing, and Gu Yueran.

The tea party started at 3:30 PM, and Wu Shutong first chaired the meeting and gave an opening speech.</p>
<p>Wu Shutong's Opening Speech</p>
<p>In brief, he said: "Shanghai is the center of culture in the country. In recent years, due to various reasons, the atmosphere in the cultural circles has been very quiet, and the decline of the publishing industry has been particularly significant. Under the urging of public opinion and the expectations of all parties, we have the organization of this company. Therefore, although this company is a purely commercial institution, the scope of funding belongs to the publishing industry, which is slightly different from general commercial institutions, and is a cultural commercial institution. Since the outbreak of the war, the disaster of war has inevitably caused temporary damage and cessation to cultural and educational undertakings. The southeastern coastal area is centered on Shanghai. In the past five or six years, the losses in culture and education, whether tangible or intangible, have been great, without further ado. If it is not repaired urgently, it will be delayed day by day, and recovery will be more difficult, and its impact on the national livelihood will be profound and heavy. We believe that the revitalization of culture is important in peacetime, and its importance is even greater in wartime. It is necessary to increase military strength to seek the revival of the publishing industry, and to contribute to cultural education, to slightly make up for the shortcomings after the trauma of cultural undertakings, to directly serve the readers and the masses, and indirectly serve the country and the nation," and so on.</p>
<p>Speech by the Mayor's Representative</p>
<p>In brief, he said: "Shanghai has been affected by the war since the incident, and has declined slightly. But we do not abandon the cultural publishing industry because of the war. Cultural undertakings in wartime have different methods from peacetime. Due to wartime resources and talent relations, new methods must be used to operate in order to make the publishing industry develop. The opening of the China United Publishing Company today can be said to be a powerful organization that is suitable for the times and under the wartime system. In the future, the publishing industry in this city will definitely be able to revitalize and achieve greater progress," and so on.</p>
<p>Speech by the Representative of Minister Li</p>
<p>In brief, he said: "The relationship between the Ministry of Education and the publishing industry is very close. The Ministry of Education has the mission of developing culture in national administration, and the publishing industry has the function of promoting culture in group undertakings. The Ministry believes that if we want to develop Chinese culture, we must first make the publishing industry have a sound organization and smooth progress. Therefore, the Ministry's past and future attitude is consistent in doing its best to promote and support its development for the publishing industry. I take this opportunity to participate in this grand opening ceremony to respectfully wish the company's business and Chinese culture a prosperous future and reach a bright and splendid state," and so on.</p>
<p>Speech by Minister Okazaki</p>
<p>Speech by General Affairs Minister Okazaki representing Minister Tajiri: "Today, the establishment of the China United Publishing Company, in the eyes of the Japanese, the most gratifying is Minister Tajiri, but he was unable to participate due to public affairs in Tokyo. The publishing industry is not culture itself, but without the publishing industry, culture cannot develop. Therefore, the publishing industry is important for cultural relations. The Japanese admire the 5,000-year-old cultural development of China the most. All students entering middle school must learn Chinese, so studying ancient Chinese culture is the most common and enthusiastic phenomenon in Japan, which is even more important than learning European and American culture. However, few people pay attention to modern Chinese culture. From a personal point of view, the relationship between China and Japan is close, and we should study it enthusiastically. If Chinese and Japanese cultures can communicate, we can talk about the new combination of the two countries. The exchanges between the people of China and Japan have already begun. Although there are occasional setbacks, the relationship between the two countries is closer than that of any other country, which is self-evident. Sun Yat-sen's legacy has already understood that the unity of the East Asian nation is the most urgent and necessary. Now, the major book companies in China have formed the China United Publishing Company, which has great hope for the promotion of Chinese new culture in the future, and it is indeed worthy of congratulations. I especially hope that your company will not only promote the inherent culture of China, but also introduce more Japanese culture."</p>
<p>Speech by Director Feng</p>
<p>In the past six months, there have been two major events in Shanghai's cultural circles. One is the establishment of the New United Association a few months ago, and the other is the establishment of the National United Publishing Company today. Zeng Jun New United was established when he said that the establishment of the News United Association had launched a huge bomb against Britain and the United States. Now that your company has been established, it is shipping a large amount of food from Nanyang. Regardless of Chinese and Japanese people, they are eagerly anticipating spiritual food. Now that your company has been established, it cannot obtain a large amount of rice and coal, because material food and spiritual food are equally important. In the future, spiritual food can be resolved, so the benevolence is very important. The cultural development of each place can show the cultural progress of that place. Under the rule of the National Government, the cultural work in the peaceful areas is being vigorously revived. The establishment of your company this time is the result of your hard work, and you have also received great help from the great country. The hard work you have gained will surely be promoted and developed. I sincerely wish your company a prosperous future.</p>
<p>Speech by Wen Lantting</p>
<p>In brief, he said: "During the recent war period, the cultural trend in China has inevitably declined and stagnated. Due to the poor economic situation, most people have been oppressed by the sharp rise in prices. They are struggling in hunger and cold and cannot enjoy a pure cultural life. If we want to get rid of this bad environment of material domination, on the one hand, the people must have their own awareness and self-understanding, and on the other hand, there must be an institution engaged in cultural undertakings that strives to advocate and promote. The establishment of the China United Publishing Company is to meet this need. I deeply hope that all colleagues of the China United Publishing Company can clearly recognize this point," and so on.</p>
<p>Speech by President Yamamoto of Nippon Kaizo Sha</p>
<p>The nation's material is feared to be hoarded, but the more culture is hoarded, the better. The current war does not only rely on weapons. Political culture is equally important. He also stated that due to transportation relations in Japan, the publishing industry is restricted by paper, and the length of the book is reduced. He hopes that the Chinese publishing industry will use paper in practice and make more cultural propaganda that is beneficial to East Asia, and so on.</p>

<p>A notice from the Postal Administration states that, effective immediately, for all commodity parcels and small postal items sent from Shanghai to North China, South China (Guangdong Shantou Xiamen), and the Hankou area (Hankou Nanchang Jiujiang), if the contents include the following 25 types of goods, a permit from the local responsible government office at the destination and a removal approval certificate from the National Business Compilation General Association must be presented when submitting the items for mailing. Only then will the Bureau accept them. For genuine personal parcels and small postal items, a permit may not be required when submitting them, but the sender will be solely responsible. This is to notify everyone urgently. The list is as follows: (1) All kinds of automobiles and their parts, (2) Gasoline and petroleum products, (3) All kinds of machinery and their parts, (4) Communication equipment materials (including parts) and batteries, (5) Metals (including raw materials, non-ferrous metals, and their products, as well as silver dollars), (6) Medicines (for medical and industrial use, excluding Chinese medicine), dyes, and paints, (7) Rubber (including old rubber) and its products, (8) Timber (logs), (9) Broken materials and cement, (10) Wheat, wheat flour, sorghum flour, corn flour, beans, and other grains, bran and other feed, vegetable oil raw materials, and vegetable oilseed cakes, (11) Animal oils and fats, (12) Sugar and its products, (13) Cotton (including waste cotton and batting), (14) Wool, (15) Leather and fur, (16) Tobacco, (17) Cooking oil, (18) Sugar, (19) Cotton yarn, cloth, and their products, (20) Wax (including raw materials), (21) Matches, (22) Soap, (23) Paper (excluding joss paper), (24) Cigarettes, (25) Grass bags.</p>

<p>Since the National Government started the Clearing Villages campaign, the area has gradually expanded, and the tasks have become increasingly complex. The original Clearing Villages Committee was no longer adequate to meet the needs. Therefore, it was resolved at the 15th Supreme National Defense Conference on the 20th of last month to abolish the original Clearing Villages Committee. All Clearing Villages affairs will be transferred to a new organization established by the Executive Yuan to lead and handle. At the same time, the National Government issued an order to abolish the Clearing Villages Committee, and all Clearing Villages affairs in various provinces and cities will be the responsibility of the respective provincial and municipal governments to ensure clear systems and unified institutions to increase effectiveness. After Mayor Chen received the order, he discussed with senior personnel under his command the matter of ending the Shanghai Clearing Villages Branch and establishing the Shanghai Special Municipality Clearing Villages Affairs Bureau under the City Government. It is now heard that the bureau is reorganized from the Shanghai Clearing Villages Branch, and there will be no significant changes in internal organization and personnel to continue to promote the Clearing Villages work. Preparations are currently underway, and the formal establishment will be announced soon.</p>

<p>Watching a Ball Game Leads to Murder: Yi and Ren Meng Youcai, 32 years old this year, ran a second-hand goods business in Shanghai. He lived with his wife, Ms. Ru, at 156 Rue Amiral Courbet. At 3 PM on the 26th of last month, he went to the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge to watch a member ball game. Unexpectedly, a young man named Liang Chun accused him of stealing a car velvet coat and reported it to the association staff. He was detained in the staff room on the third floor. When they planned to report him to the police, Meng, in desperation, jumped out of the window to escape, resulting in a broken left arm and left leg. The police station was notified and sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died the next day. The body was taken to the coroner's office. It is now learned that the deceased's wife, because her husband died tragically and unnaturally, has hired a lawyer to negotiate.</p>
<p>Classmate Stabbed to Death: Jin Weigang, a local, was 16 years old and studied at Yucaigong School on Shanhai Pass Road. He had a classmate, Jiang Xingyuan, who had previously lived in Jin's home for a period of time, and their relationship was excellent. Yesterday morning, Jiang Xingyuan suddenly broke into Jin's house, took out a sharp blade, and stabbed Jin in the head, chest, and back three times. Family members arrived and reported to the police, who arrested the murderer. Jin Weigang died from his serious injuries. The police station is investigating the reason for the murder.</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper was sent out at 7:00 PM sharp.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Thoroughly Relieving the Disaster in North China <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Kurimoto Inji</p>
<p>On the 17th, 19th, and 20th of last month, the Shen Bao published three editorials, loudly appealing for the urgent relief of North China. Titled "Pleading for the People of North China," "Reiterating the Appeal for the Disaster in North China," and "North China Relief Cannot Be Delayed," these lengthy articles, totaling several thousand words, spared no details in explaining the dire situation. Due to years of drought, the provinces of Shandong and Henan have suffered poor harvests, especially the great famine of last year, causing unspeakable suffering to the people. The articles described the pressing circumstances and the severity of the suffering in a very tragic and moving way, strongly emphasizing the urgency and the need for immediate relief. I have also received reports from my company's overseas staff, learning about the tragic situation of the people in North China due to last year's great famine. It is said that in some places, displaced people, unable to find food, have exhausted the grass roots and tree bark, even devouring them to temporarily alleviate their hunger. What a tragic and heartbreaking message this is.</p>
<p>The urgency of relieving the disaster victims is not only felt by the Shen Bao, but who in all of China is not anxious? Everyone hopes that this urgent relief effort will be launched even faster than the ambulances in Shanghai. Who does not have a warm love for their compatriots? Not only are the Chinese people like this, but the people of neighboring Japan should also participate in this urgent relief effort. Unfortunately, my country is currently dedicating its national strength to defeating Britain and the United States, so although it has unlimited sympathy for this disaster in China, it cannot directly provide relief. This is the unfortunate reality. Therefore, I, a Japanese resident in China, while fulfilling my duties in serving the home front, cannot but offer my prayers to the disaster victims of our friendly neighbor, China. Although China is known for its vast land and abundant resources, when considering China's population and its production, it is not necessarily possible to affirm the abundance of resources. Although China is vast, there are natural and man-made disasters large and small every year. Among the large and small disasters suffered throughout the year, some could have been prevented by human effort beforehand. However, considering China's current intellect and social organization, it is probably not easy to do so. Therefore, from a more passive perspective, one should consider establishing a permanent relief agency, and this kind of facility is also a political topic for a new China. The annual harvests have been poor, and last year's disaster was particularly severe. Therefore, this is not today's disaster, but there were signs of today's famine half a year ago or even earlier. However, due to the lack of a relief agency, today's tragedy has been created. Now that things have come to this point, loudly appealing for disaster relief, even if the words are not false, I am afraid that the result will still be far from effective.</p>
<p>In past years, when disasters, both natural and man-made, occurred in Central and North China, the people mostly found ways to dredge the urgent relief supplies needed, taking emergency measures. Although disasters could not be completely avoided, most of them could be saved in advance. However, the current economic situation under wartime has impeded the free exchange of goods between North and Central China due to its uncertainty. This is an unavoidable situation, but restrictions on currency circulation and the movement of goods, especially the difficulty of food exchange, have undoubtedly exacerbated the extent of the disaster. It is undeniable that dredging food to North China and promoting relief efforts together will surely make this relief effort more effective.</p>
<p>However, China is vast, and one cannot say for sure where disasters will occur in a year. Although today's emergency in North China has been saved, one cannot guarantee that disasters will not occur elsewhere tomorrow. Having thought of the drought in North China, one should also consider the floods in Central China in advance. Therefore, taking advantage of this drought in North China, the Nanjing Central Government must study irrigation and flood control measures to the extent that human resources can reach, and actively prevent disasters. On the one hand, a permanent relief agency should be established, with large-scale fundraising, and at the same time, relief bonds or relief lottery tickets should be issued, using various methods to ensure sufficient relief funds so that they can be readily allocated in case of an emergency. From the perspective of China's current national situation, this is an appropriate method and worthy of promotion. Here, let me say something else. In the past, China often had official and private fundraising events, but very few of the relief efforts actually benefited the true victims. Most of them were pocketed halfway through, silently and quietly. How regrettable this is. Thinking of danger in times of peace, so I think of this situation, and I hope that this point will not be seen again today. Accumulating grain to prevent famine is also a necessary mentality for stable living. (Yunpeng: Translated from the May 31st edition of the Mainland New Daily)</p>
<h3 id="e36">Obligations of Neighboring People <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the citizens of Shanghai have been loudly appealing for urgent relief for the disaster in North China, which is worth noting. The Nanjing National Government has also taken the lead and adopted active countermeasures. At this time and place, how can we Japanese residents in China sit idly by and watch the tragic suffering of our neighbors?</p>
<p>...We are now fighting with everything we have for the survival of our motherland. Even the smallest material and strength cannot be overlooked and must be mobilized to achieve the war's objectives. With this in mind, should we just say a few nice words to the countless disaster victims in North China and not think of any concrete relief measures? No, absolutely not. We must find a way to help. We are not paupers without any means. We should contribute what we can.</p>
<p>!...The famine in North China is not a new problem. The province with the most severe famine, Henan, still has some areas under Chongqing's jurisdiction. Therefore, Chongqing has long been preparing for a relief campaign, and it is said that the United States is also launching a similar campaign. In fact, the United States does not have pity or humanitarianism in mind but is using this as a way to win over Chongqing, which is not a relief effort at all.</p>
<p>...Chongqing and the United States have already done this kind of work, but as long as we do this kind of relief work with sincerity, it doesn't matter who does it first or last. It's not too late to start now. The actual amount of relief supplies is not the only issue. The real starting point is to treat the suffering of the disaster victims as our own suffering, and we must also bear in mind that their lives today determine their fate tomorrow.</p>
<p>...The Chinese citizens of Shanghai are greatly concerned about this issue. This is naturally human nature, but seeing the difficulties of today's living environment in Shanghai, they are willing to raise funds and collect materials to help their compatriots, which reveals a very deep meaning. Originally, Shanghainese were accused of being cold-blooded people who had lost their nationality, but now, this enthusiastic relief campaign, willing to endure hardship themselves to help others, is a sincere expression of protest against this accusation. We should also strive to work together in a life-and-death relationship! (Yunpeng: Translated from the May 30th edition of the Mainland New Daily editorial)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Economic News: Translated Report on the Recent Work Goals of the Business Coordination Committee <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Since its transfer to the Executive Yuan on May 20th, the Business Coordination Committee has been actively promoting the organization of lower-level institutions, which is scheduled to be completed around June 15th. It has also established professional committees for various material supreme control departments. Some have been established, and others are still in preparation. The foundation for the future development of work has also been established, and it will surely be able to conduct healthy activities in the future. The recent work goals of the committee are generally as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Policy on Establishing Associations: The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Food have decided to establish 22 associations, but whether the Business Coordination Committee, after its transfer to the Executive Yuan, will inherit the previously decided policy is currently undecided and under study. However, the result may be to establish some important associations first.</p>
<p>(2) Guidance and Compilation of Professional Committees: Professional committees have been decided to establish the Flour and Wheat Committee, the Sugar Industry Committee, the Cotton Industry Committee, and the Oil and Grain Committee. The first two have already been established, and the latter two will also be established soon. It is also heard that the Board of Directors and Supervisors also have this intention, believing that, when necessary, in addition to the above-mentioned professional committees, some other professional committees may also be established, but the details have not yet been fully decided. Professional committees should be guided and supervised by the Board of Directors. Their members are also appointed and dismissed by the Board of Directors and Supervisors. For example, the chairman of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee is also planned to be held by Jiang Shangda, a director of the Business Coordination Committee, which shows that there is no separation between the Board of Directors and Supervisors and the Professional Committees.</p>
<p>(3) Election of Directors and Supervisors: Since the Business Coordination Committee is an autonomous organization, its directors and supervisors are naturally elected by the people. However, the election should first expand and establish the trade associations and their alliances as autonomous organizations and then select representatives from the lower-level institutions to decide. Now that the lower-level institutions have not yet been fully established, there is no way to elect directors and supervisors.</p>
<p>Some people believe that the figures on the Board of Directors and Supervisors are only representatives of the Shanghai financial community and lack a national character. However, the leaders of the Shanghai financial community are also the controllers of the local financial community. Therefore, it is possible to integrate the characteristics of Shanghai representatives and the characteristics of local representatives. This point is not a major problem.</p>
<p>(4) Establishment of Planning and Research Institutions: In order to comprehensively develop the work of the Business Coordination Committee, some people within the committee also advocate establishing a comprehensive planning and research institution directly under the Business Coordination Committee. Although this opinion is quite strong, it has not yet been fully concretized. It is believed that with the progress of the military organization work, an authoritative institution will be established to expand the work goals of solely seeking the interests of the Chinese and Japanese business communities and further take on the important task of planning and controlling the economy.

<h3 id="e38">Interbank Exchange Balance Transfer in Cash Taken Over by Central Reserve Bank Yesterday; Head Office Overdrafts Still Handled by Silver Union Preparatory Committee <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank yesterday took over the interbank exchange balance transfer matters of the note exchange of the Commerce Bank Industry United Preparatory Committee. Cash overdrafts of the committee will be handled by the Central Reserve Bank. Head office overdrafts will continue to be handled, but this is already a tight squeeze. It has been learned that the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has discussed the transfer of cash interbank exchange balances with the Bank Industry United Preparatory Committee and the Bankers Association, and opinions have long been agreed. Therefore, it was decided to implement it starting on June 1st. It is reported that various banks previously had considerable deposits with the Silver Union Preparatory Committee. Now all the cash deposit portions have been deposited with the Central Reserve Bank, and the head office deposits are still deposited with the Silver Union Preparatory Committee. Therefore, it is appropriate for the Central Reserve Bank to take over the transfer of the cash note exchange balance portion of the interbank exchange. As for the transfer of the remittance balance portion, due to technical reasons, it will probably still be handled by the Silver Union Preparatory Committee. The relevant parties are actively studying the above specific measures.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Bankers Association to Discuss Underwriting Food Warehouse Vouchers <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the financial community, the Central Reserve Bank has specially promoted the transfer of the type A grain vouchers it has underwritten to banks, money houses, trust companies, and private individuals. A few days ago, Qian Daqian, deputy governor of the Central Reserve Bank, convened responsible persons from the Shanghai silver and money industries to explain the significance of this transfer and underwriting of type A grain vouchers. As a result, all the silver and money houses expressed their approval. As for the allocation of the amount of grain vouchers that each silver and money house will underwrite, it is heard that the Bankers Association will convene a standing committee meeting on Wednesday, the 3rd of this week, to discuss and decide.</p>

<p>Since the Central Savings Society was relieved of military management on February 15th of this year and the National Government's Ministry of Finance entrusted the Central Reserve Bank to raise funds, inherit the management, and continue operations, its business has increased significantly compared to before. Now, in order to encourage people from all over the country to save, the society has decided to restore the business of its branches in various places before the incident and formally establish branches in Wuxi, Suzhou, Changshu, Yangzhou, Jiaxing, Taixian, Jiaohu, Bengbu, Wujiang, and nine other places. The branches and agencies in various places that are currently actively preparing include Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Kunshan, Changzhou, Jiading, Taicang, Hankou, Jiujiang, Anqing, Dangtu, Jiangyin, Hangzhou, Xiashi, Tongxiang, Jiashan, Songjiang, Huzhou, Pinghu, Ningbo, Rufou, Jiancheng, Funing, Liuhe, Pudong, and twenty-eight other places, which will be ready in the shortest possible time and announce their opening.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce West Shanghai Office has largely completed the industrial and commercial survey work in the area. It is learned that the office is now actively conducting industrial and commercial surveys in the Xujiahui and Zhoujiaqiao districts and is currently preparing to establish (1) a business group, (2) a factory group, and (3) a financial group to engage in liaison with various industries, thereby promoting business.

<h3 id="e43">Regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Materials Control Bureau: Methods for Transporting Yarn and Cloth to Outside the Concession; Must Be Stamped by the West Shanghai District Office <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The transport of cotton yarn and cloth in this city must go to the yarn and cloth section of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Materials Control Bureau to obtain a transport permit before transport is allowed. However, this transport permit is only limited to the Public Concession and the French Concession and is not valid outside the two concession areas, making it difficult for textile factories opened in West Shanghai and other places outside the concession to transport the yarn and cloth stored in the concession area to outside the concession. It was learned yesterday that the bureau has already stipulated that all yarn and cloth goods, such as applications for moving out of the concession or into the concession from outside the concession, must be stamped by the West Shanghai District Office before they can be used. The address of the West Shanghai District Office is at the intersection of Avenue Haig and Avenue du Colonel Fieschi.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Government Bonds: This morning, the unofficial market for unified government bonds was slightly firmer, and market fluctuations were also minor. Type A, Type B, Type C, Type D, and Type E were all flat, and transactions were light.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver: This morning, the price of gold jewelry at various gold shops in the city was still exchanged at the limited price. The price of internal and external transactions rose slightly, but fell back at noon, rising tens of yuan compared to yesterday. Transactions were not strong. The transaction price of decorated silver was slightly higher at the border.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: Cotton yarn was flat and weak due to tight money, with some people wanting to sell, but buyers had no interest. The cotton cloth market continued the previous day's rise, showing a rising trend. The trend was still firm after the initial opening, but the market sentiment became slightly tired due to more selling. As a result, it closed slightly higher. Longtou silk was fine and the trend was quite good. Sijunzi serge and White Cat calico both rose slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Trends in Chinese Stocks <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were firm first and then weak, ultimately showing little change from the previous day. This was because the fifth lunar month had just passed, the approaching Dragon Boat Festival, and the tightness of money, making it difficult for investors to muster strength. The mood of all parties was confused. Nanyang Tobacco Company continued to advance rapidly under the search of buyers, continuing the rising momentum of the past two days. Great China Matches fell by a little over one yuan. The transaction volume of New Pharmaceuticals was the highest among all stocks. Sino-French Pharmacy fell slightly. New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory was stable. Sin Yee was firm. In the department store industry, Sincere still stood at the border, Wing On was slightly lower, and Chinese Goods fell by nearly one yuan. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile rose slightly, Meiya Silk Factory fell slightly, Innerwear returned slightly, and Jingfu Shirts and Socks continued to rise steadily in the buying trend. Small-cap textile stocks such as Zhenzhong Weaving and Dyeing, Great Light, Xinfeng, and Xinfu were all firm. The market price of the public utilities industry was weak. The market price of Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Merchants Gas was declining steadily. In the cultural industry, China Bookstore broke into the border. Buyers of Commercial Press rose and became active again, with a good momentum. Tongyi Trust's supply and demand were evenly matched. Jiuan Industrial and Xinyi Real Estate fell. Zhongxing Wood Industry had people searching for it. All other stocks were flat.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Dynamics of Various Trade Unions <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>

<p>The Silk Industry Trade Union Federation was established on the 31st of last month, passing the charter and stipulating that all trade unions belonging to the cocoon industry, silk factory industry, silk shop industry, silk weaving factory industry, and silk and satin shop industry should join the federation as members.

<p>— Lin Ying</p>
<p>Calling out: Three years of separation, I never thought you would change to such an extent. A passionate and lively young man, fallen into such a pessimistic, passive, gloomy, and depressed state, and finally succumbing to the demon of illness. Feverish flushes, coughing up blood, tossing and turning in bed, abandoning all hope. Alas! The grind of life, the oppression of economics, is so cruel!</p>
<p>I have not yet seen you once, but I can imagine your pale face and thin body. From your handwriting, from your words, I have already depicted your recent image. The photo from the academic ceremony is still hanging on the wall. You are standing in the center, with those full cheeks and bright eyes, which can't help but make me feel sad and hurt again.</p>
<p>I don't have the courage to encourage you, and I don't want to comfort you with false words. I also have no power to help you. You may blame me, hate me, why a close friend is so indifferent. Yes, this is my sin. Passionate friendship can no longer warm your cold heart. I sympathize with you, infinitely sympathize, but what good is it to you? You are a victim. A victim of this unreasonable social organization, this unsuitable education system. I curse, I want to overthrow, I plan to transform, but... That's why I say I don't have the courage to encourage you, I don't want to comfort you with false words, and I have no power to help you.</p>
<p>You use alcohol to stimulate your nerves, and you want to jump into the river to end your miserable life. You have gone to the end, and perhaps there is no way to save you. On Sunday, I will definitely come to see you. When I see your face, I will cry bitterly to you. I had the most hope for you, but the most hopeful person is now gone. How can it not be heartbreaking? However, even in despair, I still hold hope, hoping that many young people who are following in your footsteps and are walking on your path can be saved. Alas! You have sacrificed, I will heartlessly say one sentence, you will soon leave this world. At that time, I will lay your body across the entrance of the road you are walking, as a warning monument. On the one hand, let those who are still approaching take a deep awakening; on the other hand, let those who lead the way deeply realize that there is a need to change direction. In this way, you should be willing, right! Goodbye. Ji Shang.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Getting Vaccinated <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Li</p>
<p>The weather is getting hotter, and vaccinations have already begun. Generally, those who consider themselves "upper class" seem to find it very troublesome. They think this is applied to the "lower class," and it is a superfluous matter for the "upper class." However, the authorities stipulate that they must search every household, and if there is no vaccination certificate, they will be forced to get vaccinated and will not be allowed to pass on the road. Therefore, they "plan ahead" and try to get "one." They think that only in this way are they worthy of being called the "upper class" and worthy of "face." In fact, this is exactly showing their lack of common sense.</p>
<p>It must be known that getting vaccinated is not a matter of "showing off," but is related to public health. It is a task within the scope of public health. Although, on the surface, whether you get vaccinated or not has nothing to do with others, in fact, if you avoid it and I avoid it, then the "epidemic" will definitely not be "prevented," and the result will be an outbreak, and the harm will not only be to individuals. Last summer's terrible outbreak of plague must still be fresh in our memories! Therefore, I hope that the above-mentioned clever methods of evasion will not happen again in the future. Getting vaccinated is the real "planning ahead"! I hope everyone will go and get vaccinated as soon as possible, especially hoping that the principals, teachers, factories, and store managers of schools, senior combatants, and the heads of each household will take the lead in getting vaccinated as an example for students, employees, and children.</p>

<p>— Oshita Udaer</p>
<p>(IX) The Joy of Rest</p>
<p>People in the modern world often complain about unbearable busyness and overwhelming lack of time, but in naval schools or on warships, no one is heard saying such things.</p>
<p>However, this busyness is even more intense during combat, but there are exceptions. During this combat, there are two types of people who, due to having no opportunity to be heroic, obtain free time and retire. They retire from the bridge to the officers' room, completely different from other crew members who are doing their duties as if crazy.</p>
<p>One is the chief medical officer.</p>
<p>The sound of naval guns booms, raising water columns more than ten feet high. A fierce battle is in progress. At this time, the chief medical officer retires due to being free, which indicates that there are very few injured comrades. So this retirement is actually very welcome.</p>
<p>The second is the artillery officer of the aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>The aircraft carrier launches aircraft from its deck to attack the enemy at a great distance. From its performance point of view, if the aircraft carrier's actions are appropriate and effective, then the artillery officer is useless. If it directly fires on enemy ships or is attacked by enemy aircraft, then the artillery officer will be extremely busy. However, this is not a good phenomenon. Usually, the artillery officer is very idle, stroking the gun barrel, waiting for friendly aircraft to return successfully.</p>
<p>In addition to the chief medical officer and the artillery officer of the aircraft carrier, it is also good if the aircraft maintenance personnel, etc., have free time during combat. Before the aircraft departs, the maintenance personnel adjust the engine. It is rare not to be busy with repairs. The maintenance personnel are different from the chief medical officer. Even if there are no repairs, there are still various tasks. If there is no damage or breakage due to being hit by enemy bullets, thus requiring no repairs, isn't this obviously a welcome phenomenon?</p>
<p>(X) The Habit of Darkness</p>
<p>During blackout exercises for air defense training, clothing is finished in the dark. It is very difficult to monitor the weather within the jurisdiction. I wrote a letter to a certain second-class maintenance petty officer I knew, saying in the letter:</p>
<p>"But it will eventually become a habit. After getting used to it, even in the dark, you can do quite a lot of things. So I often have to do that."</p>
<p>Details are unknown, but it probably happened at a certain air base. Not limited to naval aircraft, but also army aircraft! The aircraft returning from attacking the enemy are considerably damaged in order to "break through the barrage like a rainstorm." Therefore, they must be repaired day and night, but the enemy also targets the base for bombing, so night must be very careful. In complete blackouts, maintenance personnel often grope in the dark, engaged in repairs, not neglecting or omitting a single screw or nail. Thinking that these aircraft are used to attack the enemy, even in that darkness, they concentrate and complete the perfect repair immediately. (Note: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<p>— Written by Navy Reporter Hamaoto Hiroshi</p>
<p>9.  Seven-Boat Tactics</p>
<p>The captain leaned on the railing of the flag deck connecting to the bridge and continued to speak.</p>
<p>"Speaking of the examples of the Solomon Sea battle. You may know that surprise attacks are simply our navy's forte. At that time, the seven boats hidden to stab the enemy's throat were the torpedo units. Braving the hail of bullets, passing through the angry waves and turbulent seas, charging towards the enemy's main force, giving the enemy a fatal blow, were our torpedo units. But our boats never thought of defense. Therefore, the suicidal tactics must be carried out with the belief that one shot will definitely hit. This is the spirit of the Japanese traditional chivalrous person."</p>
<p>In this respect, the captain, the torpedo unit, and Shimizu Ketsuya linked together.</p>
<p>"Since I was a child, I have liked the life of a chivalrous person. The so-called spirit of a chivalrous person is by no means the frivolous thing that the world spreads. It must be a life of self-restraint and thorough selflessness. We also apply this spirit in our tactics. Selfless tactics--do you understand?"</p>
<p>"This is really hard to understand."</p>
<p>"When it gets dark, you will know, because we will definitely encounter the enemy." The captain made an appointment with him like this.</p>
<p>"But I learned one more thing from senior Shimizu." The captain continued to say,</p>
<p>"Senior Shimizu once said that if one's own sword is pierced by the enemy, one should take a short sword and stab forward. Do you know? If one's own firing range is very short, then one must charge forward to shoot. But when charging forward, do not show one's own weakness. While oppressing the enemy, charge forward. For this, you need faith and skill. Fortunately, my crew members have all had sufficient training. To apply this, you need the spirit of the commander. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>This is what everyone would think is right. However, whether it can be used in a real battle is what Edokoro felt uneasy about in his heart.</p>
<p>"You will know tomorrow. If you have made up your mind, everything will be no problem." The captain said "tomorrow" again.</p>
<p>That "tomorrow's" sky had not a single cloud since morning, only the northwest monsoon was whistling.</p>
<p>Since departing from the base port, the "Kurogane" has been constantly guarding against the enemy and escorting two transport ships.</p>
<p>The so-called escort is not a surprise attack with seven boats, nor a naval battle with hulls rubbing against each other. Dragging merchant ships, one must drive away planes and repel submarines while completing the mission. This is a truly dry and impossible operation, and it is also a difficult operation.</p>
<p>The boat continued to advance southward and had entered the enemy's air raid circle in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The artillery officer, who was going into battle for the first time, stood on the lookout platform above the awning. There were two lookouts on the left and right, holding binoculars, guarding in all directions.</p>
<p>The iron plate gradually heated up. The two eyes placed on the binoculars ached like needles.</p>
<p>Around 2:00 PM, a small island with coconut trees was seen on the starboard side. It seemed uninhabited.</p>
<p>Around 2:30 PM, the lookout on the bridge confirmed that it was a distant shadow of an enemy aircraft and immediately notified the lookout on the awning.</p>
<p>The lookout on the awning reported through binoculars: "Six B-17 aircraft are flying towards our boat in formation."</p>
<p>10.  The Battle</p>
<p>The enemy aircraft approached in the blink of an eye and lowered their altitude, separating into three groups on the left and right. A signalman ran onto the awning and used signal flags to order the merchant ships following behind to prepare to meet the enemy. The boat immediately went at full speed, and while tilting, rushed around the merchant ships. The waves and spray passing over the sides rose all the way to the awning.</p>
<p>The enemy aircraft lowered themselves over the fleet and dropped bombs.</p>
<p>"The three planes on the left have dropped bombs." Someone shouted loudly from the bridge. Black pillars of water suddenly rose between the merchant ships, and then fell down in piles.</p>
<p>The other three aircraft suddenly lowered and approached the boat's sky. The captain frequently ordered to turn the rudder, but did not issue an order to fire.</p>
<p>The shadow of the enemy aircraft suddenly passed over the sky with a roar, and the captain ordered to turn the rudder to chase the aircraft.</p>
<p>Edokoro was a little confused. So he asked through the voice tube: "Captain, should we fire?"</p>
<p>Suddenly, the window of the sky opened, and the captain's face was revealed.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," the captain said with a smile.</p>
<p>Edokoro followed the shadow of the enemy aircraft and walked behind. Suddenly, there was someone standing at the entrance of the engine room. He had spiral leggings wrapped from knee to ankle, a steel helmet on his head, and aimed his rifle at the sky. This was the vice-chief engineer, Komasei.</p>
<p>"Fool!"</p>
<p>The captain laughed loudly into the voice tube towards the upper deck. Komasei looked up at the bridge and didn't hear what was said.</p>
<p>Due to Komasei's strange behavior, the atmosphere on the bridge suddenly wavered, and immediately returned to the original tension.</p>
<p>Three enemy aircraft flew down towards the head of the boat. It wasn't that the enemy aircraft flew over, but that the boat was heading towards the enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>"Fire!"</p>
<p>This was the captain's voice. Edokoro then ordered: "Start firing!"</p>
<p>The turrets immediately spat out all at once. Machine guns also continued to fire incessantly. The entire boat shook violently due to the reaction.</p>
<p>One enemy aircraft suddenly spewed white smoke near the side, and soon turned into a large flame. The fire quickly expanded and became a fireball, but it fell to the sea surface unexpectedly slowly.</p>
<p>At that time, the boat was already 500 meters away from the crash site. The dazzling flames trembled on the sea surface, gradually turning into black smoke, which was torn into thin lines by the wind.</p>
<p>In the sky, two parachutes swayed. Those must have been the enemy pilots who escaped from the aircraft.</p>
<p>"Artillery officer! Look! That guy is hanging down."</p>
<p>Looking in the direction pointed by the lookout, one of the two aircraft that had flown past in the opposite direction of the boat had black smoke hanging on its tail and was slowly descending. Soon it touched the sea surface.</p>
<p>A signalman ran up, beckoning to the merchant ships that had already left far away.</p>
<p>"Captain! Let's recover the guys who parachuted down!"</p>
<p>Edokoro asked the captain this way. The captain showed his face again from the skylight, and said vigorously: "We have to hurry. Don't deal with these idiots, let the sand sharks entertain them!" Answering as if reciting lines. On the bridge, the voices of the officers became lively.</p>
<p>Edokoro also became excited, and imitated the captain's tone and said, "Let the sand sharks entertain them!"</p>
<p>The "Kurogane" sailed ahead, followed closely by two merchant ships. As if nothing had happened, they continued to head south. (Translated by Tao from Asahi Shimbun. The End)</p>

<p>(2) Mr. Ding Fubao expressed his opinions on the nutritional health of the elderly: Everyone hopes to live a long life. To achieve this goal is not difficult. The most important thing is to change the common misconceptions. Some people think that opening windows will cause colds and coughs; that eating meat and fish can make the body strong. In fact, these are very wrong. Opening windows can freshen the indoor air. After forming a habit, not only will you not catch a cold or cough, but your body will become stronger. Eating meat, such as beef, mutton, pork, crabs, and shrimp, can sometimes cause poisoning or raise blood pressure and harden blood vessels, which can shorten life. We often see some old people in the countryside who don't eat much fish or meat on weekdays, yet they enjoy long lives. This shows that a vegetarian diet is indeed beneficial. German leader Hitler and Indian saint Gandhi both advocated vegetarianism. Vegetables should not be cooked too thoroughly, as the vitamins will disappear. One should not eat too much, as eating too much is not only useless but harmful. The three meals a day may as well be changed to two meals. Fruits are of great value in terms of dietary hygiene, but apples and bananas are very expensive, so carrots and tomatoes can be used as substitutes, but they must be eaten raw. People with good teeth can chew them, and those with bad teeth can juice them and drink them. To live a long life, in addition to reforming the diet, a kind of meditation method is also very effective. Meditation can concentrate the mind on one point, which is what is said in our ancient books as "concentrating the spirit on the mysterious aperture." The effect is to double the mental energy for work and prolong life. Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang and I have both had long-term experience with meditation, and we deeply feel that meditation can indeed help a person's health and longevity. We dare to introduce it to people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Xu Zhuodai spoke in a humorous tone. Speaking of the "Elderly Sutra," I am sixty years old this year, but I don't know I'm old, and I don't admit I'm old. Most of my friends are young people, and only a few are old people. I feel like I am still young and do not know that old age is coming. Eight years ago, by chance, I bought a book called "Disease-Free Living After Forty," written by a Japanese medical doctor. After reading this book, I deeply felt that it is not easy to be an old person, and one must have common sense. For the past eight years, I have done what is mentioned in the book that I could do. This book is currently being translated, and the future title will be "Elderly Sutra."</p>
<p>The first section of this book says, why do people age? It mainly says that human aging is entirely due to the process of metabolism. The second section says that the so-called immortality and rejuvenation in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, are all fantasies of powerful emperors. In fact, they are all unattainable. The third section says that according to the latest scientific theories, with the help of endocrine glands (hormones), it is possible to maintain a certain degree of youth. The fourth section says that people over forty should pay attention to points such as (1) taking a nap after lunch every day to conserve energy, even five minutes is good, it is of great benefit to the body. (2) Often make friends with young men and women. (3) When you see white hair on your head, this is a natural physiological phenomenon, which is irrelevant and does not need to be worried about. (4) Pay attention to maintaining normal blood pressure and blood vessels, and do not allow blood pressure to rise or blood vessels to harden. (5) Food and drink must be kept normal and not excessive. In addition, there are also things about sexual life and so on.</p>
