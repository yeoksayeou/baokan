<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>戰時社會政策問題</h3>
<p>— 任遠</p>
<p>社會政策在平時是用以補救現代經濟制度之缺陷的政策，其目的在扶導社會，改造社會。雖然理論及政策的內容不盡相同，原則上大致不會懸殊太甚的。至於戰時，國民經濟不免遭遇劇烈的變化，社會及國民生活都要發生重耍的轉變，其間畸形現象與缺陷之發現，爲必不可免者，所以需要能適應戰時條件的社會政策，加以補救與扶導。當此世界大戰趨向決戰階段之際，各國社會政策，幾與軍事經濟同被重視，絕非偶然。八日申報所載「日本戰時的社會政策」一文可見一斑。</p>
<p>我國歷代政治家及其施政，對於庶民生活，向極重視，扶助指導，列爲政治要略。我國倫理，以「孝」爲第一義，以「家」爲社會基礎，以「五代同堂一的大家庭爲幸福之象徵，「瓜結緜緜」，成爲祝賀的成語、所以，無形中爲國家人口繁殖政策在民閒迭成一種發動力。現代日德的戰時社會政策，莫不置共重心於人口政策，即所謂人的資源之維持與培養，用種種方法以獎勵結婚與生育，以期達成其戰時國策。但在我國，實際上就不必向道一方面多所努力，我們今日的社會政策，人口對策方面，與其致力於增殖，不如硏究如何優生，即努力獎勵優秀國民之生殖，設法制止遺傳病者生育。在我國今日更感重要的是「人口的維持」，即對現有人口最低生活之維持·健康之保護·心身　動之指導等等。務使减少幼兒之夭折、產母之死亡，及降低一般國民的死亡率。據一般統計，中國人口的繁殖力不及歐美列强，但死亡率之高竟可與印度相比（印度爲世界死亡率最高之民族，但其繁殖率亦特强），而全國人民中，眞正健全者所佔人數更須以千分之幾或萬分之幾計算，所以中山先生早會大聲疾呼「中華民族滅亡之危機」。我們要在戰後與列强並立於世界，即當在此時加倍努力於人口維待政策，消滅人口不正常的死亡現象，消滅「遠東病夫國」的恥辱。</p>
<p>當代列强維持及培養人的資源政策，其重耍項目，大致爲：　國　最低限度生活之保障，及國民生活之改善；　社會保險制度之擴充；　勞工•職員及農業勞動者生活之保護；　醫療·衛生•保健設備之充實與普及：　國民社會敎育之推進及改良。爲了實現這些要求，政府有專門負責執行戰時社會政策的機構和專門人員，政府在預算中列入爲執行社會政策所必需的確定的經費，政府還設有一定的監察機構，同時與民意機關密切聯絡，使戰時社會政策不僅有煌煌的法令與機關，而且可以收穫眞實的效果，輔翼國家全部戰時政策，完成總力戰的體制。我們今日希望當局對這一方面，也能毫不輕忽，急起直追。</p>
<p>爲了保障戰時國民生活，並進而求其改善，日本除了保議母子，救護少年等的救護法，　災保護法，兒童虐待防制法之外，尙有司法保護，戰時災害保險制度，衣食及日用必需品充分配給制度等辦法，以安定國民生活。德國也有失業救濟，姙產婦之保護，乳兒養育之援助，母性保護及托兒所之普及等設施。此在我國，首須解決民食問題，使人人足食；然後再消除暴富極貧的現象，以改善國民戰時生活。其次，社會保險制度，在列强行之已久，最近社會福利部爲適應戰時特殊需要，舉辦勞動保險，似應迅爲推行。現在日本的社會保險制度，在戰時匕有長足發展，先後創設國民健康保險制度，職員健康保險制度，船員保險制度，勞工年金保險制度等等，成績卓著。德國則有疾病保險，傷害保險，年金保險，殘廢保險，事務員保險，鑛工保險等。總之，皆足以表現國家對於人民戰時及戰後生活之切實關心與保護，然後人民乃能自動起來爲國家效忠，否則，雖朝夕督責，臨之以重典，也是收效極微的。</p>
<p>在總力戰體制下，爲爭取最後勝利的決定力量，除了前綫將士以外，還依靠後方人民的協力，尤其是工農在生產部門的努力。因此，如何提高工農生產者的生產報國熱忱，實爲社會政策中心任務之一。</p>
<p>醫療，衛生和保健設備，在戰時更爲重要。以日本爲例，戰時指導國民保健的核心機關「保健所」，一九三八年計劃建設四十九所，但現在已有二百三十九所，今年底又將增設八十所，指導保健者也由四千人增至七千人。醫療方面，去年制定國民醫療法，設立日本醫療團，以六億圓爲事業基金，從事於結核病之預防及撲滅，凡醫療內容之提高，全國各地由都市至鄕村普遍設立國民醫療機構，日趨發達。我國當局在這一方面似應急起努力，維護民族健康。</p>
<p>最後，希望國民社會敎育之普遍推行，使普通國民對於戰爭，對於國家社會，都具備正確的認識，同時對於戰時生活之實踐，對於公共衛生之注重，對於社會服務之協力，對於公衆秩序之維護，都能因社會教育之普及而人人有自覺，人人能自助與自治。然後在國家統一的政策與法令之下，匯爲一種巨大的力量，如此，總力參戰纔有其實際的意義，而新中國與大東亞的建設，纔可獲得最可靠的保證。</p>

<h3>義國北部被控制德大軍進佔羅馬東南歐暨駐法義軍被繳械</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　德元首行營十日發表：已任命羅美爾元帥為義北德軍總司令，現義北之義軍向德已投降。</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　德政府十日以特別公報發表：德軍已將羅馬市完全佔領。</p>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社十日訊：德軍佔領羅馬前義軍司令官於九日與德軍開始交涉、十日下午接收德方條件成立協定，德軍不越過羅馬市非武裝地帶之境界綫，德軍佔據德大使館，義電台，及電話局。義將貝爾哥拉將軍現已被任命為羅馬警備司令、指揮武裝兵士一師團及警察隊，維持首都治安、容許各都大臣執行正常任務。</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　德軍已佔領熱諾亞（Genoa）及里維拉（Riviera），斯比西亞港，（Spezia）亦在德軍手中。</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電德元首行營發表特別公報稱、經短時間之爭鬥後、德軍已於星期五佔領羅馬，現正在進行解除義大利京城四周義軍之武裝。公報之本文如下：最近數星期‘叛逆之巴特里奧政府爲準備脫　計，早巳集中大軍於羅馬西周，並對駐於羅馬城外之德軍探取防禦措施，而以羅馬遭受敵軍在西部登陸之威脅爲遁詞、自義大利於九月八日傍晚降敵後，德軍與義軍即在羅馬四周發生戰爭、南部德軍總司令凱塞林元帥獲得援軍後，即向羅馬進攻、並向羅馬司令官提出最後通牒，羅馬之義軍司令官在此壓迫之下已告屈服。義軍現正在解除武裝、駐那不勒斯與　列諾之德軍已取得聯絡、德軍並已接收保護梵蒂岡之工作。羅美爾元帥率其所部之師團、在義大利北部經短促而極爲劇烈之爭鬥後，迫使義軍投降，由加林斯亞（Carinthia）與泰羅爾（Tyrol）通達義大利北部之鐵道綫與公路，均在德軍手中、並未被毀、由熱諾亞至斯比西亞之里格利亞梅岸巳經佔領，波洛那伐羅那與克里蒙那區之各市鎭已經肅淸。同時特別期脫（Tridwte）亦已被佔領，該處義軍九萬餘人已被解除武裝。法國南部義大利　四軍巳向德軍倫資特元帥之部隊繳械，並未發生任何事件。由都降（Toulon）至曼頓（Mentone）沿海岸已由德軍佔領。巴爾幹之各義軍司令均以諒解之態度、徇德軍總司令威契斯元帥之要求而投降義軍「東路」集團軍各師團與在雅典之第十一軍、大半均已放下武器。愛琴海中之義大利兵艦與商船已由德海軍接收。以前之義大利飛機塲以及亞特里亞海沿岸大多數重要之口岸，均已由德軍加以佔領，僅少數地方仍在爭鬥中。義軍歸向德軍以便繼續對英美作戰者日見增多，因此叛逆者已自蒙其害，巴特里奧之勢力不復存在，而世界對於叛逆者之輕視則將永久存在。</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　軍界權威方面本日在此間宣布：除少數例外情形外，東南歐之義軍已遵德軍之命繳械，並未發生事變。星期四希臘及克里特義軍之投降，並未再發生事變，克里特之義軍一部份要求加人德軍，希臘海港之義軍艦及商船亦已由德軍接收。同時所有歐洲東南之義機塲，亦巳由德方接管，所有飛機亦巳接收。社特坎尼斯羣島曾發生因難，該處之司令起先拒絕命令其部隊繳械，但經短時問之戰鬥後，即被解除武裝。</p>
<h3>義王室貴胄　避居瑞士</h3>
<p>百倫十一日中央社電　據今日悉：義公主　利喬賽於星期四偕　子女越義邊境而人瑞士，今日又有沙伏愛公主、喬蘭達柏爾哥羅伯　夫人。及義王愛麥虞限長女偕其子女抵直迦諾　渠　　正居於該處某大旅邶中，喬賽公主似有久居瑞士之準備，以摩托卡車裝來之糖義傢具堆積如山。</p>
<h3>巴特里奧行踪之谜一说抵西西里</h3>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　關於巴特里奥之確悉，目下仍感缺乏。倫教官方昨夜宣稱：巴特里奥及共聞員等、似滯留於南義，惟此息尙無來自他處之報告證實。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十一日中央社電　　阿爾及爾電：巴特里奧傳　行抵西西里島，該傀儡政權似　於巴勒摩。</p>
<h3>亚特里亚海岸東岸将有大戰德軍進駐阿爾巴尼亞</h3>
<p>里期本十一日中央社　電據倫敦消息：阿爾巴尼亞似有即將發生大規模戰鬥之可能，自德軍佔領阿爾巴尼亞後，理義邊境傳來消息謂有英美護航隊一大隊，由軍　護航、已自愛奧尼亞海港出發，以有力之空軍掩護，開始駛向阿爾巴尼亞。又傳有英美護航隊一大隊已在愛奧尼亞海行駛中。以前路透社曾引匈牙利消息，謂德單業已佔領阿爾巴尼亞及亞特里亞海東岸全部，猶憶　軍係於一九一九年四月佔領阿爾巴尼亞。</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電據海通社訊、權威方面昨晚官稱：爲實施巴特里奧投降　之必要措施起見，德國快速軍隊已開入阿爾巴尼亞，佔領伐隆那、杜拉索、及伊爾巴桑等城。克羅地亞特里亞海岸之拉哥薩城亦被佔領。沿亞特里亞海岸之義軍解除武裝，各處均無意外事件，海岸砲台與其他防禦設施，改由德軍專門部隊接管，各地居民皆極鎭靜，阿爾巴尼亞輿蒙特尼格羅各地之男子，自動成立志願軍團，受德軍司令之指揮。</p>
<h3>反軸心軍佔領泰蘭吐</h3>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　據阿爾及爾電，北非反軸心軍司令部十一日發表：反軸心軍登陸部隊與海軍部隊協力下，佔領義國南部之泰蘭吐（Taranto）</p>
<h3>那不勒斯　義軍投降</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電據德國新聞社引軍事方面稱：那不勒斯之義軍，經短時間之戰鬥後，巳向德軍繳械投誠，一部義軍則投歸在薩列諾潛登陸之美軍、參加對德軍作戰</p>
<h3>義法西斯新政府採執政委會制　地點在德義邊境</h3>
<p>沮里克十一日中央社電　據傳巴特里奧巳於德軍佔領羅馬前，秘密脫出該市。又　最近情形傳：巴特軍奥將辭職，其後任或爲卡維里亞，按卡氏爲過去工美份子中知名人物，義國投降英美後，即與德方交涉處理羅馬德僑問題。</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　德外交當局對於義大利法西斯國民政府之組織問題。避免明言。十日正午會見記者團時，乃就此談稱：著名之義國要人數名，已尤任閣　。外國方面所傳引渡墨索里尼，乃艾森霍華對巴特里奥提出投降條件之消息、亦不能謂其全無根據。各方而對於法西斯國民政府成立之反響頗大、法四斯義勇軍即將編成。據消息靈通方面所傳，新政府預定採取執政委員會形式、而由前法西斯黨秘書長法利那齊、前文化宣傳部長巴佛里尼及統帥之公子　特甸奧三氏組成執政委員會，委員會之下任命行政長官。據謂前敎育部長鮑泰亦將參加新政府，新政府似設於德義國境地帶，將來或遷至德義交通便利之地白倫納山隘防方某要銜。</p>

<h3>東綫德軍退出　馬留坡爾</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　據德軍當局發表：東綫亞泰夫海岸馬留坡爾（Mariupol）之德軍於破壞一切軍事設施後，依照預定計劃已自該地撤退。</p>
<h3>希特勒廣播宣示奮鬥决心　譴責巴特里奧背棄信義</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　打破長時間之緘默，德元首希特勤昨晚（柏林夏季時刻十日八時半）藉無綫電發表演說，謂將以一切方法以粉碎敵人之希望，繼稱，義大利之在戰事中，除出於軍事上僅不甚重要之事也。自戰爭以來，德國經常予義軍以援助，對於義前首相墨索里尼曾致力於排除義大利人民之敵人，德國對之當有以報答。德國現有充足之理由，以作堅定之自信，觀於德軍之決心及成就，即可如之。渠對人民保證德軍必獲最後之勝利，現巳自迷惑於期望中重行解放，故對德人再作演說，此其時矣。義大利之崩潰乃可預見者，此非　於義國之不能再作更有效之抵抗、亦非無抵抗之必要，其實由於做成投降之份子之雄心，乃彼等有計劃陰謀破壞之結果，現所成功者，不過僅以義大利之統治，以背棄德國及義國之一切盟國之行動，而委於共同敵人之手。</p>
<p>追溯往事禍根潛伏</p>
<p>一九三九年九月英法對德宣戰後，義大利基於條約之關係，不得不宣佈與德國共同一致，墨索里尼首相即欲實行總觔員之行動，但現今造成投降者之徒已於八月間做成阻止義大利參戰之力量，當時即知義大利國內之困難，並不壓迫其立即參戰，而任義大利以選探參戰時　。一九四○年六日墨索里尼完成內在之必要前　，而使義大利參加德方作戰、而對於墨氏於極困難中所採之態度及步驟，　極感激。</p>
<p>同甘共苦駢肩作戰</p>
<p>此後德義軍於各地共同流血，而羅美爾將軍實與有勞焉，一九四一年春季德軍決定援義於巴爾幹，此非義人之意志，不過所以除去德國之危機而已，德軍在巴爾幹行動之時，實將有事於對蘇攻擊之準備，德人均以義大利之掌舵者墨索里尼獲得義人絕對之掩護，乃爲繼續德義聯盟之先決條件，其潰敗也義人將必感覺其爲終身之玷，義政變之最後行動，實緣於墨氏要求加緊作戰，遂對於破壞作戰者採取嚴厲之措施，最後墨索里尼又欲除去義人之敵，以求義國之安存，而其時德人不顧一切，其海陸空軍仍奮勇作戰於四西里、此不獨保護德國而亦保　義大利之國土也。</p>
<p>背棄信久罪不可逭</p>
<p>義國之領袖決心破壞盟約，以使義境淪爲戰塲，其理或甚多，但其不告其盟國而單獨行動，實不可恕、而於停戰協定簽字之日、巴特里奧猶告德國代辦稱，謂彼永不出賣德國，義大剎並無有投降之思想，而一句鐘後、其叛逆之行動竟實行公佈矣，而謂義參謀長曾以此事告知德國軍事代表者，此不過英國之一種宣傳。德人於兩年之內。實已了解此背叛逆勢力之發展，而於政府之更換，其真意當已洞悉無遺，對於義人之行動，德軍早已採取一切佈置。　人這作戰乃非常神聖者，因敗者必遭燬滅，而勝者方有生存之望焉，故決定以一切之步驟，粉碎敵人</p>
<p>個人生命早置度外</p>
<p>義人之退出軸心、於軍事要點無甚意義、德國決將繼　作戰。而敵人欲以施於義大利之方法以對德人，實大謬誤，欲於德國做成第二個之七月廿五亦不可能。余久不以個人之生命爲念，而所着重者，乃國家數百年後之安存而已。前曾對國會言及，謂世界上無論時間及武力，均不能燬滅德國，現敵人所能者，乃以恐怖之空襲方法，此不獨以看人之機械以　破此種攻勢，且已作更有力之報復矣於戰略上之理由、吾人或被迫放棄若干之據點，但以德軍之血所做成之鋼環、乃不能擊破者也。德人應有自信自恃之能力，對義大利之事件巳依照預定計劃進行，南斯拉夫叛逆之敎訓，可予現與德國聯盟之國家一絕好榜樣。</p>
<h3>歐戰第五年　各國內外情勢的檢討（一）</h3>
<p>德國</p>
<p>此次戰爭爲世界的戰爭。從地理的關係上說，雖分爲歐洲與東亞二個不同的戰塲，但在本質上却是一個戰爭。純粹從軍事的見地來看，如其歐洲或東亞的任何一方勝敗一經決定，對另一戰塲當然也有決定的影響。又後世界觀上來看，有以日本爲盟主的大束亞新秩序，及以　洲爲盟主的歐洲新秩序的建設二種大理想。和妨害壓追這理想的英美之間，無可避免地發生了戰爭。二者之中的任何一方，在達到這理想之前，不能因在中　遇到挫折而停止。</p>
<p>主要戰塲仍在東綫</p>
<p>德國二年前閉始與蘇聯交戰，以至今日，共武力的解決之日、殊難預期、此即在德國當局，亦曾屢加　述。就動員的兵力及其他而言，德國視爲主要戰塲者今日依然在於東戰綫。決定全戰局者爲對蘇戰塲的看法，爲不可動搖的事實。假定在本年冬季之前，蘇聯力量業已消竭，則德國將從東戰塲撤退大部分兵力，尤其是空軍，以備英美的攻擊，並充實對空炸的防備、甚至於進而攻略英國本土，亦大有可能</p>
<p>勝利的美夢</p>
<p>戰爭在一九四○年法國降伏前。的確出於一般人意料之外，有利於德國而進展着。英軍在鄧扣克幾潰不成軍。那時候大家都以爲德國的勝利快要完成了。一九四一年的巴爾幹戰爭，亦進行順利，在那時以前、德國沉醉於勝利的美夢中。這種絕對的勝利觀或多或少地對本年夏開始的德蘇戰發生消極的作用。但在德蘇的諸戰中，這勝利觀亦似一席盛行。直至一九四一年之冬，德重遭遇了未曾想到的酷寒，而陷於苦境時，始深切地認識不僅在規模上是和對法戰等不間性質的戰爭。</p>
<p>英美壓力加重</p>
<p>一九四二年，德國再度向烏克蘭。高加索大道攻，在那年冬季，右蘇聯的冬季攻勢，自本年七月初，在奧萊爾，貝爾格洛特之間。蘇聯又開始攻勢，這期間，一九四一年十二月，因大東亞戰的勃發，使以前實際上業已顯然是敵性國家的美國，至此成爲德義的名實俱副的敵人。英美的壓力，從西南方而漸見加重，一九四二年秋，在北非登陸、不久，攻　突尼西亞成功、但可以减　蘇聯負擔的第二戰綫之構成，迄今未見實現。</p>
<p>英美之對德義不分皂白的空襲，慘殺婦孺，破壞文化設施，其野蠻的行爲，姑作別論，但此在精神上物質上所及於德義人民的影響，則不能加以忽視。唯結果所屆，這不能說是決定戰爭的因素。</p>
<p>國內情形安定</p>
<p>就國內情形而言，國家社會主義的政治統制，極爲穩固，並沒有像前次大戰時從內部發生　隙而趨於擴大並組織化的危險。對淤敵力空炸所能引此社會不安，今視衛隊長希姆萊氏兼任內長，並加强其權限而鎭　之。最重要的食糧方面，仍一貫採取「細而長」的方策，無論前綫兵士，後方一般國民，既不感到滿腹，亦不覺得飢餓，一般國民忍受一切不自由及不便，不屈不撓地繼續戰爭。這樣考察起來，德國　便不能擊潰敵的戰鬥力，但在今夏之戰中，亦已予敵痛擊，今後且將繼　打擊敵人，所以如其德國能把其兵力轉向西南方面，則將長前所述，轉變今日的防　態勢，改取攻勢，以阻止敵人大有可能。（翔：譯自九月一日西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>從貼紙說起</h3>
<p>沂來各路商店的玻璃上都給貼了形形色色的紙條，，爲什麼需要貼紙？怎樣貼紙？我們暫且不加申論。想說的是：所貼紙　的形式花樣，有的是一絲不苟，煞費苦心，鑲成很有意義的廣告，如運動器具公司，甲紙條編貼成網球拍的形式，樂器公司則貼上了一行行的剪形五　譜，我們認爲最有意義的，是某鐘　店廚窗上所貼着的「時間問題」四個大字，它們好像給了我們一個警覺：「時間是如何可寶貴的啊！」可是，其中粗製歪曲，潦草塞貴，絕無藝術的却也不少。</p>
<p>於此，我們不免引起了一些感想：那些，形式不一的細紙條，其所代表的，不僅是表面上所謂的「色相」，同時也代表了無數經理與店友們的不同個性，藝術感·和辦事的才能等等。簡言之，凡所貼的紙條，其形式整齊精美，亦即表示負則人辦事的認眞，雖在細節上，亦思勝人一籌，必是該榮中的勝利者。耶敎經典上說，「在小事上忠實的，在大事上亦然！」</p>
<p>從這次的貼紙，我們更由小及大的推論。社會國家莫不盡然，所以社票領導人物，國家執政當局的是否負責認眞，就可從這一社會這一國家的各方面窺見，也就是還一社會這一國家的面貌，可以反映它們領導人物執政常局的是否得人。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>上海經濟界的心理</h3>
<p>關於巴特里奥政　投降與上海經濟界人士　具之決心，上海日本工商會議所生席靑木節氏於其日昨發表的談話中說：「上海經濟界情况，　爲鎮靜，我人不須因戰局之進退而動搖心理，同時更不應因他國政治之變動而發生游移」</p>
<p>說到上　趨消界的心理，我們從前已經說通，在一個時期裏面，最普遍的就是物値看高　幣値看低的心理，其次就是　　個人發財，不　　家利益的心理。我們並且也說過，今日上海金融問品市塲，人心一致虛怯，　存觀望態度，以致市氣奄然，是爲心處的病態，心處則意志游移薄弱，一無　取精神，其結果徒爲自誤。</p>
<p>「天下本無事，庸人自擾之」，是中國一句老話，明明沒有什麽可以顧慮的，偏偏要抱着「杞人憂天」的心理，弄得到處「杯弓蛇影」·以致心理所趨，大有工廠快要沒有原料了或是工廠快要不能開工了。在戰時促進生產，安定民生的一個斷然政策之下，豈容這樣一個「因　廢食」心理的存在？何况根本就談不到「噎」呢？</p>
<p>上海經濟情况，既然是極爲鎭靜，那末，上海經　界人的心理，即常處處出以鎮靜，並常繼續努力，以向生產之遂邁進，萬勿「自擾」，致誤前程。</p>

<p>昨華股起落無常，兩度下落均即回上，午收後之情況尤緊，然起先下降遇巨，比前日價一致軋小，人心　測不一，成交大會減少，金融界及大戶仍在觀望中。百貨業起先最爲虛軟，永安二度銳退而又回上，午收後有求少供，突然上升，然比前日仍見軋小。新新·國貨·麗華三公司下降較勁，中國內衣下降亦烈，景福衫襪重見做低，紡織榮所降有限，永安紡織削低級許，午收後已有買戶，大生一三兩廢·達豐染織廣勤與慶豐紡織均覓挫。小票面下降較勁，中紡，雷和·五和·鴻興·宏　·大中華織造等各見削低。美綸毛　仍維特乏術。新榮業僅中西·中英仍站原價，五洲·中法·新亞·信誼·新星均不支而下。文化業商務與中華同見喊小，永祥·動工造紙·標準紙品原價喊出，少成交。公用業呆平，華商電氣　昻，閘北水電公用電機，祥生三輪均少變化，內地自來水。中興煤礦·漢冶萍。靑紹商輪之減償與上兩日雷同。中國與華　水泥均疲，大中華火榮削低不少，華成煙草求供價未接近，少成交。南洋煙公司　入級內，　華油　　告平疲，家　工　　歌，三友實業仍平，中華橡膠突見低落。實業股最形　軟，久安·興華·大中華實業均在責勞中銳　，與新亞建業同見　低。地產縈下降尙　，新益。脫華·永興盤小有限，保安玻璃獨平，梅林罐頭。社生　買戶喊價更低，　準味粉·福民乳品仍在呆完中，大華　積·　　計織·中　木業市平。金幫業亦多挫進·僅中一　　少變化，大陸·上海·浙興·金城·　業等銀行各露遜色。</p>
<p>商情摘要</p>
<p>公債　昨日統一公價市况，初開人心頗爲堅硬，中途嘗者較夥，市態因此轉軟，然至中午仍見囘升，結果丙種述升二級，甲乙丁戊亦見高升甚勁，其他均朱做開。</p>

<h3>老殘孤寡的庇托所上海慈聯救災會速寫</h3>
<p>泥　地上和　席棚裏發出急待濟助的呼聲</p>
<p>除了車軸偶然綢過之外，很少高等市民光臨的北浙江路七浦路口·在「新衙門」南首、有一垜近乎圯塌的古老的矮　·立在碎石鋪就的寬闊的馬路上，司以看到矮　裏幾問　　棚戶的殘破的　頂。走近矮趨，原來向東問着大門門頂　　樣明是「上海慈善團體聯合救炎會餐濟院」，據說，這是上海中國人自辦的此較觀模最大的一個慈善團體！</p>
<p>慈聯養濟　院踏視記</p>
<p>走進大門·哦！原來是一片荒塲，原來就是從前的義塜地！在這不平的荒塲上，最　目的是右側前方的幾座　蓆棚戶·給不久以前的一天狂風大雨所蹂　·已經像是被挖去眼睛，割去耳朶、斬去四肢，不！簡直是一具具的搖搖欲倒的　　了！那裏有幾分人的氣息？誰會相信·這裏是繁節當　的上海的一角？眼前所見的，不是弟古戰塲文中所描寫的「　　慘悴·風悲日　」的沙塲嗎？然而、當未近這些搖搖欲倒的偶髏式的棚戶之時，你又會駕異，這些正　　着無告的老殘孤寡的一羣呢！</p>
<p>這就是上海慈善團體聯合救災會所辦的主要事業—慈聯養濟院。這些棚戶被劃分爲四區·老，殘·孤·寡。</p>
<p>老人區現在佔有大棚戶一座，進門處還有管理者的小房相當完整，黑板上記明收容六十歲以上的男女老人七十六名，可見當初辦理的規模與嚴密，幾個老人蜷伏或偃臥在地上和上　鋪位上，都有自己僅有的破爛輿汚穢的方被和蓆子，大雨大風留下　了凉的痕跡，上層鋪位上可以暢　風雲，下層雖有地板，却巳破爛、充滿點，正是吃「中飯」的時　，有幾個在撈着粥吃，嘴裏念着「阿彌陀佛」，表示對於教濟者的感激。</p>
<p>殘　區另佔一大間比人更殘廢的棚戶，寫明現在收容的人數爲九十七名，戶內的情形和老人區一梯，大風雨造成了室內　行道上的泥濘，爲着支持這棚戶不致倒塌，裏而支着許多斜柱。誰要通過走道，就得一次又一次的俯身鑽過去，屋頂的　枝會因風吹到你頭上，而脚下一不小心又會使你跌交。但殘　者怡然處之，在馬路上求乞的苦惱使他們感一到這裏巳是天堂了。</p>
<p>孤寡區和兒童敎養所</p>
<p>寡　區，收容的是難民中的寡婦及共子女，據說共達二百七十三人之多，所佔的那座棚戶，雖然一樣的殘破，但是寡婦不比六十以上的老人與殘廢者，她們在努力於暴風雨後的修整工作，一位廣東籍的難婦，正奉同她的小孩子，在淸洗及修補自己的舖位。有幾處的舖位，給用草蓆分隔着·居然也有熱水瓶，餐具，和她們自己的舖蓋。有人已在吃白米粥，用紅乳腐佐養，吃得津津有味，有人則正在自己舖位上切南瓜，預備午　。雖然大部分衣破肉露，但也有穿得相當整齊的，因爲她們到外面去「打工」，得到些可憐的收入。</p>
<p>孤兒區最大，原有四座棚戶，兩座是工塲與「敎室」，其餘兩座是臥室。工塲以編　網袋及白手套（工人用）爲主，特別是網袋，她們所選以料較佳，做工也較精細，比市即上所見的較大且較堅實。向銷各大公司。看到這　製品，決不會想到是出於衣食不足的孤兒之手的吧！你看，　結的多麽整齊漂亮啊！</p>
<p>現在孤兒們的棚戶也被暴風雨所摧殘，工塲已陷於停頓，八十九個孤兒擠在一個比較完整的棚戶裏，然而屋頂與籬壁也抵擋不了風雨的侵襲啊！</p>
<p>進門的左前方，還有慈濟兒童敎養所·範圍比較小些·房屋也比較完整些，然而也　處暴露出暴風雨製擊後的零亂，汚穢與泥濘。孩子們的住所·用具，餐具，不區　　　的人們所不敢用手去摸一下，也許看也不敢正眼相　　吧。然而孩子們却活　地生活着。是正午，男孩子們巳在洗灌餐具·會孩子們在小小的院子裏　結絨綫衫之類，是敎養所向外界接東的定貸。男孩子的衣服比較差些，女孩子們還算整潔　像是什麽中下，家庭的子女。（轉入第四版）</p>

<h3>佛堂診室和工塲</h3>
<p>慈戰　院裏，有一座佛堂，是全院最　整與最潔凈的所在，光景和普遍的小　寧邀不多，遺憾的是沒有實到主持者，不能仔細訪間，只有一位聽覺似乎不很清楚見人欲　不　的男戲縫在幹活兒。　堂口的大鐘上，　　　着一批大着士的名號。據說，每天淸晨有人打打鐘唸唸經，算是做「早課」，這是主要的敎育工作吧</p>
<p>對於孤兒，據說曾經有過非正式的教育，分爲六級·每天上午工作，下千讀書，後以經費困難而停辦。現在，大概也是這次暴風雨的蹂躪吧、敎室只留下幾具屋架子、因此，想拜訪幾位敎師也就做不到了，眞是遺憾得很。就在「兒童敎養院」吧，在規模上頗有些學校的型式，可惜參觀時也是暴風雨後數十天，還沒有能夠恢復正式的敎育設施吧！</p>
<p>對於老殘孤寡的　生，據說是非常注意的，總務主任錢先生介紹到一所標明爲醫務室的棚戶去，裏　有幾只桌子，和一座陳列些　品的大　。說有一位中醫徐　　氏經常來診治、並有兩位看護經常在院照顧，旁邊有一問病房、幾位女病人在使喚看　小如添粥，看來列像是節有身份的樣子、病房的一切、也確實比老殘孤寡各　　　得多。</p>
<p>院裏，附　　一所「　　工集合作社」，實際上是一　玩具工廠。主要出品是木質玩具。如手槍，坦克，汽車，犬　等等，　　整　，工作緊張，充滿朝氣，是一個生利機關。但是除了吸收院裹少數孤寡爲工人之外，似乎和慈聯會沒有眞撞隸屬關係，倒是很可惜的</p>
<p>回顧於前瞻</p>
<p>上海慈善團體　合救災會的現况，大致就是如此。但是，會對於上　社會，確有很大的意義，這裏所收容的老殘孤寡，都是上海戰事時留下來的，在過去，幾乎都會有過美滿的家庭，許多男女退會受過　當教育戰發時都棄家逃進上海租界，由於忠厚，不知投機，才　愴地托庇於各難民收容所。前年卞二月後，上海局面轉變，不久之後，一度發生糧食問題，同時社會也　　安定，於是各難民收　所先後於去年春季實告解散。然而，當時確實無家可歸的老病殘廢孤，寡婦，幾乎　於死亡的絕境。惻隱之心，人皆有之。慈善家聞朧亭　　　　老先生，乃盡力協助將各難民收容所給東時無可遣歸者，由上論慈善團體聯合救災　·成立此慈聯養務院。又爲救濟一般雖有母親而無力養育的貧苦兒童，給以敎養，與中國濟生食合力親織慈濟兒童教養院。養濟院自上年四月改組成立之始，言由公共租界工部局擔任給養三個月，計十萬元，不足之數，卽歸慈救會籌補。七月以後，全部費用，完全慈救會擔負。但該會本身旣無基金·又無資產，捐募所得，又尙有其他養舉開支，不能專件養　院之用，因此經費困難，達於極點，其後上海市貧病救濟協會成立，曾申請補助，當經　詠華委員前往調査。認爲有急予補助之需要，自本年二月份起，補助養濟院每月一萬二千元，敎養所每月四千元，至六月止共九萬六千元，本年八月又一次繼續補助養濟院三萬元、教養所九千元。但以一般捐募所入不多，而物價高漲，開支增加，現在養濟院收容老殘孤寡共五百四十五名，職員二十人，工役六十四人，共　六百十九人之多。每名每日發米二次，每次五兩三錢，每月已需一萬斤以上，敎養院所收災童二百六十五人，戰工較少，但開文亦屬不少。至於一般戰工，完全抱着犧牲服務的精神，人人有「我不入地　　人地獄」的氣概，他們所支薪金，最高不過二百四十元，工役不過十二元！勝宿幾乎完全與難民相等。有不少職員的家屬，也因爲無法生活而被編入難民隊裏去了！在他們固然求仁得仁，艱苦無怨，但是社會上不　熱心人士·怎忍他們常　地　之中，特別是在目前，　　棚戶·毀者巳矣、存存亦搖搖欲倒·不能蔽風雨，如不立即　集鉅　，如以　　整頓。則秋雨冬風，此近千的生命，將不免同　於書，所以救人於　寒者仍不免於凍餒而死將使人對慈善事　　之力長、我們渴盼社會上有之力　臂而起、有具　助之！</p>

<h3>Wartime Social Policy Issues</h3>
<p>— Ren Yuan</p>
<p>Social policy in peacetime is a policy used to remedy the shortcomings of the modern economic system, with the aim of guiding society and transforming society. Although the content of theories and policies are not entirely the same, in principle they are not too far apart. As for wartime, the national economy inevitably undergoes drastic changes, and society and national life will undergo major transformations. The discovery of abnormal phenomena and shortcomings in the process is unavoidable. Therefore, social policies that can adapt to wartime conditions are needed to remedy and guide them. At this moment when the World War is heading towards a decisive stage, it is no coincidence that social policies of various countries are given the same importance as military economy. The article "Japan's Wartime Social Policy" published in the Shen Bao on the 8th is a good example.</p>
<p>Throughout the dynasties, Chinese politicians and their administrations have always attached great importance to the lives of ordinary people, and assistance and guidance have been listed as important political strategies. Chinese ethics take "filial piety" as the primary meaning, "family" as the foundation of society, and "five generations living under one roof" as a symbol of happiness. The saying "may your descendants be numerous" has become a congratulatory idiom. Therefore, invisibly, it has become a driving force for the national population reproduction policy among the people. Modern Japanese and German wartime social policies place their emphasis on population policy, that is, the maintenance and cultivation of human resources, using various methods to encourage marriage and childbirth, in order to achieve their wartime national policy. However, in our country, it is actually unnecessary to put much effort into this aspect. Today's social policy in our country, in terms of population countermeasures, instead of focusing on increasing the population, it is better to study how to improve eugenics, that is, to strive to encourage the reproduction of outstanding citizens and find ways to prevent people with genetic diseases from giving birth. What is even more important in our country today is "population maintenance," that is, the maintenance of the minimum living standards of the existing population, the protection of health, and the guidance of physical and mental activities. Efforts must be made to reduce infant mortality, maternal mortality, and lower the general mortality rate of the people. According to general statistics, the reproductive capacity of the Chinese population is not as good as that of European and American powers, but the high mortality rate is comparable to that of India (India has the highest mortality rate in the world, but its reproductive rate is also particularly strong), and among the people of the whole country, the number of truly healthy people must be calculated in terms of a few thousandths or ten thousandths. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen once shouted loudly, "The crisis of the extinction of the Chinese nation." If we want to stand side by side with the great powers in the world after the war, we must redouble our efforts in population maintenance policies at this time, eliminate abnormal population mortality, and eliminate the shame of the "sick man of East Asia."</p>
<p>The main items of the policies of maintaining and cultivating human resources of contemporary powers are roughly: Guarantee of the minimum standard of living and improvement of national life; Expansion of the social insurance system; Protection of the lives of workers, staff and agricultural laborers; Enrichment and popularization of medical, health and health care facilities; Promotion and improvement of national social education. In order to realize these requirements, the government has specialized institutions and personnel responsible for implementing wartime social policies, the government includes in the budget the definite funds necessary for implementing social policies, the government also sets up a certain supervisory body, and at the same time maintains close contact with public opinion organs, so that wartime social policies not only have brilliant laws and institutions, but also can harvest real results, assisting the country's entire wartime policy and completing the system of total war. Today, we hope that the authorities will not neglect this aspect and catch up quickly.</p>
<p>In order to protect the national life during the war and further improve it, in addition to the protection laws for mothers and children, rescue of teenagers, etc., disaster protection laws, and children's abuse prevention laws, Japan also has judicial protection, wartime disaster insurance system, and a sufficient rationing system for food, clothing and daily necessities to stabilize national life. Germany also has unemployment relief, protection of pregnant women, assistance in infant rearing, protection of maternity, and popularization of nurseries. In our country, the first thing to be solved is the problem of food for the people, so that everyone has enough to eat; then eliminate the phenomenon of extreme wealth and poverty to improve the national wartime life. Secondly, the social insurance system has been in place in the great powers for a long time. Recently, the Ministry of Social Welfare has launched labor insurance to meet the special needs of wartime. It seems that it should be promoted as soon as possible. The social insurance system in Japan has made great progress during the war, and has successively created the national health insurance system, the staff health insurance system, the seafarer insurance system, and the worker pension insurance system, and the results are remarkable. Germany has sickness insurance, accident insurance, pension insurance, disability insurance, clerical insurance, and miner insurance. In short, they are all sufficient to show the country's practical concern and protection for the people's lives during and after the war, and then the people can automatically stand up and be loyal to the country. Otherwise, even if they are supervised day and night and punished severely, the effect will be minimal.</p>
<p>Under the total war system, in order to win the decisive force for the final victory, in addition to the soldiers on the front line, it also depends on the cooperation of the people in the rear, especially the efforts of workers and peasants in the production sector. Therefore, how to improve the enthusiasm of workers and peasants in production to serve the country is one of the central tasks of social policy.</p>
<p>Medical, health and health care facilities are even more important during wartime. Taking Japan as an example, the core agency "Health Center" that guides national health during the war was planned to build 49 in 1938, but now there are 239, and 80 more will be added by the end of this year. The number of health care instructors has also increased from 4,000 to 7,000. In terms of medical care, the National Medical Care Act was formulated last year, and the Japan Medical Group was established with a business fund of 600 million yen to engage in the prevention and eradication of tuberculosis. In order to improve the content of medical care, national medical institutions are universally established from cities to villages throughout the country, and they are becoming increasingly developed. Our authorities seem to be making urgent efforts in this regard to protect national health.</p>
<p>Finally, it is hoped that the popular promotion of national social education will enable ordinary citizens to have a correct understanding of war and the country and society. At the same time, for the practice of wartime life, the importance of public health, the cooperation of social services, and the maintenance of public order, everyone can be self-aware and self-help and self-govern through the popularization of social education. Then, under the unified policies and laws of the country, it will be gathered into a huge force. In this way, total participation in the war will have its actual meaning, and the construction of the new China and the Greater East Asia can be guaranteed most reliably.</p>

<p>Berlin, November 11th (Central News Agency) - The German Führer's headquarters issued a special communique stating that after a short period of fighting, German troops occupied Rome on Friday and are now disarming the Italian troops around the capital of Italy. The text of the communique is as follows: In recent weeks, the "rebellious Bartriolio government" had concentrated a large army around Rome in preparation for escape and took defensive measures against the German troops stationed outside Rome, using the threat of the enemy's landing in the west of Rome as an excuse. Since Italy surrendered to the enemy on the evening of September 8, war has broken out between German and Italian troops around Rome. Field Marshal Keisellin, the commander-in-chief of the German army in the south, launched an attack on Rome after receiving reinforcements and issued an ultimatum to the commander of Rome. The commander of the Italian army in Rome has surrendered under this pressure. The Italian army is now being disarmed, and the German army stationed in Naples and Reno has made contact. The German army has also taken over the protection of the Vatican. Field Marshal Rommel led his divisions and forced the Italian army to surrender after a short and extremely fierce struggle in northern Italy.

The former Italian airfields and most of the important ports along the Adriatic Sea have been occupied by the German army, and only a few places are still in fighting. The number of Italian troops returning to the German army in order to continue fighting against the British and Americans is increasing day by day. Therefore, the rebels have been harmed by themselves, Bartriolio's power no longer exists, and the world's contempt for the rebels will exist forever.</p>

<p>Berlin, November 11th (Central News Agency) - German diplomatic authorities avoided making a clear statement on the issue of the organization of the Italian Fascist National Government. When meeting with a group of reporters at noon on the 10th, he said in this regard: Several famous Italian dignitaries have been appointed to the cabinet. The news that Mussolini was extradited, which was spread by foreign sources, was the news that Eisenhower made a condition of surrender to Bartriolio. It cannot be said that it is completely unfounded. All parties have had a great reaction to the establishment of the Fascist National Government, and the Fascist volunteer army will be formed soon. According to reports from well-informed sources, the new government is expected to adopt an executive committee form, which will be composed of former Fascist Party Secretary-General Farinacci, former Minister of Culture and Propaganda Bavorini, and Marshal's son Trutdino.

<h3>Governor Chen Announces Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 11th (Central News Agency) - The Supreme National Defense Conference held a temporary meeting on the 10th and approved the special appointment of the current Minister of the Interior Chen Qun as the Governor of Jiangsu Province. Mr. Chen was appointed as the Minister of the Interior during the Reorganized National Government before the National Government returned to its capital. He made great efforts to comfort and appease the displaced people. After the National Government returned to its capital, he was re-elected by the government to continue his duties. He has been in office for several years and has made remarkable achievements in the reform of internal affairs. However, because he has been too busy with official duties in the past, he has rarely made statements to the outside world. In order to understand Chen's aspirations and feelings for governing Jiangsu Province, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Chen's official residence and was granted an interview. He also made a statement, and the gist of which is as follows: I have received the government's order to govern Jiangsu Province. At this critical time, there are really no policy guidelines to speak of. And I have always advocated that governing a country does not require much talk, so what can be said today is that the people of Jiangsu are in deep water and fire after the war. After I take office, I will immediately start to improve everything and seek the stability of the people's lives. Under the organization and jurisdiction of the central government, all local policies should be in line with the central government's intentions and absolutely accept the orders and guidance of the central ministries and departments. The format of official documents to the central ministries will also be in the style of reports from subordinates to superiors. After taking office, I will not make any changes in personnel, because they serve the country, not me personally. The appointment of personnel should follow the central government's intentions and be based on their experience and knowledge to determine whether they are competent. Even for the position of county magistrate, they must have at least three years of experience as a section chief in the county government before they can be appointed. As for national taxes, in addition to asking the central government to send people to be in charge of accounting, the local elders should be responsible for ensuring that national tax revenues are remitted to the national treasury without any leakage to enrich the national finances. The date of taking office has not yet been determined. I will take office as soon as the transfer of the Ministry of the Interior is completed.</p>

<h3>Hitler's Radio Declaration of Determination to Fight, Condemning Badoglio's Betrayal of Faith</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - Breaking a long silence, German leader Hitler delivered a speech via radio last night (8:30 PM Berlin Summer Time on the 10th), stating that he would use all means to crush the enemy's hopes. He then said that Italy's involvement in the war, apart from being of little military importance, was due to Germany's constant assistance to the Italian army since the war began. Germany should repay former Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's efforts to eliminate the enemies of the Italian people. Germany now has ample reason to be firmly confident, which can be seen in the determination and achievements of the German army. He assured the people that the German army would achieve final victory and that they have now been liberated from being misled by expectations. Therefore, it is time to address the German people again. The collapse of Italy was foreseeable, not because Italy could no longer mount an effective resistance or because there was no need for resistance, but because of the ambition of those who made the surrender possible. It was the result of their planned conspiracy of sabotage. What they have succeeded in doing is merely handing over the rule of Italy to the common enemy through actions that betray Germany and all of Italy's allies.</p>
<p>Tracing the Roots of Past Events</p>
<p>After England and France declared war on Germany in September 1939, Italy had no choice but to declare solidarity with Germany based on treaty relations. Prime Minister Mussolini wanted to implement a general member's action, but those who caused the surrender had already created the power to prevent Italy from joining the war in August. At that time, it was known that Italy's domestic difficulties did not compel it to immediately join the war, and Italy was allowed to choose when to participate. In June 1940, Mussolini completed the necessary internal preparations and allowed Italy to participate in the war on the German side. We are extremely grateful for Mr. Mussolini's attitude and steps taken in extremely difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>Sharing Weal and Woe, Fighting Shoulder to Shoulder</p>
<p>Since then, German and Italian troops have shed blood together in various places, and General Rommel has made significant contributions. In the spring of 1941, the German army decided to assist Italy in the Balkans, not according to the will of the Italians, but solely to remove the German crisis. When the German army was operating in the Balkans, it was actually preparing for an attack on the Soviet Union. The Germans believed that Mussolini, the helmsman of Italy, had obtained the absolute protection of the Italian people, which was a prerequisite for the continuation of the German-Italian alliance. Its collapse will surely be felt by the Italian people as a lifelong disgrace. The final action of the Italian coup was due to Mussolini's request to intensify the war, and he took strict measures against those who sabotaged the war. Finally, Mussolini wanted to eliminate Italy's enemies in order to seek Italy's security. At that time, the Germans, regardless of everything, their navy, army, and air force still fought bravely in Sicily, not only protecting Germany but also protecting Italy's territory.</p>
<p>Betraying Faith is Unforgivable</p>
<p>The leaders of Italy decided to destroy the alliance, causing Italy to become a battlefield. There may be many reasons, but it is unforgivable that they acted alone without informing their allies. On the day the armistice agreement was signed, Badoglio even told the German chargé d'affaires that he would never betray Germany and that Italy had no intention of surrendering. However, an hour later, his treacherous actions were publicly announced. The claim that the Italian Chief of Staff had informed the German military representatives about this matter is merely British propaganda. Within two years, the Germans had truly understood the development of this betrayal and treachery, and they had fully understood the true intentions of the change of government. The German army had already taken all necessary measures in response to the actions of the Italians. People's war is extremely sacred, because the defeated will be destroyed, and only the victorious have the hope of survival. Therefore, we have decided to take all steps to crush the enemy.</p>
<p>Personal Life Long Forgotten</p>
<p>Italy's withdrawal from the Axis has little significance in terms of military essentials. Germany is determined to continue fighting. It is a great mistake for the enemy to think that they can use the same methods against the Germans as they did against the Italians. It is impossible to create another July 25th in Germany. I have long ceased to care about my personal life, and what I value is the security of the nation for hundreds of years to come. I once told the parliament that neither time nor force in the world can destroy Germany. What the enemy can do now is to use terrifying air raids. Not only are we using mechanical means to break this offensive, but we have also made even stronger retaliations. For strategic reasons, we may be forced to abandon certain strongholds, but the steel ring made by the blood of the German army cannot be broken. The German people should have the ability to be confident and self-reliant. The Italian incident has proceeded according to plan. The lesson of the Yugoslav rebellion can provide an excellent example for countries that are currently allied with Germany.</p>
<h3>The Fifth Year of the European War: A Review of the Internal and External Situation of Various Countries (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>This war is a world war. From a geographical perspective, it is divided into two different battlefields, Europe and East Asia, but in essence, it is one war. Purely from a military point of view, once the victory or defeat of either Europe or East Asia is decided, it will naturally have a decisive impact on the other battlefield. From a post-world view, there are two major ideals: the construction of a New Order in Greater East Asia with Japan as the leader, and the construction of a New Order in Europe with Europe as the leader. War inevitably broke out between these two and the Anglo-Americans who hindered and suppressed these ideals. Neither side can stop before achieving these ideals, even if they encounter setbacks in China.</p>
<p>The Main Battlefield is Still on the Eastern Front</p>
<p>Germany began fighting the Soviet Union two years ago, and to this day, it is difficult to predict when the military resolution will come. Even the German authorities have repeatedly stated this. In terms of mobilized troops and other factors, the main battlefield for Germany today is still the Eastern Front. The view of the Soviet battlefield, which determines the entire war situation, is an unshakable fact. Assuming that the strength of the Soviet Union has been exhausted before this winter, Germany will withdraw most of its troops from the Eastern Front, especially the air force, to prepare for attacks from England and the United States, and to strengthen air defense, and it is even very likely to advance and capture the British mainland.</p>
<p>The Dream of Victory</p>
<p>Before the fall of France in 1940, the war indeed progressed in favor of Germany, unexpectedly for most people. The British army was almost completely defeated in Dunkirk. At that time, everyone thought that Germany's victory was about to be completed. The Balkan War in 1941 also proceeded smoothly. Before that time, Germany was immersed in the dream of victory. This absolute view of victory more or less had a negative effect on the German-Soviet war that began this summer. However, this view of victory seemed to prevail even in the battles between Germany and the Soviet Union. It was not until the winter of 1941, when Germany encountered unexpected severe cold and fell into a difficult situation, that it deeply realized that it was a war that was not only different in scale but also in nature from the war against France.</p>
<p>Increased Pressure from England and the United States</p>
<p>In 1942, Germany once again launched attacks towards Ukraine and the Caucasus. In the winter of that year, there was a Soviet winter offensive. From the beginning of July this year, the Soviet Union launched another offensive between Orel and Belgorod. During this period, in December 1941, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War made the United States, which had already been virtually an enemy country, a de facto enemy of Germany and Italy. The pressure from England and the United States gradually increased from the southwest. In the fall of 1942, they landed in North Africa. Soon, they succeeded in attacking Tunisia. However, the establishment of a second front that could reduce the burden on the Soviet Union has not yet been realized.</p>
<p>The indiscriminate air raids by England and the United States against Germany and Italy, which brutally massacre women and children and destroy cultural facilities, are barbaric acts that are left aside for the moment, but the impact they have on the people of Germany and Italy, both mentally and materially, cannot be ignored. However, the result is that this cannot be said to be a decisive factor in the war.</p>
<p>Stable Domestic Situation</p>
<p>In terms of the domestic situation, the political control of National Socialism is extremely stable, and there is no danger of fissures arising from within and expanding and organizing, as happened during the previous World War. To calm the social unrest that may be caused by enemy air raids, Commander of the Guards Himmler also serves as Minister of the Interior, strengthening his authority to suppress it. In terms of the most important food supply, a consistent "thin and long" strategy is still adopted. Neither the soldiers on the front lines nor the general public in the rear feel full or hungry. The general public endures all kinds of unfreedom and inconvenience and continues the war unyieldingly. From this perspective, even if Germany cannot defeat the enemy's combat power, it has already inflicted painful blows on the enemy in this summer's battle, and will continue to strike the enemy in the future. Therefore, if Germany can shift its forces to the southwest, it will, as mentioned earlier, transform today's defensive posture, take an offensive posture, and prevent the enemy.

<p>Difficulties with Orphans' Living Expenses</p>
<p>Over 40 orphanages in this city have experienced difficulties in maintaining the living expenses of 8,000 orphans in the past two months due to the increase in sugar prices. The relief funds obtained solely from the public and the authorities are far from sufficient to maintain their livelihoods in the future. It is said that the China Philanthropic Association for Children has allocated 45,000 Yuan from the First District Public Office, but continued public assistance is still needed, as each orphanage currently needs 10,000 Yuan for food alone, not including other expenses such as medical care.</p>
<p>Two Jin of Flour Per Person in the Fourth District</p>
<p>The 15th period of household flour for the Fourth District of this city has been fully issued and distributed by the Joint Office of the District Public Office. It has been decided to begin general sales today. At that time, citizens within the district can purchase two 'shi jin' of No. 2 flour for 14 Yuan each with their 15th-period flour purchase certificates.</p>
<p>Allocated Rice Mixed with Sand and Mud</p>
<p>Central News Agency - The recent two rice allocations by the Municipal Food Bureau have both been red brown rice, and it seems to be mixed with sand and mud. Therefore, it is not only difficult to cook, but also difficult to eat. If it is re-milled, there will be a lot of loss. However, the amount of rice allocated to citizens each time is limited. The general public relies on the rice allocated by the authorities to maintain their livelihoods. However, if this continues, it will have a significant impact on the health of the people. Therefore, the general public sincerely hopes that the authorities can understand this and seek improvements to benefit the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>The Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Has Been Completed; It Will Be Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval</h3>
<p>The office of the National General Association for the Unified Control of Industry and Commerce for the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has completed the handling of the applications for export and supplementary registration of yarn and cloth from cotton yarn and cloth manufacturers and holders in the Shanghai urban area on the 6th of this month. In addition to the quantities of yarn and cloth that have been statistically registered this time, the application forms for applying to sell yarn and cloth were also completely sorted out at 5:00 PM this afternoon (11th). All categories and quantities of applications for selling yarn and cloth will be reviewed by the Commercial and Industrial Association and the Japanese Embassy, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. As for the purchase prices of various yarns and cloths, the Quality and Price Assessment Committee, jointly established by China and Japan, is continuing to conduct separate small-group meetings to determine the prices. It is expected that all prices will be determined and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and publication within the next week. It is heard that the Japanese merchants have started bundling and storing old yarns and cloths into warehouses since yesterday. In addition, the issue of distribution after the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth will be decided in the executive meeting of the Materials Control Review Committee within the next week.</p>
<h3>Match Allocation Plan Pending Approval and Implementation; Rationing System Based on Population and Tickets Will Be Adopted</h3>
<p>The long-rumored match allocation is about to become a reality. A reporter from the Commercial Press recently learned from the Match Industry Association that the detailed plan for match allocation has been completed by the association and is currently being reviewed by the relevant authorities. Once approved, it will be implemented immediately. As for the allocation method, in order to eliminate malpractices, a rationing system based on population and tickets will be adopted. Purchase certificates will be distributed according to the household registration of the Baojia system. Citizens can use the certificates to collect goods at designated retail stores. Although the allocation quantity has not been officially determined, it will be sufficient to meet the legitimate daily needs of citizens. All procedures have been completed by the association, and they are waiting for the authorities to approve it.</p>

<h3>First District Public Office Strictly Prohibits Subordinate Staff from Extortion</h3>
<p>In order to prevent improper behavior by staff, the First District Public Office specially ordered all external staff of its subordinate offices to be friendly to the merchants and people directly governed when performing their duties within the First District, and must not have any intention of being arrogant. Even if any progress is discovered in the merchants and people, it must be reported to the competent officer in accordance with the regulations, and then handled after review. No extortion is allowed, or private settlements with money. If any of the above occurs, in addition to allowing the parties to report to the District Public Office at any time, personnel have been dispatched for secret investigations. Once the facts are verified, no leniency will be shown.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Starting from Stickers</h3>
<p>Recently, the glass of shops along various roads has been covered with various stickers. Why are stickers needed? How should stickers be applied? We will not discuss this for the time being. What we want to say is: the forms and patterns of the stickers vary. Some are meticulous and painstaking, inlaid into meaningful advertisements, such as sports equipment companies, which paste paper strips into the form of tennis rackets, and music companies, which paste rows of staff paper. What we consider most meaningful is the four large characters "Time Problems" pasted on the window of a certain clock shop. They seem to give us an alert: "How precious is time!" However, there are also many that are crudely made, distorted, scribbled, and absolutely devoid of art.</p>
<p>This cannot but arouse some thoughts in us: those thin paper strips, with different forms, represent not only the so-called "appearance" on the surface, but also the different personalities, artistic senses, and abilities of countless managers and shopkeepers. In short, the form of the stickers, if they are neat and exquisite, also indicates that the person in charge is serious in handling affairs, and thinks of being better than others even in the details. They must be the winners in the industry. The Christian classics say, "He who is faithful in little things is faithful also in much!"</p>
<p>From this sticker application, we infer from the small to the large. Society and the country are no exception. Therefore, whether the social leaders and the national ruling authorities are responsible and serious can be seen from all aspects of this society and this country. In other words, the face of a society and a country can reflect whether the leaders and the ruling authorities are using the right people.</p>

<h3>Movement of Scrap Cloth, Broken Flannel, and Old Wool Yarn Is Not Restricted in Any Way; Permits Required for Cotton, Regardless of New or Old</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Old Goods Industry Association once sent a letter to the Commercial and Industrial Association to inquire whether permits are required for moving and transporting old scrap cloth, broken flannel, old cotton, and old wool yarn and for moving them within the city. It is now learned that the association has clearly instructed: after checking, the three items of old scrap cloth, broken flannel, and old wool yarn, if they are indeed old bedding materials, whether transported out of the Shanghai area or transported into Shanghai or other districts, or moved within this city, do not require permission from this association. As for cotton, regardless of whether it is new or old, bringing it into the Shanghai area requires permission from this association, and moving it within the district is subject to restrictions.</p>
<p>Comments from Economic Circles</p>
<h3>The Mentality of Shanghai's Economic Circles</h3>
<p>Regarding the surrender of the Badoglio government and the determination of Shanghai's economic figures, Mr. Aoki Takashi, Chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said in his speech yesterday: "The situation in Shanghai's economic circles is extremely calm. We should not shake our mentality due to the progress or retreat of the war situation, and at the same time, we should not waver due to the political changes in other countries."</p>
<p>Speaking of the mentality of Shanghai's economic circles, we have said before that in a certain period, the most common mentality is to see the value of goods as high and the value of currency as low, followed by the mentality of getting rich personally and not caring about national interests. We have also said that today, Shanghai's financial products market, with people's hearts consistently feeling timid and adopting a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a sluggish market, is a morbid state of mind. A morbid mentality means that the will is wavering and weak, with no enterprising spirit, and the result is nothing but self-deception.</p>
<p>"There is nothing in the world, but fools trouble themselves." This is an old Chinese saying. There is clearly nothing to worry about, but people insist on adopting the mentality of "the man of Qi worrying about the sky," resulting in "suspiciousness." As a result of the mentality, it is as if factories are about to run out of raw materials or factories are about to be unable to start work. Under a decisive policy of promoting production and stabilizing people's livelihoods in wartime, how can such a mentality of "giving up eating because of choking" be allowed to exist? Besides, there is no need to talk about "choking" at all.</p>
<p>Since the economic situation in Shanghai is extremely calm, then the mentality of Shanghai's economic figures should be calm at all times, and they should continue to work hard to move towards production, and not "trouble themselves," lest they mislead their future.</p>

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Members' Meeting Scheduled for the 26th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its 12th joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, chaired by Yuan Ludeng. First, a report was given on the full list of personnel for the Chamber's Wusong office. It was resolved to hire He Zhenya and Geng Hanchen to temporarily handle the affairs and begin operations. According to the regulations, the Chamber's annual general meeting of members should be held in mid-June each year. Previously, due to the various trade associations in the city being ordered to merge and reorganize, there were frequent changes, making it difficult to convene the meeting. The 10th joint meeting of standing directors and supervisors resolved to postpone the meeting, which was recorded in the minutes. Now that the various trade associations in the city have been largely reorganized by the competent authorities and have registered to join the Chamber, it is proposed to convene a general meeting this month. A draft of the Chamber's work report has been prepared for instructions and discussion. It was resolved to hold the meeting at 2 PM on the 26th of this month in the Chamber's auditorium. Regarding the issue of whether membership certificates of various trade associations should continue to be exempted from affixing stamp duty, a decision was requested. It was resolved to follow the Ministry of Finance's instructions and notify all trade associations to comply.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Convenes Sino-Japanese Economic Conference</h3>

<p>Ministries of Food and Real Estate Issue Order to Establish</p>
<p>Production Cooperative Mutual Aid Societies</p>
<p>An order from the Ministries of Food and Real Estate states: "The effectiveness of cooperative undertakings originally lies in regulating civilian finance, promoting public production, and also controlling distribution to eliminate corruption. It is truly a good policy for improving the economic lives of civilians and implementing a controlled economy. Our ministries, mindful of this, are solely finding ways to promote it. Currently, the rural loan business has been launched. In order to broadly promote and solicit local production businesses to rise up, the original cooperative system is organized to be strict, making it difficult to promote quickly. Temporary measures for production mutual aid societies are ordered so that various places can implement them accordingly to nurture. This type of production mutual aid society can separately manage production affairs and guide members to join cooperative societies as powerful members, as the grassroots organization of cooperative affairs. These measures have now been approved by the Executive Yuan for record-keeping and were promulgated and implemented by our ministries on August 18th. In addition to issuing separate orders, a copy of the temporary measures for production mutual aid societies is enclosed for your provincial government's registration and for instructing your subordinates to comply accordingly."</p>
<p>Hua Stock Trends</p>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks fluctuated constantly, with two drops being immediately recovered. The situation after the noon closing was particularly tight. However, the initial decline encountered resistance, and the price was uniformly lower than the previous day. People's minds were uncertain, and transaction volume decreased significantly. Financial circles and major players were still watching. The department store sector was the weakest initially. Wing On twice sharply declined and then recovered. After the noon closing, demand exceeded supply and suddenly rose, but was still lower than the previous day. Sincere, National Goods, and Lihua three companies declined more significantly. China Underwear also declined sharply. King Fook Shirts and Socks saw lower prices again. The decline in textiles was limited. Wing On Textiles reduced prices slightly. After the noon closing, there were buyers. Dasheng lost 1.32, Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving, Guangqin, and Qingfeng Textiles all sought declines. Small denomination shares declined more sharply. Zhongfang, Leihe, Wuhe, Hongxing, Hongyuan, and Da Zhonghua Weaving all saw lower prices. American Lun Mao remained weak. Xinrongye only saw Zhongxi and Zhongying remain at the original price. Wuzhou, Sino-French, Xinya, Xinyi, and Xin Xing all fell. The cultural industry's Commercial Press and Zhonghua both saw smaller price decreases. Yongxiang, Donggong Papermaking, and Standard Paper Products were quoted at the original price, with few transactions. The utilities sector was stable. China General Edison rose. Zhabei Water and Electricity, Public Motor, and Xiang Sheng Tricycle had little change. Mainland Tap Water, China Xing Coal Mine, Hanyeping, and Qing Shao Shipping's reduction in value was similar to the previous two days. China and Hua Cement were both weak. Da Zhonghua Firerock declined significantly. Huacheng Tobacco's demand and supply prices did not converge, with few transactions. Nanyang Tobacco Company entered the ranks. China Hua Oil reported stable weakness. Home Industry sang. Sanyou Industrial remained flat. China Rubber suddenly saw a decline. The industrial sector was the weakest. Jiu An, Xinghua, and Da Zhonghua Industrial were all sharply declining. Xin Ya Construction was also seen declining. Real estate declines were limited. Xin Yi. Tuohua. Yongxing's small plates were limited. Baoan Glass was uniquely flat. Meilin Canned Goods. Sosheng buyers quoted lower prices. Zhunwei MSG and Fumin Dairy Products remained deadlocked. Dahua accumulated stocks and Zhong planned to weave a level market. Jin Bang Industry also declined, with only Zhongyi seeing little change. Dalu, Shanghai, Zhejiang Xing, Jin Cheng, and industry banks all showed weakness.</p>
<p>Business Summary</p>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday's unified government bond market started with a firm sentiment. However, there were many sellers in the middle, and the market turned weak as a result, but it rebounded until noon. As a result, Type C rose two grades, and Types A, B, D, and E also saw significant increases. All other bonds also opened higher.</p>
<p>Rice: The rice market had limited sources, but the stock was still abundant. Retail transactions were slow, and retail investors were not interested. Because the Mid-Autumn Festival was approaching, there was no stock, and late rice fell. There was no honor or disgrace for new rice. Few du soybeans arrived, and the black market was stable.</p>
<p>Wool: Since the supply from Australia was cut off, this city is quite lacking. The existing stock has been almost completely collected. Woolen fabric manufacturers have switched to using North China and Zhejiang-Hubei wool, but the domestic product is not cheaper than the imported product. The quality is coarse and can only be used to weave coarse wool products. In addition, due to transportation and control issues, the goods are also scarce. However, recently, North China goods have remained firm, while Zhejiang-Hubei goods have felt light because their quality and uses are different.</p>
<p>Tea: The market trend can be called peaceful, but buyers' appetites are difficult to open, resulting in a lack of significant progress in transactions. Only this street in the city has selectively added a little dyeing, and the supply is also balanced, so the market price is rarely volatile. In short, due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, both buyers and sellers are busy sorting out their accounts, so they are unwilling to accept or hand over.</p>
<h3>A Quick Sketch of the Shanghai Charity and Relief Association: A Shelter for the Elderly, Disabled, Widowed, and Orphans</h3>
<p>Cries for urgent help echo from the muddy ground and straw sheds</p>
<p>Except for the occasional passing cart, few upper-class citizens frequent the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road. At the southern end of the "New Yamen" (government office), there is a pile of old, dilapidated low houses standing on the wide road paved with gravel. From afar, one can see the broken roofs of several shanty dwellings. Approaching the low houses, one can see that the door facing east clearly bears the sign "Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Association Relief Home"! It is said that this is the largest charity organization run by the Chinese in Shanghai!</p>
<p>A Tour of the Charity Relief Home</p>
<p>Stepping through the gate, oh! It turns out to be a wasteland, originally the former cemetery! On this uneven wasteland, the most conspicuous are the several straw sheds in front on the right side. Ravaged by a recent wind and rainstorm, they look as if their eyes have been gouged out, ears cut off, limbs severed. No! They are simply crumbling skeletons! Where is there any human breath here? Who would believe that this is a corner of Shanghai, a prosperous city? What is seen before one's eyes is not the sandy battlefield described in the ancient wartime texts as "miserable and tragic, with sad winds and a bleak sun"? However, even before approaching these crumbling, skeletal shacks, one is surprised that these are precisely the groups of helpless elderly, disabled, widowed, and orphaned living inside!</p>
<p>This is the main undertaking of the Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Association: the Charity Relief Home. These shacks are divided into four sections: elderly, disabled, orphaned, and widowed.</p>
<p>The elderly section currently occupies a large shack. At the entrance, there is a small house for the manager, which is relatively intact. The blackboard states that it accommodates 76 elderly men and women over the age of 60. It is evident that the original scale and organization were meticulous. Several elderly people are curled up or lying on the ground and upper bunks, each with their own ragged and filthy quilt and mat. The heavy rain and wind have left traces of coolness. The upper bunks allow free passage of wind and clouds. Although the lower level has a floor, it is broken and full of holes. It is lunchtime, and several are scooping up porridge to eat, chanting "Amitabha," expressing their gratitude to the providers.</p>
<p>The disabled section occupies another large shack even more dilapidated than the people. It states that it currently houses 97 people. The conditions inside are the same as in the elderly section. The heavy rain and wind have created mud in the indoor walkways. To support the shack and prevent it from collapsing, many diagonal pillars are propped up inside. Anyone passing through the aisle must bend over and squeeze through again and again. Branches from the roof will be blown onto your head by the wind, and one careless step will make you fall. But the disabled are content, and the suffering of begging on the streets makes them feel that this place is already paradise.</p>
<p>Orphan and Widow Sections and Children's Education Center</p>
<p>The widow section houses widows and their children among the refugees, said to number as many as 273. The shack they occupy, although equally dilapidated, is being worked on by the widows, who are more capable than the elderly over 60 and the disabled, to repair it after the storm. A refugee from Guangdong is helping her child clean and repair their bunk. Some of the bunks are separated by straw mats, and there are even thermos bottles, utensils, and their own bedding. Some are already eating white rice porridge with pickled bean curd, enjoying it heartily. Others are cutting pumpkins on their bunks, preparing lunch. Although most are dressed in rags and exposing flesh, some are dressed relatively neatly because they go outside to "work" and earn some meager income.</p>
<p>The orphan section is the largest, with four shacks originally. Two are workshops and "classrooms," and the other two are bedrooms. The workshops mainly produce net bags and white gloves (for workers). Especially the net bags, they use better materials and make them more delicately, larger and sturdier than those seen in the market. They are sold to major companies. Seeing these products, no one would think that they are made by the hands of orphans who lack food and clothing! Look, how neatly and beautifully they are knotted!</p>
<p>Now, the orphans' shacks have also been destroyed by the storm. The workshop has been suspended. 89 orphans are crowded into a relatively intact shack. However, the roof and walls cannot withstand the invasion of wind and rain!</p>
<p>To the left of the entrance is the Tzu Chi Children's Education Center, which is smaller in scope and the buildings are relatively more intact, but there are still signs of mess, dirt, and mud after the storm. The children's homes, utensils, and tableware are things that people dare not touch with their hands, and perhaps dare not even look at directly. However, the children live vigorously. It is noon, the boys have already washed the tableware, and the children in the small courtyard are knitting woolen sweaters and the like, which the education center accepts as orders from the outside world. The boys' clothes are relatively worse, and the girls are still quite neat, like the children of middle and lower-class families. (Continued on page 4)</p>

<h3>Shen Bao's Letter to the Industrial and Commercial Community</h3>
<p>To the esteemed members of the industrial and commercial community: Shanghai's industrial and commercial enterprises have always been known for their prosperity. In the past, there were specialized publications such as credit directories, which were convenient for reference. In recent years, there have been many new establishments and changes, but there is still a lack of detailed investigation and systematic recording. Moreover, due to the high cost of paper and labor, few new editions have been published, making inspection and reference inconvenient. In view of this, our newspaper plans to start compiling a "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Directory" to collect extensive information and ensure accurate investigation. We have received much assistance from various trade associations and individuals in the industrial and commercial sectors, who have either provided information or introduced us to sources. However, since our newspaper's purpose in compiling this directory is to facilitate reference for the industrial and commercial community, we strive to ensure that the investigation and recording are as detailed and accurate as possible. Therefore, we hereby issue another public notice, requesting all factories, workshops, companies, and firms in this city (regardless of capital size or business scope, all industrial and commercial enterprises are welcome) to provide accurate survey information. The content of the information should mainly include the following items: Name, Address, Telephone, Telegraph, and Mailbox, Date of Establishment, Organization (Company, Partnership, Sole Proprietorship, etc.), Type of Business, Names of Key Personnel such as Chairman, Directors, Supervisors, Managers, Deputy Managers, Factory Directors, Directors, etc., Shop Owner, Shareholders, etc. Please provide detailed information for each item and send it directly to our newspaper's "Industrial and Commercial Directory Information Department" so that it can be included accordingly. From our newspaper's standpoint, this will achieve the goal of being detailed and accurate. From the standpoint of industry and commerce, it will not only indirectly promote nutrition but also gain recognition from all sectors, which is tantamount to a free advertisement. We are confident that people in all industries and businesses will understand this and be happy to assist. With printing imminent, please fill out and submit the information as soon as possible. Sincerely, Shen Bao</p>

<h3>19 Primary and Secondary Schools Respond to Organize Teachers and Staff Consumer Cooperatives</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Jiang Tong advocated organizing consumer cooperatives for teachers and staff to solve the problem of various material needs in life, teachers and society have risen up to offer suggestions and study them in detail, which shows the need for such an organization.</p>
<p>Education is the foundation of a country, and the mission of our teachers is extremely arduous. However, at present, teachers and staff are under the high pressure of prices. All day long, what they get is not enough to eat. Whether it is supporting their parents or raising their children, some say that at a time when the country is facing unprecedented difficulties, the people should all practice frugality and frugality to strengthen national power and cope with the crisis. The principle is indeed normal. However, it is difficult to be fair and just. Our teachers and staff are under tremendous hardship. Those who sympathize in the society often encourage them with the words "noble and clean", and they themselves often comfort themselves with "noble and clean". However, whenever they are hungry, they really feel non-laughing. However, this kind of spirit of serving the country and society cannot be achieved by a profession.</p>
<p>Now that the pioneers of our education community have advocated cooperation to solve the problem of their own lives through their own organizations, this is indeed very important. Since our own needs have not been advocated first, we should respond later, hoping that our education members will quickly rise up to organize and see the results as soon as possible. It is very fortunate!</p>

<h3>Citizens Yearn for Household Oil</h3>
<p>— Qiang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The news has come that the sixth term of household sugar, although said to be late, has actually been allocated. Although the quantity is small, it is better than painting a cake to satisfy hunger. The so-called: "Better than nothing", and the price remains unchanged, which is the painstaking effort of the authorities and is also celebrated by the citizens. But "cooking oil", which is more important than sugar, is still out of reach and there is no trace of it! Forbearance makes citizens look forward to it. Is "cooking oil" really scarce? But it doesn't seem to be. Private sellers carrying oil buckets in the streets and the rumbling breweries, secretly out-of-the-way black market oil (soybean oil, raw oil) shout the price. Exceptionally rampant This is not the family of the middle and lower classes, right? (No purchasing power.) The first term of household oil issued to citizens by the former Public Works Bureau has not been used for half a year. Now that the rent has been recovered, all the people look forward to it. I hope that the authorities will quickly practice "counting the mouths and training" to lower the price limit and allocate it immediately, so that the people will not have vegetables and lack nutrition and the people will not be resentful.</p>

<h3>Buddha Hall, Clinic, and Workshop</h3>
<p>Within the Charity United Hospital, there is a Buddha hall, the most orderly and cleanest place in the entire compound. The scene is not much different from ordinary small temples. It is a pity that there is no permanent person in charge, so detailed inquiries cannot be made. Only a male tailor, whose hearing seemed not very clear and reluctant to see people, was working there. On the big bell at the entrance of the hall, a list of names of great benefactors was written. It is said that every morning someone strikes the bell and chants scriptures as a "morning lesson," which is probably the main educational activity.</p>
<p>For the orphans, it is said that there used to be informal education, divided into six levels. They worked in the morning and studied in the afternoon, but it was discontinued due to financial difficulties. Now, perhaps also due to the devastation of the recent storm, only a few roof frames remain of the classroom. Therefore, it is impossible to visit the teachers, which is a real pity. As for the "Children's Education Center," it has a school-like structure in terms of scale. Unfortunately, it was visited several days after the storm, and formal educational facilities had not yet been restored!</p>
<p>It is said that great attention is paid to the lives of the elderly, disabled, orphans, and widows. Director Qian of the General Affairs Department introduced us to a shed labeled as a clinic, which contained a few tables and a large cabinet displaying some medicines. It was said that a Chinese medicine doctor, Xu, regularly came for diagnosis and treatment, and two nurses were constantly in the hospital to take care of them. Next to it was a ward where several female patients were ordering attendants to do minor things like adding porridge, which seemed to indicate their status. Everything in the ward was indeed much better than the living conditions of the elderly, disabled, orphans, and widows.</p>
<p>Attached to the hospital is a "Joint Workshop Cooperative," which is actually a toy factory. Its main products are wooden toys, such as pistols, tanks, cars, dogs, etc. The equipment is complete, the work is intense, and it is full of vigor, making it a profit-generating organization. However, apart from absorbing a small number of orphans and widows from the hospital as workers, it seems to have no direct affiliation with the Charity United Association, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Looking Back and Looking Forward</p>
<p>Such is the general situation of the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association. However, the association is indeed of great significance to Shanghai society. The elderly, disabled, orphans, and widows it accommodates were all left behind during the war in Shanghai. In the past, they almost all had happy families. Many men and women had received proper education. When the war broke out, they abandoned their homes and fled into the Shanghai concessions. Because of their honesty and lack of speculative skills, they pathetically sought refuge in various refugee shelters. After February of the previous year, the situation in Shanghai changed, and shortly thereafter, there was a food shortage. At the same time, society gradually stabilized, so the refugee shelters were officially dissolved in the spring of last year. However, at that time, the homeless, elderly, sick, disabled, orphans, and widows were almost in a desperate situation. Compassion is in everyone's heart. Philanthropist Wen Longting made every effort to assist in transferring those who could not be repatriated when the refugee shelters were closed to the Charity United Relief Association to establish this Charity United Nursing Home. In order to rescue poor children who had mothers but were unable to raise them, he joined forces with the Chinese Jisheng Food Company to establish the Charity Children's Education Center. From the beginning of the reorganization of the Nursing Home in April of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession was responsible for providing supplies for three months, totaling 100,000 yuan. The amount exceeding this was supplemented by the Charity Relief Association. After July, all expenses were entirely borne by the Charity Relief Association. However, the association itself had no funds or assets, and the donations it received had to cover other expenses, so it could not be used exclusively for the Nursing Home, resulting in extreme financial difficulties. Later, the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association was established, and an application for subsidies was submitted. Commissioner Yonghua went to investigate and believed that there was an urgent need for subsidies. From February of this year, the Nursing Home was subsidized with 12,000 yuan per month, and the Education Center with 4,000 yuan per month, totaling 96,000 yuan until June. In August of this year, another subsidy of 30,000 yuan for the Nursing Home and 9,000 yuan for the Education Center was provided. However, due to the small amount of general donations and the rising prices and increased expenses, the Nursing Home currently accommodates a total of 545 elderly, disabled, orphans, and widows, with 20 staff members and 64 workers, totaling 619 people. Each person receives rice twice a day, 5.3 taels each time, requiring more than 10,000 catties per month. The Education Center accommodates 265 disaster-stricken children, with fewer workers, but the expenses are also considerable. As for the general workers, they are completely embracing the spirit of sacrifice and service, with everyone having the spirit of "I will go to hell for others." Their salaries are no more than 240 yuan at the highest, and the workers are paid only 12 yuan! Their living conditions are almost the same as the refugees. Many staff members' families have also been incorporated into the refugee team because they cannot make a living! They are seeking benevolence and finding it, enduring hardship without complaint. However, how can enthusiastic people in society bear to see them constantly in hardship, especially at present, with the sheds collapsing or on the verge of collapse, unable to shield them from wind and rain? If a large amount of money is not immediately raised to renovate them, then the autumn rains and winter winds will inevitably cause these nearly a thousand lives to freeze and starve to death. This will make people lose confidence in charitable undertakings. We earnestly hope that people with the power in society will rise up to assist, and those with resources will provide assistance!</p>

<h3>China Health Association Expands Medical Services</h3>
<p>Health is the foundation of life and career, and also the fundamental force for all construction in the country and society. All countries in the world are vigorously promoting health care systems to maintain the health of their citizens, with remarkable results. Our country has always paid attention to this. Enthusiastic people in society deeply feel the seriousness of the current livelihood and medical problems, and believe that there is an urgent need to take action. Therefore, the China Health Association was organized to actively promote preventive health care work for citizens.</p>
<p>The association adapts to the needs of society, concentrates all the latest hospital treatment equipment, establishes a large-scale medical service organization, and, according to the most advanced health care policies of various countries, first divides the guidance and service departments as follows: those belonging to nutrition guidance include the food and beauty department; those belonging to prevention and inspection include the pathology and chemical examination department and the blood pressure examination department, trachoma examination department, and tuberculosis prevention movement department; those belonging to rescue and protection include the tuberculosis rescue department, the poor and sick relief department, and the smoking and opium cessation department; those belonging to women and children's health care include the women and children's health care department, etc. In the future, teachers and cultural figures from middle schools holding certificates from this association for health check-ups will be served and treated faithfully and cooperatively by doctors from various departments. The association's address is the Majestic Building, Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<h3>Zeng De Yi School</h3>
<p>The Zeng De Yi School has been increased with a commercial part-time compulsory night school. The site has been found at Guangyi Middle School, 270 Chengdu Road (north of Weihaiwei Road). The level ranges from the fifth grade of elementary school to the third grade of junior high school. Four classes are temporarily set up. The curriculum focuses on commercial knowledge and skills. Tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived. A deposit is slightly collected (those who are guaranteed by formal commercial firms and factories are exempt from payment). Aspiring students can go to register from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM or from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM every day from now on. Old students should also go to complete the enrollment registration procedures. Students who were not admitted to the subsidy this year can also take the exam.</p>
<h3>Fang Shentong's Calligraphy and Painting Charity Sale Preview</h3>
<p>— Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>Fang Shentong, I heard, is the younger brother of Mr. Zijun from my hometown. He is thirteen years old and studies in high school. In his spare time, he learns calligraphy from Mr. Li Renzhangjian. His writing includes various styles such as cursive, seal, and official script. His ink works are all excellent. Now, he is using his spare time to create more than 200 pieces of calligraphy and painting, all of which will be donated to the Shanghai Children's Shelter to supplement its operating expenses. His enthusiasm for promoting children's education is also admirable. It is now scheduled to hold a charity sale at the Ningbo Fellow Association from the 12th of this month. There will surely be a grand occasion. Therefore, I wrote a poem to him: Once read the landscape painting of Shanyin, the three perfections of art talk about Fang Chan. Looking at the divine child through the ages, dancing snake is not alone. Zhang Dian's drunken Su mixed chapters, ink dripping, how many lines of words. Not only is Wang Youjun's style still there, but the Han official script is also in one furnace.</p>
