<h3 id="c1">元旦的願望 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>今天是中華民國成立第三十二個元旦。</p>
<p>三十二年了。一個人到了三十二歲，該是振作有爲　壯年時期了，他將如春夏之交，花木繫茂，萬物向榮，充滿了滋長的朝氣，洋溢着愉快的情緒。然而，我們回顧我們的國家，三十二年來，那一樣値得我們滿足？那一樣値得我們愉快？特別是近幾年來，我們是踏進了更艱苦更困難的時代，我們担負　更艱鉅而沉重的責任。此時，我們大家都只能增加任重道遠的警惕，都只能增加對國家對社會的則重之感，那裏來狂歡慶祝的心緒？那要來歌功頸德的閒情逸緻？我們相信，這不僅是本報的態度，一定正是全國同胞共有的心情吧。因此，我們亦這民國三十二年的元旦，敬以十分嚴肅，緊張和誠摯的心，寫出一點小小的願望。</p>
<p>第一，我們願望國入正　現實，正視戰爭的現實，不要再在虛浮的歌舞昇平之中醉生夢死。現在的戰爭，大東亞戰爭，是決定東亞各民族命運的戰爭，也是慘酷的長期的戰爭，爲着這個偉大戰爭之勝利，需要每一個東亞人民都能自動的奮鬥。因此，我們每一個人都要作更艱苦的準備，才能爭取最後的勝利。也因此，一切太平觀念，一切享樂心理，一切貪天之功的妄想，都要快快收拾起來。從　年今日起，發奮振作。迎接我們光榮的東亞民族解放戰爭的勝利。</p>
<p>第二，我們期望中民間之親善關係，眞眞實實的更進一歩，更期望中日軍民之間的相互關係，向眞正諒解與互助的目標更進一歩。本來，中日是同文同種東惡民族，大家都不應表面親善而內存猜忌之心，因爲合作則共存，分離則共亡，已是一定的眞理。特別是從大東亞戰爭以來，中日友好關係，更奠定了了小可動搖的基礎，大家更　彼此諒解與互助，大家更應不咎既往，不再吹毛求疵，不再發生有妨雙方感情的</p>
<p>第三，我們願望人民的生活，特別是糧食問題和一般物價問題，獲得合理的解決，大家不必再爲日常生活的瑣事而耗費精力，以致再無餘力以盡忠於國家民族。以協助友邦日本爭取大東亞戰爭的勝利，上海的糧食問題，我們在去年年底，曾一再撰評，並且特闢專欄，發表各方面人民的意見和要求。大家的意思，都要求當局增加戶口米的數量，當局對此，也很注意，因此，在最近一期的戶口米糧中，已稍稍增加了一些。當局這種重視民間公意的精神，實在値得欽佩。不過所增還嫌太少，我們乘此歲首，願望增加到人民足够維持生活的程度，更進而達到安定民生的最大目標。</p>
<p>今天我們不暇爲歌功頌德的媚世之空文，我們不能作漫無把握的欺世之預言，我們只能嚴肅而誠摯地指出戰時的任務之艱鉅，指出我們肩頭責任的沈重和前程的遼遠，我們寫出這幾點小小的預望，雖然「卑之無高」，却也是當前大家最迫切的期待，我們希望大家」勿以善小而不爲，勿以惡小而爲之」，大家能在這空前艱苦中站得住，那麼，中華民國的前途就一定是光明無限的，大東亞戰爭　勝利可以操左券的，而明年今日我們就可以狂歡。</p>

<h3 id="c13">今年新國民運動之重點 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 汪精衛</p>
<p>——三十二年元旦——</p>
<p>去年元旦、我曾頒布新國民運動綱要、期於人人自己實行、相與寳行、並且爲有組織、有紀律的實行、庶幾鍛鍊成新的人格、以擔負新的時代之新的使命、今年仍當本此綱要、加緊實行、務使新國民運動的精神更加深刻化、普遍化、同時還要使此精神集中於以下三點、</p>
<p>第一、協力大東亞戰爭、大東亞戰爭是整個東亞民族安危生死的關頭、中國是東亞的一部分、決沒有東亞危、而中國獨安、東亞亡而中國獨存的道理、中國在去年的一年、已以同甘共苦的精神、貢獻於大東亞戰爭、今年的一年、將更進一步以同安共危同生共死的精神、使大東亞戰爭得到最後勝利、</p>
<p>第二、保障治安、就大東亞戰爭的局勢看來、國民政府統治下的地方是後方、同時也是前綫、這話怎麽講呢、日本舉其海陸空軍的力量、向着英美展開空前的鬥爭、中國處在後方的地位、應該負後方的責任、可是英華所慣用的是以東亞人殺東亞人的政策、大東亞戰爭一開始、即勾引渝方出兵緬甸、這樣利用東亞人做前哨、做別動隊、來和東亞人自相殘殺的手段、在英美眞是歹毒到了極點、此外還勾引渝方、隨處以游擊戰來牽制日本在中國駐屯着的軍隊、欲使日本不能以其全部力量使用於大東亞戰爭的前綫、同時不斷的侵擾和平區、欲使和平區內一切建設無從着手、他們一面高唱「日本不撤兵不談和平」、一面用盡方法使日本撤兵無從實現、就這一點看來、我們對於英美郤是站在前綫的地位、我們必須在和平區內整理起一條東亞同志的陣綫、使英美所嗾使的走狗無所施其侵擾、然後和平區內的一切建設方才可以着手、而所謂保陣治安其意義亦即在於此、</p>
<p>第三、增加生產、就一般說、平均分配、節約消費與增加生產三者並重、增加生產還是三者之中的一個重點、今年的一年、政府要拿着全副精神來謀生產組織之加强、生產方法之改良、生產工具之獲得及利用、人民也要拿著全副精神、來從事奮鬥、盼望一般同胞注默到此、以儉報國、尤其以勤報國、</p>
<p>以上所說、和前年元旦的保障治安、改善民生意義雖差不多、而實在是逃一步、因爲今年的一年我們所有的努力、都應該置重在協力大東亞戰爭這一點上、盼望一般同胞、提起新國民運動的精神、來擔當新時代的新使命、</p>
<h3 id="c14">新年獻詞 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>日駐華大使重光葵</p>
<p>當此大東亞戰爭下第二年元旦之時、東亞英美勢力、已因日本將士之忠勇奮戰而完全淸除、東亞已於桎梏之中獲得解放、南北亘三千里之廣大東亞全域、已呈現民族協和復興建設之祥　、</p>
<p>我友邦中華民國於汪主席領導之下、本同甘共苦之精神、力向復興中國、保衛東亞之標的巡進、最近在主席更親蒞日本、乃使中日關係更趨緊密、而國民政府之强化發展、以及大東亞戰爭之完成、亦胥因此即可實現、思之誠堪慶幸之至、</p>

<h3 id="c15">上海市清鄉的回顧與前瞻 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 陳公博</p>
<p>歲月不居、中華民國三十二年又降臨人間、隨著歲序的更新、不論政府人民、對今後自應有一番新約計劃、對過去該作一次總的回顧、</p>
<p>國民政府爲了確立地方治安、切實改善民生、使局部和平逐漸擴展、早日實現中日全面和平起見、從前年七月、成立了淸鄉委員會、到今天已整整一年有半了、淸鄉工作已在廣大區域展開、並收獲了滿意的成績、</p>
<p>第一、上海淸鄉的特徵、上海市區並無大股游匪存在、間有零星匪共、或爲盲從，或受要脅、擾亂地方、原非本心、淸鄉一經發動、此項力量微弱之匪共、是不難在短時期內掃蕩廓淸的、其根本要着、厥為澄清人民思想上之亂源、所以思想清鄉為上海清鄉的第一特徵、</p>
<p>第二、上海之所以成為罪惡淵藪、使社會黑慕重重、地痞流氓之活躍、實爲主因于此次上海淸鄉對地痞流氓之淸除、倍加注意、此爲上海淸鄉特徵之二、第三、上海是中國最重要的都市、上海成爲大東亞大後方一重要據點、確立後方治安、以推進前方之勝利、爲獻身中日和平者所必具之信念、如何使百年來浸淫於英、美勢力下之上海市、一掃英、美色彩、回復東方本來面目、以重建新的大上海、此實爲上海淸鄉特微之三、</p>
<p>第四、今後工作指標、回顧了四個月來的上海清鄉、我們對於前途是樂觀的、今　要循此努力、使已做到的做得更好、未做到的要在短期內做到、茲　舉要點、作爲上海淸鄉今後的指標、今後的工作、我們還是要針對了上海淸鄉的特微而着手的</p>
<p>一、強化地方行政機構、使節政教衛一體化、提高行政效率、</p>
<p>二、鞏固地方治安、養成人民愛鄉精神、加强人民自衛力量、改善警政、嚴密警防團組織、</p>
<p>三、澈底整頓田賦稅收、確立稅收預算、增加地方建設事業經費、</p>
<p>四、擴充學校普及教育、注意質的改進、量的增加、</p>
<p>五、積極復興地方建設、舉辦社會福利事業、整頓交通、與復水利、</p>
<p>六、强化黨的下層組織、擴大微求黨員、吸收優秀份子入黨、訓練下級黨員、</p>
<p>七、勵行新運推進民運、實施新國民訓練、組織各業公會工會</p>
<h3 id="c16">新疆近況 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 季庸</p>
<p>自澳門轉來</p>
<p>筆者近赴迪化旅行，在迪逗留三週，留迪時間，迭與盛世才晤談。新疆省地下富藏，從未經多數專家實地嚴密查勘，故究竟蘊蓄質量如何，迄今尚無較爲精確之估計。據新省負責人談稱，新省富藏，實遠超一般人之估計。惟地廣人稀，至今全疆人口不過四百五十萬，故移民問題，亟待解決。盛世才語人，全疆五穀俱備，蔬菜水果無缺，腹地人民可儘速移來。但事實上因交通與水利不發展，移民問題，總難圓滿解決也。</p>
<p>宋美齡，朱紹良，翁文灝，梁寒操等近曾先後往新疆，朱紹良於半載內往返新省達四决之多。吳澤湘協助地方辦理外交事務。迪化市正圖改建，土木工程之與繁，與近年之蘭州相若。其他情形，均漸改觀，惟須待時日耳，日用品因來源不易，頗感匱之。</p>
<p>渝財政部鑒於新省為西北重鎮，並為國際交通孔道，特制定新省「流通貨幣辦法」四項，於日前電商新省府同意，並由新省公布於十一月一日起施行：（一）「中央銀行」即將在新設行，發行「關金券」，與新省省幣同時流通，並暫定「關金劵」二角五分折合新省省幣一元，凡腹地各省與新省之匯兌及新省境內公私收付，以及一切貿易，以「關金劵」收付者，均照上項定律辦理。（二）新省如需外匯，可以「關金券」申請「中央銀行」供給。（三）由「財政部」所屬機關供給新省茶糖等日用品。（四）過渡時期，省幣仍照常流通，必要時得按統一發行辦法辦理。「財政部」即派監理員駐省銀行監理。</p>
<p>新省建設事業，突飛猛進，油鑛除獨山子一處正擬大量開採及改組外，南疆××兩地，又發現油田多處，據謂以上油鑛均與高加索油田同脈。新省建設廳爲校極解決水利困難，於去年完成伊寗長九十六公里之裕農渠，可液溉伊寗，綏定，惠遠三縣農田一萬公頃以上。現又加工趕挖天山瀚海紅襲池渠道，該池距迪市十公里，位天山之巓，一望無垠，宛若雲海。筆者曾跋山參觀，恍如置身於舊小說描寫之瑤池，誠自然界之奇觀。該渠道長四十一公里，可灌田四千公頃，明年四月正式放水。將來迪化食糧可無需外縣供給。又孚康縣博克達山上之瀚海，亦動工修渠。引該渠水可灌田三千公頃。喀什區之麥蓋提之晋庸渠，亦在計劃修築中。此外，迪化又進行闢筑晋庸械化農場，為農業科學化示範。</p>
<p>敎育方面，二十七年度公立及各文化會之學校共一七六九所，學生十三萬九千九百二十六人。本年度，學校增至二四三九所，學生二十六萬八千六百八十人，連民衆學校及社會敎育機開之受敎人數，全疆四百五十萬人口中，正受敎育者在五十萬人以上，加已受敎育者可超過八十萬人。現各學校均加强國語課程，外族講漢話者日多，各校規定漢維學生生活在一起。內地所授之各種敎材新省已大量採用。</p>

<p>官商協定低價政策</p>
<p>當局為安定民生起見、將實行低物價政策、在商人方面、應設法儘量將物價抑低、在一般市民、自須竭力節制消費、至於低價政策之實行、除運用法律以外、應促進商人之自動覺悟及人民之眞誠合作、在此方面、業經設立之公會課、可望大有助力、蓋此課之設、即在促進當局與各同業公會間之關係、如官商能相互貫通、則遇事能順利推進、自必事半功倍也、</p>

<p>各代表演講</p>
<p>蒙古聯合自治政府駐日代表特克希卜彥氏</p>
<p>作爲大東亞建、設之一翼的蒙疆，因其爲推進以前進基地之故，遂負有極重大之使命，徵之日本政府屢次的聲明，這是確切不移的事實。體騐着在大東亞戰下邁着建設巨步的日本之大東亞建設之基本理念，蒙疆官民一體忍受着困苦窮乏，和日本同甘共苦，高度地發揚着作爲大陸上特殊防共前衛地域的重大的使命。鑒於這樣的情形，常常有人會加以「勃洛克主義」的誤解。然而，因爲是皇軍的駐防地域，是被任命爲大陸諸地域的「防砦」之故，這一點是必須求得各方諒解</p>
<p>爲要達成此蒙疆經濟建設之使命，各種工作必須綜合地予以推進，同時，作爲經濟的特殊地域，更必須開發並利用其重要資源，以期對日作全面的協力，同時也就是對共榮各域作極大的貢獻。</p>
<p>括要地說來，自給自足的政策，和計劃經濟之進展並强化，是最重大的一點。像蒙疆這樣的經濟處女地，經濟建設之推進比較容易，是不待言的</p>
<p>在國防經濟上說來，蒙疆也自有其特殊的經濟性格，及特殊的立地條件。以長城綫爲區分的蒙疆，越過八達嶺，就是京包綫和同蒲綫二鐵路，經濟上必爲此二鐵路綫所左右，是非常重要的事。把這些交通綱一加考慮，更使我們覺得，建立自給自足體制，是非常必要的。</p>
<p>現在，蒙疆最富足的資源，如鐵，煤，黑鉛，石棉等地下資源，羊毛，毛皮及其他輕工業原料，及雜穀等，應日本之請求，爲求全面的協力計，將一切以最低價供出，就是對華北及滿洲，鐵和煤二項，也以同樣的最低價供出。反過來，從上述地點來的輸入物，却因爲日本及華北有所謂調整費之故，不得不高價輸入。</p>
<p>因此，蒙疆的負担和犧牲是非常之大的。但是，以共榮圈經濟建設爲最大急務，我們還得咬緊牙關，忍受下去。計劃經濟仍在飛躍地進展着。舉實例來說，那就是：獸毛纖維原料之改良增產，灌溉水利，耕地開拓，品種改良，農耕指導等長畜產之改良增產，由於輕工業之發展而謀自給自足體制之確立。此外，還有通信，電氣，交通等方面顯著的發展等等。但是，如前所述，因爲經濟事情地塲資本之貧困性，域外投資之弱少，及其他許多開發運行上的障礙，經濟建設計劃還不能如期望那樣順利地完成。關於這些，我們期望日本方面的協力和支援。</p>

<h3 id="c56">「紙門松」　日本人節約精神的表現 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴我照</p>
<p>凡新年中看見有松竹裝飾的門前，就可以知道道一家住的是日本人。因爲所謂門松，是日本新年中最重要的飾物，牠是松竹梅三樣扎成，松是永存的象徵，竹是正直的表示，二者與梅配合，而放出淸幽芬芳的香氣。</p>
<p>在日本本土的日本人，往往在新年前十數天，就已着手門松的準備，而對於竹子的選擇是特別的考究。這是一家中男孩子的工作，在可能範圍內差不多要費好幾天的功夫去選擇一根最完善最直的靑竹子，再將選定的竹子，一頭劈成斜尖形，與松梅扎成一束，揷在木盆中，放在門首最顯明的地方。可是今年在上海靑竹是很難買得的，况且價値也不小，所以廿五日總力報國會提倡「必勝決戰型的紙門松」。這種紙門松是用長一尺三寸寬八寸的紙，用三色繪成門松樣子，貼在大門上，以代替現實的門松。福田民團長謂：「門松乃日本的醇美風俗，但當此大東亞戰爭時期，國民應抱自成自肅的信念，愛護物資，同時發揚日本簡素的精神，而達到最後的勝利。」的確，以今年的事實來論，那一物不應節約，即拿這小小一根竹頭而言，所貴亦在十數圓，如果用紙門松祗須五角，相差數十倍，如果有一萬二萬使用者，就可省去一二十萬元。像中國人在新年中最省不了的，就是一對大紅蠟燭，這是完全消耗物，據說最小的亦要五角一對，如果今年每家人家不用，那不知可省去多少呢。</p>
<p>日本人在道極少極簡單的門松上，尚能節的，那在重要的物資上不知怎樣節省呢。在我們的身旁不知有多少飢寒的同胞，我們能顧惜到嗎？希望今年的新年能减少若干無謂的消耗。　（酬充助學金）</p>

<p>— 泓英</p>
<p>「不要看時計！」這是大科學家愛迪生對一個剛從大學畢業的學生所講的話，成功的秘訣一個計劃，在人生的崎嶇道路中，向目的地進行，像一傷在在洋中飄流的小舟，黑暗山洞中摸索着的旅人，要經過阻礙，黑暗，種種的危險；它的成功，不能在一朝一夕問僥倖實現的。</p>
<p>哥侖布的航海，拿破崙的蓋世英雄，他們偉大業續的成功，由於接連的失敗，不斷的奮鬥；他們渡過千萬個黑夜，千萬個難關；他們有堅强的信心，他們的希望裏有一顆成功的種子。永遠在心中滋長着。</p>
<p>但是，偉大的成功者，能够永遠忍耐，不憚失敗，更不以時間來的束自己前程的進展</p>
<p>有人說：人生是有限的，不能與無窮盡的時光相比擬，這也是消極罷了。只要有遠大的眼光，百折不撓的精神，一個計劃，總能克底於成的。</p>
<p>在洋中的飄流，黑暗中的摸索，…一切都嬰忍受，更不要看時計！</p>

<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>你一年一年地過着（不過，當然，不是生病的），你不時要變得睡昏昏，時間的過去，就好像懶惰的牛羣緩緩地橫過田野。吉普斯（Chids）的情形，也是差不多這樣，那時秋季學期在進行着，日子逐漸短了起來，在點名以前，天暗得必須點上煤氣燈。因爲吉普斯正像某一個航海的老船長，仍舊用舊時的信號來測量時間：當然他可以這樣做，因爲他住在威葛特（Wickett）夫人的宅子裏，那就在學校前面，路的那邊。他已經任在這裏十年以上，自從他辭去敎師之職後就往在道裏：他和他的女房東所遵守的是勁洛克菲爾德（Btookfield的時間，不是格林威治（Gteenwich）的時間。「威葛特夫人，」吉普斯會這樣喊出來，聲音是急躁的，尖銳的，還充滿着不少輕快的精神，「你在預備功課鐘以前，給我一杯茶，好不好？」</p>
<p>你一年一年地過着，那末，在火爐旁坐坐，喝上一杯茶，聽學校裏的鐘報着吃飯，點名，預備功課，熄燈，那是好的。吉普斯時常在最後的鐘聲以後去開鐘；然後他將鐵絲防護物放在火爐前面，關去煤氣燈，帶了一本偵探小說上牀去。讀不到一面，他就迅速地，平安地睡着。其情形不像進入了另一個世界，倒像感覺上有了神秘的緊張。因爲他的白　和黑夜都是同樣充滿着夢態的。</p>
<p>他一年一年地過着（不過，當然，不是生病的）：的確，有如牟里阜爾（Merivale醫師所說，對於他眞正沒有什麽有關係的事情。「我親愛的朋友，你比了我更加來得，」牟里阜　會這樣說，啜着杯中的白葡萄酒，他大約每二星期總來看他一次。「你已經過了別人要生重病的年紀：你是少數眞正壽終天年的人中的一個。這是說，當然，假使你要死的話。你是一個誰也不知道的這樣出色的老孩子。」不過，要是吉普斯傷了風，或者東風吼過了那些沼澤，牟里阜爾有時就會將威葛特夫人帶到休息室裏，低低地說：「留心他，你知道。他的胸……這使他的心臟受了傷。他並沒有什麽眞正的病！只是年紀大了，不過這究竟是最嚴重的病根。」　（一）</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Year's Day Wishes <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Today is the thirty-second New Year's Day since the founding of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Thirty-two years. A person at the age of thirty-two should be energetic and promising, a prime of life. He will be like the transition from spring to summer, with flourishing flowers and trees, and all things thriving, full of growing vitality and overflowing with joyful emotions. However, as we look back at our country over the past thirty-two years, what is there that is worth our satisfaction? What is there that is worth our joy? Especially in recent years, we have entered an era of greater hardship and difficulty, and we bear a more arduous and heavy responsibility. At this time, we can only increase our vigilance for the long and arduous journey, and we can only increase our sense of responsibility to the country and society. Where can we find the mood for revelry and celebration? Where can we find the leisure to sing praises and virtues? We believe that this is not only the attitude of this newspaper but must also be the shared sentiment of the compatriots across the country. Therefore, on this New Year's Day of the thirty-second year of the Republic of China, we respectfully write down a few small wishes with a very solemn, tense, and sincere heart.</p>
<p>First, we wish that the nation would face reality squarely, face the reality of the war, and not continue to indulge in a drunken dream of superficial song and dance. The current war, the Greater East Asia War, is a war that determines the fate of the nations of East Asia, and it is also a cruel and long-term war. For the victory of this great war, every East Asian people needs to fight spontaneously. Therefore, each of us must make more arduous preparations to win the final victory. Therefore, all notions of peace, all hedonistic mentalities, and all fantasies of taking credit from Heaven must be quickly put away. From this day forward, let us strive to rejuvenate and welcome the victory of our glorious East Asian national liberation war.</p>
<p>Second, we hope that the friendly relations between China and Japan will truly take a step forward, and we further hope that the mutual relations between the Chinese and Japanese military and civilians will take a step forward towards the goal of genuine understanding and mutual assistance. Originally, China and Japan are East Asian nations of the same script and race. Everyone should not be superficially friendly while harboring suspicions, because cooperation means co-existence, and separation means mutual destruction. This is already a certain truth. Especially since the Greater East Asia War, the friendly relations between China and Japan have laid an unshakable foundation. Everyone should further understand and help each other, everyone should no longer blame the past, no longer nitpick, and no longer cause anything that hinders the feelings of both sides.</p>
<p>Third, we wish that the people's livelihood, especially the food problem and the general price problem, will be reasonably resolved, so that everyone no longer needs to spend energy on trivial daily life matters, so that there is no remaining strength to be loyal to the nation and the country, to assist the friendly nation of Japan in winning the Greater East Asia War. We have repeatedly written reviews on the food problem in Shanghai at the end of last year and opened a special column to publish the opinions and demands of the people from all walks of life. Everyone's meaning is to ask the authorities to increase the amount of household rice. The authorities also paid close attention to this. Therefore, in the most recent issue of household rice, it has been slightly increased. The spirit of the authorities attaching importance to the public opinion of the people is really admirable. However, the increase is still too small. Taking advantage of this New Year's Day, we hope to increase it to the extent that the people can sufficiently maintain their lives and further achieve the greatest goal of stabilizing people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Today we do not have time for flattering and sycophantic empty words, we cannot make unfounded and deceptive predictions, we can only solemnly and sincerely point out the arduousness of the wartime task, point out the heaviness of the responsibility on our shoulders and the vastness of the future. We write down these few small wishes, although they are "lowly without height," they are also the most urgent expectations of everyone at present. We hope that everyone will "not fail to do good because it is small, and not do evil because it is small." If everyone can stand firm in this unprecedented hardship, then the future of the Republic of China must be bright and boundless, the victory of the Greater East Asia War can be assured, and we can celebrate wildly on this day next year.</p>

Therefore, next year (the thirty-second year) will also be the year of implementation. This time I returned to Japan, and I was very pleased to be given various policies by the government. In particular, this time the embassy enshrined the Imperial Portrait (the Emperor's photo), and the worship ceremony will be held on New Year's Day next year (the thirty-second year) (that is, today).

<h3 id="e4">New Year's Address by Prime Minister Tojo: Actively Cooperating Closely with Allied Nations, Overcoming All Difficulties and Laying the Foundation for Victory <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, December 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Greater East Asia War has reached its first year. Under the Emperor's divine power, the soldiers are good at planning and brave in battle, and the people have exerted their total strength to build a great war achievement in world history. Within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the British, American, and Dutch forces were swept away, and a large number of strategic points were occupied in a vast area, ensuring huge and important resources to increase combat power, and establishing the foundation for the certain victory of the Greater East Asia War, and achieving the great ideal of universal harmony since the founding of the country. Today, Japan is still expanding and strengthening this foundation for certain victory, actively cooperating closely with allied countries, helping each other, and continuing to take the offensive against Britain and the United States in order to achieve final victory. At this time, the unity of Germany and Italy, the allied countries in Europe, and Japan has become increasingly close, and they are overcoming all hardships together, and exerting great combat power anytime and anywhere. The Republic of China is also steadily strengthening and sharing responsibilities. Manchuria's foundation is becoming increasingly solid, and it is worthy of being the guardian of the north. Thailand and Japan have been in a defensive alliance for one year. The two countries are working towards a common goal in the spirit of the alliance. At present, the residents in the areas occupied by the Japanese army have deeply understood the true intentions of Japan under orderly military administration, and are actively cooperating to achieve common goals. Therefore, our strength has increased, and the abundant resources in various places can also be actively utilized. As mentioned above, in today's situation, although the British and Americans, who have repeatedly been defeated, still boast of their wealth and strength, and try to counterattack by relying on their productivity, we do not despise them. However, the foundation for Japan's certain victory has been laid. In order to overcome all difficulties, we are determined not to spare any sacrifice, eliminate any obstacles, and use all the human and material resources in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to increase combat power. The 100 million people of Japan are all aware of this. The government also fully exerts the power of national unity in order to ensure the comprehensiveness of the policies. The crown of victory in the Greater East Asia War will surely shine on our heads. At the time of the beginning of the second spring of Showa 18 (the thirty-second year of the Republic of China), our 100 million compatriots remotely wish the soldiers on the front line in the severe cold and heat good health, and are determined to cooperate with each other, increase combat power, renew the belief in certain victory, and sincerely wish the allied countries a glorious and victorious battle in the second year. We also express our deep gratitude to the allied countries for their cooperation, and complete the common goal under close cooperation.</p>

<p>Tokyo, December 31st, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Japan has established an invincible advantage in the vast area of ​​Greater East Asia to welcome this New Year.

The Japanese military's operational area has now expanded to 20,000 kilometers, starting from the Aleutian Islands in the north, crossing the equator and south to the Solomon Islands. This front line includes Arctic and tropical climates, and its length is unprecedented. The total area of ​​the areas occupied by the Japanese military in the south and China is ten times larger than that of Japan's mainland. Currently, the Kwantung Army is guarding the jungles and grasslands of the northern border of Mongolia and Manchuria, and the Western Front Army is on alert on the upper reaches of the Salween River in Yunnan and the Burmese-Indian border. The Japanese military in Malaya, the East Indies, and the Philippines are monitoring the enemy's counterattack attempts.

The Japanese military lost 22,170 people and injured 42,576 people. In the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, there are still fierce battles. The enemy is trying to reinforce its troops trapped on Guadalcanal Island. At the same time, the Japanese people can be proud of the achievements of the past year, but they will never be leisurely because of this. They have made the determination to fight to the final victory to welcome the New Year.</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Focus of the New National Movement This Year <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>——New Year's Day, Thirty-Second Year——</p>
<p>On New Year's Day last year, I promulgated the Outline of the New National Movement, hoping that everyone would practice it themselves, cherish each other, and implement it in an organized and disciplined manner, so as to cultivate a new personality to shoulder the new mission of the new era. This year, we should still adhere to this outline and intensify its implementation, so as to make the spirit of the New National Movement more profound and universal. At the same time, we must also concentrate this spirit on the following three points:</p>
<p>First, cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. The Greater East Asia War is a critical juncture for the safety and survival of the entire East Asian nation. China is a part of East Asia. There is no reason why East Asia is in danger while China is safe alone, or East Asia perishes while China survives alone. In the past year, China has contributed to the Greater East Asia War in the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows. In the year of this year, it will further promote the final victory of the Greater East Asia War in the spirit of sharing security and danger, and sharing life and death.</p>
<p>Second, ensure public security. From the perspective of the situation of the Greater East Asia War, the area under the rule of the National Government is the rear, but also the front line. How can this be explained? Japan is using its naval, land, and air forces to launch an unprecedented struggle against Britain and the United States. China is in the rear and should bear the responsibility of the rear. However, what Britain and China are used to is the policy of East Asians killing East Asians. As soon as the Greater East Asia War began, they incited Chongqing to send troops to Burma, using East Asians as sentries and commando teams to kill each other. Britain and the United States are truly extremely vicious. In addition, they also incited Chongqing to use guerrilla warfare everywhere to contain the Japanese troops stationed in China, wanting to prevent Japan from using all its strength on the front line of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, they constantly harass the peace zone, wanting to make all construction in the peace zone impossible to start. On the one hand, they shout "No peace talks until Japan withdraws its troops," and on the other hand, they use all means to make Japan's withdrawal of troops impossible. From this point of view, we are standing on the front line against Britain and the United States. We must organize a front line of East Asian comrades in the peace zone, so that the running dogs instigated by Britain and the United States have nowhere to harass. Then all the construction in the peace zone can begin, and the so-called protection of public security is also meaningful in this regard.</p>
<p>Third, increase production. Generally speaking, equal distribution, economical consumption, and increased production are equally important, but increased production is still a focus among the three. This year, the government will take full energy to seek to strengthen the production organization, improve the production method, and obtain and utilize production tools. The people will also take full energy to engage in struggle. I hope that the general compatriots will pay attention to this, report the country with thrift, and especially report the country with diligence.</p>
<p>What is said above has almost the same meaning as the protection of public security and the improvement of people's livelihood on New Year's Day last year, but it is actually a step forward, because all our efforts this year should be focused on cooperating with the Greater East Asia War. I hope that the general compatriots will raise the spirit of the New National Movement to shoulder the new mission of the new era.</p>
<h3 id="e14">New Year's Message <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Kenkichi Yoshizawa, Japanese Ambassador to China</p>
<p>At this juncture, the second New Year under the Greater East Asia War, the Anglo-American forces in East Asia have been completely cleared away thanks to the loyalty and bravery of Japanese soldiers. East Asia has been liberated from its shackles, and the vast expanse of East Asia, stretching three thousand miles from north to south, presents an auspicious prospect of ethnic harmony, restoration, and construction.</p>
<p>Our friendly nation, the Republic of China, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, upholding the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows, is vigorously advancing towards the goals of reviving China and safeguarding East Asia. Recently, the Chairman's personal visit to Japan has further strengthened Sino-Japanese relations, which will enable the strengthening and development of the National Government, as well as the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Reflecting on this, we are extremely fortunate.</p>
<p>However, this war is a long-term one. Although we are determined to win and eliminate all obstacles, Britain and the United States still rely on their rich resources and strive to resist stubbornly. Therefore, we must be aware that there are still many thorns on the road to achieving the final glorious victory.</p>
<p>I, the Japanese expatriates in China, far from our homeland, greet the New Year amidst the decisive battle. We should deeply appreciate the Emperor's boundless grace and understand the nation's difficulties. Each of us should diligently perform our duties and strive for Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation to gain the affection of the Chinese people. Furthermore, we hope to contribute to the completion of the war with a renewed determination.</p>
<p>Shunroku Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China</p>
<p>Greeting this second New Year under the Greater East Asia War on the battle line of mainland China, I, together with the officers and soldiers under my command, wish His Majesty the Emperor a long life. On the twelfth day of the last month, His Majesty the Emperor personally visited the Ise Grand Shrine, reported the war results of the past year, and prayed for the completion of the conquest. We, the officers and soldiers of the Expeditionary Army fighting on the mainland battlefield, are deeply grateful and fearful, vowing to repay the Emperor's kindness with our lives. However, it is expected that decisive battles for the survival of Japan will occur on land, sea, and air this year. We fear that even sacrificing ourselves completely would not be enough for this important task. We deeply feel that our New Year's resolution is as firm as iron. In the past year, the China Expeditionary Army has strived to destroy the Chongqing forces on the one hand, and has worked hard to ensure the security of peaceful areas and build a new order on the mainland on the other. However, the hardship of the soldiers lies not only in completing difficult battles, but also in constantly destroying and preventing the Chongqing forces' stubborn and vicious guerrilla warfare and strategic espionage work, so as to maintain security, stabilize the people's hearts, and contribute to Sino-Japanese friendship or various complex construction measures in cooperation. Based on the uniqueness of the mainland battle line, it has its hardships and efforts. However, in order to complete this important task, the officers and soldiers must continue to live a tense wartime life day and night, so as to thoroughly train and make the morale prosperous. Today, we should be confident and prepare for the future. Furthermore, we are sincerely grateful for the united group and enthusiastic and sincere cooperation of all parties in the rear. We would like to express our deepest respect and gratitude here, and we will strive not to betray the expectations of all of you in the future. However, the Chongqing side is doing its best to strengthen the so-called self-reliance resistance system, while making use of the power of Britain and the United States to maintain the battle line, so as to make its international status favorable during the world war situation, and to maintain the last hope of resistance to this. However, its meaningless war is destined to be difficult to achieve. Furthermore, the delusion of wanting to reap the benefits while other countries are at war will never gain national independence and national happiness. This can be clearly understood by referring to the history of ancient and modern times, both East and West. On the contrary, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government under the leadership of Chairman Wang and its people have thoroughly implemented Pan-Asianism and stood with Japan in a spirit of sharing life and death, overcoming all difficulties and sharing the task of completing the Greater East Asia War. Its firm determination and great efforts are truly commendable. I am convinced that the two countries of China and Japan, with the same ideals and common destiny, will cooperate with each other and will surely become the central hub of the revival of Asia in the future.</p>
<p>However, the relationship between China and Japan cannot be expected to return to its original state as soon as possible. That is to say, there are still many difficulties between China and Japan, and we should make greater efforts together in the future. The mission of the Japanese Expeditionary Army on the mainland battle line in the Greater East Asia War is even more important. We must follow the Emperor's will, inherit the legacy of hundreds of thousands of heroic spirits, and respond to the enthusiasm of one hundred million people in the rear, in order to win the great war of ancient times. At the beginning of the year, I would like to express my thoughts to celebrate.</p>
<p>Yoshida Zengo, Commander of the Japanese Fleet in China</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai. Yoshida Zengo, Commander of the Japanese Fleet in China, issued a New Year's message, stating that the scale of the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more magnificent, and the results of the war are becoming more and more prosperous. Today, we are pleased to meet the second New Year of victory, and we are truly excited. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to enable all ethnic groups in East Asia to obtain their own places, help each other and prosper together, establish a true new order, and complete the lofty ideals of the Japanese Empire. Japan is determined to resolutely remove any obstacles encountered, which can be omitted without further explanation. Once the Japanese army rises up, the enemy forces entrenched in the Greater East Asia will be expelled, and brilliant war results will be achieved in the vast sea, land, and air, shocking the world. However, the Chongqing side still overestimates the strength of Britain and the United States, and is still indulging in the stubborn dream of resisting Japan, which only makes the majority of the people increase their burden and continue to resist the war without any chance of winning and without any purpose. The Japanese fleet in China maintains close coordination with the army units in China, and has always worked hard to reduce the Chongqing side, so as to implement the purpose of the holy war.</p>
<p>At present, Japan has achieved unprecedented war results in world history, obtained abundant resources in Southeast Asia, and established an invincible system to deal with any counterattack and any long-term war. This is due to the collection of the total strength of loyal and brave soldiers and the people in the rear. Thinking of this, the people should not be arrogant when winning, and continue to overcome all difficulties, strengthen their determination, and always complete the purpose of the holy war. Today, we are pleased to meet the second New Year under the Greater East Asia War, and we wish His Majesty the Emperor a long life. At the same time, we hope to live up to the expectations of the Emperor with a new determination.</p>
<p>Aiyi Tajiri, Japanese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to China</p>
<p>At this time, when the Greater East Asia War is ushered in again, looking back at the past year, the Japanese army swept away the British and American forces and established unprecedented war results in world war history. Following the occupation of Hong Kong and Manila, Singapore also fell, and the southern regions were completely controlled. The strongholds of British and American aggression in East Asia over the years were destroyed in an instant. The entire East Asia has returned to its original state, and everyone is singing for the celebration of rebirth. This is nothing more than the result of the heroic fighting of the imperial army under the imperial authority. Every imperial soldier shed the last drop of blood to destroy Britain and the United States, and sacrificed himself to complete the purpose of the war. We can only express our heartfelt gratitude for this supreme and pure spirit. The past year was spent in the sound of the victory song of the initial battle, that is, sweeping across the entire East Asia with a momentum like a broken bamboo, making the world succumb. The war is a long-term war. This has been advocated by the general public since the character of the Sino-Japanese Incident was clarified. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this statement was even more felt to be true, prompting us to realize and implement various measures to deal with this long-term war. War and construction go hand in hand, which is the greatest feature of modern warfare. The resources of the southern regions have been utilized by us as soon as the smoke clears, and have become our combat power. With the smooth progress of construction, we firmly believe that there is nothing to worry about in a long-term war. However, the enemy has recently relied on abundant resources and strong productivity to try to save the situation. From this point of view, the war has become a stage of attrition in which everyone and everything, both the enemy and us, are using the total national power to go all out. The era of building for war has passed. Building must be used for combat. The establishment of a thorough decisive battle system in Japan is becoming more and more important along with it. What the country seeks from us today is, first of all, to cultivate combat power, and how to adapt to the needs of the country and deploy combat power. This and construction are the responsibilities that our shoulders should bear. Fortunately, the National Government of the Republic of China has been determined to consolidate and complete the Greater East Asia War in the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows, adapt to changes in the situation, and further stand in the position of sharing life and death, sharing the fate of East Asia, and working hard to complete the great cause of liberating East Asia. The chairman's previous decision to visit Japan and have open and honest talks with our court and the wild, the Sino-Japanese new cooperation system has undergone a unified turning point here, and it is not easy to promote the construction business. We must make every effort to overcome many adverse conditions with limited manpower and materials. However, its success or failure can directly determine the outcome of the war. Whenever we think of this, we cannot allow the slightest delay or hesitation. Whether it is the front line or the rear, it is the place of combat. The delay and slackness of the rear can affect the front line. At the time of the beginning of a new year and the renewal of the universe, we should consolidate our determination to complete the great cause, and silently express our sincere condolences to the loyal and brave heroic spirits who sacrificed their lives for the country. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the officers and soldiers on the front line for their hard work and high achievements, and we offer incense and wish them a long life, and we look forward to the arrival of the day of final victory.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Review and Prospect of Clearing the Countryside in Shanghai <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Gongbo</p>
<p>Time flies, and the thirty-second year of the Republic of China has come to the world again. With the renewal of the year, both the government and the people should have a new plan for the future, and should make a general review of the past.</p>
<p>In order to establish local security, effectively improve people's livelihood, gradually expand local peace, and realize comprehensive Sino-Japanese peace as soon as possible, the National Government established the Countryside Clearing Committee in July of the previous year, and it has been a year and a half today. The work of clearing the countryside has been launched in a wide area and has achieved satisfactory results.</p>
<p>First, the characteristics of clearing the countryside in Shanghai. There are no large-scale roaming bandits in the urban area of Shanghai. There are occasional sporadic bandits, either blindly following or being coerced, disrupting the local area, which is not their original intention. Once the clearing of the countryside is launched, it is not difficult to sweep away the weak bandits in a short period of time. The fundamental key is to clarify the source of chaos in the people's thinking. Therefore, ideological clearing of the countryside is the first characteristic of clearing the countryside in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Second, the reason why Shanghai has become a den of evil and made the society dark and the gangsters active is mainly due to the fact that this clearing of the countryside in Shanghai has paid more attention to the clearing of gangsters. This is the second characteristic of clearing the countryside in Shanghai. Third, Shanghai is the most important city in China, and Shanghai has become an important base in the rear of Greater East Asia. Establishing security in the rear to promote the victory of the front line is the belief that those who are dedicated to Sino-Japanese peace must have. How to make Shanghai, which has been immersed in British and American forces for a hundred years, sweep away the British and American colors, restore the original appearance of the East, and rebuild a new Shanghai, this is the third characteristic of clearing the countryside in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fourth, the indicators of future work. Looking back at the Shanghai Qingxiang in the past four months, we are optimistic about the future. Now we must follow this effort to make what has been done better, and what has not been done must be done in the short term. Here are the main points as the indicators for Shanghai Qingxiang in the future. In the future, our work will still be focused on the characteristics of Shanghai Qingxiang.</p>
<p>1. Strengthen local administrative organs, integrate government, politics, education, health, etc., and improve administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>2. Consolidate local security, cultivate people's spirit of loving their hometown, strengthen people's self-defense forces, improve police administration, and strengthen the organization of police defense groups.</p>
<p>3. Thoroughly rectify land tax revenue, establish tax revenue budget, and increase funding for local construction projects.</p>
<p>4. Expand schools, popularize education, pay attention to qualitative improvement, and increase quantity.</p>
<p>5. Actively revive local construction, hold social welfare undertakings, rectify transportation, and restore water conservancy.</p>
<p>6. Strengthen the lower-level organizations of the party, expand the number of party members, absorb outstanding elements into the party, and train lower-level party members.</p>
<p>7. Implement the New Life Movement and promote the People's Movement, implement new national training, and organize various industry associations and trade unions.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Recent Situation in Xinjiang <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>Translated from Macau</p>
<p>The author recently traveled to Dihua and stayed in Dihua for three weeks. During his stay in Dihua, he met and talked with Sheng Shicai many times. The underground of Xinjiang Province is rich in deposits, which have never been thoroughly surveyed by most experts on the ground. Therefore, the exact quantity and quality of the deposits are still unknown. According to the person in charge of Xinjiang Province, the deposits in Xinjiang Province are far beyond the estimation of the general public. However, the land is vast and the population is sparse. To this day, the total population of Xinjiang is only 4.5 million. Therefore, the immigration issue needs to be resolved urgently. Sheng Shicai told people that Xinjiang has all kinds of grains and is not short of vegetables and fruits. The people in the hinterland can be moved here as soon as possible. However, in fact, due to the lack of development in transportation and water conservancy, the immigration issue is always difficult to resolve satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Soong Mei-ling, Zhu Shaoliang, Weng Wenhao, Liang Hancao and others have recently visited Xinjiang one after another. Zhu Shaoliang traveled to and from Xinjiang Province as many as four times within half a year. Wu Zexiang assists the local government in handling foreign affairs. The city of Dihua is being rebuilt, and the civil engineering is as prosperous as Lanzhou in recent years. Other situations are gradually changing, but it takes time. Daily necessities are quite scarce due to the difficulty in sourcing them.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that Xinjiang Province is an important town in the Northwest and an international transportation hub, the Ministry of Finance of the Chongqing government has formulated four items of the "Circulating Currency Measures" for Xinjiang Province. It has telegraphed the Xinjiang Provincial Government for consent and announced it by the Xinjiang Provincial Government on November 1: (1) The "Central Bank" will soon set up a branch in Xinjiang to issue "Customs Gold Bonds", which will circulate at the same time as the Xinjiang Provincial currency. It is tentatively stipulated that 25 cents of "Customs Gold Bonds" will be converted into 1 yuan of the Xinjiang Provincial currency. All remittances between the provinces in the hinterland and Xinjiang Province, as well as public and private receipts and payments within Xinjiang Province, and all trade, shall be handled in accordance with the above-mentioned laws when paying and receiving "Customs Gold Bonds". (2) If Xinjiang Province needs foreign exchange, it can apply to the "Central Bank" for the supply of "Customs Gold Bonds". (3) The agencies under the "Ministry of Finance" will supply Xinjiang Province with daily necessities such as tea and sugar. (4) During the transition period, the provincial currency will continue to circulate as usual, and it may be handled in accordance with the unified issuance method when necessary. The "Ministry of Finance" will send a supervisor to the provincial bank to supervise.</p>
<p>Xinjiang Province's construction undertakings have made rapid progress. In addition to the Dushanzi oil mine, which is being planned for large-scale exploitation and reorganization, many oil fields have been discovered in two places in southern Xinjiang. It is said that the above-mentioned oil mines are in the same line as the Caucasian oil fields. In order to solve the difficulty of water conservancy as much as possible, the Xinjiang Provincial Construction Department completed the Yulong Canal, which is 96 kilometers long in Yining, last year, which can irrigate more than 10,000 hectares of farmland in Yining, Suiding, and Huiyuan counties. Now it is working hard to dig the Hongxi Pool channel in the Tianhan Sea of Tianshan. The pool is 10 kilometers away from Dihua City and is located on the top of Tianshan. It is boundless and looks like a sea of clouds. The author once climbed the mountain to visit, and it was like being in the Yaochi described in old novels. It is truly a wonder of nature. The channel is 41 kilometers long and can irrigate 4,000 hectares of land. It will be officially released in April next year. In the future, Dihua food can be supplied without the need for other counties. In addition, the Hanhai on the Bokeda Mountain in Fukang County is also under construction. The water from the canal can irrigate 3,000 hectares of land. The Jin Yong Canal in Maigaiti, Kashgar District, is also being planned for construction. In addition, Dihua is also carrying out the construction of the Jin Yong Mechanized Farm as a demonstration of agricultural science.</p>
<p>In terms of education, in the 27th year, there were a total of 1,769 public schools and schools of various cultural associations, with 139,926 students. In the current year, the number of schools has increased to 2,439, with 268,680 students. Including the number of people who have been educated in public schools and social education institutions, among the 4.5 million people in Xinjiang, more than 500,000 people are being educated, and more than 800,000 people can be added who have been educated. At present, all schools are strengthening the Mandarin course. More and more ethnic minorities are speaking Chinese, and each school stipulates that Han and Uygur students live together. The various teaching materials taught in the inland have been widely adopted in Xinjiang.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Expansion of the Goods Control Office - Changed to an Independent Institution - No Longer Subordinate to the General Office <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Goods Control Office of the Public Works Department has been actively working under the leadership of Director Inagaki to adjust prices and distribute materials, sparing no effort. In terms of management, the office was originally under the jurisdiction of the General Office. Recently, the work of the office has suddenly increased and the scope has expanded day by day. The board of directors of the Public Works Department decided to change it to an independent institution and no longer subordinate to the General Office, which will be implemented from January 1 this year.</p>
<p>Set Appropriate and Reasonable Prices</p>
<p>Director Inagaki of the Goods Control Office once made a speech on the relationship between the current situation and price control, saying that the situation in Shanghai has been very different from the past year. In the past, the determination of the price index was entirely based on free trade, but now it must be based on controlled economy. In other words, the standard of prices in the past was determined by the overall supply and demand of the world, but now it is only controlled by the supply and demand of materials in East Asia. Generally speaking, cheap prices are for abundant materials and dear prices are for short materials, not to determine the program of price high or low, but to set appropriate and reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Officials and Businessmen Agreed on Low-Price Policy</p>
<p>In order to stabilize people's livelihood, the authorities will implement a low-price policy. On the part of businessmen, they should try to lower prices as much as possible. For the general public, they must try their best to restrain consumption. As for the implementation of the low-price policy, in addition to the use of laws, we should promote the automatic awareness of businessmen and the sincere cooperation of the people. In this regard, the guild section that has been established is expected to be of great help. The establishment of this section is to promote the relationship between the authorities and various trade associations. If officials and businessmen can communicate with each other, things can be promoted smoothly and the effect will be doubled.</p>

<p>Speeches by Representatives</p>
<p>Tekeshibayan, Representative of the Mongolian United Autonomous Government Resident in Japan</p>
<p>As a wing of the construction of Greater East Asia, Mengjiang bears a very important mission because it is the base for advancing forward. This is an unmistakable fact based on the repeated statements of the Japanese government. Understanding the basic concept of Greater East Asia construction in Japan, which is taking huge strides in construction under the Greater East Asia War, the officials and people of Mengjiang are enduring hardship and poverty together with Japan, and are highly developing the important mission of being a special anti-communist vanguard region on the mainland. In view of this situation, people often misunderstand it as "Blockism". However, because it is a region where the imperial army is stationed, and it is appointed as the "defense fortress" of the various regions of the mainland, this point must be understood by all parties.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the mission of Mengjiang's economic construction, various tasks must be comprehensively promoted. At the same time, as a special economic region, it is necessary to develop and utilize its important resources in order to provide comprehensive cooperation to Japan and make a great contribution to each region of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>To put it briefly, the most important point is the self-sufficiency policy and the progress and strengthening of the planned economy. It goes without saying that it is easier to promote economic construction in a virgin economic land like Mengjiang.</p>
<p>In terms of national defense economy, Mengjiang also has its own special economic character and special location conditions. Mengjiang, which is distinguished by the Great Wall Line, crosses the Badaling and includes the two railways of the Jingbao Line and the Tongpu Line. It is very important that the economy must be controlled by these two railway lines. Taking these transportation networks into consideration makes us feel that it is very necessary to establish a self-sufficient system.</p>
<p>At present, Mengjiang's richest resources, such as iron, coal, black lead, asbestos and other underground resources, wool, fur and other light industrial raw materials, and miscellaneous grains, etc., are supplied at the lowest price at the request of Japan in order to seek comprehensive cooperation. Even to North China and Manchuria, iron and coal are supplied at the same lowest price. On the other hand, the imports from the above-mentioned places have to be imported at high prices because Japan and North China have so-called adjustment fees.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mengjiang's burden and sacrifice are very great. However, with the economic construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere as the top priority, we still have to grit our teeth and endure it. The planned economy is still developing rapidly. For example, the improvement and increased production of animal hair and fiber raw materials, irrigation and water conservancy, farmland development, variety improvement, agricultural guidance, etc., the improvement and increased production of long animal products, and the establishment of a self-sufficient system due to the development of light industry. In addition, there are significant developments in communications, electricity, transportation, etc. However, as mentioned earlier, due to the poverty of economic land and capital, the weakness of foreign investment, and many other obstacles in development and operation, the economic construction plan has not been able to be completed as expected. Regarding these, we expect cooperation and support from Japan.</p>

Each household will temporarily be able to purchase one catty of oil, priced at seven yuan and one dime including tax, or four taels.</p>
<p>The Lianbaozhang and the subordinate Baohu Jiazhang of the Baojia district are requested to assist, based on the Baojia district household registers, and issue "Oil Purchase Certificates" to each household. The certificate shall be stamped by the Lianbao Office of the jurisdiction and used to purchase oil from designated food oil retail stores, and the month and date shall be indicated, limited to daily use. It is heard that the trial implementation has been quite effective, able to prevent the activities of oil speculators and resale for profit, as well as avoid the suffering of queuing and crowding.</p>

<p>Recently, the national cultural circles have launched a movement for cultural figures to voluntarily unite and jointly build a pure cultural undertaking. All quarters responded enthusiastically. Recently, many people in the cultural circles of this city began to discuss and prepare to form a national universal "Chinese Cultural Association." A symposium was held on the 20th, attended by more than 50 people, who elected Zhou Yueran, Huang Jingwan, Tao Kangde, Zhou Lianan, Qian Gong, Yang Guangzheng, Yu Qie, Liu Yusheng, Yang Hua, Liang Shili, and He Yi to be responsible for preparations. Famous writers from Nanjing, Beijing, Suzhou, Wuhan, Hong Kong, Guangdong, and other places, such as Zhou Zuoren, Shen Qiwu Yun Bingqi, Zhang Wojun, Li Jingci, Ding —, Gong Chiping, and Long Muxun, have expressed enthusiastic support. The association is currently expanding its contacts. Mayor Chen of this city advocates cultural undertakings and has always been enthusiastic. The day before yesterday morning, he met with representatives of the association at the Municipal Government Office on Yuyuan Road and expressed his approval of the Shanghai cultural figures' voluntary organization of a group to devote themselves to cultural undertakings, and expressed his willingness to do his best to help solve all difficulties, so as to ensure that the cultural association is completed as soon as possible and jointly promote cultural undertakings, adding a unique touch to the current dull cultural circles. He then solicited the opinions of the representatives and talked until about 11:00 AM before dispersing. In the afternoon, Director Feng of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office</p>
<p>met with them and gave a speech, saying that the Shanghai cultural circles have gradually shown a thriving trend in recent months, which is gratifying. We should promote it at this time and guide it into the right track for rational development. The cultural elites once gathered on the 20th, and it is heard that they are actively preparing to establish the Chinese Cultural Association, and the leaders and initiators are all well-known figures in the cultural circles. I am in a position related to the cultural circles and believe that this is exactly what we have been hoping for day and night. I am deeply excited, especially since the organization of the cultural circles this time is purely voluntary, which shows that the government's efforts over the years have awakened the people, and the cultural circles themselves have also expressed their awareness of taking responsibility.</p>

<p>According to an investigation report by the Third Group of the Political Work Corps of the Shanghai-Qing Branch, the tax collectors in Nanhui District collect additional service fees (ranging from 25 cents to 50 cents per mu) and security expenses in addition to the fixed regular surcharges. The penalty for late payment exceeds 20%. The so-called service fees, security expenses, and penalties for late payment have no explicit provisions and are clearly surcharges. Please investigate and prohibit such practices. Since it is important to stabilize people's livelihood and strictly prohibit surcharges and extra donations and taxes, a letter has been sent to the First Department to investigate the surcharge situation and issue a prohibition. It is learned that the branch has sent a special commissioner to Nanhui District to investigate and deal with the matter, and has issued a bulletin to strictly prohibit such practices.</p>

<h3 id="e56">"Paper Pine and Bamboo" - An Expression of the Japanese Spirit of Thrift <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Wozhao</p>
<p>Whenever you see a gate decorated with pine and bamboo during the New Year, you know that a Japanese family lives there. This is because the so-called *kadomatsu* (gate pine), made of pine, bamboo, and plum, is the most important New Year decoration in Japan. Pine symbolizes permanence, bamboo represents uprightness, and together with plum blossoms, they release a clear and fragrant aroma.</p>
<p>In Japan proper, the Japanese often begin preparations for the *kadomatsu* ten days or so before the New Year, and they are particularly meticulous in selecting the bamboo. This is usually the work of the boys in the family, and they may spend several days searching for the most perfect and straight green bamboo. Once selected, the bamboo is cut diagonally at the top, bundled with pine and plum, and placed in a wooden pot in the most prominent place at the entrance. However, this year, green bamboo is difficult to buy in Shanghai, and it is also quite expensive. Therefore, on the 25th, the "Certain Victory Decisive Battle Type Paper Kadomatsu" was promoted by the Total Strength Patriotic Association. This type of paper *kadomatsu* uses a sheet of paper one foot three inches long and eight inches wide, painted in three colors to resemble a *kadomatsu*, and pasted on the front gate to replace the real *kadomatsu*. Group Leader Fukuda said: "The *kadomatsu* is a pure and beautiful Japanese custom, but during this time of the Greater East Asia War, the people should embrace the belief of self-reliance and self-discipline, cherish resources, and at the same time promote the simple spirit of Japan, in order to achieve final victory." Indeed, judging from the facts of this year, everything should be conserved. Even this small bamboo shoot costs more than ten yuan. If a paper *kadomatsu* costs only fifty cents, the difference is dozens of times. If one or two million people use it, it can save one or two hundred thousand yuan. The one thing the Chinese cannot save on during the New Year is a pair of large red candles. These are completely consumable. It is said that even the smallest pair costs fifty cents. If every household does not use them this year, I don't know how much could be saved.</p>
<p>If the Japanese can economize even on the extremely simple *kadomatsu*, one wonders how they conserve on essential resources. Around us, there are countless hungry and cold compatriots. Can we take care of them? We hope that this year's New Year will reduce some unnecessary consumption. (Proceeds will be donated to help students.)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Don't Look at the Clock <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Ying</p>
<p>"Don't look at the clock!" This is what the great scientist Edison told a student who had just graduated from university. The secret to success in a plan is to progress towards the destination on the rugged road of life, like a small boat drifting in the ocean, or a traveler groping in a dark cave, having to overcome obstacles, darkness, and all kinds of dangers. Its success cannot be achieved by chance overnight.</p>
<p>Columbus's voyage and Napoleon's world-shaking heroism, the success of their great achievements, came from continuous failures and constant struggle. They crossed thousands of dark nights and thousands of difficult obstacles. They had strong faith, and their hope contained a seed of success, which always grew in their hearts.</p>
<p>However, great achievers can always endure, not fearing failure, and not allowing time to restrict the progress of their future.</p>
<p>Some say: life is finite and cannot be compared to endless time, but this is just pessimism. As long as you have a grand vision and an indomitable spirit, a plan can always be brought to fruition.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Origin of Establishing a Social Service Center - Benefiting the Poor, Sick, and Needy - Purely for Reader Service <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Meaning of Establishment</p>
<p>This newspaper, in view of the fact that in Shanghai today, there are many elderly, weak, disabled, extremely poor, and hidden poor who are suffering from hunger and cold and have no means of livelihood; and that there are many needy children suffering from the pain of being out of school, all of whom are in urgent need of relief and assistance; therefore, in the spirit of human mutual aid and serving society, it has established a social service center, hoping to appeal to people from all walks of life to contribute financially with sincere compassion, so that by gathering small contributions, great things can be accomplished. Firstly, a committee will be organized by impartial people of the community, who will be responsible for the custody and distribution of funds, to show impartiality and that not a single drop will be wasted. Even if it is a drop in the bucket and cannot solve everything, doing our part is still fulfilling our responsibility and achieving results. On the one hand, we will establish contact with various charities, schools, and hospitals to work together. In addition, we will also solve life problems related to health, law, and career for general readers, and invite experts to provide detailed guidance. All of this work must be actively promoted, and we have specially invited Mr. Huang Jingwan, who is dedicated to serving society, to preside over it. The preparations have already received enthusiastic responses from all walks of life, showing that there are many people who are enthusiastic about public welfare, further proving that the establishment of this center is an action that adapts to the environment. We will further provide systematic reports, and a special corner will be opened in this newspaper's "Free Talk" section to publish news about social services. We sincerely hope that readers who want to help and those who need help will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Scope of Service</p>
<p>(1) Relief of the poor and sick</p>
<p>(2) Subsidies for those out of school</p>
<p>(3) Health guidance</p>
<p>(4) Legal guidance</p>
<p>(5) Reading guidance</p>
<p>(6) Career guidance</p>
<p>(7) Other public welfare services</p>
<p>Service Methods</p>
<p>(1) Those who apply for economic assistance must first obtain a registration form from this center, fill it out in detail according to the format, and after investigation and verification, it will be published in this column.</p>
<p>(2) Those who apply for various types of guidance should use the mail to explain in detail and send it directly to this center, which will forward it to experts for answers, and then reply by letter or publish it in this column if necessary. If necessary, we will ask the applicant to meet in person.</p>
<h3 id="e59">All Staff of This Newspaper Donate Banquet Funds to Help the Poor <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Since this newspaper launched the poverty relief campaign, it has repeatedly received sympathy and support from all walks of life. Now, all the staff of this newspaper will donate the funds for their gathering dinner, totaling 3,000 yuan in Central Reserve Notes, to the poverty relief fund. The original letter stated briefly: "At the beginning of the year, the colleagues originally planned to gather for a banquet during the New Year's holiday to promote fellowship. However, thinking that this newspaper is currently advocating economy and poverty relief, and extending this to others, we have converted the cost of the banquet into 3,000 yuan in national currency and donated it to the poverty relief fund. We know that this small amount is not enough to solve the problem, but we hope that readers and enthusiastic people will generously implement it and donate voluntarily. By accumulating small contributions, it is not difficult to achieve results. In addition to sending our apologies, we would like to express our gratitude to all the colleagues on behalf of the poor and sick compatriots. We also hope that all walks of life will donate voluntarily and jointly accomplish this good deed."</p>
<h3 id="e60">Reader's Suggestion: Economize on Spring Banquets to Help the Poor <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Reader Ying Yongyu wrote to this newspaper saying: "At this time of year, according to our country's custom, relatives and friends need to send New Year's gifts to each other. Currently, everything is expensive, and even small gifts cost hundreds of gold. Moreover, most gifts are consumables, and the recipients do not actually use them. In order to respond to the economy and poverty relief campaign, donating the cost of gifts to your newspaper's poverty relief fund is a win-win situation. I hope you will promote this widely and vigorously advocate it. If all the fellow citizens in the city save on sending New Year's gifts, counting 2,000 people, each person donating 60 yuan, it would exceed 100,000 yuan, benefiting many poor and sick people."</p>

<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Year after year you went on (not ill, of course), you were apt to get sleepy at times, the passage of time was like lazy cattle slowly crossing a field. Chips's case was much the same; the autumn term was in progress, the days were growing shorter, and it was dark enough to light the gas lamps before roll call. For Chips was like some old sea captain, still measuring time by the old signals: of course he could do this, because he lived in Mrs. Wickett's house, which was just across the road from the school. He had lived there for more than ten years, ever since he had resigned from his teaching position: he and his landlady kept to Brookfield time, not Greenwich time. "Mrs. Wickett," Chips would call out, his voice sharp and brisk, but with no lack of cheerful spirit, "a cup of tea before prep bell, would you be so kind?"</p>
<p>Year after year you went on, so it was good to sit by the fire, have a cup of tea, and listen to the school bells calling to meals, roll call, prep, and lights out. Chips often went to turn off the bells after the last bell; then he would put the wire guard in front of the fire, turn off the gas lamp, and go to bed with a detective novel. He would fall asleep quickly and peacefully before he finished one page. It was not like entering another world, but rather like feeling a mysterious tension. For his days and nights were equally filled with dreaminess.</p>
<p>Year after year he went on (not ill, of course): indeed, as Dr. Merivale said, nothing really mattered to him. "My dear fellow, you have got more out of life than I have," Merivale would say, sipping a glass of white wine, he came to see him about once every two weeks. "You are past the age when people get seriously ill: you are one of the few people who really die of old age. That is to say, of course, if you are going to die at all. You are such a wonderfully good old boy that nobody knows what to do with you." But if Chips caught a cold, or the east wind howled across those marshes, Merivale would sometimes take Mrs. Wickett into the parlor and say in a low voice, "Keep an eye on him, you know. His chest… It has damaged his heart. He has no real illness! Just old age, but that is, after all, the most serious root cause." (1)</p>
