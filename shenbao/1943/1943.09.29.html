<p>社評</p>
<h3>重慶政權的動向（下）　—甲乙兩君的一問一答</h3>
<p>乙：這樣說來，重慶政權在對共問題與民意趨向問題中，已經遭遇到了極困難的地步。現在進而請言經濟情勢</p>
<p>甲：當然，經濟上的危機，是重慶致命的危機之一。一方面要拖戰，一方面又不得不向英美求乞，試想這是什麽局面？羅果夫論及重慶這一方面的危機，他說：「重慶建立自己的戰時經濟的任務也沒有完成，在自己的領土上擁有一切軍需原料，然而未曾進行大規模的建設，因為工業界及財政界寗願從事於發「國靴財」，不願把資本投入於軍火工業中，肆無忌憚的發「國難財」者提出了這樣一個理論：人民厭戰了！因此首先必須滿足人民對於物品的需要等等。這種形勢，造成了軍隊戰鬥力的削弱以及更加依賴於英美軍火的供給。而自日本與英美開戰以來，這方面便遭到嚴重的困難。」</p>
<p>乙：羅果夫這種論調，自然是以一個共產主義者的身份來說的，但是……</p>
<p>甲：不錯，我們不必論羅果夫的立塲，而是注意其所列舉的事實。他所說的，至少已可窺見重慶今日經濟危機的一斑了。其實，重慶方面自己也是承認的。據傳重慶此次「國民參政會三屆二次大會」中曾經發生了疵議經濟政策的事件。主要的是　工業建設配合未能確當，而有畸形發展現象，如鋼鐵生產就有停滯狀况，即為工業建設前途一大危機。　資金缺乏問題　貸款手續繁雜問題。　虛贏實稅問題。　工廠囤積原料問題。　社會游資逃避工業投資問題。　「國」營與民營間糾紛問題。</p>
<p>乙：誠然，有些由內地出來的經濟界人士，有種種苦痛的訴述。然而重慶近來不是宣傳物價物資政策之成功為整個戰時經濟成功的前提嗎？</p>
<p>甲：是的，蔣介石有過「加强物資物價管制之案」，宣傳其內容如何完備，然而據傳這次「國民參政會」中，却曾提出種種指摘，自方案實施以來，不僅成效未見，而且發生了與預期效果相反的現象，其原因大致是：　各地方政府未能對各地物資之供需詳為調査，統劉調劑；　實施「限政」前各種準備條件不足，當局的資材不充分，商人的價格不確實，結果到處發生紛擾。　管制僅及於「點」的控制，忽於「面」的管制，致「點」所建立的根據無法維持。更主要的是渝方財政政策未　經濟政策相配合，如任意提高稅率及公營事業漲價等。</p>
<p>乙：聽說重慶近來實行所謂「專賣制度」，結果如何</p>
<p>甲：據傳這種專賣制度實行以來，因為收買價格與出售價格相差懸殊，引起各方面的物議。其實，引起人民不良印象的事太多了，姑且再舉幾件最顯著的：</p>
<p>花紗價格，極形紊亂，但因管制輕重有失公允，人心不　，各地花商多不就範。</p>
<p>募公債，原為緊縮通貨，增加財源，但自去年起，實行强迫攤派，且未依公平普遍原則，富戶多得巧避，只有中下階層遭殃。</p>
<p>「貿易委員會」成立之目的，原為調整出口貿易，鼓勵後方生產，但實際上海外交通路錢縮短，出口停滯，而機關費用浩繁，浪擲「國帑」，且收購價格極不合理，反致阻抑人民生產熱情，結果生產减少。</p>
<p>乙：但是，所謂「開發西北，建設西北」，不是在重慶曾經盛唱過嗎？</p>
<p>甲：為了整個經濟沒有出路，因而提出了所謂西北政策。然而西北情形特殊，第一是國際問題，牽涉到蘇聯與美英的對立；第二政治問題，牽涉到渝共關係；第三是民族與宗敎問題，西北是回，維，蒙各族占優勢的地區，而且回敎徒又占絕對優勢，重慶的經營首先就要解決上述問題。然而，實際上問題正多，第一是邊疆經營的人才問題，第二是交通問題，第三是機械問題，第四是資金問題。這種問題無法完善解決，所以至今除了調查考察與計劃方案之外，未有若何成效，即以農墾而言，水利與交通之建設，也非鉅額資金與大量人才不可，何况，收獲最早也得期之於五年十年之後，眞是「緩不濟急」啊。</p>
<p>乙：重慶在軍事·政治·經濟與民心趨向旣均無辦法，那麼不正是促成全面和平的機運嗎？</p>
<p>甲：在理論上，可以這樣的推論，但是正如申報星期評論「論全面和平」一文所指出的，由於重慶的國際關係，由於以英美為後台的一派掌握政權，由於具有軍隊支配力的黃埔系的支持，更由於知日派勢力的尙未抬頭，所以，重慶政權還能挾「抗戰」政策以維持其地位，只有這種情勢發生變化以後，或是用一切方法使這種情勢發生變化，全面和平才可收水到渠成之效。總之：重慶統治下人民的離心力正在發展，只待國際情勢有了變化，只待和平區內政治上軌道，人民生活有了充分的保障，日木對華新政策澈底實現了，那時，全面和平就不難實現，統一建設的大業才得大步邁進。</p>

<h3>日駐華派遣軍　發表綜合戰果</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍，二十八日發表八月份日駐華派遣軍綜合戰果知次：　日陸上部隊戰况與敵交戰次數一五五七次，敵軍交戰兵力一七三三六三人，敵軍陣亡七五一〇人，被俘及投降日軍者六七二九人。日軍並奪獲各種大砲九門，砲彈七二枚，重輕機槍五八挺，槍彈七九六一枚，步槍三三四四枝，槍彈一八八四枚，擲彈筒及手槍二九枚，槍彈五四枚，手溜彈七一五二枚，刺刀及刀槍類六五〇柄，其他通信材料火藥馬匹被服等甚多。　日航空部隊戰果，擊落敵機三五　，內未證實者一架。　日方損失計陣亡三二十人，自炸及未返防飛機三架。又八月中國外事主要作戰如次：　自七月十日以來，繼續殲滅南太行山地區殘存渝軍，　進所率第二十七軍。俘虜渝預備第八師師長陳孝强中將，澈底擊潰該軍，挫折其重建華北游擊基點之企圖。　七月二十七日以來，開始進攻營蘇戰區于學忠軍所部，於微山湖附近，將其包圍，重創其主力第一百十一師及第一百十四師，將其擊潰。　晉察冀地區共產軍聶榮軍，近欲於蒙疆華北地區開始蠢動，經日軍展開剿共戰後，已覆滅其北上據點。此外日軍對於華北共產軍之蠢動，並能先發制人，予以重創，收獲莫大戰果。又八月戰果之特性如次：日軍與敵交戰次數　總計一五五七次，其中與共產軍交戰達八二六次，約佔百分之五三弱。敵軍交戰兵力一七三三六三人，其中共產軍為七四一八八人，約佔百分之四二弱。敵軍陣亡七五一〇人，其中共產軍為二八八九人，約佔百分之三八·四。被俘及投降日軍之六七二九人中，共產軍為一五四五人，約佔百分之二四·四。由是觀之，日軍之剿共戰已有顯著强化，尤其華北地區。又敵軍出動之交戰兵力一七三三六三人中，被日軍擊亡俘虜及投降日軍者為一四二三九人，約佔百分之六一。尤其俘虜及投降人數之增多，足證敵軍戰意消沉，戰力削弱。又日航空部隊近除進攻　　空軍基地建甌·衡陽·桂林等地，展開活潑之作戰外，並迎擊來襲之敵機，收獲極大戰果。二十三日並奇襲重慶基地，足使敵方為之寒心。此外華北方面並密切協力南太行山作戰使陸上部隊易於進攻。</p>
<h3>日定十月下旬　開臨時議會　內閣通過設軍需省</h3>

<h3>德為求民族生存　決奮鬥到底　里賓特羅甫廣播演說</h3>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　德外長里賓特羅甫昨日下午七時半廣播演說如次：三國同盟之目的，在使過去由於歷史關係昭於惡化地位之各民族恢復其生存權利，並滿足此等民族絕對不可缺之一切要求。各貧困民族於過去數年中。雖曾再三努力，俾與富足之國家謀求和平解決，然此等交涉巳全歸失敗。對此種努力始終表示反對者即英美蘇三國。此等國家所企圖者，不外為支配使歐洲各民族奴隸鏵欲征服世界者即英美蘇三國，決非軸心各國，尤其共產主義國家侵略之企圖最為明顯。今共產主義之理念與武力，正與德軍棉築之堅固防禦陣相對峙，德軍若不澈底　除共產主義之危險，則絕不放棄武器。英美兩國現與蘇聯協力攻擊歐洲，然若蘇　獲得勝利。對民主主義國家則為一大破局。英美兩國國民他日必可省悟自此等可怖之政局中挽救歐洲救濟民主主義國家者，即德國國民及其盟邦。民主主義國家將對歐洲採何等態度，徵諸彼等對義國國民之態茺即可明瞭，前義國王及巴特里奧一派巳　受反軸心軍無條件投降之要求，今反軸心軍境公然要求沒收菲洲大陸之全部義領土，秘密企圖義國之全面解體，但自墨索里尼統帥被救出後，即以新法西斯共和政府主席資格，宣言三國同盟繼續存在，並表明義國民與盟邦各國相提携。共同繼續戰鬥之決意。墨氏巳於三國締盟紀念日召開新法西斯共和政府第一次閣議，但此等事實即將來之佳兆。過去一年可謂為激戰年，軸心軍收獲幾多重要戰果，同時遭遇若干挫折。反軸心以其一部之成功為基礎，動員一切宣偉機關，預報將來之勝利，甚而謂反軸心軍已獲勝利然吾於此願對德國民進一言且確信三國同盟之盟邦各國國民絕不為此種愚劣傲慢之宣傳所乘，三國同盟所屬各國國民約計二億五千萬人，現仍於歐洲及東亞為彼等之視國與自由，隨時譽備作最大犧牲。無　共產主義或民主主義均不能征服歐洲，或使東亞之日本崩潰。軸心海陸空軍之勇毅精神，在將來之戰鬥中，更將收獲且體之戰果。軸心軍不斷對敵軍加以攻擊，予以殲　打擊，使彼等認識此即擅自開戰之懲戒。將來此苛烈之鬥爭吿終，三國同盟各國分別建高新秩序，則可酬　其國民於戰塲或國內戰綫所負之幾多犧牲。盟邦各國因此殆能取得其　國國民將來之自由與幸福。戰事勝利操諸我人之手，乃吾人絕對不拔之信念，本日欣逢三國同盟三周年紀念日　對陸海空三軍之　功傽續，表示感謝，吾人忠誠團結擁　指導者，俾爭取最後勝利。</p>

<h3>昨孔誕紀念　文廟舉行祀孔　大典儀式荘嚴肅穆</h3>

<p>紀念意義</p>
<p>略謂：今天是先師孔聖誔辰紀念，上海特別市政府舉行秋祭之日，我們為什麼要在孔子誕辰舉行紀念，當然是景仰先師孔子，因為我們每一個人自糼至老，均深受孔子之敎，而其眞義在於學術，不但用於人生的問題，且的於國家政治的問題。自日常起居以至於國家行政，槪括全都人生，以禮樂射御　數六藝為基本學問，作敎育之根本，進而用於政行於國，退而删詩書訂禮樂，求學術之進步，研究學問。學以致用，用在做人，學術政治合而為一，彼此相濟，使　個人生含蓄於學校之中，自糼即從　樂射御書數　小處做起，培植人材，為學以致用，養成個人高尚的人格，　　的學問，以用於國家人生的事業。孔子以於周時未統一之學識歸統起來，再　中庸之道來處理一切，活用學問是孔子最高的精義，也是我人數千年來　以師事者，不但中國一國認為孔子學識是顚　不破的，即整個東方學術也尊以為源，因為孔子學術乃　世師表，因此每逢孔誕，輒祀而祭之。頃槪括言之，聊為紀念孔子的報告。旋由孔聖學會及　　學會代表孫德餘講演孔子事略後，即唱孔子紀念　，攝影禮成。</p>
<h3>廣田情報部長　談美經濟策略　企圖奪取全球經濟統治權</h3>
<p>中央社訉　日大使館情報部長廣田，於昨日招待外籍記者時，宣稱，如渝方仍不覺悟美國欲於戰後握余球經濟　權之明顯策略，則中國將受英美經濟上之束縛，廣田氏於痛詆美國　下之奪取全球經濟統治權之企圖時，謂美國慷慨以鉅款借與反軸心陣營中他國之作用，僅為共欲於戰後擴大　土及經濟勞力之護身法耳，目前護自美國各種資助者，包括蔣介石政權在內，均將無　償清此項債務，此點因美國由於第一次大戰之經騐所深知者也。然美國目前所為者，正欲利用此項無力賠償之弱點，以進行其「經濟陰謀」，此已可由最牸美國行政方而大規模之改組證明之，即重慶方面，對美國在渝方統制下之中國之投資態度，亦相懷疑。渝方機關報「中央日報」最近之社評中，會　告中國人民　認清美國在中國增加投資資金之舉動，其動機非在為謀華人之利益，而實為美國之利益着想，故華人必須謹慎從事，勿為美國在華之經濟政策所欺。方於新近閉會之國民黨「第十一次中央執行委員會」，會通過　案一項，決定渝方對外國借款投資表示歡迎，惟渝方亦　勵華人與外人在私人　業上之密切合作，此項議案乃渝方外長宋子文在美國活動之結果，反之，亦可表示渝方對外國在中國投資之眞實用意尚未明瞭也。最近美國行政方面之改組，以戰時生產局四處歸併於克勞　所領導之國外經濟　理局中，適足以表明美國欲握戰後世界經濟霸權之奢望，此種奢望，更以副國務　章爾斯之辭職，而以前租借法局主任史丹蒂組斯繼任相考證，則愈　明顯矣，因史氏乃於目前美國外交政策着重於經濟方面時，較為適宜於副國務卿一席也。</p>

<p>絲廠業·絲號業·綢縀號業等同業公會，為主要商品之移動事宜，頃　根據　時物資移動取締暫行條例，及主要商品登記規則等法，　市商會轉呈行政院及實業部，依法救濟，其理由如下：主要商品係本年五月三日實業部通告規定之十八種物品，（絲及絲製品亦包括在內，）是本市經濟局訓令市經四字第三十六號所定，應領移動許可證者，絲及絲製品當亦包括在內。籍查本年三月十一日，　府公布之戰時物資移動取締暫行條例第六條之規定，絲及絲製品並不在內，其後實業部復於本年五月三日通告所規定之主要商品表內，則將絲及絲製品列入第七項，但查閱戰時物資移動取締條例第六條原文，物資之搬出入上海地區，而須申請許可者，仍以該條例和六條規定之品目為限。絲及絲製品旣未列入上開條例第六條，其在三省二市，及本埠移動，自無申請可，及傾取移動證書之理由，殊為彰明。故全國商業統制　會，對於絲及絲製品，會函絲綢業周業聯合會，絲　及絲織品。綢緞在三省二市，或本市移動。依　戰時物資移動取締暫行條例之規定，可毋須經由本會許可，擋安案俱在。不難複按。即查本年五月十一日，實業部頒布之主要商品登記規則第六條之規定，亦僅為登記事項有變更，或消滅時，應由申請人依照第四條第一項規定之程序，按月呈報當地主管官　，並未有主要商品之移動，須於事前呈請當地主管官署發給移動許可證之規定。　思政府對於　咨統制之法令，當以戰時物資移助取締暫行條例，及主要商品登記規則為繩準，各地主管官　對於物資之管理，亦僅能　照上開條例及規則所定之辦法施行，如有逾越中央頒行條規之行為，即屬違反法令。値此戰時體制推行之際，尤盼地方官署均能恪守中央法令，而奉行中央之政策，方能收政策統一之效能，本會根據法令所定辦法，認為上海特別市經濟局訓令，舉辦主要物品移動許可一事，乃屬抵觸中央法令自應請求轉呈行政院糾正」。</p>

<p>經濟界　言評</p>
<h3>浮動游資的歸宿</h3>
<p>前茲上海物價之　瞻。究其基本原因，除非淺視的觀察家，無不知為輸人銳減，工業不振，幣値低落，物資購囤等等原因而外，游資之膨脹，實為其基本原因之一。</p>
<p>白從儲備券成為華中　南統一通貨以來，儲備劵的發行額，即隨以急速增加。本年春末以至初秋，因先后收貿小麦，棉花與米等農產物，會使大量儲券，流入內地農村，旋復還流而至上海，或滯為銀行之活期存款，或作為商工業之持有資金，然以上海金融　關，直至過去一個多月為止，在實施統制上，並不充分，以致浮動游資，形成無所歸宿的狀態，而其最惡劣的現象，則為浮動游資之流入歧途—投機，囤積，以至烟窟賭塲的幾條路上，徒使人民大衆蒙其損害，受其荼　，　之痛心。</p>
<p>以戰時　　的常理而論，生產如能增加，則通貨額雖見增加，不足為痛，反之，則為浮動游資之永無歸宿，最近兩個月來，由於政府強化統制，高呼生產，益以金融機關夏行自　，遂使歧路盡成「路不通行，」一般人君投資者，至此雖欲　正路而不由，亦不可得。</p>
<p>因此，今日復業的上海　商證券所，自應因綠環境以努力增加流　各項生　證劵，促成浮動游資的正常歸宿，為其復業後之最大責任，尤其要使有所依宿以扣的社會資金，悉得為適合沿於戰時經濟之運用，所以，對於上塲證券，是萬萬不可不加以嚴格審查的。</p>
<h3>粉麦專委會商妥　小麦移動辦法　憑許可證發票稽查</h3>
<p>粉麦專業委員會與中國銀行團及日商銀行成立十萬萬元小麦貨款後，業已實施統收三省兩市之小麦，各麵粉廠訂立配麦公約，各委託商訂立收麦公約以及貼現契約，關於小麦移動手續，業經粉麦專業委員會與地方　食局協商，茲為便利採販集中來源，凡由農村採運至市塲者，自應予以絕對自由，但為免除走漏便於稽查起見，已訂立左列各辦法。</p>
<p>向上海方面搬入者，以商統會核准發給之許可證，同時須有粉麦專業委員會加需證明登記章，　在省境內移動者，以各地區公會會員商行之發票為憑，該發票規定以某某省某區雜糧業同　公會會員年開之發票為限，註明會員證號數小麦數量價格，以及運輸方法經程等。　在三省兩市（上海區除外）境內移動，應由各該地區同業公會，及粉麦專業委員會各地辦事處證明，經各該省市糧食局核給之許可證為憑，日商由領事館許可轉知糧食局。</p>
<h3>油專會完成　收買機構</h3>
<p>商統會油紀專業委員會，因雜糧出新期近，故對於準備開始萖買之各項機構，亦已完成，茲經記者探得詳　如次：</p>
<p>收買雜糧種類驚多</p>
<p>按此次油糧委會收買之油糧，係包括一切之雜　　糧（除米麦）計：　雜糧為豆類（大豆小豆錄豆）及苞米高粱。　油肥原料為熒種，榷　，落花生，胡　油，桐子，柏子。　雜骨類為牛骨，豬骨等。</p>
<p>十一地區設辦事處</p>
<p>又該會為便利賣買貯藏輸送及其運他之必　起見，於上海，蘇州，無錫，皖北（蚌埠）鎭江，南京，芜湖，安慶，烹興，泰東及通海（南通海門）十一地區委員會辦事處推進一切業務上必要項，另於所屬地域添成分辦事處，以增加收買之圓滑化。</p>
<p>收　系統分三階段</p>
<p>至收買方面，大　分三系統即委託商，收買商，及油糧行。由委託商負收買責任，將收買資金貸與收　商，再由　買商向各地油　行取得合作。從事收買，故委託商必須擁有相當資金，方可担任，至收買商自身，亦自以能有現金為最合恪，如此　庶可與委託商及油糧行均能融通合作。</p>
<p>中日雙方各設公會</p>
<p>又據日方報紙記戰，油糧委會下部組織，日本方面由華巾日本油糧同樂組合聯合會在上海，蘇州，無錫，鎭江，南京，芜湖，杭州，　興，泰縣，南通，常州，蚌埠，安慶，及東合等十四地區，分設日本油糧同業組合，華方則分　蘇浙皖雜糧同業分會聯合會，　蘇浙皖食油業同業公會　合會兩部，再　分下部機構云。</p>

<h3>一個文書練習生的生活</h3>
<p>— 陳雪</p>
<p>我服務在綢　，業已二年多了，記得是去年的十二月，我被公司當局調到了新興的實業公司中，那時的欣喜，非可言喻的了。</p>
<p>我是一個練習生。練習了快要三年了，我自已知道。得　的有限，可是社會的人情世故，使我明白了許多。</p>
<p>我練習文書，文書是關於秘更室，也同時屬於總　課，我們的機　雖然是商業化的，可是一等因奉此」「准函前由」「應即遵辦」「合即筋查」等官樣文　是隨時可見，我們辦文書的分三步手　，收發·校對·簽蓋，和善通沒有什麼不同。</p>
<p>我因受秘書股長們的敎訓，耳沾目染的　陶「官樣文章」也會寫寫了，忙和閑還覺調劑得宜，所以對於工作，　感到興趣。</p>
<p>生活呢？我們膳宿是供給的，搖鈴吃飯，天黑去睡，米價的漲落煤球的買得着與否，我們這一　是案來不問的。</p>
<p>膳宿之外，我有百多元津貼可拿，在我個人無家庭負担，尚夠化用。</p>
<p>查官业公司的宗旨，是在扶助工商實業的發展，我希望公司當局能澈底做到。</p>
<h3>不幸者的學府　記盲童學校（二）</h3>
<p>盲童敎室的奇觀</p>
<p>盲童學校的學生，編制和普通學校相仿，自初小一年級至初中三年級，每級有級任敎師，負責敎導，敎師大部份也是盲者，第一級或兩級，另有不盲的監護者，監護盲童的　食起居。</p>
<p>小學部獨占一幢洋房包含各級　室，雨天游息室等。一二年級的楊先生正在敎習字，敎師口誦　正確的國語，學生即奪　疾　，奇怪的是他們用的不是毛筆石筆鉛筆或鋼筆而是錐子一樣的鐵筆（和寫　紙的筆相價，但筆桿很短），而在紙而和紙底，又有一種特製的　工尺具，彷彿手工用的銅，作長約一英尺，寬約一英時，分上下剛片，上片有　框；下片有凹點，恰似裁　司務用的「項針一一般，不過也以六個凹點為基　，　字時把紙片夾在上下兩銅片之間，即中鐵錐打下符號。在理想中，拼音打字一定很慢，但實際上孩字們的手不停的震　　，一行一行的很快就記錄下敎員所說的文句了。</p>
<p>三　四年級在自修，　童們靜　地摸索着大大小小的書本，不很困難的念着。有幾個學生在一手摸着書頁上的盲文，一手在抄錄下來，看來和我們不盲者的抄書沒有什麼兩樣。五六年級，都分班　敎授，因為盲童敎育比較困難，每班至多不能超過十人，盲敎師都很很辛的苦講解着。有一班在敎算术，黑板　筆　在這　都不　要，日用敎科書和紙上的演算。但是據說任何複離高深的敎學，仍能和非盲人一樣的敎學。另一班　語課，一位盲生站着背誦一篇長文，抑揚的聲調，了解的表情，幾乎像在朗誦小說和詩歌一般。</p>
<p>初中三年級的敎學，課程和普通學校一樣。此外自三年級起，另設有女學部，專收女盲童，編制分　　男生相同，不過另估一幢獨立的洋房，和男生分別　養。由一位在加拿大出身的返國華僑葉　華女士監護着，她叫一位女盲童任意抽出幾本書來，兩手的食指，像什麼昆蟲的觸　那樣。又像紡織　上的一對梭子那　迅速地在書上移動，同時就朗誦出一首英文歌和中國古詩，奾那正確而清朗的聲調，用力地終止在這一句上：</p>
<p>一少壯不努力，老大徒傷悲！」</p>
<p>藝與印刷部</p>
<p>盲童學校的學生，邵在　力學習，實在用不到傷悲。</p>
<p>除了從初小到中學的九級學科之外，另有工藝部，印刷部以及其他工藝敎育。</p>
<p>工藝敎育方面，有縫級·編結·打字及籐竹器械等等。縫級科由專門技師敎授　以女生為主要　象，裁剪好了之後　敢她們縫製，成　和非盲人所　一樣，編結科，現在女學部的女生都在忙着工作，编结絨綫衫被手套補子等，看来都很精美，　不會　到出於育人之手的，以　還有編結網袋等，　在因為原料難得，已無形停順了。</p>
<p>打字室衷，陳列着許多打字機，一種是普通的製式，所異者打字時不用原稿。只用自己的腹稿，或聽別人的口述，就立刻迅速的打成英文，簡直是最　着的連記者，所有　校的一母英文函件，帳目等等，據說多數是由盲生打字的！除此之外，　有一種盲人特用的打字機，型式較為簡單，打出來的是盲字。</p>
<p>籐竹工藝，本來是該校生產性工作之一，一向設有工藝部，內宋主任主持，聘有技師吳大模等，積極推行工　制。以民國二十年而言，即有育工人十名，出品售　已逹四千二百餘元。其後更加擴充，並籌　市區分銷處，日在　島，南洋及歐美也開闢了銷傳市塲，獲得各方的讚美。可異自前年以來，因交通及原料困難，陷於停頓，現在只留下少數盲工的成績，自　　箱籠至桌椅榻凳之類，每一件都衷現出盲人美術的特點，引人讚　。</p>
<p>但最値得讚美的是盲童學校的印刷部了！它向由俞子英先生主持，主要工作是：一，編印盲人刋物，一種是「燈塔月刋」，為全國盲人　一的定期刋物，一向分送各　縣盲人學校及　盲團體，每期平均須印二百六十册，每册約十二頁。對全國盲人敎育，有推動啓發之功。另一種是　洲盲人基督敎徒的週刋，更有負　協助國際工作的令　。二·編印課本及參考書，如「盲字初階」，盲人用字典。樂譜及地圖等，為全國各地育校敎育工具唯一的供　者。可異因為經費困難及紙張缺　，現在印刷部的幾　專印育字的機器，　蒙上厚厚的一　　塵，機器也有「髀　復生」之感啊！</p>
<p>文學音樂和盲傑</p>
<p>國民敎育工藝敎育　實習工塲之外，盲童學校更為培　育　中的專門人材而特設各種專科，會經出現渦不少「盲傑」—盲人中的英傑。</p>
<p>文學科，該校為　造就學生高深敎育起見，會自民國二十年　，提高各　課程標凖，俾學生　於智育方　，可盡　發展，初·高·初中各級的課程，不僅能與普通學校一致與衡接，並且力求超越。此外並特　師範科，以　有志於盲人敎育事業者獲得專門研究與實習的機會。至於宗敎事實方面，　何副校長說，該校完全採取信敎自由原則，所以師生中不一定限於基督敎徒，其間也有天主敎徒，　敎徒及無宗敎信仰者。不渦大部份是基督敎徒，所以也有主日學，早晚祈　會，勉勵會及其他宗敎聚會。</p>
<p>盲童學校的音樂科是很著名的。現在校　巔時一幢間樂之宮，衷面除了集　的音樂應之外，尚有特　　進的一小間一小間的音樂自修室，每間獨立，具備風琴鋼琴等樂器，大　音樂對育人有最大的安　　　　力吧，一早就有特別愛好音樂的盲生在練習了。音樂主任是盲目學者昌烈卿先生，據說從　原有音樂隊，由胡光僚先生仛指導員，道一樂隊　為各界所讚美，而該校盲生中並會發現不少天　，英國著名的「三一音樂院」前次到東方考選音樂遺材，即有該校盲童　少榮君等被考取了，受到國際的讚　。此外，該校盲生在大光明等處演奏，也常受　相當好評。可惜在上海戰事中損失了全部樂　，現在音樂隊無力恢復，只留下風琴班，鋼琴班和唱歌班了。但大禮堂上一個十零幾的女盲生　　者所奏那一曲綱琴的　　餘音，仍足以說明該校音樂科學生造詣之深。</p>
<p>盲傑在該校每一科別中發現着。</p>
<p>就以现在該校的敎務主任范福　來說吧，他是出　於母校的育生之一，由於自己的　力和校方敎育的得法，獲得深造的機會，他進聖約　大學以後，每　常列　茅，為中國盲人　得大學學位的第一人。而二十餘年來專心於育人敎育事業，茹苦含辛，不倦不厭，更令人敬</p>
<p>副校長何子健說，由該校轉入高中舉業的學生至今共有六·七十名，除了一部份在工商界服務之外，大多數在我國各地為發展盲人敎育事業而　　，近之如南京·杭州·紹興等地，遠之廣四·四川·雲南·青海和南洋各地，都有上海盲童學校學生在那衷推進盲人　養事業。到青海深入華四「少數民族」中去辦盲敎事業的江陰人羌紹幢先少也是該校畢業生呢。</p>
<p>由該校出身，進而完成大學敎育的盲生，約有十三四人，現在大　份也在敎育界服務，無不勝任愉快，受到各方　的　番。繼　在大學肄業的　不少。在民國二十六年秋季，盲童學校還會協助學業生　國彪赴美留學，專習盲人敢育事業，去年已告學成，異以戰時道阻，未能返國。</p>
<p>現在，誰說盲人中沒有非凡的人才？（未完）</p>

<h3>開發資源　增加農產（二）</h3>
<p>北海道</p>
<p>北海道的增强戰力，包括了台灣，庫頁島·四國·因為其面積廣大，所以更見得有力了。北海道廳，一而增產鐵，煤等五大主要產業，同時集中全副能力凍增加食糧生產，為求完成「食糧增產五年計劃」的目標起見，所以動員農民，此項計劃，創始於今年的春天，其中心是側重在改良土地事業，其事業費，由國庫支付，連續五年，總計約一億五千萬元，此項計劃成功後，約可增為一百五十萬石。</p>
<p>改良土地、是重要國策之一，在北海道方面，已由計劃的階段突入具體化時期。</p>
<p>設立「臨時北海道土地改良本部」作為實踐計　的指導機構，由坂道長官兼任本部長，石原振興部長、乾經濟部長為副本部長，岩岐簡任技師為技監，聘顧問三十三名，參事十六名，幹事三十九名，由幹事中指定擔任總務，工務，指導，勞務，資材，現業各部部長職務，皆在本廳服務，十四支廳，卽由支廳長兼任支部長，町村方面，由村長兼任實踐部長、農業團體長兼任副部長，分別負責指揮改良土地。</p>
<p>唐澤內務次官，對於北海道廳的措施，亦表示全面贊同略稱：</p>
<p>增加食糧生產，在於改良土地，因為這種理由，所以政府也決定支付　額預備金，作為改良土地的費用，以求食　生產的增加，不僅對北海道方面如此，卽其他府縣亦同樣做法，就勞力，資材，地域面積等等考慮而視，北海道最易實行，經費因為是屬於北海道拓殖費的，所以歸入內務預算之中，本省自當與北海道　打成一片，努力邁適。</p>
<p>防止水田荒廢</p>
<p>在此應該半記的，就是土功組合的整理問題，土功組合是維持設　農村建設根幹的道路，橋樑，堤塘等等的唯一機關。明治三十五年、根據北海道土功組合法創設，負責經營水田，此項組合、述年不斷產生，最多時有過二百五十家，近時因為收獲不豐，維持費增大，以致趨於衰落，現在所有之一百九十五家組合，其中有百八十家組合尙要負債，負債總額達二千九百萬元之多，其不景氣之狀况、亦云慘矣。大藏省已投資一千萬元於組合、北海道廳現在把整理土功組合這件事與改良土地同時進行，此次大藏省特派迫水總務局長與唐澤次官同行，就近檢討土功組合的現狀。</p>
<p>唐澤次官一行，實地詳察土功組合情形，目睹種種不景氣之實狀。衆認救濟這些些合的方策，就是組合歸國家管理，借款免息，開拓荒地。迫水總務局長，視察後的結論，略稱：</p>
<p>即使是不毛之地，現在也正是在設法增加食糧生產的時候，那末組合的事情，就應該　重考　的了、荒廢的原因有種種，但我以為主因還在於天時氣候，地理，與業者誠意如何？農業須要用　合的手段，組合不應任他負債、自當妥籌　策、助其成功，以求改良土地可以成功。</p>
<p>讀上面一席談话，可見當司關心土功組合整理問題的一斑。</p>
<p>行政協議會的效果</p>
<p>關於組合的整理問題，已有一綫眉目，幅員廣大的北海道，目下正向完成食糧增產五年計劃遇進，官民一體，開始　進，北海道與阿留審在指顧之間，這種「敵前增產」的緊張情形，為其他府縣所未見，在八紱學院、野幌機開學校受訓的靑年農村指導者，尤富於熱誠，前途有絕對的把握。</p>
<p>其次，視察北海道。庫頁島而令人感觸最深者，就是提供硏究材料，以資地方行政運用的北海地方行政協議會，全國九個地區的協議會，開始運用以來，已歷二月有半，雖已由試騐期而轉入積極活躍的階段，可是還不斷的有那種「不柔和的議論」，然而北海地區方面却不然，效力驚人，卞能百分之百的運用，對於行政的刷新强化，發揮絕大威力，無異對其他協議會給予一個標準，其理由就是　北海道，庫頁島兩廳與各特殊地方廳的管轄傴域一致，　南長官的綜合行政歡，比較其他府縣廣汎而有力，　北海道，庫頁島的物資交流，數量多而關係密，　在地理上具有北方根據地的共同性。尤其是八月十一，十二兩天的兩廳　聯絡協議會上，北海道　提出：「確立將北海道，庫頁島打成一片的食糧自給圈，本來庫頁島的不足數量約六十萬石、北海道約六十萬石，今後不要依靠本州、決定由北海道設法求其自給。地方行政協議會亦承認此項提案，已着手輸送，勞力的融通，農業技術的交換，逐步獲得成效。</p>
<p>充實北海道庫員島人口</p>
<p>總之，北海道，庫頁島現在正傾全力以求增加食糧生產，戰力物資，然而為求它能成為她方的一大兵工廠，更為完成國家的使命起見，亟盼能實現下面幾項政策。</p>
<p>要確保北海道五百萬，庫頁島一百萬的人口—人力資源不足，是北邊戰力的最大問題。</p>

<h3>對於處理公文的觀感</h3>
<p>— 方正毅</p>
<p>公文，就是政府機關裏施行政事的文書，文書的　成、便是檔案，故無論關於一切政治　施，以及對於人日各種申請的事案，必有各項依據法令的文書存案，惟其因為政府機關一定要以文書的傳遞，作為施行政事的憑籍和稽考，因此對於處理公文的遲速與繁簡，便會直接或間接影響到人民的福利問題，這裏筆者把我對於處理公文的實地認識數點，約略分述如次，以供參考。</p>
<p>我們知道政府機關是為人民而服務的，所以也可以稱為公務機關，公務機關對於一切政治設施，自有各種法令可資依據，而一般而接為民服務的事務機關，對於人民申請的各種事案，自應依據法令的規定、和適應事勢之需要，迅即批復申請人，似不能置之案頭而無限期的延擱，縱使對於人民申請的事案，而於法令上發生若干疑問之時，亦應儘先呈請上級機關詳細解釋後，然後再根據上級機關的解釋文，從速投復申請人，這樣，才能稱為名符其實的公務機關，可是事實上的表徵，是怎廖樣呢，筆者於此，實在覺得難以解釋這個答案，因為裏面的複雜問題，更使我無從講起，不過我還是希望一般公務人員，須要自肅自愛，不要給人民留存着一種惡劣的印象、語云：「高以下基、宏由纖起」，我們要希、政府能修明政治，遠是在各個公務人員的自肅自愛上做起，同時更深望政府當局，對於處理公文的程序，亟須加以改善，並嚴加規定處理每文件的收到和發出的日期，以免人民受到意外的痛苦、增加意外的損失。</p>
<p>其次，就是關於事權的統一問題，我們知道一般公務機關，往往有一個通常的弊病，這個弊病，便是在於事權的不能分淸，致造成有利則不約而趨、遇事則相率而避的局面，更有若干事務機關、因為事權的不能統一，竟在同一的事案之內，發出互和矛盾或性質相同的重複政令，一捐兩徵，時有所聞，使一般對於公文常識欠缺的人民，就要發生莫大的疑問，甚至有無所滴從之苦、乃不得不轉輾請托，或假手於人，因此勞心耗財，弊　業生，直接影響人民的福利問題，至　且鉅，這種情形，實在是政治上的一種病態，我們窮源竟委，亦不外乎是利害上的爭奪，但不能因此爭奪而使人民精神上和物質上受刊莫大的損害和　苦，故深望政府當局、應將這秤不合理的病態、加以改善、同時將各個事務機關的職權，嚴密的加以釐定和劃清，務使事權統一、各有專貴，如此則爭奪規避的弊病，自可無由發生了，而人民對於政府所拍的功令，也可以遵守無疑矣。</p>
<p>再次，要講到公文的本身問題了，我國的公文程式、大家都知道是紆迴曲折的、雖有一度的改革，仍不免有欠妥善、我們可以看到每一公文，經過了幾次「等因奉此」「等由准此」或「等情據此」承上接下的轉變，便會使讀者如墮入五里霧中，不裏面的原文、是由於何所發，此在一般老於文者，亦必詳細審閱後，能知道裏面的根源，那麼對於一般公文常識不甚健全的人民、自難判別其原委了、還有一個缺點，便是公文裏的措詞、圓滑空洞，一無邊際，使人看了，無從捉摸，例如關於件人民呈請事案的文件，主管機關、須要徵詢其他機關的意見，然後才能批覆具呈人，則主管機關，自應除叙述其他機關的原文外，再詳細開示自己的批覆立意、使具呈人有所遵循，不能僅僅照錄外來機關的原文，就來一個「……等由准此，査此案　據該民呈請有案、茲准前由，合行批仰知照此批」等一套漫無邊際的刻板文章，更有一般貪懶的擬稿老，對於外來機關的原文，明明可以採取簡叙法，但是因為他們的節用腦力，一定要把外來機關的原文、從頭至尾　述一下，然後再裝一個呆板的頭脚、便算了事，可是像　種濃泡式的公文，一定會使人有看不淸分不明的地方，而一般核稿的秘書科長們，也是簽了一個字或蓋了一個章，便算任務完舉，這種現象、亦應加以改革一字簡意賅」就是處理公文的主要，多用前叙法，少灌濃漿水，　是合乎正軌之道，我們更希望政府當局，對於改革公文的簡單化，應從速進行，處理公女的手續，如能力求簡單，則行政效率方面，一定可以提高了。</p>
<h3>添設深夜自警團</h3>
<p>— 張惠南</p>
<p>本巿自舉辦保甲自警團以來，其站崗時間，大多都在白晝和子夜前，且崗位都在沿街，似欠妥當，今就管見所及，聊誌數點於後：</p>
<p>白晝男子大多出外工作，有時與站崗時間，不免發生衝突。</p>
<p>白晝眼目衆多，失竊之事究竟比較夜深為少，所以此後不妨在夜深時添設自　團一項。此舉之最大目標為防止盜竊、在時間上不至會和工作發生衝突，又可為取締巿民乘　夜閒時緊賭之惡現象。關於添毅夜深自警團應　意之點：</p>
<p>團員須年靑之壯—。</p>
<p>崗位應設於弄口，（多惠隨　堂之大小而定），團員在罔時須來回不　視察崗位附近：尤其是弄底陰暗處。</p>
<p>每一崗位至少須團員二人，以備不測時可以對付，在深夜也不至感到寂寞。</p>
<p>團員严禁大聲說話或歌唱，以免篤醒住民，為竊賊所聞而有所準備之</p>
<p>市民如有聚賭者，團員有命令其立即停止之資格，若有違抗者，可報吿就近警察署，此點可謀都巿夜深之安寗。</p>
<p>團员絕對不可代替，以重責任心，否則如有失竊事項，經査明確實後，該團負須負相當責任。此議即能實施，白書之自警團員不妨由年紀較大白有空者任之，以補人事之不　。</p>

<h3>街上的騙局</h3>
<p>— 韓洪榆</p>
<p>在五方雜處的上　，騙局是到處都有，在現在秋深的時候，騙子們就拿應時的物件在街頭巷尾出現了。例如有種絨綫衫，價格很是低廉，化了廿餘元的代價，就可以買到一件，五花顏色都有，表面上看來是很美觀，攤頭上還寫着「火燒一二字，表示那衫廠是被火燒了，還　燒　的廉價出售了的意思，那也是騙子們的狡計，不識貨的人為了價格便宜，又聽他們花言巧語，就買了下來，到了家裏你若仔細野起來，就可看出那衫是用紙綫織起來的，穿了一次。那紙　就會斷了，結果是一無所得！希望社會各界人仕注意，不要上常！</p>

<p>月　，北站曾有小偷專取旅客行李之黨發見、但被警局方面加以注意符、目下已經絕跡。日昨　者赴校時路過三十馬路大新街口，見有一小孩，（約十歲左右，衣　整潔。）在前奔逃，後隨一人，大呼「捉牢他」·當被　人所拿、該孩即袖出鈔票一捲，跪在地上，苦苦哀求。後經路人　告失主。念他人小，不加追究。</p>
<p>聞該小偷、法甚巧妙：日穿知衣老，必相對而跑，故意一撞，　鈔巳出袋，往往人不注意。不料此次該人袋口甚小·被倫之時、覺袋有所動。視之，不見財，則疑該孩所為也。因此人事先、亦早有聞得　此之事，　嚴防之。</p>

<h3>The Trends of the Chongqing Regime (Part 2) — A Question and Answer Between Mr. A and Mr. B</h3>
<p>B: So, the Chongqing regime has encountered extremely difficult situations in dealing with the Communist problem and the trend of public opinion. Now, please tell me about the economic situation.</p>
<p>A: Of course, the economic crisis is one of the fatal crises for Chongqing. On the one hand, it wants to prolong the war, and on the other hand, it has to beg from Britain and the United States. What kind of situation is this? Luo Guofu commented on the crisis in Chongqing in this respect, saying: "Chongqing has not completed its task of establishing its wartime economy. It possesses all the raw materials for military needs on its own territory, but it has not carried out large-scale construction because the industrial and financial circles would rather engage in 'national disaster profiteering' and are unwilling to invest capital in the armaments industry. Those who unscrupulously make 'national disaster profits' put forward such a theory: the people are tired of war! Therefore, the people's needs for goods must be satisfied first, etc. This situation has weakened the combat effectiveness of the army and made it more dependent on the supply of British and American military supplies. Since Japan's war with Britain and the United States, this aspect has encountered serious difficulties."</p>
<p>B: Luo Guofu's remarks are naturally made from the perspective of a communist, but...</p>
<p>A: That's right, we don't need to discuss Luo Guofu's position, but pay attention to the facts he listed. What he said at least gives us a glimpse into the economic crisis Chongqing is facing today. In fact, Chongqing itself admits it. It is said that during the "Third Session of the Second National Political Council" in Chongqing, there was an incident of criticizing economic policies. The main points are: The coordination of industrial construction is not appropriate, resulting in abnormal development, such as the stagnation of steel production, which is a major crisis for the future of industrial construction. The problem of lack of funds. The problem of complicated loan procedures. The problem of nominal profits and actual taxes. The problem of factories hoarding raw materials. The problem of social floating capital avoiding industrial investment. The problem of disputes between "state"-owned and private enterprises.</p>
<p>B: Indeed, some economic figures from the interior have various painful complaints. However, hasn't Chongqing recently been promoting the success of its commodity price and material policies as a prerequisite for the success of the entire wartime economy?</p>
<p>A: Yes, Chiang Kai-shek had a "proposal to strengthen the control of materials and prices" and promoted how complete its contents were. However, it is said that various criticisms were raised during this "National Political Council," stating that not only had the plan not been effective since its implementation, but also phenomena contrary to the expected results had occurred. The reasons are roughly: Local governments failed to conduct detailed investigations on the supply and demand of materials in various regions and coordinate them uniformly; There were insufficient preparations for the implementation of "price limits." The authorities' materials were insufficient, and the merchants' prices were inaccurate, resulting in disturbances everywhere. The control only extended to the control of "points" and neglected the control of "surfaces," so the basis established by the "points" could not be maintained. More importantly, Chongqing's financial policy did not match its economic policy, such as arbitrarily raising tax rates and increasing the prices of public utilities.</p>
<p>B: I heard that Chongqing has recently implemented the so-called "monopoly system." What is the result?</p>
<p>A: It is said that since the implementation of this monopoly system, the wide disparity between the purchase price and the selling price has aroused controversy from all sides. In fact, there are too many things that have caused a bad impression among the people. Let me give a few more prominent examples:</p>
<p>The price of cotton yarn is extremely chaotic. However, due to the unfairness of the control, the people are not convinced, and most cotton merchants in various places refuse to comply.</p>
<p>The purpose of raising public debt was originally to tighten currency circulation and increase financial resources. However, since last year, compulsory quotas have been implemented, and the principle of fairness and universality has not been followed. Wealthy households have mostly found ways to avoid it, and only the middle and lower classes have suffered.</p>
<p>The original purpose of the establishment of the "Trade Commission" was to adjust export trade and encourage production in the rear. However, in reality, overseas transportation routes have been shortened, exports have stagnated, and the agency's expenses are huge, wasting "national funds." Moreover, the purchase price is extremely unreasonable, which has suppressed the people's enthusiasm for production, resulting in a decrease in production.</p>
<p>B: But, wasn't the so-called "developing the Northwest, building the Northwest" widely promoted in Chongqing?</p>
<p>A: Because there was no way out for the entire economy, the so-called Northwest policy was put forward. However, the situation in the Northwest is special. First, there is the international problem, involving the opposition between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain; second, there is the political problem, involving the relationship between Chongqing and the Communists; third, there are the ethnic and religious problems. The Northwest is a region where the Hui, Uygur, and Mongol ethnic groups predominate, and Muslims are absolutely dominant. Chongqing's management must first solve the above problems. However, in reality, there are many problems. The first is the problem of talent for border management, the second is the transportation problem, the third is the mechanical problem, and the fourth is the funding problem. These problems cannot be solved perfectly, so so far, in addition to investigations, studies, and planning proposals, there has been no significant progress. Even in terms of agricultural reclamation, the construction of water conservancy and transportation requires huge amounts of funds and a large number of talents. Moreover, the earliest harvest will have to wait five or ten years. It's really "a drop in the bucket."</p>
<p>B: Since Chongqing has no solutions for military, political, economic, and public sentiment trends, isn't that an opportunity to promote overall peace?</p>
<p>A: In theory, such a conclusion can be drawn, but as pointed out in the "On Overall Peace" article in the Shanghai News Weekly Review, due to Chongqing's international relations, due to the faction backed by Britain and the United States in control of the regime, due to the support of the Whampoa Clique with military control, and even more so because the forces of those who understand Japan have not yet risen, the Chongqing regime can still maintain its position by holding the "war of resistance" policy. Only after this situation changes, or only after this situation is changed by all means, can overall peace be achieved as a natural result. In short: the centrifugal force of the people under Chongqing's rule is developing, waiting only for changes in the international situation, waiting only for the political stabilization in the peaceful areas, waiting only for people's lives to be fully guaranteed, and waiting only for Japan's new policy towards China to be thoroughly implemented. At that time, overall peace will not be difficult to achieve, and the great cause of unified construction will be able to make great strides forward.</p>

<h3>Japanese Dispatch Army in China Announces Comprehensive War Results</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Dispatch Army in China announced the following comprehensive war results for August on the 28th: The land forces of the Japanese army fought the enemy 1,557 times, the enemy troops engaged in combat numbered 173,363, 7,510 enemy troops were killed, and 6,729 were captured and surrendered. The Japanese army also seized 9 various artillery pieces, 72 shells, 58 heavy and light machine guns, 796 rounds of ammunition, 3,344 rifles, 1,884 rounds of ammunition, 29 grenade launchers and pistols, 54 rounds of ammunition, 7,152 hand grenades, 650 bayonets and swords, and many other communication materials, gunpowder, horses, clothing, etc. The air force of the Japanese army shot down 35 enemy planes, one of which was unconfirmed. The Japanese side suffered 320 deaths and three planes were self-destructed or did not return. The main external affairs operations of China in August were as follows: Since July 10, the remaining Chongqing army in the southern Taihang Mountains has continued to be wiped out, led by the 27th Army of Jin. The commander of the Chongqing Reserve 8th Division, Lieutenant General Chen Xiaoqiang, was captured, and the army was completely defeated, frustrating its attempt to rebuild a guerrilla base in North China. Since July 27, an attack was launched on the troops of Yu Xuezhong in the Yingsu theater. Near Weishan Lake, they were surrounded, and their main force, the 111th Division and the 114th Division, were severely damaged and defeated. The communist army of Jin-Chahar-Hebei Province, led by Nie Rongzhen, recently attempted to move in the Mengjiang North China area. After the Japanese army launched a communist suppression campaign, its northern stronghold has been destroyed. In addition, the Japanese army was able to preemptively strike and severely damage the communist army's movements in North China, achieving great results. The characteristics of the August war results are as follows: The total number of engagements between the Japanese army and the enemy was 1,557, of which 826 were against the communist army, accounting for approximately 53%. The number of enemy troops engaged in combat was 173,363, of which 74,188 were communist troops, accounting for approximately 42%. The number of enemy troops killed was 7,510, of which 2,889 were communist troops, accounting for approximately 38.4%. Of the 6,729 captured and surrendered by the Japanese army, 1,545 were communist troops, accounting for approximately 24.4%. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese army's communist suppression campaign has been significantly strengthened, especially in the North China region. Of the 173,363 enemy troops deployed in combat, 14,239 were killed, captured, and surrendered by the Japanese army, accounting for approximately 61%. In particular, the increase in the number of prisoners and surrenders proves that the enemy's will to fight has declined and its combat power has weakened. In addition to attacking air force bases in Jianou, Hengyang, Guilin, etc., the Japanese air force has also engaged in active operations and intercepted attacking enemy aircraft, achieving great results. On the 23rd, a surprise attack was launched on the Chongqing base, which made the enemy tremble. In addition, the North China region closely cooperated with the southern Taihang Mountain operation, making it easier for the land forces to attack.</p>
<h3>Japan Decides to Convene Extraordinary Session of Diet in Late October; Cabinet Approves Establishment of Ministry of Munitions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In order to thoroughly implement measures to strengthen the domestic situation, the Japanese government decided to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet and establish a Ministry of Munitions at a cabinet meeting held on the 28th. The reason for deciding to convene the Diet this time is that it intends to submit legal bills and budget bills required for implementing measures to strengthen the domestic situation. This extraordinary session of the Diet will be the sixth under the Greater East Asia War and the fifth under the Tojo Cabinet. The goal of establishing the Ministry of Munitions is to quickly increase munitions production and expand air force strength by mobilizing national power, and to unify the ordering of munitions production and the administration of munitions production management. Therefore, the Planning Board and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will be abolished, and the Ministry of Munitions will be added on November 1 to integrate production administrative organs. The Japanese government, regarding the importance of enhancing munitions production, has renewed the production administrative structure, and since last year, it has implemented administrative simplification, established a temporary production enhancement committee, and formulated wartime laws such as the special cases of wartime administrative powers, the cabinet advisory system, and the establishment of a wartime administrative consultation council, a local administrative consultation council, and the implementation of administrative inspections, and other necessary important measures have been gradually implemented. These measures are aimed at preventing delays in wartime production. Therefore, it mainly focuses on personnel renewal and strives to avoid reconstruction. However, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has gradually become a Ministry of Munitions. At the same time, the production administration must establish a genuine decisive battle posture. Therefore, the Japanese government officially decided at the cabinet meeting on the 28th to establish the Ministry of Munitions as a fundamental measure to promote the current production administration.</p>
<p>Diet Session Scheduled for Three Days</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese government decided to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet and establish a Ministry of Munitions, two important measures that the Japanese Emperor has already approved. The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 5 p.m. on the 28th as follows: It was decided at today's cabinet meeting to request the opening of an extraordinary session of the Diet. The date for convening the extraordinary session of the Diet was set for October 25, and the session is scheduled for three days. The purpose of the convocation is to submit legal bills and budgets to show the Japanese government's firm will to complete the war to the domestic and foreign fronts. The expected proposals are as follows: Budget bill. Legal bills: (A) Proposal on budget simplification; (B) Proposal on judicial simplification; (C) Proposal on munitions accounting; (D) Proposal on strengthening air defense; (E) Proposal on continuing the duties of re-elected members of the Diet; (F) Proposal on amending the Conscription Law.</p>
<p>Planning Board and Ministry of Commerce and Industry Abolished</p>
<p>The bureau announced a proposal regarding the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions. Based on the force of the situation, efforts will be made to actively increase munitions production, and at the same time, in order to expand air combat power, a Ministry of Munitions will be established to ensure munitions production. As a result, the Planning Board and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will be abolished. In order to thoroughly simplify munitions production management, it was decided to transfer necessary management services for the main munitions production of the army and navy to the Ministry of Munitions for management. After the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions, matters related to national mobilization and munitions production, and other matters under the jurisdiction of the Planning Board and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, will be mostly transferred to the Ministry of Munitions. Of the matters related to munitions production that are under the jurisdiction of other provinces, the necessary ones will be transferred to the Ministry of Munitions. After the abolition of the Planning Board, comprehensive adjustment matters related to the national policy of both material and spiritual aspects will be operated simply and forcefully by the cabinet. Matters related to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that have little to do with munitions production will be handled separately. Consider hiring current military officers (including civil servants) from the army and navy as officials of the Ministry of Munitions. The organization plan of the Ministry of Munitions is based on extreme simplification. The Ministry of Munitions is scheduled to close on November 1, and related parties are rapidly preparing.</p>
<h3>Summary of Control and Allocation of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth; Secretary General Yuan Talks About Key Points</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Materials Control Review Committee has carefully studied the allocation method of cotton yarn and cloth after it is purchased in the Shanghai area. The seventh committee meeting was held in Beijing on the 27th, and it was decided to submit the Outline for Control and Allocation of Cotton Yarn and Cloth to the council's superior office, which will be reviewed in the next review committee meeting and then promulgated and implemented by order of the Executive Yuan. Yuan, a member and secretary general of the council, explained the allocation policy to reporters after the meeting. The goal is to ensure that the purchase of yarn and cloth, the adjustment of commodity prices, the increase in production, and the stability of people's livelihood are consistent. The content of the Outline for Control and Allocation of Cotton Yarn and Cloth is roughly as follows: The purchase of cotton yarn and cloth by both China and Japan will be allocated entirely by the Shangtonghui [Trade Control Commission], therefore, the yarn and cloth purchased by Japan should immediately study the measures to transfer it to the Shangtonghui. The allocation is based on the principle of the Shangtonghui's subordinate agencies. This Shangtonghui should expedite the establishment and strengthening of local cotton yarn allocation organizations. The organization centered on the allocation of yarn and cloth is part of the Shangtonghui. Therefore, the profits and losses of the purchase price should be determined by the Shangtonghui. When it is necessary to export yarn and cloth, the Review Committee must be consulted and the Executive Yuan will make a decision. Regarding the removal of yarn and cloth to areas outside of Central China, North China, and South China, this year's project has already been decided and will be carried out according to the planned plan. The general allocation outside of Central China will be based on the principle of saving materials, determining the reasonable consumption of each person, and allocating according to the population of the peaceful area. However, special allocations are planned for military needs, important production, and patients. In order to consider the effective use of the main materials obtained, efforts will be made to reduce the above-mentioned allocations so that there will be no excessive allocations. A separate allocation plan will be made for those who use it to trade with the enemy. When formulating the allocation ticket system and determining the consumption of each person, the relevant administrative officials and the Shangtonghui will closely liaise to make a decision. The allocation price is based on the actual local price in principle, and a gradual commodity price allocation policy is adopted. After necessary procedures, the Shangtonghui will make a decision. When there is a surplus due to the above measures, in order to be fair, measures will be studied to announce its contents. Also, regarding the policy of its use, it will focus on rational use in order to adjust commodity prices, increase agricultural production, and stabilize people's livelihood. The control measures for the collection and allocation of cotton will be determined separately.</p>

<h3>Japan and Germany Strengthen Cooperation, Confidence in Victory Grows, Prime Minister Tojo and German Leader Exchange Congratulatory Telegrams</h3>

I pray for your success in your struggles and express my utmost respect for the bravery and skill of your armed forces.

The chaos caused by Italian traitors has now been eliminated, and the Fascist Republic government is determined to wash away this historical national shame with blood. Italian troops will join forces with German and Japanese troops to eliminate international conspiracies. The Fascist Republic government is determined to adhere to the Tripartite Pact to the end. This can be reported with comfort to our German and Japanese allies."</p>
<p>Exhorting the People to Strive for the Revival of the Motherland</p>

<h3>Germany Determined to Fight to the End for National Survival, Ribbentrop Broadcasts a Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop broadcast a speech at 7:30 PM yesterday, stating that the purpose of the Tripartite Pact is to restore the right to survival to the nations whose positions have deteriorated due to historical relations in the past, and to satisfy all the absolutely indispensable requirements of these nations. In the past few years, the impoverished nations have repeatedly endeavored to seek a peaceful resolution with the wealthy nations, but these negotiations have all failed. The countries that have consistently opposed these efforts are the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. What these countries are attempting is nothing more than to dominate and enslave the European nations, and the countries that want to conquer the world are the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, not the Axis countries. In particular, the communist country's intention to invade is the most obvious. Now, the communist ideology and military force are confronting the solid defensive lines built by the German army. If the German army does not completely eliminate the danger of communism, it will never lay down its arms. The United Kingdom and the United States are currently cooperating with the Soviet Union to attack Europe, but if the Soviets win, it will be a major disaster for the democratic countries. The people of the United Kingdom and the United States will one day realize that the country that can save Europe and rescue the democratic countries from this terrifying situation is the German nation and its allies. What kind of attitude the democratic countries will take towards Europe can be seen from their attitude towards the Italian people. The former Italian King and the Badoglio faction have accepted the Allied demand for unconditional surrender, and the Allies are openly demanding the confiscation of all Italian territories in Africa, and secretly plotting the complete disintegration of Italy. However, since Commander Mussolini was rescued, he has declared the continued existence of the Tripartite Pact in his capacity as Chairman of the new Fascist Republic government, and has stated that the Italian people will cooperate with their allies and continue to fight together. Mussolini convened the first cabinet meeting of the new Fascist Republic government on the anniversary of the signing of the three-nation alliance, but these facts are good omens for the future. The past year can be described as a year of fierce fighting, and the Axis forces have achieved several important victories, while also encountering some setbacks. The Allies, based on some of their successes, have mobilized all propaganda machinery to predict future victories, and even claim that the Allies have already won. However, I would like to say one more thing to the German people here, and I am confident that the people of all the Allies of the Tripartite Pact will not be swayed by this kind of stupid and arrogant propaganda. The people of the countries belonging to the Tripartite Pact number approximately 250 million, and they are still in Europe and East Asia making the greatest sacrifices for their countries and freedom at any time. Neither communism nor democracy can conquer Europe or cause Japan in East Asia to collapse. The courage and determination of the Axis's sea, land, and air forces will achieve even greater victories in future battles. The Axis forces will constantly attack the enemy, annihilate them, and make them realize that this is the punishment for launching the war without permission. When this arduous struggle comes to an end in the future, the countries of the Tripartite Pact will build a new order, which can compensate their people for the many sacrifices made on the battlefield or on the domestic front. The Allied countries will therefore be able to obtain the freedom and happiness of their own people in the future. The victory of the war is in our hands, which is our absolutely unwavering belief. On this day, we are happy to celebrate the third anniversary of the three-nation alliance. We express our gratitude for the achievements of the army, navy, and air force. We loyally unite and support the leader in order to strive for final victory.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Confucian Birthday Commemoration, Confucius Temple Held Sacrificial Ceremony, Ceremony Solemn and Reverent</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Yesterday was the anniversary of the birth of the Most Sage Teacher Confucius. All sectors of the city, as customary, raised flags in commemoration. Government agencies, organizations, and schools took a day off. The City Government held a grand autumn sacrificial ceremony at the Confucius Temple on Confucius Temple Road in the southern city yesterday morning. The ceremony was solemn and reverent, even more elaborate than the spring ceremony. The Confucius Temple was heavily guarded from yesterday morning. The Second Police Bureau of the City dispatched a large number of police officers, personally supervised by Chief Inspector Guo Shaoyi, to be on guard. Banners with white characters on a red background saying "The Great Way Prevails When the World Is Shared by All" were hung high above the main roads. Red and green slogans were plastered on the walls inside and outside the Confucius Temple. On the Dacheng Hall, there was also a red silk gold-letter banner with the words "Confucius Birthday Commemoration Ceremony," creating a magnificent atmosphere. Red candles burned brightly on the hall, and the aroma of incense filled the air. Fresh flowers, sacrificial animals, and fine wines and fruits were arranged on the table, showing the grandeur and meticulousness of the arrangements.</p>
<p>Solemn Sacrificial Rite</p>
<p>The prelude to the grand ceremony began at ten o'clock with the sound of bells ringing three times and the opening of the gate. The officials in charge performed their duties. The chief officiant, Mayor's representative Zhao Zunyu, together with the assisting officiants and participating officiants, entered the Dacheng Hall in an orderly manner. After taking their places, the national anthem was sung, followed by the first rendition of the Zhaohua Chapter. Accompanied by music, the entire assembly stood and paid their highest respects to the national flag and the spirit tablet of Confucius. As the first offering began, the music and dance performers sang the He Chapter. They performed the Wu Gong dance. The chief officiant and the assisting officiants, led by the master of ceremonies, proceeded to the spirit tablets of the sages, presented silk and wine, and then returned to their places. At this point, the Wu Gong dance retreated, and the Wen De dance advanced, followed by the second offering, singing the Yi He Chapter, and performing the Wen De dance. The chief officiant, etc., again proceeded to the spirit tablets of the sages to perform the second offering. Finally, the final offering was performed, singing the Chang He Chapter, and performing the Wen De dance again. After the final offering of wine, the ritual of removing the offerings was performed. The music and dance performers played the music for removing the offerings and sang the Chang He Chapter. The entire assembly stood and paid their highest respects. The music then resumed, and the De He Chapter was sung again. Thereupon, the Master of Ceremonies burnt the prayer, the Silk Officer burnt the silk, and the Wine Officer burnt the wine. The chief officiant, etc., respectfully proceeded to the burning site to burn the prayer and silk. The door bell rang, all bells rang, and the sacrificial rite was completed. Then, Pan Yigao loudly recited the sacrificial prayer to Confucius. After the reading, Secretary-General Zhao Zunyu, representative of Mayor Chen, reported the significance of the commemoration in the Dacheng Hall.</p>
<p>Commemorative Significance</p>
<p>He briefly stated: "Today is the anniversary of the birth of the Most Sage Teacher Confucius, and the day of the Shanghai Special City Government's autumn sacrifice. Why do we hold a commemoration on Confucius's birthday? Of course, it is to admire our teacher Confucius, because each of us, from childhood to old age, has been deeply influenced by Confucius's teachings, and their true meaning lies in academics, which are used not only for problems in life, but also for problems in national politics. From daily life to national administration, everything is encompassed, using the Six Arts of Rites, Music, Archery, Charioteering, Writing, and Arithmetic as basic knowledge, and making them the foundation of education. Further, they are used in government and implemented in the country. Retreating, he deleted the Book of Poetry, revised the Book of Documents, and established Rites and Music to seek academic progress and research knowledge. Learning is for application, and application is in being a person. Academics and politics are united as one, complementing each other, so that an individual's life is enriched in school. From childhood, one starts with the small things of Music, Archery, Writing, and Arithmetic, cultivating talents and learning for application, cultivating a noble personality and using learned knowledge for the cause of the country and life. Confucius unified the knowledge that was not unified in the Zhou Dynasty, and then used the doctrine of the Mean to handle everything. Activating learning is Confucius's highest essence, and it is what we have been learning from for thousands of years. Not only does China regard Confucius's knowledge as indestructible, but the entire Eastern academics also regards him as the source. Because Confucius's knowledge is a model for the world, he is sacrificed to and prayed to every time his birthday comes. Briefly summarizing, I report on the commemoration of Confucius." Then, after Sun Deyu, a representative of the Confucius Sage Association and the Xuewu Association, gave a speech on the events of Confucius's life, the Confucius Commemoration Song was sung, and a photograph was taken to complete the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Hirota, Head of the Information Department, Discusses American Economic Strategies, Attempts to Seize Global Economic Domination</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Hirota, head of the Japanese embassy's information department, declared when hosting foreign journalists yesterday that if the Chongqing side remains unaware of America's obvious strategy to seize control of the global economy after the war, China will be subjected to economic bondage by Britain and the United States. While vehemently denouncing America's attempt to seize global economic domination, Hirota said that the generous lending of large sums of money to other countries in the Allied camp by the United States is merely a guise for expanding territory and economic power after the war. Currently, those who receive various forms of assistance from the United States, including the Chiang Kai-shek regime, will not be able to repay this debt, a point that the United States knows well from its experience in World War I. However, what the United States is doing now is precisely to take advantage of this inability to repay to carry out its "economic conspiracy," which is already evident from the large-scale reorganization of the US administrative side. Even Chongqing is suspicious of America's attitude towards Chinese investment under Chongqing's control. A recent editorial in the Chongqing newspaper "Central Daily News" warned the Chinese people to recognize that the motive behind the United States increasing investment funds in China is not for the benefit of the Chinese people, but for the benefit of the United States. Therefore, the Chinese must be cautious and not be deceived by the United States' economic policies in China. At the recently concluded "Eleventh Central Executive Committee" of the Kuomintang, a resolution was passed stating that Chongqing welcomes foreign loans and investments, but Chongqing also encourages close cooperation between Chinese and foreigners in private enterprises. This resolution is the result of Chongqing Foreign Minister Song Ziwen's activities in the United States; conversely, it may also indicate that Chongqing's true intention for foreign investment in China is still unclear. The recent reorganization of the US administrative side, with the merging of the four offices of the War Production Board into the Foreign Economic Administration led by Crowder, is sufficient to show America's extravagant hope to control the world's economy after the war. This extravagant hope is even more evident when coupled with the resignation of Deputy Secretary of State Welles and the succession of Stettinius, the former head of the Lend-Lease Administration, as Stettinius is more suitable for the position of Deputy Secretary of State at a time when current US foreign policy emphasizes the economic aspect.</p>
<h3>Education Personnel's Second Discussion Group Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The City Party Headquarters of this city hosted a discussion group meeting for all education workers in the city.

<h3>Doctor Zhu Ziyun Subject to Suspension</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency Report: A reporter went to ask Director Fang Jufan of the Health Department about the case of national doctor Zhu Ziyun causing death due to professional negligence and how it would be handled. It was answered that the criminal part of the case has been handled according to the law. As for the part that violated doctors' rules, the current authorities have sent personnel to investigate and have now decided to impose a suspension in accordance with the provisions of Articles 12, 19, and 21 of the Provisional Rules for the Management of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and ordered the doctor's license to be submitted to the bureau for temporary storage. The length of the suspension will be determined after the court's verdict.</p>
<h3>Silk and Silk Products Should Be Allowed to Be Moved Freely, Silk Mills and Other Industries Petition for Relief</h3>
<p>The silk mill industry, silk shop industry, and silk fabric shop industry associations, regarding the movement of major commodities, have recently, based on the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Materials Movement and the Major Commodity Registration Rules, petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce through the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for relief according to the law. Their reasons are as follows: Major commodities are the 18 types of goods stipulated in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's notification of May 3 this year (silk and silk products are also included). According to the instructions of this city's Economic Bureau's Economic Affairs Fourth Department No. 36, those who should obtain a movement permit also include silk and silk products. Checking the provisions of Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Materials Movement promulgated by the government on March 11 this year, silk and silk products are not included. Later, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's May 3 notification of the list of major commodities included silk and silk products in item 7. However, reviewing the original text of Article 6 of the Wartime Materials Movement Control Regulations, those who must apply for permission to move materials into and out of the Shanghai area are still limited to the items stipulated in Article 6 of those regulations. Since silk and silk products are not listed in Article 6 of the aforementioned regulations, there is no reason to apply for or obtain a movement certificate when moving them in the three provinces and two cities, and this port. This is clearly demonstrated. Therefore, the National Commercial Control Council sent a letter to the Silk Industry Federation regarding silk and silk products and silk fabrics and satin moving in the three provinces and two cities, or this city. According to the provisions of the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Materials Movement, it is not necessary to obtain permission from this association. The case files are there and can easily be reviewed. Even checking the provisions of Article 6 of the Major Commodity Registration Rules promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on May 11 this year, it only stipulates that when there are changes or cancellations in the registration items, the applicant should submit a monthly report to the local competent authority according to the procedures stipulated in Article 4, Paragraph 1. There is no stipulation that the movement of major commodities must be reported to the local competent authority in advance to obtain a movement permit. It is believed that the government's laws and regulations on material control should be based on the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Materials Movement and the Major Commodity Registration Rules as the standard. The management of materials by local competent authorities can only be implemented in accordance with the methods stipulated in the aforementioned regulations and rules. Any behavior that exceeds the central government's promulgated regulations is a violation of the law. At this time when the wartime system is being promoted, it is hoped that local authorities can strictly abide by central government laws and implement central government policies in order to achieve policy unification. Based on the methods stipulated by laws and regulations, this association believes that the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau's instructions to handle the movement permit for major commodities is a contradiction to central government laws and regulations and should be requested to be forwarded to the Executive Yuan for correction.</p>

<h3>Grain Transportation in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces - Water and Land Transportation in All Rice-Producing Areas</h3>
<p>The transportation of rice and grain in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces is crucial to the food supply and common price for the citizens of Shanghai. The following is an investigation record: Liangxi in Zhejiang province and Songjiang, Jinshan, and Qingpu in Jiangsu province are all well-known rice-producing areas. They have many waterways connecting to Shanghai, which are suitable for boat transportation. Japanese ships transporting rice have a system of "guaranteed capacity," ensuring that losses are minimized within a certain limit. If the warehouses in Shanghai are located along the Huangpu River or Suzhou Creek, the rice can be directly unloaded into the warehouses after being loaded onto boats in the inland areas, making the process more convenient and reducing losses compared to transporting rice by truck. In Jiangsu province, Wujiang, Taicang, Wuxian, Changzhou, Jintan, Yixing, and Changshu are also rice-producing areas with many waterways connecting to Suzhou Creek, which are suitable for boat transportation. However, Changzhou, Yixing, and Jintan are far away. If using civilian boats, it takes a long time. It would be more convenient to transport the rice by short-distance boats to Danyang and Changzhou, and then transport it by train. Changshu, on the other hand, is located far from the railway lines and can only be transported by civilian boats. Rice markets in Anhui province are mostly concentrated in Wuhu. Rice-producing areas include Nanling, Chaohu, Hefei, Sanhe, Dangtu, Qingshuihe, Wuwei, Fanchang, Digang, Wuhu, and the local county. The waterways in the famous counties north of the Yangtze River can be used to transport rice to Wuhu by civilian boats. The famous counties south of the Yangtze River use both trucks and civilian boats. After the rice is concentrated in the Wuhu warehouses, it can be directly transported to Shanghai via the Jingwu Road, or loaded onto boats and unloaded at the Bund, depending on the quantity of rice and the smoothness of transportation. The above is merely a general description of the recent transportation of rice between various places and Shanghai.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>The Destination of Floating Capital</h3>
<p>Looking ahead to Shanghai's price fluctuations, the fundamental reasons, other than reduced imports, industrial stagnation, currency depreciation, and hoarding of materials, are obviously known to any observer and the expansion of floating capital is one of the fundamental reasons.</p>
<p>Since the Reserve Certificate became the unified currency in Central and Southern China, the amount of Reserve Certificates issued has increased rapidly. From the late spring to early autumn of this year, a large number of Reserve Certificates flowed into the rural areas due to the successive purchases of agricultural products such as wheat, cotton, and rice. These certificates then flowed back to Shanghai, either remaining as current deposits in banks or being used as working capital for commercial and industrial enterprises. However, the Shanghai financial authorities did not fully implement controls until the past month or so, resulting in a state where floating capital had nowhere to go. The most adverse phenomenon was the inflow of floating capital into wrong paths, such as speculation, hoarding, and even into opium dens and gambling houses, causing great harm and suffering to the people, which is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>According to common sense during wartime, if production can be increased, the increase in the amount of currency is not a concern. Conversely, the lack of destination of floating capital is a cause for concern. In the past two months, due to the government's strengthening of controls and calls for increased production, as well as the voluntary savings campaigns by financial institutions, the wrong paths have all become "roads that do not pass". Even those who want to get on the right path are unable to do so.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, which has resumed operations today, should strive to increase the circulation of various productive securities in response to the changed environment, and make the normal destination of floating capital its greatest responsibility after resuming operations. In particular, it should ensure that social capital, which has a destination, is used appropriately in accordance with the wartime economy. Therefore, the securities listed on the exchange must be strictly examined.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Special Committee Agrees on Wheat Movement Methods - Inspection Based on Permits and Invoices</h3>
<p>After the Flour and Wheat Special Committee and the Bank of China Group and Japanese Banks established a 100,000,000 yuan wheat loan, they have implemented unified collection of wheat in three provinces and two cities. The flour mills have signed a wheat allocation agreement, and the commissioned merchants have signed a wheat purchase agreement and a discounting contract. Regarding the wheat movement procedures, the Flour and Wheat Special Committee has consulted with the local Food Bureau. To facilitate the gathering of sources, the movement of wheat from rural areas to the market should be completely free. However, to prevent leaks and facilitate inspection, the following methods have been established.</p>
<p>For wheat moved into Shanghai, a permit issued by the Commercial Control Committee is required, as well as a proof of registration stamp affixed by the Flour and Wheat Special Committee. For wheat moved within the province, an invoice from a merchant of the local trade association is required. The invoice must be from a member of the local Grain Trade Association in a specific province and district, and must state the member certificate number, wheat quantity, price, transportation method, and route. For wheat moved within the three provinces and two cities (excluding Shanghai), a permit issued by the local trade association and the local office of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee is required, and the permit must be approved by the food bureau of the province or city. Japanese merchants must obtain permission from the consulate and notify the food bureau.</p>
<h3>Oil Special Committee Completes Purchase Organization</h3>
<p>As the new grain season is approaching, the Commercial Control Committee's Oil and Grain Special Committee has completed the various organizations that will be responsible for starting the purchase of grains. The reporter has obtained the following details:</p>
<p>Many Types of Grain to be Purchased</p>
<p>The oil and grain to be purchased by the Oil and Grain Committee include all types of grains (except rice and wheat). Grains include beans (soybeans, red beans, mung beans) and corn and sorghum. Oil and fertilizer raw materials include rapeseed, sesame, peanuts, linseed oil, tung oil, and cypress seeds. Miscellaneous bones include cow bones and pig bones.</p>
<p>Offices Established in Eleven Regions</p>
<p>To facilitate buying, selling, storing, transporting, and other necessities, the committee has established offices in eleven regions: Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Northern Anhui (Bengbu), Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Yixing, Taizhou and Tonghai (Nantong and Haimen). These offices will promote all necessary business matters in their respective regions, and additional branch offices will be established to increase the smoothness of purchases.</p>
<p>Purchasing System Divided into Three Stages</p>
<p>The purchasing is mainly divided into three systems: commissioned merchants, purchasing merchants, and oil and grain firms. Commissioned merchants are responsible for purchasing, and lend purchasing funds to purchasing merchants. Purchasing merchants then cooperate with local oil and grain firms to carry out the purchasing. Therefore, commissioned merchants must have sufficient funds to take on this responsibility. It is best if purchasing merchants themselves have cash so that they can cooperate with commissioned merchants and oil and grain firms.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Establish Associations</p>
<p>According to a Japanese newspaper report, the Japanese side of the Oil and Grain Committee is organized by the China Japanese Oil and Grain Trade Association Joint Council, which has established Japanese Oil and Grain Trade Associations in fourteen regions: Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Hangzhou, Yixing, Taixian, Nantong, Changzhou, Bengbu, Anqing, and Donghe. The Chinese side is organized by the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Grain Trade Association Joint Council and the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Edible Oil Trade Association Joint Council, which are further divided into lower-level organizations.</p>
<h3>Another Letter to the Industrial and Commercial Sectors</h3>
<p>To the esteemed gentlemen of the industrial and commercial sectors: As the Shen Bao observes that there have been many changes in Shanghai's industry and commerce in recent years, and to facilitate inspection and reference, it plans to compile a "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Directory". We are grateful to the various trade associations for providing information. Recently, we sent an open letter to the gentlemen of the industrial and commercial sectors, requesting accurate survey data, and we have received letters from various companies and factories providing detailed information, for which we are very grateful. To further expand the investigation, we have created a form (see the second page of this newspaper on September 20th; forms can also be requested by mail). We hope that the gentlemen of the industrial and commercial sectors will take the time to complete the form in detail and send it to us so that we can make detailed corrections during compilation. Whether you are a member of a trade association or not, and regardless of the size of your capital or the scope of your business, all industrial and commercial operators in Shanghai are welcome.</p>
<p>Respectfully, the Shen Bao</p>
<h3>Chinese and Japanese Merchants in Central China Establish Joint Association Regulations - Implementing Increased Production, Purchasing, and Distribution</h3>
<p>Under the control of the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association, Chinese and Japanese merchants in Central China, in cooperation with trade associations in China, have established joint associations and formulated regulations to connect and develop, and to seek the common interests of the industry.

The regulations of the Japanese Flour Milling Shanghai Area Trade Association Cooperative stipulate that the purpose is to assist the Chinese government in implementing relief policies and to promote the interests of the industry.</p>
<h3>Wool Production Increases in Central China - Leather Purchases Proceed Smoothly</h3>
<p>The Central China area's autumn wool harvest has increased this year due to the cessation of exports. However, prices remain high. The price of one "tianping" (99 catties) in the Hangzhou area is 4,000 yuan. Relevant parties are currently working on purchases.</p>
<p>To ensure the smooth progress of leather purchases, a new leather purchasing organization will be established, scheduled to be formally established by the end of October, with a capital of 10,000,000 yuan. Preparations are currently underway.</p>
<p>The previously established Japan-China Raw Hide Joint-Stock Company has been decided to be dissolved, and liquidation is expected to be completed by the end of October.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange to Hold Resumption Ceremony Today</h3>
<p>The Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, after receiving orders from the Financial and Real Estate departments to resume operations, has completed all preparations. It is permitted to hold a resumption ceremony at the exchange's market on Hankou Road at 10:00 AM today (the 29th). Once the review is complete, formal trading will begin immediately, initially focusing on bi shang stocks. The registration of listed stocks was closed yesterday, and the review will begin to approve qualified stocks for listing. The number of exchange brokers is tentatively set at 200, including the original 80 and 120 new brokers. The original brokers, such as Tongmao, have all made preparations for the resumption of operations. The exchange's staff has been decided, and former employees who have registered and are qualified have been notified to report to the exchange today, and will be officially reinstated on October 1st.</p>

<p>Public Life</p>
<h3>The Life of a Clerical Trainee</h3>
<p>— Chen Xue</p>
<p>I have been working at a silk shop for more than two years. I remember it was last December that I was transferred to the newly emerging industrial company, and my joy at that time was beyond description.</p>
<p>I am a trainee. I have been a trainee for almost three years, and I know that I have limited gains, but the ways of the world have made me understand a lot.</p>
<p>I practice clerical work. Clerical work belongs to the secretarial office and also to the general affairs section. Although our organization is commercialized, official documents such as "as instructed," "approved by the previous letter," "should be complied with immediately," and "should be investigated" are always visible. We handle clerical work in three steps: receiving and sending, proofreading, and signing and sealing, which is not much different from the government.</p>
<p>Because of the lessons taught by the heads of the secretarial section, I have been influenced and can also write "official documents." I can also adjust the balance between busy and idle, so I am interested in my work.</p>
<p>What about life? Our meals and accommodation are provided. We eat when the bell rings and sleep when it gets dark. The rise and fall of rice prices and whether coal balls can be bought are things we don't ask about.</p>
<p>In addition to meals and accommodation, I have more than one hundred yuan in allowance, which is enough for me to spend personally as I have no family burden.</p>
<p>The purpose of the company is to support the development of industry and commerce. I hope that the company can thoroughly do it.</p>
<h3>The School for the Unfortunate - A Record of the School for the Blind (Part 2)</h3>
<p>The Wonders of a Blind Children's Classroom</p>
<p>The student organization in a school for the blind is similar to that of a regular school, ranging from the first grade of elementary school to the third grade of junior high school. Each grade has a homeroom teacher responsible for instruction. Most of the teachers are also blind. The first one or two grades have a non-blind caretaker who is responsible for the students' meals and daily life.</p>
<p>The elementary school section occupies an entire Western-style building, including classrooms for each grade and a covered play area for rainy days. Mr. Yang, who teaches grades one and two, is currently teaching writing. The teacher recites standard Mandarin Chinese clearly, and the students eagerly listen. What's surprising is that they don't use writing brushes, slate pencils, lead pencils, or fountain pens, but rather an awl-like iron stylus (similar in price to a pen for writing Braille, but with a very short handle). For the paper, there is a specially made tool, similar to a tailor's measuring tool, made of copper, about one foot long and one inch wide. It is divided into upper and lower plates. The upper plate has a frame, and the lower plate has indentations, similar to the "marking pins" used by tailors, but based on six indentations. When writing, the paper is placed between the two copper plates, and then the iron stylus is used to strike down and create symbols. One would imagine that writing phonetically would be very slow, but in reality, the children's hands move incessantly, quickly recording line after line what the teacher says.</p>
<p>The students in grades three and four are studying on their own, quietly feeling their way through books of various sizes, reading without much difficulty. Several students are feeling the Braille on the pages with one hand and copying it down with the other, looking no different from how sighted people copy books. Grades five and six are taught in separate classes because educating blind children is more difficult. Each class cannot exceed ten students at most, and the blind teachers explain the lessons diligently. One class is learning arithmetic. Blackboards and pens are not needed here; they use textbooks and paper for calculations. However, it is said that even complex and advanced teaching can be done just as well as with sighted students. In another class, a blind student is standing and reciting a long passage for a language lesson, with intonation and an understanding expression, almost like reciting a novel or poem.</p>
<p>The curriculum for the third grade of junior high school is the same as that of regular schools. In addition, starting from the third grade, a separate department for girls is established, specifically for female blind students. The organization is the same as that for boys, but they occupy a separate Western-style building and are cared for separately from the boys. A returned overseas Chinese woman from Canada, Ms. Ye Runhua, oversees them. She asks a female blind student to randomly select several books. The student's index fingers move like the antennae of an insect, or like a pair of shuttles on a loom, rapidly moving across the pages while reciting an English song and an ancient Chinese poem. Her clear and accurate tone ends emphatically on the line:</p>
<p>"If you don't work hard when you are young, you will only regret it when you are old!"</p>
<p>Arts and Printing Department</p>
<p>The students at the School for the Blind are studying hard, so there is really no need to feel regret.</p>
<p>In addition to the nine levels of academic subjects from elementary to junior high school, there are also departments for crafts, printing, and other vocational training.</p>
<p>In terms of vocational training, there are sewing, knitting, typing, and rattan and bamboo crafts, among others. The sewing course is taught by a specialist instructor, mainly targeting female students. After the patterns are cut, they sew them together, and the finished products are just as good as those made by sighted people. In the knitting course, the female students are currently busy working, knitting woolen sweaters, gloves, and patches, which look very exquisite. It's hard to believe that they are made by the hands of students. They also knit mesh bags, but this has been virtually suspended because the raw materials are difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>In the typing room, there are many typewriters on display. One type is a regular model, but the difference is that the typists do not use original manuscripts. They only use their own mental drafts, or listen to someone else's dictation, and immediately and quickly type it out in English. They are practically the most skilled reporters! All the school's English correspondence, accounts, and so on, are said to be mostly typed by blind students! In addition, there is a special typewriter for the blind, which is simpler in style and produces Braille.</p>
<p>Rattan and bamboo crafts were originally one of the school's productive activities. There has always been a crafts department, headed by Director Nei Song, with the employment of technicians such as Wu Damu and others, actively promoting industrial production. In 1931, for example, there were ten students employed in the work program, and sales of products reached more than 4,200 yuan. Later, it was further expanded, and a sales outlet was planned in the urban area. Sales markets were also opened up in Japan, Southeast Asia, and Europe and the Americas, receiving praise from all sides. However, since two years ago, due to transportation and raw material difficulties, it has been suspended. Now, only a few achievements of the blind workers remain. From suitcases and trunks to tables, chairs, and stools, each item shows the characteristics of blind people's art, attracting praise.</p>
<p>But the most praiseworthy thing is the printing department of the School for the Blind! It is headed by Mr. Yu Ziying. The main tasks are: 1. Compiling and printing publications for the blind. One is the "Lighthouse Monthly," the only regular publication for the blind in the country, which is distributed to schools for the blind and blind organizations in various provinces and counties. An average of 260 copies are printed per issue, with about twelve pages each. It has contributed to promoting and inspiring education for the blind throughout the country. The other is a weekly publication for blind Christians in Asia, which is even responsible for assisting international work. 2. Compiling and printing textbooks and reference books, such as "Elementary Braille," Braille dictionaries, musical scores, and maps, which are the only source of educational tools for schools for the blind throughout the country. Unfortunately, due to financial difficulties and paper shortages, most of the machines in the printing department that specialize in printing Braille are now covered with a thick layer of dust, and the machines also have a feeling of "髀肉復生" (the flesh on the thighs growing back, a metaphor for being idle for too long).</p>
<p>Literature, Music, and Blind Talents</p>
<p>In addition to national education, vocational education, and practical workshops, the School for the Blind has also established various specialized departments to cultivate specialized talents among the students, and many "blind talents" have emerged – outstanding individuals among the blind.</p>
<p>In the literature department, in order to prepare students for higher education, the school has raised the standards of various courses since 1931, so that students can develop their intelligence as much as possible. The curriculum for elementary, high, and junior high school levels is not only consistent with and connected to regular schools, but also strives to surpass them. In addition, a special teacher training program is offered to provide those who are interested in education for the blind with opportunities for specialized study and practice. As for religious affairs, Vice Principal He Zihjian said that the school fully adopts the principle of freedom of religion, so the teachers and students are not necessarily limited to Christians. There are also Catholics, Buddhists, and those with no religious beliefs. However, most of them are Christians, so there are also Sunday schools, morning and evening prayer meetings, encouragement meetings, and other religious gatherings.</p>
<p>The music department of the School for the Blind is very famous. The school currently has a building that is a palace of music. In addition to the music equipment for gatherings, there are also specially built small music self-study rooms, each independent and equipped with organs, pianos, and other musical instruments. Perhaps music has the greatest calming and soothing power on education. Early in the morning, there are blind students who have a special love for music practicing. The head of the music department is Mr. Chang Lieqing, a blind scholar. It is said that there was originally a music team, with Mr. Hu Guangliao as the instructor. This band has been praised by all walks of life, and many geniuses have been discovered among the school's blind students. When the famous "Trinity College of Music" in the United Kingdom came to the East to select musical talents, some of the school's blind children, such as Shao Rongjun, were selected and received international praise. In addition, the school's blind students often perform at places such as the Great Light Cinema, receiving considerable praise. Unfortunately, all the musical instruments were lost in the Battle of Shanghai, and the music team is now unable to recover, leaving only the organ class, piano class, and singing class. However, the aftersound of a piano piece played by a dozen female blind students in the auditorium is still enough to demonstrate the depth of the students' achievements in the school's music department.</p>
<p>Blind talents are discovered in every department of the school.</p>
<p>Take Fan Fucheng, the current director of academic affairs at the school, for example. He is one of the graduates of the alma mater. Due to his own efforts and the school's effective education, he obtained the opportunity for further studies. After entering St. John's University, he was always at the top of his class and was the first Chinese blind person to obtain a university degree. For more than twenty years, he has devoted himself to education for the blind with all his heart, enduring hardship and tirelessly, which is even more admirable.</p>
<p>Vice Principal He Zihjian said that a total of sixty or seventy students have transferred from the school to high school and university. In addition to some who serve in the business community, most of them are developing education for the blind throughout the country. Nearby places such as Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Shaoxing, and distant places such as Guangdong, Sichuan, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Southeast Asia all have students from the Shanghai School for the Blind promoting the education of the blind. Jiang Shaocheng from Jiangyin, who went to Qinghai to start education for the blind among the "ethnic minorities," is also a graduate of the school.</p>
<p>About thirteen or fourteen blind students have graduated from the school and completed university education. Most of them are now working in the education field, all of whom are competent and happy, and have received praise from all sides. There are also many who are still studying at universities. In the autumn of 1937, the School for the Blind also assisted the student Xue Guobiao to study in the United States, specializing in education for the blind. He graduated last year, but has not been able to return to the country due to the wartime difficulties.</p>
<p>Now, who says there are no extraordinary talents among the blind? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Developing Resources, Increasing Agricultural Production (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Hokkaido</p>
<p>The strengthening of Hokkaido's war power includes Taiwan, Sakhalin, and Shikoku. Because of its large area, it is even more powerful. The Hokkaido Agency is increasing the production of five major industries such as iron and coal, while concentrating all its efforts on increasing food production. In order to achieve the goal of the "Five-Year Food Production Increase Plan," farmers are being mobilized. This plan, which began in the spring of this year, focuses on land improvement projects. The project funds are paid by the national treasury, totaling approximately 150 million yuan over five years. After the success of this plan, it is expected to increase by 1.5 million koku (石, a Japanese unit of volume).</p>
<p>Land improvement is one of the important national policies. In Hokkaido, it has moved from the planning stage to the stage of realization.</p>
<p>The "Temporary Hokkaido Land Improvement Headquarters" was established as a guiding organization for the implementation of the plan. The governor, Sakado, serves concurrently as the director-general, and the director of the Promotion Department, Ishihara, and the director of the Economic Department, Qian, serve as the deputy directors-general. Jian Iwakiri, a qualified engineer, serves as the chief engineer. Thirty-three advisors, sixteen councilors, and thirty-nine executive secretaries were hired. Among the executive secretaries, those who serve as the heads of the General Affairs, Construction, Guidance, Labor, Materials, and On-site departments all work at the agency. The fourteen sub-prefectures are concurrently headed by the sub-prefectural governors as the sub-prefectural directors. In the towns and villages, the village chiefs serve concurrently as the directors of the implementation departments, and the heads of agricultural organizations serve concurrently as the deputy directors, each responsible for directing land improvement.</p>
<p>The Vice Minister of Internal Affairs, Tang Ze, also expressed full support for the measures taken by the Hokkaido Agency, stating:</p>
<p>Increasing food production lies in improving the land. For this reason, the government has also decided to pay additional reserve funds for land improvement, in order to increase food production. This is not only the case for Hokkaido, but also for other prefectures and counties. Considering the labor, materials, and area, Hokkaido is the easiest to implement. Since the funding belongs to the Hokkaido Colonization Fund, it is included in the internal affairs budget. This province will naturally work together with Hokkaido to make efforts to advance.</p>
<p>Preventing the Abandonment of Rice Fields</p>
<p>What should be mentioned here is the issue of organizing land improvement associations. Land improvement associations are the only organizations that maintain roads, bridges, dikes, and other infrastructure that are the foundation of rural construction. They were established in 1902 based on the Hokkaido Land Improvement Association Law, and are responsible for managing rice fields. These associations have been continuously established over the years. At most, there were over 250. Recently, due to poor harvests and increased maintenance costs, they have declined. Of the 195 associations that exist today, 180 are still in debt, with a total debt of 29 million yuan. The state of their depression can be said to be tragic. The Ministry of Finance has invested 10 million yuan in the associations. The Hokkaido Agency is now carrying out the reorganization of land improvement associations at the same time as land improvement. This time, the Ministry of Finance has specially sent the Director-General of the General Affairs Bureau, Po Shui, and Vice Minister Tang Ze to accompany them, to examine the current situation of land improvement associations at close range.</p>
<p>The Vice Minister of Internal Affairs, Tang Ze, and his party personally and carefully inspected the situation of land improvement associations, and witnessed the reality of various depressions. They all agreed that the solution to rescuing these associations is to have them managed by the state, with interest-free loans and the development of wasteland. The Director-General of the General Affairs Bureau, Po Shui, summarized his conclusions after the inspection, stating:</p>
<p>Even if it is barren land, now is the time to find ways to increase food production. Then, the matter of the associations should be reconsidered. There are various reasons for the abandonment, but I think the main reasons are the weather, geography, and the sincerity of the operators. Agriculture requires cooperative means. The associations should not be allowed to be in debt. Proper plans should be made to help them succeed, so that land improvement can be successful.</p>
<p>Reading the above remarks shows the concern of the authorities for the reorganization of land improvement associations.</p>
<p>The Effect of the Administrative Council</p>
<p>There is already a glimmer of hope for the reorganization of the associations. The vast Hokkaido is now advancing towards the completion of the five-year food production increase plan. Officials and civilians are united and have begun to advance. Hokkaido and the Aleutian Islands are within easy reach. This tense situation of "increasing production in front of the enemy" is not seen in other prefectures and counties. The young rural leaders who are trained at the Hachinohe Academy and the Nopporo Machinery School are particularly enthusiastic, and the future is absolutely certain.</p>
<p>Secondly, what is most deeply felt by inspecting Hokkaido and Sakhalin is the Hokkaido Regional Administrative Council, which provides research materials for the application of local administration. The councils in the nine regions of the country have been in operation for two and a half months since they began to operate. Although they have transitioned from the experimental stage to the active stage, there are still constant "unharmonious discussions." However, the situation in the Hokkaido region is different. The effectiveness is amazing. They can be used 100%, exerting great power on the revitalization and strengthening of administration, and providing a standard for other councils. The reason is that Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the jurisdictional boundaries of various special local agencies are consistent, and the comprehensive administrative authority of the South Commander is broader and more powerful than that of other prefectures and counties. The exchange of materials between Hokkaido and Sakhalin is large in quantity and closely related. Geographically, they share the commonality of being a northern base. In particular, at the two-hall joint liaison council on August 11 and 12, Hokkaido proposed: "To establish a food self-sufficiency zone that integrates Hokkaido and Sakhalin. Originally, Sakhalin's shortage was about 600,000 koku, and Hokkaido's was about 600,000 koku. In the future, instead of relying on Honshu, Hokkaido will find a way to achieve self-sufficiency." The local administrative council also approved this proposal and has begun to transport it. The exchange of labor and the exchange of agricultural technology are gradually achieving results.</p>
<p>Enriching the Population of Hokkaido and Sakhalin</p>
<p>In short, Hokkaido and Sakhalin are now doing their utmost to increase food production and war materials. However, in order for it to become a major arsenal and to fulfill the country's mission, it is urgent to realize the following policies.</p>
<p>To ensure a population of 5 million in Hokkaido and 1 million in Sakhalin – a shortage of human resources is the biggest problem for northern war power.</p>
<p>Strengthening transportation – maritime transport is the path to developing the north, and it is hoped that the government will value it as a national issue and work hard to shorten the connection between Hokkaido and Sakhalin.</p>
<p>Localizing life – the people who move from Honshu, not to mention Hokkaido, even in Sakhalin, still have the same clothing, food, and housing. This point needs to be reconsidered, and a lifestyle that adapts to the local area must be realized.</p>
<p>The reporter saw the guidance of Hokkaido Governor Sakado and Sakhalin Governor Otsu, and also witnessed the current situation in the north, so he wrote this article to provide the central government with a mountain of stones from other mountains for promoting administration. At the same time, I hope that the development of Hokkaido and Sakhalin will always be based on a military position, the self-sufficiency of food, maritime transport, and the uniqueness of labor adjustment. Hokkaido's food plan is already in place, and Sakhalin's development plan is also awaiting the on-site investigation of the members of the Sakhalin Investigation Committee, and is expected to produce a huge amount of resources worth 2 billion yuan by the end of this year.

<h3>Reflections on Handling Official Documents</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhengyi</p>
<p>Official documents are the documents used by government agencies to administer affairs. The completion of documents is archiving. Therefore, whether it is about all political facilities or various applications from the public, there must be documents on file based on relevant laws and regulations. Because government agencies must use the transmission of documents as the basis for administering affairs and auditing, the speed and simplicity of handling official documents will directly or indirectly affect the welfare of the people. Here, I will briefly describe my practical understanding of handling official documents, for reference.</p>
<p>We know that government agencies serve the people, so they can also be called public service agencies. Public service agencies have various laws and regulations to rely on for all political facilities. General administrative agencies that directly serve the people should promptly respond to various applications from the public based on the provisions of laws and regulations and the needs of the situation. They should not be put on the desk and delayed indefinitely. Even if there are some questions about the applications from the public under the law, they should first submit a detailed explanation to the higher-level agency, and then promptly respond to the applicant based on the explanatory document from the higher-level agency. Only in this way can they be called public service agencies in the true sense of the word. But what is the actual manifestation? Here, I really find it difficult to explain this answer, because the complex issues inside make it even more difficult for me to talk about. However, I still hope that public servants will be self-disciplined and self-respecting, and not leave a bad impression on the people. As the saying goes: "High is based on low, and grand is started from small." If we want to hope that the government can improve politics, it starts with the self-discipline and self-respect of each public servant. At the same time, I also deeply hope that the government authorities will urgently improve the procedures for handling official documents and strictly stipulate the dates of receipt and dispatch of each document, so as to avoid unexpected pain and increase unexpected losses to the people.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the issue of unified authority. We know that public service agencies often have a common drawback, which is the inability to clearly divide authority, resulting in a situation where they tend to converge when there is a benefit and avoid each other when there is a problem. Even more, some administrative agencies, because of the inability to unify authority, issue mutually contradictory or identical duplicate government orders in the same case. Double taxation is often heard of, which causes great doubts among the public who lack common knowledge of official documents, and even suffer from not knowing what to do. Therefore, they have to ask for help from others, which causes them to waste their energy and money. The disadvantages are obvious, and directly affect the welfare of the people. This situation is really a kind of morbidity in politics. We trace the source and investigate the cause, and it is nothing more than the struggle for interests, but we cannot allow this struggle to cause the people to suffer great spiritual and material harm and suffering. Therefore, I deeply hope that the government authorities will improve this unreasonable morbidity and strictly define and clarify the functions of each administrative agency, so as to unify authority and have its own responsibility. In this way, the disadvantages of contention and avoidance can be prevented, and the people can comply with the government's orders without doubt.</p>
<p>Again, I want to talk about the official documents themselves. Everyone knows that the official document format in our country is circuitous and tortuous. Although there has been a reform, it is still not perfect. We can see that each official document has undergone several transformations of "etc. based on this," "etc. approved based on this," or "etc. according to this," which makes readers feel like they are lost in a fog. The original text inside is due to what was issued. Even those who are experienced in writing must carefully review it before they can know the source. Then, it is difficult for people who do not have a sound knowledge of official documents to distinguish the original situation. There is also a shortcoming, that is, the wording in the official documents is rounded and empty, without any boundaries, making it impossible for people to grasp after reading it. For example, regarding a document in which a person petitions for a case, the competent authority must solicit the opinions of other agencies before it can approve the petitioner. Then, in addition to describing the original text of other agencies, the competent authority should also clearly state its own approval intention, so that the petitioner can follow it. It cannot simply record the original text of external agencies and then use a set of stereotyped articles that are boundless, such as "...etc. approved based on this, it is hereby approved as previously stated, and it is hereby ordered to be notified and complied with." Even more, some lazy drafters, for the original text of external agencies, can obviously adopt the concise description method, but because they are economical in their mental energy, they must reiterate the original text of the external agencies from beginning to end, and then add a rigid head and foot, and then it is over. However, official documents like that must make people have unclear and incomprehensible places. The secretaries and section chiefs who approve the draft are also just signing a word or stamping a seal, and then they consider the task to be completed. This phenomenon should also be reformed. "One word is simple and concise" is the main thing in handling official documents. Use more pre-narrative methods and less irrigation of thick water. Only this is the right way. We also hope that the government authorities will proceed with the simplification of official documents as soon as possible. If the procedures for handling official duties can be simplified as much as possible, then administrative efficiency can definitely be improved.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Nighttime Self-Defense Corps</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huinan</p>
<p>Since our city began organizing the Baojia Self-Defense Corps, their guard duty times have mostly been during the daytime and before midnight. Moreover, the posts are all along the streets, which seems inappropriate. Now, based on my limited observations, I will briefly note a few points below:</p>
<p>During the daytime, most men are out working, and sometimes this inevitably conflicts with guard duty hours.</p>
<p>During the daytime, there are many eyes watching, and theft is certainly less frequent than late at night. Therefore, it might be advisable to add a nighttime self-defense corps. The greatest goal of this measure is to prevent theft, avoid conflict with work in terms of time, and also to curb the bad habit of citizens gambling during their nighttime leisure. Regarding the points to be noted when establishing a nighttime self-defense corps:</p>
<p>Members must be young and strong.</p>
<p>Posts should be set up at alley entrances (their quantity should be determined according to the size of the alley). Members must constantly patrol the vicinity of their posts, especially the dark corners at the alley’s end.</p>
<p>Each post must have at least two members, in order to be prepared for emergencies and so they will not feel lonely late at night.</p>
<p>Members are strictly forbidden from talking loudly or singing, so as not to wake residents and alert thieves to prepare themselves.</p>
<p>If citizens are gambling, members are authorized to order them to stop immediately. If there is resistance, a report can be made to the nearest police station. This point can help maintain peace and quiet in the city at night.</p>
<p>Members must absolutely not be replaced, in order to emphasize a sense of responsibility. Otherwise, if there is a theft and it is clearly investigated, the corps should bear considerable responsibility. If this proposal can be implemented, the daytime self-defense corps members could be appointed from those who are older and have free time, in order to make up for the lack of personnel.</p>

<h3>Street Scams</h3>
<p>— Han Hongyu</p>
<p>In Shanghai, where people from all walks of life gather, scams are everywhere. Now, in the depths of autumn, swindlers appear on the streets and in the alleys with seasonal items. For example, there are some woolen sweaters with very low prices. For about twenty yuan, you can buy one in various colors, and they look beautiful on the surface. The stalls even have signs saying "Burned by Fire," indicating that the sweater factory was burned down, and they are selling them cheaply. This is also the cunning trick of the swindlers. Those who don't know the goods, because of the cheap price and listening to their sweet talk, buy them. When you get home and examine them carefully, you can see that the sweaters are woven with paper thread. After wearing it once, the paper thread will break, and the result is nothing gained! I hope people from all walks of life in society pay attention and don't be fooled!</p>
<h3>Strictly Guard Against Thieves</h3>
<p>— Rong Xicun</p>
<p>Last month, a gang of thieves specializing in stealing travelers' luggage was discovered at the North Station, but after being noticed by the police, they have now disappeared. Yesterday, when I was going to school, I passed the intersection of Daxin Street on Route 30 and saw a child (about ten years old, neatly dressed) running away in front, followed by a person shouting "Catch him!" When the child was caught, he pulled out a roll of banknotes from his sleeve, knelt on the ground, and begged bitterly. Later, after passers-by informed the owner, he took pity on the child's youth and did not pursue the matter further.</p>
<p>It is said that the thief's method is very clever: he wears nice clothes and deliberately runs into people, and the money is out of the pocket before you know it. Often people don't pay attention. Unexpectedly, this time, the person's pocket was very small. When he was bumped, he felt something moving in his pocket. He looked and did not see his money, so he suspected that the child had taken it. Therefore, people have heard about this kind of thing beforehand and should be strictly on guard against it.</p>
<p>After the fact, it was revealed that many people have seen this incident. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to such children. If readers encounter such a thing in the future, do not be lenient because the person is young. You should hand him over to the police station to help break up the gang. This will not only benefit individuals, but also prevent these children from falling into a life of crime!</p>
