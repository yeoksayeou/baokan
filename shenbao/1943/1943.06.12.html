<h3 id="c1">當前中國經濟問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>全國經濟委員會爲適應參戰後的經濟任務，於本年二月閒實行改組，直接隸屬於國民政府，並於二月十二日舉行第一次全體委員會識，決定了戰時經濟政策綱領。　該會即將舉行二次全體委員會議，我們在該會第一次全會前一日，曾　誠　言，　望在經濟方面，確立戰時經濟國策，不只僅僅着眼於物資之收集與統制，而必須更積極的致力於增加生產，合理的增加農業生產，工業生產，以及鼓勵中小工業的生產，我們曾經斷言：「只有計劃的和有組織的推進增產運動，獎勵民間農工業的大小生產，才能保障參戰經濟政策之順利完遂。」到現在已經四個月了，目前國際局勢，已有極顯著的變化，主要的是由於北非戰爭的結束，就是說世界大戰已經更加迫近最大規模的決戰階段了，爲了希望大決戰中爭取決定性的勝利，以保障世界新秩序之建設運動，那麼，不僅要求軸心各國的戰鬥力的最大限度的緊張起來，並且更要求一切反英美國家的經濟力的最大限度的緊張，尤其在英美侈言歐洲開關第二戰綫，而他們在太平洋上的處境還陷於極端不利的今天，我們東亞各國，在經濟部門，趕快集結所有民間的經濟力，準備給予敵人以致命的打擊，澈底肅淸太平洋上敵人的殘餘勢力，爲東亞新秩序奠定不拔的基礎。在中國，經濟方面的任務，就是澈底完遂「戰時經濟政策綱領」，並適應新的情勢之需要而採行必要的方策。</p>
<p>首先爲我們所必須加强努力的，自然是增加生產。不過我們的目光，不只集注於上海及其四周，而且要注意到整個華中乃至華北華南各地區，不只集注在軍需的企業，而且要注意到民間的中小工業手工業以至農村副產業，特別要注意到各地農業生產的增進。關於這一方面，我們尙願竭誠期望於全經委會者有下列幾點：</p>
<p>一，對於工業之獎勵與扶助，應由理論政策而移爲事實，特別是：</p>
<p>（二）與國防有關的工業及重工業：</p>
<p>（二）活必需的工業應首先籌謀切實和普遍合理的獎勵與扶助。至於方法，自不外爲：</p>
<p>（一），使勿流入投機者之手：</p>
<p>（二）或給予必要的補助金：</p>
<p>（三）行或以種種方法借用低利貸款；</p>
<p>（四）給方面，應代爲徵集必要原料，减低或免除原料稅，以及减低原料運輸費用，給予運輸原料以種種便利：</p>
<p>（五）面加以指導，如派遣技術人員視察指導，代向友邦日本聘請技術人員，設立技術研究機關，獎助技術人員及發明家等：</p>
<p>（六）劑必要的動力，如由政府供給廉價的電力：</p>
<p>（七）及技術人員敎育訓練機關，舉辦勞工及技術人員登肥及介紹事業，改善及保障勞工之生活及健康，舉辦勞工利事業：</p>
<p>（八）品運銷上之便利與一定的利潤，防制非法收買，囤積，减低交通事業運輸費，統一檢騐機關。此外，對於中小工業及手工業等，允須加以注意而扶助之，鼓勵一般人民的增產熱情。</p>
<p>第二，是要努力於農業之獎勵與技助。我國原爲東亞最大的農業國家。同時，從國民經濟生活來說，農業經濟，實爲我國現代主要的國民經濟形態。然而，近幾年來，無席諱言的，由於戰事的影響，我國的農村經濟，不僅凋敝不堪，而且瀕於崩潰的絕境，因此，農產品的生產，實際上也有與年俱减之勢。加以若干地區，連年旱荒，土地拋置，農民流離，成千成萬的生產大衆，變成了游食分子。這種現象若不迅謀適當的對策，則不要說提供我們的農產原料以協力作戰，不要說提供我們的農村經濟力以協力共榮圈的建設，就連維持本國岡民經濟，以至僅僅維持本國農民經濟以茍延殘喘，恐怕已有憂憂乎其難之勢了。爲此，我們竭誠希望全經委會二次大會於今後如何護農民經濟，改善農民生活，獎勵及扶助農業生產，迅定萬全的政策，與政府協力求其實施。我們認爲最重要的是：</p>
<p>（一）推廣農業貸款，務使眞正進入生產農民之于，一方面防制土豪劣紳利用地位，借取大量資金去放高利貸，一方面防制農民用借得之款去納租還債還息，必須建立合理的信用合作，放寬扣保的條件，使貸款入於實際生產農民之手，並减低利息，輕其負担，提高其生產情緒。現在交通銀行已奉命進行農村調查，以爲舉辦農的準備，這種審愼認眞的態度，値得讚揚，不過以一行之力，未必能普遍，希望能推廣至江浙以外各地區。</p>
<p>（二）嚴密管制游資在農村的活動，導使眞正協助增產。如果「游資下鄉」，不是推動農業生產。而是收買十地，那末，其結果造成土地權的轉移，土地由生產農民小地主之手轉入安居上海等大城市的游資擁有者之手，十地權集中的結果，是新的大地主的出現，是自耕農和小地主數目的激减。這種現象，對於國家經濟是極大的危機，政府應迅速設法保障佃農的收租權，防制土地權之集中，與土地權投機行動，使農民保持士地安心增產。</p>
<p>（三）推進農村敎育，農民識字運動及大量培養農業技術人材，介紹友邦日本新農業的技術，生產方法及農業生產新工具，以改進我國之農業生產，提高其生產能力。</p>
<p>（四）推廣農村運銷合作事業，以避免商業資本的剝削。同時，必須改善農產品收買辦法，特別是必須改變農產品低物價的方針，盡力提高農產品的價格至合理程度，（提高直接收買價格，抑制農產品商販銷賣價格），只有這樣才能鼓勵農民增加生產的熱情而達到增加物資的目的。</p>
<p>第三，改善人民經齊生活，是目前與增加生產同樣重要，且是更根本的問題。一人民生活之困難，已經是無可否認的事實；在人民人人有不能維持其最低限度生活之際，而要求集中全國人力物力財力以協力大東亞戰爭與新秩序建設，實難求得實際的效果。至於目前人民最大的困難所在，一是物價問題之嚴重，二是各地災荒之迭發。爲此，我們認爲全經委會這次大會，更應確立改善民生的整個方案，，努力於法幣價値之穩定，物資生產之增加，交通運輸之便利，國民心理之導正，以及擴大救荒運動。現在河南·河北·山東·山西等地的早災尙未完全消泯，而華南潮汕一帶的災况又發生了，這種嚴重的災荒，一方面是大量災民流離死亡，另一方面也表現爲廣大災區工農生產之停滯，和非災地區物資與財力之消耗，因此，不合理的經濟及政治現象，加上了天災，造成了大災荒。同時，大災荒又會造成政治，社會，經濟上的危機。目前的救荒運動，具有着積極的意義。如果辦得好，就可以爭取　共政權下的民心，以造成全面和平。如果辦得好，更可以刺激人心，增加生產，充實物資，奠定今後建設的基礎。我們希望當局以最大決心，不惜資金，進行積極的建設性的救災，不僅使各地人民所捐出款項，完全切切實實的進入災民之手，爲其維持生活救濟病患之資，而且用以恢復田園，開荒築渠，改善交通，增加生產，務使無一文虛糜，無一文不收其應有的效果。我們深信，只要人民生活獲得改善，國家一切政策就可保證其貫澈實現的。我們願全經委會第二次全會獲得較第一次會議更大的成功，我們願政府以最大的決心與努力，使全經會的決議迅速和澈底的付諸實施。</p>

<h3 id="c2">戰時文化宣傳政策綱要要宣部長闡明目標　普及戰時意識動員文化總力　希望第四戰士負起執行責任 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>南京十一日中央社電昨晨十時半，宣傳部林部長接見中外記者，發表前日最高國防會議所通過之「戰時文化宣傳政策基本綱要」，首先指出此綱要之最大目標，在普及戰時意識，集中力量，完遂大東亞戰爭，並就國民政府政綱第十條，中日基本關係條約第二條，東亞聯盟四大綱領，及新國民運動綱要，與本綱要之係，分別加以扼要之說明。林部長並謂完遂亞戰爭爲當前第一要務，必須在精神上物質上的力量，同時並舉，物質力量有所未逮，精神力量尤爲重要，必須發揮精神力量，乃能增强物質力量。論及本綱要之內容時，林部長指出方面，在淸釐英美及共產主義之毒素思想，積極方面，在重建中國及東亞之文化，遠在民九年汪主席在「兩種模型心理之瓦解」一文中，即指示中國思想之動向，此思想動向，今於大東亞戰爭中乃得具體之實現。林部長又謂和平運動，不僅爲一種外交上的工作，並且爲具有實踐性的思想運動，大東亞戰爭不僅爲武力戰，並且爲心力戰，戰爭之目的，不在破壞，而在建設。「戰時文化宣傳政策基本綱要」卽養眼於此，末謂國民政府頒布此綱要之後，希望第四戰士擔任宣傳報道工作諸同志，依此綱要，加緊宣傳，尤須以身作則，努力執行，蓋第四戰士諸同志，實爲執行本綱要之第一責任者，必須率先實踐，推己及人，允望友邦文化宣傳方面，予以協力。</p>
<p>南京十一日中央社電　關於戰時文化宣傳政策基本綱要，日前最高國防會議業經通過，送由國民政府頒布施行。戰時文化宣傳政策方針中，有詳細闡明，即在動員文化宣傳之總力，担負大東亞戰爭中文化思想戰之任務，與友邦日本及東亞各國盡其至善至大之力，期一面促進大東亞戰爭之完遂，一面力謀中國文化之重建發展，及東亞文化之融合，與創造，而貢獻於新秩序之世界文化，其要點計分七點，分七部份，最主要者，爲一認定大東亞戰爭之完遂，爲一切東亞理想實現之前提，國家集團主義爲東亞新秩序建設之凖則，而爲實現以上兩大目標則以國父遺敎三民主義及其重點大亞洲主義，爲興復中華保衛東亞之最高指導原理，二，揭發英美主義之罪惡，因英美百年以來，對中國以至東亞，除經濟軍事政治種種侵略以外。在文化上尤盡其思想麻醉之能事，近百年來一般人均有依賴英美之卑劣心理，此種心理，一日不除，實爲建設東亞新秩序建設之妨碍，故特以揭發英美主義之罪惡，列爲　二點，其次自事變來人心頹　萎靡，故第四點熱量出應根據新國民運動綱要，剷除此種頹廢及種種享樂心理。又中國本有極高深之文化但近年以來却崇拜外來文化，而忽視我國固有文化，因是第五點即在復興國有文化，吸收外來文化，並糾正盲目復古及崇外排外之錯誤思想，以強化中國文化之基幹。又鑒於近年以來，其所以衰弱，固有種種原因，但科學落後，實爲最大原因，第六點即特別注重青年之科學敎充，謀技術訓練。再以我國文化向極散漫，其指導方針，在集中並培養人才，第七點，即集中文化人材，團結文化力量，調整文化事業，確立文化宣傳總力體制，以動員全部文化工作從業者，從事有組織文化工作之建設，關　實施部份計分十部，均已定明日公佈，此次戰時文化宣傳政策之實行，與我國文化以至東亞文化乃至東亞新秩序之建設，均息相關，故今後之從事文化工作者化不但以此爲準繩，即我國人亦應本此方針，身體力行，庶可達到興復中華保衛東亞之使命。</p>

<p>漢口十一日中央社電華中派遣軍於此次夏季進攻作戰中，將渝第六戰區軍計十七個師覆滅，當達成作戰目的後，欲返原防之際，渝直系第七十九軍長夏楚中所部之新銳部隊，突形出動，進抵宜都正面，採取追躡之勢態，日审察知後，常即對之反擊，未戰片刻，渝軍即行潰去，是役夏楚中所部之渝第九十八師，於本月曾進抵宜都南方八公里附近，日軍於五日黎明出動，是役正午即佔領募旗山，（宜都南方十一公里）據巴山山脈之嶮峻猛攻之，渝軍於六日即遭擊潰，同時與此相呼應自某方開始進攻之日軍某部隊，在枝江附近，亦包圍渝第一百九十四師，將其擊潰，更急追渝暫編第六師直至石家河附近，仍將其粉碎。</p>

<p>南京十一日中央社電　駐華日本派遣軍報道部十一日發表一週戰况，謂最近每當作戰結束之際。渝機即行出動，以爲所謂初次夏季攻勢，渝機亦曾出動，且美駐渝空軍亦與渝方空軍在共同協力下，實行遊擊戰，然由此種共同作戰，足可窺知美國之居心，顯欲使渝方空軍受美空軍之指揮，又由於其始終實行遊擊作戰，不敢與日空軍對壘，允足證明日軍已確保制空權，渝方以地上隊部不能應付日機，預料將使全有力機隊，急遽出動，故日陸機隊乃先發制人，即于六日猛炸梁山，炸毀渝機二十餘架，是日並空襲恩施，擊落渝機一架，復於九日空襲建甌，炸毀該地機塲之各種設施，而把握制空權。又六日渝方（魯蘇戰區）魯南總指揮部總指揮榮子恒中將，率部二萬參加和運，榮中將所率之第一百一十二師及第一百一十四師，均係舊東北軍，自滿洲事變，發生以來，即從事抗日戰爭，迄今已十二年，今旣參加和運，故影響舊東北軍之抗戰心理至深且巨。溯自國府參戰以來，華北方面之渝軍將領來歸者，計有吳化文，李永平，厲文禮，龐炳勛，孫殿英將軍等，此足證渝軍抗戰意志之低下，及國府政治力量之日形增强。</p>

<p>南京十一日中央社電　據確息：中共方面前在延安舉行中共首腦部會議後，即命令林彪軍之主力及賀龍軍之一部，自前綫移動於陜甘寗邊區，開始一大規模之軍事警戒行動，渝「軍事委員會參謀總長」何應欽，「副參謀總長」白崇禧，於本月八日曾聯名致電朱德毛澤東。質問中共中央部任意移動軍隊之理由，並要求中共方面，即時停止邊區附近具有對抗性之軍事行動，然中共軍之移動，並不因渝方干涉而停頓，邇來依然繼續進行中，傳渝方現正於蘭州西安洛陽三地，同時舉行各戰區作戰檢討會議，基於渝「軍事委員會」指令，刻正討論對中共軍之具體警戒措置。又渝政界對此次事態動向極重視，認中共方面對渝中央方面之要求，，將出以何種態度，或將使問題更趨複雜云。</p>
<p>張家口十一日中央社電　最近渝共相尅又趨激烈，蒙疆伊盟所屬黄河南岸札薩克旗保安隊，因受共產黨之煽惑，會於三月二十五日發生暴動，因此陜北地區渝共之相尅互　，遂普遍展開，其演變頗堪注目。</p>

<p>阿根廷京城十一日中央社電阿根廷新政府於十日發表，國內航空公司均包容於陸軍內，置於軍當局管理下。阿根廷新外長斯特爾尼海軍少將十日曾接見美國新聞記者團，闡明阿根廷外交方針稱：阿根廷對歐洲各國尤其對義。英及西班牙等國，決維待友好關係，新政府並根據具體之方策，用全力保全泛美。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十一日中央社電　阿根廷新政府八日復繼續召開閣議，並已決定對內對外政策，內政方面似將徹底從　革新，八日閣議終了後，政府發表公報稱：關於减低食糖價格之各種計劃案，二三日內即由關係部長提出，關於促進以救濟失業爲目的之公共事業計劃及减低房租等案，亦已經閣議決定。司法兼敎育部長阿那亞八日會見記者團時，曾說明政府施政方針，謂政府決掃除過去立法機關之一切腐敗，關於敎育政策，亦將基於澈底實施弛阿根廷敎育方針，調查國內各大學及其他學校，新政府對於國內行政黨態度，似頗冷淡，此點殊堪注意，八日解除戒嚴令後，阿根廷京城內之官衙警戒兵亦均撤去，市面已恢復常態，但議會則仍被封鎖，禁止參衆兩院議員入院，因此可知新政府對於政黨似頗具反感。</p>

<p>二，以確立科學技術總力爲方針，在國家統一計劃之下，集中並培養科學人才，動員並增進技術能力。</p>
<p>三，掃除玄虛忘誕之觀念，普及科學智識，提倡科學精神，特別注重靑年之科學敎育與技術訓練。</p>
<p>（說明）近代科學文明，爲集合全部人類之貢獻，應爲世界所公有，中國對世界文化之創造與發展，曾有偉大之貢獻，今後更應有有效之運用與發揚，近年以來，提供科學，雖已爲國人所　公認，然玄虛妄誕之觀念未除，科學智識之普及朱周，科學技術無從掖進，爲完成戰時體制及文化建設小拔之基礎，必須以科學技術爲中國文化之重建與發展之重心，以振發國民的科學精神，而謀科學劃期之發達與技術飛躍之改進。</p>
<p>（七）集中文化人才，團結文化力量，調整文化事業，確立文化宣傳總力體制。</p>
<p>（要目）一，所有文化面之人力，物力，及各種事業機構，均應爲合理之調整與編配，統合於全團唯一的綜合組織之下，以共同的努力，諜計劃的發展。</p>

<p>三，以此機構統合各種文化事業，及其從業者，規定其應有之職責，予以合法之權益及保障革除過去組織散漫，意見分歧，利害衝突之積弊。</p>
<p>四，認定此機構及其所統屬之事業，爲國家公有事業，非個人管利之結合。</p>
<p>（說明）我國文化組織向極散漫，文化思潮之起估，文化事業之興廢，聽任文化界之自由，國家對於文化之指導方針，雖有所規定，而對於文化事樂之推進，則尙缺有系統之規劃。以致文化思想紛然雜亂，無所歸一。共產主義文化，國際侵略主義文化，復古落伍思想，甚至誨淫海盜之作品，茲輾轉傳誦，貽害國民思想，實深且鉅，考其原因，要爲自由放任主義爲之作祟，文化界因受個人自由主義之毒，誤認思想發表，可放任個人自由，文化作品之販賣，亦只以營利爲目的，其對國民將受到如何之影響，絕不感覺共責任，此固文化思想之錯誤，而國家文化體制，尙未確立對於文化事業，及文化會工作既不能爲嚴正之督導，又不能爲有效之保障。坐令其各自爲謀，實有以致之，至於文化組織，因受個人自由主義及資本營利主義之流毒，往往疊床架　，同一性之小團體，小機關，小企業，不知凡幾，互相競爭，互相摧殘破壞，使有用之材，互相抵消於無用，不但個人資本財力之損失，抑亦國家文化總力量之損失，文化事業中，有從事經營之企業家，有從事心力之文化人，及從事勞動力之職工羣，此三方面，如不以最高之指導原則爲之綜合，聽其自由結合，又必演爲互相鬥爭。而消滅文化之推進力，中國文化之新體制，必須將此種矛盾對立之職業羣，統合於同一文化統輅體之內，使其自覺，對於推進國家文化之責任，互相理解，放棄個人利益本位之觀念，通力合作。以共同達成對國家所負之最高任務，事變以來，文化機構，文化設備，悉　破壞，文化人材，亦星散四方，現値大東亞戰爭期中，文化資材，來源益覺困難，非依最有效最合理之方法，予以運用，欲於此困難之環境中，投負文化之建設，實小可能，爲使文化運動，循正當軌道，依於國家目的及戰時需要，途其發展，允非首先確立全國文化體制，動員全部文化工作從事者，參加文化建設不可。</p>
<p>第三　實施</p>
<p>（一）充實强化現有關於出版，新聞，著述，廣播，電影，戲劇，美術，音樂，各部門之機構，其有未足以担負事業推進之健全機構者，分別組成協會，採統一主義，俟各協會組織完備之後，組織統一性罩一性之總會，（假定名稱爲中國文化總會）將各種協會，隸屬於總會之下，以謀文化宣傳體制之整備。</p>
<p>（二）調整充實強化現有各種檢查機構，務求機構簡索，事權統一，責任分明，聯系緊密，由有關各機關，派出檢查人員，會同實施圖書，新聞，雜誌，電影，戲劇，唱片，廣播等有關文化宣傳作品，嚴格審查及檢查，採積極指導方針，不僅在消極方面，刪除違反國策之文字，允應在積極方面，指導符合國策之思想。</p>

<p>（四）强化中央電訊社，使能執行其對內對外，唯一全國性質新聞電訊機關之各項特權。</p>
<p>（五）强化中國廣播事業建設協會，嚴厲取締敵性廣播，並謀對外宣傳之積極與强化。</p>
<p>（六）强化電影事業，對製作，發行，及戲院三方面之經營，速謀統籌辦法之實施，以收調節集中之效。</p>
<p>（七）整理報紙，除重要地點外，採一地一報政策，在重要地點有設立一報以上之必要者，亦應分別確立其特質，各遂其發展。</p>
<p>（八）整理雜誌，除地方性質者外，其屬於全國性質者，採一事一刊政策，培養及指導現有之中央導報，使成爲全國務人員必讀之刊物，加深公人員對政府施策及時局動向之認識。</p>
<p>（九）調整強化印刷事業，以便利出版事業之推進。</p>
<p>（十）强化製紙事業，以供應出版事業之需要。</p>
<p>（十一）籌集文化基金，科學獎勵金扶助文化事業之發展及科學智識之普及與深造。（中央社）</p>

<p>（一）聶潞生先生（恒豐紗廠）表示：公的所列各條，已力行十年。無論今日我國人民在水深火熱之中，宴會酬應，均應極端節省，即在承平之時，所用筵席，水陸雜陳，不獨友邦人士遠不能及，即歐美人士亦嘆爲豪奢。一般酒館，有一通病，即全席皆葷，無一素菜，不獨糜費；更不衛生。大家應提倡家庖，不叫館菜，六葷兩素，不用海味，如有百人共同遵守，則風氣可以一變。</p>
<p>（二）丁福保先生意見：减少肉類，多用素菜，若多用肉類及蛋類，則吃下之蛋白笛從腎臟排洩而出，他日可能發腎臟炎致命，余吃素三十餘年，故體力精神皆未衰退。</p>

<h3 id="c42">農村貸款與農村典當 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>農村貸款與農村典當，均爲周轉農村資金之機構，其經營方式，雖或有異，而其性質，實無不同。最近交通銀行等組織農村貸款銀團，實業部飭令各地籌設農村典當等，確爲目前復興農村切要之舉，不勝慶幸。</p>
<p>農村貸款，最好以合作社爲中心·觀察過往情形，有足爲吾人鑑戒參考者數事，謹以貢陳：（一）組織合作社之前，應加宣傳，使農民澈底明瞭合作之意義，庶不致有於款易而收款難之情形發生，以往北方合作社成績較優於南方者，聞即以此原因，（二）愼防爲少數富農及豪紳階級所操縱，以致一般眞正貧農，反無由　益。（三）審察農民用途，務使絕對用於生產，避免濫借妄用。凡此種種，在擬訂辦法時，宜特別注意，以期貫澈貸軟眞義，而收切實效能。</p>
<p>農村典當，組織較爲簡捷，以我國農　向來習慣言，亦比較熟悉而容易推行。同時因有實物抵押，無擔保問題等困難，放款更爲確實可靠。不論公典商典，我們深覺資本必求其足，以樹立農民信仰，利息必求其低，以减輕農民負擔；期限必求其長，以便利農民回贖。凡此均可謂一般原則，務以不離農民福利爲前提，庶合政府飭令設立之本意。</p>
<p>農村貸款與農村典當，均爲目前游資歸宿金融調節最好的方法。我們要藏富於民，使農村復與，國家强盛，這件事，最值得積極偶導和推行。</p>

<p>一又本年上半年決算之期六月底轉瞬即屆，各銀行已決定自本月十五日起開始辦理，對於各往來客戶暫時停止往來，俾便於結算利息，至月底決算竣事後，幷於七月一日二日休假兩日。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Current Chinese Economic Problems <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>To adapt to the economic tasks after joining the war, the National Economic Commission was reorganized in February of this year, directly under the National Government. On February 12th, it held its first plenary session and decided on the outline of wartime economic policies. The commission is about to hold its second plenary session. Before its first plenary session, we sincerely expressed our hope that in the economic field, a wartime economic national policy would be established, not only focusing on the collection and control of materials, but also more actively striving to increase production, rationally increase agricultural production and industrial production, and encourage the production of small and medium-sized industries. We once asserted: "Only by planned and organized promotion of increased production movements, and encouragement of civilian agricultural and industrial production, can the smooth completion of wartime economic policies be guaranteed." Four months have passed, and the current international situation has undergone significant changes, mainly due to the end of the North African war, which means that the world war has moved closer to the stage of the largest-scale decisive battle. In order to win a decisive victory in the decisive battle and ensure the construction of a new world order, it is necessary not only to maximize the combat effectiveness of the Axis powers, but also to maximize the economic strength of all anti-British and American countries. Especially today, when the British and Americans are boasting about opening a second front in Europe, and their situation in the Pacific is still extremely unfavorable, the countries of East Asia should quickly gather all civilian economic forces in the economic sector, prepare to give the enemy a fatal blow, completely eliminate the remaining forces of the enemy in the Pacific, and lay an unshakable foundation for the new order in East Asia. In China, the economic task is to thoroughly complete the "Wartime Economic Policy Outline" and adopt necessary policies to meet the needs of the new situation.</p>
<p>First of all, what we must strengthen is naturally to increase production. However, our focus should not only be on Shanghai and its surrounding areas, but also on the entire Central China, North China, and South China regions, not only on military enterprises, but also on civilian small and medium-sized industries, handicrafts, and even rural sideline industries, and especially on improving agricultural production in various regions. Regarding this aspect, we would like to sincerely express the following points to the National Economic Commission:</p>
<p>1. The encouragement and assistance to industry should be shifted from theoretical policies to facts, especially:</p>
<p>(Two) Industries related to national defense and heavy industry:</p>
<p>(Two) Industries necessary for living should first of all plan practical, universal, and reasonable encouragement and assistance. As for the methods, they are nothing more than:</p>
<p>(One) Ensure that it does not fall into the hands of speculators:</p>
<p>(Two) Or provide necessary subsidies:</p>
<p>(Three) Provide low-interest loans in various ways;</p>
<p>(Four) In terms of supply, assist in collecting necessary raw materials, reduce or eliminate raw material taxes, and reduce raw material transportation costs, and provide various conveniences for transporting raw materials:</p>
<p>(Five) Provide guidance in terms of technology, such as sending technical personnel to inspect and guide, hiring technical personnel from friendly Japan, establishing technical research institutions, and rewarding technical personnel and inventors, etc.:</p>
<p>(Six) Provide necessary power, such as the government supplying cheap electricity:</p>
<p>(Seven) Establish educational and training institutions for labor and technical personnel, organize labor and technical personnel registration and introduction services, improve and protect the lives and health of workers, and organize labor welfare undertakings:</p>
<p>(Eight) Provide convenience and a certain profit in the transportation and sales of products, prevent illegal purchases and hoarding, reduce transportation costs for transportation undertakings, and unify inspection agencies. In addition, attention and assistance must be given to small and medium-sized industries and handicrafts to encourage the general public's enthusiasm for increased production.</p>
<p>Second, it is necessary to strive to encourage and assist agriculture. Our country was originally the largest agricultural country in East Asia. At the same time, from the perspective of national economic life, agricultural economy is actually the main form of national economy in our country today. However, in recent years, it is undeniable that due to the impact of the war, my country's rural economy is not only in dire straits, but also on the verge of collapse. Therefore, the production of agricultural products is actually decreasing year by year. In addition, in some areas, there have been years of drought, land abandonment, and displacement of farmers, turning tens of thousands of producers into wandering elements. If appropriate countermeasures are not taken quickly, then it will not only be impossible to provide our agricultural raw materials to cooperate in the war, and to provide our rural economic strength to cooperate in the construction of the co-prosperity sphere, but even to maintain the national economy, and even to merely maintain the national agricultural economy to barely survive, I am afraid it will be very difficult. To this end, we sincerely hope that the National Economic Commission's second congress will, in the future, set comprehensive policies on how to protect the farmers' economy, improve farmers' lives, and encourage and assist agricultural production, and cooperate with the government to seek their implementation. We believe that the most important thing is:</p>
<p>(One) Promote agricultural loans, and ensure that they truly enter the hands of productive farmers. On the one hand, prevent local tyrants and evil gentry from using their positions to borrow large amounts of funds to lend at high interest rates. On the other hand, prevent farmers from using the borrowed funds to pay rent, repay debts, and pay interest. It is necessary to establish reasonable credit cooperation, relax the conditions for deductions and guarantees, so that loans can enter the hands of actual productive farmers, and reduce interest rates, lighten their burden, and increase their enthusiasm for production. Now, the Bank of Communications has been ordered to conduct rural surveys in preparation for running agricultural enterprises. This prudent and serious attitude is commendable. However, the strength of one bank may not be universal, and we hope that it can be extended to areas outside Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>(Two) Strictly control the activities of speculative capital in rural areas, and guide it to truly assist in increasing production. If "speculative capital goes to the countryside" not to promote agricultural production, but to buy land, then the result will be the transfer of land rights. Land will be transferred from the hands of productive farmers and small landlords to the hands of owners of speculative capital residing in large cities such as Shanghai. The result of land right concentration is the emergence of new large landlords and a sharp reduction in the number of self-cultivating farmers and small landlords. This phenomenon is a great crisis for the national economy, and the government should quickly find ways to protect the tenancy rights of tenant farmers, prevent the concentration of land rights, and speculative actions on land rights, so that farmers can maintain their land and increase production with peace of mind.</p>
<p>(Three) Promote rural education, farmers' literacy campaigns, and the large-scale cultivation of agricultural technical talents, and introduce new agricultural technologies, production methods, and new agricultural production tools from friendly Japan to improve our country's agricultural production and increase its production capacity.</p>
<p>(Four) Promote the rural marketing cooperation business to avoid the exploitation of commercial capital. At the same time, the procurement methods of agricultural products must be improved, especially the policy of low prices for agricultural products must be changed, and the prices of agricultural products should be increased to a reasonable level as much as possible (increase direct purchase prices and suppress the sales prices of agricultural product merchants). Only in this way can the enthusiasm of farmers to increase production be encouraged and the goal of increasing materials can be achieved.</p>
<p>Third, improving the people's economic life is currently as important as increasing production, and it is a more fundamental issue. The difficulty of the people's lives is already an undeniable fact; at a time when everyone cannot maintain their minimum living standards, it is difficult to achieve practical results by concentrating national human, material, and financial resources to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War and the construction of a new order. As for the greatest difficulties currently facing the people, one is the seriousness of the price problem, and the other is the repeated occurrence of disasters in various places. To this end, we believe that the National Economic Commission's conference should establish an overall plan to improve people's livelihoods, and strive to stabilize the value of the legal currency, increase the production of materials, facilitate transportation, guide the national psychology, and expand the famine relief movement. The droughts in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi have not yet been completely eliminated, and the disaster situation in the Chaoshan area of South China has occurred again. This serious drought, on the one hand, causes a large number of disaster victims to be displaced and die, and on the other hand, it is manifested as the stagnation of industrial and agricultural production in the vast disaster areas, and the consumption of materials and financial resources in non-disaster areas. Therefore, unreasonable economic and political phenomena, coupled with natural disasters, have created a major disaster. At the same time, major disasters can also cause political, social, and economic crises. The current famine relief movement has positive significance. If it is done well, it can win over the hearts of the people under the Communist regime, so as to create a comprehensive peace. If it is done well, it can stimulate people's hearts, increase production, enrich materials, and lay the foundation for future construction. We hope that the authorities will proceed with the greatest determination and spare no funds to carry out active and constructive disaster relief, not only to ensure that the funds donated by the people in various places will completely and effectively enter the hands of the disaster victims, as funds to maintain their lives, relieve the sick, but also to restore farmland, reclaim wasteland, build canals, improve transportation, and increase production, so that not a single penny is wasted, and not a single penny does not achieve its due effect. We firmly believe that as long as the people's lives are improved, all national policies can be guaranteed to be implemented thoroughly. We hope that the National Economic Commission's second plenary session will be more successful than the first one, and we hope that the government will, with the greatest determination and effort, ensure that the resolutions of the National Economic Commission are implemented quickly and thoroughly.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy Minister of Propaganda Explains Objectives Popularizing Wartime Awareness Mobilizing Cultural Total Power Hopes Fourth Warrior Will Take on the Responsibility of Implementation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) Yesterday morning at 10:30, Minister of Propaganda Lin met with Chinese and foreign reporters to announce the "Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy" passed by the Supreme National Defense Council the day before. He first pointed out that the biggest goal of this outline is to popularize wartime awareness, concentrate forces, and complete the Greater East Asia War. He also gave a brief explanation of the relationship between Article 10 of the National Government's Program, Article 2 of the Basic Treaty between China and Japan, the Four Great Principles of the East Asia Alliance, and the Outline of the New National Movement, and this outline. Minister Lin also said that completing the Asia War is the most important task at present, and spiritual and material forces must be carried out simultaneously. If material forces are not enough, spiritual forces are even more important. It is necessary to exert spiritual forces to enhance material forces. When discussing the content of this outline, Minister Lin pointed out that in one aspect, it is to clear up the toxic ideologies of Britain, the United States, and communism. In the positive aspect, it is to rebuild the culture of China and East Asia. As early as the ninth year of the Republic of China, Chairman Wang pointed out the trend of Chinese thought in his article "The Dissolution of Two Models of Psychology." This trend of thought is now being concretely realized in the Greater East Asia War. Minister Lin also said that the peace movement is not only a diplomatic work, but also an ideological movement with practicality. The Greater East Asia War is not only a military war, but also a mental war. The purpose of war is not destruction, but construction. The "Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy" is based on this, and finally said that after the National Government promulgated this outline, it hopes that the comrades in the Fourth Warrior who are responsible for propaganda and reporting will, in accordance with this outline, step up propaganda, and especially set an example and strive to implement it. The comrades in the Fourth Warrior are actually the first responsible persons for implementing this outline. They must take the lead in practicing and promoting it to others. He sincerely hopes that friendly countries will provide cooperation in cultural propaganda.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) Regarding the basic outline of the wartime cultural propaganda policy, the Supreme National Defense Council recently passed it and sent it to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. The wartime cultural propaganda policy guidelines have detailed explanations, that is, to mobilize the total power of cultural propaganda, and undertake the task of cultural and ideological warfare in the Greater East Asia War, and do its best with friendly Japan and other East Asian countries to promote the completion of the Greater East Asia War on the one hand, and strive to rebuild and develop Chinese culture, and integrate and create East Asian culture on the other hand, and contribute to the world culture of the new order. The main points are divided into seven points, divided into seven parts. The most important thing is to recognize that the completion of the Greater East Asia War is the prerequisite for the realization of all East Asian ideals, and that national groupism is the criterion for the construction of the new order in East Asia. In order to realize the above two major goals, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and its focus, Pan-Asianism, are the highest guiding principles for the restoration of China and the protection of East Asia. Second, expose the evils of Anglo-Americanism, because for a hundred years, Britain and the United States have done their best to anesthetize people ideologically, in addition to various economic, military, and political aggressions against China and even East Asia. In the past 100 years, most people have a humble mentality of relying on Britain and the United States. If this mentality is not eliminated one day, it will be an obstacle to the construction of the new order in East Asia. Therefore, exposing the evils of Anglo-Americanism is listed as the second point. Secondly, since the incident, people's hearts have been decadent and languishing. Therefore, the fourth point should be based on the outline of the New National Movement, to eliminate this decadence and all kinds of hedonistic mentality. Also, China originally had a very profound culture, but in recent years, it has worshiped foreign cultures and ignored our country's inherent culture. Therefore, the fifth point is to revitalize the national culture, absorb foreign cultures, and correct the erroneous ideas of blindly restoring the old and worshiping the foreign while rejecting the domestic, in order to strengthen the foundation of Chinese culture. In view of the fact that in recent years, there have been various reasons for its weakness, but the backwardness of science is the biggest reason. The sixth point is to pay special attention to the scientific education of young people and seek technical training. Furthermore, since our country's culture has always been very scattered, its guiding principle is to concentrate and cultivate talents. The seventh point is to concentrate cultural talents, unite cultural forces, adjust cultural undertakings, and establish a total system of cultural propaganda, in order to mobilize all cultural workers to engage in the construction of organized cultural work. The implementation part is divided into ten parts, which have been decided to be announced tomorrow. The implementation of this wartime cultural propaganda policy is closely related to the construction of our country's culture, East Asian culture, and the East Asian new order. Therefore, cultural workers from now on should not only use this as a standard, but our people should also follow this policy and practice it, so that they can achieve the mission of revitalizing China and protecting East Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Army Counterattacks Yidu Chongqing Army <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) In this summer offensive operation, the Central China Expeditionary Force annihilated 17 divisions of the Chongqing 6th War Zone Army. When the operational objectives were achieved and they wanted to return to their original defenses, the elite troops of the 79th Army Commander Xia Chuzhong, a direct descendant of Chongqing, suddenly mobilized and advanced to the front of Yidu, taking a posture of pursuit. After the Japanese army realized this, they immediately counterattacked. Before the battle could last long, the Chongqing army collapsed. In this battle, the 98th Division of Xia Chuzhong's unit had advanced to about eight kilometers south of Yidu this month. The Japanese army mobilized at dawn on the 5th, and occupied Muqi Mountain (eleven kilometers south of Yidu) at noon of the same day, and fiercely attacked the steep mountains of the Bashan mountain range. The Chongqing army was defeated on the 6th. At the same time, a certain unit of the Japanese army, which started attacking from a certain direction in response to this, also surrounded and defeated the Chongqing 194th Division near Zhijiang, and then urgently pursued the Chongqing Temporary 6th Division to near Shijiahe, and still crushed it.</p>
<p>Jinan, 11th (Central News Agency) The Chongqing forces in North China are on the verge of collapse due to repeated attacks by the Japanese army. The comprehensive battle results achieved by the Japanese army in the northern and southern areas of the Yellow River in the provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan in May are as follows: (The numbers in parentheses are for the Communist army) Number of engagements: 390 (200 times); Chongqing army's engaged forces: 93,403 (257,755); Chongqing army's corpses abandoned: 125,333 (1,016); Prisoners captured: 6,022 (261); Destroyed Chongqing and Communist army facilities: 7; Japanese army captured 7 mortars, 8 heavy machine guns, 104 light machine guns, 5,776 rifles, 203 pistols, 13 automatic rifles, 2 flat-trajectory guns, 18 grenade launchers, 77 foreign guns, 636 hand grenades, 78,581 rounds of rifle bullets, and various other ammunition.</p>
<p>Taiyuan, 11th (Central News Agency) The comprehensive battle results of the Japanese army against the Chongqing and Communist armies in Shanxi Province in May are as follows: (Today and yesterday's Taihang Mountain operations) Number of engagements: 293; Chongqing army's engaged forces: 33,131; Chongqing army's corpses abandoned: 1,601; Prisoners captured: 451; Surrendered: 17; Destroyed Chongqing army facilities: 1; Japanese army captured 18 light machine guns, 64 grenades, 28 rifles, 8 automatic rifles, 3,737 pistols, 57 hand grenades, and other military supplies.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Weekly War Situation of Japanese Army Stationed in China <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) The press department of the Japanese Expeditionary Army stationed in China announced the weekly war situation on the 11th, saying that recently, whenever the war is over, the Chongqing planes immediately mobilize, thinking that it is the so-called first summer offensive. The Chongqing planes also mobilized, and the US air force stationed in Chongqing also cooperated with the Chongqing air force to carry out guerrilla warfare. However, from this kind of joint operation, it can be seen that the US intention is obviously to make the Chongqing air force under the command of the US air force. Also, because they always carry out guerrilla warfare and dare not confront the Japanese air force, it is sufficient to prove that the Japanese army has secured air superiority. The Chongqing side cannot cope with the Japanese planes with ground troops. It is expected that the entire powerful air force will be mobilized urgently. Therefore, the Japanese land air force preemptively bombed Liangshan on the 6th, destroying more than 20 Chongqing planes. On the same day, it also attacked Enshi and shot down a Chongqing plane. On the 9th, it attacked Jian'ou and destroyed various facilities at the airport there, thereby seizing air superiority. Also on the 6th, Rong Ziheng, the commander-in-chief of the Southern Shandong General Headquarters of the Chongqing (Shandong-Jiangsu War Zone), led 20,000 troops to participate in the peace movement. The 112th Division and the 114th Division led by General Rong were all old Northeast Army. Since the Manchurian Incident, they have been engaged in the Anti-Japanese War for twelve years. Now that they have participated in the peace movement, it has a profound and significant impact on the anti-Japanese psychology of the old Northeast Army. Since the National Government joined the war, the Chongqing army generals in North China who have returned include General Wu Huawen, Li Yongping, Li Wenli, Pang Bingxun, and Sun Dianying. This is sufficient to prove the low anti-Japanese will of the Chongqing army and the increasing political power of the National Government.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japanese Army Press Officer Colonel Iwasaki Promoted to Important Position Delivers Speech Lieutenant Colonel Sanpin Succeeds as Press Officer <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) Colonel Iwasaki Harushige, the army press officer of the Japanese Expeditionary Army stationed in China, has been ordered to be promoted to a certain important position, and his vacancy was announced on the 10th to be succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel Takashi Sanpin.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) Colonel Iwasaki, the army press officer of the Japanese Expeditionary Army stationed in China, was recently ordered to be promoted to a certain important position. Before taking office, he met with reporters yesterday, the 11th, and delivered a farewell speech, the gist of which is as follows: I have been ordered to come to China for more than four years and three months, and I have been the press officer for two and a half years. This time I leave, I really have infinite feelings. During my tenure as press officer, I did my best from the standpoint of ideological warfare against the Chongqing authorities in order to seek the awakening of Chongqing. Unfortunately, the Chongqing regime still holds its prejudices and is willing to be used by Britain and the United States to continue the war of resistance. Thinking for East Asia and planning for China are all great regrets. During my tenure, the Greater East Asia War broke out and the National Government joined the war. This is a historic new situation, especially a time of trouble. Now the National Government is developing step by step, the organization is becoming more and more sound, and it is gradually moving towards the road of revitalization. I am sincerely happy. In particular, the progress of Japan's policy towards China and the strengthening of the National Government's power are all infinitely gratifying to us for the future of Greater East Asia and the future of China. In the future, I will still pray for the continuous development of China, which is my sincere hope. During my tenure, I have been blessed with understanding and cooperation from both China and Japan, and I have been able to complete my mission without fault. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone here.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Rong Zhen Delivers Speech <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Beijing, 11th (Central News Agency) Rong Zhen, the new member of the Military Affairs Committee of the National Government, was formerly the chief of staff of the Northeast Army and a leading figure in the Northeast Army. On the 6th of this month, Rong Ziheng, the commander of the Shandong-Jiangsu War Zone, and his son participated in the peace camp. Now the father and son are jointly participating in peace and are determined to stand up and work hard for the construction of a new China. Rong recently expressed his feelings on the evolution since the Manchurian Incident, saying: At the time of the September 18th Incident, I was the chief of staff of the Northeast Border Defense Army. I and the Japanese army had a considerable understanding of each other, but because of the lack of a way to resolve misunderstandings, I had to leave Manchuria. After the July 7th Incident, I did not ask about world affairs and closed the door to read. For six years, my son Ziheng has been rushing about to resist Japan and save the country. Now he has thoroughly realized that there is no way to save China without peace, and he resolutely joined the peace camp. Therefore, I also decided to work hard with Ziheng for the construction of a new China. It is said that Zhang Xueming has also been appointed as a member of the Military Affairs Committee at the same time. Xueming and Ziheng were classmates and close friends when they studied in Japan. Therefore, I am very pleased that the two of them are jointly participating in the National Government. Xueming is the eighth younger brother of Zhang Xueliang. Therefore, his participation in the peace camp has a great impact on the old Northeast Army generals in Chongqing. Many of the key figures in the Manchurian government are my friends, so I often hear about the development of Manchuria. I was not born in Manchuria, but I would like to see its rapid progress in the past twelve years.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Wang Yitang Returns to Beijing <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Beijing, 11th (Central News Agency) Wang Yitang, the current member of the National Government and the former chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, also visited Japan for a month. He recently finished his affairs and returned to this place by car at 11:00 am on the 11th.</p>
<p>Beijing, 11th (Central News Agency) Wang Yitang, the member of the National Government and former chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, visited Japan on May 11 to thank the Japanese government and the public, and returned to this place on the 11th. According to Wang's talk about his impressions of visiting Japan, he said: I was honored to be received by His Majesty the Emperor during this visit to Japan. I was also warmly received by the Japanese government and the public, and I had the opportunity to exchange views with friendly officials such as Prime Minister Tojo. In addition to my gratitude, I am determined to do my best to promote friendly relations between the two countries. During this visit to Japan, I saw that the Japanese people are all working hard in their respective positions, which is really admirable. For example, women in Tokyo, Osaka and other places are all wearing work clothes, fully demonstrating their determination to deal with any situation at any time.

<h3 id="e8">YU AUTHORITIES DEMAND ZHU AND MAO CEASE MILITARY ACTIONS <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to reliable sources, after holding a meeting of the CCP leadership in Yan'an recently, the CCP ordered the main force of Lin Biao's army and part of He Long's army to move from the front line to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region and begin large-scale military alert operations. He Yingqin, "Chief of the General Staff of the Military Council" of the Yu faction, and Bai Chongxi, "Deputy Chief of the General Staff," jointly telegraphed Zhu De and Mao Zedong on the 8th of this month, questioning the reasons for the CCP Central Committee's arbitrary movement of troops, and demanding that the CCP immediately cease confrontational military actions near the border region. However, the movement of CCP troops has not stopped due to interference from the Yu faction and has continued in recent days. It is reported that the Yu faction is currently holding operational review meetings in Lanzhou, Xi'an, and Luoyang simultaneously, based on instructions from the Yu "Military Council," and is currently discussing specific alert measures against the CCP army. Furthermore, the Yu political circles attach great importance to the development of this situation, believing that the CCP will adopt what kind of attitude towards the Yu Central Authorities' demands, or whether it will make the problem more complicated.</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Recently, the conflict between the Yu and the Communists has intensified again. The Zhasake Banner security team on the south bank of the Yellow River, belonging to the Mengjiang Yi League, incited by the Communist Party, launched a riot on March 25th. As a result, the conflict between the Yu and the Communists in the northern Shaanxi area has spread widely, and its evolution is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3 id="e9">YU AUTHORITIES CONVENE SECOND NATIONAL PRODUCTION CONFERENCE <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Chongqing telegram, the second national production conference of the Yu faction, which began in Chongqing on the 1st of this month, closed on the 9th. This conference focused on solving problems such as material shortages and rising prices by increasing production. Due to the significant divergence of opinions in the conference, it sufficiently reflected the current economic distress of the Yu faction. The conference was originally scheduled for one week, but it seemed to be extended by two days out of necessity. Chiang Kai-shek also attended every day and emphasized the importance of increasing production at the opening, saying: "To seek the industrialization of China is the primary goal of this increase in production." Therefore, general discussions also focused on industrial aspects. The first national production conference in the 27th year of the Xingguo era focused on agricultural production. This conference, on the other hand, focused on industry, which is sufficient evidence of the Yu faction's economic difficulties and the general shortage of materials.</p>

Both armies are currently planning to launch large-scale operations under favorable conditions. This is sufficient to imply that the timing of the battle is gradually maturing.

Regarding education policy, it will also be based on thoroughly implementing the Argentine education policy and investigating domestic universities and other schools. The new government's attitude towards domestic administrative parties seems to be quite cold, which is particularly noteworthy. After the lifting of martial law on the 8th, the guard soldiers at government offices in the capital of Argentina were also removed, and the city has returned to normal. However, the parliament is still closed, prohibiting members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives from entering, so it can be seen that the new government is quite averse to political parties.</p>

<p>Rome, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Stefani News Agency announced last night: The Italian Prime Minister received the German Ambassador, Mai Gengshen, yesterday, and the conversation was very sincere. They also reiterated the close unity between the two countries and their determination to continue fighting until the final victory is achieved.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (German News Agency dispatch) - The German News Agency reported that yesterday was the third anniversary of Italy's entry into the war. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop separately received the Italian Ambassador, Alfieri, and the meeting was very cordial. He also reiterated the close unity of the three allied countries and their determination to fight until the final victory.</p>
<p>Rome, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Gaida, the editor-in-chief of "Italian Daily," wrote an article severely criticizing the enemy's propaganda attempting to alienate Germany and Italy. The enemy's propaganda claims: Italy is an obstacle that Germany itself wants to remove, and at the same time claims: Germany is a serious danger to Italy. Gaida said: Germany and Italy know full well that they must cooperate with each other in the Mediterranean. Italy is determined to do everything in its power to resist the enemy and relies on its armed forces to contribute to the decisive battle for the final victory.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The recent propaganda from the anti-Axis countries that they will establish a second front in Europe and are actively planning empty attacks has not only not been believed by European countries, but has also not had any effect on the countries of West and Central Asia, such as Turkey, Iran, and India. On the contrary, it is believed that this propaganda is sufficient to prove the weakness of the anti-Axis forces. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Indian Freedom Post said: Britain and the United States have recently frequently promoted an attack on the European continent, but this move is by no means easy. The anti-Axis forces' success in North Africa was due to surprise attacks and the fact that the anti-Axis countries had secretly scouted and prepared in advance in France and Algiers. Conversely, landing in Europe cannot gain the advantage of surprise and must rely on the walls and fortresses built by the German army and the counterattack of the German air force. Therefore, if they dare to launch a landing operation, they will lose a large number of soldiers and huge ships. Therefore, what Britain and the United States can hope for is, at most, to use propaganda warfare to contain a part of the military force deployed on the European coast. If Britain and the United States are unable to break through the strong resistance of the German army, then the landing operation will not succeed. Therefore, the two countries can only strengthen bombing from now on. Furthermore, the Bombay News reported: "Churchill approved a large-scale air raid plan, which may be the entire war plan of the anti-Axis countries for this year."</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Huitong News Agency reports that although the losses of anti-Axis ships have decreased in the past two months, naval experts in London believe that the submarine threat has not yet been overcome. According to Arihanda's correspondent in London, British naval experts said that the reduction in losses of anti-Axis ships in the past two months is not due to improvements in defensive measures, but because Germany has withdrawn its submarines in the Atlantic Ocean so that they can be concentrated in the territorial waters off the coast of Europe in case the anti-Axis countries invade. British naval figures pointed out that the concentration of German submarines to attack the anti-Axis invasion fleet may result in the loss of many transport ships and admitted that the anti-Axis military action to invade Europe will be extremely difficult and will inevitably suffer significant losses.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Basic Guidelines for Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy Promulgated by the Republic of China on June 10th of the 12th Year <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>First, Guiding Principles</p>
<p>The basic guiding principle of the wartime cultural propaganda policy of the National Government is to mobilize all cultural propaganda resources, undertake the tasks of cultural and ideological warfare in the Greater East Asia War, and cooperate with friendly Japan and other East Asian countries to the best of our abilities.  The aim is to both expedite the completion of the Greater East Asia War and vigorously seek the reconstruction and development of Chinese culture, as well as the integration and creation of East Asian culture, and further contribute to the world culture of the New Order.  To thoroughly implement the above basic guiding principle, it is first necessary to stimulate a national consensus on wartime consciousness, and, based on national conditions and adapting to wartime needs, engage in the establishment of systems, the concentration of power, the clarification of thought, the correction of concepts, and the development of science and technology.</p>
<p>Second, Key Points</p>
<p>(1)  Recognizing that the completion of the Greater East Asia War is the prerequisite for the realization of all East Asian ideals, that national collectivism is the guiding principle for the construction of a New Order in East Asia, and that Chinese culture is a link in East Asian culture, we should grasp the essence of Sino-Japanese culture, promote East Asian culture, consolidate the East Asian axis, and fulfill the mission of the war.</p>
<p>(Main Points) 1.  The teachings of the Founding Father, the Three Principles of the People, and their emphasis on Pan-Asianism, are the highest guiding principles for the revival of China and the defense of East Asia. The leader's pronouncements are elucidations and developments of the Founding Father's teachings. This understanding should be universally disseminated, and international communism and other distorted and misunderstood incorrect concepts should be corrected.</p>
<p>2.  China and Japan share life and death; China and Japan coexist and prosper in East Asia. Their shared destiny has an inherent relationship that cannot be severed. This understanding should be universally disseminated, and the incorrect concepts of inciting and slandering by Britain, the United States, and the Chongqing Communists should be corrected.</p>
<p>3.  The four major principles of the East Asian League—political independence, economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural exchange—are pure concepts for uniting the East Asian nations and guaranteeing peace in East Asia. This understanding should be universally disseminated, and the incorrect concepts spread by Britain, the United States, and others attempting to sabotage this should be corrected.</p>
<p>4.  China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, and its joint effort with friendly Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War, have a sure prospect of victory, whether militarily or economically.  The people should thoroughly recognize the significance of the National Government's participation in the war and cooperation with friendly nations, and encourage the spirit and effort of the people's total participation in the war.</p>
<p>(Explanation) The Greater East Asia War is not only a war of force, but also a war of spirit. The purpose of this war is not destruction, but construction. At this dawn of Asia, the achievements of the struggles of the East Asian nations and peoples, the expression of their wills, and the development of their creative abilities should have the necessity and possibility of exchange, integration, and joint effort. China, in its vow to share life and death with friendly Japan, should exert its utmost efforts in ideological struggle and cultural construction, and contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>(2)  Liquidate the evils of Anglo-American imperialism, eliminate the poisonous ideology of Anglo-American individual liberalism, eradicate the abject mentality of dependence on Britain and the United States, and raise the national sentiment of defeating Anglo-American imperialism.</p>
<p>(Main Points) 1.  Expose the history of Anglo-American domination of the world, division of East Asia, aggression against China, aggression against India, aggression against Southeast Asia, and aggression against the Philippines, and arouse the people's anti-Anglo-American sentiment.</p>
<p>2.  Realize co-existence and eliminate aggression.</p>
<p>3.  Promote the spirit of morality and eliminate utilitarian thinking.</p>
<p>4.  Realize collectivism and eliminate individual liberalism.</p>
<p>5.  Realize democratic centralism and overthrow false democracy.</p>
<p>(Explanation) For the past hundred years, Anglo-American aggression against China and East Asia has not only been military and economic.  In culture, they have exhausted their ability to ideologically anesthetize us.  This kind of poisoning must be clarified, and a firm belief in defeating Britain and the United States must be established.</p>
<p>(3)  Prevent the disruption of international communism, eliminate the poisonous ideology of class struggle, and promote China's inherent ethnic ethical concepts.</p>
<p>(Main Points) 1.  Expose the conspiracies of communism to disrupt society and incite war.</p>
<p>2.  Promote the spirit of cooperation, eliminate the agitation of class struggle, and incite human hatred.</p>
<p>3.  Promote constructive and guiding culture, and eradicate destructive and exposing culture.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, peace, and harmony are the spirit of China's founding and the foundation of ethnic ethics. Cooperative survival is the driving force of social evolution, and class struggle is a social pathology. The cultural policy of the Communist Party is dedicated to exposing the dark side of society in extreme detail, in order to incite human hatred, destroy national self-confidence, and carry out its conspiracies to incite social unrest and harm the country. At this critical moment of national survival, it is imperative to eliminate the Communist Party's concept of social conflict and, based on the spirit of China's founding, promote ethnic ethical concepts in order to achieve social development, cultural advancement, and the overall development of the nation.</p>
<p>(4)  Cultivate a diligent, positive, and upward self-disciplined outlook on life, eradicate the decadent, degenerate, nihilistic, and permissive habits of the decadent, and, with a practical sense of responsibility, cooperate in the completion of the wartime system and enhance the country's overall combat power.</p>
<p>(Main Points) 1.  The purpose of life is service, and all past bad habits of competing for wealth should be corrected.</p>
<p>2.  Diligence is the source of increasing the people's power and enriching the country's power. All past bad habits of enjoying ease and comfort should be corrected.</p>
<p>3.  Individuals cannot exist independently of the nation. All past bad attitudes of permissiveness, idle talk, onlookers, and indifference should be corrected.</p>
<p>4.  Adultery, theft, and ethical misfortunes are social crimes. Past descriptions that catered to such things are nothing less than encouraging social crimes and greatly damaging the country's vitality, and should be corrected.</p>
<p>5.  Responsibility, emphasis on practice, courageous and vigorous progress, and hard work and endurance are the only principles of action for wartime citizens. The exertion of the country's total power and the improvement of the people's lives all depend on this, and should be advocated to overcome decadence.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Enjoyment, decadence, nihilism, and permissiveness are decadent social habits. Added to this is the invasion of so-called Western material civilization, and the malicious exposure of the Communist Party's cultural policies. The social status quo reflects the formation of a bad ideological form on culture, and the bad ideological form on culture affects the further deterioration of the social status quo. The heart of clinging to life in a cowardly manner arises from this; the thought of contention and greed arises from this; the behavior of adultery and theft arises from this. These habits should be eradicated in accordance with the New Life Movement Outline.</p>
<p>(5)  Integrate the common will of the nation, unleash the creative ability of the whole, revive the inherent culture, absorb foreign culture, and correct the erroneous thinking of blindly restoring the past, blindly worshiping foreign things, and rejecting foreign things, in order to strengthen the foundation of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>(Main Points) 1.  Establish a collectivist culture and correct the erroneous concepts of liberalism.</p>
<p>2.  Establish the public character of cultural undertakings and eliminate the concepts of private ownership and purely profit-making.</p>
<p>3.  Do not forget our roots, do not be rigidly attached to the past.</p>
<p>4.  Replace possessive and complacent culture with creative and progressive culture.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Culture is the result of the nation's struggle, the repository of the nation's will, and the highest expression of the nation's creative ability. The creation of literature and art, scientific research, the creation of careers, the reconstruction and development of culture should aim at inheriting this result, realizing this will, and developing this creative ability. Chinese culture has its inherent value. The nation's morality, national belief, and national spirit are all entrusted to it. Forgetting one's ancestors is the greatest shame of the nation. However, social sciences evolve with the development of human culture, and human culture develops due to exchange and integration. Therefore, reviving the inherent culture, promoting its strengths and correcting its shortcomings, absorbing foreign culture, extracting its essence and cleansing its toxicity, is an urgent task for the revitalization and development of Chinese culture, and the integration and creation of Greater East Asian culture.</p>
<p>(6)  Popularize scientific education, support scientific research, improve science and technology, and encourage scientific inventions.</p>
<p>(Main Points) 1.  With the aim of developing China's industry and cooperating in the successful construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and leading China to become a strong and important component of it, support scientific research, improve science and technology, and encourage scientific inventions.</p>
<p>2.  With the guiding principle of establishing a total scientific and technological force, concentrate and cultivate scientific talents and mobilize and enhance technical capabilities under a unified national plan.</p>
<p>3.  Eliminate mystical and absurd concepts, popularize scientific knowledge, promote the scientific spirit, and pay special attention to scientific education and technical training for young people.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Modern scientific civilization is a collection of the contributions of all mankind and should be commonly owned by the world. China has made great contributions to the creation and development of world culture, and should continue to have effective use and promotion in the future. In recent years, although scientific knowledge has been generally recognized by the Chinese people, the concepts of mysticism and absurdity have not been eliminated, and the popularization of scientific knowledge is slow. Science and technology cannot be improved. In order to complete the wartime system and the foundation of cultural construction, science and technology must be the center of the reconstruction and development of Chinese culture, so as to revitalize the national scientific spirit and seek the epoch-making development of science and the leap-forward improvement of technology.</p>
<p>(7)  Concentrate cultural talents, unite cultural forces, adjust cultural undertakings, and establish a total system of cultural propaganda.</p>
<p>(Main Points) 1.  All cultural manpower, material resources, and various business institutions should be reasonably adjusted and allocated, and integrated under the sole comprehensive organization of the whole group, so as to make concerted efforts and planned development.</p>
<p>2.  This institution is a joint organization of the government and the people, which on the one hand assists the government in promoting national policies, and on the other hand unifies public opinion, communicates popular sentiment, and eliminates the past erroneous concept of opposition between the government and the people.</p>
<p>3.  This institution integrates various cultural undertakings and their practitioners, stipulates their due responsibilities, and grants them legitimate rights and guarantees to eliminate the accumulated malpractices of scattered organizations, divergent opinions, and conflicting interests in the past.</p>
<p>4.  This institution and its affiliated undertakings are recognized as national public undertakings, not a combination of personal management and profit.</p>
<p>(Explanation) China's cultural organizations have always been extremely scattered. The rise and fall of cultural trends and the rise and fall of cultural undertakings are subject to the freedom of the cultural world. Although the state has stipulated the guiding principles for culture, it still lacks systematic planning for the promotion of cultural happiness, so that cultural thoughts are chaotic and chaotic. The culture of communism, the culture of international aggression, the backward thinking of restoring the old, and even the works of obscenity and piracy are circulated and recited repeatedly, which has deeply harmed the national thinking. The reason is that the free and permissive doctrine is to blame. The cultural circles are poisoned by individual liberalism, mistakenly believing that the expression of thought can be subject to individual freedom, and the sale of cultural works is only for the purpose of profit. It does not feel any joint responsibility for how it will affect the people. This is a mistake in cultural thinking, and the national cultural system has not yet been established. It can neither provide strict supervision for cultural undertakings and cultural work, nor can it provide effective guarantees. It has allowed them to seek their own affairs, which is the reason why. As for cultural organizations, they are often duplicated and duplicated due to the toxicity of individual liberalism and capitalist profit-making. There are countless small groups, small institutions, and small enterprises of the same nature, competing with each other and destroying each other, so that useful materials are mutually offset to uselessness. Not only is it a loss of personal capital and financial resources, but also a loss of the country's total cultural power. In the cultural industry, there are entrepreneurs engaged in management, cultural people engaged in mental strength, and workers engaged in labor. If these three aspects are not integrated with the highest guiding principles, and they are allowed to combine freely, they will inevitably evolve into mutual struggle and eliminate the driving force of cultural promotion. The new system of Chinese culture must integrate this contradictory and opposing occupational group into the same cultural unified system, so that it can consciously understand the responsibility for promoting national culture, understand each other, abandon the concept of individual interest-basedness, and cooperate to achieve the highest mission entrusted to the country. Since the incident, cultural institutions and cultural facilities have been destroyed, and cultural talents have also been scattered in all directions. Currently, during the Greater East Asia War, the source of cultural materials is even more difficult. It is impossible to invest in cultural construction in this difficult environment if it is not operated in the most effective and rational way. In order to make the cultural movement follow the right track and develop according to the national purpose and wartime needs, it is necessary to first establish a national cultural system and mobilize all cultural workers to participate in cultural construction.</p>
<p>Third, Implementation</p>
<p>(1)  Enrich and strengthen the existing institutions in publishing, news, writing, broadcasting, film, drama, art, music, and other departments. Those that are not sufficient to undertake the sound institutions for the promotion of business shall be formed into associations separately, adopting a unified doctrine. After the associations are fully organized, a unified general assembly (hypothetically named the Chinese Cultural General Assembly) shall be organized, and the associations shall be subordinated to the general assembly to plan for the establishment of a cultural propaganda system.</p>
<p>(2)  Adjust, enrich, and strengthen the existing various inspection agencies, and strive for simple institutions, unified powers, clear responsibilities, and close ties. The relevant agencies shall send inspectors to jointly implement strict censorship and inspection of cultural propaganda works such as books, newspapers, magazines, movies, dramas, records, and radio. A positive guiding principle shall be adopted, not only in the negative aspect, to delete texts that violate national policies, but also in the positive aspect, to guide thoughts that conform to national policies.</p>
<p>(3)  Implement the registration and inspection of publications of various countries in China, and severely crack down on enemy news and communications, in order to unify the propaganda power.</p>
<p>(4)  Strengthen the Central News Agency, so that it can exercise its various privileges as the only national news and communications agency for both domestic and foreign affairs.</p>
<p>(5)  Strengthen the China Broadcasting Corporation Construction Association, severely crack down on enemy broadcasting, and seek the active and strengthened foreign propaganda.</p>
<p>(6)  Strengthen the film industry, and quickly seek the implementation of overall planning methods for production, distribution, and theater operations to achieve the effect of regulation and concentration.</p>
<p>(7)  Consolidate newspapers, and adopt a one-newspaper policy in each place except for important locations. Where it is necessary to establish more than one newspaper in important locations, their characteristics should also be established separately, and each should be allowed to develop.</p>
<p>(8)  Consolidate magazines, and adopt a one-publication policy for each subject, except for local ones. Cultivate and guide the existing central guide, so that it can become a must-read publication for national affairs personnel, and deepen the public's understanding of government policies and current events.</p>
<p>(9)  Adjust and strengthen the printing industry to facilitate the promotion of the publishing industry.</p>
<p>(10) Strengthen the paper making industry to meet the needs of the publishing industry.</p>
<p>(11) Raise cultural funds and scientific incentive funds to support the development of cultural undertakings and the popularization and in-depth study of scientific knowledge. (Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Reorganization of Financial Institutions Stipulates Bank Capital of at Least Three Million Insufficient Capital Will Be Increased or Merged Unauthorized Banks and Pawnshops Must Register by Deadline <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is currently studying various countermeasures to reorganize financial institutions and promote the effective implementation of financial controls. Close consideration is being given to the reorganization of small banks, stipulating that the capital of each small bank must be above three million yuan, and those with insufficient capital will not be allowed to exist.</p>
<p>Increase in Capital or Merger is Necessary for Existence After investigation, it is found that most of the banks in Shanghai, except for a few large banks such as Jin Cheng and Overseas Chinese, have capital of only two million yuan and deposits of around one million yuan. If small banks with insufficient capital of three million yuan are not allowed to exist in the future, the result will be that small banks will inevitably increase their capital or merge in order to continue to exist, and strict supervision will be imposed on the absorption of deposits.</p>
<p>Unauthorized Banks and Pawnshops Must Register by Deadline As of the end of last month, a total of 267 financial institutions such as banks, silver houses, silver companies, and pawnshops in the city had registered and been issued licenses in accordance with the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions. However, there are also a considerable number of people who operate without going through these procedures. The Shanghai agency of the Ministry of Finance has ordered these banks and pawnshops to apply for registration in accordance with the law before mid-August, and those who fail to do so will be severely punished and will not be allowed to operate.</p>
<p>Conserving Materials and Restricting Businesses In order to conserve various materials, the authorities will prohibit the manufacture of unnecessary items. At the same time, newly opened businesses and factories, if not necessary, will also not be allowed to be established. From January to March of this year, newly established factories and businesses included 70 banks and pawnshops, 18 grocery stores, 18 transportation and trade companies, 26 trust companies, 15 manufacturing factories, 9 insurance companies, 13 food and entertainment establishments, and 5 others, for a total of 174 companies. Some of the unhealthy ones will be inspected by the authorities.</p>

<p>Wu Yunzhai, the Lianbao chief of the Central Baojia District, recently issued an important notice to the residents of the district, stating that terrorist incidents had occurred in other districts, resulting in blockades. In order to prevent problems before they occur in this district, in addition to ordering the self-defense personnel to step up their defenses, residents should closely pay attention to the movement of household registration in their own households and neighboring households. If there is anything suspicious, they should report to the Baojia chief or the police station so that appropriate measures can be taken. If they neglect this and a terrorist incident occurs, they will be subject to a long-term blockade in accordance with the supreme command of the Japanese Navy and Army.</p>

<p>In Jinze Town, Qingpu County, Yang Jingfa, Chen Xiaodi, and Hu Wenqi recently forcibly extorted rice boats in Baitang. When they failed, they became angry and robbed all the rice, then threw the boat owner into the river to kill him. The Jinze Town Garrison Police learned the details and sent police to arrest them. After strict interrogation, the criminals confessed everything. They were sentenced to death, and all the confessions and bodies of the criminals were widely announced to serve as a warning to others. It is also learned that the three criminals, Yang, and others, were executed by firing squad at the execution ground in the town at 3:00 p.m. on the 8th. Receipt for Relief Funds from the Shanghai All Circles North China Emergency Relief Association N 000729</p>
<p>This newspaper has forwarded the disaster donation for North China to the Tongrun Qianzhuang, which is designated by the Emergency Relief Association, and the receipt No. 728 was published in yesterday's newspaper. Now the receipt No. 72 is published to show the facts, and it is hoped that the donors will check it.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Huge Demand for Emergency Relief Funds in North China <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles North China Emergency Relief Committee, in view of the vast disaster area in the north, urgently needs relief. However, due to the huge demand for funds, the Committee appealed to all circles to care for the hungry and drowning and to contribute generously, so as to gather strength and handle emergency relief. Yesterday, it was learned that people from all walks of life were very enthusiastic about donating to the relief of compatriots in the north and have directly sent them to the designated major banks and pawnshops for collection. As for the charity performances in major theaters in the water market, they are proceeding without hesitation. (1) Jin Cheng Grand Theater held a charity performance in the previous year. The entire ticket revenue that night, after deducting the entertainment tax, actually received 4,312.77 yuan in Chinese securities. However, because it failed to publicize in advance, the advertising location was relatively small, and it did not state "No donations will be solicited in the field," the audience inevitably misunderstood, which affected the income. (2) The Hebei Shanghai Association has initiated a live broadcast of famous actors and actresses raising money for disaster relief from 2:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. every day from the 10th? to the 16th at 193 Xiafei Road, French Concession. The first major achievement was very good, with 9,229 yuan in Chinese securities already collected. As for those who have recognized the fundraising but have not yet received it, the amount is 51,790.6 yuan. The Emergency Relief Committee sent personnel to collect it at the address yesterday, and it may be possible to collect it all and contribute to the event.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm of Various Schools (1) All teachers and students of the Qianye Primary and Secondary School, in view of the severe disaster situation in North China, launched a fundraising campaign. All teachers, students, and staff were extremely enthusiastic, donating a total of 7,500 yuan. Among them, some students generously donated more than one hundred yuan in white. The money has been remitted to Fuyuanzhuang. (2) The junior two students of Guangxia Middle School launched a disaster relief campaign, with students of this grade donating 550 yuan.</p>
<p>Charity Exhibition by Painters (1) Landscape painter Zhu Tianyou recently exhibited dozens of his masterpieces at the Shanghai Painting Hall on Zhejiang Road and held a solo exhibition. At the same time, five female painters, Lou Yongfen, Pang Zuoyu, Shen Yunxia, Xu Qiqin, and Sun Muhe, collaborated on fan paintings at the painting hall this afternoon (12th) for charity sales, each page for 200 yuan, and the donations were sent to the exchange agency in the name of the painting buyers. (2) Shanghai Painting Hall held a fan painting charity sale this time, in which the fan paintings sold by the two female painters, Zhou Lianxia and Wu Zaixia, raised 3,500 yuan in donations, and the paintings sold by Zheng Penglu Honglu's two younger brothers raised 200 yuan, for a total of 3,700 yuan, which has been sent directly to the Bank of Shanghai. (3) Cartoonist Huang Yebai, recently in view of the severe disaster situation in North China, made an exception to draw 100 fan paintings, each for 100 yuan, donated to the North China disaster relief fund. The collection point is the Pingbao News Agency on Yangzhou Road, Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Land, Sea, and Foreign Affairs Authorities of Japan in Shanghai jointly hosted the routine reporting meeting for the Shanghai Chinese Journalists Corps, which was held at 3:00 p.m. yesterday at the 5th floor of the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. First, Information Minister Hirota of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai Office gave a brief translation and report on current affairs for the week. The Journalists Corps asked Minister Hirota to elaborate on the customs and culture of Argentina, as Minister Hirota had stayed in Argentina for more than two years. The Minister made the following remarks: Argentina is located in the far west of South America, with a total population of over 13 million. The people are mostly of Spanish and Italian descent, and their national character is unusually optimistic. The resources are quite abundant, especially agricultural products, which are world-renowned. There are about 7,000 Japanese expatriates in the capital of Argentina, but there are few Chinese expatriates. However, there is a Chinese restaurant on the bustling streets of the capital. Later, the Journalists Corps asked the Minister about the impact of the establishment of the new Argentine revolutionary government on the Axis and Allied fronts. The Minister expressed the following: Although the revolution in Argentina has been successful, the new government has expressed its willingness to maintain its neutral policy. However, although the United States is using Argentina to alienate the Axis powers and become a pro-American target, the United Kingdom has the largest influence in Argentina in terms of the power of various countries in the world. The United States hopes that Argentina will become a neutral government that is friendly to the United Kingdom. Therefore, there are many differences in the political views of the United Kingdom and the United States. However, before the outbreak of the revolution in Argentina, the former government had a policy of being pro-. It is not yet clear what the new government's position will be on the Axis and the Allied powers.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Urgent Relief for North China: Report on Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Our newspaper is holding a charity exhibition and sale of calligraphy and painting for urgent relief in North China. Since the publication of the regulations, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically brought their treasured calligraphy works, famous paintings, and various valuable items to our office for this worthy cause. Their righteous actions and unwavering commitment are deeply appreciated. The proceeds from the charity sale will be used to purchase grain for disaster relief, so that those affected by the disaster can benefit. Blessings and rewards will surely follow those who help others, and their kindness will be reciprocated. The calligraphy and paintings received yesterday for the charity exhibition are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Liu Haisu sent a famous oil painting titled "Snow." This painting has been exhibited in Paris, Berlin, London, and various parts of Southeast Asia, and has received widespread praise. He also contributed two new Chinese paintings, "Orchid" and "Bamboo," and four calligraphy screens for the charity exhibition.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Xin Chousheng (Shenzhou Paper Mill) submitted a four-page fan album, with calligraphy by Liu Shi'an and Yu Quyuan, and landscape paintings by Zhang Dafeng and Dai Chunshi, as well as a set of four-foot landscape screens by Xu Zhucheng.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Tu Siruo donated a hanging scroll of landscape painting by Bi for the charity exhibition.</p>
<p>(4) Mr. Chen Xingchi donated a gold-decorated ink plum blossom fan by Jin Xinlan for the charity exhibition.</p>
<p>(5) Mr. Chen Ruhui donated a calligraphy scroll by Zheng Banqiao for the charity exhibition.</p>

<p>(10) Mr. Shujun donated twelve pairs of couplets, one small middle hall painting, and one small vertical scroll for the charity exhibition.</p>
<p>(11) Mr. Zhang Kuisheng donated ten fan pages. For those entrusting miscellaneous items, please allow a slightly longer time for collection. All calligraphy and painting are for charity relief (contact address: Literary and Art Studio, 3rd Floor, Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA).</p>
<h3 id="e32">Charity Calligraphy by Mr. Jin Xihou <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Jin Xihou, a famous figure in North China, deeply saddened by the suffering in North China, embraced the spirit of helping others and responded to our newspaper's call. Despite his advanced age, he created a large-format work of calligraphy, which is undoubtedly a rare and valuable piece. All proceeds from the sale will be donated to charity relief efforts. Mr. Jin Xihou was a Jinshi scholar who submitted three memorials of ten thousand words, earning him a reputation for integrity throughout the country. After the 1911 Revolution, he devoted himself to writing and completed the history of the Qing Dynasty. His mastery of ancient script and seal script is unparalleled. He occasionally paints pine and bamboo, displaying a unique and vibrant spirit. However, he does not create works for others easily.</p>
<p>Zhao Junping inherited his family's artistic tradition from a young age. He learned to paint landscapes and flowers from his teachers and relatives. His artistic style initially followed Bai Yang and Hui Shu, and later adopted the styles of Cang Shuo and Yi Ting. His use of color is similar to that of Bonian. He quickly gained fame in Beijing and Tianjin. This time, in response to the invitation of our newspaper, he contributed several of his works for charity relief. Many of his paintings have been inscribed by the great painter Mr. Zhang Yishan, making them even more valuable and worthy of purchase. All the donated paintings will be on public display for four days, starting from the 12th of this month, at the newly opened Shanghai Painting Studio at No. 462 Zhejiang Road (at the intersection of Ningbo Road). All proceeds from the charity sale will be managed and transferred by our newspaper.</p>
<p>The works of Jin and Zhao are worthy of being collected for generations. Moreover, they are now being used to help those in need, which is a truly commendable act. We hope that the people of Shanghai will take note of this. This is not only fortunate for our newspaper.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Responding to the Convention on Saving on Banquets <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Our newspaper occasionally discusses matters concerning public frugality at banquets. We are grateful that people from all walks of life have responded positively, recognizing the wastefulness of extravagance. If we can cultivate a new spirit from this and extend it to other aspects of frugality, the benefits will be even greater. The following is a list of those who agreed to participate yesterday:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Nie Lusheng (Hengfeng Yarn Factory) stated: The items listed in the convention have been practiced for ten years. Given the suffering of our people, banquets and receptions should be extremely frugal. Even in peacetime, the feasts with a variety of land and sea delicacies are unmatched by foreign countries, and even Europeans and Americans are amazed by their extravagance. A common problem in restaurants is that all the dishes are meat-based, with no vegetarian options, which is not only wasteful but also unhealthy. Everyone should promote home cooking, avoid ordering restaurant dishes, have six meat dishes and two vegetable dishes, and avoid seafood. If one hundred people abide by this, the atmosphere can be transformed.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Ding Fubao suggested: Reduce meat consumption and eat more vegetables. If too much meat and eggs are consumed, the protein will be excreted through the kidneys, which may lead to fatal kidney inflammation in the future. He has been a vegetarian for over thirty years, and his physical and mental strength has not declined.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Yao Qingsan (Jin Cheng Bank) agreed to participate.</p>
<p>(4) Mr. Zhang Qi (Sanyou Industrial Company) suggested: The number of dishes should be limited to ten, with half meat and half vegetarian.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Rural Loans and Rural Pawnshops <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Both rural loans and rural pawnshops are institutions that circulate rural funds. Although their operating methods may differ, their nature is actually the same. Recently, the Bank of Communications and other organizations formed a rural loan syndicate, and the Ministry of Industry ordered various regions to prepare for the establishment of rural pawnshops, which are indeed essential measures for the current rural revitalization and are to be congratulated.</p>
<p>Rural loans are best centered on cooperatives. Observing past situations, there are several matters that can serve as a warning and reference for us. These are presented below: (1) Before organizing cooperatives, publicity should be strengthened to allow farmers to thoroughly understand the meaning of cooperation, so as to avoid situations where it is easy to lend but difficult to collect. It is said that the performance of northern cooperatives in the past was better than that of southern cooperatives due to this reason. (2) Carefully prevent manipulation by a small number of wealthy farmers and gentry, so that genuine poor farmers are not prevented from benefiting. (3) Examine the farmers' uses for loans to ensure that they are absolutely used for production and avoid indiscriminate borrowing and misuse. All of these should be specially noted when formulating measures in order to implement the true meaning of loans and achieve practical effectiveness.</p>
<p>Rural pawnshops are simpler and quicker to organize. According to the long-standing habits of Chinese farmers, they are also more familiar and easier to promote. At the same time, due to the existence of collateral, there are no difficulties such as guarantee issues, making lending more reliable. Whether public or commercial pawnshops, we deeply feel that capital must be sufficient to establish farmers' faith, interest rates must be low to reduce farmers' burdens, and the term must be long to facilitate farmers' redemption. All of these can be said to be general principles, which must be premised on not deviating from farmers' welfare, so as to comply with the government's intention to order their establishment.</p>
<p>Both rural loans and rural pawnshops are the best methods for channeling current floating capital into financial regulation. We want to hide wealth among the people, so that the countryside will be restored and the country will be strong. This matter is most worthy of active guidance and promotion.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Regulating the Absorption of Floating Capital: The Silver and Money Industry Adjusts Deposits and Handles Half-Yearly Settlements <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>In order to regulate the absorption of social floating capital into the mainstream, the silver and money industry has reportedly decided to increase deposit interest rates, which will be handled at the discretion of each bank and shop. The banks and shops have recently adjusted various deposit interest rates accordingly, and they will be implemented starting in the second half of the year. The interest rates of Japanese banks have been increased since May 1st. (1) Interest rates for inter-bank demand deposits will be raised from below 1% to below 2%, and notice deposits will be raised from below 2% to below 3%. (2) Interest rates for customer demand deposits will be below 1%, and notice deposits will be below 2%. Special demand deposits will be raised from 1.5% to 1.8%, fixed deposits for three months or more will be raised from 3% to 3.5%, fixed deposits for six months or more will be raised from 4% to 4.5%, and fixed deposits for one year or more will be raised from 5% to 5.5%.</p>
<p>In addition, the end of June, the settlement period for the first half of this year, is fast approaching. The banks have decided to start processing it from the 15th of this month, temporarily suspending transactions with various customers in order to facilitate the settlement of interest. After the completion of the settlement at the end of the month, they will have two days off on July 1st and 2nd.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Cultivation Demonstration Farms Provide Farmers with Agricultural Loans to Purchase Seeds and Fertilizers <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The various cultivation demonstration farms, in accordance with the Ministry's order to promote rural revitalization and increase production, may seek reliable shop guarantees or invite four neighboring household heads to jointly guarantee applications for agricultural loans from farmers who have reclaimed wasteland. The procedures are as follows: (1) When each farm receives an application for an agricultural loan from a cultivator, it should immediately check the wasteland register and the cultivator register, list the names of the applicants, the number of acres cultivated, the amount of the loan requested, and the names of the guarantors in an application list, and submit it to the Ministry for approval with its opinions. If the total amount requested by each household exceeds the total loan amount of the farm, loans should first be given to cultivators with fewer than ten acres. (2) After the application list of each farm is approved, the loan date should be determined immediately, publicly announced according to the list, and notified by the local township and village leaders, but it must still be submitted to the Ministry in advance so that personnel can be sent to the farm to supervise the release of the loans. (3) After receiving the loan notification, the cultivator should immediately fill out an agricultural loan certificate, with a photo of the applicant affixed inside. If the guarantor is a shopkeeper, the manager or sole proprietor of the shop should sign and stamp the certificate, and the shop's stamp should also be affixed. If the guarantor is a neighbor, the guarantor should sign and stamp the certificate jointly. If the applicant and the guarantors have already obtained a county or city resident certificate, the certificate number should also be indicated. At least one household among the guarantors must have land property sufficient for repayment. (4) The agricultural loan should be provided in cash in principle. After receiving the loan, the cultivator should immediately remit the money to purchase seeds and fertilizers and sow and fertilize in time, and should not divert it for other purposes. If the cultivator requests the provision of seeds and fertilizers in kind, the farm should immediately purchase and provide them according to the loan amount. (5) If the cultivator diverts the loan in cash or in kind for other purposes or delays sowing, in addition to jointly repaying the loan with the guarantor, they will also be fined up to five times the amount. (6) The repayment date for summer crop agricultural loans should not exceed December 15 of the same year, and the repayment date for winter crop agricultural loans should not exceed July 15 of the following year. All repayments should be made in cash. Agricultural loans are generally interest-free, but cultivators should repay the full amount before the specified date. If the repayment is overdue, the cultivator and the guarantor should jointly repay the loan, and a penalty of 2% annual interest will be added.</p>

<p>Field workers of the Municipal Economic Bureau who are dispatched to investigate the registration of companies, factories, and businesses all hold a duty certificate issued by the Bureau, which clearly states the worker's name, title, assigned duties, and date of duty, and is stamped with a seal for identification purposes. It is understood that the Bureau, to prevent irregularities, has instructed all field workers to first show the duty certificate to verify their identity and has strictly ordered and warned all staff members that they are absolutely prohibited from engaging in extortion.
