<h3 id="c1">請求政府下決心取締囤積 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>國家一切政治經濟政策的最高目標，我們可以肯定的說，是在「改善民生」，「安定民生」。凡是一個政府，它要取得强化的地位，取得人民的擁戴，就必須致力於改善民生，安定民生。道一個原則，想執政當局決不會否認吧！</p>
<p>別的不說，目前最有關於民生的物價問題，其嚴重性仍是一天一天地增加着。如果這一問題得不到合理的解決，則一切改善民生，安定民生的辦法，都成落空的廢話。</p>
<p>我們對於解決物價問題，已經就觀感所及，屢次申論。自糧食問題，全面管制物價問題，全面實施限價問題，以至怎樣剷除黑市問題，都已發表過理論上，技術上的意見。可是一加檢討，因爲輿論界的力量，除糧食問題差見好轉之外，其餘一般物價問題，其嚴重性幷未域輕，抑且增加了。所以，我們今天再以「取締囤積」爲題，以誠摯的情緒，鄭重作如下獻議：</p>
<p>從根本上觀察，物價不斷暴漲的原因，最主要的是物資缺乏。不久以前，國民政府頒布的經濟政策綱領中，第一項卽爲「增加生產」。我們也有同感，故擁護政府盡力實踐這項工作，擬定統盤的原則，各部門的生產計劃，分期執行。凡一切足以阻礙生產，限制生產的原因，盡量消除，務期預定計劃得到實現。</p>
<p>可是就上海一地而言，向來是各種物資的集散地，經常保持着充分的儲積量，事實上不致於突然地過份缺乏。那末，這個向來充分儲積的物資，究竟到那裏去了呢？無疑的已被少數人囤積起來。所以，我們可以武斷的說，目前上海的各種物資，幷不是「眞正的缺乏」，而是「人爲的缺乏」。爲了調節物資，爲了抑平物價，更爲了安定民生，我們敢於迫切的提出，除擁護政府增加生產的計劃之外，更要求政府下最大決心取締囤積居奇。惟有澈底的取締囤積居奇，才是今天抑平物價改善民生的最有效的治標辦法。</p>
<p>無容諱言的，目　的囤積者，自政界人十以至民間各階層都有。如果眞要取締，就先從有强大政治背景的大囤虎人手，那末，不難「風行草偃」，一般中小囤積者，自知沒趣，而紛紛出籠。至於實施取締，當先調查證據，我們的建議：</p>
<p>（一）有些人嘗痛斥擾亂物價的奸商豪猾，而奸商豪猾大槪皆是在社會上比較有塲面有辦法的人，尤其是若干假藉大官勢力，就更手眼通天。奸商豪猾必須裁抑，而官吏經商，尤須嚴禁。政府本有公務員小得兼營商業的禁令，這法令就必須貫澈。所以亟盼政府淸查一下，若干官吏兼爲商業銀行或企業公司的董事長，董事，或大股東。尤須注意的是化名參加；或若干商人作了官，對這種官而商，商而官的二重人格的人，應該限令他們辭官，或者辭商，專幹一門，而不能任具進退自如，左右逢源。政府能做到這一步，則社會視聽必爲之一新，而官商分離，實際必大利於取締囤積居奇的執行。</p>
<p>（二）同時，政府應選派廉明大員，或社會上公正人士，對於政界人士有關係的商業銀行或企業公司的帳目，加以澈底的查究，運用資金是否在正當商業範圍之內？據市塲傳說：若干政界人士有關係的銀行，常有數百萬元，甚至一千萬元一紙的鉅額支票支付，就須查明它的確實用途何在？研究它的蛛絲馬跡，不爲烟幕所蔽。</p>
<p>（三）上海各銀行所置的倉庫。數量很多，而且都已貨滿。這　物資的集團，囤積的樂園，也同樣需要公正的澈底調查各貨的貨主，以及貨物寄存的時日與價格。</p>
<p>（四）囤積家的囤貨，爲了保證安全，大抵向保險公司投保。所以各保險公司的　　保戶，也是澈查的對象。</p>
<p>經過周密的澈查，得到囤積居奇的確實證據後，對這輩囤積居奇者，應有嚴厲的懲治，我們的管見：</p>
<p>奸商爲貪官的爪牙，貪官爲奸商的背景。無奸商，則貪官的犯罪，有時不免顧忌，深恐一旦破獲，無可抵賴。故普通一般狡獪者，在政府的公務員不准兼商的禁令下，均有戒備，自己不肯露面，而分布其親友故舊，使之從事經理，己則從旁操縱，上下其手，萬一事發，能彌縫則托人爲之彌縫，能减輕則設法爲之减輕，否　置身事外。所以，對若輩狡獪者，更不能放鬆，必使作法自斃，自食其果。</p>
<p>管理物價，是管物。要管物，必須管人，尤其要先管管人的人：把管人的人管好，則一般的人，可望管好，而物也可望管好。這是一個要領。戰時物價之漲，固是「常」，而不規則的跳漲，則是「非常」。「常」的部分，可從經濟道理上求解釋，「非常」的部分，大概須由政治負其咎。而造成「非常」的罪孽者，必加明法嚴刑。刑現在，以儆將來，懲一個，以儆百個。如果觸犯者爲政府高級官吏，因而迥護放縱，則一切努力，仍等於零。試舉兩個往例以證：</p>
<p>（一）民二十六年，吳鼎昌做實業部長時，上海紗布交易所有大投機行爲，吳氏親自去澈查賬目，結果檢舉出幾個投機大戶。吳氏很想懲辦一下，可是這幾個大戶，都與孔祥熙太太有關，後來由杜月笙飛往廬山見蔣說情，就此烟消雲散。</p>
<p>（二）去年重慶政權的中央信託局運輸經理林世良，當仰光軍事告緊之際，利用機會搶運商貨，案發定罪，執行檢決，此案幕後也與孔有關，而結果林則身死，經理許性初處刑，主犯則仍逍遙法外。</p>
<p>於此，可見政府非有「達官犯法與庶民同罪」的決心，來取締囤積不爲功。據聞最近財政部實業部及上海市各當局對於取締囤積，將具最大決心，我們絕對擁護；並可於這一措置能否收到實效，視爲國民政府修明政治及能否强化的試金石，同時也是取得人民的擁戴最有力的保證。</p>

<p>南京五日中央社電　五日晨中樞隆重舉行春祀典禮、汪主席親臨主祭致獻詞如下、各位同胞、各位同學、我們因爲有一位先師、所以我們除了同胞關係之外、又添上同學關係、我在去年秋祭的時節、已經說明了、在今年春祭的時候、我應該說什麼話呢、先師孔子曾說、「其言之不怍、則爲之也難」、國父孫先生曾說、「行之匪艱、知之維艱」、這兩句話、精神是一貫的、求知最艱、可是旣知之後、不難於在口裏說、而難於實行、可憐的同胞、被八股做得太久了、只會說、不會行、應該牢牢記着先師孔子的話、「其言之　怍、則爲之也難」、又應該牢牢記着國父孫先生的話、「行之匪艱、知之維艱」、空言不足以云求知、非實行不可、第一句是實行、第二句是實行、第一句還是實行、然則行些什麼呢、子貢問曰、「有一言而可以終身行之者乎」、子曰、「其恕乎、已所不欲、勿施於人」、這是從消極方面說的、如果從積極方面說、便是「己欲立而立人、己欲達而達人」、合積極、消極兩方面、儒敎的精神、可稱具備了、孟子說、「强恕而行、求仁莫近焉」、求仁的方法、不外强恕而行、所謂强恕、積極、消極兩方面、都有力行近乎仁、爲什麼呢、空言而不實行、離仁十萬八千里遠、譬如雖有救國之心、而不能擔負救國的責任、那麼只能謂之殘忍、勇猛精進、刻苦耐勞、不是空口說的、而是要實行的、興復中華、保衛東亞、只有實行才可以達到、這是今年春祭的時候、我所要貢獻於各位同胞各位同學的、</p>

<p>中日經濟懇談會東條首相之演詞</p>
<p>中日經濟的提携促進，是中日兩國互相携手，以確立大東亞共榮圈的根基，並且是不可稍緩的急務，日本政府有鑒於此，乃於二月二十九日上午九時，在首相官邸，舉行有關日華經濟提携的懇談會。</p>
<p>日本政府方面出席者爲東條首相，靑木大東亞相，山本大東亞次官，佐藤，岡陸海兩軍務局長等；民間方面出席者爲中日關係之五大實業及其他代表等。</p>
<p>開會時於東條首相及靑木大東亞相致辭（分別另詳於後一後，立即舉行懇談。各出席者均爲各界之權威，各以其豐宵的經騐及熱烈的愛國心，提供關於中日提携其體方策之詳細積極的意見。</p>
<p>首相致辭要旨</p>
<p>余以此機會，對於諸位在多年複雜的中日經濟關係中，爲國家盡了不少貢獻之功續與辛勞，深表敬意。國民政府曩以同甘共苦的立塲，更進一步，堅其同生共死的決意，對英美宣戰，表明與日本同向完遂戰爭之途邁進。日本政府乃以此次國民政府參戰爲契機，就經濟關係，對於從來的經濟諸設施，有於此機會，重新加以檢討，俾作公正而且合理的調整之決意。</p>
<p>政府所最着重之點，在於徹底實行今次所決定之方針。前次余訪中國時，當地日本官民，無不深體政府方針，出以非常的熱誠，此種實情，余實深爲欣慰。惟尙欲期待更進一步之效果者，即國民一股，尤其是在中國直接間接經營事業或參與經濟活動之日本財界中樞，應充分理解政府意旨所在，協助政府，是爲最必要而且最有效的。</p>
<p>今日已是不應再以權益或　權爭執，而應與中國國民爲伍，與彼等提携，在共存共榮的立塲，以謀經濟發展的時期了。余今日特有望於各位者，亦即在於此點。幸望今日到會各位，充分了解曩所述政府的方針，務使在當地有關之諸人，亦徹底明瞭此項趣旨，以舉實效。</p>
<p>際此大戰非常之秋，非以非常之決意而臨之不可，務請諒承政府意志，咸爲特別協力，不勝切望。</p>
<p>青木大東亞相致辭</p>
<p>（一）從來的對華經濟活動，一方面有須在中國的抗日運動勢力之下苦心經營以爲對抗的必要，一方面對於以租界爲牙城而牽制妨碍日本經濟活動之英美勢力，有須對抗的必要。又自中國事變以來，爲順應日本作戰上需要，須爲特殊的經濟活動的必要，亦爲事實。爲了此等諸種事情，日方的經濟活動，往往以特權或權益爲根據而經營，以致在中日雙方的事業之間，發生對抗觀念，此種傾向，以爲是確實有的。然而由於對英美開戰，在中國之最大的競爭者的英美勢力，已完全被徐去，而且現在國民政府及中國人士已全面的出其信賴協力的態度了，故今日當然必須把對抗觀念或國際權益思想，完全拋去，應在中日平等的基礎　，促進友好的經濟。然而久在　國經營事業者，欲使其沿着國策路綫開頭更換其向來的習慣，確也不是容易的事，此點，特有望諸位，應加以指導鞭策的。</p>
<p>（二）在中日間新關係樹立後，關於從來在中國經營着的日本方面的事業，除特殊者外，强令撤退或解散之事，從未加以考慮。不過對於事變下基於特殊理由，由日方經營把握之業務，則須根據新方針，隨其業務之性質，而各加以適當的調整，自屬當然之事。又隨着　產的移管而須變更其經營擔當者，亦可預想而知。總之，如上所述，應脫除舊習慣，於平等的立塲，以期實現眞正的中日提携的。（丁：節譯三月卅日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<p>本報爲紀念還都，於三十日這一天，特專差送報千份至京，贈發各界。本日下午四時左右，記者將報運送至中央大學，因爲上海的足球兩強聯誼和義海軍此時在該處表演友誼賽，球塲上萬頭攢動，首都球迷，大都　集，趁休息的時候，乃分四角將本報開始散發，不一時報紙被索奪一空，南京人士，與本報睽違已久，甚至有　記者本報是否在出版中，愛護本報之情，使記者感激不置。</p>
<p>在京中，我曾經拜訪過新聞界同志，民國日報的　社授，中報的　社長，中央社各位，還有華北記者團各記者，同盟社的入江先生，承他們熱誠地接待，交換意見，我們都感覺到現在新聞界的聯絡工作不够，譬如在北京，南京，天津，靑島等地，　不大容易看見申報，同時在上海亦難見到上述各地的新聞紙，在這動盪的大時代中，一中外的文化還需要交流，國內民衆的喉舌——報紙，應該先要暢通，關於這一點，我們都認爲新聞界的同仁須努力去解除這項困難，</p>
<p>南京的生活費，一般地說是比上海低，這裏不能舉出物價的例子，但是單拿米一項來說，上海現在黑市米價，是高出南京一倍，還有，譬如你到夫子廟前去吃一碗肴肉麵，半籠六個大包子，一小碗干絲，道樣的一頓早餐，總不能說「推扳」吧，在上海非二十五元以上不辦，南京呢，十二三元就够了。（續完）並言明美政府某要人、擬於近期內訪問倫敦云、</p>

<p>蘇聯的耐久力，現經事實證明不容加以輕視，故英美集中攪亂歐洲的勢力於此，視爲決定戰爭勝負的關鍵。至於軸心方面的對抗活動，近來亦日見活躍，國內態勢極度緊張，全體戰爭體系，已告完成。這歐洲的廣域全體戰爭的新體系，爲了對抗英美的體系，應怎樣適應當前緊急的事態而再加以强化？記者（若山，山本二特派員）爲欲明瞭構成廣域經濟戰爭體系之基礎的歐洲經濟的國際間相互關係，特訪問巴賽國際決算銀行的耶可勃生，及有力的國際經濟通二三人，並與之交換意見。當然，中立國的立場現在頗爲微妙，一部份議論雖頗正確，然也有不少偏見。會談內容，富有興味。</p>
<p>耶可勃生是瑞典人，爲國際決算銀行的顧問。他爲國際決算銀行按年報吿書的編輯者，是熟悉國際經濟的專門家，同時又爲衆所矚望的財政家。他在英國的李滋羅斯赴華改革幣制以前，曾應日本的招聘，後以事不果，迄今尙懷念不已，對於日本立塲的理解，頗爲公正。</p>
<p>其他諸氏也都是國際經濟專家，但都不能跳出長期間自由經濟思想的薰陶，懷抱着自由經濟在將來尙有可能的幻夢，很少瞭解歷史之必然演進。</p>
<p>第一點質問：「不問歐洲諸國是否願意，爲了對抗蘇聯的共產化及英美的經濟封鎖，今後是否應與德義有更密切的提携。」關於此點，並沒有提到明白的結論。經訊者們質問的諸氏，都以此爲歐洲諸國人民對德信賴的問題，而記者們則是專從現實的物的基礎立論。</p>
<p>英美因爲沒有戰敗德義的實力，故用戰後的的束，策動擾亂歐洲，業已有很長久的時日了。最近的新聞雜誌，侈談戰後的問題等，一見即知其爲誇大的架空宣傳。而德義的立塲，雖不免有多平困難，但無疑的想把歐洲諸國連結起來。</p>
<p>談到淸算協定的現狀。淸算協定最初視爲解決對德資產凍結的對策，由德國與對手諸國商議後開始的，至目前已日見擴大，除西班牙，葡萄牙，土耳其外，歐洲十七個國家都根據多角的淸算協定而經由拍林互相聯絡起來，這是構成歐洲全體戰爭體系之一種技術的基礎。他面，在戰時下的今日，困難雖多，但最大的問題，歐洲諸國輸出至德國的，較從德國輸入的爲多，結果，對德債權遂見增大。</p>
<p>有人視對德債權的增加爲淸算協定前途悲觀的緣由。德國對此解釋爲「對德債權的性質，猶如存儲於德國戰時長期儲金，戰後用物的形式漸由德國供給償還。」故對德債權的增加，不足資以悲觀的理由，將來這債權使歐洲諸國與德義更加密切提携，以求戰勝歐洲全體戰爭之物的基礎。</p>
<p>次一質問是「對德債權達到了相當數額之後，各國政府因預支的關係，歐洲諸國必然增發不兌換紙幣而引起通貨膨脹，對此有何意見？」</p>
<p>關於通貨膨脹問題，各人均一致抱着樂觀的見解，認爲前次大戰後所發生的事態，暫時將不復見於今日。其理由：</p>
<p>第一經濟的統制組織之完備；</p>
<p>第二惡性通貨膨脹的後果，大家都已有相當的知識。</p>
<p>第三資本這東西的支配力，已被抑制。</p>
<p>即政治的力量，對於有組織的經濟活動，遠較前次大戰爲强大。社會施設的擴充，使後方生活得以安定，同時，統制價格，减低銀行利息，使資本無從食得暴利。又籌措戰費的方法，也極力抑制依存公債的陳法，而吸收剩餘購買力，故任何國家都相次增稅，在租稅上所負擔的戰費百分率，各國都比前次大戰有顯著的增加。從這些事情考察起來，至少將不致發生似上次大戰後所引起的通貨膨脹。黃金的將來，有許多有力的見解以爲在戰後仍食相當的任務，但因美國的金政策如何而將有相當的變化。其他許多問題，亦曾加討論，總之，感情問題，蒙蔽了判斷現實的眼光，對於未來的必然的動向，沒有確固的覺悟。這是記者們所獲得的印象。</p>
<p>但在他方面，記者們又看到現實的情勢，把上述想法毫不饒赦地予以推翻。農業國的巴爾幹諸國，爲何不能不生彥一定量的食糧品？中立國的瑞士，爲何不能不在山上墾植園地，拆除公園中的花草而種植馬鈴薯？總而言之，此次戰爭的特色，戰事中犧牲的負擔者，不是某一部分而是廣泛的全體國民層，不問其願否，而由幾個國家的國民層共同分擔。關於此點。某氏稱「美國的軍備租借案也好，通過歐洲淸算協定而使對德債權增加的問題也好，都證明此次戰爭是廣域全體戰爭的活動。」因爲戰爭的目的與希望非常之大，所以戰爭的方法，雖在參戰的國家，也不能不各有不同，因而不能不制止物資之片面的流通。此次戰爭的犧牲小能僅由一個國家負擔，而必要求數個國家共同負擔。沒有一個人能對戰爭無所關心，即使是歐洲的一個小國，也不能越出歐洲的戰爭圈外。（瑞士巴賽二十日若山。山本兩特派員發——翔：譯自三月二十二日西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>— 劉寒若</p>
<p>國府還都以來，中國陸海空軍，在日本協助之下，重新建造起來。新海軍的再建，亦如新春萌芽地在滋長着。</p>
<p>威海衛海軍基地砲艇海翔號，和上海的練習艇海興號，因爲參加慶祝還都紀念，特由防區駛往南京，受汪主席檢閱之後，任務完畢，日前開來上海，碇泊在南京路外灘碼頭，記者爲了要看一看這新中國的海軍容貌，特地作一次匆促的訊問。</p>
<p>國徽下面劃着白十字中國海軍旗，飄揚在黃浦江上，兩艘軍艦靜靜地泊在　船邊，因爲中國的海軍不常在黃浦江上出現，所以有好多人在岸上向她倆投着好奇的眼光，自然，海翔海興的艦身大小，是不能和泊在江心的其他國大軍艦相比。但是，吿訴你：這僅僅是練習艦，和江防砲艦呵！</p>
<p>在海翔艦上，因爲艦長因公上岸，只會見了副艦長李繼康少校，是一位壯健的身軀，英俊的外貌，談話很溫和的靑年。承李少校吿訴記者關於海翔的一切：</p>
<p>「海翔是砲艇，八百六十五噸，長二百英尺，航海普通速度十海哩，全速達十三海哩，配備有大砲兩尊，新式高射機槍兩挺，全艦官佐二十名，士兵一百名，海軍學校見習生二十名，海翔是威海衛要塞基地艦隊之一，三十年八月由日本交靛歸我國管理，艦長是馬雲生君。」</p>
<p>艦上各處整潔有序，士兵們精神煥發，白的制服，「中華民國海軍」帽徽在各部浮　着，這就是未來的「中華帶礪，東亞金湯」！</p>
<p>參觀了海翔之後，李副艦長復同記者往海興號參觀，承該艦副艦長陳連珂君領導，對海興再作一天巡視。據陳艦副吿訴記者：「海興除瞭艦尾部份比海翔號稍高外，一切都與海翔大同小異，她是民國十七年在英國建造，現在爲上海海軍學校作練習艦」。在艦面上看見了許多人在運用望遠鏡，或是勤勉地在檢視機械，想是海軍的學生在實習了。</p>
<p>巡視完了兩艦，我們回至岸上，眼看到黃浦江畔，我們的海軍旗在迎風搖曳着，我不禁暗暗地爲新中國海軍前途祝福！</p>

<p>安定物價在於增加生產：欲求生產力之增進，首先要疏通原料來源。在目前，國外的原料，因無法取得，顧國內各地之農產品，礦產品，在在足爲工業品之原料，且可替代國外原料，倘能改善交通機構，加增運輸效率，將內地各處之農產原料，儘量運入工業區，如上海·蘇州·杭州·南京各地，再以工厰之機製品，儘量輸入內地，實行物物交換之辦法，則原料來源　暢，價格自能平定。蓋成本既廉；一切物價，自然可以低落。不但華中部分，即華北與華中，華中與華南，倘各以本地之特產品互動販運，俾合物資交流之原則，則各地物價自能一致平定，一般人民對於物資缺乏之恐慌心理，亦可無形消滅。故目下除用政治力量限價外並須疏通物資來源；是當改善交通運輸機構，使原料來源，日多一日，工厰生產力，一致增進，則供求適合，物資相通，而當前最困難之物價問題，自可迎刃而解。</p>

<p>南京五日中央社電　自國民政府正式參戰後，我國戰時體制，逐漸確立，而經濟財政體制，亦得漸吿鞏固。記者特於昨日走訪財政部陳之碩次長，叩問關於最近國府財政經濟上諸問題，承一一作答如次：</p>
<p>問：我國戰時下財政的特點？</p>
<p>答：戰時下的我國財政，必先抓住其特點，我政府現經協力於大東亞戰爭，實行參戰，　當前財政上的重點，厥爲增產。增產　業，種類不一，尤以「化散爲整化無爲有」爲最要，凡散佈于國內各地之物力或人力，必使其集中，以貢獻於大東亞戰爭。</p>
<p>問：現在戰時的特別課稅有未實施？</p>
<p>答：現在尚無特別課之徵收，目無特別課稅之必要。</p>
<p>問：請問目前國內民眾對於担負賦稅的能力如何？</p>
<p>答：現在民眾不僅有負担現下賦稅的能力，即對於賦稅的認識，亦頗能深切瞭解，實爲良好現象。即有增稅，确信一般民眾，必能認淸目標，協助政府完成大業，而不致感受如何痛苦。</p>
<p>問：此次友邦日本在華各地軍票停止發行後，對於我國幣制前途，影響頗大，閣下所見如何？</p>
<p>答：自國府還都以後，首先籌設中央儲備銀行，予以發行特權，以爲統一幣制，奠定金融之基礎。三載以來，初則取消華興劵之發行權，繼則廢止中儲劵與舊法幣之等價流通，旋又取消舊法幣之法定通貨性，終使舊法幣絕跡，以至和平區內，無不以中儲劵爲唯一通貨。關於軍票，友邦日本爲協助我國完成統一通貨政策，自四月一日起，停止軍票之新發行與過去舊法幣之取消，在意義上原無二致，所不同者其收回辦法，一採斷然處置，一取自然趨勢耳。</p>
<p>問：我國能否避免通貨膨脹現象的發生？</p>
<p>答：現在中儲劵之發行額，僅二十餘億，較之各地需要相差尚多，在昧於經濟及金融之原則者以物價高漲而慮及通貨膨脹，實不知中儲劵現保有六成以上準備金，無論目前將來，絕不至有通貨膨脹之現象也。</p>

<p>中央社滬訊　糧食部長顧寳衡氏，近爲推進糧食統制問題，連日在滬與本市各業領袖等聯絡，並指示方針。記者特於昨（五）日走訪顧氏，叩詢關於統制糧食聯營社組織問題，承發表談話如下：本月一日京滬各報所載糧食部統制糧食聯營社組織通則，原係研　性質之草案，並未公布施行，自國府明令公布　商同業公會暫行條例後，此項擬議自成過去。除米穀商（米穀糯米）仍依據特別法組織各地區米穀採銷總管理處管轄外，其他各種糧食業如麵粉雜糧粙糖蛋茶牲畜等業，均應在糧食部糧食局及縣市政府各主管官廳之指導監督下，由各該業商人組織同業公會，由各地同業公會合組同　聯合會，由各種同業聯合會集合組織成商業　制總會（對外貿易業暫除外），完成高度自治之統制機構。各下層機構之同業公會，及聯合會均受商業統制總會之直接管轄，由商業統制總會總其大成，而糧食部則就糧食關係部份對商業統制總會盡其指導監督之職責。再四日各報載有本部職掌之業務類別中，誤將麵粉列爲棉花，至於食鹽因稅務關係，有其特別專管機關，故不屬糧食部管理。此外尚有若錯誤之點，不及列舉，請概以三月三十一日本人招待商業統制總會理監事及各業領袖席上所發表談話之新聞報導爲標準，以免外界不明真情，以訛傳訛。</p>

<p>自由談利用空閒  獄徒　　一個靑年將來有多少成就，只要有他如何利用他的零碎的本閒時間，便可決定。專門叫着，想着『我沒有工夫』的人，他　眞的好似沒有空閒了。但有些在忙　偷閒的人，他的志向在那兒，那兒就會有時　，因爲無論甚麼人他絕對不會找不出空閒與時間，除非是把空閒做不正當的事，或者是去瞌睡。所以會利用空間的人，可以幫助他成功，不會利用的反而把空閒利用着作有害身心的事情，去找出一條墮落的路給自己走。　　我們往往奇怪有許多父兄們的朋友，他們並不會進過什麼學校，而且大部份是學生意」出身，但他們却看得很多的書，還寫得一手好字……這是甚麼原因呢？這全是他們利用空閒所得到的報酬，憑良心說「我們現在無論如何的忙，總沒有他們在當「學徒」時候的忙吧！但他們說在忙中偷出一會兒工夫看幾頁書，寫幾張字總是可以的，」那麼我們呢？　　不妨自間『我們那些寳　的空閒時間到那兄去了？是元全派了正當用途了嗎？』科學小品漫談「癌症」  蓬六　　提起筆來不由得想到了三種可：癌症的危險着實可怕；而可怕的癌症竟可用一種光綫去治療，那却亦可怪；　在科學昌明的今日，癌症的常識在中國還不很普及，又不得不感到可憐。　　說到癌症，端的可怕，生了這病，少則數月，多則數年，必將奉召歸天。原來所謂痛者是身體某一部分細胞變態的過　畸形生長而成，任何部分都可發生；而所謂畸形生長就是說在正常情形及普通一般疾病所無；這種細胞的分化生長，其迅速實難以置信，眞像俗語所說的『日長夜大」。細胞旣在那末迅速生長，當需豐　營養，於是全身各部所需養料都被它們掠奪，以致患者極度贏弱；而目這種細胞與正常細胞更有不同：即使身體營養已瀕枯竭，它們却還依然故　地盡剝削榨取之能事，直至死而後已。然而癌的可怕非僅此也，癌在生長期間，一面不停地向外長大，一面却向組織內部深入，恰似地下的樹根，　枝四佈並無一定範圍，若要剜　眞剜不勝剜，而常深入而遇到仟何器官臟腑時，它亦排闥而入，或與臟腑生牢，或將臟腑破壞貫穿而繼續生長，使臟腑失去功能。尤有甚者，癌細胞還有遷移的特性，大有「竄頭之勢」，某部有了癌，不久又可在別部同樣發生（例如乳癌時可使腋下亦生癌），因此即使用盡方法將癌除去，但仍多復發，『野火燒不盡，春風吹又生」，眞此之謂。癌到最後，太身固必潰破而爛得慘不睹，生　亦就此　送。　　這樣可怕的癌，論理我們應得明白它的病因而從事預防：不幸得很，癌症的　因雖經無數科學家絞盡謫汁絕研究，雖有幾種理論創立，有的以爲因年齡變遷（癌大都發生於老年，幼年時可說絕無）而體內內分泌的變化，有的說爲了多受刺激，有的更創其他學說，但確切的原因到現在還未明白，况且癌症亦似無傳染　人的可能，所以根本無從預防，祗能在旣發之後治療。　　癌的治療，以前大家相信的用手術剜除之法並不澈底，幸而有兩個法國科學家居禮夫婦發現了鐳，癌症才算有了比較美滿的治法。現在最新的方法是外科手術，X光照射及鐳錠照射三者並用，可以收到宏效。　　可是這種方法，亦祗是比較美滿而尚非全合理想，因爲什數種癌（例如子宮口，乳房，陰戶，鼻腔等的癌）早期時確可用以治愈，但在晚期　亦　是毫無把握，至多祗能延長數　壽命，而且還有　種癌（例如食道，肺，胃，腸等的癌，）卽使早期亦不能用這種　法治愈。所以說到頭來，不管痛症常識如何可憐，光綫治療如何可怪，而癌症却畢竟還是可怕的。控制欲望  張心　　人有天賦一雙眼睛看東西，一對耳朶聽東西，以及一副腦子想東西，世界的變動，人事的滄桑，不會聽見就會看見，看過或聽過之後，腦子就會想見其中的道理，所以時代是沒字的書本，生活是豐富的敎育，就是不識字的人，決不能說沒　習，訓練過，宇宙的紛紜百態，每天都映上他的眼　，敲擊他的耳鼓，刺　他的　筋，他不能　而不　，不能無動於中，除非是　盲又聾又白痴的人。　　因此，誰都會懂得一些做人的道理，例如成功的來由，失敗的根源，怎樣才有出息，怎樣是趨墮落等，耳濡目染不會不知道，那末，每個人都聰明地棄惡而趨善，不很　麼？爲什麼仍有人爲非作歹呢？說是迫於生活，沒可奈何吧！是的，這是小偷之類的理由，還有另外許多人都衣無不暖，食無不飽，住無不適了，爲什麼也同樣地做出損人利已的行爲來？惟一的原因，就任「欲望」這東西在作祟，他們都爲無饜的欲望所迷惑，而控制不住牠。　　所　欲海難塡，得隴望蜀，原是人類一種劣根性，我們要控制住牠，然後能捨己爲人，造福社會，若讓牠放縱，就損人利已，造禍社會，如無韁之馬，一發不可收拾了。　　愼思，愼行以及簡樸的生活，是控制欲　的方法，火試騐金子，欲望試騐你，控制得住欲望，不讓牠控制你，就見得你的偉大　。責任心  示羊　　一般人大槪都有這種感覺吧，就是在一件事情未實行之先他常常感到憂慮，在事情完成之後他感到喜悅。事情未成之先他爲甚麼要憂慮呢？因爲放在面前的事要他去做這就是說他已負起這件事情的責什。爲了不能逃避這責任和無法獲得別人的幫助，於是他內心開始不安起來。他恐懼事情的劉方會阻碍他的進行　引起他的失敗。但一旦事情成功之後，那時一陣喜悅亦難形容了，因爲責任已經卸除，使他沉下了心中的大石。而且在一次的奮鬬中，他得到了不　經騐，以後遇到相同情形時，他有了應付的方法，無庸冉作不必要的杞憂。　　事情辦得多了常常覺得容易應付，而且也肯負責。這就證明他的經騐充足，所以不懼煩難。未習世故少經騐的人，往往因　恐怕遭受麻煩，不肯負上資任。因此　有事情的到來，他終設法逃　，推諉。　　逃避，推諉或許可以解除目前的困難，然而日後引起的困難就大了。他與外界的接　不能普遍，他不能得到豐富的經騐，日辦事的效能也就受到很大的　響。於是逢到繁難事情時，他只有請謁他人，求他人同他決策。這樣豈非痛苦？　　所以責任的到來，並不要恐懼，亦不要逃避，只有迎頭去做。牠因此而磨練你的毅力，增加你的智慧。而一時的困難却增强了日後的辦事能力與效果。根  辛波　　「眞的麼？——」就這樣一句，不說下去，似乎他在想什麼心事。　　路漸漸低下去，低到只高出平地二三丈一塊大磐石平鋪着的地方。這是小戴山和靈山的交界，也是靈山灣向東通到外面去的咽喉之地。牠叫龍虎門，果然像一個門由靈山作龍小靈山作虎把守　。有些孩子們在磐石上跳着說：「底下有金車銀　呢，江西人來看過的！』說了，還將耳朵貼到石上去聽聽，然後立起來說：「底下的確有在在汪　　　的車軸聲。」　　阿五和大根走過了磨石，上了靈山的脚。這比小靈山要陡得多，並且遍是黃石，並沒有可以種植的黃土。不過路上的黃石，鋪成了一步一步的階級，走起來也還便利。　　向上走了一會，他們到了半山中的一個廟宇。這是三茅殿，山門前鋪　平平的石板，上山來的人差不多總要在這裏透口氣，然後再進入裏面去，或再向上去。他們到了這裏，也就停下來，看着東面的景色。因爲南面有小靈山遮着，北面有靈山的本身隔着，西面就是靈山灣，只有東西才是一片空曠，可以看到無窮遠。　　「你到過我們家裏的五堡墩麼？』阿五指港山下相近處一簇村莊問。　　『到過的。』　　「哦，那房子最多的就是前塘橋了，』阿五將頭抬起了一些又說，「你也到過麼？』　　『到過的。週圍十里之內，我都到過。不過再遠些，我就不去了，因爲也有別人要做生意的，我只在十里之內做生意。』（三千四）秋海棠  史新　　評話劇和評京劇當然兩樣。演　爲中心的是許京劇的態度，內容爲中心的是評話劇的態度。　　秋海棠在卡爾登演過一百幾十塲，天天客滿。但是評牠的文字倒很少，好像只有親民君　本報一篇不滿千字的「秋海棠觀感」而已，好得此篇文字評得非常妥切。　　不過，日本人朋友在，陸報曾把牠和日本的小築地」相比稱讚　，公平地說有點　於「熱昏」。　久一先生對於話劇本來是內行人，我勸先生到大世界游藝塲去看有文明戲，這　比秋海棠好的中國戲是太多了。社會服務小學敎師醫藥助金　中法藥房慨助二千元　　本　爲尊重師道，提倡互助精神起見，發起小學敎師　藥助金，迭蒙各界熱烈贊助。前日兒童節，承中法大　房　捐醫藥助金二千元，拜領之餘，特此誌謝，並望各界熱心人十源源接濟，俾淸寒敎師咸受其惠。醫藥界優待敎師　　（一）　本市助產學會，願爲淸寒小學敎師免費接生，請撥電話三七〇四七即可。倘各界委託檢騐保姆體格以及化騐乳汁，均由該會員義務代辦，惟須先行聲請登記。（二）上海防勞協會肺病第二醫院對於貧病者，本有免費診治之舉，以後凡由本報介紹求診者仍常予以優待。收款報告　　　　金：二月底結存二九，六〇七·七〇元，三月份收人九，一〇六·〇〇元，三月份支出三〇〇·〇〇元，結存三八，四一三·七〇元。　小本貸金：二月底結存七，一九〇·〇〇元，三月份收入二，五〇〇·〇〇元，三月份支出九〇〇·〇〇元，結存八，七九〇•〇〇元。　小敎助金：二月底結存三四，八〇八·〇〇元，三月份收入三九，四二一•五〇元，三月份支出四〇·二〇〇·〇〇元，結存三四，〇二九•五〇元。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Request to the Government to Resolve to Suppress Hoarding <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>We can assert with certainty that the highest goals of all national political and economic policies are to "improve the people's livelihood" and "stabilize the people's livelihood." Any government that wants to achieve a strengthened position and gain the support of the people must devote itself to improving and stabilizing the people's livelihood. The ruling authorities would certainly not deny this principle!</p>
<p>Aside from other issues, the most pressing problem related to the people's livelihood is the issue of commodity prices, the severity of which is increasing day by day. If this issue is not reasonably resolved, then all measures to improve and stabilize the people's livelihood will become empty talk.</p>
<p>Regarding the resolution of the commodity price problem, we have repeatedly expressed our opinions based on our observations. From the food issue to the comprehensive control of commodity prices, to the comprehensive implementation of price limits, and even how to eradicate the black market, we have published theoretical and technical opinions. However, upon further review, because of the power of public opinion, except for the food issue which has shown some improvement, the severity of other general commodity price issues has not lessened, but has even increased. Therefore, today we address the topic of "Suppressing Hoarding" again, with sincere emotion, solemnly offering the following suggestions:</p>
<p>From a fundamental perspective, the main reason for the continuous surge in commodity prices is the shortage of goods. Not long ago, the National Government issued an economic policy outline, the first item of which was "Increase Production." We share the same sentiment and therefore support the government's efforts to implement this task, formulating comprehensive principles and phased production plans for each department. All factors that hinder or restrict production should be eliminated as much as possible, so as to ensure that the planned goals are achieved.</p>
<p>However, taking Shanghai as an example, it has always been a distribution center for various goods, maintaining a sufficient reserve volume. In fact, it should not suddenly experience an excessive shortage. So, where have these previously sufficient reserves of goods gone? Undoubtedly, they have been hoarded by a few people. Therefore, we can assert that the current shortage of various goods in Shanghai is not a "genuine shortage," but a "man-made shortage." In order to regulate goods, suppress commodity prices, and, more importantly, stabilize the people's livelihood, we dare to urgently propose that in addition to supporting the government's plan to increase production, we also demand that the government make the greatest determination to suppress hoarding and speculation. Only by thoroughly suppressing hoarding and speculation can we effectively treat the symptoms of suppressing commodity prices and improving the people's livelihood today.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that hoarders are found among people in the political circles as well as various levels of the population. If we really want to suppress hoarding, we should start with the big tigers with strong political backgrounds. Then, it will not be difficult to achieve "wind sweeping the grass," and general small and medium-sized hoarders, knowing that they have no chance, will emerge from their hiding places. As for the implementation of suppression, we should first investigate the evidence. Our suggestions are:</p>
<p>(1) Some people often denounce the treacherous merchants and powerful figures who disrupt commodity prices, but these merchants and powerful figures are mostly people who are relatively prominent and resourceful in society. Especially those who falsely use the power of high-ranking officials have even more extensive connections. Treacherous merchants and powerful figures must be curbed, and officials engaging in business must be strictly prohibited. The government already has a ban on civil servants concurrently operating businesses, and this law must be thoroughly implemented. Therefore, we urge the government to investigate which officials are concurrently serving as chairmen, directors, or major shareholders of commercial banks or enterprises. Special attention should be paid to participation under assumed names; or which merchants have become officials. These people with dual identities of official and merchant, merchant and official, should be required to resign from their official positions or their businesses, focusing on one career only, and should not be allowed to advance and retreat freely, having their way in both worlds. If the government can achieve this step, the public perception will be refreshed, and the separation of officials and merchants will be practically beneficial to the enforcement of suppressing hoarding and speculation.</p>
<p>(2) At the same time, the government should select honest and upright officials or impartial members of society to thoroughly investigate the accounts of commercial banks or enterprises related to people in the political circles. Is the use of funds within the scope of legitimate business? According to market rumors, banks related to some people in the political circles often have huge checks of several million or even ten million yuan issued. It is necessary to investigate the exact purpose of these checks, study the clues, and not be obscured by smokescreens.</p>
<p>(3) The warehouses owned by various banks in Shanghai are numerous and fully stocked. This group of goods, a paradise for hoarding, also needs a fair and thorough investigation to determine the owners of the goods and the dates and prices at which the goods were deposited.</p>
<p>(4) To ensure safety, hoarders usually insure their goods with insurance companies. Therefore, the policyholders of various insurance companies are also subject to thorough investigation.</p>
<p>After a thorough investigation to obtain conclusive evidence of hoarding and speculation, those engaged in hoarding and speculation should be severely punished. Our humble opinions are:</p>
<p>Treacherous merchants are the henchmen of corrupt officials, and corrupt officials are the background of treacherous merchants. Without treacherous merchants, the crimes of corrupt officials would sometimes be restrained, fearing that once they are caught, there would be no way to deny it. Therefore, ordinary cunning people, under the government's ban on civil servants engaging in business, are prepared, unwilling to show their faces themselves, but distributing their relatives and old friends to engage in management, while they themselves manipulate from the sidelines, taking advantage of the situation. In case something happens, if they can cover it up, they ask people to cover it up; if they can reduce the punishment, they try to reduce the punishment; otherwise, they stay out of it. Therefore, these cunning people cannot be let go, and they must be made to suffer the consequences of their actions.</p>
<p>Managing commodity prices is managing goods. To manage goods, one must manage people, especially those who manage people first: manage those who manage people well, then the general population can be expected to be managed well, and goods can also be expected to be managed well. This is a key point. The rise in commodity prices during wartime is "normal," but irregular jumps are "abnormal." The "normal" part can be explained from an economic point of view, and the "abnormal" part must be blamed on politics. Those who create the sin of "abnormal" must be punished with clear laws and severe penalties. Punish the present to warn the future, punish one to warn hundreds. If the offenders are high-ranking government officials, and they are protected and indulged, then all efforts will be in vain. Let's cite two past examples to prove this:</p>
<p>(1) In 1937, when Wu Dingchang was the Minister of Industry, there was large-scale speculation in the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange. Wu himself went to thoroughly investigate the accounts and uncovered several major speculators. Wu wanted to punish them, but these major speculators were all related to Madame Kong Xiangxi. Later, Du Yuesheng flew to Lushan to intercede with Chiang, and the matter vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>(2) Last year, Lin Shiliang, the Transportation Manager of the Central Trust Bureau of the Chongqing regime, took advantage of the tense military situation in Yangon to seize the opportunity to rush transport commercial goods. The case was investigated, convicted, and executed. This case was also related to Kong behind the scenes, but as a result, Lin died, manager Xu Xingchu was punished, and the main culprit remained at large.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the government must have the determination of "officials committing crimes and civilians being treated equally" in order to suppress hoarding effectively. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Shanghai authorities are determined to suppress hoarding with the greatest determination. We absolutely support this and can regard whether this measure can achieve practical results as a touchstone for the National Government's improvement of politics and its ability to strengthen itself, and at the same time, it is the most powerful guarantee for gaining the support of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Solemn Confucius Ceremony Held by Civil and Military Officials and Students in the Capital; Chairman Wang Personally Led the Ceremony in National Dress, and Another State Council Member, Fu Tong, Was Dispatched to Qufu to Offer Sacrifices <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The 5th was the date of the spring sacrifice to the teacher Confucius. In addition to dispatching State Council Member Fu Tong to Qufu to offer sacrifices, the central authorities showed solemnity. Civil officials wore formal dress, military officers wore military uniforms with swords, and students uniformly wore student uniforms. Over two thousand civil and military officials and representatives from student and civilian groups attended. At the beginning of the ceremony, the atmosphere was solemn and reverent. Around 9 a.m., ministers Chen Gongbo, Wen Zongyao, Jiang Chonghu, Liang Hongzhi, Chen Qun, Chu Minyi, Li Shengwu, Lin Baisheng, Xu Suzhou, Tang Mang, Qian Yuandao, Bao Wenyue, Xiao Shuyi, Ye Peng, and others arrived one after another.

<h3 id="e3">Chairman Wang's Speech: Revitalize China and Defend East Asia <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – This morning, the central authorities solemnly held the spring sacrifice ceremony. Chairman Wang personally presided over the ceremony and delivered the following speech: Fellow compatriots, fellow students, because we have a teacher, we have a student-teacher relationship in addition to our compatriot relationship. I already explained this during the autumn sacrifice last year. What should I say at this spring sacrifice? The teacher Confucius once said, "It is difficult to act on words that one is not ashamed to speak." The Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, once said, "It is not difficult to act, but it is difficult to know." The spirit of these two sentences is consistent. It is most difficult to seek knowledge, but once known, it is not difficult to speak it, but difficult to put it into practice. Pitiful compatriots, you have been writing in the eight-legged essay style for too long, you only know how to speak, not how to act. You should firmly remember the words of the teacher Confucius, "It is difficult to act on words that one is not ashamed to speak." You should also firmly remember the words of the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, "It is not difficult to act, but it is difficult to know." Empty words are not enough to be called seeking knowledge; it must be put into practice. The first sentence is practice, the second sentence is practice, and the first sentence is still practice. Then, what should we practice? Zigong asked, "Is there a single word that can be practiced for a lifetime?" Confucius said, "It is perhaps 'reciprocity.' Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire." This is from a negative perspective. If we speak from a positive perspective, it is "Establish others as you would establish yourself, and advance others as you would advance yourself." Combining the positive and negative aspects, the spirit of Confucianism can be said to be complete. Mencius said, "To practice reciprocity vigorously is the closest way to seek benevolence." The method of seeking benevolence is none other than practicing reciprocity vigorously. What is meant by vigorously practicing reciprocity? Both the positive and negative aspects are forcefully practiced, approaching benevolence. Why is this so? Empty words without practice are ten thousand miles away from benevolence. For example, even if one has the heart to save the country, but cannot bear the responsibility of saving the country, then one can only be called cruel. Being brave and diligent, persevering and enduring hardship, are not just empty words, but must be put into practice. Revitalizing China and defending East Asia can only be achieved through practice. This is what I want to contribute to my fellow compatriots and students at this spring sacrifice.</p>

<p>Hankou, 5th (Central News Agency) – Since the 23rd of last month, various Japanese troops have fiercely attacked the troops of the 180th Division of the Chongqing Army entrenched in the area north of Jingmen, completely defeating them. Continuing on the 31st, they fiercely attacked Lixi, a battalion of the Chongqing Army 33 kilometers north of Jingmen, and by evening, they had driven them all north. On the 1st of this month, a battalion of the Chongqing Army on the high ground about four kilometers east of Lixi was fiercely attacked by the Japanese army and retreated north as well. In the war results gained by the Japanese army in the past two days, it is estimated that 1,000 Chongqing Army soldiers were killed, four were captured, and one light machine gun and eight rifles, along with countless bullets, were seized. In addition, another Japanese army unit went to suppress about 300 New Fourth Army soldiers along the Beijing-Hankou Railway near Dachengshan on the 31st of last month, completely repelling them.</p>
<p>Qingdao, 5th (Central News Agency) – In order to eliminate about 2,500 troops of the Cai Ming Guerrilla Fourth Column under Wang Shangzhi, entrenched in the counties of Pingdu and Changyi in eastern Shandong Province, the Japanese army's elite punitive force began operations on the 31st of last month. At dawn on the 1st, they attacked the main force of the enemy army, about 400 strong, entrenched in Fanjiagyi and (22 kilometers southeast of Changyi), annihilating most of them. The war results obtained by the Japanese army in this battle: 1. 106 Chongqing Army soldiers were found dead. 2.

<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Today at 1 p.m., the Grand China's Participation in the War Lecture Meeting was grandly held at the Hibiya Public Hall. The ceremony was performed as usual. First, General Iwane Matsui, Vice President of the Xingya Alliance, gave an opening speech. Then, Xu Liang, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, and others successively gave important speeches on their determination to live and die together and to destroy Britain and the United States after China's participation in the war. Subsequently, Fengyi Tsushima, President of the North China Development Corporation, and Huanming Okawa, Doctor of Law, gave speeches on the economic development of China participating in the war and on appealing to the people of the new China. After each speaker finished, Chinese films, the China Amusement Conference, and "Real Records of Peaceful Nation Building" were shown. Finally, Tokyo Mayor Kishimoto led everyone in shouting slogans and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Former Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Xu Liang, gave a speech at the "China's Participation in the War Lecture Meeting" in today, saying that he had asked Chairman Wang for permission to resign because his parents were old, and luckily Chairman Wang granted it. He will return to China within days. From then on, he can serve his parents at home and contribute to the Great East Asia War abroad. He will have no regrets for both public and private matters, and he is even more delighted. Recalling that since his arrival, he has received various assistance from all levels of your country, which enabled him to complete his important mission. He would like to take this opportunity to express his heartfelt gratitude to everyone and bid farewell. Although he is returning to China, he will continue to fight for the Great East Asia War, regardless of time or region. We will never rest until we achieve final victory. Before China's participation in the war, some Chinese people thought that the Great East Asia War was someone else's business. This national mentality was the biggest obstacle to Sino-Japanese cooperation and the construction of the New Order in East Asia. Now that China has participated in the war, the Chinese people should know that Japan is a comrade-in-arms who lives and dies together, and standing idly by is absolutely not allowed. Moreover, after participating in the war, the concessions have been recovered and extraterritorial rights have been abolished. What the Chinese patriots have died fighting for for decades has now been realized. Chongqing has lost its ability to resist. In the future, the entire China will be able to cooperate in the Great East Asia War. The unprecedented glory of East Asia will surely be realized. He will report to the government and the people in detail about the true situation of your assistance to China and the calmness, loyalty, and courage that should be shown in this Great East Asia War. At the same time, he will thank everyone on behalf of China and wish the Great East Asia War victory.</p>

Both Sides Deploying Troops in the Medjez el Bab Area, British Forces Advancing South Towards Rommel's Line. <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) Yesterday, American forces fiercely attacked the Maktar Pass in Tunisia, aiming to occupy it, but were thwarted by elite German troops and heavily bombed by the German air force, resulting in a devastating defeat and retreat. Before the attack, the American forces bombarded heavily for years, and then infantry launched fierce attacks on the German positions from both sides. However, the German troops fought bravely, halting the American offensive and then applying pressure to the attackers. The German air force joined the battle at this time, and the outcome was decided. Fast German fighter-bombers and dive bombers launched fierce attacks on the attacking American forces. A squadron of American tanks used for the assault was bombed. Military reports indicate that thirteen of them were completely destroyed by German aircraft and flat-trajectory guns, and the rest retreated east of the pass, mired in mud and unable to move.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to news from the Tunisian front, there has been no large-scale fighting on the northern and central fronts recently. Currently, the fighting is concentrated on the southern front and the Maktar-El Guettar area. American forces in that area are trying to advance eastward, but the Axis forces are preventing them, leading to fierce battles. The American forces are pressing towards Gabès from El Guettar, attempting to threaten the Axis forces' rear. However, due to the rugged terrain and muddy roads, many tanks cannot perform effectively. The remaining enemy troops have suffered great damage due to heavy Axis artillery fire. The German troops suffered heavy casualties in the northern hilly area of Doukebelda and have been repelled by the Axis forces. In the Utelef area north of Gabès, only artillery battles have occurred between the two sides. The anti-Axis forces on the northern front are attacking Djebel Gfifa between Sedjenane and Mateur, but there is no large-scale fighting. German troops in the Medjez el Bab area are reorganizing their forces, and it seems that there are large supplies from the rear. It is observed that there will be fierce battles in this area soon.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) The British forces in the Medjez el Bab area of Tunisia have now completed their redeployment. Military personnel here generally expect that the war will restart in that area. According to reports from reconnaissance units, the British 1st Infantry Division has now joined this section of the front. Given the recent reactivation of the British 1st Artillery, it is widely expected that the land war in the Medjez el Bab area will soon resume. Furthermore, British forces in the southern war zone of Tunisia have cleared the minefields and moved forward, closer to the Rommel line.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to German sources, German operations in the Izyum, south of Lake Ilmen, and Kuban River areas are progressing smoothly. The initiative of German operations on the Eastern Front is becoming increasingly strong. Combined with frontline news received here, it is said that German forces operating in the southwestern region of the Eastern Front are about to launch a major offensive, and the time seems imminent. According to information from Soviet sources received by Reuters' Moscow correspondent, the German army intends to launch a new offensive in the southern region and is urgently mobilizing large armies to concentrate there. A Pravda correspondent's report from Ukraine also stated that large German forces are continuing to move towards the southwestern front. Furthermore, Moscow newspapers have also published articles emphasizing the increasing urgency of the German offensive and urging the people to immediately awaken, exert all their strength, and resist the new German offensive.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) Military circles stated tonight that German forces, after penetrating Soviet lines in attacks yesterday, have gained control in three major areas of the Eastern Front: Izyum, Lake Ilmen, and the Kuban bridgehead. German forces in the Izyum area are now engaged in eliminating the last two Soviet bridgeheads on the Donets River. After two days of fierce fighting, German mechanized and grenadier units have cleared a large area in the Izyum-Donets River bend, allowing German forces to cross the Donets River and attack the center of the Soviet forces preparing for a counterattack. The center of the Donets line originally turned back east in that area, but after this operation, it has been re-extended. Military sources stated that German forces south of Ilmen have also advanced. German forces near Staraya Russa have repelled attacking Soviet forces and pursued them deep into Soviet lines. German and Romanian forces continue to hold the shortened front line of the Kuban bridgehead. Soviet forces launched large-scale attacks in the Kuban River basin and along the Sea of Azov. The northern bank of the Kuban River is defended by German troops. The Soviet forces attacked five times along the river but were all blocked by the German troops.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Tojo's Address at the Sino-Japanese Economic Roundtable Conference</p>
<p>The promotion of economic cooperation between China and Japan is a matter of utmost urgency that cannot be delayed. It is essential for China and Japan to join hands in establishing the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In light of this, the Japanese government held a roundtable conference on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation at the Prime Minister's official residence at 9:00 a.m. on February 29th.</p>
<p>The Japanese government was represented by Prime Minister Tojo, Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki, Vice-Minister for Greater East Asia Yamamoto, and Directors of the Army and Navy Affairs Bureaus Sato and Oka. The private sector was represented by the five major business leaders in Sino-Japanese relations and other representatives.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting, Prime Minister Tojo and Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki delivered speeches (details of which are provided separately below), followed by an immediate discussion. The attendees were all authorities in their respective fields, and they provided detailed and proactive opinions on specific measures for Sino-Japanese cooperation based on their extensive experience and ardent patriotism.</p>
<p>Summary of the Prime Minister's Address:</p>
<p>On this occasion, I would like to express my deep respect for your contributions and hard work over the years in the complex Sino-Japanese economic relationship. The National Government, standing on the basis of shared hardship, has further strengthened its determination to share life and death, declared war on Britain and the United States, and demonstrated its commitment to advancing along the same path as Japan to complete the war. Taking the National Government's participation in the war as an opportunity, the Japanese government intends to take this opportunity to re-examine the economic relations and make fair and reasonable adjustments to the existing economic facilities.</p>
<p>The government's top priority is to thoroughly implement the policies decided this time. During my previous visit to China, Japanese officials and civilians there all deeply understood the government's policies and showed extraordinary enthusiasm. I am very pleased with this situation. However, I would like to see even greater results, that is, that the public, especially the Japanese financial circles that directly or indirectly manage businesses or participate in economic activities in China, should fully understand the government's intentions and assist the government, which is the most necessary and effective thing to do.</p>
<p>Today is no longer a time to argue over rights or interests. Instead, we should join hands with the Chinese people, cooperate with them, and seek economic development from the standpoint of coexistence and co-prosperity. This is what I hope for from everyone present today. I hope that everyone present today will fully understand the government's policies outlined earlier and ensure that everyone involved locally thoroughly understands this intent in order to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>In this extraordinary autumn of the Great War, we must face it with extraordinary determination. Please understand the government's will and provide special cooperation. I earnestly hope for this.</p>
<p>Address by Minister Aoki for Greater East Asia</p>
<p>(1) In the past, economic activities in China had to be painstakingly managed to counter the anti-Japanese movement, and they also had to counter the British and American forces that used the concessions as strongholds to restrain and obstruct Japanese economic activities. Furthermore, since the China Incident, special economic activities have been necessary to meet Japan's operational needs. For these reasons, Japanese economic activities have often been managed based on privileges or rights and interests, resulting in a sense of antagonism between Japanese and Chinese businesses. This tendency certainly existed. However, due to the outbreak of war with Britain and the United States, the largest competitors in China, the British and American forces, have been completely removed. Moreover, the National Government and the Chinese people have now shown a comprehensive attitude of trust and cooperation. Therefore, today we must completely abandon the concept of antagonism or international rights and interests and promote friendly economies based on Sino-Japanese equality. However, it is certainly not easy for businesses that have been operating in China for a long time to change their long-standing habits along the lines of national policy. I especially hope that everyone will provide guidance and encouragement in this regard.</p>
<p>(2) After the establishment of new relations between China and Japan, the Japanese businesses that have been operating in China will not be forced to withdraw or dissolve, except for special cases. However, with regard to businesses that are managed and controlled by the Japanese side for special reasons during the Incident, it is natural that appropriate adjustments should be made according to the new policies and the nature of the business. Furthermore, changes in management personnel may also be anticipated as assets are transferred. In short, as mentioned above, we should get rid of old habits and aim to realize genuine Sino-Japanese cooperation from a standpoint of equality.

<h3 id="e23">Impressions of the Capital <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Hanru</p>
<p>The Chairman's speech was concise and clear, and his attitude was sincere. He was kind and compassionate in the ceremony. His words moved everyone's heartstrings, causing people to feel respect involuntarily. The commemorative ritual lasted an hour and ended with the entire assembly enthusiastically chanting "Long live the Republic of China," marking a historically significant moment.</p>
<p>At 10:30 a.m., the Chairman walked into the center of the restaurant entrance, chatting with General Hata as he walked. Following them were Foreign Minister Chu and Minister Lin, accompanied by Ambassador Shigemitsu, the Italian Ambassador, the German Chargé d'affaires, and other foreign envoys, as well as officers from the army, navy, and air force. They entered slowly to the sound of music. Shaoxing wine and champagne filled the glasses. The sound of clinking glasses and congratulations, combined with the aroma of wine, filled the air, filling the entire hall. Diplomatic relations would become even closer from this point on.</p>
<p>At 11:30 a.m., another scene unfolded in front of the National Assembly Hall. This was the beginning of the military parade. The Chairman, dressed in his Grand Marshal's uniform, appeared on the temporary parade stand. The "Grand Marshal Flag Escort Team," holding the large flag, stood upright beside him, dignified and solemn, which was awe-inspiring. Row after row of patriotic warriors saluted and marched past the Chairman until 12:00 p.m., when the grand ceremony ended. The morning's celebrations came to a temporary conclusion at this point.</p>
<p>In commemoration of the return of the capital, this newspaper specially sent 1,000 copies to Beijing on the 30th to be distributed to various sectors. At around 4:00 p.m. today, the reporter transported the newspapers to National Central University, where the Shanghai football teams were putting on a friendship match. The football field was packed with fans from the capital. Taking advantage of the break, the reporter distributed the newspapers from all four corners of the field. In no time, the newspapers were snatched up. The people of Nanjing had been separated from this newspaper for a long time, and some even asked the reporter if this newspaper was still being published. Their affection for this newspaper moved the reporter greatly.</p>
<p>While in Beijing, I visited fellow journalists, including the president of the Republic of China Daily News, the president of the China Daily News, and various members of the Central News Agency, as well as reporters from the North China Journalists Association and Mr. Irie from the Domei News Agency. I am grateful for their warm hospitality and the exchange of ideas. We all felt that the communication among journalists is insufficient at present. For example, it is not easy to see the Shen Bao in Beijing, Nanjing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, and it is also difficult to find newspapers from the aforementioned places in Shanghai. In this turbulent era, the exchange of Chinese and foreign cultures is still needed, and the mouthpiece of the domestic people—the newspaper—should be clear first. Regarding this point, we all believe that journalists should work hard to resolve this difficulty.</p>
<p>The cost of living in Nanjing is generally lower than in Shanghai. I cannot give examples of prices here, but just taking rice as an example, the black market price of rice in Shanghai is now twice as high as in Nanjing. Also, for example, if you go to the Confucius Temple to eat a bowl of pork noodles, half a basket of six large steamed buns, and a small bowl of dried bean curd shreds, you can't say that that's "cheap," can you? In Shanghai, it would cost more than 25 yuan, but in Nanjing, 12 or 13 yuan would be enough.

<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) It was announced here this evening that the German government has decided to move former French Prime Ministers Daladier, Blum, and General Gamelin, the commander-in-chief of the French forces in the 1940 war against Germany, to Germany in order to avoid British and American plans to seize these individuals. The original text of the German government's announcement is as follows: "Based on the information it has received, the German government has determined that the British and American governments intend to seize several French figures who have always been in France in the hope of using them to establish an opposition government to cause unrest and chaos in France. Therefore, the German government has decided, following the precedent of former French cabinet members Reynaud and Mandel, to move former French Prime Ministers Daladier, Blum, and General Gamelin to Germany. For the reasons stated above, the German government cannot comply with the request of French Head of State Laval to allow these individuals to remain in France. However, the German government assures the French government that the military necessity of moving these individuals will not cause them any harm, nor will it change their treatment by the French government. The German government will return these individuals to the French government for disposal when circumstances permit."</p>

<p>Vichy, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) When anti-Axis aircraft attacked Paris today, it was during the first races of the spring horse racing season at the famous Longchamp Racecourse, resulting in at least thirty deaths and numerous injuries, making it impossible to make an accurate estimate. The bombers appeared over Paris at around 2:00 p.m. today, just as the first race was about to begin. The bombers dropped bombs from high altitude, many of which landed near the racecourse. The spectators fled in panic, trampling each other. The cries of women mixed with the sound of anti-aircraft guns. Order was restored after an hour. Thirty people died, and many more were seriously injured.</p>

<h3 id="e29">New Trends in the European Economic System <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The durability of the Soviet Union has now been proven by facts and cannot be underestimated. Therefore, Britain and the United States are concentrating their efforts on disrupting Europe, viewing it as the key to determining the outcome of the war. On the Axis side, resistance activities have also become increasingly active recently, with the domestic situation extremely tense and the entire war system completed. In order to counter the Anglo-American system, how should this new system of Europe-wide total war be strengthened to adapt to the current emergency situation? In order to understand the international interrelationships of the European economy that form the basis of the broad economic warfare system, reporters (Wakayama, Yamamoto, special correspondents) interviewed Mr. Jakobsson of the Basel Bank for International Settlements and two or three influential international economic experts, and exchanged opinions with them. Of course, the position of neutral countries is now quite delicate. While some arguments are quite correct, there are also many prejudices. The content of the conversations was very interesting.</p>
<p>Jakobsson is a Swede and an advisor to the Bank for International Settlements. He is the editor of the Bank for International Settlements' annual report and an expert familiar with international economics. At the same time, he is a financier widely watched. Before Sir Otto Niemeyer of the Bank of England went to China to reform the currency system, he was once recruited by Japan, but the matter did not come to fruition, and he still misses it. His understanding of Japan's position is quite fair.</p>
<p>The other gentlemen are also international economic experts, but they cannot escape the influence of long-term free economic thought, harboring the illusion that a free economy is still possible in the future, and rarely understand the inevitable evolution of history.</p>
<p>The first question: "Regardless of whether European countries are willing, in order to counter the communization of the Soviet Union and the economic blockade of Britain and the United States, should they have closer cooperation with Germany and Italy in the future?" On this point, no clear conclusion was reached. The interviewees believed this to be a matter of the European people's trust in Germany, while the reporters took the position solely from the perspective of the real material foundation.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States have been using post-war tactics to instigate and disrupt Europe for a long time because they do not have the strength to defeat Germany and Italy. Recent news magazines talk lavishly about post-war issues, which are clearly exaggerated and fabricated propaganda. Although Germany and Italy inevitably face many difficulties, they undoubtedly want to link European countries together.</p>
<p>Speaking of the current status of clearing agreements. The clearing agreement was initially regarded as a countermeasure to resolve the freezing of assets with Germany, and was started after negotiations between Germany and the opposing countries. To date, it has been expanding daily. Except for Spain, Portugal, and Turkey, 17 European countries are interconnected through Berlin based on multilateral clearing agreements. This is a technical foundation that constitutes the European total war system. On the other hand, despite the many difficulties in wartime today, the biggest problem is that European countries export more to Germany than they import from Germany, resulting in an increase in claims against Germany.</p>
<p>Some people view the increase in claims against Germany as a pessimistic reason for the future of the clearing agreement. Germany explains this as "the nature of claims against Germany is like long-term wartime savings stored in Germany, which will be gradually supplied and repaid by Germany in the form of goods after the war." Therefore, the increase in claims against Germany is not a reason for pessimism. In the future, these claims will enable European countries to cooperate more closely with Germany and Italy in order to win the material foundation of the Europe-wide total war.</p>
<p>The next question is, "After the claims against Germany reach a considerable amount, due to advance payments, European countries will inevitably issue more inconvertible paper money and cause inflation. What are your opinions on this?"</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of inflation, everyone unanimously held an optimistic view, believing that the situation that occurred after the last war would not be seen again for the time being. The reasons are:</p>
<p>First, the completeness of the economic control organization;</p>
<p>Second, everyone has considerable knowledge of the consequences of malignant inflation;</p>
<p>Third, the dominance of capital has been suppressed.</p>
<p>That is, the power of politics over organized economic activities is far greater than it was in the last war. The expansion of social facilities has stabilized the rear life, and at the same time, controlling prices and reducing bank interest rates have made it impossible for capital to reap excessive profits. Furthermore, the method of raising war funds also strives to suppress the outdated method of relying on public debt and absorbs surplus purchasing power. Therefore, all countries have successively increased taxes, and the percentage of war expenses borne by taxes in each country has significantly increased compared to the last war. Considering these things, at least inflation similar to that after the last war will not occur. Many powerful opinions believe that gold will still play a considerable role after the war, but there will be considerable changes depending on the US gold policy. Many other issues were also discussed. In short, emotional issues have obscured the eyes of judging reality, and there is no firm awareness of the inevitable trends in the future. This is the impression gained by the reporters.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the reporters also saw the reality of the situation, ruthlessly overturning the above ideas. Why can't the agricultural Balkan countries not produce a certain amount of food? Why can't neutral Switzerland not cultivate gardens on the mountains and dismantle the flowers and plants in the parks to plant potatoes? In short, the characteristic of this war is that the burden of sacrifices in the war is not borne by a certain part but by a broad layer of the entire population, and whether they are willing or not, it is shared jointly by the national layers of several countries. Regarding this point, a certain person said, "Whether it is the US Lend-Lease Act or the issue of increasing claims against Germany through the European clearing agreement, they all prove that this war is an activity of a broad total war." Because the purpose and hopes of the war are very great, the methods of war, even in the participating countries, cannot but be different, and therefore the one-sided flow of materials cannot but be stopped. The sacrifices of this war cannot be borne by only one country, but must be borne jointly by several countries. No one can be indifferent to the war, and even a small country in Europe cannot go beyond the European war circle.

<p>Special Ration Sugar Rotation Review</p>
<p>As for the special ration sugar for self-use by various industries last month, the review has already started. However, because there are more than 10,000 rationed households, it has not been possible to complete it all at once, so a rotation system has been adopted, reviewing them one by one in order. Those that are completed first are issued first. Notification slips have now been issued for a portion, which can be exchanged for sugar purchase certificates to buy sugar from designated Class B sugar merchants. The price is the same as the previous period, at five yuan, five jiao, and five fen per catty, plus two li for the Public Concession Bureau donation. Another portion is also being reviewed and will be issued within days to process the procedures for exchanging certificates and purchasing sugar.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Yesterday, All Sectors of the City Held a Confucius Ceremony <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The city's Spring Sacrificial Ceremony was held solemnly yesterday morning at the Confucius Temple in the Southern City. Mr. Zhao Zunyue, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, represented Mayor Chen Gongbo as the chief officiant. The ceremony was simple and solemn. It is estimated that no fewer than a thousand people, including officials from various districts of the city, principals of various primary and secondary schools, and male and female students, attended.</p>
<p>The situation was extremely grand. In addition to armed police guarding inside and outside the Confucius Temple, the Boy Scouts of the Second Municipal Middle School maintained order. A red silk banner was hung high in front of the Dacheng Hall, with the words "Spring Confucius Ceremony in Shanghai Special City" written on it. Candles were lit brightly in the hall, and incense smoke filled the air. A bunch of incense and flowers were offered in front of the Great Accomplishment Sage Teacher and various holy positions, and the atmosphere was especially solemn.</p>
<p>Sacrificial Text for Confucius</p>
<p>The Confucius sacrificial text yesterday read: "We, in the thirty-second year of the Republic of China, on the fifth day of the fourth month of the year Guiwei, Chen Gongbo, Mayor of Shanghai Special City, together with officials, respectfully offer flowers and clear wine to the Great Accomplishment Sage Teacher Confucius, saying, 'Only the Teacher, whose laws have flourished for thousands of years, crowning a hundred kings, brought together the great accomplishment of sacred learning, which has never been seen by the people. First in loyalty and forgiveness, the sage harmonized with the mean, opening up thousands of years of culture with the tinder of sixteen characters. Pi Yong's bells and drums overflowed with harmonious sounds, and the elegant songs of Sheng Zhao brightened the grand ceremony. Now, at the Spring Festival, we piously prepare rituals, and lead our colleagues to offer our admiration. The spring breeze is warm, like the Teacher's kindness in nurturing, and the rain knows the time, offering the praise of harmony. We respectfully follow the sacrificial rites, with the Second Sage, the Returning Sage, the Narrating Sage, and the Zong Sage as companions,'" and so on.</p>
<p>Chief Officiant's Dedication</p>
<p>The chief officiant, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Zhao Zunyue's dedication said, "The Teacher's teachings are immortal for thousands of years. The flourishing of our country's culture and education is based on the Teacher's teachings. The so-called cultural spirit of Greater East Asia is actually the teachings of Confucius. Cultivating oneself, managing the family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world. Everything from the personal conduct of individuals to the entire national governance is fully instructed to future generations without any omissions. The personal conduct of individuals should not violate the Doctrine of the Mean. Speaking with loyalty and trustworthiness, and acting with sincerity and respect, are especially good precepts for future generations. Therefore, Confucius's learning contains everything. For thousands of years, the culture of East Asia has been passed down forever. The National Government's policy after returning to the capital is based on this, and restoring the spring and autumn sacrifices is not just a model for respecting the Confucian community and remembering the teachers and sages. It is used as a dedication," and so on.</p>
<p>Confucius Sage Society</p>
<p>On April 5th, the Qingming Festival, coinciding with the clear weather of Shangsi, the Chinese Confucius Sage Society held a grand Confucius ceremony at its clubhouse on Avenue Edward VII. Preparations had been made the night before, with offerings of sacrificial vessels, silk, incense, and fresh flowers arranged in front of the statues, which were extremely solemn and splendid. More than a hundred people attended, all dressed in blue robes and black jackets, behaving elegantly. The chief officiant was Chairman Tang and Chairman Shen, and the accompanying officiants were Vice Chairmen Feng and Shen. The announcer called for everyone to stand up straight and sing the national anthem and the song of honoring Confucius. The national anthem was the Three Principles of the People, and the song of honoring Confucius was "Confucius, Confucius, the Great Confucius, before Confucius, there was no Confucius, after Confucius, there is no Confucius, Confucius, Confucius, the Great Confucius." After everyone finished singing, the ritual of offering began: (1) Bowing deeply to the statue of the sage, three bows, (2) Silence, (3) Offering incense, offering wine, offering flowers, (4) Reading the prayer, which reads, "We, Shen Enzi and others, disciples of the Chinese Confucius Sage Society of Jiangsu Province, Shanghai County, respectfully offer sacrifices to the Holy Teacher Confucius, saying, 'Our Teacher, whose virtue is superior to the thousand sages and whose teachings crown the hundred kings, reveals the sun and moon as always, and is unprecedented among the people. Belonging to the memory of the River Horse carrying the map, we cherish the auspicious unicorn spitting out jade. The palace walls are beautiful, and after generations, the scenery is renewed. The position of nurturing and harmony traces its fame and reaches far and wide. Spreading longevity and the transformation of people, the Jun Mao are all respectful, recommending fragrant incense, presenting the categories of Yi Lun's order, and the etiquette is more elaborate, stricter than the Bian Dou. Happily meeting Shangsi, we respectfully follow Yi Zhang, solemnly displaying our humble sincerity, and respectfully carry out the sacrificial rites, may you enjoy the offerings,'" (5) Performing the ritual of burning the prayer, (6) The ceremony is completed, Qin Qin.</p>
<h3 id="e32">After the Implementation of the New System for the Movement of Materials, Ships Operating on the Yangtze River are being Reorganized. Existing Vessels are being Fully Utilized.

<p>After the implementation of the new system for the movement of materials, the transportation of materials between the inland and the city will become busy. The city's shipping company authorities believe that it is necessary to adjust this situation in order to increase the city's production. The city's China Shipping Company authorities have already considered this point and will make full use of the existing vessels operating on the Yangtze River. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, most of the city's transportation companies have a large amount of goods waiting to be transported for export. Therefore, they are paying close attention to the shipping company's adjustment of shipping and hope that it can strengthen the transportation capacity of the ships. According to general speculation, since there are many types of material movements in the city that are not subject to control, if the transportation capacity of the shipping companies is further strengthened, the city's declining transportation industry can be improved slightly.</p>

The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Unanimous Participation from All Sectors of Nanshi</p>

At the same time, Mr. Sugiama and Mr. Kenichi Furukawa of the Nanshi Gendarmerie also attended, totaling more than 500 people.</p>
<p>General Corps Commander's Opening Remarks</p>
<p>After the ceremony, General Corps Commander Wang Delin gave the opening remarks, briefly saying that since the implementation of the Baojia system, local security has been increasingly consolidated. Recently, the Municipal Baojia Committee has been established, and under the guidance of Director Lu, it will be even more complete. The Bao Chiefs are the leaders of the residents and should especially lead by example and be fair, honest, sincere, and diligent in their work. The Nanshi Baojia Self-Defense Corps was established on June 15th last year. Because of the close cooperation between the police and the Baojia, the achievements of the Self-Defense Corps have been outstanding and have been repeatedly praised by Director Lu Ying of the Municipal Police Bureau. It is the responsibility of the squad leaders to supervise and command, so the squad leaders should bear the direct responsibility for whether the Self-Defense Corps can fully exert its responsibilities. From now on, everyone should recognize their responsibilities, earnestly carry them out, and enable every member of the Nanshi Self-Defense Corps to exert their abilities and increase the strength of the police corps.</p>
<p>Allied Official's Remarks</p>
<p>Following this, Mr. Sugiama, Commander of the Nanshi Gendarmerie, gave a speech, saying that the cooperation between the Gendarmerie and the Municipal Police Authority promotes the improvement of local security, and the Baojia Self-Defense Corps should also closely connect with the Gendarmerie and the Police Bureau to make local security more complete and to reach the stage where nothing is picked up on the road, and the people can live and work in peace. I hope that all Bao Chiefs, Lianbao Chiefs, and Jia Chiefs will earnestly carry this out.</p>
<p>Two Branch Corps Commanders Speaking in Succession</p>
<p>Subsequently, Self-Defense Corps Branch Commanders Jiang Ziyun and Wang Baosui stood up and gave speeches one after another. Jiang said, "The Baojia cannot be separated from the Self-Defense Corps. The soundness of the Self-Defense Corps is of great importance to the security of the entire area. The duty of the Self-Defense Corps is to maintain local security with local forces." Wang Baosui's speech said, "The meeting held today is of great significance, because it allows the corps' actions to be clearly understood by all members without any alienation. There are more than 500 Self-Defense Corps posts in Nanshi, divided into three shifts, mobilizing more than 1,500 people every day to maintain local security, which can promote the escape of criminals, but all members must not be perfunctory, and all Baojia Chiefs should constantly warn everyone," and so on. At the end, General Corps Commander Wang Delin gave a reply, and then the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Noodle Food Industry Association, jointly organized by the machine-made cut noodle industry, the fried cooked food industry, the cake and steamed bread industry, and the cake, noodle, and fried dough stick industry, will soon be one month old since its establishment. It has been making every effort to negotiate with the authorities to restore the allocation of flour and has had some hope. However, many members in each group are found to be duplicates. Because there were originally associations in each industry and one store joined several associations, it is very inconvenient for reporting procedures and allocation matters. With the permission of the Shanghai Municipal Council Association Section and the decision of the association's board of directors and supervisors, a general registration will be held from today (6th) to the 9th in order to adjust and serve as the standard for flour allocation. Therefore, within the above-mentioned period, members of each group must bring their spring business license, flour card, citizen certificate, brand name, seal, and private seal, and the manager must personally go to the Jueyuan Buddhist Temple at No. 418 Chide Road, identify the nature of the business, and register with each group. Applications will not be accepted after the deadline.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Special Feature: The New Chinese Navy - A Tour of the Hai Xiang and Hai Xing <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Hanruo</p>
<p>Since the return of the National Government to the capital, China's army, navy, and air force have been rebuilt with the assistance of Japan. The reconstruction of the new navy is like a new spring bud growing.</p>
<p>The gunboat Hai Xiang of the Weihaiwei naval base and the training ship Hai Xing of Shanghai, in order to participate in the celebration of the return to the capital, sailed from their respective defense zones to Nanjing, were inspected by Chairman Wang, and after completing their mission, recently sailed to Shanghai and were anchored at the Bund wharf on Nanjing Road. This reporter, in order to see the face of this new Chinese navy, made a special trip for a brief inquiry.</p>
<p>Under the national emblem, the white cross Chinese naval flag fluttered on the Huangpu River. The two warships were quietly berthed alongside the ship. Because the Chinese navy does not often appear on the Huangpu River, many people on the shore were casting curious glances at them. Naturally, the size of the Hai Xiang and Hai Xing ships cannot be compared with the large warships of other countries anchored in the heart of the river. However, let me tell you: these are just training ships and river defense gunboats!</p>
<p>On the Hai Xiang, because the captain had gone ashore on official business, I only met the deputy captain, Major Li Jikang, a robust figure and handsome in appearance, a young man who spoke very gently. Major Li told the reporter everything about the Hai Xiang:</p>
<p>"The Hai Xiang is a gunboat of 865 tons, 200 feet long, with a normal sailing speed of 10 nautical miles, and a full speed of 13 nautical miles. It is equipped with two cannons and two new-style anti-aircraft machine guns. The entire ship has 20 officers, 100 soldiers, and 20 naval academy cadets. The Hai Xiang is one of the Weihaiwei fortress base fleet. It was handed over to our country by Japan in August of the 30th year (1941). The captain is Mr. Ma Yunsheng."</p>
<p>Everywhere on the ship was clean and orderly, and the soldiers were full of vigor. White uniforms with the "Republic of China Navy" cap badge were floating everywhere. This is the future "China belt and sash, golden soup of East Asia"!</p>
<p>After visiting the Hai Xiang, Deputy Captain Li accompanied the reporter to visit the Hai Xing. Under the leadership of Deputy Captain Chen Lianke, another tour of the Hai Xing was conducted. According to Deputy Captain Chen, "Except for the stern of the Hai Xing being slightly higher than the Hai Xiang, everything else is largely the same. She was built in England in the 17th year of the Republic (1928) and is now used as a training ship for the Shanghai Naval Academy." On the deck, I saw many people using binoculars or diligently inspecting the machinery, presumably naval students practicing.</p>
<p>After inspecting the two ships, we returned to the shore. Seeing our naval flag fluttering in the wind on the bank of the Huangpu River, I couldn't help but silently wish the new Chinese navy a bright future!</p>

<p>The Central China Tobacco Allocation Association Implements Uniform Distribution: The first batch of goods was distributed on the 25th of last month. The next distribution is expected to be around the 10th of this month. The allocation includes Nanyang, Datong, and other cigarettes. As for the method for Chinese merchants, it remains the same as the previous period. The goods can only be shipped after notification from the association.</p>
<p>The Central Market firewood and charcoal cooperative in this city has a total capital of 6 million yuan, with 3 million yuan collected first. The previous rumor of a capital of 600,000 yuan, with 300,000 yuan collected first, is inaccurate.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Commentary: Stabilizing Prices Lies in Unblocking Raw Material Sources <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Stabilizing prices lies in increasing production. To increase productivity, the first step is to unblock raw material sources. Currently, foreign raw materials are unavailable. However, domestic agricultural and mineral products can serve as raw materials for industrial products and can replace foreign raw materials. If transportation infrastructure can be improved and transportation efficiency increased, agricultural raw materials from various inland areas can be transported to industrial areas as much as possible, such as Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanjing. Then, manufactured goods from factories can be transported to inland areas as much as possible, implementing a barter system. In this way, raw material sources will be unblocked, and prices will naturally stabilize. Because costs are reduced, all prices can naturally fall. Not only in Central China, but also between North and Central China, and between Central and South China, if each region actively trades its local specialties, adhering to the principle of material exchange, prices in various regions can be uniformly stabilized. The public's fear of material shortages can also be eliminated invisibly. Therefore, in addition to using political power to control prices, it is also necessary to unblock material sources. It is essential to improve transportation infrastructure, increase the amount of raw materials available daily, and consistently improve factory productivity. Then, supply and demand will be balanced, materials will circulate, and the most difficult price problem can be easily solved.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Deputy Minister Chen of the Ministry of Finance Discusses: Our Country's Wartime Finance is Solid, the People Have the Ability to Bear Taxes, and Inflation Will Absolutely Not Occur <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency): Since the National Government officially entered the war, our country's wartime system has gradually been established, and the economic and financial system has also gradually become consolidated. This reporter visited Deputy Minister Chen Zhishuo of the Ministry of Finance yesterday to inquire about recent financial and economic issues of the National Government. He kindly answered them one by one as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What are the characteristics of our country's wartime finance?</p>
<p>Answer: The characteristics of our country's wartime finance must first be grasped. Our government is now cooperating in the Greater East Asia War and implementing participation in the war. The current focus of finance is to increase production. There are various types of increased production industries, especially "turning the scattered into the integrated and turning the non-existent into the existent" is the most important. All material and human resources scattered throughout the country must be concentrated to contribute to the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Question: Are special wartime taxes currently being implemented?</p>
<p>Answer: There is no special tax collection at present. There is no need for special taxes at present.</p>
<p>Question: What is the current capacity of the domestic population to bear taxes?</p>
<p>Answer: The public not only has the ability to bear the current taxes, but also has a deep understanding of taxes, which is a good phenomenon. Even if taxes are increased, it is believed that the general public will be able to recognize the goal, assist the government in completing the great cause, and will not feel any pain.</p>
<p>Question: After the friendly nation Japan stopped issuing military scrip in various parts of China, it has had a significant impact on the future of our country's currency system. What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Answer: Since the return of the National Government to the capital, the Central Reserve Bank was first established and granted the right to issue currency to unify the currency system and lay the foundation for finance. Over the past three years, the right to issue Hwa Hsing Notes was first abolished, then the equal circulation of Central Reserve Notes and old legal tender was abolished, and then the legal tender nature of the old legal tender was abolished, eventually eliminating the old legal tender, so that the Central Reserve Note is the only currency in the peaceful areas. Regarding military scrip, the friendly nation Japan, in order to assist our country in completing the unified currency policy, has stopped the new issuance of military scrip and the cancellation of old legal tender from April 1, which is no different in meaning. The only difference is that the method of withdrawal is one of decisive action and the other of natural trend.</p>
<p>Question: Can our country avoid the occurrence of inflation?</p>
<p>Answer: The current issuance of Central Reserve Notes is only over 2 billion, which is still far from the needs of various regions. Those who are ignorant of the principles of economics and finance are concerned about inflation due to rising prices, but they do not know that the Central Reserve Note currently holds more than 60% of reserve funds. Whether now or in the future, there will absolutely not be inflation.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Minister Gu of the Ministry of Food Explains the Organization of Cooperative Societies <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai (Central News Agency): Minister of Food Gu Baoheng has been in Shanghai for several days to promote the food control issue, contacting leaders of various industries in the city and providing guidance. This reporter visited Mr. Gu yesterday (the 5th) to inquire about the organizational issues of the controlled food cooperative societies. He kindly made the following statement: The organizational rules for the Ministry of Food's controlled food cooperative societies, published in the Beijing and Shanghai newspapers on the 1st of this month, were originally a draft for research purposes and were not announced or implemented. Since the National Government officially promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Business Guilds, this proposal has become a thing of the past. Except for rice merchants (rice and glutinous rice), who still organize local rice purchase and sales management offices under special laws, other food industries such as flour, miscellaneous grains, sugar, eggs, tea, and livestock should organize trade guilds under the guidance and supervision of the Ministry of Food's Food Bureau and the county and municipal government's competent authorities. The traders in each industry should organize trade guilds, and the local trade guilds should form a joint federation. The various trade federations should jointly form a commercial control federation (excluding foreign trade industries for the time being) to complete a highly autonomous control mechanism. The trade guilds and federations of each lower-level organization are directly governed by the commercial control federation. The commercial control federation oversees everything, and the Ministry of Food fulfills its guidance and supervisory duties for the food-related parts of the commercial control federation. Furthermore, the business categories under the jurisdiction of the Ministry mentioned in the newspapers on the 4th incorrectly listed flour as cotton. As for edible salt, it has special regulatory agencies due to tax relations, so it is not under the management of the Ministry of Food. There are also many other errors that cannot be listed. Please take the news reports of my speech at the reception for the directors and supervisors of the commercial control federation and the leaders of various industries on March 31 as the standard, so as to avoid the outside world being unaware of the truth and spreading misinformation.</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Municipal Bureau of Economy Started General Registration of Major Commodities Yesterday: Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth is Transferred by the Commercial Control Federation <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai (Central News Agency): In order to comply with the powers conferred by the Provisional Regulations and to implement the wartime economic policy and the task of material control guidance and supervision, as well as to handle the balanced distribution of materials fairly in the future, the Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Economy has launched a general registration of major materials in Shanghai Special Municipality, in order to formulate guidelines for promoting all wartime economic policies based on the statistical figures of this general registration. The measures for the bureau to handle the general registration of major items have been formulated and announced to the industries for their information. Registration will start on the 5th of this month and end on the 30th of this month. It is reported that in order to facilitate the registration of companies and shops in various industries, those who have registered with the National Commercial Control Federation for cotton yarn and cotton cloth will have their registration transferred by the Commercial Control Federation to the bureau without the need to register again. As for foreign shops or owners outside the respective trade guilds, they must apply to the bureau for registration. Those who resist or conceal, or underreport, will be severely punished once verified.</p>
<p>Major Item Registration Form</p>
<p>Since the bureau promulgated the general registration measures for major items in the city, it has been decided to start the registration process yesterday (the 5th). All shops or companies in various industries in the city must truthfully fill in the columns listed in the application form for major item registration and apply to the bureau for registration. (A) Applicants for registration: (1) Shop name, (2) Name of shop owner or manager, (3) Business address, (4) Telephone number (If privately owned, state the name, occupation, address, and telephone number of the owner). (B) Item type: (1) Item name, (2) Trademark, (3) Quantity, (4) Storage location, (5) Remarks.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Controlling the Prices of Daily Necessities Will Be Implemented Gradually <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the Public Works Department has decided to gradually implement price controls in order to curb the prices of various major daily necessities. New price controls have already been implemented for cigarettes, and retail stores have been strictly ordered to comply. Those who disobey secretly will be severely punished. Therefore, the authorities have dispatched a large number of investigators yesterday to investigate whether retailers are complying with the price controls on daily necessities. As for soap, matches, and candles, their prices are also under the travel control of the authorities, and limited prices will be announced soon. It is also heard that after the authorities have achieved results in controlling the prices of the above-mentioned daily necessities, they will expand the scope and organize a strict control system. This system may be unprecedented, but its effects will be even better. Once a strict control system is established, the prices of other daily necessities will be subject to its control, so that retailers, wholesalers, or manufacturers will be unable to seek illegal profits. As for residents, there will be no shortage of daily necessities for their personal use.</p>

<p>Changjiang Industry and Trade Association Holds Third Congress</p>
<p>At the Sino-Japanese Economic Roundtable held on the 30th of last month, Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia expressed his strong desire that Japanese businessmen involved in Chinese enterprises must promote friendly economic cooperation on the basis of Sino-Japanese equality. He hoped that the private sector would cooperate in this regard. In order to adapt to this new policy and solicit opinions from all parties to gather ideas, the Changjiang Industry and Trade Development Association specially held its third congress at the Tokyo Peerage Hall on the occasion of its third anniversary (April 2nd). Attendees included Xu Liang, former ambassador to Japan, the former 5th Director of the Planning Board, Counselor Tanaka of the Greater East Asia Ministry and the chiefs of various sections, Director Takei of the Accounting Bureau of the Navy Ministry, Director Lingnuma of the Price Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, President Tamura of the Japan Fisheries Co. from the private sector, as well as representatives from East Asia Shipping, Mitsubishi Trading, and banks and news agencies related to Central China, totaling more than 100 people. President Tamura delivered a speech first, followed by discussions on various issues, which yielded fruitful results. (From the Continental New Report on April 4th)</p>

<p>Utilizing Spare Time - Prisoners</p>
<p>The extent of a young person's future achievements can be determined by how they utilize their fragmented spare time. Those who constantly complain and think, "I have no time," truly seem to have no spare time. However, those who steal time from being busy, their ambition will be there, and time will be there, because no one can absolutely not find spare time and time, unless they use spare time for improper things, or doze off. Therefore, those who can utilize space can help them succeed, and those who cannot utilize space instead use their spare time to do things that are harmful to their body and mind, and find a path of degradation for themselves.</p>
<p>We often wonder why many friends of our fathers and brothers have not attended any schools and are mostly "apprentices" by origin, but they read a lot of books and write beautiful calligraphy... What is the reason for this? This is all the reward they get from using their spare time. Frankly speaking, "We are now no matter how busy, not as busy as they were when they were 'apprentices'! But they say that it is always possible to steal a little time from being busy to read a few pages and write a few words," so what about us?</p>
<p>You might as well ask yourself, "Where have our precious spare time gone? Has it been used entirely for proper purposes?"</p>
<p>Scientific Essays - "Cancer" Peng Liu</p>
<p>Picking up the pen, I can't help but think of three "worries": the danger of cancer is indeed terrible; that terrible cancer can be treated with a kind of light is also strange; that in today's scientifically advanced world, common knowledge of cancer is not very popular in China, I can't help but feel sorry.</p>
<p>Speaking of cancer, it is truly terrible. Those who suffer from this disease will be summoned to heaven in a few months to a few years. The so-called pain is caused by the abnormal transformation of cells in a certain part of the body, which grows abnormally. It can occur in any part of the body. The so-called abnormal growth means that it does not exist in normal situations and common diseases. The differentiation and growth of this cell is unbelievably rapid, like the saying "growing day by day." Since the cells are growing so rapidly, they need abundant nutrition. Therefore, the nutrients needed by all parts of the body are plundered by them, resulting in extreme weakness of the patient. Moreover, these cells are different from normal cells: even if the body's nutrition is close to exhaustion, they still stubbornly do their best to exploit and extract until death. However, the horror of cancer is not only this. During the growth period, cancer grows outward non-stop on the one hand, and penetrates into the internal tissues on the other hand, just like the roots of underground trees, spreading branches in all directions without a definite range. If you want to cut it out, you can't cut it all out, and when it penetrates and encounters any organ, it also pushes in, either growing firmly with the organ, or destroying and penetrating the organ and continuing to grow, causing the organ to lose its function. What's more, cancer cells also have the characteristic of migration, with a great "tendency to flee". When a certain part has cancer, it can soon occur in another part (for example, breast cancer can cause cancer under the armpit). Therefore, even if all methods are used to remove the cancer, it often recurs, "Wildfires cannot burn out the weeds, the spring breeze blows them back to life," this is truly the case. In the end, the body must ulcerate and rot miserably, and life ends here.</p>
<p>Such a terrible cancer, in theory, we should understand its cause and prevent it: unfortunately, although countless scientists have exhausted their efforts to study the cause of cancer, although several theories have been established, some think that it is due to changes in age (cancer mostly occurs in old age, and it can be said that there is no cancer in childhood) and changes in endocrine in the body, some say that it is because of excessive stimulation, and some even create other theories, but the exact cause is still not clear. Moreover, cancer does not seem to have the possibility of infecting people, so there is no way to prevent it at all, and it can only be treated after it has occurred.</p>
<p>The treatment of cancer, in the past, everyone believed that the method of surgical removal was not thorough, but fortunately, the French scientists, Mr. and Mrs. Curie, discovered radium, and cancer was considered to have a relatively satisfactory treatment. The latest method now is to use surgery, X-ray irradiation, and radium tablet irradiation together, which can achieve great results.</p>
<p>However, this method is only relatively satisfactory and not fully ideal, because several types of cancer (such as cancer of the cervix, breast, vulva, nasal cavity, etc.) can indeed be cured in the early stage, but in the late stage, there is no guarantee, at most it can only prolong life for several months. Moreover, there are several types of cancer (such as cancer of the esophagus, lung, stomach, intestine, etc.) that cannot be cured with this method even in the early stage. So, in the end, no matter how pitiful common sense of pain is, how strange light therapy is, cancer is still terrible after all.</p>
<p>Controlling Desire Zhang Xin</p>
<p>Humans are naturally endowed with a pair of eyes to see things, a pair of ears to hear things, and a brain to think about things. The changes in the world and the vicissitudes of human affairs can be seen if not heard. After seeing or hearing, the brain will think about the reasons behind them. Therefore, the times are a book without words, and life is a rich education. Even illiterate people cannot be said to have not learned or been trained. The myriad forms of the universe are projected on their eyes, strike their eardrums, and stimulate their nerves every day. They cannot help but feel, cannot remain indifferent, unless they are blind, deaf, and idiots.</p>
<p>Therefore, everyone understands some principles of being a person, such as the origin of success, the root of failure, how to be promising, and how to fall into depravity. You can't help but know what you see and hear. Then, shouldn't everyone cleverly abandon evil and pursue good? Why do some people still do evil? Is it said that they are forced by life and have no choice? Yes, this is the reason for thieves and the like. There are also many other people who have no worries about clothes, food, or shelter. Why do they also do things that harm others and benefit themselves? The only reason is that "desire" is at work. They are all confused by their insatiable desires and cannot control them.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is difficult to fill the sea of desire, and wanting more after getting something is originally a bad habit of human beings. We must control it, and then we can sacrifice ourselves for others and benefit society. If we let it go, it will harm others and benefit ourselves, and create disaster for society, like a horse without reins, once it starts, it cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>Careful thinking, careful action, and a simple life are the methods to control desire. Fire tests gold, and desire tests you. If you can control desire and not let it control you, you will see your greatness.</p>
<p>Sense of Responsibility Shi Yang</p>
<p>Most people probably have this feeling, that is, before something is done, they often feel worried, and after the thing is completed, they feel happy. Why do they worry before things are done? Because the things placed in front of them need to be done, which means that they have taken on the responsibility of this matter. Because they cannot escape this responsibility and cannot get help from others, they begin to feel uneasy in their hearts. They fear that the obstacles in the process will hinder their progress and cause their failure. But once things are successful, the joy at that time is indescribable, because the responsibility has been removed, and the big stone in their hearts has been put down. Moreover, in a struggle, they have gained a lot of experience, and when they encounter the same situation in the future, they have methods to deal with it, and there is no need to worry unnecessarily.</p>
<p>The more things you do, the easier it is to deal with, and you are also willing to take responsibility. This proves that your experience is sufficient, so you are not afraid of trouble. People who are inexperienced and have little experience in the world are often afraid of trouble and are unwilling to take responsibility. Therefore, when things come, they always try to escape and shirk responsibility.</p>
<p>Escape and shirk responsibility may solve the current difficulties, but the difficulties caused in the future will be greater. Their contact with the outside world cannot be universal, they cannot get rich experience, and the efficiency of daily work will be greatly affected. Therefore, when encountering difficult things, they can only ask others and ask others to make decisions with them. Isn't this painful?</p>
<p>Therefore, the arrival of responsibility should not be feared or avoided, but only met head-on. It will therefore temper your perseverance and increase your wisdom. And temporary difficulties strengthen your ability and effectiveness in handling things in the future.</p>
<p>Root Xinbo</p>
<p>"Really?" Just this sentence, without continuing, seems like he is thinking about something.</p>
<p>The road gradually slopes down, down to a place only two or three feet above the ground, where a large flat rock is paved. This is the boundary between Little Dai Mountain and Ling Mountain, and also the throat of Ling Mountain Bay leading east to the outside. It is called Dragon Tiger Gate, and it really looks like a gate guarded by Ling Mountain as the dragon and Little Ling Mountain as the tiger. Some children jumped on the rock and said, "There are golden carts and silver axes underneath. People from Jiangxi have seen them!" After saying that, they also put their ears to the stone to listen, and then stood up and said, "There is indeed the sound of car axles underneath."</p>
<p>A Wu and Da Gen walked past the grindstone and onto the foot of Ling Mountain. This is much steeper than Little Ling Mountain, and is full of yellow stones, with no yellow soil for planting. However, the yellow stones on the road are paved into step-by-step levels, which makes it easier to walk.</p>
<p>After walking up for a while, they arrived at a temple in the middle of the mountain. This is the Sanmao Temple. The stone slabs paved in front of the mountain gate are flat. People who come up the mountain almost always take a breath here before entering inside, or going further up. They stopped here and looked at the scenery to the east. Because Little Ling Mountain blocked the south, Ling Mountain itself blocked the north, and Ling Mountain Bay was in the west, only the east and west were open, and you could see infinitely far.</p>
<p>"Have you been to our family's Wubao Mound?" A Wu asked, pointing to a cluster of villages near the foot of Port Mountain.</p>
<p>"I've been there."</p>
<p>"Oh, the place with the most houses is Qiantang Bridge," A Wu said, raising his head a little, "Have you been there too?"</p>
<p>"I've been there. I've been to within ten miles around. But I don't go any further, because other people also have to do business. I only do business within ten miles." (3400)</p>
<p>Begonia Shi Xin</p>
<p>Reviewing spoken drama and reviewing Peking opera are of course different. Centering on acting is the attitude of reviewing Peking opera, and centering on content is the attitude of reviewing spoken drama.</p>
<p>Begonia was performed at the Carlton for more than one hundred shows, and it was full every day. However, there are very few texts reviewing it, it seems that only the "Impressions of Begonia" by Qin Minjun in this newspaper is less than a thousand words, and fortunately this text is very appropriate.</p>
<p>However, with Japanese friends present, Lu Bao once compared it to the "Little Tsukiji" in Japan and praised it. To be fair, it was a bit "feverish." Mr. Hisaichi is originally an expert on spoken drama. I advise Mr. Hisaichi to go to the Great World Amusement Park to see civilized dramas. There are too many Chinese dramas that are better than Begonia.</p>
