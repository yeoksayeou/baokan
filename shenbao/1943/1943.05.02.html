<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">天時·地利·人和 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>「天時不如地利，地利不如人和。」這是孟子認爲軍事上取勝的重點，是在「人和」。同時，也是政治上取得强化地位的重要因素。有了適宜的天時，有了優越的地利，而沒有「人和」來把握運用，其結果還是眨眨眼錯過時機的。</p>
<p>在主席在國府還都三周紀念日告全國國民書中，也特別提示「人和」的重要。更指出英帝國的崩潰，就是爲了失去「人和」。只知推行殖民地政策，重視物質，而把「人」也當「物」看待，趨向於功利主義的極則，結果，如河口決堤，，大水氾濫，崩潰得一發不可收拾。</p>
<p>什麼是人和呢？在主席的解釋：「人除了身體之外，還有精神；除了勞力之外，還有人格，還有意識。尊重其人格，意識，使我之精神，與人之精神團結一致，是之謂人和。」這種人人精神團結一致的「人和」，可以說是積極的。另一種解釋：「人和是得民心之所和樂」，可以說是消極的。我們在今日的時代環境裏，需要先有積極的「人和」，然後可得消極的「人和」。</p>
<p>根據上面的解釋，我們唯一的希望，就是政府能獲得全國的人和，至少先獲得和平區內的人和。雖然，自從在主席倡導和平運動以來，政府一部分領導人物，脊旰勤勞，輔弼協贊，幾年奮鬥的結果，大部分人民對於和運的態度，已由懷疑戒懼進而認識接受·尤其是國府參戰以至日本對華政策轉變以後，進一步重視人民精神上團結。可是，我們要認淸，這些僅僅是「人和」的發軔工作，局部的小有成就。我們必須要得到整個的「人和」，每一個人的精神渾然團結一致，是則惟有待於政治上積極的修明。其次，自從中日不幸事變發生之初，人民遭受戰禍亂離之苦；迨和平運動展開，和平區內人民，原可從此有蘇息之望，但其初因參加和運工作人員，良莠不齊，領導人物，鞭長莫及，絕續之際，難免秩序騷亂，人民感受拉鋸之苦；其後政府地位漸固，除暴安良，人民驚魂甫定，而繼至者爲物價高漲，再受生活壓迫之苦。所以人民迄未得到和樂。戰時國家，人民生活的艱苦，固然是分內的事；不過，要苦得平等平均才能「苦而無怨」，允其是人人精神團結一致，忍受今日的艱苦，爭取明日的「和樂」，是則又惟待於政治上的積極修明。</p>
<p>然則，我們旣已瞭解「人和」爲强化政治地位的最重要因素；同時，也瞭解取得「人和」，以積極修明政治爲必要的途徑。那末，究竟怎樣來修明政治呢？當然，其道多端，我們也曾一再提出多方面的問題。幷且，我們相信最高當局，夙夜辛勤，盡忠國事，俗語有云：「牡丹雖好，全仗綠葉扶持」，獨木支大厦，畢竟吃力不討好的。</p>
<p>所以，今天我們提出增進行政效率的原則，「辦公事簡捷化」，以澈底革除迂迴遲緩官架子的惡習氣，爲修明政治過程中的起點。如果這一點不做到，則一切周密詳盡的政令計畫，徒成紙上具文，更談不到效率。各級政治機構的負責人，絕對遵守辦公時間，悉心處理公務，今日事，今日了。督促部屬工作人員，養成辦事敏捷的習慣。减少公文轉輾的手續，允其是注重公文甩語的簡潔明期，直截了當，廢除不必要的等因奉此的空話，以節省擬稿，繕寫，校對，以至於對方閱者的時間。數機關會辦一事，彼此迅速商決，各負現任，勿互相推諉。同機關相關事務，减少公文週折，儘量利用電話或口頭接洽。總之，非常時期辦公事如臨戰陣，迅赴事功，爭取機先。舊式衙門的暮氣作風，久已不合現代時宜了。</p>
<p>我們可以舉一個近例：上海出版界最近爲了搶救一椿保存文化上比較重要的事件，曾具呈在兼院長，請求核辦；同時函請主席協助，主席根據函稱，即的代表面詢，在行政院正式提出會議之前，迅速處理，結果極爲圓滿。出版界代表對於主席的態度誠摯，考盧周到，處置迅捷，不勝感動。同時，更聯想到各級政府各級負責人，如能一體遵守辦事簡捷之法則，那末，有益民生的事，決不致不能推動，而也是取得「人和」最容易的途徑。</p>
<p>提到有益民生的事，當然方面很多，我們特別盼望政府從已經頒發命令的，必須貫澈主張。如「澈查囤積」，「公務員不准兼商」，「嚴厲禁賭」等等，從各個方向，以取得「人和」，以强化政治地位，以復興國家。</p>
<p>和平區內有寒暖正常，雨水調節的氣候，具備了適宜的天時條件；有肥沃的土地，富庶的物產，具備了優越的地利條件。我們只等着「人和」，去把握運用這已具備的天時地利的好條件。更盼望各級政府的負責人，奉主席的辦事精神爲圭臬，督率所屬，從「辦公事簡捷化」入手，予人民以便利，先從「人和」的發軔工作着手。這是責任，不是義務，願認淸而亟起實行。</p>

<h3 id="c2">日陸軍航空部隊　大舉轟炸雲南機塲　敵機被擊毀者達四十六架　軍事設施兩處均中彈起火 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日大本營十一時發表日陸軍航空部隊，曾於四月二十六及二十八日兩日，奇襲集結於雲南飛機塲之美空軍，所獲戰果如次：（一）擊落五架，（二）炸燬停於陸上並使起火焚燒者四十一架，（三）炸燬軍事設施使起火焚燒者二處。是役日機自炸及未返者各一架。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　美軍爲挽回敗戰頹勢起見，曾積極强化駐渝之美空軍，以圖空襲日本國內。日陸軍航空部隊爲先發粉碎其企圖計，突於上月二十六日及二十八兩日，以戰鬥機及轟炸機之聯合大編隊，奇襲雲南驛西南兩機塲。計擊落並炸毀敵機四十六架之多，予駐渝美空軍以重大打擊。蓋上月二十六日戰鬥機及轟炸機聯合大編隊，奇襲雲南驛南機塲時，該地之敵機幾全被覆滅，當時僅見敵機數架起飛迎戰，且陸上之防空砲火亦極沉寂，是役日機不僅未受損失，且擊落敵機兩架，使起火焚燒者四發動機大型飛機一架，HAU4型八架，擊毀大型機一架，HAU4型十二架，又起火焚燒者計彈藥庫一處，油庫一處，又汽車數輛被毀。按以上數輛汽車，乃停於起火焚燒之大型飛機旁，並被日機以機槍掃射而毀也，二十八日日機復以戰鬥機及轟炸機之聯合大編隊，空襲該機塲，大部份敵機均被覆滅：計擊毀四發動機大型機一架，北美式八架，小型十架，又擊落HAU40型三架。按以上被擊萍之七架，乃於日機飛抵機塲上空與小HAU40型戰鬥機十架空戰時被擊落。是役日機日炸及未返防者各一架。按此次日大本營所發表之戰果與以往同樣，乃以轟炸後所攝留之照片而行判斷，故極爲正確。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　美駐渝空軍向置主力於滇桂方面，以圖窺視對日空襲。據悉昆明方面的有美機七八十架，桂林亦有廿架，此等空軍經日機之攻擊，巳失四十五架，其實力乃大减。同時企圖空襲日本本土之計劃，亦已化爲泡影。據此間募家談論，此次日機之攻擊意義稱，日機此次之攻擊，予在渝美空軍之打擊甚重，當此美在渝空軍司令捷諾特及駐渝美軍司令斯蒂維爾聯抉赴華盛頓請求强化駐渝空軍實力之時，其部下大受衝動，美政府縱然能增派飛機飛渝，亦不過徒作日機之好餌而已。</p>

<p>東京一日中央社電　據名古屋電話，日大本營谷萩陸軍報道部長，曾於三十日下午六時半，在名古屋新公會堂以「大東亞現勢」爲題，發表演說，茲誌其大　如欠：</p>
<p>「第一大東亞戰局之現勢」我國已在大東亞確立政戰兩面之必勝態勢，我軍已隨時隨地擊破敵軍之反攻，復在準備發動大規模之新作戰。今日我陸軍之防衛地域，係以我國本土爲中心，凡以五千公里爲半徑之全圓周內所包括之大陸以及大洋各島，均屬之，復根據其狀况，以該處所設施之戰略據點爲出發，進行一大進攻作戰，是以我陸軍之責任，深感重大。（甲）阿留地安方面敵軍近曾強化該方面之戰備，將其飛行塲地推進至嗚神島以東之阿姆蒂加島，最近連日以大隊飛機，來襲我佔領島嶼，我軍士氣極爲旺盛，我機每决均昇空遙擊，收獲莫大戰果。（乙）緬甸方面英印軍爲圖奪回緬甸，及自去歲臘月以來，命共精銳部隊，越過國境，向日溪前進，但我部隊，於三月上旬，即轉取攻勢，遂與其在馬酉河畔，展開激戰，予以重創，刻我軍正續在各地肅淸，並追擊殘敵中。我軍經此次激戰後，使英印軍第六（白人部隊）第四十七第五十四第七十一第一百二十三等五旅團，以及加拉瓦支隊，（混成一聯隊，）全部獲滅，並使第四第五第八十八等三旅團潰散。（丙）西南太平洋方面我軍，已自辛汶羣島以及班達羣島等各要點要綫，設立戰略根據地，確立完成新作戰之基礎，並機續實行空軍擊滅作戰，擊毀敵方基地，擊落並擊毀多數敵機，炸沉敵艦，尤其運輸船等甚多，以切斷敵方之補給路等，均獲得莫大戰果。（丁）中國方而，中國方而我軍在極長之戰綫與渝軍相對峙，益於適當事機，實行進攻作戰，或擊毀渝軍戰力，確保治安。二月廿一日，我陸海軍部隊，在法政府諒解之下，進駐廣州灣法屬租借地，並日法聯合防衛越南協定之旨趣，防範渝軍之運動於未然，又在鄂省洞庭湖北方及蘇省蘇淮地區，開始作戰，已於三月中旬結束，其後肅清殘餘渝軍之工作，亦吿完畢，（戊）滿蘇國境方面，我國在此大東亞戰爭之現階段下，鞏固北方防衛爲不動之國策，日前蘇滿國境安謐如恒，蘇軍之非法越境事件等，亦已减少，然爲防備萬一情勢發生變化，故已作萬全之戒備。</p>
<p>「第二世界情勢」：（甲）歐洲戰况—德蘇戰塲，現巳至解凍時期，道路泥濘不堪，故戰事除列寗格勒方面以外，餘均暫吿停止狀態，大致兩軍仍在去年德軍發動夏季攻勢之戰綫，互相對峙中。至北非方面，德義軍巳由突尼西亞北海岸之塞拉多山岬，退至通德東海岸恩斐達維爾之正面的一百五十公里之新戰綫，加緊準備。該綫爲高達七八百分公尺之山丘地帶，地位頗爲衝要，盟軍亦已開到。至於義大利突尼期間之海上接濟之掩護，亦極爲良好，故能作強力防禦。（乙）德義情勢，德國人力現仍極爲充足，德食糧亦能供給勢力，國內需要軍火工業能力更極充足，德人充分信任希特勒元首，戰意極爲旺盛。義國在　案裏尼首相領導之下，政治力量，日趨強大，故其戰力之謀略宣傳，而發生絲毫動搖，且反而更趨鞏固，穩如礎石。（丙）英美渝之情勢，美國之生產力，雖未可輕見，但已至其限度，其軍火生產之遠低於預定計劃，確爲事實。「結論」此次戰爭誠如宣戰大詔所御示者，我國係爲自衛而奮然崛起者，以謀剷除一切障碍，我國之隆替，東亞之與廢，均在此一戰。報君殉國，即在於此。深信我一億國民在八纮一宇之皇謨下，努力邁進，必能使英美降伏，而獲得最後勝利。，而獲得最後勝利。</p>

<p>柏林一日中央社電　據海通社軍事特派員稱，目星期四午刻至星期五午刻，突尼西亞局勢，並無重要變動。一般戰鬥，僅有斤堠隊及襲擊隊之尋常衝突，祇在數處地點，有較爲猛烈之戰鬥，但亦未超乎局部性質。在西綫海岸地區，法軍之前進，已被德軍砲火所阻遏，美軍第二軍現仍被阻於傑夫納山隘及西迪西爾之前，此項部隊，在最近所獲之進展，實屬甚少。在傑貝爾安格方面作戰之英軍，亦係如此。在梅傑茲埃爾巴勃以東之局部戰鬥，現時巳由德軍主動，英美坦克車隊於星期三，在此間向德包爾巴進攻，遭受重大之挫敗後，現時顯然仍受影響。星期四反軸心軍在梅傑茲埃爾巴勃之東，完全採取守勢，德軍則在重佔之地區，從事肅淸殘敵，稍進至南面。安特森將軍在庫爾齊亞監湖附近，集中强大之部隊，但現時尙未開始行動。法軍又向彭杜法斯攻擊，亦遭軸心之密集火力所擊潰。英第八軍之左翼，亦自傑比比納向彭杜法斯之德陣地攻擊，但遭德軍猛烈反攻所擊退，並放棄其暫時佔領之土地。蒙高茂萊將軍之右翼，亦未能有任何新成就，反軸心軍是否將繼續以重大之代價從事現時之攻擊戰，抑將以較小之代價從事圍困戰，須待將來方能知曉。</p>
<p>吐林一日中央社電　斯坦霸報載稱，軸心軍在突尼西亞之缺點，係由於德義軍管轄下少沿海一帶，登陸設備，極不完備，致大批軍火配備，及其他供給品運抵後，即感無法應付，况西西里海峽又易於遭受反軸心海空軍之政擊，此外如飛機塲之缺少，且其中在技術方面須加改良之處頗多，亦爲軸心軍不利之一端云。</p>

<p>（沮利希田口特派員二十七日發）當此次世界大戰開始的時候，英美所犯的錯誤，是對軸心國的戰力估計太低，對蘇聯的戰力，英美也犯了同樣的過失。英美之所以低估軸心國並蘇聯之戰力者，實起於英美希望永久維待其自身的世界支配體制，自身的地位，不爲這許多新興國家的抬頭而石左。他們根據這希望的觀測，當然產生了上述的錯誤。蘇聯所表現的意外的抗戰力，及德軍之强靭的戰鬥力，同被英美視爲可怖的新發見。蘇聯怎樣戰的？蘇聯國民生活的狀態如何？蘇聯國民對英美拖着怎樣的思想？這種蘇聯的國內情勢，殆不能從外部來窺測。最近，自開戰時起迄去年初英報新聞紀事報派駐於蘇聯的特派昌斐立浦。喬登，在其近著中，對蘇聯的國內情勢，及英美援蘇的實際，對蘇外交的底蘊，叙述頗詳。資料雖不一定是最新的，但把蘇聯的現狀，描繪出一個鮮明的輪廓。蘇聯政府對英美二國所懷的不信與危懼之念，亦會加以說明，涉及英美對蘇國交的眞相，至堪玩味，茲介紹其大概於下：</p>
<p>著者先從蘇聯的工業力着手，叙述蘇聯國內的一般情况如次：</p>
<p>蘇聯的工業發達上最堪注意者，蘇聯建設了獨自的工作機械工業。記者會參觀莫斯科地方並庫璧希夫，烏拉爾間的軍需工塲，大部分工作機械均係自製，美國製造者佔極少數。德蘇開戰時，蘇聯全境製造戰鬥機的工塲不過四家，現在有六家至八家。開戰時起，莫斯科，基輔，卡科夫等地的軍需工塲，向烏拉爾新工業中心地開始遷移，把工塲設備運至烏拉爾山脈地帶的列車，蜿蜓數十里，規模極爲偉大。</p>
<p>烏拉爾地帶雖已成爲工業地帶，但其全貌尙未能明瞭。不過依記者看來，一九四一年秋的莫斯科防衛戰，所使用的兵器及資材，完全是蘇聯自製的。在戰爭初期，會使用英國製戰車，不久，即暴露其火器的力量極爲微弱。一九四一年十月起所訂定的每月應供給於蘇聯的英美轟炸機，迄翌年二月止，一架也沒有，僅在四個月後始在伊拉克的飛行塲見到幾架。</p>
<p>小麥是援蘇物資中最重要的物資之一，自烏克蘭喪失以後，在一九四二年糧食卽吿不足。蘇聯的軍需生產力，我們以爲不能輕視，所以蘇聯今日所急需者，不在軍需品而係食糧。蘇聯自與英美締結物資援助的協定之後，第二戰綫迄未開闢成功，又英國的政治家依然企圖保持英國的指導地位，以此，蘇聯對於英美的究極意圖不能不懷疑慮。</p>
<p>英國陸軍將校之間，多以爲英國將來必須抑制蘇聯，正如現在抑制德國一樣。蘇聯認爲這就是英國當局的見解之暗示。蘇聯鑒於英軍部當道的反蘇感情，所以現在的作戰計劃，一方面儘量求取英國的援助物資，一方面並設法使本國在戰爭終了之際不致限於國力全部消耗的境地。因而蘇聯對英國的保守黨政治家，和美國財閥懷抱不信任的意念。</p>
<p>至於國民生活方面，石炭雖吿不足，致民間在冬季巳無取暖設備，但蘇聯民衆對於這種物資的缺乏狀况，甘之如飴，毫無不平的表示。</p>

<p>中央社滬訊，最近滬市常有一般不暹之徒，偽稱係軍部或憲兵隊暗探，向無事華人橫加脅迫，或詐取金錢，實屬不法已極。日上海憲兵隊有鑒於此，已加以嚴重取締，同時澈底拘捕此輩不逞份子，以肅淸此種不法行爲。頃鑒於事件性質之重大，爲希望市民一致予以協力起見，憲兵隊常局特發表談話如次：</p>
<p>日憲兵隊當局談話</p>
<p>上海憲兵隊前已向滬市中日人及第三國人頒發警吿，嚴重取締一般偽稱軍部或憲兵而向良民詐取金錢之中　　逞份子。最近因經濟問題，一部份市民似有不安現象，乃此輩不良份子，利用此種機會，罪案有激增之傾向，實屬遺憾。一般不法之徒，偽迭軍部或憲兵隊暗探名義，或利用憲兵，向囤積隱匿物資者以及不法商人，甚至一般無辜華人，强詐金錢。</p>
<p>四個月來案犯纍纍</p>
<p>本年初至四月底，所破獲之此項罪案，共計二十七件，罪犯三十六名，其中二十三名係華人，十三名係日人及其他國人。經判處徒刑者十二件，即席處分者五件，驅逐出境者三件，其他均尙在鄭重調查中。被害人中有被詐取美金九千元舊法幣三萬五千元，或儲備券一萬一千元者，憲兵隊對於此輩不逞之徒，認係冒凟日軍威信，乃予以嚴厲處分，不稍寬貸，希望中日市民相警相戒，協力當局從事取締，以達到建設明朗大上海之目的。</p>
<p>揑造名義危害民衆</p>
<p>又軍部人員以及憲兵，當執行職務之際，常持有身份證明書或服務記錄簿，不獨並無要求金錢物品等行爲，即類似脅迫之言動等亦絕對避免。故今後倘發覺有揑造憲兵或憲兵隊暗探名義而有不法舉動者，應立即報吿就近憲兵隊，以便拘捕。</p>
<p>罪案一般</p>
<p>據調查所得，上項罪案中，其情節重大者有（一）居住法租界之其荷蘭婦人，隱藏未經申報之責金屬五十萬餘元，爲若輩偵知，即偽稱憲兵隊員，橫加脅迫，卒强奪貴金屬達二十五種，罪犯已逮捕，處刑一年。（二）有陳阿方者，因有偷竊棉花嫌疑，亦被用憲兵隊名義詐取一千元，此外並有舊木料商人，亦被脅迫奪取八十元。（三）有某不逞之徒，在某茶館自稱係憲兵隊晤探，謂如壽以五千元運動費，可將拘捕者釋放。（四）誣稱某人私通游擊隊，以不予逮捕爲條件，卒詐得美金九千元及舊法幣三萬五千七百元。綜上而觀，可知若輩常乘當事人弱點，乘機脅迫，强詐金錢，類此事件，層出不窮，深望市民善體當局意旨，共同協力，以期得以迅予撲滅類此惡風。</p>

<p>今後金融界正常之業務，厥爲扶植生產機構，換言之，即爲工廠之後盾，以大部分力量，來幫助工廠努力生產。</p>
<p>金融界放軟於工廠，不當官目的，更不是情面的，必須根據實際的成績，認爲有値得放款的地方，纔可予以放軟的便利。</p>
<p>所以事前要經過縝密的調查周詳的研究，與一切科學方面的分析。必須覺得這個工廠　在大的方面，臺的方面，物的方面，都是値得放款，然後放款，決不要憑着一時的感情，更不要做着表面文章，敷衍塞責。</p>
<p>尤其是重在放軟以後，還要不斷的予以技術上的指導。已往放款以後，一切不聞不問的辦法，巳成過去的事。今後要有專家協助各工廠從事於研究，分析考查，審核等工作，道是不可少的。最好物色許多的工程師，來遂一的設計研究；每一工塲，每一部分，都須仗着工程家的全副精神與力量，加以改進的。如果每一工塲每一部分有不對的地方，便須早早研究其應行改革的方法，千萬不要客氣，不要苟且。記得香港有一個磚瓦廠，某天一位經理請電機工程家來觀察，纔知馬達的舊布帶壞了，每一動作，便須改遲數秒鐘，結果每月白白地消費許多電力。後來廠方經雷機工程師改裝新的皮帶以後，每月要省去雷費二千七百餘元。可見技術與生產關係之重，是無可疑問的。希望金融界於從嚴自肅以後，便須注意於這種科學方法的生產放款。</p>

<p>現實與原則　中國參戰的理想與現實，應該有嚴格的區別，淸晰的比較，假使發覺其間有間隙的話，爲了使現實合乎理想起見，必須不惜任何努力去幹，最最要不得的，就是對於現實去作姑息的妥協，近衛三原則：至今日本國民還當它是對華政治，經齊，文化態度的基本，同時國府及其治下國民，應該根據其和平建國的各種原則，與各種參戰理想，展開忠實果敢的戰時活動，來一下切實的自我批判，然則中國參戰的基本原則是什麼呢？這就是參加大東亞戰爭使成爲具有眞正意義的國民戰爭。</p>
<p>日本國民對於國府，對於民族資本，以及對於中國國民所期待者：乃爲推進國民戰爭，亦即從速確立戰時體制。由於囤積行爲而透視出來的中國政治，經濟，思想現實，其阻碍國民戰爭的嚴重也不用繁複曉舌，總之，凡是阻碍推進國民戰爭者，不論何人，都應議處，再進一步言，此種份子，應該加以利敵行爲之罪，澈底肅淸。今後國府爲推進國民戰爭，必須獲得民衆的强力支持與信賴，但是阻碍此國民戰爭者，實爲囤積問題，因之，非有撒底解決不可。</p>
<p>中國參戰下的政治，經濟思想，一切的一切，都被囤積事件歪曲了參戰的道義性，故而囤積爲中國國民所惡，也爲日本國民所惡，日本國民戰爭與中國國民戰爭，是站在同生共死結合關係而求大東亞戰爭勝利的國民戰爭，所以，對於破壞中國國民的民生，使其他參戰條件不安的囤積問題，極力主張要加以根絕。</p>
<p>新經濟政策與囤積問題無論任何時期，任何國家，囤積問題，沒有不使一國國民受到嚴重影響的，中國參戰之後，芷在向新經濟政策出發之初，對此項問題的事實，不得不加以重視，唯有澈底肅淸囤積，才是忠實履行新經濟政策的第一個步驟，此言决非過甚其辭的高調。</p>
<p>爲了强化參戰下的國府政治經濟力，故而要動員中國民族資本於華中的物資政策與經濟政策上，發揮其自主與創造的精神，俾得使華中成爲完成大東亞戰爭的兵站根據地。同時以全體民族資本，全體中國國民爲對象，旨在促進援助中國戰時國民經濟的確立。</p>
<p>國府及中國國民，也都協力日方的轉換經濟政策，首先創立了全國商業統制總會，越二旬之後，囤積問題轉成了政治問題化，不但中國人民重視，就是日本國民也很重視此點。爲實施新政策，强化國府努力，在推行新經濟政策之時，必須注意三個必要條件：</p>
<p>第一：全體的國府與全體的民族資本的新經濟政策，必須强力合作。</p>
<p>第二：國府內部對新經濟政策的協力，必須强固。</p>
<p>第三：民族資本對新經濟政策的相互提携，必須强固。</p>
<p>如果以上三個條件不能實現，則新經濟政策徒成空話。同時也必須解決囤積問題，才能達到上項目的，所以我們十二萬分的希望其能澈底解決。（雲鵬：續譯四月廿九日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Weather, Terrain, and Popular Support <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>"Timely opportunity is not as important as advantageous terrain, and advantageous terrain is not as important as popular support." This is what Mencius considered to be the key to military victory, focusing on "popular support." At the same time, it is also an important factor in strengthening one's position politically. Having a favorable time, having superior terrain, but lacking "popular support" to grasp and utilize them, the result will still be missing the opportunity in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>In his address to the nation on the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital, the Chairman also specifically pointed out the importance of "popular support." He further pointed out that the collapse of the British Empire was due to the loss of "popular support." Knowing only to promote colonial policies, valuing material things, and treating "people" as "things," tending towards the extreme of utilitarianism, the result was like a river breaking its banks, with a great flood inundating everything, collapsing beyond repair.</p>
<p>What is popular support? In the Chairman's explanation: "Besides the body, people also have spirit; besides labor, they also have personality and consciousness. Respecting their personality and consciousness, so that my spirit unites with the spirit of the people, this is called popular support." This "popular support" of everyone's spirit united as one can be said to be active. Another interpretation: "Popular support is the harmony and happiness of winning the hearts of the people," which can be said to be passive. In today's era and environment, we need to first have active "popular support," and then we can obtain passive "popular support."</p>
<p>Based on the above explanation, our only hope is that the government can gain the support of the people nationwide, at least first gain the support of the people within the peace zones. Although, since the Chairman initiated the peace movement, some leading figures in the government have been diligent and hardworking, assisting and supporting it. After several years of struggle, most of the people's attitude towards the peace movement has progressed from suspicion and apprehension to understanding and acceptance. Especially after the National Government's entry into the war and the subsequent change in Japan's policy towards China, greater importance has been attached to the spiritual unity of the people. However, we must recognize that these are only the beginning stages of "popular support," with only partial small achievements. We must obtain the entire "popular support," with the spirit of every single person wholly united as one, and this can only be achieved by actively improving politics. Secondly, since the beginning of the unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident, the people have suffered from the calamities of war and displacement. When the peace movement began, the people within the peace zones could have hoped to have some respite from this, but initially, because the personnel participating in the peace movement were of mixed quality, and the leading figures could not reach everywhere, the situation was inevitably chaotic, and the people suffered from the tug-of-war. Later, as the government's position gradually stabilized, eliminating violence and pacifying the good people, the people's terrified souls were initially calmed, but what followed was the soaring of commodity prices, and they suffered again from the oppression of life. Therefore, the people have not yet achieved harmony and happiness. During wartime, the hardships of the people's lives in a nation are, of course, a matter of duty; however, it must be "suffering without complaint" only if the suffering is equal and average, allowing everyone's spirit to be united as one, enduring today's hardships and striving for tomorrow's "harmony and happiness," which can only be achieved by actively improving politics.</p>
<p>Then, since we already understand that "popular support" is the most important factor in strengthening political status; at the same time, we also understand that taking "popular support" and actively improving politics is a necessary path. Then, how exactly should we improve politics? Of course, there are many ways, and we have repeatedly raised questions from many aspects. Moreover, we believe that the highest authorities are working hard day and night, faithfully serving the country. As the saying goes: "No matter how beautiful the peony is, it all depends on the support of the green leaves." A single pillar supporting a tall building is, after all, an effort that is not rewarding.</p>
<p>Therefore, today we propose the principle of increasing administrative efficiency, "simplifying office procedures," to thoroughly eliminate the bad habit of circuitous, slow, and bureaucratic airs, as a starting point in the process of improving politics. If this point is not achieved, then all meticulous and detailed political plans will only become empty words on paper, and there will be no talk of efficiency. Those in charge of political institutions at all levels must strictly adhere to office hours, carefully handle official duties, and complete today's work today. Urge subordinates and staff to develop the habit of being quick in handling affairs. Reduce the procedures for the transmission of official documents, allowing for an emphasis on the conciseness and clarity of the language used in official documents, being straightforward and eliminating unnecessary clichés such as "accordingly, we hereby," in order to save time for drafting, writing, proofreading, and even for the reader on the other end. When several agencies jointly handle a matter, they should quickly discuss and decide with each other, each taking responsibility for their current duties, and not shirking responsibility to each other. For related matters within the same agency, reduce the back-and-forth of official documents and use telephone or oral contact as much as possible. In short, handling official matters during extraordinary times is like being on a battlefield, quickly rushing to accomplish tasks and seizing opportunities. The old-fashioned, sluggish style of government offices has long been out of step with modern times.</p>
<p>We can cite a recent example: The Shanghai publishing industry recently submitted a request to the concurrent President of the Executive Yuan, requesting a review of a relatively important event for the preservation of culture; at the same time, they sent a letter to the Chairman for assistance. Based on the letter, the Chairman immediately met with representatives to inquire, and quickly handled the matter before it was formally submitted to the Executive Yuan for a meeting, resulting in a very satisfactory outcome. The publishing representatives were deeply moved by the Chairman's sincere attitude, thoughtful consideration, and swift handling. At the same time, they also thought of the fact that if government officials at all levels could adhere to the principle of simplifying office procedures, then matters that benefit the people's livelihood would certainly not be impossible to promote, and it would also be the easiest way to obtain "popular support."</p>
<p>Speaking of matters that benefit the people's livelihood, of course, there are many aspects. We especially hope that the government will thoroughly implement the orders that have already been issued. Such as "thoroughly investigating hoarding," "government officials not being allowed to engage in commerce," and "strictly prohibiting gambling," etc., from all directions, to obtain "popular support," to strengthen political status, and to revitalize the nation.</p>
<p>The peace zones have a climate with normal temperature, and regulated rainfall, possessing suitable weather conditions; they have fertile land, and abundant products, possessing superior terrain conditions. We are only waiting for "popular support" to grasp and utilize these good conditions of weather and terrain that are already in place. We also hope that those in charge of governments at all levels will take the Chairman's spirit of handling affairs as their guiding principle, leading their subordinates, starting with "simplifying office procedures," providing convenience to the people, and starting with the beginning stages of "popular support." This is a responsibility, not an obligation, and it is hoped that it will be clearly recognized and implemented immediately.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) — At 11 o'clock, the Japanese General Headquarters announced that the Japanese Army Air Force had, on April 26th and 28th, launched surprise attacks on American airfields concentrated in Yunnan, with the following results: (1) 5 shot down, (2) 41 destroyed on the ground and set ablaze, (3) military facilities destroyed and set ablaze in 2 places. During the operation, one Japanese aircraft was self-detonated and one did not return.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) — In order to reverse the losing trend, the American army actively strengthened the American air force stationed in Chongqing, attempting to launch air raids on Japan. In order to preemptively crush this attempt, the Japanese Army Air Force, on the 26th and 28th of last month, launched surprise attacks on the Yunnan-yi southwest airfields with a large combined formation of fighters and bombers. A total of 46 enemy aircraft were shot down and destroyed, inflicting a major blow on the American air force stationed in Chongqing. On the 26th of last month, when the combined formation of fighters and bombers launched a surprise attack on the south airfield of Yunnan-yi, almost all of the enemy aircraft there were wiped out. At that time, only a few enemy aircraft took off to intercept, and the anti-aircraft fire on the ground was also extremely quiet. In this operation, the Japanese aircraft not only suffered no losses, but also shot down two enemy aircraft, setting ablaze one large four-engine aircraft, eight HAU4 types, destroying one large aircraft, twelve HAU4 types, and setting ablaze one ammunition depot, one oil depot, and several vehicles. These vehicles were parked next to the large aircraft that were set ablaze, and were destroyed by Japanese aircraft with machine gun fire. On the 28th, Japanese aircraft again used a large combined formation of fighters and bombers to attack the airfield, and most of the enemy aircraft were destroyed: one large four-engine aircraft, eight North American types, and ten small types were destroyed, and three HAU40 types were shot down. These seven aircraft that were shot down were shot down during an air battle with ten small HAU40 fighters when the Japanese aircraft arrived over the airfield. In this operation, one Japanese aircraft was self-detonated and one did not return. As with previous announcements, the results announced by the Japanese General Headquarters this time were judged based on photographs taken after the bombing, so they are extremely accurate.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) — The American air force stationed in Chongqing has placed its main force in the Yunnan-Guangxi area, attempting to spy and air raid Japan. It is reported that there are 70-80 American aircraft in the Kunming area, and 20 in Guilin. After the attacks by Japanese aircraft, these air forces have lost 45 aircraft, and their strength has been greatly reduced. At the same time, the plan to air raid the Japanese mainland has also become a pipe dream. According to discussions among recruiters here, the significance of this Japanese aircraft attack is that it has inflicted a heavy blow on the American air force in Chongqing. At a time when the American air force commander in Chongqing, General Chennault, and the American military commander in Chongqing, General Stilwell, jointly went to Washington to request strengthening the strength of the American air force stationed in Chongqing, their subordinates were greatly shocked. Even if the American government can send more aircraft to Chongqing, it will only be a good target for Japanese aircraft.</p>

<p>Hong Kong, 1st (Central News Agency) — The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in Southern China went to Guangzhou Bay and the occupied territories of the Leizhou Peninsula for inspection from the 25th to the 27th of last month. At 12:00 noon on the 27th, he returned to Hong Kong by waterway. When he met with his spouse in Shouchong on the same day, he talked about the future of Guangzhou Bay and his feelings about inspecting the battlefields. He said that thanks to the cooperation of the local Japanese and French authorities, Guangzhou Bay has been completely renewed. Judging from its good situation, there will be no problems now and in the future. He believed that the land of the Leizhou Peninsula lacked productivity, so the materials in the leased territory could not be self-sufficient, and had to rely on the subsidy of light industrial products from Guangdong and other places. Guangdong's light industry is now actively increasing its production. Judging from the geographical relationship, the material trade with Hainan Island will definitely be frequent in the future. The Japanese military occupied areas are now gradually progressing due to the efforts of the local Japanese military in various constructions. The local people are also quite cooperative. The activities of the Chongqing army are irrelevant.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Valley Hagi Press Department Head's Speech: Reviewing the Global War Situation; Japan Achieving Significant Gains in Various Regions; German-Italian Relations Increasingly Solid and Steadfast <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st Central News Agency Dispatch: According to a Nagoya telephone report, Major General Valley Hagi, head of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, delivered a speech at the Nagoya New Public Hall at 6:30 p.m. on the 30th, titled "The Current Situation in Greater East Asia." A summary is as follows:</p>
<p>"First, the Current Situation of the Greater East Asia War": Our country has established a winning position in both political and military aspects in Greater East Asia. Our army is crushing enemy counterattacks at any time and place and is preparing to launch large-scale new operations. Today, the defense area of our army is centered on our mainland. It includes the mainland and islands of the ocean within a full circumference with a radius of 5,000 kilometers. Based on the situation, we will launch a major offensive operation from the strategic strongholds established there. Therefore, the responsibility of our army is deeply felt to be significant. (A) Aleutian Islands Area: The enemy has recently strengthened its war preparations in this area, advancing its airfield to Amutka Island, east of Oshima Island. Recently, large squadrons of aircraft have attacked our occupied islands on a daily basis. Our army's morale is extremely high. Our aircraft have resolutely taken to the air to intercept them, achieving great results. (B) Burma Area: In an attempt to recapture Burma, the British-Indian army has, since the last month of last year, ordered its elite troops to cross the border and advance towards Nikkei. However, our troops took the offensive in early March, engaging them in fierce battles on the banks of the Ma Yu River, inflicting heavy damage. Our army is currently continuing to mop up and pursue the remaining enemies in various places. After this fierce battle, our army annihilated the British-Indian 6th (White Unit), 47th, 54th, 71st, and 123rd Brigades, and the Garawa Detachment (a mixed regiment), and dispersed the 4th, 5th, and 88th Brigades. (C) Southwest Pacific Area: Our army has established strategic bases on key points and lines, such as the Xinwen Islands and Banda Islands, establishing the foundation for completing new operations. We are continuing to carry out air force annihilation operations, destroying enemy bases, shooting down and destroying numerous enemy aircraft, and sinking many enemy ships, especially transport ships, to cut off enemy supply routes, achieving great results. (D) China Area: In the Chinese area, our army confronts the Chongqing army on an extremely long front. We will take the opportunity to carry out offensive operations, destroy the Chongqing army's combat power, and ensure security. On February 21, with the understanding of the French government, our army and navy troops were stationed in the French concession of Guangzhou Bay. In accordance with the spirit of the Japan-France joint defense agreement in Vietnam, we are preventing the Chongqing army's movements before they happen. We have also started operations north of Dongting Lake in Hubei Province and in the Suhuai area of Jiangsu Province, which ended in mid-March. Since then, the work of mopping up the remaining Chongqing army has also been completed. (E) Manchuria-Soviet Border Area: In the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, consolidating the northern defense is our unshakeable national policy. The Soviet-Manchurian border has been peaceful as always, and illegal border crossings by Soviet troops have also decreased. However, in order to prepare for any changes in the situation, we have made full preparations.</p>
<p>"Second, the World Situation": (A) European War Situation—The German-Soviet battlefield has now reached the thawing season. The roads are muddy and impassable, so the fighting has temporarily stopped, except in the Leningrad area. Generally, the two armies are still facing each other on the battle line where the German army launched its summer offensive last year. As for North Africa, the German-Italian army has retreated from the Sera do Mountain promontory on the north coast of Tunisia to the new 150-kilometer front in front of Enfidaville on the east coast of Tonder, stepping up preparations. This line is a hilly area with a height of seven or eight hundred meters, and its location is quite important. The Allied forces have also arrived. The maritime supply to Italy during the Tunisian period is also well protected, so it can provide a strong defense. (B) The Situation in Germany and Italy: Germany's manpower is still extremely sufficient, and Germany's food can also supply its power. The domestic arms industry capacity is even more sufficient. The German people fully trust Führer Hitler, and their fighting spirit is extremely strong. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Anelli in Italy, political power is becoming increasingly strong, so its combat power's strategy and propaganda have not been shaken in the slightest, and on the contrary, they are becoming more and more consolidated and as stable as a cornerstone. (C) The Situation in Britain, the United States, and Chongqing: Although the productivity of the United States cannot be taken lightly, it has reached its limit. It is a fact that its arms production is far below the planned target. "Conclusion": This war is just like what the declaration of war showed. Our country rose up courageously for self-defense in order to eliminate all obstacles. The rise and fall of our country and the fate of East Asia are all in this battle. Serving the country is to die for this cause. We deeply believe that under the Emperor's plan of unifying the world, our 100 million people will work hard to advance, and we will surely be able to subdue Britain and the United States and achieve final victory. , And win the final victory.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Battles at Mejez El Bab: German Army Gains the Initiative; British Forces at Pont du Fahs Retreat After Fierce Attacks <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st Central News Agency Dispatch: According to a military correspondent for the Hai Tung News Agency, there have been no major changes in the situation in Tunisia from noon on Thursday to noon on Friday. General fighting has been limited to the usual conflicts of sentinel and raiding parties, with more intense fighting occurring in only a few locations, but not exceeding a local nature. On the west coast, the French advance has been blocked by German artillery fire. The US Second Corps is still being blocked in front of the Jefna Pass and Sidi Cel, and these units have made very little progress recently. The same is true for the British forces operating in the Djebel Ang area. The local battles east of Mejez El Bab are now being initiated by the German army. The Anglo-American tank corps suffered a major defeat in their attack on Debauerba on Wednesday, and they are apparently still affected. On Thursday, the anti-Axis forces in the east of Mejez El Bab were completely on the defensive, while the German army cleared out the remaining enemies in the reoccupied areas and advanced slightly to the south. General Anderson has concentrated a large force near Lake Kurzia, but has not yet started operations. The French attack on Pont du Fahs was also crushed by the Axis's intensive fire. The left wing of the British Eighth Army also attacked the German positions at Pont du Fahs from Djebibina, but was repelled by a fierce German counterattack and abandoned its temporarily occupied territory. General Montgomery's right wing has also failed to achieve any new achievements. It remains to be seen whether the anti-Axis forces will continue to engage in the current attack war at a great cost, or whether they will engage in a siege war at a lower cost.</p>
<p>Turin, 1st Central News Agency Dispatch: The Stanba newspaper reported that the Axis's shortcomings in Tunisia are due to the lack of coastal areas under the jurisdiction of the German-Italian army and the extremely incomplete landing equipment. As a result, when a large number of munitions and other supplies arrive, they feel unable to cope. Moreover, the Strait of Sicily is vulnerable to attacks by the anti-Axis naval and air forces. In addition, the lack of airfields and the fact that many of them need to be technically improved are also disadvantages for the Axis forces.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Three-Nation Conference Held at the German President's Headquarters; Concrete Exchange of Views on the International Situation <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st Central News Agency Dispatch: According to an official announcement from the President's Headquarters on the 30th, President Hitler met with French Chief Laval and Italian representatives on the 29th to hold a three-nation conference. Prior to this conference, French Chief Laval had held several rounds of consultations with Marshal Pétain and French government leaders in Paris and Vichy. When French representative to Paris Brinon arrived at the German President's Headquarters, Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Paschani, Director of the European Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Vitiqi, and Chief of Protocol Li Qi had already arrived at the German President's Headquarters one after another. When French Chief Laval arrived in Berlin, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop went to the station to greet him and then began the three-nation conference with the Italian representatives. It is said that during this preparatory conference, President Hitler had a three-hour meeting with Laval, Ribbentrop, and Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Paschani. As for the content of the conference, the authorities only issued a simple communiqué, but although no detailed information was released, authoritative sources believe that when the anti-Axis forces illegally invaded French territory in North Africa, Chief Laval met with President Hitler twice in November and December 1942. Although the French government did not officially join the Axis camp, in fact, the national policies of Germany and France are based on full cooperation between the two countries as a major premise. Therefore, the three-nation representatives seem to have exchanged concrete views on the mission of the French government and the French people when the Axis forces recently launched their summer offensive. After the conference, Ribbentrop hosted a banquet to entertain the representatives of various countries. According to a telegram from Paris, Chief Laval returned to Paris by train at 4:40 p.m. on the 30th.</p>
<p>Paris, 1st Central News Agency Dispatch: After French government chief Laval visited the German Führer's headquarters, he returned to the East Station here by special train at 4 p.m. yesterday. Many important figures from Germany and France greeted him at the station, including French government officials currently stationed in Paris and representatives of the German embassy, ​​as well as the commander of the German forces stationed in France. After exchanging greetings with the crowd, Laval took a car to the Matignon Hotel with his entourage and hosted the press at the hotel last night.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 1st Central News Agency Dispatch: The Southwest Pacific has become the main battlefield for the Japanese and American navies. Due to the repeated battles of the Japanese air force, the advantage of the decisive battle completely belongs to the Japanese army. The US military's attempt to counterattack has now been greatly frustrated. At the same time, Japanese submarines are also responding to this, active in the waters of the area, posing a major threat to the US Navy. On April 24 and 30, they first sank two enemy transport ships of 6,000 tons and 12,000 tons, making the enemy's transportation in the area even more dangerous.</p>

<p>Shonan, 1st Central News Agency Dispatch: Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki inspected North Borneo and then returned to Shonan. He met with the Shonan press corps and gave a talk explaining his impressions after inspecting Borneo. In his talk, the Minister of Greater East Asia stated that North Borneo is less developed and constructed than other southern regions, and the villages are also poorer. However, the awareness of construction is very strong, so the results can be expected. Especially in terms of education, we will use Japanese teachers with rich experience to teach the local people Japanese, so that they can speak simple Japanese in a short period of time. The local teachers are also cooperating with each other, so that the children and young people of the new East Asia can already sing Japanese songs, which is even more memorable. Finally, Minister of Greater East Asia Qingda also broadcast on the Shonan Broadcasting Station, entitled "Impressions of Visiting the Local Southern Areas."</p>

<h3 id="e31">A Review of the Internal Situation in the Soviet Union (1): The Soviet Union's View of Britain and the United States <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent Taguchi from Zurich, 27th) When this World War began, the mistake made by Britain and the United States was that they underestimated the combat power of the Axis powers. Britain and the United States also made the same mistake in their assessment of the combat power of the Soviet Union. The reason why Britain and the United States underestimated the combat power of the Axis powers and the Soviet Union was that Britain and the United States hoped to permanently maintain their own world domination system and their own position, and did not want to be left behind by the rise of these many emerging countries. They naturally produced the above-mentioned mistakes based on this hoped-for observation. The unexpected resistance shown by the Soviet Union and the strong fighting power of the German army were both regarded as terrifying new discoveries by Britain and the United States. How did the Soviet Union fight? What is the state of the Soviet people's lives? What thoughts do the Soviet people have about Britain and the United States? This kind of internal situation in the Soviet Union can hardly be窥测 from the outside. Recently, special envoy Chang Philip Jordan, who was stationed in the Soviet Union by the British newspaper News Chronicle from the beginning of the war until the beginning of last year, described in detail in his recent book the internal situation in the Soviet Union, the reality of British and American aid to the Soviet Union, and the inside story of Soviet diplomacy. Although the data is not necessarily the latest, it paints a vivid outline of the current situation in the Soviet Union. The Soviet government's distrust and fear of Britain and the United States will also be explained, involving the truth about British and American relations with the Soviet Union, which is worthy of appreciation. The outline is introduced below:</p>
<p>The author first starts with the industrial strength of the Soviet Union and describes the general situation in the Soviet Union as follows:</p>
<p>The most noteworthy aspect of the industrial development of the Soviet Union is that the Soviet Union has built its own machine tool industry. The reporter would visit the military factories in the Moscow area and between Kuibyshev and the Urals. Most of the machine tools were self-made, and very few were made in the United States. When the German-Soviet war broke out, there were only four factories in the Soviet Union that manufactured fighter planes. Now there are six to eight. Since the outbreak of the war, military factories in Moscow, Kiev, Kharkov and other places have begun to move to the new industrial center in the Urals. The trains transporting factory equipment to the Ural Mountains stretched for dozens of miles, which was extremely grand.</p>
<p>Although the Ural region has become an industrial area, its full picture is still unclear. However, in the reporter's opinion, the weapons and materials used in the Moscow defense battle in the autumn of 1941 were completely made in the Soviet Union. In the early stages of the war, British-made tanks were used, but soon their firepower was exposed to be extremely weak. From October 1941, the British and American bombers that should have been supplied to the Soviet Union every month were not available until February of the following year. Only a few were seen at the airfield in Iraq four months later.</p>
<p>Wheat is one of the most important materials for aid to the Soviet Union. Since the loss of Ukraine, food was in short supply in 1942. We believe that the Soviet Union's military production capacity cannot be underestimated, so what the Soviet Union urgently needs today is not military supplies but food. Since the Soviet Union concluded an agreement with Britain and the United States on material assistance, the second front has not been successfully opened up, and British politicians are still trying to maintain Britain's leading position. Therefore, the Soviet Union cannot but doubt the ultimate intentions of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Among the officers of the British Army, many believe that Britain must restrain the Soviet Union in the future, just as it is now restraining Germany. The Soviet Union believes that this is an implication of the British authorities' views. In view of the anti-Soviet sentiment among the British military department, the current combat plan is to seek as much aid from Britain as possible on the one hand, and to try to ensure that the country is not limited to the complete exhaustion of national power at the end of the war on the other hand. Therefore, the Soviet Union harbors mistrust of British Conservative politicians and American financial groups.</p>
<p>As for the people's livelihood, although coal is in short supply, so that the people have no heating equipment in winter, the Soviet people are happy to endure this lack of materials and have no complaints.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Two Insurance Companies Falsely Report Capital; Authorities Order Dissolution; Fearing That Other Companies Have the Same Situation; Supervision Bureau is Sending Personnel to Secretly Investigate and Rectify <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Fire and Water Insurance Company and the Overseas Chinese Life Insurance Company were initiated by Lin Mao from Fujian. His wives, concubines, and children served as directors, managers, and the like. There were also one or two other directors and supervisors who were Lin's relatives and friends. The Overseas Chinese Fire and Water Insurance Company claimed to have a capital of 2 million yuan, and the Overseas Chinese Life Insurance Company claimed to have a capital of 1 million yuan, but in fact, no payment had been made.</p>
<p>Obtaining a License by Deception and Diverting Funds for Inspection</p>
<p>In September of last year, they deceptively obtained registration licenses No. 50 and No. 47 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. In October, the Insurance Supervision Bureau was established and repeatedly sent Chang to inspect the property. Lin Mao and others cleverly concealed this by temporarily borrowing funds from the Overseas Chinese Industrial and Commercial Bank, which he was in charge of, depositing them in various banks, and presenting bank remittance receipts and checkbooks for inspection. After the inspection, Lin Mao privately spent the deposits for his own use. Recently, the Supervision Bureau went to the group for detailed investigation. The employees of the two companies were scattered, and no one was in charge. All the books and records were also incomplete. The Supervision Bureau authorities secretly investigated various related banks and learned that the two insurance companies had no capital at all. The previous reports to the Ministry claiming that the capital was not fully collected and the reports to the Bureau on the use of funds were all false.</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Liquidate and Hand Over to the Court for Punishment</p>
<p>The responsibilities of the Supervision Bureau are crucial. The authorities reported the results of the investigation to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval and instructions. Subsequently, they received a reply telegram ordering the dissolution of the companies, sending personnel to liquidate them, and requesting the Ministry of Justice to order the competent court to severely punish them for criminal violations. It is reported that after receiving the order, the Bureau has published an announcement announcing the dissolution of the Overseas Chinese Fire and Water Insurance Company and the Overseas Chinese Life Insurance Company, and has selected a liquidator to begin liquidation. It is also heard that in view of this, the Supervision Bureau is afraid that other companies may have the same situation, and is separately sending personnel to secretly investigate in order to rectify them.</p>
<h3 id="e33">34th Phase of Household Flour: Rice Shops Collect Purchase Orders; Total Number is Less Than Last Time <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, rice shops in the two concessions collected flour warehouse receipts for the 34th phase from the Rice and Flour Distribution Office of the Public Works Department, and then指定 warehouses to ship the goods. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the total number of whole rice and broken rice distributed to each rice shop in the 34th phase is about 43,000 bags, while there are only more than 20,000 bags of flour. This is because the number of household flour in this phase has decreased, and each rice shop has some surplus from previous distributions. It is also learned that there are currently six designated rice shipping warehouses and three flour shipping warehouses.</p>
<p>Gunny Sacks Should Still Be Returned According to Regulations</p>
<p>The Rice and Flour Distribution Office of the Public Works Department has catered to the rice shops' needs for the movement of empty gunny sacks without the need for transportation permits. However, each rice shop must still return the gunny sacks to the Rice and Flour Distribution Office of the Public Works Department in accordance with the previous regulations. Rice shops in the two concessions should comply with this and must not hide the gunny sacks.</p>
<p>Citizens in Shanghai West Hope for Flour Distribution</p>
<p>The 11th phase of grain distribution by population at the Public Grain Sale Office in the West Shanghai District began at the end of last month, and citizens in the district were very enthusiastic about collecting grain. The amount of coarse rice distributed in this phase was 1.9 liters, and the price was 5.7 yuan in national currency. It will expire three days later, and the授 will be stopped after the deadline. As this 11th phase of grain distribution is still the second grain distribution in West Shanghai District in April, the third grain distribution in that month is also expected to be allocated in the near future, but the date has not yet been determined. As for the end of February, the 6th计口 flour and the flour collection certificates for March and April, citizens in the West Shanghai District hope that the Public Grain Sale Office will allocate them as soon as possible to benefit the people's livelihood.</p>

However, after sailing out of the pier, the tide was surging and the ship tilted, causing it to capsize. All the passengers fell into the water. Neighboring ships rescued only 200 or so people. It was a tragic event. More details will be explored and reported.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Military Police Corps Cracks Down on Undesirables Impersonating Secret Agents and Extorting Money, Hoping for Cooperation from Chinese and Japanese Citizens to Assist Authorities in Combating This <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai dispatch: Recently in Shanghai, there have frequently been unscrupulous individuals falsely claiming to be secret agents of the military or military police, unjustly coercing innocent Chinese citizens or extorting money, which is utterly illegal. The Japanese Shanghai Military Police Corps, in light of this situation, has launched a severe crackdown and is thoroughly arresting these undesirables to eliminate such illegal behavior. Considering the gravity of these incidents, the Military Police Corps headquarters has issued the following statement, hoping for the united cooperation of the citizens:</p>
<p>Statement from the Japanese Military Police Corps Authorities</p>
<p>The Shanghai Military Police Corps has already issued a warning to both Chinese and Japanese residents, as well as people of third countries, to severely crack down on those unscrupulous individuals who falsely claim to be from the military or military police and extort money from law-abiding citizens. Recently, due to economic problems, there seems to be a sense of unease among some citizens, and these bad elements are exploiting this opportunity, leading to a regrettable increase in criminal cases. These illegal individuals falsely claim to be secret agents of the military or military police, or exploit the military police, to extort money from those who hoard or conceal goods, as well as illegal merchants, and even innocent Chinese citizens.</p>
<p>Numerous Cases in Four Months</p>
<p>From the beginning of this year to the end of April, a total of twenty-seven criminal cases of this nature have been cracked, involving thirty-six criminals, of whom twenty-three were Chinese, and thirteen were Japanese and other nationals. Twelve cases have resulted in prison sentences, five cases were dealt with on the spot, three cases resulted in deportation, and the others are still under serious investigation. Some victims were defrauded of as much as 9,000 US dollars, 35,000 old legal tender, or 11,000 reserve certificates. The Military Police Corps views these unscrupulous individuals as profaning the prestige of the Japanese military and will impose severe punishments without leniency. It hopes that Chinese and Japanese citizens will warn each other and cooperate with the authorities in cracking down on these activities, in order to achieve the goal of building a bright and prosperous Greater Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fabricating Titles and Endangering the People</p>
<p>Furthermore, military personnel and military police, when performing their duties, always carry identification cards or service record books. Not only do they not demand money or goods, but they also absolutely avoid coercive words or actions. Therefore, if anyone discovers someone fabricating the title of military police or secret agent of the military police and engaging in illegal activities, they should immediately report it to the nearest military police station for arrest.</p>
<p>Common Types of Crimes</p>
<p>According to the investigation, the more serious cases include: (1) A Dutch woman residing in the French Concession hid over 500,000 yuan worth of undeclared precious metals. These individuals learned of this and, falsely claiming to be members of the military police, coerced her and forcibly seized twenty-five kinds of precious metals. The criminals have been arrested and sentenced to one year in prison. (2) Chen Afang was suspected of stealing cotton and was also defrauded of 1,000 yuan using the name of the military police. In addition, an old lumber merchant was also coerced into giving up 80 yuan. (3) An unscrupulous individual, claiming to be a secret agent of the military police in a tea house, said that if he was given 5,000 yuan for "expenses," he could have those who had been arrested released. (4) Falsely claiming that someone was secretly colluding with guerrillas, they extorted 9,000 US dollars and 35,700 old legal tender on the condition that the person would not be arrested. In summary, it can be seen that these individuals often take advantage of the weaknesses of those involved, seizing the opportunity to coerce and extort money. Such incidents are endless. It is hoped that citizens will understand the authorities' intentions and cooperate to quickly eradicate such evil practices.</p>

<p>Planning to Shelter All Street Beggars</p>
<p>The English-language Times reported that since the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, the authorities of the three municipal districts of this port have repeatedly planned to clear all beggars from the roads. After several months, beggar shelters have been set up in the suburbs, and a large number of charitable organizations related to social welfare have been established. It is now known that the authorities are paying great attention to the beggar problem, as the maintenance of public health and the tidiness of the city depend on the solution to the problem of street beggars. According to estimates from relevant parties, there are more than 50,000 beggars in Shanghai, who often make the roads unclean and spread germs. The authorities are now planning to shelter all of them, teach them work skills and knowledge, and make them respect themselves. It is expected that this plan will be realized soon.</p>

<p>The Zhendan University Scholarship Fund Committee is sponsoring a charity football match for Nanyang students whose sources of economic support have been cut off. It is scheduled to take place today at 4:00 PM at the Zhendan Stadium for the sixth time. Donghua will battle Zhendan United again. Mr. Fabre, Director of the French Concession Police, will kick off the match. The French Concession band will come to the stadium to play. The referee is He Chunhui, and the linesmen are Zhang Le and Chen Jixiang. In light of their defeat in the first match, Donghua is determined to respond with a strong lineup today. Goalkeeper Zhang Banglun and center forward A Dai will be on the field this time. With the addition of Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang, and other famous players who appeared in the last match, their strength has doubled. It was originally planned for the Nanyang star Huang Senlin to appear as a guest left inside forward, but this has now been canceled due to some reason. Zhendan United is also not weak. In addition to the original good players Fu'en, Sun Jinshun, Xu Erz, Yuan Kuntian, etc., they have also invited two veterans, Huang Mao, Robert Stoff, and Qu Lunzifu, to participate in the battle. The lineup is exceptionally neat. The stadium order will be maintained by the Xu Guangqi First Regiment. During the break, charity balls will still be auctioned off.

<h3 id="e50">Economic Circles, Commentary: The Financial World and Industrial Loans <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The normal business of the financial world in the future will be to support productive organizations, in other words, to be the backbone of factories, using most of its strength to help factories strive for production.</p>
<p>The financial world's loans to factories should not be for official purposes, nor should they be based on sentiment. They must be based on actual achievements and only provide loan convenience where it is deemed worthy.</p>
<p>Therefore, thorough investigation, detailed research, and scientific analysis must be conducted beforehand. It must be felt that the factory is worthy of loans in terms of its overall prospects, its structure, and its assets, and then loans should be made. One should never act on temporary emotions, nor should one engage in superficial work to perfunctorily fulfill responsibilities.</p>
<p>In particular, it is important to provide continuous technical guidance after the loan is made. The past practice of not paying attention after the loan has become a thing of the past. In the future, experts must assist factories in research, analysis, examination, and auditing, which is essential. It is best to recruit many engineers to conduct design and research; every factory and every part must rely on the full spirit and strength of engineers to improve. If there is something wrong with every factory and every part, one must study the methods of reform as soon as possible and never be polite or perfunctory. I remember that a manager of a brick and tile factory in Hong Kong asked an electrical engineer to inspect the factory one day and learned that the old belt of the motor was broken, and every action was delayed by several seconds, resulting in a waste of a lot of electricity every month. Later, after the factory replaced the old belt with a new belt through an electrical engineer, it saved more than two thousand seven hundred yuan in electricity costs every month. It can be seen that the importance of the relationship between technology and production is beyond doubt. It is hoped that after the financial world is strict and disciplined, it must pay attention to this kind of scientific production loan.</p>

After the war, the affairs of the three groups were at a standstill. The Revitalization Group, having the largest number of members among the trades, took the lead in reorganizing its business last year, and handled trade regulations. After submitting separate applications to the authorities of both the Liang He Jie (Two Rivers Boundary) and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for approval, the group has now been ordered to reorganize as the "Shanghai Special City Pearl and Jade Industry Trade Association" in accordance with Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations of the Industry and Commerce Trade Association, and has submitted an application to the Bureau of Social Economy for approval and registration.</p>

Those who fail to do so will be deemed unofficial member stores and will be required to cease operations in accordance with the regulations.</p>

At the same time, New Asia Trust Company is also handling the payment of dividends and the issuance of rights certificates for New Asia Enzyme Factory, making it doubly busy.</p>
<p>Smooth Cotton Planting in Central China: The weather has been clear and sunny recently, and the climate is warm, so cotton planting in the Central China area is progressing smoothly. It is reported that the sowing of cotton seeds in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is relatively early, and the rest of the Su, Song, and Tai areas will be sown within this month.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Strengthening the National Government and the Problem of Hoarding (Part Two) <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Reality and Principles: There should be a strict distinction and a clear comparison between the ideals and reality of China's participation in the war. If a gap is found between them, every effort must be made to bridge it in order to make reality conform to the ideals. What is most undesirable is to make compromises with reality. The three principles of Konoe are still regarded by the Japanese people as the basis for their political, economic, and cultural attitude towards China. At the same time, the National Government and its people should, in accordance with the various principles of peaceful nation-building and various ideals of participating in the war, launch a faithful and courageous wartime campaign to conduct a thorough self-criticism. What, then, are the basic principles of China's participation in the war? This is to participate in the Greater East Asia War and make it a national war in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p>What the Japanese people expect of the National Government, national capital, and the Chinese people is to promote the national war, that is, to establish a wartime system as soon as possible. The seriousness of the obstruction of the national war by the Chinese political, economic, and ideological reality revealed by hoarding behavior does not need to be explained in detail. In short, anyone who obstructs the promotion of the national war should be held accountable, and even further, such elements should be accused of aiding the enemy and thoroughly eliminated. In the future, the National Government must obtain the strong support and trust of the people in order to promote the national war, but the problem of hoarding is hindering this national war, so it must be thoroughly resolved.</p>
<p>Under China's participation in the war, everything in politics, economy, and ideology has been distorted by the hoarding incident, thus distorting the morality of participating in the war. Therefore, hoarding is hated by the Chinese people and also hated by the Japanese people. The Japanese national war and the Chinese national war are national wars that stand in a relationship of life and death and seek victory in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we strongly advocate that the problem of hoarding, which undermines the livelihood of the Chinese people and makes other conditions for participating in the war unstable, must be eradicated.</p>
<p>New Economic Policy and the Problem of Hoarding: At any time and in any country, the problem of hoarding has a serious impact on the people of the country. After China's participation in the war, and at the beginning of its departure towards a new economic policy, the facts of this problem must be taken seriously. Only by thoroughly eliminating hoarding can the first step of faithfully implementing the new economic policy be taken. This is by no means an exaggerated statement.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the political and economic power of the National Government under participation in the war, it is necessary to mobilize Chinese national capital in the material and economic policies of Central China to give play to its autonomy and creativity, so as to make Central China a logistics base for completing the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, with the entire national capital and the entire Chinese people as the targets, the aim is to promote the establishment of a wartime national economy in China.</p>
<p>The National Government and the Chinese people also cooperated with the Japanese side in the conversion of economic policies, and first established the National Commercial Control Association. More than twenty days later, the problem of hoarding turned into a political problem. Not only the Chinese people attach importance to it, but also the Japanese people attach great importance to this point. In order to implement the new policy and strengthen the efforts of the National Government, three necessary conditions must be paid attention to when promoting the new economic policy:</p>
<p>First: The new economic policy of the entire National Government and the entire national capital must cooperate strongly.</p>
<p>Second: The cooperation of the National Government internally with the new economic policy must be strong.</p>
<p>Third: The mutual support of national capital for the new economic policy must be strong.</p>
<p>If the above three conditions cannot be achieved, then the new economic policy will become empty talk. At the same time, the problem of hoarding must be solved in order to achieve the above objectives. Therefore, we hope with all our hearts that it can be thoroughly solved.
