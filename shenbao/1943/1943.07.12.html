<p>社評</p>
<h3>三獻言於友邦經濟使節團</h3>
<p>友邦日本經濟使節團抵滬四日，備受上海紗濟界的歡迎。在每一個歡迎席上，主賓都有極懇摯，極眞　的演說，在我們則藉此機會盡情披露一般人民的意見，在友邦經濟使節團則藉此機會完全得到中國人士之眞情表示，無　的雙方都可以感到異常的愉快。</p>
<p>過去數日中，本報曾一再貢獻若干誠摯的意見；以不負使節團諸君遠來的盛意，最後一次，並曾　出安　金融和　決民的兩項具體意見。我們所以首先提出這兩點的意思，是因爲這兩點都是先決問題，如果不　解決，其他一切問題，皆無從談起。今天我們所要繼續提出，雖然祇有一個問題，可是對於中日經濟提携是有極端重要性的。提携的意義，是雙方都有經濟自主的力量，然後可以通有無緩急，倘使一方經濟不能自立，對於他方祇有倚賴，祇有負累，決談不到提携。</p>
<p>中國向來是一個生產落後的國家，無論　業工業，都極落後。戰時的生活，愈形衰落，要想與日本經濟提携，必須先樹立經濟基礎，而樹經濟基礎，則必須充實生產能力，所以我們今日想貢獻一點對　增加生產的意見。</p>
<p>增加生產，在戰時爲平抑物價，安定民生的根本辦法，也是施行物資統制的先決條件；假使增加生產做不到，即物價無由平抑，統制無從進行，進一步言，亦即民生絕對無法安定。增加生產問題，雖已由政府在戰時經濟政策綱領中明確規定，然而事實上的表現，至今絲毫未見端倪。以工業言，中國工業之中心在上海，增加工業生產，常然先從上海做起，可是綜合一方調查報吿，上海各項重要民生工業的開工率，都見减低，（紡織業四成，榨油業五成，染織業三成。）其原因不外下列三點：（一）原料缺乏，（二）原動力不足，（三）工人食糧問題發生困難。原料缺乏的原因，　產品减少固爲戰時各國一般的現象，可是在中國方面，還有許多人爲的原因在內，而且這種人爲的原因，還不能不負相當責任。第一是地域經濟觀念始終未能打破，商人到各地採辦原料，往往遇到意外的麻煩，以致由疑慮而畏懼，終則裏足不前。第二是收購的方式不適當，收購的價格不合理，逼得農民不得不採用消極抵抗方法。如棉花之自行紡織土布，如菜子之自行榨油，已成爲各地農村普遍之現象。第三是運輸困難，各地雖有工業原料，但無法轉運至加工地點，或雖可轉運，而廢時甚久。以上三項，皆爲工業原料業源短少之主要原因，尤其收購方式，如強迫收購，如收購格不願成本，倘不從速研究改善，誠恐工業原料，更不免有從日趨短少而終歸於斷絕之一日。蓋自今春以來，農民鍳於棉花收購係用强制方式，棉花定價遠在成本以下，多有剷去已種棉而改種他項作物者，故各力佔計今年　產將較去年减少三成，假使以往之辦法不變，明年棉田面積將比今年更見减少，可以斷言。原動力問題，關係煤斤來源，倘使煤斤來源短少，甚至無法維持，一般嚴格限制用電，自屬必要，不過即使在這種塲合之下，對於工業用電，還應該特別考慮。何况根據過去事實，煤斤之產運都還未發生問題，即以上海一埠而論，日商華商存煤尙達五十餘萬噸之多，限制工業用電，似尙非其時。退一步言，就使限制用電，爲節省用煤的一種事先措置，亦應先從娛樂塲所，旅館，商店，餐館，家庭用電入手，不應貿然即限制生產者之用電。試觀上海今日之現象，一方則娛樂塲所城開不夜，紙醉金迷，一方則各項生產機關，羣以動力受嚴格之限制，不得不緊縮生產，局部開工。從增加戰時生產言，從繁榮東亞言，均爲不合理的現象。至如工人食粉間題，驟視之似尙不關重輕，但以吾人所知，確有許多工廠，以工人食米問題無法解決，不得不力事緊縮，暫維現狀。蘇聯施行五年計劃之際，爲謀增加生產起見，對於工人食物之配給，質量皆視一般民衆爲優厚。工人是生產主要份子，在此極力提倡增加生產的時期，對於工人食糧的特別配給，不容不普遍的加以考慮。</p>
<p>再談農業增產，自從中日事變以來，六年之中，農產品的價格雖然逐步增高，可是農民的經濟狀况，却祇有愈見惡劣。因爲農民的收入雖然增加，但與支出增加的程度比較，則不逮遠甚，故目前一般農村現象，皆爲耕牛不足，農具不全，水利不講，在這種現象之下，欲求農業增產，爲絕不可能的事。對症下藥，第一要政治修明，官吏廉潔，不使農民於正賦之外，有絲毫之額外負担，假使政府要將田賦改微實物的話，（蘇淮行政區已實行兩年）其折合數目亦應顧到農民負担力量，及農作品生產成本，斷斷不可以改徵實物爲名，而暗行加賦之實。第二，吾國農村經濟狀况向極惡劣，過去農民生產費用，大都倚賴高利貸以資周轉，事變以還，農村間資產階層多數遷往都市，山於投機囤積暴利之誘惑，由於農村秩序不安定，對於農民貸款太無保障，於是農民雖欲求如以往之高利貸而不可得。故目前首要之圖，應先恢複各地農民金融機關，分別舉辦長期，中期，短期，低利貸款，俾農民得以整理耕地，興辦水利，補充耕牛與農具，或作耕種及收穫期間之工資開支。第三，刺激農業生產的方法，當使農民於生產成本之外，仍能得到相當利潤。過去收購農產品價格，皆失之對於農民生產成本毫不顧及，中國有一句話：「榖貴傷民，穀賤傷農。」傷民固屬不可，傷農則其危險性更大。何况中國的人民百分之八十是從事農業的，萬一弄到此百分之八十的農業生產者，都陷於無力繼續生產的地步，其他百分之二十，又豈能徼倖獨存，事理至明，無待深論。最近有一個顯著的實例，浦東農民因棉花定價太低，不敷生產成本，紛紛改變種稻，又以種稻的利益，還趕不上種豆，於是未種稻者復羣趨於種豆，這固然是農民知識簡單，不知道經濟原理，和統制趨勢，祇看到眼前米價豆價之高，而未想到米價豆價會因供求的關係而下跌，和米豆一樣將受統制限價的支配。可是價格足以影響生產，於此已成鐵證。我們並非一定要求提高農產品價格，但不能不要求顧及農民生產成本，和相當利潤，假使一定要農民以低過其生產成本的價格，出售共終歲辛勤唯一取益的農產品，而以幾培的價格換入其日用必需品，換言之，即工業品的定價不能與農產品定價相配合。其結果，祇有　使農民除了本身和家庭所必需以外，絕對不再多事生產，這簡直是同歸於盡的辦法。</p>

<h3>西西里島東南海岸　激烈戰鬥進行中　義轟炸反軸心運輸艦隊</h3>
<p>百倫十一日中央社電　此間昨晚接獲最近消息，反軸心傘兵曾在西西里之東南部降落，已遭軸心軍解決，　該島西部之馬沙拉與費托角間及該島東海岸之喀塔尼亞與　拉古間，有激烈戰鬥。馬沙拉爲該島極西部地方，而費拉角則位於東南約二十英里，叙拉古距喀塔尼亞之南約四十英里。據首次傳來消息，反軸心軍係在東南部海岸登陸，但柏林方而引倫敦消息謂，反軸心軍亦曾在四岸登陸，其地點係在馬沙拉與費托角之間，該處德·義空軍曾以有力部隊截擊。又　柏林軍界稱：軸心軍海岸砲隊及轟炸機會擊沉載有軍隊及軍用品之運輸　及登陸船數艘。</p>
<p>羅馬十一中央社電　蓋達今晨在義大利呼聲報著論謂，反軸心軍在西西登陸之初步行動，已遇軸心軍之迅速抵抗而吿失敗，蓋達謂，在若干處之敵軍已遭包圍而加心殲滅，首先企圖登陸之敵軍一隊，亦被義海空軍所殲滅，又稱：西西里之戰爭乃歐洲文化之發源地及其歷史之最　決定點，義大利深知此次戰爭關係將來之世界及戰局之發展至鉅，反軸心軍稱西西里戰事爲第二戰綫，惟事實上並不影響　第一戰綫之作戰，斯達林在東綫發動大規模戰爭後，其最後及急進之要求，卒使英·美採取行動。</p>
<p>羅馬十一日中央社電　　通社訊，反軸心軍進攻西西里島，已引起軸心國空軍加緊轟炸該島南面之反軸心軍運輸艦隊，羅馬電台昨夜宣稱：有滿裝軍需之敵運輸艦一艘，正向東北方面行駛，後在突尼西亞沿海附近被義魚雷機投魚雷命中，另一架義魚雷機亦在加德角西北擊中敵運輸艦一艘，弗拉特洋面亦有敵船二艘中彈。</p>
<p>羅馬十一日中央社電　據今日公布，上週一週間，反軸心空軍在地中海損失飛機二百五十三架。另有運輸船五艘被擊沉，又有其他一艘亦可列爲沉失。七月三日至五日三日間，西西里島上空敵機被　落者達一百五十　。</p>
<p>島上德義守軍約達四十萬人</p>
<p>百倫十一日中央社電　阿爾及爾無綫電昨晚播送北非反軸心軍總計公　謂，反軸心軍於昨日破曉前之不良天氣中，在西西里島登陸，首次進攻時的利用之海灘及登陸地點，長約一百英里，參與　戰部隊計有美·英·印·荷·波·希各國海軍。英海軍担任運輸軍隊至西西里，並保衛通至非州根據地之供應綫。又據艾森霍華總部傳來消息稱：反軸心軍係向該島西部作主力攻擊，並指出該島軸心軍在過去數日間曾獲得增援，据悉，該島係由古索尼將軍的統卒之義第六軍防守，實大約有三十萬人，此外並有德軍十萬人。華盛頓昨晚所接消息，承認軸心軍猛烈反攻，並揣測反軸心軍將否認試行　撒丁及科西嘉登陸，以期自軍事根據地里飛機對義大利之西部及中部抄擊。又路透社，吿反軸心謂，進攻西西里之部隊，必須準備作長期之苦鬥，蓋所有糧食及彈藥，皆須由海軍在無掩護之海灘運至陸上，日該島地勢多山，亦爲進攻部隊之一大障碍。</p>
<h3>義斯蒂芬尼社抨擊英美宣傳</h3>
<p>羅馬十一日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社昨晚發表一文，暴露英·美對義大利之宣傳策，略謂：反軸心對於西西里登陸事件所散播兩种消息，値得吾人之特殊批評，第一　電訊內稱：「英，美軍隊已在距羅馬二九零哩　處登陸」，此項電訊之目的，無疑係在引起英·美民眾之熱烈情緒。英·美方面以爲，如此宣傳其軍隊在歐登陸，已在距羅馬二日餘哩之處實行，將可使英·美國內之不甚熟悉地理者，爲之迷惑，實則，軸心軍之登陸地點，係在西西里東南區域，換言之，即在島上，而非在大陸也。至於所稱登陸之處距羅馬二九零哩一節，則無非刺激民眾，使彼等相信羅馬將在數日之內可聞英·美之砲聲而已。另一種宣傳企圖，是係昨日午後路透社所發出之電訊，其所　明之發電地點爲「西西里內地之某處」，英方之採取此種手段，無非欲在軍事行動發端之時，振作民眾之樂觀，以軸心軍企圖成立橋頭堡，以增强其對西西時之攻勢，已經歷种困難，反軸心之抵抗與反攻，現正在充分發展中，反軸心軍之處境困難勢將與時俱進。</p>
<h3>華北糧食對策　日方决予協力　日鹽澤公使在平談話</h3>
<p>北　十一日中央社電　新任華北物資物價委員會委員長王克敏氏，十日就華北食糧問題，曾表示將努力籌謀解決方法，日本駐北京公使鹽澤氏，同日亦發表談話謂，日方願更加强對華北物價食　對策之恊力，其大意謂華北政務委員會王委員長當就任之原，已力言華北負有大東亞戰爭後方之重大使命，又就增强物資物價之統制，積極推進食糧政策二點，披瀝其決心，并闡明誓在堅固之決意下奮力推進，余對此深表讚同。最近華北食糧價格頓吿低落，一般物價亦有逐漸低落之傾向，此蓋由於中國方面之措置得當所致，良足滿意，日方對於華北政務委員會之物價對策等，從來即竭力恊助，茲者，委員長又有此項聲明錶明，將由各方面加强恊力日方，故深　中日商民能瞭解王委員長之熱忱，此後並加黽勉恊力。</p>
<h3>土叙邊境再度封鎖</h3>
<p>斯丹埠十一日中央社電　可靠方面傳，土耳其，叙利亞邊境已於八日由叙利亞方面再　封鎖，　料其原因當爲有軍隊調動。</p>
<h3>西西里地勢概述</h3>
<p>羅馬十一日中央社電　西西里島面積共二五四六一平方公里，全部海岸綫長達一一一五公里，沿海凹進之　多在北部，海岸內有深大海　半島及良好之天然港，惟泰倫尼亞海與撒　一日在軸心軍之手，反軸心軍即不能利用此海岸爲登陸地點。該處海灣之水甚淺，海岸之　多屬沙堤與石巌，在上述情形之下，唯有西西里東海岸在軍事上可利用之　登陸地點，而尤以喀塔尼亞南面之一部更爲和便。在喀塔尼亞　南之沿　一段，爲該島唯一可稱爲平原之區域，此喀塔尼亞平原之地位，適間於阿特那火山與伊勃林羣山之中，除此平原外，該島之所有海岸，悉屬坎坷不平，島礁地面海拔在一百公尺以下者，僅佔百分之一五，平均海拔均在四百公尺以上，但在另一方面，該島地面海拔之超過一千公尺者，亦不過百分之六而已，該島最重要之山脈係在東北部，由彭太狄爾法羅至伊摩拉河之間，山嶺起伏，將西西里分爲薩爾索河，並稱爲南伊米拉，全部長度爲一一二公里。此外，島上各河　長逾百公里者，入侵該島者所遭逢之种种困難，　不待言，其唯一可利用之處，即爲東海岸，因駐該島軸心軍之給養，平日皆取道米西那海峽，而在東海岸上陸，故有種種便利登陸之設備可資應用，况在此部份海岸又有阿格斯太與塞拉柯斯兩港，反軸心軍如能得之，必可大有帮助也。至於　該島西部特拉巴尼與馬沙拉兩地間入侵亦屬可能，惟欲如此，必須先　取伊格迪羣島之全部，以免後方感受威脅，按此部份共有三港，即特拉巴尼，馬沙拉與馬柴拉是也。</p>
<h3>鎭江淸鄉地區　掉換舊幣二月</h3>

<p>南京十一日中央社電　渝方自第三國際解　後，對於中國共產黨之動向，　爲注意。渝國防最高委員會最近曾派張冲　　若周恩來　赴延安，向朱德德治東林　涵等中共高級幹部，說明蘇聯既已解散第三國際，則中共必須爲專心努力於祖國之團結，同時并向中共中央部提出下列要求：（一）陝甘寗邊區及其他各省區之中共政治組織，一律解散而交　渝方。（二）撤消中共革命軍事委員會，　第十八集團軍及其所屬之各部隊，由渝國防最高委員會指揮，並令其移駐其他地區，而由渝直系軍進駐陝甘寗邊區，至於渝方并決定加中共方面容納此項要求，則可在渝國防最高委員及其他渝方各部門內，予中共高級幹部以適當之政治地位，并在陝甘寗三省任命中共要員三人爲各該省政府委員，並　其參與對轄區之措　及　於西北開發問題，　　并保證第十八集團軍及衛屬部隊之　　　渝　　　　　　　云，但渝方之此種要求，無異澈底　共，預料中共方面決不輕易接受，故此事之發展如何，頗堪注目。</p>

<p>白茅報告文學練習生  未文　　皮帶，輪盤，　　色的機器，白色的紗，布，梭子，紓管…。　　一切充斥着的是聲與力；旋轉，帶動，碰擊…交錯着的是各類的機械運轉的姿勢。　　四十匹怪獸發狂地拖長它們的咆哮。像機關槍的連續的劈拍聲，像坦克車沉重的咻喘聲。像聶炸機隱約的隆隆聲，震撼了這整個的暗濕的究竟，湊成了一隻雜亂的交響曲，沒有旋律，沒有節奏。—這巨大的響聲，一直從裕新織布廠傳揚開來，傳到馬路的遠處去。　　其實，不斷地咆哮着的四十台織布機，不過是裕新織布廠全部布機的五分之一的數目罷了，那其餘的五分之四正受了一個不幸的命運，無聲息地蹲在塲房的後半部裏，停止了工作。遠望去，該以爲那是一叢叢黑色的墳丘。　　男女工人們忙碌地在運轉着的織布機前工作闐，一張張是拉緊了神色的茶色的臉，都沒有一句說話。他們的工作是機械的，呆板的，永遠做着那幾樣技術上僅有的動作。　　然而，在這當中，姚阿福這才十四歲的孩子却是例外。　　他的工作與別人的不同，獨個兒，他躱在那停歇了工作的布機中間，裝卸着機器零件，替牠們揩去灰塵及油垢，一件件的機械，拆着裝着，他默默地，寂寞地，埋着一雙缺乏光采的眼睛，呆呆地地灰黯的四周中摸索那些沉重的鐵塊。　　他的耳際是一片麻木，一片　亂…。　　偶然他抬起一下頭，向那前方中咆哮着的怪獸眺望，可是立刻將他的頭轉了過來。他輕微地嘆了一口氣—雖然還才是十四歲的孩子，却也學　會哀愁了—在喉間迸出這末一句話：「五年了，這些東西和我在一塊兒」。　　這聲音是低微而　啞　　　阿福　　子多少是有點神經質的，當他想到五年來的一切遭遇，他就不禁想哭起來。　　　日　夜的牛馬工作，已是拖廢了這正在發育着的孩子　的身體，然而，在五年來「練習生」的名義下所得的報酬是什麽呢？祇不過換來三頓薄粥。十六元一月的津貼罷了，　　…他永遠祇埋怨着自己的命運。　　他那贏瘦的身子被一件油膩染汚了的工衣包裹着，時常發出一陣惡劣的油臭。他感到眼前是一片錯花，他支持了一隻疲憊不堪的身子，傴僂了腰，垂下頭。　　塲房的窗外透過黃昏的斜照，貼在這可憐的孩子的背上。他望着自己慘淡的陰影，正追尋着那昔日許多甜美的囘憶。　　忽然，一聲粗暴的，像狼嗥般的　　，將他從甜美的囘憶中驚醒，他抬起驚惶失措的眼來，全身突然痙攣地震慄了。那是一雙閃着兇暴的惡光的眼，那面孔上却隱藏了一個陰森的冷笑。　　「哼，昨日晚上做賊骨頭去了。今朝來補瞌睡！」　　姚阿福慌忙立起來，作了一個無可奈何的立正姿勢，在黑暗中一聲不響地低下頭。　　「小鬼！死人，我的話你沒聽見嗎？」　　「劈呀」的一記耳光，打得姚阿福火光都冒出來。　　這是爲了什麽嗎？他想反抗，然而舉在面前的是一隻粗壯的毛手，它發揮着一樣威脅的力量。　　「金先生，我並沒有打瞌睡呀。」顫抖着說。　　「你還賴！」於是又是一記耳巴子。打得他沒有說話的餘地。「剛才是鬼在打瞌睡？」　　「不…。」　　「還賴？」這囘是脚踢了，「睡了嗎？狗娘養的！」　　「啊！…金先生，下次不敢了，饒了我吧！」　　「婚約！我饒你，機器饒不得你！像你這樣的死人一天到晚打瞌睡，機器會打死你的！…哼，告訴你說你得放明白點。做賊骨頭就不要想在我這里吃飯！」　　監工金先生拖着那魁偉的軀體洋洋走了。姚阿福摸着自己泛着微紅的雙頰，感到一層莫名的悲哀與雜堪，望着那搖過去的巨大的影子，驀然添了一陣寒慄。　　在他腦子里突然意識到金先生最後的一句話：賊骨頭！起先，他有些懷疑。後來，就簡直憤怒了，這是什麽意思呢？　　「這是欺侮！」從心底他這樣喊着。　　幾次，他想衝上去，同他申辯。幾次，他都胆怯地缩囘来，不过，後来他终於跑上去了。　　可憐这还不懂得「人情世故」，还不懂得　媚主人的孩子终於吃虧了。那監工巨大的巴掌，兩點似的打在他頭上，一張惱羞成怒的猙獰的紫紅面孔粗暴地吆喝：　　「老子罵你了！老子罵你了！你這狗。滾你媽的蛋！」你被他的巨掌推倒在地上，挨在地上呻吟着。　　「把他關到黑房里去，餓他媽的三天，看老子把顏色他看。」監工對幾個年壯的工人說。　　「不，金先生，你不能關我！你饒了我吧！」姚阿福然突呌起來。他意識到這是一個厄運將帶來他的是禁閉的寂寞與黑暗里的飢餓。　　然而囘答的是無聲的冷笑…。　　於是，他被拖出去了，工塲里，剩下男女工人們投着一些驚詫或是同情的各種眼光。皮帶，輪盤…仍然在飛舞着，嘶吼着。　　太陽沉下去。黑夜籠罩了整個世界，籠罩了那立矗着數排黑色的烟囪的裕新織布廠。工廠已經停工了它底喘息。在迷茫的夜霧中靜默着。　　「媽呀！」終於迸出了一聲呼喊，擊破了一間小黑房的沉悶的空氣，姚阿福躺在角落里，摸索着那冰硬的水門汀地板，摸糊的月光從板壁的方洞中洩進來。他突然想到媽已經是去世五年了。五年，多快的日子啊。「吧呀，你怎麽知道你孤苦孩子的，正挨受着別人的欺侮啊！「在黑暗中，姚阿福絕望地呻吟着。　　他周身感到的是疼痛，寒冷，飢餓…。　　紛亂的念頭孩子的心靈里，突然，他奇快地想到了死。　　「活在這世界上有什麽意思呢？祇不過更多受些他們的磨折罷了。」　　摸索身上的傷痕，　着這已經頹廢了的體軀，他益發加强了死的意志。　　於是，就在一根結了環的褲帶下，遲疑地，顫慄地，悲哀地，結束了自己弱小的生命。　　當太陽剛露出一點芒刺，都市還沒沉在睡夢中的時候，裕新織布廠首先拉起了尖笛聲，衝破了靜謐的魚肚色的天空。　　四十匹怪獸仍然發狂地拖長它們的咆哮，湊成了一隻雜亂的交響曲，這巨大的聲音從裕新織布廠傳揚開來，一直傳到馬路的遠處去。我們前面的路  稀薔　　天空是茫茫的大霧，　　迷住了我們前面的路　　迷途的路，　　叢生着野草荊棘；　　路的西周，　　更有毒蛇猛獸；　　但是我們；　　莫糊塗；　　莫怕苦；　　莫畏懼；　　更要仔細認淸楚，　　慢慢地；　　勇敢地；　　尋向我們前面的路　　淅淅瀝瀝的細雨下着　　前面又有一堵大城墻　　城門緊閉着，　　高高的城墻，　　危我們如何通過；　　同志們！　　赤脚吧！　　莫餒氣；　　前面更有我們偉大的路。　　啊！前面是一條大河，　　風聲呼呼如虎嘯；　　波浪滔滔翻得天般高；　　啊！你瞧；　　前面河中的一只小划舟，　　任風呼喚；　　多麽危險；　　但是我們不渡河，　　怎能走前面的路，　　同志！　　這是我們最後的一段路，　　現在便是千鈞一髪的時候；　　呵：前面飄來一排深木，　　它能夠渡我們過河，　　大家同心協力；　　趕快些！　　勇敢些！　　去吧！　　渡過這一條河。一個小問題  平則　　新文學運動不是有句口號，叫做不用「古典」？文學屬於大眾，爲大眾，不是某些人擺的玄妙空中樓台。擺了一個「典」往往使讀者不解其中所包含意見，這早爲現代一般作家讚揚採納。　　但有些文章與古曲典同樣使人頭痛。—文章裏而夾着外國文字，如T君W君·Y先生。這還好，讀過一二年英文使懂得。新近在一些雜誌上看到如：「我沿着××路的人行道走。」他寫着：「我沿着××路的Side　Walk走。」「我帶着疲勞的身子囘到旅館裏。」寫着：「我帶疲勞的身子囘到Hltel裏。」在茅盾先生早時作品裏，不知「詩與散文」還是「創造」裏也可寫女子是感情主義者。」他寫着：「女子是Sentimentalist。」　　像這裏沿着Side　Ｗalk不是有個「人行道」好好在着。Hotel不是好好旅館在着，Sentimentalist不是可以寫作感情主義者重情主義者？　　現在有些作家（多數係靑年作家。）允喜把外國文字嵌入作品裏面，作爲時髦。藝術，如艷婦賣弄風情。但文章不是譯文，人名，專門名字同時可以用本國文字，夾着的外文就失去其價値，讀者讀文章，當然不是讀外文。　　並且不讀外文的見到就糟了，如不知「古典」的遇到「古典」一樣，只有搖首嘆息。所以濫用外文的作家，要顧一顧本身的價値，同時顧到讀者，大眾的利益，便利。貧病救濟協會（續）收支報吿　　此外尚有經該會議決貸款移作補助及按月補助應付未付項下計有　敎施粥廠十二萬元，上海仁濟善堂所屬（一）育嬰堂部份三千六百元（二）給藥部份二萬元，共計撥付補助費五十萬零一千二百元，關支補助費一百零五萬七千四百三十一元〇二分，合計一百五十五萬八千六百三十一元二分。　　現在百物價格，較之兩月以前，尤爲高漲，生活愈形艱楞，本市各善　所辦收容敎養等機關，難胞眾多，嗷嗷待哺，甚至有斯炊者，待救之急。無異倒懸，深望各業領袖引各界善士，賜捐輸，其善舉，俾該會得　　　辦理補助救濟之工作，則刦後遺黎，庶幾免塡溝壑，救民救國功德寗有量耶。（完）華北急賬捐款徵信錄　第廿一號（續）　各行荘代收捐款　　大陸銀行：　　法商電車公司車務部李國相經募外勤職員同人捐款陸千四百九十七元，鄭效胥·张漢樣·陳金榮，徐星三，北川保夫人，楊鹿　，胥生年，徐寳仁夫人，徐寳仁，江劍秋夫人·江劍秋，中央儲備西區王氏，以上十二戶各　百元，成和山，林莉莉小姐，各一百元，呂濢英二十元，總共計九千一百十七元。　　長城銀行：　　上海特別市紙業同業公會經募，祥興五千元，同興四千元，富豐，仁記各戶三千元，吉昌，德順祥，各二千元，德豐一千五百元，洽和，永安祥，立新，張長豐，以上四戶各一千元，大同，寳隆，周總，怡記，以上四戶各五百元，共計經募二萬六千五百元，總共計二萬六千五百元。　　浙江興業銀行：　　亞細亞保險經理行福利部彩排義演經募振款二萬二千九百六十八元。　　朱象甫經募五千元，大不同二十元，以上共計二萬七千九百八十八元。　　富華銀行：　　無名氏一百元，毛俊卿四十元，張平二十元，以上共計一百六十元。　　紗業銀行：　　　　太一百元。　　中國工業銀行：　　鄭英五十元。　　金康銀行：　　陸德裕五十元。　　中國銀行：　　新新永棉布號三百元。　　五洲銀行：　　方海味五百元，張星橋一百元，務實小學秋五級十元以上共計六百十元　　福錢荘：　　上海特別市理敎會經募浦東理善堂公所，黃鴻發五百元，協興煤號二百元，李福根，孫憲才，殷一仝，各一百元，顧　郎，蔣　軒，殷國正，　寒生，丁螢　，姚　康，　長豐，　雲峰，陳立長，顧靜亞，以上十戶各五十元，趙尚德，吳德全，各四十元，唐萬富，李樹淸，殷祥浪，楊順山，沈順榮，義昌，以上六戶各二十元，陳增濤，張金林，許梅生，陸鳳初，黃祝林，丁雲生，王紀梅，顧承祥，倪祥福，以上九戶各十元，李殿安，任貴，各五元，（共計一千八百元）珠街無名氏一百元，總共計一千九百元。</p>

<h3>Three Pieces of Advice to the Economic Mission of Friendly Nations</h3>
<p>The economic mission of friendly nation Japan arrived in Shanghai on the fourth day and has been warmly welcomed by the textile and economic circles of Shanghai. At each welcoming banquet, both hosts and guests have delivered extremely sincere and genuine speeches. We seize this opportunity to fully express the opinions of the general public, while the economic mission can fully understand the true feelings of the Chinese people. Both sides can feel exceptionally pleased.</p>
<p>In the past few days, this newspaper has repeatedly contributed some sincere opinions, in order to live up to the great kindness of the mission's long journey. In our last piece, we proposed two specific suggestions: securing finance and resolving the people's livelihood. The reason we put these two points forward first is that they are preconditions. If they are not resolved, other issues cannot be discussed. Today, we want to continue to raise only one issue, but it is of extreme importance to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. The meaning of cooperation is that both sides have the power of economic autonomy, and then they can share what they have or lack and respond to emergencies. If one side cannot be economically independent, it can only rely on and burden the other, and there is no cooperation to speak of.</p>
<p>China has always been a country with backward production, whether in agriculture or industry. Wartime life has become even more depressed. To cooperate economically with Japan, we must first establish an economic foundation, and to establish an economic foundation, we must enrich our production capacity. Therefore, today we want to contribute some ideas on how to increase production.</p>
<p>Increasing production is the fundamental way to stabilize prices and secure the people's livelihood during wartime, and it is also a prerequisite for implementing material controls. If increasing production cannot be achieved, prices cannot be stabilized, controls cannot be implemented, and, further, the people's livelihood absolutely cannot be secured. Although the issue of increasing production has been clearly stipulated by the government in its wartime economic policy guidelines, there is still no sign of it in practice. Taking industry as an example, the center of Chinese industry is in Shanghai. Increasing industrial production must start from Shanghai. However, according to a comprehensive survey report, the operating rates of various important industries related to the people's livelihood in Shanghai have all decreased (textile industry 40%, oil extraction industry 50%, dyeing and weaving industry 30%). The reasons are no more than the following three points: (1) shortage of raw materials, (2) insufficient motive power, and (3) difficulty in workers' food supply. The shortage of raw materials, the reduction in production, is a common phenomenon in all countries during wartime, but in China, there are many man-made reasons, and these man-made reasons cannot escape considerable responsibility. First, the concept of regional economy has not been broken, and merchants often encounter unexpected troubles when purchasing raw materials in various places, which leads to suspicion and fear, and ultimately they hesitate to move forward. Second, the method of acquisition is inappropriate, and the price of acquisition is unreasonable, forcing farmers to adopt passive resistance methods. For example, the self-spinning of cotton into homespun cloth, and the self-extraction of oil from rapeseed, have become a common phenomenon in rural areas. Third, transportation is difficult. Although there are industrial raw materials in various places, they cannot be transferred to the processing site, or although they can be transferred, it takes a long time. The above three items are the main reasons for the shortage of industrial raw material sources, especially the method of acquisition, such as compulsory acquisition, such as acquisition prices are unwilling to cost, if not promptly study and improve, I am afraid that industrial raw materials, but also inevitably from the day-to-day reduction and eventually to the day of extinction. Since this spring, farmers have been using compulsory methods for cotton acquisition and the price of cotton is far below cost, and many have removed the cotton that has been planted and replanted other crops. Therefore, the estimated production this year will be 30% less than last year. If the previous method does not change, the cotton field area next year will be even smaller than this year. The problem of motive power is related to the source of coal. If the source of coal is short or even impossible to maintain, it is necessary to strictly limit electricity consumption. However, even in this case, special consideration should be given to industrial electricity consumption. Moreover, according to past facts, the production and transportation of coal have not yet occurred, that is, in Shanghai, Japanese and Chinese merchants have more than 500,000 tons of coal, and it seems that it is not yet time to restrict industrial electricity consumption. Taking a step back, even if restricting electricity consumption is a pre-emptive measure to save coal, it should first start with entertainment venues, hotels, shops, restaurants, and household electricity consumption, and should not rashly restrict the electricity consumption of producers. Look at the phenomenon in Shanghai today, on the one hand, entertainment venues are open all night, intoxicated with luxury, on the other hand, the various production agencies are strictly restricted by the power, and have to tighten production and partial start. From the perspective of increasing wartime production and prosperity in East Asia, both are unreasonable phenomena. As for the issue of workers' food powder, it seems to be not of great importance at first glance, but as we know, there are indeed many factories that have to tighten up and temporarily maintain the status quo because the workers' rice problem cannot be solved. When the Soviet Union implemented the Five-Year Plan, in order to increase production, the allocation of food for workers was more generous in quality than that of the general public. Workers are the main producers. In this period of vigorously promoting increased production, special allocation of food for workers should be given universal consideration.</p>
<p>Let's talk about increasing agricultural production. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, although the prices of agricultural products have gradually increased in the past six years, the economic situation of farmers has only worsened. Because although the income of farmers has increased, it is far less than the increase in expenditure. Therefore, the general phenomenon in rural areas is that there is insufficient plowing cattle, incomplete farm implements, and no attention to water conservancy. Under this phenomenon, it is absolutely impossible to increase agricultural production. To cure the disease, the first is to improve politics and the integrity of officials, so that farmers will not have any additional burden other than the normal tax. If the government wants to change the land tax to in-kind (the Su-Huai administrative region has been implemented for two years), the amount of conversion should also take into account the burden of farmers and the production cost of agricultural products, and it must not be changed to in-kind in name, but secretly increased in fact. Second, the economic situation of rural areas in our country has always been extremely bad. In the past, farmers' production costs mostly relied on usury for turnover. Since the incident, most of the asset class in rural areas has moved to cities, due to the temptation of speculative hoarding and profiteering, and due to the instability of rural order, there is no guarantee for farmers' loans. Therefore, farmers cannot even get the high-interest loans they used to get. Therefore, the most important thing to do at present is to restore the local farmers' financial institutions, and to organize long-term, medium-term, short-term, and low-interest loans, so that farmers can organize arable land, build water conservancy, supplement plowing cattle and farm implements, or make wage expenses during cultivation and harvest. Third, the method of stimulating agricultural production is to enable farmers to obtain considerable profits in addition to production costs. In the past, the prices of agricultural products purchased did not take into account the production costs of farmers at all. There is a saying in China: "High grain prices hurt the people, and low grain prices hurt the farmers." It is not good to hurt the people, but it is even more dangerous to hurt the farmers. What's more, 80% of the Chinese people are engaged in agriculture. If it is made to the point where 80% of agricultural producers are unable to continue production, how can the other 20% be spared? The truth is very clear and does not need to be discussed in depth. Recently, there is a prominent example. Farmers in Pudong have changed to planting rice because the price of cotton is too low and does not cover production costs. Moreover, the benefit of planting rice is not as good as planting soybeans. Therefore, those who have not planted rice have flocked to planting soybeans. This is indeed because farmers have simple knowledge and do not know the economic principles and control trends. They only see the high price of rice and soybeans in front of them, but they have not thought that the price of rice and soybeans will fall due to the relationship between supply and demand, and that rice and soybeans will be subject to the control and price control. However, prices are enough to affect production, which has become a solid proof. We are not necessarily demanding to increase the price of agricultural products, but we must not fail to take into account the production costs and considerable profits of farmers. If we must force farmers to sell their agricultural products, which are the only benefits of their hard work throughout the year, at prices lower than their production costs, and exchange them for their daily necessities at several times the price, in other words, the pricing of industrial products cannot be matched with the pricing of agricultural products. The result is that farmers will absolutely no longer produce more than what is necessary for themselves and their families. This is simply a way to perish together.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Southeastern Coast of Sicily: Italian Bombing of Anti-Axis Transport Fleets</h3>
<p>London, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) Recent news received here last night stated that anti-Axis paratroopers had landed in southeastern Sicily and had been dealt with by Axis forces. Fierce fighting is taking place between Marsala and Cape Feto in the west of the island, and between Catania and Syracuse on the east coast. Marsala is the westernmost part of the island, while Cape Feto is located about twenty miles to the southeast. Syracuse is located about forty miles south of Catania. According to initial reports, anti-Axis forces landed on the southeastern coast, but Berlin quoted London as saying that anti-Axis forces had also landed on the four coasts, between Marsala and Cape Feto, where German and Italian air forces had intercepted with powerful forces. Berlin military circles also claimed that Axis coastal artillery and bombers sank several transport ships and landing craft carrying troops and military supplies.</p>
<p>Rome, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) Guetta commented in the Italian Voice newspaper this morning that the initial actions of the anti-Axis landing in Sicily had failed due to the rapid resistance of the Axis forces. Guetta said that in some places, enemy troops had been surrounded and annihilated, and the first team of enemy troops attempting to land had also been annihilated by the Italian naval and air forces. He also said that the war in Sicily is the origin of European culture and the most critical point in its history. Italy is well aware that this war is of great importance to the future world and the development of the war situation. The anti-Axis forces call the Sicilian campaign the second front, but in fact it does not affect the operations of the first front. Stalin's large-scale war on the eastern front, his final and radical demands, finally led England and the United States to take action.</p>
<p>Rome, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) The anti-Axis forces' attack on Sicily has prompted the Axis air force to intensify its bombing of the anti-Axis transport fleet on the south side of the island. Rome Radio announced last night that an enemy transport ship fully loaded with military supplies was heading northeast and was later hit by a torpedo from an Italian torpedo plane near the coast of Tunisia. Another Italian torpedo plane also hit an enemy transport ship northwest of Cape Guard, and two enemy ships were hit in the Strait of Flate.</p>
<p>Rome, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) According to today's announcement, in one week last week, the anti-Axis air force lost 253 aircraft in the Mediterranean. In addition, five transport ships were sunk, and another one can also be listed as lost. In the three days from July 3rd to 5th, 150 enemy aircraft were shot down over Sicily.</p>
<p>German and Italian troops on the island number about 400,000</p>
<p>London, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) Algiers Radio broadcasted last night the North African anti-Axis forces' general statement that the anti-Axis forces landed on Sicily in bad weather before dawn yesterday. The beaches and landing sites used in the first attack were about 100 miles long. The participating combat troops included the navies of the United States, Britain, India, the Netherlands, Poland, and Greece. The British Navy is responsible for transporting troops to Sicily and protecting the supply line to the African base. According to news from Eisenhower Headquarters, the anti-Axis forces are making a major attack on the western part of the island, and pointed out that the Axis forces on the island have received reinforcements in the past few days. It is reported that the island is defended by the Italian Sixth Army under the command of General Guzzoni, with about 300,000 people, in addition to 100,000 German troops. News received in Washington last night acknowledged the fierce counterattack of the Axis forces and speculated that the anti-Axis forces would deny trying to land on Sardinia and Corsica, in order to launch air raids on western and central Italy from the military base. Reuters also told the anti-Axis forces that the troops attacking Sicily must prepare for a long and arduous struggle, because all food and ammunition must be transported from the navy to the land on unprotected beaches. The island is mostly mountainous, which is also a major obstacle for the attacking forces.</p>
<h3>Italian Stefani Agency Criticizes British and American Propaganda</h3>
<p>Rome, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) Stefani Agency published an article last night exposing the British and American propaganda strategy against Italy, stating that the anti-Axis propaganda about the Sicilian landing event deserves our special criticism. The first telegram stated: "British and American troops have landed 290 miles from Rome." The purpose of this telegram is undoubtedly to arouse the enthusiasm of the British and American people. The British and American side believes that such propaganda that its troops have landed in Europe, 290 miles from Rome, will confuse those in England and the United States who are not very familiar with geography. In fact, the landing site of the Axis forces is in the southeastern region of Sicily, in other words, on the island, not on the mainland. As for the claim that the landing site is 290 miles from Rome, it is nothing more than to stimulate the people to believe that Rome will hear the guns of the British and Americans in a few days. Another propaganda attempt is the telegram issued by Reuters yesterday afternoon, which stated that the place of origin was "somewhere in the interior of Sicily." The British side's adoption of this method is nothing more than to boost the people's optimism at the beginning of the military operation, that the Axis forces' attempt to establish a bridgehead to strengthen its offensive against Sicily has experienced many difficulties, and the anti-Axis resistance and counterattack are now in full swing, and the anti-Axis forces' difficult situation will continue to increase with time.</p>
<h3>North China Food Policy: The Japanese Side Decides to Cooperate: Remarks by Japanese Minister Sawa in Ping</h3>
<p>Peiping, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) Wang Kemin, the newly appointed chairman of the North China Materials and Prices Committee, said on the 10th that he would make efforts to find a solution to the North China food problem. Japanese Minister to Peiping, Sawa, also issued a statement on the same day, saying that the Japanese side is willing to strengthen its cooperation in North China's price and food countermeasures. The general idea is that Chairman Wang of the North China Political Affairs Committee has stated on the origin of his assumption of office that North China bears the important mission of the rear of the Greater East Asia War, and on the two points of strengthening the control of materials and prices and actively promoting the food policy, he has revealed his determination and clarified his determination to strive to promote under a solid determination. I deeply agree with this. Recently, food prices in North China have suddenly fallen, and general prices have also tended to fall gradually, which is due to the proper measures taken by the Chinese side, which is very satisfactory. The Japanese side has always tried its best to assist the North China Political Affairs Committee's price countermeasures, etc. Now, the chairman has made this statement and made it clear that the Japanese side will strengthen its cooperation in various aspects. Therefore, I deeply hope that Chinese and Japanese merchants can understand Chairman Wang's enthusiasm, and in the future, they will work harder to cooperate.</p>

<p>Istanbul, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) According to reliable sources, the Turkish-Syrian border was closed again on the 8th by the Syrian side, and it is expected that the reason is for troop movements.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Terrain of Sicily</h3>
<p>Rome, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) The area of ​​Sicily is 25,461 square kilometers, and the total coastline is 1,115 kilometers. The coast is mostly concave in the north. The coast has deep sea bays, peninsulas, and good natural harbors. However, as long as the Tyrrhenian Sea and Sardinia are in the hands of the Axis forces, the anti-Axis forces cannot use this coast as a landing site. The water in the bay is very shallow, and most of the coast is sandy and rocky. Under the above circumstances, only the east coast of Sicily can be used for military landings, and especially a part of the south of Catania is more convenient. The coastal section south of Catania is the only area that can be called a plain on the island. The position of this Catania plain is located between Mount Etna and the Iblean Mountains. Apart from this plain, all coasts of the island are rugged and uneven. Only 15% of the island's land is below 100 meters above sea level, and the average elevation is above 400 meters. On the other hand, the island's land exceeding 1,000 meters above sea level is only 6%. The most important mountain range on the island is in the northeast, between Punta del Faro and the Imara River. The undulating mountains divide Sicily into the Salso River, also known as South Imara, with a total length of 112 kilometers. In addition, the difficulties encountered by invaders on the island, where the rivers on the island exceed 100 kilometers in length, are self-evident. The only area that can be used is the east coast, because the Axis forces stationed on the island usually take the Strait of Messina for supplies, and land on the east coast, so there are various facilities for landing that can be used. Moreover, there are the two ports of Augusta and Syracuse on this part of the coast, which will be of great help to the anti-Axis forces if they can obtain them. As for the invasion between Trapani and Marsala in the western part of the island, it is also possible, but to do so, the entire Egadi Islands must be taken first to avoid threats to the rear. According to this part, there are three ports in total, namely Trapani, Marsala, and Machera.</p>

<h3>Chongqing's Recent Moves Towards the CCP</h3>
<p>Nanking, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) Since the dissolution of the Third International, Chongqing has been paying close attention to the movements of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chongqing National Defense Supreme Committee recently sent Zhang Chong and Zhou Enlai to Yan'an to explain to senior CCP cadres such as Zhu De, Derzhi Donglin, and Han Han that since the Soviet Union has dissolved the Third International, the CCP must concentrate on uniting the motherland. At the same time, it also made the following requests to the CCP Central Committee: (1) All CCP political organizations in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and other provinces and regions must be dissolved and handed over to Chongqing. (2) The CCP Revolutionary Military Commission will be revoked. The Eighteenth Army Group and its subordinate troops will be commanded by the Chongqing National Defense Supreme Committee and ordered to move to other areas, and the Chongqing direct line army will be stationed in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. As for Chongqing, it has decided to add that if the CCP accepts this request, it can give appropriate political positions to senior CCP cadres in the Chongqing National Defense Supreme Committee and other Chongqing departments, and appoint three key CCP members as government members in the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, and allow them to participate in measures for the jurisdiction and in the northwest development issue, and guarantee that the Eighteenth Army Group and its subordinate troops will be 云，But this kind of request from Chongqing is tantamount to彻底共, and it is expected that the CCP will never accept it easily, so how this matter will develop is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Soong Mei-ling's Remarks</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) According to a United Press International dispatch from Chongqing, after Soong Mei-ling returned to Chongqing on the 4th, she met with the British and American press corps on the 10th and issued a statement. When she took the American plane, it almost landed in Burma under Japanese occupation. The general idea is that the plane we were on lost its way to Calcutta due to bad weather. At that time, the American pilot wanted to land there because he was感 from the radio indicator from the ground, but for some reason, the pilot suddenly changed his landing plan and flew back. After the fact, it was found that the place we wanted to land at that time was a Japanese airfield, so we were all in a cold sweat. If we had really landed at that time, we might have become prisoners of the Japanese army. Also, the plane we were on had almost no gasoline left when it landed in India.</p>

<p>Fierce Fighting in the Kursk Salient Area</p>
<p>German Tank Groups Attack</p>
<p>Stockholm, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the fighting in the Kursk salient area is now intensifying. After German troops used tank groups to penetrate the Soviet positions from several locations, they further expanded from all directions, causing the organized resistance of the Soviet troops defending the outer defensive positions to be unsustainable, gradually leading to a disadvantageous situation. The vanguard units of the German army advanced towards the target day and night, seemingly wanting to advance from Belgorod northeastwards to the central area within Kursk, in order to cut off the retreat route of the main Soviet forces in the Kursk salient. The Soviet troops are currently engaged in large-scale tank battles with the German vanguard units, continuing a seesaw-like fierce battle. Furthermore, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Moscow, Soviet troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat with German troops in the Kursk salient area over the past four hours. A powerful German force even deployed new troops to strengthen the attack, forcing the Soviet troops to retreat to new positions. Another report stated that the Soviet High Command announced on the 10th that fresh troops consisting of ten divisions had been deployed to that area, bringing the total German strength there to forty divisions. At the same time, the Soviet High Command instructed the Soviet soldiers that they must resist the fierce German attacks, and continue to fight to the very last soldier.</p>

<p>Overview of the Zhenjiang Area</p>
<p>The area covers most of Zhenjiang County, the entire Danyang and Yangzhong Counties, and part of Yudu County.

The work of "Purifying the Countryside" within the blockade line is common knowledge. The construction of the blockade line in the area began on March 10 and was completed on April 25 with the mobilization of over 500 people. It is 273 kilometers long and has 37 large checkpoints and 20 small checkpoints. Approximately 7,000 people are working on various tasks within the blockade line, with the assistance of the Japanese army and Chinese troops.</p>

<p>Turkish Ambassador to Japan</p>
<p>Istanbul, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Turkish Foreign Ministry announced on the 9th that it has appointed the former ambassador to Germany, Mr. Gerde, as the ambassador to Japan.</p>
<p>Analysis of the Second Front of the British and Americans</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, which has been fighting hard for two years, has once again called on the British and Americans to open a second front in Die before the new German offensive, but US Secretary of the Navy Knox only responded with perfunctory words. The British and Americans heavily advertised that large German forces were stationed in Italy, but Germany remained silent and the newspapers treated it as a matter of indifference. According to usual practice, it seems that Germany is secretly preparing for a major operation, and now is the calm before the storm.</p>
<p>Goebbels' Views</p>
<p>However, the Der Steermer magazine published a lengthy article by Propaganda Minister Goebbels on the 27th, in which he said:</p>
<p>"The European war situation is now on the eve of a major development. It is foolish to criticize this and that on the stage before the curtain rises. The world's opinion does not know what the British and Americans are going to do, nor does it know what Germany is thinking or doing, and is therefore disturbed. We do not need to talk nonsense in this issue."</p>
<p>He told the people not to fall for the enemy's tricks, but to keep talking and moving towards their goals. He also said:</p>
<p>"If the enemy takes out everything they can think of, the Axis powers will not be able to figure out their movements, because from our point of view, it is not impossible for the enemy to open a second front. We know very well that it is about to be implemented, so we are surprised that the enemy has not opened a second front."</p>
<p>He sharply ridiculed the anti-Axis countries for failing to open a second front, and finally said:</p>
<p>"The question is when and where the enemy will attack the Axis forces. The Axis forces have made full preparations for this and there is nothing to worry about."</p>
<p>Here we can clearly understand that the second front is a reality that is already in front of our eyes, so we have also determined our policy on this. As for its implementation, it is still kept secret. In other words, once the content of the so-called second front is explained, we believe that it will not be a factor in creating unrest in Europe, but rather a concrete plan to defeat the British and Americans.</p>
<p>British and American Troops Will Be Reorganized</p>
<p>It seems very important to examine the recent trends of the British and Americans in the Mediterranean in the context of the second front that is entering a new stage. Since the British and Americans landed in North Africa six months ago, they have been trying to drive the Axis powers out of North Africa. The enemy's organization is also aimed at this. However, observing their actions since occupying Tunisia, it is expected that the British and American forces will be reorganized before landing in Europe in the future. That is, they will first gather strong naval forces in the western Mediterranean under favorable sea control. Judging from the organization of several battleships and aircraft carriers, it is easy to infer that there are many cruisers, destroyers, submarines and aircraft behind them that are responsible for protection. As for the naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean, although there are French-style battleships in Alexandria, their actual combat power is all small warships.</p>
<p>With this superior naval power as the background, a large number of landing craft, weapons, ammunition, and food are transported incessantly, and efforts are being made to increase aircraft in order to reduce landing losses after fierce air raids. It is now claimed that there are several first-line aircraft or more, and the bases on Malta and Pantelleria Island have long been built as bases for protecting fighter jets. As for its replenishment methods, the British and Americans first gather east and west in Gibraltar. From this place, several to dozens of convoys are dispersed to the North African coast day and night. In order to conceal the contents of the freighters, they sometimes sail empty ships and sometimes sail in the opposite direction. According to propaganda by British naval experts, Germany gathered many small boats for landing in England in 1940, and Britain today is preparing boats with even better performance. There are twelve types of these small boats, called flat-bottomed boats, which are equipped with special defensive iron plates to protect the landing. There are also small destroyer-type boats that try to get close to the coast as much as possible and fire mortars or release smoke screens. In addition, the landing craft also have machine gun mounts and group flat boats for transporting tanks. The enemy gathers these small boats from west to east in the Mediterranean, and the corresponding land forces are also working hard to disperse the corps attacking Tunisia in various coastal bases. Judging from the appearance of their preparations, landing in Europe is possible anywhere.</p>
<p>Axis Countries Stand Ready</p>
<p>The call for landing in Europe is becoming more and more loud recently. Even the "Economist" magazine (May 22 issue), which is relatively calm in propaganda, said:</p>
<p>"The Allied Air Force is now carrying out its second front duty, opening a third front based on Tunisia. A landing will definitely take place somewhere in Europe this summer."</p>
<p>In terms of political strategy, George VI is also to be brought to Africa to boost the morale of the Allied forces, and the Battle of Pantelleria Island is being promoted, claiming that taking islands with air power is an unprecedented example in world history. They dream of conquering Sardinia, Sicily, and Corsica Island by the same means. The Axis powers are calmly grasping the reality of the situation, fully aware of the enemy's actions, and establishing their own strategies.</p>
<p>Regarding the joint defense of the Mediterranean, according to a Berlin Trade Newspaper reporter's local inspection report, the defense of Crete Island, which blocks the Aegean Sea, is progressing step by step. The Adriatic Sea is now equal to the Axis countries' inland sea. The problem is the west and south coasts of Italy and the islands. Special performance listening devices called "Uteo Wind" are everywhere along the coast. This is particularly effective for the keen senses of blind soldiers. Train guns are also everywhere, and special countermeasures have been studied against the enemy's parachute troops.</p>
<p>According to other reports, concrete reports show how the joint German-Italian defense of Naples has perfect results. Germany and Italy are now united to defend against the common enemy. According to enemy intelligence, there are three to five divisions of German troops stubbornly resisting on islands such as Sardinia, and seven to ten divisions on Sicily. One division of German troops is responsible for defense, so the enemy themselves say that it is not optimistic. The Axis forces are countering the above-mentioned enemy attack posture with serious military facilities. At the same time, they are judging the enemy's movements and adopting a joint defense posture that adapts to the situation. They are fully aware of the weakness of the enemy's logistical difficulties, so the Axis forces are not taken in by the enemy's empty propaganda. They are calmly judging whether the enemy has sufficient supplies for a counterattack at any time, and when the time is right, they will annihilate them in one fell swoop with a strong spirit of hatred for the enemy.</p>
<p>The Eastern Front Is Still the Center of Gravity</p>
<p>The above is the German view of the second front. Conversely, from the German perspective, their main front is still the Eastern Front, and the principle of defeating the Bolsheviks has never changed. However, due to changes in the internal and external situation, the methods of war in the east have naturally changed somewhat compared to the past two years. Professor Brugmann of the German engineering team was recently awarded a medal by the Führer to reward his military equipment construction efforts in the east. From this point of view, on the one hand, they are building defensive military equipment, and on the other hand, they are strengthening mobile units to wait for an opportunity to annihilate the enemy.</p>
<p>Those who expect the superficial achievements of the Battle of Moscow and the Battle of the Caucasus will be disappointed by the situation on the Eastern Front. The reality is extremely profound. On the one hand, they are preparing a defensive offensive posture, and on the other hand, they are developing the occupied territories to enhance their strength. These two difficult tasks must be carried out simultaneously. From the east and west, this is precisely the character of the new stage of the common world war. In this new stage, the attitude that the Axis forces should take is to regard all enemy propaganda as wind passing by the ear. The only prerequisite is to increase weapons production. The figures released by Munitions Minister Xubeier last time showed that the current stage of the war is proceeding fiercely not only on the battlefield, but also in the domestic production sector.

<p>Rice Shops Ordered to Organize Special Self-Defense Corps</p>
<p>Recently, the Baojia Associations in various districts of this city received orders from the authorities to discover rice shops in their respective jurisdictions and organize special self-defense corps. Since rice shops are an important part of the household rationing system, they have a significant impact on the general public's food supply. Currently, the rice shops have received notices from the Baojia Associations to prepare for organization, with the number of personnel stipulated by the authorities to take turns performing self-defense duties. The special self-defense members are permitted to be filled by the employees hired by the rice shops. All rice shops must comply and report the names and origins of the personnel selected by the rice shops within a deadline set by the Baojia Office.</p>

<p>Negotiate agreements and various handover details.</p>
<p>Fifth Phase of Sugar Rationing</p>
<p>Can Begin in Late July</p>
<p>It was learned from the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Camp Office yesterday by a reporter from the Guofeng News Agency that the fourth phase of sugar rationing in the city has ended, and the fifth phase of sugar rationing will most likely begin in late July. The total amount of sugar rationed by the office in each phase varies slightly due to population changes, but each phase is roughly around 26,400 to 26,500 dan. Sometimes, the population in the concession increases while the population in the city decreases, or even if both increase at the same time, the allocated surplus is supplemented (due to uncollected certificates or expired sugar certificates becoming invalid). It is now heard that the fifth phase of sugar rationing for July should be sold in mid-July according to the previous schedule, but due to the incomplete conclusion of the previous phase and the active preparation for the fifth phase, the official date for the start of sugar sales is expected to be fully available in late July. As for the total amount of sugar sold and the amount allocated per person, there is no change.</p>
<p>Forty-first Phase of Flour</p>
<p>Sales Start Today</p>
<p>The rice shops in the two concessions will start purchasing the forty-first phase of household flour today. One catty of No. 2 flour will be issued with the 41st flour purchase certificate, and the purchase certificate will be sold for six yuan and two jiao. As for the rice purchase certificate used to purchase the 40th phase of household rice, it will only be allowed to be used until 5:00 p.m. on the 14th, and will be invalid after the deadline.</p>
<p>Hospitals Apply for Rationing</p>
<p>Medicines and Supplies</p>
<p>In view of the sharp rise in prices of various medicines, supplies, and patient food in the city, and the difficulty in purchasing them, which greatly hinders the lives of patients, the city's hospitals will study a unified allocation organization through the city's Medical Association in order to ensure the normal supply of medicine and supplies. They are currently applying to the authorities.</p>

<h3>Matsui Iwane-style Speech</h3>
<p>Shonan, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese army General Iwane Matsui recently inspected various places. Since arriving in Shonan, he has met with Japanese military unit commanders and local authorities to discuss the situation in the South. On the 11th, he met with the Shonan press corps and spoke about his impressions of the inspection. He said, "I once came to Shonan on the way to attend the military disarmament conference in Taisho year 8. At that time, I was received by the Governor-General and attended a dinner party at his official residence. Now, as I recall the arrogant attitude of that Governor-General at the time, I cannot help but feel deeply moved. My impression of this inspection is that the unity of the East Asian nations is the current priority.
