<h3 id="c1">期待於棉統會者 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>棉花統制會主任委員一職，已見國民政府明令，以聞蘭亭氏担任，此外中日委員傳亦已內定，預料該會即可在最近期內組織成立，展開收購與配給工作。棉花收穫已久，因係統治物資，在統治機構未組成，收購價格未確定以前，交易完全停頓。鄕農持有棉花，無法易取現金，應付一切開支，其經濟之窘迫固不待言；即廠商方面，因原料無法取給，坐耗資金，其窘迫情形，亦正與鄕農相同。固統治機構之早日成立，與收購配給工作之迅速推行，在鄕農與廠商雙方，均屬迫切期待的。</p>
<p>統治物資的工作有三點：　統治生產，　統治收購，　統治分配。後兩點都是治標的消極的工作，唯有前一點纔是治本的積極地工作。自從全國商統會成立以來，所做的都是治標工作，這固然是由於法律的規定，但是對於治本工作苟不同時並進，則收購配給終必有時而窮。所以，我們希望行將成立的棉統會，在工作範圍尙未確定以前，應該建議政府把統制生產一項，也刻入該會工作範圍以內，使生產·收購·分配·呵成一氣。聯帶我們想到米糧統治會粉麥專業委員會，也同樣的應賦予此項使命。</p>
<p>海通以還，棉製品之進口數字年有增加，晚近十年中，原棉亦有大量輸入，這都可以顯示出我國棉產的不足。棉統會的最重大使命，當積極研究改良棉種，推廣棉田面積，並設法誘導農民接受科學種植施肥方法，增加棉產收穫量，以逐漸塞此漏巵。至如紡織工業亦宜積極提倡科學管理，改良技術，俾成本减低，出品精良，然後方可以頡頏外貨，澈底轉移國人重視舶來品之心理。</p>
<p>棉統會之當前工作，當然屬於收購配給友面，關於這方面，我們也願意貢獻幾</p>
<p>收購價格必需顧忌農民生產成本，加以相當利潤，否則影響於此次收成績向淺，影響於明年之產量更鉅。</p>
<p>收購方式絕對不可利用政治力量，如近來所傳米糧統制會擬利用保甲推動之方式，務須竭力避免。</p>
<p>收購機構應先期組織完成，收媾價款應預爲籌劃充足，價格一經公佈之後，即須着手收買，以免農民迫不及待，徒供中間者之剝削。</p>
<p>應嚴格監督各收購機關，對於品質不得任意壓低，對於分量不得任意尅扣，尤其收貨手續更應簡單敏捷，絕對不可擱壓，致增農民損失，並予辦事人以操縱之機會。</p>
<p>以上爲收購方面應行注意之各點。關於分配方面，據聞此次收購工作，係由紡織同業分別組織機構從事收買，然後由棉統會核准其保留一部份，餘歸統籌配給，那麼各廠爲維持其開工率起見，在收購方面，以多報少之事，恐不能免。爲防止這種現象的發生，棉統會對於收購時之監督，便不能不格外嚴密。對於各廠之生產量，也不能不隨時調查。棉統會是全國商統會下層機構中最後成立的一個，已有許多好的和不好的經騐，可貢參攷。希望棉統會能拾短用長，來健全他的組織，以完成此重大之使命。</p>

<h3 id="c3">大阪懇談會席上　日外相發表演說　闡明大東亞戰必勝理由 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　據大阪電話，日重光外相十五日下午三時在新大阪飯店出席大阪府商工經濟會主辦之懇談會，對日關西經濟界代表等約百人發表演說，闡明大東亞戰爭必勝理由如次：　大東亞戰爭，乃亞洲人防衛鄕土之戰爭·　舉行大東亞會議後，無亞洲即無日本，無日本即無亞洲之信念，今已普及全亞。　大東亞宣言與敵方之各種宣言，其性質大異。　大束亞戰爭乃主張世界公道之戰爭，聽衆極爲感動。重光外相演說要旨如次：</p>
<p>·復興東亞·</p>
<p>亞洲之肥沃土地，多由英美支配，勤勉之亞洲人，在過去亦多呻吟於英美之虐政下，然隨大東亞戰爭之進展，亞洲民族均已覺悟，無不願復與東亞之熱烈決意，茲已奮起決心解放東亞，保衛東亞，團結亞洲之縛力，毀滅敵人，現亞洲已復爲東亞，不再爲英美之殖民地，但英美仍執迷不悟，企圖再度征服亞洲，使亞洲永久化爲彼等之殖民地，恣行其侵略榨取。日本爲使亞洲還亞洲人之亞洲、乃派遣遠征軍往萬里　療之地，然亞洲爲全亞洲人之家鄕，凡言亞洲人均應死守其家鄉，如亞洲失此一戰，則吾人喪失家鄉，故此次戰爭應稱爲亞洲獨立戰爭，吾人猶憶美國爲爭取獨立，曾作七年餘之奮鬥，始掙脫之羈絆，獲得光榮之獨立，故美國之侵略亞洲，實爲否認自己歷史的生命，最後勝利，常與正義不可分，吾人若一翻歷史，追　興旺之原因，則如此爲永久不變之鐵則，最後勝利在吾，其理由亦即基此。</p>
<p>·建設前提·</p>
<p>以言亞洲建設之荊提，厥爲使亞洲安定，故應先保衛東亞，碗立東亞之安定，其次建設工作，應本平等互惠原則進行，大東亞共同宣言，已向全世界宣布，東亞建設之五大綱領，實可謂爲大東亞憲章，因此，凡吾東亞人民，對其無不擁護，東亞各國代表。均以此次熱誠出席大東亞會議，因此共同宣言，得在會議一致贊同聲中通過。大東亞會議，實爲歷史上罕見之盛會，各國代表均充分表明其熱誠。共發言均出肺腑。大東亞會議，實可謂係亞洲之呼聲，亞洲於此一心一德，團結一致，若無日本，則無亞洲，若無亞洲、則無日本，此已成爲全亞洲之强固信念，吾人必可獲得勝利之理亦即在此。大東亞建設綱領第五項表開增厚與萬邦之交誼，取消人種之差別，溝通文化，進而開放資源，以期貢獻世界之發展，此已將吾人之抱負，昭示於天下，幷表明吾人所懷抱之世界和平之經綸。</p>
<p>·開放資源·</p>
<p>吾人所期者，厥在開放全世界人力物力之資源，講通文化宗敎等方面，實現萬邦協和之理想，蓋大道無門，則無從開起，諺云「本無東亞，何有南水」此實爲吾人所堅持開放主義之思想，敵方屢次就戰後經營等發表宣傳性之意見，其多爲掛羊頭賣狗肉，此一視彼等旣往言行之矛盾，即可明瞭參加大東亞會議之各代表所最歡迎者。在宣言之第五項中業已說明，由此而觀，即知東亞指導者之視野，不僅限於東亞，且廣播至整個世界。時至今日，吾人對完成共同戰爭之熱意，已愈益昂揚，最後勝利之理由，即基於此。各國代表之所以共感共鳴者，實爲共同宣言，係立脚於正義之理想，各國代表均能接觸日本之眞姿，得以明瞭日水。</p>
<p>·完成使命·</p>
<p>當會議間各國代表會有以其心悄私吿於余者，蓋使正義發揚光大，此係我國國體之精華，復興東亞。創造東亞之坦途，吾人苟能以百折不撓之信念，與東亞各邦同志相携，勇往邁進，則敵英美雖强，亦必屈服於眞理，而最後勝利，終屬於我，乃屬常然，苦樂相共，休戚相關之東亞十億民衆，爲貫澈同生共死之信念，分担東亞建設之貴托，以血與汗完成此和平之使命，刻正各站在其自身立塲，作勇敢之奮鬥，大東亞共同宣言，即係以大來亞十億民衆之鮮血砌成者，此次會議舉行之際，滴値日軍於南太平洋收獲新的莫大戰果，因之東亞十億民衆之意氣益加激昂，相信大束亞建設，必隨日軍之偉大戰果而着着進展</p>
<h3 id="c4">安達曼選壯丁　組織義勇軍　廿五日舉行編成典禮 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>安達曼十五日中央社電　日本東條首相前於大東亞會議時，曾聲明將安達曼及尼科巴兩羣島劃歸自由印度臨時政府，安達受之住民對此極爲感駕，　該地居民大部之一萬八千印度人尤爲感激，其最初之反響，已有此等印度人十二日之國防獻金。又印度獨立聯盟安達曼支部，十一日在民政部召開會議，已決定於支部長之下組織義勇軍，並已推選委員，負責通行選舉島內各村二十歲至四十歲之精强壯丁。以編成之，並定二十五日舉行編成典禮。</p>

<p>東京十五日中央社電　日情報局情報官井上貞失氏，十五日會見外國記者團，痛詆美國當局之虛僞宣傳稱：美當局在波根維爾島海面慘收後，連日仍在虛僞宣傳，企圖掩蓋世界之耳目，如美海長諾克斯於十二。十三兩日宣稱：「日本發表全屬　唐無稽之宣傳」甚至謂十月六日以來，太平洋方面之美國艦船並未沉沒一艘，此種言詞，均係掩耳盜鈴之舉，徒引起本國民衆及全世界人民對於美國之發表益深疑惑及不信而巳。尤以美政府對於南太平洋波根維兩島海面損折　千數萬美兵，仍故持鎭靜態度，誠可謂毫無良心也。敵之所以出此欺　宣傳者，最大原因係美政府深恐民心弛緩，又美國民現對遣其子弟遠征南太平洋前綫果爲何事，已多懷疑，因而將煽動　戰空氣，其次美政府當局其驚於日本之建設大東亞共榮圈，雖在戰爭期間仍積極推進，尤以此次大束亞共同宣會發表以來，大東亞諸民族對於戰爭目的已經一致，大東亞民族之團結，已成不磨之事實，實使美國深感焦躁，故美政府當局對於眾事失敗，益諱莫如深，庶免引起國民之厭戰空氣也。</p>

<p>略謂，今天是第一次全國衛生行政會議，仰蒙國民政府主席親臨訓話，各院部會長官蒞臨指導，各地醫業專家曁行政常局不　遠而來，可說是還都以來衛生行政界未會有之盛舉，本署成立於參戰體制之下，尤其是在新國民運動促進聲中，仰目中央政府對於衛生行政，要踏入實踐階段，且成為國民總動員中重要工作之一頁，吾輩服務於艱難締造之秋，要負起建設責任，第一項健全行政機構，第二項冤　衛生專款，凡此二者，實為我輩職責之先決問題，所以必須集羣賢於一堂，共商得較有　準之答案，由前兩問題，推而　於其他一切問題，自然能體察顯示，各抒所見，日來瀏覽各方提案，覺得本會議同人對於衛生行政之目標業經一致，再經此次推誠商榷，常有美滿之收穫，今日坐而言，明日起而行，此則本於十分興奮之餘，共向衛生建設之途邁進。</p>

<p>我國代表團團長許力求發　談話如下：此次奉國民政府派遣出席大束亞新聞大會，抵達東京後，目覩盟邦建設的進步，典戰時生活的嚴肅，衷心至感興奮。中日之和平合作，乃至東亞的和平合作，不僅在政府間邦交的敦睦，即在人民間也增進親愛精誠，此為吾人所確信者。新聞界負有與論之實任，為民衆之喉舌，故中日新聞界之緊密提携，又為兩國人民親愛精誠之重要樞捩，民國三十年八月國民政府宣傳部因此有第一屆東亞新聞記者大會之召開。去年滿洲國復有東亞操　者大會之舉行，本年盟邦日本又舉行大東亞新聞大會，參加者除中日滿三國新聞界之外，由大東亞戰爭而獲得解放之東亞新興國家亦有代表參加，此其意義之重大實不言可知。此次大東亞新聞大會，適在中日盟約簽訂大東亞宣言發表之後舉行，其對於完遂戰爭建設東亞尤有其重大之實任。賀言之，此次大會直可謂為大東亞戰爭中第四戰綫之作戰會議。中華民國代表團於此甚願本其奮門之決意，協力戰爭建設東亞之熱誠，盡其最大之努力，以盡東亞新聞界一份子之責任。此次東來，深得　邦使華當局之幫助，道經　洲及朝　，承富局予以莫大之便利，到建東京後，又承股勤招待，吾人衷心至為感謝，並願　此機　，表示甚深謝意</p>
<p>我國代表（申報社長）陳彬酥談·余此次來日，為第三次，沿途所見，日本今已無閑人，亦無一物浪費，人力物力，均已動員，此在中關尚未能作到，實感慚愧·此亦即為吾人應做日本者。</p>

<p>緬甸代表（介　特耶報主筆）烏東堂談：余此次訪日尚屬首次，所最感驚奇者，即日本人民與旅居緬甸之日僑，同樣亦無人種差別之感，余前獲悉大東亞新聞記者大會將召開之消息後，極為欣快，余抵達此間，與日本人接觸後，大東亞建設必完成之確信，益為堅固。現在緬甸處於大東亞戰爭之最前線，故當前有種　困難，然緬甸各界人士，均熟知此戰爭非他人之戰爭，乃為自己本身之戰爭。若間余緬甸人之戰意如何，余　答以此點請君釋念，緬甸人之戰意，決不低於其他大東亞民族之戰意，誠然，吾等緬甸人，已於戰爭中渡過兩年歲月，然吾等為取得勝利，任何苦痛均能忍耐。</p>

<h3 id="c28">玻根維爾之戰的前奏　美國企圖奪回航空基地 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>我們連日在報章上見到日本大本營發表玻根維爾四次空戰的偉大戰果。玻根維爾之戰怎樣發生，本篇很淸楚地告訴我們了。美國用大量的航空兵力，同時幷使用航空母艦，出動攻擊，企圖奪囘所羅門羣島，俾斯麥羣島，新幾內亞羣島等地的航空基地，作為窺伺東印度羣島，切斷日本本十和南洋資源地帶聯絡的根據地。玻根維爾之戰，無疑的對美國這一計劉予以致命的打擊——譯者附識</p>
<p>美國驅使其大量航空兵力，攻擊日本的前綫航空基地，計劃把其茶地推進至玻根維爾島的特洛基那岬。如能成功，則他們將展其所有航空兵力，先奪同包括賴蒲爾在內的俾斯羣　，在這裹設定許多航空基地，配置數倍於此的航空兵力，窺伺日本資源地帶束印度羣島，一方面在這某地航空兵力之外，再加上空母兵力，直叩日本的南洋某地，企圖切斷日本本土與南方共榮圈資源地帶的聯絡。</p>
<p>空母併用作戰</p>
<p>但此次最堪注意者，以前美國僅賴基地航空部隊，在此次的進攻中，則同時使用航空母艦。這種並用航母的戰術，雖因日本海軍機的活躍而受挫，但他們有證決心，企圖完全　滅日本最大的基地賴蒲爾方面的航空兵力，擊滅日本艦隊，以便乘機向特洛基那岼增援，且更想在新不列顛方面登陸，一舉而保持勝利。</p>
<p>前次敵方的空襲南鳥島，大鳥島及對賴蒲爾，蒲印等　的大空　，亦會出動空母。敵方在皮攻作戰上，所以選所羅門羣島，俾斯麥羣島，新幾內亞羣島之線者，在進攻日本本土及資源地帶上祇有此線可以展開大量航空兵力。其餘如阿留申羣島，或散在太平洋中的各小島，均不足以構築大航空基地。且敵人亦沒有餘力建造搭載十餘萬架飛機的航空母艦，那麼他們的進攻路綫，自然祇有限定於所羅門方面。此方面的進攻，不用說是他們的主力。</p>
<p>那麼他們用什麼方法來推進航空基地呢？先在登陸戰之前，常用百架，二百架的大隊飛機轟炸基地，例如此次的莫諾島，特洛基那岬的登陸戰，敵方先用第一次以空母為中心的機動部隊，空襲南鳥島，大鳥島等，並用長距離轟炸機不斷來　吉爾伯諸鳥，在可能範圍內使日本向此方面嚴予戒備，牽制日本航空兵力的他們企圖登陸的玻根維爾島方面集中。</p>
<p>如此，在所羅門，俾斯麥克羣島方面，連日空　日本基地蒲印，拉萊巴，蒲加，賴蒲爾等地，在多的時候達三百數十架。他們的戰術，如用二百餘架的編隊來　時，先由戰鬥機在相當的高度飛來，引開我警戒中的戰門機，於是我戰鬥機與之追逐而演出猛烈的空戰。這時候，便有許多戰門機保護着轟炸機低空來襲，此時我戰鬥機的數目當然比他們少，雖　落來　敵機的幾分之一，但仍有無數轟炸機在我們的飛行基地上拋下了炸彈　去。經過轟炸之很，或正在敵機轟炸之中，整備員，股營隊員等常然連日連夜的趕緊修理，但終趕不上幾百架飛機述日擲彈所造成的損害。且敵人又隨地投下定時炸彈，隨時爆發，故頗感討厭。因此，所羅門基地蒲印，巴拉萊等地，遂被敵所毀，一時不能使用，敵乃率向莫諾島，特洛基那岬，殺然實施登陸戰。</p>
<p>南島島捨命戰</p>
<p>但敵人雖壓我所羅門方面的基地，唯獨賴蒲爾方面未能獲得成功。自十月三十一日至十一月二日晨的登陸戰中，被我從賴蒲爾飛行的海軍機擊斃甚衆。敵人何以不能制壓我賴蒲爾方面呢？這當然是瓜達爾卡納爾，新喬治亞，烏特拉克，倍拉拉倍拉，托洛普利安特等敵航空基地展開的航空兵現在尚未充分基地不能不備有彈藥，汽油及共他多數的貯藏，這些物資，隨時受我海軍機的森炸，補充不能十分充分。所以他們乃敢於使用備有充足的炸彈和汽油，至少可載飛機百架的空母。他們竟然渺視空母不能輕入敵航空基地圖的鐵則，用二艘空母同時來攻，足見他們有決心要奪取我重要的戰略據點，一鼓而下賴蒲爾。</p>
<p>這是不能輕視的拼命的戰術，此次幸賴我作戰首腦部的卓絕的用兵及海軍機之偉大的活躍，而得以防守。敵人還有很多的空母，他們大約將接踵而至地出現。對此，自今起，我將士不能不加以最善的努力。（翼：譯自十一月九日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>半封建性的社會裹，婦女的命運是亳無保障的。加以教靑不普及；在舊習俗與惡勢力下受苦的女子、永遠看不見前途的光明，找不到自己正當的出路。「自古紅顏多薄命」，便成為苦難女性身世的定評。特別是在上海還種未脫封建桎桔而又充滿腐惡勞力的商埠，到處有迷途的羔羊。　目是無告的婦孺、誰知道這裏也有專力於教濟此種不幸婦孺的慈警機關——中國救濟婦孺總會呢。</p>
<p>悠久的歷史</p>
<p>新橋街，靠近甯　路，是中下布民集居的繁築的街道，建立着一座古老的「仁義養黨」，軒昂的大應，舊型戲院式的建築，給人以寬舒的感覺。現在，議裹暫時成為中國救濟婦孺總會的會址。</p>
<p>談紀中國救濟婦孺總會，却已具有三十多年的歷史了，是在民　成立以前吧，那時上　已成為商業驚盛舉洋難處的部會，一方面，由於一商業發總，在附近小鄕鎭的巿民心目中成為淘金之城，男男女女，粉粉湧奔而至，另一方面。由於國際關係及交通便捷作奸犯科者，逐漸以上海為其巢穴。於是，流浪無吿的婦孺固然觸目皆是，而被誘拐販賣以至隨落苦海的，更屬所在都有。造成種種家庭的悲劇、和社會的危機。當時就有一班仁人善士，目擊心傷、希望合力救濟。因由宋漢章，田資民，　芸生，何秋士，許　　。徐乾麟諸氏發起畢辦救濟無吿婦孺的善業，不久獲得朱藻三、王一事，具潤生，謝　聽，項如松，勞敬修，哀履登睹氏贊助，於宣統三年着手總組中國婦孺救濟總會，專事營救迷途及被拐的婦孺。以社會的力量，辦社會的事業。雖未得到政府的濟助、却因一般善十的贊同與支持，事業發展得很快。後來就在江灣火車站附近玉佛寺建立留養院，規換相當宏大，設備也潮臻完善。不意經過二次戰事，該會乃全部被毀。可是戰後平添出無數遭難的婦孺，那時上海各大慈善團體，盡力救濟，猶覺力有未遠，這個原以救濟無吿婦孺為專業的團體怎能不即恢復，在各方面追切的要求之下，「中國婦孺救濟總會一這塊牌子終於又在新橋街仁義善堂出現了。</p>
<p>救濟的對象</p>
<p>中國救濟婦孺總會是純粹以救濟無告婦孺為其工作目標的，救濟的對象是難婦，難童，迷路婦孺，慘被拐賣者，以及流浪街頭無家可歸的女人和孩子。救濟工作，據該會負責人說，原來規定有六大項目，即是：</p>
<p>一，營救：該會從前屬有幾個誠實可靠的偵探，在　埠車站及共他公共塲所，與　憲方面取得聯絡，專事營救被誘拐販賣的婦女及孩子。這種富於俠義精神的工作，現在因為地方環境轉愛，改為調查事務，不再自行從事營救了。而且，實際上要維持業已獲救的婦孺，已經不是一件容易的事，要收容各善團送來的被救婦孺，也感到力有未逮呢。</p>
<p>二，招領：該會收容一了迷途及被拐的婦孺之後，經過一定的調查及登記手續，其有明確住處者，妥為送回之外，大多數立即登報招領。其家屬祇須覓其妥保，即可不付任何費用，當塲領回。對於因不堪膚待而逃出的不幸者，則在其家長領回時嚴厲勸告，不得再加膚待，以維持人道與正義。這種為維護被壓迫者的工作，如果認眞仗義進行，眞是功德無量。</p>
<p>三，資遣，據該會負責人說，對於迷途及被拐之婦孺，如果能夠說出詳細地址的，那怕遠在他鄉，該會就會派遣幹員，護送回籍，不收任何費用。現在因為限於經費，加以交通不便，除了上海附近以外，已經無力資遣了。以上幾項工作，都是消極性質的，現在集中全力在支持的，則為以下積極性的教養工作：</p>
<p>四，留養：該會對於被拐之婦孺，如無家屬認領，或不能資遣回籍者，就得像自己骨肉一般，務使幼右所教，壯有所歸，老有所養。從前在玉佛寺內設右幼稚園，男留飬院，女留飬院，恤老院等，現在大部份事業都已　承下來，幼，男二院設在仁義善堂，女留養院則設在北成都路。</p>
<p>五，習藝：該會對於收贊的婦孺，從前規定至相當年齡，就由會介紹至約定的工廠或商號　藝，使人人均有一技一藝之長，以自力解決生活問題，並進而為社會良好之公民。現在更進而在會內加以必要的學術教育，使出會後即可自立謀生，</p>
<p>六，乞養及擇配。。該會規定，凡有正當職業與地位的市民，缺乏嗣續或配偶者，均可向該會申請選掃適當的對象（子女或妻室）。不過必須遵照該會所定乞養及擇配章程，覓具妥實保證人，愼重辦理，以維護其心血教養的婦孺的未來幸福。</p>
<p>三十多年來，中國救濟婦孺總會已經救養了一萬數千名無告的婦孺，除了陸續遣送　給領，乞飬，報配，以及介紹在工商界謀生者以外，目前留飬中的婦孺總數，還達五百餘名之多，且有增無减之勢呢。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3 id="c50">比較印度戰時經濟 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>以著名經濟學家烏阿曼，先　敎授為中心的印度經濟學者二十名，曾以一九四三—四四年度的印度預算為主題的印度戰時經濟政策，發表共同聲明，共中關於印度現在的事實，所叙述的是。。　印度所發生的食糧恐慌，完全由於印政府大量掠奪盒糧，其實任應由印政府負担，　棉製品與　製品，因印政府有收買特權，且强制輸出統制、遂使人民衣若發生問題，　印度的製紙業，大部陷於停止生產狀態，因此，印度紙的恐慌，已成為嚴重問題。</p>
<p>綜觀以上所述戰時印度的經濟實况，可見印度民衆是在物資缺乏與通貨膨脹的夾攻下，度着其茍延殘喘的生活，其處境的齦難，自然猶遠在我們之上。我們的食糧問題，誠然未能得到澈底的解決，可是，政府當局對於米糧統制問題，最近已試盡其最大的努力，袛是如何積極疏通米糧來源，如何積極增進米糧塵量，乃為今日我國解決民實的惟一課題。其次以言人民的衣着，自然不能以上海一個都市為全國人民衣着問題之投表，因為我國最大多數人民所需要的衣着，不是絲綢，呢　，嗶嘰之類，而是棉與綿布；自從綿紗布收買而後，配給實施辦法，已成為舉國人民所引領以待的一稱福音，因此，人民衣着有無問題，還要看實施綿紗布配給的成續如何。又其次，對文化有莫大關係之紙的問題，近傳華中區內各造紙廠，正積極進行增產，成績尚稱滿意，而上海地區各造紙廠，亦正加緊努力，務使華中區內在製紙方面，得以自足自給；但為保障今後紙張之供應，實當由舉國上下，一致節省不必要之消耗，因此，紙業統制，實有強化之必要。</p>

<h3 id="c59">駐印度的英美空軍真相 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 大澤寬三</p>
<p>在緬旬進八雨季之前的去年十月至本年六月，日陸軍機曾擊　無數敵戰關機，並連袂遠征，猛煤金斯基，加爾各答，昆明等地，與敵空軍以重大的打擊。敵空軍技術雖拙劣，但欲用量的優勢來補救，拼命補充被擊學擊毀的數目。緬旬進入正式的雨季之筱，敵戰觀機曾不顧氣候的惡劣，行使游擊戰，敵轟炸機隊也執拗地出擊，以鐵道，橋橙，船舶等為主，盲炸我運輸路綫。</p>
<p>這肓炸的次數，六月計一八二次（八五六架），七月約增一倍，計三一二次，出動機數亦增至一一五八架。</p>
<p>由此可知敵方正在積　補充航空兵力，其第一綫機在五月約六五〇架（內美機一五〇架），六月增至約一〇〇〇架（內美機三五〇架），七月約一三〇〇架（內美機四五〇架），綜計每月約增加三〇〇架左右。本年八月的情形，獲悉較詳，茲略記如次：</p>
<p>東部印度方面　第一綫機約五〇〇架。</p>
<p>英空軍（戰　機　一三〇架，轟炸機一　〇〇架其他二〇與。</p>
<p>美空軍（戰　機　八〇架，轟炸糧一〇　〇架，其他一〇〇架　）。</p>
<p>錫關島方面第　一綫機約一二〇〇架</p>
<p>英空軍（八二〇　架，包括印度人部隊　約一〇〇架）</p>
<p>美空軍（四〇〇　架以上）</p>
<p>由此可知，在印度的　航空兵力，業日將近二〇〇〇架，其勞殊　輕侮。</p>
<p>此後復因北非兵力的抽調，因義大利退出軸心復英美空軍經地中海輔充路綫的縮短等關係，敵方的補充則見活漢，而對緬旬的育炸亦愈趨熾烈。而在雨季中日本陸軍航空部隊的沉默，至此亦突韓活躍。</p>
<p>脆弱的敵戰機</p>
<p>緬旬空戰之初，英空軍為主力，去年兩季開過去以後所出現的是寇的斯PI工三六，寇的斯P—四〇K型，暴風式二B，戰　機的各種待點大多類似美製飛機。</p>
<p>寇的斯P—三六型，比勃發洛及P—四〇等型為強，但終非日機的對手。</p>
<p>把寇的斯P—四〇改造成功的K型，其性能尚未十分明瞭，翼內裝右二〇公分機關砲四挺，頗稱輕快，和暴風式二B型同稱優秀機種，但和日本戰罰機比來，仍不足數。</p>
<p>敵方戰　機駕駛員的技術極為低劣，尤以英國的戰鬥機員最不足道。前次杜哈榮里空戰中，我戰鬥機隊八架突八敵戰鬥機十六架編隊中，擊落其八架，其餘逃走，但在這次戰鬥中，此方面戰鬥機中敵彈者一架也沒有。且遭過時的態勞，敵方非常有利。從這轉變不利態勢而獲太戰果看來，可知彼此技術上有很大的差別。　　空軍對其戰鬥機隊，指示。。「發見日本機在自己的上面時，即作降總傘落下的準備？又日機　　在後的塲合，旋回過去即等於死。如欲旅同，須先用全力脫離，然而再旋囘。其次，攻擊日機的塲合，從後上方加以一擊之後，立即離開」！</p>
<p>又對　風式戰鬥機請示。。「決不可與敵單型戰鬥機交綏，僅可專對敵轟炸機出以攻勢」。這不作自己告訴人家不敢〇日本戰鬥機交戰</p>
<p>結果，英美方面的敵方戰鬥機陣容，英美方面的船員及其件能都不成問題。英戰鬥機隊祇能在近距敵地上作戰上始能協力，美國戰鬥機隊專擔任加爾各答周圍各飛機塲要地的防空任務，所以敵方的戰鬥機隊終究不能飛積極的航空決戰之主要任務。</p>
<p>此外的戰鬥機有美。國的P—四三，—P六六和英國的蒲發德雙引擊戰鬥機，但前二糧為數極少，蒲發德型最初擔任加爾各答的防空，此後大概每二機編成一隊，利用其裝甲在前綫專門掃射地面，但這也不成問題。總之，敵戰鬥機隊正在後方積極　復戰力中。</p>
<p>敵轟炸機狀態</p>
<p>反之，敵轟炸機隊的陣管，大可警戒。</p>
<p>去年末以來，美國積極增加駐印航空兵力，緬旬方面最初出現的英國蒲倫希姆，現在均代以康泰立台特B二四，北美B二五，波音B一七等大型熏轟炸機•前面所述出動盲炸的大部分幾均為美國空軍。</p>
<p>大約兩季過去以後，因恃有龐大的生產力為背景，平均每日同時出動一〇〇架以上編成大隊盲炸遠距離的目B,交通，生產補充關係的要衝。</p>
<p>紙旬方面的敵轟炸機，最多的是統一標二四型，這是常出現於緬甸全境上空而為我們所最熱悉的轟炸機。大體其高度在五千至六千米，八架或九架編成一隊，作成三機一隊山字形編隊的單縱陣前來襲擊。有時亦以三機一隊分別從各種高度與方向</p>
<p>波音B十七型機出現於太平洋的為數頗多，很在緬旬方面，本年六月四臼，出現於仰光上空，並擊擊其二架之後，即告絕跡。</p>
<p>至於B—二四型，及東京已很熟悉的北美B二五五型，在緬旬上部中部更時常出現。記者在中部緬何曾常見到這編隊。</p>
<p>此外的轟炸機計如英國的維卡斯·威靈頓型，因是舊式機，祗在夜間有時出現於中緬甸，無足輕重。美國的道格拉斯A二〇型，是否在印度方面，還未明暸，大約印度還沒有這種飛機。B二六型也尚未發現。</p>
<p>聽說英國的新銳機台哈比蘭特，莫斯基特已有發現。我們祇接到無綫電說：「莫斯基特型新轟炸機已出現，注意！」，但尚表在戰錢上，見。爾季過去以很，或許以每一中隊的數目前來轟炸。舊式的警倫希姆型，增加發動機的馬力後改為「比斯萊」型，不過無論如何總是很陳舊的機種了。英國的勃拉克本。史居阿俯街轟炸機，會有一中隊在阿恰布方面出動，大的題試騐的性質。</p>
<p>實際是美空軍</p>
<p>如此實來，印度方面敵空軍勞力的實體，美國空軍現已替代了開戰之初的英國空軍，且共中心是美國的轟炸機隊，機種方面有B二四，B二五二種。伹因戰鬥機的情形，如上所述，不足以和轟炸機隊編成聯合隊形，故袛能賴其重裝甲進擊。</p>
<p>這些轟炸機隊，分佈於加爾各答周園六〇哩半徑內所建造的九〇個以上的飛機塲」，強化對空監視，防空火器頗稱完備，，並備有短波警戒器。這九〇個以上的飛機塲，每一飛機，所以實是一個一個的飛義塲羣。這飛機塲羣中的某一飛機塲受到轟炸時，立刻就從另一飛機塲飛出戰門機邀擊。試舉一例：美國第七轟炸飛行團所使用的飛機塲，計有齊阿蒲阿，特哈薩利，亞伽爾泰拉，其利爾等地（〇號者有夜間照明設備。）英國所使用的基地有奇泰貫，芬尼，亞果拉，雪爾奇阿等地。（待續）（翔：譯自十一月七日朝日週刊）</p>

<p>— 王祥之</p>
<p>讀本月五日國民論壇陳伯民君之「戰時房屋租賃法第七條的商榷」一文，不禁有感於國人傳統的對於法律觀念之薄弱，不論是非之矛盾，但隨吾心之愛惡，利我者是之，利他者非之，紛紛擾攘，是非無定，中國今日所患在上下不重注洽，偏欲想望道之以德，齊之以禮的高不可　的理想，來治三代以下今日的人民，結果則欲求制法者之守法而不可得。</p>
<p>就事論事，關於房屋租貨民法四五〇條第二項第三項並未廢止，而事變以來，法院從未探用之，承租人雖受益不淺，二房東更獲利不少。然在法治方面言，究竟得失如何，未聞有愛其禮而不愛其羊者，出而一論之，此豈好現象乎，此番戰時房屋租貨法之頒布，未嘗非政府有鑒於與其蹈達法之嫌，毋寗明令修改，以重法治精神，觀其內容一方保障居住之安甯，一方予業主以相當利益，立法者雙方兼顧，實得事理之平，不容輕議也。</p>
<p>郎以該法而言，二房東可得百分之五十之純利，言者置之不論，而默許一之，獨對業主，雖承認其房租低落損失過鉅，猶只許酌量加租，以補很失，不許有利益，此平心之論乎！</p>
<p>提到安定民生日用品配給之時，吾但見當局之規定限價，無論對於生產者販賣者均許右一定之利益，表見有論其非者，獨於房產之所右者，只許有損失不許右利益，此是何種論理，總之論事須平正忠恕，否則終不免一偏之論也。</p>
<h3 id="c61">戶口米改斤兩計算 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 黃志超</p>
<p>一敝店為第三區（閘北）一戶口米商，十月份得配給戶口米二期三十四包，戶口麵紛一百五十包，利潤規定米每包十八元，一麵粉每包十元二角，共得一利潤二千一百四十二元。除去米粉車資（每包二元）共三百六十八元，會費每月一百五十元，主管機關調查員視察費（米一期五十元，粉一期十元）共一百二十元，退囘空麻袋東資十五元，貼米證麵粉證紙張費五十元，十月份净得利潤僅一千四百三十九元，戶口米粉脫期時每月尚不滿此數。試問這一千四百餘元怎能維持一店之水電房租伙食與薪水？况且戶口米商又不能兼營黑市米。</p>
<p>戶口米數月內從每石二百五十二元，增加到現在每石八百元。成本加起三倍餘，戶口麵粉增價後利潤從每包二元八角增到卞元二角，但戶口米利潤數月來仍為每包十八元，照理成本增加，利潤亦應增加，同為配給物，米與麵粉之利潤百分比不同，實令人不解。此宜請主管機關顧到米商之痛苦，重新調整米商之合法利潤，務使能維持一店最低限度之開支。</p>
<p>戶口米應改為斤兩計算，因為戶口麵粉用斤兩計算，尚無不便之處。日本在滬僑民之戶口米亦以斤兩計算，戶口米改為斤兩計算後，可免去不良米商此舞弊，米商亦可卸去尅扣升斗之嫌疑。現時甩升斗糧米，西貢米碎米一斗須十六斤四兩，紅米糙米一斗僅十五斤餘。彼此相差太鉅，所以戶口米用斤兩計算，有利而無弊。（却酬）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Expectations for the Cotton Control Association <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The position of Director-General of the Cotton Control Association has been officially announced by the National Government, with Mr. Wen Lanting appointed. Furthermore, the Chinese and Japanese committee members have also been internally decided. It is anticipated that the association will be established and begin purchasing and allocating cotton in the near future. The cotton harvest has been underway for some time, but as it is a controlled commodity, trading has been completely halted until the control organization is formed and purchase prices are determined. Farmers are holding cotton but unable to exchange it for cash to cover expenses, so their economic hardship is self-evident. Similarly, manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials and are depleting their capital, so their situation is just as dire as that of the farmers. Therefore, both farmers and manufacturers urgently await the early establishment of the control organization and the rapid implementation of purchasing and allocation.</p>
<p>There are three aspects to controlling commodities: controlling production, controlling purchasing, and controlling distribution. The latter two are symptomatic, passive measures. Only the first—controlling production—is a fundamental, active measure. Since the establishment of the National General Chamber of Commerce, only symptomatic measures have been taken, which is due to legal regulations. However, if fundamental measures are not advanced simultaneously, purchasing and allocation will inevitably reach a point of exhaustion. Therefore, we hope that the soon-to-be-established Cotton Control Association will, before its scope of work is determined, suggest to the government that controlling production be included within its scope, so that production, purchasing, and allocation can be seamlessly integrated. Relatedly, we believe that the Grain Control Association's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee should also be given this mission.</p>
<p>Since the opening of trade, the volume of imported cotton products has increased year after year. In the past decade, there has also been a large influx of raw cotton, which demonstrates the inadequacy of our nation's cotton production. The most important mission of the Cotton Control Association should be to actively research improved cotton varieties, expand the area of cotton fields, and find ways to guide farmers to adopt scientific planting and fertilization methods, increasing cotton yields to gradually close this gap. The textile industry should also be actively encouraged to adopt scientific management and improve technology, so that costs can be reduced and product quality improved. Only then can we compete with foreign goods and completely change the national mindset of valuing imported products.</p>
<p>The current work of the Cotton Control Association undoubtedly lies in purchasing and allocation. Regarding this aspect, we would also like to contribute some suggestions:</p>
<p>Purchase prices must take into account farmers' production costs, plus a reasonable profit; otherwise, it will affect the enthusiasm for selling this year's crop, and even more so next year's production.</p>
<p>The purchasing process must not utilize political power. For example, the rumored method of the Grain Control Association to use the Baojia system for promotion must be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p>Purchasing organizations should be established and completed in advance, and the funds for purchase prices should be planned and sufficient. Once the price is announced, purchasing must begin immediately to avoid farmers becoming impatient and being exploited by intermediaries.</p>
<p>Strictly supervise all purchasing agencies to ensure that quality is not arbitrarily lowered and quantities are not arbitrarily deducted. In particular, the receiving procedures should be simple and quick, and absolutely no delays should be allowed, to avoid increasing losses for farmers and giving operators opportunities for manipulation.</p>
<p>The above are the points to be noted regarding purchasing. Regarding allocation, it is said that this purchasing work will be carried out by textile trade organizations separately, and then the Cotton Control Association will approve their retention of a portion, with the remainder being allocated in a unified manner. If this is the case, in order to maintain their operating rates, it is feared that factories will inevitably underreport their acquisitions. To prevent this phenomenon from occurring, the Cotton Control Association must exercise particularly strict supervision during purchasing. The production volume of each factory must also be investigated at any time. The Cotton Control Association is the last of the subordinate organizations of the National General Chamber of Commerce to be established and has many good and bad experiences to draw upon. We hope that the Cotton Control Association can learn from the strengths and avoid the weaknesses to improve its organization and complete this important mission.</p>

<h3 id="e3">At an Osaka Roundtable Discussion, Japanese Foreign Minister Delivers a Speech Elucidating the Reasons for the Inevitable Victory in the Greater East Asia War <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency): According to Osaka telephone reports, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, at 3:00 PM on the 15th at the New Osaka Hotel, attended a roundtable discussion hosted by the Osaka Prefecture Chamber of Commerce and Industry and delivered a speech to approximately one hundred representatives of the Kansai economic community, elucidating the reasons for the inevitable victory in the Greater East Asia War as follows: The Greater East Asia War is a war of Asians defending their homeland. After the Greater East Asia Conference, the belief that "without Asia, there is no Japan, and without Japan, there is no Asia" has now spread throughout Asia. The Greater East Asia Declaration is fundamentally different in nature from the enemy's various declarations. The Greater East Asia War is a war that advocates world justice. The audience was deeply moved. The main points of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's speech were as follows:</p>
<p>·Reviving East Asia·</p>
<p>Much of Asia's fertile land is controlled by Britain and the United States. The diligent people of Asia have suffered under the tyrannical rule of Britain and the United States in the past. However, with the progress of the Greater East Asia War, the Asian people have all awakened and are willing to revive East Asia with fervent determination. They have now risen up to liberate East Asia, defend East Asia, and unite the strength of Asia to destroy the enemy. Asia has now returned to being East Asia, no longer a colony of Britain and the United States. However, Britain and the United States remain obstinate, attempting to reconquer Asia and permanently turn Asia into their colony for exploitation and plunder. In order to return Asia to the Asians, Japan has dispatched expeditionary forces to distant lands. Asia is the homeland of all Asians, and all Asians should defend their homeland to the death. If Asia loses this war, we will lose our homeland. Therefore, this war should be called the Asian War of Independence. We still remember that the United States struggled for more than seven years to gain independence and break free from its shackles, winning glorious independence. Therefore, the United States' invasion of Asia is actually denying its own historical life. Ultimate victory is always inseparable from justice. If we examine history and trace the causes of prosperity, it is an unchanging iron rule. Ultimate victory is ours, and the reason for this lies in this principle.</p>
<p>·Building a Foundation·</p>
<p>Speaking of the foundation for building Asia, it is to stabilize Asia. Therefore, we should first defend East Asia and establish the stability of East Asia. Second, the construction work should be carried out based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has been announced to the world, and the five major guidelines for East Asia's construction can be called the Greater East Asia Charter. Therefore, all the people of East Asia support it. Representatives from various East Asian countries attended the Greater East Asia Conference with great sincerity. Therefore, the joint declaration was passed unanimously at the conference. The Greater East Asia Conference was a grand occasion rarely seen in history. Representatives from various countries fully expressed their sincerity. All speeches came from the bottom of their hearts. The Greater East Asia Conference can be said to be the voice of Asia. Asia is united in heart and mind. Without Japan, there is no Asia, and without Asia, there is no Japan. This has become a strong belief throughout Asia. The reason why we will surely achieve victory lies in this. The fifth item in the Greater East Asia Construction Guidelines states that we should increase friendship with all nations, eliminate racial discrimination, communicate culture, and further open up resources in order to contribute to the development of the world. This has shown our aspirations to the world and demonstrated our plans for world peace.</p>
<p>·Opening Resources·</p>
<p>What we expect is to open up the world's human and material resources, promote communication in culture and religion, and realize the ideal of harmony among all nations. The great way has no gate, so there is no way to open it. As the saying goes, "If there is no East Asia, how can there be South Seas?" This is the idea of openness that we adhere to. The enemy has repeatedly made propaganda-like opinions on post-war management. Most of them are just tricks, and this can be seen from the contradiction of their past words and deeds. What the representatives who participated in the Greater East Asia Conference welcomed the most was that the fifth item in the declaration had already been explained. From this point of view, we know that the vision of East Asia's leaders is not limited to East Asia, but extends to the entire world. Today, our enthusiasm for completing the common war has become increasingly high, and the reason for the ultimate victory lies in this. The reason why the representatives of various countries had common feelings and resonance was that the joint declaration was based on the ideals of justice. The representatives of various countries were able to touch the true face of Japan and understand Japan.</p>
<p>·Completing the Mission·</p>
<p>During the conference, representatives from various countries confided their inner thoughts to me. To make justice shine, this is the essence of our national structure. To revive East Asia and create a smooth path for East Asia, if we can carry on with indomitable faith and work together with the comrades of East Asia, advancing bravely, then even if the enemy Britain and the United States are strong, they will surely succumb to the truth, and the final victory will belong to us. The ten billion people of East Asia, who share joys and sorrows and whose destinies are closely related, are now standing on their own positions, bravely struggling to fulfill the belief of living and dying together, and to shoulder the noble task of East Asia's construction with blood and sweat to complete this mission of peace. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is built with the fresh blood of the ten billion people of Greater East Asia. At the time of this conference, the Japanese army achieved new and great victories in the South Pacific, and therefore the spirit of the ten billion people of East Asia was even more激昂. It is believed that the construction of Greater East Asia will surely progress with the great victories of the Japanese army.</p>

<p>Andaman, 15th (Central News Agency): Japanese Prime Minister Tojo previously stated at the Greater East Asia Conference that the Andaman and Nicobar Islands would be transferred to the Provisional Government of Free India. The residents of Andaman are extremely grateful for this. The 18,000 Indians, who make up the majority of the local residents, are particularly grateful. The initial reaction was that these Indians donated to the national defense fund on the 12th. Furthermore, the Andaman branch of the Indian Independence League held a meeting at the Civil Administration Department on the 11th and decided to organize a volunteer army under the branch director. Committees have been selected to be responsible for selecting strong young men between the ages of 20 and 40 from various villages on the island. The inauguration ceremony is scheduled to be held on the 25th.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japanese Information Officer Inoue Meets with Foreign Correspondents, Vigorously Denouncing False Propaganda by the U.S. Authorities <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency): Japanese Information Bureau Information Officer Sadao Inoue met with a group of foreign correspondents on the 15th and vehemently denounced the false propaganda by the U.S. authorities, stating: After the U.S. authorities suffered a disastrous defeat in the waters off Bougainville Island, they continued to engage in false propaganda in an attempt to deceive the world. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox even claimed on the 12th and 13th that "Japan's statements are all fabricated propaganda" and even stated that no American ships in the Pacific had sunk since October 6th. Such words are all acts of self-deception and only arouse deeper suspicion and distrust of American pronouncements among the domestic public and the people of the world. In particular, the fact that the U.S. government still maintains a calm attitude despite suffering millions of casualties and losses on the seas off the islands of Bougainville in the South Pacific can be described as completely devoid of conscience. The biggest reason why the enemy resorts to this kind of deceptive propaganda is that the U.S. government is deeply afraid of the public's morale weakening. Moreover, the American people are now increasingly doubtful about the purpose of sending their children to the front lines of the South Pacific, so they are creating a war atmosphere. Second, the U.S. government is alarmed by Japan's active promotion of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, even during the war. In particular, since the announcement of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the Greater East Asian nations have reached a consensus on the goals of the war, and the unity of the Greater East Asian nations has become an unbreakable fact, which makes the United States deeply anxious. Therefore, the U.S. government is increasingly secretive about its failures in order to avoid arousing anti-war sentiment among the people.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency): The first National Health Administration Conference, convened by the Department of Health, grandly opened at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association yesterday (the 15th) morning at 10:00 AM. Representatives from various regions gathered at the Central Hotel at 7:30 AM, led by the Conference Chairman Lu Runzhi.

All personnel stood respectfully at the entrance to welcome him. The Chairman entered the venue to the strains of military music, and the opening ceremony commenced. Present were officials from various agencies, including Chen Bijun, member of the Central Committee; Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Zhou Longxiang, Secretary-General; Li Yi, Director-General; Xi Zewen, Vice Minister, and dozens of guests.

(Another report) The Health Conference has opened yesterday (the 15th), and the group review meeting will continue at 9:00 AM today (the 16th) at Nanjing.</p>
<p>Main Points of Chairman Wang's Instructions</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency): At the first National Health Administration Conference on November 15th, Chairman Wang personally gave instructions, encouraging medical professionals nationwide to focus on health administration and relieve the suffering of the majority of the people. While it is understood that engaging in health administration is less profitable than private practice, the allies currently have medical experts enlisting in the military, prioritizing the needs of the nation over personal gain. Our country has few medical professionals, and most are concentrated in cities, so the majority of the people cannot benefit from modern medicine, and their diseases and suffering cannot be alleviated. Modern medicine has become the exclusive domain of the wealthy. This is deeply distressing. The purpose of health administration is to concentrate medical professionals, establish a rational organization based on patriotism, and alleviate the diseases and suffering of the majority of the people. In short, the great problem facing the country is not only the lack of medical professionals, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical materials, but especially the failure to rationalize the organization of health administration, with more doctors engaged in private practice and fewer serving general health. His words were extremely solemn.</p>
<p>Chairman's Opening Remarks</p>
<p>He stated briefly, "Today is the first National Health Administration Conference. We are honored to have the Chairman of the National Government personally give instructions, the ministers of various Yuan and Departments provide guidance, and medical experts and administrative leaders from various regions travel from afar. It can be said to be an unprecedented grand event in the health administration field since the return to the capital. Our department was established under the wartime system, especially during the promotion of the New National Movement. We look up to the central government's commitment to health administration, which is about to enter the stage of practice and has become an important task in the national mobilization. We who serve in this difficult time of creation must take on the responsibility of construction. The first task is to improve administrative institutions, and the second is to secure special health funds. These two tasks are the prerequisites for our duties. Therefore, we must gather all the talents together to discuss and find more accurate answers. From these two issues, we can extend to all other issues, naturally discern and reveal, and express our opinions. In recent days, I have browsed proposals from various parties and feel that the colleagues at this conference have already reached a consensus on the goals of health administration. After this sincere discussion, we will surely have fruitful results. We will talk today and act tomorrow. With great excitement, let us move forward on the path of health construction."</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency): Japanese forces launched a sweeping campaign along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line. On the first day of action, they occupied Zhangmutou, a stronghold of the Chongqing Sixth Advance Column. On the night of the 11th, they encircled the remnants of the Chongqing forces south of Laifangdao Lake on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, forming an encirclement. On the 13th, they launched a concerted attack, and the Chongqing forces are currently trapped within the Japanese encirclement. Furthermore, the Japanese air force, in coordination with ground forces, heavily bombed Hettang Pai and Dashi Ling, key points of the Chongqing forces in that area, on the 13th, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 15th (Central News Agency): Japanese forces in South China and the Hong Kong Defense Forces are currently launching a new sweeping campaign in the area along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. This operation has particularly profound economic implications, as the only links between Hong Kong and Guangzhou are air and sea transport. Once the area along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is cleared, land transport will be possible. If this is realized, Guangzhou's economy will be further improved. The flow of goods, such as rice, hemp, and sugar, between Hong Kong and Guangzhou will be smoother, and Hong Kong's food problem can also be solved easily.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Greater East Asia Press Conference is about to be held here. Delegates from various countries within the Co-Prosperity Sphere have arrived one after another. Reporters recently interviewed the delegates separately to ask about their aspirations for the conference and their impressions of visiting Japan. The delegates provided statements, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Liqiu, Head of the Delegation from our Country, stated: I am deeply excited to have been sent by the National Government to attend the Greater East Asia Press Conference. After arriving in Tokyo, I witnessed the progress of construction by our allies and the solemnity of wartime life. The peaceful cooperation between China and Japan, and even the peaceful cooperation in East Asia, not only strengthens diplomatic relations between governments but also enhances affection and sincerity among the people. This is what we firmly believe. The press bears the responsibility of public opinion and is the mouthpiece of the people. Therefore, the close cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese press is a crucial pivot for the affection and sincerity between the two peoples. For this reason, the Propaganda Department of the National Government convened the first East Asia Press Conference in August of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). Last year, the State of Manchuria held the East Asia Journalists Conference. This year, our ally Japan is holding the Greater East Asia Press Conference. In addition to the press from China, Japan, and Manchuria, representatives from the newly emerging East Asian countries that have been liberated by the Greater East Asia War are also participating. The significance of this is self-evident. This Greater East Asia Press Conference is taking place after the signing of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration. It has an even greater practical responsibility for completing the war and building East Asia. To put it felicitously, this conference can be described as a combat meeting on the fourth front in the Greater East Asia War. The delegation from the Republic of China is very willing to dedicate its determination to contribute to the war and its enthusiasm for building East Asia, to the best of its ability, to fulfill its responsibility as a member of the East Asian press. During this trip, we received great help from the Japanese authorities in our country. Passing through Manchuria and Korea, we received great convenience from the local authorities. After arriving in Tokyo, we were also treated with great care. We are sincerely grateful and would like to take this opportunity to express our deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>Chen Bingshu (President of Shen Bao), a delegate from our country, said: This is my third time coming to Japan. What I have seen along the way is that there are no idle people in Japan now, and nothing is wasted. Both human and material resources have been mobilized. This has not yet been achieved in China, which is truly regrettable. This is also what we should learn from Japan.</p>
<p>Sema Nir (Full Pen of the Thai Mai Daily), a delegate from Thailand: After I return to my country, I will introduce what I have seen in Japan to my countrymen and talk about the recent situation in Thailand. The Thai people especially want our motherland to be an independent country forever.</p>
<p>Bao Qister (Editor-in-Chief of the Philippine Forum), a delegate from the Philippines, said: Since Manila was captured by the Japanese army, the newspapers and magazines in the Philippines have gradually developed. Now, the Manila Press has published seven daily newspapers, five weekly magazines, and two monthly magazines. In the future, these newspapers and magazines will inevitably unite with each other to do their best to develop the discourse of Greater East Asia together with the Japanese press organizations. The national language of the Philippines is now stipulated as Tagalog! Our policy is to make the residents understand the reality of Greater East Asia construction as much as possible so that they can unite the national will under the banner of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. I hope that this conference will exchange views on common issues.</p>
<p>U Dongtang (Editor-in-Chief of the Kyet Thaye Daily), a delegate from Burma, said: This is my first visit to Japan, and what I am most surprised by is that the Japanese people and the Japanese living in Burma have no sense of racial discrimination. After I learned that the Greater East Asia Press Conference would be held, I was extremely happy. After I arrived here and came into contact with the Japanese people, my conviction that the construction of Greater East Asia will be completed has become even stronger. Burma is now at the forefront of the Greater East Asia War, so there are some difficulties at present. However, people from all walks of life in Burma are well aware that this war is not someone else's war but their own war. If you ask me how the Burmese people feel about the war, I can answer that you can rest assured on this point. The Burmese people's morale for the war is by no means lower than that of other Greater East Asian nations. Indeed, we Burmese have spent two years in the war, but we can endure any suffering to achieve victory.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: South of Kyiv, German forces, regardless of Soviet resistance and numerical superiority, were still able to recapture several key points. Street fighting is still in progress in the Zhitomir urban area. The Soviet army has failed to force the German army to retreat westward. Northwest of the city, German artillery heavily shelled the Soviet tank formations, stopping their advance. In Crimea, the Soviet army is still trying to expand the bridgehead on the Kerch Peninsula, but has failed. Heavy fighting is still in progress in the Perekop Isthmus to compete for the access to the peninsula. The Soviet offensive against the German bridgehead in Kherson has also been repelled.

<p>Buenos Aires, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from Cairo: Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas told a group of reporters on the afternoon of the 13th that the Egyptian government would not tolerate the oppression of its compatriots in Lebanon. The Egyptian government will not cease negotiations until the Lebanese President, Prime Minister, and other cabinet members are released. The Egyptian government, in the name of the citizens of all Arab countries, demands that the legitimate Lebanese government resume governing the country.</p>
<p>Ankara, 15th (Central News Agency) - Anatolian News Agency reports: The Iraqi parliament held a special session yesterday and unanimously passed a resolution protesting the attitude of the French Committee towards Lebanon and its leaders. The resolution was sent to the parliaments of the United States and the United Kingdom, demanding the removal of French influence in Lebanon until the end of the war, with the dispute to be resolved by a peace conference. Prime Minister Sayid informed the parliamentarians of the regrettable events in Lebanon during the session and explained the Iraqi government's response. He declared: The Regent of Iraq has expressed Iraq's dissatisfaction to the British Ambassador and the American Counselor in Iraq and has sent a letter through the Iraqi Counselor in Beirut to the families of the Lebanese President and his cabinet members, stating that Iraq will make its greatest efforts for Lebanon and is willing to provide personal assistance at any time.</p>

<p>Istanbul, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Turkish government held an important cabinet meeting on the 13th, following a parliamentary session on the 12th, where important agreements were reached.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to the Reuter News Agency: London Chronicle's correspondent in Ankara, Mr. Zordan, believes that Turkey will not enter the war within a few months and that England is of greater value to Turkey. The standard for determining the benefits granted to Turkey by the anti-Axis powers after the war depends on the timing of Turkey's entry into the war. In other words, the extent of Turkey's benefits will depend on how early or late it joins the war. It is heard that the Turkish Foreign Minister said that what Turkey wants cannot be provided by the anti-Axis powers, which indicates that Turkey does not plan to enter the war in the short term.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Prelude to the Battle of Bougainville: America Attempts to Recapture Air Bases <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>We have seen the Imperial Japanese Headquarters announce the great results of the four air battles over Bougainville in the newspapers for several days. This article clearly tells us how the Battle of Bougainville came about. The United States used a large amount of air power, and also used aircraft carriers to launch attacks, attempting to recapture the air bases in the Solomon Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the New Guinea Archipelago, as bases for spying on the Dutch East Indies and cutting off the connection between Japan and the resource areas in the South Seas. The Battle of Bougainville undoubtedly dealt a fatal blow to this American plan - Translator's Note</p>
<p>The United States used its large air power to attack the Japanese front-line air bases, planning to advance its turf to Cape Torokina on Bougainville Island. If successful, they would deploy all their air power to first seize the Bismarck Archipelago, including Rabaul. Here, they would set up many air bases, deploy several times more air power than that, spy on the Dutch East Indies in the Japanese resource zone, and on the one hand, add carrier air power to the air power in that area, directly attacking Japan's certain areas in the South Seas, attempting to cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the resource zones of the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Combined Carrier Operations</p>
<p>But what is most noteworthy this time is that the United States previously relied only on base air units, but in this offensive, they used aircraft carriers at the same time. Although this tactic of using aircraft carriers in combination was thwarted by the activity of Japanese naval aircraft, they are determined to completely annihilate the air power in the Rabaul area, the largest Japanese base, and destroy the Japanese fleet in order to take the opportunity to reinforce Cape Torokina, and even want to land in New Britain, to maintain victory in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>In the previous enemy air raids on Minamitori Island, Okinotori Island, and the major air attacks on Rabaul, Palau, etc., aircraft carriers were also dispatched. The reason why the enemy chose the line of the Solomon Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the New Guinea Archipelago in the offensive operation is that this line is the only one where a large amount of air power can be deployed to attack the Japanese mainland and resource zones. The remaining islands, such as the Aleutian Islands, or the small islands scattered in the Pacific, are not sufficient to build large air bases. Moreover, the enemy does not have the extra capacity to build aircraft carriers carrying more than 100,000 aircraft, so their offensive route is naturally limited to the Solomon area. The offensive in this area is, needless to say, their main force.</p>
<p>So what methods do they use to advance their air bases? Before the landing operation, they often used large groups of hundreds or two hundred aircraft to bomb the base. For example, in this landing operation on Mono Island and Cape Torokina, the enemy first used a mobile unit centered on aircraft carriers to attack Minamitori Island, Okinotori Island, etc., and used long-range bombers to constantly attack the Gilbert Islands. They tried to concentrate Japanese air power on the Bougainville Island area where they intended to land, within the range of possibility, so that Japan would strictly guard against this area.</p>
<p>In this way, in the Solomon and Bismarck Islands area, the Japanese bases in Palau, Rabaul, Buka, Rabaul, etc., were air raided every day, with as many as three hundred and several dozen aircraft at most. Their tactics are that when they attack with a formation of more than two hundred aircraft, fighters first fly at a considerable altitude to distract our vigilant fighters, and then our fighters chase after them and engage in fierce air combat. At this time, many fighters protect the bombers and attack at low altitude. Of course, the number of our fighters is less than theirs at this time. Although we can shoot down a few of the enemy aircraft, countless bombers drop bombs on our air bases. After the bombing, or even in the midst of the enemy aircraft bombing, the maintenance personnel, quartermaster corps members, etc., of course, rush to repair day and night, but they can't keep up with the damage caused by the hundreds of aircraft that drop bombs every day. Moreover, the enemy also drops time bombs everywhere, which explode at any time, so it is quite annoying. As a result, the bases in the Solomon Islands, Palau, Barale, etc., were destroyed by the enemy and could not be used temporarily. The enemy then landed on Mono Island and Cape Torokina.</p>
<p>The Life-and-Death Battle of the South Seas Islands</p>
<p>But although the enemy suppressed our bases in the Solomon Islands, they failed to succeed in the Rabaul area alone. In the landing operation from October 31st to the morning of November 2nd, many were shot down by our naval aircraft flying from Rabaul. Why couldn't the enemy suppress our Rabaul area? This is of course because the air power deployed by the enemy air bases in Guadalcanal, New Georgia, Utarak, Vella Lavella, Toropryan, etc., is now not fully supplied. Bases must be equipped with ammunition, gasoline, and many other storage facilities. These supplies are constantly being bombed by our naval aircraft, so replenishment is not very sufficient. That is why they dare to use aircraft carriers equipped with sufficient bombs and gasoline, at least able to carry hundreds of aircraft. They actually disregarded the iron rule that aircraft carriers cannot easily enter the territory of enemy air bases and attacked with two aircraft carriers at the same time, showing their determination to seize our important strategic strongholds and take Rabaul in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>This is a desperate tactic that cannot be underestimated. Fortunately, thanks to the outstanding command of our operation headquarters and the great activity of naval aircraft, we were able to defend it. The enemy still has many aircraft carriers, and they will probably appear one after another. In response, from now on, our soldiers must make their best efforts.

<p>Central News Agency News - After the National General Commercial Control Association's Flour and Wheat Special Committee implemented the purchase of wheat, it distributed the purchased wheat to flour mills in the Jiangsu and Anhui areas to produce flour, collected and implemented the allocation for civilian needs, to assist civilian food supplies, and provide genuine benefits to people's livelihoods, which is no small feat. Regarding the Shanghai flour allocation matters, before a proper solution was obtained, the Flour and Wheat Special Committee still calculated the quantity of flour to be allocated and allocated to the original Shanghai Wheat Flour Control and Allocation Association, distributing the flour to each responsible district according to population to ensure supply. Now, in order to improve the allocation mechanism and achieve strict flour allocation according to population, the Shanghai Flour Industry Association, in accordance with the Flour and Bran Centralized Allocation Plan promulgated by the National General Commercial Control Association, sent representatives to meet with representatives of the Japanese Shanghai Wheat Flour Control and Allocation Association to discuss and decide to jointly establish the "Shanghai Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office". Members of the Flour and Bran Group of the Flour Industry Association will be selected to participate as six Chinese representatives, and five Japanese representatives will be selected to participate, to jointly prepare for the organization. After being approved by the Business Coordination Committee, it was officially established yesterday (the 15th) to handle flour allocation matters for Chinese and Japanese merchants and residents in the Shanghai area. The Unified Allocation Office is located on the fourth floor of the Wanhe Building on the Fourth Road. It is said that the office is directly under the guidance of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee to handle unified allocation tasks.</p>

<p>P&gt;Eighth District Baojia Authorities Promulgate Key Points for Self-Policing and Guard Duty, Baojia Personnel Must Handle Affairs Impartially</p>
<p>The Eighth District Baojia authorities, in order to actively promote the maintenance of public security within the district, have recently promulgated points to note for self-policing groups on guard duty, which have been notified to the Lianbao chiefs for implementation from now on. The Shanghai News Agency reporter records them as follows: The division chief of the Ohatake Branch has ordered a change to a three-time period system, which has not yet been unified. It should be implemented uniformly and without discrepancy. No substitutes are allowed for guard duty. Ensure thorough consultation. Store managers, factory engineers, technicians, and laborers should be treated with consideration, and those who are struggling to make a living should be accommodated by assigning them to night shifts and Saturdays and Sundays. Strict attention should be paid to double posts (if one person deserts, both are punished). Guard duty notices must be sent out early so that people can prepare and avoid making excuses. They must be delivered to the individual to avoid denial and disputes. Doctors, teachers, students, civil servants, monks, and the mentally ill are exempt from guard duty.

<h3 id="e49">Unfortunate Women and Children's Families: China Relief for Women and Children General Association <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>In a semi-feudal society, the fate of women is not guaranteed. In addition, education is not universal; women who suffer under old customs and evil forces will never see the light of the future and will not find their proper way out. "Since ancient times, beautiful women have had unfortunate lives" has become the definitive assessment of the lives of suffering women. Especially in Shanghai, which is still subject to feudal shackles and full of corrupt labor in the commercial port, there are lost sheep everywhere. Now, there are helpless women and children. Who knows that there is also a benevolent agency dedicated to teaching and helping these unfortunate women and children--the China Relief for Women and Children General Association?</p>
<p>Long History</p>
<p>Xingqiao Street, near Ningbo Road, is a prosperous street where lower-middle-class people live. It is an old "Renyi Yangtang" (Benevolence and Righteousness Orphanage), a large hall, an old-fashioned theater-style building, which gives people a sense of comfort. Now, the venue is temporarily the site of the China Relief for Women and Children General Association.</p>
<p>Talking about the China Relief for Women and Children General Association, it already has a history of more than 30 years. It was before the founding of the Republic of China. At that time, Shanghai had become a department of commerce and western difficulties. On the one hand, due to the general commercial development, the city became a gold rush in the minds of citizens in nearby small towns. Men and women flocked to it. On the other hand, due to international relations and convenient transportation, criminals gradually made Shanghai their nest. As a result, wandering and helpless women and children are everywhere, and those who are lured, abducted, sold, and even fall into the sea of misery are everywhere. It has created all kinds of family tragedies and social crises. At that time, there was a group of benevolent people who witnessed the heartache and hoped to work together to provide relief. Therefore, Song Hanzhang, Tian Zimin, Yun Sheng, He Qiushi, Xu Qianlin, etc. initiated the good cause of helping helpless women and children. Soon, they were supported by Zhu Zao, Wang Yishi, Ju Runsheng, Xie Ting, Xiang Rusong, and Lao Jingxiu, and in the third year of Xuantong, they began to organize the China Women and Children Relief Association to rescue lost and abducted women and children. Use the power of society to do social undertakings. Although they have not received government assistance, the cause has developed rapidly due to the support and support of the general public. Later, a nursing home was established at the Jade Buddha Temple near Jiangwan Railway Station. The scale was quite large and the equipment was gradually improved. Unexpectedly, after the two wars, the Association was completely destroyed. However, countless women and children in distress have been added after the war. At that time, major charitable organizations in Shanghai tried their best to provide relief, but they still felt that their efforts were far away. How could this organization, which was originally dedicated to providing relief to helpless women and children, not recover immediately? Under the urgent demands from all quarters, "China Women and Children Relief Association" sign finally appeared again in the Renyi Shantang on Xinqiao Street.</p>
<p>Target of Relief</p>
<p>China Relief for Women and Children General Association's pure work target is to help helpless women and children. The targets of relief are refugee women, refugee children, lost women and children, those who have been abducted, and women and children who are homeless and wandering the streets. According to the person in charge of the Association, there were originally six major items stipulated for relief work, namely:</p>
<p>1. Rescue: The association used to have several honest and reliable detectives who were in contact with the police at stations and other public places to rescue women and children who had been lured and abducted. This work, which is full of chivalrous spirit, has now been changed to investigation work because the local environment has changed, and it is no longer engaged in rescue by itself. Moreover, in fact, maintaining the women and children who have been rescued is not an easy task. It is also difficult to accommodate the rescued women and children sent by various charities.</p>
<p>2. Collection: After the association takes in lost and abducted women and children, after certain investigation and registration procedures, those who have a clear address will be properly sent back. Most of them will be immediately advertised for collection. As long as their family members can find a proper guarantee, they can take them back without paying any fees. For those who escaped due to intolerable mistreatment, their parents were severely advised not to mistreat them again in order to maintain humanity and justice. If this work to protect the oppressed is carried out in a righteous manner, it is truly immeasurable merit.</p>
<p>3. Repatriation: According to the person in charge of the Association, for women and children who are lost and abducted, if they can tell the detailed address, even if it is far away in another hometown, the Association will send staff to escort them back home without charging any fees. Now, due to limited funding and inconvenient transportation, they have no power to repatriate except for those near Shanghai. The above-mentioned tasks are all passive in nature. Now the full force is focused on supporting the following active education work:</p>
<p>4. Nursing: The Association treats the abducted women and children as if they were their own flesh and blood, so that the young can be taught, the strong can return, and the old can be taken care of. In the past, there were kindergartens, male nursing homes, female nursing homes, and elderly homes in the Jade Buddha Temple. Now most of the undertakings have been inherited. The young and male nursing homes are located in the Renyi Shantang, and the female nursing home is located on North Chengdu Road.</p>
<p>5. Skills: The Association stipulates that when the women and children who are supported reach a certain age, the Association will introduce them to the agreed factories or shops to learn skills, so that everyone has a skill to solve their own life problems and become good citizens of society. Now, more academic education is being added in the Association to enable them to be self-reliant after leaving the Association.</p>
<p>6. Begging for support and choosing a match. The Association stipulates that citizens who have proper occupations and status and lack heirs or spouses can apply to the Association to select suitable objects (children or wives). However, they must abide by the Association's regulations on begging for support and choosing a match, find reliable guarantors, and handle it carefully in order to protect the future happiness of the women and children who have been taught by their own blood.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years, the China Relief for Women and Children General Association has rescued and supported tens of thousands of helpless women and children. In addition to sending them to be received, begging for support, and arranging matches, and introducing them to find work in the industrial and commercial circles, the total number of women and children currently being supported is still more than 500, and the trend is increasing.</p>
<p>Economic circles Comment</p>
<h3 id="e50">Comparative wartime economy of India <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Twenty Indian economists, centered around Professor U Aman, a famous economist, issued a joint statement on India's wartime economic policy, using the Indian budget for the 1943-44 fiscal year as the theme. It describes the current situation in India as follows: The food panic that occurred in India was entirely due to the Indian government's large-scale plunder of boxed grains, the responsibility of which should be borne by the Indian government. Cotton products and products are problematic for the people because the Indian government has the right to buy them and forcibly control exports. Most of India's paper industry has fallen into a state of suspended production. Therefore, the Indian paper panic has become a serious problem.</p>
<p>Looking at the above-mentioned economic situation in India during the war, it can be seen that the Indian people are living a life of lingering on under the double attack of material shortages and inflation. Their predicament is naturally far above ours. Our food problem has indeed not been thoroughly solved. However, the government authorities have recently tried their best to solve the rice control problem. How to actively dredge the source of rice and how to actively increase the amount of rice dust are the only topics for our country to solve the people's reality today. Secondly, in terms of the people's clothing, it is natural not to use Shanghai as a representation of the national people's clothing problem, because the clothing needed by the vast majority of people in our country is not silk, wool, or Bi, but cotton and cotton cloth; since the purchase of cotton yarn cloth, the implementation of the distribution method has become a blessing that the people of the whole country are waiting for. Therefore, whether or not there is a problem with the people's clothing depends on the success of the implementation of the cotton yarn cloth distribution. Thirdly, the paper problem, which has a great relationship with culture, has recently been reported that paper mills in Central China are actively increasing production, and the results are satisfactory. Paper mills in Shanghai are also stepping up their efforts to enable Central China to be self-sufficient in papermaking. However, in order to ensure the supply of paper in the future, the whole country must save unnecessary consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen paper control.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Various Associations Prevent Black Markets: Newly Established Trade Regulations; Inventory Registered on a Periodic Basis <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Various trade associations in this city, in order to prevent their members from engaging in black market transactions, have imposed extremely strict restrictions on the buying and selling of goods between members. Recently, each association, recognizing that some members have failed to comply with the regulations, has specially formulated several new rules, advising members to strictly adhere to them; otherwise, the association will impose penalties. The key points of these regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>The buying and selling of goods is limited to fellow association members and registered goods. All transactions must be spot transactions, with same-day delivery and settlement. Forward transactions are prohibited, as is the practice of selling first and buying later, or buying first and selling later, similar to speculative transactions, in order to prevent speculation. The buying and selling locations are limited to the original markets and designated places of each association or organization; off-site buying and selling is strictly prohibited. The nature of buying and selling is divided into two types: genuine needs and nominal needs. The former refers to the direct practical consumption of the substance, and buying and selling should be based on permits, not exceeding the approved quantity. The latter refers to the circulation of funds among fellow traders, only involving transfer registration or processing and manufacturing into other commodities, without reducing the total amount of physical goods; the quantity is not limited, but both the buyer and seller must complete transfer or change registration. Prices are subject to appropriate restrictions by the association or organization. Violators will be suspended from trading. The inventory and production, buying, and selling of all goods and products by fellow association members must be registered with the association or organization. Unregistered goods will be treated as privately hoarded. The association or organization will report the registered amounts to the Federation on a ten-day basis, and the Federation will report to the Commercial and Trade Association on a monthly basis. All registered goods are the responsibility of the association or organization, the Federation, and even the Commercial and Trade Association, layer by layer upwards.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Shanghai Special Municipality Public Bonds: First Lottery Redemption Held Yesterday at the Bankers' Association <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Public Bonds for the year 1931 of the Republic of China, with a fixed amount of 10 million yuan, held its first lottery redemption at the Bankers' Association on the 15th of this month, in the presence of the public. Representatives present included Li from the Ministry of Finance, Chen Yongsan from the Auditing Department, Shen Zhenxu from the Municipal Government, Wang Boyuan from the Fund Management Committee, Zhang Pingyi from the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank, and guests from various sectors. Yuan Houzhi, Director of the Finance Bureau, was elected as chairman. The details of the proceedings are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>He stated that the issuance of public bonds was originally for the purpose of organizing municipal administration and establishing new security teams. The government aims to build the local area, promote the prosperity of the market, and strengthen public security by setting up security teams, so that every citizen can live and work in peace. However, a large amount of funding is required. At that time, the municipal treasury was very tight, so the Executive Yuan approved the issuance of these public bonds with a total value of 10 million yuan in June of the 31st year of the Republic of China. The bonds will be repaid in ten years by means of a lottery. Interest has already been paid twice, last November and this May. Today's lottery will redeem 30 bonds worth 10,000 yuan each, 125 bonds worth 1,000 yuan each, 120 bonds worth 500 yuan each, 100 bonds worth 100 yuan each, and 100 bonds worth 55 yuan each. Those whose last two digits of the bond number match the drawn lottery number will be the winning bonds for the first redemption. The total redemption amount is 500,000 yuan, which can be collected from the Shanghai Central Reserve Bank or the Shanghai Fuxing Bank at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Lottery Situation</p>
<p>Each supervisor examined the lottery tickets and the bottom sheets of the tickets. Representatives from the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank, Shanghai Fuxing Bank, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Bankers' Association, and Money Trade Association took turns drawing one ticket each.</p>
<p>Winning Numbers</p>
<p>The winning numbers for the first lottery are "27," "03," "69," "00," and "91." Each supervisor stamped and certified the bottom sheets of the tickets separately to ensure solemnity. All winning tickets, together with the interest due, will be redeemed in cash at the end of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Leather Purchase Work Research Organization <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The leather control and purchasing organizations in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the Nanjing and Shanghai areas have recently undergone review by the Chinese-Japanese relations sector. Opinions from all parties are becoming consistent, with a Chinese-Japanese joint venture planning a leather purchase committee with a predetermined capital. However, the internal organizational system has not yet been finalized and is currently under study.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Authorities to Supply Raw Materials to Enable Factories to Resume Operations <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Preparatory Work Currently Underway</p>
<p>The relevant authorities in this city, recognizing that some factories have suspended operations due to a shortage of raw materials, which not only has a significant impact on the development of industry and commerce but also greatly affects the supply of goods and prices in the market, have taken steps to purchase a large amount of raw materials from various production areas and allocate them to factories to enable them to resume operations. Factories have already registered their monthly needs for various raw materials with the authorities. In the future, after a large batch of raw materials is transported to Shanghai, the authorities will allocate them fairly according to the registered quantities of each factory. The prices will be lower than those obtained by the factories themselves. Some factories that have been shut down are now engaged in cleaning up factory buildings, overhauling machinery, and preparing for work. At the same time, they are holding shareholders' meetings to raise capital. Once a large amount of materials is allocated, large-scale production will begin.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Trend of Chinese Stocks <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the decline in Chinese stocks expanded, showing a tendency to collapse. Credit tightened, and financial institutions rushed to sell off their holdings, causing all stocks to decline sharply. Department store and textile stocks retreated rapidly first, followed by real estate, industrial, and public utility stocks. Only the cultural industry stood out, showing an upward trend. Small denomination stocks continued to hold, with active trading. The performance of various industry stocks is recorded below.</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On Company broke through the barrier at the opening and continued to decline, remaining weak in the afternoon, eventually settling slightly above the previous day's closing. Sincere declined more than half a barrier. China Emporium rebounded slightly. China Underwear declined considerably.</p>
<p>Textiles: Wing On Textile declined steadily in the morning and weakened further in the afternoon, settling with a small amount remaining. China Textile and Sin Hwa showed excess supply, with large amounts entering the market. Liberty Textile rebounded after falling on heavy trading. Mei Ya Factory also declined slightly. Five Harmonies opened around the previous day's closing price. Small denomination stocks such as Lun Zhang, Rui Tai, Da Gong, Tian Lun, Xin Feng, and Da Zhonghua Weaving were held up by behind-the-scenes operators. Jing Fu Shirt rebounded to flat after falling, while Most Lun Cai settled slightly lower. Tuan Tuan Dyeing hovered.</p>
<p>New Industries: New Asia Factory declined slightly to the barrier. Sino-French broke through the barrier. Five Continents, Sino-Western, Sin Yi, New Star, and Jiu Fu Pharmaceuticals all showed declines.</p>
<p>Culture: Commercial Press and China Bookstore were the only ones advancing towards the high point amidst limited supply and strong demand. World Bookstore declined slightly.</p>
<p>Finance: Continental and Zhejiang both traded slightly lower. Shanghai, Jin Cheng, and Yanye.</p>
<p>Real Estate: Union Realty and Xin Yi followed the downward trend. Wing On returned to within the barrier.</p>
<p>Public Utilities: Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity fell below the barrier again. China Merchants Electricity weakened further.</p>
<p>Other: Da Zhonghua Matches declined steadily. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco also declined slightly. Jiu An Industrial also declined considerably. New Asia Construction also entered the barrier. Da Tung, Da Zhonghua Industrial, and Tuan Hwa Investment all declined. Kang Yuan Canned Goods continued to decline. Standard Monosodium Glutamate opened at the barrier. China Film rose sharply on buying, showing a unique upward trend.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Wholesale of Dried and Preserved Goods to be Subject to Price Controls <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Due to the lack of price controls on dried and preserved goods, the selling prices among traders have not been consistent, directly affecting social livelihood. In order to standardize prices and achieve effective results, the trade association for this industry has requested that wholesale prices be controlled first, so that prices can be suppressed. The association has submitted a report to the municipal authorities. It is reported that the municipal government has instructed the relevant departments to verify the matter thoroughly and then respond.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Commercial News in Brief <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday, the market continued to weaken. It is said that due to tightening credit, it is only a temporary phenomenon. Investors are nervous, causing market prices to remain weak and slowly decline. It is expected that this decline will not continue indefinitely. Yesterday, type C began to rise and then rose to the barrier. After that, it gradually declined, declining significantly compared to last weekend. Types A, B, D, and E all showed declines, but the degree of decline was generally balanced.</p>
<p>Call Loan Interest Rate: Yesterday, the Money Trade Association's call loan interest rate remained unchanged at 1.7%. Credit tightening continues.</p>
<p>Grains: The source of supply has recently been quite good. Due to reduced obstacles along the way, rice has arrived in abundance, resulting in a drop in prices, which are even lower than before. There is also a large supply of oilseeds, and cargo owners are eager to sell, but buyers are few, making it difficult for the market to rally.</p>
<p>Dried and Preserved Goods: Recently, due to more arrivals and slow sales, there has been no improvement. Buyers are few and far between, and the market is very sluggish. Government-issued red dates fell below eight barriers yesterday. Other details are available upon request.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk: Yesterday, it turned stable, with mostly scattered transactions. The opening price was the same as the previous report.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: The distribution of matches and soap is being delayed because the authorities are still sending personnel to investigate the goods in stock. Although sales are quite sluggish, the needs of residents in this city are strong, so some retailers with goods for sale are selling Phoenix brand matches at surprisingly high prices per small box. The soap market is also continuing to rise. As for the cigarette market, it remains stagnant, as the allotted goods arrive on schedule, so there is no panic. A large number of miscellaneous brands from other ports have arrived, and sales have been slow as a result. Therefore, Zhonghua, Da Ying, Lao Dao, and Qian Men brands have seen stable to weak performance. Old cigarettes such as Quan Lu and Jin Qiang are rarely inquired about. National cigarettes such as Jin Die and American cigarettes are selling well due to limited supply. The market is lively.</p>
<p>Green Tea: Yesterday's tea market was buoyant, continuing the strong performance of the previous report. Coupled with the good color of the tea, merchants were still eager to bid, so the gate was united in buying and selling, with a happy atmosphere. As a result, various colors of tea were promoted greatly compared to the end of the previous report. It is estimated that 44 dan of fried green tea were traded from Water Street, etc. At the same time, there were still 15 tael of natural pearl mustard seed. The transaction price varied depending on the quality. The goods were sold by tea shops such as Zhenhua Chun Ji and Gong Chang. As for Keemun black tea, although buyers intended to be active, the holders of the goods were motivated by the green tea market and pushed up sales efforts. Therefore, in this situation, the future sales price will also be firm.</p>

<h3 id="e59">The Truth About the British and American Air Forces Stationed in India <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Osawa Kanzou</p>
<p>Between last October and June of this year, before the rainy season began in Burma, Japanese army aircraft shot down countless enemy combat aircraft and jointly launched expeditions to Meng-Mei-Jin-Ki, Calcutta, Kunming, and other places, inflicting significant damage on the enemy air force. Although the enemy air force's technology is poor, they try to compensate with a quantitative advantage, desperately replenishing the number of aircraft shot down and destroyed. As Burma entered the official rainy season, enemy combat observation aircraft conducted guerrilla warfare despite the adverse weather, and enemy bomber squadrons stubbornly launched attacks, mainly targeting our transportation lines such as railways, bridges, and ships, conducting blind bombing.</p>
<p>The number of these blind bombings totaled 182 times (856 aircraft) in June, and approximately doubled in July, totaling 312 times, with the number of aircraft increasing to 1158.</p>
<p>This shows that the enemy is actively replenishing its air power. The number of first-line aircraft was approximately 650 in May (including 150 American aircraft), increased to approximately 1000 in June (including 350 American aircraft), and approximately 1300 in July (including 450 American aircraft), with a total increase of approximately 300 aircraft per month. The situation in August of this year is known in more detail and is recorded below:</p>
<p>Eastern India Front: Approximately 500 first-line aircraft.</p>
<p>British Air Force (fighter aircraft: 130 aircraft, bomber aircraft: 100 aircraft, other: 20 aircraft).</p>
<p>American Air Force (fighter aircraft: 80 aircraft, bomber aircraft: 100 aircraft, other: 100 aircraft).</p>
<p>Ceylon Island Front: Approximately 1200 first-line aircraft.</p>
<p>British Air Force (820 aircraft, including approximately 100 Indian troops).</p>
<p>American Air Force (more than 400 aircraft).</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the air power in India is approaching 2,000 aircraft, and its strength should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Subsequently, due to the withdrawal of forces from North Africa and the shortening of the Anglo-American air force replenishment route through the Mediterranean after Italy's exit from the Axis powers, the enemy's replenishment became more active, and the bombing of Burma became more intense. The silence of the Japanese army air force during the rainy season has now suddenly become active.</p>
<p>Vulnerable Enemy Warplanes</p>
<p>At the beginning of the air war in Burma, the British Air Force was the main force. After the past two seasons, the Curtiss P-36, Curtiss P-40K, and Hurricane IIB appeared. The characteristics of various fighter aircraft are mostly similar to American-made aircraft.</p>
<p>The Curtiss P-36 is stronger than the Brewster Buffalo and P-40, but is ultimately no match for Japanese aircraft.</p>
<p>The K-type, a successful modification of the Curtiss P-40, has performance that is not yet fully understood. It is equipped with four 20mm machine guns in the wings, making it quite nimble. It is considered an excellent model along with the Hurricane IIB, but it is still insufficient compared to Japanese fighter aircraft.</p>
<p>The skill of enemy fighter pilots is extremely poor, especially the British fighter pilots. In the previous air battle over Duha Rongli, eight Japanese fighter planes ambushed a formation of sixteen enemy fighter planes, shooting down eight of them and causing the rest to flee. However, in this battle, not a single Japanese fighter plane was hit by enemy fire. Moreover, facing an outdated situation, the enemy was very advantageous. From this change of adverse situation and the great results obtained, it can be seen that there is a great difference in skill between the two sides. The air force gave instructions to its fighter planes. . "When you find a Japanese plane above you, prepare to bail out with a parachute? Also, if a Japanese plane is behind you, turning around is equivalent to death. If you want to engage, you must first try your best to escape, and then turn around. Secondly, when attacking Japanese planes, attack from the rear and above, and then leave immediately"!</p>
<p>Also, when requesting Hurricane fighter planes . . "Never engage in close combat with enemy single-engine fighter planes, but only attack enemy bombers". This is the equivalent of telling others not to dare to engage with Japanese fighter planes.</p>
<p>As a result, the enemy fighter plane lineup of the British and American sides, the crews and their capabilities of the British and American sides are not a problem. British fighter squadrons can only cooperate in combat in close-range enemy areas. American fighter squadrons are responsible for the air defense of key airfields around Calcutta, so the enemy fighter squadrons ultimately cannot fly the main task of active air combat.</p>
<p>Other fighter planes include the American P-43, P-66, and the British Buffalo twin-engine fighter plane, but the first two are extremely few in number. The Buffalo model initially served for the air defense of Calcutta, and then roughly formed a team of two aircraft, using their armor to specialize in strafing the ground on the front line, but this is not a problem. In short, the enemy fighter squadrons are actively restoring combat power in the rear.</p>
<p>Status of Enemy Bombers</p>
<p>In contrast, the organization of the enemy bomber squadron is worthy of vigilance.</p>
<p>Since the end of last year, the United States has been actively increasing its air power stationed in India. The British Blenheim, which initially appeared on the Burma front, has now been replaced by large heavy bombers such as the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, North American B-25 Mitchell, and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. Most of the blind bombings mentioned above were carried out by the US Air Force.</p>
<p>Approximately two seasons later, relying on its enormous production capacity as a background, on average, more than 100 aircraft were simultaneously deployed in large formations to blindly bomb long-distance targets, key points related to transportation, production, and replenishment.</p>
<p>The most common enemy bomber on the Burma front is the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, which is the bomber that we are most familiar with, frequently appearing in the skies over the entire territory of Burma. Generally, its altitude is between 5,000 and 6,000 meters. Eight or nine aircraft form a team, creating a single vertical line formation in a three-aircraft triangle formation to attack. Sometimes, three aircraft form a team and approach from various altitudes and directions.</p>
<p>The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress appears frequently in the Pacific, but very much in the Burma front. On June 4th of this year, it appeared in the skies over Yangon, and after shooting down two of them, it disappeared.</p>
<p>As for the B-24 and the North American B-25 Mitchell, which are very familiar in Tokyo, they appear more often in upper and central Burma. The reporter often saw these formations in central Burma.</p>
<p>Other bombers include the British Vickers Wellington, but because it is an old model, it only appears in central Burma at night, which is insignificant. It is not yet clear whether the American Douglas A-20 is in the Indian front. It is unlikely that India has this type of aircraft. The B-26 has not yet been discovered.</p>
<p>It is said that the new British aircraft De Havilland Mosquito has been discovered. We only received a radio message saying: "A new bomber, the Mosquito, has appeared, pay attention!", but it has not yet been seen on the battlefront. After the rainy season, perhaps they will come to bomb with a number of each squadron. The old Blenheim model has been modified into the "Bisley" model after increasing the horsepower of the engine, but it is still a very old model. The British Blackburn Skua dive bomber squadron was deployed in the Akab area, more in the nature of an experiment.</p>
<p>In reality, it is the US Air Force</p>
<p>Thus, in reality, the real entity of the enemy air force in the Indian front has been replaced by the US Air Force, which is at the beginning of the war with the British Air Force, and its center is the US bomber squadron, with the B-24 and B-25 models. However, as the fighter plane situation, as mentioned above, is not enough to form a joint formation with the bomber squadron, it can only rely on its heavy armor to attack.</p>
<p>These bomber squadrons are distributed in more than 90 airfields built within a 60-mile radius around Calcutta, strengthening air surveillance, and air defense fire is quite complete, and is equipped with short-wave warning devices. These more than 90 airfields, each aircraft, is in fact a group of airfields one by one. When one of these airfields in the airfield group is bombed, fighter planes immediately fly out from another airfield to intercept. As an example: the airfields used by the US 7th Bombardment Group include Qiabua, Tehassali, Agartala, and Qilir, etc. (Those marked with 〇 have night lighting equipment.) The bases used by the British include Chitaguan, Feni, Agola, and Sherchia, etc. (To be continued) (翔: Translated from the November 7th Asahi Weekly)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Wartime House Leasing Law <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xiangzhi</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Chen Bomin's "Discussion on Article 7 of the Wartime House Leasing Law" in this month's 5th issue of the National Forum, I cannot help but feel the weakness of the traditional Chinese concept of law. Regardless of the contradiction between right and wrong, people follow their own likes and dislikes, considering what benefits themselves as right and what benefits others as wrong. The disputes and chaos are endless, and there is no fixed definition of right and wrong. China today is suffering from a lack of attention to rules and agreements from the top to the bottom. People are trying to achieve the unreachable ideal of governing with morality and regulating with propriety to govern the people of today who are far removed from the Three Dynasties. As a result, it is impossible to expect those who make the laws to abide by them.</p>
<p>Focusing on the matter at hand, although the second and third paragraphs of Article 450 of the Civil Code regarding house leasing have not been repealed, the court has never adopted them since the incident. Although tenants have benefited greatly, second-hand landlords have profited even more. However, in terms of the rule of law, what are the gains and losses? I have never heard of anyone who loves propriety without loving the sheep, coming out to discuss it. Is this a good phenomenon? The promulgation of this Wartime House Leasing Law is not that the government is aware of the suspicion of trampling on the law, and rather issues a clear order to amend it, in order to emphasize the spirit of the rule of law. Looking at its contents, it not only protects the peace of residence, but also gives the owner a considerable benefit. The legislator takes both sides into account, and really gets the fairness of the matter, which cannot be easily discussed.</p>
<p>For example, the law allows second-hand landlords to get 50% of the net profit, which the speaker ignores and tacitly approves of. However, for the owner, although it is acknowledged that the rent is low and the loss is too large, only a reasonable rent increase is allowed to compensate for the loss, and no profit is allowed. Is this an unbiased comment?</p>
<p>When it comes to the allocation of daily necessities to stabilize people's livelihood, I only see the authorities' regulations and price limits. Whether for producers or sellers, a certain profit is allowed, and I have never seen anyone discussing its faults. Only for those who own real estate, they are only allowed to have losses and no profits. What kind of logic is this? In short, to discuss things, one must be fair, just, and forgiving, otherwise, it will inevitably be a one-sided discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Change the Calculation of Household Rice to Jin and Liang <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Zhichao</p>
<p>Our store is a household rice merchant in the third district (Zhabei). In October, we received 34 packages of household rice and 150 packages of household flour in two installments. The profit is set at 18 yuan per package of rice and 10.2 yuan per package of flour, for a total profit of 2,142 yuan. After deducting the rice and flour transportation costs (2 yuan per package) totaling 368 yuan, monthly membership fee of 150 yuan, inspection fee for the supervisory authority investigator (50 yuan per installment of rice, 10 yuan per installment of flour) totaling 120 yuan, 15 yuan returned for empty hemp bags, and 50 yuan for rice certificates, flour certificates, and paper costs, the net profit in October was only 1,439 yuan. The monthly profit for household rice and flour when they are not in short supply is even less than this. How can this 1,400 yuan maintain the store's water, electricity, rent, food, and salaries? Moreover, household rice merchants cannot also engage in black market rice.</p>
<p>The price of household rice has increased from 252 yuan per picul to the current 800 yuan per picul within a few months. The cost has increased by more than three times. After the increase in the price of household flour, the profit has increased from 2.8 yuan per package to 10.2 yuan. However, the profit for household rice has remained at 18 yuan per package for several months. In theory, as the cost increases, the profit should also increase. As for the same allocated goods, the profit percentage of rice is different from that of flour, which is really incomprehensible. We should ask the supervisory authority to consider the suffering of rice merchants and readjust the legal profit of rice merchants so that they can maintain the minimum expenses of a store.</p>
<p>The calculation of household rice should be changed to jin and liang because there is no inconvenience in calculating household flour in jin and liang. The household rice of Japanese residents in Shanghai is also calculated in jin and liang. After the calculation of household rice is changed to jin and liang, unscrupulous rice merchants can be prevented from fraud, and rice merchants can be relieved of the suspicion of deducting measures. Currently, a dou of rice using a dou measure is 16 jin and 4 liang for Saigon rice and broken rice, and only 15 jin for red rice and brown rice. The difference is too large, so the calculation of household rice in jin and liang is beneficial and without disadvantages. (Correspondent)</p>

<h3 id="e62">Improve the Method of Distributing Clothing to Prevent Various Abuses <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Our hall has always organized various social welfare activities such as porridge distribution, clothing distribution, and small-loan loans, and has never been negligent. Winter is approaching, and the number of people requesting winter clothing is increasing every day. Our hall should distribute clothing to those who are truly in need according to their names so that they can keep warm. However, there are still various abuses, such as receiving from one place and then receiving again from another place. At this time when the value of winter clothing is extremely high, fundraising is already difficult, and there is still this phenomenon. If there is any negligence, it will be a great disservice to the good intentions of the donors. Therefore, our hall has formulated the following methods for distributing winter clothing: Those who request winter clothing must first register their detailed address, name, etc. After investigation and confirmation, it will be issued based on their own ID card. At the time of issuance, the issuing agency will stamp a small seal next to the ID card with the words "Winter clothing for a certain year has been issued" to avoid the abuse of re-issuance in the future. If there is no ID card, the person requesting winter clothing can only be sent to "one designated place" for issuance, regardless of any charitable organization, and cannot be distributed separately. If the above methods can be implemented, it can not only eliminate the above-mentioned abuse of repeated taking but also free up some items to benefit other poor people. Junhua Urgent Charity Party, Benevolent Group Qi. (Editor's note: Registering for clothing distribution can prevent abuses. The method is good. It is best to have the requesters provide a guarantor before investigating and issuing. If there is any fraud, only the guarantor will be questioned, which will be even more careful).</p>

<p>— Sun Fuji</p>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Library, located near Lin Village on Weihaiwei Road, recently purchased a three-story, double-frontage building as a branch. The opening ceremony was held on the twelfth of this month. Lin Kanghou, Lü Deng, and Zhao Guanqing, the three chairmen, presided over the ceremony. After the young calligrapher Fang Wen, a child prodigy, cut the ribbon, everyone entered the hall to attend the meeting. Lin Kanghou compared the library to a child, and the staff serving in the library to parents and nannies. Mr. Yuan gave a speech themed on "Respecting the Elderly and Loving the Young," and mentioned that Chen Chunhua's book exhibition and Qu Raokang's soccer fundraiser were the most helpful in raising funds this time. Mr. Zhao stated that the library's purpose is to assist children's individuality and cultivate good citizens through appropriate methods, and he hopes that the prepared records will focus on moral education. Subsequently, Mr. Yuan and Mr. Zhao presented scrolls with inscriptions to Yao Kang and Fang Kai as awards. Afterwards, everyone dispersed in joy.</p>

<p>Recently, the Kunqu opera performers, both male and female, in Shanghai, considering that the disciples of the Xianni Society staying in Shanghai have been out of performance for a long time, relying only on teaching opera for a living, with meager income and precarious lives, specially initiated a joint charity performance to raise funds for relief. The remaining funds will be used to repair the Suzhou Liyuan Guild Hall. It is scheduled to be held on the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth of this month, at the former Russian Club on Fuxu Road, with three evenings of continuous performances. Famous Kunqu opera singers Tingxiangguan Master, Qiu Yingqi Master, Shengchan Lay Buddhist, Zhu Dingyi, Zhang Chuanfang, Yu Zhenfei, Zhao Jingshen, Zhu Chuanlu, etc., will all participate in the performance.
