<p>社評</p>
<h3>論德蘇戰爭及其趨勢</h3>
<p>上月二十二日德國軍事當局在招待新聞記者團席上，，曾明白指出，戰局之中心，依然在德蘇戰綫，正與我們一向所强調的相合。所以，雖然一般人的視綫還集注於西西里與義大利問題，我們就世界戰局之全面形勢來看，却仍不得不喚起大家對於東綫的重視。東錢這種對於世界戰局之決定性的力發，至今還是存在，也許更加軍要了。</p>
<p>東綫戰事，自上月五日起，以中部奧勒爾區為中心，重趨激烈，不久，戰事即伸展至庫爾斯克，貝爾格勒特南方，全綫延長達二百五十公里。上月中旬以後，戰綫史有發展，北方則有列寗格勒區戰事之轉劇，南方則有古班橋頭堡及米沃斯河戰事之激烈演出，至本月初，蘇軍更被逼在南綫向哈科夫防綫採取攻勢。縱觀東綫一個月間的激戰，已經可以看出雙方戰爭狀况之劇烈，犧牲之慘重。但更應注意的，第一是在本月初，德軍從奧勒爾，貝爾格勒特兩區的突出陣地，收縮陣綫。據最少的估計，德軍因此全少可以節約四十個師團兵力，用在他們認為更重要的地方。第二是一般認為夏季是德軍採取攻勢和蘇聯避免決戰的時期，但今年的夏季，情形完全相反，德國已一變已往深入長驅的戰略，利用其精銳的武器和彈性的戰術，以殲滅蘇軍的主力為重心。一個月來，蘇聯在其被動的攻勢中，冒了慘重的損失與犧牲。相反的，德方則以逸待勞，節約兵力，準備到必要時機作最後勝利的決戰。因此，我們今日評斷德蘇戰爭前途的時間固然還嫌過早，但是大體上勝利的趨勢，決不能以表現和局部事態來立論的，我們必須看到前面。</p>
<p>德蘇戰爭的決定因素，是　蘇聯反攻力之强弱，　第二戰綫之效果，　歐洲要塞之自給力如何。這幾個因素，第一是屬於蘇聯方面的，第二是屬於反軸心國方面的，第三是屬於軸心國方面的。以蘇聯的反攻力而言，要作結論是不容易的。在具有世界最大戰鬥力的德蘇兩國中，二年以來大規模的連續戰爭中，舉凡人的，物的資源之慘重的損失，也決非數字所能表現，加以蘇聯對於本國一切向不以眞面目示人，要作正確論斷，自非易事。不過就一般軍事及經濟常識而言，兩年餘以來，德軍已從對方奪到波蘭全部及包含烏克　的歐俄廣大豐僥的地區，而國內除了英美的空襲以外，未遭何等嚴重的損害。蘇聯則完全相反，雖然工業及農業的新設施，業巳在以烏拉爾及西伯利亞為中心的大後方地區樹立起來，但在前綫，在國內被破壞的事實來看，其情境自與德國不同，捉襟見肘之苦，雖蘇聯報章雜誌，亦不能不承認。所以，在戰爭之初期，或者軸心軍利於閃擊速決，可是時至今日，持久戰已於軸心有利，蘇方不得不孤注一擲，否則，戰爭愈延展，他們本身就是一個不了之局。不如德國，究竟還有一個完整的本國？</p>
<p>然而，蘇聯的戰鬥力能緊張或强化到什麽程度呢？現在，蘇聯已經迫不及待的在夏季改取攻勢了。一般軍事家經騐地認定，在攻擊方面，必須要緊張起較防禦方面大過三倍的兵力，而觀乎最近一個月以來蘇聯在奧勒爾，貝爾哥勒特，及哈科夫前綫慘重的犧牲，這種攻勢能支持到幾時，實為極大問題。支持攻勢的要素是　人的資源，　軍需的供給，和　最短的供應路錢。從人力資源方面看，蘇聯在開戰當初號稱一億九千二百萬人，超過德國一倍以上，但自自俄羅斯，彼薩拉比亞，烏克蘭，古班等地區的喪失，約須减少人口四千萬，加以戰爭中紅軍之損失，據本年六月二十二日蘇聯當局公布戰死及失踪者共四百二十萬人，依據戰爭經騐，傷與死的比例為三與一，則更須除去傷病兵員一千二百六十萬名，其中不能再上前綫者以百分之三十計，為三百七十八萬，合計絕對消耗數七百九十八萬。又據德方報吿，俘虜達五百三十六萬五千名，則合計蘇方人員損耗巳達五千萬各，所以蘇方人的資源方面，未能表示樂觀；其能依緊急訓練而支持反攻，從精銳的德軍中取得最後勝利，就運蘇聯當局也知其非易，所以近來繼續强調所調第二戰綫。至於軍需品之補給，最近蘇方巳不諱言仰給於英美者極大，而據美方公布，自一九四一年十月至本年四月，對蘇援助輸出額為十一億二千三百萬美元，其中百分之五十七為航空機及戰車，至去年底為止，共輸蘇飛機二千六百架，戰車三千二百輛，但據德方推算，開戰以來，紅軍喪失飛機四萬架，戰車三萬輛，可見美國所助者，尙不及其損失的十分之一。相反的，德國的軍需資源尙極充足，他擁有羅馬尼亞油田，法國的亞爾撒斯油田，及最近發現的烏茵附近油田；另一方面，積極開放佔領區，並正準備扶助烏克蘭獨立，並以烏拉索夫為領袖，組織義勇軍，巳達五十萬人，堅持所謂守勢建設戰，以乘蘇軍之懈而進行大決戰。</p>
<p>從德蘇雙方實力的檢討，我們可以推想，不僅今日東綫戰爭，依然為戰局的決定勢力，而且，在未來終將演出決定性的最後之戰，決非西西里或北非之戰所可比擬。斯達林在不斷整刷其政治與軍事，並在蘇報喊出了「速　歐西戰綫」的口號，可見其焦急不安，更驚人的戰事，還在後頭哩！</p>

<h3>北京通訊　北京人</h3>
<p>— 學子</p>
<p>北京人至少有三個意義。</p>
<p>第一是曹禺所作的劇本「北京人。」這劇最近由「四一劇社」在北京西長安街長安大戲院出演。以北京人所組織的「四一劇社」在北京來扮演「北京人，」頗受一般人的歡迎。</p>
<p>北京的猿人</p>
<p>第二所謂「北京人，」就是北京房山縣周口店所發現的原始猿人。這發現的起源是民國十一年瑞典安特生博士在周口店所發現的猿人大牙。那時候因為只有一個大牙，雖然安特生博士自信其為原始猿人的遺骸，但一般的考古學家，如法國的德日進神父，對此却拘着懷疑的態度。然而自從民國十九年步達生敎授在周口店發現差不多完整的猿人頭蓋骨後，這打破考古學和人類學記鋒的大發現就哄動了全世界，而德日進神父也就不再懷疑這二十萬年　（有人謂四十萬年甚至於五六十萬年前一所遺留下來猿人的遺骸了。這個量重的學術的發現物一向是由步達生敎授保存在協和　學院人類學硏究室的倉庫裏。隨着大東亞戰爭的爆發而封閉協和醫學　的時候·日本東大長谷部言人博士曾抱了一腔熱誠想去參觀而保管這北京人的頭蓋骨·然而他却發現這頭躉骨已經不翼而飛，只有模　存在。於是，這「北京人」的踪跡又成為一個難於解答的謎了。</p>
<p>據一代人的猜測，這一北京人」仍是藏匿祚中國培內。因為據調查·知道當昨羅氏基金委員會的秘書喜羅希柏克氏雖然確有將此頭蓋　運往美國的企圖，然而沒有成功。喜氏曾於民國三十年十月下旬親到協和人類學研究室把這些骸骨裝入兩個木箱，搬入協和的地下儲藏室。那一年的十一月下旬又由協和醫學院事務長把這木箱移至東交民巷美國兵營。後來美兵奉命撤進，北京美國兵營的阿休斯脫大佐就指揮美兵把子强被服等物運往天津和秦皇島，而由天津某洋各　手博運·大東亞戰爭總算是把獎兵的　路　絕了。然而　查美國兵　和天津某洋行却並沒有這「北京人一閒戰以來，由　出洋的輪船只有開往馬尼剌的啥利遜號和兩艘交換船。前者業經日方扣留，而後者也曾經過詳細的檢查。然而「北京人」仍無下落。不過照這情形看來，沒有出境是最可能的事。然而到底是祚那裏呢？關於這則有許許多多的傳說。本月二日「晨報」記者曾以阿休斯脫之被收容於上海俘虜收容所，認為「或已被其携至上海附近」。果爾則此長留北地幾十萬年的「北京人」扣因此次戰爭而變成「海上厲公」了。</p>
<p>文化人的性格</p>
<p>第三就是生長在北京的北京人了。不過這北京人的解說也很難確定，因為許多住在北京的人都於從外地搬來的。可是，大體說起來·北京人確是可以成為一個單位的。因為一般在北京住久的人都具有一種特殊的性格。這性格是到過北京的人沒有不體會出來的·用一個奇怪的字來說·北京人是「文化人」。然而這裏所說的　文化人」却並不一定指能夠寫幾句「我的妹妹啊！你的眼睛就好　我每天不忍釋手的兩塊圓亮的大洋錢！」這一類詩章的人。文化其實就是文飾。你只要一到北京，就可以覺出這此「文化人」是怎未樣的慢吞吞，怎末　的文縐縐，不但是宦門貴　，就是販夫走卒甚至於洋市夫都是那未樣的謙恭有體，而且說起話來，都是那末樣的合式。這學的　化子看見一個洋服革履的靑年，就會說。「先生，好心，將來會當校長！」（　是我前此時　親耳聽見的）這裹的飯館走堂對於盡興而退的顧客會行一個九十度的鞠躬。就是在困苦的時節也不會失去這　風度比方其說中，有倒的斃居在然路在旁手的中人，緊　着他的鳥籠，而我們也沒有聽見過他們在臨死之前曾經有過什麽怨言恨語·也就是因為的了這環境種之性下格，我在們這困聽難過不少有趣的故事。</p>
<p>洋車夫的喜劇</p>
<p>比方說，前些日子有一個年靑的太士晚上出外歸家；因為家住在邊僻的地方，到了人靜的處所、拉她的洋車夫就忽然對她打刦起來。然而這打刦的行為却是非常賺恭·有禮的。車忽然停下來了。撲赤一聲·洋車夫就跪在地下、說：「太太！我活不了，調您幫忙！」女人帶着戰慄的聲音囘答。。「您拿着去吧！」洋庫夫拿過鈔票，數了一數，又是謙恭有禮的說。「太多了，這是二百塊錢還給您·我拿一百塊錢就　了！」這實在是別開生面的打刦法，無怪乎當這位士太把車夫的號數報吿給警察的時候　這警察就對她說：「就您願意給他錢、他還送還您二百塊·那算刦？」然而這種打刦法也只有北京人做得出·而月在北京却是普遍的現象。因為我們還可以聽見其他同類的故事·我的朋友就吿訴我一個比這更為如文的把戲。演戲的生角又是一個太太和洋車夫。時間和地點雖不同，情形却一樣、車夫放下車的時候，也是一樣的說：一請您繁忙！」接着也是帶着戰慄的女人聲音：「您　着去吧！』不過，　一次却並沒有數，也沒有還。洋車夫接過了錢就出　的問她：「太太您還要到那兒去？這些地方不大安靜，我暗着您·再拉您同去好了！下一次晚上眞不要一價人出門！」說完也居然不慌不忙的送了這位太太一程·另外，東四牌樓的搶食，也是同樣的作風。手中拿着的食品，一不留心，就有從人身邊給你搶去。搶了之後·却就不慌不忙的盪來濤去昻着頭大嚼起來。有時候·更有赴的·搶來的東四還可以常街售賣，甚至於可以當給被搶的人，而且遠可以有一段「商業談判」，成交不成交，還要看談判的結果如何。這被搶的人也就很願育的笑着和他講價。路上的行人也來幫着交涉、甚至於維持治安的警察也站在外圈用着他的冷眼在靜靜的觀察　寡喜劇的扮演。不必　。這此北　漢，當我看見這種情形的時候，也不禁會心的一笑。這種情形不但是見於　西牌樓，其他熱鬧的地方也都可以見得到、昨天我到隆福寺去趕廟會就過見與此類似的一幕戲。當時我的腦筋裏就立刻湧出了一　觀念：「這是北京人！」（七月三十一日）</p>

<h3>英首相邱吉爾　抵達加拿大　先與加首相討論戰事不久將赴華盛頓會商</h3>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社急電　據加拿大魁北克消息，英首相邱吉爾已抵達該地，與加總理金氏，討論戰事。其後又將赴華盛頓，與羅斯福總統會談。與邱吉爾同行者，有邱氏之夫人及其女公子瑪利，暨顧問多人，此為邱氏第六次與羅斯福總統會見，上次會見，係於三個月之信，在華盛頓舉行，據官方發表文告透露，與邱氏同行者·有戰時運輪大臣李特軸爵，及英軍之參謀長等。此次會談·將分兩次舉行，先由英加兩方會晤·然後再由英美會見。邱氏抵達後·曾與高級官員會見、討論會議辦法。同時據華盛頓消息稱，維斯福總統昨日招待報界時宣稱：此次會議，僅係英美雙方會議，蘇聯並不遺派代表參加。總統又云·渠已接獲加總理金氏之電話·謂英首相已抵達加拿大、渠不久門將與邱氏曾見。但渠不能宣佈其時日云。</p>

<h3>維亞茲馬進攻蘇軍　遭德猛攻擊潰　卡科夫南一公里德蘇軍展開拉鋸式猛烈白刃戰</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　德軍當局，昨對東錢戰局，表明見解如次。東綫夏秋作戰之重點，仍為奧勒爾西南西北兩地區，及貝爾哥將特地區。德蘇兩軍，現於極狹窄之地方　開戰爭、奧勒爾地區之蘇軍，漸次擴大戰錢。維亞茲馬西南之蘇軍，於九日以卞一個師之兵力，實行攻擊、遭德軍猛攻，全被舉漬。又蘇軍十日晨，在基羅拂地區，亦展開大攻勢，自寒夫斯克至維亞茲馬四南之德軍防額綫，到處均遭受攻擊，然德軍之消耗戰術，仍獲相當成果。僅在奧勒爾維亞茲馬中問之戰錢，即擊毀蘇軍坦克車百零三輛。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十一日中央社電　據前綫消息，東所展開之大規模攻防戰，現在確趨激烈，蘇軍於十日夜，屢次抽調新銳兵力，分五路　迫，其主力部隊，跑卡爾科夫南僅一公里，現正與德軍郊外防禦隊展開拉鋸式之猛烈白刃戰。又蘇軍在奧勒勻西方，企圖追擊德軍之緩慢退避戰術，兩軍正於布利安斯克及奧勒爾西方，繼續激戰中。又傳蘇軍在維亞茲馬西方，及西南方，又調　大軍向斯摩倫斯克作大規模進攻，故東綫兩處戰局，現已至重大階段。</p>
<h3>英國悲劇餘論　德富豬一郞</h3>
<p>自我陶醉的英國</p>
<p>無論怎樣貶價英國人總是建造世界大帝國的人民·具有偉大的歷史。然而他們却陶醉在這裏面了。那就是說：偉大的歷史麻痺了英國人，使英國人中毒，昏醉，終於發生了自毀作用而成為一種禍患。克倫威爾說：「使彈藥乾燥，信賴神罷！」然而現在的英國人忘却了使彈藥乾燥這件事。他們是否信賴神·姑暫勿論。但他們信賴歷史。然而任何偉大的歷史。在荒念放浪的英國人看來、並無什麽功德。他們在海中，有「阿爾瑪達」「特拉法爾伽」，在陸上、有「薄倫海」「滑鐵路」，數次歷史的大勝利，然而這一點也沒有用處。今日祇有　扣克之歷　的大收北·一新世界人士的耳目。</p>
<p>茍安一晶貽禍百年</p>
<p>所有科學的發明者，英國人雖不能說是唯一者，但在其歷史上是佔着第一位的。遠如牛頓，瓦特，喬治，史蒂文生，近如法拉第，開爾溫卿等，不僅在學術的範疇內，即在利用厚生上，有賴於其發明者，實非淺尠。例如：使今日世界的戰爭為之一　的戰車（坦克車），其發明自英國始。然而最利則見　明　　　是英國人，而是蘇聯和德國。換句話說：英國人發明之，而其敵人則利用之。世界大戰後任英國首相最久而最得人心的鮑爾溫曾議：</p>
<p>「英國人祚有危機的時候，又一旦有緩急的時候，是有用處的。他們處國雖而泰然自若。在承平時世，看如不介意者。亦無先見之明。也不月因聽到警告而小心翼翼者。他們似不作什麽準備。然一旦躍然而起時，他們育至死務使徹底卞休。其活動既不客氣，亦不容情。英國人以這秤天賦立世，並　立今日的英國及大英帝國。</p>
<p>道或道是一音　　事到。我門　不以為這是不對的。然而鮑爾溫其人以此而自稱自　，並以此而誇示於英國人，不能不說他是想錯了。使英國怠於一切準備。偷一日的茍安，而忘却　成百年的共害，自第一次世界大戰至第二次世界大戰的二十年問，泄泄沓沓，處度而過者，其罪魁禍首，究竟是誰　。至少像鮑爾滬這種人不能不說是一個主要老。</p>
<p>我行我素</p>
<p>英國人自行　痺於優越盛中。英國人自康特倍利大主敎至於販夫走卒，皆以身為英國人爲　·他們到世界各國　　於股掌之上，自以為是優越的國民，而設視　他各國人民。一入國問俗」，這話對英國人是無用的。他們到任何塲所，總是我行我素。法國的宣教師，到中國則過中國式的生活，到日本則過日本式的生活，但英國的宜敎師，無論到非洲大陸的深處也好，阿拉伯沙漠也好，格林蘭的永雪中也好，喜馬拉耶山的山麓也好，或太平洋的珊瑚礁上也好，他們總是過英國式的生活。固然，其中也有　勞倫斯者學習阿拉伯人的生活方式，普蘭特者與埃及人過同一的生活，那全然是自願的。英國人到處費弄自己的風度，甚至有强使他人相從者。所以英國人不得人心，在世界各地皆然。英國人決沒有不如道這情形的這理，他們知通得很淸楚，但仍是我行我素，這是英國人所自　的地方，山就是英國人的愉快。然而這却變成英國毀之某。</p>
<p>優越感反自毀滅</p>
<p>這邊越驚成爲英國　　的人原因·例　縱維工業。英國不僅可稱是世界第一·幾乎是專有的。蘭開夏郡的紡織工業，不僅是世界第一的工業。世界的棉花被消費於此，世界的棉紗棉布是產出於此·然而曾幾何時，從英國購入紡織機械的日本，不僅在遠東地卞騙逐了英國製造品·甚至行銷到英國的大本營曼徹斯特。英國人對此不能不盛到一點狼狙。於是召開遲太華會曦，以殖民地與本國之間，即英帝國內的自由貿易·向英帝國外的竸爭者竸爭，而擬建造起關稅障壁壘，舉一例百。他事何獨不然、鐵與煤是英國的根本、英國的富强，實由此而來，然而鐵出現了美國與德國二個大竸爭者·英國現在學落至第三位·即如煤·其發掘亦不如預料中的美滿，因此、曾訓復自用·不同人低頭的邱吉爾首相·亦不能不向國內的炭坑夫泣訴　而向之低首。學生　不及預想的緣故·不僅因勞　者貿貿的低下　且也因勞　時間的不足·與（械　　　　）</p>
<p>自大自鳴享樂無度</p>
<p>總而言之，英國人漸漸地變成了自大的自嗚得意者流，必然的結果，乃是缺乏研究心。他人的長處，常漠然不知，即　而加以注意，亦乏勇猛精進之心加以學習·而且英國人懶惰而不用功。其享樂氣分雖不一樣　但都是以憂患之身·　悄享樂。例如上流社會的週末休假·或勞　者中膳後及午後的吃茶時間，有的賽馬，有的狩獵，有的作板球戲，有的打高爾夫，有的拍網球，有的甚至跑狗·對於一切享樂設備的周到·無　不至，如英國者，可說是古今無與倫比。是以他們缺乏汲汲乎採他人之長，不甘落人後，人一己十，人十己百的向上精進的精神。這也是英國人從自我　　而來的結甲。</p>
<p>勇於責人怠於責己</p>
<p>英國人知道　有自制。例如·他們也知道應節制過最的飲酒。他們也知道在　該發怒的地合抑制　怒氣。他們也如道在困苦的時俟　該刻苦　然而他們不知道一切　省。某人曾批　格拉　　頓　　　他決無後悔」。這不是指格拉　一輕一人而說　恐怕三千幾百萬的英國人中有百分之九十九是這樣的。他們對於別人的壞事相常敏感。例如格拉特斯頓批評土耳其王而種他是一個大劊子手·亞門尼亞人被土耳其人慮殺等事，祚英國屢成為大問題。然卞百倍於此的盧殺印度人事件。却沒有人說一句話。他們相　他們所佛的完全得到神的承認。他們借神的名做强盜一殺人，犯一切罪惡，不僅以為是不錯的，而且視為是當然的。他們英國人以為”君主不能為非是憲法的開宗明義第一章，而是不僅君子，凡是英國人都不能為非，差不多是先天的賦性。</p>
<p>惡貫滿盈墮入地獄</p>
<p>如此，他們在中國偷　雅片，或强　雅片·而中國政府盡力取締時，立即以此為口實而向中國開戰·索取賠款·割讓土地·然後息事。總之·他們以為英國人是神的親戚。這優越感使英國人成為世界的偉大民族。然而使遺世界的　大民族英國人　落至地獄的深處者，也就是這優越感。無論多麼偉长的國民，一旦忘却了反省，立刻就要墮落。我們不僅在今日看到英國一個例子，閱請古今歷史上大帝國的　亡·常　刻地有這種感想。（全文完）（翔：擇自每日新聞）</p>

<h3>紗布收買後　擬訂零售辦法　政院秘書長召集談話</h3>
<p>關於此次國府決定收買棉紗棉布之實施，行政院秘書長陳春團氏，特予委托全國商樂統制總會召集本市紗布商人談話，對收買棉紗布後之零售辦法已經擬訂，同時對一切教買方針，事務所之設置，以及國府之施策等，均詳加解釋闡述。</p>
<h3>收買紗布感想</h3>
<p>自國府實施收買棉紗棉布暫行條例與實施要　公布後，全國經濟工商各界，莫不性意，中央社記者昨特走訪本市金融經濟各界，探詢此次國府實施收實棉紗棉布政策之感想，承吿如下：</p>
<p>金融界本市金融界某聞人發表感想謂：「國府實施收買棉紗　　，係為消滅國積，曾理物價首要之措置，一俟收買之棉紗棉布統　配給後，氏生之安定，經濟之復興，指日可見，尤其金融業可反正過去不良之經營，使上海廣衆游資，不得潛入投機之門，富可逐漸從事轉移投資工商實業之目標，因此金融業即循入良好環境，蓋金融業為工商業之母，工商業之興衰，足以影響整個金融業之安定，比如過去棉紗棉布投機囤積之活動，什之八九，係利用銀行錢莊流動資金，今棉紗棉布實施收買，採取平衡配給，係政府在戰時體制下，納工商業於正軌，合法經營，銀行錢莊既無投機者之慫　，金融業不良影響即無形　淸，與載時國民經濟進展的海大有裨益。</p>
<p>經濟界經濟專家李某對於國府收買棉紗棉布之感想、　為係買施戰時經濟攻策調節物資抑制物價之必要措置，直接可使物資供給正常需要，减少浪費消耗，絕　私人壟　，　牟私利，圓滑物資之流動，不再發現存多洪少之現象，問接可視物資之需求、促進生產量之增加，資產家可專事投資生產事業，紡織工廠業可因原料生產之增加，加强棉紗棉布製品之產量，經營業務富可迅速繁榮，故在一般經濟界或各界之觀念，不要棉紗棉布有多量囤積，而要生產原料運輸之圓滑。棉紗棉布製品生產量平衡，實為民生之需要，</p>
<p>商統會全國商業統制總會某要員表示買施收買棉紗棉布後，可獲之效果：　國積消滅，　絕跡投機活動，　减少市而刺激，　紗布市價可趨穩定，　供求日臻平衡，　促進紡織生產，　復興正常經濟，　增强戰時物資力量，軍需民用均有準繩、</p>

<h3>認銷食鹽　配給額數</h3>
<p>因最近囤戶轉移目光，食鹽　乏貨應市，以致人心志忑不安，僉以食鹽為調味品中最重要者，一旦斷擋，影　市民傳康頗鉅，茲悉鹽務當局除嚴厲禁絕非法團積，及抬價漁利，籲請各界協助檢舉外，一面己復運到大批食鹽，分發各子鹽店及　糟坊，按照官定最高價格每市斤不得超過一元二角五分出曾，茲將其分配辦法錄誌如次：凡認銷額石二十担以下者，每次暫予配給一担，二十一相至五十担者，暫配二担。五十一担以上者，暫配三担，售完後，憑售鹽帳册繼續領銷，此項措置，旨在防杜躉批出售，並非食鹽彥量及存貨缺乏。</p>
<h3>日駐華大使谷大使昨日公畢離滬對收買紗布曾予以協力</h3>
<p>日本駐華谷大使自於日前來滬後，　理者項公務，極形忙碌，九日出席注主席招待之日本軍官民代表懇談會，又於同。嚮應國府强制敎買棉紗棉布之措置，閱明支援園府政策全面協力方針，並就處理日僑棉紗施策典當地關係當局間進行重要協議，又關於接收租界後建設新上海種種之計劃，頗多貢獻，現以任務完舉，業於十一日上午九時二十分，搭市返京。</p>

<h3>鮑斯高慈幼會訪問記（三）</h3>
<p>鮑斯在　時他的事業已由義大利傳到法，四。英及兩美的阿根廷，巴四。智利等國。　聖歸天以一後，他的　　者不僅　　其事　，而且竭力杷它擴充，六十年來，已傳迥五大洲，五十餘國。據歐務神父說，現在眩會有紅衣主教一位，總主教九位，主敎十六位，慈幼會會士（神父，修士輔助修士脚敎授農工商的技師）。共約一萬二千餘名，全世界已有慶禮院四百餘所。工藝學校約一百三卞所，　　學校六十所，初高中及　業學校約二百所。夜校一五十餘所。高中及大學寄一宿會五十餘處，培植管理一該會人才的學校約一百所一，醫院八所，聖營四百餘所。傳教區共有十七區。輔助傳敎區為三十二區，母佑會的事業。還未計入呢。</p>
<p>慈幼會事業在中國</p>
<p>鮑斯高慈幼會的國際　會、設在義大利的都利諸　。在中國，設總會支會於澳門和上海兩地，前者為報兩區香港，曲江，昆明等處事業的中心，後者為上海。徐州等處事業的中心。現在慈幼會中華區會長為　少　神父（Rev．Fr．Charles　Brasa）據談慈幼會來華發展　　却也娓娓可聽。</p>
<p>慈幼會很早就認戲到中國來　務敎養中國貧苦兒童的重要。光緒三十二年（一九○六）。首先　前鮑主敎睛到澳門辦「無原罪丁藝學校」。民國七年（一九一八）。慈幼會據發營理韶州（曲扛）敎區。民國十四年，應陸怕鴻先生之請，始至上海。民國十六年應香港恩主敎請，接曾香港西營盤聖類馬學校。後數年得港紳何東爵士及馮平山先生等之助，建築了着名於東方各國的香港仔「兒童工藝院」。這個學院，規模宏大，人才迭出，在中國聽業學校中眞是數一數二的。至民國二十四年，又在雲南省城（即昆明）成立了慈幼會上智學校。現在，全中國慈幼會士已逮三百人以上人，其中華　會士也存五十餘人，他們所辦的事業，主要的如下：</p>
<p>澳們　有「無原　學校」，分（一）學科。。初高級小學，及初中部，學生審通共百餘名。（二）工科：分革　，　縫，太工，排字，印刷，釘書六科，學生住宿者約一百名。（三）葡人華人　　院等。</p>
<p>香港首辦者為四　　的聖類　學校，分（一）學科：有初高小及初中，學生五百餘名。（二）工科。。有拼字，印刷，釘書三科，學生約一百名。（三、　　院。其次　是香倦仔的兒童工藝院，分（一）學科、初高級小學，學生二百餘名，（二）工百名。還有香港簸箕灣的聖心學校，有神學院，哲學院，初學院及求入學院等。</p>
<p>韶州敎區，有韶州動幫初高等學校，初中學校，附設革履，裁縫耕字，印刷，釘書等科、學生共約四百人。勵軍初高及初中女校，由母佑會管理。該教區神業及學校，亦由會土管理。</p>
<p>雲南則在昆明市設有上智學校，學科方面有初高管學校學生二百餘，工料方面有木工，革履，排字，印　，釘書各科。</p>
<p>上海方面，鮑斯高　幼會的事業主要的是：（一一）楊樹浦斯高學校，（二）兩市一心巾學：（三）南翔農發學校，和（四）江灣的農藝學院。</p>
<p>鮑斯高慈幼會在中國的事業，始於二十世紀的初頭，三分之一世紀的努力，對於我國貧苦失學靑年之敎養，已經有相常重大買獻。為着推進國家民族文化與建設，不能不令人感到敬佩，也不能不對它作更深刻的了解。</p>
<p>工業後備軍的大本營</p>
<p>上海最大的工業區楊樹浦的東南，上海電燈公司，自來火公司，以及其他著名重工業輕工藥化學工業工廠的中央，雄峙着一座四層大廈，這就是工業建設後備軍的訓練所—斯考學校。雖然四週都是人工廠，但學校是在極大的曠野上，羊腸紓曲的杭州路上，菜田，荒地，篷戶和野店，充滿着鄕　風　，是極優良的修學塲所。</p>
<p>斯高學校，是在民國十四年，熱幼會　上海陸伯鴻先生之躋，而來創辦的。初設南布，民國十六年北伐軍進上海，改潛到楊樹浦，租　辯學，規模　小。到了廿二年，才旦造小處。在神父與修士們勞力奮鬥，慘淡經譬之下，才有今日的規模。現在學校分兩部，「斯高中小學」，注重科學。編制及教學內容，和普通學校相同。「斯高工藝學校」，注重工藝敎學與實習。低級三年，高級二年。民國廿三年首辦木工塲，製造鋼琴等，出品曾受社會歡迎。廿四年增辦印刷廠，業務尤為發達。廿五年增設電器工塲，現在有電器，機械，木工，排字，印刷，釘嘗等科，及音樂隊組織，成為完善的工　學院。</p>
<p>斯高學校自七七以來，議畢業三　，造就專門人材一百五十名，有的升入輔仁大學，有的就在上海工商界那務。大多數由校方介紹茶各大工廠。有一位現在任蘇州電燈廠的工程師。還有一位十九歲的雖童，人楊樹浦電力廠服務，月薪高達軍票三買元，他還白動以月薪半數捐助　校。從這事可以看　該校訓練之成功。因此，上學期學生人數大增，住　生八十名，走讀生　四百名，下學期定於九月一日開學，招生名額已增至六買名。</p>
<p>參　時正値學期，住宿生正在補習學科，各工塲的人雖不多，還充滿生氣，除了木工典印刷二部，因受社會情况影響，現在只作實習之用，沒有發揮其生產力之外，電　，機械等部，却非常活躍。師生們一早就在緊張的勞勸着。各廠的定貨，有應接不暇之勞。主要的出品是馬達，鐵鍵，風扇，熨斗，工具機械及各種零件。音樂隊正在由一位義大利樂師實行個別敎導，貧苦的學生，特別用功，他們還會愉快地給參觀者一聆國際名曲。</p>
<p>斯高舉校院長是一位熱情而能榦的義大利人　彌額神父，中文的造詣已相當深湛。敎員十七人。十二人爲華籍修士，餘爲義國和德國人，有一個愛　蘭人。　員四位，都是　籍神父。據歐神父脫。現在的事業。遼只完成理想中的五分之一，其餘的五分之四，希望在社會各界幫助之下於最短期問完成，他們希望增建校舍，增加學生名額，每學期要增加住宿的普通學科學生三百，初級工科生三百，走　的初高級工科生一千名。而工塲方面，則於電器，機械，土木，印刷之外，增設裁縫，紡織及皮革昨部。他們希望，能夠幹為部新。中國培養更多的建設幹部。</p>
<p>紅房子—新幹部的溫室</p>
<p>南市國貨路，幽靜的一大街上，最令人注自的就是那座屋　挿雲的「紅房子」，彷彿曲阜的大成殿那樣雄偉，那樣令入發生崇敬之心。這裏就是鮑斯高慈幼會所辦的另一事業一心中小學。這座學校，原是民國十四年　伯鴻先生創辦的「聖若瑟工藝學校」，常時辦學宗旨，就以救濟上海淸寒子弟，授以謀生技能，使為社會生產份子。主寺者就是鮑斯技師教授也都　該會會士學生數百，都由本市各慈善機關各火善士送去的。滬戰爆發，因地位關係，受到砲火的洗禮，右側三層大直，還有一　自頂至底，全被炸燬‘至今未能修復。刦後情况，不忍描述。</p>
<p>二十九年起，該會會士，鑒於局勢稍定，即在原地繳續開辦，現在的一心學校，就在殘破與困苦中誕生了。所收南市淸寒子弟，竟達三百餘人。主持的是校長義人帥意華神父。一位熱腸古這立心為中國苦難見童敎養事業而服務的宗敎家，他其有　常的熱情和能大，三十年秋，從耶穌敎會萬神父那裏得到五十包美麥，他就開始收容寄宿學生，從三十錄人，增到現在的一百多人，其中不少是由慈善家聞關亭先生等送去的。</p>
<p>一心學校，現有小學六敎室，初中三教室，課本與普通中小學相同。自前暑期內，一部份寄宿生在補醫各科。在初中一教室中，傳出了期爽的講師的聲音，進去一看，原來只有一個學生，而那位講師還像面對數十百人一樣認眞的敎着。太令人感激了！下課了，師生們在廣塲上散步閒談，和父子兄第一般的親熱。學校的對面，另有一列洋房，從前是陸伯鴻先生手創的正修學校，現在改作一心學校另一中學部，專收在敎的靑少年。在鮑斯高慈幼會中，原有「求入會院」之設，使有志追隨鮑聖的靑年，獲得傳敎和敎養苦難兒童的知識技能。現有學生約四十名，來自全國各省，他們都具有極大的熱誠與信心。學校左邊大厲，現在為由香港來滬的該會會士修士修習之所，都是培養新幹部的宗敎戰士，據說右三買多位呢。</p>
<p>帥校長脫。。為着繼承陸伯鴻先生的遣志，一心學校，除了潽通中小學之外，（下期招生定額寄宿生一百五十人，走讀生三百五十人，）並正在盡力籌備開辦工科，以培養專門人材。他帶記者到一問小屋，是皮鞋，裁縫，木匠的　形工塲，現定招收學生二十人，在他的努力之下，如果更能得到社會協助，不久就會發展成大規模的工藝學校　（未完）</p>

<h3>On the German-Soviet War and Its Trends</h3>
<p>On the 22nd of last month, the German military authorities stated clearly at a reception for press corps that the center of the war situation remains on the German-Soviet front, which aligns with what we have consistently emphasized. Therefore, although the general public's attention is still focused on the issues of Sicily and Italy, from the perspective of the overall situation of the world war, we still must call everyone's attention to the Eastern Front. The decisive influence of the Eastern Front on the world war still exists today and is perhaps even more crucial.</p>
<p>The Eastern Front battles, starting from the 5th of last month, with the central Orel region as the focal point, have become intense again. Soon after, the fighting spread to Kursk and south of Belgorod, with the entire front extending to 250 kilometers. After the middle of last month, the front line showed development, with the intensification of battles in the Leningrad region in the north and the fierce engagements at the Kuban bridgehead and the Mius River in the south. By the beginning of this month, the Soviet forces were even forced to launch an offensive against the Kharkov defense line on the southern front. Looking at the fierce battles on the Eastern Front over the past month, one can already see the intensity of the war situation on both sides and the heavy sacrifices made. However, what should be noted even more is, first, that at the beginning of this month, the German army contracted its front lines from the salient positions in the Orel and Belgorod regions. According to the most conservative estimate, the German army can save at least forty divisions of troops, using them in places they consider more important. Second, it is generally believed that summer is the period for the German army to take the offensive and for the Soviet Union to avoid decisive battles, but this summer, the situation is completely reversed. Germany has transformed its past strategy of deep and long drives, using its elite weapons and flexible tactics to focus on annihilating the main force of the Soviet army. Over the past month, the Soviet Union has suffered heavy losses and sacrifices in its passive offensive. Conversely, the German side is waiting at ease, conserving its forces, and preparing for a final decisive battle at the necessary moment. Therefore, it is still too early to judge the future of the German-Soviet war today, but generally speaking, the trend of victory cannot be judged based on appearances and local situations. We must look to the future.</p>
<p>The determining factors of the German-Soviet war are: 1. the strength of the Soviet Union's counter-offensive capabilities; 2. the effect of the second front; 3. the self-sufficiency of the European fortresses. The first of these factors belongs to the Soviet Union, the second belongs to the anti-Axis powers, and the third belongs to the Axis powers. Regarding the Soviet Union's counter-offensive capability, it is not easy to draw a conclusion. In the large-scale continuous war between the two countries, Germany and the Soviet Union, which have the world's largest combat power, the heavy losses of human and material resources over the past two years cannot be expressed by numbers alone. In addition, the Soviet Union never shows its true colors to the world, so it is not easy to make an accurate judgment. However, in terms of general military and economic common sense, for more than two years, the German army has seized all of Poland and the vast fertile regions of European Russia, including Ukraine, from the other side, and has not suffered any serious damage within the country except for British and American air raids. The Soviet Union is completely the opposite. Although new industrial and agricultural facilities have been established in the rear areas centered on the Urals and Siberia, the situation is different from that of Germany when looking at the facts of destruction on the front lines and within the country. Even Soviet newspapers and magazines cannot but admit the difficulty of making ends meet. Therefore, in the early stages of the war, the Axis forces may have been favorable for a blitzkrieg, but today, a war of attrition is beneficial to the Axis, and the Soviet Union has to gamble everything. Otherwise, the longer the war drags on, the more unsolvable the situation becomes for them. Unlike Germany, which still has a complete home country.</p>
<p>However, to what extent can the Soviet Union's combat power be strained or strengthened? Now, the Soviet Union has impatiently taken the offensive in the summer. Military experts generally recognize that in terms of attack, it is necessary to strain more than three times the force compared to defense. Looking at the heavy sacrifices made by the Soviet Union in the Orel, Belgorod, and Kharkov fronts in the past month, how long can this offensive last is a very big question. The elements that support the offensive are: 1. human resources; 2. the supply of military needs; and 3. the shortest supply route. From the perspective of human resources, the Soviet Union initially claimed to have a population of 192 million, more than twice that of Germany. However, since the loss of Russia, Bessarabia, Ukraine, Kuban and other regions, the population must be reduced by about 40 million. In addition, the losses of the Red Army in the war, according to the Soviet authorities' announcement on June 22 of this year, totaled 4.2 million dead and missing. Based on war experience, the ratio of injuries to deaths is three to one, then another 12.6 million injured and sick soldiers must be removed. Among them, those who cannot go to the front line again are estimated at 30 percent, which is 3.78 million, totaling an absolute consumption of 7.98 million. According to German reports, the number of prisoners reached 5,365,000, then the total personnel losses on the Soviet side have reached 50 million. Therefore, the Soviet Union's human resources cannot be viewed optimistically. It is not easy for the Soviet authorities to support the counter-offensive with emergency training and to achieve the final victory from the elite German army, so they have recently continued to emphasize the so-called second front. As for the supply of military supplies, the Soviet side has recently frankly stated that it relies heavily on British and American supplies. According to the American announcement, from October 1941 to April of this year, the value of aid exported to the Soviet Union was 1.123 billion US dollars, of which 57 percent was aircraft and tanks. By the end of last year, a total of 2,600 aircraft and 3,200 tanks were shipped to the Soviet Union. However, according to German estimates, since the beginning of the war, the Red Army has lost 40,000 aircraft and 30,000 tanks. It can be seen that the American assistance is not even one-tenth of its losses. Conversely, Germany's military resources are still very sufficient. It owns the Romanian oil fields, the Alsace oil fields in France, and the recently discovered oil fields near Vienna. On the other hand, it is actively opening up the occupied areas and is preparing to support the independence of Ukraine, and is organizing a volunteer army with Vlasov as its leader, which has reached 500,000 people, adhering to the so-called defensive construction war, taking advantage of the Soviet army's slackness to carry out a major decisive battle.</p>
<p>From the review of the strength of the German and Soviet sides, we can imagine that not only is the Eastern Front war still the decisive force in the war situation today, but also, in the future, it will stage a decisive final battle, which is not comparable to the battles of Sicily or North Africa. Stalin is constantly reorganizing his political and military affairs, and has shouted the slogan "Expedite the Western Front in Europe" in the Soviet newspapers, which shows his anxiety and unease. Even more shocking events are yet to come!</p>

<h3>Japanese Army and Air Force Preemptively Strike, US Air Force in Chongqing Heavily Damaged, One-Third of US Aircraft Lost</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Hankou, 11th - According to a report from a certain Japanese base on the 10th, starting from the 23rd of last month, Japanese army and air force formations fiercely attacked the US air force stationed in Chongqing, launching an annihilation operation. In two weeks, they thoroughly destroyed the enemy's forward aviation facilities in Hengyang, Lingling, Zhijiang, Baoqing, and Jian'ou, and shot down 43 enemy P-40 aircraft and one P-38 aircraft that came to challenge them, preventing the enemy's ambition to air raid the Japanese mainland. In this operation, the Japanese aircraft fiercely attacked Hengyang once, Jian'ou four times, Lingling twice, Zhijiang once, and Baoqing once, causing the US air force stationed in Chongqing to lose about one-third of its existing aircraft. In addition, two enemy Unified Type B-38 and North American B-25 bombers were fiercely attacked by Japanese aircraft and fled in a panic. It seems that they are increasing the supply from India. According to a Chongqing broadcast on the 4th, Chennault is going to India to seek to strengthen the air force personnel in order to resist the powerful combat power of the Japanese army's new excellent aircraft. This is enough to prove the success of the Japanese army's preemptive strike operation and the excellence of the Japanese air force, and the embarrassing situation of the US air force in Chongqing being severely attacked by Japanese aircraft can also be seen from this.</p>

<h3>Beijing Correspondence: The People of Beijing</h3>
<p>— A Student</p>
<p>There are at least three meanings to the term "Beijing People."</p>
<p>First, it refers to Cao Yu's play "Beijing People." This play was recently performed at the Chang'an Grand Theater on West Chang'an Street in Beijing by the "Forty-One Drama Society." A "Forty-One Drama Society" organized by Beijingers performing "Beijing People" in Beijing is quite popular among the general public.</p>
<p>The Peking Man</p>
<p>Second, "Beijing People" refers to the Peking Man, the primitive hominid discovered in Zhoukoudian, Fangshan County, Beijing. The origin of this discovery dates back to 1922 when Dr. Anders Zdansky of Sweden discovered a hominid molar in Zhoukoudian. At that time, because there was only one molar, although Dr. Zdansky was confident that it was the remains of a primitive hominid, general archaeologists, such as Father Teilhard de Chardin of France, held a skeptical attitude towards this. However, since 1930, when Professor Davidson Black discovered a nearly complete hominid skull in Zhoukoudian, this major discovery that broke the archaeological and anthropological record shocked the world, and Father Teilhard de Chardin no longer doubted that these were the remains of a hominid left behind 200,000 (some say 400,000, or even 500,000 to 600,000) years ago. This weighty academic discovery was always preserved by Professor Davidson Black in the warehouse of the Anthropology Research Laboratory of the Peking Union Medical College. When the Peking Union Medical College was closed due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Dr. Hasebe Kotondo of Tokyo University once eagerly wanted to visit and keep this Peking Man skull. However, he discovered that the skull had disappeared, with only a mold existing. Thus, the whereabouts of the "Peking Man" became another difficult-to-solve mystery.</p>
<p>According to the speculation of a generation, this "Peking Man" is still hidden within China. Because according to the investigation, it is known that although Mr. Shiro S. Back, the secretary of the Rockefeller Foundation Committee, did have the intention to transport this skull to the United States, he did not succeed. In late October of 1941, Mr. Back personally went to the Anthropology Research Laboratory of the Peking Union Medical College to pack these bones into two wooden boxes and moved them to the underground storage room of the Peking Union Medical College. In late November of that year, the director of the Peking Union Medical College moved the wooden boxes to the American Barracks in Dongjiaomin Lane. Later, the American soldiers were ordered to withdraw, and Colonel Ashurst of the American Barracks in Beijing directed the American soldiers to transport materials such as bedding to Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, and then transported them by a certain foreign firm in Tianjin. The Greater East Asia War finally cut off the road for the award-winning soldiers. However, neither the investigation of the American soldiers nor the foreign firm in Tianjin revealed anything about the "Peking Man." Since the outbreak of the war, the only ships sailing abroad were the Harrison, which sailed to Manila, and two exchange ships. The former had already been detained by the Japanese side, and the latter had also undergone detailed inspection. However, the "Peking Man" is still missing. However, judging from this situation, it is most likely that it has not left the country. But where is it exactly? There are many rumors about this. On the 2nd of this month, a reporter from the "Chen Bao" (Morning News) thought that since Ashurst was being held in a prisoner-of-war camp in Shanghai, the "Peking Man" "may have been taken by him to near Shanghai." If so, then this "Peking Man," who had remained in the northern land for hundreds of thousands of years, would have become a "sea ghost" due to this war.</p>
<p>The Character of the Cultured</p>
<p>Third, it refers to the Beijingers who grew up in Beijing. However, the explanation of this type of Beijinger is also difficult to determine, because many people living in Beijing moved in from other places. However, generally speaking, Beijingers can indeed be considered a single unit. Because people who have lived in Beijing for a long time generally possess a special character. This character is something that anyone who has been to Beijing cannot fail to appreciate. To put it in a strange word, Beijingers are "cultured." However, the "cultured" people mentioned here do not necessarily refer to people who can write a few lines like, "My sister! Your eyes are like the two round, bright silver dollars that I can't bear to let go of every day!" Culture is actually ornamentation. As soon as you arrive in Beijing, you can feel how slow, how affected, these "cultured" people are. Not only are the officials and nobles like that, but even the porters and vendors, and even the foreign city wives, are all so humble and polite, and when they speak, they all do it in such a proper manner. When a beggar in this place sees a young man in a Western suit and leather shoes, he will say, "Sir, have a good heart, you will be a principal in the future!" (I heard this with my own ears just a while ago.) The waiters in the restaurants here bow ninety degrees to customers who are leaving satisfied. Even in times of hardship, they will not lose this demeanor. For example, someone may collapse and die on the side of the road, still tightly clutching his birdcage in his hand, and we have never heard them utter any complaints or resentful words before their death. It is because of this environmental character that we have heard many interesting stories in this difficult situation.</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Puller's Comedy</p>
<p>For example, a few days ago, a young lady was out late at night and was returning home. Because her home was located in a remote area, when they reached a quiet place, the rickshaw puller suddenly started to rob her. However, this act of robbery was very respectful and polite. The rickshaw suddenly stopped. With a "plop," the rickshaw puller knelt on the ground and said, "Madam! I can't make a living, please help me!" The woman answered in a trembling voice, "Take it!" The rickshaw puller took the banknotes, counted them, and then said respectfully and politely, "This is too much, here's two hundred yuan back to you, I only need one hundred yuan!" This is really a novel way to rob, no wonder when this lady reported the rickshaw puller's number to the police, the police said to her, "If you're willing to give him money, and he even returned two hundred yuan to you, how can that be considered robbery?" However, only Beijingers can do this kind of robbery, and it is a common phenomenon in Beijing. Because we can hear other similar stories. My friend told me an even more refined trick than this. The actors are still a lady and a rickshaw puller. Although the time and place are different, the situation is the same. When the rickshaw puller puts down the rickshaw, he says the same thing: "Please help me!" Then there is also the trembling voice of the woman: "Take it!" However, this time he didn't count, nor did he return any money. The rickshaw puller took the money and then considerately asked her, "Madam, where else do you need to go? This place isn't very safe, I'll escort you and pull you back together! Don't go out alone at night next time!" After speaking, he actually unhurriedly escorted the lady for a distance. In addition, the snatching of food in Dongsi Pailou is also done in the same style. If you are not careful, the food in your hand will be snatched away from you. After snatching it, they unhurriedly stroll around with their heads held high, munching on it. Sometimes, even more outrageous things happen. The snatched goods can be sold on Chang'an Street, or even pawned back to the person who was robbed, and there can even be a "commercial negotiation," whether the deal is made or not depends on the outcome of the negotiation. The person who was robbed is also very willing to smile and bargain with him. The passersby also come to help mediate, and even the police maintaining order stand outside the circle, quietly observing the performance of this comedy with their cold eyes. It's unnecessary to dwell on it. When I see this kind of situation, I can't help but smile knowingly. This kind of situation can not only be seen in Dongsi Pailou, but can also be seen in other lively places. Yesterday, I went to Longfusi to visit the temple fair and saw a similar scene. At that time, an idea immediately popped into my mind: "These are Beijingers!" (July 31)</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to a report from the German News Agency cited by this newspaper, although Roosevelt and Churchill's renewed meeting is a great impetus for Britain and the United States, Stalin's absence is a major disappointment.

<h3>Soviet Troops Advancing on Vyazma Suffer Devastating German Attack, Savage Melee Combat Unfolds in Hookov, One Kilometer South of Kharkov</h3>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency: German authorities yesterday expressed their views on the Eastern Front situation as follows: The focus of the Eastern Front's summer and autumn operations remains in the areas southwest and northwest of Oryol and the Belgorod area. German and Soviet forces are currently engaged in war in extremely narrow areas. The Soviet forces in the Oryol area are gradually expanding the battlefield. The Soviet forces southwest of Vyazma launched an attack with one division's strength on the 9th, which was met with a fierce German attack and completely destroyed. On the morning of the 10th, Soviet forces also launched a major offensive in the Kirov area. The German defensive line from Khvastovichi to Vyazma in the south was attacked everywhere, but the German attrition tactics still achieved considerable results. On the battlefield between Oryol and Vyazma alone, 103 Soviet tanks were destroyed.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to front-line reports, the large-scale offensive and defensive battles unfolding in the east are indeed becoming more intense. On the night of the 10th, Soviet forces repeatedly deployed new and elite forces, advancing in five directions. Their main force is only one kilometer south of Kharkov and is now engaged in fierce melee combat with the German suburban defense forces. In the west of Oryol, Soviet forces are attempting to pursue the German forces' slow retreat tactics, and the two armies are continuing to engage in fierce fighting west of Bryansk and Oryol. It is also reported that Soviet forces in the west and southwest of Vyazma have also deployed large forces to launch a large-scale offensive towards Smolensk. Therefore, the two fronts in the east have now reached a critical stage.</p>
<h3>On the British Tragedy, by Tokutomi Iichiro</h3>
<p>Self-Indulgent Britain</p>
<p>No matter how depreciated, the British are always the people who built the world empire and have a great history. However, they are intoxicated by this. That is to say: a great history has paralyzed the British, poisoned the British, made them dizzy, and finally caused self-destruction and became a disaster. Cromwell said: "Keep your powder dry, and trust in God!" However, today's British have forgotten to keep their powder dry. Whether they trust in God or not is beside the point. But they trust in history. However, any great history, in the eyes of the dissolute and debauched British, has no merit. At sea, they have "Armada" and "Trafalgar", on land, they have "Blenheim" and "Waterloo", several major historical victories, but this is of no use. Today, only the unprecedentedly large harvest of the Kou-Kuh has opened the eyes and ears of the people of the New World.</p>
<p>Temporary Ease Causes a Hundred Years of Harm</p>
<p>Although the British cannot be said to be the only inventors of all scientific inventions, they occupy the first place in their history. From Newton, Watt, George, and Stephenson in the distant past to Faraday and Lord Kelvin in the near past, not only in the realm of scholarship but also in the use of livelihood, those who rely on their inventors are not few. For example, the tank, which has changed today's world war, originated in Britain. However, the most profitable thing is that the clear-sighted ones are not the British, but the Soviet Union and Germany. In other words: the British invented it, and their enemies used it. Baldwin, who served as British Prime Minister for the longest time after the World War and was most popular, once said:</p>
<p>"The British are useful in times of crisis and emergency. They are calm and composed in their country, and they seem indifferent in peaceful times. They have no foresight, and they do not act cautiously when they hear warnings. They do not seem to make any preparations. However, once they leap up, they are determined to do their best to the end. Their activities are neither polite nor lenient. The British have established themselves in the world with this talent, and have established today's Britain and the British Empire."</p>
<p>Saying or doing is the same thing. We do not think this is wrong. However, Baldwin prides himself on this and boasts to the British about it, and it must be said that he is wrong. Causing Britain to neglect all preparations, stealing a day of ease, and forgetting the harm of a hundred years, who is the culprit for spending twenty years from the First World War to the Second World War in a slipshod and perfunctory manner? At least people like Baldwin cannot but be said to be a major villain.</p>
<p>Going My Own Way</p>
<p>The British are paralyzed by superiority. From the Archbishop of Canterbury to the peddlers, all British people think that being British is great. They regard themselves as superior nationals and despise the people of other countries in the world. "When in Rome, do as the Romans do" is useless to the British. They always go their own way wherever they go. French missionaries live a Chinese-style life in China and a Japanese-style life in Japan, but British missionaries always live a British-style life whether they are in the depths of the African continent, the Arabian Desert, the eternal snows of Greenland, the foothills of the Himalayas, or the coral reefs of the Pacific Ocean. Of course, there are also people like Lawrence who learn the Arab way of life, and Plant who lives the same life as the Egyptians, which is entirely voluntary. The British show off their style everywhere, and even force others to follow them. Therefore, the British are not popular, which is the case all over the world. It is impossible for the British not to know this situation. They know it very well, but they still go their own way. This is where the British pride themselves, and this is the British's pleasure. However, this has become the reason for Britain's destruction.</p>
<p>Superiority Feels Self-Destructive</p>
<p>This is the reason why the more amazing Britain becomes, the more it deteriorates. For example, take the textile industry. Britain can not only be called the first in the world, but it is almost exclusive. The textile industry in Lancashire is not only the first industry in the world. The world's cotton is consumed here, and the world's cotton yarn and cotton cloth are produced here. However, how long ago did Japan, which purchased textile machinery from Britain, not only drive out British-made products in the Far East, but even sell them to Manchester, the British headquarters. The British could not help but feel a little bit of panic about this. Therefore, the Ottawa Conference was convened to build a customs barrier for free trade within the British Empire, between the colonies and the home country, and to compete with competitors outside the British Empire. Other things are no different. Iron and coal are the foundation of Britain, and Britain's wealth comes from this. However, the United States and Germany have appeared as two major competitors in iron, and Britain has now fallen to third place. Even in coal, its excavation is not as satisfactory as expected. Therefore, Prime Minister Churchill, who once vowed to never bow his head, could not help but weep to the coal miners in the country and bow his head to them. The reason why the students did not do as well as expected is not only because the workers were blindly low, but also because of the lack of labor time and (machine tools).</p>
<p>Boasting, Self-Congratulating, and Enjoying Pleasure Excessively</p>
<p>In short, the British have gradually become a self-aggrandizing and self-congratulating bunch. The inevitable result is a lack of research. They are often indifferent to the strengths of others, and even if they pay attention to them, they lack the courage and diligence to learn them. Moreover, the British are lazy and do not work hard. Their enjoyment atmosphere is different, but they are all enjoying pleasure in a worried body. For example, the weekend holidays of the upper class or the tea time after lunch and in the afternoon for the workers, some race horses, some hunt, some play cricket, some play golf, some play tennis, and some even race dogs. The thoroughness of all the enjoyment facilities is unmatched by anyone, such as Britain, can be said to be unprecedented in ancient and modern times. Therefore, they lack the spirit of seeking the strengths of others, not being willing to fall behind others, and striving to improve themselves tenfold, or even a hundredfold. This is also the result of the British's self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>Brave in Criticizing Others, Negligent in Criticizing Themselves</p>
<p>The British know how to restrain themselves. For example, they also know that they should restrain excessive drinking. They also know that they should suppress anger in situations where they should be angry. They also know that they should be frugal in difficult times. However, they do not know how to reflect on everything. Someone once criticized Gladstone, saying that he never regretted anything. This does not refer to Gladstone alone. I am afraid that 99% of the three thousand million British people are like this. They are very sensitive to other people's bad deeds. For example, Gladstone criticized the Turkish king and called him a great executioner. The killing of Armenians by the Turks became a major issue in Britain. However, the killing of Indians, which was a hundred times more serious than this, was never mentioned. They think that everything they do is completely approved by God. They commit all sins in the name of God, such as robbery and murder, not only thinking that it is not wrong, but also regarding it as a matter of course. The British think that "the monarch cannot do wrong" is the first chapter of the constitution. Not only the monarch, but all British people cannot do wrong, which is almost an innate nature.</p>
<p>Sins Are Full and They Fall into Hell</p>
<p>In this way, they smuggle opium in China, or force opium, and when the Chinese government tries its best to ban it, they immediately use this as an excuse to start a war with China, demand compensation, cede land, and then end the matter. In short, they think that the British are relatives of God. This sense of superiority has made the British a great nation in the world. However, it is this sense of superiority that has dragged the great nation of the world, the British, into the depths of hell. No matter how great a nation is, once it forgets to reflect, it will immediately degenerate. We are not only seeing an example of Britain today, reading the rise and fall of great empires in ancient and modern history often produces this feeling.

<h3>Official Procedures Changed in the First and Eighth Districts, Stipulating That All Formal Documents Should Be Changed to Chinese</h3>
<p>The First and Eighth District Public Offices and the First and Third Police Bureaus of the city, which were bid farewell to last time, have been formally established, and the files, etc. of the former two concessions have also been received and sorted out. Therefore, all official documents, as well as public notices and orders, except for a few old cases that are still in English or Japanese, the rest of the new documents have been changed to Chinese, and a legal official document format has been adopted.</p>
<h3>After Buying Up Gauze, Retail Methods Are Planned, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Convened Talks</h3>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the national government's decision to buy up cotton yarn and cloth, Chen Chun-tuan, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, specifically entrusted the National General Chamber of Commerce to convene talks with yarn and cloth merchants in this city. Retail methods after the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth have been planned, and at the same time, the purchase policy, the establishment of the office, and the policies of the national government have been explained and elaborated in detail.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Purchasing Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>Since the National Government implemented the Provisional Regulations for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth and announced the implementation essentials, the entire nation's economic and industrial sectors have been encouraged. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited various financial and economic circles in the city to inquire about their thoughts on the National Government's implementation of the cotton yarn and cloth purchasing policy. The following was reported:</p>
<p>A prominent figure in the financial sector of this city expressed his thoughts, saying, "The National Government's implementation of cotton yarn purchases is a primary measure to eliminate national stockpiles and stabilize prices. Once the purchased cotton yarn and cloth are uniformly allocated, the people's livelihood will be stabilized, and economic recovery will be visible in the near future. In particular, the financial industry can correct past poor management, preventing the vast amount of idle capital in Shanghai from entering speculative ventures. Wealth can gradually be transferred to invest in industrial and commercial enterprises. As a result, the financial industry will enter a favorable environment. The financial industry is the mother of industry and commerce, and the rise and fall of industry and commerce is sufficient to affect the stability of the entire financial industry. For example, in the past, 80 to 90 percent of cotton yarn and cloth speculation and hoarding activities utilized bank and money shop liquidity. Now that cotton yarn and cloth purchases are implemented with balanced allocation, the government is putting industry and commerce on the right track and legalizing operations under the wartime system. Banks and money shops, without the instigation of speculators, will see the adverse effects on the financial industry clear up invisibly, which will greatly benefit the progress of the national economy during the wartime."</p>
<p>An economic expert, Mr. Li, commented on the National Government's purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, stating that it is a necessary measure to implement wartime economic strategies, regulate materials, and suppress prices. It can directly normalize the supply of materials to meet needs, reduce waste and consumption, eliminate private monopolies, seek personal gain, smooth the flow of materials, and prevent the recurrence of excessive stockpiling and shortages. Indirectly, it can view the demand for materials and promote increased production. Capitalists can focus on investing in production enterprises, and textile factories can increase the production of cotton yarn and cloth products due to the increased supply of raw materials, leading to rapid prosperity in business operations. Therefore, the general economic sector and various circles believe that it is not desirable to have large quantities of cotton yarn and cloth stockpiled, but rather to have a smooth flow of raw material production and transportation. A balanced production volume of cotton yarn and cloth products is essential for the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>A key member of the National Commercial Control Association stated the effects that can be achieved after the implementation of cotton yarn and cloth purchases: 1. Elimination of national stockpiles; 2. Eradication of speculative activities; 3. Reduction of market stimulation; 4. Stabilization of yarn and cloth market prices; 5. Gradual balance of supply and demand; 6. Promotion of textile production; 7. Restoration of normal economy; 8. Strengthening of wartime material resources, with clear guidelines for both military and civilian use.</p>
<h3>Storefront Display Competition Awards Given Yesterday</h3>
<p>The city propaganda office celebrating the return of concessions held a citywide store window competition. News of this was reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday (the 11th) at 3:00 PM, an awards ceremony was held in the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium. Dozens of representatives, including those from Wing On Company, Tianfu Nanhua Store, and Ren Chang Xiang Silk Shop, were present. The ceremony was presided over by Director Liang of the Municipal Propaganda Office. The ceremony was simple and grand. One super-grade award, two excellent-grade awards, thirty-six special awards, and twenty-nine first-grade awards were presented, with certificates, prizes, and cash awards given separately. All winning stores were notified in advance by the Propaganda Office. Those who won but did not attend the ceremony can collect their awards from the Municipal Propaganda Office between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM daily.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Salt Sales</h3>
<p>Recently, hoarders shifted their focus, and salt is in short supply, causing public anxiety. Because salt is the most important condiment, its shortage would greatly affect the health of citizens. It is understood that the salt authorities are not only strictly prohibiting illegal hoarding and price gouging and calling on all sectors to assist in reporting such activities, but also have resumed transporting large quantities of salt, which will be distributed to various sub-salt shops and wine shops. The official maximum price should not exceed $1.25 per market catty. The distribution method is recorded as follows: Those with sales quotas of 20 piculs or less will temporarily be allocated 1 picul each time; those with 21 to 50 piculs will be temporarily allocated 2 piculs; those with 51 piculs or more will be temporarily allocated 3 piculs. After the salt is sold, they can continue to receive allocations based on the salt sales records. This measure aims to prevent wholesale sales and does not mean that there is a shortage of salt production or inventory.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to China, Ambassador Tani, Left Shanghai Yesterday After Completing His Public Affairs, Having Provided Cooperation in the Purchase of Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>Since his arrival in Shanghai some days ago, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Ambassador Tani, has been extremely busy handling various official duties. On the 9th, he attended a symposium hosted by the Chairman and attended by Japanese military and civilian representatives. At the meeting, he responded to the National Government's mandatory purchase of cotton yarn and cloth and clearly stated his support for the government's policy and full cooperation. He also conducted important discussions with relevant authorities on the proper handling of Japanese residents' cotton yarn policies. He made significant contributions to various plans for building a new Shanghai after the takeover of the concessions. Having completed his mission, he departed for Nanjing by train at 9:20 AM on the 11th.</p>

<h3>Receiving Household Certificates: Personal Seal Required</h3>
<p>It is known that in the past, in the various Baojia districts under the jurisdiction of the First District of this city, residents applying for citizen certificates or other certificates, such as household transfer certificates, only needed the Bao Chief and Jia Chief to affix their seals. It is now learned that the relevant authorities, in view of the lack of prudence in such procedures, have specially stipulated that from now on, in addition to the seals of the Jia Chief and Bao Chief, the applicant and the head of household must also affix their seals when applying for citizen certificates and other important certificates. If the applicant does not have a seal, a fingerprint may be used instead.</p>
<h3>Theater Groups to Jointly Perform "The Family"</h3>
<p>In order to celebrate the recovery of the concessions and raise funds for the Drama Association, the drama groups of this city are scheduled to hold a joint performance of the famous play "The Family" at the Nanjing Grand Theater from the 9th to the 15th of this month. Preparations have been completed, and a preview will be held on the 8th to entertain viewers from all walks of life. The scene is grand and unprecedented. Ticket sales will begin on the 9th. Ticket prices for regular seats are divided into 20, 40, and 60 yuan. Honorary tickets are priced at 500 yuan. The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Government attaches great importance to this joint drama performance, as it is both an opportunity to expand publicity for the recovery of the concessions, inspire the public's emotions, and promote the unity of the drama community, so as to implement the cultural propaganda policy. In addition to providing support in the name of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Government, Minister Lin and Mayor Chen have jointly sent letters to influential figures from all walks of life inviting sponsorship. It is reported that many prominent figures from all walks of life are enthusiastically purchasing honorary tickets.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Cultural Shanghai Branch to Implement Reorganization</h3>
<p>Since Chu Minyi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, served as the chairman of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association's Nanjing headquarters, which was established in the 30th year of the Republic of China, the scale of the Shanghai branch has been deemed too small. In order to adapt to the new situation, the branch has decisively decided to implement a reorganization. In the past, the branch had been ordered by the Nanjing headquarters to implement the reorganization, and had repeatedly consulted with various parties concerned and conducted negotiations. Recently, the agreement has gradually matured, and a preparatory committee has been specially set up, with eight members taking office, in order to study the reorganization matters. The chairman of the preparatory committee is Chen Gongbo. The members are Okazaki Kaheita, Lin Jiong'an, Nakata Toyochiyo, Liang Xiuyu, Ueno Tachuu, Zhou Huarren, and Lin Anji. Although the branch will start again after being reorganized on its original foundation, the special feature of this reorganization is that it encompasses first-line cultural figures from the academic, educational, artistic, athletic, and social work fields, so that it can fully cope with the current historical turning point.</p>

<h3>Urgent Disaster Relief Basketball Tournament Closing Tonight: Zhongbei vs. Paramount, Women's Exhibition Game: Huatong vs. White Goose</h3>
<p>The urgent disaster relief charity basketball tournament, jointly organized by Paramount and Zhongbei Sports Association, has already seen Zhongbei and Paramount meet twice. Tonight marks the successful completion of the event. The organizers have invited Miss Xi Ling, the daughter of Vice President Qian of the Central Reserve Bank, to present the awards. The championship silver cup and the runner-up silver shield were both donated by Mr. Qian. Each participating exhibition team will also receive a commemorative flag. The pre-game program tonight will feature a women's basketball exhibition game between Huatong and White Goose, with Miss Chen Lu, a popular actress, throwing the opening ball. The game will still be held at 7:00 PM at Zhongqing. Regarding admission tickets, only dark red tickets are valid tonight; light green and light red tickets are no longer valid. Tickets from the first two games are also invalid. In the highly anticipated final battle, Paramount has already suffered two defeats. In this final showdown, they will certainly strive for victory to restore their reputation. Therefore, to increase their strength, they have recalled the famous players Bao Songyuan and Li Zude to return to the team. Although tonight's game is no longer related to rankings, their determination and fighting spirit will surely move heaven and earth.</p>

<h3>Economic Commentary: The Toxins of Shanghai's Economy</h3>
<p>The suffering of the people's economic lives in Shanghai is all caused by the toxins of Shanghai's economy. The previous article, "Preventive Ideological Disinfection," believed that if Shanghai's economy was not deeply poisoned, it would have to undergo a thorough disinfection movement.</p>
<p>The government's purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has led to skyrocketing prices, which is "Toxin Number One." However, the toxins of Shanghai's economy are not limited to one kind. Is hoarding and speculation not a toxin of Shanghai's economy? Is opium and gambling not a toxin?</p>
<p>Since the recovery of the concessions, the local Party Headquarters and other organizations have telegraphed requests to eradicate opium and gambling. This newspaper commented on it even earlier. In yesterday's telegram to the Chairman of the National Government and the Mayor of Shanghai from the Anhui Natives Association in Shanghai, it was said: "The concessions have been harboring dirt and filth for many years, which has long been criticized by the world, especially the transfer of opium, gambling, and dance halls, which are extremely vicious, exploiting and plundering... directly and indirectly causing skyrocketing prices... If it is not strictly prohibited, not only will prices not be suppressed, but the corruption will also be endless."</p>
<p>Indeed, hoarding and opium/gambling are both toxins of today's economy. Eradicating hoarding and opium/gambling must use the same antidote to achieve a healthy Shanghai economy!</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Entrusted to Collect Initial Reserve Guarantee and Responsible for Inspecting Savings Business</h3>
<p>The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has been ordered to be responsible for inspecting the business of savings banks and collecting a guarantee reserve equal to one-quarter of the total savings deposits. It has already sent letters to the branches ordering the savings banks to comply. The measures for paying the guarantee reserve for savings deposits are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The Ministry of Finance, for the purpose of implementing the provisions of Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law, entrusts the Central Reserve Bank to collect the savings deposit guarantee reserve and is responsible for its inspection and custody.</p>
<p>Article 2: The savings deposit guarantee reserve shall be at least one-quarter of the total savings deposits in the form of government bonds, treasury bills, and other truly reliable assets. The total amount of deposits stipulated in the preceding paragraph shall be based on the total balance at the end of each half-year.</p>
<p>Article 3: The Central Reserve Bank may, when necessary, hire experts to assess the value of various collateral items in the guarantee reserve.</p>
<p>Article 4: In addition to paying the guarantee reserve, the Ministry of Finance may at any time entrust the Central Reserve Bank to inspect the business content and the reality of all its assets.</p>
<p>Article 5: The savings bank may apply for the exchange of collateral of the same value at the end of each month. If the value of the collateral fluctuates too much, the Central Reserve Bank may order the savings bank to make up the difference or refund the excess.</p>
<p>Article 6: The Central Reserve Bank shall report the guarantee reserve deposited by the savings banks to the Ministry of Finance for record at the end of each month.</p>
<p>Article 7: These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions: Markets Unanimously Continue Weakness Yesterday, Yarn and Cloth Trading Disappears</h3>
<p>Since the Supreme National Defense Conference of the National Government passed the implementation of the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, other materials will also have similar measures. General speculators and hoarders have been greatly hit. Holders of inventory are in great panic. From yesterday, the general prices of various industries and markets have fallen sharply. The black market trading of cotton yarn and cloth has virtually stopped. Owners find it difficult to lower prices to pay taxes, but still no one cares. Red treasury bonds and stocks have seen a shocking drop. Yesterday, the market price of cotton yarn and cloth disappeared. The red envelopes still hovered around 90 yuan. Public prices continued to fall, and stock market prices were difficult to recover. Transactions were scarce. General black market brokers were all anxious. This is also the speculators reaping what they sowed.</p>
<h3>Businesses Violate Regulations by Selling Goods: All Sectors Request Dispatch of Personnel for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>More than 100 major and secondary trade associations in this city have recently received reports from various parties that the retail prices of goods from member stores of the associations have increased compared to a few days ago. At the same time, the prices on the labels are often ambiguous, and the goods displayed in the windows cannot be purchased as shown. In this way, the initial efforts of the authorities and the trade associations to stabilize the market and suppress prices will be in vain. All sectors have appealed to dispatch personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth. It is now learned that all trade associations, in order to uphold their original intentions and to reassure the public, have already successively dispatched staff members to investigate the sales situation of member stores of the associations. The main points of the investigation are nothing more than:</p>
<p>* Whether the prices marked for various retail goods comply with the price limits assessed by the association.</p>
<p>* Whether they refuse to sell any goods.</p>
<p>* Whether they sell large quantities of goods to grain dealers at high prices.</p>
<p>* Whether they issue invoices as requested when selling goods.</p>
<p>* Whether the units of measurement used meet the standards.</p>
<p>* Whether any goods sold are not recorded in the accounts.</p>
<p>Any responsible investigator who discovers any of the above violations must submit a written report of the facts to the trade association, and then the association will discuss and punish them according to the severity of the situation, or report them to the authorities for handling according to law. However, it is learned that all investigators dispatched by the trade associations have formal credentials. Any company or business that encounters such situations can ask them to show their credentials to avoid being deceived.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the decline of Chinese stocks expanded, showing a tendency to collapse. Driven by the environment, the number of sellers increased. Although investment absorption was used to maintain the situation, it was powerless. Although it tried to reverse the declining trend, all stocks were still 20% to 40% lower than the high peak on August 2. Yesterday, the textile industry still suffered the most severe decline. Wing On Textiles broke 1,500 yuan again, falling by nearly 150 yuan. Sino-Russian retreated to around 70 yuan. Lunhua was difficult to sell at half price. Hongshen and Great China Weaving, as well as Guoxin, Tianlun, Zhenfeng and other stocks, were all exhausted. In the department store industry, Wing On Company retreated below 55 yuan. Sincere and National Goods both broke the 30 yuan mark and were still falling. Sincere Department Store was also below 50 yuan. Innerwear opened below 100 yuan, falling by nearly 10 yuan again. Jingfu Socks traded within the 40 yuan range. The supply of woolen fabrics at 150 yuan was less than the demand. The cultural industry declined the least. Commercial Press, Zhonghua, and World Bookstore each fell by more than 10 yuan. Yongxiang Printing showed a weak trend. Nanyang Tobacco Company fell sharply by nearly 100 yuan. Great China Matches also fell by half price. In the public utility industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity also broke the 30 yuan mark, while Huashang Electric fell by a small amount. Public Utility Motor was the only one that remained stable. Xin Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, a new pharmaceutical company, also fell to the edge of 90 yuan. Sino-French traded ex-rights, opening at around 60 yuan. Wuzhou, Sino-Western, and Xinyi were all flat. Standard Paper Products and Pufeng Paper were only slightly lower. Jiu'an and Great China Industrial were also declining slightly. The former still had low-priced buyers, while investors in Xinghua Industrial had disappeared. New Yi Real Estate was approaching 40 yuan. Shanghai Third Transportation and She Shengqi were still stable. Kangyuan Biscuits fell close to the 20 yuan mark. Standard Powder and Jimmei Foods both showed weakness. Other stocks also showed a slight decline.</p>
<h3>Economic Office Investigates Warehouses and Prepares Proof Letters</h3>
<p>The Economic Office of the First District Public Office of this city continues to carry out the investigation of warehouses and storage yards of the former Public Concession Materials Control Bureau, but strictly manages the investigators. When carrying out their work, in addition to showing their identification cards, they must also provide a proof letter prepared by the office. If there are investigators from the office coming to the warehouses and storage yards to investigate materials, they must ask the investigators for a proof letter to prevent fraudulent activities.</p>

<h3>Free Talk: Success and Failure by Mei'an</h3>
<p>Who in the world does not yearn for success and abhor failure? However, how can one embark on the road to success without tasting the bitter juice of failure? There is a considerable price to pay; success is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>A successful person must encounter some obstacles and suffer some hardships beforehand, but he never gives up, does not lose heart, and, with a strong will and clear goal, strives to overcome the adversities he encounters. Over time, he can handle everything with ease, overcome all difficulties, sweep away all obstacles, and enjoy the joy of getting whatever he wants. The goddess of success will be smiling and beckoning to him.</p>
<p>Otherwise, troubles will arise one after another, obstacles will keep piling up. If you are unwilling to sacrifice and suffer, and you do not have the courage to fight against the harsh environment, how can you not be swallowed by the god of failure, trapped in a circle of distress, and spin around and around without any chance of breaking free?</p>
<p>However, nothing in the world can be generalized. Many things that seem to be successful on the surface are actually failures, and many things that seem to be failures on the surface are actually successes.</p>
<h3>Short Dress and Vegetarian Diet by Zuoqun</h3>
<p>The hardships of life are an undeniable reality, and to live on is also a necessary path. But to "live and work in peace" in this "autumn of adversity" is no longer possible, so we can only seek a secondary option.</p>
<p>If life cannot be superior, seek a secondary option: in terms of residence, one can live comfortably in a small room; in terms of travel, one can take public transportation. Only clothing and food are costly and difficult to save on because a family, with old and young, must have clothes to cover their bodies and food to avoid hunger. One cannot be thin here and thick there.</p>
<p>From the above practical situation, I believe that empty talk about thrift and asking people to suffer is not as effective as devising a reasonable solution for clothing and food based on the circumstances. I say that the best method is short dress and a vegetarian diet.</p>
<p>The short dress method is:</p>
<p>* Short hair.</p>
<p>* Short coat (Hong Kong style shirt).</p>
<p>* Short pants (Western style).</p>
<p>* Short socks (young people can skip socks).</p>
<p>* Short-barrelled shoes (rubber running shoes).</p>
<p>If a man has the above five kinds of attire, compared to the Chinese style long robe and short jacket, it is lighter, cheaper, and more generous. The total price is not even as much as a medium-quality silk long gown. Moreover, it is very convenient to wash and wear. Why not do it?</p>
<p>The vegetarian diet method is: two vegetables and one soup every day (all cooked with vegetables). This can provide enough food for a small family of four or five people. If there are more people, the amount can be increased according to the situation. As for the dishes themselves, such as chicken feathers, amaranth, stir-fried cucumber, stir-fried red beans, stir-fried soybean sprouts, stir-fried eggplant, dried tofu, fried edamame, fried tofu, vegetable stewed potatoes, stewed soybeans, eggplant potato soup, pickled cabbage and bean curd soup, etc., you can automatically vary the dishes with vegetables. The above dishes are very rich in vitamins and nutrition, and they are also very delicious.</p>
<h3>Gods and Ghosts by Jianqun</h3>
<p>The people who are least afraid of ghosts in the world are those who can pray to ghosts for others and who can communicate with ghosts. It is not because the ghosts are afraid of them, or because the ghosts are their friends. Only they know best that there are no ghosts in this world.</p>
<p>The people who are least respectful of gods in the world are those who can pray to gods for others and who can communicate with gods. It is not because the gods love them, or because the gods are their friends. Only they know best that there are no gods in this world.</p>
<p>Gods and ghosts are a means used by rulers in ancient times to achieve two goals: first, to make the people fear and obey, and second, to make the officials fear and submit.</p>
<p>However, if politics is not on track, society is not improved, and people's livelihoods are not taken care of, no matter how terrifying you make the ghosts or how omnipotent you make the gods, it will be useless.</p>
<h3>Evening Stroll in the Park: Five-Character律詩 by Wang Shixiong</h3>
<p>The roosting birds hurry home,</p>
<p>I ascend the grass pavilion in the east.</p>
<p>Fragrant forest, maple fruit, silk floss,</p>
<p>Green shadows, silver lamps, red ripples.</p>
<p>A bay of water reflects light,</p>
<p>The dark night shrouds.</p>
<p>Sparse stars invite the bright moon,</p>
<p>We sit in a row and discuss heroes.</p>
<h3>(Assisting School through Subsidies) National Forum: The Current Stage of Family System in China by Ling Dading</h3>
<p>China's family system has been affected by this war. At the beginning of the war, the masses fled in droves. People with fixed assets in the family mostly had the old, weak, and women leave first, leaving the young and strong to temporarily support them. But many compatriots could only let the old and weak die in ditches, and the strong scattered in all directions. Among a family, the young and strong are mostly the productive force, the backbone of the family, and the hub that maintains family affection. A family that has fled and lost the young and strong lacks vitality and loses the connection of family affection. For example, disputes between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law and estrangement between grandparents and grandchildren are inevitable facts, which can cause family division. At the same time, if the number of family members is too large, in the rush to escape, the supply of food, travel, and accommodation are difficult to take care of, and it will inevitably lead to the disintegration of large families into small families, each coping with the current situation. Therefore, it can be said that escape and exile have destroyed the original form of the family system.</p>
<p>After the war, the refugees slowly returned. In the past two or three years, due to the rise in grain prices, the income of farmers has gradually become abundant. At the same time, since the outbreak of the war, people in the cities have run to the countryside, and people in the countryside have also run to the cities. With the exchange of people between rural and urban areas, the pure atmosphere of the countryside has been infected by the extravagance of the cities. Opium and gambling have spread throughout the countryside. Now, gambling with thousands of yuan as a unit is everywhere in the countryside, and the prevalence of opium is even more alarming. Because the harm of opium and gambling is very simple, even a family is difficult to maintain, and the impact involves the future of China's family, which is unbearable to imagine.</p>
<p>In the recent two or three years, because of the strict control of materials, merchants can profit by transporting goods. In order to supplement household expenses, women and children have also flocked to transport rice to the cities, and then bring some commodities such as cigarettes, matches, and soap to the countryside. The monthly profit is also one or two thousand yuan. This has the following three effects: First, women are not often at home, and household affairs will inevitably become a mess. Second, women feel that it is easy to make money, and because they often go to the cities, they inevitably become accustomed to extravagance. At the same time, daily contact with outsiders may also cause indecent behavior. Third, women think that they can make money and be self-reliant. They despise their father and husband for their years of hard work, and their income is difficult to make ends meet, which will lead to a psychology of contempt. Once this psychology occurs, there will never be peace in the family, and the original family organization and affection will be completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Cultivating the next generation of citizens, family education is more important than school education. The current school education, generally speaking, is much lower than the pre-war level, and the family situation, as mentioned in the above sections, who has the energy to educate their children? May I ask, what good citizens can be educated from a family that is indulging in opium and gambling or is busy running around for food and clothing without anyone to care for and educate them? Without good citizens, how can good families be organized? Therefore, it can be said that war not only destroys the current family system but also destroys the possibility of a healthy family re-establishment. At this moment, we must rebuild a sound family system.</p>

<h3>Record of a Visit to the Salesian House of Studies (3)</h3>
<p>During the time of Don Bosco, his work had already spread from Italy to France, England, and the Americas, including Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. After the saint's passing, his followers not only continued his work but also strived to expand it. Over the past sixty years, it has spread across five continents and over fifty countries. According to Father Ooms, there are currently one Cardinal, nine Archbishops, and sixteen Bishops in the order. The Salesian Society (comprising priests, brothers, assistant brothers, and instructors of agricultural, industrial, and commercial skills) has approximately 12,000 members. There are over 400 oratories worldwide, about 130 industrial schools, 60 agricultural schools, around 200 primary, secondary, and vocational schools, over 150 night schools, more than 50 boarding houses for high school and university students, roughly 100 schools for cultivating talent to manage the Society, eight hospitals, and over 400 summer camps. There are a total of seventeen missionary districts and thirty-two auxiliary missionary districts. The work of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians is not included in these figures.</p>
<p>The Salesian Society's Work in China</p>
<p>The international headquarters of the Salesian Society of Don Bosco is located in Turin, Italy. In China, the general branch offices are located in Macau and Shanghai. The former serves as the center for the Society's work in the two regions of Hong Kong, Qujiang, and Kunming, while the latter serves as the center for the work in Shanghai, Xuzhou, and other areas. The current head of the Salesian Society in China is Father Charles Brasa. His account of the Salesian Society's development in China is quite captivating.</p>
<p>The Salesian Society recognized the importance of coming to China to educate and care for poor Chinese children very early on. In the thirty-second year of Guangxu (1906), Bishop Don Bosco first came to Macau to establish the "Immaculate Conception Industrial School." In 1918 (Year 7 of the Republic), the Salesian Society began managing the Shaoguan (Qujiang) Diocese. In 1925 (Year 14 of the Republic), at the invitation of Mr. Lu Bohong, they first arrived in Shanghai. In 1927 (Year 16 of the Republic), at the invitation of the Catholic Church in Hong Kong, they took over the St. Louis School in Sai Ying Pun, Hong Kong. In subsequent years, with the assistance of Hong Kong gentlemen such as Sir Ho Tung and Mr. Fung Ping Shan, they built the "Children's Industrial Institute" in Aberdeen, Hong Kong, which is renowned throughout the Orient. This institute is large in scale, produces talented individuals, and is truly one of the best vocational schools in China. In 1935 (Year 24 of the Republic), the Salesian Society's Shangzhi School was established in the provincial capital of Yunnan (Kunming). Currently, there are over 300 Salesians in China, including more than 50 Chinese members. The main endeavors they are involved in are as follows:</p>
<p>Macau: There is the "Immaculate Conception School," which is divided into (1) Academic: primary and advanced elementary school, and junior high school, with a total of over 100 students. (2) Industrial: leather making, tailoring, carpentry, typesetting, printing, and bookbinding, with approximately 100 residential students. (3) Portuguese and Chinese orphanages, etc.</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The first school established was the St. Louis School in Sai Ying Pun, which is divided into (1) Academic: primary and junior high school, with over 500 students. (2) Industrial: typesetting, printing, and bookbinding, with about 100 students. (3) Orphanage. The second is the Children's Industrial Institute in Aberdeen, divided into (1) Academic: primary and advanced elementary school, with over 200 students. (2) Industrial: [number missing] students. There is also the Sacred Heart Seminary in Hong Kong's Pok Fu Lam, which includes a seminary, a philosophy institute, a novitiate, and an aspirants' house.</p>
<p>Shaoguan Diocese: There is the Shaoguan Dongshan High School, junior high school, and attached leather shoe making, tailoring, typesetting, printing, and bookbinding departments, with a total of approximately 400 students. The Lijun Primary and Junior High Girls' School is managed by the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians. The diocese's seminaries and schools are also managed by the Society.</p>
<p>Yunnan: The Shangzhi School is located in Kunming City. The academic side includes a junior high school with over 200 students, and the industrial side includes carpentry, leather shoe making, typesetting, printing, and bookbinding departments.</p>
<p>Shanghai: The main endeavors of the Salesian Society of Don Bosco are: (1) Yangshupu Bosco School, (2) Nanshi Yixin Middle School, (3) Nanxiang Agricultural Development School, and (4) Jiangwan Agricultural College.</p>
<p>The Salesian Society of Don Bosco's work in China began at the beginning of the 20th century. After a third of a century of efforts, it has made considerable contributions to the education and care of impoverished and out-of-school youth in our country. In order to advance the nation's culture and construction, it cannot help but inspire admiration, and it is necessary to have a deeper understanding of it.</p>
<p>The Base Camp of the Industrial Reserve Army</p>
<p>In the southeast of Yangshupu, Shanghai's largest industrial district, amidst the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the Water Company, and other well-known heavy, light, pharmaceutical, and chemical industry factories, stands a magnificent four-story building. This is the training ground for the industrial construction reserve army – Bosco School. Although surrounded by artificial factories, the school is located on a vast wilderness. The winding Hangzhou Road, vegetable fields, barren land, shacks, and wild shops are full of rustic charm, making it an excellent place for studying.</p>
<p>Bosco School was founded in 1925 (Year 14 of the Republic) at the invitation of Mr. Lu Bohong by the Salesian Society in Shanghai. It was first established in Nanshi. In 1927 (Year 16 of the Republic), when the Northern Expeditionary Army entered Shanghai, it was relocated to Yangshupu and rented a school building. The scale was small. It was not until 1933 (Year 22 of the Republic) that the school building was built. It was only through the hard work and painstaking efforts of the priests and brothers that it reached its current scale. The school is now divided into two parts: "Bosco Primary and Secondary School," which focuses on science. The curriculum and teaching content are the same as ordinary schools. "Bosco Vocational School" focuses on vocational education and practice. There are three years of lower level and two years of advanced level. In 1934 (Year 23 of the Republic), a woodworking workshop was first established, manufacturing pianos, etc., and the products were well received by society. In 1935 (Year 24 of the Republic), a printing factory was added, and the business became even more developed. In 1936 (Year 25 of the Republic), an electrical workshop was added. Now there are electrical, mechanical, woodworking, typesetting, printing, and [missing text] departments, and a music band organization, making it a complete industrial college.</p>
<p>Since the July 7th Incident, Bosco School has graduated three [missing number], cultivating 150 specialized talents. Some have gone on to study at Fu Jen Catholic University, and some are employed in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles. The majority are introduced by the school to various factories. One graduate is now an engineer at the Suzhou Electric Power Plant. There is also a nineteen-year-old boy who works at the Yangshupu Power Plant and earns as much as 300 military yuan per month. He even voluntarily donates half of his monthly salary to the school. This shows the success of the school's training. As a result, the number of students increased greatly last semester, with 80 boarders and 400 day students. The next semester is scheduled to begin on September 1st, and the enrollment quota has been increased to 600.</p>
<p>The visit took place during the semester. The boarders were catching up on their academic subjects. Although there were not many people in each workshop, it was full of energy. Except for the woodworking and printing departments, which are now only used for practice due to the impact of social conditions and have not realized their productivity, the electrical and mechanical departments are very active. Teachers and students are working hard early in the morning. The factories have been overwhelmed with orders. The main products are motors, iron keys, fans, irons, machine tools, and various parts. An Italian musician is providing individual instruction to the music band. The impoverished students are especially diligent. They are also happy to share international famous songs with visitors.</p>
<p>The principal of Bosco School is Father Miguel, a passionate and capable Italian who has a considerable command of Chinese. There are seventeen teachers, twelve of whom are Chinese brothers, and the rest are Italian and German. There is one Irish person. There are four staff members, all of whom are [Chinese] priests. According to Father Ooms, the current work only represents one-fifth of the ideal. He hopes that the remaining four-fifths will be completed in the shortest possible time with the help of all sectors of society. They hope to build more school buildings and increase the number of students. Each semester, they want to increase the number of boarding students in general academic subjects by 300, the number of elementary industrial students by 300, and the number of day students in elementary and advanced industrial subjects by 1,000. As for the workshops, in addition to electrical, mechanical, civil engineering, and printing, they want to add tailoring, textile, and leather departments. They hope to train more construction cadres for New China.</p>
<p>The Red House—A Greenhouse for New Cadres</p>
<p>On Guohuo Road in Nanshi, a quiet street, the most striking thing is the towering "Red House," as majestic and awe-inspiring as the Dacheng Hall in Qufu. This is another endeavor run by the Salesian Society of Don Bosco – Yixin Primary and Secondary School. This school was originally the "St. Joseph Vocational School" founded by Mr. Lu Bohong in 1925 (Year 14 of the Republic). The purpose of running the school at that time was to help poor children in Shanghai, teach them skills to make a living, and make them productive members of society. The head priest and teachers were all members of the Society, and the hundreds of students were sent by various charities and philanthropists in the city. During the Shanghai War, due to its location, it was bombarded. The three-story building on the right side still has a [missing text] from top to bottom, which was completely destroyed and has not yet been repaired. The situation after the disaster is unbearable to describe.</p>
<p>Starting in 1940 (Year 29 of the Republic), the members of the Society, seeing that the situation had stabilized somewhat, continued to operate on the original site. The current Yixin School was born in ruins and hardship. It has accepted more than 300 poor children from Nanshi. The principal is Father Shuai Yihua, an Italian, a warm-hearted and upright religious figure who is determined to serve the cause of education and care for suffering children in China. He has extraordinary enthusiasm and ability. In the autumn of 1941 (Year 30), he received 50 bags of American flour from Father Wan of the Society of Jesus, and he began to take in boarding students, increasing from 30 to over 100 now, many of whom were sent by philanthropists such as Mr. Wen Guanting.</p>
<p>Yixin School currently has six classrooms for primary school and three classrooms for junior high school. The textbooks are the same as ordinary primary and secondary schools. Before the summer vacation, some boarding students were catching up on their subjects. In a junior high school classroom, the voice of the lecturer could be heard clearly. Upon entering, it turned out that there was only one student, and the lecturer was teaching as earnestly as if he were facing dozens or hundreds of people. It's so touching! After class, teachers and students strolled and chatted in the square, as intimate as fathers and sons, brothers. Opposite the school, there is another row of Western-style houses, which was formerly the Zhengxiu School founded by Mr. Lu Bohong. It has now been converted into another middle school department of Yixin School, which specializes in enrolling teenagers. The Salesian Society of Don Bosco has a "Postulancy," which enables young people who aspire to follow Saint Bosco to acquire the knowledge and skills to preach and educate suffering children. There are currently about 40 students from all over the country, all of whom have great enthusiasm and faith. The building on the left side of the school is now the place where the Society's brothers and monks who came to Shanghai from Hong Kong study. They are all religious warriors who are cultivating new cadres. It is said that there are over 300 people there.</p>
<p>Principal Shuai said that in order to inherit Mr. Lu Bohong's legacy, Yixin School, in addition to ordinary primary and secondary schools, (the enrollment quota for the next semester is 150 boarders and 350 day students,) is also doing its best to prepare for the establishment of an industrial department to cultivate specialized talents. He took reporters to a small room, which is the [missing text] workshop for shoemaking, tailoring, and carpentry. It is currently planned to enroll 20 students. With his efforts, if he can get more social assistance, it will soon develop into a large-scale vocational school. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Wu Song Talks About the First District Government's Special Committee Missions Remaining the Same</h3>
<p>Wu Song, the Chief Secretary of the First District Public Office, stated to reporters yesterday that "the authorities will make efforts in all aspects to seek a solution to the economic problems of this port, and will make every effort to maintain the foundations and efficiency established by the former Public Concession Bureau in the previous two years for fixing prices."</p>
<p>Three Basic Points for Implementing New Policies</p>
<p>It is understood that Mr. Wu himself has been engaged in diplomatic affairs for many years in the past. This is his first time taking office as a civil servant. According to Mr. Wu, the complexities and difficulties that exist today existed before the return of the Concession. Therefore, in order to cope with this fact, the policies implemented must be based on the following three points: To do its best to solve various important problems. These problems include the material control principles set by the Nanjing government and the municipal standing bureau, and conduct negotiations with the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Government Itself</p>
<p>Enhance the effectiveness of the government itself, and cooperate with the Eighth District Public Office and the Special Municipal Government authorities to re-establish various plans. The third point is to maintain the various foundations and efficiencies established by the old municipal authorities for fixing prices over the past three years.</p>
<p>The Functions of Special Committees Remain the Same</p>
<p>When asked about the various special committees established by the former Public Concession Bureau, Mr. Wu replied that after discussion and decision, they will continue to perform their duties as usual. It is said that there are a total of investigative committees, port air defense committees, timber committees, health committees, educational and youth associations, industrial and social affairs committees, Baojia committees, tax committees, and material control committees.</p>
<h3>The Opening Date of All Iron Gates Scheduled to Start on the 15th</h3>
<p>The iron gates connecting the old French Concession to Nanshi will be opened to the public since the National Government has implemented the recovery of the Concession. All closed iron gates should be opened generally. It is reported that the authorities have scheduled to implement this starting on the fifteenth day of the lunar month. The Second and Third Police Bureaus of the city are now preparing for police security after the opening of each iron gate to ensure safety and promote the prosperity of Nanshi.</p>
<p>Accepting Documents</p>
<p>Since the judicial institutions of the city were unified and reorganized, the former Nanshi District Court, the Shanghai First and Second Special District Courts, and the Second and Third Branch Courts of the Jiangsu High Court have all been abolished and merged into one Shanghai High Court and Shanghai District Court. This reorganization work has been completed. Therefore, the documents of the former Special First Court and the Second Branch Court of the High Court have been received by the High Court and the District Court respectively. The documents of the Second Branch Court of the High Court were also handed over to the High Court a few days ago. As for the documents of the Special Second Court and the Nanshi District Court, due to procedural reasons, they have not yet been transferred to the District Court for acceptance. It is expected that this can be done in two or three days.</p>
<h3>Increasing the Salaries of Teachers and Staff Starting in August; Proposing to Increase the Stamp Tax Assistance Fee to 900,000 Yuan to Assist Private Schools</h3>
<p>Now that the two concessions have been taken over, the educational administration has also been unified. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mayor Chen yesterday to inquire about the educational situation in the city. Mayor Chen said that no matter how good the educational policy is, we should first consider the difficult lives of teachers and staff. (The salaries of teachers and staff of municipal schools in the city have been scheduled to be increased in August. As for private schools, it is also planned to allocate 500,000 yuan per month as a general subsidy.</p>
<p>Subsidizing Private Schools</p>
<p>When asked about the source of this subsidy, Mayor Chen said that the Ministry of Finance had previously implemented a tobacco and alcohol stamp tax in the concessions, and there was an assistance fee for promoting it in the two concessions. Now that the concessions have been taken over, the local government has the responsibility to promote the central tax. Therefore, it is planned to ask the Ministry of Finance to increase this subsidy fee to 500,000 yuan and transfer it to subsidize the salaries of teachers and staff in private schools. This undertaking has been approved by Minister Zhou Fo and Director Shao Shijun, and it will be implemented this month. As for the past Education Association, which was headed by me as the chairman, it is also planned to reorganize it into a true educational community, so that the government and the people can cooperate to promote education. The aforementioned subsidy for private schools is also planned to be managed and distributed by the reorganized Education [missing word].</p>
<p>Lin Jiongan Talks</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Lin Jiongan, the Director of the Education Bureau of the First District, yesterday (the 11th) to inquire about the unified situation of educational administration in the city. He was told that all primary and secondary schools established by the former Public Works Bureau of the French Concession and the Public Concession Bureau have been uniformly changed to municipal schools, so as to sweep away the past畸形 state and complete a sound organization. It can be expected that the education of the Greater Shanghai will be promoted from now on. Finally, the reporter asked about the educational situation in the district because Director Lin also served as the Director of the Education Department of the First District Public Office. He learned that there are currently more than 130 qualified primary and secondary schools in the district, and the former Public Concession Bureau subsidized 2 million yuan for education expenses each year. There are five middle schools, seven primary schools, five compulsory night schools, and one compulsory half-day primary school established by the bureau. The primary and secondary schools have been renamed municipal schools, and the night schools and half-day primary schools have been renamed municipal community schools. All schools in the district have been promoting education in accordance with the plan.</p>
<h3>The Third Police Bureau Holds a Bureau Affairs Meeting to Discuss the Main Points of Public Security</h3>
<p>Su Chengde, the Deputy Director of the Third Police Bureau of this city, in order to effectively maintain local public security, convened a bureau affairs meeting in the bureau's conference room at 5:00 PM yesterday (the evening of the 11th), with the chiefs of the various branches. The points that should be paid attention to in maintaining Shanghai's public security in the future were discussed in detail, and decisions have been made. From now on, we will follow the established policies and strive to strengthen police affairs.</p>
<h3>Unconvicted Criminals Transferred to the Detention Center of the Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>During the period when the former First Special District Court existed, the criminals arrested by the police of the Public Works Bureau were detained in the police station before the verdict. Only after the verdict were they sent to the Tilanqiao Prison for execution. Now that the judicial and police institutions have been reorganized due to the takeover of the concessions, the criminals arrested by the police bureau are investigated by the police bureau, and a report is made and sent to the local procuratorate for investigation. After the interrogation is completed, they are no longer taken back to the police station for detention, but are directly sent by the local procuratorate to the detention center on Massenet Road under its jurisdiction for temporary detention. This measure has been officially implemented a few days ago.</p>
<h3>The 20th Batch of Rice in Western Shanghai Will Be Delivered Tomorrow</h3>

It is also learned that a total of 55 rice businesses in the Fourth District of Shanghai have submitted a request to the District Public Office to organize a special self-defense group, with each business sending four people to be members of the special self-defense group.</p>
