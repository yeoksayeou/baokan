<p>社評</p>
<h3>壯志凌雲　對於空的紀念日應有的認識</h3>
<p>今天友邦日本，熱烈慶祝空的紀念日，陸軍當局，並於前日發表日空軍新銳機三架之命名，以公佈於列强之前。在我國國民，對於天空知識，似乎太缺乏了；雖然我國的天文學的硏究極早，而一般農民也對氣候天象等都能由於日常經騐而獲得一些知識，但是未必適合時代的需要，未必符合科學的條件，因此一般的說，我們對於天空的知識是非常膚淺的。然而，從當前的時勢需要而言，從科學與文明的發展趨勢而言，不僅要重視大陸與海洋上平面的點綫的發展，而且要重視天空與陸海綜合的立體的發展，那一國在這一方面的硏究和敎育落後了，那麼它就不免於落伍，不能與列强躊立於未來新世界。我們怎能不以「壯志凌雲」的勇氣，迎頭趕上。</p>
<p>從目前戰爭而言，是一種立體性的戰爭，特別是常此二次大戰決戰階段，空中戰的威力，是國民總力戰中最主要的因素，誰能確保制空權，誰就可以保持其制海權和協助其陸上部隊的推進，所以無論攻防兩方面，爭奪控制權，已成爲今日大戰中取勝的要點，甚至說制空權對此次戰爭具有決定的力量，亦不爲過。我們是參戰國之一，我們國民，無論消極的爲保障自已的身家性命財產，或是積極的協助友邦日本協力爭取大東亞的戰勝，都必須竭其全力於對空的防衛。因此；一方面要推進防空運動，使每一個人民都明瞭防空的意義和方法，空襲期間協力維持社會秩序的責任。另一方面更須協助政府建設空軍，有錢者輸財，少壯者投身於空軍，使我廣闊的領空，得以保衛。</p>
<p>進一步說，將來戰後新秩序的建設，新國家的建設，舉凡文化的復興，工商貿易各業的發展，農村經濟的促進，都與航空運輸，無綫電及其他空中知識與事業有密切關係，都當於今日預爲必要的準備。所以我們更望自今日起，在最短期間，對於有關天空的科學知識，從天文，氣象，電學，無綫電，航空機械，空中交通，通信，運輸的學識，技術與事業，實現下列諸點：　政府常局以中央研究院爲中心，在科學先進的日德等友邦的協助之下，展開關於天空知識的硏究運動，逐漸普及至民間。　强化各級學校的科學敎育，特別對於大學及專門學校，以造成大量此種科學幹部爲目標之一。　推進民衆科學敎育，一方面整理我國固有天象氣候占風占雨等舊知識，一方面介紹日德各國關於天空的新學識，利用到農業及一般生產上去。　特別提倡航空，滑翔，跳傘等遝動，增進國人對於空中的知識，促進空中運輸及培養空軍人材。爲了中國，爲了東亞的安全與共榮，我們必須努力這種事業，這是我們在空的紀念日更須認識的幾點。</p>
<h3>勵義民衆奮起　助盟邦完成勝利　墨索里尼向全國廣播演說</h3>
<p>馬十九日中央社電海通社訉，墨索里尼昨夜向義大利人民發表廣播演說：黑衫同志　男女同胞平，經長時期之沉默後，儲君又再度聆悉余之語音矣，諸君尙能認識之，此即嘗與諸君共患雜享安樂之語音也。余以精神需要休息。故直至今日始重與世界人士相見，無綫電中未便作長談，同時余亦不願詳談過去時局，僅自七月二十五日以後發生之事始，余一生之冒險生活中，尙有幾難便人相信之冒險事件在焉，余與義王之談話，尙不足二十分鐘，渠　巳決，故諒解巳無希望，危機巳有爆發之勢。</p>
<p>個人悲劇告一段落</p>
<p>戰時或平時雖不乏大臣去職將領槍決之事，然忠誠事王逾二十年若余者，竟在宮廷　　被捕，强迫曳登救護車，誠為前所未聞。當時雖謂救余至安全之處，然余已知其所謂保護，實非安全之謂，當余自羅馬被移往彭薩，此項猜測之可能性益增强，迨自彭薩移至馬特萊那島，再自該島移至格朗蔭索山中，余巳能確定彼等已決定將余引渡敵方矣。余雖與外界完全隔絕，然確信希特勒元首必能以較袍澤之情更深切之手足之情思念及余。常余獲悉停戰協定後，其第十二條之意何指，余巳不復　　，彼高級官員固曾告余將以余爲質也。九月十二前夜，余已通知余之家屬，決不令敵人將余生擒，當時山間情緖緊張已極，至下午二時，余即見傘兵自天空下降，余之看守深切了無事態之嚴重，竟未開槍，此均五分鐘內之事也，由此亦可見德軍組織之嚴密與夫將士之用命矣，此等事　誠足傳之後世。而余個人之悲劇亦於焉告一段落</p>
<p>負起責任收拾殘局然民主國家陷害義大利之可怖悲劇，固正方興未艾也。七月廿五日以後政府所採取之措施，足見其已有結束義大利廿年光榮歷史之意，義大利帝國之建立與夫國家之種種吾人今已不避艱險，負起各首犯之罪責加以硏究。首論義王，渠乃直接負責者。渠雖為宣戰者，然一切戰敗論調與夫及德宣傳，亦　以之爲中心，義王常故意採取與敵意相符之行動，僅偶以無意出之，而王儲雖名爲南阿梅里之司令，而從不一臨戰塲，余早知　伏亞王朝將與巴特里奥等懦怯將領及法四斯黨之腐敗份子，秘密策劃政變。不料在余被捕之先，蔭伏亞王朝即已秘密與英開始停戰談判，此誠背棄德國盟邦之無恥行爲，甚至於停戰協定簽字後，義王尙矢口否認有此等談判在進行中，此乃廿年前余所敎之於危險中之王朝，今竟以一八四八年之舊法令爲基礎，而設立新政府，給予人民以緊急狀態刀刃尖鋒之下之自　。</p>
<p>重建國家至於停戰協定，其條件之苛刻，當非想像所能及，義王旣不願及此等條件之內容，亦不顧及余之　交付敵方，渠所慮者乃彼之玉位，乃不惜　義大利於混亂恥辱痛苦之中其輕視之意，今後每一義人將永為他人不齒矣。此等可恥之行為，其結果必影響及於每一義人，吾人除失去榮譽外，並失去阿德里亞海愛奥尼安海。法國南部及巴爾幹半島之所有我軍隊，在二十四小時內即巳潰不成軍，在平民之笑聲中，彼等巳被我盟邦解除武裝，經二十年之努力而建立之義大利皇家海軍，竟投奔英帝國主義老之中心爲義大利腹心之患之馬爾太島。法西斯主義未曾背棄君主，而君王今已背棄法西斯主義矣，君王旣未能盡其歷史性之使命已失去存在之權利。重建之國家應使之完全國民化社會化。</p>
<p>鮮血洗刷歷史污點爲求吾人之運動能發揮力最起見，吾人首先要求我國民奮起，與德日盟邦聯肩作戰，吾人僅能以鮮血洗刷此歷史上之莫大污點，吾人當改部軍條，以法西斯民團為核心。不憑已力，決不能獲得勝利，一切　國叛逆尤其是於七月廿五日下午九時　分加入新政府後又投效敵方之人，將予澈底剷除。廢除財閥政治，以人民之工作建立眞正之社會國家。全國之黑衫同志　友人乎，余　向諸君請求一體武裝起來，敵人雖因吾人之投降而喜，然此非已得勝之謂，友邦德國及日本決定作戰到底，絕不與敵妥協，願黑衫同志重　部隊，靑年同志投效軍隊飛行員使敵人無從襲衆我城鎭。法西斯女同志再予我國民以精神上之援助，國家乃諸君之國家，願盡力保衛之不使再陷入危險，吾人憑吾人之勇氣忠心與志願，必可使義大利有新的將來，能在光明之中生存，吾人當使此希望成爲事實，義大利萬歲，新法西斯共和黨萬歲。</p>
<h3>日本國民獻機　今日命名典禮</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電大東亞戰爭現已進入一決戰階段，空軍實操勝敗之關鍵，日本國民爲擊滅英美爭取最後勝利起見，特自動發起捐款獻機運動，全國人民紛紛響應，踴躍捐款。茲以捐欽購得戰鬥機三百三十四架，「直協」機十一架，輕轟炸機七架，偵察機三架，以及重轟炸機二架，共計三百五十七架。定於二十日之航空　念日下午一時，在此間羽田機場　重舉行命名與禮，由陸軍大臣東條大將親自命名。（周時日本陸軍新銳戰鬥機「鐘馗」重轟炸機「吞龍」及偵察機「司偵」等並參加表演，預料屆時必有一番盛况。</p>

<p>（丁）附則，　各省市黨部根據本綱要，得自行擬訂實施辦法，惟須呈經中央核準，　各特別黨部各辦事處通用本綱要。</p>
<h3>各省市今日召集　食糧增產會議　糧部派員分別指導</h3>

<h3>那不勒斯迤南　戰事激烈進行　德軍與英第八軍接觸</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中　社電　　通社軍事訪員稱：前日英軍續有增援在卡斯蒂拉巴特Castellabate登陸，那不勒斯迤南戰事遂已進入第二階段。在第一階段戰事中，德軍包圍　軍排砲之猛轟，進展被阻，致未能將克拉克將軍業已愧不成軍之師旅逐至　上，但　第五軍仍在危機狀熊之中。直至前日英軍增援在阿格洛波里Agro。qoli卡斯蒂拉巴特里柯蔭勇Caqelicosa登　，以壓力加諸德軍後，美第五軍始稍獲喘息之機會。登陸之英軍增援皆爲英第八軍之部隊，協約軍兵力旣衆，且有空軍爲助，故德軍陣地巳於的日轉移至東南面，昨日該處已展開激戰，德軍一再反攻，予敵軍之根失極爲重大。</p>
<h3>英美蘇外長會議　下月初舉行　傳艾登抵蘇京</h3>

<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電話德國新聞社訉，傳英外相艾登業巳抵　英斯科。</p>
<h3>日第四次航空紀念日　駐華艦隊報道部發言人談話</h3>
<p>中央社滬訉　此問日駐華艦隊報道部發言人以九月二十日値第四次航空紀念日，特就目下在南北太平洋或中國大陸展開之美國空軍反攻企圖作如次談話：　此次世界戰爭由於科學之日　進步，其外貌逐漸蛻變爲猛烈而深刻之兵　戰，蓋吾人應注意往昔在平面戰轉換爲女體戰時，其度度長度以及深度態不能興昔日互相比較，規模愈大，情形愈複雜，尤以近代海戰較陸　戰更需要科學戰，此種事實對於明　飛機日新月異而航空戰不間斷之人，立即可以理解者。</p>
<p>馬來海戰　過去曾以海軍　向世界夸示之英國，在馬來海面一戰而喪失其　於把握海上擁之自信力，彼國會指出日　飛機對其艦船之威猛無比作爲理由。　英國自歐戰勃發以來，在最初二年間，認爲日本空軍非如過大評價之有力，但隨大東亞戰爭發生後，日水海軍航空部隊於馬來海面先後擊毀威爾斯親王號，萊怕斯號。等，至此英國之對日作戰觀念乃被完金推翻，據英力所稱，威爾昕親七號及衆伯斯號等戰艦綫然在地中海中遭遇任何飛機襲擊亦不爲所動。</p>
<p>但如此大言不慚，羅此馬來海戰一役而受慘烈打擊，至此美國方面，到其批評謂英國海軍已達最大革命期，甚至稱英國海軍巳倒退至第三流矣。　最近在南太平洋戰綫　　之敵反攻企圖亦極頑强，翼逞其所謂奪回失地之夢想，但敵人覺悟所受損害慘重，今仍敢與吾人正面對持，其理由何在。　敵人企　　確保戰略要點及在作戰　地網擊戰，　奪回獲得補充行反攻也。</p>
<p>海空連擊　美國於反擊作戰上所　現之　　，　乎彼　在棋布　一無奮日，即可窺見其一般。美國　利用此法自此島至彼是逐一　得航空基地，以其所有航空兵力集中該處，一舉攻擊效果接近　方之日本根據地，完成航空部隊之前滬基地綢，以此是方根據地包括入　炸圈內，然僅　航空兵力　行前進，結果　足使業巳前　之航空茶地與部隊孤立於在日本制　權下之海面，　能推進之航空基地須待後方海軍關於艦隊之配佈，　專以艦隊配置於北太平洋東南太平洋及西南太平洋方面，此實為敵人翼圖對日木在太平洋方面之强力海上權力實行反攻，由此並可證明美國海軍匯次焦急欲獲得制海權，以備應付航空決戰。　在美國輿論中有新意見，認為在飛機高度發達之現代地圖，應以北極爲中心加以威夷亦非雨太平洋實爲阿拉斯加，阿　申群島</p>
<p>從嚴監視　揣測美國現在最希望之對日空襲據點爲利用中國大陸，吾人對暴略侵入姿態宜加防衛監視，不稍懈怠，而在近代作戰上，不問陸地或海上，飛機爲担任火砲之在務者，此種火砲威力可祇戰艦上所置巨炮。現在美國國內主張將空軍提高爲獨立戰略單位之論詞，以及轟炸歐洲大陸之主張，英首相前對美國議會會甲述僅以空戰即能予以決定性的打　云。但如上述始終一貫之敵人空中攻學，實為決定戰時下，　人之全體行動者。</p>

<h3>華商證券交易所　復業準備就緖　設監理會嚴察業務</h3>
<p>昨據上海社記者向某證券界權威人士探悉，華商證券交易所復業之各種準備，頃已完全就緖，下月中旬，必能復業開拍。</p>
<p>嚴加督察</p>
<p>華商證券交易所之復業，對於工商及金融各界均有密切之關係，是以實業部財政部決予嚴加監督，並依據交易所監理會暫行規定第一條第二項之規定，設立交易所監理委員會，負責檢査交易所之一切事務，例如證劵上塲交易，必須得監委會之許可，否則決予取締，此外監委會亦得隨時査察經紀人之營業概况，及各種往來帳冊，如一旦發現有舞弊情事，即予以相當之制裁。</p>
<p>防止操縱</p>
<p>此次經紀人名額，經財政實業兩部嚴格審核結果，約有經紀人二百家左右，均巳有相當準備，査證券交易所依照章程規定，營業範圍爲各項證券之現期及定期買賣，惟爲防止投機操縱起見，對期貨之買賣暫不承做，至於營業方針，買賣證券之種類，則早巳決定云。</p>
<h3>滬巿上週間各業趨勢</h3>
<p>本市物價趨勢，在當局嚴格監管之下，巳逐漸好轉，終因　民購買力不强，各零售商號　均「大減價」為號召，以其將大宗國貨貶價脫手，同時一般投　商人尤受嚴重威脅，鼠竄不定。茲將上週各業買賣情形，探　如下。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>週初　迄週六止，頗呈　勃氣象，買方吸　殊　，人心亦甚堅挺，　貨者不願照價脫手，反之，警方需　殷繁，故全滬市况甚爲活躍。</p>
<p>米糧</p>
<p>因當局正在積極推展統制政策，矧各地新貨已逐漸運此應市，人心瓦解不振，買　均頗　稀，全週價格鮮有榮辱，造至週未終下挫未已。</p>
<p>日用品</p>
<p>週初適逢秋節，商人銀根奇緊，况走銷滯呆，市勢　一蹶不振，節後銀根步鬆，加以配給制度猶無實行確期，乃持貨者轉脫爲吸，人心亦漸堅挺，結果捲烟大英，老刀終被非法做高，其他各貨仍維原盤。</p>

<h3>航空擊滅戰與日本的戰力</h3>
<p>— 宮崎世龍</p>
<p>在大東亞戰爭之初，日海軍航空部隊長驅空襲停泊於夏威夷珍珠灣內的美國太平洋主刀艦隊，悉數予以擊滅，　後又在馬來半島海面擊沉了英國的東亞艦隊主力威爾斯親王號及雷柏爾斯號，關於壯烈的行動，値得予以分析，同時對於過去海戰的觀感，也須加以修正，班者並非專家，但是也曉得既有航空母艦，在海戰中就會右飛機的戰鬥。可是總以爲海戰是以軍艦作戰爲主的，豈知英國誇稱不沉艦的威爾斯親王號及雷柏爾斯號等僅由航空部隊把它擊沉了，可以證實飛機的戰力在海洋是如何的偉大。</p>
<p>雙方都用不帶飛機的軍艦來作戰，這也可以叫做純海戰的戰鬭，在今日的塲合，南太平洋方面展開的壯烈戰鬭，不論陸海兩路，總有航空部隊的活動，如不先獲制空權，休想在海上，陸上獲致勝利。我以爲確保最後勝利者，當然是陸上部隊，可是，在大戰開始之初，利用航空部隊來獲得制空權，這是第一目標，我敢斷定有了這個制空權　然後制海權也可以得到，有了制海權，那麼制地權是必然可以得到的了。</p>
<p>航空擊滅戰的意義</p>
<p>今日在南太平洋展開的激鬭，就是爲了要獲得制空權的所謂「航空擊滅戰」，大東亞戰爭以來，日本海陸軍的作戰，勢如破竹，足跡所至，如入無人之境，僅在三，四個月之間，已經攻克菲律賓，馬來半島·緬甸·婆羅洲·西里怕斯·爪哇·蘇門答臘及所羅門羣島等英美據點，粉碎其對日包圍陣綫，此種局勢，足以威脅印度及澳洲。敵國英美自前年起準備反攻，對日方反擊，所以調集了大批飛機，艦船及兵員，先想奪回所羅門羣島方面，直到本年八月，發動奪囘喀達爾加納爾之戰爲止，費時凡一年。他們又企圖北進，今日戰火巳遍及整個所羅門羣島及新幾內亞島，敵國英美奪回一島再想攻一島的作戰，所付的犧牲極大，他所以要付此且大犧牲的代價，爲的是要獲得下一次攻勢中所不可缺的航空根據地，因之，航空擊滅戰愈演愈烈，雙方的抵消增大，這是必然的結果，現在正是展開一大消耗戰的時候。</p>
<p>日美飛機品質相等</p>
<p>據美國宣傳稱：美國的飛機生產量，每年可造十二萬架。這是美國竭全力以赴的生產數，恐怕從本年起，美國的飛機生產量，將步步减低。</p>
<p>在日本又如何呢？其生產力，在量的方面，本年底或許明年初，可以和美國並駕齊驅，明年底，可以駕乎美國之上，這都是專家的見解。在質的方面，彼此各有特長，未可輕下斷語。例如美國在渝空軍，皆傾力於裝甲防禦機能，防備對方的火力，要應付這一點，祗要增强火力，或調整速度與駕駛性，就控制敵機，增大了裝甲防禦機能與火力，就會减低飛機的速度，速度要是太高，則駕駛性趨弱，所以在空中戰鬥中，就不能充分活動。在質的方面，各有限制，雙方都在苦心研究，實騐，瀝盡心血，各謀進步。但就目下在南太平洋展開之空戰實况觀之，或就在渝美空軍之戰鬥結果觀之，我敢斷言日本戰鬥機的性能是絕對優秀，決不讓英美飛機專美於前，更敢誇口說一句，科學日本，決不亞於英美。</p>
<p>日本航空技術較敵優秀</p>
<p>再論到在航空戰中操戰勝之重大因素者，就是航空技術，也就是戰鬥技術，日水人的體質去當空軍人員，比了英美人適宜，這是事實有生理學可資證明的，况且在空戰中的苦幹精神，尤非英美可以望其項背，這些事實，不用繁複介紹，在過去的戰爭中，都已表現得非常明白，尤其世界聞名的日本軍那種不怕死精神，這更不是英美人趕得上的，日本軍的這種精神，不但在陸海空各戰塲充分發揮，就是在國內一切生產部份與科學硏究部份，處處都可以見到，絕不若敵國英美宣傳所說。日本作戰以來，雖巳六年，　戰力愈來愈厚，竟有力大不知其底之概。大本營陸軍報道部長，關於日本的軍需生產力，曾經這樣說過：「飛機不但在質的方面不亞於美國，卽就是在量的方面，現在也不亞於美國。」這不是空言。再說到人的資源，美國爲了增大航空兵力，所以把那些僅僅受了一點短時期速成訓練的學生航空兵，巳經派到南太平洋方面參加作戰。在日本方面，自本年初起，開始積極訓練海陸航空學生，美國的人口是一萬萬二千萬，日本的人口是一萬萬，日水雖巳作戰六年直到最近方始着手訓練學生，而美國開戰距今不遠，却巳窮相畢露，這可以證明日本在人口資源上如何餘俗。</p>
<p>長期戰於敵不利</p>
<p>目下美國傾其全力從南方開始對日本本土反攻，不惜　大犧牲，企圖前進，原因是這樣：美國如果在短期內不結束戰爭，則其國內將生不測，同時，如任戰爭拖長，日本在大陸及南方將完成培養戰力的建設，因此種種，所以他急於要結束戰爭，換句話說，就是長期戰於他不利，而有利於日本。最後，有一點必須加以說明的：目下美國在南大平洋方面調集陸海空大軍，付以重大犧牲，方始稍獲戰功，這一點在戰略上觀之，因爲他握有所謂澳洲的廣大兵站根據地，處於有利的立塲，我日本距離本國較遠，處於比較不利的立塲，是以一時之得失，固不足影響大局。縱使他們奪回了一切目的所在的南方地區，而日本今後在比較有利的地點，仍能反　反攻而展開殲減戰，日本軍在日俄戰爭中，未嘗挿進俄國領土一步，而在奉天大會戰中，終於壓倒俄軍，獲得全勝，在大東亞戰爭中雖未直接攻擊美國本土，但在大東亞海域一戰，巳足使美國崩潰。所謂美國本土大空襲等等，日本的航空技術上，決不是幻想，歷歷事實是我們現在所經歷的。（企靑譯）</p>
<h3>時局防空須知</h3>
<p>日本內務省於本年六月二十八日編成「時局防空須知」一書，指示各種新的防空方法，供一般家庭及保甲應用，原文戰本年六月二十九日西部每日新聞，茲迻譯如下，以供我們的參考。</p>
<p>防空必勝的誓言一·我們是「保衛國家的戰士」，拚命守護崗位。一·我們有必勝的信念，戰至最後一分鐘。一·我們積極訓練，完成準備，建立自信。一·我們服從命令，不採取自由行動。一·我們互相扶助，協力擔任防空。</p>
<p>引言</p>
<p>敵機不斷的窺伺着空襲的機會，也許於什麼時候，從什麽地方的陸上基地或航空母艦來襲擊。在廣大的天空中，將敵機一架，也不給它逃走全部擊落，這是很困難的。國民應該覺悟時常可以受到空襲。所以平日要作有益於任何空襲的準備，加以充分的訓練，即使在非常時也不會慌張混亂，很鎭　地保衛國家。</p>
<p>第一遭受怎樣的空襲呢</p>
<p>豫想中的空襲是怎樣的呢？</p>
<p>一、空襲的目標　大都市是主嬰的空襲目標，自不待言；但中小都市及在進行戰爭上所必要的運輸交通生產的重要地方等，也是空襲的目標。</p>
<p>此外，爲欲挫折國民的戰　，任何地方都是毫無分別的要加以轟炸的。</p>
<p>二，空襲的時刻　利用黎明或月夜，這是很多的。此外，爲着沒有發出警報、突然空襲也未可知、</p>
<p>三，寬襲的程度　飛機的性能逐漸改良，數量也增加得很快，今後有反復遭受大規模的空襲之　。</p>
<p>四，投炸彈　以燒夷彈爲主，炸彈也是使用的。燒夷彈有　子，油脂，黃燐等多種。有使用許多的小型燒夷彈，與燒夷力很大的大型燒夷彈的，又有併用炸彈的。炸彈爲欲被壞重要部分，也可以使用大型的。其中也有投下後，經過一時或數日以上，突然爆發的時限炸彈。</p>
<p>投下燒夷彈和細菌彈時、難以斷言不用檢射擊。此外，也有散布傳單和燒夷紙片，或抛　偽做玩具或自來水筆的謀略彈的，在空襲時，我們這邊的高射砲彈片會落下來，這也是非注意不可的。</p>
<p>第二　所謂防空</p>
<p>所謂防空　是爲要發見敵機，先施行防空監視，發出警戒警報和空龔警報，通知敵機來襲的危險，實施燈火管制或改變外表，撩亂敵機的視綫；先作其他各種準備，倘受敵機轟炸，防止火災：救護受傷的人，修理被炸壞的房屋道路橋樑等，盡量减少空襲的損害。</p>
<p>這防空，是與陸海軍的防衛相呼應而施行的，軍民同心協力，克服任何困難，爲各自的任務邁進，才能鞏固無隙可乘的守護。</p>
<p>第三　防空的組織</p>
<p>防空上最重要的，是各人以全力守護崗位。因此，自衛防空機關，在家庭防空有保甲，在官署，學校，工廠，銀行，公司等，有特　防護團。自衛防空機關人手不足或力所不及時，警防團，警察局，消防隊，及市鎭村的防空機關等，一齊出發，作防空的活動。此外，擔任防空監視的，有防空監視隊，學校報國隊的防空助理員，輔助警察局，消防隊，警防團等活動。警防團，保甲，特設防護圈，學校報國隊等，須作有秩序的活動，所以平日要互相密切連絡，準備，訓練。擔任指揮的人的指揮能一力的向上，尤爲重要，</p>
<p>現在是在實施防空中。有備則無患，平日應作下面的各種準備，時常檢點，再三訓練，以期無論何時都可應用。</p>
<p>家庭方面　防火材料（甲）水量　房屋面積未滿一分者，貯水一百公斤（約二石），在一分以上者，每五分鐘加水量五十公斤（約五斗），其　依此類推。容器　用水塔，洗浴水桶，天水桶，木桶、盆，吊桶　，水也盡可能用井水，池水，流水等。位置　硏究房屋的構造及避雖所的位置，燒夷彈無論落到什麼地方，要來得及立刻布置。</p>
<p>（乙）將五十公斤（約五斗沙石或泥土，分作兩份一份用雙手捧取投擲，一份裝入口袋中投擲（布袋或紙袋，每袋裝二升）。（丙）蓆苞各數張。（丁）澆水吊桶或有柄桶。（戊）火棍。（己）鷹嘴鈎或長棒（庚）水勺子。　防空服裝　使用對於防空活動便利的現成的束西。爲了使皮膚不露在外面，可用帽子或包頭·手套·襪子或皮鞋，覆蓋頭部與肩膀的鐵兜，墊子等。</p>
<p>（三）防毒面具　到當局所指定的地方去置辦。　燈火管制用具。　蠟燭或小電燈。　手提口袋。　三角布，裹傷布　豫備現成的東西，先用水煮沸或用蒸氣消毒。　避難所一定要設在當局指定的地方。如果設在木製的住宅內，容易出去的地板底下或屋外的地下，都可以。萬不得巳時，效力　小，但不妨設在地上或地板上設在地板上，如有妨礙日常生活，就應先作準備，警戒警　發出後，就同時設置避難所。　關於防火及燈火管制等、須先派定家人的任務　將房屋的四周整瑰妥當，打通和鄰居的走路，　　先在天花板或地板底下做好洞穴，以便從那裏看出去，立刻可以發見燒　彈落下的地方，　　將壁廚，衣櫃，及放在屋頂上地板下的容易燃燒的東西，收拾淸楚　　將不需要的燈火，預先熄滅。　　不要隨便離開住宅不在家裏的時候，應和鄰居或甲長（甲長以外，如有指揮該甲防空的人，則指此人而言，以下同，取得連絡。</p>
<p>保甲方面　防火材料（甲）水量貯水一立方公尺以上。井水，池水，流水等、都可使用。（乙）務必用手提水龍。（丙）梯子，繩。（丁）鏟成鍬。　設置防護監視所，並製造防護監視員的避難所。（三）關於空屋及倉庫的警戒，　預先商議妥當。（四）甲長派定防空人員（能作防空活動者）分担防護監視，防火，連絡等（五）甲長先査明最近的警防團辦事處，警　消防官署，救護所等的地點及其電話號碼，通知該甲居民。（六）甲長規定與鄰近各甲的連絡及援助方法等。（七）甲長隨時檢點該甲內的防空準備，有不充分或不好的地方，設法改正。</p>
<p>計劃</p>
<p>無論何時何地，燒夷彈及炸彈等投下來，也能立刻應付、爲要達到此目的，家庭和保甲，都應特別注意地計劃下列的事情　能作防空活動的人，全部担任防空。　應付盡與夜，暇日與平日，人數雖然减少，也不會妨害防空活動。　適當地規定防空用具的數量及布置地點等。</p>
<p>訓練</p>
<p>計劃很周密，用且很完備，但若訓練不夠，仍無濟於事。不但當局發命令的時候，而且家庭和保甲在各種塲合上，尤其在防空活動極困難的夜　和黎明，或不便作防空活動的地方，很切實地施行訓練，其結果，糾正不滿意之點，又重行訓練，而有必勝的自信，這是最切要的。</p>
<p>其二　警戒警報發出以後　穿防空衣。　檢點防火所需用的水，如有不足，即補充。又在各種容器裏盛滿水，務必做到即使發出空襲警報、也沒有準備水的必要。　檢　澆水吊桶，沙石蓆及其他防空用具，布置於使用便利的地方。&lt;　房子裏的紙門和玻璃門，將沒有會麽用處的都卸下來，放在適當的地方。（五）容易燃燒的危險物品，置於安全之處。　準備使用避難　。地板上有　造避難所的布置的地方，就立刻建造。　防空人員都住在家裏待機。倘若出去，馬上間來。有不得巳的事故必須出去時，與鄰居成甲長取得運絡。　晚上要準備着，施行　戒管制，立即會轉移到空襲管制。</p>
<p>保甲方面　　　甲長迅速傳達警報。　甲長檢點該甲內的情形，完成防火所需用的水及其他準備。　防護監視員準備隨時執行任務。</p>
<p>其三　空襲警報發出以後　整齊防空所需用的服裝。　解開門，倉庫，堆房裏的鎖。　如有救火皮帶，使勁接在自來水籠頭上。自來水不要貯積起來。　與鄰居相連接的閘板及玻璃門，爲防止延燒，全部閉上，不過不要有上鎖閉。與鄰居不連接的玻璃門，惟恐損壞或發生危險，還是卸下或開放。開放時，假使附設着閘板或窗幔，　將閘板或窗幔拉到玻璃門那邊。和鄰居不連接的其他的閘板，儘可照舊不動，但須無碍於防空活動。爲了防止碎玻璃片因炸彈而向四周飛散，預先黏貼紙張，也是一個方法：可是由於炸彈的威力的程度及地位，仍要飛散開來，所以應該極力注意，避免危險。</p>
<p>將房子裏的紙門卸下，放在無妨碍的地方，或者開放。</p>
<p>不能作防空活動的人，到避難所及其他安全之處去躱避。</p>
<p>家產及器具，不可拿出去。</p>
<p>晚上施行空襲管制的一切處理完舉後，負防空責任的人再檢點一次；除防護監視員以外，防空人員鄱即刻到可以避難的屬內去待機。</p>
<p>保甲方面　甲長迅速傳達警報。　甲長分派防護監視員。　甲長警戒空屋及倉庫。　甲長檢點該甲內的狀况，改良不完備的地方。</p>
<p>其四　敵機飛來以後　防護監視員發見敵機，或聽到轟炸聲和砲聲，，然　到預定的避難所去躱避，注意以後的情形，等危險過去了，防備下次的空襲，担任防護監視。　得　防護監視的通知，其他防空人員鄱在預定的避難所待　。　也有連續遭受空襲的，防空人員須注意這一點不可疎忽。</p>
<p>其五　燒夷彈投下以後轉入第四版　　發出空襲警報以後！</p>
<p>火車照常行駛（限制乘客）</p>
<p>緊急電話</p>
<p>一區</p>
<p>警　察　署　撥或叫　１５８８０</p>
<p>消　防　處　撥或叫　１５４４０</p>

<p>家庭方面</p>
<p>防空人員迅迅担任防火，同眸大聲通知近鄰。</p>
<p>防火的方法：</p>
<p>（甲）最初的一分鐘、是最要緊。</p>
<p>（乙）無論是怎樣的燒夷彈，將水澆在四周的容易燃燒的物品上　防止延燒，這是第一，</p>
<p>（丙）適慶燒夷彈的種類及情形。而作下列的處置：電子　夷彈　用水　濕蓆苞擲出去，或　水澆在上面。或投沙袋，抑止　夷彈的火。燒夷彈火勞弱的，趕快拿鐵鏟扒　　外。油脂燒夷彈　用水浸濕蓆苞擲出去，或將水澆去，或拿吊桶和鋁鏟投擲沙土，消滅油脂的火。</p>
<p>黃燐燒　彈　將水澆　　結而燃燒　的黃燐上，或用水沒濕蓆苞澆過去，或拿吊桶和鐵鏟投擲抄土，消滅火燄，然後用鐵鏟撇出去。飛散而燃燒着的黃燐、拿在水裏浸濕的　棍擊滅，　用水澆減之。手足切不可碰着黃燐。</p>

<h3>上海游泳的檢討　溫敬令沈郇明等為男女傑出人才　今後應當克服一切困難積極推進</h3>
<p>— 兆安</p>
<p>游泳人才，我　向來缺少；上海　是逼商大埠，亦感　乏，查上　於柏林舉行之世　會，我國能任游泳代表着，僅陳振　　　　　二人；於世運首代次預賽中好告落選，且成績　距甚遠。又奪前第六屆全國運動會。上海游泳代表頗多，結果冠亞季軍三席，皆為廣東香港馬來等奪去。上海僅　　得名列第四。由此中知過去查我國游泳界一斑。自　變後，孤上游泳比賽，幾倍全邵停頓，游泳員大都離散。各游泳池亦相　停止開放，致上海之游泳人才，便感恐慌。最近上海體育會與上海青年會體育部　合舉辦之全　公開華人游泳比賽，含有重振水上運動煮　；茲僅就此範圍，略加檢討，俾資引起各方注意，並蘇以作練習游泳者之參考。</p>
<p>缺乏人才原因</p>
<p>上海游泳人才缺乏原因，可歸納為下列五點：　游泳運動，雖亦有人提倡，伹缺少有力及有計翻推動，故雖收宏效。　因天時關係，僅夏季可以游泳，且限於七八兩月內，。其餘時間過寒，不宜水上運動。　游泳池太少，目前更少；至於海灘游泳塲。除前　橋海水浴塲外，可謂別無他處，　我國人體魄，或因環境關係，或因攝生不良，身體大都復弱，對於游泳成績，有莫大影響。　國人中雖有諳游泳者，惜大都缺乏基本技術訓練；其有多年游泳經騐而無良好成　者，比比皆是</p>
<p>今年游泳成績</p>
<p>職是之故。此次全　公開華人游泳比賽中，充滿上開現象，查此次參加比賽人數，男子共一百零四名。女子僅十四名，其臨陳逃脫者，亦皆包括在內，若以全　四百萬人口與此數目比較。誠微乎其微。且細察此批游泳員技能　常　。大都未　訓練，例如出發。游動·呼吸·轉身，全稱游動，以及氣力運用與支配等，多屬幼稚，其中半途力歇而停止者，為數煩衆。其可以使人滿意者，估極少數；足見本市一般游泳水準之低。</p>
<p>個人技術探討</p>
<p>至於個人技術方面，吾人研究一游泳員有無成就，可從下列三準則求之：第一</p>
<p>（自左至右）沈　明編天譽程錦倩三女士，篇日今上海最優秀之女游泳家，在九月六日全　公開游泳比賽中，有良佳之成績。</p>
<p>水上女英雄</p>
<p>視其身體結構，是否高大；肌肉輕　飽滿，骨節　活；肺量廣關；　及氣力是否尤足。第二，測　其　氣時間是否長久：身體浮於水面，能否浮得高：倘偌用力量，其　　能否較人快。第三，觀察其出發，游動姿勢，呼吸。轉身及運用氣力等技能，是否止　而　練　熟。根　上三項標準，以檢討各游泳員技術之尚下可無若何差錯。此次比賽中。獲男子組金塲冠軍之溫敬令，除身軀尚　不夠高大及肌肉稍硬外，餘皆合標準。其轉向技術，特別出　，　百米自由式世界紀錄保持者美人米愛米，同出一種手法：游程用力，亦顅有規範，每游一池，兩手輸　次數，計一百碼用十次，四百碼及八百碼用十一二次，每輸撥一次之呼吸，亦甚有節奏，可謂一老游泳員矣，王中成以仰泳　長，骨飾　　　，倘能　身體　肥小許　氣力　足　成　當順有進步，男游泳員之身材，以　守　最合標準　且氣力甚大，　最近疏於練習，　轉身法　耐勞力低落　否則當不　　中成包辦此次仰泳：陸惠　　身體短小，氣力不足。但練　極　力，自由式與泳頗具老練；其缺點為情緒不穩定，易於　怒，不能集中精神於比賽，乃其致敗原因，白威　身體瘦長，速度頗伴，惟轉身小得法。此乃渠最大缺　，否則在一二百碼自由式中，可與湯攷令一爭長短。至於蛙泳。最重要者　兩腿；陳最忠確係可造之才，所不爭氣者為兩腿太短，耐勞力不强，後起蛙泳曹與　身材甚合標準，惟經騐不　富，嗣後努力練習，必能成為蛙泳名將。女子組沈郇明，於此　比賽中，身體最能浮，氣力最足，自由式較仰泳高明，與男子全運會選手陳　南犯同樣毛病，即　　踢動不大活　，若能改正此點，將來極有希望　程錦倩係女子身材最適中之人　自由式姿勞甚佳，除出發，轉身及　用集力尚須研究外，可謂一無　疵。劉天　蛙泳較自由式成功，此次參　自由式比賽　成績不差；交來能使兩臂力增加，　足踢動　活，成績定能提高　　秀珍仰泳　勢，可　上乘，惜身材　小　氣力不足，倘能加以良好鍛煉，當可出入頭地。</p>
<p>內篇幅關係，其他游泳　檢時從略）</p>
<h3>球塲花絮錄</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>此次保傳盃蒙球　賽中爭雄者　還　後生可長的幾隊，如同仁，華雨，汕隊　隊，老宿隊或中途退出，或零落不全，有人乃以為沒有好球看，其　非然，老實說，現在幾倘籃隊老將，除李　中尚在進步外，其餘精彩不多，例不如長鹿，阿仔，祥龍之息影為佳，反　宣家班，劉家將諸小将之認眞作戰，有生有色，看來過</p>
<p>球迷細味我言，當　余言之非　。</p>
<p>錢旭滄為青年體育家後　之秀，　練球　，　　數年，且每能　練球隊有相當成績。　影本屬第二流脚色，今日一　而混　於第一流球隊中，未　過色，　君脖脖指導之功，不可沒。又悉　影女　球隊亦延　君指導，錄錢君指導女子隊，倘　少　，日後羣女星活　求塲　，看看指導的作風若何，引領以　。</p>
<p>蘇淮足球隊戰東華，其最大的缺　點我以為便是不能利用王實山和李　奔，偏　盤渦李胃，你　　李青的老練資格，豈　關仁寬王實山經易過關，以致　　中途而廢，要是多來幾次　傳，使王實山和李　　上　次，李青一定吃不　，那時以逸待勞王關就可多得機會。所以球晨應該隨時用新戰術，方不失為上　之材。</p>
<p>怪脚胖文　重返申江，從未見其作怪，頗使人失　，據　阿事近來身體欠佳，是則莫可非難，唯我人極盼　　能知所保重，以　球迷　望。</p>
<h3>武漢追憶鱗爪</h3>
<p>— 周佛海</p>
<p>本年六月，到武漢視察一次，也和到別處一樣，引起了許多新的　　和舊囘憶，秋夜雨窗，追　往事，特就記憶所及　出來留作後日的紀念。</p>
<p>謀學在人，成事在天，就是一件把小小的事，也不能照如意算盤去實現。我的計劃，　先視察武漢，再去廣州的，所以打算五月二十七日飛漢。那知道那天天氣異常惡劣，不能飛行，到了二十八日，南京天氣，覺得稍好，以為可以動身，那知氣　報告說沿　氣　不佳，萬不可行，只得又延到二十九日，那曉得那天天氣更壞，我因為二十日以後，南京已有預定的事要做，不能離京，所以武漢之行，暫時祇好作罷，一直到廣州囘來之後，六月二十八日機逹到視察武漢的目的。本來想先到武漢，後到廣州，天却安排我先到廣州，再到武漢，世間的事，那裏能由人算呢！</p>
<p>二十八那天，氣壓很低，也不是飛行的好天氣，我因為不能再　期，主張　險　飛，沿途因濃霧關係，飛得很低。田　鷄犬，都歷歷看的很清楚，因此長江的形勢，和大別山脈的雄奇，都能夠細細的觀覺，「十萬大軍齊能　，彭郎奪得小姑囘」的小姑山，「山高月小，水落石出」的赤壁，都從天空中遠遠的　　，因此，想起長江一帶古往今來的種種史　，不禁　發生「滾滾長江東逝水，浪花淘盡英雄，是非成敗轉頭空」之感，這樣　古傷今，不知不　之間，兩小時半的航程，很快的就到了。</p>
<p>下了飛　，中日各長官，都來歡迎，少不得一番　酬和忙碌　，於是便聽車到怡和村的省府招待所。</p>
<p>我除南京和上海之外，會經工作過的地方，便是武漢和廣州，而武漢來來往往的次數更多，所以對於武漢的印象　深，而値得囘憶的事亦不少。</p>
<p>隨即北上重臨武漢</p>
<p>民國十五年，北伐軍到逹武漢以後的情形，我在　盛衰閱盡話滄桑」一文中，已經說過。十六年離開武漢以後，到了十七年北伐軍到逹北京。七月間隨即北上的時候，又重臨武漢。我們由南京坐軍船到漢口，由漢口坐平漢到北京。當時的武漢，是桂系的勢力。晚上李德鄰（宗仁）在　行公會歡宴我們，當時有兩點使我感觸最深，第一是我們在樓下冠蓋滿堂，感大宴會的時候，程頌　（　）却被軟禁在三層樓的一個不房間裏面，原業李德鄰把唐孟瀟　走之後，便組織了武漢政治分會，推程為主席。以對抗南京。後來忍又把他軟禁起來，而湊巧歡迎我們又在軟禁他的地方的樓下。南京的人為座上客，而用以地抗南京的程頌雲，却變成房裏囚。政治的升沈，人情的冷暖，怎么不叫人感覺　！我當時想程頌孤坐斗室中，聽見樓下軍樂悠揚，歡聲嚐雜，不如如何酸辛和　　！第二是在宴會中，忽有人要大家的字，我當時坐在蔣先生的右首，心裏暗想，看他　幾個甚麼字，他拿着筆沉吟一會，便　出　人定勝天」四個字，因為常時蔣桂之間，已有很　的裂痕，我們知道　早總要兵戎相　，他寫　幾個字，是有深意的。果然第二年，我又隨着西征軍　到武漢。</p>
<p>這次西征，我和楊暢卿（永泰）兩人，都是以個人資格，隨軍幫忙的，沒有甚麼名　和具體任務，所以到了漢口之後，便和蝪卿住在廣東商人揟組織的俱樂部適安總會，有事召見，使到總司令部走走，其餘都是自由的時間，很覺逍遙自在。我覺得這樣半幕僚，半清客的地位，不單很輕松，而且可上可下，甚麼人都見得着，甚麼人也都可接見，不　身分和地位的束縛，會行都有自由。雖然沒有具體的責任和權力，却到　都　人尊重。每日和親　故舊來往談天，在戎馬倥　之中，却能享受清閑之福。那知道不到半月，便奉令　總司令部政治部主任。常時的主任是方子　（覺　），因為他調糊北民政　長，我便被臨時拉夫去應急。當時一無助手，二無準備，眞弄得手忙脚亂。那時湊七現任司法部長羅君强同志，也隨某師　到漢，便請他做主任秘書，七拉八湊的組織了斡部去接收。總政治部駐在學好時南洋史弟烟草公司。十五年北伐軍初到漢口的時候，總政治部也　在這裏。好像漢口的南洋兄弟烟草公司，和總政治部有着不解之錄一樣，就職之後，忙碌了一塲，剛剛佈置就　，就奉令班師囘朝。因此我和武漢，又多了一次　錄。</p>
<p>以後也到了武漢兩三次，例如第一次對　之役，湘鄂　剿　之役，都會到過，不過都只有三四天，沒有可以敘述的。</p>
<p>二十六年，政府西　後，在武漢工作了差不多一年。在這個時期，却有許多不能忘記的經歷。</p>
<p>政府四　，　　我　退往江北，而運命却駐定我退往武漢。</p>
<p>歷來二十年以後，我任江蘇　政府委員兼敎育　長。二十五年春，公傳辭去中央民衆訓練委員會主任委員，政組為民衆訓練部，我被選為部長，仍　江蘇的戰　務，每　往來於南京鎭江之間。二十六年春，奉命把民衆訓練部　囘與公博，專任江蘇職務。所以我本應該隨江蘇省政府，退往揚州的，。那知事變發生後，成立了大本營，其中的第二部，主管政略，熊天　（式輝）做部長，我被任為副部長。後來不久，因為　從室事忙，陳布　任主仟，感覺不夠應付，我又被命兼　從室副主任。後來江蘇省政府改組，顧墨三　陳　夫為主席，和應都易了人，滑稽得很，　有我仍蟬聯，當政府西撤的時候，我覺得江蘇局面雖小，我充　是主管長官，中　的事情雖然重要，我乃是副手，所以自已的意見，打算隨江蘇省政府，移往江北。那知　示這後，却要我隨軍事委員會西　。於是我又到了武漢</p>
<p>從南京撤退到漢口</p>
<p>離京四上的情形，也可借這個機會說一說。南京非常緊張，最後的一雙船，幾天內就要開出，我已被指定坐這雙船動身。忽然漢口來了一個和途電話，却是淑　打來的，原來她由長沙到了漢口。第二天就要坐船來　京。她在事變發生之初，就送小孩回湖南。當時我總覺得事變不會擴大，因為招股據當時中日雙方的形勢來判斷，決定到了相當時期，就會結束，後來會見許多當時當　的日本朋友，他們也　日本當局，當時　沒有預定計劃要擴大。所以我當時的觀察並沒有錯。那時得竟陰錯陽差的擴大而且延長到現在，這不是很悲慘的運命麼？這些政治論，這裏不便多談。我當時因為斷定不會擴大，所以雖然看見許多人搬家，我却不贊成。但是淑慧却獨斷獨行，大規模的準備囘湘。原來我和淑慧，是分疆而治的。我外面政治上的事　她從不過問　至於家庭　內的事，我則向不干預。所以她要送小孩回湘，我也不能陰止。不過肚皮裏暗中奸笑，笑好忙着搬回湖南。不久就要忙着搬囘南京，眞是吃飯閑着不　服，要庸人自　的忙去忙来。那知道以後局勢　這樣演變了如果不是她「一意孤行」先搬回湘，還不知會有甚麼悲慘發生。現在想起來：眞是多謝她的果斷</p>
<p>當　接到她的電話，眞令人進退維谷。　她來，如果她未到而我已先撤退，怎標辦泥？不讓她來，她已於萬難之中，得到船位，明晨就要開船。最後決定聽天由命，只奸讓她來罷。她到南京祗三天，我便　合撤退。淑慧和　世庭女士同來，要替她們弄船位，在當時混亂擁　的情形下，是　不容易的事。正在一　莫展，　爐商景的時候，大約是下午六七時，熊天翼忽然來說，「弄到一個艙位，但是今晚就要上船」。於是便准凄風苦雨的深　，送她們上船了。我這繼把心放下。第二天下午，我也上船了，何敬之等，都在這個船上。當時張文白新任湖南主席，我便和他住一個房間。因為過於疲倦，入夜便睡。眞是「夢裏不知身是客」，一覺醒來，見不是家中常住的臥房，頗為　異，再一細想，乃知已離京了，已離家了！返京何日，歸家無期，不禁　然　下，</p>
<p>來回長沙漢口</p>
<p>到了漢口，便找到了淑　。在漢口住了四五天，雜杳紛亂，莫可名狀。在兵荒馬亂之中，也沒有工作可作，湊巧文白赴湘就職，約我回長沙一迸，我便乘這個機會，與淑慈，君强，世庭乘著文白的專車到了十年不見的長沙。</p>
<p>忙亂一陣之後，便抽　去游岳　山。自從民國二年迸岳　之後，已經二十四年了。現在重臨舊地，好像天涯遊子，浪跡歸來一樣。回想二十四年的光陰　眞如白駒過隙。常讀筆記，說業華富貴，不過黃梁一夢。這個味道，到了這個時候，繼眞正的　騐出來。二十四年中，不知道經道了多少　患艱難，滄桑　幻。過後一想，都還不是一夢！　在遊山的我，和二十四年前遊山的我，有甚區別？不是像二十四年前進山的時候，忽然睡着，一直睡到现在繼醒一樣？當時這樣想來想去，眞有看踴紅塵，立卽披髪入山之感！</p>
<p>在長沙住了一星期，正是陶　曼調停各平的時候，接得漢口的電召。忽然又凡心大動，重行　入十萬經塵之中，離妻別子，再到了武漢。</p>
<p>到漢口住范紹陔（煕　）家中。紹陔，以後在重慶一別，不久卽作古人。如今墓木已拱，回憶故人，不禁黯然！當時陶德曼　解，雖然沒有成功，但是各部機構，各方人員，均已漸漸集齊，於是開始工作。臨時全國代表大會開會之後。接着開中央全體會議。顧孟餘被推為宣傳部長，我被推為宣傳部副部長。當時顧在香港，明知他是不會來的。所以就叫我代理部長。此後一切的思想，言論和活動，因為都是與政治有關係的事，和本刋（古今）的性質不合，所以等待別的機會再說。</p>
<p>不久，淑　也帶着兩個小孩來了，大家都住在紹陔家中。我們覺得小孩子不能跟着我們流浪，要找個定的地方　　。商量好久，沒有安當的地方。我忽然想起在南京時，大家紛紛搬家，城南的搬到城北，而城北的却搬至城南，究竟不知那裏安全。有天，布　騃頭騃腦的忽間蔣先生道：「搬家搬到那裏頂安全？」他回答道：「香港。」想不到香港以後，也要受砲擊，也要被　炸，也要搬家　難。國際關係的風雲變化，那裏能夠預料。當時我想起這句話，便主張香港。淑　起　不　成，以後也同意了。動身那天，我送他們母子三人過江，到武昌的南糊飛機塲，離別，是苦事，在亂離的時候離別，後會無期。尤其是苦事。當時父母子女。依依　別之情，　僅是黯然魂銷四個字所能形容。看着他們飛機去　，　忽忽若有所失的過江返漢。那時香港沒有可靠的友人，淑　能携兒　女，　適人地生疏的地方，我至今又是感激，又是敬佩。湊巧胡　江在港，極力照料，並接在他家中居住。好友　情，至今不忘。不幸筆江乘機失　，也作古人了，追懹舊雨，曷　秋戲！</p>
<p>當時精神上非常煩悶，晚上不是到唐　民　談天，便到　小岩家消遺。當時在武漢的要人，如何雪竹，陳雲暄葉孛孛，楊揆一，范紹該等，幾乎每夜都到少岩家，從盤古開天地談到現在，從北極談到南極，把一天的疲勞和心裏的煩悶，排洩於亂談之中，最後，大吃一頓　富的宵夜，大家各自歸家。當時聚會的人現在只有兩三個常常見面，此外，生離的生離，死別的死別，「盛會不常，盛筵不再。」平時如此，何况戰時，現在朝夕祈禱生離的朋友。不久舊雨重逢，再作盛會。</p>
<p>我因久住紹陔家不大方便，打算另覺房屋。此時淑　在香港佈置就緒，由湖南把楊老太太和吳世庭女士接到香港，將小孩交給他們照料，又飛到漢口來了。此時紹陔忽賦悼亡，於是我們便在法租界租了一樣獨立的房子，搬出居住，當時侍從室在武昌，當時侍從室在武昌，宣傳部本在武昌，後　漢口，每日渡江往來於武昌漢口之間，日子也很容易的　過去。以後消怠一天一天的　張起來，　　不能再住漢口了，於是又送她飛去香港。當時因為消息不佯，所以　別的時候，較先一次尤為　斷。因為雖是生離，在當時戎馬倉　之中，保不定就是死別。　　走後，　民也去香港，少岩家常聚的，也人漸漸　落起來，只有　竹等三四人了。景况　條。令人生孤城落日之感！不久，我也　宣傳部的四移，飛往重慶去了。</p>
<p>武漢陷落前夕</p>
<p>到渝不滿一月，又　召到漢，先住雲竹家，後邊兩儀街交通銀行宿　，原來　民住的地方。這個時候，少岩也舉家　港。我們的夜會，已移到交通宿　，而　　的人更少了，只有雲竹是常務委員，每夜必到，我在漢口又住了三週，那時侍從室已隨節邊到漢口，所以不必渡江，每口只在漢口工作，三個星期中，形勢一天險惡一天，消息一天聚急一天。街上連黃包車都看不見了，天色一黑，家家都關門閉戶，整個武漢三鎭，都變成三座死城，凄慘，嚴　，　森的戰時景象，眞令人觸目驚心。漢口陷落的前一晚，我奉命飛往重慶，布雷則奉命隨即飛往衡山。黃昏時優，至布需處去辭行，當時一別。至今未能晤　。朋儕巾我與布需性情最投，交誼　　。如今南地北，會晤雖期，暮雲春樹，我勞如何。言之不勝心酸，深夜十二時，與雲竹握別後，　赴飛機塲，於錯夜之中，又與漢告別，飛向成都去了。（因為當時重慶還沒有夜航設　。）</p>
<p>前塵舊事觸景生情</p>
<p>這次到武漢，把一切前塵影事，一幕一幕的重映於腦海，使人悵惆，使人辛酸，由飛機塲到怡和村，本可不經江邊，因為　戒的關係，統江邊馬路而行，因此經　老中央銀行，想起二十七年每週來此出席最高國防會議的情形。　過汪先生的　居，想起當時常出入此間，請示並談論時局的情形。進了舊法租界，　福　路見紹險舊宅，房　依舊，而紹陔夫歸，　已與世長辭，人世　常，倍深感　，再機少岩舊宅，想起　日聚會的朋友，風流雲散，天各一方，又不　生寂　之感，總而言之，觸景生情的地方，實在太多了，那能一一的描寫出來？</p>
<p>視察武漢財政特派員公署，中　漢支行和漢品特別市政府，均分別簡單訓話。這些地方，也都是以前常到過的。比如現在的市政府，就是二十七年汪先生辦公的地方，當時也常見我的　　的。</p>
<p>第二日渡江過武昌，漢口，在還都那一年，還來過一次，　於武　，乃是事變后的第一次了，二十七年在武漢的時候，每日差不多都要到武昌，雖然奔波為勞，我却　常數喜過江，　為我　　坐的是　船。沒有甚麼　雜和擁擠。當玩着烟波浩渺，落日　帆的景色，眞令人心廣神怡，尤其是乘風順流而下的時候，立在船頭，大有乘長風破萬里浪的氣慨。這次渡江，覺風景依　，乘風破浪的豪　壯志，似尚不減當年。到省政府視察，並召集行營，省黨部黨政軍各幹都略為訓話，愓省長揆一，約赴珞　山，經閱馬塲時，十六年北伐在這裏開民衆大會的情形，猶歷歷在目。但是現在「塲」早沒有，變為簡單的公園了，到　武漢大學，看見巍峨的建築，沒有破壞，心為之安。可惜絃　之聲早絕，不復聞於今日了。二十六年春的臨時全國代表大會，就在此地開的。當時因為避免空擊，都在晚上開會，而目路上絕無燈光。我和布雷共坐一車，暗中摸索前往，鬧出許多笑話　此情此景，宛如昨日。</p>
<p>由珞珈山進城。登蛇山，步行到黃鶴樓。樓　傾圯，滿目荒凉，不復有當時之盛，漢陽的樹，鸚鵡洲的芳草，早已不可復見了，不過長江雄偉的形勢，猶千古如一日，登高遠望，令人精神為之一振。</p>
<p>天氣奇熱，晚上是張市長范卿的公宴，我正愁着怕熱，他妙想天開。席設在中山公園。我聽見非常高興。中山公園，而積比上海的兆　公園還大，事變以前，就佈置得非常之好，我以前於工作疲勞的時候，也常來此　傲。事變後經市政府擴大和充實，比以前更加林木幽盛，散步其間，俗塵為之一　。不過煞風景的，就是我們所到之處，游人絕跡。因為大批武裝警察，前呼後擁，不待警察號令，游人早已避開，我想：我們像這樣離開民衆，與社會隔離，不單是政治上不是一個辦法，而且還有甚麼人生樂趣呢？不過增方當局，有　戒的責任，也是莫可奈何。</p>
<p>視察張公堤一周</p>
<p>我　關心的，是水災，所以約張市長　着視察張公堤一周。沿途風景　好，不過張公堤如果不是平常有準備，等到臨時水大要「　險」，　是不容易。因為在水大的時候，堤的內外部泉水。一綫土堤，在水的中央，怎樣能抵巨風大　！而且搶險　土，一綫長堤，那裏有土可掘。好在市政府工務　局，在沿提均築有土台，預備了許多土以便臨時應用。自從還都以後，　每年都躭心水災和畢災。因為在兵荒馬亂之餘，如果再來一個水旱之災，人民眞會沒有　類。前年夏天，許久未　，我每日早起晚睡的時候必定看看天氣。如果　晴天萬里，就要躭心，假使是陰　四令，就覺得愉快。有天晚上送影佐中將到門前，他向我敬禮告辭，我却望着天空沒有看見。他問我看甚麼，我告訴他看看今晚有沒有下雨的希望，他恭維我一句道；「這樓眞　是致治　。」其實一個人的心理觀念，是隨着堆位和責任而異的。我若沒有負財政的責任，對於水旱，固然不能說完全漠不關心，但是無論如何，沒有這樣關切。因此，又想起一句　語，就是「到甚麼地步說甚話，做一日和尚撞一日鐘。　有人訉這兩句話，表示中國人只知得過且過，沒有永久遠大的計劃。我却不以為然。如果個個人都能實行道兩句話，那就好了。因為第一句話是表示要適應地位，就是到了做敎員的地步，就要說做敎　的話，到了做官的地步，就要說做官的話。第二句是表示要負責。我們現在只怕到甚麼地步不說甚麼話，當敎員的去談做生意，做官司的專去逢迎。我們也怕做和尚的不去撞鐘。所以一個人要知道自己地們，要明瞭自已的責任，而去完成站在自己地位所應負的責任！</p>
<p>一　上午，分別　見了各方面的人，胸間武漢的近狀。武漢，本本東西有長江，南北有平漢，　漢的交通，站在四通八逹的樞組，而為各方貨物集散之地。現在情形完全不同了。在這樣情形之下，那裏能怪物資缺乏，民生憔悴呢？這種情形，我們萬萬不能令他長此下去！</p>
<p>下午一時，於天期氣清之中，飛離開漢了。比較二十七年十月，皆夜飛離武漢時，自是另一心境。　轉戰「古今牛月刋」　卅一期</p>

<h3>Aspiring Ambition: The Necessary Understanding of Aviation Memorial Day</h3>
<p>Today, our allied nation Japan is enthusiastically celebrating Aviation Memorial Day. The Army authorities also announced the naming of three new Japanese Air Force aircraft the day before, to proclaim them before the great powers. It seems that our nation's people lack too much knowledge about the sky. Although our country's research into astronomy began very early, and ordinary farmers can also acquire some knowledge of climate and celestial phenomena through daily experience, it may not be suitable for the needs of the times, and may not meet scientific conditions. Therefore, generally speaking, our knowledge of the sky is very superficial. However, from the perspective of current needs, and from the trend of scientific and civilizational development, we should not only focus on the development of flat points and lines on the continent and ocean, but also on the three-dimensional development of the sky and land-sea integration. If a country lags behind in research and education in this area, then it will inevitably fall behind and will not be able to stand alongside the great powers in the new world of the future. How can we not catch up with the courage of "soaring ambition"?</p>
<p>From the perspective of the current war, it is a three-dimensional war. Especially in the decisive stage of the Second World War, the power of air warfare is the most important factor in the total national war effort. Whoever can ensure air supremacy can maintain their sea control and assist the advancement of their land forces. Therefore, whether in offense or defense, the struggle for control has become the key to victory in today's great war. It is not an exaggeration to say that air supremacy has a decisive power in this war. We are one of the participating countries, and our people, whether passively protecting their own lives, property, or actively assisting our ally Japan in striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War, must do their best in air defense. Therefore, on the one hand, we must promote air defense movements, so that every person understands the meaning and method of air defense, and the responsibility of cooperating in maintaining social order during air raids. On the other hand, we must assist the government in building an air force, with those who have money contributing funds, and young people enlisting in the air force, so that our vast airspace can be defended.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the future construction of a new post-war order, and the construction of a new country, everything from cultural revival, the development of industry and trade, to the promotion of the rural economy, are closely related to air transportation, radio, and other aerial knowledge and undertakings, and necessary preparations should be made for them today. Therefore, we hope that from today onwards, in the shortest possible time, the following points will be realized for scientific knowledge related to the sky, from astronomy, meteorology, electricity, radio, aviation machinery, air traffic, communication, and transportation: The government should, with the Academia Sinica as the center, and with the assistance of scientifically advanced allied nations such as Japan and Germany, launch a research movement on knowledge about the sky, gradually spreading it to the people. Strengthen scientific education at all levels of schools, especially for universities and specialized schools, with the goal of creating a large number of scientific cadres of this kind. Promote popular science education, on the one hand sorting out our country's inherent old knowledge of celestial phenomena and climate, such as wind and rain divination, and on the other hand introducing the new knowledge about the sky from Japan, Germany, and other countries, and applying it to agriculture and general production. In particular, promote activities such as aviation, gliding, and parachuting, to increase the public's knowledge of the sky, promote air transportation, and cultivate air force talents. For the sake of China, for the sake of the security and co-prosperity of East Asia, we must strive for this cause. These are the points that we must further recognize on Aviation Memorial Day.</p>
<h3>Encouraging the Righteous People to Rise Up and Help Allied Nations Achieve Victory: Mussolini's Radio Address to the Nation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency telegram from Rome, the 19th. According to a Huitong News Agency dispatch, Mussolini delivered a radio address to the Italian people last night: Blackshirt comrades, male and female compatriots, after a long period of silence, the prince once again hears my voice, and you can still recognize it. This is the voice that once shared weal and woe with you. I needed a mental rest, so I only reunited with the world today. It is not convenient to talk at length on the radio, and I also do not want to talk in detail about the past situation, only about what has happened since July 25th. In my life of adventure, there have been some adventurous events that are hard to believe. My conversation with the King of Italy lasted less than twenty minutes, and he had already decided, so there was no hope of understanding, and the crisis was about to erupt.</p>
<p>The End of a Personal Tragedy</p>
<p>Although there is no shortage of ministers resigning and generals being executed in wartime or peacetime, it is unprecedented for someone like me, who has loyally served the king for more than 20 years, to be arrested in the palace and forcibly dragged into an ambulance. Although it was said at the time that I was being taken to a safe place, I knew that this so-called protection was not safe. When I was transferred from Rome to Ponza, the possibility of this conjecture increased. When I was transferred from Ponza to the island of Maddalena, and then from that island to the mountains of Gran Sasso, I was able to confirm that they had decided to extradite me to the enemy. Although I was completely isolated from the outside world, I was convinced that Führer Hitler would remember me with a fraternal affection that was even deeper than camaraderie. When I learned of the armistice agreement, I no longer doubted what its twelfth article meant. The senior officials had indeed told me that I would be held hostage. On the night of September 12th, I had already informed my family that I would never allow the enemy to capture me alive. At that time, the tension in the mountains was extremely high. At 2:00 PM, I saw paratroopers descending from the sky. My guards were so unaware of the seriousness of the situation that they did not even fire a shot. All of this happened within five minutes. From this, we can also see the strict organization of the German army and the dedication of its soldiers. These events are truly worthy of being passed down to future generations, and my personal tragedy has also come to an end.</p>
<p>Taking Responsibility for Cleaning Up the Mess, but the terrible tragedy of democratic countries harming Italy is just beginning. The measures taken by the government after July 25th show that it intends to end Italy's 20 years of glorious history. We are now taking the responsibility for studying the crimes of the chief culprits in the establishment of the Italian Empire and the various aspects of the nation, regardless of the difficulties and dangers. First, the King of Italy is directly responsible. Although he was the one who declared war, all the arguments for defeat and anti-German propaganda were also centered on him. The King of Italy often deliberately took actions that were in line with the enemy's intentions, only occasionally doing so unintentionally. And the crown prince, although nominally the commander of South America, never once visited the battlefield. I had long known that the Savoy dynasty would secretly plot a coup with cowardly generals such as Badoglio and corrupt elements of the Fascist Party. Unexpectedly, before my arrest, the Savoy dynasty had already secretly begun armistice negotiations with the British. This is a shameless act of betraying our German allies. Even after the armistice agreement was signed, the King of Italy still denied that such negotiations were taking place. This is the dynasty that I taught to be in danger 20 years ago, and now it is establishing a new government based on the old laws of 1848, giving the people freedom under the sharp edge of martial law.</p>
<p>Rebuilding the Nation. As for the terms of the armistice agreement, their harshness is beyond imagination. The King of Italy did not want to discuss the content of these terms, nor did he care that I would be handed over to the enemy. All he was concerned about was his throne, and he did not hesitate to plunge Italy into chaos, shame, and pain. His contempt will make every Italian forever despised by others. The result of these shameful acts will affect every Italian. In addition to losing our honor, we will also lose the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea. All of our troops in southern France and the Balkans collapsed within 24 hours. Amidst the laughter of civilians, they were disarmed by our allies. The Italian Royal Navy, which had been built with 20 years of effort, defected to Malta, the old center of British imperialism, which is a hidden danger in the heart of Italy. Fascism has never abandoned the monarchy, but the king has now abandoned Fascism. The King has failed to fulfill his historical mission and has lost the right to exist. The rebuilt nation should be completely nationalized and socialized.</p>
<p>Washing Away Historical Stains with Blood. In order for our movement to exert its greatest power, we first ask our people to rise up and fight side by side with our German and Japanese allies. We can only wash away this great stain on history with blood. We must reorganize our troops, with the Fascist militia as the core. We cannot achieve victory without our own strength. All traitors, especially those who joined the new government after 9:00 PM on July 25th and then defected to the enemy, will be completely eliminated. Abolish plutocracy and build a true social nation with the labor of the people. All Blackshirt comrades and friends, I ask you to arm yourselves together. Although the enemy is happy because of our surrender, this does not mean that they have won. Our allies Germany and Japan are determined to fight to the end and will never compromise with the enemy. May the Blackshirt comrades reorganize their troops, and may the young comrades enlist in the army and become pilots, so that the enemy has no way to attack our towns. May the Fascist female comrades give our people spiritual assistance again. The country is your country. May you do your best to protect it from falling into danger again. With our courage, loyalty, and dedication, we can surely give Italy a new future and live in the light. Long live Italy! Long live the New Fascist Republic!</p>
<h3>Japanese Citizens Dedicate Aircraft: Naming Ceremony Today</h3>
<p>Central News Agency telegram from Tokyo, the 19th. The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage. The Air Force is the key to victory or defeat. In order to destroy the United States and Britain and strive for final victory, the Japanese people have voluntarily launched a fundraising campaign to dedicate aircraft. People across the country have responded enthusiastically and donated generously. A total of 357 aircraft have been purchased with the donations, including 334 fighters, 11 "direct cooperation" aircraft, 7 light bombers, 3 reconnaissance aircraft, and 2 heavy bombers. The naming ceremony will be held at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th, Aviation Memorial Day, at Haneda Airport here. Army Minister General Tojo will personally name the aircraft. (At that time, new Japanese Army fighter aircraft such as the "Shoki", heavy bomber "Donryu", and reconnaissance aircraft "Sishitei" will also participate in the performance. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aviation Memorial Day: Flyers Distributed in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Central News Agency telephone from Nanjing, the 19th. Tomorrow, the 20th, is Aviation Memorial Day for our allied nation Japan. In order to show respect, the Japanese military here, in conjunction with our New Movement Association, invited many Chinese and Japanese elementary school students to ride in airplanes and distribute flyers over the city of Nanjing this morning. For a time, the sky was colorful and beautiful, and the people looked up and picked up the flyers, passing them around and showing expressions of gratification.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Attack New Georgia Island</h3>
<p>Central News Agency telegram from Tokyo, the 19th. The air war between Japan and the United States in the Solomon Islands is intensifying. At dawn on the 18th, Japanese air units again fiercely attacked New Georgia, hitting enemy military facilities, causing two fires and explosions, and four large fires. The Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in the South of Naples: German Forces Contact British Eighth Army</h3>
<p>Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, the 19th. A military correspondent from the Datong News Agency stated: British forces have continued to reinforce their landings in Castellabate, and the fighting south of Naples has entered its second stage. In the first stage of the fighting, the German advance was hampered by the heavy artillery fire of the Allied forces, and they failed to drive General Clark's demoralized troops into the sea. However, the US Fifth Army is still in a critical condition. It was not until British reinforcements landed in Agropoli, Castellabate, and Cilento, putting pressure on the German forces, that the US Fifth Army had a chance to catch its breath. The British reinforcements that landed were all units of the British Eighth Army. With the Allied forces having a large number of troops and air support, the German positions have shifted to the southeast in recent days. Fierce fighting has broken out there yesterday. The German forces have launched repeated counterattacks, inflicting extremely heavy losses on the enemy.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union to be Held in Early October: Eden Reported to Arrive in Soviet Capital</h3>
<p>Central News Agency telegram from Lisbon, the 19th. A diplomatic correspondent from the London Sunday Times reported: Preparations for the foreign ministers' meeting of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are progressing rapidly.

<h3>Fourth Japanese Aviation Memorial Day: Spokesperson for the Fleet Press Department Stationed in China Speaks</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai. The spokesperson for the Fleet Press Department of the Japanese Navy stationed in China, on the occasion of the Fourth Aviation Memorial Day on September 20, made the following remarks regarding the current attempts by the US Air Force to launch counterattacks in the North and South Pacific and mainland China: This world war, due to the daily progress of science, is gradually transforming into a fierce and profound war. We should pay attention to the fact that when the planar war is transformed into a three-dimensional war, its degree, length, and depth cannot be compared with the past. The larger the scale and the more complex the situation, especially modern naval warfare, requires more scientific warfare than land warfare. This fact can be immediately understood by those who are aware of the ever-changing aircraft and the constant air war.</p>
<p>The Naval Battle of Malaya. Great Britain, which once boasted its navy to the world, lost its confidence in grasping maritime power in the Battle of Malaya. It pointed out the unparalleled power of Japanese aircraft against its ships as the reason. Great Britain, since the outbreak of the European War, had thought in the first two years that the Japanese air force was not as powerful as it was overestimated. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy and Air Force successively destroyed the Prince of Wales and the Repulse off the coast of Malaya. At this point, Great Britain's concept of combat against Japan was completely overturned. According to what the British said, battleships such as the Prince of Wales and the Repulse would not be moved by any aircraft attacks in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>However, this boastful claim was severely hit by the Battle of Malaya. At this point, the United States criticized that the British navy had reached the greatest revolutionary period, and even claimed that the British navy had regressed to the third rate. Recently, the enemy's counterattack attempts on the South Pacific front have also been extremely stubborn, trying to fulfill their dream of regaining lost territory. But why are the enemies, aware of the heavy damage they have suffered, still daring to confront us head-on? The enemy's attempt to secure strategic points and attack in the combat zone is to regain a replenishment line and launch a counterattack.</p>
<p>Sea-Air Combined Strikes. The reality of the United States' counterattack operations seems to be generally visible in its one-day efforts in a chess-like distribution. The United States is using this method to gradually obtain air bases from one island to another, concentrating all its air power there, and launching an attack on the Japanese base near the point of effect, completing the forward base network of the air force. This includes the bases in the bombing circle. However, only the forward advancement of the air force results in the isolation of the already advanced airbases and troops on the sea under Japanese control. The air bases that can be advanced must await the rear navy's deployment of fleets. The fleet's deployment in the North Pacific, Southeast Pacific, and Southwest Pacific is a demonstration of the enemy's attempt to counterattack Japan's strong maritime power in the Pacific. From this, it can be proven that the US Navy is anxiously trying to gain sea control in order to cope with the air decisive battle. In the American media, there is a new opinion that in the modern map where airplanes are highly developed, the Arctic should be taken as the center, and Hawaii is not the Pacific but Alaska, the Aleutian Islands.</p>
<p>Strict Surveillance. It is speculated that the United States' most desired air strike base against Japan is the use of mainland China. We should strengthen our defense and surveillance against the brutal invasion, and not slacken in the slightest. In modern warfare, whether on land or at sea, aircraft are the ones who take on the duties of artillery, and the power of this artillery can only be compared to the giant cannons placed on battleships. The current American domestic arguments advocating raising the air force to an independent strategic unit, as well as the claim to bomb the European continent, are similar to what the British Prime Minister previously stated to the American Congress that only air warfare can give a decisive blow. However, the enemy's aerial attacks, which have been consistent from beginning to end, are the ones who determine the overall actions of others in wartime.</p>

The First District Public Office believes that public cooperation is one of the important plans for implementing fixed prices, and therefore hopes that citizens will provide assistance at any time.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Underway South of Naples: German Forces Contact British Eighth Army</h3>
<p>Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, the 19th. A military correspondent from Datong News Agency said that British forces had continued to reinforce their landings at Castellabate, and the fighting south of Naples had entered its second stage. In the first stage of fighting, the German advance was hampered by Allied artillery fire and failed to drive General Clark's already demoralized divisions into the sea. However, the US Fifth Army remained in a critical state. Only after the British reinforcements landed at Agropoli, Castellabate, and Cilento, putting pressure on the German forces, did the US Fifth Army have a chance to catch its breath. The British reinforcements that landed were all units of the British Eighth Army. With the Allied forces having a large number of troops and air support, the German positions had shifted to the southeast in recent days. Fierce fighting has broken out there yesterday. The German forces have launched repeated counterattacks, inflicting extremely heavy losses on the enemy.</p>

<h3>Funding for the Grain Control Committee is Entirely Allocated by the Executive Yuan and Not Collected Externally</h3>
<p>The office of the Rice and Grain Control Committee has decided to use the original office space of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as its office, and it can officially begin operations today. It is reported that the committee's proposed departments include general affairs, purchasing, operations, storage, and distribution, each with specific responsibilities. All necessary funding will be requested from the Executive Yuan and will not be collected externally.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Unsold Yarn and Cloth to be Assisted by the Economic Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>As the yarn and cloth have already been purchased by the National Government, and the deadline for applications for sale by various yarn and cloth manufacturers and holders has passed, the Materials Investigation Committee is undertaking an investigation to determine whether the yarn and cloth held by various manufacturers have been applied for sale. As the First District of Shanghai has the largest number of yarn and cloth manufacturers, it should assist in this investigation to complete the National Government's economic policies. The District Office has ordered investigation personnel to assist in the investigation. If any yarn and cloth are found not to have been applied for sale, they will be handed over to the relevant authorities for punishment according to law, and the seized smuggled goods will be confiscated by the Commercial Control Committee.</p>
<h3>Restaurants and Taverns Not Allowed to Operate Past Midnight</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government believes that as the administration of Greater Shanghai is tending towards unification, the past extravagant and dissolute customs should be effectively corrected. Moreover, during this autumn of national rejuvenation, all citizens should deeply reflect on self-discipline and strive together with one heart and mind. Therefore, it has issued a special order to all its subordinate districts that all restaurants and taverns within their respective jurisdictions shall not operate past midnight from today onwards. Any violations will be severely punished. The police authorities of each district are ordered to immediately instruct their subordinates to conduct inspections at any time.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing to you regarding the article published in your newspaper on the 19th of this month stating that "The Rice and Grain Control Committee is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting tomorrow (the 20th) afternoon."

<h3>Su-Huai Football Team Draws with United Friendship Team, Each Scoring One Goal</h3>
<p>The third match of the Huaibei-Suzhou football team's tour of Shanghai took place at 10:30 AM yesterday at Yiyuan against the United Friendship Team. It was not easy for the Suzhou-Huai team to draw 1-1. The United Friendship Team should have won, but the blame lies with the players for not being able to connect. The goal they conceded was also too careless, causing the Suzhou-Huai team to improve as they played. In the first half, Fei Chunhua of the United Friendship Team scored a goal, and in the second half, Xia Xiechu of the Jiang-Huai team equalized in the last three minutes.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange Ready to Resume Operations - Supervisory Committee Established to Strictly Monitor Business</h3>
<p>Yesterday, our Shanghai correspondent learned from an authoritative figure in the securities industry that preparations for the resumption of operations of the Chinese Stock Exchange have been fully completed and that trading will definitely resume by the middle of next month.</p>
<p>Strict Supervision</p>
<p>The resumption of operations of the Chinese Stock Exchange is closely related to the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance have decided to strictly supervise it. In accordance with Article 1, Section 2 of the Provisional Regulations of the Stock Exchange Supervisory Committee, a Stock Exchange Supervisory Committee will be established to be responsible for inspecting all affairs of the Stock Exchange. For example, the listing and trading of securities must be approved by the Supervisory Committee, otherwise they will be banned. In addition, the Supervisory Committee may also inspect the business operations and various transaction records of brokers at any time. If any fraudulent activities are discovered, appropriate sanctions will be imposed.</p>
<p>Prevent Manipulation</p>
<p>After strict review by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, the number of brokers this time is approximately 200, all of whom have made adequate preparations. According to the regulations of the Stock Exchange, the scope of business is the spot and forward trading of various securities. However, in order to prevent speculation and manipulation, futures trading will not be conducted for the time being. As for the business policy and the types of securities to be traded, they have already been decided.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market Trends for the Past Week</h3>
<p>Under the strict supervision of the authorities, the trend of prices in this city has gradually improved. However, due to the weak purchasing power of the people, various retailers have been promoting "major price reductions" to sell off large quantities of domestic goods at reduced prices. At the same time, general speculators are particularly threatened and are scurrying around aimlessly. The following is an investigation into the trading situation of various industries in the past week.</p>
<p>Public Bonds</p>
<p>From the beginning of the week to Saturday, it presented a thriving scene, with buyers absorbing the goods in large quantities. People's confidence was also very strong, and sellers were unwilling to sell at the current prices. Conversely, the police force needed a large amount of money, so the entire Shanghai market was very active.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain</p>
<p>Because the authorities are actively promoting the control policy, and new goods from various places have gradually been transported here for sale, people's confidence has collapsed and prices have been sluggish. There has been little fluctuation in prices throughout the week, and the situation deteriorated until the end of the week.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, it coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival, and merchants' funds were extremely tight. In addition, sales were sluggish, and the market situation was in a slump. After the festival, funds gradually loosened. In addition, there was no definite date for the implementation of the rationing system, so holders turned from selling to absorbing, and people's confidence gradually strengthened. As a result, British-American Tobacco cigarettes and Old Knife cigarettes were illegally driven up in price, while other goods remained at the original levels.</p>

<p>Commemorative Special Issue of "Air"</p>
<h3>Aerial Annihilation Warfare and Japan's War Potential</h3>
<p>— Seiryu Miyazaki</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese naval air force launched a long-range air raid on the American Pacific Fleet, which was docked in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and annihilated them all. Later, they sank the British East Asia Fleet's main force, the Prince of Wales and Repulse, in the waters off the Malay Peninsula. These heroic actions deserve to be analyzed, and at the same time, the perception of past naval battles must also be revised. The author is not an expert, but he also knows that with aircraft carriers, there will be aircraft combat in naval battles. However, it was always believed that naval battles were mainly fought by warships. Who knew that the Prince of Wales and Repulse, which Britain boasted were unsinkable, were sunk by the air force alone, proving how great the combat power of aircraft is at sea.</p>
<p>Both sides using warships without aircraft to fight can also be called pure naval warfare. In today's situation, the heroic battles unfolding in the South Pacific, whether on land or at sea, always involve the activity of the air force. Without first gaining air supremacy, one cannot expect to achieve victory at sea or on land. I believe that the final winner will certainly be the land forces, but at the beginning of the war, using the air force to gain air supremacy is the first goal. I dare say that with this air supremacy, maritime supremacy can also be obtained, and with maritime supremacy, land supremacy is inevitable.</p>
<p>The Meaning of Aerial Annihilation Warfare</p>
<p>The fierce battles unfolding in the South Pacific today are the so-called "aerial annihilation warfare" to gain air supremacy. Since the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army and navy have been unstoppable, and wherever they have gone, it has been as if they were entering an uninhabited land. In just three or four months, they have conquered the Philippines, the Malay Peninsula, Burma, Borneo, Celebes, Java, Sumatra, and the Solomon Islands, shattering their encirclement of Japan. This situation is enough to threaten India and Australia. The enemy countries, Britain and the United States, began preparing for a counteroffensive the year before last, and launched a counterattack against Japan. Therefore, they mobilized a large number of aircraft, ships, and soldiers, first wanting to recapture the Solomon Islands. It took a year until the Battle of Guadalcanal in August of this year. They also attempted to advance northwards, and today the flames of war have spread throughout the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The enemy countries, Britain and the United States, are paying a huge price for their operation to recapture one island and then attack another, because they want to obtain an air base that is indispensable for the next offensive. Therefore, the aerial annihilation warfare is intensifying, and the offsetting of both sides is increasing, which is an inevitable result. Now is the time to launch a major war of attrition.</p>
<p>Japanese and American Aircraft of Equal Quality</p>
<p>According to American propaganda, the United States can produce 120,000 aircraft per year. This is the production number that the United States is making every effort to achieve, and it is feared that from this year onwards, the aircraft production volume of the United States will gradually decrease.</p>
<p>What about Japan? Its production capacity, in terms of quantity, may be on par with the United States by the end of this year or perhaps early next year, and by the end of next year, it may surpass the United States. These are all the views of experts. In terms of quality, each has its own strengths, and no hasty conclusions can be drawn. For example, the American air force in Chongqing is focusing on armor protection capabilities to defend against the opponent's firepower. To deal with this, one only needs to increase firepower or adjust speed and maneuverability to control the enemy aircraft. Increasing armor protection capabilities and firepower will reduce the aircraft's speed. If the speed is too high, the maneuverability will weaken, so in aerial combat, one cannot move freely. In terms of quality, there are limitations on both sides, and both are painstakingly researching, experimenting, and exhausting their efforts to improve. But based on the actual situation of the air combat currently unfolding in the South Pacific, or based on the results of the battle of the American air force in Chongqing, I dare say that the performance of Japanese fighter planes is absolutely excellent and will never let British and American aircraft monopolize the beauty in front. I dare to boast that scientific Japan is no less than Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Japanese Aviation Technology is More Excellent than the Enemy's</p>
<p>Furthermore, the most important factor in winning in aerial warfare is aviation technology, which is also combat technology. It is a fact that the physique of Japanese people is more suitable for being air force personnel than that of British and Americans, and this is physiologically proven. Moreover, the spirit of hard work in aerial combat cannot be matched by British and Americans. These facts do not need to be introduced in detail and have been demonstrated very clearly in past wars. Especially the world-famous Japanese army's spirit of not fearing death, which the British and Americans cannot catch up with. This spirit of the Japanese army is not only fully displayed in the land, sea, and air battlefields, but can also be seen everywhere in the domestic production and scientific research sectors and is by no means as the enemy countries, Britain and the United States, claim. Although Japan has been at war for six years since the beginning of the war, its combat power is becoming thicker and thicker, and it has an unknown amount of potential. The Chief of the Army Press Department of the General Headquarters once said this about Japan's military production capacity: "Aircraft are not only no less than the United States in terms of quality, but also no less than the United States in terms of quantity." This is not empty talk. Furthermore, in terms of human resources, the United States, in order to increase its air force strength, has already sent student pilots who have only received short-term crash course training to the South Pacific to participate in combat. In Japan, since the beginning of this year, it has begun to actively train naval and army aviation students. The population of the United States is 120 million, and the population of Japan is 100 million. Japan has been at war for six years until recently before it began training students, while the United States has not been at war for long, but it has already shown its poverty. This proves how much surplus Japan has in terms of population resources.</p>
<p>Long-Term War is Unfavorable to the Enemy</p>
<p>At present, the United States is pouring all its strength into launching a counteroffensive against the Japanese mainland from the south, sparing no effort to advance at the cost of great sacrifices. The reason for this is that if the United States does not end the war in the short term, then something unexpected will happen in the country. At the same time, if the war is allowed to drag on, Japan will complete the construction of cultivating war potential in the mainland and the south. Therefore, it is anxious to end the war. In other words, a long-term war is unfavorable to it and favorable to Japan. Finally, one point must be explained: At present, the United States is mobilizing large land, sea, and air forces in the South Pacific, paying a heavy price before making slight gains. From a strategic point of view, this is because it holds the so-called vast supply base of Australia and is in an advantageous position. Japan is farther away from its home country and is in a relatively disadvantageous position. Therefore, temporary gains and losses are not enough to affect the overall situation. Even if they recapture all the southern regions where their goals lie, Japan will still be able to launch a counterattack and annihilation war from a more advantageous location in the future. In the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese army never inserted one foot into Russian territory, but in the Battle of Mukden, it finally overwhelmed the Russian army and won a complete victory. In the Greater East Asia War, although it did not directly attack the American mainland, one battle in the Greater East Asia waters was enough to make the United States collapse. The so-called large-scale air raids on the American mainland, etc., are by no means fantasies in Japanese aviation technology, and the facts are what we are now experiencing.

<h3>Air Defense Knowledge for the Current Situation</h3>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs compiled a book titled "Air Defense Knowledge for the Current Situation" on June 28 of this year, instructing on various new air defense methods for general households and Baojia (group of households) to use. The original text appeared in the Western Japan Daily News on June 29 of this year. We now translate it below for our reference.</p>
<p>Air Defense Victory Pledge</p>
<p>*   We are "soldiers defending the country," desperately guarding our posts.</p>
<p>*   We have the belief that we will win and will fight until the last minute.</p>
<p>*   We train actively, complete preparations, and build confidence.</p>
<p>*   We obey orders and do not take independent action.</p>
<p>*   We help each other and work together on air defense.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Enemy planes are constantly watching for opportunities to launch air raids, perhaps attacking at any time from land bases or aircraft carriers somewhere. It is very difficult to shoot down every single enemy plane in the vast sky and not let any escape. The people should be aware that they may be subject to air raids at any time. Therefore, prepare every day for any air raid, train thoroughly, and do not panic or become confused even in an emergency, but calmly defend the country.</p>
<p>First, What Kind of Air Raids Will We Suffer?</p>
<p>What kind of air raids are expected?</p>
<p>1.  Targets of Air Raids　Large cities are the primary targets of air raids, which goes without saying; however, small and medium-sized cities, as well as important places for transportation, communication, and production necessary for carrying out the war, are also targets of air raids.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to frustrate the people's will to fight, any place will be bombed without distinction.</p>
<p>2.  Timing of Air Raids　Using dawn or moonlit nights is common. In addition, it is possible that there will be sudden air raids without any warning being issued.</p>
<p>3.  Extent of Air Raids　The performance of aircraft is gradually improving, and the number is increasing rapidly. In the future, there may be repeated large-scale air raids.</p>
<p>4.  Dropping Bombs　Incendiary bombs are the main type, but regular bombs are also used. There are many types of incendiary bombs, including electron, grease, and white phosphorus. There are those that use many small incendiary bombs, and those that use large incendiary bombs with great incendiary power, and there are also those that use bombs in combination. Large bombs may also be used to destroy important parts. Among them are time bombs that explode suddenly after a while or several days after being dropped.</p>
<p>When dropping incendiary bombs and germ bombs, it is difficult to say that there will be no strafing. In addition, there may be leaflets and incendiary paper scraps scattered, or trick bombs disguised as toys or fountain pens thrown. During air raids, fragments from our own anti-aircraft shells will fall, which must also be noted.</p>
<p>Second, What is Air Defense?</p>
<p>Air defense is to discover enemy planes, first carry out air defense surveillance, issue alert warnings and air raid warnings, notify of the danger of enemy planes attacking, implement light control or change appearances to confuse the enemy planes' vision; make other preparations in advance, and if bombed by enemy planes, prevent fires: rescue the injured, repair damaged houses, roads, bridges, etc., and minimize the damage from air raids.</p>
<p>This air defense is carried out in response to the defense of the army and navy. The military and civilians work together to overcome any difficulties and advance in their respective missions, so as to consolidate an impregnable defense.</p>
<p>Third, Air Defense Organization</p>
<p>The most important thing in air defense is for each person to guard their post with all their strength. Therefore, self-defense air defense organizations include Baojia for family air defense, and special protection groups in government offices, schools, factories, banks, companies, etc. When self-defense air defense organizations are short-handed or unable to cope, the police defense corps, police bureau, fire brigade, and air defense organizations of cities, towns, and villages will all set out to carry out air defense activities. In addition, there are air defense surveillance teams, air defense assistants from school patriotic corps, assisting the activities of the police bureau, fire brigade, police defense corps, etc., to carry out air defense surveillance. The police defense corps, Baojia, special protection circles, school patriotic corps, etc., must carry out activities in an orderly manner, so they must maintain close contact with each other, prepare, and train on weekdays. It is especially important to improve the command ability of those in charge of command.</p>
<p>Air defense is currently being implemented. Preparation prevents trouble. On weekdays, the following preparations should be made, checked frequently, and trained repeatedly, so that they can be used at any time.</p>
<p>In the Home: Fire Prevention Materials: (A) Water Volume: For houses with an area of less than one fen (approximately 1/6 of an acre), store 100 kilograms (approximately 2 shi) of water. For those with an area of one fen or more, add 50 kilograms (approximately 5 dou) of water every five minutes, and so on. Containers: water towers, bath tubs, sky water barrels, wooden barrels, basins, buckets, and water should also be obtained from well water, pond water, and running water as much as possible. Location: Study the structure of the house and the location of the shelter, so that you can arrange things immediately no matter where the incendiary bomb falls.</p>
<p>(B) Prepare 50 kilograms (approximately 5 dou) of sand and gravel or mud, divided into two parts, one part to be picked up and thrown with both hands, and one part to be put into a pocket and thrown (cloth bags or paper bags, each bag containing 2 sheng). (C) Several straw mats. (D) Watering buckets or buckets with handles. (E) Fire sticks. (F) Claw hooks or long poles. (G) Water ladles. Protective Clothing: Use readily available items that are convenient for air defense activities. To prevent the skin from being exposed, use hats or head coverings, gloves, socks or leather shoes, iron helmets, pads, etc. to cover the head and shoulders.</p>
<p>(Three) Gas Mask: Go to the place designated by the authorities to obtain it. Implements for light control. Candles or small electric lights. Handbag. Triangular cloth, bandage cloth: Prepare readily available items in advance, and boil them in water or sterilize them with steam. Shelters must be located in places designated by the authorities. If it is located in a wooden house, it can be under the floor that is easy to get out of, or in the basement outside the house. If it is absolutely necessary, the effectiveness is small, but it is okay to set it up on the ground or on the floor. If it interferes with daily life, prepare in advance, and set up the shelter at the same time after the alert warning is issued. Regarding fire prevention and light control, the tasks of family members must be assigned in advance. Arrange the surroundings of the house properly, and open up the path to the neighbors. First, make a hole in the ceiling or under the floor so that you can look out from there and immediately find the place where the incendiary bomb fell. Clear away flammable items such as wall cabinets, wardrobes, and things placed on the roof or under the floor. Turn off unnecessary lights in advance. Do not leave the house casually. When you are not at home, contact your neighbors or the head of the Baojia (other than the head of the Baojia, if there is someone in charge of air defense in the Baojia, then this person is meant, and so on).</p>
<p>In Baojia: Fire Prevention Materials: (A) Water Volume: Store more than one cubic meter of water. Well water, pond water, and running water can all be used. (B) Be sure to use a portable fire pump. (C) Ladders, ropes. (D) Shovels. Set up a protection and surveillance post, and build a shelter for the protection and surveillance personnel. (Three) Discuss the security of vacant houses and warehouses in advance. (Four) The head of the Baojia assigns air defense personnel (those who can carry out air defense activities) to take charge of protection surveillance, fire prevention, communication, etc. (Five) The head of the Baojia first finds out the locations and telephone numbers of the nearest police defense corps office, police and fire authorities, and rescue stations, and notifies the residents of the Baojia. (Six) The head of the Baojia stipulates the contact and assistance methods with neighboring Baojia. (Seven) The head of the Baojia checks the air defense preparations in the Baojia at any time, and corrects any deficiencies or problems.</p>
<p>Plan</p>
<p>In order to be able to deal with incendiary bombs and bombs at any time and anywhere, both the family and the Baojia should pay special attention to planning the following things: All those who can carry out air defense activities should take on air defense tasks. Even if the number of people is reduced, it will not hinder air defense activities whether it is day or night, holidays or weekdays. Appropriately stipulate the quantity of air defense equipment and the location of deployment.</p>
<p>Training</p>
<p>Even if the plan is very detailed and the equipment is very complete, it will be useless if there is not enough training. Not only when the authorities issue orders, but also in various situations in the family and Baojia, especially at night and dawn when air defense activities are extremely difficult, or in places where it is inconvenient to carry out air defense activities, conduct practical training. As a result, correct unsatisfactory points, retrain, and have the confidence to win. This is the most important thing.</p>
<p>Secondly, After the Alert Warning is Issued: Put on protective clothing. Check the water needed for fire prevention. If there is not enough, replenish it. Also, fill various containers with water, so that there is no need to prepare water even when an air raid warning is issued. Check watering buckets, sand and gravel mats, and other air defense equipment and deploy them in convenient places. Remove paper doors and glass doors that are of no use in the house and place them in appropriate places. Place flammable and dangerous items in a safe place. Prepare to use the shelter. If there is a place to build a shelter on the floor, build it immediately. Air defense personnel stay at home on standby. If you go out, come back immediately. If you have to go out due to unavoidable circumstances, contact your neighbors or the head of the Baojia. Prepare at night to implement light control and immediately switch to air raid control.</p>
<p>In Baojia: The head of the Baojia quickly conveys the alert. The head of the Baojia checks the situation in the Baojia and completes the water and other preparations needed for fire prevention. The protection and surveillance personnel prepare to perform their tasks at any time.</p>
<p>Thirdly, After the Air Raid Warning is Issued: Put on all the equipment needed for the air defense. Unlock the doors, warehouses, and storage rooms. If there is a fire hose, connect it tightly to the water faucet. Do not store tap water. Close all bulkheads and glass doors that connect to neighbors to prevent the fire from spreading, but do not lock them. As for the glass doors that do not connect to neighbors, they should be removed or opened in case of damage or danger. When opening, if bulkheads or curtains are attached, pull the bulkheads or curtains to the glass doors. Other bulkheads that are not connected to neighbors can be left as they are, but they must not interfere with air defense activities. It is also a way to paste paper on the glass in advance to prevent broken glass from flying around due to bombs; however, due to the degree of power and location of the bomb, it will still fly around, so you should pay close attention to avoid danger.</p>
<p>Remove the paper doors in the house and place them in a place where they will not get in the way, or open them.</p>
<p>People who cannot engage in air defense activities should go to shelters and other safe places to hide.</p>
<p>Do not take out your property and appliances.</p>
<p>After completing all the actions of light control at night, the person responsible for air defense checks again; except for the protection and surveillance personnel, the air defense personnel should immediately go to the shelter to wait.</p>
<p>In Baojia: The head of the Baojia quickly conveys the alert. The head of the Baojia assigns protection and surveillance personnel. The head of the Baojia guards vacant houses and warehouses. The head of the Baojia checks the status of the Baojia and improves any incomplete areas.</p>
<p>Fourthly, After the Enemy Planes Arrive: The protection and surveillance personnel discover the enemy planes, or hear the sound of bombing and artillery fire, then go to the designated shelter to hide, pay attention to the situation afterwards, prepare for the next air raid, and take charge of protection surveillance. Upon receiving notification of protection and surveillance, other air defense personnel wait in the designated shelter. There may be continuous air raids, and air defense personnel must pay attention to this and not be negligent.</p>

<p>Family Matters</p>
<p>Air defense personnel swiftly take on fire prevention duties, loudly notifying neighbors.</p>
<p>Fire Prevention Methods:</p>
<p>(A) The first minute is the most critical.</p>
<p>(B) Regardless of the type of incendiary bomb, pour water on surrounding flammable materials to prevent the spread of fire. This is the first step.</p>
<p>(C) Handle different types and situations of incendiary bombs accordingly. Electronic incendiary bombs: Throw water-soaked straw mats at them, or pour water on them, or throw sandbags to suppress the fire. For incendiary bombs with weak flames, quickly scoop them away with a shovel. Grease incendiary bombs: Throw water-soaked straw mats at them, or pour water on them, or use buckets and aluminum shovels to throw sand and extinguish the grease fire.</p>
<p>White phosphorus bombs: Pour water on the congealed and burning white phosphorus, or pour water-soaked straw mats over it, or use buckets and iron shovels to throw sand to extinguish the flames, then scoop it away with an iron shovel. For scattered and burning white phosphorus, extinguish it with water-soaked sticks, or reduce it with water. Do not touch white phosphorus with your hands or feet.</p>
<p>(D) If an incendiary bomb lands on the ceiling or roof, use a hook or long pole to dislodge it.</p>
<p>(E) If an incendiary bomb lands in a place inconvenient for fire prevention, use a hook or long pole to move it elsewhere.</p>
<p>(F) For fire sources at high or distant places, use a water ladle to pour water over them.</p>
<p>(G) For fire embers and sparks, use a fire poker to extinguish them. White phosphorus can continue to burn for a long time, and even if extinguished, it can reignite, so move it away or to a safe place to let it burn. Stay vigilant for a long time where white phosphorus incendiary bombs land.</p>
<p>(H) Incendiary bombs may land anywhere in the house, so pay attention to closets, storerooms, ceilings, and under the floor.</p>
<p>Neighborhood Association Matters</p>
<p>If there are no unusual conditions in the air defense personnel's own homes, they should quickly go to their work locations and, under the command of the neighborhood association leader, dedicate all their efforts to fire prevention.</p>
<p>If there are no unusual conditions in the neighboring neighborhood association, leave a portion of the air defense personnel on guard and dispatch</p>
<p>If the neighborhood association leader reports no incendiary shapes in the neighborhood association, contact the nearest air defense team office or police fire station.</p>
<p>If the neighborhood association believes that its strength is insufficient for fire prevention, request assistance from the police fire team and fire department.</p>
<p>If the neighborhood association leader finds unexploded bombs in the neighborhood association, they must be careful not to touch them and quickly report them to the nearest police fire team office or police fire station.</p>
<p>After a fire starts</p>
<p>When a fire starts, before receiving orders from police fire officials and air defense team members, the neighborhood association leader shall always command air defense personnel to fight the fire and prevent its spread.</p>
<p>Firefighting methods:</p>
<p>(A) First, pour water on the places that are about to catch fire to prevent the fire from growing.</p>
<p>(B) Next, gradually extinguish the burning areas by pouring water on them from all sides.</p>
<p>Methods to prevent the spread of fire:</p>
<p>(A) When there are flames, pour water on them.</p>
<p>(B) When there is intense heat, pay attention to places that are prone to catching fire and pour water on them.</p>
<p>Preventing fires requires a large amount of water, so water must be constantly replenished.</p>
<p>If there is a risk of fire spreading in the neighboring neighborhood association, the neighboring neighborhood association leader shall dispatch air defense personnel to prevent the spread of fire. If there is no such danger, leave a portion of the air defense personnel on guard and send the rest to assist the neighboring neighborhood association.</p>
<p>After the fire department and police fire team arrive, listen to their commands and help fight the fire.</p>
<p>On the leeward side, be wary of sparks. Extinguish sparks with fire pokers or buckets and water ladles.</p>
<p>After bombs are dropped If you hear the sound of bombs falling, or if bombs land nearby, quickly lie down or hide in a nearby shelter to avoid immediate danger.</p>
<p>Bombs can also cause fires, so be careful.</p>
<p>If the neighborhood association leader finds bombs falling in the neighborhood association, report it to the nearest air defense team office or police fire station.</p>
<p>If the neighborhood association leader discovers an unexploded bomb, do not go near it. Quickly report it to the nearest air defense team office or police fire station and follow their instructions.</p>
<p>After poisonous gas bombs are dropped</p>
<p>If you smell poisonous gas or hear a poisonous gas alarm, those with gas masks should quickly put them on.</p>
<p>Those without gas masks should use simple absorbent canisters. If they don't even have simple absorbent canisters, cover their mouths and noses with wet towels and move to the windward side or a non-toxic zone at a right angle to the wind direction.</p>
<p>The neighborhood association leader should quickly report it to the nearest air defense team office or police fire station.</p>
<p>After deaths or injuries occur</p>
<p>Even if injured, do not be afraid.</p>
<p>First rescue the severely injured, then rescue the lightly injured. Quickly rescue people trapped under buildings.</p>
<p>If there are not enough people, report to the air defense team and police station for assistance.</p>
<p>Rescue methods:</p>
<p>1. Quickly send the severely injured to the rescue station.</p>
<p>(A) For those with excessive bleeding, apply emergency hemostasis before sending them.</p>
<p>(B) Handle broken bones with care.</p>
<p>(C) If it is necessary to send them to the rescue station within a short time, do not treat them. Send them immediately.</p>
<p>2. Provide emergency treatment to the lightly injured and continue their activities, or send them to the rescue station for treatment.</p>
<p>3. Quietly send those suffocating from poisonous gas to the rescue station. For those poisoned by blister agents, provide emergency detoxification before sending them to the rescue station. Those poisoned by tear gas and sneezing gas should administer emergency treatment themselves, or go to the rescue station for treatment.</p>
<p>Patients and their attendants admitted to the rescue station must follow the instructions of the rescue station staff. The deceased should be treated with respect and quickly accommodated.</p>
<p>After the air raid alert is lifted Restore the state when the warning alert was issued.</p>
<p>Prepare in advance for the next air raid.</p>
<p>The neighborhood association leader shall report the damage in the neighborhood association to the neighborhood head and the nearest police station.</p>
<p>The neighborhood association leader shall hand over shrapnel and other fallen objects to the police station.</p>
<p>Fifth General Understanding</p>
<p>The general public should have a special understanding of schools, factories, banks, companies, hospitals, theaters, gatherings, department stores, etc. This has the deepest relationship with family and neighborhood air defense. The details are listed below.</p>
<p>Students</p>
<p>Students should prepare for air defense on weekdays</p>
<p>Even if a warning alert has been issued, continuing classes is a prerequisite. School National Team's air defense assistant, as needed, is responsible for pre-assigned firefighting, rescue, and other air defense work.</p>
<p>If you hear an air raid alert at home, those assigned tasks by the school should immediately carry out their tasks. If you are on your way to or from school, those with tasks should quickly carry them out. The rest, whether at school or at home, must go to the nearest convenient location</p>
<p>Factory</p>
<p>Specially established defense team members, ready to issue air raid warnings at any time, should immediately rush to their workplaces.</p>
<p>After the air raid alert is issued, continuing to work hard to ensure that production does not decrease is a prerequisite.</p>
<p>The general industrial soldiers working in factories should go to their workplaces during office hours as usual after the air raid alert is issued.</p>
<p>Banks, Companies, etc.</p>
<p>When an air raid alert is issued, the general office work of employees should be carried out in accordance with the methods specified in the previous section.</p>
<p>Hospitals</p>
<p>After an air raid alert is issued, necessary surgeries and treatments should still be performed.</p>
<p>Patients living in hospitals used as rescue stations may be ordered to leave the hospital according to the air raid situation.</p>
<p>It is not allowed to inquire about the safety of patients living in the hospital by telephone or visit them in person during air raids.</p>
<p>Theaters, Gatherings, Department Stores, etc.</p>
<p>After a warning alert is issued, do not go to theaters or department stores. Except for those who have no other choice, do not go to gatherings. Lectures and other gatherings should not be held outdoors.</p>
<p>After an air raid alert is issued, all plays and gatherings must be stopped. When in these public places, you must follow the instructions of the staff.</p>
<p>If fire prevention materials are arranged in advance, and the location of emergency exits and shelters is known, you will not be at a loss when an air raid alert is issued at any time.</p>
<p>Sixth Other</p>
<p>The following matters should be kept in mind for air defense.</p>
<p>Pedestrians</p>
<p>After an air raid alert is issued, quickly run to your home or workplace.</p>
<p>After discovering enemy aircraft, or hearing bombing and artillery sounds:</p>
<p>(A) Go to the nearest shelter to hide. If there is no shelter nearby, use the terrain to lower your body. If there is no terrain to use, lie on the ground. When hiding, be sure to be divided, and do not rush to be first, causing chaos.</p>
<p>(B) If an incendiary bomb falls on a nearby house, you should cooperate in fire prevention.</p>

<h3>Review of Shanghai Swimming - Wen Jingling, Shen Xuanming, etc. are outstanding talents for men and women - We should overcome all difficulties and actively promote it in the future</h3>
<p>— Zhao An</p>
<p>Swimming talents have always been lacking in our country; Shanghai, as a busy commercial port, also feels the lack. Looking at the World Fair held in Berlin, only Chen Zhen and two others in our country could serve as swimming representatives; they failed to qualify in the preliminary round of the World Games, and their results were far behind. Also, in the previous Sixth National Games, Shanghai had many swimming representatives, but the top three places were taken by Guangdong, Hong Kong, Malaysia, etc. Shanghai only managed to rank fourth. From this, we can know a glimpse of the swimming world in our country in the past. Since the Incident, swimming competitions in Shanghai have almost been completely suspended, and most swimmers have dispersed. The swimming pools have also been closed one after another, causing panic in Shanghai's swimming talents. Recently, the Shanghai Sports Federation and the Shanghai YMCA Sports Department jointly organized the National Open Chinese Swimming Competition, which contains the intention of reviving water sports; this article will only make a brief review of this scope in order to attract attention from all parties, and to provide a reference for those who practice swimming.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Lack of Talents</p>
<p>The reasons for the lack of swimming talents in Shanghai can be summarized into the following five points: Although some people advocate swimming, there is a lack of powerful and planned promotion, so it does not achieve great results. Due to weather conditions, swimming is only possible in summer, and only limited to July and August. The rest of the time is too cold and not suitable for water sports. There are too few swimming pools, and even fewer now; as for beach swimming, except for the former Jiaohui Bathing Beach, there is no other place. Our Chinese people's physique, perhaps due to environmental reasons or poor health care, is mostly weak, which has a great impact on swimming performance. Although there are swimmers among the Chinese people, most of them lack basic technical training; there are many people with many years of swimming experience but no good results.</p>
<p>Swimming Results This Year</p>
<p>For this reason, the National Open Chinese Swimming Competition this time is full of the above phenomena. The number of participants in this competition is 104 for men and only 14 for women, including those who escaped at the last minute. Comparing this number with the four million population of Shanghai, it is indeed insignificant. And upon careful examination, the skills of this group of swimmers are generally immature. Most of them have not been trained. For example, starting, swimming, breathing, turning, full stroke swimming, and the use and distribution of strength, etc., are mostly immature. Among them, a considerable number stop due to exhaustion halfway. Only a very small number can be satisfied; this shows the low general swimming level in this city.</p>
<p>Exploration of Personal Skills</p>
<p>As for personal skills, we can seek the following three criteria to study whether a swimmer has achievements: First</p>
<p>(From left to right) Ms. Shen Xuanming, Ms. Liu Tianyu, and Ms. Cheng Jinqian, who are now the most outstanding female swimmers in Shanghai, had good results in the National Open Swimming Competition on September 6.</p>
<p>Female Heroes on the Water</p>
<p>See if their body structure is tall, their muscles are light and full, their joints are flexible, their lung capacity is wide, and their strength is sufficient. Second, measure whether their breath holding time is long, whether their body can float high on the water, and if they use strength, whether their speed can be faster than others. Third, observe whether their starting, swimming posture, breathing, turning, and use of strength skills are correct and well-trained. Based on the above three standards, there can be no errors in examining the technical skills of each swimmer. In this competition, Wen Jingling, the gold medalist in the men's group, meets all the standards except that his body is not tall enough and his muscles are a bit stiff. His turning technique is particularly outstanding, similar to the method used by American Miller, the world record holder in the 100-meter freestyle. The use of strength during the swim is also well-regulated. For every lap he swims, the number of arm strokes is ten times for 100 yards, and eleven or twelve times for 400 yards and 800 yards. The breathing frequency for each stroke is also very rhythmic, which can be described as an old swimmer. Wang Zhongcheng is good at backstroke, and his bone structure is suitable. If he can make his body slightly stronger and his strength is sufficient, his achievements should improve smoothly. The figure of male swimmer Wei Shou is most suitable for the standard, and his strength is very great. However, he has been neglecting practice recently, and his turning technique and endurance have declined. Otherwise, it would not be Wang Zhongcheng who dominated the backstroke this time. Lu Hui's body is short and small, and his strength is insufficient. However, he is extremely diligent in training, and his freestyle and stroke are quite experienced; his shortcoming is that his emotions are unstable, he is easily irritable, and he cannot concentrate on the competition, which is the reason for his defeat. Bai Weili's body is thin and long, and his speed is quite fast, but his turning is not effective. This is his biggest shortcoming. Otherwise, he can compete with Tang Kaoling in the 100-200 yard freestyle. As for breaststroke, the most important thing is the legs; Chen Zuizhong is indeed a promising talent, but his legs are too short and his endurance is not strong. Cao Yu, who started breaststroke later, has a figure that fits the standard very well, but his experience is not rich enough. With hard work in practice in the future, he will definitely become a famous breaststroker. In the women's group, Shen Xuanming has the best floating body and the most strength in this competition. Her freestyle is better than backstroke, which has the same problem as Chen Zhongnan, a competitor in the National Games, that is, the leg kick is not lively enough. If she can correct this point, she will be very promising in the future. Cheng Jinqian is the person with the most suitable figure for women. Her freestyle posture is very good. Except for the need to study more on starting, turning, and focusing strength, she can be said to be without flaws. Liu Tianyu's breaststroke is more successful than freestyle. This time, her freestyle competition results are not bad. If she can increase the strength of her arms and make her legs kick more lively, her results will definitely improve. Zheng Xiuzhen's backstroke posture can be regarded as first-class, but her figure is small and her strength is insufficient. If she can be properly trained, she can make a breakthrough.</p>
<p>(Due to space constraints, the review of other swimmers is omitted.)</p>
<h3>Ballpark Anecdotes</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In this Baoshuan Cup Mongolian ball competition, there are several teams that are still promising to compete for hegemony, such as Tongren, Huayu, and Shantou teams. Old teams either withdrew midway or were incomplete. Some people thought that there would be no good games to watch, but that is not the case. To be honest, now a few basketball teams of veterans, except for Li Yizhong who is still improving, do not have many exciting performances. It is better to let Changlu, Ahzai, and Xianglong retire. On the contrary, the Xuanjia class and the Liu family’s generals are fighting seriously and vividly. It seems too much.</p>
<p>If fans savor my words carefully, they should know that what I said is not false.</p>
<p>Qian Xucang is a promising youth sports figure. He has been training for several years and can always train a team with considerable achievements. Yingben was originally a second-rate character, but today he is suddenly mixed into a first-rate team. It is not too colorful. Mr. Yu's hard work in guidance cannot be ignored. I also heard that the Ying female basketball team has also hired Mr. Yu for guidance. If Mr. Qian trains the women's team less, in the future, a group of actresses will be active in the stadium to see what the style of guidance is and lead them.</p>
<p>In the Suhuai football team's battle against Donghua, I think the biggest shortcoming is that they cannot make use of Wang Shishan and Li Yiben. It is biased to play Li Wei. Don't you see the old qualifications of Li Qing? It is difficult for Guan Renkuan and Wang Shishan to pass easily, which leads to abandonment midway. If there are a few more passes to allow Wang Shishan and Li Yiben to go up a few times, Li Qing will definitely not be able to bear it. At that time, Wang Guan would be able to get more opportunities with ease. Therefore, the ball should always use new tactics in the morning to not lose the talent of the top.</p>
<p>The strange foot Pang Wen returned to Shenjiang, but he has never seen him make a strange move, which is quite disappointing. According to A-Shi, his health has been poor recently, which is not to be blamed. However, I personally hope that can know how to take care of himself in order to live up to the expectations of the fans.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Recollections: Scraps and Fragments</h3>
<p>— Zhou Fohai</p>
<p>This year in June, I went to Wuhan for an inspection. As with going to other places, it stirred up many new and old memories. On an autumnal rainy night by the window, I traced past events and especially extracted whatever I could recall, preserving it as a memento for future days.</p>
<p>Planning lies with man, but success is with Heaven. Even a small matter cannot be realized according to one's wishful calculations. My plan was to inspect Wuhan first, then go to Guangzhou. Therefore, I intended to fly to Wuhan on May 27th. Who knew the weather would be exceptionally bad that day, making flying impossible? On the 28th, the weather in Nanjing seemed slightly better, and I thought I could depart, but the weather report said the weather along the route was unfavorable and absolutely not feasible. I had to postpone it again to the 29th. Who knew the weather would be even worse that day? Because I had pre-scheduled matters to attend to in Nanjing after the 20th and couldn't leave the capital, my trip to Wuhan had to be temporarily abandoned. It wasn't until after returning from Guangzhou on June 28th that the plane achieved the purpose of inspecting Wuhan. Originally, I wanted to go to Wuhan first, then Guangzhou, but Heaven arranged for me to go to Guangzhou first, then Wuhan. How can worldly affairs be dictated by man?</p>
<p>On the 28th, the air pressure was very low, also not good flying weather. Because I couldn't postpone it any further, I insisted on taking the risk and flying. Along the way, due to heavy fog, we flew very low. The fields, chickens, and dogs were all clearly visible. Therefore, the shape of the Yangtze River and the grandeur of the Dabie Mountains could be carefully observed. Xiaogushan, where "ten thousand soldiers can be hidden, and Penglang snatches the maiden back," and Chibi, where "the mountain is high, the moon is small, and the water recedes, revealing the rocks," were all seen from afar in the sky. This reminded me of the various historical events along the Yangtze River throughout history, and I couldn't help but feel, "The rolling Yangtze River flows eastward, the waves wash away heroes, and right and wrong, success and failure, turn into emptiness." Lost in reflecting on the past and lamenting the present, unknowingly, the two-and-a-half-hour flight quickly came to an end.</p>
<p>After getting off the plane, Chinese and Japanese officials came to welcome me, and I was inevitably caught up in a flurry of greetings and busyness. Then, I got into a car to the provincial government guesthouse in Yihe Village.</p>
<p>Besides Nanjing and Shanghai, the places where I had worked before were Wuhan and Guangzhou, and I visited Wuhan more frequently. Therefore, my impression of Wuhan was deeper, and there were many things worth reminiscing about.</p>
<p>Soon After Going North, I Revisited Wuhan</p>
<p>The situation after the Northern Expeditionary Army reached Wuhan in the 15th year of the Republic has already been described in my article "Having Seen Prosperity and Decline, I Speak of the Vicissitudes of Life." After leaving Wuhan in the 16th year, the Northern Expeditionary Army reached Beijing in the 17th year. When I went north in July, I revisited Wuhan. We took a military ship from Nanjing to Hankou and then took the Pinghan Railway to Beijing. At that time, Wuhan was under the influence of the Gui clique. Li Zongren held a banquet for us at the Public Assembly Hall in the evening. Two things deeply moved me at the time. First, while we were downstairs, with a room full of dignitaries, enjoying a grand banquet, Cheng Songqiao was being held under house arrest in a small, unclean room on the third floor. Originally, after Li Zongren drove Tang Mengxiao away, he organized the Wuhan Political Branch and appointed Cheng as chairman to oppose Nanjing. Later, he imprisoned Cheng again, and coincidentally, we were being welcomed downstairs in the very place where he was imprisoned. The people from Nanjing were honored guests, while Cheng Songyun, who was used to resist Nanjing, had become a prisoner in a room. How could one not feel emotional about the ups and downs of politics and the coldness of human relationships! At that time, I imagined Cheng Songqiao sitting alone in a small room, hearing the cheerful military music and laughter downstairs, and how bitter and desolate he must have felt! Second, during the banquet, someone suddenly asked everyone for their calligraphy. At that time, I was sitting to Mr. Chiang's right, secretly wondering what words he would write. He held the brush and pondered for a moment, then wrote the four characters "Man Can Conquer Heaven." Because there was already a very large rift between Chiang and Gui at that time, we knew they would eventually resort to arms. The words he wrote had a deep meaning. Sure enough, the following year, I followed the Western Expeditionary Army back to Wuhan.</p>
<p>During this Western Expedition, both Yang Changqing and I helped the army in a personal capacity, without any official titles or specific tasks. Therefore, after arriving in Hankou, Changqing and I lived in the Shi'an General Association, a club organized by Guangdong merchants. We would go to the General Headquarters when summoned, and the rest of the time was free, making us feel very relaxed and at ease. I felt that this semi-staff, semi-guest status was not only very easy but also allowed us to move up and down freely. We could meet anyone, and anyone could meet us, without being bound by status or position. Although we had no specific responsibilities or powers, we were respected everywhere. Every day, we visited and chatted with relatives, friends, and acquaintances, enjoying the blessings of leisure amidst the chaos of war. Who knew that in less than half a month, I would be ordered to take over as Director of the Political Department of the General Headquarters. The director at that time was Fang Ziju, because he was transferred to be the Civil Affairs Director of Hubei Province, and I was temporarily drafted to fill the emergency. At that time, I had no assistants and no preparations, and I was truly overwhelmed. Coincidentally, Luo Junqiang, the current Minister of Justice, also arrived in Hankou with a certain division commander, so I asked him to be the chief secretary. We cobbled together an organization and went to take over the department. The General Political Department was located in the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company. When the Northern Expeditionary Army first arrived in Hankou in the 15th year, the General Political Department was also located here. It seemed that the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company in Hankou had an inextricable connection with the General Political Department. After taking office, I was busy for a while, and just as I finished the arrangements, I received an order to return to court. Therefore, I had another connection with Wuhan.</p>
<p>After that, I went to Wuhan two or three times, for example, during the first campaign against encirclement and suppression and the campaign against encirclement and suppression in Hunan and Hubei, but I only stayed for three or four days each time, so there was nothing to describe.</p>
<p>In the 26th year, after the government moved westward, I worked in Wuhan for almost a year. During this period, there were many unforgettable experiences.</p>
<p>When the Government Moved Westward, I Thought I Was Retreating to Jiangbei, But Destiny Determined I Retreat to Wuhan.</p>
<p>After the 20th year of the Republic, I served as a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and concurrently as the Director of Education. In the spring of the 25th year, Gong Chuan resigned as the Chairman of the Central Mass Training Committee. The political group became the Mass Training Department, and I was elected as the Minister, still concurrently handling the war affairs of Jiangsu. Every day, I traveled between Nanjing and Zhenjiang. In the spring of the 26th year, I was ordered to merge the Mass Training Department back with Gongbo and focus on Jiangsu affairs. Therefore, I should have retreated to Yangzhou with the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Who knew that after the incident occurred, the General Headquarters was established, with the Second Department in charge of political strategy. Xiong Tianyi was the Minister, and I was appointed as the Deputy Minister. Later, because the Secretariat was busy, Chen Buwei, who was the Chief Secretary, felt he couldn't handle it, and I was ordered to also serve concurrently as the Deputy Chief Secretary of the Secretariat. Later, the Jiangsu Provincial Government was reorganized, with Gu Mosan and Chen Zhifu as chairmen. The changes were quite amusing, but I remained in my position. When the government moved westward, I felt that although the situation in Jiangsu was small, I was in charge, while the affairs of the central government, although important, made me merely a deputy. Therefore, my own opinion was to move to Jiangbei with the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Who knew that after the decree was issued, I was ordered to move west with the Military Affairs Commission? Thus, I went to Wuhan again.</p>
<p>Retreating from Nanjing to Hankou</p>
<p>The situation of leaving the capital four times can also be mentioned at this opportunity. Nanjing was very tense. The last few ships were about to depart within a few days, and I had been designated to leave on one of these ships. Suddenly, a hurried phone call came from Hankou. It was Shuhui calling. She had arrived in Hankou from Changsha and was going to take a boat to Nanjing the next day. She had sent the children back to Hunan at the beginning of the incident. At that time, I always felt that the incident would not escalate, because, based on the situation between China and Japan at that time, I believed it would end after a certain period. Later, I met many Japanese friends who were in charge at the time, and they also said that the Japanese authorities had no pre-determined plan to escalate it at that time. Therefore, my observation at that time was not wrong. At that time, the unexpected expansion and prolongation of the situation to the present was not a tragic fate? It is inconvenient to discuss these political arguments here. At that time, I was convinced that it would not escalate, so although I saw many people moving, I did not approve of it. However, Shuhui acted independently and prepared to return to Hunan on a large scale. Originally, Shuhui and I had divided our territories. She never asked about my external political affairs, and I never interfered with domestic matters. Therefore, I could not prevent her from sending the children back to Hunan. However, I secretly smiled in my belly, laughing at her for being busy moving back to Hunan. Soon she would be busy moving back to Nanjing. It was truly like eating without having anything to do, wanting to be busy for nothing. Who knew that the situation would evolve in this way? If she had not "insisted on her own way" and moved back to Hunan first, I don't know what tragedy would have occurred. Thinking about it now, I am truly grateful for her decisiveness.</p>
<p>At that time, receiving her call made me feel truly dilemma. Let her come? If she had not arrived and I had already retreated, what should I do? Not let her come? She had already obtained a ship berth with great difficulty, and the ship was going to set sail tomorrow morning. In the end, I decided to leave it to fate and simply let her come. She only stayed in Nanjing for three days, and I was preparing to retreat. Shuhui came with Ms. Wu Shiting. Arranging ship berths for them in the chaotic and crowded situation at that time was not an easy task. Just as I was at a loss, around six or seven in the afternoon, Xiong Tianyi suddenly said, "I got a cabin berth, but you have to board the ship tonight." Thus, on a dark, rainy night, I sent them to the ship. Then I could relax. The next afternoon, I also boarded the ship. He Jingzhi and others were all on this ship. At that time, Zhang Wenbai had just been appointed as the chairman of Hunan Province, so I shared a room with him. Because I was too tired, I fell asleep soon after nightfall. It was truly "unaware of being a guest in a dream." When I woke up, I saw that it was not my usual bedroom at home, which I found quite strange. After thinking about it carefully, I realized that I had already left the capital and left home! When would I return to the capital? When would I return home? I couldn't help but feel a sense of loss.</p>
<p>Going Back and Forth Between Changsha and Hankou</p>
<p>After arriving in Hankou, I found Shuhui. We stayed in Hankou for four or five days, during which it was chaotic and indescribable. In the midst of war and chaos, there was no work to be done. Coincidentally, Wenbai was going to Hunan to take office and invited me to go to Changsha with him. I took this opportunity to go to Changsha, which I had not seen for ten years, with Shuhui, Junqiang, and Shiting in Wenbai's private car.</p>
<p>After a period of busyness, I took time out to visit Mount Yuelu. It had been twenty-four years since I visited Mount Yuelu in the second year of the Republic. Now, revisiting the old place, it was like a traveler returning home after wandering around the world. Thinking back to the past twenty-four years, time had truly flown by like a white horse flashing past a crack. I often read in notebooks that wealth and glory are just a dream of Yellow Millet. At this time, I truly experienced that feeling. In the past twenty-four years, I don't know how much misfortune and hardship, vicissitudes and illusions I had experienced. Looking back now, weren't they all just a dream! Was there any difference between me visiting the mountains now and me visiting the mountains twenty-four years ago? Wasn't it like falling asleep suddenly when I entered the mountains twenty-four years ago and waking up now? Thinking about it like this at the time, I truly felt like abandoning the mortal world and becoming a monk immediately!</p>
<p>After staying in Changsha for a week, when Tao Deman was mediating peace, I received a telegram from Hankou. Suddenly, my mortal heart moved greatly again, and I re-entered the mundane world, leaving my wife and children and going to Wuhan again.</p>
<p>I stayed at Fan Shaogai's house in Hankou. Shaogai and I parted ways in Chongqing, and he passed away soon after. Now his tomb must be covered with trees. Recalling the old friend, I can't help but feel sad! At that time, although Tao Deman's mediation did not succeed, various departments and personnel had gradually gathered, and work began. After the Temporary National Congress was held, the Central Plenary Session was held. Gu Mengyu was elected as the Minister of Propaganda, and I was elected as the Deputy Minister of Propaganda. At that time, Gu was in Hong Kong, and it was clear that he would not come. So I was asked to be the Acting Minister. After that, all thoughts, speeches, and activities were related to politics and did not fit the nature of this journal (Ancient and Modern), so I will wait for another opportunity to talk about them.</p>
<p>Soon after, Shuhui also came with two children, and everyone lived in Shaogai's house. We felt that the children could not wander with us and that we had to find a fixed place to settle down. We discussed it for a long time and could not find a suitable place. I suddenly remembered that in Nanjing, everyone was moving, with those in the south of the city moving to the north and those in the north moving to the south, and no one knew where it was safe. One day, Buwei suddenly asked Mr. Chiang in a silly way, "Where is the safest place to move to?" He replied, "Hong Kong." Unexpectedly, Hong Kong would also be shelled, bombed, and would have to move and suffer hardships. The changing international relations were unpredictable. At that time, I thought of this sentence and advocated for Hong Kong. Shuhui was initially unwilling, but later agreed. On the day of departure, I sent them, mother and three children, across the river to the Nanhukou Airport in Wuchang. Parting is a painful thing, and parting in times of chaos, with no hope of reunion, is especially painful. At that time, the feelings of parents and children saying goodbye were beyond what the four words "sad and soul-stirring" could describe. Watching their plane depart, I crossed the river back to Hankou with a sense of loss. At that time, there were no reliable friends in Hong Kong. I am still grateful and admired that Shuhui could take her children to a place where they were not familiar with the language and customs. Coincidentally, Hu Bijiang was in Hong Kong and took great care of them and invited them to live in his home. I will never forget the friendship of my good friend. Unfortunately, Bijiang died in a plane crash and is now also gone. Recalling old friends, how can I express my sorrow!</p>
<p>At that time, I was very depressed. In the evenings, I either chatted with Tang Zhimin or went to Shao Yan's house to relax. At that time, the important people in Wuhan, such as He Xuechu, Chen Yunxuan, Ye Beibei, Yang Kuiyi, and Fan Shaogai, almost went to Shao Yan's house every night. We talked about everything from the beginning of the universe to the present, from the North Pole to the South Pole, venting the day's fatigue and mental depression in casual conversations. Finally, we ate a rich supper and went home. Of the people who gathered at that time, only two or three still meet often. In addition, some are living apart, and some are dead. "Great gatherings do not last, and great feasts do not happen again." This is true in normal times, let alone in wartime. Now, I pray every day for the friends who are living apart. Soon, old friends will reunite and have another great gathering.</p>
<p>Because it was inconvenient for me to stay at Shaogai's house for a long time, I planned to find another house. At this time, Shuhui had settled down in Hong Kong and had taken the old lady Yang and Ms. Wu Shiting from Hunan to Hong Kong to take care of the children, and then flew to Hankou again. At this time, Shaogai suddenly wrote an elegy for his deceased wife, so we rented an independent house in the French Concession and moved out to live there. At that time, the Secretariat was in Wuchang. The Propaganda Department was originally in Wuchang, but later moved to Hankou, and I traveled back and forth between Wuchang and Hankou every day, and the days passed easily. Later, the war situation became more and more tense, and we could no longer live in Hankou, so I sent her to Hong Kong again by plane. At that time, because the news was uncertain, the separation was even more heartbreaking than the previous one. Because even though it was a separation in life, in the midst of war, it was uncertain whether it would be a separation in death. After Shuhui left, Zhimin also went to Hong Kong, and the gatherings at Shao Yan's house gradually declined, with only Xuechu and two or three others left. The situation was desolate, giving people a feeling of a lonely city and a setting sun! Soon, I also followed the Propaganda Department and flew to Chongqing.</p>
<p>On the Eve of the Fall of Wuhan</p>
<p>Less than a month after arriving in Chongqing, I was summoned back to Hankou and first stayed at Yunzhu's house, then at the guesthouse of the Bank of Communications on Liangyi Street, which was where Zhimin used to live. At this time, Shao Yan also moved his whole family to Hong Kong. Our night gatherings had moved to the guesthouse of the Bank of Communications, and the people who attended were even fewer. Only Yunzhu, who was a standing committee member, came every night. I stayed in Hankou for another three weeks. At that time, the Secretariat had also moved to Hankou with the war, so there was no need to cross the river. I only worked in Hankou. During those three weeks, the situation became more dangerous day by day, and the news became more urgent day by day. Even rickshaws could not be seen on the streets. As soon as it got dark, every house closed its doors. The entire Wuhan Tri-Cities became three dead cities. The tragic, severe, and bleak wartime scene was truly shocking. On the night before the fall of Hankou, I was ordered to fly to Chongqing, while Buwei was ordered to fly to Hengshan immediately. At dusk, I went to Buwei's place to say goodbye. Since that farewell, we have not been able to meet again. Among my friends, Buwei and I had the most compatible personalities and deep friendship. Now that we are in the north and south, although we hope to meet, the clouds are distant, and the trees are far away. How can I express my sorrow? I can't help but feel sad. At midnight, after shaking hands with Yunzhu, I went to the airport and said goodbye to Hankou in the dark night, flying to Chengdu. (Because Chongqing did not have night navigation facilities at that time.)</p>
<p>Past Events Stir Emotions</p>
<p>This time, going to Wuhan brought back all the past events to my mind, one scene after another, making people feel melancholy and sad. From the airport to Yihe Village, we could have avoided passing by the riverside, but because of martial law, we had to take the road along the river, so we passed by the old Central Bank, reminding me of attending the Supreme National Defense Conference here every week in the 27th year of the Republic. We passed by Mr. Wang's residence, reminding me of often visiting this place to ask for instructions and discuss the situation. Entering the old French Concession, seeing Shao Yan's old house on Fuxing Road, the house was still there, but Shaogai was gone, and he had already passed away. I deeply felt the impermanence of life. Seeing Shao Yan's old house again reminded me of the friends who gathered there in the past, who were now scattered like clouds, each in a different place, and I couldn't help but feel lonely. In short, there were too many places that stirred emotions. How could I describe them all?</p>
<p>I gave simple speeches during the inspection of the Wuhan Finance Commissioner's Office, the Central Bank's Hankou Branch, and the Hankou Special City Government. These were all places I had visited often before. For example, the current City Government was where Mr. Wang's office was in the 27th year of the Republic, and I often saw him there.</p>
<p>The next day, I crossed the river to Wuchang and Hankou. This was my first time in Wuchang since the incident, although I had visited once in the year of the return to the capital. During my time in Wuhan in the 27th year of the Republic, I went to Wuchang almost every day. Although I was busy and tired, I often enjoyed crossing the river, because I always sat in a private boat, without any noise or crowding. Enjoying the vast expanse of misty water and the scenery of the setting sun and sailing boats made me feel refreshed. Especially when sailing downwind, standing at the bow of the boat, I felt like I had the ambition to ride the long wind and break through thousands of miles of waves. This time, crossing the river, I felt that the scenery was still the same, and the heroic ambition to ride the wind and waves seemed to be no less than before. I inspected the Provincial Government and convened the Xingying, the Provincial Party Headquarters, and various military and political cadres for a brief speech. Governor Yang Kuiyi invited me to visit Mount Luojia. When passing by the Yue Ma Chang, the scene of the mass meeting held here during the Northern Expedition in the 16th year of the Republic was still vivid in my mind. But now the "field" was long gone and had become a simple park. When I arrived at Wuhan University, I saw that the towering buildings had not been destroyed, and I felt relieved. Unfortunately, the sound of reading had long ceased, and I could no longer hear it today. The Temporary National Congress of the 26th year of the Republic was held here. At that time, to avoid air raids, the meetings were held at night, and there were no lights on the roads. Buwei and I shared a car and groped our way forward in the dark, causing much laughter. This scene was as if it were yesterday.</p>
<p>We entered the city from Mount Luojia, climbed Snake Mountain, and walked to the Yellow Crane Tower. The tower had collapsed, and the scene was desolate. It no longer had its former glory. The trees of Hanyang and the fragrant grass of Parrot Isle could no longer be seen, but the majestic shape of the Yangtze River was still the same as it had been for thousands of years. Looking out from a high place, I felt refreshed.</p>
<p>The weather was extremely hot. In the evening, there was a public banquet hosted by Mayor Zhang Fanqing. I was worried about the heat, but he had a wonderful idea. The banquet was set in Zhongshan Park. I was very happy to hear that. Zhongshan Park was even larger than Zhaofeng Park in Shanghai. It had been very well arranged before the incident, and I often came here to relax when I was tired from work. After the incident, the City Government expanded and enriched it, making it even more lush with trees and plants than before. Walking through it, the mundane world was swept away. But what spoiled the scenery was that there were no tourists wherever we went. Because a large number of armed police officers were clearing the way in front and behind, and without waiting for the police to order, the tourists had already avoided us. I thought to myself: If we are so detached from the masses and isolated from society, it is not only not a good way politically, but also what joy is there in life? However, the authorities in charge had the responsibility of being careful, and there was nothing we could do about it.</p>
<p>Inspecting Zhang Gong Dyke for a Week</p>
<p>What I was most concerned about was the flood, so I asked Mayor Zhang to inspect Zhang Gong Dyke for a week. The scenery along the way was very good, but if Zhang Gong Dyke was not prepared in peacetime, it would not be easy to "rescue" it when the flood came. Because during the flood, there would be springs inside and outside the dike. How could a long earth dike in the middle of the water withstand strong winds and waves! Moreover, if we needed earth for rescue, where could we dig earth from a long dike? Fortunately, the Municipal Public Works Bureau had built earth platforms along the dike and prepared a lot of earth for emergency use. Since the return to the capital, I have been worried about floods and droughts every year. Because in the aftermath of war and chaos, if there were to be another flood or drought, the people would truly have no way to live. In the summer before last, it had not rained for a long time, and I would look at the weather every morning and evening. If it was a clear and cloudless day, I would worry, and if it was cloudy and drizzling, I would feel happy. One night, I sent Lieutenant General Ying Zuo to the door. He saluted me and said goodbye, but I was looking at the sky and did not see him. He asked me what I was looking at, and I told him that I was looking to see if there was any hope of rain tonight. He complimented me by saying, "This is truly a sign of good governance." In fact, a person's mentality changes with their position and responsibility. If I had not been responsible for finance, I would not have been so concerned about floods and droughts, although I could not say that I would be completely indifferent. Therefore, I remembered another proverb, which is "Say the words of your position, and strike the bell for the day you are a monk." Some people criticize these two sentences, saying that they show that the Chinese only know how to get by and have no long-term plans. But I don't think so. It would be great if everyone could practice these two sentences. Because the first sentence means that you have to adapt to your position, that is, if you are a teacher, you have to say the words of a teacher, and if you are an official, you have to say the words of an official. The second sentence means that you have to be responsible. We are only afraid that people in certain positions will not say the words of their position, that teachers will talk about doing business, and that officials will only cater to others. We are also afraid that monks will not strike the bell. Therefore, a person must know their position, understand their responsibilities, and fulfill the responsibilities they should bear in their position!</p>
<p>In the morning, I met with people from various fields to inquire about the current situation in Wuhan. Wuhan, with the Yangtze River in the east and west and the Pinghan Railway in the north and south, stood at the hub of transportation, with all directions connected, and was a place where goods from all over the world gathered and were distributed. Now the situation was completely different. In this situation, how could we blame the lack of resources and the people's haggard lives? We must not let this situation continue!</p>
<p>At one o'clock in the afternoon, in clear weather, I flew away from Hankou. Compared to flying away from Wuhan at night in October of the 27th year of the Republic, my mood was different.</p>
