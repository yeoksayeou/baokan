<p>社評</p>
<h3>新生上海之建設與民意機關</h3>
<p>上海公共租界已定於八月一日正式交還，上海法租界之同時交還似乎不應遲延，繼治外法權撤廢之後，國內租界亦已全部收回，我國百年來的屈辱史至此宣告終結，我國最近五十餘年以來革命救國運動所要求實現的最主要的目標已經實現，國民黨先總理孫中山先生奔走四十餘年所爭求的「中在國之自由平等」，「廢除不平等條約」已經逐漸實現了。因此，我們中國人民，一方面感激友邦日本給我們的援助，使我們逐漸走上獨立自主的大道，另一方面，我們不能不認淸責任之加重而深具戒愼之心。</p>
<p>我們在今天，必須向全國同胞指出，治外法權撇廢之後，上海租界繼又收回，雖然是國府三年餘以來外交政策的成果，但是，更切實的說，還是友邦日本實行對華新政策的具體表現。此次，日本對我的協助，實含有重大的意義，由前者言，最近數十年來，中日兩國關係之不正常的發展，雙方民間的誤會甚深，特別是事變以來，中國人民對於日本政策之誤解允甚，視友邦一切友善的對華政策，純爲「謀略」的表現，這種民間心理，近年來仍未完全消泯，實爲阻止中日全面和平之主要的根源。現在，從撤廢治外法權到交還租界，已經充分表現友邦對華政策之誠意。山後者言，東亞各國，都在注視着，繼續日本這種友善的表示之後，中國怎樣表現自己確實的能力？因此，我們要提醒全國，我們不要爲片面的現象而在歡，現在應該是我們起來表現的時候了！</p>
<p>我們能不能表現得好，無愧於友邦的期待，首先就要看我們怎樣治理交還後的上海。因爲，上海，無論在政治上，經濟上，文化上，以至遠東關係上，在中國始終居於中心的重要地位；而在歷史上，上海又是最富於英美侵略色彩的地方，當此英美勢力已經消滅的時候，我們能够把它建設得好，對內則可以推動全中國政治經濟文化的進步，成爲建設新中國的模範；對外更可以在全東亞面前表現，中華民族具有獨立自主建設新中國的能力，中華民族具有與友邦密切協力建設新東亞的能力，並且也可證明中日兩大民族親密合作的後果，可爲世界新秩序的典範。</p>
<p>建設新生上海，深信賢明的當局，一定早有完善的政策綱領。我們認爲特別重要，而且必須早作準備，俾能迅速實現的，就是樹立新生上海的眞正民意機關，以便協助政府。這個民意機關，我們認爲一定要具備以下幾個基本木條件：第一，在職權方面，必須明確規定，對於一切市政設施，具有協助政府調查。設計，向政府提供意見，以及對於特殊有關民生事業與設施之監督的權力。我們諷爲只有建立賦予此種權力的民意機關，才能爲政府的耳目，爲民衆的喉舌，使政府的施業爲民衆所擁護，使民衆的疾苦與要求爲政府所了解，因此才能切實集中官民一切力量，共同担負新生上海的建設事業，否則，政府與民衆脫節，任何建設就無從談起。第二，在組織方面，必須嚴密而靈活，不一定要有龐大的形式與機構，但是必須要便於執行其工作及發揮其效能。同時，爲了實現這種要求，這個民意機關的本身組織也必須力避官僚主義與衙門化，從上至下，精細分工，親密合作。第三，在人選方面，尤須愼重，一定要從眞正的市民中推選出可以代表民衆，而且爲民衆所信任敬愛的領袖與專門人材。</p>
<p>新生上海之建設前途，對於中日全面和平與全面協力，對於大東亞戰爭與大東亞新秩序，都有決定的意義，而這種建設的成敗，一方面固然要看政府今後的政策綱領及其執行情形而定，另一方面却有待於民意機關之創立及其實際的努力。我們竭誠期待政府對此加以最大的注意，研究與準備，我們更盼望社會領導份子與與論界共同研討以促其成。願市政府當局與各界領袖着眼於遠者大者，在這去舊佈新的時候，做出些一新國人耳目的大事業來！爲着上海，爲着中國，爲着東亞的前途，我們竭誠地期待着！</p>

<h3>時論選譯　交還上海公共租界</h3>
<p>上海公共租界的處理問題，自谷大使返任後，迅速地展開，當地大使館及陸海軍方面的意見已趨一致，目前正在向中央請示中。交還公共租界不久即可實現。根　一月九日與國府參戰同時締結的關於交還租界並撤廢治外法權的中日協定，專管租界，北京公使館區域，並厦門　浪　公共租界的交還，業已於三月三十日實行，又法國亦已交還其三處專管租界，所剩的上海專管租界亦凖備與公共租界同時交還。而在最後，英美在過去一世紀來制覇中國的牙域之上海公共租界，亦將出於日方善意而可收囘。於是中國獲得了完全的自主獨立，解除了所有的不平等條約的束縛。洵堪爲中國慶賀，同時，大東亞的建設，也更進了一步。</p>
<p>不用說，大東亞戰前的上海，是英美擁護在華權曾任的牙城，同時，亦爲在華權益的積集地。在他們對華投資中的銀行業，輸出入業，及商業，集中於上海的約有八成，工業，不動產投資約有七成。英美如何據此牙城以榨取中國，策動東亞的騷亂，計劃離間中日，不遑詳述。即使其他一切租界交還，但上海則不惜任何以維持至最後，其原因實即在此。租界接收後，向由英美獨占的行政機關工部局，勢必同時取消，新設以中國人爲長的上海特別市政府管轄的區公所，上海特別市府將爲上海最高的行政官廳。上海占中國對外貿易的人半，並占中國生產力的大半，在中國經濟上實占中樞的地位。而且向來完全是處於英美殖民地的地位。新上海現在掃除英美的色彩，在東亞的性質下，重新發　。中國方面對於建設新上海的責任，極爲重大。（翔：譯自六月廿七日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<p>各國在華租界全部收回</p>
<p>上海的公共租界，快由國府收囘了，上海法租界亦將交還。百年來束縛中國的主權，妨害獨立完整的全部各國在華租界，遂告消滅。</p>
<p>北京政府曾在巴黎和平會議正式提出收囘租界並恢復其他國權的要求，在二十五年後，中國完全達到其目的。</p>
<p>一月九日國府參戰以前，中國方面用自力收囘的租界，計有漢口·鎮江·九江·厦門四地的十處租界。剩下的還有專管租界十六處，及公共租界二處。然則中日二國向完遂大東亞戰爭的共同戰綫態勢，因國府的參戰而愈見鞏固。日本對華新政策之迅速的實施，及對有關係各國之熱烈幹旋，僅半年之間，這許多殘餘的租界全部均告收囘。</p>
<p>包括永久不能收囘的上　公共租界的全部，在這樣短的期間，無代價而毫不費力的得以收囘，實是中國　野所　想不以的。</p>
<p>在大東亞戰爭　發之日前，上海的公共租界與其鄰接的法租界，同被稱爲國際的　都，爲罪惡的淵　。公共租界並也就是英美制　中國的牙城。投下了巨額的資本，操縱全中國的經濟界及金融界，擁護本國的權益外，且進而榨取。於是造成了中國事變，上海變爲援蔣計劃的基地，　力妨害日方的處理事變及國府政治，經濟建設。</p>
<p>祇要一想起這些事情，即知過去的上海公共租界對中日兩國完全是有害無益的存在。然而上海對華中繁榮的貢獻，其功亦不可歿，在日本看來，是大陸發展之重要的立脚點及舞台，在對華質易的擴展上，亦有很大的任務，尤以大東亞戰爭勃發後，英美的勢力從，剷除，其性質一變而日趨明朗化。因此，日本如其想代英美而把持租界，那是決計不可的。所以向建設大東亞共榮圈邁進　義之國日本，毅然計不出此，且進而允諾中國收囘。</p>
<p>全部租界取消後，中國的主權即告完全解放。國府今後應再建收囘後的全部租界區域，加緊爲完成完美的獨立國而努力不懈，以符關係各國的好意。（翔：譯自七月一日西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>（中央社滬訉）上海在過去成爲渝方　英　合作施展恐怖手段之根據地，且爲間　活躍之巢穴，自去年六月以後，敵方特務戰表面上似　終熄，但此決非敵方死心之謂，彼等當　日官憲不斷之檢舉彈　，成派新份子　入，　扶殖其勢力，策　擾　治安，</p>
<p>上海日軍憲兵隊根據聽檢舉之渝方份子口供，知悉彼　對重要公司工塲劇斱以及各種設施等，施展其毒手，乘當局警戒之間隙，伺機而動，故由　而知敵方份子與當地軍官司憲間，正展開激烈暗中鬥爭。同時，更須努力防範警戒，使敵人無隙可乘，蓋表面殊呈平靜，並非謂敵方特務戰已告終熄，此實爲日爲日方陸海軍警備部隊之嚴密警戒，及中日官憲　嚴農牧民檢舉，以及保甲自警團活動將彼　份子壓制使其無活動餘地。</p>
<p>茲單就最近一年中（迄今年六月底止一被上海日軍憲兵隊檢舉者而言。已逮獲忠救軍新四軍共產黨軍藍衣社正規軍三　賽季及C．C．團等敵方謀略份子共計二千七百餘名，內有中將四人，少將十五人，其他將校約二百人，沒敢之兵器三四〇，手槍一八〇，輕機關槍五，手榴彈四〇〇，靑龍刀二五TNT彈六七，抗日書籍六〇四三七六，無綫電機一八，各種彈藥八〇〇〇，地雷三，雷管四五，信管九〇，　彈筒五，導火綫一八米，以及其他武器甚夥，又收近敵方特務戰依然不斷，日憲兵對此等份子逐漸予檢舉，但因公開後將有碍於將來之搜查，故不能發表。總之，吾人對此絕對不能絲毫疏忽也。茲將上海日軍憲兵隊檢舉主要恐怖犯之略歷及行動探誌如次：（一）粉碎渝軍事委員會蘇浙行動隊，世一二月廿四日，檢舉暗殺國民政府社會部長陳濟成未遂犯。經調查結果，確認其幕後關係，嗣與工部局警察界協力克服種種困難，繼續搜查結果，始悉此與四月十三日狙撃南市領事館警察署巡查之兇犯有連帶關係，乃於五月十八日急　公共租界五馬路永樂舞廳及南市某兩處地方，逮獲渝軍事委員會蘇浙行動第二大隊第一組長俞樟樂等六人　搜出手槍二支等物，後續行搜查　又於五月二十四日急租界內之潛伏塲所，將繼指揮渝軍事委員會駐滬辦事處主任兼該委員會調查統計局蘇浙行動隊長少將某等十一人一綱打盡，沒收　槍十二支，子彈一四三九發，無綫電機一架，對該組織加以潰滅，查彼等直屬於渝軍事委員　，自二十九年十月以來，在上海杭州等地，製造恐怖事件二十二次，　年六月後，在上海恐怖事件似已終熄者，最大原因爲該組織已被潰滅之故。</p>
<p>（二）覆滅忠救軍上　行動　隊，上海日軍憲兵隊於去年九月二十二日及二十四日，分別有兩租界檢舉忠救軍上海行動總隊長等十六名，復收手槍子彈無綫電機等物，彼等曾於九月二十二月轟炸楊樹浦日本大醫院　至於忠救軍系幹　，悉遭逮部，該行動總隊之第一次行動，係在三十年五月　十八日，狙撃市警察局偵　隊副隊長，當塲殞命，前後共作破壞及狙撃工作十二次。</p>
<p>又與上項同機之事例多至不勝枚舉，彼等均自供稱「曾計劃各種恐怖行爲，惟因警戒嚴密，致無下手處，」故所得結論，可謂「警戒嚴密決不起恐怖事件。」全市市民應銘記以往所受敎訓，不因表血上呈平穩而致疏忽防範，注意敵人常伺機而　，不但公司工廠劇塲等，全市市民均宜各自防衛，以絕敵人陰謀，協力維持上海之安所。</p>

<h3>統一推進慈善事業的感想</h3>
<p>上海市貧病救　協會　離蘭亭林康侯袁履登</p>
<p>日前讀到申報社評「慈善事業急須統一推進」一文，針砭時弊，語重心長，令人感動，因爲其中提到蘭亭，康侯，履登等　發　創辦的「上海市貧病救濟協會」，且頗表期等之意，蘭亭等不能不就此問題，格抒觀感與意　。以答申報，並與社會先進諸君及熱心公益人士相商　，如　因此使今後慈善事業能收　理想的效果，則國家社會幸</p>
<p>（一）幾個問題的商榷</p>
<p>關於統一推進慈善事業的意義，申報社評已言之基詳，無庸更爲贅詞，凡百事業，欲求　發展而收成效，自非有組織有計劃不可：况慈善事業，爲社會人　之人事業，其範圍非同個人企業，一舉一動，關係千百萬人，如果統一的組織，遞詳的計劃，整齊的步驟，即難免事倍功半　且將貽誤人　社會。過去辦慈善事業者，不乏忠誠幹練之士，成績卓著，無可否認，但因缺乏統一的機構與整個的計劃，致其努力及其成績，或則於一隅，或限於一時，其兢業業鍥而不捨之精神　可欽佩，而奔　半世，歷盡即艱苦，祇獲滑滴之功，不能對國家社會作重大貢獻者，亦屬比比皆是。爲此，糾正一向散溫零落各自爲政之弊，統一推進，自屬必要，且爲當務之急。然而統一是一事，推進是一事，如何統一而又確實推進，尙待細心研究，此半亭等所欲提出商　者一。</p>
<p>統一推進慈善事業，原則上似乎不會有什麼問題，但是，由誰來統一推進慈善事業呢？近來「全體主義」一詞，頗爲風行，　權之說，在戰　尤爲囂然，在政治軍事或經濟方面，或者有其必要，但有慈善事業方面，所謂統一推　，是否有同一意義呢？蘭亭等認爲慈善事業與政治該施，　有　途同歸之義，但其動機，純出於不忍之心，田於人　間接　愛，故表現爲行動，完全爲一種人民自發自動的社會事業，　的成敗，不　於政府法令，全賴乎人類的良心。因此，在本質上，謂統一推進」　　似乎應當由　問，發的趨向於統一　　　們不願說過去數十年來官司竭事業及官督民　　榮失敗的痛史，單就辦理慈善紛柒　需　　　批專門人材，都是長期積累所得，不是什麼短　班專條班所能訓練出來的。所以，統推進的組織與人材，似乎還值得細心研究。此蘭　　　欲　出商　店二。</p>
<p>統一維進的原則如已確立，由統一推進的問題亦已解決，　進一步是亥可統一推進的問題，急待解決，例如在機構方面，是否面要一個統一推進慈善事業的中小機構方面，是否需要一年梳一推慈善事業的中心機構戲最簡及與與各是否需要一個疑統一推進慈善事業的中心機構或最三　機構，此種樣精的構成份子與組織形式外何，與政府及典各旣成慈善慈善成慈善團體之關係如何，皆非簡單原則所能解決。又如統一推進之具具體計劃推進讀統推進的原則如已確首先有賴球場主門人材之集不，調查工作之展開，研究　調工作之進，及　關係各方而聯絡之協讓工作之進，及班關係　各方而聯絡之一保特，然後乃可邀乃可邀而確立驀款工作的方某些工作的方針和推進今後慈　著事業的總旨領。蘭亭等所穀些提出商出警　。（不完）</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>起出經濟問題以外的　上海物價狂漲潮</h3>
<p>「他山之石，可以攻錯」。日前美國糧食管理局長戴維斯在　層　辭戰理由的函中說：「若不嚴格統制糧食供應，則恐不能有效控制通貨膨脹。」——近日上海的物價狂漲潮，愈來　烈：前本探源起來，固然第一是以米價狂漲爲一切物價狂漲的中心，其次則黃金作崇，亦足推波助潤：其實，這樣一個物價狂漲潮，恐怕已經起出經濟問題以外，而成爲含有政治意味的一種企圖；所謂企圖是什麼？就是要使通貨形成愈惡劣的膨脹，民生遭受愈嚴重的威　，正如七月四日大陸新報所說：「最近農產　　泓，當爲物價騰貴原因之一，然主要原因，却爲投機囤積份子對最近政治情勢，有意散佈有計劃之謠言，希圖鼓動全面漲風，此爲　明顯之事實。」</p>
<p>可是，鼓動物價全面漲風的意義，雖然是超出經濟問題以外，但其方法，總不外乎利用經濟範圍以內的工具，而最主要的，就是米與黃金，所以必須先來刺激米與黃金的狂漲。基於「治亂國，用重典」的原則　當局爲保持社會治安，維繋人民生計，實當便宜行事，嚴厲抑制米價與金價無理性的上漲；而最有效的臨時對策，厥爲强制執行限價，逮則予以最嚴厲的懲治，絲毫不假寬容。「一家哭，何如一路哭？」投機份子相對欷歔，何如一般市民相對欷歔？</p>
<h3>物資統制審委會　今日在京開會　商統會唐理事長赴京出席</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會下層機構二十二業聯合會，及粉麥油糧糖業棉業等四專業委員會，均已次第組織完成，對於統制物資之收買配給營運工作，已開始進行監督指導並組織小組會議，共同研究改進。同時並爲統制度一元化起見，及物資收買配給，採取統一步驟，聞該會理事長唐壽民氏，以物資統制審議委員會定今（六）日下午在京開會，特　車赴京出席會議，報告商總會下部機構組織經過情形外，對於今後物資統制進行方針，擬具重要提案，提出大會討論，付諸實施云。</p>
<h3>物資調查會　今起辦公　陳兼委長發表談話</h3>
<p>上海物資調查委員會，自六月十九日成立後，　積　　備，該會調查官及事務所，今日起開始正式辦公，昨承該會陳兼委員長發表談話，略謂：關於本會　置諸項要點，已見六月二十二日各報所載本人談話中。現查中日兩方調查官，業均聘任，由即日起開始執行職務，今後深望市民共體政府定安民生維持社會之苦心，與本會合作，對於囤積物資　操縱物價者，　情告發，俾可按法　辦，以期完成使命，物價得以平抑，民生得以安定云。</p>
<h3>社會福利局　調整勞工組織</h3>
<p>本市勞工團體，一經　社運會核准組織者，計有二百四十八個單位，自社　會改組爲　會福利局後，鑒於各勞工團體，因環境及其他種種關係，致組織不甚健全，特飭主管　第三科統制工會概况調查表，派員分赴各工會實地調查，並飭各工會負責人詳細填明　限　呈奉社會福利部及市府核准組織工人團體審查委員會詳加審查，對於組織不健全者，加以調整，現在積極審查中。</p>
<h3>春蘭蒐購將竣　各絲廠趕辦開車</h3>
<p>本年蘇浙兩省各地　蘭區，春蘭登塲後，各地絲廠商行即依照當局公定之市價，向產區收購春蘭，均已凖備恢復開車製絲·華中各地如「無錫·杭州·嘉興·湖州·及上海」等地繅絲廠家，已向財政部蘭絲建設特捐處申請登記者違一百五十餘家之多，其中以無錫小型絲廠約佔百分之八十以上，茲悉本市金融實業界領袖集股公司，經向產區收購之新蘭，業已陸續運滬，並已租定前豫豐絲廠爲該公司第一製絲廠，連元絲廠改爲第二製衣絲廠，兩廠共有絲車三百部左右，現正修理機車　本月內即可開車製絲，該公司並在杭州無錫兩處設立分公司，設第三第四第五製絲廠，亦將同時　車，聞本市面尙有鴻大絲廠有車二百四十部，亦將於本月內恢復開車製絲云。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股　　後圍　　穩，過程與金價無異，照各方人心似較　定，在喘　甚間，各股大都終仍軋升，百貨業之永安公司起落　巨，反跌爲漲，新新　碼枯短，易爲投資者提拉，進展獨速，國貨反　囘失傳，內衣盤於關口，福福·景綸　衫　亦在挺升中，光華百貨成交價亦高，永安紡織大關破入後，復又囘出，大生一二兩廠，達豐·榮豐紡織堅定逾恒，小票面綺美織造及大中華織造做價挺秀，南洋烟公司與閘北水　華商電氣挺升不止　惟大中華火榮獨見軋平，文化業中華呆定，商務與世界書局及永祥印書均在步升中，新藥業中法與新亞及中西均顯著下失傳，信誼及明星香水堅定，久安實業·通易信託·中興水柴·德豐針織·康元製罐等市均堅。挺</p>
<h3>各業公會動態</h3>
<p>咖啡館業　市咖啡館業同業公會，於昨五日假座嘉蕾咖啡館，召開成立大會。糧食局謝視察王任舶菩及市商會代表鐘英出席指　，當塲通過會章，並選舉樂委　，李　影，沈順福等爲理事，李滿存，黃明順爲監事。</p>
<p>心館業　本市點心館業同業公會，自上月二十五日成立以業，積極推通會務，除辦理同業入會登記外，關於同業所需各項原料，如麵粉油糖等，正在舉行普遍登記，一面分頭與本給機關接洽，期於短期內獲有解決辦法</p>
<h3>交還租界與上海經濟問題（一）</h3>
<p>先從安定物價入手</p>
<p>國民政府現在當　有兩個重要問題：一個是華北中央華問題，另一個是上海的再組織問題。自大東亞戰爭以還，努力從事與上海的再組織問題，因商統會的成立與上海公共租界的交還簽約，其骨幹大體將要完成。不過重要　的政治和經濟問題，尙待今後處理。例如物價問題，囤積問題，上海國民參政問題，商統會下層機構整飭問題等等，都亟待處理。現在率直的說一句，上海市民，對於所謂交還租界的歷史性的大業，向未能深切認識，爲使上海政治經濟有劃時代之進展北見，故對於上述各問題，尤以解決物價問題，必須集中全力以赴，以求解決，而安定民生。所以目前的上海經濟必須以民生問題爲中心。</p>
<p>在租界交還以前，經濟問題，已很嚴重，而交還租界，給予經濟界的影響　　！亦重大，這一點，決不能忽視，下面再來加以檢討。</p>
<p>政治與經濟的統一</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭後，上海經濟界如銀行，企業公司及其他事業等等，和政府要人全都有個人聯絡，關係不過經濟人和政界要人的聯絡，想藉此謀其經濟活動的安全，而政界要人與經濟界的個人聯絡，是要想　上海經濟界中培植其個人政治勢力之基礎。這種提携的方向，旣不純正，又不健全，爲統一合作着想，實在是一大障碍，幸自本年起，由此種變態的合作，轉進到正常合作的方途。大概有左列數點，歸爲明顯：（一）上海民許資本代表者的大量參加到全國經濟委員會。（二）因民間自治統　團體商統會之成立，而全面動員民族資本。（三）國府與上海經濟界在金融機構上之提携，例如民間金融資本家的參加　到中央儲備銀行參事會，中　的接收票據交換所，四行的改官商合辦。其中最重要的，當然就是商統　問題。行政當局對於商統　下層機構之同業公會的監督權，在形式上都歸市政府管理，而實際上則又分開幾個機構來辦，指導機關與監督機關要合作來處理物價問題，就有很大的困難，這些問題待租界交還以後　一切或有調整解決的可能性！（未完）（雲鵬：　自七月五日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>人生與志願</h3>
<p>— 川流</p>
<p>人生好像是一只船，而志願就是他最主要的舵；一只沈重穩固的船，必須要正確平衡的舵來主配，方能航行於汪汪大洋之間，有方向有目的地前進：否則，東蕩四飄，何所底止。反之，有其正確的舵，而無穩固的船，也是徒然不可能。所以，二者是相依爲命。在而，人生有何嘗不是　樣呢？志願就是生活中的巨輪，　着他的原力而推動。顯著的說：如果人有一日的存在，志願就不可一日的隔離。</p>
<p>這樣，志願與人生，有相互的密切關係，也就是每個人所需要的，接受的，那末，要想造就將來的事業必須從現實的真理上去製造如鋼一般的堅韌的志願，然後向着預定的目標　去，我想，決不會有失敗的遭遇。</p>
<p>可是，志願沒有想像中那般的輕而易得，他猶如披荊斬棘的獵着的，因爲，往往有的人，稍遇挫折，便免不了頹廢，消極，悲觀，失望，這是其中最大的缺點。假使沒有失望，那裏會有希望呢？所以，希望是從失望中鍛　成功的。例如現代的許許多多大發明家，科學家，文學家，他們一舉便會　震全球嗎？這是誰都否認的！由此可見也是失敗中成功的，不過，他們具有不折不撓的志願，和堅强的自信心，去克服任何一切的困難。所以有今日煇煌燦爛的名譽，普照在整個的世界，這不是抱定志願的成功嗎？那麼，志願是奠定人生的基礎，，所以誰也不能去毀減他！（報酬）</p>

<p>— 沈沈</p>
<p>「我　時　已經不早了，這要到河東　家說情去，恐怕司令部等不得，今夜阿坤必定吃苦頭的。阿坤嫂，你有田畢嗎？拿去押一押吧！」陸甲長催促着並且出了一個主意。</p>
<p>「阿坤嫂，快點吧！我　只有拿田單作押，別的辦法沒有了」，李　長慫恿着說。</p>
<p>阿坤的衰鳴咽着，手裏拿了豆光　跑進臥房去，在梳頭匣底下，拿起一個破藍而的小包，打開取出一張摺疊得緊緊的桑皮紙的田單，抖抖索索地交給李鎮長「這個田單請你們拿去吧！」</p>
<p>李鎮長　着一看，是二畝半田的一張田單，他暗付一下，這一張田單，不過押到六百元錢，恐怕不會滿足　布衣們的慾望，他想到這裏，就說道：「阿坤嫂，你家裏還有田單嗎？這……這……這一張，恐怕……恐怕不夠，押不到幾個錢。」</p>
<p>「噢！李行生，要多少錢，我！我家裏僅有這一份田單，別的沒有了，這還不夠，那！那怎麼辦呢？怎麼辦呢？」阿坤的妻面色更加蒼白，更加鳴咽的說不出話來。李鎮長聽了，看看阿坤妻的面色，更囘頭望着陸甲長眼瞪地呆住了半晌。</p>
<p>「我們去試試看，李先生，我們也曉得阿坤平索是太苦了，那裏還會有別的田單呢？要是辦不到的話，只好我們凑凑囉！」陸甲長十分　情地向着李鎮長說：</p>
<p>「也好！我們先去河東　　吧！阿坤嫂，你不要着愈，我們都是老鄰居，阿坤又是好人，我們總得盡力想法，大極今天晚上，阿坤會囘家的，你先息息吧！」李鎮長一邊把田單　　口袋裏，一連安慰着正在鳴咽的阿坤的妻。招呼着陸甲長走出阿坤家。外邊的目色微明，深來的晚風吹到臉上，已有　殺之意。兩個人加緊脚步，急怱怱地往河東　大伯家走去。黃家是鎮東的殷富。大家都　稱他黃老伯。他的兒子，是本區的區長，所以附近的人們，對他都很敬重。黃老伯爲人很豪爽，鄉鄰有什麼困難，　肯幫忙，不過這年頭，地方不　，他的做區長的兒子，勸他不要多管閒事，免得關出亂子，黃老伯也就深居　出，不大理會外事了。</p>
<p>李鎮長等兩人。到了黃家，黃老伯已經安歇了，他家的長工阿徐，是戲得李鎮長的，就　他們進門，經過李的說明，要見黃老伯有要事商量，阿徐進去報吿了，囘來就讓李陸兩人進入黃老伯的臥房。</p>
<p>「　　了，黃老伯！河西的阿坤，不如怎的被鎮上司令部裏抓了，　他通匪藏槍，犯罪很重。老伯！你也曉得的阿坤平素爲人忠厚，決不會有這種事情的。不過這年頭空着雙手，　沒有說話的份，提到冤枉兩字，先挨耳光。乾脆的說，這話是嚇嚇你們的，要錢倒是真的。老伯，你說對嗎？可是阿坤是　得飯都吃不飽，那裏來的錢呢？我們想來想去，只有請老伯幫幫忙，借一筆錢。這裏是阿坤的一張田單，作抵押品的　田單數目很小，這要請梅伯特別通融哩！」李鎮長誠懇地向黃老伯訴說，在口袋晨摸出摺疊緊緊的田單，交給黃老伯。（四）</p>

<h3>Construction of New Shanghai and Public Opinion Organs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Settlement has been officially scheduled for return on August 1st. The simultaneous return of the Shanghai French Concession should seemingly not be delayed. Following the abolition of extraterritoriality, all domestic concessions have also been recovered. Our nation's century of humiliation has thus been declared ended. The most important goal of the revolutionary and national salvation movement of our country over the past fifty years has been realized. The "freedom and equality for China among nations" and the "abolition of unequal treaties" sought by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang for more than forty years have gradually been realized. Therefore, on the one hand, we Chinese people are grateful to our friendly neighbor Japan for its assistance, which has allowed us to gradually embark on the road of independence and autonomy. On the other hand, we must recognize the increased responsibility and be deeply vigilant.</p>
<p>Today, we must point out to our compatriots across the country that while the abolition of extraterritoriality and the subsequent recovery of the Shanghai concessions are the result of the National Government's diplomatic policy over the past three years, they are, more precisely, a concrete manifestation of Japan's new policy towards China. This assistance from Japan has profound significance. From a historical perspective, the abnormal development of relations between China and Japan in recent decades has led to deep misunderstandings between the peoples of both countries. Especially since the Incident, the Chinese people have had a great misunderstanding of Japan's policies, viewing all friendly policies towards China as mere manifestations of "schemes." This popular sentiment has not been completely eliminated in recent years, and it is a major source hindering comprehensive peace between China and Japan. Now, from the abolition of extraterritoriality to the return of concessions, our friendly neighbor has fully demonstrated its sincerity towards China. From a forward-looking perspective, all countries in East Asia are watching: after Japan's friendly gestures, how will China demonstrate its own genuine ability? Therefore, we must remind the entire nation not to rejoice in one-sided phenomena. Now is the time for us to rise up and demonstrate our capabilities!</p>
<p>Whether we can perform well and live up to the expectations of our friendly neighbor depends first and foremost on how we govern Shanghai after its return. Because Shanghai, whether politically, economically, culturally, or in terms of Far Eastern relations, has always occupied a central and important position in China; and historically, Shanghai is also the place most imbued with Anglo-American aggression. Now that Anglo-American forces have been eliminated, if we can build it well, internally, we can promote the progress of politics, economy, and culture throughout China and become a model for building a new China; externally, we can demonstrate to all of East Asia that the Chinese nation has the ability to independently build a new China, that the Chinese nation has the ability to closely cooperate with friendly nations to build a new East Asia, and that the close cooperation between the two major nations of China and Japan can serve as a model for a new world order.</p>
<p>For the construction of new Shanghai, we firmly believe that the wise authorities must already have a comprehensive policy program. We believe that what is particularly important and must be prepared early so that it can be quickly realized is the establishment of a genuine public opinion organ in new Shanghai to assist the government. We believe that this public opinion organ must have the following basic conditions: First, in terms of functions and powers, it must be clearly stipulated that it has the power to assist the government in investigating and designing all municipal facilities, to provide opinions to the government, and to supervise special public welfare undertakings and facilities. We believe that only by establishing a public opinion organ with such powers can it serve as the eyes and ears of the government and the voice of the people, so that the government's undertakings are supported by the people and the people's hardships and demands are understood by the government. Only in this way can we effectively concentrate all the efforts of officials and the people to jointly shoulder the task of building new Shanghai. Otherwise, if the government is divorced from the people, any construction will be out of the question. Second, in terms of organization, it must be rigorous and flexible. It does not necessarily have to have a large form and organization, but it must be easy to carry out its work and exert its effectiveness. At the same time, in order to achieve this requirement, the organization of this public opinion organ itself must strive to avoid bureaucracy and officialdom, and from top to bottom, it must be finely divided and closely cooperate. Third, in terms of the selection of personnel, it must be particularly cautious. It must select leaders and specialized talents from among the genuine citizens who can represent the people and who are trusted and loved by the people.</p>
<p>The future of the construction of new Shanghai has a decisive significance for comprehensive peace and comprehensive cooperation between China and Japan, and for the Greater East Asia War and the New Order in Greater East Asia. The success or failure of this construction, on the one hand, depends on the government's future policy program and its implementation, and on the other hand, it depends on the establishment of the public opinion organ and its practical efforts. We sincerely expect the government to pay the utmost attention to this, to research and prepare, and we hope that social leaders and opinion circles will jointly discuss it to promote its success. May the municipal government authorities and leaders from all walks of life focus on the distant and the great, and at this time of abandoning the old and establishing the new, do some great things that will refresh the ears and eyes of the people of the country! For the sake of Shanghai, for the sake of China, and for the sake of the future of East Asia, we sincerely look forward to it!</p>

He has now completed his tasks and arrived safely in Syonan at 2:30 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>Syonan, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army announced at 4:00 PM this afternoon: Prime Minister Tojo, concurrently Minister of the Army, has arrived in Syonan today to consult with the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Expeditionary Army and other generals on military affairs, to take the opportunity to inspect the military strength of the Japanese forces in the South, to reward the hard work of the army and navy soldiers, and to discuss the new policies for the South that were previously announced.</p>
<p>Japan and Thailand Issue Joint Statement</p>
<p>Bangkok, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After Prime Minister Tojo arrived in Thailand on the 3rd, he formally met with Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram on the 4th to comprehensively review the relations between Japan and Thailand and exchange views on completing the war strategy. As a result, both sides reached complete agreement on the territory that Thailand has hoped to obtain for many years and on matters of cooperation between Japan and Thailand. It was confirmed that Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, and Terengganu in northern Malaya, as well as Kengtung and Mongpan states in the Shan States, would be incorporated into Thai territory. The Japanese Embassy in Thailand issued the following joint statement by Japan and Thailand at 2:00 PM (Thai time) on the afternoon of the 5th: General Hideki Tojo, Prime Minister and Minister of the Army of the Great Japanese Empire, and Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram, Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of Thailand, met in Bangkok on July 4th to review the overall war situation and the relations between Japan and Thailand, and exchanged views on plans such as uniting Greater East Asia to complete the common war. As a result, the two prime ministers reaffirmed that no matter how much the United Kingdom and the United States attempt to reverse their decline, the certainty of Greater East Asia's victory has been established, and they reaffirmed that each constituent of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, should unite as one, cooperate in the Greater East Asia War with the conviction of certain victory, and be able to complete it. Furthermore, during the talks, Prime Minister Tojo reiterated Japan's belief, namely, respecting Thailand's sovereignty and independence, and wishing Thailand to become more prosperous. The two prime ministers also held important discussions in a very amicable atmosphere on the territory that Thailand has hoped to obtain for many years and on matters of Thailand's cooperation with Japan. As a result, both sides reached complete agreement on the matter of incorporating Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, and Terengganu in northern Malaya, as well as Kengtung and Mongpan states in the Shan States, into Thai territory.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's Trip is of Great Significance</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - During the decisive period of constructing and waging war, Prime Minister Tojo personally visited China, Manchukuo, and the Philippines. This time, he is visiting Thailand and Syonan. On the 30th of last month, he departed from Tokyo with Sato, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, Yamamoto, Vice-Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and Yamamura, Director of the Political Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, taking the route through Saigon. He arrived in Bangkok on the 3rd and met with Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram on the 4th to exchange views. As a result, the two sides reached a consensus on a new mode of cooperation between Japan and Thailand. Prime Minister Tojo also inspected the current situation of Thailand's efforts in the war. On the 5th, he went to Syonan Special City to meet with General Terauchi, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, to inspect military affairs and encourage the local military, political officials, and civilians. Prime Minister Tojo's trip to Thailand has global significance. The meeting between the prime ministers of Japan and Thailand has epoch-making significance not only for Japan and Thailand but also for the entire Greater East Asia region. Because after Japan and Thailand issued a joint statement this time, what Prime Minister Tojo promised in his Greater East Asia Declaration at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet has now been realized. Thailand has resolutely maintained its independence in the past while resisting the oppression of the United Kingdom and the United States. To this day, it is still the only independent country in southern Asia. Therefore, in the future, Japan and Thailand, based on mutual trust and cooperation, can further strengthen the various policies of the Japanese government in Greater East Asia. Judging from the abolition of extraterritoriality in China and the return of concessions and the joint statement between Japan and Thailand this time, it proves that Japan aims to respect the independence and sovereignty of all countries in Greater East Asia and strongly promote this policy based on mutual reliance and cooperation. This is another new piece of evidence to clarify this to the world.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Tojo Delivers a Speech at the Banquet Hosted by the Thai Prime Minister; Bangkok, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch)</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech on the evening of the 4th at a banquet hosted by Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram, saying: "Today, I am deeply pleased to have fulfilled my long-cherished wish to visit your country. Your country's people have resolutely maintained their glorious independence and the honor of the peoples of Asia amidst the turmoil of the world situation over the years. The great leader, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram, has personally led the people of the country to awaken the national spirit, strengthen national power, expand national influence, and continue to strive for the revival of East Asia. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Thailand resolutely abandoned its complex and subtle relationship with the United Kingdom and the United States and took joint action with Japan. Since then, it has overcome numerous difficulties, cooperated with the Japanese army on the front lines, and devoted all its efforts to resolutely work hard to carry out the war. I deeply appreciate Thailand's united struggle and cooperation with Japan. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt respect and gratitude. Although my stay in your country is very short, I am very happy to have had cordial talks with Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram and to have gathered together with dignitaries from all walks of life in your country to shake hands and celebrate. Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram clearly stated in his talks with me that he shared the belief in certain victory and the determination to carry out the war, and that we were in complete agreement on a new mode of cooperation between Japan and Thailand. Such closer mutual understanding between Japan and Thailand is not only gratifying to me, but also commendable for promoting the cooperation between the two countries in the war. Before my arrival, the Thai people presented the sacred relics of the Buddha to the Japanese people, which is enough to enhance the spiritual unity of the two peoples. I sincerely thank the people for this pure friendship. Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram and everyone present, the victory of Greater East Asia and the state of repelling the enemy have become increasingly stronger, and abundant resources are rapidly being transformed into war power. This is enough to be the death knell for the United Kingdom and the United States. At this time, the solidarity of the people of Greater East Asia is increasingly strong, and they are working hard to reduce the autumn of the United Kingdom and the United States. I am convinced that each country and people in Greater East Asia will be able to win the honor of victory in the Greater East Asia War for their own existence and prosperity. Japan will continue to respect Thailand's sovereignty and territory, and it will more deeply cherish the prosperity of Thailand's national fortune, and at this time, it will strengthen its cooperation and assistance to the Thai government led by Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram. I hope that the Thai people will further understand Japan's true intentions and work together to expand Thailand's national prestige, to carry out the Greater East Asia War, and to limit the revival between Greater East Asia."</p>
<h3>The Japanese Prime Minister Presents a Marshal's Sword to Terauchi at a Certain Base</h3>
<p>Syonan, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, Prime Minister Tojo arrived at Syonan Island on the 5th and presented Marshal Terauchi, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Expeditionary Army, with the sword of the Marshal bestowed by His Majesty the Emperor at a certain base.

<h3>The Japanese Prime Minister Visits Syonan to Comfort the Soldiers on the Front Lines; Syonan, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch)</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo, concurrently Minister of the Army, arrived in Syonan on the afternoon of the 5th and immediately drove to the military headquarters, where he met with the supreme commander of the Southern Expeditionary Army. After resting, he listened to reports from the commanders of various units, then gave a speech to the local troops and soldiers, and after holding cordial talks with the supreme commander, he met with the local indigenous people who came to pay their respects. In his speech to the Japanese soldiers, Prime Minister Tojo said that thanks to the efforts of the soldiers on the ground, the results of the war have been expanded, and the construction of the occupied areas is also progressing day by day, which is commendable. Looking at the current situation, it shows that the war has reached a decisive stage, especially the counterattack of the United Kingdom and the United States, which is becoming increasingly active. This situation cannot be taken lightly. Therefore, in order to maintain a strong army, it is hoped that each unit will work harder in training in the future.</p>
<p>Syonan, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement when he arrived in Syonan on the afternoon of the 5th, saying: "The purpose of my trip abroad is to visit Thailand and personally witness the situation of the Greater East Asia War being carried out under the unity of the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, and to inspect the military situation in the South, to comfort the Japanese soldiers who are working day and night for the country, as well as the compatriots who are working hard under military and political administration. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to liberate East Asia from the shackles of the United Kingdom and the United States. Because the United Kingdom and the United States have been entrenched in East Asia for a long time, disturbing the peace of East Asia and exploiting to the best of their ability, the ethnic groups of Greater East Asia should cooperate with each other to establish a state of enjoying the joy of co-prosperity. Now, the rise and fall of the 1 billion ethnic groups in Greater East Asia depend on whether the Greater East Asia War can be completed, and the belief that each country and ethnic group in Greater East Asia will always help each other is the reason for completing this war. Since the Incident, it has been a year and a half, and the Japanese army has driven the enemy out of East Asia, completely occupied its bases, and ensured that the strategic situation of certain victory is becoming increasingly stronger. The abundant resources of Greater East Asia are rapidly being transformed into war power. At this time, each country and ethnic group in Greater East Asia should understand the significance of this war and Japan's good faith, and sincerely unite as one to move towards a common goal. Now, the ambition of the United Kingdom and the United States to suppress East Asia has been reduced, and its delusional thoughts must not be allowed to revive in East Asia. The resolute rise of the people of India to achieve freedom and prosperity has decided to take unified action with us. I express my gratitude to the people of Greater East Asia who are standing on the same front as Japan, and at the same time, my belief in certain victory is becoming stronger and stronger, and I believe that the future is full of light, and I am determined to fight until the final victory of the Greater East Asia War is achieved."</p>

I would like to express my great sincerity and gratitude to Thailand for its combat power in cooperating with Japan to carry out the Greater East Asia War! This visit will deepen the mutual understanding and reliance between Japan and Thailand. At the same time, the specific methods of the new cooperation adopted by Japan towards Thailand and the opinions between Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram are completely consistent, which is what I am most concerned about. Therefore, various sincere treatments are in fact the cooperative relationship between Japan and Thailand, and it is sincerely fortunate for Thailand to be a member of the East Asian allies. At the time of my visit to Thailand, I would like to express my gratitude and thanks for the earnest sincerity and enthusiasm of the Thai government and people. At the same time, I hope to further develop the cooperation between Japan and Thailand and move towards the path of common victory."</p>

<h3>Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, Wang Kemin, Takes Office Yesterday; Ambassador Tani to China Sends a Congratulatory Telegram; The Government and People Express Deep Hopes</h3>

<p>Beiping, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Mr. Wang Kemin, the newly appointed member of the North China Government Commission of the National Government, officially arrived at the meeting at 9:30 AM on the 5th. The handover was handled by the acting chairman.

The newly appointed Commissioner attended the first meeting of the Standing Committee members and held various cordial talks. The following is a transcript of Mr. Wang's speech at the inauguration ceremony: "I have been entrusted with the heavy responsibility of Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission by the National Government. At the beginning of my tenure, I would like to express my feelings to all colleagues and work together with the people to encourage each other. We all know that the Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation for the East Asian people. The progress of the war is related to the rise and fall of China and Japan, as well as the survival of all the ethnic groups in East Asia. Therefore, China and Japan should cooperate with each other with the spirit of sharing life and death and with unswerving righteousness to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States in order to win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the most important thing is to lay the foundation for lasting peace in East Asia. North China is an important base for the rear defense industry of the Greater East Asia War and an important area for the revitalization of China. Therefore, its mission is profound and significant. The policy of "China-Japan cooperation, establishing security, developing industry, and achieving self-sufficiency in food," which was determined by the late Chairman Zhu, is an important task for the construction of North China. In the future, I will do my best to materialize it so that the important mission of building North China can be accomplished as soon as possible. Since his appointment, Chairman Zhu has been working from illness until he died for the country. I deeply admire the great spirit of sacrifice of the late Chairman Zhu. In the future, I will sincerely inherit the will of the late Chairman and complete his legacy. At this time of severe circumstances, our officials and people should be diligent in their duties, do their best, recognize our mission, gather the total strength of the country, and work together to complete the arduous task."</p>
<p>Beiping, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Tani Masayuki, the Japanese Ambassador to the Republic of China, sent a telegram to Mr. Wang Kemin, the new Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, on the 5th to express his congratulations.

<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - People from all walks of life in Manchuria expressed their condolences on the death of Mr. Zhu Shen, the late Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission of our country, and were particularly concerned about the selection of his successor. The National Government has appointed Mr. Wang Kemin as his successor, and Manchuria is deeply pleased with this. Mr. Wang made the greatest efforts to build a new order in East Asia during the Provisional Government era. This time, he will further promote the cooperation between North China and Manchuria, and we have unlimited expectations for this. Mr. Wang and Prime Minister Zhang and other leaders of Manchuria are old acquaintances. Mr. Wang visited Manchuria in mid-May of this year and held cordial talks with the leaders of Manchuria. This time, he has risen again to stand on the front line of the construction of North China, which will enable the political and economic cooperation between North China and Manchuria to exert its unique ability to complete the responsibility of destroying the United Kingdom and the United States and building North China, which is truly worth looking forward to.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - Recent reports have stated that the floods in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are severe. In order to understand the relationship between the upstream flooding and the downstream, the reporter specifically visited the water conservancy authorities. According to them, the Chongqing river surface is relatively narrow, and the flood is due to flash floods in the area, which are suddenly contained, so the rise and fall are very rapid. The downstream flow of the Yangtze River is formed by the confluence of water from Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, especially the Han River in Hubei Province, which has the greatest impact. If all these provinces have heavy rains and floods at the same time, then only Sichuan Province will be affected, and it will not necessarily cause a chain reaction of disasters along the downstream coast. According to the investigation, the Nanjing water level on the 4th of this month was 2.4 meters lower than the highest water level in the 20th year of the Republic of China, 2 meters lower than the prescribed danger level, and 3 centimeters lower than the prescribed flood prevention start level, so the water situation has not yet reached a dangerous level. The water levels of the Huai River and the Grand Canal have also recently subsided. However, in order to prevent problems before they occur, the Ministry of Construction has already drafted the outline of the flood prevention measures for the 32nd year, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan and distributed to various provinces and cities for implementation. The Nanjing Municipal Government and the Jiangsu and Anhui Construction Halls have all established flood prevention organizations and are engaged in prevention work.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy and Air Force Strongly Attack Lembata Island, Inflicting Considerable Damage on Enemy Forces; Darwin Port Continues to Be Bombed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 11:30 on the 5th: On July 2nd, Japanese army and navy air units attacked Lembata Island, causing a large fire in the vicinity of the enemy landing site, claiming to have shot down nine enemy aircraft, bombed and destroyed one enemy transport ship, and sunk many boats. We suffered no losses.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - After the US military landed on Lembata Island, they suffered heavy damage due to continuous strong attacks by Japanese army and naval air units. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the Japanese naval combat aircraft suddenly attacked the enemy combat aircraft group in the area, and engaged in fierce air combat with the enemy's Lockheed "P38" aircraft, immediately shooting down nine of the new, fast, twin-engine, twin-fuselage aircraft. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. Before this, at dawn on the 2nd, several Japanese destroyers entered Lembata Port, which was heavily guarded by many torpedoes and high-speed boats. The Japanese ships sank one enemy torpedo boat, heavily damaged another, and then advanced to the four shores of the island, fiercely bombarding several enemy positions, inflicting considerable damage on the enemy before skillfully advancing to other locations.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 p.m. on the 5th: Japanese expeditionary air units attacked Darwin Port and Broome successively on June 28th and 30th, shooting down 15 enemy aircraft in the area and destroying two military facilities, causing them to catch fire.

<h3>Australian Parliament Dissolved, Elections Scheduled for August 2nd</h3>

<h3>Several Thousand Soviet Prisoners of War Released and Repatriated</h3>
<p>Ankara, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuter's dispatch: Several thousand Soviet soldiers who were sent back from German and Italian prisoner-of-war camps to their homeland set out today.

<h3>Weygand's Visit to Washington is Purely Military in Nature; French Military Commander Temporarily Replaced by Jouain</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to American news: French rebel leader Weygand flew across the South Atlantic yesterday and is expected to arrive in Washington within 24 hours. After arriving at Miami, Florida from Natal, Brazil, he will immediately go to Washington to meet with President Roosevelt and will stay for several weeks, where he will be entertained by President Roosevelt. At the same time, Algiers has decided to send a representative to Martinique. However, Weygand is not directly concerned about Laval Robert's negotiations with the United States to change the regime on the island. Therefore, Weygand's visit to the United States is clearly purely military in nature. In addition, according to news from Algiers, Major Bouffard, Major Borgeais, and Captain Villeret are all traveling with Giraud.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to Agence France-Presse: French High Commissioner for North Africa Giraud has appointed General Jouain to serve as the commander-in-chief of the French army in North Africa and West Africa during his visit to the United States.</p>
<h3>Martinique Negotiations Concluded</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - Cable from San Juan: The negotiations between US government representative Vice Admiral Hoover and Martinique Governor Admiral Robert have now temporarily ended.</p>
<p>Madrid, 4th (Central News Agency) - The German news agency revealed today that Admiral Robert, High Commissioner of Martinique, submitted three conditions for changing the current state of the French island of Martinique to Vice Admiral Hoover, the representative of the US government, to be taken back to San Juan, Puerto Rico, for instructions from his home country. The conditions are as follows: (1) Guarantee French sovereignty over the island; (2) No foreign troops shall be stationed on the island; (3) Continue to supply the island with food. If these conditions are accepted, Robert hopes to avoid the suffering of the people from famine due to the anti-Axis blockade.</p>
<h3>Polish Prime Minister Sikorski Dies in Plane Crash; His Position is Temporarily Filled by Mikolajczyk; German Sources Suspect Assassination</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a British Air Force communiqué from London: General Sikorski, the former Polish Minister of the Army and current Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile in London, died last night when the "Liberator" bomber he was traveling in crashed while taking off from Gibraltar. Previous reports stated that General Sikorski's daughter also died tragically at the same time, but the communiqué did not mention this. London Broadcasting said that General Klimacki and other officers of the General Staff accompanied Sikorski on the trip. Only one pilot survived and is currently hospitalized. The Polish government-in-exile in London immediately convened an emergency meeting.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London: The Polish government-in-exile announced this afternoon that it has appointed Mikolajczyk to act as Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile in London. The position of Chief of Staff General Klimacki will be temporarily held by Minister of the Army Kukiel.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - Havas reports: According to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The current situation clearly shows that Polish Prime Minister-in-exile General Sikorski was murdered. Because Sikorski's policies have placed relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in a stalemate, the stalemate can at least be temporarily broken after Sikorski's death. Information obtained by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs today is sufficient to prove that General Sikorski was murdered by a secret intelligence agency.</p>
<h3>Selected Current Affairs Translations: Return of the Shanghai International Settlement</h3>
<p>The issue of handling the Shanghai International Settlement has been rapidly unfolding since Ambassador Gu returned to his post. The opinions of the local embassy and the army and navy have become consistent, and consultations are currently being sought from the central government. The return of the International Settlement will soon be realized. According to the Sino-Japanese Agreement on the Return of Concessions and the Abolition of Extraterritoriality, which was concluded simultaneously with the National Government's entry into the war on January 9th, the return of the exclusive concessions, the Beijing Legation Quarter, and the Xiamen Gulangyu International Settlement was implemented on March 30th. Furthermore, France has also returned its three exclusive concessions, and the remaining Shanghai exclusive concession is also prepared to be returned at the same time as the International Settlement. In the end, the Shanghai International Settlement, the stronghold of British and American dominance in China for the past century, will also be recovered due to Japanese goodwill. Thus, China has gained complete autonomy and independence, and has been freed from the shackles of all unequal treaties. This is truly something to celebrate for China. At the same time, the construction of Greater East Asia has also taken a step forward.</p>
<p>Needless to say, pre-Greater East Asia War Shanghai was a stronghold of British and American vested interests in China, and also the accumulation point of their interests in China. About 80% of their investments in China's banking, import/export, and commerce were concentrated in Shanghai, and about 70% of industrial and real estate investments. How Britain and the United States used this stronghold to exploit China, instigate unrest in East Asia, and plan to alienate China and Japan is beyond detailed description. Even if all other concessions were returned, Shanghai would be maintained to the end at all costs, and the reason for this is precisely this. After the takeover of the concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the administrative organ exclusively occupied by Britain and the United States, will inevitably be abolished at the same time, and a district office under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipality, headed by Chinese, will be newly established. The Shanghai Special Municipal Government will be the highest administrative office in Shanghai. Shanghai accounts for half of China's foreign trade and most of China's productivity, and occupies a central position in China's economy. Moreover, it has always been in the position of a British and American colony. The new Shanghai now eliminates the British and American colors and redevelops under the nature of East Asia. The responsibility of China for building a new Shanghai is extremely important. (Xiang: Translated from the June 27th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<p>All Foreign Concessions in China Completely Recovered</p>
<p>Shanghai's International Settlement will soon be recovered by the National Government, and the Shanghai French Concession will also be returned. All foreign concessions in China, which have bound China's sovereignty and hindered its independence and integrity for a century, have been eliminated.</p>
<p>The Beijing government formally requested the recovery of concessions and the restoration of other national rights at the Paris Peace Conference. After 25 years, China has fully achieved its goal.</p>
<p>Before the National Government entered the war on January 9th, China had recovered ten concessions in four locations: Hankou, Zhenjiang, Jiujiang, and Xiamen through its own efforts. There were sixteen exclusive concessions and two public concessions remaining. However, the common front between China and Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War became more consolidated due to the National Government's entry into the war. Due to the rapid implementation of Japan's new policy towards China and the enthusiastic mediation of relevant countries, all these remaining concessions have been recovered in just half a year.</p>
<p>Including the entire Shanghai International Settlement, which was considered permanently unrecoverable, the fact that it could be recovered without compensation and without effort in such a short period is something that China never dreamed of.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Shanghai International Settlement and its adjacent French Concession were known as an international metropolis and a source of evil. The International Settlement was also the stronghold of British and American control over China. It invested huge amounts of capital, manipulated China's economic and financial circles, and protected its own interests, and even further exploited. This led to the China Incident, and Shanghai became a base for the Chiang Kai-shek aid plan, hindering Japan's handling of the incident and the National Government's political and economic construction.</p>
<p>Just thinking about these things makes it clear that the Shanghai International Settlement of the past was completely harmful and useless to both China and Japan. However, the contribution of Shanghai to the prosperity of Central China cannot be denied. From Japan's perspective, it is an important foothold and stage for mainland development, and also has a great mission in expanding trade with China. Especially after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, with the elimination of British and American forces, its nature has changed and become clearer. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible for Japan to take over the concession in place of Britain and the United States. Therefore, Japan, the country of righteousness, resolutely did not take this approach and instead agreed to China's recovery in order to move towards building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>After the abolition of all concessions, China's sovereignty was completely liberated. The National Government should now rebuild all the recovered concession areas and intensify its efforts to complete a perfect independent country in order to live up to the goodwill of the countries concerned. (Xiang: Translated from the July 1st Western Daily News)</p>

<p>The Nanshi, Shanghai Fourth, and Pudong districts issued it on the 28th of last month. As for the International Settlement and Zhabei districts, the distribution was delayed because the goods could not be delivered in time. It is said that the delivery is about to be completed, and the International Settlement and Zhabei districts can issue it soon. This time it is raw oil, and each person is still limited to four ounces, with the price being five yuan, three jiao, and five and a half cents.

<h3>Industry Valuation Committees Convene Extraordinary Meetings; Review Whether Price Limits Meet Standards; Resolutely Enforce and Request Increased Supply of Goods</h3>
<p>The trade associations of various industries in this city previously established goods valuation committees, formulated regulations, and notified all member companies to comply. According to reporters, the valuation committees of each industry, in view of the recent resurgence of chaos in the prices of goods, which has caused anxiety among the people, feel unable to sit idly by. In recent days, they have convened extraordinary meetings to strictly review whether the previously set price limits meet standards. As a result of the discussions, in addition to strictly enforcing price limits, they have also requested the authorities to increase the supply of goods so that they can be sold at retail outlets.</p>
<p>Price Labeling for Sales: All companies must label any goods sold at retail outlets in prominent places according to the set price limits. The size of the fonts and the style of the labels must be in accordance with the regulations of the authorities to ensure that every customer can easily see and understand them clearly. Companies must not deliberately make things difficult for customers who want to purchase certain goods, so as to avoid causing disputes. If the price of the goods does not match the labeled price limit, or if it is discovered that the quality has been lowered, customers can raise questions or send a letter to the industry association with the store number, address, and details of the sale.</p>
<p>Strictly Investigate Smuggling: The relevant authorities have long issued separate and clear regulations regarding the transportation of various goods, and all legitimate businesses in the industry have complied. However, some small vendors, due to their limited capital, continue to smuggle goods privately. It is reported that the police department of the municipal authorities is quite resentful of the fact that some vendors are openly complying but secretly violating the regulations by continuing to smuggle goods out of the country, and has decided to severely punish them. Therefore, anyone carrying large or heavy packages on the road must be strictly investigated by detectives. If it is found that there are prohibited items and attempts to smuggle them out of the country, they will be confiscated and confiscated or prosecuted according to law.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Joint Operation Agency Continues to Purchase Rice and Grain; Sends Personnel to Rice-Producing Areas to Negotiate Purchase and Transportation Matters</h3>
<p>All sectors attach great importance to the overall food problem in this city. The food rationing mechanism has been adjusted and is in place. The Rice and Grain Joint Operation Agency in the Shanghai area, with the assistance and supervision of the Ministry of Food and the Shanghai Food Committee, can smoothly purchase and transport grain, and there is no need for citizens to worry unnecessarily. In addition, 200,000 piculs of rice purchased from Suzhou, Yangzhou, and Huzhou are already on their way to Shanghai, so the next round of rations can be distributed on schedule and the quantity can be restored to its former state. At this time, the Rice and Grain Joint Operation Agency has sent more than 40 purchasing and transportation personnel to various rice-producing areas such as Suzhou, Wujiang, Songjiang, Jinshan, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Taicang, Changshu, Huzhou, and Yangzhou to negotiate purchase and transportation matters with the local Rice and Grain Joint Operation Agencies.

As for the service personnel of this committee, they have been instructed to serve impartially and not to have any behavior that violates their duties, so as not to disappoint the government and the expectations of the citizens."</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Grain Merchants Arrested; More Than One Hundred People Apprehended at Deyilou in the City</h3>
<p>Recently, the market price of grain has soared and risen incessantly, and people from all walks of life are in panic. The authorities have repeatedly issued rumors, but speculators continue to push up prices, so the miscellaneous grain market has been closed under the authorities' attention. However, a group of speculative grain merchants gathered at Deyilou in the City God Temple in Nanshi, working as a paradise, secretly operating an underground market. At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, they were suddenly rounded up, and 104 people were arrested on the spot. Except for some who have been released, those suspected of disrupting the market will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Fifth Shanghai News Scholarship Begins Registration Today; Each Group Submits Forms on the Specified Dates; Existing Scholarships are Difficult to Provide Universal Assistance</h3>
<p>The distribution of application forms for scholarships for students at all levels in this year's Shanghai News Readers' Scholarship ended yesterday afternoon.

Registration is scheduled to begin today. In order to avoid congestion, it has been decided to accept application registration forms in stages and groups.

<p>Yesterday, Kang Yuan Factory Generously Donated a Large Sum of Money; Enthusiastic People from All Walks of Life: In view of the large number of students applying to this newspaper this year, and reviewing the existing scholarships of this newspaper, there is a regret that it is difficult to provide universal assistance. They have donated large sums of money to this righteous cause. Yesterday, Kang Yuan Can Making Factory generously donated 5,000 yuan. The factory felt the suffering of the students and made this grand wish, which is a model for the business community. It is hoped that powerful people in the industrial and commercial circles will continue to donate to benefit the young people who are about to lose their schooling.</p>
<p>Mrs. Feng's Funeral Expenses Partially Used for Scholarships: Yesterday, Mr. Feng Bingnan sent a letter saying: "To the editor, my late mother instructed that a portion of the funeral expenses should be respectfully declined. I am honored to receive the sympathy of relatives and friends. My late mother was happy to do good deeds in her life. I am sending this letter on her behalf, requesting that relatives and friends prepare the necessary funds for the funeral and convert them into cash for social welfare undertakings. I have specially allocated 1,500 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes to be transferred to the Shanghai News Scholarship Fund. I am only afraid that the distribution is too wide and the amount is too small, and I am afraid of being mocked for using a cup of water to put out a fire." The Feng family's willingness to assist this newspaper's scholarship work and benefit the poor is deeply admired.</p>
<p>Zhizhong Girls' Middle School Sets Up Free Quotas: A letter from the private Zhizhong Girls' Middle School stated that in this day and age, the educational crisis is at its extreme. Those who are well-off have no intention of learning and only indulge in play; those who are ambitious are forced by livelihood to struggle to make a living, let alone study. Knowledge is abandoned, and talents are wasted. The harm is unimaginable. The school has added 20 free quotas for the poor with the proceeds from the charity sale of cooperation fans donated by Feng Wenfeng, Chen Xiaocui, Xie Yuemei, and Gu Fei during the New Year's Eve. There are 5 places for High School 1, 3 places for High School 2, 2 places for High School 3, 5 places for Junior High School 1, 3 places for Junior High School 2, and 2 places for Junior High School 3. This newspaper is entrusted to test the results of the students applying for this year's scholarship and investigate the family situation to ensure that they are indeed poor, and then select the best to send. If the academic performance is excellent, they will be allowed to study for free until they complete their studies. The school's assistance in this newspaper's scholarship work is admirable.</p>
<p>Cheng She Charity Performance Raises Funds for Scholarships: In order to help raise funds for the Shanghai News and News Daily scholarships, the Cheng She Tongle Association will hold a charity performance of the drama "Wu Zetian" at the Lyceum Grand Theatre, starting the day after tomorrow.

<h3>Mayor Chen Delivers Speech, Urging Citizens to Economize: The Nation's Rise and Fall Is the Responsibility of Every Citizen; Thrift and Savings Cultivate National Strength</h3>
<p>Our nation has always valued thrift and frugality. Recently, the New Citizens' Movement has also been vigorously promoting thrift and savings. Especially during this time of global conflict, everywhere is consuming more than it produces and destroying more than it builds. Therefore, all countries around the world are striving for simplicity and saving resources, either for use in war or for storage for the future. Many countries face material shortages, and their citizens' material lives are more difficult than in our country. Take our friendly nation, Japan, for example. Its citizens, to economize and serve the nation, are vigorously promoting movements like short clothes and one-dish meals, contributing their savings to the nation and purchasing national bonds. This spirit is highly commendable. Our nation's production industry has long lagged behind, and the consumption situation in various cities is excessively extravagant. At this time of national crisis, with disaster in northern Shanghai, and when East Asian nations are at a critical juncture of united struggle, we really should not continue to be extravagant and wasteful, directly consuming personal wealth and energy and indirectly affecting national resources. We must understand that the nation's rise and fall is the responsibility of every citizen, that grains of sand make a tower, and that many small things make a fur coat. I deeply hope that all citizens will encourage each other, practice thrift, and engage in savings. Individuals can avoid hunger and cold, and it will further cultivate national strength. If one person can be thrifty and save, then one person becomes wealthy. If one family can be thrifty and save, then one family becomes wealthy. I wish to encourage all citizens to work together towards this goal.</p>
<p>Okazaki's Speech Encouraging Savings: Regarding the matter of encouraging savings, Mr. Okazaki, Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, made a statement saying that this time, the local Japanese organization established the China National Bonds Digestion Savings Promotion Committee. In addition to past sales of national bonds, they are also starting to encourage savings. The newspaper of June 27 also contained a statement by Mr. Tajiri, the committee chairman. This measure is especially timely in light of the current Shanghai situation. To carry out the Greater East Asia War, the local Japanese residents can all take the lead in embodying this spirit and diligently practice savings to serve the country, which is truly gratifying. However, this should not be limited to the Japanese. All people in the Shanghai area must practice it. If all Shanghai citizens jointly implement savings and economical consumption, then the rising trend of prices can certainly be stopped. As the Greater East Asia War gradually enters a decisive stage, and as China, Japan, Germany, Italy, and other Axis countries move forward vigorously towards final victory, there should be an even deeper understanding of this point. We must strive to save on consumption and increase savings in order to ensure the smooth advancement of price policies and also ensure the stability of citizens' lives. In short, maximizing savings is truly an infinite benefit for citizens. Therefore, I hope for economical consumption and the encouragement of savings. I urge all citizens to deeply reflect, provide comprehensive cooperation, and so on.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping Case at Wan Tai Factory Cracked by Police</h3>
<p>Zhang Hongwei, the son of Zhang Ying, the owner of the Wan Tai Machinery Factory on Baoding Road, who lives at No. 319 Yuezhou Road, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits at 10:20 PM on the 30th of last month. The hired nanny, Tang Cuilan, also disappeared at the same time. At the same time, a threatening letter left by the bandits was obtained, demanding a ransom of one million yuan. The case was reported to the Huishan Police Station, and Chinese Detective Shang Wu, Detectives Zhong Zongtong, Jin Lihou, etc., arrested a Shanghai woman named Jin Meiying on the 2nd of the month. At the time, Jin was loitering and watching at Zhang's door, thus attracting the attention of the detectives. A citizen's card of Tang Cuilan was found on her person, but the photo on it was Jin's. Under strict questioning, Jin confessed to participating in the kidnapping of Zhang Hongwei and revealed the location of her accomplices. The detectives arrested Jin Wenxiang and Pan Tongfu in Yangjing Town, Pudong, and confiscated a handgun, three bullets, and a pair of handcuffs.

<h3>Shanghai Japanese Military Police: Report Undesirable Elements; More Than Two Thousand Arrested in the Past Year</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Shanghai has become a base for the Chongqing side and the British to carry out terrorist activities, and a nest for spies to operate. Since June of last year, the enemy's special warfare seems to have ended on the surface, but this is not to say that the enemy has given up. They are constantly sending new elements to infiltrate and foster their power, planning to disturb public order, under the constant surveillance and suppression of the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>According to confessions from Chongqing elements reported by the Shanghai Japanese Military Police, they learned that they were carrying out their vicious schemes against important companies, factories, theaters, and various facilities, taking advantage of the authorities' vigilance. Therefore, it can be seen that the enemy elements and local military and judicial officials are engaged in a fierce secret struggle. At the same time, it is necessary to make efforts to prevent and be vigilant so that the enemy has no opportunity to take advantage of. The fact that the surface appears calm does not mean that the enemy's special warfare has ended. This is due to the close vigilance of the Japanese Army and Navy garrison troops, the strict investigation and reporting by Chinese officials and the people, and the activities of the Baojia self-defense groups, which have suppressed these elements and left them no room for activity.</p>
<p>Looking only at those reported by the Shanghai Japanese Military Police in the most recent year (up to the end of June this year), more than 2,700 enemy plotters have been arrested, including members of the Loyalty and Salvation Army, the New Fourth Army, the Communist Army, the Blue Shirts Society, the Regular Army of the Third War Zone, and the C.C. Group, including four lieutenant generals, fifteen major generals, and about two hundred other generals and officers. Confiscated weapons include 340 firearms, 180 handguns, 5 light machine guns, 400 hand grenades, 25 Qinglong swords, 67 TNT explosives, 60,437 anti-Japanese books, 18 wireless radios, 8,000 various types of ammunition, 3 land mines, 45 detonators, 90 fuses, 5 projectile tubes, 18 meters of fuse, and many other weapons. It can be seen that the enemy's special warfare is still ongoing. The Japanese military police are gradually reporting these elements, but because public disclosure would hinder future searches, it cannot be announced. In short, we must not be negligent in the slightest. The following is a brief history and action report of the main terrorists reported by the Shanghai Japanese Military Police: (1) Crushing the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission's Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Team. On December 24th, they reported the attempted assassination of Chen Jicheng, Minister of Social Affairs of the National Government. After investigation, the relationship behind it was confirmed. Later, in cooperation with the police in the Public Concession, they overcame various difficulties. Continuing the search, they learned that this was related to the murderer who sniped at the police officer of the Nanshi Consulate Police Station on April 13th. Therefore, on May 18th, they urgently searched the Yongle Ballroom on Wuma Road in the Public Concession and two places in Nanshi, arresting Yu Zhangle, the leader of the first group of the second detachment of the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission's Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Team, and six others, confiscating two handguns and other items. Continuing the search, on May 24th, they raided the hidden places in the Concession and arrested 11 people, including the director of the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission's Shanghai Office and the leader of the Survey and Statistics Bureau's Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Team, Major General Mou, confiscating 12 guns, 1,439 rounds of ammunition, and one wireless radio. The organization was destroyed. It was found that they were directly under the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission and had created 22 terrorist incidents in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places since October 1940. The biggest reason why terrorist incidents in Shanghai seemed to have ended after June of last year was that the organization had been destroyed.</p>
<p>(2) Destroying the Loyalty and Salvation Army's Shanghai Action Team. On September 22nd and 24th of last year, the Shanghai Japanese Military Police reported the leader of the Shanghai Action Headquarters of the Loyalty and Salvation Army and 15 others in the two Concessions, confiscating handguns, bullets, wireless radios, and other items. They had bombed the Japanese Grand Hospital in Yangshupu on September 22nd. As for the key members of the Loyalty and Salvation Army, they were all arrested. The first action of the Action Headquarters was on May 18th, 1941, when they sniped at the deputy captain of the Shanghai Police Bureau's Detective Team, who died on the spot. In total, they carried out 12 sabotage and sniping operations.</p>
<p>There are many similar examples. They all confessed that "they had planned various terrorist acts, but because of strict vigilance, they had no way to start." Therefore, the conclusion can be said to be "strict vigilance will prevent terrorist incidents." All citizens of the city should remember the lessons learned in the past, and not be negligent in preventing and paying attention to the enemy who is always waiting for an opportunity, because the surface is calm. Not only companies, factories, theaters, etc., but all citizens of the city should defend themselves to prevent the enemy's conspiracy and jointly maintain the peace in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on the Unified Advancement of Charitable Undertakings</h3>
<p>Shanghai Poverty and Illness Relief Association, Wen Lantin, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng</p>
<p>The other day, I read an editorial in Shen Bao entitled "Charitable Undertakings Urgently Need Unified Advancement." It criticized current malpractices and was earnestly sincere, moving people. Because it mentioned the "Shanghai Poverty and Illness Relief Association" founded by Wen Lantin, Kanghou, Ludeng, etc., and expressed considerable expectations, Lantin, etc., cannot but express their views and thoughts on this issue. To answer Shen Bao and to discuss with advanced gentlemen of society and those enthusiastic about public welfare, if this can enable charitable undertakings to achieve ideal results in the future, then the nation and society will be fortunate.</p>
<p>(1) Discussion of Several Issues</p>
<p>Regarding the significance of unified advancement of charitable undertakings, the Shen Bao editorial has already explained it in detail, and there is no need to add more words. For all undertakings, if they want to develop and achieve results, they must be organized and planned. Moreover, charitable undertakings are undertakings for the people of society, and their scope is not the same as individual enterprises. Every action relates to millions of people. If there is no unified organization, detailed plan, and orderly steps, it is inevitable that the results will be halved with twice the effort, and it will delay the people and society. In the past, those who engaged in charitable undertakings were not lacking in loyal and capable people, and their achievements were remarkable, which cannot be denied. However, due to the lack of a unified organization and an overall plan, their efforts and achievements were either limited to one corner or limited to one time. Their spirit of conscientiousness and perseverance is admirable, but they have toiled for half their lives, endured hardships, and only achieved a little, unable to make a significant contribution to the country and society. Therefore, it is necessary to correct the long-standing drawbacks of scattered, fragmented, and independent actions, and unified advancement is necessary and urgent. However, unification is one thing, and advancement is another. How to unify and truly advance still requires careful study. This is the first point that Banting, etc., wish to propose for discussion.</p>
<p>In principle, there seems to be no problem with the unified advancement of charitable undertakings. However, who should unify and advance charitable undertakings? Recently, the term "totalitarianism" has been quite popular. The theory of centralization of power is especially rampant in wartime. In politics, military affairs, or economics, it may be necessary, but in charitable undertakings, does the so-called unified advancement have the same meaning? Lantin, etc., believe that charitable undertakings and politics, although they have the same goal by different routes, their motivation comes purely from compassion and indirect love among people. Therefore, it is expressed as action, which is entirely a social undertaking spontaneously and automatically initiated by the people. Its success or failure does not depend on government laws and regulations, but entirely on the conscience of mankind. Therefore, in essence, the so-called unified advancement seems to be initiated and tend towards unification by the people. We do not want to talk about the painful history of the failure of official undertakings and officially supervised civilian undertakings in the past few decades. Just the handling of charitable disputes requires a batch of specialized talents, which are accumulated over a long period of time and cannot be trained in any short-term class or special clause class. Therefore, the organization and talent for unified advancement seem to be worthy of careful study. This is the second point that Lan wants to propose for discussion.</p>
<p>If the principle of unified maintenance and advancement has been established, and the problem of unified advancement has also been solved, the next step is the problem of what can be unified and advanced, which urgently needs to be solved. For example, in terms of organization, whether a unified middle and small organization is needed for the unified advancement of charitable undertakings. In terms of institutions, whether a unified central institution or the most streamlined institution for the unified advancement of charitable undertakings is needed, what is the structure of such a precise constituent and organizational form, and what is the relationship with the government and the existing charitable and charitable organizations? This cannot be solved by simple principles. For example, a unified plan for advancing the unified advancement depends on the gathering of talents in the field, the start of investigation, research, and the progress of coordination work, and coordination with various parties. This is also the progress of Lianbao, and then it is possible to invite and establish the general purpose of certain works and the promotion of future charitable undertakings. Lanting and other places proposed to discuss the police.(Unfinished)</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Beyond Economic Issues: The Shanghai Price Surge</h3>
<p>"Stones from other hills can be used to polish jade." The other day, U.S. Food Administrator Davis said in a letter explaining his reasons for resigning: "If food supplies are not strictly controlled, I fear that inflation cannot be effectively controlled." - Recently, the price surge in Shanghai has become more and more intense. In exploring the root cause, the first is that the rice price surge is the center of all price surges, and the second is that gold worship also fuels the flames. In fact, this price surge is probably beyond economic issues and has become a kind of attempt with political implications. What is the so-called attempt? It is to make the currency form a more and more serious inflation, and the people's livelihood suffer more and more serious threats. As the Continental News said on July 4: "Recently, the increase in agricultural production is one of the reasons for the high prices, but the main reason is that speculative hoarders are intentionally spreading planned rumors about the recent political situation, hoping to promote a comprehensive price increase. This is a very obvious fact."</p>
<p>However, although the significance of promoting a comprehensive price increase is beyond economic issues, its method is always to use tools within the economic scope, and the most important ones are rice and gold. Therefore, we must first stimulate the surge in rice and gold. Based on the principle of "governing a chaotic country with severe penalties," the authorities, in order to maintain social order and connect the people's livelihoods, should act expediently and severely curb the irrational rise in rice and gold prices; and the most effective temporary countermeasure is to enforce price limits and give the most severe punishments without any tolerance. "Why should one family cry when the whole road can cry?" What is more preferable, the relative sobbing of speculators or the relative sobbing of ordinary citizens?</p>
<h3>Materials Control Review Committee: Meeting in Nanjing Today; President Tang of the General Chamber of Commerce Going to Nanjing to Attend</h3>
<p>The lower-level organizations of the National General Chamber of Commerce, the 22 Industry Joint Federation, and the four professional committees of the flour, wheat, oil, grain, sugar, cotton, and other industries, have all been successively organized. They have begun to supervise and guide the purchase, allocation, and operation of controlled materials, and organize small group meetings to jointly study and improve them. At the same time, in order to unify the system and take unified steps in the purchase and allocation of materials, it is reported that Mr. Tang Shoumin, President of the General Chamber of Commerce, will go to Nanjing by car to attend the meeting of the Materials Control Review Committee scheduled for this (6th) afternoon. In addition to reporting the organization of the lower-level organizations of the General Chamber of Commerce, he will also submit important proposals for the future direction of material control to the conference for discussion and implementation.</p>
<h3>Materials Investigation Committee: Starting Work Today; Chairman Chen Gives Speech</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Materials Investigation Committee has been actively preparing since its establishment on June 19. The investigators and offices of the committee will officially begin work today. Yesterday, Chairman Chen gave a speech, saying: "The main points of the committee's establishment have been seen in my speech published in the newspapers on June 22. Now, both the Chinese and Japanese investigators have been hired and will begin to perform their duties from today. In the future, I sincerely hope that the citizens will share the government's painstaking efforts to stabilize the people's livelihood and maintain society, cooperate with the committee, and report hoarding of materials and manipulation of prices so that they can be dealt with according to the law in order to complete the mission, stabilize prices, and stabilize the people's livelihood."</p>
<h3>Social Welfare Bureau: Adjusting Labor Organizations</h3>
<p>There are 248 labor organizations in this city that have been approved by the Social Movement Committee. After the Social Movement Committee was reorganized into the Social Welfare Bureau, in view of the fact that the organizations of various labor groups are not very sound due to the environment and other factors, the bureau specially ordered the third section in charge to formulate a statistical table of the general situation of trade unions, sent personnel to various trade unions to conduct on-site investigations, and ordered the persons in charge of each trade union to fill in the information in detail and submit it to the Social Welfare Department and the city government for detailed review by the Committee for the Review of Workers' Organizations. Those with unsound organizations will be adjusted. The review is now actively underway.</p>
<h3>Spring Cocoon Collection Coming to an End; Silk Factories Expedite Restarting Operations</h3>
<p>After the spring cocoons were launched in various spring cocoon producing areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year, silk merchants and firms in various places purchased spring cocoons from the producing areas in accordance with the official market price set by the authorities, and are preparing to resume silk production. More than 150 silk reeling factories in various places in China, such as Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Shanghai, have applied to the Special Donation Office for Sericulture Construction of the Ministry of Finance. Among them, small silk factories in Wuxi account for more than 80 percent. It is learned that a financial and industrial leading shareholding company in the city has successively transported new cocoons purchased from the producing areas to Shanghai, and has leased the former Yufeng Silk Factory as the company's first silk factory and the Lianyuan Silk Factory as the second silk factory. The two factories have about 300 silk looms. They are currently repairing the locomotives and will be able to start silk production within this month. The company has also established branches in Hangzhou and Wuxi to set up the third, fourth, and fifth silk factories, which will also start operations at the same time. It is reported that Hongda Silk Factory in this city has 240 looms and will also resume silk production within this month.</p>
<h3>Stock Market Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks generally stabilized after an initial dip. The trend was similar to that of gold prices, and overall market sentiment seemed relatively settled. After a brief period of uncertainty, most stocks eventually rose. The Yong'an Company in the department store sector experienced significant fluctuations, reversing a decline to achieve a gain. Xinxin's trading volume was low, making it easily manipulated by investors, resulting in rapid progress. Domestic goods recovered some lost ground. Innerwear stocks were at a critical point, and Fufu and Jinglun shirts were also trending upwards. The trading price of Guanghua Department Store was also high. Yong'an Textile briefly broke through a major resistance level before pulling back. Dasheng's No. 1 and No. 2 factories, as well as Dafeng and Rongfeng Textiles, showed persistent strength. Small-denomination Qimei Weaving and Da Zhonghua Weaving stocks were priced favorably. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity and Huashang Electric continued to rise. However, Da Zhonghua Fire Insurance saw its gains neutralized. In the cultural sector, Zhonghua Publishing remained stagnant. Commercial Press, World Book Company, and Yongxiang Printing were all gradually rising. In the pharmaceutical sector, Sino-French, Xin Ya, and Zhongxi all showed significant losses. Xinyi and Star Perfumery were firm. Jiuan Industrial, Tongyi Trust, Zhongxing Water &amp; Diesel, Defeng Knitting, and Kangyuan Canning all showed strong market performance.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of Various Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Coffee Shop Industry: The City Coffee Shop Industry Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday, the 5th, at the Jialei Coffee Shop. Xie, a inspector from the Grain Bureau, and Zhong Ying, a representative from the City Chamber of Commerce, attended to give guidance. The association's charter was approved on the spot, and directors were elected, including Li Yin, Shen Shunfu, etc., as directors, and Li Mancun and Huang Mingshun as supervisors.</p>
<p>Dim Sum Restaurant Industry: Since its establishment on the 25th of last month, the City Dim Sum Restaurant Industry Association has been actively promoting its affairs. In addition to handling membership registration for the industry, it is currently conducting a comprehensive registration of various raw materials required by the industry, such as flour, oil, and sugar. At the same time, it is separately contacting relevant agencies to seek a solution within a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Returning Concessions and Shanghai's Economic Problems (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Start by Stabilizing Prices</p>
<p>The National Government currently faces two important problems: one is the North China issue, and the other is the reorganization of Shanghai. Since the Greater East Asia War, efforts have been made to reorganize Shanghai. With the establishment of the Business Control Commission (商統會) and the signing of the agreement to return the Shanghai Public Concession, the framework is largely nearing completion. However, important political and economic issues still need to be addressed in the future. For example, the price problem, the hoarding problem, the Shanghai National Participation Council problem, and the streamlining of the Business Control Commission's lower-level organization all urgently need to be addressed. To be frank, Shanghai citizens have not yet deeply understood the historical significance of the so-called return of the concessions. In order to make epoch-making progress in Shanghai's politics and economy, the above-mentioned problems, especially the price problem, must be tackled with concentrated effort to solve and stabilize people's livelihood. Therefore, the current Shanghai economy must focus on people's livelihood issues.</p>
<p>Before the return of the concessions, economic problems were already very serious, and the return of the concessions has had a significant impact on the economy! This point cannot be ignored, and will be examined further below.</p>
<p>Unification of Politics and Economy</p>
<p>After the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai's economic circles, such as banks, enterprises, and other businesses, all had personal connections with important government figures. The relationship was merely a connection between economic figures and political figures, hoping to ensure the safety of their economic activities through this. And the personal connections between political figures and economic circles were to cultivate a foundation for their personal political power in Shanghai's economic circles. The direction of this kind of support was neither pure nor sound. For the sake of unified cooperation, it was a major obstacle. Fortunately, since this year, this kind of abnormal cooperation has transformed into a normal cooperative approach. There are probably the following points that are clearly evident: (1) Large-scale participation of representatives of Shanghai private capital in the National Economic Commission. (2) The full mobilization of national capital through the establishment of the private autonomous unified organization, the Business Control Commission. (3) The cooperation between the National Government and Shanghai's economic circles in financial institutions, such as the participation of private financial capitalists in the Central Reserve Bank's Advisory Council, the government's takeover of the clearing house, and the transformation of the Four Banks into joint public-private ventures. Among them, the most important is of course the Business Control Commission issue. The administrative authorities' supervisory power over the trade associations in the lower-level organization of the Business Control Commission is formally managed by the municipal government, but in reality, it is divided among several agencies. There are great difficulties in coordinating the guidance and supervisory agencies to deal with the price problem. These problems may all have the possibility of adjustment and resolution after the return of the concessions! (To be continued) (Yun Peng: from the July 5th Continental News)</p>

<h3>Life and Aspirations</h3>
<p>— Chuan Liu</p>
<p>Life is like a boat, and aspiration is its most important rudder. A heavy and stable boat must be equipped with a correct and balanced rudder in order to sail across the vast ocean, advancing with direction and purpose. Otherwise, it will drift aimlessly, without end. Conversely, having a correct rudder without a stable boat is also futile and impossible. Therefore, the two are interdependent. And isn't life the same? Aspiration is the giant wheel in life, powered by its original force and driving it forward. To put it clearly: if a person exists for a day, aspiration cannot be separated from them for a day.</p>
<p>Thus, aspiration and life have a close relationship with each other, and is what everyone needs and accepts. Therefore, to create a future career, one must start from the reality of truth and forge an aspiration as resilient as steel, then head towards the predetermined goal. I think there will be no experience of failure.</p>
<p>However, aspiration is not as easy to obtain as one might imagine. It is like a hunter hacking through thorns to catch their prey, because often, some people, when faced with a slight setback, inevitably become decadent, negative, pessimistic, and disappointed. This is the biggest drawback. If there were no disappointment, where would hope come from? Therefore, hope is forged from disappointment. For example, the many great inventors, scientists, and writers of modern times, did they shock the world with a single act? No one can deny this! It can be seen from this that success also comes from failure. However, they have an indomitable aspiration and a strong self-confidence to overcome any and all difficulties. Therefore, they have today's brilliant and radiant reputation, shining throughout the world. Isn't this the success of holding onto aspiration? So, aspiration is the foundation of life, and no one can destroy it! (Retribution)</p>
<h3>Chicken</h3>
<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>"It's already late. I have to go to the Huang family in Hedong to plead for help. I'm afraid the headquarters won't wait, and Ah Kun will definitely suffer tonight. Mrs. Ah Kun, do you have a field deed? Take it to pawn!" Chief Lu urged and came up with an idea.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Ah Kun, hurry! We can only use the field deed as collateral. There's no other way," Village Head Li encouraged.</p>
<p>Ah Kun's wife sobbed and, with trembling hands, brought a soybean oil lamp into the bedroom. Underneath the dressing box, she picked up a small, tattered blue package, opened it, took out a tightly folded piece of mulberry paper field deed, and handed it to Village Head Li. "Please take this field deed!"</p>
<p>Village Head Li took it and saw that it was a field deed for two and a half mu of land. He secretly calculated that this field deed would only fetch about six hundred yuan. He was afraid that it would not satisfy the desires of those thugs. Thinking of this, he said, "Mrs. Ah Kun, do you have any other field deeds at home? This...this...this one, I'm afraid...I'm afraid it's not enough. It won't fetch much money."</p>
<p>"Oh! Li Xingsheng, how much money do you need? I! My family only has this one field deed. There's nothing else. If this is not enough, then! Then what should I do? What should I do?" Ah Kun's wife's face became even paler, and she sobbed even more, unable to speak. Village Head Li listened, looked at Ah Kun's wife's face, turned his head, and stared blankly at Chief Lu for a long time.</p>
<p>"Let's try and see, Mr. Li. We also know that Ah Kun has been suffering too much. Where would he get another field deed? If it can't be done, we'll just have to chip in!" Chief Lu said to Village Head Li with great feeling.</p>
<p>"Alright! Let's go to the Huang family in Hedong first! Mrs. Ah Kun, don't worry. We're all old neighbors, and Ah Kun is a good man. We'll do our best to think of a way. At most, Ah Kun will come home tonight. You rest first!" Village Head Li, while putting the field deed into his pocket, comforted Ah Kun's wife, who was sobbing. He called to Chief Lu and walked out of Ah Kun's house. The color of the outside world was dim, and the late wind blowing on his face already had a hint of chill. The two quickened their pace and hurried towards Uncle Huang's house in Hedong. The Huang family was a wealthy family in the east of the town. Everyone called him Uncle Huang. His son was the district chief of this area, so the people nearby respected him very much. Uncle Huang was a very generous person, and was always willing to help his neighbors with any difficulties. However, these days, the area was not peaceful, and his son, who was the district chief, advised him not to meddle in other people's affairs, lest he cause trouble. Uncle Huang also stayed in seclusion and did not pay much attention to outside matters.</p>
<p>Village Head Li and the other arrived at the Huang family. Uncle Huang had already rested. His family's handyman, Ah Xu, was familiar with Village Head Li, so he let them in. After Li explained that he wanted to see Uncle Huang about an important matter, Ah Xu went in to report, and returned to let Li and Lu enter Uncle Huang's bedroom.</p>
<p>"Uncle Huang! Ah Kun from Hexi, somehow, was arrested by the town's headquarters, accusing him of communicating with bandits and hiding guns, a very serious crime. Uncle! You also know that Ah Kun is usually honest and kind, and would never do such a thing. But these days, if you come empty-handed, you don't have the right to speak. When you mention the word 'wronged,' you'll be slapped in the face first. To put it bluntly, this is just to scare you, and what they really want is money. Uncle, are you right? But Ah Kun can't even get enough to eat, where would he get the money? We thought about it and decided to ask Uncle to help us borrow some money. Here's Ah Kun's field deed as collateral. The amount on the field deed is very small, so we'll have to ask Uncle to make a special exception!" Village Head Li sincerely pleaded with Uncle Huang, took out the tightly folded field deed from his pocket, and handed it to Uncle Huang. (4)</p>
