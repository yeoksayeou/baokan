<h3 id="c1">谈安定物價 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>物價問題依然是目前最重要的問題之一。這個問題如果沒有澈底的解決辦法，那麼上自國家財政的收支，下至人民日常的生活，無不受其嚴重壓迫。一般中下級公務人員，敎職員和其他依薪資爲生的工作人員，固然因物價日增，有難安職位之勢。即如掌握物資的農，工，商各界，也不免因爲「水漲船高」而有前途茫茫的感覺。同時，物價問題一天不獲妥善的解決，更在社會上造成一種普遍的恐慌的心理，這種心理，又反而助長了物價問題的嚴重性，搆成物價問題的主要因素之一。這種現象，目前還在和平區內特別是上海等處發展着，瞻念前途，實有不能不令人作「堤破水決」的杞憂。中日當局，會作爲重要課題而籌謀解決之道，即以上海而論，租界當局曾有專門研究物價對策的組織，而今後似乎還有全面管理的趨勢，我們乘此時機，特向當局與社會各界進言如左：</p>
<p>無論任何問題，如果不依據社會的實際情形和實際需要，也就是說，一切政策如果不能獲得社會各界的了解和擁護，就不會獲得完善的結果。中國社會，固然散漫無力，然而正因爲其散漫無力，形成一種離心的力量，往往使政府當局的政策不能收到預期的效果。這一點表現在物價問題上最爲明顯。所以，切對策，決不能僅恃政府當局的一紙文吿所能收效，必須做到朝市同心，官民合作，才能順利進行，收到善果。所以我們對於物賈問題的處理，希望充分做到這一點，一面由當局召集工商產業界及有關人士，會商切實有效的辦法，從而頒有限制和管理的法令期能統一嚴正地執行。一面由社會各界發起饗應政府當局安定物價的運動，利用各業組織，擴大宣傳，發揮民間力量，協同動作，在因勢疏導與合理調整之中，施行嚴格管理和制裁的法令，所謂眞理闡揭於前，政權盾之於後，然後能望「令無不行，禁無不止」，物價問題，才有澈底解決的希望。這是希望於政府當局與社會各界領袖應合力以謀解決的第一點。</p>
<p>當前的物價問題，不是局部的問題，它是普遍於一切部門和一切地區的。所以，對於物價的管理，雖然仍應有綏急輕重的分別。可是，一般的說，決不能是枝枝節節的解決，也不能採「各個擊破」的辦法，而必須在整個的政策之下，作全面的處理，尤共是政府當局方面有關管理物價的各機構或各部門，必須通力合作，切實負責，特別是要在一定期間內（期間不可太短）堅決聲明：（一）對於公營的郵電，交通公用事業及公營生產原料物品的價格，以及各項捐稅之征率，宣告不再增加。（二）對於生產攸關的糧食及其他重要物資，限制共全部價格，不再上漲。（三）對於租賃價率與市塲利率予以穩定，不再變動。同時，工鑛各業的生產品，也就可能不再加價了。至於各業中如因特殊情形，偶有成本不敷，或不及法定利潤情事，自然應該由政府當局仿照各國先例，予以補助，或准予酌加，以資維持。這是有望於政府當局於工礦生產者和商界協力以實現物價之全面的安定措置的第二點。</p>
<p>一切經濟設施，應以物價爲中心，以圖興革。物價變動，旣以物資來源與通貨數量爲其起因，而人心動搖，益成汜濫之勢，則欲謀穩定，必須盡一切可能以赴之，凡足以使物資增加，通貨收縮及回籠，及使人心安定者，都應竭力推行。凡足以使物資减少，通貨增加及使人心不安者，都應竭力制止之。我們敢就見聞所及，竭誠以貢獻於政府者：</p>
<p>（一）對於國營公營及日方資本經營的生產及公用事業，應有整個計劃，應明白規定。其應歸民營的，更須指定事業範圍，盡量獎助人民經營，以期奠定我國戰時尤其是戰後生產的基礎。此外，如寬貸資金，保護稅制等政策的實施，也屬於刻不容緩的事</p>
<p>（二）對於公私生產設備，應該開始進行澈底的調整，互通有無，互補盈絀，並嚴限不必要的擴張及添置，以期節的物力。「尤望日本企業家方面，以遠大的眼光，協助中日兩國長期的合作，在技術方面，多給中國企業家以協助。而對於一切、「大魚吃小魚」的現象，允力求其永不發生。這樣不僅在經濟上，甚至在政治上，也都有重大的意義。而在目前允可收充分動員生產力量的效率。</p>
<p>（三）對於戰時軍需及安定國民生活必需的物資，除了應該獎助中小生產以外，尤應多方面的獎勵購運，在統制，檢查，及稅收制度中，如有足以妨礙生產，阻滯運輸，甚至於米免發生助長囤積之反作用者，應該會同中日雙方關係當局與中國社會上工商各界領袖，隨時妥議修改或廢除，以期增加物力。那就不只是爲了解決物價問題而已了。</p>
<p>（四）對於市塲游資，應指導證券市塲，使爲無害而有利的活動，以减輕對物價的壓力。同時，對於通貨，還可在必要時實行限制法力量，如大數償付，、須用支票轉賬，以節省鈔券的消耗，而限制非法交易及非法授受。</p>
<p>最後，比較也是最重要的，是要努力糾正人心，政府在維持其合理的通貨發行額時，應該隨時或定期公布通貨之安定及物資的供應情形，以堅定社會人心，破除人民恐慌心理，而安穩了市塲的物價。此外，對於全面統制物價，及取締囤積居奇的動因，改善檢查之執行辦法，允應廣事宣傳，使執行人員及社會各界知所守戒。</p>
<p>也許我們的獻議，還是老生常談，然而我們認定，這些都是安定物價的必要條件。務望當局與社會各界注意及之。</p>

<p>（里斯本四日每日新聞報特派員佐倉）去年底繼西班牙葡萄牙二國會談之德意法三國會談，一到今年年初，德國迅即發表其更迭駐西班牙及瑞典之大使，歐洲政界之動態，於此乃有新的進展。新春初頭歐洲政局之展望，在軸心方面、頗示好況，而德國駐西班牙大使之更迭，隨北非新情勢之進展，對於益增其重要性之伊比里亞半島之動向，將展開新構想之外交政策，尤堪注目。</p>
<p>歐洲政界之主動力在於德國，自不待言；而國際政治之動向，則有其現實背景。美英雖由侵入法屬非洲而獲得軍事的先發制人之優勢，然而德國則出以如此之方策，即一方面在非洲分化反軸心軍作戰計畫，拖住美英軍隊於非洲；一方面在此期間，充分鞏固歐洲，使敵之作戰完全停頓。然則歐洲之政治的動向，自去年底以來，究有如何之展開？則巴爾幹與北歐（然有所謂中立國之瑞典）可謂大體已見鞏固矣。</p>
<p>此等諸國之中，羅馬尼亞已由安德納斯哥總理使其政策作一百八十度之轉變；敗於德國諸國中，挪威則由葵士林總理之領導，最先奔上了重建之途，故該兩國由政治的觀點言之，蓋已非常納粹化矣。芬蘭與匈牙利，其國內之政策，雖未必納綷化，然而該兩國對德之協力，則並未因之稍變。在匈總理加來與芬總統里蒂之演說，及德國對彼之反響中，均顯露着相互諒解之誠意。美英欲在　國內之政策上，使納粹主義與各該國文化性格對立，以作施展其陰謀之工具，此種陳舊手法，顯然已不能通用。</p>
<p>意外長齊亞諾與法總理賴伐爾，同被邀赴德國後所開之德意法會談，分爲德意之軍事的會談，與德意對法之政治的會談兩組，美英過於輕視意大利之確固的戰爭決意，自侵入法屬北非開始作戰以來，雖屢施其反法西斯分子爲目標之種種謀略，伸張其離間軸心之魔手，然而德意會談結果，兩國於攻守上之軍事的一體化之諒解，則已更趨強化。現在德軍與意軍，不分彼此，並肩作戰，德國之軍隊與軍需品，正陸繼進入意國，故美英對於意國之政治的謀略，其活動餘地，至此亦已完全消失，至其與法總理伐爾之會談內容，當如下示：</p>
<p>德意法議和條件之決定；</p>
<p>法國對軸心之協力；</p>
<p>法國之新軍隊編制及其與軸心之軍事的協定；</p>
<p>貝當賴伐爾政府之強化。</p>
<p>關於議和條件，姑置勿論，總之，和平條約成立之可能性，已驟然擴大。又關於　　　項之問題，其担當折衝者，自屬賴伐爾總理，故將來必能使賴伐爾總理與迪亞，杜里奧兩氏握手，消除巴黎與維希之對立，使全部法國本土，得與軸心携手。此事現雖有法國單一政黨之組成問題，及新軍隊之編制與其活用問題，然前者爲巴黎派所主張，可由其與賴伐爾總理之諒解，由賴伐爾任黨魁而不難解決。至於後者，則並非如目下出現於蘇聯戰綫上三色旗隊之志願兵制度，而爲徴兵制，在與德軍協力之下，担任巴爾幹及烏克蘭佔領地之警備，俾德軍之餘額開赴第一綫上，此種辦法，當可認爲最切實者，德國對之必將與以充分之援助。達蘭一派之暴露真相，可謂對於軸心，對於歐洲，其結果反見有利。美英欲以法蘭西爲歐洲之對德攻擊根據地，此種謀策，因此終告失敗。</p>
<p>最後來一述伊比里亞半島之問題，該半島上之西葡兩國，同爲在現今戰局中保守中立者。目前西班牙之對軸心關係，葡萄牙之對美英關係，以爲得其均衡者，實屬錯誤，西班牙固可謂爲對軸心協力之一員，然而葡萄牙亦並非美英陣營中之一員。因此美英對於伊比里亞之工作，乃趨激化。爲西班牙計，應不使葡萄牙成爲美英之犧牲，實爲必要之圖。此次會談，據謂係應西班牙總統弗郎哥將軍之要求而舉行者，然而該兩國之關係，自斯耐爾外長當時，固已大見好轉。葡萄牙以維持中立爲其國策之中心者；對於由伊比里亞集團以維持其中立，當不致有所異議（立譯）</p>

<h3 id="c76">再谈蘇秦 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 賈新生</p>
<p>關於蘇秦，前文意猶未盡，現在再來談談。</p>
<p>史記裏記載蘇秦路過洛陽得意的情景時，在「…此一人之身，富貴則親戚畏懼之，貧賤則輕易之，况衆人乎？」下面，接着這兩句話：</p>
<p>「日使我有洛陽負郭田二頃，吾豈能佩六國相印乎？」</p>
<p>道兩句話仍是蘇秦說的。蘇秦之爲人，本文仍不欲具論。我們只覺得這兩句話，實含有深刻的意義。</p>
<p>假如蘇秦果有了洛陽負郭田二頃，生活當然優裕。生活優裕了，還肯動什麽腦筋？說秦王，說趙王那些事，蘇秦的一生壓根兒就不會有。倡「合縱」之說，或終有其人，但絕不會是蘇秦。佩六國相印或終有其人，但也絕不會是蘇秦。</p>
<p>蘇秦是「窮巷掘門桑戶棬樞之士」，當他未說秦王前，眼見那些有洛陽負郭田二頃之人，未嘗不嫉羨。當他說秦王書十上而說不行，落魄歸來的時候，眼見那些有洛陽負郭田二頃之人，未嘗不眼熱。假如在他引錐自刺其股」的時候，忽然投機發了大財，有了負郭田二頃，我想，蘇秦或竟放棄說趙王之念，而就一輩子享受大地主之福了。</p>
<p>到了佩相印，路過洛陽，覺得自己的地位遠非那些洛陽大地主可以比擬，蘇秦躊躇滿志，才說出這兩句話：「且使我有洛陽負郭田二頃，吾豈能佩六國相印乎？」蘇秦到道時，是他個人主義的黄金時代，「於是散千金以賜宗族朋友」。那時宗族朋友之羨慕蘇秦，以自己不如蘇秦而暗悔，以效法蘇秦而勉勵子弟；那是可以想像出來的。至於見蘇秦富貴而嫉妬者，或對蘇秦爲人不贊成者，當然希望穌奏早日失敗，或盼望六國「合縱」會不成功，或甚至希望秦國出兵，滅去六國；這樣錯綜複雜的心理，也是可以想像出來的。</p>
<p>中外歷史，充滿着英雄豪傑的紀載。這些英雄豪傑們，當未發　時，的確很少是有「負郭田二頃的」。因此，每到他們個人成功的時候，常不期然而然地，發出類乎蘇秦所說的「且使我有洛陽負郭田二頃，吾豈能佩六國相印乎？一　語，表示自己的得意　偉大。</p>
<p>類乎蘇秦等之成功，當然有賴於個人之才能和努力，不過大都也由環境所使然。這批「英雄」們，適逢時會成功之後，郤常予智自雄，以「超人」自居。而有所求於他的人，則更把他神化，捧到三十三天。從此，天下多事矣！</p>
<h3 id="c77">關于徵文 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 棄疾</p>
<p>讀本報徵文前言，內有「年齡最髙的（指應徵的）六十四歲，最小爲十二歲」等語，令人肅然起敬，這位六十四歲的老翁，不知是否卽名列第二等的賈粟香先生，因爲我知道賈先生也是六十開外的老先生了。賈先生是一位知名的前輩教育家，就常情而論，像他這樣資格這樣髙年的人，往往不肯去應徵什麽微文之類，和後生小子爭一日之短長的。這種地方，我們中國人最講究面子，以為萬一落了選，好像久戰沙場的大將，一旦敗於無名小卒之手，豈不貽笑大方。現在賈先生獨能打破這種成見，毅然應徵，這次固然是中了選，依普通人看來，是沒有失面子；然而我猜想他就是落了選，也決不會懊惱，或者覺得自己從此無顏見人的。</p>
<p>我們知道應徵是一件事，中選落選又是一件事；如其怕落選而不應徵，則誰能保險必定中選，結果豈不是沒有人敢應微了嗎？賈先生看透了這一點，所以無論中選落選，他是決不介意的。這種精神，眞足爲後輩的楷式，叫我們萬事衹應勇往直前的幹去，不應多所顧慮，我和賈先生素不相識，寫這篇文字的目的，並不是要頌揚他個人，只爲欽佩他的精神，故表而出之，旣以自勉，亦以勉諸位讀者。</p>
<h3 id="c78">萬世師表 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Jameg　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>全體敎職員都反對這個主張，學校如果發表牠的意見時，大槪也是反對的。大家都相信，東部的孩干都是小流氓，否則他們就只好被弄得拘拘束束，不舒服；不論怎樣，一定會有『意外』發生，大家都要被攪得亂七八糟，大不開心。但是加　鄰還堅持着。</p>
<p>『吉普斯』，她說，「他們都錯的，你知道，而我是對的。我在預向着將來看，而你和他們則在回頭向着以往看。英國不是永遠會被分成官家世族和「其他階級」的。那些柏普拉（Poplar）的孩子對於英國，正和勃洛克菲爾德一般地重要。你應該請他們來的，吉普斯。要是說你只簽幾個幾尼（guinea）的支票給他們，而不肯和他們接近，你就不能滿足你的良心。還有，他們也以勃洛克菲爾德爲光榮—正和你一樣。若干年後，也許那樣的孩千會到這　來—無論如何，其中幾個人總會來的。爲什麽不呢？爲什麽一直不呢？吉普斯，親愛的，記好，這是一九九七年—一九六七年，你到劍橋的那一年。你所獲得的觀念都是深深地黏着於那些日子的，牠們也都是良好的觀念，爲數很多。但是少數－不過少數，吉普斯—却不能再黏着了。…」</p>
<p>也許可以說出於她的意外，他竟順從了，突然熱心地贊成那個提議，於是局面大變，以致當局者出於不意，覺得只好同意於那種危險的實騐。柏普拉的兒童在一個星期六的下午，到了勃洛克菲爾德，和學校的乙組足球隊比賽，結果是七比五，雖敗猶榮，比賽後和學校隊在膳堂裏一同吃有肉食的茶點。然後他們見了校長，被領着參觀了全校，傍晚，吉普斯在火車站上送他們動身。各事順利地經過，毫無任何牽扯，顯然，來賓所帶去的正如他們所留下的一棵，同是良好的印象。（十四）</p>
<h3 id="c79">評李少春的「洗浮山」 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>李少春此次重在天蟾出演，叫座能力必佳，早在我意料之中，因他文戲武戲全演得不壞，並且肯賣氣力，每演又是雙齣重頭戲故也。他第三　演洗浮山，小友陳君的我往觀，觀竟頗爲滿。少春扮賀天保，載軟羅帽，穿褶子，足踏薄底快靴，掛黑三，和施公案戲中計全打扮一樣，背上多出雙刀，此乃普通英雄裝束，而在少春扮來，出塲盪馬，一招一式，都覺邊式，要馬鞭，甩髯口，全有分寸，可證他的工夫純熟。後入浮山，與盜黨幾塲開打，雙刀使得圓穩淸楚，腿底下有地方，快而不火，慢而不瘟，每决亮相，都佾麗的很，不大雷同，好在脫了武生的野氣。有人說他武戲不如傳德威結實，我不敢贊同，傳是純粹武生，好處是勇健，李的玩藝是武戲文演，另是一種傳授，勁道不同。好比拳術，傳是少林派，李是武當派，固然都好，而取逕不同也。聽說少春的武工得自李永利，永利的玩藝，得之楊小樓，小樓學河南陳家　子陳家的嫡派太極拳，我所親眼得見，太極即武當內家拳，講究內剛外柔。小樓能够武戲文演，得力在此，若說少春得於余叔岩親授，此乃欺人之談，我不敢信。無論叔岩臥病多年，懶得動彈，又拿藝衛當寳貝，不肯傳人，即令叔岩肯親敎少春，還怕到不了道個地步哩。現在再說少春的唱法，我聽他唱賀天保陰魂託夢的正二簧反二簧幾段，覺得他的嗓音雖然不錯，論唱法還不到火候，字眼還不能十分淸晰，唱腔還不能十分穩練。我素來主張「唱法難於武工，文戲難於武戲，」請看科　中一個小孩童，不到幾年，武工武戲，就可以將就看看，及至唱文戲，簡直不能入耳，這是一個鐵證。少春練戲，已經有了十多年的歲月，武戲很可觀了，但唱法還差着一個塔頂，掉句文話，「爲山九仭，功虧一簣，」我希望少春把唱法再追求一下，好成一位文武全材。至於純武生戲，還是少演爲妙，出汗過多，於嗓音是不利的。少春前幾天曾下顧敝齋一次，看他臉上很靜穆，眼神也內歛，是一位極有希望的靑年藝人，或許能容納我的芻言。</p>

<p>— Lineoln　Schuster著　古心譯</p>
<p>前因</p>
<p>下面的短簡，講到水銀柱上壓力的惻量，事情很簡單，看起來也許要覺得沒有趣味，但是牠却指出了科學硏究的眞正精神，所以我們也不能不選到牠。這位著名的科學家，巴斯噶（Blaise　Pascal）是法國的神秘學家，哲學家，和算學家，他在這短簡中顯出他怎樣「將他的思想用之於嚴格的探索和實騐的同工。」</p>
<p>巴斯噶生於一六二三年，他的作品中最著名的是」思想論」（Pensees），一八五〇年譯成了英文，稱爲「宗敎與基督敎事跡的思想論」（Thoughts　on　Religion　andEvidences　of　Chlistisnity）。不過他在科學界也一樣地有名，他是現代或然學說的首創者，巴斯噶三角形的發明者，而在微分學的進步上，他也有所貢獻。他的科學工作在氣壓測量方面，也是重要的。他的實騐加增了大氣壓力和液體平衡的知識。</p>
<p>他曾預言過「那種簡單而平常的事實，就是說，山頂上的空氣壓力要比底下谷中的壓力小」，他以爲只有藉着實騐，他的預言才能够被證實或被駁倒。因此他對他的（姊）妹夫（或妻兄弟）潘里厄（Florin　Perier）寫了下面的信：</p>
<p>「……用物理學的種種問題來煩　着你……」</p>
<p>本文</p>
<p>我冒昧地來打斷你日常的專門勞作，用物理學的種種問題來煩擾着你，因爲我知道，牠們會在你閒暇的時候給你休自與消遣。……現在的問題是有關於著名的實騐的，就是用一枝灌滿水銀的管子，先放在山脚下，後放在山頂上，在同天之內，這樣放過幾次，以便確定：水銀柱的髙度，在這兩種情形之下，是否相同或相異。……因爲在山脚下的空氣，要比在山頂上的重得多，這是一定的。</p>
<p>後果</p>
<p>差不多在一年之後，一六四八年九月二十二日，巴斯噶從潘里厄那裏接到了這樣的回信：</p>
<p>「我終於作成了你早已期望着的實騐。…在譜伊得多謨（Poy-de-Dome）山的頂上，…我們看見管子裏的水銀是二三·二吋，而在山下寺院的花園裏時，管子上是二六·二五吋。管中水銀在兩處的髙度，其相差爲三·一五吋。這事使我們大爲驚奇與佩服。」</p>
<p>巴斯噶死於一六六二年八月。（本篇完）社會服務</p>

<h3 id="e1">Talking About Stabilizing Prices <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The price issue remains one of the most important issues at present. If this problem is not thoroughly resolved, then from the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure to the people's daily lives, all will be severely oppressed. Ordinary middle and lower-level civil servants, teachers, and other staff who rely on salaries for a living are indeed finding it difficult to secure their positions due to rising prices. Even the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors that control materials cannot avoid feeling lost due to the "rising tide lifts all boats." At the same time, if the price issue is not properly resolved for a day, it will create a general sense of panic in society, and this psychology will, in turn, contribute to the severity of the price issue, constituting one of the main factors of the price problem. This phenomenon is still developing in peaceful areas, especially in places like Shanghai. Looking ahead, it is truly impossible not to feel the anxieties of "a breach in the dam leads to a flood." The Chinese and Japanese authorities will take it as an important issue and plan solutions. Even in Shanghai, the concession authorities have specialized organizations to study price countermeasures, and in the future, there seems to be a trend toward comprehensive management. We take this opportunity to offer the following advice to the authorities and all sectors of society:</p>
<p>No matter what problem, if it is not based on the actual situation and actual needs of society, that is, if all policies cannot gain the understanding and support of all sectors of society, it will not achieve perfect results. Chinese society is indeed scattered and weak, but precisely because of its scattered and weak nature, it forms a centrifugal force, which often prevents the government's policies from achieving the desired effect. This is most evident in the price issue. Therefore, all countermeasures must not rely solely on a document from the government authorities to be effective. It must be done with the unity of the court and the market, and the cooperation of officials and people, in order to proceed smoothly and achieve good results. Therefore, we hope to fully achieve this point in the handling of the price issue. On the one hand, the authorities should convene industry, commerce, production, and related people to discuss practical and effective methods, and then issue laws and regulations for restrictions and management to ensure unified and strict implementation. On the other hand, all sectors of society should launch a movement to respond to the government's efforts to stabilize prices, use various industry organizations to expand publicity, exert the power of the people, and cooperate in action. In the process of guiding and reasonably adjusting according to the situation, implement strict management and sanctions laws, so that the truth is clarified in front, and the government's power protects it from behind. Then it can be hoped that "orders will be carried out, and prohibitions will be stopped," and the price issue will have the hope of a thorough solution. This is the first point that we hope the government authorities and leaders of all sectors of society should work together to solve.</p>
<p>The current price issue is not a local issue, it is universal to all departments and all regions. Therefore, although the management of prices should still have distinctions between urgency and importance, in general, it must not be solved piecemeal, nor can it adopt the method of "divide and conquer," but must be handled comprehensively under the entire policy. In particular, various institutions or departments of the government authorities related to price management must cooperate closely and be truly responsible. In particular, it is necessary to firmly declare within a certain period (the period should not be too short): (1) Declare that the prices of state-owned postal, telecommunications, transportation public utilities, and state-owned production raw materials, as well as the tax rates of various taxes, will no longer be increased. (2) Restrict the total prices of food and other important materials related to production so that they will no longer rise. (3) Stabilize rental rates and market interest rates so that they will no longer change. At the same time, the products of various industries such as industry and mining may no longer be increased in price. As for the various industries, such as those due to special circumstances, occasionally there is insufficient cost, or the situation of not reaching the statutory profit, the government authorities should naturally follow the precedents of various countries, give subsidies, or allow appropriate additions to maintain it. This is the second point that is expected from the government authorities to cooperate with industrial and mining producers and the business community to achieve a comprehensive stabilization measure of prices.</p>
<p>All economic facilities should be centered on prices to seek innovation and reform. Since price fluctuations are caused by the source of materials and the quantity of currency, and the shaking of people's hearts has become a widespread trend, then to seek stability, we must do everything possible to go to it. All things that can increase materials, shrink and recall currency, and stabilize people's hearts should be vigorously promoted. All things that can reduce materials, increase currency, and make people uneasy should be vigorously stopped. We dare to contribute sincerely to the government as far as we have seen and heard:</p>
<p>(1) The state-owned, public-owned, and Japanese-capital-operated production and public utilities should have a whole plan, which should be clearly stipulated. Those that should be privately operated should be designated for the scope of the business, and people should be encouraged to operate as much as possible, in order to lay the foundation for our country's wartime, especially post-war, production. In addition, the implementation of policies such as generous loans and protection of the tax system are also matters of urgency.</p>
<p>(2) The public and private production equipment should be thoroughly adjusted, share what they have and make up for what they lack, and strictly limit unnecessary expansion and additions, in order to save material resources. "Especially hope that Japanese entrepreneurs, with a long-term vision, will assist the long-term cooperation between China and Japan, and give Chinese entrepreneurs more assistance in terms of technology. As for all the phenomena of "big fish eat small fish," allow to strive for its never occurrence. This is of great significance not only in economics, but even in politics. And at present, it allows to receive the efficiency of fully mobilizing the power of production.</p>
<p>(3) For the materials needed for wartime military supplies and stable national life, in addition to encouraging small and medium-sized production, more encouragement should be given to purchase and transport. In the control, inspection, and tax system, if there are factors that hinder production, obstruct transportation, or even inevitably have the opposite effect of promoting hoarding, the relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities and leaders of the industrial and commercial circles in Chinese society should discuss and revise or abolish them at any time, in order to increase material resources. That is not just to solve the price problem.</p>
<p>(4) For market floating funds, guide the securities market to make it a harmless and beneficial activity, in order to reduce the pressure on prices. At the same time, for currency, restrictive legal forces can also be implemented when necessary, such as large-value payments, which must be transferred by check, in order to save the consumption of banknotes and restrict illegal transactions and illegal acceptance.</p>
<p>Finally, and comparatively the most important, is to strive to correct people's hearts. When the government maintains its reasonable amount of currency issuance, it should announce the stability of currency and the supply of materials at any time or regularly, in order to strengthen the hearts of society, break the people's panic psychology, and stabilize the prices in the market. In addition, for the comprehensive control of prices and the elimination of the motives for hoarding, and improving the implementation of inspection methods, it should be widely publicized so that the executive personnel and all sectors of society know what to abide by.</p>
<p>Perhaps our proposals are still platitudes, but we believe that these are necessary conditions for stabilizing prices. I hope the authorities and all sectors of society will pay attention to them.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Desert Battle Ends German Troops Hold New Defense Line British Eighth Army Splits into Two Routes to Advance Westward Italian and French Troops in Southern Libya Make Contact <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th, Allied News Agency - According to British sources last night, German troops in North Africa, after containing the British Eighth Army for several days in the Wadi Zemzem area of Libya, were reportedly rushing to build defenses in an easily defensible valley area inland. They have now suddenly retreated to this new defense line on Friday night. However, this news has not yet been confirmed by Berlin and Rome. Yesterday's Italian Supreme Command war report only stated that there was fierce artillery fire on the front line. The British Middle East Command stated that the Eighth Army had been fighting fiercely with the enemy in the Sedada and Bir Taa areas. According to military experts here, if the British news is true, the North African sand-Han battle has ended. The German African Army is stubbornly resisting in the mountainous area of ​​Tripolitania. As for the Tunisian battle, the Allied forces said there was no change.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 18th, Reuters - The British military headquarters in Cairo announced that the British Eighth Army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Axis forces in North Africa. The Allied forces have forced the Axis forces to engage in the Bir Taa area.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 18th, Reuters - British war correspondent Ham said that the purpose of the new offensive launched by the British in North Africa is not to seek progress, but only to annihilate the Axis forces before they join forces with General Arnim's troops in Tunisia. According to the Baizhong report received from London after the launch of the offensive, the British army launched the offensive in Tripolitania at 7:00 am on the 15th, and immediately encountered strong resistance from the Axis forces. The mines buried by the Axis forces along the way greatly hindered the progress of the British army. It is reported that the British army occupied Wadi Zemzem on the morning of the 16th, and it is heard that Meng Gaomolai advanced in two routes, one route along the coastal area, and one route passed through Wadi Zemzem to Fudada.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 17th, Havas News Agency - According to news from both the Axis and Allied countries, there were no major changes on the Tunisian front in North Africa yesterday, only air force activities. In addition, several Italian submarines entered the port of Algiers. There were still scout activities on the front lines, especially near Goblett and the Fontac area of ​​Kairouan. At the same time, Italian troops in southern Libya made contact with French separatist troops from Lake Chad. According to the Cairo radio station, the British Eighth Army attacked near Seteda on the morning of the 15th, sixty English heavy, seventy-five miles south of Mizorata. The British gazette believes that "the desert battle has ended." The British army engaged with the Axis forces in the mountains of a small gorge, where the Axis forces are easy to defend.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th, Allied News Agency - According to the British Middle East Command announced yesterday, the Tegor unit, commanded by General Leclerc, has made contact with the left wing of the British Eighth Army. The army has mechanized units and camel teams. The original French car was attacking Italian troops in southern and central Libya.</p>
<p>Italian Navy Uses Midget Submarines to Launch Surprise Attack on Port of Algiers</p>
<p>Rome, 18th, Reuters - The assault ship mentioned in the Italian military report that attacked the port of Algiers is shaped like a water frog. This new weapon first appeared in Souda Bay before the Axis forces occupied Crete, and was subsequently used continuously in Malta, Gibraltar, and the port of Alexandria. When the ship attacked Algiers, it sailed straight to the entrance of the port unnoticed because the ship could submerge in the water like an ordinary submarine. The ship then sneaked to the bow of the ship parked in the port, placed a special agricultural timed bomb, and immediately left quickly. When the crew heard the explosion, the assault ship was safely in the sea. In this way, a total of two merchant ships were sunk, and a cruiser and a merchant ship were severely damaged. This assault ship was invented by Italians and built in Italy. The ship has only two crew members and is equipped with a silent engine, and even specially made sound detectors cannot detect its sound. Thousands of Italian officers and soldiers are currently volunteering to serve on the ship. The qualifications of its crew members must be young people under the age of thirty-two and proficient in swimming.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Military Committee Chairman Wang's Letter to the Officers and Soldiers <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>At 10:00 am on January 9 this year, the National Government, based on the consistent spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, officially announced its participation in the Greater East Asia War and signed the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration with friendly Japan, stating that in order to complete the joint war against Britain and the United States and defeat the common enemy, the two governments, with unwavering determination and belief, will fully cooperate in military, political, and economic affairs. At the same time, it also signed agreements on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. The national father's forty years of efforts in revolution, the desire to abolish unequal treaties, and the words recorded in his deathbed will, have finally been realized today. From now on, China will stand in an independent, autonomous, and completely free position, and cooperate with its East Asian neighbors and friendly countries around the world, and step into the united front of defending the Greater East Asia War. The significance of this is unprecedented in our country's history, and the arduousness of the tasks undertaken by our soldiers standing on the front lines of the Greater East Asia War is a hundredfold greater than in the past. I will list a few points to tell my comrades-in-arms:</p>
<p>In the past hundred years, the British and American imperialists, based on their ferocious faces and using vicious means, have carried out political, economic, cultural, military, and other aspects of aggression against our East Asian nations, and have巧取豪奪（stolen by trickery and force） for a long time. Since the Opium War, our country has been infringed upon and forced to sign various unequal treaties, resulting in its沦於次殖民地（falling into a semi-colonial status）. Devouring blood and shedding tears, historical traces are斑斑（full of traces）, and every review is deeply hair-raising. The friendly country Japan, on December 8 of the year before last, because it deeply felt the urgency of the entire East Asian nation's demand for liberation, resolutely launched the Greater East Asia War, devoting its national strength to clear the brutal forces of Britain and the United States occupying East Asia, and attempting to build a new order in Greater East Asia, echoing the efforts of the German and Italian Axis to build a new order in Europe, in order to contribute to the entire peace of the world. We should know the significance of the Greater East Asia War, which is to represent the spirit of Eastern righteousness, based on the belief of co-existence and co-prosperity of East Asian nations, and rise up to extinguish the remnants of hegemonic imperialism produced by Western utilitarianism, which are横流於世界之餘毒（flooding the world）. The victory of justice and power, the oppressed against the oppressors, all depend on the efforts of this war to achieve it. When the national father was alive, he昭示吾人（told us） that if we want to revive China and defend East Asia, we can only implement the Three People's Principles and Pan-Asianism. The national father knew from the beginning that if China wants to achieve freedom and equality, it must wait for the entire liberation of the East Asian nation. Now the National Government resolutely announced its participation in the Greater East Asia War, which is to realize the national father's fervent hope of Pan-Asianism. This is indeed a great mission entrusted to us by history. The Chongqing regime is僻處西陲（remotely located in the western border）, jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's ruling area, and deceived by the威脅利誘之迷夢（threats and temptations） of British and American empires. It does not hesitate to join the so-called British and American front and practice the brutality of East Asians killing East Asians. Recently, it has變本加厲（become even more serious）, sending troops to Burma and India on the one hand, and妄藉敵機轟炸（wantonly bombing） our Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other areas with enemy planes on the other hand, constantly invading, attempting to阻擾我和平建設之進行（obstruct the progress of our peaceful construction）. It跡共用心（the trace is a common intention）, actually甘爲東亞建設之破壞者（willing to be the destroyer of East Asian construction）, as well as the traitor of East Asian peace. However, the reason why the Chongqing regime can苟延殘喘（linger on） and肆其凶頑（run amok） until today is because there is a potential British and American force behind it. Therefore, if we want to achieve peace and complete unification as soon as possible, we can only participate in the Greater East Asia War, thoroughly击破英美爲禍東亞之勢力（defeat the forces of Britain and the United States that endanger East Asia）, and even the Chongqing regime will趨於潰滅（collapse on its own）. This is another stage that we must go through to complete the great cause of peaceful unification.</p>
<p>Since the friendly country launched the Greater East Asia War, it has been invincible. In just one year, it has achieved unprecedentedly great victories everywhere. All the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in the South Pacific and Burma have been剷除凈盡（completely eradicated）. It is允以迭决所羅門海戰（appropriate to use the Solomons Sea battle fought multiple times） to make Britain and the United States suffer重創（heavy damage） and have no反攻能力（counterattack ability）. On the one hand, the German and Italian Axis击破英美聯軍（defeated the British and American Allied forces） in Europe, causing the British and American launched North African offensive to陷於不振頽勢（fall into a slump and decline），已成反攻無術（they are no longer able to mount a counteroffensive）. Now that our country has risen up to participate in the war, the united front has become more strengthened. As the saying goes, "An army with righteousness will be strong." Looking back on our Chinese nation's participation in foreign wars, this is the most meaningful war. Indeed, as the sages said, "An army of benevolence and righteousness will surely win." To destroy the British and American forces is直指顧間事耳（only a matter of turning one's head）.</p>
<p>At this critical moment for our country and nation, it is the time for our soldiers to work hard and rise up to sacrifice their lives to serve the country. At this moment, we should矢勤矢勇（pledge diligence and courage），竭智盡忠（exhaust our wisdom and be loyal），本同仇敵愾之心（based on the heart of sharing hatred with the enemy），勵殺敵致果之志（encourage the will to kill the enemy and achieve results），期與友軍由同甘共苦之精神進而爲同生共死之搏鬥（hope to advance from the spirit of sharing weal and woe with the friendly army to a struggle of living and dying together）. All our army, navy, and air force, at all levels, bear the heavy responsibility of direct command. They should勇猛邁進（advance bravely），加緊訓練（intensify training），務使我所屬國軍（ensure that our national army）, 將成精兵勁旅（will become elite troops）, 負起常前神聖偉大之使命（bear the sacred and great mission ahead）, 爲目前驅（drive for the present），百折不回（never give up），以圖迅掃英美敵氛（in order to quickly掃英美敵氛（sweep away） the British and American enemy atmosphere）, 還我自由（return our freedom）, 進以謀東亞共榮之實現（in order to realize the共榮（co-prosperity） of East Asia）, 世界和平之完成（world peace）.盛衰興替（prosperity and decline）,繫此一戰（depends on this one battle）,共喩是旨（we are all aware of this point）,有厚望焉（we have high hopes for it）委员长汪兆铭印（Chairman Wang Zhaoming, printed）</p>
<h3 id="e4">Commander of the Newly Compiled Fourth Division of Chongqing Wu Huawen Participates in the Peace Movement Leads His More Than 40,000 Troops to Surrender Issues a Declaration Supporting Chairman Wang <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th, Central News Agency - When the Lugouqiao Incident broke out in the 26th year of the Republic of China, in order to maintain China's independence, freedom, and sovereignty, we resolutely rose up. At that time, due to the influence of狹隘之愛國心（narrow-minded patriotism） and狹隘之朝野（narrow-minded government and opposition） on our national consciousness, we were willing to serve on the battlefield and mistakenly thought that抗戰即救國之道（resisting Japan was the way to save the country）. For six years, in order to hope to achieve final victory, we did not hesitate to sacrifice the lives of millions of people and devote most of the country's strength to resisting Japan. However, things went against our wishes. Not only did the purpose of resisting Japan have no effect, but it only陷民衆於塗炭（plunged the people into misery） more and more deeply. If this kind of situation is allowed to continue, regardless of the lives of the people, the country's vitality will be化爲灰燼（turned to ashes）. Therefore, Chairman Wang deeply believed that in this kind of crisis, the way to save the country was only peace. For the sake of China's future and for saving 400 million compatriots, he毅然脫出重慶（resolutely broke away from Chongqing） and responded to the Konoe statement. On December 29 of the 27th year of the Republic of China, he发表艳电（issued the flamboyant telegram）,首唱和平（first advocated peace）. For a time, the country's concerned and discerning people rose up to follow Chairman Zhu and engage in this great cause. The people received甘霖（timely rain） and景從領袖（followed the leader）,遂和運氣運澎湃興起（and the peace movement澎湃興起（surged up））,瞬即遍及全國各地（and instantly spread throughout the country）. Then the National Government returned to Nanjing and established the central government. At that time, although we did not yet understand Japan's true intentions, we had力戒輕舉妄動（strove to avoid rash actions） and努力於眞相之洞（worked hard to see the truth） for more than three years. I thought that the responsibility of the military was to defend the country and save the people. In this抗戰陣中（resistance front） that was日下（declining）, I deeply察我等之使命有違原來之意旨（observed that our mission violated its original intention）. Therefore, I had doubts about my mission and future. The Chongqing side now藉英美蘇之援助（relies on the assistance of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union） and dreams of achieving victory. Britain and the United States also企圖驅使渝方供其犧牲（attempted to drive the Chongqing side to sacrifice itself） with援渝爲藉口（the excuse of assisting Chongqing）. The Soviet Union also以中國爲赤化之對象（regards China as an object of 赤化（communization））,利用中國共黨作侵襲之先鋒（using the Chinese Communist Party as the vanguard of aggression）. Therefore, I deeply察渝方所稱之抗戰救國（observed that the so-called war of resistance to save the country by the Chongqing side）徒苦民衆而已（only苦民衆（makes the people suffer））. I am確信救國救民之大道唯有和平（certain that the great way to save the country and the people is only peace）. When the Greater East Asia War broke out in the 30th year of the Republic of China, Japan瞬卽將美侵略東亞之據（instantly took over all the bases of American aggression in East Asia）,使在芙美荷各國壓迫下之東亞民族獲得解放（allowing the East Asian nations oppressed by various countries to gain liberation）. This kind of劃期的偉業（epoch-making great cause）遂使我等豁然有悟（made me suddenly realize）,深信日本此舉確基於世界之正義（and deeply believe that this move by Japan is indeed based on world justice）. For the peace movement advocated by the chairman, I had全已獲得理解（completely understood） and I am確信與日本之提携合作（certain that cooperation with Japan）乃屬今日之急務（is today's urgent matter）. Therefore, we are一致團結（united as one），偕同過去六年來共命沙塲之戰友健兒四萬人（with 40,000 heroic soldiers who have been共命沙塲（fighting side by side） with me for the past six years），斷然脫離渝方（resolutely broke away from the Chongqing side）效忠和運（pledged loyalty to the peace movement），欣然參加大東亞戰爭（and happily participated in the Greater East Asia War）.尤以國府宣布參戰前（especially before the National Government announced its participation in the war）, 我等加入和平陣營（our joining the peace camp）, 引爲莫大光榮（is a great honor）.此後願奮勇於大東亞建設之偉業爲救國救民計（from now on, I am willing to奮勇於大東亞建設之偉業（bravely engage in the great cause of Greater East Asia construction）爲救國救民計（for the sake of saving the country and the people）），並殲滅山東地區之共匪（and annihilate the communists in the Shandong region）, 以向貫澈與復中華保衛東亞之大道邁進也（in order to move towards the great way of貫澈（persevering with） and復中華保衛東亞（reviving China and defending East Asia））。民國卅二年一月十八日（January 18th, 32nd year of the Republic of China），山東方面軍總司令陸軍上將吳化文（Wu Huawen, Commander-in-Chief of the Shandong Front Army, Army General），山東方面軍副司令陸軍中將寧春霖（Ning Chunlin, Deputy Commander of the Shandong Front Army, Army Lieutenant General），山東方面軍第一軍軍長陸軍中將于懷安（Yu Huaian, Commander of the First Army of the Shandong Front Army, Army Lieutenant General），山東方面軍總參謀長陸軍中將郭爲天（Guo Weitian, Chief of Staff of the Shandong Front Army, Army Lieutenant General）。</p>

<h3 id="e5">German Troops on Eastern Front Adopt Resilient Defensive Tactics German Side Admits Loss of Luki City Fierce Battle for S City Intensifies <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 18th, Havas News Agency - According to sources here, fierce fighting is taking place in the Stalin City area on the Eastern Front. Each of the Red Army's attacks was repelled after the gaps in the German defenses were filled.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th, Reuters - There is still no change in the situation on the Eastern Front. After the German troops withdrew from Velikiye Luki, the area is still in the hands of the Soviet army. The German troops who were surrounded in the area were not annihilated.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th, Reuters - The defensive strategy adopted by the German troops in this winter's Eastern Front war has the characteristics of elasticity. The tasks performed by the commando teams are maximized. In addition to surprise attacks, they also launch counterattacks many times to recover the lost positions. They have made great contributions. For example, recently two major supply bases of the enemy southeast of Lake Ilmen were cut off, and the Soviet positions were surrounded, all due to the credit of the German commando teams. The Soviet tank units attacked our positions south of Lake Ladoga and were repelled by the defending troops, and many tanks were destroyed. German aircraft are actively assisting the army in combat.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 18th, Allied News Agency - In the past week, there has been fierce fighting in the S City area. German troops resisted the Soviet attacks and held their positions. They repelled the Soviet troops in several battles and launched counterattacks. The German troops issued a war report on the 17th, admitting the fact of fierce fighting, saying that the Soviet troops had launched fierce attacks again and had been repelled by the German troops. This is enough to show that the German troops are still ensuring the entire line of defense. In addition, the German authorities admitted that the German troops in the area had lost contact with other fronts, so the dispatch of reinforcements and supplies was impossible without relying on aircraft. The fighting seemed to be quite difficult. In addition, the fighting in the city of S has become more intense, especially in the northern industrial area, where deadly battles have been fought repeatedly in recent days. The air superiority in the S City area is still in the hands of the German troops. In fact, the Soviet troops only surrounded the outer perimeter of the area. Although the Soviet side is trying to exaggerate propaganda, the main positions of the German side, which has a large army in the area, are still not shaken in any way.</p>
<p>Italian General Danazi Killed in Action</p>

<p>Vichy, 17th (Havas News Agency) – According to observers here, the fierce battles on the Eastern Front, China's entry into the war, and the friction between Britain and the United States in North Africa were all major events of the past week. Regarding the Eastern Front, the battles in the Caucasus and the southern route were particularly intense. The Soviet army, unwilling to suffer heavy casualties, constantly attacked the Axis lines, while the German army adopted a "resilient defensive tactic" in the Don River basin. At the end of last week, the Soviet army launched a new offensive in the Voronezh region, but this move was expected by the German High Command, as German reconnaissance planes had learned in advance that the Soviet army had concentrated a large force. As for Velikiye Luki, the German defenders were once besieged by the Soviet army, and the supplies they needed were only provided by German aircraft from the air. However, during the past week, this isolated force has broken through the Soviet encirclement and made contact with reinforcements. The battles in the Ilmen Lake and Lake Ladoga areas are also very active. The Soviet army has recently taken advantage of the freezing of Lake Ladoga to lay temporary railways, so it has become the target of attacks by German and Finnish forces. There have been no major changes on the North African front recently. The British and American Allied forces once advanced to Djeida, only ten miles from Tunis, but have now retreated to about thirty miles from Pont du Fahs and forty miles from the port of Tunis. The Free French forces on the southern route advanced north from Lake Chad and have come into contact with the Italian army in southern Libya. The French forces in the Cairo area have also been ordered to advance north and deploy defenses near Bu Arada. In addition, Italian light cruisers raided the port of Algiers, sinking an Allied cruiser and two cargo ships. There have also been no major changes on the eastern front in Libya. The British Eighth Army under Montgomery has arrived near Buerat and deployed defenses. As for the Atlantic Ocean, the war is still continuing. Axis submarines continue to attack British and American ships. According to Berlin, from the 1st to the 12th of this month, Britain and the United States lost a total of 257,000 tons of merchant ships. Regarding political matters, such as China's entry into the war and the signing of a new treaty between China and Japan, the Axis powers have unanimously praised them. Italy has also announced the abandonment of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions. In Britain and the United States, treaties have been signed with Chongqing, declaring the abandonment of the same rights. Regarding the situation in North Africa, Giraud and Darlan have not been able to reach an agreement, and the situation seems to be deteriorating. British and American public opinion is extremely alarmed by the slow progress of the Allied forces in North Africa. American newspapers are using this to mock the British army, while British newspapers are blaming the American General Eisenhower. In addition, Britain has also hinted that if the various Free French generals cannot compromise with each other, Britain and the United States may be "forced to implement supervisory politics" in North Africa. Regarding the situation in Southeastern Europe, the visits of Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu and Bulgarian Army Chief of Staff Sonov to meet with Führer Hitler are also attracting much attention.</p>
<p>Near East: Turkey is currently conducting a parliamentary election, scheduled to be held on the 22nd of next month, and the general public in that country is deeply concerned about the developments in the Mediterranean, fearing that it will affect Turkey's neutrality. The recent landing of American troops on the island of Cyprus is seen by the Turkish people as a sign of imminent danger.</p>
<p>Americas: US President Roosevelt's submission of a budget to Congress, announcing the implementation of tax increases and restricting people's consumption, and the opposition of isolationist Senator La Follette to the shipment of American food to Britain, are also attracting worldwide attention. In addition, the economic situation of various South American countries has already been deteriorating, but recently, the United States, due to a lack of ships, has decided to suspend the export of American goods to South America in the next two months. It is expected that South America's economic difficulties are just beginning. In the political arena, although Chile and Argentina are under pressure from the United States, they have reaffirmed their determination to maintain neutrality.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, 18th (Haitong News Agency) – Chilean dispatches reveal that Chile may break off relations with the Axis powers soon. Although Argentine political figures are surprised by the sudden change in Chile's attitude, they believe that Argentina will not be affected by it in any way. People here speculate that Chile's desire to solve its economic difficulties and rely on US assistance is the motivation for Chilean Interior Minister Beltrán's reciprocal visit to Washington. The US government must have made some promises, and Chile had no choice but to change its attitude towards the Axis powers. Rumors are circulating that the US and Chile have considered adopting a convoy system to protect ships traveling between the two countries.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 18th (Associated Press) – The Chilean Senate is scheduled to hold a closed-door meeting on the 19th. Foreign Minister Fernández met with the Argentine Ambassador on the 15th and held a long private conversation. The nature of the conversation may be an exchange of views on the diplomatic policies of the two countries. According to reliable sources, the Argentine Ambassador expressed to Foreign Minister Fernández that Argentina's current diplomatic policy has not changed. The Argentine Ambassador also met with President Ríos and presented a personal letter from the Argentine President.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 18th (Haitong News Agency) – Argentine Foreign Minister Dr. Guani, when interviewed by reporters here, stated that the purpose of this reciprocal visit to the United States is to solve the country's economic difficulties. Uruguay lacks gasoline, industrial production is being hit, and unemployment has increased by 100,000. He hopes to borrow money from the United States to continue the aircraft and Negro River dam projects and intends to contact the Soviet Ambassador to the United States about the resumption of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Uruguay.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 18th (Associated Press) – The Information Bureau announced this afternoon that Prime Minister Tojo's authority in this area will be expanded to increase wartime production and unify administrative policies. This was decided by the cabinet at a meeting held on New Year's Eve. A decree on this matter was immediately drafted, its basic principles were approved by the Privy Council on Wednesday, and it was formally passed by the cabinet on Friday. The decree was approved by the Emperor and will be promulgated immediately. It stipulates that when necessary to increase the production of important items such as copper, iron, coal, light metals, ships, and aircraft, the Prime Minister has the authority to command relevant cabinet ministers and can directly or through the ministers exercise his authority over labor, materials, and required funds to facilitate and unify his supervisory powers.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Establishment of the Japanese Institute of Ethnology Announced <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government, recognizing the lack of a comprehensive research institution for the various ethnic groups within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, has allocated a recurring expense of 110,000 yen and a temporary expense of 250,000 yen in the 17th fiscal year budget for research expenses. In March of last year, a preparatory committee for the Institute of Ethnology was established in the Ministry of Education to carry out various preparatory works. Recently, with preparations completed, the official system of the Institute of Ethnology was announced on the 18th and implemented immediately. The Institute of Ethnology has thus been established. The mission of the institute is to conduct fundamental and practical investigations of the various ethnic groups related to the construction of Greater East Asia and to conduct research on them. The first director has been decided to be tentatively held concurrently by Professor Takata Yasuma, Doctor of Literature, of Kyoto Imperial University. As for the number of participants, they will be selected from relevant agencies and knowledgeable and experienced personnel.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a telephone call from Kyoto, Dr. Takata Yasuma, the first director of the Japanese Institute of Ethnology, issued the following statement: Due to the rapid advancement of our country's national power, we have come into contact with ethnic groups with a wide range and a large number of people. These ethnic groups in Greater East Asia have been exploited in the past, so Japan must implement a national policy with basic knowledge and correct understanding. Because Japan's progress is too rapid and because of its island nation status, its knowledge and understanding of the outside world are somewhat insufficient. Correcting this is an urgent task at hand. With the assistance of Professor Niimura Izuru of Tokyo Imperial University, the chairman of the National Association, we are determined to work for a newly emerging and correct national policy.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Recent European Political Situation: The Anglo-American Sabotage Plan Fails; The Unity of the Axis Powers is Strengthened; Translated from the January 7th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Lisbon, 4th, Special Correspondent Sakuragi of the Mainichi Shimbun) Following the Spanish-Portuguese talks at the end of last year, the German-Italian-French talks at the beginning of this year, Germany quickly announced the replacement of its ambassadors to Spain and Sweden, and the dynamics of the European political situation have taken on a new turn. The outlook for the European political situation at the beginning of the New Year is quite favorable for the Axis powers. The change of the German ambassador to Spain, along with the development of the new situation in North Africa, is particularly noteworthy as it will launch a new concept of diplomatic policy toward the Iberian Peninsula, which is increasingly important.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the main driving force of European politics lies in Germany, and the trend of international politics has its realistic background. Although the United States and Britain have gained a military advantage by invading French Africa, Germany has come up with a strategy to divide the anti-Axis war plan in Africa on the one hand, and to hold back the US and British forces in Africa. On the other hand, Germany is fully consolidating Europe during this period, bringing the enemy's operations to a complete standstill. So, what kind of developments have taken place in Europe's political movements since the end of last year? The Balkans and Northern Europe (including so-called neutral Sweden) can be said to have been largely consolidated.</p>
<p>Among these countries, Romania has had its policy turned 180 degrees by Prime Minister Antonescu. Among the countries defeated by Germany, Norway, under the leadership of Prime Minister Quisling, was the first to embark on the path of reconstruction. Therefore, from a political point of view, these two countries have become very Nazified. Although the domestic policies of Finland and Hungary are not necessarily Nazified, their cooperation with Germany has not changed in the slightest. In the speeches of Hungarian Prime Minister Kallay and Finnish President Ryti, and in Germany's response to them, there is a sincere understanding of each other. The old trick of the United States and Britain to use the opposition between Nazism and the cultural characteristics of each country as a tool to carry out their conspiracies on domestic policy has clearly become obsolete.</p>
<p>The German-Italian-French talks, which were held after Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and French Prime Minister Laval were invited to Germany, were divided into two groups: the German-Italian military talks and the German-Italian political talks with France. The United States and Britain underestimated Italy's firm determination to wage war. Since the start of the invasion of French North Africa, they have repeatedly used various tactics to target anti-fascist elements, and spread their divisive magic hand to alienate the Axis powers. However, as a result of the German-Italian talks, the two countries' understanding of military integration in terms of offense and defense has been further strengthened. Now, German and Italian troops are fighting side by side, regardless of each other. German troops and military supplies are successively entering Italy, so the room for political maneuvers by the United States and Britain against Italy has completely disappeared. As for the content of the talks with French Prime Minister Laval, it should be as follows:</p>
<p>Decision on the conditions for a German-Italian-French peace;</p>
<p>France's cooperation with the Axis powers;</p>
<p>France's new military organization and its military agreements with the Axis powers;</p>
<p>Strengthening the Pétain-Laval government.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the conditions for peace, the possibility of a peace treaty being concluded has suddenly increased. Also, regarding the issue in Item , the person in charge of coordination will naturally be Prime Minister Laval. Therefore, in the future, he will be able to get Prime Minister Laval and Déat and Doriot to shake hands, eliminate the opposition between Paris and Vichy, and enable all of mainland France to join hands with the Axis powers. Although there is currently the issue of the formation of a single French political party, and the issue of the organization and utilization of the new army, the former is advocated by the Paris faction and can be easily resolved by their understanding with Prime Minister Laval, with Laval serving as the party leader. As for the latter, it is not like the volunteer system of the Tricolor Brigade that is currently appearing on the Soviet front, but a conscription system. With the cooperation of the German army, it will be responsible for the security of the occupied territories in the Balkans and Ukraine, so that the remaining German troops can go to the front line. This method can be considered the most practical, and Germany will provide it with full assistance. The exposure of the Darlan faction can be said to be beneficial to the Axis powers and to Europe. The United States and Britain's plot to use France as a base for attacks on Germany in Europe has thus failed.</p>
<p>Finally, let us talk about the Iberian Peninsula. Both Spain and Portugal on the peninsula are neutral in the current war. It is wrong to think that the relationship between Spain and the Axis powers and the relationship between Portugal and the United States and Britain are balanced. Spain can be said to be a member cooperating with the Axis powers, but Portugal is not a member of the US-British camp either. Therefore, the work of the United States and Britain on Iberia is intensifying. For Spain, it is necessary to prevent Portugal from becoming a victim of the United States and Britain. This meeting is said to have been held at the request of Spanish President General Franco, but the relationship between the two countries has greatly improved since the time of Foreign Minister Suner. Portugal, with maintaining neutrality as the center of its national policy, will not object to maintaining its neutrality through the Iberian Group (tentative translation).</p>

<p>Argentine Capital, 18th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the Pennsylvania coal miners' strike, which had shown a glimmer of hope for resolution due to the wartime labor board's compulsory resumption of work order, has deteriorated again because the wartime labor board rejected the resumption conditions of 15,000 miners from the Hazleton coal mine. It is reported that the number of striking workers in the Wilkes-Barre area has also increased by 6,100, and the strike situation is showing a trend of expansion.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Haitong News Agency telegram) - News received here last night from Washington states that 20,000 miners in Pennsylvania have declared a strike, and an average of 88 miners are joining the strike daily. As a result, coal mining in the area has been affected. The reason for the strike is the miners' opposition to the increase in union dues.

All mediation efforts have been ineffective.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Authorities Requisition All Gunny Sacks in the City, Food from the Interior Will Be Shipped to Shanghai, Japanese Embassy Office Issues Announcement, Hoping for Cooperation from People of All Nations in Shanghai, Forced Execution Will Be Implemented if the Number Is Insufficient to Expedite Food Transportation <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>In order to maintain the food supply for Shanghai residents, after implementing new measures for controlling food, the authorities have strictly prohibited hoarding, stockpiling, and black market transactions. According to general observations, rice prices in the four suburban areas of Shanghai, such as Pudong, Songjiang, Qingpu, Jiaxing, Suzhou, and Pinghu, will continue to fall in the coming days. It is reported that the authorities have already engaged in large-scale purchases from rice-producing areas to distribute to Shanghai residents. At the same time, agreements have been reached with various flour manufacturers, and the authorities will purchase the flour produced by each factory at a fixed price to distribute to the citizens to supplement the rice shortage. According to investigations conducted by a reporter from the "Times," local Chinese residents, since the household registration for rice and flour and the sugar ration for January were increased in the past three weeks, are now hoping that after the Lunar New Year holiday, the authorities can further increase the per capita ration of these daily necessities.</p>
<p>Purchase of Gunny Sacks</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, this city news, according to news last night, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, and the Municipal Government will, starting today (Tuesday), requisition all gunny sacks stored in this city and purchase them at approximately 12% below market price, aiming to collect a sufficient number of gunny sacks to transport agricultural products from the interior to Shanghai. It is reported that if the authorities fail to collect the expected number of gunny sacks, they will implement compulsory requisition. The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy has issued an announcement explaining the matter, emphasizing the necessity of this measure to cope with the current shortage of gunny sacks, so that gunny sacks can be used to pack important products such as rice and wheat and various raw materials for the oil industry in this area to Shanghai, and the approach of the Lunar New Year is also a motivation for this measure. The Embassy Office has formally designated the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, and the Municipal Government to begin purchasing all gunny sacks, and hopes that people of all nations in Shanghai will understand the intentions of the authorities and cooperate by voluntarily selling the gunny sacks they possess.</p>
<p>Quantity of Rations</p>
<p>The household rice for the 24th period has been fully extracted from the Taikoo and other godowns by the rice shops in the two concessions and will begin to be sold on the 21st. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the quantity of household rice for the 25th period is expected to be moderately increased. It is hoped that the rice rations will be white rice for each period, without the addition of broken rice. At the same time, the quantity of flour will also be moderately increased. Currently, citizens feel that the per capita ration system is good, but they hope that the quantity of food allocated each time will be considered.</p>
<p>Flour Industry Demands</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council issued a formal notice at the end of last year, ordering various flour-based food stores to implement the method of exchanging flour for flour products, various flour product industry groups in this city have found that the implementation of this new method is quite difficult, and its impact has caused the business of each store to be hit. Therefore, these groups have submitted requests for alternative methods. In addition to the wine and food industry's cooked noodle group obtaining permission from the authorities to restore the distribution of flour, the requests from other flour product industries are still under consideration. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Cake, Steamed Bread, and Fried Dough Stick Industry United Benefit Association and the Machine-Made Cut Noodle Industry Guild have submitted applications to the authorities again today. The reporter from Datong News Agency records the various situations as follows:</p>
<p>Cut Noodle Industry Makes Two Demands</p>
<p>Since submitting a written request for a change in the flour distribution method for the first time a few days ago, the machine-made cut noodle industry in this city has now formulated two points of opinion, requesting the authorities to approve them: ① Request that household cut noodle certificates be issued to residents, and each cut noodle store will issue cut noodles based on the certificates, which can avoid the abuse of each cut noodle store selling the obtained flour at inflated prices on the black market. ② The flour recently distributed by the authorities is currently stored in each store, because residents do not have the ability to request an exchange of cut noodles for flour, so the stored flour has become frozen. Moreover, many residents have asked cut noodle stores to purchase cut noodles with cash, but due to the authorities' orders, they ultimately refuse. Therefore, it is requested that the authorities lift the restriction on retail sales.</p>
<p>Dispatch Representatives to State Grievances</p>
<p>The Cake, Steamed Bread, and Fried Dough Stick Industry United Benefit Association will dispatch representatives to submit a written request to the Shanghai Municipal Council today, stating that after the flour distribution is stopped, the members of the industry will inevitably have difficulty in operating their businesses and will feel difficulties in their lives. Moreover, the general poor laborers, once retail sales are restricted, will become starving people and turn to wrongdoing. Therefore, they specifically request the authorities to understand the difficulties of the industry and its customers and grant the restoration of the original state.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Shanghai Municipal Council General Manager Ozawa Issues Inaugural Speech, Has Long Studied the Concession Issue, Hopes the Public Will Assist in Implementing Policies <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The newly appointed General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Ozawa, issued his inaugural speech as follows: At this important time of the Greater East Asia War, I am deeply aware of the responsibilities entrusted to me as the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, which are profound and great.</p>
<p>Formerly Chief Consul in Xiamen</p>
<p>My previous post was Xiamen, where there is also a public concession like Shanghai. The structure and operation methods of the Xiamen Shanghai Municipal Council are quite similar to those of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The only difference is that the Xiamen Shanghai Municipal Council is smaller. When I was in Xiamen, I served as the Chief Consul of the Consular Corps and the Japanese Consul General. Due to my direct guidance and supervision responsibilities, I have done considerable research on the concession issue. If this research can be of some use as a reference for handling the affairs of the Shanghai Public Concession, I would be fortunate.</p>
<p>Expresses Deep Sympathy for Residents' Difficulties</p>
<p>Now that the Holy War has reached its third year, the concession must study various appropriate strategies to cope with the long-term war situation in order to deal with the East Asian political situation. Regarding these issues, I intend to maintain full coordination with the relevant authorities and implement various measures. The biggest problem now, especially regarding food and other things, is that it is quite difficult for the residents of the concession, most of whom are Chinese people, and I am fully aware of this and express my deep sympathy. The authorities must do their best to improve public welfare, but this situation is common in all countries around the world during wartime, and it is not only the Chinese people who are suffering. Regarding this, I hope the public can understand and the Chinese people can also rely on and assist the authorities' policies with the great spirit of sharing joys and sorrows.</p>

<h3 id="e42">In Memory of Mr. Gu Dingfu: Establishing a Scholarship for Impoverished Students; His Son's Outstanding Reputation in the Financial World; His Filial Piety is a Model for Society; The Need for Aid is Urgent as the School Year Approaches <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Application and registration for the fourth annual Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship for Impoverished Students has only been open for four days, and the crowds are more numerous than in previous years. Yesterday, we received a letter from the Gu Xin Yi Cheng Zhai brothers, who generously established a scholarship for impoverished students. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Dingfu Scholarship for Impoverished Students</p>
<p>The virtuous Gu Xin Yi Cheng Zhai brothers wrote to this newspaper yesterday, saying, "We are writing to commemorate our late father, Mr. Gu Dingfu, by establishing a scholarship for impoverished middle school students. We have tentatively set the number of scholarships at five. All school-mandated tuition and fees will be borne by us until the completion of middle school. We would like to entrust your esteemed publication with the selection of students. Detailed rules will be provided separately. Sincerely, Gu Xin Yi Cheng Zhai, January 18, 32nd year [of the Republic]."</p>
<p>Scholarship Regulations</p>
<p>Regulations for the Gu Dingfu Scholarship for Impoverished Students: (1) The Scholarship for Impoverished Students is intended as long-term financial aid; (2) The number of Scholarships for Impoverished Students is tentatively set at five, to be selected by the Shen Bao through examination of impoverished middle school students; (3) The scholarship includes school tuition and fees. At the beginning of each semester, the fee payment slip should be presented to the Shen Bao for payment until graduation from middle school; (4) If the academic performance in each semester is above 80 points, and the school certifies that the student's conduct is proper, the scholarship will be granted as stipulated after verification by the Shen Bao. Otherwise, the scholarship will be terminated, and the Shen Bao will select a replacement student; (5) In the event of withdrawal from school, the newspaper must be notified of the reason, and the Shen Bao will be entrusted to replenish the scholarship quota.</p>
<p>Generous Scholarship: Perpetuating His Legacy</p>
<p>Upon receiving the letter from the Gu family, this newspaper deeply admired the sincerity of the two brothers' filial piety. After visiting this model family, we learned that Mr. Gu Dingfu was formerly engaged in the silk industry. He was diligent and frugal, and enjoyed doing good deeds. He made outstanding contributions to the industrial sector. In recent years, witnessing the increasing hardships of the general public, he often generously provided assistance. Last autumn, he suddenly succumbed to stomach disease. All sectors were deeply shocked and mourned his passing. His son, Mr. Xin Yi, is currently the assistant manager of the Sifu Bank. Mr. Cheng Zhai originally worked for the Siming Bank and has recently been hired by Dawei Bank as a manager. Both have outstanding reputations in the financial world. The two brothers are models of filial piety. To permanently commemorate their respected father, they have established the "Gu Dingfu Scholarship for Impoverished Students" and entrusted this newspaper with the selection process. The two brothers' benevolent and righteous act of generously providing scholarships to cultivate talent as a permanent memorial is a profound gift to society, which is also a testament to Mr. Dingfu's virtuous upbringing of his sons, truly worthy of perpetuation for generations to come. As for the selection procedures, the staff of this newspaper will, in the spirit of the Gu family's enthusiastic support for education, treat it with utmost seriousness. It is hoped that the five students who receive assistance will cultivate their character and study diligently to become pillars of society, thereby repaying the benefits of the scholarship and comforting Mr. Dingfu in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Notification Slips for Aid: Hoping for a Steady Stream of Donations</p>
<p>The number of applications for registration this year has surged, and the existing scholarships are extremely limited. School fees have continued to increase, and the opening of schools is imminent. The anticipation of impoverished students for assistance is more urgent than ever before. We sincerely hope that all sectors will be aware of this situation and promptly provide donations so that students can have the opportunity to study with peace of mind. To facilitate donations, we published a donation notification slip in the scholarship special edition of this newspaper on the 17th. We hope that all sectors will fill in the amount of donation and mail it to this newspaper, and we will immediately send someone with an official receipt to collect it.</p>
<p>Application Deadline for the Elementary School Group</p>
<p>Although we have received the majority of applications for scholarships from the elementary school group, the payment and school opening dates for various elementary schools are getting closer. We hereby set the deadline for issuing application registration forms for elementary schools at 5:00 PM this (19th) afternoon. All elementary school students who have already obtained registration forms must submit them by 5:00 PM on the 22nd. Within this limited time, we must still go through the various procedures of screening, investigation, and review. We hope that all applicants will pay attention to the various notifications in this newspaper to avoid any omissions.</p>
<p>Donations Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The scholarships received yesterday totaled 1,000 yuan from the colleagues of the Shanghai Money Trade Joint Preparatory Office as congratulatory gifts for Mr. Wu Qinfu's 50th birthday, 1,000 yuan from Mr. Ma Jiwen, 200 yuan from Zhao Jinbo, 35 yuan from Shao Nianchang, 30 yuan from Han Tao, 20 yuan from Jiang Liuqing, 10 yuan each from Xu Nanhai, Chuan Yichuan, Fei Shanzeng, Kong Xinyi, Pei Shi, and the Reverend Hongdao, 5.5 yuan from Sun Anonymous, 5 yuan from Fang Guo, 73 yuan from Pan Wenyue (female). The previous balance was 118,939 yuan, leaving a balance of 121,297.5 yuan. (According to a letter from Xu Nanhai and Chuan Yichuan, they were originally impoverished children who graduated from charity schools through the introduction of charitable individuals. Now they are working in the business world, and out of gratitude, they donated one month's income to the scholarship fund. In addition, Liu Youzhen, a high school classmate from Huiwen Middle School, collected 1,360 yuan from relatives and friends overnight and sent it to donate to the scholarship fund, which is deeply moving. Their enthusiasm is commendable.)</p>

<h3 id="e45">The Sugar Merchant Cooperative Announced The Method of Distributing Sugar Based on Population; The Area and Date Will be Announced After Consultation; Designated Sugar Firms Will Govern Each Retailer <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office, in order to maintain the normal sugar needs of food households and curb profiteering through resale, has, with the approval of the military distribution authorities, implemented sugar rationing based on population. All the simple regulations and detailed rules have been formulated by the cooperative and promulgated in advance. The implementation area and date will be announced after consultation with the relevant authorities so that the public will be informed. The reporter of this newspaper learned from the cooperative yesterday about the simple regulations and detailed rules for sugar distribution based on population, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Simple Regulations for Sugar Rationing Based on Population</p>
<p>Simple Regulations for Sugar Rationing Based on Population, Chapter 1 General Rules, Article 1, In order to protect the legitimate sugar needs of citizens for consumption, the office will ration sugar based on the Baobai system. Article 2, The scope of the rationing is limited to the Baobai areas of the Common Concession, French Concession, Hongkou, Huxi, Nanshi, and Zhabei. Article 3, The population of the area receiving the rationing will be based on the Jia unit. The Jia head will fill in the number of people in each household under his jurisdiction on the front and back of the "Household Sugar Rationing Application Form" (three copies in total), with each household head stamping their seal in the seal column, and indicating the amount of house tax paid each period (if there is no house tax, indicate "none" and have the Bao head stamp and prove it), and then the Jia head will send it to the office as a basis for rationing. Article 4, If there is a change in the population, the Jia head in charge shall notify the office in writing of the number of people entering and leaving before the 15th of each month for verification and distribution. The procedure for changing the household head's seal shall also be handled in the same way.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 Rationing, Article 5, The office will distribute sugar based on population once a month. The amount of sugar each person receives and the price of the rationed sugar will be announced in the newspaper by the office on the first day of each month. Article 6, After the office verifies the rationed amount according to the population, it will issue a "Sugar Buying Voucher," one for each person, and hand it over to the Jia head to distribute to each household under his jurisdiction. The head of household should distribute this voucher to each sub-household, without delay. Violators will be subject to punishment by the authorities. Article 7, The rationed sugar includes green sugar, red sugar, and white sugar. No objection should be made if the purchase is bundled. The weight shall be based on the 16-tael balance.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Purchase, Article 8, After receiving the sugar buying voucher, the household can buy or not buy as they please. If they need to buy, they should fill in the Bao and Jia to which they belong on the back of the sugar buying voucher (ie, which street, which Lianbao, which Bao, which Jia, which household), and the head of the household should stamp the original seal (ie, the seal stamped on the front and back of the household sugar rationing application form), and then prepare a container for sugar, and take it to the designated retailer (the number is printed on the front of the sugar buying voucher) for purchase. The retailer will only allow the purchase after verifying that the seal matches. Article 9, When a sub-household buys sugar, in addition to filling in the Bao and Jia to which they belong on the back of the sugar buying voucher, the head of the household should stamp the original seal. The head of the household should not refuse. If there is any obstruction or refusal, it may be reported to the office. Article 10, The retailers designated to sell household sugar have been numbered by the office, and each number is marked on the door for identification. The office will print and send the number and address to each Jia head for safekeeping. Residents can inquire and buy sugar at the address each month. Article 11, The sugar buying voucher is issued once a month, and its validity period is limited to 4:00 PM on the last day of the month. It will be void if it expires. If it is lost, it will not be reissued. Article 12, If a retailer exceeds the price limit, deducts the quantity, or mixes adulterants, the purchaser may report to the office. If anyone forges a sugar buying voucher, the office will report to the authorities for strict punishment in accordance with the destruction of the system. Chapter 4 Supplementary Provisions, Article 13, If there are any unstated matters in these simple regulations, they may be supplemented at any time through public announcement. Article 14, These simple regulations shall be implemented after being reported to the authorities for approval.</p>
<p>Detailed Rules for Handling Household Sugar</p>
<p>Detailed Rules for Rationing Sugar to Households: (1) The office will formulate simple regulations for household sugar and ration sugar in accordance with the Baojia system. Due to the importance of the affairs, 58 sugar firms will be divided into several groups, and each group will be responsible for handling the matters entrusted by the office in a designated Baojia district, and be responsible for governing the retailers. (2) After the office finds out the number of households in each district, it will hand over three copies of the "Application for Household Sugar Rationing" (the front and back) to the sugar firm in that group to send to the Jia head. The Jia head will fill in the households in the Jia on the front and back, and each household head will affix their seal in the seal column, and indicate the amount of housing tax paid each period. If there is no housing tax, it will be marked "None," and the Bao head will stamp to prove that the households filled in are correct. After the proof, the Jia head will send the three copies to the office. The office will check the original in order, divide it into districts and compile it into a book, as the basis for distribution. One copy will be sent to the retailer for verification after the designation of the retailer is determined. Another copy will be handed over to the sugar firm for inspection purposes. (3) After the office has verified the number of households in each district, it will issue the "Sugar Buying Certificate" to the Lianbao unit, and hand it over to the sugar firm in that group to send to the Jia head, who will distribute it to each head of household for purchase. (4) The office will print the street, Lianbao, Bao, Jia, and household to which it belongs on the back of the sugar buying certificate, and the purchaser will fill it in himself. The head of the household shall stamp the original seal and take it to the designated retailer to buy it. (5) The office will pre-audit the distribution of household sugar, whether it is increased or decreased, every month. The share and sugar price per person will be announced in the newspaper on the first day of each month, and the retailer will sell it according to the price. (6) Announce to Retailer A: If you are willing to follow the regulations of the office and sell household sugar, please re-register. The office will assign a number to you as a designated retailer. Each retailer will mark the number on the door for identification. However, after the retailer is registered, it shall not be stopped or moved halfway unless it is cancelled by the office. (7) After the number of sugar in each Lianbao household is approved, it will be handed over to the sugar firm to distribute to each designated retailer for sale. If its scope is large, it can be increased to the number of several Lianbao, which will be approved by the office according to the situation. (8) After the sugar for each Lianbao household is designated to be purchased from the retailer, in addition to printing the number on the front of the sugar buying certificate, a copy of the application form will be sent to the retailer for safekeeping. When a purchaser brings a certificate to buy, the retailer should check the Baojia to which the purchaser belongs on the back, in order, and verify whether the seal stamped by the head of the household is consistent with the seal on the copy of the application form. If it is true, then he is allowed to buy. Otherwise, he will be refused, and he should mark "Only those with consistent seals are allowed to buy sugar" on the door. If anyone sells to those whose seals do not match, the office will punish the retailer according to the seriousness of the circumstances. (9) After the retailer verifies the seal and issues the sugar, he will paste the left corner of the sugar buying certificate on the old newspaper, ten sheets per row, and hand it over to the office for cancellation every ten days. The office will randomly check the seals on the certificate submitted by Mchu against the seal on the original application. (10) The retailer must sell the sugar at the price stipulated by the office, and must not deduct the quantity or mix adulterants. The sugar firm in each group will check it at any time.</p>
<p>The Sugar Delivery Procedure Will Be Changed</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai News of the Central News Agency, the implementation of population-based sugar distribution in the two concessions is used to universally resolve the threat of sugar. It is now known that obstacles have occurred in the implementation process. The system of assigning personnel to supervise sales will be changed. The citizens of the boundary still rely on housing donation tickets to purchase sugar. However, in the future, the sugar merchant cooperative business office will directly handle the chapter of adding the stamp on the housing donation ticket. First, the retail sugar merchants will collect the housing donation tickets and submit them to the cooperative office. After the office adds the stamp on the donation tickets, they will be issued to the citizens to carve sugar. On the same day, they will not be able to purchase. All the tricks and frauds between merchants will be completely eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="e53">The Crossing Fee on the Public Ferries of the Huangpu River is Uniformly Forty Cents Per Person <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Previously, the crossing fee for public ferries in the Huangpu River in this city was increased from three cents to four cents by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau in December of last year because the cost of living increased and the fare income was not enough to maintain the ferries. The bureau believed that the living conditions of the ferry operators were indeed difficult, but the livelihood of the citizens should also be taken into account, and the request was being carefully investigated. However, recently, the fee for rowing a boat was five cents per person, which led to all the ferries south of Dongchang Road following suit. Therefore, on the 18th of this month, representatives from various ferry operators and rowing industry associations were summoned to the bureau for detailed discussion. At that time, it was approved that the fare would be uniformly forty cents from the 19th of this month, except for the Xidu Ferry, which charges three cents because most of the passengers are workers and the situation is special. No one is allowed to ask for more under any pretext. Those who violate this will have their licenses revoked or be ordered to suspend business.</p>

<h3 id="e58">French Concession District Baojia Associations Adopt Guidance Committee System <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Each District Establishes Independent Offices, Deputy District Chief Candidates Announced</p>
<p>The Baojia system in the French Concession, its highest administrative system, has undergone slight changes starting this year. However, the grassroots organization remains unchanged. The details are outlined below:</p>
<p>The Baojia system in the French Concession uses the Lianbao (joint responsibility system) as its basic organization, with the Central Preparatory General Association and the District Committees as higher guidance institutions. Starting from January 1st this year, the above-mentioned organizations were abolished and replaced with a guidance committee system. In addition to the Baojia Guidance Committee, each of the six districts—Central, MacMahon, Joffre, Foch, Gignoux, and Xiaodongmen—will have a District Chief and a Deputy District Chief.</p>
<p>The candidates for the Baojia Guidance Committee and the District Chief have already been announced by the French Consulate. The candidates for Deputy District Chief have been elected by the Lianbao chiefs' conferences in each district and then submitted to the French Consulate for approval. Official appointments will be made by order of the Consulate. The list of Deputy District Chiefs will be announced soon. The Baojia Associations in each district have now been changed to the District Chief's Office to adapt to the new system.</p>
<p>Although the French Concession Police have abolished night patrols, the Lianbao in each district have designated individuals to be responsible for night duty. For example, in the Foch District, the district is divided into four sections, with the Lianbao assigning personnel in each section to be responsible for duty, watching and listening for alarms, and preparing for any sudden incidents.</p>

Zhonghua Book Company reached a high of 187.5 yuan, a gain of 15 yuan. Commercial Press also rose by 10 yuan. There were high-selling customers at World Book Company, and it also rose by 5 yuan. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile Factory fell slightly by 2.5 yuan again. Dasheng No. 1 Factory was around 410 yuan. Among small-denomination stocks, Great China Weaving rose to over 9 yuan, while Hongsheng fell back to 8.25 yuan. Meiya Silk Factory had transactions at 29 yuan.

<h3 id="e63">Government Bonds Sluggish and Listless <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The government bond market remained weak and unable to recover yesterday. It rose slightly at one point but eventually fell and remained listless, lower than on Saturday. Every year at the end of the year, small-denomination bonds are usually weak. This year, due to different circumstances and tight credit, government bonds are not comparable to real goods. It is feared that the trend this year will not be good. Because various bonds had been excited once before and then immediately fell, it can be seen that the strength is weak. Yesterday, type C bonds initially traded at a few jiao, once rising to over two yuan, but immediately fell upon selling, eventually closing at 1.45 yuan. Type A bonds were around one yuan. Type B and Type E bonds were both over 50 yuan. Type D bonds traded from 9 yuan to 50 yuan, eventually closing at just over 9 yuan. The trend is expected to continue to fall, as there are rumors of forced redemption of collateral.</p>

<p>Due to the gradual shortage of products from factories, the inventory of woolen fabrics continued to decrease, and sentiment was strong. Prices were generally expected to rise. Holders of goods were reluctant to sell cheaply. All kinds of woolen fabrics and serge saw price increases. Trading was very limited. It was rumored that the industry association suddenly refused to accept large orders yesterday, and sentiment among buyers and sellers turned weak. It is expected that formal trading will resume after the Lunar New Year. Yesterday's market prices are listed below: Yousheng Golden Bear brand rain cloth 27 yuan, Daming rain serge 24 yuan, Rentai Orangutan Tarzan raincoat 30 yuan, Yinfeng French shirt lining 6.5 yuan, Mingfeng gray soft lining 7.5 yuan, Yinfeng Caishen Huma pants wool 300 yuan, Yinfeng Caishen Camel Siskin 385 yuan, Yihe Five Fortune Pictures feather yarn 175 yuan, Yongxing High Jump Picture thin flannel 210 yuan, Shanghai Yuanzang colored Hailin stick 190 yuan.</p>

<p>The coal inventory in Pudong and Puxi warehouses is abundant, and the supply is continuous, so the market is very stable. It is known that on the 16th of this month, another Yongchang vessel loaded with 3,900 tons of Kailuan Tong coal from Qinhuangdao, stopped at buoys 29-30 in the Huangpu River. It was ordered by the Shanghai Water and Fire Company and only started unloading yesterday. As for other coal, such as Huainan coal and Jiaozuo coal, they are transported by rail from Jinpu and Hainan. Recently, they have also continued to arrive in port, so the Huainan coal in the Beipiao warehouse is piled up like mountains. The Jiaozuo and other coal blocks in the Maigen Road warehouse in the Suzhou River are also sufficiently stocked. It is rumored that goods from Taiwan and Shandong will also arrive in port soon.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Large Batch of Firewood to Arrive: Transported from Jiaxing <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Since the authorities in the Zhejiang Hangzhou and Jiaxing clean-up areas banned the loading and export of firewood, the supply to Shanghai has been greatly affected. However, Shanghai firewood merchants have already purchased and completed transactions in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and other places, and are preparing to load ships to transport firewood to Shanghai. In Jiaxing alone, there are hundreds of ships. According to news from Shanghai firewood merchants, this batch of firewood waiting to be transported has been applied to the local authorities by the firewood merchants, and a flexible solution has been reached. It can be loaded and transported to Shanghai within a day or two. Therefore, during this Lunar New Year, a large batch of firewood can still arrive in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The circulation of 36-foot large Guangpi is exhausted, and the supply cannot meet the demand. Yesterday, city gate shops were actively trading. Sentiment among the industry was bullish. Standard market prices soared. However, due to price controls, the price remained at 20,000 yuan per ton. Other head and blank goods were also priced high due to shortages. Currently, the No. 12 to No. 14 colored head goods are sold at 14,500 yuan per ton, the No. 20 color is sold at 16,000 yuan per ton, and iron blanks are also sold at 16,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Tianjin red dates have been slightly tight in the recent market, but due to silver loans, prices are weaker. Yesterday, the Tianjin gang opened up one hundred and several dozen bags of Leling goods, such as extra-large date kings at 750 yuan, date kings at 700 yuan, date heads at 650 yuan, and first households at 650 yuan, all according to Tianjin specifications.</p>

<p>Most of the lime used in building materials is produced in Yixing. However, in recent years, the arrival of Yixing lime has been interrupted for a long time. It relies only on the production of Songjiang suburbs and local kilns to meet market sales. However, its shipments are not as large as Yixing's, and the recent increases in rice, labor, and fuel have also increased costs. In addition, the inconvenience of transportation due to the clean-up of the inland areas has made the arrival of goods increasingly rare. The retail sales in this street have averaged 20-30 loads per day in the north and south. The overall market price rose again by 3-4 yuan per load yesterday. The current inter-industry tearing price among traders is 64-5 yuan per load. Brick and lime shops sell at 71-2 yuan per load.</p>

<h3 id="e76">More on Su Qin <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Xinsheng</p>
<p>Regarding Su Qin, I still have more to say after my previous article, so I'm writing more now.</p>
<p>When the Records of the Grand Historian recorded Su Qin's triumphant scene passing through Luoyang, after the phrase "...this one person's body, if rich and honorable, then relatives fear him, if poor and lowly, then they despise him, let alone the masses?" these two sentences followed:</p>
<p>"If I had two qing of suburban fields in Luoyang, how could I wear the seals of the six states?"</p>
<p>These two sentences are also said by Su Qin. I still don't want to fully discuss Su Qin's character in this article. We only feel that these two sentences contain profound meaning.</p>
<p>If Su Qin really had two qing of suburban fields in Luoyang, his life would of course be comfortable. If life is comfortable, would he still bother to think? The things of persuading the King of Qin, persuading the King of Zhao, Su Qin's life would not have existed at all. There may eventually be someone who advocates "horizontal alliance," but it will never be Su Qin. There may eventually be someone who wears the seals of the six states, but it will never be Su Qin.</p>
<p>Su Qin was a "scholar from a poor alley who dug at the door and made hinges from mulberry households." Before he persuaded the King of Qin, he had never ceased to envy those who had two qing of suburban fields in Luoyang. When he returned home in disappointment after his ten attempts to persuade the King of Qin failed, he had never ceased to covet those who had two qing of suburban fields in Luoyang. If, when he was "pulling the awl to pierce his thigh," he had suddenly made a fortune and had two qing of suburban fields, I think Su Qin might have given up the idea of persuading the King of Zhao and enjoyed the blessings of a big landlord for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>When he wore the seal of the prime minister and passed through Luoyang, he felt that his position was far beyond the reach of those big landlords in Luoyang. Su Qin was full of ambition, so he said these two sentences: "If I had two qing of suburban fields in Luoyang, how could I wear the seals of the six states?" Su Qin was in the golden age of his individualism at that time, "so he scattered a thousand gold to bestow upon his relatives and friends." At that time, the relatives and friends envied Su Qin, secretly regretting that they were not as good as Su Qin, and encouraging their children to emulate Su Qin; that can be imagined. As for those who were jealous of Su Qin's wealth and honor, or those who did not approve of Su Qin's character, they certainly hoped that Su Qin would fail soon, or hoped that the "horizontal alliance" of the six states would not succeed, or even hoped that the Qin state would send troops to destroy the six states; such a complex psychology can also be imagined.</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign history is full of records of heroes and outstanding figures. These heroes and outstanding figures, when they have not yet been developed, indeed rarely have "two qing of suburban fields." Therefore, every time they succeed personally, they often unintentionally utter words similar to what Su Qin said, "If I had two qing of suburban fields in Luoyang, how could I wear the seals of the six states?" to express their pride and greatness.</p>
<p>The success of people like Su Qin certainly depends on their personal talents and efforts, but it is also largely due to the environment. These "heroes," after succeeding at the right time, often become self-righteous and regard themselves as "supermen." And those who seek something from them deify them even more, elevating them to the thirty-third heaven. From then on, the world is full of troubles!</p>
<h3 id="e77">On Essay Contests <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Qiji</p>
<p>Reading the foreword to the essay contest in this newspaper, there are words such as "the oldest (referring to the contestant) is sixty-four years old, and the youngest is twelve years old," which makes one respectfully admire. I wonder if this sixty-four-year-old elder is Mr. Jia Suxiang, who is listed in the second tier, because I know that Mr. Jia is also an old gentleman in his sixties. Mr. Jia is a well-known senior educator. In ordinary circumstances, people of his qualifications and age often refuse to participate in micro-essay contests or compete with young juniors for a day's short-term advantage. In this area, we Chinese people value face the most, thinking that if one fails to be selected, it is as if a general who has fought on the battlefield for a long time is defeated by an unknown soldier, wouldn't it be a laughingstock. Now Mr. Jia is uniquely able to break this prejudice and resolutely participate. This time he was selected, and in the eyes of ordinary people, he has not lost face; however, I guess that even if he had failed to be selected, he would not be annoyed or feel that he has no face to see anyone from now on.</p>
<p>We know that participating in a contest is one thing, and being selected or failing is another thing; if one is afraid of failing and does not participate, then who can guarantee that they will definitely be selected? Wouldn't the result be that no one dares to participate? Mr. Jia has seen through this point, so whether he is selected or not, he does not care at all. This spirit is truly a model for the younger generation, calling on us to go forward bravely in everything and not worry too much. I do not know Mr. Jia personally, and the purpose of writing this article is not to praise him personally, but to admire his spirit, so I express it and encourage myself and all readers.</p>
<h3 id="e78">The Model Teacher for All Generations <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>The entire faculty objected to this proposal. If the school were to express its opinion, it would probably also object. Everyone believed that the children in the East End were small hooligans, otherwise they would have to be made restrained and uncomfortable; in any case, there would definitely be "accidents," and everyone would be thrown into chaos and very unhappy. But Katherine insisted.</p>
<p>"Chips," she said, "they're all wrong, you know, and I'm right. I'm looking forward to the future, while you and they are looking back to the past. England will not always be divided into official families and 'other classes.' Those Poplar children are just as important to England as Brookfield is. You should invite them, Chips. If you only sign a few guineas' checks for them but refuse to get close to them, you can't satisfy your conscience. Also, they are proud of Brookfield—just like you are. Years from now, maybe those children will come here—in any case, some of them will. Why not? Why not ever? Chips, dear, remember, this is 1997—1967, the year you went to Cambridge. The ideas you gained are deeply attached to those days, and they are all good ideas, in large numbers. But a few—only a few, Chips—can no longer be attached..."</p>
<p>Perhaps to her surprise, he obeyed and suddenly enthusiastically approved of the proposal, so the situation changed greatly, so that the authorities unexpectedly felt that they had to agree to that dangerous experiment. The Poplar children came to Brookfield one Saturday afternoon and played against the school's second team in soccer, resulting in a 7-5 loss, which was still glorious. After the game, they ate a meaty tea with the school team in the dining hall. Then they met the principal, were led around the school, and in the evening, Chips saw them off at the train station. Everything went smoothly, without any involvement. Apparently, what the visitors took away was the same good impression as what they left behind. (14)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Review of Li Shaochun's "Washing Floating Mountain" <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Li Shaochun's performance at the Tianchan Theater this time is sure to be a hit, which was already expected, because he performs well in both civil and martial dramas, and he is willing to put in the effort. Each performance is also a double bill of important plays. For his third performance, "Washing Floating Mountain," my young friend Mr. Chen went to see it and was quite satisfied. Shaochun, playing He Tianbao, wears a soft silk hat, a pleated jacket, thin-soled quick boots, and the black three-piece set. His costume is exactly the same as in the Shi Gong An (Cases of Judge Shi) dramas. He has a pair of swords on his back. This is a common hero's attire, but when Shaochun plays it, his entrance with the horse, every move and posture, feels just right. The horse whip, the tossing of the beard, all have measure, which proves his skill is pure and refined. Later, when entering Floating Mountain, the several fights with the bandits were executed with roundness, stability, clarity. There was room beneath his legs. He was quick but not fiery, slow but not sluggish. Every decisive pose was very beautiful, not too conventional, thankfully shedding the crude air of a martial actor. Someone said that his martial arts are not as solid as Chuande Wei's, but I don't agree. Chuande is a purely martial actor, his strength lies in his courage and strength. Li's approach is to perform martial dramas with civil acting techniques, which is a different kind of transmission. The strength is different. It's like boxing, Chuande is the Shaolin school, Li is the Wudang school. Both are certainly good, but they take different paths. I heard that Shaochun's martial arts were learned from Li Yongli, and Yongli's skills were obtained from Yang Xiaolou. Xiaolou learned the Chen family style of Tai Chi from Henan, the orthodox Chen family Tai Chi. I have personally witnessed it. Tai Chi is the Wudang internal school of boxing, emphasizing internal strength with external softness. Xiaolou was able to perform martial dramas with civil acting techniques because of this. If someone says that Shaochun was personally taught by Yu Shuyan, that is deceptive talk. I don't believe it. Shuyan has been ill for many years, too lazy to move, and he treats his art as a treasure, unwilling to pass it on. Even if Shuyan was willing to personally teach Shaochun, I'm afraid he wouldn't reach that level. Now, let's talk about Shaochun's singing. I heard him sing the Zheng Erhuang and Fan Erhuang sections of He Tianbao's ghost dream, and I feel that although his voice is good, his singing technique is not yet perfect. The words are not yet clear enough, and the singing style is not yet stable and practiced enough. I have always maintained that "singing is more difficult than martial arts, and civil dramas are more difficult than martial dramas." Just look at a child in the opera school. In a few years, his martial arts and martial dramas can be passable, but when it comes to singing civil dramas, it's simply unbearable. This is an ironclad proof. Shaochun has been practicing opera for more than ten years, and his martial dramas are very impressive, but his singing is still a bit short. To put it in fancy language, "Building a mountain nine ren high, one basket of earth spoils the whole." I hope Shaochun will pursue his singing further, so that he can become a versatile actor. As for purely martial dramas, it's best to perform them less, as excessive sweating is detrimental to the voice. Shaochun visited my humble abode a few days ago. Looking at his face, he was very serene, and his eyes were also introverted. He is a very promising young artist, and perhaps he can tolerate my humble words.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Pascal Asks Someone to Prove Atmospheric Pressure - One of the Letters of Famous Scientists in the World <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Lineoln Schuster, Translated by Gu Xin</p>
<p>Previous Cause</p>
<p>The following brief talks about the measurement of the pressure on a mercury column. The matter is very simple, and it may seem uninteresting, but it points out the true spirit of scientific research, so we can't help but choose it. This famous scientist, Blaise Pascal, was a French mystic, philosopher, and mathematician. In this brief, he shows how he "used his ideas for rigorous exploration and experimental work."</p>
<p>Pascal was born in 1623, and his most famous work is "Pensées," which was translated into English in 1850 as "Thoughts on Religion and Evidences of Christianity." However, he is equally famous in the scientific world. He was the founder of modern probability theory, the inventor of Pascal's triangle, and he also contributed to the advancement of differential calculus. His scientific work in the measurement of atmospheric pressure is also important. His experiments added to the knowledge of atmospheric pressure and fluid equilibrium.</p>
<p>He had predicted "the simple and commonplace fact that the air pressure on the top of a mountain is smaller than the pressure in the valley below," and he believed that only through experiments could his prediction be proven or refuted. Therefore, he wrote the following letter to his (sister's) husband (or brother-in-law) Florin Perier:</p>
<p>"...to bother you with all sorts of questions in physics..."</p>
<p>This Text</p>
<p>I venture to interrupt your daily special work and bother you with all sorts of questions in physics, because I know they will give you rest and recreation in your leisure time... The question now concerns the famous experiment, which is to use a tube filled with mercury, first at the foot of the mountain, then at the top of the mountain, several times within the same day, in order to determine whether the height of the mercury column is the same or different in these two situations... Because the air at the foot of the mountain is much heavier than the air at the top of the mountain, this is certain.</p>
<p>Consequences</p>
<p>Almost a year later, on September 22, 1648, Pascal received the following reply from Perier:</p>
<p>"I have finally completed the experiment you have long been expecting... On the top of Puy-de-Dome mountain... we saw that the mercury in the tube was 23.2 inches, while in the garden of the monastery at the foot of the mountain, it was 26.25 inches.

<h3 id="e82">Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association Assists Charitable Organizations in Distributing Clothing <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Recently, prices have been high, and it has been extremely difficult for the poor to maintain their livelihoods. Now that severe cold is pressing, it is even more difficult to add cotton clothing. The Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association, having foreseen this, specially commissioned the Shanghai Buddhist Congee Factory in the Old West Gate Guandi Temple in the Nanshi District last autumn to produce 200,000 yuan worth of cotton clothing. They made 4,542 sets of adult cotton clothing and trousers, and 3,001 sets of children's cotton clothing and trousers, to assist various charitable organizations in the city. The distribution has now been completed. The recipients include: Renji Hall 1,000 sets, China Women and Children Relief Association 350 sets, Guangyi Hall 500 sets, Huaiben Hall 400 sets, Poor Children's Home 100 sets, First Baptist Church of Christ 150 sets, Shanghai Orphanage 50 sets, Taijiabao Orphanage 50 sets, Child Welfare Association 300 sets, Bethel Free School 100 sets, Buddhist Layman Forest Relief Association 150 sets, Youyou Nursing Home 100 sets, Shanghai Refugee Nursing Home 200 sets, Fuyou Home 100 sets, Ciji Children's Nursing Home 30 sets, Christian Refugee Nursing Home 70 sets, Jingye Orphanage 100 sets, Disaster Relief Nursing Home 100 sets, Salvation Army 400 sets, Puyuan Society Congee Factory 350 sets, Shanghai Buddhist Congee Factory 670 sets, Jingde Hall 26 sets, Buddhist Agricultural and Industrial Nursing Home 50 sets, Local Court Prison 20 sets. Mr. Rong of the Association, who is in charge of the cotton clothing affairs, distributed 423 sets along the way. This newspaper's Poverty Relief Association was also assisted with 354 sets. There are still 1,400 sets, which are said to be being distributed after the members have been surveyed. The Association is organized by enthusiastic public figures in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles. It is strict in its investigation and careful in its distribution of assistance to charitable organizations. The responsible personnel are all doing their duty. It is said that they plan to do a lot of charitable work, but recently the donations are not enough to distribute. They hope that all sectors will踴躍 donate, which is no different from directly helping the poor and sick.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Saving on Medicine and Clothing Donations <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received 1,000 yuan in national currency from a reader, Ren Weng, specifically for the purpose of donating clothing. The original letter said: "I previously suffered from typhoid fever, and fortunately I have recovered, but my constitution is weak. The doctor strongly advised me to take tonics. I thought that if I could rest a little, it would not be difficult to recover. I could not bear to spend the money on my own tonics. Now that severe winter has arrived, and hunger and cold are rampant, I feel sorry for them. Therefore, I saved 1,000 yuan from my savings and sent it to you to make and distribute cotton clothing, just to do my best." (Editor's note: We will immediately purchase 34 sets and distribute them to elderly and impoverished people.)</p>
