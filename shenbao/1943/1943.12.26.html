<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>日本，雖然業已和中國締結同盟條約，表示為「以平等待中國的民族」，然而大多數中國知識份子，仍然尙未想眞誠衷心與日本「共同奮鬬」，這究竟是什麽道理呢？——一位「支那通」有一天這樣憤憤然向我發問。「眞正學者，是想讀指示眞實事物的書籍；而庸俗學者，只是想讀自己希望那樣記載事物的書籍（辜鴻銘著春秋大義一一一頁）」，道位「支那通」，也不觀察中國知識份子對日的眞正感情，而只是在讀着「自己希望那樣記載的」報吿書，所以才有這樣的發問。中國知識份子的對日感情，決非像這位「支那通」所想像的那樣簡單。雖然英美在大吹大擂，把重慶列入「世界四大强國」，然而中國的知識份子，却很淸楚，現在留美的僑胞，是在怎樣忍受着人種的差別待遇。老實說來，英美人心中唯我獨尊的人種優越感，是根深蒂固，而具有悠久歷史性的，打破這一點，而替亞洲各民族揚眉吐氣者，實在是日本，這一點，中國的知識份子並沒有忘記；因此，如果他們知道了日本眞是「以平等待中國的民族」，則總會高興和日本共同奮鬬的。然而中國的知識份子，決不因日本發表了中日同盟條約，而立刻就趾高氣揚，認為中國業巳與日本立於平等的地位。</p>
<p>一個中國知識份子，曾在某一座談會上對我說過：「日本曾誓言與中國「同生共死」。然而日本人的「配給米」和中國人的「戶口米」，其間相關的量，竟達三分之二以上，那末縱令中國人願意和日本人同死，也不可得，一定會有三分之二的中國人，先比日本人死掉的」。另一個中國知識份子對我說：「日本諾言與中國」「同甘共苦」，但從上海北車站坐火車到南京去旅行，這一段，决談不到日本人和中國人「同甘共苦」的」。又有一位說：「試看上海馬路上，中國人用車搬運煤球，在途中要經過無數檢查，但如和日本人一同走，則通行無阻」。「總而言之，中國人在和平區內，對於日本人，總有一種客氣心理。可是，日本人對於該地的主人翁中國人，並不客氣，就好像中國人僑居外國一樣。所以，對於中國，無論怎樣美其名曰「獨立自主」，但名與實不是相差甚遠麽？」這是最後一位講的。</p>
<p>他們所說的，雖然都是非常小的事情，但却都是中國知識份子最關心的事情，這是用不着懷疑的吧！日本人中有好多人完全不　這類事實，而只管在街頭巷尾的牆壁上，張貼不疼不癢的「同甘共苦」和「同生共死」的標語，認為這就是完成了「興亞工作」。然而眞正的「興亞工作」，首先就是在上面所說的小問題上，使中國人心悅誠服，必須在實際生活中，讓中國人十足兌現地，名實相符地感覺到「獨立自主」。當在「同甘共苦」中，有了名實相符的同甘共苦感覺時，當在「平等」中，有了名實相符的平等感覺時，當在「獨立自主」中，有了名實相符的獨立自主感覺時，中國才能以眞正同生共死的精神，協助日本。（以下轉入第四版）</p>
<h3 id="c2">日大本營昨發表　新不列顚島戰况　襲拉巴爾敵機毀五十八架 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京廿五日中央社電　日大本營廿五日下午四時發表：　帝國海軍航空部隊曾於十二月廿四日未明，轟炸新不列顚島馬加斯角及比萊羅島之敵據點，使一處發生大爆炸，四處發生大火。　帝國海軍航空部隊曾於十二月廿四日上午邀擊來襲拉巴爾之敵機百卅五架，擊落其五十八架，內五架未證實，我機未返基地者六架。</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　美軍在新不列顚島西南方馬加斯角登陸以後，即力謀在該方面設立强力之橋頭堡壘，以維持其補給作戰，同時並加緊空襲拉巴爾，自十五日起至二十三日止，曾派機二百一十餘架來襲，但經日軍邀擊，擊落其五十一架，綜計自十五日起至二十三日止，敵機來襲計共為二百一十餘架，每日平均二十餘架，敵空軍過去每以飛機百架來襲，但最近自敵方在日軍南方主要戰綫附近建設基地以後，敵機來襲架數顯見減少。其尤足注目者為敵機種類複雜，如二十三日來襲之敵機，多半為艦載機，此亦由於敵基地密近日軍軍事要點之戰略布陣之發展所致，但其根本原因，則為敵航空母艦羣，曾在所羅門海域及中部太平洋海域海空戰各役蒙受軍創，自此以後，乃極力避免使航空母艦出擊，現敵軍在新幾內亞東端，以格德納夫特羅布里安烏德拉克島為中心，由波根維爾島。特羅基納方面，展開對新不列顚之攻擊，但該方面乃在日軍制空權下，敵　來攻亦徒增其消耗而已。</p>
<h3 id="c3">謀實現興亞偉業　東京設中日協會　近衛任總裁明年一月成立 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日本前內閣總理大臣近衛文　氏，最近曾於東亞同文會機關報（中國月刋）十二月二十日中發表一文，題為「關於大東亞宣言」，闡述其意見，略謂吾人努力體諒大東亞宣言及中日同盟之本旨，同時並切望展開一大運動，使此種與亞大精神普遍滲透於大東亞十億民族。茲近衛氏為謀中日相互瞭解中，實現與亞大精神滲透全東亞之偉業起見，决意創立「中日協會」而獻身於新運動。聞該會將於明年一月下旬成立，其旨趣為在精神上實現大東亞宣言及中日同盟，並分担與亞之使命，故中日兩國政府均决定積極予以支援，中國方面屆時亦將參加該會。聞總裁一職將由近衛氏担任，並將網羅阿部信行大將。荒木貞夫大將。浠井柳太郎氏等朝野名士參加，故其陣容極為强盛。該會為法人組織，除受中日兩國政府支援外，並承中日志士捐助經費約達一千萬元、現决定以東京都　町某氏公館及目黑雅叙園為中日協會本部及迎賓館而展開活動。</p>
<h3 id="c4">大東亞文學家會　明年在華舉行　作家協會積極籌組中 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>南京廿五日中央社電　自戰時文化宣傳政策綱要發表後，我國戰時文化建設問題，即漸為各方所注意。現悉文學方面有關人士，正迅速着手準備，擬組織文學作家協會（假定名稱。）蓋第三屆大東亞文學家大會，巳定來年在我國舉行，故我國南北各地文學作家，即擬組織團體，設立全國性之協會。北平方面北大文學系沈啓无等，華北作家協會柳龍光等，即曾有所協議。並有新民印書館蔣義方參加，决定取消現有機構，準備作將來作家協會之分會。且已推舉以上三人為起草委員，着手起草協會草案。又上海方面，亦已於本月中旬，由周化人·局越然·陶晶蓀·魯風·丘石木·柳雨生等舉行集會商討，日本文學報國會事務局長久米正雄，及阿部知二與草野心平三氏亦曾列席。協議結果，决定於年內函約各方發起，在京集議，就華北方面所擬協會草案，加以檢討，决定規程後，即定明年有舉行成立大會。國府宣傳部因此事對於戰時文化宣傳政策綱要之推進，有甚大之補助，故决定予以最大援助。又聞該協會成立後，將在南京·上海·北平·漢口·廣州·等各重要都市，設立分會，事務局設於南京抑上海尙未决定。但將由各分會選舉委員，組織委員會，此委員會所决定之事項，即交由事務局處理。</p>
<p>草野心平發表談話</p>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　第三屆大東亞文學者大會，已决定明年在我國舉行，我國南方各地文學作家，亦擬組織文學團體，設立全國倌之協會。記者為明瞭日本文學報國會工作情况，及對我國組織文學團體之意見，特訪問盟邦日本詩人草野心平，承其發表談話，大意謂：「當中日事變之際，日本雖有多數文學團體，但其時並無一統一文學國體之組織。及至大東亞戰爭發生後，各文學團體始行解散，而重行組織「日本文學報國會」，會員共約五千餘人。該會雖為民間團體，但內閣情報局，大政翼贊會，軍報道部，大東亞省等政府機關，均為該會後援。因此該會得各機關之援助，對大東亞戰爭，有甚大貢獻。回顧中國文學，於事變前，雖甚活潑，但並無一個中心，其促進民族之自覺，亦不過抗日思想而已。値此建設大東亞理想之際，中國文學團體團結起來，組織統一文學國體，對此應加以積極活動，實有其必要。而且中日兩國為大東亞新文化之建設中心，尤為吾人所深切希望。中國作家協會成立後，與日本文學報國會，當有密切聯絡。因此吾人對大東亞新文化之發展，實寄有莫大之希望與期待。吾人相信此新文學理念之開始，當以中日兩國為始，而世界新文學之活動，幷當以中日兩國為矯矢。記者復詢以對中日兩國新文學之感想，據云，中國實無眞正新文學之思想。蓋事變前旣有普羅文學，馬克斯共產等紛亂思想，而事變後，對和平思想亦欠堅定。及至經過大東亜戰爭參戰。接收租界三個階段，始對和平有深切認識，而發揚新文學之思想。中日兩國以往新文學思想之路綫相同，此後密切聯絡後，東亞新文學前途，實有莫大希望也。</p>

<p>日本在燦爛的耀煌戰果裏，在戰略上日益建立起絕對不敗，百戰百勝的態勢；為了呼應這一點，滿洲國則鎭守着大東亞共榮圈方安寗，在增强戰力的至上命令下，努力確立日本和滿洲的食糧自給態勢；十月底，武部總務長官東上，與日本商討的結果。日本滿洲在緊密的協力之下，成立了農地造成緊急事業案。這以前，滿洲國方面獨自進行的既着手工事，業已大功告成，以及日滿合辦的新工事等，也迅速付諸實施，所以未滿兩三年，日本，朝鮮，滿洲，華北各地區的食糧自給業已整備完好。</p>
<p>這就是說，按滿洲農地造成第一次四年計畫，是從前年開始進行的。飲馬河，岔路口（吉林省），黑台（東安省），綏化（北安省），對立（三江省），盤山，新立屯（錦州省），濱江等防水開發，以及其他實在成績，都有相常收獲，同時正在努力促進，以求將來的二年內，必然取得空前成果。一方面按新定計盡逐漸具體實行的地區、就是以第二松花江的吉林省扶餘街為中心的上下流約二十公里的沿岸地區，且預定四平省梨樹縣滴打幫子附近，再加上業已着手的部扮，於是新的開拓熟地完全成功了。</p>
<p>第二松花江地區，將在後年，總面積的一半，將按計畫實行生產，至一九四六年，務使其能全部生產，這就是目前强制實仃重點工事的所在。開拓糧局和滿洲土地開發等。業已選定幹綫水路的位置，及其他現地調查工作，與此相平行應常作的，就是目前在積極準備資材，工事，勢動力等確保工作，以待明年開工。</p>
<p>這個第二松花扛岸水田造成的特徵，由於地勢關係，預定將專用抽水機灌溉，因此扶餘街　　第二松花江兩岸地帶，配備看口徑〇公尺的大抽水機〇〇架，正如進攻英美的要塞一樣在排列着，眞可以說是壯觀之至。</p>
<p>此外至東遠河滴打輩子，根據流水調整原則，　交通部和開拓總局的指導下，以統制水利，對於東遼河中流地區的廣義的沃田野，不至再受洪水氾　之苦。下流江岸的濕地亞爾家地帶，則加以改良，使成為水田。從今年十一月底，對於本年度工事，又迫加預算八十六萬元。此等工事，向來關於咨材和技術方面，總有種種困難，但因此次日滿兩國相互援助，所謂解決工事關鍵的抽水機，電動機等機械類，業巳實行優先的分配，甚至日本土地開發團體等的技術援助，也可以期待得到了。</p>
<p>大東亞相的談話</p>
<p>對於滿洲國緊急農地造成計盡的協力援助，於二十二日的內閣會議上，已經正式決定了帝國政府的根本方針，這一點正如情報局所發表的一樣。滿</p>
<p>此外，重要資材，並非單純依賴日本，且計畫增强國內生產，以及轉用游　資材等。同時這裏所需要的勞動力，今年夏天也曾收獲到偉大成果，博得好評。以滿洲國勸勞奉公隊為中心，而在强制動員地方的勞力。</p>
<p>隨着這個大事業的遜展，而開拓土地的進軍也毫不浪費時間地開始工作了，希以日本內地人口向滿洲殖民，以及利用勤勞奉公隊，再使留滿朝鮮游　農民，或滿洲農民積極加以協力，與開　工作運結起來，以求猛力增產。洲國朝野，集結總力，以求增產食糧，專心供給日本作戰，對於這一點，是我衷心感激之至的。目前拿食糧供求的關係上說，滿洲國的食糧供給基地使命，愈發具有重大性，對於今後滿洲國食糧的飛躍增產，是有很大期待的。滿洲國政府為了積極適應這種要求，不僅對於過去所從事的各種施策，應更加澈底强化，同時再確實建立有效的增產對策之劃時代農地造成計　。為了完成日滿相互的協力，日前武部總務長官等人業已晋京請示，政府立刻根據現地情形，由關係事務當局加以檢討，因意見一致，最後便於二十二日內閣會議上，加以附議，對於本計畫的協力援助，便決定了基本方針。</p>
<p>此次緊急幾地造成計畫，明年閉始着手，於一九四五年完成，僅僅以雨年的短期問，不僅能在　二松花江地區以及東遠河地區，造成新的水田，且完成實施既定造成計畫地區。當成功的那一矢，其生產物又可供給日本國家，對於日本人民的食糧需要上說，實將有莫大的供默。然而為了成功，只就土地造成關係上，也還需要投下巨額經費與累計千萬人的勞動力，且必須拋入相當數量的資材機器和技術。帝國攻府鹽於這一事業的意義偉大與效果有力，所以決心積極參盡，協力和完成其資金，資材，技術等各方面充足。</p>
<p>為了實行這件事情，雖然可以想像得到今後將並到許多困難，但為了完成這一點，則須强化日滿兩國的積極合作，以及深望關係各方面切的實理解與眞　協力。</p>
<p>按照該計畫的實施，日本和滿洲的整個食糧需要問題，可以美滿解決，在決戰時期下，眞可以銳是不幸中的幸事。（石岩歸自一九四三年十一月二十三日每日新聞）</p>

<p>聞蘭亭氏致歡送詞</p>
<p>「今天我們舉行茶會，歡送岩井先生榮轉廣東之任，岩井先生在日本大使館的官階雖然不是最高，可是他自從到上海同文書院求學，在上海領事館服務，已經多年，最熟悉中國人的個性以及一般的風俗習慣，因此與我們中國各界人士，在友誼上都非常親熱，今一且分別，特別感覺依依惜別。</p>
<p>岩井先生對於公事，一點也不馬虎，可是，同時還顧到友誼，對於友誼，固然非常親熱，可是同時還顧到公事，我們今天特別感覺依依不捨的，就在岩井先生這些態度的長處。</p>
<p>因此我們就想到中日官民之間的往還，只講公事而不顧友誼，是不够的，只講友誼而不顧公事，當然也是不够的，我們很希望岩井先生雖然離開我們，不久的將來，再回到上海來，同時更希望岩井先生這種公事及誼的態度，永遠融和在中日官民之間，敬祝岩井先生旅途平安，前途無量。」次</p>
<p>岩井書記官致謝詞</p>
<p>略謂此次本人奉命調任廣東，承蒙諸位熱誠歡送，殊為感謝，又聆聞蘭亭先生的歡送詞，更為感謝。此次承諸位歡送，亦為夢想不到之事。本人過去三分之一的時間，由熱情之學生時代至一生最寶貴之靑壯年時代，咸消　於上海。上海可說是中日雙方親善之中心地，也可說在中日親善上在上海可得到一效果，所以過去想在上海努力奮門，努力工作，本人對上海有一個信念，能達到中日眞正親善的目的。所以十餘年來直到現在何日不在上海努力工作，但因才疏學淺，不能得到完好的成績，不過下了極大的希望，而繼續努力，務使得到眞正親善。上海可說是我第二故鄉，也可說是第一個故鄉，我想一經在上海服務，上海道地方無論政治經濟文化都是中日雙方頂重要的地方，在這裏努力工作，推而至及全國，可達到中日親善眞正和平的日的，而想不到今天在道裏歡送。但本人奉命後，深加考慮，因國家事大，即犧牲了自己的信念到廣東去，不過當局了解我的心理，所以不久將來就可回來。因此今天承諸位歡送，不久將來就要不客氣的說受諸位歡迎，最後希望諸位能在上海努力工作，諸位都知道上海現在處於十分困難地步，譬如雜糧運輸交通，都很困難，要解决這問題，政府當要負責，可是在座各位不但為上海，而且為全國甚至中日雙方有力有權威的人仕，都能有力解决而負起責任來，倘能努力的話，一定能達到解决各項困難的目的，本人不日赴粵，未及與各位一一吿辭，深為抱歉，在這裏向各位謝謝云云。繼由</p>

<p>云：岩井先生行將離開上海，我們一班朋友，沒一個不是從心坎深處，發出一種依依不捨的情緒，不單囚為常常見面，常常叙談，一旦分離，覺得不勝悵惘，而岩井先生的待人接物，和藹可親，不獨沒有異國人的　覺，就是同國人間自家兄弟亦很少這樣的親愛誠　，今日的歡送會，實不足以表示萬分之一呢。我要想揮寫我們熱烈的情緒實在不能不舉例，不如把他的姓名四個字分析闡發，來得天然有趣，第一個字是岩字，岩是山石，不論是火成岩水成岩，永久是厚重端正，絕不因外物的優襲，改變他的寂然不動的本質，這是表示岩井先生靜的時候，井是人人汲水的源淵，他能給我們適量的溫潤，而且不汲水不見多，嬮汲水不見少，這寬宏大度，剛剛表示岩井先生動的時候，眞是象徵着欣欣向榮扶搖直上的意思，岩井先生雖巳屆中年，而英氣勃然，正與靑年無異，中國有句老話，英雄難過「美人關」，岩井先生遇到美人，比任何人來得一往情深，一是心口如一，岩井先生的人格，說一是一，從來沒有聽到他浮滑一類的話，所謂「劃一不二」，就是岩井先生的金字招牌，所以岩井英一四個字，把他的全貌，統統刻畫出來，比攝影還要淸楚，我們敬重他，也就為這四個字。</p>
<p>最後由聞蘭亭代表工商聯誼會，市民福利協會致贈岩井氏大號銀杯一只，上鐫「鵬程萬里」四字，留作紀念。張一鵬贈親撰立軸上書送別詩「　　風流上國賓，每邀促膝話和親，居然傾蓋成知已，頗覺停杯愧主人，東亞文明同信仰，大和武道見精神，嶺南不似陽　遠，小別歸來正早春」。當由岩井一一接受致謝，攝影，此滿溢熱烈情緒之歡送茶會，至六時半始散。</p>

<h3 id="c41">譯評　對米統會的期待 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>鑒於食糧問題的重大性，或許我們對於米統會的期待過大，認為關於食米一項，除信賴唯一的米　統制機關米統會以外，別無其他方法·然而數月來米統會的成績，决不能說是滿意。</p>
<p>據米統會發表，該會所收買的米之總量，甲乙兩區合計達一百四十萬石，一般人對食糧配給抱着不安的理由，完全不存在。使一般人如此不安者，由於米的私運及黑市的不能絕跡，而最近如蘇州，無錫等地黑市的騰貴亦為事實。私運的不能絕跡，雖或由於行政機關取締的不嚴厲，但米統會亦有若干責任。如與行政機關的關係更趨密切，則此等問題自然解决。</p>
<p>各都市私運米的犯獗及黑市的騰貴，使今後米的收買大感困難。那不是單由取締所能消滅的。要强化取締，至少須先在上海增加配給米使足食，在蘇州，無錫，南通等地樹立新的配給制；登記存米，取締國積。然而使米業者實施自主的米穀統制，結果，有使業者借統制之名實行囤積的危險。</p>
<p>且米統會所指定的若干收買商中，似有若干投機分子存在，此在乙區尤甚。指定收買商中注目於米統會所規定的利益以外者，不會沒有。私運和黑市大都由此等人所策動。所以米統會要完成本來的使命，必須整理此種分子。</p>
<p>食糧問題的重大性，茲無待贅述。但問題的本質，並非是食糧的絕對量不足，而為收買配給的困難。要合理的解决食糧問題，至少我們以為應採取上述措置。（翔：節譯大陸新報）</p>

<p>一般外國人往往說，中國是理智生活落後的國家，很多日本人也待有這種見解。如果以理智生活道一名詞為科學生活，論理生活的話，那末這一批評在某種程度上或許是正確的。中國人，决不能說是具有論理的理智生活的，然而另一方面，一般人却幾乎忘記了，中國人在這悠久的五千年內，過着感情生活——借辜鴻銘的話來說，即是「心的生活A　Life　of　The　Heart」——，中國人並不是用「頭」來思索的國民，而是用「心」來思案的國民。因此，中國人縱使頭是瞭解了原委，而心如果尙不諒解，那末仍是枉然的。如果因為中國人不用頭思索，就用對付其他半開化人種的態度來對付中國人，那就大錯而特錯了。中國人的五千年悠久「心的生活」，縱或不能理解事物的論理，但却會給中國人以辨別眞實的能力。「辨別眞實」，就是區別名與實，是否相符的意思。中國人對於事物在買際感覺前，是不相信的。用頭思索，而按論理行動的日木人，以為日本既與中國同盟，那就是日本以平等待中國，所以中國人的對日感情，應當按照這一理論而迅速改變。然而用心思索，而按「熱情」行動的中國人，如果沒有和日本人名實相符的平等感覺，則並不以為中日　巳眞正問盟，道母寗用一句日本話來形容，「總不落於肺腑（總有些懷疑之意—譯者）」之感。實際上，這種感情，就是使他們懷疑中日同盟的背後，有某種不光明物存在的心理基礎。</p>
<p>假如日本着重於這種中國知識份子的心理，而能澈底賜與他們以名實相符的自主與平等，我敢相信，重慶不必說，甚至中國共產黨的靑年們，也會歡天喜地地擁　日本，且會以滿腔熱血，爭取大東亞戰爭的最後勝利。中國的知識份子，决不反對日本所提倡的「亞洲人的亞洲」，同時，他們深深感覺到，與日本携手駢肩，共同完成解放亞洲的神聖事業，就是中國的民族天職。然而他們認為，為了實現「亞洲人的亞洲」以前，首先必須實現「中國人的中國」，同時他們認為，「中國解放」過程，就是「亞洲解放」過程。因此，他們對於自己的祖國，愈發感覺到是十足兌現的「中國人的中國」時，則對亞洲解放戰爭，當然也愈發增加熱情。中國的知識份子，對於大東亞戰爭决不是消極的，當然也不是失掉熱情的。他們對於亞洲解放的熱情，雖然在心坎上熊熊地燃燒着，但現在道種熱情，因對日本發生疑懼，所以，便不能不收歛起來。內心熱戀一個男人的處女，在該男人的面前，總是不大張口講話，不有所表情，恰如不喜歡這個男人一樣。原因就是她尙未眞正判斷他是愛自己的，在未判斷前，盡量不使自己的熱情洩露出去。他如能解除了她的這一疑問，那末她立刻就會跳到他的懷裏。日本也像這個男人一樣，如果知道中國內心裏燃燒的熱情，且能瞬息間解除了中國的疑問，則中國立刻就跳到日本的懷裏。然而這種場合上的日本，縱令像天字第一號戀愛戰術家董·福安那樣，以誇大的姿態，說「我絕對愛妳」，而只要這句話不十足兌現，不名實相符，則中國的知識份子會享以閉門羹的。想要花言巧語說服中國知識份子，日本對中國則不宜採取「輕佻的戀愛法」。尊重對方的人格，不要認為是發泄性慾的對象，打算以對方為終身伴侶，率直說，並不是打算納妾，而必須迎之為正室。在這一點上，中國的知識份子，我認為說是很像具有豐富戀愛經騐的老密斯，這尤為恰當。她們聽到男人的甜言蜜語的時候，她們便首先想知道這些話中有多少眞實性，言語越甜蜜，而越想知道葫蘆裏是賣的什麽藥，以免受騙。想取信這位老密斯，並不是用言語，而是在日常生活中，甚至瑣碎小事也要表現誠摯，必須以男人的真心來加以感動。日本想爭取中國的知識份子，則必須在日常生活的小問題上，讓他們深切地感覺到日本的誠意，更進一步，讓他們十足兌現地，名實相符地感覺到中日同盟。</p>
<p>孔子說過：「大畏民志，此謂知本，此謂知之至也」。按辜鴻銘的解釋，意思就是說，「像懼怕民衆的心一樣的關懷，就是教育事業的基本，同時也是最高的教育」。然而我認為這一句的意思，如解釋作「懼怕民衆的心，注意民衆的心，就是文化工作的基本，同時也是最高的目標」，這或許更好些。（漢譯）</p>

<p>— Yoshida Tosuke</p>
<p>Japan, although it has already concluded an alliance treaty with China, declaring "equality for the Chinese people," the majority of Chinese intellectuals still do not genuinely and wholeheartedly want to "fight together" with Japan. What is the reason for this? - A "China expert" once angrily asked me this question. "True scholars want to read books that point to the truth of things; while vulgar scholars only want to read books that record things as they hope they are (Gu Hongming, The Spirit of the Chinese Civilization, page 111)," this "China expert" does not observe the genuine feelings of Chinese intellectuals towards Japan, but only reads reports that "record things as they hope they are," hence such a question. The feelings of Chinese intellectuals towards Japan are definitely not as simple as this "China expert" imagines. Although the United Kingdom and the United States are loudly trumpeting and including Chongqing among the "world's four major powers," Chinese intellectuals are very clear about how Chinese expatriates in the United States are enduring racial discrimination. Frankly speaking, the Anglo-Americans' sense of racial superiority is deeply rooted and has a long history. It is Japan that has broken this and raised the profile of Asian nations. Chinese intellectuals have not forgotten this; therefore, if they knew that Japan was truly "treating the Chinese people equally," they would always be happy to fight together with Japan. However, Chinese intellectuals will never immediately become arrogant simply because Japan has announced the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, believing that China has already stood on an equal footing with Japan.</p>
<p>A Chinese intellectual once said to me at a symposium: "Japan has vowed to 'live and die together' with China. However, the related amount between Japanese 'rationed rice' and Chinese 'household rice' is more than two-thirds. In that case, even if the Chinese are willing to die together with the Japanese, it is impossible. Two-thirds of the Chinese people will definitely die before the Japanese." Another Chinese intellectual said to me: "Japan promises to 'share weal and woe' with China, but traveling by train from the North Shanghai Railway Station to Nanjing, there is absolutely no talk of Japanese and Chinese 'sharing weal and woe.'" Yet another said: "Look at Shanghai's roads. When Chinese people transport coal briquettes by car, they have to go through countless inspections on the way, but if they walk with Japanese people, they can pass without hindrance." "In short, Chinese people in the Peace Zone always have a sense of politeness towards the Japanese. However, the Japanese are not polite to the Chinese, the masters of the land, as if the Chinese are living abroad. Therefore, no matter how beautifully China is described as 'independent and autonomous,' isn't the difference between name and reality very far?" This was said by the last person.</p>
<p>What they say are all very small things, but they are all things that Chinese intellectuals care about most, there is no need to doubt that! There are many Japanese people who completely ignore these kinds of facts and only stick "sharing weal and woe" and "living and dying together" slogans on the walls of streets and alleys, thinking that this is the completion of "Asia Development Work." However, the real "Asia Development Work" is first of all to make the Chinese people sincerely convinced on the small issues mentioned above, and to make the Chinese people fully realize, in actual life, and feel that "independence and autonomy" are consistent with reality. When there is a feeling of genuine "sharing weal and woe" in "sharing weal and woe," when there is a feeling of equality in "equality" that is consistent with reality, and when there is a feeling of independence and autonomy in "independence and autonomy" that is consistent with reality, then China can assist Japan with a truly 'live and die together' spirit.

<h3 id="e2">Japanese General Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Battle Situation on New Britain Island: 58 Enemy Aircraft Attacking Rabaul Destroyed <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4 PM on the 25th: The Imperial Navy Air Force bombed enemy strongholds at Cape Gloucester and Pilelo Island on New Britain Island before dawn on December 24th, causing one major explosion and four major fires. On the morning of December 24th, the Imperial Navy Air Force intercepted 135 enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul, shooting down 58 of them, including 5 unconfirmed. 6 of our aircraft did not return to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - After the American forces landed at Cape Gloucester, southwest of New Britain Island, they have been trying to establish a strong bridgehead in that area to maintain their supply operations. At the same time, they have intensified air raids on Rabaul. From the 15th to the 23rd, they sent more than 210 aircraft to attack, but they were intercepted by the Japanese army, which shot down 51 of them. In total, from the 15th to the 23rd, there were more than 210 enemy aircraft attacks, an average of more than 20 aircraft per day. In the past, the enemy air force used to attack with 100 aircraft, but recently, since the enemy has built bases near the main battle lines of the Japanese army in the south, the number of enemy aircraft attacks has visibly decreased. What is particularly noteworthy is the complexity of the types of enemy aircraft. For example, most of the enemy aircraft that attacked on the 23rd were carrier-based aircraft. This is also due to the development of the strategic deployment of enemy bases close to the military strongholds of the Japanese army, but the fundamental reason is that the enemy aircraft carrier fleet suffered military setbacks in the sea and air battles in the Solomon Sea area and the central Pacific Ocean area. Since then, they have tried their best to avoid sending aircraft carriers out to attack. Currently, the enemy forces are using Goodenough, the Trobriand Islands, and Woodlark Island as the center at the eastern end of New Guinea and launching attacks on New Britain from Bougainville Island and Torokina. However, that area is under the control of the Japanese air force, and enemy attacks only increase their consumption.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - Former Japanese Prime Minister Prince Fumimaro Konoe recently published an article in the December 20th issue of the East Asia Common Culture Association's organ newspaper (China Monthly) entitled "On the Greater East Asia Declaration," elaborating on his views, saying that we should strive to understand the essence of the Greater East Asia Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance, and at the same time hope to launch a major movement to make this spirit of Asia permeate the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia. Now, in order to promote mutual understanding between China and Japan and realize the great enterprise of permeating the spirit of Asia throughout East Asia, Prince Konoe has decided to establish the "Sino-Japanese Association" and dedicate himself to the new movement. It is heard that the association will be established in late January next year, with the aim of realizing the Greater East Asia Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance in spirit and sharing the mission of Asia. Therefore, the governments of China and Japan have decided to actively support it. The Chinese side will also participate in the association at that time. It is heard that the post of President will be held by Prince Konoe, and Generals Nobuyuki Abe and Sadao Araki, Ryutaro Azai and other famous figures from the government and the public will be recruited to participate, so its lineup is extremely strong. The association is a corporate organization. In addition to receiving support from the governments of China and Japan, it will also receive donations of approximately 10 million yuan from Chinese and Japanese patriots. It has now been decided to use a certain person's mansion in Tokyo and the Meguro Gajoen as the headquarters and guesthouse of the Sino-Japanese Association to carry out activities.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Since the publication of the outline of wartime cultural propaganda policy, the issue of wartime cultural construction in our country has gradually attracted attention from all parties. It is now learned that relevant people in the literary field are rapidly preparing to organize a literary writers association (provisional name). The Third Greater East Asia Literary Conference has been scheduled to be held in our country next year, so literary writers from all parts of China, both north and south, intend to organize a group and establish a national association. In Beiping, Shen Qiwu of the Peking University Department of Literature, Liu Longguang of the North China Writers Association, etc., have had discussions. Jiang Yifang of the Xinmin Bookstore also participated and decided to abolish the existing organization and prepare to be a branch of the future writers association. The above three people have been recommended as drafting committee members to start drafting the association's draft. In Shanghai, a meeting was held in the middle of this month by Zhou Huarren, Ju Yueran, Tao Jingsun, Lu Feng, Qiu Shimu, and Liu Yusheng to discuss the matter. Masao Kume, Director of the Secretariat of the Japan Literary Patriotic Association, and Chiji Abe and Shimpei Kusano also attended. As a result of the consultation, it was decided to write to various parties within the year to initiate and convene a meeting in Nanjing to review the association's draft proposed by the North China side, and after deciding on the regulations, a general assembly will be held next year. The Propaganda Department of the National Government believes that this matter will greatly assist in the promotion of the outline of wartime cultural propaganda policy, so it has decided to provide maximum assistance. It is also heard that after the association is established, branches will be established in major cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Hankou, and Guangzhou. It has not yet been decided whether the secretariat will be located in Nanjing or Shanghai. However, committee members will be elected by each branch to form a committee. The matters decided by this committee will be handed over to the secretariat for processing.</p>
<p>Shimpei Kusano's Remarks</p>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Third Greater East Asia Literary Conference has been decided to be held in our country next year, and literary writers from all parts of our country, both north and south, intend to organize literary groups and establish national associations. In order to understand the work situation of the Japan Literary Patriotic Association and its opinions on our country's organization of literary groups, the reporter interviewed Allied Japanese poet Shimpei Kusano, who gave a speech, the gist of which was: "At the time of the Sino-Japanese Incident, although there were many literary groups in Japan, there was no organization that unified the literary national body at that time. It was not until the Greater East Asia War broke out that the various literary groups were dissolved and the 'Japan Literary Patriotic Association' was reorganized, with approximately 5,000 members. Although the association is a civilian organization, the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the Military Press Department, and the Greater East Asia Ministry and other government agencies are all supporting the association. Therefore, the association has made great contributions to the Greater East Asia War with the assistance of various agencies. Looking back at Chinese literature, although it was very active before the incident, there was no center, and its promotion of national self-awareness was only an anti-Japanese idea. At this time when the ideal of Greater East Asia is being built, it is necessary for Chinese literary groups to unite and organize a unified literary national body and actively promote it. Moreover, China and Japan are the center of the construction of the new culture of Greater East Asia, which is what we deeply hope for. After the Chinese Writers Association is established, it should have close contact with the Japan Literary Patriotic Association. Therefore, we have great hopes and expectations for the development of the new culture of Greater East Asia. We believe that the beginning of this new literary concept should start with China and Japan, and the activities of the new world literature should be guided by China and Japan." The reporter asked again about his feelings about the new literature of China and Japan. He said that China has no real new literary ideas. Before the incident, there were chaotic ideas such as Proletarian literature and Marxist communism. After the incident, there was a lack of firm peace ideas. It was not until after the three stages of participating in the Greater East Asia War and receiving the concessions that they had a deep understanding of peace and promoted the idea of new literature. China and Japan have followed the same path of new literary ideas in the past. After close contact in the future, the future of East Asian new literature has great hope.</p>

<p>Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese side abolished military administration in the Shan State, it was officially placed under the rule of Burma. The opening ceremony of the state office was grandly held in Taunggyi yesterday. The first Governor U Ba Yin and local natives all attended. From now on, the administration of the area will be under the jurisdiction of the Burmese government. The Bhamo representative also clarified the fundamental policies of the Burmese government on the civil affairs of the area as follows: The complete integration of Burma with the Shan State and Karenni. In order to achieve this goal, the cooperation of the two regions is required, so that mutual understanding between the residents of the two regions can be promoted, and efforts for the war can be boosted.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency) - In view of the fact that Burmese administration will soon be implemented in the Shan State, the Burmese national representative issued a letter to the local chiefs and residents on the 24th, the gist of which is as follows: The people of the Shan State and the Karenni region are originally related to the Burmese people by blood and are brothers. They were separated by the evil hands of the British. But today they have reunited again. From the perspective of history, it is clear that Burma and the Shan State and Karenni region belong to the same government under the same land and name. The former Burmese dynasty included the Shan State and other places. Now that Burma has gained glorious independence, we can reunite again. We hope that we will continue to do our best to develop. In order to adapt to this new era, we must unite to go forward. After we are united, on the one hand, we will jointly gain the honor of independence, and at the same time, we must strive to prove that we have fulfilled our due obligations. From now on, the people of the Shan State and Karenni are completely Burmese citizens. I, in the capacity of a Burmese national representative, based on justice, respectfully tell everyone that in the future, we will treat the people of the two regions fairly and equally.</p>

<p>Hong Kong, 25th (Central News Agency) - Today is the second anniversary of the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. Since Lieutenant General Rensuke Isogai took office as the first Governor of Hong Kong in February last year, he has been actively reorganizing the colony, sparing no effort, and it has been two years now. Since Hong Kong is not a material production area, the work of evacuating the population was first implemented. The pre-war population of 1.7 million has now been reduced to 800,000. The restoration of various industries has also been extremely rapid. This is the foundation for stabilizing people's livelihoods. More than 600 light industry companies have opened in Hong Kong, and general stores have also restored their pre-war prosperity. In addition, mechanical sailing ship shipyards are actively carrying out shipbuilding work, which has made a great contribution to maritime transportation.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Eve of Christmas, Fierce Fighting Still on the Eastern Front, Soviet Forces Increase Pressure South of Nevel <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports, military news: In the Vitesk war zone on the Eastern Front, German troops engaged in fierce offensive and defensive battles against the invading and powerful enemy forces throughout Christmas Eve. No less than 44 enemy tanks were destroyed. Soviet troops southeast of Kholoston also launched a fierce offensive yesterday, but were repelled by German troops. German troops northwest of Richtse once again drove back several troops eastward, thus occupying several positions and gaining important expansion. There was fierce fighting northeast of Shropping. The Soviet offensive southwest of Nevel was repelled. There were no major battles on the north and south routes.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - Maritime News Agency reports: The battle south of Nevel is the second phase of the war in December. Soviet troops attacked in three routes. Those from the east had at least six infantry divisions and three tank brigades, those from the north had three infantry divisions and tanks, and those from the west had at least five infantry divisions, also carrying a large number of tanks. The battle was carried out in dense forests and swamps, and the difficulty is imaginable. When the German troops abandoned the second line of defense, the artillery had to be reorganized, and the Soviet troops planned to join the two armies advancing northwest to cut off the German troops, and the situation became increasingly critical. The Soviet troops' plan was to cut off the road line, where the backbone of the German defense line was located. Fortunately, the superior strategy of the German command established an isolation line, allowing the isolated German troops to reunite with the main force, and the strength was preserved.</p>

<p>Rome, 25th (Central News Agency) - Pope Pius XII of Rome broadcast to Catholics around the world on Christmas Eve, saying that the Church has made great efforts to alleviate human suffering. The war is now becoming more and more fierce, and I think many Catholics around the world must be repenting day and night. But no matter how hard the Church tries, it cannot stop this war. I hope that this year's Christmas can be the last Christmas in the war. The new peace is not dominated by the spirit of happiness, but must follow the laws of religion and thoroughly base itself on the spirit of social unity.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - What kind of retaliatory measures the German army will take against the inhuman and indiscriminate bombing of the anti-Axis forces is attracting the most attention from various countries. The anti-Axis side is also particularly afraid of whether surprising new weapons will appear in the German army. It is said that German rockets were fired on the 23rd from the German artillery positions along the Dover Strait. Berlin news, German rocket teams engaged in artillery battles with the British long-range artillery on the night of the 23rd from Dover Strait.</p>

<p>Berlin, December 25th (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, in his capacity as the Nazi Party's Berlin regional leader, delivered a Christmas message to the citizens at 9:00 PM on the 24th, stating: For weeks, the anti-Axis forces have repeatedly claimed to have inflicted significant blows on Berlin, but a look at the damage caused by the bombing reveals that their target is not to destroy Germany's military-industrial complex, but to disrupt the morale of the German people. They failed in cities like Hamburg, Essen, and Cologne, and thus shifted their target to Berlin, attempting to shake the morale of Berlin citizens. However, the British and American press have already acknowledged that the German people have not lost their will to fight due to the bombing, and their morale has only grown stronger. Therefore, I dare say that even if the anti-Axis forces intensify their threatening bombings of the German people, the citizens of Berlin will continue to prevail. On this joyous Christmas season, I offer these words as a tribute to the courageous citizens.</p>

<p>Southern Italian Front, December 25th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report, the anti-Axis forces have recently been sending paratroopers behind German lines on the Adriatic coast at night, and also using submarines to land troops at night. Their motive is to seek out and rescue British and American prisoners of war who were captured after September 9th and then escaped. The Germans call these paratroopers or soldiers "dangerous teams." They carry large amounts of Italian currency, up to 100,000 lire, as well as the latest telephones and wireless telegraphs.</p>

<p>Lisbon, December 25th (Central News Agency) - The anti-Axis forces previously claimed that they would attack Rome before Christmas, but to this day, the anti-Axis forces are still lingering on a line 60 to 100 miles from Rome, making no progress. A special correspondent from the American International Broadcasting Association broadcast on the 24th that the anti-Axis forces still face unlimited difficulties in their war prospects since the Battle of Naples. It is said that there are still many German positions blocking the advance to Rome, and even if Cassino is captured, it does not open a direct road to Rome, because the road from Cassino to Rome is narrow, and the German army is constantly improving its positions. Therefore, if the anti-Axis forces want to attack Rome, the British and American armies must make greater sacrifices.</p>
<h3 id="e25">The Two-Year Development of Manchukuo <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Amidst the glorious and brilliant war results, Japan is strategically establishing an absolutely invincible, ever-victorious position. To echo this, Manchukuo safeguards the tranquility of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, striving to establish a self-sufficient food supply system between Japan and Manchuria under the supreme command of enhancing war capabilities. At the end of October, Director-General Takebe visited Japan and discussed matters, resulting in the formation of an emergency farmland creation project under close cooperation between Japan and Manchuria. The completed projects independently undertaken by Manchukuo before this, as well as new projects jointly operated by Japan and Manchuria, are also being rapidly implemented. Therefore, in less than two or three years, the food self-sufficiency of Japan, Korea, Manchuria, and North China has been well-established.</p>
<p>That is to say, the first four-year plan for farmland creation in Manchuria has been underway since the year before last. Flood control development in Yinma River, Chalu Kou (Jilin Province), Heitai (Dong'an Province), Suihua (Bei'an Province), Dui Li (Sanjiang Province), Panshan, Xinlitun (Jinzhou Province), Binjiang, and other areas has achieved substantial results, and efforts are being made to promote future achievements within two years. On the other hand, the areas that are gradually being concretely implemented according to the newly established plan are the approximately 20-kilometer-long coastal area centered on Fuyu Street, Jilin Province, on the Second Songhua River, as well as the area near Didabangzi, Lishu County, Siping Province, and the already underway areas. Thus, the new development of cultivated land has been completely successful.</p>
<p>In the Second Songhua River area, half of the total area will be put into production according to plan in the year after next, and all of it will be put into production by 1946. This is where the currently enforced key projects are located. The Land Reclamation and Grain Bureau and the Manchukuo Land Development Company have already selected the locations for the main waterways and conducted other on-site surveys. Parallel to this, they are actively preparing to secure materials, construction, and motive power in preparation for starting construction next year.</p>
<p>The characteristic of this Second Songhua River shoreline rice paddy creation is that, due to the terrain, it is planned to use dedicated pumping irrigation. Therefore, the banks of the Second Songhua River in Fuyu Street are equipped with large pumping machines with a diameter of 0.0 meters, arranged like fortresses attacking the United States and Britain, which can truly be said to be a magnificent sight.</p>
<p>In addition, from Dongyuan River to Didabangzi, under the guidance of the Ministry of Communications and the Reclamation General Bureau, and according to the principle of water flow adjustment, water conservancy is controlled, so that the vast fertile fields in the middle reaches of the Dongliao River will no longer suffer from floods. The wetland area of Yarge on the lower riverbank will be improved and made into rice paddies. From the end of November this year, an additional budget of 860,000 yuan was added for this year's project. There have always been various difficulties in terms of materials and technology for these projects, but thanks to the mutual assistance between Japan and Manchuria this time, the pumping machines, electric motors, and other machinery that are key to solving the projects have been given priority allocation. Even technical assistance from Japanese land development organizations can be expected.</p>

<p>The Imperial Government's fundamental policy of cooperating with and assisting Manchukuo's emergency farmland creation plan was formally decided at the Cabinet meeting on the 22nd, as announced by the Information Bureau.</p>
<p>In addition, not only is it relying solely on Japan for important materials, but it is also planning to increase domestic production and divert idle materials. At the same time, the labor force needed here also reaped great achievements and won praise this summer. Centered on the Manchukuo Labor Service Corps, it forcibly mobilized local labor.</p>
<p>Along with the progress of this great project, the advance of land reclamation also begins to work without wasting time. It hopes to colonize Manchuria with the population of mainland Japan, use the Labor Service Corps, and actively cooperate with Korean immigrants or Manchurian farmers to connect with reclamation work and seek a vigorous increase in production. The Manchukuo government and the public are concentrating their efforts to increase food production and devote themselves to supplying Japan's war effort, for which I am deeply grateful. In terms of the current food supply and demand relationship, Manchukuo's mission as a food supply base is becoming increasingly important, and there are great expectations for the future leap in food production in Manchukuo. In order to actively adapt to this demand, the Manchukuo government should not only thoroughly strengthen the various policies it has been pursuing in the past, but also establish effective counter-measures for increasing production and epoch-making farmland creation plans. In order to complete the mutual cooperation between Japan and Manchuria, Director-General Takebe and others have recently visited the capital to request instructions, and the government immediately reviewed the situation based on the local conditions with the relevant authorities. Due to the consensus of opinion, it was finally seconded at the Cabinet meeting on the 22nd, and the basic policy for cooperating and assisting this plan was decided.</p>
<p>This emergency farmland creation plan will start next year and be completed in 1945. In just two short years, it will not only create new rice paddies in the Second Songhua River area and the Dongyuan River area, but also complete the implementation of the established creation plan areas. When that arrow of success is shot, its products can also be supplied to the Japanese nation, which will be of great help to the food needs of the Japanese people. However, in order to succeed, it is necessary to invest huge amounts of funds, cumulative labor force of tens of millions of people, and throw in a considerable amount of materials, machinery, and technology, just in terms of land creation. The Empire's attack on the government believes that the significance of this undertaking is great and the effect is powerful, so it is determined to actively participate and cooperate to complete the sufficiency of funds, materials, technology, and other aspects.</p>
<p>In order to carry out this matter, although it can be imagined that many difficulties will be encountered in the future, in order to accomplish this, it is necessary to strengthen the active cooperation between Japan and Manchuria, and to deeply hope for the understanding and cooperation of all parties concerned.</p>
<p>According to the implementation of this plan, the entire food needs problem of Japan and Manchuria can be solved satisfactorily, which is truly a fortunate event amidst misfortune in the decisive battle period. (Shi Yan returned from the Mainichi Shimbun on November 23, 1943)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Fifteen Factories Designated to Manufacture Household Coal Briquettes; Officially Rationed with Tickets Starting on the 4th of Next Month <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the rationing of coal briquettes, an essential fuel for residents of this city, the responsible authorities have been closely consulting and planning. It is now due to the urgent needs of the citizens, but various procedures have not been completed. Therefore, temporarily from tomorrow (December 27th) to January 3rd, residents can purchase one "jin" of coal briquettes from designated retailers with the No. 53 rice purchase certificate, priced at six "jiao" of Central Reserve Bank notes. This Shanghai News Agency reporter learned from the coal industry yesterday that the Economic Division of the First District Office convened a meeting with the responsible persons of various coal briquette factories the day before yesterday. According to the person in charge of the division, the current per capita rationing of coal briquettes is being carried out to meet the needs of the citizens.</p>
<p>Limited to 300 Tons Per Day</p>
<p>It is stipulated that within the First and Eighth Districts, with a population of 2.2 million, it is limited to 1,050 tons, averaging one "jin" per person, and 200 retailers have been designated to be responsible for issuing old coal briquettes, supplying 300 tons of coal briquettes to each distribution point (retailer) daily starting on the 26th. As for Zhabei, Hongkou, Nanshi, and other areas, it will be handled by the municipal government. It is stipulated that the total tonnage for this period is 500 tons, the amount that each person can purchase, and the date of sale will be announced by the municipal government. However, retailers who obtain the No. 53 rice purchase certificate, printed with the registered number of the certificate, must sell the stipulated amount of one "jin" of coal briquettes and must not deduct any amount.</p>
<p>Officially Starts on January 4th</p>
<p>As for the issuance next year, all purchases will be made with the official "Coal Briquette Purchase Certificate" from designated retailers. The amount that each person can purchase with the ticket has not been formally decided, and whether it will be three or four periods per month is also under study. The municipal authorities have designated fifteen large coal briquette factories such as Yi Taixing and Nanyang to be responsible for the manufacture of coal briquettes. Smaller factories will be merged into larger manufacturing plants for joint cooperation so that the production volume can be increased. However, the authorities will be responsible for allocating the raw materials needed by each factory to make the briquettes. The manufactured coal briquettes must contain 50% of legitimate raw material content.</p>
<p>North China Coal Briquettes Will Be Transported to Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Shanghai Coal Association, the authority responsible for allocating coal briquettes, has dispatched responsible personnel to negotiate procurement matters in order to increase the city's coal briquette reserves and resolve the fuel panic as soon as possible. An idea has already been conceived and a large amount has been collected, so it is hoped that the supply can be increased by one-third or more from this month. Therefore, the city's fuel supply is expected to improve starting next month.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Rationed Cigarettes; Purchase with Empty Packs; Implemented on January 5th <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Central China Tobacco Rationing Association, in order to eliminate the black market for cigarettes and prevent speculation, has implemented a new system of graded rationing of cigarettes based on empty packs. The method is as follows: The sale of rationed cigarettes will be changed from unboxed to based on empty packs. Regardless of soft or hard packs, the purchase is limited to one pack per day. The price of rationed cigarettes is divided into nine levels: 10 yuan for the first level, 8 yuan for the second level, 6 yuan for the third level, 5 yuan for the fourth level, 4 yuan for the fifth level, 3 yuan for the sixth level, 2.5 yuan for the seventh level, 2 yuan for the eighth level, and 1.5 yuan for the ninth level. Smokers can exchange empty packs of the same level for rationed cigarettes of the same level. If small retailers have sold out the specified quantity of the same level of cigarettes for the day, they can exchange for a higher level of rationed cigarettes, but they cannot purchase higher-level cigarettes across levels. There are no restrictions on exchanging empty packs for lower-level cigarettes. Small retailers sell rationed cigarettes in packs. Empty packs of 10 cigarettes can be exchanged for 10 cigarettes, and empty packs of 20 cigarettes can be exchanged for 20 cigarettes.</p>
<p>Empty Packs for the 22nd Period Are Exempted</p>
<p>Empty packs for the 22nd period of rationed cigarettes are exempted so that smokers can collect them in advance for the next exchange. From the 23rd period onwards, cigarettes will be purchased with empty packs. Empty packs before the 22nd period will still be handled according to the old method. Small retailers must not take advantage of the situation or deceive. Small retailers should hand over the empty packs, separated into soft and hard packs, to their respective wholesalers for delivery to the rationing office according to the quantity of rations. The handling fees that each wholesaler and retailer should receive will still be issued as before. This method will be implemented from January 5th of next year. For the 22nd period of cigarettes, the payment has already been made and the goods have been picked up from the designated rationing office for sale over ten days.</p>

<p>Central News Agency - The Shanghai Flour Distribution Office, in order to meet the needs of the people's food and prevent malpractices, has decided to improve the flour rationing system so that every citizen can receive the amount of flour they are entitled to. Therefore, after the reorganization and establishment of the office, it immediately secretly drafted implementation measures for household rationing and special rationing and began to actively carry them out. It is learned that in addition to allocating household flour in the First and Eighth Districts to the District Offices as scheduled and distributing household flour according to the original method, the office has consulted with the Municipal Food Bureau regarding the household flour in Nanshi, Hongkou, Zhabei, and the South District of Pudong. The rationing method has been improved, and all preparatory procedures have been completed. The household flour for the 23rd period in Nanshi, Hongkou, Zhabei, and the South District of Pudong will be rationed with tickets by the public rice shops in each district at the beginning of next month. The Distribution Office has issued a notice stipulating that all public rice shops must pay and collect the flour line orders from the factories for delivery starting on the 28th of this month.</p>

<p>Mr. Eiichi Iwai, Secretary of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, is taking on a new role and will soon leave Shanghai to assume his new position in Guangdong. Four organizations, including the Shanghai Business and Industrial Association, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, the Shanghai News Association, and the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m. in the meeting hall of the Asia Development Building's Business and Industrial Association to bid him farewell.</p>
<p>Chinese attendees included Wen Lanting, Li Sihao, Zhang Yipeng, Lin Kanghou, Pei Yunqing, Wu Hufan, Liu Haisu, Chen Shaojui, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Yuan Shu, Huang Jingzhai, Wang Changchun, Lin Jiong'an, Li Fang, Yan Jiabao, Hong Hanbin, Cheng Zhongquan, Zheng Hongyan, Xian Nanqun, Wang Haibo, Zhao Jinqing, Xu Changqing, Xu Jingfu, Yao Qingsan, Ren Yunpeng, Zhao Xuantang, Chen Bin, and others. Japanese attendees included President Takashima, Toyu Yoshida, Professor Kubota, Professor Suzu, Hado Hiroshi, Minoru Yatsuya, Toraji Kurimoto, and over a hundred others.</p>
<p>Mr. Iwai arrived at 5 p.m., shaking hands with each of the well-wishers before taking his seat for tea and refreshments.</p>
<p>First, Mr. Wen Lanting delivered a farewell speech:</p>
<p>"Today we are holding this tea party to bid farewell to Mr. Iwai as he takes up his new post in Guangdong. Although Mr. Iwai does not hold the highest rank in the Japanese Embassy, he has been studying at the Shanghai Tongwen College and serving at the Shanghai Consulate for many years. He is most familiar with the Chinese people's personality and general customs. Therefore, he has maintained very close friendships with people from all walks of life in China. As we part ways, we feel especially reluctant.</p>
<p>Mr. Iwai is meticulous in his official duties, but he also values friendship. He is very warm and affectionate towards his friends, but he never neglects his official duties. We are particularly reluctant to part with Mr. Iwai precisely because of these admirable qualities.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that interactions between Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians should not only focus on official matters but also consider friendship. However, focusing solely on friendship and neglecting official matters is also insufficient. We sincerely hope that Mr. Iwai, although leaving us, will return to Shanghai in the near future. At the same time, we hope that Mr. Iwai's attitude of balancing official duties and friendship will always be integrated into the interactions between Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians. We wish Mr. Iwai a safe journey and a bright future."</p>
<p>Next, Secretary Iwai delivered a thank-you speech:</p>
<p>He briefly stated that he was very grateful for the warm farewell given by everyone upon his appointment to Guangdong. He was even more grateful for Mr. Wen Lanting's farewell speech. He never imagined that everyone would give him such a warm send-off. He spent one-third of his life, from his passionate student days to the most valuable years of his youth, in Shanghai. Shanghai can be said to be the center of Sino-Japanese friendship, and it can also be said that effective Sino-Japanese friendship can be achieved in Shanghai. Therefore, he wanted to work hard and strive in Shanghai. He had a belief that Shanghai could achieve the true goal of Sino-Japanese friendship. Therefore, for more than ten years until now, he has been working diligently in Shanghai every day. However, due to his limited talent and knowledge, he has not been able to achieve perfect results. However, he has high hopes and continues to work hard to achieve true friendship. Shanghai can be said to be his second hometown, or even his first hometown. He believes that after serving in Shanghai, Shanghai is the most important place for both China and Japan in terms of politics, economy, and culture. Working hard here and extending it to the whole country can achieve the true and peaceful goals of Sino-Japanese friendship. He did not expect to be given a farewell party here today. However, after receiving his orders, he carefully considered that national affairs are of utmost importance. He sacrificed his beliefs and went to Guangdong. However, the authorities understand his feelings, so he will be able to return soon. Therefore, he is very grateful for everyone's farewell today. In the near future, he will impolitely ask for everyone's welcome. Finally, he hopes that everyone can work hard in Shanghai. Everyone knows that Shanghai is now in a very difficult situation. For example, the transportation of miscellaneous grains is very difficult. To solve this problem, the government should be responsible. However, everyone present is powerful and authoritative, not only for Shanghai but also for the whole country and even for Sino-Japanese relations. They can effectively solve this problem and take responsibility. If they can work hard, they will surely be able to achieve the goal of solving various difficulties. He will be leaving for Guangdong soon and has not had time to say goodbye to everyone individually. He is very sorry and thanks everyone here, etc.</p>
<p>Following him, Mr. Zhang Yipeng delivered a farewell speech:</p>
<p>He said: As Mr. Iwai is about to leave Shanghai, all of us friends feel a deep sense of reluctance from the bottom of our hearts. It is not only because we often meet and chat, and feel lost once separated, but also because Mr. Iwai's treatment of people is kind and approachable. He does not give us a sense of being a foreigner. Even among brothers of the same country, there is rarely such love and sincerity. Today's farewell party is really not enough to express even one ten-thousandth of our feelings. I want to express our passionate emotions, but I can't help but give an example. It would be more natural and interesting to analyze and elaborate on his four-character name. The first character is "Iwai" (岩). "Iwai" means mountain rock. Whether it is igneous rock or sedimentary rock, it is always solid, dignified, and upright. It will never change its silent and unmoving nature due to the influence of external objects. This represents Mr. Iwai's quiet side. The second character is "I" (井). "I" means a well, which is a source of water for everyone to draw from. It can give us the right amount of moisture, and it does not appear more when drawing water or less when not drawing water. This generosity just represents Mr. Iwai's active side. It truly symbolizes prosperity and rising upwards. Although Mr. Iwai is already middle-aged, he is full of vigor and vitality, no different from a young man. There is an old Chinese saying, "Heroes have a hard time passing the 'beauty pass.'" When Mr. Iwai encounters a beautiful woman, he is more devoted than anyone else. The third and fourth characters are "Eiichi" (英一). "Ei" is single-mindedness. Mr. Iwai's personality is that he means what he says. We have never heard him say anything frivolous. The so-called "uniform and unwavering" is Mr. Iwai's hallmark. Therefore, the four characters of "Iwai Eiichi" completely depict his full appearance, even more clearly than a photograph. We respect him, and that is because of these four characters.</p>
<p>Finally, Wen Lanting, on behalf of the Business and Industrial Association and the Citizens' Welfare Association, presented Mr. Iwai with a large silver cup engraved with the four characters "Peng Cheng Wan Li" (鹏程万里, meaning "Boundless Future") as a memento. Zhang Yipeng presented a personally inscribed scroll with a farewell poem: "风流上国宾，每邀促膝话和亲，居然倾盖成知已，颇觉停杯愧主人，东亚文明同信仰，大和武道见精神，岭南不似阳羡远，小别归来正早春" (A distinguished guest from a cultured nation, often invited to sit knee-to-knee to discuss peace, unexpectedly becoming a close friend at first meeting, making the host feel ashamed to stop drinking. East Asian civilization shares the same beliefs, the spirit of Yamato Bushido is evident. Lingnan is not as far as Yangxian, a brief farewell, returning in early spring). Mr. Iwai accepted each gift and expressed his gratitude. After a group photograph, the farewell tea party, filled with warm emotions, ended at 6:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Our newspaper's sixth student aid program has begun preparations, and the number of donors from all walks of life is increasing daily.

We also received 7,000 yuan from Mr. Fei Yabo, who donated his friends and relatives' congratulatory gifts for his eldest grandson's one-month celebration to help students. Benefiting students and blessing relatives and friends is a profound and thoughtful gesture, which is extremely admirable.</p>

<p>Central News Agency: Due to rising commodity prices, prisoner food rations are also facing serious difficulties. The regulations stipulate that each prisoner receives 1.3 yuan, but based on the actual cost of living, this is far from sufficient, which can directly and indirectly affect the health of the prisoners. The Detention Center of the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office plans to increase the food ration for each prisoner to 2.6 yuan. A request has been submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office for forwarding to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Translation and Commentary: Expectations for the Rice Control Association <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Given the importance of the food issue, perhaps our expectations for the Rice Control Association are too high. We believe that regarding rice, there is no other way than to rely on the sole rice control agency, the Rice Control Association. However, the Rice Control Association's performance in recent months cannot be said to be satisfactory.</p>
<p>According to the Rice Control Association, the total amount of rice purchased by the association in both A and B zones reached 1.4 million shi (石). There is no reason for the general public to feel uneasy about food rationing. What makes the general public so uneasy is the inability to eliminate rice smuggling and black markets. Recently, the soaring black market prices in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places are also a fact. The inability to eliminate smuggling may be due to the lax enforcement of administrative agencies, but the Rice Control Association also bears some responsibility. If the relationship with administrative agencies becomes closer, these problems will naturally be resolved.</p>
<p>The rampant smuggling of rice and the soaring black market prices in various cities make it very difficult to purchase rice in the future. This cannot be eliminated simply by suppression. To strengthen suppression, at least the rice ration in Shanghai must be increased to ensure sufficient food, and new rationing systems must be established in Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong, and other places. Rice storage must be registered, and national accumulations must be suppressed. However, allowing rice businesses to implement autonomous grain control carries the risk of allowing businesses to hoard grain in the name of control.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some speculators seem to exist among the purchasing merchants designated by the Rice Control Association, especially in Zone B. Some designated purchasing merchants will pay attention to profits beyond those stipulated by the Rice Control Association. Smuggling and black markets are mostly instigated by these people. Therefore, if the Rice Control Association wants to fulfill its original mission, it must rectify these elements.</p>
<p>The importance of the food issue is self-evident. However, the essence of the problem is not the lack of absolute food quantity, but the difficulty of purchasing and rationing. To reasonably solve the food problem, we believe that at least the above-mentioned measures should be taken. (Xiang: Translated and abridged from the Mainland News)</p>

<p>Rayon cotton and wool fabrics are currently unusually expensive and in short supply. The factory has limited stock, and there is no supply for those who seek it. Eighty to ninety percent of the new products contain rayon and silk. Therefore, those who have old-fashioned, non-rayon cotton and wool fabrics from thirty years ago are hoarding them and reluctant to quote prices. As for transactions, they have been reduced because the end of the year is approaching, and various stores are taking stock and settling accounts.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Weekly Commentary (Continued from Page 1) <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Foreigners often say that China is a country with backward rational life, and many Japanese also hold this view. If the term "rational life" is interpreted as scientific life or logical life, then this criticism may be correct to some extent. Chinese people cannot be said to have a logical rational life. However, on the other hand, people almost forget that Chinese people have been living an emotional life for the past five thousand years—in the words of Gu Hongming, a "Life of the Heart"—Chinese people are not a nation that thinks with their "heads" but a nation that contemplates with their "hearts." Therefore, even if the Chinese understand the reasons with their heads, if their hearts do not understand, it is still in vain. If Chinese people are treated like other semi-civilized races simply because they do not think with their heads, then it would be a big mistake. The Chinese people's five thousand years of "life of the heart," even if they cannot understand the logic of things, will give the Chinese the ability to distinguish the truth. "Distinguishing the truth" means distinguishing whether the name and reality are consistent. Chinese people do not believe in things before they feel them in practice. Japanese people who think with their heads and act logically believe that since Japan and China are allies, Japan treats China equally. Therefore, the Chinese people's feelings towards Japan should change rapidly according to this theory. However, Chinese people who think with their hearts and act according to "passion," if they do not have a feeling of equality with the Japanese that matches the name and reality, then they do not believe that China and Japan have truly formed an alliance. As the Japanese say, "总不落于肺腑 (There is always some suspicion—Translator)." In fact, this feeling is the psychological basis that makes them suspect that there is something shady behind the Sino-Japanese alliance.</p>
<p>If Japan focuses on the psychology of these Chinese intellectuals and can thoroughly grant them autonomy and equality that matches the name and reality, I dare to believe that not only Chongqing, but even the youth of the Chinese Communist Party, would happily embrace Japan and fight with full enthusiasm for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Chinese intellectuals do not oppose Japan's advocacy of "Asia for Asians." At the same time, they deeply feel that it is China's national duty to work hand in hand with Japan to jointly complete the sacred cause of liberating Asia. However, they believe that in order to realize "Asia for Asians," we must first realize "China for Chinese." At the same time, they believe that the process of "China's liberation" is the process of "Asia's liberation." Therefore, the more they feel that their motherland is a "China for Chinese" that is fully realized, the more enthusiastic they will be about the war for the liberation of Asia. Chinese intellectuals are by no means passive or disinterested in the Greater East Asia War. Although their passion for the liberation of Asia is burning fiercely in their hearts, this passion is now being suppressed because of their fear of Japan. A virgin who is deeply in love with a man always does not speak loudly or express herself much in front of that man, just as if she does not like this man. The reason is that she has not truly judged whether he loves her. Before judging, she tries not to reveal her passion. If he can resolve her doubts, then she will immediately jump into his arms. Japan is like this man. If it knows the passion burning in the hearts of the Chinese and can instantly resolve the doubts of the Chinese, then China will immediately jump into Japan's arms. However, in this case, even if Japan is like Don Juan, the number one love tactician, and says in an exaggerated manner, "I absolutely love you," as long as these words are not fully realized and do not match the name and reality, then Chinese intellectuals will give him the cold shoulder. If you want to persuade Chinese intellectuals with sweet words, Japan should not adopt "frivolous love methods" towards China. Respect the other party's personality, do not think of it as an object for venting sexual desire, intend to take the other party as a lifelong partner, and say it frankly. It is not intended to take a concubine, but to welcome her as the main wife. On this point, I think it is very appropriate to say that Chinese intellectuals are very much like experienced old maids. When they hear a man's sweet words, they first want to know how much truth there is in these words. The sweeter the words, the more they want to know what medicine is being sold in the gourd to avoid being deceived. To gain the trust of this old maid, it is not with words, but in daily life, even trivial matters must show sincerity and be moved with the man's true heart. If Japan wants to win over Chinese intellectuals, it must make them deeply feel Japan's sincerity in small issues in daily life, and further, make them fully, authentically, and realistically feel the Sino-Japanese alliance.</p>
<p>Confucius said: "Great fear of the people's will, this is called knowing the root, this is called knowing the ultimate." According to Gu Hongming's explanation, it means "Care like being afraid of the hearts of the people is the foundation of the education industry, and it is also the highest education." However, I think it might be better to interpret this sentence as "Fearing the hearts of the people, paying attention to the hearts of the people, is the foundation of cultural work and also the highest goal."

<p>Mr. Hu Duzhou, the principal of the private Fuguang Elementary School (located on Sanpailou Road), has been working hard in the education industry as a paralyzed person for twenty years, and his spirit is admirable. According to a letter yesterday, "Duzhou knows that his ability is weak and cannot handle the management of this school. But there is no one to take over, so he has to do it reluctantly. Fortunately, there are no major mistakes in teaching affairs, but the economic aspect is slightly lacking, and the facilities are not complete. Looking back on the past twenty years, those who have had contact with paralyzed people mostly plan for themselves and are nothing more than begging or emulating Wu Xun. Hard work and eating are beneficial to others, because hard work can dispel worries and time, and can also slightly make up for the shortcomings of others, avoiding being a (missing character) parasite burdening others. If the authorities can encourage (missing character) to do more for society, it would be of great benefit."</p>
