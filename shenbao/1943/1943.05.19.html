<p>社評</p>
<h3>再爲華北災荒呼籲</h3>
<p>今年華北各省的災荒之嚴重，爲歷史上所僅見，不僅河南，山東各省，到處流離着無衣無食的災民，各省當局及地方領袖，呼籲振濟，力竭聲嘶；就如一向被視爲華北政治文化中心的北京天津等地，近來也陷於極　飢饉。據本報五月三日北京通訊的報告：「華北最大都市平津兩市，發生空前的飢餓的恐怖，小康之家及中等以下的薪水階級，生活陷於恐慌。多數機關小職員，小學敎員，書間辦事敎書，夜間駕三輪人力車，兜攬乘客，以求補助。拖着乘客奔跑的黃包車夫。隨時有暈倒街頭一瞑不視的，原因是腹內空空，力盡氣絕。據調査三月份內，平津兩市，每日各有二三百人因飢餓而死」以如此大都市而有如此嚴重的飢荒現象，不能不喚起國人的注視。至於華北鄉間的飢荒，更爲慘痛，依據同一通訊所報吿的，「距離北京迤北三十里的湯山一帶，居民即以草根草耔樹皮爲糧。山西，河南·河北·有些地方連草根樹皮都吃光了。」我們安坐在上海，讀到這種字字是血是淚的報告，想到了每一個國民對於自己同胞的責任，眞有說不盡的痛苦和同情。</p>
<p>人類都是有感情有義氣的，當此另一地方發生如此災荒與禍患的時候，我們雖有珍饈美饌，恐怕也不免在杯碟之間，看到絕食而死的萬千北方同胞的影印吧！雖有音樂歌曲，恐怕也不免在其中聽出北方萬千同胞的哀號呼救之聲吧！爲此，我們不惜一再爲華北各省的災民請命，一方面呼籲各慈善團體，各界仕女，大家出錢，協助當局，募集捐款，購運食糧及藥品，急賑北方災民，另一方面更應該組織災區視察團，或上海各界義賑團，分別前往北方災區，實地視察和散放糧食，使能更切實地協助當局，救濟各地災民。</p>
<p>這次華北各省的大災，自然發端於天災，但是，如果人事能盡其力，則天災未嘗不可在短時期內求其縮小與消泯，否則災象就不免日形嚴重，馴至達到不可收拾的地步。這次北方災象已成之後，很顯然的，還包含着人事方面的不幸因素，如五月三日本報北京通訊所說的：「本年一月底以來，華北的生活程度，陡然高漲起來，特別是食糧，生活必需品，一倍一倍的增加上去。」這裏就有着人爲的禍根，致使災象更趨嚴重。所謂人爲的禍根，雖然不止於一端，但如同一通訊中所舉出的是；一有產階級，拚命囤購食糧。食糧的價格，也隨着競買的風氣而與日俱增，甚至上下午的售價，都有極高的差額。」經過當局雷厲風行的措施之後，我們相信華北飢荒中的人爲的因素，目前已經逐漸消除了，但是，問題的根本解決，究竟有待於物資來源的充裕，國民一般購買力的提高，否則，一方投機圃積之風無法澈底消泯，另一方面，最大多數的中下層人民，仍不免有流離偕亡的危險。所以，我們除了呼籲當局與各地同胞協力舉辦急賑之外，更期待中央和華北地方當局一致協力，改善農田水利，改善佃租關係，貸放資本種籽，農具肥料，擴大農業生產等等，我們認爲這是應該和急賑同樣重要的，而且是治本的辦法。</p>
<p>我們昨天接到讀者對於賑災的意見很多，都是出於同情心的建議，特別是一讀者的兩個先決問題，頗具見地，（原文登載今日本報第四版國民論壇）我們也有同感。第一，盼望中央主管機關與友邦當局折衝，特別允許賑物的流通。第二，遴選廉明公正的放賑人員，與災區地方當局及地方士紳，協同辦理。此外，「救災如救火」，一切處理手續，以愈簡單愈迅捷爲原則，千萬不要像辦公事的牛步迂迥。這裏，我們假定自發動籌募以至實地發放，以一個月爲期，換句話說，至六月中旬，應有大批的賑物賑款到達災區，以後陸續發放。我們相信籌集賑款，本於各界人士的惻隱和同情之心，成績定必不惡，而如何切實迅速發放，確是緊接着的重要問題。應由中央主管機關綜持其事，並請由當局通令各有關部會，各省市政府，轉飭主管糧食，交通，運輸，經濟，社會福利各級機關，動員全體關係人員，充分協助賑災工作之迅速進行。我們可於辦理這一救急工作的迅捷程度　成效如何，從而測驗民心向力與行政效率如何。</p>

<p>雙方致詞</p>
<p>交還法租界實施細目簽字時，法國代表團代表駐華大使館參事柏斯頌致詞如下：諸位閣下諸位先生，本日所簽訂之協定，係根據一九四三年二月二十三日法國政府之聲明，實施交還法國在天津漢口沙面各專管租界。法國雖然處於現在困難環境之下，聲明之後，爲時不及三月已自動證實迅速解決，與此項重要聲明有關之一切難決問題。法國代表團之任務，在談判過程中，承中國當局以友誼之諒解及協和之願望，得以完成其使命，本人對此深表謝忱。天津沙面兩地法租界成立迄今，已逾八十年，漢口法租界亦將近五十年，在此悠久期間，中法國當局，曾盡其所能管理上述各地，而促其成爲中法兩國經濟商業文化接觸之中心此項制度，現已終止存在，本日法國政府乃自動放棄。此項構成租界要素之行政權。在租界接收後，中國市政當局，將獲得一種組織及物質設備，而促使其能圓滑推行上述各地之行政，蓋此乃爲各地繁榮之要素也。此項友誼措置，一經完成，法國當局確信在華中法兩國人民間，地方關係之發展，決無隔膜疑慮及不良印象，而在合作上當日趨親密。本人深信此項協定影響所及，將使中國人民異常滿意，壯殆無疑義者。本人深願今日所簽訂之協定，非使兩國關係趨於疎遠，反可增進而加强之，且對於中法兩國傳統上相互間深厚之感情，給予一種新推進力焉。交還法租界實施細目簽字時，外交部褚部長答詞；柏參事及諸位先生，今日舉行中法兩國簽訂法國交還在華天津漢口沙面三租界協定之儀式，本人得能任爲主席，深覺榮幸與欣慰。法國政府現雖多難之秋，仍能毅然自動排除種種之有關困難問題，實踐本年二月二十三日交還在華租界之聲明，本國政府，對於法國政府此種友誼之措置，深表謝忱。自友邦日本首於本年五月三十日交還在華專管租界後，法國政府當仁不讓，亦特派代表團來京，與我國民政府進行談判，彼此協商之時，法方代表以友誼之諒解與協和之願望，致使我方代表使命，得以順利完成，本人敬代表政府重伸謝意。國民政府對於法國或中法文化與純粹慈善事業　仍願繼續予以維持，即足證明我國對於中法文化之溝通與發展，寄予深切之注意與同情。本人深信今日協定之簽訂當使雙方固有之友誼日趨親密也。</p>
<p>褚外長談話</p>
<p>外交部褚部長對於法國交還津漢粵三租界恊定簽字，發表談話如下：本年一月九日，友邦日本，與我簽訂交還租界，撤廢治外法權之協定後，法國政府亦繼日本而起，於本年二月二十三日，自動發表交還在華租界及撤廢治外法權之聲明。自該聲明發表以後，法國政府卽令該國駐華大使館，於本年三月二十九日與我國外交部交換放棄其北京使館區域內行政權之照會，本年四月八日復交換放棄其鼓浪嶼公共租界內行政權之照會。此後雙方復正式派定委員，協議交還天津，漢口，沙面各法國專管租界之實施協定。自上月中旬雙方委員開始折衝以來，往返多次，意見極爲接近，至本月中旬，已臻完全一致，遂於本月十八日將全部協定正式簽字。査法國政府發表交還租界及撤廢治外法權之聲明，距今不過二月有餘，而聲明內所指之北京使館區鼓浪嶼公共租界，以及天津漢口沙面各專管租界之行政權，均已先後簽訂文件正式交還，足見法國政府對於中國之同情，未嘗後人。根據今日簽訂之協定，所有天津漢口及沙面之法國專管租界，定於六月五日全部交還，此等租界散處於我國經濟及商務之重心，其地位極爲重要，設立以來，已有七十餘年，經法國官民之慘淡經營，精心擘劃，由荒僻地域變成現代式之繁華城市，界內各項設施，均甚完善，今法國政府値茲本國環境萬分困難之時，竟將其在遠東所享之多年權益，毅然放棄，更足顯示法國當局，具有遠大之政治眼光也。査外人在我國設置租界，已有百年之歷史，始作俑者，實爲英國，嗣後各國援例設立，以致我國重要各地，均有外國管理地區，爲我國法令之所不及，損害我國主權，莫此爲甚，外人所享之此項權益，皆自不平等條約而來，故國父遺敎，諄諄以最短期間廢除不平等條約相吿誡。今幸友邦日本首先倡議交還租界，法國繼起實踐，義大利亦將接踵響應，行見百年來畸形制度，不久即可掃除凈盡，有助於我國主權之恢復，實非淺鮮。至於前項天津漢口沙面租界，一經我國接收之後，管理經營，當力求完善，而對於租界內外之中法兩國人民，亦當力求其情感之融洽，與福祉之增進，使彼此合作，相互提携，共享安居樂業之幸福也。</p>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　交還在華專管租界法國方面代表，茲定於十九日中午宴請中國方面代表，下午四時褚外交部長，將於法比瑞同學會舉行茶會，招待法方代表。</p>

<h3>東綫泥濘期已過去　德準備夏季攻勢　克里姆斯加雅蘇軍三師被殲維里基魯基西德軍亦獲勝利</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　據德軍前綫消息，刻德軍除於東綫中部　里克爾基地區尙作局部攻勢外，橋頭堡及東綫全綫，殆無戰事。但蘇軍近兩日夾頻向庫班方面莫斯科南方及列寗格勒地區集結兵力，似在準備開始大攻勢。又德空軍之攻勢，愈形熾烈，因而衆認德軍展開夏季攻勢之期，益爲迫近。</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　海通社軍事特派員昨晚宣稱，德軍在庫班橋頭堡地區所作之局部攻擊，在週末時，已完滿結束。克里姆斯加雅西南前綫地區之蘇軍突入已被除去，該處在蘇軍上次大規模攻擊之後，已被遮斷，但仍使德軍大感小便，蘇軍在該處之森林，及櫵貫該地之深峽中，已獲得穩固之立足點，且又源源自後方增援，但結果　兩日之劇戰後，卒被克服，損失非常重大。德軍高級指揮部，於五月十六日所發之公報中謂，單在此處比較狹小之地區中，已有蘇軍步兵三師被消滅，德軍於星期日在維里基魯基之西，亦獲同樣勝利，將在冬季作戰時，即已有存在之蘇軍突出一處剷除，沿　綫之全部雙方，皆已大事加緊偵察及斥堠活動，蘇德兩方之空軍，亦極爲活躍，但若據此兩處推斷謂三月底以來之作戰沉寂，現時將吿終結，則屬過早。現時所得確言者，爲雙方皆極力探察對方之意向，在泥濘時期業已過去，地勢又可作大規模戰鬥之戰，此舉實屬當然。雙方皆已獲得行動之自由，雙方之總參謀部，皆須計及對方有首先打擊之可能，因此雙方之加緊偵察活動。或係防禦性質，雙方並或將繼續保持此種態度，以待對方首先打擊，誠如是，則現時雙方嚴加戒備，加緊偵察之狀態，或將延至許多星期，此種發展絕對可能，雖則早日停止沉寂之機會，比較峪大，現時妄事推測，殊屬危險，大規模之攻勢，究由何方首先發動，須留待將來分解。</p>
<h3>義國朝野咸抱決心　以應付未來事件　參議員薩拉泰發表演說謂軸心國團結愈見密切</h3>
<p>羅馬十八日中央社電　海通社特派員稱：義國人民對於突尼西亞事件，已完全消釋其憂傷，現時正以決心及懷疑之態度應付反軸心方面所誇示之地中海地區之軍事行動。大部份之民衆皆能明瞭兩事，其一即爲突尼西亞之被佔，並不決定地中海之問題，其二爲作戰已擴展至全世界，非洲戰塲不過其中之穿揷而已。上至政府官員下至販夫走卒，皆知不斷宣傳之反軸心將進攻義國本土及其屬島之說，乃專欲破壞義國民衆之神經而已、此間流行之見解以爲：英·美顯然幻想義人之精神已因北非事件而大爲頽喪，義國民衆及當局即大事準備，以防反軸心之大規模空襲，用以對抗此種心理上之　迫。最近數日來發出空襲警報時，民衆已較爲鎭靜，而更有紀律，民衆對於預期之敵方行動，並無驚惶之象。義人坦然宣　：英·美空軍現時之損失率甚高，故其使用非洲方面空軍能繼續至多久，尙須待將來方知。至於反軸心在義大利國土登陸，則根據北非戰事之經騐，民衆已深悉反軸心軍欲集中充份之部隊，以在一定地點作戰，必須有長久之時問，每一義人皆明白義國國內有種種優勢，並有完善之運輸系統，故皆以堅決衛國之決心，應付未來事件。</p>
<p>羅馬十八日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社訊：義參議員薩拉泰，昨在參院討論外部本屆財政年度預算案時發表演說，謂德·義兩國人民之團結，在過去一年中愈見密切，義相與德元首間日趨增加之友誼與信任，不僅爲一種象徵，且爲一種保證。並鼓勵義大利與另偉大同盟國日本之關係·羅馬·柏林與東京外交部中時常舉行之外交上接觸及技術委員會之權，已證實三國公約在戰時與和平時代及歐洲與大東亞間之功能氏繼述德·義兩領袖最近會晤後所發公報中之各基本要點，因目前戰事而引起之新感覺，已確認首要急務即爲歐洲之聯合，三世紀來一切聯合歐洲之企圖，均遭英國之反對，蓋恐聯合之歐洲將成爲其潛在之敵人，此歐洲與英國間之衝突，實爲一切危機及戰爭之根源。氏又在其演辭中檢討過去年中之義大利外交政策及其與歐洲各國之關係。</p>

<h3>白宮否認　羅邱中止會議</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　昨日華盛頓及美國大多數地方，盛傳羅斯福總統與英首相邱吉爾之討論，已吿中斷云云。白宮方面，特於昨晚發表否認之文吿，交美國各通訊社發表，據稱，羅總統繼續與英相會談。並未予以中止，而與其赴印特使費里浦斯舉行討論，外間謠傳殊不可信。費氏係在英相到達華盛頓之前返此，並立即向總統是報，印度對於英美兩政治家之討論，絕無參加云。</p>
<h3>戴維思　赴蘇延期</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據華盛頓消息，羅斯福總統赴蘇特使戴維思，因在德黑蘭有特別任務，已延長其在該處之逗留時間，渠將討論美國在伊朗增設航空根據地之可能，渠以後或將以同一之目的，訪問印度。華盛頓官方曾宣布，戴氏之展期赴蘇，並謂戴氏須在德黑蘭與蘇大使及美官員　行重要會議云。</p>
<h3>反軸心軍在突境　糧食供應困難</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據阿爾及爾消息：突尼西亞反軸心軍事當局及季勞政權，突然感覺糧食及供應之困難。反軸心總部宣稱：大量之軍糧供應，已使用於供給民衆及駐軍，現正急速自摩洛哥及阿爾及利亞趕運糧食，但該兩地之糧食市塲亦極感缺乏。阿　及利亞食油甚感缺乏，食油批發商欲自突尼西亞輸入食油，但據接獲通知謂，須首先供給反軸心軍隊之需要，又須以一定之數量輸至英美，故平民之供給，恐將極感失望云。</p>
<h3>日佔領孟多詳報　緬甸阿拉干綫英軍敗退印度軍自動投降者日增</h3>
<p>仰光十八日中央社電　緬甸方面日軍，向孟多開始猛攻後，徬徨該地附近之英印軍殘部，即聞風西遁。日軍先鋒部隊於十四日即兵不血刃，開入孟多城。按孟多位於印緬邊境，南部臨納夫河，爲敵軍企圖進攻緬甸之最後據點，且爲印緬交通綫南部之最大要衝，今該地陷落後，敵軍不得不完全放棄奪回緬甸之企圖，同時沿海岸通往印度之最短路綫門房，亦即被日軍所奪。</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日本大本營於十八日下午四時發表，（一）日本陸軍部隊於五月十四日十四時攻佔印緬邊境納夫河畔之敵軍據點孟多，刻正準備今後作戰中。（二）茲誌自去年十二月下旬以來，至五月十日間之阿拉干方面綜合戰果如次，（一）敵軍遺屍六四一四具，（僅係被日軍埋葬者）。（二）敵軍被俘五七四人，（內有英兵多人）。（三）敵機被擊落計三二七架，（其中有一一八架爲地上砲火所擊落者），被擊起火者有二二五架。（四）日軍奪獲各種大砲二〇七鬥。（五）奪獲重輕機關槍四五九挺。（六）奪獲步槍手槍四八九七枝。（七）奪獲戰車裝甲車八三輛。（八）奪獲卡車二五五輛。（九）擊沉並擊毀敵船三九艘，（內有一千噸級者十六艘），此外並奪獲其他彈藥食糧軍需器材無算。（二）是役日軍有七一四人，陣亡一三六四人，受傷　損失飛機四十八架云</p>
<h3>日以醫藥用品　定爲基本物資</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日政府以供應重要醫藥用品，及衛生材料之需給一事，在直接　保戰力及國民之保健衛生上　　爲重要，　決定將其作爲基本物資動員之附屬計劃，以謀確保需給。該項計劃，爲根據物資動員計劃已確保之原有材料，而決定之製品物資動員計劃。包括軍需民需及輸出等全部需要。按日本醫藥用品，向來因原料關係，多仰第三國供給，而在此大東亞戰爭下，需要量益形增大之時，今已能設定一利用大東亞原料之自主的物資動員計劃，尤其以黑油爲原料之藥品，已確保成功，故實有極大意義。</p>

<h3>日企劃院總裁闡述　本年度交易計劃</h3>

<h3>世界史上的一大悲劇（六）</h3>
<p>— 德富豬一郎</p>
<p>（六）殖民地的土崩瓦解</p>
<p>英國祇有離心力而沒有向心力。並不是完全沒有，乃是說向心力不敵其離心力。日本是內包的國家，英國是外延的國家。日本以皇室爲中心，皇　　如太陽系中的太陽，一切　　繞於皇室，以皇室爲中心　　轉英國則沒有所謂中心　　這說法我們並不是說英國人沒有國民性，母寗說因爲英國是島國，所以比歐洲其他國家發達得早。</p>
<p>可是那國民性却變成了所謂盎格魯撒克遜的優越感，散播於世界。這些散居於世界的所謂海賊們的子孫，對其祖國英國的忠誠思想，極爲稀薄。的在美國革命的二十五年前，法國的條果曾說：</p>
<p>「殖民地猶樹木的果實，成熟之後，即脫離其本幹而落下地上。美國無論在將來怎樣，終究也要變成與卡爾泰果同樣的。」</p>
<p>卡爾泰果者，曾爲非尼基亞的殖民地，後來却凌駕於非尼基亞之上的國家。從今日看來，條果對美國前途所作的預言，不能小說是正確的。</p>
<p>本來，美國的移民，即是爲了逃避英本國的政治上及宗敎上的不自由，而追求自由的境地。他們自始對祖國就不一定是忠誠的國民。</p>
<p>英國所憂慮者，就在於她在世界上的膨脹，以致拘束殖民地的箍漸漸地鬆弛起來。就是說她的組織網薄弱了，現出了尾大不掉的狀態。可稱爲大英帝國的首倡者雪萊曾說。。</p>
<p>「大英帝國的安全與恒久，爲人種的統一之主要力量。如澳洲，新西蘭，或加拿大即其例也。不過在印度，人種不同，宗敎不同，言語也不同，然而卒能征服印度者，不是英國人的力，而是印度人的兵力。英國人的兵力祇有五分之一，而印度人的兵力倒有五分之四。印度人也未嘗不熟知此事，這就是把印度維繫於英本國的難以忘却的因緣。』</p>
<p>這是信口開河的說法。印度人把這種英國人用權詐來征服印度的狡獪手段恨如切骨，仙們根本沒有想到因英國人的這毬手段覺到感激而心折。</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰，人們都見到了澳洲，南菲，印度向本國效其援助的事實，而以爲其組織是堅實的，不致有瓦崩等情事發生。但這畢竟不過是皮相之見。</p>
<p>他們所以援助英本國者，乃是爲了利己。不錯，印度在第一次世界大戰中，分擔了一億五千餘萬鎊的戰時公債，醵金一億鎊，出兵八十萬。印度爲何這樣起勁呢？就爲了相信印度人在戰後可獲得他們所希望的自由政體，自治制度。然而在戰後英國人似乎完全忘記了這件事，許以金而予以石，因此，現在印度的獨立運動，在我們眼前，如火如荼地爆發起來了。</p>
<p>即如加拿大，當時如萬一左袒德國，這在隣國合衆國當然是不能容忍的，爲了合衆國，加拿大如其不能用兵力來征服，也勢必用經濟力來壓迫，因此，寗願滿足英國的依賴，生產軍需品，並出動義勇軍。</p>
<p>澳洲亦然。澳洲之參加協約國，與英本國取一致態度者，亦是便宜之計。然而英國與澳洲的聯絡，靠了日本海軍的援助而始能保持，這是很明白的事實。假使澳洲萬一左袒同盟國，日本海軍立將封鎖澳洲罷了！</p>
<p>在南菲，當時掌握政權的蒲達及斯末資一派，爲了要壓制其反對者德意志黨，故與本國取一致態度。所以他們到了凡爾賽會議時，如加拿大的奧雨登，南菲的蒲達及斯末資，尤以澳洲的休斯等，在會議席上，傍若無人，滔滔而辯，把本國的代表勞合·喬治及倍爾福等不放在眼內。不管英本國依然把各外殖民地當作英國的領土看待，他們却自以爲獨立的國家，表示出了不自立不止的氣魄。於此，英本國與他們之間現出了很大的距離。當祝賀女皇五十年之際，從各殖民地來的首相開了一次會議。據當時的英國首相薩立斯倍利之言，當首相會議偶而談及大英帝國的編成時，頓陷於混沌狀態：「與其討論這種問題，不如討論大英帝國內共同防禦的實用問題。」本國政治家所熱中者，殖民地政治家除其本身的封土以外，對其他漠不關心。維多利亞女皇在位五十年祭的時候，正是英國最隆盛的時代，英本國的首相與殖民地各首相之間即已有這種同床異夢的狀態。况其後乎？</p>
<p>不僅如此，加拿大雖向來是農業國，然在第一次世界大戰後，爲本國製造軍需品的結果，變成半工業國，澳洲也稍有一點這種傾向，於是差不多與本國立於競爭的地位。而且自國際聯盟成立後，各殖民地各派遣其代表本國的委員，各行其是，英帝國政治家所企圖的把他們納入於大英帝國範圍丙，使他們的運動有節制，幾成爲不可能了。英國帝國主義政治家譬如母鷄，殖民地各首相獲其母鷄所孵的鶵鴨，不管其母鷄怎樣的在聲嘶力竭的悲鳴着，鶵鴨們各自顧自的飛入水上去了。於是在一九二六年，實現了英國政治家的預測，決定去除了構成英帝國的體制，大英帝國，以及大英帝國的領土，都變成了大英帝國內的自治團體，僅靠皇冠以維繫共同的忠誠，此外，內政，外交，一切都各各目主。</p>
<p>在其以前的一九二三年，加拿大與合衆國之間，締結漁業條約的時候，加拿大政府公然聲稱不贊成由英國的駐華盛頓大使簽署。這樣，除了對皇冠的忠誠以外，本國與屬領之間，並無何種關係，完全變成彼此毫無交涉的地步了。</p>
<p>於是依照一九三一年英帝國會議的决定，公布了所謂衛思敏司特法，英帝國愈加如前所述，把加拿大，澳洲，新西蘭，南菲，愛爾蘭，紐芬蘭六個國家，皆與本國立於平等的地位，至此，英帝國在事實上差不多已經完全土崩瓦解了。</p>
<p>所以在一九三二年的所謂渥太華會議中，英本國捨棄了從來的自由貿易，實施關稅政策，僅在英帝國以內行使自由貿易政策。這事實也祗在殖民地方面算是妥當，在英本國則無效果可言，何以言之，殖民地即使對本國免除了關稅的壁壘，在殖民地方面算是獲得了利益，而英本國却反爲此向從世界上失墜了她的地位。（翔：譯自五月五日東京每日新聞）</p>

<p>停頓將達四個月之南市全區垃圾，刻正由衛生局南市事務所，予以澈底淸除中。連日來僅中華路方面所堆積之垃圾，已出淸達三千車以上。市府爲確保南區市民之公共健康起見，特指撥鉅款七十萬元，以便迅速淸除。該事務所復令垃圾商人，限卅五日內，整個南市垃圾，均須全部清除。並訂有承攬合同，如逾限一日，則將處以罰金五千元。是以近數日來，南市街頭巷尾之垃圾，已在漸次减少中，想短期內當可如限濟除。</p>
<h3>自團換崗時　務須騐市民證　如因疏忽發生不幸交崗員應全責</h3>
<p>兩租界保甲當局，近査時有不良份子冒充自警團員接崗，騙取臂意等件，圖謀不軌，此種情形已屢見不鮮，影響社會治安至大。故日昨保甲當局，已通令値崗團員於換班時，務須向對方索閱接崗證件，騐明日期時間，以及崗位地點，同時尙須向接崗者索閱市民證，經査明與證件姓名符合後，始得將物件交付，如是方避免騙局。如有自警團員忽略親察接崗人證件，以致遇騙者，除依照遺失臂章罰則處置外，日後倘如發生不幸事件，該團員須負完全責任。又夏季已屆，自警團員値崗時，不准穿着木展或不整衣衫，否則以違反　崗規則論。故希兩租界自警團員密切注意。</p>

<h3>救濟華北災民的兩個先決問題</h3>
<p>— 一讀者</p>
<p>頃讀「爲華北災民請命」一文，不勝感動，按北方水道失治，每旱輒災，此係根本問題，目下姑且不論。今年災區旣廣，災情復重，待賑之急，自不待言。賑必需財，貴報屢次勸請出資，尤極扼要，惟以管窺所及，有救災前提中之綱領，必須先籌及與解決者兩點，如此兩點不能解決，雖集資萬萬，於救災仍屬無補，敢陳於下：</p>
<p>方今正屬夏令，災民衣住，皆非所急，則最急者仍爲食糧，該區民食，向爲雜糧，今旣失收，則恃以運濟者祇有滿洲國及晋北各屬，但當此軍事緊張之際，一切（尤其食糧）產·銷·運·皆歸統制，而滿·蒙·華北復分爲三個區域，且滿洲國及晋北各屬，產糧向有其指定之用途，今欲改運山東，河南以救災，勢非與友邦澈底協商通盤籌畫，結果皆成空話。而此協商籌畫期內，災民不能枵腹以待，勢必又死亡鉅額，慘何可言，如何方能出全力以與友邦急速商定辦法，此實爲中央地方各當局唯一之責，此其一。方今各地兵匪糅雜，交通工具復小敷用，糧食長程短程之運送，皆感不　，即査賑放賑人員之行動，亦成問題。以至於此類人員之選用，亦感困難。蓋査賑放賑之相當的道德技術，本爲起碼的要求，而在今日皆有景星慶雲之感，究如何方能應急，方能有實際，實爲極主要而須先決之事，亦即中央地方當局立須妥商即決之事，此其二。以上兩點，如不能解決，則所謂籌賑辦賑，皆爲空話。雖社會集款若干，政府撥款若干，統爲官樣文章，無裨於事，兩地千萬同胞，祗有束手待斃而已。鄙人明知上列情形，欲圖解決，本屬匪易，然舍此則根本無法可設，且舍政府外不能爲力，故本良心見地，凟陳如上，想友邦人士，當大東亞協力提携之際，對如此嚴重局面，必有無限同情，且饑饉洊臻，流亡載這，於各地治安發展，及應付東方全面之時局，皆有極密之關係，料必不至漠視。至中央地方各當局乃本有救濟之責，則更無待吾輩多言也。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>扶植正當企業團體</h3>
<p>我國產業落後，各種生產事業，極爲幼稚，復承戰事之後，雖以物資增値，一時似呈畸形蓬勃之氣象，惟多有外強中乾者，其事業之內容，尙有待於充實之必要。一二年來頗多新興之企業公司，其中以投資實業，扶助生產爲職志者，亦復大有人在；且其所建立之工廠均屬有關民生日用之必需，已爲社會人士所公認。政府對於企業公司，經營不芷當之業務者，實應注意矯正，而對於各種扶植生產之企業團體，爲發展中國實業，民族工業計，則當獎掖策勵。誠如四月二十九日「大陸新報」所言：『在推進新經濟政策的時期，原應獎勵設立足以促進復興工業生產金融商工機關，然而和工業生產不生關係的商業機關，以及僅爲表面上關係者，甚至爲毫無準備金的公司，……　爲堪以注目的問題』。</p>
<p>所以，我們認爲當局對於這一派的企業——和工業生產不生關係，甚至毫無準備金的，——實有積極指導的必要；舉凡營業之方針。經營之手續，以及加緊生產之步驟，推進物資交流之辦法，政府均應隨時指示途徑，匡正其闕失，增進其機能，俾所有企業團體，均惟政府之馬首是瞻，共同在統制經濟上效力，俾得完成全國經濟動員之任務，使政府與民問企業團體打成一片，使中國幼稚之實業狀態，藉以發榮滋長，共同追踪於先進國家之境，豈不懿歟盛哉。</p>
<h3>日商工會議所　積極改進組織機構　新設統制課負責調整日華經濟</h3>
<p>華中經濟，自有商統會之中心機構成立以來，統制機構，漸次就緒，處於指導上海日籍經濟界地位之上海日本商工會識所，上次設立經濟上海建設委員會，日商對策委員會，日華問題委艮會，網羅各界巨頭，從旁協力推進對華新政策，同時兼謀日商之福利，又爲適應新時代起見，決定擴充加强商工會議所本身之機構，曾指定武內常務理事負責起草，業已獲得成案，經十四日之大會通過，已於十五日起實施。</p>
<p>組織要點</p>
<p>將原有情報課改爲企劃課，除收集情報及報道事項外，舉凡經濟以及與關係官方，經濟團體之聯絡交涉對外事宜，統由企劃課辦理，故商工會議所之中心，置於企劃方面，調査課擴充範圍，包括資料室，調査空，統計關係，饗應企劃課之調查經濟動態，負責研究調査經濟之靜止狀態，並添設統制課，適應移轉統制經濟機構之華中經濟界，指導日籍經濟界，負有極重大之使命，專司統制公會及其他經濟團體，並掌理工商業之整理合併，事業狀况調查，以及華方經濟統制團體之事宜。關於新經濟政策推進後，日商之失業或受影響者，由該課與日商對策委員會等採取密切聯絡，負責統制指導。</p>
<p>經濟相談</p>
<p>商工相談所改稱爲經濟相談所，値此軍要階段，運用相談所之人事問題，該會亦頗重視，爲便利工作起見，現在之理事窒秘書處擴充爲專務理事室，庶務課，會計課，爲統一名稱起見，改稱總務課，經理課，出版課名稱未動，唯向以現地爲對象之出版方針，則加以調整，在融合中國經濟全體與日本內地經濟全體之方針下，改良出版事宜。組織方面，設事務局長，事務局次長，局長爲當然常務理事，次長爲當然會議所副理事，至於其他人事更迭，尙在愼重考慮進行中。又關於復興中國農村，亦已集合農村關係之富有經騐者，籌備設立農村對策委員會，關於今次改革機構，武內常務理事，特發表談話謂因對華政策之推進，日僑經濟界，不免有相當之影響，故與其力求减少影響，母寧以充實日僑經濟爲目標，使受其影響者無不快之感，就統一思想着手推動工作願從側面協力新政策之實施云。（五月十八日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>經濟局繼續指定　十六業公會召集人</h3>
<p>上海特別市經濟局，爲遵照戰時經濟政策綱領第五條甲項之規定，對於各種舊有經濟機構不適合戰時經濟體制者一律予以調整。特依據現行之工商同業公會暫行條例之規定，先將調整本市主要商品之同業公會，督促調整，本月一日起絡續指定主要商品同業公會發起人，已有十餘業正在積極籌備組織中。茲悉該局昨（十八）日繼續指定本市製革業等十六業同業公會發起人，限於本月底前組織完成是報備核。茲將各該業同業公會召集人彙誌如次（一）製革業杜華芳（二）皂燭廠業周邦俊（三）玻璃號業陳建廷（四）顏料號業李叔彥（五）化學工業原料號業謝筱初（六）橡膠品號業王靖東（七）烟廠業沈維挺（八）皮革號業徐文標（九）原皮業蕭勉哉（十）絲號業曹銘烈（十一）皮革製品號業王翊之（十二）絨綫號業沈萊舟（十三）毛紡織廠業程年彭（十四）原毛業華爾康（十五）化學工業梁紹坤（十六）呢絨號業葛傑臣。</p>
<h3>商統會　粉麥專委會成立</h3>
<p>粉麥專業委員會，在糧食部及商業統制總會監督下，業已組織成立，地址設於北京路二號蠶絲大樓三樓，開始辦公，並於明日（二十）下午四時半，假華懋飯店一樓舉行茶會，招待各界。</p>
<p>設立中日粉麥組織</p>
<p>又　記者獲悉，粉麥專鬥委員會之下部機構，經關係當局速日密切檢討後，業已確定在該委員會之機構者，同時包括中日雙方之粉食組織，華方即係粉麥業聯合會，日方即爲中支製粉業聯合會改組縮小而成，該會於本月中舉行之總會中，決定在其內部，分蒐買。加工。配給三部門。</p>
<p>華方配給單獨組織</p>
<p>致聯合會下之組織，即係粉麥業公會，該公會則包括中日粉麥業組成之，日方加入此工會者包括蒐買及加工配給三部，華方加入公會者則爲蒐買及加工兩部門，配給部門則單獨設置之。據記者獲悉，此項單獨組織，係屬臨時性質，至必要時將予改組之。</p>
<h3>銀錢會拆放辦法　以工廠商號爲限</h3>
<p>銀錢業兩聯合準備會庫，爲防止用以貨物爲擔保申請拆放通融資本，自極端愼重辦理同業拆放後，特規定各行莊提供財產申請拆借者，凡係立時可以變賣之貨物所有人，必須正當工廠或商號，所有目的非爲囤積圖利者爲限，並以總評價不超過對各該行莊核定拆放總額百分之二十五。其拆放總額不得超過各該行荘之實收資本及公積金之合計數。經評定價格後，其折扣（一）有限價者依限價六折。（二）無限價者依評價三折，拆放期間定爲十日，但得提前歸還，不得申請展期。同時盼望同業保持實力以策萬全，嗣後非遇必要最好不拆，拆放目的，純係因同業必要，遇其支付力不甚充分時，酌予供給籌碼，以爲輔助，並非對同業常川供給低利資金，以資平時之運用云。</p>
<h3>華股今日復業</h3>
<p>本市華股商號自向市經濟局申請登記，領取營業執照以來，已有股票公司新豐，寳豐，五福，等十五家，早經領得執服，並定於本月十九日正式復業。茲悉該十五家股票公司復業以後，規定營業時間，爲每日上午九時半至十二時，星期日及例假日休息，佣金收取，仍照向昔按成交額千分之五，同時，並遵照上海特別市附徵華商股票交易設明費暫行辦法之規定，按成交實際金額每千元，由賣方客戶繳納證明費國幣五角云。（不滿千元亦照千元計算），聞經濟局對第三批頒發股票商之執照，不日亦可發出。</p>
<h3>實部評定　春繭標準價格</h3>
<p>實業部鑒於江浙春繭業已上市，爲統一收購價格起見，特於本月十五日邀集江浙兩省建設廳及經濟部代表舉行春繭評價會議，當即公決春繭標準價格，通飭各絲廠商及餘繭商遵照辦理。本報記者昨再向　演局探得詳訊，（甲）改良種鮮繭價（一）三八〇斤繅折每擔司馬秤二八一六元，市秤二二八六元。（二）四〇〇斤繅折每擔司馬秤二六七五元，市秤二一七二元。（三）四二〇斤繅折每擔司馬秤二五四八元，市秤二〇六九元。（乙）土種鮮繭價依照改良種繅折價格以七折計算，並規定鮮繭三〇〇斤烘成乾繭一〇〇斤爲繅折標準。並聞浙江海寗嘉興等處春繭已上市，准許上海各絲廠商及餘繭商，依照部定標準價格自由收購。惟江蘇省各縣對收繭之廠商以本省設廠繅絲者爲限，上海租界區不在蘇省之列。所以上海各絲廠商已請求蘇建廳准予在蘇省各地自由收購云。</p>

<h3>華股復業的我見</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>華商股票交易，自從二月中旬因工部局主管部分認爲有投機嫌疑，而命令股票業商停止交易以來，已經三僩月了。其初，在報紙上，雖可以看到有關復業斷斷續續的消息，但忽緊忽弛，未成事實。最近才見各有關當局正式許可復業，以及股票業商聯合啟事的紀載。那末，今後華商股票交易，又將以新的姿態，重現於上海的經濟界了。</p>
<p>我自認是稍稍關心股票業務的一個，所以對於股票事業的動態，及其前途的開展，很自然地留意着。可是，我旣不是股票的發行者，或是持有者，也不是股票商的從業者；在我個人，根本對於股票的盛衰興亡，不發生直接利害關係。而我的關心和留意於股票事業的原因，倒是完全產生於「股票事業，對於中國經濟界的關係」一點上；也可以說，怎樣去靈活中國的經濟事業，尤其是工商經濟？是我所關心和留意的主要對象。因爲股票事業，是和工商經濟有着脣齒相聯的密切關係，所以也成爲我所關心和留意的附屬對象。這幾句話，雖是多餘的，可是，要說明我對於股票事業是客觀的看法，就不得不說。</p>
<p>華商股票，是代表華商工商事業資產的一種證券。所以，它的流動，就是工商事業資金的流動，足以靈活工商業資金的運用，而促進業務的繁榮，大概是不會有疑義的。同時，新興的工商事業，或是有計劃，有前途的工商事業，缺乏資金運用，那末，　了發行股票，以吸收資金，替擁有資金者謀正當出路，大概也是小會有疑義的。在這種情形之下產生　股票交易市塲，我敢說小但是絕對的需要，而是必要了。時下對於華股論爲正當投資，爲促進增加生產，爲繁榮經濟的理論文章，聽得多，看得多了，我不想贅述。我認　華股交易的本質，確實是當前繁榮工商事業所需要的媒介，主管當局實當於監督指導之中，加以積他的提倡，並且一方面從速建立正式市塲，一方面領導股票業商組織公會，以導引華股業商入於正當的軌道。要認淸所謂投機的流弊之產生，是由於不曾經過正當的督導方法，而任其自然的演變，縱使有其流弊的專實，但並不能只責備經營者，而忘却主管當局的放棄責任；這尤其是要反省的。「亡羊補牢，」尙未爲晚；很欣幸的，華股交易業已恢復，今後盼望主管經濟機關，必須認淸自身的責任，更須認淸華股事業與整個經濟界的關係，而從速籌劃上面所說的兩件事。那末，過去的覆轍，不　重蹈，而工商事業的繁榮，游資的出路，都得到光明的前途。謹於慶幸華股復業之餘。敢以貢諸有關的當局以及經濟界人士。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「言」與「行」</h3>
<p>— 芳草</p>
<p>「言」與「行」是表現人思想性格的兩種方法。「言」除了出諸口而形諸聲之外，更有用文字來表明。古代帝王往往以「腹誹」加到別人身上，造成多少「莫須有」的罪名，這是專制淫威下的產物，屬於一種例外。「行」包括兩方面，即積極的去做，和消極的不去做，前者是明顯的作爲，後者是默示的不作爲，其實都是「行」，不渦兩者表現的形式不同吧了！</p>
<p>聖人說：「觀其言而察其行」，一個人的「言」「行」不能一致，往往是由於他的思想的不穩定和難於捉摸。譬如在「言」的時候，他的思想是沈浸於某一種狀態，等到去要實「行」，思想就起了變化，偏向於另一種狀態，結果「言」「行」不符，竟會南轅北轍的毫小相干。</p>
<p>有人過份偏重「言」的一方而，而把「行」忘記得一乾二凈。他們的發揮議論，眞所謂滔滔不絕。還有那種氣呑山河的雄概，眞有點令人肅然起敬。可是等到考察過了他們的「行」，我們就會對於那些舉動表示驚奇和詫異，甚至於不敢相信他們會做出那些的行爲來。類此的例子很多，我們不難在四周我出來。</p>
<p>對於別人的「言」「行」，我們固須火燭小心加以提防，但最重要的還是我們自己的「言」「行」，是否能做到「言」必「行」隨的地步。假如我們祗顧在表面上說得美妙動聽，而實際上「言」不顧「行」，不肯切實的去履「行」自己的諾「言」老實的說，這種紙上談兵是毫無實效可言的。</p>
<p>大而言之，執政者對於政務的處理，固須要言不煩的去實幹，就是小至對於個人私務的措置，要達到不敗的地位，似乎也以能否身體力行爲其重要的關鍵。至於「言」的多寡，動聽與否，都是無關緊要的小事，可以不必過於計較而加以重視的。</p>
<h3>毅力</h3>
<p>— 振權</p>
<p>拿破崙曾經說過：「勝利是屬於有堅强毅力的人的。」經過一翻精細的考察結果，我們就知道毅力是依靠着三件事的之目的，意志和熱誠。目的可以集中我們的力量，意志能加强我們的信念，熱誠保持了我們的興趣摒除一切的障碍。</p>
<p>就某種意義而言，人生是戰鬥，一個專靠伶俐和巧遇而生存的人結果總是失敗的，毅力是堅實靈魂的原動力，掌握着知識賣庫之鑰的，從那裏，世界才會繁榮文明才得推進。</p>
<p>偉人是永不會去等候機會的，他們能創造機會，他們緊握現實，而立即加以解決，而畢竟克復了一切。在現世界中人類能做的最大的事便是去利用環境所賜給他的材料了，這是成功者的唯一途徑。</p>
<p>生命上最重要的一個敎訓，便是去硏究怎樣從失敗中獲得勝利，當我們受到了不幸的挫折後，能虛心地去找出所以受挫折的原因，這是需要極大的毅力的，同時，這也可說是成功和失敗的不同點，要知這一個不能奮鬥上進和不能忍受失敗的創傷者，是不會知道成功的眞諦的。</p>
<h3>勇</h3>
<p>— 宗魯</p>
<p>孟子曰：「夫撫劍疾視，曰：「彼惡敢當我哉！」此匹夫之勇，敵一人者也。」</p>
<p>東坡蘇氏曰：「匹夫見辱，拔劍而起，挺身而鬥，此不足爲勇也，天下有大勇者，卒然臨之而小驚，無故加之而小怒，此其所挾持者甚大，而其志甚遠也。」</p>
<p>橫渠張氏曰：「爲天地立心，爲生民立命，爲往聖繼絕學，爲萬世開太平，夫而後乃可謂大勇也。</p>
<h3>學習日語的目的和方法</h3>
<p>— 隆眞定</p>
<p>內山完造氏六七年前作過一篇文章，題曰：「一個人的習慣」，開頭便指出中國人與日本人之間，時常發生許多不幸事件，經思考研究之後，大部份由於互相習慣上的不同，及言語方面的不通。…在文末又作一結論說「總之，中日兩方面的人民，都應該互相了解各方面的習慣及言語，則小而可以豫防個人方面之誤會！大而可以解決國際方面的紛爭…」這的是平心之論，且確有先見之明的。</p>
<p>事變以來，日人研究我國國語的固然不少，而中國人研究日語的，則更多如過江之鯽，少數人的學習日語，誠如橋本關雪氏所云：『…日本語的盛行，…尤其在中國，文字的近似是便利的原因之一；（作者按：大概是指學習的便利）另一原因，可說是由於功利的思想，如其懂日文，可以快的獲得職業，……』（見五月七日本報自由談）但是依作者觀察：目前大多數的學習者，還是像內山完造所說的爲了懂點日語，可免除兩方面的誤會，因爲很痛心的，許多中國人尤其是旅客過去早已吃了不少不懂日語的苦楚，所以有很多很多的人認爲「懂得日本語方便些』才學日語。</p>
<p>其實，學習日本語的目的，不可太驕，亦不可太怯，不錯，學日語如習英語一樣，可以便利會話及做生意，可以看書報作翻譯；可說都是正當的目的，然假使有志藉日文爲工具，以此研究日本文學，攻讀社會科學，或以『溝通兩國文化』爲使命爲目的，那自然是更進一步了！</p>
<p>一般人的學習日語，都盼其「速成」，雖然中日文字有許多地方近似，令中國人學習日語較任何那一國人都便利，（反過來說日人學中文亦較便利；）然而每種言語都各有他的生命及特性，如果開始的時候即存有「此事非常容易』的親念，而不加以深切的關心，及細心的硏究，那麼，非但不能「速成」，並且會造成「畫虎不成反類犬』的笑話。</p>
<p>日太文中夾着許多的漢字，這一方面令國人學習　語感到非常的興趣，他方面却令國人不能深切的去了解日語，因爲有許多漢字，固然可以望文生義，與我國文字大同小異，可是亦有不少漢字讀者旣無異樣而且其意義簡直與中文風馬牛不相及。例如『油斷大敵』之義爲：「粗心有害，切忌懈怠』，『馬鹿』之義：爲「忘八蛋』；又如：『大丈夫』之義爲「堅固」，「勉强』之義爲「用功」…眞是不勝枚舉哩！</p>
<p>總之，凡事『欲速則不達』；學日語單懂得一點洋涇浜會話，或呆記幾十百條文法規則，是無濟於事的，惟有不性急不取巧！按步去學習，先從口語入手，再硏究「文語』，同時一方回設法練習「會話』，另方面更須注意「交法』，相互並進！才感到濃厚的興趣，及獲得深切的理解；這樣才眞能達到所謂速成的目的。否則，像普通那般人盲目的求速成，簡直是緣木求魚，僥倖的亦只能淺嘗到一點皮毛而已。</p>
<h3>天才與環境</h3>
<p>— 童乾</p>
<p>「天才」是什麽？「天才」是一個人生出之後就有的特別能力。經過了家長和敎師的領導，將其固有的天才誘發出來，於是就能够產生出一個有專門按術的人才。雖然每一個人有每個人的特殊天才，然而也有因爲沒有機遇而把自己的天才埋沒了的。這一點就是「天才」與「環境」之間含有的必然關係。這關係並不是「天才」能够改造「環境」，也不是「環境」能够產生「天才」；而是「環境」的適應和「天才」的發揮之間之密切關係。有了天才而失却了環境，就等於沒有天才；環境須要某種天才，然而却缺乏了這種人才，結果也等於了零，兩者俱失。例如淸代名人詹天佑，他的天才能力是發展中國的海軍，然而事實却相反，政府委任他去監造鐵路，結果雖然成績尙還不差，若順其道而行之，則其效果將要何等的大啊！再例如淸代的學者嚴復，有了高深的學識，有了精闢的思想，依照他的天才可以改造中國的政洽。實業等等；然而事實又相反，却將他埋沒在文學譯作的生涯中，只是譯了許多歐·美的名著，雖然這對於中國也有不少利益，但是與直接改造中國，其效果則有天壤之別了。同時，日本的伊藤博文却受到政府的信託，把整個的日本改造，所以現在才有如此的强盛，這因爲有了「天才」，並且又有了環境，兩者俱全，於是產生了偉大的人才。國家也受釗了極大的幫助。由此觀之，我們靑年一方面應當根據自己的能力和所趨向的途徑去培養天才，一方面也應當要設法將自己的天才擴充，成爲一個多方面的專鬥技術人才；在學校時，應當將所有的功課視爲並重，俟硏究至高深時，於其中選擇數種付以相當的代價和光陰去盡力學習硏究。如此，我能够大膽的說每個人的天才都能够適應於環境，並且很合於未來的需要。故每個在學的靑年對於自己的天才應當視爲人生最寳貴的東西中之一，並對準了環境的急需而儘量發揮它；，如此，旣不埋沒天才，又不逆了環境，於是可謂未來的有爲靑年了。</p>
<h3>小希望</h3>
<p>— 鳴</p>
<p>社會上的事，沒有一帆風順而得到成功的，在堅苦的奮鬥，不斷的磨折中才能獲得，而那時所獲得的成功，才是最美麗的，最寳貴的，偉大的人，這樣的昭示我們，他使我們知道事業成功的困難，同時也給我們以勇氣，叫我們去克服困難。</p>
<p>可是，在今日社會上的一般人，只要是閱歷多一點的人，他們總老是唉聲嘆氣的，對於他們事業的失敗，非但如此，他們對那些朝氣蓬勃的新靑年，也會放些「冷氣」，把靑年們熱的心，澆上一盆冷水，他們會這樣訓誡靑年……「我們靑年的時候，與你們一樣，還比你們强呢，但是現在怎麽樣呢！還不是一事無成，我勸你們，還是安分些吧！」這到像一篇山海經，其實就是殺人經。指示靑年們，事業成功的因難是對的，但是，唉聲嘆氣的，叫靑年們在因難的前面退縮却是錯誤的，罪惡的。希望這類靑年的指導者，不要再在唉聲嘆氣中殺害靑年吧！</p>

<h3>建造平民公共浴室</h3>
<p>— 葉伯初</p>
<p>不僅是在夏天，即使是在平常的時候，要是能够每天洗澡一次，不但使身心凉爽舒適，去除汚垢：就是對於健康，也非常有益的，這恰是很合衛生的保健工作。所以，在現在這炎熱多疫的夏天，洗澡，幾乎是大家每天必須實行的工作。說起洗澡，需要俱備地方器具和水三個條件，這在富室之家，原是非常便利，也許一天要洗上幾次；即使是中等家庭，也並小感到困難；然而，最苦的却是一班下層和勞力階級者，它們整天在赤日下，滿頭大汗地工作了一天，晚上，混身已潮膩得不堪；但是，十幾個人却登在鴿棚式的擱樓或灶披間裏，根本已是很狹擠，那裏會有種種洗澡的設備和地方呢！並且街　乞丐，遍體油垢，虱蚤亂飛，有的，甚至染有毒瘡，膿血淋漓，虫蠅聚集，眞是齷齪不堪，其狀實有難以形容之感！</p>
<p>所以，在這裏懇請賢明當局，設立平民公共浴室，使平民得有沐浴機會。這不妨借重保甲機構，揀擇適中地點，每區設立幾隻，裝置冷水蓮蓬頭，每次沐浴亦可約略取費，（其辦法儘可模仿公共厠所）。關於經費，或向民衆籌募，或由當局撥款，好在，時間短促，所費不鉅，而有益非淺，功德無量！同時，在防止時疫流行上，也不無利益的。</p>

<h3>Further Appeal Regarding the Disaster in North China</h3>
<p>The severity of the disaster in the provinces of North China this year is unprecedented in history. Not only are Henan and Shandong provinces filled with displaced people without clothing or food, but the authorities and local leaders in each province are desperately pleading for relief. Even Beijing and Tianjin, which have always been regarded as the political and cultural centers of North China, have recently fallen into extreme famine. According to a report in this newspaper's Beijing dispatch on May 3rd, "The largest cities in North China, Beijing and Tianjin, are experiencing unprecedented hunger and terror. Families with modest means and salaried workers of the middle and lower classes are living in panic. Many low-level staff in government agencies, elementary school teachers, and those working and teaching in bookstores are driving rickshaws at night to supplement their income. Rickshaw pullers, dragging passengers, are fainting on the streets at any time, never to wake up again, because they are empty-bellied and exhausted. According to a survey, in March, two or three hundred people died of starvation in each of the cities of Beijing and Tianjin every day." Such a serious famine phenomenon in such large cities cannot but arouse the attention of the Chinese people. As for the famine in the rural areas of North China, it is even more tragic. According to the same dispatch, "In the Tangshan area, thirty miles north of Beijing, residents are using grass roots, grass seeds, and tree bark as food. In some areas of Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei, even the grass roots and tree bark have been eaten." Sitting comfortably in Shanghai, reading these reports filled with blood and tears, and thinking about the responsibility of every citizen to their compatriots, we feel endless pain and sympathy.</p>
<p>Human beings all have feelings and a sense of justice. When such a disaster and suffering occur in another place, even if we have delicacies, we will probably see the shadows of thousands of northern compatriots dying of starvation between our cups and plates! Even if we have music and songs, we will probably hear the cries for help from thousands of northern compatriots in them! For this reason, we will not hesitate to repeatedly plead for the victims of the disaster in North China. On the one hand, we appeal to all charitable organizations and people from all walks of life to donate money, assist the authorities, raise donations, purchase and transport food and medicine to urgently relieve the victims in the north. On the other hand, we should also organize a disaster area inspection team, or a Shanghai charity relief team, to go to the disaster area in the north to conduct on-site inspections and distribute food, so as to more effectively assist the authorities in providing relief to the victims in various places.</p>
<p>This major disaster in the provinces of North China naturally originated from natural disasters, but if human efforts can be fully exerted, the natural disaster can be reduced and eliminated in a short period of time. Otherwise, the disaster will inevitably become more serious day by day, eventually reaching an irreversible stage. After this disaster in the north occurred, it is clear that it also contains unfortunate factors on the human side, such as what the Beijing dispatch of this newspaper on May 3rd said: "Since the end of January this year, the cost of living in North China has risen sharply, especially for food and essential goods, which have increased by one or two times." Here lies the root of man-made disasters, which makes the disaster even more serious. Although the so-called man-made causes are not limited to one aspect, one example cited in the same dispatch is: "The propertied class is desperately hoarding food. The price of food also increases day by day with the trend of bidding, and even the selling price in the morning and afternoon has a very high difference." After the authorities took drastic measures, we believe that the man-made factors in the famine in North China have gradually been eliminated. However, the fundamental solution to the problem ultimately depends on the abundance of material resources and the increase in the general purchasing power of the people. Otherwise, the trend of speculative hoarding cannot be completely eliminated, and on the other hand, the vast majority of people in the middle and lower classes will still inevitably face the danger of displacement and death. Therefore, in addition to calling on the authorities and compatriots from all over to cooperate in providing emergency relief, we also expect the central government and the North China local authorities to work together to improve farmland water conservancy, improve tenancy relations, provide loans for capital seeds, agricultural tools and fertilizers, and expand agricultural production. We believe that this is as important as emergency relief and is a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received many opinions from readers on disaster relief, all of which were suggestions based on compassion. In particular, one reader's two prerequisites were insightful (the original text was published in today's newspaper on page 4, National Forum). We also have the same feeling. First, we hope that the central competent authorities will negotiate with friendly countries and especially allow the circulation of relief goods. Second, select honest and impartial relief workers to cooperate with the local authorities and local gentry in the disaster area. In addition, "Relief is like fighting a fire." All handling procedures should be as simple and quick as possible. Do not be like the slow and tortuous steps of officialdom. Here, we assume that from the start of fundraising to the actual distribution, a period of one month is set. In other words, by mid-June, a large number of relief goods and funds should arrive in the disaster area, and then be distributed one after another. We believe that fundraising is based on the compassion and sympathy of people from all walks of life, and the results will certainly be good. How to effectively and quickly distribute the funds is indeed an important issue that follows. The central competent authorities should be responsible for this matter, and the authorities are requested to issue orders to the relevant ministries, committees, provincial and municipal governments to instruct the competent grain, transportation, transportation, economic, and social welfare agencies at all levels to mobilize all relevant personnel to fully assist in the rapid progress of disaster relief work. We can measure the public's support and administrative efficiency from the speed and effectiveness of handling this emergency relief work.</p>

<p>Speeches by Both Sides</p>
<p>At the signing of the Detailed Implementation Rules for the Return of the French Concessions, Counselor Ba Sisson of the Embassy in China, representative of the French delegation, delivered the following speech: Honorable Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, the agreement signed today is based on the statement of the French Government of February 23, 1943, to implement the return of the French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Shamian. Although France is in a difficult situation at present, less than three months after the statement, it has automatically confirmed the rapid resolution of all the difficult issues related to this important statement. The task of the French delegation was to complete its mission during the negotiation process, with the friendly understanding and desire for cooperation of the Chinese authorities, for which I express my deep gratitude. The French concessions in Tianjin and Shamian have been established for more than 80 years, and the French concession in Hankou is also nearly 50 years old. During this long period, the Chinese and French authorities have done their best to manage the above-mentioned places and promote them as the center of economic, commercial, and cultural contact between China and France. This system has now ceased to exist, and the French government is now automatically abandoning it. This administrative power constitutes an element of the concession. After the concession is taken over, the Chinese municipal authorities will obtain an organization and material equipment to promote the smooth implementation of the administration of the above-mentioned places, which is an element of the prosperity of each place. Once this friendly measure is completed, the French authorities are confident that the development of local relations between the Chinese and French people in China will be free of estrangement, suspicion, and bad impressions, and that cooperation will become closer day by day. I firmly believe that the impact of this agreement will greatly satisfy the Chinese people, and there is no doubt about it. I sincerely hope that the agreement signed today will not alienate the relations between the two countries, but will increase and strengthen them, and give a new impetus to the traditional deep feelings between China and France. At the signing of the Detailed Implementation Rules for the Return of the French Concessions, Foreign Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied: Counselor Ba and gentlemen, I am deeply honored and gratified to be able to preside over the ceremony for the signing of the agreement between China and France on the return of the three concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Shamian in China. Although the French government is in a difficult period, it is still able to resolutely eliminate all the relevant difficult issues and implement the statement of February 23 this year on the return of concessions in China. The government of our country expresses its deep gratitude to the French government for this friendly measure. Since our friendly country Japan first returned the exclusive concessions in China on May 30 this year, the French government has stepped forward without hesitation and sent a special delegation to Beijing to conduct negotiations with our National Government. When the representatives of the French side discussed with each other, the representatives of the French side made it possible for the representatives of our side to complete their mission smoothly with a friendly understanding and a desire for cooperation. I respectfully extend my gratitude on behalf of the government. The National Government is still willing to continue to maintain French or Sino-French cultural and purely charitable undertakings, which is sufficient to prove that our country attaches great importance to and sympathizes with the communication and development of Sino-French culture. I firmly believe that the signing of today's agreement will make the inherent friendship between the two sides closer day by day.</p>
<p>Remarks by Foreign Minister Chu</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the signing of the agreement between France and China on the return of the three concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangdong: On January 9 this year, after our friendly country Japan signed an agreement with us on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the French government also followed Japan and voluntarily issued a statement on February 23 this year on the return of concessions in China and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. Since the issuance of the statement, the French government has ordered the French Embassy in China to exchange notes with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on March 29 this year on the abandonment of the administrative rights in the Beijing Legation area, and exchanged notes on April 8 this year on the abandonment of the administrative rights in the Gulangyu Public Concession. After that, both parties formally appointed members to discuss the implementation agreement on the return of the French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Shamian. Since the members of both parties began to negotiate in the middle of last month, they have traveled back and forth many times, and their opinions have been very close. By the middle of this month, they have reached complete agreement, and the entire agreement was formally signed on the 18th of this month. It has only been more than two months since the French government issued the statement on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the administrative rights of the Beijing Legation area, the Gulangyu Public Concession, and the French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Shamian, which were referred to in the statement, have been formally returned after the documents were signed one after another, which shows that the French government's sympathy for China has never lagged behind. According to the agreement signed today, all the French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Shamian will be fully returned on June 5. These concessions are scattered in the economic and commercial centers of our country, and their status is extremely important. Since their establishment, they have been more than 70 years old. After the hard work and careful planning of French officials and people, they have been transformed from barren areas into modern prosperous cities. All the facilities in the concessions are very complete. Now, the French government, when its own environment is extremely difficult, has resolutely abandoned its long-term rights and interests in the Far East, which shows that the French authorities have a far-sighted political vision. It has been a hundred years since foreigners set up concessions in our country. The initiator was actually the United Kingdom, and later countries followed suit to set up concessions, so that there are foreign-managed areas in important places in our country, which are not subject to our country's laws, and harm our country's sovereignty more than anything else. These rights and interests enjoyed by foreigners all come from unequal treaties, so the Father of the Nation's last words repeatedly advised us to abolish unequal treaties in the shortest possible time. Fortunately, our friendly country Japan first proposed the return of concessions, and France followed suit. Italy will also respond one after another. It is expected that this deformed system for a hundred years will be completely eliminated soon, which will help restore our country's sovereignty and is not a trivial matter. As for the aforementioned concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Shamian, once our country takes over, we will strive to improve the management and operation, and we will also strive to reconcile the feelings and increase the well-being of the Chinese and French people inside and outside the concessions, so that they can cooperate with each other, support each other, and share the happiness of living and working in peace.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - The French representative for the return of the exclusive concessions in China is scheduled to host a banquet for the Chinese representatives at noon on the 19th. At 4:00 PM, Foreign Minister Chu will hold a tea party at the Franco-Belgian Alumni Association to entertain the French representatives.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - After the conclusion of the French concessions return agreement in China, Foreign Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a telegram to Mr. Gossamer, the French Ambassador to China, expressing his gratitude. The record of the telegram is as follows: "The agreement on the transfer of concessions between China and France has been signed by the representatives of both parties. On behalf of the National Government of the Republic of China, I hereby send you my sincere gratitude by telegram. Foreign Minister Chu Minyi."</p>

<h3>Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying Issue Statements</h3>
<p>Taiyuan, 18th (Central News Agency) - General Pang Bingxun, who joined the National Government camp, met with a group of reporters in a certain place at 4:00 PM on the 8th and made the following statement on the process and determination of joining the National Government camp this time: "I know that under the leadership of Chairman Wang, China has made rapid progress with the active cooperation of our friendly country Japan. The name of the Chongqing resistance has been lost. I really do not want to engage in blind resistance again and make the people suffer. After we joined the National Government camp, the blow to the Chongqing army was great. From then on, they will inevitably suffer greater injuries. I intend to give a sincere admonition to my former comrades in Chongqing, that is, in addition to resistance, we still have peace as a way to save the country."</p>
<p>Kaifeng, 18th (Central News Agency) - General Sun Dianying, commander of the newly compiled Fifth Army of Chongqing, has realized the sincerity of the Japanese army in assisting China's construction due to the spring Taihang operation launched by the Japanese army this time. He still resolutely gave up the past resistance and joined the camp of peace movement. One day, General Sun made a statement on the front line on the state of mind of joining the peace.</p>
<h3>Remarks by Director of Reporting Department, Tani Hagi</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Tani Hagi, Director of the Reporting Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, has had long interactions with Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying in North China and Mengjiang in the past. This time, Mr. Pang and others joined the peace camp. Mr. Tani Hagi issued a statement on the 17th, saying: "General Pang Bingxun's motivation for joining the peace camp is based on a certain belief. He knows that the policy advocated by Chairman Wang to promote peace, anti-communism, and national construction is the great way to revive China and defend East Asia. If we do not cooperate with Japan, there will be no peace and happiness in Greater East Asia. This point is especially worthy of our respect. I believe that after General Pang Bingxun joins the peace camp, there will be others who will follow."</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Held Routine Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Executive Yuan held its 162nd meeting on the 18th. The President reported that, according to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Social Welfare requested that 500,000 yuan of reserve banknotes from the disaster relief preparation fund be allocated to the Ministry of Food to purchase food and hand it over to the North China Emergency Relief Association for distribution.

<h3>Central Government Sends Officials North to Conduct On-the-Spot Inspection of Disaster Conditions in North China</h3>
<p>Beiping, 18th (Central News Agency) - As the spring and summer seasons intersect in North China, and food supplies dwindle, public anxieties about food have arisen. Chairman Wang of the National Government has received reports of the disasters from various sources and has ordered the Ministry of Social Welfare to send Councilor Kang Yuting north to inspect the disaster situation in order to coordinate relief efforts. Kang arrived in Beiping a few days ago and issued a statement, the gist of which was: North China provinces and cities have suffered successive years of droughts and floods, with frequent natural disasters and poor harvests. As the spring and summer seasons intersect, grain prices are soaring and there are many starving people. The North China native-place associations in the capital are deeply saddened and have successively appealed to the Central Government for relief. The Chairman, deeply concerned about the suffering of the people, has promptly ordered the Ministry of Social Welfare and related departments to urgently devise measures. Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare, considering relief his responsibility, has been working tirelessly and is deeply concerned. Therefore, he has ordered me to rush to North China to investigate the disaster situation and submit a detailed report to facilitate coordinated relief efforts. He has also mobilized native-place associations in Ningbo, Shanghai, and the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi to expand public fundraising efforts, with those who have money contributing money, and those who have strength contributing strength. He has also requested the government to spare no effort to allocate relief funds and purchase grain to be transported north to alleviate the people's suffering. Because the disaster situation in Taikang and Shangqiu counties in Henan is particularly severe, 50,000 yuan has already been allocated to the Joint Savings Society for emergency relief. I am now ordered to come north to investigate the disaster, and I plan to stay for two weeks, determined to visit disaster-stricken households and speak on behalf of the people. I sincerely hope that the relevant authorities and charitable organizations will provide assistance to enable me to accomplish my mission.</p>

<h3>The Muddy Season on the Eastern Front Has Passed; Germany Prepares for Summer Offensive; Three Soviet Divisions Annihilated Near Krimskaya; German Victory Also Secured Near Velikiye Luki</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to German front-line reports, except for some local offensives in the Rzhev area in the central part of the Eastern Front, there is almost no fighting at the bridgehead and along the entire Eastern Front. However, in the past two days, Soviet troops have been frequently concentrating forces towards Kuban, south of Moscow, and the Leningrad area, apparently preparing to launch a major offensive. Furthermore, the German Air Force's offensive is becoming increasingly fierce, leading many to believe that the German summer offensive is imminent.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - A military correspondent from the Havas News Agency announced last night that the German army's local attacks in the Kuban bridgehead area were successfully concluded over the weekend. The Soviet penetration in the Krimskaya southwest front area has been eliminated. This area had been cut off after the last large-scale Soviet attack, but it still caused the German army great inconvenience. The Soviet army had gained a firm foothold in the forest and deep gorges that ran through the area and was constantly being reinforced from the rear. However, after two days of fierce fighting, it was finally overcome with very heavy losses. The German High Command said in a communiqué issued on May 16 that three Soviet infantry divisions had been wiped out in this relatively small area alone. The German army also won a similar victory west of Velikiye Luki on Sunday, eliminating a Soviet salient that had existed since the winter campaign. Along the entire front line, both sides have greatly intensified reconnaissance and scouting activities, and the air forces of both sides are also very active. However, it would be premature to conclude from these two locations that the lull in fighting since the end of March is now coming to an end. What can be said with certainty at present is that both sides are striving to ascertain the other's intentions. Now that the muddy season has passed and the terrain is suitable for large-scale battles, this is a matter of course. Both sides have gained freedom of action, and both general staffs must take into account the possibility that the other side will strike first. Therefore, the intensified reconnaissance activities on both sides may be defensive in nature, and both sides may continue to maintain this attitude, waiting for the other side to strike first. If this is the case, the current state of high alert and intensified reconnaissance on both sides may continue for many weeks. This development is entirely possible, although the chance of an early end to the lull is relatively high. It is dangerous to speculate at this time, and it remains to be seen which side will launch a large-scale offensive first.</p>
<h3>Italian Government and Public Display Resolve to Cope with Future Events; Senator Salata Delivers Speech Asserting Growing Solidarity Among Axis Powers</h3>
<p>Rome, 18th (Central News Agency) - A Havas correspondent reports that the Italian people have completely dispelled their grief over the Tunisia situation and are now facing the Allied military actions in the Mediterranean with determination and skepticism. Most of the people understand two things: first, the occupation of Tunisia does not decide the Mediterranean question; and second, the war has spread to the whole world, and the African theater is only an interlude. From government officials to ordinary vendors, everyone knows that the constant Allied propaganda about invading the Italian mainland and its islands is only intended to disrupt the morale of the Italian people. The prevailing view here is that the Anglo-Americans clearly imagine that the Italian spirit has been greatly weakened by the North African events, and the Italian people and authorities are making extensive preparations to prevent large-scale Allied air raids in order to counter this psychological pressure. In recent days, the public has been calmer and more disciplined when air raid alerts have been issued. The public does not show any panic over the expected enemy actions. The Italians declare frankly that the Anglo-American air force's current loss rate is very high, so how long they can continue to use the air force from Africa remains to be seen. As for the Allied landing on Italian soil, based on the experience of the North African campaign, the public is well aware that it will take a long time for the Allied forces to concentrate sufficient troops to fight in a certain location. Every Italian understands that Italy has various advantages and a perfect transportation system, so they are facing future events with the firm determination to defend the country.</p>
<p>Rome, 18th (Central News Agency) - Stefani News Agency reports: Italian Senator Salata delivered a speech yesterday during the Senate's discussion of the draft budget for the current fiscal year, stating that the solidarity between the German and Italian peoples has grown closer in the past year, and the increasing friendship and trust between the Italian Prime Minister and the German leader is not only a symbol but also a guarantee. He also encouraged the relationship between Italy and another great ally, Japan. The frequent diplomatic contacts and technical committees held among the foreign ministries of Rome, Berlin, and Tokyo have confirmed the function of the Tripartite Pact in wartime and peacetime, and between Europe and East Asia. He continued by stating the main points of the communiqué issued after the recent meeting between the German and Italian leaders. The new feeling caused by the current war has confirmed that the primary urgent task is the unification of Europe. All attempts to unite Europe in the past three centuries have been opposed by Britain, fearing that a united Europe would become its potential enemy. This conflict between Europe and Britain is the root of all crises and wars. He also reviewed Italian foreign policy and its relations with various European countries over the past year in his speech.</p>
<h3>Rumor Says British Navy Has Occupied Djembra Island</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Algiers, it is rumored that the British Navy occupied Djembra Island, about ten kilometers from Cape Bon, on the 17th.</p>
<h3>White House Denies Roosevelt-Churchill Meeting Halted</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - Yesterday, Washington and most parts of the United States were rife with rumors that President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill's discussions had been interrupted. The White House issued a denial statement last night, released to various American news agencies, stating that President Roosevelt continued to meet with the British Prime Minister and did not interrupt the meeting. He also held discussions with his special envoy to India, Phillips. The outside rumors are not credible. Phillips returned here before the British Prime Minister arrived in Washington and immediately reported to the President. India did not participate in the discussions between the British and American politicians.</p>
<h3>Davies' Visit to the Soviet Union Postponed</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to Washington sources, President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Soviet Union, Davies, has extended his stay in Tehran due to a special mission there. He will discuss the possibility of the United States establishing additional air bases in Iran. He may later visit India for the same purpose. Washington officials announced the postponement of Davies's trip to the Soviet Union, saying that Davies must hold important meetings with the Soviet ambassador and American officials in Tehran.</p>
<h3>Allied Forces in Tunisia Facing Difficulties in Food Supply</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Algiers, the Allied military authorities and the Giraud government in Tunisia suddenly felt difficulties in food and supply. Allied headquarters announced that large amounts of military supplies have been used to supply the public and the garrison, and food is now being rushed from Morocco and Algeria. However, the food markets in both places are also extremely short. Cooking oil is in short supply in Algeria, and cooking oil wholesalers want to import cooking oil from Tunisia, but they have been notified that the needs of the Allied forces must be met first, and a certain amount must be shipped to Britain and the United States. Therefore, the supply of civilians is feared to be extremely disappointing.</p>
<h3>Detailed Report on Japanese Occupation of Maungdaw; British Army Retreats Along Arakan Front in Burma; Increasing Numbers of Indian Troops Surrender Voluntarily</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 18th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army in Burma launched a fierce attack on Maungdaw, the remaining British and Indian troops stationed near the area fled westward upon hearing the news. The vanguard of the Japanese army entered Maungdaw city on the 14th without firing a shot. Maungdaw is located on the Indo-Burmese border, bordering the Naf River to the south. It was the last stronghold for the enemy's attempt to invade Burma, and it was also the largest transportation hub on the southern Indo-Burmese transportation line. Now that the area has fallen, the enemy has no choice but to completely abandon its attempt to recapture Burma. At the same time, the shortest route to India along the coast, Maungdaw, has also been seized by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 18th: (1) Japanese army units captured Maungdaw, an enemy stronghold on the banks of the Naf River on the Indo-Burmese border, at 2:00 PM on May 14 and are now preparing for future operations. (2) The comprehensive war results on the Arakan front from late December of last year to May 10 are as follows: (1) 6,414 enemy bodies were left behind (only those buried by the Japanese army). (2) 574 enemy troops were captured (including many British soldiers). (3) A total of 327 enemy aircraft were shot down (118 of which were shot down by ground fire), and 225 were set on fire. (4) The Japanese army seized 207 various cannons. (5) 459 heavy and light machine guns were seized. (6) 4,897 rifles and pistols were seized. (7) 83 tanks and armored vehicles were seized. (8) 255 trucks were seized. (9) 39 enemy ships were sunk or destroyed (including 16 ships of the 1,000-ton class), and countless other ammunition, food, and military supplies were seized. (2) In this campaign, the Japanese army had 714 killed, 1,364 wounded, and lost 48 aircraft.</p>
<h3>Japan Designates Medical Supplies as Basic Commodities</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government believes that supplying essential medical supplies and hygiene materials is crucial for directly ensuring combat power and public health. It has decided to make it a subordinate plan of the basic commodities mobilization in order to ensure supply. This plan is a product commodities mobilization plan based on the original materials already secured under the commodities mobilization plan. It includes all needs for military and civilian use, as well as exports. Since Japan's medical supplies have traditionally relied on supplies from third countries due to raw materials, and the demand is increasing under the Greater East Asia War, it is of great significance that a self-reliant commodities mobilization plan utilizing Greater East Asia raw materials has now been established, especially for medicines made from black oil, which has been successfully secured.</p>
<h3>Japan Decides on Self-Sufficiency Policy for Fibers in the South</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Under the guidance of the local Japanese military government, the cotton industry in various parts of the South has established a five-year plan for cotton cultivation. Due to the active efforts of the staff, the progress is extremely smooth. The Japanese government has now decided on a self-sufficiency policy for fiber manufacturing in the South. Cotton will be the raw material for fiber products in the South, and textile machines will be shipped from Japan to meet local needs.</p>
<h3>Wang Yitang Departs from Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - National Government Commissioner Wang Yitang arrived here on the 11th. On the 14th, he paid respects to His Majesty the Emperor of Japan and received a medal. He held discussions with Prime Minister Tojo and other government officials and inspected various aspects of the situation. He concluded his itinerary here and departed from Tokyo Station by train for Osaka on the morning of the 18th, with many officials and civilians seeing him off at the station.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - National Government Commissioner Wang Yitang held a tea party at the Seiyoken in Ueno, Tokyo, at 3:00 PM on the 17th, inviting dignitaries from Japanese government and public circles. Prime Minister Tojo, Chief of Staff Sugiyama, Generals Abe, Nishio, and Doihara, former Chairman of the Privy Council, Minister of Home Affairs Ando, Major General Arisue, Director of the Army Press Department Tani, Speaker of the House of Representatives Okada, and others attended, totaling over 100 people.

The guests and hosts chatted happily, and the party ended after about an hour.</p>
<h3>Director-General of the Japanese Planning Board Explains This Year's Trading Plan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Director-General of the Japanese Planning Board discussed the gist of the Showa 18 Trading Plan, saying that the purpose of the Showa 18 Trading Plan is to adapt to the new stage of the Greater East Asia War in order to achieve a decisive victory. It can be summarized in the following two major policies: (1) To facilitate the exchange of important materials in Greater East Asia, with Japan as the center, in order to rapidly increase war power and stabilize the people's livelihood in Greater East Asia. (2) To make the plan the axis for communicating the planned transactions of the entire Greater East Asia sphere. To ensure that the intent is achieved through the implementation of this plan, the following guidelines will be adhered to for export and import plans: (1) Exports: The items and quantities of materials exported from Japan will focus on the development materials aimed at increasing war power and the production of urgent materials that Japan expects from various regions, or materials necessary for transportation. At the same time, the stability of the local people's livelihood will be considered in accordance with the environment of each region before making decisions. (2) Imports: The items and quantities of materials imported into Japan will ensure the stability of the people's livelihood in each region, taking into account their development capabilities and the increase in transportation, and will use a certain limit of maritime transport capacity to plan for the greatest enrichment of the work of enhancing material war power and to fill the essential materials for national life. According to the contents of this plan established based on the above two policies and guidelines, the amount of expected targets has generally been reached on the export side. Especially for the occupied areas in the South, its achievements have increased considerably compared to last year. On the import side, the total amount has also increased significantly compared to last year.</p>
<h3>A Great Tragedy in World History (6)</h3>
<p>— Tokutomi Iichiro</p>
<p>(6) The Collapse and Disintegration of Colonies</p>
<p>Great Britain possesses centrifugal force without centripetal force. It is not that the latter is completely absent, but that centripetal force is overwhelmed by centrifugal force. Japan is an inward-enclosing nation, while Great Britain is an outward-extending one. Japan centers on the Imperial Household, with the Imperial Majesty like the sun in the solar system, around which everything revolves. Great Britain, on the other hand, lacks such a central unifying point. This is not to say that the British people are devoid of national character. As Motherning argues, Britain's island status allowed it to develop earlier than other European nations.</p>
<p>However, that national character transformed into a sense of Anglo-Saxon superiority, which was then disseminated throughout the world. The progeny of these so-called pirates, scattered across the globe, harbor but scant sentiment of loyalty towards their motherland, England. Indeed, twenty-five years prior to the American Revolution, Turgot of France presciently observed:</p>
<p>"Colonies are like fruits on a tree; when ripe, they detach themselves from the trunk and fall to the ground. No matter how things may develop in the future, America will ultimately become like Carthage."</p>
<p>Carthage had once been a Phoenician colony, only to eventually surpass Phoenicia itself. Looking at the situation today, it is impossible to deny the accuracy of Turgot's prediction regarding the future of America.</p>
<p>From the outset, the American colonists sought freedom from the political and religious constraints of their mother country, England. They were, from the beginning, not necessarily loyal subjects to their ancestral homeland.</p>
<p>England's predicament lay in its global expansion, which led to the gradual loosening of the bonds binding the colonies. In essence, its organizational web became too thin, leading to a situation of being too large to effectively manage. Sir Walter Raleigh, often hailed as the progenitor of the British Empire, once stated:</p>
<p>"The safety and perpetuity of the British Empire depend primarily on the uniformity of its people. Australia, New Zealand, and Canada exemplify this principle. However, in India, where race, religion, and language differ, the conquest was not achieved by British might, but by Indian soldiery. British forces constitute only one-fifth, while Indian forces comprise four-fifths. The Indians are well aware of this fact, which constitutes the inescapable bond that ties India to the motherland."</p>
<p>This is a nonsensical assertion. The Indians harbor deep resentment for the deceitful tactics employed by the British in conquering India, and there is no question of them feeling grateful or impressed by such methods.</p>
<p>During World War I, the aid proffered by Australia, South Africa, and India was taken as a sign of solid, unbreakable unity. However, this was merely a superficial assessment.</p>
<p>Their assistance to the mother country was driven by self-interest. India, it is true, contributed over 150 million pounds to war bonds, donated 100 million pounds, and deployed 800,000 troops. But what motivated India's enthusiasm? It was the belief that they would be granted the coveted freedoms and self-governance after the war. Yet, in the aftermath, the British seemingly forgot their promises, offering stones in place of bread. Thus, India's independence movement now rages before our very eyes.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the case of Canada, had it inclined toward Germany, the neighboring United States would have undoubtedly taken action. For its own security, the United States would have either conquered Canada militarily or, failing that, exerted economic pressure. Therefore, Canada opted to remain dependent on Britain, producing war materials and dispatching volunteers.</p>
<p>The same holds true for Australia. Its participation in the Allied Powers, and its alignment with Great Britain, was a matter of expediency. Moreover, the connection between Great Britain and Australia was sustained by the assistance of the Japanese Navy, a readily apparent fact. Had Australia sided with the Allied nations, the Japanese Navy would have promptly blockaded it!</p>
<p>In South Africa, the Smuts faction, then in power, aligned with the mother country in order to suppress their political rivals, the German party. Consequently, during the Versailles Conference, figures such as Borden of Canada, Smuts of South Africa, and especially Hughes of Australia, behaved as if the conference hall were their own, debating with disregard for the British representatives, Lloyd George and Balfour. Regardless of the British Empire's continued perception of the external colonies as British territory, they considered themselves independent nations, expressing a determination to remain independent. A significant gulf thus opened up between Great Britain and its colonies. During the celebration of Queen Victoria's fiftieth jubilee, a conference was convened with the prime ministers of various colonies. According to Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister at the time, any discussion of the constitution of the British Empire at the prime ministers' conference would plunge into a state of chaos: "Instead of discussing such issues, we should discuss the practical problems of common defense within the British Empire." While politicians in the mother country were enthusiastic, colonial politicians were indifferent to anything beyond their own lands. This discordant state of affairs existed between the British Prime Minister and the prime ministers of the various colonies even in the most prosperous era of Great Britain, during the fiftieth jubilee of Queen Victoria. What more could be said of later times?</p>
<p>Furthermore, despite having historically been an agricultural nation, Canada, as a result of manufacturing war materials for the mother country during World War I, transitioned into a semi-industrialized state. Australia also exhibited a similar trend, thus coming to compete with the mother country. Moreover, with the establishment of the League of Nations, each colony dispatched its representatives as members, each pursuing its own interests. The objective of the British Imperialist politicians to incorporate them within the sphere of the British Empire and to regulate their activities became nearly impossible. The British imperialist politicians were like a mother hen, while the prime ministers of the various colonies were the chicks hatched by that hen. Regardless of the mother hen's frantic clucking, the chicks each flew off to the water on their own. Thus, in 1926, the predictions of British politicians came to fruition, and the decision was made to remove the constitutive framework of the British Empire. The British Empire, as well as the territories of the British Empire, were transformed into autonomous entities within the British Empire, linked solely by the crown as a symbol of common loyalty. Beyond that, internal affairs, foreign policy, all were self-governing.</p>
<p>Prior to that, in 1923, when Canada and the United States concluded a fisheries treaty, the Canadian government openly stated its disapproval of the signing by the British ambassador to Washington. Thus, apart from loyalty to the crown, there was no relationship between the mother country and the dependencies, and they became completely unconnected.</p>
<p>In accordance with the decision of the 1931 Imperial Conference, the so-called Statute of Westminster was promulgated, and the British Empire, as mentioned above, placed Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, and Newfoundland on an equal footing with the mother country. By this point, the British Empire had, in effect, almost entirely collapsed and disintegrated.</p>
<p>Therefore, during the so-called Ottawa Conference of 1932, Great Britain abandoned its traditional free trade policy and implemented tariffs, applying free trade policies only within the British Empire. This measure was only beneficial to the colonies, and had no effect on Great Britain itself. Why is this the case? Even if the colonies eliminated tariff barriers against the mother country, they would benefit, while Great Britain would lose its position in the world as a result.

<h3>Authorities Concerned about Disaster in North China: Discussing Relief Measures, Minister Ding Arrives in Shanghai to Meet Mayor Chen, Inviting Various Sectors to Discuss Jointly Today</h3>
<p>This year's disaster in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces is quite serious, and relief is urgently needed. In Henan province alone, there are approximately ten million disaster victims. After representatives from the provinces petitioned in Beijing and the responsible North China authorities reported to the Central Government, Chairman Wang has ordered the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Ministry of Food to raise funds and grain separately to handle relief matters. The North China Associations in Beijing and Shanghai have also organized the North China Emergency Relief Association to raise relief funds. The Shanghai office of the association will also be established within days to plan relief measures. However, because the disaster area is vast and the number of victims is too large, effective relief will depend on the cooperation of powerful sectors of civil society. Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare, aware of this, made a special trip to Shanghai. After consulting with Mayor Chen, they decided to hold a tea party at 4 PM today in the Peacock Hall on the second floor of the International Hotel, jointly invited by Mayor Chen and Minister Ding, to gather leaders from all sectors of the city to discuss relief measures. Representatives from the North China Associations in Beijing and Shanghai will also be invited to participate to report on the disaster situation in North China. It is reported that the fundraising efforts have already decided to organize a grand gathering of famous Peking opera performers, charity football matches, and charity horse races to raise large sums of money for disaster relief in the affected areas. Shanghai, as the economic center of the country, always feels a sense of hunger and drowning with these disaster victims who are crying out for food and is eager to contribute.</p>

<h3>Second Phase of Epidemic Prevention Begins: Vaccination Centers Intensify Services</h3>
<p>The second phase of the epidemic prevention campaign has begun in this city this week. All vaccination centers, including the free vaccination centers set up by the health authorities and the vaccination centers set up by various Bao-Jia organizations themselves, have increased staff to serve and intensify vaccinations starting yesterday. Residents of the Chengdu and Xinzha districts of the Public Concession have been assigned dates for vaccination by the Bao-Jia authorities. Those who have delayed or failed to comply have also been urged by the Bao-Jia leaders in charge. It is expected that all residents of the two districts will be vaccinated by the end of this month. In other districts, most residents have also automatically applied to the health sub-bureaus. As for a portion who have privately requested doctors to administer vaccinations, the doctor's certificate must be exchanged for an official epidemic prevention certificate at the Health Bureau on Hankou Road, otherwise it will still be invalid.</p>
<h3>Clearing Garbage in the Nanshi District: Allocation of 700,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The garbage throughout the entire Nanshi district, which has been suspended for nearly four months, is currently being thoroughly cleared by the Nanshi Office of the Health Bureau. In recent days, more than 3,000 truckloads of garbage have already been removed from the Zhonghua Road area alone. In order to ensure the public health of the citizens in the Nanshi district, the Municipal Government has specifically allocated a large sum of 700,000 yuan to expedite the clearing. The office has also ordered the garbage contractors to clear all the garbage in the entire Nanshi district within 35 days. A contract has been signed stipulating that a fine of 5,000 yuan will be imposed for each day of delay. As a result, the garbage on the streets and alleys of the Nanshi district has been gradually decreasing in recent days, and it is expected that it will be completely removed within the time limit.</p>
<h3>When Self-Defense Corps Members Change Posts, They Must Verify Citizen Certificates: If an Unfortunate Incident Occurs Due to Negligence, the Relief Member Shall Bear Full Responsibility</h3>
<p>The Bao-Jia authorities of the two concessions have recently discovered that unscrupulous individuals have been impersonating self-defense corps members to take over posts and fraudulently obtain armbands, etc., with the intention of plotting wrongdoing. This situation has been seen repeatedly, greatly affecting social security. Therefore, the Bao-Jia authorities yesterday ordered on-duty corps members that during shift changes, they must request the other party's post-taking certificate to verify the date, time, and location of the post. At the same time, they must also request the person taking over the post to show their citizen certificate, and only after verifying that it matches the name on the certificate may they hand over the items, so as to avoid scams. If a self-defense corps member neglects to carefully inspect the credentials of the person taking over the post, resulting in being deceived, in addition to being punished according to the regulations for losing armbands, the corps member must bear full responsibility if an unfortunate incident occurs in the future. Also, summer has arrived, and self-defense corps members are not allowed to wear wooden clogs or untidy clothing while on duty, otherwise it will be regarded as a violation of the duty rules. Therefore, it is hoped that the self-defense corps members of the two concessions will pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Flat-Priced Cigarettes: Limited to One Pack per Person</h3>
<p>The fourth phase of goods distribution by the China Central Tobacco Allocation Cooperative has been completed. The wholesale and retail merchants who sell cigarettes will distribute the goods they receive evenly over ten days. As for the fifth phase of goods distribution, it has already begun. Wholesale and retail merchants have paid for the goods based on the notification slips and will pick up the goods for sale. Regarding the purchase of cigarettes, it is limited to one pack per person. This regulation applies not only to smokers in all sectors of the city but also to employees of all levels of the cooperative. If anyone forcibly buys more than one pack of any kind of cigarette, wholesale and retail merchants are allowed to report it secretly at any time for strict punishment. As for any distribution firms that hoard and refuse to sell, buyers are also allowed to report it at any time.</p>
<h3>Robbery Case in the Nanshi District: Self-Defense Corps Catches a Thief</h3>
<p>At 9:20 PM last night, four robbers suddenly broke into the Zhonghua Store at 875 Zhonghua Road in the Nanshi district. Posing as customers, two robbers immediately produced pistols and threatened the owner and others, robbing 200 storage coupons, two pairs of small yellow leather shoes, and one pair of women's black leather shoes. They also stripped off the gold ring worn by the store owner, Xu Wenqi, and fled with the loot. After the Taimen police station in charge learned of the incident, they immediately dispatched patrol officers to search for the robbers everywhere. As a result, one robber, named Zhang Jingen, 26 years old, from Pudong, residing in Dashimingzhong in the Public Concession, was captured by the self-defense corps at the intersection of North Jiangyin Street. He confessed to colluding with others to rob with weapons. He was sent to the main bureau for handling.</p>
<h3>Commemoration of Zhang Liying's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of Madame Chen Youren's Zhang Liying's solo oil painting exhibition. People from all walks of life went to the Capital Hotel to visit enthusiastically. In one day, there were no less than a thousand people. Visitors have praised Zhang Nvshi's exquisite art, such as the incisiveness of the painting titles, and the wonderful coloring, as well as being an outstanding oil painter in our country. More than fifty pieces of artwork were displayed, all carefully constructed by Zhang Nvshi over the years, unwilling to part with them, so they are all non-saleable items. It was heard yesterday that a visitor planned to purchase an oil painting for the price of 100,000 yuan, but it was not fulfilled. The preciousness of Zhang Nvshi's works can be seen from this. The exhibition will continue to be open to the public for four days, until the 22nd, from 10 AM to 6 PM daily, without admission fee. All art lovers are welcome to come and enjoy.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>After the publication of Mr. Wang Zhenxiang's article "Abolish Miscellaneous Taxes" in the National Forum of this newspaper on the 17th, this newspaper received a letter from the Municipal Government Feast Tax Collection Office stating: "The Feast Tax is established by the Municipal Government to subsidize education funds. The question of whether to keep or abolish it is a small matter for discussion. As for Mr. Wang's statement that the monthly submission is only 30,000 yuan, while the actual collection exceeds 500,000 yuan, I do not know which district in this city he is referring to. The feast tax in this city is divided into several districts, such as West Shanghai, Xu Cao, Nanshi, and Pudong, which are organized separately. I do not know the situation in other districts. If it is in our West Shanghai district, it is only enough to maintain the salaries of employees in addition to the submission. As for Mr. Wang's statement that the actual collection "exceeds" 500,000 yuan, please specify which district he is referring to, so as to clarify the facts."</p>

<h3>Two Pre-requisite Problems for Relieving North China Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>-- A Reader</p>
<p>After reading the article "Speaking for the Disaster Victims in North China", I was deeply moved. The waterways in the North are poorly managed, and disasters occur with every drought. This is a fundamental problem, and I will not discuss it for the time being. The disaster area is vast this year, and the disaster situation is serious. The urgency of relief is self-evident. Relief requires money. Your newspaper has repeatedly urged contributions, which is extremely important. However, as far as I can see, there are two points in the outline of the prerequisites for disaster relief that must be planned and resolved first. If these two points cannot be resolved, even if millions of funds are collected, it will still be useless for disaster relief. I dare to present them below:</p>
<p>Now is the height of summer. The clothing and housing of the disaster victims are not the most urgent. The most urgent thing is still food. The staple food of the people in that area has always been coarse grains. Now that the harvest has failed, the only things to rely on for transportation are the Manchurian State and the areas north of Shanxi. However, at this time of military tension, everything (especially food) is subject to unified management for production, sales, and transportation. Moreover, Manchuria, Mongolia, and North China are divided into three regions. And the production of grain in the Manchurian State and the areas north of Shanxi has its designated purposes. Now, if we want to change the transportation to Shandong and Henan for disaster relief, we must thoroughly negotiate and comprehensively plan with friendly countries, otherwise the results will be empty talk. During this period of negotiation and planning, the disaster victims cannot wait with empty stomachs, and a huge number will inevitably die again. The tragedy is unspeakable. How can we exert all our strength to quickly negotiate a solution with friendly countries? This is the sole responsibility of the central and local authorities. This is the first point. Now, the troops and bandits in various places are mixed, and transportation is also limited. The long-distance and short-distance transportation of food is not smooth, and even the actions of the disaster relief and distribution personnel are a problem. Even the selection of such personnel is difficult. The corresponding moral skills for disaster relief and distribution are basic requirements, but today they feel like something rarely seen. How can we respond to emergencies and be practical? This is the most important and must be resolved first. It is also something that the central and local authorities must discuss and decide immediately. This is the second point. If the above two points cannot be resolved, then the so-called fundraising and disaster relief are all empty talk. No matter how much money society raises and how much money the government allocates, it is all just official formalities and will not help. The millions of compatriots in the two places will only have to wait for death. I clearly know that it is not easy to resolve the above situation, but there is no other way to set up a fundamental method except for this, and there is no power to do it except for the government. Therefore, based on my conscience, I dare to present it as above. I think friendly people, at a time of cooperation and mutual support in East Asia, will have infinite sympathy for such a serious situation, and the frequent hunger and wandering are closely related to the security development of various places and the situation of the overall East. It is expected that they will not turn a blind eye. As for the central and local authorities, they have the responsibility of relief, so there is no need for us to say more.</p>
<p>Economic Circle: Commentary</p>
<h3>Supporting Legitimate Enterprise Organizations</h3>
<p>Our country's industry is backward, and various production enterprises are very immature. After the war, although the increase in the value of materials temporarily presents a distorted prosperity, many of them are strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and the content of their business still needs to be enriched. In the past year or two, there have been many emerging enterprise companies, among which there are many who invest in industry and support production as their mission. Moreover, the factories they have established are all necessary for people's daily life and have been recognized by the society. The government should pay attention to correcting enterprise companies that operate improperly and should reward and encourage various enterprise organizations that support production for the sake of developing China's industry and national industry. As the "Continental News" said on April 29: "During the period of promoting the new economic policy, we should encourage the establishment of financial, commercial, and industrial institutions that can promote the revival of industrial production. However, commercial institutions that are not related to industrial production, as well as those that are only superficially related, and even companies with no reserves... are issues worthy of attention."</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the authorities must actively guide this faction of enterprises - those that are not related to industrial production and even have no reserves. The government should provide guidance on the direction of business, the procedures for operation, the steps to accelerate production, and the methods to promote material exchange at any time, correct their shortcomings, and improve their functions, so that all enterprise organizations can only follow the government's lead and work together on unified economic management, so as to complete the task of national economic mobilization, so that the government and private enterprise organizations can become one, and China's immature industrial state can develop and grow, and jointly pursue the advanced countries. Wouldn't it be wonderful and grand?</p>
<h3>Japanese Chamber of Commerce Actively Improves Organizational Structure, Establishes Control Section to Adjust Japanese-Chinese Economy</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the central organization of the China Economic Commerce Control Association, the control mechanism of the Central China economy has gradually been put in place. The Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce, which is in a position to guide the Japanese economic community in Shanghai, previously established the Shanghai Economic Construction Committee, the Japanese Business Countermeasures Committee, and the Japanese-Chinese Problem Committee, enlisting the cooperation of major figures from all walks of life to promote the new policy toward China while seeking the welfare of Japanese businesses. Furthermore, in order to adapt to the new era, it was decided to expand and strengthen the organization of the Chamber of Commerce itself. Managing Director Takeuchi was appointed to draft a plan, which has been approved and implemented since the 15th after being passed at the general meeting on the 14th.</p>
<p>Organizational Points</p>
<p>The original Intelligence Section will be renamed the Planning Section. In addition to collecting intelligence and reporting on matters, all economic matters and matters related to liaison and negotiation with official and economic organizations will be handled by the Planning Section. Therefore, the center of the Chamber of Commerce will be placed in the planning aspect. The scope of the Investigation Section will be expanded to include the data room, investigation space, and statistics, responding to the Planning Section's investigation of economic trends, being responsible for researching and investigating the static state of the economy, and adding a Control Section. Adapting to the economic circles of Central China in which the transfer of the control economic mechanism takes place, it will guide the Japanese economic circles and bear a very important mission, specializing in the control of guilds and other economic organizations, and in charge of the consolidation and merger of industry and commerce, investigation of business conditions, and matters of Chinese economic control organizations. Regarding the unemployment or impact on Japanese businesses after the promotion of the new economic policy, this section will take close contact with the Japanese Business Countermeasures Committee, etc., and be responsible for control and guidance.</p>
<p>Economic Consultation</p>
<p>The Commercial Consultation Office will be renamed the Economic Consultation Office. At this important military stage, the association also attaches great importance to the personnel issues of the consultation office. In order to facilitate work, the current Director's Office Secretariat will be expanded into the Executive Director's Office. The General Affairs Section and Accounting Section will be renamed the General Affairs Department and Finance Department in order to unify the names. The names of the Publication Section will remain unchanged, but the publication policy, which has always been targeted at the local area, will be adjusted. Under the policy of integrating the entire Chinese economy with the entire Japanese domestic economy, publication matters will be improved. In terms of organization, there will be a Director-General of the Secretariat and a Deputy Director-General of the Secretariat. The Director-General will be the ex officio Managing Director, and the Deputy Director-General will be the ex officio Deputy Director of the Chamber of Commerce. As for other personnel changes, they are still under careful consideration. In addition, regarding the revitalization of Chinese rural areas, experienced people in rural affairs have been gathered to prepare for the establishment of a Rural Countermeasures Committee. Regarding this reform of the organization, Managing Director Takeuchi specially issued a statement saying that due to the promotion of the policy toward China, the economic circles of Japanese residents will inevitably be affected to a considerable extent. Therefore, rather than striving to reduce the impact, it is better to aim at enriching the Japanese economic situation, so that those affected will not feel uncomfortable, and work will be promoted from the perspective of unifying ideas, and he is willing to assist the implementation of the new policy from the sidelines.

<h3>Economic Bureau Continues to Appoint Conveners for Sixteen Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau, in order to comply with Item A of Article 5 of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy, will adjust all kinds of old economic institutions that are not suitable for the wartime economic system. In accordance with the current Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Guilds, the Bureau will first adjust the guilds of major commodities in the city, urging adjustments. Since the 1st of this month, initiators of guilds of major commodities have been successively appointed, and more than ten industries are actively preparing for organization. It is learned that the Bureau yesterday (18th) continued to appoint initiators for sixteen guilds in the city, including the leather manufacturing industry, and set a deadline for completion of the organization by the end of this month for reporting and verification. The list of conveners of the guilds is as follows: (1) Leather Manufacturing Industry: Du Huafang (2) Soap and Candle Factory Industry: Zhou Bangjun (3) Glass Store Industry: Chen Jianting (4) Paint Store Industry: Li Shuyan (5) Chemical Industrial Raw Materials Store Industry: Xie Xiaochu (6) Rubber Products Store Industry: Wang Jingdong (7) Tobacco Factory Industry: Shen Weiting (8) Leather Store Industry: Xu Wenbiao (9) Raw Hide Industry: Xiao Miancai (10) Silk Store Industry: Cao Minglie (11) Leather Products Store Industry: Wang Yizhi (12) Wool Yarn Store Industry: Shen Laizhou (13) Wool Textile Factory Industry: Cheng Nianpeng (14) Raw Wool Industry: Huar Kang (15) Chemical Industry: Liang Shaokun (16) Woolen Cloth Store Industry: Ge Jechen.</p>
<h3>Commerce Control Association: Flour and Wheat Special Committee Established</h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Special Committee, under the supervision of the Ministry of Food and the General Association of Commercial Control, has been organized and established. The address is located on the third floor of the Silk Building at No. 2 Beijing Road. It has begun operations and will hold a tea party at 4:30 PM tomorrow (20th) on the first floor of the Cathay Hotel to entertain guests from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Establishment of Sino-Japanese Flour and Wheat Organization</p>
<p>Also, the reporter has learned that the lower-level organization of the Flour and Wheat Special Fighting Committee has been closely reviewed by the relevant authorities as soon as possible. It has been determined that the organization of the committee will include both Chinese and Japanese flour food organizations. The Chinese side is the Flour and Wheat Industry Federation, and the Japanese side is the reorganized and downsized China Branch Flour Milling Industry Federation. At the general meeting held in the middle of this month, the association decided to divide its internal organization into three departments: collection, processing, and distribution.</p>
<p>Chinese Distribution Organization Established Separately</p>
<p>The organization under the Federation is the Flour and Wheat Industry Association, which includes both Chinese and Japanese flour and wheat industries. The Japanese members of the association include the collection, processing, and distribution departments, while the Chinese members of the association include the collection and processing departments. The distribution department is set up separately. According to the reporter, this separate organization is temporary in nature and will be reorganized when necessary.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Association Lending Methods Limited to Industrial and Commercial Firms</h3>
<p>The two joint reserve treasuries of the silver and money industry, in order to prevent the use of goods as collateral to apply for lending funds, have been extremely careful in handling interbank lending. It is specifically stipulated that those who provide property to apply for loans must be legitimate factories or businesses, and the purpose must not be to hoard for profit. The total evaluation should not exceed 25% of the total amount of lending approved for each bank. The total amount of lending shall not exceed the sum of the paid-up capital and public reserve of each bank. After the price is assessed, the discount is: (1) For those with a limited price, 60% of the limited price. (2) For those without a limited price, 30% of the assessed price. The lending period is set at ten days, but it may be returned in advance and no extension may be applied for. At the same time, it is hoped that the industry will maintain its strength to ensure safety. If it is not necessary, it is best not to lend. The purpose of lending is purely for the necessity of the industry. When its payment ability is not sufficient, it should be given some chips as assistance. It is not to provide low-interest funds to the industry on a regular basis for usual operations.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Resume Trading Today</h3>
<p>Since applying to the Municipal Economic Bureau for registration and obtaining business licenses, fifteen Chinese stock firms in this city, including Xinfeng, Baofeng, and Wufu stock companies, have already obtained licenses and are scheduled to officially resume trading on the 19th of this month. It is learned that after the resumption of trading by the fifteen stock companies, the business hours are set from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM daily, with Sundays and holidays off. The commission is still charged at 0.5% of the transaction amount, and the Shanghai Special Municipal Supplementary Levy on Chinese Stock Trading Provisional Measures will be followed, and the selling client will pay a certification fee of 5 jiao of national currency for every 1,000 yuan of the actual transaction amount (calculated as 1,000 yuan even if the amount is less than 1,000 yuan). It is heard that the Economic Bureau will also issue the licenses for the third batch of stock traders soon.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Assesses Standard Price of Spring Cocoons</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that the spring cocoon industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has already been launched, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially invited representatives from the Construction Departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to hold a spring cocoon valuation meeting on the 15th of this month in order to unify the purchase price. A public decision was immediately made on the standard price of spring cocoons, and all silk manufacturers and remaining cocoon merchants were ordered to comply. The reporter of this newspaper inquired from the Acting Bureau yesterday and obtained detailed information: (A) Improved Variety Fresh Cocoon Price (1) 380 jin reeling per dan (Sima weight) 2816 yuan, market weight 2286 yuan. (2) 400 jin reeling per dan (Sima weight) 2675 yuan, market weight 2172 yuan. (3) 420 jin reeling per dan (Sima weight) 2548 yuan, market weight 2069 yuan. (B) The price of native fresh cocoons is calculated at 70% of the reeling price of improved varieties, and it is stipulated that 300 jin of fresh cocoons dried into 100 jin of dry cocoons is the reeling standard. It is also heard that spring cocoons in Haining and Jiaxing, Zhejiang have been launched, and silk manufacturers and remaining cocoon merchants in Shanghai are allowed to freely purchase them according to the standard price set by the Ministry. However, the counties in Jiangsu Province limit the cocoon-receiving manufacturers to those who have silk reeling factories in the province. The Shanghai concession area is not in the province of Jiangsu. Therefore, silk manufacturers in Shanghai have requested the Jiangsu Construction Department to allow them to freely purchase in various parts of Jiangsu Province.</p>
<h3>Liang Shao Soil Yellow Wine Limited Price Approved</h3>
<p>The limited price of various wines for the Liang Shao Wine Industry Association in this city has been approved by the authorities of the two concessions as follows:</p>

The remuneration is 30 to 50 yuan per thousand words. This announcement.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Guilds Not in Line With Wartime Economy to Cease Activities Immediately</h3>
<p>The Municipal Food and Economic Bureaus of this city, having previously received orders from the Ministry to strengthen the wartime economic mechanism, reorganize the industrial and commercial guilds of major commodities in the urban area, and establish joint associations of industrial and commercial guilds, have commissioned widely respected preparatory members to establish the preparatory offices of the joint associations, which have been disclosed in newspapers. All original industrial and commercial guilds and similar organizations that are not in line with the wartime economic mechanism have now received orders from the Ministry of Food and Industry to immediately cease activities and to submit the seals and stamps issued by the former competent authorities within a time limit to avoid division and ensure uniformity.</p>

<h3>My Views on the Resumption of Trading of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>Chinese stock trading has been suspended for three months since mid-February, when the relevant department of the Engineering Bureau considered it to be speculative and ordered stock traders to stop trading. Initially, although news about the resumption of trading could be seen intermittently in the newspapers, it was sometimes tight and sometimes loose, and it did not materialize. Recently, it was only seen that the relevant authorities officially permitted the resumption of trading and the records of the joint announcement of stock traders. Then, in the future, Chinese stock trading will reappear in the economic circles of Shanghai in a new posture.</p>
<p>I consider myself to be someone who is slightly concerned about the stock business, so I naturally pay attention to the dynamics of the stock business and its future development. However, I am neither the issuer of stocks, nor the holder, nor the employee of a stock trader; in my personal capacity, the rise and fall of the stock business does not directly affect my interests. The reason for my concern and attention to the stock business is entirely based on "the relationship between the stock business and the Chinese economic circles"; it can also be said that how to revitalize China's economic business, especially the industrial and commercial economy, is the main object of my concern and attention. Because the stock business has a close relationship with the industrial and commercial economy, it has also become a subsidiary object of my concern and attention. Although these few sentences are superfluous, in order to explain that I have an objective view of the stock business, I have to say them.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks are a kind of securities representing the assets of Chinese industrial and commercial businesses. Therefore, its circulation is the circulation of funds in industrial and commercial businesses, which is enough to revitalize the use of industrial and commercial funds and promote the prosperity of business. There is probably no doubt about this. At the same time, new industrial and commercial businesses, or industrial and commercial businesses with plans and prospects, lack the use of funds, then issuing stocks to absorb funds and seek legitimate outlets for those who own funds is probably also not a small doubt, but a certainty. The emergence of stock trading markets under such circumstances is, I dare say, not only an absolute need, but a necessity. At present, theories and articles that regard Chinese stocks as legitimate investments, promote increased production, and prosper the economy are heard and seen a lot, and I do not want to repeat them. I believe that the essence of Chinese stock trading is indeed the medium needed for the current prosperity of industrial and commercial businesses. The competent authorities should give active promotion in the supervision and guidance, and on the one hand, establish a formal market as soon as possible, and on the other hand, lead stock traders to organize guilds to guide Chinese stock traders into a legitimate track. It is necessary to recognize that the so-called drawbacks of speculation are caused by the failure to go through proper supervision methods and letting them evolve naturally. Even if there is the reality of its drawbacks, one cannot only blame the operators and forget the competent authorities' abandonment of responsibility. This is especially to be reflected on. "It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost." It is very gratifying that Chinese stock trading has been restored. In the future, I hope that the competent economic authorities must recognize their own responsibilities and the relationship between the Chinese stock business and the entire economic circle, and quickly plan the two things mentioned above. Then, the past mistakes will not be repeated, and the prosperity of industrial and commercial businesses and the outlets for idle funds will all have a bright future. I would like to offer this to the relevant authorities and economic figures on the occasion of celebrating the resumption of Chinese stock trading.</p>

<h3>"Speech" and "Action"</h3>
<p>— Fangcao</p>
<p>"Speech" and "action" are two methods of expressing a person's thoughts and personality. "Speech" not only comes out of the mouth and takes the form of sound, but also uses words to express it. Ancient emperors often used "abdominal defamation" against others, creating many "possibly existing" crimes. This was a product of despotic tyranny and belonged to an exception. "Action" includes two aspects: actively doing and passively not doing. The former is an obvious action, and the latter is a tacit inaction. In fact, both are "action," but the two are just different in form!</p>
<p>The sage said: "Observe his speech and examine his actions." When a person's "speech" and "action" cannot be consistent, it is often due to the instability and elusiveness of his thoughts. For example, when "speaking," his thoughts are immersed in a certain state. When he goes to "act," his thoughts change, deviating to another state. As a result, "speech" and "action" do not match, and they are completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>Some people overemphasize the "speech" side and forget the "action" completely. Their discussions are truly eloquent. There is also a kind of heroic spirit that swallows mountains and rivers, which is a bit awe-inspiring. But when we examine their "actions," we will be surprised and astonished at those actions, and even dare not believe that they would do those behaviors. There are many similar examples, and we can easily find them around us.</p>
<p>We must be careful to guard against other people's "speech" and "action," but the most important thing is whether our own "speech" and "action" can achieve the point where "speech" is followed by "action." If we only care about saying beautiful and pleasing words on the surface, but in reality "speech" does not take "action" into account, and we are unwilling to earnestly fulfill our promises, to be honest, this kind of armchair strategy is of no practical effect.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, those in power must handle political affairs efficiently and effectively. Even when it comes to personal private affairs, it seems that the key to achieving an invincible position is whether they can personally implement them. As for the amount of "speech," whether it is pleasant to listen to, are all unimportant matters that can be ignored and valued.</p>
<h3>Perseverance</h3>
<p>— Zhenquan</p>
<p>Napoleon once said: "Victory belongs to those who have strong perseverance." After a thorough investigation, we know that perseverance relies on three things: purpose, will, and enthusiasm. Purpose can concentrate our strength, will can strengthen our beliefs, and enthusiasm maintains our interest and eliminates all obstacles.</p>
<p>In a sense, life is a battle. A person who relies solely on cleverness and luck will always fail. Perseverance is the driving force of the solid soul, holding the key to the knowledge storehouse. From there, the world will prosper and civilization will advance.</p>
<p>Great people never wait for opportunities. They create opportunities. They seize reality and solve it immediately, and eventually overcome everything. The greatest thing that mankind can do in the present world is to utilize the materials given to him by the environment. This is the only way to succeed.</p>
<p>The most important lesson in life is to study how to gain victory from failure. It takes great perseverance to humbly find out the reasons for the setbacks after suffering unfortunate setbacks. At the same time, this can also be said to be the difference between success and failure. To know that one who cannot struggle to improve and cannot endure the pain of failure will not know the true meaning of success.</p>
<h3>Courage</h3>
<p>— Zonglu</p>
<p>Mencius said: "Brandishing a sword and glaring, saying, 'How dare he resist me!' This is the courage of a common man, who can defeat one person."</p>
<p>Su Shi of Dongpo said: "A common man, when insulted, draws his sword and rises up, fighting with his life. This is not enough to be courage. The world has great courage. He is slightly surprised when he suddenly encounters it, and slightly angry when it is added to him for no reason. This is because what he holds is very great, and his ambition is very far."</p>
<p>Zhang Zai of Hengqu said: "To establish a heart for heaven and earth, to establish a destiny for the people, to continue the unique learning for the past sages, and to create peace for all generations. Only then can it be said to be great courage."</p>
<h3>The Purpose and Method of Learning Japanese</h3>
<p>— Long Zhending</p>
<p>Mr. Uchiyama Kanzo wrote an article six or seven years ago entitled "A Person's Habits." At the beginning, he pointed out that many unfortunate events often occur between Chinese and Japanese people. After thinking and researching, most of them are due to differences in mutual habits and language barriers. ... At the end of the article, he concluded, "In short, the people of both China and Japan should understand each other's habits and language in all aspects, so that they can prevent misunderstandings on a personal level! They can solve international disputes on a large scale..." This is a fair comment, and it is indeed prescient.</p>
<p>Since the Incident, there have been many Japanese people studying our country's language, and there are even more Chinese people studying Japanese. As Mr. Hashimoto Kansetsu said: "... The popularity of Japanese... especially in China, one of the reasons for the convenience is the similarity of the characters; (the author's note: probably refers to the convenience of learning) another reason can be said to be due to utilitarian thinking, such as knowing Japanese, one can quickly get a job..." (see the Free Talk in this newspaper on May 7) However, according to the author's observation: most of the current learners are still like Uchiyama Kanzo said, in order to understand a little Japanese, they can avoid misunderstandings on both sides. Because it is very painful, many Chinese people, especially travelers, have suffered a lot from not knowing Japanese in the past, so many people think that "it is more convenient to understand Japanese" before learning Japanese.</p>
<p>In fact, the purpose of learning Japanese should not be too proud, nor should it be too timid. That's right, learning Japanese, like learning English, can facilitate conversation and business, and can read newspapers and do translations. It can be said that these are all legitimate purposes, but if one is determined to use Japanese as a tool to study Japanese literature, study social sciences, or take "communication between the two countries' cultures" as a mission and purpose, then that is naturally a step further!</p>
<p>Most people who learn Japanese hope to "complete it quickly." Although Chinese and Japanese characters have many similarities, making it easier for Chinese people to learn Japanese than any other country (conversely, it is also easier for Japanese people to learn Chinese;) however, every language has its own life and characteristics. If you have the close idea that "this matter is very easy" at the beginning and do not pay close attention to it and study it carefully, then not only will you not be able to "complete it quickly," but you will also create the joke of "drawing a tiger and failing to become like a dog."</p>
<p>Japanese text is mixed with many Chinese characters. On the one hand, this makes Chinese people feel very interested in learning the language. On the other hand, it prevents Chinese people from deeply understanding Japanese, because many Chinese characters can be understood literally, and are very similar to Chinese characters, but there are also many Chinese characters whose readers are not different and whose meaning is simply irrelevant to Chinese. For example, the meaning of "油斷大敵" is: "Carelessness is harmful, and you must not be lazy," the meaning of "馬鹿" is: "Bastard"; and the meaning of "大丈夫" is "firm," and the meaning of "勉强" is "study hard"... It is really countless!</p>
<p>In short, "haste makes waste" in everything. Learning Japanese and only understanding a little pidgin conversation or memorizing dozens or hundreds of grammar rules will not help. Only by not being impatient or taking shortcuts! Learn step by step, start with spoken language, then study "written language," and at the same time, on the one hand, try to practice "conversation," and on the other hand, you must pay attention to "syntax," advancing with each other! Only then can you feel a strong interest and gain a deep understanding; this is the only way to truly achieve the so-called purpose of fast success. Otherwise, like ordinary people blindly seeking fast success, it is simply fishing in a tree, and if you are lucky, you can only taste a little bit of fur.</p>
<h3>Genius and Environment</h3>
<p>— Tong Qian</p>
<p>What is "genius"? "Genius" is a special ability that a person possesses from birth. Through the guidance of parents and teachers, this inherent genius is elicited, and thus a talented person with specialized skills can be produced. Although each person has their own unique genius, there are also those whose genius is buried due to a lack of opportunity. This is the inevitable relationship between "genius" and "environment." This relationship is not that "genius" can transform the "environment," nor that the "environment" can generate "genius"; rather, it is the close relationship between the adaptation of the "environment" and the realization of "genius." To have genius but lack the environment is the same as not having genius at all; if the environment requires a certain genius, but that talent is lacking, the result is also the same as zero – both are lost. For example, Zhan Tianyou, a famous figure in the Qing Dynasty, had the genius to develop China's navy, but the reality was the opposite; the government appointed him to oversee the construction of railways. Although the results were not bad, how much greater would the impact have been if he had followed his natural path! Another example is Yan Fu, a scholar of the Qing Dynasty, who possessed profound knowledge and insightful ideas. According to his genius, he could have reformed China's politics and industry, etc.; however, the reality was the opposite, and he was buried in a literary translation career, only translating many famous European and American works. Although this also brought considerable benefits to China, the effect was worlds apart from directly transforming China. At the same time, Ito Hirobumi of Japan was trusted by the government and transformed the entire Japan, so now it is so strong. This is because it had both "genius" and "environment," both of which were complete, and thus produced a great talent. The country also received great help. From this, we young people should, on the one hand, cultivate our genius based on our own abilities and the paths we are inclined to take; on the other hand, we should also try to expand our genius and become a multi-faceted, specialized technical talent. In school, we should regard all subjects as equally important, and when studying at a high level, choose several of them and devote considerable effort and time to studying and researching them to the best of our ability. In this way, I can boldly say that everyone's genius can adapt to the environment and be very suitable for future needs. Therefore, every young person in school should regard their genius as one of the most precious things in life, and make every effort to develop it in line with the urgent needs of the environment; in this way, we will neither bury our genius nor go against the environment, and thus we can be called promising young people of the future.</p>
<h3>Small Hope</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>In society, nothing succeeds smoothly without setbacks. Success can only be achieved through arduous struggles and constant磨折(challenges), and the success achieved at that time is the most beautiful and precious. Great people tell us this, which makes us know the difficulty of career success, and also gives us courage to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>However, in today's society, most people with a little more experience are always sighing. They not only feel bad about the failure of their careers, but also give some "cold air" to those vigorous new young people, pouring cold water on the young people's hot hearts. They will admonish young people like this..."When we were young, we were just like you, even stronger than you, but what about now! Isn't it still a failure? I advise you, just be content!" This is like a 山海經 (classic of mountains and seas), but it is actually a 殺人經(murdering sutra). It is right to tell young people that career success is difficult, but it is wrong and sinful to sigh and make young people shrink back in the face of difficulties. I hope that this kind of youth leader will stop killing young people with sighs!</p>
<h3>On a Lonely Boat - Dedicated to Friends Who are Hesitating and Wandering</h3>

<p>Friends! Look!</p>
<p>The big ship in front is overturned!</p>
<p>The ship behind is blown over!</p>
<p>How dangerous!</p>
<p>We are in a flat boat.</p>
<p>Hesitating,</p>
<p>Wandering,</p>
<p>Groaning,</p>
<p>Sighing,</p>
<p>It is always disappointment.</p>
<p>Pull yourself together to struggle,</p>

<h3>Eye Expert Dr. Liu Yongjun Benefits the Poor and Sick</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from Dr. Liu Yongjun, an ophthalmologist, which said: "Eyes are important organs for people to see the world and have a great impact on daily life. According to general statistics, 90 percent of people in society suffer from trachoma. If it is not treated quickly, it will spread and cause harm. This doctor, in view of this, feels compassion. I have made a special medicine for trachoma to meet the needs of the society; and I have prepared long-term preferential cards to give to the poor and sick, so that compatriots can get rid of eye diseases and enter the realm of light as soon as possible." Dr. Liu was once an ophthalmologist of the Chinese Medical Association and has set up his own clinic on the second floor of Zhengwei Pharmacy on Carter Road. He has cured many difficult eye diseases and restored sight to the blind. The doctor has rich experience and safe surgery. Many of our colleagues have been treated by him. Preferential cards can be obtained from our newspaper.</p>
<h3>Building Public Bathhouses for the Common People</h3>
<p>— Ye Bochu</p>
<p>Not only in summer, but even at ordinary times, if you can take a bath once a day, it will not only make you feel cool and comfortable, and remove dirt, but also be very beneficial to your health. This is exactly a healthy health care work. Therefore, in this hot and epidemic summer, bathing is almost a daily work for everyone. Speaking of bathing, it requires three conditions: place, equipment, and water. This is very convenient for wealthy families, and they may take a bath several times a day; even middle-class families do not feel it is difficult; however, the most difficult is the class of the lower class and laborers, who work under the scorching sun all day long, sweating profusely, and their bodies are already unbearable. However, a dozen people live in a pigeon-like attic or stove shed, which is already very cramped. Where can there be various bathing facilities and places! And the street beggars are covered with oil and dirt, and lice and fleas are flying around. Some of them even have poisonous sores, pus and blood dripping, and insects and flies gathering. It is really unbearable, and the situation is indescribable!</p>
<p>Therefore, I sincerely ask the wise authorities to set up public bathhouses for the common people so that the common people can have the opportunity to bathe. This may as well rely on the Baojia (neighborhood watch) organization to select a suitable location and set up several bathhouses in each district, equipped with cold water shower heads. A fee can be charged for each bath (the method can imitate public toilets). As for the funding, it can be raised from the public or allocated by the authorities. Fortunately, the time is short, the cost is not much, and the benefits are great, and the merits are immeasurable! At the same time, it is also beneficial in preventing the spread of epidemics.</p>
<h3>Donating Jintan</h3>
<p>Mr. Qiu Renbai wrote to us, saying: "June 13th is the 60th birthday of my late father. I recently received instructions from my mother that at this difficult time, there should be no extravagance. To bless my late father, she instructed me to allocate funds to purchase 1,000 bags of Jintan and distribute 500 bags to your newspaper and the Xinwen Bao respectively. Please distribute them on my behalf." We have received the medicine and will distribute it on your behalf.</p>
<p>Yukon Yixiao, youth Association, Career Night School students, founded Yukon free elementary school, to help out-of-school children. The school has six grades and uses the national textbook as the textbook. In addition to waiving tuition fees, there is no charge for textbooks, exercise books, pencils, etc. The school is now raising funds, and we hope that people from all walks of life will generously donate and support the cause. Donation collection location: Vocational Guidance Department of Sichuan Road Youth Association.</p>
<p>Lost and Found (1) Huangci Foot-powered Car Photo Meeting found on Beijing Road, number 33806. The loser can collect it from Mr. Xiang Fubao, 1030 Jing'an Temple Road. (2) Mr. Qin Zengwei found a square fountain pen with the word "Eduard" on the pen barrel at the east end of the stone road on Fuzhou Road. The loser can come to this office to claim it.</p>
<p>Donations Yesterday, an anonymous person handed in 50 yuan and asked us to forward it to the orphanage for orphans. We have already done so and thank you on their behalf.</p>
