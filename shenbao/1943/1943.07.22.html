<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">論國際戰局與政局 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>夏季戰爭已經踏進慘烈的階段，德蘇戰塲在東錢出現了「血磨團」這驚心動魄的戰鬥，西西里島的爭奪戰也逐漸形成白熱的狀態，而在西南太平洋上，更演出着規模鉅大的消耗戰。在這些軍事的戰鬥後面，又已展開了塲面更宏大的政治的和經濟的戰鬥，其結果對於各戰塲的前途，具有極重犬的意義。從最近各方面的戰鬥情形來看，雖不能說已經到達決戰階段，但這種戰鬥之進行，顯然，對於未來的決戰已經開闢了道路，從目前的戰鬥中，已可看出結局的趨向了。</p>
<p>從軍事方面來看，國際戰局的重心畢竟仍在東綫——德蘇戰塲，酷烈的戰事，正從奥勒爾·庫爾斯克·貝爾格勒特一綫進行，蘇軍　最近一星期間，一再發動反攻，特別是奥勒爾方面的反攻，規模非常浩大，但是，結局至今還很難說。從二年來血戰中，軸心軍已經學得經騐，採取特殊的戰略，特別是所謂「被動攻勢」，和「血磨團戰」，就是針對蘇方拖延決戰期到冬季，及利用「西綫」而避免現時決戰的作戰企圖，軸心軍在東綫造成一種形勢，使蘇軍不得不被動地首先發動攻勢，自己衝入德軍預備好的「血磨」，軸心軍就可「以逸待勞」，利用其新銳武器如虎型坦克等，給蘇軍主力以殲滅性的打擊。因此，今年夏季的東綫，不再有德軍長驅直入的事情而主要的是軸心軍聚殲進攻蘇軍的戰報。這種新戰局的前途，除了雙方戰略的競賽，時間的因素之外，尤取決於後方人力與軍火之充分的接濟，從目前雙方的實情說，經過二年來鉅大消耗之後的蘇聯，顯然處於比較不利的地位。問題在他們還能挨得多少時候，而困難在如不悉其精銳以反攻，軸心軍就會再度衝到莫斯科去。</p>
<p>西西里島的戰事，似乎成爲各方注意的中心，但至今日爲止，尚不能算是眞正的「第二戰綫」，因爲，在實際上，它還未能大量地從東綫吸引軸心軍的兵力。現在軸心國方面，還沒有發動眞性的反攻，也許有人感到奇怪。但是事實也很明顯，第一，在反軸心軍方面，雖然以馬爾泰及班泰雷利亞二島爲根據，集一部份地中海的軍力，向西西里島的南，西，東各平原地區登陸作戰，且揚言將進攻義大利本國，其主要企圖，還在威脅義大利人。如果最大的兵力被吸住在地中海，因此不能在西歐或其他各地登陸，則在反軸心軍的戰略上，顯然是非常嚴重的錯誤，戰爭持久化對於遠隔重洋的進侵者自極不利。軸心軍針對英美此種實情，不能輕移大軍於南錢而墮於敵人聲東擊西之陷阱。所以在西西里，採取的是「誘引戰」，「吸血戰」，但求英美有更多的軍力被吸住，到相當時期加以聚殲。</p>
<p>敵人所謂「反攻」在西南太平洋同時演出，集中龐大的海空軍力自倫巴特島向新喬治亞島企圖登陸，而以國攻蒙達爲其第一期作戰目標。以美海軍爲中心的這種新攻勢，從其運用兵力之龐大及其騷擾作戰區域之廣闊，友邦日本軍事當局絕無絲毫輕敵的心理，從未加以過低的估計。但從全般政略與戰略上觀察，美國之展開西南太平洋攻勢，不是「對日反攻之第一步」，有如敵方的宣傳所騷嚷，實際目的則在於：（一）爲了避免在對歐反攻中受到太平洋方面之新打擊，也就是爲了防制日本對澳洲或共他反軸心軍在東方僅剩的根據地登陸攻擊，所以發動這次防禦性的攻勢；（二）以較大兵力的游擊戰，逐步爭得主動，妄圖實現消耗太平洋上日軍，作未來反攻的準備。針對敵方這種實際的陰謀，友邦在最近數週間展開海空協力的反擊，由於各根據地原有防衛力的鞏固，由於友邦戰略的神速，以逸待勞，業已收獲到反消耗戰的戰果，使敵方海空軍力受到慘重的損失，敵人在東方僅乘的若干根擄地的實力更趨衰弱，他們正在懼怕隨時被進攻的危機。</p>
<p>政治和經濟各方面的戰鬥正在配合軍事新需要而進展，日本德義，近來改裝內部，增强戰力的一切設施，業已到了完成的階段，對外方面，東條首相之再度飛赴南洋各國，緬甸及菲島獨立準備之積極進行，泰國國境問題等之圓滿解決，尤其是以江特拉·鮑斯氏爲中心的印度武裝獨立運動之開展，和對華新政策之全面的實踐，上海公共租界之交還等等，使整個東亞民族更鞏固地團結在日本的周圍，給敵人政治攻勢以最重的打擊。其中印度問題，允引起反軸心國之憂慮，六月十八日以華維爾將軍代林里斯哥爲印度總督，而在印度獨立運動首領被捕週年紀念前夕，近來又有釋放甘地翁以及對印度人民進行懷柔政策之趨勢，回敎同盟，瑪哈特麻及國民大會黨獄外領袖之新活動，都可反映沒落階段英國之惶急，然而，當東亞全局已經改觀之今日，印度人民獨立日期已經迫近，華維爾將軍之爲最後的印督殆已毫無疑問。而東亞這種政治新趨勢，結果必將加深反軸心軍內部的矛盾與瓦解，今後中南美洲各國，愛爾蘭等新消息，必將躍上世界各報，而在中國則「抗戰時營」內部之磨擦，更形成第二次內戰狀態，所有這些新事態，當然更顯明地對軸心國有利的。看吧，羅馬的慘遭轟炸已粉碎了英美對義的神經攻勢，西西里的攻擊戰反使西班牙更堅定，喧傳有動搖趨向的土耳共也默不作聲，義·西·土以及其他中立國已似風雨表那樣預示出國際大局的前途。</p>

<h3 id="c2">孟達密林濕地作戰　日軍發揮特殊優點　美軍毫無進展士氣極爲沮喪　日機襲倫巴特島獲偉大戰績 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據英國標準晚報前給特派員傳，新佐治亞島孟達方面戰况謂，美軍兵力及裝備，雖屬優良，但仍朱能進抵孟達基地口口哩以內地，過去三十六小時中，依然毫無進展，日軍自信對密林作戰殊有　　，此點實爲日軍之長處，美軍欲奪取任何一處陣地，非支付相當代價不　。該方面之作戰，尤使美　精力士氣，大爲消耗，蓋美軍　於奢侈生活，與日軍之簡素生活。迴不相同，故日美兩軍在密林濕地帶之作戰，美軍尤深感無法應付，且其精力與士氣，頗爲沮喪，美軍由陸海空三方　包圍之日軍戰門機，密集該處，協力作戰，入江水美小型發動機船，往來頻繁。美軍雖從遠處以重砲砲擊日軍，然終不敢迫近日軍陣址，美軍雖以飛機艫艇機械裝備等，集中該方面前綫地上，但因地域關係，　不能壓倒日軍美軍彷徨於密林中而死者。已有數千人、在此孟達作戰中，美軍作戰之困難，已較前益形顯著。</p>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　據西太平洋戰綫日軍某基地特派員訉：日軍某轟炸機隊，前於六月三十日，獲悉敵美軍隊基地在倫特巴島登陸後，立即一齊出動，銜破南海之曉空，直冋倫特巴島飛去，當時出現於該成之敵軍，計有運輸艦六艘，驅逐　七艘，陸用舟艇等有　十　，並有巡洋艦及有航空部隊等。以下即爲該次轟炸倫特巴島之詳情、日陸軍機人編隊此次冒惡劣天氣，急　倫特巴島敵軍時，全體戰士均決心澈底殲　敵軍登陸部隊，當飛近目的地時，正是密雲滿佈，正下大雨，在尚未見倫特巴島時，日機某隊長即在思索之中，認不久將抵該島上空，某部隊長亦即定共方向，直指新佐治亞島南方，但仔細一看，忽見倫特巴島已遠落在機之後方，然而此並菲誤認目標，查因某機隊長已知敵機在該島正面等益日機來襲，爲欲襲敵軍背後，故意如此敵空軍從瓜津爾卡納爾島起飛應戰時，適日機編隊飛抵新佐治亞島南方附近，日機隊繼又　向北飛直撲倫特巴島，　北方高空進抵該處上空時，密雲正濃在機上，頗難認淸轟炸目標，在倫特巴海峽敵軍登陸地點，亦因密雲滿佈目標殊不易辨認，但不久陰霾漸散，俯視地下轟炸目標，昭然在目，於是即發現海岸附近有强藥糧穀及其他軍用資材之聚積地二處，是時指揮官逐日下令開始轟炸，於是猛施投彈轟炸敵貸船，一時火燄冲天，指揮機繼又飛抵內江，發　敵登陸舟艇，正在移動中，良機不可失。乃即加以猛炸，將敵舟艇相繼炸沉，正在繼續搜索目的物時，忽在指揮機之左側，發見浮於灣外之敵中型述輸船正發高射射砲，日機一架乃即以該遝輸船爲目標，投下炸彈。彈中該船尾部，常即起火，另一艘受震，帆檣倒塲，在此次空襲中，日機已將敵登陸部隊及貨物舟艇等軍用資材澈底粉碎，而日機則全部安還，雖遇惡劣天氣，仍能獲得空　戰果，於此亦足見日機之英勇作戰之精神</p>

<p>東京二十一日中央社電　敵美七月十八日晨曾以統一式B24型機的二十架，艦上轟炸機的四十架，戰　機的九寸架，合計百五十架以上之强力編隊，來襲波根維爾島布英東北方東十公里之凱勒賓他。所羅門羣島方面之日本海軍戰鬥機隊。當即起飛迎擊，激戰後擊落敵戰鬥機二十七架，艦上轟炸機一架，B24型機一架，合計二十九架，日方損害二架。同時日陸軍高射砲隊亦對之猛射擊落敵B24型轟炸機一架，及阿林哥亞式艦上轟炸機及巨人式戰鬥機各一架，幷創傷B24型轟炸機十二架，日海軍機亦與此相呼應，收極大戰果，又同日夜敵復以空中要塞B17型數架編隊來襲，日軍高射砲隊又　落其中一架云。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日海軍航空部隊於七月十八日曾再度攻擊聖大克魯斯羣島之瓦尼可羅島，該處敵巡洋艦一艘幾被炸中，當時日機並擊落敵機一架。</p>
<p>倍諾斯愛勒二十一日中央社電　據新金山電，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部二十日發表，日戰鬥機轟炸機聯合編隊，曾於十九日轟炸新幾內亞島焙那培那之反軸心軍基地，</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日海軍航空部隊曾於十九日拂曉，猛烈襲擊太平洋中心敵軍基地費匿克斯羣島之千敦島，重創該地敵飛機塲。</p>

<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　希特勒元首與墨索里尼首相會見之消息，迄二十日傍晚德元首大本營發表前，外間毫無所知，故該消息發表後，即政界亦不免一驚，據確悉，希特勒元首於十九日下午，偕軍政幕僚乘機抵義大利北部某市後，墨索里尼首相已先此迎候，二氏旋即開始會談，就軍事上之諸問題，加以檢討。會談歷數小時方終，希特勒元首，即復乘機歸還元首大本　云。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社急電　據德元首總部宣告，希特勒元首與義相墨索里尼昨日在意國北部某鎭會晤，據官方宣告稱：「曾討論軍事問題」。據去此兩軸心國領袖，曾以其本國軍隊總司令之資格，檢討局勢，並權衡時局所需要之措施，而有所協定，此爲義國參戰以來德元首與義相之第五次會見，上次會見，係本年四月七日至十日，在德元首總部舉行。</p>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　關於希特勒墨索里尼兩巨頭會談事，德國各報所揭載者，僅爲總統大本營之簡單發表，茲此間消息靈通方面透露，關於兩氏此次會談之意義如次：（一）此次希特勒總統與墨索里尼首相之會談，當係就來部戰綫蘇軍大攻勢及地中海反軸心登陸作戰而演變之歐洲戰局，加以檢討。各以德義最高統帥之資格，對以上戰局演變之現狀，協議對策，且當已有所決定，此種對策之具有軍事性，已見諸總統大本營之發表，由於地中海戰局之演變及保證軸心軍共同作戰成功之措置，此舉乃屬必然，是否尚含有其他特殊意義，則完全不明。（二）反軸心爲謀打開戰局難關，乃出以反問計。以期離間德義兩國，甚至企圖義國民與法西斯黨分裂，惟義國國民對此則完全置諸不理。反軸心軍之轟炸羅馬以及其他都市，反使義國全體國民抗戰到底之決意益堅。兩氏之此次會見，即爲對反軸心神經戰之絕好囘答。徵諸前例，兩氏此次會談後，軸心軍之努力戰爭，將益形激烈云。</p>

<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　據德國新聞社軍事記者浦雷格那二十日消息，西西里島戰况如次，反軸心軍得到援軍後，其勢益強，現續於西島內部各地進攻，喀大尼亞低地地帶戰車，尤爲激烈。軸心軍抵抗甚力，防衛綫愈益堅固，經喀大尼亞激戰後，反軸心軍已被擊退，是役英軍被毀戰車十九輛。英第八軍曾企圖向喀大尼亞方面進攻，然因德在戰車及俯衝轟炸機之猛烈反擊，英地上部隊　投甚重故不得不停止進攻，等待增援，軸心軍地上部隊與空軍緊密聯絡下，已將喀大尼亞低地西部附近之英軍擊退、是役反軸心軍亦損失　車九輛，値察戰車三輛，又反軸心軍於卡爾塔尼塞塔地區，曾三次進攻，均歸失敗。又駐屯於厄特那山脈西南麓厄那之軸心軍，亦將反軸心軍完全擊退，是役軸心軍一部曾實行迂迥作戰，將反軸心軍集團兜捕殲滅英第八軍於喀大尼亞低地，曾用盡一切力量與方法，實行進攻，但因受軸心軍之奮勇反攻，反軸心軍受損極重，於此局部戰鬥中，軸心軍憑據其有利之陣地，以靠山砲對反軸心軍實行猛烈射擊，又軸心轟炸機於俯衝轟炸機十九日曾猛炸反軸心軍之移動集團及各站聯絡綫，於各山道中，收獲戰果允大，對反軸心船舶之攻擊，亦獲得其大戰果，軸心軍雷擊機隊曾擊沉敵一萬二千噸之大貨船一艘，重創二艘，其地反軸心貨船及運輪船九艘，亦中彈受重傷，在叙拉古斯亦　中大型反軸心軍運輸船二艘，該二船已沉沒或重創，德空軍並曾以機關砲掃射叙拉古斯港及碼頭設施，軸心空軍又於空戰中擊落反軸心機九架，德步兵高射砲隊亦擊落三架。</p>

<p>柏林廿一日中央社電　希特勒總統十九日在義大利北部某市與莫索里尼首相就軍事間題進行重要會談事，德外交當局雖避免發表事實內容，衆料此軸心軍爲適　反軸心軍於西西島上陸後之地中海新情勢，於共同作戰上一緊密連絡之表現也。目前西西里島方面，德方已派遣空軍及最精銳之戈林機械化師團等有力之機械化部隊，並於義本土進駐高射砲部隊坦克車部隊及相當數量之空軍，因反軸心軍開始向殺本土進迫，故德總統決定以德軍一部準備隊派赴義本十。俾德義兩軍　共　對反軸心　實行大反　作戰。據德軍當局宣稱　於西四　島登陸之反軸心軍計十個師團，傳傳並有多數大型坦克車，軸心軍爲對抗敵軍自有加强增援部隊與空軍之必要，萬一反軸心軍將西西里島完全佔據，歐洲要塞之中核將感受威脅則防守義國南部實極重要而困難，故軸心軍當局決忍受一切犧牲。死守該島，現在反軸心軍於喀大尼亞已進至連結卡爾塔尼塞塔阿格利捷特兩地之地帶　此等地區，山嶽綿延進軍極爲因難，敵軍僅由沿隘路前進，故軸心軍實力若能增强至相當程度於該方，則最易實行反擊。德軍當局曾聲稱，西四里島之作戰。尚未終了，今不過爲開始作戰之階段，該作戰不僅爲義軍之戰爭，同時亦爲德軍之戰爭，軸心軍決死守該島云。又反軸心軍轟炸羅馬後，德當局曾謂德軍對此種野蠻行爲，決予以報復，由於此次德義兩巨頭之會談，以上之作戰方針最近當可實現云。</p>

<p>加萊爾在一切地方與麥考萊完全立於對立的地位，他是時代的叛徒。麥考萊雖沒有說英國是天國、樂　地說在向天國進行中。加萊爾雖沒有說英國是地獄，但悲觀地說在向地獄墮落中。麥考萊絕對信任議院，他絕對不信任謹院。他把英國的民主主義看做衆愚政治。因此，他曾有　句說：「雄辯爲銀，沈默爲金。」但我們覺得意外者，主張不寫文軍的僧家却寫了許多的語錄同樣，主張沈默爲金的加萊爾却寫了等身以上的著述。然而矛盾者。文士之常也，可責備者不僅是他一人。他憎惡僞善，憎惡處飾，憎惡傲慢。他的水旨主張坦白。但是他極力宣傳福音、他所最祟拜的英雄，在英國是克朗威爾，在德國是腓力特烈大王。他的文　曾覺佶屈鰲牙，但如他的名著法國革命史」！是否果眞描寫了法國革命的眞相，又作別論！描寫這驚天動地的大活劇，竟使人如身歷其境，實爲之驚歎不置。儘管他有時流露着讚美暴力的語氣，但他的文章所表現的警醒世道人心的力量，却是不能否定的。縱令和他的意見相反者，也當他長他山之石，足資研磨，</p>
<p>詩宗丁尼生與白朗寗</p>
<p>維多利亞朝詩人丁尼生與白期寗的關係，恰如麥考萊和加萊　一樣。在日本自明治十年　二十年的時代，丁尼生所寫的「英國輕騎兵的突擊之歌」一時，由外山正一博士加以　　，與「拔刀　之歌」同爲當時靑年們所傳　的詩。總之，英國自有勅選詩宗以來，大槪從未有像他那樣適合職務的人吧！他的思想緊跟着時代，他的詩調博大昌明。洋洋乎大雅之音。白朗寗之詩則幽奥而深遂，所謂深人淺語，就是指他這種詩，不是給無素養的人看的。具有指導人心之力的一切詩人，自密爾頓以後，除</p>
<h3 id="c10">英國悲劇餘論之四 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— ——德富豬一郎</p>
<p>了華滋華斯以外，不能不推到他。然而與其說他是時代的叛徒倒不如說他是超然維持自己的立塲者，他不　加萊爾那樣，爲了使世人以爲他是消化器病者，遂向世間發出憤世嫉俗，冷潮熱罵的語句，白朗寗惟依其所好而言其志而已。</p>
<p>安諾德的鬼才</p>
<p>我們趁此機會來說一說馬旭。安諾德，他是賴戈別校的校長安諾德博士的長子，其詩才是牛津大學中的傑出奢。他不是可與丁尼生，白朗青相比擬的大詩人。他的詩源恰如深山的岩壁中所滲出的淸泉，不像長江大河那樣一瀉千里。所以他的詩蠹與二者比起來顯見貧弱。然而他苟有所作，其作品責可稱一聲獲得希　詩人的神電。他本身做了一生的督學官，盡瘁於敎育行政上，旣非仙人，亦非隱者。他實是英團風的紳士，具備完美的敎養，儀表，與態度。說他是美貌的俗物大槪是不會錯的。然而他的詩，在精神疲勞者來看來，實是一種靈藥，他的詩，沒有像密爾頓那樣氣魄雄偉。平心而論，他的哲學是知止的哲學。然而詩中流當出他的幽渺的詩思時，却往往使人一誦三歎，詳究其弦外之音。</p>
<p>他在中途棄詩而作散文，他的散文又另有一種風格，極洗鍊之致。他議論政治，議論神學，深入一切問題，他不客氣地指摘英國人的缺點，然而他輕輕地在皮肉上刺了一針時，任何人不會對他拔拳相向。有人說他是現代蕭伯納的前驅者，但安諾特與蕭伯納自有其不同的地方。蕭的譏刺，猶如蜂蟄毫不感得一點毒氣。加萊爾用力的福音宣傳於英國人之間，但安諾德把甜蜜與光明併作一談，誇張英國人的飩重，無骨，自負，功利之點，而警醒物質萬能。他決不是一次二次即覺安心的。他反覆地，慘酷地想到就寫，然而那在實際上對英國人有何實效，則我們不得而知，英國或許已經把他除開。跟着他的死去而一同埋葬了吧。</p>
<h3 id="c11">防禦攻勢的準備　德國方面對於戰局的解釋 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>繼六月卅日以來美軍在四南太平洋所展開的新攻勢之後，在歐洲戰塲上。英美於十日開始四西里島登陸戰，敵方的反攻態勢，漸呈値得注意的活躍氣象。德國對反軸心陣綫攻勢行動　　的見解，大體如次</p>
<p>「歐洲第一」主義的抬頭</p>
<p>先前邱吉爾訪美時，關於英美作戰方向的問題、即「歐洲第一或東亞第一」的問題，舊事重提。結果，邱吉爾的計策無疑地獲得了成功，決定反軸心的先決作戰首先在歐洲戰塲壓倒德義軸心。因此、英美對蘇的態度，日見接近，爲了打倒德義軸心，在歐洲登陸是絕對必要的，且這登陸作戰而形成所謂第二戰綫的時期，應針對束綫德蘇二軍的動態，不遲不早的選擇最適常的時機實施。英美方面希望這時期爲秋冬之交與蘇聯的第三次冬季攻勢的步驟相一致。</p>
<p>但在英美軍看來。在這眞正的歐洲大陸的登陸戰以前，其準備行動首先必須占領軸心軍前哨根據地地中海諸島如西西里島，撒丁島。科西嘉島，以至於克里地島洛特斯島等。這是用空軍轟炸以攪亂巴爾幹，義大利民心的　方基地。同時，爲了確保登陸戰上絕對不可缺的制空權起見，這也是必要的先決條件。</p>
<p>英美登陸迫近決戰</p>
<p>就這情勢看來，一星期前起英美空軍述日向西西里島的集中轟炸，即爲敵方擬在該島登陸的　奏，七月五日德蘇二軍在東部戰綫開始大規模的戰鬥，乘此絕好機會，英美聯合艦隊的主力於六日自直布羅陀出發，十日拂曉，開始西西里島登陸戰。如其西西里被敵占領那就是英美的作戰踏前了一步的意義，此在德義軸心看來是決不能等閑置之的。徒抱樂觀，自然應該絕對避免，那麼，德國方面對此來勢洶海的敵方侵攻態勢，究竟有何對策呢？六月中旬前，軸心方面所持的見解以爲：「敵人欲在大陸登陸是絕對不可能的，我們在地中海有完備的要塞綫。」但這登陸不可能說其性質已漸起變化，例如，從義國的新聞論調來看。「敵人最初的登陸或許成功，但欲永久維持其陣地則極爲困難。」他們的看法，變成了敵人的登陸在緒戰中或能獲得某程度的成功。這變化極堪注目，表示了軸心方面對南方地中　戰綫的根本對策，　國宣傳部長郭培爾更在達斯，來希報上作重要的暗示說：「祇有在攻擊中才有決定戰。而在完全殲　敵人的登陸攻擊軍之中。潛存着重要的結束戰爭之鍵。」</p>
<p>引敵深入加以殲滅</p>
<p>軸心方面毋寗歡迎敵人登陸，容許敵人的登陸獲得某程度的成功，引誘敵軍深入內地，在有利條件下加以攻擊，如其能夠在這裏殲五十萬或一百萬敵軍，那也就是早一　可以結束對英美戰爭的機會。　是德國在戰爭將進入第五年的根水態度。此次東部戰綫的戰事中這種策劃也顯然可是。此即所謂「防禦的　　」。在這塲合，敵如按兵不動，反感困難；敵如躍躍欲試，出以挑戰態度，軸心方面正可大加利用、使其有利於軸心的作戰。</p>
<p>就以上的觀點看來，此次英美的西西里登陸，決非在軸心方面的意料之外，不能說是敵方的巧妙的戰略。早已包括在軸心方面的冷靜的計釗之中、英美在大陸登陸的決戰期，預期將徐趨迫近，歐洲南部戰綫的情勢，將達最緊張的狀態。</p>
<p>太平洋大反攻的烟幕</p>
<p>其次，　　　羅門，新　內亞方面美軍的新攻勢，此方面美國的空軍勢力、雖難以忽視，但其艦隊勢力及陸上兵力，尚不足以開始對日大攻勢，目前美軍的作戰，不過是將來開始大反攻之前的過渡的準備行動而已，爲維持美軍本身的士氣，及爲鼓舞反軸心陣綫內澳洲，重慶，印度等對將來的希望起見，英美的報紙大事宣傳「美國開始太平洋大反攻」，但近一二日來，忽欲修正其過分誇張的空氣頗爲濃厚，報紙上競載美軍登陸部隊的苦戰情　。</p>
<p>例如倫敦泰晤士報對英國國內對美軍的登陸戰期待過殷的樂觀論者發出警告稱：「此次美軍的作戰，乃是想奪取日軍對澳洲大陸的突出陣地；是解除澳洲威脅的一種自衛手段」</p>
<p>英美報紙曾作大言聲稱「美軍的登陸戰必可成功，」他們的在囈，如不予以粉碎，他日將愈來愈在罷，（翔　譯自七月十四日西部朝日新聞柏林特電）</p>

<p>本報本屆助學金，將於下月一日舉行甄別考試，決定助學名額與金額，我們竊願所有考試及格的學生，都得到預定數額的助金。可是，依照申請助學的人數，累計助金數目，與目前積存的數目相較，不敷尚鉅。所以，我們不斷的，迫切的向社會各界呼籲，以期在最短期間內，達到預期目的，完成本屆助學運動，俾萬千優秀學生，繼續安心學業。</p>
<p>在這臨近最後的階段，荷承各界同胞以及友邦人士發揮至高的同情心慷慨　助，使每天助金的積存數目，逐漸接近預期目標，不但每一個待助學生及其家長都注視着這一數目的向上而欣慰，就是我們也因此堅定信念而益加振奮。</p>
<p>我們更以萬分欣慰的心懷，報吿給讀者，昨天承蒙財政部長周佛海先生捐廉二十萬元充本屆助學金。</p>
<p>「苦學記」一節</p>
<p>周氏幼時亦曾苦學，故最能體騐清寒失學之苦衷。第三期古今半月刋曾刋載周先生「苦學記」傳誦一時，他在日留學時的苦况，讀了不禁爲之扼腕，如二次往日時，他說「…向同鄉借了二十元，沿途節食省用的到了東京，這個時候，已是一錢莫名了……距考期只有二星期，名額只有五十名，投考的却有六百多。我那裏會有希望，這三個星期中間，日以繼夜的趕着預備，到了考的那天，我只有半枝鉛筆，向朋友借了一乇錢買一枝新的，並借了一件舊和服穿上。因爲沒有錢坐電車，所以把鉛筆放在衣袖內，緩步徐行的走去。……」這樣的情况，愈是貧困，愈是歷練出眞才實學，周先生在「苦學記」的結論說：「現在，和我當時一樣困苦的靑年，不知道有多少，大家不要灰心，不要餒氣，不要落　，不要絕望！天我絕人之路，一根草有一點露水養的！只要我們肯幹，無論在甚麽情形之下，可以從重重包圍之中，殺開一條血路！」</p>
<p>周先生今日雖處於政府中領導的地位，仍不忘幼年時的苦學，而從中體騐到今天優秀清寒學生失學之苦，乃捐其廉奉，充作助學，我們對此深遠用意，謹代受助學生表示誠懇謝忱，同時，我們在上面摘錄周先生「苦學記」中片段文字，特別盼望受助學生咸以周先生爲模範，而益勵勤苦向學之心，庶不負周先生曁社會各界之期望。</p>
<p>最後，我們謹盼各界源源輸助，共同完成本屆助學金運動。</p>
<p>各界意見</p>
<p>昨接上海綱業　　呂桂叢先生函述對助學意見（一）今後應對習理工學生予以獎勵，並於助學金，考選時注重數理，（二）助學機關聯絡事宜應先由申新兩報入手。則於調查訪問上所耗費之時間人力可省去不少。立意至善，本報自當儘可能期其密切聯絡。又單瀛輝大律師昨以其所得證明費捐充助學金，均堪敬佩。</p>

<h3 id="c29">給被助的靑年們 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— 黃掀世</p>
<p>對社會是有益的事情，確是人人應做，而且人人都負有應做的必然義務和責任。推想到國家的復興，需要的因素，更感到培養人才的迫切。物價又漲得那麽高，眼看着失學的靑年多了起來。這眞是一個太危險的景象。况且你們靑年，是怎樣可寳貴的一個時代，所以助學運動的發起，又該是多麽的需要呢？</p>
<p>本來一個人培養他人的子弟，與培養自己的子弟，可以說絲毫沒有兩樣，而且我們對於助學的希望，又是多麽的遠大。看我國人才素缺，那麽大部份的責任，就是在你們的身上。我們所殷切期望的，唯一也就是在這上面。看歷屆助學的精神是多麽踴躍，這也可說就是象徵了你們的將來。</p>
<p>在過去四屆助學的報吿中，看出了被助學生在成績品性各方面，都夠在水準以上，這一點你們已經給了助學者一個很大的安慰。然而助學者的希　慾。還是很大，你們怎樣才能使他們滿足呢？這就需要你們繼續不斷的努力，苦幹，硬幹下去。一定是不會辜負他們的。而他們所抱的熱忱呢？也與此成正比例。</p>
<p>不過在求學時代的靑年，他們很容易忽略了內心的建設，往往因此蹉跎了他們的學識，因循了他們的前進。要知道學識的進步，是需要內心的鼓勵的在求學的靑年們！你們快快建設起堅強而勵精的內心，把握着學識的猛進，克服困難，更是當然的事情了。所以我又寄語被助的靑年們，你們得認清你們的責任是無限的重大，國家社會是多麽的需要和期待你們，趁寳貴的時時代，建起了你們學識的堡壘，應付時代的需要，去完成你們的責任。</p>

<p>華通杯足球義賽，昨在徐匯球塲舉行第二度接戰，盛况空前。上海難童敎養院爲答謝盛意，特派全班樂隊蒞塲吹奏。競逐結果，前奏曲小型球表演，三省以二比〇奏凱，主力戰則聯誼以三比〇連捷以兩勝不入榮獲華通杯錦標。昨蔣益門君請陸成候君代表給獎，由孟義良受領。惟據悉聖葡方面，因兩次表演均感失當，敗不甘服。故昨晚曾向聯誼提抗戰，以符三　本旨，惟聯誼是否接受，尚在考慮中云。</p>
<p>（前奏）昨賽前奏揷曲小型球表演，三省軍容鼎盛，攻勢共熾，前麽三鋒，哈成一氣，答天雖以驃悍著稱，全程備受威脅。結果張定伯先中紅鵠，三省遙以一球佔先於上半時。易地以後，金麽生依樣葫廬，徐匯受此兩箭，遂吿不治，三省旗開得勝，卒以二比〇高奏凱歌。</p>
<p>（主力）治主力戰聯誼再戰聖葡登塲，觀眾視麽集中，屏息欣賞，勃拉特穿空低射，命中　身，H拽脫遜迎兩急射，顯　撩成角球。勃拉特再度掃射，小劉巧妙接出，危險旣過，聯誼攻勢鼎盛。祺祚兩次捉角，均中門柱，保正迎空。李孫技妙，終於三十分鐘之際，祺祥開出血路，保正轉進中來，李義臣二十碼凌空一脚，終於破綱。一分鐘後，阿李越過兩衛，順流而下，正擬舉足，不意斜落門外，四座爲之頓足。此後聖菊攻勢十分旺盛，劉顯漢活潑身手，東擋西攔，無不如意。前半吿終，聯誼以一球佔先。兩陣再圓，V蘇若邊麽兇射，適切右下角，又爲　漢撥出。聖葡攻勢難盛，並未奏功。而費春華底麽勾轉，孟義良一頂命中。孫若錦迎門力射，又吿破鵠。聯誼兩球連獲，益使聖葡頹喪，故此後反攻雖烈，終無一成，未幾時閒吿終，聯誼遂以三比〇連捷。</p>

<p>最近又有人誤解儲券的發行額，將無限度，風聲所播，以烚赤狂漲爲開路先鋒，百物無不隨以狂漲。在這樣一個無理性的百物狂漲之下，民生苦矣！所以，我們亟盼當局對於儲券發行限度一點，加以剴切的說明，藉以矯正人民懷疑於國家通貨的心理。無疑地，這是當前一個迫切的問題。友邦日本經濟使節　　長小倉正恒氏曾對新聞記者說：「中國財界人士意見中，最重要者，彼等希望設定儲備券之最高發行限度；若此　能獲實現，則中國財界人士可傾全力從事建設中國財政經濟，而所需資金，亦得籌集。」這幾句話，可謂洞若觀火，因爲儲券發行定有限度，則流言不至誤解，亦且不攻自破！</p>

<h3 id="c57">節約運動之我見 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 兪修儒</p>
<p>節約運動在今日已不　一個喊口號空話的時候，而是要脚踏實地切切實實來幹的時候了。所以，這時的講師約，寳是「理所當然」，用不着再拿大道理來詮釋了。</p>
<p>中國近年來，因人民游離，田園荒蕪，交通阻滯，工農凋零，使整個生產力，讓於劇烈的消費弱，一方面特質補艙的困難，一方面又因爲消耗的龐大，於是刺激了物價的瘋狂上漲，在世界賤時國家中恐怕找不到第二個吧？</p>
<p>「節約」之道，在平時固應尋求，在戰時尤其要切實的奉行，我們當知道謂節約，並不是只求减低生活，而尤在使生活趨於合理化。</p>
<p>節約雖然是屬於個人的私德，但其結果實能影響整個的社會，以至國家。一個人能夠實行節約，不但對本身有益，推而廣之，對社會對國家亦將發生良好的影響，我們試看看今日的一般暴發者，因他們的窮奢極侈的生活方式，造成了社會　奢靡淫佚的風氣。刺激着一般社會趨於浮華，往往一衣數千金，一食數千金，這樣物質的浪費旣多，物價的高　就愈速，其結果使大眾的生活愈陷入悲憤的塲地。</p>
<p>我們知道節約兩字，是知之容易而行之　難的事情，節約的範圍又是非常之廣，最切實的就是從個人的日常生活着手實行，所謂日常生活，就是先從衣食方面來做起。</p>
<p>衣的方面，我們也知道現在大多數人穿的都是舊衣，破衣，但我們也可以看到時裝店的「門庭若市」往往一　數千金，甚至數萬金也並不稀奇，大家應儘可能穿舊衣，穿舊鞋非萬不得已時，不添製新裝。同時添製新裝　力求簡單，經濟樸素，提倡穿短衣。在夏季男子，不穿長衫，西服不穿上裝，這樣，即使稍有　洞的衣服，也可繼續穿着，同時也做到「物盡其用」。</p>
<p>食的方面：在一般中產階級以下的人們說來，似乎已到了無可節約的地步，但是我們如再到大酒店大飯店裏去看看的話，那裏正是一食數千金，而且又幾乎家家客滿，這其間過分的消耗，如果加以統計，一定是非常驚人的，我們當知糧食的作用在維持生命的延續，並不在求「山珍海味」，魚肉和蔬菜，同含有豐富的滋養料，一日三餐，祗在求飽　足，必要的　會，亦以指定菜　中最低代價之筵席爲原則。</p>
<h3 id="c58">徐家匯聖母院訪問記（一） <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>成千成萬無依靠的羔羊在修女們熱愛的撫育中</p>
<p>孤女天堂</p>
<p>孤女過着人間最不幸的生活，那裏有什麽天堂呢？然而，從徐家匯電車或公共汽車站，出　絲綱，走行不到十分鐘，就可看到小橋流水人家，一帶白　圍牆，古牌坊式的大門，這裏竟存在着另一天地，是一般男人的禁地，是聖潔的修女和幸福的孤女之家！成百成千的孤女，人人變成「無愁公主」，飽受着愛的陶溶，不解人世的欺詐與罪惡！</p>
<p>拯亡會與聖母院</p>
<p>聖母院，這是中國天主敎拯亡會修女讀書修養之所，她已有近百年的歷史，Helpers　of　the　Holy　Souls（天主敎拯亡會），在西文原是一種　替　人，特別是爲家主亡故的孤寡之家服務的一種組織，在東方，是第四個傳入中國的天主敎修女會，自一八六七年以來，適應中國國情，擴大其服務範圍，對於一切足以爲人帬造福的事業，如濟貧，安老，慈幼，以及積極性的興辦敎育等等，都上　天主愛人之德，辛苦經營。七八十年來，在各省城鎭，都有拯亡會的事工。上　方面，就有這個徐家匯聖母院，一般修女，在出家過獎貞讀經修道之外，依據拯亡會的宗旨，創辦老人院和殘廢院（直到三十年前，才發展成爲今日獨立經營的安老院和普育堂）。她們還創辦了歷史悠久聲譽卓著的崇德和啓明兩婦女校。現在，除了附設徐匯女中（崇德改名，現有初高中女生共約三百餘名）啓明女中（現有高初中女生二百餘名）及　明女中（約有高初中女生五百餘名），以及托兒　·中西施醫所之外·繼續志心經營的，就是創設以來已達七十四年的育嬰堂及其附屬事業。今日徐家匯蒲東路上佔一百餘畝的　幢大厦，就是這個聖母院所經營的啓明徐匯二女中和著名的育嬰堂。</p>
<p>天堂的來歷</p>
<p>徐家匯聖母院育嬰堂的名字，在中下階層是很熟悉的。七十四年以來，收　的孤苦孩童，不下八萬人，特別令人感動的是一二八淞滬戰爭之時，多少人家，流離失所，多少嬰孩，哀啼　左。當時修女們不顧危險，在　火聲光轟射之下，搶救無吿的小生命，每天所收，少則十餘人，多至三十餘人，替國家社會保留的元氣可眞不少。</p>
<p>現在，育嬰堂裏，撫育着的孩童，自襁褓至三歲的，共有一百數十人，四歲至十五歲的，有二百人左右，十五歲以上的，也有八十人。總數約共五百五十人。近來因爲食糧困難，不得已把七歲至九歲的女孩四十名寄着在菉葭浜，一帬異姓的小姊妹們捧着這批寄養出去的姊妹們的照片給記者看，她們自己也爭着來看，那種手足互愛之情，眞令人盛動。三四歲的孩子們，已能囘答記者的詢問，表示她們愛姆姆，愛姊妹們？</p>
<p>嬰孩，大都是貧苦人家自幼送院的，一部份檢自大門口，多數有着嚴重的疾病，或先天不足，然而經過修女們細心調養，死亡是絕無僅有的，她們自哺乳到成人，都由第二慈母修女們撫持將　，到了相當年齡，就施以敎育。授以技藝，視其性之所近，替她們找求出路。每一個孤女進院以後，就須撫養到有自立能力，代其擇婿出嫁之後，才算盡了責任。但是，嫁後生活，仍極關懷，至今院中有不少出嫁後囘來工作，甚至有的帶了女兒囘院共同工作的，聖母院育嬰堂，名符其實地成爲無吿孤女的天堂了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">On the International War and Political Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The summer war has entered a fierce stage. On the Eastern Front of the German-Soviet war, a heart-stopping battle of "bloody attrition" has emerged. The battle for Sicily is gradually becoming intense. In the Southwest Pacific, a large-scale war of attrition is unfolding. Behind these military battles, even grander political and economic battles have begun, and their outcome has great significance for the future of each battlefield. From the recent situation of battles on all fronts, although it cannot be said that the decisive battle stage has been reached, the progress of this kind of battle has clearly paved the way for the future decisive battle. The direction of the ending can already be seen from the current battles.</p>
<p>From a military point of view, the center of gravity of the international war situation is still on the Eastern Front—the German-Soviet battlefield. Fierce battles are taking place along the Orel-Kursk-Belgorod line. The Soviet army has repeatedly launched counter-offensives in the past week, especially the counter-offensive in the Orel area, which is very large in scale. However, the outcome is still difficult to say. From the bloody battles of the past two years, the Axis forces have learned from experience and adopted special strategies, especially the so-called "passive offensive" and "bloody attrition warfare." This is aimed at the Soviet side's attempt to delay the decisive battle until winter and avoid the current decisive battle by using the "Western Front." The Axis forces have created a situation on the Eastern Front, forcing the Soviet army to passively launch an offensive first, rushing into the "bloody attrition mill" prepared by the Germans. The Axis forces can "wait for work" and use their new weapons, such as Tiger tanks, to give the main Soviet forces a devastating blow. Therefore, this summer on the Eastern Front, there will no longer be a long drive by the German army, but mainly reports of the Axis forces annihilating the attacking Soviet army. The future of this new war situation, in addition to the competition between the strategies of both sides and the factor of time, depends especially on the adequate supply of manpower and ammunition from the rear. Judging from the current situation of both sides, the Soviet Union, after two years of huge consumption, is clearly in a relatively unfavorable position. The question is how long they can last, and the difficulty lies in the fact that if they do not use their elite troops to counter-attack, the Axis forces will once again rush to Moscow.</p>
<p>The battle of Sicily seems to have become the focus of attention of all parties, but to this day, it cannot be regarded as a true "second front," because, in reality, it has not been able to draw a large number of Axis forces from the Eastern Front. Now the Axis countries have not launched a real counter-offensive, which may surprise some people. But the fact is also very obvious. First, on the anti-Axis side, although using the two islands of Malta and Pantelleria as bases, they gathered some Mediterranean military forces to land and fight in the southern, western, and eastern plains of Sicily, and claimed that they would attack the Italian mainland. Their main intention is still to threaten the Italians. If the largest military force is absorbed in the Mediterranean, thus making it impossible to land in Western Europe or other places, then it is clearly a very serious mistake in the anti-Axis strategy. The persistence of the war is extremely unfavorable to the invaders who are far across the ocean. In response to this situation of the British and Americans, the Axis forces cannot easily move large forces to the Southern Front and fall into the enemy's trap of making a feint in one direction while attacking in another. Therefore, in Sicily, they are adopting a "lure-in battle" and a "bloodsucking battle," seeking to absorb more British and American military forces, and then annihilate them at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>The enemy's so-called "counter-offensive" is taking place simultaneously in the Southwest Pacific, concentrating huge naval and air forces to attempt to land on New Georgia Island from Rombat Island, with the national attack on Munda as its first operational goal. The military authorities of the friendly nation of Japan have never underestimated this new offensive centered on the US Navy, from the vastness of its deployment of forces and the wide area of its harassment operations, and have never underestimated it. However, from the perspective of overall political and strategic strategy, the United States' launch of an offensive in the Southwest Pacific is not "the first step in a counter-offensive against Japan," as the enemy's propaganda clamors. The actual purpose is: (1) To avoid new attacks from the Pacific in the counter-offensive against Europe, that is, to prevent Japan from landing attacks on Australia or other bases in the East that are only left for the anti-Axis forces, so this defensive offensive was launched; (2) To gradually gain the initiative with larger guerrilla warfare, vainly attempting to realize the depletion of the Japanese army in the Pacific and prepare for future counter-offensives. In response to this actual conspiracy of the enemy, the friendly nation has launched air-sea coordinated counterattacks in recent weeks. Due to the consolidation of the original defense capabilities of each base and the rapid strategy of the friendly nation, waiting for work, it has already harvested the results of the anti-attrition war, causing heavy losses to the enemy's naval and air forces. The strength of the enemy's remaining bases in the East is weakening, and they are fearing the crisis of being attacked at any time.</p>
<p>Political and economic battles are progressing in coordination with new military needs. Japan, Germany, and Italy have recently completed all facilities for internal restructuring and enhancement of combat power. Externally, Prime Minister Tojo's re-flying to various countries in Southeast Asia, the active progress of independence preparations in Myanmar and the Philippines, the satisfactory resolution of the Thai border issue, especially the development of the Indian armed independence movement centered on Chandra Bose, and the comprehensive practice of the new policy towards China, the return of the Shanghai Public Concession, etc., have made the entire East Asian nation more consolidated in uniting around Japan, giving the enemy's political offensive the heaviest blow. Among them, the Indian issue is allowed to cause the anti-Axis countries to worry. On June 18, General Wavell replaced Linlithgow as the Governor-General of India, and on the eve of the anniversary of the arrest of the leader of the Indian independence movement, there has recently been a tendency to release Gandhi and to pursue a policy of appeasement towards the Indian people. The new activities of the Muslim League, Mahatma, and the leaders of the Congress Party outside prison can all reflect the panic of Britain in its declining stage. However, now that the overall situation in East Asia has changed, the date of independence for the Indian people is approaching, and it is almost certain that General Wavell will be the last Governor-General of India. And this new political trend in East Asia will inevitably deepen the internal contradictions and disintegration of the anti-Axis forces. In the future, new news from countries in Central and South America, Ireland, etc., will surely appear in newspapers around the world, and in China, the friction within the "War of Resistance Base" has formed a second civil war. All these new situations are of course more obviously beneficial to the Axis countries. Look, the tragic bombing of Rome has shattered the British and American nerve offensive against Italy, the attack on Sicily has made Spain more determined, and Turkey, which was rumored to have a tendency to waver, has also remained silent. Italy, Spain, Turkey, and other neutral countries have seemed like barometers, foreshadowing the future of the international situation.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a report from the special correspondent of the British Standard Evening News on the battle situation in Munda, New Georgia Island, although U.S. troops have superior strength and equipment, they still cannot advance to within a mile of the Munda base. There has been no progress in the past 36 hours. The Japanese army is confident in its jungle warfare skills, which is indeed its strength. The U.S. military must pay a considerable price to seize any position. Operations in this area are particularly exhausting for the U.S. military's energy and morale. The U.S. military is accustomed to luxurious living, which is different from the simple living of the Japanese army. Therefore, the U.S. military feels particularly unable to cope with operations in the jungle and wetland areas, and their energy and morale are quite depressed. The Japanese fighters, surrounded by U.S. forces from the land, sea, and air, are densely packed in the area and cooperate in combat. Small motorized boats carrying river water are frequently moving back and forth. Although the U.S. military uses heavy artillery to bombard the Japanese army from a distance, they still dare not approach the Japanese army's positions. Although the U.S. military has concentrated aircraft, landing craft, and mechanical equipment on the front lines in the area, due to geographical reasons, it cannot overwhelm the Japanese army. Thousands of U.S. soldiers have died wandering in the jungle. In this Munda operation, the difficulties faced by the U.S. military have become more apparent than before.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a dispatch from a special correspondent at a Japanese military base on the West Pacific front: A Japanese bomber squadron learned on June 30 that enemy U.S. troops had landed on Rombat Island. They immediately took off together, piercing the dawn sky of the South Sea, and flew directly to Rombat Island. At that time, the enemy forces appearing on the scene included six transport ships, seven destroyers, and more than ten landing craft, as well as cruisers and aviation units. The following are the details of the bombing of Rombat Island. The Japanese army's airmen resolutely annihilated the enemy landing force during this urgent raid on the enemy forces on Rombat Island, braving the adverse weather conditions. When approaching the destination, it was filled with dense clouds, and it was raining heavily. Before seeing Rombat Island, a Japanese pilot was thinking that he would soon reach the airspace over the island, and a commander also set the direction straight to the south of New Georgia Island. However, upon closer inspection, Rombat Island was found far behind the plane. However, this was not a misidentification of the target. It was found that a pilot knew that enemy planes were waiting on the front of the island for a Japanese air raid. In order to attack the enemy forces from behind, he deliberately did this. When the enemy air force took off from Guadalcanal to respond, the Japanese formation flew to the vicinity of the south of New Georgia Island. The Japanese squadron then flew north, straight to Rombat Island. When it approached the airspace at the northern high altitude, the dense clouds were thick, making it difficult to clearly identify the bombing target on the plane. The enemy's landing point in the Rombat Strait was also difficult to identify due to the dense clouds. However, the haze soon dissipated, and the bombing target was clearly visible when looking down on the ground. Then, two places where strong drugs, grain, and other military supplies were accumulated were found near the coast. At this time, the commander ordered the bombing to begin, and then the enemy cargo ships were bombed with fierce bombing, and flames soared into the sky. The command plane then flew to the inland river and found enemy landing craft moving. This was a good opportunity. He immediately bombed them fiercely, sinking the enemy landing craft one after another. While continuing to search for the target, he suddenly discovered an enemy medium-sized transport ship floating outside the bay on the left side of the command plane, firing high-altitude cannons. A Japanese plane then took the transport ship as its target and dropped bombs. The bomb hit the stern of the ship, which immediately caught fire. Another ship was shocked, and its masts collapsed. In this air raid, the Japanese planes completely crushed the enemy landing forces, goods, landing craft, and other military supplies. All the Japanese planes returned safely. Even in adverse weather conditions, they were still able to achieve air combat results, which also shows the brave fighting spirit of the Japanese planes.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - On the morning of July 18, the enemy US sent a strong formation of over 150 planes, including twenty unified B24-type planes, forty carrier-based bombers, and ninety fighters, to attack Kerebintha, ten kilometers northeast of Buin, Bougainville Island. The Japanese naval fighter squadron in the Solomon Islands immediately took off to intercept them. After fierce fighting, they shot down twenty-seven enemy fighters, one carrier-based bomber, and one B24-type plane, for a total of twenty-nine planes. The Japanese side suffered losses of two planes. At the same time, the Japanese army's anti-aircraft artillery also fiercely fired on them, shooting down one enemy B24-type bomber, one Arlingoya-type carrier-based bomber, and one Giant-type fighter, and damaging twelve B24-type bombers. The Japanese naval aircraft also responded to this, achieving great results.

<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - Until the German Führer's headquarters released the news of the meeting between Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini on the evening of the 20th, there was no knowledge of it, so the news inevitably surprised the political world. According to reliable sources, Führer Hitler arrived at a city in northern Italy by plane in the afternoon of the 19th, accompanied by military and political staff. Prime Minister Mussolini had already been waiting for him. The two men immediately began talks, examining military issues. The talks lasted for several hours before they ended. Führer Hitler then returned to the Führer's headquarters by plane.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency urgent telegram) - According to a statement from the German Führer's headquarters, Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met in a town in northern Italy yesterday. According to an official statement, "Military issues were discussed." It is reported that the leaders of the two Axis countries, in their capacity as commanders-in-chief of their national armies, reviewed the situation and weighed the measures required by the situation, and reached an agreement. This is the fifth meeting between the German Führer and the Italian Prime Minister since Italy entered the war. The last meeting was held at the German Führer's headquarters from April 7 to 10 this year.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - Regarding the meeting between the two giants Hitler and Mussolini, the German newspapers only published the simple announcement of the President's Headquarters. Here, well-informed sources revealed the significance of this meeting as follows: (1) The meeting between President Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini was to review the European war situation that has evolved due to the large-scale offensive by the Soviet army on the Eastern Front and the anti-Axis landing operations in the Mediterranean. In their capacity as the supreme commanders of Germany and Italy, they discussed countermeasures to the current state of the above war situation and have decided on them. The military nature of these countermeasures has been seen in the announcement of the President's Headquarters. Due to the evolution of the Mediterranean war situation and measures to ensure the success of the Axis forces' joint operations, this move is inevitable. Whether there are any other special meanings is completely unknown. (2) In order to break through the difficult situation of the war, the anti-Axis forces have come up with a counter-questioning plan in order to alienate Germany and Italy, and even attempt to split the Italian people and the Fascist Party, but the Italian people completely ignore this. The bombing of Rome and other cities by the anti-Axis forces has only strengthened the determination of the entire Italian people to fight to the end. The meeting between the two men is an excellent answer to the anti-Axis nerve war. Judging from previous examples, after this meeting between the two men, the Axis forces' efforts in the war will become more intense.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Fierce Battle Unfolds on the Sicilian Front <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a message from German News Agency military reporter Pregner on the 20th, the war situation in Sicily is as follows: The anti-Axis forces have become stronger after receiving reinforcements, and are now continuing to attack in various parts of the interior of the island. The tank battles in the Catania lowlands are particularly fierce. The Axis forces are resisting strongly, and the defense line is becoming more and more solid. After the fierce battle of Catania, the anti-Axis forces have been repelled. In this battle, 19 British tanks were destroyed. The British Eighth Army attempted to attack towards Catania, but due to the fierce counterattack by German tanks and dive bombers, the British ground forces suffered heavy casualties and had to stop the attack and wait for reinforcements. Under the close coordination of the Axis ground forces and air force, the British forces near the western Catania lowlands have been repelled. In this battle, the anti-Axis forces also lost nine tanks and three scout tanks. The anti-Axis forces launched three attacks in the Caltanissetta area, but all failed. The Axis forces stationed in Enna, on the southwest foothills of Mount Etna, also completely repelled the anti-Axis forces. In this battle, part of the Axis forces carried out a roundabout operation, encircling and annihilating the anti-Axis forces. The British Eighth Army used all its strength and methods in the Catania lowlands to carry out an attack, but due to the Axis forces' brave counterattack, the anti-Axis forces suffered heavy losses. In this local battle, the Axis forces, relying on their favorable positions, used mountain artillery to fiercely fire on the anti-Axis forces. On the 19th, Axis bombers and dive bombers fiercely bombed the anti-Axis forces' mobile groups and communication lines, achieving great results in the mountain roads. Attacks on anti-Axis ships also achieved great results. The Axis torpedo plane squadron sank one large enemy freighter of 12,000 tons and heavily damaged two. Nine other anti-Axis cargo ships and transport ships were also hit and seriously injured. In Syracuse, two large anti-Axis transport ships were also hit. The two ships have sunk or been heavily damaged. The German Air Force also strafed the port and wharf facilities of Syracuse with machine guns. The Axis Air Force also shot down nine anti-Axis aircraft in air battles. The German infantry anti-aircraft artillery also shot down three aircraft.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Germany Dispatches Elite Divisions to Station on the Italian Mainland; Preparing to Launch a Major Counter-Offensive Against the Anti-Axis Forces <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - Although German diplomatic authorities are avoiding releasing the factual content of President Hitler's important meeting with Prime Minister Mussolini in a northern Italian city on the 19th regarding military issues, it is generally expected that this is an expression of close cooperation between the Axis forces in joint operations to adapt to the new Mediterranean situation after the anti-Axis forces landed in Sicily. Currently, in the Sicily area, the German side has dispatched powerful mechanized units such as the Air Force and the most elite Göring Mechanized Division, and stationed anti-aircraft artillery units, tank units, and a considerable number of air forces on the Italian mainland. Because the anti-Axis forces have begun to advance towards the mainland, the German President has decided to send a part of the German army as a reserve team to Italy to allow the German and Italian armies to jointly carry out a major counter-offensive against the anti-Axis forces. According to German military authorities, the anti-Axis forces that landed on Sicily consist of ten divisions, and it is reported that there are also a large number of large tanks. In order to counter the enemy forces, the Axis forces naturally need to strengthen their reinforcements and air force. If the anti-Axis forces completely occupy Sicily, the core of the European fortress will be threatened, and it is extremely important and difficult to defend southern Italy, so the Axis authorities are determined to endure all sacrifices and defend the island to the death. Currently, the anti-Axis forces have advanced to the area connecting Caltanissetta and Agrigento in Catania. In these areas, the mountains are continuous and the advance is extremely difficult. The enemy forces can only advance along the narrow roads, so if the Axis forces can increase their strength to a considerable extent in that area, it will be easiest to carry out a counterattack. German military authorities have stated that the battle of Sicily has not ended. It is only the stage of starting the battle. This battle is not only a war for the Italian army, but also a war for the German army. The Axis forces are determined to defend the island to the death. Also, after the anti-Axis forces bombed Rome, the German authorities said that the German army would retaliate against this barbaric act. Due to the recent meeting between the two German and Italian giants, the above-mentioned operational policy can be realized recently.</p>
<h3 id="e9">English Literature and the Rise and Fall of England (2) – Carlyle, the Traitor of the Era <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Carlyle stood in complete opposition to Macaulay in every way; he was the traitor of the era. While Macaulay didn't say England was heaven or a paradise, he did say it was progressing toward heaven. Carlyle didn't say England was hell, but pessimistically said it was falling into hell. Macaulay absolutely trusted Parliament; he absolutely distrusted the institution. He viewed English democracy as ochlocracy. Therefore, he once said, "Eloquence is silver, silence is gold." But what we find surprising is that just as a monk who advocates not writing scripture writes many sayings, Carlyle, who advocated silence is golden, wrote more than his weight in writings. However, such contradictions are common among literati, and he is not the only one to blame. He hated hypocrisy, hated pretense, and hated arrogance. His main aim was to advocate frankness. But he vigorously preached the gospel. The heroes he most admired were Cromwell in England and Frederick the Great in Germany. His writing style was once considered awkward and difficult, but his famous work, "The French Revolution,"! Whether it truly depicts the reality of the French Revolution is another matter! The depiction of this earth-shattering grand drama is so immersive that it leaves people in awe. Despite the fact that he sometimes reveals a tone of praising violence, the power of his articles to awaken the world and people's hearts is undeniable. Even those who disagree with him should consider him as a whetstone from another mountain, worthy of polishing themselves.</p>
<p>Tennyson and Browning, the Poetry Masters</p>
<p>The relationship between Victorian poets Tennyson and Browning is just like that of Macaulay and Carlyle. In Japan, from the Meiji 10s to the 20s, Tennyson's "The Charge of the Light Brigade" was temporarily translated by Dr. Masaichi Toyama, and together with "The Song of the Sword," it was spread and sung among young people at that time. In short, since England had the post of Poet Laureate, there had probably never been someone as suitable for the position as he was! His thinking closely followed the times, and his poetry was broad, magnificent, and clear. It was a grand and elegant sound. Browning's poetry, on the other hand, was profound and recondite. The so-called "deep thoughts in plain words" refers to his kind of poetry, which is not for the uncultured. Among all the poets with the power to guide people's hearts, since Milton, besides</p>

<p>— Tokutomi Iichiro</p>
<p>Wordsworth, he cannot be left out. However, rather than saying he was a traitor of the era, it would be better to say that he superciliously maintained his own position. He didn't, like Carlyle, issue cynical and sarcastic statements to make the world think he had digestive problems. Browning only spoke his mind according to his preferences.</p>
<p>Arnold's Genius</p>
<p>Let us take this opportunity to talk about Matthew Arnold. He was the eldest son of Dr. Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby School, and his poetic talent was outstanding among those at Oxford University. He was not a great poet comparable to Tennyson and Browning. The source of his poetry was like a clear spring seeping from a cliff in the deep mountains, not like the Yangtze River flowing thousands of miles. Therefore, his poetry seemed weak compared to the other two. However, if he made something, his work was commendable and worthy of being called a blessing from the spirit of Greek poets. He worked as an inspector for his entire life, devoting himself to educational administration. He was neither an immortal nor a recluse. He was truly an English gentleman, possessing perfect education, appearance, and attitude. It would probably not be wrong to say that he was a beautiful philistine. However, his poetry is a spiritual medicine for those who are mentally exhausted. His poetry doesn't have the magnificent aura of Milton. Frankly speaking, his philosophy is a philosophy of knowing when to stop. However, when his faint poetic thoughts flow out in his poems, they often make people sigh and carefully study the hidden meaning.</p>
<p>He abandoned poetry midway and wrote prose. His prose has another style, extremely refined. He discussed politics, discussed theology, and delved into all issues. He impolitely pointed out the shortcomings of the English people, but when he lightly pricked their skin, no one would raise their fists against him. Some say he was the precursor to modern George Bernard Shaw, but Arnold and Shaw have their differences. Shaw's mockery is like a bee sting, without any poison. Carlyle vigorously preached the gospel among the English people, but Arnold talked about sweetness and light together, exaggerating the dullness, spinelessness, conceit, and utilitarianism of the English people, and warning against the omnipotence of materialism. He was definitely not content with just one or two times. He repeatedly and cruelly thought about it and wrote, but we don't know what practical effect that had on the English people. England may have already removed him, burying him along with his death.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Preparations for a Defensive Offensive – Germany's Interpretation of the War Situation <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Following the new offensive launched by the American military in the South Pacific since June 30th, on the European battlefield, the Anglo-American landing operation on Sicily began on the 10th, and the enemy's counter-offensive posture is gradually showing noteworthy signs of activity. Germany's views on the Allied offensive operations are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The Rise of the "Europe First" Doctrine</p>
<p>Previously, when Churchill visited the United States, the issue of the Anglo-American war direction, namely the issue of "Europe first or East Asia first," was brought up again. As a result, Churchill's strategy undoubtedly succeeded, and it was decided that the Allied forces would first overwhelm the German-Italian Axis on the European battlefield. Therefore, the Anglo-American attitude towards the Soviet Union has become increasingly close. In order to defeat the German-Italian Axis, a landing in Europe is absolutely necessary, and the timing of this landing operation to form the so-called Second Front should be selected at the most opportune time, neither too early nor too late, based on the movements of the German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front. The Anglo-American side hopes that this period will coincide with the autumn-winter transition and the steps of the Soviet Union's third winter offensive.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the Anglo-American military, prior to this genuine landing operation on the European continent, their preparatory actions must first occupy the Axis's outpost bases in the Mediterranean Sea, such as Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and even Crete and Rhodes. This is a way to disrupt the morale of the Balkans and Italy through aerial bombardment. At the same time, it is also a necessary prerequisite in order to secure air supremacy, which is absolutely indispensable for a landing operation.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Landing Approaching Decisive Battle</p>
<p>Looking at this situation, the concentrated bombing of Sicily by the Anglo-American air force, which began a week ago, is a prelude to the enemy's planned landing on the island. On July 5th, the German and Soviet armies began large-scale battles on the Eastern Front. Taking advantage of this excellent opportunity, the main force of the Anglo-American joint fleet departed from Gibraltar on the 6th, and at dawn on the 10th, the landing operation on Sicily began. If Sicily is occupied by the enemy, it will mean that the Anglo-American operation has taken a step forward, which the German-Italian Axis cannot afford to take lightly. One should naturally avoid complacency. So, what countermeasures does Germany have against this menacing enemy invasion? Before mid-June, the Axis's view was that "It is absolutely impossible for the enemy to land on the continent. We have complete fortification lines in the Mediterranean." But this impossibility is gradually changing in nature. For example, judging from the Italian news, "The enemy's initial landing may succeed, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain their position permanently." Their view has changed to the enemy's landing being able to achieve a certain degree of success in the initial battles. This change is extremely noteworthy, indicating the Axis's fundamental countermeasures for the southern Mediterranean front. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels even made an important hint in the "Das Reich" newspaper, saying: "Only in attack can there be a decision. And within the complete annihilation of the enemy's landing attacking force lies an important key to ending the war."</p>
<p>Luring the Enemy Deep and Annihilating Them</p>
<p>The Axis would rather welcome the enemy's landing, allowing the enemy's landing to achieve a certain degree of success, luring the enemy army deep inland, and attacking them under favorable conditions. If they can annihilate 500,000 or 1 million enemy troops here, that would be an opportunity to end the war against Britain and the United States sooner. This is Germany's fundamental attitude as the war enters its fifth year. This kind of plan is also evident in the battles on the Eastern Front this time. This is the so-called "defensive offensive." In this situation, if the enemy remains stationary, it will be difficult to react; if the enemy is eager to try and issues a challenge, the Axis can take full advantage of it, making it favorable to the Axis's operations.</p>
<p>From the above point of view, the Anglo-American landing on Sicily this time was by no means beyond the Axis's expectations, and cannot be said to be a clever enemy strategy. It has long been included in the Axis's calm calculations. The decisive battle for the Anglo-American landing on the continent is expected to approach gradually, and the situation on the southern European front will reach its most tense state.</p>
<p>Smoke Screen for the Great Pacific Counter-offensive</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the new American offensives in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, although the American air power in this area cannot be ignored, its fleet strength and land forces are not yet sufficient to begin a major offensive against Japan. The current American operations are merely a transitional preparatory action before the start of a major counter-offensive in the future. In order to maintain the morale of the American military itself and to encourage the hopes of Australia, Chongqing, India, and other countries in the Allied camp for the future, the British and American newspapers have been heavily promoting "America's Great Pacific Counter-offensive," but in the past day or two, there has been a strong desire to correct its exaggerated atmosphere. Newspapers are competing to report on the hard battles of the American landing forces.</p>
<p>For example, the London Times warned the British domestic optimists who had excessive expectations for the American landing operation: "The American military operation this time is to seize the Japanese army's protruding positions against the Australian continent; it is a self-defense measure to relieve the threat to Australia."</p>
<p>British and American newspapers had made grand pronouncements claiming "The American military's landing operation will definitely succeed." If their ravings are not crushed, they will become increasingly rampant in the future. (Translated by Xiang from Berlin Special Telegram of the July 14th Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) At the closing ceremony of the first session of the New Life Movement's summer training camp for civil servants and youth corps members, the leader's instructions were roughly as follows: Today, the first session of the New Life Movement's summer training camp for civil servants and youth corps members is holding its closing ceremony. Those trained in the camp are all civil servants at the recommended level and outstanding leaders and members of the youth corps. The government places great expectations on this. Now that the training is completed, you are leaving the camp to serve in government agencies or to work hard in schools. I would like to offer two points as parting words: First, cherish and constantly uphold the spirit of the training period. Your determination to revive China and defend East Asia must be even more steadfast. Not only must you strengthen yourselves, but you must also spread this to your colleagues and classmates. Second, you must firmly remember the founding father's teaching that knowing is difficult, but doing is easy. While seeking knowledge, you must also strive to practice. Saving China and protecting East Asia, the most important thing is not just knowing, but especially doing. We must obtain true knowledge from practice. Finally, I wish you all good health and that you will strive to complete the task of saving China and protecting East Asia, firmly believe, endure hardship, and move forward bravely.</p>

The start and end times will be based on the signals issued by the Air Defense Command.

<p>Yesterday, a Shanghai News Agency reporter learned from the Rice and Grain Joint Operations Office that large quantities of rice are being shipped to Shanghai daily from rice-producing areas such as Yangzhou, Suzhou, Changshu, Wuhu, Songjiang, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou. The total amount is estimated to be around 15,000 tons. The person in charge of the office stated that 70-80% of the rice arriving in Shanghai is high-quality white rice, with some indica rice, broken rice, and brown rice. The Joint Operations Office has been working extremely hard recently, as the rice arriving in Shanghai, especially brown rice and indica rice, must be milled by hired laborers before it can be sold for daily consumption.</p>
<p>Household Flour Available for Sale Today</p>
<p>The 42nd installment of household flour is scheduled to begin selling today and will end on the 30th. Rice shops will sell the flour based on the 42nd joint ticket of the flour certificate. At that time, the rice shop with the registration number noted on the joint ticket will exchange each joint ticket for one catty of No. 2 flour, priced at 6.2 yuan. The deadline for the 41st installment of household rice is today, but the price and quantity of the 42nd installment of household rice have not yet been announced.</p>
<p>The Most Stocked Animal Feed is Bran</p>
<p>The stockpiles of various miscellaneous grains, such as soybeans, red beans, mung beans, broad beans, corn, peanuts, red sorghum, rapeseed, bran, wheat, and barley, are gradually increasing. Their market prices have risen slightly compared to a month ago. It is understood that bran is the most stocked, followed by corn and red sorghum. However, the number of people eating these grains has also increased recently.</p>
<p>Insect Pests Exterminated in Chuansha Farmland</p>
<p>At a time when the people of this city are extremely concerned about food, and the early rice crop is about to be harvested, insect pests were suddenly discovered in the farmland in the Xiaopu Township area of Chuansha, gnawing on the rice stalks and affecting the farmland. After receiving the report, the Municipal Grain Bureau immediately supervised the district office to quickly eradicate the pests using scientific methods. Fortunately, with the unanimous and active promotion of the farmers, the pests were completely eradicated, and the rice fields in the district were secured.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Taiwan Sugar Arrives <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The fifth installment of household sugar in both concessions was widely sold yesterday. Each person with a fifth-installment sugar purchase certificate could obtain half a catty of white sugar.

Each ticket (i.e., each half catty) was still sold for 2.4 yuan, with a deadline at the end of this month. A Shanghai News Agency reporter learned from the sugar industry yesterday that the amount of sugar registered before the war has decreased.

<h3 id="e28">Mr. Zhou Fo Hai Aids Students; Donates 200,000 Yuan; The Widely Circulated "Diary of Hardship" <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The scholarship fund of this newspaper will hold an eligibility examination on the first of next month, to determine the number of scholarships and amounts. We secretly hope that all students who pass the examination will receive the predetermined amount of aid. However, according to the number of people applying for aid, the total amount of aid is much greater than the amount currently accumulated. Therefore, we are constantly and urgently appealing to all sectors of society, hoping to achieve our intended goal in the shortest possible time, complete this year's scholarship campaign, and allow thousands of outstanding students to continue their studies with peace of mind.</p>
<p>In this final stage, we are grateful to the compatriots of all circles and friends for their highest sympathy and generous assistance, which has brought the accumulated amount of aid money closer to the expected goal day by day. Not only are every student awaiting help and their parents watching this number increase with joy, but we are also strengthened in our beliefs and become more invigorated.</p>
<p>We are even more pleased to report to our readers that yesterday we received a donation of 200,000 yuan from Finance Minister Zhou Fo Hai as this year's scholarship fund.</p>
<p>A Section from "Diary of Hardship"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou also studied hard in his youth, so he can best understand the plight of poor students who have dropped out of school. The third issue of the "Gu Jin Half-Monthly" published Mr. Zhou's "Diary of Hardship," which was widely circulated. The hardships he endured while studying in Japan could not help but make people clench their fists in sympathy. For example, on one of his trips to Japan, he said, "...I borrowed 20 yuan from a fellow villager, and after saving on food and expenses along the way, I arrived in Tokyo. At this time, I had no money left... There were only two weeks until the exam, and there were only 50 places, but more than 600 people applied. How could I have any hope? During these three weeks, I prepared day and night. On the day of the exam, I only had half a pencil. I borrowed a dollar from a friend to buy a new one, and borrowed an old kimono to wear. Because I didn't have money for the streetcar, I put the pencil in my sleeve and walked slowly... " Such a situation, the poorer it is, the more true talent and practical knowledge is cultivated. Mr. Zhou said in the conclusion of his "Diary of Hardship": "Now, I don't know how many young people are as poor as I was then. Don't be discouraged, don't be discouraged, don't fall behind, don't despair! Heaven never blocks people's paths. Even a blade of grass has a drop of dew to nourish it! As long as we are willing to work hard, we can break through the encirclement, no matter what the situation!"</p>
<p>Although Mr. Zhou is now in a leading position in the government, he has not forgotten the hard work of his youth, and from it, he has understood the plight of outstanding poor students who have dropped out of school today. Therefore, he has donated his salary to be used as scholarships. We would like to express our sincere thanks on behalf of the aided students for this profound intention. At the same time, we have extracted a fragment of Mr. Zhou's "Diary of Hardship" above, especially hoping that the aided students will take Mr. Zhou as a model, and even more encourage their diligent and hard work in learning, so as not to live up to the expectations of Mr. Zhou and all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Finally, we sincerely hope that all sectors will continue to provide assistance and jointly complete this year's scholarship campaign.</p>
<p>Opinions from All Sectors</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Lü Guicong of the Shanghai Gangye Corporation, stating his views on scholarships: (1) In the future, students studying engineering should be rewarded, and attention should be paid to mathematics and physics when selecting scholarship candidates. (2) The Shin and Shen newspapers should be the first to be involved in coordinating scholarship organizations. This will save a lot of time and manpower spent on investigation and visits. The intention is excellent, and this newspaper will do its best to closely coordinate. Also, Attorney Shan Yinghui donated his income from certification fees to the scholarship fund yesterday, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Donation of Tuition Waivers</p>
<p>The Yuying Private Middle School on Route Doumer came with a letter, in order to respond to this newspaper's scholarship campaign, instructing that if there are students in the first and second grades of junior and senior high school who have passed the eligibility examination and are willing to study at the school, they should be recommended to the school, and they will be exempted from the registration fee. After passing the test, they will be admitted to the school free of charge.</p>
<p>Shen Bao's Scholarship Fund for this Session Exceeds One Million</p>
<p>This newspaper's scholarship fund has been enthusiastically donated by all sectors of society, and it has become increasingly enthusiastic in recent days. As of yesterday, it has exceeded one million yuan. The list of donors and amounts received yesterday is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Fo Hai: 200,000 yuan, Lü Guicong: 5,000 yuan, Tang Chengbo, Wang Xuenong, Zhu Degao, Attorney Shan Yinghui (income from certification fees): 1,000 yuan each,</p>

<h3 id="e29">To the Aided Youth <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Xuan Shi</p>
<p>Doing things that are beneficial to society is something that everyone should do, and everyone has an inevitable obligation and responsibility to do it. Thinking about the revitalization of the country, the factors needed, I feel the urgency of cultivating talents even more. Prices have risen so high again that there are more and more young people dropping out of school. This is truly a dangerous sight. Moreover, you young people, what a precious era this is, so the launch of the scholarship movement should be so necessary?</p>
<p>Originally, nurturing other people's children is no different from nurturing one's own children, and our hopes for scholarships are so great. Seeing that our country lacks talent, the majority of the responsibility lies on your shoulders. What we earnestly expect is only this. Seeing how enthusiastic the spirit of previous scholarship campaigns has been, it can be said that this symbolizes your future.</p>
<p>In the reports of the past four scholarship campaigns, it can be seen that the aided students have been above average in terms of academic performance and character. This has already given the scholarship providers a great comfort. However, the scholarship providers' desires are still very great. How can you satisfy them? This requires you to continue to work hard, work hard, and work hard. You will definitely not disappoint them. And their enthusiasm is also proportional to this.</p>
<p>However, young people in the academic era, they easily overlook the construction of their inner selves, and often delay their knowledge and follow their progress. Know that the progress of knowledge requires inner encouragement! Young people who are studying! You must quickly build up a strong and energetic inner self, seize the rapid progress of knowledge, and overcome difficulties, of course. So I also send a message to the aided youth, you must recognize that your responsibility is infinitely great, the country and society are so in need and expecting you, take advantage of the precious era, build up your fortress of knowledge, meet the needs of the times, and fulfill your responsibilities.</p>

<p>First, Mr. Yuan Ludeng of the presidium reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying that he was very grateful to all members for attending.

Although the colleagues have worked hard during this trial period, it is quite difficult to purchase materials. The colleagues are not discouraged and are still working hard to break through the difficulties. If it goes smoothly in the future and reaches a satisfactory goal, it is not only the expectation of all members, but also the expectation of himself. If it cannot reach a satisfactory goal due to the facts and the environment, it will also start and end well, so that the members will not suffer any losses.

<p>The Shanghai Vagrant Xi Qin Institute, run by the World Red Swastika Society, has successively collected vagrants sent from all sides, totaling 488 people. Now, the Public Concession Board of Works has successively sent 160 vagrants. After inspection, 37 people were found to have syphilis, lung disease, or to be addicted to opium. A total of 123 people were actually received, for a total of 611 people received. Mr. Qi Shou Kang, the director of the institute, uses the institute's gardens to select and assign vagrants to work in shifts every day. In more than a month, the area of ​​land that has been reclaimed is about ten acres. Soybeans and various vegetables have been planted, and after they mature, the minimum harvest can be used for vagrants to supplement their meals. The broken tiles and rubble in the institute are picked, checked, and transported by the heads of each district, supervising the vagrants every day. On one hand, workers with masonry and carpentry skills are selected from the vagrants to let them learn from the workers and repair the walls, and use the remaining bricks to build tables and benches in the dining hall, which are really beautiful. In addition, as the weather is getting hotter, in order to maintain health, he has negotiated with Dr. Li Bangzheng, the director of the Health Group Committee of the Executive Committee, to arrange six large isolation rooms, which can accommodate 20 beds. The equipment in the room is simple and clean. In addition, vagrants with medical experience are selected to serve as nurses, and all promotions are still orderly.</p>

<p>The various distribution offices of the two rubber factories, Da Zhonghua and Zhengtai, in this city, previously restricted the purchase of rain boots on rainy days and the purchase of sneakers on sunny days, and limited buyers to have a housing donation ticket, citizen certificate, and a pair of old rain boots or sneakers to exchange for a pair, and also stipulated the time for buying shoes. They did this because the raw materials allocated by the authorities for manufacturing were insufficient, in order to prevent reselling for profit. Recently, it has been learned from the industry that Da Zhonghua's distribution offices have removed the restrictions on selling rain boots on rainy days and sneakers on sunny days in response to current needs. They have been selling them every morning in recent weeks. The old shoe exchange, donation ticket, and citizen certificate methods are still the same, but the number of shoes sold is limited every day.</p>

<p>The second round of the Hua Tong Cup charity football match was held yesterday at the Xuhui Stadium, with unprecedented enthusiasm. The Shanghai Orphanage sent its entire band to the stadium to play in gratitude for the support. As a result of the competition, in the prelude small-ball performance, the Three Provinces team won two to zero, while in the main match, Lianyi won three to zero, achieving two consecutive victories and winning the Hua Tong Cup championship. Yesterday, Mr. Jiang Yimen invited Mr. Lu Chenghou to present the award on his behalf, which was received by Meng Yiliang. However, it is understood that the Saint Portuguese side felt that both performances were improper and were unwilling to accept defeat. Therefore, last night they proposed a rematch to Lianyi to align with the spirit of the three principles, but whether Lianyi will accept is still under consideration.</p>
<p>(Prelude) In the prelude to yesterday's match, the small-ball performance featured the Three Provinces team in full force, with a fierce attack. The three forwards worked together seamlessly. Although Da Tian was known for his bravery, he was constantly under threat. As a result, Zhang Dingbo scored first, giving the Three Provinces team a one-goal lead in the first half. After switching sides, Jin Mosheng replicated the feat, and Xuhui succumbed to these two goals, leading the Three Provinces team to a triumphant victory with a score of two to zero.</p>
<p>(Main Match) In the main match, Lianyi and Saint Portuguese took to the field again, attracting a concentrated audience who watched with bated breath. Brat made a low shot that pierced the air, hitting the defender. H. Hutchinson met two rapid shots, skillfully turning them into corner kicks. Brat shot again, but Xiao Liu cleverly intercepted it. With the danger averted, Lianyi launched a strong attack. Qi Zuo hit the goalposts twice, while Bao Zheng made a header. Li Sun showed his skill, finally, after thirty minutes, Qi Xiang opened the scoring, Bao Zheng moved forward, and Li Yichen scored with a volley from twenty yards. A minute later, A Li bypassed two defenders and charged down the field, but as he was about to shoot, he missed the goal, causing a collective groan from the spectators. After this, the Saint Portuguese attack became very strong, but Liu Xianhan's agile performance blocked every attempt. At the end of the first half, Lianyi led by one goal. In the second half, V. Su Ruo made a fierce shot from the wing, aiming for the lower right corner, but was again saved by Liu Xianhan. The Saint Portuguese attack was strong but ineffective. Fei Chunhua then hooked the ball from the baseline, and Meng Yiliang headed it in. Sun Ruojin followed with a powerful shot, scoring again. Lianyi's two consecutive goals further demoralized the Saint Portuguese team, so although their counterattacks were fierce, they were ultimately unsuccessful. Soon after, the match ended, and Lianyi won three to zero.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Misunderstandings and Rumors <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The entire Shanghai market seems to be built on water, constantly fluctuating. Whenever there is a rumor, it stirs up waves, plunging the entire market into a state of uncertainty.</p>
<p>We know that the reason why prices cannot be stabilized is that everyone is rushing to purchase and hoard goods. We also know that the reason why everyone is rushing to purchase goods is that people are doubtful about the value of the Reserve Certificates. These are all the results of misunderstandings and rumors. After the cessation of the issuance of Hua Zhong and Hua Nan military scrip on April 1st of this year, some people misunderstood that the circulating amount of Reserve Certificates would increase sharply. Some people even misunderstood that after the military scrip was naturally withdrawn, the Reserve Certificates would lose the support of the military scrip. Because of this misunderstanding, the trend of purchasing and hoarding goods spread throughout the Shanghai market. Subsequently, the Chinese and Japanese authorities clarified the policy of fully maintaining the value of Reserve Certificates, and this misunderstanding gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>Recently, some people have misunderstood that the issuance amount of Reserve Certificates will be unlimited. The rumors have been spread, with skyrocketing prices as the pioneer, and everything has risen wildly along with it. Under such an irrational surge in prices, the people are suffering! Therefore, we urgently hope that the authorities will provide a clear explanation regarding the issuance limit of Reserve Certificates, so as to correct the people's doubts about the national currency. Undoubtedly, this is an urgent issue at present. Mr. Ogura Masatsune, head of the Japanese economic delegation, once told reporters: "Among the opinions of Chinese financial figures, the most important is that they hope to set a maximum issuance limit for Reserve Certificates. If this can be achieved, Chinese financial figures can devote all their efforts to building China's financial economy, and the necessary funds can also be raised." These words can be described as insightful, because if the issuance of Reserve Certificates is limited, rumors will not be misunderstood, and they will be dispelled without being attacked!</p>
<h3 id="e48">Wheat Collection, Distribution, and Transfer: Registration and Certification by the Flour and Wheat Committee <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Council has decided on a unified purchase plan for the new wheat crop this year. In addition to submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval, the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee is specifically tasked with handling it in accordance with the plan. The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has established branch offices in the main producing areas of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces since the 15th of last month to register the qualifications of flour mills, wheat shops, wheat vendors, and commission agents. The registration ended on the 20th, and a batch of new wheat has been shipped from the interior to Shanghai. However, many people are unclear about the procedures for transporting wheat into Shanghai. The reporter has learned from the Commercial Control Council that wheat is a material that is stipulated to be collected and distributed in a unified manner, which is different from the situation of transporting ordinary materials. It only needs to be registered and stamped by the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, without the need for certification by the Grain Trade Association and the Federation, so as to avoid time-consuming procedures and hinder progress. However, the Grain Trade Association and the Federation can still maintain close contact with the Professional Committee and consult at any time in order to understand the wheat collection, distribution, and transfer situation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks suddenly fell sharply amidst firm voices. This was a reaction that should have occurred after rising wildly for eleven days since the start of the rally on the 8th of this month, excluding Sundays. The industry suppressed the rally, and both new and old investors were already satiated with high positions. As a result, selling pressure surged, and the squeeze-out was fierce. Most stocks showed a one-sided downward trend, but there were also exceptions. For example, the Commercial Press in the cultural industry retraced after seeing a new high price, but eventually squeezed up again. Zhonghua retraced by a small amount, while World firmly stood at its original price. Some small-denomination stocks also diverged. Da Zhonghua Weaving rose by more than one yuan, and Hongsheng followed suit. China Clock Factory remained strong. Zhongxing Wood Industry suddenly rose. China Investment also rose by nearly one yuan. The department store industry was also the hardest hit by the decline. Wing On and Sincere both saw a wild retreat, while the National Goods Company went against the trend and rose, due to increased capital injection and insufficient supply. Dasheng No. 1, No. 3 factories, Rongfeng, Xinhe fell a lot. Tongfeng, Xinfeng, Guoxin, etc. were bought up after the decline. Among the new pharmaceutical industry, Zhongfa and Xinya both retraced. Xinyi fell more drastically. Among the public utilities, Zhabei Water and Electricity fell. Afterwards, the afternoon was already firm. China Electric fell more drastically. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Da Zhonghua Match each fell more. Jiu'an Industrial retreated. The transaction prices of Lianhua and Qin Nie Real Estate have all retraced. Kangyuan Can also fell. The new stock of Fumin Dairy Products rose by 50% in transaction price. Today, Dahua Yuzhi (par value 20 yuan) will also be launched.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Dyeing Associations have noted that one of the reasons for the recent rise in prices of all kinds of goods is the hoarding and manipulation by non-industry people. In addition, the authorities of various associations have recently found that non-industry people have mixed into the associations and engaged in black market trading. This situation not only promotes price volatility, but also easily disrupts the order of the associations. Therefore, each association stipulates that from now on, members must wear badges when entering the association for trading in order to identify them and strictly prohibit non-industry people from mixing in. Each association also advises members to abide by the association's articles of association and not engage in illegal transactions, so as to avoid being punished by the authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e57">My Views on the Thrift Movement <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xiuru</p>
<p>The thrift movement is no longer just a time to shout slogans and talk nonsense, but a time to do things practically and realistically. Therefore, lecturers at this time are "taken for granted" and do not need to interpret them with great principles.</p>
<p>In recent years, China's people have been displaced, fields have been barren, transportation has been blocked, and industry and agriculture have declined, causing the overall productivity to be weaker than consumption. On the one hand, it is difficult to replenish special products, and on the other hand, because of the huge consumption, it has stimulated the crazy rise in prices. I am afraid that no other country in the world will be found in this situation?</p>
<p>The way of "thrift" should be sought in peacetime, and especially practiced in wartime. We should know that thrift is not only to reduce living, but also to make living more rational.</p>
<p>Although thrift belongs to personal private virtue, its results can affect the entire society and even the country. A person who can practice thrift is not only beneficial to himself, but also has a good impact on the society and the country. Let us look at the general nouveau riche today. Their extravagant lifestyle has created a social atmosphere of extravagance and debauchery. Stimulating the general society to tend to be frivolous, often a piece of clothing costs thousands of dollars, and a meal costs thousands of dollars. The more waste of materials there is, the faster the price rises, and the result is that the lives of the masses are more and more in a tragic situation.</p>
<p>We know that the word thrift is easy to know but difficult to do. The scope of thrift is also very broad. The most practical thing is to start from personal daily life, so-called daily life, that is, to start from clothing and food.</p>
<p>In terms of clothing, we also know that most people now wear old clothes and broken clothes, but we can also see that fashion stores are "crowded", often costing thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars. Everyone should wear old clothes as much as possible, and wear old shoes. When it is absolutely necessary, do not make new clothes. At the same time, making new clothes should be as simple, economical and simple as possible, and advocate wearing short clothes. In summer, men do not wear long gowns, and suits do not wear tops. In this way, even if there are slightly damaged clothes, they can continue to be worn, and at the same time, "make the best use of things".</p>
<p>In terms of food: For people below the general middle class, it seems that there is nothing to save, but if we go to large hotels and restaurants, we will find that a meal costs thousands of dollars, and almost every family is full. The excessive consumption in this period, if counted, must be very amazing. We should know that the function of food is to maintain the continuation of life, not to seek "delicacies from mountains and seas". Fish, meat and vegetables contain rich nutrients. Three meals a day are only for satiety, and the necessary gatherings are based on the principle of the lowest price banquet in the designated menu.</p>
<h3 id="e58">A Visit to the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Convent (1) <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Tens of thousands of helpless lambs are nurtured with love by the nuns.</p>
<p>Orphan's Paradise</p>
<p>Orphans live the most unfortunate lives in the world. Where is paradise? However, from the Xujiahui tram or bus stop, leaving Sicang, walking for less than ten minutes, you can see a small bridge, flowing water, and houses, with a white wall, and an archway-style gate. This place actually exists another world, is a forbidden area for ordinary men, is the home of holy nuns and happy orphans! Hundreds of thousands of orphans have all become "Princesses without Sorrow", who are deeply immersed in love and do not understand the deception and evil of the world!</p>
<p>The Helpers of the Holy Souls and the Sacred Heart Convent</p>
<p>The Sacred Heart Convent is a place for Chinese Catholic Helpers of the Holy Souls sisters to study and cultivate themselves. It has a history of nearly a hundred years. Helpers of the Holy Souls, in Western languages, is an organization that serves people, especially for orphans and widows whose family heads have passed away. In the East, it is the fourth Catholic nun association to be introduced to China. Since 1867, adapting to China's national conditions, it has expanded its scope of services. For all undertakings that can benefit the people, such as poverty relief, elderly care, childcare, and actively running education, all of them are based on the virtues of God's love for people and working hard. In the past 70 or 80 years, the Helpers of the Holy Souls have had their work in the provincial cities and towns. In terms of this, there is the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Convent. In addition to being a nun, reciting scriptures and practicing the Tao, in accordance with the purpose of the Helpers of the Holy Souls, they founded nursing homes and disability homes (until 30 years ago, they developed into the current independently operated nursing homes and Puyu Hall). They also founded the Chongde and Qiming women's schools, which have a long history and excellent reputation. Now, in addition to the Xuhui Girls' Middle School (renamed Chongde, with about 300 female students in junior and senior high schools), Qiming Girls' Middle School (with more than 200 female students in senior and junior high schools) and Ming Girls' Middle School (with about 500 female students in senior and junior high schools), as well as daycare centers and Chinese and Western clinics, the one that continues to be run with wholehearted devotion is the nursery that has been established for 74 years and its affiliated businesses. Today, the buildings on more than 100 mu of land on Pudong Road in Xujiahui are the Qiming Xuhui No. 2 Girls' Middle School and the famous nursery run by the Sacred Heart Convent.</p>
<p>The Origin of Paradise</p>
<p>The name of the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Convent Nursery is very familiar to the lower middle class. In the past 74 years, no less than 80,000 orphaned and distressed children have been taken in. What is particularly moving is that during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, many families were displaced and many babies were crying helplessly. At that time, the nuns risked danger and rescued the helpless little lives under the sound of gunfire and bombardment. They rescued more than a dozen people every day, and as many as 30 people, which saved a lot of vitality for the country and society.</p>
<p>Now, in the nursery, there are a total of one hundred and several dozen children from infancy to three years old, about 200 children from four to fifteen years old, and 80 children over fifteen years old. The total number is about 550 people. Recently, because of food difficulties, they had to send 40 girls aged seven to nine to Lu Jia Bang. A group of small sisters with different surnames showed the reporter photos of these sisters who were sent to foster care. They also scrambled to see them. The affection of mutual love between siblings is really moving. The three- and four-year-old children can already answer the reporter's questions, expressing that they love Mumu and their sisters?</p>
<p>Most of the babies are sent to the hospital by poor families from an early age. Some are found at the gate, and most of them have serious illnesses or congenital deficiencies. However, after the nuns' careful care, deaths are rare. From breastfeeding to adulthood, they are taken care of by the second mother, the nuns. When they reach a certain age, they are given education. They are taught skills, and they are found a way out according to their nature. After each orphan enters the hospital, they must be raised until they have the ability to be independent, and they are only considered to have fulfilled their responsibility after selecting a husband for them to marry. However, they are still very concerned about their lives after marriage. To this day, there are many who have returned to work after marriage, and some have even brought their daughters back to the hospital to work together. The Sacred Heart Convent Nursery has truly become a paradise for helpless orphans.</p>
