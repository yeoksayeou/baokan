<h3 id="c1">收買棉紗棉布 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨天最高國防會議臨時會議議決收買棉紗棉布實施要綱及暫行條例，內容是實施依法收買棉紗棉布，目的是取締囤積，抑半物價。我們相信，全國人民對於政府這一賢明措施，除本身是國積者以外，莫不表示衷心的欣慰與感動。所以欣慰與感動的原因，很簡單的就是希望國積罪惡將從此漸見消滅，希望物價畸形將從此合理抑平，希望人民生活將從此得到安定。滿城風雨的物價問題，將以這一適切措施為轉捩而樹立合理調　的基礎，怎不令人興奮與感動呢？</p>
<p>我們會經不憚煩　，不辭率直，為了愛護政府，為了改善民生，對於調整物價，不斷的作種種呼籲。在四個月以前，我們曾以「請求政府下決心取締投機囤積」為題，痛陳所見，其後政府頒令澈查，我們益增擁護信念，雖然當時因故停滯，我們還是不避嫌疑，連續獻言。現在政府已經公布「收買棉紗棉布實施要綱及暫行條例」，即日實施，我們更願與全國人民竭誠擁護這一措施的切實執行，貫澈到底，更進而擴展至其他民生日用品方面。</p>
<p>關於公布之實施要綱與暫行條例，既經最高國防會議愼重討論決定，我們不必率爾評述。不過，對於這一措施引起各方面　關擊，願先申述管見如次：</p>
<p>最値得大家　　的，也就是最値大衆安心的，就是棉紗棉布收買以後的處置問題，業經主席剴切聲明：「收買中外商民之棉紗棉布，政府當以維護民生，增加生產為主旨，訂定合理的配給辦法，妥籌支配，除業巳決定之對外貿易，及各地物資交換之計劃外，極力用於國內民生需要，以期復興經濟」。大衆對此應有深切認識，絕對信賴主席的諾言，靜待逐步實施。</p>
<p>其次値得大衆注意的，就是友邦日本方面，亦採同樣措置，對於我國積極協助，在華日本商民所有之棉紗棉布，亦照此原則辦理。我們對於友邦日本這種協力態度，足以加强收買工作的效率，不但可以避免取巧掩飾之途徑，同時，可塞悠悠之口。這裏，竭誠盼望日木當局與在華商民，着眼於協力大東亞戰爭勝利之遠見，不吝局部利益，充分給予協力與尊重中國法令，使這一工作圓滿完成。同時，我們接受友邦協力之餘，益須自肅自勵，嚴格執行，絕對重法，庶不負友邦協力之雅意。</p>
<p>對於執有棉紗棉布之商民同胞，我們願意誠摯的向你們進一言，從今天起大家不再以國積者的眼光對你們怒向，今天已是你們應該淸醒恢復理智的時候了。每個人都是國家社會的構成分子，大衆都有利益，然後個人利益才能保持，縱使財產累累，決計不能脫離人羣社會而孤立起來，唯顧私利的「明哲保身」是靠不住的。現在政府實施收買，是為了大衆的利益，那末，你們究竟是少數人的利益，不得不犧牲。盼望你們不再迷於私利，深自覺悟必然之趨勢，對於政府法令不但絕無違背掩避的餘地，必須坦然擁護。古人云：「以前種種醫如咋日死，以後種種譬如今日生。」不必打算財產數字上的位數。况目，政府所定收買價格，已經顧到日前事買，並不算低。如果依照生產成本，也許有過之無不及，因為這種圍存紗布，大多數遠在二三年前之存貨，並非最近期內所生產，絕對不能與目前不合理之黑市價相衡。</p>
<p>紗布之外，人民日常生活必需品，在上海之儲積量，也必不少，政府在整個抑平物價施策之下，全面調整，自為極可能的事。於此，我們盼望其他生活必需品囤戶，應當劍及履及，不作永遠富翁的甜夢，先自出範。其次，準備新囤戶的，尤其應睜開眼睛，不再作　自縛，我們必須認識大量囤積攫利，固然絕路，即少數囤積防荒防漲，結果也是「蜻蜓吃尾，自吃自」，同是絕路。大家瞭然，各不國貨，那末，物資供求正常，物價自然趨平了。</p>
<p>政府這次措施，我們固然謁誠擁護，可是，從頒行法令以至獲得成效，其間距離不邇，需要怎樣的切實執行？怎樣的嚴格依法？才可順利達成，這是大衆最熱烈的期待。</p>
<p>最後，我們深感安定民生已在政府努力籌劃，如果上下一致，協力以進，那末，民生固然得到安定，而政府地位也必然得到强化。棉紗棉布誠然為民生必需，而糧食一項，實尤為重要，盼望政府於不久將來，在紗布收買以外，對於民食也予切實調節。譬如本市這一期的戶口米，數量雖仍舊，而時間却延長，不免使大衆愁眉，在租界甫經接收，當局對此民食，應竭力設法由維持而增益，振奮大衆心理。言無不盡，順便論及。</p>

<p>柏林九日中央社電　據海通社訊，德意志新聞軍事訪員今日著論申稱：硏究目前戰局者，必須有一基本認織，此即陸地戰與水陸雙棲戰之分別是也。所謂水陸雙棲戰者，英美在西西里所作之攻勢以及尙將在地中海所從事之戰術是也。德國乃歐陸首强，惟有陸地戰始能加以擊敗，今日差足以與德國陸車相周旋者，其惟蘇聯乎。蘇聯陸軍之力量及經騐，雖司雄視全世界，然而對於德軍尙不能作決然之勝利，然則以英國第入軍為主幹之英美陸軍，欲成就蘇聯軍隊之所不能，是不啻緣木求魚問道於，也。以四四里　局勢而曾，英美聯軍雖能於地中海島　實施雙棲戰略，但價一期深入，不在海軍砲隊掩體之下，則英美陸軍將被迫與舉世最堅强之勁旅交綏，其經騐實力，朱必不相形見拙喧乎其後云。</p>

<p>— 吉田政治</p>
<p>物資移動頻繁</p>
<p>更感到特務者，在上海或南京的市中，各種物資豐富得出於意外。上面曾說過甫京路的夜景，各種商品到處在市內移動或被貯藏起來。如其推測被秘密國積着的商品，則物資的絕對量可說極為豐富。踏遍上海和南京的各市街角落，似平絕對找不出有窮迫至於餓死的人們。而在上海的極司非而路郊外及南京的中山門外，肩荷祖販之羣，携來了各種蔬菜，糧食，菓實等物。於是引誘這些羣衆的各種各類商品，極豐富地在陳列在商店內。無論任何商店，絕無為了購買商品而排成的行列。這種狀態，從外表看來，無論如何不能算是物資不足的伏態。物資不足的狀態，或許潛存於更深的底流中而不為人們所覺察，因為許多的指導階級的人們異口同聲地高唱增强生產的必要。</p>
<p>物價與通貨</p>
<p>然則從本年一月以來，尤以四月以後的物價之急激的　貴，其原因果在於通貨方面嗎？通貨量普通與物價有最密切的關係，因有此說。因儲備券的發行類到何程度未經公布，故一般人推斷已達相當大的數量、那是錯了。何況上海市塲上的利息，遠較去年為高，銀行存欽據銀錢業公會的發表顯見减少，僅及中國事變前的三十幾分之一。而且存款的百之九十如以上為活期存款，定期性存款不足百分之卞。如此，儘管金融極寒，物價更趨騰貴，所以一定要徒通貨數量的一點來判斷物價，殊為適當。</p>
<p>那麼從民衆對於通貨本身上的信頼之一點上，能夠得出物價昻騰的原因嗎？筆者所見，未必盡然。儲備券今已在華中廣泛的地域內普遍地流通授受，其流通之廣大迅速，可說是一種警奇的現象。如此看來，從通貸方面來發見並把握物價　貴的原因，不能不說也是很困難的。</p>
<p>現在的上海物價，大體比中國事變前高七十倍至一百倍。乘人力車五分鐘，須付十元。糕餅一塊需三元至五元。這種高物價的現象，究竟由何原因而致的呢？今後動向又將如何呢？筆者決不完全贊成悲觀　及憂慮說、其詳細情形，這裏暫不置論。至其要點，在於華中物坐　貴的原因並不存在於單純的經濟原則。</p>
<p>經濟原則以外</p>
<p>綜上所述，最近中價經濟界之　態的現象，尤以物價的　貴，其原因不能不求之於經濟原則以外。經濟原則以外的原因，乃是民衆的心理作用。支配民衆心理最强大的力量是　中國民衆對世界戰局的觀測，　敵方所策動的陰謀的經濟謀略之效率二者。所以我們可以下結論說：在目前的中國『經濟問題的核心，唯有在大東亞戰爭的勝利上才能覓獲。其他各種應付方策，祇應該沿此大方針實施。當實施個別的，局部的、經　的施策時，應充分洞察事態的真相、並應審慎警戒，使我方的諸種經濟政策絕無可供英美渝的陰謀覷隙以乘的餘地。（完）（翔：　自七月三十一日西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>周毓產投機　「論地產投機」</p>
<p>社會福利部駐泥辦事處處　周毓英氏，昨（九日）應中華民族反英美協會之邀，於晚九時半、假座本市上海　　電合廣播，題為「論地產投機。」茲節錄如左：</p>
<p>上樓的地產投機先是操之於洋人之手，上海一般市民、為了住房子的問題，早有不勝色担之勞，事變發生以後的四五年間，一因治安關係，地產無人背受，二因可囤的物資甚多，地產不　藏匿，因此地產投機的現象，可說停止了不幸最近這一年問，上海秩序平定、投　目標减少，游資積集太多，地產的投機活動、又死　復燃了。現在的地　投機，第一種為擁有雄厚資力者，策二種為稍有資力的地皮　客。第三種為豪無資力之「地皮鬼」專為房主出主意，設立空頭地產公司，政府當局如不速謀取締·敘濱辦法，房屋斜紛，將擾亂整個的上海，所以我說，上海如不及草實行「平均地權」的政策，挽教投機性的地產制度，那末許多的地產糾紛，或致釀成激烈的地產革命吧。</p>

<p>民廿五年春，日不見玉訪華經續使節團的收獲，為上海日商銀行團之協助法幣政策，交出存銀易為法幣，惜後以西安事變之故，不能為更進一步的兩國經濟合作。今年七月日本第二次派造氏問防華經濟使節團，以小倉正但氏為團長，以石明昭男氏。爾鄉三郞氏，小寺遭咨氏等為團員，其訪問的收獲雖尙未見　事實、但由四氏返國後的會論額之。似亦可以約略推知一二。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Supreme National Defense Council's temporary meeting resolved to implement the essential guidelines and interim regulations for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. The purpose is to crack down on hoarding and suppress prices. We believe that all the people of the country, except for those who are hoarders themselves, will express sincere joy and emotion at this wise measure of the government. The reason for this joy and emotion is simple: it is hoped that the evils of hoarding will gradually be eliminated, that the abnormal prices will be reasonably suppressed, and that people's lives will be stabilized. The issue of prices, which has been the talk of the town, will take this appropriate measure as a turning point and establish a foundation for reasonable adjustment, how can it not be exciting and moving?</p>
<p>We have never been afraid of trouble, nor have we hesitated to be frank. For the sake of loving the government and improving people's livelihoods, we have continuously made various appeals for adjusting prices. Four months ago, we published an article entitled "Requesting the Government to Resolve to Crack Down on Speculation and Hoarding," in which we stated our views. Afterwards, the government issued an order to investigate thoroughly, and we increased our belief in support. Although it was stalled at the time for some reason, we still did not avoid suspicion and continued to offer advice. Now that the government has announced the "Essential Guidelines and Interim Regulations for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth" and implemented them immediately, we are even more willing to sincerely support the effective implementation of this measure with the people of the country, carry it through to the end, and further expand it to other daily necessities.</p>
<p>Regarding the published essential guidelines and interim regulations, since they have been carefully discussed and decided by the Supreme National Defense Council, we do not need to rashly comment on them. However, regarding the concerns raised by all parties about this measure, we would like to first state our humble opinion as follows:</p>
<p>What is most worthy of everyone's attention, and what is most reassuring to the public, is the issue of the disposal of cotton yarn and cloth after the purchase. The Chairman has earnestly stated: "The government should take the maintenance of people's livelihood and the increase of production as the main purpose in purchasing cotton yarn and cloth from Chinese and foreign merchants. It should formulate reasonable allocation methods and properly plan the distribution. In addition to the already determined foreign trade and the exchange of materials in various places, it should strive to use it for domestic people's livelihood needs in order to revive the economy." The public should have a deep understanding of this, absolutely trust the Chairman's promise, and wait patiently for gradual implementation.</p>
<p>Secondly, what deserves the attention of the public is that our friendly nation, Japan, has also adopted the same measures and is actively assisting our country. All cotton yarn and cloth owned by Japanese merchants in China will also be handled according to this principle. We believe that this cooperative attitude of our friendly nation Japan will strengthen the efficiency of the purchase work. It can not only avoid the path of taking advantage of loopholes, but also silence the critics. Here, we sincerely hope that the Japanese authorities and merchants in China will focus on the long-term vision of cooperating for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and will not hesitate to sacrifice local interests, and fully give cooperation and respect to Chinese laws, so that this work can be successfully completed. At the same time, while we accept the assistance of friendly nations, we must also be self-disciplined and strictly implement the law, so as not to fail the kindness of friendly nations.</p>
<p>To our fellow merchants who hold cotton yarn and cloth, we would like to sincerely offer a word: from today onwards, everyone will no longer look at you with the eyes of hoarders. Today is the time when you should wake up and restore your reason. Everyone is a constituent of the country and society. Only when the public has interests can individual interests be maintained. Even if you have a lot of wealth, you cannot isolate yourself from the crowd and society. The "wise men who protect themselves" who only care about their own interests are unreliable. Now that the government is implementing purchases for the benefit of the public, then your interests, which are only those of a few, must be sacrificed. We hope that you will no longer be obsessed with private interests, and deeply realize the inevitable trend. Not only is there no room for violating or evading government laws and regulations, but you must openly support them. The ancients said: "All the past is as dead as yesterday, and all the future is as born as today." Don't bother calculating the digits of your assets. Moreover, the purchase price set by the government has already taken into account the previous purchases and is not considered low. If it is based on the cost of production, it may be even higher, because most of these hoarded yarns and fabrics are inventory from two or three years ago, not produced recently, and absolutely cannot be compared with the current unreasonable black market price.</p>
<p>In addition to yarn and cloth, the amount of daily necessities stored in Shanghai must also be considerable. Under the government's overall price suppression policy, a comprehensive adjustment is very likely. At this point, we hope that the hoarders of other daily necessities should act promptly, not dream of being a rich man forever, and set an example themselves. Secondly, those who are preparing to become new hoarders should especially open their eyes and no longer tie themselves up. We must realize that hoarding and profiting in large quantities is certainly a dead end, and even a small amount of hoarding to prevent famine and price increases will eventually be "a dragonfly eating its tail, eating itself," which is also a dead end. Everyone understands that if everyone does not hoard goods, then the supply and demand of materials will be normal, and prices will naturally tend to be stable.</p>
<p>We sincerely support this measure of the government. However, from the promulgation of the law to the achievement of results, the distance is not near. What kind of effective implementation is needed? What kind of strict adherence to the law is needed? Only then can it be successfully achieved, and this is the most enthusiastic expectation of the public.</p>
<p>Finally, we deeply feel that stabilizing people's livelihoods is already being planned by the government. If everyone works together and cooperates to move forward, then people's livelihoods will naturally be stabilized, and the government's position will inevitably be strengthened. Cotton yarn and cloth are indeed essential for people's livelihoods, but food is even more important. We hope that the government will, in the near future, give practical adjustments to food in addition to the purchase of yarn and cloth. For example, the amount of household rice in this city is still the same, but the time has been extended, which inevitably makes the public frown. Now that the concessions have just been taken over, the authorities should do their best to maintain and increase the food supply to boost public morale. We have said everything we can, and we are discussing it incidentally.</p>

<p>For months, Chairman Wang has been deeply concerned about regulating prices, punishing hoarding, in order to revive the economy and stabilize people's livelihoods, and actively cooperate with the Greater East Asia War. After careful deliberation, he decided on emergency economic measures. Yesterday afternoon, he convened a temporary meeting of the National Defense Council to resolve the essential guidelines and interim regulations for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. After the meeting, the Chairman, in the name of the President of the Executive Yuan, issued a statement as follows:</p>

Recently, prices have been rising sharply, and the trend is getting worse. If we do not take effective measures, economic recovery and people's livelihood stability will be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>In order to stabilize prices, punish hoarding, enhance the value of currency, and protect the interests of legitimate merchants, the government, at today's National Defense Council meeting, resolved to implement the "Interim Regulations on the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth" from today. The National Commercial Control Association will be responsible for handling cotton yarn and cloth stored in Shanghai. For the sake of the interests of the entire people, the government will overcome all difficulties and resolutely implement this extraordinary measure. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will understand the government's intentions, support the national policy, and abide by the law.</p>
<p>Regarding the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, our friendly nation, Japan, has also adopted the same measures and is actively assisting us. All cotton yarn and cloth owned by Japanese merchants in China will also be handled according to this principle. This cooperative spirit is deeply appreciated. We also hope that merchants from other friendly nations will understand the intentions of the National Government and continue to provide active assistance. As for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth from Chinese and foreign merchants, the government should take the maintenance of people's livelihood and the increase of production as the main purpose, formulate reasonable allocation methods, and properly plan the distribution. In addition to the already determined foreign trade and the exchange of materials in various places, it should strive to use it for domestic people's livelihood needs in order to revive the economy. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will have a deep understanding of this.</p>

<h3 id="e6">The National Government Implements the Purchase of Yarn and Cloth Japanese Ambassador Issues a Statement Actively Assisting the National Government in Adopting the Same Measures <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai, Central News Agency, 9th. Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani, recently issued a statement on the National Government's decisive implementation of the purchase of yarn and cloth, which roughly stated that since China entered the war, the National Government has been carrying out various measures to cultivate combat power and stabilize people's livelihoods in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. In view of the fact that price countermeasures should be promoted in cooperation, the Interim Regulations on Punishing Crimes of Hoarding Major Commodities were promulgated and implemented. A Materials Investigation Committee was organized to find a large amount of registered yarn and cloth in stock. In order to implement state management and reasonable allocation, and to prevent the recurrence of hoarding, the Interim Regulations on the Purchase of Yarn and Cloth were specially promulgated and implemented. The first goal is the yarn and cloth owned by Chinese merchants in Shanghai that has been fully registered, and all of it will be forcibly purchased by the National Commercial Control Association. The purchase price will be determined based on 10,000 yuan per bale of 20-count Blue Phoenix cotton yarn. In order to avoid the rapid occurrence of capital, appropriate measures will be taken, so not only can important materials be ensured, but also the price of Central Reserve Certificates can be stabilized, and the sound production and exchange of materials can be restored, which will greatly contribute to the economic recovery and the stability of people's livelihoods. The Japanese side deeply feels that this measure is the most effective and appropriate, and at the same time, the Japanese side expresses its respect for the National Government's determination and launching of strong political power. The Japanese side will also implement the purchase of all yarn and cloth owned by Japanese merchants by the Japan-China Trade Federation at the same price as the Chinese side, and the payment will be made according to the principle of the regulations of the Chinese side, in addition to the public price registered in Japan. The Japanese military and political authorities will give the greatest cooperation to this. It is hoped that the Japanese expatriates will deeply understand the significance of this and abide by these regulations to show their determination to serve the public sincerely under the decisive battle, cooperate to establish a stable economic foundation in Central China, ensure important materials and reduce prices, so as to achieve the purpose of maintaining currency, and move towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 9th. Commander General Ri Yan went to North China and Mengjiang on the 2nd of this month for inspection and returned to Nanjing on the 7th. He also issued a statement as follows: This inspection of North China and Mengjiang lasted about a week. The officers and soldiers are full of vigor in this hot summer. The local officials and people are all united to cooperate with the garrison troops and engage in mop-up operations. Chinese officials and people can also recognize the situation and engage in the construction of a new China with a sincere attitude and a belief in victory. This is truly gratifying. According to the comprehensive efforts of the Chinese and Japanese military officers and people this time, the combat power is increasing day by day, and the construction is progressing day by day. The belief that the long-term war will be won is now more solid. However, the still restless common bandits in the area attempt to disrupt public order. This not only hinders the advancement of Chinese administration and the development of new China's construction, but even sacrifices the people in the name of resisting the war to expand their own labor range. This should not be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Britain and the United States Implement Amphibious Strategy in the Mediterranean The Powerful German Army Prevents the Enemy from Deepening The Battle in Northern Sicily is in Full Swing <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency, 9th. According to the Maritime News Agency, a German news military interviewer wrote today, stating that those who study the current war situation must have a basic understanding, that is, the difference between land warfare and amphibious warfare. The so-called amphibious warfare is the offensive launched by Britain and the United States in Sicily and the tactics that will be engaged in the Mediterranean. Germany is the strongest in Europe, and only land warfare can defeat it. Today, the only one who can contend with the German army is the Soviet Union. Although the strength and experience of the Soviet army are admired throughout the world, it cannot make a decisive victory over the German army. Then, for the British and American armies, with the British army as the main force, to accomplish what the Soviet army cannot accomplish is tantamount to climbing a tree to catch fish. Taking the situation in Sicily as an example, although the Allied forces of Britain and the United States can implement an amphibious strategy on the Mediterranean island, if they deepen inland, not under the cover of naval artillery, the British and American armies will be forced to fight the strongest army in the world, and their experience and strength will inevitably show their inferiority.</p>
<p>Rome, Central News Agency, 9th. Today's war report from the Italian military headquarters stated that in the northern part of the Sicilian front line, fierce battles are in progress in front of the German-Italian military positions. The Axis aircraft fiercely attacked the central points of the rearguard. The German air force effectively attacked two light cruisers and destroyers near Sicily. The British and American naval and air force units carried out ineffective bombing on the coasts of Sicily and Calabria yesterday.</p>

<p>Yangon, Central News Agency, 9th. Mr. Sawada, the first Japanese ambassador to Burma, presented his credentials to Burmese National Representative Ba Maw in the Burmese Government Hall at 3:30 p.m. on the 9th. Ambassador Sawada arrived at the hall on time with Naval Attaché Kitajo, Counselor Shimazu, Secretary, etc. Burmese Deputy Prime Minister Thakin Mya, Foreign Minister Thakin Nu, etc. were present. First, Ambassador Sawada gave a congratulatory speech to National Representative Ba Maw, stating that the close relationship between Japan and Burma is the key to completing the Greater East Asia War and building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The envoy is now appointed as the first ambassador to your country and will strive to promote friendly relations between Japan and Burma with sincerity and consistency so that the relations between the two countries will be established on the spirit of morality. He will make the best efforts to achieve the purpose of the treaty of alliance between our two countries. After the speech, he presented his credentials. National Representative Ba Maw gave a reply, stating that the independence of Burma is entirely dependent on the sacred power of the Japanese Emperor and the military achievements of the Japanese soldiers. Today, a close relationship between the two countries has been created. It is a pleasure for the seat to be close to Your Excellency the Ambassador and to be appointed as the first ambassador to the country. However, although Burma has gained independence, there are still many difficulties in the future. Therefore, it is hoped that Japan and Your Excellency representing Japan will give great understanding and cooperation, and it is also believed that its request will be granted.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Examining the Problem of Commodity Prices in China <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Seiji</p>
<p>Frequent Movement of Goods</p>
<p>What is even more striking is the unexpected abundance of various goods in the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing. As mentioned earlier regarding the night scene of Nanjing Road, various commodities are being moved or stored throughout the city. If one assumes that goods are being secretly hoarded, then the absolute quantity of materials can be said to be extremely plentiful. Walking through every street corner of Shanghai and Nanjing, it seems impossible to find people so impoverished as to be starving. In the suburbs of Shanghai's Great Western Road and outside Nanjing's Zhongshan Gate, groups of peddlers carry various vegetables, grains, fruits, and other items. Consequently, a wide variety of goods enticing to these people are displayed in abundance in the stores. There are no lines formed at any store to purchase goods. From outward appearances, this state of affairs cannot be considered a situation of material shortage. The state of material shortage may be lurking in deeper currents, unnoticed by people, because many leading figures are unanimously advocating the need to increase production.</p>
<p>Commodity Prices and Currency</p>
<p>Is the cause of the sharp rise in commodity prices since January of this year, particularly after April, really due to currency factors? It is commonly said that the amount of currency has the closest relationship with commodity prices. Because the extent of the issuance of Reserve Certificates has not been announced, the general public assumes that it has reached a considerable quantity, which is wrong. Moreover, the interest rates in the Shanghai market are much higher than last year, and the deposits in banks have visibly decreased according to the announcement of the Silver Money Trade Association, amounting to only a little over 30% of what they were before the China Incident. Furthermore, over 90% of the deposits are current deposits, with fixed-term deposits accounting for less than 10%. In this situation, despite the extremely tight financial conditions, commodity prices are soaring, so it would be inappropriate to judge commodity prices solely from the amount of currency.</p>
<p>Then, can the reason for rising commodity prices be derived from the public's trust in the currency itself? In my opinion, not necessarily. Reserve Certificates are now widely circulating and accepted in a broad area of Central China, and the vastness and speed of their circulation can be described as a surprising phenomenon. Seen in this light, it is also difficult to discover and grasp the reasons for the soaring commodity prices from the currency aspect.</p>
<p>Currently, commodity prices in Shanghai are roughly 70 to 100 times higher than before the China Incident. A five-minute ride in a rickshaw costs ten yuan. A piece of pastry costs three to five yuan. What is the cause of this phenomenon of high commodity prices? What will the future trends be? I do not fully agree with the pessimistic and worried views, and I will not discuss the details here for the time being. The main point is that the reason for the high commodity prices in Central China does not lie in simple economic principles.</p>
<p>Beyond Economic Principles</p>
<p>In summary, the phenomena of the recent economic situation in China, especially the high commodity prices, must be attributed to causes beyond economic principles. The cause beyond economic principles is the psychological effect of the people. The most powerful forces dominating the people's psychology are: the observation of the world war situation by the Chinese people, and the effectiveness of the economic strategies of the enemy's conspiracy. Therefore, we can conclude that the core of the 'economic problem' in China today can only be found in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Other countermeasures should only be implemented along this general direction. When implementing individual, local, and economic measures, the true nature of the situation should be fully understood, and prudent vigilance should be exercised to ensure that our economic policies leave no room for the conspiracies of the British, American, and Chongqing factions to exploit.

<h3 id="e13">Italy Resolves to Uphold Alliance, Not to Make Humiliating Peace. Milan Air Raid Causes Extremely Heavy Damage. <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Rome, September 9th, Central News Agency: Since the political change in Italy, more than ten days have passed. Observing the reaction of the people to the progress of the war situation and to the new government, it can be seen that our country has not yet escaped its predicament. The editorials of various newspapers unanimously express support for the new government to continue the war effort. For example, the Popolo d'Italia recently published an article stating that neutral countries have used the national strength cultivated in the four years of the European war to wait for the arrival of peace. They will take advantage of Anglo-American cooperation to improve their international position, so they are greatly promoting peace at the time of this political change in Italy. However, Italy is determined to uphold its alliance with its allies and give up all political rights to speak. Therefore, peace talks are absolutely impossible. Although Italy has encountered difficulties in the war situation, the Italian army has not been surrounded, and the entire territory of Italy has not been violated. The enemy's intention is to make Italy withdraw from the war and to use the Italian peninsula as a base for attacking Germany. If we are swayed and subdued by their tactics, it will be even easier for enemy troops in Sicily and Sardinia to land in Trieste and Venice in northeastern Italy. If this happens, Germany will certainly not tolerate it, and the defense war of the Alps will unfold in the Po River basin. Northern Italy will become the battlefield for both enemy and us. If we do not rise up to resist the enemy, true peace will not be obtained. We would rather die gloriously in battle than be humiliated and mocked by the world.</p>
<p>Rome, September 9th, Central News Agency: The Stefani News Agency revealed today: A large number of enemy aircraft attacked the residential areas of Milan on Saturday evening, causing serious damage. Between 1:00 AM and 2:30 AM, enemy aircraft flew over the city in formations, dropping countless incendiary bombs and explosives. Among the buildings directly hit were the churches of San Simpliciano, Santa Croce, and San Giovanni. The governor of Milan inspected the disaster area and comforted the injured.</p>

Close attention should be paid to it. Italians should not make rash judgments about the new government, nor should they embellish its great undertakings.</p>
<p>Although the new government does not particularly enjoy praise, it cannot accept unlimited criticism either. Accusations that would aggravate the difficult situation do not help the facts but rather pose a great danger to national security.</p>

<p>According to visitors from Macau, Gao Jiansi (real name Yang), a famous rural educator from Jiangsu, died in Guilin on July 4th due to illness. Gao was from Wuxi and dedicated his life to education. He founded the private Wuxi Middle School, single-handedly providing huge funds, which led to the depletion of his family's wealth. He served as the dean of the Jiangsu Educational Institute for many years, focusing on cultivating talents for rural construction, and was as famous as Zouping in Dingxian, enjoying a high reputation throughout the country. Later, he served as the president of Guangxi University. A few months ago, he resigned due to a worsening lung disease, which eventually led to his death. At the time of his death, only his eldest daughter, Jin Yu, was by his side. He left behind the instructions: "Public before private, others before oneself," and "Be frugal in wartime funeral arrangements." He left behind three sons and four daughters, the youngest of whom is only seven years old, to be raised by his wife, and their education is extremely difficult. Friends and relatives were saddened by the news.</p>

<h3 id="e23">200,000 Tons of Coal Fairly Rationed by Authorities Coal Briquette Factories Increase Production, Supply Becomes More Widespread, Price Limits Set, Absolutely No Overcharges Allowed <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The fuel market situation in the city has returned to normal. According to news from the coal industry yesterday, the mining and transportation operations have been carried out with all efforts in the past month. Statistics show that approximately 200,000 tons of bituminous coal were transported from the production areas in the past month. This coal will be fairly rationed by the authorities, and price limits have been set and strictly enforced. At the same time, a considerable amount of firewood has also been transported recently, so the amount of goods in the city's large and small coal yards has also increased compared to the past. The future supply is expected to be adequate, and there will be no shortage. Although the number of factories resuming operations has increased, the number of coal tickets has also increased sharply, but the authorities will provide a sufficient allocation.</p>
<p>Increased Production of Coal Briquettes</p>
<p>It is also learned that the supply of coal briquettes in stock once decreased. The reason is that the supply of raw materials (coal seams) to the coal briquette factories was slightly changed. In order to maintain normal needs, each factory cautiously controlled the supply to prevent hoarding. Now, the authorities have allocated sufficient raw materials to each manufacturing factory, and in order to consider the needs of the city market and stabilize public sentiment, production is gradually being increased. Therefore, the supply of coal briquettes in stock has become more widespread in recent days, and residents can purchase them for fuel nearby.</p>
<p>Goods Dispatched to the Market</p>
<p>Regarding the thirteenth batch of goods, a total of eight hundred tons of coal, including lump coal and dust coal from Datoushan, were dispatched. The Coal Retailers Association notified the industry to pay for the goods and pick them up with orders from designated agencies within the specified period. It is learned that these coals have already been put on the market separately. However, businesses must sell them at the limited price and must not illegally hide them or raise prices for profit. At the same time, sales are limited to civilian users, and the burning of each factory is strictly prohibited. Anyone who dares to violate this will be punished according to law.</p>

<p>Since the National Government recovered the Shanghai French Concession and renamed it District 8, the education issues in the district have attracted attention from various parties. A reporter from Wangfeng News Agency interviewed Director Nung Juhui of the District Education Office and Deputy Director Chen Yan yesterday. They were received and answered the questions in detail. In the past, the French Concession authorities neglected education. Although the office was open, only four or five people were actually in charge, and most of the management and implementation were perfunctory, which is regrettable. In the future, the office's organization and personnel will be expanded and reformed. The memorandum has been signed and submitted to Director Chen, and an order will be issued soon. The public schools in the district that have been taken over include Lagena Elementary School, Saposai Elementary School, and Remi Public School, and they are currently being actively reorganized. All private primary and secondary schools in the district will be ordered to register and file with the government soon. Other policy outlines will also be announced soon.

<p>Since the authorities implemented food rationing to promote grain policy, they have emphasized the circulation of food and the active increase of production, so that the wartime food problem can be solved smoothly. It is learned that rice in the city could not be transported to Shanghai in large quantities for various reasons for a time. Recently, in order to ensure the rice supply, the Grain Bureau issued procurement certificates, and it is heard that merchants in the city have rushed to apply for them and are purchasing rice from various places.</p>
<p>Rationing Association Issues Loan Rice</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency inquiring with the Zhongzhong Rice Rationing Association, the association was reorganized from the former Zhongzhi Laigu Rationing Association on the 26th of last month. The reason for the reorganization was to reduce the scope. It was also learned that the association transferred the right to purchase national rice to the Rice and Grain Joint Operating Company at the end of June. As of now, although the association has sold off the responsibility of allocating food to the Chinese population, it was indeed persuaded by the Rice and Noodle Rationing Office during the past month to loan the office its stored rice for rations, and the amount loaned was not fixed for each period.</p>
<p>The Exact Number for Last Month, Hoping to Supplement</p>
<p>According to the food allocated by the Grain Department to Shanghai for the Shanghai area in July, a total of 250,000 bags, the United Jin Company's transportation mechanism is not yet flexible, and up to now, only tens of thousands of bags have been transported, so the company should transport the rice that has not yet been transported to Shanghai last month as soon as possible, to supplement the lack of household rice last month.</p>

<p>The campaign to ban opium and gambling in the city has been actively discussed and planned by various concerned authorities. According to reporter inquiries, the authorities are paying great attention to the ban on opium and gambling. Other than the price, the ban on opium and gambling is also urgently needed. The authorities plan to launch a large-scale propaganda campaign first, and then the authorities and the public will cooperate to completely eradicate opium dens and gambling sites and take practical actions. At the same time, residents will be encouraged to report secret opium dens and gambling sites to the authorities, so that the authorities can arrest them. According to sources, a large-scale campaign to ban opium and gambling is expected to be launched next month, and a sound plan is being prepared. At the same time, it is expected that the closure of gambling sites in the city is not far away. The authorities have discussed the livelihood problems of the employees after the gambling sites are closed. As for those who are addicted to opium or other toxic smoking products, the deadline for quitting will also be implemented. Rice Rationing Association Discusses Supply</p>

<p>The fifth round of the Shen Bao Lecturers' Scholarship has been underway for nearly two months. Thanks to donations from all sectors of society, the grants have reached more than 1.2 million yuan as of yesterday. (The number of continued deposits reported includes the surplus from the previous round.)</p>
<p>Thanking Donors from All Sectors of Society Registration and application forms began to be collected at this office. There were nearly 10,000 applications, and more than 6,000 were filled out and submitted. Among them, there were more than 2,000 who had previously received grants. Such a large number of students were worried about dropping out of school, and those who were selected were able to continue their studies. We should express our gratitude to the donors.</p>
<p>Thanking the Teachers for Grading Due to the large number of students applying for the elementary, junior high, and high school grades, Mr. Xu Xuehai of the Youth Association and other teachers presided over the screening test and evaluated 3,000-4,000 student test papers, so that the newspaper's scholarship affairs were fairly allocated. We should express our gratitude to the proctors.</p>
<p>List of Approved Names to be Published Today</p>
<p>The applications for scholarships from the first and second grades of senior elementary school have been reviewed and completed. More than 1,000 students have been approved for assistance. All of them have qualified grades and are from poor families. The list of names for the first grade of senior elementary school will be published on the fourth page of this newspaper today. Tomorrow, the list of names for the second grade of senior elementary school will be published. As for the amount of approved grants, the criteria are as follows: 1. The tuition fees of the schools vary. 2. Those with excellent grades and deceased parents will be given additional miscellaneous fees and book fees in addition to the scholarship. 3. Those with poorer grades will have their grants reduced. 4. Those with failing grades and those from relatively well-off families will not be approved.</p>
<p>Dates for Elementary School Students to Receive Scholarships</p>
<p>All approved students will receive their scholarships in the form of a school-titled check on the 14th and 15th for first grade senior elementary school students and the 16th and 17th for second grade senior elementary school students. Students should bring their original registration certificates to the office, fill out receipts, and collect their scholarships and submitted documents. Those whose grades are not qualified and have not been approved for assistance will have their submitted documents returned by mail.</p>
<p>Welcome Reports, Review at Any Time</p>
<p>After the list of approved names has been published, it is inevitable that letters will be received stating that a certain student's family is relatively well-off, requesting that the scholarship be taken back. The newspaper is deeply grateful for the enthusiasm and assistance of the public and classmates. However, it is difficult to make a fair judgment about a student's family situation without a deep understanding. If someone claims to be poor and deceives the investigators, the newspaper is very willing to have the public report it at any time, and the newspaper will reinvestigate it. However, if the reporter does not provide their name and address and is not responsible, it will be difficult to accept the report.</p>

The entire body wholeheartedly agreed on the principle of thoroughly implementing the short-clothing movement and decided that the preparatory committee would start today. Ten standing committee members were elected, nominated by the Citizens' Welfare Association, the News Federation, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Baojia Committee, and the Five National Sports (on a group basis).

<p>Shanghai District Procuratorate Moves Part of Its Office</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Procuratorate, after formally announcing its establishment on the 1st of this month, found that its original office space was insufficient due to the expansion of the procuratorial system. Therefore, yesterday it moved the offices of the Chief Procurator and the Chief Secretary to the two-story and three-story buildings opposite, formerly the Judicial Administrative Advisory Office of the French Concession Police Department. The office of the Chief Judge of the Second Special Court was converted into the office of the Chief Procurator, it is said.</p>
<p>Zhou Yuchan Discusses Speculation "On Real Estate Speculation"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Yuying, Director of the Nanshi Office of the Ministry of Social Welfare, was invited by the Anti-Anglo-American Association of the Chinese Nation to speak on the Shanghai Radio Station at 9:30 PM last night (the 9th), on the topic "On Real Estate Speculation." Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Real estate speculation in Shanghai was initially controlled by foreigners. The average Shanghai citizen has long suffered from the problem of housing. In the four or five years after the incident [likely referring to the outbreak of the war], real estate was not favored due to security concerns, and there were many materials that could be hoarded. Real estate could not be hidden, so the phenomenon of real estate speculation can be said to have stopped. Unfortunately, in the past year, Shanghai's order has stabilized, investment targets have decreased, and too much idle capital has accumulated. Real estate speculation has been revived. The current real estate speculation involves three types of people: first, those with strong financial resources; second, land speculators with some financial resources; and third, "land ghosts" who have no financial resources and specialize in advising homeowners and establishing shell real estate companies. If the government authorities do not quickly seek to ban and remedy this, housing disputes will disrupt the entire Shanghai. Therefore, I say that if Shanghai does not implement a policy of "equalization of land rights" as soon as possible to correct speculative real estate practices, many real estate disputes may lead to a violent real estate revolution.</p>
<p>Indian Community Holds Public Meeting Yesterday to Commemorate One Week Anniversary of Gandhi's Imprisonment</p>

<p>The second round of the North China Emergency Relief Charity Basketball Tournament, jointly organized by the Paramount and North China Athletic Associations, is scheduled to start at 7 PM tonight at the YMCA, where the two teams will engage in fierce competition. Tickets are divided into four types: Honorary Tickets worth 1,000 yuan, Patron Tickets worth 500 yuan, Special Tickets worth 300 yuan, and Ordinary Tickets worth 20 yuan. In the first game on the 8th, North China fought hard and eventually reversed the defeat, defeating Paramount by a score of 32 to 24. In tonight's second game, the prelude will be a drama between the Central Trust and the Central Bank. The former has drama stars such as Shi Hui, while the latter's players have superb ball skills. The latter is organized by colleagues from the Central Reserve Bank and has long been known for its strong fighting power in the banking industry. The main battle is between Paramount and North China. Paramount unfortunately lost to North China yesterday. The reason for the defeat was not due to a lack of fighting spirit, but because Captain Chen Xianglong miscalculated, resulting in a lack of leadership. Tonight's game is crucial to the outcome of the championship. Paramount wants to wash away this humiliation and will go all out. The schedule for tonight and the player lists for North China and Paramount are as follows:</p>
<p>Drama - Central Trust vs. Central Bank (starts at 7 PM)</p>
<p>North China vs. Paramount (second game) - 8 PM</p>

<h3 id="e36">Commentary: The Gains of the Japanese Delegation to China <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>In the spring of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], the gains of the Japanese delegation to China were the assistance of the Shanghai Japanese Bankers' Association with the legal tender policy, handing over silver reserves to be exchanged for legal tender. Unfortunately, due to the Xi'an Incident, further economic cooperation between the two countries was not possible. This July, Japan sent a second delegation to China, led by Masatane Ogura, with Akio Ishii, Saburo Nanjo, and Kozo Kotera as members. Although the gains from their visit have not yet been seen in fact, the views expressed by the four after returning home seem to allow for some preliminary speculation.</p>
<p>Ogura believes that to solve the current economic problems in Central China, first, political and economic relations must be integrated; second, the guiding economic ideology must be transformed from private interests to public interests; and third, people's livelihood must be stabilized so that everyone can maintain their minimum living standards amidst wartime austerity. "It seems very difficult to increase production immediately in Shanghai, but if China provides resources and labor, and Japan provides capital and technology," it may not be difficult.</p>
<p>Ishii believes that to accomplish the Great East Asia War, friendship between Japan and China is a prerequisite, and that the economy of Central China must be controlled in the Chinese way. The excessive number of banks in Central China is also a cause of currency instability.</p>
<p>Nanjo believes that manufacturing industries centered on Shanghai's lack of money certainly have the potential for revitalization, and that the prerequisite for this is a steady supply of raw materials.</p>
<p>Kotera believes that China's textile industry has reached world standards, so Japan should entrust this industry to the Chinese mainland while focusing on high-level, precision heavy industries. Therefore, it is necessary for Japanese textile factories to move to the mainland and cooperate with China.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Speculative Financial Institutions Will Gradually Collapse Automatically <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The national government, in view of the increasingly rampant hoarding of goods in Shanghai, which has caused prices to soar endlessly and greatly affected people's livelihood and social order, has specially commissioned the heads of relevant Chinese and Japanese departments to form a Materials Investigation Committee. The committee has appointed investigators to lead investigation teams to investigate the stockpiling of goods in warehouses throughout the city. On the one hand, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank will investigate the lending business of various financial institutions in batches. If any hoarding behavior is found, or if loans are suspected of being used for speculative goods, they will be reported immediately and punished according to law by the competent authorities, and their hoarded goods will be confiscated. Therefore, general hoarding merchants are greatly panicked, and all goods stored in warehouses cannot be moved or sold. According to a Central News Agency reporter, reliable sources have recently reported that due to the authorities' thorough investigation of goods and strict prohibition of moving hoarded goods, financial institutions have greatly tightened their acceptance of warehouse receipts as collateral for loans, effectively halting lending operations. This has made it difficult for newly established financial institutions that use speculative funds to turn around their funds. Following the suspension of business by the Jiangduan Qipiao Bank the other day, it was reported yesterday (the 9th) that many newly established financial institutions are engaging in disguised loan sharking. It is hoped that the entire financial industry will gradually move towards normal development thereafter.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Stock Market Trends <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market opened with a sharp decline. The financial sector was particularly affected, with tight credit conditions putting pressure on speculators to liquidate their positions. Investors were cautious amidst the turmoil, and stock prices continued to fall. Sentiment across the board was generally weak. The textile industry suffered the worst decline, with Wing On Textile breaking through two levels and falling to around the 17 yuan mark. Among the smaller stocks, only Meilun was relatively stable. The others, such as Xinfeng, Guoxin, Great China, Hongshen, Zhenfeng, Lunhua, Xinhe, and Renji, all continued to decline. In the department store sector, Lai Lai Department Store remained stable amidst the rumors of a capital increase. Wing On fell below the 70 yuan mark. New World and National Goods both declined by dozens of yuan. China Underwear rebounded by a small amount of a dozen yuan. Jinghua Shirt only found buyers after falling to within 50 yuan. Jinglun also declined. In the cultural sector, Commercial Press also experienced a decline, falling by 200 yuan. China fell to below 1,000 yuan. World broke below the 60 yuan mark. Yongxiang Printing, after dividend payout, opened high, exceeding the face value by 60-70%. Standard Paper traded at 55% of face value. Popular Paper fluctuated around the 30 yuan mark. Both British American Tobacco and Great China Match broke below their face value. In the utility sector, the Northern Water Company and the difficult-to-operate Shanghai Electric Power both declined by dozens of yuan, with the latter falling to the 30 yuan mark. In the new industries sector, Xinya Pharmaceutical also declined daily. Wuzhou retreated, Xinye was stable, and Xinya Weisu and Xin Xing also declined. The science wind also started, with both Jiuan and Great China Three Industrial, China, and Guohua Investment experiencing significant declines. Xinya Construction was weak, and Qinghua and both Xin Yi Real Estate also reported being unable to support prices. Standard Weiwei MSG and Jimi Foods both saw declines. Kang Yuan Candy alone reported strong performance. Jinfeng Paper. Shanghai Tricycle. Dahua Value, China Clock Factory, and Zhongxing Wood were pressured amidst an imbalance between supply and demand and tended to weaken. Utility Electric Power and Xiang Sheng Automobile made their debut, but investors hesitated. The price of the former exceeded face value by 26%, while the latter exceeded it by 170%.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Firewood Shortage to be Subject to Controlled Procurement <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Firewood is a necessity for people's daily life and is also a major industrial fuel in times of coal shortage. Because the city and surrounding areas are located on the coast and lack mountains and forests, the source of firewood is very limited. In the past, it relied solely on the felling of miscellaneous trees by farmers in the rural areas along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Jiaxing roads, which were then transported to Shanghai for sale. However, over time, the trees in the countryside have been cut down to the point of depletion, so the price has gradually soared, causing fuel panic, which is quite concerning. It is reported that the government authorities, in view of the current situation, believe that it is necessary to set a price limit and control the purchase of firewood. Therefore, they are now actively preparing everything, and it is expected to be implemented in early next month. As for the areas where controlled purchases will be made in the future, they will be the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai. The purchase price has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Shanghai Match Factories Increase Production <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The supply of matches in the market is insufficient, and the price has soared, which has had a significant impact on people's livelihood. Therefore, the Business Control Association has designated the Match Industry Joint Association to actively prepare matches for allocation to households to meet the basic needs. It is reported that the Sino-Japanese joint venture China Match Company and the Meiguang Match Company, which was transferred from the Japanese side to the management of the national government, have both actively started work and are working hard to increase production. The output of the two companies accounts for about 40% of the total consumption in Central China, so the supply and demand of matches is expected to improve in the future. The Business Control Association has also ordered the match industry association to assist the employees of various factories in finding ways to dredge the sources.</p>
