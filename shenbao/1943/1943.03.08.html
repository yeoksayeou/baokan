<p>社評</p>
<h3>婦女節獻詞</h3>
<p>年年此日，婦女們慶祝自己的節日，我全國姊妹們在今天一定也有熱烈的情緒；而回首往昔，瞻念來茲，更應該有無限的感觸與遠大的希望吧。然而我們中國婦女在今天慶祝自己的節日，應該有更　大的意義，因為我們是在戰時，新的使命賦與我們每一個有知識的婦女，我們要擔負下來。</p>
<p>戰時婦女，應該是國家勝利的最重要的一種決定力量，無論是日本，德國，和蘇聯，這些國家的婦女們，都已為祖國的戰爭而　　　　，代替男人到農塲，到工廠，到交通機關去擔負　重要的工作。她們到前方去慰勞，她們為前方的將士準備精神和物質上的慰勞品，她們更為維持後方的安寗，為救濟難民，敎養難童，協助防空，維持治安而努力。她們活躍在前方，後方，和男子們一樣的勇敢，比男子們有更值得誇耀的。苦幹，忍耐和守法的精神。可是，回顧我國婦女們如何？一般無知天識的不必說了，就已受過高等敎育的來說吧，有的是在政治舞台活動，目的只是利用政治地位來滿足自己安富尊榮。多少男人為供應妻子無限之慾求，而做那禍國殃民的事情。多少男人為女子的逾分奢侈而造成社會的罪惡。我們今日應針對這種現象，呼籲一般高知識婦女，以身作則，消極的不作妨害社會風氣阻碍國家國策的事情，如奢侈浪費；另一方面，積極起來，號召全國婦女，參加戰時工作，參加戰時社會公益事業，推進婦女為國家服務的運動，看看日，德，蘇，婦女界為國奮鬥的事實，我們能不奮發圖強嗎？</p>
<p>其次，我們要鄭重的指出，除了上流極少數的智識婦女和旣富又貴的上層婦女之外，我國最大多數的婦女，是在無知無識的狀態，是在饑寒交迫之中，我們希望全國的婦女團　，密切合作，推動目前迫急需要的幾件大事：第一，是婦女貧病的擴大救濟運動，也就是我中華民族下一代國民之母性的救濟運動，各婦女慈善機關，應求其機構之更加健全與發展。各醫院醫師產科醫院等，應有特別優待貧苦婦女的辦法，並求其普遍與切實。第二，我們更期待政府和社會國體密切協力，多設免費的　產醫院和托兒所等，解除一般婦女的家務束縛，使能為社會為國家盡更多的力量。第三，我們呼籲當局和各工廠，公司，商店，優待及保護女工，女職員的辦法。第四，我們希望一般女子敎育的發展，特別是平民識字敎育，成年女子補習敎育和女子戰時服務敎育，女子職業敎育等之普遍發展。無論為家庭婦女，或準備為社會為國家服務，新時代的婦女，是必須具有識字，讀報，寫作和一種維持生活必須的技能的。何况戰時後方的工作，戰時新國家的建設，還都期待着我們婦女界和男子們共同努力奮鬥呢。</p>
<p>醒覺吧，中國的婦女。振奮和團結起來吧，中國的新女性。新中國的前途，需要我們二萬萬以上的婦女們協力奮鬥！</p>

<h3>德國對英美的潛艇攻防戰</h3>
<p>據德軍大本營二十六日的特別公報，二月中，德潛水艦隊擊沉的敵船舶有八十艘，合計五十三萬四千三百輛。這說明了去年十二月以來英美所焦慮的對抗潛艇戰爭的失敗。這現狀若繼續下去，英本國的食糧問題，援助蘇聯問題，自不必說，卽在聯合國的歐洲登陸作戰上，也難免有很重大的惡影響。</p>
<p>一月三十日，潛水艦隊司令長官卡爾·台尼茲提督的昇任德國海軍總司令，卽為德國在海洋上以潛水艦為主力的明證。上月五日，據美國海軍委員長蘭特的談話，德國每日建造潛艇一艘，並承認這造艦率高於英美的德艦擊沉率。海軍部長諾克斯也說現在活動於大西洋的德國潛水艦數目，較去年六月為多。而且除了數量的增加之外，德國潛水艦的性能亦有顯著的改善，潛水油槽船，潛水母艦等的使用，以及哨戒，案敵，攻擊上的新戰術，尤其是用集團潛艇的作戰方法，更增加了德國潛艇的威力。對此，英美方面則用強化護術艦艇，改善被護送船隻具體的防禦設備，繼續不休的轟炸德國造船所及基地等方法來應付。但徴以一二月中德國潛水艦的戰績，並不見遜於去年十二月的事實，則英美的努力並沒有什麼效果。以前的護航制度，旣不能盡其任務，於是有很多人提議把運輸船的速率，從現在的十一海浬左右，提高至十五或十七海浬。然而卽使速率增加了四海浬，不僅在造船上有種種不便，裝貨噸位上有許多不利，就　這些問題都解決了，對於最新式潛艦水上速度二十三海浬的高速率，仍不免有許多　點　即使英美造成了很多的船舶，而發送護航制度至上述的程度，但在目前大量被擊沉於海底的現狀下，終未能使局勢有　顯著的變化。</p>
<p>英美派送大兵至歐洲大陸的時候，假令每一兵士需要船積入噸，則一　　　兵士預計就需八百萬噸。現在英美無此能力，所以單就此點而言，德義目前在歐洲大陸所佔的地位，亦不是輕易所能撼動的。換句話說，潛艦戰旣可制英本國的死命，又為保護歐陸的武器。（翔：譯自二月二十八日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>英美對採攻勢　誇大宣傳　但事實上不可能</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城七日中央社電　英·美陣營自羅斯福邱吉爾在加薩勃朗加會談後、因表面上似稍見振作、乃即於國內外竭力作誇大宣傳、邱吉爾曾揚言謂、本年內將於中歐實行登陸作戰、羅斯福亦謂將轉取攻勢、進攻日本本土、但究其積極宣傳之正意果何在乎？其全會之內面、又有若何計劃乎？吾人試一觀此次大戰、反軸心國方面、傾其國家總力而作戰者、僅有蘇聯與渝方、然兩者已均為反軸心國所利用、故斯達林委員長及蔣介石、對於其同盟國英·美所取之狡猾態度、亦至為不滿、同時英·美兩國國民亦責難其政府脆弱無能、且以深甚之失望、懷疑英·美兩國軍隊究竟所為何事、且有問美國艦隊豈僅活動於好萊塢之攝影塲者乎？凡此責難、固亦皆有其相當之理由、英·美兩國雖已於去年在北非發動攻勢、但突尼西亞方面之德·議軍隊仍屢奏膚功、獲得偉大戰果、而美軍則遭受重大打擊、故羅斯福所謂「吾人必一一征服各島嶼、以攻入日本本土」之狂囈、即其自國國民亦難有一人敢於置信、羅斯福邱吉爾於此、乃深感必須以驚人喜劇、以為興奮劑、於是乃有加薩勃朗加會談之舉行、但該次會談因有其他多數反軸心軍首腦參加、故可以認英·美在本年中或將有所舉動、蓋若英·美果仍毫無行動、則不僅英·美國內戰綫、有發生重大反動之可能、即蘇聯及渝方、亦將因鑒于英·美之無能、而宣吿退出其聯盟、英美在此情勢危急之中、究欲如何開始其行動、自極深感苦惱、於是乃又從事宣傳謂、即將展開大攻勢、故其此次宣傳之動機、實不外下列各點、即一、此次英·美之宣傳將對軸心軍展開大攻勢、其隱含之最後目的、無非為期與軸心國作戰到底、而作長期消耗戰、並圖保全其兵力、此為英·美完遂此次大戰之基本原則、亦即為彼等遂行戰爭之手段、二、此次英、美宣傳大攻勢之內面、企圖沮喪軸心軍之士氣及離間日、德、義三國之團結、三、加薩勃朗加會談以來、英、美雖屢次宣傳將有所舉動、而實際上、至多僅作小規模之攻擊、四、英、美為期仍以蘇聯及渝方供其犧牲、故以宣傳即將展開大攻勢為鉺、竭力拉攏蘇聯及渝方參加其反軸心陣營、五、英、美不僅企圖於軸心軍佔領區、釀成不穩空氣、同時且圖威脅其他國家之中立政策、最近英、美之積極進行策動、期煽惑土耳其、西班牙、瑞典等國放棄中立、至為顯然、土耳其總統於最近之聲明中、即足以反映英、美之此種陰謀已在土國進行至相當程度、反之、英、美對西班牙之策動、則因始終無成功希望、而有放棄之意、對於瑞典、英、美仍繼續伸其魔手、圖使其放棄中立、此外、美國為圖使芬蘭與英國單獨媾和、亦於暗中進行甚烈、同時在拉丁美洲方面、由於美國長期進行政治謀略之結果、現智利已為其所誘而與軸心國斷絕邦交、拉丁美洲各國已被拉攏參加反軸心陣營、現西半球之中立國、已僅餘阿根廷一國、在此情勢下、彼等之未來謀略為何、實已昭然若揭、要而言之、加薩勃朗加會談後、英、美方面所以大肆宣傳之目的、實為其圖作長期消耗戰之一幕、故其作此即將展開大攻勢之宣傳者、無非欲遂其延長戰爭之妄想而已、</p>

<h3>協力精神貴乎自發—一個羣力造橋的實例</h3>
<p>安徽省明光、定遠間的一段公路，建築非常困難，其中尤以建設梅市鎭的橋樑工程更難。在這裏就有一段富有同生共死精神的美談。華中鐵道的明定公路綫（安徽省明光—定遠綫）工程、從去年底起開工，在這工程中最難的一段，更算是架設梅市鎭的橋樑，因為那時候天氣正冷，　　又　，民衆們　　以　的明定公路，也不知道什麽時候可以完工通車。</p>
<p>某日有人去訪問〇〇守備隊長，叱人就是梅市鎭的鎭長鍾少卿氏，為人有長者之風，村民愛之如冬日，敬之若慈父。他那一次因為知道梅市鎭橋樑的工程不易，就去訪問〇〇守備隊長，很慨然的說把這個工程交給我幹，因為公路交通是我們的生命綫，所以自願分任其勞。〇〇隊長聽他一番熱論，大為感動，就和華中鐵道方面的公路工程處談妥，請他幫着辦理這件事。</p>
<p>鍾鎭長得到這樣一個結果，非常痛快，立刻就到附近的居民家裏，一家一家去說明原委，他這種熱誠的血心，打動了每一個人的心弦，接着就有許多居民帶了踿和爬跑到鍾鎭長家裏，集合出發去建築橋樑。</p>
<p>在人民團結羣策羣力之下，鎭長風雨無阻，每大親自督率，終於克服了一切困難，到本月上旬為上，已經完成了十分之九的工程，現在不過極小部份的一段了。</p>
<p>預定在全部完工之後，還要舉行盛大的通車典禮。華中鐵道方面，對於鍾鎭長這種大無畏精神，能夠捨身為公，極為嘉許，決定在舉行通車典禮的時候，當場表揚他的功績。（雲鵬譯自三月七日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>戰時經濟苦悶中的英帝國（下）</h3>
<p>— 龍飛</p>
<p>（三）財政膨脹與國民負擔</p>
<p>英國財相伍德氏於一九四二年四月發表一九四二—四三年度總額五十二億八千六百萬鎊的預算，據上年度歲出實數增加五億一千萬鎊，比戰前一九三八—三九年度歲出十億六千八百萬鎊，有了加倍的巨額，實為英國財政史上空前龐大的預算，前次大戰中英國戰費最高額為一九一八年之佔國民所得六十四%，而現在英國國民所得推定額為八十五億鎊，戰費已佔其六十四%了。</p>
<p>英國財政與國民所得表</p>
<p>為年度初之估計×為一九四一年四月之估計</p>
<p>依據「經濟學者」雜誌，國債為年度初之數字</p>
<p>戰爭第一年的一九三九—四〇年度以來三年間的歲出，加入上年度的預算，實達一百五十七億七千萬鎊之巨額，超過了上次大戰戰費總數十五億鎊的五十%。在英國財政中，稅收的地位，較別國為高，一向有四〇%以上依靠稅收，但仍不能茍免於國民財產的縮减。卽據「經濟學者」的調查，一九四〇—四一年度政府支出與國民消費合計超過國民所得約九億五千萬鎊，一九四一—四二年度超過十三億五千萬鎊，國民財產的縮减日益增加，喪失了戰前四十億鎊在外資產的六〇%。</p>
<p>這種傾向，由於今後戰費支出之增大而有愈益增進之勢，而五十二億鎊的預算額，三月，六月，九月，十月，各十億鎊，計有四十億鎊的支出，已得議會承認，上年度的預算額便只剩下十億餘鎊了。再就每一天平均的戰費支出額，亦已從一九四二年六月之一千二百萬鎊至九月為一千二百二十五萬鎊，至十月為一千五百萬鎊，由於戰局之日趨擴大，最近更有驚人的增加。</p>
<p>針對着戰費的增大，財相伍德氏在發表上年度預算時，提出了新的增稅案，規定啤酒稅，酒稅，烟草稅，戲劇塲稅，奢侈品販賣稅等增徵，企圖由此每年增加一億五千萬鎊的稅收，這裏不能不注意的是關於所得稅及其他直接稅之增徵，還沒有實行，大槪國民對於這種負擔已到了極限之故。從前所得稅的實情來看，從戰前的五先令六辦士，順次增加為七先令六辦士，八先令六辦士，十先令，現在所得稅與附加稅合計，最高達十九先令六辦士，即一鎊之中，實收祗為六國士。這樣，那裏還能提高？在戰前，所得稅收入為四億鎊，而一九四二年預算中附加稅估計為九億八千萬鎊。而以國民每人計，則租稅負擔平均額已從戰前之二十四鎊一先令增加至現在的五十一鎊十四先令，免稅點减低至二百五十鎊。</p>
<p>其次，戰時超過所得稅率，已增一〇%，收入估計為四億鎊。不過，在超過所得稅中，歸還二成，　作為戰後復興資金，加計其他財產稅等在內，直接稅的收入為八億鎊。另一方面，間接稅，酒與烟消費的稅各二億鎊，購買稅率為三三%至六六%，大部份為六六%，其收入槪算為八千四百萬鎊。</p>
<p>此外，加拿大對英本國獻納物資十億元（二億二千五百萬鎊），這一筆賬算在一九四一年度的國庫收入中的。</p>
<p>一九四二年度預算額五十二億鎊中，稅收為二十五億鎊，其餘二十六億鎊，就不得不乞之於借款。即以國民儲蓄十九億鎊及在外資本之消耗七億鎊加以補充，但這一筆較上年加倍的儲蓄金是否能夠足額，還是一個疑問。所以，今後龐大的戰時財政的維持，勢不能不進一步限制國民消費，因為除了降低國民生活水準以節約為補充之外，沒有別的路了。</p>
<p>英國食糧配給與戰前消費量比較表</p>
<p>英國食糧情况表</p>
<p>依據蘇聯「世界政治與世界經濟」雜誌</p>
<p>為一九三四年—一九三六年平均數</p>
<p>（四）物價與工資問題</p>
<p>從英國最近物價推移的指數來看，第二次世界戰前—一九三九年八月底指數為一三八·九，一年後騰貴至一七四·四，為二十五%；兩年後又升至一八五·一，而一九四二年六月底續升至一八六·二，開戰後五月間，騰貴達三四%</p>
<p>然而，繼物價波動中的各種物資的各期情形來看，則其騰貴而不如上述那樣輕微。這也可以看出輸入困難，勞動力不足，和軍事費支出之增高，構成了物價上昇的不可援救的因素。據英國商務部發表，自開戰以來，至一九四二年四月止，在此期間，物價騰貴，食品價格漲七十七%，製造品價格漲五十六元。從個別商品來看，則羊毛為六七·五%，棉花為七四·九%，織物額為七〇·七%。</p>
<p>物價騰貴中，還不能不注意到數量的减少，開戰後二年間，零售販賣總數量比戰前减少二十五%，對國民消費生活方面的負擔則加重了，關於這些，依據勞工部發表的生活費指數（以一九四一年七月為基準）一九三九年九月一日為一五五，九月底為一六五，一九四二年三月底升至一九九，四月底更升至二〇〇。</p>
<p>物價騰貴，工資自應跟着上昇，各國都因此而感苦痛。從煤磯工人要求增加工資一事，可以看出英國物價政策的一個破綻。一九四十年四·五月開始工資爭議，當待決定以六月中每週最低工資八十三先令制為基準，暫為解決，但以煤礦業之統制，引起資本家不滿，而至七月一日起，政府終於實行由國家管理全部煤礦。不過，民需軍船兩方面物價的不平衡的發展，其中的矛盾及其影響，是可以想像得到的。</p>
<p>無論如何，隨着今後物價統制的加強，不能發深刻的社會問題，這是不可否認的。</p>
<p>陷於戰時經濟苦中的「大英帝國」正在步步走上滅亡之途。（完）</p>

<h3>國際婦女節　滬特別市婦女會告婦女書</h3>
<p>全國諸姑姊妹們：</p>
<p>慶祝今年的「三八」婦女節，我們引起二種感想：回想到過去，長興奮的，但瞻望着未來，却是嚴肅的。</p>
<p>憑婦女運動先進者的努力奮鬥，三十餘年來，我們婦女界，掙脫了封建的鐐銬，在重重壓迫和種種束縛之中獲得解放，至今日我們爭取了政治地位的平等，經濟地位的平等，法律地位的平等，益以我們團結自愛，使爭得的平等地位，日臻鞏固，並確保住了永久的勝利，這如何不使我們興奮呢。</p>
<p>但新時代所賦予我們婦女界的使命，已不僅是獲得了政治，經濟，和法律上地位的平等，就可滿足。因爲新的中國在成長，新的東亞在發展，整個世界是在新的轉變中進行，我們站在新的歷史前面，就不能不覺悟，我們過去爭的是權利，但今後將要負担起責任來了。救中國，保東亞，甚之改造世界，我們婦女也得負担責任，這又如何不使我們感覺嚴肅呢。</p>
<p>權利我們爭得了，今後；我們可以逃避責任嗎？自尊心在答覆我們：不能！我們生於今日，是以逃避責任爲恥辱的！</p>
<p>於此，我們謹以一腔赤誠，願忠吿各階層婦女同胞，分述有如下幾點：</p>
<p>（一）　我們希望一般家庭婦女，而今而後，大家一致實行節約。同時，痛戒奢侈，因物價的高漲，及生活的困難，業已形成嚴　問題，積極的辦法固然有政府在策劃，但消極的補救，還得應由我們自己努力維持。對於敎育子女，乃是我們的天職，非但不可玩忽，尤須特別加以注意。因從大處着想，簡直悠關乎整個民族的優劣，豈司等閒？</p>
<p>（二）　我們希望一般職業婦女者，最重要的，是應該努力充實自己的能力，提高生活的技藝，把我們的自尊心堅强起來，把我的依賴性掃除干凈，我們應有一個信念，不僅以使人愛爲光榮，更要以使人敬爲榮譽，我們要把婦女的人格，在對社會盡義務，和對國家盡責任的一點上建立起來。這種企求，我們不僅希望職業婦女覺悟或瞭解，尤其希望全體職業婦女身體力行，樹立楷模。</p>
<p>（三）　我們希望求學婦女，切切實實讀書，研究點致用學問，求點眞實智識，作爲自己將來服務社會的基礎，尤其應該知道，浮華不是美德，虛榮足以敗身。求學婦女，以環境論，以經濟論，都可以說是得可獨厚，豈可以不講求自愛？倘在求學時代，因循蹉跎過去，以後社會要你盡些義務，你不能，國家要你盡責任，你又是不能，且試問你生存的意義與價値何在？今後我們婦女要盡的義務將更多，應盡的責任將更大，更多的義務和更大。責任，將由今日求學婦女雙肩挑起，求學婦女，安可懈於黽勉，而不自知策勵？</p>
<p>（四）　我們對於勞工婦女，實寄予無限的同情，除了敬佩勞工婦女的血汗的貢獻，和深刻的忍苦以外，唯一希望，希望勞工婦女在可能範圍內，多多注意自己的健康，勞工婦女艱辛操作，淡薄的享受，可對天地無愧，所以其他階層的婦女，應該爲你們感動，向你們學習，使自己健全起來。</p>
<p>各階層婦女都進步，綜合了就可以發生力量，道力量用諸於社會，社會得益，用諸於國家，無形中就可輔助國家建設，時至今日，我們應該正視新的時代，接受新的使命，向正確的方向努力，對正確的目標奮鬥，這才符合慶祝今年婦女節的意義，盼望全國婦女界共勉！</p>

<h3>增進國民健康</h3>
<p>— 樂觀</p>
<p>強國必先強種</p>
<p>中國同歐洲各國比較起來，總是事事落後，就是國民健康程度，也不知落後多少倍，爲什麽中國的死亡率，年年佔着世界第一把的交椅？爲什麽中國的平均年齡在世界上最短？爲什麽中國人年齡未滿四十歲，已是白髮蒼蒼，老態龍鍾？雖有其他的原因包含在內；最大的原因，是靑年時代沒有充分的修養與訓練，換句話說，就是中國性敎育不健全體育不發達的緣故，故我們靑年必須在靑年時代養精蓄銳，以備將來爲國家社會服務，否則縱然有高深的學問，奈何當不起這種艱巨的工作，也屬徒然。則不但個人之損失，實全民族之損失。筆者爰將芻蕘之見，述列於後，以供採納。</p>
<p>（一）國家　設立靑年營，歐洲各國和友邦日本，早有這種機關的設立，尤以德義二國成績爲　著，經貿皆由國家援助，凡年滿十四歲的靑年，皆須入營，且是强迫的，訓練限期爲四年，所授功課與普通學校所授的無異，不過運動項目加多，兼授性的方面的智。</p>
<p>（二）改編衛生敎科書，充實有關性智識方面材料，從前所出的衛生敎科書，大郁份關於性智識方面者隻字不提，偶有也不過三言兩語罷了！以後增訂時，能將此問題詳加注意，對於靑年亦不無小補。</p>
<p>（三）國家編印衛生小册子，分發給中學及各大學校，日本的厚生省，每年總不知化了多少的錢，編印這種小冊子的，分給中學及大學，內叙及性病之預防及息後之恐怖，使學生有所覺悟，而不致墮落。</p>
<p>（四）希望國家多多建設體育館及運動塲，像上海從前幾所運動塲皆備碧眼黃髮兒享用，中國人是沒有份兒的，雖然有幾所學校，也有運動塲之設備，不是失之運動器械簡陋，就是面積狹小得很，不　供給多數的人運動，故希國家注意及之，則民族康强優秀有望，</p>
<p>（五）舉辦衛生演講　發衛生刊物。上海衛生刋物之缺乏，是無庸強言，故希望以後親印時，內容以性敎育爲主，並輔以衛生方面的，價格力求低廉，並每星期舉行衛生講座一次，請各著名醫師輪流講演，因爲上海別的講座都是風起雲湧，獨衛生講座闕如故這也値得提倡的。</p>
<p>以上幾點，盼望政府當局，醫界，曁各界努力推進，以底於成，則民族幸甚，國家幸甚。</p>
<h3>書籍的恐慌問題</h3>
<p>— 沈志明</p>
<p>在往時，所謂「裁縫司務無衣穿，種田人無飯吃」，現在竟挨到我們出版業的人們書店老闆無書看，書店老闆的小孩也無書讀的時期了。</p>
<p>在去年，我就和幾個書業同行談過，我的預料是在未來的開學期，書籍將遭恐慌，那時我的根據是（一）書業的營業情形（二）書籍的存量（三）書業的出版方針。</p>
<p>果然不僅別人的小孩買不到書，就是我的小孩也受到同樣的遭遇，因爲書籍恐慌和藥品恐慌等不同，我們並不是將存書囤積了等待「善價而沽」，我們正希望將存書可以早日出淸。所以別人的小孩無書讀，我們從事書業的小孩子在學校中受到同樣待遇的。</p>
<p>現在時間雖隔半年，我的預測依然如此，而且下學期書慌更將嚴重，所以我想將以前我所根據的三點，現在再提出來談談，同時討論討論怎樣解決書慌的辦法。</p>
<p>（一）自大東亞戰爭爆發以後，書業一度停頓，致出版工作全無，這時完全是銷售存貨絕不造貨所謂買完即算的辦法。</p>
<p>（二）書和紙是分不開的，紙在三元錢一令的時候，就是害業蓬勃時期，所以印書多多益善，現在紙價已在五　餘元以上，這時要希望書店多印些書放在棧房裏作囤貨，書店是決不會這樣侵的，何况書店內很少像紙行一樣存了大量的紙張，即使有大量的紙張，也情願放着紙，而不願使白紙變成有黑字的油字紙，所以目前是書店印書盡量减少的時期。</p>
<p>（三）在出版方面，輩以敎科書而論，目前均屬國定，目種類甚少，印行亦有限制，所以舊版倘不可用，新書亦無從出版，要印也無書可印。</p>
<p>那麽這樣說來，書籍是否會永久恐慌下去呢？這也不盡然，下面是我提出的二個辦法</p>
<p>（一）是使生產者和消費者有事前的接洽，書店印書數量普通至一千本，但實際銷去不過數百本，這樣書店棧房內就多了一注存貨，如其書能像棉布藥品等一樣可以團着賣好價，到也無所謂，但書籍的存貨在我們年終的會計結算內，大都是算作「壞帳凖備」。因此學校的當局如其要採用什麽書籍，不妨在半年之前，先向書店接洽或預定，同時書店可　定一個定印辦法，通知各學校敎員及學校當局，請其在半年以內來登記，此項登記組織不必由　書局各自爲政，盡可由五大同行聯合辦理。同時我要老實的說，學校當局在目前如希望各書局推銷員到實校接洽，同時再跌價競售，是不會有的，所以爲避免開學以後缺　的困難，學校和書局最好先有一個合作奮</p>
<p>（二）印書用紙　讀者不要嫌好嫌壞，使成本可以减低，紙的來源可以增加，就是我們　內人，當薄薄的一本書拿在手裏，一看定價十元，也覺釗驚懼。所以　價札書的成本是　關聯的，書店也布望售價賣得低些，書籍雖是「精神糧食」，從事書業的人也　瞭決不能和「物資糧食一一般雖飛漲也會受到歡迎，所以我曾和幾個造紙廠老闆在商洽，怎樣供給一種價廉父可以適用的印書紙。這樣不　紙的來　可以解決，同時書類也可以降低，而印書量及種類也都可以增加，於讀者和書店老闆都是有益的。</p>
<p>要解決眼前及以後的書籍恐慌，我覺得只有兩個辦法。</p>

所得稅收，數目相當可觀，而直接間接雇傭的人工約達四十二萬五千人之多，次於農業手工業的紡織業而占第三位。大部份林產，也都輸往印度。　　重工業化過程中最需要的　·鈷·鎳·鉛等，緬甸也有相當大的產量。鎢產五千噸，次於我國的一萬二千噸而居世界第二位，鈷產則有獨占的地位，除非洲以外，與加拿大處於相同的地位。在東亞則可占第一位。鎳產爲九百噸，較之加拿大之六萬三千噸和紐卡蘭德尼亞之八千噸，自然相形見絀，但以日本的需要說，幾乎可供給三分之一了。（日本昭和十年以前的需要量爲二千五百至三千噸）。鉛的產量約八萬三千公鐓，可供應英國需要的十分之一以上。這種主要鑛產之最近產額，如下表所示，比之石油·米·木材三種重要物資，在東亞的地位自然較低，但鉛和鎢的產額是有相當重大意義的。　　緬甸主要鑛產表的（單位噸）　　（註）CWT，衡量名，在英國爲一百十二磅，一噸的二十分之一，美國爲一百磅。　　（三）歷史的回憶　　十三世紀中國元朝時代，緬甸附屬中國。以後有時獨立，有時歸附，到了十七世紀，盛淸時代，她便成爲中國的藩邦，十八世紀時，版圖日益擴大，一面伸展到暹羅境內，一面又向孟加拉方面推進。那時英國正在經營印度，對東方各國，野心勃勃，尤其對於中國，也想覬覦，因以，這個介在印華之間的緬甸，便受到英國殖民當局的注目，開始從孟加拉向東蠶食，展開了對緬侵略史。　　嚴格的說，英國侵略頓甸，遠在二百餘年以前，其先驅者還是貿易商人，而支持者則爲東印度公司。英人最初對緬貿易中心地爲馬達班灣與仰光附近各地，由商業的發展，英國人的勢力逐漸深入緬甸。着，緬甸的豐富的鑛物資源，燃紅了英國人的碧眼，開始了侵略的野心。而更進一步，從地理上看，緬甸又是經略後印度。相關中國西南寳庫的最好根據地，於是，在和平的商業活動中，萌芽了英帝國主義野心，漸漸的以有組織的軍國主義的支援，間始併呑緬甸的侵略。經過一八二四，一八五二，一八八五年三次英緬戰爭，便把緬甸「征服」了。　　十九世紀初葉，英人對緬甸的威脅日甚，緬甸爲先發制人計，在一八二四年進攻孟加拉，先後攻陷米那泊，卡察，吉大港等地。英國殖民地當局一面堵絕緬旬軍，另調海陸軍進佔仰光，地那西林等沿海要地。第二年又擊敗緬甸軍六萬人，緬將彭度拉陣亡，英軍遂進至緬京阿瓦（Ava）十五英哩之地。緬王被逼請和，於一八二六年二月二十四日訂「英緬條約」，其內容爲：緬王放棄阿薩密的主權，割阿拉坎，易阿，大佛伊，木廠，地那西林等地與英。從此英人獲得緬甸在孟加拉灣各重要地區，緬王繼續統治的只有上緬甸及下緬甸的庇古及其海口仰光而已。　　一八五二年，英方又籍口緬人仇英，損害英商，派兵由仰光登陸，佔領庇古全境，正式宣吿庇古爲英國屬地，與先前所佔各地合併，成立下緬甸省，直隸於印度政府。那時緬王無力奪回，僅宣言否認。到了十年之後，（一八六二年），英緬復交，也沒有交涉及此，無形中承認庇古歸屬於火了。一八六七年英緬又締曼穗勒條約，恢復一切貿易與外交關係，實際上英國已握全緬於掌心，開始對緬暢所欲爲了。　　一八七八年，緬甸新王提波嗣位，欲藉法全力，阻止英國勢力的發展，同時希望乘英法在後印度的衝突以坐收其利。所以那時緬甸盛行親法，允許法人建築從安南東京直達緬京的鐵道，允許法人在緬設立銀行，開採鑛山，並將許與英人的公司特許狀轉許與法人。英帝國主義就於一八八五年十月二十二日對緬王發出最後通牒，要求將緬甸外交權讓與英印政府辦理。緬王嚴詞拒絕後，英國就派兵侵緬，這年十一月二十八日，攻陷緬京曼德勒，緬王被俘。英人將緬甸現有區域闢爲上緬甸省，直隸印度政府，至於緬甸開始成為英帝國主義的殖民地，這是一八八六年一月一日的事。　　如上所述，緬甸向爲中國西南藩屬，朝言不絕，英國開始呑食緬甸，中國於理有衛護藩屬之戰，可是，淸廷竟不加聞問，反於一八八六年六月二十三日與英締結北京條約，承認英國對緬甸有最高主權，英國也承認緬人得對中國繼續朝貢，實際上緬甸人從此不再向中國朝貢了。</h3>

<p>時事類編復興文化運動  同風　　此次申報月刊微文，以「今日之上海文化界」爲題，承讀者踴躍惠文。因月刊篇幅不多，未能盡取，茲摘選數篇移載木報。　－編者註　　現在戰雲瀰漫着整個世界，所以文化的黯淡低落，是普遍現象。我們上海也曾受過戰爭的洗禮，當然不能例外。但上海素爲中國文化的中心，現在還是這樣，幷且我們上海還負着復興新中國文化的使命，所以復興文化運動是刻不容緩的。　　戰爭是文化的大敵，其破壞性極大，不特破壞，幷且往往將文化拖拉倒退。如最近德國的總力動員，把所有的文化活動統統停止，由此可見戰爭在高熱化的時候，文化就談不到了。但是主持戰爭的還是文化，假使德國沒有極高度的文化，怎能進行這樣大規模的戰爭？至於我們上海雖在戰爭範圍以內，也負着戰爭的使命。但是我們還能抽暇出來做做文化活動。總之，我們有一刻時間，或一分機會，就要從事文化活動，因爲人是無時無刻可以離開文化的，除了極不得巳的時候。　　我們先來檢討形成文化的要素是怎樣？或許能給我們復興文化運動的指示。從歷史上看起來，文化必在優游的生活中萌芽的；如最古的巴比侖和埃及的文化，就是產生在物產豐饒，生活優裕的環境中。再如文化之果必結在自由之花上：如春秋戰國時代之學術思想，以及希臘時代的文化，其發達超越任何時期，其最大原因就是思想自由。最近如中國新文化發源地北京大學，這是世界聞名的學府，當時是蔡元培先生長校，渠聽任敎授與學生自由分派，自保守至極端，皆可獨樹一幟，互爭雄長，渠本人亦參加活動。於是北大爲新文化的搖籃，嗣後逐漸發榮滋長，即形成今日之中國文化。假使當時蔡元培先生，堅持個人成見，擺起校長尊嚴，或排除異己，則新文化運動定受摧殘，能有今日之燦爛嗎？現在我們得到一個結論：就是文化的形成，一定要有優裕的生活，幷日還要有自由的園地。現在我們以這兩種的要素，衡諸上海現狀，就能對症下藥，對於現在的文化復興運動，或能事半而功培。　　上海自戰事發生後，所有文化團體與組織統統瓦解，而許多文化分子也各自星散，有的離滬而自找前途，有的枯守在上海開散着。至於各種刋物無形中自動停止出版，所以上海頓成文化荒的凄凉世界。同時一般文化人被摔在生活高漲的在潮裏，壓得氣也喘不過來，因為他們平日不治生產，在這種紛攘的塲合裏，未免相形見絀。所以終日爲生活奔走，尙不能免凍餒之虞，何暇爲本位努力呢？話雖如此，但還有許多可敬可佩的文化人，挨着飢寒而努力工作。可是這許多人早已爲大衆所忘掉，至多在大衆的腦海裏有一些印象而已。　　雖然還有一二知名之十大聲蜴力呼喊着：救救文化人，可是所得的回響極微。如最近新聞報館所經辦的館穀貸金，第一期由無名氏先生一人承當外，現在第二期業已開始，而經費尙無着落，猶在呼籲捐募中。可是上海的民衆對於慈善事業，頗爲熱心，往往一呼百萬，不足爲奇，何乃區區十餘萬的館穀貸金，竟如是不易集聚，可見一般文化人早巳爲大衆所忘掉了。　　我們要文化復興，非喚起民衆的注意以及扶助不可：幷且文化是寄生在大衆的身上，如無大衆主持，文化何由而產生呢？文化除了大衆扶助外，還需要自由的園地，讓他枝蔓廻旋，纔能發榮滋長，這是上文已經述及。同時把文化種子播種以後，究竟需要多少時候方能開花結果，那是不一定的，往往是前人種樹後人凉。所以我們對於文化之果，不要期望太切，切勿揠田助長，讓他自生自長，只要不時灌漑除草就够了。所以我們希望文化活動中少加政治成分，由民衆自由組織，行政當局能從旁協助、，幷能給以大量自由，則文化之花當可滿布於海上。　　旣如上述，大衆能擁護文化復與運動，而行政當局又能從旁扶掖，則我文化人應格外整飭精神，不能妄自菲薄，且不能如從前那樣坐在象牙塔裏，做自讚自賞的工作，應審度目前環境與世界潮流，幷應痛改以前的頽廢，自大，散漫，妬忌等等惡習，埋頭苦幹，則文化復與，當可預期。華中的液體燃料　油脚煉制汽油代用品　　本文作者日比俊夫氏，爲江北興業公司農務部南通農事試騐塲長，悉心研究以油脚提煉汽油代用品，經年餘之努力，卒吿成功。經過概略，已譯載三月六日本報第四版，茲將日比氏詳細報吿，譯刋於後，祈讀者注意。　－編者註　　近來正是鬧着燃料問題的時代，煤的液化已由加氫法進步到獨特的境域，急速轉入工業化的途徑了。華北有着龐大的煤的埋藏量，所以這個問題不難解決。然而在廣大的華中，則可由別的方向來硏究這個問題，那就是由棉油精製滓以製造液體燃料，由此種植物油的精製滓，約可製得七成的液體燃料。　　研究的動機　　當我赴南通就職的時候，居住南通的一個有識之士，到我的地方來訪，談及由棉油可以製造汽油代用品，說是以前南通農科大學棉作化學科會有這種設施，，關於它的方法，據後來調査所知，並未完成，我於是即存有機會來研究之心。量近因着重油及汽油的配給被限制，各種內燃機船舶的運行，大受阻碍，中國人方面亦對這個問題大爲關心，我遂決定着手研究。　　關於原料　　棉花華中約可出產四百寓擔，而有華中穀倉之稱的江北地方，約出產八十四萬擔的棉花和約五十五萬擔的棉子。這約五十五萬担的棉子，如全部用以榨油，則可製成約五萬五千擔的棉油。實際上僅在江北地方，不能全部用以榨油，大部分則運至上海。全中國約出產棉油〇〇萬噸，大部以供食用爲主，棉油的精製方法，內地使用木炭及棉子殼灰等，普通則用石灰來精製，至於利用燒碱精製之法，則因代價過高，並不採用。　　由石灰精製法而榨出的棉油，色黑而質不純，不能供食用，故必須再加石灰於原油中，攪拌加溫，使生沈澱，以除去其所含雜質。由此而生含有雜質的流滓，一般稱爲石灰精製滓，在中國則稱爲「油脚」。這東西因所含雜質太多，利用價値極少，雖可用作肥皂原料的一部，但因其成分爲脂肪酸的石灰鹽，欲用以製造普通肥皂，非使變成蘇打肥皂或加里肥皂不可，其操作極難，所以只好棄之不用。　　反之，在滿洲國，對於其大宗農產品的大豆，硏究很爲周到，榨油工業固不必說，對於豆油，豆蛋白，以及豆餅等的利用，均硏究無遺，成爲新興大豆工業而活躍着，然而華中大宗農產品的棉子，却尙硏究不足，其油和蛋白質，多被簡單地捨棄，這實在是件非常遺憾的事。　　油脂的用途　　隨着大東亞圈的擴張，南卞的油脂資源也新的加入進來了，尤其是椰子油，一年能出產五百萬噸，其中約有半數可以輸出，所以將來可供日本內地及中國方面的消費。椰子油用以製造肥皂，品質非常優良，若加以精製，可得一種極佳的炸製食品的油。於是如何使華中的棉油餽應於新時代的新用途，就有努力研究的必要。大東亞戰爭發生後，澗滑油的增產，是必然的趨勢，它的四成，除靠油脂資源以取得外，別無他法，所以從油脂資源以製造潤滑油，就成爲一個當前的大問題。　　油脚燃料的沿革　　這個沿革頗饒與味。事變以前，中國煤油的出產，非常貧乏，所以大家考慮到一且有事之際，便須用油脚來代替煤油，於是關於油脚的煤油化之研究，乃盛行於各地的硏究所和大學中，硏究結果，以中央大學的會敎授和天津南開大學應用化學研究所長的杜敎授，功績最著。當地的南通農科大學，當然亦風經硏究，然因這次事變，致吿中賴，新近方得恢復。日本內地亦盛行着魚油的乾餫硏究，據最近京都帝國大學喜多硏究室的發表，說是由洗濯工塲排出的肥皂和有機無機之不純物等所成的混合物中，加入石灰而行乾餾，可得石油狀的物質，其研究已告成功，並且業已證明它的成分和煤油極為近似。　　煉制方法　　我的方法，以價値極賤幾同廢物的油脚（即棉油石灰精製滓）爲原料，加以乾餾，使起分子開裂的作用，由此而得粗製汽油和揮發油，粗製重油，粗製摩比爾油，粗製汽油可供汽油引擎之用，粗製車油則可供內燃機關之用。至於粗製摩比爾油，經行加氫法後，即得潤滑油，又若行高壓加氫法，則可得航空　用的潤滑油，現在正爲此目的而研究中。上述各種物質，都是用油脚提取而得的，如用棉油來提取，則所得的品質自必優良，而操作當然更加簡單。　　先照中國研究所得的方法，用油脚而不加觸媒，把它來乾　，最初四小時內，，加熱二百度，其後五小時　加熱四百度，這樣乾　之後，即得約七成的煤油狀物質，其次又照中國硏究所得的方法，加入酸性白土於油脚中，用同樣方法施行乾餾，亦可製得，惟所需時間很長，不合經濟原則。於是除向來所用的石灰及酸性白土外，更採用三十六種以上的化合物，即：鹼類，鹼土金屬，金屬，重金屬類等的氧化物及鹽，加入油脚之內使起作用，遂發見爲分子量及分子週期律有一定關係的事實，因之而得知道採用何種化合物，即可於短時間內反應完畢，更得知道採用何種化合物而可多得重油或多得輕油，或可多得重合物，結果遂得减短反應時間，收量亦得到若干的增加。　　實用試騐　　於是乃取製得的重油以行實用的試騐。第一次的試騐是在去年五月，當時用裝有二十五匹馬力的內燃機關的船，在揚子江上試騐，得到良好的成績。第二次是在七八月間，亦在揚子江上試騐，所用的船裝有五十匹馬力的內燃機關，試航約十二公里，檢査其油的消費量，引擎的旋轉數，最高速度測定，爆振的有無，烟色的有無，以及點火的難易等，均較市上出售的重油，遜色極少，成績非常良好。當然，若把植物油直接使用於內燃機關，其效率大，經費省，而操作亦簡單；但試作油的製造費，一　大約爲日金五百圓至六百圓之間，比諸現在的重油及植物油，不過其五分之一，故其費用極低。　　油質的改良法　　其後更以改良這種油的性質爲目的，把其成分群細加以分析，發見其中除含有從來所知的成油質及不飽和化合物■芳香質化合物外★更含■■多量的醉類，瞇類★酮類等化合物。何以此時更把這個問題來重新處理呢？這是因爲前次的實騐中，引擎的旋轉數不大，又其點火的難易尙有疑問，故必須明瞭其京因以便改良。這種煤油狀的物質，有須把其還原的必要，其最簡單的方法，就是使其通過於某種觸媒之上。施行這種方法時，其香，色，對於化學藥劑的安定性，以及比重等，均和煤油極相近似。從　對於這種物質，都不施行「後處理」，但我以爲還原操作，是不可沒有的。　　新興油脂工業　　在新興油脂工業上的利益看來，第一是潤滑油的利用，若把乾　油的高沸點物收集起來，充分施行加氫法，似可得到良好的潤滑油。爲此目的，如不用油脚而把植胸油直接應用，亦可製得。第二是製成高級脂肪酸醇以充高級洗濯劑的利用，這最好由棉油出發，若使用油脚，則因其听含雜質太多，且因其本質爲石灰鹽，操作困難，是其缺點。（丁：譯自三月七日大陸新報）日本重要產業概況　　飛機工業　　飛機工業爲近代綜合工業的代表，同時又爲精密工業的最高峰，發動機由幾千種部分品構成，機體則有一萬餘種部分品。又附屬裝置除計測器類，發動機等極精密的機械外，抽氣機，原動機，壓縮機等精密器械，所以飛機工業的特性是最高度的精密工業之綜合。其經營的困難，由日本航空工業界發展的過程可以窺知。日本製造飛機的發韌，在第一次歐洲大戰之前，至於航空機工業之成爲正式體系，則在大戰之後。當時設立的飛機製造會社，因機械工業尙未並行發展，所以部分品有許多不能自給。在此期間，陸海軍在航空機工業的孕育上確盡了最大的努力。　　第一次大戰之後，陸軍命令中島飛機製造會社，海軍命令三菱飛機製造會社，（三菱重工業會社的前身）開始製造飛機，是爲航空機工業發展的嚆矢，之後民間也模倣歐美製造民用機，反之，陸海軍則努力在軍用機的改良上用工夫，常立於指導的地位。　　滿洲專變及中國事變時期，日本航空工業有飛躍的發展。尤其在中國事變中，因陸海軍多年的努力，日本飛機的威力遂得以盡量表見於世界。同時，從事變中所獲的經騐，使航空機工業界更有顯著的進步，完成了大東亞戰爭的準備。陸軍省戰備課長在前年的事變紀念日對飛機工業的發展會說明如次：　　「飛機每年整備的實數，僅就陸軍航空而言，已達事變前的數倍，製造能力的發揮，今日亦已達十倍以上。航空工業發展的前提之精密工業方面，在四年之間，其能力亦達十倍」。　　中國事變勃潑後，政府鑒於飛機的重要性，爲確保斯業的發展，實施二種對策。共一爲飛機工廠的軍管理，其二爲飛機製造事業法的適用。　　軍管理發動於昭和十三年一月（民國廿七年），根據軍需工業動員法，共目的在使陸海軍所需的飛機得以有確實的準備。因此，在軍管理的工廠中，派有軍需監督官與會計監督官，在其監督指導之下，使生產塲所適應軍的需要。實行成本計算，會社經理的監督，使飛機工廠的事業有健全的發展。同法並規定一中規模以上的飛機製造關係會社，須經政府許可，生產設備，事業計劃及技術等，承認政府有統制的權能。同時，對該許可會社免除其所得稅，營業稅，輸入稅。新製成品並給與補助金，保護，獎勵在發展階段上的航空工業。在與列强的航空投術之隔絕中，所期望於日本航空工業的躍進，極爲關懷，終至於今日的成就。　　部分品工業部門，亦因中國事變的進展，新設立的會社很多。同時，生產分野的劃分，工作機械製造事業法的實施，與政府的施策相輔而行，其水準漸趨提高，原料——部分品——完成品的體系漸吿完成，而築成了飛機大量生產的基礎。　　日本飛機工廠經航空機製造事業法許可的會社，計有三菱重工業，中島飛行機，川崎航空工業，愛知時計電機，立川飛行機，川西航空機等十六會社。　　許可會社以外，在飛機發動機部門，有石川島航空工業，三鷹航空工業以至於古河電氣工業，高島屋，飯田，日本高級塗料，東京製鋼，宮田製作所，東京航空計器等二十七會社，製造麻布，棉布，塗料，鋼索，全屬繩，降陸裝置，航空計器等附屬另件。　　這些航空機關係會社，新設的較多，資木的膨脹，很爲急激，在中國事變前後，航空工業發展的過程，至爲顯著。各會社　又相繼增資，似見更趨膨脹，產業界均注目於此。　　如此廣泛的多方面的航空機關係會社，爲適應陸海軍的要求，以期確保飛機的生產，則整頓民間團體，使在一個組織下作一體的活動，絕對是必要的，海軍方面，業已在前年設立海軍工業會，其中包含了許多航空部門。陸軍方面，則在去年十一月二十日設立陸軍航空工業會。　　其組織在本部之下置第一工業會，（機體，發動機，推進器等專門部分品關係。）第二工業會，（鋼鐵材料，非鐵金屬村料，燃料關係。）第三工業會，（計器，光學，無綫電，保安衛生器村，驅動器械，武器關係。）第四工業會，（合作工廠關係。）以三菱重工業會社會鄕古潔氏爲會長，（兼第一工業會部長。）住友金屬會社長春日弘氏任第二工業會長，東京電氣會社長淸水與七郞氏任第二工業會部長，立川飛行機社長橫山虎三郞氏任第四工業會部長。　　陸軍航空工業會的事業爲：　　（一）材料及部分品等的生產，調整並聯絡各製造部門，使能追隨飛機的生產之後。　　（二）關於村料，消耗品等的獲得，互相斡旋通融。　　（三）關於機械設備的獲得，互相通融。　　（四）關於電力，工人等的獲得，配給上，與關係官廳取得聯絡，加以處置。　　（五）硏究，並交換生產技術　　（六）爲適應官方的要求，應對官方的咨詢，實施各種計劃的擬訂，調査。　　（七）謀加强合作工廠統合。　　該工業會爲軍民意志交流的樞紐機關，，極爲活動，在飛機計劃生產的完成上，有極深刻的意義。　　以上是日本飛機生產的現狀。飛機的性能，今尙在發展的過程中，若欲加以改良，使能有日新月異的進步，則現在一方面固然應該大量生產，以適應軍的需要，同時，爲準備未來的決戰，應不斷的從事於科學的技術的研究，此為日本戰時航空工業今後的使命。我們現在作道樣打算，同樣，美國無疑的也在努力製造足以打敗日本的飛機。　　航空機的研究機關，日本原有陸軍的航空技術研究所，海軍的航空技術聯，此外，在遞信省另有中央研究所，至於民間，東京大學，名古屋，九州各帝國大學都設有硏究機關，又在各航空會社中，也從生產的立塲出發，繼續必要的硏究。爲綜合的發揮這些個別的航空技術，使之向上，乃有去年一月技術院的設置，繼於去年五月又設立了大日本航空技術協會。　　技術院促進爲國家目的的有計劃的共同硏究，企圖刷新與列國隔絕之後的日本科學技術。特別注意於擬訂促進航空技術上必要的計劃。大日本技術協會也可算是技術院外圍團體，爲軍官民交換科學技術的聯絡機關，各有各的位置，職務，分担硏究而最後加以合流如此，技術院與技術協會的設置，實現了硏究與生產的統一，對於日本獨有的航空工業之確立，懷着很大的期望。　　造船工業　　製造船舶需要鋼鐵，而鋼鐵的生產則需要鐵與煤。這鐵與煤的運輸，又有賴於船舶。飛機，輕金屬，船舶，鋼鐵，煤五大特種產業，彼此互相關聯，缺一不可。戰局至本年度已屆決戰階段，他種產業，雖應厲行制約，但這幾種重要產業，則不能不有積極的擴充。　　船舶雖然是造船所中造成的，但僅有造船所是不能够造成船舶的，船舶可以說是綜合工業的結晶，它所需要的資材，不能不有求於許多種別的工業。造船工業除其本身外，尙須網羅全部現代工業以爲補助。所以這些工業的生產品，成爲造船能力的主要內容，尤其是鋼材的供給，具有決定的重要性。　　造船上必要的主要資材有鋼鐵，非鐵金屬，木村，織維製品，油漆，水泥，石棉，窰業製品等，假使計算起來，幾與全部產業都有關聯。今就造船的費用上看來，假定重量八千五百噸的貨物船，其造價爲一〇〇，則材料費約占百分之七九，六七。在這材料費中，軟鋼材費占百分之四十六弱。造船雖然要這許多種材料，然大部分則是鐵。造船工事亦可以說是一種結構工事。　　造船工業假使沒有別種關係產業的協力，難有飛躍的增產。於此，重要產業協議會爲謀增强特種嚴業的生產，乃計劃設置生產增强推進協力會，「確立以特種產業爲中心的關聯產業之有機的協力體制，以增强特種產業的生產爲目的。」因爲增强船舶的生產，不能僅賴造船一業的力量，於是乃以造船統制會爲中心，網羅了與此有關聯的各產業統制會，組成協議會，以供應特種產業所需的各種資材。　　該會會長爲造船工業界的權威波孝四郞氏，（前三菱重工業會長）理事長爲預算役海軍中將桑原重治氏。執日本造船業之牛耳者爲三菱重工業會社，在造船造艦設備上，不僅在日本規模最大，即全世界亦在有數之列，其技術的水準亦很高。在昭和十二年度，日本下水的船隻總噸位有四十五萬六千噸，僅次於英國的九十二萬噸，而占世界第二位。遠超美國的二十三萬九千噸之上。（據海事年鑑）所以日本的造船能力，屬於全世界的第一流，同時，其造船技術亦至爲優秀。日本有八千噸至一萬噸的精銳貨物船三十餘艘，裝有平均時速十八海哩的內燃機，就航於太平洋航路，壓倒歐美的先進海運國，即此已足證明日本造船能力的鉅大，以及造船技術的優秀。　　日本的造船業因有軍事的重要性，故在海軍鄭重的育成與保護之下，發達起來。日淸，日俄，第一次歐洲等諸戰役，因戰爭與軍備有息相關的關係，故日本造船業在海軍指導之下，漸趨發展。造船所兼造軍艦於商船的技術，含有軍事的意義，因爲如此可以使商船立刻改裝爲海軍的補助軍艦。政府於去年二月九日首先公佈了「關於管理造船事務的戰時特例之勅令」，把原來在遞信大臣管理下的：　　（一）造船上主要資材之需給調整的權限；　　（二)關於海軍工塲中造船及修繕船舶的監督權。　　在戰時中移交海軍大臣管理，使造船資材與造艦資材得以互相通融,同時，使造船，建艦種計劃出於統g的命令系統，從大局着眼，對此二者加以調整分配。這就是建艦與造船立於同一基礎的起因。首先就資林上觀來，建艦與造船在主要部分完全相同，更因爲艦艇的建造計劃非軍直轄工廠的能力所能應付，當然須利用民間的造船設備。在此情勢下，民間的造船能力，幾成應用之於造船，幾成為應用之於建艦，希望從資材，設備，時期等諸點在統一的命令系統下，請求有效適切的處理。　　上述戰時特令的公佈，卽爲解決的力策。由此，命令系統已　統一，資材的需給亦可調整。但在船舶的大量生產上，造船型式的統一却成了問題。即戰時標凖船型的設定問題　　這不是新近才發生的問題，在第一次歐洲大戰的時候，這標準船型設定了之後，原來建造三千噸的船舶需要七八個月以上者，在大正五年時，二個多月即可以竣工。現在日本已設定了戰時標準船型而進行大量生產。根據船型而分配造船所的指定制度，亦已實施。例如甲型船有〇〇造船所承造，乙型船有〇〇造船所承造，因此，該造船所乃反覆建造同一船型，其能率自然可以增進。這造船所的指定，與船型的統一，乃是一元的造船政策之必不可缺的條件。實施這一元的造船政策之機關爲產業設備營團。即戰時標準船型的建造，一切根據於政府的造船計劃，由該營團咨照各個造船所，使其所建造的船舶，維持國家所必要的數量。營團把船舶交民間造船所承造的時候，「營團所蒙的損失，由政府補償之，」關於建造及讓與的價格，由政府決定之。」例如政府規定建造的基準價格、新船造價）每噸爲五百五十圓，官賣船價（採算價格）爲三白三十圓。營團用五百五十圓一噸的代價建造新船，由其交付與民間的材料則作公定價三百五十圓，營團當然每噸不足二百圓，這損失由政府補償之。　　政府一方負担一部分上述的新船造價，同時並補給建造船舶的資金通融，並改正損失補償法，每一次資金的通融由三分之一增至五分之四。　　（一）其適用範圍，由四千總噸的舶减低至小型的戰時標準型船舶，擴大其適用的範圍　　（二）同時對金融機關資金的通融，補償其損失。　　除以上技術的金融的施策之外，造船，造機之積極的擴充，則由產業設備營團任其責。因爲造船業是綜合的工業，所以在造船能力上很受阻碍　祗要其種部分品偶一遲延，其他全部資材雖已備齊，但不能不等待某種遲延的部分品完成後始再進行。勞働者的不足，資材的不足，當然切望早日解決，而資材部分品的配給尤爲首先應予解決的問題。極單純化的格式，與分業　的確立，爲今後飛躍的增進造船能力之唯一條件。（翔：譯自二月二十七·八日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>自由談「三八」談婦女  銘君　　遠在幾千年前，婦女們也有過「赫赫一世的時代——女權時代，她們一切地位，體力，智慧並不有遜於男子們的。部落，家族一切以母系爲單位，兒女不認識父親是常有的事。相傳耕種是由女子發明的，有孕的女子們不能長途跋涉地跟男子們去牧獵，只得權住在家裏，有時他們長時期的不回家，生理上受着限制的婦女，可能處於飢饉地步：這才發明了耕種。　　不勝滄桑地，我們今天的地位，實際上只是男子的附庸。在社會上，終不能與男子們有着「並駕齊驅」的地位，現在所謂高唱入　的男女一律平等——像職業地位平等之類，在實際上到底能够做到幾分之幾？一班御用的女職員祇不過是點綴昇平，在產業領域裏並未成爲主力，其甚焉者，在一些社會性的目光光裏不免有「花瓶」之誚，它底「製造者」倒規　了責任；其實在一切的社會事業部門中，像敎員，醫生，護士，——她們的社會功勳都給誰淹沒了呢？其他像低層則女性勤勞份子更沒有生活的意義可說。研究讀寫的時間都沒有。即使她們求得一些自己學習來的知識，也很容易忘記；因爲她們沒有可以應用這些知識的機會。　　由說在家庭裏吧，更處於「不是勞動的同伴，而是浪費的同伴」的地位。家務的煩重，孩子的牽累，只有使她們愚蠢，頑固，有閒與宿命。邀幾個前樓阿姨，亭子間嫂嫂來上幾圈馬將」，「恣意尋樂」地去解決幾日來深鎖着的愁悶，苦痛，直弄個「頭昏眼花」「勞神傷財」。吾則儘嚷着那個男人好，那張片子妙。　　另一面，再講黃金時代」的她們，即學生時代的她們，無時不憧憬着將來的美麗的高傲的希望，像一頭美麗的小鳥飛向　遠，高闊，蔚藍的天空。她們有時想着開闢一條自己要走的路。她們盡向書本上我着自己切求着的知識，並自由的泉源。她們聞出了家的陳腐的空氣，使她們惡心地窒息，她們厭惡，嫉恨，詛咒這家，開始作擺晚，衝破這樊籠的企求；像急流裏的浮萍似的冲出去，但，黑暗的魔鬼煽起翅膀，到處都在翱翱着等待你，「娜拉奔出了家庭」向何處去？在外邊儘多着像你一樣的人，走　了整個世界，苦着臉，虛空而失神地奔走着，但有着的只是操着「擠眉弄眼」「嘻嘻哈哈」的位置，吾則你必須重新走回家去，像希臘神話中的女郞Hero被Venus幽禁在孤寂的塔中一樣，不能自主地跑動一步。日久馴成了像「神女賦」裏所說的一旣姽嬇於幽靜兮，又婆娑乎人間」的那種女性。　　難道她們正如猶太人的祈禱書裏，有一句簡短的，厲害的，可是對於婦女很不恭維的禱吿文：「謝謝你，上帝，沒有叫我做女人」那樣一錢不値地被卑視，凌辱嗎？不，決不，「女模時代」就可吿訴你。（雖然並不需要像那時的地位，至少也須跟男子站在同一的地位）我們須要認淸目標，別錯認逃出了家門，外邊就是康莊大道，一切自由，幸福正排着隊恭候着你。再者愁悶，苦痛並不會平白地飛進你的軀殼，正因爲有產生它們的泉源在着，你必須用着靈敏的感覺，理會這現象是從何而來的，再咬緊牙齒——，之之，用消極，宿命，浪蕩等東西是永遠塡塞不了那愁悶，苦痛的泉源的。　　了解現實，把握現實，才是改變現實最有效騐的良藥。用　　　粥的積極精神探求知識並與緊張嚴　的生活配合，反對永遠保守在你們的祖母，會祖母那樣的地位，必須走向新生命之路——到達與男子們同等的地位。上意下達：下意上達  史新　　我認爲……　　日本是「國家的」底，而中國是「社會的」底。因此，日本可以「從上而下」，中國却需要「從下而上」。上意下達適用日本，下意上達適用於中國。如果爲政者顚倒其事，那就等於大海搜針，一切措施只有心勞而已。評「結婚進行曲」  悄珂　　編劇：陳白塵　　導演：章杰　　演出者：上海聯藝劇團　　一·劇本和演出方式　　這是一齣針對現社會中靑年們戀愛與生活之矛盾的五幕悲喜劇。　　在全劇五慕之間，很顯明的劃出一條鴻溝，前三幕傾向於諷刺式的喜劇，而後兩幕則接近寫實的悲劇。在這兒，作者指出靑年們走入社會以後，身受的「現實生活」和他們一向憧憬着的「理想生活有着多麼大的距離！　　的確，目下有着多少知識女性，她們渴望着獨立，渴望着平等與自由：可是，人當然跳不出戀愛的圈子：於是，結婚了，生孩子了，終於　壓在家庭裏勉强地做一個不熟練的賢妻良母，種種現實的壓迫粉碎了她們年靑　美夢：在無可奈何之中，劇作者提出了一個社會問題——都市中托兒所的設置。　　無可諱言地：作者在寫這劇本時，很受了兩個劇本的影響——「是丁西林的壓迫」，一是石華父的「職　婦女」。前者描寫二房東不肯租房子給沒有家眷的單身男女，後者諷刺各機關不收留已婚的女職員。本劇在描述劉天野和黃瑛的到處碰壁時，特別强調這兩點。　　在編劇的技巧上，陳白塵依然保持他詼諧而俏皮的筆調；特別値得一提的是第三幕將閉時周經理逐走黃瑛後命令茶房另買一束新的鮮花，襯托他另選一個新的女秘書，頗有含蓄。還有，全劇告終時劉天野握拳對着垂頭倦坐爐旁的黃瑛，正將打下去時，却突然一個轉變，感慨地垂下手臂嘆息着說：「她也實在太苦了。」這一個優美而回味盎然的結束表現了作者一貫的詩人氣質。　　二·導演的處理　　我相信本劇導演章杰不但熟諳舞臺，而且也是富有才能的。試觀本劇前三慕輕鬆活潑的處理，和後二慕沉重感傷的開展，就知道他對於演出的空氣與情緒把握得很牢。並且，第四慕中王科長的再出現和第五幕中奶媽的大搖大擺也穿揷得生動而不太過份，未致影響本幕應有的情調，是値得讚美的。舞臺上角色地位的流動頗靈活，節奏的快慢也甚恰切，司是，對於各個演員對白的快慢和語氣，有些地方似乎不够精細以致間或有臺詞快到第二排的觀衆來不及聽淸楚的毛病。　　導演自謙地說他對於這劇本的處理、但求無過」並且說明他對於本劇的前三慕不把它排成。“Farce”這種態度和見解是正確的。不過，在演出時看起來，前三幕仍有近似“Farce”的作風，是否演員過度的發展我當然不敢妄測，我只有這樣一個感覺，如能一貫地處理得更寫實些，使它們和後兩幕的作風上更一貫，也許會使觀衆的印象更深刻些。　　三·演員的表現　　在演技上，有兩個値得特書的。劉基的王科長和陳述的楊主任。　　劉基刻劃一個好色而又自命風雅的王科長，不但唯妙唯肖，而且典型恰切。楊主任是、出塲就是連串的笑，每言必笑，一直笑到終塲，笑得那麽自然，刻劃出一個逢迎上司和顏悅色的假好人：尤其是看婚書用印時遠視眼鏡的特寫，生動而自然。　　飾劉天野的異方不愧是一僩多方面的優秀演員。這裏飾着倔强活潑的摩登少年，國語純熟，演技精湛。　　演黃瑛的陳璐在典型的刻劃上大體是成功的；她表現了倔强，大胆，聰明與自信，演技已有顯然的進步。但是國語仍嫌不純熟。　　田振華的奶媽雖祇有一塲戲，演來却頗見精采，尤其是她那一口帶有鄕土味的北京話和洋洋自得的神情，頗能引人入勝。　　李宗善的劉母演來頗有力量，可惜聲詞過高，說話過快，動作也太年靑些。英郁的黃父大體不差，走路太輕飄些。立風的老頭兒神情好，口音不純粹。向沉的周經理很努力，表演得很有風度，但是動作多少有些機械化，未能圓穩。海濤的方太太表現的人物典型很恰切。　　四·舞台技術方面　　各部門舞台工作大致完善。舞台裝置以第三幕最爲漂亮，和燈光的配合亦佳。第四幕窗的格子頗秀美。第五慕雖然和第一慕同景，但牆壁間加上了些汚投之處，足見負責之是非常細心而認眞工作着的。設計者利用金都淺而寬廣的舞台在第一二兩景中搭出明顯的大門，是其頗有匠心之處。　　兩次燈光的轉暗協助演出氣氛小少。　　服裝效果都還可以，化裝略嫌粗疏些。　　五·幾個槪括的印象　　喜劇的發展上有兩塲十分成功的戲。第二幕先是黃瑛躲在沙發裏，用被窩蒙着頭：繼而劉天野如法泡製；終於兩個人一齊躱在沙發裏，這一個噱頭連用三次而不嫌其重複，頗爲可愛。還有第三幕中黃瑛向周經理申述自己要結婚，意欲請周作證婚人，周却誤會了黃是要同自己結婚，弄得騎虎難下；這一段不但諷刺得生動深刻，而且有許多雙關巧合的對白也輕鬆之至。　　第五幕黃瑛在悲傷的情緒下，聽見大門外有一對靑年走過，歡唱着自己和天野當年唱過的進行曲，情調極佳，含蓄也豐富。　　小毛病也有幾個：例如第二慕的佈景在那間屋子和大門外間隔的地方，應當是視作有着一道牆的；不過這牆在舞台上是虛的，假想的，不便實際搭出來。那未室中的人物應當注意不要把自己的身軀趨過這道牆。　　有幾個演員的動作太零碎，並且有笑塲的危險，不得不加以注意。　　一般地說起來，整個演出長成功的，並且値得一看；因爲，這是一個很普遍而又十分嚴重的社會問題。根  辛波　　一個年輕的當差，走了進來，到火盆旁邊，從簍子裏取出了幾塊炭，添到盆裏去。添好後，他又取下鐵架上的銅壺，到炕幾上茶杯裏去冲了水，同轉身來，也爲兪篤周冲了水。一眼看見薛鳳春的茶杯空着，他就取過來，冲了水，送給根明。　　「得罪得罪，阿五。」根明立起來謙　着。　　「大根哥的病怎樣了？」阿五問。　　「還不是那樣輕二天重三天！大家都說是傷寒症…」引起了他的心事，自然份外焦慮地說着。　　「阿五，你點了燈龍去找找那個酒鬼看，」揚子傑聽根明說了一會，終於這樣吩咐着。　　「也好，阿五，你就去一下。」黃崇菴同意了。　　「阿五，阿五，拿些開水來！」有淑的聲音。　　「來了來了！」阿五沒口子應着，提着銅壺奔了過去。　　寂靜又一度統治了書房，因爲黃崇菴的心緒，很不安寗，沒有心思開口，只是吸水烟。，楊子傑和兪篤胤的心理，則爲了保長的久等小來，有一覺得無聊，一時也就少了話；至於根明更是一肚皮的心事，旣恨田價不能再多些，又急於要回去，那裏還有話說。　　「小鬼，你越養越刁了！」對而在逐漸低下去的嗡嗡聲中，突然爆出了這樣的話。這是有淑的聲音。「飯不要吃，粥不要吃，偏要吃開水淘飯；冷些不好，熱些不好，偏要不冷不熱的；誰知道你的不冷不熱，却潑得我一手，燙得我這樣痛，……總沒有看見像你的，將來只配餓殺！」　　「你要我餓殺，你要我餓殺，好，我就不吃，嘔嘔，……」又哭起來了，接着，地上發出了筷子撒拉拉的聲音。「我就不吃，嘔嘔，……」　　「有功弟，快不要，」薛鳳春在勸着，口氣中透出了掙折的意味，似乎在拉着有功的手，不聽他再砸其他的碗盞。（六）社會服務為福幼院難童呼籲  黃警頑　　社會救濟工作，原是一樁極艱難又極繁重的事業，必須用大規模有組縱的集體行動來推進，方能發生效果。上海是個充滿着尖銳矛盾的，號稱「東方支加哥」的大都市，在這樣的都市裏，貧窮，流浪，失業，犯罪……等等現象的發生，是無可避免的事。這中間，兒童也佔了它的大部份。對於這班兒童，最適當而且合理的處置辦法，要算是創辦難童敎養院了。　　一年以前，我們發起一福幼院一，肩起了這種艱苦的責任，專門幹　貧苦兒童的救濟工作：凡是街頭流浪的丐童迷途羔羊的苦兒或　貧孩子，勞動人家無力養育的子女等等，都是我們的工作目標和對象：此外，難民收容所裏的孤兒，和工部局兒童保障科及申新二報保送過來的貧苦兒童，我們也一視同仁地收留。現在這些可憐的孩子，我們這兒就有二百餘名之多。我們除授與他們生活上必要的知識外，並注意鍛鍊他們的生產技術，擬定每半年使他們學成一種技能，給他們日後自立謀生前途打下一道深深的基礎。　　可是，最嚴重的問題，是一般生活費的高漲，在這現象之下，我們自然也無可逃避地遭逢到空前的威脅。我們這個「福幼院」，向來是沒有什麽基金的。平時院中所有開支的唯一來源，無疑地，是由許多熱烈心腸者的賜予；因了這種熱情的賜予，曾使那許多天眞無邪的貧苦無依的小天使們的臉頰上露出莫可名狀的笑容來，也就是對賜予他們同情者的「感謝」答復。我們爲了要使這許多可憐無吿的小天使們的臉頰上永遠地堆着笑容，同時也給我們的民族留下許多許多種子起見，所以我們如今不能不代那許多難童，向那已有和未來的許許多多具着熱烈心腸者仲出手掌來。再則，我們這次的「徵慕難童教養經費運動」，目的是籌集四十萬元，來救濟這般難童，預定從開始直到結束，時間是很短促的。。也是表示「福幼院」裏留養着的二百餘名難童，需要救濟的急切呵！所以這次的事，還得希望許多社會上的熱心人士，踴躍輸將，使我們這次的計劃早日完成。我們當代那許多名難童向大家到深切誠摯的感謝。義務學校彙誌　　（一）上海新聞採訪習成址，現已開始第二期招生，凡本報受助學生及執有本報淸寒證件者，均可申請半費，章　向該校函　即寄。辦公虐愛多亞路浦東大樓五〇一號。　　（二）上海醫學書局爲培植醫學人才起見，特舉辦新醫免費指導社，由丁福保殷綏和

<h3>Women's Day Message</h3>
<p>Every year on this day, women celebrate their own festival. My sisters across the nation must also have fervent emotions today. Looking back on the past and forward to the future, there should be endless emotions and great hopes. However, Chinese women today should celebrate their festival with even greater significance, because we are at war, and a new mission is bestowed upon every educated woman. We must take it upon ourselves.</p>
<p>Wartime women should be the most important determining force for national victory. Whether it is Japan, Germany, or the Soviet Union, the women of these countries have already been ________ for their country's war, replacing men on farms, in factories, and in transportation agencies to shoulder important tasks. They go to the front lines to offer comfort, they prepare spiritual and material comforts for the soldiers at the front, and they work to maintain stability in the rear, to relieve refugees, to educate orphans, to assist in air defense, and to maintain public order. They are active on the front lines and in the rear, as brave as men, and even more worthy of boasting about than men: their hard work, patience, and law-abiding spirit. But, looking back at the women of our country, what about them? It goes without saying for the generally ignorant and unknowledgeable. Even among those who have received higher education, some are active on the political stage, but their purpose is only to use their political position to satisfy their own desire for wealth and honor. How many men do things that harm the country and the people in order to satisfy their wives' endless desires? How many men create social evils because of women's excessive extravagance? Today, we should address this phenomenon and appeal to educated women to lead by example. Negatively, they should not do things that harm social customs and hinder national policies, such as extravagance and waste. On the other hand, they should actively rise up, call on women across the country to participate in wartime work, participate in wartime social welfare undertakings, and promote the movement of women serving the country. Looking at the facts of the women's circles in Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union fighting for their countries, can we not strive to become stronger?</p>
<p>Secondly, we want to solemnly point out that, apart from the extremely small number of intellectual women in the upper class and the wealthy and noble women in the upper echelons, the vast majority of women in our country are in a state of ignorance and are suffering from hunger and cold. We hope that women's groups across the country will cooperate closely to promote several major events that are urgently needed at present: First, is the expanded relief movement for women in poverty and illness, which is also the relief movement for the motherhood of the next generation of our Chinese nation. Women's charitable organizations should strive to make their institutions more sound and developed. Hospitals, obstetrics hospitals, etc., should have special preferential measures for poor women, and strive for their universality and practicality. Second, we further expect the government and the social system to cooperate closely to set up more free maternity hospitals and nurseries, etc., to relieve the domestic shackles of ordinary women, so that they can devote more strength to society and the country. Third, we call on the authorities and various factories, companies, and stores to give preferential treatment and protection to female workers and female employees. Fourth, we hope for the development of general women's education, especially the universal development of literacy education for the common people, supplementary education for adult women, wartime service education for women, and vocational education for women. Whether as housewives or preparing to serve society and the country, women of the new era must have literacy, newspaper reading, writing, and a skill necessary to maintain life. Moreover, the work in the rear during the war and the construction of the new country during the war are still waiting for our women's circles to work hard together with men.</p>
<p>Awake, Chinese women! Arise, invigorate and unite, new Chinese women! The future of the new China requires the cooperative struggle of more than 200 million women!</p>
<p>Commentary and Translation</p>
<h3>Germany's Submarine Offensive and Defensive War Against Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>According to a special communique from the German High Command on the 26th, in February, the German submarine fleet sank 80 enemy ships, totaling 534,300 tons. This shows the failure of the anti-submarine warfare that Britain and the United States have been anxious about since last December. If this situation continues, the food problem in Britain itself, the problem of assisting the Soviet Union, not to mention, even the Allied landing operation in Europe will inevitably have a very serious adverse effect.</p>
<p>On January 30, the promotion of submarine fleet commander Admiral Karl Dönitz to commander-in-chief of the German Navy was proof that Germany focused on submarines in the ocean. On February 5, according to a statement by US Navy Secretary Knox, Germany builds one submarine every day, and he admitted that this shipbuilding rate is higher than the rate at which British and American ships are sunk by German submarines. Navy Secretary Knox also said that the number of German submarines operating in the Atlantic Ocean is now higher than in June last year. Moreover, in addition to the increase in quantity, the performance of German submarines has also been significantly improved. The use of submarine oil tankers, submarine depot ships, etc., and new tactics in patrolling, detecting enemies, and attacking, especially the use of group submarines in combat, have further increased the power of German submarines. In response, the British and American sides have used methods such as strengthening escort warships, improving the specific defensive equipment of escorted ships, and continuing to bomb German shipyards and bases. However, based on the fact that the German submarine record in January and February was not inferior to that of last December, the efforts of Britain and the United States have not had any effect. Since the previous escort system could not fulfill its mission, many people proposed increasing the speed of transport ships from the current 11 knots to 15 or 17 knots. However, even if the speed is increased by 4 knots, not only are there various inconveniences in shipbuilding and many disadvantages in cargo tonnage, even if these problems are solved, there are still many _______ points for the high speed of the latest submarine's surface speed of 23 knots. Even if Britain and the United States build many ships and send the escort system to the above-mentioned level, under the current situation of being sunk in large quantities on the seabed, they will ultimately fail to make a significant change in the situation.</p>
<p>When the British and Americans send large armies to the European continent, assuming that each soldier needs a ship of several tons, then _______ soldiers are expected to require 8 million tons. Britain and the United States do not have this capability now, so from this point alone, the position currently occupied by Germany and Italy on the European continent cannot be easily shaken. In other words, submarine warfare can both control Britain's lifeline and protect the weapons of continental Europe. (翔: Translated from the February 28 Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Axis Forces Launch Offensives at Both Ends of Tunisia Fierce Battles Unfold East of the Mareth Line British Forces Withdraw from Settanane</h3>
<p>German Führer's Headquarters, Havas News Agency, 7th. This afternoon's military communique stated that on the southern Tunisian front, German and Italian forces are engaging the enemy in the battlefield, and have gained the upper hand.</p>
<p>Rome, Havas News Agency, 7th. The Italian High Command issued a war report today stating that in yesterday's Tunisian theater, Italian forces shot down five enemy aircraft in air combat, and destroyed many enemy aircraft in surprise attacks. Enemy tanks and armories were hit in the surprise attacks. Yesterday there was only positional warfare on the Tunisian front.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Allied News Agency, 7th. According to Allied news from the Tunisian front received here last night, the British First Army led by General Anderson has been retreating 12 kilometers along the main coastal highway towards Tamoura, unable to withstand the pressure of the German forces under General Arnim in northern Tunisia. At the same time, news from the Allied Forces HQ in North Africa said that German General Rommel in southern Tunisia launched a large-scale offensive against the British Eighth Army led by General Montgomery in front of the Mareth Line. However, this news has not been confirmed by the Axis powers, nor is its detail is known. Earlier news only said that both sides were continuing to assemble large armies in this area, and that patrol and artillery activity had increased significantly on Friday. Regarding the British retreat in northern Tunisia, a Reuters correspondent stationed at General Eisenhower's headquarters cabled that British forces were forced to withdraw after fierce street fighting in the village of Settanane (20 kilometers south of the coast and about 40 kilometers west of Mateur). The British First Army in the coastal area has now retreated to Tamoura, which is easier to defend than Settanane. The Reuters correspondent also warned that if the military continued to advance 10 kilometers in this area, it would reach Kiff el Apirot. If the German army occupied this mountain, it could control the important road from Tabarka to Beja (100 kilometers west of Tunis). According to news from Berlin, the German army won a victory in the Settanane area and was able to reach the area southwest of Cape Serrat (70 kilometers west of Bizerte). Before the British army withdrew westward, the German army defeated the many with the few, and the battle was particularly fierce. German anti-tank guns destroyed three tanks, and the remaining British tanks led the British infantry in a hasty retreat. To the south of the Settanane area, General Arnim led his troops on Friday to attack on the road from Mateur to Beja, launching a surprise attack on the outskirts of Medjez el Bab (50 kilometers southwest of Tunis). Today, British and German artillery are still on the east side of the area, shelling each other across the stream. American troops in southeastern Tunisia mistakenly entered a minefield laid by Axis forces before their retreat, suffering heavy casualties. The minefield greatly hindered Allied movements. American troops are currently moving slowly and cautiously between Kasserine and Faiid.</p>
<p>Bern, Havas News Agency, 6th. It is learned that General Rommel's troops launched a fierce attack on the British Eighth Army near the Mareth Line in southern Tunisia. The offensive began at dawn and was attended by a large number of tanks. The details are not yet known. The Allied High Command announced today that in the central Tunisian route, Allied forces occupied the city of Pison, 30 miles southwest of Kairouan, but also admitted that Allied forces had abandoned the city of Settanane. In addition, General Armin's troops continued to advance along the Mateur-Béja railway, attempting to occupy the Béja-Tabarka area. Tabarka is the only port between the port of Bizerte and the Algerian border, so it is extremely important.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Havas News Agency, 7th. A Reuters correspondent stationed at the Allied Forces Headquarters in North Africa cabled that General Rommel mobilized tanks and infantry and launched an offensive against the British Eighth Army at dawn yesterday. Fierce battles are now underway.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Havas News Agency, 7th. London telegram. The offensive launched by General Rommel south of the Mareth front line has greatly shocked the British people. Although the newspapers admit that there are a large number of German tanks attacking, they still want to make readers think that it is not worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency, 7th. Rommel's army suddenly launched a fierce offensive against the British Eighth Army on the 6th. According to a cable from Algiers, the two armies ______ launched a fierce battle 62 miles east of _______ . German mechanized units are constantly attacking the enemy.</p>
<h3>New Offensive by Japanese Forces in China Has Achieved its Wartime Objectives - Asahi Shimbun Commentary</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Allied News Agency, 7th. The Asahi Shimbun commented on the new offensive by Japanese forces on the Chinese mainland, saying that the Imperial Army had defeated enemy forces in northern Jiangsu and the Hankou area within half a month and had achieved its wartime objectives. The area north of the Yangtze River between Yuezhou and Shashi, which is controlled by the Japanese army, is a rich agricultural area and has become a strategically and economically important location. At the same time, controlling the Yangtze River between Yuezhou and Yichang can prevent Chongqing from replenishing its combat power and allow the Japanese army to obtain various supplies. Once these areas are occupied, the unfinished roads abandoned by Chongqing before the war can be completed, and the exchange of materials between Central and North China will be smooth. Sino-Japanese cooperation and maintaining stability are prerequisites for managing these newly occupied areas. In recent battles, the Chinese National Government has shown its spirit of cooperation through its actions, and the residents of the war zone have given the Japanese army their full cooperation. This is a confirmation that the people are now breaking away from Chongqing's constraints in China. As the peaceful areas gradually expand, the Chongqing forces in each area will inevitably be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in North China - February War Situation</h3>
<p>Beijing, Central News Agency, 7th. The Japanese Army in North China today released the main combat situation in February as follows: The Chongqing army in North China took advantage of the attempt to counterattack on the Burma front to repeatedly try to harass the peaceful areas, but the Japanese army had long been waiting in strong positions and would never allow it to move rashly. Moreover, because of the Japanese army's spring offensive operations, it has been in a state of shock and panic. After several rash actions, due to the Japanese army's serious vigilance and continuous active suppression, its attempts have been crushed. The entire revitalized North China is now carrying out a two-pronged operation with unwavering spirit. In particular, the recent activities of the Security Army and other armed groups devoted to the peace movement have made a great contribution to the suppression and construction of North China. A summary of the main combat situation in February is as follows: Since June last year, when Hebei Province was designated as a special administrative region, it has been actively engaged in establishing security work. With the efforts of the North China Political Affairs Commission, the Jizhong Plain has established a new posture. On the Shandong Province front, the Japanese army's operations against the Chongqing and Communist armies in the Wuding Zhou Tong area north of the old Yellow River in northern Shandong have become increasingly fierce since February, and are expanding their attacks. In addition to annihilating the Chongqing 337th Brigade south of Huangxian in southern Shandong, the Japanese army also annihilated the Chongqing 113th Division and the Second Advanced Detachment of Li Wenti in Peichang (55 kilometers northeast of Yishui) in the mountainous area of central Shandong in mid-February, capturing its division commander Han Zigan Li Wenti and killing many other cadres. In this battle, the Chongqing army abandoned its corpses and those captured amounted to more than 2,000. In the Hanji area (70 kilometers north of Guide) in western Shandong, about 3,000 members of the Communist Army's 7th Training Brigade were defeated. On the Henan Province front, in mid-February, Japanese army units in the southeast of Maliangji (18 kilometers northwest of Dangshan) repelled and inflicted a devastating blow on the Chongqing 5th Ninety-second Army, which attempted to go north. On the Shanxi Province front, in late January, Japanese army units annihilated the Chongqing Army 18th Group Army's 1st sub-district army in Qinyuan, killing its deputy commander.</p>

<h3>Xu Liang Arrives in Beijing</h3>
<p>Beijing, Allied News Agency, 7th. Xu Liang, the Chinese ambassador to Japan, went to Nanjing to discuss with his government and said here yesterday that China should cooperate closely with Japan to show its appreciation for Japan's unchanging policy of maintaining extremely friendly relations with China, as shown by Japan's abolition of extraterritorial rights in China. Japan is now devoting all its efforts to bring the Greater East Asia War to a successful conclusion and hopes that China and Japan will act in unison and fight to bring the current war to a victorious end. If China wants to win the war, it must have unity in the government and the people and an inseparable unity with Japan, and Chinese youth should be given thorough training.</p>
<h3>Prosperity Restored to Guangzhou Bay and the Leizhou Peninsula</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, Central News Agency, 6th. It has been two weeks since the Japanese army was stationed in Guangzhou Bay. Chinese residents have been able to recognize the true intentions of the Japanese army and see through Chongqing's false propaganda. At the same time, they can live and work in peace under the protection of the Japanese army. According to someone who recently arrived in Hong Kong from Xiying, Guangzhou Bay, the situation in Guangzhou Bay and the Leizhou Peninsula after the Japanese army moved in is as follows: After the Japanese army entered Cunjin Bridge, public order in the city was immediately restored. The number of residents returning to Chikan and Cunjin Bridge is increasing day by day. Entertainment venues such as cinemas and wine shops are as prosperous as before. Prices in the leased area have risen slightly due to a shortage of daily necessities and food, but they have now fallen back. On the Leizhou Peninsula, security has also been rapidly restored after the Japanese army landed. Residents are assisting the Japanese army in efforts to restore the area. 95% of the residents in Leizhou City have moved back. The residents of Suixi have also returned one after another. Markets began trading on the 24th and 25th. Xiying was even more prosperous before. The people of Chikan Xiying dispatched personnel to various peaceful areas to work hard to maintain the trade in Guangzhou Bay, so the commerce there is thriving.</p>
<h3>English Courses in North China Schools Changed to Electives</h3>
<p>Beijing, Havas News Agency, 7th. A decree was promulgated here stipulating that from April 1, all middle schools and commercial schools in North China must teach European languages for two years, but English has been changed to an elective course. Students can stop learning European languages after completing one European language.</p>
<h3>Trainees of the Third Phase of the Sino-Youth Cadre School Enlisted and Formed into Squads This Morning</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 7th. The new students who passed the preliminary examinations in various regions for the third phase of the Sino-Youth Cadre School reported on the 6th.

According to the person in charge of the school, the training time for the third phase will be one week longer than the second phase, so as to participate in the Capital Youth General Review. The training courses are roughly the same as the second phase, but the military training course is becoming increasingly strict.</p>
<h3>New York Magazine Publishes Letter from Lin Yutang Revealing Very Few Supplies to Chongqing - It Will Become Increasingly Difficult if They Do Not Quickly Seek to Increase</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Central News Agency, 7th. The recent American weekly magazine "Republic" published an open letter from Lin Yutang to a New York evening newspaper, which exposed Chongqing's embarrassment. It said that although Chongqing had requested 100 transport planes from the United States at the beginning of 1942, only 40 actually arrived in Chongqing. However, 25 of them were detained in India en route. After several months of serious protests, they were shipped to Chongqing. At present, the aid to Chongqing is very small, and the amount is only 1% of that transported by the Burma Road. If the increase in transport volume is not quickly sought in the future, the transport obstruction in Chongqing will inevitably become increasingly difficult for the war against Japan. Moreover, Japan is also taking advantage of Chongqing's current poverty to attempt to attack. If the anti-Axis forces do not quickly find a way to help Chongqing, the connections of both land and air routes will be cut off by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Lacks Food</h3>
<p>Macau, Central News Agency, 7th. According to Chongqing news, the Chongqing Food Department is now feeling the difficulty in coping with military food. Although it has implemented conscription, the fundamental problem is still insufficient production, which has created the current food panic. The food obtained by the Chongqing government through conscription from farmers each month can only sustain the military food supply for five days. The rest is either purchased or people are mobilized to donate food or other methods are used, but it is still felt to be insufficient, resulting in a lack of military food in some areas for more than seven days. As a result, the troops have been forcibly conscripting food locally, which has caused great resentment among the people. Therefore, Chongqing once ordered the troops to implement a food rationing plan, two bowls of porridge and one meal a day, which almost led to a mutiny. Therefore, the Chongqing Food Department feels extremely helpless in coping with this food problem. The severity of Chongqing's food problem can also be seen.</p>

<h3>The Battle for Various Lines on the Eastern Front Continues; The Situation in Western Caucasus Gradually Becomes Active</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from the German Headquarters, 7th: The German High Command announced today in its war report that the Soviet forces attacking on the Eastern Front yesterday were all repelled and suffered heavy losses. The German Air Force and its allied air forces expanded their operations and achieved great results. Only positional warfare occurred yesterday along the Kuban River and the Donets Front. German tank units inflicted heavy damage on the Soviet forces and captured hundreds. South of Kharkiv, German mechanized units broke through strong Soviet resistance, forcing them to retreat north. The Soviet Third Tank Brigade, Cavalry Brigade, and infantry units, which were surrounded by German forces, were defeated, and countless Soviet soldiers were captured. The Soviet forces attempted to launch attacks from various strongholds, but all attempts failed. In Stanislaviv, Soviet forces briefly penetrated our strong positions but were quickly driven back and suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 7th: The battle for control of the Eastern Front continued yesterday. The Soviet forces suffered heavy casualties in various war zones without any achievements. German mechanized units south of Kharkiv broke through strong enemy resistance, defeated a brigade, and chased them northward. In the battles south of Kharkiv, nine Soviet tanks were destroyed. In the past two days in the Stanislaviv area, another twenty-eight Soviet tanks were destroyed. The Soviet 15th Tank Division and cavalry unit south of Kharkiv have been surrounded for several days and have been repelled. The Germans captured 225 artillery pieces, 61 tanks, 382 machine guns, and countless spare parts.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Dispatch from Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 7th: In the past 24 hours, there have been no major developments on the Eastern Front. In the Caucasus, German forces are still holding the Novorossiysk base. The Soviet offensive south of the Kuban River stronghold has subsided. However, the Soviet side is significantly mobilizing troops in the North Caucasus, and it is expected that the Soviet army will attack again. The fighting in the Rostov and Taganrog areas has also subsided due to thawing. In the Donets River basin, German forces are still clearing out the remaining enemy. West of Kharkiv, the situation is relatively quiet, but in the Orel area, Soviet forces are attacking on three fronts. One route is advancing from the south along the Kursk and Orel line, and the other two routes are flanking the German rear from Sukhinichi and Sevsk. Fierce fighting is taking place in the northern Orel area. As for the British claim that the Red Army has cut the Vyazma-Smolensk railway, Moscow Radio has remained silent. Regarding Rzhev, the Soviet side claims to have crossed the Vosuga River and occupied the city of Vosuga.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 7th: German forces at the mouth of the Kuban River suddenly switched from defense to offense on the 5th, causing the situation in the Western Caucasus, where the two sides were in a stalemate, to gradually become active. German forces are concentrating their main forces on the left flank to launch an offensive. On the 6th, they surrounded three Soviet divisions in the lake and swamp area, annihilating two divisions completely and severely damaging the other.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Orel and Other Places; The Soviet Offensive Has Been Thwarted</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 7th: Fierce fighting is still taking place in the area northwest of Orel and Kursk, but the Soviet offensive has been thwarted. Although Soviet forces broke through German positions in several places, they were immediately repelled by German counterattacks. From a strategic perspective, the Soviet forces have achieved nothing. The Soviet forces have also launched repeated attacks between Orel and Luki, but with very limited forces. Their aim seems to be to hinder German movements or probe German strength. As a result, they have been severely damaged and repelled by German forces. The Soviet offensive near Rossosh has also failed. There are many Soviet troops concentrated on the Mius Front, suggesting a possible large-scale offensive in the near future. German forces recently annihilated many troops of the Soviet 58th Army near the lower Kuban River, further consolidating the German bridgehead east of the Kerch Strait.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 7th: According to sources here, Soviet forces have been continuously attacking in the Orel area for four weeks, with 40,000 casualties and 350 tanks lost. According to front-line reports, Soviet forces launched an offensive in the Orel area on February 4th. Fierce fighting occurred on February 16th and 17th, when a Soviet infantry division, a tank regiment, a ski brigade, and other units concentrated their attack, attempting to break through the German left flank, but were defeated by German forces. German forces counterattacked on the 18th, annihilating the remaining Soviet forces, with over 2,000 Soviet soldiers killed. After that, Soviet forces launched two more attacks, with 6,500 casualties. The Soviet army continued its fierce offensive, with over 18,000 casualties in six days. The Soviet attacks from the south and southwest on the 5th of this month also failed.</p>
<h3>Heroic Bayonet Fights Break Out in Various Places South of Lake Ilmen</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, 7th: According to aggregated reports received here, since the 5th of this month, the weather south of Lake Ilmen in the Staraya Russa area on the Eastern Front has suddenly turned cold again. As a result, the offensive and defensive battles between the German and Soviet forces in the area have become more intense. Fierce bayonet fights seem to be taking place everywhere. General Timoshenko's forces are focusing their attacks on the east and northeast sides of the city. To secure the crossing points on the Lovati River, large numbers of troops have been repeatedly sent to attack in that direction. German forces are occupying a strategically advantageous position in the marshland, and they continue to resist. As of noon on the 6th, the Soviet army has not been able to set foot on the left bank of the river. South of Staraya Russa, German forces appear to be launching a fierce counterattack along the upper reaches of the Lovati River. There have also been large-scale mechanized unit battles near Kholm. German forces have destroyed 31 Soviet tanks. The overall situation is quite favorable for the German forces.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 7th: Official circles here stated last night that the Soviet 3rd Tank Army south of Kharkiv has been annihilated after a short, bloody battle. This tank army, composed of elite troops, was surrounded several days ago and repeatedly attempted to break out without success. German forces tightened the encirclement last week and finally cleared out the remnants of the tank army after a fierce battle on Friday. In another area of the front, a remnant tank regiment from a Soviet brigade escaped, but was intercepted by German forces and soon surrendered. To the east, German forces continued to sweep through the Slavyansk area. Soviet troops around Izium were heavily attacked by German aircraft, suffering heavy casualties and losing 17 artillery pieces and 90 transport vehicles. Soviet forces in other areas of the Eastern Front also suffered extremely heavy losses. On Friday alone, the Soviets lost 57 aircraft. On the Mius Front north of Taganrog, Soviet attacks were repelled. Soviet forces made several small-scale attacks on newly captured German positions on the Donets River, but were driven back. Soviet forces in the southwestern Caucasus have not suffered significant losses in recent days. For example, Soviet forces attempted to undermine German defensive positions downstream of the Kuban River but failed. Six divisions and three brigades of Soviet forces were annihilated or severely damaged. On Friday, German forces killed 1,900 Soviet soldiers, including the commander of the Soviet 77th Rapid Fire Division. In the Novorossiysk area, the Soviet side again attempted to reinforce their troops from the sea, but were repelled by German coastal defense artillery. In the Kursk-Orel area, Soviet forces continued their fierce attacks on Friday, breaking into German lines at several points, but were repelled by fierce German counterattacks. At the same time, German forces have strengthened their defenses south of Orel. On the central and northwestern fronts, Soviet forces repeatedly attacked, especially in the Staraya Russa area south of Lake Ilmen, but all failed.</p>
<h3>Stalin Appointed Marshal of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Moscow, 7th: The Soviet government announced on the 6th that Chairman Stalin has been appointed Marshal.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Moscow, 7th: Moscow Radio announced last night that the Soviet government has issued an order appointing Stalin as Marshal.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Exaggerate Their Offensive Propaganda, But It Is Actually Impossible</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Buenos Aires, 7th: After Roosevelt and Churchill's meeting in Casablanca, the British and American camps appeared to be slightly revitalized and have been making exaggerated propaganda efforts at home and abroad. Churchill has claimed that a landing operation will be carried out in Central Europe this year, and Roosevelt has also said that an offensive will be launched to invade the Japanese mainland. But what is the true meaning of their active propaganda? What are the underlying plans of the meeting? If we look at this war, only the Soviet Union and China are fighting with all their national strength on the Allied side. However, both have been exploited by the Allies. Therefore, Chairman Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek are very dissatisfied with the cunning attitude of their allies, Britain and the United States. At the same time, the people of Britain and the United States also criticize their governments for being weak and incompetent, and they deeply doubt what the British and American forces are actually doing. Some even ask if the US fleet is only active on Hollywood film sets. All these criticisms have their considerable reasons. Although Britain and the United States launched an offensive in North Africa last year, the German and Italian forces in Tunisia have repeatedly won great victories, while the American forces have suffered significant blows. Therefore, Roosevelt's raving, "We must conquer each island one by one to invade the Japanese mainland," is hard for even his own citizens to believe. Roosevelt and Churchill feel that they must put on a sensational show as a stimulant, and thus the Casablanca meeting was held. However, because the heads of most of the other Allied forces also participated in this meeting, it can be assumed that Britain and the United States may take some action this year. If Britain and the United States still take no action, not only is there a possibility of a major reaction on the British and American home fronts, but the Soviet Union and China may also withdraw from their alliance due to the incompetence of Britain and the United States. In this critical situation, Britain and the United States are deeply distressed about how to start their operations. Thus, they are again engaged in propaganda, saying that a major offensive is about to be launched. Therefore, the motives behind this propaganda are nothing more than the following points: First, the ultimate goal implied in this propaganda by Britain and the United States, which will launch a major offensive against the Axis powers, is nothing more than to wage a long-term war of attrition with the Axis powers to the very end and to preserve their military strength. This is the basic principle of Britain and the United States to complete this war, and it is also the means by which they conduct the war. Second, the internal aspect of this propaganda of a major offensive by Britain and the United States is an attempt to depress the morale of the Axis powers and to alienate the solidarity of Japan, Germany, and Italy. Third, since the Casablanca meeting, although Britain and the United States have repeatedly propagated that they will take some action, in reality, they will only launch small-scale attacks at most. Fourth, in order to continue to sacrifice the Soviet Union and China, Britain and the United States are using the propaganda of an upcoming major offensive as bait, trying their best to win over the Soviet Union and China to participate in their anti-Axis camp. Fifth, Britain and the United States are not only trying to create an unstable atmosphere in the areas occupied by the Axis powers, but also trying to threaten the neutral policies of other countries. Recently, Britain and the United States have been actively carrying out plans to incite Turkey, Spain, Sweden, and other countries to abandon their neutrality, which is very obvious. The recent statement by the President of Turkey is enough to reflect that these conspiracies of Britain and the United States have progressed to a considerable extent in Turkey. Conversely, the British and American plans against Spain have been abandoned because there has been no hope of success. Regarding Sweden, Britain and the United States continue to extend their evil hands, trying to make it abandon its neutrality. In addition, the United States is secretly working hard to get Finland to negotiate a separate peace with Britain. At the same time, in Latin America, as a result of the United States' long-term political strategy, Chile has now been lured into severing diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. The countries of Latin America have been won over to participate in the anti-Axis camp. At present, Argentina is the only neutral country left in the Western Hemisphere. Under this situation, what their future strategy will be is already very clear. In short, the purpose of Britain and the United States' massive propaganda after the Casablanca meeting is actually a scene in their plan to wage a long-term war of attrition. Therefore, they are making this propaganda of an upcoming major offensive only to fulfill their delusion of prolonging the war.</p>
<h3>Agriculture and Fisheries in the Southern Regions Are Now Developing Smoothly; Report by Director Mizumachi at the Japanese Parliament</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 7th: Itaro Mizumachi, Director of the Southern Affairs Bureau of the Greater East Asia Ministry, stated yesterday at a meeting of the Accounting Committee of the House of Representatives that the development of agriculture and fisheries in the Southern Regions is now progressing smoothly. The Greater East Asia Ministry is in contact with military authorities and other relevant ministries and has formulated plans regarding agriculture and livestock farming in the Southern Regions, which are being implemented by military authorities in the Southern Regions. Regarding Japan's agricultural policy towards the Southern Regions, great importance is placed on supplementing the agricultural products that the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere currently lacks. Agriculture is closely related to the lives of the local residents, so all matters related to agriculture must be considered. Many local people plant rubber trees and sugarcane, so drastic measures to reduce their production will not be taken. In areas under Japanese administration, efforts are being made to produce more lotus root, jute, and other textile raw materials, as current production is not sufficient to meet demand. Cotton planting in various places is developing rapidly due to favorable weather and cooperation from local residents. In a few battles, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be self-sufficient in cotton. There is currently a surplus of coconut oil and palm oil, and new uses are being sought to maintain their current production. The demand for sugar for making alcohol is quite high, so there is no need to reduce its production. Quinine is a specialty of the Southern Regions, and demand is also high, so efforts will be made to increase its production. Generally speaking, there is no shortage of food in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Under the current situation, efforts are being made to ensure that each region is self-sufficient in grain. Marapi wood and other useful timber produced in the Southern Regions are currently being used as materials for war and shipbuilding. Increasing livestock production is an important factor and is currently being carefully considered. Leather production is a military necessity. The production of raw materials and their industrial utilization must be handled by relevant Japanese authorities in order to save on shipping. Establishing a large food industry in the South is also for this reason.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Advisor Elaborates on the Current Situation in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Osaka, 7th: This day at the New Osaka Hotel, the highest advisor for the Japanese side on the Philippines, Marquis Yorimichi Dere, gave a talk on the current state of Filipino culture and the American administration of the Philippines over the years. The gist of his talk was that, although the United States claims to have given the Philippines complete independence, we have not seen any examples of this. Rather, the United States has implemented a policy of aestheticism in both economic and cultural aspects. For example, in terms of cultural policy, it absolutely does not allow any Filipino self-reflection and takes advantage of Filipino shortcomings by placing them in a state of decline with low-brow movies and seductive music. When Batangas was captured, I inspected the area. On the way, I saw Filipino sailors carrying water buckets passing by compatriots who were about to die of thirst, without any sympathy, and hurrying away. Therefore, although they are currently cooperating with Japan, there are still many people who harbor the skeptical notion of what Japan will give us. We answered that we will give you Filipinos the Philippines of Filipinos and the spirit of the independence of the Philippines of East Asians, and furthermore give them appropriate guidance based on this. Also, since the Japanese army occupied Batangas, they have deeply felt the power of the Japanese army, but they still harbor a sense of terror. Therefore, we must provide them with sincere and kind guidance, and we must expose the false propaganda of the United States in order to gain their sincere trust. This is the prerequisite policy currently being reviewed. Regarding education, we are making great efforts to eliminate the remaining American influence, and we have already achieved considerable results. Furthermore, intellectuals in the Philippines have always praised American material civilization. However, Prime Minister Tojo's statement has awakened great self-reflection in Filipinos and is gradually leading them towards the path of cooperating sincerely with the Japanese side. In short, we are currently using all our strength to eliminate the American influence in the Philippines and to make Filipinos rely on Japan and build a prosperous Philippines within the Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<h3>Economic Control Agencies Cooperatively Implement Military Administration</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Manila, 7th: Since the implementation of military administration in the Philippines, various economic measures have been established. A brief summary of the recent economic situation in the Philippines is as follows: (1) Establishment of various control mechanisms: The most important development in the Philippine economic world recently is the successive establishment of economic control agencies founded by both the government and the private sector, to cooperatively implement military administration. After the establishment of the Philippine Sugar Association on the 6th of last month, the Philippine Cotton Cultivation Association and the Philippine Tobacco Association, etc., were also established successively. These agencies, under the guidance of the Military Administration Department, aim to implement various important measures for the reorganization of agriculture in the Philippines. Filipinos and Spanish and German business owners residing in the Philippines have all joined. In addition, agencies such as the Cigar Tobacco Association and Chinese merchants engaged in purchasing and distribution have also joined as members. (2) Reorganization of the Philippine Sugar Industry: After the establishment of the Sugar Industry Association, the Philippine sugar industry, as one wing of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, is being reorganized in light of the Philippine situation. Currently, this reorganization work is in progress. As for changing sugarcane fields to grow cotton, it has largely been successful. At present, for the sake of rationalizing the sugarcane industry, plans are being made to harvest a large amount of sugarcane from a small number of sugarcane fields, and at the same time to improve sugar manufacturing technology to advance in accordance with the alcohol production increase plan. In addition, the conversion of enemy sugar factories to produce butane is almost complete. In the past, Philippine sugar was supplied to the United States. Regardless, the sugarcane industry has been reorganized and developed in accordance with the production system of converting to fuel alcohol and butane. (3) Second Year of Cotton Production: Last year's cotton production increase plan was successful. Harvesting has now begun. Also, purchasing prices are set according to the grade of the goods. Currently, all of the cotton is filling the warehouses in Manila City. This time the harvest results are excellent. The Military Administration Department announced the outline of the second year plan on the 22nd of last month, planning to increase the cultivation area threefold. The main cultivation areas have also been designated as Luzon Island, Panay Island, and Mindanao. (4) Promoting the Exchange of Foreign Capital with the Philippines: The export of Philippine materials has greatly increased. At the same time, daily necessities imported from Japan have arrived last month. Also, according to the trade agreement, large quantities of paper, cotton fabrics, and tobacco imported from Shanghai and Guangzhou have arrived one after another. The exchange of materials with various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in the future is highly anticipated. The Military Administration Department also reorganized the Philippine Special Trade Association in early February within the scope of the Philippine Import and Export Association as an implementing agency for foreign exports. Its business is to transport surplus agricultural products to Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places, and at the same time ensure the distribution of daily necessities within the island.</p>
<h3>The Value of Cooperative Spirit Lies in Spontaneity—An Example of Collective Effort in Building a Bridge</h3>
<p>A section of the highway between Mingguang and Dingyuan in Anhui Province is very difficult to build, especially the bridge construction project in Meishi Town. Here is a beautiful story full of the spirit of shared destiny. The Mingguang-Dingyuan line (Mingguang-Dingyuan line, Anhui Province) project of the Central China Railway began construction at the end of last year. The most difficult section of this project is the construction of the bridge in Meishi Town, because the weather was very cold at that time, and the people did not know when the Mingguang-Dingyuan highway, which they relied on, could be completed and opened to traffic.</p>
<p>One day, someone went to visit Captain 〇〇 of the Garrison, who was none other than Zhong Shaoqing, the town head of Meishi Town. He had the demeanor of an elder and was loved by the villagers like a warm winter day and respected like a kind father. He knew that the bridge project in Meishi Town would not be easy, so he visited Captain 〇〇 of the Garrison and said very generously, "Let me do this project, because highway transportation is our lifeline, so I am willing to share the burden." Captain 〇〇 was greatly moved by his passionate speech and talked it over with the highway engineering department of the Central China Railway and asked him to help handle this matter.</p>
<p>Town Head Zhong was very happy to get such a result. He immediately went to the nearby residents' homes, one by one, to explain the reasons. His zealous heart touched the heartstrings of everyone. Then many residents brought shovels and ladders to Town Head Zhong's home, gathered together, and set off to build the bridge.</p>
<p>Under the united collective effort of the people, the town head personally supervised, rain or shine, and finally overcame all difficulties. As of the beginning of this month, nine-tenths of the project has been completed, and only a very small section remains.</p>
<p>It is planned to hold a grand opening ceremony after the entire project is completed. The Central China Railway highly commends Town Head Zhong's fearless spirit and his ability to sacrifice himself for the public good, and has decided to publicly commend his achievements at the opening ceremony. (Translated by Yun Peng from the Continental New Report on March 7th)</p>
<h3>First Anniversary of Japanese Occupation: Overview of Burmese Revival - Establishing Security, Restoring Transportation, Striving for Increased Production with Excellent Results</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency) - March 8th marks the first anniversary of the Japanese occupation of Rangoon. Similarly, one year has passed since Burma began its reconstruction. It has now become a strong wing within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. On June 8th of last year, when the Japanese forces pacified all of Burma, Lieutenant General Shojiro Iida, the highest commander of the Japanese Army in Burma, announced the implementation of military administration. Furthermore, to organize an administrative body for the Burmese people, he appointed Dr. Ba Maw and six others as preparatory committee members for the central administrative body. Major cities in central and northern Burma had been looted and set on fire by the Chungking forces. Consequently, almost all of Mandalay and other major cities were reduced to scorched earth. In addition, transportation was disrupted, and resources were severely lacking, causing the residents to suffer greatly. The extremely deteriorated sanitary conditions made the situation extremely worrying. Later, on August 1st, Dr. Ba Maw, under the command of the highest commander of the Japanese Army in Burma, was appointed as the head of the executive administration. He actively cooperated with the ministers of Interior, Finance, Agriculture, Commerce and Industry, Transportation, Water Conservancy, Forestry, Civil Engineering, Justice, Education, and Health. The first priorities of the administrative policy were establishing security, restoring transportation, and improving education and health. They also devoted their full efforts to repairing the highways and bridges destroyed by the British and Chungking forces. Consequently, within six months of the war, security in all of Burma gradually returned. At the same time, the Burmese executive administration, with the assistance of the military administration supervisory department, began to promote the revival of Burma's major industries, such as agriculture, forestry, and mining, and encouraged increased production. This year's rice production is comparable to pre-war levels. Teak wood is a major product of Burmese forestry, with a large portion being shipped to Japan before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The quality of cotton is also excellent, and efforts are currently being made to increase production, which will undoubtedly yield excellent results in the future. As for transportation, the two main railway lines, Rangoon to Mandalay and Rangoon to Prome, were both opened to traffic in May of last year. Domestic postal services in Burma were also restored in June of last year, and telegram services were opened in October. Postal and telegraph services between Burma, the southern regions, China, and Manchuria also began at the same time. Furthermore, in the past year, the political and military awareness of the Burmese people has been significantly heightened. Burma had been oppressed by the tyrannical British government, and the mental and physical suffering they endured is indescribable. Therefore, when the Japanese forces entered Burma, Burmese youths organized volunteer armies and fully cooperated with the Japanese forces, taking active actions and operating in various regions. After the Japanese forces pacified all of Burma, these volunteer armies, recognizing that their mission had been accomplished, were reorganized into the Burmese Defense Army. They cooperated directly with the Japanese forces, continuing to operate as a wing to defeat the Anglo-American enemies. The Burmese people's determination to destroy the Anglo-Americans has also grown stronger. In particular, the recent indiscriminate bombing of various regions of Burma by the Anglo-American air forces has caused extreme indignation among the 16 million Burmese people. People in various regions have spontaneously organized defense corps, with the Yangon Citizens Defense Corps being the most active and effective. As for the implementation of military administration, it has spread throughout Burma. The Burmese executive administration's central and local administrative organizations under the military administration have been able to better perform their functions. Since the Japanese government declared that it would recognize Burma's independence no later than this year, the Burmese people have been devoting their full efforts to defending Burma to thwart the Anglo-American counter-offensive and are advancing in cooperation with the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as one of its wings.</p>
<h3>Japanese Photo Exhibition Held in Berlin</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese photo exhibition, with the assistance of the German government, was held in Berlin on the 6th and received general acclaim. The content of the photos mainly consists of Japanese landscapes, religious ceremonies, architecture, and general life, totaling over 150 types. They were taken by members of the Cultural Department of the German Embassy in Tokyo and were all sent to Germany after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Rome Talks Determine Political Strategy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Haitong News Agency) - Berlin believes that the talks between Germany and Italy in Rome are a major victory for the Axis powers in politics. Germany and Italy confirmed that the overall war situation will be decided in Eastern Europe, and that Tunisia is a bridgehead for the European continent, which must be defended with all efforts. They intend to use political power, with the new conditions after the war as bait, to lure the people of Europe. However, since the discord between Poland and the Soviet Union, the Atlantic Charter has completely lost its value. In contrast, the Axis countries have detailed explanations of their war goals and future order, allowing the people of Europe to understand deeply and without any doubt. They deeply know that they are shedding blood to defend culture, and at the same time, they are fighting for freedom, peace, and justice. Therefore, the political strategy determined by the Rome Conference has won the support of the European people.</p>
<h3>Finnish Prime Minister Issues New Appointments</h3>

<h3>Two Brazilian Cargo Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian government announced on the 6th that a 3,540-ton merchant ship and a 6,075-ton cargo ship were each torpedoed by Axis submarines. The cargo ship was attacked on February 18th while sailing off the Brazilian coast, and the merchant ship was attacked on March 2nd. It appears that the crews of both ships have been rescued. The cargo ship was originally a German ship that sought refuge in the port of Santos when the war broke out. It was seized when Brazil declared war on Germany.</p>
<h3>Change of Commander for the Hawaiian Naval District</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Allied News Agency) - According to reports from Honolulu, US Vice Admiral Ghormley has replaced Rear Admiral Baggley as Commander of the Hawaiian Naval District and Commander of the Fourteenth Naval District. Ghormley previously served as Commander of the Southwest Pacific Allied Naval Forces and was removed from his post last autumn, succeeded by Vice Admiral Halsey.</p>
<h3>Political Instability in Equatorial Country: Risk of Riots - Section of Pan-American Highway Completed - Brazilian Seaport Under Construction</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 6th (Havas News Agency) - According to news from the capital of Equatorial Country, the political situation in the country is turbulent and unstable, with a risk of armed riots. However, the actual situation is largely unknown due to the authorities' strict control of newspapers and radio broadcasts. However, there are various reasons to believe that some officers of the capital's garrison are actually plotting to overthrow the government. There are two motives: (1) Dissatisfaction with the government's lack of response after Peruvian troops forcibly occupied a part of the eastern border area of Equatorial Country; (2) The rebels claim to adhere to left-wing ideology, with most of them belonging to the left-wing Socialist Party. Alba, who has been the party leader for two years, has been deported by the authorities, and many party members have been arrested. Cavalry troops are currently patrolling the streets of the capital. The President has personally visited the barracks of the capital's garrison and talked with the soldiers, urging them to be loyal to the current regime.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 7th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from Managua, the highway between the capitals of Honduras and Nicaragua has been completed. This highway is a section of the Pan-American Highway and is approximately 265 kilometers long.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 7th (Haitong News Agency) - It is claimed here that the construction of a seaport in the capital city of Santos State, Brazil, is expected to be one-quarter completed by mid-May and half completed by June. At that time, large ships will be able to enter. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of October.</p>
<h3>The British Empire in Wartime Economic Distress (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Long Fei</p>
<p>(III) Financial Expansion and National Burden</p>
<p>In April 1942, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Kingsley Wood, presented a budget of £5,286 million for the fiscal year 1942-43. This represents an increase of £510 million over the actual expenditure of the previous year, and is more than double the pre-war expenditure of £1,068 million in 1938-39. This is an unprecedentedly large budget in British financial history. During the previous Great War, the highest amount of British war expenditure was 64% of national income in 1918, while the current estimated national income of Britain is £8,500 million, and war expenditure already accounts for 64% of it.</p>
<p>British Finance and National Income Table</p>
<p>Estimated for the beginning of the year × Estimated in April 1941</p>
<p>Based on "The Economist" magazine, national debt is the figure at the beginning of the year</p>
<p>The total expenditure for the three years since the first year of the war, 1939-40, plus the budget for the previous year, amounts to a huge sum of £15,770 million, exceeding the total war expenditure of the previous Great War by 50%, or £1,500 million. In British finance, the role of tax revenue is higher than in other countries, with more than 40% relying on tax revenue, but it still cannot escape the reduction of national wealth. According to "The Economist", government expenditure and national consumption exceeded national income by approximately £950 million in 1940-41 and by £1,350 million in 1941-42. The reduction of national wealth is increasing day by day, and 60% of the £4,000 million in foreign assets before the war has been lost.</p>
<p>This trend is likely to increase further due to the increase in war expenditure in the future, and of the £5,200 million budget, £4,000 million in expenditures of £1 billion each in March, June, September, and October have already been approved by Parliament, leaving only slightly more than £1 billion of the previous year's budget. Furthermore, the average daily war expenditure has also increased from £12 million in June 1942 to £12.225 million in September and £15 million in October. Due to the increasing expansion of the war, there has been a more alarming increase recently.</p>
<p>In response to the increase in war expenditure, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Kingsley Wood, proposed new tax increase proposals when presenting the budget for the previous year. These proposals stipulated increased taxes on beer, liquor, tobacco, theater tickets, and luxury goods sales, attempting to increase tax revenue by £150 million annually. It should be noted that increases in income tax and other direct taxes have not yet been implemented, presumably because the national burden has reached its limit. Looking at the reality of income tax, it has gradually increased from five shillings and sixpence before the war to seven shillings and sixpence, eight shillings and sixpence, and ten shillings. Currently, the combined income tax and surtax reach a maximum of nineteen shillings and sixpence, meaning that only sixpence is actually received out of one pound. In that case, how can it be raised further? Before the war, income tax revenue was £400 million, while the surtax in the 1942 budget is estimated at £980 million. On a per capita basis, the average tax burden has increased from £24 one shilling before the war to the current £51 fourteen shillings, and the tax exemption point has been reduced to £250.</p>
<p>Secondly, the wartime excess profits tax rate has increased by 10%, with an estimated revenue of £400 million. However, 20% of the excess profits tax is returned as post-war reconstruction funds. Including other property taxes, the revenue from direct taxes is £800 million. On the other hand, the revenue from indirect taxes, £200 million each from alcohol and tobacco consumption taxes, and a purchase tax rate of 33% to 66%, mostly 66%, is estimated at £84 million.</p>
<p>In addition, Canada contributed £1 billion (£225 million) in goods to the UK, which was included in the treasury income for the fiscal year 1941.</p>
<p>Of the £5,200 million budget for 1942, £2,500 million came from tax revenue, and the remaining £2,600 million had to be borrowed. This was supplemented by £1,900 million in national savings and £700 million in the depletion of foreign capital. However, it is questionable whether this doubled savings amount compared to the previous year can be fully met. Therefore, maintaining the huge wartime finance in the future will inevitably require further restrictions on national consumption, because there is no other way than to lower the national standard of living and save to supplement the shortfall.</p>
<p>Comparison Table of British Food Rationing and Pre-War Consumption</p>
<p>British Food Situation Table</p>
<p>Based on the Soviet "World Politics and World Economy" magazine</p>
<p>Average from 1934-1936</p>
<p>(IV) Problems of Prices and Wages</p>
<p>From the index of recent price trends in Britain, the index before the Second World War—the end of August 1939—was 138.9, which rose to 174.4 one year later, an increase of 25%; two years later, it rose again to 185.1, and continued to rise to 186.2 at the end of June 1942, an increase of 34% in the five months after the outbreak of the war.</p>
<p>However, looking at the various periods of various materials in the price fluctuations, the rise is not as slight as mentioned above. It can also be seen that the difficulty of imports, the shortage of labor, and the increase in military expenditure constitute an insurmountable factor in the rise in prices. According to the British Ministry of Commerce, from the outbreak of the war to the end of April 1942, during this period, prices rose, food prices rose by 77%, and manufactured goods prices rose by 56%. From the perspective of individual commodities, wool was 67.5%, cotton was 74.9%, and textiles were 70.7%.</p>
<p>In the rising prices, the reduction in quantity cannot be ignored. In the two years after the outbreak of the war, the total quantity of retail sales decreased by 25% compared with the pre-war period, which increased the burden on the national consumption life. Regarding these, according to the cost-of-living index published by the Labor Department (based on July 1941), it was 155 on September 1, 1939, 165 at the end of September, 199 at the end of March 1942, and further rose to 200 at the end of April.</p>
<p>As prices rise, wages should naturally follow suit, which is causing pain in various countries. The demands of coal miners for wage increases can be seen as a flaw in British price policy. Wage disputes began in April and May 1940, and were temporarily resolved based on the decision to establish a minimum weekly wage of 83 shillings in mid-June. However, the control of the coal mining industry caused dissatisfaction among capitalists, and on July 1, the government finally implemented national management of all coal mines. However, the imbalanced development of prices in both civilian and military vessels, the contradictions within, and its impact can be imagined.</p>
<p>In any case, it is undeniable that as price controls are strengthened in the future, deep social problems will inevitably arise.</p>
<p>The "British Empire," mired in wartime economic distress, is gradually heading towards destruction. (The End)</p>

<h3>The Anti-British and Anti-American Movement of the Past Year: Work Report of the Anti-British and Anti-American Association</h3>
<p>Since our friendly nation Japan launched the Greater East Asia War the year before last ("January 28th Incident"), the Chinese people have felt excited. The Chinese nation, which has suffered from the British and American aggression for over a century, is extremely willing to rise up and seek survival under the encouragement of the friendly nation, to wipe out the humiliation. Based on the needs of the times, the Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association was established in Shanghai on February 25th of last year, gathering social leaders to devote themselves to promoting the anti-British and anti-American movement. Now that the association's first anniversary is approaching, the work report of the association's anti-British and anti-American movement over the past year is specially summarized and disclosed below:</p>
<p>(1) Enlightenment of Anti-British and Anti-American Sentiment</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the association has been engaged in the propaganda of the anti-British and anti-American movement. It held an anti-British and anti-American propaganda week around May of last year. The focus of its work was on the enlightenment movement against the British and the Americans. During this movement, in order to awaken the public and unite all Asian ethnic groups to work together against the British and the Americans, the association specifically solicited lyrics for the "Greater East Asia Ethnic Unity March" and produced 100,000 records of the "Greater East Asia Ethnic Unity March", which were distributed to radio stations, cinemas, and dance halls in the city for broadcast and singing. It also produced and printed various colored murals, which were posted on important streets and in shop windows to spread propaganda widely. Lantern slides exposing the crimes of British and American aggression against East Asia were shown in cinemas. In addition, a type of Greater Asia Pictorial and two types of books and historical paintings (namely the May 30th Massacre and the Opium War, etc.) were published and given to members of the public who came to the association to request them. There was no interruption every day. The first editions were given away completely in less than a month after publication. Furthermore, a symposium was held to entertain cultural, cartoon, and news circles, and leaders of various industries in Shanghai in order to establish ties, promote the association's mission, and achieve cooperation. Over the past year, the association's work has been implemented item by item according to the plan, thanks to the assistance of people from all walks of life, which has been truly significant.</p>
<p>(2) Holding Meetings of People from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>After holding the anti-British and anti-American propaganda week at the end of May last year, the association convened a grand meeting of people from all walks of life and representatives of various organizations at the racecourse on June 3rd. Those present included Section Chief Ling, representative of Mayor Chen, Feng Jie, director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai office, social leaders Yuan Ludeng, Yan Keding, Chen Fumu, and people from various organizations in the city, including agriculture, industry, commerce, students, drama, and entertainment, as well as Assistant Takahashi of the intelligence agency of a friendly nation, totaling tens of thousands of people. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The Shanghai Electric Broadcasting Company specially installed two amplifying broadcasting machines on the spot. The China Film Company sent personnel to the spot to film newsreels of the meeting and entertainment. After the meeting, the whole group marched in the rain for a week along the Bund. Citizens enthusiastically participated, creating a sensation throughout the city. This meeting was unprecedented in Shanghai's history and was the city's first mass meeting since the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>(3) Essay Solicitation on the Fall of Singapore</h3>
<p>After the fall of Singapore last year, in order to encourage the people to rise up and strengthen their cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, the association held an essay solicitation on "The Fall of Singapore as the Pivot of Greater East Asia Construction, the Hopes and Feelings of the People After the Fall of the New Island." Jin Dingdong, Zhou Bangjun, Xu Jinghou, and other gentlemen were invited to be judges. More than 100 essays were submitted. The results of the evaluation were: first place, Zhao Ruheng; second place, Wang Yan. The association compiled the selected essays and 19 excellent works into a type of series of books with a total of 115,000 words and gave them to people from all walks of life to read in order to spread propaganda widely.</p>
<p>(4) Films, Music, and Drama</p>
<p>Over the past year, the association has held gatherings on important commemorative holidays to promote the current mission of the people to emphasize the anti-British and anti-American work and the construction of East Asia. It held a film and music gala on the fifth anniversary of the "July 7th Incident". On November 8th, it showed the "Malayan War Record" film at the Grand Theatre, inviting people from all walks of life to attend. People from all walks of life participated enthusiastically, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. December 8th coincided with the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. The association specially prepared a drama propaganda to celebrate. On that day, the four-act anti-British and anti-American drama "Jiang Zhou Weeps Blood" was performed at the Grand Theatre, with the help of Zhang Shankun, general manager of China Union Film Company, and the support of the Army News Department of a friendly nation, and starring first-class film and drama stars. The plot was tense, and there were more than ten thousand spectators. Anti-British and anti-American sentiments were at their highest.</p>
<p>(5) Establishing a Broadcasting Lecture Series</p>
<p>In order to increase the effectiveness of anti-British and anti-American propaganda work, the association specifically established an "Anti-British and Anti-American Aggression Broadcasting Lecture Series" at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station in the city. From November 11th of last year to February of this year, a total of seven anti-British and anti-American aggression broadcasts were held. Celebrities and important government officials were invited to give lectures, and the lectures were broadcast to various places at home and abroad. A large number of listeners were expected, so that the awareness of anti-British and anti-American aggression could penetrate the hearts of people around the world.</p>
<p>(6) Assisting Indian Independence</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Indian anti-British movement, the association has expressed its sincere sympathy from the standpoint of East Asian ethnic unity and actively launched a movement to aid India. On August 7th of last year, it sponsored a symposium on Indian liberation, inviting representatives from China, Japan, Germany, and India to participate. The symposium was enthusiastic. In addition, it sent telegrams to comfort the leaders of the Indian Congress Party and sent personnel to participate in various conferences convened by the Indian Independence League in Shanghai. On October 12th of last year, it held a charity exhibition and sale of cartoons in support of India at the Daxin Company Gallery, soliciting works from painters throughout Shanghai. No less than 300 works were submitted. During the exhibition, more than 1,000 Chinese and foreign people visited. The results were excellent. The proceeds from the charity sale, excluding the artists' remuneration, were donated to Indian compatriots to fund the independence movement.</p>
<p>(7) Publishing Greater East Asia Monthly</p>
<p>In addition to the Greater Asia Pictorial, the association also publishes the "Greater East Asia Monthly" on a regular basis. It has now been published up to Volume 3, Issue 2. It has published three special issues on "The Indian Independence Movement," "The Greater East Asia War Commemoration," and "The Issue of Participation in the War," containing special articles on these issues, elaborating in detail on the future of the Indian movement, the prospects for the Greater East Asia Holy War, and the issue of participation in the war, encompassing everything.</p>
<p>(8) Supporting the Government's Participation in the War</p>
<p>On January 9th of this year, State Chairman Wang announced that the government would officially participate in the war against Britain and the United States. The association believed that the government's participation in the war was the actual practice of anti-British and anti-American aggression. The association's work over the past year has been met with the government's compassion, mobilizing the national people to strike at Britain and the United States. Therefore, the association was deeply moved by Wang's announcement and wholeheartedly supported it. That afternoon, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Zhou Zuomin, and others, the association's executive directors, sent a telegram to the government to support it and published a letter to the people and printed slogans, which were distributed to branches in various places and posted in the city's main streets. On January 31st, a lecture meeting on "Participation in the War and the People" was held at the Grand Theatre, inviting Chen Binhe, Li Quanshi, Zhang Yipeng, Lin Kanghou, Yoshida Toyu, and other gentlemen to lecture on the significance of participation in the war and showing the anti-British blockbuster "Flower Girl." More than 3,000 people attended the lectures, mostly middle school and university students. In February, the "Special Issue on Participation in the War" was published in the Greater East Asia Monthly to explain the true meaning of the government's participation in the war, thereby establishing a national consciousness against Britain and the United States and looking forward to the early completion of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>(9) Destroying Bronze Statues and Changing Street Names</p>
<p>The association believes that the aggressive forces of British and American imperialism in East Asia have completely collapsed. The concession privileges that they relied on have also been successively taken over by our government. After the Shanghai Public Concession was adjusted by the authorities of a friendly nation, the various long-standing practices of British and American arrogance have also been completely changed. However, the remaining traces in the concession are still eye-catching. The existence of foreign street names, such as Gordon Road and Hart Road, are all famous figures who invaded our country in the past. The impression they give to our compatriots is extremely bad. Now that the East Asian nations are embarking on the path of unity and revival, and Britain and the United States have no place to stand in the Far East, the various traces they have left behind should be thoroughly eliminated. Therefore, the association has spared no effort in promoting the movement to change street names and destroy bronze statues in the past six months. The association sent a letter to the Public Works Department and, together with Shanghai celebrities Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Zhou Bangjun, Chen Binhe, and hundreds of Shanghai citizens, jointly petitioned the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, suggesting that it be implemented as soon as possible. On February 17th of this year, the association sent representatives to visit the Public Works Department. Mr. Noguchi, the director-general of the Bureau of General Affairs, met with them and stated that the Public Works Department had accepted the association's recommendations in principle on the issue of changing street names and destroying bronze statues and is currently considering their implementation. Therefore, it is expected that the British and American remains in the city's concession will be cleared up in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(10) Recruiting Members and Establishing Branches</p>
<p>In order to unite comrades and strengthen the anti-British and anti-American forces, the association held a general meeting to recruit members last year and launched the organization of anti-British and anti-American branches in various places. The recruitment period was from September 10th to November 9th of last year. A total of 3,117 people joined the association. Most of the members were from the business community. Comrades from various places believed that to revive East Asia, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the British and American remnants in East Asia and awaken the compatriots to eliminate the mentality of relying on Britain and the United States. This is the prerequisite for the revival of the Chinese nation. Therefore, they have applied to organize branches one after another. As of the 31st year, branches have been organized in Guangzhou, Jiaxing, Changshu, Wujiang, Kunshan, Qingpu, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Changzhou, and other places. The Wujiang branch was established on November 26th of last year. The other places are currently in full swing, and the date of formal establishment is very near.</p>
<p>(11) Harmonizing Chinese and Japanese People</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the association's various tasks have been able to be gradually promoted with the cooperation and support of the authorities of a friendly nation and people from all walks of life. However, because the people of the city are under the protection of the police authorities of a friendly nation, misunderstandings often occur due to various complex relationships in terms of language and culture. In order to promote the peaceful friendship between the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan, the association established a Harmony Department in September of last year, with Li Guohua as the director, responsible for mediation and liaison, assisting the police authorities of a friendly nation, and protecting the rights of the people. Director Li separately hosted banquets for the police chiefs of friendly nations in Shanghai and leaders of the city's business community, engaging in cordial talks so that law-abiding people could receive legal protection under the goal of harmony. Over the past year, this work has achieved considerable results, and the prospects for Sino-Japanese cooperation are becoming increasingly bright.</p>
<p>In order to further promote Sino-Japanese harmony and cooperation, the Harmony Department has published "The Voice of the Chinese People," an irregular publication to express the wishes of the Chinese people. Two issues have been published and sent to people in the government and opposition of both countries in China and Japan in order to emphasize the basis of cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<p>(12) Assisting Students Who Have Dropped Out of School</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the association realized that outstanding students in the city were unable to continue their studies. It specially raised funds to run a scholarship program. Since the start of registration, applicants have come one after another, very enthusiastically. The total number was 208 people. The association invited celebrities and education experts from outside the association, Zhang Yipeng, Shen Siliang, Lu Gaoyi, Pan Yangyao, Huang Jingwan, and other gentlemen, to review the registered students. The review of the students' grades was completed within January. A total of 148 people met the application standards, including 27 university students such as Hua Jinkun, 40 high school students such as Shi Zhimin, and 79 junior high school students such as Li Yongfu. The detailed list was published in the Shen Bao on February 10th of this year. The work of collecting scholarships was carried out on February 12th and 13th. Those who did not meet the application standards were assisted by the association with book fees of 20 yuan each in order to encourage them and express their condolences.</p>
<p>The above are the major anti-British and anti-American works that the association has carried out over the past year. However, due to space limitations, it is not possible to describe them in detail. After the National Government announced its participation in the war, the association's responsibilities have become even greater. The association's members are ashamed of their lack of talent and fear that they will fail to live up to expectations. They sincerely hope that social leaders and enthusiastic people will provide assistance so that the remaining forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia can be eliminated as soon as possible and the goal of the Greater East Asia War can be quickly completed. Then, the revival of China and the construction of East Asia can be expected in the near future.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains Sold on a Fixed Schedule: Allotted Oil Divided Into Five Types; Prices Revised</h3>
<p>The authorities and the edible oil wholesale office and the sugar merchants' cooperative have agreed on the distribution of oil, sugar, and coarse grains based on the population. Retail merchants selling household oil and sugar have been re-registered. Retail rice shops under contract will also distribute coarse grains. All retailers have been given a deadline to prepare. Oil and sugar can be purchased with a certificate starting on the 11th of this month, and coarse grains will be sold with a certificate starting on the 21st of this month. All retailers selling oil and sugar will mark their registration number, county license, quantity, price, and start and end dates. The authorities will announce the implementation at that time. As for the quantity of allocation, the allocation standard is the monthly approved amount by the military distribution authorities. The authorities' allocation of oil, sugar, and coarse grains after the distribution of food based on the population is deeply supported by the residents. After the implementation, the black market for oil, sugar, etc. will inevitably disappear.</p>
<h3>Fifth Phase of Sugar Sales Has Ended</h3>
<p>The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative's fifth phase of sugar sales to retailers with house tax stamps has ended for (1) those who collect house tax stamps on even-numbered days, as of the day before yesterday, and (2) those who collect house tax stamps on odd-numbered days, as of yesterday. All further receipts will be stopped for the purpose of distributing sugar based on the population. The distribution of sugar certificates has been issued by the Public Works Department, the Public Concession Bureau, and the Food Administration Bureau. Residents are requested to purchase sugar from designated Class A retailers with the certificate in accordance with the authorities' announcement at that time. The cooperative will also notify all retailers that all sugar allocated in February should be properly stored for the purpose of distributing sugar based on the population. If there is any shortage, the amount of the shortage will be fined ten times the official price in accordance with the regulations of the authorities.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Prepared for Distribution Based on Population</h3>
<p>The Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office has re-registered and announced the merger of all retailers in order to implement the distribution of oil based on the population. It is also preparing to issue the oil allocated by the authorities to the retailers for the purpose of distributing oil based on the population. The distribution quantity, the date of payment for the oil, and the place to collect the edible oil will be specified and announced to all retailers for compliance within days. If all procedures can be completed before the 10th of this month, oil can be collected with the certificate starting on the 11th. The oil allocated includes five types: rapeseed oil, raw oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, and cottonseed oil. The prices have been revised. After implementation, the legitimate needs of various industries will continue to be met.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains Will Be Sold Exclusively by Rice Shops</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Agency learned from the rice industry that in order to fully maintain the people's food supply, the authorities have specially issued coarse grain certificates. The sale of coarse grains will be sold exclusively by the rice shops under contract. Those who receive coarse grain certificates will have the same rice shop specified on their certificates as the rice and flour certificates. It was originally scheduled to be sold starting from the 29th phase. Due to incomplete procedures, it has been decided that the retail of grains will begin from the 30th phase (March 21), with contracted rice shops selling the items. The allocated coarse grains will be collected at the same time as the rice and flour purchase orders are collected on the 15th of this month. However, the quantity and price of coarse grains will be announced by the authorities at that time. Each holder of the certificate can purchase in accordance with the regulations of the announcement.</p>
<h3>Surplus Agricultural Products From the Philippines Shipped to Shanghai in Exchange for Materials: Sugar, Cotton, and Tobacco Included; Newly Established Chamber of Commerce-Type Organization Handles Matters</h3>
<p>According to well-informed sources in business circles, trade relations between Shanghai and the Philippines are expected to improve significantly in the future. In addition to the city's merchants in various industries currently seeking ways to request the authorities to improve shipping to maintain trade, in the Philippines, local business people have organized a chamber of commerce-type organization to work in conjunction with the existing Philippine Importers and Exporters Association. The purpose of the new chamber of commerce is to handle trade between the Philippines and regions outside the jurisdiction of the Importers and Exporters Association. On the one hand, it will obtain the goods needed by the Philippines, and on the other hand, it will ship surplus agricultural products such as sugar, cotton, and tobacco to Shanghai and other places in exchange for materials.</p>
<h3>Sixth Phase of Rationed Grain in Urban Areas: Opening of Sales in Zhabei</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Food Administration Bureau has long been prepared for the sixth phase of rationed grain based on the population this year. Pudong, Zhabei, the city center, and other areas have started opening sales separately yesterday. Nanshi and Huxi districts have not been able to open sales earlier because some of the rice has not yet arrived. After all the rice has arrived, the sales will also be opened universally. It has been found that starting from this phase, all the previous methods of public sales of grain, where rice was issued first and then payment was made, have been effectively abolished by Director Zhang Xianzhis of the bureau. All public sales offices in each district have been able to follow the bureau's regulations of paying first and then issuing rice. In total, the rice payment paid in Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, Pudong, and other districts in the sixth phase totaled 6,123,000 yuan, which prevented some of the bureau's funds from becoming stagnant. The rationed rice and flour certificates for March have also been completely printed and are currently being collected by personnel from each district for distribution to citizens in each district.</p>
<h3>Lifting of Enemy Property Disposition to End Tomorrow: Property Owners Should Apply Promptly to Exchange for Japanese Deed and Ownership Certificate</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the property rights of true Chinese property owners, the authorities have allowed applications to lift the disposition of enemy property in accordance with the law. The application period ended on the 9th of last month. It has since been approved that applications may still be submitted in cases of special necessity that the authorities deem legitimate, but the deadline is tomorrow. Those who hold deeds registered with the British, American, or other enemy consulates, or deeds registered with other foreign consulates in the name of enemy nationals, should promptly apply to the designated agency for lifting the disposition of enemy property, exchange for a Japanese deed, and issue an ownership certificate.</p>
<h3>Changes in Household Registration Must Be Reported Within Three Days for the Sake of Equal Rations</h3>
<p>The City Police Department recently found that the heads of households (i.e., second landlords) and sub-households (i.e., third tenants) in the city do not report population movements, births, and deaths on time. Not only is the statistical accuracy of the registered population inaccurate, but also the allocation of rationed rice per capita is impossible. It is learned that in order to thoroughly investigate the population statistics and to ensure the average allocation of rationed rice in the urban area by the City Food Administration Bureau, if there are any household migrations, including moving in and out, as well as population migrations, births, and deaths, all households must report to the household registration office of each sub-bureau nearby within three days in accordance with the regulations. No delays or intentional non-reporting are allowed. Otherwise, severe punishment will be imposed if found.</p>
<h3>Anonymous Elderly Man Generously Donates Scholarship Money of 2,000; Fox Fur Coat Already Returned to the Elderly Man</h3>
<p>An anonymous elderly man has been a strong advocate for the newspaper's scholarship campaign in the past. This year, the elderly man continues to fully support it. He sent a fox fur coat to the newspaper, expressing his willingness to donate it to those who donate more than 5,000 yuan. His enthusiasm and righteousness are extremely admirable. However, the donors from all walks of life are generous and do not expect any reward in return. The elderly man admired the noble friendship of the scholarship donors and generously donated 2,000 yuan yesterday. The newspaper took the opportunity to inform the elderly man about the situation of donors from all walks of life politely declining the donation of the fur coat and returned it to him.</p>

<h3>Accident Involving Trolleybus on Kaifeng Road: Driver Arrested; Driving Quite Fast and Not Ringing the Bell</h3>
<p>At 4:30 p.m. on the 4th of this month, the driver Ding Juemei, driving trolleybus number 18, was careless and caused an accident near Kaifeng Road and Rehe Road. He knocked down the six-year-old daughter Da Bao of Mrs. Dai Wang, who lives at 21 Kaifeng Road in Nanjing, injuring her vital parts.

The younger son Laifa was fortunately unharmed. Shen Jinrui is currently being treated at the Shanghai Shooting Range. Yesterday, a detective from the Huisi Patrol Station arrested the driver Ding Juemei and sent him to the First Special Court, requesting detention. A Chinese constable, number 1986, who was on the trolleybus that day, testified that after the defendant knocked down the girl, rickshaw puller Shen Jinrui also fell at the same time. Before the accident, the driver was driving quite fast and did not ring the bell, causing a major accident. Judge Lu ordered that he be returned to custody and rescheduled for further verification.</p>

<h3>Post Office Actively Seeks Ways to Adjust Domestic Postal Routes;</h3>
<p>Postal Services on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line Return to Normal;</p>
<p>Citizens' ID Required for Mailing Parcels;</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has repeatedly sought to improve domestic mail delivery routes, mostly via land and water. However, due to the war situation in various regions, delivery times have been extended. This reporter learned from the Transportation Section of the Administration that they are actively seeking ways to adjust domestic postal routes to ensure prompt delivery and prevent loss or dampness.</p>
<p>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Postal Route:</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line postal service was previously suspended due to the war. Letters mailed from Shanghai were stamped "Postal Route Blocked" by the local post office and returned to the sender, lasting about four or five months. Following consultations and solutions between the Shanghai and Zhejiang Postal Administrations, the service has now been restored. Letters mailed from Shanghai to Jinhua, Zhuji, Dongyang, Yiwu, and other towns can reach their destinations in less than ten days. However, registered letters will take about two weeks and are transported by land and water.</p>
<p>Parcels to Various Regions:</p>
<p>Due to transportation delays, the Post Office cannot fully resume accepting parcels to all regions. Currently, parcel acceptance is limited to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other areas. Services to northern Jiangsu and other places have been gradually suspended. Therefore, the Postal Administration's parcel service volume is low, significantly impacting revenue. However, recognizing the impact of suspending parcel services on local industry and commerce, the Administration is actively planning to gradually restore services. All citizens mailing personal parcels must present their citizen identification card.</p>
<h3>Jingwu Athletic Association;</h3>
<p>Seeking Members for the 34th Term;</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jingwu Athletic Association was founded in the second year of the Xuantong era of the late Qing Dynasty, with a history of 34 years and over 3,000 members. It is a purely social service organization, focusing on physical education and emphasizing moral and intellectual development. Over the past three decades, it has continuously expanded its operations and garnered support and sponsorship from the community. The Association seeks to develop its activities and recruit members annually. This year's 24th membership drive will be organized by a recruitment committee, with Lin Kanghou as the chief director, Yang Youming and Shi Zhidang as chief consultants, and Zhang Wenkui and Jin Xinmin as chief executive officers. The committee will be divided into 30 teams, each with its own captain, deputy captain, consultant, executive officer, and members. The recruitment target is 150,000 points, with each team responsible for 5,000 points. The membership fee is 25 yuan per member (annual fee), meaning each team must recruit 600 members, totaling 1.5 million yuan. The Association is located on the fourth floor of the Shu Da Building, with a gymnasium equipped for basketball, handball, volleyball, badminton, Western boxing, and various other equipment exercises. Members can visit the Association at any time for various fitness or ball game exercises.</p>
<h3>Music Association;</h3>
<p>20th Symphony Concert;</p>
<p>The Shanghai Music Association held its 20th symphony concert yesterday (7th) at 5:30 PM at the Lyceum Theatre on Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession. The conductor was Mei Baiqi of Datong Orchestra. The program was exceptional, including the Italian Symphony, and each piece received thunderous applause. During the intermission, tickets for the 21st symphony concert were sold. The 21st symphony concert will be held on the 14th at 5:30 PM at the Lyceum.</p>
<h3>Tramways in the Public Concession;</h3>
<p>Average Daily Mileage of 30,000 Miles; Approximately 500,000 Passengers;</p>
<p>Tramways are the only means of transportation for Shanghai's 5 million residents. The Shanghai Public Concession Tramway Company operates seven streetcar lines and fifteen trolleybus lines.</p>
<p>Streetcar lines: 1 (Jing'an Temple to Embassy Office), 2 (Jing'an Temple to Waiyangjing Bridge), 3 (Macon Road to Dongxin Bridge), 5 (North Railway Station to Dongxin Bridge), 8 (Waiyangjing Bridge to Yangshupu), 11 (Waiyangjing Bridge to Embassy Office), 12 (Tilanqiao to Jing'an Temple). Trolleybus lines: 14 (North Railway Station to Zhengjia Muqiao), 16 (Sanyangjing Bridge to Caojiadu), 17 (Sichuan Road Orange to Great World), 18 (Great World to North Railway Station), 19 (Xiaoshadu Road to Changping Road), 20 (Simalu Bund to Zhaofeng Park), 21 (Sichuan Road Bridge to Macon Road), 24 (Fuxu Road to Xiaoshadu Road, Robert Sheng Road) run hundreds of times a day.</p>
<p>These tramways travel approximately 32,000 miles daily. Comparing this to the 4,500-mile distance from Yokohama, Japan, to San Francisco, USA, it is equivalent to three round trips between Yokohama and San Francisco. The daily ridership is approximately 500,000, with even more during the spring and autumn seasons, exceeding 600,000. This demonstrates the significant number of people who rely on tramways for transportation. On average, one in ten of the five million residents uses the tramway daily. Accidents are rare, averaging about three times a month for streetcars and twice a month for trolleybuses. This is due to the extensive training of the drivers and their commitment to "safety first," as well as the increased attention of traffic police. Currently, there are about 340 tramway vehicles and approximately 3,500 employees (ticket collectors, conductors, drivers). Compared to before the Greater East Asia War, everything feels like a different era. Even the number of passengers was at most 400,000 per day before the war.</p>
<p>When the British flag flew over Shanghai, there were British double-decker buses, but they disappeared with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Everything has changed. Previously, all executives of the tramway company were from enemy countries, but they have been replaced by Chinese, Japanese, Spaniards, Portuguese, and Filipinos.</p>
<p>The current number of tramways is insufficient to meet demand, and the company is considering expanding routes and increasing the number of vehicles. Previously, there were first-class and third-class sections in the front carriage, but these have been abolished and all are now first-class. Recently, a new vehicle without first-class and third-class divisions was completed and is operating on Route 1. Five more are being prepared and are expected to be completed and operational in April.</p>
<p>To enhance employee knowledge and facilitate their work, the company provides comprehensive training and teaches Japanese. Many conductors on tramways running in Hongkou are now able to greet Japanese passengers in Japanese and announce street names, symbolizing the prelude to Sino-Japanese cooperation.

<h3>Long-Term Residents from Other Regions Must Obtain Identification Cards;</h3>
<p>Can Apply with Original County Resident Certificates;</p>
<p>To Enjoy Household Registration and Food Rationing Rights;</p>
<p>Shanghai is an important commercial hub with frequent travelers, which is quite convenient. However, since the authorities implemented food rationing based on population, people from other regions who come to Shanghai and intend to reside here for an extended period face the difficulty of not being able to purchase food rations without a local identification card. Recognizing this, the authorities in both concessions decided to remedy the situation. Anyone coming to Shanghai from the countryside who wishes to reside here permanently can immediately apply for a local identification card or residence permit from the local Baojia Affairs Office with their original Township Resident Certificate or County Resident Certificate. They must first fill out an application form, which will be approved by the police station, and then an identification card will be issued. With this card, they can enjoy the right to receive household food rations.</p>
<h3>Special Feature on Various Regions of Southeast Asia, Part Six;</h3>
<p>The Emerging Burma (1) by Qinglian</p>
<p>(1) Magnificent Buddhist Country</p>
<p>Burma is located east of Bengal, bordering Bengal in India to the southwest, Thailand to the southeast, and the Chinese provinces of Xikang and Yunnan to the north. It covers an area of 231,000 square miles, or 600,050 square kilometers. Its residents are of the Mongolian Burmese race, further divided into Shans, also known as "Baiyi," Karens, Arakanese and Yangbilians, Tailayin people, Chinese, Kachins, Palaung people, etc., essentially the Miao, Yao, and Lolo groups of southwestern China. Foreigners residing in Burma are mostly Indians, Chinese, people of mixed Indian and Burmese descent, Europeans and people of mixed European descent, and other foreigners. A population breakdown by ethnicity is provided below:</p>
<p>(1931 Census, Units in Thousands)</p>
<p>Among these residents, Buddhists account for the majority, making up 84.3% of the total population. Other smaller groups include animists at 4.4%, Muslims at 4.0%, Hindus at 3.9%, Christians at 2.3%, and others at 1.1%.</p>
<p>The small population of Burma is mainly due to the oppressive policies of British imperialism, which resulted in cruel mistreatment and massacres of Burmese and Chinese people. Secondly, the indigenous people are predominantly followers of Theravada Buddhism, and their excessive religious devotion has also affected population growth.</p>
<p>According to the 1941 national census, the Burmese population has increased by 2 million in the last ten years, reaching over 16.8 million. The primary reason is increased immigration. Among these, Indians account for approximately 2 million, Chinese approximately 230,000, and Europeans a mere 30,000. The remaining indigenous groups are mostly farmers, accounting for approximately 80%. The majority of Burmese businesses are controlled by Indians and overseas Chinese. Most Burmese farmers are exploited by usurers and pawnshops. Industries such as oil, mining, and forestry are controlled by the British. Indians are also involved in general industries and trade. Indian workers account for more than half of the Burmese workforce.</p>
<p>Burma has an excellent climate. Even in the Himalayas, on the border between India and Burma, the annual rainfall reaches 200 centimeters. However, the coastal regions bordering the Bay of Bengal are rich in Southeast Asian tropical characteristics, filled with warmth and human and natural enthusiasm. Although there is still "miasma" in the mountains of the north and northwest, it does not have a significant negative impact on people's lives.</p>
<p>Not only is the coastline imbued with Southeast Asian flavor, but more importantly, Burma is a mountainous country, with the Himalayas cutting it off from south to north. Between the mountains lies the Irrawaddy River basin – Burma's equivalent of the Yangtze River – forming Burma's primary agricultural region, full of poetic and picturesque fertile land. The mountains of Burma are covered in forests, further enhancing the splendor and beauty of this Buddhist country!</p>
<p>(2) Abundant Resources</p>
<p>The northeastern, western, and northwestern sides of Burma are surrounded by steep mountainous regions. The southern side faces the sea, and the Salween River flows from north to south along the eastern border, which is rich in mineral resources. The Irrawaddy River basin in the west has numerous oil fields, and the downstream delta area is a rice-producing center. The dry areas of Upper Burma are suitable for cotton cultivation.</p>
<p>The cotton production in 1939 was 173,000 metric tons, a significant decrease compared to 272,000 metric tons in 1937. This was the result of the British authorities' policy on Indian food supply and the issue of labor shortage in Burma, leading to production cuts. However, in East Asia, Burma's cotton production ranks first, second only to China and Korea.</p>
<p>Rice production ranks fourth in the world after China, India, and Japan, and is the most developed in Southeast Asia. The output in 1938 was 81.6 million metric tons, making it the largest food supplier to food-deficient India, Ceylon, and other regions. Therefore, the fall of Burma would undoubtedly pose a major threat to the lives of the Indian people and exacerbate the British Indian problem.</p>
<p>In addition, Burma's agricultural resources include sesame and peanuts, with substantial annual exports.</p>
<p>Burmese oil, like rice, has always been a source of energy for India. In 1938, it produced 264 million gallons of crude oil, mainly in Annayatwen, Singu Island, Annayatwen, Lanywa, Indaw, Minbu, Chindwin, and Swemyo. It accounts for 4% of the world's production. The British Burma Oil Company holds a monopoly position, with subsidiaries such as Anglo-Burma Oil Company and Indo-Burma Petroleum Company, which are also quite powerful. In terms of equipment, Indo-Burma Petroleum Company is the most advanced. Oil is transported from the Indaw oilfield to the Pensa refinery, a distance of 27 miles. The Singu and Annayatwen oilfields are connected by a 4-inch pipeline, Singu and Annayatwen by an 8-inch pipeline, and Annayatwen to the Syriam refinery on the banks of the Rangoon River, a distance of 275 miles, by a 10-inch pipeline. In the Rangoon area, Anglo-Burma Oil Company produces approximately 2,500 barrels of oil per day, while Burma Oil Company produces approximately 2,000 barrels. The main product is kerosene, followed by motor gasoline. Due to equipment limitations, the production of aviation fuel is limited and of poor quality.</p>
<p>In terms of forestry, teak (suitable for shipbuilding) is the primary product. The estimated forest area is over 70 million acres, of which 22.2 million acres are protected forests directly under government control. The British government's revenue from forestry is considerable, and it directly and indirectly employs approximately 425,000 people, ranking third after agriculture and the textile industry. The majority of forest products are also exported to India.</p>
<p>Burma also has substantial production of tungsten, cobalt, nickel, and lead, which are crucial for the process of heavy industrialization. Tungsten production is 5,000 tons, second only to China's 12,000 tons, ranking second in the world. Cobalt production holds a monopoly position, on par with Canada outside of Africa. It also ranks first in East Asia. Nickel production is 900 tons, which is significantly less than Canada's 63,000 tons and New Caledonia's 8,000 tons. However, it can supply almost one-third of Japan's needs. (Japan's demand before 1935 was 2,500 to 3,000 tons). Lead production is approximately 83,000 metric tons, supplying more than one-tenth of Britain's needs. The recent production of these major minerals is shown in the table below. Although the status of oil, rice, and timber in East Asia is relatively low, the production of lead and tungsten is of considerable significance.</p>

<p>(3) Historical Recollections</p>
<p>In the 13th century, during the Yuan Dynasty in China, Burma was affiliated with China. Later, it was sometimes independent and sometimes subordinate. By the 17th century, during the prosperous Qing Dynasty, it became a tributary state of China. In the 18th century, its territory expanded, extending to Siam on one side and Bengal on the other. At that time, Britain was developing India and had ambitions for the countries of the East, especially China. As a result, Burma, located between India and China, attracted the attention of the British colonial authorities, who began to encroach eastward from Bengal, initiating the history of British aggression against Burma.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, British aggression against Burma began more than two centuries ago. The pioneers were traders, and the supporters were the East India Company. The initial center of British trade with Burma was in the Gulf of Martaban and the vicinity of Rangoon. With the development of commerce, British influence gradually penetrated Burma. The rich mineral resources of Burma ignited the covetous eyes of the British, sparking their ambitions for aggression. Furthermore, from a geographical perspective, Burma was the best base for managing India and tapping into the treasures of southwestern China. Thus, within peaceful commercial activities, the ambitions of British imperialism germinated, gradually supported by organized militarism, initiating the annexation and aggression of Burma. After three Anglo-Burmese wars in 1824, 1852, and 1885, Burma was "conquered."</p>
<p>In the early 19th century, the British threat to Burma intensified. To preempt, Burma attacked Bengal in 1824, successively capturing Mymensingh, Cachar, Chittagong, and other places. The British colonial authorities blocked the Burmese army and dispatched naval and land forces to occupy key coastal areas such as Rangoon and Tenasserim. The following year, they defeated a 60,000-strong Burmese army, and Burmese General Bandula was killed in action. The British army advanced to within 15 miles of the Burmese capital, Ava. The Burmese king was forced to sue for peace, and the Anglo-Burmese Treaty was signed on February 24, 1826. According to the treaty, the Burmese king relinquished sovereignty over Assam and ceded Arakan, Ea, Dafoi, timber yards, Tenasserim, and other places to the British. From this point on, the British gained control of important areas in Burma along the Bay of Bengal, and the Burmese king continued to rule only Upper Burma and Lower Burma's Pegu and its port of Rangoon.</p>
<p>In 1852, the British again used the pretext that the Burmese were anti-British and harming British merchants to send troops ashore from Rangoon and occupy the entire territory of Pegu. They formally declared Pegu to be a British territory, merging it with the previously occupied areas to form the province of Lower Burma, directly under the Indian government. At that time, the Burmese king was powerless to reclaim it and merely declared his opposition. Ten years later (1862), diplomatic relations between Britain and Burma were restored, but the issue was not addressed, implicitly recognizing Pegu's annexation by Britain. In 1867, Britain and Burma signed the Manchester Treaty, restoring all trade and diplomatic relations. In reality, Britain had already seized control of Burma and began to act as it pleased.</p>
<p>In 1878, the new Burmese King Thibaw ascended the throne and sought to prevent the expansion of British power by relying on French strength. He also hoped to benefit from the conflicts between Britain and France in Indochina. Therefore, pro-French sentiment prevailed in Burma, allowing the French to build a railway from Annam and Tonkin to the Burmese capital, establish a bank in Burma, mine mineral resources, and transfer the concessions granted to British companies to the French. British imperialism issued an ultimatum to the Burmese king on October 22, 1885, demanding that he cede Burmese diplomatic powers to the British Indian government. After the Burmese king refused sternly, Britain sent troops to invade Burma. On November 28 of that year, they captured the Burmese capital, Mandalay, and the Burmese king was captured. The British designated the existing Burmese territory as the province of Upper Burma, directly under the Indian government. Burma officially became a colony of British imperialism on January 1, 1886.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Burma had long been a tributary state of southwestern China. China had every reason to defend its tributary state when Britain began to annex Burma. However, the Qing court turned a blind eye and instead signed the Beijing Treaty with Britain on June 23, 1886, recognizing British sovereignty over Burma. Britain also recognized that the Burmese could continue to pay tribute to China. In reality, the Burmese never paid tribute to China again.</p>

<h3>Cultural Renaissance Movement  Dongfeng</h3>
<p>This time, the Shenbao Monthly published a collection of short essays under the theme "Today's Shanghai Cultural Scene," which received an enthusiastic response from readers. Due to the limited space in the monthly magazine, not all submissions could be included. We have selected several articles and reprinted them in this newspaper. - Editor's Note</p>
<p>As the flames of war spread across the world, a general decline and gloom has descended on culture, a universal phenomenon. Shanghai, having endured its own baptism of war, is no exception. However, Shanghai has always been the center of Chinese culture, and it remains so today. Moreover, Shanghai bears the responsibility of revitalizing the culture of a new China. Therefore, a cultural renaissance movement is urgently needed.</p>
<p>War is the archenemy of culture, causing immense destruction and often dragging culture backward. For example, Germany's recent total mobilization brought all cultural activities to a halt, demonstrating that culture cannot thrive in the heat of war. However, culture is still what drives war. Without Germany's advanced culture, how could it wage such a large-scale war? Although Shanghai is within the war zone, it also bears a war-related mission. Nevertheless, we can still find time for cultural activities. In short, we must engage in cultural activities whenever we have a moment or an opportunity, because people cannot exist without culture, except in extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>Let's first examine the factors that shape culture, which may provide guidance for our cultural renaissance movement. Historically, culture has always blossomed in an environment of ease and leisure. For example, the ancient civilizations of Babylon and Egypt arose in environments of abundant resources and comfortable living. Moreover, the fruits of culture can only ripen on the flowers of freedom. The academic thought of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, as well as the culture of ancient Greece, surpassed any other era in their development, primarily due to freedom of thought. More recently, Peking University, the birthplace of China's New Culture Movement, was a world-renowned institution. At that time, Mr. Cai Yuanpei was the president of the university, allowing professors and students to freely express their views. From conservative to radical, everyone could establish their own unique perspective and compete for supremacy, and Cai himself participated in these activities. Thus, Peking University became the cradle of the New Culture Movement, which later flourished and grew, shaping the Chinese culture of today. If Cai had insisted on his personal opinions, flaunted his authority as president, or excluded dissenters, the New Culture Movement would have been crushed. Could it have achieved its current brilliance? We can now draw a conclusion: the formation of culture requires both a comfortable living and a fertile ground of freedom. By measuring the current situation in Shanghai against these two factors, we can prescribe the right medicine and potentially achieve twice the results with half the effort in our current cultural renaissance movement.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, all cultural groups and organizations in Shanghai have disintegrated, and many cultural figures have dispersed, some leaving Shanghai to seek their fortunes elsewhere, while others remain in Shanghai, struggling to survive. In the meantime, various publications have ceased publication, turning Shanghai into a desolate cultural wasteland. At the same time, cultural figures are being tossed about in the high tide of rising living costs, struggling to breathe. Because they don't usually engage in production, they are at a relative disadvantage in this chaotic environment. They spend their days struggling to make a living, barely escaping the threat of starvation and cold, leaving them little time to devote to their craft. Despite this, many admirable and commendable cultural figures continue to work hard despite hunger and cold. However, these people have long been forgotten by the masses, at best leaving only a faint impression in their minds.</p>
<p>Although a few well-known figures are loudly calling for help for cultural figures, their calls have received little response. For example, the Shanghai News' Grain Loan program was fully funded by a single anonymous donor in the first phase. Now, the second phase has begun, but funding has yet to be secured and fundraising is still underway. Yet, the Shanghai public is quite enthusiastic about charitable causes, often donating millions at a time. Why is it so difficult to raise a mere hundred thousand yuan for the Grain Loan program? This shows that the general public has long forgotten cultural figures.</p>
<p>If we want to revive culture, we must awaken the public's attention and support. Culture relies on the support of the masses; without the support of the masses, how can culture arise? In addition to public support, culture also needs a fertile ground of freedom, allowing it to branch out and grow, as mentioned above. Furthermore, the time it takes for the seeds of culture to blossom and bear fruit is uncertain. Often, the trees planted by the previous generation provide shade for the next. Therefore, we should not expect too much from the fruits of culture, and we must not try to force growth. We only need to water and weed it from time to time. Therefore, we hope that cultural activities will involve less political elements, be freely organized by the people, and receive assistance and ample freedom from the government. Then, the flowers of culture will surely spread across Shanghai.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, if the public can support the cultural renaissance movement and the government can provide assistance from the sidelines, then our cultural figures should redouble their efforts, not belittle themselves, and not sit in their ivory towers like before, creating works for self-admiration. They should assess the current environment and world trends, thoroughly abandon their past decadence, arrogance, disorganization, jealousy, and other bad habits, and work diligently. Then, the cultural renaissance can be anticipated.</p>
<h3>Liquid Fuel in Central China;</h3>
<p>Using Oil Sludge to Refine Gasoline Substitute;</p>
<p>Mr. Hibi Toshio, the author of this article, is the director of the Nantong Agricultural Experiment Station of the Jiangbei Industrial Company's Agricultural Affairs Department. He devoted himself to researching how to extract gasoline substitutes from oil sludge and achieved success after more than a year of effort. A brief overview of his process was published on page 4 of this newspaper on March 6. We have now translated and published Mr. Hibi's detailed report for our readers' attention. - Editor's Note</p>
<p>We are currently living in an era of fuel scarcity. Coal liquefaction has progressed from the hydrogenation method to a unique stage and is rapidly entering the industrialization path. Northern China has vast coal reserves, so this problem is not difficult to solve. However, in the vast Central China, this problem can be studied from a different perspective, namely by using cotton oil refining residue to produce liquid fuel. Approximately 70% of liquid fuel can be produced from this type of vegetable oil refining residue.</p>
<p>Research Motivation</p>
<p>When I went to Nantong to take office, an insightful person from Nantong visited me and mentioned that gasoline substitutes could be produced from cotton oil. He said that the Cotton Crop Chemistry Department of Nantong Agricultural College had this facility before. After investigation, it was found that the method had not been completed. Therefore, I had the opportunity to study it. Recently, due to restrictions on the allocation of heavy oil and gasoline, the operation of various internal combustion engine ships has been greatly hindered, and the Chinese are also very concerned about this issue. I therefore decided to start research.</p>
<p>About Raw Materials</p>
<p>Central China can produce about 4 million dan of cotton, and Jiangbei, known as the granary of Central China, produces about 840,000 dan of cotton and about 550,000 dan of cottonseed. If all of these approximately 550,000 dan of cottonseed are used to extract oil, approximately 55,000 dan of cotton oil can be produced. In reality, not all of it can be used for oil extraction in Jiangbei and most of it is transported to Shanghai. China produces about 0.1 million tons of cotton oil and most of it is used for food. In the interior, charcoal and cottonseed husk ash are used for cotton oil refining. Lime is commonly used for refining, while caustic soda refining is not adopted due to its high cost.</p>
<p>The cotton oil extracted by the lime refining method is black in color and impure, and cannot be used for food. Therefore, more lime must be added to the crude oil, stirred and heated to precipitate and remove the impurities it contains. The residue containing impurities is commonly known as lime refining residue, or "oil sludge" in China. This substance contains too many impurities and has little utility value. Although it can be used as part of the raw material for soap, because its composition is lime salt of fatty acids, it must be converted into soda soap or potassium soap to be used to manufacture ordinary soap. The operation is extremely difficult, so it is discarded.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Manchuria conducts thorough research on soybeans, its major agricultural product. Not only is the oil extraction industry well-developed, but also the utilization of soybean oil, soybean protein, and soybean cake is studied exhaustively, making it an emerging and active soybean industry. However, the cottonseeds, the major agricultural product of Central China, are not sufficiently studied, and their oil and protein are often simply discarded. This is a very regrettable thing.</p>
<p>Uses of Oils and Fats</p>
<p>With the expansion of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the oil and fat resources of the South are also newly added, especially coconut oil, which can produce 5 million tons annually, of which about half can be exported. So, in the future, it can be supplied to the mainland of Japan and China. Coconut oil is excellent for making soap, and if it is refined, it can obtain an excellent frying oil. Therefore, it is necessary to make efforts to study how to make cotton oil in Central China meet the new uses of the new era. After the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the increase in the production of lubricating oil is an inevitable trend. Four-tenths of it can only be obtained from oil and fat resources, so manufacturing lubricating oil from oil and fat resources has become a current major problem.</p>
<p>History of Oil Sludge Fuel</p>
<p>This history is quite interesting. Before the incident, China's kerosene production was very scarce. Therefore, everyone considered using oil sludge to replace kerosene in the event of an emergency. Therefore, the research on kerosene production from oil sludge was prevalent in research institutes and universities in various places. As a result of the research, Professor Hui of the Central University and Professor Du, the director of the Applied Chemistry Research Institute of Nankai University in Tianjin, made the most outstanding contributions. Nantong Agricultural College, of course, has also been conducting research, but it was interrupted due to this incident, and has only recently been restored. The mainland of Japan is also prevalent in the dry distillation research of fish oil. According to the recent publication of Professor Kita's Research Office of Kyoto Imperial University, by adding lime to the mixture of soap and organic and inorganic impurities discharged from the washing factory and performing dry distillation, an oil-like substance can be obtained. The research has been successful and it has been proven that its composition is very similar to kerosene.</p>
<p>Refining Method</p>
<p>My method uses oil sludge (namely cotton oil lime refining residue), which is extremely cheap and almost waste, as a raw material, and performs dry distillation to cause molecular cracking. This produces crude gasoline and volatile oil, crude heavy oil, and crude mobile oil. Crude gasoline can be used for gasoline engines, and crude car oil can be used for internal combustion engines. As for crude mobile oil, it becomes lubricating oil after hydrogenation. Furthermore, if high-pressure hydrogenation is performed, lubricating oil for aviation use can be obtained. I am currently researching this purpose. The above various substances are all obtained by extracting oil sludge. If cotton oil is used for extraction, the quality of the product will naturally be better, and the operation will of course be simpler.</p>
<p>First, according to the method obtained by Chinese research institutes, oil sludge is used without a catalyst, and dry distillation is performed. In the first four hours, heat to 200 degrees Celsius, and then heat to 400 degrees Celsius for five hours. After this dry distillation, approximately 70% of the kerosene-like substance is obtained. Secondly, according to the method obtained by Chinese research institutes, acidic white clay is added to the oil sludge, and dry distillation is performed in the same way, and it can also be manufactured. However, it takes a long time and does not meet economic principles. Therefore, in addition to the lime and acidic white clay that have always been used, more than 36 kinds of compounds are used, namely oxides and salts of alkali, alkaline earth metals, metals, heavy metals, etc., which are added to the oil sludge to cause a reaction. It was then discovered that there is a certain relationship between molecular weight and the law of molecular</p>
<h3>International Women's Day – Letter to Women from the Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association</h3>
<p>Dear sisters across the country:</p>
<p>As we celebrate this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day, two kinds of feelings arise in us: When we look back at the past, we feel excited, but when we look forward to the future, we feel serious.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts and struggles of the pioneers of the women's movement, over the past thirty years, our women's community has broken free from the shackles of feudalism and gained liberation amidst heavy oppression and various constraints. Today, we have fought for equality in political, economic, and legal status. Furthermore, through our unity and self-respect, we have strengthened the equal status we have won and ensured permanent victory. How can this not make us excited?</p>
<p>However, the mission that the new era has given to our women's community is not limited to gaining equality in political, economic, and legal status. Because a new China is growing, a new East Asia is developing, and the entire world is undergoing new transformations. Standing before this new history, we cannot but realize that what we fought for in the past were rights, but from now on, we will have to bear responsibilities. Saving China, protecting East Asia, and even transforming the world, we women must also bear responsibilities. How can this not make us feel serious?</p>
<p>We have fought for rights. From now on, can we evade responsibilities? Our self-esteem answers us: No! We who are born today are ashamed to evade responsibilities!</p>
<p>Here, with a sincere heart, we would like to offer loyal advice to women compatriots of all social strata, with the following points:</p>
<p>(1) We hope that ordinary housewives will, from now on, unanimously practice thrift. At the same time, severely abstain from extravagance. Because rising prices and difficult living conditions have already formed a serious problem. While the government is planning positive solutions, passive remedies must still be maintained through our own efforts. Educating children is our natural duty, which must not only not be neglected but also be given special attention. Because, from a broader perspective, it directly relates to the quality of the entire nation, how can it be taken lightly?</p>
<p>(2) We hope that women in general professions should, most importantly, strive to enrich their abilities and improve their skills. Strengthen our self-esteem, and completely eliminate our dependence. We should have a belief that it is not only glorious to be loved, but even more honorable to be respected. We must build women's personality on the point of fulfilling obligations to society and responsibilities to the country. We not only hope that professional women are aware of or understand this pursuit but especially hope that all professional women will practice it and set an example.</p>
<p>(3) We hope that women in school will earnestly study and research practical knowledge, seek true knowledge, and use it as the foundation for serving society in the future. In particular, we should know that extravagance is not a virtue, and vanity can lead to ruin. Women in school, from an environmental and economic perspective, can be said to be uniquely privileged. How can they not emphasize self-respect? If you waste time in school, and later society wants you to fulfill some obligations, you cannot, and the country wants you to fulfill responsibilities, you still cannot, then may I ask what the meaning and value of your existence is? In the future, the obligations that our women will have to fulfill will be even greater, and the responsibilities that we should bear will be even greater. More obligations and greater responsibilities will be shouldered by today's women in school. How can women in school be slack in their efforts and not encourage themselves?</p>
<p>(4) We have infinite sympathy for working women. In addition to admiring the contributions of working women's sweat and blood, and their profound endurance of hardship, our only hope is that working women will pay more attention to their health within the possible range. Working women work hard and enjoy little, and can face the world without shame. Therefore, women of other strata should be moved by you and learn from you to make themselves healthy.</p>
<p>When women of all strata progress, when combined, they can generate strength. When that strength is used for society, society benefits. When used for the country, it can invisibly assist in national construction. Today, we should face the new era squarely, accept the new mission, and strive in the right direction and struggle toward the right goal. This is in line with the meaning of celebrating this year's Women's Day. We hope that women across the country will encourage each other!</p>

<h3>The Shanghai District Bureau of the Income Tax Office Begins to Levy Income Tax on Industrial and Commercial Profits Last Year; Implemented and Started Collecting from March 1st</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that the industrial, commercial, banking, and money industries in this city have completed the year-end closing of accounts for last year's business surplus after the end of the old lunar year, and started new business this year after February 9th, in order to collect taxes in accordance with legal procedures and enrich national tax revenue, it has scheduled to start collecting income tax on business profits from various industries starting this month, and has notified all industries to comply. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai District Bureau Announcement on Starting Collection</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Office issued Announcement No. 8 the day before, stating that the income tax on Category 1 business profits for the 31st year will be collected on March 1st in accordance with regulations. Various companies, firms, shops, factories, and warehouses must truthfully declare the amount of profits for the 31st year in accordance with the regulations and on schedule. Tax arrears from previous years should also be reported for verification and handling. Do not delay, this is a special announcement.</p>
<p>Mandatory Declaration and Audit Procedures</p>
<p>The procedures for collecting taxes from various industries in Shanghai are the sole responsibility of the Shanghai District Bureau. All industries must truthfully declare their last year's business profit amount to the bureau on schedule. After the bureau reviews the accounts and audits whether the reported amount is accurate, if it is the correct amount, it will immediately determine the amount of business income tax to be paid and designate payment to the Central Reserve Bank. If it is inaccurate, the amount of tax to be paid will be determined according to the bureau's audit results. The tax collection agency is also the Central Bank. As for tax arrears from the past, they should be paid in accordance with the regulations without error.</p>
<h3>Measures for Allocating Flour to the Noodle Products Industry Are Under Overall Planning; Distributing Certificates for Cut Noodles, Cakes, and Steamed Buns; The Industry is Still Requesting Changes</h3>
<p>Regarding the resumption of flour allocation to noodle shops and stalls, the Works Bureau's materials control department is under overall planning. Generally, cut noodle shops will be issued cut noodle certificates, and cake and steamed bun shops will be issued cake and steamed bun certificates. Residents will exchange flour for cut noodle certificates or cake and steamed bun certificates, and then exchange the certificates for products. However, the noodle products industry is deeply afraid that no one will exchange them, which will cause the unmade flour to be frozen, and the made flour products to rot. Therefore, it is still requesting to improve the allocation method.</p>

<h3>Children's Library Holds a Fundraising Campaign</h3>
<p>To commemorate the 9th Children's Day and to promote the welfare of children, the Shanghai Children's Library launched its establishment, which was prepared by eleven groups, including the China Child Welfare Association, and was established in July of the 30th year. The organization is quite complete and adopts appropriate methods to assist children's education in order to cultivate good citizens. It has a collection of more than 10,000 books. After the 31st year, the total number of children who read was 61,374, and more than 50,000 books were borrowed each month. Borrowing and reading in the library is free. The library is raising funds for the 32nd year and has launched a fundraising campaign. Yesterday at 5:00 pm, a board meeting was convened. In addition to reporting on library affairs, it was resolved to hire enthusiastic people from the community to organize a fundraising committee.</p>

<h3>Improving National Health</h3>
<p>— Optimist</p>
<p>A strong nation must first have a strong people</p>
<p>Compared with European countries, China is always lagging behind in everything, even in the health of its citizens, it is unknown how many times behind. Why does China's mortality rate rank first in the world year after year? Why is China's average age the shortest in the world? Why are Chinese people gray-haired and old before the age of forty? Although there are other reasons included; the biggest reason is that young people do not have sufficient cultivation and training in their youth. In other words, it is because China's sex education is unsound and sports are underdeveloped. Therefore, we young people must conserve our energy in our youth in order to serve the country and society in the future. Otherwise, even if we have profound knowledge, it will be in vain if we cannot bear this arduous work. This is not only a loss for individuals, but a loss for the entire nation. I hereby present my humble opinions below for adoption.</p>
<p>(1) The state should establish youth camps. European countries and friendly Japan have long established such institutions. Germany and Italy have achieved the most remarkable results. The funds are all aided by the state. All young people who are fourteen years old must enter the camp, and it is mandatory. The training period is four years. The courses taught are the same as those taught in ordinary schools, but there are more sports items, and knowledge of sexual aspects is also taught.</p>
<p>(2) Recompile health textbooks, enrich materials related to sexual knowledge. The health textbooks published in the past rarely mentioned anything about sexual knowledge. Even if there were any, it was only a few words! When revising in the future, if this issue can be given more attention, it will also be a small help to young people.</p>
<p>(3) The state should compile and print health booklets and distribute them to middle schools and universities. The Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan spends a lot of money every year compiling and printing such booklets and distributing them to middle schools and universities, which describe the prevention of sexual diseases and the terror after recovery, so that students are aware and do not fall.</p>
<p>(4) I hope that the state will build more gymnasiums and sports fields. In the past, several sports fields in Shanghai were used by blue-eyed and yellow-haired children, and the Chinese had no share. Although some schools also have sports facilities, they are either poorly equipped with sports equipment or very small in area. They are not enough for many people to exercise. Therefore, I hope that the state will pay attention to this, and then the nation will be healthy and excellent.</p>
<p>(5) Hold health lectures and distribute health publications. The lack of health publications in Shanghai is beyond question. Therefore, I hope that when printing in the future, the content will focus on sex education, supplemented by health aspects. The price should be as low as possible, and a health lecture should be held once a week, inviting famous doctors to give lectures in turn. Because other lectures in Shanghai are surging, only health lectures are lacking, so this is also worth promoting.</p>
<p>I hope that the government authorities, the medical community, and all walks of life will work hard to promote the above points to achieve success. Then the nation will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate.</p>
<h3>The Panic of Books</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhiming</p>
<p>In the past, it was said that "tailors and secretaries have no clothes to wear, and farmers have no food to eat." Now it has reached the point where the people in our publishing industry, the bookstore owners, have no books to read, and the bookstore owners' children have no books to read either.</p>
<p>Last year, I talked with several colleagues in the book industry, and my prediction was that there would be a panic of books in the coming school season. At that time, my basis was (1) the business situation of the book industry (2) the inventory of books (3) the publishing policy of the book industry.</p>
<p>Sure enough, not only could other people's children not buy books, but my children also suffered the same fate. Because the panic of books is different from the panic of medicines, etc., we are not hoarding books and waiting for a "good price." We are hoping to clear the inventory as soon as possible. Therefore, other people's children have no books to read, and our children who are engaged in the book industry receive the same treatment in school.</p>
<p>Now that half a year has passed, my prediction is still the same, and the book panic will be even more serious next semester. Therefore, I would like to talk about the three points I based on before, and discuss how to solve the book panic.</p>
<p>(1) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the book industry has been stagnant for a time, resulting in no publishing work at all. At this time, it is completely a method of selling inventory without making goods, so-called buying and finishing.</p>
<p>(2) Books and paper are inseparable. When paper was three yuan a ream, it was a prosperous period for the industry, so the more books printed, the better. Now the price of paper is more than five yuan. At this time, if you want bookstores to print more books and put them in warehouses as inventory, bookstores will never do this. Moreover, bookstores rarely store a large amount of paper like paper companies. Even if there is a large amount of paper, they would rather put paper than turn white paper into oily paper with black characters. Therefore, the current period is when bookstores are printing as few books as possible.</p>
<p>(3) In terms of publishing, taking textbooks as an example, they are all currently state-owned, and the number of types is very small and the printing is also limited. Therefore, if the old version is not available, new books cannot be published, and there is no book to print if you want to print.</p>
<p>Then, does this mean that books will be in a state of panic forever? This is not entirely true. Here are two methods I have proposed:</p>
<p>(1) Is to enable producers and consumers to have prior contact. Bookstores usually print up to 1,000 copies of a book, but in reality, only a few hundred copies are sold. In this way, the bookstore has a large amount of inventory. If the book can be sold at a good price like cotton and medicine, it doesn't matter. However, the inventory of books is mostly counted as "bad debt reserves" in our annual accounting settlement. Therefore, if the school authorities want to adopt any books, they may contact or reserve them with the bookstore half a year in advance. At the same time, the bookstore can set a fixed printing method and notify the teachers and school authorities of each school to register within half a year. This registration organization does not have to be managed by each bookstore separately, but can be jointly handled by the top five colleagues. At the same time, I want to honestly say that the school authorities will not have any sales representatives from each bookstore to contact the school and sell at lower prices. Therefore, in order to avoid the difficulty of being short of books after school starts, the school and the bookstore should have a cooperative effort first.</p>
<p>(2) Printing paper – readers should not dislike the quality, so that costs can be reduced and the source of paper can be increased. Even we insiders feel shocked when we take a thin book in our hands and see that the price is ten yuan. Therefore, the cost of printing a book is very relevant. Bookstores also hope to sell at a lower price. Although books are "spiritual food," people engaged in the book industry also know that they cannot be like "material food," which will be welcomed even if the price soars. Therefore, I have been discussing with several paper mill owners how to provide a low-priced and suitable printing paper. This will not only solve the source of paper, but also reduce the price of books, and increase the amount and types of books printed, which will be beneficial to readers and bookstore owners.</p>
<p>To solve the current and future panic of books, I think there are only two ways.</p>
