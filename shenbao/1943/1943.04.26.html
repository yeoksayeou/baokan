<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論國家興衰之道</h3>
<p>昨天申論國家興衰之道，我們致最大的期待於國民政府之强化，而更期待於政治領導人物之以身作則，纔能領導全民，貫澈良善的國策，使我國漸臻於富强之域。我們認爲國策的確立，政府機構的健全等，固極重要，然而取根本的問題，是排除「虛矯」的習氣，發揚實踐的精神。</p>
<p>「虛矯」二字，在個人修養上已爲最大的病害，因爲習於虛矯，平日滿口仁義道德，臨事不顧信實，久而必致自蒙其害。至於一個政府，若徒然宣佈了炫人心目的政綱·政策，或成立了時髦龐大的機構，而事實上並沒有切實做事，那麼對內是不能取信於人民，對外更不免貽笑友邦。所以我國歷代政論家，自孔孟而下，諄諄告誡於當道的，就不過是一個「誠」字。「湯以七十里，文王以百里，」而終於能夠統一全國，其興盛之道，就在一個「誠」字，也就是篤行實踐的精神。再看近代袁世凱非無雄才偉略，蔣介石非無政治投機能力，但洪憲帝國不過八十三天的壽命，而「抗戰政權」也只能遠遁至「中國之堪察加」去，其原因也不過不能取信於人民昭大義於天下而已。至於英國對印度民族之失信，及英美大西洋憲章的虛僞性，更已激起今日印度全國的叛亂和整個西南太平洋的變色。我們今天所以徵引這許多史實，不過爲着國家興衰之道，在「行百步者半九十」的古訓之下，仍不能不期望政府當局之自我檢討與批判。</p>
<p>自從友邦日本自動改變對華政策以後，對於國民政府之强化，平添了有力的保證，中國人民對此渴望十年的日本改變對華政策，今一旦實現，則應如何虛懷若谷，臨深履薄，把握這可貴的難得的時機，發揮全民政治的力量，正是政府當前最重要的課題。過去或有的牽制束縛，今已無復存在，而六轡在握，必須講求駕御之方，庶可兼程並進。我們感於目前形勢，確爲中國復興之轉捩關鍵，確爲國民政府表現作爲之一時際會，則決策措施，博採民意，開放忠諫之路，屛除虛矯，以期斟酌悉當，實爲政府應具之態度。</p>
<p>爲了實踐和貫澈國策，特別是實現目前保衛東亞建設新中國的一切綱領政策，我們反對不切實際的官樣文章，反對有名無實的官僚主義，反對言行不一致，務使政府的每一個措施，都要收穫美滿的成績。凡是沒有一定成功把握的，雖然是最動人的政策與法令，也不要輕於頒發，輕於施行。這是實踐「簡政」的第一步，這也正是加强政府威信的第一步，否則人民不免有「言行不一」之怨言，而國家政治也永無修明的一天。</p>
<p>在保衛東亞建設新中國的今日，政府所望於全國人民的，無非是矢誠擁護，服從國策與政令，以便集中全國人力物力於政府掌握之中。但反轉來說，站在人民的立塲，則更希望政府本身的健全，首先是一切良善的綱領政策之切實施行，和一切政治支票之保證兌現，特別是在今日我們的國土之內，除了一個國民政府之外，還存着各自挾持一部份領土與人民的渝共政權，我們希望國民政府，對於渝共政權所犯的虛僞無信的罪惡，絕不再犯。這樣，不僅和平區的人民一定可以矢誠擁護，就是渝共區內的人民，也就會望風來歸。國家之由危亡而變爲興盛，未嘗不始於此。</p>
<p>然而人之不自知其過，有如不能自視其面。所以鏡子是少不來的，而鏡子決不只是爲了照出自己面部的醜處，它還有積極的意義，即照見醜處而加以矯正，使醜處完全消失。同時，如果沒有醜處，也可和人家比較，多一層自知之明。在政治上，這樣的一面鏡子，更是少不來的。我們期望政府當局迅速預備一面平正準確的明鏡，這鏡子就是政府方面的行政考查，或監察機關，和政府以外的民意機關。前者在國民政府已經設置，目前只要勤加拂拭，使不失其光輝，使不生障翳，而發揮其忠實與正確反映政治善惡的效能，進而謀求改革和發揚。後者現在還未建立起來，這是當前我國政治上一大缺陷，我們摯誠希望這一個缺陷，早日彌補起來，使我們的政府與人民打成一片，團結一致，只有「權」和「能」有了適當的密切配合，國家政治才會走上正軌，國家也才會由衰而盛，由貧而富，由弱而强，當此內外形勢丕變而有利於我國家民族之時機，我們不能不竭誠呼籲，以待當道之抉擇。</p>

<h3>訪滿任務完成　周特使昨飛返首都　中滿經濟合作問題有具體決定　協力大東亞建高基礎益見鞏固</h3>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　中國自與英美宣戰後，舉國上下即抱最大之決心，與各友邦緊密協力，向完遂大東亞戰爭及東亞民族共存共榮之途邁進。本月初旬國民政府特派陳周兩特使分赴日滿與兩國當局懇談，並考察一切戰時之措施。陳特使訪日任務完成，已於十八日返京。周特使一行於本月九日以訪滿任務完成，由大連搭機返國，飛抵北京，除與當地各方交換一般意見外，並視察各大學及一切建設情形畢，於二十五日上午十時乘機飛返首都。是時赴機塲歡迎者有行政院秘書長陳春圃，首都最高法院院長張韜，糧食部長顧寶衡，首都警察總監鄧祖禹，首都警備司令季謳一，經理總監何炳賢，京市長周學昌，外交部次長周隆痒，實業次長袁愈佺，軍事委員會委員蘇德成，政治警衛總署長馬嘯天，財政部方面由次長陳之碩率領該部高級職員，中央儲備銀行夏秘書處長率領高級行員多人，及滿駐華大使呂榮寰，張參事等共百餘人。一時五十五分飛機由紫金山頭掠過，在機塲環繞，一時軍樂大作，周特使偕隨員相繼下機，周氏雖風塵僕僕，而精神奕奕，並無倦容，與歡迎者一一寒暄後，即乘車返邸休息。</p>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　值茲中滿國交益形敦睦，經濟合作更趨緊密之際，我政府特派行政院副院長兼財政部長周佛海氏爲特派大使，於本月八日由首都出發訪滿，而於二十五日返抵首都。頃據政界人士談稱，周特使在滿勾留十日，爲時雖短，然中滿邦交史上則又創一新紀元。周特使此次訪滿以來，兩國之團結效能更加緊密，關於經濟合作之通貨問題，尤均得有具體的決定，而今而後，因兩國之能充分協力大東亞建設之基礎，當益鞏固，我全國人民，尤因周特使圓滿完成任務歸來，故對於中滿之親善關係，東亞軸心之緊密團結，以及大東亞和平之永建，益使前途充滿無限之光明。周特使訪滿期間，曾遍訪滿洲之政治經濟中心各地，更參觀滿水力發電所昭和製鐵廠撫順煤礦廠於滿洲國之戰力的培養情形，視察極詳，此則更於我國今後之經濟建設，有莫大裨益也。</p>
<h3>晋豫邊境日軍繼續挺進　渝殘軍瀕於潰滅　續有重要軍官率部投誠</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　據山西前綫電，日軍此次對渝第二十四集團軍展開之掃蕩，目前已達最激烈之階段，現正繼續壓縮包圍圈，因此渝軍投誠者日衆。渝新編第五軍軍長孫殿英及幹部將校多人亦幡然來歸，晋冀豫邊區之渝軍現已完全陷於崩潰狀態，茲誌二十四以來日軍之綜合戰况如次；（一）猛攻渝第四十軍馬法吾部之日軍，於澗家莊臨洪北方二十公里附近，俘獲該軍軍需處長侯如庸少將；又另一日軍部隊亦於鵍靈村臨洪西北俘獲渝軍旅團長以下多人，統計西南兩路日軍俘獲渝軍共達三千餘人。（一）突破省境東進之日軍於田家井一帶，在陸軍航空部隊協力下，擊漬該地渝之方第二十四集團軍及新編第五軍，是役渝軍被俘三百，日軍鹵獲山砲一，迫擊砲二，及其他戰利品甚夥。（一）於臨淇平原地帶展開掃蕩戰之日軍刻正猛追渝第四十軍殘部，現已俘獲渝軍二二〇名，鹵獲戰利品，計迫擊砲二，輕重機關槍七挺等。該處日軍另一部隊亦於武家灣奪火鎭陵川東北方二十七公里一帶猛攻渝第二十七軍殘部，該軍第四十五師師長胡長靑於是役陣亡。</p>
<p>（又電）晋冀豫省境前綫電渝軍第廿四集團軍新褊第五軍前在林縣一帶遭受日軍各部隊之圍攻，蒙受重大打擊，近更因華北日軍部隊攻破臨洪，致該軍主力部隊已呈漬滅狀態，該軍軍長孫殿英曾逃往林縣迤西之北家村，但因日軍逐次縮小範圍圈，已絕無逃出之希望，終於二十四日下午投降。渝軍對此極爲衝動，而第廿四集團軍內部之傾軋亦愈烈，如該集團軍司令龐炳助，因暫編第二十三師師長呂朝元於前年參加和平陣營後，即大形恐慌，因猜疑部下將兵，遂於去年初起，卽將該軍幹部之家屬以爲質。又因去年於晋冀豫省境作戰時，孫殿英所部劉月亭之反正，故對孫殿英亦監視極嚴，因之龐孫閒之關係遂趨惡化，以致軍紀紊亂，威令不行，且對孫殿英所部停止武器彈藥食糧被服等之補給。</p>
<p>東京廿五日中央社電　據南部太行山前綫電，渝系第廿四集團軍第廿四師師長劉月亭，已於廿四日在臨洪西方八公里之李家寨地方向日軍投降。此外孫殿英所部「第三師」師長王遂慶，第四師師長王延瑛，似亦在臨洪西北方山地爲日軍俘虜。</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　據山西前綫電，渝「第二十五集團軍」此次新編第五軍軍長孫殿英投降，及第二十七軍第四十五師師長胡長靑陣亡，巳瀕於漬滅狀態，頃據被俘渝軍稱，渝「第四十軍」主力於遭日軍西進部隊之致命打擊後，該軍軍長馬法吾僅以身免，偕護兵數名逃往距臨洪迤西十公里之田家井附近山岳地帶。</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　據晋冀豫省境前綫二十五日來電，渝軍第二十四集團軍主力約四萬人已在臨洪西北地區被日軍包圍，雖曾企圖突圍，竭方反攻，但卒被日軍擊潰。當廿四日上午一時許，渝軍第一百零六師一部約千人，意圖突破日軍包圍圈，於迫擊砲掩護射擊之下，在鹿家莊翟井南方附近實行反攻，日軍乃即乘機實行突擊，予以重創。另一隊日軍則在鹿家莊北方將徬徨中之渝軍二千人包圍，猛力圍攻，將其完全擊潰。</p>
<p>太原廿五日中央社電　山西前綫某地二十四日電，日軍北進各部隊爲殲滅渝「第廿四集團軍新編第五軍」起見，於二十日深夜，沿京漢綫開始猛攻，克復峻險，一路進擊，二十三日正午即突入渝軍據點臨淇，圍殲殘餘渝軍，二十四日渝軍長孫殿英投誠，並俘渝軍三千餘名。至此渝「新編第五軍」現已瀕於潰滅，少數殘部，潛匿臨洪附近各村落，日軍爲將其一網打盡，復於廿四日晚展開掃蕩戰，以期一舉殲滅。</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　據晋南前綫電，日軍部隊於臨洪東北之南平田家井附近省境山岳地帶，包圍渝軍約一萬，對之展開殲滅戰。至二十四日夜半，激戰愈烈，渝軍雖屢行反攻，然經日軍猛擊，至二十五日晨，已完全喪失戰意，投降者迭出。如二十四日渝方第四十軍游擊分隊隊長侯如庸少將等投降後，繼之臨洪西北方面，亦有渝方旅長階級少將二名（姓氏不詳）率多數將兵投降，此足證明渝軍指揮紛亂，巳吿崩潰，故偉大部隊之歸順者亦將必至。</p>
<p>孫殿英略歷</p>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　渝方第二十四集團軍新編第五軍軍長孫殿英，因受主席人格之感召，覺悟抗戰之非計，已於日前在該軍防次宣佈參加和運。按孫氏係山東省人，最初爲張宗昌褚玉樸部，由參謀轉任某旅旅長，後投歸西北軍，在馮玉祥麾下任宋哲元部下師長。二十七年中央接受馮玉祥之建議，任孫氏爲靑海西區屯墾督辦，自是轉戰於靑海寗夏綏遠等省，二十七年四月孫離開軍職，其部隊亦經晋軍改褊爲五旅，由北平軍分會直轄。五月北平軍分會任爲高等顧問，後任察北保安司令，最近任第二十四集團軍新編第五軍軍長，性剛直，以勇敢善戰著名。</p>

<h3>日東京新聞社　撰文剖析渝組織　日趨崩潰勢所必然</h3>
<p>東京二十五日同盟社電　此間東京新聞二十四日「時言攔」以「被世界所棄之重慶」爲題，指出重慶之崩潰，勢所必然。全文剖析解說，極爲詳明，茲錄大意如下：「重慶現已日劇重大危險，無論渝蔣等是否自知，但觀其現實情勢，實正日趨崩潰。吾人對渝方此種錯誤。今實不欲再望其反省，僅望中國四億人民及大東亞十億民衆把握此歷史之準確動向而勿誤，溯自大東亞戰爭爆發後，渝方在事實已成英美之附庸，乃猶企圖阻礙國民政府政治力之擴展，及至國府宣布參戰，事態乃更見躍進，新中國在國家領導之下，已決心摧毀渝方，以求復興中國。最近國府之撤廢治外法權及收回租界。已奠定中國復興之第一次基礎。今後隨大東亞戰爭之進展，中國之復興建設，必將逐步推進，而渝方崩潰，自必日益加速。渝方仍未放棄抗戰，且巳爲英美所把持，故其抗戰理念，除依賴英美者外，實亦別無他途。近一世紀來，東亞人屢以自由人道博愛教訓英美，今爲樹立眞正之正義，乃有大東亞戰爭之爆發。抑渝方抗戰之不能救中國，姑置勿論，但其出賣國家民族之事，實巳昭然若揭。至其本質之謭化。可得而言者有三：第一英美蘇三國爲反軸心陣營之主力國。所以戰後問題之解決，勢必由此三國決定。第二因英美抱定歐洲爲第一主義，故可以明其對渝方之存在，並不重視。第三世界情勢現已孕育極大變化，在此未來之大變中，無論如何，渝方之必趨崩潰，乃爲事理所最明顯者。</p>

<h3>日本戰爭科學上的新利器（一）</h3>
<p>九六式十五糎　榴砲彈</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭是科學的決戰。培養擊滅英美的戰月，不放鬆攻勢，堅持戰爭的主動權，從而把握勝利之鍵，有賴於科學，生產，技術各方面的躍進，使前綫軍士有精良而充分的武裝。本月十四日舉行第二次「陸軍技術有功章」，對「戰爭科學技術陣」中有功績者論功行賞，當此決戰之秋，格外有重大的意義。茲選擇其中數則，報吿於下,以見一斑。在大東亞戰爭的序戰中，日軍業已成就了彪炳於戰史的馬來閃電戰，攻略巴打半島，以及新加坡要塞攻城戰等震驚世界的偉績，這自然有賴於陸軍技術方面數十年來潛心研究的結果。使日軍有此偉大成就的最大武器之一，便是野戰重砲中最精銳的「九六式十五糎榴彈砲」。這大砲的威力，現在竟成爲世界的威脅。在緬甸山岳戰，在西南太平洋制霸戰中，日本機械化兵器陣賴此而得奏無敵的凱歌。發明者陸軍第一技術研究所冶口中佐，此次亦榮授表彰。以下爲冶口中佐所談關於該種大砲之概况：</p>
<p>九六式十五糎榴彈砲的設計，發軔於距今九年前昭和九年。當時的世界，恰爲德國宣言重整軍備的前後，軍隊的機械化，漸爲討論的中心。隨着自動車的發達，大砲的行動，從用馬拖曳的時代開始轉變搭載於自動車的自走法時代。這時候各國關於新兵器的研究，保守嚴重的秘密，時地裏進行熾烈的競爭。盟邦德國當時在毫無參考模倣的狀態下，完全從獨自的立塲，打開遍地荊棘的道路，進行研究。</p>
<p>日本的火砲，本來已經達到了世界的水準。有坂中將的三一式野砲，緒方大將的四五式野砲等，迄今依然當作野戰重砲而使用着，屢創優秀的成績。我們鑒於創造新時代武器的使命之重大，即在睡眠中也不敢片刻停止我們的思索。當時協助我研究者，尙有我的助手現爲第一技術研究所所員飯澤耕造兵技少尉，前研究所雇員木本寅吉君，前大阪兵工廠技師市川行次君等三人。都用全部精力來從事研究。</p>
<p>我們研究的第一點是搭載於自動車上的大砲的緩衝機（彈簧裝置）。相用當高的速度，在不平整的地面上疾駛的自動車，與原來用馬拖曳的塲合不同，大砲的細巧部份，容易因顚簸而破損，於是有一種裝置，使大砲在疾駛時不致跳躍，而且其進行時的姿勢，當迅急須轉變射擊姿勢的塲合，又必須預備另一種極簡單的彈簧裝置。這種緩衝機的能否成功，可說是大砲的生命，而且大砲的命中效率，亦與有重大關係。大砲無論在怎樣的速度中運行，侖中效率比一切都來得重要。繼前人未竟之功，我們的研究，雖然這樣簡單，但也逢到了難關。現在所需要研究的，是怎樣調和大砲的重量和威力。我們所造的新的大砲，因爲是野戰重砲，所以其行動務求輕快。可是射程愈大，砲彈的初發必須愈速，而砲身愈大，所給與砲彈的力亦愈强，故而其重量亦必須相當沉重。於是一方面要求其行動輕快，一方面要求砲身大而重，是很難調和的。</p>
<p>現在這種十五糎榴彈砲，其重量大概四噸至五噸，砲彈的重量大約四十公斤，射程普通自一萬二千至一萬五千公尺。我們所完成的大砲，其性能與此標準比較起來，毫無遜色，確是很完美的創造。</p>
<p>這是昭和十二年夏的事情。經過幾度的試造後，我們的努力，終於上獲天佑，而得了報酬，成就了三年來研究的結晶。是年夏，歷史性的中國事變，在華北燃起了烽火。鑒於試騐的結果，軍當局業已決定採用這種重砲。當時造成的祇有〇門然而這是絕好的機會。昭和十二年九月，我帶了自己造成的大砲運至大沽，立於第一綫，九月十四日涿州，保定會戰，竇店鎭附近的戰鬥，就是這九六式十五釐溜彈砲初試身手的日子。那天的戰鬥情形，我將永久不會忘掉。經過幾次實戰的結果，證明其確極完美，幾沒有再要改良的地方了。這重砲的歷史雖淺然與大東亞戰爭中所鹵獲的敵方兵器比較起來，毫無遜色。回憶當時研究完成時的景况，似有神助，對於協力者之不屈不撓的努力，不勝感謝之忱。（翔：譯自四月十六日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>英美軍不顧損失慘生　圖與德軍一決雌雄　德新式虎坦克車隊獲得成功　擊毀反軸心軍坦克車四一輛</h3>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　德官方新聞社昨晚稱，德義軍在突尼西亞點紅南部，順利抵抗英軍之不斷猛攻後，突境戰門之中心，已於星期六日移至軸心橋頭堡之西部地區。德義聯軍，又在梅傑斯埃爾巴勃塞特傑南及布阿拉達各地區，將進攻之英美軍擊退，安特森將軍，自西而沿一百五十公里之戰綫，發動攻擊後，即不顧損失之嚴重，運用其强大之坦克車部隊，以期一決雌雄，但軸心守軍之猛烈砲火，將來攻之坦克車擊散，軸心之裝甲部隊，亦繼之而作有力反攻，數小時之內，反軸心軍坦克車四十一輛，或則被焚，或則被毀。柏林方面稱，此次坦克車劇戰之獲得成功，蓋得力於使用德國新式之「虎」坦克車隊，此項巨型虎坦克車，已經證明非反軸心坦克車所能匹敵。此外軸心轟炸機，又冒密集之高射砲火，擊毀戰綫後方之反軸心坦克車十三輛。艾森霍華將軍總部之路透社記者稱，星期五晨，自恩斐達維爾延展幾達梅傑斯埃爾巴勃之戰門，更爲緊張。美第二軍之一部份，亦加入在自寒特傑南通至瑪特爾之公路南北作戰，軸心步兵，以砲隊協助作猛烈反攻，劇戰仍在北面繼續中。該處反軸心陣綫之極左一端，係由法叛軍所守，梅傑斯埃爾巴勃地區突尼斯公路北之「長停山」及南面之「香蕉山脈」一帶，並有猛烈之戰門，該處戰門之激烈，爲反軸心軍在德包爾巴被擊退以後所僅見。德國新聞社稱，在戰區南段英第八軍所部之紐西蘭軍，於星期五，僅向軸心軍之前方根據地作微弱之突擊。路透社記者，昨晚承認該地區之軸心軍，仍在作極堅決之反攻。德官方新聞社，檢討過去數日間之突境戰事，謂在四月二十一日，德軍突擊進入西面地區之英軍陣地，毀大砲五尊，俘獲四百人，奪獲滿載軍用品之摩托車四十輛。四月二十三日，英軍自西面沿一百五十公里之戰綫，發動攻勢，向東北進攻，但遭德軍奮勇抵抗所阻即轉向東南，現時仍在該處地區劇戰中。四月二十二日及二十三兩日英軍，又在南部戰綫攻擊。四月份英軍之一切進攻，皆爲守軍所破，英軍損失慘重，英軍於四月二十三日冀圖越過在此處，阻斷海岸之山嶺時，結果發生猛烈之肉搏戰，現仍在進行中。德空軍爲協助陸上部隊作戰，曾以快捷之轟炸機，不分晝夜，不斷向反軸心砲隊及高射砲作低空襲擊，並擊散反軸心之坦克車及摩托運輸隊，與反軸心之進攻軍隊，以重大損失。</p>
<h3>安特森所部英第一軍開始發動大規模攻勢</h3>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　海通社軍事特派員訊，突尼西亞大戰已有新轉變，英第一軍現時已開始向軸心橋頭堡之西部戰綫作大規模攻擊，安特森將軍，果然不出所料，係向梅傑斯埃爾巴勃背面之德軍山丘陣地作主力攻擊，但在此處南面之地區，亦有强大之英軍部隊，向東面及東南面推進，更南之英軍，則並有法叛軍協助作戰，此輩法軍，即係在過去數星期間，屢在傑貝爾曼蘇爾地區受挫者。此項部隊，形成安特森將軍所部之右翼，其目標係在蓬杜法斯。該地爲一交通會集地，其對於德義之重要性，一如梅傑斯埃爾巴勃之於反軸心方面。安特森將軍之坦克車隊，大部份係參與攻擊蓬杜法斯，面對傑貝爾安格暨梅傑斯埃爾巴勃之其他山丘陣地作戰者，則係以英步兵隊爲主。反軸心之砲隊，在實力上，本遠勝於軸心軍，且係平均配置於戰綫上，每次主要攻擊之前，先以數百尊大砲，連續急射數小時，故反軸心軍得在各處略有進展。目前反軸心軍軍略上之最大成功，爲在蓬杜法斯以西，及梅傑斯埃爾巴勃東南地區之進展。該處英國軍曾以大量之坦克車作戰，經第一日之戰門後，英軍坦克車隊喪失戰國達總數四分之一，於此可見德軍抵抗堅强而有效。反軸心軍在各處地區，皆蒙　大之人力損失，但以常有新部隊以準備補充，就大體言之，英軍之壓力，於星期六晨，更有增加。沿西部戰綫之全部猛烈之防禦戰，仍在繼續，且愈形激烈，反之在南部戰綫，則敵人之攻擊，顯已較弱，在海岸地區蒙高茂萊將軍之右翼，向北推進，略有進展，但未幾即爲軸心山丘陣地之交射火力所阻遏。英第八軍之中路及右翼，現憶躊躇不進，在星期六正午以前之二十四小時中，反軸心軍之拼死，冀圖突入軸心軍所守之山嶺，反軸心軍繼此次主要攻擊後之停頓，大致僅係短時間之休止，俾得補充軍火，及以新部隊瓜代疲乏之軍隊而已。</p>
<p>里斯本二十五日中曲社電　據倫敦消息，每日快報軍事特派員李却特宣稱，突尼西亞大戰在五月一日左右，並不能有所決定，德軍之抵抗不斷增强，而軸心在突尼斯及比塞大地區之陣地，亦遠較其所預期者爲優，英軍之佔領恩斐達維爾，並無軍事上之重要，德軍非洲軍團對於每一寸之土地，皆極力作戰以爭，故下星期戰門之性質，不難推斷。</p>
<h3>蘇海路援軍　爲德砲隊擊退</h3>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　德國新聞社戰綫從軍記者汗瑪上校，二十四日報吿東綫戰况，謂東綫各地德軍，現正積極展開作戰，蘇軍因於過去數月中在人力物力上，均曾蒙受重創，故不得不在前綫及後方改編部隊，蘇軍欲由海路派遣軍隊至諾佛羅西斯克，但已被德軍沿岸砲隊擊退，蘇軍一千噸級運輸船一艘，亦被擊沉，另有二艘，則受創遁去。</p>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　據德國新聞社前綫特派員二十四日報吿，德軍軍在東部戰綫之活躍情况，謂德空軍曾於二十三日空襲蘇軍兵站及其聯絡路。在庫班地區破壞蘇軍機關車二十五輛。又德戰門機隊曾擊落蘇機三十五架，德容克斯八七型俯衝轟炸機，二十三日並空襲茂曼斯克，北方之克拿斯納耶克白車站及貨物列車，共炸燬二十五輛，又卡達拿克夏南方之哥夫塔車站，亦遭德空軍攻擊，滿載軍需品之列車及機關車十一輛，均受重創，二十三日一日中，蘇軍共在各地區喪失飛機三十九架云。</p>
<h3>美軍損失總數　達七萬八千餘</h3>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　華盛頓訊，美國戰時情報局頃公布美軍傷亡數額，計自開戰以迄四月二十三日爲止，死傷失踪及被俘之官兵，共爲七八·二三五名。此數字內包括陣亡者一萬二千人，及失踪者四萬餘人，同時有美國軍團之華林司令，指摘政府隱瞞北非美軍損失之確數，據戰時情報局主席台維斯在無綫電中答覆云，反軸心軍係於去年十一月間在北非登陸，故美軍在北非之損失，確未超過一萬二千人。</p>
<h3>印度回敎領袖基那　籲請甘地聯合抗英</h3>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　據新德里來訊，全印回敎聯合會會長基那，昨日曾籲請甘地，與該會言歸於好，俾採取共同行動，以抵抗英國之壓迫。基氏之言曰，全國人民何以不宣言團結一致，而將英人驅出境外乎。基氏昨在全印回敎聯合會常年大會中，重行當選爲會長，當塲曾向一萬五千聽眾演說，歷三小時之久，謂不問以往，該會與印度國民會議職資做去云。基氏又稱，甘地之所以不直接與渠通信，實由於英人之挑撥離間，欲使回敎徒與印度敎徒分道楊鑣，基氏最後又言及南非土地限制法案之不公允，謂印人曾被要求對戰爭努力作種種貢獻，而今竟食此報，甚至禁止僑居奈塔爾與脫蘭斯瓦爾之印人，獲得不動產云。</p>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　據加爾各答消息，該處官方，昨日宣布孟加拉省長已任命新內閣，以納斯穆丁爵士爲總理，同時省長並已徵得印度總督之同意，取消其照印度政府條例第九十三節之規定，於前內閣辭職後，署理行政之宣吿。新政府計有十三員，其中七人，爲回敎徒其餘則爲印度敎徒，納斯穆丁爵士兼任內政部長。</p>
<h3>反軸心司令官　力言澳洲危機</h3>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　澳洲方面，因西南太平洋日空軍勢力益形增强，乃深感威脅，竭力要求美國設法增援。據雪梨來電，西南太平洋反軸心陸軍司令官白萊米，曾於二十四日發表廣播，力言澳洲之危機，大意打倒希特勒之意見，吾人亦極贊成，但若將澳洲犧牲，亦屬不合，今日軍在澳洲北方着着增强兵力，致使反軸心軍根據地澳洲，完全陷於孤立，故英美必須不斷運送武器，否則反軸心軍卽無法展開攻勢云。</p>
<h3>英保守黨　將舉行會議</h3>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　據今日英倫消息，英保守黨將於五月中在倫敦舉行重要會議一次，歷時二日。丘吉爾首相將蒞臨演說，按此項會議爲一九三七年以來之第一次，其召集動機，係由於勃羅克爵士與阿斯忒女士，已主持設立保王改進委員會之故，會議討論範圍，將限於國內黨派問題，柏味里尼計劃，社會安寗部之設立，國家統制工業等等問題。</p>
<h3>義報認英在緬敗績　攻緬已成畫餅　英報亦認反軸心國　勢難增强對日戰爭</h3>
<p>邵林二十五日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社訊，昨日斯坦巴報載稱，印度英軍總司令華維爾爵士，現續在緬甸邊境退却，所有克復緬甸之計畫，或可認爲已吿失敗。目前季候風時即已屆，如欲再舉，勢非在六個月之後不可。</p>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　據倫敦來訊泰晤士頃著論述及東亞局勢，謂反軸心各國勢難增强其時日本之戰爭，因反軸心在歐洲及太平洋作戰之關鍵，常爲船舶位及運輸問題，而此兩項又端賴反軸心海空軍之優勢，始獲保障，現駐北非之英美軍隊，需要二百萬噸之船舶艙位方能裝運登陸後之各項接濟，又須數千萬噸艙位始克維持，故在現狀之下，故運輸同樣數額之軍隊至太平洋，殊不可能，因無充分人力及特質進行此距離英倫八千哩之戰爭，須知德軍距離英國海岸祇二十二哩之遙。</p>
<h3>柏林雜誌刋文　論戰爭目的</h3>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　德希特勒總統，最近曾逐次會見歐洲各國首腦，進行各新歐洲之建設。最近出版之柏林羅馬東京雜誌，曾就軸心國之戰爭目的著論，表明實現新歐洲之決意，其大意謂，軸心國之目的，在實現社會正義，公平分配世界之富藏數語，歐洲之文明而觀，希特勒總統與歐洲各國指導者之會見，即可窺知此次之戰爭，乃係爲覆滅舊秩序之革命門爭。吾人如能剷除現在社會之惡勢力，而能獲得成功，將來或不至再有戰爭。吾人業已戰爭四年，或更長之期間，吾人亦必使敵人屈服而後已，軸心國基於正義而戰，定可獲得最後勝利，不久幸福之時代，即可來臨云。</p>
<h3>挪威首相返國</h3>
<p>奧斯陸二十五日中央社電　挪威首相葵士林氏，前曾訪問德總統大本營，與希特勒總統會談，事畢，已於二十四日搭機返國，并電謝希特勒總統，謂余承總統厚意，在總統大本營作有意義之會談，實深感謝，全日耳曼民族自當在總統指導之下，一致團結，努力建設新歐洲云。</p>
<h3>瑞典認美芬　難免斷絕邦交</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十五日中央社電　美駐芬蘭公使館全體館員之撤退，已予歐洲外交界極大衝動，蓋自美駐芬公使新菲爾多歸還華盛頓後，即盛傳美國將於大東亞戰爭週年時與芬蘭斷絕國交。故美政府此次撤退駐芬人員。對美芬兩國關係實有相當意義。據赫爾新基來電。美公使館員前曾陸續移住瑞典，至二十三日餘留之有資格外交官，僅有代理公使，故兩國關係之尚未完全斷絕，亦是事實，但瑞京外交界方面，均認美國政府此項措置，結果兩國國交恐難免斷絕云。</p>
<h3>日泰發表共同聲明　重申戰爭必勝信念</h3>
<p>盤谷二十五日中央社電　日泰兩國，於今日上午八時，就日本靑木大東亞相與泰國首腦部會談事，發表共同聲明稱，日靑木大東亞大臣自四月二十三日起，在盤谷與泰首相畢本外長華德楊數度舉行會談，檢討世界全局，結果再度確認戰爭必勝之信念，及兩國運命相共，團結一致，關於兩國爲完成戰爭及建設大東亞所採方針，雙方意見業已完全一致云。</p>
<p>盤谷二十五日中央社電　日靑木大東亞相，二十四日下午七時，特宴請泰外相華德揚，靑木氏即席致辭，大意謂，余來此間時日雖少，而得與畢本首相數次懇談，並與閣下之間，對於東亞情勢及其他之意見，亦均完全一致實感欣快，且因此次會談，吾等之必勝信念亦愈加强，對於兩國爲完成戰爭及建設大東亞應採之方策，均能深切諒解一事，尤感愉快。繼之泰外相華德揚致答辭，大意謂閣下此次來訪泰國，實爲東來政治史上之偉舉，意義殊大，閣下能充分利用此短促時日，與我國檢討重大問題，其結果不但已促進泰日兩國之新善關係，且在大東亞建設上，亦殊具重大意義。</p>
<p>盤谷二十五日中央社電　泰國朝野，對日靑木大東亞相此次蒞泰訊問，一致表示歡迎，溯自大東亞戰爭發生以來，泰國即以盟國資格，與日本並肩作戰，以打倒英美，建設東亞新秩序，日靑木大東亞相此次蒞泰訊問，說明日本爭取最後勝利之決心，並曾坦白表示日本對泰國之友情，此間一般人士，對此頗表歡迎，以爲日泰友好關係，必將因此而更爲鞏固。同時兩國協力關係亦必將因此更趨密切。茲以靑木大東亞相在會晤泰畢本首相華德揚外相時，曾再度確認日本與泰國，在同生共死之運命下，俱負共同之使命。對於今後日泰兩國緊密協力，爲完成大東亞戰爭及建設大東亞共榮圈所應採取之方策，雙方意見亦已完全一致。故青木大東亞相之訪問泰國，可謂已獲有莫大收獲。又青木大東亞相曾數次與日駐泰坪上大使及大東亞省當地機關磋商要務，并與當地軍事當局舉行懇談，以疏通中央與當地之意見，是以青木大東亞相訪問泰國後，日泰協力關係。必將更趨緊密，此實深堪期待云。</p>

<p>四月二日　今天走着的山坡，其險阻比昨天有過而無不及。約走上了一千公尺光景，就抵達我軍的山砲陣地。在馱馬也不能通行的這條山路上，找着笨重的砲身來到這裏，山砲隊的勞苦，怎么也說不盡的。從這裏可以瞭望孟加拉灣，沿着海岸有一條汽車路，敵人的汽車盛行往來着，看得非常淸楚。我方的山砲打過去時，是根容易命中的。繼續前進，終於到達可以東望馬　　　　　　自馬　半島東南方面，爲進迫敵人向北來的〇〇部隊，已把敵人的退路遮斷，敵印度十四師的英印兵，狼狽不堪，濫於其砲，急求退路。雖然，敵人砲彈的豐富，實可驚人，或者因爲嫌其在退却時太多不便，故欲急速放完以便退却，也未可知，然而無論如何，實在是亂放亂射的。部隊本部的位置，更不知在那裏，這時敵我雙方雜亂，而且敵殘兵橫行，我們的行動陷於絕對危險。正巧碰到了有到部隊本部去的隊伍，我們就跟着而去。正以爲已是最前綫了，那知那個隊伍忽然裝上刺刀，衝向前面去了。我們不能追上去，只得　　　　　　敵人的　　發出呼呼的聲音，飛過我們的頭上。機關槍的聲音，也頻作不絕。我們走來走去摸索着，一直到淸晨六點半，找不到本部的所在。如再這樣地下去，等到天在亮時，那末愈加危險了，不得已只好暫時後退，找到一座小由中的戰壕裏云躱避。</p>
<p>四月三日　日間完全不能行動，只得在戰壕中度過。但在這裏不能做食，從昨天早上吃了一頓之後，一直餓到此刻，所以非設法追及本部不可。然而會集在這裏的總兵力，不滿三十名，而且是以通信兵爲主的，非到了夜裏，前進是相當危險的。并且昨天還通元的從這裏到　市的電話綫，也似乎已被敵兵割斷，襲結巴不可能，所以從　方的部隊本部向〇〇部隊，只能靠無綫電來連結，因此也不能知道〇〇部隊的位置，巴　於　立無援的狀況。下午二過　，左　方的　軍，似乎　　　攻擊了，恐怕有敵方　　　到這裏來的危險，因此他從這僅少的兵力之中，抽出警戒兵，嚴重警戒着。大槪因爲那些警戒兵的影姿被右前方的敵砲兵觀測所發見了之故，猛烈的山砲竟向着我們所在的小山轟射過來。起初，砲彈都落在遠處，後來漸次正確，砲彈已落到戰壕中來，背後一帶都有砲彈落下，破征從頭上飛過，呼呼的聲音，震擊耳鼓。躲在壕中，雖覺沒有危險，然而還是不能安心，而且旣被敵人發見之後，再要在這裏久避，也是危險的事。不過要想後退，也非到夜裏不可。約在三過半鐘頭之間，竟打過來一百五十發左右的砲彈，可是幸運得很，我方一個人也沒有受傷。一會兒在前方發見了敵人的殘兵，將校斥堠隊便立刻衝過去，直到天黑還沒有回來，因此我們的兵力越發少了。日間出去布置電綫於謀和〇〇部隊連絡的通信隊，與敵方殘兵遭遇，結果一名戰死，一名受傷的犧牲而歸來了。可是就這樣後退，也還是不可能的。不久，賜　向前方衝過去的將我斥堠隊連絡兵回來了，更且和其他一隊的將校斥堠兵會合，兵力便增加了。大家便決定一齊去衝破　陣，俾即使不能抵達部隊本部，也可和自己方面有力的部隊會合，於是再　前進了。「印定」的部落回洩有攻下，所以我們料到在其前面的高是，一定有我方的部隊在那裏，於是繼續前進，忽然機槍聲大作，向我們掃射，同時從後方的敵砲兵陣地，也向着我　們猛烈地轟擊過來，落彈很正確，在夜間的砲擊中，不易多見。敵人好像在用電話或其他方法通知我們的位置。我們就避到附近的窪地裏去，以待砲擊的停止，可是這砲擊卻繼續得很久，約經二十發之後，方才沈默下來。因爲憤恨之極，就把腳下踏着的敵方電話綫三根割斷，然後躱避於左邊小山的谷間。這時不知如何，已和最有力的將校斥堠隊離散了，大槪他們已那樣地突進敵中去了吧。砲擊已經停止了，可是危險還沒有去，靠着這少數的兵力是不濟事的，只得再退下去。可是日間守駐過的地方，已經被敵人發見了，所以只好退到更後方約一公里半的地方去，在一條水已乾涸的河浜裏停駐下來。昭　　和十八年（民國三十二年）的神武天皇節，就這樣地終日在敵人砲擊之下渡過了。（丁：譯自四月十六日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>印緬國境反軸心軍動態</h3>
<p>近筆印度歸來之某中立國特派員（特隱其名）以印度東部國境方面之視察記寄記者，因英軍當局檢查之嚴密，故所語多略焉不詳。然所軸心軍之動靜，藉此文亦得略窺一二，以下爲該察記中所述者：</p>
<p>綜觀印度歷史，東部國境方面，前此從未有何外敵侵入，故視爲絕對安全，而不引起任何軍事上之問題。此次戰爭勃發後，此方面之軍事價値，瞬卽一變，而成爲反軸心軍所視爲最重要之攻擊及防禦基地。此方面之司令官愛樂溫中將將阿柴姆·緬甸國境方面之情況。事實上日本軍與反軸心軍在此方面確互相嚴陣以待，窺隙以乘。</p>
<p>愛爾溫在緬甸戰役中曾親自體驗日軍之戰術，故每施行訓練以作對抗之計。記者最初所見者爲橋樑之防禦演習，自動車部隊，砲兵隊及步兵部隊互相合作，防禦偽裝日軍之破壞橋樑。其次所見者爲密林戰。密林戰恰如屋中之戰爭，機械化部隊於此無活動之餘地，由步兵任戰門之主要任務。以非常速度突破從林而馳至山嶺，窺側敵人之襲擊行動。彼等稱此部隊爲「閃電隊」。</p>
<p>記者曾視察高射砲陣地，此爲日軍空襲印派爾後第三日配置於此者。記者訪問此陣地時，正在對目標演習射擊。日本空軍其後曾再度出現於此地上空，拋擲傳單以代炸彈，但此傳單對居民似與以極大影響。使居民發生叛亂，雖有英守備之鎭壓，仍襲擊曼浦爾宮，反英空氣極爲濃厚。</p>
<p>加爾各答飛機塲雖有戰門機停駐，但恐懼日本空軍之來襲，盛行擴張防禦設施，在加爾各答有稱爲外廓防禦地帶之區域者，英印軍每日於此施行訓練，駐屯於此。某士官對記者稱：「爲使防禦作戰便利起見，曾建造道路多條，數年後本地方當局對軍隊之建築道路當深爲感謝，但在感謝英軍之前，似應先感謝日軍，因日軍來侵，余等始築公路也」云。</p>
<p>最近印度反軸心軍「奪還緬甸」之聲，甚囂塵上，依記者所見，反軸心軍在演習時似較眞正的攻擊更爲出力。彼等色厲內荏，日夕戰兢於日軍之進擊。（蘇斐亞特電十二日榎本特派員發—翔：譯自東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>勝利的科學　（二）</h3>
<p>汽車代用燃料裝置…三木吉平氏…</p>
<p>發明汽車代燃裝置，特別是薪炭「瓦期」裝置，在汽油不足的今天，發揮了極大的效果。前任陸軍技師而現任汽車統制會理事，三木吉平氏（五十四歲）開始研究汽車代用燃料時，是遠在二十五年前，當時帝都的汽車數目尙是寥寥可數的時候，在這樣汽車搖籃時代，還在陵軍汽車學校的三木技師，就想到如日本一旦孤立，則汽油非全部供給飛機不可。汽車則必須採用代燃品。於是他就開始這樣研究。這眞可以說，他有先見之明。最初他完成了以酒精爲主的代燃裝置，民國八年在世田谷汽車學校與熊谷間，試駛成功。然而這種酒精必須仰賴於植物性原料，每年總要受相當限制，所以更進一步地開始研究使用具有恒久性的物品。當時只有英國有固體燃料裝置，於是僕僕風鏖跑到歐美去考察，經過一番煞費苦心地研究，終於我國也能製造獨具的固體性代用燃料裝置了。</p>
<p>當時汽油非常豐富，汽車也可以由外國賤價買進，就在這樣一個時期，該技師反向孜孜於代燃之研究，結果遭受了許多他人說這是杞人憂天的愚事。甚至於有人嘲笑他，與其研究代燃品，何不由民間大量購買汽油儲藏起來？但該技師決不因此打擊而氣餒而灰心，却不加反駁地繼續努力研究，以貫澈其初衷。先發明木炭裝置，繼而發明薪炭「瓦斯」裝置。民國二十四年終於被政府採用，這樣奠定了像今日一樣的代燃化之基礎。該技師說：</p>
<p>「在薪炭「瓦斯」裝置方面，最費心思研究的地方，却是如何處置由薪炭出來的柏油問題。最初曾準備了數個桶來試騐，但因爲覺得太無與趣，就讓薪炭燃燒了一半，就從這裏產生了一部份可燃性瓦斯，於是就發明了一種特殊盛裝器。我半生幾乎都獻身於代用燃料裝置的研究，但大東亞戰爭下的今天，看見在街上跑的汽車是採用自己的發明，所以心中總在義：「倒沒白費心思」，」。</p>
<p>關於面孔受傷後的整容術發明…齋藤勤軍醫少將…</p>
<p>現代戰中各種武器威力提高的結果，人體所受的創傷也愈益殘酷化，其中傷及面部而成爲極難看的醜容的也委實不少。這類戰傷者的苦惱則遠比其他部份的戰傷者爲甚，因爲這會給人一種精神上的極大不愉快。同時，如認爲把患者的面部單純治好就可以滿足，讓他帶着一個難看的疤痕回到家鄕去，那末這副難看的醜面孔，很容易使鄕問的靑年大衆志氣沮喪，如是就會影嚮皇軍的士氣。現在對於因戰爭而傷及面孔的醜容，已能提出來當作一個重要課題來研究和討論，如何設法治好。然而各國對於這方面的醫治，都一向沒有什麼進步。齋藤勤軍醫少將（現率天陸軍需院院畏），爲了救助這類戰傷者耗費了多年的心血，結果竟發明了醫治受傷面孔的整容手術。過去一向的醫治方法，絕對未顧及到整容問題，而遺留下來一種極難看的面孔，現在還可以替他改造面孔，使之好看，這眞是日本軍隊醫學界的莫大光榮。該少將生於滋賀縣，民國十年京都大學畢業，取得學位後政府派赴德國留學二年，從民國十九年至去年十一月，始終爲陸軍軍醫學校教官，專心在這方面苦苦研究，中國事變爆發後，這類受傷者由於突然增加，於是就正式拿起醫刀從事受傷面孔的整容手術。當年底，該氏設計的手術法得到初步的成功，後來又設計出多種的整容手術法，一直到今天，已經整容醫好了三百五十多名面部重傷者。</p>
<p>面部受傷後的醜形，因爲是破壞力强大的子彈所造成，所以在深而烈的創傷後，就成爲一種極深的傷痕。爲了塡補缺陷部份，要移植身體其他部份的皮肉，這是一件頂不容易的事情。用移植割下來的皮肉方法，也很難得到成功。因此，在移補前非使用通血方法（有經移植法）則不能成功。同時面部的整形與身體其他部份的整形有所不同，因爲耳朶就是耳朶，鼻子就是鼻子，各有個別的特殊形狀與位置，不能隨意更動與改換，其困難點就在此。齋藤氏對於這一點，一直到今天發明了約十三個手術法。或單獨局部的醫治整容，或各部一起的醫治整容，現在無論如何的重傷，無論如何難看的面孔，都可以醫治成爲好看的相貌。對於初次受到神經創傷極厲害的患者，也經過手術後完全醫好。齋藤氏具有超人的魄力，在後方充當積極　產業戰士。（未完）</p>
<h3>經濟界　評言　都市和農村資金的交流</h3>
<p>都市金融和農村金融，似乎處於競爭的地位，其實很有普通的必要。都市工商發達，產銷流通財貨充足，擔保確實，且負擔得起較高的利息，所以資金的通融較易，運用的範圍也廣。可是，資金集中於都市，流弊所及，馴至投機猖獗，同時因資金的流向都市，農村資金，遂感枯竭，於是農村破產，民不聊生。農民的購買力旣薄，都市的產品，亦至無法推銷，而農村的原料產品也失去了顧主。結果，都市農村，交相窘迫，造成普遍的經濟恐慌。</p>
<p>民國二十三四年上海的金融風潮與經濟恐慌，即原於幾村的破產，因此感覺到救濟農村，實爲不容稍緩。所以自二十三年以後，我們方始積極地推進農業金融，然而已據太晚了。前車之覆，後車之鑑，現在談戰時糧食行政對策者，第一主張『增加生產，以求收穫豐富，充實倉儲，』那末就不能不積極注意農業金融。</p>
<p>然而，農業金融比較不容易辦，政府的倡導而外，還須國家的保護和獎勵，給予低利的資金，保障放款的安全，同時提高農民知識，改善耕種方法，而整個農業金融系統的調整和制度組織的確立，尤爲辦理農業金融必要的策略。農村經濟，得以健全，則糧食的生產，也就不愁不會突飛猛晋了。</p>
<h3>糧部注重民食營業　三省兩市組織聯合會　以滬市爲樞紐　統一管轄東南各地糧政　麵粉油糖等業悉受約束</h3>
<p>上海米糧聯營社奉令籌備，定於明日起至二十八日止，先將社員入社手續完全辦竣，茲探悉各點如下：（一）籌備處地點在愛多亞路浦東大厦六樓六〇六號。（二）辦公時間上午九時至十二時，下午一時至六時。（三）領表人應帶正式店章領取。（四）入社限制暫以經過政府核准營業，取得註冊證或登記證者爲限。</p>

<h3>讀者論壇　解決物價問題的淯底辦法　（三）</h3>
<p>— 仲微</p>
<p>由上所述似應在政府中設立兩個總部門：物資生產監理部和物資分配監理部。部下分作若干重要物資生產部門和分配部門。由於這種以國家爲本位的生產和消費的組織，於是用人問題，乃爲先決問題。政府應當迅速盯定「戰時公務員受賄及貪污懲治條例」無論大小官員凡有違犯條例者都應一律治罪。經營囤積與包庇囤積者無論其爲官，爲商，爲民，均應科以最嚴厲的刑罰。「不能自治，焉能治人？」自治的養成，當爲强國的唯一要圖。至於政府所組的各種「調查隊」，「密查隊」等等，應直接歸中央支配，其中可分爲流動性的，便衣式的，半軍隊化的。並應完全以知識靑年爲主幹，以國家民族的訓練爲標的，以養成基本廉潔人才爲標準。</p>
<p>但在另一方面，仍需顧到執法公務人員的生活問題。目前的公務員薪俸仍以二十二年所訂俸給爲標準，依現在物價指數，較戰前平均高出八十倍左右。公務員爲了生活問題，不得不尋找薪俸之外的「外塊」：大者囤集貨物，從事商業，小者受賄，舞弊。在這種情形之下，政治安得跑上軌這？政府應當重新訂定以物價指數爲標準的官俸，並且補助相當的日用品。在日本與滿洲，官員都有優待的特殊配給，早巳實行有年，卓著成績；而我國對於官員尙無養廉之道，這也是我們所當急起力追的。（完）</p>

<h3>譯論　抑制物價的當前課題</h3>
<p>回顧過去二旬有餘的物價趨勢，棉紗，棉布，金子。以及日用品，糧食等項漸次下游，統一公債之黑市，亦告劇落。在物價政策上，實爲堪喜之現象，一般消費者亦得稍展愁眉。</p>
<p>物價漸落之傾向，大體由於左列各種原因。其一爲檢舉上海之囤積居奇，金融界有自肅的傾向，其二，爲上海與各地的物資流通，漸漸恢復。由於此兩種相互關係，把物價壓了下來。檢舉囤積居奇，等於向投機熱淋下一桶冷水：金融界的自肅，緊縮了投機資金。實力不足的投機者，先把自己的商品出籠，一般囤積者也繼之拋出：金融機關積極收回放款，使投機資金週轉不靈，借款利息高漲，因之囤積獲利無多，這些都是値得注意的現象。</p>
<p>再看物資流通的狀態，自從三月十五日，經濟統制權移交國府之後，新統制機構雖不能謂爲完備，然而物資動態巳覺相當活潑。棉布，藥品，機械器具等的運往內地，雜糧等類的運到上海，數量相當可觀。雖不能以物資移動之活潑而視爲物價下降的原因，但流通能正常化之後，物價當然可望抑平。由於各項條件的凑合，物價就有了下游的現象。</p>
<p>檢舉投機囤積，今後仍將繼續進行。金融機關的自肅，當然爲收回不合理放款，限制新放款等等，勢必助長物價低落的傾向。不用繫複的說，抑制物價的施策，在物價趨落的時候比了上漲之時易於奏效。在此時期，國府必然積極努力抑制物價，且爲民衆所熱望不己者。據聞國府財政部更將繼續調查金融機關，掃除其非法業務，此實應該鼓舞歡迎者，可見得國府對於囤積問題確具堅强決心。預料國府當局對於一般囤積行爲，必然嚴厲治罪，投機份子愈將失其投機的機會，唯有此點，是民衆所翹首期待者。</p>
<p>爲了要使物價低落，完成抑平物價，不得不從取締投機囤積，肅淸金融界，溝通物資三方面進行。振興生產，當然是根本問題，但是在急切的條件之下，必先施行上項對症下藥的辦法。唯有用這種綜合的方法，才能抑平物價，安定民生。不厭求詳的重覆提出，就是現在必須行施對於物價的有効辦法。而且目前正是行之得當的時候。爲復與經濟，安定民生，實有不勝期待於國民政府當局者。（雲鵬：譯自四月二十四日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>如何才能產生好作品</h3>
<p>— 譚子安</p>
<p>國府還都巳經三年了。在和平建國的一條路綫上面，政治經濟交化及其他名部門都並行地展開着本位的工作。然而，在文化部門裏面的文藝創作，依然看不見好的作品，這是任何人都不能否認的事實。</p>
<p>上次，日本的文化使節河上徹太郎氏來滬之時，對一位朋友說：東京的文壇正在渴望着看中國的文藝作品，如果有好的作品，要希望儘量介紹。這位朋友另和幾位文化界的朋友談起這件事情，結果都不能找到可以介紹給日本文壇的適當的作品。我雖然不以爲可以介紹給日本文壇的作品在中國就是好的作品，（因爲日本文壇的處境與其現階段，和中國文學的現階段是完全兩樣的，所以東京所歡喜的作品，在中國幷不一定是好的作品。中國認爲好的作品，幷不一定東京會歡喜或可以發表的。）但是，只從國內而言，也是同樣的現狀！</p>
<p>那末，其原因在什麼地方呢？我認爲……文藝作家和文藝刊物的編者以及文藝批評家都有賣任，尤其是作家和編者的責任最大。</p>
<p>所謂好的創作，當然是具有時代性而且有鬭爭性和建設性的作品。然而，要完成這樣的作品就免不了牽碍到政治經濟社會等等之現狀的寫照。因此，許多的作家和親者都以爲是危險而沒有可能的工作。所以作家不敢作，編者又不敢褊，這是不能產生好作品的最大原因。</p>
<p>其實，描寫現實是不是可能的呢？我的見解是這樣：現時是在和平建國的過程中，換句話說，就是和平建國尙朱成功的當中，也就是一切都尙未上軌的時候。因此，不論政治經濟社會等等裏頭的黑暗面也格外的多。然而，這些黑暗面在和平建國途中是必須消除肅淸的，是不容存在的。這種工作，當然期待政府去做以外，民衆也應該起來協力促進。和平建國的工作，幷不是政府單獨可以做到的。民衆的協力促進才有最大的决定力量。那末，根據這種認識和態度上面的描寫現實的文藝作品，政府決不會反對而且也沒有反對的理由。我相信我們的政府決不是這樣黑暗的。</p>
<p>當然，我也承認有許多事情，因爲會牽聯到別的種種，於是站在大局立塲是不許揭露的。但是，這種問題在文藝創作部門裏面，可以說是很少有的例子。况且運用文藝創作特有的婉曲筆致，也可以克服此種的困難，同時亦是其餘部門不能做到，而只有文藝創作才能够達到的特長。</p>
<p>還有，有人說日本方面也要顧慮。不錯，日本現在是極力在幫忙我們的建國工作，因此，描寫現實的當中也有許多地方會牽聯到日本的種種。尤其是日本對中國人的態度而引起的一切，在文藝創作的時候是最有機會提到的。但是，這些我也認爲沒有問題。因爲日本的幫忙我國是誠意的。中國是理解而且歡迎的。所以，站在互助精神上面，中國對日本如果有所批評，也決不是所謂抗日之類。况且，關於此事日本是絕對光明的。河邊參謀長的致日本士兵書以外，最近日本方面常有實罪自己居民之言論看見，這是充分可以證明的事實。</p>
<p>根據上面種種之理由，描寫現實的創作是十分可能的。只要作者對於和平建國是善意的而且是絕對擁護的話。</p>
<p>其次，文藝刊物的編者，亦需要認淸上面的客觀情勢，給予發表的機會。要不然，就是有好的作品，也不能與世見面，於是，創作界也就免不了一天一天地衰落下去。過去幾年中未能產生好的作品，我不敢相信一個也沒有好的作家。作家一定是有的，是因爲沒有發表的機會。如果我這樣的想法沒有錯的話，那末幾年來創作界的衰微，文藝刋物的編者是應該負大部份責任的。</p>
<p>還有就是文藝批評家的責任。雖然沒有值得批評的作品出現以前，批評家的活動範圍自然難免有限。但是，客觀情勢的把握和段階的判斷，批評家是應該比任何人來得敏感的。能够時常發表評論去戟刺作家勉勵作家，這也是幫助產生好作品的一個條件。</p>
<p>最近有一位朋友說過這麼一句話，他說現在的文壇，批評家變爲作家，而作家變爲詩人了。這句話是非常有趣並且值得吟咏的。因爲作家對於現實覺得害怕，不敢創作，於是，就用起抽象的底表現方法去做做詩。而批評家沒有批評的象—作品—，所以自己就開始創作起來。這種現象，無論如何是不好的，無所裨益而且也不會產生好作品的。因爲詩人作家批評家，除了是天才以外，決不得一人包辦的。</p>
<p>根據上面種種的論據，作家，編者，批評家却要認淸現階段的客觀情勢，而站在這個認識上面，放下胆子去努力奮鬥，才能够產生好的作品。也才能够負起新中國文學建設的偉大任務。</p>
<h3>春風帶來的回憶</h3>
<p>— 慕斐</p>
<p>春風，</p>
<p>帶來了回憶：</p>
<p>一年前當桃紅柳綠的時候，</p>
<p>一伙年靑人，</p>
<p>沿着河流和山嶺，</p>
<p>從遼遙的都市，</p>
<p>熬受着風塵和離別的辛勞</p>
<p>憑了顆熾熱的心，</p>
<p>向着向着……</p>
<p>好容易，</p>
<p>血淚的結晶，</p>
<p>一個靜悄悄的夜，</p>
<p>我們完成了艱巨的征程。</p>
<p>前倨後恭地，</p>
<p>我們受人們慰問接待，</p>
<p>歡題會里高亢的歌聲，</p>
<p>招待席上狂瘋的作樂，</p>
<p>帶走了我們的苦悶。</p>
<p>展望，</p>
<p>計劃，</p>
<p>新生，</p>
<p>我們在打算和期待。</p>
<p>一天，</p>
<p>二天，</p>
<p>又是黃梅雨的季節。</p>
<p>誰也遺忘了我們，</p>
<p>被誰都輕蔑了；</p>
<p>我們的歸宿，</p>
<p>祗嬴得伴着破祠堂上的「木主」，</p>
<p>做我們希望的夢。</p>
<p>哭，</p>
<p>呼號，</p>
<p>可是人家衹報答了譏諷。</p>
<p>失望，</p>
<p>失望，</p>
<p>千百萬個的失望，</p>
<p>撫摸創傷的心，</p>
<p>終於，</p>
<p>路又給我們開展。</p>
<p>春風，</p>
<p>帶來了回憶：</p>
<p>讓我祝福</p>
<p>一切被人們輕蔑的人，</p>
<p>一切被人們欺騙的人。</p>
<h3>碎錦</h3>
<p>— 宗文</p>
<p>凡是做一件事情，重組一必須明白事實的眞相，不可在暗中摸索，聖經上說：『眞理能予人以自由，』所以我們要握住眞理拚命去幹，那末，個人才能成功，困難才可解決。</p>
<p>我們遇到失意的事，萬不可灰心，仍要打起精神，細細考察以前種種失敗的根由，來另圖良策，古人說：『山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一村，』不改弦易轍，不打起精神來，是看不見柳暗花明的。</p>
<h3>被摧殘的生命</h3>
<p>— 史亭</p>
<p>爺叔多添一點，</p>
<p>鍋子底上還有兩條焦了的麵；</p>
<p>自從早上頭，吃了一些苞米，</p>
<p>一直還沒有吃過哩！</p>
<p>還有，謝謝你，</p>
<p>替我端端過來，</p>
<p>把鍋子少敲敲！</p>
<p>我的臂膊已經麻木了，</p>
<p>頭也一直在脹，</p>
<p>人有點昏倒倒！</p>
<p>你看，這米袋比我結實，比我重！</p>
<p>我這樣細弱的臂膊，</p>
<p>那裏背得動；</p>
<p>一路上來，</p>
<p>走十步，息三息，</p>
<p>但是，脚仍舊壓得虛腫！</p>
<p>前兩日，</p>
<p>就祗好向放印子鈿的借了一百塊本鈿；</p>
<p>他對我說：</p>
<p>吃點苦頭，</p>
<p>再背幾斗杜米。</p>
<p>等銅鈿還給人家後，</p>
<p>就可以坐在家裏，息一息，</p>
<p>吃幾頓薄薄的苞米。</p>
<p>可是呀！背一趟，</p>
<p>賺不到五六塊，</p>
<p>這一百塊新票子呵，</p>
<p>你想，要跑幾十次來回！</p>
<p>我這條小生命，</p>
<p>早晚要交給閻王爺差來的小鬼！</p>
<h3>麻醉劑</h3>
<p>— 李漢璉</p>
<p>病中，</p>
<p>除去頭的劇痛，</p>
<p>一切的感覺都麻木了。</p>
<p>麻醉劑使我的頭痛也失了感覺；</p>
<p>於是，</p>
<p>一切更麻木了。</p>
<p>然而人們說我病好了；</p>
<p>於是；我跌進了迷惘的深淵裏，</p>
<p>再也沒淸醒的日子。</p>
<h3>反求諸已</h3>
<p>— 周驌</p>
<p>最近，連續在大華影戲院看了三張日本電影片：『新的幸福』，『新雪』，和『劇塲趣史』。心中很感到有幾句話想要說。</p>
<p>並不是：『長他人志氣，滅自己戚風。』祗是爽直坦白的說老實話：我覺得日本影片的水準是比較國產影片的高了不少的。</p>
<p>在現在上海開映的許多國產影片中，要找一張能令人滿意的片子，實在很難。大光明戲院門首的客滿牌常常高掛，並不就是表示在放映的影片的優良和有意義，這眞和『秋海棠』在卡爾登戲院上演一百餘日，每塲都客滿，仍不足表示『秋海棠』是『成功的』一樣。但是，我所看過的三張日本影片，却都能使人滿意（尤其是『新雪』一片）。我覺得：製片者不能全爲『生意眼』着想，也應該去看看別人家的著作，虛心下氣的向人學習，採取他人的長處，力謀自己的改進。</p>
<p>事實上，在一月九日——英美國的影片未遭禁演——以前，有極多的觀衆是英美影片的『影迷』，而對國產影片不願去觀看一次的。這，不能單責觀衆的不愛護國產，從事於國產影片製作的人，亦應該反省一下：何以會有這樣的現象？一月九日之後，從事於製作國產影片的人更應該趁此機會，力謀振作，力謀改進，以雪前此的『恥辱』——倘使肯自認那種現象爲恥辱的話。但是，到現在爲止，將近三個月了，我們祗看見產量方面頗爲迅速的增加，而未見質的方面有多大的改進，是很令有心人爲之嘆息的！</p>
<p>在『新的幸福』一片中，雖然也有戀愛的穿挿，但不是過份的誇張，也沒有把『肉麻當有趣』，恰是增加了情趣，而全片的主題，仍極明顯，題材極有意義，這是値得讚美，値得效法的。</p>
<p>『新雪』一片，把日本國民學校的教育精神表現無遺，演出極別緻，極生動。這種有力之作，在國產影片中便未曾見過。</p>
<p>『劇塲趣史』一片把日本的舞蹈藝術以及劇塲的情狀，生動地搬演在觀衆目前，情節很風趣，很有意義，一點沒有『低級趣味』的存在，這又是國產的歌舞影片所不能望其項背的！</p>
<p>在新聞短片中，又看到了『松竹映畫社』的『大東京特寫』，令人神往，令人感嘆。這種深刻動人，宣揚本國文化的短片，在國產影片中亦不經見。</p>
<p>上面的許多話，有人看來或覺對國產影片指責得過於嚴酷不當；但是，我原是抱着『春秋責備賢者』的態度來寫本文的，而且，所講的話，是許多和我有相同意見的人所要講的話。我們不愛看國產影片；但是，我們並不是生來就不愛看國產影片的人。相反地，我們是極愛護國產影片的，所以，我們對國產影片抱着更大的期望！</p>
<p>記得魯迅先生說過一句話，其大意是：『我們不必將自己的疾病隱瞞起來，隱瞞是無用的，最好的方法莫如將疾病去醫好。』——所以，我嚕囌地說了這些不免有『滅自己威風』的嫌疑的話，我衷心的希望是：國產影片的『勿樂早占』！</p>
<h3>哥哥</h3>
<p>— 田野</p>
<p>哥哥回家來了，——星期日。</p>
<p>跟每個星期日一樣，他的瘦長的影子悄然地出現在門口，沾着一塊塊機器油斑痕的藍布衫褲，包着他的竹竿似的身軀，蓬亂的頭髮下依舊是那蒼白的沒有血色的臉，那臉上依舊掛着勉强裝出來的苦笑：</p>
<p>『媽！』</p>
<p>媽的憔悴的臉上也露出了一絲的笑意，然而媽的年老的心是在呑泣是在流淚的！——哥哥又瘦許多了！</p>
<p>可不是嗎？哥哥才進廠的時候，不是多强壯多年靑的漢子，然而，也就從進廠的日子起，哥哥每一次回家來，以後，媽就暗暗地嘆氣；紅噴噴的臉漸漸變成蒼白，茁壯的身子漸漸地瘦下去，瘦下去，……</p>
<p>人們看見了他，誰都斷定他至少有四十歲左右了，可是，哥哥才只有二十四歲！</p>
<p>一進門，地上就多了一口血。</p>
<p>哥哥無力地坐下來，失神地呆望着地上。</p>
<p>『哥哥！你到醫生那兒去看一下吧！』我們望着他。</p>
<p>哥哥默默地搖搖頭。</p>
<p>『孩子！』媽幽鬱地說：『明天別去了！在家裏息幾天再說！』</p>
<p>哥哥默默地搖搖頭。</p>
<p>『稍爲停幾天也不能嗎？』媽絕望地：『這樣下去，你的身子……』</p>
<p>寂靜。——只有哥哥急促的喘着的聲音。</p>
<p>『那怎麼行？』哥哥終於開口了；『媽！用不着！……我只要好好睡一覺就好了！……沒…沒關係！……』</p>
<p>咳着，他從矮櫈上站起來，從籃布短衫裏，他摸出了兩張十塊的票子和三張五塊的：</p>
<p>『弟弟！這留着買戶……戶口米！要是…還有得…多，…就先…先還對…對過陳大娘…幾塊…錢！……替媽買…買一條小……小黃魚……！』</p>
<p>買了戶口米回來，想替哥哥找個醫生，可是一看到手裏的鈔票，我在醫生的診所門前停止了脚步。徘徊了一會，終於背着米袋回來。—小黃魚沒買到。</p>
<p>順便到對過陳大娘那裏。</p>
<p>『孩子！你得跟你哥哥說，工錢拿到了，多還點兒，大家……』</p>
<p>她的臉孔總是像家裏死了人。</p>
<p>回來，一進門，昏暗的屋子裏就飄蕩着哥哥的呻吟聲。</p>
<p>我黏上了油燈，淡黃色的光照看哥哥沒有血色的臉和躺在牀上的瘦長的體軀，我忽然地驚惶戰慄了，這是哥哥？這是一個人？—活的血肉的人？</p>
<p>我不敢用鼻子深深地嗅一嗅，因爲這……這許多的血塊……喲！……</p>
<p>沒有月亮，也沒有星，黑漆漆的一片。</p>
<p>可是，當天才破曉的時候，哥哥就又要走了。</p>
<h3>在昏黃的燈光下　—悼華兒—</h3>
<p>— 雲岩</p>
<p>在昏黃的燈光下，</p>
<p>我展開帶着你的噩耗底信箋。</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on the Way to National Prosperity and Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discussion on the way to national prosperity and decline led us to place our greatest expectations on the strengthening of the National Government and, even more so, on the political leaders setting an example to lead the entire nation in implementing sound national policies, gradually leading our country to prosperity. We believe that the establishment of national policies and the soundness of government institutions are of utmost importance. However, the fundamental issue is to eliminate the habit of "hypocrisy" and promote a spirit of practicality.</p>
<p>The two words "hypocrisy" are the greatest malady in personal cultivation because those accustomed to hypocrisy are full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, yet disregard honesty and trustworthiness when facing real situations, which will inevitably harm them in the long run. As for a government, if it merely announces dazzling political programs or policies or establishes fashionable and large institutions, but in fact does not do practical work, then it will not be able to gain the trust of the people internally and will inevitably be ridiculed by friendly nations externally. Therefore, Chinese political theorists throughout history, from Confucius and Mencius onwards, have always warned those in power about the importance of "sincerity." "Tang, with seventy miles of land, and King Wen, with a hundred miles," were eventually able to unify the entire country. The way to their prosperity lies in the single word "sincerity," which is also the spirit of diligent practice. Looking at modern times, Yuan Shikai was not without great talent and bold strategies, and Chiang Kai-shek was not without political opportunism, but the Hongxian Empire lasted only eighty-three days, and the "War of Resistance Regime" could only flee as far as "China's Kamchatka." The reason for this is that they failed to gain the trust of the people and proclaim justice to the world. Furthermore, the British betrayal of the Indian people and the hypocrisy of the Anglo-American Atlantic Charter have ignited a nationwide rebellion in India and changed the complexion of the entire Southwest Pacific. The reason why we cite so many historical facts today is simply to point out that when it comes to the way to national prosperity and decline, even under the ancient adage of "one who walks a hundred steps is halfway at ninety," we still cannot help but expect the government authorities to conduct self-examination and criticism.</p>
<p>Since our friendly nation, Japan, has voluntarily changed its policy towards China, it has added a strong guarantee for the strengthening of the National Government. The Chinese people have longed for this change in Japan's policy towards China for ten years. Now that it has finally been realized, the government should be humble and cautious, seize this precious and hard-won opportunity, and unleash the power of national politics. This is the most important task facing the government today. The constraints and fetters that may have existed in the past no longer exist. With the reins of power firmly in hand, it is necessary to find ways to steer the chariot so that we can advance at full speed. We feel that the current situation is indeed a critical turning point for China's revival and a historic opportunity for the National Government to demonstrate its achievements. Therefore, the government should adopt an attitude of carefully considering and prudently deliberating on policies and measures by widely soliciting public opinion, opening channels for honest advice, and eliminating hypocrisy.</p>
<p>In order to practice and implement national policies, especially to realize all the programs and policies for defending East Asia and building a new China, we oppose impractical official rhetoric, oppose nominal bureaucracy, and oppose inconsistencies between words and deeds, so that every measure taken by the government will yield satisfactory results. Any policy or decree, no matter how moving, should not be easily promulgated or implemented unless there is a certain degree of confidence in its success. This is the first step in practicing "streamlining government," and it is also the first step in strengthening the government's credibility. Otherwise, the people will inevitably complain about "inconsistencies between words and deeds," and the nation's politics will never be enlightened.</p>
<p>In defending East Asia and building a new China today, what the government hopes from the people is nothing more than sincere support and obedience to national policies and decrees, so as to concentrate the nation's human and material resources in the hands of the government. But conversely, from the people's point of view, they hope that the government itself will be sound, first of all, that all sound programs and policies will be effectively implemented, and that all political promises will be guaranteed to be honored. Especially today, within our country, in addition to the National Government, there is also the Chongqing Communist regime, which holds a part of the territory and people. We hope that the National Government will never repeat the crimes of hypocrisy and untrustworthiness committed by the Chongqing Communist regime. In this way, not only will the people in the peaceful areas be able to sincerely support the government, but also the people in the Communist areas will come over at the mere sight of its banner. A nation's transformation from danger and decline to prosperity invariably begins here.</p>
<p>However, people's inability to recognize their own faults is like being unable to see their own faces. Therefore, a mirror is indispensable, and the mirror is not just for reflecting one's own facial imperfections; it also has a positive significance, that is, to see the imperfections and correct them, so that the imperfections disappear completely. At the same time, if there are no imperfections, one can also compare with others and have a greater sense of self-awareness. In politics, such a mirror is even more indispensable. We hope that the government authorities will quickly prepare a fair and accurate mirror. This mirror is the administrative examination or supervisory body within the government and the public opinion organs outside the government. The former has already been established within the National Government. Currently, it only needs to be diligently dusted off so that it does not lose its luster and does not develop obstacles, and so that it can exert its effectiveness in faithfully and accurately reflecting the good and evil of politics, and then seek reform and promotion. The latter has not yet been established, and this is a major defect in our country's politics today. We sincerely hope that this defect will be remedied as soon as possible, so that our government and people can unite as one. Only when "power" and "ability" are properly and closely coordinated can the nation's politics get on the right track, and the nation can transform from decline to prosperity, from poverty to wealth, and from weakness to strength. At this time when the internal and external situation is undergoing profound changes and is favorable to our nation, we cannot but sincerely appeal to await the decision of those in power.</p>

<h3>Special Envoy Zhou Returns to Capital After Completing Mission to Manchuria; Concrete Decisions Made on Sino-Manchurian Economic Cooperation; Foundation for Joint Construction of Greater East Asia Steadily Consolidated</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): Since China declared war on Britain and the United States, the entire nation has embraced the greatest determination to closely cooperate with friendly nations and advance towards the path of completing the Greater East Asia War and the co-existence and co-prosperity of East Asian nations. At the beginning of this month, the National Government specially dispatched Special Envoys Chen and Zhou to Japan and Manchuria respectively to hold cordial talks with the authorities of the two countries and to inspect all wartime measures. Special Envoy Chen completed his mission to Japan and returned to Nanjing on the 18th. Special Envoy Zhou and his party completed their mission to Manchuria on the 9th of this month and returned to China by plane from Dalian. After arriving in Beijing, in addition to exchanging general opinions with various local parties, they also inspected various universities and construction projects before flying back to the capital by plane at 10:00 a.m. on the 25th. Those who went to the airport to welcome them included Chen Chunpu, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan; Zhang Tao, President of the Supreme Court of the Capital; Gu Baoheng, Minister of Food; Deng Zuyu, Director-General of the Capital Police; Ji Ouyi, Commander of the Capital Garrison; He Bingxian, Director-General of the General Affairs Department; Zhou Xuechang, Mayor of Nanjing; Zhou Longyang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Yuan Yuqian, Vice Minister of Industry; Su Decheng, member of the Military Affairs Commission; Ma Xiaotian, Director-General of the Political Security Bureau; Chen Zhishuo, Vice Minister of Finance, leading senior officials of the ministry; Xia, Chief Secretary of the Central Reserve Bank, leading many senior bank staff; and Lu Ronghuan, Manchurian Ambassador to China, and Counselor Zhang, totaling more than 100 people. At 1:55 p.m., the plane flew over Zijin Mountain and circled the airport. Military music was played loudly. Special Envoy Zhou and his entourage disembarked from the plane one after another. Although Special Envoy Zhou looked travel-worn, he was full of energy and showed no signs of fatigue. After exchanging greetings with the welcomers, he returned to his residence by car to rest.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): At a time when the national relations between China and Manchuria are becoming increasingly cordial and economic cooperation is becoming closer, our government specially appointed Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, as a special ambassador to visit Manchuria on the 8th of this month, and he returned to the capital on the 25th. According to political figures, Special Envoy Zhou's stay in Manchuria was short, only ten days, but it created a new era in the history of Sino-Manchurian relations. Since Special Envoy Zhou's visit to Manchuria, the solidarity and effectiveness of the two countries have become closer, and concrete decisions have been made on the currency issue of economic cooperation. From now on, the foundation for the full cooperation between the two countries in the construction of Greater East Asia will be further consolidated. Our people across the country are particularly encouraged by Special Envoy Zhou's successful completion of his mission, so they are full of boundless optimism for the friendly relations between China and Manchuria, the close unity of the East Asian axis, and the permanent construction of peace in Greater East Asia. During his visit to Manchuria, Special Envoy Zhou visited various political and economic centers of Manchuria, and he also visited the Manchurian Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Showa Iron Works, and the Fushun Coal Mine to inspect the cultivation of Manchuria's war power in great detail. This will be of great benefit to our country's economic construction in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Continue to Advance on the Border Between Shanxi and Henan; Remnants of the Chongqing Army on the Verge of Collapse; More Important Officers Lead Their Troops to Surrender</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the front lines in Shanxi, the Japanese army's mopping-up operation against the Chongqing 24th Group Army has reached its most intense stage and is continuing to compress the encirclement, resulting in an increasing number of Chongqing soldiers surrendering. Sun Dianying, commander of the Chongqing New 5th Army, and many officers and generals have also returned to the fold. The Chongqing army in the border area between Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan is now completely collapsing. The comprehensive war situation of the Japanese army since the 24th is recorded as follows: (1) The Japanese army, which launched a fierce attack on Ma Fawu's unit of the Chongqing 40th Army, captured Major General Hou Ruyong, director of the military supplies department of the army, near Jianjiazhuang, 20 kilometers north of Linhong; another Japanese army unit also captured the Chongqing army brigade commander and many others near Huling Village, northwest of Linhong. According to statistics, the Japanese army on the southwest and north roads captured more than 3,000 Chongqing soldiers in total. (2) The Japanese army that broke through the provincial border and advanced eastward, with the cooperation of the army aviation unit, attacked the Chongqing 24th Group Army and the New 5th Army in the Tianjiajing area, annihilating them. In this battle, 300 Chongqing soldiers were captured, and the Japanese army seized one mountain gun, two mortars, and many other war trophies. (3) The Japanese army, which launched a mopping-up operation in the Linqi Plain area, is currently fiercely pursuing the remnants of the Chongqing 40th Army and has captured 220 Chongqing soldiers, seizing two mortars, seven light and heavy machine guns, and other war trophies. Another unit of the Japanese army in the area also launched a fierce attack on the remnants of the Chongqing 27th Army near Wujiawan, 27 kilometers northeast of Lingchuan, and Hu Changqing, commander of the 45th Division of the army, was killed in the battle.</p>
<p>(Another Telegram) A telegram from the front lines in the border area between Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces stated that the Chongqing 24th Group Army's New 5th Army, which had previously suffered a major blow from the encirclement and attack by various units of the Japanese army in the Linxian area, was further destroyed by the attack on Linhong by the North China Japanese Army. The main force of the army was in a state of annihilation. Sun Dianying, commander of the army, fled to Beijiacun, west of Linxian, but because the Japanese army gradually reduced the scope of the encirclement, there was no hope of escaping. He finally surrendered on the afternoon of the 24th. The Chongqing army was extremely agitated by this, and the infighting within the 24th Group Army became more intense. For example, Pang Bingxun, commander of the group army, was greatly alarmed after Lü Chaoyuan, commander of the Provisional 23rd Division, joined the peace camp the year before. Because of his suspicion of the officers and soldiers under his command, he had been holding the families of the officers of the army hostage since the beginning of last year. Also, because of the defection of Liu Yueting's unit under Sun Dianying during the battle in the border area between Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces last year, Sun Dianying was also placed under strict surveillance, which led to a deterioration of the relationship between Pang and Sun, resulting in chaotic military discipline and ineffective orders. The supply of weapons, ammunition, food, clothing, and other supplies to Sun Dianying's unit was also stopped.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the front lines in the southern Taihang Mountains, Liu Yueting, commander of the 24th Division of the Chongqing 24th Group Army, surrendered to the Japanese army on the 24th in Lijiazhai, eight kilometers west of Linhong. In addition, Wang Suiqing, commander of the "3rd Division," and Wang Yanying, commander of the 4th Division, under Sun Dianying, also appeared to be captured by the Japanese army in the mountainous area northwest of Linhong.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the front lines in Shanxi, the Chongqing "25th Group Army" is on the verge of annihilation due to the surrender of Sun Dianying, commander of the New 5th Army, and the death of Hu Changqing, commander of the 45th Division of the 27th Army. According to captured Chongqing soldiers, after the main force of the Chongqing "40th Army" suffered a fatal blow from the westward advancing troops of the Japanese army, Ma Fawu, commander of the army, barely escaped with a few guards to the mountainous area near Tianjiajing, ten kilometers west of Linhong.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the front lines in the border area between Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces on the 25th, the main force of the Chongqing 24th Group Army, about 40,000 men, was surrounded by the Japanese army in the area northwest of Linhong. Although they attempted to break through the encirclement and launch a desperate counterattack, they were eventually defeated by the Japanese army. At about 1:00 a.m. on the 24th, a unit of about 1,000 men from the 106th Division of the Chongqing army, intending to break through the Japanese army's encirclement, launched a counterattack near the area south of Lujiazhuang and Zhaijing under the cover of mortar fire. The Japanese army immediately took the opportunity to launch a surprise attack, inflicting heavy casualties. Another team of the Japanese army surrounded 2,000 Chongqing soldiers in confusion north of Lujiazhuang, and launched a fierce siege, completely annihilating them.</p>
<p>Taiyuan, 25th (Central News Agency): A telegram from a certain location on the front lines in Shanxi on the 24th stated that in order to annihilate the Chongqing "24th Group Army's New 5th Army," the Japanese army's northward advancing units launched a fierce attack along the Beijing-Hankou Railway on the night of the 20th, overcoming steep terrain and advancing all the way. They broke into Linqi, a stronghold of the Chongqing army, at noon on the 23rd, and encircled and annihilated the remaining Chongqing soldiers. On the 24th, Sun Dianying, commander of the Chongqing army, surrendered, and more than 3,000 Chongqing soldiers were captured. At this point, the Chongqing "New 5th Army" is now on the verge of collapse. A small number of remnants are hiding in various villages near Linhong. In order to wipe them out in one fell swoop, the Japanese army launched a mopping-up operation again on the night of the 24th, in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the front lines in southern Shanxi, the Japanese army unit surrounded about 10,000 Chongqing soldiers in the mountainous area on the provincial border near Nanping and Tianjiajing, northeast of Linhong, and launched an annihilation battle against them. By the middle of the night on the 24th, the fierce battle became more intense. Although the Chongqing army repeatedly launched counterattacks, after the fierce attack by the Japanese army, they completely lost their will to fight by the morning of the 25th, and surrenders emerged one after another. For example, after Major General Hou Ruyong, captain of the guerrilla detachment of the Chongqing 40th Army, and others surrendered on the 24th, two Chongqing brigade commander-level major generals (names unknown) and a large number of soldiers also surrendered in the northwest of Linhong. This is enough to prove that the command of the Chongqing army is chaotic and has collapsed, so the surrender of a large unit will be inevitable.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Sun Dianying</p>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): Sun Dianying, commander of the New 5th Army of the Chongqing 24th Group Army, has announced his participation in the peace movement in the defense zone of the army, because he was inspired by the personality of Chairman Wang and realized that the war of resistance was not a good plan. According to reports, Sun is from Shandong Province. He was initially in the department of Zhang Zongchang and Chu Yupu, and was transferred from staff officer to commander of a certain brigade. Later, he joined the Northwest Army and served as a division commander under Song Zheyuan under Feng Yuxiang. In the 27th year, the Central Government accepted Feng Yuxiang's suggestion and appointed Sun as the director of the Qinghai Western District Reclamation. Since then, he has fought in Qinghai, Ningxia, Suiyuan and other provinces. In April of the 27th year, Sun left his military post, and his troops were reorganized by the Jin Army into five brigades, directly under the jurisdiction of the Beiping Military Branch. In May, the Beiping Military Branch appointed him as a senior adviser, and later as the commander of the Chabei Security Force. Most recently, he served as the commander of the New 5th Army of the 24th Group Army. He is known for his straightforwardness, bravery, and good fighting skills.</p>

<h3>National Government Presents Decoration to Friendly Nation; Emperor of Japan Conferred the Tongguang Grand Cordon; Special Envoy Chu Minyi to Present Today</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): The Publicity Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs jointly issued a press release at 3:00 p.m. on April 25th: The National Government has conferred the Tongguang Grand Cordon to His Majesty the Emperor of the friendly nation, Japan, and has specially appointed Chu Minyi, Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as a special envoy, and has appointed Minister Plenipotentiary Zhang Chao, Xue Fengyuan, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Xu Yizong, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as members of the special envoy's entourage. Special Envoy Chu is scheduled to lead his entourage to the palace to meet His Majesty the Emperor on April 26 to present the Tongguang Grand Cordon.</p>
<p>(Another Report) The National Government has returned to the capital for more than three years. In order to commend and honor those who have contributed to the peace movement, the Tongguang Medal has been specially created. On the occasion of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, officials and civilians who have contributed to the peace movement, as well as those of friendly nations who have assisted the peace movement, will be awarded the Tongguang Medal from the special grade to the ninth grade, according to their merits. Government communiqués have been issued several times. Now, the National Government has specially appointed Foreign Minister Chu as a special envoy, leading Ambassador Zhang Chao, Director of the Asian Department Xue Fengyuan, and other members of his entourage, to Japan to personally present the Tongguang Grand Cordon to His Majesty the Emperor of the friendly nation, Japan. The manner of presentation is important, and the significance of the presentation is also very significant. According to reports, when Chairman Wang visited Japan for the third time last year, His Majesty the Emperor of Japan also presented Chairman Wang with the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum, the highest Japanese medal. This time, the National Government specially presented the Tongguang Grand Cordon, the highest-grade medal, to the Emperor of Japan. We can admire the spiritual harmony of the heads of state of the two countries, and the national relations between China and Japan will surely be further enhanced. This is the first time that our country has presented a medal to the head of a foreign state since the Lugouqiao Incident.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Ambassador to Japan, Cai Pei, Gives Talk in Beijing; To Assume Office in Japan Early Next Month</h3>
<p>Beijing, 25th (Central News Agency): Cai Pei, the newly appointed Ambassador of the Republic of China to Japan, arrived here at 4:00 p.m. on the 23rd to inspect the situation in the north before taking office in Japan. At 4:00 p.m. on the 24th, he met with the press corps at the Beijing Hotel and gave a talk. He said in general that he had been ordered to serve as the ambassador to Japan. Before taking office, in order to have cordial talks with the authorities of various agencies in Beijing and the relevant Japanese parties, he specially came to Beijing. Although it has only been three months since China joined the war, the wartime system in the country has gradually been prepared, and is steadily moving towards completing the Greater East Asia War. Japan is also assisting China in various aspects, and obtaining independence and autonomy, such as returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. This is a true manifestation of the true spirit of Japan's moral diplomacy, so it is deeply appreciated. The status of various provinces and cities in northern China has become increasingly important since China joined the war, so its mission is also becoming increasingly important. Today, all of us in China must unite to overcome the current major situation. He, as the ambassador to Japan, will follow the guidance of Chairman Wang on the one hand, and is determined to strengthen the friendly relations between China and Japan on the other hand. The whole country has great expectations for the appointment of former Ambassador to China Shigemitsu as Foreign Minister. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu has been stationed in China for many years, and has made great efforts to adjust the friendly relations between China and Japan in the past. It is firmly believed that the relationship between China and Japan will become increasingly close in the future. He will leave here on the 28th and return to Nanjing, and then depart for Japan in early May to take office.</p>

<h3>Tokyo Shimbun of Japan Publishes Article Analyzing Chongqing Organization; Inevitable Trend Towards Collapse</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency): The Tokyo Shimbun here, in its "Current Affairs Column" on the 24th, entitled "Chongqing Abandoned by the World," pointed out that the collapse of Chongqing is inevitable. The full text is very detailed in its analysis and explanation. The gist is recorded as follows: "Chongqing is now in a very serious danger. Whether Jiang and others in Chongqing are aware of this or not, the reality is that they are moving towards collapse. We do not want to hope that the Chongqing side will reflect on its mistakes. We only hope that the 400 million people of China and the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia will grasp this accurate historical trend and not be mistaken. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing side has in fact become a vassal of Britain and the United States, but it is still attempting to hinder the expansion of the political power of the National Government. When the National Government announced its participation in the war, the situation made even greater progress. The new China, under the leadership of the state, is determined to destroy the Chongqing side in order to revive China. Recently, the National Government's abolition of extraterritorial rights and recovery of concessions has laid the first foundation for China's revival. In the future, with the progress of the Greater East Asia War, China's revival and construction will be gradually promoted, and the collapse of the Chongqing side will inevitably accelerate. The Chongqing side has not given up its war of resistance, and has been controlled by Britain and the United States. Therefore, its concept of war of resistance has no other way but to rely on Britain and the United States. For nearly a century, the people of East Asia have repeatedly taught Britain and the United States about freedom, humanity, and universal love. Now, in order to establish true justice, the Greater East Asia War has broken out. Leaving aside whether the Chongqing side's war of resistance can save China, its betrayal of the country and nation has become obvious. There are three points that can be made about its corrupted nature: First, the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are the main force in the anti-Axis camp. Therefore, the settlement of post-war issues will inevitably be decided by these three countries. Second, because Britain and the United States are determined to prioritize Europe, it can be clearly stated that they do not attach importance to the existence of the Chongqing side. Third, the world situation is now breeding great changes. In this great change of the future, no matter what, the Chongqing side's inevitable trend towards collapse is the most obvious matter of reason."</p>

<h3>New Weapons in Japan's War Science (1)</h3>
<p>Type 96 15cm Howitzer Shell</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is a scientific decisive battle. Cultivating the power to defeat Britain and the United States, not relaxing the offensive, adhering to the initiative in the war, and thereby grasping the key to victory, depends on the advancement of science, production, and technology, so that frontline soldiers have sophisticated and sufficient armaments. The second "Army Technical Achievement Award" was held on the 14th of this month, awarding meritorious service to those who have made contributions to the "war science and technology front." At this time of decisive battle, it has particularly important significance. The following is a selection of several items to report on, in order to see a glimpse of the whole. In the opening battles of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has already achieved the lightning warfare in Malaya, the capture of the Batang Peninsula, and the siege of the Singapore fortress, which are recorded in history. This naturally relies on the result of decades of dedicated research in army technology. One of the greatest weapons that enabled the Japanese army to achieve this great achievement is the "Type 96 15cm Howitzer," the most sophisticated of field heavy artillery. The power of this artillery is now becoming a threat to the world. In the mountain battles of Burma and the battles for control of the Southwest Pacific, the Japanese mechanized forces relied on this and were able to play their invincible songs of triumph. The inventor, Lieutenant Colonel Yaguchi of the 1st Army Technology Research Institute, was also awarded for his achievement. The following is an overview of the artillery from Lieutenant Colonel Yaguchi:</p>
<p>The design of the Type 96 15cm Howitzer began nine years ago in Showa 9 (1934). At that time, the world was around the time of Germany's declaration of rearmament, and the mechanization of the army was gradually becoming the center of discussion. With the development of automobiles, the action of artillery began to change from the era of being towed by horses to the era of self-propelled vehicles mounted on automobiles. At this time, each country was conducting fierce competition in secret regarding research on new weapons, without any reference or imitation. The Allied Germany, in the absence of any reference model, completely opened up a road full of thorns from an independent standpoint and conducted research.</p>
<p>Japanese artillery had already reached the world standard. Lieutenant General Arisaka's Type 31 field gun and General Ogata's Type 45 field gun, etc., are still used as field heavy artillery and have repeatedly achieved excellent results. We, in view of the importance of the mission to create weapons of a new era, did not dare to stop our thinking for a moment even in sleep. At that time, those who assisted me in the research also included my assistant, now Lieutenant Iizawa Kozo, a member of the First Technology Research Institute, Mr. Kimoto Torakichi, a former employee of the Research Institute, and Mr. Ichikawa Yukiji, a former engineer of the Osaka Army Arsenal. They all devoted their entire energies to research.</p>
<p>The first point of our research was the buffer (spring device) of the artillery mounted on the automobile. Automobiles traveling at high speed on uneven ground are different from the original situation of being towed by horses. The delicate parts of the artillery are easily damaged by bumping, so there is a device to prevent the artillery from jumping when traveling at high speed, and when it is necessary to quickly change the shooting posture, another extremely simple spring device must be prepared. The success of this buffer can be said to be the life of the artillery, and the hit efficiency of the artillery is also of great importance. No matter what speed the artillery is running at, the efficiency of hit is more important than everything else. Continuing the unfinished work of our predecessors, our research, although so simple, also encountered difficulties. What needs to be studied now is how to harmonize the weight and power of the artillery. The new artillery that we have created is a field heavy artillery, so its action must be light and fast. However, the greater the range, the faster the initial velocity of the projectile must be, and the larger the cannon, the stronger the force given to the projectile, so its weight must also be correspondingly heavy. Therefore, on the one hand, it is difficult to harmonize the requirement for light and fast action, and on the other hand, the requirement for a large and heavy cannon.</p>
<p>The weight of this 15cm howitzer is about four to five tons, the weight of the projectile is about 40 kilograms, and the range is usually from 12,000 to 15,000 meters. The performance of the artillery that we have completed is in no way inferior compared to this standard, and it is indeed a very perfect creation.</p>
<p>This was in the summer of Showa 12 (1937). After several trials, our efforts were finally blessed by heaven and rewarded, resulting in the crystallization of three years of research. In the summer of that year, the historical China Incident ignited the flames of war in North China. In view of the results of the tests, the military authorities had already decided to adopt this heavy artillery. Only [number missing] were made at that time. However, this was an excellent opportunity. In September of Showa 12 (1937), I brought the artillery that I had created to Dagu and stood on the front line. The battles of Zhuozhou and Baoding on September 14th, and the battle near Dou Dianzhen, were the days when this Type 96 15cm Howitzer first showed its skills. I will never forget the battle situation on that day. After several actual battles, it proved that it was extremely perfect and there was almost no need for further improvement. Although the history of this heavy artillery is short, it is in no way inferior compared to the enemy weapons captured in the Greater East Asia War. Recalling the scene when the research was completed, it seemed to be divinely assisted. I am deeply grateful for the unyielding efforts of my collaborators.

<h3>British and American Forces Disregard Heavy Losses and Attempt to Fight German Forces to the Death; German New Type Tiger Tank Unit Achieves Success, Destroying 41 Anti-Axis Tanks</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – The German official news agency announced last night that after German-Italian forces successfully resisted the continuous fierce attacks by British forces in the southern part of Red Point, Tunisia, the center of the Tunisian battleground has shifted to the western region of the Axis bridgehead on Saturday and Sunday. The German-Italian allied forces also repelled the attacking British and American forces in the areas of Mejez el-Bab, Bou Arada, and El Aroussa. General Anderson, launching an attack from the west along a 150-kilometer battle line, disregarding the severity of the losses, deployed his powerful tank forces in an attempt to fight to the death. However, the intense artillery fire of the Axis defenders scattered the attacking tanks, and the Axis armored units followed up with a powerful counterattack. Within a few hours, 41 anti-Axis tanks were either burned or destroyed. Berlin claimed that the success of this tank battle was due to the use of the German new type "Tiger" tank unit. This giant Tiger tank has proven to be unmatched by anti-Axis tanks. In addition, Axis bombers braved dense anti-aircraft fire and destroyed 13 anti-Axis tanks behind the battle line. A Reuters reporter from General Eisenhower's headquarters said that on Friday morning, the battle extending from Enfidaville to Mejez el-Bab became even more intense. A part of the US Second Corps also joined the battle north and south of the highway from Pont du Fahs to Mateur. Axis infantry, assisted by artillery, launched a fierce counterattack, and the fierce battle continued in the north. The far left end of the anti-Axis line there is guarded by French rebel forces. Fierce battles are also taking place in the areas of "Longstop Hill" north of the Tunis highway in the Mejez el-Bab area and the "Banana Ridge" to the south. The intensity of the battle there is only seen after the anti-Axis forces were defeated in Djebel Bou Kouazi. The German News Agency said that in the southern section of the war zone, the New Zealand forces of the British Eighth Army only launched a weak assault on the Axis forward bases on Friday. A Reuters reporter acknowledged last night that the Axis forces in that area are still making very determined counterattacks. The German official news agency, reviewing the Tunisian battles of the past few days, said that on April 21, German troops launched an attack into the British positions in the western area, destroying five artillery pieces, capturing 400 people, and seizing 40 motorcycles loaded with military supplies. On April 23, British forces launched an offensive from the west along a 150-kilometer battle line, advancing to the northeast. However, they were resisted by German forces and turned to the southeast, where they are still fighting fiercely. On April 22 and 23, British forces attacked on the southern front. All of the British offensives in April were broken by the defenders, and the British suffered heavy losses. When the British forces attempted to cross the mountains blocking the coast here on April 23, a fierce hand-to-hand battle ensued, which is still ongoing. The German Air Force, in order to assist the land forces in combat, has been using fast bombers to continuously launch low-altitude attacks on anti-Axis artillery and anti-aircraft artillery day and night, and to disperse anti-Axis tanks and motorized transport teams, causing heavy losses to the anti-Axis attacking forces.</p>
<h3>British First Army Under Anderson Begins Large-Scale Offensive</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) – A military correspondent for the DNB news agency reports that there has been a new turn in the Tunisian War. The British First Army has now begun a large-scale attack on the western front of the Axis bridgehead. As expected, General Anderson is launching a major attack on the German hill positions behind Mejez el-Bab. However, in the area south of here, there are also strong British forces advancing east and southeast. Further south, the British forces are also being assisted by French rebel forces, who have repeatedly been frustrated in the Djebel Mansour area in the past few weeks. This force forms the right wing of General Anderson's force, and its target is Pont du Fahs, a transportation hub that is as important to the German-Italian forces as Mejez el-Bab is to the anti-Axis forces. Most of General Anderson's tank units are participating in the attack on Pont du Fahs. The British infantry is mainly fighting against the other hill positions facing Djebel Ang and Mejez el-Bab. The anti-Axis artillery is far superior in strength to the Axis forces and is evenly distributed on the battle line. Before each major attack, hundreds of artillery pieces continuously fire rapidly for several hours, so the anti-Axis forces have made slight progress in various places. Currently, the greatest success in anti-Axis military strategy is the progress west of Pont du Fahs and southeast of Mejez el-Bab. British troops have used a large number of tanks in combat there. After the first day of battle, the British tank units lost up to a quarter of the total number of tanks, which shows that the German resistance is strong and effective. The anti-Axis forces have suffered great manpower losses in various areas, but new troops are constantly being prepared to replenish them. On the whole, the British pressure increased further on Saturday morning. The fierce defensive battles along the entire western front are continuing and becoming more intense. Conversely, on the southern front, the enemy's attack has obviously weakened. In the coastal area, the right wing of General Montgomery is advancing northward, making slight progress, but it was soon thwarted by the crossfire of the Axis hill positions. The center and right wing of the British Eighth Army are now hesitant to advance. In the 24 hours before noon on Saturday, the anti-Axis forces desperately tried to break into the mountains held by the Axis forces. The pause after this main attack by the anti-Axis forces is generally only a short rest, so as to replenish ammunition and replace fatigued troops with new troops.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London, the Daily Express military correspondent Lequet declared that the Tunisian War cannot be decided around May 1. The German resistance is constantly increasing, and the Axis positions in the Tunis and Bizerte areas are far superior to what was expected. The British occupation of Enfidaville is of no military importance. The German Africa Corps is fighting hard for every inch of land, so the nature of the battle next week is easy to predict.</p>
<h3>Soviet Sea and Land Reinforcements Repelled by German Artillery</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) – Colonel Hamma, a war correspondent for the German News Agency, reported on the 24th on the situation on the Eastern Front, saying that German forces are actively deploying operations in various parts of the Eastern Front. Because the Soviet forces have suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources in the past few months, they have had to reorganize their troops on the front and in the rear. Soviet forces attempted to send troops to Novorossiysk by sea, but were repelled by German coastal artillery. A Soviet 1,000-ton transport ship was sunk, and two others were damaged and fled.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the German News Agency front-line correspondent on the 24th, the German military's active situation on the Eastern Front stated that the German Air Force bombed Soviet supply stations and their connecting roads on the 23rd. In the Kuban region, 25 Soviet locomotives were destroyed. German fighter squadrons shot down 35 Soviet aircraft. German Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers also bombed Murmansk on the 23rd, the Kandalaksha railway station and freight trains in the north, destroying a total of 25 vehicles. The German Air Force also attacked the Golovata railway station south of Katarinaska. Eleven trains and locomotives loaded with military supplies were severely damaged. On the 23rd alone, the Soviet army lost a total of 39 aircraft in various areas.</p>
<h3>Total US Casualties Reach Over 78,000</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – Washington – The US Office of War Information recently announced the number of US military casualties. From the start of the war until April 23, the total number of officers and soldiers killed, wounded, missing, and captured was 78,235. This figure includes 12,000 killed in action and more than 40,000 missing. At the same time, US Army Commander Huaring accused the government of concealing the exact number of US military losses in North Africa. Chairman Davis of the Office of War Information replied in a radio broadcast that the anti-Axis forces landed in North Africa in November last year, so the US military losses in North Africa did not exceed 12,000.</p>
<h3>Indian Muslim Leader Jinnah Urges Gandhi to Unite Against Britain</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from New Delhi, Jinnah, president of the All-India Muslim League, yesterday urged Gandhi to reconcile with the League in order to take joint action to resist British oppression. Jinnah said, why don't the people of the whole country declare solidarity and drive the British out of the country? Jinnah was re-elected as president at the annual meeting of the All-India Muslim League yesterday. He addressed 15,000 listeners for three hours, saying that regardless of the past, the League and the Indian National Congress will work together. Jinnah also said that the reason why Gandhi did not communicate directly with him was due to the British instigation to separate Muslims and Hindus. Jinnah finally mentioned the injustice of the South African land restriction bill, saying that Indians had been asked to make various contributions to the war effort, but now they are being repaid with this, and even Indians residing in Natal and Transvaal are prohibited from obtaining real estate.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to news from Calcutta, officials there announced yesterday that the Governor of Bengal has appointed a new cabinet, with Sir Nazimuddin as Prime Minister. At the same time, the Governor has obtained the consent of the Viceroy of India to cancel his announcement of acting as administrator after the resignation of the previous cabinet in accordance with Section 93 of the Indian Government Act. The new government has 13 members, of whom seven are Muslims and the rest are Hindus. Sir Nazimuddin also serves as Minister of Home Affairs.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Commander Strongly Declares Australian Crisis</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - Australia is deeply threatened by the increasing strength of the Japanese air force in the Southwest Pacific and is making every effort to request increased support from the United States. According to a telegram from Sydney, Lieutenant General Sir Iven Mackay, Commander of the Anti-Axis Land Forces in the Southwest Pacific, gave a broadcast on the 24th, strongly stating the Australian crisis. He said that while he fully agreed with the idea of defeating Hitler, it would be inappropriate to sacrifice Australia. He stated that the Japanese military is constantly increasing its forces in northern Australia, causing the anti-Axis military base of Australia to be completely isolated. Therefore, Britain and the United States must continuously transport weapons, otherwise the anti-Axis forces will be unable to launch an offensive.</p>
<h3>British Conservative Party to Hold a Meeting</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to news from London today, the British Conservative Party will hold an important meeting in London in mid-May, lasting for two days. Prime Minister Churchill will attend and give a speech. This meeting is the first of its kind since 1937. It is being convened because Sir Brock and Lady Astor have established the Monarchist Improvement Committee. The scope of the meeting will be limited to domestic party issues, the Beveridge Plan, the establishment of a social security department, state-controlled industries, and other issues.</p>
<h3>Italian Newspaper Acknowledges British Defeat in Burma; Offense into Burma is a Pipe Dream; British Newspaper Also Acknowledges Difficulty for Anti-Axis Powers to Increase War Against Japan</h3>
<p>Shaolin, 25th (Central News Agency) - Stefani Agency reports that yesterday's Stampa newspaper stated that the British Commander-in-Chief in India, General Wavell, is continuing to retreat on the Burmese border. All plans to recover Burma can be considered to have failed. The monsoon season is approaching, and any further actions will not be possible for another six months.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London, The Times recently published an article discussing the situation in East Asia, stating that it is difficult for the anti-Axis powers to increase their war effort against Japan. This is because the key to anti-Axis operations in Europe and the Pacific is the availability of ships and transportation, which depend on the superiority of anti-Axis naval and air forces. The British and American troops stationed in North Africa require two million tons of shipping space to transport supplies after landing, and tens of millions of tons of space to maintain them. Therefore, under the current circumstances, it is impossible to transport the same number of troops to the Pacific because there is insufficient manpower and resources to conduct a war 8,000 miles from Britain, while the German forces are only 22 miles from the British coast.</p>
<h3>Berlin Magazine Publishes Article Discussing the Purpose of the War</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - German President Hitler has recently met with the heads of various European countries to discuss the construction of a new Europe. The recently published Berlin-Rome-Tokyo magazine published an article on the war aims of the Axis powers, expressing its determination to realize a new Europe. The main idea is that the aim of the Axis powers is to achieve social justice and a fair distribution of the world's wealth. From the perspective of European civilization, the meeting between President Hitler and the leaders of various European countries shows that this war is a revolutionary struggle to overthrow the old order. If we can eradicate the evil forces in the present society and succeed, there may not be any more wars in the future. We have been at war for four years, or even longer, and we will certainly force the enemy to submit. The Axis powers are fighting for justice and will surely achieve final victory, and a happy era will soon come.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Prime Minister Returns Home</h3>
<p>Oslo, 25th (Central News Agency) - Norwegian Prime Minister Quisling previously visited the German President's headquarters and held talks with President Hitler. After the meeting, he returned home by plane on the 24th and telegraphed thanks to President Hitler, saying that he was deeply grateful for the President's kindness in holding meaningful talks at the President's headquarters. The entire Germanic people will unite under the President's leadership and strive to build a new Europe.</p>
<h3>Sweden Acknowledges that Severance of Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Finland is Inevitable</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency) - The withdrawal of all staff from the US Embassy in Finland has caused a great shock to the European diplomatic community. Ever since the US Minister to Finland, Schoenfeld, returned to Washington, it has been widely rumored that the United States will sever diplomatic relations with Finland on the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, this withdrawal of personnel by the US government has considerable significance for US-Finnish relations. According to a telegram from Helsinki, US Embassy staff have been gradually moving to Sweden. As of the 23rd, only the Chargé d'Affaires remained as a qualified diplomat. Therefore, it is a fact that relations between the two countries have not been completely severed. However, diplomatic circles in Stockholm generally believe that the result of this measure by the US government is that severance of diplomatic relations between the two countries will be inevitable.</p>
<h3>Japan and Thailand Issue Joint Statement Reaffirming Belief in Victory</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 25th (Central News Agency) - Japan and Thailand, at 8:00 AM today, issued a joint statement regarding the meeting between Japan's Minister for Greater East Asia, Aoki, and the Thai leadership, stating that Minister Aoki has held several meetings with Thai Prime Minister Pibul and Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon in Bangkok since April 23rd to review the overall world situation. As a result, they reaffirmed their belief in victory and the shared destiny of the two countries, united as one. The two sides have reached complete agreement on the policies adopted by the two countries to complete the war and build Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 25th (Central News Agency) - Japan's Minister for Greater East Asia, Aoki, hosted a banquet for Thai Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon at 7:00 PM on the 24th. In his speech, Aoki said that although he had only been here for a short time, he had had several cordial talks with Prime Minister Pibul, and he was delighted that his views on the situation in East Asia and other matters were in complete agreement with the Foreign Minister. He added that this meeting had strengthened their belief in victory, and he was particularly pleased that they had a deep understanding of the policies that the two countries should adopt to complete the war and build Greater East Asia. Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon then gave a reply speech, saying that the Minister's visit to Thailand was a great event in the political history of the East and was of great significance. He added that the Minister had made full use of this short time to review important issues with his country, and the result was not only the promotion of the new good relations between Thailand and Japan, but also of great significance in the construction of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Thai government and people unanimously welcomed the visit of Japan's Minister for Greater East Asia, Aoki. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Thailand has fought alongside Japan as an ally to defeat Britain and the United States and build a new order in East Asia. Minister Aoki's visit to Thailand explained Japan's determination to win the final victory and frankly expressed Japan's friendship with Thailand. This is generally welcomed here, as it is believed that the friendly relations between Japan and Thailand will be further consolidated as a result. At the same time, the cooperative relationship between the two countries will inevitably become closer. Minister Aoki reaffirmed, when he met with Thai Prime Minister Pibul and Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon, that Japan and Thailand share a common destiny of life and death and bear a common mission. The two sides also reached complete agreement on the policies to be adopted in the future by Japan and Thailand in close cooperation to complete the Greater East Asia War and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, Minister Aoki's visit to Thailand can be said to have been a great success. In addition, Minister Aoki has consulted with the Japanese Ambassador to Thailand, Tsubogami, and the local agencies of the Ministry of Greater East Asia on important matters, and held talks with local military authorities to smooth out the opinions of the central and local governments. Therefore, after Minister Aoki's visit to Thailand, the cooperative relationship between Japan and Thailand will inevitably become closer, which is deeply worthy of expectation.</p>
<h3>Leader of French Militia Assassinated</h3>
<p>Vichy, 25th (German News Agency) - Garsovski, the leader of the French militia in the Rhone region, was assassinated in Marseille yesterday morning. He was shot and killed by a handgun when leaving his home. The report did not mention whether the murderer had been caught.</p>
<h3>War Zone Journal on the Burma-India Front (2)</h3>
<p>April 2nd Today the slopes we are walking on are even more dangerous than yesterday. After walking about 1,000 meters, we arrived at the mountain artillery position of our army. Finding the heavy gun bodies and bringing them here on this mountain road that even packhorses cannot pass through, the hardships of the mountain artillery team cannot be fully described. From here, we can see the Bay of Bengal, and there is a road along the coast where enemy vehicles frequently travel, and we can see them very clearly. It is very easy to hit them when our mountain guns fire. Continuing forward, we finally reached a place from where we can look east towards the Malayan Peninsula. The XXXX unit is closing in on the enemy from the southeast, cutting off the enemy's retreat. The British-Indian troops of the enemy's 14th Indian Division are in a terrible state, abandoning their artillery and desperately seeking a retreat. Although the enemy's artillery shells are abundant, it is truly astonishing, perhaps because they think it is too inconvenient to carry too many shells when retreating, so they want to quickly fire them all before retreating, but in any case, they are firing and shooting randomly. The location of the unit headquarters is unknown. At this time, the enemy and our forces are mixed up, and the enemy's remnants are running rampant, putting our actions in absolute danger. Fortunately, we came across a team going to the unit headquarters, and we followed them. Just when we thought we were at the front line, the team suddenly fixed bayonets and charged forward. We couldn't keep up, so we had to The enemy's made a whooshing sound as they flew over our heads. The sound of machine guns was also frequent and continuous. We wandered around searching until 6:30 in the morning, but couldn't find the location of the headquarters. If we continued like this, it would be even more dangerous when it got light, so we had no choice but to retreat temporarily and find a small trench in a mountain to hide.</p>
<p>April 3rd We couldn't move during the day, so we had to spend it in the trench. But we can't cook here. We haven't eaten since breakfast yesterday morning, so we have been hungry until now, so we have to find a way to catch up with the headquarters. However, the total strength gathered here is less than thirty men, and most of them are signalmen. It is quite dangerous to advance unless it is night. Moreover, the phone line from here to the city, which was still connected yesterday, seems to have been cut off by the enemy soldiers, and it is impossible to attack. Therefore, the XXX unit from the unit headquarters on the side can only be connected by radio, so we cannot know the location of the XXX unit. The XXX is in a state of isolation and helplessness. At two in the afternoon, the side of the military seemed to have attacked. We were afraid that the enemy would come here, so we took out guards from this small number of troops and seriously guarded it. Probably because the figures of those guards were discovered by the enemy artillery observation post in the right front, the fierce mountain artillery fired at the small mountain where we were. At first, the shells landed far away, but gradually they became more accurate, and the shells landed in the trench. Shells fell all around, and pieces of shrapnel flew over our heads with a whooshing sound, hitting our eardrums. Although we felt safe hiding in the trench, we still couldn't feel at ease. Moreover, since we had been discovered by the enemy, it was dangerous to hide here for a long time. However, we couldn't retreat until night. In about three and a half hours, about one hundred and fifty shells were fired, but fortunately, none of us were injured. After a while, we found enemy remnants in front, and the officers' reconnaissance team immediately rushed over, and they did not return until dark, so our strength was even smaller. The signal team that went out during the day to lay a telegraph wire to contact the XX unit encountered enemy remnants, resulting in one death and one wounded. But even so, it was still impossible to retreat. Soon, the liaison soldiers sent by the general to the front line returned, and they joined other officers' reconnaissance soldiers, and the strength increased. Everyone decided to break through the formation together, so that even if they could not reach the unit headquarters, they could meet with our own powerful troops, so they went forward again. The "Indian" tribe had been captured, so we expected that there must be our troops on the high ground in front of it, so we continued to move forward. Suddenly, machine guns fired loudly, sweeping at us, and at the same time, the enemy artillery position in the rear also fired at us fiercely. The shells landed very accurately, which is rare in night shelling. The enemy seemed to be notifying our location by telephone or other means. We hid in a nearby depression to wait for the shelling to stop, but the shelling continued for a long time, about twenty rounds before it subsided. Because we were extremely angry, we cut off three enemy telephone lines under our feet and then hid in the valley of a small mountain on the left. At this time, we didn't know how, but we had become separated from the most powerful officers' reconnaissance team. They probably had broken into the enemy's position. The shelling had stopped, but the danger was not over. It was useless to rely on this small number of soldiers, so we had to retreat again. But the place where we had been stationed during the day had already been discovered by the enemy, so we had to retreat to a place about one and a half kilometers further back and stop in a dry riverbed. We spent the day, the Divine Martial Emperor's Day of the 18th year of Showa (32nd year of the Republic of China), under enemy artillery fire. (Ding: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 16)</p>
<h3>Dynamics of Anti-Axis Forces on the India-Burma Border</h3>
<p>A certain neutral country correspondent who recently returned from India (whose name is withheld) sent the reporter a report on his inspection of the eastern border of India. Due to the strict inspection by the British military authorities, much of the information is omitted and not detailed. However, the movements of the Axis forces can be glimpsed from this article. The following is what is described in the inspection report:</p>
<p>Looking at the history of India, the eastern border has never been invaded by any foreign enemies, so it is regarded as absolutely safe and does not cause any military problems. After the outbreak of this war, the military value of this area suddenly changed and became the most important attack and defense base for the anti-Axis forces. Lieutenant General Irwin, commander of this area, will describe the situation on the Achaim-Burma border. In fact, Japanese and anti-Axis forces are indeed facing each other in this area, waiting for an opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>Irwin personally experienced the tactics of the Japanese army in the Burma campaign, so he conducted training to counter them. The first thing the reporter saw was a bridge defense exercise, in which motorized units, artillery units, and infantry units cooperated to defend against the destruction of bridges by disguised Japanese troops. The second thing he saw was jungle warfare. Jungle warfare is like a war in a house, where mechanized units have no room for activity, and infantry takes on the main task of combat. They break through the jungle at a very fast speed and rush to the mountains to observe and attack the enemy. They call this unit the "Lightning Team."</p>
<p>The reporter inspected the anti-aircraft gun position, which was deployed here three days after the Japanese army's air raid on Imphal. When the reporter visited this position, they were practicing shooting at targets. The Japanese air force later reappeared in the sky above this place, dropping leaflets instead of bombs, but these leaflets seemed to have a great impact on the residents. They caused the residents to revolt. Although there was suppression by the British garrison, they still attacked the Manipur Palace, and the anti-British atmosphere was very strong.</p>
<p>Although there were fighters stationed at the Calcutta airfield, fearing an attack by the Japanese air force, they were expanding their defensive facilities. There is an area called the outer defense zone in Calcutta, where British and Indian troops conduct training every day and are stationed there. An officer told the reporter: "In order to facilitate defensive operations, many roads have been built. In a few years, the local authorities will be deeply grateful to the military for building the roads, but before thanking the British army, they should first thank the Japanese army, because it was the Japanese invasion that prompted us to build the highways."</p>
<p>Recently, the cry of "recapturing Burma" by the anti-Axis forces in India has been very loud. According to what the reporter saw, the anti-Axis forces seemed to be putting more effort into the exercises than into a real attack. They are outwardly strong but inwardly timid, trembling day and night at the Japanese army's attack.

<h3>Silver and Money Industry Tightens Lending; Determines Lending Principles; Limited to Legitimate Needs of Companies and Firms; Amount of Loans Flexible Depending on Usage; Statistics on Deposits and Loans of Various Banks and Pawnshops in this City</h3>
<p>Member banks and pawnshops of the Silver and Money Industry Association will cautiously provide long-term credit loans under the principle of tightening. According to the person in charge of the silver and money industry: After joint decisions, banks and pawnshops will only provide credit loans to companies and firms. The amount should be carefully considered and the purpose limited. Loan applications from borrowers whose purpose is investigated and deemed to be conducive to hoarding and speculation will be rejected. Loan applications from companies and firms are limited to members of the respective industry association, who must hold a license issued by the competent authority. Borrowers must also explain that there is a genuine need, and must have a reliable guarantor and legally signed contracts. As for the term of credit loans, it should not exceed six months according to custom. Old loans that expire at the end of the quarter have been recovered, but some accommodation will be given to those with good credit. In addition, the Money Industry Association will hold a "Quarterly Inner Panel Meeting" at 3:00 PM today to publicly determine the inner panel exchange rate and discuss credit loans at the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>Total Deposits of 2.5 Billion Yuan</p>
<p>According to a recent survey by the financial sector, the total deposits of banks joining the Banking Association in this city have reached 1.9 billion yuan. Among them, the deposits of eleven banks, including Zhejiang Industrial, Continental, Salt Industry, Jincheng, China, Transportation, Zhongnan, and China Reclamation, account for a total of 700 to 800 million yuan. The total deposits of member pawnshops of the Money Industry Association are approximately 600 to 650 million yuan. The total of the two is 2.5 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Loans Outstanding of 2.1 Billion Yuan</p>
<p>Regarding loans, the total loans of various banks are 1.5 to 1.6 billion yuan, and the total loans of various pawnshops are 500 to 550 million yuan, totaling more than 2.1 billion yuan. Among the above-mentioned loans, fixed deposits account for 20% of the total, and current deposits account for 80% of the total. Before the Incident, fixed deposits accounted for 60% of the total, and current deposits accounted for only 40%.</p>
<h3>Authorities of the Two Concessions Thoroughly Investigate Hoarding of Dangerous Goods</h3>
<p>It has long been prohibited by the authorities to store large quantities of dangerous goods, such as alcohol, cotton yarn, paper, cigarettes, and various acids and oils. Now, because the prices of the above items have risen sharply and it is easy to make huge profits in an instant, the number of people hoarding them privately within the concessions is increasing day by day. The concession authorities believe that hoarding materials is already illegal, and hoarding dangerous goods has a significant impact on social security. Several recent fire cases are directly or indirectly related to this issue. Therefore, profiting from dangerous goods not only disrupts the market, but also endangers the lives and property of citizens, and should be strictly prohibited as soon as possible. It is reported that the concession authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation of the hoarding of dangerous goods. Once evidence is found, in addition to the confiscation of all the goods, the hoarding households will be subject to the most severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Rationing of Grain in the Eleven Districts of the City to be Combined with Broad Beans; Sales Began Yesterday in the Nanshi District; Two Sheng of Rice per Person</h3>
<p>Regarding the rationing of grain for the eleventh period in the urban area, the Municipal Food Bureau has allocated it according to the current population of each district, and is now ordering each public rice distribution office to pay the money and issue the rice. It is expected that it will be generally opened for distribution within the next week. Except for the Nanshi District, which started selling yesterday and is all japonica rice, the other districts are indica rice. The selling price has not changed, but the amount of grain rationed has been changed to two sheng per person, regardless of age, and miscellaneous grains will also be added. It is reported that broad beans will be distributed first.</p>
<h3>More Than 40,000 Loads of Garbage Piled Up in the Nanshi District</h3>
<p>The total amount of garbage piled up in the entire Nanshi District for the past four months has reached more than 100,000 kilograms. Now that epidemic prevention work is being carried out, clearing garbage is the top priority. The municipal government has ordered the Nanshi Health Office to report the capacity of garbage piled up in the entire district in order to clear it thoroughly. After receiving the order, the office has completed the entire survey. It is estimated that there are 38 urgent areas that need to be cleared, totaling more than 37,800 loads. There are about 5,200 loads in less important areas. The total statistics require more than 42,500 loads. Regarding the implementation of the cleanup, an estimate is currently being actively sought, and the monthly cost is quite high.</p>
<h3>Police Department Reiterates Previous Order; Cracking Down on Non-Standard Measuring Instruments</h3>
<p>The police departments of the two concessions have repeatedly sent personnel to thoroughly investigate companies and firms that use non-standard measuring instruments. Those found to have such incidents will be investigated and dealt with according to regulations, fined, and the measuring instruments used will be confiscated and turned over to the public. The authorities are aware that the use of non-standard measuring instruments by companies and businesses not only violates the law, but also hinders the authorities' various measures to suppress and stabilize prices and stabilize the market. Therefore, the previous order is reiterated, and in addition to continuing to send personnel to various jurisdictions, including small vegetable markets, companies, and businesses, to conduct strict investigations, detailed regulations have also been made on the measuring instruments used in various industries. If such incidents occur again in the future, anyone can report them directly to the nearest police station or patrol post for legal action.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Cigarette Speculators Apprehended in Zhaofeng Park; 40 People Fined 1,000 Yuan Each; 8 Ring Leaders Sent to Court for Prosecution</h3>
<p>The English-language Times reported that according to official sources, the Shanghai West area, in order to eliminate hoarding and illegal profiteering in the cigarette market, found several groups of Chinese engaged in speculation in Zhaofeng Park on April 17, and also apprehended 56 illegal wholesalers.</p>
<p>Originally Active in the French Concession</p>
<p>It is said that these speculators were originally engaged in illegal profiteering activities within the French Concession. However, due to the intervention of the French police, they resumed their activities in the French Park. As a result of the increase in black market prices of cigarettes, they were discovered and stopped by the French police department. These people then abandoned the French Concession as a black market site and instead operated in Zhaofeng Park in western Shanghai.</p>
<p>8 Ring Leaders Sent to Court</p>
<p>However, these merchants in western Shanghai were quickly discovered and arrested. It is reported that of the 56 Chinese arrested, 9 were released after investigation and found to be innocent, and 40 were fined 1,000 yuan each. At the same time, the remaining 8 people, because they were leaders, have been sent to the Nanshi Court for prosecution.</p>
<p>Black Market Broken Up for the Second Time</p>
<p>According to Shanghai West investigators, these speculators had been active in Zhaofeng Park for several weeks before being discovered, from 10:30 AM to 2:30 PM every day. It is also known that the arrest of Shanghai West cigarette black market merchants is the second time this has happened. The first time was last week, when retailers who resold price-controlled cigarettes on the black market were arrested.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Distribution: Third Batch Available for Pickup Today</h3>
<p>Following the unified cigarette allocation by the China Central Tobacco Distribution Association, the second batch, consisting of products from Japanese-owned China Tobacco Company and Chinese manufacturers like Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and Fuxin &amp; Great Eastern, was completely distributed from April 15th until yesterday. The third batch, consisting of products from the military-managed Central China Tobacco Company, can be picked up starting today upon presentation of the distribution notice and payment at designated distribution points and the Great Eastern Company. The quantities are divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D, reportedly valued at 10,000, 7,500, 5,000, and 2,500 yuan respectively. The association has stated that if any of the 300 wholesale dealers and over 5,000 retail dealers in Shanghai are found to be hoarding or refusing to sell allocated cigarettes, or engaging in black market activities, the association will not only dispatch inspectors to thoroughly investigate, but also encourages buyers to report such conduct at any time for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Banquets Held in the Nanshi Area Must Still Pay Tax; Those with Tax Receipts are Exempt</h3>
<p>Since the Nanshi Tax Collection Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau was ordered to take over the banquet tax collection in the entire Nanshi area, restaurants, kitchens, and catering services within the area have been following regulations and paying taxes accordingly. Banquets moved from the concession area to Nanshi are also required to pay the banquet tax according to regulations to ensure fairness. However, those who already possess banquet tax receipts from the Finance Bureau are exempt to avoid double taxation and alleviate the burden on businesses. Mr. Jiang Bingquan, the director of the Tax Collection Office, yesterday specifically instructed all tax collectors to strictly adhere to these procedures to maintain order and demonstrate impartiality.</p>

<h3>The Science of Victory (2)</h3>
<p>Automobile Alternative Fuel Device…Mr. Kichibei Miki…</p>
<p>The invention of automobile alternative fuel devices, especially charcoal gasification devices, has had a tremendous effect in today's gasoline shortage. Mr. Kichibei Miki (54 years old), former army engineer and current director of the Automobile Control Association, began research on automobile alternative fuels long ago, 25 years in the past, when the number of automobiles in the capital was still few. In this cradle age of automobiles, Mr. Miki, then an engineer at the Army Automobile School, considered that if Japan were ever isolated, all gasoline would have to be supplied to aircraft. Automobiles would have to use alternative fuels. So he started this research. It can truly be said that he had foresight. At first, he completed an alternative fuel device based on alcohol, and in 1919, it succeeded in a test drive between Setagaya Automobile School and Kumagaya. However, because this alcohol must rely on plant-based materials, it is always subject to considerable limitations each year, so he began further research into the use of materials with permanence. At that time, only England had a solid fuel device, so he traveled to Europe and America to study, and after much painstaking research, we were finally able to manufacture a unique solid alternative fuel device in our country.</p>
<p>At that time, gasoline was very abundant, and automobiles could be bought cheaply from abroad. At such a time, the engineer devoted himself to research on alternative fuels, and as a result, many people called it foolish worrying. Some even mocked him, saying that instead of researching alternative fuels, why not buy and store large quantities of gasoline from the private sector? But the engineer never gave up because of this, and continued to work hard without retort, so as to carry out his original intention. First, he invented the charcoal device, and then he invented the wood gasification device. In 1935, it was finally adopted by the government, thus laying the foundation for today's alternative fuel transformation. The engineer said:</p>
<p>"In terms of wood gasification devices, the most difficult thing to research was how to dispose of the tar from wood charcoal. At first, I prepared several buckets to try, but because I felt it was too boring, I let the charcoal burn halfway, and from here, I produced some combustible gas, and then I invented a special container. I have devoted almost half my life to the research of alternative fuel devices, but today, under the Greater East Asia War, seeing cars running on the streets using my invention, I always think in my heart: "It wasn't a waste of time."</p>
<p>Invention of plastic surgery after facial injuries... Army Surgeon General Tsutomu Saito...</p>
<p>As a result of the increased power of various weapons in modern warfare, the injuries to the human body are also becoming more brutal. Among them, there are indeed many cases of injuries to the face, resulting in extremely unsightly disfigurement. The suffering of these war-wounded is far greater than that of those wounded in other parts, because it causes great mental unpleasantness. At the same time, if it is thought that it is enough to simply cure the patient's face and send him back to his hometown with an unsightly scar, then this unsightly and ugly face will easily discourage the youth of the hometown, and thus will affect the morale of the Imperial Army. Now, ugly faces injured in war can be brought up as an important topic for research and discussion on how to find ways to cure them. However, the medical treatment of this aspect has always been backward in all countries. Army Surgeon General Tsutomu Saito (currently head of the Army Medical School) has spent many years of painstaking effort to help these war-wounded, and as a result, has invented plastic surgery to treat injured faces. In the past, medical methods never considered plastic surgery, leaving behind an extremely unsightly face, but now he can remodel the face to make it look good, which is truly a great honor for the Japanese military medical community. The Surgeon General was born in Shiga Prefecture, graduated from Kyoto University in 1921, and was sent by the government to study in Germany for two years after obtaining his degree. From 1930 to November of last year, he was always a teacher at the Army Medical School, concentrating on painstaking research in this area. After the outbreak of the China Incident, the number of such injured people suddenly increased, so he officially took up the scalpel to perform plastic surgery on injured faces. At the end of that year, the surgical method designed by the surgeon achieved initial success, and later he designed a variety of plastic surgery methods. To this day, he has performed plastic surgery on more than 350 severely wounded patients with facial injuries.</p>
<p>The ugly shape after facial injuries is caused by bullets with great destructive power, so after a deep and intense wound, it becomes an extremely deep scar. In order to fill the defective part, it is very difficult to transplant skin from other parts of the body. It is also difficult to succeed with the method of transplanting and cutting off skin. Therefore, it cannot be successful without using the blood circulation method (using the transplantation method) before transplantation. At the same time, facial plastic surgery is different from plastic surgery on other parts of the body, because the ear is the ear, and the nose is the nose. Each has its own special shape and position, and cannot be changed or altered at will. The difficulty lies in this. Saito has invented about 13 surgical methods for this point to this day. Whether it is individual local treatment and plastic surgery, or joint treatment and plastic surgery of various parts, now no matter how serious the injury is, no matter how ugly the face is, it can be treated into a good-looking appearance. Even patients who have suffered severe nerve trauma for the first time have been completely cured after surgery. Saito has superhuman courage and serves as an active industrial warrior in the rear.

<h3>Economic Circle: Commentary: The Exchange of Funds Between Urban and Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Urban finance and rural finance seem to be in a competitive position, but in fact there is a common need. Urban industry and commerce are developed, production and sales are circulated with abundant goods, guarantees are reliable, and they can afford higher interest rates, so the financing of funds is easier and the scope of use is also wide. However, the concentration of funds in urban areas, as far as the disadvantages are concerned, will lead to rampant speculation. At the same time, due to the flow of funds to urban areas, rural funds will feel exhausted, and rural areas will go bankrupt, and the people will be unable to live. The purchasing power of farmers is weak, and urban products are also unable to be sold, and rural raw materials have lost their patrons. As a result, urban and rural areas are embarrassed and create a widespread economic panic.</p>
<p>The financial turmoil and economic panic in Shanghai in 1934 originated from the bankruptcy of several villages, so it was felt that rescuing rural areas was a matter of urgency. Therefore, since 1934, we have begun to actively promote agricultural finance, but it is too late. The lessons of the past are the lessons of the future. Those who are now discussing wartime food administration countermeasures first advocate "increasing production in order to achieve abundant harvests and replenish storage," then we must actively pay attention to agricultural finance.</p>
<p>However, agricultural finance is relatively difficult to do. In addition to government advocacy, it also requires national protection and incentives, giving low-interest funds, guaranteeing the safety of loans, and improving farmers' knowledge and farming methods. The adjustment of the entire agricultural financial system and the establishment of a system organization are necessary strategies for handling agricultural finance. If the rural economy can be sound, then there is no need to worry about the sudden and rapid development of food production.</p>

<p>The Nature of the Joint Venture Cooperative</p>
<p>According to the head of the preparatory office, Lu Wenshao: This cooperative was ordered to prepare, and everything is in its infancy due to time constraints. However, the government is greatly concerned about the wartime rice and grain problem during this period of participation in the war. It hopes that all rice and grain merchants will express their combined efforts to support the government's promotion of national policy. Therefore, even though this cooperative is in a hurry, it should redouble its efforts and speed up its work in order to be established as soon as possible. However, the network nature of the rice and grain joint venture cooperative is completely different from other grain trade associations. The joint venture cooperative is organized according to special laws and is directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Food and other competent authorities for grain. Rice and grain merchants who do not join the joint venture cooperative shall not operate the business, and those without a government-approved business registration certificate or registration certificate cannot join the joint venture cooperative.</p>
<p>The Status of the Federation</p>
<p>It is found that in addition to the rice and grain industry, which has set up a rice and grain joint venture cooperative as a control agency, other categories such as miscellaneous grains, flour, edible oil, and sugar have recently been prompted by the Ministry of Food to organize industry federations in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The preparatory offices of each of the federations have now been established. The locations are: (1) Miscellaneous grains industry, 150 Avenue Edward VII. (2) Flour industry, 95 Renji Road. (3) Edible oil, 150 Avenue Edward VII. (4) Sugar, 23 Tongyun Street. Each of the industry federations has now separately notified the operators in each city and county of the three provinces to organize trade associations before the end of this month, and then participate in the industry federations to unify the organization.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Sun Zhongli is the head of the preparatory office for the flour industry federation. All flour manufacturers and operators of bran business in the three provinces and two cities should immediately follow the newly promulgated regulations to form a flour industry association, which should be established before the end of the month and join the federation. The Shanghai flour industry association is divided into two groups: flour manufacturing and bran. The registration offices for the former are located at Room 403, Zhongfu Building, and the latter are located at Room 110, Zhonghui Building. Those who operate flour manufacturing and bran business are limited to register at these places on the 26th.</p>
<p>Oil and Sugar</p>
<p>The preparatory organization of the oil industry federation is the same as that of miscellaneous grains and flour. However, the Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Association is also responsible for the preparation of the federation's preparatory office. Huang Jiangquan is the head of the preparatory office for the sugar federation, and the deputy heads are Shi Yuchun and Zhu Chunbo. The sugar industry trade associations in the following districts must be organized and established within the month to join the federation. The list of sugar industry trade associations in each place (Nanjing District) is represented by Nanjing City, (Shanghai District) is represented by Shanghai City, (Wuxi District) is represented by Wuxi, (Tongzhou District) is represented by Nantong, (Huzhou District) is represented by Wuxing, (Anqing District) is represented by Huaining, (Yangzhou District) is represented by Jiangdu, (Songjiang District) is represented by Songjiang, (Taizhou District) is represented by Taixian, (Hangzhou District) is represented by Hangxian, (Luhe District) is represented by Hefei, (Zhenjiang District) is represented by Zhenjiang, (Suzhou District) is represented by Wuxian, (Jiaxing District) is represented by Jiaxing, (Huaiyin District) is represented by Huaiyin, (Wuhu District) is represented by Wuhu, and (Northern Anhui District) is represented by Fengyang.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The miscellaneous grains industry federation was ordered to be organized, and Fu Qiangeng, the head of the preparatory office of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains Industry Trade Association, also serves as the head of the preparatory office. The miscellaneous grains industry trade associations in the three provinces and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai should follow the regulations to establish a miscellaneous grains industry association in April to participate in the federation. The federation will send special commissioners to negotiate in other important districts. As for the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains Industry Trade Association, it is now scheduled to be established within the month. All those who operate miscellaneous grains business in Shanghai should join, and all are limited to register at the association before the 27th.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Resale Soda and Beer Industry Trade Association recently issued a notice to its members, stating: The association has found that many members have returned empty bottles that are often greasy, obviously used for other purposes, and the bottle caps are also incomplete.

Therefore, it is specifically notified that if the above situation occurs in the future, the first offense will result in a one-time suspension of distribution, and the second offense will result in the immediate confiscation of the guarantee deposit and cancellation of membership. It is also stated that the association's income and expenses have been greatly affected by price increases.

<h3>Reader's Forum The Fundamental Solution to the Price Problem (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Wei</p>
<p>From the above, it seems that two general departments should be established in the government: the Ministry of Supervision of Material Production and the Ministry of Supervision of Material Distribution. The ministries would be divided into several important material production and distribution departments. Due to this nationalistic organization of production and consumption, the issue of personnel becomes a prerequisite. The government should promptly finalize the "Regulations for the Punishment of Bribery and Corruption by Wartime Civil Servants." Regardless of rank, any official who violates the regulations should be punished. Those who engage in hoarding and those who protect hoarders, whether officials, merchants, or ordinary citizens, should be subject to the most severe penalties. "How can one govern others if one cannot govern oneself?" Cultivating self-governance should be the sole key to a strong nation. As for the various "investigation teams" and "secret investigation teams" organized by the government, they should be directly controlled by the central government and can be divided into mobile, plainclothes, and semi-militarized units. They should be mainly staffed by educated young people, with the goal of national and ethnic training and the standard of cultivating basic integrity.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, the living conditions of law enforcement civil servants must also be considered. The current civil servant salaries are still based on the salary standards set in 1933, which, according to the current price index, are about eighty times higher than the pre-war average. Due to livelihood issues, civil servants have to seek "extra income" outside of their salaries: some hoard goods and engage in commerce on a large scale, while others accept bribes and engage in corruption on a smaller scale. Under these circumstances, how can politics get on the right track? The government should re-establish official salaries based on the price index and provide considerable subsidies for daily necessities. In Japan and Manchuria, officials have preferential special rations, which have been implemented for years and have achieved remarkable results. Our country has no way to support integrity among officials, and this is something we should urgently strive to catch up with. (The End)</p>

<h3>Translated Commentary The Current Task of Suppressing Prices</h3>
<p>Looking back at the price trends of the past twenty-odd days, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, gold, and daily necessities, food, etc., have gradually decreased, and the black market for unified public bonds has also plummeted. In terms of price policy, this is a gratifying phenomenon, and ordinary consumers can also slightly ease their brows.</p>
<p>The tendency for prices to gradually fall is generally due to the following reasons. One is the exposure of hoarding and speculation in Shanghai, and the financial sector has a tendency to self-restraint. The second is the gradual recovery of material circulation between Shanghai and various places. Due to these two interrelated relationships, prices have been suppressed. Exposing hoarding and speculation is like pouring a bucket of cold water on the speculative heat. The financial sector's self-restraint has tightened speculative funds. Speculators with insufficient strength first release their own goods, and general hoarders follow suit. Financial institutions actively recover loans, making speculative funds difficult to circulate and raising borrowing interest rates, so there is not much profit from hoarding. These are all noteworthy phenomena.</p>
<p>Looking at the state of material circulation, since March 15, when the economic control power was transferred to the National Government, although the new control mechanism cannot be said to be perfect, the movement of materials has become quite active. The transportation of cotton cloth, medicines, machinery, and equipment to the interior, and the transportation of miscellaneous grains and other items to Shanghai, are quite considerable in quantity. Although the active movement of materials cannot be seen as the reason for the decline in prices, after circulation can be normalized, prices can of course be expected to be suppressed. Due to the convergence of various conditions, prices have had a downward trend.</p>
<p>The exposure of speculative hoarding will continue in the future. The self-restraint of financial institutions, of course, is to recover unreasonable loans, limit new loans, etc., which will inevitably help to promote the tendency of lower prices. Needless to say, the measures to suppress prices are easier to take effect when prices are falling than when they are rising. During this period, the National Government must actively work to suppress prices, which is what the people eagerly hope for. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance of the National Government will continue to investigate financial institutions and eliminate their illegal businesses, which should be encouraged and welcomed. It can be seen that the National Government has a strong determination on the issue of hoarding. It is expected that the authorities of the National Government will severely punish general hoarding behavior, and speculators will increasingly lose their speculative opportunities. This is the only point that the people are eagerly awaiting.</p>
<p>In order to lower prices and complete the suppression of prices, we must proceed from three aspects: cracking down on speculative hoarding, cleaning up the financial sector, and unblocking material circulation. Revitalizing production is, of course, a fundamental problem, but under urgent conditions, we must first implement the above-mentioned symptomatic treatment. Only with this comprehensive method can we suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. Repetitive emphasis is placed on the effective measures that must be implemented for prices now. And now is the right time to implement them. For the sake of economic recovery and the stability of people's livelihoods, there is no limit to what we expect from the National Government authorities.

<h3>How to Create Good Works</h3>
<p>— Tan Zi'an</p>
<p>The National Government has returned to the capital for three years. On the path of peaceful nation-building, political, economic, cultural, and other sectors are all advancing their respective work in parallel. However, in the cultural sector, good literary and artistic creations are still nowhere to be seen. This is a fact that no one can deny.</p>
<p>Last time, when the Japanese cultural envoy Tetsutaro Kawakami came to Shanghai, he said to a friend: The literary world in Tokyo is eager to see Chinese literary works, and if there are good works, they hope to introduce them as much as possible. This friend talked about this matter with several other friends in the cultural world, and as a result, they could not find any suitable works to introduce to the Japanese literary world. Although I do not think that works that can be introduced to the Japanese literary world are necessarily good works in China (because the situation of the Japanese literary world and its current stage are completely different from the current stage of Chinese literature, so the works that Tokyo likes are not necessarily good works in China. The works that China considers good are not necessarily liked or published in Tokyo), but from the domestic perspective alone, the situation is the same!</p>
<p>So, what is the reason for this? I think... literary writers, literary journal editors, and literary critics all have responsibilities, especially writers and editors have the greatest responsibilities.</p>
<p>So-called good creations are of course works that are contemporary, combative, and constructive. However, completing such works inevitably involves portraying the current situation of politics, economics, society, etc. Therefore, many writers and editors think it is dangerous and impossible. So writers dare not write, and editors dare not publish. This is the biggest reason why good works cannot be produced.</p>
<p>In fact, is it possible to describe reality? My view is this: the present is in the process of peaceful nation-building, in other words, peaceful nation-building is still unsuccessful, that is, everything has not yet been on the right track. Therefore, the dark sides in politics, economics, society, etc., are particularly numerous. However, these dark sides must be eliminated and cleaned up in the process of peaceful nation-building, and they cannot be allowed to exist. Of course, in addition to expecting the government to do this work, the people should also rise up to cooperate and promote it. The work of peaceful nation-building cannot be done by the government alone. The cooperation and promotion of the people has the greatest decisive power. Then, literary and artistic works that describe reality based on this understanding and attitude will never be opposed by the government, and there is no reason for opposition. I believe that our government is definitely not that dark.</p>
<p>Of course, I also admit that there are many things that cannot be revealed from the perspective of the overall situation because they involve various other things. However, this kind of problem is very rare in the literary and artistic creation sector. Moreover, the unique euphemistic style of literary and artistic creation can also overcome this kind of difficulty. At the same time, it is a special skill that other departments cannot achieve, but only literary and artistic creation can achieve.</p>
<p>Also, some people say that Japan's side must also be considered. That's right, Japan is now doing its best to help our nation-building work. Therefore, many places in the description of reality will also involve Japan's various aspects. Especially everything caused by Japan's attitude towards Chinese people is most likely to be mentioned in literary and artistic creation. But I also think that there is no problem with these. Because Japan's help to our country is sincere. China understands and welcomes it. Therefore, standing on the spirit of mutual assistance, if China criticizes Japan, it is definitely not so-called anti-Japanese or something. Moreover, Japan is absolutely aboveboard about this matter. In addition to Chief of Staff Kawabe's letter to Japanese soldiers, recently, there have often been remarks from the Japanese side admitting the crimes of their own residents. This is a fact that can be fully proven.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the creation of reality is entirely possible. As long as the author is well-intentioned and absolutely supports peaceful nation-building.</p>
<p>Secondly, the editors of literary journals also need to recognize the above-mentioned objective situation and give them the opportunity to publish. Otherwise, even if there are good works, they will not be able to meet the world, and the creation world will inevitably decline day by day. I dare not believe that there are no good writers in the past few years when good works have not been produced. There must be writers, but it is because there is no opportunity to publish. If I am not mistaken in my thinking, then the decline of the creation world in recent years is largely the responsibility of the editors of literary journals.</p>
<p>There is also the responsibility of literary critics. Although the scope of activity of critics is naturally limited before works worth criticizing appear. However, critics should be more sensitive than anyone else to grasping the objective situation and judging the stage. Being able to publish comments from time to time to encourage writers is also a condition for helping to produce good works.</p>
<p>Recently, a friend said such a sentence, he said that in today's literary world, critics have become writers, and writers have become poets. This sentence is very interesting and worthy of chanting. Because writers are afraid of reality and dare not create, so they use abstract expression methods to write poems. And critics have no object to criticize—works—so they start creating themselves. This phenomenon is not good in any case, it is of no benefit and will not produce good works. Because poets, writers, and critics, unless they are geniuses, must never be done by one person.</p>
<p>Based on the above arguments, writers, editors, and critics must recognize the objective situation at this stage, and standing on this understanding, put down their courage to work hard, so that they can produce good works. Only then can they shoulder the great task of building a new Chinese literature.</p>
<h3>Memories Brought by the Spring Breeze</h3>
<p>— Mu Fei</p>
<p>Spring Breeze,</p>
<p>Brings back memories:</p>
<p>A year ago when the peach blossoms were red and the willows were green,</p>
<p>A group of young people,</p>
<p>Along the rivers and mountains,</p>
<p>From distant cities,</p>
<p>Enduring the hardships of wind and dust and separation</p>
<p>Relying on a burning heart,</p>
<p>Towards, towards…</p>
<p>Finally,</p>
<p>The crystallization of blood and tears,</p>
<p>A quiet night,</p>
<p>We completed the arduous journey.</p>
<p>Before and after,</p>
<p>We were greeted and received by people,</p>
<p>The high-pitched singing in the celebration,</p>
<p>The crazy revelry at the reception,</p>
<p>Took away our depression.</p>
<p>Prospects,</p>
<p>Plans,</p>
<p>New life,</p>
<p>We are planning and looking forward to.</p>
<p>One day,</p>
<p>Two days,</p>
<p>It's the season of yellow plum rain again.</p>
<p>Everyone has forgotten us,</p>
<p>We are despised by everyone;</p>
<p>Our destination,</p>
<p>Only to win with the "wooden tablet" on the dilapidated ancestral hall,</p>
<p>Make our dreams of hope.</p>
<p>Cry,</p>
<p>Howl,</p>
<p>But people only repaid with ridicule.</p>
<p>Disappointment,</p>
<p>Disappointment,</p>
<p>Millions of disappointments,</p>
<p>Caressing the wounded heart,</p>
<p>Finally,</p>
<p>The road is opened up for us again.</p>
<p>Spring Breeze,</p>
<p>Brings back memories:</p>
<p>Let me bless</p>
<p>All those who are despised by people,</p>
<p>All those who are deceived by people.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— Zong Wen</p>
<p>Whenever doing something, one must understand the truth of the matter, and must not grope in the dark. The Bible says: "The truth can set people free," so we must grasp the truth and work hard. Then, individuals can succeed and difficulties can be solved.</p>
<p>When we encounter frustrating things, we must never be discouraged. We must still perk up and carefully examine the root causes of previous failures in order to come up with another good plan. The ancients said: "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, you suspect there is no road, but willows are dark and flowers are bright in another village." If you don't change your ways and don't perk up, you won't see the willows dark and the flowers bright.</p>
<h3>The Destroyed Life</h3>
<p>— Shi Ting</p>
<p>Uncle, add a little more,</p>
<p>There are still two noodles scorched at the bottom of the pot;</p>
<p>Since I ate some corn in the morning,</p>
<p>I haven't eaten anything since!</p>
<p>Also, thank you,</p>
<p>For bringing it over to me,</p>
<p>Don't knock the pot too much!</p>
<p>My arms are already numb,</p>
<p>My head has been swelling all the time,</p>
<p>I'm a little dizzy!</p>
<p>Look, this rice bag is stronger than me, heavier than me!</p>
<p>How can my weak arms</p>
<p>Carry it;</p>
<p>All the way here,</p>
<p>Walk ten steps, rest three times,</p>
<p>But my feet are still swollen!</p>
<p>The previous two days,</p>
<p>I had to borrow a hundred yuan from the usurer;</p>
<p>He said to me:</p>
<p>Suffer a little,</p>
<p>Carry a few more *dou* of Du rice.</p>
<p>After paying the money back to people,</p>
<p>You can sit at home, take a break,</p>
<p>Eat a few meals of thin corn.</p>
<p>But ah! Carrying one trip,</p>
<p>You can't earn five or six yuan,</p>
<p>This hundred yuan of new banknotes,</p>
<p>You think, how many times do you have to run back and forth!</p>
<p>My little life,</p>
<p>Will be handed over to the little devil sent by the King of Hell sooner or later!</p>
<h3>Anesthetic</h3>
<p>— Li Hanlian</p>
<p>In illness,</p>
<p>Except for the throbbing headache,</p>
<p>All the senses are numb.</p>
<p>The anesthetic makes my headache lose its sensation;</p>
<p>Then,</p>
<p>Everything is even more numb.</p>
<p>But people say I'm better;</p>
<p>Then; I fell into the abyss of bewilderment,</p>
<p>Never to have a sober day again.</p>
<h3>Self-Reflection</h3>
<p>— Zhou Su</p>
<p>Recently, I watched three Japanese films in a row at the Dahua Theater: "New Happiness," "New Snow," and "Theater Fun History." I feel that I want to say a few words in my heart.</p>
<p>It's not: "Increase the ambition of others, destroy your own prestige." It's just frankly and frankly telling the truth: I think the level of Japanese films is much higher than that of domestic films.</p>
<p>In the many domestic films currently showing in Shanghai, it is really difficult to find a film that can satisfy people. The full house sign often hangs high at the entrance of the Da Guangming Theater, which does not mean that the films being shown are excellent and meaningful. It is just like "Autumn Begonia" was performed at the Carlton Theater for more than 100 days, and every performance was full, but it is still not enough to show that "Autumn Begonia" is "successful." However, the three Japanese films I have seen can all satisfy people (especially the film "New Snow"). I think: filmmakers should not only think about "business eyes," but also go to see other people's works, humbly learn from others, take the strengths of others, and strive for their own improvement.</p>
<p>In fact, before January 9—before British and American films were banned from being shown—a large number of viewers were "fans" of British and American films and were unwilling to watch domestic films once. This cannot be blamed solely on the audience's lack of love for domestic products. Those engaged in the production of domestic films should also reflect on why there is such a phenomenon. After January 9, those engaged in the production of domestic films should take this opportunity to strive for revitalization and strive for improvement to wipe out the "humiliation" of the past—if they are willing to admit that the phenomenon is a humiliation. However, until now, nearly three months have passed, and we have only seen a rapid increase in production capacity, but we have not seen much improvement in quality, which is very sad for those who care!</p>
<p>In the film "New Happiness," although there are also romantic interludes, they are not excessively exaggerated, and there is no "disgusting as interesting." It just increases the interest, and the theme of the whole film is still very obvious, and the subject matter is very meaningful. This is worthy of praise and worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>The film "New Snow" expresses the educational spirit of Japanese national schools completely and the performance is very unique and very vivid. This kind of powerful work has never been seen in domestic films.</p>
<p>The film "Theater Fun History" vividly presents the Japanese dance art and the situation of the theater to the audience. The plot is very funny and meaningful, and there is no "low taste" existence. This is another thing that domestic song and dance films cannot match!</p>
<p>In the newsreel, I also saw the "Great Tokyo Special" by "Shochiku Cinema Co., Ltd.", which is fascinating and sighing. This kind of profound and moving short film that promotes the culture of the country is also rarely seen in domestic films.</p>
<p>The many words above, some people may feel that the criticism of domestic films is too harsh and inappropriate; however, I originally wrote this article with the attitude of "Chunqiu blames the worthy," and what I said is what many people who have the same opinions as me want to say. We don't like to watch domestic films; however, we are not born to dislike watching domestic films. On the contrary, we love domestic films very much, so we have greater expectations for domestic films!</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Lu Xun said a sentence, the general meaning is: "We don't have to hide our diseases, hiding is useless, the best way is to cure the disease."——Therefore, I have talked about these words that may have the suspicion of "destroying our own prestige", I sincerely hope that domestic films will "not be happy too soon"!</p>
<h3>Older Brother</h3>
<p>— Tian Ye</p>
<p>Older brother is coming home — it's Sunday.</p>
<p>Like every Sunday, his thin, long shadow quietly appears at the doorway, his blue cloth shirt and trousers stained with patches of machine oil, enveloping his bamboo-pole-like body, under his disheveled hair is still that pale, bloodless face, that face still wearing a forced bitter smile:</p>
<p>"Mom!"</p>
<p>A trace of a smile also appears on Mom's haggard face, but Mom's old heart is sobbing and weeping! — Older brother has become much thinner again!</p>
<p>Isn't that so? When older brother first entered the factory, wasn't he a strong and youthful man? However, ever since the day he entered the factory, every time older brother came home, Mom secretly sighed afterward; his rosy face gradually turned pale, his sturdy body gradually thinned down, thinner and thinner...</p>
<p>People who saw him all concluded that he was at least forty years old or so, but older brother is only twenty-four!</p>
<p>As soon as he entered the door, a mouthful of blood appeared on the ground.</p>
<p>Older brother sat down weakly, staring blankly at the ground.</p>
<p>"Older brother! You should go see a doctor!" we said, looking at him.</p>
<p>Older brother silently shook his head.</p>
<p>"Child!" Mom said gloomily, "Don't go tomorrow! Rest at home for a few days!"</p>
<p>Older brother silently shook his head.</p>
<p>"Can't you stop for a few days?" Mom said desperately: "If this goes on, your body..."</p>
<p>Silence. — Only older brother's rapid breathing.</p>
<p>"How can that be?" Older brother finally opened his mouth; "Mom! There's no need!... I just need to sleep well!... It's...it's okay!..."</p>
<p>Coughing, he stood up from the short stool, and from his blue cloth short shirt, he took out two ten-dollar bills and three five-dollar bills:</p>
<p>"Younger brother! Keep this to buy household...household rice! If...if there's any...left over...first...first pay back...pay back Aunt Chen next door...a few...dollars!...Buy...buy a small...small yellow croaker...for Mom...!"</p>
<p>After buying the household rice, I wanted to find a doctor for older brother, but as soon as I saw the banknotes in my hand, I stopped in front of the doctor's clinic. After hesitating for a while, I finally carried the rice bag back. — I didn't buy the small yellow croaker.</p>
<p>I went to Aunt Chen's next door.</p>
<p>"Child! You have to tell your older brother, when he gets his wages, to pay back a little more, everyone..."</p>
<p>Her face always looks like someone in the family has died.</p>
<p>Coming back, as soon as I entered the door, older brother's groans floated in the dim house.</p>
<p>I lit the oil lamp, and the pale yellow light shone on older brother's bloodless face and long, thin body lying on the bed. I suddenly panicked and trembled. Is this older brother? Is this a person? — A living, fleshy person?</p>
<p>I don't dare to take a deep sniff with my nose, because this...this many blood clots...Oh!...</p>
<p>There is no moon, no stars, just a pitch-black expanse.</p>
<p>But when the dawn barely breaks, older brother has to leave again.</p>
<h3>Under the Dim Yellow Light —Mourning Hua'er—</h3>
<p>— Yun Yan</p>
<p>Under the dim yellow light,</p>
<p>I unfold the letter bringing the news of your death.</p>
<p>I read silently,</p>
<p>Each word, each sentence, clutching at my heartstrings;</p>
<p>My eyes are blurred,</p>
<p>The past surges up in my mind.</p>
<p>It was the chrysanthemum season the year before last,</p>
<p>Our family was suffering from economic hardship,</p>
<p>Living on sweet potatoes and corn,</p>
<p>Causing you indigestion and unbearable stomach pains;</p>
<p>You raised your sorrowful face:</p>
<p>"Mom! When can we eat white rice?"</p>
<p>Your mom said with tears in her eyes:</p>
<p>"When your dad earns more money!"</p>
<p>From then on, you were afraid of making Mom sad, so you didn't mention it anymore.</p>
<p>We struggled through the year with difficulty,</p>
<p>Your illness worsened with the passing of time,</p>
<p>You were in bed nine out of ten days,</p>
<p>The doctor was helpless,</p>
<p>Our whole family was anxious for you!</p>
<p>We managed to get some rationed rice,</p>
<p>But you repeatedly shook your head:</p>
<p>"Mom, I can't swallow it!"</p>
<p>Not long ago, when your older brother came to Shanghai to study,</p>
<p>You begged to be taken along;</p>
<p>Your older brother comforted you in every way:</p>
<p>"I'll take you with me when you get better!"</p>
<p>You didn't answer, just sobbed.</p>
<p>When I heard this news,</p>
<p>I wished I could go home immediately,</p>
<p>However, I don't have those conditions — money, time.</p>
<p>I had to harden my heart and wish you a speedy recovery from afar!</p>
<p>Who knew you couldn't withstand the suffering,</p>
<p>And so hastily ended your life that had just begun!</p>
<p>Under the dim yellow light,</p>
<p>I hold the letter bringing the news of your death,</p>
<p>Raise my head and sigh,</p>
<p>Standing woodenly, speechless:</p>
<p>"Heaven and earth will end, but this grief will be endless!"</p>
