<p>社評</p>
<h3>中心思想</h3>
<p>思想本身無形無聲，收之可藏於方寸之中，放之則彌六合而發生雄偉之力量。就個人而言，氣宇態度之軒昂與萎頓莫不受想想之支配，性情行為之為聖賢盜跖亦莫不由思想之推動。國家民族原為由個人集合而成之有機體，人心之不同固各如面，然必有若干思想為多數人所共有者，是為國家民族之思想，其中佔絕對大多數者乃國家民族之中心思想。中心思想之力量，足以確立國家民族之立場，堅定國家民族之意向，有非武力所能轉移，更非在短時期中所能更易者。</p>
<p>「中心」名詞之意義，多適用於形學及平面，而「重心」名詞之詮釋則確切於力學及物體。知物體重心之所在，方知所以使其平衡之道，否則必遭顚撲無疑。國家民族之成分為個人，猶物體成分之為質點，控制物體必先探求其重心，把握國家民族則必先培養其中心思想。是以國家民族之中心思想，可視為國家民族之重心。</p>
<p>物體之重心愈高，則愈易改易其位置而使物體傾覆，愈低則愈能保守其位置而使物體穩固，此乃天然之法則，適用於物體亦適用於一切的一切。故中心思想愈向下唇滲透，則其發揮之力量愈大，而國家民族之立塲與意向愈穩定而堅決。物體之重心無善惡之分，而中心思想則可正確亦可乖謬。正確之中心思想愈限於上層階級，則其收效愈徵，乖謬之中心思想愈深入民間，則其危險性愈大。</p>
<p>中日兩大民族共存於亞洲，理宜相親愛而提携，奈以近百年來因種種事實上之激刺，使彼此之情感日益仇恨與蔑視，再加以外界之挑撥離間，背道而馳，寖假而形成牢不可拔之乘謬中心思想。兩國縱有先知先覺之人士，奔走呼號以圖轉圖於前，更有孫中山先生創導大東亞主義，昭示吾人於後，然而仍有此次中日事變之發生，斯誰之過歟？曰，乖謬之中心思想有以致之！</p>
<p>今國府還都，以恢復和平為職志，樽俎折衝，惟實現中山先生遺志是求。同時日本賢明之政治領袖以道義為懷，由中日基本條約而推行對華新政策，繼之以交還租界撤消治外法權，近復廢除已往一切不平等條約而訂立中日互惠互尊之盟約。是以兩大民族間之稱謂由仇寇而改為友邦以示友好之意，今則互稱盟邦，必更有盟兄盟弟之情。彼此間多年之障翳一掃而空，彼此間之猜疑忌刻當然不復存在。兩國當局以肝胆相見腑肺相交，為中日外交史創一新紀元，為大東亞前途闢一新途徑，吾人實所懽忻舞蹈者。</p>
<p>自今以往，乖謬之中心思想似已剷除，正確之中心思想尚須努力建設，由上而下務使之深入最下下唇。對於此項滲透之工作，標語口號之效力至微，惟婦人孺子親歷身受之事實，足以收圓滿之結果。庶幾已得之收獲，結晶而為國家民族之重心，並盼共陸績下移，俾整個國家民族之集團，不能為任何外力所能推欹。然後邁步前進，以達全面和平，復興中華，保衛果亞之三大目的。</p>

<p>通過總决議文</p>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　第二屆全國宣傳會議通過總決議原文如下：「思想鬥爭重在宜傳，建國基礎端賴文化。溯自和運屆開，我第四戰綫工作同志，在最高領袖指導么下。本　明堅毅之精神，為肅立思想而奮門，不避犧牲勉為前驅，以本位之努力，謀和平之拓展，統一之實現。政府還割翌年，首屆全國宣傳會議召開於首都，自是以後，內外形勢，變化萬端，由中日基本關係條約之簽訂，奠定和平之牢固基礎，繼之大東亞戰爭爆發，撞起東亞自由解放之警鐘。本年國府參戰，更完成獨立自主之夙頤。最近中日改訂條約，以道義之精神，締正義之同盟，更聯合東亞各國發佈大東亞共同宣言，正實現我國父遺志，踏上東亞共榮坦途，千一時之良好時會。環顧國內，雖尚有執迷不悟之人，阻撓和平，障碍統一，猶以為未足，更犧牲同胞，摧殘緬甸印度獨立之萌芽。言之痛心。然大擊所趨，英美侵略主義者之末日已至，中國獨立自主之完成，東亞共存共榮之實現，決非任何勢力所能過止之者。吾人於此，惟有貫澈初衷，益自奮勵。本年最高國防會議通過戰時文化宣傅政策基本綱要，矯正思想，已有最高準則，本屆全國宣傳會議，以確立戰時文化宣傳體制。動員文化宣傳總力，促進統一完遂戰爭為其最大深題。適在簽訂巾·日盟約，發表大東亞宣言之後，其使命之重大，自毋待言。本大會檢討過去，勝切來茲，誓本最高領袖所訓示，不避艱險，不畏危難，即吾人槍準，精誠團結，努力奮門，雖效死疆塲，亦所弗辭，謹遵戰時文化宜傳政筆基本綱要，及大會議決，强化各部門工作，籌設新聞出版協會，文學著述筑，完成戰時文化宜傳體制。內以　起民衆，掃蕩和平障碍，完成統一建設。外以激發國民戰門情緒，隨盟邦之後，援助頃印，聲滅英美，以爭取大東亞戰爭勝之利，而謀東亞民族之解放，謹此決議。」</p>

<h3>滿農地開墾計劃日決予全面協助　明年實施預定兩年內定完成</h3>
<p>東京廿二日中央社電　滿洲國於此次戰爭中，不僅以各種資材協力日本，且於食糧及其他方面亦直接間接對日本貢獻良多。日東條首相曁朝野上下對此深表謝意，因而日滿不可分之關係亦益趨鞏固。滿洲國乃負有食糧基地之使命，目前情勢亦因其任務益形加重。滿洲國鑒於此種情勢，乃樹立開墾廣大農地之新緊急計劃，同時幷計劃提前實施既存之農地開墾計劃，合此兩計劃案而草就一緊急農地開墾計劃案，此案業於日前提交日本政府請予協力俾謀實現。日政府乃以大東亞省為中心，對該案從事檢討結果，綜合各方面之意見，乃決定承諾該提案。日本方面協力該案之基本方針亦巳擬就，幷於廿二日之定例閣議予以通過。關於協力援助案之敵旨，業經日情報局發表，同時日靑木大東亞相發表談話，閘明該實行計劃之綱要，茲分誌如後：</p>
<p>日情報局廿二日發表：滿洲國鑒於現悄勢下所負食糧基地使命愈形加重，故乃進而提出緊急農地開墾計劃案，帝國政府方面遂亦欣然承受，且於本日之閣議中通過。關於協力援助該案之議案，蓋即根據此案對於實施該項計劃之資材資金技術等，由日方予以全面之協力與援助，俾使共同為强化食糧自給態勢而邁進。</p>
<h3>積極食糧增產對日重大貢獻</h3>
<p>青木大東亞栩發表談話稱，滿洲國　野現正盡全力增產食糧，並謀對日實行供給，實令吾人衷心感謝。今鑒於食糧之需給關係，滿洲國所負食糧基地之使命已益增其重大性，吾人甚期待今後滿洲國積極增產食糧。滿洲國政府為急速適應此種要求，乃澈底加强過去一切施策，並樹立劃期之農地開墾計劃，更為實現該計劃前，曾派武部總務長官來東京，對我國提出該案。我政府即根據該案，與關係事務當局加以檢討意見一致後，於本日閣議中通過，決定協力援助該計劃之基本方針。此次之緊急農地開墾計劃，定明年着手實施，至昭和二十年完成，僅以二年之短時期，於第二松花江地區及東遼河地區開闢新水田，提前實施既定之開墾計劃。一俟完成，即以其所產食糧供給我國，貢獻於我食糧需給關係之調整。自帝國政府而言，為完成該計劃，決於資金資材技術等各方面積極參劃協力，今後推行該事業，必將遭遇幾多困難，故切望日滿兩國愈益緊密提携，兩國關係方面更應眞擎協力深切理解。實施該計劃後，日滿食糧之自給態勢將更見强化，此於戰爭下洵堪同慶，於茲　對滿洲國之好意，表示甚深之謝意。</p>
<h3>澧水日軍　完成包圍戰略　繼續追擊向某方猛進</h3>

<h3>宣傳會議席上　松島部長演詞</h3>
<p>（續昨）五日的傍晚，我方海軍航空部隊在玻根維爾島南方海面，發現了敵方以航空母艦二隻，巡洋艦四隻，驅逐艦二隻，編成的機動部隊。於是僅僅用十八架的少數飛機，加以攻擊，轉眼間轟沉了大型航空母艦一隻，　沉了中型航空母艦一隻，大型巡洋艦二隻，巡洋艦或大型驅逐艦二隻，結果敵方差不多都被我們給擊　了。可是我們的損害，不過是三架飛機而巳。這一次的戰鬥，就叫做第一次玻根維爾島海面空戰。但是繼這一戰的後面，又有一個足以驚倒世界的大戰果，在南方海面登塲了</p>
<p>這實在可以說是第二次玻根維爾島海面空戰。從十一月八日的早晨起，我方的海軍航空部隊，對來襲的敵方輪送船團。及護衛艦隊，開始猛烈攻擊，結果獲得次於夏威夷海戰的大戰果，擊破戰艦四隻，轟沉巡洋艦二隻，大破大型巡洋艦三隻以上，擊沉驅逐艦三隻，巡洋艦或大型驅逐艦三隻起火大破，擊沉輸送船四隻，大型輸送船一隻，起火大破。擊落飛機十二架以上。這一次我方的損害僅僅是自　未　還的飛機，共計有十五架。</p>
<p>這一來敵方一舉就被擊滅了他的大輸送船團，和在所羅門方面行動中差不多在一個星期前，當玻根維爾島反擊戰開始的時候，麥克奥塞召集哈爾塞艦隊司令官哈門陸上部隊司令官，和克利特海兵隊司令官舉行作戰會議。當時拿着確有自信態度誇口的說：「一週以內就奪取玻根維爾島，然後設置戰爆聯合的航空基地。」但是這個話竟成為非常悲慘的結果：而出現了　眞是一個間接的諷刺。</p>
<p>對於第二次玻根維爾島海面空戰的戰果，天皇陛下曾經對聯合艦隊下賜優厚的　語，於是艦隊的士氣愈發衝天。在十一月十一日那天，晝夜不休的冒着險惡的天候，在玻根維爾島南方海面上，捉住敵方的機動部隊，加以攻擊。結果轟沉巡洋艦或大型驅逐艦各一隻，中破戰艦一隻，小破大型航空母艦二隻，大型巡洋艦一隻，大破起火大巡洋艦或大型驅逐艦三隻，及驅你艦一隻，大破起火擊墮飛機二架。我方的自爆和未歸還的飛機，合計也犧牲了三十架之多。想敵人也一定是必死的防戰吧。這是第三次玻根維爾島航空戰。</p>
<p>但是敵人仍不改前非，還來攻擊。於是十三日那天，第四次玻根維爾海面空戰又在那個島的南方海面展開了。結果轟沉大巡洋艦及巡洋艦各一隻，擊沉驅逐艦一隻，大破戰艦及中型空母各一隻。我方也失去兩架飛機。接着十七日的拂曉。又在同一戰塲展七了第五次航空虞，把敵方的機　部隊捕捉在我方海驚之兩翼下。轟沉他大型航空母艦一隻，擊沉他中型航空母艦二隻，巡洋艦三隻，及火型軍艦一隻（艦型不詳。）發揚了　人的戰果，但是我方僅僅失去五架飛機。</p>
<p>這樣的連戰數，還不改前非的敵人的固執，和他們對於玻根維爾島，及拉巴爾方面的作戰的熱度。我們由這一點就可以推測出來了，我們根據這個原因，把敵人牽制到這個海面上來，依次把他碎成海底下的藻屑。　種作戰的妙，眞是痛快極了</p>
<p>我想美軍所企圖的地方，就是在乎一面奪取我們在所羅門方面的基地，一面進佔新幾內亞北　，　面挾擊，而取俾斯　　　　　　　地方，　　頓在西南太平洋的步武。一舉衝破菲律賓，或我方的內南洋要點，使日本本土與重要物資的製產地分離，而對我方的戰力加以徹底的打擊。敵方為了要從這一方面挽同有利的戰局起覓，他的努力眞是　烈到極點了。眞是不借犧牲的為了要一舉而達成他的目的，在焦慮着，同時這種焦慮，正是在另一面表現着他們國內因為屢次一的敗戰，和人的資源鉅大的損失，演成一種非常困難的情勢呢。敵人愈焦急，而損害愈大，結果他們認為最得意的結果，便是我們最有準備的海鷺的戰果。</p>
<p>其次是敵方由緬甸方面的反抗，自從曼桔巴頓總指揮官的前後，就屢們海陸空也好像在進行着籌備。據五日華盛頓的電報說，曾經在重慶舉行三國軍事指導會議，關於今後的方針有所審議。但是這種會議，實在是敵人的常套手段，就好像從古以來兵家所說的「軍謹不戰」一樣，他們從早就呼號着雨季一過立刻大規模的開始，可是到現在還沒見他們的反抗作戰實現。</p>
<p>但是這一方面的航空作戰，倒是漸漸有激烈化的傾向。在過去的十月十日，曾經以一百數十架的飛機，大舉的來襲　光。並且九月以後，在這一由一千架增到一千六百架。主要是　全力攪亂我們的後方或補給綫，或是反覆盲炸無防禦的都市。除掉殺害無辜的良民以外，對我方的軍事方面，毫無損害。</p>
<p>在這一方面的作戰裏，我方的精銳陸軍航空部隊，總是在緬甸，法領印度，泰，馬來，這個　大的地域裏，擔當着常時不斷的防空，先發制人，擊滅敵人的空軍，或破碎敵方的企圖的任務。</p>
<p>至於敵方大規模的反抗，相信在敵方也是非信困難的。第一地方地形　雜，第二，補給困難。尤其最重大的問題，是毛色完全不同的。英美中三國軍隊統帥問題，在這一戰裏最值得注意的，就是陳誠率領重慶軍的立塲。</p>
<p>在過去的十日那天，重慶方面舉辦了第一次印度　這　丁的歡送咐，送出了身長一五八　，體重八四公斤以上的壯丁四百名，到印度去受訓練。為了這件事，曾經大事宣傳，像這樣，為了破壞大東亞永遠的平的建設，和　自已的國土國民永久　那　　之苦，而特別奔走到　　的印度去的壯丁們，心裏是應當做甚麼樣的感觸呢？</p>
<p>諸位都知道，印度是擁有四億以上的人口的，假若英美　要的話，對這一些民衆如以　　，或許多少還有點　　　。但是印度人的一大部分，都是受着無法援救的肌苦困難，可以說是餓殍累累，簡直因為英國的惡政，把一個佛教發祥地弄成苦惱的地獄了。一方面，印度的有心的民衆，對於江特拉鮑斯氏的印度臨時政府，所發出來的堂堂的宣言，雖然是衷心服從，但是在眼前的英美人的壓迫之下，就是心不從．而表面上也只好屈服。當這個時候，英美不使他自己的國民流一滴血，專以現地補給的立塲，用印度及重慶的民衆，在前面構成防爆幕，而自己竟在飽衣暖食的專面，一面吸烟吃酒，一面打算向著奪取中國的利权進軍，像那些重慶選那裏也都是智能體力極其優秀的人材，重慶方面把他們實行破墺建設大東亞的事情，我们眞是不知重庆的眞意的所在。尤其對於這一些　眞的靑年們的父母兄弟姊妹們，眞有禁不住的同情。</p>
<p>從古以來就說，「不起無名之師為中國之大義」，像這樣為了無名的戰爭，而使　　的靑年流血的不可思議，眞是用不着多說了。在印緬方面的隊先發制人的攻擊，被驅逐到怒江的東岸，他們所誇口的，和英美的協同　作，也瓦解了。　（以下轉入第四　）</p>
<h3>三品報道部長　在全宣會議演講詞　二大勝利與大東亞民族集團之運命</h3>
<p>中央社　日駐華派遣軍總司令部報道部三品部長，於第二屆全國宣傳會議席上演說，共要旨如次：</p>
<p>吾人於過去二十日中，在物心兩方有兩大勝利紀錄於歷史，其一為大東亞共同宣言之發表，另一為數次玻根維爾島海面航空戰之戰果。大東亞戰爭爆發以來，迄巳二年，大東亞十億民族於此大東亞偉大戰爭下，為掙脫英美桎桔，在亞洲之理想與意志上，而企求建設統一之理想，巳於大東亞共同宣言中顯現於世界。其內容之五大原則，實為明示全世界人類進至新的文明與和平之途徑。吾人明知以大東亞共同宣言，與英美陣營所發之無數欺騙譎詐之各種宣言聲明，同作對此，實無意義。但以大東亞之一員，應負大東亞建設責任與光榮之渝方，竟獻媚於英美虛偽空白之宣言，故意誹謗大東亞共同宣言，吾人對此事實，於亞洲的道義觀上，對渝方此種態度，實屬遺憾。</p>
<p>試觀共同宣言第一條，關於東亞共存共榮之原則，為「大東亞各國共同確保大東亞之安定，根據道義，建設共存共榮之秩序」。巾國國父孫中山先生亦曾謂「實現大亞細亞主義，必須以我國固有的文化為基礎，固有的文化即為道德，即為仁義」。此種共存共榮之原則，與中國國父孫中山先生之思想不謀而合，此嚴肅之事實，為任何人所不能否定者。</p>
<p>又第二條關於自主獨立親和之原則，為「大東亞各國互相尊重其自主獨立，求互助教睦之實，以確立大束亞之親和」。此在「中國之遝命」中所謂「亞洲民族之自由與國家之平等，為世界永遠和平之保證（中略）。民族自由及民族平等之原則，應適用於戰後之和平的國際組織。第一次世界大戰後所成立之國際聯盟，其所以失敗，主因即在於抹殺此原則，所謂r世界强國」或「勢力範圍」之觀念，及由此觀念而檔成之制度。在第二次大戰後之平等的國際組織中，應不再見。」此種切實希求民族之自由與平等，即為大東亞各國互尊獨立之總親和原則，而為不能掩飾者。</p>
<p>再第三條關於發掦東亞文化之原則，為「大柬亞各國互相尊重其傳統，發展各民族創造性，以闡掦大東亞文化。」其中互相尊重其傳統，闡揚文化之原則，作如何觀察，「中國之運命」中曾謂，r在世界文化上的民族國家之自由獨立，以文化的自由獨立為要素」，故主張民族文化之理想，砍求之於英美的民主主義文明乎，抑求之於東洋本然王這的治平之這乎。</p>
<p>其次，第四條關於　濟提携繁榮之原則，為「大東亞各國於互惠之下，緊密提携，圖發展共經濟，以增進大東亞之繁榮」。此為發展經濟與大東亞共榮之原則。</p>
<p>又第五條關於供獻世蜀進運之原則，為「大東亞各國以增進萬邦友誼，撤廢人種差別，普行溝通文化，進而開發資源，以期貫獻於世界之發展」。此為貢獻於世界發展之原則，以與英美所謂大西洋憲章中「各國獲得通商及世界資源之平等權」，「獲得自由世界」之原則對此，其理念與事實又如何</p>
<p>試想高築關稅壁壘，妨害壓迫日本之和平通商，且敢行經濟絕交者為何國，為獨佔西半球各國之殖民地資源，而橫施奸策者，又為何國。就撤廢人稱差別而觀，英美口唱自山，說和平，並稱保障一切民族之健全而和平的生活，但此楞　其對待黑人之酷烈參　的差別待遇。其對亞洲有色民族牢不可破之差別觀其蔑視觀，不待林語堂之警吿，即可明瞭．故砍望英美發善心，撤廢不平等條約，取消禁止中國人移民法，實為可憐之妄想。蓋彼等盎格魯撒克遜民族之功利主義的．世界觀，實為永不能除去之宿孽，其陰謀多端之譎詐外交，乃為週知之事實。而其再度支配亞洲，及制服中國之陰謀，則巳脫除舊套，而能用獨特之校滑的新手段，即「所編成美洲混合空軍，」而完全支配渝方空軍」又「以借款予渝方，而將其財政經濟作半殖民地之支配。」以此而與吾人大東亞共同宣言之根本理念，及誠實而果斷之建股與實踐，乃至如巴布亞民族亦參與政治等事實相對照，誠有天壤之別。</p>
<p>由此而觀大東亞共同宣言之為王道公明正大。且為韓換世界人類史之不滅的國際憲章，實為任何人之良心深處所不能不肯定者。茲再就數次來波根維爾島海面之航空戰戰果而言，實有要求全世界作準確觀察與判斷之權利。</p>
<p>吾人曾有警吿，反軸心軍之反攻，於到達某一綫前，遇我大東亞强　之防衛　，其反攻之規模如愈大愈熾烈，則必將遭達龐大之消耗與潰滅之悲劇，彼等所謂反攻緬甸，反攻太平洋，乃至大吹大播宣傳之東亞攻勢，實為吾人求之不得，圍滅敵人之絕好機會。英美自誇之莫大的戰力與物力，將在東亞遭如何之運命，彼等自身即將體騐，此亦巳有預告者。而數次來被根維爾島海面之航空戰，在美國方面實謂為共痛苦之體騐</p>
<p>除以擊沉擊毀其戰艦六艘，航空母艦八艘為最大外，至第五次航空戰止，敵方損失艦艇一百數十艘，飛機五百三十餘架，兵員消耗不下二萬餘，可請巳付出高價之犧牲。誠然英美之東亞反攻並不即此可認為巳受挫折，其無謀之反攻，或仍將依賴其唯一之「量」，而繼續展開。然日本大本營發表之戰果，足以證明者為何，即近代戰鬥之勝負，決非時之僥倖，乃由國家總力之集結決定。此戰果之發表，直接足以表現日本戰力與人力資源之優勢，並證明日本國內航空技術之勝利，景的生產之確立等，巳能適應敵方量的反攻，完成國內戰時體制。所謂日本戰力低下，國力將生破綻之觀察，實為不理解日本國體之神髓，及日本民族之生命力。依然執其偏見，斜視之觀察，誠可謂為不足與語大東亞民族維新復興之r思想性格的破產者。」故依　「與英美共同戰爭，」「　甸反攻，」「四國共同宣言」等而夢想抗戰之勝利，托於戰後之建設者，其愚誠可憐憫。一國之革命，唯有完整之自主獨立，國內民族之統一始可完成，此為古今不變之鎭則。值此人類史之現階段，處於此國家民族之生存環境，能予運命而無　者，即為洞悉古今之明見，與毫不　向之　　與信念。</p>
<p>以上所述，為東亞戰爭送上兩大共同勝利，足使大東亞各國家各民族，及領導之先覺者，於其將來之共同建設上，獲得戰爭全局之勝利。深信大東亞民族集團之運命，必能獲得勝利之光榮。</p>
<h3>齊托密爾德軍　東進六十里　蘇軍發動牽制攻勢</h3>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　海通社訉，蘇軍於昨日自南北兩面竭力進攻，企圖切斷　伯河套之德軍，德軍由飛機協助，擊潰蘇軍坦克車兩隊，及步兵八師至十師。蘇軍向尼柯波爾德軍　頭堡及克里伏洛格西北及北面進攻時，以坦克車隊向尼普貝特羅夫斯克西南推入進，蘇軍在廣關之前綫，僅於伐錫傑夫斯卡以東，突入德軍陣地，刻在　殲中。某輔以西，激烈爭奪齊托密軍至基輔之公路，大雨之後，該路幾難通行，蘇軍雖埋置地雷，德軍仍繼續進展，據軍藉工兵之努力，巳進抵齊托密爾以東約六十公里之處。普利伯河與聶伯河合流處之西南，雖天氣惡劣而仍有劇戰。柯洛斯頓區域尤為激烈。</p>
<p>森瑞與京城二十二日中央社電　東綫德軍反攻作戰，巳使基　四方頓戰局告好韓該處戰事仍甚熾烈。同時蘇軍在聶伯河套地區開始大攻勢，企圖從克里伏洛格，尼普貝特諾夫斯克及尼柯波爾三方面，一舉突破　軍陣地，但德軍當即猛烈還擊，遂展開拉裴戰擊毀，蘇軍戰車二百四十七輛，將蘇軍完全阻止。又柴普魯基區蘇軍正在聶伯河作渡河戰，刻正向西岸源源增援，蘇軍此舉其目的顯在牽制齊托密爾德軍之反攻作戰</p>

<h3>從培養技術人才談到學徒求學問題</h3>
<p>— 徐嘉鈴</p>
<p>在這培養技術人材聲中，我們曾經指出我們技術落後的原因，為一：上級技　人員不求長進，二，下級工人的故步自封，但是下級工人為什麼要固步自封呢？當然有很多的原因，但是資方的厭惡工人的求學，亦為主要原因之一，</p>
<p>當然，在白晝，因為要做工，是決不可能求學的，那末晚上呢，總該許工人自修或進夜校求學吧，可是廠方店方還是不喜歡，對於能自立的工人，行動較自由，無何影響．可是却苦了一班尙未滿師的學徒，和一班宿於店中的練習生，但是究竟為了什麼理由，廠方和店方要干涉學徒們的求學呢？</p>
<p>我們試將資方的理由歸納一下：</p>
<p>學徒晚上求學，　眠不足，必致日間沒精打彩，甚至於打瞌睡，影響工作效率。</p>
<p>學徒晚上念書，自修必多消　電費。</p>
<p>學徒十時後囘店，擾亂他人睡眠。</p>
<p>學徒時常外出，易於作弊。</p>
<p>學徒或兌利用讀書名義，任意外出，作不正當娛樂。</p>
<p>我們並不否認他們的理由，不過談我們想一想</p>
<p>晚上十時囘廠，自修一小時，明晨六時起身共計睡七小時離標準的障眠時間只差一小時，在體力强大的，常然可以極無影響，即使廠方認為非睡八小時不可，那未亦可　其同來後即睡，睡眠可不愁不足了，並且，由於學徒知識的增加，有利於事務的進行，工作的效率不是反增加了嗎？</p>
<p>對於電費，我想以一廠一店之大，對於區區一二小時一　電　的費用，總不致於斤斤較量吧，即使廠方認為非計算不可，那末只要　學徒囘來就睡，學徒亦可以早起自修，要不然令學徒按月貼還電費就得啦，不過天下那有這種店主呢？我想。</p>
<p>店主為了上項理由的太自私化，於是就拿整個宿舍的工友的安　琮做理由了，可是事實又是怎樣呢，工友間因為遭遇　不幸相同，彼此間有了深切的了解，所以感情是非常的好，們看覓同事在他自修，決無干涉之事（除非少許日心下流之妒忌者，）這是人類的一種天性——同情，况且做功課並不是胡鬧，一定要發很大的聲音，最明顯的是圖書館比旅館要安靜得多，即使店全還不放心，那未儘可令其囘來即睡。</p>
<p>至於作弊這是學徒的品性問題，店主在收學徒之前當然要看學徒的品性，誰願收　學徒呢。作弊即是犯罪，一個好好的自由人為什麼要犯罪呢？犯卯的是那一種人呢，難道是求上進的人願意犯罪嗎？况且學校是修養良好品件的地方呀！</p>
<p>對於學徒利用讀書名義以作不正當娛樂，這一點的可能性比較大一點學徒在廠裏說是在唸書，對校方說，廠中事忙，　　，於是在二方均安排好了以後，就大過共墮落生活。不過這1點不是不可避免的，只要廠方和校方有密切的連絡，校方可常派人往廠方訪問，同時廠方亦常向校方詢問，這樣非但使學生在校方與廠方之合作下，完成良好的品性與學業，同時促進學校和工商界直接的接觸和合作。</p>
<p>在我國，學徒的數目是相當的驚人，在這一羣可憐的同陶中，也許有許多被埋沒了的天才，我希望資方能竭力改去以往態度，並且獎勵自修和求學，使這一羣在泥土中的黃金，發掘出來，那末在不久的將來，中華民國的　術人材，將不愁其寡劣了</p>
<p>由於資方的獎勵求學，我想下級工人的故步自封一定能很快地消滅，同時因為下級人員技術的增進，因而逼使上級人員的更求上進，在層層的推進下，誰說我國沒有希望呢？</p>
<p>改良童工制度檢討</p>
<p>童工問題是各國經濟學者很注意的經濟問題，而在我國注意此問題者甚少。我一國童工制度，盛行於社會問，其流弊之多比世界各國為劇。在此戰時r生產第一」之下，童工的盛行直接是妨害生產，故我們有提出來檢討的必然性。</p>
<p>按童工起源很早，其主要原因為貧困所致。最初的童工只幫助家庭中做吿經便工作，一面學習，一面教導，由父母做伴，其害處較小。自工業革命後，童工均由家處　上社會，此輩未成年的勞工，頗為一般眼光較低之雇主所樂用。因為　童工無工會作後盾，既不會罷工罷工，又河壓迫　工資比成人低，以上二原因造成童工制度之極端發達。</p>
<p>童工的發達對於生產，兒童，社會，國家，…等都有害無益。其主要　端有五：　童工每天從事十數小時之單調工作，體力腦力均有損害。文盲佔十分之九，將來很容易犯罪及做不利於社會之行為。　童工增加，勞工起競爭，資本家利用此點减輕工資，使勞工生活更趨困苦，勞工不能滿足生活必需之　望，其工作效率必减少。　破壞兒童身心，因此發育不全，容易　生不良國民。　童工是「　　勞工」，而非「經濟勞工」。因童工往往技術欠佳，容易浪費以料和機器。　童工既失去學校敎育，又失去家庭敎育，致易造成道德低落，意志汕　，缺乏平等觀念等弊端。</p>
<p>我國因經濟上貧困的關係，完全取消童工的可能性極少，現在將改良童工主要之點提出，以備關心童工福利者之參考　由當局禁止十四歲以下之兒童做H，十四歲以上兒童之工作不得超越成人之一半。　身體衰弱或有疾病之兒童不得工作。　規定工作時問不得過六小時。　實行工廠檢査，如有違反法律規定之業主，應受嚴重處罰。　　　慈善敎育，廣關義務學校，使一般貧困兒童得享受敎育之權利。　設立兒童圖書館，及其他兒童福利事業，如貸學金，兒童義務醫院等。　由社會智識　子　傳童工制度之弱點，使資本家不致因貪小而叻害整個社會進　、並應令雇主與社會合作。</p>
<p>總之、童工制度的改良，是需要資本家方面自動提倡，否　　　多未來的主人　，將永遠受到慘人的摧殘！</p>
<h3>「樑上君子」提前獻演　「飄」最後三天</h3>
<p>苦幹劇團以其雄厚的實力，浩大的聲勢，在巴黎大戲院為本報讀者助學金作長期義演，第一砲「飄」（「亂世佳人」）巳獲得美滿的成績，決定於二十四日輟演，截止今日為止，祗剩最後三天了。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>「便交」問題</h3>
<p>華商證券交易所自奉財實兩部命令復業以來，我們對於證交的展望！雖未能盡所欲言，然巳言之屢矣。我們自始即曾說過：「在此社會經濟狀態動盪不定之際，人民心理，大半趨於投機：欲求證券交易，完全不為投機之對象，其勢或有所不能，惟有希望政府，對於監督方面，益求嚴密，如禁止期貨交易，如限制銀行以股票作押款，如徵收證券交易所稅，皆不失為防止過分投機之補救辦法。」</p>
<p>關於「禁止期貨交」一點，華商證券交易所開拍之初，固曾規定祗准現貨交易，絕對不得期貨買賣，換言之，即買進者以現款出貨，賣出者以股票取現，如經紀人有買空賣空投機行為，一經査出即依照規約予以制裁，其防範投機之初衷，固巳昭然若揭。如今，華商證券交易所為謀所謂交　便利起見，有開拍七日「便交」買賣之舉，此項辦法，為運用證券，使之靈活起見，或許未可厚非，但證券巿塲，最須防制避免者，即為買空賣空之投機交易。巳往實貨交易，尙多投機份子，興風作浪，今有七日之便交買賣，則一般做空頭交易者，難免利用此七日間之　挪時間，以復施其蠅營之奇技，致使證券市塲又復易於發生不安穩之波動狀態，此則不可不加以深切之注意。基於「防微杜漸」一句話，在此市塲易起波動的一個環境下，證交能不「大開方便之門」，實施「便交」新制，自為最妥，否則亦須在事前參考各國成法，詳訂規則，毋使做空頭交易者流，借此活動徒滋搖撼證券布塲的地位，那是未免得不償失了！</p>
<h3>證交「現貨便交」目前尙難實現　各界希望將行情公布</h3>
<p>關於前傳華商證券交易所擬自昨日（二十二）起「一星期交　」期貨一事，各方面對之，頗為注目。頃悉證交當局對於此事，雖名為「現貨便交」，而實際上等於做開一星期交割之期貨，如開拍時稍不謹愼，即易受投機者操縱，發生買空賣空現象，影饗整個股市匪淺，故在未試拍之前。不得不妥籌善法。是以昨日開始一說勢不可能。</p>
<p>市經濟局收回執</p>
<p>照關於取締華股塲外交易一事，記者調査所得知若干股票公司於證交開拍後，依然各自為政，做開塲外交易，實因此種股票公司，前曾領有經濟局發給之　舉執照，准其做開交易，證交復業後經紀人雖巳重行核定，然市經濟局之執照，並未收回，故凡持有執照者，仍可繼續其單獨營業。茲悉證交常局為達到取締塲外交易起見，向市經濟局數度接洽之結果，經濟局巳開始收回前發執照，因之塲外交易，日內即可消滅。</p>
<p>股票行情必須公佈</p>
<p>以關於股票行情之公佈問題，各方而對之亦極關切。蓋照目前情况，證交巿塲內做開之行情，因不能在報端公開發表，僅有少數可以入塲交易之經紀人，可以知之此中流弊所及，凡稍有商業常識者，自均明瞭，故證交當局及工商各界，均望有關當局對此問題，能重加考慮，早日開放，使買賣股票者均能在報端詳知各股價格使股票經紀人不能隨便操縱，此於股市之穩定及交易之入於正　，實有莫大利益。</p>
<h3>各行莊統一　抬頭支票</h3>

<h3>松島部長演詞（自第二版轉來）</h3>
<p>在這個中間，重慶是再三的對印度束部的英軍求救，可是仍然是保持着他們那冷然傍觀態度，而漸漸的在引起重慶軍極大的反感。就根據這一樣事，就可以判然的了解英美人的眞意了。他們只是在自巳合適的時候，利用東亞民族，一旦不利，那便置之不理，這是很明顯的事。不，他們就是在同志之問也是這樣。就像在鄧扣克敗戰的時候，英軍就是用荷蘭比利時的友軍做犧牲，自己趕緊逃囘本國，幷且將校以上的人，還因為退却的巧妙，全部受過恩賞哪。不，還有他們就是在同國的軍隊之問，海軍對陸軍或空軍，也是不斷的爭鬥的，這也是不能忘掉的事。重慶軍竟不顧巳往的歷史，和英美人的本性，一味的和他們協力，一味的掘自已　穴，眞是可憐極了。對緬甸方面的反抗，就是像以上所說的那樣有．多的難點存在若，陸上有我們的精銳陸軍部隊，在繼續着不敗的配備，同時在必要的時候，海軍的精銳又可以遮滿了海空，來擊滅來襲的部隊。所以他們的來襲，結局是催促英美自體早日壞滅，尤其是被置於最慘的運命上的，就是重慶軍這件事就更容易判斷了</p>
<p>當然根據戰局的推移，英美艦隊的一部分或在北非的軍隊的一部分。要往印度方面移動的。但是這絲毫不足為念，我們相信敵人對於地中海和大束亞的海，是各在一個完全不同的環堉裏，這件事不久就會明白了。就是英美軍在等於沒有海軍力的地中梅方面的策動，也許是非常容易，但是應該知道印緬甸方面的地形和我方海軍的存在，和他的情况是完全不同的。况且就像最近的玻根維辦島海面空聯那樣，我們只甩幾架海軍機，就可以很容易的把敵人的戰艦和航空母艦碎成海底的　層．像這樣看來，無論他來甚麽樣的艦議，反倒要為我們慶賀了</p>
<p>其次在新幾內亞方聞的我軍，從一部分基地轉進到戰略的要點以后，　敵軍到芬希哈罕地方，由北方加以攻擊．展開　烈的陸戰，同時和航空戰相呼應，在發展着赫　的戰果。我們認為敵人的企　，恐怕是想從新幾內亞的中部　舉衝破菲島方而。或我方在　　屬東印的重　資源生產地域，但是等到　人和我們一接近，他們的運命的是非，立刻說可以判定了。</p>
<p>班　海方面，雖然常常有敵機來　，但是他們每次都是得不到任何的戰果，還要　受多大的損害敗退的。</p>
<p>其次，是中國戰綫，最近美國在華的空軍（第十四航空隊）常常在掦子扛上流及華南方面出現，實行盲　或機關槍掃射，但是他們所給與中國無辜民衆的損害，要有我方軍事施設所受的損害幾十倍。這是屢次在報紙上報道過的，最近渝參政員張仲仁和冷　等曾　運絡蘇浙二省的有力者關於在華美空軍對中國民衆的舉行，對重慶提出過陳請書重慶方面有扣留過的事實。</p>
<p>據英政府五日的發表，最近任命惠亞特為駐軍慶特派軍事代表，邱吉爾及東南亞洲最高指揮官蒙特巴頓。不管他是任命誰，總而言之無故的胡中國的國土及民衆亂加暴壓的英美軍是不能允許他存在的。</p>
<p>下面再說一　英美的宣傳，英美的宣傳總是洗唐無稽，比起白髮三千丈式的重慶的宣傳，還要來的巧，這是諸位因為掌　這類的事情，所以知道得很淸　的。尤其他們對於最近太平洋方面的戰　為的要欺瞞自國的國民　見，眞是報道了許多値得驚寄的虛構事實，就是從把我方海軍在玻根維爾島航空戰收獲的　　戰　發表出來以后，學世都被我國海軍機的威力　　驚倒了。接到了這個報進以后，美國的海長諾克斯對着新聞記者說，這完全是虛　，但是事實上我方從十月二十七日的摩諾島海　以來，僅僅十四天的工夫，就樹立了由　　　艦航空母艦大型巡洋艦起一直到擊沉擊毀艦船七十七　以上擊　毀飛機五三零　架以上的記錄，而美國海軍仍舊援例作小量的發表，說在南太平洋喪失了　逐艦三艘。</p>
<p>像這種對於國民的欺瞞，究竟能繼續到什麽時候，很成疑問。在這一方面的戰　裏倒地的美軍，至少也不下一萬名，像這樣的話，簡直就沒有出頭的可能了。我們想到他們的家族的心裏，眞是萬分同情。</p>
<p>但是可以詳細表明他的事實的事件，就是在我們大本營發表以后，羅斯福大總統立刻召集聯合艦隊司令長官金格及參謀長馬歇爾的航空愉司令官亞諾爾到白宮，不知道為什麽事舉行了緊急的首腦協議，他們的動搖眞是難以遮蓋。美國朝野的人士，都在監視着這個不明白的白宮的秘密，等待着在光天白日下曝　出來，同時美國將校家族團，聽說也在大舉催促當局發表專實。</p>
<p>英美像這樣一面忍心的做着不信實的事，一而伸張自己的非望，畢竟他的眞意就是某於個人主義上的制　世界的思想。無論在他的任何地方，都　不到正義和人迸來，經過長時間用欺瞞和籠絡，獨占了世界上的富　繁榮的。他們眼看看就要被人家打破了他們的假面具，而　　在白日的下面了。把這個　破了，把這繼粉碎了，使著世界上能實行天地之公道，這才是眞實的建設大東亞的精神，這都是包括在这一次大東亞會議，對世界宣布出的五條大東亞共同宜言裏面的。這五個原則，無論從那個　點看起，都不是像門羅主義那樣利己的，獨占的，排他的，是在尊重自己的，同時更拿着家族化的親和，在大東亞建設王道樂土的。</p>
<p>而這個大精神，是由於日本從建國以來的誠意凝結，才在這個時代吿成，而其體化了，這是參加大東亞會議的各國代表所共認的一點，為了貫徹這個精神，才起了大東亞戰爭，長久的在英美的桎　下，不顧天賜的自由和獨立，從日蔭的路上渡過來的。我們所有的友邦，都能夠猛然的起來，為解放亞洲，為亞洲的獨立而戰爭，這是多麼崇高的戰爭啊，我們祖先的在天之靈，是欣慰的，上天看　我們，我們的子孫，又是把我們興衰的運命，寄　給現在的我們。而等待着戰爭的結果，戰爭成功的時候，在大東亞實現的，便是天花紛紛輝耀在三千大千世界的極樂淨土，戰敗的時候，所剩下的便是巳經死　了荒涼的東亞山河。</p>
<p>究竟是打算收服　迫大東亞民族而做為　民地的英美制勝，還是為了萬邦共存共榮的大東亞的戰爭制勝呢，天的利巳　是神明。所照　的了，而糾合地利人　獲　最後的勝利，知是大束亞民族今後的責任，大東亞戰爭是大東亞民族的戰爭，日華兩國以外的國家，也決不能算做第三者。</p>
<p>現在正起這個稿子的時候，又有第四次波浪維爾航空戰的捷報傳來了，不，今後無論有多少次戰爭，我們的勝利，也一定要貫徹到最後的。戰勝不僅是日本的責任總得　成為中國以及大東亞各國的責任和信念才可以。　君，我們每次聽到第一綫的戰況的時候，都是痛感到敵人也是在繼續看必死的作戰，在西歐的德國的勇戰和健鬥，一定也能　應着太平洋的勝利，達成他們的最後的目的。</p>
<p>現在還談甚麽是在三國會談的時候，對應四國宣言的，就是我們的必勝必中的鐵火，和大東亞民族魂的烈火，燒盡所有的東西而後巳。這個正義的火炎，現在在十億亞洲民族的胸裏，是烈烈的燃燒着，這個魂的火炎，遮蔽了天空，降下降　的利劍，而　　英美的　軍的日子，　漸的接近了。</p>
<p>當這個時候，團民政府舉行宣傳會議，把這個大義普達給世界萬邦，眞是覺得有着重大的意義的。</p>
<p>日華兩國為了樹立光被世界的正義，無論遭遇任何苦難，都不能認為是苦難，必須做為大東亞的中心，向着無我精進的大道邁進，感謝　位的靜聽。（完）</p>

        <h1>1943.11.23</h1>
<h3>Central Idea</h3>
<p>Thought itself is invisible and silent. When contained, it can be hidden within an inch of the heart, but when released, it fills the universe and generates majestic power. For the individual, the magnificence or despondency of one's spirit and attitude are invariably governed by thought, and the actions of a sage or a robber are invariably driven by thought. A nation and its people are originally an organic whole formed by individuals. People's minds naturally differ like their faces, but there must be some thoughts shared by the majority, which constitute the thoughts of the nation and its people. Among these, the one that occupies the absolute majority is the central idea of the nation and its people. The power of the central idea is sufficient to establish the nation's position and solidify its intentions. It cannot be shifted by force, let alone changed in a short period.</p>
<p>The meaning of the term "center" is mostly applicable to shapes and planes, while the interpretation of the term "center of gravity" is accurate in mechanics and physics. Knowing the location of an object's center of gravity allows one to know how to keep it balanced; otherwise, it will inevitably fall. The components of a nation and its people are individuals, just as the components of an object are point masses. To control an object, one must first explore its center of gravity; to grasp a nation and its people, one must first cultivate their central idea. Therefore, the central idea of a nation and its people can be regarded as the center of gravity of the nation and its people.</p>
<p>The higher an object's center of gravity, the easier it is to change its position and cause the object to overturn. The lower it is, the more it can maintain its position and keep the object stable. This is a natural law that applies to objects and everything else. Therefore, the more a central idea penetrates downward, the greater the power it exerts, and the more stable and resolute the position and intentions of the nation and its people become. An object's center of gravity has no good or evil, but a central idea can be correct or erroneous. The more a correct central idea is confined to the upper classes, the more insignificant its effect; the more an erroneous central idea penetrates the people, the greater its danger.</p>
<p>The two major nations of China and Japan coexist in Asia and should be loving and supportive of each other. However, in recent centuries, due to various factual provocations, their feelings have become increasingly hateful and contemptuous. Coupled with external instigation and alienation, they have gone in opposite directions, gradually forming an unshakable erroneous central idea. Even if there are insightful people in both countries who run around and appeal in an attempt to change the situation, and even if Dr. Sun Yat-sen created and advocated Pan-Asianism to enlighten us, there is still the occurrence of this Sino-Japanese Incident. Whose fault is this? It is due to the erroneous central idea!</p>
<p>Now that the National Government has returned to its capital, it has made restoring peace its mission, and its negotiations are aimed at realizing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will. At the same time, enlightened political leaders in Japan, with righteousness in mind, are promoting a new policy towards China based on the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, followed by the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. Recently, they abolished all past unequal treaties and established a Sino-Japanese alliance of mutual benefit and respect. Therefore, the terms used between the two major nations have changed from enemies to friendly nations to show goodwill. Now they call each other allies, and there must be even more brotherly affection. The obstacles that have existed between them for many years have been swept away, and the suspicions and jealousies between them naturally no longer exist. The authorities of both countries treat each other with sincerity and frankness, creating a new era in the history of Sino-Japanese diplomacy and opening a new path for the future of East Asia. We are truly delighted and overjoyed.</p>
<p>From now on, the erroneous central idea seems to have been eliminated, but the correct central idea still needs to be built with effort, and it must be made to penetrate from top to bottom to the lowest levels. The effectiveness of slogans and catchphrases is minimal for this penetration work. Only the facts experienced by women and children can achieve satisfactory results. It is hoped that the gains already made will crystallize into the center of gravity of the nation and its people, and that it will continue to move downward so that the entire group of the nation and its people cannot be tilted by any external force. Then, we can move forward to achieve the three major goals of overall peace, the revival of China, and the protection of Greater Asia.</p>
<h3>The Second National Propaganda Conference Holds a Grand Closing Ceremony. The General Resolution of the Conference is Read by Chairman Lin.</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Propaganda Department, in order to concentrate cultural propaganda forces to complete the ideological general battle and to gather wisdom, convened the Second National Propaganda Conference in Nanjing starting on the 20th. It gathered over a hundred representatives from party, government, cultural, and newspaper circles across the country for open discussions. The conference grandly opened on the 20th and, after three days, all the agenda was successfully completed on the afternoon of the 22nd. A closing ceremony was held at 5 PM that afternoon, presided over by the conference chairman, Lin Baisheng. After performing the rituals, Chairman Lin delivered a political report, which was divided into four points: 1. The development and course of this world war; 2. The current situation in the Pacific and Europe; 3. The future of China. All the representatives were deeply moved after listening. After the report, the general resolution was read. The propaganda director of the Su-Huai Special Zone, Gao Han, proposed a temporary motion that all attending representatives pay their respects to the conference chairman, Lin Baisheng. The motion was unanimously approved with applause. They bowed to Chairman Lin, and then Chairman Lin led the crowd in chanting "Support the Sino-Japanese Alliance," "Practice the Greater East Asia Declaration," "Concentrate Cultural Propaganda Forces," "Complete the Wartime Cultural System," "Eliminate Anglo-American Thought," "Complete the Greater East Asia War," "Long Live the Revival of Chinese Culture," "Long Live the Revival of East Asian Culture," "Long Live the Leader," "Long Live the Republic of China, Long Live, Long Long Live." Thus, the Second National Propaganda Conference</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Third Plenary Session of the Second National Propaganda Conference was held at 3 PM on the 22nd. First, Chairman Lin read out the general resolution of the Second National Propaganda Conference, which was unanimously approved by all the representatives. Then, Chairman Lin reported on the number of proposals from the Second National Propaganda Conference. A total of 141 items were submitted to the Second Conference for discussion, plus two temporary motions. It was resolved to pass 124 items, which were sent to the Propaganda Department for reference and implementation. These were divided into: 42 items on propaganda administration; 33 items on propaganda guidance; 29 items on general propaganda undertakings; 18 items on special propaganda; and 2 temporary motions. 17 items were not discussed on a special project. After the report was completed, the third meeting was declared complete in enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Chairman Wang of the National Government, in order to comfort the representatives of the Second National Propaganda Conference, personally attended the conference venue at 4 PM on the third afternoon of the National Propaganda Conference, hosted a tea party, and met with the participating representatives individually, inquiring in great detail for more than an hour. He took a group photo with all the representatives and then left the venue amidst the respectful farewell of the crowd and the sound of military music. Before leaving, the Chairman distributed a portrait of himself to each participating representative to encourage them to continue their efforts in their respective positions. Everyone was deeply grateful for the Chairman's great personality and heartfelt concern. In addition, Committee Member Chen Bijun presented each participant with a copy of the Chairman's speech "East Asians Don't Fight East Asians, Brothers are Still Brothers, How to Build Greater Shanghai," and a consolidated edition of the "Instructions for Soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force." All the representatives were deeply grateful upon receiving them.</p>
<p>Passage of the General Resolution</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The original text of the general resolution passed by the Second National Propaganda Conference is as follows: "The focus of ideological struggle lies in propaganda, and the foundation of national construction depends on culture. Since the start of the peace movement, our comrades on the Fourth Front, under the guidance of the supreme leader, have been fighting with a clear and resolute spirit to establish thought, not shying away from sacrifice and striving to be pioneers. They have strived for the expansion of peace and the realization of unity with efforts in their respective positions. In the year following the return of the government to the capital, the first National Propaganda Conference was convened in the capital. Since then, the internal and external situations have undergone tremendous changes. The signing of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty laid a solid foundation for peace, followed by the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, which sounded the alarm for East Asian freedom and liberation. This year, the National Government's participation in the war further completed its long-cherished wish for independence and autonomy. Recently, China and Japan revised their treaties, establishing an alliance of justice with a spirit of morality, and further united with various East Asian countries to issue the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, which is precisely realizing our founding father's will and embarking on the road to co-prosperity in East Asia, a good opportunity in a thousand years. Looking at the domestic situation, although there are still those who are stubbornly unenlightened, obstructing peace, and hindering unity, and even sacrificing compatriots and destroying the seeds of independence in Burma and India, it is heartbreaking to speak of. However, the trend is that the end of Anglo-American imperialism has arrived, and the completion of China's independence and autonomy and the realization of East Asian co-existence and co-prosperity cannot be stopped by any force. We can only persevere in our original intentions and encourage ourselves. This year, the Supreme National Defense Council passed the Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy, and the correction of thought already has the highest standards. The greatest theme of this National Propaganda Conference is to establish a wartime cultural propaganda system, mobilize the total force of cultural propaganda, and promote unification to complete the war. It happens to be after the signing of the Sino-Japanese alliance and the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration, so its mission is undoubtedly of great importance. This conference reviews the past, looks forward to the future, and vows to follow the instructions of the Supreme Leader, not shying away from difficulties or dangers. That is our gun. With sincerity and unity, we will strive and fight. Even if we die on the battlefield, we will not hesitate. We will strictly follow the Basic Outline of the Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy and the resolutions of the conference, strengthen the work of various departments, plan to establish a news and publishing association, literary writing construction, and complete the wartime cultural propaganda system. Internally, we will arouse the people, eliminate obstacles to peace, and complete the construction of unity. Externally, we will stimulate the national war fighting mood, follow the allied countries, aid India, and eliminate the United States and Britain to win the victory in the Greater East Asia War and seek the liberation of the East Asian nations. This is the resolution."</p>

In addition, I also have the following feelings about the situation in Japan: First, the whole country is working hard to complete the war; Second, the posture of the national general uprising has reached completion; Third, the wartime system has been completed; Fourth, the supply and demand of materials are smooth and temporarily affluent. In short, all the material and spiritual resources of the allied Japan have been completely concentrated on completing the war.</p>

<h3>Japan Decides to Provide Full Assistance to Manchuria's Agricultural Land Reclamation Plan. Implementation is Scheduled for Next Year and Expected to be Completed Within Two Years</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - During this war, Manchuria not only cooperated with Japan with various materials, but also contributed greatly to Japan directly and indirectly in terms of food and other aspects. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and the public and private sectors have expressed deep gratitude for this, and the inseparable relationship between Japan and Manchuria has become even more consolidated. Manchuria bears the mission of being a food base, and the current situation has further increased its task. In view of this situation, Manchuria has established a new emergency plan to reclaim vast agricultural land, and at the same time plans to implement existing agricultural land reclamation plans in advance. The two plans have been combined to draft an emergency agricultural land reclamation plan, which was submitted to the Japanese government a few days ago for cooperation in order to achieve it. The Japanese government, with the Greater East Asia Ministry as the center, reviewed the case and, after summarizing opinions from all sides, decided to accept the proposal. The basic policy of Japan's cooperation and assistance to the case has also been drafted and passed at the regular cabinet meeting on the 22nd. The enemy purpose of the cooperative assistance plan has been announced by the Japanese Information Bureau. At the same time, Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki made a statement clarifying the outline of the implementation plan. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 22nd: Manchuria believes that the mission of the food base under the current situation is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, it has further proposed an emergency agricultural land reclamation plan. The Imperial Government also gladly accepted it and passed it at today's cabinet meeting. Regarding the assistance plan, the Japanese side will provide comprehensive cooperation and assistance in materials, funds, and technology for the implementation of the plan, so as to jointly move towards strengthening the food self-sufficiency posture.</p>
<h3>Active Food Production Increase is a Major Contribution to Japan</h3>
<p>Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki said in a statement that Manchuria is currently making every effort to increase food production and is planning to supply it to Japan, which is something we are sincerely grateful for. Now, in view of the food supply and demand relationship, Manchuria's mission as a food base has become even more important, and we very much expect Manchuria to actively increase food production in the future. In order to rapidly adapt to this demand, the Manchurian government will thoroughly strengthen all past measures and establish a groundbreaking agricultural land reclamation plan. In order to implement the plan, General Manager Takebe was sent to Tokyo to submit the proposal to our country. Our government, based on the proposal, reviewed it with the relevant administrative authorities and reached a consensus. At today's cabinet meeting, it was passed and a basic policy for cooperation and assistance to the plan was decided. This emergency agricultural land reclamation plan is scheduled to be implemented next year and completed in Showa 20 (1945), opening up new paddy fields in the Second Songhua River area and the East Liao River area in a short period of only two years, and implementing the existing land reclamation plan in advance. Once completed, the food produced will be supplied to our country, contributing to the adjustment of our food supply and demand relationship. As far as the Imperial Government is concerned, in order to complete the plan, it will actively participate and cooperate in all aspects of funding, materials, and technology. There will inevitably be many difficulties in promoting this project in the future, so it is hoped that Japan and Manchuria will further cooperate closely, and the relationship between the two countries should be more sincerely cooperative and deeply understood. After the implementation of this plan, the food self-sufficiency posture of Japan and Manchuria will be further strengthened. This is truly worthy of celebration during the war. Here, I express my deep gratitude to Manchuria's kindness.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army in Lishui Completes the Encirclement Strategy and Continues to Pursue and Advance Fiercely in a Certain Direction</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - A certain unit of the Japanese army annihilated the 73rd Army of the Chongqing army on the banks of the Fengshui River and captured Linli and Cili in one fell swoop. On the morning of the 19th, a pursuit battle began, and they continued to advance fiercely in a certain direction. That evening, they approached the main force of the 44th Army of the Chongqing army in the Qijiahe (47 kilometers southwest of Linli) area. On the 20th, the encirclement was completed, and the air and ground forces cooperated to launch an annihilation battle. By the 21st, the main force of the 44th Army of the Chongqing army had been annihilated. According to the captured Chongqing military officers, the 19th and 55th Divisions were also encircled by the Japanese army in this battle. The Japanese army, which was heading south, achieved even greater results south of Cili in this battle. The battle was launched on the morning of the 20th, and the Japanese air force cooperated with the ground forces to strafe and bomb the Chongqing army, which was trying to retreat southwest. The two divisions of the 74th Army of the Chongqing army are now like candles in the wind. In response to this, the Japanese army, which captured Linli, rapidly attacked a location 45 kilometers southwest of Linli at 5 PM on the 20th, and is continuing to attack fiercely with the goal of occupying the Chongqing army's stronghold. It is said that the 19th Army Group of the Chongqing army is already on the verge of collapse, and the offensive of the Japanese army in various directions is becoming more and more smooth.</p>
<p>The Japanese Air Force Fiercely Bombs the Mountains South of Cili</p>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Central China front, the Japanese air force fiercely bombed the mountainous area south of Cili twice on the 21st in order to cooperate with the Japanese army in advancing, encircling, and annihilating in the south of Nuli, inflicting heavy damage on the main forces of the 51st and 58th Divisions of the 74th Army of the Chongqing army.</p>

They immediately bombed them, inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese planes returned safely to their original defenses. Another team of Japanese planes discovered a Chongqing army boat unit near Taoyuan, traveling on the Yuan River. They immediately sank two of their 200-ton boats and destroyed another three. They then fiercely bombed the Chongqing army's stronghold in Changde, destroying its military facilities and inflicting heavy damage before the planes safely returned to their original defenses.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army in Shandong Occupies Many Important Strongholds</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the northern Shandong front, the Japanese army in Shandong has cut off Chongqing's eastern connections everywhere since the start of the mop-up operation in northern Shandong on the 21st. On the 19th, they controlled the key points of the Chongqing army and are continuing to mop up the Chongqing army lurking in all directions. In addition, the Japanese army units advancing southward from the north are gradually narrowing the encirclement and, with the cooperation of Japanese planes, are mopping up the Chongqing army in the middle. Another unit of the Japanese army crossed the Xiaqing River mouth near Yangjiaowan and encountered the Chongqing army north of Yangjiaowan. They are currently pursuing them. The Japanese army attacking from the southwest of Lijin broke through the center of the Chongqing army and arrived near Xinzhen on the 18th.

<h3>Famine in Bengal, India, Followed by Epidemic</h3>
<p>Stanford, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A New Delhi correspondent for the Daily Telegraph recently reported on the famine situation throughout the Indian province of Bengal, stating: The famine in Bengal has not yet been alleviated, and it is now followed by major epidemics in many areas. At least one million people are now suffering from insufficient food, leading to a loss of resistance to disease. Cholera, dysentery, malaria, pneumonia, and influenza were originally common ailments among the Indian people in Bengal, but now cholera has spread to Calcutta and other areas, while dysentery and malignant malaria are also commonly prevalent. As winter approaches, the starving people are poorly clothed, greatly increasing the risk of pneumonia, and influenza will likely seize the opportunity to spread throughout the province. There are very few doctors and nurses in India, and even fewer hospitals, so there is no way to prevent the rampaging epidemic. I am not saying this to create alarm, nor as a critic, but from the perspective of an observer. Although the Governor-General of India and the Bengal provincial government have adopted all methods to try to avoid this crisis, their efforts have been ineffective.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Convenes Provincial Police Conference</h3>

All proposals and reports must be submitted to the department by the end of this month. The provincial government and the Ministry of Interior will send representatives to provide guidance at that time.</p>
<h3>Minister Matsushima's Speech at the Propaganda Conference</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) On the evening of the 5th, our naval air forces discovered an enemy mobile force composed of two aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and two destroyers in the sea south of Bougainville Island. Thereupon, using only a small number of 18 aircraft, they attacked, and in the blink of an eye, sank one large aircraft carrier, one medium-sized aircraft carrier, two large cruisers, and two cruisers or large destroyers. As a result, the enemy was almost completely destroyed by us. However, our losses were only three aircraft. This battle is called the First Air Battle of Bougainville Island. But following this battle, another great victory that astonished the world unfolded in the southern seas.</p>
<p>This can truly be called the Second Air Battle of Bougainville Island. From the morning of November 8th, our naval air forces began a fierce attack on the attacking enemy transport convoy and escort fleet. As a result, we achieved a great victory second only to the Battle of Hawaii, destroying four battleships, sinking two cruisers, heavily damaging three or more large cruisers, sinking three destroyers, setting fire to and heavily damaging three cruisers or large destroyers, sinking four transport ships, heavily damaging one large transport ship, and shooting down more than twelve aircraft. Our losses this time were only 15 aircraft that did not return.</p>
<p>This at once annihilated the enemy's large transport convoy, and during operations in the Solomon Islands, approximately a week before, when the Bougainville Island counterattack began, MacArthur convened a conference with Halsey, commander of the fleet, Harmon, commander of the land forces, and Kryder, commander of the Marine Corps. At that time, boasting with an attitude of absolute confidence, he said, "We will capture Bougainville Island within a week and then establish a combined battle and bomber airbase." But this statement resulted in a very tragic outcome and was truly an indirect irony.</p>
<p>Regarding the results of the Second Air Battle of Bougainville Island, His Majesty the Emperor bestowed gracious words upon the Combined Fleet, and the morale of the fleet soared even higher. On November 11th, braving hazardous weather day and night, they caught the enemy mobile force on the sea south of Bougainville Island and attacked. As a result, one cruiser or large destroyer was sunk, one battleship was moderately damaged, two large aircraft carriers and one large cruiser were slightly damaged, three large cruisers or large destroyers were heavily damaged and set on fire, and one destroyer was heavily damaged and set on fire, and two aircraft were shot down. Our suicide and non-returning aircraft also accounted for a loss of thirty aircraft. It is thought that the enemy must also have defended to the death. This was the Third Air Battle of Bougainville Island.</p>
<p>But the enemy did not change their ways and attacked again. So on the 13th, the Fourth Air Battle of Bougainville Island unfolded again in the sea south of that island. As a result, one large cruiser and one cruiser were sunk, one destroyer was sunk, and one battleship and one medium aircraft carrier were heavily damaged. We also lost two aircraft. Then, at dawn on the 17th, the Fifth Air Battle unfolded in the same battlefield, trapping the enemy's mobile forces between the two wings of our naval forces. One large aircraft carrier was sunk, two medium-sized aircraft carriers, three cruisers, and one battleship were sunk (ship type unknown). We achieved a truly overwhelming victory, but we only lost five aircraft.</p>
<p>Despite such consecutive battles, the enemy's persistence and their enthusiasm for operations around Bougainville Island and Rabaul did not change. From this, we can infer that we are drawing the enemy to this sea area for this reason, successively shattering them into the seaweed beneath the sea. This kind of operation is truly extremely gratifying.</p>
<p>I believe that what the American forces are trying to do is on one hand to seize our bases in the Solomon Islands, and on the other hand to advance into northern New Guinea, pincer and take the Bismarck area, in order to secure a foothold in the southwestern Pacific. They aim to break through the Philippines or our inner South Seas strongholds in one fell swoop, separating the Japanese mainland from important resource production areas, and thoroughly striking our war power. The enemy's efforts to reverse the advantageous war situation from this perspective are truly fierce to the extreme. They are recklessly sacrificing in their anxiety to achieve their goals at once, and at the same time, this anxiety is on the other hand revealing that their domestic situation has become extremely difficult due to repeated defeats and huge losses of human resources. The more anxious the enemy becomes, the greater their losses, and the result they consider most desirable is the result of our best-prepared naval warfare.</p>
<p>Next is the enemy's resistance from the Burma front. Since Lord Mountbatten became commander-in-chief, preparations seem to be underway by land, sea, and air. According to a Washington dispatch from the 5th, a tripartite military guidance conference was held in Chongqing to deliberate on future strategies. But this kind of conference is truly a common tactic of the enemy, just like what military strategists have said since ancient times, "Be cautious in warfare, do not rush into battle." They have been clamoring for a large-scale beginning as soon as the rainy season is over, but to this day, their resistance operations have not yet materialized.</p>
<p>However, aerial warfare on this front is gradually becoming more intense. On October 10th in the past, they launched a large-scale attack on Rangoon with over a hundred aircraft. And since September, they have increased from 1,000 aircraft to 1,600. The main purpose is to disrupt our rear or supply lines with all their strength, or to repeatedly blindly bomb undefended cities. Apart from killing innocent civilians, it does no damage to our military.</p>
<p>In the operations on this front, our elite army air forces are always on duty in Burma, French Indochina, Thailand, and Malaya, covering this vast area, constantly providing air defense, preemptively striking, destroying the enemy air force, or thwarting the enemy's plans.</p>
<p>As for large-scale enemy resistance, it is believed that it is difficult for the enemy as well. Firstly, the terrain is complex, and secondly, supplies are difficult. Especially the most important problem is the command of the three countries, England, America, and China, which are completely different in nature. In this war, the position of Chen Cheng's Chongqing army is most noteworthy.</p>
<p>On the 10th of last month, Chongqing held the first send-off party for Indian conscripts, sending 400 conscripts over 158 cm tall and weighing over 84 kg to India for training. This event was heavily publicized. Like this, for the sake of destroying the eternal peace of Greater East Asia and freeing themselves from the everlasting suffering of the loss of their own land and people, what kind of feelings should those conscripts who have especially rushed to distant India have in their hearts?</p>
<p>As you all know, India has a population of over 400 million. If England and America want to, they might still have a chance if they appeal to these people to some extent. But a large portion of the Indian people are suffering from irremediable hunger and hardship; it can be said that they are starving everywhere. It is truly because of Britain's evil policies that they have turned the birthplace of Buddhism into a hell of suffering. On the one hand, the conscientious people of India are wholeheartedly following the grand declaration issued by Chandra Bose's Provisional Government of India, but under the oppression of the Americans and British before their eyes, even if their hearts do not comply, they can only superficially submit. At this time, the Americans and British are not making their own citizens shed a single drop of blood, but instead, from the standpoint of local supply, they are using the people of India and Chongqing to create a blast shield in front, while they themselves, well-fed and warmly clothed, are smoking, drinking, and plotting to advance toward seizing China's concessions. Those conscripts selected in Chongqing are all extremely excellent in intelligence and physical strength. We truly do not know the true intentions of Chongqing in having them carry out the destruction of Greater East Asia. We especially cannot help but sympathize with the parents, siblings, and relatives of these truly honest young people.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, it has been said that "do not start an army without a justifiable cause for the great righteousness of China." It is truly unnecessary to say more about the incomprehensible act of causing innocent young people to shed blood for a war without a cause. The preemptive attacks by the forces in the India-Burma area were repelled to the east bank of the Nu River, and their boasted cooperation with England and America has also collapsed. (The following continues in the fourth section.)</p>
<h3>Director of the Press Department, Mr. Mishina's Speech at the National Propaganda Conference: Two Great Victories and the Fate of the Greater East Asia Ethnic Group</h3>
<p>Central News Agency – Mr. Mishina, Director of the Press Department of the Japanese Dispatch Army Headquarters in China, delivered a speech at the Second National Propaganda Conference, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>In the past twenty days, we have recorded two great victories in history in both spiritual and material aspects. One is the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and the other is the results of the several naval air battles of Bougainville Island. Two years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Under this great war of Greater East Asia, the ten million people of Greater East Asia, in order to break free from the shackles of England and America, and seeking to build a unified ideal in the ideals and wills of Asia, have revealed to the world in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The five major principles contained therein clearly indicate the path for all of humanity to advance to a new civilization and peace. We know clearly that there is no point in comparing the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration with the countless deceptive and fraudulent declarations and statements issued by the Anglo-American camp. However, we feel regret that as a member of Greater East Asia, someone who should bear the responsibility and glory of building Greater East Asia actually flattered the Anglo-American hypocritical and empty declarations and deliberately defamed the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. We find this attitude of that party regrettable in terms of Asian morality.</p>
<p>Looking at the first article of the Joint Declaration regarding the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity in East Asia, it states that "Greater East Asian countries jointly ensure the stability of Greater East Asia, and based on morality, establish an order of coexistence and co-prosperity." Sun Yat-sen, the Father of China, also said, "To realize Pan-Asianism, we must base ourselves on our country's inherent culture, which is morality, which is benevolence and righteousness." This principle of coexistence and co-prosperity coincides with the thought of Sun Yat-sen, the Father of China. This solemn fact cannot be denied by anyone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the second article regarding the principle of autonomy, independence, and amity states that "Greater East Asian countries mutually respect their autonomy and independence, seek mutual assistance and harmony, and establish amity in Greater East Asia." This is what is said in "China's Destiny": "The freedom of Asian nations and the equality of countries are the guarantee of world peace forever (omitted). The principles of national freedom and national equality should apply to the peaceful international organization after the war. The League of Nations established after the First World War failed mainly because it obliterated this principle. The concepts of so-called 'world powers' or 'spheres of influence' and the systems formed by these concepts should no longer be seen in the equal international organization after the Second World War." This genuine desire for national freedom and equality is the principle of mutual respect and amity among Greater East Asian countries, and it cannot be concealed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the third article regarding the principle of promoting East Asian culture states that "Greater East Asian countries mutually respect their traditions, develop the creativity of each nation, and illuminate the culture of Greater East Asia." How should we observe the principle of mutual respect for traditions and promoting culture? "China's Destiny" said that "the freedom and independence of national states in world culture takes the freedom and independence of culture as an essential element." Therefore, should we seek the ideal of national culture from the democratic civilization of England and America, or should we seek it from the inherent Kingly Way of the East's principles of governance and peace?</p>
<p>Next, the fourth article regarding the principle of economic cooperation and prosperity states that "Greater East Asian countries, under mutual benefit, closely cooperate, develop their common economy, and increase the prosperity of Greater East Asia." This is the principle of developing the economy and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fifth article regarding the principle of contributing to the progress of the world states that "Greater East Asian countries increase friendship among nations, eliminate racial discrimination, universally communicate culture, and further develop resources, in order to contribute to the development of the world." This is the principle of contributing to the development of the world. Comparing this with the principles of "equal rights for all countries to trade and access world resources" and "achieving a free world" in the so-called Atlantic Charter of England and America, what is the difference between their ideals and reality?</p>
<p>Think about which country erected high tariff barriers, hindered and oppressed Japan's peaceful trade, and dared to carry out economic severance. Which country used conspiracies to monopolize the colonial resources of countries in the Western Hemisphere. Looking at the elimination of racial discrimination, England and America loudly chant freedom and peace, and claim to guarantee the healthy and peaceful lives of all nations, but look at the cruel and blatant discriminatory treatment of black people, and their unbreakable discriminatory views and contempt for colored people in Asia. Even without Lin Yutang's warning, it is clear. Therefore, hoping that England and America will have a change of heart, abolish unequal treaties, and abolish the laws prohibiting Chinese immigration is a pathetic delusion. The utilitarian worldview of the Anglo-Saxon people is an incurable flaw that can never be removed, and their multi-faceted treacherous diplomacy is a well-known fact. Their conspiracy to dominate Asia again and control China has shed the old guise and is using a unique and cunning new means, namely, "forming an American mixed air force" and "completely controlling the air force of that party" and "lending money to that party to dominate its financial economy as a semi-colony." Comparing this with the fundamental ideas and honest and decisive construction and practice of our Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and even the fact that the Papuan people are participating in politics, the difference is like heaven and earth.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is the way of the King, fair and just. It is an immortal international charter that will change the history of the world, and it is something that everyone's conscience cannot help but affirm. Now, let us turn to the results of the several naval air battles of Bougainville Island. We have the right to demand accurate observation and judgment from the world.</p>
<p>We have warned that before the counterattacks of the anti-Axis forces reach a certain line, they will encounter the defense line of our mighty Greater East Asia. The larger and more intense the scale of their counterattacks, the more certain they will suffer a tragic fate of enormous consumption and annihilation. Their so-called counterattack on Burma, counterattack on the Pacific, and even the widely publicized East Asia offensive are an excellent opportunity for us to encircle and annihilate the enemy that we have been seeking. What fate will the great war power and material power boasted by England and America meet in East Asia? They themselves will experience it, and this has already been foretold. And the several naval air battles of Bougainville Island are truly a painful experience for the American side.</p>
<p>In addition to sinking or destroying their six battleships and eight aircraft carriers, by the fifth air battle, the enemy had lost over one hundred and thirty ships, over five hundred and thirty aircraft, and no fewer than 20,000 troops, showing that they have paid a high price. Indeed, the East Asia counterattack of England and America cannot be considered to have been thwarted at this point. Their reckless counterattack will still rely on their sole advantage of "quantity" and continue to unfold. However, what do the results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters sufficiently prove? That is, the victory or defeat of modern warfare is by no means a matter of luck, but is determined by the gathering of the total power of the nation. The announcement of these results directly demonstrates the superiority of Japan's war power and human resources, and proves the victory of Japan's domestic aviation technology, the establishment of planned production, and the ability to adapt to the enemy's quantitative counterattacks and complete the domestic wartime system. The observation that Japan's war power is declining and its national strength will develop flaws is a misunderstanding of the essence of the Japanese national polity and the vitality of the Japanese people. To still cling to their prejudice, to observe with a slant eye, is truly to be called "intellectual and personality bankrupts" who are not worthy of speaking about the Greater East Asian national renaissance. Therefore, it is foolish and pitiable to rely on "a joint war with England and America," "a counterattack on Burma," and "a four-nation joint declaration" to dream of winning the war and entrust themselves to postwar construction. A nation's revolution can only be completed with complete autonomy and independence and the unification of the nation within the country. This is the unchangeable truth of ancient and modern times. At this current stage of human history, in this environment of national survival, the one who can control fate without chaos is the one who has a clear understanding of ancient and modern times and a steadfast, unwavering faith.</p>
<p>The above is said to commemorate two great common victories sent to the East Asia War, sufficient to enable the Greater East Asian countries and peoples, and the leading pioneers, to gain a victory in the overall war for their future joint construction. We firmly believe that the fate of the Greater East Asia ethnic group will be able to obtain the glory of victory.</p>
<h3>The German Army in Zhitomir Advances Sixty Li; Soviet Army Launches Diversionary Offensive</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Huitong News Agency, the Soviet army launched a vigorous attack from both the north and south yesterday, attempting to cut off the German forces in the bend of the Dnieper River. With the assistance of aircraft, the German army crushed two Soviet tank units and eight to ten infantry divisions. When the Soviet army attacked the German bridgeheads in Nikopol and northwest and north of Krivoy Rog, they pushed southwest toward Dnepropetrovsk with tank units. On the broad front, the Soviet army only broke through the German lines east of Vasilyevka and is currently being encircled. To the west, fierce fighting is taking place for the road between Zhitomir and Kiev. After heavy rain, the road is almost impassable. Although the Soviet army laid mines, the German army continues to advance. According to military sources, with the efforts of engineers, they have advanced to about 60 kilometers east of Zhitomir. Southwest of the confluence of the Pripyat and Dnieper rivers, fierce battles continue despite the adverse weather. The Korosten area is particularly intense.</p>
<p>Stockholm and Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The German army's counter-offensive on the Eastern Front has improved the situation in the Kiev sector. Fighting there remains fierce. At the same time, the Soviet army launched a major offensive in the Dnieper River bend area, attempting to break through the German lines at Krivoy Rog, Dnepropetrovsk, and Nikopol in one fell swoop. However, the German army immediately launched a fierce counterattack, resulting in fierce fighting. The German army destroyed 247 Soviet tanks, completely halting the Soviet advance. In the Zaporozhye area, the Soviet army is conducting a river crossing operation on the Dnieper River and is continuously reinforcing the west bank. The aim of this Soviet move is clearly to divert the German army's counter-offensive in Zhitomir.</p>
<p>Soviet Army's Landing Attempt in Kosh Failed</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Military sources report that the Soviet army attempted a landing from the Eltyngen bridgehead south of Kerch the night before last. This was the first landing attempt by the Soviet army in several days, with the aim of reinforcing the Soviet forces there with troops and equipment. That night and the next day, under the protection of gunboats, the Soviet army used 20 transport ships to attempt a landing, but they were repulsed by the German army. Three Soviet ships were sunk, and only three reached their destination.</p>

<h3>Winter Relief Fundraising Committee Holds First Meeting; Fundraising Goal Initially Set at 10 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report - The winter relief effort in this city this year, since the Winter Relief Fundraising Committee's active efforts, has set its fundraising goal at 10 million yuan as a standard. With the onset of the cold winter, in order to complete the winter relief mission, the fundraising work needs to be expanded. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Winter Relief Fundraising Committee held its first meeting of fundraising committee members and team leaders at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. The meeting was presided over by Chen Gongbo, the concurrent chief captain, and Ding Mocun and Zhao Xunyue, the concurrent deputy chief captains. More than 300 team leaders attended, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>More Than 300 Team Leaders Attended</p>
<p>In addition to the attendance of Chief Captain Chen, Deputy Chief Captains Ding and Zhao, the standing committee members and staff members Li Sihao, Shao Shijun, Wu Yunzhai, Wu Songgao, Lin Kanghou, Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, Sun Mingqi, Sun Lifu, Ling Xianwen, Geng Jiaji, Sheng Youyi, Huang Jinrong (represented by Long Tianjian), Wen Lantin, Pei Yunqing, Zhao Jinqing, Qian Dade, etc., and the committee members and team leaders Ding Fangyuan, Ding Houqing, Wang Boyuan, Wang Jingxian, Wang Yongkang, Wang Weiguan, Wang Shuxian, Ba Lingyun, Gan Dounan, Shi Yongsai, Zhu Senlin, Jiang Shangda, Zhu Chuanquan, Zhu Shunlin, Zhu Yinjiang, Shen Siliang, Shen Weiting, Shen Jinzhou, Shen Weiya, Li Zulie, Li Wenjie, Li Tianzhen, Wang Zhenhuan, He Wuliang, He Zhuoxian, Han Zhongfu, Wu Chenxiu, Du Huafang, Zhou Youchang, Zhou Bangjun, Jin Zongcheng, Lin Zhaopin, Song Jingze, Hu Zhonggeng, Xia Shikui, Xu Tieshan, Xu Maotang, Xu Langxi, Chen Fukang, Chen Shaofu, Chen Zhongnan, Chen Shui Li, Qin Runchang, Lu Wenshao, Guo Shun, Ku Linshuang, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Guanqun, Xu Jianhong, Zhang Rongchu, Zhang Yipeng, Zhang Deqin, Huang Jiangquan, Huang Zhensheng, Xiang Kangyuan, Ye Juexiao, Pan Yangyao, Pan Xusheng, Liu Yangshan, Zan Yanfang, Qian Zongfan, Xie Xiaochu, Feng Wenguang, Yan Chuntang, and more than 300 others attended.</p>
<p>Focusing Efforts on Promoting Relief</p>
<p>The meeting was chaired by Chief Captain Chen, with Hu Shiqi and Si Manyue recording. First, Chairman Chen reported on the purpose of convening the meeting today and the intention to unify the fundraising of charitable funds in the future. Starting today with winter relief, the initial fundraising goal for this year is set at 10 million yuan. If there are surplus funds raised, they will be designated for next year's winter relief expenses. He hoped that influential figures in this city would take more responsibility and enthusiastically support the effort. Next, Deputy Chief Captain Ding reported that raising funds for winter relief is part of social welfare undertakings. In the past, fundraising was often done independently, with each entity acting on its own, which often led to difficulties. After the establishment of the Social Welfare Funding Committee this time, this year's winter relief fundraising, under the initiation of the municipal government and the committee, established a Winter Relief Fundraising Committee to concentrate efforts, enabling unification and specialized handling. Cooperation is also relied upon in terms of work, and it is hoped that influential figures in this city will provide more assistance. Subsequently, Deputy Chief Captain Zhao reported that the relief work in the future has been prepared and will be carried out with a focused spirit to achieve satisfactory results, and he hoped for guidance and assistance at any time. Finally, team leader representatives Wen Lantin, Li Sihao, and Zhang Yipeng successively delivered speeches, deeply hoping that everyone present would work hard and take responsibility for fundraising. 369 donation booklets were distributed, with each team's fundraising goal set at 50,000 yuan as a standard, with more being better. The fundraising period is limited to the end of December of this year. The meeting adjourned with refreshments at 4:30 PM.</p>

<h3>From Cultivating Technical Talents to the Question of Apprentices' Education</h3>
<p>— Xu Jialing</p>
<p>Amidst this clamor of cultivating technical talents, we have pointed out that the reasons for our technical backwardness are: first, upper-level technical personnel do not seek progress; second, lower-level workers are content with the status quo. But why are lower-level workers content with the status quo? Of course, there are many reasons, but the employer's aversion to workers seeking education is also a major reason.</p>
<p>Of course, it is impossible to seek education during the day because of work. Then, what about at night? Workers should be allowed to study on their own or attend night school, but factories and stores still dislike it. This does not have much impact on workers who can be self-reliant and have more freedom of action. However, it has made it difficult for a group of apprentices who have not yet completed their apprenticeships and a group of trainees who live in the store. But what are the reasons for factories and stores to interfere with apprentices' education?</p>
<p>Let us try to summarize the employer's reasons:</p>
<p>Apprentices who study at night do not get enough sleep, which will inevitably lead to listlessness during the day, or even dozing off, affecting work efficiency.</p>
<p>Apprentices who read and study on their own at night will inevitably consume more electricity.</p>
<p>Apprentices who return to the store after 10:00 PM will disturb the sleep of others.</p>
<p>Apprentices who go out frequently are prone to cheating.</p>
<p>Apprentices may use the excuse of studying to go out at will for improper entertainment.</p>
<p>We do not deny their reasons, but let us think about it.</p>
<p>Returning to the factory at 10:00 PM and studying for one hour, waking up at 6:00 AM the next morning, totals seven hours of sleep, only one hour short of the standard sleep time. For those who are physically strong, it will often have no impact. Even if the factory believes that eight hours of sleep is necessary, then it can allow them to sleep immediately after returning, so there is no need to worry about insufficient sleep. Moreover, due to the increase in apprentices' knowledge, it is beneficial to the progress of affairs, so will the efficiency of work not increase instead?</p>
<p>As for the electricity bill, I think that for a factory or store of this size, it should not be too calculating about the small cost of one or two hours of electricity. Even if the factory believes that it must be calculated, then it can simply require the apprentices to sleep as soon as they return, or the apprentices can get up early to study on their own. Otherwise, the apprentices can be asked to reimburse the electricity bill on a monthly basis. But how can there be such a store owner in the world? I think.</p>
<p>The store owner's reasons are too selfish, so he uses the safety of the entire dormitory's workers as an excuse. But what is the truth? Because the workers have the same unfortunate experiences, they have a deep understanding of each other, so the feelings are very good. They will never interfere with a colleague studying (unless there are a few jealous people with ulterior motives). This is a kind of human nature - compassion. Moreover, doing homework is not fooling around and must make a lot of noise. The most obvious thing is that the library is much quieter than the hotel. Even if the store is still worried, then it can just let them sleep as soon as they return.</p>
<p>As for cheating, this is a question of the apprentice's character. The store owner should of course look at the apprentice's character before taking in an apprentice. Who would want to take in a bad apprentice? Cheating is a crime. Why would a good, free person want to commit a crime? What kind of person commits a crime? Is it those who seek to improve themselves who are willing to commit crimes? Moreover, school is a place to cultivate good character!</p>
<p>As for apprentices using the excuse of studying to engage in improper entertainment, this point is more likely. The apprentice says to the factory that he is studying, and to the school, he says that he is busy with factory affairs. So, after arranging everything on both sides, he lives a debauched life. However, this point is not unavoidable. As long as the factory and the school have close contact, the school can often send people to visit the factory, and at the same time, the factory can often inquire with the school. In this way, not only can the students complete good character and academics under the cooperation of the school and the factory, but also promote direct contact and cooperation between the school and the business community.</p>
<p>In our country, the number of apprentices is quite astonishing. Among this group of pitiful comrades, perhaps there are many buried geniuses. I hope that employers can try their best to change their past attitudes and encourage self-study and education, so that this group of gold in the mud can be unearthed. Then, in the near future, the technical talents of the Republic of China will not have to worry about being few and inferior.</p>
<p>Due to the employer's encouragement of education, I think that the lower-level workers' contentment with the status quo will definitely be quickly eliminated. At the same time, because of the lower-level personnel's increased skills, they will force the upper-level personnel to seek further progress. With the promotion at each level, who says our country has no hope?</p>
<p>Review of Improving the Child Labor System</p>
<p>The issue of child labor is an economic problem that economists in various countries pay close attention to, but in our country, very few people pay attention to this problem. Our country's child labor system is prevalent in society, and its malpractices are more severe than in other countries in the world. Under the current "production first" wartime situation, the prevalence of child labor directly hinders production, so we have the inevitability of bringing it up for review.</p>
<p>Child labor originated very early, and its main cause is poverty. The earliest child laborers only helped with simple tasks in the family, learning and being taught at the same time, accompanied by their parents, so the harm was relatively small. Since the Industrial Revolution, child laborers have been sent from home to society. These underage laborers are favored by employers with lower standards. Because child laborers have no labor unions to back them, they will not strike, and their wages can be suppressed to be lower than those of adults. The above two reasons have caused the extreme development of the child labor system.</p>
<p>The development of child labor is harmful and unhelpful to production, children, society, the country, and so on. Its main drawbacks are five: Child laborers engage in monotonous work for more than ten hours a day, and their physical and mental strength is damaged. Illiteracy accounts for nine out of ten, and in the future, they are very likely to commit crimes and engage in behaviors that are detrimental to society. The increase in child laborers increases labor competition, and capitalists use this point to reduce wages, making the lives of laborers more difficult. Laborers cannot satisfy their basic needs, and their work efficiency will inevitably decrease. It destroys children's physical and mental health, thus hindering their development and easily producing bad citizens. Child laborers are "cheap labor" rather than "economic labor." Because child laborers often lack skills, they easily waste materials and machines. Child laborers lose both school education and family education, which easily leads to moral decline, weak will, and a lack of equal concepts.</p>
<p>Due to economic poverty in our country, the possibility of completely abolishing child labor is extremely small. Now, the main points of improving child labor are proposed for reference by those who care about the welfare of child labor: The authorities should prohibit children under the age of fourteen from working, and the work of children over the age of fourteen should not exceed half that of adults. Children who are physically weak or have diseases should not be allowed to work. The working hours should not exceed six hours. Implement factory inspections, and business owners who violate the provisions of the law should be severely punished. Establish charitable education, widely establish compulsory schools, so that the general poor children can enjoy the right to education. Establish children's libraries and other children's welfare undertakings, such as student loans, children's free hospitals, etc. Socially knowledgeable people should spread the weakness of the child labor system, so that capitalists will not harm the progress of the entire society because of petty greed, and employers should be made to cooperate with society.</p>
<p>In short, the improvement of the child labor system requires the voluntary promotion of capitalists. Otherwise, the future masters of the country will be forever cruelly destroyed!</p>
<h3>"Gentleman on the Beam" Premieres Early; "Gone With the Wind" Last Three Days</h3>
<p>The Kuguan Theater Troupe, with its strong strength and grand momentum, is holding a long-term charity performance for the student aid fund of this newspaper at the Paris Grand Theater. The first hit, "Gone With the Wind" ( "Gone With the Wind"), has achieved satisfactory results and will be discontinued on the 24th. Until today, there are only the last three days left.</p>
<p>The third charity performance of Kuguan, "Gentleman on the Beam," written and directed by Zuo Lin, consists of three acts and is a great farce. It is now scheduled to premiere nationwide on the night of the 26th of this month (Friday). These days, the backstage of the Paris Grand Theater is extremely tense due to the preparation of the new play, and this new play ("Gentleman on the Beam") is an extremely large scene that requires a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Mr. Zuo Lin is a specialist in directing who studied in England (in the Chinese theater industry, he can be called an expert director, but there are only two or three people). Several plays he directed in Shanghai in the past, such as "Metamorphosis," "Robinson Crusoe," "The Big Circus," and "The Trap," were all sensational for a while. Not only were they admired by the audience, but especially admired by experts. The success of "Gentleman on the Beam" can be imagined. Moreover, the lineup of actors this time is extremely neat. Ms. Danny, who has not appeared in "Gone With the Wind," plays an extremely important role in this play. Shi Yuan, Lin Bin, Bai Mu, etc., have few roles in "Gone With the Wind," and will all show their talents in "Gentleman on the Beam." Shi Hui plays a lawyer who loves to brag, and his personality is undoubtedly more suitable. They are well-matched, creating countless jokes scene after scene, which will give the audience a most pleasant laugh.</p>
<p>The cast of "Gentleman on the Beam" is as follows:</p>
<p>Actor Character Tu, Deputy Patrol Captain Qi Luo</p>
<p>Wang Rui Bai Mu Bao San Shi Yuan</p>
<p>Bai Menglan Wang Jun Mother Zhuang Yan</p>
<p>Ma Luxi Lin Zhen Police Officer A Tian Li</p>
<p>Ai Lan Lin Bin Police Officer B Le</p>
<p>Xia Pingkang Shi Hui Professor Chen Ping</p>

The situations were one-sided, and the scores were very far apart. In the A division, Huaying vs. Amateur Team, the film stars rushed back from Changzhou yesterday, despite fatigue, they immediately joined the battle. The amateur team Chen captain stood aside, losing his center of gravity, and the troops were hastily assembled, and the cooperation was not pure.

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>The Problem of "Convenient Delivery"</h3>
<p>Since the resumption of business of the China Merchants Securities Exchange under the order of the Ministry of Finance and Industry, our expectations for the Securities Exchange! Although we have not been able to say everything we want to say, we have said it many times. We have always said: "At this time of social and economic instability, the psychology of the people is mostly inclined to speculation: to seek that securities transactions are not the object of speculation at all may be impossible, but we hope that the government will strengthen its supervision, such as prohibiting futures transactions, such as restricting banks from using stocks as collateral, such as levying securities exchange taxes, all of which are remedies to prevent excessive speculation."</p>
<p>Regarding the "prohibition of futures transactions," at the beginning of the China Merchants Securities Exchange, it was stipulated that only spot transactions were allowed, and no futures trading was allowed at all. In other words, buyers would pay cash for goods, and sellers would take cash for stocks. If brokers engaged in speculative activities such as buying long and selling short, they would be sanctioned in accordance with the regulations once discovered. The original intention of preventing speculation has been clearly revealed. Now, the China Merchants Securities Exchange, in order to seek so-called convenience, has opened a seven-day "convenient delivery" transaction. This method, in order to use securities to make them flexible, may not be criticized, but what the securities market needs to prevent and avoid most is speculative trading of buying long and selling short. In the past, there were many speculators in physical transactions, causing trouble. Now that there are seven days of convenient delivery transactions, it is inevitable that those who short will use the seven days to move time to repeat their profitable tricks, causing the securities market to easily experience unstable fluctuations again. This must be paid close attention to. Based on the saying "preventing problems before they arise", it is best for the Securities Exchange not to "open the door to convenience" and implement the "convenient delivery" new system in an environment where the market is prone to fluctuations. Otherwise, it is necessary to refer to the successful methods of various countries in advance, formulate detailed rules, and not allow those who short to use this activity to shake the position of the securities market, which would be a greater loss than gain!</p>
<h3>"Spot Convenient Delivery" is Still Difficult to Achieve at Present, All Sectors Hope to Announce Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Regarding the previous rumor that the China Merchants Securities Exchange planned to "deliver in one week" for futures starting yesterday (22nd), all parties are paying close attention to it. It is recently learned that although the Securities Exchange authorities call this matter "spot convenient delivery", it is actually equivalent to opening a one-week delivery of futures. If they are not careful at the time of opening, they are easily manipulated by speculators, and the phenomenon of buying long and selling short occurs, which affects the entire stock market significantly. Therefore, they have to carefully plan before the trial shooting. Therefore, the statement that it will start yesterday is impossible.</p>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau Recovers Licenses Regarding the crackdown on off-exchange transactions of Chinese stocks, the reporter learned that some stock companies still act independently after the opening of the Securities Exchange and engage in off-exchange transactions. This is because these stock companies had previously obtained licenses issued by the Economic Bureau, allowing them to engage in transactions. Although the brokers have been re-verified after the resumption of the Securities Exchange, the licenses of the Municipal Economic Bureau have not been revoked. Therefore, those who hold licenses can continue their independent operations. It is recently learned that the Standing Committee of the Securities Exchange has contacted the Municipal Economic Bureau several times in order to achieve the crackdown on off-exchange transactions. As a result, the Economic Bureau has begun to recover the previously issued licenses. Therefore, off-exchange transactions can be eliminated within days.</p>
<p>Stock Market Conditions Must Be Announced</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of announcing stock market conditions, all parties are also extremely concerned about it. Currently, the market conditions within the Securities Exchange cannot be publicly published in the newspapers. Only a few brokers who can enter the market for transactions can know. All those with a little commercial knowledge will understand the disadvantages of this. Therefore, the Securities Exchange authorities and various industrial and commercial sectors hope that the relevant authorities can reconsider this issue and open it up as soon as possible so that those who buy and sell stocks can know the prices of each stock in detail in the newspapers so that stock brokers cannot easily manipulate them. This will be of great benefit to the stability of the stock market and the proper transaction.</p>
<h3>Uniform Endorsement Checks for All Banks and Firms</h3>
<p>Removing the words "or bearer"</p>
<p>For endorsement checks from banks and firms, if the words "or bearer" or "or holder" are formally crossed out, the receiving bank or firm must endorse and guarantee the check according to past practice. However, if the strokes of the name of the person to be paid are partially covered or the words "or bearer" are partially crossed out, it cannot be considered as crossed out. The Bankers Association has notified all banks and firms of this matter. Recently, some member banks believe that if the drawer covers the words "or bearer" with ink when issuing the check, it is considered crossed out by the drawer, but the banks regard it as not crossed out, which is contrary to the drawer's intention. It is difficult to distinguish whether the drawer did it intentionally or unintentionally. Therefore, a letter was sent to the Bankers Association for clarification. The association submitted it to the chairman's meeting for discussion. The main point is whether the numbers "or bearer" are completely crossed out or only partially covered. It is difficult to distinguish between intentional and unintentional. In order to unify the standards, it has been decided that for all endorsement checks, except for those that have completely formally crossed out the words "or bearer", those that have partially covered any one or two of them will not be considered as crossed out. All banks and firms should add a clause in their check regulations for future use, so that drawers know what to pay attention to.</p>
<h3>Candle Industry Group Refines Substitute Raw Materials</h3>
<p>The raw materials for candle manufacturing in this city have always been imported from overseas. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source has been cut off. In order to achieve local self-sufficiency, the relevant parties have been trying to refine substitute raw materials from vegetable oil, animal oil, and mineral oil so that the candle manufacturing industry can continue normally. It is recently learned that the Japanese Candle Industry Group, with Fuchang as the center, is massively purchasing and refining this kind of substitute raw material in various regions near the area. Ten thousand dan has been collected, so the supply of candle raw materials is expected to be partially resolved.</p>
<h3>Trends in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Securities Exchange has approved the request of various brokers to temporarily postpone the opening of convenient delivery transactions. However, people's hearts are still excited. Yesterday, stocks with small denominations continued to rise in the buying spree. Large denomination old stocks showed a trend of rising first and then falling back. This is because the seven-day convenient delivery was postponed, and buyers were less interested and instead sold off. According to the feelings of various parties, the trend is still mostly upward. The volume of transactions throughout the day was large. The movements of various stocks are recorded below.</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On Company opened quite high, then declined slightly, and then stabilized in the afternoon. Sincere was the most sluggish. National Goods rose by about one yuan.

Sanle Industrial has buyers at 60% of the face value and is still rising. Xinzhong Industrial, Zhongxing Zhenye also rose. Guohua Investment was firm. The wind of Baoan Glass also rose, and the buying price has been raised to 25% of the face value. Most of the remaining stocks are tighter than last week.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday, it turned weak again and continued to fluctuate. The rise and fall of public prices has almost been confined to a certain range. The previous highest price has not been broken through, and the previous lowest price has not been hit. Therefore, those engaged in this industry are gradually feeling bored. Only a small part of those who still have many long and short positions have settled. Yesterday, the market for Type C opened well, and then gradually declined. There were few twists and turns, and buyers were rare. The final price at noon fell significantly compared with last weekend. Types A, B, D, and E all saw declines. The market for miscellaneous brands has been fluctuating inside and outside the pass.</p>
<p>Call Loan Interest Rate: Yesterday, the Bankers Association's call loan interest rate was 1.7%, which has not changed.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Match soap, because both domestic and foreign sales are sluggish, the market is stable and there is no change from last Saturday. The stock of foreign soap is increasingly scarce, and transactions have stagnated.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: The cigarette market was generally sluggish compared to last weekend. Today, because there are inquiries from customers, the price has continued to rise.

<p>Southern Goods: Dried longan, lychee, and other miscellaneous goods mostly rely on drums. In the past, transportation between Zhangzhou and drums was intermittent, and there was no arrival for a long time. According to customer information, the freight rate at the source has increased by several hundred yuan, and the exchange rate has also shrunk, and the cost is still rising. However, the Shanghai market is weakening due to reduced inventory. In addition, the mooncakes have been lacking in arrival for a long time, and most of the inventory is of poor quality. Yesterday, it was heard that hundreds of pieces have arrived, and according to information, the goods are good and should meet the standards.</p>

<h3>Speech by Department Chief Matsushima (Translated from the Second Edition)</h3>
<p>In the meantime, Chongqing repeatedly sought help from the British forces in eastern India, but they remained coldly indifferent, which gradually aroused great resentment among the Chongqing troops. Based on this fact alone, one can clearly understand the true intentions of the British and Americans. They only use East Asian peoples when it suits them. Once it's disadvantageous, they ignore them. This is very obvious. No, they are like this even among allies. Just like during the Dunkirk defeat, the British army sacrificed the allied Dutch and Belgian forces to quickly escape back to their home country. Furthermore, officers and above were even rewarded for their skillful retreat. No, furthermore, even within the same country's armed forces, the navy and the army or air force are constantly fighting. This is also something that cannot be forgotten. The Chongqing army disregards past history and the nature of the British and Americans, stubbornly cooperating with them, stubbornly digging their own grave. It is truly pathetic. Resistance in the direction of Burma faces the many difficulties mentioned above. On land, our elite army units continue their undefeated deployment. At the same time, when necessary, the elite of the navy can cover the sea and air to annihilate attacking forces. Therefore, their attacks will ultimately hasten the early demise of the British and Americans themselves. It is even easier to judge that the Chongqing army, in particular, will be placed in the most miserable fate.</p>
<p>Of course, based on the progression of the war, some of the British and American fleets or part of the troops in North Africa will move towards India. But this is not worth worrying about at all. We believe that the enemy sees the Mediterranean and the seas of Greater East Asia as being in completely different environments. This will soon become clear. Even if the British and American forces' maneuvers in the Mediterranean, which is practically devoid of naval power, may be very easy, it should be understood that the terrain of India and Burma and the existence of our navy are completely different from their situation. Moreover, just like the recent naval air battle off Bougainville Island, we can easily shatter the enemy's battleships and aircraft carriers into layers on the seabed with just a few naval aircraft. Judging from this, no matter what kind of fleet they send, we should actually celebrate.</p>
<p>Secondly, our forces in the New Guinea area, after transferring from some bases to strategic key points, the enemy attacked the Finschhafen area from the north. A fierce land battle unfolded, echoing the air war. Remarkable results are developing. We believe that the enemy's plan is probably to break through the Philippine Islands from the center of New Guinea, or our important resource production areas in the East Indies. However, as soon as the British and Americans approach us, the outcome of their fate can be immediately determined.</p>
<p>In the Banda Sea area, enemy planes often come to invade, but each time they fail to achieve any results and suffer great losses before retreating.</p>
<p>Next, regarding the China front, recently the American air force in China (the Fourteenth Air Force) has often appeared over the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and in South China, conducting blind bombing or machine-gun strafing. However, the damage they inflict on innocent Chinese civilians is dozens of times greater than the damage suffered by our military facilities. This has been repeatedly reported in newspapers. Recently, Chongqing senators Zhang Zhongren and Leng [blank] and others contacted influential figures in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces regarding the actions of the American air force against Chinese civilians, and submitted a petition to Chongqing. There are facts about Chongqing detaining this petition.</p>
<p>According to the British government's announcement on the 5th, Wyatt was recently appointed as a special military representative stationed in Chongqing, and Churchill and the Supreme Commander of Southeast Asia, Mountbatten. Regardless of who they appoint, in short, we cannot allow the existence of the British and American forces who indiscriminately oppress the territory and people of China without reason.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the propaganda of the British and Americans. The propaganda of the British and Americans is always absurd. Compared to Chongqing's exaggeration of "three thousand feet of white hair," it is even more skillful. You all know this very clearly because you are in charge of this kind of thing. In particular, in order to deceive their own people regarding the recent war situation in the Pacific, they have reported many shockingly fictitious facts. Ever since the results of our navy's victory in the air battle of Bougainville Island were announced, the world has been shocked by the power of our naval aircraft. After receiving this report, US Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters that this was completely fictitious. But in fact, since the naval battle of Mono Island on October 27, in just fourteen days, we have established a record of sinking or destroying 77 ships or more, from battleships and aircraft carriers to large cruisers, and shooting down or destroying more than 530 aircraft. Yet the US Navy continues to make small-scale announcements as usual, saying that they have lost three destroyers in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is very doubtful how long this kind of deception of the people can continue. In this war, at least 10,000 American soldiers have fallen. If things are like this, there is simply no possibility of success. We feel great sympathy for the families of these soldiers.</p>
<p>However, the event that can clearly demonstrate the facts is that after our headquarters announced it, President Roosevelt immediately summoned Joint Fleet Commander King and Chief of Staff Marshall and Air Force Commander Arnold to the White House. We don't know why they held an emergency summit. Their agitation is truly difficult to conceal. People in the American government and public are monitoring this unclear secret of the White House, waiting for it to be exposed in broad daylight. At the same time, it is said that the American officers' families are also urging the authorities to release the truth.</p>
<p>The British and Americans, while heartlessly doing untruthful things, extend their unreasonable desires. After all, their true intention is to control the world based on individualistic ideas. No justice or humanity can be found anywhere in their actions. They have used deception and co-option for a long time to monopolize the world's wealth and prosperity. They are about to have their masks torn off and exposed in the broad daylight. To tear this apart, to crush this, to enable the world to practice the justice of heaven and earth, this is the true spirit of building Greater East Asia. All of this is included in the five articles of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration announced to the world at this Greater East Asia Conference. From any point of view, these five principles are not as self-serving, monopolistic, and exclusive as the Monroe Doctrine. They respect themselves, and at the same time, with family-like kinship, they are building a paradise ruled by benevolence and righteousness in Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>This great spirit has been condensed from the sincerity of Japan since its founding. It has been accomplished in this era and has been embodied. This is a point recognized by the representatives of all countries participating in the Greater East Asia Conference. In order to carry out this spirit, the Greater East Asia War was launched. For a long time, under the shackles of the British and Americans, ignoring God-given freedom and independence, we have walked a path of obscurity. All our friendly nations can rise up suddenly and fight for the liberation of Asia and for the independence of Asia. What a noble war this is. The spirits of our ancestors in heaven are pleased. Heaven is watching us. Our descendants have entrusted the fate of our rise and fall to us now, and are waiting for the outcome of the war. When the war is successful, what will be realized in Greater East Asia will be the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss where heavenly flowers shine in the three thousand great thousand worlds. When the war is defeated, what will be left is the desolate East Asian landscape that has already died.</p>
<p>Will the British and Americans, who intend to conquer and oppress the peoples of Greater East Asia and turn them into colonies, win, or will the war for Greater East Asia, where all nations coexist and prosper, win? The advantage of heaven has already been illuminated by the gods. To combine the advantage of location and the harmony of people to win the final victory is the responsibility of the Greater East Asian people from now on. The Greater East Asia War is the war of the Greater East Asian people. Countries other than Japan and China must not be considered third parties.</p>
<p>Just as I was starting this article, the good news of the fourth naval battle of Bougainville Island arrived. No, no matter how many wars there are in the future, our victory must be carried through to the end. Victory is not only the responsibility of Japan. It must become the responsibility and belief of China and the other countries of Greater East Asia. You, every time we hear the battle situation from the front lines, we feel painfully that the enemy is also continuing to wage desperate battles. The brave and valiant battles of Germany in Western Europe will surely echo the victories in the Pacific and achieve their final goal.</p>
<p>Why are we still talking about how, during the Three-Power Conference, we responded to the Four-Power Declaration? It is because our inevitable iron fire and the raging fire of the Greater East Asian national spirit will burn everything to ashes. This flame of justice is now burning fiercely in the hearts of a billion Asian people. This flame of the soul obscures the sky, and the day of the British and American allied forces descending [blank] is gradually approaching.</p>
<p>At this time, the Kuomintang government held a propaganda conference to convey this great righteousness to the world's nations, which is truly of great significance.</p>
<p>In order to establish justice that shines on the world, Japan and China must not regard any suffering as suffering, but must move forward on the path of selfless progress as the center of Greater East Asia. Thank you for listening. (The End)</p>

<h3>Northwest Wind Howls as Readers Eagerly Donate Winter Clothing, Passionate Sympathy Repels the Cold</h3>
<p>In recent days, the northwest wind has been howling, as if it were mid-winter, and it is even colder at night. The beggars and [blank] on the streets are suffering from hunger and cold, moaning and waiting for death, which is a very miserable sight. Yesterday, thanks to readers who were moved by sympathy, many voluntarily came to donate money. Builder Wang [blank] Sun wrote: "The cotton clothing tickets I promised to donate are of a charitable nature and should not be refused. Moreover, in this unusually cold weather, relief should be provided urgently. However, people's hearts are not as they used to be, and the clothes are shoddy and not worth the donated amount. Therefore, it goes against my previous wish, and I dare not delay any longer. I am now sending 5,000 yuan in national currency to be used as a winter clothing donation in accordance with your method, to do my small part." Also, an anonymous Mr. Xia generously donated 2,000 yuan. De Si Kee trusts the integrity of this newspaper's service and personally delivered 1,000 yuan. Here is a report of the donations from various circles yesterday:</p>
<p>Wang [blank] Sun, 5,000 yuan; Mr. Xia, 2,000 yuan; De Si Kee, 1,000 yuan; Jinshoutang, 100 yuan; Hong Cheng [blank], 100 yuan; Chen Fufan, 50 yuan; Fang Zhongkang, 30 yuan; Xie Zenghui, 30 yuan; anonymous, Mr. Li, 20 yuan each; Tu Yongqing, Tu Wan, Sun Zhang's old lady, Mr. Yu, Mr. Ye, 10 yuan each. Total: 8,400 yuan.</p>
<p>Health Association Responds to Teachers' Medical Aid Fund</p>
<p>The Shanghai Health Association wrote: "Recently, the medical problem has become increasingly serious. If wage earners unfortunately fall ill, they feel overwhelmed by the burden. The association is supported by enthusiastic people from a society who donate medical aid funds to provide free diagnosis and treatment for those who are economically disadvantaged. For valuable medicines, a loan system is used to serve the public, so that the aid funds can flow continuously and inexhaustibly. Furthermore, the charitable act of medical relief for primary school teachers organized by your newspaper is widely beneficial, and our association should participate in response, to fulfill our medical duties and express our sincerity to teachers." (Address: 587 Jing'an Temple Road)</p>
<p>Ding Fu Lao Benefits Teachers</p>
<p>Your newspaper spares no effort in helping primary school teachers get free medical treatment. I, Fu Bao, was also weak and ill 40 years ago. Later, I used various natural therapies to become healthy and strong. I know a little about conditioning, and now, in order to serve society, any primary school teacher who suffers from malnutrition, anemia, qi deficiency, or neurasthenia, or has internal organ problems, or does not respond to injections or medication, please go to the Shen Bao office to obtain a medical examination voucher and come to my clinic. Perhaps they can be cured without medicine, using my health and longevity method. If they are determined and persevering, they will surely achieve the goal of preventing illness and staying healthy, without a doubt. Ding Yi Fu Bao respectfully</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical Service Society Starts Next Month</p>

Recently, the eighth district branch society was being prepared by Jian Renmin, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Social Welfare. The address of the branch society is located at 742 Huangshan Road (formerly Rue du Pere Froc) at the intersection of Daxing Road (formerly Avenue Lafayette). It is said that it will start service early next month.</p>
