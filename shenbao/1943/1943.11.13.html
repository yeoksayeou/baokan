<h3>追念一位　報界先進</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>本報故總經理史量才先生在京杭國道慘遭暗殺，已經整整的九年了。史先生之死於非命，不僅是本報，而且是中國新聞界一大損失，這是毫無疑問的。然而，史先生辦報的精神和服務人羣社會的熱心，至今還留在千萬人的心目中，值得我們追念，值得我們誠勉。</p>
<p>史先生早歲研習理化，愛好科學，自兼任時報主筆後，開始對新聞事業感覺興趣，民國二年接辦本報，即以辦報為終身事業，慘澹經營，二十餘年，未嘗稍懈，所以說今日之本報，皆為史先生一生心血之所凝結，實在不為過譽。史先生對於中國新聞事業，雖然沒有什麼驚天動地的大貢獻，然而在使報紙趨向於現代化一點，確實值得讚譽。特別是在本報舉行六十週年紀念後，銳意擴張附屬事業，如延聘專家，編製全國地圖，精美詳確，為各界歡迎。如創設補習學校，流通圖書館；出版年鑑，月刊等等，為文化事業全面努力。然面史先生從未表示自滿，不斷求　業的改進。雖然他的成就，與先進各國的新聞事業比較，依然落後，而且遠未達到預期的理想，不過這種銳意前進的精神，在我國新聞界實在是難得看到的！</p>
<p>我國現代化的新聞事業。還在萌芽時代，而我國複雜的政治和社會環境，叉處處為這幼稚的新聞事業安設着許多陷阱，屈之以威武，淫之以富貴，移之以貧賤，無所不至。我們在道裹更不禁懷念史先生。當民國初年，袁項城蓄意盜國，會謀以銀彈壓服全國與論，本報亦為其脅誘目標之一。是時先生初主本報，即直却之。其後軍閥當國者十年，先生貞介自潔，婉約自全，保全報格，也因此使本報永達為不受任何方面之津貼，而保持其民衆喉舌的超然地位，可是，其間會費却幾許苦心，幾許頓挫啊！</p>
<p>史先生主辦本報，埋頭苦幹，專志不騖，自民國二十年後，對國家社會事業，愈益重視。先生會說：「報館之責，在辦明是非，是非茍稍顛倒，即罪孽也；報館之責，在提倡公道，公道苟不伸張，即罪孽也；國家賴輿論以匡救，苟稍失職，即罪孽也，社會賴與論以改進，苟稍不力，即罪孽也；他若貧民之如何救濟，水旱天災之如何防救，苟不熱心倡導，盡力設法　，亦即罪孽也。報紙之威權愈大，則其所造之罪孽亦愈大。因想在社會上做些文化建設等事業。」後來，他對於社會地方事業，熱心推進，不遺餘力，並創辦難民救濟協會等，參加慈善救濟工作。不只是坐而言，並且起而行了。</p>
<p>綜觀史先生畢生行狀，為了辦報，為了啟迪人文，為了服務社會，固然听夕不邊，心力交瘁，然而對於政洽，除了因為不滿現狀而進諍言以外，決無任何企圖，不會反對政府，更不會有任何反政府的行動。這是誰都不能否認的事實。不幸竟被初創時期的藍衣社份子所殘害，誠令天下仁人志士為之痛悼與寒心！然以史先生加此穩健有為之士而竟遭非命之死，亦可見藍衣社情報之不確與特務制度之危險。吾人今日追念報界先進，猶不禁為之震慟！</p>

<h3>特戈爾武力干涉　黎巴嫩內政　總統總理被逮捕</h3>

<p>安加拉十二日中央社電　據開羅息：埃及總理那哈斯星期三延見阿爾及爾委員會之駐中東代表，嚴　抗議特戈爾派當局在黎巴嫩所採取之措施。渠曾提及　特魯將軍曾保證黎巴嫩問題將以合理及公平之方法解決，阿及爾委員會現時之態度，即違反此項保證英國及法國曾允許叙利亞及黎巴嫩獨立，而法國對叙利亞之代營即因此而取消，所云在法國未將代管權正式返還國雖之前仍為代管國之說實屬不通，國際聯盟業已停止工作，叙利亞及黎巴嫩決不能等待改組後之國聯正式批准英法之承認叙利亞獨立。</p>

<p>國民論壇</p>
<h3>談談今後之華歐洲共同市場市塲</h3>
<p>— 少</p>
<p>華商證券交易所之正式復業，無疑的該是主管當局澈底整頓華股市塲之初步事實表示。今後之合理運營如何切實推進，以及過去積弊之如何肅淸，此均為華商證券交易所今後之主要責任。亦毋須第三者之喋喋也。惟値此證交卽將正式營業之際，我人本愛護民族資本投資市塲之忱，願以國民立塲，貢其管見之所及　　交當局及邦人君子共檢討焉。</p>
<p>一，賣買之方式—華股市地目前之賣買方式，頗為一般人所詬病。且其影響所及，眞正之投資人　足不前，一般投機家乃視為利　，而一般股票經紀商且，此收入甚巨之不當利得也。股票經紀人按照規定，其本身不能為股票之賣買、僅接受客戶之委託而為賣買行為而已。惟目前情形則一般股票經紀人，均水身直接為賣買。例如，股票持有人某甲於需用現欵而出賣共殷票時，並不由股票公司代北尋覓承受人，而自己本身即於　低其資價後，而為承受之買方。反之，如委託股票公司購進股票時，股票公司即以於之市價之價格虛售與購買人。然後再低價補進其虛售額，此種情形即市塲中所謂之「浮多」「浮空」。與」多參空對支」此種不合理而且為越規的賣買方式之存在，實在使股票市場時常掀起許多不必要的波動。而這種波。的掀起，并往由公司即　（卽股票經紀商（作中心。而且由其他同業推廣開去。而且正式的成交市價給股票公司羣蔽住了。他們且各自　掛不同的賣買價格。而賣價與買　問的差額，又是甚臣！如十元票而　的股票，共市價有十一二元的，而股票公司所標的賣買價一差頭，究有一二元之巨，實堪驚人！於是，流風所至，一般股票公司窺以低佣號召客戶，而另一面，「遂其」揩油」「剝削」實。尤其，遺搖操縱也風起雲湧了！一般人之理印象亦遂視華股布塲形同變相之賭場了。所以，過往華股市之　設，未能完成它吸收投資者，大部控制游約任務，反為許多投機家聞關了一個樂園！</p>
<p>今後，交正式復業　拍，其賣買方式，吾人務希避免目前之缺陷，廢止「繼續賣買」採用「爭資買」之方式，以杜紀商非法油之門，而收價格劃一之效。</p>
<p>範亦範圍嚴加厚訂，如規定每日漲跌範圍不得超過市值百分之機，藉免華股賣買有過份趨向投機化之危險。股票經經人本身麥典賣買交易之限治典取締，固尤為要謂也</p>
<p>二，股票經紀人之資格股票經紀人之資格，務須審核嚴密，青少而精，而勿多而雜！目前傳聞中證交復業後，將有經紀人二百之數，此數於事實上如嫌過多，設額多而復求質精，誠頗不易易！抑中低佣金收戶等，僅共小者。即對於經紀商本身，亦有分散舉務之弊。而况數額過多一交本亦將不易妥善管理也。</p>
<p>股票經紀人之資格除且有股實之信用，資材、及充足之經以外進步審核其股東的價用與股歷設有政府官或政府官史之關係人參共間，則應否定其紀資格，絕對不徇情，不包庇。史商，本於禁例，惟事買上，在目前尚未能澈底到。有官史本身並不出面參加，而由其親屬友朋等為代表，一時雖不易察，惟證交當局，務須時派員探查，而一經發後，更須立即停止其起紀人業務吾人忪於戰前之布交易所風，故不得不盼常局令證予考核，使手續稍稍麻煩而不使成投機潮，重苦民生也。</p>
<p>三，上市股票之審查依照目前證交所宜佈之審查原以觀，可謂大體上已頗詳盡而嚴格。惟對於上市股票之企業，「須有一年以上歷史」一點，一經透論列，共觀點與　者之觀點同，即，凡有詳盡正確之營柴計劃，一而共企之營直接間一接有利於計　者，一雖新設之企業，亦應允，對於計民並無著之利者。或經營方法不良，技術後不合戰經紀之「效率「準者，一或無正確之營計劃者：一或並不　事生產絨僅吸　股金作為投機關積者；或生產工作停頓相當時期以上而尚未復業者，等則雖具有一年以上之歷史，亦無九准各該股上市買之理由也於此，人盼交員當局，能時將此項原則加以活用，未上市者時接受上市謂而予合理之審核一葱詳細復核，是否可以經四，增資的限制興許可為求投人的安金辦保，對於上市股票的資，不得不予以當的理。一方面於澈底查明一必須資的切實理由以移一，始予許可。一方面嚴限制其增資　，不德超過事實上之需要。我們相信，此種巖格管理之實施，至少可以避免　水股票上塲，而至影投資認對於股票的信仰，股票價格有利的穩定、當然也可斬致之了。</p>
<p>實在，目前許多工商企業的增資方式，太使我們的縣成旗為大的這麼了。例如，菜一企業於一年前創立，其資本為一百萬元，迄今雖營業並無因良成績，而其生產設　因物價高漲及幣值低落之一致重關係，寬值市價一千萬元。即一般人所謂已經賺進九百萬元。於是，企業　者，雖尚狂沖充經之正確計劃與把握，亦以「送股」為號召，股東一未得實利之前，先行再付出其價資股，如送是，一周物價有劇烈屬助而下之時，則企業本之損失，即由股東全担也反之，亦僅供介水身於收集股之新股款後，作集中之原料積與設備資材之，遂不正當之營業企而至於若干介業之純　「送股的價資」。則除去納說義務之企圖及吸引　機家之注目外，　無共飾理由及增益其本身愛業效果吧。</p>
<p>總之，現在還是「非常時期」，物價比值還沒有得到最合理的穩定，任何企業因暫時設關，原料等增值之關係而」增資」（實際上實在是分紅）時，防宜特別實　也。交當局於切實而巖格執行其監督。管理之職資外，更應公開予一般人以投資之正確指導如聘聘請家及公正人士，組織調查統計之專門機構，定期公佈其調查統計之資　與結論正尊引　資流集於最有利於國計民生的企業，最有利於投資的最優　企業。徨無門的苦　　資，既可大部得到合理的歸　，即目創尚購兩物資的頭寸，亦可遂於來集了。地完滿完成，該是當局戰之產業新興與國族復興了。</p>

<h3>江灣荒地</h3>
<p>最近，本市糧食局會據中團發　公司代表呈請承領軍工路，虹鎭，天實路，江濤　馬廳外　，楊　浦路荒地四役，實行鑒　，以資增產，當經該局派員查明共中屬於江灣跑馬廳外園幾段，既屬荒地，核與書勵懇荒暫行條例相符，業已公吿江處荒地業主注意。我們感覺江濤荒地，雖非廣土，然其於「聚沙成塔，集腋成裘」的意義，則利用都市外圍的每一塊荒地，加以墾殖，使共對於都市食糧以及菜蔬之供應，有着相當的補助，亦未始不是增產運動中所不容忽視的一點。</p>
<p>本年六月問，我們會以「俄京市民屬辦」為題，論反俄京莫斯科從事於市民農團之開閣，把郊外通至市中的道路及市街，分關為處園土地，從事耕作，以期補救糧食恐慌於萬一，認為是切合現實需要的一個良法美意；今日「俄京市內到處可見的市民農面，大小多至三萬三千二百四十九所以上。』假令上海能以墾殖江濤荒地一舉為其發軔點；籍極地並且普遍地從事於上海市四郊所有荒地的開關，使其成為廣大的農團，環　着五百萬市民待哺的都市，共有裨於上海食糧典菜蔬之供應，自不待嘗了。深望市政當局，聯合地方糧政機關，以及社會福利　體，羣策羣力，共同提倡，那末，未來的上海市郊農圃，也能媲美俄京的市民園圃，同樣地得有所貨獻於戰爭中的市民生活。</p>

<h3>Remembering a Pioneer in Journalism</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>It has been a full nine years since Mr. Shi Liangcai, the late General Manager of this newspaper, was tragically assassinated on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. Mr. Shi's untimely death was undoubtedly a great loss not only for this newspaper but also for the Chinese journalism world. However, Mr. Shi's spirit of running the newspaper and his enthusiasm for serving the people and society still remain in the hearts of millions, worthy of our remembrance and encouragement.</p>
<p>In his early years, Mr. Shi studied physics and chemistry, with a love of science. After concurrently serving as the chief writer of the Shibao newspaper, he began to feel interested in the newspaper business. In the second year of the Republic of China, he took over this newspaper and made running the newspaper his lifelong career, working diligently for more than twenty years without the slightest懈怠. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that today's newspaper is the crystallization of Mr. Shi's life's efforts. Although Mr. Shi did not make any earth-shattering contributions to the Chinese journalism industry, he certainly deserves praise for his efforts to modernize newspapers. Especially after this newspaper held its 60th-anniversary celebration, he was determined to expand affiliated businesses, such as hiring experts to compile a national map, which was exquisite, detailed, and welcomed by all sectors. He also founded tutorial schools and circulating libraries, and published yearbooks, monthly magazines, and so on, making comprehensive efforts for cultural undertakings. However, Mr. Shi never expressed complacency and constantly sought improvement in his work. Although his achievements still lagged behind the advanced journalism industries of various countries, and he was far from reaching his expected ideals, this spirit of striving forward was indeed rare in the Chinese journalism world!</p>
<p>China's modernized journalism industry is still in its infancy, and China's complex political and social environment is setting many traps for this young journalism industry, threatening it with force, seducing it with wealth, and moving it with poverty, using every possible means. We can't help but miss Mr. Shi even more in this way. In the early years of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai intentionally stole the country and plotted to use silver bullets to subdue national opinion. This newspaper was also one of his targets of coercion and inducement. At that time, Mr. Shi had just taken charge of this newspaper and rejected it directly. In the ten years that followed, when warlords were in power, Mr. Shi was upright, self-cleansing, gentle, and self-preserving, protecting the integrity of the newspaper. This also enabled this newspaper to always be free from subsidies from any party and maintain its detached position as the voice of the people. However, how much effort and frustration it took during that time!</p>
<p>Mr. Shi presided over this newspaper, burying himself in hard work, focusing on his ambition. Since the 20th year of the Republic of China, he has paid more and more attention to national and social undertakings. Mr. Shi once said: "The responsibility of a newspaper is to clarify right and wrong. If right and wrong are slightly reversed, it is a sin. The responsibility of a newspaper is to promote justice. If justice is not upheld, it is a sin. The country relies on public opinion for correction. If it is slightly derelict in its duty, it is a sin. Society relies on public opinion for improvement. If it is slightly weak, it is a sin. As for how to help the poor and how to prevent and rescue from floods and droughts, if we do not enthusiastically advocate and make every effort to do so, it is also a sin. The greater the authority of a newspaper, the greater the sins it can create. Therefore, I want to do some cultural construction and other undertakings in society." Later, he enthusiastically promoted social and local undertakings, spared no effort, and founded the Refugee Relief Association, participating in charitable relief work. He not only spoke but also acted.</p>
<p>Looking at Mr. Shi's life, for the sake of running the newspaper, for the sake of enlightening people, and for the sake of serving society, he worked tirelessly and exhausted his energy. However, regarding politics, except for offering sincere advice because of dissatisfaction with the status quo, he had no other intentions. He would not oppose the government, let alone take any anti-government actions. This is an undeniable fact. Unfortunately, he was harmed by members of the Blue Shirts Society in its early stages, which truly caused grief and dismay among people of conscience and integrity in the world! However, the fact that Mr. Shi, a man of such prudence and accomplishment, died an unnatural death also shows the inaccuracy of the Blue Shirts Society's intelligence and the danger of the special agent system. Today, as we remember the pioneer of the journalism world, we cannot help but feel shocked and saddened!</p>

<h3>Reading the Memorial Text</h3>
<p>Here is the memorial text for realizing the Founding Father's will, recorded on November 12, 32nd year of the Republic of China, which is the 78th birthday of our Founding Father. Disciples Wang Zhaoming and others hereby inform our Founding Father in heaven. Before our Founding Father passed away, he delivered a lecture on pan-Asianism in Kobe, Japan, and hoped that Japan would assist China in abolishing unequal treaties. When our Founding Father was on his deathbed, he earnestly reminded us that the revolution had not yet succeeded and instructed us comrades to continue our efforts. Since receiving the order, the disciples have been cautious day and night, fearing that they would not be able to succeed. Now, fortunately, with the assistance of Japan, an agreement was concluded on the 9th of this year, advancing the handover and abolishing extraterritoriality. In August, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was signed on the 2nd. The Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty and its subsidiary documents, stipulated on November 10, 19 years ago, are all invalid. On November 5, Japan initiated the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo. Representatives from various East Asian countries attended, and representatives from the Provisional Government of Free India also attended. On the 6th, the Greater East Asia Declaration was resolved and published. Our Founding Father's hope that Japan would assist China in abolishing unequal treaties has been realized today, and pan-Asianism has begun to be implemented. May our Founding Father in heaven have mercy on the foolishness of the disciples, bestow guidance and encouragement, enlighten the disciples in Chongqing to awaken and return soon, complete unification, revitalize together, gather the hearts and resources of the whole country, and strive together with allied countries to complete the Greater East Asia War and the successful construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The disciples vow to do everything possible to carry out the will, and we will not hesitate to die for it. May our Founding Father in heaven witness this.</p>

The area is a military base used by enemy forces in the central region of the India-Burma battle area. The British Indian Army used the area as a center, with a large number of aircraft based in the attached zone. The area was equipped with Hurricane fighters and had become an aerial guerrilla warfare base. Recently, the enemy forces have been loudly calling for a counteroffensive against Burma, with the establishment of certain military headquarters. It is structured as a first line resupply base. In this attack, the enemy's aviation guerilla warfare forces and ground operation areas were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) An unnamed base in the South Pacific, 12th report, Japanese forces are currently engaged in fierce air combat around the Solomon Islands. Enemy aircraft have also bombed New Guinea, and Japanese troops stationed there are fighting day and night.

<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - During the Sino-Japanese Student Joint Sports Meet on the 12th, Chairman Wang addressed the Chinese and Japanese students. The original text of the speech is as follows:</p>
<p>I am very pleased to participate in the Nanjing Municipal Middle and Primary School Joint Sports Meet today.</p>
<p>China and Japan are brotherly nations. Since the Greater East Asia War, the two countries have been standing on the same line of security and sharing the same destiny. The people of both countries are also standing on the same line of sharing weal and woe. Therefore, it is even more necessary for the people of both countries to unite. Unity requires mutual love and mutual encouragement to seek progress. Sports meets are a good venue for mutual love and mutual encouragement to seek progress. I hope that everyone not only focuses on physical strength and skills, but also pays special attention to moral character.</p>
<p>Japan is an advanced country, not only in sports but in everything else. China must strive to catch up in order to stand on the same front line with Japan.</p>
<p>On the 7th of this month, I visited the National Training Conference in front of the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, and one feature impressed me deeply. First, it emphasizes physical training, not just personal competition. Second, it has a fighting spirit, which is the spirit that the general public should have during the Greater East Asia War. Third, during the exercise, everyone shouted the slogan of national exercise. Not only the athletes but also the tens of thousands of spectators at the venue, regardless of gender or age, exercised together. This kind of popular spirit is really admirable. I think all sports meets should follow this model, especially in China.</p>
<p>Today is the birthday of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China. Holding the sports meet today is particularly meaningful. I would like to offer a small wish to the conference: may the brothers of East Asia be healthy and progress. (Attached) The Chairman greatly admired the fact that the male and female students all ran barefoot during the sports meet, saying that this was only possible with daily training. He said that Chinese male and female students should take this as an example. He also greatly admired a Chinese male student who performed very well, saying that it saved trouble to have his hair cut short. None of the Japanese male students had long hair either.</p>
<h3>Japanese Resident Army in China Announces One Week of War Situation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Resident Army in China announced on November 12th the war situation for the past week, stating that since November 2nd, the Japanese and Chinese Expeditionary Forces have launched offensive operations in the area west of Dongting Lake, attacking the Chongqing troops everywhere and expanding the results of the battle. The Japanese army, under the urgent pressure of annihilating the remaining enemy forces, began operations, attacking the Chongqing troops who relied on strong positions to attempt counterattacks, including the Provisional 194th Division, the 6th Division, the 180th Division, and the 112th Division. They pursued the fleeing enemy and, by the 7th, occupied important strongholds of the Chongqing troops, including Sangxi Temple, Shanlin Temple, Nanxian, Anxiang, Lahekou, Dayandang, Chayuansi, Sizhai, Nuanshui Street, Pianshan River, Xianxiao Meixi Temple and other places. They are currently pursuing and suppressing the retreating Chongqing troops and are approaching the largest strongholds of the Chongqing troops, such as Jinshi, Lixian, Hekou, and Xinan. Since the beginning of this operation, the Chongqing troops have suffered heavy losses due to the underestimation of their military strength. The Chongqing troops are now making every effort to defend themselves, and their situation is extremely embarrassing. On the same day, the Japanese army air force, working with the ground forces, launched a large-scale surprise attack on the front-line air base of the Chongqing troops on the 2nd, using bomber formations, destroying runways, oil depots, and military facilities, achieving great results and crushing the Chongqing troops' attempt to stir up trouble.</p>
<h3>Britain is Deeply Wary of the Indian National Army</h3>
<p>Yangon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from New Delhi: The Indian National Army, initiated by Chandra Bose, has already infiltrated the Delhi area and become a major threat. It is also a threat to the British who are suffering from the oppression of the British and the Vietnamese. Although the authorities are trying to cover up the situation, it is feared that an even bigger incident will occur. However, Britain has already stepped up its efforts to suppress it. The government has responded by reorganizing the Indian customs and imposing military law. The Indian National Army is receiving subsidies from its allies. From this, it can be seen that Britain is deeply wary of the Indian National Army.</p>

The meeting began with an opening speech by Kusano, Director-General of the Guidance Council. Then, Japanese Youth League President Suzuki Kantaro, General Daiya, and other representatives gave speeches, and guests sent messages. At 11:00 AM, the opening ceremony concluded, and the group immediately went to the Imperial Palace for remote worship and visited the Meiji Shrine and Yasukuni Shrine. At the same time, they swore an oath before the gods to destroy the enemies of Asia, England and the United States, and to stand on the front line of decisive battles and strengthen combat capabilities, and to unite the youth of Greater East Asia. From the 13th, a general meeting was held in the conference hall of the hall to continue the meeting, mutually discuss the draft of the Greater East Asia Youth Association's rules proposed by the Japanese youth, and the case of the alliance between the youth of various countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere jointly proposed by China, Japan, and Manchuria. The first day of the meeting then concluded.</p>
<p>Summary of Mr. Lin Baisheng's Speech</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - At the Greater East Asia Youth Leaders Conference held on the 12th at the Japan Youth Hall, Mr. Lin Baisheng, the leader of the Chinese Youth League, stood up and delivered a speech. The main points are as follows: First, at the time of the Greater East Asia Youth Leaders Conference, it is very gratifying that the Japanese army has continued to achieve great victories. The brave and well-trained spirit of the Southern Army is worth emulating. If the enemy has this spirit, then no matter what strategy or tactics the enemy uses, they will not succeed. Today is the anniversary of the birth of our Father Sun Yat-sen, and grand celebrations are being held in various parts of China. We were unable to personally attend the sacrifices because we were attending the Youth Graduation Ceremony. This conference is limited to representatives from China and Manchuria. Many ethnic groups in the Greater East Asia region and the South, as well as the one-tenth of the East Asian population, the Indian compatriots, are still under British rule and have not yet obtained freedom. I hope that in the near future, we can work together with our Indian compatriots to rebuild East Asia.</p>
<p>The Significance of the Northern Asia Conference is Profound</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Chinese, Japanese, and Manchurian youth, in order to climb to the same goal to defeat the United States and Britain, to build a new order of East Asia based on righteousness, to adhere to the covenant, and to strive to complete their common goals, and to strengthen their resolve, held this conference, which is of great significance. The various groups in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere should respect each other's independence and promote their amity. In particular, they should understand each other's rationality. The so-called understanding of the other party is to recognize its natural attitude as a starting point, and the reason for the natural attitude must be implemented from the youth era. Therefore, this conference is of great significance for representatives of the youth leagues of the three countries to meet together and discuss.</p>
<h3>Eden Reports to the House of Commons on the Outcome of the Three-Nation Conference, Explaining the Two Major Goals of the Meeting</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Haitong News Agency, the House of Commons reported the details of the Moscow Conference, stating that shortening the war and resolving European issues were the main goals of the meeting. Eden, the chief British representative to the Moscow Conference, told the House of Commons that although agreement could not be reached on all aspects of the European issue, at least the views of the various countries are now clear. During the discussion with our Soviet friends at this conference, new enthusiasm and new beliefs were aroused on both sides, especially regarding military issues. The declaration of the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China on war cooperation and collective security measures was proposed by US Secretary of State Hull, who is a talented politician. Eden then elaborated on the need for new organizations to integrate the political interests of various countries. The cornerstone of this new organization has been laid at the Moscow Conference, which may be the most important achievement of the Moscow Conference. The newly established European Advisory Committee can be formally established. The nature of the committee is only advisory, and the committee will submit the dispute resolution of European issues to the major powers for adoption, so that time can be saved and misunderstandings can be eliminated. Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union bear the most important responsibility for maintaining lasting peace after the war. As the Italian Affairs Committee will ensure the common policy of the Allied countries towards Italy, the activities and policies of the Allied military authorities stationed in Italy have also been informed to the Soviet Union. All issues in Europe were discussed at the Moscow Conference, but I will not deny that the agreement of the three countries has not been obtained on every point, but we have clearly understood the views of the various countries. Eden briefly mentioned his meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Naimen Gru in Cairo, saying: "We exchanged views on the general situation after the Moscow Conference. The Turkish Foreign Minister has now returned to Ankara to report the results of the talks to his government. There is nothing else to report besides this." Eden refused to disclose the details of the measures to shorten the war.</p>
<h3>Hull Returns Home with a Letter from Stalin</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to Washington, US Secretary of State Hull handed a letter from Stalin to President Roosevelt after returning to Washington. It is said that the content of the letter will not be disclosed to the press.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Reshuffle, New Ministry of Construction Established</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 12th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency London News: The British government officially announced the cabinet reshuffle on Thursday evening, and the list is as follows:</p>
<p>Wootton was appointed as Minister of Construction and Minister of War in the House of Commons. Link was appointed as Minister of Health, Lee Hurley as Minister of Food, Pauley as Minister of Lancaster County, Smith as Minister of Supply in Washington, and Captain Porter as Secretary of the Aircraft Production Department. The Minister of Aviation, Watt, was the aide-de-camp of Lord Wootton and the speaker of the building in the House of Commons. The British Emperor has approved Cooper's resignation from the post of Minister of Lancaster County.</p>
<h3>Turkish Cabinet Meeting Listens to Foreign Minister's Report</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Turkish government convened a cabinet meeting yesterday to listen to Foreign Minister Mennemenjoglu's report on the meeting in Cairo, which lasted for three hours. After the meeting, the foreign minister met with reporters and said that there was no special news to announce about the Cairo meeting. German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, met with Turkish Prime Minister Saracoglu on the 7th, and will meet with the Turkish President or Foreign Minister within days before returning to his country on the 13th.</p>
<p>US Ambassador Returns to Post</p>
<p>Ankara, 12th (Central News Agency) - US Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, returned to the United States a few days ago to report on his duties and has now arrived here.</p>
<p>Ankara, 12th (Central News Agency) - Turkish newspapers, with official authorization, strictly denied the British report that Turkey was preparing to provide bases to the Allied forces and that Turkey's attitude was changing. Turkish newspapers historically stated that Turkish foreign policy remains unchanged, which proves that the Turkish government, for the sake of the country's interests, does not want to change its neutral policy. However, the Allied forces are now exerting pressure on Turkey. It is said that the British ambassador to Turkey, Hugh, told his friends before leaving here that there is no neutrality in this war.</p>
<h3>de Gaulle Forcibly Interferes in Lebanese Internal Affairs, President and Prime Minister Arrested</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 12th (Central News Agency) - Since the Lebanese Parliament began deliberating on the constitutional amendment last week, up to the 10th, with the exception of two abstentions, it declared in the name of the whole that the Lebanese Republic was completely independent and had absolute autonomy, and passed the constitutional amendment stipulating Arabic as the official language. As a result, it directly clashed with the pro-French puppet regime based on the Versailles system, and the coup d'état has begun to suppress the independence movement of the Lebanese aborigines by force. After the constitutional amendment was passed, General Helou, the High Commissioner of Lebanon and Syria sent by the Free France Committee, immediately ordered the banning of the publication of any news in newspapers. The natives of Beirut and Tripoli expressed great dissatisfaction with the government's serious suppression, and the situation was quite fierce. In view of this, Helou sent African troops to surround the presidential palace on the 12th in order to prevent problems before they occurred. Although President Kurli was softened at the official residence, Prime Minister El-Solh and a member of the cabinet were dismissed, and as a result, the unstable situation in northern Lebanon became increasingly tense. In Beirut, there were large-scale demonstrations by the natives, and the police force also did not obey orders. Therefore, High Commissioner Helou issued martial law in Beirut on the afternoon of the 11th, and the African civil army maintained order, but the city's traffic patrol agencies had completely ceased operations, and communication with the outside world was also cut off. High Commissioner Helou broadcasted on the morning of the 11th in Beirut that in order to suppress the conspiracy to resist the French government, the Lebanese Republic was placed under martial law and troops were sent to strategic points in Beirut and other cities. In the afternoon, it was announced that based on the order of the Free France Committee, the Lebanese government and the House of Representatives were dissolved, the new constitution was invalid, and the experience was delivered to the ground. It is said that High Commissioner Helou has pushed a person named Ayte out to clean up the remnants and declared in a stern manner that in this difficult situation, I will come forward to take over the government, be sure to protect the independence of Lebanon, and bend the people to maintain calm.</p>
<p>Egyptian Protest</p>
<p>Ankara, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to Cairo, Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas met with the representative of the Algiers Committee in the Middle East on Wednesday and strongly protested against the measures taken by the de Gaulle authorities in Lebanon. He mentioned that General de Gaulle had assured that the Lebanese issue would be resolved in a reasonable and fair manner. The current attitude of the Algiers Committee violates this guarantee. Britain and France had allowed Syria and Lebanon to become independent, and France's trusteeship of Syria was therefore cancelled. It is untenable to say that it is still a trustee before France officially returns the trusteeship. The League of Nations has ceased operations, and Syria and Lebanon cannot wait for the reformed League of Nations to formally approve the British and French recognition of Syria's independence.</p>
<p>British Reaction</p>
<p>Amsterdam, 12th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reported that de Gaulle's troops occupied the Lebanese capital of Beirut and arrested the country's president and several cabinet members, which has aroused widespread attention. According to a broadcast from London, British Ambassador to Beirut, General Spears, has protested to the de Gaulle representative in Beirut. It is claimed that de Gaulle's actions were not discussed with the British side beforehand. The British Deputy Foreign Minister said yesterday in the House of Commons that the situation in Lebanon seems quite serious, but as the details are not known, the British government is temporarily unable to express any comments.</p>
<p>US Remains Silent</p>
<p>Geneva, 12th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reported that, according to a Washington correspondent for the New York Times, the White House and the State Department have remained silent regarding General de Gaulle's measures to consolidate his power in Lebanon. The correspondent continued that even if there are any countermeasures being considered, Washington will not announce them.</p>
<h3>Group Offensive in the Kiev Region Meets Strong German Resistance</h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency: The Soviet offensive has now entered its fifth month, but the Soviet Union still wants to maintain its offensive posture, at the expense of manpower. Over the past eleven months, the Soviet Union has received a large number of workers, so it has been able to transfer its own people from its arms factories to military service. The Soviet army's combat can only take advantage of its strong manpower, and only by launching group offensives between the Chiniyev and Umer groups can it continue to maintain the pressure of a partial offensive. The purpose is to transfer the German troops deployed in the Kiel area. The Rongtie battle is still in full swing. After the Sui army retreated to the new position, the vanguard troops made a smooth advance and launched fierce battles. The enemy seems to have weakened its pressure, and the target of the enemy is still to advance to the south and south. However, the strong German resistance caused heavy damage to it, and the counterattack forced it to abandon the iron bend position it had gained on the upper and lower reaches of the Tiebo River, with only partial battles. The enemy continued to apply pressure on the Beilebey Pu Isthmus, but the battle situation did not change. The enemy continued to launch attacks on the Kouch Peninsula, making some progress in the north of Kouch. The war between the Niewell region and the Minsk-Smolensk highway is also maintaining sourness.</p>

<h3>Youth League Branch Departments Held Flag Conferral Ceremony Yesterday; Commander Chen Personally Presided</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Yesterday, after the ceremony commemorating the realization of the Father of the Nation's will, the Shanghai Special City Department of the Chinese Youth immediately held a flag conferral ceremony for various branch departments at the racetrack (original site of the ceremony). Those present included Commander Chen Gongbo, who also serves as the head of the department and Mayor Chen, as well as Deputy Commanders Lin Jiong'an and Wen, along with over ten thousand youth league members from various branch departments and deputy commanders in the city, creating an unprecedented grand occasion.</p>

So today, I also want to tell you a few simple words. We know that today's report is that we are commemorating the Father of the Nation. All unequal treaties have been abolished. But you must know, where did these unequal treaties come from? It was because we lacked organized strength. Therefore, abolishing unequal treaties is the responsibility of our own citizens. How can we shoulder this responsibility? It depends on whether we have strength. To have strength, we must first have organization. The New Citizen Movement is organization. Our movement should be based on our organization, cultivate strength, and maintain the independence and freedom of the Republic of China." After the address, Commander Chen led everyone in shouting "Long Live the Nation," the sound reverberating through the clouds, filled with national spirit.</p>

<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>Discussing the Future of the Sino-European Common Market</h3>
<p>— Shao</p>
<p>The formal reopening of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange is undoubtedly an initial expression of the responsible authorities' thorough reorganization of the Chinese stock market. How to effectively promote reasonable operations in the future, and how to eliminate past malpractices, are all the main responsibilities of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange in the future. There is no need for a third party to dwell on it. However, on the occasion of the Securities Exchange's imminent formal operation, with the sincerity of protecting the national capital investment market, I am willing to contribute my limited views from a national standpoint for the joint review of the Securities Exchange authorities and gentlemen.</p>
<p>1.  Trading Methods – The current trading methods in the Chinese stock market are widely criticized. And the impact is such that genuine investors are hesitant, while general speculators regard it as profitable, and general stockbrokers even consider it to be an improper benefit of considerable income. According to regulations, stockbrokers themselves cannot engage in stock trading, but only accept client commissions for trading activities. However, the current situation is that general stockbrokers directly engage in trading. For example, when a stock owner, Mr. A, needs cash and sells his stock, the stock company does not seek a transferee on his behalf, but becomes the buyer itself after lowering its price. Conversely, if the stock company is commissioned to purchase stocks, the stock company falsely sells them to the buyer at a price higher than the market price. Then, it replenishes its falsely sold amount at a lower price. This situation is what is known in the market as "long floating" and "short floating," and "long-short support." The existence of this unreasonable and irregular trading method has often stirred up many unnecessary fluctuations in the stock market. And these fluctuations are often centered around the company (i.e., the stockbroker). And it is promoted by other colleagues. Moreover, the official transaction market price is hidden by the stock company group. They each hang different buying and selling prices. And the difference between the selling price and the buying price is so huge! For example, for a stock with a face value of ten yuan, whose market price is eleven or twelve yuan, the difference between the buying and selling prices marked by the stock company is actually as much as one or two yuan, which is truly alarming! Thus, as the trend spreads, general stock companies try to attract customers with low commissions, while on the other hand, they are actually "profiteering" and "exploiting." In particular, the wind of manipulating the market is also rising! The general public's impression is that the Chinese stock market is like a disguised casino. Therefore, the establishment of the Chinese stock market in the past failed to complete its task of absorbing investors and largely controlling speculative funds, but instead became a paradise for many speculators!</p>
<p>In the future, when the Securities Exchange formally reopens, in terms of trading methods, we must avoid the current defects, abolish "continuous trading," and adopt the "bidding price purchase" method to block the door for brokers to illegally profit, and achieve the effect of unified prices.</p>
<p>The scope of regulations should also be carefully revised, such as stipulating that the daily range of price increases and decreases should not exceed a certain percentage of the market value, so as to avoid the danger of Chinese stock trading excessively leaning towards speculation. The limitation and crackdown on stockbrokers' own buying and selling transactions are even more important.</p>
<p>2.  Qualifications of Stockbrokers – The qualifications of stockbrokers must be strictly examined, selecting the few and the elite, and not the many and the mixed! It is currently rumored that after the reopening of the Securities Exchange, there will be two hundred brokers. If this number is too large in reality, it is quite difficult to seek quality if the number is large! Moreover, low commission revenue, etc., only benefit the small ones. Even for the brokers themselves, there is a disadvantage of dispersing business. Moreover, if the number is too large, it will also be difficult for the Exchange to manage properly.</p>
<p>In addition to having sound credit, capital, and sufficient experience, the qualifications of stockbrokers should also include a progressive review of the shareholders' character and qualifications. If relatives of government officials or government officials themselves are involved, their qualifications should be denied, and there should be absolutely no favoritism or protection. Stockbrokers, based on the prohibited rules, are only involved in buying and selling, which is currently not thoroughly implemented. Some officials themselves do not come forward to participate, but are represented by their relatives and friends. Although it is not easy to detect at first, the Securities Exchange authorities must send personnel to investigate from time to time, and once discovered, they must immediately suspend their broker business. I am afraid of the wind of the stock exchange before the war, so I have to hope that the authorities will order a detailed assessment, so that the procedures are slightly cumbersome without causing a speculative surge, which would cause suffering to the people.</p>
<p>3.  Review of Listed Stocks – According to the current review principles announced by the Securities Exchange, it can be said that they are generally quite detailed and strict. However, regarding the "must have at least one year of history" for listed stock companies, once this is discussed, my view is the same as that of the readers, that is, for those who have a detailed and accurate business plan, and whose business directly or indirectly benefits the national economy and the people's livelihood, even if it is a newly established enterprise, it should be allowed. For those who do not benefit the people's livelihood, or whose management methods are poor, technology is backward, and does not meet the "efficiency" standards of war economy, or who do not have a correct business plan, or who do not engage in production at all and only absorb stock funds as speculative funds, or whose production work has been suspended for a considerable period of time or more and has not yet resumed operations, etc., even if they have a history of more than one year, there is no reason to approve the listing of their stocks. Here, I hope that the Securities Exchange authorities can use this principle from time to time, accepting listing applications for those that are not yet listed and giving them a reasonable review, as well as a detailed review, to see if they can pass.</p>
<p>4.  Restrictions and Approval of Capital Increases – In order to protect investors' funds, appropriate management must be given to the funds of listed stocks. On the one hand, a thorough investigation must be carried out to ensure that there is a genuine reason for the capital increase before approval is given. On the other hand, strict limits should be placed on the amount of the capital increase, which must not exceed the actual needs. We believe that the implementation of this strict management can at least avoid speculative stocks from entering the market and affecting investors' confidence in stocks, and the stability of stock prices will naturally be achieved.</p>
<p>In reality, the capital increase methods of many industrial and commercial enterprises are too worrying. For example, if an enterprise was established a year ago with a capital of one million yuan, and its business has not been very successful so far, but its production equipment is worth ten million yuan due to the rise in prices and the depreciation of the currency. That is, what is generally called earning nine million yuan. Therefore, even if the entrepreneurs do not have a correct plan and grasp of future expansion, they use "sending shares" as a selling point, so that shareholders first pay for their bonus shares before they have obtained any real benefits. If commodity prices fall sharply, the enterprise's losses will be borne entirely by the shareholders. On the contrary, it only provides a means for speculators to collect new stock funds, and then use them for centralized raw material stockpiling and equipment investment, thereby engaging in improper business activities. As for the pure "capital increase through sending shares" of some enterprises, in addition to the attempt to evade tax obligations and attract the attention of speculators, there is no other reasonable reason or improvement in their own business effect.</p>
<p>In short, now is still an "extraordinary period," and commodity prices and exchange rates have not yet reached the most reasonable stability. When any enterprise is temporarily established and "increases capital" (actually, it is a dividend distribution) due to the increase in the value of equipment and raw materials, special vigilance should be exercised. In addition to the Securities Exchange authorities strictly and thoroughly performing their supervisory and management duties, they should also provide the general public with correct guidance on investment, such as hiring experts and impartial individuals to organize specialized institutions for investigation and statistics, and regularly publishing their investigation and statistical data and conclusions to guide investment funds to gather in the most beneficial enterprises for the national economy and the people's livelihood, and the most excellent enterprises for investment. The troubled investors who do not know where to go can largely get reasonable guidance, and the funds for purchasing raw materials can also be gathered. To completely and satisfactorily complete this, it is the responsibility of the authorities to promote industrial resurgence and national revival.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Jiangwan Wasteland</h3>
<p>Recently, the city's Food Bureau, according to the application from the representative of the Zhongtuan Development Company, has conducted a survey of the wasteland along Jungong Road, Hongzhen, Tianshi Road, Jiangtao outside the racetrack, and Yangpu Road, in order to increase production. The bureau sent personnel to investigate and found that several sections of land outside the Jiangwan Racetrack were indeed wasteland, and in accordance with the Interim Regulations for Encouraging Wasteland Reclamation, a public announcement has been made to notify the owners of the Jiangwan wasteland. We feel that although the Jiangtao wasteland is not vast, its significance lies in "accumulating sand into a tower, gathering fur into a robe." Utilizing every piece of wasteland on the outskirts of the city for reclamation, so that it can provide a considerable supplement to the city's food and vegetable supply, is not something that can be ignored in the production increase movement.</p>
<p>In June of this year, we discussed "Russian Citizens Operating Farms" with the title "Russian Citizens Operating Farms," discussing the opening up of citizen farming groups in Moscow, Russia, dividing the roads and streets connecting the suburbs to the city into garden land for cultivation, in order to remedy the food panic. One in ten thousand is considered to be a good idea that meets the needs of reality; today, "citizen farms can be seen everywhere in Moscow, ranging in size from 33,249 or more." If Shanghai can take the reclamation of Jiangtao wasteland as its starting point, and extensively and universally engage in the opening up of all wasteland in the four suburbs of Shanghai, making it a vast agricultural group, surrounding the city of five million people waiting to be fed, which is conducive to Shanghai's food and vegetable supply, it is naturally needless to say. We deeply hope that the municipal authorities, in conjunction with local food administration agencies and social welfare organizations, will pool their efforts and jointly promote this, so that the future suburban farms of Shanghai can also be comparable to the citizen garden farms of Russia, and make the same contribution to the lives of citizens in wartime.</p>
<h3>Removal of Materials Must Be Accompanied by a Permit from the Place of Import and Handled in Accordance with the Procedures of the Commercial Control Association</h3>
<p>Regarding the removal of important materials from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and the two special cities of Shanghai and Nanjing to other domestic regions, it must be approved by the National Commercial Control Association before it can be handled. When applying for removal approval, a material removal approval application form must be filled out, and a removal permit from the competent authority of the place of import must be attached.</p>
<p>North China - China United Reserve Bank Foreign Exchange Bureau Material and Price Handling Committee. Jujiang - Jujiang United Autonomous Government Finance Department. South China - Guangdong Yuehai Customs Supervision Office. Hankou - Food is the Food Bureau, other materials are the Economic Bureau. Jiangxi - Jiangxi Provincial Department of Construction. Each procedure that should be paid attention to when applying for removal approval, if the removal of materials is to be handled through bank remittance, you can currently apply to Japanese-owned banks to obtain the bank's "Substitute Group Permit Application Picture." When applying to remove materials that the Commercial Control Association has designated to be certified by various industry associations, you must first have the certificate stamped by the association before it can be accepted. As for the so-called important materials, they refer to 25 categories, including various automobiles and their parts, as well as cotton, matches, rolled tobacco, soap, oil, sugar, and leather.</p>
<h3>Food Industry Appeals for Allocation of Raw Materials, Mainly Flour, Sugar, Oil, etc.</h3>
<p>The city's machine-made sliced noodles, tea snacks, oil, cooked food, and other industry associations have over 5,000 member businesses citywide. The items they produce are primarily supplementary goods for daily consumption by ordinary residents. However, the raw materials required for production, namely flour, cooking oil, sugar, and soy sauce, etc., are scarce and stocks are low. Businesses are unable to purchase them at affordable prices on the market. They have jointly requested assistance from their respective industry associations. These associations, in the interest of their members' welfare, have repeatedly appealed to the relevant authorities, requesting the timely allocation of sufficient raw materials to ensure continued production. Initially, businesses reluctantly resorted to purchasing materials from the black market at high prices. Later, due to cost constraints and government regulations, they ceased these purchases. It is understood that many businesses are now unable to obtain affordable raw materials for production, and temporary closures are frequently reported. The associations are deeply concerned about this situation. Therefore, in anticipation of future needs, they have convened meetings to discuss solutions. It was decided that the associations will again submit formal requests to the relevant authorities, urging them to provide immediate assistance through stock allocation, ensure the timely and sufficient supply of raw materials, so that they can resume operations and secure the livelihoods of their workers.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Production Increases, Procurement Work Proceeds Smoothly</h3>
<p>The tobacco procurement work of the Huazhong Tobacco Company in the Fengyang and Suzhou areas is proceeding smoothly. Currently, it is the peak production season, so the procurement funds have been increased by an unspecified amount. The anticipated procurement volume for this year is approximately 120,000 units higher than last year.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Soap and Candle Control, Professional Department to be Formed</h3>
<p>According to sources in the commerce sector, the allocation of soap and daily necessities has already been implemented. If necessary, candle rationing will also be implemented. Meanwhile, to strengthen the control of these two daily necessities, the Chamber of Commerce may form a specialized soap and candle department for management.</p>

<h3>The Central Reserve Bank is Studying and Adjusting Funds Needed for Revitalizing Production</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - Under our international participation in the war effort, the most important wartime economic policies are stabilizing currency and rationalizing the supply and demand of materials. These tasks, carried out collaboratively by the Central Reserve Bank and the National Commercial Control Association, have yielded significant results. The issuance of currency has recently become extremely comprehensive, and the problem of fund deployment has been fully resolved by the Central Reserve Bank. From now on, currency work will be smoothly incorporated into the system, and the rational application of future economic policies can be expected. Moreover, to increase production, the government should encourage all kinds of production talents and guide their enthusiasm for enterprise. In this regard, the Central Reserve Bank must establish a Central Reserve Note adjustment policy and strive for its rationalization. Therefore, the Central Reserve Note will enter a new stage in response to the new situation. It is heard that the Central Reserve Bank is currently conducting research on the adjustment of funds needed for revitalizing production.</p>

<h3>An Ideal Orphanage</h3>
<p>— Baimen</p>
<p>Scientific Education Method</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the children who have been cultivated and educated by Baimen and found a way out of the orphanage are enviable, lovable, and admirable.</p>
<p>After entering the orphanage, the helpless orphans first undergo various scientific and simplified tests to determine the special education methods to be used in the future. Ms. Zhao Bi, who is in charge of educational affairs at the Shanghai Orphanage, said that the work of the educational affairs department is quite busy. It includes research and implementation of various tests, class organization and curriculum distribution, teaching material selection and teaching method research, performance evaluation and competition organization, management and distribution of books and stationery, and even guidance for trips and visits, etc. There is hardly any free time every day, which is different from ordinary schools.</p>
<p>In order to carry out educational work, the orphanage has established a Ciyou Elementary School, which is a complete elementary school with complete editing and equipment, exactly the same as a regular elementary school. In order to promote strict national education, a full-day class system is implemented. There are currently three grades: first and second combined, third and fourth combined, and fifth and sixth combined. Each grade is located on the second floor, and each class is marked with "Class Motto," which serves as a standard for learning behavior. The walls are full of learning competition slogans and achievements, filled with vigor. In order to improve the students' level, on the one hand, supplementary teaching materials are added in addition to the original teaching materials for each grade. On the other hand, because the student mobility is relatively large, and some of them - such as female children - are over-age children, in addition to the general class education, the "Little Teacher System" advocated by Tao Xingzhi and others in the past is implemented, using individual teaching and ability grouping methods to remedy this shortcoming and achieve "catching up." Therefore, the academic level of general students is not only not lower than that of ordinary elementary schools, but also exceeds that of ordinary elementary schools. According to reports, all graduates of the Ciyou Elementary School in the previous session were admitted to the Shenbao Scholarship, Xinwenbao Scholarship, and free tuition at various famous middle schools in this city, which proves the success of their teaching methods. However, how much effort did this consume from the educators!</p>
<p>In addition to basic written language learning, in order to meet the needs of the times and the practical needs of poor children, they are conducting life education and natural education closely related to daily life, so that these children not only learn written knowledge, but also understand the reality of society and the correct direction of life.</p>
<p>Turning Stone into Gold</p>
<p>Training is very important in the orphanage. The orphanage has specially set up a "Natural Education Department." Mr. Xian Zihua, who is in charge of training work, said that the work of training mainly includes: research and investigation of training plans, research and implementation of adjustment methods, guidance of children's self-governing affairs, research and execution of discipline, and management of children's life order, etc. Because the orphanage is a complete orphanage, it maintains close relations with the educational affairs department.</p>
<p>The children admitted to the orphanage can be said to be abandoned by society. Therefore, when children first enter the orphanage, 95% are illiterate and more than 90% have bad habits. Due to the influence of the past poor living environment, they form different bad personalities. To transform these illiterate, bad-habited children into healthy little citizens, the difficulty of the work can be imagined. What method should be used? The person in charge said, "We believe that only by borrowing the power of great education, promoting the New Enlightenment Movement, and cultivating children's correct understanding of the universe, the world, and life; while promoting children's self-governing affairs and stimulating children's potential vitality, can they be guided onto the right track." They are working towards this goal.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, the Shanghai Orphanage has discovered many outstanding talents among the unfortunate children, which is in line with the saying "Loyal ministers often come from humble beginnings" in our history. However, what they are doing is not just a matter of finding gold among the sand, but "turning stone into gold," or more precisely, the hard work of refining gold!</p>
<p>Currently, the orphanage divides training into group training and individual training. The latter uses the method of individual discussion to implement individual assessment and differentiated treatment. They have formulated various methods of praise and punishment. The aspects of punishment are divided into scolding, repentance, isolation, and suspension of rights, etc. The aspects of reward are divided into honorary awards, material awards, priority rights, and special rights. These punishments are determined by the discipline department of the Ciyou Service Corps, which is organized by the children themselves, and the instructors decide. In the event of major incidents, a public trial may be held to make a decision. However, the focus of education is placed on group training, especially on the guidance of children's self-government work. The Children's Service Corps serves as the self-governing organization for the residents, with all the faculty and staff serving as advisors and the training department staff as the main advisors. The organization of this service corps is quite large and the work is unusually complicated, and it is even the core of the training work.</p>
<p>Ciyou Service Corps</p>
<p>The core of the training work of the Ciyou Orphanage—the Ciyou Service Corps—is located in the house facing the campus, filled with the spirit of the military. On the walls hang charts and documents of the relevant undertakings. In addition to the Secretariat, there are six departments. The Secretariat is in charge of the minutes of the conference and all internal and external documents. It is also a training institution for residents.</p>
<p>The Academic Department has four shares and two societies, including the Library Department, which manages the books of all levels and evaluates extracurricular reading performance, the Music Society, which has organized bands and singing teams, the Drama Society, which rehearses dramas for commemorative days or performances during gatherings, the Gathering Share, which holds performance reviews, discussions, and achievement exhibitions, as well as reviews of the training in various task centers, and the Manufacturing Share, which implements the recycling of waste paper to create various thin felt. In addition, there is the Ciyou Bimonthly Society, which posts on the wall newspaper at the entrance of the dining hall. It is published every half month, and collects works from children of all levels, and compiles and publishes special issues or special editions when promoting public persuasion on special holidays or when the training department implements a certain central training. This department is supervised by the staff of the Educational Affairs Department.</p>
<p>In order to promote physical education, a Physical Education Department is specially set up, including track and field teams, ball teams, dance groups, and extracurricular sports shares. Residents of all levels freely choose to participate. The track and field team pays attention to daily track and field practice and competitions. The ball team pays attention to various ball games and competitions. The dance group pays attention to group dance practice and performances. The extracurricular sports share is responsible for distributing and managing extracurricular sports. All departments are advised and guided by Ms. Wang Qing, the physical education teacher.</p>
<p>The daily life of the residents is disciplined, and the discipline is also maintained by the residents themselves. The Ciyou Service Corps has a Discipline Department, with the staff of the Training Department as advisors. Here, there is a Classroom Share, which presides over the order competition at all levels and promotes classroom routines. There is also a Playground Share, which maintains the good order of the playground. There is also a Dormitory Share, which manages the order of each dormitory and counts disturbances. In addition, they also have a patrol team, which manages the overall order of the orphanage under the management of the Discipline Minister (elected by the residents and concurrently serving as the captain of the patrol team. The self-management of the residents is very similar to that of a military academy.</p>
<p>Even the training work is undertaken by the residents themselves. The Ciyou Service Corps has a Training Department, which is divided into six shares: the Staff Training Share, which trains the staff of the service corps, the New Student Training Share, which guides new students who have problems, the Propaganda Share, which conducts publicity and explanation for the central training of each department, the Guidance Share, which helps teachers to guide students to correct bad tendencies. In addition, there are also the Labor Share, which guides junior and intermediate level residents to study on their own and seeks to increase work efficiency for working students. All the work of this department is guided by staff members of the Training Department.</p>
<p>In addition, there are the Hygiene Department and the Thrift Department. Almost all aspects of life are based on building a foundation for sound citizenship in the orphanage.</p>

<h3>Feng Biantang's Charity Sale Helps Distressed Children</h3>
<p>Our Eight Immortals Bridge Branch has repeatedly called for charity sales for various charitable organizations, raising donations.

After deducting expenses from the total proceeds, one portion will be donated to the Academy as a fund. Feng Biantang's ink, stationery, and natural incense.</p>

I will provide free consultation and medicine regardless of the time or amount. However, it must be verified by your newspaper to be effective." Address: 3 Maiwei Bao Road, phone number 87266.</p>
<h3>Cold Clothing Lament</h3>
<p>— Shi Xiong</p>
<p>How bleak is the autumn feeling? The path is hesitant. Compatriots bow their heads sadly, the cold clothes are long and layered. Money rings out in mournful cries! The spinning industry bustles merrily; We look forward to generosity and swiftly rescue the world with our meager purses.</p>
