<h3>如何實施文化宣傳政策綱要</h3>
<p>現代世界戰爭，不只是武力的戰爭，並且是文化的戰爭，也就是不只要鬥力，並且更要鬥智；不只要使對方畏威，並且要使敵國服德，這種新的戰略，在我們中國歷史上是數見不鮮的，兵家孫吳有一攻心」之術，儒家的孔孟有「以德服人」之我，又如孫中山先生在其革命幾經失敗之後，更曾一再主張「宣傳重於作戰」的策略，勸勉革命黨人勿徒靠兵力，更要注力於宣傳。（見民國十二年十二月一日國民黨改組演說詞：要靠黨員成功，不專靠軍隊成功」。及同年十二月三十日對各黨員演說詞：「國民黨奮鬥之法，宜兼注重宣傳，不宜專注重軍事。」）因爲兵力的脅服是暫時的，是局部的，而文化的感化才是永遠的，才是全面的。特別是我們東方民族，一向尊重「王道」，與歐美的「制覇」思想完全相反，今日要求打倒英美及建設世界新秩序，更應該充分發揮東方文化的特點，輔助武裝，以完遂戰爭目的。因此，我們自國府參戰以來，即提出「確立戰時文化政策綱領」的要求。（見二月十五日本報社評」，希望政府確立戰時文化宣傳的總力體制。日前國府已經公布「戰時文化宣傳政策基本綱要」，適如我們輿論的期待，誠可慶幸。</p>
<p>六月十日公布的「戰時文化宣傳政策基本綱要」，首先確定了戰時文化宣傳政策的方針，明白標示：「一面促進大東亞戰爭之完遂，一面力謀中國文化之重建與發展，及東亞文化之融合與創造，進而貢獻於新秩序之世界文化。」從此以後，不但政府機關的文化宣傳工作者有了明確方針可資循遵，即是一般人民與輿論界，也可以因此積極振奮，互相勸勉，在共同的方針之下，作多方面的協力，以求其貫澈實現。在這樣明確的方針之下，大家再不用徬徨了，這個方針，應該是動員起一切官民文化宣傳力量的大蠢，只要最後的目標是向着這面大纛的，我們就得充分發揮自己的能力，鼓勇邁進了。</p>
<p>戰時文化宣傳政策基本綱要規定了七大要領，綱舉目張，並加必要的說明，對於確立文化宣傳總力體制的具體辦法，已經詳加規定。在消極方面，我們要淸算英美侵略主義之罪惡，掃除英美個人自由主義之毒素思想，消滅依賴英美之卑劣心理，同時，我們要防止國際共產主義之擾亂，掃除階級鬥爭之毒素思想，發揚中國固有之民族倫理觀念。特別針對當前特殊的現象而明白揭示革除享樂的，頹廢的，放任的，末流習氣，更指出和糾正盲目復古，盲目祟外排外的錯誤思想。所有這種消極方面的奮鬥目標，實際上不僅在文化宣傳上必須努力推動，並且，在一般國民實際的思想言論與行爲上，亦須各自警惕。不過，我們決不要對這些必須革除的對象表示畏懼害怕，特別是從事於文化宣傳工作的，允須提高自信心，以醫藥化騐學家莊嚴英勇的態度，去細心觀察，分析，研究，方能加以澈底的消滅，正象對付疫菌一樣，只有加以認識，研究之後，才能加以撲滅，若是只知望之生畏與迴避，結果是很危險的。</p>
<p>在積極方面，戰時文化宣傳政策基本綱要規定了必須：（一）認定大東亞戰爭之完遂，爲一切東亞理想實現之前提；國家集團主義，爲東亞新秩序建設之準則；中國文化，爲東亞文化之一環，應把握中日文化之實體，發揚東亞文化，鞏固東亞軸心，完成戰爭之使命。（二）養成勤勞的，積極的，向上的，自肅的人生觀，以實踐的責任心，協力戰時體制之完成，增强國家戰鬥之總力。（三）統合國家民族共同意志，發揮全體之創造能力，復興固有文化，以强化中國文化之基幹。（四）普及科學敎育，掖助科學研究，改進科學技術，獎勵科學發明。（五）集中文化人才，團結文化力量，調整文化事業，確立文化宣傳總力體制。凡此諸端，政府公布的基本綱要中都有扼要的說明，適與本報近來所主張與獻言者若合符節（參閱申報評論選第一集），我們始終認爲消極的制裁，不如積極的領導，在政治上如此，在文化上允關重要。現在政府這個文化宣傳綱領，主要的中心，於就在積極的領導一點上，規定以上諸要領，實可謂最孚輿望之舉。我們今日所要求者，是迅速和誠摯的實踐。這裏，就不但有待於有關當局之勞力，更有待於各方面有志之士的投袂而起。</p>
<p>實施戰時文化宣傳政策綱要的最要一點，在政府當局是積極的領導重於消極的制裁，是各文化宣傳機構本身之充實與强化，是在政治上與經濟上保障文化人能安心工作進而團結一致，特別是最後一點，對於全部政策具有決定的作用，我們竭誠希望政府特別注意，眞正的人才集中了，眞正的文化力量團結起來了，不只是形式上人數上而且是實質上團結起來了，才是保障政策實現的最大力量。在文化界方面，我們期望自此基本綱要公希以後，一掃過去的陰雲暗影，各以自己的能力與摯誠，加强自己的工作與文化界的團結，特別是對於文化人的生活之保障，文化事業之分工合作，中國文化復興與中日文化融化與創造，首先有賴於文化界人士本身之覺悟與先進份子的率先創導，我們實有不勝額手以待之情。</p>
<p>昨日星期評論載吉田東祐先生所著「眞正日本通與中國通的話』一文，內若干節譯意未盡完善，爰再補正如後，希讀者比對參閱爲荷。</p>
<p>（一）第一段第一句，應譯爲：「近代中國所產生的全世界聞名的文明批評家辜鴻銘氏」。</p>
<p>（二）第五段一至三行「日本的愛國精神……沒有理解日本的眞意」，應改爲：「日本式的愛國精神，漸使中國走向光明，他們之所以成爲革命黨者，與其說是他們對於日本某一種塲合之處置，會煽動起排日運動，倒莫如說是他們有值得欽佩的覺醒意識……」同段第三行「本無何種革命意味」應譯爲「無煽動革命的意味」。</p>
<p>（三）末段是引證辜鴻銘氏之語，故前後應加引號·第一句以譯成『今日的日本人，實際上就是吸取唐朝精髓的眞正中國人」爲佳。最後三句則應譯爲：「日本應用歐洲現代文明的利器雖然好，但必須以東洋的道德心作基礎來應用，以保護這枝花朶與土地。』</p>

<p>東京十三日中央社電　日政府於十五日召開本屆臨時議會，政府方面所擬具之企業整備資金措置法案，曁豫定提交審議之其他各法律案刻已擬妥。政府對議會方策所採取之萬全措置，及於開會時將向中外表明日本所信之東條首相施政方針演說，亦俱經閣議决定。同時議會方面之準備工作，大致亦告完成。關於日本現階段中所採取之對內對外施政方針綱要，俱包括於東條首相於本屆議會中所發表之演說內，因此日首相此次施政演說，實至堪注視。東條首相之演說，將闡明日政府要求召開本屆臨時議會之主要目標，爲將毅然實行整備企業及增產糧食，俾確立日本國內決戰經濟體制之方針。並將闡明爲指示全國遵循之方針，及基於標立日本國內決戰經濟體制與建設大東亞共榮圈爲表裏一體之舉，實爲與共榮圈內總力所必須完遂者，明示大東亞各地域之團結强化及建設必成之一途。故此次東條首相演說，實可視爲向中外闡明日本爲適應此次決戰已確立堅固不動之必勝體制，實具有劃期之意義。</p>
<h3>龐炳勳發表談話　對記者闡明參加和運抱負　將晋京謁汪主席面呈所懷</h3>
<p>濟南十三日中央社電　龐炳勳將軍抵濟南後，特於本日上午十時在此間山東賓館會見中日記者，闡明參加和運之抱負稱：目前余所憂慮者，即將如何展開剿共工作，余始終抱定一貫之主念，認共產黨絕不容於中國，余部下第四十軍，第二十七軍，新編第五軍之忠實兵士，曾連續與共產軍鬥爭達三年之久，而余前在重慶召開之數次將領會議中，亦曾强力主張剿共，是可知余一生對剿共宗旨與決意。蓋剿共工作爲和平建國必經之途。再者，日本自對我國推行新政策後，當時余即深爲感動，兼自各國復行撤廢治外法權，交還租界，於是渝方之抗戰力量瞬即摧毀，故於眞實救國之目的下，率軍參加和運。余今後更將加强自身之信念，願與友軍恊力剿滅共匪，以剷除東亞之障碍，余復擬從事對殘存華北之渝方勢力盡量吸收。再者，余近將晋京向汪主席面呈所懷。</p>
<p>顏秀五氏在京談話</p>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　第一集團軍副總司令兼第二十四師師長顏秀五日昨抵京，記者聞訊往訪，承發表談話如次：余不常來京，實因蘇北城市之防務重要，本人未能擅離防守，此次晋京係專誠覲見主席請訓，並報告我軍剿匪以及最近防務各情形。余早已倡主席偉大的和建國策，隨李總司令參加和運，二年餘來目覩一切光明的事實，使余益加信仰，所以參加苦幹越感興趣。至現在蘇北情形即就本集團軍防區而論，匪徒歛迹，地方漸臻安謐，人民皆能安居樂業，此由於李總司令素以保衛地方爲本責，而所率部隊咸能服從命令，努力從事所致。誠以匪類不淸，無以靖地方，地方不寗，無以施善政，更須以推進和建國策，爲吾軍之任務，即本汪主席曁李總司令之意旨，先從安靖地方愛護百姓做去，使軍民打成一片，然後能增加和建工作，戮力分擔大東亞戰爭的責任，來達成國父大亞洲主義的大計，與友邦共存共榮。</p>

<h3>中共愈陷窘境　毛澤東將赴蘇</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　頃據確息，蘇聯宣布解散第三國際後，中共已成爲失怙之孤兒，目前雖尙未暴露顯著之窘狀，然已可預斷其未來命運必陷於困境而無疑。最近，渝方在軍事政治各方面已大施壓迫，即爲明證。中共首願目下焦慮異常，故已決定由毛澤東於本月杪赴蘇，就中共現在之處境及今後之歸趨，向蘇聯方面申訴，以期邀得蘇聯之同情。</p>
<h3>渝方靑年團指導者　張充山參加和運</h3>
<p>開封十三日中央社電　前在渝方任抗日靑年團指導者之張充山，深感自國府參戰，日方採取新對華政策後，抗戰價值已完全喪失，故最近秘密脫出重慶來開封。按張君在事變勃發時留學日本早稻田大學，歸國後經西安·洛陽而至重慶，活躍政界，爲渝方抗戰陣營中之尖銳份子。張君抵開封後，該最近渝方之實情如次：重慶因懼日機之轟炸，各行政機關全部遷往郊外辦公，約需汽車二小時之行程始可達到，每逢日機空襲時，重慶即全滔於麻痺狀態，前年遭空襲時，有二萬避難民衆窒死於防空壕內。緣日機分數次來襲，渝市防空壕內數十萬避難民衆不能一刻出外，被嚴密封閉於壕中，逐漸悶窒，而避難民衆企圖開門外出，又被軍士阻止，民衆乃羣擁往出口，但因門板被羣衆塞住，不能開啓，因而民衆遂一一窒息，死者達一一萬人之多，情景至爲凄慘，故此實非轟炸之咎，而須歸罪於渝軍。渝當局事後雖爲如何宣傳，但距事實太遠，民衆遂逐漸不予相信，渝當局鑒於威信已墜，爲圖緩和公務員間之不穩，乃使彼等對將來之前途懷有希望起見，乃宣傳擬定「遷都計劃」，着各機關自明年度起開始準備工作，其所謂遷都，係指遷返南京而言，故公務員中並無一人置信。後當日東條首相先後訪問中。滿及菲島等地，渝方聞悉大爲衝動，同時重慶人士對英美已毫不信任，當日政府聲明將在華專管租界交還國民政府時，大公報曾大肆抨擊英美、使其頗感狼狽。又前次英人所作之奪回細甸等誇大宣傳，渝方對之並無一人置信，對於美國則因其不斷此大量軍需品援助英蘇兩國，而對渝方之援助，則幾告絕跡，故至表不滿。此次龐炳勛。孫殿英將軍等率部七萬參加和運之消息，經重慶大公報及其他各報揭載後，旅居重慶市內之華北各地居民，歸鄕之念因而益熾，余至洛陽時，曾獲聆龐炳勛將軍廣播　加和平之聲明，所予渝方各要人之影響實深，一般市民渴望逃歸和平地區之念，並日益濃厚。</p>
<h3>岩崎報道部長　昨來滬轉道赴任　三品新部長已抵任接事</h3>

<h3>禾各區敎育會　召開首次會議</h3>
<p>嘉興十三日中央社電　嘉興敎局爲謀改進各區敎育行政及便於督促指導各民敎館學校起見，特組織區敎育委員會，定本月二十日召開第一次區敎育會委員會議，共同商討推進方策。</p>
<h3>浙省統籌辦理淸鄕　事務局卽將成立　高度淸鄕事務室準備移交</h3>
<p>杭州十三日中央社電　浙省府爲統籌辦理本省各地區之淸鄕事務，設立浙江省淸鄕事務局，其組織亦已決定，該局直隸於浙省府，掌理本省各地區淸鄕事務之計劃，審核編纂及連絡等事宜。</p>

<h3>東京讀賣報知論　英美對異族政策</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　此間讀賣報知十二日社論，以英美之對異民族政策爲題，指出此次美國之延緩撤廢禁止中國移民法案，實爲其根據英美民族之種族歧視觀念所致。並力言爲糾正英美此種錯誤觀念，以期開闢東亞民族和平發展之大道起見，唯有努力撲滅盎格魯薩史遜民族之勢力，確切，發人深省。茲擇錄其大意如次：當此大東亞戰爭日益進展之際，使吾人至感憤慨者，厥爲英美根據其種族歧視之錯誤觀念，對於有色人種仍極端表示憎惡蔑視之態度。如日前南菲聯邦議會之通過於納塔爾及外維爾兩州內禁止印人購置土地法案：美國於煤礦罷工風潮蔓延時期，底特律之柏嘉德汽車公司中於本月初猶發生以排斥黑人勞工爲理由，而實行罷工之風潮。即美國衆院前爲懷柔渝方，曾審議修正禁止中國移民法案，但至目前亦告擱淺，且因此反使美國輕視中國之眞相暴露，而陷於啼笑皆非之苦境。美國以友邦爲名，欺騙渝蔣企利用其爲對日之最前綫，渝方乃竟爲其所乘，　監美國爲同盟國而甘受其驅使。但吾人試回溯華僑人美之歷史，乃以一八五〇年時應募赴美加利福尼亞州開採金礦爲始，但未及十年，美國即有排華之舉。其後於一八六八年及一八八〇年經兩度締約，及至一八八二年，美國根據禁止中國移民法而完全關閉其門戶。其排斥亞人運動，於一九〇六年因排斥留學生事件，而致日本移民問題亦告嚴重之前，乃專以華僑爲對象，且因排日足以於太平洋上引起重大問題，而排華則因其時中國政府無力干涉，故乃繼續實行，種種暴行不一而足。甚至有以華僑作其新死刑具之試騐品，而舊金山之「華人街」，美人竟以新奇事物陳列塲視之，並模倣美南部諸州所實施之「禁止雜婚法」，制定禁止美人與蒙古族結婚之法律，視亞人與黑人相等。其至一九一七年一九二四年制定禁止亞洲移民法案，而將中日民族悉拒於美洲大陸之外。時至今日，美國目覩日本對於中國已實行撤廢治外法權交還專管租界等友好措置，深懼其所謂「正義人道」之假面具將因而被揭破，故由當局示意，衆院提出修正禁止中國移民法案之舉，但該案目開始審議以來，反對者仍衆。衆院歸化移民委員會因其將遭否決，而影響於美政對之謀略，故宣告延期表決。至此即昔日深信美人以中國爲友者，亦必謂美人以奴隸視中國矣。至於南非聯邦排印問題，自一八六〇年印度勞工應募赴納塔爾州以來即已開始，蓋英美民族素具優越觀念而歧視有色人種，且因與印人在經濟方面亦發生利害衝突之故，因此而促起印度反英運動之發生，而釀成歷史上之重大問題。英美當此大戰期中竟仍敢倒行逆施，致引起如此重大事件，觀此足證其所具之種族歧視錯誤觀念，實已至冥頑不靈，無可救藥之地步，。美民族爲維持其本身之生存英而對於其他民族極盡侵略欺壓之能事，如英之滅亡印度，發動鴉片戰爭，美之侵夏威夷佔菲律賓，以私刑虐待黑人奴隸等，俱爲確證。英美之如此兇橫無道，其結果無非是掘墳墓而已。故吾人今後必須繼續與彼等作猛烈決戰，俾將其擊滅，蓋除打倒英美以外，我東亞民族則無求生之途，此實爲我東亞全體民族所必須銘證者也。</p>

<h3>日本海海戰與日特蘭海戰（一）</h3>
<p>— 伊藤正德</p>
<p>二十世紀的兩大海戰，一發生於五月二十七日，一發生於五月三十一日。然而一般人都懷疑，將來是否還能看到這樣大規模的海戰，眞成問題，但我認爲仍然有希望可以看到，在這種情形上，來檢討這一日特蘭海戰的歷史意義，我認爲更形重大。</p>
<p>（一）戰術思想與戰法</p>
<p>日俄海戰時日本東鄕元帥在敵人面前八千公尺處展開斷然大胆的決戰，但日德蘭海戰時，英國哲到科（Jellicoe）元帥在距離二萬數千公尺處的遠方展開小心異異的避戰法，二者對照一下，是很有意義的。前者是向殲滅之途勇往邁進，而後者是一味嘗試砲戰的行動，這顯然，其間有極大的戰略計劃之懸殊，也有非常的戰街思想之差別。日本海戰與日特蘭海戰的不同，具體言之，可以說日英兩國統帥對於海戰的有根本觀念在所不同所致。其不　點，則產生於戰術思想，而由統帥完成，我則完成殲滅戰術，彼則坐失良機。</p>
<p>那末展開後的砲戰究竟怎樣呢？東鄕元帥在未達到並航作戰的姿態與有效砲擊射程時，是一面受敵轟擊着而一面等待時機。下午二時十分，航駛至距離敵人六千公尺處，我國全體艦隊（十二艘）一齊開始轟擊。射擊的確達到出神入妙處，二時二十分，敵軍左　前方的戰艦粵斯拉維亞號竟被火焰所籠罩，二時五十分，艦首則下沈而落在戰隊之外（三時二十分沉沒），三時零分，旗艦斯粵羅夫號也被火焰包圍而棄於戰隊之外，司令長官羅哲斯特溫斯基則受重傷，而主力艦隊則交與第二艦亞力山大三世號指揮（全軍指揮移交與奈保葛道夫少將），遭艘第二艦也在三時八分落於戰隊之外，第三艦包羅廷號首先企圖脫逃，三時二十五分，由濛濛雨氣而暫時得以逃脫。</p>
<p>在這約一小時的第一次攻擊當中，東鄕艦隊射出的命中彈，八英寸口徑以上之砲所射出者，共有一百五十發，其中五十發爲最初十分鐘內所射出，這實在　已打破世界海戰的最高紀錄。反囘來，日特蘭海戰究竟怎樣呢？下午六時三十分，英軍主力在一萬二千公尺處向敵人開始轟擊，但當時並無發砲命令，也沒有分配砲火的指令，只是二十四艘艦任意決定目標而開始轟擊的。德國喜亞提督用其拿手好戲囘頭戰法而一氣把英艦擊退，這第一次砲戰只不過是十分鐘。但這十分鐘是十分重要的。在這千鈞一髮的緊要關頭，英軍由於哲利科頒佈十四海里的减低速度令，則混亂成一團，其得以發砲者僅十二艘艦，正爲全艦隊之一半，其中射出命中彈者，愛昻公爵號六發，散得拉號四發，粵賴恩號後愛丁考號各一發，共十二彈。實際上，是射中德國克尼嚇號二發，馬古拉夫號二發，留早尼號三發，德福林格號一發，共八發命中彈。</p>
<p>（二）日本砲擊與英國砲擊</p>
<p>本來擊中的多寡往往以天氣的好壞爲轉移，日特蘭海戰當時的海　霧氣甚濃　妨碍到搖凖，但風浪却很輕微，日本海戰當時則正相反，舷　的六英寸砲幾乎　全在　浪中冲洗着那樣風浪激烈，船的顛簸動搖也比較大。砲的破壞力與裝甲的防禦力比例，則一九〇五年與一九一六年幾乎相等。但日本艦隊當第一次攻擊時，業已取得砲擊的效果，而決定丁戰鬥前途；英國艦隊則相反，僅僅擊毀德艦德福林格號的六英寸口徑砲，擊傷克屯嚇號右舷側，使其傾斜而浸入水中四度半，以後擊碎馬古拉夫號的無綫電機件而已。這若比起東鄕艦隊的砲火威力來，眞是相形見絀。</p>
<p>後來由於接二連三的砲戰，英軍曾與德軍相當大的打擊。這因爲是三十三艘主力艦一齊開火，即使不擋凖的流彈也會收到相當效果。但英艦受到二十一艘德團艦隊的打擊，正如前述那樣厲害，在這一點上比較起日本海的東鄕艦隊，則更有極大優秀懸殊。</p>
<p>下午七時四分至七時二十分間的第二次交綏，英國主力艦的發砲彈數仍然記載於史冊者爲一百二十八發，其中命中彈則僅爲二十九發（未記載者有十五艘艦艇，如把這些艦艇也加上，共發砲彈數可能爲二日五十發左右）。由於英國這樣的砲擊，德艦留早尼號則落於戰隊之外，希波爾戰綫的四艘艦艇則喪失了戰鬥力之大部。當時英軍蒙受的損失很輕，誰都相信砲戰對英軍有利，但這一點比起日本海戰來，也可以發見天壤之差別。</p>
<p>日本海的第二次攻擊，是從四時開始，一時敵人藉濛濛霧氣逃遞，六時第三次搜　而發見即加以猛擊，在這次戰鬥中，曾與敵方新銳戰艦亞力山大三世號以致命打擊，更進而擊沉同一類型的包羅廷號。這就是說，第一日畫戰砲擊，敵方喪失了新銳主力艦五艘中的四艘。這如比較特拉法爾加（Trafalgar）　戰中納爾遜（Nelson）所獲到的戰果高出一倍的日特蘭海戰哲利科之戰果，眞是不能同日而語。</p>
<p>（三）戰術運動上的顯著差別</p>
<p>哲利科的艦隊運動，和東鄕艦隊作一比較是非常有興趣的。東鄕元帥會進行直角戰，二直角戰，或一齊向後轉的囘頭戰等反來復去不下十數次，每當敵人企圖後退逃遁時，則我方艦隊即行追向前去施行接觸，且常常由北利東，或由北和西壓迫敵方前頭艦艇，總而言之，詛　攔擋其逃歸海參威的去路。哲利科正與此相反，而輕易准許德艦向西方的逃避，且對再戰的機動非常遲緩。這一點也是日本海戰與日特爾海戰的不同點。</p>
<p>此外更有興味的比較，是德國喜亞司令長官曾施行三次艦隊的一齊囘頭戰法（六時卅八分退却時，六時五十五分出擊時，七時十七分退却時）竟很巧妙地逃出英軍的轟擊團，但我們東鄕元帥也曾實施過三次同樣一齊囘頭戰法（二時五十六分，三時四十八分，四時三十五分），竟機巧地捉住俄國軍艦。日文中之「一齊囘頭戰法」即德國海軍語「Gefechtskehrtwendung」，是艦隊運動中最出色者。是最重要而且最困難的運動，而英海軍近年來並不實行於主力艦隊內，所以並沒有一個洽當名詞。英國人有時說「Swingaround　maneuver」，有時稱之爲「Simultaneous　wheeling　away」。但哲利科本人在其著作中曾說：「這種運動在大艦隊的情形下，徒引起混亂與危險，所以應當避免這種戰術」，於是竟沒有想到一九一六年五月三十一日，自己的敵人對他却實行過三次。由於自己相信不適合於大艦隊的運動，因而以爲敵人也不會用這種戰術。」</p>
<p>在哲利科的海戰公報中，曾記載着每次　軍囘頭退却時，「因濛濛勝與煤烟面不見了敵人」，但　問運動却一言不提。哲利科知道了這一點時。却是　將喜亞一九二三年　　日特蘭海戰史後的事情。其助手畢提伊提督也未曾曉得這一點。證明這一點，可以看一九二〇年發表的英國海軍省的日特蘭海戰公報中，所刊佈的畢提伊報告，其後面附帶着一張海戰航跡圖，圖中完全沒有提到六時五十五分及七時十七分德軍反轉囘頭的戰法表示，這當然可以說明畢提伊是不知道德軍當時曾實行囘頭戰法的。詳細表示兩軍遲動的航圖中，而把這一點沒有加以記載，這只能證明他們是不知道。畢提伊知道時，也是日特蘭海戰七年後的一九二三年的事吧！英軍失敗於決戰而受到批評這並不是沒有理由的吧！</p>
<p>囘頭來看一下這　運動，即日特蘭海戰十一年前，東鄕提督縱橫於日本海峽所進行的大海戰當中，曾表演過三次（其中一次曾是兩次的連續，所以稱四次也無不可），藉此而把敵人擋住不能使其逃脫，這也就是完成驚天地泣鬼神的殲滅戰之一大原因。哲利科也許會　嚴，他在日特蘭海戰中並未碰到類似這種形狀的運動，日本海戰，即從這種運動的一點來看，其偉大性也是空前的。（濤：譯中央公論六月號）</p>

<h3>保衛歐洲大陸軸心早有充分準備　自義大利至法國南部沿岸築成地中海圍牆堅不可拔</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央電地中海戰局因班泰勒里亞島之　反軸心軍佔領，故已進入新階　，　本土及南歐一帶已感異常緊張。德軍事記者最近曾赴法國南部地中海岸一帶視察，頃已退抵柏林，據談，自義大利至西班牙間之法南部沿岸所謂「地中海圍牆」情形稱：德　最高司令部於法國南部沿岸地帶，爲準備將來所發生之事態，其他各處已講求同樣之萬全措置。德建設隊繼德軍進駐之後，並已至法南部衝「地中海圍牆」此「圍牆」不僅具有防禦性質，且在現在已成爲攻撃地中海敵人重要補給綫之基地。在該處任何一小地點沿岸之防禦力，亦均極爲堅强，各港灣亦已成爲強有力之要塞又在各地似均建有機塲，蓋德方於過去五年間，曾構築潛艇避難所，「大西洋圍牆」及西部要塞等工事，已有相常經騐，故此「地中海圍牆」乃係利用過去之經騐而築者。又因地中海沿岸氣候適宜，且多灣岬及山岳地帶，故工事進展甚爲容易，現在軸心軍於此「圍牆」之背後，巳備有情銳部隊，以防敵人攻擊，採取待機而動之勢云。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　海通社訊：反軸心方面尤其是英方報紙，現正紛紛討論進攻歐洲問題。柏林軍界對之，僅於昨日論稱，「吾人已有準備」。反軸心及中立國方面顯已大感進攻之緊張，但在歐洲中部之軍界方面則絕無此象專家方面認爲此種漠然處之之態度，乃由於在德軍不僅比較沈寂之數月間，已採取各種軍事之措置，且在許久以前，業已有特殊之防衛設施·關於海峽地區及大西洋沿岸於佔領之後，已立即開始作防衛之佈置，而法國南部之鬥戶，亦已於一九四二年十一月間封閉·軍事方面保證稱：「現時歐洲各處可受攻擊之處，皆已裝甲並不斷增强之」云。此閒又獲悉關於此項防衛設施，雖偶有群細之論文發表，但敵國絕不能窺知此項防衛之總力量·關於德方自已之計劃，並無絲毫具體之表現，德方對之亦絕不有疑慮與忽忙之表示。此問軍界顯然相信德國及其軸心盟國之實力，故絕不懷疑在未來之軍事發展中，必將獲勝利之果。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　據此間同盟社訪員稱：歐戰之主要戰事現已由陸地戰爭進而爲空間決戰期。以東綫戰事而言，德蘇空軍現正爲爭取制空權而作殊死戰，在西綫則德英空軍亦盡力發揮威力，地中海方面亦然。軍事觀察家申言現時之空戰已臻頂點，雙方陸海空總動員之決鬥顯巳接近，反軸心陣營現正盡力宣傳其在歐陸數要點登陸攻擊戰事之爲期已近·該訪員續舉數點，反軸心軍無法在歐陸登陸之緣由·自本年五月間大西洋防禦完成以來，由挪威之北首起至南部之畢司凱海灣止，其間之海岸綫無一隙可乘，尤以法國南部海岸幾成爲實際的砲壘錢。反軸心國必須以極大之人力及物資以侵入歐陸，姑不論其船只之損失。軍事觀察家並論及反軸心軍欲發動歐陸攻勢時，必須蘇聯同時在專綫舉行大規模攻勢，而實際上蘇聯並無此項戰鬥力也·該訪員又謂軸心軍已完成一切準備，以抵禦敵方之蠢動。德方最高司令部現正考慮今年無在東綫發動夏季攻勢之必要，僅須消耗蘇軍戰鬥力，以期將來興反軸心軍決戰時之勝利，德方有此戰略，故正致力於佔領區之協調。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　自地中海戰局突吿緊張以後，反軸心軍即屢决宣傳謂將進攻歐洲。德國人民觀察報特於十二日以「自信國力完成萬全準備」爲題，撰論說明德國防衛歐洲大陸之確信。大意謂吾人如漠視當前因難，實屬錯誤，蓋爲爭取最後勝利起見，非克服此種困難不可。敵人曾亟欲沮喪我士氣，但今已顯然失敗，濫行轟炸及滅亡德國國民等之威脅宣傳，反足證明敵人已自知其處境之困難而無法應付戰爭。試檢視地圖，即可知今日之戰局，不可與不九一八年比較，蓋一九一八年當時，係六大國攻德國及其盟軍，但今日則雙方勢均力敵。預料戰後之歐洲大陸，將着手重建工作，其規模之宏大，將爲世界史上所罕有。吾人固知前途困難尚多，但確信若木過去之經騐，以克服當前之各種困難，則吾人之目的，必將於最近之將來可以完成云。</p>
<h3>地中海戰局　現已進入新階段</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電據海通社引英京消息，倫敦官方昨晚宣布：班泰勒里亞南之拉姆培杜薩島義駐軍，已向反軸心軍投誠。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　海通社訊據韋白中尉頃由西西里之加泰尼亞通訊云：班泰勒里亞島面積僅八十三平方哩，以如此小島，竟能抵禦此次之猛烈轟炸，實爲軍事歷史中所　有。該島之英勇防軍包括德軍若干小隊，曾奮勇抵抗敵方海空攻勢至五週之久，徒因缺乏飲料，始被迫於六月十一日停止抵抗。</p>
<p>羅馬十三日中央社電　此間海通社記者昨晚宣稱：班泰勒員一亞　已陷落，羅馬方面現皆預料反軸心軍在最近之將來，即將進攻西西里及撤丁兩島公衆對於業已得之反軸心一切行動，皆從此項觀點以討論之。同時拉姆培杜薩島現時仍山其少數防軍奮勇保衛，班泰勒里亞若非因水告乏，亦或能作較久之抵抗。較大之義國屬島，當不致有此項困難發生，保衛西西里及撒了之計劃業已極詳細規定云。</p>
<p>班島守軍奮戰經過　羅馬十三日中央社電據海通社訊，此間昨晚稱：班泰勒里亞之抗戰，係自五月九日起至六月十一日止，在此三十三日間，該島之駐軍曾有非常英勇之表現，義空軍及高射砲曾擊落英美飛機一百六十二架，消滅反軸心空軍人員的八百人，此外又有反軸心機十六架被德軍戰鬥機擊落，其中八架係於星期四一日之間被擊落者。該島縱的十四公里，橫的八公里，總計面積的八十三萬公里。地勢多屬平坦，僅在海岸附近，有少數髙地可資設防，故該島之防守頗爲困難，在高地之岩石間，有洞穴可爲飛機之屛障，飛機即可在此項洞穴中出發，至其貼鄰之機塲中起飛。該島有此項便利，故一部份空軍曾使用該處爲根據地，但欲發展此根據地則殊非易事·該島之防空，大部仰賴於在鄰近相距僅一百公里之西西里島。義軍界力言即使反軸心軍冀圖在西西里登陸班泰勒里亞島亦無甚重要，蓋馬爾太實爲堅强之海空軍根據地，其距西西里之遠近亦與班泰勒里亞相若，而反軸心軍現時又佔有突尼西亞，故班泰勒里亞島僅爲非洲海岸與馬爾太間微弱之一環而已云。據信該島因遭英美之空襲而毀損後，似不能大加改善以爲根據地之可能，班島以前之重要性，乃因其可供軸心方面用爲空軍及小部份艦隊之根據地，以供爭取西西里海峽之運輸交通，而維持北非德義軍之供應而已·關於班島南面之拉姆培北蕯島命運，羅馬方面亦不存幻想，此間一般見解，以爲讓島絕對孤立，僅有小數守軍，故遲早必屈服於反軸心軍云。義大利日報昨日評論班島之失陷稱，「班島乃義軍抵抗力及作戰精神之典型模範，如敵人企圖自班島北進，必將遭　重大困難。班島曾盡其人事上之能力，以抵抗敵軍之進攻，義軍之抵抗必俟最後之可能錫盡時，方始停止云·論壇報期謂該島抗戰適達六星期，並非如倫敦無綫電所稱僅十三日。該報稱，「班島事件不能阻吾人之繼續作堂皇堅決之戰鬥，無論敵人在何處出現吾人皆將奮力抗戰」云。</p>
<p>英美船艦多艘炸沉　柏林十三日中央社電　德軍事當局於十二日說明德空軍在班泰勒里亞島海面所獲戰果，大意謂德空軍有力新型轟炸機隊，曾於十一日畫夜在西西里海峽及班泰勒里亞島海面轟炸反軸心艦，獲莫大戰果，計炸沉敵八千噸級運輸船一艘，登陸用船十三艘，重創其大型貨船五艘，共計二萬五千噸至三萬噸·此外又震創敵巡洋艦三艘及其他艦艇八艘，內重巡洋艦一艘於被炸後沉沒，又有重巡洋緻及輕巡洋艦各一艘被炸受重創已喪失戰鬥力。</p>
<h3>英美侵略歐陸　主將人選推測</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十三日中央社電據海通社訊：倫敦觀察報外交訪員聲稱：馬歇爾將軍有廣命爲英美征歐聯軍總司令之望，而華維爾將軍則有爲征歐聯軍總參謀長之可能。蓋以總司令一職若由美將任之，則需參謀長必須英將始爲允愜也。</p>
<h3>英陸空兩相　視察北非戰塲</h3>
<p>里斯木十三日中央社電　據北非反軸心總部消息：英國陸軍大臣葛里格爵士及航空在臣辛克萊爵士昨日抵達北非。據駐該處之路透社記者稱：官方並未指出彼等此行有任何特定目的，但彼等大致得參與軍事總部之討論，並或將視察突尼西亞戰塲。在機塲歡迎者有空軍元帥鐵特爾及駐北非公使麥美倫。</p>

<p>瑞典京城十三日中央社電　綜合此間所接消息，東綫蘇軍因連遭敗北，故亟欲一舉挽回頽勢，本月十一日晨即曾在中南部戰綫各地點，同時開始攻勢於强力空軍掩護下，企圖突破德軍陣地，然到處均遭德軍之猛烈反攻，以致蘇軍攻勢計劃復吿崩潰。按是役莫斯科西南方面之蘇軍，首於十一日拂曉在多羅哥布茲及奧勒爾兩地開始玫擊，尤其在奧勒爾方面最爲熾烈，以空軍及砲兵猛攻德軍陣地後，並以强力之步兵部隊欲圖一與奪取德軍前錢要塞，但德軍立即猛烈反擊，於極壯烈之白刃戰後，乃將蘇軍擊退，是役蘇軍損害甚大。同時蘇軍在羅斯托夫西方之苗斯河沿岸方面，亦繼於十二日開始熾烈攻擊，然亦遭德軍猛烈反攻而敗走·又庫彭橋頭堡亞索夫沿岸地區德軍前鋒部隊，會向北方進攻，排除蘇軍抵抗，已進至相當地域云·</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　海通社軍事訪史蒂爾弗萊特將軍宣稱：蘇軍第四次大舉進攻庫喜橋頭德軍陣地失敗後，一週來該區之戰事活動頓行減少，在此第四次攻勢中，蘇軍在克林斯加雅西北之狹小地帶中，計共損失步兵十三師三旅坦克車六大隊及飛機無數。蘇軍雖受此重大損失，而所獲極爲有限，蘇軍曾一度突入德軍陣綫三公里，但未幾即爲德軍反攻所逐退，並毀其坦克車百輛及飛機三五〇架，衆料斯達林旣有奪取諾伏洛西斯克港及泰曼半島以控制寇許海馬峽之決心，今後仍將斷續在軍彭區內進攻幸賴德軍將士之用命，益以空軍之協助，所有蘇軍欲藉登陣戰略以奪取以上各基地之企圖均未獲　。</p>
<h3>對羅斯福呼籲義人置若罔聞</h3>
<p>羅馬十三日中央社電　羅斯福總統曾向義人呼籲，對聯人作某項允諾，求義人將德人驅出利，羅馬政界昨日對海通社稱：「羅斯福之詞，吾人將視爲並不存在，」因此官方或報界對羅氏之詞，不致加以評論，但某有資格之官員對海通社稱，羅斯福爲此項呼籲之時，係在反軸心國已承認不能以其他之方法，尤其是空襲恐怖以使義人屈膝，此誠堪重視。在此時而爲呼籲，足見反軸心之無其他方法，可迫近歐洲堡壘。吾人若將近東　國之榜樣及反軸心國之如以待遇其昔時盟邦法國則對於義大利在羅斯福所造成之國際中，將佔如何地位，實不難想像。無論如何羅斯福何未言及如義大利遵照渠之呼籲，則是否將美國之殖民地全部返還義國羅氏實不能爲此諾言，蓋吾人已深知美國對於北非之意向，亦已知美國對於吾人最久之殖民地厄立特利亞如何處置。羅斯福因曾對美國民衆允諾，不派遺美軍至美洲之外，各人可見羅氏之決心不守其諾言矣。</p>
<h3>西班牙國民黨在羅馬設總部</h3>
<p>羅馬十三日中央社電　斯帝芬尼社訊：西班牙國民黨在羅馬新設之總部，於昨日開幕，參與者有西班牙大使·法西斯黨副幹事·及駐義之德國社黨代表一人。西大使演說力言此次典禮之重要，參與典禮者有西國民黨之黨員及會在西班牙參與內戰之義大利軍團，西大使謂此即表示爲正義而奮鬥之民族間之一種團結，西班牙受其元首佛朗哥將軍之精誠感動而有生氣，元首必將完成其目的云。在典禮結束時，會衆皆爲西班牙及其元首曁義大利及義相歡呼。</p>
<h3>英美機襲德喪失六十一架</h3>

<h3>匈國陸長易人</h3>
<p>布達佩斯十三日中央社電　已匈牙利國防部長那基將軍，已於十二日提出辭職，遺缺由査提大將繼任。按查提新國防部長自一九四二年以來，即在東部戰綫任匈牙利軍總司令官，頗著　績。</p>
<h3>德蘇決戰前夕　蘇聯戰鬥力全貌（二）</h3>
<p>二　德蘇　戰時，有人以爲蘇聯在人的資源遭一點對德國占壓倒的優勢。隨着德蘇戰的進展，人口最稠密的歐洲俄羅斯部分大半喪失之後的今日，這點有加以若干修正的必要。但依蘇聯方　所說，那也究竟祇是「若干」而已。何以言之，依蘇聯的說法，蘇聯自德蘇開戰以來即已陸續把存在於歐俄的重要軍需工業遷至東部，而勞動力也自然跟着這些工業一同遷移。　置於德軍占領地域下的居民，幾僅爲無勞動能力的非戰鬥員之老人和孩意而已、這似與事實不同。據德方的報這，蘇聯居民中積　地和德軍合作者爲數極衆。</p>
<p>蘇聯自第一次五年計劃開始之初，即可實施女子勞慟力的動員，德蘇開戰後，女子勞　力的動員澈底地實行了。據紐約通報的記者斯諾的報吿，女子勞慟力占軍需工業部門全部勞動力的百分之九十。</p>
<p>這斯諾的報吿自然不能據以爲準，但以前女子勞慟力僅動員於除了力不勝任以外的各部門，現在則前所視爲不可能的部門亦有女子勞慟力在工作着，這是可以看出的。</p>
<p>因有這種被女子勞慟者所取代的男子陸續徵集至軍隊而派遣至前綫，故蘇聯方面的主張如僅從人的資源方面看來，蘇聯所占的地位殆無甚變化。</p>
<p>問題是在於兵員的訓練程度和勞動力的練程度。兵員的訓練程度興德軍相差甚遠。觀於紅軍的損害比德軍爲甚的一點，即足資證明，不通這當然不僅依存於紅軍兵員的訓練程度，並也有別的原因存在着，如指揮官的優劣，整個的優劣，及其他等等。自從經過了一年半來的實戰經騐後，蘇聯在這一點上大部分似已改進了。</p>
<p>說到勞慟者的熟練程度，隨　戰爭的長期化而低下，這是在任何國家都可見的現象，未必僅蘇聯爲然。蘇聯當局拚命的從事於熟練勞慟者的養成，想塡補這缺點。各種社會中並又展開着軍需工塲問互相的社會主義競爭，這從增產方面看來，亦是不能看過的一點。</p>
<p>其次是物的資源間題。蘇聯重工業部門工作，機械工業所占的比重據稱爲二五％，這不但超過了歐洲各國、並也　駕於美國之上。蘇聯自德蘇一開戰即首先把工作機械工業逸移至烏拉爾，結果據蘇聯方而的報道，有在於歐俄的全部已遷至東部了。</p>
<p>實際上是否如北，因現在茫無頭緒，故不能確定，但如在冬季戰中所見，戰車和飛機的生產，似未可忽視。英美的援蘇物資，在那種大規模的作戰中，幾如九牛一毛，縱令美國製造的戰車能逃出國潛水艦的通商破壞戰而到達蘇聯，因未附隨着必要的部分品，一旦在戰塲上受有損害，即難於修理，於是不能不把美國製的戰車拿來分解，用其部分品來修理。</p>
<p>所以英美的採蘚物資，並不如他們所宣傳那樣在對德戰中非常得力，反不如德國所說明的，紅軍機械部隊完全是蘚聯自製的出品。遷移至東部的軍需工業，自本年起始上軌道，故蘇　的軍需品生產，至本年秋季時將達最高峯。德國自也不能不拋棄希望的觀測，而採取充分的時應措施吧！</p>
<p>但蘇聯飛機的生產，在質量上都遠落於德軍之後。在制空權的有無直接決定作戰的結果之近代戰上，蘇聯　此點可說大爲不利。</p>
<p>蘇聯飛機生產的落後，半由於輕金屬的不足，而最大的原因訓爲技術不充分。蘇聯現在從奧國招聘大批的製造飛，　有關的技　，努立克展技術的落後，同時並在烏拉爾及比里亞新關許多飛機工塲，傾其全力　事於飛機製造上質地的精良。</p>
<p>三　遂行戰爭的努力上，運輸力的問題有重大關係，德蘇目戰前召開的第十八次全聯邦共產黨代表者會識中，馬倫果夫猛烈地　　蘇聯運輸部門的落後，同時在該會議的決議中，復要求從速解決運輸部門的落後問題。</p>
<p>第十八次黨代表者會議，在今日看來，是因見到德蘇開戰的無可避免而召開的。這會議中特別提出運輪力的問題者，正是以說明動輸力的落後直接　是蘇聯抗戰力的弱點。</p>
<p>本來，運輸部門的落後，可說是蘇聯社會主義建設之弱　。承繼帝俄時代缺乏交如網的蘇聯，雖費了很大的力量建設鐵道而有今日的成績，。但時刻的混亂，貨物運輸的延選，則數見不鮮</p>
<p>德蘇開戰之初，蘇聯遭遇德軍之神速果敢的猛攻而　受重大損害的原因之一，在於這運輸機構的不完備。蘇聯當局此後拚命從事增大動輸部門能力的工作，遲滯軍隊及軍需品運輸的塲合，如崢有懷念的行爲，亦即槍決。自採用這嚴峻的方針後，大見改善，上述情事不復重現。</p>
<p>一九四二年九月十七日第十八期共產主義雜誌載有伊奇流希金所著的論文，題爲「在祖國戰爭諸條件下的蘇聯鐵道員　，說蘇聯鐵道運輸部門完全克服工戰爭的落後，圓滿地履行了所課與的任務。蘇聯各報時常發表的鐵道員因不遂行任務而受槍殺處分的記載，不再發見了。</p>
<p>據稱紅軍在冬季作戰中收復了夏季所喪失的地域的大部分，同時，復着手敷設被德軍澈底破環的　道，蘇聯現正拚命在修復被破壞的鐵遒和道路，這是未來的夏季作戰中無疑是重大的障礙。據穗國新聞社通信的報道，蘇聯必須把德國式的　幅完全改成蘇聯的軌幅，這需很多的勞力與時日。同時我們又不能忽視現在德空軍對蘇聯的鐵道施設加強集中的轟炸。</p>
<p>最後說到蘇聯抗戰力中最重要因素的士氣問題。大家知道自一九三三年希特勒元首執政以來，爲培植國民對納粹德國的增惡心理起見，大大地實行宣傳工作，這似獲復了某程度的成功。一九三九年八月德蘇不侵犯條約成立後，對於納粹的攻撃在表面上是消聲匿跡了。但德蘇一聞戰後，蘇聯宣傳機關的攻擊納粹又如火如茶起來。</p>
<p>蘇聯把德蘇開戰的責仟完全諉諸德國，喚起國民的愛國心，高呼防衛祖國以應付德軍的「侵入」，重又培植國民對納粹德國的增惡心理。這和二十五年來國民之澈底的共產主義敎育相輔以成收獲了很大的成功，而表現於列寗格勒，塞伏斯托波爾，斯　林格勒等的防衛戰中。</p>
<p>靑年層的戰鬥精神更極爲旺盛，他們的史太林崇拜熱達到了白熱化的程度，據蘇聯方面的報道，如有史太林的命令、雖赴死地亦所不辭。一九四二年十月號的慈那米耶雜誌上。揭戰一篇愛伏開尼－伽伏利路維區的中驚小說「在莫斯科近郊」，頗有一談的價值。那篇小說描寫一九四一年秋的在莫斯科附近紅軍的戰門情形，有各種各樣紅軍兵士在小說中登塲，足以激發讀者的士氣，其宣傳價值可說是百分之百。</p>
<p>蘇聯當局一面濫發列寗勳章和「蔽聯英雄」的稱號，以鼓舞國民的士氣，一面並稱前綫將士爲「親衛隊」，制定果托査夫，斯伏洛夫，納夫司基三種勳章，以激勵紅軍的戰鬥精神。</p>
<p>總之，蘇聯國民的士氣，隨着德蘇戰的進展，而愈加旺盛起來，史太林政權也毫無發生破綻之兆。紅軍的軍事評論家，每有機會，率直地承認紅軍的作戰機動比德軍爲劣，用旺盛的士氣來補救這弱點，並嚴爲振肅軍紀。惟蘇聯的士氣無論如何旺盛，在純軍事作戰上，蘇聯難於進展，是不能掩蔽的事實。（翔：自、「俄羅斯月刊』五月號）</p>

<h3>黃媽</h3>
<p>— 馮大文</p>
<p>黃媽是這弄堂二十四號裏的一個女傭，年紀不不過四十多歲，但頭髮却已斑白了，她有着一付溫厚的面容，可是在舉動方面却隨时表示出一个很能幹的樣子。她跟隨她主人已有八九年了，誠實·忠厚·和氣是她的特點，對每個人都合得來，所以說起她，差不多全弄堂的人都知道—而且知道她是個好人。</p>
<p>她很忙碌，每天—就是嚴寒的天氣、早晨四點鐘，就要起身了，接着生煤爐，揩　，抹凳……手足不停地做到晚上，還要侍候太太們打牌。不會有一刻休息的時間，而每個月的工資，雖然一加再加，到現在還只有十塊錢；但她沒有怨言，總怪她自己的命運不濟。爲了希望將來能過得舒服點，所以她要多做點好事—這　更使得她好人出了名。</p>
<p>她是杭州人，　她丈失早已在十多年前死去了，曾留下一個兒子，戰前在一家布店裏做　學徒的，後來因爲戰事的發生　而失蹤了，一直到現在還沒有囘來，不然到今年已有二十三歲了，這件事曾經使得黃媽哭了幾日幾夜；至今還一直吊在心頭上，常常會引起她的眼淚，她希望她兒子能安然的囘來，一面可以接替黃家的香烟頭，另外却可使她好好地享點兒福。所以她常常幻想着快樂，夢想到天國樂園。</p>
<p>但是，「坐着等，那裏會送上門來呢！總要自己努力呀」，這個眞理突然給他發現了、以後她就開始努力起來。</p>
<p>她下了一番研究功夫，覺得要快樂幸福，第一總得要有錢，東家的工錢，連得用都不夠，積一輩子也積不起來，總要想點發財的方法。於是，她時常留心着馬路上有沒有人家落掉的　錢袋或其他的東西，可使她能發些小財。結果却失望了，於是她不得不改變下方式，另外想法子。</p>
<p>果然，她找到了可以發大財的工具—慈善獎券；她第一次聽、到頭獎有五十萬的時候，她覺得她已發現了發財的捷徑、開心得好像已是中了頭獎一樣。繼續着去探聽每張的價格，她便開始去買了一張，特地用了一塊烏黑的手帕包了起來，放在貼肉的一件布衫口袋裏，又用了引綫把袋口縫了起來。</p>
<p>「嚇—這裏恐怕有五十萬塊錢呢，不要把牠丟掉—」</p>
<p>她盤算着：「假使中了頭獎，不，假使是二獎，那也蠻好了！我一定獨自去租個　前樓住住，這獨養兒子，也總要　設法去找囘來的，再有這套小衫　褲破得連補也補不成了，想要做　套新的。平常總要用得省一點，這筆數目也可用到了老，還有壽衣和壽器，也可以預先買好了。」</p>
<p>初九開獎，她已記得爛熟。初一·初二，初三…她心這樣急，而時間却相反地過得這樣慢。</p>
<p>在初九那天，一早她就睡不着了，一心的在等　候五十萬元的頭獎。便特地費了七角錢，買了一份申報，請弄堂口的拆字先生去査査看。</p>
<p>「沒有！」</p>
<p>「眞的沒有？述得二獎三獎也沒有中吧？」她不相信、再拿囘家去，請東家的阿官査了又査。但是結果，又是：「沒有！」</p>
<p>她並不因之而灰心，以後應省吃儉用、每月在工錢中抽出兩塊錢來多買幾次，總可着的。這樣她差不多買了有半年多，但是一次他沒中，竟連得末尾也與她沒緣，數數保存着的舊獎券倒已有五張了。</p>
<p>「亭！這是騙人的東西，難道眞的一次都不會中嗎？下次死也不買了。」</p>
<p>一個晴朗的早晨，大約只有七點半鐘左右，黃媽提　了小菜籃，向東家拿了十塊錢，朝小菜塲走去：在安南路的轉角上，聚着一堆人，她帶着好奇心走過去。是一儷賭攤，她就立定了脚、看見站在她對面的一個人、拿出了五塊錢，押下去，立刻變成了十元；又變成了二十元。</p>
<p>錢！錢在引誘她！「這不是一個可發財的好方法嗎！」</p>
<p>她便很爽快地伸手拿出十塊錢來、往上一押，果然成了二十塊錢、她預備囘身走了，但是站在她旁邊的一個人綳緊着臉，攔住了她的去路，「再押！一定可以述中！」</p>
<p>「好！再押一次吧！」她想索興再多贏點。</p>
<p>但是，這次沒有像上次的順利了。二十塊錢都溜入那莊生的手中，她身子抖了一下，很不捨的看看那二十塊錢。她又從自己袋裏摸出已積蓄了許多時候，只有這麽一張的十塊錢，再把牠一押，她肚裏念了一句「阿彌陀佛」，暗暗地在祈禱。但是菩薩那裏有靈，會去幫　忙呢——又輸了！</p>
<p>她走了開去，身上已沒有半　錢，小菜也買不成了，於是不得不走到一個朋友家裏，借了二十塊錢，預備再去買小菜。</p>
<p>可是走過的時候，看　那賭攤，不禁又眼熱起來，想把剛才輪掉的錢，翻本　來，她決定再押一下。起先她等待了一會，注視了一下幾次開出來的數目，便鄭重地把二十塊錢又放下去；心中被紛　的思想繞迥着，只有在等待對命運的裁判。</p>
<p>「吃！」不幸得很，竟又輸掉了，</p>
<p>她眼前呈現了一片糢糊、身體開始不自主的顫動起來。四十元！一個多麼大的數目！牠整整的是四個月的工資——　　算了一下，每天機械式的生活，已足夠使她痛苦了，　爲了這四十塊錢，要多做四個月；她想起來可怕，四個月需要每一天像牛馬似的工作！</p>
<p>在平日，她任何的一切都承受着，覺得只要忍耐下去，前面的光明是會到來的！如今，她失望了，更想起她失去了的兒子；在這一世，整個的一世，是不會有什麽希望了！</p>
<p>「活着幹什麽呢？」她不禁發出了這一個懷疑！</p>
<p>囘到家裏，把空空的菜籃向桌上一放，走到　臺上，找了一根繩子出來，扣在竹竿上，不遲疑的向頭上一套，結束了她的生活。</p>
<h3>信仰</h3>
<p>— 萬里</p>
<p>——獻給祥哥——信仰，堅持偉大的信仰！狂濤大海中的孤島，會生長燦爛底花果，絕無人跡的原野，能產生豐茂　　寶。荊棘，黑略，魑魅，　　不要怕！信仰是無敵的！成功—信仰的孩子，在人生旅途上，長途底跋涉，有信仰的人，像戰塲上馳騁着忠勇的騎士，爲了人間的正義，博鬥　惡魔！創造新的光明！猶豫—信仰的敵人。別丟棄了偉　的，應負的任務　而孤獨地虛度着，寶貴的歲月。長期地奮鬥！努力地工作！時間要寶貴她！每一分鐘，有每一分鐘的事蹟！別爲光陰的易逝。惆悵着，已失去的過去！努力—信仰的工具。活着好好地，做個有用的人！失望，困難，彷徨，寂寞，努力地解放這失敗底要素！堅信咱們底力量上帝創造不了偉大底巨匠。信仰啓示着驅使着我們，走上光明底大路，有信仰的人，迷不了途！有信仰的人、是世界上最快樂的人！</p>
<h3>幻想中的歡樂</h3>
<p>— 胡明揚</p>
<p>這不是一個春天嗎？</p>
<p>一切都是這般的美麗。</p>
<p>讓我們漫步在春的原野上，</p>
<p>暫且沉醉在春風裏。</p>
<p>我們見世界在我們身旁毀了，</p>
<p>光陰在我們的周圍消逝。</p>
<p>這時空於我們是無關，</p>
<p>我們對於這時空是無知。</p>
<p>我們是幽閒地在漫步，</p>
<p>迷茫地在歡樂，</p>
<p>這意境是這般地糢糊：</p>
<p>可是誰美化了這一切？</p>
<p>「一種說不出的情緒。」</p>
<h3>小樓書簡</h3>
<p>— 烟萍</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>朋友：窗外下着凄風苦雨，我的心也給揉成亂糟一片，我悶得喘不過氣來，我想向你傾訢，傾訴那無上的哀痛，我想哭；哭那可慘的人生、忍住一切聽我幾句話吧！你知道我們教室的窗正對着太平間，每當敎授上課時常遇到悲哀的節奏，尤其今天，我永忘不了的一個情景，當生物先生在講如何解決『生命之謎』，突然一個慘然的長號，朋友，你永不會想到這長號是如何的悲慘、我們全敎室都怔住了，我的心弦振起一陣的微波，我向窗外望，是的、我看到這樣的畫面：太平間的門前停着一輛殯儀館的汽車和一輛載有屍盒脚踏車，一個襤褸的老婦掩面痛哭、旁邊有二個西裝靑年却在悠然踱步，二具屍體被抬出來了，一具放上了汽車，接着二個靑年也跟了上去，車飛馳而去，還有一具被放進了屍盒，只有那老婦人孤單單的坐在黃包車上長號跟隨着　是這樣簡單一幕，朋友！或者你認爲是太平凡的事吧，可是我記起陀夫退夫斯基的「窮人」，我茫然的直到下課，我磨滅不了這一個景象，風雨更大了，朋友，你能確確實實告訴我生命之謎呢？</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>朋友：一個生活空虛的人的心是如何的痛苦，我飲着一杯杯苦酒，淚流上了臉類，可不知什麽時候才能完盡呢？你說我病了，但我不知什麼叫做病，我每天在病房門前徘徊，想探求病是什麼。當我站在神經病院的門口，忽然裏面衡出一個披髪的婦人，她瞪着我直看，她的頭髪掩了她的臉，她的身材風韻還能　顯出她的美麗、她拉住我的手，「哈哈！莫做起碼人，哈哈，死得窮不得…」我驚得愕住了，我神志有些發昏，直到看護拉開　她爲止，她是瘋人，可是朋友！我却在這瘋人的靈魂裏，瞧透了　是純潔的至高無上人類的眞心，你說世界上虛僞的臉就是淸醒嗎？如果眞是這般，那我願做瘋子，我願進病院，朋友！請你告訢我吧。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>朋友：大風雨還是下着，苦惱在我心上壓著，它簡直要把我　碎，昨兒我一人奔到　外灘，在碼頭上我　江風吹　，想吹醒我自已。一只貨船靠徬着，起重機的　　　着，一包包的貨物　到碼頭上「亨育！亨育！碼頭工人爭扎的臉；可是我發現一個老人，他是那麽瘦弱，身體索索抖着、　子在他枯骨　　的肩上　，他慘白的臉上露出紅暈，但朋友！多麽可怕的一幕啊！血突然在他口中噴出來，汗蓋上了他前額，他在　子下倒了下去，貨物壓上他的胸，現在他的臉變得如此靑白可怕，突出的眼珠瞪着人，血流漸了他嘴角，他靜靜躺在路角，另一個年靑夥子　代上了他，一個拿　的人望了一眼，亨了一聲「自不量力…」他雖然抬上了救護車］可是：朋友！你能想想這可悲一慕嗎？我是發狂的奔囘來，但那枯瘦有汗血的臉。……朋友！人生再有這樣悲哀的嗎？</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>朋友：我再吿訢一個碼頭上同時發生的故事吧！一個粗樸黨黑臉的和一個同伴，合檟着一包貨物，當走近取籖的出口處時突然一陣「拍拍！」的毆打聲，我看到一只手，手抓被了棉花包，抓着白的向懷裏藏，汗在他額上流，可是他身上是棉短襖，現在籤子臨到他身上，布衫被剝了，裏面一團團的棉花，「拍拍！」肌肉起了一條條紫黑、他本然無表情的臉、忍受着一切、當一脚踢上他身體，喝一聲「滾」的時候！他似乎淸醒了，淚在他眼裏流出來「先生！我下次再不，幫幫忙饒了我」可是無表情的不眯，他哀求，他的足下跪了「我家裏還有老母妻兒……」「滾」一聲呼叱，他無望的立起來，露着可憐神色，拖着滯緩的脚步，向他的同伴們望了一眼，歎口氣走出了碼頭，一個頽然的身影消失了，朋友！我的淚是那麼多，充滿了眼眶，我想問你人生是奮鬥的眞理呢！</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>朋友：黑夜吞滅了一切，黯淡的街燈，我默默的在暗角裏走，突然：「先生！我們姑娘還年輕，你幫幫忙吧！」我囘過頭來發現了那鴇婆向那夜鶯狠狠的目光，於是一只瘦小的手，「先生……」這斷續間包拈了多少可想的話語，我的心生了戰慄，我瞧了她的眼，眼裏充滿着淚，閃閃的睫毛，乞援的顏色，我自尊堅强自己，掙脫了向前，」唉！」遙遠的傳來一聲歏息。</p>
<p>朋友！你知道我心裏的難過是如何呢？在那兒或者有無數聖潔的靈魂，被壓迫的嘴臉，巨大桎梏來縛着她們，沒有扎掙，沒有反抗，只是忍受的吞着淚水，等待人們的宰割，她們裝笑，用自已的手永遠的在拉啊拉的，什麼時候可以不飲這苦酒呢？什麽時候可以得到解放呢？她們永　熓毒摧殘她們的生命，不受人憐，不受人愛，她們是爲人不恥的夜鶯，永遠生活在另一世界裏，朋友！人生永遠在不同世界裏嗎？</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>朋友：兩天寥寂中。我喜歡聽故事，昨夜，我聽了這麼一個故事，　野是光秃禿的，沒有樹木，沒有靑草，土都龜裂了，無數的人，伸着手，在　號，在掙扎，樹皮，草根，觀音土，…死尸的肉！一個個枯瘦，浮　，倒斃，……搶了人家的孩子，閉戶就烹而食，或者換上了一個，……原野裏是枯骨，是鬼是……可食的食完了，於是不毛之中，升手向天……朋友！我們的眼前至少還有大餅油條！窗外似乎有無數的鬼魂在向我們號呌……</p>
<h3>路工之歌</h3>
<p>— 胡若流</p>
<p>負起了偉大的使命，我們是勞動的一羣；不怕艱難，不辭辛苦，我們要築完這一條大路。祟山峻嶺我不怕！大川細流我不懼！我們的使命爲人類服務，爲大衆勞動。風起了！呼呼的聲音，像鼓勵我們向前進。下雨了！滴滴的雨水，爲我們洗盡身上的汗跡。我們感謝蒼天的厚意。我們要沉靜地，堅耐她，勇敢地，向着目標前進…………路，是那麽的悠長！人，是那麽的辛勞！前人朱築完大路，就跑走了！留下來的，靠我們年靑一代去繼任。我們接受寶貴的禮物，爲人類爲大衆我們要向前進！開通一條光明幸福的途徑。</p>
<h3>信筆話「酒」</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>不善飲的人滴酒入口便要皺眉，好似吃苦藥。嗜酒的人則以飲酒爲人生最大樂趣，眞是奇怪。但欽酒究有何種樂趣，沒有人能說得出來，晉書：「孟嘉爲桓溫參車、好酬飲，溫問酒有何好，而卿嗜之？答曰：公未得酒中趣耳」大賣關子，沒有說出究竟來。白居易有詩云：「更待菊黃佳釀熟，與君一醉一陶然。」魏文帝與吳質書云：「酒酣耳熱，仰面賦詩，當此之時，不自知其樂也。」還沒有說出究竟來。</p>
<p>大約飲酒可以消愁解慮，忘却一切，即是「酒中趣」也。自居易詩云：『俗號消愁藥（即指酒），神速無以加，一杯驅世慮，爾杯反天和，三杯既酩酊，或笑或狂歌，陶陶復兀兀，吾孰知其他？』有此功効，因此失意的人多半嗜酒，李白詩云：「與爾同消萬古愁。』正所謂借酒澆愁是也。你聽，陳喧與兄子秀君云：「吾旣寂寞當世，杇病殘年，產不異于顏原，名未動于卿相，若不飲醇酒，復欲安歸？」十足的是借酒澆愁也。陶淵明不願爲五斗米折腰，掛冠歸鄉，作歸去來辭，中有云：「携幼入室，有酒盈樽，引壺餳以自酌，眄庭柯以怡顏」索興過閒情逸致的生活，共有詩云：「何以稱我情，濁酒且自陶、千載非所知，聊以永今朝。」可見滿腹牢騷，盡向杯中洩了。</p>
<p>文人輿多酒結不解緣，大約酒能刺戟神經，興奮「烟絲披里人』（Inspiration　）的緣故。最豪飲的是詩人李白，據杜詩云：「李白一斗詩百篇，長安市上酒家眠，天子呼來不上船，自稱巨是酒中仙。」據傳太白在輸林，代草王言，然性嗜酒、多沈飲，有時詔令選逑，方在醉中，不可待，左右以水沃面、稍醒，即令秉筆，頃之而成、帝甚才之。酒醉到如此地步，古今只此一人。但終因酒醉冒犯了高力士，晦運開始，過下半生潦倒流浪的生活，寫下了那些好詩：「處世若大夢，胡爲勞其生，所以終日醉，頽然臥前楹。』「花間一壺酒，獨斟無相親，舉杯邀明月，對影成三人。』是多麽動人的酒底詩境呀。</p>
<p>多才多藝的東坡居士，也是愛酒的。詞中話酒的地方很多、其南歌子詞云：「卯酒醒還困，仙村夢不成……帶酒衡山雨，和衣睡晚淸，不知鐘鼓報天明，夢裏栩熱胡蝶一身輕……」多夠味兒、要是酒後必有此味，誰都願意乾幾杯兒吧，</p>
<p>今人喝酒、只知猜拳一種玩意兒，古人歡喜酒令，因太斯文，故小能普遍。據宋張邦基撰器莊漫錄所載，「飲席刻木爲人，而銳其下，置之盤中，左右欹側如舞狀，力盡乃倒，視其傳　所至，酬之陶以杯，謂之勸酒胡。』此則已絕跡于今日了。明宗儀編撰的輟耕錄中，更有一段風流記載：『楊鐵崖眈好聲色，每于筵間見歌兒舞女，有　足　小者，則脫其鞋載盞以行酒，謂之金蓮杯。」三寸金蓮穿着繡花之鞋，在現代人看來，已覺甚少美感，拿來常酒杯以行酒，朱免令人作嘔。不知今日的舞迷，也會將舞女的高跟鞋兒拿來行酒否？</p>
<p>據傳古時以熓（鳥名）毛製酒，名爲鳩酒，奇毒。許多忠臣烈士失敗時即以此自殺的。但據說也有一種欽後不死之酒，據傳從前君山上之酒香山，有美酒，喝了可以不死，于是打動了漢武帝底心，便令藥巴去求取，結果自然辦到，但是在進御之前却被妙人東方朔偷吃了，武帝大怒，便要殺他，妙人從容地說道：「使酒有騐，殺臣亦不死；無騐，安用酒爲？』說得多幽默！弄得武帝哭笑不得。東方朔字曼倩，武帝時爲金馬門侍中，語語有異趣，常以幽默口吻　諫武帝。愚蠢　私的皇帝，有時確非幽默如曼倩者，不足以糾正共錯誤的。</p>
<p>關於飲酒，還有幾個奇異的故事，原載太平廣記：元戴不飲，鼻聞氣已醉，後遇異人，以針挑其鼻尖，出一小虫，曰：此酒究也，是日遂飲一斗。又唐中拾遺載：焦遂（善飲酒，，被稱爲飲中八仙之一）口吃，對客不能出一言，醉後酬答如注，時目爲酒吃。還有唐名書家張旭，嗜酒，大醉之後，呼叫狂走，然後下筆，寫得龍飛鳳舞，後人稱他爲草聖哩。</p>
<p>我總以爲喝酒是一件風雅或潦倒的玩意兒，要是你自鳴淸高，自以爲是詩人雅士，否則，至少也得自以爲是像虬髯客或武松石芳一流的英雄好漢，那你便得學習飲酒一飲數斗，酩酊大醉。通常一個人如　用淸醒的頭腦爲圍家社會做一番事業，便不應與醉酒爲伍。你得明白，酒精富麻醉性，飲後神經被刺激，加速血液的循環，于是發生不自主的興奮，成事不足，敗事有餘。有人以爲借酒澆愁，其實是暫時的，淸醒以後倍覺悲戚，益發雖受。酒精又富筏蝕性，飲後胃壁血管盡被侵蝕，浸在酒精中，于是細胞發脹，久之便要中毒，並使血管硬化，受害不淺哩。</p>
<p>讓我們　詩古今文人關於酒醉的詩文吧，倒可以欣賞那詩意底酒味，已　是很夠味了，又何必要喝得酩酊大醉，像一個酒鬼呢。</p>

<h3>各小銀行的整理問題</h3>
<p>國民政府對於金融統制政策，最近不遺餘力的積極推進，先將票據交換的機構移交於儲備銀行接瞥，以完成名實相符的中央銀行，使之增加威信。今次又將小銀行整理問題，作具體對策的研究，這在國府金融政策的推進上，實爲可喜的事情。</p>
<p>國府對小銀行的處理，據一般傳說，銀行資本額須在三百萬元以上，俾得充實銀行內容，遠在整理工作上，是有相當效果的。以今日的物價情形而言，百萬乃至二百萬之資本，實在未能發探銀行的機能，國府當局注意實行增加資本，確爲當然的措置。</p>
<p>不過，資本金增加後，認爲小齦行內容就可急速的好轉，這就未免有些錯誤，須知增加資本，不過對策的第一步，其重要問題，還在如何使銀行業務正常化，而發揮銀行本來的機能，增加資本之事，尚非大難，倘然增加資本後而經營變態的業務，則將更多一層複雜困難，是以我人對此，不能不特別審愼。</p>
<p>由於這樣的觀點，倘然完全以銀行資本額的大小來作標準，在事實上並不最爲適當，不如從存款內容來作精密觀察，比較是有效果，這在整理銀行的對策上，值得注意，同時也就是對於國府推行金融政策上，有進一步的期待。</p>
<p>小銀行的整理問題，在實施上定有許多困難複雜，我們希望國府當局，用最大的然情和努力來克制，前途當可順利協調，此事除了厚望於國府的積極進行外，更希望金融界能自肅協助，以期獲得切實的效果。（譯自六月十三日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>交通銀行　辦理投資農村放款　請政府供給基金予以特許專辦權</h3>
<p>交通銀行奉令舉辦農村貨款，業經於本年五月五日在行內添設農業經濟處，專資辦理農業金融業務，根據第一次調查蘇浙皖三省及京滬兩特別市各縣農村經濟狀況結果，指定農業金融業務方針：（一）改善農村經濟狀況，（二）增加農業生產量，並協助農業推進與推廣。（三）輔導農民樹立自營自享之金融制度與金融機構。（四）扶掖樹立自耕農。現正依據方針，逐步積極進行，並在初步開始辦理時，擬先着事於農村信用及生產合作放款，中央社記者爲明瞭該行辦理農貸實際程度起見，特向該行農業經濟處探悉詳情，分誌如下：</p>
<p>籌設四處管理投資</p>
<p>該行自成立農業經濟處後，對於農村放款，原以合作社爲對象，因調查各地農村以前所有之合作社，均已解放，故決定在各地合作社未有健全組織之前，派員前往南京蘇北之東台，安徽之蕪湖，浙江之嘉興，籌設農業經濟辦事處，辦理投資農村放款事宜，每一辦事處，管轄三縣至四縣之放款業務，並限於二個月內，務須籌備成立。</p>
<p>開始投資企業貸款</p>
<p>該行最近接受上海附近，及蘇北朁無錫等各地之農業機關要求，先行辦理棉花商種貸款，養豬貸款，農藝貸款，製造農具貸款，農田經營等各種企業貸款，經派員作第二次實地調査後，認爲目前急需資金調劑，故已准予放款，總額一千二百萬元，開始放款矣。</p>
<p>請求特許專辦農貸</p>
<p>該行爲推進農業經濟政策，及完成樹立農村金融制度與機構之使命起見，特呈准政府，（一）特許專辦農業金　業務，（二）供給基金，（三）補償純損，聞該行此次擬請政府給予特許一家專辦農業金融業務等權之意旨，乃爲適應政府實施戰時經濟政策綱領，積極增加生產，進而輔導中央農民機關，樹立各縣市合作金庫，故該行舉辦農業金融業務，與普通一般業務不同，不以營利爲目的，至連日所傳各行莊舉辦農村貸款銀團以交通銀行爲重心一節，完全與事實相反，該行當局，加以否認云</p>
<h3>行荘存款準備金　准予貼現辦法</h3>
<p>銀錢兩業同業公會，爲調劑同業金融，與中央儲備銀行商妥，各行莊所繳存款籌備金，准予作爲貼現担保品，由同業公會保證，得向中央儲備銀行申請貼現週轉後，茲探得貼現辦法如下：（一）存款準備金之作爲貼現担保品，應以全部繳存現金之各行莊爲限。共以四六成現金代替品者，不在此例。（二）貼現數額以所繳準備金之八折爲最高限度，（三）暫以各該行莊七天期本票申請貼現，（四）各行莊申請貼現應由同業公會分別具函證明，是項借款確爲接濟臨時頭寸之用，不得藉此流爲其他囤積或助長投機等用途。</p>
<p>凖備金已解足</p>
<p>各行莊依照管理金融機關暫行辦法及施行細則，將存款準備金繳解與中央儲備銀行所開之準備帳戶，（一）定期存款及特種活期存款百分之五以上，（二）活期存款百分之十以上，前項各種存款，依照每月末日結存額，核定其支付準備金，應於每次月之末日前行之。自今年六月份起，不論定期特種活期以及活期存款凖備金，均已依照法令全部繳解淸楚。</p>
<p>辦理半年結算</p>
<p>銀錢業各行荘，已定六月三十日辦理上半年度結算，將依照法令於每屆營業年度終了時，限於三個月內編製營業報吿書，資產負債表，財產目錄及損益計算書，呈報中央儲備銀行，轉送財政部，頃各行莊均已準備辦理上半年度結算，對於六成到期之款，分別催歸，各業收買農產品等貸放，仍予通融辦理，惟承借人應提出保證，以免助長投機囤積云。</p>
<h3>市民消費合作社　明日截止徵股</h3>
<p>本市各界曁金融工商業領袖，鍳於百物頻漲，生活維艱，爰經發起籌設「上海市民消費合作社」。以便採集大宗主要物品，按期配給各該社員應用，自開始徴股以還，刻已達四萬股左右。並經指定中國銀行，及上海銀行代收股款今該社爲力求迅速起見，特分發通知書於各社員，以便繳付社金，昨悉該社入股，決於明日（十五日）截止，務希各界於今明兩日內辦理入社手續。</p>

<h3>改進滬郊農民生活的意見</h3>
<p>— 馬經農</p>
<p>農民生活是國民經濟的主要部份，農民生活的健全與吾足以影響國家民族的强弱，在戰禍波及世界各國的今日、世界各國政府對於農民生活的關切和改進都遠勝我國數倍：因爲農民生活的安定和農品生產的遞增或减低，都直接反應了一國戰時的粉食政策。所以改進農民生活也　是經濟問題之一，爲了支持長期作戰的需要，我們更應常把關切農民生活相研究農村經濟在經濟界中展開廣泛的探討。</p>
<p>在戰前，上海四郊的農民生活人部份是依附着都市而存在着，因爲人口密集而土地不夠耕種所以很多的農民進了工廠或者是參加了各種生產事業，婦女方而也利用了剩餘的時間兼做了許多副業，簡言之：上海四郊的農民因爲沒有充分的土地耕種，除了種植些菜蔬雜糧或花菓等外，十之八九都沒有自足自給的能力，戰事發生以後，因各工廠相繼停閉和都市生活的劇烈變動，所以直把影響了他們的生活，使他們本身的弱點暴露無遺，尤以最近一二年以內，四郊農民生活的苦難與前途的危機更是不堪設想，以筆者見聞所及，提出幾點意見，聊供當局，或經濟界領袖對於改進農民生活的參考。</p>
<p>（一）嚴厲限制土地賣買：四郊雖然有許多農民感覺到土地的不夠耕種，但是擁有千百畝的地皮商也不乏其人，因爲土地的可貴，所以許多地產公司對於土地的賣買以及各該常地的田主或地皮掮客，都經營着土地的賣買，在這樣　度的變動下，以土地謀生活的農民都受害匪淺，因此他們都在終日不安定生活中，按土地的賣買均須經過鄉鎭長及土地局的證明才能發生効力，然而現在很多非法賣買或發生糾紛甚至直接影響農民生活的事件（如田主易換而增加租金等）却不勝枚舉，爲了制止土地的非法賣買和安定農民生活計”希望當局以嚴厲的辦法來限制土地的賣買和公佈實施的方針來，否則，四郊農民生活的用途甚爲可盧。</p>
<p>（二）舉辦產銷合作機構：中國農品的生產與銷售原是沒有組機構的，在過去雖然已有着不可摧毀的傳統，但是受了多年的戰事影響和許多難以　調和的困難，所以需要當局予以極大的力量來改善原有的產銷機構變成一種合作形式的機構，在產的方面儘量利用現有的許多農塲裏的農業專門人才專司　指導改良耕種改良種籽或者改良畜牧和菜蔬等，各種農事，俾求增加生產，在銷的方面不但改良經紀人的多方面剝削，而且應當由負責銷售的方面來採購種籽採購肥料採購農具來供給農民，求產與銷的合作，這樣既可减少了農民對於採購種子和採購肥料的困難，而且還可减低了農產品的售價，這件事雖然知易行難，但是它的重要是不可諱言的。</p>
<p>（三）溶通河流及廢除各種不必要的墓塚，上海四郊很少是流通的河道，所以除了幾條較流通的河道外，大部份都是些淤塞的溝渠，在雨水均勻的時候，農田的灌溉還能應付、一旦雨水太多　如蘊藻浜兩岸，就氾灆得幾成水災，或是早年的時候如虹橋一帶唱就乾得連食水都沒處吸取，去年的旱荒與蔬菜的資昂就是明證，這一點希望於市政常局進行調査四郊河道之流通情形後予以濬通，以利農用之灌溉。四郊士地既己不　耕種，然而中國人保持墓塚之傳統勝於生活的飢餓，假使把四郊各地的公菜義塚等所佔據的士地計算起來改以耕種的話。也許可以維持幾千家農民的生活，因此，如能堅決廢除各種不必要的墓塚而租給農民耕種，我想這不是沒有意義的一件事吧</p>
<p>（四）增加義務農熟：上海雖然是一個文化最發達的都市，但是在這上海的四郊，文盲的數量眞是使人駭聞，據筆者所知：在江灣鎭北面楊行以南的某些村集中原有二三百個兒童可以受敎育，但是因爲缺乏公立小學或因經濟的貧困，因此能夠受到教育的兒童祇有三四十個，當局既已微收田畝捐，那末，坐視很多兒童失學想亦不忍，（在四郊各村有同樣失學的兒童當然還多着）爲了掃除文盲爲了普及教靑，增加義務農塾或利用各村集中的茶館來開辦各種富於敎育性的演講，實在是急不容綏的事。</p>
<p>四郊各鎭，雖然已經舉辦了食糧的配給，但是像虹橋鎭等各地還沒有得到這樣的配給，所以那地農民的生活更苦於別處，除此以外，如日用品的配給和肥料的供應等都希望賢明的市政當局加以親切的關懷和給以改進。</p>
<p>上海四郊的農民在極度苦難中生活着，盼望賢明和仁慈的市政當局擇尤改進救千百萬農民於水深火熱中。（移酬貸學金）</p>
<p>大衆生活</p>
<h3>工讀生的生活</h3>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>工讀生的苦讀精神往往被人們稱贊，但他們的生活郤是再痛苦也沒有的。</p>
<p>我們三個窮學生在開學的時候請求校方免掉些學費，學校竟答應全部可免，但要我們在附屬小學裏担任點課。學費可以一個錢不出，而教書又是神聖的事，我們都毫不遲疑的答應下來，做了工讀生。</p>
<p>中學和小學都祗上半天課。上午自己唸書，下午敎小學生們。每天有四節或五節課，接連地上，沒有休息的時間；學生一班有六七十個，上課時簡直要變嘶力竭的叫喊，上完了課的時候當然是疲乏得不堪了，但總還得挾了一大疊的作文簿或算學練習本囘家。</p>
<p>起初是沒有報酬的——不，免了的學費就是報酬，過了些時候，由於再三的請求答應供給我們一頓起碼午餐，因爲囘到家裏去吃飯再趕到校裏上課往往來不及；另外校方還體恤我們的痛苦貼二十塊錢一個月，但事務也跟着來了；我們要替學校裏抄講義，（印了要學生出錢買的）考試過後替同學們結算分數。（照每星期課程多少的百分率算總平均成績（我們的工作鄧是極繁重的、而抄寫和算分數更不能有一點疏忽。我們被一種責任心驅使着，始終沒有怠情過一刻兒。</p>
<p>我們的工作是和小學教師一樣繁重——少上幾節課，但添了旁的工作。不過把我們的待愚和窮苦的小學敎師一比，還差得很遠，我們终究還是學生，沒有家庭的负擔。</p>
<p>校長先生怕我們再有什麽請求，再三保證替我們解決下學期求學問題，並且還不時勉勵我們：「靑年應該吃苦呀』！「吃苦是磨鍊呀」］「你們要多積點經騐呀」！我們找不到職業，同時也需要求學，我們就祇能忍受這種生活。</p>
<p>聽說下學期校長將要把小學裏留剩下來的先生都辭退，再補幾個工讀生進來。</p>

<h3>How to Implement the Outline of Cultural Propaganda Policy</h3>
<p>Modern world wars are not just wars of military force, but also wars of culture. This means not only competing in strength but also in intelligence. It's not just about making the enemy fear our power, but also making them admire our virtue. This kind of new strategy is not uncommon in Chinese history. The military strategist Sun Wu had the art of "attacking the heart," and the Confucianists Confucius and Mencius had the idea of "subduing people with virtue." Furthermore, after several failures in his revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen repeatedly advocated the strategy of "propaganda is more important than combat," urging revolutionaries not to rely solely on military force but to focus on propaganda. (See Mr. Sun’s speech during the Kuomintang reorganization on December 1, 1923: "Success depends on party members, not solely on the military." And his speech to party members on December 30 of the same year: "The Kuomintang's method of struggle should focus on propaganda and not solely on military affairs.") Because the coercion of military force is temporary and localized, while the influence of culture is permanent and comprehensive. In particular, we Eastern nations have always respected the "Way of the King," which is completely opposite to the "hegemony" thinking of Europe and America. Today, in order to overthrow England and the United States and build a new world order, we should fully develop the characteristics of Eastern culture to assist in armed forces to complete the war objectives. Therefore, since our National Government entered the war, we have proposed the request of "Establishing the Outline of Wartime Cultural Policy". (See the editorial of this newspaper on February 15), hoping that the government will establish a comprehensive system for wartime cultural propaganda. Recently, the National Government has announced the "Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy," which is in line with our expectations and is indeed gratifying.</p>
<p>The "Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy" announced on June 10 first determined the direction of the wartime cultural propaganda policy, clearly stating: "On the one hand, promote the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and on the other hand, strive to rebuild and develop Chinese culture, as well as integrate and create East Asian culture, and further contribute to the world culture of the new order." From then on, not only will the cultural propaganda workers of government agencies have a clear direction to follow, but the general public and the media can also be actively encouraged and mutually exhorted to cooperate in many ways under a common direction in order to achieve its thorough implementation. With such a clear direction, everyone no longer needs to be hesitant. This direction should be the mobilization of all official and civilian cultural propaganda forces. As long as the ultimate goal is to move towards this banner, we must fully utilize our abilities and bravely advance.</p>
<p>The Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy stipulates seven major points, with the main points clearly stated and necessary explanations added. Concrete measures for establishing a comprehensive system of cultural propaganda have been detailed. On the negative side, we must liquidate the crimes of Anglo-American aggression, eliminate the poisonous thoughts of Anglo-American individual liberalism, and eliminate the despicable psychology of relying on England and the United States. At the same time, we must prevent the disruption of international communism, eliminate the poisonous thoughts of class struggle, and promote China's inherent national ethical concepts. It specifically addresses the current special phenomena and clearly reveals the elimination of hedonistic, decadent, indulgent, and trivial habits. It also points out and corrects the erroneous ideas of blindly restoring the past and blindly worshiping foreign and rejecting foreign cultures. All these negative struggle goals actually require not only cultural propaganda to be promoted vigorously, but also the general public to be vigilant in their actual thoughts, speech, and behavior. However, we must never show fear of these objects that must be eliminated. Especially those engaged in cultural propaganda work must improve their self-confidence and carefully observe, analyze, and study with the solemn and heroic attitude of medical scientists and chemists in order to thoroughly eliminate them. Just like dealing with germs, we can only eliminate them after recognizing and studying them. If we only know to be afraid and avoid them, the result will be very dangerous.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy stipulates that we must: (1) Recognize the completion of the Greater East Asia War as a prerequisite for the realization of all East Asian ideals; national collectivism as the standard for the construction of a new East Asian order; and Chinese culture as a part of East Asian culture. We should grasp the essence of Sino-Japanese culture, promote East Asian culture, consolidate the East Asian axis, and complete the mission of the war. (2) Cultivate a diligent, positive, upward, and self-disciplined outlook on life, and cooperate with a sense of practical responsibility to complete the wartime system and enhance the overall strength of the country's combat. (3) Integrate the common will of the nation, develop the creative abilities of the whole, and revive the inherent culture to strengthen the foundation of Chinese culture. (4) Popularize science education, assist scientific research, improve science and technology, and reward scientific inventions. (5) Concentrate cultural talents, unite cultural forces, adjust cultural undertakings, and establish a comprehensive system of cultural propaganda. All these points are briefly explained in the basic outline announced by the government, which coincides with what this newspaper has advocated and suggested recently (see the Selected Editorials of Shen Bao, Volume 1). We have always believed that negative sanctions are not as good as positive leadership. This is true in politics, and it is crucial in culture. Now, the main focus of the government's cultural propaganda outline is on the point of positive leadership. The stipulation of the above points can be said to be the most reliable measure to meet the public's expectations. What we demand today is rapid and sincere practice. This not only depends on the efforts of the relevant authorities, but also on the enthusiastic participation of people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>The most important point in implementing the Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy is that the government authorities should focus on positive leadership rather than negative sanctions. It is about enriching and strengthening the cultural propaganda institutions themselves, and about ensuring that cultural figures can work with peace of mind and unite in politics and economics. Especially the last point has a decisive effect on the entire policy. We sincerely hope that the government will pay special attention to this. Only when the real talents are concentrated and the real cultural forces are united, not just formally and numerically, but also substantially, can the greatest force to ensure the implementation of the policy. In the cultural sector, we hope that after the publication of this basic outline, the shadows of the past will be swept away. Everyone should strengthen their work and cultural unity with their own abilities and sincerity. In particular, the protection of the lives of cultural figures, the division of labor and cooperation in cultural undertakings, the revival of Chinese culture, and the integration and creation of Chinese and Japanese cultures depend first on the self-awareness of cultural figures themselves and the pioneering leadership of advanced elements. We really have an unspeakable feeling of anticipation.</p>
<p>In yesterday's Weekly Commentary, there was an article by Mr. Toshisuke Yoshida entitled "Words of a True Japan Expert and a China Expert." Some of the translations were not perfect, so they are supplemented and corrected as follows, hoping that readers will compare and refer to them.</p>
<p>(1) The first sentence of the first paragraph should be translated as: "Koo Hung Ming, a world-renowned civilization critic produced by modern China."</p>
<p>(2) Lines 1-3 of the fifth paragraph, "The Japanese patriotic spirit... did not understand the true meaning of Japan," should be changed to: "The Japanese-style patriotic spirit is gradually leading China to the light. The reason why they became revolutionaries is not so much that their actions in certain situations in Japan would provoke anti-Japanese movements, but rather that they had a praiseworthy sense of awakening..." The third line of the same paragraph, "did not have any revolutionary meaning," should be translated as "did not have the meaning of inciting revolution."</p>
<p>(3) The last paragraph is a quotation from Mr. Koo Hung Ming, so quotation marks should be added before and after. The first sentence is best translated as "Today's Japanese are actually true Chinese who have absorbed the essence of the Tang Dynasty." The last three sentences should be translated as: "Although it is good for Japan to use the sharp tools of modern European civilization, it must be based on the moral heart of the East to protect this flower and land."</p>

<h3>Pang Bingxun Delivers Speech to Reporters Clarifying His Aspirations for Participating in the Peace Movement Will Go to Nanjing to Meet Chairman Wang and Present His Thoughts</h3>
<p>Jinan, 13th (Central News Agency) After arriving in Jinan, General Pang Bingxun met with Chinese and Japanese reporters at the Shandong Hotel here at 10:00 a.m. today, clarifying his aspirations for participating in the peace movement, saying: "What I am currently worried about is how to carry out the suppression of the Communists. I have always held a consistent idea that the Communist Party is absolutely not allowed in China. The loyal soldiers of my 40th Army, 27th Army, and Newly Compiled 5th Army have continuously fought against the Communist army for three years. And I also strongly advocated the suppression of the Communists at the several generals' conferences I convened in Chongqing. It can be seen that my lifelong commitment to suppressing the Communists is unwavering. The work of suppressing the Communists is an essential path for peace and national construction. Furthermore, since Japan implemented a new policy towards our country, I was deeply moved at the time. In addition, countries restored the abolition of extraterritorial rights and returned concessions. Therefore, the anti-Japanese forces in Chongqing were instantly destroyed. Therefore, for the purpose of truly saving the country, I led my troops to participate in the peace movement. I will strengthen my belief in the future, and I am willing to cooperate with friendly forces to eliminate the Communist bandits in order to remove obstacles in East Asia. I also intend to absorb as much as possible the remaining forces of Chongqing in North China. Furthermore, I will go to Nanjing soon to present my thoughts to Chairman Wang."</p>
<p>Yan Xiwu's Speech in Nanjing</p>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) Yan Xiwu, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group and Commander of the 24th Division, arrived in Nanjing yesterday. When reporters heard the news, they went to visit him and were honored to hear his speech as follows: "I do not often come to Nanjing because the defense of the cities in northern Jiangsu is important, and I cannot leave my post without permission. This trip to Nanjing is specifically to meet with the Chairman to ask for instructions and report on the situation of our army's suppression of bandits and the recent defense situation. I have long advocated the Chairman's great policy of peace and national construction. I followed Commander-in-Chief Li to participate in the peace movement. Over the past two years, I have witnessed all the bright facts, which have made me more convinced. Therefore, the more I participate in hard work, the more interested I become. As for the current situation in northern Jiangsu, taking the defense zone of our army group as an example, the bandits have disappeared, the local area is gradually becoming peaceful, and the people can live and work in peace. This is because Commander-in-Chief Li has always taken the protection of the local area as his responsibility, and the troops under his command can obey orders and work hard. Indeed, without eliminating the bandits, there is no way to stabilize the local area. Without local stability, there is no way to implement good policies. It is even more necessary to promote the policy of peace and national construction as the task of our army, that is, to follow the intentions of Chairman Wang and Commander-in-Chief Li, and start from stabilizing the local area and loving the people to make the military and the people united. Then we can increase the work of peace and construction, and work hard to share the responsibility of the Greater East Asia War, to achieve the great plan of the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism, and to coexist and co-prosper with friendly nations."</p>

<h3>The Chinese Communists are Increasingly in a Difficult Situation Mao Zedong to Go to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) According to reliable sources, after the Soviet Union announced the dissolution of the Third International, the Chinese Communist Party has become an orphan without a parent. Although it has not yet exposed obvious difficulties, it can be predicted that its future destiny will inevitably fall into a difficult situation without a doubt. Recently, Chongqing has exerted great pressure in various military and political aspects, which is clear evidence. The top leaders of the Chinese Communist Party are currently extremely anxious, so they have decided to send Mao Zedong to the Soviet Union at the end of this month to appeal to the Soviet Union about the current situation and future trends of the Chinese Communist Party in order to win the sympathy of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Zhang Chongshan, Leader of the Chongqing Youth League, Participates in the Peace Movement</h3>
<p>Kaifeng, 13th (Central News Agency) Zhang Chongshan, who was formerly a leader of the Anti-Japanese Youth League in Chongqing, deeply feels that since the National Government entered the war and Japan adopted a new policy towards China, the value of the War of Resistance has been completely lost. Therefore, he recently secretly broke away from Chongqing and came to Kaifeng. According to Zhang, he was studying at Waseda University in Japan when the incident broke out. After returning to China, he went to Chongqing via Xi'an and Luoyang and was active in political circles, being a sharp figure in the Chongqing Anti-Japanese camp. After arriving in Kaifeng, he revealed the recent real situation of Chongqing as follows: Because of fear of Japanese aircraft bombing, all administrative organs in Chongqing have been moved to the suburbs to work, which takes about two hours by car to reach. Whenever Japanese aircraft raid, Chongqing is completely paralyzed. In the air raid two years ago, 20,000 refugees were suffocated to death in air-raid shelters. The reason is that Japanese aircraft came several times, and hundreds of thousands of refugees in Chongqing's air-raid shelters could not go out for a moment. They were tightly sealed in the shelters and gradually suffocated. The refugees tried to open the door to go out, but were stopped by soldiers. The crowd then rushed to the exit, but because the door panels were blocked by the crowd, they could not be opened. As a result, the crowd suffocated one by one, and the number of dead reached 11,000. The scene was extremely tragic. Therefore, this is not the fault of the bombing, but must be blamed on the Chongqing army. Although the Chongqing authorities made various propaganda afterwards, it was too far from the truth, and the people gradually did not believe it. The Chongqing authorities, seeing that their prestige had fallen, in order to alleviate the instability among civil servants and to give them hope for the future, propagated the "relocation plan," ordering all agencies to start preparing for work from next year. The so-called relocation refers to the return to Nanjing, so none of the civil servants believed it. Later, Prime Minister Tojo of Japan successively visited China, Manchuria, and the Philippine Islands. When Chongqing heard about it, it was greatly shocked. At the same time, people in Chongqing no longer trusted the United Kingdom and the United States. When the government of that day declared that it would return the exclusive concessions in China to the National Government, the Ta Kung Pao criticized the United Kingdom and the United States, making them feel embarrassed. Also, the exaggerated propaganda made by the British last time to recapture Burma, etc., was not believed by anyone in Chongqing. As for the United States, because it constantly provided a large amount of military supplies to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, but the aid to Chongqing was almost extinct, so it expressed great dissatisfaction. After the news that General Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying led 70,000 troops to participate in the peace movement was published by the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao and other newspapers, the residents of various places in North China who lived in Chongqing became more eager to return to their hometowns. When I arrived in Luoyang, I heard General Pang Bingxun broadcast a declaration of peace, which had a profound impact on the various dignitaries in Chongqing. The general public's desire to escape to peaceful areas is becoming increasingly strong.</p>

<h3>Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi Newspaper's View: British and American Policies Towards Foreign Races</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – A Yomiuri Hochi editorial in Tokyo on the 12th, titled "British and American Policies Towards Foreign Races," pointed out that the recent delay in repealing the Chinese Exclusion Act in the United States was due to the racial discrimination inherent in the Anglo-American worldview. It forcefully argued that, to correct this erroneous view and pave the way for the peaceful development of East Asian nations, the power of the Anglo-Saxon race must be eradicated. This is indeed insightful and thought-provoking. Excerpts of the main points are as follows: At this time of increasing progress in the Greater East Asia War, what causes us the most indignation is the extremely hateful and contemptuous attitude that Britain and the United States, based on their mistaken notions of racial discrimination, continue to display towards people of color. For example, the South African Federal Parliament recently passed a law prohibiting Indians from purchasing land in the provinces of Natal and Transvaal. During the period of widespread coal mine strikes in the United States, the Packard Motor Company in Detroit, as recently as the beginning of this month, experienced a strike based on the reason of excluding black laborers. Even the U.S. House of Representatives, in an effort to appease Chongqing, had considered amending the Chinese Exclusion Act, but this has now been shelved. As a result, the truth of America's contempt for China has been exposed, placing it in an embarrassing situation. The United States, under the guise of being an ally, deceived Chongqing and Chiang, attempting to exploit them as the front line against Japan. Chongqing was taken advantage of, willingly accepting American command as an allied nation. But let us look back at the history of Chinese immigrants to the United States. It began in 1850 with their recruitment to mine gold in California. However, within ten years, anti-Chinese sentiment arose in America. Subsequently, treaties were signed in 1868 and 1880. By 1882, the United States completely closed its doors based on the Chinese Exclusion Act. Before the movement to exclude Asians became serious due to the expulsion of students in 1906, which also impacted Japanese immigration, the focus was solely on overseas Chinese. Because excluding the Japanese could create significant problems in the Pacific, while the Chinese government was powerless to intervene at the time, the atrocities against the Chinese continued unabated. Overseas Chinese were even used as test subjects for new forms of capital punishment, and "Chinatown" in San Francisco was treated by Americans as a display of exotic curiosities. The "anti-miscegenation laws" implemented in the southern states of the United States were imitated by enacting laws prohibiting Americans from marrying Mongolians, equating Asians with blacks. Furthermore, in 1917 and 1924, immigration laws were enacted to completely exclude Chinese and Japanese from the American continent. Today, the United States, witnessing Japan's friendly measures towards China, such as the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of exclusive concessions, fears that its hypocritical mask of "justice and humanity" will be torn off. Therefore, under the direction of the authorities, the House of Representatives proposed amending the Chinese Exclusion Act. However, since the review of the bill began, there has been much opposition. The House Immigration Committee, fearing its rejection would affect America's policy towards China, announced a postponement of the vote. By this point, even those who once deeply believed in America's friendship with China must now see that America views China as a slave. As for the issue of discrimination against Indians in South Africa, it began as early as 1860 when Indian laborers were recruited to work in the province of Natal. The Anglo-American people inherently possess a sense of superiority and discriminate against people of color. This, coupled with conflicting economic interests with the Indians, spurred the rise of the anti-British movement in India, leading to significant historical problems. Britain and the United States dare to act against the tide during this time of war, causing such major events. This shows that their erroneous notions of racial discrimination are deeply ingrained and beyond redemption. The American people, in order to maintain their own survival, have exhausted their capacity for aggression and oppression against other nations. The British conquest of India, the Opium Wars, the American invasion of Hawaii, the occupation of the Philippines, and the private torture of black slaves are all confirmations of this. The British and Americans are so tyrannical and ruthless that the result will be nothing more than digging their own graves. Therefore, we must continue to engage in fierce battles with them to annihilate them. Unless we overthrow Britain and the United States, there is no path to survival for the East Asian nations. This is something that the entire East Asian people must keep in mind.</p>
<h3>German Scientists Invent New Thermometer</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – Dentsu News Agency reports that German scientists Klenze and Reinhart have invented a new type of thermometer. This thermometer uses a colorless liquid to replace the colored fluid normally used, as the colored fluid rises and falls erratically at excessively high or low temperatures. This colorless liquid, after a special process, can accurately measure temperature fluctuations from 200 degrees Celsius below zero to 400 degrees Celsius above zero. In contrast, mercury freezes at -36 degrees Celsius.</p>
<h3>Philippine Inspection Group Arrives in Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Philippine inspection group to Japan, led by Manila Mayor Kinde, and a group of 19 people arrived in Japan at 10:00 AM on the 13th, and are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on the 14th. Furthermore, Mr. Di Lang, Director-General of the New Philippine Service Group, and Mr. Tomoto Hisayoshi, head of the Japan-Philippine Association, were very pleased to have the opportunity to meet again. According to reports, Mr. Okamoto and Mr. Di Lang met 11 years ago when Mr. Okamoto was a vice-consul at the Japanese consulate in Manila. At that time, Britain and the United States wanted to oppress the Filipino people as puppets, so Mr. Di Lang, as a lawyer, fought against Britain and the United States to prevent this from happening. He advocated for Philippine independence to awaken the Filipino people and ignite their passion for national liberation, and was repeatedly suppressed by American officials. He was rescued from danger several times by Vice-Consul Okamoto. After the establishment of the new Philippine government, he took on the important position of Director-General of the Service Group. He came to Japan as one of the members of the first Philippine Inspection Group to Japan and was overjoyed to meet Mr. Okamoto again.</p>

<h3>The Battle of the Sea of Japan and the Battle of Jutland (1)</h3>
<p>– Ito Masanori</p>
<p>The two major naval battles of the 20th century occurred on May 27th and May 31st. However, people generally doubt whether they will ever see such large-scale naval battles again, and it is questionable whether it will actually happen. But I believe there is still hope of seeing them. In this situation, reviewing the historical significance of this Battle of Jutland, I believe, is even more important.</p>
<p>(1) Tactical Thinking and Tactics</p>
<p>During the Russo-Japanese War, Japanese Admiral Togo decisively initiated a bold decisive battle in front of the enemy at a distance of 8,000 meters. However, during the Battle of Jutland, British Admiral Jellicoe cautiously initiated a cautious evasive maneuver from a distance of 24,000 meters. Comparing the two is very meaningful. The former bravely advanced on the path of annihilation, while the latter was an action that only attempted artillery fire. Obviously, there is a huge disparity in strategic planning between the two, and there is also a very different tactical ideology. The difference between the Battle of the Sea of ​​Japan and the Battle of Jutland can be specifically said to be caused by the fundamental differences in the concepts of naval warfare between the commanders-in-chief of Japan and Britain. The difference lies in tactical thinking, which is completed by the commander-in-chief. I completed the annihilation tactics, while they missed the opportunity.</p>
<p>So, what was the artillery battle like after it unfolded? Admiral Togo waited for an opportunity while being bombarded by the enemy, without reaching a parallel combat position or an effective artillery range. At 2:10 PM, the entire Japanese fleet (12 ships) began bombarding simultaneously at a distance of 6,000 meters from the enemy. The shooting was truly amazing. At 2:20 PM, the battleship Oslyabya, at the front left of the enemy, was enveloped in flames. At 2:50 PM, the bow sank and fell out of the battle line (sank at 3:20 PM). At 3:00 PM, the flagship Suvorov was also surrounded by flames and abandoned from the battle line. Commander Rozhestvensky was seriously injured, and command of the main fleet was transferred to the second ship, Alexander III (overall command transferred to Rear Admiral Nebogatov). The second ship was also dropped out of the battle line at 3:08 PM. The third ship, Borodino, first attempted to escape and was temporarily able to escape at 3:25 PM due to the misty rain.</p>
<p>During this first attack of approximately one hour, the Togo fleet fired a total of 150 shells with a caliber of 8 inches or more, of which 50 were fired within the first ten minutes. This really broke the world record for naval battles. In contrast, what was the Battle of Jutland like? At 6:30 PM, the British main force began bombarding the enemy at a distance of 12,000 meters, but there were no firing orders or instructions for distributing artillery fire. Instead, the 24 ships arbitrarily decided on targets and began bombarding. German Admiral Scheer used his specialty, the turning maneuver, to repel the British ships in one go. This first artillery battle was only ten minutes long. But these ten minutes were very important. At this critical juncture, the British army became a mess because of Jellicoe's order to reduce speed by 14 nautical miles. Only 12 ships were able to fire, which was only half of the entire fleet. Among them, Duke of Iron fired six shots, Sandela four shots, and Eland and Ending Cow one shot each, totaling twelve shots. In fact, two shots hit the German Kenighark, two shots hit Maguraff, three shots hit Louzauni, and one shot hit Defflinger, for a total of eight hits.</p>
<p>(2) Japanese Bombardment and British Bombardment</p>
<p>Originally, the number of hits often shifted depending on the weather conditions. The sea conditions at the time of the Battle of Jutland were very foggy and hindered aiming, but the waves were very slight. The conditions during the Battle of the Sea of Japan were the opposite. The six-inch guns on the hull were almost completely washed away by the waves, and the waves were so fierce and the rocking of the ship was relatively large. The ratio of artillery destructive power to armor defense power was almost equal in 1905 and 1916. However, the Japanese fleet had already achieved the effect of artillery fire during the first attack, which determined the future of the battle. On the contrary, the British fleet only destroyed the six-inch-caliber gun of the German ship Derfflinger, and damaged the starboard side of the Keton Shark, causing it to tilt and immerse 4.5 degrees in the water, and then broke the wireless electrical components of the Maguraff. This pales in comparison to the firepower of the Togo fleet.</p>
<p>Later, due to successive artillery battles, the British army inflicted considerable damage on the German army. This was because 33 main battleships fired at the same time, and even stray bullets that were not blocked would have a considerable effect. However, the British ships were hit by 21 German fleets as severely as described above. In this respect, the Togo fleet in the Sea of Japan was much more superior.</p>
<p>During the second engagement from 7:04 PM to 7:20 PM, the number of shells fired by the British main battleships still recorded in history was 128, of which only 29 were hit (15 ships were not recorded, if these ships were added, the total number of shells fired was probably around 250). Due to such artillery fire from the British, the German ship Louzauni fell out of the battle line, and the four ships on Hipper's line lost most of their combat power. At that time, the British suffered very little loss, and everyone believed that the artillery battle was advantageous to the British. However, comparing this with the Battle of the Sea of Japan, a world of difference can be found.</p>
<p>The second attack in the Sea of Japan started at 4:00 PM. The enemy escaped by taking advantage of the mist. At 6:00 PM, the third search was conducted, and they were immediately attacked fiercely. In this battle, the new German battleship Alexander III was fatally struck, and the same type of Borodino was sunk. In other words, in the artillery battle on the first day, the enemy lost four of the five new main battleships. Compared with the results achieved by Nelson in the Battle of Trafalgar, the results of Jellicoe in the Battle of Jutland were completely different.</p>
<p>(3) Significant Differences in Tactical Movements</p>
<p>It is very interesting to compare Jellicoe's fleet movement with that of Togo's fleet. Admiral Togo repeatedly performed right-angle battles, two right-angle battles, or all-at-once turn-around battles no less than ten times. Whenever the enemy attempted to retreat and escape, our fleet would chase forward to make contact, and would often put pressure on the enemy's leading ships from North Li Dong, or from the North and West. In short, he tried to block their escape route to Vladivostok. Jellicoe did the opposite, easily allowing the German ships to escape to the west, and was very slow to maneuver for another battle. This is also a difference between the Battle of the Sea of ​​Japan and the Battle of Jutland.</p>
<p>In addition, a more interesting comparison is that German Commander-in-Chief Scheer implemented the all-at-once turning maneuver of the fleet three times (when retreating at 6:38 PM, when attacking at 6:55 PM, and when retreating at 7:17 PM) and cleverly escaped the bombardment of the British army. However, our Admiral Togo also implemented the same all-at-once turning maneuver three times (2:56 PM, 3:48 PM, 4:35 PM), cleverly capturing the Russian warships. The "all-at-once turning maneuver" in Japanese is "Gefechtskehrtwendung" in German naval language, and is the most outstanding of fleet movements. It is the most important and most difficult movement, but the British Navy has not practiced it in the main fleet in recent years, so there is no suitable term. The British sometimes say "Swingaround maneuver" and sometimes call it "Simultaneous wheeling away". But Jellicoe himself said in his book: "This kind of movement, in the case of a large fleet, only causes confusion and danger, so this tactic should be avoided." Therefore, he never thought that on May 31, 1916, his enemy had actually implemented it against him three times. Because he believed that this movement was not suitable for large fleets, he assumed that the enemy would not use this tactic either."</p>
<p>In Jellicoe's naval battle report, it was recorded that every time the German army turned around and retreated, "the enemy disappeared because of the mist and smoke," but no mention was made of the turning movement. Jellicoe knew this only after reading Scheer's History of the Battle of Jutland in 1923. His assistant, Admiral Beatty, did not know this either. To prove this, you can look at Beatty's report, which was published in the British Admiralty's naval battle report on the Battle of Jutland in 1920. Attached to it was a battle track chart, which completely omitted the German army's reversal tactics at 6:55 PM and 7:17 PM. This certainly proves that Beatty did not know that the German army had implemented reversal tactics at that time. The chart, which detailed the movements of the two armies, did not record this, which can only prove that they did not know. Beatty knew about it seven years after the Battle of Jutland, in 1923! There is reason why the British army failed in the decisive battle and was criticized!</p>
<p>Looking back at this turning movement, Admiral Togo performed it three times in the great naval battle that took place in the Strait of Japan eleven years before the Battle of Jutland (one of which was a continuous two times, so it can also be called four times), using this to block the enemy from escaping. This is one of the major reasons for completing the earth-shattering annihilation battle. Jellicoe may have said that he did not encounter a similar shaped movement in the Battle of Jutland. The greatness of the Battle of the Sea of Japan, even from the point of view of this movement, is unprecedented. (Tao: Translated from the June issue of Chuo Koron)</p>
<h3>The Axis Powers Have Long Been Fully Prepared to Defend the European Continent: An Impenetrable Mediterranean Wall Has Been Built from Italy to the Southern Coast of France</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Mediterranean war situation has entered a new phase due to the Anti-Axis forces occupying Pantelleria Island, causing extreme tension in the mainland and Southern Europe. A German military correspondent recently inspected the Mediterranean coast in Southern France and has now returned to Berlin. According to him, regarding the "Mediterranean Wall" situation along the southern coast of France from Italy to Spain, the German Supreme Command has taken comprehensive measures in the southern coastal area of France to prepare for future developments, with similar measures being taken elsewhere. Following the advance of the German army, German construction teams have arrived in southern France to build the "Mediterranean Wall." This "Wall" is not only defensive in nature but has also become an important base for attacking the enemy's supply lines in the Mediterranean. The defensive capabilities of any small point along the coast are extremely strong, and the ports have become powerful fortresses. Airfields also appear to have been built in various locations. The Germans have built submarine shelters, the "Atlantic Wall," and western fortresses over the past five years and have considerable experience. Therefore, this "Mediterranean Wall" was built using past experience. Moreover, due to the suitable climate along the Mediterranean coast and the abundance of bays and mountainous areas, construction progressed easily. Currently, the Axis forces have sharp troops stationed behind this "Wall" to prevent enemy attacks, adopting a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Huitong News Agency reports: The Anti-Axis side, especially the British newspapers, are currently discussing the issue of invading Europe. The Berlin military only commented on this yesterday, saying, "We are prepared." The Anti-Axis and neutral countries appear to be greatly concerned about the invasion, but there is no such feeling in the military circles of Central Europe. Experts believe that this indifferent attitude is due to the German military having taken various military measures not only during the past few quiet months but also having established special defense facilities long ago. Regarding the Strait area and the Atlantic coast, defensive arrangements were immediately initiated after occupation, and the southern coast of France was also closed off in November 1942. Military officials assured that "all vulnerable points in Europe are now armored and continuously strengthened." It is also learned here that although occasional detailed articles on these defense facilities are published, the enemy cannot discern the overall strength of this defense. There is no specific expression of the German plan itself, and the German side has no doubts or hasty reactions. The military here clearly believes in the strength of Germany and its Axis allies and therefore has no doubt that they will achieve victory in future military developments.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to a Tongmeng News Agency reporter here, the main war in Europe has now progressed from land warfare to a period of decisive battles in the air. Regarding the Eastern Front, the German and Soviet air forces are currently engaged in a fierce battle for air supremacy. On the Western Front, the German and British air forces are also exerting their power to the fullest, as is the case in the Mediterranean. Military observers stated that the current air war has reached its peak, and the decisive battle of total mobilization of land, sea, and air forces on both sides is clearly approaching. The Anti-Axis camp is currently making every effort to promote the imminent landing attacks on several key points in Europe. The reporter then listed several reasons why the Anti-Axis forces cannot land in Europe. Since the completion of the Atlantic defense in May of this year, there is no gap to exploit along the coastline from the northern tip of Norway to the Bay of Biscay in the south. In particular, the southern coast of France has almost become a practical artillery position. The Anti-Axis countries must use enormous manpower and resources to invade Europe, not to mention the loss of their ships. Military observers also discussed that when the Anti-Axis forces want to launch an offensive on the European continent, the Soviet Union must simultaneously launch a large-scale offensive on the Eastern Front, but in reality, the Soviet Union does not have this combat capability. The reporter also said that the Axis forces have completed all preparations to resist the enemy's reckless actions. The German Supreme Command is currently considering that there is no need to launch a summer offensive on the Eastern Front this year, and it only needs to deplete the Soviet military's combat power in order to win the future decisive battle with the Anti-Axis forces. With this strategy, Germany is working to coordinate the occupied areas.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Since the sudden tension in the Mediterranean war, the Anti-Axis forces have repeatedly declared that they will invade Europe. The German People's Observer newspaper specifically published an article on the 12th entitled "Confident in National Strength and Complete Preparation" to explain Germany's confidence in defending the European continent. The general idea is that it would be a mistake for us to ignore the current difficulties, because to achieve the final victory, we must overcome these difficulties. The enemy has been eager to discourage our morale, but they have now clearly failed. Threats of indiscriminate bombing and the destruction of the German nation have instead proved that the enemy is aware of the difficulties of its situation and cannot cope with the war. Looking at the map, it can be seen that today's war situation is not comparable to that of 1918, because in 1918, six major powers attacked Germany and its allies, but today the two sides are evenly matched. It is expected that the European continent after the war will begin reconstruction work, the scale of which will be unprecedented in world history. We certainly know that there are still many difficulties ahead, but we are confident that if we use past experience to overcome the various current difficulties, our goals will certainly be achieved in the near future.</p>
<h3>The Mediterranean War Situation Has Now Entered a New Stage</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to Huitong News Agency citing news from London, British officials announced last night that the Italian garrison on Lampedusa Island south of Pantelleria has surrendered to the Anti-Axis forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Huitong News Agency reports that Lieutenant Wei Bai recently communicated from Catania, Sicily, saying that Pantelleria Island has an area of only eighty-three square miles. It is unprecedented in military history that such a small island could withstand such intense bombing. The island's heroic defenders, including some German squads, bravely resisted the enemy's sea and air offensives for five weeks, and were forced to cease resistance on June 11 only due to a lack of drinking water.</p>
<p>Rome, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Huitong News Agency reporters here announced last night that Pantelleria Island has fallen. Rome now expects that the Anti-Axis forces will invade Sicily and Sardinia in the near future. The public is discussing all the actions of the Anti-Axis forces that have already been obtained from this perspective. At the same time, Lampedusa Island is still being bravely defended by its small number of defenders. Pantelleria could have resisted for longer if it had not been for the lack of water. Such difficulties are unlikely to occur on larger Italian islands, and plans to defend Sicily and Sardinia have been specified in great detail.</p>
<p>The Battle of Pantelleria Island</p>
<p>Rome, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to Huitong News Agency, it was stated here last night that the resistance on Pantelleria lasted from May 9th to June 11th. During these thirty-three days, the garrison on the island displayed extraordinary bravery. The Italian Air Force and anti-aircraft guns shot down 162 British and American aircraft, eliminating 800 Anti-Axis air force personnel. In addition, 16 Anti-Axis aircraft were shot down by German fighter planes, 8 of which were shot down in a single day on Thursday. The island is 14 kilometers long and 8 kilometers wide, with a total area of 830,000 square kilometers. The terrain is mostly flat, with only a few high points near the coast that can be used for defense, making the defense of the island quite difficult. In the rocks of the highlands, there are caves that can shield aircraft, and the aircraft can take off from these caves to the adjacent airfields. The island has this convenience, so a part of the air force used the place as a base, but it is not easy to develop this base. The island's air defense largely relies on Sicily, which is only 100 kilometers away. Italian military circles emphasized that even if the Anti-Axis forces attempt to land on Sicily, Pantelleria Island is not very important, because Malta is a strong naval and air base, and its distance from Sicily is similar to that of Pantelleria. Moreover, the Anti-Axis forces now occupy Tunisia, so Pantelleria Island is only a weak link between the African coast and Malta. It is believed that after being damaged by British and American air raids, the possibility of greatly improving it as a base is unlikely. Pantelleria's previous importance was because it could be used by the Axis side as a base for the air force and a small part of the fleet to compete for transportation traffic in the Strait of Sicily and maintain the supply of German and Italian troops in North Africa. Regarding the fate of Lampedusa Island south of Pantelleria, Rome also has no illusions. The general view here is that the island is absolutely isolated and has only a small number of defenders, so it will sooner or later succumb to the Anti-Axis forces. Italian newspapers commented yesterday on the loss of Pantelleria Island, saying, "Pantelleria Island is a typical model of the Italian military's resistance and fighting spirit. If the enemy attempts to advance north from Pantelleria Island, they will encounter major difficulties. Pantelleria Island has done its best in terms of human capabilities to resist the enemy's advance. The Italian military's resistance will only stop when the last possible hope has been exhausted." The Tribune stated that the island's resistance lasted for six weeks, not just thirteen days as claimed by London Radio. The newspaper said, "The Pantelleria Island incident cannot prevent us from continuing to fight a magnificent and resolute battle. We will fight bravely wherever the enemy appears."</p>
<p>Several British and American Ships Were Sunk</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: The German military authorities stated on the 12th that the German Air Force had achieved great results in the sea area of Pantelleria Island, meaning that the German Air Force's powerful new bomber squadrons bombed Anti-Axis ships in the Strait of Sicily and the sea area of Pantelleria Island day and night on the 11th, achieving great results, sinking one 8,000-ton transport ship and 13 landing ships, and severely damaging 5 large cargo ships, totaling 25,000 to 30,000 tons. In addition, three enemy cruisers and eight other warships were damaged, including one heavy cruiser that sank after being bombed, and one heavy cruiser and one light cruiser were severely damaged and lost their combat effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Speculation on the Candidates for Commander-in-Chief of the British and American Invasion of Europe</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to Huitong News Agency, the diplomatic correspondent of the London Observer claimed that General Marshall has a high chance of being appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the British and American Allied Forces for the Invasion of Europe, and General Wavell may be the Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces for the Invasion of Europe. If the position of Commander-in-Chief is held by an American general, then the Chief of Staff must be a British general to be satisfactory.</p>
<h3>British Land and Air Forces Inspect the North African Battlefield</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to news from the Anti-Axis headquarters in North Africa, British Secretary of State for War Sir Grigg and Secretary of State for Air Sinclair arrived in North Africa yesterday. According to a Reuters reporter stationed there, officials did not indicate any specific purpose for their trip, but they are generally expected to participate in discussions at military headquarters and may inspect the Tunisian battlefield. Among those welcoming them at the airport were Air Marshal Tedder and Minister to North Africa Macmillan.</p>
<h3>Fierce Bayonet Fight on the Orel Front: Soviet Offensive Finally Collapses</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to combined news received here, the Soviet army on the Eastern Front, due to successive defeats, was eager to reverse the declining trend. On the morning of the 11th of this month, it launched simultaneous offensives at various points on the central and southern fronts. Under the cover of strong air force, it attempted to break through the German defenses. However, it was met with fierce counterattacks by the German army everywhere, resulting in the collapse of the Soviet offensive plan. According to reports, the Soviet army southwest of Moscow first launched attacks on the 11th at dawn in Dorogobuzh and Orel. The attack in Orel was particularly fierce. After a fierce attack on the German positions with air force and artillery, it attempted to seize the German front-line fortress with strong infantry units. However, the German army immediately launched a fierce counterattack, and after an extremely fierce bayonet fight, it repelled the Soviet army. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses in this battle. At the same time, the Soviet army also launched a fierce attack on the 12th along the Mius River west of Rostov, but was also defeated by the German army's fierce counterattack. In addition, the German vanguard unit in the Azov coastal area of the Kuban bridgehead advanced north, eliminating Soviet resistance, and has advanced to a considerable area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Huitong News Agency military visitor General Steiffreit declared that after the Soviet army's fourth major offensive against the German positions in the Kuban bridgehead failed, the war activities in the area have suddenly decreased in the past week. In this fourth offensive, the Soviet army lost a total of 13 infantry divisions, 3 brigades, 6 tank battalions, and countless aircraft in a small area northwest of Krymskaya. Although the Soviet army suffered such heavy losses, what it gained was extremely limited. The Soviet army once broke into the German front line for three kilometers, but was soon driven back by the German counterattack, and 100 tanks and 350 aircraft were destroyed. It is expected that since Stalin is determined to seize Novorossiysk Port and the Taman Peninsula to control the Kerch Strait, he will continue to attack in the Kuban area. Fortunately, the German soldiers are dutiful, and with the assistance of the air force, all the Soviet army's attempts to seize the above bases through landing strategies have not been successful.</p>
<h3>Italians Turn a Deaf Ear to Roosevelt's Appeal</h3>
<p>Rome, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: President Roosevelt has appealed to the Italians to make a certain promise to the Allies and to ask the Italians to drive the Germans out of Italy. Roman political circles told Huitong News Agency yesterday, "We will regard Roosevelt's words as non-existent." Therefore, officials or the press will not comment on Roosevelt's words, but a qualified official told Huitong News Agency that Roosevelt made this appeal when the Anti-Axis countries had admitted that they could not make the Italians submit by other means, especially aerial terrorist attacks, which is indeed noteworthy. Making an appeal at this time shows that the Anti-Axis has no other way to approach the European fortress. If we consider the example of the Near East countries and how the Anti-Axis countries treated their former ally France, it is not difficult to imagine what position Italy will occupy in the international order created by Roosevelt. In any case, Roosevelt did not mention that if Italy follows his appeal, will all the American colonies be returned to Italy? Roosevelt cannot make this promise, because we already know the United States' intentions towards North Africa, and we also know how the United States will deal with Eritrea, our oldest colony. Because Roosevelt once promised the American people that he would not send American troops outside of the Americas, everyone can see that Roosevelt is determined not to keep his promises.</p>
<h3>Spanish Nationalist Party Establishes Headquarters in Rome</h3>
<p>Rome, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Stefani News Agency reports: The newly established headquarters of the Spanish Nationalist Party in Rome opened yesterday, with the participation of the Spanish ambassador, the Deputy Secretary of the Fascist Party, and a representative of the German Socialist Party stationed in Italy. The Spanish ambassador delivered a speech strongly emphasizing the importance of this ceremony. Participants in the ceremony included members of the Spanish Nationalist Party and Italian legions that had participated in the civil war in Spain. The Spanish ambassador said that this represents a kind of unity between nations fighting for justice. Spain is invigorated by the sincerity of its leader General Franco, who will surely accomplish his goals. At the end of the ceremony, the crowd cheered for Spain and its leader, as well as for Italy and its Prime Minister.</p>
<h3>British and American Aircraft Attack Germany, Losing Sixty-One Aircraft</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to news received last night, as a result of British and American air raids on German territory day and night on June 11, a total of 61 aircraft were lost. It is believed that many damaged British and American aircraft failed to return to their bases when they flew back. It was previously reported that 54 British and American aircraft were destroyed in this battle.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Army Chief Replaced</h3>
<p>Budapest, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Hungarian Defense Minister General Nagy submitted his resignation on the 12th, and the vacancy was filled by General Chaty. The new Defense Minister Chaty has been the Commander-in-Chief of the Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front since 1942 and has achieved considerable results.</p>
<h3>On the Eve of the German-Soviet Decisive Battle: A Complete Picture of Soviet Combat Power (2)</h3>
<p>Two. In the German-Soviet War, some people believed that the Soviet Union had an overwhelming advantage in human resources over Germany. With the progress of the German-Soviet War and the loss of most of the most densely populated European Russian regions, it is necessary to make some corrections to this point. However, according to the Soviet side, it is only "some" after all. Why do I say that? According to the Soviet Union, since the beginning of the German-Soviet War, the Soviet Union has successively moved important military-industrial industries in European Russia to the east, and the labor force has naturally moved with these industries. The residents in the German-occupied areas are almost only elderly people and children without labor capacity and non-combatants. This seems to be different from the facts. According to German reports, a large number of Soviet residents actively cooperated with the German army.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the first five-year plan, the Soviet Union has been able to implement the mobilization of female labor. After the start of the German-Soviet War, the mobilization of female labor was thoroughly implemented. According to the report of the New York correspondent Snow, female labor accounts for 90% of the total labor force in the military industry.</p>
<p>This Snow's report cannot be taken as a standard, but it can be seen that in the past, female labor was only mobilized in all departments except those that were beyond their capacity, but now there are also female labor working in departments that were previously considered impossible.</p>
<p>Because the men replaced by these female laborers are successively conscripted into the army and sent to the front line, the Soviet Union's claim that, from the perspective of human resources alone, the Soviet Union's position has hardly changed.</p>
<p>The problem lies in the training level of soldiers and the proficiency level of labor. The training level of soldiers is far behind the German army. The fact that the Red Army's damage is greater than that of the German army is enough to prove it. Of course, this does not only depend on the training level of the Red Army soldiers, but also on other reasons, such as the quality of commanders, the overall quality, and so on. After a year and a half of actual combat experience, the Soviet Union seems to have improved a lot in this regard.</p>
<p>Speaking of the skill level of laborers, it declines with the prolongation of the war. This is a phenomenon that can be seen in any country, and it is not necessarily the case only in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities are desperately engaged in the training of skilled laborers, trying to fill this gap. Various societies have also launched socialist competitions between military factories, which cannot be overlooked from the perspective of increasing production.</p>
<p>The second is the issue of material resources. The proportion of the machinery industry in the Soviet Union's heavy industry sector is said to be 25%, which not only exceeds that of European countries, but also surpasses the United States. Since the beginning of the German-Soviet War, the Soviet Union first moved the machine tool industry to the Urals. As a result, according to the Soviet side, all of them in European Russia have been moved to the east.</p>
<p>Whether this is the case in reality cannot be determined because there is no clue at present, but as seen in the Winter War, the production of tanks and aircraft cannot be ignored. British and American aid to the Soviet Union is like a drop in the bucket in such a large-scale war. Even if the tanks manufactured in the United States can escape the commercial destruction war of national submarines and reach the Soviet Union, because they are not accompanied by the necessary parts, once they are damaged on the battlefield, it is difficult to repair them. Therefore, it is necessary to disassemble the American-made tanks and use their parts to repair them.</p>
<p>Therefore, the British and American materials are not as effective in the war against Germany as they claim, but rather, as Germany stated, the Red Army's mechanical units are completely self-made products of the Soviet Union. The military industry that moved to the east has been on the right track since the beginning of this year, so the Soviet Union's military production will reach its peak in the autumn of this year. Germany cannot but abandon its hopeful observation and take full and timely measures!</p>
<p>However, the production of Soviet aircraft is far behind the German army in terms of both quality and quantity. In modern warfare, where the existence or absence of air supremacy directly determines the outcome of the war, the Soviet Union can be said to be at a great disadvantage in this regard.</p>
<p>The backwardness of Soviet aircraft production is partly due to the shortage of light metals, and the biggest reason is the lack of technology. The Soviet Union is now recruiting a large number of aircraft manufacturers from Austria and related technologies, striving to develop technical backwardness, and at the same time building many new aircraft factories in the Urals and Biliya, pouring all its efforts into the production of high-quality aircraft.</p>
<p>Three. In the effort to carry out the war, the issue of transportation capacity is of great importance. In the 18th All-Union Communist Party Congress held before the German-Soviet War, Malenkov fiercely criticized the backwardness of the Soviet Union's transportation sector. At the same time, the resolution of the conference also required the rapid resolution of the backwardness of the transportation sector.</p>
<p>The 18th Party Congress, as it seems today, was convened because it saw the inevitability of the German-Soviet War. The special emphasis on the issue of transportation capacity in this conference is to illustrate that the backwardness of transportation capacity is directly a weakness of the Soviet Union's ability to resist war.</p>
<p>Originally, the backwardness of the transportation sector can be said to be a weakness in the socialist construction of the Soviet Union. Inheriting the Soviet Union, which lacked a transportation network in the era of Tsarist Russia, although it spent a lot of effort to build railways and achieved today's achievements. However, moments of chaos and delays in cargo transportation are not uncommon.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why the Soviet Union suffered heavy losses due to the rapid and decisive offensive of the German army at the beginning of the German-Soviet War was the imperfection of this transportation mechanism. Since then, the Soviet authorities have desperately engaged in increasing the capacity of the transportation sector, and any acts of nostalgia that delay the transportation of troops and military supplies are executed. Since adopting this strict policy, great improvements have been made, and the above-mentioned situation has not recurred.</p>
<p>The 18th issue of the Communist magazine published on September 17, 1942, contains an article by Itchiryushkin entitled "Soviet Railway Workers Under the Conditions of the Motherland War," which stated that the Soviet railway transportation sector completely overcame the backwardness of the war and satisfactorily fulfilled the tasks assigned to it. The records of railway workers being executed for failing to perform their duties, which were often published in Soviet newspapers, are no longer found.</p>
<p>It is said that the Red Army recovered most of the territory lost in the summer during the winter battle. At the same time, it began to lay the roads that were thoroughly destroyed by the German army. The Soviet Union is now desperately repairing the damaged railways and roads, which will undoubtedly be a major obstacle in the future summer operations. According to a report from the Swedish News Agency, the Soviet Union must completely change the German-style track width to the Soviet track width, which requires a lot of labor and time. At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that the German air force is now intensifying its concentrated bombing of Soviet railway facilities.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the morale issue, which is the most important factor in the Soviet Union's ability to resist war. As everyone knows, since the appointment of Hitler as Head of State in 1933, the propaganda work has been greatly implemented in order to cultivate the people's hatred of Nazi Germany, and it seems to have achieved a certain degree of success. After the establishment of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in August 1939, the attacks on the Nazis disappeared on the surface. However, after the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, the Soviet propaganda machine's attacks on the Nazis became as hot as fire again.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union completely blamed Germany for the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, aroused the people's patriotism, shouted to defend the motherland to deal with the German army's "invasion," and re-cultivated the people's hatred of Nazi Germany. This, coupled with the 25 years of thorough communist education of the people, has achieved great success, and is reflected in the defense battles of Leningrad, Sevastopol, and Stalingrad.</p>
<p>The fighting spirit of the younger generation is even more vigorous. Their Stalin worship has reached a feverish level. According to Soviet reports, they would not hesitate to go to death if there was Stalin's order. In the October 1942 issue of the Tzunamiye magazine. The middle-length novel "Near Moscow" by Evgeny-Gavrilovich is worth talking about. That novel depicts the battle situation of the Red Army near Moscow in the autumn of 1941. Various Red Army soldiers appear in the novel, which is enough to arouse the morale of readers. Its propaganda value can be said to be 100%.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Soviet authorities abused the issuance of the Lenin Medal and the title of "Soviet Hero" to boost the morale of the people. On the other hand, they also called the front-line soldiers "Guards" and formulated three medals, namely, Guotov, Svrov, and Navsky, to encourage the Red Army's fighting spirit.</p>
<p>In short, the morale of the Soviet people is becoming more and more vigorous with the progress of the German-Soviet War, and the Stalin regime shows no signs of rupture. Red Army military commentators, whenever they have the opportunity, frankly admit that the Red Army's operational mobility is inferior to that of the German army, and use vigorous morale to make up for this weakness, and strictly rectify military discipline. However, no matter how vigorous the Soviet morale is, it is an undeniable fact that the Soviet Union has difficulty making progress in purely military operations.

<h3>Public Concession to Conduct Random Checks on Households After Registration: Each Household Should First Fill Out a Guarantee for Verification to Ensure That the Household Registration Is Not Falsely Reported</h3>
<p>In order to strictly prevent the activities of criminals, the police and Baojia authorities of the Public Concession have begun to conduct random checks on household registrations in some areas. If it is found that there is false reporting of the population or exceeding the reported population, they will be severely punished in accordance with the Baojia Regulations. Before the random check of household registrations, the Baojia authorities will issue a guarantee to each household to fill out, guaranteeing that the household has not over-reported or under-reported the population. If there is any deliberate violation, they are willing to be punished. This guarantee must be filled out within three days and submitted to the superior Baojia for verification, so as to have a reference for the random check of household registrations. This matter has been implemented in the Xinzha District, and other districts seem to be implemented one after another.</p>
<h3>Route 20 Tram Strictly Prohibits Carrying Cigarettes and Cloth</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Police authorities stipulated in April of this year that from April 25th, it is not allowed to carry more than three liters of rice and other bulky objects in the Route 20 tram. According to the reporter of Datong News Agency, the authorities recently sent a letter to the Shanghai West Tram Transportation Section, instructing the car service personnel that from now on, single merchants carrying cigarettes, cloth and other controlled items in the Route 20 tram should also be prohibited. Those who do not comply will be ordered to get off the car.</p>
<h3>Black-Plate Tricycles Prohibited from Soliciting Passengers</h3>
<p>The source of gasoline in this city has been blocked, and various public and private vehicles have been restricted to save gasoline consumption. Therefore, tricycles have emerged in response, and transportation depends on them. However, it has been found that black-plate tricycles are soliciting passengers along the road, violating the regulations. The tricycle guild has specially submitted a request to the Municipal Public Works Bureau for investigation and prohibition to maintain its business. After receiving the letter, the bureau has consulted the Municipal Police to ban them.</p>

<h3>Unblocking the Source of Oil and Sugar to Maintain Legitimate Needs</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the legitimate needs of oil and sugar, the Shanghai Food Oil Industry, Wholesale Department and Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Department are requesting the military distribution authorities to make every effort to unblock the source, so as to provide long-term rations of oil and sugar to households and the business needs of various industries. The reporter of Shanghai News Agency learned from relevant parties yesterday: (1) In addition to the authorities ordering and transporting food oil from Dalian and other places to Shanghai for relief, they also supply raw materials to oil mills in Shanghai, such as soybeans, rapeseed, peanuts, cottonseed, sesame, etc. The oil produced by each factory is uniformly purchased and centrally distributed. (2) Due to the reduction of sugar reserves, the authorities ordered sugar from Taiwan and other places to transport it to Shanghai for relief. Therefore, there is no shortage panic of sugar in Shanghai. According to the quota of 16,000 bags per month, the cooperative is responsible for distributing sugar to households and special allocations for various industries.</p>
<p>The 38th Batch of Flour Was Sold Yesterday</p>
<p>After the 38th batch of household rice in the two concessions was sold on the 11th, the household flour of the same batch (each person can purchase 1 city catty at a price of 4.9 yuan) also began to be sold yesterday (13th). At the same time, according to the reporter of Datong News Agency, the 10th batch of household flour in Shanghai West has also been sold since the previous day, and each person is allowed to purchase 2.5 city catties at a price of 12.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The Third Batch of Oil and Sugar Will End Tomorrow</p>
<p>After the third batch of household oil and sugar in the city started selling on the 5th and 6th of this month, the third batch of household sugar in the Shanghai West District was sold in the first and third two squares, and the second square was slightly delayed due to procedural reasons. It is reported that the third batch of sugar purchase certificates has been completely issued yesterday (13th), and the citizens of the square can take this sugar certificate to the designated sugar retail store to receive half a city catty of sugar at a price of 2.35 yuan. It is noted that the current batch of household oil and sugar is scheduled to stop selling at 6:00 pm on the 15th.</p>
<p>There is a Continuous Supply of Broad Beans</p>
<p>The Grain Group of this city has been assigned by the Military Distribution Association to a large number of soybeans, green beans, and broad beans. Although the prices have been approved for free sale, they can still be applied for allocation. Therefore, grocery stores, tofu stores, soybean milk stalls, sauce gardens, fried goods stores, bean product stores, and bean sprout stores can still choose freely for broad beans, except that soybeans must still be matched with green beans. As in the past, they can register, pay, and ship at the place. The official prices are 520 yuan in storage certificates per city dan (dan price) for soybeans and green beans, and 350 yuan per city dan for broad beans, and the bags must be returned.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Plan to Ban Gambling is About to Be Realized: The Request to Close Gambling Dens May Be Approved: Expected to be Cleared Within Eight Months</h3>
<p>It is learned that Shanghai will start a large-scale campaign to ban smoking and gambling in the shortest possible time, which will be presided over by the Japanese authorities and Mayor Chen of this port. According to a proponent of the movement, the two evils of smoking and gambling are enough to cause other crimes and cause social weakness. Therefore, if you want to guide people's livelihood into the right track, you must ban smoking and gambling, curb speculative psychology, and eliminate laziness. The member recently inquired about news from Chen and officials of the Japanese military police and the Works Bureau, and learned that the plan to ban smoking and gambling will be implemented in the near future. At the same time, it was also revealed that the request to close smoking dens and gambling places will soon be approved by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. At that time, the public will be asked to report secret smoking and gambling places. The large-scale work to ban smoking and gambling is scheduled to be carried out in eight months and is divided into four stages, with each stage lasting two months. Finally, it was also declared that once smoking and gambling are banned, Shanghai will pay attention to the elimination of other crimes.</p>
<h3>China Railway Company Agrees to Transport Relief Grain for Free to the North: Raw Wheat and Corn Flour for Relief is Being Negotiated: The Hotel Industry Donates a Full Day's Room Fee for One Day</h3>
<p>It is heard that the Shanghai All Walks of Life North China Relief Association has reached an agreement with the China Railway Company to transport relief food for free, so that it can be continuously transported to the area to help the famine. All donations from all walks of life, no matter how large or small, are expected to be sent directly to the designated major banks and money houses, so that formal receipts can be obtained.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yipeng Suggests Two Points: Since the establishment of the North China Relief Association, it has been very effective in raising funds. However, the needs of the disaster area are mainly food. Therefore, how to purchase a large amount of food with the relief funds raised is the most urgent task at present. At the same time, preparations must be made in advance for the food production in the disaster area next year. In view of this, Mr. Zhang Yipeng suggested two points to the Relief Association: (1) There is a kind of raw wheat in the Suhang area, with an annual output of more than 10,000 dans. This raw wheat is only used by the locals to make raw wheat liquor and is not used for other purposes. Moreover, raw wheat liquor is also the worst kind of liquor. If the production of liquor can be stopped for one year, and this raw wheat is used as relief food, the victims will benefit greatly. At the time of the current wheat harvest, if a detailed investigation can be conducted and purchased, a part of the relief food can be solved. (2) There is a kind of corn flour in the food, which is a special product of the Netherlands, and Germany also has it. Corn flour has a special feature, that is, whether it is dry land, water land, or wasteland, wherever other organisms cannot grow, only corn flour can grow. It is three feet high and can be harvested three months after planting. It is the most suitable plant for the disaster area. German military food is mostly corn flour, and Japan also has it. If seeds can be obtained and transplanted to the disaster area, there is no need to worry about the famine next year. The Relief Association has accepted the above opinions and sent personnel to contact the Grain Department. It is also learned that the Hebei Shanghai Fellow Association continued to hold famous actors and amateurs broadcasting yesterday at the French radio station, and the results were good, surpassing the first and second days. The actual amount of money received remains to be counted and announced today. As for the Great World, it has been scheduled to hold a charity performance today, and all the income of the day will be allocated as relief funds.</p>
<p>The Hotel Industry Regularly Charges Room Fees for Relief: The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association held a meeting with the industry to discuss emergency relief for the disaster in North China, and decided that the full day's room fee income on the 15th of this month will be used as a relief donation, and a soliciting team will be appointed to promote it separately. After the donations are collected, they will be sent to the disaster relief association for publication in the newspaper to show good faith.</p>
<h3>Special Self-Police Corps Organization Law: Organized by Designated Places: Work Does Not Have to Hinder Original Duties</h3>
<p>In addition to the regular police officers, the Public Concession originally had Self-Police Corps to assist in maintaining order. Now, in order to meet the actual needs, the police stations in each district have instructed the buildings, newspapers, companies, shops, hotels, and public places in their jurisdiction to organize special Self-Police Corps separately, specializing in indoor order and security. In this way, the ordinary Self-Police Corps on the street will complement each other, and the effect can be achieved with half the effort.</p>
<p>Designated Places Organize Themselves: The details of the organization method and service method of the Special Self-Police Corps were learned by the reporter of Guofeng News Agency from the competent department of the Police Headquarters as follows: (1) The Special Self-Police Corps is organized by the places designated by the police station. The members are selected from the employees of the place. The number is determined according to the size of the place and the number of employees. The corps has a chief who is in charge of everything. (2) The Special Self-Police Corps must be formed within the time limit set by the police station. Before starting service, the total number of employees, the name of the person in charge of the Self-Police Corps, the number of Self-Police Corps members, the number of Self-Police Corps shifts, and the number of people in each shift shall be reported to the police station in charge. (3) The Special Self-Police Corps shall prepare red and white armbands. The armbands shall be made by the designated places themselves, numbered, and sealed by the police station in charge before they are valid.</p>
<p>Indoor Patrol to Prevent Unexpected Events: (4) The Special Self-Police Corps works in shifts day and night, specializing in indoor patrols and maintaining public order. When on duty, they shall wear the armbands and pay close attention to all activities in the room and people entering and leaving to prevent criminals from mixing in to disturb or engage in terrorist acts. (5) The red armbands prepared by the Special Self-Police Corps are not allowed to be worn outside. They are limited to being collected from the person in charge when on duty and returned when off duty. Except when going out due to chasing terrorist criminals from indoors, (6) If a terrorist act occurs in the Special Self-Police Corps room, the door shall be closed immediately to prohibit anyone from entering or leaving, and the police station in charge shall be reported to suppress it. (7) The work of the Special Self-Police Corps shall be based on the principle of not hindering the original work. They may continue to perform their original duties as usual and patrol the various places in the room from time to time within the specified time. Special attention shall be paid to the corners of the room that are not easily noticed by people.</p>

<h3>Modern Japanese Painting Exhibition to be Held at the Dasin Company Art Gallery from the 15th to the 20th</h3>
<p>At the juncture of constructing a New East Asia, the integration of Chinese and Japanese culture is becoming increasingly close. With the support of the Imperial Art Academy, the Japan International Cultural Promotion Society is holding a public exhibition of famous modern Japanese paintings in China to celebrate the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital and to solidify cultural cooperation between the two countries. This exhibition aims to introduce Japanese art and culture to the Chinese people, enabling them to gain a deeper understanding. Modern Japanese painting exhibitions are being held in Nanjing, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. In Shanghai, the event is supported by various Chinese and Japanese organizations, including the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Japanese Embassy, the Shanghai Office of the Publicity Department of the Shanghai Office, and the Japanese Imperial Art Academy. The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association is also providing assistance. The exhibition is scheduled to open to the public on the 15th of this month at the Art Gallery on the fourth floor of the Dasin Company on Nanjing Road. The exhibition will last for six days, ending on the 20th of this month. It is said that the exhibition will feature over sixty items, all carefully crafted masterpieces by Japan's top artists and treasures from the Japanese Ministry of Education. These are extremely valuable items that are rarely seen in ordinary times. This is the first time they have been brought to Shanghai for exhibition, making it a rare opportunity. It is also learned that the association will hold a preview at the Dasin Art Gallery today (the 14th) to invite leaders and celebrities from various Chinese and Japanese circles in the city to visit, and special invitations have been widely distributed. The public exhibition will open on the 15th, welcoming anyone to visit without the need for admission tickets. A large turnout is expected.</p>
<p>Brief Description of Works: One of the greatest characteristics of modern Japanese painting is that it reveals the "genius of the Japanese people in building a great modern nation on a foundation of venerable tradition." This is manifested in the flourishing of the arts, and can be said to be a uniquely Japanese "creative adaptability." Japanese painters, while acknowledging the dignity of the classics, also seek to infuse the scientific and formative character of modernity, opening up new avenues in design, brushwork, and coloration. In this way, brushstrokes and hues give a modern character to the artistic creation of Greater Asia, standing in a guiding position. A brief description of the participating painters and their works in this exhibition is provided below:</p>
<p>Takenouchi Seiho: Member of the Imperial Art Academy. He passed away last year at the age of ninety. His style is not mere realism, but requires understanding his austere and detached spirit (Work No. 1).</p>
<p>Yokoyama Taikan: Member of the Imperial Art Academy, member of the Japan Art Institute. The Japanese spirit and the Greater East Asia spirit are entrusted to Mount Fuji, forming a grand vision and giving people a sense of the dawn of Greater Asia (Work No. 2).</p>
<p>Kawai Gyokudo: Member of the Imperial Art Academy. Together with the two artists mentioned above, he stands at the highest peak of the Japanese art world. In his paintings, one can savor the elegant Oriental flavor of mountain village autumn scenery (Work No. 3).</p>

<p>White Reeds</p>
<h3>Huang Ma</h3>
<p>— Feng Da Wen</p>
<p>Huang Ma was a maid in Lane 24. She was just over forty, but her hair was already streaked with gray. She had a kind face, but her movements always showed a capable air. She had been with her master for eight or nine years. Honesty, loyalty, and amiability were her characteristics. She got along with everyone, so almost everyone in the lane knew her—and knew she was a good person.</p>
<p>She was very busy. Every day—even in the coldest weather—she had to get up at four in the morning. Then she would light the coal stove, wipe tables, and dust benches... Her hands and feet never stopped until the evening, when she still had to serve the madams playing cards. There was never a moment to rest, and even though her wages had been increased several times, they were still only ten dollars a month. But she didn't complain, always blaming her own bad luck. Hoping to have a more comfortable future, she wanted to do more good deeds—which made her even more famous as a good person.</p>
<p>She was from Hangzhou. Her husband had died more than ten years ago, leaving behind a son who had been an apprentice in a cloth shop before the war. Later, he went missing due to the war and had not returned to this day. Otherwise, he would be twenty-three years old this year. This event had made Huang Ma cry for days and nights. It still hung heavy on her mind, often bringing tears to her eyes. She hoped her son would return safely, both to carry on the Huang family line and to allow her to enjoy some happiness. So she often fantasized about happiness, dreaming of paradise.</p>
<p>But, "Sitting and waiting won't bring it to your door! You have to work hard yourself," this truth suddenly dawned on her. After that, she began to work hard.</p>
<p>She put in a lot of research and realized that to be happy and fortunate, the first thing you needed was money. The wages from her employer weren't even enough to spend, and she wouldn't be able to save up enough in a lifetime. She had to think of a way to get rich. So she often kept an eye out on the street for dropped wallets or other items that could make her a small fortune. But she was disappointed. So she had to change her approach and think of another way.</p>
<p>Sure enough, she found a tool that could bring her great wealth—charity lottery tickets. When she first heard that the first prize was five hundred thousand dollars, she felt like she had discovered a shortcut to wealth, and was as happy as if she had already won the first prize. She continued to inquire about the price of each ticket and then started to buy one. She wrapped it carefully in a black handkerchief and put it in the pocket of her underwear, sewing the pocket shut with thread.</p>
<p>"Wow—there might be five hundred thousand dollars in here, I can't lose it—"</p>
<p>She calculated: "If I win the first prize, no, even if it's the second prize, that would be great! I'll definitely rent a front room to live in by myself, and I'll have to find a way to get my only son back. Also, these clothes are so tattered that they can't even be patched anymore, I want to make a new set. I have to be thrifty usually, this money can be used for old age, and I can even buy a burial shroud and coffin in advance."</p>
<p>She had memorized the ninth day of the month for the drawing. The first, second, third... her heart was so anxious, but time seemed to pass so slowly.</p>
<p>On the ninth day, she couldn't sleep early in the morning, waiting anxiously for the five hundred thousand dollar first prize. She specially spent seven cents to buy a Shen Bao newspaper and asked the character-reading master at the entrance of the lane to check it for her.</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Really no? Not even the second or third prize?" She didn't believe it and took it home again, asking her employer's son to check it again. But the result was again: "No!"</p>
<p>She wasn't discouraged by this. In the future, she would save money and spend less, taking out two dollars from her wages each month to buy a few more tickets, hoping to win eventually. She bought them for more than half a year, but never won anything, not even the last prize. She counted the old lottery tickets she had saved, and there were already five of them.</p>
<p>"Ting! This is a scam, is it really impossible to win even once? I'll never buy them again."</p>
<p>One clear morning, around seven thirty, Huang Ma took a small vegetable basket, got ten dollars from her employer, and went to the vegetable market. At the corner of An'nan Road, a crowd of people was gathered. She walked over out of curiosity. It was a gambling stall. She stopped and saw a person standing opposite her take out five dollars, bet it, and immediately turn it into ten dollars; then it became twenty dollars.</p>
<p>Money! Money was tempting her! "Isn't this a good way to get rich!"</p>
<p>She very readily reached out, took out ten dollars, and bet it. Sure enough, it turned into twenty dollars. She prepared to turn around and leave, but a person standing next to her, with a stern face, blocked her way. "Bet again! You'll definitely win!"</p>
<p>"Okay! I'll bet one more time!" She thought she might as well win a little more.</p>
<p>But this time, it wasn't as smooth as the last time. All twenty dollars slipped into the hands of the dealer. Her body trembled, and she looked at the twenty dollars very reluctantly. She took out the only ten dollars she had saved for a long time from her pocket, and bet it again. She said a sentence of "Amitabha" in her heart, praying silently. But where did the Bodhisattva have the power to help—she lost again!</p>
<p>She walked away, without a single penny on her. She couldn't buy vegetables, so she had to go to a friend's house and borrow twenty dollars, preparing to buy vegetables again.</p>
<p>But when she passed by the gambling stall, she couldn't help but feel envious again, wanting to win back the money she had just lost. She decided to bet one more time. At first, she waited for a while, watching the numbers that had come out several times, and then solemnly put down the twenty dollars again. Her heart was filled with chaotic thoughts, only waiting for the judgment of fate.</p>
<p>"Eat!" Unfortunately, she lost again.</p>
<p>A blur appeared before her eyes, and her body began to tremble uncontrollably. Forty dollars! What a large amount! It was a full four months' wages—she calculated that her daily, mechanical life was already enough to make her suffer. For these forty dollars, she had to work for four more months; she thought it was terrible, four months requiring her to work like a cow or horse every day!</p>
<p>In the past, she had endured everything, feeling that as long as she persevered, the light ahead would come! Now, she was disappointed, and even more so, she thought of her lost son; in this life, her whole life, there would be no hope!</p>
<p>"What's the point of living?" She couldn't help but ask this question!</p>
<p>Returning home, she threw the empty vegetable basket on the table, walked to the counter, found a rope, tied it to the bamboo pole, and without hesitation, put it around her neck, ending her life.</p>

<h3>Joy in Fantasy</h3>
<p>— Hu Ming Yang</p>
<p>Isn't this spring?</p>
<p>Everything is so beautiful.</p>
<p>Let us stroll in the spring wilderness,</p>
<p>And be temporarily intoxicated by the spring breeze.</p>
<p>We see the world destroyed beside us,</p>
<p>Time disappearing around us.</p>
<p>This space-time is irrelevant to us,</p>
<p>We are ignorant of this space-time.</p>
<p>We are leisurely strolling,</p>
<p>Vaguely rejoicing,</p>
<p>This realm is so blurred:</p>
<p>But who beautified all this?</p>
<p>"An indescribable emotion."</p>
<h3>Letters from a Small Building</h3>
<p>— Yan Ping</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Friend: Outside the window, a bleak wind and bitter rain are falling, and my heart is also kneaded into a chaotic mess. I feel suffocated and can't breathe. I want to confide in you, to pour out that supreme grief. I want to cry; cry for that miserable life. Bear with me and listen to a few words! You know that our classroom window faces the morgue. Whenever the professor teaches, we often encounter sorrowful rhythms, especially today. I will never forget a scene: When the biology teacher was talking about how to solve the "mystery of life," suddenly a tragic horn sounded. Friend, you will never imagine how tragic this horn was. Our whole classroom was stunned. A ripple of emotion stirred in my heart. I looked out the window. Yes, I saw this scene: In front of the morgue, a funeral parlor car and a bicycle carrying a coffin were parked. A ragged old woman covered her face and wept bitterly. Next to her, two young men in suits were strolling leisurely. Two bodies were carried out. One was put into the car, and then the two young men followed. The car sped away, and the other body was put into the coffin. Only the old woman sat alone in the rickshaw, the horn following... It was such a simple scene, friend! Perhaps you think it's a very ordinary thing, but I remembered Dostoevsky's "Poor People." I was dazed until the end of the class. I can't erase this scene. The wind and rain are getting heavier. Friend, can you tell me for sure what the mystery of life is?</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Friend: How painful is the heart of a person whose life is empty. I drink cup after cup of bitter wine, and tears run down my face, but I don't know when it will end. You say I'm sick, but I don't know what sickness is. I wander in front of the hospital ward every day, wanting to explore what sickness is. When I stood at the entrance of the mental hospital, suddenly a woman with disheveled hair rushed out. She stared at me. Her hair covered her face. Her figure still showed her beauty. She grabbed my hand, "Haha! Don't be a decent person, haha, it's not good to die poor..." I was shocked and stunned. My mind was a little dizzy, until the nurse pulled her away. She was a madwoman, but friend! In the soul of this madwoman, I saw the pure and supreme sincerity of mankind. You say that the hypocritical faces in the world are clear-headed? If that's really the case, then I'm willing to be a madman, I'm willing to enter the hospital, friend! Please tell me.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Friend: The heavy wind and rain are still falling, and sorrow presses on my heart, it's about to crush me. Yesterday, I ran alone to the Bund. On the pier, I faced the river wind, wanting to wake myself up. A freighter was docking, and the crane was creaking, loading packages of goods onto the pier. "Hen yu! Hen yu!" The dockworkers' faces were strained. But I found an old man, he was so thin, his body shaking, the rope cutting into his bony shoulder. His pale face showed a flush, but friend! What a terrible scene! Blood suddenly gushed out of his mouth, sweat covered his forehead, he collapsed under the rope, the goods pressing on his chest. Now his face turned so pale and terrible, his protruding eyeballs staring at people, blood flowing from the corners of his mouth. He lay quietly on the corner of the road. Another young man took his place. A man with a whip glanced at him and snorted, "Overestimating yourself..." Although he was carried onto the ambulance], but: friend! Can you imagine this tragic scene? I ran back madly, but that gaunt face with sweat and blood... Friend! Is there such sorrow in life?</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Friend: Let me tell you another story that happened at the same time on the pier! A rough, dark-faced man and a companion were carrying a package of goods together. As they approached the exit to get the receipt, suddenly there was a sound of "pat, pat!" I saw a hand, the hand grabbed the cotton bale, grabbed the white cotton and hid it in his arms, sweat flowing on his forehead, but he was wearing a cotton jacket. Now the receipt was coming to him, his clothes were stripped, and inside were clumps of cotton, "pat, pat!" Purple and black welts rose on his muscles. His face, which had been expressionless, endured everything. When a foot kicked him and a shout of "Get out!" was heard, he seemed to wake up, tears flowing in his eyes, "Sir! I won't do it again next time, please help me, spare me." But the expressionless eyes did not blink. He begged, kneeling at his feet, "I still have an old mother, wife, and children at home..." "Get out!" With a shout of dismissal, he stood up hopelessly, looked at his companions with a pitiful expression, sighed, and walked out of the pier, a fallen figure disappearing. Friend! My tears were so many, filling my eyes. I want to ask you, is life really a struggle?</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Friend: The dark night swallowed everything, the dim street lights, I walked silently in the dark corner, suddenly: "Sir! Our girl is still young, please help us!" I turned around and saw the procuress giving that nightingale a fierce look, and then a small, thin hand, "Sir..." These intermittent words contained many imaginable words, my heart trembled, I looked at her eyes, her eyes filled with tears, glittering eyelashes, a color of plea for help. I respected and strengthened myself, broke free and went forward, "Alas!" A distant sigh came.</p>
<p>Friend! Do you know how sad I feel in my heart? There, perhaps, there are countless sacred souls, oppressed faces, huge shackles binding them, no struggle, no resistance, only enduring and swallowing tears, waiting for people to slaughter them. They pretend to smile, using their own hands to always pull and pull, when can they not drink this bitter wine? When can they be liberated? They will forever be tormented by poison, their lives ravaged, unpitied, unloved, they are nightingales despised by people, forever living in another world, friend! Is life always in different worlds?</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>Friend: Two days of loneliness. I like to listen to stories. Last night, I heard such a story. The wilderness is barren, without trees, without green grass, and the soil is cracked. Countless people, with outstretched hands, are crying, struggling, tree bark, grass roots, Guanyin clay,... the flesh of corpses! One by one, they are gaunt, floating, collapsing,... snatching other people's children, closing the door and cooking them to eat, or exchanging them for one,... the wilderness is full of skeletons, ghosts,... what can be eaten is eaten, and then in the barren land, they raise their hands to the sky... Friend! We at least still have pancakes and fried dough sticks! Outside the window, it seems that countless ghosts are crying out to us...</p>

<h3>Random Notes on "Wine"</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>People who don't drink well frown when they take a sip of wine, as if they're eating bitter medicine. People who love wine see drinking as the greatest pleasure in life, it's really strange. But what kind of pleasure is there in drinking wine, no one can say. The Jin Shu states: "Meng Jia was Huan Wen's military advisor and liked to drink. Wen asked what was so good about wine, and why he was so fond of it? He replied: 'You have not yet understood the pleasure in wine.'" He was being mysterious and didn't reveal the secret. Bai Juyi has a poem: "Waiting for the chrysanthemums to bloom and the fine wine to mature, to get drunk with you and be in harmony with nature." Emperor Wen of Wei wrote to Wu Zhi: "When we are drunk and our ears are hot, we look up and write poems, at this time, we don't know the joy." He still didn't say what the pleasure was.</p>
<p>Perhaps drinking can eliminate worries and anxieties and forget everything, which is the "pleasure in wine." Bai Juyi's poem says: "The common folk call it a sorrow-relieving medicine (referring to wine), nothing is faster. One cup drives away worldly worries, another cup restores harmony with nature, three cups and you are drunk, sometimes laughing, sometimes singing wildly, in a daze. Who knows what else?" With this effect, most frustrated people like to drink. Li Bai's poem says: "To eliminate eternal sorrow with you." It's the so-called borrowing wine to drown sorrows. Listen, Chen Xuan said to his nephew Xiu Jun: "I am lonely in this world, suffering from illness and old age, my property is no different from Yan Yuan, and my name has not moved the ministers of state. If I don't drink pure wine, where else can I go?" This is definitely borrowing wine to drown sorrows. Tao Yuanming was unwilling to bow for five dou of rice, resigned and returned to his hometown, and wrote the Returning Home, which says: "Leading the children into the room, there is a pot of wine, I lift the pot and drink by myself, gazing at the trees in the courtyard with joy." He lived a life of leisure. He has a poem that says: "How can I express my feelings, I will muddle through with turbid wine, no one will know for a thousand years, I will use it to celebrate today." It can be seen that his full of complaints were all vented into the cup.</p>
<p>Men of letters and wine have an inextricable bond. Perhaps it's because wine can stimulate the nerves and excite the "Inspiration." The most heavy drinker was the poet Li Bai. According to Du Fu's poem: "Li Bai writes a hundred poems with a dou of wine, sleeps in the wine shop in Chang'an, the Emperor calls him but he doesn't get on the boat, claiming to be a wine immortal." It is said that Li Bai was in the Hanlin Academy, writing drafts for the emperor's edicts, but he was addicted to alcohol and often indulged in drinking. Sometimes, when the Emperor issued a decree, he was drunk and could not wait. The attendants splashed water on his face to wake him up a little, and then ordered him to pick up the pen. Soon, he would finish it, and the Emperor admired his talent. Getting so drunk is a feat only he in history could achieve. But in the end, because he offended Gao Lishi when he was drunk, his bad luck began, and he spent the second half of his life in poverty and wandering, writing those good poems: "Living in the world is like a great dream, why work so hard to live? So I get drunk all day long, and lie down against the front pillar." "A pot of wine among the flowers, drinking alone without anyone to accompany me, I raise my cup to invite the bright moon, facing my shadow, there are three of us." What a touching poetic scene of wine.</p>
<p>The multi-talented Su Dongpo was also a lover of wine. There are many places in his poems where he talks about wine. His Nangezi poem says: "After waking up from the Maojiu wine, I'm still sleepy, the dream of the immortal village can't be realized... Bringing wine to Hengshan in the rain, sleeping late in the evening with my clothes on, I don't know when the bells and drums announce dawn, in my dream I become a butterfly and feel light..." How tasteful it is. If drinking wine always brings this feeling, everyone would be willing to have a few drinks.</p>
<p>Today, people drink wine and only know how to play guessing games. The ancients liked wine orders, but because they were too civilized, they were not popular. According to Zhang Bangji's Zhuangmanlu of the Song Dynasty, "At the banquet, they carved wooden figures, sharpened their bottoms, and placed them on a plate. They tilted left and right like dancing, and when their strength was exhausted, they fell. Depending on where the carved figures fell, they would reward the person there with a cup of wine, called Quanjin Hu." This has disappeared today. In Zhu Genglu compiled by Ming Zongyi, there is an even more romantic record: "Yang Tieya was fond of music and women. Whenever he saw a singing girl or dancing girl with small feet, he would take off her shoes and carry the wine cups on them, calling it the Golden Lotus Cup." In modern people's eyes, three-inch golden lotuses wearing embroidered shoes are already not aesthetically pleasing, so taking them to carry the wine cups would be nauseating. I wonder if today's dance fans would also take the dancing girl's high heels to carry the wine?</p>
<p>It is said that in ancient times, they used a bird's feather to make wine, called Jiu Jiu, which was extremely poisonous. Many loyal ministers and martyrs committed suicide with it when they failed. But it is also said that there is a kind of wine that will not kill you after drinking it. It is said that in the past, the Xiangshan Mountain on Junshan Mountain had fine wine, and drinking it would make you immortal. So it moved the heart of Emperor Wu of Han, and he ordered Yao Ba to seek it. The result was naturally successful, but before it was presented to the emperor, it was stolen and eaten by the witty Dongfang Shuo. Emperor Wu was furious and wanted to kill him, but the witty man calmly said, "If the wine is effective, killing me will not kill me; if it is not effective, what is the use of the wine?" He said it so humorously! Emperor Wu didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Dongfang Shuo, with the courtesy name of Manqian, was a servant of Emperor Wu of Han, and his words were full of interest, often admonishing Emperor Wu in a humorous tone. Stupid and selfish emperors sometimes do need humor like Manqian's to correct their mistakes.</p>
<p>Regarding drinking wine, there are also a few strange stories, originally recorded in the Taiping Guangji: Yuan Dai did not drink, but he would get drunk from the smell alone. Later, he met an extraordinary person who used a needle to pick out a small worm from the tip of his nose, saying: "This is the wine bug." That day, he drank a dou of wine. There is also the Tang Zhong Shiyi's record: Jiao Sui (who was good at drinking and was known as one of the Eight Immortals of Wine) stuttered and could not say a word to guests, but after getting drunk, he could answer like a stream, and was called Jiu Chi at the time. There is also Zhang Xu, a famous calligrapher of the Tang Dynasty, who liked to drink, and after getting drunk, he would call out and run wildly, and then pick up the pen and write in a flamboyant style. Later generations called him the Sage of Cursive Script.</p>
<p>I always thought that drinking wine was an elegant or despondent pastime. If you think you are noble and a poet or a refined person, or at least think you are a hero like Qiu Ran Ke or Wu Song, then you have to learn to drink several dou at a time, getting drunk. Usually, if a person wants to use a clear mind to do something for his family and society, he should not associate with drunkenness. You must understand that alcohol is anesthetic. After drinking, the nerves are stimulated and the circulation of blood is accelerated, resulting in involuntary excitement, which is more likely to spoil things than to accomplish them. Some people think that they can drown their sorrows with wine, but it is only temporary. After sobering up, they feel more sad and suffer even more. Alcohol is also corrosive. After drinking, the blood vessels of the stomach wall are eroded and soaked in alcohol. As a result, the cells swell, and after a long time, they will be poisoned and the blood vessels will harden, causing a lot of damage.</p>
<p>Let us recite the poems and prose of ancient and modern men of letters about drunkenness. It is enough to appreciate the poetic taste of wine, so why drink to the point of being drunk, like a drunkard?</p>

<h3>The Problem of Reorganizing Small Banks</h3>
<p>The National Government has recently spared no effort in actively promoting its financial control policy. First, it transferred the bill clearing institution to the Central Bank to complete the central bank in name and reality, thereby increasing its prestige. Now, it is conducting concrete research on the issue of reorganizing small banks, which is truly a welcome development in the advancement of the National Government's financial policy.</p>
<p>According to general rumors, the National Government's approach to small banks requires a minimum capital of three million yuan to strengthen the banks' substance, which would be quite effective in the reorganization effort. Given today's price levels, a capital of one or two million yuan is indeed insufficient for a bank to fully function. It is only natural that the National Government authorities are focusing on increasing capital.</p>
<p>However, it would be a mistake to assume that the substance of small banks will rapidly improve simply by increasing capital. It is essential to understand that increasing capital is only the first step in the solution. The important issue lies in how to normalize banking operations and allow banks to perform their original functions. Increasing capital is not particularly difficult, but if the business becomes abnormal after the capital increase, it will create an even more complex and difficult situation. Therefore, we must be particularly cautious about this.</p>
<p>From this perspective, relying solely on the amount of a bank's capital as a standard is not the most appropriate in practice. It would be more effective to conduct a thorough observation of the deposit content. This is worth noting in the bank reorganization strategy, and it also represents a further expectation for the National Government's implementation of financial policy.</p>
<p>The reorganization of small banks will undoubtedly involve many difficulties and complexities in its implementation. We hope that the National Government authorities will overcome these with the greatest enthusiasm and effort. The future should be one of smooth coordination. In addition to placing high hopes on the National Government's proactive efforts, we also hope that the financial community can exercise self-discipline and assist in order to achieve tangible results.

<h3>Bank of Communications to Handle Rural Investment Loans; Requests Government to Provide Funds and Grant Exclusive Operating Rights</h3>
<p>The Bank of Communications was ordered to launch agricultural loans and added an Agricultural Economics Department within the bank on May 5th of this year, dedicated to handling agricultural finance business. Based on the initial survey results of the rural economic conditions in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai, the designated agricultural finance business policy includes: (1) improving rural economic conditions, (2) increasing agricultural production, and assisting in agricultural promotion and extension, (3) guiding farmers to establish self-managed and self-enjoyed financial systems and institutions, and (4) supporting the establishment of owner-farmers. Currently, it is actively proceeding step by step according to the policy. In the initial stage of implementation, it plans to focus on rural credit and production cooperative loans. A reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the actual extent of the bank's handling of agricultural loans, specifically inquired about the details from the bank's Agricultural Economics Department, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Establishing Four Management and Investment Offices</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Agricultural Economics Department, the bank originally targeted cooperatives for rural loans. However, because the cooperatives in various rural areas have been dissolved, it was decided to send personnel to Dongtai in northern Jiangsu, Wuhu in Anhui, and Jiaxing in Zhejiang to establish agricultural economics offices to handle rural investment and loan matters before a sound organization of cooperatives is in place in various locations. Each office will administer the loan business of three to four counties, and it must be prepared and established within two months.</p>
<p>Starting Investment and Business Loans</p>
<p>The bank recently accepted requests from agricultural organizations near Shanghai, and in areas such as northern Jiangsu and Wuxi, to first handle loans for cotton merchants, pig farming loans, agricultural technology loans, agricultural tool manufacturing loans, farmland management, and other business loans. After sending personnel for a second on-site investigation, it was determined that there is an urgent need for capital adjustment, so loans have been approved, totaling 12 million yuan, and lending has begun.</p>
<p>Requesting Exclusive Agricultural Loan Operating Rights</p>
<p>In order to promote agricultural economic policies and fulfill the mission of establishing a rural financial system and institutions, the bank has specially submitted a request to the government for (1) exclusive operating rights for agricultural finance business, (2) provision of funds, and (3) compensation for net losses. It is reported that the bank's intention to request the government to grant exclusive operating rights for agricultural finance business is to adapt to the government's implementation of wartime economic policies, actively increase production, and further guide central farmer organizations to establish cooperative credit unions in various counties and cities. Therefore, the bank's agricultural finance business is different from ordinary business and is not aimed at making profits. As for the recent rumors that various banks and firms are forming a rural loan syndicate with the Bank of Communications as the center, this is completely contrary to the facts, which the bank authorities have denied.</p>
<h3>Regulations Approved for Discounting Bank and Firm Deposit Reserves</h3>
<p>The Bankers Association, in order to regulate the finances of its members, has agreed with the Central Reserve Bank that the deposit reserve funds paid by various banks and firms may be used as collateral for discounting. With the guarantee of the Bankers Association, they may apply to the Central Reserve Bank for discounting and turnover. The details of the discounting method are as follows: (1) Using deposit reserves as collateral for discounting is limited to banks and firms that have paid all of their deposit reserves in cash. Those who use cash substitutes for 46% of the deposit are not included. (2) The amount of the discount is limited to a maximum of 80% of the reserve funds paid. (3) Applications for discounting should be made using the seven-day promissory notes of the respective banks and firms. (4) Applications for discounting from banks and firms should be accompanied by a separate letter of certification from the Bankers Association, proving that the loan is indeed for the purpose of providing temporary funding and should not be used for other hoarding or speculation purposes.</p>
<p>Reserve Funds Fully Paid</p>
<p>In accordance with the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Financial Institutions and the Detailed Rules for Implementation, various banks and firms have paid their deposit reserves into the reserve accounts opened with the Central Reserve Bank. The required deposit reserve is (1) 5% or more for fixed deposits and special current deposits, and (2) 10% or more for current deposits. The payment reserves for the aforementioned deposits are determined according to the balance at the end of each month and must be made before the end of each month. Since June of this year, all reserves for fixed, special current, and current deposits have been paid in full in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Conducting Semi-Annual Settlements</p>
<p>Silver and money firms have scheduled to conduct the semi-annual settlement on June 30th. In accordance with the law, at the end of each business year, they are required to prepare a business report, balance sheet, inventory of assets, and profit and loss statement within three months, which will be submitted to the Central Reserve Bank and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that various firms are preparing to conduct the semi-annual settlement, urging the return of funds due in six months, and continuing to facilitate lending for the purchase of agricultural products, provided that borrowers provide guarantees to avoid fueling speculation and hoarding.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Consumer Cooperative to Close Stock Subscription Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Leaders from all sectors of the city, including financial, industrial, and commercial leaders, in view of frequent price increases and the difficulty of making a living, have initiated the establishment of the "Shanghai Citizens' Consumer Cooperative." This is to collect major commodities in bulk and distribute them to members on a regular basis. Since the start of the stock subscription, approximately 40,000 shares have been subscribed. The Bank of China and the Shanghai Bank have been designated to collect the payments for shares. In order to expedite the process, the cooperative has distributed notices to all shareholders to pay their dues. It was learned yesterday that the stock subscription will close tomorrow (the 15th). All sectors are requested to complete the membership procedures within the next two days.</p>
<h3>Industry Association News</h3>
<p>Glassware Industry Association Established Yesterday: The Shanghai Special Municipality Glassware Industry Association held its inaugural meeting at the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. More than 500 members attended. In addition to passing the association's constitution, they elected eleven directors, including Huang Ruliang and Bao Songnian, and five supervisors, including Chen Jianting and Mao Xiqing.</p>
<p>Machinery and Yarn Associations to Be Established Tomorrow: The Shanghai Machinery Factory and Yarn Store Associations have been ordered to organize and prepare and are scheduled to convene inaugural meetings tomorrow (the 15th). The Yarn Association meeting will be held at 9:30 AM, and the Machinery Association meeting will be held at 3:00 PM, both in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. At that time, the Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs and other relevant authorities will send representatives to attend and provide guidance.</p>
<p>Dispute Arises in Paint Association: There have been two paint associations in the city, one named "Western Paint Association" and the other named "Coarse and Fine Paint Sundries Association." The two associations were previously instructed by the competent authorities to merge and form the "Shanghai Special Municipality Paint Association." After the establishment of the new association, the original two associations should have been abolished. It has recently been learned that the person in charge of the former Coarse and Fine Paint Sundries Association suddenly had a dispute with the new association and is now petitioning the competent authorities for instructions on how to proceed.</p>

<h3>Opinions on Improving the Lives of Farmers in the Suburbs of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ma Jingnong</p>
<p>The lives of farmers are a major part of the national economy, and the soundness of farmers' lives greatly affects the strength of the nation. Today, as wars affect countries around the world, governments around the world are more concerned with and improving the lives of farmers than our country by several times: because the stability of farmers' lives and the increase or decrease in agricultural production directly reflect a country's wartime food policy. Therefore, improving farmers' lives is also an economic issue. In order to support the needs of long-term combat, we should often conduct extensive discussions on the concern for farmers' lives and the study of rural economics in the economic world.</p>
<p>Before the war, the lives of farmers in the four suburbs of Shanghai existed for the most part dependent on the city, because the population density and land were not enough to cultivate. Therefore, many farmers entered factories or participated in various production businesses, and women also used their remaining time to do many side jobs. In short, because farmers in the four suburbs of Shanghai did not have enough land to cultivate, in addition to planting some vegetables, miscellaneous grains, or flowers and fruits, most of them did not have the ability to be self-sufficient. After the war, because various factories closed one after another and urban life changed drastically, it directly affected their lives and exposed their own weaknesses. Especially in the last year or two, the suffering of farmers' lives in the four suburbs and the crisis of their future are even more unimaginable. Based on my own observations, I offer a few suggestions for the authorities or economic leaders to refer to in improving farmers' lives.</p>
<p>(1) Strictly Limit Land Sales: Although many farmers in the four suburbs feel that there is not enough land to cultivate, there are also quite a few people who own hundreds or thousands of acres of land. Because land is valuable, many real estate companies are engaged in the sale of land, as are local landowners or land brokers. Under such a degree of change, farmers who make a living from land are greatly harmed. Therefore, they are all living in a state of constant insecurity. The sale of land must be certified by the township head and the land bureau to take effect. However, there are many illegal sales or disputes, and even events that directly affect farmers' lives (such as the change of landowners and the increase of rent, etc.) are too numerous to mention. In order to stop the illegal sale of land and stabilize the lives of farmers, I hope that the authorities will use strict measures to restrict the sale of land and announce the implementation policy, otherwise, the use of farmers' lives in the four suburbs is very worrying.</p>
<p>(2) Organize Production and Sales Cooperative Institutions: China's agricultural production and sales originally had no organizational structure. Although there has been an indestructible tradition in the past, it has been affected by years of war and many difficulties that are difficult to reconcile. Therefore, the authorities need to give great power to improve the original production and sales mechanism into a cooperative form of mechanism. In the production aspect, try to use the existing agricultural professional talents in many agricultural farms to specialize in guiding improved farming, improved seeds, or improved animal husbandry and vegetables, and other agricultural affairs, in order to increase production. In the sales aspect, not only should the multi-faceted exploitation of brokers be improved, but the sales side should also purchase seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools to supply to farmers, seeking cooperation between production and sales. This not only reduces the difficulty for farmers in purchasing seeds and fertilizers, but also reduces the selling price of agricultural products. Although this matter is easier said than done, its importance is undeniable.</p>
<p>(3) Dredge Rivers and Abolish Various Unnecessary Tombs: There are few flowing rivers in the four suburbs of Shanghai, so in addition to a few more flowing rivers, most of them are silted ditches. When the rainfall is even, the irrigation of farmland can still cope. Once there is too much rain, such as the banks of the Yunzao River, it floods into almost a flood. Or, in the early years, such as the Hongqiao area, it was so dry that there was no place to drink water. Last year's drought and the high price of vegetables are clear evidence of this. I hope that the municipal council will investigate the circulation of rivers in the four suburbs and then dredge them to facilitate agricultural irrigation. The four suburbs are not enough for farming, but the Chinese maintain the tradition of tombs more than the hunger of life. If the land occupied by public cemeteries and charity tombs in various places in the four suburbs is calculated and changed for cultivation, perhaps it can maintain the lives of thousands of farmers. Therefore, if we can resolutely abolish various unnecessary tombs and rent them to farmers for cultivation, I don't think this is a meaningless thing.</p>
<p>(4) Increase Obligatory Agricultural Schools: Although Shanghai is the most culturally developed city, the number of illiterate people in the four suburbs of Shanghai is really shocking. According to what I know: In some villages concentrated in Yangxing to the south of Jiangwan Town, there were originally two or three hundred children who could be educated, but because of the lack of public elementary schools or because of economic poverty, only thirty or forty children were able to receive education. The authorities have already collected donations for the fields, so they cannot bear to sit idly by and watch many children drop out of school (there are certainly more children who have dropped out of school in various villages in the four suburbs). In order to eliminate illiteracy and popularize education, increasing obligatory agricultural schools or using the tea houses concentrated in various villages to run various educational lectures is really a matter that cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>Although food rations have been organized in the four suburbs, places like Hongqiao Town have not yet received such rations, so the lives of farmers in that area are more difficult than elsewhere. In addition to this, I hope that the wise municipal authorities will pay close attention to and improve the allocation of daily necessities and the supply of fertilizers.</p>
<p>Farmers in the four suburbs of Shanghai are living in extreme suffering. I hope that the wise and benevolent municipal authorities will choose to improve and save millions of farmers from the depths of suffering. (Moved to repay the loan scholarship)</p>

<h3>The Life of Work-Study Students</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>The hard-working spirit of work-study students is often praised, but their lives are the most painful of all.</p>
<p>When the three of us poor students started school, we asked the school to waive some tuition fees. The school actually agreed to waive all of them, but they wanted us to teach some classes in the attached elementary school. Tuition fees can be waived completely, and teaching is a sacred thing, so we all agreed without hesitation and became work-study students.</p>
<p>Both middle school and elementary school only have half-day classes. We study in the morning and teach elementary school students in the afternoon. There are four or five classes every day, taught in succession, with no time to rest. There are sixty or seventy students in a class, and we practically have to shout ourselves hoarse when teaching. When the class is over, we are naturally exhausted, but we still have to take a large stack of composition books or math practice books home.</p>
<p>At first, there was no remuneration—no, the waived tuition fees were the remuneration. After some time, after repeated requests, the school agreed to provide us with a basic lunch, because it was often too late to go home to eat and then rush back to school for class. In addition, the school also sympathized with our suffering and gave us 20 yuan a month, but the tasks also came with it. We had to copy lecture notes for the school (which students had to pay to buy after they were printed), and calculate scores for the students after the exams. (The overall average grade was calculated according to the percentage of how many courses there were per week). Our work was extremely heavy, and we couldn't be negligent in the slightest when copying and calculating scores. Driven by a sense of responsibility, we never slacked off for a moment.</p>
<p>Our work is as heavy as that of elementary school teachers—a few fewer classes, but with additional tasks. However, our treatment is still far from that of the poor and suffering elementary school teachers. After all, we are still students, with no family burdens.</p>
<p>The principal was afraid that we would make more requests, and repeatedly assured us that he would solve our schooling problems for the next semester, and also constantly encouraged us: "Young people should endure hardship!" "Enduring hardship is tempering!" "You need to accumulate more experience!" We couldn't find a job, and we also needed to study, so we could only endure this kind of life.</p>
<p>I heard that next semester the principal is going to dismiss all the remaining teachers in the elementary school and recruit a few more work-study students.</p>
