<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">我們的反省 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>六年前的今天，不幸的發生了蘆溝橋事變，如今雖前嫌漸釋，可是，渝共仍負嵎偏局，全面和平迄未實現；卽和平區內，尙有心存懷疑觀望者，若即若離，於是狡黠者趁勢撩錢，「自好」者絨口不言，社會風氣形成畸形混濁之態，國家建設遭受嚴重阻滯之勢。撫今追昔，良用慨然</p>
<p>我們回溯事變的起源，的有二端；其一是當時兩國朝野彼此認識不足，因此雙方國策失之毫厘謬以千里，各走極端，引起不幸之變。其二是英美帝國主義之陰謀，以及共產國際之煽動，竭盡挑撥離間的能事，使中日發生戰事，以遂漁人之利。</p>
<p>中日之間，既因認識不足，雙方意氣沸騰，原已劍拔弩張；外更受英美挑撥，遂爆發於一旦。惟其因爲認識不足而誤起　衅，終將覺悟非計謀所以消釋之道。迺至二十七年十二月二十二日，日本近衛前首相聲明，以善鄰友好，共同防共與經濟提携爲調整中日邦交根本方針。繼之汪先生發表艷電，饗應近衛首相聲明，而倡導和平運動。共言有曰：「以此（近衛聲明中三點）爲根據，與日本政府交換誠意，以期恢復和平，並以此爲和平之談判，則交涉之途徑已開，中國抗戰之目的，在求國家之生存獨立，抗戰年餘，創痛鉅深，倘能以合於此義之和平，而結束戰爭，國家之生存獨立可保，即抗戰之目的已達。」並對善隣友好一點，加以闡明曰：「日本鄭重聲明對於中國無領土之要求，無賠償軍費之要求，日本不但尊重中國之主權，且將仿明治維新前例，以允許內地居住營業之自由爲條件，交還租界，廢除治外法權，俾中國能完全其獨立。日本政府既有此鄭重聲明，則吾人依於和平方法，不但北方各省，可以保全，即抗戰以來，淪陷各地，亦可收復，而主權及行政之獨立完整，亦得以保持。」我們在今日視之，在先生和平運動政策，更見其正確而適時。尤其日本對華政策一再趨向於兩國互利之基調，漸次實踐無領土要求與尊重中國主權之諾言。於「交還租界及廢除治外法權，俾中國完全其獨立」。一點，今天的事實，已充分證明絕非徒託空言。較之英美於被驅逐以後，已無立足餘地的租界，施惠於重慶政權，大言不慚，卑鄙欺騙者，誠不可同日而語。</p>
<p>中日事變既因誤會而起，迨雙方覺悟非計，各以誠意消除誤會，促成和好。論理則應順利的重復舊觀，爲什麽於今六年了，還得不到澈底的解決，使國家不能專一致力於復興大業，人民不能安居樂業而受生活壓迫之痛苦。我們願於今日深自反省，並申所見，盼望於兩國常局，以期從速貫澈和運之全面實現，增强完遂大東亞戰爭之力量，而我中國亦能及早整備國家復興之建設事業，並共同確立東亞新秩序之基業。</p>
<p>第一，國民政府和平運動政策，爲國家前途，爲人民生計，固極爲準確，而不辭艱險，排除萬難，締造以至於今日的成就，其間經過艱苦的奮國，自爲我們所認識與欽佩。但三年餘之努力，國土之內，殘留割據之局，全而和平尙未實現；物價高漲，人民生活不能安定，政治經濟之體制，雖漸决確立，並趨向於戰時强化目標，而實施之成效，不僅無預期之利，且常有意外之弊，我們應不必諱言，檢討其得失所在，硏究其弊病癥結，如弊在人事，則應不徇私情，撤換調整；如弊在機構，則應裁撤駢枝，合理改組；總之，任何一面，發覺弊病，速籌應付對策。這是盼望我政府當局深自反省的一點。</p>
<p>第二，和平區內人民，在事變之初，受戰爭砲火之苦，近年則受物價高漲生活壓迫之苦，心理上之創痕，未能立時消釋，也是情理之常，不過我們要進一步瞭解自身的責任，與重視自身的力量，復興國家是大家的責任，也惟有集合大象的力量，才可以復興國家。我們對於政府決定的政策，必須積極的竭誠的擁護；同時，對於政府執行政策，也必須積極的嚴肅的督促。我們不可採取消極的不理會的態度；必須採取積極的督促的態度。發揮人民大家的力量，使政府跟着人民的意思以進，安定生活與復與國家，才有希望。這是期待全體同胞深自反省的一點。</p>
<p>第三，友邦日本以强化國府地位，促進中日邦交的眞正親善爲目的，轉變新政策，逐漸具體實現。這當然是十分合理的方針，事實上已經收到相當的效果。但是，我們認爲强化中國人民的力量和地位，注意中國人民的需要和要求，同樣的佔着重要性，這是友邦日本尙未完全做到的。我們可以說，中日之間，今天還未能全面和平，上面所說的是主要因素之一。日本的對華政策；是高而遠的，而中國人民更需要近而切實的政策。這是貢獻於友邦日本的一點。</p>
<p>最後，竭誠盼望兩國當局對於中日合作有益的工作，努力以赴；反之，無益有害的就應絕對避免。以期從速實現中日全面和平，集中日整個力量，完成大東亞戰爭！</p>

<h3 id="c2">蘆溝橋事變六週年　汪主席發表感想 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　汪主席爲蘆溝橋事變六週年發表感想如左：</p>
<p>自從蘆溝橋事變至今，已第六週年，常事變勃發之初，如果我們能隱忍自重，即使不能使事變不致勃發，至少也可使事變不致擴大。如此再過兩年，歐戰已起，形勢一變，中日關係，可以不須訴之戰爭，而得到調整，即使當時不得已而至於擴大，重慶方面，若能於近衛聲明之際，立即響應，中止戰爭，另行開闢和平大路，，中歐戰發生時，中日兩國已經可以同心應付，不但大東亞戰爭不致暴發，世界戰爭亦不致如此蔓延。即使並此不能，而當大東亞戰爭暴發之際，重慶方面，若能立即覺悟到東亞團結之必要，與日本一致，驅逐英美勢力於東亞之外，則大東亞戰爭後，一無內顧之憂，其成功必較容易而迅速。乃重慶方面，一誤再誤三誤，直至今日，還要一直誤下去，甘心做英美的別働隊，使中國直至今日，還沒有得到和平統一，使東亞直到今日，還有些東亞叛逆，作後顧之憂，這種自誤，誤中國、誤束亞，想起來，實在痛恨。國民政府現在只有竭其心力，團結民衆、在和平區內，樹立起中國復興的基礎，整備起中日合作復興東亞的模範，保障治安，增加生產，以協力於大東亞戰爭，求戰爭目的之完遂，一切新國民運動，以及經濟建設，淸鄉事業，均當集中注意力於此。同時我們分析渝方甘心做英美的別働隊，向東亞同胞反噬的，究屬少數，徒以這少數人，挾持着軍事勢力，大多數受其脅制，無從表現自由意志，而且這少數人，除了挾持軍事勢力之外，還利用英美勢力，作其羽翼，利用共匪勢力，作其爪牙更使大多數民衆，痛心疾首，淪於無吿，想到這裏，我們應該以解救重慶方面大多數被壓迫民衆自任，對於這些少數喪心病狂，甘爲東亞叛逆的分子，應該聲罪致討，打被其所挾持的軍事勢力，斷絕其所勾結的勢力，這樣，重慶方面大多數被壓迫的民衆，才能解除桎桔，一致興起、將這些叛逆分子，澈底推翻，以掃除復興中華保衛東亞之障碍，我們愛中國，救中國，愛東亞，救束亞，都應該併力於此。這是我們紀念第六週年蘆溝橋事變時所有的感想及應有的使命。</p>

<p>東京六日中央社電　所羅門方面之日阡·海軍航空部隊於緊密協力下，自六月三十日以來，即逐日對敵軍上陸地點之倫特巴港加以猛襲，使遭重大損失，復於四日猛襲該港，予以重創，是日十二時，日戰鬥機，轟炸機聯合大編隊，到達倫特巴港上空時，即與在該港上空哨戒中之敵戰鬥機展開猛烈空戰，敵防空砲火亦猛烈射擊，頓呈混戰狀態，日機先後擊落敵戰鬥機二十三架，敵勢大挫，日轟炸機隊即乘機投彈，轟炸港內之三千噸級運輸船八艘，軍艦一艘，多數舟艇及上陸地點堆積之軍需品，旋即炸沉舟艇十數艘，運輸船五艘，並將軍需堆積塲炸毀。該港遭日機轟炸後發生大火，已被黑烟籠罩，是役日機僅自炸九架，計是日之戰果實將超過所發表者甚多，敵自六月三十日至七月四日數次被襲，損失重大，實無法補充，故敵方之焦躁已無從掩飾。</p>

<p>新京六日中央社電　本月七日爲蘆溝橋事變六週年，滿洲國國務總理張景惠氏，特發表談話如次：</p>
<p>滿洲建國爲日本肇國以來建設世界政治理想表現之一端，蘆溝橋事變及大束亞戰爭，甚至此次世界大戰，亦可謂爲發動於滿洲之建國，尤其蘆溝橋事變之意義，自前年大東亞戰爭勃發以來，益復洞若觀火，日本多年之理想，亦於大東亞戰爭之勝利而節節實現，誠不勝慶辛。况因日本對華政策之韓變，中日滿三國總力合作之精神，日益堅强，更令人欣幸不已，友邦中華民國於汪主席領導下中國民衆，自大東亞戰爭以來，益協力於大東亞之建設，內修國政，外敦邦交，國運日興，洵爲其前途欣賀，惟冥頑不靈之重慶，其抗日目的早已消失，而猶苟延殘喘，偏居一方，以盡其跳梁之能，實徒作英美之傀儡而已，今逢蘆溝橋事變六週年之際，吾軍亞十億民衆應念及將英美於東亞百餘年來之毒禍，一鼓蕩盡者，擊非日本，益克有此，故吾東亞民衆，尤其中日滿三國，切勿失此良機，努力奮發，建設東亞。</p>

<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電　據蘇聯情報局昨晚發表之特別公報，德軍昨在中部向蘇軍陣綫三路進攻，東綫百百來之沉，至此乃告打破，強大之德軍可以坦克車與空軍爲輔，曾在奧萊爾，庫斯克及貝爾格勒同時進攻，奧萊爾爲德軍在中部前綫主要根據地之一，位於莫斯科西南二百哩許，在戰爭初期即爲德軍所佔領。庫斯克在卡科夫以北一三〇哩，爲去年德軍攻勢最北之終點，該城於今春被蘇軍奪同貝爾格勒在卡科夫之北五十哩，位於庫斯克鐵路綫上，係在冬季攻勢中被蘇軍收復，但今春又被德軍所佔領，該地接近前綫，故在戰事沉寂期問，其附近一帶仍不斷有零星戰事發生。路透軍事訪員認爲，德軍此次進攻之目的，係在着蘇聯攻勢計劉之先鞭，或竟使其不克實現。目前德方對於上述三路進攻消息，雖尚未證實，但昨晚柏林傳出之消息則謂，東綫各段軍事活動均見加緊，尤以維里基魯基與貝爾格勒兩區爲最甚。</p>
<p>中部激戰</p>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電　東綫中部維里基魯基南方一帶之攻防戰，已達極度激烈之勢，蘇軍四日以强力大軍開始向德軍陣地側面進攻，並出動大部戰車飛機助戰，已與邀擊之德軍展開鑒戰。據德眾前綫消息，經長時問之決鬥後，蘇軍已悉被擊退，五日蘇軍再度進犯維里基魯基北方，霍爾姆地區之德軍亦閉始猛攻，似已於某地攻入蘇軍陣地，因此使維里基魯爾基南方地區蘇軍之攻勢，頗受牽制。</p>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電　東綫南部德軍，五日晨突於奧萊爾經庫斯克至貝爾格勒之二百七十公里全綫開始攻勢，以有力空軍作掩護　强大戰車集團爲前鋒，勢如怒濤，猛攻蘇軍重要陣地，規模之大，爲冬季戰後之初見，蘇軍現正愴惶動員預備兵力，拚死防禦，各處遂展開劇烈戰鬥，因德軍勢大，故蘇軍陣地已有數處被德軍突入。蘇聯情報局五日夜之特別公報，亦承認此事，此次作戰是否即德軍夏季攻勢之開始，須待以後情形方可斷言，但徵諸蘇方報吿稱，此次作戰爲「以優勢兵力實行大規模進攻」之言，則此次作戰或即夏季攻勢之前奏也。</p>

<p>南京六日中央社電　國民政府最高經濟顧問石渡莊太耶氏，頃以「新中國之現狀與將來」爲題，撰文紀念七七事變。茲錄其大意如次：『中國參戰之主要目的，爲擊滅英美，而與日本協力，自不待言日本方面自中國參戰以來，即謀實行撤鎖治外法權，交還租界，並期待中國，促共自己之意志，發揮總經濟力，同時中國方而，亦極感謝日本之厚意，擬本此意旨，整理經濟。茲就中國經濟之現狀書，因渝方殘餘勢力，猶尚存在，同時因過去各種關係，故在實行經濟施策時，感覺相當困難，迨至實施緩和物資移動限制，及設立全國商業統制總會，並以上海財界巨頭唐　民爲理事長後，即進行一切準備，展開活動，蓋戰時經濟之重點，乃在供給戰爭所必要之物資與安定民生，中國經濟於此種意義下，亦　儘可能供給爲完成大東亞戰爭所必要之物資而努力，安定中國民生。自各方而情勢而顴，戰爭經濟之依存，自給自足之體勞，乃不得已之趨勢，山此而觀，以上海爲中心之中國經濟，不免將發生一大變化，即中國經濟轉向自給自足經濟後，農村產物及礦產物等，自將努力增產，抑今後中國經濟之一要點即在於各部面之全而增產。國民政府最近樹立三年建設計劃誠可謂爲得當之施策，該計劃以增產爲中心，其必要乃屬常然，增產物資對中國民生之安定與大東亞戰爭，均有極大貢獻，至第一問題，即爲節的消費與厲行儲蓄，蓋無論如何增產，至國民消費亦隨之增加，則供給戰爭之物資，仍將减小，同時民生亦不得安定，故今日全中國實行節的消費，獎勵儲蓄，可謂爲必然之施策，此與增產政策同爲戰時經濟之兩翼，關於儲蓄之獎勵，國民政府及中日兩國銀行，均採同一步驟，積極進行，促進工作之種種措置，莫不得其機宜。關於物價問題自應由物資方面抑制物價之昻騰，同時應努力增加儲蓄，以期减少通貨之一學兩得辦法，中央儲備銀行計劃發行糧食庫券，現已開始發行，自八月一日起，售賣有獎勵蓄債券，更發行福行獎券此亦爲减少通貨之一手段，預料購買者極踴躍。次言解決囤積問題，則囤積問題亦爲戰時經濟上之重要問題，囤積戰時必需物資及民需物資，圖謀暴利之行爲，應絕對禁止，在戰時經濟上自更更有防止之必要。國府組織物資調查委員會由上海市長　公博氏任會長，中國經濟過去以自由主義爲基礎，們認囤積爲日常商業行爲當然發生之事，然在戰時經濟則不然，現中日兩國爲擊滅英美立於同一戰綫，此時應絕對撲滅此種僅依個人自由意思而所起之囤積，僅此事爲僅求私利而輕視國家利益之行爲，故甚盼中日兩國共同努力，以消滅此種行爲，再就研究增產工作而言，實爲必要，蓋中國地大物博，案有定評，若再研究經濟上之增產，工作當更可有顯著進步與改善，此並非謂中國研究不佳，但今日中國於近代研究方面，尚有無勞考究之餘地，例如日本之農產物，中國收獲甚多，可知中國農產物之增產，仍有進步之餘地，因中日兩國經濟提挑，中國農工業各稱經濟部面，均可積極增產，前途極可樂觀，今後中國經濟上，固尚有不少難題，然於地大物博之中國，如努力實行增產，則將來必可收獲莫大成果，吾人亦如此希望而期待。增產問題乃中國經濟政策之根本，相信此問題若能順利解決，則通貨物價等問題，亦可自然解決。總之，今日之中國民心，一因國府之施策適當，二因日本之眞誠原意，故益趨向國府，國府之政治力乃日益增加，此　渝方軍隊歸順之日多，即可明瞭。如此國民政府政治力之日益增大，則確信其各項經濟施策之推進，當必能有極大效果。』</p>

<p>本月六日行政院會議通過，設立上海特別市政府宣傳處，並簡派梁秀予氏爲該處處長，聞梁處長已於昨（六）日抵滬，該處籌備經已就緒，尅日開始辦公，中央社記者特往市府宣傳處訪問，當荷接見，並承發表談話如下：</p>
<p>談話</p>
<p>宣傳爲現代國家重要　政之一，　都以來，中央有宣傳部之　置，各省市亦有宣傳處之組織，上海市宣傳行政，屬市區範圍者，向由市政府秘書處　五科辦理，屬租界內者，有宣傳部直轄各專屬機關，大東亞戰爭發生後，宣傳部設駐滬辦事處於租界，指揮所屬機關，並與市政府聯絡辦理地方宣傳，又自淸鄉工作開始，淸鄉分會有宣傅室之設置，及至最近，以收囘上海租界爲機構，　市政府範圍之擴大，宣傳部門，亦有調整加强之必要，上海市政府特依據各省市宣傳處組織規程，設置本處，宣傳部方面則將駐滬辦事處撤消，以一事權，又淸鄉分會改組後，宣傳室亦歸裁併，所有工作人員，由本處錄用，此爲木處成立之梗概。至本處今後工作重點，約有四端。</p>
<p>其一　上述本市之中央及地方宣傳機關，前此辦理成效，已甚顯著。於本市宣傳事業，深植基礎，水處決於職權範圍內，悉力承接，務使原來工作進行，不致中斷。</p>
<p>其二　現代都市之建設，首在政府與人民意志之合一，本市行政範圍，旣臻擴大，來日一切市政措施，常視前繁重，有隨時傳達於市民之必要，本處當秉承市政府意旨，對施政方針，儘量傳佈於全體市民，同時博採市民之意見，以爲政府施政之參考。</p>
<p>其二　和平又共建國。爲還都以來不動之國策，自中央以至地方，一切宣傳行事，無不以此爲根據，努力闡揚，本市以有租界少存在。向爲渝方反　宣傳所憑藉，大束亞戰爭起後。始漸肅淸，茲因租界收囘，各稱宣傳行政，將　前便利，木處今後當講求各種必要之措施，期使全市數百萬市民，莫不浸潤和平反共建國之意識，貨獻其力量於興華保亞之偉大工作</p>
<p>其四　宣傳工作與文化運動，本屬息息相關自　府公布戰時文化宣傳政策基本綱要。益見兩者之方針趨於一致，上海向爲全國文化之中心，同時亦爲英美散佈殖民地文化之基地。其思想麻醉之結果。使一切崇拜英美及享樂頽廢自由放縱之風習，充塞市內。如何加以洗滌掃除。使本市文化運動基於國家目的及戰時需要。循正當規道以遂其發展。並以此誘導市民文化生活之向上。及自肅精神之振興。亦爲本處今後之課題。自當秉承中央旣定之政策。與本市各文化宣傳機關團體共同努力，以期貫澈。以上四點，爲本處今後工作之基幹，至於具體項目，當隨時斟酌情形，厘定步驟。督率屬員，從事實施，惟本人才識疏淺，負此重貴，深虞力有未逮至望中央及友邦在滬之宣傳報道機關，及本市文化新聞界之先進人士，不斷予以協力，俾得達成其使命」。</p>

<h3 id="c28">統一推進慈善事業的感想　上海市貧病救協會開蘭亭林康侯袁履登　（二）關於推進的困難 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>慈善事業是一種社會事業，慈善事業的推進與發展，全靠辦理慈善事業實犧牲服務的精神，和社食上熱心人士之自動的支持，互相動勉，五相輔　，共襄其成。因此，其成功與失敗，大部份　　精神的感召，不是奪常法律命令所可收效的，現在我們要統一推進慈善事業，也因此存在　相當嚴重的困難。</p>
<p>首先，從國人生活思想習慣上說，視不受　制爲光榮，以各自爲政爲常然，過去習於散沒，最怕規約。而辦理慈善事業者。本無功利可圖，且須任勞任怨，所以努力不懈者，在求其精神上之慰安而已。若驟行嚴格的「統一推進」，至少在施行初期，可能遭遇若干不必要的疑忌與念工。則統一推進之功效未見，而慈善事業先蒙不良影響，甚至一部份人，以不明眞相，由猜疑而傳訛，以爲政府將統制慈善事業，則今後事業所受影響尤大。</p>
<p>其次，從組織方而　，目前滬市三百三十餘慈善團體及其事業，雖有一部份由官方協力而進行者，但居極少數，最大部份，爲宗敎團體創辦，其次爲各民衆團體及私人友好所經營，大體上雖然都很期待政府當局的協助，而其事業之目標與內容，或有宗教上之固定方針與範圍，或有歷史上之特徵與功績，或爲其辦理者竭舉生心血消涓滴滴以成者，在經營者雖無以慈善事業爲私產之心理，但若驟以「統一推進」之理由而欲擴大之，縮小之，或改變之，則實際上不免予以刺激，而事實上或亦未易　效。</p>
<p>再次，在人事方面，就事實而論鳥各旣成慈善　體除少數例外，都有相當悠久的歷史。辦有相當成績，其事業規模雖有鉅細之別，但均已在長時期間義成若干專門人材。以慈善濟人敎人爲學生事業，在精神上。抱「我不入地獄誰入地獄」之心理，不顧其過去之享受與身份，親來不相識的孤苦老幼以至貧病殘廢者如自已的父母子女而侍奉之敎養之，在技術上，成則向外募捐，或則管理，看護，診治，教育，都有專長，實際已視各該團體爲其家庭。此種人　，決非魯　學校所能培養而成，亦絕不能驟然以「統一推通」的需要而改變其環境。同時，全持統一推進工作者如無與這些人材具有同樣犧牲服務的精神與長可辦理善慈　的經騐，熟悉其中艱苦，也就不易舉統一推進之功。</p>
<p>此外，在募捐方面，過去任不統一時期，除特發事件如擊北賑災。係臨時發動，由各方響應以收良好成效外，實際上各慈善團體。都有其特定的勸募範圍，勸募對象，或憑主持者個人之信譽與私人感情關係，或憑宗敎派系，對建關係（如同鄉，同族），憑各該慈勞團體各別的成績，以博取社會之同情，得經常的與臨時的捐助，義以支持其事業，此　募款方式陳舊，成效不大，亟待改善，自無疑問，但若一旦實行「統一推進」，而無確實保陳，則原意雖謀改　與推進其　變，而結果則反使失去自方求存之根據，所求助之者反足以　之。這更是言「統一推進」者所應予注意的。（未完）</p>

<p>據上月二十九日海通社柏林電訊，德經濟部長芬克氏在柏林慷蓄銀行成立一二五週年紀念會上宜稱：「政府對紙幣之國積已嚴行取締，所有非必要之動產與不動產之購買亦同。……；當局對中等階級之人民當加意保議，戰爭時期貨幣仍爲社會個人財富之標準，故政府對貨幣政策梅爲審愼。……政府嘗一再勸吿人氏，勿因非必要之用途而將貨幣自市塲收囘。……至於囤積鈔票亦爲戰時所忌，當局亦常以重稅取締之。……蓄存款大部份係中產階級血汗所得積聚而成。中產階級爲一國之骨幹，政府對於彼等自當爲之覓取安全之保障，給予積極之援助。」</p>
<p>吾人讀了這個消息，不禁發生一種奇異的感想，就是目前德國政府所欲取締的爲囤積貨幣，而中國政府所欲取締的却爲囤積貨物。德人戰時囤幣，故物價平穩，民生安定。國人戰時囤貨，故物價騰踊，民生塗炭。囘憶當第一次世界大戰時，德人亦嘗囤貨，而國人亦嘗囤幣，今則情形適得其反，這是值得研究的。</p>
<p>幣值穩定或日高則囤幣，貨值穩定或日高則囤貨，此爲人類自利自衛的自然法則；世人設欲反其道而行之，則必勞而無功。那末，如何能使幣值穩定而日高？此則須從增加貨物生產與緊縮通貨發行兩方面雙管齊下，方能收效。</p>

<p>對上海特別市政的參政問題，這是建設新上海的重要問題。據一般的觀測，國府方面公佈新特別市組織法後，市民有參政可能，國府及市府當局，關於參政組織，目前的任務，應如何檢討、尤以經潛界如何使其對市政有所貢獻，必須加以充分考慮，其中，上海市商會的今後强化與新市政的關係，更值得注目，商統會成立以後，主要商品同業公會，一律歸該會管轄指導，於是，市商會所負的任務，比從前更爲狹小，除由其中堅指導者提倡市民消費合作社以外，殆無值得注目之活動。不過現在政治情勢將有轉變，市政不久可以一元化，就上海的重要性而言，成立市民參政組織，實有必要。人民團體中最有力的，要推市商會，所以市商會在市政尤其是各項經濟政策上所占的地位，是怎樣的重要，可想而知。商統會是行政院直屬的統制機關而市商會亦爲市府所屬的唯一經濟自治團體，是以有同樣重視之必要。當然，市政府與市商會的協力體制，已逐漸趨於組織化，現今在市經濟局主持之下，有上海市物價評議委員會，在市商會所屬的各同業公會，亦設有評價委員會，然而最近物價在漲，這種組織，差不多並不能發生其效用。將來新市政府的組微必須加以改進。不僅要集中全力於行政組織的調整，同時還要注重市商會各同業公會及其他人民團體的調整與强化。（未完）（雲鸝：繵聯大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c52">幽默與機智 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>「幽默」與「機智」粗看起來是同屬於處世藝術的高超地位而不容易分別它們，「幽默」能融合情感，「機智」亦能，機智能「化險爲夷」，「幽默」最大的效能也是這一點。</p>
<p>不過我們如果能細細回味咀嚼的話，它們最大的分別可以說「機智」是「理智」的，而「幽默」是情惑的，「機智」是才智的巧運，而「幽默」是天性的流露，「機智」是出自心靈上自覺性的機巧，而「幽默」是出自人性的深處。有時候機智是沒有聲色，不動情感，帶有嚴肅性的，而「幽默」是內心眞情的表現，有同情，有憐憫，有愛，有淚，是全人格的表演。</p>
<p>說得再進一步「機智」是「做作」而想博得榮耀，征服旁人的妒忌，使自已的才能在「胸有成竹」的，適當完美的環境中發揮無餘，「應付」得當，事半功倍……這些到全是事業上想成功的要素。至於「幽默」能使人世界的圈外，靜觀人生，誰需勇愛，就給出一點愛，誰需要同情，就給出一點同情，誰要「鼓勵」。　「力量」也都能了解。「幽默」唯一的目的便是要解除人問的「苦悶」和「憂愁」……這些到全是對於人情世故上得到安慰的要素。</p>
<p>於是我們便可看出來「幽默」與「機留」對於人生是同樣重要的，一個人既需要「理智」又需要「情感」。要想在事業成功。又想在人情上得到安慰。那麼我們豈可缺少任何一種呢？</p>

<p>「阿坤嗎？不是這個上春病得幾乎死去的這個阿坤？運氣太壞了！病了不算，又遭人禍，咳！這種事情，我都明白，我很想憑我這條老命，替大家說幾句話，可是，我的兒子，總是勸我。年已老了，不要管閒事，我實在脹得肚子要破了！」黃老伯起先慢慢地說着，後來推開被頭，索性披了衣服坐起來，情緒也緊張了！</p>
<p>「司令部不司令部，老爺不老爺，都是一班亡命之徒，平常就遊手好閒的不務正業之流，這樣橫不行法。總有一天，有人替他們算帳的，看着吧！」黃老伯接着說了些憤慨話</p>
<p>你們打算要多少錢，雖說是借給阿坤的，可是事實上是給這班混蛋化的，眞不値得。不過，話又說囘來，不這樣阿坤沒法出來呀！不要緊的，田單不夠抵押，我可以通融的。你們想要多少？」黃老伯又接着說了這些話，一邊在枕頭下的布袋裏取出鑰匙，走下床來。</p>
<p>「大槪七八百元最少了。我們也預備去頂一頂，如果一定要多要少，我們也準備挨耳光的。」李鎭長囘答黃老伯，黃老伯拖着鞋，到另一間屋子，去了一刻囘來、手裏握着一捲鈔票，交給李鎭長說：</p>
<p>「這裏是八百元，你拿去。總是要用的，你們趕快去！」李鎭長接着鈔票，往口袋裏塞進，一邊點點頭說道：</p>
<p>「謝謝老伯！我們就去辨。」</p>
<p>李陸兩人辭出了黃家，急忽忽的囘到鎭上的××司令部。這時候司令部裏，一邊正興高彩烈的在打牌，一邊嘻嘻哈哈的說笑話，另一個屋角裏，反綁着的阿坤，垂着頭聽憑發落，門口勤務兵瞥見李鎭長來了，連忙招呼着，讓進最後一間的×司今室。</p>
<p>「怎麼啦！槍械有沒有交出？這件事太大了，不能隨便了事的，你們要曉得責任重大啊！」×司令　　官臉，一本正經的說：</p>
<p>「司令！請你照應照應。阿坤是一個良善的種田人。從來不和閑雜人來往的。我們是近鄰，對於他的爲人，很淸楚的。我們敢担保他，決不會窩藏槍械，更不會通匪的。不過，既然司令說他有通匪藏槍的事。總是有人報告的，也許報告的人，同阿坤有什麼過不去？所以請司令明察秋毫，饒恕他一次吧！」李鎭長說到這裏，×司令抬起頭來，把眼睛睜得似銅鈴般的向李鎭長瞪着，陸甲長看形勢不對，連忙挿嘴說：</p>
<p>「剛才驚動弟兄們一番。我們也準備犒賞犒賞的！」</p>
<p>「什麼話！」×司令捏緊拳頭，重重地拍着桌子，兩顆眼珠更加睜得大了，一手指着李鎭長說：</p>
<p>「你做鎭長的、要負責交出，倒想包庇他通匪嗎？我們隊部接到確實情報，那裏會寃枉人家，限你們今天晚上交出槍械。不然連你們也扣留在這裏！」×司令聲色俱厲的咆哮着。李鎭長原來心裏有點不直，所以說了一番衝撞話，不料僵持了。他想如果再衝撞下去，一定要吃眼前虧的，可是心裏總是不平低着頭不作聲。（五）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Our Reflection <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Six years ago today, the unfortunate Lugouqiao Incident occurred. Although past grievances are gradually being resolved, the Chongqing communists are still resisting in a corner, and full peace has not yet been achieved. Even within the peace zone, there are those who harbor doubts and remain hesitant, neither approaching nor distancing themselves. As a result, cunning individuals seize the opportunity to profiteer, while those who consider themselves "virtuous" remain silent. This has led to a distorted and turbid social atmosphere, and the nation's construction is suffering serious setbacks. Looking back at the past and considering the present, one cannot help but feel deeply moved.</p>
<p>We trace the origins of the incident to two main points: Firstly, the lack of mutual understanding between the governments and people of both countries at the time, which led to national policies that were off by a hair's breadth but resulted in a great divergence. Each side went to extremes, causing the unfortunate incident. Secondly, the conspiracies of British and American imperialism, and the incitement of the Communist International, exhausted every means of provocation and discord, causing war between China and Japan in order to reap the benefits.</p>
<p>Because there was insufficient understanding between China and Japan, the emotions of both sides were inflamed, and tensions were already high. Further provoked by Britain and the United States, conflict erupted suddenly. However, because the conflict arose from misunderstandings, both sides will eventually realize that schemes are not the way to resolve it. Consequently, on December 22, 1937, former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement outlining the fundamental principles for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, namely, good neighborliness and friendship, joint anti-communism, and economic cooperation. Subsequently, Mr. Wang (Jingwei) issued a telegram echoing Prime Minister Konoe's statement and advocating for the peace movement. He stated, "Based on these three points (in Konoe's statement), if we exchange sincerity with the Japanese government in order to restore peace, and use this as the basis for peace negotiations, then the path to negotiation will be opened. The purpose of China's resistance war is to seek the survival and independence of the nation. After more than a year of resistance, we have suffered great trauma. If we can end the war with a peace that conforms to this principle, the nation's survival and independence can be guaranteed, and the goal of resistance will have been achieved." He further clarified the point of good neighborliness and friendship, saying, "Japan solemnly declares that it has no territorial demands on China and no demands for war reparations. Japan will not only respect China's sovereignty but will also follow the precedent of the Meiji Restoration by returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights on the condition that it be allowed freedom of residence and business in the interior, so that China can fully achieve its independence. Since the Japanese government has made this solemn declaration, we can, through peaceful means, not only preserve the northern provinces but also recover the lost territories since the start of the resistance war, and maintain the integrity of sovereignty and administrative independence." Looking at this today, Mr. Wang's peace movement policy appears even more correct and timely. In particular, Japan's policy toward China has repeatedly moved toward a foundation of mutual benefit for both countries, gradually fulfilling its promises of no territorial demands and respect for Chinese sovereignty. Regarding the point of "returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, so that China can fully achieve its independence," today's reality has fully proven that this is not merely empty words. Compared to the British and Americans, who have already been driven out and have no foothold in the concessions, offering favors to the Chongqing regime while making arrogant and shameless, base and deceitful statements, they are truly not on the same level.</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese Incident arose from misunderstanding, and both sides have realized that schemes are not the solution, each should eliminate misunderstandings with sincerity and promote reconciliation. Logically, they should smoothly return to the old state of affairs. Why, then, after six years, has a thorough resolution not been achieved, preventing the nation from dedicating itself to the great task of rejuvenation and causing the people to suffer from the pain of an insecure life and economic oppression? We wish to deeply reflect on this today and express our views, hoping that the authorities of both countries will expedite the full realization of the overall peace, strengthen the power to complete the Greater East Asia War, and that China will also be able to prepare for the construction of national rejuvenation and jointly establish the foundation of a new order in East Asia as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Firstly, the National Government's peace movement policy is extremely accurate for the nation's future and the people's livelihood, and it has overcome difficulties and created today's achievements. The arduous struggles it has gone through are recognized and admired by us. However, after more than three years of effort, pockets of resistance still remain within the country, and full peace has not yet been achieved. Prices are soaring, and the people's lives are not stable. Although the political and economic systems are gradually being established and are moving towards the goal of wartime strengthening, the actual results not only lack the anticipated benefits but often have unexpected drawbacks. We should not shy away from frankly examining its successes and failures, and studying the root causes of its problems. If the problem lies in personnel, then replacements and adjustments should be made without regard to personal feelings. If the problem lies in institutions, then redundant branches should be eliminated, and a rational reorganization should be carried out. In short, any problems that are discovered on any side should be addressed with countermeasures as soon as possible. This is one point we hope the government authorities will deeply reflect on.</p>
<p>Secondly, the people in the peace zone suffered from the ravages of war at the beginning of the incident, and in recent years, they have suffered from the high prices and economic oppression. The psychological wounds have not been immediately healed, which is natural. However, we must further understand our own responsibilities and value our own strength. Rejuvenating the nation is everyone's responsibility, and only by gathering the strength of the masses can the nation be rejuvenated. We must actively and sincerely support the policies decided by the government; at the same time, we must also actively and seriously supervise the government's implementation of policies. We must not adopt a passive and indifferent attitude; we must adopt an active and supervisory attitude. By unleashing the power of the people, we can ensure that the government follows the will of the people, and there will be hope for stabilizing lives and rejuvenating the nation. This is one point we expect all compatriots to deeply reflect on.</p>
<p>Thirdly, our friendly neighbor Japan, with the aim of strengthening the National Government's position and promoting genuine amity between China and Japan, is transforming its new policies and gradually realizing them concretely. This is, of course, a very reasonable approach, and in fact, it has already achieved considerable results. However, we believe that strengthening the power and position of the Chinese people, and paying attention to the needs and demands of the Chinese people, are equally important. This is something that our friendly neighbor Japan has not yet fully achieved. We can say that this is one of the main factors why full peace between China and Japan has not yet been achieved today. Japan's policy toward China is lofty and far-reaching, but the Chinese people need policies that are closer and more practical. This is one point we offer to our friendly neighbor Japan.</p>
<p>Finally, we sincerely hope that the authorities of both countries will strive to do work that is beneficial to Sino-Japanese cooperation; conversely, work that is unhelpful or harmful should be absolutely avoided. We hope to expedite the realization of full Sino-Japanese peace, concentrate the entire strength of both countries, and complete the Greater East Asia War!</p>

<h3 id="e2">Chairman Wang's Thoughts on the Sixth Anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, July 7th, Central News Agency: Chairman Wang (Jingwei) issued the following thoughts on the sixth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident:</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident until now, it has been the sixth anniversary. At the very beginning of the incident, if we could have exercised restraint and self-respect, even if we could not have prevented the incident from breaking out, we could at least have prevented it from escalating. If this had been the case, then two years later, when the European war broke out, the situation would have changed, and Sino-Japanese relations could have been adjusted without resorting to war. Even if it was unavoidable at the time to escalate, if the Chongqing side could have immediately responded to the Konoe statement and stopped the war, and opened up a new path to peace, then when the European war broke out, China and Japan could have dealt with it in unison. Not only would the Greater East Asia War not have broken out, but the world war would also not have spread so widely. Even if this was not possible, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, if the Chongqing side could have immediately realized the necessity of East Asian unity and united with Japan to expel British and American forces from East Asia, then there would have been no internal worries after the Greater East Asia War, and its success would have been easier and faster. However, the Chongqing side has made one mistake after another, and continues to make mistakes to this day, willingly acting as a separate unit for Britain and the United States, causing China to not have achieved peace and unity to this day, and causing East Asia to still have some East Asian traitors, causing worries for the future. Thinking about this kind of self-deception, deceiving China, deceiving East Asia, is truly hateful. The National Government now can only exert its utmost efforts to unite the people and establish the foundation for China's rejuvenation within the peace zone, prepare a model for Sino-Japanese cooperation to rejuvenate East Asia, ensure security, and increase production, in order to assist in the Greater East Asia War and seek the completion of the war's objectives. All new national movements, as well as economic construction and rural reconstruction, should focus their attention on this. At the same time, we analyze that the Chongqing side, willingly acting as a separate unit for Britain and the United States, and turning against East Asian compatriots, are ultimately a minority. They are merely using these few people, holding military power, the majority are coerced, unable to express their free will. Moreover, these few people, in addition to holding military power, also use British and American forces as their wings, and use communist bandit forces as their claws, causing the majority of the people to feel deeply grieved and to be helpless. Thinking of this, we should take it upon ourselves to liberate the majority of the oppressed people on the Chongqing side. For these few unscrupulous elements, willingly acting as East Asian traitors, we should condemn their crimes and punish them, defeat the military power they hold, and sever the forces they collude with. Only in this way can the majority of the oppressed people on the Chongqing side be freed from their shackles, rise up in unison, and thoroughly overthrow these traitorous elements, in order to remove the obstacles to rejuvenating China and protecting East Asia. We love China, save China, love East Asia, save East Asia, and should all join forces in this. These are all the thoughts and missions we have when commemorating the sixth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident.</p>

<p>Vichy, July 6th, Central News Agency: According to the Huitong News Agency: General Numata, the Japanese military attache stationed in Vichy, stated in a conversation with reporters yesterday: Since the American military launched its so-called offensive against the Japanese base in the Solomon Islands, up to July 1st, we have sunk six transport ships, four cruisers, and six destroyers, and shot down 77 aircraft. The American plan to eliminate the forward outposts in the Pacific is clearly an event with a very high price. The American offensive in the Pacific may not be a military action but a political action. Roosevelt has the ambition to serve four terms as president, so he is using this to appease the public's demands.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department Abolished <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, July 6th, Central News Agency: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in December of the year before last, the Propaganda Department, in order to promote propaganda work in Shanghai and handle temporary events locally, was approved by the Executive Yuan to establish an office in Shanghai on January 4th of last year. Now, with the return of the Shanghai International Settlement by the friendly nations, in order to strengthen local propaganda work in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Government has specially established a Propaganda Department. In order to unify authority, the Propaganda Department has been approved by the Executive Yuan to abolish the office in Shanghai. The propaganda work within the former jurisdiction of the office in the concessions, except for those directly under the Propaganda Department, will be transferred to the Municipal Government's Propaganda Department. However, since the return of the concessions by the friendly nations to assist us in completing independence and sovereignty is of great significance, and the cultural propaganda in Shanghai has a great relationship with the national cultural propaganda, the former Director of the Shanghai Office, Feng (Yuxiang), who was originally the Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, after relinquishing his position as Director of the Office, was re-appointed by the Executive Yuan's Propaganda Department as a concurrent consultant, in order to assist, guide, and coordinate the promotion of propaganda work in Shanghai in these two capacities.

<p>Taiyuan, July 6th, Central News Agency: Ma Jun, "Lieutenant General Councilor of the First War Zone Command" of Chongqing, in view of the wrongs of the War of Resistance, has defected from the War of Resistance camp this time and arrived in his hometown of Jincheng on the afternoon of the 1st. On the 2nd, he visited the commander of a certain Japanese Army unit and expressed his determination to pledge allegiance to the Peace Movement. Ma Jun, a lieutenant general, is 62 years old and joined the London Branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party when he studied in the United Kingdom. After returning to China, he successively served as a member of the Shanxi Provincial Government, a senior senator of the Beijing Government Senate, a supervisory envoy of Hedong in Shanxi Province, and the heads of the construction, political, and educational departments of Shanxi Province. He is also the most influential person among the co-religionists in Jin Province. He once served as the Vice Chairman of the China Islamic National Salvation Association and is highly respected by Islamic believers. Bai Chongxi trusted the general very much, so the general's participation in the Peace Movement this time has had a great impact on the Chongqing side. At the same time, it will also have a significant impact on the Muslims on the Chongqing side and is attracting much attention from all parties.</p>
<p>Taiyuan, July 6th, Central News Agency: Ma Jun, "Lieutenant General Councilor of the First War Zone Command" of Chongqing, made the following statement at his residence in Jincheng County after joining the Peace Movement: If I had not entered the War of Resistance at the beginning and had always strived for the Peace Movement, then I would have been able to be loyal to the country and filial to my late mother. I have now joined the Peace Movement, and my mother may be able to rest in peace underground. This is the only thing that can bring me some self-satisfaction. The War of Resistance cannot teach the country, but only plunges the people into misery. Now that friendly nations are fulfilling their moral promises, China's rejuvenation can be expected soon. I will henceforth swear to work under the leadership of Chairman Wang (Jingwei) and make glorious efforts to eliminate the Communist Party and rejuvenate the country.</p>

<p>Xinjing, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegraph - This July 7th marks the sixth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident. Zhang Jinghui, Prime Minister of Manchukuo, issued the following statement:</p>
<p>The establishment of Manchukuo is one aspect of Japan's creation of a world political ideal since its founding. The Lugouqiao Incident and the Greater East Asia War, and even the current World War, can be said to have originated from the founding of Manchukuo. In particular, the significance of the Lugouqiao Incident has become even clearer since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War two years ago. Japan's long-held ideals are being realized step by step with the victory of the Greater East Asia War, which is truly cause for celebration. Furthermore, the spirit of cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo has grown stronger due to the change in Japan's policy towards China, which is even more gratifying. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, the people of the Republic of China have been actively cooperating in the construction of Greater East Asia since the Greater East Asia War, improving domestic affairs and fostering diplomatic relations. The nation's fortunes are improving daily, which is cause for celebration for its future. However, the stubborn and unyielding Chongqing has long lost its anti-Japanese purpose and is merely prolonging its existence, clinging to one area to the best of its ability, acting only as a puppet of Britain and the United States. Now, on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident, our Asian compatriots should remember that it was Japan that eliminated the poison of Britain and the United States in East Asia for over a century. The people of East Asia, especially China, Japan, and Manchukuo, must not miss this opportunity, but strive to build East Asia.</p>

<h3 id="e17">German Forces Launch Major Offensive on Eastern Front Southern Sector - Attack Soviet Positions on Three Routes <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegraph - According to a special communiqué released by the Soviet Information Bureau last night, German forces launched a three-pronged attack on Soviet front lines in the central sector yesterday. The stalemate on the eastern front has now been broken. Powerful German forces, supported by tanks and air power, simultaneously attacked in the Orel, Kursk, and Belgorod sectors. Orel is one of the main bases for the German central front line, located approximately 200 miles southwest of Moscow, and was occupied by German forces early in the war. Kursk is located 130 miles north of Kharkov and was the northernmost point of the German offensive last year. The city was seized by Soviet forces this spring. Belgorod is located 50 miles north of Kharkov on the Kursk railway line and was recovered by Soviet forces in the winter offensive, but was occupied by German forces again this spring. The area is close to the front line, so sporadic fighting continued in its vicinity during the period of quiet on the front. Reuters military correspondents believe that the purpose of the German offensive is to preempt the Soviet offensive plans, or even prevent their realization. Although the German side has not yet confirmed the above news of the three-pronged offensive, news from Berlin last night stated that military activity on all sections of the Eastern Front has intensified, especially in the Velikiye Luki and Belgorod areas.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in the Central Sector</p>
<p>Stockholm, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegraph - The offensive and defensive battles in the area south of Velikiye Luki in the central sector of the Eastern Front have reached an extremely intense stage. On the 4th, Soviet forces launched a powerful large-scale attack on the flank of the German positions, and dispatched a large number of tanks and aircraft to assist in the battle, engaging in fierce fighting with the intercepting German forces. According to German front-line news, after a long period of fighting, the Soviet forces were completely repulsed. On the 5th, Soviet forces launched another attack north of Velikiye Luki. German forces in the Kholm region also began a fierce attack, seemingly penetrating Soviet positions in certain areas, thus significantly hindering the Soviet offensive in the southern Velikiye Luki area.</p>
<p>Stockholm, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegraph - On the morning of the 5th, German forces on the southern sector of the Eastern Front suddenly launched an offensive along the entire 270-kilometer line from Orel via Kursk to Belgorod, under the cover of powerful air forces. Powerful tank groups led the vanguard, attacking important Soviet positions like a raging tide. The scale of the offensive is unprecedented since the winter battles. Soviet forces are currently mobilizing reserve forces in a state of panic, defending to the death. Fierce battles have broken out everywhere. Due to the strength of the German forces, Soviet positions have been penetrated in several places. The Soviet Information Bureau's special communiqué on the night of the 5th also acknowledged this. Whether this operation marks the beginning of the German summer offensive remains to be seen. However, considering the Soviet report stating that the operation was a "large-scale offensive with superior forces," this operation may be a prelude to the summer offensive.</p>

<p>Nanjing, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegraph - Mr. Shotaro Ishiwatari, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, recently wrote an article entitled "The Current Situation and Future of New China" to commemorate the July 7th Incident. Here is a summary of its main points: "The main purpose of China's participation in the war is to destroy Britain and the United States and cooperate with Japan, which goes without saying. Since China's participation in the war, Japan has been seeking to implement the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions, and expects China to promote its own will and exert its total economic power. At the same time, the Chinese side is extremely grateful for Japan's kindness and intends to reorganize the economy based on this intention. Regarding the current state of China's economy, due to the remaining forces of Chongqing and various past relationships, considerable difficulties are felt in implementing economic policies. It was not until the implementation of easing restrictions on the movement of materials and the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, with Tang Zhongmin, a Shanghai financial tycoon, as the chairman, that preparations began and activities were launched. The focus of the wartime economy is to supply the materials necessary for the war and to stabilize people's livelihood. In this sense, China's economy is also striving to supply the materials necessary for the completion of the Greater East Asia War as much as possible and to stabilize the livelihood of the Chinese people. Judging from the situation from all sides, the reliance and self-sufficiency of the war economy are inevitable trends. From this perspective, the Chinese economy centered on Shanghai will inevitably undergo a major change. After the Chinese economy turns to a self-sufficient economy, rural products and minerals will strive to increase production. The key point of China's economy in the future lies in the overall increase in production in all departments. The National Government's recent establishment of a three-year construction plan can be said to be an appropriate measure. This plan is centered on increasing production, which is naturally necessary. Increased production of materials will make a great contribution to the stability of the Chinese people's livelihood and the Greater East Asia War. The first issue is thrifty consumption and rigorous savings. No matter how much production increases, if national consumption also increases, the materials supplied for the war will still decrease, and people's livelihood will not be stabilized. Therefore, it is inevitable that China is implementing thrifty consumption and encouraging savings, which are the two wings of the wartime economy, along with increased production policies. Regarding the promotion of savings, the National Government and Chinese and Japanese banks are taking the same steps and actively carrying out work. All kinds of measures to promote work are appropriate. Regarding the price issue, the rise in prices should be curbed by the material aspect, and efforts should be made to increase savings to reduce the amount of currency. The Central Reserve Bank plans to issue food coupons and has begun to issue them. From August 1st, it will sell prize-winning savings bonds and issue Fuxing lottery tickets, which are also a means to reduce currency. It is expected that buyers will be extremely enthusiastic. Next, regarding the solution to the problem of hoarding, the problem of hoarding is also an important issue in the wartime economy. The act of hoarding materials necessary for wartime and materials needed by the people to seek exorbitant profits should be absolutely prohibited, and it is even more necessary to prevent it in the wartime economy. The National Government organized the Materials Investigation Committee, with Shanghai Mayor Su Gongbo as the chairman. In the past, China's economy was based on liberalism, and it was considered natural for hoarding to occur as a daily commercial activity, but this is not the case in the wartime economy. Now that China and Japan are on the same front to destroy Britain and the United States, hoarding based solely on personal freedom should be absolutely eliminated. This is an act that disregards national interests for personal gain, so it is hoped that China and Japan will work together to eliminate this kind of behavior. Furthermore, it is necessary to study and increase production. China is known to be vast and rich in resources. If economic production is further studied, significant progress and improvement can be made. This does not mean that China's research is not good, but China still has room for further research in modern research. For example, Japan's agricultural products are harvested in large quantities in China, which shows that there is still room for progress in increasing China's agricultural production. Since the economies of China and Japan are in harmony, all economic departments in China's agriculture and industry can actively increase production, and the future is very promising. In the future, China's economy still has many difficulties, but if China, which is vast and rich in resources, makes efforts to increase production, great achievements will be made in the future, which we hope and expect. The issue of increasing production is the foundation of China's economic policy. I believe that if this issue can be resolved smoothly, issues such as currency and prices can also be resolved naturally. In short, today's Chinese people's hearts are increasingly inclined towards the National Government because of the appropriate policies of the National Government and the sincerity of Japan. The National Government's political power is increasing day by day, which can be seen from the increasing number of Chongqing troops surrendering. With the increasing political power of the National Government, it is believed that the promotion of its various economic policies will have a great effect."</p>

<h3 id="e22">To Manage Materials and Prices - Thoroughly Rectify Institutions - Unify Authority to Achieve Lasting Results - Deliberation, Control, Investigation, and Corruption Prevention All Considered <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Although the recent surge in prices in this city stems from temporary stimulation, to achieve lasting results and place the material and price issues of this city under unified control, the authorities have thoroughly rectified the implementing agencies to ensure that the authority of control is unified and clear.</p>
<p>Three Major Institutions Working in Parallel</p>
<p>(1) The highest authority for managing materials and control is the Materials Control Deliberation Council. To effectively perform its duties, the council plans to establish an administrative office and set up an office in Shanghai. From now on, it can maintain a close relationship with the work of material control in this city. (2) Under the Materials Control Deliberation Council is the National Commercial Control Association. Although this association is national, its work is centered in Shanghai. In the future, all industry associations and trade associations will be under the unified control of the Commercial Control Association. (3) The Materials Investigation Committee, specially established in the Shanghai area, has begun to operate. The committee is composed of Chinese and Japanese personnel and is equipped with investigators and surveyors to conduct thorough investigations of hoarding of materials. In summary, under the auspices of the three institutions of deliberation, control, and investigation, the price and material issues of this city are expected to maintain a stable situation without the risk of deterioration.</p>
<p>Real Number of Materials Investigators</p>
<p>To ensure the smooth implementation of wartime policies and to completely eliminate hoarding, the National Government decided on the "Organizational Outline of the Materials Investigation Committee" at the Supreme National Defense Conference on May 13th and announced it on the same day. The Japanese side has also expressed great cooperation in this regard. Both the Chinese and Japanese sides have appointed members and held the first committee meeting on June 19th. After the establishment of the committee, it began to work on this day, and Shanghai's economic situation can gradually become normalized. The committee's office address will be located in the racecourse on Maluhou Road. The most urgent task for the committee is to complete the appointment of investigators. It is reported that the quota for investigators has been internally set at three Japanese (two dispatched by the consulate general and one dispatched by the military police), four from the Municipal Council, two from the French Municipal Council, and six from the Municipal Government, for a total of fifteen. A meeting will be held today.</p>

<p>The detention center of the local court in this city holds nearly a thousand inmates, and the climate is becoming increasingly hot, which is detrimental to the health of the inmates. Moreover, the source of prison food is insufficient, and even a grain of rice is difficult to obtain. Therefore, to alleviate the situation of the inmates, the president of the court has strictly ordered the handling judges to consider the case and implement bail for undecided inmates. In addition, starting yesterday, sentenced inmates with longer terms have been transferred to the Zhenjiang and Hangzhou prisons for execution. It is estimated that there are more than one hundred and thirty people in Hangzhou Prison and forty-eight in Zhenjiang Prison.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Municipal Government Propaganda Office Officially Established Yesterday - Director Liang Also Issues Statement <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan meeting on the 6th of this month approved the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Propaganda Office and appointed Mr. Liang Xiuyu as the director of the office. It is reported that Director Liang arrived in Shanghai yesterday (6th), and the preparations for the office have been completed and will begin operations shortly. A Central News Agency reporter visited the Municipal Government Propaganda Office and was granted an audience. Director Liang issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Statement</p>
<p>Propaganda is one of the important policies of modern countries. Since the founding of the capital, the central government has established a propaganda department, and each province and city also has a propaganda office. The Shanghai municipal propaganda administration, within the scope of the urban area, has been handled by the fifth section of the Municipal Government Secretariat. The area within the concessions was under the direct jurisdiction of the various specialized agencies of the Propaganda Department. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Propaganda Department established a Shanghai office in the concession to command its subordinate agencies and coordinate with the Municipal Government to handle local propaganda. In addition, since the start of the rural pacification work, the Pacification Division had a propaganda office. Recently, with the recovery of the Shanghai concessions as the mechanism and the expansion of the scope of the Municipal Government, the propaganda departments also need to be adjusted and strengthened. The Shanghai Municipal Government has specially established this office in accordance with the organizational regulations of the propaganda offices of various provinces and cities. The Propaganda Department will abolish the Shanghai office to unify the authority. After the reorganization of the Pacification Division, the propaganda office will also be merged, and all staff will be employed by this office. This is a summary of the establishment of this office. As for the future work focus of this office, there are about four points.</p>
<p>First, the previous central and local propaganda agencies in this city have achieved significant results. The foundation has been deeply rooted in the propaganda cause of this city. This office will resolutely inherit the work within the scope of its authority to ensure that the original work is not interrupted.</p>
<p>Second, the construction of modern cities lies first in the unity of the will of the government and the people. Now that the administrative scope of this city has been expanded, all municipal measures will become more burdensome in the future, and it is necessary to communicate them to the citizens at any time. This office will follow the instructions of the Municipal Government and disseminate the policies of the government to all citizens as much as possible, and at the same time, widely solicit the opinions of the citizens as a reference for government policies.</p>
<p>Third, peace and common national construction are the unchanging national policies since the return of the capital. From the central government to the local governments, all propaganda events are based on this and strive to promote it. The existence of the concessions in this city has been relied upon by Chongqing for anti-Japanese propaganda. After the start of the Greater East Asia War, it gradually subsided. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the various propaganda administrations will be more convenient than before. This office will formulate all necessary measures in the future to ensure that millions of citizens in the city are imbued with the awareness of peace, anti-communism, and national construction, and contribute their strength to the great cause of revitalizing China and protecting Asia.</p>
<p>Fourth, propaganda work and cultural movements are inherently closely related. Since the government promulgated the basic guidelines for wartime cultural propaganda policies, it has become increasingly clear that the direction of the two is consistent. Shanghai has always been the cultural center of the country and a base for Britain and the United States to spread colonial culture. The result of its ideological anesthesia has been that all the winds of worshiping Britain and the United States and enjoying decadence, freedom, and indulgence have filled the city. How to wash away and eliminate them, so that the cultural movement in this city is based on national goals and wartime needs, and follows the proper regulations to achieve its development, and to guide the improvement of citizens' cultural life and the revitalization of the spirit of self-discipline, is also the subject of this office in the future. We should follow the established policies of the central government and work together with the city's cultural propaganda organizations to implement them. The above four points are the foundation of this office's future work. As for specific projects, we should consider the situation at any time, determine the steps, and supervise the subordinates to implement them. However, I am of shallow talent and knowledge and bear this heavy responsibility. I am deeply worried that I will not be able to reach the hope that the central government and friendly propaganda and reporting agencies in Shanghai, and the advanced people in the city's cultural and journalistic circles, will continue to cooperate to achieve their mission."</p>
<p>Liang's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Here is a brief biography of Liang: He is a native of Guangdong, graduated from National Sun Yat-sen University, and graduated from the Faculty of Law of Meiji University in Japan. After returning to China, he worked at the China Daily as the chief writer, editor-in-chief, and editor of the China Monthly. After the Sixth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, he served as the chief secretary of the Central Propaganda Department until now. Since the return of the capital, he has served as the director of the General Affairs Department of the Propaganda Department, concurrently as the director of the Business Department, the executive director of the China Broadcasting Business Construction Association, the major general training committee member and chief instructor of the Central Army General School Training Corps, the secretary-general of the New National Movement Promotion Committee, and the director of the Management Office of the China Youth Model Corps. Deputy Education Director of the Central Youth Cadre School and other positions.</p>
<p>Japanese Manufacturers Support the Imposition of Scrap Paper Tax</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Scrap Paper Business Transfer Tax Office presented the Financial Bureau to approve the establishment of the paper business tax office, it has been progressing smoothly. Recently, the Municipal Government received a letter from the Japanese Embassy regarding the situation of the tax collection agencies in the concession, so that they could cooperate with each other at any time in order to make progress smoothly. According to rumors from Japanese paper mills, many Japanese manufacturers, in order to comply with the purpose of their embassy and the spirit of Chinese-Japanese cooperation, are doing their best to support the opening of the scrap paper tax, so as to be a model.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Municipal Education Committee Considers Giving Preferential Treatment to Teachers <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Association believes that the future of education is greatly related to the upcoming return of the concessions in this city. Yesterday (6th) at 3:00 p.m., the fifth committee meeting was held in the Municipal Government Conference Hall to discuss future progress. First, Chairman Chen reported: (1) the opinion on reorganizing the Municipal Education Bureau after the recovery of the concessions, (2) the plan on the relief of teachers and staff. Then, the discussion began and the proposals were submitted: (1) Committee Member Wang Yan proposed to stipulate that teachers' children should be exempted from tuition fees when they are admitted to schools. Secretary-General Zhou proposed to hire fundraisers for the Poor Education Fund and to establish a Poor Education Fund Management Committee. (3) Section Chief Chen Dashen proposed to subsidize the living of teachers and staff in this city by appropriating funds from the government. All of the above proposals were approved satisfactorily. The list of members of the Poor Education Fundraiser was also decided immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Thoughts on the Unified Promotion of Charitable Undertakings: Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association, Lan Ting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng (II) Difficulties in Promotion <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Charity is a social undertaking. The promotion and development of charity rely entirely on the spirit of sacrifice and service by those running charitable organizations, and the automatic support of enthusiastic people in society. These groups encourage and complement each other to achieve their shared goals. Therefore, success or failure largely depends on the appeal of this spirit, which cannot be achieved by mere laws and orders. Therefore, there are considerable and serious difficulties in our current desire to unify and promote charitable undertakings.</p>
<p>First, in terms of the thinking and habits of the Chinese people, freedom from control is seen as glorious, and each going their own way is considered normal. In the past, people were accustomed to dispersal and feared regulations most of all. Those running charitable organizations have no personal gain to seek, and must endure hardship and resentment. Their tireless efforts seek only spiritual comfort. If strict "unified promotion" is suddenly implemented, it is likely to encounter some unnecessary doubts and resistance, at least in the initial stages. The benefits of unified promotion may not be seen, while charitable undertakings may suffer adverse effects. Some people, unaware of the truth, may spread rumors based on suspicion, believing that the government will control charitable organizations, which will have an even greater impact on future endeavors.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of organization, of the more than 330 charitable organizations and undertakings in Shanghai, a small number are carried out with the cooperation of the government. Most were founded by religious groups, followed by various civic groups and private friends. While they generally expect assistance from the government, the goals and content of their undertakings may have fixed religious directions and scopes, or historical characteristics and merits, or represent the dedication and hard work of those running them. While operators may not view charitable undertakings as their private property, if they are suddenly enlarged, reduced, or changed in the name of "unified promotion," it will inevitably cause stimulation, and in fact, it may not be easy to achieve results.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of personnel, in fact, most established charitable organizations, with a few exceptions, have a relatively long history and have achieved considerable success. Although their scale varies, they have all developed specialized talent over a long period of time. They regard helping and teaching people as their lifelong career, embracing the spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" Regardless of their past enjoyment and status, they personally serve and nurture unknown, impoverished elderly, and orphaned children, as well as the sick and disabled, as if they were their own parents and children. Technically, they excel in fundraising, management, care, diagnosis, treatment, and education. In practice, they regard these organizations as their families. This kind of personnel cannot be cultivated by ordinary schools, and cannot be easily changed due to the need for "unified promotion." At the same time, those who are in charge of the unified promotion work, if they do not have the same spirit of sacrifice and service as these talents, nor have the experience in managing charitable affairs, and are unfamiliar with the hardships involved, it will not be easy to achieve the benefits of unified promotion.</p>
<p>In addition, in terms of fundraising, in the past, during the non-unified period, except for special events such as disaster relief in North China, which were launched temporarily and received good results through widespread response, in reality, each charitable organization had its specific fundraising scope and target. They relied on the credibility and personal relationships of the organizers, or on religious affiliations, kinship ties (such as people from the same hometown or clan), or on the respective achievements of the charitable organizations, to win social sympathy and obtain regular and temporary donations to support their undertakings. There is no doubt that this old fundraising method is ineffective and urgently needs improvement. However, if "unified promotion" is implemented without solid guarantees, although the original intention is to seek reform and promote development, the result may be the loss of the basis for self-preservation, and those who are sought to help may instead be harmed. This is something that those who advocate "unified promotion" should pay attention to. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e32">The Su Yizhi Case: Final Arguments Concluded Yesterday <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>In the case of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School, who died from being defiled, the court hearing was held yesterday morning. First, the lawyer representing the Public Works Department, Zhang Tianyin, stated: The wine bottle found in the room of Principal Yu Jierong by the police last time was sent to the Public Works Department's Health Department for chemical testing. The results confirmed that the wine contained no poison. Currently, Chief Detective Jiang Yingxiang, who is handling the case, has a report to present and should be questioned. Chief Detective Jiang then reported to the court that the facts were clear. The court ordered the commencement of the defense. First, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, Zhang Tianyin, spoke, stating that according to the coroner’s report, the deceased died from injuries. This is consistent with the testimonies of witnesses. There is no doubt that the defendant should be held criminally liable. He requested the court to impose the maximum penalty according to Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The defendant's lawyer stood up and argued that the testimonies of witness Li Jinghong were inconsistent, and that the elementary school students were not of legal age and were not qualified to testify. He also believed that the coroner's injury report was unlawful and requested a re-examination. The plaintiff's lawyer, Shao Bao San, then presented a supplementary claim for damages totaling 80,000 yuan. The court announced the conclusion of the arguments and scheduled the judgment to be announced at 10:00 am on the 2nd of next month.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Japanese Ambassador Gu Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday: Negotiating the Return of Concessions in Shanghai; Foreign Minister Chu and the French Ambassador Have Both Arrived, and the French Concession Should Be Returned Soon <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China, Gu, arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 2:00 PM, accompanied by two councilors, Ota and Shimizu, and Secretary Terashima. He immediately went to the Broadway Building to rest. During his stay in Shanghai, the ambassador is scheduled to hold important meetings with relevant parties on the return of concessions and other important matters. The Shanghai International Settlement was signed on June 30 by the Chinese and Japanese authorities and will be recovered on August 1. Therefore, the only remaining concessions in China that have not been returned are the Italian Concession in Tianjin and the French Concession in Shanghai. After Italy's National Government entered the war on January 9, and China and Japan signed an agreement to return the concessions and abolish extraterritoriality, Italy returned its concessions in China on January 14. Thanks to the decisive decisions of French leaders Laval, France also declared on the 23rd that it would abolish extraterritoriality in China and give up its concessions. Therefore, it is only a matter of time before the National Government takes over all the concessions. This time, thanks to the signing of an agreement between China and Japan, the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement can be realized quickly. Regarding the recovery of the Italian Concession in Tianjin and the French Concession in Shanghai, the Government has been actively negotiating with the governments of these countries since the beginning of this year, and has achieved great results. Therefore, it is feared that the recovery of the French and Italian concessions may be resolved before August 1. French [omitted name] and French Consul General Majere arrived in Shanghai from North China one day before Ambassador Gu came to Shanghai. Foreign Minister Chu is also scheduled to come to Shanghai in the next day or two. It is reported that the French side hopes to postpone the implementation in order to prepare for related matters. However, the current issue is not simply a matter to be dealt with administratively, but rather requires major political considerations. The French government has always adopted a proactive and cooperative approach to building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and is making every effort to promote its concrete realization. Therefore, it is deeply believed that it will also remove all concerns and quickly coordinate its measures with Japan. It is expected that the negotiations on the recovery of the French and Italian concessions will have concrete progress and achieve a satisfactory settlement in the shortest possible time with the sincere cooperation of the countries concerned.</p>

<p>According to sources, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the International Settlement, which was formed more than a decade ago to counter the power of British and American merchants, and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, which was formed in imitation, are now preparing for a glorious end because the International Settlement has been recovered on August 1 through an agreement signed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and allied Japan, and the recovery of the French Concession is also under discussion. Once the two concessions are recovered, the Taxpayers' Associations will no longer need to exist.</p>

<p>The delivery time for mail to counties and towns along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was previously extended due to transportation delays. Whether express mail, registered mail, or ordinary mail, the shortest time required was half a month. This was because the mail was transported from Shanghai to Hangzhou by train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and then transported by the Zhejiang Postal Administration by boat and vehicle. According to sources, the delivery time for mail to and from that area (Zhuji, Jinhua, Shengxian, Yiwu, Dongyang, etc.) has been shortened compared to the past. Each letter, whether sent from Shanghai to those places or from those places to Shanghai, can now reach its destination in one week. This is mostly due to transportation by train on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which is very convenient for people from eastern Zhejiang living in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Hot Water Store Trade Association has requested the Municipal Health Bureau to find a way to remove the coal slurry left over from daily burning by its members in Nanshi, in order to improve hygiene and facilitate business. In the past, the coal slurry from hot water stores in the meat market was removed by cleaners sent by the Health Bureau. Therefore, each hot water store pays taxes according to the law.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Wife of Artist Cheng Keguang Attempted Suicide Due to Financial Difficulties: Hoping Relatives, Friends, and Authorities Will Provide Relief <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Artist Cheng Keguang was assassinated by Kuomintang agents on March 22, 1940, at 8:30 PM in front of the Jue Lin Vegetarian Restaurant on Xiafei Road, where he was shot eight times and died on the spot. For four years, Cheng left behind his elderly parents, orphans, and a widow, a family of seven, with no one to support them. Struggling in hardship, the entire family's livelihood was in a desperate situation. His wife, Cheng Liu Xiazhen, attempted suicide twice last year in order to die quickly, but was rescued each time. However, requests for help from relatives and friends were often met with cold shoulders. Therefore, on May 23 of this year, she attempted suicide for the third time. Fortunately, she was discovered early and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. She has now recovered and been discharged from the hospital. She has appealed to all parties, requesting relief. She hopes that Cheng's friends and relatives will provide assistance to Cheng's surviving family, and that the government will promptly implement a comprehensive relief and education plan for the families of the martyrs of the Peace Movement, so that the souls of the martyrs can be comforted in the afterlife, and the service spirit of those who die later can be encouraged.</p>
<p>The Circumstances of Cheng Keguang's Martyrdom</p>
<p>Martyr Cheng Keguang was a famous artist who served in the Sino-French Pharmacy and the press during his lifetime. He was young and energetic and highly valued by all parties. In September 1939, on the recommendation of Sun Mingqi, he joined the Peace Movement, taking charge of activities in various Shanghai organizations. Cheng did not avoid danger and worked hard. Due to jealousy from the Kuomintang, on March 22, 1940, at 8:30 PM, he was assassinated by thugs in front of the Jue Lin Vegetarian Restaurant on Xiafei Road, where he was shot eight times, hitting vital parts of his body, and died on the spot without leaving a will. He died with regret at the age of only thirty-five.</p>
<p>His Wife Liu Attempted Suicide</p>
<p>He left behind his elderly parents, orphans, and a widow, a family of seven, who suddenly lost their support. The Central Party Headquarters issued 4,000 yuan for funeral expenses. After the funeral was hastily completed, the Executive Yuan allocated 11,600 yuan in old currency at the end of December of the same year to maintain the family's life. However, due to rising prices and the high cost of living in recent years, Liu, a young widow who did not understand how to produce, owed more and more debts in the past four years. She became disillusioned with the world and attempted suicide twice last year to follow her husband in death. Although she was rescued, she did not know how to live in the long years to come. Therefore, on May 23 of this year, she attempted suicide for the third time in order to die quickly. She was discovered and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment and has now recovered and been discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p>Hoping for Sympathy and Assistance from All Sectors</p>
<p>Cheng's surviving family currently lives at No. 30, Lane 1423, Park Villa, Yuquan Road. His father, Cheng Wenyuan, is 74 years old, his mother, Cheng Zhang, is 52 years old, his wife, Liu Xiazhen, is 32 years old, and they have four children: the eldest is 17 years old, the second is 15 years old, the third daughter is 9 years old, and the youngest son is 6 years old. The eldest two sons are apprentices through referrals, and efforts are being made to enroll the third daughter and youngest son in school. The living conditions of the family of seven are pitiful. Cheng was from Qingbo, and it is hoped that all sectors of Shanghai and Cheng's friends, relatives, and former colleagues will sympathize and provide assistance. It is said that Liu intends to go to Nanjing in the coming days to request relief from the authorities.</p>

<p>One week ago, the coal briquettes in Shanghai's markets suddenly became in short supply, and rumors spread. Now, the relevant authorities are striving to eliminate this situation. The main measures are: (1) To distribute all the coal that should have been distributed in the three months from July to September, effectively increasing the amount of coal stored for three months; (2) To instruct various factories to repair their machines, not only to expedite shipments, but also to resume full operation, turning the existing raw materials into coal briquettes to fully supply the needs; (3) To supply users with less than one ton at any time. In addition to the above effective measures, coal briquette manufacturers also convened a meeting yesterday to discuss supplying as much as possible to various important cases. It is expected that the serious problem of coal briquette supply can be completely resolved in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Germany Bans Hoarding Currency <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>According to a Berlin dispatch from the Haitong News Agency on the 29th of last month, the German Minister of Economic Affairs, Fink, declared at the 125th anniversary celebration of the Berlin Savings Bank: "The government has strictly banned the hoarding of currency, as well as the purchase of all unnecessary movable and immovable property. The authorities should pay attention to protecting the people of the middle class. During wartime, currency is still the standard of social and individual wealth. Therefore, the government is very cautious about monetary policy. The government has repeatedly advised people not to withdraw currency from the market for unnecessary purposes. Hoarding banknotes is also taboo during wartime, and the authorities often impose heavy taxes to suppress it. Savings deposits are mostly accumulated from the hard work of the middle class. The middle class is the backbone of a country, and the government should find security for them and provide active assistance."</p>
<p>After reading this news, we cannot help but have a strange feeling, that is, what the German government wants to ban now is the hoarding of currency, while what the Chinese government wants to ban is the hoarding of goods. Germans hoard currency during wartime, so prices are stable and people's livelihoods are secure. Chinese hoard goods during wartime, so prices soar and people's livelihoods suffer. Recalling that during the First World War, Germans also hoarded goods, and Chinese also hoarded currency, but now the situation is the opposite, which is worth studying.</p>
<p>Currency is stable or rising, so currency is hoarded; goods are stable or rising, so goods are hoarded. This is the natural law of human self-interest and self-defense. If the world wants to go against it, it will be fruitless. So, how can we make the value of currency stable and rising? This requires a two-pronged approach: increasing the production of goods and tightening the issuance of currency.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Authorities Pay Attention to Speculation in the Black Market: Cracking Down on Disguised Handling Fees <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Although the rise in prices is related to the balance of supply and demand, it would not have drastic changes without hoarding, speculation, and monopolies. At a time when the authorities are controlling materials, facilitating sources, and striving to increase production, prices are not leveling off, but skyrocketing. The main reason is currently attributed to speculation and hoarding, especially speculation in the black market, which is of great concern to society. According to recent price increases, the first thing that started the trend was the soaring prices in the black market. In addition to the limited price, the increase in disguised handling fees for gold ornaments sold in jewelry stores in the black market is very high in a single day, and the handling fee for gold ornaments in jewelry stores increases accordingly. Therefore, the increase or decrease in this handling fee in jewelry stores is a semi-public black market transaction, which directly stimulates the rise in prices of all goods and has a great impact. Because it is not a necessary item for the people, it moves from it and restrains the market price of various major commodities, causing a price increase trend, which is necessary to strictly crack down on. The relevant authorities have sent people to fully understand where the problem lies, and will strictly crack down on the disguised handling fees for gold ornaments sold in jewelry stores. If anyone is found to be a repeat offender, they will be punished as a warning.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office has published a notice stating that the fourth phase of edible oil distribution will be from June 28 to July 7, and will first distribute edible oil in Pudong, Puxi, and Nanshi, with each person still limited to four liang. However, the edible oil to be distributed in Zhabei, the International Settlement, and the French Concession has not yet started. Ordinary people need oil very urgently. According to sources, the office is actively expediting the shipment of edible oil to be sold in Zhabei, the International Settlement, and the French Concession. Many merchants have already received the allocated oil. However, before all the merchants in the territory have finished loading the goods, the edible oil must be stored, and the distribution must be carried out consistently at a set time so that residents can purchase edible oil at the same time. Sources also revealed that the edible oil distributed in Shanghai in the fourth phase is still squeezed by military allocation. It is soybean oil and raw oil produced by oil mills in the suburbs of Shanghai. The official distribution date will be before the 10th of this month.</p>

<p>The Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Association Market at No. 15 Edward Road temporarily suspended trading on the 30th of last month due to rising prices of miscellaneous grains and edible oil, in order to prevent speculators from outside the industry from taking advantage of the situation. According to sources, the market is currently undergoing reorganization and will be completed in the coming days. It is said that the reorganized market will be jointly operated by officials and merchants.</p>

<p>Following past practices, the Shanghai silver and money businesses will continue to handle silk and tea loans this year. However, the loan methods have undergone many changes. Previously, they would directly go to the production areas with silk and tea merchants to investigate loans. Now, silk and tea merchants must provide collateral and guarantors in Shanghai, strictly guaranteeing that the loans are used for silk or tea purposes. This is intended to align with the goals of investing in production, revitalizing the rural economy. It is said that the amount of loans issued is much less than before the incident.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Trend of Chinese Stocks <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, single-stock factories opened lower, likely because the constant rise in stock prices was not seen as a good thing by the industry, and a certain major firm with strength sold off a large amount, which was also a major factor. However, due to the firmness of gold prices, most new and old investors did not give up their only opportunity, and actively pushed prices up. Although most stocks fell, they consolidated during midday and then turned stable. The two foreign tobacco companies and the public utilities, such as Northern Water and Electricity, continued to advance upward due to demand exceeding supply. China Electric has shown weakness, while China Match experienced a significant decline. Department stores Wing On and Sun Sun had large fluctuations, ultimately closing lower along with Sincere and China National Products. Underwear knocked through the barriers, while King Sun and King Fook socks also showed weakness. In the textile industry, Wing On Textiles was still fluctuating around a key level, Rong Feng re-entered the key level, Sino-Foreign Yarn Mill's trend was stable, and Great China Weaving rose again. In the cultural industry, World Book showed unique strength, while Commercial Press and China Book both experienced declines. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Sino-French and New Asia continued to decline. Five Continents and Sino-Western's prices remained at the original transaction price. Kang Yuan Canning was still opening at the key level, while Jiu An Industrial and Tong Yi Trust were stable, and International Automobile had active trading, with New Asia Construction showing unusual strength.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: Jewelry stores are still selling gold at the limited price, and the handling fee is the same as the previous day. Off-market prices have risen again due to continued buying from Tianjin, but slightly declined at midday, although still higher than the previous day. The price of sycee silver was slightly lower.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: The cloth market was firm at first but then weakened. The opening price in the morning set a new record, but then many people sold off due to excessive gains, and sentiment turned soft, causing market prices to decline step by step. As a result, Dragon Head Fine Cloth fell back below the key level, lower than the previous day. The Four Gentlemen Poplin also saw a price decline. There were no changes in the spot prices of Peach Blossom Ladies' Lawn Cloth and White Cat Printed Cloth. Qin Mei Ren's original color fine cloth was right at the key level.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn: The cotton yarn market fell slightly, with thin trading volume. 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix and 32-count double-strand Fairy Peach fell significantly, while 10-count Red Double Horse fell only slightly.</p>

<p>The issue of participating in the Shanghai Special Municipality is an important one for building a new Shanghai. According to general observations, after the National Government announces the new Special Municipality Organizational Law, it is possible for citizens to participate in politics. The National Government and the Municipal Government authorities should review how to organize participation in politics, especially how to enable the business community to contribute to municipal administration. The strengthening of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce in relation to the new municipal administration is worth noting. After the establishment of the Commercial Control Conference, the major commodity trade associations were all under the jurisdiction and guidance of the conference. As a result, the tasks of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce became narrower than before. Apart from the promotion of citizen consumer cooperatives by its key leaders, there has been little noteworthy activity. However, the current political situation is about to change, and municipal administration will soon be unified. Given the importance of Shanghai, it is necessary to establish a citizen participation organization. The most powerful of the people's organizations is the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, the importance of the position of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce in municipal administration, especially in various economic policies, is self-evident. The Commercial Control Conference is a control organ directly under the Executive Yuan, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is the only economic self-governing body under the Municipal Government. It is therefore necessary to attach equal importance to both. Of course, the cooperation system between the Municipal Government and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is gradually becoming organized. Currently, under the auspices of the Municipal Economic Bureau, there is the Shanghai Municipal Price Review Committee, and the trade associations under the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also have evaluation committees. However, prices have been rising recently, and this organization is almost unable to exert its effect. The future reorganization of the new Municipal Government must be improved. Not only must we concentrate our efforts on adjusting the administrative organization, but we must also pay attention to the adjustment and strengthening of the trade associations of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and other people's organizations.

<h3 id="e53">Humor and Wit <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>"Humor" and "wit," at first glance, both seem to belong to the high realm of the art of dealing with the world and are not easy to distinguish. "Humor" can integrate emotions, and so can "wit." Wit can "turn danger into safety," and the greatest effect of "humor" is also this point.</p>
<p>However, if we can carefully savor and chew on them, their greatest difference can be said that "wit" is "rational," while "humor" is emotional. "Wit" is the clever operation of intelligence, while "humor" is the outpouring of nature. "Wit" comes from the conscious ingenuity of the mind, while "humor" comes from the depths of human nature. Sometimes wit is without sound or color, without emotion, and has a solemnity, while "humor" is the expression of inner true feelings, with sympathy, pity, love, and tears. It is a performance of the whole personality.</p>
<p>To put it further, "wit" is "artificial" and wants to win glory, conquer the jealousy of others, and make one's own talents play out without restraint in a "prepared" and appropriately perfect environment, "cope" properly, and get twice the result with half the effort... These are all the elements for success in a career. As for "humor," it can make people stand outside the world's circle, observe life calmly, give a little love to whoever needs courage and love, give a little sympathy to whoever needs sympathy, and "encourage" "strength" that everyone can understand. The only purpose of "humor" is to relieve human "boredom" and "sorrow"... These are all elements for obtaining comfort in human affairs.</p>
<p>Thus, we can see that "humor" and "wit" are equally important to life. A person needs both "reason" and "emotion." If you want to succeed in your career and get comfort in human relationships, how can we lack either one?</p>

<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>"Ah Kun? Isn't that Ah Kun who almost died from a spring illness? Too bad luck! Sick already, and then suffered a man-made disaster, alas! I understand these things. I really want to say a few words for everyone with my old life, but my son always advises me that I am old and shouldn't meddle in other people's affairs. I'm really so full of anger that my stomach is about to burst!" Old Man Huang said slowly at first, but then pushed away the quilt and simply sat up wearing his clothes, his emotions also becoming tense!</p>
<p>"Headquarters or no headquarters, master or no master, they are all a bunch of desperate people, usually idle and not engaged in proper business. These people are doing whatever they want without regard for the law. One day, someone will settle accounts with them. Just watch!" Old Man Huang continued with some indignant words.</p>
<p>"How much money do you plan to want? Although it is said to be lent to Ah Kun, it is actually going to be spent by these bastards. It's really not worth it. But, then again, Ah Kun can't get out without it! It doesn't matter. If the fields are not enough for collateral, I can accommodate you. How much do you want?" Old Man Huang then said these words, while taking out the key from the cloth bag under the pillow and getting out of bed.</p>
<p>"At least seven or eight hundred yuan. We are also prepared to top it off. If they must ask for more or less, we are also prepared to be slapped," answered Village Chief Li to Old Man Huang. Old Man Huang dragged his shoes to another room, went for a moment, came back, and handed a roll of banknotes to Village Chief Li, saying:</p>
<p>"Here are eight hundred yuan. Take it. You will need it anyway. You go quickly!" Village Chief Li took the banknotes, stuffed them into his pocket, and nodded, saying:</p>
<p>"Thank you, Old Man! We will go and handle it."</p>
<p>Li and Lu said goodbye to the Huang family and hurried back to the ×× Headquarters in the town. At this time, in the headquarters, some were happily playing cards, while others were laughing and joking. In another corner of the room, Ah Kun, tied up with his hands behind his back, was hanging his head and waiting for his fate. The sentry at the door caught sight of Village Chief Li coming and quickly greeted him, letting him into the last room, Commander ×'s office.</p>
<p>"What's the matter! Have the firearms been handed over? This matter is too big to be taken lightly. You must understand the heavy responsibility!" Commander × said with an official face, very seriously:</p>
<p>"Commander! Please take care of it. Ah Kun is a good farmer who has never associated with idlers. We are close neighbors and are very clear about his character. We dare to guarantee that he will never harbor firearms, let alone collude with bandits. However, since the commander says he has colluded with bandits and hidden guns, someone must have reported it. Perhaps the reporter has some grudges against Ah Kun? So please, Commander, investigate carefully and forgive him once!" When Village Chief Li said this, Commander × raised his head and glared at Village Chief Li with eyes as big as copper bells, and Lu, the head of the Jia, seeing that the situation was not right, quickly interjected, saying:</p>
<p>"We have also prepared a reward for the brothers who were disturbed just now!"</p>
<p>"What are you saying!" Commander × clenched his fist and slammed it heavily on the table, his eyes widening even more, and pointing at Village Chief Li with one finger, he said:</p>
<p>"You are the village chief and you are responsible for handing him over, but you want to cover up his collusion with bandits? Our team received reliable intelligence, so how could we wrongly accuse people? We are giving you until tonight to hand over the firearms. Otherwise, we will detain you here as well!" Commander × roared sternly. Village Chief Li had originally felt a little unfair, so he had said some conflicting words, but he didn't expect it to come to a standstill. He thought that if he continued to conflict, he would definitely suffer an immediate loss, but he still felt uneasy in his heart and lowered his head in silence. (5)</p>

<p>(1) The 29th issue of "Luohan Cai" magazine contains an article by Mr. Nie Yuntai entitled "The Gospel of Lung Disease," which describes the prescription and preparation method of pig pancreas wine for the treatment of lung disease, which is transcribed below for reference by lung disease patients:</p>
<p>Two pig pancreas, cut into small pieces. One tael of green wormwood, mix well and pound into a paste together. Add one catty of Shaoxing wine, stew over low heat for four or five hours, add three cents of cinnamon. (Cinnamon, for lung disease patients, is feared that dry ingredients will cause hemoptysis, so only a small amount is used in the prescription. If it can be eliminated and not used, it will be more stable. Also, lung disease patients should not drink alcohol, so it is stewed for a long time to allow the alcohol to evaporate, so that it has no alcohol odor at all.) Squeeze with cloth to filter out the residue. Drink one warm cup each morning and evening. After about seven days, the wine is finished. If you feel that the condition has improved slightly, you may continue to take it. However, the original text did not discuss whether this method can also be used to treat severe cases.

<p>(2) Mr. Jiang Yilan's discussion on the treatment of tuberculosis in the Social Service column on June 23 said that soaking ginkgo biloba in rapeseed oil for 100 days and taking it has a considerable effect. According to the Western name of ginkgo biloba, NutofGingko, it belongs to the seeds of Ginkgo biloba of the Ginkgoaceae family, which can be used for food and medicine. In ancient Chinese medical books, it is said that it is sweet, bitter, and peaceful, enters the lung meridian, benefits lung qi, calms asthma and cough, and sterilizes and expels insects. However, Rongciye of Japan tested aquatic plants and said that it should be classified as an antispasmodic drug. Unfortunately, we are busy with diagnosis and treatment all day long, and we have not been able to add a detailed chemical test. I think vitamin-like things should also be contained in it. As for oils, they are especially essential for lung disease nutrition. Now that cod liver oil is not easy to buy, then whether it is soybean oil or rapeseed oil, its heat generation Carikie should be easier and more than edible protein and starch. As for saying that this medicine can cure general tuberculosis, it has not been scientifically proven, and more research is needed from high-ranking colleagues. We must conduct real-world trials in various lung disease sanatoriums before we can get a clue. (Youzhu Medical Society)</p>
<p>(3) The Social Service column contains a discussion on the treatment of tuberculosis with rapeseed oil soaked in ginkgo biloba. I have quite a bit of knowledge about tuberculosis and have also tried using rapeseed oil without ginkgo biloba, which is quite effective. It can kill all invertebrate small insects, and its effect is the same as using mercury. Ginkgo biloba is produced by the ginkgo tree and is rich in combing yellow matter. It can also kill bacteria and detoxify. And it has fatty properties, which can replenish the lungs, and it can really be a good medicine for treating tuberculosis. (Chen Qichang)</p>
