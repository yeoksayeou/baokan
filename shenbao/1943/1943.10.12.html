<h3>社評　論政治上的「以毒攻毒」</h3>
<p>「以毒攻毒」，原是醫學上的一種術語，一種治險症的　變方法，在病人中毒或發生毒患之時，投以另一種毒藥，以期達到救治的目的。當然，醫者也明知所投的毒藥，稍有　池，足以致病者之命。所以，必須注意幾個條件，第一，必須詳細斷定毒病的性質與程度，絕無其他治法，而非施用投毒不可。第二，必須考察病人的體質，是否經得起「以毒攻毒」的猛劑？第三，必須注意所投之毒，對於治毒是否有確實把握，是否會發生其他反應或副作用？第四，絕不能視為試騐，必須　到原患之毒一一經投毒，是否反促之及早致命？如果不加硏究，謬然下藥，則不僅不能收獲「以毒攻毒」之效，也許提早斷送了病人的生命。所以，雖為名醫也決不願濫施「以毒攻毒」的治法。</p>
<p>我們認為醫學上的「以毒攻毒」，雖則是行險之法，但是，因為毒藥與毒病相遇，起其化學作用，相尅相消，使原毒消失，尙有醫藥學的科學上根據。</p>
<p>這個醫藥學上的術語，行險的醫法—「以毒攻毒」，在政治上也曾有人借用。民國以來，前有袁項城，後有蔣介石，都曾用為試騐，而結果失敗。現在此說又有倡言，也許借用者的用心，是在挽救政治上的毒病，消滅政治上的危機，而期於政治淸明。可是，根本上政治與醫學是二件事，尤其是「以毒攻毒」一點，在醫學上有其科學的　據，而在政治學上絕無事實的根據。我們知道倡言政治上「以毒攻毒」者，是根據於醫學上的理論，殊不知醫學上的「以毒攻毒」，因為毒藥與毒病相遇發生化學作用而相消於無形，於是毒病消失；政治上的「以毒攻毒」，毒與毒相遇，非兩毒合流為患，即此毒伏而彼毒起，不可能相消於無形，因為人與藥究　不同，人與人決不能發生化學作用。這一理論極為明易淺顯。</p>
<p>所以，醫學上的「以毒攻毒」，非先解決上面所說的四大條件之前，雖為鼎鼎名醫，不敢輕易施用，草菅人命。對於政治上的「以毒攻毒」，當然絕無濫用之理。况且，醫學上「以毒攻毒」，縱是債事，不過一命犧牲。而政治上「以毒攻毒」的失敗，則犧牲者為人民大衆，其輕重之間，何啻　壤。我們願就人民大衆立塲，正吿倡言政治上「以毒攻毒」之說者，千萬不可以行險之法，作為試騐，少數人之試騐失敗事小，而多數人民的枉　犧牲則事大。</p>
<p>政治上的通常設施，唯一的目標，總以安定民生為最要。政治上的緊要措施，也應以保全人民元氣為主。如果認為某一區域的政治現象，已有毒菌存在，此際最重要者應硏究其毒菌原因，用正當方法迅速肅淸毒菌，拯救人民於水火之中。假令不設想正當的肅淸毒菌方法，而採用「以毒攻毒」，其結果不出二途：其一，兩毒相遇，不因新舊關係，而惟有强併弱者，其毒益甚。其二，舊毒縱被消滅，而新毒代之滋生。不特如此，在兩毒相尅之際，原因毒菌戕蝕之人民元氣，已甚虧虛，再經一番　折，其元氣之虛損，可想而知，此與政治上緊要措施，應以保全人民元氣之旨，適相逕庭。所以，此種不以人民為重的政治措施，「以毒攻毒」的行險之法，決許不會取得大衆的信賴，也決計不為智勇的政治家所採用。我們對於因用人不當而諉稱「以毒攻毒」者，實未敢抺　理智的隨聲附和，而不辭以亢激的態度指陳得失，以為人民大衆力爭，寗為少數人怒目，不能為大衆所痛苦者而隱忍。</p>
<p>人各有長，亦各有短，用人所長而舍棄其短，是為用人得當。誤短為長或用其所短而埋沒所長，是為用人不當。用人當者事克舉，用人不當者事必僨。是為常理。試舉一例，有人擅於酬應，辦理娛樂事業是其所長，則惟娛樂事業才可發揮其所長，在其個人事業而言，可以成功，即在娛樂事業本身而言，幫助社會繁榮，予人業餘　興，亦有其正當作用。如果强其捨棄娛樂事業，而以之辦理政治甚至警政，是為誤短為長，用其所短埋沒其長，其結果，個人的娛樂事業因此而减色，事尙微小，而警政的必然僨事，貽人民大衆以痛苦，事則重大。</p>
<p>國家對於用人行政，原有銓叙與考試制度，今考試制度，未見普遍推行，因而銓政實未許有名無實，新進官員，對於資歷學識與職務是否相稱？必須發揮銓衡的超然性能，如有不當，即須據　駁議，以盡監察職務。推荐者縱有主觀上的成見，在銓衡者客觀上的判斷之下，也不能通過。因此，我們要求各級政府機關，充分運用與發揮法規所賦予的權　，發生作用。政治修明，原在於每一機關合理發展。猶之機器旋轉，雖一鏍釘，不能　動，致貽整個失其　活。　各級政治負責當局，　同三致意於政治修明之道，而勉力實踐，我們代表人民馨香禱祝！</p>

<h3>三國會議　定下週舉行</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十一日中央社電　德國新聞社引「斯德哥爾摩日報」之倫敦通訊稱：報章評論注意多日之三國會議，或將於本月十七日在莫斯科舉行，其閉會期將在本月底，蘇聯將因該項會議在蘇境舉行而獲得心理上之優勢。</p>
<p>瑞　京城十一日中央社電　海通社訉：瑞典報紙駐倫敦防員發表論文，檢討未來之莫斯科會議，略稱：英，美人士以為英。美或將接受蘇聯之要求，英國觀察家相信，英，美，蘇三國頗有成立共同政策之可能，即波蘭問題亦可解決。倫敦方面瞭解蘇聯在心理上處於有利地位，因會議地點充滿勝利之歡樂空氣也，但希望蘇聯瞭解對德作戰之共同陣綫之利益。瑞典報紙駐紐約訪員甚至預料美國將完全讓步，因美國消息靈通人士以為，莫斯科或將發生驚人事件，關於各國安全所必需之措置，不復有紛歧之意見，安全問題，在莫斯科會議中，將處於重要之地位。各國拒絕蘇聯之領土要求，但美國為達到對蘇完全諒解之目的，亦不惜放棄其意見。美國雖欲袒護芬蘭及波羅的　各國，然疆界之劃分或將重實際而輕理想，對於軍略需要之考慮，或多於對少數民族權利之考慮。</p>
<h3>美機盲炸海防　越空戰熾烈　仰光郊外擊落兩敵機</h3>

<h3>歐戰與巴爾幹諸國（三）</h3>
<p>羅馬尼亞</p>
<p>如共說反軸心國在巴爾幹的謀略目標是保加利亞，那麼，敵人的軍事攻擊的對象第一國家是羅馬尼亞。</p>
<p>鑒於義大利的投降，有許多人觀測今日英美將在　爾瑪提亞海岸作登陸戰，這顯然在覬覦羅馬尼亞油田。據英美方面的見解，為削弱德國的抗戰力，必須奪獲營爾工業地帶，南部西萊奇亞，羅馬尼亞油田三地中之任何一地。總之，羅馬尼亞對德國戰爭經濟的貢獻，有着頗高的評價。因此，英美空軍敢於用一五〇至二○〇架的大編隊，往返飛翔二·四〇〇哩，而實施頗為困難的普洛愛斯基轟炸。這時候據說英美空軍喪失五十六架，約當來襲飛機的總數三分之一。說明了從現在的英美空軍基地轟炸羅馬尼亞油田地帶是如何的困難。</p>
<p>羅國的外交</p>
<p>歐洲戰爭一開始後，我們當還記得以這羅馬尼亞油田為中心而演着激烈的外交戰。一九三九年十一月，德羅通商協定成立，而英國則供給羅馬尼亞飛機以與之對抗。</p>
<p>一九四〇年，羅馬尼亞政府設置石油統制委員會，由政府統制所產石油。英法方面向羅國政府發出警告，勿以英法系公司的石油供給德國，而德羅的協力，漸趨密切。</p>
<p>六月末、蘇聯進駐貝薩拉此亞，普洛維那羅馬尼亞喪失其領土的一七％，人口三百五十萬。</p>
<p>七月十日，羅國闡明對輸心協力態度，發出通告否認一九三九年四月十日的關於保障羅國的英法宣言。之後因領土問題，羅馬尼亞的國內情勢略見動搖。九月六日，德義指使安托納斯古要求親英法色彩濃厚的國王加羅爾退位，皇太子密哈一世登位。與此同時，安托納斯古內閣成立，羅國統治的大權，盡委於安托納斯古將軍，國王以　令承認羅國為鐵衛團國民、王義國家。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞的國家主義體制於此完成，反對的共產黨在康斯坦柴，菩加萊斯特等地展開示威運動，德軍十萬為保護石油資源而進駐羅國。這時候安托納斯古將軍聲明說：「德軍的進駐，乃基於羅國政府的請求，以羅國軍隊的再建為目的一，德方亦發表依從羅國的希望，派遺軍事使節團，並為保護該國油田而派遣飛行隊。</p>
<p>成為上述羅馬尼亞國內大變革之直接的原因者，乃繼割讓貝薩拉比亞之後的第二次領土割　。即據德義的温那裁定，把外四爾伐尼來割讓於匈牙利（八月三十日），並南吐勃魯奇亞的割讓於保加利亞。因這三次的領土割讓，羅馬尼亞喪失領土近四萬平方哩人口四百萬。</p>
<p>伹安托納斯古將軍的獨裁政權，順利地渡過了國內動搖的危機，因推進對德協力政策，政治上，經濟上國內均告安定，同年十一月，簽定加入日德義三國同盟，成為軸心國的一員，翌年二月十日，英羅國交斷絕。</p>
<p>六月，德蘇戰爭勃發，充滿着奪取貝薩拉比亞之宿恨的羅馬尼亞，欣然參加對蘇戰，和德軍一同進攻烏克蘭，除奪還員薩拉比亞，普果維那外，更占領奧迪薩及至杜尼愛斯脫爾河的地帶，而稱之為外蘭斯特尼愛斯脫拉。之後羅軍繼續與德軍協積極力，在斯達林格勒奮戰，在今夏的戰事中，為防備巴爾幹而從東部戰綫撒退。</p>
<p>產業與貿易</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞是巴爾幹諸國中資源最豐當的國家。居民約百分之七十從事農業，為多瑙河沿岸諸國中的主要農產國。主要產業為石油。戰前產八七〇萬噸，占世界第四位，即在目前據說亦產六〇〇萬噸之多。大半運至德國，在德國戰力上有極大貢獻。</p>
<p>就貿易而言，石油穀物占壓倒的比率，使該國貿易成為出超。輸出國在歐洲開戰後德國的地位大見增進，一九四〇年包括捷克在內的大德國，在輸入方面占總額的六四，三％，在輸出方面占四九，三％。最近的統計無從獲悉，但對德貿易自與反軸心國絕交後自然更趨增加。</p>
<p>匈牙利</p>
<p>一九二〇年三月，打倒貝拉貢赤色政權的功臣　爾第提督，自經國民議會推　為攝政以來始終指導匈　，其國內態勢和納粹德國的協力密切地結合起來，匈牙利在一九二一年宣言為匈牙利王國，但王位虛　，　爾第攝政成為匈牙利國的獨裁者，委以政治上的全權。更據一九三七年的法律，　爾第攝政即對議會亦無責任。至一九四二年二月，尼古拉斯，霍爾第以年高辭攝政，其子史蒂芬，霍爾第任攝政代表，但史蒂芬，霍爾第在視察德蘇戰錢中陣亡，老霍爾第重任攝政。</p>
<p>匈牙利是前次大戰失敗後不能不忍受最大犠牲的國家，因一九二〇年六月的特里農條約，百分之七十的領土，及百分之六十三的人口。被强迫分割於隣接諸國。所損失的人口計包括南斯拉夫四十六萬人，捷克百萬人，羅馬尼亞百六十萬人，匈牙利每　機會，輒企圖恢復這失地，德國自納粹政權成立以來，支持　匈牙利的要求，而與之結成密切的外交關係。</p>
<p>但匈牙利多年來的宿望恢復失地，直至一九三八年十月的　恩漢會談後，十一月二日德義外相舉行溫那會議，方才達到，恢復了捷領四，二〇〇平方哩的領土，匈牙利人七〇萬，斯洛伐克人一〇萬，羅台努人九萬，收歸其統治下。</p>
<p>匈牙利第二個收復失地的機會，乃在一九四〇年六月。蘇聯進駐貝薩拉比亞，　追羅馬尼亞的時候。此時匈牙利在羅馬尼亞國境曾實施大規模預備動員，匈羅二軍之間曾發生衝突，至七月十日的德義匈三國會談，匈牙利貫澈了收復羅馬尼亞失地的要求，而正式予以決定者，為德　匈羅的四國會談，結果，匈牙利從羅馬尼亞收囘了　里農條約中所喪失的德外西爾伐尼亞地方的北半部分。</p>
<p>年十一月二十日，匈牙利在日德義三國同盟的議定書上簽字加入，甸牙利協力軸心國的態度，在法律上予以確認。</p>
<p>至一九四一年二月，匈牙利第三次恢復失地的機會又來了。當德義侵入南斯拉夫時，匈牙利進軍於特里農條約中所割讓於南國的領土，獲得了泰伊斯及多瑙河二河間的三角地帶。</p>
<p>這樣，匈牙利因和德國協力而得以漸次恢復特里農條約的失地，故親　色彩較其他巴爾幹諸國更為濃厚，最近曦會因伊姆雷第一派的反政府態度而無期延會，亦為了想更强化現在匈牙利的對德協力政策</p>
<p>和德國的經濟協力</p>
<p>根據凡爾賽條約分割歐洲諸小國，乃係漠視資本主義經濟要求更廣大交易圈的法則，因各國的關　壁壘而孤立化的歐洲諸小國的國民經濟，瀕於危機，匈牙利亦非例外，造成了經的不　　氣。但因　　基內閣之現實的　　政策，獲得了羅得尼亞，而增加了版圖，人目之後，再加上對德經濟協力政策，使匈牙利濟復興起來。一九三九年九月歐洲戰爭的勃發，使穀物的價格上漲，替匈牙利造成了有利的地盤。</p>
<p>伹歐洲戰爭的進展，使匈牙利英法二國的關係斷絕，匈牙利經濟乃完全依存德國。和此同時，因成立了限制向來支配工商業的猶太人之參加企業，故企業上德國資木也被賦予了全面進出的機會，一九四一年七月下句舉行的德匈經濟協議會上，匈牙利的農業和消費財工業在二國的共同之下發展起來，謀匈牙利的輕工業品和德國的重工業製品交換，更在金融部門方面，和德國之問，締結了把和德國支配下的歐洲諸國的支付結算，經由柏林而實施的集中濟算協定。（翔：譯自同盟世界週報一二二六號）</p>

<h3>波羅的海岸　德美大空戰　德艦主力集中琴尼亞</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　美第八空軍轟炸機　，九日午大舉空襲波羅的海沿岸之琴尼亞港（Gdynia），德戰鬥機隊得訊後，即　飛迎擊，遂於自哥德闌至但澤灣之高空。展開　數小時之激戰。德施密特機於交綏後，僅於九分鐘內即擊落美轟炸機四架。又美空軍經迫近海岸地帶時，德軍地上高射砲隊亦即砲彈齊發，結果降落美四發動轟炸機六十二架，駕駛　以一機平均十人計算，可知美軍損失駕駛員已逾六百名。一般觀測，認為此次美軍之長驅　炸波羅的海沿岸，或係獲悉德艦隊主力已向琴尼亞港方面集結所致。但經德軍奮勇邀擎，僅安絡拉姆及哥　哈芬兩布之市街及市民稍受損害，於空戰時德方亦損失戰鬥機十一架。</p>

<h3>歐戰與巴爾幹諸國（三）</h3>
<p>羅馬尼亞</p>
<p>如其說反軸心國在巴爾幹的謀略目標是保加利亞，那麼，敵人的軍畫攻擊的對象第一國家是羅馬尼亞。</p>
<p>鑒於義大利的投降，有許多人觀測今日英美將在　爾瑪提亞海軍作登陸戰，這　然在　　羅馬尼亞油田，據英美方面的見解，為削弱德國的抗戰力，必須奪獲魯爾工業地帶，南部西萊奇亞，羅馬尼亞油田三地中之任何一地。總之，羅馬尼亞對德國戰爭經濟的　戲，有著頗高的評價。因此，英美空軍敢於用一五〇至二〇〇架的大編隊。往返飛翔二。四〇〇哩，而實施頗爲困難的普據說英美空軍　失五十六架，約當來襲飛　的總數三分之一。這說明了從現在的英美空軍基地轟炸羅馬尼亞油田地帶是如何的困難。</p>
<p>羅國的外交</p>
<p>歐洲戰爭一周始後</p>
<p>我們當還記得以這羅馬尼亞油田爲中心而演著激烈的外交戰。一九三九年十一月，德羅通商協定成立，而英國則供給羅馬尼亞飛機以與之對抗</p>
<p>一九四〇年，羅馬尼亞政府設置石油統制委員會，由政府統制所產石油。英法方面向羅國政府發出警告，勿以英法系公司的石油供給德國，而德羅的協力，漸　密切。</p>
<p>六月末、蘇聯進駐貝薩拉此亞，普洛維那羅馬尼亞喪失其領土的一七％，人口三百五十萬。</p>
<p>七月十日，羅國闡明對軸心協力態度，發出通告否認一九三九年四月十日的關於保障羅國的英法宣言。之後因領土問題，羅馬尼亞的國內情勢略見動搖。九月六日，德義指使安托納斯古要求親英法色彩濃厚的國王加羅爾退位，皇太子密哈一世登位。與此同時，安托納斯古內閣成立，羅國統治的大權，　委於安托納斯古將軍，國王以剌令承認羅國爲鐵術團國民主義國家。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞的國家主義體制於此完成，反對的共產黨在康斯坦柴，普加萊斯特等地展開示威運動，德軍十萬爲保護石油資源而進駐羅國。這時候安托納斯古將軍聲明說：德軍的進駐，乃基於羅國政府的請求，以羅國軍隊的再建為目的一，德方亦發表依從羅國的希望，派遣軍事使節團，並爲保護該國油田而派遣飛行隊。</p>
<p>成爲上述羅馬尼亞國內大變革之直接的原因者，乃繼割據貝薩拉比亞之後的第二次領土割據。即據德義的溫那裁定，把外西爾伐尼亞割據於匈牙利（八月三十日），並南吐勃費奇亞的割讓於保加利亞。因這三次的領土割讓，羅馬尼亞喪失領土近四萬平方哩人口四百萬。</p>
<p>但安托納斯古將軍的獨　政權，順利地渡　過了國內動搖的危機，因推進對德協力政策，政治上，經濟上國內均告安定，同年十一月，簽定加人日德義三國同盟，成爲軸心國的一員，翌年二月十日，英羅國交斷絕。</p>
<p>六月，德蘇戰爭勃發，充滿著奪取員薩拉比亞之宿恨的羅馬尼亞，欣然參加對蘇戰，和德軍一同進攻烏克闌，除奪還貝薩拉比亞，普果維那外，更占領奧迪薩及至杜尼愛斯脫爾河的地帶，而稱之爲外闌</p>
<p>斯特尼愛斯脫拉。之後羅軍繼續與德軍協積極力，在斯達林格勒奮戰，在今夏的戰事中，爲防備巴爾幹而從東部戰綫撤退。</p>
<p>產業與貿易</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞是巴爾幹諸國中資源最豐當的國家。居民約百分之七十從事農業，爲多瑙河沿岸諸國中的主要農產國。主要產業爲石汕，戰前產八七〇萬噸，占世界第四位，即在目前據說亦產六〇〇萬噸之多。大半述至德國，在德國戰力上有極大貢獻。</p>
<p>就貿易而言，石油穀物占壓倒的比率，使該國貿易成爲出超。輸出國在歐洲開戰後德國的地位大見增進，一九四〇年包括捷克在內的大德國，在輸入方面占總額的六四，三％，，在輸出方面占四九，三％。最近的統計無從獲悉，但對德貿易自與反軸心國絕交後自然更趨增加。</p>
<p>匈牙利</p>
<p>一九二〇年三月，打倒貝拉貢赤色政權的功臣　爾第提督，自經國民議會推　爲攝政以來始終指導匈國，其國內態勢和納粹德國的協力密切地結合起來。匈牙利在一九二一年宜言爲匈牙利王國，但王位虛腮，　爾第攝政成爲匈牙利岡的獨裁者，委以政治上的全權。更據一九三七年的法律，　爾第攝政即對議食亦無責任。至一九四二年二月，尼古拉斯，霍爾第以年高　攝政，其子史蒂芬，　爾第任攝政代表，但史蒂芬，霍爾第在視察德蘇戰綫中陣亡，老霍爾第重任攝政。</p>
<p>甸牙利是前次大戰失敗後不能不忍受最大犧牲的國家，因一九二〇年六月的特里農條約，百分之七十的　土，及百分之六十三的人口。被强迫分割於隣接諸國。所損失的人口計包括南斯拉夫四十六萬人，捷克百萬人，羅馬尼亞百六萬人，匈牙利每遇　會，輒企恢復這失地，德國自納粹政權成立以來，支持　匈牙利的要求。而與之結成密切的外交關係。</p>
<p>但匈牙利多年來的宿望恢復失地，直至一九三八年十月的繆恩漢會談後，十一月二日德義外相舉行溫那會議，方才達到，恢復了捷領四，二〇〇平方哩的領土，匈牙利人七〇萬，斯洛伐克人一〇萬，羅台努人九萬。收歸其統治下。</p>
<p>匈牙利第二個收復失地的機會，乃在一九四〇年六月。蘇聯進駐貝薩拉比亞，　追羅馬尼亞的時候。此時匈牙利在羅馬尼亞國境曾實施大規模預備動員，匈羅二軍之間曾發生衝突，至七月十日的　義匈三國會談，匈牙利貫澈了收復羅馬尼亞失地的要求，而正式予以決定者，爲德義匈羅的四國會談，結果。匈牙利從羅馬尼亞收回了特里農條約中所喪失的德外四爾伐尼亞地方的北半部分。</p>
<p>同年，十一月二十日，匈牙利在日德義三國同盟的議定　上簽字加入，匈牙利協力軸心國的態度。在法律上予以確認。</p>
<p>至一九四一年二月，匈牙利第三次恢復失地的機會又來了。當德義侵入南斯拉夫時，匈牙利進而於特裏農條約中所割讓於南國的領土，獲得了泰伊斯及多瑙河二河間的三角地帶。</p>
<p>這樣，匈牙利因和德國協力而得以漸次恢復特里農條約的失地，故親　色彩較其他巴爾幹諸國更爲濃厚，最近議會因伊姆雷第一派的反政府態度而無期延會，亦爲了想更强化現在匈牙利的對德協力政策</p>
<p>和德國的經濟協力</p>
<p>根據凡爾賽條約分割歐洲諸小國，乃係漠視資本主義經濟要求更廣大交易圈的法則，因各國的關稅壁壘而孤立化的歐洲諸小國的國民經濟，瀕於危機，匈牙利亦非例外，造成了經的不　　氣，因　　基內閣之現實的親　政策，獲得了羅得尼亞，而增加了版圖，人口之後，再加上對德經濟協力政策，使匈牙利經濟復興起來。一九三九年九月歐洲戰爭的勃發，使穀物的價格上漲，替匈牙利沿成了有利的地盤。</p>
<p>但歐洲戰爭的進　，使匈牙利與英法二國的關係斷絕，匈牙利經濟乃完全依有德國。和此同時，因成立了限制向來支配工商業的猶太人之參加企業，故企　上德國資本也被賦予了全面進出的機會，一九四一年七月下旬舉行的德匈經濟協議會上，匈牙利的農業和消費財工業在二國的共同之下發展起來。謀匈牙利的輕工業品和德國的重工業製品交換，更在金融部門方面，和德國之問，締結了把和德國支配下的歐洲諸國的支付結算，經由柏林而實施的　中淸算協定。（翔：　自同盟世界過報一二二</p>

<h3>Editorial: On Political "Fighting Poison with Poison"</h3>
<p>"Fighting poison with poison" was originally a term in medicine, a method of last resort for treating dangerous illnesses. When a patient is poisoned or suffers from a toxic condition, another poison is administered in the hope of achieving a cure. Of course, the physician also knows that the administered poison, if slightly mishandled, can be fatal. Therefore, several conditions must be considered: first, the nature and severity of the toxic illness must be carefully determined, and there must be no other treatment method available before administering the poison. Second, the patient's constitution must be examined to see if it can withstand the drastic measure of "fighting poison with poison." Third, it must be carefully assessed whether the administered poison is certain to counteract the original poison, and whether it will cause other reactions or side effects. Fourth, it must never be regarded as an experiment; it must be ascertained whether the original poison will be hastened to its deadly end by the administered poison. If the medicine is prescribed rashly without careful study, it will not only fail to achieve the effect of "fighting poison with poison," but may also hasten the patient's demise. Therefore, even famous doctors are unwilling to recklessly administer the treatment of "fighting poison with poison."</p>
<p>We believe that the medical practice of "fighting poison with poison," although a risky method, has a scientific basis in medical science, because when a poison meets a toxic illness, they produce a chemical reaction, counteracting and neutralizing each other, causing the original poison to disappear.</p>
<p>This medical term, this risky medical practice—"fighting poison with poison"—has also been borrowed by some in politics. Since the founding of the Republic of China, both Yuan Shikai and later Chiang Kai-shek, have used it as an experiment, but with failed results. Now, this saying is being advocated again. Perhaps the intention of those who borrow the term is to save politics from toxic illnesses, eliminate political crises, and achieve political clarity. However, politics and medicine are fundamentally two different things, especially with regard to "fighting poison with poison." In medicine, it has its scientific basis, while in politics, it has absolutely no factual basis. We know that those who advocate "fighting poison with poison" in politics are basing it on medical theory, but they are unaware that in medicine, "fighting poison with poison" works because when a poison meets a toxic illness, they produce a chemical reaction and neutralize each other, causing the toxic illness to disappear. In politics, when poison meets poison, they either combine and flow together to cause harm, or one poison lies dormant while the other rises. It is impossible for them to neutralize each other, because people and medicine are ultimately different, and people cannot produce chemical reactions. This theory is extremely clear, easy, and simple.</p>
<p>Therefore, in medicine, even a famous doctor would not dare to lightly administer "fighting poison with poison" without first resolving the four conditions mentioned above, lest they treat human life lightly. In politics, there is certainly no reason to abuse "fighting poison with poison." Moreover, in medicine, even if "fighting poison with poison" fails, it only results in one life being sacrificed. But in politics, the failure of "fighting poison with poison" sacrifices the masses of people, and the difference in importance is like heaven and earth. We wish to stand on the side of the masses of people and solemnly warn those who advocate "fighting poison with poison" in politics: do not use a risky method as an experiment. The failure of a few people's experiment is a small matter, but the needless sacrifice of the majority of people is a big matter.</p>
<p>The sole objective of normal political measures is always to stabilize the people's livelihood as the most important thing. Important political measures should also focus on preserving the people's vitality. If it is believed that toxic bacteria already exist in the political situation of a certain region, the most important thing at this moment is to investigate the cause of the toxic bacteria, use legitimate methods to quickly eliminate the toxic bacteria, and save the people from fire and water. If legitimate methods of eliminating toxic bacteria are not considered, but instead "fighting poison with poison" is adopted, the result will be one of two outcomes: first, when the two poisons meet, they will not consider old or new relationships, but only the stronger will merge with the weaker, making the poison even worse. Second, even if the old poison is eliminated, a new poison will emerge in its place. Not only that, but during the clash of the two poisons, the people's vitality, which was already greatly depleted by the corrosion of the original toxic bacteria, will suffer even more damage after another round of turmoil. This is contrary to the purpose of important political measures, which should be to preserve the people's vitality. Therefore, this kind of political measure that does not value the people, this risky method of "fighting poison with poison," will definitely not gain the trust of the masses, and will definitely not be adopted by wise and courageous politicians. As for those who misuse people and then claim to be "fighting poison with poison," we dare not blindly agree with them out of a lack of reason. We are willing to point out the gains and losses with an impassioned attitude, and strive for the benefit of the masses of people. We would rather be glared at by a few people than endure the suffering of the masses.</p>
<p>Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Using a person's strengths while abandoning their weaknesses is the proper way to use people. Mistaking weaknesses for strengths, or using a person's weaknesses while burying their strengths, is the improper way to use people. Those who use people properly will succeed in their endeavors, while those who use people improperly will surely fail. This is common sense. To give an example, someone who is good at socializing and managing entertainment businesses has found their strength. Only in the entertainment industry can their strengths be brought into full play. In terms of their personal career, they can succeed. In terms of the entertainment industry itself, they can help social prosperity and provide people with leisure activities, which also has its legitimate role. However, if they are forced to abandon the entertainment industry and instead manage politics or even police administration, it would be mistaking weaknesses for strengths and burying their strengths. As a result, the individual's entertainment business will be diminished, which is a small matter. However, the inevitable failure of police administration will cause suffering to the masses of people, which is a big matter.</p>
<p>The country originally had a system of appointment and examination for using people in administration. Now, the examination system has not been widely implemented, so the appointment system is practically nominal. When new officials are appointed, whether their qualifications, knowledge, and experience are commensurate with their duties must be assessed with impartiality, and any improprieties must be rejected to fulfill the duties of oversight. Even if the recommender has subjective biases, they cannot pass under the objective judgment of the assessor. Therefore, we demand that government agencies at all levels fully utilize and exert the powers conferred by laws and regulations and ensure their effectiveness. Political clarity originates from the rational development of every agency. It is like a machine turning; even a single screw cannot be moved arbitrarily, lest the whole machine lose its vitality. May all political authorities at all levels share the same dedication to political clarity and strive to put it into practice. We, on behalf of the people, offer our sincere prayers and blessings!</p>

<h3>Nine Cities Including Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou Implement Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Establish Local Materials Investigation Committee</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): In order to suppress prices and stabilize the people's livelihood, the National Government has promulgated emergency economic measures for wartime, gradually implementing control over various major commodities. Among them, rice, being essential to the people's food supply, has already been assigned a special department to be responsible for unified distribution. Among all major commodities, cotton yarn and cotton cloth are also most closely related to the people's livelihood. Therefore, the control of these two commodities in the Shanghai area was explicitly ordered by the National Government in August of this year and actively implemented. Since its implementation, it has achieved the expected success in suppressing prices and stabilizing the people's livelihood. It is learned that the administrative authorities have also designated nine cities—Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and others—to conduct investigations and registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth inventories outside of Shanghai. Furthermore, the organizational rules for the local materials investigation committee will be officially announced on the 12th to allow for the establishment of committees to conduct thorough investigations. Chen Junhui, the Minister of Industry, specifically issued a statement yesterday, clarifying the intent and urging merchants to understand the government's earnestness in promoting wartime economic policies, truthfully apply for registration, and fulfill the fundamental objective of stabilizing the people's livelihood. The statement of Minister Chen and the organizational rules of the local materials investigation committee are published below:</p>
<p>Minister Chen Discusses the Significance of Registration</p>
<p>The Minister of Industry issued the following statement regarding the handling of cotton yarn and cotton cloth registration and investigation in major cities outside of Shanghai: The National Government, in order to suppress prices and stabilize the people's livelihood, has had to gradually implement control over various major commodities. Among the major commodities, cotton yarn and cotton cloth are most closely related to the people's livelihood. Therefore, the control of these two commodities in the Shanghai area has long been explicitly ordered and actively implemented. The amount of cotton yarn and cotton cloth inventory in major cities outside of Shanghai should also be thoroughly investigated. Now, the Executive Yuan has designated nine cities—Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Nantong, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Wuhu—to handle the registration and investigation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth. Regarding registration, the relevant local authorities in the above cities are actively implementing the registration rules for major commodities promulgated by the Ministry of Industry. At the beginning of the process, it is inevitable that a small number of merchants will take a wait-and-see attitude and intend to conceal information. To prevent such malpractices, the Executive Yuan has specifically promulgated the organizational rules for the local materials investigation committee to allow for the establishment of committees to conduct thorough investigations. If concealment is discovered, severe penalties will be imposed in accordance with Article 3 of the Regulations for Punishing Hoarding of Major Commodities, without any leniency. It is hoped that merchants in the above cities will understand the government's earnestness in promoting wartime economic policies and promptly apply for registration truthfully. At the same time, it is hoped that the personnel handling the investigation will be considerate of the difficulties faced by merchants and handle matters impartially, so as to fulfill the fundamental objective of stabilizing the people's livelihood.</p>

(Article 16) These rules shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>Minister Horiuchi Issues Statement</p>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): Japanese Minister Horiuchi recently issued a statement regarding the registration and investigation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in major cities outside of Shanghai, stating that the Chinese National Government, in order to suppress prices and stabilize the people's livelihood, previously implemented registration, investigation, and purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai. This time, it has decided to implement registration of cotton yarn and cloth in nine cities, including Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Nantong, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Wuhu. This time, in addition to implementing the rules for the registration of major commodities, the Executive Yuan also promulgated the organizational rules for the local materials investigation committee on October 12 by executive order to allow local authorities to establish committees to supervise and promote the investigation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, with the aim of achieving perfection. As for the investigation committee, it is also a joint organization with Japanese committee members participating, as in Shanghai. The Japanese side will fully cooperate with the registration and investigation. In this regard, it is hoped that Japanese operators will take the lead in setting an example of fair registration and obey the investigation, so that the economic control under the Greater East Asia War can be perfected.</p>
<h3>Central Government Commemorates National Day; Chairman Wang's Address</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch): Today is the National Day of the 32nd year of the Republic of China. The entire country, at a time when the National Government has joined the war, friendly nations have returned concessions and abolished extraterritoriality, and national independence has been completed, and with the Greater East Asia War having laid a solid foundation for inevitable victory, is inspired and jubilant on this joyous National Day. In addition to uniformly displaying flags for celebration, various localities are also holding separate celebratory ceremonies. At the central government level, a grand celebration ceremony was held this morning at 9:00 AM in the National Government Auditorium. Chairman Wang, along with the heads of various ministries and commissions, attended. Civil officials wore new national uniforms or blue robes and black jackets, while military officers were all in full dress uniform. At 9:00 AM sharp, the grand ceremony began amidst the resounding music. The heads of the various ministries and commissions took their seats, and the chairman took his place. After leading the attendees in performing the rituals, the chairman delivered an address, providing a thorough explanation of the significance of this year's National Day celebration. He reviewed the past, encouraged the future, and all attendees listened respectfully, feeling exceptionally inspired.

<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch): German President Hitler sent a telegram to Chairman Wang of the National Government of our country to offer congratulations on the 10th, the first National Day commemoration since our country joined the war.</p>
<h3>Economy Strengthened After Materials Control</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): The National Government previously established a materials investigation committee to investigate hoarding. It has thoroughly investigated and dealt with the illegal hoarding of large quantities of major materials by merchants in Shanghai, and the results have been quite significant. In particular, after the investigation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, which are closely related to the people's livelihood, strict control has been implemented, allowing supply and demand to be balanced, which has greatly benefited the implementation of wartime economic policies. However, it is difficult to establish an entire wartime economic system by implementing this control policy only in the Shanghai area. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has re-promulgated the organizational rules for the local materials investigation committee, which will take effect immediately to conduct thorough investigations, aiming to obtain clear quantities of the storage of major materials in various important cities.</p>
<h3>Third Germany-Manchukuo Economic Agreement</h3>
<p>Formally Signed Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Xinjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): The third agreement between Manchukuo and Germany was formally signed by representatives of the two countries at the Manchukuo Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 AM on the 11th, and a joint statement was issued. The agreement is effective from the date of signing. From now on, the friendly commercial relations between Manchukuo and Germany will become closer.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): Volkhart, the head of the German economic mission to Manchukuo, along with Rosendell, the general manager of the German East Asia Bank, went to Jilin on the morning of the 10th. They are scheduled to inspect the Songhua River Fengman Power Plant before leaving Xinjing on the 12th.</p>
<p>To implement a comprehensive system of control. After the implementation of these systematic policies, the wartime national economic system will inevitably become more consolidated, and the people's lives will gradually stabilize. This will make the national strength more solid, and there is no doubt that it will be able to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War and establish the co-prosperity of the entire East Asia. However, based on past experience, a small number of merchants may disregard these policies and neglect national laws for the sake of personal gain. It is hoped that the authorities will not be lenient and will severely punish them, so that the cunning and stubborn will be restrained, and the establishment of the wartime economic system will be achieved as soon as possible, which is what the entire nation hopes for.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army in North China Operates Smoothly; Many Communist Strongholds in Western Hebei Swept Away</h3>
<p>Beijing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): The Japanese army in North China believes that the Communists are an obstacle to the construction of North China, so they frequently suppress them. Since mid-September, they have launched autumn anti-communist warfare in various parts of North China. The operation is progressing very smoothly, and as of the 5th of this month, great results have been achieved. It is estimated that over 13,300 Communist troops have been killed or captured, and the Japanese army is currently engaged in a fierce attack. According to the North China Japanese Army authorities, the results of the battle were announced at 4:00 PM on the 11th as follows: 347 Communist facilities have been destroyed, including munitions factories, landmine factories, munitions warehouses, clothing factories, flour mills, grain depots, printing presses, and barracks. 8,757 Communist corpses were left behind, and 4,517 people were captured. The Japanese army captured one mountain gun, 85 machine guns, 30 grenade launchers, 11 mortars, 5641 rifles, 732 pistols and rifles, 265,418 hand grenades, 3,660 landmines, and a large amount of other ammunition, communication equipment, clothing, and grain.</p>
<p>A Certain Base on the Western Hebei Front Line, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): In order to completely destroy the Communist army of the Western Hebei Military Region under Nie Rongzhen, a certain unit of the Japanese army launched a swift attack. Starting from a certain location in the south, they crossed Jianling on September 17, passed through Daomaguan on the 19th, and broke through the landmine field laid by the bandits. On the 24th, they invaded Weizhuang. Another unit advanced westward from Yinfang on the 19th, joined forces at Daomaguan, and approached the First Military Sub-district Headquarters of the bandits on Shenxiandao. Another elite unit of the Japanese army moved out from a certain location on the 16th and 19th, respectively, and swept away the bandits in the Shangzhai and Tianbaidao areas before approaching Shenxiandao, completing the encirclement. They responded to each other and began a fierce attack. The Communists resisted stubbornly, but under the brave and fierce attack of the Japanese army, they were defeated. The Japanese army took the opportunity to break into the Shenxiandao Communist military base on the 24th, annihilating them and thoroughly destroying the military facilities scattered in the area. The objective of the Japanese army has been achieved, and they have turned their sharp edge to vigorously sweep away the First and Second Military Sub-districts of the Communist Western Hebei Military Region and the Yanbei Command. The operation is currently continuing. Furthermore, other units of the Japanese army, in close collaboration with neighboring units, launched a fierce attack on the bandits of the Third Military Region in the east and west of Pingyang (about 16 kilometers west of Lingshanzhen) on the 28th, breaking through the center of the bandits. Another unit of the Japanese army relocated to the west, destroying the bandits in Sasakuramura (about 50 kilometers northwest of Lingshanzhen). Another unit seized the mountain top area on the left bank of the Nianyang River on October 1. Another unit pursued the Fifth Regiment of the bandits lurking in Wanli (15 kilometers west of Chenhua) and its vicinity. Another unit drove away part of the bandits in Liuyuan Village (5 kilometers north of Chenzhuang) at dawn on September 17 and broke into Nanmobacun, 7 kilometers northwest of Chenzhuang. On the other hand, a certain new elite unit of the Japanese army suddenly moved out from the Jinghan Railway line. On September 17, they broke through the mountain chain and launched encirclements everywhere northwest of Koutouzhen (20 kilometers northwest of Xingtai). Several units searched for the 35th Regiment of the bandits in the upper reaches of the Wenbu River. In early September, they captured the bandits near Wendu (about 7 kilometers west of Guosu), Beiping (11 kilometers west of Guosu) and destroyed their facilities.</p>
<p>Purge Near Hankou</p>
<p>Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): The Japanese army in Hankou conducted a purge of the Chongqing army near the area last week, achieving great results. The details are as follows: (A) The Japanese army unit in the Yuehan area of Pubei fought with the First Detachment of the Chongqing army's vanguard force for about two hours near the 20-kilometer north area of Pubei on the 5th evening. The Chongqing army was defeated and fled towards the north. In this battle, the Chongqing side abandoned about 70 bodies. (B) On the Xinyang front, the Japanese army made a surprise attack and broke into the 521st Regiment of the 170th Division of the Chongqing army in Maitangdian (24 kilometers southeast of Xinyang) at dawn on the 9th and attacked them. In this battle, the Chongqing army left behind 63 corpses. (C) On the Yichang front, the Japanese army in Zhanlaobei (18 kilometers southeast of Yichang) attacked the bandit base of Zou Shu, who was active near Tumenwu (10 kilometers west of Zhanlaobei). In addition to capturing the bandit Zou, they also eliminated the bandits entrenched in the area.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Finschhafen, Achieving Great Results; Torobrian Islands Bombed</h3>
<p>Central News Agency from a certain base in the South Pacific, 11th: Five Japanese army planes attacked Finschhafen at 6:00 PM on the 10th. The first plane, at approximately 6:00 PM east of Krestler on the sea, discovered seven or eight enemy boats sailing, and immediately bombed them. Three were sunk, two caught fire, and the rest suffered heavy damage. The second plane, at 6:10 PM, bombed an enemy encampment near Finschhafen, causing two large fires. The third plane, at 6:20 PM, heavily bombed an enemy anti-aircraft artillery position near Finschhafen, hitting one and setting it ablaze. The fourth plane, from 6:20 PM to 6:50 PM, bombed an enemy supply depot near Finschhafen, hitting one and causing an explosion. Also, three enemy boats were found heading north east of Ant Point and were bombed. The fifth plane bombed a supply depot near Ant Point, inflicting heavy damage. Other Japanese planes observed the aforementioned supply depot receiving intense anti-aircraft fire from enemy ground forces. That plane has not yet returned to base, while the other four planes safely returned.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: A dispatch from a certain Japanese naval base in the South Pacific states: Japanese naval air squadrons have carried out a series of night and day raids on the Troberiand Islands, Kiriwina Island, and Woodlark Island, braving heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire and scoring numerous direct hits. One position on Kiriwina Island was set ablaze. All Japanese planes returned safely. Following this, on the night of the 9th, another attack was launched on Buna and the Troberiand Islands. The enemy airfield at Buna was bombed, causing five fires, two of which exploded. Two other military supply depots also exploded and caught fire. All Japanese planes returned safely.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 10th: Soong Tzu-wen arrived in New Delhi on Saturday from the United States.</p>
<h3>Three-Nation Conference Scheduled for Next Week</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 11th: The German News Agency quoted the "Stockholm Daily News" London correspondent as saying: Newspaper commentators are paying attention to the long awaited three-nation conference, which may be held in Moscow on the 17th of this month and will close at the end of this month. The Soviet Union will gain a psychological advantage because the meeting is held on Soviet territory.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 11th: Haitong News: A Swedish newspaper's London correspondent published an article reviewing the upcoming Moscow conference, stating in brief: British and American personnel believe that Britain and America may accept Soviet demands. The British Observer believes that Britain, America, and the Soviet Union are likely to establish a common policy, and even the Polish question can be resolved. London understands that the Soviet Union is in an advantageous psychological position because the meeting place is filled with a joyful atmosphere of victory. However, it is hoped that the Soviet Union understands the benefits of a united front against Germany. A Swedish newspaper correspondent in New York even predicted that the United States will make complete concessions, because informed American sources believe that surprising events may occur in Moscow and that there will no longer be disagreements regarding measures necessary for the security of each country. The issue of security will be of paramount importance at the Moscow conference. Countries reject Soviet territorial demands, but the United States is willing to abandon its opinions in order to achieve complete understanding with the Soviet Union. Although the United States wants to protect Finland and the Baltic states, the division of borders may emphasize practicality over ideals and give more consideration to military needs than to the rights of ethnic minorities.</p>
<h3>American Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Haiphong; Fierce Air Battles; Two Enemy Planes Shot Down Outside Rangoon</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Hanoi, 11th: The air raids on southern areas of Vietnam by the American air force stationed in China have intensified since the 10th. At 1:30 AM on the 11th, enemy planes came again from the Ha Giang area, indiscriminately bombing Haiphong and strafing the harbor and city streets with machine guns. Due to being fiercely attacked by Japanese anti-aircraft artillery, they fled towards Ha Giang at 2:00 PM. The Japanese military suffered minor damage, but the streets of Haiphong were bombed, causing considerable damage.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 11th: Two enemy planes came to the vicinity of Mingaladon, outside Rangoon, in the middle of the night on the 9th. They were intercepted by Japanese anti-aircraft artillery and completely shot down. The Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>The European War and the Balkan States (3)</h3>
<p>Romania</p>
<p>If one says that the strategic objective of the anti-Axis powers in the Balkans is Bulgaria, then the first country targeted for military attack by the enemy is Romania.</p>
<p>In light of Italy's surrender, many people speculate that today the United States and Britain will launch a landing operation on the Dalmatian coast, clearly coveting the Romanian oil fields. According to the views of the United States and Britain, in order to weaken Germany's ability to resist, it is necessary to seize any one of the three areas: the Ruhr industrial zone, southern Silesia, and the Romanian oil fields. In short, Romania's contribution to the German war economy is highly valued. Therefore, the Anglo-American air force dared to use large formations of 150 to 200 planes, flying back and forth 2,400 miles, to carry out the quite difficult Ploiesti bombing. It is said that the Anglo-American air force lost 56 planes at that time, about one-third of the total number of attacking aircraft. This illustrates how difficult it is to bomb the Romanian oil field area from current Anglo-American air bases.</p>
<p>Romania's Diplomacy</p>
<p>We should still remember that after the start of the European war, a fierce diplomatic battle was waged centered on these Romanian oil fields. In November 1939, the German-Romanian trade agreement was established, and Britain supplied Romania with aircraft to counter it.</p>
<p>In 1940, the Romanian government established a Petroleum Control Commission to control the oil produced. Britain and France issued warnings to the Romanian government not to supply oil from British and French companies to Germany, and cooperation between Germany and Romania gradually became closer.</p>
<p>At the end of June, the Soviet Union entered Bessarabia. Romania lost 17% of its territory and 3.5 million people.</p>
<p>On July 10, Romania clarified its attitude of cooperation with the Axis powers, issuing a notice denying the British and French declaration of April 10, 1939, regarding the guarantee of Romania. Afterwards, due to territorial issues, the domestic situation in Romania showed slight fluctuations. On September 6, Germany and Italy instructed Antonescu to demand that King Carol, who had pro-British and French leanings, abdicate, and Crown Prince Michael I ascended the throne. At the same time, the Antonescu cabinet was formed, and the great power of Romanian rule was entirely entrusted to General Antonescu. The king acknowledged by decree that Romania was a national and royal country of the Iron Guard.</p>
<p>The Romanian nationalistic system was thus completed. The opposing Communist Party launched demonstrations in Constanta, Bucharest, and other places. 100,000 German troops entered Romania to protect the oil resources. At this time, General Antonescu declared: "The entry of German troops is based on the request of the Romanian government, with the aim of rebuilding the Romanian army." The German side also announced that it would follow Romania's wishes, dispatch a military mission, and send a flying squadron to protect the country's oil fields.</p>
<p>The direct cause of the aforementioned major changes in Romania was the second territorial cession following the cession of Bessarabia. That is, according to the Vienna Award of Germany and Italy, Outer Transylvania was ceded to Hungary (August 30), and Southern Dobruja was ceded to Bulgaria. Due to these three territorial cessions, Romania lost nearly 40,000 square miles of territory and 4 million people.</p>
<p>However, General Antonescu's dictatorial regime smoothly overcame the domestic crisis. By promoting a policy of cooperation with Germany, the country was politically and economically stabilized. In November of the same year, it signed the Tripartite Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy, becoming a member of the Axis powers. The following year, on February 10, Anglo-Romanian relations were severed.</p>
<p>In June, the German-Soviet war broke out. Filled with the long-standing hatred of seizing Bessarabia, Romania gladly participated in the war against the Soviet Union, attacking Ukraine together with the German army. In addition to recapturing Bessarabia and Bukovina, it also occupied Odessa and the area up to the Dniester River, which was called Transnistria. Afterwards, the Romanian army continued to actively cooperate with the German army, fighting hard in Stalingrad. In the battles this summer, they withdrew from the Eastern Front to defend the Balkans.</p>
<p>Industry and Trade</p>
<p>Romania is the country with the most abundant resources among the Balkan states. About 70% of the residents are engaged in agriculture, making it a major agricultural country among the Danube countries. The main industry is petroleum. Before the war, it produced 8.7 million tons, ranking fourth in the world. Even now, it is said to produce as much as 6 million tons. Most of it is transported to Germany, making a great contribution to Germany's war effort.</p>
<p>In terms of trade, oil and grain account for an overwhelming proportion, making the country's trade a surplus. After the start of the European war, Germany's position as an exporting country greatly increased. In 1940, Greater Germany, including Czechoslovakia, accounted for 64.3% of the total in terms of imports and 49.3% in terms of exports. Recent statistics are unavailable, but trade with Germany has naturally increased further since breaking off relations with the anti-Axis powers.</p>
<p>Hungary</p>
<p>Since March 1920, when Admiral Miklós Horthy, the hero who overthrew the Bela Kun Red regime, was elected as regent by the National Assembly, he has consistently guided Hungary. His domestic situation has been closely integrated with the cooperation of Nazi Germany. Hungary declared itself the Kingdom of Hungary in 1921, but the throne was vacant. Regent Horthy became the dictator of Hungary, entrusted with full political power. Furthermore, according to the law of 1937, Regent Horthy was not responsible to the parliament. In February 1942, Nicholas Horthy resigned as regent due to old age, and his son Stephen Horthy served as regent's representative, but Stephen Horthy was killed while inspecting the German-Soviet war front, and old Horthy reassumed the regency.</p>
<p>Hungary is the country that had to endure the greatest sacrifices after the failure of the previous World War. Due to the Treaty of Trianon in June 1920, 70% of its territory and 63% of its population were forcibly divided among neighboring countries. The lost population included 460,000 people in Yugoslavia, 1 million in Czechoslovakia, and 1.6 million in Romania. Hungary attempted to restore this lost territory at every opportunity. Since the establishment of the Nazi regime, Germany has supported Hungary's demands and formed close diplomatic relations with it.</p>
<p>However, Hungary's long-standing desire to restore its lost territory was not achieved until the Munich Conference in October 1938. On November 2, the German and Italian foreign ministers held the Vienna Conference, which restored 4,200 square miles of territory in Czechia, with 700,000 Hungarians, 100,000 Slovaks, and 90,000 Ruthenians coming under its rule.</p>
<p>Hungary's second opportunity to recover lost territory came in June 1940, when the Soviet Union entered Bessarabia and pursued Romania. At this time, Hungary carried out large-scale preparatory mobilization on the Romanian border. Conflicts occurred between the Hungarian and Romanian armies. At the German-Italian-Hungarian talks on July 10, Hungary fulfilled its demand to recover lost territory in Romania. It was formally decided at the four-nation talks of Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Romania. As a result, Hungary recovered the northern half of Outer Transylvania, which it had lost in the Treaty of Trianon, from Romania.</p>
<p>On November 20 of the same year, Hungary signed the Tripartite Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy, legally confirming Hungary's attitude of cooperating with the Axis powers.</p>
<p>In February 1941, Hungary's third opportunity to recover lost territory came again. When Germany and Italy invaded Yugoslavia, Hungary advanced into the territory ceded to Yugoslavia in the Treaty of Trianon, gaining the triangular area between the Tisza and Danube rivers.</p>
<p>In this way, Hungary has been able to gradually restore the lost territory of the Treaty of Trianon through cooperation with Germany, so it is more pro-German than other Balkan countries. Recently, the indefinite postponement of the Diet session due to the anti-government attitude of the first party of Imre is also intended to further strengthen Hungary's current policy of cooperation with Germany.</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation with Germany</p>
<p>Dividing the small countries of Europe according to the Treaty of Versailles ignores the capitalist economic requirement for a wider trading area. The national economies of the small European countries, isolated by various customs barriers, are on the verge of crisis. Hungary is no exception, resulting in an unstable economy. However, thanks to the realistic financial policies of the Gömbös cabinet, it acquired Ruthenia, increasing its territory and population. In addition, the economic cooperation policy with Germany has revived Hungary. The outbreak of the European war in September 1939 caused grain prices to rise, creating a favorable base for Hungary.</p>
<p>However, the progress of the European war severed Hungary's relations with Britain and France, and the Hungarian economy became completely dependent on Germany. At the same time, restrictions were placed on the participation of Jews, who had traditionally dominated industry and commerce, in enterprises, so German capital was also given the opportunity to comprehensively enter enterprises. At the German-Hungarian Economic Agreement Council held in the last sentence of July 1941, Hungary's agriculture and consumer goods industry developed jointly by the two countries. It sought to exchange Hungarian light industrial products for German heavy industrial products. Furthermore, in the financial sector, it concluded an agreement with Germany to implement centralized economic calculations, whereby payments and settlements with Germany-dominated European countries were implemented through Berlin.

<h3>Major German-American Air Battle on the Baltic Coast; Main Force of German Warships Concentrated in Gdynia</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 11th: A squadron of U.S. Eighth Air Force bombers launched a large-scale air raid on the port of Gdynia on the Baltic coast at noon on the 9th. After receiving the news, the German fighter squadron immediately flew to intercept, and a fierce battle lasting several hours unfolded in the high altitude from Gotland to the Bay of Danzig. German Messerschmitt fighters shot down four U.S. bombers in just nine minutes after the engagement. Furthermore, when the U.S. Air Force approached the coastal area, German ground anti-aircraft artillery also fired in unison. As a result, 62 U.S. four-engine bombers were shot down. Assuming an average of ten crew members per plane, it can be seen that the U.S. military lost more than 600 pilots. It is generally believed that the U.S. military's long-range bombing of the Baltic coast was due to learning that the main force of the German fleet had gathered in the direction of the port of Gdynia. However, thanks to the brave interception by the German army, only the city streets and citizens of Anklam and Gotenhafen suffered minor damage. During the air battle, the German side also lost 11 fighters.</p>

<h3>Fierce German-Soviet Battles on the Plains of the Dnieper River; Unsettled Situation on the Southern Front</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: German and Soviet armies are engaged in fierce battles on the plains of Ukraine along the Dnieper River. The city of Kyiv is in imminent danger. It has been over two years since the elite troops under the command of Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau occupied the city on September 19, 1941, and raised the banner. Now the city is about to be engulfed in war again. Kyiv is located on the western bank of the middle reaches of the Dnieper River, on hills as high as 100 meters to as low as 30 meters, offering a panoramic view of the Ukrainian plains, with beautiful scenery. It is the oldest city in Russia, built by the Scythians before the Christian era, and the birthplace of Prince Vladimir. Around 882 AD, it was once the capital of the Russian Empire. There are many ancient ruins, the most famous of which is the Great Church of Saint Vladimir, built by Saint Vladimir the Great on the bank of the river. At the end of the 10th century, Saint Vladimir the Great converted the country to Greek Orthodoxy, so the city became the center of Russian religion. From the great fire of 1240, which burned more than 600 temples, one can imagine the grandeur of the time. Even today, there are still more than 80 Greek Orthodox temples in the city. Kyiv was occupied by Grand Duke Andrei Bogolyubsky in 1169, invaded by the Mongols in 1240, occupied by the Lithuanians in 1320, and once became Polish territory in 1567. Only after 1654 did it return to Russia. In modern times, Kyiv has become a modern city and is the intersection of the Moscow-Odessa-Kharkiv highway, making transportation very convenient. Before the war, the population was about 850,000. The city has universities, museums, opera houses, and other facilities. It is truly the center of culture in southern Russia. Since ancient times, it has been a distribution center for timber, grain, and leather. In recent years, factories manufacturing refined sugar and machinery have been the most prosperous.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 11th: According to a Haitong News report: After launching an offensive between the Sea of Azov and Melitopol on Saturday, the Soviet army launched an attack on the German bridgehead at Zaporozhye on Sunday. The enemy first bombarded with artillery, and the German artillery retaliated. According to news last night, the Soviet army's attacks on the strengthened German lines at Melitopol were repelled everywhere. Only one point was penetrated by the Soviet army, but it was surrounded by the German army, and the German lines at Melitopol remained intact. The situation between Melitopol and Zaporozhye is unstable. Newly arrived German forces captured a hill fought over by both sides and attacked the enemy behind the hill. In the middle reaches of the Dnieper River, the Soviet army is still trying to cross the river to establish a bridgehead on the west bank and expand the bridgeheads already established, but all attempts have been thwarted by concentrated German artillery fire. German counterattacks on the Pripet River continue to make progress, especially south of Chernobyl, where they have advanced significantly eastward.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Continues in the Nevel Area</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 11th: German News Agency: The focus of the Eastern Front war continues to be concentrated in the swampy area south of Velikiye Luki. A great pincer movement was carried out in this area in 1941. At that time, Timoshenko's forces suffered their greatest defeat. This time, the Soviet army plans to expand the gap it broke through in the German lines a few days ago, regardless of heavy losses. However, German light infantry have built strong fortifications on the flanks and a short distance from the breakthrough, preventing the Soviet army from passing through. There has been fighting all day on the northeast side of the Nevel bend. In order to resist the pressure of the Soviet army, the German army withdrew to a new position on the night of the 10th. However, the position was recaptured due to another German attack and fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>End of Fighting on the Taman Peninsula</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th: Since February of this year, the German army has firmly defended the Kuban bridgehead, repelling the stubborn offensive of the Soviet forces for more than nine months, allowing the German army in other theaters to operate smoothly. Now that the German army's combat objective has been fully achieved, it withdrew from the entire area of the Kuban bridgehead on October 8.</p>
<h3>German Troops in Eastern Italy Retreat Northwest; Landing Anti-Axis Forces Attacked</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th: Anti-Axis forces landed a strong force in Termoli in eastern Italy under the cover of cruisers and destroyers. The German army engaged them and has retreated northwest.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th</p>
<p>According to a Haitong News report: It took the main force on the left flank of the U.S. Fifth Army five days to reach the Volturno River after the Anti-Axis forces occupied Naples, which shows the slow progress of the enemy army and the smooth resistance of the German army. Although the enemy army has reached Capua on the riverbank, it is still only engaged in local probing battles and has not built any bridgeheads on the north bank. East of Capua in the Apennine Mountains, attacks by the Axis forces were also repelled. In the center, south of Port d'Olfo, north of Caserta, the U.S. Fifth Army has intensified its efforts, but must increase resistance. In the eastern region, a large number of enemy troops landed under the cover of several warships, and the bridgehead northwest of Termoli was expanded. The German army's left flank has retreated slightly, but apart from heavy artillery bombardments, the enemy army has not made any progress. The British Eighth Army suffered heavy losses in the battle on the line between [unclear] and [unclear]. In general, although the enemy army is intensifying its activities on the southern Italian front, there is no sign that a major battle has already begun.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Registration Implemented in Nine Cities Including Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou; Local Materials Investigation Committees Organized</h3>
<p>Nanjing, October 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: In order to suppress commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government has promulgated emergency economic policies for wartime and is gradually implementing control over various major commodities. Among these, rice is essential for people's sustenance, so a special department was established early on to take charge of unified allocation and supply. Cotton yarn and cloth are also closely related to people's livelihoods among major commodities. Therefore, the control of these commodities in the Shanghai area has been actively implemented since mid-August of this year under the clear orders of the National Government. Since its implementation, it has achieved the expected success in suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. It is now known that in order to ascertain the quantity of cotton yarn and cloth in major cities other than Shanghai, the Executive Yuan has designated nine cities, including Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Bengbu, to conduct investigation and registration. The organizational regulations for the Local Materials Investigation Committee were officially announced on the 12th to facilitate the separate establishment of committees for strict investigation. Minister of Industry Chen Junpu specially emphasized the government's intentions and hoped that merchants and civilians would appreciate the government's sincere efforts to implement wartime economic policies and promptly and truthfully declare their registration, so as to achieve the fundamental purpose of stabilizing people's livelihoods. The following are Minister Chen's remarks and the organizational regulations for the Local Materials Investigation Committee:</p>
<p>Minister Chen Discusses the Significance of Registration</p>
<p>Minister of Industry Chen made the following remarks regarding the handling of cotton yarn and cloth registration and investigation in major cities other than Shanghai: The National Government, in order to suppress commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, has had no choice but to gradually implement control over various major commodities. Among the major commodities, cotton yarn and cloth are most closely related to people's livelihoods. Therefore, the control of these two commodities in the Shanghai area has long been clearly ordered for active implementation. The quantity of cotton yarn and cloth in major cities other than Shanghai should also be continuously investigated and clarified. The Executive Yuan has now designated nine cities, including Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Nantong, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Wuhu, to handle cotton yarn and cloth registration and investigation. The registration is being actively handled by the responsible government agencies in the aforementioned locations in accordance with the Ministry of Industry's regulations for the registration of major commodities. At the beginning of the implementation, it is inevitable that a small number of merchants and civilians will adopt a wait-and-see attitude and intentionally conceal information. In order to prevent such malpractices, the Executive Yuan has specially announced the organizational regulations for the Local Materials Investigation Committee to facilitate the separate establishment of committees for strict investigation. If concealment is discovered, severe punishment will be imposed in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Regulations for Punishing Hoarding of Essential Commodities, without any leniency. It is hoped that the merchants and civilians in the aforementioned locations will appreciate the government's sincere efforts to promote wartime economic strategies and promptly and truthfully apply for registration. At the same time, it is hoped that those handling the investigation will be considerate of the difficulties faced by merchants and handle matters impartially, so as to fulfill the fundamental purpose of stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>

<p>Minister Horiuchi Issues Statement</p>
<p>Nanjing, October 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Japanese Minister Horiuchi recently issued a statement regarding the registration and investigation of cotton yarn and cloth in major cities other than Shanghai, stating that the Chinese National Government, in order to suppress commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, had previously implemented the registration, investigation, and purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai. This time, it has been decided to implement the registration of cotton yarn and cloth in nine cities, including Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Nantong, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Wuhu. In addition to implementing the registration in accordance with the Regulations for the Registration of Major Commodities, the Executive Yuan also promulgated the Organizational Regulations for the Local Materials Investigation Committee on October 12th to facilitate the formation of committees in various localities to supervise and promote the investigation of cotton yarn and cloth, with the aim of achieving perfection. As with Shanghai, Japanese members will participate in the investigation committee, which is a joint organization. The Japanese side will fully cooperate with the registration and investigation. In this regard, it is hoped that Japanese operators will take the lead in demonstrating fair registration and obey the investigation, so that the economic control under the Greater East Asia War can be perfected.</p>

<h3>Central Government Sells National Day Commemorative Items; Chairman Wang Issues Instructions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, October 10th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Today is the National Day of the Republic of China, the 32nd year. The entire nation, in light of the National Government's participation in the war, the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights by friendly nations, and the completion of independence, as well as the establishment of a solid foundation for victory in the Greater East Asia War, is celebrating this National Day with encouragement and joy. In addition to universally displaying flags to commemorate the occasion, celebrations are also being held separately in various locations. At 9:00 AM this morning, the central government held a grand celebration ceremony in the National Government Auditorium. Chairman Wang and the heads of various ministries, departments, and offices attended. Civilian officials wore new national formal attire or blue gowns, while military officials were fully armed. At 9:00 AM sharp, the solemn ceremony began amidst resounding music. The heads of the various ministries took their seats, the Chairman took his place, and the rituals were performed as prescribed. The Chairman then delivered instructions, providing a pertinent exposition on the significance of this year's National Day celebration, reviewing the past, and encouraging the future. The entire assembly listened respectfully and felt unusually inspired. After the instructions, the heads of the various ministries and departments bowed to the Chairman in congratulation.

The President of the Judicial Yuan then led the heads of the various ministries and departments in chanting "Long live the Chairman." The solemn celebration concluded at 10:00 AM.</p>

<h3>Economy Strengthens After Material Control</h3>
<p>Nanjing, October 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: In order to investigate the hoarding of materials, the National Government established the Materials Investigation Committee. It has strictly investigated and handled the illegal hoarding of large quantities of major materials by merchants and civilians in Shanghai, with significant results. In particular, after the investigation of cotton yarn and cloth, which are closely related to people's livelihoods, strict controls were implemented, allowing supply and demand to be smoothly balanced, which greatly benefited wartime economic policies. However, it is difficult to establish an overall wartime economic system if only the Shanghai area implements this control policy. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has promulgated the Organizational Regulations for the Local Materials Investigation Committee, which will immediately begin strict investigations separately to ensure that the storage of major materials in important cities is accurately quantified in order to implement thorough control. It is widely believed that after the concrete implementation of this system, the wartime national economic system will be further strengthened, and the lives of the people will gradually stabilize. Thus, the national strength will become stronger. There is no doubt that it will be able to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War and establishing the co-prosperity of East Asia as a whole. However, based on past experience, some merchants and civilians may underestimate this policy, focusing only on their own selfish interests and disregarding national laws and regulations. It is hoped that the authorities will not be lenient and will severely punish them, so that the cunning and stubborn will disappear. The establishment of a wartime economic system and the early realization of its success are what the people desire.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army in North China Operates Very Smoothly; Many Guerrilla Bases in Western Hebei Swept Away</h3>
<p>Beijing, October 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese army in North China believes that the Communist bandits are an obstacle to the construction of North China. Therefore, they often carry out suppression operations against them. Since mid-September, they have launched autumn anti-communist battles in various parts of North China. The operations are progressing very smoothly. As of the 5th of this month, they have achieved great results. They have killed and captured more than 13,300 communist soldiers. The Japanese army is currently engaged in a fierce offensive. According to the announcement of the results of the war released by the Japanese army authorities in North China at 4:00 PM on the 11th, 347 communist facilities were destroyed, including munitions factories, mine factories, munitions warehouses, clothing factories, flour mills, granaries, printing houses, and barracks. 8,757 communist corpses were counted, and 4,517 people were captured.

<p>A Certain Base on the Western Hebei Front, October 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: In order to thoroughly destroy the Communist army of the Western Hebei Military Region under Nie Rongzhen, the Japanese army launched a vigorous offensive. One unit marched south from a certain place, crossed Chajian Ridge on September 17th, passed Daomaguan on the 19th, broke through the landmine zone laid by the bandits, and advanced on Mazhuang on the 21st. Another unit advanced west from Yinfang on the 19th and met at Daomaguan before approaching the headquarters of the First Military Sub-District of the bandits at Shenxiandao. Another elite Japanese unit, departing from a certain place on the 16th and 19th, swept away the bandits in the Shangzan Township and Tianbaidao area and forced their way to Shenxiandao, completing the encirclement. Responding to each other, they began a fierce offensive. The Communist bandits resisted stubbornly but were ultimately defeated under the brave and fierce offensive of the Japanese army. The Japanese army then took the opportunity to break into the Shenxiandao Communist base on the 24th, annihilating it and thoroughly destroying the military facilities scattered in the area. Having achieved their objectives, the Japanese army turned its sharp edge to conduct a fierce sweep of the First and Second Military Sub-Districts of the Communist Hebei Military Region and the Yanbei Command. It is currently ongoing. Furthermore, other Japanese units, in close coordination with neighboring units, launched a fierce offensive on the 28th against the bandits of the Third Military Sub-District east and west of Pingyang (approximately 16 kilometers west of Lingqiu Town), breaking through the center of the bandit forces. Another Japanese unit moved to the west and defeated the bandits in Cangcun (approximately 50 kilometers northwest of Hengshan Town). Another unit seized the mountainous area on the left bank of the Nanyang River on October 1st. Another unit pursued bandits lurking 15 kilometers west of Chenhua. Another unit drove away a unit of bandits from Liuyuan Village (5 kilometers north of Chenzhuang) at dawn on September 17th and broke into Nanmobacun, 7 kilometers northwest of Chenzhuang. On the other hand, a certain new elite Japanese unit suddenly launched an offensive from the Beijing-Hankou Railway line. On September 17th, they broke through the mountain blockade line and launched encirclement battles everywhere in the northwest of Koutou Town (20 kilometers northwest of Xingtang). Several units searched for the 35th Division of the bandits in the upper reaches of the Wenbu River. In early September, they captured bandits near Wendu (approximately 7 kilometers west of Guosuo Town) on the Zhao River and wiped out their facilities.</p>
<p>Purging Near Hankou</p>

<h3>Three-Nation Conference Scheduled for Next Week</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, October 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The German News Agency, quoting a London dispatch from the Stockholm Daily News, said that the Three-Nation Conference, which has been discussed for many days, may be held in Moscow on the 17th of this month and will close at the end of this month. The Soviet Union will gain a psychological advantage because the conference will be held on Soviet territory.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, October 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Reuters dispatch: A Swedish newspaper reporter stationed in London published an article reviewing the future Moscow conference, stating briefly that British and American personnel believe that Britain and the United States may accept the demands of the Soviet Union. The British Observer believes that there is a good possibility that the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, will establish a common policy, and the Polish question can also be resolved. London understands that the Soviet Union is in an advantageous psychological position because the location of the conference is filled with the joyful atmosphere of victory. However, it is hoped that the Soviet Union will understand the interests of the common front against Germany. A Swedish newspaper reporter stationed in New York even predicted that the United States would make complete concessions, because well-informed people in the United States believe that a surprising event may occur in Moscow. There is no longer disagreement on the measures necessary for the security of various countries. The security issue will be in a very important position at the Moscow conference. Various countries rejected the Soviet Union's territorial demands, but the United States is willing to abandon its views in order to achieve complete understanding with the Soviet Union. Although the United States wants to assist Finland and the Baltic countries, the division of borders may emphasize reality over ideals, and the consideration of annual needs may outweigh the consideration of the rights of small and respected nations.</p>

<h3>Baltic Sea German-American Air Battle</h3>
<p>German Fleet Main Force Concentrates in Gdynia</p>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency: The U.S. Eighth Air Force bomber squadron launched a large-scale air raid on the port of Gdynia on the Baltic coast on the 9th. After receiving the news, the German fighter squadron immediately flew to intercept them, resulting in a fierce battle that lasted for several hours in the high altitude from Gotland to the Bay of Danzig.  The German Messerschmitts shot down four U.S. bombers within just nine minutes of engagement. Furthermore, as the U.S. Air Force approached the coastal area, German ground anti-aircraft artillery units also unleashed a barrage of shells, resulting in the downing of sixty-two U.S. four-engine bombers.  With an average of ten crew members per aircraft, it is estimated that the U.S. military suffered casualties of over six hundred airmen.  It is generally believed that the U.S. military's long-range bombing of the Baltic coast was likely due to information that the main force of the German fleet had concentrated in the Gdynia port area. However, thanks to the courageous interception by the German forces, only the city streets and residents of Angermünde and Gotenhafen suffered minor damage. In the air battle, the German side also lost twelve fighter planes.</p>

<h3>The European War and the Balkan States (3)</h3>
<p>Romania</p>
<p>If it is said that the strategic goal of the anti-Axis countries in the Balkans is Bulgaria, then the primary target of the enemy's military attacks is Romania.</p>
<p>Given Italy's surrender, many observers believe that the Anglo-Americans will launch an amphibious landing in the Dalmatian Sea. This is naturally aimed at the Romanian oil fields. From the Anglo-American perspective, in order to weaken Germany's war effort, it is necessary to seize any of the following three areas: the Ruhr industrial area, southern Silesia, and the Romanian oil fields. In short, Romania's role in the German war economy is highly valued. Therefore, the Anglo-American air force dares to use large formations of 150 to 200 aircraft, flying back and forth 2,400 miles to carry out difficult bombing runs. It is said that the Anglo-American air force has lost 56 aircraft, approximately one-third of the total number of aircraft that attacked. This demonstrates how difficult it is to bomb the Romanian oil field region from the current Anglo-American airbases.</p>
<p>Romanian Diplomacy</p>
<p>One Week After the Start of the European War</p>
<p>We should remember the intense diplomatic war that revolved around these Romanian oil fields. In November 1939, the German-Romanian trade agreement was concluded, and Britain supplied Romania with aircraft to counter it.</p>
<p>In 1940, the Romanian government established a Petroleum Control Commission to control the oil produced. The British and French warned the Romanian government not to supply German with oil from British and French affiliated companies, and the cooperation between Germany and Romania gradually became closer.</p>
<p>At the end of June, the Soviet Union moved into Bessarabia, and Romania lost 17% of its territory, with a population of 3.5 million, in Prahova.</p>
<p>On July 10, Romania clarified its cooperative attitude toward the Axis powers and issued a notice denying the Anglo-French declaration of April 10, 1939 regarding the guarantee of Romania's integrity. Subsequently, due to territorial issues, Romania's domestic situation showed signs of instability. On September 6, the Germans and Italians instructed Antonescu to demand the abdication of King Carol, who had pro-British and pro-French leanings, and Crown Prince Michael I ascended the throne. At the same time, the Antonescu cabinet was formed, and the great power of Romanian rule was delegated to General Antonescu. The king recognized Romania as a national democratic state of the Iron Guard by edict.</p>
<p>The Romanian nationalist system was thus completed. The opposition Communist Party launched demonstrations in Constanta, Bucharest, and other places. 100,000 German troops moved into Romania to protect oil resources. At this time, General Antonescu declared that the German troops' entry was based on the Romanian government's request and was for the purpose of rebuilding the Romanian army. The German side also announced that it would dispatch a military mission in accordance with Romania's wishes and send a flight squadron to protect the country's oil fields.</p>
<p>The direct cause of the above-mentioned great change in Romania was the second territorial seizure following the seizure of Bessarabia. That is, according to the Vienna Award by Germany and Italy, Outer Transylvania was ceded to Hungary (August 30), and Southern Dobruja was ceded to Bulgaria. Due to these three territorial cessions, Romania lost nearly 40,000 square miles of territory and a population of 4 million.</p>
<p>However, General Antonescu's autocratic regime smoothly overcame the domestic turmoil. Due to the promotion of a policy of cooperation with Germany, the country became stable politically and economically. In November of the same year, it signed the Tripartite Pact joining Japan, Germany, and Italy, becoming a member of the Axis powers. On February 10 of the following year, Anglo-Romanian relations were severed.</p>
<p>In June, the German-Soviet war broke out. Filled with the long-held grudge of seizing Bessarabia, Romania gladly participated in the war against the Soviet Union and attacked Ukraine with the German army. In addition to retaking Bessarabia and Bukovina, it also occupied Odessa and the area up to the Dniester River, calling it Outer Transnistria. After that, the Romanian army continued to actively cooperate with the German army, fighting bravely at Stalingrad. In this summer's war, they retreated from the Eastern Front to defend the Balkans.</p>
<p>Industry and Trade</p>
<p>Romania is the most resource-rich country in the Balkans. About 70% of the population is engaged in agriculture, making it a major agricultural producer among the Danube countries. The main industry is petroleum. Before the war, it produced 8.7 million tons, accounting for the fourth largest in the world. Even now, it is said to produce as much as 6 million tons. Most of it is sent to Germany, making a great contribution to Germany's war effort.</p>
<p>In terms of trade, oil and grains account for an overwhelming proportion, making the country's trade surplus. The position of Germany as an exporter greatly increased after the outbreak of war in Europe. In 1940, Greater Germany, including Czechoslovakia, accounted for 64.3% of total imports and 49.3% of exports. Recent statistics are not available, but trade with Germany has naturally increased since the severing of relations with the anti-Axis countries.</p>
<p>Hungary</p>
<p>Since March 1920, when Admiral Horthy, the hero who overthrew the Bela Kun red regime, was recommended as regent by the National Assembly, he has consistently led Hungary, and its domestic situation has been closely linked to cooperation with Nazi Germany. Hungary declared itself the Kingdom of Hungary in 1921, but the throne was left vacant, and Regent Horthy became the dictator of Hungary, entrusted with full political power. Furthermore, according to the law of 1937, Regent Horthy was not even responsible to the parliament. In February 1942, Nicholas Horthy was elderly...? As regent, his son Stephen Horthy served as the regent's representative, but Stephen Horthy was killed in action while inspecting the German-Soviet front. The elder Horthy resumed his role as regent.</p>
<p>Hungary is a country that had to endure the greatest sacrifices after the failure of the previous world war. Due to the Treaty of Trianon in June 1920, 70% of the...? Land and 63% of the population were forcibly divided among neighboring countries. The lost population included 460,000 people in Yugoslavia, 1 million in Czechoslovakia, and 1.6 million in Romania. Every time Hungary had the opportunity, it attempted to recover these lost territories. Since the establishment of the Nazi regime, Germany has supported Hungary's demands and formed close diplomatic relations with it.</p>
<p>However, Hungary's long-held desire to recover its lost territories was not achieved until after the Munich Conference in October 1938. On November 2, the German and Italian foreign ministers held the Vienna Conference, where 4,200 square miles of territory were recovered from Czechoslovakia, with 700,000 Hungarians, 100,000 Slovaks, and 90,000 Ruthenians coming under its rule.</p>
<p>Hungary's second opportunity to recover lost territories came in June 1940, when the Soviet Union moved into Bessarabia and pursued Romania. At this time, Hungary implemented a large-scale mobilization on the Romanian border. Conflicts occurred between the Hungarian and Romanian armies. At the Tripartite Talks between Germany, Italy and Hungary on July 10, Hungary succeeded in recovering the lost territories from Romania. What was formally decided was the four-nation talks between Germany, Italy, Hungary and Romania. As a result, Hungary recovered the northern half of the Outer Transylvania region from Romania, which had been lost in the Treaty of Trianon.</p>
<p>In November of the same year, on November 20, Hungary signed and acceded to the Tripartite Pact among Japan, Germany and Italy. Hungary's attitude of cooperating with the Axis powers was legally confirmed.</p>
<p>In February 1941, Hungary's third opportunity to recover lost territories came. When Germany and Italy invaded Yugoslavia, Hungary advanced into the territory that had been ceded to Yugoslavia by the Treaty of Trianon, gaining the triangular area between the Tisza and Danube rivers.</p>
<p>In this way, Hungary was able to gradually recover the lost territories of the Treaty of Trianon by cooperating with Germany, so the pro-German sentiment was stronger than in other Balkan countries. Recently, the parliament has indefinitely postponed its session due to the anti-government attitude of Imre the First, in order to further strengthen the current Hungarian policy of cooperation with Germany.</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation with Germany</p>
<p>The division of small European countries according to the Treaty of Versailles ignored the capitalist economic law that demands a wider trading circle. The national economies of small European countries, isolated by various customs barriers, were on the verge of crisis, and Hungary was no exception, creating economic...? In recent years. Due to the pragmatic pro...? Policy of the...? Cabinet, it obtained Lodnia and increased its territory and population. In addition to the policy of economic cooperation with Germany, the Hungarian economy has been revived. The outbreak of the European War in September 1939 caused grain prices to rise, creating a favorable situation for Hungary.</p>
<p>However, the progress of the European War led to the severing of relations between Hungary and Britain and France, and the Hungarian economy became completely dependent on Germany. At the same time, the establishment of restrictions on the participation of Jews who had traditionally dominated industry and commerce in enterprises gave German capital a chance to advance comprehensively. At the German-Hungarian Economic Agreement held in late July 1941, Hungarian agriculture and consumer goods industry were developed jointly by the two countries. To exchange Hungarian light industrial products with German heavy industrial products, and in the financial sector, it concluded a mid-term settlement agreement with Germany, in which payments and settlements with Germany-dominated European countries were implemented through Berlin.
