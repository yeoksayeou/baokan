<p>社評</p>
<h3>戰時事業心的表現</h3>
<p>從前有一個時期，美國製帽工業因相互競爭，無計劃生產而陷於循環生滅的悲劇。因為彼時多數資本家咸集注於製帽工業必能獲利，遂各不相謀，同時成立多數的製帽工廠，加速生產。繼則因生產過剩，而銷路停滯；復因銷路停滯而削價競賣，減少工資，裁退工人，工廠終於無法雜持，而同歸於盡。數年之後，帽子又感缺乏，而新的競爭又應時而興。形成循環相生相滅的局面。</p>
<p>這些美國資本家經營製帽工業，不能不說是從事事業，他們之間相互競爭，加速生產，又不能不說是表現事業心。可是，其結果因生產過剩，銷路停滯而同歸於盡，那末，豈非害於「事業心」呢？其實則不然，經營製帽工業，確是從事事業：相互競爭，加速生產，也確是事業心的表現，而其失敗，是由於「事業心」的未曾完備而已！</p>
<p>完備的事業心，必須對於事業的成功，有百折不回的爭取精神；對於事業的目的，有利己利人利社會利國家的志願；對於事業的理想，有垂之永久的抱負；對於事業的環境，有隨時適應保持生存的方法</p>
<p>美國資本家無計劃的製帽工業，雖已具事業心從事經營，但他們的目的，僅是利已；他們的理想，僅是眼前獲得巨利；他們對於環境，更不能隨時適應。大家只知相互競爭於眼前獲致巨利，不考慮因生產過剩而同歸於盡的未來環境；同時，旣已遭遇到初期銷路停滯的環境，又未能彼此之間共同商討適應方法，保持生存；而推演所屆，同歸於盡。所以，我們說失敗是由於」事業心「的未曾完備。</p>
<p>當然，如上所舉「完備的事業心」，是不很容易做到的事。可是，為了個人事業的成功，社會事業的成以，國家事業的成功，每一個人都應該懸此「完備的事業心」以自期。事　的範圍至廣至大，無論士農工商以至服官行善，都是事業，也可以說每一個人都有其事業，絕不是辦工廠組公司才算事業。</p>
<p>我們有一句諺語，叫做：「前人種樹，後人乘涼。」這句話，如以積極解釋，更可以喻為「事業心」的精神。因為要便利後人的乘凉，就得自我種樹。這就是抱負利人的目的；抱負垂之永久的理想，是完備的事業心。晚淸時期，左宗棠氏出任陝甘總督，為荒漠區域水利着想，栽植柳樹，至今稱便，當地人民感念功續，稱為左公柳。左氏就是「完備事業心」表現的一例。</p>
<p>不過，上面這一句諺語，如以消極的解釋，很足以為時下一般人事業心的寫照，因為徒然便於後人乘凉，我又何必辛辛苦苦去種樹呢？存了這樣的觀念，對於事業的目的完全基於利已的慾望，就是抱負垂之永久的理想，也不外乎為子孫打算。就備人觀點，事業縱是成功，而就社會與國家觀點，畢竟是失敗的。</p>
<p>一切事業，在平時固已需要事業心的表現，在戰時，尤其需要事業心的表現，一切都以國家利益為前提，個人利益與國家利益衝突時，應絕對放棄個人利益。　如新近成立的米糧統制委員會，是戰時為人民服務的事業，觀於該會組織的龐大，人事的繁複，當然，每個工作人員尤其負責當局，都需表現事業心。第一要有百折不回爭取成功的精神；第二要有利人民利國家的抱負；第三要有種之亦久的功績；第西要有隨時適應環境的方法。</p>
<p>我們並以至誠，提供「事業心」以自勉勉人，尤其盼望政治領袖，社會領袖，實業界領袖等等食有領導責任，發生模範作用者，格外重視之，戰時胃家事業與社會事業的成就，實利賴之！</p>
<h3>日緬兩國新條約　在仰光正式簽訂　撣部卡累尼各州劃入緬領</h3>
<p>仰光二十六日中央社電　緬甸自八月一日宣吿獨立後，即決定建國基本政策，本此政策向遂行戰爭與建設之途，并積極强化國內戰時體制，鞏固獨立國家之地位。今日緬兩國問復於二十五日在仰光締結新條約，根據此條約，將　部及卡累尼兩州并瓦地方劃歸緬領，按以上之地區，面積約當緬甸本國領土三分之一，於茲新緬旬國之威容更陸加强。此新協定於是日下午四時三十分，在緬甸政府大禮堂由緬甸總理巴英與日駐緬澤田大使正式簽宇　參加此典禮者，緬方計到有副總理達金米亞，外長　鋅奴曁樞密院正副總裁以及　部卡累尼兩州土人代表，日方計有島津總領事，農村中堂陸海軍武官及大使館館員，簽字畢，并由澤田大使致詞，巴莫總理致答詞，旋即禮成，因之撞部州卡累　州及瓦地方即根據此條約於本年中廢除軍政，而歸屬於緬甸政府直轄，因此緬甸國得編入四萬六千九白五十平方哩之領土，緬　獨立當時之領土面積為十七萬一千一百五十七平方哩，此三地編入後，巳增為二十一萬八千一百零七百平方哩，南北最農為一千三百哩，東西為　戶哩，其領土之面　在共榮圈國家內佔第四位，人口前為一千五自餘萬，現加入新歸併之領土，居民已北　一千六百六十萬左有。按此次　部之編入緬領，實具有下列數項重要之意義：　新領土自英國征服緬甸後，已有五十餘年，與緬甸完全分離，於今　人緬領　，始東行合併。　揮部州擁有礦產及木村　重要資源，今編入緬領後，將於經濟方面增强緬甸之國力，且對於共榮國之　　發展上，亦多裨益。　　部人及卡累尼人歸人緬甸後，緬甸建國精神　稱揚之民族　和已　成所期之條件，同時州　巴莫總理前發表之緬甸基本國策，得使確立國家總動員之基礎更加强化，於軍事方面，使對北方之渝軍完成地理上之緬甸防衛體勢，由於緬甸之民族結合及國民精神之　揚與日本及各盟邦之提携，使緬甸之決戰態勞，因此巳入於決定階段。</p>
<h3>澤田大使　慶賀之詞</h3>
<p>仰光二十六日中央社電　日駐緬甸澤的大　，於日　條約簽字後，向緬甸國家代表巴莫總理致詞稱：日緬兩國此次訂結條約，將（景東州孟班州除外）　部各州並瓦地方等訓入緬甸國領土，該條約業由緬甸國內閣總理巴莫閣下興木大使簽署完畢，本日為緬甸慶祝獨立　禮之日，適有此意義深長之條約簽署，可謂許天同慶，對此條約乃日木依据肇國大理想，以解放東亞典建設世界新秩序為目標之道義政策之一種表現。日木爲完成緬甸獨立，不惟予以一切協力興支援，簽署此條約。即係本諸此精神，緬甸國於已往半世紀問在英國之統治下，因受民族不和政策所禍，致毒害國家，今訓入新領土後，緬甸各民族巳成　然一體，此舉對於緬甸之獨立可謂錦上添花，實堪慶賀也。故本條約實乃增進日緬兩國團結之樞紐，深冀兩國今後益加相互提灣，為完遂共同戰爭而淬　邁進。</p>
<h3>蘇聯戰力的分析（一）　譯自同盟世界週報　一二二三號</h3>
<p>引言</p>
<p>在戰央上堪稱空前的歷時二年的德蘇之戰，現巳進入緊要關頭。去年十一月卞九日開始的蘇軍第二次冬季反攻，在兵員，器械上雖大受損失，但蘇軍幾全部奪囘了去年夏季的德軍大攻勢所喪失的地域。而且其間更有「斯達林格勒之熱劇」點綴着，使德國　正地覺得有從勳新檢討蘇聯戰力的必要。德國宣傳部長戈培爾博士最近為某報撰文說：「當時德國在近於絕望的狀態。蘇聯進攻德國本土之秋，不是迫於眉睫嗎！我們都深圳地覺得有這印象。一他率直地承認德國在冬季戰中陷於空也的重大危機中。</p>
<p>從夏季到冬季</p>
<p>但希等勒之英勇果斷的作戰發効了，德蘇冬季戰之水年三月末暫告段據，德國的戰　又吿穩定、之後德蘇二軍間進行着局部的陳地爭奮戰，德軍當局雖再三警告蘇軍的所謂「夏季攻勢」即將開始，但中立　方面、甚至於英美二國的觀測，都以為在冬季反攻中兵員器械均受重大損失的蘇軍，打破一向的慣例，自行開始夏季攻勢，是不可能的，</p>
<p>事實上德蘇戰是一種拉鋸戰，在夏季，德軍取攻勢，在冬季，蘇聯反攻，因為有以前的道種觀念，故不以蘇軍打破這拉鋸的均街而開始所謂夏季攻勢。</p>
<p>蘇打破均勢</p>
<p>關於蘇軍的戰力，前而已經脫過德國亟須重加檢討，但七月五日拂曉開始的蘇軍的攻勢，即在反軸心陳綫內，亦迫切地覺得把蘇聯的抗戰力再予估價的必要。總而言之，蘇軍打破以前均勢，在夏季也開始攻勞的事實，實有關心的價値。　如戰史所說，不問近投戰的方式如何，取攻勢的一方，即確保戰局的主動的一方，當占有利的地位。</p>
<p>德蘇夏季戰開始以來，數月於茲，總統大本營的連日公報稱，蘇軍在兵力，器械上所眾的損害極大，但終究被奪囘了奧眾爾，貝爾格洛特，普里安斯克，卡料夫，其銳鋒殊難阻擋，更對中部戰綫最衝要的斯摩　斯克，展開包圍戰，亦爲德軍視為堪慮的一件事。</p>
<p>重心仍在東綫</p>
<p>在反軸心朱曾開關歐　第二戰綫的今日，東部戰綫在德軍依然不失主惡戰綫的地位。縱令區的開　了歡洲第二戰綫，德軍不能不推行二面作戰　東都戰綫也依然為主要戰綫，具有決定的影響。</p>
<p>茲試從軍事，政治，外交三方面依次檢討蘇聯的動向。不用說，蘇聯的動向，　蘇聯戰力所左右·幾不可能。茲僅提出本質方面加以檢討。</p>
<h3>農具實騐廠　昨行開幕禮　陳廠長新臨致詞</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　國民政府為增加生產，改良農耕按術起見，在無錫設立農具製造實騐　，由實業部長陳君　氏一兼任廠長。經數月來之籌備，　巳開始製造各種新式農是，幷於二十六日舉行閉幕典禮，陳兼廠長　自出席致詞。出席者有中日重要長官，及上海金融實業界代表共二百餘人，典禮於下午三時在該廠大禮堂開始，由中日各長官分別致詞，語多　羣　勵，至下午六時始行　成，情况至為熱烈。</p>
<p>科學管理</p>
<p>又據記者探悉，該廢佔地三十西畝，技工數百人，一切工程之推進，技工之管理，純用科學方法。此中對於技工福利之設施，極　週密，幷籌訓設立技工訓練班，從事技工習識　灌輸，藉以集成建設新中國之基本建設人材，此外并有極完善之機械設備，目前已製有成品多種。</p>
<h3>巴莫代表　答謝援助</h3>
<p>仰光二十六日中央社電日緬領土條約簽字時，緬甸國家代表巴莫致答詞，其大意謂，日緬兩國今日如訂領土條約，規定將　部(景東及孟班　外）及卡累尼州並瓦地方　入緬領，此不僅裨益緬甸之團結，且對東亞　秩序及東亞共槃圈西方地域之强化，定有莫大買獻，日緬兩國及東亞各國間之團結，必將因此吏趨緊密，揮贛卡累尼各州及瓦地方多屬緬甸，為構成緬甸之主要部份，但因英緬戰爭緬甸失收，被迫割予英國，英國之統制各州毫無顧及其福社及利權，一切手段極盡挑撥之能事，英國為伸張其勢力，極力防害谷州之發展此種汚點於今因承日本之好意接助，得以洗除，吾人對此深為感激。揮部，卡累尼及瓦地方，今巳根據國家共同之命運，盡其應盡之義務，余確信吾人在一個命令，一個聲音之下，萬結一致，始能　得最後勝利。</p>
<h3>日緬簽訂　條約全文</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日，緬領土條約，已於二十五日簽訂，其全文如次：日本帝國政府及緬甸國政府為謀兩國緊密協力，完成對英美兩國之共同戰爭及基於道義之大東亞建設起見，以雙方之決意協定如左：第一條，日本國承認緬甸國將揮部諸州(惟景束及孟班除外），卡聚尼諸州及瓦地方編入緬甸領土，第二條，日本國自本條約實施之日起，於九十日內取消現在前條規定各地域內所實施之行政，第三條，實施木條約所必要之細目，應由兩國官憲之間協議決定之，第四條，本條終自簽訂日起實施。</p>
<h3>全國警政會議　昨圓滿閉幕　大會發表宣言</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　警政會議於二十六日　續舉行第三　大會，首由秘書長報吿出度會員人數，次宣讀第二次大會紀錄。討論事項為討論廿五日審查委員各組審查之案件，關於經費類計四　，業務類十三案，其他類之案件七案，均經決議原則通過，分別由內政部統　辦理，並酌予　止，大會討論畢，即於上午十一時舉行開幕式，由議長陳部長，副議長王次長，秘　長倪家　主持，茲將大會宣言錄後：</p>
<p>大會宣言</p>
<p>本屆全周警政會議，由於中央政府力求適應戰時體制，增進警政敎能，確保地方冶安之動機而召集。當此協力大東亞　戰必勝期問，則本會議所具之重要性，誠無與倫比。</p>
<p>夷考一國內政之良窳，恒先須視其警察是否能盡其職責以為衡。今則時勢緊迫，且以吾國百年來備受英美緊迫，國蹙民貧。事變數年，幸賴最高領袖汪主席倡導和平，還都建國。白大束亞戰爭發生以後，實　參戰，與友我日本國力以　求永久之解放。此時鞏固後方，實為最大之任務，警察所負當前艱鉅之使命，責無當貸。故在戰時召集　政會議，巳不僅屬於內政良盡問題、乃　係整個國家整個東亞安危之樞紐。</p>
<p>大會議於三十二年九月二十四日，由內政部召集，所有出席與議人員，均爲各省市辦理警務高級負　者，除能體會中央之意旨。就經騐學識之所得，各抒所見，製成雜案，均屬切合時代需要＃將來逐案施行，自可完成參戰　大使命，此堪告慰全國</p>
<p>對於東亞總力戰所具必勝信念者也。</p>
<p>本會議出席人員，職責所在，對於本屆議決警政之改革　推進，自當秉承中央命令，生死以赴。深恐自見未週，掛一漏萬，尙希全國有識之士，有以督責之幸甚。</p>
<h3>小倉正恒抵平　向記者團談話</h3>
<p>北二十六日中央社電　東亞經濟　談會會長小倉正恒氏，以經　訪問團之資格，及藉出席北　舉行之東亞經濟懇談會事機會，巳於二十三日搭機抵此。二十五日下午三時，於旅邸會目記者團，暢談此行之目的。謂余此行除為出席東亞經濟懇　會外，並以經濟訪問團之名義，與此間當局暫中日經濟界晤談，藉以深刻認　華北之經濟情勢。並將疏通彼此之意志，俾於中日經濟提携上有所貫獻。此次舉行之懇談會，係以大東亞各民族間之經濟，得以融合，以此　成最高度經濟力使之戰力化。日本政府亦正鞏固强化國內體制，故此次之懇談會，實具有深遠重大之意義。</p>
<h3>襲北千島美機　幾全部覆滅</h3>
<p>莫斯科二十六日中央社電　據塔斯社二十五日訊：九月十二日轟炸北千鳥之美機，內有七架因機件發生障磚，於該日落於堪察加，蘇官方即時將機體及駕駛員全部扣留。按轟炸北千島之美機共十八架，內九架被日軍擊落，七架今判明陴落蘇領，其餘二架是否已安返美軍根據地，尚屬不　，故此次轟炸北千島之美　幾與去年空襲日本土者，同樣　於全滅地步。</p>
<h3>英閣局部改組</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十六日中央社電　據倫敦　：英首相官邸二十五日發表改組後之內開名單如次：樞密院議長阿特里，財相安德森，自治領相克蘭朋，掌區大臣勃洛克，外交次官羅伊，授有閣員牠位，樞密院議長阿特里除有樞相之地位外，並仍有副首相，得加入戰時內閣，自治領相兼貴族院總裁，以兩種資格得出席戰時內閣舉行之會請，新閣員羅伊輔佐外相，辦理外交事宜</p>
<h3>島田少佐廣播　「空中决戰體制」</h3>
<p>南京廿六日中央社電　日軍報道部島田已勝少佐，廿五日下午七時牛，在中央廣播電台廣播，題為「空中決戰體制」，其大要如下：　大東亞戰爭現正展開最事烈之空中戰，對前方海陸空將士，日夜奮勇進行戰鬥之功，　衷心表示感謝　大束亞戰爭之現階段，係在空中爭勝敗之決戰，而目前在空中決戰態勢上應考處者大別有三：第一為北方阿留地安千島方面；其二為緬甸及重慶抗戰地區間，其三為西南太平洋方面。　日軍自七月下旬開始擊滅駐渝美空軍之作戰，巳獲得大戰果，而打破敵人反攻計劃，尙在進行戰事中。八月份日軍擊落敵機數為三十五架，西南太平洋方面數百架飛機蔽空交戰，擊落飛機自然亦多。然駐渝美空軍攻則退避，止則來襲，對於此種空中遊擊，學落其機，實為日空軍發揮其戰爭精神之所在也。</p>

<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>主席團袁履登致開會詞云：今天是市商會常年會員大會，迴憶本會恢復以來，倏逾一年，照章應於本年六月間召開常年會員大會，因為當時適値各同業公會奉令紛紛改組歸併，無從召集，所以遲延到今天開會。迴憶此一年以來，正値大東亞戰爭時期，在這種迥踰尋常局面之下，一切的一切，都在風波動　之中，首當其衝者自是工商業。工業的衰落，商業的凋敝，自然不能例外，所望這是一時的畸形現象，期待永久的光明的到來。又在這工商界交困之秋，本會處此環境之下，對於工商業痛苦，同人等雖曾略盡棉薄，但是自愧效力很微，引為遺憾。但是本會始終以穩健的立場，硜硜自守，一以工商業利益為前題，這是我們撫躬循省，俯仰無愧，也可以對會員告慰的。然天下的事情，不進則退，我們檢討過去，審察現在，噡念將來，履籍堅冰，深滋　懼。本會在此環境之下，究竟應該如何推進會務，如何改善現狀，凡此犖犖大端，自應視其遠大，履登不才，願聞明敎。</p>
<p>討論提案</p>
<p>旋即討論提案，　絲號業。綢緞號業·絲織廠業三公會聯合提議：絲及絲製品在三省二市區域內，依法准許自由搬運，本市經濟局訓令，本市主要商品移動應呈經該局核准發給許可證，與法抵觸，應謂呈部糾正案，議決呈部糾正。　布廠業公會提紗布攸關各業，因政府明令收買鈔布，以致資金週轉不靈，和產機構將瀕破產，擬請轉呈當局救濟，並准將紗布給價特別定期存單准許貼現，以資維持案，議決以上海特別市商會投表大會名義，分呈行政院曁財政部實業部，　陳收買紗布後，攸關各業困苦情形，懇請予以金融上之救濟，准將紗布給價特別定期存單，免息貼現，並祈批示祇遵。　茶食業，汽水菓汁製造業，蜜錢念品業三公會聯請，本會等因各種出品，均須需用食糖，以前因尙有存貨，勉强維持，近數月來存貨用罄，而配給數量反見減少。至於茶食業與蜜餞業，雖曾申請配給，迄未允准，以致出呂原料深感缺乏，請求分函上海各配給機關儘量予以接濟　糖，而免出品上之困難。議決交理事會辦理。　九春欣提：查煤球原料配給各廠逐月減少，今冬更甚，其原因實為各路運輸困難。可否呈請常局將上海煤球原料，規定爲運蝓儘速項巨，通令各路一體遵行，以安民生，並　當局設法採購洋煤，以厚存底，而免恐慌案，讀付公決。議決由會請求當局。　吳孝侯提，為擬發起籌組全國商會聯合會案。議決保留。臨時動議；彈花業，餅饅油燴號業等代表均要求交涉配給原料，議決須具書面報告，以便核辦。</p>
<h3>鼓勵檢舉囤積　儲備巨額獎金　罐頭食品進口數可觀　但市價已漲至最高峯</h3>
<p>目前本埠各項尙未實行計口授給之主要食物，其重要性猶如肥皂火柴等，實急需實施統制，如罐頭食品及其他食物，業巳將價格漲至最高之地步，市民巳無購買意思，罐頭食物之進口，雖在此時期中，其數量仍頗為可觀，惟以囤積商活動之結果，致又於最近漲上百分之二百至三百，至於菜塲方面，則公衆亦盼常局注意。據泰晤士報記者探悉，為對主要物品之囤積者實施更進一步之制裁辦法起見，當局頃已決定備儲巨額賞格，獎勵一切對囤積商施行密告之市民，查此次辦法之決定，乃由於星期五在跑馬廳舉行物資調查委貝會時議決，該會同時並商定懲罰紗布未行登記者之方法。</p>

<h3>日德義同盟三週年　廣田情報部長談話</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　本月二十七日爲日德義三國同盟成立三週年紀念日，日上海大使館慶田情報部長特發表談話如次：</p>
<p>「昭和十三年九月二十七日締結三國同盟，當時適為歐洲戰爭勃發後一年。締結後一年，大東亞戰爭又告爆發，遂繼績於同年十二月十一日發表三國同盟追加協定，向來之三國同盟性格遂由政治同盟變為軍事同盟，建設世界新秩序之斷然決意，由此充分聞明。茲已逢第三週年，其間締約國之一義大利，因違反同盟條約而告脫離，現同盟之申心為日德二國。然加入此條約者，除日德外，尙有數國，一致在强力提携之下，繼續作戰，如上之背信行為，在軸心陣營方面僅為一種試練，並無任何痛苦不利。關於此點，觀於九月十五日日德兩國政府所發表之共同聲則即可明瞭。</p>
<p>日德共同聲明內稱「巴特里奥政府之背信行為，對於三國條約並無些微影響，該條約之效力絕無任何變化，大日本帝國及大德意志政府共同具有盡一切手段，在獲得最後勝利之前，努力進行此次戰爭之決意」。軸心各國在獲得此次戰爭最後勝利之前，團結益見緊密，因巴特里奧之背信，使義大利國民一時失去作戰名譽，然目前該兩國民巳在新政治的努力之下，開始更生，吾人亦深望其早舉成果。</p>
<p>建設世界新秩序決非易事，須具有堅强意旨，凡意志薄弱之投機主義者，實不足以與共語。軸心國之作戰目的，換言之即在解放自由與民生，反軸心國之目的則在完成英美陳腐之制霸世界野心，及過去用野心所獲得之現狀之維持，並金權全義之擴張是也。彼等計劃戰後世界所有之航空路，均須由美國飛機獨占，海上努力由英美掌握，一切金融組織由英美之金融財閥執管。由此可見其唯一目的實在制霸世界，不外欲壓迫世界之一切民族歸其隸屬。對於此點，尤其中國有識之士，更有檢討過去歷史加以思考必要。</p>
<p>目下世界戰局巳化爲有史以來之攻防戰，且巳演進為長　戰，深信世界民族理解此三國同盟之理念及軸心軍之作戰目的者，業已日見加多。三國同盟是否係予人類之發展以光明，及鬼計之英美同盟是否能帶來人類之幸福，自能瞭然。三國同盟各國當今通入締結第四年之際，對於今後益將遭週之深刻試練，成具決心。茲三度宣言對於今次以救濟世界人類為目的之聖戰，在未獲得最後勝利之前，決不罷手，善必克服一切苦難，貫澈始終。深信同盟締約國之連繫日見堅實鞏固。</p>

<h3>申報週刊　復刊第四號　貝拉灣上驅逐艦　撞破敵艇建立奇功　採用急衝戰法拯救友艦</h3>
<p>八月二日未明，在所羅門島中部激戰塲的可倫班加拉島四方海內貝拉灣上，對敵方萬速魚雷艇，以猛烈的據碰而摧毀，並且把敵艇裂而爲二，然後擊沉。這樣我們騙逐艦空前的武藝，是遠超過海戰常識，且是世界海戰史上被天荒的俠事。該艦只是這糧勇敢無比的奮鬥，已不僅足以使敵人心戰膽寒，且更足以鼓舞我方的士氣。</p>
<p>大無畏的突擊</p>
<p>在中倫班加拉島方面海面上，我方水雷戰隊的神出鬼沒，大事活躍，經常威脅着敵人，於是企圖阻撓我方而起的敵人，佔着數量上的優勢，而從空中不斷的轟炸，同時在風平浪靜時，則在海洋上不斷出動人批魚當艇，在空中和在海上，密密張起無間隙的綱，以對付我方出擊的艦船，這就是目前的情形。在這種悄形下橫衝直衝，獻家掩護我方運輸，切斷敵方補充的水雷戰隊的行動，正如衝入敵方準備好了的槍林中去一樣，一次又一次地，不外是眞正大無畏的突擊。此次驅逐艦〇〇號的奇蹟，決不是偶然倖致的結果，正好捨棄砍殺的劍而搶救陷於危急的友艦一樣，因而是置之死地而後生的實　戰果。下面就是在建立奇功的驅逐艦上，聽取指揮撞碰戰法的〇〇司令所講的奮鬬情形。</p>
<p>同友艦沉敵艇</p>
<p>事件發生的前夕，即一號夜裏，驅逐艦〇〇號擔負着某種任務，掩謹着友艦〇艘，在貝拉灣上向南行，正在趕路的時候，突然發見了準備交綏的敵方魚雷艇六艘，爲先發制人計，便與友艦一同，向數方猛烈進襲，我方一齊發射着雨點密的猛烈砲火，須臾問擊沉敵艇兩艘，一艘大砲，其他抱頭鼠窺。如是不久的時間，我艦便進入可島椗泊地，任務終了後，二號〇時整隊出搭，向歸途前進。</p>
<p>在黑暗海面上</p>
<p>友艦可島附近的海面上向北航駛，而〇〇號則掩護着周圍，在友艦之後追趕着。此時，在司令的腦海中，早巳料到昨天逃走的敵方殘餘魚曾艇，一定會爲了復仇而在什麼地埋伏着。全體海員都各自在自己的崗位上，密切地注意着，警戒着，在陰暗的海面上，留着雪白的航跡，迅速地向北直駛。氣候雖然不環，但沒有月光的海面，只是漆黑一團，完全被黑幕籠罩着，視綫是極端不良的。正當隊約在右面看着可島的山影，繼續前進的長光，突然左般的瞭望員急促地大聲喊叫：「左舷前方有魚雷艇」。在艦橋上站着的司令，艦長等人，隨着聲音，用普通眼講也可以看到，己艦的左前方，有三個黑影向友艦直駛撲去。</p>
<p>衝上去救友艦</p>
<p>距離僅〇〇公尺，開砲轟　業已來不及了。對於不知不覺仍然前進的友艦，如被擊中魚曾，那末友艦就糟糕了，於是〇〇司令，柱這一刹那，已經決心，大家都心照不官地瞭解了艦長唯一的決心。就是撞碰一法。打算犧牲自己，救出〇艘友艦來。</p>
<p>「衝上去」這樣發出近代海戰從未前聞的號令。開足馬力，我們驅逐艦對着最近的魚需艇猛進。在眼前面，看着敵方魚實艇的黑影急駛衝過，在這一瞬間，像剃刀一樣銳利的驅逐艦之洞腹，切過去了。吱吱吱吱的衝動聲音，同時把所有的人都震倒了。緊接着在一號跑塔的左側，突然覺着好像起了火。統過的油烟，落到艦橋方面來。向着司令等人的臉上，像毛毛爾般地撲過來很多油烟。撞上魚雷艇，正如撞上魚雷一樣。</p>
<p>「是魚雷爆發麼？」當時以爲撞錯了，但不大的工夫，看見兩個大火球燃燒着，掠過般側，流向後而去了。這就是我們驅逐艦的洞腹，把敵方魚實艇，從機器部處，一切兩斷的原故。在右競流動着的那一塊，立刻就看不見了，但在左舷流動着的那一塊，在火燄當中，又突然出現了一艘魚電艇。</p>
<p>重行猛烈砲轟</p>
<p>〇〇號驅逐艦及時又對牠加以猛烈的砲轟。也許牠看到被切斷的魚實艇已經無法挽救，因而冒着彈雨便消逝於海上。這正如拔出劍來砍斷敵人。又一囘刀作了一個泰山壓頂之勢，這可以說，像日本刀那樣的銳利。另外一艘，不知什麽時候也沒有了。〇〇號驅逐艦，在前端像受了一刀砍傷的程度，，在速度上並未發種任何影響。〇般我方艦船，整齊地，雄糾糾地向北前進着。而這個驅逐艦追趕着友艦的後面，逐漸離開了戰塲。</p>
<p>在敵人投射魚雷之前，能夠撞碎牠，而使友艦未遭損害，這可以說是上策。</p>
<p>關於自爆決心，據碰敵方魚雷艇時的悲壯心境，司令只說了一句，想戰下去。（漢譯自九月十一日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>南太平洋壯烈　血戰記</h3>
<p>以所羅門羣鳥新佐治亞爲中心的日美第一綫決戰，不分晝夜，愈演愈烈，遭受對方陸海空三而頑强襲擊的我方睦地部隊，其艱苦作戰情形，實在雖以言語和筆墨形容。七月十四日，美軍答快遠艦及戰鬥機掩護下、用登陸艇七十艘從海的正面向蒙逮東側地區大舉殺來，我方守備隊一舉即擊沉其二十艘，同時爲配合作戰由陸地來襲的敵兵五百名，也打落水底，葬於魚腹，下面便是這一壯烈的奮戰記。</p>
<h3>蒙達守備隊</h3>
<p>新佐治亞島蒙達前面淸水台處的口口部隊淸水隊（隊長清水三郎中尉）的陣地，因遭受敵方連日的砲轟，而幾千年未曾受到斧鈍砍伐的森林區，竟成爲一顆小樹也不存在的一片焦土。七月十二日，打擊敵方小部隊的清水隊，因連日遭受敵方的砲轟，所以就猜想到敵軍將從附近營比安島方而海上要來登陸，於是便把陣地　移到蒙迷的東面海岸上。</p>
<p>倉本正夫中尉的砲兵隊也把自巳所有的砲安置在海岸上，準備與淸水隊駢肩作戰。陣地轉移到海岸去的第三天（七月十四日），天氣非常清期，可以看得　遠隔三千公尺的碧海上漂浮着的魯比安島。</p>
<p>上午七點，淸水隊長得到報吿說：敵人在戰鬬機及快速艦的掩護下，用登陸艇七十艘，向　達方面迫近。於是就和倉本砲兵隊長決定用砲和機關槍對付海上正面來的敵方船隻，用步槍對付陸地來的五百敵兵。</p>
<p>當敵方七十多　艇船駛到我方七百公尺的時候　倉本和清水兩隊長不約而同地，在同一個時間大聲喊出「射擊」。早已準備好了的砲手們就一齊開火射擊。於是敵方的數艘舟艇和手足慌亂的兵士，一同消逝於海上。仗恃着數量優勢的敵方舟艇，也用砲囘擊。他們射出的砲彈非常準確。我們射出四五十發砲彈的時候，敵軍中就出現轉變方向關始逃走的傢伙。敵軍的舟艇在水點，砲烟，以及自已所放出的烟幕中，陷於大混亂。而我方的砲身都完全熱紅了，同時襯托着被敵彈打中而濺出來的滿臉紅血之兵士，氣勢愈益旺盛了。</p>
<p>陸地來聽的敵軍看到了這種悽慘的悄形，雖然早已喪魂吊胆、但仍然很迅速地迫近到我方陣地來。於是我方　乓部隊就一齊向美兵集中火力射擊。敵人完全陷於我們猛烈火綱的包圍裏，曾受到　重損失。我們帝國軍隊就乘着這個機會，安上刺刀，心裏想着「地媽的，這批美國傢夥們」，就衝向美軍去。敵軍在叫苦連天當中，開始漬退了。</p>
<p>敵方戰關機看到我們和他們的步兵混戰肉博到一起，就無法施行機槍掃射。陸海兩方面的壯烈苦鬬，繼續半個鐘頭，就停止了。</p>
<p>在這塲惡鬬中，敵舟艇被擊沉二十雙，海陸兩方陣亡敵方將士共一千五百多名。而我方只戰死十五名，受傷五名，口口門大砲富中，只右一砲車輸損壞。</p>
<h3>薩拉摩阿地　方的七個斥堠</h3>
<p>新幾內亞島薩拉摩阿方面的向美苦戰，決不下於所羅門島。下面就叙述七個　敢的軍官斥堠，擊潰敵方一個小部隊，探得敵情，奇襲迫擊砲陣地，鹵獲二門而歸的奮戰記。</p>
<p>薩拉摩阿方面羅甘高地前面的敵軍，日甚一日地向海岸綫迫近，且隨帶着登陸用舟艇悄悄地想準備登陸。羅甘高地駐守的我方部隊長，決意在敵方尙未建好的期間，給他們一個當頭棒喝，於是在總攻擊前為了偵探敵情，就決定選派斥堠長平山嘉一中尉，斥堠倉田中士，大塚伍長，壺之穀兵長，益子兵長，穀田貝兵長，長山一等兵等共七名。</p>
<p>口月口日的一早，這個斥堠隊分別携帶着輕機關槍兩架，鹵獲品的自動步槍兩支，步槍兩支，手溜彈多枚，以及兩天給的食糧。是柱正午的時候，當在靠近山谷的森林中簡進的平山斥候隊，突然聽到美軍兵談話的聲音。是敵方五名通信兵在休息。谷田員兵長就情悄地前進，用機關槍一射就完全擊倒了。在太陽將落的時分，繞到敵方右方背後去的斥候隊，發現了大約五百敵人在羅甘高地前面的濤岸上露營。</p>
<p>第二天早晨八點　左右，經過險峻的斜坡，向山谷下走的時候，看到敵人所權成的迫擊砲陣地。在攝着兩門這擊砲，再仔細一看，有二十個敵兵在附近看守着。平山中尉微笑發說：「把牠搶來」。於是七人爬過森林，走到迫擊砲陣地二十公尺處，而敵人仍然尙朱覺察。很鎭定的七人就突然用機關槍及自動步槍開火掃射，敵兵一聽槍響就驚慌失措地向後面逃走，但一看我們人數太少，就又站下用自動步槍及擲彈槍和我們應戰。倉田中士及長山一等兵很勇敢地爬到敵人面前，正想要揮刀砍殺。就在這個時候，大胆的平山中尉就跑到敵陣去，把一門敵人的迫擊砲抱着拖過來，而中尉看到敵兵驚慌的樣子，又跑過去把那一門迫擊砲也拖過來。</p>
<p>在這個期間，他的部下之人差不多把敵兵將殺完了。而平山中尉命令：「倉田　大塚！帶起這擊砲來！」於是二人就一個拖着一門砲回到森林來。當時長山一等兵被自動步槍子彈穿過左大腿。鮮血染紅了長山一等兵的軍裝。長山一等乓很痛苦地說『隊長！請不要管我吧！』須臾間，就喪失了所有的力量，最後喊了一聲：『天皇陛下萬歲！』就死了。平山中尉等六人悲痛地離別了長山一等兵的屍首，而又開始前進了。爲了報長山戰友的仇，在途中曾遇見通信兵十二名，以及連絡兵十名，一個沒剩地都解決了他們的生命。</p>
<p>第二天的晚上，悄悄地在敵軍背後走着。曾剪斷了繫在倒了的枯木上的敵軍電話綫。把身邊的手榴彈迅速地拋到有敵兵的戰壕裏，就敏捷地逃走了</p>
<p>平山斥堠隊帶着兩門迫擊砲走了一夜，第三天早晨間到了自己的部隊。而當天晚上，〇〇部隊就根據平山中尉的報吿，開始猛攻前面的敵人。（南大平洋方面〇〇地方的淺岡特派員發）（漢　自九月三日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>老爐工的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 凌祖仁</p>
<p>七月——一個炎熱季節裹的一天。</p>
<p>我踏進爐子間，迎面撲來一陣高熱度的熱風，不由得使我倒退了一步。地上和牆上的士敏土，也給爐火薰得似乎要裂開似的，人踏進去，就宛如跑進火窟的一般。</p>
<p>這時，我們的老爐工阿能，正立在爐子前部的火門前，軍雙有力的膀子，擎起一把鳥亮的煤簽，把滿滿的一鑒煤　，填向爐肚裹去。</p>
<p>在暢開的兩個火門裹，燃燒着的煤塊發出熊熊的火燄，不住地在烘！烘！的嘶叫、熾熱的通紅的火燄，把阿能蒼老而黝黑的臉龐，染上了一片嬌紅。他熟練地給每一個火門裏，餧了足量的煤屑以後，就關上了火門，順手把煤簽扔在身後的煤堆上，跑過來。在我身畔的一張條凳的一端，坐了下來，從肩頭拉下了一條明黑又髒的毛巾　揩拭了一下臉額上的汗滴，嘴裏，吐出了一口深長的氣，像喘息也　嘆息。</p>
<p>我本能的以我一種探索的目光，投射上他的臉龐時，我覺得還是一張多夠醜噁的臉呀！那蒼老而乾枯的臉龐上，塗染着一層薄薄的煤灰，它的臉色。就使人想到黃昏時的蒼茫的暮色。額上臉上密佈着一條條給「人生」磨練出來的深刻的皺紋，更黏附着汗液和煤灰混凝的膩垢，就像在雨天給車輸輾過的車道的痕跡一樣，兩隻深陷的眼眶裹，埋着兩顆失神的眼珠，吐露着一　絕望而茫然的目光。這是一張醜陋的，粗老的，苦痛的，一個老年勞工的臉我看見他在流着汗，在喘著息，就很關心地問他：</p>
<p>「阿能！很熱呵！」</p>
<p>嗯！很熱，他抬了抬頭。</p>
<p>「你很乏力嗎？」</p>
<p>喔！淩先生！不！還好！不過。一年年紀一年人，年老了，就什麼都不濃了。」語氣中充溢着一種唏噓的情調，並糝雜着一些感激我關心的情昧了</p>
<p>他又垂了下頭。</p>
<p>「那末；你有多大的年紀了呢？」</p>
<p>「五十三歲了哇！」</p>
<p>「呣！，是年老了！那你當了爐工有多久了呢？」</p>
<p>「大慨……有近三十年了吧！」他像一個在夢中被喚醒的人，在努力追索夢的　痕一般地，兩眼望着屋頂，屈着手指的說。</p>
<p>「呀！已有三十年了！」我的神情，露着驚奇，又像感嘆」</p>
<p>「不錯！已有三十年了，我的大半世的光陰，是給這爐子裏的火燄所燒毀了……」語調有些兒激憤，像在惋惜失去的靑春，慨嘆現實的殘酷，我像瞧見這可憐的老年人的年老的心在顫抖，不待我的揷口，他又說下去了，語調，是顯得更激憤，不像是老年人的口吻：</p>
<p>「我們窮人的命運，是注定受苦的，雖然，在年青的時候，我也同一般青年人一樣的富於理想，我作過許多美麗的幻夢，在爐火裏，我也曾　築過幻想中的樂團，我熱烈地期望着它的實現，這樣的，一年·二年·三年……爲着希望而努力工作着，期待着，但是：三十年了，殘酷的現實，就將我以　美麗的幻夢，理想中的樂園，給打擊得粉碎，我也曾求過上帝，但是：它也沒有給我一些切實的力量，現在我是絕望了，我讓我的殘年，在火燄裏逐漸的消蝕·毀減，一直到我全生命結束的時候，我很明白，我們窮人，是永不會幸福的，是瞧不見一些光明的。」我見到他蒼老黝黑的臉，在苦痛的痙孿着，一股他言語所表顯不出的情緒、在他目光中閃動，我知道情感在猛烈的擊撞他年老的心胸。</p>
<p>「你不要失望，你出一分勞力，就會有一分的收獲，窮人並不是完全沒有幸福的，沒有希望的。」我像勸慰，又像鼓勵地對他說。</p>
<p>哼！出一分勞力，就可以有一分的收獲，這還不是一句欺人的話，三十年來，我的力量，出過不可以說是少了，但是收獲呢？現在的我還不是給生活在折磨着，甚至，我養不活我的妻子和兒女，不得不使他們以自己的力量去養活自己！」憤懣的音調，拖曳着苦澀。</p>
<p>我不自禁地，向我身旁埋下了頭，罩在濃重陰影下的老爐工，深深地看了一眼，心頭就給激引起了一陣同情的激　，我覺得周圍的空氣，是異常的冷酷，再也不是火熱的，我默默地垂下了頭。我們都跌入沉寂裏。</p>
<p>在踏出爐子間的時候，我的耳際，還依稀的浮着那苦澀的情調。</p>

<h3>小荼房</h3>
<p>— 司徒琦</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>是午後第一課尙未上課的時候。</p>
<p>「咦！這小茶房是那兒來的？哈哈，芋艿頭，哈哈……」</p>
<p>「個小鬼倒是　好玩的，像個泥娃娃。」</p>
<p>「………………」</p>
<p>第十教室裏的學生看見昨天新來的小茶房打門外走過，頑皮的一些就趕看笑着，吵鬧着，通探手去摸他的較凸出些的後腦。</p>
<p>小茶房現在的任務是送熱水瓶到辦公室去。</p>
<p>他遇到了學生們的取笑，却祇是紅起醬紫色的臉，睜着大眸子，射着驚奇的光芒，戇笑着。這予以頑皮的一羣增興不少，在他幹完職務後，又經過外面時，就拉住了他任意地尋取歡笑的村料，胡鬧着。</p>
<p>「幾歲啦？小茶房。」</p>
<p>「十四歲已服務社會了，唉！阿彌陀佛，前途無量。」</p>
<p>「哈哈，可是小崇明，不會錯吧？」</p>
<p>「喂！叫甚麼名字呀。唸過書嗎！」</p>
<p>「阿祥？甚麼阿祥阿盤地，還是叫小茶房實惠些。」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈哈，小茶房！小茶房！……」</p>
<p>小茶房忙着囘答發問的一羣，直慌得驚惶失措。却全虧訓育主任及時駕到，纔算解了小茶房的大圍。可是那些小嘍囉們却早已一聲「風緊」轟散得無痕無跡。受到幾句申斥的還是眼光猶自散漫的小茶房。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>放學後，小茶房在敎室裏掃地，他瞧着黑板上的許多團白粉莫名其妙，除了一個「中」字是由雀牌上識來的，但由了好奇，小茶房也想學習寫字。他拿起粉筆在黑板上照樣地書着，左手還依舊挾着掃帶。半嚮總算成了一個滿意的「中」字，其餘却一無所就。</p>
<p>舉着手，仰着　子地盡，小茶房覺得異常吃力。他正預備要息手不幹了，齊巧外面走過兩個還沒囘家的學生，是第十敎室裹的，小茶房記得挺牢。那兩個立刻無意識地嚷起來：</p>
<p>「好啊！小茶房學寫字了，哈哈……」</p>
<p>小茶房漲紅了臉，趕緊加速度地扔去粉筆，伏下頭去掃地。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>明天、小茶房又是任着頑劣的學童們的糾纏着。甚至那第十敎室裹的一個命他怏倒杯茶來，他立刻認眞地照辦，忙着尋杯呀等等，正當大號「閻羅王」的訓育主任適巧走來，那學生慌得大恐，急急地儘着嘴輕呌：</p>
<p>「唉，唉唉，不用了……」</p>
<p>然而，小茶房却被玩弄得不知所之，瞪着大眼，不明白這是怎麼一樁玩藝兒。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>每晚，學校關上大門後。小茶房幹完事情，就坐着想，是胡思剛想，</p>
<p>「　長根說，他們是甚麼中學生了。哦，中學生，夠多麼好？」小茶房想，他以為是先成了中學生，纔有命令自己的少爺地位。</p>
<p>所以，這是對手，小茶房認為少爺們的發問或命令，一定也要像長根所吩咐挪般必勤必忠。本來嘿，是主僕呀。</p>
<p>久之，久之，小茶房漸漸地不感到世界有甚麼矛盾，一切者在自然的軌道上進行着。</p>
<h3>羽頌</h3>
<p>— 村汀</p>
<p>去年秋天底一天，我曾徜徉在古城西方底軍山中一聲日。那天天氣並小好，陰沉沉地似乎要下雨，可是我的心坎中郤充滿了喜悅。</p>
<p>我立在山麓下，遠遠的村莊，朦朧中依稀　散着輕烟，漸漸地冒出，又漸漸地消失：在我底後面是一座殷紅的樹林，鮮艷得像女人們的朱唇；前方是一廣漢的稻田，金色的波浪在衛風中不住翻捲，雖然天是一日漫漫的，我總覺得一種莫名的欣慰侵襲着我，在這一刹那我感到天地間好像祗有我一個人的勢力，我就是大自然的主宰者！</p>
<p>陷入了極度的深思，我想到嵯峨的磕　疊嶂，溶溶的江川……而我所立的地方，就是一切山川的縮影，我欣幸自己竟會來到山川的縮影裏來做統治者！於是隨手拾起一根鳥類的自羽，吹一口氣讓它隨風飄去，我目送它凌空而去，心中陡然湧起一陣頌語，低低地，喃喃地小語着。</p>
<p>「祝福你，我不知道你遺自白鴿抑或鷹隼，我祇曉得你在我底心目中是潔白的，你在空氣中飄揚時也是潔白的，你現在從我手中飄出，我願你得到一個美滿的歸宿。</p>
<p>「你也許會掉在近處的泥淖裏，順從地忍受一切汚穢，幽暗；你也許會捲入蕩發的大河中，被吞入了魚腹，或在浪花中翻騰：你也許要暫時停息在稻穗上，靜待狂風的再來了，你也許要墮入蓬勃的野草間、接受荊棘的挽留：你也許會飛入甘泉，或者附着在高樹。</p>
<p>「可是我礽願你飛！用力地飛！永遠飄揚在空中，我既不願你落在污穢的地面上，更不願你長留在　　的密雲裹，但願你能衝破駿　，直上靑雲！」</p>
<p>我幾乎忘了自已，得到發覺自己還呆立着才呼出一口氣。</p>
<p>天空在淅淅地下雨了，我慌忙躲在一棵丹楓下，再抬起頭看時，那羽毛早已不見了。</p>
<h3>命運</h3>
<p>— 劉嘉蒞</p>
<p>又是初秋的季節了，使我囘億起去年這時候在故鄉所目覩的一件殘忍的實事。</p>
<p>一個將近黃昏的下午，我正在臥室中看巴金的「生與死」，忽然聽得芳妹跑來吿訴我前面兪家—我們的鄰居！今天領了一個童養媳，叫我趕快去看。我被好奇心所驅使，急忙放了手中的書，跟着她跑到前進，剛走進客堂間早擠滿了人，前後左右的鄰居們都來了，正中桌子上點了一對紅燭，她上舖着紅氈毯，一個十四五歲的小姑娘，頭上梳了二條小辦子，插了一些花，身上穿了花布衣　，非常的整潔，一個圓圓的驗蛋，配着烏溜溜的一付眼睛，倒也惹人喜愛，大槪是怕羞的緣故吧！低着頭，眼睛看着脚上的一雙紅花布鞋，坐在桌子旁邊的小竹椅上。「就是這姑娘嗎？」我問芳妹：「是的你看長的倒不錯」，芳妹笑笑點點頭。許多人都在論長說短的批評着。</p>
<p>過後我得知了一些這姑娘的來歷，她—梅蘭是兩近鄉下的女孩子，因爲雙親的亡故，以致被她的遠房叔叔：賣給同村的張家做童養媳，不到一年這張家的兒子死亡了，所以現在她又被轉賣到兪家來，梅蘭每天要料理一家的家務事，燒飯，洗衣，做女紅，她總是辛苦的操勞着，空下來的時俟，帶頜着五歲的小叔，慢慢的她跟我們相熱了，有時也吿訴我們一些傷心的往事，但我們爲了免得她囘億起悲痛的往事，所以總是用別的話來安慰她已受創傷的心靈。</p>
<p>不料三個月之後，她的未來的丈夫兪家的十四歲的兒子，得了很重的傷寒症，由於她們的延誤，沒有早些請醫生診治，等到病重的時候已經來不及教治而死亡了，梅蘭受不了這刺激，她放聲的大哭了，她不是悲哀着這孩子的死亡，他跟她活着的時侯就不理睬，他們之間沒右絲毫的感情的存在，她悲哀的是她未來的命運，惡劣的不幸事總是降臨到她的身上，她不敢想以後是怎樣的一個結果，一些惡毒的咒磨在啃痛她創傷的心，她婆母更罵她是「孤婦星」把她凶子的命送掉，雖說他們在事前也請瞎子算過命合過嬌，現在他們都忘了，梅蘭祇有傷心的痛哭來發洩她內心所受的說不出的痛楚。</p>
<p>一星期後，我們眼望着一個年老的鄉下婦人把梅蘭帶去了，這無疑是兪家又把她轉賣了，她無聲的跟着老婦人頭也不囘的去了，我目送着她—這不幸的可憐的姑娘，是誰摧殘了她脆弱的心靈，是誰使她受的這些苦難，是命運嗎？抑或是………？</p>
<p>現在又到這時候了，我囘憶起這件事心裏非常的難過，我們同情她，惋惜她，但是我們不能使她脫離遭非人的生活和這不幸的遭遇，一直到現在我內心仍是在內疚着，現在不知她是否平安的生活着，遙祝這可憐的姑娘永遠無恙！（却酬）</p>

<h3>最近提倡之圓門球　根據體育原理鎔中西球戲於一爐</h3>
<p>圓門球爲新製球戲，係　旭滄君於二年前所發明，錢君爲教育學者。對於體靑運動。亦深切研究。除指導籃球田徑賽外；根據體育原理，發明圓門球，鎔中西球戲於一爐。提侶以來。逐漸普及。颇受體青界之許。　普及杯圓門球聯賽，即將舉行。本報特請錢君　着圓門球文一篇，俾社會人士讀之、對於此種新型球戲之意義及規則。更能明瞭也。</p>
<h3>創始之動機</h3>
<p>余生平對於體育初無所知。惟髫齡就學，輙喜與村童爲伍，鎮日以小球爲戲，稍長於足球籃球排球，曾一度寢饋其中，覺有無上之興趣。旣冠受業大學。專攻敎育，稱稍涉獲中外敎育名着及體育理論，知運動非惟可以增進身體之健康，且足以改進國民之心理與道德，實爲教育之初階，合體育即無救育。蓋皮之不存，毛將爲附，讀書聞道，必先右堅强之意志，剛毅之精神，康强之體格，健全之心理，始足以言讀與聞。不然　未讀而已病，朝聞道而夕死，或心意恍惚，或精力易疲；或不能深思篤打，或不能博學審問，雖有名師，亦無能爲役矣。、嘗謂孔門弟子如顏囘之天，子路之勇，曾參之普，悉與體格有關。惜平仲尼不知個性之善惡，有爾於體質，壽命之修天，悉視乎養生。不然四科之外，於個性體質如能兼　亞顧，則儒家之學不尤愈乎。</p>
<p>故體育實爲敎育之肇基，而體育之提倡首在運動之普及。欲謀述動之普及，必先引起國人對於運動之趣味，運動之巾最易引起一般人之趣昧者，厥爲球新運動。球戲流行於我關者甚早，先秦之時，請之蹴踘。漢劉向別錄云：「蹴踘黃帝所造，或云起於戰國，古人蹴踘以爲戲。」史記衛將軍傳：「穿城蹋躪」，註「即今之打毬也」。漢書霍去病傳註：「踘以皮爲之，實以毛，蹴蹋而戲」。蹴蹋皆訓爲踢，蓋即踢毬之戲也。宋時更詳共儀，豎木爲毬門，左右分門。與近今四洋之足球更近。元時則盛行馬球，其一鱗一爪。往往見於元代畫冊之中，令人對於神往。目前我國所流行之各　球類運動。大率直接來自西洋，與吾國社會情形頗多齟齬，故尚不能使其普及。余前曾有一文載於體育週報，略謂：</p>
<p>「大衆化球類運動約有四忌：一忌球員位置固定化，二忌動作劇烈化，三忌設備貴族化，四忌技術專門化。籃球之不能普遍，病在技術專門化，排球病在位置固定化，網球，馬球，水球，高爾夫球病在貴族化，美國式足球病在劇烈化。……」</p>
<p>故亟思創創一新型球戲，期合於國人之趣味與環境。蓄志數年，茫無頭緒，日校務冗雜、無暇深思，一日適值春假期中，以事偶過愛文義路卡德路轉角之荒塲，見其巾擁聚見童近百人，有放風箏者。有追奔逐北者、有袖手旁觀者，其中參加人數最多，而游戲最爲熱烈者，　爲投擲小球之戲。參加者大率以小學生及流浪兒童爲多。游戲之法，似參用籃球小球之規則，擲傳運投　殊活躍　雖空氣不甚緊張，而趣味的頗濃厚。因思一般學校之中，雖有運動塲之設備而平素確能參加加運動之學生，則寥若晨星，今此荒塲之兒童，反能自行覓取空地，聚數十人從事於投擲小球之戲，此非足爲從事敎育者研究之資料乎。返校之後。途以此荒塲兒童之游戲趣味與方式爲某礎，以我國宋元兩代蹴球之儀式爲參考。並擷取籃球，是球。排球，德式手球，水球之精華，镕中四球戲規制於一爐，使其趣味有籃球足球　之濃原而無過於劇烈之弊。數月之　計與試騐，乃完成圓門球之規制焉。</p>
<h3>球戲之槪况</h3>
<p>圓們球之球塲，成　方形，較籃球塲略大室內室外均可。在球塲之兩端，豎立一圓門，塲上以白綫劃分邊緩，端綫。中綫發球綫，　門區城綫。每隊比賽人數爲七人。（即守門員一人，中衛一人，左右內衛各一人，中鋒一人左右鋒各一人，大型球塲之面積及人數與足球間。）其中一人任守門之職，其餘各人，可用手及膝部以上之肢體，用任何方式，將球傳遞拍擲。（惟守門員在球門區域內可用足）以進入劉方圖門當目的，同時球員須嚴密防禦對方球員，將球進入水隊圓門。</p>
<h3>圓門之意義</h3>
<p>球門豎立於球塲之兩端，成右規則之圓角形，高二百十公分關三百六十公分，大小與小型足球門相埓。因球員以手擲球攻門，較以足爲準。球向球門左右兩上角進入。守門員最難防禦。茲爲減少守門員防禦之困難，及避免不可挽救之險救，以及增加比賽　行之興趣起見，故將球門兩角截成等半徑之半孤圓形，此即所以成爲圓門之簡單意義也。</p>
<h3>比賽之規則</h3>
<p>圖門球之規則，係參考籃球足球編纂而成。諸凡運球，拍球，擲球，傳球，跳球等動作，均與籃球類同。遠例及犯規之規定亦依雙球之成例。其罰則，分邊綫球，角球，球門球，　國任愈球，六公尺球等均與足球近似。至於守門員與球門區城之規則，　足球稍異，其中尤以球員進入球們區城之限制，最爲嚴密，球門區城成半圓形，除守門員外，不論任何球員進入球們區城綫者，　作犯規論、依事處罰。　餘規則，若比賽職員，比賽時間，開始比賽，暂停及進行，比春術語，勝負，達例，犯規，任意球，角球，六公尺球等，均於規則內專章幣訂，詳戰不遣。</p>
<h3>試賽之成績</h3>
<p>圓門球之游戲，旣如上述，惟恐閉門造車，不切寶際、板於三十年十一月十日，舉行試賽，茲摘錄當時報章之記載如下：</p>
<p>「圓門球白問世以來，運動界人士即紛紛以此爲談話資料，該項球賽是否能普遍全球，　莫談抽，籃球發跡在美國，初以擲球入木桶爲戲，今日竟能普及世界各國，常時發明人連　也　不到，在搖籃裏的間門球。其　透自未可限　，圓門球表　的消息傳出後，慕名來戳光的球迷種多，昨日下午二時許，便把開　中學塞得水洩不通，實開國　有史以來未有之盛况，首創人亦足以自慰矣。圓門球而右今日的收獲，誠不負他一番研究的苦心，三時正，比賽開始藍白首先間球……」</p>
<p>自此次試賽後，承各方人士之熱烈獎掖，且　上西人體育會方面，亦頗爲矚目。會自動參加中西　抗着三次，成繼異常圓滿，更有女子隊參加表演，下段為　章之記載，可以窺見常時盛况之一　：</p>
<p>『開門球雙雄友誼賽，於昨日下午三時起在光夏中學角逐，慕名作壁上觀者達二千餘人，情續熱烈，良友包松圍大　神遁，西實　說：</p>
<p>筏各界紛紛舉辦圓門球聯賽，如「國斌盃」「長　盃」「中學盃」等，殊極一時之盛云。</p>
<h3>今後之發展</h3>
<p>圓鬥球之誕生，適值找民族苦難之年，烽火連天，交通梗塞，甚至規則之寄過，亦多限阻。他日或可從出推廣，使其普及，並常廣諮博訪。薈萃各方之意見與批評，以個改進，是則右待於海內先進之支援與指導，非獨力所能爲矣。</p>

<p>該隊全體隊員，氣力均頗　足，不失北派典型，是其唯一爲滬上球迷賞識之點。</p>
<p>談共進攻策略，完全採取五鋒並　，而且絕少利用兩翼，三鋒　從中路並進而達到目的，除非對力的衛實力深遜，或者地位絕對不準外，簡直是很少希望的。我們祗要想一想，東動便祇從中路截　，僅該隊減少攻的機會、該隊兩翼的衷演，可說絕無。一得球之後，便始終想盤，結果以資格和技術的關係，全成　餅。所以在攻的力　而論，我以為應該多訓練採用W式及三角式進攻方法，兩翼多練習切中及頭項的功夫，至於守的方面，中衛綫，老　居中，不失老將風度，頗能前呼後應，林·孫·兩前衛，看人釘人，因其夠氣，可稱尙佳，然而阻到了球，不能控制，一腳能踢得遠，便算了事，與前鋒之不能呼應，失却攻的機會，這樣的前衛是不足取的，應練習控制球的能力，和球落點的腳頭，再談　衛，兩李一王，釘人功夫，頗爲一般球迷所贊許，尤其第二塲東華一役，李清玉死釘係老錦，特別精彩，其實亦多缺點，李淸玉注全副精神於老孫，一點不想兼顧令垚，於是李垚便自由自在，儘量活躍，造成不少勞力東華　格外利用兩翼，勝即在於斯，守門高　辰　小心慌，要亦經騐小足！</p>
<p>總論，以該隊體力的足，氣份的夠，多加以好的訓練，多給以對抗的機會，是能成爲一好的球隊，此行去矣，頗願他日再來，給我們更好的表演。</p>

<h3>Expressions of Wartime Enterprise</h3>
<p>There was a time when the American hat-making industry, due to mutual competition and unplanned production, fell into a tragic cycle of boom and bust. Because most capitalists at that time gathered and focused on the hat-making industry, believing it would be profitable, they each, without consulting each other, simultaneously established numerous hat factories, accelerating production. Subsequently, due to overproduction, sales stagnated; and because of stagnant sales, prices were cut for competitive sales, wages were reduced, workers were laid off, and the factories eventually could not sustain themselves, all heading toward ruin. After several years, hats became scarce again, and new competition arose in response. This formed a cycle of creation and destruction.</p>
<p>These American capitalists engaged in the hat-making industry, and it cannot be denied that they were pursuing a business. Their mutual competition and accelerated production cannot be denied as expressions of an entrepreneurial spirit. However, the result was that they all headed toward ruin due to overproduction and stagnant sales. Then, wasn't it harmed by the "entrepreneurial spirit"? In fact, that is not the case. Engaging in the hat-making industry was indeed pursuing a business; mutual competition and accelerated production were indeed expressions of an entrepreneurial spirit, but their failure was due to the "entrepreneurial spirit" not being complete!</p>
<p>A complete entrepreneurial spirit must have the spirit of striving for the success of the business with unwavering determination; for the purpose of the business, the desire to benefit oneself, benefit others, benefit society, and benefit the country; for the ideal of the business, the ambition to last forever; for the environment of the business, the method of adapting at any time to maintain survival.</p>
<p>Although American capitalists engaged in unplanned hat-making with an entrepreneurial spirit, their purpose was only to benefit themselves; their ideal was only to obtain huge profits in the short term; they could not adapt to the environment at any time. Everyone only knew how to compete with each other to obtain huge profits in the short term, without considering the future environment of mutual ruin due to overproduction; at the same time, having encountered the initial environment of stagnant sales, they failed to discuss adaptation methods with each other to maintain survival; and by deduction, they all headed toward ruin. Therefore, we say that the failure was due to the incompleteness of the "entrepreneurial spirit".</p>
<p>Of course, the "complete entrepreneurial spirit" mentioned above is not easy to achieve. However, for the success of personal undertakings, the success of social undertakings, and the success of national undertakings, everyone should hold this "complete entrepreneurial spirit" as a self-expectation. The scope of undertakings is extremely broad and large. Whether it is scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants, or even serving as officials and doing good deeds, they are all undertakings. It can also be said that everyone has their own undertaking. It is by no means only running factories and forming companies that count as undertakings.</p>
<p>We have a saying, "The predecessors plant the trees, and the descendants enjoy the shade." This saying, if interpreted positively, can be metaphorically used as the spirit of "entrepreneurial spirit". Because in order to facilitate the descendants to enjoy the shade, one must plant trees oneself. This is embracing the purpose of benefiting others; embracing the ideal of lasting forever, is a complete entrepreneurial spirit. During the late Qing Dynasty, Zuo Zongtang served as the Governor-General of Shaanxi and Gansu. For the sake of water conservancy in the desert areas, he planted willow trees, which are still convenient today. The local people are grateful for his continuous merits and call them Zuo Gong Willow. Zuo was an example of the expression of a "complete entrepreneurial spirit."</p>
<p>However, the above proverb, if interpreted negatively, is enough to be a portrayal of the entrepreneurial spirit of the general public today, because why should I work so hard to plant trees if it only makes it easier for future generations to enjoy the shade? With this kind of concept, the purpose of the undertaking is entirely based on the desire to benefit oneself, and even if the ideal of lasting forever is embraced, it is nothing more than planning for future generations. From the perspective of individuals, the undertaking may be successful, but from the perspective of society and the country, it is ultimately a failure.</p>
<p>All undertakings, in peacetime, already need the expression of an entrepreneurial spirit, and in wartime, they especially need the expression of an entrepreneurial spirit. Everything should be based on the national interest as a prerequisite. When personal interests conflict with national interests, personal interests should be absolutely abandoned. For example, the newly established Rice Control Committee is an undertaking that serves the people in wartime. Considering the scale of the organization and the complexity of personnel, of course, every staff member, especially the person in charge, needs to express an entrepreneurial spirit. First, there must be an unwavering spirit of striving for success; second, there must be an ambition to benefit the people and benefit the country; third, there must be a merit that lasts for a long time; fourth, there must be a method of adapting to the environment at any time.</p>
<p>We also sincerely offer "entrepreneurial spirit" to encourage ourselves and others, especially hoping that political leaders, social leaders, industrial leaders, and other leaders who have leadership responsibilities and play a model role, will pay special attention to it. The achievements of national and social undertakings in wartime rely on it!</p>
<h3>New Treaty Between Japan and Burma Formally Signed in Rangoon; Shan State and Karenni States Incorporated into Burmese Territory</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - After declaring independence on August 1st, Burma decided on the basic policies for nation-building, embarked on the path of war and construction in accordance with these policies, and actively strengthened the wartime system at home to consolidate the position of an independent nation. Today, a new treaty was concluded between Japan and Burma in Rangoon on the 25th. According to this treaty, Shan State and Karenni States, as well as the Wa region, will be incorporated into Burmese territory. The area of the above-mentioned regions is about one-third of the territory of Burma proper, and the majesty of the new Burma will be further strengthened. This new agreement was formally signed by Burmese Prime Minister Ba Maw and Japanese Ambassador to Burma, Sawada, at 4:30 p.m. in the Burmese government auditorium. Those attending the ceremony on the Burmese side included Deputy Prime Minister Thakin Mya, Foreign Minister U Thein Nu, as well as the presidents and vice-presidents of the Privy Council and representatives of the indigenous peoples of Shan State and Karenni States. On the Japanese side were Consul-General Shimazu, rural Lt. General Naka, military attachés, and embassy staff. After the signing, Ambassador Sawada delivered a speech, and Prime Minister Ba Maw delivered a reply. The ceremony was then completed. As a result, Shan State, Karenni State, and the Wa region will abolish military administration this year and be directly under the jurisdiction of the Burmese government. Therefore, Burma will incorporate 46,950 square miles of territory. When Burma was independent, the area of its territory was 171,157 square miles. After the incorporation of these three places, it has increased to 218,107 square miles. The distance from north to south is 1,300 miles, and the distance from east to west is blank miles. The area of its territory ranks fourth among the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere countries. The population was previously more than 15 million, and with the addition of the newly incorporated territory, the residents are now about 16.6 million. The incorporation of Shan State into Burmese territory has the following important significance: The new territory has been completely separated from Burma for more than 50 years since the British conquered Burma. Now, it is incorporated into Burmese territory, and the east will be merged. Shan State has important resources such as minerals and timber. After being incorporated into Burmese territory, it will enhance Burma's national power in terms of economy, and it will also be beneficial to the development of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. After the people of Shan State and Karenni people are incorporated into Burma, the Burmese spirit of nation-building and the harmony of the nation have become the expected conditions. At the same time, Prime Minister Ba Maw's previously announced basic national policy for Burma can strengthen the foundation for establishing national mobilization. In the military aspect, it completes the geographical defense system of Burma against the Chongqing army in the north. Due to the unity of the Burmese nation, the promotion of national spirit, and the cooperation with Japan and its allies, Burma's determination to fight has entered a decisive stage.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Sawada's Congratulatory Remarks</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Burma Sawada, after the signing of the Japan-Burma treaty, addressed Burmese national representative Prime Minister Ba Maw, saying: The treaty concluded between Japan and Burma this time incorporates all states of Shan State (excluding Kengtung and Mong Pan) and the Wa region into Burmese territory. The treaty has been signed by Burmese Prime Minister Ba Maw and Ambassador blank. Today is the day for Burma to celebrate its independence. It can be said that the signing of this meaningful treaty is a celebration with Heaven. This treaty is a manifestation of Japan's policy of righteousness based on the great ideal of creating a nation, with the goal of liberating East Asia and building a new world order. In order to complete Burma's independence, Japan not only provides all cooperation and support, but also signs this treaty in this spirit. Burma has been poisoned by the British policy of ethnic discord under British rule for the past half century. Now, after incorporating the new territory, all ethnic groups in Burma have become a natural entity. This move can be described as icing on the cake for Burma's independence, which is truly commendable. Therefore, this treaty is a pivotal point for promoting the unity between Japan and Burma. I deeply hope that the two countries will strengthen their mutual cooperation in the future and move forward with blank to complete the common war.</p>
<h3>Analysis of Soviet War Power (1) Translated from Allied World Weekly, No. 1223</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The unprecedented two-year-long German-Soviet war on the battlefields has now entered a critical juncture. Although the second winter counteroffensive of the Soviet army, which began on November 19th last year, suffered great losses in personnel and equipment, the Soviet army almost completely regained the territories lost in the German army's major offensive in the summer of last year. Moreover, the "Stalingrad Drama" was embellished in the middle, making Germany feel that it was really necessary to re-examine the Soviet war power. German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels recently wrote an article for a certain newspaper, saying: "At that time, Germany was in a state of near despair. Wasn't the autumn when the Soviet Union invaded the German mainland imminent! We all felt this impression deeply." He frankly admitted that Germany was in a major crisis of air in the winter war.</p>
<p>From Summer to Winter</p>
<p>However, Hitler's brave and decisive operations took effect. The German-Soviet winter war temporarily came to an end in late March. Germany's war situation was stabilized again. After that, the German and Soviet armies engaged in local positional battles. Although the German authorities repeatedly warned that the Soviet army's so-called "summer offensive" was about to begin, neutral blank and even the United Kingdom and the United States believed that the Soviet army, which had suffered heavy losses in personnel and equipment in the winter counteroffensive, would break the usual practice and start the summer offensive on its own. It was impossible.</p>
<p>In fact, the German-Soviet war is a kind of seesaw battle. In the summer, the German army took the offensive, and in the winter, the Soviet Union counterattacked. Because of the previous concept, it did not break the balance of the seesaw by the Soviet army and started the so-called summer offensive.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Breaks the Balance</p>
<p>Regarding the Soviet army's war power, Germany already needed to re-examine it. However, the Soviet army's offensive, which began at dawn on July 5, also urgently felt the need to re-evaluate the Soviet Union's resistance force within the anti-Axis line. In short, the fact that the Soviet army broke the previous balance and began to attack in the summer is worth caring about. As the history of war says, no matter what the method of close combat is, the party that takes the offensive, that is, the party that secures the initiative of the war, occupies an advantageous position.</p>
<p>Since the start of the German-Soviet summer war, the President's Headquarters has issued daily communiqués stating that the Soviet army has suffered extremely heavy losses in manpower and equipment, but has ultimately recaptured Orel, Belgorod, and Bryansk, Kalathof, and its sharp edge is difficult to resist. The encirclement of Smolensk, the most important point on the central front, is also a matter of concern for the German army.</p>
<p>The Center of Gravity is Still on the Eastern Front</p>
<p>On the day when the Anti-Axis Forces opened the Second Front in Europe, the Eastern Front remained the main battlefield for the German army. Even if the Second Front in Europe was opened, the German army could not but carry out two-front operations. The Eastern Front is still the main front, with a decisive impact.</p>
<p>Let us try to examine the Soviet Union's movements in terms of military, political, and diplomatic aspects in order. Needless to say, the Soviet Union's movements are blank by the Soviet Union's war power. It is almost impossible. Only the essential aspects are presented for examination.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Implement Experiment Factory Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday; Director Chen Made a New Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - In order to increase production and improve agricultural cultivation, the National Government has established an agricultural implement manufacturing experiment blank in Wuxi. The factory is concurrently headed by Minister of Industry Chen Jun blank.

<h3>Ba Maw's Representative Thanked for Assistance</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - When the Japan-Burma territorial treaty was signed, Burmese national representative Ba Maw delivered a reply, the main idea of which was that the Japan-Burma territorial treaty concluded today stipulates that blank Shan State (excluding Kengtung and Mong Pan) and Karenni State and the Wa region will be incorporated into Burmese territory. This will not only benefit the unity of Burma, but also make a great contribution to the strengthening of the East Asia blank order and the western region of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The unity between Japan and Burma and the countries of East Asia will inevitably become closer because of this. The various states of Shan, Karenni and the Wa region mostly belong to Burma and constitute the main part of Burma, but because Burma lost the war in the Anglo-Burmese War, it was forced to cede it to Britain. The British rule of the states did not take into account their welfare and interests at all, and all means were used to provoke them as much as possible. In order to extend its power, Britain tried its best to prevent the development of Guizhou. This kind of pollution point can now be eliminated due to the kindness and assistance of Japan. We are deeply grateful for this. Shan, Karenni, and Wa are now fulfilling their due obligations based on the common destiny of the country. I am convinced that under one command and one voice, we can unite and achieve the final victory.</p>

The current stage of the Greater East Asia War is the decisive battle in the air, and there are three main points that should be considered in the current air combat situation: The first is the northern Aleutian and Kuril Islands; the second is between Burma and the Chongqing resistance area; and the third is the southwestern Pacific region. The Japanese army has achieved great results since the operation to destroy the American air force stationed in Chongqing began in late July, and the plan to break the enemy's counteroffensive is still in progress.

<p>The industry associations attending the congress included: Iron and Steel Industry, Banking Industry, Money Exchange Industry, Cotton Mill Industry, Timber Industry, Gold Industry, Enamel Industry, Bicycle Industry, Insurance Industry, Straw Braid Hat Material Industry, Hot Water Industry, Cotton Fluffing Industry, Cut Noodle Industry, Pancake and Mantou Oil Braising Shop Industry, Silverware Industry, Straw Felt Hat Industry, Stationery and Instrument Industry, Book Industry, Fur Industry, Fourth Clothing Industry, Letterpress Printing Industry, Coal and Charcoal Industry, Coarse and Fine Pigment Sundry Goods Industry, Pharmaceutical Factory Industry, New Medicine Industry, Coal Ball Industry, Cloth Shop Industry, Coal Shop Industry, Silk and Satin Shop Industry, Silk Shop Industry, Silk Weaving Factory Industry, Cloth Factory Industry, Tea Food Industry, Miscellaneous Grain Industry, Animal Husbandry Industry, Seafood Sundry Goods Industry, Tobacco Factory Industry, totaling 128 units with 340 representatives.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Yuan Lvdeng, Chairman of the Presidium, delivered the opening address, saying: "Today is the annual members' congress of the City Chamber of Commerce. Recalling the restoration of this association, more than a year has passed. According to the regulations, the annual members' congress should have been convened in June of this year, but because at that time, various industry associations were ordered to reorganize and merge one after another, it was impossible to convene it, so it was delayed until today. Recalling this year, it coincides with the period of the Greater East Asia War. Under this extraordinary situation, everything is in turmoil. The first to bear the brunt is naturally industry and commerce. The decline of industry and the desolation of commerce are naturally no exception. What is hoped is that this is a temporary abnormal phenomenon, and we look forward to the arrival of permanent brightness. Also, in this autumn of industrial and commercial difficulties, this association, in this environment, has tried to do its best to alleviate the pain of industry and commerce, but we are ashamed that the effect is very small, and we regret it. However, this association has always adhered to a steady position, earnestly guarding itself, and has always taken the interests of industry and commerce as the premise. This is what we can say with a clear conscience, and we can also comfort the members. However, in the world, if you do not advance, you will retreat. We review the past, examine the present, and think about the future, walking on thin ice, deeply fearful. Under this environment, how should this association promote its affairs and improve the current situation? These are all major issues that should be viewed from a long-term perspective. Lvdeng is incompetent and would like to hear your wise teachings."</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>The discussion of proposals then commenced. The Silk Shop Industry, Silk and Satin Shop Industry, and Silk Weaving Factory Industry jointly proposed: Silk and silk products should be allowed to be freely transported within the area of three provinces and two cities in accordance with the law. The order of the Shanghai Economic Bureau stipulates that the movement of major commodities in this city should be submitted to the bureau for approval and issuance of permits, which conflicts with the law. It should be reported to the ministry for correction. It was resolved to report to the ministry for correction. The Cloth Factory Industry Association proposed that yarn and cloth are related to all industries. Because the government has explicitly ordered the purchase of banknote cloth, the turnover of funds is not working, and the reconciliation mechanism is on the verge of bankruptcy. It is proposed to forward the request to the authorities for relief and to allow the special fixed-term deposit certificates for the price of yarn and cloth to be discounted in order to maintain operations. It was resolved that the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce would submit a report in the name of the congress to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, to state the difficult situation of various industries after the purchase of yarn and cloth, and to request financial relief and permission to discount the special fixed-term deposit certificates for the price of yarn and cloth without interest, and to pray for instructions to be followed. The Tea Food Industry, Soda and Fruit Juice Manufacturing Industry, and Candied Fruit Industry jointly requested that the association needs to use sugar for various products. In the past, there was still inventory to barely maintain operations, but in recent months, the inventory has been exhausted, and the allocated quantity has been reduced. As for the tea food industry and the candied fruit industry, although they have applied for allocation, they have not been approved, so the source of raw materials is severely lacking. They request that the Shanghai allocation agencies be asked to provide as much sugar as possible to avoid difficulties in production. It was resolved to hand it over to the board of directors for handling. Jiu Chunxin proposed: It is found that the allocation of raw materials for coal balls to various factories is decreasing month by month, and it is even worse this winter. The reason is that transportation on various roads is difficult. Can it be requested that the Standing Bureau designate Shanghai coal ball raw materials as an item to be transported as soon as possible, and order all roads to comply, so as to stabilize people's livelihood, and for the authorities to find ways to purchase foreign coal to increase reserves and avoid panic? It was resolved to be paid to the public for a decision. It was resolved that the association would request the authorities to do so. Wu Xiaohou proposed to initiate the organization of a national chamber of commerce federation. It was resolved to be retained. Temporary motions: Representatives from the Cotton Fluffing Industry and the Pancake and Mantou Oil Braising Shop Industry all requested to negotiate for the allocation of raw materials. It was resolved that a written report must be submitted for verification.</p>
<h3>Encourage Reporting of Hoarding; Reserve Huge Sum of Bonus; Considerable Imports of Canned Food; But Market Prices Have Risen to Their Peak</h3>
<p>Currently, the main foods in this city that have not yet implemented per capita distribution are as important as soap and matches, and it is urgent to implement control. For example, canned foods and other foods have already raised prices to the highest point, and citizens have no intention of buying them. Although the import of canned food is still considerable during this period, as a result of the activities of hoarders, it has recently risen by 200% to 300%. As for the vegetable market, the public also hopes that the Standing Bureau will pay attention. According to the reporter of the Times, in order to implement more advanced sanctions against hoarders of major items, the authorities have recently decided to reserve huge sums of rewards to encourage all citizens who secretly report hoarders. It is found that the decision of this method was decided at the Materials Investigation Committee held at the racecourse on Friday. The committee also agreed on a method of punishing those who have not registered yarn and cloth.</p>
<h3>Thrift Movement Meeting Established Today; Citizens Welcome to Participate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens Thrift Movement Meeting will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Association at 3:30 PM today.

<h3>Household Oil Sales in District 1 End Tomorrow; Oil Sales in District 4 Started Yesterday</h3>
<p>District 1 of this city, after District 8 started selling the fifth phase of household oil on the 19th of this month, will end sales tomorrow (28th).

<h3>Police Officers Receiving Training Should Not Avoid It</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Interior, in order to improve the quality of cadres and police officers in various places, and to strengthen the maintenance of local public security forces, has successively held various training courses for implementation. The Second Police Bureau of the city found that once the police officers of its subordinate sub-bureaus were transferred, they often tried to avoid it by seeking help and making excuses. If they were not strictly prohibited, it would not only waste the country's money, but also in the long run, the available people would not be available. It should be eradicated. In the future, if anyone dares to deliberately evade, or seek opportunities, they will be dismissed and demoted. Yesterday, a special order was issued to all subordinates to comply.</p>
<h3>The Confucius Society Prints Images of Confucius</h3>
<p>The Chinese Confucius Society?

It has now entrusted the Commercial Press, China Book Company, World Book Company, Yongxiang Printing Company, and other companies to sell them on consignment for five yuan each.</p>
<h3>Allocate Household Sugar; Maintain with All Efforts; Order Huge Amount of Taiwan Sugar to be Shipped to Shanghai for Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, in order to maintain sugar supply, after handling household sugar and special allocations for various industries, recently requested the military allocation authorities to dredge the source and supply it on a monthly basis. In view of the importance of household sugar, it will do its best to maintain the allocation of household sugar. As for the special allocations required for the business of various industries, it will be increased again once the sugar reserves are abundant. It is also heard that the military allocation authorities have ordered a huge amount of Taiwan sugar to be shipped to Shanghai for relief, and at the same time, they are trying to load the sugar stored in the Philippines onto ships and transport it to Shanghai, so there is no panic about the supply of sugar in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Third Anniversary of the Tripartite Pact Between Japan, Germany, and Italy; Talk by Information Minister Hirota</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: The 27th of this month is the third anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy. Information Minister Kyoda of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai issued the following statement:</p>
<p>"The Tripartite Pact was concluded on September 27, Showa 13 (1938), which was one year after the outbreak of the European War. One year after the conclusion, the Greater East Asia War broke out again. On December 11 of the same year, the additional agreement of the Tripartite Pact was issued, and the character of the Tripartite Pact was changed from a political alliance to a military alliance. The decisive determination to build a new world order was fully understood. Now that the third anniversary has been reached, one of the contracting parties, Italy, has withdrawn due to violating the treaty. The core of the alliance is now Japan and Germany. However, in addition to Japan and Germany, there are several countries that have joined this treaty. Under the strong cooperation, they continue to fight. Such breach of faith is only a test in the Axis camp and does not cause any pain or disadvantage. This can be seen from the joint statement issued by the Japanese and German governments on September 15.</p>
<p>The joint statement of Japan and Germany stated that "the breach of faith of the Badoglio government has no effect on the Tripartite Pact, and the effectiveness of the treaty has not changed in any way. The government of the Great Japanese Empire and the government of Great Germany jointly have the determination to make every effort to carry out this war until the final victory is achieved." Before achieving the final victory in this war, the unity of the Axis countries will become even closer. Because of Badoglio's breach of faith, the Italian people temporarily lost their combat reputation. However, the two peoples are now starting to regenerate under new political efforts. We also hope that they will achieve results soon.</p>
<p>Building a new world order is by no means easy. It must have a strong will. Those who are weak-willed and opportunistic are not enough to talk with. The war purpose of the Axis countries, in other words, is to liberate freedom and people's livelihood. The purpose of the anti-Axis countries is to complete the outdated world domination ambition of Britain and the United States and the maintenance of the status quo obtained by ambition in the past, and the expansion of financial power. They plan that after the war, all air routes in the world must be exclusively occupied by American planes, and maritime efforts must be controlled by Britain and the United States. All financial organizations are managed by the financial consortiums of Britain and the United States. From this, it can be seen that their sole purpose is to dominate the world, but to oppress all the nations of the world to be their subordinates. For this point, in particular, Chinese people of insight must review the past history and think about it.</p>
<p>At present, the world war has been transformed into an offensive and defensive war in history, and it has evolved into a long-term war. I believe that the number of people in the world who understand the concept of this Tripartite Pact and the war purpose of the Axis army is increasing day by day. It is clear whether the Tripartite Pact will bring light to the development of mankind and whether the treacherous Anglo-American alliance can bring happiness to mankind. As the countries of the Tripartite Pact are now entering the fourth year of conclusion, they are determined to face the profound trials that will be encountered in the future. Hereby, for the third time, we declare that we will never stop until the final victory is achieved in this holy war aimed at saving the people of the world. Goodness will overcome all difficulties and be carried through to the end. It is firmly believed that the connection between the contracting countries of the alliance will become more solid and consolidated."</p>

<h3>Destroyer on Bella Bay Smashes Enemy Submarine, Establishes Great Achievement; Adopts Ramming Tactics to Rescue Allied Vessel</h3>
<p>Before dawn on August 2nd, on Bella Bay in the waters surrounding Kolombangara Island, the site of fierce battles in the central Solomon Islands, an enemy high-speed torpedo boat was destroyed with a violent ramming attack, splitting it in two before sinking it. This unprecedented martial skill of our destroyer far exceeds common naval warfare knowledge and is an unparalleled heroic feat in world naval history. The unparalleled bravery of this vessel not only strikes fear into the hearts of the enemy but also significantly boosts our side's morale.</p>
<p>A Daring Assault</p>
<p>In the waters off Kolombangara Island, our mine warfare squadron operates with great elusiveness and activity, constantly threatening the enemy. The enemy, attempting to hinder our operations and possessing numerical superiority, relentlessly bombs from the air. Simultaneously, when the sea is calm, they continuously deploy torpedo boats in batches, weaving a seamless net in the air and on the sea to counter our attacking vessels. This is the current situation. To charge head-on under these circumstances, dedicatedly covering our transportation and cutting off the enemy's resupply, is like rushing into a prepared gauntlet of enemy gunfire, repeatedly demonstrating a truly daring assault. The miracle performed by Destroyer 〇〇 was not an accidental stroke of luck. It was like abandoning a slashing sword to rescue an allied vessel in dire straits, a strategic move that turned a desperate situation into victory. The following is an account of the battle from Commander 〇〇, who directed the ramming tactics from the destroyer that achieved this great feat.</p>
<p>Sinking Enemy Boat with Allied Vessel</p>
<p>On the night before the incident, the first of August, Destroyer 〇〇 was carrying out a certain mission, carefully covering several allied vessels, sailing south on Bella Bay. While en route, six enemy torpedo boats preparing to engage were suddenly spotted. To preemptively strike, it joined forces with the allied vessels in a fierce attack from multiple directions. Our side unleashed a dense rain of intense gunfire, quickly sinking two enemy boats, disabling one with heavy artillery, and scattering the others. Before long, our vessel entered the anchorage of Kolombangara Island. After the mission concluded, at 00:00 on the second, it formed a line and set out on its return journey.</p>
<p>On the Dark Sea Surface</p>
<p>Sailing north on the sea near Kolombangara Island, 〇〇 served as a perimeter guard, following behind the allied vessels. At this time, the Commander had already anticipated that the enemy torpedo boats that had escaped the previous day would surely be lying in ambush somewhere, seeking revenge. All crew members were at their stations, paying close attention and maintaining vigilance. On the dark sea surface, leaving a trail of white wake, they swiftly sailed north. Although the weather wasn't ideal, the moonless sea was pitch black, completely enveloped in darkness, making visibility extremely poor. Just as the squadron was observing the shadow of Kolombangara Island on the right, a lookout on the left suddenly shouted urgently, "Torpedo boats ahead on the port side!" The Commander, Captain, and others standing on the bridge could see with their own eyes that three dark shapes were heading straight for the allied vessels on the ship's port bow.</p>
<p>Rush to Save Allied Vessel</p>
<p>The distance was only 〇〇 meters, making it too late to open fire. If the unsuspecting allied vessels were hit by torpedoes, they would be in serious trouble. In that instant, Commander 〇〇 made a decision, and everyone tacitly understood the Captain's only option: ramming. They would sacrifice themselves to save the 〇 allied vessels.</p>
<p>"Ram them!" This unprecedented command in modern naval warfare was issued. With full power, our destroyer charged towards the nearest torpedo boat. Watching the dark shape of the enemy torpedo boat rushing past in front, the razor-sharp hull of the destroyer cut through it in an instant. The screeching sound of the impact shook everyone. Immediately afterwards, on the left side of number one turret, it suddenly felt as if a fire had started. Oily smoke fell towards the bridge, splashing on the faces of the Commander and others like drizzle. Hitting a torpedo boat felt like hitting a torpedo.</p>
<p>"Was it a torpedo explosion?" Initially, they thought they had rammed the wrong target. But shortly afterwards, they saw two large fireballs burning and passing to the side, flowing to the rear. This was because the destroyer's hull had severed the enemy torpedo boat in two at the engine compartment. The piece flowing on the right side immediately disappeared from sight, but the piece flowing on the port side suddenly reappeared as another torpedo boat amidst the flames.</p>
<p>Renewed Fierce Bombardment</p>
<p>Destroyer 〇〇 promptly subjected it to another intense bombardment. Perhaps seeing that the severed torpedo boat was beyond saving, it braved the rain of bullets and vanished into the sea. This was like drawing a sword to cut down an enemy. Another strike in a mountain-pressing-down manner, it could be said to be as sharp as a Japanese sword. The other one also disappeared at some point. Destroyer 〇〇 only sustained a superficial cut on the bow, which did not affect its speed in any way. The 〇 allied vessels advanced northward in an orderly and imposing manner. The destroyer, chasing behind the allied vessels, gradually left the battlefield.</p>
<p>Being able to smash the enemy before they could launch their torpedoes and prevent any damage to the allied vessels can be considered the best strategy.</p>
<p>Regarding his determination to self-detonate and the tragic state of mind when ramming the enemy torpedo boat, the Commander only said one sentence, "I wanted to keep fighting." (Translated from the September 11th edition of the Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Heroic Tales of Bloodshed in the South Pacific</h3>
<p>The decisive battle between Japan and the United States centered around New Georgia in the Solomon Islands intensifies day and night. Our valiant garrison forces, enduring relentless attacks by the enemy from land, sea, and air, face hardships that defy description. On July 14th, under the cover of U.S. fast warships and fighter planes, seventy landing craft launched a major offensive from the sea towards the eastern side of Munda. Our defending forces immediately sank twenty of them. Simultaneously, to coordinate with the operation, 500 enemy soldiers attacking from the land were also driven into the water, becoming food for the fishes. Below is an account of this heroic battle.</p>
<h3>Munda Garrison</h3>
<p>The position of the Shimizu Unit (led by Lieutenant Saburo Shimizu), part of the 〇〇 unit stationed at the Kiyomizu Heights in front of Munda, New Georgia Island, had been subjected to continuous enemy shelling. A forest area that had never been felled by axes in thousands of years was reduced to a scorched earth devoid of even small trees. On July 12th, the Shimizu unit, which had been engaging small enemy detachments, anticipated that the enemy would attempt a landing from the direction of nearby Rubiana Island, given the continuous enemy shelling. Therefore, they moved their position to the east coast of Munda.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Masao Kuramoto's artillery unit also positioned all of its artillery on the coast, preparing to fight alongside the Shimizu unit. On the third day after the position was moved to the coast (July 14th), the weather was very clear, allowing a view of Rubiana Island floating on the blue sea 3,000 meters away.</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM, Unit Commander Shimizu received a report that the enemy, under the cover of fighter planes and fast warships, was approaching Munda with seventy landing craft. He and artillery unit commander Kuramoto decided to use artillery and machine guns to engage the enemy ships coming from the sea and rifles to engage the 500 enemy soldiers coming from the land.</p>
<p>When the enemy's seventy-odd boats sailed within 700 meters of our forces, Commanders Kuramoto and Shimizu simultaneously shouted, "Fire!" The gunners, who had been ready, opened fire all at once. Several enemy boats and frantic soldiers disappeared into the sea together. The enemy boats, relying on their numerical superiority, returned fire with artillery. Their shells were very accurate. When we fired forty or fifty shells, the enemy began to change direction and flee. The enemy boats were in utter chaos amidst the splashes of water, the smoke from artillery fire, and the smoke screens they released. Our gun barrels became completely red-hot, and the soldiers, with their faces covered in the red blood splattered from enemy shells, became even more spirited.</p>
<p>Seeing this miserable situation, the enemy soldiers coming from the land, though already terrified, still rapidly approached our position. Our infantry unit then concentrated their firepower on the American soldiers. The enemy was completely surrounded by our intense hail of fire and suffered heavy losses. Our Imperial troops seized this opportunity, fixed bayonets, and, thinking "Damn it, these American bastards!", charged towards the American soldiers. The enemy, crying out in misery, began to retreat.</p>
<p>Seeing that our troops were engaged in melee combat with their infantry, the enemy fighter planes were unable to carry out machine-gun strafing. The fierce battle on land and sea continued for half an hour and then stopped.</p>
<p>In this fierce battle, twenty enemy boats were sunk, and over 1,500 enemy soldiers were killed in action on land and sea. Our side only suffered 15 killed in action and 5 wounded, and only one gun carriage was damaged among the 〇〇 artillery pieces.</p>
<h3>The Seven Scouts of Salamaua</h3>
<p>The fierce battles near Salamaua, New Guinea, are no less intense than those in the Solomon Islands. The following is a story of seven courageous officer scouts who routed a small enemy unit, gathered intelligence, and raided a mortar position, capturing two mortars and returning.</p>
<p>The enemy forces in front of Logahun Heights in Salamaua were advancing towards the coastline day by day, and were quietly preparing to land with landing craft. The commander of our forces stationed at Logahun Heights decided to deliver a blow to the enemy before they were fully prepared. Prior to a general assault, it was decided to select seven scouts led by Lieutenant Kaichi Hirayama: Sergeant Tanaka Kurata, Corporal Otsuka, Private First Class Tsubonotani, Private Mashiko, Private Tanida, and Private First Class Nagayama.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of [Date Omitted], the scout team, carrying two light machine guns, two captured automatic rifles, two rifles, multiple hand grenades, and two days' worth of rations, set out. Around noon, as the Hirayama scout team advanced through the forest near a valley, they suddenly heard American soldiers speaking. Five enemy signalmen were resting. Private Tanida quietly advanced and wiped them all out with a burst from a machine gun. As the sun was setting, the scout team, having circled behind the enemy's right flank, discovered about 500 enemy soldiers camping on the beach in front of Logahun Heights.</p>
<p>At approximately 8:00 AM the next morning, while descending a steep slope into a valley, they spotted a mortar position constructed by the enemy. There were two mortars set up, and upon closer inspection, twenty enemy soldiers were guarding the area. Lieutenant Hirayama smiled and said, "Let's take it." The seven men crept through the forest and reached within twenty meters of the mortar position without being detected by the enemy. The seven men suddenly opened fire with machine guns and automatic rifles, and the enemy soldiers, startled by the gunfire, panicked and fled to the rear. However, seeing that there were only a few of us, they stopped and returned fire with automatic rifles and grenade launchers. Sergeant Kurata and Private First Class Nagayama bravely charged towards the enemy, intending to engage in sword combat. At that moment, the daring Lieutenant Hirayama ran into the enemy position and dragged an enemy mortar away. Seeing the enemy soldiers in disarray, the lieutenant ran back and dragged the other mortar away as well.</p>
<p>During this time, his subordinates had nearly wiped out all the enemy soldiers. Lieutenant Hirayama ordered, "Kurata, Otsuka! Carry the mortars!" The two men then dragged a mortar each back into the forest. At that moment, Private First Class Nagayama was struck in the left thigh by an automatic rifle bullet. Blood stained Private First Class Nagayama's uniform red. Private First Class Nagayama said painfully, "Commander! Please don't worry about me!" In a moment, he lost all strength, and with one last cry of "Long live the Emperor!" he died. Lieutenant Hirayama and the other six men sorrowfully parted ways with the body of Private First Class Nagayama and continued their advance. To avenge their fallen comrade, they encountered twelve signalmen and ten liaison soldiers along the way, eliminating them all without leaving a single survivor.</p>
<p>On the evening of the second day, they quietly moved behind the enemy lines, cutting the enemy's telephone lines attached to a fallen tree. They quickly threw hand grenades into the trenches where enemy soldiers were stationed and agilely fled.</p>
<p>The Hirayama scout team carried the two mortars all night, and arrived at their own unit on the morning of the third day. That evening, the 〇〇 unit, based on Lieutenant Hirayama's report, launched a fierce attack on the enemy in front.

<h3>The Old Furnace Worker's Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>July – a day in a hot season.</p>
<p>I stepped into the furnace room, and a wave of intensely hot air rushed at me, causing me to take a step back involuntarily. The cement on the floor and walls seemed about to crack from the heat of the furnace. Entering the room was like running into a fiery pit.</p>
<p>At this time, our old furnace worker, A-Neng, was standing in front of the fire door at the front of the furnace, his strong arms hoisting a bright coal rake, filling the furnace belly with a full load of coal.</p>
<p>Inside the two open fire doors, burning coal chunks emitted roaring flames, constantly hissing and crackling. The fiery red flames painted A-Neng's aged and swarthy face with a flush of crimson. After skillfully feeding each fire door with sufficient coal dust, he closed the fire doors, casually tossed the coal rake onto the coal pile behind him, and came over. He sat down at one end of a long bench near me, pulled a dark and dirty towel from his shoulder, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and exhaled a long, deep breath, like a sigh and a pant.</p>
<p>Instinctively, I cast an inquisitive gaze upon his face, and I felt that it was still a rather ugly face! The aged and withered face was covered with a thin layer of coal dust, its color reminding one of the hazy twilight. The forehead and face were covered with deep wrinkles, etched by the grinding of "life", further coated with a greasy mixture of sweat and coal dust, like the tracks of a cartwheel after being run over in the rain. Buried within the deeply sunken eye sockets were two listless eyeballs, revealing a glimmer of despair and bewilderment. This was an ugly, coarse, painful face, the face of an elderly laborer. Seeing him sweating and panting, I asked him with concern:</p>
<p>"A-Neng! It's very hot, isn't it!"</p>
<p>"Mmm! Very hot," he raised his head.</p>
<p>"Are you feeling weak?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Mr. Ling! No! I'm still alright! But... as the years pass, people age, and when you get old, you lose your strength." His tone was filled with a melancholy sentiment, mixed with a hint of gratitude for my concern.</p>
<p>He lowered his head again.</p>
<p>"Then, how old are you now?"</p>
<p>"Fifty-three years old, ah!"</p>
<p>"Mmm! You are getting old! How long have you been a furnace worker?"</p>
<p>"Probably... nearly thirty years, I guess!" He spoke like someone awakened from a dream, trying to trace the remnants of the dream, his eyes gazing at the roof, counting on his fingers.</p>
<p>"Ah! Already thirty years!" My expression revealed surprise, and also a hint of lament.</p>
<p>"That's right! It's been thirty years. Most of my life has been burned away by the flames in this furnace..." His tone was somewhat agitated, as if regretting lost youth and lamenting the cruelty of reality. I seemed to see the elderly man's old heart trembling. Before I could interject, he continued, his tone even more agitated, sounding unlike an elderly man:</p>
<p>"The fate of us poor people is destined to suffer. Although, when I was young, I had ideals just like other young people. I created many beautiful illusions. In the furnace fire, I even built an imaginary paradise. I earnestly hoped for its realization, year after year, working hard and waiting with hope. But: thirty years have passed, and cruel reality has shattered my beautiful illusions and imaginary paradise. I even prayed to God, but: He did not give me any real strength. Now I am in despair. I let my remaining years gradually erode and diminish in the flames, until the end of my entire life. I understand very well that we poor people will never be happy, and will never see any light." I saw his aged, swarthy face convulsing in pain, and a surge of emotions that he could not express in words flashed in his eyes. I knew that emotion was violently battering his old heart.</p>
<p>"Don't despair. For every bit of effort you put in, you will gain a bit of reward. Poor people are not entirely without happiness, without hope," I said to him, both comforting and encouraging.</p>
<p>"Huh! For every bit of effort you put in, you can gain a bit of reward. Isn't that just a deceptive saying? For thirty years, I have put in no less effort, but what has been the reward? Am I not still being tormented by life? I can't even support my wife and children, and I have to make them use their own strength to support themselves!" His resentful tone dragged on with bitterness.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but lower my head beside him, taking a deep look at the old furnace worker shrouded in deep shadows, and a wave of sympathy surged in my heart. I felt that the surrounding air was exceptionally cold, no longer fiery. I silently lowered my head. We both fell into silence.</p>
<p>As I stepped out of the furnace room, that bitter sentiment still vaguely lingered in my ears.</p>
<h3>Twenty Vows</h3>
<p>— Sha Yun</p>
<p>As if ten years of dust,</p>
<p>Accumulated on the edge of a worn hat,</p>
<p>But --</p>
<p>Unveiling the thin film of awareness,</p>
<p>I bid farewell forever to childhood!</p>
<p>May you be ten thousand west winds,</p>
<p>Facing the great ocean of life,</p>
<p>I boldly</p>
<p>Drink up the cup of challenge once more.</p>
<p>With a million degrees of flame, I bathe my</p>
<p>Indomitable ethnic spirit,</p>
<p>An ever-young heart,</p>
<p>I thrust forth my</p>
<p>Iron will!</p>
<h3>Little Tea Boy</h3>
<p>— Situ Qi</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>It was before the first class in the afternoon was about to begin.</p>
<p>"Hey! Where did this little tea boy come from? Haha, taro head, haha..."</p>
<p>"This little imp is quite amusing, like a mud doll."</p>
<p>"………………"</p>
<p>The students in classroom number ten, seeing the newly arrived little tea boy walk past the door yesterday, the more mischievous ones immediately began laughing, making a commotion, and reaching out to touch his somewhat prominent back of the head.</p>
<p>The little tea boy's current task was to deliver thermos bottles to the office.</p>
<p>He encountered the students' teasing, but only turned his purplish-red face red, his large eyes wide, shining with surprised light, and grinning stupidly. This added much amusement to the mischievous group. After he finished his duties, when he passed by outside again, they grabbed him and arbitrarily sought materials for laughter, making a ruckus.</p>
<p>"How old are you, little tea boy?"</p>
<p>"Fourteen years old and already serving society, alas! Amitabha, limitless prospects."</p>
<p>"Haha, but isn't he a little Chongming, can't be wrong, right?"</p>
<p>"Hey! What's your name? Have you studied!"</p>
<p>"A-Xiang? What A-Xiang A-Pan, it's still more practical to call him little tea boy."</p>
<p>"Hahahaha, little tea boy! Little tea boy!..."</p>
<p>The little tea boy was busy answering the questions of the group, so flustered and bewildered that he was at a loss. But thanks entirely to the timely arrival of the Director of Student Affairs, he was freed from the great encirclement. However, it was still the little tea boy whose eyes were still wandering who received a few scoldings.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>After school, the little tea boy was sweeping the classroom. He looked at the many white powder marks on the blackboard, feeling baffled. Except for the character "中" (middle), which he recognized from mahjong tiles, out of curiosity, the little tea boy also wanted to learn to write. He picked up a piece of chalk and copied it on the blackboard in the same way, still holding the broom in his left hand. After a long while, he finally produced a satisfactory character "中" (middle), but nothing else.</p>
<p>Lifting his hand, tilting his head, the little tea boy felt unusually strained. He was about to give up when, coincidentally, two students from classroom number ten, who hadn't gone home yet, walked past outside. The little tea boy remembered them very well. The two of them immediately shouted unconsciously:</p>
<p>"Good ah! Little tea boy is learning to write, haha..."</p>
<p>The little tea boy's face turned red, and he quickly threw away the chalk and bowed his head to sweep the floor.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The next day, the little tea boy was once again being entangled by the mischievous schoolchildren. Even one from classroom number ten ordered him to quickly pour a cup of tea. He immediately earnestly complied, busying himself with finding a cup and so on. Just as the mighty "King Yama" Director of Student Affairs happened to walk by, the student panicked in great fear, urgently whispering:</p>
<p>"Ah, ah ah, no need..."</p>
<p>However, the little tea boy was being toyed with and didn't know what was going on, staring wide-eyed, not understanding what kind of game this was.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>Every night, after the school gates were locked, the little tea boy sat and thought after finishing his tasks, just daydreaming.</p>
<p>"A-Changgen said, they are what middle school students are. Oh, middle school students, that must be so good?" The little tea boy thought. He thought that one first became a middle school student, and then had the status of a young master to order others around.</p>
<p>Therefore, this was his opponent. The little tea boy believed that the young masters' questions or orders must also be as Changgen had instructed: diligent and loyal. Originally, hey, it was master and servant, ah.</p>
<p>Over time, the little tea boy gradually no longer felt that the world had any contradictions, everything was progressing on a natural trajectory.</p>
<h3>Feather Song</h3>
<p>— Cun Ting</p>
<p>One day at the end of last autumn, I strolled in the western Junshan mountains of the ancient city for a whole day. The weather that day wasn't very good, gloomy as if it were about to rain, but my heart was filled with joy.</p>
<p>Standing at the foot of the mountain, I could vaguely see the distant village, light smoke drifting, gradually rising and gradually disappearing. Behind me was a crimson forest, as vibrant as women's vermilion lips; in front of me was a vast expanse of rice paddies, golden waves constantly rolling in the wind. Although it was a long and dreary day, I felt an inexplicable sense of comfort pervading me. In that instant, I felt as if I were the only force in the world, the master of nature!</p>
<p>Lost in deep thought, I pondered the towering, overlapping peaks, the gently flowing rivers… and the place where I stood was the epitome of all mountains and rivers. I rejoiced that I had come to this microcosm of mountains and rivers to be its ruler! So I casually picked up a bird's feather, blew on it, and let it drift with the wind. Watching it soar into the sky, a surge of praise arose in my heart, whispering softly, murmuringly.</p>
<p>"Bless you, I don't know if you were lost from a white dove or a hawk, but I know that in my eyes you are pure white, and you are pure white as you float in the air. Now that you are drifting from my hand, I hope you find a happy ending.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you will fall into the nearby swamp, obediently enduring all filth, darkness; perhaps you will be swept into a vast river, swallowed by a fish, or tossed about in the waves. Perhaps you will rest temporarily on the rice stalks, quietly waiting for the next gale; perhaps you will fall into the flourishing weeds, accepting the embrace of thorns; perhaps you will fly into a sweet spring, or perch on a tall tree.</p>
<p>"But I still want you to fly! Fly with all your might! Float forever in the air. I don't want you to fall on the filthy ground, and I don't want you to linger in the dense clouds. I hope you can break through the shackles and soar straight into the blue sky!"</p>
<p>I almost forgot myself, and only exhaled when I realized I was still standing there.</p>
<p>It was starting to drizzle, and I hurriedly took shelter under a red maple tree. When I looked up again, the feather was already gone.</p>
<h3>Fate</h3>
<p>— Liu Jiali</p>
<p>It's early autumn again, reminding me of a cruel reality I witnessed in my hometown around this time last year.</p>
<p>One afternoon, nearing dusk, I was reading Ba Jin's "Life and Death" in my bedroom when Fangmei suddenly ran in to tell me that the Yu family in front—our neighbors!—had taken in a child bride today, and urged me to go see. Driven by curiosity, I hurriedly put down the book and followed her to the front. As soon as I entered the parlor, it was already crowded with people. Neighbors from all around had come. A pair of red candles were lit on the table in the center, covered with a red felt blanket. A girl of fourteen or fifteen, with two small braids tied up, adorned with some flowers, wearing a flowered cloth jacket, very neat and tidy, with a round face and a pair of dark, sparkling eyes, was quite endearing. Perhaps because she was shy, she kept her head down, her eyes fixed on the pair of red flower-print cloth shoes on her feet, sitting on a small bamboo chair next to the table. "Is this the girl?" I asked Fangmei. "Yes, she's quite pretty," Fangmei smiled and nodded. Many people were making comments, judging her appearance.</p>
<p>Later, I learned something about the girl's background. She—Meilan—was a girl from a nearby village. Due to the death of her parents, she was sold by her distant uncle to the Zhang family in the same village to be a child bride. Less than a year later, the Zhang family's son died, so she was now resold to the Yu family. Meilan had to take care of all the household chores, cooking, laundry, and needlework, always toiling away. When she had free time, she would take care of her five-year-old little uncle. Gradually, she became acquainted with us, sometimes telling us some sad stories. But to avoid reminding her of painful memories, we always comforted her wounded heart with other words.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, three months later, her future husband, the Yu family's fourteen-year-old son, contracted a severe case of typhoid fever. Due to their delay, they didn't call a doctor for treatment early on. By the time the illness became serious, it was too late to save him and he died. Meilan couldn't bear this shock, and she cried out loud. She wasn't grieving the boy's death; he had ignored her when he was alive, and there was no emotional connection between them at all. What she grieved was her future fate. Terrible misfortunes always befell her. She didn't dare think about what the future held. Some malicious curses were gnawing at her wounded heart. Her mother-in-law even cursed her as a "widow star," saying she had brought bad luck and caused her son's death. Even though they had consulted a blind fortune-teller and matched their horoscopes before, they had now forgotten all about it. Meilan could only express the indescribable pain she felt inside through heartbroken weeping.</p>
<p>A week later, we watched as an elderly country woman took Meilan away. Without a doubt, the Yu family had resold her again. She silently followed the old woman, not looking back as she left. I watched her go—this unfortunate, pitiful girl. Who had shattered her fragile heart? Who had caused her to suffer these hardships? Was it fate? Or was it...?</p>
<p>Now it's that time of year again. I feel very sad when I recall this incident. We sympathize with her, we pity her, but we can't help her escape this inhuman life and this unfortunate fate. Even now, I still feel guilty inside. I wonder if she is living safely now. I wish this poor girl eternal well-being! (With gratitude)</p>

<h3>Recent Promotion of Round Gate Ball: Combining Chinese and Western Ball Games Based on Sports Principles</h3>
<p>Round Gate Ball is a newly created ball game invented by Mr. Sun Xucang two years ago. Mr. Qian is an education scholar. He also deeply studies physical education and sports. In addition to guiding basketball and track and field competitions, he invented Round Gate Ball based on sports principles, combining Chinese and Western ball games into one. Since its introduction, it has gradually become popular and has been well received in the sports community. The Popularity Cup Round Gate Ball League will be held soon. Our newspaper has specially invited Mr. Qian to write an article on Round Gate Ball, so that people in the society can read it and better understand the meaning and rules of this new type of ball game.</p>
<h3>Motivation for Creation</h3>
<p>I knew nothing about sports in my life. However, when I was young, I liked to be with the village children and played with small balls all day long. Later, I became interested in football, basketball, and volleyball. After studying at university, I majored in education. I read famous Chinese and foreign books on education and sports theories. I learned that exercise can not only improve physical health, but also improve people's psychology and morality. It is the initial stage of education. Physical education is indispensable to education. Without the skin, what will the hair cling to? Reading and understanding must first have a strong will, perseverance, a healthy body, and a sound mind to be able to speak of reading and understanding. Otherwise, you will get sick before you even read, or die in the evening after hearing the truth, or your mind will be distracted, or your energy will be easily exhausted; or you will not be able to think deeply, or you will not be able to learn widely and inquire carefully. Even if there is a famous teacher, he will not be able to help. I once said that Confucius' disciples, such as Yan Hui's intelligence, Zilu's courage, and Zeng Shen's popularity, were all related to their physical condition. It is a pity that Zhongni did not know the good and bad of personality, and the length of life depends on health maintenance. Otherwise, in addition to the four subjects, if you can also take care of personality and physique, wouldn't Confucianism be even better?</p>
<p>Therefore, physical education is the foundation of education, and the promotion of physical education lies in the popularity of sports. To promote the popularity of sports, we must first arouse the interest of the Chinese people in sports. The sports that are most likely to arouse the interest of the general public are ball games. Ball games have been popular in our country for a long time. In the pre-Qin period, there was Cuju. Liu Xiang's "Separate Records" of the Han Dynasty said: "Cuju was created by the Yellow Emperor, or it originated in the Warring States period. Ancient people used Cuju as a game." The "Biography of General Wei" in the "Historical Records" says: "Crossing the city and trampling," which is annotated as "the current Daqiu." The annotation to the "Biography of Huo Qubing" in the "Book of Han" says: "Cuju is made of leather, filled with fur, and played by kicking." Cuju is interpreted as kicking, which is the game of kicking the ball. In the Song Dynasty, there were more detailed instruments, with wooden posts erected as ball gates, divided into left and right gates, which are closer to modern football. In the Yuan Dynasty, polo was popular, and its scales and claws can often be seen in Yuan Dynasty paintings, which makes people yearn for it. At present, the various ball sports popular in our country are mostly directly from the West, and there are many disagreements with the social conditions of our country, so it is still impossible to make them popular. I once had an article published in the "Sports Weekly," which said:</p>
<p>"There are about four taboos in popular ball sports: first, the fixed position of players, second, the intensification of movements, third, the aristocratic equipment, and fourth, the specialization of skills. The reason why basketball cannot be popularized is that it is specialized in skills. The problem with volleyball is the fixed position. Tennis, polo, water polo, and golf are aristocratic. American football is intense..."</p>
<p>Therefore, I am eager to create a new type of ball game, hoping to meet the interests and environment of the Chinese people. I have been thinking about it for several years, but I have no clue. One day, during the spring holiday, I happened to pass the deserted field at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Route Cardinal Mercier. I saw nearly a hundred children gathered there, some flying kites, some chasing and running, and some watching with their hands in their sleeves. Among them, the game with the most participants and the most enthusiastic was the game of throwing small balls. Most of the participants were elementary school students and street children. The method of the game seems to refer to the rules of basketball and small ball. Throwing, passing, transporting, and throwing are very active. Although the atmosphere is not very tense, it is quite interesting. Because I think that in general schools, although there are sports field facilities, the students who can actually participate in sports are rare. Now the children in this deserted field can find open space by themselves and gather dozens of people to engage in the game of throwing small balls. Isn't this enough to be a research material for educators? After returning to school, I based the game's interest and method on the children of this deserted field, and referred to the etiquette of Cuju in the Song and Yuan Dynasties in our country. I also extracted the essence of basketball, this ball, volleyball, German handball, and water polo, and integrated the rules of the four ball games into one, making its fun as rich as basketball and football, but without the disadvantages of being too intense. After several months of calculation and experimentation, the rules of the round gate ball were completed.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Ball Game</h3>
<p>The round gate ball field is rectangular, slightly larger than a basketball court, and can be used indoors or outdoors. At both ends of the ball field, a round gate is erected. The field is divided into side lines, end lines, center lines, serving lines, and goal area lines with white lines. The number of players in each team is seven. (That is, one goalkeeper, one center back, one left and right full back each, one center forward, and one left and right winger each. The area and number of players in a large ball field are the same as in football.) One of them is responsible for the goalkeeper, and the rest of the players can use their hands and limbs above the knees to pass, pat, and throw the ball in any way. (However, the goalkeeper can use his feet in the goal area) to enter the opponent's gate as the goal. At the same time, the players must closely defend the opponent's players to enter the water team's round gate.</p>
<h3>Significance of the Round Gate</h3>
<p>The ball gates are erected at both ends of the ball field, forming a regular round corner shape, 210 cm high and 360 cm wide, the size is equal to a small football gate. Because players throw the ball with their hands to attack the gate, it is more accurate than using their feet. The ball enters the upper left and right corners of the ball gate. It is most difficult for the goalkeeper to defend. In order to reduce the difficulty of the goalkeeper's defense, and to avoid unrecoverable dangerous saves, and to increase the interest of the competition, the two corners of the ball gate are cut into semi-circular shapes with equal radii. This is the simple meaning of becoming a round gate.</p>
<h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
<p>The rules of the round gate ball are compiled with reference to basketball and football. All actions such as dribbling, patting the ball, throwing the ball, passing the ball, and jumping ball are similar to basketball. The regulations on fouls and fouls are also based on the established rules of double ball. Its penalties, divided into side line ball, corner ball, goal ball, Ren Yu ball, six-meter ball, etc., are similar to football. As for the rules of the goalkeeper and the goal area, it is slightly different from football. Among them, the restrictions on players entering the goal area are the most strict. The goal area is semi-circular. Except for the goalkeeper, any player who enters the goal area line is considered a foul and punished accordingly. Other rules, such as competition officials, competition time, start of competition, suspension and progress, competition terms, victory or defeat, reaches, fouls, free kicks, corner kicks, six-meter balls, etc., are all specially stipulated in the rules, which are detailed and not omitted.</p>
<h3>Results of the Trial Competition</h3>
<p>The game of the round gate ball is as described above. For fear of building a car behind closed doors and not cutting into the real world, a trial competition was held on November 10, 1941. The following is an excerpt from the newspaper's record at the time:</p>
<p>"Since the advent of the round gate ball, people in the sports world have been talking about it. Whether this ball game can be popular all over the world is not to be discussed. Basketball originated in the United States. At first, it was a game of throwing the ball into a wooden bucket. Today, it has become popular in countries all over the world. Even the inventors at the time could not have imagined it. The potential of the round gate ball in the cradle is unlimited. After the news of the round gate ball table spread, many fans came to watch it. At about 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the opening middle school was crowded with people. It was an unprecedented grand occasion in the history of the founding of the country. The founder is also satisfied. The round gate ball has today's harvest, which is worthy of his painstaking research. At 3:00 p.m., the game started, and the blue and white teams first started the ball..."</p>
<p>Since this trial competition, it has been warmly supported by people from all walks of life, and the Western Sports Association has also paid attention to it. The association automatically participated in three Sino-Western confrontations, and the results were very satisfactory. There was also a women's team participating in the performance. The following paragraph is a record of the chapter, which can give a glimpse of one of the grand occasions at that time:</p>
<p>"The round gate ball double heroes friendship match was held at Guangxia Middle School yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. More than 2,000 people came to watch, and the emotions were enthusiastic. Liangyou Bao Songwei Da Shen Dun, Xi Shi said:</p>
<p>All walks of life have held round gate ball leagues, such as the "Guobin Cup," "Chang Cup," and "Middle School Cup," which were very popular for a while.</p>
<h3>Future Development</h3>
<p>The birth of the round fighting ball coincided with the year of the national suffering. The flames of war were everywhere, and transportation was blocked. Even the rules were mostly restricted. In the future, it may be promoted again to make it popular, and often widely consulted and interviewed, gathering opinions and criticisms from all parties to improve it. This requires the support and guidance of advanced people at home and abroad, which cannot be done by sole effort.</p>
<h3>Famous Female Swimmer in East Asia, Yang Xiuqiong, Will Give Up Swimming, The Sports World Hopes That the Mermaid Will Continue to Work Hard</h3>
<p>Ms. Yang Xiuqiong, the mermaid, has been living a family life and has not engaged in swimming since she married the famous jockey Tao Bolin in Xiangdao. It was not until last year that she intended to come to Shanghai, but it was cancelled due to transportation reasons. Now she has arrived in Shanghai on September 11, and the ladies in Shanghai are all happy.</p>
<p>Times Pictorial 1. The new Japanese army active on the southern front. 2. When Chairman Wang arrived in Tokyo on the 22nd to visit Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, the host and guests raised their glasses to congratulate each other (transmitted photo). 3. Japanese military instructors enthusiastically teach flight trainees. 4. On the 20th of this month, the "Air" Commemoration Day, a girl presented flowers to a pilot at the aircraft naming ceremony dedicated by Japanese expatriates. 5. This newspaper held a tea party for the elderly at the Ningbo Township Association during the Mid-Autumn Festival to study health preservation and good deeds. 6. Japanese naval propaganda team instructors guide civilians in gymnastics. 7. The situation when American expatriates boarded the ship before the departure of the third exchange ship of Japanese and American expatriates.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Ms. Yang's whereabouts were kept secret and she avoided seeing guests. She first stayed at the Jinmen Hotel and changed rooms three times before moving to the International Hotel. It was not until 3:00 p.m. on the 21st that she met with people from all walks of life in the Three Provinces Sports Association. Ms. Yang is more plump and lovely than before. She practiced tennis in the association. She also watched the international tennis match yesterday. In order to promote women's swimming in Shenjiang, the Three Provinces Sports Association had long planned to have Ms. Yang perform publicly, but it was recently learned that she has not yet agreed. Some people also said that she has no intention of engaging in swimming again.</p>
<p>Ms. Yang is from Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, and lives in Hong Kong. Her father, Yang Yinan, was the director of the swimming department of the Hong Kong Sports Association. Her mother, Long, her sister, Xiu, and her brother, Changhua, are all good at swimming. Ms. Yang is now twenty-five years old. She started practicing swimming in Hong Kong at the age of twelve. The following summer, she participated in the Hong Kong Cross-Harbor Race and won the women's championship. When Mr. Smith, the world's top swimmer, passed through Hong Kong, he praised her swimming talent. He immediately asked her father to train her, and she finally achieved outstanding results. In the 10th Far Eastern Games, she won all the women's swimming championships. In the 6th National Games, she created a record of one minute and 23 seconds for the 100-foot freestyle and one minute and 37 seconds for the 100-meter backstroke, both of which broke the Far Eastern Games record, and represented China at the 10th World Games held in Berlin. Her glorious history is imprinted in our minds. Ms. Yang is beautiful and good at swimming, so people are used to calling her "a mermaid." After her arrival this time, people in the sports world are eagerly hoping that she will continue to display her great spirit of the past.</p>

<h3>Talking About the Suhuai Football Team</h3>
<p>— Bixian</p>
<p>The Suhuai team, which gathered the elite of Northern Jiangsu, arrived in Shanghai on September 13 and left on the 23rd, staying in Shanghai for ten days. They played four games, winning against the Three Provinces, tying with Lianyi, and losing twice to Donghua. The record is not bad. Now I want to analyze the team:</p>
<p>All the players of the team are quite energetic, which is a typical feature of the Northern School. This is the only thing that is appreciated by the fans in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Talking about its offensive strategy, it completely adopts five forwards in parallel, and rarely uses the two wings. The three forwards advance from the middle to achieve the goal. Unless the opponent's defense is weak, or the position is absolutely inaccurate, there is little hope. We only need to think about it. Donghua only intercepts from the middle, which reduces the team's offensive opportunities. The team's performance on the two wings can be said to be non-existent. After getting the ball, they always want to dribble. As a result, due to qualifications and skills, they all become cakes. Therefore, in terms of offensive power, I think they should train more on using the W-style and triangular offensive methods. The two wings should practice cutting in and heading more. As for the defensive aspect, the center back line, Lao Jiang sits in the center, which does not lose the demeanor of a veteran, and can respond from front to back. Lin and Sun, the two full backs, mark people to people. Because they have enough energy, they can be said to be good. However, when they block the ball, they cannot control it. They just kick it far away, which is considered a matter. They cannot respond to the forwards, and they lose offensive opportunities. This kind of full back is not worth taking. They should practice the ability to control the ball and the foot of the ball's landing point. Let's talk about the guards, the two Lis and one Wang, their skill in marking people is appreciated by general fans, especially in the second game against Donghua, Li Qingyu's dead marking of Lao Jin is particularly wonderful, but there are also many shortcomings. Li Qingyu puts all his energy on Lao Sun, and does not want to take care of Ling Yao at all. So Ling Yao is free and active, causing a lot of labor. Donghua especially uses the two wings, and the victory lies in this. The goalkeeper Gao Chen is a little scared, and he also lacks experience!</p>
<p>In summary, the team has enough physical strength and energy. If they are given good training and more opportunities to compete, they can become a good team. They have left this time, and I hope they will come again in the future and give us a better performance.</p>
<p>My humble opinion, I hope those who know me will teach me!</p>
<h3>Simple Fitness Training Methods (3)</h3>
<p>— Written by Tom, Translated by Yide</p>
<p>12. Back Breathing</p>
<p>Stand upright in the correct posture, with your chest automatically raised. Place your thumbs on both sides of the base of the spine and press firmly. Slowly inhale a deep breath through your nostrils. At the beginning of inhalation, you will feel a kind of outward movement resisting the thumbs.</p>
<p>Back Breathing: Place your hands on your waist; inhale, resist diaphragm movement, and exhale slowly.</p>
<p>Note: Practice in class, three breaths are enough; practice individually, you can use your own judgment.</p>
<p>Back Breathing</p>
<p>13. Belt Breathing</p>
<p>Combining abdominal breathing, intercostal breathing, and back breathing into one is called belt breathing.</p>
<p>Stand upright in the correct posture, with your chest raised. Place your hands on your waist, stretching your fingers as far as possible. Slowly inhale deeply through your nostrils. When you start inhaling, you will feel your waist expanding, imagining a flexible belt around your waist. Try to expand it equally on the left, right, front, and back. Practice the three types of breathing separately, with the same number of breaths. Belt breathing should be the normal breathing method, so that you can feel more powerful.</p>
<p>Belt Breathing: Place your hands on your waist; inhale; resist diaphragm movement; exhale slowly.</p>
<p>Note: Practice in class, three breaths are enough; practice individually, you can use your own judgment.</p>
<p>14. Chest Expansion</p>
<p>With your arms at your sides, as shown in the picture. Slowly raise your hands upward and forward until they are higher than your face, then bring your hands together, palms facing your face, little fingers touching.</p>
<p>Raise your elbows (do not raise your hands together) until the tips of your middle fingers touch each other. Turn your palms down, with the tips of your middle fingers still touching, and spread your elbows further to the left and right. Turn your palms up, with the tips of your middle fingers still touching. (The above movements are only a preparation for expanding the chest.)</p>
<p>At this time, clench your hands tightly and slowly pull your arms back, but when they fall to your sides, the posture is the same as at the beginning. Do not bend your wrists, turn your palms outward, and keep your forearms close to your upper arms.</p>
<p>After learning the above movements, take a deep breath, from the time your arms are in place until they return to their original position, without exhaling.</p>
<p>Exhale as much as possible each time; when inhaling next time, you can make the air sacs in your lungs expand one by one.</p>
<p>Chest Expansion: With your arms at your sides; breathe; forward; backward, forward, backward, exhale.</p>
<p>Note: Practice in class, three times is enough; practice individually, you can use your own judgment.</p>
<p>15. Shoulder Exercise</p>
<p>With your arms at your sides, as in the circle. Extend your arms forward, relaxing your muscles. Open your hands, palms down.</p>
<p>Slowly raise your hands, clench your fists tightly, and slowly pull your arms back, making your elbows reach back as far as possible (at this time, your arms gradually close together). Then slowly lower your elbows, with your forearms up, still clenched tightly, your little fingers against your ribs, without bending your wrists.</p>
