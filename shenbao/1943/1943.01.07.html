<h3>談修明政治</h3>
<p>談到修明政治，可分治本的和治標的兩方面。從政治本身去講求修明之道，就是從用人，立法和執行上去講求修明之道，道是治本。中國政治學的治本大法，只有八個字：</p>
<p>「任賢使能，賞功罰罪。」</p>
<p>陸象山先生說過，「不依規矩，不能成方圓」，立法之被重視，絕非偶然。不過，讀了中國政治史，試問中國數千年來政治黑暗腐敗的原因在那裏？這雖然是一個大問題，不是一兩句話談得盡的；可是，基本的方向却很清楚，即不在於沒有良好的立法，而在於一切良好的立法沒有切實和適當的執行，抄一句古話，就是「有治法而無治人」。中國歷史上不知有多少良好的法制，政綱之類，都斷送在「沒有善於執行」。王莽的變法，知行新法而不知用新人，結果身敗名裂，成爲千古罪人。王安石的變法，又走上了王莽失敗的老路，斷送在「任用匪人」。可惜後世士大夫不不明白這要點，集中攻擊於二王的新法，而外國史家也祇知研究二王的新法如何如何，却忽視了二王的新法是否真正實行了？是如何實行的？是由什麽人去實行的？在別國，問題多在立法上面，人民所爭的，就在有良善的立法。可是中國呢，不只要爭取良善的立法，更重要的還在爭起執行良善立法的人。若是認爲有了良善的立法，就是中國政治前途光明的證據，那是絕大的錯誤。</p>
<p>從這裏可見除了立法之外，中國政治修明之道，主要還在靠「用人與「行政」，用人需要「仟賢使能」，行政即是「執行立法」，需要「賞功罰罪」。先說「仟賢使能」，這裏要注意賢和能的分別，能者不一定賢，賢者不一定則還必須能，非賢的能者，注重在一個「使」字，而能而賢者，却必須是「任」。從這裏可以看出，主要的是重仟賢者，用現代的說法，就是要重任具有政治學識技能而具爲國家爲人民而犧牲一切的精神的份子，這種人的從政，不是爲了個人的利祿，不失爲了私人的好惡，而是爲了拯救國家民族，爲了拯救民衆，爲了實現自己的政治理想。至於「能」者，用現代的話說是具有專門學識技能的人，這種人不一定能希望其個都有革命的精神與素養，都有從政救國愛民的道德，雖一樣必須吸收，可是必須置於「賢」者之下，山「賢」者去善於使用。只有賢能份子都被吸收在政府政策的周圍，只有讓一切機會主義者不賢無能的份子被逐出政府，並且使他們失去任何憑藉相　緣的機會，才能賞功罰罪，才能充分執行良善的立法－政綱與政策。</p>
<p>再說到「行政」，主要的是賞功罰罪第一就需要「任賢使能」，次就必需貫澈「大公無私」的精神。也就是把政治本身作爲共同的目的，而不把「行政」當作達到任何個人的目的　手段。這一點在中國更爲重要。因爲中國幾乎有一千多年被處　專制封建制度之下，人人被籠罩在家族私有財產觀念之下，朝廷有以孝治天下之說，公然鼓勵營共家室之私，如儒家史有「尊其位，重其錄！以勸親親」的主張，這些獎私害公的政治毒藥，難道不正是目前有許多從政者在嘗味着嗎？在這種傳統思想之中，人人不知大公，只知營私，任使唯私，期行政賞罰亦隨之而私，賞擢無次而罰禁不行，一切法律制度只成具文，人人只知從政是達到個人目的或滿足慾望的手段，於是私親怩愛之徒，盤踞於政府要津，於是終日無事，言不及義而坐　國　以及仗勢欺凌良善，魚肉百姓的事使層出不窮。</p>
<p>有用人和行政方面，以大公無私的精神，實行「任賢使能，賞功罰罪」，是修明政治的治本辦法。不過同時還須顧到政治社會的實際環境而講究治標的辦法。無庸諱言的，中國的政府裏，除了絕少數傑出非凡的高級人才之外，有三種人物　第一種最上層是老爺，第二層是書辦之類，第三種是差役之類。這三個階層，無論在經濟地位上，在社會地位上和在精神上都有顯著的鴻溝存在。第一種是「有」的階級，無論在物質享受上，社會地位上，個人的尊嚴上，都很富有，他們除了天天對書辦和差役訓話，講道理，說主義，要他們盡忠和犧牲之外，自己便去享福了。第二種和第三種是「無」的階級，是實際的政治的工作者執行者，可是，他們在經濟上，社會上毫無地位，每天辛苦工作和受訓之後，回到家裏，對着食不飽衣不暖的妻孥父老一籌莫展。於是善良者對於政治工作是「虛應故事」，「只求無過」；而狡黠者便只有仗著政府的聲勢，營私舞弊，貪污盛行，而政治之黑暗與腐敗至不堪問聞。所以今日要談修明政治，還必須澈底撤除政府中工作人員間的藩籬，平均上下各層政工人員的生活水準，使上層人員除了演說作文交際之外都有切實的工作，使中下層人員的生活水準大大提高，從經濟地位社會地位和精神上獲得應有的安定。最後，尤爲重要的，是無論治本和治標，我們要求人民有對政治發言和參政的機會，要求輿論有振作起來的機會，只有這樣，修明政治才有保障，而也只有政治修明，中日協力和戰事上的勝利也才有保障。</p>

<h3>維里基盧基區　德蘇繼續激戰　頓河與伊爾曼湖蘇攻勢　均遭德軍擊退損失甚重</h3>
<p>柏林六日海通社電　東綫仍在激戰中、頓河方面戰況尤爲劇烈、蘇軍在東綫中部進攻、德軍頑強抵抗、蘇軍之人力與物力、均受重大之損失、蘇軍在伊爾曼湖東南六次進攻、損失尤鉅云、</p>
<p>瑞士京城六日哈瓦斯社電　據德方消息、東綫維里基盧基區、昨日繼續激戰、德軍擊毀紅軍戰車十四輛、並摧毀高加索紅軍根據地一處、德機並轟炸吉萊斯尼克區、襲擊敵方運輸部隊、泰雷克區、紅軍迭次進攻均被擊退、頓河區域、仍在激戰中、又據蘇聯方面消息、維里基盧基區戰局混沌、莫斯多克區及史達林城西南、則有激戰、柯特爾尼柯夫及庵爾斯間、正在進行會　、</p>

<h3>突尼西亞前綫德軍　衝破英美陣地兩處</h3>
<p>羅馬六日中央社電　義軍司令部五日發表戰況如次、一、西魯德戰綫、因氣候惡劣、致四日以來陸軍戰鬥均頗困難、里此亞南部沙漠地帶、反軸心軍對軸心軍前哨部隊、正加強壓迫、二、突尼西亞戰綫後、即擊退反攻敵軍、俘獲敵將校六名、士兵三百名、又德軍突襲隊突破反軸心軍陣地兩架、俘獲英兵廿八名、將校二名、將校二名、又軸心空軍於空戰時擊落敵機八架、停於地上之敵機四架亦被炸起火、三、義空軍四日夜空襲阿爾及爾港、重創該港港灣設施及軍事地帶、四、反軸心軍空軍來襲拉姆培杜　島、受害機輕、</p>
<p>維希五日哈瓦斯社電　此間軍事觀察家談稱、軸心軍在此塞大及突尼斯爾港附近所扼守之橋頭據點、殆爲北非洲戰爭中最重要最堅固之陣地、緣軸心軍佔據比塞大與突尼斯爾港後、足以完全控制「地中海之腰部」、而使英美維持地中海東西交通一項企圖、毫無希望、按英方會迭送企圖派遣商船護送隊、自直布羅陀港駛往地中海東部、但沿非洲海道前往埃及與馬爾泰島、至少須跋涉一萬四千英里、此在軸心國方面、則自突尼斯港附近之波恩角直達西西里島之馬薩拉港、僅一水之隔、且中途尚有班台勤里亞　島、雖然缺乏天然港口、要爲非常重要之據點、足爲潛水艇及空軍之根據地、最近數年來該處業　設防、並已開關飛行場數處、在突尼西亞與西西里島間之海面、係爲較遠之潛水艇及海空軍根據地所控制、西西里·特拉巴尼·巴勒摩·加泰尼亞暨奧格斯泰等地、均爲強大之空軍根據地、撒丁尼亞島南端之加格里亞利亦爲軍略要點之一、由此可知軸心軍所扼守之陣地、至爲險固、</p>
<h3>日空軍隊長談　作戰感想</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　據日軍前綫某基地來電、日空軍迭次猛炸吉大港·丁蘇基阿·雲南驛、加爾各答等地後、敵機已瀕殲減、日空軍某部隊長自去歲十二月二十五日襲擊丁蘇基阿機場以來、即參加歷次戰鬥、最近發表感想稱、駐印敵空軍之訓練教育、均尚未瑧於充分、其中尤以戰鬥機最爲顯著、彼等實際上僅受至日電教育之二分之一或三分之一程度、未曾受過當地訓練、即行參加作戰、其技術遠較我　爲劣、况空中戰鬥、機械與技術、應完全一致、始能收穫戰果、敵方對此、頗欠融合、僅賴機械優良而漠視戰鬥精神、此爲彼等最大之缺陷、我行射擊、但敵機則於遠達百米之距離即行追擊、其命中率之低、不難由此想見、迨至最近、敵機一見我戰鬥機即行逃走、又敵方最　對飛機及人員之補充、頗費苦心、似有作必死防衛之勢、至我方則仍不斷訓練戰鬥術、以期待機痛擊云、</p>

<h3>三十一年十一月澳門轉來</h3>
<p>西康微購糧食工作，康區已於十月一日開始，寗雅兩區即自十一月一日始，刻省府會同田管處發布開微命令，統限二個月徽購齊全。據說西康辦理微實工作人員，轉繳　爲新市秤，一出一入，爆發戶又增加若干。</p>

<h3>小商人訴苦</h3>
<p>南雄直稅局的故事刁難</p>
<p>我是個經營南雄菸葉的小商人，每天去南雄，却帶著我在直稅局所領得的住商銷售，預備辦菸藥之用，在南雄未設直接稅局之前，就在貨到曲江後，拿那購銷證向曲江直稅局辦理起運手續，數月來歷無阻梗，乃自九月一日南雄直稅局開辦後，對於外來辦菸葉商民，持有手續完備之購銷證者無不故意刁難，如每件能付予數十元之活動費，於章則有稍欠合者，即可准其通過，此非虛構。有關當局不妨派員前往調查，茲計因該直稅局之留難，而擱置南雄之菸葉，達四五千件之多。查該菸葉爲供摯土紙烟之原料，最近桂柳各烟廠，因感無菸葉　用而停工者已不少，其直接阻碍於商民業務之發展者，縱無關緊要；間接影響各烟廠工人之生活，豈可不一切及？爲顧惜商人以便利，茲南雄增設一直稅機關，即多增無數商民之疾苦，奈何？奈何？（鐘葆雲於柳州）</p>
<p>柳城大埔鄉酒稅的突增</p>
<p>余爲一酒商人，從事釀酒已逾數年。過去對於酒稅是商人應盡之義務。今者對於木鄉酒稅諸多問題，稅當局未能予以圓滿答覆，殊屬遺憾。</p>
<p>木鄉酒稅總額，前爲國幣一千五百餘元，從九月份起就突然增至八千五百元，增額已達五六倍。據以往增稅，實未有突增至五倍以上者。後又調查鄰鄉酒稅雖然增加，但其增加額則微，如鄰近沙埔鄉，過去稅額爲為百餘元，現增至二千元，其增加之總額未達五倍。然按兩鄉稅額之比較，本鄉與沙埔鄉之酒稅實爲四，二與一之比，另據兩鄉之酒生產量相較，則僅爲二，五與一之比。同一縣區，不同稅局，而增加之稅當局之　，則不得而知。由於酒稅之增加，稅當局反把納稅之手續減少了，在以前每逢納稅的時候，稅當局則按次給予收據，而現在稅當局無形中把　收購的手續取消了。其取消之原因，在稅局則認爲收據是不必要，而且是浪費的，這是稅局解釋廢除收據的唯一的原因。但按照過去繳納稅款之手續，稅局中需給與收據，這表示稅款是法定的，而且對這款是負責的，現在稅局把收據的手續取消了。這或許是稅局奉令增加酒稅，同時要減少填收據的職員吧！此中原因，當有令人難解之處。</p>
<p>又本鄉過去對於酒稅，是按每家酒的生產量多寡而分攤的，現在則不然了，稅局則把酒稅總額每家平均分配，由於這樣，問題就發生了，因爲在增稅的時候，有些資本較大的酒商就集合爲一家，暗中從事釀酒，而出一家酒稅，因爲其生產量多，而稅額又與生產量少的酒商一樣，其成本　低售價就便宜。因此小酒商無形中被他們打倒。</p>

<h3>東亞經濟懇談會紀實　（七）　譯自三十一年十一月下旬「同盟旬報」</h3>
<p>第二部會：金融</p>
<p>午前第二部會，推「日銀」理事荒川昌二氏爲主席。以甚於大東亞經濟建設理想之金融對策爲中心，舉行墾談。日本方面有工業昭四郎；此外，滿，蒙，華各地域代表多人。關於圈內各地域金融恊力體制之確立，各地域的貨運對策，依次發表了誠摯精采的意見。各位的發言要點如次</p>
<p>工藤昭四郎—日本</p>
<p>基於大東亞經濟建設理　的金融對策，希望大家注意下面的四點：</p>
<p>（一）東亞共榮圈通貨金融的方策，不得訴之於言動的手段，必須　日本的指揮之下，有計劃地加以執行。</p>
<p>（二）圈內單一通貨，與各地域之實狀並不適合。</p>
<p>（三）各地域通貨與日　之兌換率，必須充分參考戰前的比率。其後的變動，各地域有共通性的主要物資少價格水準，以及各地域的經濟質勞，而予以决定。</p>
<p>（四）兌换率一旦決定了下來，最好盡可能　牠固定，不再變動。</p>
<p>（五）各地的生產擴充資金，不得單靠日本供給，最好盡可能向現地調度。</p>
<p>內田常雄—滿洲</p>
<p>關於滿洲的物價問題，下列三項的解決，是非常重要的：</p>
<p>（一）產業五年計劃之遂行與物價；</p>
<p>（二）接壤圈域特殊物價現象之波及對策；</p>
<p>（三）對日重要輸出品之低物價維持。</p>
<p>重點必須放在這三點上，然後才能謀日滿一體經濟之遂行。</p>
<p>歐陽載祥—華北</p>
<p>（一）華北物價，和日滿相形之下，其所以昂騰的原因，就在法幣物價之暴落，生產力之低下，華北經濟圈之未確定，以及通貨膨脹等等。</p>
<p>（二）但是，在金融方面，金融機關管理規則業已見諸實行。因此，主要食料品以外的諸商品價格，都被壓停了下來。</p>
<p>（三）現在所　的問題，是食糧品，生活必需品等價格之騰貴問題。這是因爲上述諸物品必須仰仗國外之故。所以，現在正在急谋華北自給圈之建立。這一點倘能成功，一切問題就都解決了。</p>
<p>沈文炳—蒙疆</p>
<p>（一）蒙疆物價騰貴的原因，端在域外法幣物價之影響，蒙幣之膨脹，輸出之不振等。</p>
<p>（二）作爲上述現象的對策，現正厲行價格及收買統制，在金融方面，則厲行融資的重點主義，購買力之吸收，金融機關之統一及滙兌統制等。</p>
<p>（三）蒙疆物價，因爲輸入的關係，此他地域　高。因此，現已決定統制輸出入物資，將其價格加以調整，作爲大東亞共榮圈之一　而努力。</p>
<p>潘廷武—廣東林</p>
<p>濟川—厦門</p>
<p>（一）爲華中華南民生安定計，希望復活華僑滙款。</p>
<p>（二）物資交流之不圓滑現　，在可能範圍內，望予以疏通，並望對目下各地域極端之孤立經濟，給予綜合的特性。</p>
<h3>法租界自今年起徵收保甲附加捐捐率爲房捐額百分之十　保甲義捐自即日起停徵</h3>

<h3>公共租界經濟警察課　委五島氏兼任課長</h3>
<p>處理有關金融等問題之罪案　法租界亦將添設同樣之組織據消息靈通方面傳出、兩租界警方自去年度增強警力而獲得顯著效果後、有關當局將於今春起、作進一步之努力、以期租界內之治安、愈形堅固、茲將各情訨後、</p>
<p>最近期內計劃成立</p>
<p>據業已證實之消息　公共租界上部局警務處於最近期內、將計劃成立經濟警察課、課長由副警務處長五島兼任、一俟成立後、各有關經濟金融等問題之罪案、均將出該課處理、如去歲下半年所　動金市之投機商人被捕事件等、嗣後即當由该課直接處置、至於各商店之超越限價、與不法商人之囤積貨物、以及其他明知足以擾亂平民生計而仍圖謀其一己之暴利者、聞嗣後或亦將由該新設之經濟警察課加以偵查而予以逮捕及處罰、</p>
<p>職員人選聘自日本</p>
<p>因經濟警察課之設立、實足以壓低物價而維持一般民衆之正常生活、是以本埠居民、咸望　種計劃、能早日實現、又聞公共租界警務處、對於經濟警察課職員之人選、除一部分聘自日本外、另一部份則係由本埠實施訓練、至法租界方面、聞亦步趨公共租界後塵、於公共租界成立經濟警察課後、法警務處亦　添設同樣之組織、</p>

<h3>關於冬賑的時間性</h3>
<p>— 唐雄風</p>
<p>無能爲自己解決衣食住的流浪羣，每逢到了冬天，例有公私善團和作人善士，爲他們舉辦冬賑，救濟他們渡過「飢寒交迫」的雞關。去年如此，今年也如此，卽便在事變以還，也從未中輟過，尤其在社會生活離亂動盪的年頭，更値得歌頌，爲流浪難胞慶幸。但是，今年的冬賑工作，似乎不是冷落而有些遲緩，甚至有「臨渴掘井」之憾！例如本市三十一年度冬賑籌慕委員會，無疑爲今冬「冬賑」一支主力，但目前委員人選甫定，尚待成立。又滬西貧民救濟會設立的臨時寒庇所，目前才落成一所，尚有計定中的二三兩所，猶在籌覔空地。可是論季候，距離「立春」僅一月，目前的氣溫紀錄，已曾好幾次降至華氏五十度以下，馬路上結過冰，應是進入了「隆冬」階段。而衣不蔽體挨餓　宿之羣，遠在人們卸換下「秋裝大衣」的當兒，也是第一次寒浪襲激下，開始「飢寒交迫」了，開始抵不住飢寒而倒斃了！</p>
<p>這個事實在普善山莊的收殮報告中可以見得；在每冬轉寒的第一「冷汎」，路屍的數字驟然激增！因此事實告訴我們，一般人的感到冷，尤其是仁人善士，將與苦難流浪羣的知覺，有着「時間」上的迥異，在彼此不同的環境遭遇中，歷年的「冬賑」，便往往造成「遲到早退」似的紀錄！</p>
<p>在三十一年度冬賑工作方在開始的現在，我們希望迅速地進行，不致過於延誤了，「冬」的時間性，同時，我們更希望在三十二年度能予以提早，以獲「及時」「及事」的美滿效果。各界善士，能於「已凉大氣未寒時」的秋冬之交，予苦難者羣以同情，儘光慨解仁囊。</p>

<h3>重於泰山的「死」</h3>
<p>— 蓬六</p>
<p>造化者似乎帶着嬉弄的態度，替一切生物安排了一定的生命過程：生·老病·死，凡是生物都不能逃去這過程，就是萬物之靈的人類，亦誰都不免一死，於是「死」便成了全人類乃至全生物界唯一的最後歸宿，唯其如此，「死」是人生中最平凡却又最神秘的一件事。</p>
<p>我們都知道死亡大都是爲了疾病，此外我們有時可以聽到人家說某翁無疾而終：所以一般地說，死的原因不外兩種，生病而死的是病死，年老無疾而終的不妨叫它做老死。</p>
<p>再說到這兩種死亡在生理機構中的變化，我們先得探討些生理的情形。身體的死亡，最先是因了體內某一重要器官單獨先死而致：體內器官很多，其中最爲重要而居於主宰地位的，是心臟和神經；體內一切器官都靠心臟輸送養料除去廢物，亦都受神經管理而起各種生理作用。當心臟死亡而停止工作後，體內血液循環亦隨之停頓，於是全身各部的細胞都因沒有養料而逐漸死亡，各器官亦因之而死。當神經死亡後，心臟以及其他各器官都因失去宰制而次第死亡。再說心臟和神經本身的死亡：心臟瀕死時其下半部先减緩動作，上半部仍正常，繼則下半部完全靜止而上半部動作漸次减退，再則上半部之左半漸趨停頓而右半仍能跳動，最後則右半亦呈停頓而整個心臟陷於靜止。神經死亡前，其機能必較平常更增高（俗語所謂死前的『廻光返照』亦即爲此），但片刻後又迅速减退終至完全消失；在全部神經系中，腦子首先最速死亡，其機能消失於俄頃，其次爲脊髓，最後爲末梢神經，且距腦子愈遠其機能消失愈緩。</p>
<p>回到上述的兩種死因來說，病死者大都是先有心死再引起其他器官的死，而老死則大都先有腦死。病死時的心死，或由於外來的損害作用（例如傳染病時的細菌毒素），或由於體內因病變而產生的毒物，使心臟中毒而死。至於老死則因腦子是最易衰老的組織，經一生勞瘁後終至死亡。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可知我們人人都可因病而死，苟能常保不病，最後亦必老死，遲早終是一死。進一步來說，爲自身着想，我們該保待健康不病，寗願讓身體自生自滅地老死，却不願被「毒素」侵入心中而「心死」，更進一步來說，生生死死千古一理；若要生，必須預備着死，而且不願爲輕於鴻毛必須爲重於泰山的死；這才是人類優於其他生物的「死」，這才是不平凡而又不神秘的死」。</p>
<h3>赫胥黎論人類不死問題　—世界著名科學家的書翰之一</h3>
<p>— Lincoln　Schuster譯　古心著</p>
<p>人生對於環繞的宇宙沒有某種符合，就不會存在—那種符合包括着幸福超過痛苦的某種定量。簡單地說，我們活，我們是得着活的代價的。</p>
<p>看不到人類活動和他們的獎賞之間，有着顯然的不符時，我們就必須記得，大自然比了我們更加公平。她記下一個人所帶給世世的東西，這是人類的公平所辦不到的。如果我生來便是一個兇殘的暴徒，從別人因襲到種種惡質，殺了你，我的同胞的人類當然就會很公平的縊死我，但是我就免於那種可怕的悔恨了，假使我的天性要高等些，我做了那同樣的事，悔恨當然就是我的眞正懲罰了。</p>
<p>事物系統的絕對公平，在我看起來正和任何科學事實一樣的淸楚。罪惡對於悲愁的吸引力，正和地球對於太陽的吸引力一樣的確定，並且更加確定，因爲事實上的證騐是我們大家所能接觸得的，—不，只要我們有眼睛去看，在我們的眼前是放得明明白白的。</p>
<p>因此，我不但相信果報的行爲，我更相信尋求死後的獎懲會叫人完全忽視了這樣的事實：他們不可免的獎懲就在現世。</p>
<p>如果料想到來世的地獄就會使我有做壞事，那末，當然，現世地獄的確實性，就格外會使我不做壞事了。如果一個人能够確實有一種印象，相信作了賊會使自己受害，正與呑吃砒霜相仿。（事實上的確如此），那末這種信仰的諫阻作惡力，不是比了以來世報益爲根據的力更大？</p>
<p>對於第一個敎學，我不是樂觀主義者，但是我有最堅實的信仰，以爲神聖的政府（假定我們關以因這樣一個名稱，來表示『物體慣習』的總數）是完全公平的。我愈知道別人的生活（不必說我自己的生活），我就愈明白惡人不會發達而善人不會受罰。不過爲了淸楚起見，我們必須在心裏記得，那些差不多已經完全忘記的事情，那就是說，人生的獎賞，只要順從全部的定律—身體的以及道德的—就會不時獲得，而道德的順從却不能救贖身體的罪過，反過來也是一樣。</p>
<p>大神的總賬簿是嚴格地登記着的，每一個人的所作所爲，在他存在的每一分鐘末了都結算得淸淸楚楚。</p>
<p>這話却使我想起了另外一點。</p>
<p>那一天，我立在我小兒子棺材的後面，我的心裏一些也沒有什麽不安，牧師按着他的職務，讀了這樣的話：『如果死人不會復活，我們就吃喝吧，因爲明天我們就要死的。』這些話怎樣難以形容的震動我，我不能告訴你。保羅（Paul）既没有妻子，也没有兒女，否則他必定會知道，他的話簡直褻凟了人類天性中一切最佳的和最高貴的東西。我能夠輕蔑地恥笑着。什麼！因為我親自遇到不能補償的損失，因為我已將極大幸福的主因還給牠所從以出來的根源，在我的一生中，仍舊保持着從那個主因所躍出來的或者將要　出來的種種福氣，而我却要看輕我的人性，咆哮着，墮落到獸性上去麼？呀，就是猿猴也格外知道得多些，如果你射死了牠們的幼小者，牠們也會哀號痛哭，不會立刻躲到峽谷中去。</p>

<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>一個偉大的笑話，傳得很久的笑話—但是多少也是一個悲哀的笑話。吉普斯坐在火爐旁，秋天的暴風震撼着窗戶，這時，諧笑與悲哀的波浪不時掃過他，直等到他的眼淚落了下來。因此，當威葛特夫人送茶進來時，簡直不知道他究竟已經在那裏笑過還是哭過。恐怕吉普斯自己也弄不明白吧。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>勃洛克菲爾德是在路的對面，一排老楡樹的後面，各處罩滿了藤蔓之類，在秋光裏作着微紅的顏色。一羣十九世紀的房子，圍了一個方方的庭院集中着，此外便是許多畝的運動塲；再過去便是倚此成立的小村莊，和空曠的沼澤鄉野。誠如威澤培所說，勃洛克菲爾德是一個老基礎，牠是在伊利沙伯（Elizabeth）時代設立的一個小學校，如果運氣好些，也許已經和哈羅（Harron）一樣著名了。然而牠的運氣並沒有這樣好；牠經過了波折，有一時差不多就此消滅有一時則差不多光芒萬丈可以與別的學校爭勝。就在這些後來起伏不停的時期裏，有一時期，正在第一個喬治（Geotge）王在位的時候，主要的建築得到了改造，另外也有了大量的增加。再後些，在拿破崙的戰爭之後，直到維多利亞（Victoria）時代的中期，牠又在人數和名譽上衰落了下去。一八四〇年威澤培來了，他到底恢復了牠的一些幸運；不過此後牠總沒有被提高到一等的地位。但是牠究竟還不失為第二等的良好學校。若干名門世家支持着牠；牠造就了當代造成歷史的大人物—法官，國會議員，殖民地行政官，以及少數的貴族和主教。然而牠造就得最多的，却是商人，製造家，和職業界的人才，而鄉紳和敎區長也不算少。有些學校，人們一提起牠的名字，一般誇誕的人就會說，他們好像曾聽見過這個學校的，以自鳴其見聞的廣博，勃洛克菲爾　就有些像這樣的一個學校。</p>
<p>不過假使牠不是這樣的一個學校，牠也許就不會聘請吉普斯來了。因爲吉普斯，在任何社會的或學院的意味來說，却正和勃洛克菲爾德一樣，薄有微名而不見得怎樣大有盛譽（四）</p>

<h3>On Discussing and Clarifying Politics</h3>
<p>Speaking of discussing and clarifying politics, it can be divided into two aspects: addressing the root cause and addressing the symptoms. To seek the way to clarification from politics itself is to seek the way to clarification from the aspects of personnel selection, legislation, and execution, which is addressing the root cause. The fundamental principles of Chinese political science for addressing the root cause are only eight characters:</p>
<p>"Appoint the virtuous and employ the capable, reward merit and punish wrongdoing."</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xiangshan once said, "Without rules, there can be no circles or squares." The importance of legislation is by no means accidental. However, after reading Chinese political history, one may ask, what is the reason for the darkness and corruption of Chinese politics for thousands of years? Although this is a big question that cannot be fully discussed in a few words, the basic direction is very clear, which lies not in the lack of good legislation, but in the fact that all good legislation is not effectively and appropriately implemented. To quote an ancient saying, it is "having laws but lacking those who can govern." In Chinese history, there were countless good laws and political programs, but they were all ruined by "the lack of those skilled in execution." Wang Mang's reform knew how to implement new laws but did not know how to use new people, resulting in his disgrace and becoming a sinner for thousands of years. Wang Anshi's reform followed the old path of Wang Mang's failure and was ruined by "appointing treacherous people." Unfortunately, later scholar-officials did not understand this key point and focused their attacks on the new laws of the two Wangs, while foreign historians only studied how the new laws of the two Wangs were, but neglected whether the new laws of the two Wangs were truly implemented, how they were implemented, and by whom they were implemented. In other countries, the problem lies mostly in legislation, and what the people strive for is good legislation. But what about China? It is not only necessary to strive for good legislation, but more importantly, to strive for people who can implement good legislation. If one believes that having good legislation is evidence of a bright future for Chinese politics, that is a huge mistake.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that in addition to legislation, the way to clarify Chinese politics mainly relies on "personnel selection" and "administration." Personnel selection requires "appointing the virtuous and employing the capable," and administration is "executing legislation," which requires "rewarding merit and punishing wrongdoing." First, let's talk about "appointing the virtuous and employing the capable." Here, we must pay attention to the distinction between virtue and ability. A capable person is not necessarily virtuous, and a virtuous person must also be capable. Non-virtuous capable people should be focused on the word "employ," while virtuous and capable people must be "appointed." From this, it can be seen that the main thing is to value and appoint the virtuous. In modern terms, it means to appoint those who have political knowledge and skills and have the spirit of sacrificing everything for the country and the people. Such people's involvement in politics is not for personal gain or loss, not for personal likes and dislikes, but for saving the country and the nation, for saving the people, and for realizing their political ideals. As for the "capable" people, in modern terms, they are people with specialized knowledge and skills. It is not necessarily expected that all of these people have a revolutionary spirit and qualities, or have the morality of engaging in politics to save the country and love the people. Although they must also be absorbed, they must be placed under the "virtuous" and be skillfully used by the "virtuous." Only when virtuous and capable individuals are absorbed into the periphery of government policies, only when all opportunists who are neither virtuous nor capable are expelled from the government, and only when they are deprived of any opportunities for reliance and association can merit be rewarded and wrongdoing be punished, and only then can good legislation - political programs and policies - be fully implemented.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about "administration." The main thing is to reward merit and punish wrongdoing. First, it is necessary to "appoint the virtuous and employ the capable," and second, it is necessary to implement the spirit of "impartiality and selflessness." That is, to regard politics itself as a common goal, and not to regard "administration" as a means to achieve any personal goals. This point is even more important in China, because China has been under autocratic feudalism for almost a thousand years, and everyone is shrouded in the concept of family private property. The imperial court has the saying of "governing the world with filial piety," openly encouraging the pursuit of family interests. For example, Confucian scholars have the proposition of "respecting their position and valuing their emolument to encourage affection for relatives." Aren't these political poisons that reward selfishness and harm the public being tasted by many politicians today? In this kind of traditional thinking, everyone only knows how to pursue personal gain and only knows how to employ people based on personal relationships, so administrative rewards and punishments also become private. Rewards and promotions are disorderly, and punishments and prohibitions are not implemented. All laws and systems become mere formalities. Everyone only knows that engaging in politics is a means to achieve personal goals or satisfy desires. Therefore, those who are close and affectionate occupy important positions in the government. As a result, they do nothing all day long, their words are not righteous, and they sit idle and harm the country. In addition, acts of relying on power to bully the good and oppress the people emerge endlessly.</p>
<p>Using impartial and selfless spirit in personnel selection and administration, and implementing "appointing the virtuous and employing the capable, rewarding merit and punishing wrongdoing," is the fundamental solution to clarifying politics. However, at the same time, we must also consider the actual environment of the political society and pay attention to symptomatic solutions. It is undeniable that, in the Chinese government, in addition to a very small number of outstanding and extraordinary senior talents, there are three types of people: the first and highest level are the "masters," the second level are the "clerks," and the third level are the "runners." There are significant gaps in economic status, social status, and spirit among these three levels. The first type is the "haves," who are very wealthy in terms of material enjoyment, social status, and personal dignity. Apart from lecturing to the clerks and runners every day, telling them about principles and doctrines, and asking them to be loyal and make sacrifices, they themselves go to enjoy life. The second and third types are the "have-nots," who are the actual political workers and implementers. However, they have no status in terms of economy or society. After working hard and being trained every day, they return home and are at a loss when facing their wives, children, parents, and elders who are not well-fed or warmly clothed. Therefore, the good people "perfunctorily perform their duties" and "only seek to avoid mistakes" in their political work; while the cunning ones only rely on the government's reputation to engage in corruption and bribery, and the darkness and corruption of politics are unbearable to hear. Therefore, if we want to discuss clarifying politics today, we must also thoroughly remove the barriers between government staff members, equalize the living standards of political workers at all levels, make upper-level personnel have real work besides giving speeches, writing articles, and socializing, and greatly improve the living standards of middle and lower-level personnel, so that they can obtain due stability in terms of economic status, social status, and spirit. Finally, what is even more important is that, whether addressing the root cause or the symptoms, we require the people to have the opportunity to speak out and participate in politics, and we require public opinion to have the opportunity to rise up. Only in this way can the clarification of politics be guaranteed, and only when politics is clarified can cooperation between China and Japan and victory in war be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>The Zhejiang Authorities Train Surrendered Chongqing Troops</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The area bordering Fuyang, Xiaoshan, and Shaoxing in eastern Zhejiang has always been a place where Chongqing stragglers roam. Furthermore, the troops are mixed, and there are often internecine battles.

<h3>Fierce Battles Continue Between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Velikiye Luki Area; Soviet Offensives on the Don River and Lake Ilmen Are Repelled by German Forces with Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Fierce fighting continues on the Eastern Front, with particularly intense fighting on the Don River front. Soviet forces launched an offensive in the central part of the Eastern Front, but were met with fierce resistance from German forces. The Soviet forces suffered heavy losses in both manpower and materials. Soviet forces launched six offensives southeast of Lake Ilmen, suffering particularly heavy losses.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 6th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to German sources, fierce fighting continued yesterday in the Velikiye Luki area on the Eastern Front. German forces destroyed 14 Red Army tanks and destroyed a Red Army base in the Caucasus. German aircraft also bombed the Kirieshi area and attacked enemy transport units. In the Terek area, repeated Soviet offensives were repelled. Fighting continues in the Don River area. According to Soviet sources, the situation in the Velikiye Luki area is chaotic, and there is fierce fighting in the Mozdok area and southwest of Stalingrad. Encirclements are taking place between Kotelnikovo and Elista.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German military authorities issued a statement at noon on the 5th regarding the situation on the Eastern Front, stating that although Soviet forces have recently launched constant counter-offensives in various places, the overall situation of the war has hardly changed. The Soviet Union's claim that it has recovered Velikiye Luki is merely an exaggerated and false propaganda. The German positions in the area remain as solid as ever. The Soviet counter-offensive launched in the Terek area was defeated after losing a large number of tanks. The enemy has also been repelled in the Don River area after fierce fighting. The German military authorities are still keeping silent about the detailed situation in various places. Based on past experience, it can be seen that this treasure has a profound meaning. Although the Soviet Union has repeatedly published special war results, it is difficult to determine the true situation in the vast combat area and severe winter climate. The Soviet Union has repeatedly attempted to stimulate the German side by publishing information, so the German side has had to issue explanations in order to clarify the current state of the war.</p>
<h3>Axis Submarines Go to the Atlantic to Prepare to Attack British Convoys</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to sources in Berlin, the Axis countries have dispatched several submarines to the Atlantic in order to attack convoys transporting troops and military aircraft to the British military headquarters in North Africa. The Allies are attempting to use the protection of the African coast and shorten the sea route from Brazil to near Cape Verde in Africa, so most of the Axis submarines are long-range submarines and are fully equipped to cope with this difficult task. Some of them even have special equipment to carry out repairs on the high seas.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Soar Over Tokyo to Celebrate Unprecedented Victory</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A large formation of approximately 500 Japanese army air force aircraft, consisting of heavy and light bombers and various types of fighter and reconnaissance aircraft, visited Nanjing at 11:00 a.m. on the 6th. The roaring of engines and the glittering of silver wings filled the air as they unfolded a grand aerial review to celebrate the Japanese army's unprecedented victory. Seven million citizens of Tokyo looked up at the majestic appearance of the aircraft and were all extremely excited.</p>
<h3>German Forces on the Tunisian Front Break Through British and American Positions in Two Places</h3>
<p>Rome, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Italian military headquarters announced the battle situation on the 5th as follows: 1. On the Sirte front, the land battle has been difficult since the 4th due to adverse weather conditions. In the southern desert area of ​​Libya, the anti-Axis forces are strengthening their pressure on the Axis forward outposts. 2. On the Tunisian front, the Axis forces repelled the counter-attacking enemy forces, capturing six enemy generals and 300 soldiers. In addition, a German assault team broke through two anti-Axis positions, capturing 28 British soldiers and two generals. 3. The Axis air force bombed the port of Algiers on the night of the 4th, heavily damaging the port facilities and military areas. 4. The anti-Axis air force attacked the island of Lampedusa, causing minor damage.</p>
<p>Vichy, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Military observers here said that the bridgeheads held by the Axis forces near Bizerte and Tunis are the most important and solid positions in the North African war. The Axis forces' occupation of Bizerte and Tunis is sufficient to completely control the "waist of the Mediterranean" and render the Anglo-American attempt to maintain east-west traffic in the Mediterranean hopeless. The British have repeatedly attempted to send merchant ship convoys from the port of Gibraltar to the eastern Mediterranean, but the voyage along the African sea route to Egypt and Malta requires at least 14,000 miles. On the Axis side, the distance from Cape Bon near Tunis to Marsala in Sicily is only a narrow strip of water, and there is also the island of Pantelleria in the middle, which, although lacking natural ports, is a very important base that can serve as a base for submarines and air forces. It has been fortified in recent years and several airfields have been built. The waters between Tunisia and Sicily are controlled by more distant submarine and naval air bases. Sicily, Trapani, Palermo, Catania, and Augusta are all strong air bases. Cagliari at the southern tip of Sardinia is also an important military point. It can be seen from this that the positions held by the Axis forces are extremely dangerous and solid.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Captain Talks About His Impressions of Combat</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army front-line base, after the Japanese air force repeatedly bombed Chittagong, Tinsukia, Yunnan-Yi, Calcutta, and other places, the enemy aircraft have been on the verge of annihilation. The commander of a certain unit of the Japanese air force, who has participated in numerous battles since attacking the Tinsukia airport on December 25 last year, recently expressed his impressions, saying that the training and education of the enemy air force stationed in India have not yet been fully developed, especially the fighter aircraft. They have actually only received two-fifths or one-third of the Japanese education and have not received local training before participating in combat. Their technology is far inferior to ours. Moreover, in aerial combat, the machines and technology must be completely consistent in order to achieve results. The enemy lacks this integration, relying only on superior machines and neglecting fighting spirit. This is their biggest defect. We shoot accurately, but enemy aircraft pursue from a distance of 100 meters, so the low hit rate can be imagined. Until recently, enemy aircraft would flee as soon as they saw our fighters. Furthermore, the enemy has been making great efforts to replenish aircraft and personnel, seeming to be making a desperate defense. As for our side, we are constantly training in combat tactics, hoping to give the enemy a painful blow.</p>
<h3>Thailand Announces This Year's Budget</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Thailand's budget for this year, which was passed by parliament in November of last year, was officially announced in a special government gazette on the 5th.

The main items include national defense expenditures of 40,377,125 baht and internal affairs expenditures of 27,195,918 baht. All expenditures are reduced compared to last year. In addition, the various capitals of the newly established Thailand Rubber Company, state-owned companies, and the Central Bank are all drawn from the country's public bonds, the Ministry of Finance's reserves, and other revenues.</p>
<p>Brief News from Kangding</p>
<h3>Transferred from Macau in November of the 31st Year</h3>
<p>The work of purchasing food grains in Western Sichuan, Kang District, began on October 1st. The Ningya districts began on November 1st. Currently, the Provincial Government, together with the Field Management Office, has issued an order to start the requisition, with a uniform limit of two months to complete the purchase. It is said that the staff handling the requisition work in Western Sichuan have changed the scales to the new city scale. With one entry and one exit, the nouveaux riches have increased again.</p>
<p>Now is the time when the weather is clear and crisp outside the pass in autumn, the so-called "July, August, September is the best time to travel." In general, Kang Tibetan lama temples and merchants from the caravan continue to arrive in Ya, exchanging cloth for tea, so the business of the various "guo chun" (tea shops) has suddenly become active.</p>
<p>The Dengke ferry crossing on the Jinsha River, which must be passed when traveling from northern Kang to Tibet, originally had two leather boats for ferrying. Recently, due to the frequent visits of Han and Tibetan officials and merchants, the original leather boats are not sufficient for use. The Provincial Government has ordered the Transportation Bureau to improve wooden boats and to repair the old roads of Yajiang, Tianquan, Baoxing, and Maoxian counties to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Team Leader Du of the surveying team from Dege to Yushu: The team's work is progressing smoothly, and it can be completed by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Due to poor food, the health of teachers and students at the Western Sichuan Normal School has been greatly affected. The faculty and staff of the school have jointly telegraphed the "Ministry of Education" to negotiate.</p>

<h3>Small Businessmen's Complaints</h3>
<p>The Troublesome Story of the Nanxiong Direct Tax Bureau</p>
<p>I am a small businessman dealing in Nanxiong tobacco leaves. Each day I go to Nanxiong, carrying the residential and commercial sales permit I obtained from the Direct Tax Bureau, intending to use it for the purchase of tobacco. Before the establishment of the Nanxiong Direct Tax Bureau, I would take the purchase and sales permit to the Qujiang Direct Tax Bureau after the goods arrived in Qujiang to complete the shipping手续, which had been smooth for months. However, since the Nanxiong Direct Tax Bureau opened on September 1st, it has deliberately created difficulties for outside tobacco merchants who hold complete purchase and sales permits. For example, if one could pay tens of dollars in "activity fees," even if the regulations were slightly non-compliant, they would be allowed to pass. This is not a fabrication. Relevant authorities may wish to send personnel to investigate. It is estimated that because of the Nanxiong Direct Tax Bureau's obstruction, as many as four to five thousand pieces of Nanxiong tobacco leaves have been held up. It is known that these tobacco leaves are used as raw materials for local handmade paper cigarettes. Recently, many cigarette factories in Guilin and Liuzhou have suspended operations because they lack tobacco leaves, which directly hinders the development of commercial businesses. Even if that is not important, how can we not be concerned about the indirect impact on the livelihoods of workers in various cigarette factories? To care for merchants and facilitate business, the establishment of a direct tax agency in Nanxiong has only increased the suffering of countless merchants. What to do? What to do?

<p>Sudden Increase in Wine Tax in Dabu Township, Liucheng</p>
<p>I am a wine merchant who has been engaged in winemaking for several years. In the past, wine tax was an obligation that merchants should fulfill. Now, there are many problems with the wine tax in Muxiang Township, and the tax authorities have failed to provide a satisfactory answer, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>The total amount of wine tax in Muxiang Township used to be more than 1,500 yuan in national currency. Starting in September, it suddenly increased to 8,500 yuan, an increase of five or six times. According to past tax increases, there has never been a sudden increase of more than five times. Later, it was investigated that although the wine tax in neighboring townships had increased, the amount of the increase was small. For example, in nearby Shapu Township, the tax amount used to be more than one hundred yuan, and now it has increased to 2,000 yuan, and the total increase is less than five times. However, according to a comparison of the tax amounts in the two townships, the wine tax in this township is four, two, and one times that of Shapu Township. In addition, according to a comparison of the wine production in the two townships, it is only two, five, and one times. The county is the same district, but the tax bureaus are different, and the intentions of the tax authorities regarding the increase are not known. Due to the increase in wine tax, the tax authorities have instead reduced the tax payment procedures. In the past, every time taxes were paid, the tax authorities would issue receipts. Now, the tax authorities have tacitly canceled the purchase procedure. The reason for the cancellation, according to the tax bureau, is that receipts are unnecessary and wasteful. This is the only reason the tax bureau has given for abolishing receipts. However, according to the past procedures for paying taxes, the tax bureau needed to issue receipts, which indicated that the tax was statutory and that the tax bureau was responsible for the funds. Now the tax bureau has canceled the receipt procedure. Perhaps the tax bureau was ordered to increase wine tax and also to reduce the number of staff filling out receipts! The reason for this must have something that is difficult to understand.</p>
<p>In the past, the wine tax in this township was apportioned according to the amount of wine produced by each household. Now it is different. The tax bureau evenly distributes the total amount of wine tax to each household. Because of this, problems have arisen. Because during the tax increase, some winemakers with larger capital gathered together into one household and secretly engaged in winemaking, paying the wine tax for only one household. Because their production volume is high, and the tax amount is the same as winemakers with small production volumes, their costs are low and their selling prices are cheap. Therefore, small winemakers are being defeated by them invisibly.</p>

<h3>On the Eve of the Opening of the U.S. Congress, Both Parties Prepare Strategies, Next Year's Budget Reaches Tens of Millions of Yuan, Optimism Difficult for the President's Control of Congress</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Haitong News Agency) A Washington dispatch states that the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States are making final efforts to prepare for the opening of Congress. The Democratic Party still nominates Rayburn as Speaker of the House of Representatives, while the Republican Party focuses on Marley. In the meeting to decide its policy, the Republican Party decided on all government proposals. At the same time, the Democratic Party also disagrees with the "American Piverlayqi Plan." Political observers in the U.S. capital believe, based on the current situation, that it is difficult for President Roosevelt to control the current Congress. When drafting the message to Congress, President Roosevelt invited Hopkins, Rosenman, and the famous writer Sherwood as his advisors.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Haitong News Agency) According to White House Secretary O'Leary yesterday, the U.S. next year's budget, which was originally scheduled to be submitted to Congress this Friday, will be submitted to Congress for approval next Monday. It was previously known that the U.S. war expenditure budget for one year from July 1st is 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Haitong News Agency) According to Washington news, President Roosevelt has issued an order stipulating that the wartime transportation bureau controls the country's buses, streetcars, and ferries. At the same time, it was announced that the Ministry of Justice has stopped investigating railroad companies and automobile companies that were accused of violating antitrust laws, but the reasons were not disclosed.</p>
<h3>United Nations Issues Joint Statement</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) Although there have been frequent reports of the anti-Axis countries launching a counterattack in 1943, in reality, the situation of the war is already irreversible. Moreover, because the war has become protracted, disagreements have been exposed at any time. According to a Washington dispatch, the so-called seventeen United Nations and the French National Committee issued a statement on the 5th stating that all property in occupied countries will be returned to its rightful owners after the Axis powers are driven out of those countries. Merchants in neutral countries believe that the purpose of this statement is to prevent divisions and disputes caused by disagreements among the anti-Axis countries.</p>
<h3>Girod Arrives in Dakar Suddenly</h3>
<p>Tangier, 6th (Haitong News Agency) Girod arrived in Dakar today to inspect various parts of French West Africa. His plane was escorted by twenty-five planes. After Girod arrived in Dakar, he immediately held talks with the Governor-General of French West Africa, Boyason. London expressed considerable surprise at Girod's sudden arrival in Dakar.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Haitong News Agency) According to Algiers Radio, the new British Resident Minister in North Africa, Malcolm MacDonald, visited Girod, Chairman of the North African French political power, on the 5th to hold talks. In addition, Girod is also scheduled to go to Dakar to meet with U.S. military representatives within a few days.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Haitong News Agency) The headquarters of the anti-Axis forces in French North Africa previously arrested twelve senior French officials who were planning to assassinate Girod, Chairman of the North African French political power. According to a telegram from Algiers, the U.S. authorities are still continuing to conduct fierce investigations throughout Algiers and have arrested many people. It is reported that among these arrested persons, there are also people close to Girod. Their names have not yet been determined. It is learned that a senior French general is also among those arrested. Girod is also quite dissatisfied with the U.S.'s suspicious actions and is reported to have raised objections to Murphy, the U.S. Chief Administrator of North Africa.</p>
<h3>British Military and Political Leaders Go to Gibraltar to Hold Important Meetings, It Is Reported That British Commander in North Africa, Eisenhower, and Ambassador to Spain, Hall, Both Participated</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Haitong News Agency) It is widely rumored here that the British fleet is currently gathering at the Gibraltar naval port. According to a telegram from Madrid, it is reported that Eisenhower, commander of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa, went to the port a day ago to meet with the Governor of Gibraltar and the Governor of Malta, Gort, and others to hold important discussions. In addition, the British Ambassador to Spain, Hall, also participated in the talks. After the meeting ended, Gort left for London to report on the political situation to his country. At the same time, Eisenhower also returned to Algiers.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Advocate Opening a Second Battlefield</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Haitong News Agency) According to a report from the Stockholm newspaper's correspondent in London, British newspapers are now issuing urgent calls, demanding the speedy establishment of a second battlefield. According to the News Chronicle, a newspaper belonging to the British Labour Party, whether viewed politically or militarily, the establishment of a second battlefield is an urgent task. Before the Soviet Union launches an offensive, we must obtain a base on the European continent. If we look at Germany in 1918 and today, we know that today's German army has obtained greater resources. Therefore, we must quickly build a second front to disperse Germany's fifty divisions in the Soviet territory, lest Germany launch a spring offensive again this year.</p>
<h3>South Africa Conscripts Women into the Army</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Haitong News Agency) A Johannesburg dispatch states that the African army will double the use of female soldiers.

<h3>Authorities Plan to Consult and Purchase Rice from Various Regions, Rationing of Food Products Will Gradually Increase, A Large Amount of Sugar Has Arrived in Shanghai and Entered Warehouses</h3>
<p>The rise in rice prices not only affects public security and the people's livelihood, but also stimulates the prices of all goods, which is not a small matter. The authorities are continuing to take necessary measures to ensure that the amount of supply is sufficient for the residents of all circles to cook with the household rice flour purchased on schedule. Currently, the rice prices in the nearby areas and Shanghai are vastly different. We are studying with relevant parties to find ways to transport it to Shanghai for the market. In the near future, we may jointly purchase a large amount of rice from rice-producing areas in cooperation with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Household Rice Price</p>
<p>The contracting rice shops handling the sale of household rice have received the twenty-third batch of purchase orders and started paying the money to pick up the goods from the designated warehouses yesterday. The upper [illegible] reporter learned from the rice industry that the next batch of household grain will be given half a liter of white rice, one liter of brown rice, and half of magazine rice, which is half a liter more than the previous batch. Flour will be one and a half catties, which is four taels less than the previous batch. The price of rice for each rice shop is 304 yuan and 4 jiao, and the price of each bag of flour is 92 yuan. As for the quantity and price sold by each rice shop, it must wait for the official announcement by the authorities.</p>
<p>Control Office Plan</p>
<p>Since the Public Works Bureau's Material Control Office separated from the General Office this year and became an independent agency, it is now expanding its scope of work and cooperating with relevant authorities to implement new price management countermeasures. The most important step at present is to adjust the supply and demand of materials within the concession. It is said that the decision has been made to increase the items of material rationing in the shortest possible time. The principle is that the rationing items are not limited to the existing white rice, flour, and bread, and will be extended to all food products. Once all food products are rationed, they will be extended to the clothing department. Consumer associations and purchasing associations will be used as rationing agencies. The organization of these agencies will make full use of the Baojia system.</p>
<p>Oil on Sale Starting Today</p>
<p>After the retail oil shops in the two concessions and the urban area were divided into two groups, A and B, to sell edible oil, Group A had already sold out on January 3. From the 4th, both groups A and B did not sell. Starting today (the 7th), Group B oil shops will continue to sell for four days. The total amount of more than 4,000 dan that had been paid for on the 5th and received on the 6th has been completely picked up last night and can be sold in full starting at 9:00 AM today. The oil will still be purchased by each person by queuing up according to the number, and each person can buy one catty of oil for 7 yuan and 1 jiao in storage notes, including donation. The sales period is scheduled for four days, until the 10th when it will be sold out. Whether it will be distributed by head or by household after the 10th is still being planned in detail.</p>
<p>This Month's Sugar</p>
<p>The Sugar Cooperative Business Office has been approved by the authorities, and the total monthly ration will increase to 40,000 bags starting in January. According to a Great Eastern News Agency reporter, December's sugar is still being retailed, and the rationing [illegible] for January has been issued, with a deadline for receiving the certificate before the 8th.</p>
<p>The actual amount of sugar stored in this city is gradually decreasing. It is learned that a large amount of sugar has been shipped by friendly countries and is being stored in warehouses. Therefore, the sugar supply in this city will not be interrupted and will continue.</p>

<h3>Record of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference (7), Translated from the "Domei Xunbao" in Late November 1942</h3>
<p>Second Section: Finance</p>
<p>In the morning, the second section elected Mr. Masaji Arakawa, Director of the "Bank of Japan," as chairman. The discussions were centered on financial countermeasures that are more ideal for the economic construction of Greater East Asia. On the Japanese side was Shojiro Kudo; in addition, there were many representatives from Manchuria, Mongolia, and various regions of China. Regarding the establishment of a financial cooperation system within the circle, and the cargo transportation countermeasures in various regions, sincere and brilliant opinions were successively expressed. The main points of everyone's speeches are as follows:</p>
<p>Shojiro Kudo—Japan</p>
<p>Based on the financial countermeasures that are ideal for the economic construction of Greater East Asia, I hope everyone will pay attention to the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) The currency and financial policies of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must not resort to verbal or active means and must be implemented in a planned manner under the command of Japan.</p>
<p>(2) A single currency within the circle is not suitable for the actual conditions of each region.</p>
<p>(3) The exchange rate between the currency of each region and the yen must fully reference the pre-war ratio. The subsequent changes, the common main materials and price levels of each region, as well as the economic strength of each region, should be fully considered when determining the rates.</p>
<p>(4) Once the exchange rate is decided, it is best to keep it as fixed as possible and not change it again.</p>
<p>(5) The funds for expanding production in various regions must not rely solely on Japan's supply, but should be coordinated locally as much as possible.</p>
<p>Tsuneo Uchida—Manchuria</p>
<p>Regarding the price issue in Manchuria, the resolution of the following three items is very important:</p>
<p>(1) The implementation of the Five-Year Industrial Plan and prices;</p>
<p>(2) Countermeasures to deal with the impact of special price phenomena in adjacent regions;</p>
<p>(3) Maintaining low prices for important exports to Japan.</p>
<p>The emphasis must be placed on these three points before the integrated economy of Japan and Manchuria can be achieved.</p>
<p>Ouyang Zaixiang—North China</p>
<p>(1) The reason why prices in North China are more expensive compared to Japan and Manchuria is due to the sharp drop in prices in legal tender, the low level of productivity, the undetermined economic circle in North China, and inflation.</p>
<p>(2) However, in the financial aspect, the financial institution management rules have already been implemented. Therefore, the prices of commodities other than the main food products have been suppressed.</p>
<p>(3) The current problem is the rising price of food, daily necessities, etc. This is because the above-mentioned items must rely on foreign countries. Therefore, we are now urgently seeking to establish a self-sufficient circle in North China. If this can be successful, all problems will be solved.</p>
<p>Shen Wenbing—Mengjiang</p>
<p>(1) The reasons for the high prices in Mengjiang are due to the impact of legal tender prices outside the region, the expansion of Meng currency, and the sluggishness of exports.</p>
<p>(2) As a countermeasure to the above-mentioned phenomena, price and purchase controls are being strictly implemented. In the financial aspect, emphasis is being placed on financing, absorbing purchasing power, unifying financial institutions, and controlling remittances.</p>
<p>(3) Because of imports, prices in Mengjiang are higher than in other regions. Therefore, it has been decided to control the import and export of materials, adjust their prices, and strive to be a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Pan Tingwu—Guangdong</p>
<p>Lin Jichuan—Xiamen</p>
<p>(1) For the sake of the stability of the lives of the people in Central and Southern China, we hope to revive remittances from overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>(2) The current situation of unsmooth material exchanges, we hope to dredge them within the possible range, and hope to give a comprehensive characteristic to the extremely isolated economies of the current regions.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Will Levy a Baojia Surtax Starting This Year, the Tax Rate is 10% of the House Tax, the Baojia Voluntary Donation Will Be Discontinued From Today</h3>
<p>French Authorities Bulletin No. 1 states that the Baojia voluntary donation will no longer be collected from today. For this reason, all Lianbao, Bao, and Jia personnel are not allowed to collect Baojia donations in any way in the future. However, starting from January 1, 1943, a Baojia surtax will be established separately and paid at the same time as the house tax. The tax rate for taxpayers to pay the surtax is, in principle, 10% of the house tax, which will be collected by the French Municipal Council's Donation Office. Those who violate this will please report to the nearest police station immediately. This bulletin.</p>
<h3>The Public Concession Economic Police Department Is Assigned to Mr. Gotō Concurrently as Director</h3>
<p>According to well-informed sources, after the two concession police forces strengthened their police force last year and achieved remarkable results in dealing with crimes related to financial and other issues, the French Concession will also add a similar organization. The relevant authorities will make further efforts starting this spring to make the security in the concession more solid. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Planned to Establish in the Near Future</p>
<p>According to already confirmed news, the Public Concession Upper Bureau Police Department plans to establish an Economic Police Department in the near future. The director will be concurrently held by the Deputy Police Chief Gotō. Once established, crimes related to economic and financial issues will be handled by the department. For example, the speculators who were arrested in the gold market in the second half of last year will be directly handled by the department in the future. As for the shops that exceed the price limit, the illegal merchants who hoard goods, and others who knowingly disrupt the people's livelihood and still seek their own profiteering, it is heard that the newly established Economic Police Department will investigate, arrest, and punish them in the future.</p>
<p>Staff Recruited from Japan</p>
<p>Because the establishment of the Economic Police Department is sufficient to suppress prices and maintain the normal life of the general public, the residents of this port hope that such a plan can be realized as soon as possible. It is also heard that the Public Concession Police Department will recruit some of the staff of the Economic Police Department from Japan, and the other part will be trained in this port. As for the French Concession, it is heard that it will follow in the footsteps of the Public Concession. After the Public Concession establishes the Economic Police Department, the French Police Department will also add a similar organization.</p>
<h3>Talk by the Japanese Ambassador at a Reception</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: The Japanese Embassy in this city, as per usual practice, held a reception for the Chinese press corps of this city at the Cathay Hotel yesterday (the 6th) at 3:00 PM. More than ten reporters from various newspapers in this city attended. From the embassy side, Information Minister Hirota, accompanied by Vice-Consul Fuku, attended on time. During the reception, they exchanged views on the recent world situation over the past week and held cordial discussions for a long time. Regarding the recent frequent rumors of Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the United States, Information Minister Hirota also provided a detailed critique. He said that although there had been rumors about Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the United States, its possibility would await factual proof. If Chiang Kai-shek were indeed to make this trip to the United States, he would offer the following points: Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the United States would inevitably be to request the United States to step up its aid with a large amount of military supplies and to open up transportation routes. Chiang Kai-shek's blind resistance war is self-aware of being stuck in a quagmire from which he cannot extricate himself, and deeply feels that his days are numbered. The United States' aid to Chiang Kai-shek is merely Roosevelt's perfunctory trick. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek is making this trip to lobby American political circles, hoping to obtain a dream of massive aid. At the same time, due to the blockade of the Burma Road, transportation has been greatly hampered, and this is to open up a new path. Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States have suffered major blows. For example, the United States has suffered heavy losses in naval battles on islands such as the Solomon Islands and Hawaii, to the point where they cannot be recovered. At the same time, the Allied forces of Britain and the United States have repeatedly suffered defeats in North Africa and are unable to take care of themselves. How can they plan to aid Chiang Kai-shek? Therefore, this visit by Chiang Kai-shek will certainly be difficult to fulfill. As the Axis forces win victory after victory, they will inflict major blows on the United Nations. Therefore, Britain and the United States also know that they cannot extricate themselves and have no hope of victory. They are putting on a show to ease public sentiment regarding Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the United States. The Allied front has already revealed its predicament, and its collapse is not far off, and so on. The reception ended with refreshments at 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Broadcasting Supervision Office Reiterates Radio Regulations</h3>
<p>The head of the Japanese Broadcasting Supervision Office recently reiterated the regulations regarding the control of wireless radios recently issued by the Japanese authorities, and warned all owners of wireless radios to pay close attention to these regulations.</p>
<p>All Radios with Seven or More Tubes Are Prohibited</p>
<p>It is said that all wireless radios with seven or more tubes, whether longwave or shortwave, must be registered at Room 316, Hardoon Building, Nanjing Road. According to their explanation, these wireless radios are within the scope prohibited by the Japanese government. Wireless radios with seven or more tubes (whether longwave or shortwave) should pay attention to the notices issued by the Broadcasting Supervision Office in the newspapers, so as to pay the prescribed location in accordance with the regulations. It is said that no one will be granted the right to possess radios with seven or more tubes. After you register with the government, we will take over. Anyone who violates the rules will be dealt with in accordance with military law.</p>
<p>Manufacturing and Transportation Must Be Approved</p>
<p>It is disclosed that some residents will submit application forms to the Broadcasting Supervision Office, but these letters will not be accepted. It is said that "those who occupy strictly prohibited wireless radios will be driven to areas outside the registration area, and application letters are useless." As for radios with six tubes or less, they must hold an official registration certificate, but they must cut off their shortwave. At the same time, if there is a miscalculation of the number of tubes, it must be directly submitted to the Broadcasting Supervision Office for verification. According to their statement, this regulation includes those who registered with the police last summer. Those who want to manufacture, use, occupy, and transport radios should apply for approval from the police departments of the two concessions. Japanese residents must apply to the Japanese consulate.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Postpones Its Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>Establishing a Beijing Language Research Class to Facilitate Japanese People to Become Familiar with the Shanghai Dialect</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, since its establishment on January 29th last year, has reached its second anniversary on January 29th this year. According to the regulations, a general membership meeting should be convened to re-elect directors and supervisors.

The executive committee has decided to find a suitable location for the association. Also, the candidates for the vacant positions of directors and supervisors must first be considered in advance for submission to the general meeting for election. Therefore, it was not possible to hold the meeting as scheduled and it must be postponed until all the procedures have been prepared.

Classes are scheduled to begin on January 7th, starting with the national phonetic alphabet. Japanese people who are interested in studying Beijing language can register to participate.</p>
<h3>China Central Railway Company Tests New-Type Trains</h3>
<p>The China Central Railway Company has begun construction of two types of heavy-duty lifting cars weighing 45 tons and "coal and gas-fueled cars." The former's construction broke the record of China's heavy industry, while the latter's manufacturing is the first in the world. The two new cars were tested at the North Railway Station the other day, and the results were satisfactory. The "coal and gas-fueled car" was manufactured by the Wusong Factory of the China Central Railway Company, using both coal and gas to replace the scarce gasoline. This type of vehicle can travel from Wusong to Jiaxing, a distance of 114 kilometers, in 2 hours and 52 minutes, with a speed of approximately 50 kilometers per hour. The crane car was built by the Changzhou Railway Factory, with a speed of 42 kilometers per hour.

<h3>Recent Situation of the Zhendong Agricultural Village Run by Overseas Chinese from Canada in Kunshan</h3>
<p>The Zhendong Agricultural Village is located in Xianglu Township, Third District, Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province. In 1926, overseas Chinese from the United States and Canada raised more than 600,000 yuan to purchase more than 3,000 mu of land there and build more than 61 Western-style houses and more than 20 fish ponds. The current market value of the farmland is estimated at about 7 to 8 million yuan. After the August 13th Incident, the villagers took refuge elsewhere, and the fields were devastated. Later, representatives of the village, Huang Chouli and Huang Baiman, and others appealed to the committee to find a way to recover the village so that they could move back to live there. Subsequently, Committee Member Chen Jicheng sent Committee Member Hui Ling to Kunshan County Government and negotiated with the local garrison to assist in the matter. As a result, the property was returned to its original owners. Thereupon, the overseas Chinese villagers moved back to live there one after another. Later, He Zhuoyan and others raised funds to establish a planting company to cultivate the wasteland in the village, and the harvest was very abundant. Recently, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's office in Shanghai specially sent Commissioner Zhang Yuan and others to inspect the village and conduct overseas Chinese registration there. More than 200 people registered. Commissioner Zhang and others returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to reports, the order in the village has been restored. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, foreign exchange has been suspended, and the village's economic sources have been greatly affected. Now the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's office in Shanghai will lease 20 wastelands in the village to the overseas Chinese merchants Guangzhong Company to engage in fish farming to increase production.</p>

<h3>On the Timeliness of Winter Relief</h3>
<p>— Tang Xiongfeng</p>
<p>The vagrant group who are unable to solve their own food, clothing, and shelter, every winter, public and private charitable organizations and benevolent people hold winter relief for them, to help them through the "hunger and cold" crisis. This was the case last year, and this is the case this year. Even since the incident, it has never been interrupted. Especially in years of social upheaval and turmoil, it is even more worthy of praise and congratulations for the wandering refugees. However, this year's winter relief work seems to be not only deserted but also somewhat slow, and even has the regret of "digging a well when thirsty!" For example, the Shanghai Municipal 31st Year Winter Relief Fundraising Committee is undoubtedly a main force for this winter's "winter relief," but at present, the candidates for the committee members have just been determined and are yet to be established. Also, the temporary cold shelters established by the Shanghai Westside Poor Relief Association have only just been completed, and the other two or three shelters that are planned are still in the process of searching for open space. But in terms of seasons, it is only one month away from "Beginning of Spring," and the current temperature records have dropped below 50 degrees Fahrenheit several times. The roads have been iced over, and it should be entering the "severe winter" stage. But the crowds of people who are starving and unable to cover their bodies and who are homeless were already beginning to experience "hunger and cold" under the first wave of cold air when people were taking off their "autumn coats," and they were beginning to collapse from the cold and hunger!</p>
<p>This fact can be seen in the collection reports of the Pushan Villa; in the first "cold spell" of every winter, the number of corpses on the road suddenly increases! Therefore, the fact tells us that the feeling of cold for the average person, especially for benevolent people, has a "temporal" difference from the perception of the suffering vagrant group. In the different environmental encounters with each other, the "winter relief" of previous years has often created a record of "arriving late and leaving early!"</p>
<p>Now that the 31st year winter relief work is just beginning, we hope that it will be carried out quickly so that it will not be delayed too much, considering the "temporal" nature of "winter." At the same time, we hope that it can be advanced in the 32nd year to achieve the perfect effect of being "timely" and "effective." We hope that benevolent people from all walks of life can show compassion for the suffering group at the turn of autumn and winter "when the atmosphere has cooled but is not yet cold," and generously donate to relieve their suffering.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament, three games in Group A last night, fought at the China Youth Gymnasium. In the first game, Xing Ren played against Tong Ren. The former's strength was exceptionally strong, and the team's cooperation was particularly tacit. Therefore, they led the way throughout the game. As a result, they defeated Tong Ren with a score of 37 to 27. Next, Lian Xing and the Ice Team took the stage. Lian Xing originally had the ambition to win the championship. Unfortunately, they had already lost to Xing Ren last week. The absence of Nei Xi's players Tao Bolin, Ji Qiang, and Du Lai was again poisoned by Monocle, and their morale was suddenly挫折. Therefore, in yesterday's battle with the Ice Team, they were at a disadvantage with a score of 21 to 22 in the first half. After switching sides, relying on the efforts of Chen Xuechong, Kong Guangyi, and others, they finally reversed the defeat with a score of 38 to 31. In the last game, the Red Team played against Hua Lian. It was originally thought that the former would win steadily. Unexpectedly, Hua Lian's Zhang Liangxiong performed outstandingly, which made the Red Team almost suffer a Waterloo. At the end of the first half, the Red Team led by one point with a score of 22 to 20. After the break, the two sides fought even more fiercely, and the scores rose and fell. The Red Team finally defeated Hua Lian with a difference of two points with a score of 49 to 47. In the recent situation, the Red Team has won four games in four victories, ranking first. There are no games today.</p>

<h3>Chinese Stocks Still Enveloped by Selling Pressure, Slightly Stabilized at Noon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese stock market saw a sharp drop first, then suddenly stabilized at noon. It was still enveloped by sellers seeking cash. Although there were new and old investors active seeing the low prices, they had no competitive spirit and all had the thought of absorbing at low prices. The textile industry saw the most significant first drop and then rise, probably because there was a rumor of rising yarn prices that led to the increase. Wing On Textile Factory retreated to 345 yuan, then rebounded to 365 yuan, breaking even. Dasheng No. 1 Factory reached around 390 yuan, and No. 2 Factory reached 375 yuan. Small-denomination stocks also turned stable from being flat and weak. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water and Electricity was as low as 59 yuan, then 60 yuan, a small 5 jiao. China Merchants Electric retreated from 42 yuan to 39.5 yuan, and then rebounded to 40 yuan, a small 1 yuan. The cultural industry also saw weakness. China Merchants was as low as 440 yuan, a small 5 yuan. China retreated to 160 yuan and then rebounded, a small 7.5 yuan. The World was 105 yuan, down 1 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Sinya fell another small half yuan to 25.5 yuan. Minyi fell to 62 or 63 yuan, even lower than the premium price. Sino-French New Shares fell from 27 yuan to 25.75 yuan, then rose by 1 yuan at noon, still a small 7 jiao higher. Wuzhou traded at 695 yuan, Zhongxi at 440 yuan, and Xinyi around 260 yuan. Sinya Enzyme traded at 22.5 yuan and 2 yuan. In the department store industry, the China Products Company fell to 75 or 76 yuan, New World fell to 135 yuan, and Wing On to 126 or 127 yuan, all in a slump. Great China Matches traded at 355 yuan, a small 12.5 yuan higher. Nanyang Tobacco fell from 125 yuan to 22 yuan, a small 3.5 yuan lower. Most other stocks saw declines, and transactions were scarce. The list is as follows:</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Increasingly Unsustainable, Market Prices Have No Standard</h3>
<p>Government bond market prices became increasingly unsustainable yesterday. Although it is the beginning of the year, the money market is still very tight due to the proximity of the Lunar New Year. Those holding goods need cash and have to sell their goods for money, so market prices are getting lower and lower. In themselves, they have nothing to do with income and expenditure, but are forced by the environment and the times. Yesterday, Type A traded around 1 yuan, Type B for 0.8 to 1 yuan, Type C had a high price of 2.6 yuan and a low price of 1.8 yuan, eventually settling at 2 yuan, Type D was about 0.2 or 0.3 yuan, and Type E was only 0.5 yuan. Although the prices were uniform, there were very few transactions, and most people were unwilling to do this business, so the market became narrower and narrower.</p>
<h3>Gold Ornaments Rise Slowly in the Domestic Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold jewelry market price in the city's silver and jewelry stores remained unchanged at 3,050 yuan per tael (the purchase price was reduced by 200 yuan). The inter-dealer price fluctuated and then slowly rose. In the morning, it was 2,900 yuan, up 30 yuan. It once fell back to 2,875 yuan, but soon buying interest rose again, and at noon it had risen to 2,955 yuan, an increase of 85 yuan compared to the previous day. There was usually a difference of 80 yuan, and transactions were scarce. The price was still rising later in the day, and there were few sellers. The price of silver for jewelry remained at 16 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price had risen to around 17 yuan.</p>
<p>The interest rate for interbank lending at the Money Dealers' Association remained unchanged at 1 jiao 7 fen.</p>
<h3>Military Tickets Still Flat, Allied Currency Lower</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the military ticket was flat. The inter-dealer exchange rate was between 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen and 5 fen 2 li. The buying and selling price at small money shops and silver houses was 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen half and 4 fen half. The buying and selling price of the Allied currency was 3 yuan 8 jiao and 7 jiao half, slightly lower by 5 fen, it is said.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Total Number of Foreign Bank Checks Exchanged</h3>
<p>The total amount of checks exchanged by 15 foreign banks in this city in 1942 is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Military Tickets (Unit: Thousands of Yuan)</p>
<p>January: 185,684, February: 180,615, March: 323,671, April: 241,521, May: 248,377, June: 238,636, July: 266,982, August: 240,209, September: 255,159, October: 314,722, November: 322,256, December: 252,741 (from the 1st to the 29th).</p>

<h3>Cotton Cloth Transactions Remain Scarce</h3>
<p>This morning, there were continued transactions in cotton cloth factory orders, but transactions remained scarce, and the market situation remained firm. The transaction prices for both coarse and fine cloths in department stores have risen by nearly 10 yuan each. The red order for Sijunzi cloth rose from 8 yuan 4 jiao 6 fen to 8 yuan 6 jiao 6 fen, an increase of 3 jiao 3 fen. Colored goods showed a state of having a price but no market. Taohua Nushilin was quoted at 342 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Rosin Slightly Falls</h3>
<p>About 300 pieces of miscellaneous rosin have arrived this time. Because the outflow has been relatively stagnant recently, the supply seems to be greater than the demand. Therefore, the market price is difficult to rise. Yesterday, several dozen boxes were opened in the North and South Market. The goods were average, which caused the quoted price to fall by another 20 to 30 yuan. Calculated according to the production price, it is still losing money.</p>
<h3>Ji Kuizi is Scarce and Prices are High</h3>
<p>Although there are few Ji Kuizi goods arriving, the sales have been very weak recently, so it is extremely difficult to increase the quoted price. Yesterday, there were dozens of packages of goods, the particles were still large, but the meat content was relatively poor. The counteroffer was still close to the spectrum, with a difference of 20 codes, and it was about to be成交, it is said.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Market Trend Turns Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grain transactions started lively but then turned stagnant. The market price started high and then became mediocre. It is estimated that 30 packages of Chongming beach yellow were opened, priced at 334 yuan. Another 10 packages of beach red were priced at 340 yuan. 500 Zhang Ji bean cakes were priced at 92 yuan half. Two cars of Yuanlong bean cakes were priced at 93 yuan to 93 yuan half. Three cars of Fei Zi bean cakes were priced at 94 yuan to 93 yuan half.</p>
<h3>Foreign Coins and Flat Iron</h3>
<p>Sales are Scattered</p>
<p>New foreign coins and flat iron have already been in short supply, but due to the price limit, they are difficult to be too high. However, those holding the goods are unwilling to sell. Yesterday, first-class goods were sold at 11,000 yuan per ton, and new foreign coins and flat iron were sold at 13,000 yuan per ton, and there are worries about not being able to buy goods. New angle iron was quoted at 16,000 yuan, and first-class angle iron was priced at 11,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan per ton (the colors are added appropriately).</p>
<h3>Soap and Candles Are Scarce and Prices Rise Frequently</h3>
<p>Daily necessities such as soap and candles have been rising in price continuously. Because the stock is becoming more and more depleted, there are very few sellers, and the market trend is becoming more prosperous. Matches are still relatively stable. It is estimated that the Phoenix brand is still quoted at 3,000 yuan, the Beautiful brand at 3,150 yuan, the Golden Ding brand at 2,800 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2,100 yuan. The cost of fixed soap is 5,45 yuan, Baixiangmao is 500 yuan, scissor soap is 525 yuan, and Huangxiangmao soap is 435 yuan, which is one to two yuan more expensive than last year. The price of Burberry's candles is 510 yuan, monk hat brand is 450 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 340 yuan.</p>

<h3>The "Death" Heavier Than Mount Tai</h3>
<p>— Peng Liu</p>
<p>The Creator seems to arrange the life process of all living things with a playful attitude: birth, aging, illness, and death. All living things cannot escape this process. Even mankind, the spirit of all things, cannot avoid death. Therefore, "death" has become the only final destination for all mankind and even the entire biological world. Because of this, "death" is the most ordinary yet most mysterious event in life.</p>
<p>We all know that most deaths are due to illness. Besides, we sometimes hear people say that a certain old man passed away without any illness. So generally speaking, there are only two reasons for death: death due to illness is illness-related death, and death without illness in old age can be called death from old age.</p>
<p>Speaking of the changes in the physiological mechanisms of these two types of death, we must first explore some physiological conditions. The death of the body is first caused by the individual death of a certain important organ in the body. There are many organs in the body, among which the most important and dominant are the heart and nerves. All organs in the body rely on the heart to transport nutrients and remove waste, and are also managed by the nerves to produce various physiological functions. When the heart dies and stops working, the body's blood circulation also stops. As a result, the cells in all parts of the body gradually die due to lack of nutrients, and the organs also die as a result. When the nerves die, the heart and other organs lose their control and die one by one. Speaking of the death of the heart and nerves themselves: when the heart is dying, its lower part slows down first, while the upper part remains normal. Then the lower part becomes completely static, while the movement of the upper part gradually decreases. Then the left half of the upper part gradually stops, while the right half can still beat. Finally, the right half also becomes static, and the entire heart becomes still. Before the death of a nerve, its function must be higher than usual (the so-called 'glow of vitality' before death is also the case), but after a moment, it quickly decreases until it completely disappears. Among all the nervous systems, the brain dies first and fastest, and its function disappears in an instant, followed by the spinal cord, and finally the peripheral nerves, and the further away from the brain, the slower its function disappears.</p>
<p>Returning to the above two causes of death, death from illness is mostly due to the death of the heart first, which then causes the death of other organs, while death from old age is mostly due to the death of the brain first. The death of the heart in death from illness is either due to external damage (such as bacterial toxins in infectious diseases) or due to toxins produced in the body due to pathological changes, which cause the heart to be poisoned and die. As for death from old age, it is because the brain is the most easily aging tissue, and it eventually dies after a lifetime of hard work.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that everyone can die from illness. If one can always stay healthy and not get sick, one will eventually die from old age. Sooner or later, death is inevitable. Furthermore, for our own sake, we should maintain health and not get sick. We would rather let the body die naturally from old age than be invaded by "toxins" into the heart and "die from the heart." Furthermore, life and death are a universal principle throughout the ages. If we want to live, we must prepare for death, and we must not die lighter than a feather, but die heavier than Mount Tai. This is the "death" that makes mankind superior to other creatures, and this is the death that is extraordinary and not mysterious.</p>
<h3>Huxley on the Question of Human Immortality — One of the Letters of World-Renowned Scientists</h3>
<p>— Translated by Lincoln Schuster, written by Gu Xin</p>
<p>Life will not exist without some conformity of the individual to the surrounding universe—that conformity involving a certain quantity of happiness over pain. Simply said, we live, we get the price of living.</p>
<p>When we fail to see the obvious discrepancy between human activities and their rewards, we must remember that nature is fairer than we are. She records what a person brings to the world, which human fairness cannot do. If I am born a brutal thug, inheriting all kinds of evil traits from others, and kill you, my fellow human being, of course my fellow human beings will fairly hang me, but I will be spared that terrible regret. If my nature is higher, and I do the same thing, regret will certainly be my true punishment.</p>
<p>The absolute fairness of the system of things seems to me as clear as any scientific fact. The attraction of sin to sorrow is as certain as the attraction of the earth to the sun, and even more certain, because the factual proof is accessible to all of us—no, as long as we have eyes to see, it is clearly placed before our eyes.</p>
<p>Therefore, I not only believe in rewarding behavior, but I also believe that seeking rewards and punishments after death will cause people to completely ignore the fact that their inevitable rewards and punishments are in this world.</p>
<p>If anticipating hell in the afterlife would make me do bad things, then, of course, the certainty of hell in this world would even more make me not do bad things. If a person can certainly have an impression, believing that being a thief will harm himself, just like swallowing arsenic (which is indeed the case), then isn't the power of this belief to dissuade wrongdoing greater than the power based on rewards in the afterlife?</p>
<p>I am not an optimist for the first teaching, but I have the most solid belief that the divine government (assuming we use such a name to represent the totality of 'physical habits') is perfectly fair. The more I know about other people's lives (not to mention my own), the more I understand that the wicked will not prosper and the good will not be punished. However, for the sake of clarity, we must remember in our hearts those things that have been almost completely forgotten, that is, the rewards of life, as long as they comply with all the laws—physical and moral—will be obtained from time to time, but moral compliance cannot redeem physical sins, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The Supreme God's general ledger is strictly recorded, and everything that everyone does is settled clearly at the end of every minute of his existence.</p>
<p>This reminds me of another point.</p>
<p>That day, I stood behind my young son's coffin, and there was no anxiety in my heart. The pastor, according to his duties, read these words: 'If the dead do not rise, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.' I cannot tell you how indescribably these words shocked me. Paul had neither a wife nor children, otherwise he would have known that his words simply desecrated everything that is best and noblest in human nature. I could laugh scornfully. What! Because I personally encountered irreparable losses, because I have returned the cause of great happiness to the source from which it came, and still maintain in my life the various blessings that sprang or will spring from that cause, should I look down on my humanity, roar, and degenerate to beastliness? Ah, even apes know much more. If you shoot their young, they will also wail and cry, and will not immediately hide in the canyon.</p>

<h3>Teacher of All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>A great joke, a joke that has been told for a long time—but also a somewhat sad joke. Chips sat by the fireplace, the autumn storm shaking the windows. Waves of laughter and sorrow swept over him from time to time, until his tears fell. Therefore, when Mrs. Wickett brought in the tea, she simply did not know whether he had been laughing or crying there. I am afraid Chips himself could not understand it either.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Brookfield was across the road, behind a row of old elm trees, covered with vines and the like, turning reddish in the autumn light. A group of nineteenth-century houses, concentrated around a square courtyard, in addition to many acres of sports fields; further on was the small village established on this basis, and the open swampy countryside. As Wetherby said, Brookfield was an old foundation, a small school established in the Elizabethan era. If it had been luckier, it might have been as famous as Harrow. However, it was not so lucky. It went through twists and turns, at one time almost disappeared, and at another time almost shone brightly and could compete with other schools. It was in these later, constantly fluctuating periods that the main building was renovated and a large number of additions were made, during the reign of the first King George. Later, after the Napoleonic Wars, until the mid-Victorian era, it declined again in terms of numbers and reputation. Wetherby came in 1840, and he finally restored some of its fortunes; however, it has never been raised to the first rank since then. But it is still a good school of the second rank. Several prominent families supported it; it produced the great figures who made history in the contemporary era—judges, parliamentarians, colonial administrators, and a few nobles and bishops. However, it produced the most merchants, manufacturers, and professional talents, and not a few squires and parish priests. Some schools, when people mention their names, general exaggerators will say that they seem to have heard of this school, to show their broad knowledge. Brookfield is somewhat like such a school.</p>
<p>But if it were not such a school, it might not have hired Chips. Because Chips, in any social or academic sense, was just like Brookfield, slightly famous but not very reputable. (Four)</p>
