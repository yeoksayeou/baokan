<p>社評</p>
<h3>朝氣與暮氣</h3>
<p>古人有兩句成語。叫做「如日之昇」，一日暮途窮」，我們知道前者形容日昇時的光　興盛，也就是「朝氣」，。後者形容日垂時的黯淡沒落，也就是「暮氣」。更具體的說，「朝氣」就是有堅定的信念，有積極求進步的精神，有勇於革新的決心。「暮氣」就是缺乏自信力，抱具消極的茍安心理，在在的自暴自棄。</p>
<p>朝氣或暮氣的表現，不僅在個人態度上很易窺測，就是民族與國家也同樣的極易暴路。一個民族與國家，有了朝氣，其國勢必然强盛無疑。並可從下列現象騐證。：</p>
<p>政府與人民之間，必能打成一片。政府信任人民，人民擁護政府，政府是有堅定的信念，積極求進步的精神，勇於革新的決心，它的措施，永遠站在人民福利的尖端，忠實為人民服務。有了這樣有朝氣的政府，人民自然城信誠服的支援擁護了。</p>
<p>政府隨時隨地為人民福利打算，為國家久遠之計打算。凡是與國家人民有利的事，不論鉅細，不辭艱難，悉力以赴。</p>
<p>人民在政府領導之下，遵從法令，切頭苦幹，共謀國家的生存，進而臻於强盛的境地。</p>
<p>例如日本與德國，無　國家與人民方面，都顯出蓬勃的州氣。政府全為人民利益打算，人民忠誠接受政府指揮，各盡本職。齊一步驟，向建國之途邁進。</p>
<p>至於個人生活也是如此，具有彭氣者，他的生活必然蓬勃奮發治事有計劃，有條理，不斷求取進步，對於民族國家，有愛護的信念，理智的判別。</p>
<p>反之，一個民族興國家，如果有了暮氣，共國勢必然衰頹敗亂無疑。也可從下列現象騐證：</p>
<p>因政府的設施，不能為人民和益打算，或是重於私利的官吏佔據政府要津。人民對於政府抱具若即若難的熊虔，於是兩者之間，隔有鴻溝，政府不肯信任人民，不能給予人民參加政治的機會。於是人民懷疑政府，甚至不能赤心擁護政府。</p>
<p>政府的行政設施，毫無切合國情的計劃，縱有計劃，不是好高驚遠行不通的迂闊之論，就是不去實施的紙上計劃，或是口頭計劃。因循敷衍，結果人民安居樂業，無法保障，也就不會感到有政府的好處，對於政府的觀念十分淡薄。</p>
<p>人民旣無無參與政治的機會，一切意思無從有效地上達，政府自政府，人民自人民。政府無久遠之計為人民謀幸福，人民因而失望，因而消沉，逐漸養成自私自利的個人主義，而以投機取巧為生活乎段，此種趨勢愈烈，民族與國家的前途就愈為不振。</p>
<p>至於暮氣的個人生活也是如此，對事無計劃，得過且過，所謂「只顧自己門前雪，不管人家瓦上霜」。聊自解嘲日「明哲保身」。同時，唯利是圖，動輙交爭，不講是非。上面我們所說的，是一般的　釋「朝氣」與「慕氣」的內容與分　，及其外貌的表現，民旋與國家如此，個人也莫不如此。</p>
<p>我們中華民國的民族國家以至於個人，今天的現狀怎樣？是朝氣的？還是暮氣的？希望政府與人民大家以目靜思，深深的反省一下，如果自覺屬於暮氣的，那來，要毫不掩飾的痛自針砭。剷除暮氣，建立朝氣。</p>
<p>以剷除暮氣，建立朝氣之道，我們認為急其所急，政府實應首先積極振作，如果政府事事振奪，充溢朝氣，就不愁人民不會振作，不具朝氣。政府有朝氣，必先積極的實行幾件大事，幾件確實為國為民的火事。囚為關係國計民生的大事，政府不先積極實行，人民依舊存着觀望態度，消極的「等待機會」。怎樣實行幾件大事呢？我們可以列舉一二：</p>
<p>政治原是關係人民大衆的事，原則上必須公開，准許人民共同參加意見，以期集思廣益，舉措悉當。政府准許人民參政的前提，必先具備實質的與民史始之誠意，徒具形式，還是落空。「先國後黨」，尤應為執政黨必有的信念，如重慶政權的「先黨後國」，最後必趨失敗。</p>
<p>只會做官，不會做事，是近數十年國事蜩螗的主因。所以，澈底革除官僚玫治，樹立專家政治與廉潔政治。從速強化者試與銓叙的用人制度。</p>
<p>仇成和平運動，必先　極從事建國工作，協力參戰勝利，也必先積極從事建國工作。因為建國是最基本的工作，國家有了力量，和平運動才可順利的達成，協力參戰，才有實際效果。建國工作，第一，從增加農工生產入手，一方面主管機關切實執行增產計畫，一方面竭力消除一切增產上的障礙。其次，運用全力全面的抑平物價，尤其是消滅人為的原因。</p>
<p>我們竭誠呼　政府與人民，舉國一致的振作，每個人具有朝氣精神，無庸諱言的，近年一般人民有一種錯覺，認為「時局必將變化」，祇須等待，機會必至。可是，我們試想，大東亞戰爭一年九個月以來，時局如何變化？等待得到什麽好機會，如果再因循等待，也許物價再高，生活更艱，我們的機會，一定要用積極的朝氣精神去迎接的；絕對不是消極的暮氣態度可以坐待得到的，而坐待所可得到的，却是物價更高生活史艱的痛苦而已。就市實而言，「柬亞局面早巳奠定，只有發展，決不會變化」了。英美殘餘勢力，決不會在東亞死灰復燃了。我們只有大家振作，督促政府，擁護政府，協力友邦日木爭取大東亞戰爭勝利，達到眞正的機會——「安居樂業」！</p>

<p>南京十四日中央社電　本年三月糧食部召開食糧增產會議，以謀確保　方軍　，安寂後方民生，議決各案，切實付諸實施，茲悉糧食部為策進今後通一步之規劃，已擬定食糧增產全面動員辦法，由中央與各省市縣區鄕鎭保甲分別訂期舉行食糧增產策進會議，在中央方面由糧食部召集，各省市建設總長，糧食局長，及各有關機關主管技術人員，及外籍經濟顧問，于九月十五日在京舉行會議。在省市方面由各省市長召集主管總局長縣長及區署長及有關機　技術人員，及有關外籍顧問，于九月二十日舉行全省市會議，再由縣長或區署長召集區鄕鎭長及有關機關于九月二十五晶舉行全縣或各區會議，再由各區鄕鎭長召集保甲長于九月二十八日舉行保甲會議。此次糧食部策動之各級食　　會在使中央糧政領導于上，地方糧政協於下，上下一心，共同協力糧食高度之管理，必能獲得美滿成績。</p>

<h3>渝舉行　十一中全會</h3>

<p>柏林于四日中央社電　關於墨索里尼遇救事，十三日傍晚德外交部發表稱：　統帥自七月廿五日被却持後，即輾轉各地，於一週　　撒丁島附近小島移至　本土後，始被德軍救出。蓋巴豆特里奧政權對墨氏之監視極嚴密，即關於其所在地亦極為秘密，且第經兩日或三日，即用盡一切手段，將墨氏移至加一島之兵營或移至軍艦上，並動員大批重要兵隊嚴防洩漏秘密。但德軍雖在此嚴密之警戒下，終於發現　統帥最後之所在，此僅為三四天前之事。希特勒元首於得悉此訉後，即時命令　衛隊大尉　除萬難，營救墨統帥。墨統帥乃於一　前始由撒丁島附近之小島移至義本土，被拘於荒僻之山中，監視隊亦逐漸增多，德親　隊大尉親率德軍精銳及降落傘部隊，於十二日拂暁奪勇出動前往營救，逐即奪勇突入虎穴，實行奇襲，終將墨統帥救出，該警備隊本已受命於墨氏被人營救時，即刻將其槍殺，但此次德軍出於迅雷不及掩耳之手段，已值敵人措手不及，墨氏被救出後，未受微傷，即搭飛抵義本土某大都市。墨統帥安扺該處後，即以電話通知德元首行營，於是希墨兩氏即以電話作米羅那會談以來時隔已久之初次通話。綜觀此事變，其情節離奇，實過於小說傳記也，又墨統帥並已與相別六週同破監禁之家屬等晤面，但因精神體力過於疲勞、故於晤面後即酣眠逹數小時之久。墨統帥遇救之消息傳至義國後，義國內即刻掀起一法西斯復興」運動，黑　隊亦出現街頭，法西斯黨旗亦已飄揚於各邵市，又被德軍救出之法西斯黨領袖及前閣僚等亦頻頻與墨統帥會晤，至是法西斯新政府再建之氣勢　更趨尖躍。墨統帥於此數十日之監禁生活中，因消息隔絕，關於最近國際情勢及世界戰局之演變，全然不暁，但咸認墨統帥於于三日農聆及各方面之情形後，必愈燃起再建新政府之雄心，首將選拔法西斯黨內有為及熱血愛國之領袖人物，組織非常時期內閣，同時更將綱羅義軍之精銳師團，重整法西斯軍隊。據德外交部施密特博士宣稱：因墨統帥之東山再起，樹立法西斯國民政府運動已步入新階段，而有再加檢討之必要，　因墨統帥　將赴德元首行　會晤希特勒元首，故墨統帥組織新政府，統領法西斯軍而顯示重整旗鼓之活躍情形，將於該會見後即可分暁。</p>

<p>義軍繳械順利進行</p>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　當　軍將駐在希臘北部義軍繳械時，義軍司令因郃棄巴特里奧之叛逆行動，故投降德軍，並使德軍之命令順利執行。在哥林庫區大部份之義軍順繼續與德携手作戰。在伯羅奔尼撤方面義軍之檄械並無意外發生，有數法西斯墨衫軍及交大利陸軍宣佈仍效忠於德義聯盟，在　特尼格羅面德軍繼續向海岸前進，甚多之黑衫師團參加德軍之部隊一　，德軍捕獲七艘　輪，該船乃自沉以封鎖港口者，該港口亦被德軍佔領，在拜里厄斯港之義大利海軍船舶及商船，於九日被德軍所佔有。義魚雷艇之水手自動參加德軍。在雅典及拜里厄斯之義海軍數千人，已宣佈願與德軍繼續共同作戰之意志。德摩托化部隊於十日進駐阿爾巴尼亞京城，泰蘭納人民夾道歡迎，表示願與德軍合作</p>

<p>東京于四日中央社電　日政府認巴特里奧政權之投降，顯係對日本之敵對行為，業於九日下午發表聲明，闡明日政府之態度，一面對於僑居日本之義人及其財產等，亦決依據所定方針，迅速採了必要措置，　對於義駐日外交官員及一般義僑，決定將其拘留監視，陰斷彼等與處界之交通等，　停止船舶方面貨物已採取適當之措置，　在金融關係方面，亦中止與義人有關之外幣借換手續。</p>

<p>柏林十四日中央社電　德軍當局十三日發表東綫戰况如次：蘇軍開始攻勢以來，已歷十　，今又在南部地區以勁旅開始大規模攻勢，此次攻勢或將繼續至雨季泥濘期、德軍各地部隊已察知蘇軍此種企圖，預籌對策，任蘇軍　何執拗來犯，均予以　　。現在唐　資地區數　已將突入德軍陣地之蘇軍後路切斷，使其先後失去連絡，已陷入重圍，現該方面正展開激烈戰鬥，詳細戰况尚未判明。卡科夫西方及科諾托普近郊戰綫，亦呈膠着狀態，十二日南部地區德軍會擊毀蘇軍坦克車八十三輛，又維亞茲馬球西方，德軍亦正對蘇軍猛烈抵抗。</p>
<p>柏林于四日中央社電　　通社軍事記者塞，留斯稱：東綫中南路蘇軍所施壓力，至週末為止托仍極重大，預料在秋季泥濘季開始以前，蘇方將繼續進攻不已。但大致而論，目前東綫之局勢　已略見鬆弛，此蓋由於德軍拼力反攻，已能包圍並切斷敵軍前鋒之故。尤以亞　夫海與唐納資中游間以及卡科夫以西及以南一帶，德裝甲部隊建功最偉，敵軍向波爾太伐（Poltava）及克拉斯諾格拉（Krasnograd）之進攻均無進　，此一阻隔陣綫之德軍，　向西撒、阻隔之任務旣逐漸完成、陣綫之範圍亦漸小，科諾托普以西戰事富流分理動性，戰綫交錯，雖以確定，同時蘇軍又電向白里安斯克進攻，並對狄斯邪（Desna）上游基洛夫以西加緊壓力，斯摩稜斯克區局勢未變。</p>
<p>柏林于四日中央社電　德國新聞社訉：蘇軍星期日在德軍狄斯那陣綫之右　獲得若干成功，蘇軍以强大部隊藉急迫砲火之掩護，越過狄斯那河，而在河之西邊建立橋頭堡一座，但聞初閃避蘇軍猛攻之德軍部隊，終於阻止蘇軍擴大其初步之成功，於下午近晚扺逹突破點之德軍後備兵，終於收復為敵人所奪去之地方一處，並縮小其橋頭堡，其他蘇軍渡河之企圖均受阻，紅軍死傷甚多。</p>

<h3>滬市配給米　仍亟待接濟　據聞若干困難已經解決市糧局向中儲行借款三千萬元</h3>
<p>糧食部第二世撥給本市民食米十五萬包、其中指定由蘇松常嘉區撥發之十萬包，一度因繳故等手續問題，未能如期啓運。茲據上海社記者探悉，偶然發生之若干困難，　下均已解決。米糧聯營社即再派員專程前往發區將米運輸來滬，接濟民食需要。</p>
<p>運輸責任問題繳款先後問題</p>
<p>查糧食部所撥之食米十五萬包，係度八月份名下，其中計蘇·松、常·嘉·區十萬包、南京區三萬包，揚州區二萬包。除指定由米糧聯營社運輪蘇松常嘉之十萬包外，　揚兩區之五萬包連同第一批湖州區·未運之一萬入千七百九十包，總共六萬八千餘包則歸單中米殼配給組合運輸，與米糧聯營社分別辦理。</p>
<p>上海社記者所悉，糧食部對於撥給地方之米糧，素定先繳款後啓運之原則。第一批所撥滬來，因經陳市長商准，暫許先運後級。至於第二批撥米，則本既定之原則，乃以籌款不易，啓運之期途致遷延，而今種種困難以解決明矣。據自另一方面探悉，本市關係當局對於運米須先籌款付淸一點，確予部重考慮，卒由區主管機關向銀行　借鉅·以　周轉，故二批食米之運愉，日內即可開始進行。</p>
<p>聯營社之存廢糧統會之觀點</p>

<p>米糧統制委員會於本月十一日舉行預備會議，十二日始召開首次籌備會議，十三日上下午復分別舉行談話會與二次籌備會議。粽合三日會議議程，以蘇浙皖三省米殼統一收買問題為中心，經中日雙方與會人十　談結果。認為應自採購及運愉兩者為出發現。華方當局固須竭盡全責，友邦方面尤宜撤底協助。據上海社記者所知·該會已將運日會議所得，報告關係上級富局，請示機宜，日內將再開會商討籌備進行事宜。</p>
<p>糧局借款經過</p>
<p>市糧食局為市區公聯與中央儲備銀行成立鉅額借款三千萬元，中央社記者昨特走訪該局局長張顯之·詢借款用途及經過情形，承發表談話如次，「本局於去年一月成立，僅領得開辦費拾二萬元，並無領米資金，蓋以當時所需食米，係由糧食管理委員會先予撥發公糶完學，始行解償。並因右一部份棧存民米，可收實利用，故無需大宗整款。旋以出米辦法變更、須先付款，本局送需備鉅額資金，始克週轉，乃向中央儲備銀行上海分行借貸款項。籍資應付。第一次借款計儲幣八百萬元，係於去年十一月十七日由前任巫局長呈奉布府核准。至今年二月上旬，本人繼長斯局，因每期米量與米價增加，需款較多，會先後呈准市府，於三月一日續借六百萬元。並於五月一日，又借四百萬元。總計前後三次，共借一千八百萬元，藉此挹注，公糶方面得如期舉行。直至八月上旬以後·米借趨增，原有貧金益難應付，不得已，是明市府唱將前所積欠之一千八百萬元全數償淸，他於八月十九日另行向中儲行訂立三干萬元之新備款，此為本局向中儲行借款之經過情形。關於借款用途，如款項收付及糧食進出賬目，因該行派有專員駐局，知之甚詳。此外每旬將各種統計表填送該行，以便參考。又本局辦理公　，最近雖公軸日　略有延誤，得中織行協助借款，當可指置裕如。茲巳另訂各公糶處收付款項辦法，定自二十三期起實行，俾使周轉靈活，如麻袋保證金等凍結各部。亦設法備量减少，總期不致再有延誤情事，以副民望。」等語。</p>

<h3>鹽務署議決　食鹽供應辦法　水陸並運暢通來源監銷仍歸裕華公司</h3>
<p>財政部鹽務署對民衆食緊問題，頗為關懷，感覽目下滬地各處，因運輸問題，到貨稀少，面一般無知商人，乘機活蹤、擅自抬高市價·有碍民生，故對食鹽之產運銷三點，有改善之必要，特在南京署中，召集右關機關及興　公司舉行　議，商討改善辦法，到阮署長，劉副署長，　秘書，龔科長及蘇浙皖鹽稅　局劉局長，加藤副局長，松江品　務管理局陳局長，薛課長，海州區鹽務管理局外間副局長，曁華中鹽業公司楊董事，羅董事，森田董事，太田課長，裕華鹽業公司憚董事，陳課長，大內顧問等。</p>

<p>解釋現狀　又本市食鹽問題，巾央社記者昨特走訪松江區鹽後管理局負責人，據告：（來食鹽因運　未暢，到貨稀少，而一般業外私販，作非法買賣，以致發生黑市現象，殊為抱憾。此事財部頗為關注，特召集有關官商會議。對運銷問題。已商得具體辦法、嗣後當可來源暢通，而各處鑒斤無處匱乏云」，記者又餉及目下食鹽狀態，據答。：「木局站於官方指專管理地位，除協力疎暢來源外，目下所注重之消極工作，為：　嚴格管理另售鹽店，　取締單帮販鹽出境。至計口配給方案，正在研究中，一俟具體決定，卽可呈請財部核准施行」。</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>關於米糧統制委員　會用人問題</h3>
<p>一個機構，無論政府機關，民間團體，以至工商組織喝要求本身事業的克舉，完全賴乎參加人員的專心一志去推進，如果參加人員未能專心推進，其結果。事業必然不會成功的。就以個人而言，如研究學問、研究科學、也必專心一志，孜孜兀兀，才可以連成理想。因此，對於機關團體的用人，我們主張必須專職·不令兼職。</p>
<p>近日正右積極籌　中的米糧統制委員會。對於用人問題，我們前巳屢次本終熱誠直獻意見。第一，絕對專職，不許兼職。第二，採用甄別制度。傳聞該會用人。有偏於兼職趨勞，將調一部分市商會職員兼領。如果所傳不處，竊期期以為不可。該會工作繁重艱鉅，決非兼職人員所可擔當。况市商會為水市唯一商業團體，據常成推測，其範圍以內應辦事務，諒必頭緒粉繁，就是說原右職員本身職務已甚繁重，在客觀上不可能再兼別聯，每人的時問精神有限，勉強　重，結果關此失彼，兩不討好。所以，我們主張用人絕對以專職為主，必要時，僅委員等不辦實際事務酌最兼領。同時，機構組織，應力求補素化，切勿名目繁多，流終官僚機關之　白，而受牽制之弊。</p>
<p>我們推測迸時乘職盛行的原因，一為生活程度過高、本職收入不數，羣謀兼職挹注。一為偏重情面。在「一人有慶兆民相之」的觀念之下，親戚故舊，來者不拒。其實，辦事與感情截然兩事。辦事以事為前提，卽不能兼用情感，不能以公職為私人酬庸之具。因感於米統會之用人問題，兼諭及此。</p>

<p>戰爭業已進入第五年了，歐洲釉心國家，鑒終局警的棘愛，改取守勞。英美以西西里島為根據地、進迫地中海，採取直衝徹丁尼亞，科西嘉。義國本土，多得堪尼斯，克里特，希臘的姿勢，一面並從英國本土出發，　同西歐北歐。右　部戰錢，紅軍奪還卡科夫，然干洛格以後：其目標直指特尼泊爾。這戰綫在今後的六畢期問爲雨季、在冬季戰開始之前，將暫呈　着狀能。德國在西　南部歐洲嚴密守衛，在東　戰盛，德國本年犧牲土地，以消耗紅軍兵力，紅軍的乓士與戰事，受刊很大的損害。在冬季，紅軍的攻勢，將大見削弱。在　戰綫，紅年的主要目的。亦有於打　德軍，至收復土地則倘在其次。因此，戰鬥極為猛烈，紅軍的攻勞，至特尼泊爾將暫告停頓。特以泊爾以四，德軍的守備　為強固，蘇麻　將避免　牡更多的紅軍。蘇聯希望實現英美在西　　陸，德軍如　從　　　抽囘六十師團的兵力，則不能向特尼治爾以西採取攻勢。然而從英美對蘇的關係來看，英美並不為採助蘇聯而問開第二戰綫曉反之，今年冬季即使右第二戰綫出　，那也將在英美視為蘇聯與德軍的力量均　衰弱的時候</p>
<p>德國採取守勢戰略</p>
<p>德國方面的意。　為英美的空　及登陸戰規模雖小，亦不能不親為重火問題，因此、不能不採取完全的守勢。從攻勞　向守勢的全而轉變，完全是數量的問題。在戰爭初　，兵力英武器，不僅在質的方面，即祚量的方面、德軍也　歷倒的優勢。然而，軍山在猛列進攻時，因美國生產力的增加、　方勞力的平衛完全通轉，現在英美燕如合計把來、無論兵力，武器、在　量上　均較德國佔　勢，補救量的不足，除取守勢外，別無他法。</p>
<p>用守勢作戰，給與敵方相常損害之後。等量方中的均衡恢復過來，然後轉取決定的攻勢。提早達情勞老，即為英美所介岡的四歐住戰這次作戰如果失敗，均衡局勞立即恢復過來。如其成功，　　　戰局即將有所決定從這意義上說。現在的確可　是　臨決戰的階段。英美　想此次可很成功，故一　傳歐洲戰　將於來年告終　在這　問曉德　埋首從事新兵器　研究及製造，特別持右重大的意義。德國的兵力，士氣，毫無疫　的徵象。僅用二三個師團，在懷勢不利的西西里？與英美大軍交戰　數星期之久，德軍的戰鬥力，實堪驚嘆。據蘇聯發表，德國軍隊的配置，東部右二百十一個師團、歐洲右九十一個師團（法，比，荷三十五師關，巴爾幹及挪成各八至十師團，故英國二十師團，　餘為波關及東部戰綫預備軍。德國在西歐的軍　，英美對之其為恐懷，因此。四歐在戰亦　待都市轟炸　內部發生動搖之後。</p>
<p>在守勢期中，德國所視為邊危險的聞題，突前次大戰不同，食　問題已　解決，而最應等成者，實是敵方用轟炸及宣傳所進行的神經戰。</p>
<p>歐洲內部堅穩如故</p>
<p>德國的守勞，蘇　的攻勢，如長此機續，則將右發生共產主義運動的危險、而且針對以德國為中心的歐州盟邦及占領地的進通，　日見加可。歐洲　一部分中立國外，均在德國的勢力下、隨着歐洲決戰時期的迫近而愈加明瞭當則的局勢，英美宜等德國取守勢為德國敗北的　夜，這策略難相當右力，俱中盡劉尚未見有為共所乘次，歡洲內部的團結，仍　穩如故。（翔。譯自九月二日東京，母日新聞）</p>

<h3>食糧統制機構的　回顧與前瞻</h3>
<p>米糧　　社，決定於本月二十日解散，問　成立米糧統制委員匯，業已指定實履登氏魚資然備，會於十。學行買次　備委員會，十一日舉行籌備小組會議，新米糧統和機構，已漸次　於日體化。現　新般覽塲期近，各方對於米糧統制前途。莫不深切關心，茲就此項寶際問題。作一檢討與展望。</p>
<p>米糧　營社之缺</p>
<p>糧食部在為統一採銷米糧起。特組織米糧聯營社，並在主要產米區設立各區聯晉社，由各省布端食局及各區採銷辦事處負責督等。表面上統制機構似已完備，然因米所不明大義、唯求社利之故，以致行政機關無法整頓，終於因此缺點而不得不改革加以撤銷。</p>
<p>府與商續會之態度</p>
<p>國的當局　　　相問題，突棉紗棉布問題同樣重視，與商統會幾度勵洽後，決定設立米糧統制委員會，負責推動一切。新機構之性格</p>
<p>新機構之性格</p>
<p>關於新設之米糧統制機構的性格，籌備之初與商統脅各　專業委員會大同小異，其區別之點，專　委員會為商統會之內部機關，米糧統制委員會為外部機關，實際上殆為獨立性質之機關，專業委員會，僅由一業之商人組織，伹米糧統制委員會，地由各界代表構成，為求取得聯絡起見，是以決定中商統會之物資處長担任米糧統制委員會之委員。又為調度採辦米糧資金便制起見，故中儲滬分行之代表，亦決定為該會委員之一。</p>
<p>日　米　亦參加</p>
<p>查商統會之理監事，並無日方經濟界人士參加而米糧統制委員會之委員中，有日方米業代表五人參加，中日雙方對此食糧問題，頗為重視，希望能順利解決。</p>
<p>待氏之工作</p>
<p>聯啓社創立後數個月，備受各界指責，現已決定解散。</p>
<p>以　羅登氏為中心之新機構，各方莫不寄予重大之期望。袁氏本人，亦曾表示。。不論聯營社之過去成績如何，今後必當力十調整　新解決民會問題，以副市民之期望云。（企靑節譯九月十三日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>棉田改種</h3>
<p>豆類雜糧棉花則不然。今年棉花園下種期內陰雨連綿，氣溫低落，益以近年棉價上　　不如食糧，凡棉田之能改種者。多經改種豆類及其的報　，故棉田耕種面積及棉　均較上年减少甚多。蓋今春成熟之各　冬　　物，如小麥　豆菜籽等，於去年冬季下種之後，均久未見雨，　因各　物之抗早力不同與耕種而償增減不一，故其產景與去年比較，或者增加、或者減少，以　小麥因其抗畢力較張，收　尚解良好，北一帶九佳，紅南浙東本亦不惡能敢討期內多雨·成績報差，不過一般　之，</p>
<p>小麥收穫超過去年　　各地小廖耕種而　均右增加、故收穫總量可趙過去年。以　蠶豆因今年　最過多、收成不及去年，惟亦因耕種面積增加，此成　量可典去年　　禺菜籽　為狀最惡。　其下種時既　早　，及成熟之際，復遭風雨，並以耕種面積减少，故收成　量當不及去年。</p>

<h3>故都的虎疫</h3>
<p>防疫空氣彌散</p>
<p>八月過去九月來了，每一個人都在等待着哄動已久的全華北防空演習。九月一日早晨還右臂察按戶調查準備的悄形，同時又訓示應當旅行的事項。然而九月二日的北京中央廣播電台知忽然發出北京防衛司令部的命合說是「北京管區之防空演習，前定九月四日至八日實施五日，然本次為加強防止虎疫計·決定豐合及北京管區之防空演習暫予延期。」於是，防虎的空氣就取防空的空氣而代之迷漫了全北京。</p>
<p>虎疫的由來</p>
<p>虎疫在北京本來不常發生，今年北京久早，早後又加以淫雨。前兩星期屋內的溫度還在一百度之上最近連連續續的下了幾天雨，頓時冷了下來。現在是早晚都得加上毛衣，因為氣候的突變，虎疫也就隨之而來·第一次發現的是在上月二十六日、患者是一個向苑的居民·後來就蔓延到城內，在廣安門·祟文門·東單，朝陽門、西便門，前外大李　帽胡同等牠患病及死亡者竟然右了十幾個。於是、北京當局對此就特別加以注意。上月三十一日起。有幾個重要的城門、如西一致門、朝陽門等開了一半門、　市民出入然而却有日本憲兵隊，啓察隊，治安檢查行人，就是鄕下人趕市靑菜的也非把菜蔬經過消事葉水洗過後不得進城。影響所及·菜蔬的　格日見高漲，而前此。子備着敗消食糧入城的禁令而來的鄉下販糧小商人也不大容易進城，因此糧價也就和菜蔬一樣的高漲。另一方面城內發現虎疫的街道也就斷絕了交通。這兩天患者和死亡的數目又見增加。昨日東四牌樓六條胡同也因為發規虎疫而禁止出入。一直到今天為止。多數的城門還是關着</p>
<p>防疫的措置</p>
<p>至於防止的措置，即除了暫時取消防空演習以外，北京防衛司令部及各關係機關又於本月二日下午三時假北　防備司令部召開防疫會議。出席的有華北政務委員會，市委社會局。衛生局，警察局，日本大使館，華北交通居留民　等代表。據報紙所載，這會議的目的是在於「決定擴大展開防疫工作，以求京士全市民之安）三日不午三時又右圓　的會議·今日實報稱昨日該會的報告說：「現日方業以總領事館，居留民爲中心而編成防疫隊，而有妥善之處置，配北安通公司亦於北京等各站，力行防疫，殊獲成果。同時我方於北京市公署及習察局之强力指導下，已動員巾國醫師會，及北大醫學院。組成汁射班一百班，終五日內、實轉外五區一帶之檢疫，業開始活動、又關於倒斃者之處置間題，亦決於目前暫不經法院之檢騐，而一由衛生局負告處置之各地區決皆旅行戶口檢查，各胡同亦決定令飭淸掃，此外並決督勵乞丐收容所積攝收容市內游動勞工，實施集中檢疫·過有保蘭患者，立即將之隔離，現正由醫察，社會，衛生二局協力進行中·」（九月四日）這樣的積　防疫、大約不久就可以　到極大的效果。然而春天以來而對着餓鬼奮力挣扎的北京市民這囘却非一　抵抗餓鬼一而抵抗瘟神小可了。（八月四日）</p>

<h3>教師宜投筆站崗乎</h3>
<p>其一</p>
<p>教靑之使命，不必用理論來定共重要，無時間，無空間，　都不能與不可忽視其獨佔一席，例之顯者：當友邦處理租界之不久，會鄧重聲明、對於教育事業之盡力保護，與教靑工作人員之大可安心。</p>
<p>伹上海第一區保甲處，（或計不是保甲最高當局的意思。）還是通令教師值日站崗，眞令人大惑不解。</p>
<p>查自警團之工作，在守望相助、而教師之使命，在造就人才，百暫團之站崗僅數小時，而教師之眼務在終身，在高唱尋重教師，救濟教師之今日，竟有令教師値日站崗，　非咄咄怪事，現在一切殷施無不效法東產。不知日本學校，有無規定旬日停課若干時間，以便教師怖日站崗之辦法。，甚望保甲當局，右以體恤教員，則幸甚馬。（彭若谷）</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>本市自舉辦保甲以來，關於盜竊，恐嚇等事，日見減少，足徵保甲之法制情良、當局及各辦事員一之推行努力，宜乎居民皆一銘心刻骨交口繁響。</p>
<p>居民巾，對保甲　　銘感者，尤推教員，以兩年來，保甲當局之文告，對於民警團一再聲明，准許教員免役，良以為教員者，工作煩勞待遇菲薄，生活艱苦，職任重大·保甲當局，洞悉隱情，特免站崗，德至渥也，故為教員者，莫不感激泣下、為學生及學生之家長、亦莫不贊歎無已，「教員免役」保甲當屬之恩德，至優至渥。而聯保長方而，不達此意，往往不准免役，拒絕申請，使當局之思德，不能下流，而下情不能上達，　不知其是何用意也。（寄園）</p>

        <h1>1943.09.15</h1>
<h3>Vitality and Senility</h3>
<p>The ancients had two idioms: "Like the rising sun" and "Reaching the end of the road at dusk." We know that the former describes the radiance and prosperity of the rising sun, which is "vitality." The latter describes the dimness and decline of the setting sun, which is "senility." To be more specific, "vitality" is having firm beliefs, a spirit of actively seeking progress, and the determination to innovate boldly. "Senility" is lacking self-confidence, holding a passive and complacent mentality, and giving up on oneself in every way.</p>
<p>The manifestation of vitality or senility is not only easily discernible in personal attitudes but is also very easily exposed in a nation and a country. If a nation and a country have vitality, their national strength will undoubtedly be strong. This can be verified from the following phenomena:</p>
<p>There must be a close relationship between the government and the people. The government trusts the people, and the people support the government. The government has firm beliefs, a spirit of actively seeking progress, and the determination to innovate boldly. Its measures always stand at the forefront of the people's welfare and faithfully serve the people. With such a vital government, the people will naturally sincerely support and endorse it.</p>
<p>The government always plans for the welfare of the people and the long-term interests of the country. Anything that benefits the country and the people, no matter how big or small, is pursued with all efforts, regardless of difficulties.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of the government, the people abide by laws and regulations, work diligently, and jointly seek the survival of the country, thereby reaching a state of strength and prosperity.</p>
<p>For example, Japan and Germany, whether in terms of the country or the people, both exhibit vigorous vitality. The government plans entirely for the benefit of the people, and the people faithfully accept the government's command, each fulfilling their duties. They move forward in unison towards the path of nation-building.</p>
<p>The same applies to personal life. Those with vitality will undoubtedly have a flourishing and enterprising life, plan and organize their affairs, constantly seek progress, and have a belief in protecting the nation and the country, with rational discernment.</p>
<p>Conversely, if a nation and a country are afflicted with senility, their national strength will undoubtedly decline and fall into chaos. This can also be verified from the following phenomena:</p>
<p>Because the government's measures do not plan for the benefit of the people, or because officials who prioritize private interests occupy important positions in the government. The people hold a hesitant attitude towards the government, and thus, there is a gulf between the two. The government is unwilling to trust the people and cannot give them the opportunity to participate in politics. As a result, the people doubt the government and may even be unable to wholeheartedly support it.</p>
<p>The government's administrative measures lack plans that align with the national conditions. Even if there are plans, they are either lofty and impractical or merely paper plans or verbal plans that are not implemented. Indifference and perfunctoriness result in the inability to guarantee the people's peaceful and prosperous lives, and they will not feel the benefits of having a government, resulting in a very weak concept of the government.</p>
<p>Since the people have no opportunity to participate in politics, their opinions cannot be effectively conveyed. The government is for the government, and the people are for the people. The government has no long-term plans to seek the happiness of the people, and the people are therefore disappointed and dispirited, gradually cultivating selfish and self-serving individualism, and resorting to speculation and opportunism as a means of survival. The more intense this trend becomes, the more depressed the future of the nation and the country will be.</p>
<p>The same applies to the senile individual life. There is no plan for things, and one drifts along, as the saying goes, "Only care about the snow in front of your own door, and not the frost on other people's roofs." They console themselves with the saying "Preserve oneself by being wise." At the same time, they are only interested in profit, engaging in disputes at every turn, and disregard right and wrong. What we have said above is a general explanation of the content and distinction between "vitality" and "senility," as well as their outward manifestations. This is true for nations and countries, and also for individuals.</p>
<p>What is the current state of our Republic of China, its nation, its country, and its individuals? Is it vitality or senility? We hope that the government and the people will all think quietly and deeply reflect. If they feel they belong to the senile, then they must unreservedly and painfully criticize themselves, eradicate senility, and establish vitality.</p>
<p>Regarding the way to eradicate senility and establish vitality, we believe that the government should first actively revitalize itself. If the government is vigorous in everything and full of vitality, there is no need to worry that the people will not be revitalized and lack vitality. If the government has vitality, it must first actively implement several major events, several practical events for the country and the people. Because these major events are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, if the government does not actively implement them first, the people will still maintain a wait-and-see attitude, passively "waiting for opportunities." How to implement several major events? We can list one or two:</p>
<p>Politics is originally a matter of concern to the general public. In principle, it must be open, and the people should be allowed to participate in providing opinions, so as to gather wisdom and benefit everyone, and ensure that measures are appropriate. The prerequisite for the government to allow the people to participate in politics must first be a genuine sincerity in sharing history with the people; merely having the form will still be in vain. "Country first, party second" should be a belief that the ruling party must have. Like the Chongqing regime's "party first, country second," it will inevitably lead to failure in the end.</p>
<p>Only knowing how to be an official but not knowing how to do things is the main reason for the chaos in national affairs in recent decades. Therefore, thoroughly eradicate bureaucratic politics and establish expert politics and clean government. Expedite the strengthening of the personnel system for examinations and appointments.</p>
<p>To achieve a peaceful movement, one must first actively engage in nation-building work. To cooperate in winning the war, one must first actively engage in nation-building work. Because nation-building is the most fundamental work, when the country has strength, the peace movement can be smoothly achieved, and cooperation in the war will have practical results. First, start with increasing agricultural and industrial production. On the one hand, the competent authorities should earnestly implement production increase plans, and on the other hand, do their utmost to eliminate all obstacles to production increase. Secondly, use all efforts to comprehensively suppress prices, especially eliminating artificial causes.</p>
<p>We sincerely call on the government and the people to revitalize the country as one, and for everyone to have a spirit of vitality. It is undeniable that in recent years, the general public has a misconception that "the situation will definitely change," and that all that is needed is to wait, and opportunities will definitely come. However, let us think, since the Greater East Asia War began one year and nine months ago, how has the situation changed? What good opportunities have been obtained by waiting? If we continue to follow the same path of waiting, perhaps prices will rise further, and life will become more difficult. Our opportunities must be met with a proactive spirit of vitality; they can absolutely not be obtained by passively waiting with a senile attitude. What can be obtained by passively waiting is the pain of higher prices and more difficult life. In reality, "the situation in East Asia has already been established, and there will only be development and no changes." The remaining forces of Britain and the United States will definitely not be revived in East Asia. We can only revitalize ourselves, urge the government, support the government, and cooperate with the friendly nation of Japan to strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War, and achieve the true opportunity—"peaceful and prosperous life"!</p>

It is expected that the outcome of the meeting will make a significant contribution to agricultural production in our country.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) In March of this year, the Food Department convened a food production increase conference to ensure the supply of [number] the army in the front and maintain the livelihood of the people in the rear. Resolutions were passed to earnestly implement various plans. It is learned that the Food Department has formulated comprehensive mobilization measures for increasing food production, in order to plan for further progress in the future. The central government and various provinces, cities, counties, districts, townships, villages, and neighborhoods will separately schedule and hold food production promotion conferences.

<p>Executive Yuan Resolves to Allocate Funds for Vaccine Production</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Executive Yuan convened its 178th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th. The following is a summary of the key cases passed: [number] The Yuan deliberated on the matter submitted by Director Lu of the Department of Health, requesting the allocation of funds for materials and labor to manufacture cholera vaccine, including a detailed budget. After a joint review and endorsement by Secretary-General Chen of the Yuan, a decision was requested. Resolved: Approved the proposed 3 million yuan. Regarding the matter of borrowing over 7 million yuan from the Central Bank of China, it was referred to the Ministry of Finance for consultation with the Central Bank of China. [number] The Yuan deliberated on the matter submitted by Minister Gu of the Food Department, regarding the convening of a food production promotion conference, including the meeting dates and personnel list for each level of meeting, as well as a general estimate of temporary expenses. A decision was requested. Resolved: Passed.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since the Incident, epidemic prevention work in various localities has been mainly overseen by the Allied-established epidemic prevention committees. Recently, to respect our country's sovereignty, the Allies decided to first return the epidemic prevention [number] preparation offices in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Wuhu. Next year's epidemic prevention work will be the responsibility of the Department of Health. Adjustments to epidemic prevention institutions in various localities, the training of technical personnel, and the supply of epidemic prevention materials are all under active [number] consideration and planning. Among these, the supply of vaccines is the most important. In the past, it was entirely dependent on the supply from the Red Cross Society, with the military supplementing any shortfall on a temporary basis. Now that the epidemic prevention work is the responsibility of the Department of Health, the source of vaccines must be planned independently. However, during the war, medical supplies are scarce, and even with large sums of money, it is impossible to purchase them. It is necessary to manufacture them ourselves to ensure a regular supply. The Department of Health has decided to utilize the vaccine manufacturing section of the Pasteur Institute in the former concessions to serve as the vaccine manufacturing plant of the Central Epidemic Prevention Office, and engage in vaccine production. At the Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 14th, the funds for vaccine manufacturing and materials were approved. The progress of epidemic prevention work in the future is predicted to have good results.</p>

<h3>Hubei Establishes Comfort Committee to Aid Bombed Civilians; Basic Fund of 500,000 Yuan Planned</h3>
<p>Hankou, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) Because Chongqing and U.S. aircraft indiscriminately bombed the Wuchang urban area, the innocent civilians suffered casualties.

<h3>Chongqing Holds Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee held its ninth plenary meeting on the 13th, and at 4:00 PM, it approved Chiang Kai-shek as the chairman of the Chongqing faction. At the tenth plenary meeting, government members and presidents and vice presidents of the five Yuan were elected. As a result, it was passed that all the presidents and vice presidents of the five Yuan would remain in office, and Chiang Kai-shek would concurrently serve as the president of the Executive Yuan. It was also decided at this meeting to reduce the number of government members by nine, to be assumed by the presidents and vice presidents of the five Yuan. At 7:00 PM, the eleventh plenary meeting continued to be held, presided over by Chiang Kai-shek at the closing ceremony, and after Dai Chuan [number] made a declaration to the assembly, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Declaration on the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Chongqing Broadcasting, at the tenth plenary meeting of the Chongqing Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee, a resolution on a hardline policy towards the Chinese Communist Party was passed and a declaration was issued. It stated briefly: Ordered the Chinese Communist Party to immediately cease all insurrectionary policies and red [number] activities, and abolish the red government, in order to unify the national regime. When Chiang Kai-shek proposed the resolution, he delivered a speech, severely criticizing the measures taken by the Chinese Communist Party, which greatly obstructed the Chongqing faction's war of resistance. He also demanded the dissolution of the CCP's red government and the reorganization of the CCP's army into the national army, etc. The main points are summarized as follows: I believe that the CCP problem is entirely a political problem, so I believe it should still be resolved by political means. No matter how the CCP slanders the Kuomintang, or by whatever means they stir up disputes, we will deal with them with a generous attitude. And I believe that this policy will surely make the CCP succumb to our policies. If CCP members believe in the Three Principles of the People, strictly abide by laws and order [number] and do not hinder the war, then they will still be treated with the attitude of "no blame for the past" as declared at the previous Tenth Plenary Session. However, they should correct their erroneous thinking, abandon the policy of dividing Chinese territory, change their behavior of insulting the Kuomintang army and hindering [number] the war, and fulfill their declarations issued in 1937 and strive to realize the Three Principles of the People. [number] Stop the insurrectionary red government, in order to unify the national regime. [number] Dissolve the Communist army and reorganize it into the National Revolutionary Army, under the command of the Military Affairs Commission. If they guarantee the CCP's loyalty to the "central government," then we will treat them equally.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aircraft Attack Hong Kong and Guangzhou; Repelled by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing sent ten P38 aircraft to attack Guangzhou and Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 12th, but they turned around and fled after being intercepted by Japanese fighter planes.</p>
<h3>Minister of Information, An Account of the Situation, Speaks to Reporters</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) Mr. An Wei, Minister of Information of the Japanese Embassy in China, met with Chinese reporters [number] at 4:00 PM on the 14th, and commented on the surrender of the Italian Badoglio cabinet to Britain and the United States. He pointed out that Badoglio's betrayal was [number] due to weakness of will, which led to him being taken advantage of by British and American conspiracies. We only need to have a firm will and believe that the Greater East Asia War can be completed.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Wewak; Three Shot Down; Fierce Air Battles Over New Guinea Island</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) A dispatch from the Japanese [number] base [number] in the South Pacific reports that the air battles over New Guinea Island have been extremely fierce in recent days.

At 9:00 AM on the 13th, the enemy used over fifty P38, B25, and B24 aircraft to attack the western sky of Wewak and intercepted the enemy aircraft, shooting down a total of three P38s, and the remaining aircraft fled in panic. Two Japanese aircraft did not return from the battle.</p>
<h3>Italian Fascist Government; Rebuilding Movement Soars; Hitler and Mussolini to Meet Soon; Germany Announces Details of Mussolini's Escape</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) It is rumored that Commander Mussolini has already [number] gone to the German [number] to meet with Chancellor Hitler, and will go to the German capital first.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to the Haitong News Agency, it was announced here last night that Mussolini's family has also been rescued by the German army. After escaping danger, Mr. Mussolini met with his family and spoke on the phone with Chancellor Hitler. The emotions of [number] Mr. Mussolini and Mr. Hitler during the call cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) It is rumored that Mussolini's son, Vittorio, has arrived in Germany.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) Regarding Mussolini's rescue, the German Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the evening of the 13th stating that after Commander [number] was captured on July 25, he was transferred to various places, from a small island near Sardinia [number] to the [number] mainland, before being rescued by the German army. The Badoglio regime's surveillance of Mr. Mussolini was extremely strict, and even the location of his whereabouts was very secret. Every two or three days, all means were used to transfer Mr. Mussolini to a barracks on an island or to a warship, and a large number of important troops were mobilized to strictly guard against leaks. However, despite this strict vigilance, the German army finally discovered [number] the final location of the Commander, only three or four days ago. Chancellor Hitler, upon learning of this [number], immediately ordered the [number] Captain of the Guard to overcome all difficulties and rescue Commander Mussolini. Commander Mussolini was only transferred from a small island near Sardinia to the Italian mainland [number] ago, and was detained in a remote mountain area. The surveillance team gradually increased. The German [number] Captain personally led elite German troops and paratroopers and launched a brave raid at dawn on the 12th, bravely breaking into the tiger's den and carrying out a surprise attack, finally rescuing Commander Mussolini. The security team had been ordered to shoot Mr. Mussolini immediately if he was rescued, but this time the German army used lightning-fast tactics, catching the enemy off guard. Mr. Mussolini was rescued without any injuries and flew to a large city on the Italian mainland. After Mr. Mussolini safely arrived at that place, he immediately notified the Chancellor's headquarters by telephone. Then, Mr. Hitler and Mr. Mussolini had their first telephone conversation since the Milan meeting. Looking at this incident, the plot is more bizarre than a novel or biography. Also, Commander Mussolini has met with his family, who had been separated for six weeks and had broken out of imprisonment, but due to mental and physical exhaustion, he fell asleep for several hours after the meeting. The news of Commander Mussolini's rescue spread to Italy, and a "Fascist revival" movement was immediately launched in Italy. Black [number] teams appeared on the streets, and Fascist party flags were flying in various cities. In addition, Fascist party leaders and former cabinet members rescued by the German army also frequently met with Commander Mussolini. Thus, the momentum for rebuilding the Fascist government became even more [number] active. During his imprisonment in recent decades, Commander Mussolini was completely unaware of the recent international situation and the evolution of the world war due to isolation from news.

<h3>Ionian Sea, British Naval Activity, Germany Strengthens Defenses in the Balkans</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch, a British news agency reported last night: A portion of the British Navy under the command of Admiral Cunningham appears to be preparing for operations in the Ionian Sea. Simultaneously, Allied air forces are concentrating between Brindisi, Otranto, and Bari, preparing to attack the Balkans.

<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - German military authorities telegraphed: German forces have completely controlled the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea and have occupied the Pola naval base. The coastline from Mantua to Genoa has also been occupied by German forces. German forces, eliminating Italian resistance, reoccupied Fort Bernal on the night of September 11th.</p>
<p>Italian Army Disarmament Proceeds Smoothly</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - When German forces disarmed the Italian troops stationed in northern Greece, the Italian commander, because of his opposition to Badoglio's rebellious actions, surrendered to the German forces and ensured the smooth execution of German orders. Most of the Italian troops in the Corinth area continued to fight alongside the Germans. On the Peloponnese, the disarmament of Italian troops proceeded without incident. Several Fascist Blackshirt troops and Italian army soldiers declared their continued loyalty to the German-Italian alliance. In Montenegro, German forces continued to advance towards the coast. Many Blackshirt divisions joined German units. German forces captured seven cargo ships that had been scuttled to block the harbor, and the harbor was occupied by German forces. Italian naval vessels and merchant ships in the Port of Piraeus were seized by German forces on September 9th. Sailors from Italian torpedo boats volunteered to join the German forces. Several thousand Italian sailors in Athens and Piraeus have declared their willingness to continue fighting alongside the German forces.

The people of Tirana lined the streets to welcome them, expressing their willingness to cooperate with the German forces.</p>
<h3>Badoglio Regime Surrenders, Japanese Government Takes Measures, Italian Troops in East Asia Disarmed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 14th: Because the Italian "Badoglio" government betrayed the alliance and surrendered on September 9th, the Imperial Army and Navy will immediately disarm Italian troops in various parts of East Asia and impound their ships. Italian rights in the occupied territories will be taken over by the Imperial Army and Navy. In other regions, the Allies will cooperate in the takeover. Non-combatant Italians in the occupied territories will be placed under surveillance and protection.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government considers the surrender of the Badoglio regime to be an act of hostility towards Japan. It issued a statement on the afternoon of the 9th, clarifying the Japanese government's attitude. Meanwhile, the government has decided to take necessary measures quickly, based on established policies, regarding Italians residing in Japan and their assets. It has decided to detain and monitor Italian diplomatic officials stationed in Japan and ordinary Italian expatriates, cutting off their communication with the outside world. Appropriate measures have been taken to stop cargo shipments. In terms of financial relations, foreign exchange transactions related to Italians have also been suspended.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Forces in Central Italy Withdraw from Salerno, Bari Occupied by British Forces</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - It is claimed here that British forces are crowding onto various types of ships, withdrawing from the Salerno area and retreating to Policastro harbor, located in the southeastern part of the western coast of Italy. These ships arrived before dawn this morning in Policastro harbor. They are the first ships by which the British army are attempting to retreat southeast of Salerno. Initially, they took a direct route to Sicily, but after being attacked by German aircraft en route, they changed course and sailed south along the rocky coast. Yesterday afternoon, British forces were seen boarding ships in many places in Salerno and the Gulf of Policastro. Southeast of Salerno, the British have a total of two battleships, several cruisers, and fifty to sixty medium and large transport ships, as well as multiple landing craft, engaged in evacuating the remnants of the defeated landing force. North of the Gulf of Policastro, there are five large landing craft and about thirty to forty landing boats. These landing boats are used to transport completely exhausted British heavy troops who have fled from the mountains. This disorganized retreat, occurring shortly after the landing, proves that it has encountered a large-scale defeat.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters, Eisenhower, the Allied commander in Algiers, announced today that the anti-Axis forces have occupied Bari. Bari is located on the Adriatic coast of Italy, about sixty miles northwest of Brindisi, which has already been occupied by the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<h3>Forty-Seven Italian Warships Join Anti-Axis</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Central News Agency) - After the unconditional surrender of the Badoglio regime, the total number of Italian warships that were able to escape from Italian ports is not yet known. However, according to currently available information, a total of four battleships, nine cruisers, seventeen destroyers, two aircraft carriers, fourteen submarines, and one smaller warship have fled to anti-Axis bases. According to a United Press report from Larrini, two cruisers, three destroyers, and two aircraft carriers have already arrived at Gibraltar. Algiers Radio also broadcast on September 12th that another fourteen submarines and eight destroyers were en route to Malta, and one smaller ship had arrived in Cyprus. Admiral Cunningham, the Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Naval Forces in the Mediterranean, announced on September 12th that there were five Italian battleships, not four, anchored in Malta. At the same time, Reuters' naval correspondent said that Italy's elite battleships cannot be used against Japan. These battleships cannot be sent to the East by their original crews, as there is no such obligation under the armistice agreement. Due to technical reasons, they cannot be operated by anti-Axis crews. Moreover, the Italian fleet was built specifically for high-speed operations in the Mediterranean, and its fuel capacity is insufficient for operations in the vast Pacific Ocean. More than half of the 1,500 crew members of the new Italian battleships are highly trained technicians, and the technical equipment of Italian ships is different from that of the British and American navies, so the British and Americans cannot train personnel to operate Italian ships without considerable delay.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy to Italy Cables Safety</h3>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues on Central and Southern Routes of the Eastern Front, German Forces Withdraw from Bryansk</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - Colonel Hammer, a military correspondent for the German News Agency, stated that German forces withdrew from the city of Bryansk last night, after thoroughly destroying all factories and military facilities in the city. Goods and machinery were moved from the city to other locations two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - German military authorities issued the following report on the Eastern Front on the 13th: Since the Soviet offensive began, it has been ten days. Now, in the southern sector, a large-scale offensive has begun with elite troops. This offensive may continue until the rainy, muddy season. German units in various locations have become aware of this Soviet attempt and are preparing countermeasures. No matter how stubbornly the Soviet forces attack, they will be repelled. In the Donets River area, several units have cut off the rear of the Soviet forces that have broken into the German lines, causing them to lose contact one after another and become encircled. Fierce fighting is currently underway in that area. Detailed information is not yet available. The front lines west of Kharkov and near Konotop are also at a stalemate. On the 12th, German forces in the southern sector destroyed 83 Soviet tanks. West of Vyazma, German forces are also fiercely resisting the Soviet forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - The correspondent of the German News Agency, Selrius, said: The pressure exerted by the Soviet forces on the central and southern routes of the Eastern Front will remain very strong until the weekend. It is expected that the Soviets will continue to attack until the autumn muddy season begins. However, generally speaking, the situation on the Eastern Front has slightly eased, probably because the German forces are fighting back vigorously and have been able to encircle and cut off the enemy's vanguard. Especially in the area between the Sea of Azov and the middle reaches of the Donets River, as well as west and south of Kharkov, the German armored units have been very successful. The enemy's attacks towards Poltava and Krasnograd have made no progress. The German forces in this blocking line are gradually completing the task of blocking westward, and the scope of the front line is gradually shrinking. The fighting west of Konotop is fluid and mobile, with intertwined front lines, which have yet to be determined. At the same time, the Soviet forces are attacking Bryansk and intensifying pressure west of Kirov on the upper reaches of the Desna River. The situation in the Smolensk region remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: On Sunday, Soviet forces achieved some success on the right flank of the German Desna line. Soviet forces, with strong troops and under the cover of heavy artillery fire, crossed the Desna River and established a bridgehead on the west bank of the river. However, it is reported that German units, which initially evaded the fierce Soviet attacks, finally prevented the Soviet forces from expanding their initial success. German reserve troops, which arrived at the breakthrough point in the late afternoon, finally recovered a place that had been taken by the enemy and reduced its bridgehead. Other Soviet attempts to cross the river were thwarted, and the Red Army suffered many casualties.</p>
<h3>Security Restored in Rome</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German occupation authorities in Rome announced by broadcast on the night of the 13th that German forces have now assumed responsibility for the defense of major areas of Italy. Because unruly elements resisted German forces, some fighting occurred in the city of Rome. However, security in Rome has now been restored. All weapons held by Italian citizens must be handed over to the authorities. Anyone still holding weapons after September 15th will be sentenced to death. Those who violate other military control regulations will be severely punished by military law.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Expressions of Support for the Leader</p>
<p>Zurich, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a cable from Curacao, when the news of Mussolini's rescue reached Rome, German forces immediately broadcast to all residents of Rome with sound trucks equipped with loudspeakers.

When this news reached Corendolyn and other places, it was almost midnight, but it immediately spread throughout the city. Fascist Italian soldiers also staged temporary parades and demonstrations.</p>
<p>Zurich, 14th (Central News Agency) - It is reported that in various cities in northern Italy, Fascist party rule is gradually being restored. Since the 11th, Blackshirt party members have been staging demonstrations in the streets, despite the imposition of martial law.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Rationed Rice Still Urgently Needs Relief, It Is Reported That Some Difficulties Have Been Resolved, City Food Bureau Borrows 30 Million Yuan from Central Reserve Bank</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food's second allocation of 150,000 bags of rice to our city, of which 100,000 bags designated to be allocated from the Su-Song-Chang-Jia area, could not be shipped as scheduled due to issues with the payment procedures. According to Shanghai News Agency reporters, some accidental difficulties have now been resolved. The Rice Grain Joint Venture will send personnel to the dispatch area to transport the rice to Shanghai to meet the needs of the people.</p>
<p>Issues of Transportation Responsibility and Payment Priority</p>
<p>It is found that the Ministry of Food allocated 150,000 bags of rice, belonging to the quota of August, including 100,000 bags from the Su-Song-Chang-Jia area, 30,000 bags from the Nanjing area, and 20,000 bags from the Yangzhou area. Except for the 100,000 bags from Su-Song-Chang-Jia designated to be transported by the Rice Grain Joint Venture, the 50,000 bags from the Yangzhou and Nanjing areas, together with the 11,790 bags of the first batch from the Huzhou area that have not been transported, a total of over 68,000 bags are to be transported separately by the Single United Rice Shell Allocation Association and the Rice Grain Joint Venture.</p>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reporters learned that the Ministry of Food has always adhered to the principle of paying before shipping for the allocation of rice to local areas. The first batch allocated to Shanghai was temporarily permitted to be shipped before payment after Mayor Chen's consultation. As for the second batch of rice, the established principle was followed, but the shipping period was delayed due to the difficulty in raising funds. Now, all kinds of difficulties have been resolved. According to another source, the relevant authorities in the city are giving serious consideration to the requirement of raising funds and paying in full before shipping the rice. Finally, the district authorities borrowed heavily from the bank to facilitate turnover. Therefore, the transportation of the second batch of rice can begin within days.</p>
<p>The Issue of the Existence or Abolition of the Joint Venture, the View of the Grain Control Committee</p>
<p>The issue of the Rice Grain Joint Venture has attracted attention from various parties since the Grain Control Committee began to store rice. However, the nature, powers, and work of the Rice Control Committee after its establishment are not yet fully determined. Therefore, whether the Joint Venture should be managed and retained is awaiting the decision of the Ministry of Food.</p>
<p>The Rice Grain Control Committee held a preliminary meeting on the 11th of this month, the first preparatory meeting on the 12th, and held a discussion meeting and a second preparatory meeting on the 13th. The agenda of the three-day meeting focused on the unified purchase of rice shells in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. After ten people from both China and Japan participated in the meeting, it was considered that the starting point should be from procurement and transportation. The Chinese authorities must do their utmost to fulfill their responsibilities, and the Allied side should thoroughly assist. According to Shanghai News Agency reporters, the committee has reported the results of the Japan-China meeting to the relevant senior authorities and requested instructions. It will convene another meeting within days to discuss preparatory work.</p>
<p>The Loan Process of the Food Bureau</p>
<p>The City Food Bureau established a huge loan of 30 million yuan with the City Public Liaison and the Central Reserve Bank. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter paid a special visit to Zhang Xianzhi, the director of the bureau, to inquire about the purpose and process of the loan. He was told the following: "Our bureau was established in January last year and only received an initial operating fund of 120,000 yuan. There was no rice procurement fund because the rice needed at that time was first allocated by the Grain Management Committee for public sales before repayment. Moreover, because a portion of the private rice in storage could be effectively utilized, a large amount of funds was not required. Later, the method of releasing rice was changed, requiring payment in advance. Our bureau needed to prepare a huge amount of funds to facilitate turnover, so we borrowed from the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank. The first loan amounted to 8 million yuan, which was approved by the former Director Wu and submitted to the City Government on November 17 last year. In early February of this year, I succeeded as the director of this bureau. Because the amount of rice and the price of rice increased each period, more funds were required. I submitted a request to the City Government and borrowed an additional 6 million yuan on March 1, and another 4 million yuan on May 1. In total, we borrowed 18 million yuan three times, which allowed us to hold public sales on schedule. Until after early August, the demand for rice increased, and the original funds became more difficult to manage. Therefore, the City Government repaid all the previously accumulated 18 million yuan and established a new reserve of 30 million yuan with the Central Reserve Bank on August 19. This is the process of our bureau borrowing from the Central Reserve Bank. Regarding the use of the loan, such as the receipt and payment of funds and the entry and exit accounts of grain, the bank has assigned a special commissioner stationed in the bureau who knows it very well. In addition, various statistical tables are filled out and sent to the bank every ten days for reference. Although there has been a slight delay in the recent public sales, with the assistance of the Central Reserve Bank in borrowing funds, we should be able to handle it comfortably. We have already established separate methods for receiving and paying funds at each public sales point, which will be implemented from the 23rd period onwards, to make turnover more flexible and reduce the amount of frozen funds such as burlap guarantee deposits. We will try to ensure that there are no more delays to meet the expectations of the people."</p>

<h3>Salt Administration Decides on Salt Supply Methods: Water and Land Transportation to Ensure Unimpeded Sources, Sales Still Under Yuhua Company Supervision</h3>
<p>The Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance is deeply concerned about the people's need for edible salt. Recognizing that the supply of goods in Shanghai is currently scarce due to transportation issues, and that some ignorant merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate and raise market prices without authorization, which harms people's livelihoods, it is necessary to improve the production, transportation, and sales of edible salt. Therefore, a meeting was convened in the Nanjing office, gathering relevant agencies and companies to discuss improvement measures. Those present included Director Ruan, Deputy Director Liu, Secretary, Section Chief Gong, Director Liu of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Salt Tax Bureau, Deputy Director Kato, Director Chen and Section Chief Xue of the Songjiang Salt Affairs Administration Bureau, Deputy Director Waigan of the Haizhou District Salt Affairs Administration Bureau, Directors Yang and Luo of the China Salt Industry Company, Director Morita, Section Chief Ota, Director Dan of the Yuhua Salt Industry Company, Section Chief Chen, and Advisor Ouchi.</p>
<p>Meeting Result: First,</p>
<p>Director Ruan (Deputy Director acting) reported the purpose of the meeting, and then immediately began discussion on: How to improve transportation and ensure unimpeded sources: (Resolution) In the future, in addition to the original ships and sailboats, railway transportation will be implemented, and the tonnage of shipping will be increased. Thus, with both water and land transportation, the source can be unblocked. The China authorities immediately expressed their willingness to take responsibility for handling this matter. Regarding how to improve the salt sales issue: (Resolution) The salt sales issue will still be the responsibility of the Yuhua Company. After the China Company transports the salt, it will quickly distribute it to salt merchants in various districts for widespread sale. The Yuhua Company expressed its willingness to do its utmost to find the quickest way to distribute the salt. Finally, the Director discussed with the various Directors, etc., that they should strive to supervise and guide the local salt affairs and must not be negligent.</p>
<p>Explaining the Current Situation: Moreover, regarding the salt problem in this city, a reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit yesterday to the person in charge of the Songjiang District Salt Affairs Administration Bureau. According to reports: "The supply of edible salt is scarce due to unimpeded transportation, and illegal private dealers are engaged in illegal transactions, resulting in a black market phenomenon, which is regrettable. The Ministry of Finance is paying close attention to this matter and has convened a meeting of relevant officials and businessmen. Concrete measures have been discussed for the transportation and sales problems. Afterwards, the source can be unblocked, and there will be no shortage of salt in various places." The reporter also asked about the current state of edible salt, and the reply was: "This bureau is in an official position to manage and control, in addition to helping to unblock the source, the passive work that is currently focused on is: Strictly manage retail salt shops, and ban single-person salt vendors from leaving the country. As for the plan for rationing based on population, it is under study, and as soon as a concrete decision is made, it can be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation."</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>On the Personnel Issues of the Rice and Grain Control Committee</h3>
<p>For any organization, whether it be a government agency, a non-governmental organization, or a commercial or industrial association, the success of its endeavors depends entirely on the dedication and focus of its members to drive progress. If the members are unable to devote themselves wholeheartedly, the organization's efforts will inevitably fail. Similarly, individuals who pursue academic research or scientific inquiry must be single-minded and diligently focused to achieve their goals. Therefore, we advocate that personnel within organizations and groups must be employed in dedicated, full-time positions and not permitted to hold concurrent posts.</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Control Committee, currently in the midst of active preparations, presents a case in point. Regarding personnel matters, we have repeatedly offered our sincere and straightforward opinions. First, positions must be absolutely full-time, with no concurrent appointments allowed. Second, a rigorous selection process should be adopted. Rumors suggest that the committee is inclined towards part-time appointments, with plans to transfer some staff from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to hold concurrent positions. If these rumors prove true, we believe this is ill-advised. The committee's work is burdensome and challenging, far beyond the capacity of part-time staff. Furthermore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the sole commercial body in the city, and we can reasonably assume that its range of responsibilities is extensive and complex. This means that existing staff already have heavy workloads, making it objectively impossible for them to take on additional duties. Each person has limited time and energy, and attempting to juggle multiple roles will lead to both tasks suffering. Therefore, we insist that full-time positions be the norm, with only committee members and others who do not handle practical matters being considered for part-time appointments. At the same time, the organizational structure should be streamlined and simplified, avoiding excessive bureaucracy and the pitfalls of a bloated governmental apparatus.</p>
<p>We believe that the current trend of concurrent appointments stems from two primary causes: first, the high cost of living makes it difficult to subsist on a single income, leading people to seek additional employment; and second, an excessive emphasis on personal connections. The notion of "one person's celebration extends to the entire nation" leads to the acceptance of any and all relatives and friends, regardless of their qualifications. However, official duties and personal feelings are two separate matters. Official duties must be guided by principles, not influenced by emotions, and public office should not be used as a tool for private reward. These thoughts on the Rice and Grain Control Committee's personnel issues lead us to these broader observations.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Combat Strength: Germany's Defensive Counter-Offensive</h3>
<p>The war has now entered its fifth year. European Axis powers, aware of the precariousness of the final outcome, have adopted a defensive posture. Using Sicily as a base, the Anglo-Americans are pressing into the Mediterranean, taking a direct course toward Italy and Corsica. Italy itself is adopting a posture reminiscent of Cannes, Crete, and Greece. Simultaneously, from the British mainland, they are threatening Western and Northern Europe. On the Eastern Front, the Red Army recaptured Kharkov. After Rylsk, their target is directly aimed at the Dnieper River. This battle line will likely remain static in the coming six weeks during the rainy season, before the start of the winter campaign. Germany is closely defending Western and Southern Europe. On the Eastern Front, Germany has sacrificed land this year to deplete the Red Army's strength. The Red Army's soldiers and war efforts have suffered significant damage. During the winter, the Red Army's offensive will be greatly weakened. On the Eastern Front, the Red Army's primary objective is to weaken the German forces, with reclaiming territory as a secondary goal. As such, the fighting is extremely fierce, and the Red Army's offensive will temporarily halt at the Dnieper River. Beyond the Dnieper River, the German defenses are very strong, and the Soviets will avoid sacrificing more Red Army soldiers. The Soviet Union hopes for an Anglo-American landing in Western Europe. If Germany is forced to withdraw sixty divisions from the Eastern Front, it will be unable to launch an offensive west of the Dnieper. However, judging from the Anglo-American relationship with the Soviet Union, the Anglo-Americans are not opening a second front to assist the Soviet Union. On the contrary, even if a second front emerges this winter, it will likely only happen when the Anglo-Americans perceive that both the Soviet and German forces are weakening.</p>
<p>Germany Adopts a Defensive Strategy</p>
<p>Germany's intention is that, while the Anglo-American air raids and landing operations are small in scale, they cannot be ignored as a significant problem. Therefore, Germany cannot help but adopt a completely defensive posture. The complete shift from an offensive to a defensive posture is entirely a matter of quantity. At the beginning of the war, German forces held overwhelming superiority in both the quality and quantity of soldiers and weapons. However, as the war progressed and American production capacity increased, the balance of power completely shifted. Now, taken together, the Anglo-American forces possess a quantitative advantage over Germany in both soldiers and weapons. To compensate for this quantitative disadvantage, Germany has no choice but to adopt a defensive posture.</p>
<p>The plan is to inflict considerable damage on the enemy through defensive warfare and then, once the balance of power is restored, launch a decisive offensive. An early landing would be a major gamble for the Anglo-Americans. If this operation fails, the balance of power will immediately be restored. But if it succeeds, the war will be decided. In this sense, the current situation is indeed at a decisive stage. The Anglo-Americans hope for a very successful outcome, hence the constant rumors that the European war will end next year. During this period, Germany is focusing on the research and manufacture of new weapons, which is of particular significance. Germany's troop strength and morale show no signs of weakness. Germany fought the Anglo-American forces in Sicily for several weeks with only two or three divisions under unfavorable conditions. The fighting capacity of the German army is truly astonishing. According to Soviet reports, the deployment of German troops is as follows: 211 divisions in the East, 91 divisions in Europe (35 in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, 8 to 10 in the Balkans and Norway, 20 in Britain, and the remainder as reserves on the Polish and Eastern Fronts). The Anglo-Americans are terrified of the German military presence in Western Europe. Therefore, the attack on Europe is waiting until urban bombings and internal unrest weaken Germany.</p>
<p>During the defensive period, the most dangerous issues for Germany are not the food problems that plagued them in the previous war, which have been resolved, but rather the psychological warfare waged by the enemy through bombing and propaganda.</p>
<p>Europe's Interior Remains Stable</p>
<p>If Germany's defense and the Soviet Union's offensive continue in this manner, there is a risk of communist movements emerging. Moreover, the encroachment on Germany's allied and occupied territories in Europe will become increasingly apparent. With the exception of some neutral countries, the rest of Europe is under German influence. As the decisive period in Europe approaches, the situation becomes clearer. The Anglo-Americans believe that Germany's adoption of a defensive posture is a sign of defeat. This strategy is somewhat effective, but so far there have been no instances of communist exploitation. The unity of Europe's interior remains stable. (Xiang Yi, translated from the Tokyo Mother Daily News, September 2nd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Police Authorities' Statement Denies Confiscation of Pedestrians' Gold Jewelry, Current Investigation of Source of Rumors</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Since the 6th of this month, rumors suddenly broke out in Shanghai that the Japanese military police were confiscating metal products such as gold rings and gold jewelry from pedestrians in the area of Nanjing Road, North Sichuan Road Bridge, and Zha Pu Road Bridge. For a time, the rumors spread widely, and the general public was skeptical. The Japanese military police authorities issued a statement on the 14th, absolutely denying these facts and urging that in the future, if such behavior is actually encountered, it should be immediately reported to the military police so that they can assist in arresting the perpetrators. The transcript of the military police authorities' statement is as follows: The Japanese Army and Navy have always worked hard to stabilize people's livelihoods. Recently, rumors have suddenly arisen that the military police are confiscating metal products from women passing by. This is truly regrettable. The Japanese authorities have never implemented any regulations secretly without prior announcement. This will continue to be the case in the future. If you actually encounter confiscation in the future, please immediately notify the nearest military police station. Also, the military police are now strictly investigating the source of these rumors. Temporarily by the Education Bureau</p>

<h3>Retrospect and Prospect of the Food Control Organization</h3>
<p>The Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company has decided to dissolve on the 20th of this month, and the Rice and Grain Control Committee will be established. It has already been decided that Mr. Yuan Lüedeng will be responsible. The committee will meet on the 10th. The preparatory committee held a preparatory group meeting on the 11th. The new rice and grain coordination mechanism is gradually becoming a reality. Now that the establishment of the new council is approaching, all parties are deeply concerned about the future of rice and grain control. This article will examine and prospect on this specific problem.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company</p>
<p>In order to unify the purchase and sale of rice and grain, the Food Department specially organized the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company, and established joint promotion companies in the main rice producing areas, which were supervised by the food bureaus of each province and the purchase and sale offices of each region. On the surface, the control mechanism seems to be complete, but because rice merchants do not understand the big picture and only seek company profits, administrative agencies cannot be rectified, and this shortcoming has led to the need to reform and abolish the company.</p>
<p>The Attitudes of the Government and the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The national authorities attach as much importance to the rice and grain problem as they do to the cotton yarn and cotton cloth problem. After several discussions with the Chamber of Commerce, it was decided to establish the Rice and Grain Control Committee to be responsible for promoting everything. The characteristics of the new organization</p>
<p>The characteristics of the new organization</p>
<p>Regarding the characteristics of the newly established rice and grain control mechanism, it is very similar to the professional committees of the Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of the preparation, and the difference is that the professional committee is an internal agency of the Chamber of Commerce, while the rice and grain control committee is an external agency, and in fact it is an independent agency. The professional committee is only organized by merchants of one industry, but the rice and grain control committee is composed of representatives from all walks of life. In order to achieve liaison, it was decided that the Director of the Materials Department of the China Chamber of Commerce would serve as a member of the Rice and Grain Control Committee. In order to facilitate the allocation of funds for purchasing rice and grain, it was also decided that the representative of the Shanghai branch of the China Reserve Bank would also be one of the members of the committee.</p>
<p>Japanese rice merchants also participate</p>
<p>It was found that no Japanese economic figures participated in the directors and supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce, but five Japanese rice industry representatives participated in the members of the Rice and Grain Control Committee. Both China and Japan attach great importance to the food problem and hope to solve it smoothly.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan's Work</p>
<p>The Joint Venture Company has been criticized by all parties for several months after its establishment and has now decided to dissolve.</p>
<p>All parties have high expectations for the new organization centered on Mr. Yuan Lüedeng. Mr. Yuan himself also said that no matter how the past performance of the Joint Venture Company was, he will definitely strive to adjust and solve the people's livelihood problems in the future, in order to live up to the expectations of the citizens.

<h3>Change Cotton Fields to Other Crops</h3>
<p>It is not possible for beans and miscellaneous grains, but it is for cotton. This year, during the planting period for cotton, it rained continuously and the temperature was low. In addition, cotton prices have risen in recent years and cotton production is not as good as food crops. All cotton fields that could be converted to other crops have been converted to beans and their reports, so the cultivated area of cotton fields and the amount of cotton have decreased significantly compared with last year. Because the various winter crops that matured this spring, such as wheat, broad beans, rapeseed, etc., had not seen rain for a long time after being sown last winter, and because the drought resistance of various crops was different and the increase or decrease in cultivated land was different, their production prospects were either increased or decreased compared with last year. Wheat, because of its strong drought resistance, still has good harvests. Jiujia in the north, Hongnan and Zhejiang East are also not bad. It is also said that there was more rain during the peak season, so the results were poor, but in general,</p>
<p>The wheat harvest exceeded last year. The area cultivated with wheat increased in various places, so the total harvest volume may exceed last year. Because there was too much drought this year, the broad bean harvest was not as good as last year, but because the cultivated area also increased, the harvest volume may also be comparable to last year. The rapeseed situation was the worst. It was droughty when it was sown, and it was subjected to wind and rain when it matured. In addition, the cultivated area was reduced, so the harvest volume should not be as good as last year.</p>
<h3>Settlement of Accounts for the Mid-Autumn Festival - Industries Pass Peacefully, Overall Finance is Very Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival for the settlement of accounts for various industries. The banking industry, various money shops, and various industry markets were all closed as usual. Various companies, factories, and shops were very busy handling the settlement of accounts for the Mid-Autumn Festival. Most of the credit accounts that had been released before were able to be recovered before the festival. At the same time, because the Central Reserve Bank, the Silver Money Reserve Association, and the financial industry cooperated effectively, the overall finance was very stable, and the money market was not as tight as in the past. Various industries have passed this Mid-Autumn Festival peacefully. It is also reported that various banks and various industry markets will resume business today, and all documents during the holidays will be processed after the resumption of business.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Agricultural Production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces This Year - Survey Report by the Economic Research Association</h3>
<p>The Chinese Economic Research Association, in order to investigate the general situation of development in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, entrusted local churches to conduct the survey.</p>
<p>High Rice Prices</p>
<p>Increased Rice Fields It is reported that the area sown with rice in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year has generally increased due to the stimulus of high rice prices. As for the weather, there was sufficient rainfall this spring, making planting easier. At this time of high labor costs, farmers have benefited greatly. Generally speaking, the initial growth of rice in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year has been quite good. Only the areas on both sides of the Yangtze River and the eastern part of Zhejiang have been slightly worse due to the slightly cold weather and lack of sunshine, but there is no major problem.</p>
<h3>Xing Zhuang Company Increases Capital; Deadline for Completion</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance has revised the articles of incorporation for banks, the Savings Bank Law, the Provisional Regulations for Trust Companies, and the regulations for provincial and municipal banks. Financial institutions such as banks, money shops, and trust companies must increase their capital to comply with national laws. It was learned yesterday that the deadline for completing the capital increase of various money shops is before the 31st of December this year. Those that exceed the deadline will be ordered to suspend operations. Furthermore, the business operations of all financial institutions are strictly limited to those stipulated by law. Those who deviate will be subject to penalties by the Financial Affairs Inspection Office.</p>
<h3>Handicraft Weaving Industry Pleads for Relief</h3>
<p>The Water City Cloth Factory Trade Association has more than 280 members in its handicraft weaving group. Since the unified purchase of yarn and cloth, about ninety percent of the looms have stopped, cutting off their livelihoods. The association has sent a letter to the Cotton Products United Association and the National Commercial Control General Association seeking relief. The New Control Association has replied, stating that it approved letter No. 151 from the Cotton Products United Association, which stated that the handicraft weaving group of the factory trade association mostly has meager capital, and the handwoven cloth must be sold daily to make a living. Now, due to the unified control of yarn and cloth, they cannot move or operate, which affects the livelihoods of the weaving machine households, and requests consideration for relief. The association has verified that the situation described is true and proper. It will wait until the government's yarn and cloth allocation plan is approved and promulgated before the association applies for early relief for review and handling. It is now heard that handwoven cloth is not subject to unified control, and the business scope meets the standards stipulated by the authorities. Yesterday, the association again sent a list of factory addresses to the Commercial Control Association, stating their difficult situation and requesting consideration for the households, investigating the actual situation, and lifting the control of this part of the handicraft cloth industry as soon as possible to maintain production and seek relief.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Convenes Talks with Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Xu Tianshen, Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, convened talks with the responsible persons of various industrial and commercial trade associations at the Municipal Government Auditorium to understand the recent situation of the associations. More than 120 representatives from various associations attended. Director Xu gave a speech, urging the representatives to persuade their fellow traders to join the associations to strengthen their organization and assist the government in implementing wartime economic policies. The representatives expressed their opinions, and the talks lasted for more than an hour before adjourning.</p>

<h3>Plague in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>A Pandemic Atmosphere Pervades</p>
<p>August has passed, and September has arrived. Everyone is waiting for the long-awaited civil defense exercise in all of North China. On the morning of September 1st, there were still traces of household surveys in preparation, and instructions were given on the matters that should be traveled. However, on September 2nd, the Beijing Central Radio Station suddenly issued an order from the Beijing Defense Command stating, "The civil defense exercise in the Beijing area, previously scheduled to be implemented for five days from September 4th to 8th, has been decided to strengthen the prevention of plague. The civil defense exercise in Fengtai and the Beijing area is temporarily postponed." As a result, the atmosphere of preventing plague replaced the atmosphere of civil defense and pervaded all of Beijing.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Plague</p>
<p>The plague rarely occurs in Beijing. This year, Beijing experienced a prolonged drought, followed by continuous rain. Two weeks ago, the temperature indoors was still above 100 degrees. Recently, it has rained continuously for several days, and the weather has suddenly turned cold. Now, it is necessary to wear a sweater in the morning and evening. Due to the sudden change in climate, the plague has also followed. The first case was discovered on the 26th of last month. The patient was a resident of Xiangyuan. Later, it spread to the city. In Guang'anmen, Chongwenmen, Dongdan, Chaoyangmen, Xibianmen, and Dawaili Mao Hutong, there were more than a dozen cases of illness and death. Therefore, the Beijing authorities paid special attention to this. Since the 31st of last month, some important city gates, such as Xizhimen and Chaoyangmen, have only been opened halfway. Although citizens can enter and exit, there are Japanese military police, inspectors, and security personnel checking pedestrians. Even farmers bringing vegetables to the market must have their vegetables washed with disinfectant water before entering the city. As a result, the price of vegetables has risen daily. In addition, small grain merchants from the countryside who came to the city with provisions due to the previous ban on disinfectant food entering the city also found it difficult to enter the city. Therefore, the price of grain has also risen as high as vegetables. On the other hand, the streets in the city where the plague was discovered have also been cut off from traffic. The number of patients and deaths has increased again in the past two days. Yesterday, Liutiao Hutong in Dongsi Pailou was also closed to traffic due to the plague outbreak. Until today, most of the city gates are still closed.</p>
<p>Preventive Measures</p>
<p>As for preventive measures, in addition to temporarily canceling the civil defense exercise, the Beijing Defense Command and other relevant agencies also convened a plague prevention meeting at the North [unclear character] Defense Command at 3:00 PM on the 2nd of this month. Representatives from the North China Political Affairs Commission, the Municipal Committee Social Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Japanese Embassy, and the North China Transportation Residents [unclear character] attended. According to the newspapers, the purpose of this meeting was to "decide to expand the plague prevention work in order to seek the safety of all citizens of Kyoto." Another meeting was held at [unclear character] at 3:00 PM on the 3rd. Today's report stated that yesterday's report said: "Currently, the Japanese side has formed a plague prevention team centered on the Consulate General and residents, and has taken proper measures. The Peian Transport Company is also vigorously carrying out plague prevention at various stations in Beijing, etc., and has achieved significant results. At the same time, under the strong guidance of the Beijing Municipal Government and the [unclear character] Police Bureau, we have mobilized the Chinese Physicians Association and the Peking University Medical College to form 100 injection teams, which will carry out quarantine in the outer five districts within five days and have already begun their activities. In addition, the issue of disposing of those who have fallen ill has also been resolved. For the time being, there will be no examination by the court, and the Health Bureau will be responsible for handling it. All regions have decided to conduct household inspections, and all hutongs have also decided to be ordered to clean up. In addition, it has been decided to urge the beggar shelters to actively accommodate the city's mobile laborers and implement centralized quarantine. Those who are confirmed to have the plague will be immediately isolated. Currently, the Medical, Police, Social, and Health Bureaus are working together to carry out this work." (September 4th) With such active plague prevention, it is expected that it will soon achieve great results. However, for the Beijing citizens who have been struggling against hunger since spring, this time they must not only resist hunger but also resist the plague. (August 4th)</p>

<h3>Should Teachers Exchange Pens for Guard Posts?</h3>
<p>One</p>
<p>The mission of education and youth does not need to be defined in theory as important. Without time or space, [unclear character] cannot ignore its unique position. For example, when friendly nations dealt with the concession not long ago, they once solemnly declared that they would do their best to protect education and that education and youth workers could rest assured.</p>
<p>However, the Shanghai First District Baojia Office (or perhaps it is not the intention of the highest Baojia authority) still issued a notice requiring teachers to take turns on guard duty, which is truly perplexing.</p>
<p>The work of the self-defense corps is to watch out for each other, while the mission of teachers is to cultivate talents. The guard duty of the self-defense corps only lasts for a few hours, while the duties of teachers are lifelong. Today, when we are singing loudly about respecting teachers and providing relief to teachers, it is a strange thing to order teachers to take turns on guard duty. Now, all Yin Shi is imitating Eastern products. I wonder if Japanese schools have regulations to suspend classes for a certain number of hours every ten days so that teachers can be on guard duty. I sincerely hope that the Baojia authorities will sympathize with the teachers. (Peng Ruogu)</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Since the implementation of Baojia in this city, incidents of theft and intimidation have decreased day by day, which shows that the Baojia system is well-intentioned. The authorities and all staff members have worked hard to promote it, and residents should all remember it deeply and praise it unanimously.</p>
<p>Among the residents, those who are most grateful to Baojia are teachers. In the past two years, the Baojia authorities have repeatedly stated in their official documents that teachers are allowed to be exempt from service in the civil police corps. They believe that teachers have arduous work, meager salaries, difficult lives, and important responsibilities. The Baojia authorities have insight into the hidden situation and have specially exempted them from guard duty. Their virtue is truly abundant. Therefore, teachers are all moved to tears, and students and parents alike praise them endlessly. "Teachers are exempt from service." The Baojia's kindness is the most excellent and abundant. However, the Lian Bao chiefs do not understand this intention and often do not allow exemption from service, rejecting applications, so that the authorities' virtue cannot flow downward, and the lower situation cannot reach upward. I wonder what their intention is. (Jiyuan)</p>

<h3>Gathering of Elders During the Mid-Autumn Festival to Preach the Way of Health and Longevity</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Social Service Department of this newspaper specially held an exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow Association on the fourth floor to hold a forum for the elderly and promote the holy way of respecting the elderly and good works. More than 30 people attended, including Shen Tianxin, Zhu Mouxian, Zhu Juefo, and Li Jian. First, Director Huang introduced the elders to each other and stated that his colleagues care about providing for the elderly, helping the elderly, providing comfort for the elderly, and respecting the elderly, and that they had specially invited elders from all walks of life to gather in one room on this auspicious day to encourage each other. Preventing people from helping to give and accumulate good fortune is beneficial to descendants, and assisting the lonely, weak, old, sick, and poor, wishing you all happiness, longevity, health, and peace.</p>
<p>Next, Dr. Ding Fulao, a medical expert, spoke about the needs of the average person, which can be divided into eight categories. 1. Good health, 2. Long life, 3. Sufficient food and drink, 4. Comfortable sleep, 5. Financial satisfaction, 6. Fulfilling sexual desires, 7. Peaceful children, 8. Being respected by others. Wang Angsun, a health expert, spoke about the ancients who practiced guidance and abstinence from grains and lived a long life, which is only one in a hundred, but those who are spiritually complete and physically healthy, and have been blessed by nature, must first have a way to cure diseases, be good at the art of nourishing the body, think less to nourish the heart, reduce sexual desire to nourish the kidneys, avoid anger to nourish the liver, eat lightly to nourish the body, save words to nourish the spirit, read more to nourish the courage, and follow the seasons to nourish the vitality. The human body occasionally suffers from the erosion of wind, cold, heat, and humidity, but it only needs sufficient energy and a complete spirit. If one can live a life without worries, then the spirit will be free from stagnation, and the body will naturally be healthy. Therefore, not worrying is the secret to curing diseases and prolonging life. Next, Sun Xiangzhong, an educator, spoke about today being the Mid-Autumn Festival, "The moon is exceptionally bright on Mid-Autumn Festival," which symbolizes our elders being clear, bright, and noble, just like the bright moon on Mid-Autumn Festival. Today, young and old gather together, which can be said to be three generations in the same party. Relying on raising children to prevent old age is unreliable. Filial piety is certainly necessary, and parental love is also natural. If children are unfilial, everyone will criticize them. If parents are not compassionate, many people will ignore it. This is not very appropriate with Confucius [unclear character]. Therefore, the elderly should advocate morality and culture for society and lead the group to peace and prosperity. Next, Zhao Ximing, Chen Chunhua, Shen Simin, and others all advocated rectifying the three cardinal guides, clarifying the five human relations, and practicing the eight virtues. They also visited Fang Wen, who wielded his pen to greet guests, and sighed at his talent. After tea and photography, they adjourned and went to the park to enjoy the moon.</p>
<h3>Hospitals Offer Assistance to Patients</h3>
<p>Youzhu Hospital claims: At present, everything is extremely expensive, and the salaried class is the most miserable, especially the education sector. From now on, if friends in the cultural field are ill and wish to come here for treatment, please have your company sign a certificate. During the prescribed hours, 10-12am and 4-6pm, all will be examined.</p>
<p>The Foguang Rest Home at 123 Mas Road has specially invited lung disease expert Dr. Ma Wenwo to provide free diagnosis and treatment from 11am to 3pm every day and issue examination reports. The number of patients is limited to ten per day, and registration is required every other day.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association has written to say: The general medicines in the letter of September 8 will be supplied by the hospital, and the cost of the medicines will be paid from donations. If the funds are insufficient, donations will be continued. The patient referral form should be signed by you and stamped with the round seal of the Social Service Department, etc. Our association will act accordingly and has notified Director Ouyang Zhong and Deputy Director and Medical Director Zhang Chenmei to take note and handle it. The hospital's clinic hours are from 9am to 12pm, and it is closed on Sundays.</p>
<h3>Pudong Fellow Association Provides Diagnosis and Medicine</h3>
<p>The Pudong Fellow Association's Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic will be further improved from this month: House calls are free of charge (registration fee is also waived). Each person will be issued a medicine voucher worth five yuan. Prescriptions from designated pharmacies will not only enjoy special discounts, but the medicine vouchers will also be fully accepted. The medicines are all packaged in bulk, which is exactly the same as those sold in stores. All poor and sick people, regardless of their origin, can go for diagnosis. The clinic is located in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Sanatorium at 78 Luzon Road.</p>
<h3>Sino-French Vocational School Enrollment</h3>
<p>The Sino-French Advanced Industrial Vocational School (the old site of the Sino-French Institute of Technology at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route Albert), is jointly run by the Sino-French authorities based on foreign exchange documents. It is divided into three departments: Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Civil Engineering. It utilizes the original equipment of the Sino-French Institute of Technology and focuses on practical training. It has now been approved by the Ministry of Education to start enrollment. The tuition and miscellaneous fees are only 200 yuan. Apply quickly.</p>
