<p>社評</p>
<h3>展開科學運動</h3>
<p>科學是人類文明進步的利器，科學發達的國家，必然是富强的國家；反之，科學落後的國家，則終不免於貧弱。特別是在目前戰爭中的各國，都有了高度發展的科學技術、從戰爭機構到生產陣綫，無不依照科學的方法，利用科學的成果、以與對方爭取一日之長，而奠國家於安全之域。所以，有人說，現代戰爭，是科學的戰爭，決不是無稽之談。</p>
<p>就此次世界大戰中的若干顯例而言，科學進步的國家，一定把握戰爭的勝利的。如日本佐藤軍務局長在四月十四日的陸軍技術研究會席上演說所指出的：「去年夏季的北非戰爭」德義軍一夜中攻克杜勃魯克要塞，長驅直入埃及，亞歷山大在望。這一戰役之偉大的成功，實由於德軍對戰爭兵器的發明，與戰車冷氣裝置的新改良所致。今冬紅軍的冬間攻擊，所以有意外的力量者，實因紅軍戰卓及對戰車乓器的準備，與這些機械化部隊之運用訓練的澈底，爲有力的主因。」同樣的，日本在太平洋上的勝利，除了戰士們的作戰精神，將帥的戰略優越之外，又歸功於日本數十年來專心研究科學發達的結果。</p>
<p>本報連日刊載日本科學研究之成績，從這裏可以看出一個國家之强盛及其作戰之所向無敵，使一向以世界最强大的工業國家自誇的英美一再敗北，決不是徼倖得來的。然而日本重工業部門的發展，本來較爲後進，所以生產科學，無寗說是相當遲緩的，只在戰爭以來，特別是最近，才有驚人的躍進，而日本當局和科學界人士，仍不認爲滿足，還在努力研求更大的成績，以謀從質到量，都能駕凌英美而確立科學戰的必要態勢。</p>
<p>中國在現代是文化落後產業幼稚的國家，科學運動雖然發軔於戊戍運動之時，由於其後連年天災人禍內憂外患，政府固然無暇於科學事業之倡導，而有志之士也無從安心研究，與當世列强的科學進展的情形相較，自不能無望洋之興嘆。今天的時代已經不是「日出而作，日入而息，雞犬之聲相聞，民至老死不相往還」的古代，古聖先賢的玄學哲理，或是所謂「精神戰略」，決不能適用於現在環境，而能拯救我國家民族的了。更自積極方面而言，，我們現在是已向英美等科學發達的國家宣戰，自視現在落後的科學情形，更當急赳直追，迎頭趕上，從速展開科學運動。</p>
<p>爲了展開科學運動，我們首先期望政府當局以日本在短時間內趕上英美的事實作根據，接受日本科學界艱苦奮鬥的經驗，確立全國發展科學運動的方針，先由中央及地方政府指定相當確定的款項，一方面改善大學及專門學校的學科，加多科學研究的鐘點；另一方面，獎勵民間一切科學的發明和研究，對有志科學者給予物質上的援助。</p>
<p>其决，我們希望已經成立的公私科學研究機關，應在政府指導之下，有計劃的統一與聯繫，完成戰時科學動員體制。同時，共謀科學技術與產業間的密切聯系與配合，除去彼此間一切疏隔及矛盾，使科學技術得在增進生產上盡其最大的機能。</p>
<p>再次，我們更希望如日本輿論所希望一樣，確立對勤勞發明的報償制，對科學技術者，予以精神上的優遇。日本早有「技術有功章，」「勤勞顯功章」等規則，德國對於科學發明者；也有贈予「榮譽章」的辦法，此在中國科學人材缺乏之時、這種優越的獎勵，更不可少。</p>
<p>最後，我們更期望於日本科學技術界，對於發展中國科學運動，尤其在人材的培育和技術的指導方面，給與莫大的援助。最近日本東條首相說過，現在的戰爭，是「天天科學和科學，技術和技術的角逐」（四月十六日日本朝日新聞社論引語），我們深願當局與科學界人士知所奮勉！</p>

<h3>首都紀念表年節　汪主席親臨致訓辭　應理解新國民運動精神　努力復與中華保衛東亞</h3>
<p>南京五日中央社電日今日爲新中國第一屆靑年節。按此靑年節乃係國父孫先生在廣東就任大總統之日所規定者，此間新運會宣傳部，敎育部，社會福利部，及南京特別市政府爲慶祝起見，特共同主辦第一屆靑年節運動大會。今日上午九時起，在國立中央大學體育塲盛大舉行，南京全市大中小舉校男女學生參加靑少年團代表選手的五百名，開會時汪主席着大元帥禮服，躬臨致訓詞。略謂値茲靑年節，全國學生除應理解新國民運動之精神外，並須以活潑之精神，健康之身體，達成復興中華，保衛東亞之使命。詞意懇摯，聆者莫不動容。訓辭畢，遂開始運動各項競技，均極精彩，充分發揮新中國戰下靑年之活躍。</p>
<p>甫京五日中央社電　首都靑少年慶祝靑年節運動會於五日上午九時起，繼四日舉行競賽項目。會塲四周觀衆如堵，各康兒奮勇爭先，同時各校並舉行團體表演，精采節目甚多，尤以中大實中女生之健身操，更博觀衆之采聲。下午五時，各項競賽，表演完畢，成績甚爲優良。</p>
<h3>葉蓬在日發青談話　闡述考察感想　日軍素質優秀軍械精良　中國建軍必須日本協助</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　中國訪日軍事考察團於四月廿七日抵東京後，即考察日陸軍關係各方面狀况，以貢獻於中國建軍工作。該團團長國府陸軍部長葉蓬上將及副團長第二方面軍總司令孫良誠，軍事委員會參謀决長項致莊中將，華北綏靖軍憲兵司令邵文凱中將，駐日武官王維藩中將等，中國陸軍首腦將領，三日曾於此間帝國飯店談述此次訪日感想，及到將來建軍完成後，中日提携之熱烈信念。團長葉蓬上將謂：「四月二十九日參加天長節閱兵式時，最感驚佩者厥爲日陸軍機械化裝備之完善，士兵技術之優秀。是日閱兵塲上空日空軍之演習，尤令人感佩不已。確信日本陸軍爲世界最優秀之軍隊，此乃因日軍人理解皇室中心生義之獨特精神使然，同時曾受嚴密之敎育訓練，故有今日之成績。其次關於軍需生產方面，僅就本人於短時間中所見之工塲而言例如以日本獨特之技術製成之戰車，比較德國製者爲優現認此亦係日本國民精神之表現。中國軍隊現僅止於與日軍協力恢復治安中之程度，將來宜改善敎育，使素質向上，培養實力，以從事大東亞戰爭，樹立與日軍同樣軍隊，此乃中國陸軍幹部一致之熱望。然近代之裝備，若無日本之密切協助，終無從着手。最近重慶抗戰力低下，乃極顯著之事實，其原因不外日本尊重中國獨立自主之立塲，並予以誠意協助，故渝方喪失抗戰意義。日本繼續六年間之戰鬥，國力愈益充實，及直接與英美作戰後，復於東亞確保不動之戰略優勢，重慶輸血路被封鎖，僅殘存西北公路，因美國援助無方，故事實上亦無法繼續自力抗戰。如斯重慶治下之國民覺悟英國不足恃，認抗戰爲無益，乃屬當然。中國參戰後，全國漸决統一，均希望與友邦日本協力，共同建設大東亞共榮圈。</p>
<h3>冀中日軍　擴大戰果　隴海線亦奏捷</h3>
<p>北京五日中央社電　據冀中日軍前綫五日電訊，日軍包圍冀中分散渝軍後，復切斷其相互間之聯絡，實行各個擊破。自三日以來，戰果益大，該處渝軍即將全部被殲。當三日拂曉，日軍先擊潰定縣北方附近渝軍，並燬其糧秣倉庫，刻正繼續掃蕩中。又日軍某部部隊肅淸該分區東方渝軍後，又繼續追擊，並於途中截獲渝軍藏匿大批白米，又威脅其運輸綫。另一日軍部隊於搜查該分區西方筒龍山，北方山後洞窟時，發見渝軍遺棄之迫擊砲二鬥，步槍六枝，及地雷被服，其他軍用品等甚夥。四日又在唐縣西北赤城東南山地，攻擊渝軍殘部，一舉將其擊潰。</p>
<p>徐州五日中央社電　日軍最近在隴海綫碭山東南二十五公里附近，猛攻渝第九十三軍李仙洲所部的二千人，刻正繼續擴大戰果中。三四兩日戰鬥結果，渝軍遺屍五五二具，被俘四八人，日軍截獲迫擊砲四門，重機槍一挺，子彈三二五零發，步槍一九六枝，步槍彈一五〇〇發，刺刀四三柄，手溜彈四六零顆，及地雷等甚礬。</p>
<p>南京五日中央社電　據日軍報道部於五日會見記者時發表稱：最近於太行山作戰之日軍部隊，四月廿日以來對華北殘存之渝方軍隊予以重大之打擊，現尙繼續攻擊，至五月三日止，其戰果經判明者如下：渝方戰死者五七五七入，俘虜九六八三人，鹵獲兵器計小槍四八七一支，輕機槍二九四挺，重機槍四〇挺，迫擊砲十六門，山砲六門。</p>
<p>漢口四日中央社電　日軍最近在武漢周圍討伐狀况如决：四月二十八日對德安東北十四公里附近蠢動之敵，進行急襲，並擊潰之。二十九日來襲彌陀寺東南方十公里冉家塲之敵，僅交戰一時餘，遂向西方潰走，遺屍體六具，步槍七挺。二十九日午後四時崇陽東南二十五公里老虎台附近發現敵軍的一百人，遂向之加以猛攻，遺棄屍體十五具。五月一日京山西南方十公里在甘家冲附近之新四軍的四百人，爲我襲擊，遺屍三十九具，虜獲十二人，輕機槍一挺，步槍四十挺。</p>
<h3>日派遣軍部隊研究　黑熱病流行狀況</h3>
<p>北京五日中央社電　日中國派遣軍部隊常於作戰事暇後，孜孜研究各種醫築，以謀根絕流行於中國之傳染病。如最近已發現撲滅黑熱病及防止赤痢虎列拉病菌之預防藥，造福於中國民衆者至鉅。其中黑熱病爲中國北方特有之風土病，歷年沿黃河流域蔓延各地，爲害甚烈。日軍農村部隊前爲撲滅此項惡疫，曾於二年半前着手研究，分赴中國北方各地實地調查，並歷訪中日德義法比瑞等十三國醫院，精密調查其病源，迄今一年有半，始獲得結論，即黑熱病流行最猖獗之地帶在江蘇安徽兩省北方之徐州，淮安，海州一帶。當十九世紀中葉後，曾在睢寗，靈擅，泗縣一帶附近釀成大疫，並探悉其目前蔓延狀態，的分四路，一沿津浦路北上，至濟南後沿膠濟路東進；由海州附近經海路至芝罘威海衛一帶；三沿平漢路北上而至北京；四沿隴海路傳佈至西安方面。又黑熱病之感染期，多在五月至七月間，迨至八九月時即行發生在拔海較低之平原，流行於石灰質冲積層地帶及死水湖沼較多之鄉村間。又另一日軍部隊硏究中國大陸方面虎列拉病菌之結果，確信此項病菌靜越洋而來，乃悉係目中國南方及南洋方面蔓延而來者，深信以流行細菌作預防虎列拉接種菌苗，其免疫功效，可謂最大</p>
<h3>林宣傳部長　宴日報界</h3>
<p>南京五日中央社電　林宣傳部長於五日下午六時三十分，假中日文化協會歡宴日本每日新聞社社長奧村氏等數人，宣傳部郭决長等均奉邀出席</p>

<h3>李士羣談廣東清鄉問題　實施日期尚　未決定　凖備工作業已開始</h3>
<p>南京五日中央社電　淸鄕委員會秘書長李士羣日前奉命赴廣東，指導粵省籌備淸鄕事宜，已於二日飛返首都。記者特於五日上午訪謁李氏於其官邸，當承發表談話如下：「本人此次奉在兼委員長命赴粵，洽商籌備淸鄕事宜，係於上月廿九日首途。按本人前任警政部長時代，會爲視察粵省警政而赴粵，今决舊地重臨，雖隔日無多，而粵省政之進步，以廣州一市言，已擁有人口七十二萬之多，具見治安鞏固，經濟繁榮，敎育方面更有躍著之進展，靑少年組織訓練工作之精密嚴格，實爲全國之冠，此殆皆陳省長之領導有方，及各當局之努力有以致之也。至於粵省淸鄕事宜，即將以陳省長爲中心，在淸鄕委員會的領導下，活潑展開。本人廿九日抵粵，卅日即召開淸鄉座談會，共策進行，陳省長及當地友邦連絡部長等均出席與議。協議結果，意見極爲一致，故返京以後，業已報吿委座，請示決定。現在粵省淸鄉大致約有兩大問題：（一）即人力的準備工作，如黨政軍警封鎖宣傳人員之訓練工作；（二）即財政問題，以現在粵省情形而言，如單獨負担淸鄕費用，恐感困難，中樞方面富稍於補助，其正式開始淸鄉日期，目下雖尙未確定，但準備工作則業已開始。將來當斟酌情形，或將倣照各地辦理淸鄉成例辦理。請委會粵省分會由陳省長兼任主任，以期黨政軍警之一元化。淸鄕工作一經開始，行見治安加强，民生改善，不僅拓展粵省之政治力，亦所以拓展國府之政治力也。』</p>

<p>柏林五日中央社電　此間德意志民衆新聞報，於四日刊載日陸軍報道部長谷萩少將，四月三十日在名古屋演講關於大東亞戰爭之現狀之消息評述，預測日軍即將冉度展開大規模攻勢。略謂，今日之日軍較之大東亞戰爆發時，已大爲增强，誠如谷萩少將所謂，日軍無論於何時伺地，均有可展開大規模新攻勢之態勢，日軍於開戰後，四月間，即獲得無盡量之蘊藏資源，而獲得足以獨立繼續戰爭之地位，日本之海軍力，目前已較開戰時增强八倍，英美兩軍於歐洲戰域與德軍對抗之時，若認日軍係袖手傍觀時，則將自食其果，關於此點，谷萩少將曾謂，日本爲展開大規模攻勢起見，目前必須進行準備標語，含意極深，反軸心國軍事專家雖未預測日軍將於何時展開攻勢，但對於日軍在太平洋上之靜觀態度，近將終結，意見　完全一致云。</p>
<h3>日國民儲蓄數額激</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日大藏省頃發表昭和十七年度（民卅一年）一年間，日國民儲蓄總額爲三百三十四億五千七百萬圓，較原定額二百三十億圓，超過達四億五千七百萬圓</p>
<h3>達爾文港空戰大敗後　澳人懊喪殊甚　日空軍長距離猛烈轟炸　或將成爲對澳攻勢先聲</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城五日中央社電　日航空部隊於二日空襲達爾文港後，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部僅發表稱，空戰損失甚大，此外對於正確數字，毫未發表，因可推知日航空部隊此次之攻擊，所予澳洲之打擊，似頗重大。澳軍司令部當局，四日曾談稱，日軍今後或將連續轟炸澳洲，以偵察澳軍實力，由此次戰鬬，可知日航空部　實具有實行遠距離大舉轟炸之實力云。同時澳洲朝野亦議論紛紜，而反軸心陣營所誇稱世界最優秀之英製噴火式戰鬬機，此次空戰毫未發揮威力一事，已成爲議論暗點，澳洲廣播電臺並有如决之滑稽廣播，「噴火式機隊所以受到非常損害者，乃因天氣惡劣之故，噴火式機隊與敵機空戰之結果，不得已被迫至遙遠洋上，空戰終了返回時，途中因遇逆風，故發生事故頗我。前此吾人即認爲噴火式覆駕駛員，頗可與日空軍周旋，故如立於對等地位，當不致敗戰。因此吾人前此之自信，毫無頹喪之理由云云。又反軸心軍司令部亦稱，「因天氣惡劣，致損失極大」。英人特派員亦謂與日空軍交戰，被擊落者中，曾有數駕駛員乘降落傘而得活命。然此實不足予澳人以安慰云。</p>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電</p>
<p>前任美聯社駐香港特派員蓋德，今日由澳洲西北部某前方空軍根據地發出消息，謂星期日達爾文港之遭空襲，可表示日本空軍長距離猛烈轟炸之能力，或將成爲對澳之攻勢。澳之航空專家咸信，日方此次空襲的之主要目，係試探反軸心軍之空防力量。據此間所得報吿，一致聲言日方現正加强現有之機塲，並從事添築新塲，以增進其地位。此次轟炸，已表示日空軍，能由遼遠基地中出發，作强有力之襲擊云。駐於達爾文港之噴火式戰鬬機，星期日曾升空截擊日機，惟在該港附近阿拉夫萊海上空作戰時，頗受損失，澳方公報已承認此項事實矣。</p>
<h3>日本戰爭科學上的新利器</h3>
<p>新的格納庫建築法　「當然，因爲基礎的硏究，還沒有充分的自信，以後將繼續努力』。這是陸軍航空本部的建技大尉高山馨氏的話。</p>
<p>高山大尉完成了僅用釘把木材結合起來而造成大建築物的方法。開闊四十二公尺的大格納庫，可以不用鋼材，很堅固地造成，建築速度上的時間大大地被縮短了，在今後的木造建築上，實是一次大革新。在匠人建造家屋時的狀態中可以見到，木材與木材的結合，要築成拚合的建築物的骨幹。有種種複雜的接筍結連起來，而如其要建造大建築物，更須要鐵栓。鐵銷等種種鋼材，把結合處紥緊。在建造骨幹的塲合，完全用不着釘，僅在上梁的時候，始使用釘。這是木造建築法的常道。木材的製造筍縫，要很久的時間，使用鐵栓等又須很多的鋼材。用釘釘合起來，那就非常經濟而迅速了。</p>
<p>高山大尉在中國事變勃發的翌年，卽昭和十三年春起，的半年間，利用工作的餘暇，埋首用釘的研究，結果，用四英吋長的所謂「三寸釘」可以建造大的建築物，而短期間建築格納庫也變成可能。從建築的常道說來，這是極危險的方法，關係者很不放心，故沒有人請敎，假使這方法能够實現，那麽以前格納庫中所使用的鐵骨，可以節省下來造大砲，造戰車，造彈丸，這無論如何終須使之實現，因而遂有上面的「繼續努力』的話，其熱心終於打動了關係者的心，於昭和十三年秋，開始動工。</p>
<p>即使用鐵骨，要造四十公尺開闊的骨幹，亦非易事。而木材如只用釘結合起來，那麼在工事的進行中，隨時擔心有倒壞的可能，一般人即因此而不放心。高山大尉充滿着自信，督勵依照其指圖組成巨大的骨幹，翌年十四年三月，完成了雄偉的大格納庫，人們的驚異當然改變過來，從其開始以來，經過四年的歲月，日本最初的用釘釘合的大建築物完成之後，一面繼續用這方法建造營房，講堂等，也很美滿的成功了。在陸軍方面，建造了四十棟這樣的建築物，節的八千五百噸的鋼材，節减了一百五十萬圓的費用，而建築的時間亦僅佔以前的百分之七十。所以在木造建築的將來，實有很大的貢獻。</p>
<p>「普通所使用的大十六公厘的鐵栓，一根可以作四吋的釘三十五根。而這鐵栓的耐力，不過在十根釘以內。這並不能說是特別的發見或發明，不過把沒有充分利用的釘，再硏究而加以利用而已。用日本的松木和杉木建築，實際上已表示着祇要釘已經很够了。用這方法之後，木材也不必再刻筍縫了，其他困難的技術也母需了。家屋也可以很簡單的建造起來。技術的園田裏，大體都保持着保守的傾向，我的方法，有很多人以爲是很危險的，四年來研究的結果，終於完成了大格納庫的建造。學界方面從本年春季起也開始注重釘的硏究民間不久也能實行罷！」</p>
<p>昭和十年，高山大尉卒業於東大工學部建築學科，卒業仍不斷研究，本其可信，務使不可能成爲可能。這一點，對所有從事於硏究的科學者，指示一條「戰時下研究」的大道。（翔：譯自四月二十日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>突尼西亞西部戰綫　英症狀新攻勢被撃退　軸心軍退出瑪蒂爾後　突境戰事轉入新階段</h3>
<p>羅馬五日中央社電義軍司令部本日發衣戰報如决：（一）反軸心軍在突尼西亞西部戰綫，以砲兵及　車隊與主力部隊相協力，展開新攻勢，但均被軸心軍擊退，是役以義軍第二十七步兵聯隊第三部隊作戰最勇。（一）德戰鬥機隊於空戰中撃落敵機三架。（一）軸心轟炸機隊，反覆轟炸波奴　敵軍港灣設施，（一）反軸心軍轟炸機隊空襲義本土太蘭多及勒佐地區，受害甚微。</p>
<p>羅馬五日中央社電軍界人士之意見，軸心軍退出瑪蒂爾後，比塞大之防務，巳轉入新階段。該地在比塞大湖及高山雙重掩護之下，保障甚爲堅面，至於反軸心軍以摩洛哥軍隊攻擊比塞大前綫之事實，大的不外兩項理由，（一）反軸心軍總指揮部認比塞大區域之戰事，將成爲突尼西亞全部戰役中之最激烈者，故爲避免白人軍隊犧牲過大計，乃調摩洛哥人充當砲灰。（一）比塞大　英美及法叛軍皆欲據爲巳有之地，如以彼等進攻，難免不引起衝突，愛森霍華將軍爲避免此項衝突計，乃調摩洛哥軍隊進攻之。</p>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　據倫敦瑞典記者消息，倫敦谷界，以爲軸心軍之退出馬蒂爾爲突尼西亞戰最後階段之轉換點。謹愼觀察家警吿公衆，須防德方所佈之陷穽，蓋德軍激烈反攻，極屬可　也，該記者鄭重謂，即素抱樂觀之英人，亦以爲戰局雖似有利於反軸心國，然認爲軸心國之即將崩潰，則嫌過早，同時比塞大之堡壘，並未受嚴重威脅，蓋其外圍初未受損，此種法人所建之山石防禦工程，殊使德義軍隊獲得優勢不少云。</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　海通社軍事訪員稱，安德森將軍曾於上週末抽調大批生力軍隊，尤其爲砲隊，增援西第尼塞爾區傑夫那關口之第一軍左翼，此事頗出人意料，因此美軍在該方面對軸心軍陣地之壓力，乃見增，若干日來，瑪蒂爾城常處於英美軍長距離砲位猛烈轟擊之下，軸心軍鑒於此種局勢，巳決定將突尼西亞前綫北側之陣地，作有系統之徹退，是瑪蒂爾城亦在徹退之列，惟美步兵跟蹤繼進，頗爲遲緩，故德義軍未與之發生遭遇戰。就理論上而言，反軸心軍方面之行動，的有以下兩種可能性，（一）美軍或將繼續西向突尼斯海灣之沿岸推進，俾可截斷駐比塞大德義軍與阿爾寗將軍主要部隊之聯絡。（一）美軍或折而向南及東南，此項運動如　成功，則將使德巴巴之德義軍陣地，感受嚴重威脅，目可爲英第一軍中心部隊開關至突尼斯之孔道。惟德義軍各領袖對之，或已有必要抵抗之準備矣。突尼西亞前方之中南兩段地區，目前均無變化，截至星期一晚止，此地區內反軸心軍之活動，祇限於砲火及斥堠反軸心軍之將再度發展其活動，自可無疑，尤其在梅傑茲愛爾巴勃以東與彭杜法斯以西之區域爲更然。其唯一目的，係在　制德軍，使其不能抽調預備隊，抵禦向北側面前　之美軍。就兩勢而觀，反軸心　同時大舉進攻中北兩段地區，甚　可　，且巳迫近。再就一般地勢觀察，集中於阿爾及　之大批英美軍隊，雖或有其他用途，不僅露突尼西亞之戰事而巳。但無論如何，反軸心指揮部曾利用此項預備股，精銳以增援在突尼西亞作戰部隊，則可斷言，是以未來戰事中，反軸心軍之數量，仍　　在德義軍之上，惟軸心軍現仍扼守之區域，則在撤退運動完成之後，更形縮小也。</p>
<h3>蘇境克里姆斯加雅　劇戰仍在進行中　德軍轉移陣地至該鎮西面</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　海通社軍事特派員稱，蘇軍對穗羅聯　所守之庫班橋頭堡，　巴不斷進攻達一星期之久，蘇軍所蒙之人力及物力損失，雖亦非常嚴重，但蘇　之壓力不獨不减，反而增加，蘇軍在攻擊中，屢决將其進攻之焦點移動於東面側翼之山嶺地區，至庫班河口之鹹湖地區之間，自星期一午刻以後，克里姆斯加雅東南面之戰鬥最爲激烈，該處戰鬥現仍進行中，劇勢朱减。據柏林軍事專家稱，蘇聯以强大之　兵隊及砲隊作戰，僅偶然使用坦克車，斯誠値得注意。蘇軍因集中於一狹小之地區，使用大量之精銳部隊，故能突淮德軍之陣綫，但進入德軍陣地之蘇軍，皆被立即截斷，與其主力部隊隔離。德軍現正猛烈作戰，以圖奪回蘇軍突入之地，蘇軍又有新增部隊展開，此足見紅軍指揮部之意，仍欲繼續攻擊。現時之局勢，又表明蘇方對於庫班橋頭堡其爲重視，蘇認其爲德方威音高加索之根據地，且　德軍可能的大規模攻勢之出發點也。</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　有資格之德國軍界方面昨晚宣稱，蘇軍一連四日，向德軍庫班橋頭堡地區之克里姆斯加雅鎮東面之德軍陣地攻擊，德軍現已撤離該鎮，而移至該鎮西面前已準備完善之較強陣地。當蘇軍於星期一晨，又以重砲及飛機協助向該處德軍舊陣地攻撃時，該處僅有斷後之部隊應戰。德軍撤退前，巳將一切供應及軍用品携去，並將重要軍事設施完全毀壞。</p>
<h3>美將再遣　戴維思赴蘇　寇爾訪莫洛托夫</h3>
<p>阿姆斯達丹四日中央社電德國新聞社訊，據倫敦來電稱，英國駐蘇大使寇爾，訪問蘇聯外交委員長莫洛托夫，傳達英政府對於蘇波斷絕外交關係一事之意見，寇爾對此間　，或將在英斯科作更進一步之談話。</p>
<p>般諾愛里斯五日中央社電　據本日華盛頓消息，華盛頓當局，現正考慮再派戴維思赴莫斯科，邀睛史太林與羅期福總統及邱吉爾首相，舉行特別會議。據悉，戴維思最近曾與羅斯福總統討論此事。</p>
<h3>艾登深望蘇波　速謀解決糾紛</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城五日中央社電英外相艾登，會於四日在下院表示，深望蘇波兩國政府，以「政治識見，」解決此次兩國糾紛。但波蘭亡命政府總理薛柯爾斯基於四日夜在倫教中央廣播電台所發表之廣播中，仍顯示强硬態度，故糾紛　勢，乃更趨惡化，預料蘇聯將在莫斯科榭立赤色波蘭政府之說，亦益爲有力。紐的泰晤士報倫敦訪員所傳消息中，曾率直表明情勢巳趨嚴重，大意謂蘇波兩國之此次糾紛，固爲德宣傳部長郭培爾所促成，但如反軸心陣營之種種破綻再被發覺，則即將釀成空前未有之破裂局面。目前波蘭亡命政府之立塲，可謂進退維谷，波蘭因拒絕希特勒總統之要求但澤自由巿，而結果竟喪失國土之大半，此實　法解說蘇聯政府爲保護本國，認爲有劃定新國界之必要，努力發展在東歐之擊力，蘇政府之政策，在求獲得較多之領土，且欲使反軸心國關闢第二戰綫，而後始能實現蘇聯與英美兩國之緊密合作云云。此次羅期福之派遣心腹戴維斯赴莫斯科，衆認卽在企圖打開反軸心陣營之重大危機，但據紐的泰晤士報　　所傳，雙方之同床異夢，業巳完全暴露，且其　勢亦益　表面化云</p>
<h3>澳外相在美　與美首腦會談</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城五日中央社電　據華盛頓電，澳外相愛伏特，於三日會見美武器租借局長霍浦金斯後，四日復會見羅斯福，力言西南太平洋戰局之重大化，要求增派援軍。按愛伏特抵華盛頓以來，曾屢與美政府當局及反軸心軍聯合司令部首腦會見。會談之主旨在要求　派援車。惟據澳洲拉撤電台華盛頓特派員來電稱，愛伏特與美政府當局之會談，現已遭逢危機。</p>

<h3>世界史上的一大悲劇</h3>
<p>— 德富豬一郎</p>
<p>（一）徹底的海盜主義的因果</p>
<p>如果說現代是有一大悲劇的，那就是大英帝國自趨崩潰的事實吧。世界上的人們，無論是敵是友，都給目下戰爭的多事多端所繚亂，對於這展開在眼前的大悲劇，差不多尙還沒有注意到。這恰像德川幕府的末期，日本國民十之八九，對於已經失掉了靈魂而僅存軀殼的當時慕府，還如同三代將軍家光或是八代將軍吉宗的幕府一樣看待，如出一轍。勝海曾經詠着道：</p>
<p>「　留不住的千尋碇纔，隨波漂泊，行方所屆有誰知！」</p>
<p>也不知道現在掛着大英帝國首相的招牌之邱吉爾，果然有着那樣的覺悟嗎？</p>
<p>古時羅馬大將軍西彼俄·大阿非利加那（Scipio　Africannr　Major）征服迦太基，把它的都城付之一炬，他　睜睜看着這曾在地中海南岸豪華的大都府，寖寖地成爲焦土的光景，爲，一然地想起了詩聖荷馬詠着的特羅伊滅亡的詩句而慨歎着。不知道對於這做着現代迦太基的英國，也有爲之揮着一掬同情之淚的人嗎？英國的一大戲曲家莎士比亞，倘使他復生於今日，也恐怕要投筆而太　於力不從心的吧！</p>
<p>所謂大英帝國他者，一直到現在爲止，是世界上首屈一指的富國强國，同時也是一個數一數二的文化國。然而這個國家，其國家的壽命，雖然已經垂二千年；可是其成爲大英帝國的壽命，却只及其四分之一，還不過是四五百年間的光景。具體的說來，應該是在依利薩伯女王以後。英國發展史（Ｅxpansion　of　Fngland，1883）的著者西利（SirJ．R．Seeley）說道。。</p>
<p>「在依利薩伯女王晚年，英國在歐洲以外尙還全然沒有屬地，大英帝國尙還沒有存在。蘇格蘭尙還是別個國家，在愛爾蘭的英國勢力，也只不過是在異人民之間的小殖民地罷了」。</p>
<p>像這樣，所以大英帝國的發展，是極爲近代的。可是這個比了葡萄牙，比了西班牙，比了荷蘭，甚至比了法蘭西，都較爲後進的英國，到底是怎樣地會得建成那麼樣的大帝國，而發展到「英國女皇維多利亞的領地，不見日落」的呢？那不消說，完全是從海盜的行徑，靠着賊星高照，而無往不利。現在且舉出一個例子。克倫威爾時代的英國原是個所謂極端的新敎國，依照着自由民權的本義，以成就其革命的。然而當時的庫伯（WilliamCowper），却這樣地說:</p>
<p>「荷蘭無論在海洋，在新世界，是我國商業上的一大競爭奢。所以縱令它是新敎徒的勢力，也非把它滅亡不可；縱令要借舊敎徒國的援助，來把它滅亡，也是在所不惜的。」他們乃是具着這樣的居心，完全用着暴力，以賊害與之爲對手之競爭者的。</p>
<p>即英國的戰爭，並不是簡單的爭覇戰爭，其內底裏，還一定隱伏着商業上利害的計算。　像英法間的戰爭，也是因爲法國在北美有了先鞭，後來英國要加以攘奪而引起來的；就是在印度，也是如此的。總之，英國的戰爭，是商業本位的戰爭，自始成爲問題的，只是利益上合算不合算的打量。即他們並不是一時的海盜或偶爲的海盜，而是恒久的，有計劃的，而又是大規模之連續的，普通的海盜行爲。</p>
<p>苟其有可致勝，勝而有所利得的把握時，那末就要立刻下手　做。至其對手之爲誰爲某，那是全然不在意上的，非至目的達到，不肯罷休。這樣，他們竟在新世界，也建成了一大帝國；只是不幸的，却因着獨立戰爭而把它失掉了；不過其一部分－－加拿大，至今還是保存着。印度是法國人先下手的，並且首先發明了怎樣以取印度的方法。這方法是：第一，印度的軍隊到底不是歐洲軍隊的敵手：第二，若是訓練印度的車隊，其結果就可以拿印度來征服印度。然而英國人却把道方法完全剿　過來，用以征服了印度，並且把法蘭西人從印度驅逐出去。父澳洲從來是稱爲新荷蘭的，英國也從荷蘭人的手裏奪得：最後把南非洲也從荷蘭人的手裏搶了過去。所謂南非聯邦，實在是成立於英國女皇維多利亞晚年以至愛德華七世時候的。這樣澈底於海盜根性的英國人，逢着一切機會而發揮其根性，有時且自作其機會，終於快要把世界的角角落落，恰如蠶食桑葉一般，噬食而盡。</p>
<p>然而樂極生悲，英國在維多利亞時代以至愛德華七世時代，巳開始敗落，至喬治五世時代，更急轉而直下了。關於英國的衰亡，在其最盛時代的維多利亞時代，早巳有把它來作暗示的人，還有把它來作諷諭的人。所謂「疲乏了的泰坦（Titan）——神話中的巨人」，一衰老的猛獅」等話，漸漸成爲英國的代名詞了。</p>
<p>在那樣極少數的英國有識者中，竟也有對於將來深抱不安的人。有一個叫做却爾斯，披阿遜（CharlesPierson）的英國人，於一八九三年一月，著了一本書，題名「國民的生活及品性，」替白種人洩露了極爲悲觀的預測。這裏所稱的白種人，從其內容看來，分明是指英美的盎格魯撒克遜人。我讀了那本書，看到這個比羅馬帝國三個還要大的世界大帝國，已在開始其自潰作用的徵象，不由地認出我大東亞回復的曙光而不勝其愉快。該書當時曾由本社（每日新聞社）抄譯，以「白種人之前途」爲題，把它出版，在明治中期的靑年中，至今當還有記憶着的人吧。</p>
<p>又在日本戰勝俄國的翌年即一九〇六年，英國牛津的「阿定」社，曾出版了一本「英國衰亡史」，該書係假托西曆二〇〇五年在日本東京刋行，記述十年前（即一九九五年）亡掉的英國的歷史，爲日本小學校採用作敎科書者。其著作人的筆名呌做維維安。格雷，木名爲挨利俄特。E．米爾斯。總之，該書的趣意，無非是英國人假托日本小學校的敎科書，以使其自國的國民，知道自國的衰亡而巳。</p>
<p>該書所舉的衰亡理由凡九條：第一，都會生活壓迫農村生活，貽害英國民的健康和信念。第二，二十世紀的英國民巳只知調養之地外，不復顧到海洋。第三，變成極度的機弱和奢侈。第四，文學和演劇趣味的趨於頹廢。第五，英國民的體格和健康漸决衰弱。第六，在英國民之間，知識的道德的生活衰敗。第七，租稅苛徵無厭，市政費濫用無度。第八，敎育的虛偽橫行於英國。第九，英國民的自衛力和國防力日趨無力化。（據木村莊太郞氏譯本）</p>
<p>又在最近，尙有一九四〇年出版的「大英帝國的衰亡史」一書。此書的著者爲羅巴特·布利福特·由辛克萊·西德維契氏摘錄並作序及加按評，叙述相當辛辣，亦相當痛快。我們現在只舉出它的書名，姑目避開述說其內容之煩吧。總之，所謂英國的衰亡，在最近五十年間，正在逐日地濃厚起來，一抹的哀愁，猶如夢魔，自然而然地把大英帝國掩罩住了唱。</p>
<p>可不知英國對於這個情勢巳經自覺了呢，還是已把它點認了呢？總而言之，在英國女皇中年以後，已揭藥所謂帝國全義這件寳貨，而試爲輸血之法。當時的首相狄斯瑞利把印度皇帝的皇冠强加於英國女皇頭上，也就是那個方法。西利，洛茲柏立（Resebery）狄爾克（Dilke）等的　論，以至的瑟·張伯倫（Joseph　Chamberlain）的帝國主義，是其最顯著的，而以文學者的身份而爲喇叭手的，實在就是吉百林（RudyardKipling）其人。</p>
<p>然而此等特意的輸血法，却沒有像那些人們所想望着的效能，母寗到頭還是促進了英國的衰亡。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰，實使英國處於生死存亡的十字街頭。表面看來，英國在這個戰爭是獲得勝利了，德國是敗北了。如果英國能够善用這個勝利，講求自新之道，則英國靠着這個機會，也許已能再生復活。那知她却誤用了這個勝利，竟把嗣後的二十年，苟且偷安過去，終於臨到了今日的狀態。反之，德國則恰如一個傷寒病患者的復元，已把身體的組織改變一新，得慶更生復活了。而英國和德國的關係，巳把二十年前的地位，在二十年後的今日，完全顚倒過來。</p>
<p>英國嘗於一八九六年時，依着「德國製造品」（Madein　German）書，在倫敦街上任何店面·無不使人覺醒於件件成了德國製品的事實，大使舊習一新，講求如何可以歸於能率主義。如洛茲柏立者，卽爲其主要的一人。然而那情形也就至此而巳，終於第一决世界大戰過去了。嗣後對於德國的狀態差不多毫無關心。對此而提出警吿過的，除今日的首相邱吉爾外，不過極少數的幾個人。</p>
<p>因此，到了今日，早已弄得無計可施了。然而進一步考之，英國之所以臨到今日的狀態，不能不說是積惡所致。英國實是徹底於海盜主義的；其繁熒發達，以至造成世界規模的大帝國，是由於海盜主義，又其逐漸趨於崩潰，也是由於海盜主義。諺云：「逆取順守，」然而英國却是徹頭徹尾地逆取逆守的。英國甚至連近在手邊的愛爾蘭，尙且不能收爲羽翼，何况對於將近四萬萬的印度人呢？然而翻過來想，英國的敵人，倒不是日本，也不是德國，意大利，法蘭西，當然也不是蘇聯，英國的敵人正是其殖民地加拿大，澳洲·而最大的便是印度。</p>
<p>不過他們對於英國，現在尙還忍受着，而今日正要把英國一口吞下去，而且已經吞到一半的，便是那個靑出於藍的美國。然而使得美國對英國逞其虎狼之心的，實在就是英国自己。現在英國正向着所謂自作自受，自亡自滅的境域，日日前進。如果不把道稱之爲悲劇，則人類的歷史什麼才是悲劇呢？而且其悲劇完全是同族相殘的悲劇。海盜之子和海盜之子互相爭奪贓物，終至彼此互噬，實是悲劇的極致。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>小工業貸款銀團</h3>
<p>今後金融界的正常業務，厥爲扶植生產，而扶植生產的主要工具，即爲貸款銀團。最近兩個星期裏面，農業貸款和工業貸款的消息，傳播得十分熱閙，這可以顯示余融界今後放款方向與對　的轉變：新的方向與對象是：抉助正當生產，安定民衆生活。</p>
<p>最近，一部份財界人士，鑒於手工業與小工業在中國工業發展的階段中所占地位，積極主張組織」小工業貸款銀團』，並且對於放款用途，放款金額，放款担保，放款利息，與放款辦法，特別提示具體的意見。無疑地，這是改善金融活動與增加生產力量的一個良法美意。</p>
<p>說到這一個問題，本欄曾在三月二日發表過一篇「小型工廠的生產問題」，其中有過這樣幾句話：「中國是個農業經濟形態的國家，工業發展，還很幼稚；從生產力上購，手工到機械生產，還正在蛻化過程中，因之，小型工業在整個生產量上，還佔着重要的地位；……很多銀行錢莊，並不把這些小型工廠，當作放款對象，儘管輿論主張多多向工業貸軟，但在實際上，還多保持着求者却之，却者供之的方針；這一方針，不知傷害了多少生產機構的長成」。</p>
<p>如今，這樣一個不合理的方針是轉變了。我們進一步的期望是；對於放款辦法一點，認爲除了隨時調查各工廠的生產狀况，以及貸款是否使用於不正當的用途而外，並須不斷的予以技術上的指導；假定明知貸款是使用於正當用途，可是在貸款以後，仍祇兢兢於放款担保與放款利息一類問題，而對於小型工業的管理與指導，則一切置諸不聞不問，那麽，扶植生產的意義，祇怕還不能够十二分的實澈。所以，我們特地提出，藉供「小工業貸款銀團』的考量。</p>

<h3>虛飾</h3>
<p>— 枕琱戈</p>
<p>人有一個通病，　是虛飾。</p>
<p>靑年學生交結了一個異性朋友，儘管他和她私底下妹妹啊愛啊情啊；　可是你若是勸他們：「讀書的時候，最好不談戀愛。」於是他們像煞受寃被屈地說：誰在談戀愛，我們不過是普通的朋友罷了」；說不定還會說你是「十八世紀的餘孽」。結婚了，即使在××飯店，××舞廳行禮，設筵，揮金如土，但他們底啟事，還是「時値非常一切從簡」。父母死了，兄弟們，說不定爲了遺產，鬧得落花流水，但是訃聞上仍是「不孝等罪孽深重」「親視含殮」，於是乎，還要「孤　子×××泣血　顙。」</p>
<p>諸如此類太多了，不勝枚舉。考其原因，乃是他們一面要維持表面上的「名」，一面要滿足自己底「利」與「慾」，「二者不可得兼」，於是乎虛飾就「不得已也」地興起了。</p>
<p>爲了虛飾，我們不知受了多少創；目己浚有力氣，而要硬說是大力士，自己沒有錢，更要充着闊佬：他們無不是打腫了臉充胖子！可是朋友，打腫了臉或許可以充胖子，但是明　　瘡的苦痛，仍是你底！今日的虛飾，明日被拆穿該怎樣啊？</p>
<p>虛飾而被拆穿，結果比沒有虛飾如何？</p>
<h3>上海雜记（二）</h3>
<p>— 橋本關雪</p>
<p>上海美術學校校長劉海粟，及曾幾度赴日的王濟　因事變而遠赴現在的昭南，尙未歸來。仙們二人都是洋畫家。</p>
<p>劉海粟旣有膽力亦富經當之才，尤爲我所信服。在中日文化提携上，他是很出力的。有一次我對他談起這問題，微求他的意見。當時上海美術學校的有洋畫系的學生三百人，學習洋畫　學生大多爲資產階級與貧苦階級的子　，沒有中產階級。貧困階級中有抱共產主義思想者，我對他說：「還是解散罷！你以爲怎樣？」他搖搖頭，說解散似嫌過早，不如叫不良分子退　。「甚麽！假使放逐，更麻煩，將從外部有所舉國勳，」我說。他說招集三百個學生要不了十天工夫，可是他終於因此而赴巴黎留學去了。到了巴黎之後，曾接到他二三次信，此後就沒有會面過。他到昭南去的時候，我曾想，假使知道他們住處，能够找到而大家會面多好。東京美術學校出身的兪寄凡和江小鶼，他們的日本話很流利，在南京政府服務。江君是雕刻家，事變後聽說已死了，中國現在新的雕刻家很少，所以江君之死，實很可惜。在西湖或別的地方還殘留着他的作品。</p>
<p>數年的，曾在本報元旦特刊上草一文，題曰：「東洋繪畫的精神與戰爭畫，」文內說：米南宮是西部亞細亞人，信奉回敎者，日本的學者都這樣肯定着。甚至於說蘇東坡是移流民族　雜　，三國史上大家都熟悉的關羽和張飛等，從其風采容貌而言，亦許是移沭民族的人。尤其如關羽，像日本的天滿宮那樣，在中國到處被供奉祭祀着。如其研究起來，或許有意外而有興味的新發見。在理時的中國十　年前有人曾說李太白不是中國人，是移流民族，是十耳其人，並且有許多人費　當的工夫來硏究這件　。</p>
<p>舉例來看，太白集中一寄遠一一詩說：「魯槁如玉霜，筆題月氐　，」並有一西海慰離居。曾因行數多，字字有委曲」等句。從月氐書，西海等字眼而言，可知　知　外國的文字。又如大馬歌」中，「天馬來自月支窟，」一語。天馬歌是他老年棄官後自擬於天馬所作之詩，言外炎煮，暗示他少年時係從外國移流而來。魏　形容他的容貌說：「眸子耿然，哆如餓虎』，崔宗之詩說他「雙眸光照人』。更舉他少年時歡喜習武，好决鬥之例爲證，曾任唐朝像現代外交部長這樣的要職，採用所謂以夷制夷的手段。（翔：譯自四月廿二日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>點滴與滙合</h3>
<p>— 獄徒</p>
<p>報端常有一些「名言摘錄」，或是「修養語錄」，我們就叫它爲「點滴」，當然的，在每句中都有至理存在，吿訴我們做人的「方針」，但這些所謂一點滴」，我們如果只能做到一滴或二滴，這對於整個人生是度沒有什麽成就可言的，所以我們就必須把這些零碎的「點滴」「滙合」起來不可，小而言之人生修養須如此，大而言之，事業上的成功也何嘗不是如此呢？</p>
<p>譬如自來水龍頭上出來一滴滴的水吧，如果能永恒的向一點滴去，則日久之後，即使是水門汀的也會被滴成一個凹進去的小洞吧！是的，這就是點滴的力量，但這力量是靠了能匯合在一點上，如果一滴一滴的水，東灑一滴，西飄一滴，則水門汀永還了不會給它滴成　個洞的，即使是傾盆大雨也不可能動水門汀的分毫吧！</p>
<p>由此我們便可以知道點滴的力量是可驚人的，但必須滙合，「有計　」，「有目的」滙合起來，平日不單是只注意禮貌的悅人，而要處處地方注意學習做人。事業則不單是只解決幾個困難便算數，而須有計劃有目的地貫穿連繫起來，有統一的考慮與佈置，滙合全部力量來應付，不損失任何一小滴微渺的力量，這樣做去，成功的希望當可以實現了。</p>
<p>點滴要滙合是不容易的，和水的每一滴滙合一點一樣困難，因爲有空氣的阻力和風的吹壓，難免不東飄西蕩了，因此點滴的本身正須堅强有力，要重而急，要有固定方向，要有恒心，向正確的目標不斷地滴去，你能說它的力量不偉大嗎？</p>
<h3>關於維他命　B1之毒性反應</h3>
<p>— 庸</p>
<p>最近醫藥界發現，維他命B1注射於某種病人身上發現反應之現象。此種反應，國外醫藥界亦曾數度發現。</p>
<p>維他命B1自被發現對於吾人健康有極重要之關係後，應用於治療中日見頻繁。維他命B1　之劑量向無一定，但一般均信甚毫　毒性，故應　時爲求其迅　見效，大都以超過日常需要數倍甚至數十倍之量供給病人，結果亦無顯著的功效和顯著的不良影響可見。最近美國Oineiooate醫學院之C．A．Mills敎投，發見一每日服維他命Bi10mg．之婦人，在　星期半之間，連續發生頭痛，失眠，敏感，脈搏速增，衰弱，顫抖等與甲狀腺素服用過量之毒性作用　似之反應，此種反應於停服維他命B1後二日內即完全消失病人經一星期之休息後，再度進服維他命B1　劑量　至5mg．然於四星期後，相同之毒性反應又復發生，停服後又吿消失。</p>
<p>Mills敎授復在巴拿馬之熱帶區域，觀察維他命B1之毒性反應。人體處於炎熱之環境中，所　維他命B1之量較多於在溫帶區域，外人旅居是地者，極易發生維他命缺乏症。醫師遇有此種病人，必施用特高劑量（20-40mg．）之維他命B1。於是毒性反應之發生亦就數見不鮮，且情形類皆相同，停服後此種反應亦均消失。故此種反應或於病人服用或注射維他命B1劑過量而起。</p>
<p>維他命B1之毒性反應與他種維他命之缺乏亦有關係。加里福尼亞大學敎授Morgan氏，曾於動物身上作一試騐，見凡缺乏B族維他命中之多種者，若僅補充以一二種，結果往往有損無益。蓋因維他命B族中，現至少包括十二種營養要素，故缺乏之情形極爲複雜，僅就B1一種加以補救，時常無濟於事。故此種毒性反應，亦可謂由於不平衡之作用而起。現本埠醫藥界正盡力硏究其詳細原因，想不日當可公佈。</p>
<h3>遠近法</h3>
<p>— 張心</p>
<p>繪畫有遠近的看支，簡　遠近法；人生道上，也有遠近的看法：</p>
<p>在人生道上，遠處看似渺小，近處看似龐大，可是，遠處指示我們以方向，也是教們要到達的目的地，我們要　進，目光就不得不時時落在遠處，否則，一味貪看路旁的野花，留戀面前的美景，置遠處於不顧，勢必迷失了前路的方向，或忘記了奔程的任務，結果，是誤入歧途，或裏足不前了，井底的蛙，因爲偷安在狹窄的圈子裏，看不到遠處，見識也就幼稚得可憐，所以如果不注意遠處，便是人生道上的落伍者。</p>
<p>至於近處，也不可忽略，因爲近處雖有坦途，也有棘叢，亦有壕溝；有時要面臨深淵，有時得足履薄冰，對於棘叢，要排除牠，對於壕溝，要跨越牠，對於深淵和薄冰，更須加倍小心，然後能前進不息，安全抵達目的地，否則，兩眼一味釘住遠　的星光，置近處於不顧，我們早就爲棘叢所絆倒，於是陷入壕溝，或墮入深淵或跌落冰下。安能抵達星光指示之處？所以如果不留心近處也是人生道上的落伍者。</p>
<p>在繪畫上，要遠近兼顧，才是高明的畫手，在人生道上，要遠近兼顧，才是高明的旅人。</p>
<h3>一條真理</h3>

<h3>關於賭塲</h3>
<p>— 沈鐘</p>
<p>假使有人說設立賭塲是可以復興市面的話，則一切有關風化的色情秘戲之類，可以名之爲「性敎育」了，所以，不客氣的說，講這句話的人，除非是失去了頭腦，否則便是「別有用心」。</p>
<p>爲了「賭塲」，使報紙上社會新聞裏增加了不少的「資料」，捲逃，舞弊，侵佔，搶刦，自殺，……等等。所以有人說「賭塲」是「毀人爐」。</p>
<p>我們雖然說賭徒是自己在「送死，」然而站在「旁觀者淸」的我們，何忍坐視這一批批的「同類」去「送死」。、</p>
<p>今日的執政當局，旣然處處在關懷着民生，國積，投機，果然要查辦，特別治罪。而賭塲則更需要查禁特別治罪。好在當局已經嚴正痛切表示。</p>

<h3>Unfolding the Scientific Movement</h3>
<p>Science is a sharp weapon for the progress of human civilization. Countries with advanced science are bound to be prosperous and strong; conversely, countries with backward science will inevitably remain poor and weak. Especially in the current warring nations, there are highly developed science and technology. From war institutions to production lines, all are based on scientific methods and utilize scientific achievements to compete with each other and establish the nation in a safe domain. Therefore, some say that modern warfare is a war of science, which is by no means unfounded.</p>
<p>Taking some obvious examples in this World War, countries with scientific progress are certain to grasp the victory of the war. As pointed out by Japanese Army Affairs Bureau Chief Sato in his speech at the Army Technology Research Association on April 14: "In the North African war last summer," the German and Italian armies conquered the fortress of Tobruk overnight, drove straight into Egypt, and Alexandria was in sight. The great success of this campaign was due to the German army's invention of war weapons and the new improvement of the air-conditioning device in tanks. The reason why the Red Army's winter offensive this winter had unexpected power was due to the Red Army's war equipment and the preparation of anti-tank weapons, and the thorough training in the use of these mechanized units, which were powerful main reasons. "Similarly, Japan's victory in the Pacific, in addition to the combat spirit of the soldiers and the strategic superiority of the generals, is also attributed to the result of Japan's decades of dedicated research and development of science.</p>
<p>This newspaper has published the achievements of Japanese scientific research for several days in a row. From here, we can see the strength of a country and its invincibility in combat, causing the British and Americans, who have always boasted of being the world's most powerful industrial countries, to repeatedly lose, which is by no means a fluke. However, the development of Japan's heavy industry sector was originally relatively backward, so production science can undoubtedly be said to be quite slow. It was only since the war, especially recently, that there has been an astonishing leap, but Japanese authorities and scientists still do not consider it sufficient and are still working hard to research greater achievements in order to seek to surpass Britain and the United States in both quality and quantity and establish the necessary state of a scientific war.</p>
<p>China in modern times is a country with backward culture and a naive industry. Although the scientific movement began during the Reform Movement of 1898, due to years of natural and man-made disasters, both internal and external troubles, the government has no time to advocate scientific undertakings, and people with lofty ideals have no way to study with peace of mind. Compared with the scientific progress of the world powers, it is impossible not to sigh with admiration. Today's era is no longer the ancient times of "working at sunrise, resting at sunset, hearing the sounds of chickens and dogs, and people not visiting each other until old age and death." The metaphysical philosophy of the ancient sages and the so-called "spiritual strategy" can never be applied to the current environment and save our country and nation. More positively, we have now declared war on scientifically developed countries such as Britain and the United States. Considering our current backward scientific situation, we should catch up quickly and launch a scientific movement as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In order to launch a scientific movement, we first hope that the government authorities will take the fact that Japan has caught up with Britain and the United States in a short period of time as a basis, accept the experience of the arduous struggle of the Japanese scientific community, and establish a national policy for developing the scientific movement. First, the central and local governments should designate a considerable amount of funds, on the one hand, to improve the subjects of universities and specialized schools and increase the hours of scientific research; on the other hand, to encourage all scientific inventions and research by the people and provide material assistance to those who are committed to science.</p>
<p>Secondly, we hope that the public and private scientific research institutions that have been established should be unified and linked in a planned way under the guidance of the government to complete the wartime scientific mobilization system. At the same time, we should jointly seek close connection and coordination between science and technology and industry, eliminate all estrangement and contradictions between each other, and enable science and technology to exert their greatest functions in increasing production.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we hope even more that, as Japanese public opinion hopes, we will establish a reward system for diligent labor and invention and give spiritual preferential treatment to scientific and technical personnel. Japan has long had rules such as the "Technical Achievement Medal" and the "Diligent Labor Achievement Medal." Germany also has a method of awarding the "Medal of Honor" to scientific inventors. At a time when China lacks scientific talents, this kind of superior reward is even more indispensable.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope even more that the Japanese scientific and technological community will provide great assistance to the development of China's scientific movement, especially in the cultivation of talents and the guidance of technology. Recently, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo said that the current war is a "daily competition of science and science, technology and technology" (quoted from the editorial of the Japanese Asahi Shimbun on April 16). We deeply hope that the authorities and scientists will know how to strive!</p>

<h3>The Capital Commemorates Youth Day Chairman Wang Attends and Delivers an Address Understanding the Spirit of the New National Movement Striving to Revitalize China and Defend East Asia</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - Today is the first Youth Day of the New China. According to this Youth Day, it was stipulated by the National Father Sun Yat-sen on the day he took office as President in Guangdong. The Propaganda Department, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Welfare, and the Nanjing Special Municipal Government jointly organized the first Youth Day Sports Meeting for the sake of celebration. Starting at 9:00 a.m. today, it was grandly held at the gymnasium of the National Central University. Five hundred male and female students from large, medium, and small schools in Nanjing participated as representatives of the youth league athletes. At the opening ceremony, Chairman Wang, wearing the marshal's dress, personally delivered a speech. The speech stated that on the occasion of Youth Day, students across the country should not only understand the spirit of the New National Movement, but also achieve the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia with a lively spirit and a healthy body. The words were earnest, and all listeners were moved. After the speech, various sports competitions began, all of which were very exciting and fully demonstrated the vitality of the youth under the New China's war.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Capital Youth and Adolescents' Sports Meeting to celebrate Youth Day continued the competition events held on the 4th, starting at 9:00 a.m. on the 5th.

At 5:00 p.m., all the competitions and performances were completed, and the results were very good.</p>
<h3>Ye Peng Speaks in Japan Elaborating on the Impressions of the Inspection Japanese Soldiers are of Excellent Quality and Military Equipment is Sophisticated China's Military Building Must be Assisted by Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - After arriving in Tokyo on April 27, the Chinese Military Inspection Group to Japan inspected various aspects of the Japanese Army in order to contribute to China's military building work. The head of the delegation, General Ye Peng, Minister of the Army of the National Government, and the deputy head of the delegation, Sun Liangcheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Second Front Army, Lieutenant General Xiang Zhizhuang, Chief of Staff of the Military Commission, and Lieutenant General Shao Wenkai, Commander of the Gendarmerie of the North China Pacification Army, and other senior Chinese army generals, spoke on the 3rd at the Imperial Hotel here about their impressions of this visit to Japan and the warm belief in Sino-Japanese cooperation after the completion of military building in the future. General Ye Peng, head of the delegation, said: "When participating in the Tencho-setsu (Emperor's Birthday) parade on April 29, the most admirable thing was the perfection of the mechanized equipment of the Japanese Army and the excellence of the soldiers' skills. The exercise of the Japanese Air Force in the sky over the parade ground on that day was especially admirable. I firmly believe that the Japanese Army is the most excellent army in the world, which is due to the unique spirit of the Japanese soldiers understanding the center of the imperial family, and at the same time, they have received strict education and training, so they have today's achievements. Secondly, with regard to military production, judging only from the factories I saw in a short time, for example, the tanks made with Japan's unique technology are superior to those made in Germany. I now recognize that this is also a manifestation of the Japanese national spirit. The Chinese army is currently only cooperating with the Japanese army in restoring治安 (public order), and in the future, it should improve education, improve quality, cultivate strength, and engage in the Greater East Asia War, and establish an army like the Japanese army. This is the unanimous and ardent hope of the Chinese army cadres. However, modern equipment cannot be started without Japan's close assistance. Recently, the decline in the strength of the anti-Japanese war in Chongqing is a very obvious fact. The reason for this is nothing more than that Japan respects China's independent and autonomous stand and provides sincere assistance, so the Yu (Chongqing) side has lost the significance of the anti-Japanese war. Japan has continued to fight for six years, and its national strength has become more and more abundant, and after directly fighting with Britain and the United States, it has re-secured an immovable strategic advantage in East Asia. Chongqing's blood transfusion route has been blocked, and only the Northwest Highway remains. Because the United States' assistance is useless, it is also impossible to continue the anti-Japanese war independently. It is natural for the people under Chongqing's rule to realize that Britain is not reliable and that the anti-Japanese war is useless. After China participated in the war, the country gradually decided to unite, and all hoped to cooperate with friendly Japan to jointly build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army in Central Hebei Expands its Battle Results The Longhai Railway Also Achieves Victory</h3>
<p>Beijing, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the front line of the Japanese Army in Central Hebei on the 5th, after the Japanese Army surrounded the dispersed Yu (Chongqing) Army in Central Hebei, it cut off their mutual contact and implemented individual annihilation. Since the 3rd, the battle results have become greater and greater, and the Yu Army there is about to be completely annihilated. At dawn on the 3rd, the Japanese Army first defeated the Yu Army near the north of Ding County and destroyed its grain and grass warehouse, and is now continuing to mop up. In addition, a certain unit of the Japanese Army cleared the Yu Army in the east of the division and continued to pursue them, and intercepted a large batch of white rice hidden by the Yu Army on the way, and threatened its transportation line. Another unit of the Japanese Army, when searching the Tonglong Mountain in the west of the division and the caves behind the northern mountain, found two mortars, six rifles, landmines, bedding, and other military supplies abandoned by the Yu Army. On the 4th, they attacked the remnants of the Yu Army in the mountains southeast of Chicheng in the northwest of Tang County and defeated them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Xuzhou, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army recently launched a fierce attack on 2,000 people of Li Xianzhu's 93rd Army of the Yu Army near 25 kilometers southeast of Dangshan on the Longhai Railway and is continuing to expand the battle results. As a result of the battles on the 3rd and 4th, 552 Yu Army corpses were left behind, 48 people were captured, and the Japanese Army intercepted 4 mortars, 1 heavy machine gun, 3,250 rounds of bullets, 196 rifles, 1,500 rounds of rifle bullets, 43 bayonets, 460 hand grenades, and landmines.</p>

<h3>Japanese Dispatch Army Studies the Prevalence of Kala-Azar</h3>
<p>Beijing, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese China Dispatch Army troops often study various medical buildings during the spare time of combat in order to eradicate infectious diseases prevalent in China. For example, recently, preventive medicines for eradicating kala-azar and preventing dysentery and cholera bacteria have been discovered, which have greatly benefited the Chinese people. Among them, kala-azar is a unique endemic disease in northern China, which has spread to various places along the Yellow River for many years and has caused great harm. The Japanese Army's rural troops, in order to eradicate this evil epidemic, began to study it two and a half years ago, went to various parts of northern China to conduct field surveys, and visited hospitals in 13 countries including China, Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Belgium, and Switzerland, and carefully investigated its source. After a year and a half, they finally reached a conclusion that the most rampant areas of kala-azar are Xuzhou, Huai'an, and Haizhou in the north of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. After the middle of the 19th century, a major epidemic was brewed near Suining, Lingxian, and Sixian, and the current state of its spread was detected, dividing it into four routes: one went north along the Jinpu Railway to Jinan and then east along the Jiaoji Railway; from near Haizhou via sea to Zhifu and Weihaiwei; three went north along the Pinghan Railway to Beijing; and four spread to Xi'an along the Longhai Railway. In addition, the infection period of kala-azar is mostly between May and July, and it occurs in August and September in plains with lower sea levels and is prevalent in rural areas with limestone alluvial strata and more stagnant water lakes and marshes. In addition, the results of another Japanese Army unit's research on cholera bacteria in mainland China confirmed that this bacterium came from overseas and was spread from southern China and Southeast Asia. It is firmly believed that the immune efficacy of using epidemic bacteria as a preventive cholera inoculation vaccine can be said to be the greatest.</p>

<h3>Li Shiqun Talks about the Qingxiang Problem in Guangdong The Implementation Date Has Not Yet Been Decided Preparations Have Already Begun</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - Li Shiqun, Secretary-General of the Qingxiang Committee, was ordered to go to Guangdong some time ago to guide the Guangdong Province in preparing for the Qingxiang affairs, and flew back to the capital on the 2nd. The reporter specially visited Mr. Li at his official residence on the morning of the 5th, and was given the following speech: "I was ordered by the Chairman and concurrently the Chairman of the Committee to go to Guangdong to discuss the preparations for the Qingxiang affairs, and I started my journey on the 29th of last month. According to my previous position as the Minister of Police Affairs, I went to Guangdong to inspect the police affairs of Guangdong Province. Now, I am revisiting the old place, although only a few days have passed, the progress of the government of Guangdong Province, taking Guangzhou City as an example, has a population of more than 720,000, which shows that the治安 (public order) is solid, the economy is prosperous, and there is a leap in education. The precision and rigor of the organization and training of youth and adolescents is the crown of the country, which is probably due to the leadership of Governor Chen and the efforts of the authorities. As for the Qingxiang affairs in Guangdong Province, Governor Chen will be the center, and it will be vigorously launched under the leadership of the Qingxiang Committee. I arrived in Guangdong on the 29th and convened a Qingxiang symposium on the 30th to jointly discuss the progress. Governor Chen and the local liaison minister of friendly countries attended the meeting and discussed it. As a result of the agreement, the opinions were extremely consistent, so after returning to Beijing, I have already reported to the Chairman and asked for instructions. At present, there are roughly two major problems in the Guangdong Qingxiang: (1) the preparatory work for manpower, such as the training of party, government, military, police, blockade, and propaganda personnel; (2) the financial problem. In view of the current situation in Guangdong Province, if it is to bear the Qingxiang expenses alone, it may feel difficult, and the central government is slightly richer in subsidies. The formal start date of the Qingxiang has not yet been determined, but the preparations have already begun. In the future, the situation will be considered, or the precedents of Qingxiang in various places will be followed. The Guangdong Provincial Branch of the Committee should be concurrently held by Governor Chen in order to achieve the integration of the party, government, military, and police. Once the Qingxiang work begins, we will see the strengthening of the治安 (public order) and the improvement of people's livelihood, which will not only expand the political power of Guangdong Province, but also expand the political power of the National Government.』</p>

<h3>German Newspaper Comments on Major General Tanihagi's Speech Saying Japan Will Launch Another Major Offensive</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Deutsche Volkszeitung here published on the 4th a message and commentary on the speech by Major General Tanihagi, Chief of the Army Press Department, in Nagoya on April 30 regarding the current situation of the Greater East Asia War, predicting that the Japanese army will launch another large-scale offensive. The message said that the Japanese army today is much stronger than it was at the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. As Major General Tanihagi said, the Japanese army is ready to launch a large-scale new offensive at any time and anywhere. In the four months after the start of the war, the Japanese army obtained an infinite amount of stored resources and obtained a position sufficient to continue the war independently. The Japanese navy has increased eightfold compared to the start of the war. If the British and American armies think that the Japanese army is standing idly by while confronting the German army in the European theater, they will suffer the consequences. Regarding this point, Major General Tanihagi said that Japan must carry out preparatory slogans in order to launch a large-scale offensive, which has a profound meaning. Although the military experts of the anti-Axis powers have not predicted when the Japanese army will launch the offensive, they are in complete agreement that the Japanese army's wait-and-see attitude in the Pacific will soon end.</p>
<h3>Japan's National Savings are Stimulated</h3>

<h3>After the Great Defeat in the Air Battle of Darwin, Australians Were Extremely Frustrated. Japanese Air Force's Long-Range Intense Bombing May Be a Prelude to an Offensive Against Australia</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) – Following the Japanese air force's air raid on Darwin Port on the 2nd, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command only announced that the losses in the air battle were very heavy. In addition, no accurate figures were released, which suggests that the Japanese air force's attack this time seems to have dealt a significant blow to Australia. Australian military headquarters authorities stated on the 4th that the Japanese military may continue to bomb Australia in the future to scout out Australian military strength. It can be seen from this battle that the Japanese air force does have the strength to carry out long-range large-scale bombings. At the same time, there is much discussion in Australia, and the fact that the British-made Spitfire fighters, which are touted by the anti-Axis camp as the best in the world, did not exert their power in this air battle has become a point of silent criticism. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation even had a humorous broadcast saying, "The reason why the Spitfire squadrons suffered such great losses was due to the bad weather. The Spitfire squadrons were forced to fly over the distant ocean as a result of the air battle with enemy aircraft. When they returned after the end of the air battle, they encountered headwinds on the way, so many accidents occurred. Previously, we believed that the Spitfire pilots could deal with the Japanese air force, so if they were on an equal footing, they would not be defeated. Therefore, our previous confidence has no reason to be frustrated." In addition, the anti-Axis command also stated, "The losses were extremely large due to the bad weather." A British correspondent also said that some pilots who were shot down in combat with the Japanese air force survived by using parachutes. However, this is not enough to give Australians comfort.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Gedde, the former Associated Press correspondent in Hong Kong, sent a message today from an air force base in northwestern Australia, saying that the air raid on Darwin Port on Sunday showed the Japanese air force's ability to carry out long-range intense bombing, which may be a prelude to an offensive against Australia. Australian aviation experts believe that the main purpose of the Japanese air raid this time was to test the anti-Axis air defense forces. According to reports received here, it is unanimously stated that the Japanese are now strengthening existing airfields and building new ones to enhance their position. This bombing has shown that the Japanese air force can launch powerful attacks from remote bases. Spitfire fighters stationed at Darwin Port took off on Sunday to intercept Japanese aircraft, but suffered considerable losses while fighting in the Arafura Sea near the port. The Australian communiqué has acknowledged this fact.</p>
<h3>New Weapon in Japanese Wartime Science</h3>
<p>A New Method of Hangar Construction: "Of course, because the basic research does not yet have sufficient confidence, we will continue to work hard in the future." This is the statement of Mr. Kaoru Takayama, a construction technology captain of the Army Aviation Headquarters.</p>
<p>Captain Takayama has completed a method of creating large buildings by joining wood together using only nails. Large hangars with a span of forty-two meters can be built very strongly without using steel materials, and the construction time is greatly shortened. This is truly a major revolution in wooden construction in the future. It can be seen in the state of craftsmen building houses that the connection of wood to wood is to build the skeleton of a spliced building. There are various complex mortise and tenon joints connected together, and if you want to build a large building, you need various steel materials such as iron bolts and iron pins to tighten the joints. When building the skeleton, nails are not used at all. Nails are only used when installing the ridge beam. This is the standard way of wooden construction. Manufacturing mortise and tenon joints in wood takes a long time, and using iron bolts requires a lot of steel materials. Nailing it together is very economical and quick.</p>
<p>Captain Takayama, in the spring of the year following the outbreak of the China Incident, namely Showa 13 (1938), devoted himself to the study of nails during his spare time for half a year. As a result, it became possible to build large buildings using so-called "three-inch nails" that are four inches long, and it also became possible to build hangars in a short period of time. From the perspective of construction conventions, this is an extremely dangerous method, and those involved are very worried, so no one asks for advice. If this method can be realized, then the iron bones used in hangars before can be saved to make cannons, tanks, and bullets. No matter what, it must be realized, so there is the above-mentioned "continue to work hard" statement. His enthusiasm finally moved the hearts of those involved, and construction began in the autumn of Showa 13 (1938).</p>
<p>Even using steel bones, it is not easy to build a skeleton with a span of forty meters. If wood is only joined together with nails, then during the construction process, there is always the worry that it may collapse. This is why most people are not at ease. Captain Takayama was full of confidence and urged the construction of a huge skeleton according to his instructions. In March of the following year, Showa 14 (1939), he completed a magnificent large hangar. People's surprise naturally changed. Since its beginning, after four years, Japan's first large building nailed together with nails has been completed. At the same time, this method continues to be used to build barracks, lecture halls, etc., and it has been very successfully done. In the army, forty such buildings have been built, saving 8,500 tons of steel and reducing costs by 1.5 million yen, while the construction time only accounts for 70% of the previous time. Therefore, it has made a great contribution to the future of wooden construction.</p>
<p>"An ordinary sixteen-millimeter iron bolt can be made into thirty-five four-inch nails. And the endurance of this iron bolt is only within ten nails. This cannot be said to be a special discovery or invention, but simply re-studying and utilizing nails that have not been fully utilized. Using Japanese pine and cedar wood for construction actually shows that nails are already enough. After using this method, there is no need to carve mortise and tenon joints in the wood anymore, and there is no need for other difficult techniques. Houses can also be built very simply. In the field of technology, there is generally a conservative tendency. Many people think that my method is very dangerous. After four years of research, we finally completed the construction of a large hangar. The academic community has also begun to pay attention to the study of nails since this spring, and the private sector will be able to implement it soon!"</p>
<p>In Showa 10 (1935), Captain Takayama graduated from the Department of Architecture at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Tokyo. After graduating, he continued his research, believing that he could make the impossible possible. This points out a great path of "wartime research" for all scientists engaged in research.

<h3>Western Tunisian Front: British and Algerian New Offensives Repelled; Tunisian Border Warfare Enters a New Stage After the Axis Forces Retreat from Mateur</h3>
<p>Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) The Italian military headquarters issued a war report today as follows: (1) On the western Tunisian front, the Anti-Axis forces, in cooperation with artillery and tank forces, launched a new offensive, but were repelled by the Axis forces. The Third Unit of the 27th Infantry Regiment of the Italian Army fought the most bravely in this campaign. (2) German fighter squadrons shot down three enemy aircraft in aerial combat. (3) Axis bomber squadrons repeatedly bombed the port facilities of the Anti-Axis forces in Bône. (4) Anti-Axis bomber squadrons attacked the Taranto and Reggio areas of the Italian mainland, with minimal damage.</p>
<p>Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) According to military sources, the defense of Bizerte has entered a new stage after the Axis forces withdrew from Mateur. The area is well-protected by both Lake Bizerte and the surrounding mountains. As for the fact that the Anti-Axis forces are using Moroccan troops to attack the front lines of Bizerte, there are only two major reasons: (1) The Anti-Axis High Command believes that the battle in the Bizerte area will be the fiercest in the entire Tunisian campaign, so to avoid excessive sacrifices by white troops, Moroccans are being used as cannon fodder. (2) The British, Americans, and French rebels in Bizerte all want to seize the land for themselves. If they were to attack, conflicts would inevitably arise. To avoid this conflict, General Eisenhower has ordered Moroccan troops to attack.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency) According to the Swedish correspondent in London, the London financial community believes that the Axis withdrawal from Mateur marks a turning point in the final stage of the Tunisian war. Cautious observers warn the public to beware of traps set by the Germans, as a fierce German counterattack is highly likely. The correspondent solemnly stated that even the optimistic British believe that although the war situation seems to be favorable to the Anti-Axis powers, it is too early to think that the Axis powers are about to collapse. At the same time, the fortress of Bizerte has not been seriously threatened, as its outer perimeter has not been damaged. This kind of stone defense project built by the French gives the German and Italian troops a considerable advantage.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) A military correspondent for the Hai Tong News Agency stated that General Anderson unexpectedly withdrew a large number of fresh troops, especially artillery units, over the weekend to reinforce the left wing of the First Army at the Djebel Abiod pass in the Sedjenane area. As a result, the pressure from the American forces in that area on the Axis positions has increased. For several days, the city of Mateur has been under intense long-range artillery bombardment from British and American forces. In view of this situation, the Axis forces have decided to systematically withdraw from the northern side of the Tunisian front. The city of Mateur is also included in the withdrawal, but the American infantry is slow to follow, so the German and Italian forces have not engaged in encounter battles with them. In theory, the Anti-Axis forces have two possible courses of action: (1) The American forces may continue to advance westward along the coast of the Gulf of Tunis, so as to cut off the connection between the German and Italian forces stationed in Bizerte and General Arnim's main force. (2) The American forces may turn south and southeast. If this movement is successful, it will seriously threaten the German and Italian positions in Djebel and open a passage to Tunis for the central force of the British First Army. However, the German and Italian leaders may have made the necessary preparations to resist this. There are currently no changes in the central and southern sections of the Tunisian front. As of late Monday, the Anti-Axis activities in this area were limited to artillery fire and reconnaissance. There is no doubt that the Anti-Axis forces will redevelop their activities, especially in the area east of Medjez el Bab and west of Pont du Fahs. The only purpose is to contain the German forces, preventing them from withdrawing reserve troops to resist the American forces facing north. Judging from the situation of both sides, a large-scale offensive by the Anti-Axis forces in the central and northern sections at the same time is very possible and has already approached. Furthermore, judging from the general situation, the large number of British and American troops concentrated in Algeria may have other uses besides the Tunisian war. But in any case, it can be asserted that the Anti-Axis command has used these reserves to reinforce the troops fighting in Tunisia. Therefore, in future battles, the number of Anti-Axis troops will still be greater than that of the German and Italian troops, but the area currently held by the Axis forces will be further reduced after the completion of the withdrawal movement.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Still Underway in Krymskaya, Soviet Territory; German Troops Shift Their Position to the West of the Town</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) A military correspondent for the Hai Tong News Agency stated that the Soviet army has been constantly attacking the Kuban bridgehead held by the Germans for a week. Although the losses in manpower and material resources suffered by the Soviet army are also very serious, the pressure from the Soviet army has not only not decreased but has increased. During the attack, the Soviet army repeatedly decided to shift the focus of its offensive to the mountainous area on the eastern flank, between the saltwater lake area at the mouth of the Kuban River. Since noon on Monday, the fighting southeast of Krymskaya has been the most intense, and the battle is still underway, with no signs of weakening. According to military experts in Berlin, it is worth noting that the Soviet Union is fighting with powerful infantry and artillery units, and only occasionally using tanks. The Soviet army is concentrating a large number of elite troops in a small area, so it can break through the German lines, but the Soviet troops who enter the German positions are immediately cut off and isolated from their main force. The German army is now fighting fiercely to try to retake the land broken into by the Soviet army, and the Soviet army has deployed new troops, which shows that the Red Army command still intends to continue the attack. The current situation also shows that the Soviet side attaches great importance to the Kuban bridgehead, believing it to be the German base for threatening the Caucasus and the starting point for a possible large-scale German offensive.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) Qualified German military sources announced last night that after four consecutive days of Soviet attacks on the German positions east of the town of Krymskaya in the German Kuban bridgehead area, the German troops have now withdrawn from the town and moved to stronger positions prepared in advance to the west of the town. When the Soviet army attacked the old German positions there again on Monday morning with the help of heavy artillery and aircraft, only rear-guard units resisted. Before the withdrawal, the German troops had taken away all supplies and military supplies and completely destroyed important military facilities.</p>
<h3>The US Will Send Davies to the Soviet Union Again; Kerr Visits Molotov</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 4th (Central News Agency) The German News Agency reports that according to a telegram from London, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kerr, visited the Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov to convey the British government's views on the severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland. Kerr may hold further talks on this matter in Scotland, England.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) According to a Washington dispatch today, the Washington authorities are now considering sending Davies to Moscow again to invite Stalin, President Roosevelt, and Prime Minister Churchill to hold a special meeting. It is reported that Davies recently discussed this matter with President Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>Eden Hopes That the Soviet Union and Poland Will Quickly Resolve Their Dispute</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons on the 4th that he hoped that the governments of the Soviet Union and Poland would resolve the current dispute between the two countries with "political insight." However, the Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile, Sikorski, still showed a tough attitude in a broadcast on the London Central Broadcasting Station on the night of the 4th, so the conflict is intensifying. The theory that the Soviet Union will establish a Red Polish government in Moscow is also becoming more powerful. A correspondent from the New York Times in London bluntly stated in a report that the situation has become serious, meaning that although the current dispute between the Soviet Union and Poland was facilitated by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, if more flaws in the Anti-Axis camp are discovered, it will lead to an unprecedented split. The position of the current Polish government-in-exile can be described as a dilemma. Poland refused President Hitler's request for the Free City of Danzig, and as a result, lost most of its territory. It is difficult to explain the Soviet government's view that it is necessary to delineate new borders to protect its country and strive to develop its power in Eastern Europe. The Soviet government's policy is to seek more territory and to establish a second front by the Anti-Axis countries before close cooperation between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States can be realized. The public believes that Roosevelt's dispatch of his confidant Davies to Moscow is an attempt to resolve the major crisis in the Anti-Axis camp, but according to reports from the New York Times, the mutual disagreements have been fully exposed, and the situation is becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<h3>Australian Foreign Minister Meets with US Leaders in the US</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) According to a Washington dispatch, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt met with US Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins on the 3rd. On the 4th, he met with Roosevelt again, emphasizing the seriousness of the war in the Southwest Pacific and requesting reinforcements. Since arriving in Washington, Evatt has repeatedly met with US government officials and the heads of the Anti-Axis Allied Command. The main purpose of the talks is to request reinforcements. However, according to a report from the Australian Radio Washington correspondent, Evatt's talks with US government officials are now facing a crisis.</p>
<h3>French Commissioner of Martinique Protests to the US</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) Yesterday, US Secretary of State Hull announced that the State Department had received a diplomatic note from Robert, the senior French commissioner of Martinique, protesting the US withdrawal of its consul and the termination of food supplies to the island. Hull said: "The French commissioner's attitude is incomprehensible because the points on which it is based have all been abolished." When asked whether the US government would take further action on this protest, Hull replied that he could not make any announcements at this time, but the US Navy is currently patrolling the Caribbean Sea, and any new situation that may arise in the future will be mainly based on the Navy's judgment.</p>

<h3>A Great Tragedy in World History</h3>
<p>— Tokutomi Iichiro</p>
<p>(1) The Consequences of Utter Piracy</p>
<p>If there is a great tragedy in modern times, it is the fact that the British Empire is heading towards collapse. People of the world, whether friends or foes, are so bewildered by the many disturbances of the present war that they have hardly noticed this great tragedy unfolding before their eyes. This is just like the late Tokugawa shogunate period, when eight or nine out of ten Japanese people still regarded the then-shogunate, which had lost its soul and only had a body left, in the same way as the shogunate of the third shogun, Iemitsu, or the eighth shogun, Yoshimune, were regarded. Katsu Kaishu once wrote:</p>
<p>"The anchor line of a thousand fathoms cannot be held, drifting with the waves, who knows where it will reach!"</p>
<p>I wonder if Churchill, who is now wearing the signboard of the British Prime Minister, really has such an awareness?</p>
<p>In ancient times, the Roman general Scipio Africanus Major conquered Carthage and set its capital on fire. He watched as this once luxurious metropolis on the southern shore of the Mediterranean gradually turned into scorched earth, and suddenly recalled the verses of the poet Homer about the destruction of Troy and sighed. I wonder if there is anyone who sheds a tear of sympathy for England, which is now playing the role of modern Carthage? If Shakespeare, a great playwright of England, were to be resurrected today, he would probably throw down his pen and sigh at his powerlessness!</p>
<p>The so-called British Empire, until now, has been the richest and strongest country in the world, and also a top-notch cultural country. However, this country, its lifespan as a nation, has been close to two thousand years; however, its lifespan as the British Empire is only a quarter of that, no more than four or five hundred years. To be specific, it should be after Queen Elizabeth I. The author of "The Expansion of England" (1883), Sir J. R. Seeley, said:</p>
<p>"In the late years of Queen Elizabeth I, England had no colonies outside of Europe at all, and the British Empire did not yet exist. Scotland was still a separate country, and the British power in Ireland was only a small colony among foreign peoples."</p>
<p>Like this, the development of the British Empire is extremely modern. However, how did England, which was more backward than Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and even France, manage to build such a great empire and develop to the point where "the sun never sets on the lands of the British Queen Victoria"? Needless to say, it was entirely from the actions of pirates, relying on the lucky star of thieves, and being invincible everywhere. Now, let me give an example. England in the time of Cromwell was originally a so-called extreme Protestant country, achieving its revolution according to the essence of free people's rights. However, William Cowper at the time said:</p>
<p>"The Netherlands, whether in the ocean or in the New World, is a major commercial competitor of our country. Therefore, even if it is a Protestant force, it must be destroyed; even if we have to borrow the aid of a Catholic country to destroy it, it is worth it." They had such a heart, using violence entirely, to harm the competitors who were their opponents.</p>
<p>That is to say, the wars of England were not simply wars for hegemony; deep down, they always concealed commercial calculations of profit and loss. The war between England and France, for example, was caused by France taking the lead in North America, which England later wanted to seize; the same was true in India. In short, the wars of England were wars based on commerce, and from the beginning, the only question was whether the interests were worth the calculations. That is, they were not temporary pirates or occasional pirates, but permanent, planned, and large-scale continuous, common acts of piracy.</p>
<p>If there was a grasp of being able to win and gain something from winning, then they would immediately start doing it. As for who the opponent was, that was completely irrelevant, and they would not give up until the goal was achieved. In this way, they even built a great empire in the New World; unfortunately, however, they lost it due to the War of Independence; but a part of it—Canada—is still preserved to this day. India was first targeted by the French, who first invented how to take India. This method was: first, Indian troops were ultimately no match for European troops: second, if Indian chariots were trained, the result could be to conquer India with India. However, the British completely copied the method, using it to conquer India and drive the French out of India. Australia was formerly called New Holland, which England also seized from the Dutch; finally, South Africa was also snatched from the Dutch. The so-called Union of South Africa was actually established during the late years of Queen Victoria and the reign of Edward VII. The English, who were so thorough in their piratical nature, seized every opportunity to exert their nature, and sometimes even created opportunities for themselves, finally eating up the corners of the world like silkworms devouring mulberry leaves.</p>
<p>However, extreme joy begets sorrow. England began to decline during the Victorian era and the reign of Edward VII, and plunged sharply during the reign of George V. Regarding the decline of England, there were people who hinted at it and those who satirized it during its most prosperous Victorian era. Words such as "the tired Titan—the giant in mythology" and "the aging lion" gradually became synonymous with England.</p>
<p>Among those very few insightful Englishmen, there were even those who held deep anxieties about the future. An Englishman named Charles Pierson wrote a book in January 1893 entitled "National Life and Character," revealing extremely pessimistic predictions for the white race. The white race mentioned here, judging from the content, clearly refers to the Anglo-Saxons of England and America. After reading that book, I saw the signs of self-collapse in this great world empire, larger than three Roman empires, and could not help but recognize the dawn of the revival of my Great East Asia and felt unspeakable joy. The book was copied and translated by our company (Mainichi Shimbun) at the time and published under the title "The Future of the White Race," which I am sure some young people in the mid-Meiji era still remember.</p>
<p>Also, in 1906, the year after Japan defeated Russia, the "Adin" publishing house in Oxford, England, published a book entitled "The Decline of England," which was a fictional history of England, which had perished ten years earlier (i.e., 1995), published in Tokyo, Japan, in 2005 of the Western calendar, and used as a textbook in Japanese elementary schools. The author's pen name was Vivian Gray, and the real name was Eliot. E. Mills. In short, the intent of the book was nothing more than for the British to use the textbook of a Japanese elementary school to make their own people aware of the decline of their own country.</p>
<p>The book lists nine reasons for the decline: first, urban life oppresses rural life, harming the health and beliefs of the British people. Second, the British people of the twentieth century only knew about health resorts and no longer cared about the ocean. Third, becoming extremely weak and extravagant. Fourth, the taste for literature and drama tended to be decadent. Fifth, the physique and health of the British people gradually declined. Sixth, knowledge and moral life declined among the British people. Seventh, taxes were levied greedily and endlessly, and municipal expenses were used excessively. Eighth, educational falsehoods prevailed in England. Ninth, the British people's self-defense and national defense capabilities became increasingly weak. (According to the translation by Mr. Shohtaro Kimura)</p>
<p>In recent times, there is also the book "The Decline and Fall of the British Empire," published in 1940. The author of this book, Robert Briffault, excerpted, prefaced, and added annotations and reviews, describing it quite harshly and quite pleasantly. We will only mention its title now, and for the time being, avoid the trouble of describing its contents. In short, the so-called decline of England has been growing thicker and thicker day by day in the last fifty years, and a touch of sorrow, like a nightmare, has naturally enveloped the British Empire.</p>
<p>I wonder if England is already aware of this situation or has already acknowledged it? In short, after the middle age of the British Queen, she revealed the so-called imperial righteousness, this treasure, and tried to use blood transfusion methods. The then Prime Minister Disraeli forcing the crown of the Emperor of India on the head of the British Queen was also that method. The theories of Seeley, Rosebery, Dilke, and even Joseph Chamberlain's imperialism, were the most prominent, and the one who was a trumpeter in the capacity of a literary man was Rudyard Kipling.</p>
<p>However, these special blood transfusion methods did not have the effectiveness that those people had hoped for, and in the end, they promoted the decline of England.</p>
<p>The First World War really put England at the crossroads of life and death. On the surface, England won this war and Germany was defeated. If England could make good use of this victory and seek ways to self-renewal, then England might have been able to be reborn through this opportunity. Who knew that she would misuse this victory, spending the next twenty years in temporary peace, and finally reaching today's state. On the contrary, Germany, like a convalescing typhoid patient, had changed the structure of its body and was reborn. And the relationship between England and Germany has completely reversed the position of twenty years ago in today's twenty years later.</p>
<p>In 1896, England once relied on the book "Made in Germany" to make people aware of the fact that everything was made in Germany in any store on the streets of London, so that old habits could be renewed and ways to return to rationalism could be sought. Rosebery was one of the main figures. However, that situation ended there, and finally the First World War passed. Afterwards, there was almost no concern for the state of Germany. Apart from today's Prime Minister Churchill, only a very few people have issued warnings about this.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, it has already been brought to a point where there is no way out. However, upon further examination, the reason why England has reached today's state cannot but be said to be the result of accumulated evils. England is thoroughly piratical; its prosperity and development, even to the creation of a world-scale empire, is due to piracy, and its gradual collapse is also due to piracy. There is a saying, "Take by force, keep by virtue," but England is completely taking by force and keeping by force from beginning to end. England cannot even take Ireland, which is close at hand, as its wings, let alone the nearly 400 million Indians? However, on the other hand, England's enemy is not Japan, nor Germany, Italy, France, and certainly not the Soviet Union; England's enemy is its colonies Canada and Australia, and the biggest is India.</p>
<p>However, they are still enduring England for now, and today they are about to swallow England in one gulp, and the one that has already swallowed half of it, is the United States, which surpasses its teacher. However, it is England itself that has made the United States show its wolfish heart towards England. Now England is moving forward day by day towards the realm of so-called self-inflicted and self-destruction. If this is not called a tragedy, then what in human history is a tragedy? Moreover, the tragedy is entirely a tragedy of fratricide. The son of a pirate and the son of a pirate compete for the spoils, and eventually devour each other, which is the ultimate tragedy.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Was the May Fourth Youth Day—A Celebration Was Held—The New Movement Association and the Youth Corps Telegraph Their Respects</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the national May Fourth Youth Day. The Shanghai Branch of the New National Movement Promotion Association and the Shanghai Municipal Headquarters of the Chinese Youth Corps held a celebration in the city government auditorium. Three banners were hung in front of the city government gate, with large red characters, "Obey the Leader, Implement the Doctrine," "Be Brave and Diligent, Endure Hardship," and "Revive China, Defend East Asia," which were very eye-catching. National flags were hung high in front of the gate and in the auditorium, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere. Secretary Zhao, representing Mayor Chen, Section Chief Ling of the city government, all staff of the New Movement Association and the Municipal Corps, and representatives of youth groups from more than 30 public and private primary and secondary schools in the city, a total of 700 students, dressed neatly and in high spirits, attended. The ceremony began at 10:00 am, presided over by Chief Secretary Xi of the Shanghai Branch of the New Movement Association, who led the ceremony and delivered the opening remarks. Secretary Zhao then delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen. Finally, the telegram of respect was read and slogans were shouted before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The text of the tribute telegram to Chairman Wang Jingwei of the Nanjing National Government: "We humbly believe that in the three years since the return to the capital, we are fortunate to have your leadership of the masses, laying the foundation of the country on a solid rock, building with difficulty, and planning for the prosperity of East Asia. Now, on the occasion of the first May Fourth Youth Day, this branch has convened a celebration in the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium on this day, gathering representatives of youth groups from all over the city. In a warm and solemn mood, we all rejoice that the day after the leader's magnificent descent is also the festival of polishing youth. Since the events are coincidental, the meaning is even deeper. We should follow the instructions, promote the New Movement, review past work, recognize current responsibilities, work hard day and night, strive together with one heart and one mind to build China and protect East Asia, and send our respects by telegram, hoping for your wise attention. Respectfully, the Shanghai Special City Branch of the New National Movement Promotion Committee, the Shanghai Special City Corps of the Chinese Youth Corps, humbly bow."</p>
<p>Secretary Zhao's speech briefly stated that China's 5,000-year history has been accumulated by countless youths of past generations. From this, we can imagine the responsibility of our youth, who bear the mission of "building on the past and opening up the future." We should value ourselves, review our work, and train ourselves in concrete ways. In terms of "mind," we should use wisdom and thought to seek rich knowledge. In terms of "strength," we should use labor to serve society and seek action. In this way, using both mind and strength to lay the foundation for youth undertakings, because it is too late to regret when one is old if one does not study when one is young, the ancients have clear teachings, and we should put these words into practice and carry forward our spirit to gradually do so. What is the central task of building on the past and opening up the future, the common goal? It is to revive China and defend East Asia. At the same time, we must recognize that to revive China, we must first invigorate ourselves, and to invigorate ourselves, we must start with the youth. Today's youth are the backbone of China in the future, and they are also the driving force for the revival of China.</p>

<h3>No Champion Produced in the Western League Football Division A—Russian Team Wins Division B, An Wah Wins Division C</h3>
<p>The Western League football tournament for this season (1942-1943) could not be fully completed due to venue issues. However, the Division B champion has been produced. The Russian team won Division B, St. John's was the runner-up, and Yousheng was third, followed by the Overseas Chinese. After that were the Japanese Association, the Pede Association, the Rowens, and the Russian Emigrants Gilyem at the bottom. An Wah Association won the Division C championship, while Hequn sadly ranked second, and the Junior Association was the third. Several games in Divisions B and C have not yet been completed, but they are irrelevant to the championship. However, the Division A championship has become difficult to produce due to the stalemate between the Italian Army and the Lianyi team. According to a notice from the Western League Secretariat yesterday, the Executive Committee of the League decided that no champion would be produced in Division A, because according to the results of the first round, the Italian Army ranked first, and the current situation is that Lianyi has two more points, but the Italian Army has one less game than Lianyi, and the two are difficult to distinguish.</p>
<h3>Lianyi Cup Inaugural Performance—St. John's vs. Xuhui United—This Sunday at Xuhui</h3>

<p>Economic Circles—Comments</p>
<h3>Small Industry Loan Syndicate</h3>
<p>In the future, the normal business of the financial world will be to support production, and the main tool for supporting production will be loan syndicates. In the past two weeks, news about agricultural loans and industrial loans has been spreading very enthusiastically, which shows the shift in the direction and targets of lending in the financial world in the future: the new direction and targets are: to help legitimate production and stabilize the lives of the people.</p>
<p>Recently, some people in the financial community, in view of the position of handicrafts and small industries in the stage of China's industrial development, have actively advocated the organization of a "Small Industry Loan Syndicate", and have specifically put forward concrete opinions on the use of loans, the amount of loans, loan guarantees, loan interest, and loan methods. Undoubtedly, this is a good way to improve financial activities and increase production power.</p>
<p>Speaking of this issue, this column published an article on March 2 entitled "Production Problems of Small Factories," in which there were the following words: "China is a country with an agricultural economic form, and industrial development is still very immature; from the perspective of productivity, the transformation from manual to mechanical production is still in progress. Therefore, small industries still occupy an important position in the overall production volume... Many banks and money shops do not regard these small factories as lending targets. Although public opinion advocates lending more to industry, in reality, they still maintain the policy of those who seek being rejected and those who reject being supplied. This policy has harmed the growth of many production institutions."</p>
<p>Now, such an unreasonable policy has changed. Our further expectation is that, regarding the lending method, in addition to investigating the production status of each factory at any time and whether the loan is used for improper purposes, we must also constantly provide technical guidance. Assuming that it is known that the loan is used for legitimate purposes, but after the loan is granted, we are still only concerned about issues such as loan guarantees and loan interest, and we turn a blind eye to the management and guidance of small industries, then the meaning of supporting production may not be fully realized. Therefore, we specifically put this forward for the consideration of the "Small Industry Loan Syndicate."</p>
<h3>Joint Organization of Chinese, Japanese, and Third-Country Warehouses Decided: Unified Control of Warehouses Can Be Centralized in the Future</h3>
<p>Since the government authorities sent personnel to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate hoarding, the relevant parties have felt that the trend of hoarding in this port cannot be eradicated because comprehensive control over Chinese, Japanese, and third-country warehouses cannot be implemented. Therefore, in order to assist the authorities in preventing hoarding, the Chinese and Japanese warehouse operators in this port have decided to organize a "Warehouse Industry Federation" by the warehouse operators of China, Japan, and third countries to facilitate the supervision of the dynamics of materials in each warehouse. It is learned that the Chinese and Japanese warehouse operators in this port recently held the first joint meeting, with the "Shanghai Special City Warehouse Industry Guild" representing the Chinese side and the "Japanese Association Warehouse" representing the Japanese side. As a result of the agreement between the two parties, it was decided that the Chinese warehouse industry would unite with the bank warehouses, and the Japanese warehouse association would unite with the warehouses of East Asia Shipping, China Shipping, inland river shipping, and other transportation organizations. The third-country side will be a union of warehouses from Germany, Italy, and Spain. In mid-next month, individual organizations will be established separately, and then the three organizations will form the "Shanghai Warehouse Industry Federation" to complete the unified control of Shanghai warehouses.</p>
<p>The "Sino-Japanese Cotton Product Agreement Council" under the National Commercial Control Association held its first meeting on the 30th of last month. The Chinese side was represented by the "China Cotton Product Industry Association," and the Japanese side was represented by the "Central China Cotton Product Industry Association." It is learned that the work of the Council is as follows: (1) Production, distribution, and other related matters of cotton products. (2) Determining the quantity and price of cotton product distribution. (3) Connecting the relationship between the Chinese and Japanese cotton product associations. (4) Necessary investigation and research matters. (5) Arbitrating and mediating disputes between Chinese and Japanese counterparts. The list of Chinese and Japanese members of the Council is as follows: Chairman Jiang Shangda, Vice Chairman Ling Tian Yi Ci, Managing Director Nie Lusheng, San Ze Tu Zhi, Director Cheng Jingtang, Tong Runfu, Ding Fangyuan, Tian Cao, Gu Wo Chen Ji Tsukamoto Suketaro. Supervisors Tang Zhiliang, Guo Dihao, Kimura Sakon, Honda Daisaku.</p>

<h3>Deceptive Embellishment</h3>
<p>— Zhen Diaoge</p>
<p>People have a common problem, which is deceptive embellishment.</p>
<p>A young student makes a heterosexual friend. Even though they are secretly calling each other "sister," "love," and "darling," if you advise them, "It's best not to be in love while studying," then they will act as if they have been wronged and say, "Who's in love? We're just ordinary friends!"; they might even say you're a "relic of the 18th century." When they get married, even if the ceremony and banquet are held at a fancy hotel or dance hall, with money being thrown around like dirt, their announcement still says, "In these extraordinary times, everything will be kept simple." When their parents die, the brothers might be fighting like cats and dogs over the inheritance, but the obituary still says, "The unfilial sons, etc., have committed grave sins," and then there's, "The orphaned son XXX weeps blood and touches his forehead to the ground."</p>
<p>There are too many examples of this sort of thing to list. The reason for it is that they want to maintain their superficial "reputation" on the one hand, while satisfying their own "interests" and "desires" on the other. Since "you can't have both," deceptive embellishment arises as a "last resort."</p>
<p>Because of deceptive embellishment, we have suffered countless wounds. People who have no strength insist on calling themselves strongmen; people who have no money insist on acting like big shots. They are all just trying to look imposing by slapping their faces until they swell! But friends, even if you can look imposing by slapping your face until it swells, the pain of a visible sore is still yours! How will you cope when today's deceptive embellishment is exposed tomorrow?</p>
<p>How does being exposed for deceptive embellishment compare to not having embellished in the first place?</p>
<h3>Shanghai Miscellany (2)</h3>
<p>— Hashimoto Kansetsu</p>
<p>Liu Haisu, the president of the Shanghai Art School, and Wang Jiyuan, who has been to Japan several times, have gone to present-day Shonan because of the incident and have not yet returned. Both of them are Western-style painters.</p>
<p>Liu Haisu has both courage and managerial talent, and I admire him especially. He has contributed a lot to the cultural cooperation between China and Japan. Once I talked to him about this issue and asked for his opinion. At that time, the Shanghai Art School had 300 students in the Western-style painting department. Most of the students studying Western-style painting were children of the bourgeoisie and the poor, and there were no middle-class students. Among the poor students, some had communist ideas. I said to him, "Why don't we just disband it! What do you think?" He shook his head and said that disbanding it seemed too early, and it would be better to ask the bad elements to withdraw. "What! If they are exiled, it will be more troublesome, and there will be meritorious deeds from outside," I said. He said that it would not take ten days to recruit 300 students, but he finally went to Paris to study. After arriving in Paris, I received two or three letters from him, and then we never met again. When he went to Shonan, I thought, if only I knew their residence, it would be great if I could find them and meet everyone. Yu Jifan and Jiang Xiaojian, who graduated from Tokyo Art School, spoke fluent Japanese and served in the Nanjing government. I heard that Mr. Jiang, who was a sculptor, died after the incident. There are very few new sculptors in China now, so Mr. Jiang's death is really a pity. His works still remain in West Lake or other places.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I wrote an article in this newspaper's New Year's special issue entitled "The Spirit of Oriental Painting and War Paintings." The article said: Mi Nan Gong was from West Asia and believed in Islam, which Japanese scholars have affirmed. It is even said that Su Dongpo was a migrant. As for Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, who are familiar to everyone in the history of the Three Kingdoms, judging from their demeanor and appearance, they may also be people of the migrant tribe. Especially Guan Yu, like the Tenmangu Shrine in Japan, is worshipped and sacrificed everywhere in China. If we study it, we may have unexpected and interesting new discoveries. Ten years ago, someone in the Chinese press said that Li Taibai was not Chinese, but a migrant, a Turk, and many people spent a lot of effort to study this matter.</p>
<p>For example, in the Taibai Collection, a poem "To a Distant Friend" says: "Lu Gao is like jade frost, and the pen is inscribed with the Yuezhi script," and there is also "I once comforted the exile in the West Sea. Because of the many lines, every word is wronged." From the words Yuezhi script and West Sea, it can be known that he knew foreign languages. Also, in the "Ode to the Great Horse," there is a line "The Heavenly Horse comes from the Yuezhi cave." The Ode to the Heavenly Horse is a poem he wrote in his old age after resigning from office, comparing himself to a Heavenly Horse, implying that he came from a foreign country as a youth. The Wei Zhi described his appearance as: "His eyes were bright and fierce, like those of a hungry tiger," and Cui Zongzhi's poem said that he "shone brightly with his double eyes." Furthermore, his fondness for martial arts and fighting in his youth is cited as evidence. He once held an important position in the Tang Dynasty like the modern Minister of Foreign Affairs, adopting the so-called method of controlling barbarians with barbarians. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, April 22)</p>
<h3>Trickles and Confluence</h3>
<p>— Prisoner</p>
<p>There are often some "quotations" or "cultivation quotes" in the newspapers, which we call "trickles." Of course, there is truth in every sentence, telling us the "direction" of how to be a person. But if we can only achieve one or two drops of these so-called "trickles," it will not be very successful for the whole life. Therefore, we must "merge" these fragmented "trickles." In a small way, personal cultivation must be like this. In a big way, the success of a career is not like this?</p>
<p>For example, take the water dripping from a tap. If it can eternally drip to one point, then over time, even cement will be dripped into a small hole! Yes, this is the power of trickles, but this power relies on being able to converge on one point. If each drop of water is scattered here and there, then the cement will never be dripped into a hole. Even a torrential rain will not be able to move the cement at all!</p>
<p>From this, we can know that the power of trickles is amazing, but it must be merged, "planned", and "purposeful". Usually, we should not only pay attention to being polite and pleasing, but also pay attention to learning how to be a person everywhere. In terms of career, it is not enough to just solve a few difficulties. We must have a plan and a purpose to connect and link them together, have unified consideration and arrangement, and merge all the strength to deal with it, without losing any small drop of power. If we do this, the hope of success can be realized.</p>
<p>It is not easy to merge trickles, as difficult as merging every drop of water, because there is air resistance and wind pressure, and it is inevitable that it will be scattered here and there. Therefore, the trickles themselves must be strong and powerful, heavy and urgent, have a fixed direction, and have perseverance to keep dripping towards the correct goal. Can you say that its power is not great?</p>
<h3>On the Toxic Reactions of Vitamin B1</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Recently, the medical community has discovered the phenomenon of reactions when vitamin B1 is injected into certain patients. This type of reaction has also been discovered several times by the foreign medical community.</p>
<p>Since vitamin B1 was discovered to have a very important relationship with our health, its application in treatment has become increasingly frequent. The dosage of vitamin B1 has never been fixed, but it is generally believed that it has little or no toxicity. Therefore, in order to achieve rapid results, it is often given to patients in amounts several times or even dozens of times higher than the daily needs, but no significant effects or significant adverse effects are seen. Recently, Professor C.A. Mills of the Oineiooate Medical School in the United States discovered that a woman who took 10 mg of vitamin B1 daily experienced headache, insomnia, sensitivity, increased pulse, weakness, and tremors for one and a half weeks, which were similar to the toxic effects of taking too much thyroxine. This reaction completely disappeared within two days after stopping taking vitamin B1. After a week of rest, the patient took vitamin B1 again at a dose reduced to 5 mg, but after four weeks, the same toxic reaction occurred again and disappeared after stopping taking it.</p>
<p>Professor Mills also observed the toxic reactions of vitamin B1 in the tropical regions of Panama. When the human body is in a hot environment, it needs more vitamin B1 than in temperate regions. It is easy for foreigners living in this area to develop vitamin deficiency. When doctors encounter this type of patient, they must use a very high dose (20-40 mg) of vitamin B1. As a result, the occurrence of toxic reactions is also common, and the situations are similar. This reaction also disappears after stopping taking it. Therefore, this type of reaction may be caused by patients taking or injecting excessive doses of vitamin B1.</p>
<p>The toxic reactions of vitamin B1 are also related to the deficiency of other vitamins. Professor Morgan of the University of California conducted an experiment on animals and saw that supplementing only one or two types of vitamin B often did more harm than good if they lacked many of the B vitamins. Because the vitamin B group now includes at least twelve nutritional elements, the situation of deficiency is extremely complex, and simply supplementing with one type of B1 often does not help. Therefore, this type of toxic reaction can also be said to be caused by an unbalanced effect. The medical community in this port is now making every effort to study the detailed reasons, and it is expected that it will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Perspective</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xin</p>
<p>Painting has a point of view of perspective, simply perspective; there is also a point of view of perspective on the road of life:</p>
<p>On the road of life, the distance seems small and the near seems large. However, the distance shows us the direction and is also the destination we want to reach. We must advance, and our eyes must be on the distance at all times. Otherwise, if we only greedily look at the wildflowers by the roadside and linger on the beautiful scenery in front of us, ignoring the distance, we will inevitably lose the direction of the road ahead or forget the task of our journey. As a result, we will either go astray or be unable to move forward. The frog in the well, because it is content in a narrow circle and cannot see the distance, its knowledge is also childishly pathetic. Therefore, if we do not pay attention to the distance, we are laggards on the road of life.</p>
<p>As for the near, it cannot be ignored either, because although there are smooth roads in the near, there are also thorns and ditches; sometimes we have to face abysses, and sometimes we have to walk on thin ice. For thorns, we must eliminate them; for ditches, we must cross them; for abysses and thin ice, we must be even more careful, so that we can move forward continuously and safely reach our destination. Otherwise, if we only stare at the starlight in the distance and ignore the near, we will have already been tripped by thorns, and then we will fall into ditches, or fall into abysses, or fall under the ice. How can we reach the place indicated by the starlight? Therefore, if we do not pay attention to the near, we are also laggards on the road of life.</p>
<p>In painting, it takes both distance and proximity to be a master painter; on the road of life, it takes both distance and proximity to be a master traveler.</p>
<h3>A Truth</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhengyang</p>
<p>In a certain registration office, the clerks are busy working.</p>
<p>A very presentable gentleman walks in, wearing leather shoes. He first leans his cane against the table, and then casually takes off his felt hat and puts it on the table:</p>
<p>"Hey, register!"</p>
<p>One of the clerks puts down his pen, looks up, and puts on a very awkward smile:</p>
<p>"Yes, yes... Mr., what's your name?"</p>
<p>"Huang."</p>
<p>"How do you write it?"</p>
<p>"Huang, the Huang with the leader character (黃)!" He seems very impatient.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's the Huang (黃) from Huang Yanpei! Ah, Mr. Huang, it's an honor to meet you!"</p>
<p>The gentleman snorts through his nose.</p>
<p>All the procedures are completed, and the clerk gives a piece of paper to the gentleman, and puts on an ugly face that is both smiling and not smiling.</p>
<p>The gentleman takes the paper, his cane, and his felt hat, walks away with a swagger, wearing leather shoes.</p>
<p>After a while, a very ragged old man walks in:</p>
<p>"Sir, register?"</p>
<p>"Hmph, what's your name?"</p>
<p>"Huang."</p>
<p>"How do you write it?" He seems very impatient.</p>
<p>"Huang, the Huang (黃) with the grass head (艹)." He smiles obsequiously.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's the Huang (黃) from Huang Gou (黃狗, yellow dog)!"</p>
<p>The poor old man takes the paper, frowns, and leaves.</p>
<p>So, I understood a "truth" in today's society: with money, you can be a saint; without money, you only deserve to be livestock.</p>
<h3>Regarding Gambling Dens</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhong</p>
<p>If someone says that establishing gambling dens can revive the market, then everything related to corrupting erotic secret dramas can be called "sex education." Therefore, I will be blunt, the person who says this is either out of their mind or has "ulterior motives."</p>
<p>Because of "gambling dens," newspapers have increased a lot of "material" in the social news section: absconding, fraud, embezzlement, robbery, suicide, ... and so on. Therefore, some people say that "gambling dens" are "human destroyers."</p>
<p>Although we say that gamblers are "courting death" themselves, as "clear-headed bystanders," how can we bear to sit and watch these batches of "fellow humans" go to "their deaths?"</p>
<p>Today's ruling authorities are concerned about people's livelihoods and national wealth everywhere. Speculation should be investigated and punished, and gambling dens should be investigated and banned with special punishments. Fortunately, the authorities have already expressed their stern determination.</p>
<p>Here, we look forward to making these so-called "teahouses" and "restaurants" into "human destroyers" that become a name in "history" in the shortest possible time. (Reward for assisting in the suppression of gambling)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Native Place Associations Organize Scholarships and Small Loans</h3>
<p>The Ningbo and Zhenjiang Shanghai Native Place Associations have successively established scholarships and small loans for poor children. All matters related to investigation, review, consultation, and disbursement are personally handled by the committee members. The Anhui and Taizhou Shanghai Native Place Associations followed suit. The Zhenjiang Native Place Association has recently launched a campaign to expand the fundraising for the small loan fund (see yesterday's column), which is a good example for other native place associations. The origin of the campaign states: "We have heard that mutual assistance among human beings is the highest virtue, and helping the poor and relieving the needy is a righteous act passed down through generations. Most of our fellow townsmen in Shanghai are engaged in lower and middle-class industrial and commercial businesses. Since the incident, due to the contraction of shops and the dissolution of factories, many people have lost their jobs and should be rescued. Although there are many ways to provide relief, the easiest and most convenient is small loans. Small loans are not donations. The borrowers can use the funds obtained as a tool for making a living, and the lending institutions can continue to recover the loans in installments during the relief efforts, while encouraging them to earn a living on their own."</p>
<p>Compilation of the Rumin Hospital</p>
<p>(1) The Jingcheng Civilian Clinic provides free medical care for the poor and sick. Address: No. 2, Lane 21, Chengdu Road (Telephone 32973). Hours: 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM.

(2) The China Pharmacy at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Parker Road has added a civilian prescription department starting from the 2nd, with a completely low-profit principle. For civilian prescriptions, if it is indeed due to poverty, they are allowed to be sold at a reduced price or half price to fulfill the purpose of serving the society. (3) Mr. Cheng Shiqing had been suffering from eye disease for a long time. A month ago, he was introduced by this office to Dr. Ji Yongjun, an ophthalmologist on the second floor of the Zhengwei Pharmacy on Carter Road, for examination and treatment. After three visits, the obstruction in his eye has disappeared, and his vision is clearer than before. He will return to normal within a month. Mr. Cheng deeply admires Dr. Liu's superb medical skills and his service to society and preferential treatment of the poor and sick.</p>

A small reward will be given to anyone who finds and returns it. Shen Zhong</p>
