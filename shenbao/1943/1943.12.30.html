<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本八十四屆　議會之展望</h3>
<p>日本第八十四屆議會，於本月二十六日上午在貴族院會　塲舉行開院式，二十七日通過勅語奉答文，及對陸海軍之感謝决議案後，即結東本年內議事，預定明年一月二十一日再開全體會議。這次日水議會，適在世界戰局向决戰階段邁進的時期，也正在波根維爾島海空戰勝利之後，日本國民，均在極度興奮與緊張的狀態之中舉行的，其主要任務，即在促進舉國一心，以爭取戰爭勝利。</p>
<p>在決戰局面日趨重大性的新階段，展望明年一月下旬將繼續舉行的八十四屆議會，誠有無限的期待。東條首相於二十七日報告戰局的結論中即會明白指出目前日本國民最重要的奮鬥方向：「於茲須特別注意者，即增援戰之重要，其重點即資材之生產及運輸二點。」（二十七日東京中央社電）這是日本最近數月來加强推行「强化國內决戰態勢」運動的中心，也即是今後議會繼續開院時所將决定的預算案及法律案的主要內容。據東條首相的報告，可知關於資材的生產，已因日本全國國民之熱烈協力，使飛機等增產之成果，頗有可觀。而運輸方面，亦因與海軍密切協力，以及後方國民之努力而「可期其毫無遺憾」。今後八十四屆議會繼續開院審議預算案及其他法律案時，必能使國內决戰態勢之強化對策，獲得更重大之效果。</p>
<p>最近敵方根據其謀略宣傳，從開羅會議對日本的宣言，以至德黑蘭會議以來所謂對德包圍反攻態勢之展開，在在表現今後局勢之將日趨嚴重。然而，這種宣傳，對於軸心諸國，尤其是對於盟邦日本，絕不足以撼動毫末。束條首相在議會報吿中說得痛快：「敵方陷於今日之焦燥而急圖反攻狀態，實不言可喻，為我可以擊滅敵軍之良機，故敵方此種態度，對我方反而有利·」所以希望「全體軍民堅定必勝信念，發揮强烈之攻擊精神，以不屈不撓之决意，澈底邁進戰爭」。我們深信，一月二十一日復會的日本八十四屆議會，在加强日本全國「萬衆一心，達成戰爭目的」的總目標，必有重大貢獻。</p>
<p>因為進入決戰階段，必須加强國內態勢以爭取勝利；要求加强國內態勢，必須取得全民協力。日本深切感覺這一需要，故在每次議會以後，必有强化國內態勢的事實表現。自從大東亞會議以後，日本的任務更大，一方面擊破敵人的反攻；一方面尤須實踐大柬亞宜言·所以，這次議會以後，必將更見日本官民協力强化國內態勢。反觀我國參戰近年，所負使命正與盟邦相同。而官民協力，强化國內態勢工作，實瞠乎其後，即類似日本議會，促進官民協力的民意機構，尙未建立。然而，參戰的任務，無法諉卸，我們希望朝野注意，從速團結協力，强化戰時態勢，協同爭取勝利，實踐大東亞宜言的義務。</p>
<h3>拉巴爾壯烈空戰　日海軍機隊奏捷　阿羅埃前線美軍被迫撤退</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日大本營二十九日下午四時發表：我海軍　隊曾於十二月二十八日最，在拉巴爾邀擊來襲之戰鬥機約五十架，旋即擊落其三十一架（內有十架未經證實），我方損害，飛機三架禾返。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　敵軍在新不列顚島西南方及西北築成橋頭堡後，因遭日機不斷猛烈轟炸，損書極大，但其窺伺拉巴爾之野心，仍不肯輕易放棄，故連日反覆攻擊拉巴爾及該方面日軍基地。二十八日拂曉又以戰鬥機五十架編除來攻拉巴爾。日海軍戰鬥機隊即迎擊之，經壯烈空戰後，擊落敵機三十一架，擊落率佔來襲之敵機十分之六，此可見日空軍之勇敢矣。日空軍於二十七日在拉巴爾上空迎擊敵機五十架，擊落其二十三架，是役日機喪失僅三架。按敵機十五日在馬加斯角登陸以來，截止二十入日，來襲之敵機約有五百十九架，被日海軍機隊擊落者共有百八十二架，幾達敵機總數三分之一。</p>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　據新幾內亞島反軸心軍基地電　西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部二十八日發表稱：該方面美軍前進部隊，因馬加斯角之日軍守備隊自三路猛烈反攻，阿羅埃附近之美軍前哨綫，故被迫向後撤退。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　據南太平洋某基地電，敵於二十八日以艦載機及轟炸機合計約百架編隊·來襲波根維爾島布英及聖特蘭島，日海軍機隊當即迎擊，將其四架擊落，日方損書極微。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　據南太平洋某基地電，日海軍航空隊二十八日夜襲擊新幾內亞島芬希哈罕敵機場，有二處中彈起火，又有一處烈焔騰空，日機全部安返。</p>
<h3>日軍冬季進攻　獲重大戰果　採用突進突破戰術</h3>
<p>漢口二十九日中央社電此次日華中軍之冬季進攻作戰，自十一月二日開始以來，即以怒濤之勢，績行進攻。於東西三百公里，南北百數十公里之廣大地域內，猛攻渝第六戰　軍。擊滅其十個軍，合計二十八個師，澈底覆滅。渝方防禦重慶之中核地帶，已獲偉大戰果，完全達成擊碎渝防衛戰力之目的。日作戰軍已於十二月二十五日，恢復原來態勢。</p>
<p>實行內地進攻作戰</p>
<p>此次日軍以突進突破　　，實行內地進攻作戰，非企圖奪取一城一鎭，乃在擊碎渝軍戰力，覆滅常德附近之渝軍防禦陣地，俾澈底擊滅渝抗戰力根幹之第六戰區戰者，故於渝陣營之打擊甚大。日軍擊滅渝軍二十八個師之兵力，覆滅其費時數年，用　數億，於常德附近構築之防禦陣地，已足對世界顯示日軍之强烈一戰力。常德以南之渝第六戰區，殆無預備軍，渝軍完全喪失封鎖日軍突破上之餘力，為救援常德，乃自渝第九戰區，及南昌方面增派援軍兩次。第一次之渝第十第九十九，第一百，第三軍，於常德南方地區，為日軍殲滅。第二次之渝暫編第二，第五十九，第七十二等三軍，亦畏　日軍之威力。日軍則以巧妙之作戰，到處將其擊滅，卒未使渝軍達威救援常德之目的，又突破常德防衛綫之獲滅戰，於廣大地域上展開兩月後，已暗示攻略重慶亦非不可能者。</p>
<p>鹵獲品中大砲獨多</p>
<p>此外尚有一特　，即鹵獲品中大砲較過去作戰增多，總計山砲速射砲及迫擊砲等，約一百五十八門。此與過去比較，已顯著增多．如第一次長沙作戰為七十門，第二次長沙作戰為八十五門，宜昌作戰為四十餘門，大別山作戰為六門，浙贛作戰為一百三十門，江南殲滅作戰為九十門。日軍鹵虜如此大量武器，其主因有二，一為日軍實行突進。突破作戰包圍，急襲渝　。一則實行澈底進攻內地，與渝精銳軍接觸，將其殲滅。之故云</p>
<p>日大本營發發表戰果</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日大本營於二十九日下午二時發表，　我陸軍部隊，自十一月二日起，於洞鏖湖西方地區作戰，擊滅渝方抗戰力之根幹第六第九兩戰區之渝軍主力，並將該方面要　常德附近之渝軍事設施，完全覆滅。　我作戰部隊，於完全達成所期目的後，已於十二月二十五日，恢復原來態勢。　本作戰中之綜合戰果如次：予渝軍之損害，收容渝軍遺屍三二七四七具，俘虜一四三二五人。於當德附近擊落敵機六十架，主要鹵獲品大砲一五八門，重機關槍六五七挺，步槍六三五六枝，各種子彈二百三十六萬發，我方損害陣亡一六六六人。</p>
<h3>首都青少年　總奮起大會　林總監親臨致訓</h3>

<p>學生清互運動辦法</p>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　中國靑少年團總監中國靑年模範圖書記長林柏生氏，為使各地靑少年學生自動發起之淸毒運動，更發揮其積極實踐之建設性，吸集力量早竟全功起見，特擬定辦法，副令中國靑少年團各省市團部，及中國靑年模範團各聯隊部，各直屬隊部。規定辦法如左：　所有各省市靑少年學生，關於淸毒運動之組織，應一律呈由新國民運動促進委員會分會，轉呈新國民遝動促進委員會備案。省市以下由支會轉呈分會備案，並將工作計劇大綱呈核，以資劃一，而利進行。　各省市靑少年學生及淸毒運動團體，關於淸毒運動之各種行動，務須遵守國家法令，維持國體紀律，應由靑少年團各省市團部（省市以下類推），切實負責督導集合遊行，幷應依法商得當地憲　機關許可，以維治安，而防流弊。　明年度具體實踐計劃，及工作步驟，由總團部及團本部，彙徵靑少年學生意見，分別呈請政府採擇施行，及交由各地靑少年團部，及淸毒運動團體，切實推進。靑少年學生對於淸毒運動之意見及建議，應從速向總團部團本部提出。</p>

<h3>滇渝軍指揮官　陳誠辭職原因</h3>
<p>廣州二十九日中央社電　雲南方面最高指揮官陳城，此次辭職，傳其理由，係因日軍在怒江作戰之際，東南亞軍司令官曼特巴頓持冷淡態度，傍視渝軍　陷於困境，袖手不作援助，致陳誠憤慨之之上空，已準備邀擊，日機當即與其展開激戰。約二十分鐘後，擊落渝機八架（內一架未證實，）並轟炸停放地上之北美P25型機七架，及P40型機二架，及P40型機一架起火。同時炸毁P25型機五架，日機則全部安返原防地云。</p>
<h3>德大使館新年　不舉行招待</h3>
<p>二南京十九日中央社電　據本京德大使館確息，以今年正在戰事期問，德大使决定新年不器行正式招待。</p>
<h3>日機空襲　贛遂川機塲</h3>

<h3>美鋼鐵業　工人復工</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　據華盛頓息：美工業聯合會主席穆賴向罷工之鋼鐵工人呼　復工，保留一切問題，從緩解决一舉，已顯然使罷工者問發生裂痕。紐約　資堡芝加哥等處之鋼鐵工廠，凡曾罷工者，均已於週二復工，一般人雖相信鋼　糾粉，已吿結束，但其他工廠仍求復工。</p>

<h3>基洛伏格勒迤北　德軍防禦戰順利　基輔西兩軍展開坦克大戰</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：星期一日德軍在基洛伏格勒之北不顧蘇軍之頑抗冒險猛攻，而獲得重要之勝利，德步兵與戰車分隊在突擊中深入蘇軍前綫凸出處，將德軍陣綫向東移動，因而使戰綫大見縮短。勤契薩之西北德軍進攻續有進展，蘇軍雖加强抵抗亦無效，敵企圖以反攻阻止德軍之前進，但此種企圖均為德軍之流動砲隊與猛攻砲所抑阻。在齊托密爾之冬季爭奪大戰中，蘇軍命令其基輔至齊托密爾公路以南之坦克車主力編隊，向南方與東南穿破德軍之戰綫，當即展開　口之坦克車大戰，但德守軍採用彈性戰術，終於攔截蘇軍之前進，而阻止其一突破，以前為敵所包圍之德軍若干編隊，已携同武器與軍備返歸本軍之陣綫。</p>
<p>柏林廿九日中央社電　據海通社軍事記者塞托留斯稱：蘇軍於星期一續向維特勃斯克方面集中進攻，遭遇德軍堅强之抵抗，敵軍之正面攻勢似不甚猛烈，惟其側面壓力殊大，德軍之反攻已將敵軍之側面攻勢遏　，激戰現在進行中。同時蘇將伐吐丁於聖誕夜在泰特列夫以西發動之大攻勢，業已擴展至柯洛斯頓齊托密爾。貝迪契夫區，貝迪契夫（在齊托密爾之南）似為敵方之主要目標。</p>
<h3>反軸心軍事活動　殆為侵歐先聲　德軍事家之觀測</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　據海通社軍事記者塞托留斯稱：艾森霍華將軍之被任為攻歐軍總司令，以及羅斯福總統之預言將有血戰，尙不足以示進攻西歐業已迫在眉睫，蓋兩事均為一種政治上與心理上之準備，以助羅斯福本人之參加四屆總統競選而已。惟近來數種軍事上之行動，堪為反軸心軍攻歐之先聲，例如敵空軍之加緊轟炸海峽沿岸德方要聯，英國南部船雙之集中，及英國交通之趨於活躍，且蘇聯之冬季攻勢，業已開始，而進攻西歐固頗有與其相呼應之可能也。敵方之計劃似須俟蘇軍之冬季攻勢已吸引德軍後備軍主力至東綫助戰後，始發動攻歐，以便乘虛進襲。然無論如何，東西兩攻勢發動之距離决不致甚畏，且敵方亦深知處於內綫作戰之一方，利在實行各個擊破之計劃，故敵人似不致予德國以此一機會，然則進攻西歐為期當巳不遠矣。</p>
<h3>法四北小島　英登陸未逞</h3>
<p>柏林廿九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，軍息：英方特組登陸部隊日昨企圖由海峽中鄰近法西北部沙爾克Ｓａｒｋ小島登陸，但未成功，此為三日以來英方第二次之同樣企圖。當敵軍駛近該島沙灘時，即聞重爆炸聲數饗，旋即見火光熊熊，意者地雷已顯其效力，經過調查後，始知不出所料，且發現炸斃之英兵一名，德防軍並無行動之必要。</p>
<p>柏林廿九日中央社電　德國新聞社自權威方面獲悉，德輕艦隊與英海軍部隊，布比斯開　交鋒業已數日，空軍部隊亦加入作戰，雙方皆有損傷，準備加入作戰之英巡艦一艘被擊中，受創甚重，當即駛離該處。</p>
<h3>特戈爾軍隊　將參加作戰</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　據阿爾及爾消息：與阿爾及爾委員會接近之人士本日暗示，塔西尼將軍即將被委統率特戈爾派部隊參加艾森霍華將軍所統之反軸心進攻西歐部隊，據云塔氏雖被委為遠征軍司令，但仍受季勞將軍之節制。</p>
<h3>直港動態</h3>
<p>瑪德里二十九日中央社電　據本日此間消息：護航隊一大隊自大西洋某處駛抵直布羅陀，計有船隻七十七艘，其中大多數為萬噸之輪船，另一護航隊，有船約二十艘已駛離直港，向地中海方面駛去。</p>
<h3>土駐英大使　返國述職</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十九日中央社電　據海通社訊，倫敦消息：土耳其駐英大使奧卑已啓程回安加拉，向政府述職，預料其離英為短甚短。</p>
<h3>土國會通過　增加國防費</h3>
<p>期丹埠二十九日中士國會日昨（星期二）通過土政府要求非常國防費一三〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇土鎊之議案。</p>

<h3>印度內部的不安</h3>
<p>雨季過去後，江特拉·鮑斯氏所率領印度國民軍進攻的消息流傳着，同時，英美渝合作在印度的軍事行動，漸趨熾烈。繼東甫亞洲聯合軍司令部的設置以後，有開羅會談，更有麥克沃塞，蒙特巴頓在德里的會見等，要人來往不絕，驅使印度大陸成為反軸心陣綫的要塞。使印度拿起他們所不願意拿的刀槍，把三億八千萬民衆打入狂瀾，飢餓，和重壓的深淵。在英美帝國主義操縱下的德里廣播，用虛偽的誇大宣傳遮瞞民衆的耳目。軍用米的徵發，在飢餓民衆達二百萬的犧牲上，强制推進。但另一方面，印度國民軍在東亞前進的消息，雖被掩瞞，也漸漸地滲透在民衆之問，促進國內前衛派之活潑的秘密遝動，尤其在軍隊內部，急不及待的叛軍已達十萬，僅賴金錢與强權支配的組織系統，正在動搖戰慄中。除觀望的各政派之低調的行動外，民衆亟欲脫離其生活本身的重壓和不安，對英國帝國主義支配的叛變，一觸即發。茲試解剖以印度為舞臺而狂舞的英，美，渝軍事合作之實情，並觀察政治季節到來時漸趨活潑的國內各政派之動向，及全印度所視為生死問題的食糧問題及此後的進展。</p>
<p>最先値得注目者，乃西南太平洋，東南亞洲二軍之接近的計劃。參謀長薩柴蘭少將和蒙特巴頓，及麥克沃塞和蒙特巴頓在德里的會見，說明了敵方的總反攻作戰極為積極，并暗示在其規模上也有若干變更。</p>
<p>敵軍企圖從海上進攻</p>
<p>敵軍業已公佈在北部緬甸及阿拉貢和日軍接觸，除此陸上反攻以外，企圖從海上進攻奪還緬甸，大家也都已知道了。訓練「奇襲登陸部隊」的蒙特巴頓，在西南太平洋聯合軍的諒解之下，擬開始蠢動的企圖，愈見濃化。</p>
<p>最近美國增大在印度的軍事力之比率，確為事實。本年春阿拉貢戰役時所指出的美國對印度發言權之增加，今已無可諱飾。配置於阿薩姆的渝軍，由美國供給其裝備並訓練。而尤堪注目者，全世界最長的美印間定期航空綫之</p>
<p>這航空綫從俄亥俄州橫斷大西洋，從地中海經土耳其到達印度加拉奇，全部行程需時八日。這是因為澳洲航空綫被日軍封鎖，乃在經由澳洲，北非的空路之外，另設一條新綫。這新聞空綫究有何種效果，實為疑問。其主要目標，除為充實將官級的指揮系統，並謀飛機本身的　送外，更　運輸印度所不能生產的發動機，而組織美印空軍。</p>
<p>增强移駐印度渝軍</p>
<p>這樣，因北非，地中海的變貌，使妄思制覇世界的美國，欲驅使無辜的印度民衆堂握在自己支配下的企圖，愈見露骨。在這動向上堪予注目者，乃增强移駐印度的渝軍。敵方先前會發表越過雲南的天險，由中印空路遣送約〇萬兵士至北阿薩姆，經美軍將校訓練，並由美國供給裝備，而配置於進攻所謂新阿薩姆。緬甸路錢。最近且更予增强。在英美的不逞企圖上活躍的渝軍，現在正出動到重開「新阿薩姆路綫」的最前錢上。這徒供紙上談兵的犧牲。汲汲於擁護自已政權的蔣介石，終於把自己的軍隊置於美軍的支配下，使留駐於遙遠的異域，在東亞的歷史上留下了一大汚點。</p>
<p>敵方所宣傳的新阿柴姆。緬甸路綫之詳情，尙未明瞭，大約係指以前的結隊商人所經的路綫，而為侵略雲南的英軍所構築的北緬甸的駝馬路。要開闢這條路綫的希望，即將成為泡影，恐怕一兵一卒也不能越過怒江。</p>
<p>據說蒙特巴頓伴同開羅會談歸來的蔣介石夫婦檢閱印度駐屯部隊。這裏可見敵方恐怕重慶脫離的預防策。先前德里廣播報吿推戴宋美　為加爾各答飢饉救濟委員會的名譽幹事，更稱重慶所送的五百萬盧比救濟義金業已到達。實際上此款名義上雖係重慶政權支出，到後來用强制分配的方法從民衆方面徵收。重慶。印度合作的狂態，完全由美英的策略所指使。</p>
<p>如是，因美軍比重的增加，渝軍的移駐。配置於東印度國境的兵力，已達相當的數量。東印度最近的情報，並又新添了非洲的黑人兵，且重視庫爾加兵。</p>
<p>先前歐慶萊克曾視察彭恰布州，繼在十一月末，華維爾又視察西北國境州。這些事實，表敵人怎樣重視庫爾加兵，怎樣想大量集結喜馬拉耶國境的人民。</p>
<p>印度軍隊的逃亡</p>
<p>現在印度軍隊內部，因農產物漲價，意欲歸農而逃亡的兵士，日有數起。同時，長官暴行，竊盜，收賄等卑劣事件，蔓延頗廣。英美軍幹部為辦理此等事件，遇到了意料之外的困難。在這種情勢中，堪予注目者，為錫蘭島的軍事基地化。最近為强化和印度本國的運輸聯絡，正進行收買已達飽和狀態的南印度鐵道的手續，竭力强化軍事運輸。印度的軍事基地强化之後，顯然將對國內政派，尤其是前衛派，加以猛烈的彈壓，洩露於外面的印度政情之行動是低調的，全印安特拉·瑪哈薩巴舉行大會，繼之，全印度回敎徒聯盟興斯·馬哈薩巴亦各舉行大會，以迎政洽季節的到來。此中具有影響力的回敎聯盟，依然表示對英接近。</p>
<p>事實上，各州的向聯立運動前進的可能性相當强烈，因此，似有向興斯馬哈薩巴聯絡的模樣。如是，因琴那負傷事件的結果，興斯馬哈薩巴的總裁柴巴加爾表示辭意，故大體上可以說持着親英的傾向。但我們以為趨向回敎聯盟的傾向未必能够成功。要之，聯立內閣的第一步，不能不先從調查人口開始·皮哈魯，奧利薩，阿薩姆等地回敎，興斯敎徒之數字的比率，未必已經調查淸楚。</p>
<p>此外有拉恰科帕拉却利耶運動」，即所謂獄外派的觀望主義者運動，現在正暗中活動，其他小黨派的活動則還不脫低調的地步。華維爾視為時尙早，還不見有何政治的行動，但各派的低調的活動中，獨有前衛派的暗中運動，遍佈全印，將愈趨强烈。繼續不斷的恐怖及罷工運動之波及，正說明了此種潛勢。糾合以革命為目標的各派精銳而組成的各地方·區·都市的委員會，亦設有分隊，由訓練過的人員展開怠工運動。鮑斯氏的國外運動成熱的機運，正在積極釀成中。</p>
<p>這種動盪中最感興味者是甘地夫人的獄中罹病。現在如無釋放的形勢，則預料即將發生不測波瀾。</p>
<p>食糧問題的嚴重</p>
<p>最後再看遍及全印的食糧問題。英美軍雖曾予以救援，但範圍不大，杯水車薪，無濟於事，依然不脫深刻的飢饉狀態。物價方面，食料品漲七倍，一般物價五倍。市中黑市公然橫行，最近更波及到燃料，搶煤者白畫當路行刧。燃料不足，使各廠減縮工作，引起罷工，運輸大感困難，食糧飢　愈見嚴重，而刺激物價的騰漲。</p>
<p>印度事務大臣阿梅里在議會中發表印度政廳每日供膳者達二百萬人。但現在那支票不能兌現，暫吿中止。僅專事發表澳洲的小麥船到達，或軍隊協力等空洞的話，以欺瞞民衆。</p>
<p>總之，英美渝合作的印度要塞，在其根本上和印度本身的耍求相反，因而遭遇許多困難，缺乏精神的結合。此等事件正說明了印度未來的運命。（翔：譯自十二月十八日西部瑚日新聞）</p>

<h3>流民習勤</h3>
<p>世界紅　字會經辦之上海流民習勤所，成立半載，收容流民五百餘名，授以拔藝，使之生產。昨日該所招待各界參觀，並展覽流民生產品，以期引起社會人士之注意。</p>
<p>「流民」是社會上的純　　分子，是分利分子，說得嚴格一點，是人類的渣滓。如何使不能生產的流民，收容訓練，使成為生產分子，這是當局與社會人士共同的義務，也是共同的責任。現在是戰時，是需要增加生產之時，是節約消費之時，尤其需要一方面使用最大的人力，而一方面節約最大的物力，所以，使純消費的流民，習藝而成為生產分子，是多麽迫切需要的社會工作。</p>
<p>上海流民習勤所，就是担任這一工作者，在客觀上是十分重要的。該所辦理雖僅半載，而成績已頗可觀，更證明這工作的切合需要與對社會的幫助。</p>
<p>我們盼望政府當局與社會熱心人士，重視「流民習勤」對於增加生產，節約消費，以及社會觀瞻的重要性，共同出錢出力，協助上海流民習動所擴展工作，必要時設立分所，使全市沒有一個流民，使每一個流民都成為生產分子。</p>
<h3>市民節約會　今改組成立</h3>
<p>上海市民節約運動會，經該會第四次理監事會通過，决定改組更名為上海特別市節約協會，會址仍設大上海路（愛多亞路）一六〇號三樓，內部人事並無重大更動，改組成立大會，定今日（三十日）上午十一時假寗波同鄕會舉行，凡屬該會會員，均可自由參加，並無限制，屆時社會福利部部長丁默村氏，將躬親出席，大會主席為張一鵬。</p>
<h3>舞廳營業時間　縮短一小時</h3>
<p>中央社訊　本市青少年學生為響應首都青年學生禁絕烟賭　運動，曾於前（二十七）日舉行正義示威遊行，全市各舞廳當奉令停業，茲悉第一警察憶對各舞廳，決予整頓，規定於今日起，每晚營業時間一小時，每晚營業　　至十一時均須打烊，一面令飭各該管分局調查舞廳現况，呈報核奪。</p>
<p>舞廳職工請願復工</p>
<p>又本市各舞廳奉令停業後，全體職工舞女三千餘人，昨（二十九）晨至第一局請願復業，以維生計，並推派代表晉謁蘇副局長，當由蘇副局長偕趙主任秘書呂行政處長接見，對禁意義詳加　述，姑念員工生計，暫准復定。惟營業時間須予縮短，並對青少年學生之宣傳工作，須予合作，不得阻撓。</p>
<p>經濟辦　評言</p>
<h3>再言消費特稅</h3>
<p>前日論戰時消費特稅，認為是調劑戰時財政的最良政策，而對於人民公衆有百害而無一利之消費事項，有如烟賭舞等等，則常科以無可再苛的特稅，則雖不能於俄頃之問，剷除盡聲，尙得寓禁於徵，至於與人民日常生活有關之一切商品，在現時物價　騰，民生凋敝之秋，自應於徵收特稅之中，不忘體念民生之意，換句話說，就是要兼籌並顯，方為合理。</p>
<p>據前日稅務當局解答中央社記者之問，則關於零售稅稅率，决定從價徵收百分之四，而主要糧食必需之商品，則一律免徵稅收，如此看來，當局確能於徵收戰時消費特稅之中，顧慮到現時人民生活之困苦，祗是一般不顧商人道德者，又復藉詞於徵收消費特稅，任意高抬物價，其藉詞加價三成至四五成者，正不知包括幾許人民日常生活必需之商品，影響幾多朝夕掙扎於最低生活水準上的人民。特稅尙未開徵，而物價抬高之比率，竟已十倍於新稅之稅率，這是公佈戰時消費特稅聲中一假最嚴重的現象，急切有待於稅務當局的剴切聲明，統制當局的嚴厲取締，方可以毋負人民繳納戰時消費特稅的義務。</p>
<h3>銀行公會昨　舉行會員大會　修改會章遞補理事</h3>
<p>上海特別市銀行業同業公會，於昨（二十九）日下午三時半，舉行第十四屆會員大會，出席者各理監事及一百七十家銀行會員代表二百餘人，由常務理事葉扶　主席，及該會林秘書長康侯報吿半年來（即六個月）會務，當經</p>

<p>會務報告</p>
<p>林秘書長報吿，略謂：六閱月中，政府頒布關於金融事業之法令，約有數端，此中尤以修正銀行註冊章程關係重要，蓋以往銀錢業資本有在百萬元以下者，依照現行修正法令，至少總額達六百萬元，如果兼營儒蓋及信托業務，尚須各　足資本二百萬元，以是新　銀行，多數必須辦理增資，期限亦規定以本年底為止，本會以各行荘或有趕辦不及，乃與錢業　街呈請屬期六個月，近奉　示展至三十三年三月底為止。半年以來上海金融市塲，大體尚稱穩定，此際本會聯合準備會，曾修訂同業拆放辦法，此外又如政府實施收買紗布與同業不無有抵押間接關係，因函請商統會設定質權，並通吿各行如期趕辦，又由銀行學會修訂改善倉單過戶辦法，通吿各行荘收受而約備蓄存款，辦理有獎定期存款，規定取缔遠期本　辦法，推定修改章程業規小組委員等項，自七月份起先後申請入會銀行有十八家，截至目前，會員達一百七十家，代表六百二十二人云。</p>
<p>修改會章</p>

<h3>粉麥委員會　暫停收買小麥</h3>
<p>中央社訊　商統會粉麥專業委員會，為調整收買小麥技術工作，决定調整步驟未完成前，暫行停止收買小麥，昨特由該會負責人發表談話云：本委員會為使粉麥業者健全發展，努力增產，充裕民食起見，曾經　訂小麥莧買方案，核定產地小麥價格，每百市斤三百五十元。同時規定粉麩價格，以期原料及製品之價値，得以平衡。數月以來，承主管當局指導，業者協力，工作順利，差堪吿慰。乃近因一般物價刺激，致小麥價格陡漲，採辦原料，深感困難，唯本委員會對於前項核定之小麥收買價格，決予維持，迭經聲明。蓋麵粉亦為主要民食，設原料一經增加，粉價勢必提高，直接影響民生，兼及一般物價，關係　細，本委員會目七月初起，開始收買，迄今已六閱月，收獲成績，均達預定數量，所製粉麩，除充華巾民食外，特需方面，旣已完全繳納，即華北及其他地區之預定輸出，亦已達十分之八。現在各麵粉廠，多數尙有存貨，自無提高小麥收買價格之必要。茲本會為遂行方案，完遂物價穩定政策，並增加收買效率起見，對於小麥收買技術方面，已擬具更進一步之新計劃，在實行計　之前，將收買工作，暫行停頓。至大麥元麥，前因特　關係，曾經指定委托商收買，收數已達相當數　，暫時亦停止採購，惟麥類均係統制物資，決不准予自由移動，任意囤積。</p>
<p>小型機廠管理辦法</p>
<p>再本會對於小型機廠，及石磨粉坊，亦已擬具管理辦法，呈准商統會公布施行，現正舉辦登記手續，今後關於會員各廠電力之支配，悉歸本會審核，轉請盟華中電力公司執行。對於一般協力統制之業者，將與當局協議，配給粉　布袋煤炭機油及收買資金等，予以充分之援助，一切方策均在計劃進行，以期對於充裕民食，穩定物價，稍盡棉薄，庶不負本會創立之初衷耳。</p>

<h3>上海流民習勤所　工作概況</h3>
<p>（一）籌備經過　該所自民國三十一年十一月起着手籌備，迭經與市區當局聯席會議，決定各項組織辦法，及分担經費數目所址，經商假漕河經遊民習勤所　址，因個中發生種種　　，幾經商治，至本年二月間始獲就緒，隨經着手與工修　，並分別裝置設備，迨本年五月二十八日，開始收容。</p>
<p>（二）組織大綱　該所管理與執行問題，前經各市區當局議定，由各市區當局聯合組織上海流民習勤所管理委員會，設委員九人，互惟正副主席委員各一人，綜理一切所務。該會則組織上海流民習勤所，執行委員會，冠以世界紅　字會經辦八字，經公推當務委員十一人，再由常務委員互推主任委員副主任委員各一人，執行一切事宜，並聘請各界名流為名譽委員。此外附設總務　設主任一人，副主任二人，又組織財務組訓育組衛生組工藝組收容道散組各委員會，聘請專門人才擔任各組委員。</p>
<p>（三）收集辦法　此項流民之收集前經市區當局議定標準及人數，由各區市政機關分區派　於街頭收集，不分男女，其年齡以十八歲至四十五歲為合格。但遇患有神經病傳染病花柳病及吸食鴉片白粉者，均不得收入，至各市區送入流民之數，即依照各市區所認捐款比例而定，以六四三分配之。凡各市區收集流民未經送所時，先行通知該會，遴派醫師前往會同檢驗，認為可送所者，再行送所收容。收容人數暫定一千名，上海特別市政應送三百〇八名，第一區（前工部局）應分送四百六十一名，第八區（前法公　局）應分送二百三十一名，自開始收容以來，除不合收容規定者陸續剔退及具保自　出所者外，實收流民五百二十六人。</p>
<p>（四）訓育方針，訓育流民與其他教育不能同例而言，大率懶惰成性，不專生產，甚至有以乞討為樂，自甘　　而不悔者。收集人所之後，若不加以有紀律之訓育道德之感化，頗不易變更其習慣，然其中亦不乏學師範及中學人才，與夫具有機器電氣扶輪紡織縫紉雜藝諸技能者，該所則察其品性稍覺純真者，　為該所職員，或提充助理技師，此外俟國訓育有成亦可漸變為社會有用之才，茲將實施訓育撮要列后：</p>

        <h1>1943.12.30</h1>
<h3>Prospects for the 84th Japanese Diet Session</h3>
<p>The 84th session of the Japanese Diet was convened at the House of Peers at 10:00 AM on the 26th of this month. On the 27th, after passing a resolution thanking the Emperor for his address and resolutions of gratitude to the Army and Navy, the Diet adjourned for the remainder of the year, with a scheduled reconvening for a plenary session on January 21st of next year. This session of the Japanese Diet coincides with a period when the world war is advancing towards a decisive stage. It also follows the victory in the naval and air battles around Bougainville Island. The Japanese people are in a state of extreme excitement and tension, and the main task of the Diet is to promote national unity to win the war.</p>
<p>As the decisive battle situation becomes increasingly significant, there are unlimited expectations for the 84th Diet session, which will resume in late January next year. Prime Minister Tojo, in his report on the war situation on the 27th, clearly pointed out the most important direction for the Japanese people's efforts: "What must be particularly noted now is the importance of reinforcing the war effort, with the focus on the production and transportation of resources." (Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th) This is the core of the "strengthening the domestic decisive battle posture" movement that Japan has been intensifying in recent months, and also the main content of the budget and legislative bills that will be decided upon when the Diet reconvenes. According to Prime Minister Tojo's report, the production of resources has seen considerable progress due to the enthusiastic cooperation of the entire Japanese nation, with aircraft production significantly increased. In terms of transportation, "no regrets can be expected" due to close cooperation with the Navy and the efforts of the people in the rear. In the future, when the 84th Diet session continues to deliberate on the budget and other legislative bills, it will surely enable the strengthening measures for the domestic decisive battle posture to achieve even greater results.</p>
<p>Recently, enemy propaganda based on their strategies, from the Cairo Conference declarations regarding Japan to the so-called encirclement and counter-offensive posture against Germany since the Tehran Conference, all indicate that the future situation will become increasingly severe. However, this kind of propaganda is not enough to shake the Axis powers, especially the allied nation of Japan, in the slightest. Prime Minister Tojo said plainly in his report to the Diet: "The enemy's anxiety and hasty attempt to counter-attack is self-evident, which is a good opportunity for us to destroy the enemy. Therefore, this attitude of the enemy is actually beneficial to us." Therefore, he hoped that "all military personnel and civilians will firmly believe in victory, display a strong spirit of attack, and advance resolutely in the war with unwavering determination." We firmly believe that the 84th session of the Japanese Diet, which will reconvene on January 21st, will make a significant contribution to strengthening the overall goal of "all Japanese united in mind to achieve the war objectives."</p>
<p>Because we have entered the decisive stage of the war, we must strengthen our domestic posture to win. To strengthen the domestic posture, we must obtain the cooperation of the entire population. Japan deeply feels this need, so after each Diet session, there is a tangible manifestation of strengthening the domestic posture. Since the Greater East Asia Conference, Japan's mission has become even greater: on the one hand, to defeat the enemy's counter-offensive; on the other hand, to implement the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Therefore, after this Diet session, we will see even greater cooperation between the Japanese government and people to strengthen the domestic posture. Looking back at our country's participation in the war in recent years, our mission is the same as that of our allies. However, our work in promoting cooperation between the government and the people and strengthening the domestic posture lags far behind. We have not even established a popular institution similar to the Japanese Diet to promote cooperation between the government and the people. However, the task of participating in the war cannot be shirked. We hope that the government and the public will pay attention to this and unite and cooperate as soon as possible to strengthen the wartime posture, jointly strive for victory, and fulfill the obligation to implement the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration.</p>
<h3>Glorious Air Battle at Rabaul: Japanese Naval Air Force Achieves Victory, US Forces Forced to Retreat from Aloei Front</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 29th: Our naval air units encountered approximately 50 attacking enemy fighters near Rabaul on the 28th and shot down 31 of them (including 10 unconfirmed). Our losses were 3 aircraft that did not return.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - After enemy forces established bridgeheads in the southwest and northwest of New Britain Island, they suffered great losses due to relentless bombing by Japanese aircraft. However, their ambition to seize Rabaul has not been easily abandoned, so they have repeatedly attacked Rabaul and Japanese bases in that area for days. At dawn on the 28th, 50 enemy fighters attacked Rabaul again. The Japanese naval fighter squadron immediately intercepted them, and after a fierce air battle, shot down 31 enemy planes, accounting for six-tenths of the attacking enemy planes. This demonstrates the bravery of the Japanese air force. On the 27th, the Japanese air force intercepted 50 enemy planes over Rabaul, shooting down 23 of them. The Japanese only lost 3 planes in that battle. Since the enemy planes landed at Magas Corner on the 15th, up to the 28th, approximately 519 enemy planes have attacked, of which 182 were shot down by the Japanese naval air squadron, nearly one-third of the total number of enemy planes.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 29th - According to a report from the anti-Axis base on New Guinea Island: The Southwest Pacific anti-Axis command announced on the 28th that the advanced units of the US forces in that area were forced to retreat from the outposts near Aloei due to a fierce counter-offensive launched by the Japanese garrison at Magas Corner from three directions.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - According to a report from a certain South Pacific base, the enemy attacked Buin and Shortland Island on Bougainville Island on the 28th with approximately 100 carrier-based aircraft and bombers. The Japanese naval air squadron immediately intercepted them, shooting down 4 planes. Japanese losses were minimal.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - According to a report from a certain South Pacific base, the Japanese naval air force raided the Finschhafen enemy airfield on New Guinea Island on the night of the 28th. Two locations were hit and caught fire, and another location had flames rising into the air. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army's Winter Offensive Achieves Significant Results, Adopting Blitzkrieg Tactics</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Hankou, 29th - The Japanese Central China Army's winter offensive operation, which began on November 2nd, has been progressing with the force of a raging tide. Within a vast area of 300 kilometers east-west and several hundred kilometers north-south, it fiercely attacked the Sixth War Area of Chongqing, destroying ten armies, totaling 28 divisions, and completely annihilating them. The central area of Chongqing's defense has achieved great results, completely achieving the goal of shattering Chongqing's defense capabilities. The Japanese operational forces resumed their original posture on December 25th.</p>
<p>Implementing Inland Offensive Operations</p>
<p>This time, the Japanese army used blitzkrieg tactics to implement inland offensive operations. It was not an attempt to seize a city or town, but to shatter the combat power of the Chongqing army and annihilate the Chongqing army's defensive positions near Changde, so as to completely destroy the root of Chongqing's resistance, the Sixth War Area. Therefore, the blow to the Chongqing camp was very heavy. The Japanese army destroyed 28 divisions of the Chongqing army, and annihilated the defensive positions built near Changde, which took several years and cost hundreds of millions. This is enough to show the world the strong combat power of the Japanese army. The Sixth War Area of Chongqing, south of Changde, has almost no reserves. The Chongqing army completely lost the ability to block the Japanese army's breakthrough. In order to rescue Changde, they sent reinforcements twice from the Ninth War Area of Chongqing and the Nanchang area. The first time, the 10th, 99th, 100th, and 3rd armies of Chongqing were annihilated by the Japanese army in the southern region of Changde. The second time, the Provisional 2nd, 59th, and 72nd armies of Chongqing also feared the power of the Japanese army. The Japanese army used skillful operations to destroy them everywhere, and ultimately did not allow the Chongqing army to achieve the goal of rescuing Changde. Also, the annihilating battle that broke through the Changde defense line, after unfolding over a vast area for two months, has hinted that capturing Chongqing is not impossible.</p>
<p>Large Number of Cannons Among Captured Goods</p>
<p>In addition, there is another special point, that is, the number of cannons captured among the spoils of war has increased compared to past operations, totaling about 158 mountain guns, rapid-firing guns, and mortars. This is a significant increase compared to the past. For example, in the First Changsha Operation, there were 70 cannons, in the Second Changsha Operation, there were 85 cannons, in the Yichang Operation, there were more than 40 cannons, in the Dabie Mountains Operation, there were 6 cannons, in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Operation, there were 130 cannons, and in the Jiangnan Annihilation Operation, there were 90 cannons. There are two main reasons why the Japanese army captured such a large number of weapons: one is that the Japanese army implemented blitzkrieg encirclement and a sudden attack on the Chongqing army; the other is that it implemented a thorough invasion of the interior and came into contact with the elite Chongqing army, annihilating them.</p>
<p>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Battle Results</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM on the 29th that our army units have been operating in the western region of Dongting Lake since November 2nd, destroying the main force of the Chongqing army in the Sixth and Ninth War Areas, which are the roots of Chongqing's resistance, and completely destroying the Chongqing military facilities near the key point of Changde in that area. Our operational forces, after fully achieving their intended objectives, resumed their original posture on December 25th. The comprehensive results of this operation are as follows: The damage inflicted on the Chongqing army includes the bodies of 32,747 Chongqing soldiers recovered, and 14,325 prisoners captured. Near Changde, 60 enemy planes were shot down. The main captured goods include 158 cannons, 657 heavy machine guns, 6,356 rifles, and 2.36 million rounds of various bullets. Our losses include 1,666 killed in action.</p>
<h3>Capital Youth's Grand Rally: Director-General Lin Attends and Delivers Instructions</h3>

<p>Qing Hu General Association Calls a Meeting</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th - The Capital Youth Student Qing Hu (Eradicate Poison) Movement General Association, in order to expand its work and promote persuasion, has decided to hold an expanded publicity campaign from January 1st next year to the anniversary of joining the war on the 9th.

<p>(Another news) The General Association recently hired many government officials to serve as advisors and instructors to the association in order to enhance meeting efficiency and promote the healthy development of association affairs.</p>
<p>Student Qing Hu Movement Measures</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th - Mr. Lin Baisheng, Director-General of the Chinese Youth Corps and Director of the Chinese Youth Model Library, in order to enable the anti-drug movement initiated by youth and students in various places to further exert its active and constructive nature, and to gather strength to achieve complete success as soon as possible, has specially formulated measures and sent them to the provincial and municipal corps headquarters of the Chinese Youth Corps, and the joint team headquarters and directly affiliated team headquarters of the Chinese Youth Model Corps.

<h3>Reasons for the Resignation of Chen Cheng, Commander of the Yunnan-Chongqing Army</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th - The reason for the resignation of Chen Cheng, the supreme commander in Yunnan, is said to be that when the Japanese army was fighting on the Nu River, Lord Mountbatten, commander of the Southeast Asia Command, adopted a lukewarm attitude, watching the Chongqing army fall into difficulties and doing nothing to help, which angered Chen Cheng. Above the air, it was prepared to intercept, and the Japanese aircraft immediately engaged in fierce fighting with it. After about 20 minutes, eight Chongqing aircraft were shot down (one of which was not confirmed), and seven North American P25 aircraft, two P40 aircraft, and one P40 aircraft parked on the ground were bombed and caught fire. At the same time, five P25 aircraft were destroyed by bombing. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their original defense area.</p>

<h3>North of Kirovograd, German Defensive Battles Proceed Smoothly, Large Tank Battles Unfold West of Kyiv</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th - German News Agency Report: On Sunday, the German army north of Kirovograd disregarded the stubborn resistance of the Soviet army and launched a daring offensive, achieving an important victory. German infantry and tank detachments penetrated deep into the salient of the Soviet front during the assault, moving the German front line eastward, thereby greatly shortening the front line. Northwest of Kryvyi Rih, German advances continued to progress. Although the Soviet army strengthened its resistance, it was ineffective. The enemy attempted to stop the German advance with a counter-offensive, but these attempts were suppressed by the German mobile artillery units and assault guns. During the winter struggle for Zhytomyr, the Soviet army ordered its main tank formation south of the Kyiv-Zhytomyr highway to break through the German line to the south and southeast, immediately unfolding a large-scale tank battle at the mouth. However, the German defenders adopted elastic tactics and finally intercepted the Soviet advance, preventing a breakthrough. Some German units that had previously been surrounded by the enemy have returned to their own line with weapons and equipment.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th - According to Havas' military reporter, Sextus, the Soviet army continued to concentrate its offensive on Vitebsk on Monday, encountering strong German resistance. The enemy's frontal offensive did not seem very fierce, but its flank pressure was significant. The German counter-offensive has contained the enemy's flank offensive, and fierce fighting is now underway. At the same time, the large-scale offensive launched by Soviet General Vatutin west of Teterev on Christmas Eve has expanded to Korosten and Zhytomyr. The Berdychiv area (south of Zhytomyr) seems to be the enemy's main target.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Military Activities Are Mostly a Prelude to the Invasion of Europe, Observations of German Military Experts</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th - According to Havas' military reporter, Sextus, General Eisenhower's appointment as the Supreme Commander of the European invasion force, and President Roosevelt's prediction of bloody battles, are not enough to indicate that the invasion of Western Europe is imminent. Both events are a political and psychological preparation to help Roosevelt himself participate in the fourth presidential election. However, several recent military actions can be seen as a prelude to the anti-Axis invasion of Europe, such as the enemy air force's intensified bombing of key German coastal positions along the English Channel, the concentration of ships in southern England, the increased activity of British transportation, and the start of the Soviet winter offensive. The invasion of Western Europe is likely to correspond with it. The enemy's plan seems to be to wait until the Soviet winter offensive has attracted the main force of the German reserve army to the Eastern Front to assist in the fighting, and then launch an invasion of Europe to take advantage of the weakness. In any case, the distance between the launching of the eastern and western offensives will not be too far, and the enemy is also well aware that the advantage of one side fighting on the inner line lies in implementing a strategy of defeating the enemy one by one. Therefore, the enemy is unlikely to give Germany this opportunity, so the invasion of Western Europe must be imminent.</p>
<h3>British Landing on Four Small French Islands Fails</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th - German News Agency Report, Military News: British special landing forces attempted to land on Sark Island near northwestern France in the English Channel yesterday, but were unsuccessful. This is the second similar attempt by the British in three days. When the enemy approached the beaches of the island, they heard several heavy explosions, followed by raging flames. It was thought that the landmines had shown their effectiveness. After investigation, it was found to be the case, and the body of one British soldier was found. The German defense forces did not need to take action.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th - The German News Agency has learned from authoritative sources that the German light fleet and British naval units have been engaged in combat in the Bay of Biscay for several days. Air force units have also joined the battle. Both sides have suffered damage. A British cruiser that was preparing to join the battle was hit and severely damaged, and immediately left the area.</p>
<h3>Troops Under General Teggor Will Participate in Combat</h3>

It is said that although Tassi has been appointed commander of the expeditionary force, he is still under the control of General Giraud.</p>
<h3>Developments at Gibraltar</h3>

<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th - German Headquarters announced: On the 27th of the Southern Italian front, only the western sector saw localized fighting. Anti-Axis forces attacked north of Venafro with superior forces. After fierce fighting, the German army lost a high ground. In the eastern Ortona area, after severely damaging the anti-Axis forces in the past few days of fighting, the German army retreated from Ortona, which had been reduced to ruins, and defended new positions in the northwestern suburbs of the city.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rome, 29th - German News Agency Report, according to the London Times: Anti-Axis bombers dropped heavy bombs on the outskirts of Rome at noon yesterday.

<h3>The Greater East Asia Construction Review Committee Passes Two Important Proposals: Increasing Food Production and Fiber Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Greater East Asia Construction Review Committee held its eighth general meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 28th at 2:00 PM. Prime Minister Tojo, in his capacity as president, along with various cabinet members and committee members, discussed and responded to consultation proposals regarding measures for increasing food production in the Greater East Asia region and measures for increasing the production of fiber raw materials in the Greater East Asia region. The proposals were unanimously passed by all attendees, and the meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 29th the following key points regarding the policy outline for increasing the production of renewable raw materials, to be discussed at the Greater East Asia Construction Review Committee's general meeting in December of this year:</p>
<p>The summary of the food production increase policy in the Greater East Asia region is as follows: Food production in the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be increased to accommodate the growing population within the sphere. The fundamental aim is to ensure the Greater East Asia region's ability to navigate the current situation by increasing food self-sufficiency in various regions within the Co-Prosperity Sphere. In the regions centered around Japan and Manchuria, an emergency increase in food production will be implemented, aiming for complete food self-sufficiency. Therefore, detailed strategies will be implemented in each region regarding major food plans and aquatic and livestock production plans.</p>
<p>The summary of the raw material production increase policy in the Greater East Asia region is as follows: Regarding the comprehensive increase in fiber raw materials in Greater East Asia, a resolute effort will be made to ensure the successful completion of the Greater East Asia War and to thoroughly implement a policy of self-sufficiency in fiber resources. For cotton, hemp, silk, wool, and various other fiber resources, comprehensive plans for Greater East Asia and individual plans for each region will be established, and detailed production increase plans will be implemented based on the type of fiber resource.</p>

<h3>Unease Within India</h3>
<p>Since the end of the rainy season, news of the advance of the Indian National Army led by Chandra Bose has been circulating. Simultaneously, the joint military operations of Britain, America, and Chongqing in India have intensified. Following the establishment of the United Southeast Asian Command, there was the Cairo Conference, and then the meetings between Mountbatten and Wedemeyer in Delhi. Important figures have been arriving constantly, turning the Indian continent into a fortress for the anti-Axis front, forcing India to take up weapons it did not want to, and plunging 380 million people into a maelstrom of hunger and oppression. The Delhi radio, under the control of Anglo-American imperialism, uses deceptive propaganda to conceal the truth from the people. The requisition of military rice is being forcibly pushed forward at the expense of two million starving people. However, on the other hand, news of the Indian National Army's advance in East Asia, although suppressed, is gradually seeping into the population, stimulating the vigorous secret movements of the domestic vanguard. Especially within the military, impatient rebels have reached 100,000, and the organizational system, relying solely on money and power, is shaking and trembling. Aside from the low-key actions of various political factions observing the situation, the people are eager to escape the heavy oppression and unease of their lives, and a rebellion against British imperialist domination is imminent. This article attempts to dissect the reality of Anglo-American-Chongqing military cooperation playing out on the stage of India, observe the increasingly active movements of various domestic political factions as the political season arrives, and examine the food problem, which is a matter of life and death for all of India, and its subsequent development.</p>
<p>The first noteworthy point is the plan for the close coordination between the Southwest Pacific and Southeast Asian armies. The meetings between Chief of Staff Sacharand, Mountbatten, Wedemeyer, and Mountbatten in Delhi indicate that the enemy's overall counter-offensive operation is extremely active and suggest some changes in its scale.</p>
<p>The Enemy Intends to Invade from the Sea</p>
<p>It is already known that the enemy has announced contact with Japanese forces in northern Burma and Arakan. In addition to this land-based counter-offensive, they intend to invade from the sea to recapture Burma. Mountbatten, who is training "surprise landing forces," intends to initiate an operation with the understanding of the Southwest Pacific Allied forces, and this intention is becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<p>The recent increase in the proportion of American military forces in India is an undeniable fact. The increase in American influence over India, which was pointed out during the Arakan campaign this spring, can no longer be concealed. The Chongqing forces stationed in Assam are supplied with equipment and training by the United States. Of particular note is the world's longest regular air route between the US and India.</p>
<p>This air route crosses the Atlantic from Ohio, passes through the Mediterranean via Turkey, and reaches Karachi in India, requiring a total of eight days. This is because the Australian air route has been blocked by the Japanese military, so a new route was established in addition to the air routes through Australia and North Africa. The actual effect of this new air route is questionable. Its main objectives, in addition to replenishing the command system for generals and transporting aircraft, are to transport engines that India cannot produce and to organize the US-Indian Air Force.</p>
<p>Reinforcing the Chongqing Army Stationed in India</p>
<p>Thus, due to the changes in North Africa and the Mediterranean, the United States, with its vain ambition to dominate the world, is increasingly exposing its intention to place the innocent people of India under its control. Noteworthy in this trend is the reinforcement of the Chongqing army stationed in India. The enemy previously announced that approximately 100,000 soldiers were being sent from Chongqing to North Assam via the perilous Yunnan-India air route, where they were trained by American officers and equipped by the United States, and deployed to attack the so-called New Assam-Burma road. And recently, this deployment has been further strengthened. The Chongqing army, active in the unscrupulous schemes of Britain and America, is now being dispatched to the forefront of reopening the "New Assam Road." This is merely a sacrifice for empty talk. Chiang Kai-shek, eager to protect his own regime, has finally placed his army under the control of the US military, leaving it stationed in a distant foreign land, leaving a major stain on East Asian history.</p>
<p>The details of the new Assam-Burma road promoted by the enemy are not yet clear, but it likely refers to the route previously used by caravan traders and the mule road in northern Burma built by the British army invading Yunnan. The hope of opening this route is about to vanish, and it is feared that not a single soldier will be able to cross the Nu River.</p>
<p>It is said that Mountbatten accompanied Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, who had returned from the Cairo Conference, to inspect the troops stationed in India. This shows the enemy's precautionary measures against Chongqing's potential defection. Earlier, Delhi Radio reported that Soong Mei-ling had been appointed as the honorary director of the Calcutta Famine Relief Committee and that the 5 million rupees in relief funds sent by Chongqing had arrived. In reality, although this fund was nominally provided by the Chongqing government, it was later collected from the people through forced apportionment. The frantic collaboration between Chongqing and India is entirely dictated by the strategies of the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>As such, due to the increased proportion of American forces and the relocation of the Chongqing army, the forces deployed on the eastern Indian border have reached a considerable number. Recent intelligence from East India also indicates the addition of black African soldiers and a focus on the Gurkha troops.</p>
<p>Earlier, Auchinleck had inspected Punjab, and then, in late November, Wavell inspected the Northwest Frontier Province. These facts show how much the enemy values the Gurkha troops and how much they want to gather people from the Himalayan border regions in large numbers.</p>
<p>Desertions from the Indian Army</p>
<p>Currently, within the Indian army, there are several daily instances of soldiers deserting in order to return to farming due to rising agricultural prices. At the same time, rampant abuse by officers, theft, bribery, and other despicable acts are widespread. Anglo-American military cadres are encountering unexpected difficulties in handling these incidents. In this situation, the militarization of Ceylon is noteworthy. Recently, in order to strengthen transportation links with mainland India, the process of acquiring the saturated South Indian Railway is underway, in an effort to strengthen military transportation. After the strengthening of India's military base, it is clear that there will be a fierce crackdown on domestic political factions, especially vanguard factions. The publicly disclosed activities of Indian political forces are low-key. The All India Andhra Mahasabha held a congress, followed by the All India Muslim League and the Hindu Mahasabha each holding congresses to welcome the arrival of the political season. The Muslim League, which has considerable influence, continues to express its closeness to Britain.</p>
<p>In fact, the possibility of various states moving towards a coalition movement is quite strong, so it seems that there is a connection to the Hindu Mahasabha. As such, as a result of Jinnah's injury, the president of the Hindu Mahasabha, Chaibagar, expressed his intention to resign, so it can generally be said that it has a pro-British tendency. But we believe that the tendency to lean towards the Muslim League may not succeed. In short, the first step of a coalition cabinet must begin with a population survey. The ratio of Muslims and Hindus in Bihar, Orissa, Assam, and other places may not have been clearly investigated.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the "Rajagopalachari Movement," the so-called observers outside the prison movement, which is currently operating secretly. The activities of other small parties are still low-key. Wavell considers it too early and has not taken any political action, but among the low-key activities of various factions, the secret movement of the vanguard is unique, spreading throughout India and becoming increasingly intense. The continuous waves of terror and strikes illustrate this potential. Committees at the local, district, and city levels, composed of elites from various factions aiming for revolution, have also established units and are deploying trained personnel to launch labor strikes. The opportune moment for Bose's overseas movement is being actively cultivated.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing in this turbulence is Gandhi's wife's illness in prison. If there is no possibility of release now, it is expected that unexpected disturbances will occur.</p>
<p>The Seriousness of the Food Problem</p>
<p>Finally, let's look at the food problem that is spreading throughout India. Although the British and American armies have provided some assistance, the scope is small and a drop in the bucket, unable to alleviate the severe famine. In terms of prices, food prices have increased sevenfold, and general prices have increased fivefold. Black markets are rampant in the city, and recently they have spread to fuel, with people openly robbing coal in broad daylight. Fuel shortages have caused factories to reduce operations, leading to strikes. Transportation is extremely difficult, the food shortage is becoming more severe, and it is stimulating price increases.</p>
<p>The Secretary of State for India, Amery, announced in Parliament that the Indian government was providing meals for 2 million people daily. But now that check cannot be cashed and has been temporarily suspended. He is only announcing empty words about the arrival of Australian wheat ships or the assistance of the army to deceive the public.</p>
<p>In short, the Anglo-American-Chongqing cooperation in India, which is the opposite of the fundamental demands of India itself, is encountering many difficulties and lacking spiritual cohesion. These events illustrate the future destiny of India. (翔: Translated from the Western Sunrise News, December 18th)</p>

<h3>Retail Tax is a Direct Tax; Price Gouging is Prohibited; Relevant Authorities to Discuss Measures</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - Regarding the special consumption tax to be implemented by the Ministry of Finance, the retail tax rate has been set at 4%. In the past few days, some merchants have been spreading rumors about the tax rate, taking the opportunity to raise prices and seek illegal profits. Shao, the director of the Tax Bureau, believes that such illegal behavior easily stimulates price increases, unsettles people's minds, and greatly affects people's livelihoods. He also points out that the 4% retail tax is a direct tax, directly levied on the buyer, and not borne by the intermediate merchant. However, ignorant merchants have arbitrarily increased prices by 30% to 40% or more, which is completely inappropriate. It is reported that Director Shao plans to discuss measures with relevant authorities to strictly correct this situation, in order to restore prices to the levels before mid-month and to order police officers to conduct secret inspections at any time. If there is any deliberate violation, they will be dealt with according to the law in order to maintain people's livelihood and prevent abuses.</p>

<h3>The Destitute People's Work-Study Center Hosted a Tea Party for All Sectors; Exhibition of Destitute People's Achievements and Works</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Destitute People's Work-Study Center, run by the Shanghai World Red Cross Society, has been established since May of this year, combining education and training, and has achieved a certain scale. A tea party was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the center in Caohejing to entertain all sectors, and an exhibition of the destitute people's achievements and works was held. Over one hundred people attended, including Secretary-General Zhao, representing Mayor Chen, Director Sun of the Bureau of Social Welfare, Yan Huiching, Zhang Yipeng, and Zhao Jinqing.</p>
<p>Chairman Reports on the Progress</p>
<p>The event began with a speech by Chairman Li Sihao, who briefly stated that the center began preparations in December 1932 and, after several discussions with the city authorities, finally got underway on the 2nd of this month, starting construction and installing equipment. At the end of May, it began to take in over 500 destitute people, providing education and moral transformation to eradicate their bad habits. Among them, there were many with excellent skills and expertise in mechanics, electricity, rotary, textiles, sewing, and other crafts. Based on their character, they were promoted to assistant technicians. The rest were taught according to their aptitudes or sent to major factories in other areas for training. In addition, the selection of clerks, attendants, hygiene personnel, hairdressers, bathers, and general workers, as well as the inspection of food and the distribution of vegetables, were all based on nutritional needs. However, due to the current soaring prices, the center relies on the support of people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Guests from All Sectors Gave Speeches in Succession</p>
<p>Secretary-General Zhao, representing Mayor Chen, followed with a speech, briefly stating that the city government had long recognized the large number of destitute people in Shanghai. Fortunately, the Red Cross Society was engaged in civilian work and work-study production, allowing them to be self-sufficient and self-supporting, and becoming useful citizens. He expressed great admiration for this satisfactory achievement. Then, Mr. Zhang Yipeng gave a speech, briefly stating that before coming to the center, he had imagined the destitute people as still retaining their original appearance, but after a real visit, he felt that they had all transformed into good citizens, which was extremely gratifying. Next, Mr. Zhao Jinqing said that the center's achievements in such a short period of time were due to the enthusiasm, responsibility, and active production of the members of the Red Cross Society. Mr. Ling Xianwen said that the plan for receiving and caring for the destitute people had been in place for two years, and now that such effective results had been achieved, he hoped that everyone would make the greatest effort in the future. Finally, Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper, briefly stated that the views expressed by everyone just now were very sincere. If society could train a non-productive person to become a productive person, this would be the most positive work. He expressed his deep respect for the enthusiasm and efforts of the members of the Red Cross Society. At the same time, he hoped that the government and local people would continue to encourage and assist them so that this undertaking could be sustained and expanded.</p>

<h3>West Youth Basketball Tournament: Hualian Defeats Huanan; Achieving Four Wins in Four Matches</h3>
<p>In the West Youth Basketball Tournament, games are traditionally suspended on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.

After this, games will resume on the third day of the New Year. Last night's A-group match between Huanan and Hualian saw Zhang Mianxuan score the opening point with a free throw for Hualian. After a long period of back-and-forth, it was all Hualian's game, with Huanan showing no vitality. At the end of the first half, Hualian had a significant advantage with a score of 13-4. In the second half, Huanan ultimately suffered a major defeat with a score of 1-53. Hualian maintained its impressive record of four wins and no losses. In the final match, Dahua fought Giant. Giant easily defeated Dahua with a score of 30-16 (15-10 in the first half).

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Vocational Training for Refugees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center, operated by the World Red Cross Society, has been established for half a year, accommodating more than 500 refugees and teaching them skills to enable them to produce. Yesterday, the center hosted a visit for people from all walks of life and exhibited refugee-produced goods in order to attract the attention of the community.</p>
<p>"Refugees" are purely destructive elements in society, they are parasitic elements, and to put it strictly, they are the dregs of humanity. How to accommodate and train refugees who cannot produce, and make them into productive elements, is the common obligation and responsibility of the authorities and the community. Now is wartime, a time when we need to increase production and conserve consumption, especially when we need to use the maximum manpower on the one hand and save the maximum material resources on the other. Therefore, making purely consuming refugees learn skills and become productive elements is a social work of utmost urgency.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center is the one undertaking this work, which is objectively very important. Although the center has only been in operation for half a year, its achievements are already quite remarkable, further proving the necessity of this work and its help to society.</p>
<p>We hope that the government authorities and enthusiastic people in the community will pay attention to the importance of "vocational training for refugees" in increasing production, conserving consumption, and improving social appearance, and jointly contribute money and effort to assist the Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center in expanding its work, and if necessary, establish branch centers, so that there is not a single refugee in the city, and every refugee becomes a productive element.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Thrift Society to Be Reorganized Today</h3>

The address will remain at 160 Da Shanghai Road (Avenue Edward VII), 3rd floor. There will be no major changes in internal personnel. The reorganization and establishment meeting is scheduled to be held today (30th) at 11:00 am at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association. All members of the association are welcome to participate freely without restrictions. Ding Mocun, Minister of Social Welfare, will personally attend. Zhang Yipeng will chair the meeting.</p>
<h3>Dance Hall Business Hours Shortened by One Hour</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: In response to the capital's youth and student anti-smoking and gambling movement, the youth and students of this city held a righteous demonstration parade the day before yesterday (27th). All dance halls in the city were ordered to close. It is now learned that the First Police Department has decided to rectify the dance halls, stipulating that from today onwards, the business hours will be reduced by one hour each night, and all dance halls must close by 11:00 pm. At the same time, orders have been issued to the relevant branch bureaus to investigate the current situation of the dance halls and submit reports for verification.</p>
<p>Dance Hall Employees Petition to Resume Work</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the dance halls in this city were ordered to close, more than 3,000 employees and dancers petitioned the First Bureau yesterday morning (29th) to resume work in order to maintain their livelihoods. They also sent representatives to meet with Deputy Director Su. Deputy Director Su, along with Chief Secretary Zhao and Director of the Administrative Department Lu, received them and explained the significance of the ban in detail. Considering the livelihoods of the employees, they were temporarily allowed to resume business, but the business hours must be shortened, and they must cooperate with the propaganda work for youth and students and not obstruct it.</p>
<p>Economic Office Comments</p>
<h3>More on Consumption Special Tax</h3>
<p>The previous day, we discussed the wartime consumption special tax, believing it to be the best policy for regulating wartime finance. For consumption items that are harmful to the public, such as smoking, gambling, and dancing, an extra tax should be levied as much as possible. Although it cannot completely eliminate these vices in an instant, it can still be used as a means of prohibition through taxation. As for all commodities related to people's daily lives, in this time of rising prices and declining livelihoods, we should not forget the intention of caring for people's livelihoods when levying special taxes. In other words, we must plan for both aspects in order to be reasonable.</p>
<p>According to the tax authorities' response to the Central News Agency reporter the day before yesterday, the retail tax rate has been decided to be 4% ad valorem, while major food necessities will be exempt from tax. From this, it seems that the authorities are indeed able to consider the current hardships of people's lives when levying the wartime consumption special tax. However, some unscrupulous merchants are again using the excuse of levying consumption special tax to arbitrarily raise prices, with some raising prices by 30% to 40% or 50%. It is not known how many commodities necessary for people's daily lives are included in this, and how many people who are struggling to survive at the lowest standard of living are affected. The special tax has not yet been levied, but the rate of price increases has already been ten times the tax rate of the new tax. This is the most serious phenomenon in the announcement of the wartime consumption special tax, and it urgently requires a clear statement from the tax authorities and strict suppression from the control authorities in order to live up to the people's obligation to pay the wartime consumption special tax.</p>
<h3>Bankers Association Held General Meeting Yesterday to Revise Articles of Association and Fill Vacancies on the Board of Directors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Bankers Association held its 14th general meeting of members at 3:30 pm yesterday (29th). More than 200 people attended, including directors, supervisors, and representatives of 170 member banks. Standing Director Ye Fu presided over the meeting, and Secretary-General Lin Kanghou of the association reported on the association's affairs for the past six months (i.e., six months). The following important cases were then passed:</p>
<p>Approval of Important Cases</p>
<p>Approval of the membership of 14 banks, including Lih Tai, Shanghai Xingye, and Huatong; Approval of the withdrawal of Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank due to closure; Approval of the resignation of Director Chen Zhitang and the replacement by alternate Director Sun Zhongli; Approval of the final accounts for the current and previous terms and the budget for the upper term of the 33rd year; Approval of the Board of Directors' resolution to levy a special fee for the upper term of the 33rd year, with each bank paying a special fee of 200 yuan per month; Approval of the application for membership from four banks, including Huaan and Fushi; Approval of the draft revision of the association's articles of association; Temporary proposal: Due to electricity restrictions, it was decided that from January 1, 33rd year, the business hours of each member bank will be changed to 10:00 am to 3:00 pm, and Saturdays will still be 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, and the money industry association should be notified to implement this uniformly.</p>
<p>Report on Association Affairs</p>
<p>Secretary-General Lin reported, stating briefly: In the past six months, the government has promulgated several laws and regulations concerning the financial industry, among which the amendment of the bank registration regulations is particularly important. In the past, the capital of the silver and money industry was less than one million yuan, but according to the current amended regulations, the total amount must be at least six million yuan. If also engaging in trust business, an additional capital of two million yuan is required for each. Therefore, most new banks must handle capital increases, and the deadline is set for the end of this year. The association, considering that some banks and firms may not be able to complete the process in time, requested an extension of six months with the money industry street. Recently, we received instructions to extend it to the end of March of the 33rd year. In the past six months, the Shanghai financial market has generally been stable. During this period, the association's joint reserve association has revised the interbank lending measures. In addition, the government's implementation of the purchase of yarn and cloth is indirectly related to the mortgage of the industry, so we sent a letter to the Commerce and Trade Control Committee to set up a pledge right and notified each bank to handle it as scheduled. The Banking Association also revised and improved the warehouse receipt transfer method, notified each bank and firm to accept and make reserve deposits, handled prize-winning time deposits, stipulated the method of abolishing forward capital, and appointed members of the small group for revising the articles of association. Since July, 18 banks have applied for membership successively. As of now, there are 170 members, representing 622 people.</p>
<p>Revision of Articles of Association</p>
<p>The association passed the following articles in Chapter III, Article 3, Chapter IV, Article 12, and Chapter VII, Article 40 of the articles of association: Chapter III, Article 3: Any bank legally organized with completely Chinese capital within the Shanghai Special City area, registered with the Ministry of Finance and Industry, and having a business license and formally opened for business for more than six months, may join the association as a member with the introduction of two members of the association and after approval by the board of directors. Chapter IV, Article 12: The association shall, in accordance with the Provisional Regulations and Implementation Rules for Industrial and Commercial Associations, each member bank may send one to three representatives depending on the number of people it employs, but no one may serve as a representative of two members at the same time. Anyone with one of the following circumstances may not be a representative of a member of the association: (1) Someone outside the industry (2) Someone without capacity for civil conduct (3) Someone deprived of civil rights (4) Someone expelled from the association (5) Someone declared bankrupt and not yet restored. Chapter VII, Article 40: The association's expenses are divided into the following four items: (1) Membership fee: each member pays 3,000 yuan once (2) Monthly fee: each member pays 200 yuan per month (3) Special fee (4) Fixed fund.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Committee Temporarily Suspends Wheat Purchases</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Commerce and Trade Control Committee has decided to temporarily suspend wheat purchases before the adjustment of the technical work of wheat purchase is completed, in order to adjust the steps. Yesterday, the person in charge of the committee issued a statement saying: In order to enable flour and wheat operators to develop healthily, strive to increase production, and enrich people's food, the committee has formulated a wheat purchase plan and approved the price of wheat in the producing area at 350 yuan per 100 market catties. At the same time, the price of flour bran is stipulated in order to balance the value of raw materials and products. For several months, thanks to the guidance of the competent authorities and the cooperation of operators, the work has been smooth and gratifying. However, recently, due to the stimulation of general prices, the price of wheat has risen sharply, making it difficult to purchase raw materials. However, the committee has decided to maintain the aforementioned approved wheat purchase price and has repeatedly stated this. Because flour is also a major food for the people, if the raw material increases, the price of flour will inevitably increase, directly affecting people's livelihoods and affecting general prices. The committee started purchasing in early July and has been purchasing for six months so far. The results have all reached the planned quantity. In addition to supplying flour bran to the people of Huazhong, special needs have been completely paid. The planned output to North China and other regions has also reached eight tenths. Currently, most flour mills still have inventory, so there is no need to increase the wheat purchase price. Now, in order to carry out the plan, complete the price stabilization policy, and increase purchase efficiency, the committee has prepared a new and more advanced plan for the technical aspects of wheat purchase. Before the implementation of the plan, the purchase work will be temporarily suspended. As for barley and yuan wheat, the designated commissioned merchants were once designated to purchase due to special needs, and the number of purchases has reached a considerable amount, so purchases are also temporarily suspended. However, grains are all controlled materials, and free movement and arbitrary hoarding are not allowed.</p>
<p>Management Measures for Small-Scale Machine Plants</p>
<p>In addition, the committee has also prepared management measures for small-scale machine plants and stone grinding mills and submitted them to the Commerce and Trade Control Committee for promulgation and implementation. Registration procedures are currently being carried out. In the future, the allocation of electricity to each member factory will be reviewed by the committee and forwarded to the Alliance Huazhong Electric Power Company for execution. Operators who cooperate with the control will be discussed with the authorities to allocate flour, cloth bags, coal, machine oil, and purchase funds to provide them with full assistance. All plans are being planned and implemented in order to do our best to enrich people's food and stabilize prices, so as not to fail the original intention of the establishment of the committee.</p>
<h3>China Stock Daily Expands, Renovates, and Relocates to New Address</h3>

<h3>Charity Sale of Medicine and Needle Relief</h3>

Therefore, most patients feel that good medicine is unavailable, not to mention poor patients. I, out of a desire for human mutual assistance, would like to ask you to distribute 30 needles (one large box) of Cardiazol heart tonic, produced by the German Knoll Pharmaceutical Factory, from the remaining excess of 66 needles, to various benevolent organizations or charitable hospitals and enthusiastic social service doctors, so that patients who are unable to purchase them can use them, and sell the remaining 36 needles (one large box plus six needles) for charity, donating half of the proceeds to your newspaper's student loan fund and the rest to poverty relief funds." (Note: The charity sale of medicine and needles is stored here for sale, priced at 200 yuan per needle.)</p>

<h3>General Overview of the Work of the Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center</h3>
<p>(1) Preparation Process The center began preparations in November of the 31st year of the Republic of China. After several joint meetings with municipal authorities, the organizational methods and the amount of expenses to be shared were determined. The location was temporarily borrowed from the Caohe Refugee Vocational Training Center. Due to various reasons, after several negotiations, it was finally settled in February of this year. Then, we began to work with workers and repair, and separately installed equipment. On May 28th of this year, we began to accommodate refugees.</p>
<p>(2) Organizational Outline Regarding the management and execution issues of the center, the municipal authorities have previously agreed that the municipal authorities will jointly organize the Management Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center, with nine members. One chairman, one vice chairman, and other members are responsible for all matters of the center. The committee will organize the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center, prefixed with the eight characters "Operated by the World Red Cross Society." Eleven executive committee members were publicly elected, and the executive committee members then elected a chairman and a vice chairman to handle all matters. Famous people from all walks of life are invited to be honorary members. In addition, a general affairs section is attached, with one director and two deputy directors. Finance, training, health, craft, and shelter distribution committees are also organized, and specialized personnel are hired to serve as members of each committee.</p>
<p>(3) Collection Method The standards and number of refugees to be collected were previously agreed upon by the municipal authorities. Municipal authorities in each district dispatched personnel to collect them on the streets, regardless of gender. The age range is 18 to 45 years old. However, those suffering from mental illness, infectious diseases, venereal diseases, and those who smoke opium or heroin are not allowed to be admitted. The number of refugees sent in by each district is determined according to the proportion of donations pledged by each district, allocated in a ratio of 6:4:3. Before collecting refugees and sending them to the center, each district will first notify the center and dispatch a doctor to jointly examine them. Those deemed suitable for sending to the center will then be sent to the center for accommodation. The number of admissions is temporarily set at 1,000. The Shanghai Special Municipality should send 308 people, the First District (former Municipal Council) should send 461 people, and the Eighth District (former French Concession) should send 231 people. Since the beginning of accommodation, excluding those who do not meet the admission requirements and those who are successively removed and those who guarantee themselves out of the center, the actual number of refugees admitted is 526.</p>
<p>(4) Training Policy Training refugees cannot be compared to other education. They are generally lazy by nature, not specialized in production, and some even enjoy begging, and are unrepentant of self-degradation. After collecting people, it is not easy to change their habits without disciplined training and moral influence. However, among them, there are also talents who have studied normal school and middle school, and those who have skills in machinery, electrical, wheelbarrow, textile, sewing, and miscellaneous arts. The center will appoint those whose character is slightly pure as staff members of the center, or promote them to assistant technicians. In addition, after national training is successful, they can gradually become useful talents for society. The main points of the implementation of training are listed below:</p>
<p>A. Spiritual Training The cultivation of the refugee's personality focuses on the training of virtues. The center promotes spiritual training based on the creed of the New National Movement, inspires the refugee's self-esteem and remorse, and guides them towards the path of improvement. It is supplemented by various entertainment activities and their aspirations, so that they have a considerable interest in work and production. The training items are as follows: Spiritual talks Lectures by celebrities Ceremony training Leisure activities Virtue training The above items are the responsibility of the Training Committee in conjunction with the director of the center. In addition, newspapers and art exhibitions, chess competitions, song practice, and drama performances are also held.</p>
<p>B. Physical Training Refugees have been living on the streets for a long time, and their bodies are mostly unhealthy. According to the doctor's examination report, most of them lack nutrition and vitamins, and anemia is a common symptom. The prescription is solid in diet and nourishment, and physical training is also very important for production efficiency. The center has actively trained for this issue, and as a result, the health of the refugees has gradually recovered, and those with sallow complexions have turned plump. The training items are as follows: Morning exercises National martial arts Tai Chi boxing wrestling Track and field Other physical education equipment (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Youth (6)</p>
<p>News of the establishment of Manchukuo spread throughout the world. The May 15 Incident occurred in Japan. But those matters were too significant and their meanings too profound for a fourteen-year-old to fully understand. He only happily lived his new junior high school life.</p>
<p>Since the story of the Three Brave Soldiers, Mr. Ogata became the most popular teacher. The homeroom teacher, Mr. Hara, was also a good teacher. As for Mr. Oshima, who was skilled in kendo, he was quite different. With thick eyebrows, fierce eyes, a height of five feet eight inches, and a weight of twenty-three kan (each kan is roughly equivalent to 100 Chinese taels, so twenty-three kan is about 140-plus catties - Translator's Note). With a stern face, he was a teacher to be feared upon sight. But unexpectedly, he was very gentle, serving as both the head of the judo club and the head of the kendo club (both judo and kendo are Japanese martial arts), holding the 5th dan rank in kendo and an even higher 6th dan rank in judo. Consequently, the young men held him in great awe.</p>
<p>"It is said that Mr. Oshima is a descendant of Lord Saigo."</p>
<p>After hearing such rumors, some students made a big fuss about it.</p>
<p>All the new students wanted to join Mr. Oshima's kendo and judo clubs. For some reason, the majority wanted to join the kendo club. Due to equipment limitations, the school put in a lot of effort to allocate students to the different clubs. From the beginning, Zhenren wanted to join the judo club. One reason was his confidence in wrestling, and another reason was that judo, which involves hand-to-hand combat without weapons, suited his nature. Moreover, Mr. Ogata, whom he admired, was the director of the judo club. Longfu, after much deliberation, finally joined the kendo club.</p>
<p>The handsome and decisive Principal Kawada delivered a speech to the new students at the end of their first month.</p>
<p>"I am from a family of sweet potato farmers..."</p>
<p>Despite his humble claim of not being born in the castle town, his manner was refreshing and elegant, completely different from that of the other teachers.</p>
<p>"The principal's Western-style suit is tailored in Tokyo, and the style is excellent,"</p>
<p>Fu judged. The elegance of having lectured on Western history at Gakushuin University in Tokyo for many years still remained. He could not be compared to the badger principal described in Soseki's "Botchan" novel.</p>
<p>The head teacher, Mr. Iguchi, had a special quirk. Whenever there was a ceremony or sports day at the school, Mr. Iguchi would always say that it would definitely not rain. As a result, he often got drenched because he didn't bring rain gear. Even so, he never changed his belief.</p>
<p>There was also a teacher who made a very good impression on the students. That was Major Kikuchi, the assigned military officer. He had not been at the school for long. With sharp eyes like a hawk and a dark face, anyone who saw him could not help but feel his extraordinary passion and fighting spirit.</p>
