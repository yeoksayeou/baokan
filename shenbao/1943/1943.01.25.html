<h3 id="c1">簡政 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>參戰以後，中國進入一個新的國際環境，一面固然是更加密切地和日本協力，一面更要開始以中國自己的力量來解決自己的問題。在這橷的政治形勢之下，舉凡軍事·政台·經濟·外交各部門，都要求政府加以刷新，都要求加强政治效率。而兩星期以來，本報迭就政治·經濟·軍事·外交以及人民生活問題，作有系統的闡述與獻議，以求加強行政。然而我們還要指出，要加強行政，就必須在各部門澈底實行簡政。</p>
<p>簡政的反面是繁複，混亂和腐敗，譬如目前的重慶政權正是這樣。機構上疊床架屋，舖張小朝廷的門面；人事上的閑差冗員，觸目皆是，以至行政效率上的一紙公文，輾轉經久，一事無成。對於各種問題的解決，事業的推行，常是推諉拖延，不負責任。於是造成了機構不靈，聯系缺乏，勤惰不分，考核無據，紀律弛廢，賞罰不平的病態。不檢之行，隨地皆是；怨憤之聲，盈溢朝野。而且機構和人員一多，開支就浩繁，經費因之不足。一方面政府濫發通貨，以爲挹注，造成惡性膨脹的危險；一方面使安分守己的人，窮困得無以安家。稍作活動的，只有兼差卞能維持生活，自私自利的便兼營副業，利用其居官的地位，廣設羅網，以大發國難財。這樣弄得天怒人怨，還那裏講得到提高行政效率？重慶政權這種倒行逆施的結果，固然無庸爲之惋惜；可是，和平區內的各級政府，對於重慶政權這種不知簡政的禍害，不能不引以為鑑。</p>
<p>「簡政」的第一要旨是「法簡民便」四個大字。本來「政簡刑清」，是我國從政的一句格言，意思就在行政簡化，使人民感德甚於畏威，那麼政府也實際上收到效果了。重慶政權絕不了解這一點，政府今天一個主張，明天一個主張，今天頒布一種規章，明天又頒布一種法令，各方面的統制，尤其無微不至。可是這樣繁法嚴　的結果，是矛盾時出，衝突時生，造成了誤國殃民的事實。我們現在就要一反重慶政權所爲，絕不多立新法，多設新章，而努力以求法規的簡易化，適合新時代的需要。同時明瞭法規，並不是一成不變的呆東西，凡對國家民族有利而且便利於人民的，就必娘加以保存，促便實現。凡因時代的轉移，而不利於國家民族及不便利於人民的，應該加以修改取消。果能以這個標凖來檢點一下，對現行法規，加以適常的調處，一定會史便於執行，更會收到政治上的效率。</p>
<p>其次，自然是緊　機構，和裁撤冗員。就前者說，只要不再設新機構，對於已有的機關，切小可這也捨不得，那世捨不得，而要加以調整。不必要的斷然取消，類似的實行合併，龐大的加以緊縮，總之，是不要舖張塲面，必須簡單合理。就後者說，就在做到「精幹」兩字。用人的標凖，不要問他有什麽私人關係，只看工作精神，負責態度和辦事才能。舉凡只領薪不做事的閒差，領薪多做事少的冗員，不積極不稱職的人員，就應不論其位置的高下，介紹人的有力與否，都應該加以裁減。只有把政府機關和救濟失業的慈善機關完全分淸，才能使政府不委棄一個有用之人，不浪費一分有用之力。至於被裁人員，應該使之各就所長，參加生產事業，或轉入適合的工作，或加以特種訓練，使成專材。有人說參戰以後，政治工作一定要比參戰以前繁忙百培，簡政結果，恐怕不易應付。其實這是「知其一不知其二」的說法。參戰後各部門工作的繁忙，向是意想中事，　是工作的推進，首賴於縝密約計割與艱苦的工作精神，決不是多設機關，多加人員可以了事的。而且相反的，正因爲是參戰了之後，各部門的工作都要加强推行，更非厲行簡政，不能適　參戰後的要求。要知道目前的國際戰爭，將是長期戰爭，在經濟上，物質上都要作通　的打算，非從節的開支和預防通貨膨眼不可。厲行簡政之後，席材既去，則眞才得以有所作爲，決不怕辦事無人。以有限的人，去做無限的事，這是近年來日本與德國政治上成功的最大特點，實在値得借鏡。</p>
<p>然而，簡政的最高目標是加强行政效率，以求適應新時代的新形勢，以求有更充分力量担負起一面建設新中國，一面協力友邦爭取大東亞戰爭的勝利。所以下面幾點，必須同時顧到：第一，我們所謂「簡政，」決不是說由少數人包辦；少數人包辦，決不會有好結果，中國歷史上的經騐敎訓都早已證明了這一點，而重慶政權就是以少數人包辦，一黨一派以至一姓包辦，慘收的結果，實在是個活榜樣。我們要一反包辦而爲合作，特別是在簡政中，更要注意各方人材的集中，才能以最少的人，辦最多的事。第一，原來的專家，舊有的人材，固然要集中，要延納，但尤其要緊的是新人材的培養。不僅要愛護已經訓練成就的人材，切勿輕於糟場，切勿輕加委曲。不僅要本愛惜人材之心，從各方面去我求人材，去保障人材，同時還要適應目前和今後國家的需要，積極去培植專門人材。如果，用人適當，調節有方，賢能得展所長，庸愚得受敎養，那麼行政效率就不提自高了。但是還必須注意第三，儘速成立眞正的民意機構，來監督行政，這樣簡政的意義才眞完善，而行政的效率才能提高，當前的重大使命也才能從容地担負起來。</p>

<p>— 金山</p>
<p>憧憬後方不辭長途跋涉生活無着遑論入學讀書</p>
<p>去年，浙东戰事發生的時候，許多青年學生，却憧憬着內地的「自由」，紛紛的跋涉長途，結果失望了，形成來得去不得進退維谷。下面是兩對訴苦的信：</p>
<p>其一</p>
<p>懷著一個沉痛和悲哀的心，我們會含着眼淚讀過楊剛先生「浙贛學生在建陽」的那一篇文章，今天又聽到關於我們「浙東漂泊學生」的消息。我們真太興奮和歡喜了，因為我們明白，在這個茫茫無依的世界裏，終究還有公正的人們在關懷和同情着我們。這些可貴的同情和關懷，竟趕走了我們心底之中的頹廢，給與我以新的期望，正像一個飽受凌辱的孩子，需要在他的慈母面前發洩出他所蘊藏着的委屈一樣；恕我們在這裏粗魯地喊出一點我們不能抑制住的悲憤</p>
<p>我們並不在這裏嘆訴二個月來長途奔波的千辛萬苦，只是對於二個月來寄以無限希望的後方，我們是感到了蒼茫！</p>
<p>方竟沒有可以收容我們的地方，我們所得到的，就是還在「中央賑濟會」領到五十元的救濟金，五十元的數目，在我們的眼光之中雖不算少，可是在生活程度高的怕人的桂林，我們能活幾天呢？「賑濟會」只賑濟一次，這是一個鐵似的規律，於是難怪一羣羣在飢餓綫上掙扎的青年，在每一條街道的角落裏奔走。爲了肚子，我們是顧不得面子了，更顧不得無數冷酷的柱石碰碎自己的鼻子了！唉！想不到在後方的戰區學生，竟會淪落到這個地步！此情此景，如果給了尚在淪陷區域的我們的父母們知道，他們將會怎樣的傷心！國家有着這麼一大批青年在異鄉的街頭流浪，人們更作何感想呢？</p>
<p>暑假過去了，是開學的時候，眼看着一輛輛人力車拖着學生進學校，觸景生情，顧念思昔，怎不使我們難受，怎不使我們羡慕！秋風乍起，遊子衣單，由誰來給我們製縫棉被和寄送寒衣？我們將怎樣來應付擺在眼前的飢寒！</p>
<p>有些同學正準備進赴重慶的，可是沒有經濟的能力，有什麽辦法？</p>
<p>你們是最明白我們的衷情的，也是最恩能夠同情在苦難之中的青年，因此我們敢作一次迫切的呼籲！「救救寄身異地的失學青年！」爲了已來桂林和未到桂林的數千百青年，我們向對於戰區學生有管理和救濟的義務機關，提出二點迫切的要求：</p>
<p>（一）希望「中央賑濟會」和教育機關，速先墊出款項來，共同解決我們膳宿和求學的問題，使免受流浪街頭之苦。</p>
<p>（二）並望以上各機關，對於西行的同學，從速給予旅費的幫助，使免長留於桂林，過痛苦的生活。浙江省立聯合高中學生童君昌等二十八人</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>我是從蘇北的堅城流亡到這裏來的一個青年，當我到金華後，就嘗到失學彷徨的痛苦。於本年四月，「教部」令英士大學設先修班在金華招生，才得安心求學，不幸到麗水後，而浙贛戰事發生，在囊空如洗德狀態下，冒著熱日的威脅，苦力掙扎，長途跋涉，跑到閩北潭城，閩省每日發生活費二元，在這米珠薪桂的時候，食宿醫藥，此區區之數，將何以維持？失學無依，痛苦倍增，自到此後，同學們死亡，疾病，乃全回滬的，日漸增多，唉！想不到到了這裏竟如此之遭遇，真使人萬分痛心。但是當局門，何嘗不愛護青年，極力救濟青年，而結果如何呢？我們青年們內心的悲痛，向何處申訴？誰能同情我們青年失學流離的苦悶呢？照目前形勢看，有管當局若不火速徹底的解決，那我們這數萬的青年，惟有餓死！凍死！病死！悶死！……希望你站在同情我們的立場上，請求關係當局設法徹底清安挿我們。</p>

<p>關於公共租界物資配給範圍將行擴充事、據悉、工部局物資統制部正在縝密考慮中、所傳現行實行於食米、麵粉及麵包等主要食品之配給制度、行將擴大、俾使各種食品均包括於實施範圍之內、在配給機構組織方面、常由業經向工部局登記之各業同業公會爲具體中心、一俟食品配給制度底於實施、衣料等物亦將繼起遵照同樣方法維持供應一節、記者以此詢諸關係人士、據稱若干新物品、當局確已有意置之於配給制度之下、雖然物品究爲何種、未能懸揣、亦尙無所　、</p>
<p>統制貨源　常保供應</p>
<p>消息靈通方面觀察、物資配給範圍之將行擴大爲民生方面着想、當局已加以審籌熟慮、而在尙未達於實行以前、當守緘默、此爲執行功令上之技術、商民固不必於事前加以臆斷、事實上、全市居民亟望當局將所有主要食品、施行配給、如戶口糧然、雖在數量上或有可斟酌之處、但價格之平穏及供應之足以維持需要、實爲配給之第一要義、今各種雜糧及油糖等類之統制及配給、手續尙在逐漸改良、諒不日即可臻完善妥當之境地、而且下本市各業公會向工部局登記與物資統制部公會課發生密切聯繫者、已達三百餘單位、來日担任配給機構之中樞、堪稱近乎理想、據悉當局對於擴大配給之所有考慮、端在如何統制貨源而常保其供應、</p>
<p>零售抬價已難藉口</p>
<p>又悉、兩租界當局昨起採取一致行動、規定製造商及批發商出售之一切物品、價格暫以本月二十三日定價爲準、以後非經事前核准、不得擅自增加、並限令製造廠及批發商、將二十三日各物品價格連　成本計算、抄送工部局或公董局物資統制部存照、據記者訪杳所知、此舉興去歲六七月間規定物品新法幣標價、不得超過五月底舊法幣標價平均數之半、辦法類似、所不同者、即在曩昔評價由另售商品着手、批發價及製造價不與焉、其效果已經概見、　此次限價政策、則適得其反、先由製造商及批發商所售物品之價格着手、則另售價格自可因製造及　發價格之穏定而穏定、欲求抬價、已難藉口、此則實際上固與上次辦法根本不同、　至於非經特准不得擅自抬價一點、雖對於限價容有伸縮、但必以產價成木爲率、如果時機必要、則限定售價、將與有關方面合作執行、決不輕易變更、</p>

<p>— 聶雲臺</p>
<p>本文作者聶雲台先生，年高德劭，樂善好施。近歲精研佛學，益發慈悲。布衣淡食，自奉彌儉，而以有餘，悉數布施，抱取諸社會，用之社會之旨。能聚能散，積極爲善。聞聶氏家世，七代昌盛，足見積德餘慶，初非倖致。縱不積錢貽子孫，而子孫均能繼志卓立，殊足使吾人之人生觀有新的啟發。茲篇所述，充分闡發「積錢」與「爲善」之至理，引證事實，歷歷如繪，一字一句，悉從經騐體　中寫出。尙盼讀者倍加留意，幸甚。</p>
<p>（三）再說淸朝的林文忠公則徐，他係反對英國致引起鴉片戰爭的偉人。他如果肯要發財，當時發幾百萬很容易。他認爲鴉片遺害人民，故不怕用激烈的手段，燒燬英人鴉片二萬箱，後來英人攻廣東，一年攻不進，後攻陷寗波，鎭江，淸朝小得已將林文忠公革職充軍，向英人謝罪講和，林公死後，也是家無積蓄，但是子孫數代書香不斷。曾孫輩尙有進士舉人，至今存在，前數年過世的最高法院院長林翔，亦係其中一個，而且道德均高，這又是一個不肯發財而子孫發達的證據。再看林公同時發大財的人，我可以舉幾個例，就是廣東的南海伍氏及潘氏，都是鴉片裏發大財至數白千萬，書畫　多知道，凡是海內有名的古字畫　　，多數有伍氏潘氏的圖章，表明此物曾經在兩家藏過的，可見得他們的豪富了。幾十年之後，這些珍貴的物品，又已流到別家，仙們的楠木房屋早已拆了到別家作裝飾木器了。他們的後人不聽見一個了。這兩家主人，總算是精明能幹，會發這樣的大財，在當時林又忠公總算太笨了，有財不肯發，反弄釗自己革職辦罪，但從數十年後來看他的子孫，就知道林文忠公是世間最智慧的人，伍氏潘氏却是最愚笨的人了。</p>
<p>佛法以大悲心爲根本，有大悲心才會有菩提心，若是大悲心不眞切，就與佛法不相應。換一句話說，就是違反佛法，佛法萬行，以布施爲第一步入門工夫，如果慳貪不捨，那末一切所做的佛事，都是失掉福田的效用。所以藥師經開宗明義就詳說慳貪不捨的罪過，說：「有諸衆生，不識善惡；惟懷貪吝，不知布施，及施果報，愚痴無智，缺於信根，多聚財寳，勤加守護，見乞者來，其心不喜，設不得已，而行施時，如割身肉，心生痛惜。如此之人，由此命終，生餓鬼界，或畜生道。」他們以爲我儘管慳貪，一面作點佛事功德，可免得受惡報，還可以生天得福。小曉得佛法重在直心，最忌詔曲（卽是取巧），如果一面造罪，一面花貼錢求免罰，菩薩如何能保佑這等巧人。因爲大富之人，錢財有餘，自己無用處，明知多數人餓死，不肯施財救濟，從道德上責備起來，簡直是問接的殺人。積錢最多，力最有餘而不肯布施的，負的殺人罪更重。譬如見一個極小的孩子立在井邊，快會落井了，一人在旁立着，全　開口，亦不扯開他，讓他落井死了。我們一定說，此孩算是被他殺死一樣。富人見災不救，正與此一樣，何况大富如此，連利息一小部份都不肯捨，那馬路上死的幾千幾萬飢民，豈不是要算他殺的一樣。殺幾千幾萬人的罪過，難道用　慢心，化幾千幾萬元做佛事印經修廟，就可以贖罪嗎？</p>
<p>梁武帝問達摩祖師說：我造廟度僧如此之多，有無功德。師答云：並無功德。說他所作的係有漏之因，所以不算功德。何謂有漏？就是有爲而爲，非出於質直心的緣故。經云，因地不眞，果招紆曲，就是此意。因爲梁武帝先做了許多罪業，他攻晋陽城，用水淹死魏人十萬，就此一件事，惡報已難逃免。所以發心懺悔，但是他的懺悔却是眞切，弘揚佛法實出誠心，所以感到達摩大師，實誌　尙，傳大士三位，都是菩薩化身，助他宣化，這幾位聖人豈是爲名利恭敬而來的，足見粱武帝修行眞實不虛，他編的慈悲寳懺，今名梁皇懺，係誌公主編，感到彌勒佛示夢定名。今人凡至誠悔罪拜梁皇懺，或至誠請眞正修行人代拜懺悔的，都有確實的效騐。梁武帝的發心眞切，也許得三位大士的感化，更勇猛精進。與現在我講的略花幾千幾百元做點有爲功德的，又大大不同了。</p>
<p>有爲功德係虛僞敷衍，慳貪不捨，無恭敬心慈悲心，却是眞眞實實，何能希將功折罪呢？可惜世上像這樣不明事理的人太多，長日的起陰心，做惡事，慳貪嫉妬，不起慈心，每年却要到廟裏打水陸，他不知業是我的身口意所造的，如何能將造業錢雇些和尙念幾天經可以抵銷得淸呢？除非是自己發眞心懺悔，改變以前慳貪造惡的行爲，實行慈悲喜捨的善業，那麼念經打水陸才會有益了。因爲佛法講功德，全看心的眞假，有利人之心，則一切善事爲眞；若出於利已之心，則雖行善做功德，或應酬情面勉强捐些錢，都算是假。如果利人之心十分眞切，雖出極少的錢，從佛法說起來，算極大的功德。</p>
<p>請看地藏經說的，「若人遇見最下貧窮，癃殘瘖啞，聾痴無目，如是種種不完具者，若能具大慈悲，下心含笑，親手布施，軟言慰語，是人所獲福利，如布施百恒河沙佛功德之利，何以故？因此人對最貧賤輩，及不完具者，發大慈心，是故福利之報，其大如此。」試一設想，燒香念經供養一佛，功德算大，供養百千萬憶佛的功德是如何的大。手握沙一把，數目已算不淸，何况一河的沙，更何况百個恒河的沙數。這就是說，凡人對於貧窮苦痛的人起大慈悲心，比到廟裏供佛功德大得萬萬倍。到廟裏燒香算供養一佛，若起了眞實大悲心，就是供養萬萬萬萬萬萬萬萬佛，地藏經這一章的意思，一般普通信佛的人，少有能知曉的。如能明白，就不會單做點面子上形式的燒香拜佛，而會眞實發大悲心了。就會對於貧窮困苦的人設想，出錢救濟，不致於漢不動心了。因爲不知此理，所以止去花錢打水陸念普佛，甚至於印經施像，他們不過是出錢買功德，同從前捐錢買官爵一樣，從佛眼看起來，這並非功德，不能抵銷他們貪很機巧的罪惡。所以地藏經中如來特別說，此校量布施功德一章，敎人要眞實發慈悲心呢。所以我今勸信佛人，須細讀藥師經，地藏經，明了經意，不致錯會佛旨。</p>
<p>再有華嚴經行願品，也是說明若要成佛道須對衆生（即一切人物）起大悲心。若對衆生無大悲心，終不能成就佛道，又有金剛經　，無相布施的功德無量無邊，什麼叫無相，就是出錢做慈善，救濟貧苦，出於眞實慈愍心，不爲名，不圖報，不自以爲有功德，此名爲無相，方爲眞功德。又有彌陀經說，不可以少善根福德因緣得生佛國，這一句經是說臨終念佛，一心不亂，蒙佛接引，是大不容易的事，須是多生行善，有此善根福德以爲助緣，方能臨終念佛一心不亂，若是善根福德太少，還辦不到，到臨終時，各種惡緣忽然凑集，決不能安心念佛，決不能一心不亂，不明此理之人，以爲念佛　業往生，是很容易，平日就不努力廣修靦德。所以如來很鄭重的加此　句，敎人念佛不可忽略修福助行，須要平日常常發大悲心，布施修福，同時精進念佛，方能臨終心不顚倒，往生纔有把握。</p>

<p>與考的小學生五六年級各約四百人，分七個敎室銀行，考試時候，各敎室內部寂靜無聲，秩序井然，足證他們平時都能用功求學。</p>
<p>在八百餘小學生中，各省各地的籍貫都有，以江蘇省佔大多數，其决爲浙江，此外包括粵·鄂·皖·豫·閩·冀·贛·魯·和南京天津等省市。年齡統計，五年級以八歲為最幼，十六歲爲最大，六年級以十一歲爲最幼十七歲爲最大。</p>

<h3 id="c52">冬賑座談會　本報召集 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>前言</p>
<p>目前「冬賑」一事，不待闡釋，已盡人皆知其時機迫切。上海特別市政府發動之冬賑運動，近正積極策進。惟如何更求迅赴事機，早收實效？以及如何周密合理，增加效率？不無討論之價値。本報以與論界立塲，當有及時獻言之責。爰於日昨特邀熱心社會事業諸君子，舉行冬賑座談會。紀略如次：</p>
<h3 id="c53">意見彙錄　發言行後為序 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>榮柏雲先生</p>
<p>（一）目前上海各佈賑團體之間，缺乏聯繫，各自爲政，不免弊實發生，例如施衣一項，時有重複之處。狡黠者領到衣服後，往往變賣金錢，而忠實者無衣可領。以致因組織不良而發生之矛盾，傳播社會，足使捐輸者望而却步。此種缺點，亟應調整。鄙意可利用保甲組織，在某一時閒內全埠同時撤底調查待賑者之確實數目，然後將所募集之衣物，根據調查，平均支配，較爲合理妥當。</p>
<p>（二）待賑者有赤貧與隱貧兩種，對於赤貧救濟，宜從積極方面着想，籌謀治本辦法，例如移殖歸農，開墾土地，能自食其力。浙江之三門灣，頗有廉價土地需要人力墾種，大可加以利用，至於隱貧階層，則利用保甲組織，詳細調查確實，酌量予以救濟，使之生活安定。</p>
<p>（三）人生之究極目的，在爲人類謀幸福，因之平素行事，務須利己利人，積德者其後必昌，屢見不爽，今日之暴發戶，如其子弟坐享遺業，不治生產，造成高等游民，實爲社會之累贅，社會必須减少消費分子，才能健全，施賑亦須本此意義積極引導生產。</p>
<p>（四）社會事業非無辦法。盡力服務者實少。冬賑一事，既有市政當局發動，應與社會圖體密切合作，組設聯合機構，賑款賑物均作總集合與總支配，則收效必宏。</p>
<p>王叔賢先生</p>
<p>（一）市府發動冬賑，預定經費二百萬元，一百萬元已準備妥當，一百萬元尚須向各方募集，本人深覺冬賑已甚迫切，以時日而論，僅有二星期左右。似以名之「春賑」爲適當·賑濟一事，應於事前早早準備，方不致臨時怱忙。</p>
<p>（二）普通施賑，約爲三事：即施粥，施衣，與庇寒所。今後不必因襲成規，應變換方法以適應環境。例如：舉辦小本貸金，亦甚需要。此乃從積極方面着想，能使之自食其力。</p>
<p>（三）辦賑應注意三要點，一不能糜費公款，一須用於實在，爲衆目所見，三未得捐款人同意勿宣佈捐款人姓名。</p>
<p>（四）希望當局能用行動力量，將所有游民集中，移往他處，從事開墾，雖所實經費甚巨，但此有意義有價值之治本辦法一勞永逸，必得各方贊助。</p>
<p>（五）捐得賑款，宜擇要儘先動用，以事實爲宜傳，而引起捐輸人興趣，同時，如有事實表現，亦不愁無人捐款。如固中捐款數目，不達目標，按款不動，一方面事務費源源支出，則恒有事業未辦而賑款日少之弊病。</p>
<p>張一鵬先生</p>
<p>（一）貧苦者可分爲兩種，一爲殘廢及年幼者，祇能養之敎之，二爲成年而且能做事者，應以工代賑，務必使之生產。</p>
<p>（二）辦賑濟事業者有三方面·出錢者，出力者，與工作人員。其中工作人員，尤爲重要。既須熱心任事，又具負責精神。鄙意以窮儒担任，較爲適當，因窮儒具骨氣，盡廉潔，有計劃，願苦幹。</p>
<p>（三）昔年施了英，盛杏蓀，馮夢花，魏家驊等，皆爲辦理施賑著稱者，能任意收羅精幹人才，所以成績極佳，爲各方稱道。</p>
<p>（四）辦理施賑，最好在若干受賑者中，委託一人暗中調查，其餘之受賑者，有無浪費及不盡不實之處，作爲報告，交由主持者審閱視查，此項調查，應由受賑者輪流，較爲有效。</p>
<p>潘仰堯先生</p>
<p>對於問題大綱，所列各點之意見。</p>
<p>（一）喚起社會注意，莫大於報紙宣傳，不斷發表文字，並請社會先進，發表短論。</p>
<p>（二）施賑應從積極的生產方面着想，日本有名「授產塲」者，亦屬此意，例如工藝販賣等，均應有一種短期訓練，使之能直接生產。</p>
<p>（三）籌募經費，雖方法甚多，但尤宜注意於娛樂塲所，實取之不爲虐。支配方面，鄙意敎育應占百分之三十，醫藥百分之二十，施粥百分之二十，貧民食堂百分之十，較爲合理。</p>
<p>（四）施賑對象，應注意老幼，尤應注意救濟老年，調查務求實在、俾免受欺。</p>
<p>（五）管理賑事者自重人品，應重視公款，絕對不能揮霍。有聯云：「揮霍公財，天誅地滅；侵吞善款，男盜女娼。」茲以爲是。</p>
<p>林康侯先生</p>
<p>冬賑一事，鄙意亦從積極方面著手爲要。施衣，施粥，在此隆冬，固當酌辦，但舉辦獎學金，小本貸款等，更有意義，其中以慈幼敎養，兒童敎育，托兒所等，尤爲重要。蓋兒童爲國家未來之主人翁，非特別注意培育不可。希各方推進，爲兒童造福。</p>
<p>許冠羣先生</p>
<p>（一）冬賑工作，應多辦積極的事業，目前急切需要的，無過於施粥，醫藥。此為救濟貧病同胞之急務。街頭之流浪兒童，應予以敎養之機會，與其養之，不如敎之。一方造就有用之人才，亦所以减少社會之不良分子。</p>
<p>（二）冬賑團體，密切聯擊，分工合作，疊床架屋之事業，應予避免，最要在通力合作，以增進施賑之效能。</p>
<p>（三）支配數額，應有合理化之方法。凡敎育、醫藥、以及提倡生產工藝，小本貸金之事業，應有合理之分配。</p>
<p>（四）辦理冬賑人員，應操守廉潔、不可侵蝕，更不可虛糜，尤應會計公聞，昭示大公，俾貧民得霑實惠。如果取信於社會，則以後辦理籌募時，更易如反掌。</p>
<h3 id="c54">問題大綱 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>（一）冬賑時間已甚迫促，應如何喚起之社會再注意？如何分頭迅速推進？</p>
<p>（二）辦理冬賑之機關及團體間，應如何密切聯繫，討論一致辦法，加强施賑效能？</p>
<p>（三）冬賑經費，應如何普遍籌募？支配數額，應如何合理規定？施賑事務，應如何迅速實施？</p>
<p>（四）施賑對象，應如何入手調查？分別緩急先應辦理？</p>
<p>（五）衣物徵集與保管方法，如何使其科學化？</p>

<h3 id="c55">歸納要點 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>（一）冬賑爲期迫促，可改稱春賑。</p>
<p>（二）各施賑團體，應有聯合組織。賑款賑物，總收總發。辦理冬賑機關，應與賑務團體，取得聯絡。</p>
<p>（三）賑務辦有成績，捐款不難籌集。賑款隨捐隨收，以賑濟之事實，引起捐款人踴躍情緒。如不達捐款目標，即不先運用，足使捐款人减少興趣。籌募經費以娛樂塲所爲主，取諸不爲虐。</p>
<p>（四）辦賑應注意：不糜公款。用於實在。未得捐款人同意，不爲發表姓名。</p>
<p>（五）施賑對象爲赤貧與隱貧兩種，赤貧者又分爲殘廢老幼及成年二種。殘廢老幼，祗能敎之養之，成年者採用治本辦法，移農墾殖，或授以技藝，以工代賑，使之生產自立。隱貧者，利用保甲組繼經確實調查後，予以救助。</p>
<p>（六）施賑事項，以有積極及生產性者爲先，如助學金，小本貸金等。</p>
<p>（七）辦賑人才，以積學窮儒最爲適宜，能操守廉介，熱心負責，根據學騐，善爲策盡。</p>

<h3 id="c56">工作和報酬 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 春秋</p>
<p>我正在構思，預備寫作時候，妻的一位朋友來了。</p>
<p>妻和朋友談話，從戶口米的不够，請到軋油，軋糖。那朋友似乎羨慕似乎感慨地說：「上海待遇最好的地方，要算××了。我的鄰居有個兒子，剛二十歲，進去實習了半年，現在起碼薪水就是二千元另外還有房貼·米貼·煤貼·油貼。而目工作輕鬆着說：「我看是苦要算是寫文章了。整天紋腦汁，就是有人要，一千字也值不到二升米」</p>
<p>一個人是矛盾的，有時候，「做一行，怨一行；有時候，却「做一行，貪一行」。整天寫作，仍不能餬口，自不免「做一行，怨一行」。有時候，與到寫了一篇比較自滿的文字，却又敞帚日珍，「做一行，貪一行」了。</p>
<p>識到工作和報酬，別說這一行跟　一行，有天淵之別。就是在同一機關裏，也不能有合理的解決。俗話所說：一吃力不拿錢，拿錢不吃力」便一針見血了。就政治機關來說吧，一向報酬最苦的是科員，而工作最繁重的也是科員。高級官史，有些收入很豐，却在交際，應酬方面下功夫：</p>
<p>就商業機關來說吧，報酬最苦的是低級職員，而工作最繁重的也是低級職員。至於總經理·經理。協理·襄理。科長等，薪水大，津貼花紅更多：有些整天閒着，僅蓋蓋圖章：有時却利用地位，大做投機生意。</p>
<p>再就各行來比較吧，近四五年來，有些機關的職員薪水，提得很高：津貼花紅之多，更使八難以相信。有許多機關，却苦得要命，薪水加各種津貼，還及不上那些「肥」機關的茶房所得之尾數。同在一個地方，同樣地努力工作，有時還做更多的工作，而報酬方面，却相差如此之多，天下事之不公平，孰有甚於此者！</p>
<p>綜上所述看來，同一機關的薪水，應該打破積習，以工作的繁簡爲標準，而定報酬的等級。至於同一地　的各公私機關，也應該訂定一公同標準，使工作和報酬有一合理的解決。這檢，才可配合戰時體制。吾則，肥的太肥，瘠的太　；　數人享福，多數人抱怨，對於總力戰的實行，是有絕士妨礙的</p>
<h3 id="c57">評「飛太子空襲珍珠港」 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 劉鬯</p>
<p>長篇卡通一飛太子空襲珍珠港」及記錄片「天空神兵」在大華試映，記者得戲東一枚，得以先睹爲快，歸來執筆綴成此記，愛爲介紹。</p>
<p>「飛太子空襲珍殊港」，述飛太子率領爆擊隊員狗，猿，……向敵人艦隊大舉進攻，故事滑稽突梯，頗爲動人。全片結構，大致已臻上乘，但缺點，當然不能說絕無。故事，局部地雖滑稽令人噴飯，整個說來，却還嫌太沉悶。把滑稽諷刺畫　　組織起來，籍畫面簡單地傳達其宣傳任務而已。例如寫敵方主力，到處只以猪似的大肚子美國艦長爲代表，只有寥寥幾個塲面，才出現了水手，（千篇一律的影子似的水手）。這就令人起不眞實之感，覺得是故意這樣安排好，叫觀衆洩憤的。舊戲常常有這種筆法，先寫番將的勇猛，然後，再用一位中原的英雄來壓倒他。「飛太子」的缺點就在這里：飛太了舉兵攻去，敵人毫不抵抗，軍艦停在海當中任你轟炸，如入無人之境，這　，飛太子的　風也就顯不出來了。這些地方，我覺得是還値得商討的。</p>
<p>至「飛太子的卡通技　，我覺得也有同樣缺點，就是太連環圖書化。例如飛機，照我想來，應該先置遠景，襯以　碧的天空，先是小黑點子，慢慢的，越飛越近……這樣，就比較地像眞。但是，「飛太子」中，達景幾乎是沒有的，飛機老是充滿着整個畫面，殊爲惹眼。又如魚雷，拍了魚雷，別的就全不顧到了，水面上，既無雲彩，又無如綫的遠山以爲點綴，空空洞洞，就只有魚雷。面且，水也不像眞的水。美國片中不以爲奇的光影作用，這里是沒有的，但見許多波紋在一高一低而已。人物，畫得更爲簡陋。笑就只會拉開　動動，完全是粗綫條約。比起「木偶奇遇記」來，似乎有小巫見大巫之感。</p>
<p>比較成功的，倒是記錄片「天空神兵」。該片寫傘兵訓練的步驟，頗爲詳細，先告訴我們降落傘的構造，其次，介紹傘兵訓練的實况，如何訓練頭不昏，如何訓練跳下姿勢，落地時如何打滾，每組六人，跪下時速率如何齊一……等等。體格檢查後，看見傘兵們一個個爬上飛樣實地演習去了，接着，是用快慢鏡頭介紹實地演習的狀况。作爲記錄片，是値得一看的。</p>

<p>現在鋁的用途，大部分是用來製造鋁合金，而所採用的別種金屬，也大有講究，不同的金屬，製成的鋁合金，其硬度强度都大有不同。甚至用同一金屬，與鋁配合的成分的多少，也會製成截然不伺的鋁合金來。於是，爲了應付各種機械不同的需要，對鋁合金的製造，便常常在花樣翻新，層出不窮。直到現在，鋁合金已成爲很重要的合金，其種類之繁多，實在驚人。不過，就它的製造方法來說，大概可以分爲「鑄合金」和「鍛合金」兩種，這業然已經成爲一種專門的學問，但略爲提綱挈領的談一談，也還是很値得留意的常識。</p>
<p>現在舉義個例子來分別叙述一下：</p>
<p>甲　鑄鋁合金</p>
<p>鑄鋁合金的種類很多。，通常可以分爲三種，</p>
<p>第一種：鋁和銅的合金在這種合金中銅的含量的是由四％——十四％，其中以含八％的最爲通用，即所謂的「十二號合金」（No.　12　Alloy）多用在汽車零件的製造方面。例如：曲拐箱，油箱，踏板，遮　，手柄和支架等，每年的消耗量，大爲可觀。其他像街車的車廂，製橡皮輪的胎型等，也有很多是用牠做的，「十二號合金　的抗拉强度的每方吋一九（〇〇〇——二三〇〇〇磅。</p>
<p>第二種：鋁和鋅的合金一通常鋅的含量由三％到三五％，抗拉强度隨鋅量而變，由最鋁鋅合金價錢較低，但以容量用處較少。</p>
<p>第三種：鋁合釸的合金鋁釸合金，椒近幾年來　發現的一種，釸的含量多爲五％——十五％，這種合金除了比較鋁合金更堅目輕，又不易而外，還有一個優點就是凝固時收縮很少，　此極適宜於鑄造更複雜的　件，結果比用「十二號合金好得多了。</p>
<p>除以上所說的三種合金以外，還有很多的　鋁合金是用三四種或者更多的金　製成的，這一類的合金大多數是爲了適應某一種特殊需要而做成功的，在這裏不再多舉例了。</p>
<p>乙　鍛鋁合金</p>
<p>鋁合金所以能夠　工業上有今日的鞏固地位，一半是由於荷爾的廉價電冶鋁法的發明，另外的一半原因不得不歸功於　鋁合金製造的成功，因爲　鉅台金的優點很多，尤其是在強度方面不但比鑄鋁合金要高，就是最硬的所謂低炭素鋼，比起它來也是望　莫及。所以鍛鋁合金的發明可以說是在冶金方面的一件偉大成就，第一種鍛鋁合金爲一九一一年威爾所發明的硬鋁（Duraluinin），牠的成分大的是銅三·〇％——四·五％，鎂〇·四％——〇。五％錳〇·〇％——〇。七％，其餘爲鋁，由於它的硬度大，質量輕（只有鋼鐵三分之一）是製造飛機的主要材料，硬鋁中如加多一·二五的釸　便成超硬鋁（Super-aluinin）比硬鋁更加堅强。</p>
<p>鍛鋁合金的製造方法，與鑄鋁合金不同的地方，是：除了熔鑄之外，還要適當的變化其溫度，使它漸漸　化，再有高熱之後，急放入冷水裏面，（所謂淬火法）使它變硬，而成一硬鋁一，這樣鍛成的鋁合金，它的硬度，可以更增加一倍以上。每方吋的抗拉强度，有五</p>
<p>這種極大的强度，和極大的重量（不及鋼鍛的三分之一），便使它受到航空工業的特別重視了。</p>
<p>第一次歐洲大戰時，英國國立物理實驗室（BriuishNatioual　Phosical　Laboratory）發現了一種新合金，叫做「Y合金」（Y.　aUoy）這種合金的特點椒牠對於熱量的傳導極易，並且雖在高溫下，牠的強度仍然和　溫時相差不多，因此一般都拿來做爲製造活塞（Piston）的材料。牠的成分是鋁九二·五％·銅四％，　二％，鎂一·五％，Y合金硬化後牠的抗拉強度達每方市四〇·〇〇〇—六二·〇〇〇磅。近年更發現一種合金含矽一二％—四％·鋼一。％，鎂一％，鎳一％—二％，除具有上述性質外，還有低度膨脹的特點，並且比Y合金還要輕四％—五％左右的樣子，有極佳良的耐磨性質，更適宜於作製造活塞的材料。</p>
<p>此外，極高純度的鋁有極高的抗蝕性。所以通常都把極薄一＃的純鋁　在硬鋁的表面，以增加硬鋁的抗蝕性，而所加的純鋁層可以得到和硬鋁同樣的强度。這種材料叫做夾層鋁合金（Alc　Iad）多用於飛機飛艇的表皮的的製造。</p>
<p>以上還不過就鋁合金的製造和品　，約略介紹一下，實際應用的變化，還遠不止此，但總之，鋁合金由於其強度大·質輕，和高度的抗蝕性種種優點，在工業中獲得極鞏固的位置，以前用鋼鐵所製造的物件，現在已經很多改用鋁合金來製造了，大有扶搖直上，凌駕一切之概，　至有人說：「考察一國對於鋁的消費量的大」小，可以衛定牠軍備的　劣」</p>
<p>這話　未必盡然，　鋁這種金屬，將成爲國防工業最重要因素之一，却是毫無疑義的了。（酬移濟貧金）</p>

<p>— Jamcs　Hiltno著　依今譯</p>
<p>吉普斯從校中較爲寬暢的和家眷同住的　舍搬到了原來住過的獨身者的宿舍。他起初想不再當舍監，但是校長却另外勸說着他；後來他快樂了。這種工作給他有些事情做做，在他的心靈上填滿了空虛。他不同了：大家都注意到這點。正像結婚使他有所增加那樣，悼亡也使他有所增加；經過了悲哀的麻木以後，他突然變成了另外一個人，學生們，不論怎樣，都毫不疑地稱他爲「老」。這不是說他不大活動了，，他在板球塲上還能够一逞身手；也不是說他在工作上失去了任何興趣或精銳。還有，實際上他的頭髪多年來已經灰白了；可是只有到現在，似乎大家才注意到牠。他五十歲了。他在努力運動的時間內，能够玩得和只有他一半年齡的人一樣好，有一次，他玩過之後，聽見一個學生說，「像他那樣一個老孩子，一些也不算壞。』</p>
<p>吉普斯過了八十歲之後，一想到這句話，總不覺咯咯地笑起來。「五十歲就算老了，是不是？呃哼—說這話的是那拉（Naylor），那拉自己現在離五十歲不遠了吧！我不知道他還會不會想五十歲是這樣一個大年齡？上次我聽到他，他在當律師，律師是長壽的—看八十二歲還當律師的哈爾斯培利（Halsburg）—呃哼—張雪樓（Chanceher），到九十九歲才死。這就是—呃哼—給你的年齡！在五十歲是太老了呀！像那樣的傢伙在五十歲是太年輕了。…我自己…不過是一個嬰孩…」</p>
<p>這話在某種意味上說來是眞實的。因爲新的世紀一開始，吉普斯就達到了圖熟的地步，將他所有的正在　展着的舊習　，和他那一再陳述過的老笑話，融成了一個單純的和諧。在紀雜上，他不冉有那些輕微而偶發的麻煩，對於他的工作和價値，也不再有什麼過慮。他覺得他在勃洛克菲爾　的尊榮反映了出來，在他自己的身上和他的地位上，給了他足以尊榮的原因　（二十）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Streamlining Government <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>After entering the war, China has entered a new international environment. On the one hand, it is working more closely with Japan, and on the other hand, it must begin to use its own strength to solve its own problems. Under this political situation, all departments of military affairs, political affairs, economy, and diplomacy require the government to be refreshed and political efficiency to be strengthened. For the past two weeks, this newspaper has systematically elaborated and suggested solutions to political, economic, military, diplomatic, and people's livelihood issues in order to strengthen administration. However, we must also point out that to strengthen administration, we must thoroughly implement streamlined government in all departments.</p>
<p>The opposite of streamlined government is complexity, chaos, and corruption, as exemplified by the current Chongqing regime. In terms of institutions, there are overlapping structures, creating a facade of a small court; in terms of personnel, there are idle and redundant staff everywhere, to the point where an official document takes a long time to circulate, achieving nothing. In solving various problems and promoting undertakings, there is often shirking of responsibility and procrastination. This has resulted in sluggish institutions, lack of coordination, no distinction between diligence and laziness, no basis for assessment, lax discipline, and unfair rewards and punishments. Unseemly behavior is everywhere, and complaints fill the court and the countryside. Moreover, with many institutions and personnel, expenses are huge, and funds are insufficient. On the one hand, the government issues currency indiscriminately as a way to inject funds, creating the danger of malignant inflation; on the other hand, it makes law-abiding people so poor that they cannot support their families. Those who are slightly more active can only maintain their lives by holding multiple jobs, and the selfish and self-interested engage in sideline businesses, using their official positions to set up nets and make a fortune from the national crisis. With such resentment from both heaven and man, how can one talk about improving administrative efficiency? The Chongqing regime's perverse actions are indeed not worth regretting; however, the governments at all levels in the peace zones must take the scourge of the Chongqing regime's ignorance of streamlined government as a warning.</p>
<p>The first key point of "streamlined government" is the four big words "simple laws, convenient people." Originally, "simple government, clear laws" was a maxim for governing in our country, meaning that administration should be simplified so that the people feel more grateful than fearful, and then the government will actually achieve results. The Chongqing regime does not understand this at all. The government has one policy today and another tomorrow, issuing one regulation today and another law tomorrow, with all-round control, especially meticulous control. However, the result of such complex laws and strict punishments is that contradictions and conflicts arise from time to time, creating a reality that harms the country and the people. We must now reverse what the Chongqing regime has done, and we must not establish new laws or set up new regulations, but strive to simplify laws and regulations to meet the needs of the new era. At the same time, we must understand that laws and regulations are not rigid and unchanging things. Anything that is beneficial to the country and the nation and convenient to the people must be preserved and promoted for implementation. Anything that, due to the changes of the times, is detrimental to the country and the nation and inconvenient to the people should be revised or abolished. If we can examine and adjust the current laws and regulations according to this standard, it will definitely be easier to implement and will also achieve political efficiency.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is natural to streamline institutions and dismiss redundant staff. As for the former, as long as no new institutions are set up, the existing institutions must be adjusted, and it is not possible to be reluctant to give up this or that. Unnecessary ones must be resolutely abolished, similar ones must be merged, and large ones must be streamlined. In short, we must not create a grand facade, but must be simple and reasonable. As for the latter, it lies in achieving the two words "lean and capable." The standard for employing people should not be based on personal connections, but only on work ethic, responsible attitude, and ability to handle affairs. All idle positions that only receive salary but do no work, redundant staff who receive high salaries but do little work, and those who are not proactive or qualified should be reduced regardless of their position or the influence of their introducers. Only by completely separating government agencies from charitable organizations that provide relief to the unemployed can the government not abandon a useful person or waste a useful effort. As for the dismissed personnel, they should be assigned to productive enterprises according to their strengths, or transferred to suitable jobs, or given special training to become specialized talents. Some people say that after entering the war, political work must be a hundred times busier than before, and the result of streamlined government may not be easy to cope with. In fact, this is a "knowing one but not knowing the other" argument. The busyness of work in various departments after entering the war has long been expected. The promotion of work depends first and foremost on careful planning and a spirit of hard work, and it cannot be achieved by setting up more institutions and adding more personnel. On the contrary, precisely because the work of all departments must be strengthened after entering the war, it is even more necessary to implement streamlined government in order to meet the requirements after entering the war. It must be understood that the current international war will be a long-term war, and comprehensive plans must be made in terms of economy and materials, and expenditures must be saved and inflation must be prevented. After the implementation of streamlined government, with the removal of mediocre talents, the truly talented can achieve something, and there is no need to fear that there will be no one to handle affairs. Using limited people to do unlimited things is the greatest characteristic of the political success of Japan and Germany in recent years, and it is truly worth learning from.</p>
<p>However, the ultimate goal of streamlined government is to strengthen administrative efficiency in order to adapt to the new situation of the new era, and to have more sufficient strength to undertake the dual task of building a new China and assisting friendly nations in winning the victory in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the following points must be taken into account at the same time: First, what we call "streamlined government" does not mean that it should be handled by a few people; handling by a few people will never have good results. The experiences and lessons in Chinese history have long proven this point, and the Chongqing regime's handling by a few people, one party, one faction, or even one family, and the disastrous results it has reaped, are indeed a living example. We must reverse the practice of handling by a few and instead cooperate, especially in streamlined government, we must pay attention to the concentration of talents from all parties, so that we can do the most with the fewest people. First, the original experts and existing talents must be concentrated and recruited, but what is especially important is the cultivation of new talents. Not only should we cherish the talents who have already been trained and achieved success, but we must not be wasteful or mistreat them. Not only should we have a heart of cherishing talents, but we should also seek talents from all aspects and protect them, and at the same time, we should actively cultivate specialized talents in accordance with the current and future needs of the country. If people are used properly, adjusted appropriately, and the virtuous and capable can display their talents, and the mediocre and foolish can be educated, then administrative efficiency will naturally improve. But we must also pay attention to the third point: to establish a truly representative institution as soon as possible to supervise administration. Only in this way can the significance of streamlined government be truly perfected, and the efficiency of administration can be improved, and the major tasks of the present can be undertaken calmly.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Axis Forces in Tunisia Repulse French Dissident Forces and Occupy Several Important Passes in the Atlas Mountains; Tripoli Forms a Solid Defense Line West of Mel <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th, Huitong News Agency: Military sources stated yesterday that the Axis forces have occupied several important mountain passes on the eastern slopes of the Atlas Mountains, capturing 2,500 enemy soldiers. Since January 18, the Axis forces in southern Tunisia have been on the offensive. The troops under Tego have been driven out and retreated into the mountains. After four days of mopping-up operations, the enemy soldiers were completely cleared.</p>
<p>Tangier, 24th, Huitong News Agency: The Allied Forces Command in Algiers announced last night that the French rebel army on the Tunisian front is now continuing to retreat and is reorganizing in the area from Oseltia to Keiroan.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th, Central News Agency: According to sources in North Africa, the Axis forces in central Tunisia continued to launch an offensive on the 22nd, suppressing enemy forces everywhere. A part of the enemy forces in that area has been surrounded by the Axis forces. In addition, the Axis armored units on the Libyan front also repelled an enemy offensive on the 22nd. Another Axis unit attacked the flank of the British army. The British army was unable to withstand the attack and fled, abandoning several armored vehicles and transport vehicles. The rear guard of the Axis forces, in order to facilitate the strategic retreat of Rommel's army, fiercely attacked the enemy forces that had entered the Axis positions. After a fierce battle, the enemy forces were repelled, and the enemy forces were prevented from attacking the important defense line on the Axis side. In addition, the enemy forces that secretly landed west of the German positions on the night of the 22nd suddenly attacked the German forces fighting along the coast from behind on the morning of the 22nd. The German forces immediately counterattacked, annihilating a part of them, and pursuing the remnants, inflicting heavy damage on them.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency: General Eisenhower's timetable for operations was once again disrupted by the Axis forces last week. The hasty eastward advance of American troops on the Tunisian front was not part of their original plan. This is often considered an indirect victory for the Axis powers. General Eisenhower had hoped to carefully deploy everything to await the decisive battle, but the Axis forces suddenly attacked in the Pontu Chang and Luo Ang districts before the appointed day, broke through the French rebel army, and penetrated into the rear of the Allied front line. Therefore, Eisenhower's plan could not be realized at all. If the British army cannot recover some of the lost strongholds, the future is unimaginable. The Axis forces have adopted a fluid and flexible strategy in North Africa. This strategy achieved another important victory last week. After the French rebel army was defeated in the middle of the Tunisian front, the American army immediately rushed to the area. However, the Axis forces had already consolidated their positions and expanded their gains. Therefore, the enemy's attempt to rescue the surrounded troops failed again. The Axis forces' orderly retreat westward from Tripoli is a predetermined plan of the Axis powers. Before withdrawing from the port, the Axis forces completely transported all the supplies and ammunition out, and thoroughly destroyed the port facilities. General Montgomery's purpose of a flank attack was to encircle the Axis forces retreating westward. However, this plan has been shattered by Marshal Rommel's armored units.</p>
<p>Axis Forces Protected by Air Force Retire Safely and in Good Order</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th, Central News Agency: According to sources in North Africa, when the Axis forces withdrew completely from the Tripoli area on the 23rd, they were protected by the air force and were in good order. The army retreated to Tunisia from both land and sea at the same time. In addition, before deciding to abandon Tripoli, the main force of Rommel's army had already safely retreated westward from the area. In order to prevent the Axis forces from retreating, the Allied forces continuously bombed Tripoli with the air force, especially when bombing the port of Suara, 60 miles west of Tripoli, the bombing was the most intense. At that time, a part of the British navy fired artillery at sea, but due to the fierce counterattack by the Axis air force, they failed to succeed. According to another source, a part of Rommel's army has landed in the Bengatan area in southern Tunisia, and it is expected that it will join forces with the Axis forces under the command of Von Arnim.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th, Central News Agency: According to news from the North African front, after the British Eighth Army entered Tripoli, it has secured an advanced air base 220 miles from the Axis supply line connecting the port of Tunis and Sicily. It is reported that the famous German general Rommel has built a solid fortress line in the Mareth Line west of Tripoli, planning to cooperate with friendly forces in Tunisia to jointly defend.</p>
<p>Italy Acknowledges Fall of Tripoli as Expected, Not Surprising</p>
<p>Rome, 24th, Huitong News Agency: The fall of the port of Tripoli has not surprised the Italians. The enemy had a great advantage in numbers, and the occupation of the port was expected. The port is the center of Italian immigration in Africa, and its fall naturally makes the Italians feel quite painful, but it does not have any significant military or economic value. Since the Axis forces occupied Tunisia, Tripoli has lost its strategic importance, and its land is not as fertile as Cyrenaica. Therefore, the British army's acquisition of the area after spending a great price is also not worth the loss.</p>
<p>Active German and Italian Air Forces in North Africa Destroy Many Ships at Sea</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th, Central News Agency: The German authorities explained the war results achieved by the Axis forces in North Africa on the 23rd, stating that the Axis air force bombed 18 Allied ships on the high seas off Algiers on the evening of the 22nd, inflicting heavy damage on them. According to a subsequent investigation, six ships were sunk, totaling 46,000 tons. Several other ships also appeared to have sunk. In addition, Italian air force torpedo planes sank two enemy ships when they attacked the port of Bona in the evening of the 22nd. On the same day, German air force bomber units also attacked the port of Bona, and the port facilities and warehouses were set on fire.</p>
<p>Rome, 24th, Central News Agency: The Italian authorities explained the active situation of the Italian air force on the 23rd, stating that the Italian air force had intercepted four enemy aircraft over Sicily on the 21st, shooting down one enemy aircraft, and the remaining aircraft were also damaged. In addition, the Italian air force patrolling in the central Mediterranean also encountered enemy aircraft at the northeast end of Tunisia and shot down one enemy aircraft.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 24th, Allied News Agency: Yesterday afternoon, General Hata, commander-in-chief of the dispatched army stationed in China, met with reporters and stated that after implementing close military cooperation with the Chinese government, Japan will redouble its efforts to destroy the Chongqing regime and its military strength. This was the first time that the general had met with reporters since China entered the war. When talking about the situation of the Chinese army, General Hata often mentioned that training and military equipment have been greatly improved. As a result, the responsibilities of the Japanese army have been reduced significantly, and it can concentrate on giving the Chongqing army a fatal blow.</p>

<p>Hankou, 23rd, Central News Agency: Since the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, the city has unanimously supported the war, and the details have been reported in previous dispatches. Now, record stores have automatically stopped selling records containing enemy content and records that do not conform to the wartime system. At the same time, entertainment venues and cafes in the city have also stopped broadcasting such records.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th, Central News Agency: According to a dispatch from London, well-informed local sources believe that the United Kingdom and the United States are currently conducting discussions on the political and military situation in North Africa and the establishment of a four-party conference to facilitate a compromise between the Giraud and Darlan factions. At the same time, they hope that Allied Commander Eisenhower can make favorable progress in the stalled operations in Tunisia. Furthermore, in order to prevent incidents similar to the North African problem from occurring and to unify the Allied camp, the United Kingdom and the United States are engaging in consultations with relevant countries to establish a Churchill-Roosevelt four-party conference to guide operations.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th, Huitong News Agency: Swedish newspapers received dispatches from Washington, indirectly confirming that Churchill is once again in Washington. It is said that extremely important talks are currently underway in the United States. Washington officials revealed that these talks involve not only the North African problem, but also the entire issue of cooperation between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. It is heard that cooperation matters between the Allied countries will be presided over by an Allied military conference or a special committee.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th, Central News Agency: According to a dispatch from London, the British government announced on the 23rd that the United Kingdom and the United States are currently conducting certain negotiations, and a decision will be announced soon.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 24th, Havas News Agency: According to recent news from the United States, British Prime Minister Churchill is now in Washington. It is widely believed that Prime Minister Churchill's trip is related to the North African problem.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 24th, Huitong News Agency: A political commentator for CBS said yesterday that the United States has not felt satisfied with the political situation in North Africa. Although Americans have great confidence in the ability of General Eisenhower, they also hope that the political situation in North Africa can be completely clarified as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Giraud May Take an Important Position in North Africa</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th, Huitong News Agency: A special correspondent for a Swedish evening newspaper in London said that well-informed sources revealed that as a result of the Washington conference, General Giraud may be promoted to an important position in North Africa. The situation in North Africa is complex, and without Visford or Churchill personally intervening, there is fear that there is no hope for a solution. Roosevelt and Churchill believe that Giraud's appointment to an important position is the only way to obtain a compromise between the two sides, and London also believes that Giraud's close relationship with Darlan may make the French tend to unity. But in any case, the Vichy faction is arranging to exclude him.</p>

<p>Madrid, 24th, Huitong News Agency: When the newly appointed German Ambassador to Spain, Moltke, presented his credentials to the Spanish leader Franco yesterday, both sides reaffirmed the friendly relations between Germany and Spain and their common determination to fight against Bolshevism in their speeches. Moltke's speech stated, "I am ordered by the head of state of my country to reside in your country as the German Ambassador Plenipotentiary. I am very happy to be able to present my credentials today. On behalf of the head of state of my country, I extend my sincere intentions to Your Excellency. After assuming office, I will work hard to promote the friendly relations between the two countries and, during this wartime, I will devote myself to promoting the inherent culture of Europe. Germany, Italy and Spain have the same consciousness. I still remember when the Spanish people defended their country against the Red Peril, the German Legion fought alongside them. Now the Spanish Blue Division is also fighting alongside the German army on the Eastern Front, jointly protecting the future of Europe. From this, we can see the depth of the relationship between Germany and Spain. Today, taking the opportunity to present my credentials, I wish your country prosperity and your head of state good health." The Spanish leader Franco then replied, "I welcome Your Excellency's appointment by the head of state of your country to reside in our country as the German Ambassador Plenipotentiary, and I hope you will convey my respects to the head of state of your country. The Spanish people admire the heroic and courageous German people for carrying out the historic anti-Bolshevik war. The Spanish people also deeply know the difficulties and great significance of this war, so they are proud of the volunteer army's participation in the Eastern Front and sharing this historical mission. The connection between Germany and Spain should be closer from now on. Wishing your country prosperity and your head of state good health."</p>
<h3 id="e10">German Forces in the Southern Part of the Caucasus Shorten the Front Line and Have Moved Their Positions to the Kuban Valley; German Defense Line in the City of Stalinglad Still Not Destroyed by the Soviets <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th, Huitong News Agency: The great war on the southern route of the Eastern Front has not weakened slightly, especially the Don River region is the center of the soldiers. Although the enemy army has repeatedly tried to extend northward, its main force is still blocked in the western area of the Greater Don Bend. The German army in the southern part of the North Caucasus retreated slightly to avoid contact with the enemy army and to shorten the front line, transferring troops to other places for battle. After the Soviet army saw this situation, it repeatedly tried to hinder the German army's transfer of positions, but it did not succeed. The German army counterattacked in the Don River region, repelling the enemy army and occupying many villages, strictly rejecting the Soviet army's attack. The enemy army south of Voronezh was surrounded and annihilated by us in great numbers. On the Manic Steppe, German tanks met and entered the flank of the enemy army, driving the Soviet army to the east, which was quite successful. The German army in Stalingrad is still resisting the strong Soviet army. The German generals are waiting for the Soviet army's offensive power to weaken, and then they will transfer new troops to defeat it.</p>
<p>German Headquarters, 24th, Huitong News Agency: This year's German war report stated that the battlefield in the northern Caucasus has been moved to the Kuban Valley. Yesterday's Soviet army attack was defeated. The German mountain troops and Romanian troops in the western Caucasus, with the assistance of German aircraft, drove out the Soviet army that had penetrated into our army's territory. Downstream of the Don River, the German army attacked the flank of the enemy army, forcing it to retreat eastward. The enemy suffered heavy losses in manpower and materials. In Stalingrad, the Soviet army continued to break into the western side of the city, but our army firmly held its ground and the defense line has not been destroyed. The enemy's strong force is being held back by our army here, and those who cannot advance belong to the Uzh. The Soviet army, which was attacking fiercely in the Don River basin, was repelled by our tank army, destroying 16 enemy tanks. Southeast of Lake Ilmen, an enemy unit that had been surrounded for many days has now been annihilated. South of Lake Ladoga, the German army resisted the enemy army's attacks from all directions and was quite successful. Our new troops arrived at the front line, and the enemy army that broke into our positions yesterday was completely repelled.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th, Huitong News Agency: The German defense line in the city of Stalingrad has not yet been destroyed by the strong Soviet army.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th, Central News Agency: The Soviet army, from the Caucasus, due to the clever guidance of the German army, arrived at Malville on the 23rd from the west of Voroshilovgrad, and even moved along the Laba River to fight on the upper reaches of the Kuban River. Because there are so many small rivers in that area, it is quite difficult to enter and exit, and the Soviet army is struggling to cope. In addition, the Rokossovsky army in the lower reaches of the Don River also attempted to attack the opposite bank of the Don River at the intersection of the Don River and the Seversky Donets River in Kletskaya. Although they have been constantly crossing the river by force in the past 48 hours, they have not succeeded due to the solid defense of the German army and have suffered great sacrifices. Furthermore, the German army south of Voronezh has blocked the advance of the Soviet army at Nova Aidar, 45 kilometers north of Voroshilovgrad. Since the morning of the 23rd, a large-scale tank battle has been launched.</p>

<p>Argentine Capital, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from Santiago, the Chilean government previously issued a statement saying that although Chile has severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, it will do its best to protect Axis nationals residing in the country. Interior Minister Morales reaffirmed the policy of protecting Axis nationals on the 23rd, stating that after the Chilean government decided to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, President Ríos issued a statement saying that although Chile has severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, Axis nationals residing in Chile can still engage in legal activities within the country. The Chilean government will do its best to protect Axis nationals who do not interfere with Chile's foreign policy. He specifically reaffirmed this intention, stating that banks and companies operated with Axis capital will continue to operate within the legal scope. However, all news and communication agencies that oppose the Chilean government will be closed down. Furthermore, the Chilean Provisional Parliament decided to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers on the 23rd and then adjourned.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - It is reported that isolationist forces in the U.S. Congress have reemerged. According to a dispatch from Washington on the 23rd, Senator Bankhead, a Democrat from Alabama, gave a speech on the 23rd opposing sending U.S. troops overseas. He argued that the United States should devote its main efforts to the production of food and munitions, which would be better used to supply the anti-Axis forces than for U.S. troops to directly engage in war. Therefore, actual combat can be entrusted to the British, Soviet, and Indian forces on the front lines. Bankhead's remarks are considered a typical expression of isolationist views and have caused a great reaction in Washington political circles. In addition, Senator Wheeler, a Democrat who was a leader of the isolationist faction before the war and boldly opposed the government's policy of interfering in other countries' affairs, is said to agree with Bankhead's views and will fully support their implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e20">The Misfortune of Young Students Going to the Mainland <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Shan</p>
<p>Yearning for the rear, not hesitating to travel long distances, living without support, let alone going to school</p>
<p>Last year, when the war broke out in eastern Zhejiang, many young students, yearning for the "freedom" of the mainland, traveled long distances, only to be disappointed, creating a situation where they could neither come nor go. Below are two letters of complaint:</p>
<p>First</p>
<p>With a heavy and sad heart, we read with tears Mr. Yang Gang's article "Students from Zhejiang and Jiangxi in Jianyang." Today, we heard news about us, "drifting students from eastern Zhejiang." We are truly excited and happy because we understand that in this vast and helpless world, there are still fair people who care and sympathize with us. This precious sympathy and care has driven away the decadence in our hearts and given us new hope, just like a child who has suffered humiliation needs to vent the grievances stored in his heart in front of his loving mother. Forgive us for rudely shouting out here a little of the sorrow and indignation that we cannot suppress.</p>
<p>We are not here to lament the hardships of the long journey over the past two months, but we feel lost regarding the rear, to which we had placed infinite hope over the past two months!</p>
<p>There is simply no place to accommodate us. What we have received is only a relief fund of fifty yuan from the "Central Relief Commission." Although the amount of fifty yuan may not seem small in our eyes, how many days can we live on it in Guilin, where the cost of living is frighteningly high? The "Relief Commission" only provides relief once, which is an iron-like rule. It is no wonder that groups of young people struggling on the brink of starvation are running around every street corner. For the sake of our stomachs, we cannot care about our faces, let alone the countless cold pillars that have broken our noses! Alas! We never expected that students in the war zone in the rear would fall to this state! If our parents, who are still in the occupied areas, knew about this situation, how sad would they be! What would people think of the fact that the country has such a large group of young people wandering the streets in a foreign land?</p>
<p>The summer vacation is over, and it is time for school to start. Seeing the rickshaws pulling students into the school, we cannot help but feel sad and envious! As the autumn wind rises, travelers are thinly clothed. Who will sew quilts for us and send us winter clothes? How will we cope with the hunger and cold in front of us?</p>
<p>Some students are preparing to go to Chongqing, but they do not have the financial ability. What can they do?</p>
<p>You understand our feelings best and are most able to sympathize with young people in distress. Therefore, we dare to make an urgent appeal! "Save the displaced and out-of-school youth in foreign lands!" For the thousands of young people who have already come to Guilin and those who have not yet arrived, we make two urgent requests to the agencies that have the obligation to manage and provide relief to students in the war zone:</p>
<p>(1) We hope that the "Central Relief Commission" and educational institutions will quickly advance funds to jointly solve our problems with food, lodging, and schooling, so that we can avoid wandering the streets.</p>
<p>(2) We also hope that the above-mentioned agencies will promptly provide travel assistance to students going west, so that they will not stay in Guilin for a long time and live a painful life. Tong Junchang and 28 other students from Zhejiang Provincial Joint High School</p>
<p>Second</p>
<p>I am a young man who fled from the fortified city of northern Jiangsu to this place. After arriving in Jinhua, I tasted the pain of being out of school and at a loss. In April of this year, the "Ministry of Education" ordered Yingshi University to establish a preparatory class in Jinhua to enroll students, so I was able to study with peace of mind. Unfortunately, after arriving in Lishui, the war in Zhejiang and Jiangxi broke out. In a state of being penniless, braving the heat of the sun, I struggled hard, traveled long distances, and ran to Tancheng in northern Fujian. Fujian Province issued two yuan per day for living expenses. In these times of expensive rice and high wages, how could this small amount maintain food, lodging, and medicine? Being out of school and without support, my pain doubled. Since arriving here, the number of classmates who have died, become ill, or returned to Shanghai has gradually increased. Alas! I never expected to encounter such an experience here, which is truly heartbreaking. But the authorities, do they not love young people and try their best to provide relief to them? But what is the result? Where can we young people voice the grief in our hearts? Who can sympathize with our young people's distress of being out of school and displaced? Judging from the current situation, if the responsible authorities do not quickly and thoroughly resolve the situation, then tens of thousands of us young people will only starve to death! Freeze to death! Die of illness! Suffocate to death! ... I hope you will stand in our position and ask the relevant authorities to find a way to thoroughly settle us.</p>

<p>Suzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Propaganda and Secretary-General of the New Neighborliness Promotion Committee, Mr. Lin Baisheng, arrived at 10:25 a.m. on the 24th to attend the demonstration rally of provincial and all sectors of society supporting participation in the war. Provincial Government Secretary-General Huang, Department Director Zhang Min, Department Director Tang Jian, Department Director Yuan Jiao, Section Chief Ming Xuan, Commissioner Hou, Jiangsu Daily President Feng, all faculty and students of the Propaganda Training Institute in Suzhou, welcomed him at the station. All department heads, secretaries, section chiefs, and military, police, and academic leaders gathered before 10:00 a.m. at the Jiangsu Provincial Education Institute. More than a thousand members of the youth army were lined up on the court by their respective teachers and leaders, and Minister Lin, who was also Secretary-General, inspected them. After getting off the car, Mr. Lin went directly to the reception room of the Education Institute with Provincial Chairman Li and the welcomers. After a short rest, at 10:50, Provincial Chairman Li, accompanied by Secretary-General Huang and Department Director Yuan Jiao, ascended the reviewing stand to inspect the youth team. Professor Zhang Yuansheng, a physical education professor at the Education Institute, directed all the youth students to perform the New National Exercise. All movements were skilled and their spirits were full. After the inspection, a lecture was held in the auditorium of the Institute. More than 700 people, including all department heads, secretaries, section chiefs, and military leaders, attended. After the formalities were completed, Provincial Chairman Li delivered the opening speech, followed by Minister Lin's lecture, titled "The Historical Significance of the Greater East Asia War," in which he addressed the general public's doubts about (1) peace and participation in the war, (2) the causes and consequences of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, (3) the certainty of victory in the Greater East Asia War in terms of military, economic, and spiritual aspects, and (4) how to participate in the war in the meantime. After the lecture, he gave instructions to the youth team, pointing out the two guiding principles in the Education Institute, "Steel Will" and "Iron Unity": (1) "Steel Will" - this will is to restore China and defend East Asia; (2) "Iron Unity" - there must be central leadership and a central belief, in other words, to obey the leader and implement doctrine; (3) To achieve the above two points, there must also be courage, hardship, and endurance. He offered these twenty-four characters to the Three Principles of the People youth soldiers in the county and township areas. Representatives of the Suzhou citizens presented Minister Lin with a signed oath of support for participation in the war and a message from the citizens. Next, a staff officer of the friendly army ×× Division delivered a speech. The meeting adjourned at 12:30. At noon, Mr. Lin attended a public banquet at Provincial Chairman Li's official residence, accompanied by all department heads.</p>
<p>Suzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Propaganda Lin visited the Jiangsu Daily on the afternoon of the 24th at 16:00 and gave instructions to the staff of the Jiangsu Daily, the Suzhou branch of the Central News Agency, and the graduates of the Central Propaganda Training Institute serving in Suzhou. Afterwards, he inspected the Jiangsu Provincial Propaganda Office and left for Shanghai at approximately 19:00 on the 24th. Governor Li and all department heads respectfully saw him off at the station.</p>
<p>Main Points of Provincial Chairman Li's Opening Speech</p>
<p>Suzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - In his opening speech, Governor Li stated that Minister of Propaganda Lin is touring major cities to explain the significance of the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States and the responsibilities that the people should fulfill during wartime.</p>
<p>The purpose of the peace movement is to demand peace and unification internally and independence and equality externally. To achieve independence and equality, we must first find a friendly country. Japan is China's natural friendly country and should cooperate on the basis of the principle of concluding a basic treaty with Japan and issuing a joint declaration between China, Japan, and Manchukuo. Both sides must oppose communism and defeat the Anglo-American forces of aggression in East Asia. In other words, both sides have a consistent foreign policy. After the government declared war against Britain and the United States, our contribution to the Greater East Asia War is greater and our responsibilities are greater. Local administrative conferences, new national movement promotion conferences, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council and the reorganization of government agencies are all adapting to the needs of wartime. In Jiangsu, the provincial county magistrate conference to be held tomorrow will review wartime work. However, Jiangsu may not fully understand the central government's policies and decrees, and some facilities may not have been done first when they should have been done urgently, and some things that were done first may not have been urgent. Fortunately, Minister Lin has brought the central government's intentions, and there will be many profound insights. Now, please listen carefully to Minister Lin's speech.</p>
<p>Main Points of Minister Lin's Instructions</p>
<p>Suzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - At the demonstration rally of all sectors of society in Jiangsu Province supporting participation in the war to defeat Britain and the United States, Mr. Lin Baisheng, the Central representative and Minister of Propaganda, delivered instructions titled "Promote the Spirit of Qingxiang, Support Participation in the War, and Defeat Britain and the United States." The main points are as follows: Today, in Suzhou, the source of the Qingxiang movement, we are holding a mass rally to support participation in the war to defeat Britain and the United States. What I am most deeply moved by is the strong will and enthusiastic emotions that you have shown at today's rally. This will and these emotions have been forged by you in the arduous struggle of the Qingxiang movement over the past two years. You are precisely promoting the spirit of Qingxiang, supporting participation in the war, and defeating Britain and the United States. We must now promote the spirit of Qingxiang to seek the liberation of East Asia and the revival of China. The leader instructed us that the purpose of the Qingxiang movement is not only to ensure the security of a township and a town, not only to achieve democracy in a township and a town, but to ensure the security and improve the people's livelihood in a county and a province, and to ensure the survival and independence of the entire country. To ensure the survival and independence of the entire country, we must also ensure the co-existence and co-prosperity of the entire East Asia. We must expand the feelings of loving our hometown and loving our locality to love China and love East Asia, and combine these feelings into one. We must not only promote the depth of the Qingxiang movement in the vertical aspect, but also expand the breadth of the Qingxiang movement in the horizontal aspect, from one village to one province, from one province to one country, from one country to East Asia. Participating in the Greater East Asia War is to promote the spirit of Qingxiang and expand the scope of Qingxiang. We are using the spirit of Qingxiang to eliminate local bandits, and we must use the spirit of Qingxiang to eliminate the traitors of China, and we must use the spirit of Qingxiang to eliminate the enemies of East Asia. For a century, we have gone through countless tragic wars with foreign countries. In each war, China has sunk deeper into the hell of a semi-colony. Only this war is a war in which the Chinese people are fighting hard to revive China. War has two essential conditions: first, recognize the enemy; second, unite the comrades. Now the relationship between friends and enemies has been clarified. There are only two fronts in front of us: one is the front of the enemies and traitors of East Asia. The Anglo-American imperialists are the enemies of China and the enemies of East Asia. Until now, there are still those who wag their tails and beg for mercy, willing to be running dogs of Britain and the United States, and they are the traitors of China and the rebels of East Asia. On the other hand, the comrades in East Asia are those who, with one hand, bear the vanguard of defeating Britain and the United States and defending East Asia, and with the other hand, unite the Asian nations, aid in the revival of China, return concessions, and abolish extraterritorial jurisdiction. Since the relationship between friends and enemies has been clarified, we can only stand on the side of the East Asian comrades, actively and autonomously, with the qualification of a comrade, share the obligations of war, exercise the power of war, and fight together with our friendly country Japan to defeat the enemies of East Asia and ensure the co-existence of East Asia. Some people say, what strength do we have to participate in the war? We should know that modern warfare is total war. The so-called total strength includes military strength, political strength, economic strength, cultural strength, or a force of decisive battle. We can loudly shout that we have two hands and two feet, which is our strength to participate in the war. We also have the undying conscience of 450 million people, which is our strength to participate in the war. We combine the hearts of 450 million compatriots who want to revive China and defend East Asia into one heart. We combine the hearts of 1 billion East Asian compatriots who want to live and die together and co-exist and co-prosper into one heart. This is our strength to defeat Britain and the United States and defend East Asia. Speaking of this, I remember the rumors of conscription in the past two weeks, which are laughable and hateful. I can solemnly report to you that, first, this participation in the war is a sovereign decision made by the central government based on the established national policy and from the standpoint of a member of East Asia; second, the central government has absolutely no plans to conscript soldiers; third, the friendly government has absolutely no demands to conscript soldiers; fourth, our compatriots are born to revive China and defend East Asia, and they die to revive China and defend East Asia. Every compatriot with blood and every young person with blood, for the survival and independence of the country and for the liberation of East Asia, can only pick up guns and charge into battle together, sacrificing themselves for righteousness, without the need for the government to conscript them, and without the need for the friendly country to demand it. This is the Chinese national spirit, which is the spirit of Greater Asianism. Moreover, there is no such plan or such demand. The leader instructed us on the basic work of participating in the war: first, to popularize the significance of the Greater East Asia War and strengthen the will to defeat Britain and the United States and defend East Asia; second, to ensure security; and third, to increase production. We are confident that you can all, under the guidance of Governor Li, concentrate all your energy on the great mission of reviving China and defending East Asia, and eliminate all running dogs of Britain and the United States, traitors of China, and enemies of East Asia in thought and action, eradicate all bandits who disrupt security, disrupt peace, and obstruct work from the root, and promote all productive work that is beneficial to the revival of China and contributes to the Greater East Asia War on one's own position, bit by bit. We have nothing else to say today. In East Asia, the East Asian nations live together and die together. In China, the Chinese compatriots live together and die together. We can only seek the eternal life of the country and the co-existence of East Asia with the determination and efforts to die together.</p>
<p>Main Points of the Messages from the People of Suzhou</p>
<p>Suzhou, 24th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The message from all sectors of society in Suzhou Province in support of the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States stated: On January 9 of this year, our National Government implemented its national policy and resolutely declared war against Britain and the United States. The people of Jiangsu Province, with the same hatred for the enemy, unanimously support the central government's decision, vowing to work diligently in their respective positions, strive to increase production to enrich military needs, and actively train to strengthen military force. In particular, they will implement the New National Movement, using the national spirit. A representative of the general public telegraphed the Supreme Leader, stating the general situation. Now, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department has personally come to Suzhou to convey the central government's intentions. The people of Jiangsu Province feel even more excited and have held another rally to respectfully listen to his instructions. They are all willing to support participation in the war with one heart and one mind, pledging to devote all their heart and material resources to serve the country. It is hoped that Minister Lin will convey the enthusiastic sentiments he has personally witnessed to the central government, in order to show the loyalty of the people of Jiangsu Province in carrying out the national policy and loving the Supreme Leader.</p>

<p>Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency) - February 5 of this year, which happens to be the day of the old Lunar New Year's Day, will have a total solar eclipse. The path of totality will start northeast of Mukden, pass through Hokkaido, and enter the Pacific Ocean. Beijing will only see a partial eclipse, which will be near the horizon at sunrise and not easy to observe. The date of the solar eclipse is February 5th at 7:05 a.m., with an eclipse of one-ninth. The time of restoration is 7:17 a.m. Therefore, the partial eclipse in Beijing is difficult to observe. In addition, there will be two partial solar eclipses this year, one on February 20th, which will not be visible in Beijing, and one on August 16th, which will be visible in Beijing.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Major Foodstuffs to Have Rationing Expanded, Wholesale Prices Already Controlled, Retail Prices Expected to Stabilize <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of expanding the scope of material rationing in the Public Concession, it is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Materials Control Department is carefully considering it. It is said that the current rationing system for staple foods such as rice, flour, and bread will be expanded to include various other food items within its scope. In terms of the organization of rationing agencies, each industry's trade association, which has already registered with the SMC, will serve as the central point. Once the food rationing system is implemented, items such as clothing will follow suit and be supplied in the same manner. When reporters inquired about this with relevant parties, it was stated that the authorities do intend to place certain new items under the rationing system. However, the specific items are unknown and there is still no information.</p>
<p>Supplies Controlled to Ensure Constant Availability</p>
<p>According to informed sources, the expansion of material rationing has been carefully considered by the authorities for the sake of people's livelihood. Before it is implemented, silence must be maintained; this is a technique for executing official orders. Merchants and citizens need not speculate in advance. In fact, residents throughout the city are eagerly hoping that the authorities will implement rationing for all major food items, similar to household rations. Although the quantity may be subject to deliberation, the stability of prices and the adequacy of supply to meet needs are the primary requirements of rationing. Currently, the control and rationing procedures for various grains, oils, and sugars are being gradually improved, and it is expected that they will soon reach a state of perfection. Furthermore, nearly 300 units of various industry associations in this city have registered with the SMC and established close contact with the Materials Control Department's Association Section, making them an almost ideal central force for the rationing organization in the future. It is understood that all considerations by the authorities regarding the expansion of rationing focus on how to control the supply and ensure its constant availability.</p>
<p>Retail Price Increases Can No Longer Be Justified</p>
<p>It is also learned that the authorities of the two concessions have taken concerted action since yesterday, stipulating that the prices of all items sold by manufacturers and wholesalers should be temporarily based on the prices set on the 23rd of this month, and no increases may be made without prior approval. Manufacturers and wholesalers are also required to submit copies of the prices of various items on the 23rd, along with cost calculations, to the SMC or the Municipal Council's Materials Control Department for record-keeping. According to reporters' investigations, this measure is similar to the regulation issued last year in June or July that the New Legal Tender (fapi) price of goods should not exceed half of the average Old Legal Tender price at the end of May. The difference is that in the past, price controls started with retail goods, while wholesale and manufacturing prices were not involved. The results have been generally seen. This time, the price restriction policy takes the opposite approach, starting with the prices of goods sold by manufacturers and wholesalers. Retail prices will naturally stabilize as the prices of manufacturing and wholesale stabilize, and it will be difficult to justify price increases. This is fundamentally different from the previous method in practice. As for the point that prices cannot be raised without special approval, although there is some flexibility in the price restriction, it will be based on the cost of production. If the timing is necessary, the fixed selling price will be implemented in cooperation with relevant parties and will not be easily changed.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Winter Relief in West Shanghai: Charity Drama to Raise Funds to Aid the Poor <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Various relief associations in the western district of Shanghai are facing substantial funding needs for distributing rice and are compelled to solicit donations from the outside world. Recently, Mr. Feng Bingnan's son, Zhenwei, along with the support of Bureau Chief Bu Lifu, Mo Shaosan, Zhang Beihai, and others, approached the entire membership of the Peace Society (Pinghe She) to participate in performing a charity drama. All proceeds will be used to supplement the winter relief fund. After discussions on the evening before last at six o'clock, it was decided that the Peace Society will perform the charity drama for two days, on the 28th and 29th days of the expired Lunar calendar, with a total of four performances day and night. If the funds raised exceed the ideal target, a portion of the funds will be allocated to make winter clothing in addition to the rice distribution, to alleviate the suffering of the poor at the end of the year.</p>

<p>According to investigations by the Datong News Agency, starting today (the 25th), the Shanghai Municipal Council's (SMC) Goods Control Office will not only send personnel to urge various merchants to quickly submit the selling prices of their goods on January 23, along with cost calculations, for review, but will also dispatch a large number of investigators to secretly investigate price violations and unauthorized price increases at various vegetable markets. As the Lunar New Year is approaching, purchases are expected to be higher than usual. If merchants take this opportunity to reduce the weight or engage in other deceptive practices, they will be severely punished without leniency.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Shen Bao Scholarship Elementary School Group Held Screening Exam Yesterday: Students Arrived on Time Despite Rain and Wind, the YMCA Assisted and Exam Hall Was Orderly, Half of the Scholarship Funds Still Needed <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The fourth Shen Bao Reader Scholarship for the elementary school group held a screening exam at the YMCA yesterday starting at 1:30 p.m. Despite the rain and wind, all students arrived on time to take the exam. In addition to the situation at the exam venue, which is described elsewhere, the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Gratitude to the YMCA for Assisting with the Screening Exam</p>
<p>Regarding the examination matters, the Shen Bao Scholarship Committee commissioned Mr. Ding Guangxun of the YMCA and Ms. Xu Xuehai of the YWCA to preside over the exam. Members of the YWCA who are currently teachers at various schools, including Chen Anying, Gu Yifen, Tao Demu, Lin Huiyu, Lin Yunyu, Wang Shijuan, Wang Shouchong, Jiang Xiulin, Shi Enhan, Rong Shujian, Chen Yafeng, Cai Yaonian, Cai Junnian, and Yu Fuxiu, also undertook the examination duties. Sixteen members of the Shen Bao Scholarship Office also arrived to assist. The exam hall was orderly, and students were seated by number, maintaining good order. The enthusiastic service to the community of Mr. Xu and Mr. Ding is admirable. We are deeply grateful to the YMCA Middle School for providing the classrooms.</p>
<p>Over Eight Hundred Students Took the Exam</p>
<p>Yesterday, the fifth-grade elementary school students took the exam at 1:30 p.m., and the sixth-grade students took the exam at 3:00 p.m., with a total of over 810 students arriving. Over 400 parents accompanied their children to take the exam. The exam was completed at 5:00 p.m. It was found that 14 students were unable to take the exam due to various reasons. Except for those who had previously explained their reasons and had been approved for a make-up exam, the remaining students should have their eligibility canceled immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Scholarship Funds Insufficient <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Considering the students' urgent need for assistance, the staff of this newspaper feel even more ashamed for their limited ability. Examining the list of scholarship applications for this year, there are 421 fifth-grade elementary school students, 394 sixth-grade students, 454 first-year junior high school students, 365 second-year students, 308 third-year students, 157 first-year senior high school students, 150 second-year students, 114 third-year students, and nearly 100 university students (registration is not yet closed). Including the industrial and vocational supplementary group, there are approximately 50 people, totaling over 2,500 applicants. Assuming an average tuition fee of 150 yuan per student, over 300,000 yuan is needed. Even after excluding those who do not meet the academic requirements or whose families are not truly impoverished as verified by investigations, at least over 200,000 yuan in scholarship funds are required. Based on the current scholarship funds available to this newspaper, which are only over 100,000 yuan, it is deeply felt that the ability to provide assistance is not fully aligned with the students' wishes. The purpose of the scholarship of this newspaper is to use the surplus resources of society to help those in society who are unable to help themselves. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will recognize the large number of students in need of assistance and the limited scholarship funds, which is an undeniable fact, and do their best to prevent young people on the verge of dropping out of school from becoming hopeless in their pursuit of education. This is what our colleagues repeatedly appeal to people in society on behalf of those in need.</p>
<p>Exam Questions for Each Grade Level Will Be Published</p>
<p>The fifth-grade exam questions included six language comprehension questions, six sentence-making questions, eight arithmetic questions, eight multiple-choice general knowledge questions, and eight true/false questions. The sixth-grade exam questions included eleven language comprehension questions, eight arithmetic questions, eight multiple-choice general knowledge questions, and eight fill-in-the-blank questions, all to be completed within one and a half hours. Each question equally emphasizes academic subjects and practical social situations. Once the examination affairs are completed, they will be appropriately published.</p>
<p>Donations of Post-dated Checks Are Also Welcome</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from an anonymous gentleman yesterday, stating that, "I have long admired your newspaper's scholarship movement and have made donations in the past. This year, as the Lunar New Year is approaching, cash flow is tighter, but reading the news about the large number of students requesting assistance, I should do my best to donate. Reluctantly, I intend to donate with a post-dated check due on February 15 to help with my accounting turnover and to achieve my wish to support education. However, I am afraid that your newspaper will not accept it according to regulations, so I am writing to inquire." This newspaper believes that the gentleman's concern for education and the inconvenience of disbursing funds at the end of the year are commendable. It can be accepted. If people from all walks of life have similar donations, please notify us by letter, and we will send someone to collect it with an official receipt.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Middle School Group Screening Exam to Be Held on the 27th <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The middle school group screening exam has also been decided to be held on the 27th, still at the YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road. High school students will be examined from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., first-year junior high school students will be examined from 1:30 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., and second- and third-year junior high school students will be examined from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. It is estimated that over 2,000 students will take the exam on that day. All junior and senior high school students taking the exam should bring pens and ink. Third-year junior high school students and above should also bring rulers, compasses, and other necessary tools. Students are expected to arrive on time. If anyone is unable to take the exam due to circumstances, they must come to the office to explain the reason. If it is verified to be true, the exam may be rescheduled; otherwise, eligibility will be canceled.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Enthusiastically Donates Scholarships</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 1:00 p.m., Mr. Zhu Yiyun, a passionate supporter of education, visited the exam venue. He immediately proposed a plan to generously donate scholarships for one elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school student each for this semester. Those with impoverished family circumstances, upright character, and diligence in learning may apply. Mr. Zhu's enthusiasm in braving the wind and rain to come to the venue is truly admirable. Once the exam is completed and the results are reviewed, the plan will be finalized.</p>
<h3 id="e30">The Way to Preserve Wealth (4) <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Nie Yuntai</p>
<p>The author of this article, Mr. Nie Yuntai, is of high age and virtuous character, and a lover of charity and benevolence. In recent years, he has devoted himself to the study of Buddhism, increasingly developing compassion. He lives in simple clothing and eats plain food, being very frugal in his own consumption, but using his surplus to give alms, taking from society to use for society. He is capable of accumulating and dispersing, actively doing good. It is said that the Nie family has prospered for seven generations, sufficient to see that the accumulation of virtue brings rewards, and is by no means achieved by chance. Even if he does not accumulate money for his descendants, his descendants are all able to carry on his ambitions and stand tall, which is sufficient to give our view of life a new inspiration. This article fully elucidates the ultimate truth of "accumulating money" and "doing good," citing facts vividly, and every word and sentence is written from experiential understanding. It is hoped that readers will pay close attention.</p>
<p>(3) Let's talk about Lin Zexu, the Qing Dynasty's Grand Protector, who was the great man who opposed the British, leading to the Opium War. If he had been willing to make a fortune, it would have been easy to make millions at that time. He believed that opium was harmful to the people, so he was not afraid to use drastic measures, burning 20,000 boxes of British opium. Later, when the British attacked Guangdong, they could not break through for a year. After capturing Ningbo and Zhenjiang, the Qing Dynasty had no choice but to dismiss Lin Zexu and send him into exile to apologize to the British and make peace. After Lin's death, his family also had no savings, but his descendants have continued to be scholars for several generations. Descendants even had successful candidates in the Imperial examinations, and some still exist today. Lin Xiang, the former president of the Supreme Court who passed away a few years ago, was also one of them, and their morals are high. This is another proof that not wanting to make a fortune leads to the success of one's descendants. Looking at those who made a fortune at the same time as Lin, I can give several examples, namely the Wu and Pan families of Nanhai, Guangdong, who made fortunes of several million from opium. Many who are familiar with calligraphy and painting know that most of the famous ancient calligraphy and paintings have the seals of the Wu and Pan families, indicating that the items had been kept in the two families' collections, showing their great wealth. Decades later, these precious items have flowed into other hands, and their Phoebe zhennan wood houses have long been dismantled and used as decorative woodwork in other people's homes. Not a single descendant is heard of. The heads of these two families can be considered shrewd and capable, able to make such great fortunes. At that time, Lin Zexu was considered too foolish, unwilling to make a fortune, and instead causing himself to be dismissed and punished. But looking at his descendants decades later, one knows that Lin Zexu was the wisest person in the world, while the Wu and Pan families were the most foolish.</p>
<p>Buddhism takes great compassion as its foundation. Only with great compassion can there be Bodhicitta. If great compassion is not genuine, it is not in accordance with Buddhism. In other words, it is violating Buddhism. Among the myriad practices of Buddhism, almsgiving is the first step to entry. If one is stingy and unwilling to give, then all Buddhist activities done are ineffective in cultivating merit. Therefore, the Medicine Buddha Sutra clearly explains the sins of being stingy and unwilling to give at the very beginning, saying: "There are beings who do not know good and evil; they only harbor greed and stinginess, and do not know about almsgiving and its consequences. They are foolish and ignorant, lacking in faith. They accumulate wealth and treasure, diligently guarding it. When beggars come, their hearts are not happy. If they are forced to give, it is like cutting off their own flesh, and their hearts feel pain and regret. Such people, upon death, are born into the realm of hungry ghosts or the animal realm." They think that even though I am stingy, if I do some Buddhist deeds and merit, I can avoid suffering bad consequences and even be born in heaven and gain blessings. They do not know that Buddhism values sincerity and despises deception. If one creates sins while also spending money to seek exemption from punishment, how can the Bodhisattvas protect such cunning people? Because wealthy people have surplus money and wealth that they have no use for, knowing that many people are starving to death, but they are unwilling to give alms to provide relief, morally speaking, they are indirectly killing people. Those who accumulate the most money, have the most power, but are unwilling to give alms bear a greater responsibility for the crime of killing. For example, if one sees a very small child standing by a well, about to fall in, and a person stands by without saying a word or pulling him away, letting him fall into the well and die, we will certainly say that this child was killed by him. The rich seeing disasters and not providing relief is the same. Especially when the rich are unwilling to give up even a small portion of the interest, then wouldn't the thousands and tens of thousands of starving people dying on the streets be counted as killed by them? How can the sins of killing thousands and tens of thousands of people be atoned for by acting slowly, spending thousands and tens of thousands of yuan on Buddhist activities like printing sutras and building temples?</p>
<p>Emperor Wu of Liang asked Bodhidharma, "Do I have merit for building so many temples and ordaining so many monks?" Bodhidharma replied, "No merit." He said that what he had done was a conditioned cause, so it did not count as merit. What is conditioned? It is acting with intention, not out of a sincere heart. The sutra says, "If the causal ground is not true, the fruit will be crooked," which is the meaning of this. Because Emperor Wu of Liang had committed many sins before, he attacked Jinyang City and drowned 100,000 Wei people with water. Just this one incident makes it difficult to escape bad consequences. Therefore, he resolved to repent, but his repentance was not sincere. His promotion of Buddhism was truly sincere, so he attracted the great master Bodhidharma. The three great laymen, Zhi, Zhi, and Shang, were all manifestations of Bodhisattvas, helping him to preach. These sages were not coming for fame and fortune. It is evident that Emperor Wu of Liang's practice was genuine and not false. The Compassionate Repentance Ritual he compiled, now known as the Liang Emperor Repentance Ritual, was compiled by Princess Zhi and was inspired by Maitreya Buddha in a dream to be named. Today, if people sincerely repent and prostrate themselves in the Liang Emperor Repentance Ritual, or sincerely invite truly practicing people to prostrate themselves and repent on their behalf, it will have a definite effect. Emperor Wu of Liang's resolve was sincere, and perhaps he was inspired by the three great laymen to be even more courageous and diligent. This is very different from what I am talking about now, spending a few thousand or a few hundred yuan on some conditioned merit.</p>
<p>Conditioned merit is false and perfunctory, stingy and unwilling to give, lacking in respect and compassion, and is truly genuine. How can one hope to offset sins with merit? Unfortunately, there are too many people in the world who do not understand this principle, harboring evil thoughts all day long, doing evil deeds, being stingy and jealous, not arousing compassionate hearts, and yet going to the temple every year to perform water and land rituals. They do not know that karma is created by my body, speech, and mind. How can they hire some monks to recite sutras for a few days with the money from creating karma to pay it off? Unless one truly repents, changes one's previous behavior of being stingy and creating evil, and practices good deeds of compassion, joy, and equanimity, then reciting sutras and performing water and land rituals will be beneficial. Because Buddhism speaks of merit, it all depends on the genuineness of the heart. If there is a heart of benefiting others, then all good deeds are genuine. If it comes from a heart of benefiting oneself, then even doing good and making merit, or reluctantly donating some money out of politeness, is considered false. If the heart of benefiting others is very genuine, even if only a very small amount of money is given, it is considered very great merit from the perspective of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Please see what the Earth Store Sutra says, "If a person encounters the lowest poverty, the crippled, the mute, the deaf, the foolish, the blind, such as those who are imperfect in various ways, if they can have great compassion, lower their hearts, smile, give alms with their own hands, and speak softly to comfort them, the blessings that person obtains are as great as the merit of giving alms to hundreds of Ganges sands of Buddhas. Why is this? Because this person has great compassion for the poorest and most wretched, and for those who are imperfect, therefore the reward of blessings is so great." Let us imagine that the merit of burning incense, reciting sutras, and making offerings to one Buddha is considered great. How great is the merit of making offerings to hundreds of millions of Buddhas? Holding a handful of sand, the number is already uncountable, let alone the sand of one river, let alone the sand of hundreds of Ganges Rivers. This means that if ordinary people have great compassion for the poor and suffering, it is tens of thousands of times greater than the merit of making offerings to the Buddhas in the temple. Going to the temple to burn incense is considered making offerings to one Buddha. If one has genuine great compassion, it is making offerings to tens of thousands of Buddhas. The meaning of this chapter in the Earth Store Sutra is rarely understood by ordinary Buddhist believers. If they can understand it, they will not only do the superficial formalities of burning incense and worshiping Buddhas, but will truly arouse great compassion. They will empathize with the poor and suffering, give money for relief, and not be unmoved. Because they do not know this principle, they only spend money to perform water and land rituals and recite Universal Dharma. They are merely spending money to buy merit, the same as donating money to buy official titles in the past. From the perspective of the Buddhas, this is not merit and cannot offset their sins of greed and cunning. Therefore, in the Earth Store Sutra, the Tathagata specifically said, "This chapter on comparing the merit of almsgiving," teaching people to truly arouse compassionate hearts. Therefore, I now advise Buddhist believers to carefully read the Medicine Buddha Sutra and the Earth Store Sutra, to understand the meaning of the sutras so that they do not misunderstand the Buddha's intentions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Avatamsaka Sutra, Chapter on Vows and Practices, also explains that to attain Buddhahood, one must have great compassion for all beings (i.e., all people and things). If one does not have great compassion for all beings, one will ultimately not be able to attain Buddhahood. Also, the Diamond Sutra says that the merit of giving alms without form is immeasurable and boundless. What is meant by without form? It means giving money to do charity, relieving the poor and suffering, out of a genuine compassionate heart, not for fame, not for reward, and not thinking that one has merit. This is called without form and is true merit. Furthermore, the Amitabha Sutra says that one cannot be born in the Buddha's land with few good roots, blessings, and causal conditions. This verse means that reciting the Buddha's name at the time of death, with a single-minded focus, and being received by the Buddha is not easy. It requires practicing good deeds in many lifetimes, and having these good roots and blessings as auxiliary conditions, in order to be able to recite the Buddha's name with a single-minded focus at the time of death. If one has too few good roots and blessings, it will not be possible. At the time of death, various evil conditions will suddenly gather, and one will definitely not be able to recite the Buddha's name with peace of mind, and will definitely not be able to have a single-minded focus. Those who do not understand this principle think that reciting the Buddha's name to be reborn in the Pure Land is very easy, and do not strive to cultivate virtue widely on ordinary days. Therefore, the Tathagata very solemnly added this sentence to teach people not to neglect cultivating blessings and auxiliary practices when reciting the Buddha's name. One must constantly cultivate great compassion, give alms, and cultivate blessings on ordinary days, while diligently reciting the Buddha's name, in order to not be confused at the time of death and have confidence in rebirth.</p>

<p>After the authorities announced changes to the flour allocation method, flour food merchants such as those in the fried food industry and steamed bun industry found themselves in a standstill because few people exchanged flour or flour coupons for various foods, which caused serious problems for their livelihoods. The industry association sent representatives on the 14th of this month to request the revocation of the order. The authorities agreed to consider the request but ordered the industry association to formulate methods to prevent black market trading among its members for review. It is reported that the industry has drafted several methods and submitted them to the authorities. The methods include: (1) "Ten member stores will form a group, and each group will elect one person to investigate the flour allocated by the authorities to the group on a daily basis. If anyone sells the flour on the black market, they should immediately report it to the association, which will then report it to the authorities for arrest and punishment, and their qualification to receive flour will be revoked. (2) The association will establish an investigation team, and five investigators will be selected daily to investigate the sales of each flour food store in five districts. Once the investigators find any irregularities, they will immediately hand them over to the authorities for strict punishment. (3) The directors and supervisors of the association will take turns to be responsible for investigating flour stores and stalls on a daily basis. If the investigators of each group and the personnel of the association's investigation team are found to be engaging in favoritism or corruption, they will be immediately reported for arrest and strict punishment. (4) If the directors and supervisors of the association commit any irregularities or falsely use their names to demand fees from flour food stores and stalls for the flour allocated by the authorities, they are willing to bear joint criminal responsibility." It is also heard that the authorities have ordered the industry association to investigate the amount of flour used daily by each flour store and stall and report it for review.</p>

The reason why it sold out in four days is to meet the urgent needs of residents. As for whether there will be another sale of oil in the oil shops in this city during the Lunar New Year, no accurate news has been obtained. However, according to oil industry personnel, in order to meet the needs of residents during the Spring Festival, it is very likely that the Group A oil shops will sell oil again in the near future. It is also learned that the implementation of the oil rationing system has been drafted and will be announced soon.</p>

<p>The Scottish Cup football match between Donghua and St. Francis was held at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon at 3:30. In the midst of the fierce battle, the weather turned bad and it poured rain. Six thousand fans braved the rain to watch the football skills. The battle continued as usual. Unfortunately, the field was full of water, and the Donghua athletes were unable to use their original tactics in the sorrowful winds and bitter rain, resulting in a defeat to St. Francis. The score was 4 to 2. The historic Scottish Cup was handed over to the opponent. Referee Xuan Gu Zhengzhu, both sides started to contact after selecting positions. St. Francis kicked off but was intercepted midway. Donghua launched a counterattack. Cao Qinfang sped straight into the penalty area. Xu Erzli tried to stop him, turning the danger into safety. However, the battle was still controlled by Donghua. Jia Youliang and Han Longhai both had excellent scoring opportunities. St. Francis had good luck and did not lose an inch of ground. After 40 minutes, Cao Lingfang of Donghua got the ball, passed it lightly to A Dai, who passed over Xuesigu and calmly passed it to A Kui. Xu did not disappoint the crowd and scored quickly, to the cheers of the fans. Soon, Donghua took the lead with a score of 1 to 0 in the first half. After the break, the battle continued. St. Francis, led by Carlo Li Liequ, launched a full-scale attack. Fortunately, Ba Shi hooked the ball and passed it to Carlo Li Liequ, who shot it hard. Zhang Banglun was unable to save it, creating a 1 to 1 tie. At this time, heavy rain poured down, and the weight of the ball also increased. Donghua lost many opportunities in the slanting wind and rain, but St. Francis's offensive became more vigorous. After 30 minutes, Greenburg of St. Francis rushed straight forward. Han Longhai cleverly intercepted and sent the ball far away. Zhang Zhaopeng jumped high and missed the ball. Ba Shi advanced from the left corner, picked up the ball on the center line, and Li Ning could not reach it. Paul shot hard and scored. Donghua was defeated again. St. Francis became even more rampant. Although Donghua tried to counterattack, they were unable to do so. Dai once rushed into the enemy's territory alone. Cao Qinfang was eager to win and was judged offside. With 3 minutes to go, St. Francis's Fu Ende received assistance from W Pantouxun and shot hard into the net. After a while, Carlo Li Liequ still passed through Liang Shutang and calmly shot into the net. St. Francis took a remote lead with a score of 4 to 1. Donghua was still not discouraged. Jia Youliang scored a goal, pulling back a city. Donghua's offensive suddenly became more vigorous, showing signs of resurgence. However, the final whistle had already sounded, and Donghua lost to St. Francis with a score of 2 to 4. St. Francis retained the championship. After the match, the award was given by Kang Boxi, the chairman of the Western Federation.</p>

<p>Amidst the day-long assault of cold winds and rain, over eight hundred children, dressed in various attire and covered in mud, made their way to the Sichuan Road YMCA Middle School. Filled with eager anticipation, they braved the elements to take the elementary school group examination for the fourth Shenbao Readers' Scholarship.</p>
<p>Some of them lived as far away as Pudong, Xujiahui, and Caojiadu, yet they all arrived early for the exam. They did not consider the distance or the rain, but only cherished the hope of continuing their education!</p>
<p>Approximately four hundred students each from the fifth and sixth grades participated in the examination, divided into seven classrooms. During the examination, each classroom was silent and orderly, proving that they usually studied hard.</p>
<p>Among the eight hundred-plus elementary school students, there were students from various provinces, with Jiangsu Province accounting for the majority, followed by Zhejiang. In addition, there were students from Guangdong, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Fujian, Hebei, Jiangxi, Shandong, as well as Nanjing and Tianjin. According to age statistics, the youngest in the fifth grade was eight years old, and the oldest was sixteen years old. The youngest in the sixth grade was eleven years old, and the oldest was seventeen years old.</p>
<p>Their parents accompanied the students. Some were postmen, some were police officers, and most were salaried workers. Among the students, some had lost their fathers, some had parents who were unemployed, and some were orphans who came with relatives.</p>
<p>Students from poor families with excellent academic performance naturally meet the criteria of the Readers' Scholarship, but the number of applicants is too large, and the amount of donations is, in fact, difficult to meet the demand. In order to respect the donations of readers, this newspaper had to conduct a screening exam to select the most deserving students for assistance. However, with the exception of a very small number of students whose scores were below the standard and were eliminated, the rest were mostly above the standard. This situation will make our colleagues unable to make a choice and feel at a loss.</p>
<p>Seeing these scenes, everyone sympathizes, and everyone should fulfill the responsibility of human mutual assistance. Today's diligent and progressive students are tomorrow's outstanding members of society, and also the masters of the country. The future strength of the country and the health of society still depend on these students. Therefore, those who have the ability should cultivate a poor student as much as they cultivate their own children. Therefore, we can only sincerely hope that readers will continue to donate in order to reduce the number of out-of-school children who have excellent academic performance but come from poor families! This group of children from poor families, holding the ardent hope of seeking help, braved the wind and rain yesterday to participate in the newspaper's scholarship screening test. They are ambitious and have a bright future. We should cultivate them as much as we cultivate our own children.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Winter Relief Symposium - Convened by This Newspaper <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>Currently, the "Winter Relief" matter, without explanation, is already well known to all, and its timing is urgent. The Winter Relief campaign initiated by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government is currently being actively promoted. However, how can we seek to respond quickly to the situation and achieve practical results early on? And how can we be thorough, reasonable, and increase efficiency? There is some value in discussion. This newspaper, in its position in the field of public opinion, has a responsibility to offer timely advice. Therefore, yesterday, we specially invited gentlemen who are enthusiastic about social causes to hold a Winter Relief Symposium. A summary is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e53">Summary of Opinions - Speakers are listed in order of speaking <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Rong Boyun</p>
<p>(1) Currently, there is a lack of coordination among the various relief organizations in Shanghai. Each acts independently, which inevitably leads to malpractices. For example, in the case of clothing distribution, there is often duplication. Cunning people often sell the clothes they receive for money, while honest people have no clothes to receive. This contradiction, caused by poor organization, spreads in society and is enough to make donors hesitant. This shortcoming should be adjusted urgently. In my opinion, the Baojia organization can be used to conduct a thorough investigation of the actual number of people awaiting relief throughout the city at the same time. Then, the clothing collected should be distributed equally based on the investigation, which would be more reasonable and appropriate.</p>
<p>(2) There are two types of people awaiting relief: the extremely poor and the hidden poor. For the relief of the extremely poor, we should think from a positive perspective and plan for a fundamental solution, such as relocating them to rural areas and reclaiming land so that they can support themselves. Sanmen Bay in Zhejiang Province has cheap land that needs manpower to cultivate, which can be used. As for the hidden poor, the Baojia organization should be used to investigate them in detail and provide relief as appropriate to stabilize their lives.</p>
<p>(3) The ultimate goal of life is to seek happiness for humanity. Therefore, in our daily actions, we must benefit ourselves and others. Those who accumulate virtue will prosper in the future, as has been repeatedly observed. Today's nouveau riche, if their children enjoy the legacy and do not engage in production, create high-level idlers, which is a burden on society. Society must reduce consumption factors in order to be healthy. Relief must also be guided actively in this sense to promote production.</p>
<p>(4) Social work is not without solutions. There are few who devote themselves to serving. Since the Winter Relief is being initiated by the municipal authorities, it should work closely with social groups to establish a joint organization, and all relief funds and materials should be centrally collected and distributed to maximize the effect.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Shuxian</p>
<p>(1) The municipal government has launched the Winter Relief campaign with a planned expenditure of two million yuan, of which one million yuan has already been prepared, and another one million yuan still needs to be raised from various sources. I feel that the Winter Relief is very urgent, and in terms of time, there are only about two weeks left. It seems more appropriate to call it "Spring Relief." Relief work should be prepared well in advance so as not to be rushed at the last minute.</p>
<p>(2) Ordinary relief work consists of three things: porridge distribution, clothing distribution, and shelters. In the future, we should not follow the established rules, but change the method to adapt to the environment. For example, providing small loans is also very necessary. This is thinking from a positive perspective and can enable them to support themselves.</p>
<p>(3) Relief work should pay attention to three key points: one, not to waste public funds; two, to use it effectively and in a way that is visible to the public; and three, not to announce the names of donors without their consent.</p>
<p>(4) I hope that the authorities can use their power to concentrate all the vagrants and move them to other places to engage in land reclamation. Although the actual expenditure is huge, this is a meaningful and valuable fundamental solution that will gain support from all parties.</p>
<p>(5) Relief funds should be used selectively and as soon as possible, using facts to attract interest from donors. At the same time, if there are facts to show, there will be no worries about not having donations. If the number of donations does not reach the target, the funds should not be moved, and the administrative expenses will be paid out continuously, which will inevitably lead to the problem that the cause has not been done and the relief funds are decreasing day by day.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yipeng</p>
<p>(1) The poor can be divided into two types: the disabled and the young, who can only be supported and educated, and the adults who are able to work, who should be provided with work instead of relief to ensure that they produce.</p>
<p>(2) There are three parties involved in relief work: the givers, the helpers, and the workers. Among them, the workers are particularly important. They must be enthusiastic about their work and have a sense of responsibility. In my opinion, it is more appropriate to have poor scholars take on this role because they have integrity, are clean and honest, have plans, and are willing to work hard.</p>
<p>(3) In the past, Shi Liaoying, Sheng Xingsun, Feng Menghua, and Wei Jiahua were all known for their relief work. They were able to recruit capable people at will, so their achievements were excellent and praised by all parties.</p>
<p>(4) In carrying out relief work, it is best to entrust one of the recipients to secretly investigate the others to see if there is any waste or falsification and report it to the managers for review and inspection. This investigation should be carried out in rotation by the recipients to be more effective.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Yangyao</p>
<p>Opinions on the points listed in the outline of the problem:</p>
<p>(1) To arouse social attention, there is nothing greater than newspaper publicity, constantly publishing articles, and inviting social leaders to publish short commentaries.</p>
<p>(2) Relief work should be thought of from a positive production perspective. Japan has a "production field," which also belongs to this idea. For example, craft sales, etc., should have a short-term training so that they can produce directly.</p>
<p>(3) Although there are many ways to raise funds, we should pay particular attention to entertainment venues, which is truly taking without being abusive. In terms of distribution, I think education should account for 30%, medicine 20%, porridge distribution 20%, and a poor people's canteen 10%, which is more reasonable.</p>
<p>(4) The target of relief should pay attention to the elderly and children, especially to the relief of the elderly. The investigation should be realistic to avoid being deceived.</p>
<p>(5) Those who manage relief affairs should value their character and respect public funds and must not squander them. There is a couplet that says, "Squandering public funds will be punished by God; embezzling charitable donations will make men thieves and women prostitutes." I think this is true.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou</p>
<p>In my opinion, Winter Relief should also start from a positive perspective. Clothing and porridge distribution should be done appropriately in this cold winter, but providing scholarships and small loans is more meaningful. Among them, childcare and education, and nurseries are particularly important. After all, children are the future masters of the country and must be given special attention and cultivation. I hope that all parties will promote this and create benefits for children.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Guanqun</p>
<p>(1) Winter Relief work should focus on more positive projects. At present, what is urgently needed is porridge distribution and medical care. This is an urgent task to relieve the poor and sick compatriots. Street children should be given the opportunity to receive education and cultivation. It is better to teach them than to raise them. On the one hand, we are creating useful talents, and on the other hand, we are reducing the number of social delinquents.</p>
<p>(2) Winter Relief organizations should work closely together, divide the labor and cooperate. Overlapping projects should be avoided. The most important thing is to work together to increase the effectiveness of relief.</p>
<p>(3) There should be a reasonable method for distributing the amount of money. There should be a reasonable allocation for education, medical care, and the promotion of production crafts and small loans.</p>
<p>(4) The personnel who handle Winter Relief must be honest and not greedy, and they must not squander funds. They should also be open about the accounting to show fairness so that the poor can receive real benefits. If we gain the trust of the community, it will be easier to raise funds in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Outline of the Problem <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(1) Winter Relief is very urgent. How should we re-attract the attention of society? How should we promote it quickly in different directions?</p>
<p>(2) How should the organizations and groups that handle Winter Relief work closely together to discuss a unified approach and strengthen the effectiveness of relief?</p>
<p>(3) How should Winter Relief funds be raised universally? How should the amount of distribution be reasonably stipulated? How should relief work be implemented quickly?</p>
<p>(4) How should we start investigating the targets of relief? How should we distinguish between the urgent and the non-urgent?</p>
<p>(5) How should we make the methods of collecting and storing clothing scientific?</p>

<h3 id="e55">Key Points Summarized <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(1) Winter relief is urgently needed and should be renamed Spring Relief.</p>
<p>(2) All relief organizations should have a united organization. Relief funds and materials should be collected and distributed centrally. Winter relief agencies should coordinate with relief organizations.</p>
<p>(3) If relief efforts are successful, it will not be difficult to raise funds. Relief funds should be collected and used as soon as they are donated to create enthusiasm among donors through tangible relief efforts. If donation targets are not met, funds should not be used prematurely, as this may reduce donors' interest. Fundraising should primarily focus on entertainment venues, obtaining funds without causing hardship.</p>
<p>(4) Relief efforts should pay attention to: not wasting public funds, using funds effectively, and not publishing donors' names without their consent.</p>
<p>(5) Relief should target two types of people: the extremely poor and the hidden poor. The extremely poor are further divided into the disabled, elderly, and children, and adults. The disabled, elderly, and children can only be taught and cared for. Adults should be addressed with fundamental solutions, such as relocation to cultivate land or teaching them skills to enable them to earn a living through labor and become self-sufficient. The hidden poor should be identified and assisted through thorough investigations by neighborhood watch groups.</p>
<p>(6) Relief efforts should prioritize proactive and productive initiatives, such as scholarships and small loans.</p>
<p>(7) The most suitable relief workers are impoverished scholars with strong moral character, enthusiasm, and responsibility, who can use their knowledge and experience to develop effective strategies.</p>

<p>— Chun Qiu</p>
<p>I was just conceiving ideas, preparing to write, when a friend of my wife came.</p>
<p>My wife and her friend talked about the insufficient rice for the family and about oil pressing and sugar refining. The friend said with a mixture of envy and lament: "Shanghai's best-paying place must be XX. My neighbor has a son, just twenty years old, who went in for a six-month internship, and now his minimum salary is two thousand yuan, plus housing allowance, rice allowance, coal allowance, and oil allowance. And the work is easy." She added: "I think writing is the hardest work. You rack your brains all day, and even if someone wants it, a thousand words aren't worth two measures of rice."</p>
<p>A person is contradictory. Sometimes, it's "resenting one's own trade," and sometimes it's "being greedy in one's own trade." Writing all day and still unable to make a living inevitably leads to "resenting one's own trade." But sometimes, after writing a piece that one is relatively satisfied with, one cherishes it like a broom, leading to "being greedy in one's own trade."</p>
<p>Recognizing the difference between work and remuneration, not to mention the vast difference between one profession and another, even within the same organization, a reasonable solution is often lacking. As the saying goes, "Hard work doesn't get paid, and paid work isn't hard." This hits the nail on the head. Take political organizations, for example: the lowest-paid and hardest-working positions have always been those of section members. Senior officials, some with very high incomes, spend their efforts on socializing and entertaining.</p>
<p>Take commercial organizations, for example: the lowest-paid and hardest-working positions are those of junior staff. As for general managers, managers, assistant managers, department heads, etc., their salaries are high, and their allowances and bonuses are even greater. Some spend their days idle, simply stamping documents; others take advantage of their positions to engage in speculative business deals.</p>
<p>Comparing various trades, in the past four or five years, some organizations have significantly increased their employees' salaries. The amount of allowances and bonuses is almost unbelievable. Many organizations, however, are terribly underpaid, with salaries plus various allowances not even reaching the tail-end earnings of the errand boys in those "lucrative" organizations. In the same place, working equally hard, sometimes even harder, the difference in remuneration is so great. What could be more unfair in the world!</p>
<p>Based on the above, the salaries within the same organization should break with past practices and be based on the complexity of the work to determine the level of remuneration. As for the various public and private organizations in the same locality, a common standard should be established to provide a reasonable solution for work and remuneration. Only then can this align with the wartime system. Otherwise, the rich will become too rich, and the poor too poor; a few people will enjoy happiness, and the majority will complain, which will severely hinder the implementation of the all-out war effort.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Review of "Flying Prince Attacks Pearl Harbor" <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Chang</p>
<p>The full-length cartoon "Flying Prince Attacks Pearl Harbor" and the documentary "Sky Divine Soldiers" were previewed at the Great China Theater. This reporter received a complimentary ticket, allowing me to see them before others. I have returned and penned this review to introduce them.</p>
<p>"Flying Prince Attacks Pearl Harbor" tells the story of Flying Prince leading a bomber squadron of dogs, monkeys, etc., in a large-scale attack on the enemy fleet. The story is humorous and engaging. The overall structure of the film is largely well-done, but its shortcomings cannot be ignored. While some parts of the story are humorous and laugh-out-loud funny, the whole thing feels a little too dull. The humorous satire is simply organized to convey its propaganda mission through simple images. For example, the enemy's main force is represented everywhere by fat, pig-like American captains. Only in a few scenes do sailors appear (stereotypical, shadow-like sailors). This gives a sense of unreality, as if it were deliberately arranged to allow the audience to vent their anger. Old dramas often used this technique, first depicting the bravery of the barbarian general, and then using a hero from the Central Plains to overwhelm him. "Flying Prince" has the same shortcoming: when Flying Prince attacks, the enemy offers no resistance, their warships remain still in the sea for him to bomb at will, as if he were in an uninhabited land. In this way, Flying Prince's bravery is not shown. These are the areas that I feel are worth discussing.</p>
<p>As for the cartoon techniques in "Flying Prince," I feel that it has the same shortcoming, which is that it is too much like a comic book. For example, when depicting airplanes, I think it should first be a distant view, set against the blue sky, starting as a small black dot that slowly flies closer and closer... This would be more realistic. However, "Flying Prince" almost has no distant views. The airplane always fills the entire screen, which is quite eye-catching. Also, when filming a torpedo, everything else is completely ignored. The water surface has neither clouds nor distant mountains to embellish it, just emptiness and the torpedo. Moreover, the water doesn't look like real water. The play of light and shadow, which is not unusual in American films, is absent here. All that can be seen are many ripples going up and down. The characters are even more crudely drawn. Laughing is just a matter of pulling the corners of the mouth and jiggling them. It's all about rough outlines. Compared to "Pinocchio," it feels like a small witch seeing a great one.</p>
<p>More successful is the documentary "Sky Divine Soldiers." This film describes the steps of parachute training in detail, first telling us about the structure of the parachute, then introducing the actual training of the paratroopers, how to train to avoid dizziness, how to train the jump posture, how to roll when landing, how the speed of each group of six kneeling is uniform... and so on. After the physical examination, we see the paratroopers climbing onto the plane one by one to practice in real life. Then, the film uses fast and slow motion to introduce the real-life practice situation. As a documentary, it is worth watching.</p>
<h3 id="e58">The Various Uses of Aluminum Alloys <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>Currently, most aluminum is used to manufacture aluminum alloys, and the other metals used are carefully selected. Different metals produce aluminum alloys with significantly different hardness and strength. Even using the same metal, the proportion of aluminum in the mix will create distinctly different aluminum alloys. Therefore, in order to meet the different needs of various machines, the manufacture of aluminum alloys is constantly innovating and emerging. Until now, aluminum alloy has become a very important alloy, and the variety of its types is truly astonishing. However, in terms of its manufacturing methods, it can be roughly divided into "cast alloys" and "wrought alloys." This has already become a specialized field of knowledge, but briefly discussing the key points is still worthwhile as general knowledge.</p>
<p>Now, I will give a few examples to describe them separately:</p>
<p>A. Cast Aluminum Alloys</p>
<p>There are many types of cast aluminum alloys, which can usually be divided into three types:</p>
<p>The first type: Aluminum and copper alloys. In this type of alloy, the copper content ranges from 4% to 14%, with 8% being the most common, known as the "No. 12 Alloy." It is often used in the manufacture of automotive parts, such as crankcases, oil tanks, pedals, shields, handles, and brackets. The annual consumption is considerable. Other applications include streetcar carriages and tire molds for making rubber tires. "No. 12 Alloy" has a tensile strength of 19,000 to 23,000 pounds per square inch.</p>
<p>The second type: Aluminum and zinc alloys. Usually, the zinc content ranges from 3% to 35%. The tensile strength varies with the zinc content. Although aluminum-zinc alloys are cheaper, they are less used due to their volume.</p>
<p>The third type: Aluminum-silicon alloys. Aluminum-silicon alloys are a recent discovery. The silicon content is mostly 5% to 15%. In addition to being stronger and lighter than aluminum alloys, and less prone to damage, this alloy has another advantage: it shrinks very little when solidifying. This makes it extremely suitable for casting more complex parts, and the results are much better than using "No. 12 Alloy."</p>
<p>In addition to the three alloys mentioned above, there are many other aluminum alloys made from three, four, or even more metals. Most of these alloys are made to meet a specific need, so I will not give more examples here.</p>
<p>B. Wrought Aluminum Alloys</p>
<p>The solid position that aluminum alloys have achieved in industry today is partly due to Hall's invention of the inexpensive electrolytic aluminum process, and the other part must be attributed to the successful manufacturing of wrought aluminum alloys. This is because wrought aluminum alloys have many advantages, especially in terms of strength. Not only are they higher than cast aluminum alloys, but even the hardest so-called low-carbon steel cannot match them. Therefore, the invention of wrought aluminum alloys can be said to be a great achievement in metallurgy. The first wrought aluminum alloy was "Duralumin," invented by Wilm in 1911. Its main components are copper 3.0% to 4.5%, magnesium 0.4% to 0.5%, manganese 0.4% to 0.7%, with the remainder being aluminum. Due to its high hardness and light weight (only one-third of steel), it is the main material for manufacturing aircraft. Adding 1.25% silicon to Duralumin makes it "Super-duralumin," which is even stronger than Duralumin.</p>
<p>The manufacturing method of wrought aluminum alloys differs from that of cast aluminum alloys in that, in addition to melting and casting, it also requires appropriate temperature changes to gradually age it. After high heat, it is rapidly placed in cold water (the so-called quenching method) to harden it, becoming "Hard Aluminum." Aluminum alloys forged in this way can have their hardness increased more than twice. The tensile strength per square inch is five</p>
<p>This extreme strength and light weight (less than one-third of forged steel) have made it particularly valued by the aviation industry.</p>
<p>During the First World War, the British National Physical Laboratory discovered a new alloy called "Y Alloy." The characteristic of this alloy is that it is very easy to conduct heat, and its strength remains almost the same at high temperatures as it does at low temperatures. Therefore, it is generally used as a material for manufacturing pistons. Its composition is 92.5% aluminum, 4% copper, 2% iron, and 1.5% magnesium. After hardening, Y alloy has a tensile strength of 40,000 to 62,000 pounds per square inch. In recent years, an alloy containing 12% to 4% silicon, 1.0% steel, 1% magnesium, and 1% to 2% nickel has been discovered. In addition to the above properties, it also has the characteristic of low expansion and is about 4% to 5% lighter than Y alloy. It has excellent wear resistance and is even more suitable for manufacturing pistons.</p>
<p>In addition, extremely pure aluminum has extremely high corrosion resistance. Therefore, a very thin layer of pure aluminum is usually applied to the surface of hard aluminum to increase its corrosion resistance, and the added pure aluminum layer can achieve the same strength as hard aluminum. This material is called "Alclad Aluminum Alloy" and is mostly used in the manufacture of the skin of airplanes and airships.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief introduction to the manufacturing and types of aluminum alloys. The actual application variations are far more than this. In short, due to its high strength, light weight, and high corrosion resistance, aluminum alloy has gained a very solid position in industry. Many objects that were previously manufactured using steel are now being manufactured using aluminum alloys. It seems to be soaring and surpassing everything. Someone even said: "Examining the amount of aluminum consumed by a country can determine the inferiority of its military equipment."</p>
<p>This may not be entirely true, but it is undoubtedly true that aluminum will become one of the most important factors in national defense industries. (Proceeds from this article are donated to poverty relief)</p>

<p>— James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>Chips moved from his more spacious quarters with his family in the school to his former bachelor quarters. At first he did not want to be a housemaster again, but the headmaster persuaded him otherwise; later he was happy. This job gave him something to do, filling the emptiness in his heart. He was different: everyone noticed that. Just as marriage had added something to him, so did mourning; after the numbness of sorrow, he suddenly became a different person. The students, in any case, called him "Old" without any doubt. This is not to say that he was less active. He was still able to perform well on the cricket field; nor is it that he had lost any interest or sharpness in his work. Also, in fact, his hair had been gray for many years, but only now did it seem that everyone noticed it. He was fifty years old. During his efforts, he was able to play as well as people half his age. Once, after he had played, he heard a student say, "He's not bad for an old kid like him."</p>
<p>After Chips was over eighty years old, he always chuckled when he thought of this sentence. "Fifty years old is old, isn't it? Er-hem—it was Naylor who said that, and Naylor himself is not far from fifty now! I wonder if he still thinks fifty is such an old age? The last I heard of him, he was a lawyer, and lawyers live long—look at Halsbury, who was a lawyer at eighty-two—er-hem—Chanceher, who died at ninety-nine. That's—er-hem—what age gives you! Too old at fifty! Guys like that are too young at fifty... Myself... just a baby..."</p>
<p>This was true in a sense. Because as the new century began, Chips reached a point of maturity, blending all his unfolding old habits and his oft-repeated old jokes into a simple harmony. In the magazine, he no longer had those minor and occasional troubles, nor did he have any more worries about his work and value. He felt that the honor of Brookfield was reflected in him, giving him sufficient reason for honor in his own person and position (Twenty)</p>

<h3 id="e61">Poverty Relief Association Entrusts Delivery of Winter Clothing to Hidden Poor <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The "Poverty and Illness Relief Association" organized by enthusiastic philanthropists in this city is dedicated to assisting charitable organizations in providing medical treatment, medicine, porridge, clothing, child education, disabled accommodation, and shelters, vocational training centers, plantations, nursing homes, and orphanages. Gradually, it has moved from passive to active relief efforts, handling everything with earnestness. Following a confidential investigation by Yu Sheng from various sources, ten thousand yuan was entrusted to this newspaper for transfer. Yesterday, Venerable Yun Jushi sent 154 clothing vouchers, covering 254 sets for adults and 100 sets for children, entrusting this office to distribute them to the elderly, young, and hidden poor for winter protection. This is truly good news during the winter relief period. (Editor's Note: Providing clothing is currently the only urgent task for rescuing the poor. Our colleagues are extremely willing to serve. If there are hidden poor in urgent need of winter clothing, please request registration from the Social Services Department of this newspaper. After verification, the clothing will be sent.)</p>
<h3 id="e62">School News Roundup <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Tingxian, a senior in the third grade of Wuguang Girls' High School on Gordon Road, unfortunately died of acute appendicitis. To commemorate her diligence in studying, the students donated over three thousand yuan, entrusting this newspaper to designate fifteen free freshmen for the first grade of junior high school starting in the spring semester, using Tingxian's scholarship to pay for it, through the examination of middle school students on the 27th.</p>
<p>Casha Flower, Jiannan Girls' High School, has established five free student places in the second grade of junior high school, entrusting this newspaper to recommend students with excellent grades, waiving all tuition and miscellaneous fees.</p>
<p>Anakin Road Elementary School is setting up a scholarship of 150 yuan this year, limited to cultivating outstanding children from poor families. It will retain ten places each for the fifth and sixth grades, entrusting this newspaper to select students for free admission to the school.</p>
<p>The Yi Yi Voluntary Middle School, established by the Shanghai School Dropout Relief Center, has leased a new school address at 19 Zhenqing Lane, the intersection of Xinza Road and Gordon Road. The school waives tuition and miscellaneous fees. This semester, it will add 60 students to the first grade of junior high school spring class, and 20 transfer students each to the first, second, and third grades of junior high school. Registration locations are at the school's new address and at the Shanghai School Dropout Relief Center at 619, Securities Building, 9 Jiujiang Road.</p>
<p>Zhenli Elementary School on Haining Road, in consideration of the financial burden on students' parents, has set up 50 places with half fees of 25 yuan. In addition, it has also set up Peter's Voluntary Elementary School, which is completely free. Students who cannot afford to buy books can be sponsored and supplied by fellow church members.</p>
