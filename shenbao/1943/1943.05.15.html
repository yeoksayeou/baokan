<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">讀汪主席與奧村先生對談後 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日本每日新聞社社長奧村信太郞先生等一行，爲對國府參戰表示敬意，專程由日來華，晋謁在主席致意，並暢談國府施政以及中日關係問題。（專載今日第三版）每日新聞，爲友邦主要報紙之一，足以代表友邦輿論界，負責者奧村先生，不辭跋涉，光臨我國，僅作官方訪問，而行色忽忽，未暇與中國民衆及輿論界接觸，得將中國人民之意思，傳達與日本人民，溝通兩國民間意志與感情。我們在中國輿論界立塲，對於奧村先生萬里之行，未有機會接受我們這一份禮物——中國民意，實不勝其抱憾！</p>
<p>奧村先生與在主席談話內容，大要三點：（一）中國參戰四個月以來的新動向；（二）日本實施對華新政策後，對於中國民衆心理的影響；（三）在主席所期望於日本國民者。經汪主席一一解釋。奧村先生於傾聽感謝之餘，並表示：「瞭解日本對華政策，在中國各方面有良好影響，尤爲欣慰。希望更努力使中國民衆瞭解日本對華政策的眞意所在。至於汪主席的意旨，自當傳達於日本國民」。</p>
<p>我們對於汪主席解釋的各要點，大體上也是我們所要說的要點。可是，我們根據日常接觸民間意思的觀感，更願就日本對華新政策轉變以後，中國民衆心理的影響以及期待於日本朝野兩點，重加申說，以期日本更進一步運用最切實的措施，而確獲新政策的最高效果。從而獲得中國民衆更瞭解日本對華新政策的眞意所在。</p>
<p>日本對華新政策之中心，是側重於政治經濟方面，目標固甚遠大，執行固甚堅決，這於四個月以來的發展，誠如汪主席所云：「確已給予中國民衆極大的自信與堅固的決心，相信中日合作是可能的，中國復興是可能的。而對於日本政治的和平運動政策之懷疑和悲觀的意識，完全被拭除了」。可是，我們所應特別指出的，有如一列車輛的行駛，在順利前進的過程中，如果尙有多少阻滯行程的障礙物存在，那末，也很足以延誤到達終點的日程，甚至陷車輛於半途而停頓。</p>
<p>自從日本實踐對華新政策後，中國人民心理一般的轉變，這是事實，而轉變的程度未能如預期的深刻，也是事實。那末，爲什麼還未能如預期的深刻呢？這裏，我們竭誠期望日本朝野，在實踐之時，特別注意我國人民的固有性格，重視我國民間的風俗習慣。這一種固有性格和風俗習慣，自有其數千年遺傳的傳統的歷史，雖或不合理，不合時，可是，在我國人民的印象中，仍然是自尊的，神聖的，只能以啓發潛移的功夫，漸致陶冶；而絕不能以强制的方法，急切就範。試舉數例：</p>
<p>（一）我國人向以「打耳光」一事引爲最大侮辱，如果無緣無故而被打，受耳光之一方，認爲最失體面，而將不辭一切，以牙還牙。</p>
<p>（二）我國人對於祖宗墳墓，異常尊重，且涉及風水之說，絕不輕易更動。路過之，必低首默敬，不許踐踏，不許動土，如有人對祖墳草率輕慢，將受鄉黨鄰里之嚴厲指摘，斥爲荒妄。</p>
<p>（三）我國人對於拘捕或受刑，受者固認爲奇恥大辱，銜結於心，而永不可釋。即親友對之，也將輕視。凡盜賊罪犯。固受之應當，如正式工商界市民，應慎重措置。</p>
<p>（四）我國人喜歡他人施以禮貌，與接受他人施以飲食，同其感謝之心。日本原爲重尙禮儀之邦，適應我國人這一習慣，自無困難。</p>
<p>我們可以直認，我國人對於保持性格與風俗習慣，都有頑固成見，如施以相反的刺激，那末，對於被施者的心理成見，雖百般勸誘，甚難使之恢復，更難使之好感。這是中國人心理普遍的通則，盼望友邦人士特別瞭解，這樣，先從日本瞭解中國人民心理而取得中國人民瞭解日本新政策的眞意，才是中日之間，眞正的密切親善。</p>
<p>我們一貫主張，國民政府强化政治地位，實現全面和平，一定從改善民生着手，而爭取重慶統治下的民心，才算成功的上策。同時，我們也主張，日本與中國協力完成大東亞戰爭，澈底肅淸英美侵略勢力，也一定從重視中國人民固有性格與風俗習慣着手，而爭取英美思想麻醉下的中國民心，才算成功的上策。日本實施對華新政策，在華執行的友邦人士，尤其要熟知這一點，因爲言語上的不通，更易引起誤會，而發生相反中國人風俗習慣的措置，感受心理上的刺激。這種可能避免的事實，我們爲中日協力的大前提下，相信友邦人士，必可虛心接納而改善的。</p>
<p>最後，我們很誠摯地告訴站在同甘共苦，一條戰綫上的友邦朝野人士，在和平區內，每一個中國人的心理上，以至態度上，絕對不會對待友邦日本人士不禮貌。因此，在華友邦人士就根本不必懷疑或誤會或顧慮中國人有不禮貌之舉動。所以，我們要求友邦人士深切領會，以同樣的心理和態度對待中國人民，絕對避免刺激中國人固有性格與風俗習慣的措置，那末，新政策實踐的結果，必能獲致最理想的成功。</p>

<h3 id="c2">日新任駐華大使　谷正之昨飛抵首都　中日長官雹往熱烈歡迎　預料中日提携更將邁進 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　日本新任駐華大使谷正之氏，自受命繼前重光大使後任後，即準備來華履新，谷正之大使於十四日下午三時十分乘機安抵首都，偕來隨員爲新任大使館太田參事官及淸水書記官。是日天氣溫和，微有薄雲，由飛機塲至城內沿路樹木，均呈新綠色之夏氣，象徵對大使之歡迎。我政府長官在機塲歡迎者，有褚外交部長，徐文官長，陳內政部長，周外交次長，郭宣傳次長，王內政次長，陳亞洲司長，李首都警察總監，徐交際科長等。日本方面有堀內中村兩公使，日總署松井參謀長，前田落合陸海兩武官，石渡寺岡兩顧問，稻垣南京憲兵隊長，其他滿德義各國大使及日居留民團代表等共約百餘人。谷新大使着常禮服下機後，即與歡迎者寒暄，於貴賓室小憇時，與歡迎者共進香檳後，於下午四時十六分，旋即帶同隨員等分乘特備汽車，駛往大使官邸。沿路中日靑少年向高呼歡迎口號，谷大使抵官邸後，立即召集大使館高級幹部，聆取最近工作報吿，並遣員赴外交部報到，請示覲謁主席日期，下午七時三十分並招待大使館幹部陸海軍武官及軍事經濟顧問等，作初步非正式到任歡宴。</p>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　新任日本駐華大使谷正之氏已於十四日下午三時五十分安抵首都，我國靑少年及全體官民人等均前往熱烈歡迎，谷新任大使爲日本著名外交家，對中國認識甚深，値茲中日雙方於同生共死理念下，齊向大東亞戰爭完遂途徑邁進之際，我人對谷大使能早來華履新，咸表熱烈歡迎，自屬當然。自國府參戰後，日本即發表聲明，尊重中國主權並於國府還都三週年紀念日，復交還在華專管租界，移交管下英美敵產，撤廢長江下流地帶物資移動限制，停止發行軍票，從事一切軍事政治經濟上之實際援助，此皆於重光前任內已完成。茲國府當局亦力謀確立適應戰時體制完備之政治機構，政治力日見開展，此均爲中日國交史上不可磨滅之一頁。日本前任駐華軍光大使爲返國述職，曾於三月杪啓程赴日，國府已特命陳公博爲訪日特派大使，周佛海爲訪滿特派大使，此中措施，亦即國府對善隣友好協力同心增進東亞軸心關係誠意之表示。此次日本政府當局爲更迭新任外相與駐華大使，外相重光氏原爲前任駐華大使，新任谷大使即前任之外相，此在對華外交上自必更趨緊密合作。谷大使此次來華，關於今後撤廢治外法權之實踐，以及其他關係國家交還在華租界之斡旋等具體事項，吾人當寄予無限之期望。</p>
<h3 id="c3">湘省日軍佔孟稽寺　日軍展開夏季攻勢 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>湖南前綫十四日中央社電由長江中游地帶南下之日軍，策應攻陷枝江之日軍，對渝軍之核心陣地，加以猛攻，十四日正午進抵荊州南方約四十公里之大扁湖畔，逼近渝軍之最大要衝某地北方廿公里湖地點，刻正集中猛攻中，某地之陷落，已迫在眉睫。又北上之日軍十三日正午進攻渝軍之重要據點孟稽寺（澧縣東北十三公里）附近地點，經頑抗之渝第四十三第一百十八第百廿一等各師激戰，擊潰渝軍約二千人，十四日晨佔領孟稽寺，刻正繼續北進中。</p>
<p>湖南前綫日軍某基地十四日中央社電　日本華中派遣軍十四日下午四時發表：日軍自五月上旬於洞庭湖畔展開攻勢以來，已擊滅渝軍的四師，繼復於澧縣津市北方地區包圍渝軍五師，目下正展開殲滅戰，國府軍亦參加本次作戰。</p>
<p>南京十四日中央社電</p>
<p>湘省日軍當局，茲定名此次對渝軍第廿九集團軍展開之攻勢與在澧縣及津市北方地區對渝第十集團軍之攻勢爲夏季攻勢</p>
<p>南京十四日中央社電</p>
<p>據湘省日軍前綫十四日消息，湘省日軍展開之夏季攻勢，對佈陣於洞庭湖北岸岳州安鄉枝江間大山岳地帶之渝一第六戰區」「前衛集團軍」，實一莫大打擊。以本月五日對渝「廿九集團軍」之洞庭湖畔殲滅戰爲始，繼於十二日復將渝「第十集團軍」據點澧縣津市北方鄂省兩縣交境地帶之五個師約五萬人完全包圍，而又展開壯烈之殲滅戰，戰機現巳達最高潮。渝方軍當局對「第廿九及第十兩集團軍」曾寄與極大之期待，該兩集團亦自認爲渝方之前衛勁旅，然由於日軍此次之殲滅戰，第廿九集團軍首先潰滅，同時「第十集團軍」亦遭遇末途之悲運，依此觀之，足證渝第六戰區軍及渝方當局之狼狽情况。又此次日軍夏季攻勢予以江南一帶之影響更大，由此可鞏固枝江縣與洞庭湖間之物資交流，縮短渝軍之進攻路綫，强化鄂湘省境穀倉地帶和平地區之治安，以致渝方對此極爲震撼。</p>
<p>日駐華軍　一週戰况　南京十四日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍五月十四日發表一週戰况稱：華北之日軍精銳部隊於太行山作戰中獲得偉大戰果後，復聯合其他新銳部隊，於六日以來在陸軍機之堅密協力下，向蟠踞於太行山脈北部之敵共產軍第十八集團軍展開包圍殲滅戰。此次所謂冀西作戰，於七日晚佔領涉縣府，壓縮包圍網，完全殲滅敵軍，敵陣亡二六〇〇人，鹵獲迫擊砲重機關槍武器彈藥無算，獲得極大之戰果，此次作戰業於十一日終了。又華南之日軍精銳諸部隊爲與華北相呼應，在本月五日展開新作戰，蓋渝第二十九集團軍，最近在所謂渝方抗戰之倉穀地帶洞庭湖北岸地區，有蠢動之企圖，日方遂聯合加以猛烈攻擊，日軍並巧妙利用該地區特有之水路，循此出動部隊舉行奇襲，一舉陷落壋安鄕南縣，渝方所謂精銳無敵之第七十三軍遂行潰滅，九日復奪取所謂渝第六十七軍據點肖家灣，迄十三日止獲得敵方陣亡一三〇〇〇〇人，俘虜二三〇〇人及鹵獲各種大砲十三門之戰果，又日軍之淮擊愈益激烈，已控制渝第九第六兩戰區第一綫之敵據點之死命。又日陸軍航空部隊爲緊密協力地上部隊之作戰，八日大舉猛襲渝第九戰區之據點長沙，十二日十三日復急襲常德德山市炸毀敵軍司令部及重要軍事設施。又在每次作戰中，國府軍隊保安隊及武裝團體協力日軍，隨時隨地包圍殲滅敵軍，發揮至上之武力，充分表現中日提携之實果，反之渝方最近雖宣傳國共統一戰綫之口號，但自各種事實上，完全暗露不統一之現象，故重慶所謂之抗戰體制已近於崩潰之一途。</p>

<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德元首行營今晚宣布：北非戰事終結。公報中力言，軸心軍隊已完成其任務，牽掣敵軍之最精强部隊，以緩和他處戰綫，俾軸心國得獲取時間。希特勒元首與義相墨索里尼曾發電至北非，感謝阿尼姆將軍之軍事成就，並表示感佩其功績，公報原文如下：「德軍及義軍在北非之英勇戰鬥，本日已有光榮之結束，彼在突尼斯四週繼續抗戰，數日來未得飲食之部隊，亦已彈藥竭盡，而不得不停止戰鬥，彼等係屈服於供應之缺乏，而非屈服於敵人之攻擊，敵人亦不得不屢度承認吾人在該處戰塲之軍隊之優越。北非之德。義戰士，實已完全履行其任務，彼等奮勇作戰，抵抗數月，爭取每一寸之土地，牽掣最精强部隊於北非，並使其蒙受人力及物力上之最重大損害，因此他處戰綫之軸心高級指揮部得以緩弛，而獲取時間，此對於軸心之軍事領袖有極大之利益。吾人非洲部隊之英勇作戰，幾達兩年半，以後有機會，將特別作詳盡之討論，此事將永爲德國民族之軍事史中最光榮，最顯赫之一章」。</p>

<h3 id="c11">日情報局第三部長　堀公一廣播演詞　「北非戰與德義之堅陣」 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電</p>
<p>日情報局第三部長堀公一氏，十三日下午七時在此間以「北非戰與德。義之堅陣」爲題，對全國作廣播講演，據稱：今者德。魏軍雖不幸自突尼斯及比塞大兩市撤退，但彼等在突尼西亞從事防衛戰所收之效果，至爲偉大，蓋此次突尼西亞大戰乃予敵方以極大損害。同時德，義兩國得利用從容時間，自法國南部迄地中海沿岸一帶築成堅强防衛綫，其堅固實不决於英。法海峽之防衛。今後突尼西亞之戰事縱有推移，而軸心軍在該處作戰之目的，泰半業已達成，余欲藉此機會一述目前軸心方面在歐洲之地位已如何鞏固，首先自地域方面觀之，德國於前次大戰時，西方僅占領法，比兩國之一部，但此次大戰中，德軍則占領挪威·丹麥·荷蘭·比利時。法蘭西直迄西班牙國境，而確保全大西洋岸，且法。義。希臘各國之地中海沿岸亦巳爲德。義兩國所支配。再就東部方面言，目前軸心軍所佔領之地域，巳較德軍於一九一七年十一月共產黨掌握政權，蘇聯軍力極爲薄弱時所佔領之地區尤爲廣大，且能予以開發利用，此亦與前次大戰時異者。其次再就工業生產觀之，德國已樹第一次及第二次之四年計劃，並正籌謀重要工業資源之自給自足，同時軍需工業亦已妥爲準備，由於西部作戰之結果，法·比·荷之工業生產設備，亦可爲軸心方面所利用，各重要工廠頃正日夜爲軸心國製造軍需品。再自軍需資源方面觀之，目前德國已確保近代戰爭遂行上最必要之鋼鐵·鎳·煤炭及石油之所需紮。再就人力方面言，德國可自其支配之地域及與國補給勞動力。關於食糧方面德國已獲相當自給率，尤以號稱歐洲穀倉之烏克蘭，已爲德軍佔領，因不僅德國一國，即全歐洲之食糧問題，亦均得解決。又此次大戰所使用之飛機，坦克車等新式武器，較前决大戰所使用者顯見優異，尤以德國之潛艇戰術，似已使英。美方面窮其應付，即根據英。美方面之報道，亦力稱德潛艇之保有景爲五百艘至七百艘，而每月可搜造二十艘至三十艘。此外，德宜志於希轉勒元首領導下，軍政各方面已先全離於一致，緊密離結，養國亦於墨索里尼首相統率下，全國民亦均與德國抱同一之理念（爲爭取勝利而戰）。訪次大戰與此次大戰最大不同之點，即爲世界强國之日本，得與同一理念，同一意向之德，義兩國聯合一起，共同起而擊滅英。美，大東亞戰端甫起，英國在太平洋方面配備之艦隊，即殆已全部被擊滅，而目前美國殘存之艦隊大部與英國之艦隊，亦受日本之牽制，被束縛於太平·印度兩洋，並時遭日軍之痛擊，受創至鉅。至於前次大戰時，對英美供給大量兵員之印度與澳洲，於今不僅自顧不暇，無力派兵歐洲，反而極力企求英美火速增援。此外，大東亞地域內之豐富資源，已逐漸由日本從事開發，戰爭牽延愈久，則日本可充分利用南方資源，以增強軸心陣營之戰力，且得强化佔領地之防禦，而必勝不敗之體勢，亦日益强固。</p>

<p>奧村社長：</p>
<p>承主席</p>
<p>親賜接見，得向貴國的參戰表示敬意，並得向主席閣下花甲大慶奉申祝賀，不勝感謝。</p>
<p>汪主席：</p>
<p>遠承過訪，獲得暢談的機會，殊堪欣幸。</p>
<p>奧村：</p>
<p>茲願傾聽參戰四個月後中國的新動向，並國府排除萬難而邁進的現狀。</p>
<p>主席：</p>
<p>當參戰的時候，曾充分考慮以力量微躬的中國的現狀，如何始能有所貢獻於大東亞戰爭。雖然如此，但仍不顧微力而參戰者，最大的理由就是因爲中國在大東亞戰爭中所處的地位，有闡明其立塲與決心的必要。所謂立塲者，重慶現在繼續排日抗日，對此我們所取的立塲正相反對，我們不能不明白我們所取的立塲是東亞的同志的立塲。民衆不以爲和平可以獲致快樂，不以爲和平有保衛東亞義務，參戰的動機，即在於使大家明白這決心與義務。至於說到參戰後四個月的狀况，參戰後立即召開地方長官會議，繼之有全國經濟會議，以及軍事，敎育，司法，行政等全國的會議，這都爲了闡明這立塲，鞏固這決心而召開的。立塲明瞭了，決心鞏固了之後，其次所應該着手的，第一是增强生產，確立治安二大目標。關於生產增强方面，貴國業已與以經濟政策上的援助，那就是日本軍當局把物資移動管理權移交國府，由國府來担任，這給與一般民衆，一般經濟人很大的影響與感動。例如對於上海的經濟人，以前曾努力勸誘其參加和平運動，但未成功，現在趁此機會，都來參加國府的工作了。當組織全國商業統制總會的時候，上海的有力經濟人，幾全部參加，由此可見此舉所與的影響如何。全國商業統制總會自三月十五日成立以來，不過一個多月，所以力量尙不充足，組織運營亦不能說完善。但這些人們都用最大的誠意與國府合作以補其不足，國府與經濟入同心協力，繼續努力。</p>
<p>其次，說到確立治安問題，以强化軍隊爲第一，這須從二方面着手。第一，編制時的精神訓練，即適應新的理想，使能體會，實現我們的立塲與決心的精神訓練。至武裝上的整備，自和平運動開始以來，即已繼續努力，但尙不能說完備，以國府的現狀，欲實行頗爲困難，希能得到日本的援助，同時並實施澈底的精神訓練，以謀地方治安的確立。</p>
<p>奧村：</p>
<p>日本對華新政策的展開，對中國民衆的心理有何影響？如其說對强化國府的政治力有若干效果可舉，即日本國民亦同深慶幸，其實情究竟如何呢？</p>
<p>主席：</p>
<p>日本的新政策確予以很大的影響。其所予對象可分二點來說明：</p>
<p>第一，和平地區的民衆的感想如何？參戰後民衆的確已經活動了。承友邦的好意，而實現了交還租界，撤廢治外法權，撤去國旗的黃色三角布，物資移動管理的移管等，於是民衆有了極大的自信與堅固的決心，相信中日合作是可能的，中國復興是可能的。民衆對於日本的政治和平運動的政策，至少尙抱着懷疑，對前途亦有不少悲觀的觀測。然而在此四個月間，這種意識完全被拭除了。這雖是心理上的問題，或許不現之於形式，唯心理的變化，則爲極大的問題。這不是我的想像，綜合軍人關係，靑年，學生的動向以及敎育方面，商人的動向等各方面向我的報吿而得出的結論。我確信懷疑，失望，悲觀的觀測等已完全消滅，中日合作的決意已經旺盛起來了。</p>
<p>在一面和平，一面戰爭的時候，物資缺乏，民衆生活困苦，誠爲事實。這雖在現實生活的問題上有不安的現象，但或許尙未以異常的熱意現之於形色，幾沒有懷疑與失望的狀况。國府方面，一面感謝日本，一面在國內展開新國民運動，今正艱苦地繼續拚命突破此難關，以獲致光明。民衆也在這裏發見光明了。</p>
<p>第二，重慶方面的精神。這亦可以分二點來觀察，蔣介石·孔祥熙·宋美齡·宋子文等親英美派業已病入膏肓？他們見到德蘇戰的膠着，倚賴英美所宣傳的豐富物資，大東亞戰爭以後，積極參加反軸心陣營，故欲使他們參加和平陣營，頗爲困難。至於一般民衆，則呻吟於重慶政權的壓迫下，他們沒有自由的意志。但是我有二種想法，第一，他們的參加抗戰陣營，因其信念差誤。他們以爲日本想滅亡中國，所以要抗戰。這思想已經根深蒂固，不易剷除。可是其前提在這過去四個月來，因日本的態度，明白了日本並不要滅亡中國。我爲使民衆徹底明瞭這事實，故努力於新國民運動。這運動如能徹底，他們的抗戰基礎就沒有了</p>
<p>關於物質生活，重慶方面，祗在農產地區食糧可稱豐富，但他們也有弱點，沒有食鹽，雖有棉花而機械惡劣，不能製成良好的織物。像這樣的農產原料，却被困於機械，和技術的缺點。他們的宣傳沒有這種事實，可是我們所得到的報吿，可斷言這宣傳是虛僞的。國民政府對此所應做的工作，在於整理稅制，並期待商工業發展。這如其能够成功，重慶方面的農產原料，自然會流入和平地域。說到金融方面，重慶通貨的膨脹，比和平地區何止十倍，雖在實際生活上，金融機構上，加以整理，可是在重慶地區內，祇有一種通貨，不能再維持了。總而言之，如爲了糾正他們的滅亡中國的錯誤觀念而努力，終能完成目的。此外，講求軍事，政治，經濟，文化等各方面的對策，可把民心誘引到和平方面來，要完成這工作，尙須不斷努力。</p>
<p>奧村：</p>
<p>趁此機會，願傾聽汪主席閣下所望於日本國民的言論。</p>
<p>主席：</p>
<p>我想請先生及貴報傳達於貴國國民者無他，還是我從和平運動開始以來所主張的『愛日本，愛中國，愛東亞。』道話是甚麽意思呢？就是想請貴國國民首先愛本國，其决愛鄰邦，再延及於廣泛的大東亞。因此，中日二國國民，第一先須互相理解，根據這主張，我現在正努力使中國國民理解日本。當然這並不是輕而易舉的，可是友邦日本先用明朗的態度，如上所述，着着實行新政策，看到今日的狀况，我很抱樂觀，這並不是困難的事。同時，並對貴國朝野，深致感謝。據此意義，所以對友邦日本國民諸君，亦請充分理解中國。</p>
<p>奧村：拜聽種種懇切言談，深致感謝。我們知道日本對華政策，如主席所述，在中國各方面有良好影響，尤爲欣慰。今後我們希望閣下努力使貴國民衆瞭解日本對華政策的眞意所在。至於閣下的意旨，自當由本報充分傳達於日本國民，大東亞建設的前途，尙甚遙遠，茲願以本報名義，祈求主席閣下繼續指導，繼續奮鬥所倡導的中日同甘共苦，同生共死的信念。</p>
<p>主席：</p>
<p>對奧村先生的激勵，深致衷切的感銘。我們將愈有追隨於先進國日本之後，爲完遂大東亞戰爭而盡微力的覺悟。（翔：譯自五月八日西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>袁主席報吿　主席袁殊報吿云，今日舉行江蘇全省第二屆聯合運動大會，李會長親臨主持，敎育部楊次長參加指導，而友邦聯絡部長亦撥冗蒞止，實深榮幸。溯去年五月首屆聯運，因準備不克，塲地不良，一般成績雖極良好，惟去理想猶遠，希望今日二屆舉行，本兩年來淸鄉工作之效果，體格之鍛鍊，能在大會中充分表現，庶無負於各長官來會參觀指導所懷之期望。務盼參加大會之各運動員心同此意，使本屆大會得有更美滿之收獲。</p>

<h3 id="c30">巡捕槍擊事件 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>昨天下午，共公租界發生巡捕槍傷三人後，畏罪自殺的不幸事件，我們讀了渡總監的聲明以後，略申所見。</p>
<p>本案發生後，警務當局立即明白表示措理辦：</p>
<p>（一）對受傷者，送院醫療，幷賠償費用：（二）直屬長官，應負相當責任，（三）今後盡最大努力，防止巡捕舉措失當。我們對於這種迅速而明朗的措置，深爲欽佩。</p>
<p>我們更同意渡正監表示的：「今後盡最大努力，防止巡捕舉措失當」的一點，我們曾在本月十三日的社評中，提供「改善警政」的意見四點，盼望當局參考。此外，更就今後防止辦法，獻議如次：</p>
<p>（一）警員程度，酌予提高。年老者，應規定退休待遇，准予退休。中年者，予以政治訓練，與精神訓練。考選靑年警員時，提高程度水凖。</p>
<p>（二）警員所佩武器，係備不得已時而出以自衛之用，例如盜匪用槍拒捕時之予以還擊。本案被傷諸人，均係徒手，實無用槍之不得已原因。所以今後巡捕對於使用武器，應極端愼重。</p>
<p>（三）値得重複提出的：警員薪給，必須提高至足以維持一身一家最低生活，以期根本消除作弊動機。</p>

<h3 id="c31">銀行放款的原則 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>政府業經頒布不少法令，取締有投機囤積性的放款，藉以防止信用的膨脹，物價的上騰。維持市面，安定民生，全體金融業，自當恪遵無違。這種措施，不但爲社會公衆的利益，即爲銀錢業本身營業的安全着想，也爲銀錢業經營放款應有的方針。</p>
<p>現在離開了法律，僅就常識而言，銀行放款時應有的考慮，有下列三大原則：</p>
<p>第一，借款人所做事業，是否値得協助提倡？如果是値得的，則雖現在一尚未達到有利之境，而將來的前途，確有希望，對於民生經濟，確有裨益。則銀行確有輔助倡導的義務。否則，銀行對其放款，必將受累無窮。</p>
<p>第二，借款人的道德如何？能力如何？銀行應加以愼重的考慮。若借款人富有道德，辦事幹練，肯負責，能努力，則其現在的事業雖未成功，其信用實已超人一等，銀行對其放款，危險甚少。蓋其信用基於道德，基於能力，便勝過任何擔保。</p>
<p>第三，最不可靠的是暴發戶。銀行的放款，往往僅估借款人現有的身家。常曰「某人現在頗有身家，可以放款」。其實大誤。財主何以新發？何以暴發？必須探本尋源，求其新發暴發的原因。他們不是大半從囤積投機而來的嗎？即使不論其暴發的原因，果否合法，但須明白有暴發必有暴落，銀行放款與彼，何等危險？所以不能以錢估人，而當以質佔人；不能以其爲財主而放款，要檢討其事業，其才品而放款。那末，銀行的放款，於公於私，兩均無失了。</p>

<p>本月三日公佈「囤積主要商品治罪暫行條例」十日公怖「戰時特別刑法」十一日公佈「主要商品登記規則」，於是國府取締囤積之法律上根據，已完全確立，各方均盼當局能澈底運用上項法則，國府業已決定日內再派第二次澈查大員，十三日之各華文報上已正式發表此事，租界各方對於第二次澈查之批評見解，大體如次</p>
<p>（一）一般人民均知各金融機關向與囤積有密切關係，但鑒於首决澈查僅懲處阜通銀行一家，故認爲第二次澈查必須以檢查富有囤積嫌疑之有力銀行爲主、苟有　　　疑查出，須立即予以停業處分，同時採取其他適當懲處辦法。</p>
<p>（二）市政府，工部局，公董局須保持密切聯絡，動員全部警察力量，實行檢查各倉庫與囤貨房屋等。</p>
<p>（三）使民間公正廉潔之士參加澈查團，俾能事先防範對澈查不公平等之輿論發生。</p>
<p>（四）爲安定民心計，須將澈查人員之姓名及檢查方針之大綱，先期發表，使民衆協助此舉。</p>
<p>（五）又鑒於同業公會會員，不將其所持商品登記而匿用他人名義及他種方法囤積者極多，故在澈查同時，應使其開一同業公會全體大會等，俾可促起其澈底之自肅運動，使彼等放槳慣用之觀望態度。</p>
<p>（六）不能僅以威嚇程度之澈查了事，必須長期澈查，擴充經濟警察制度，實現民衆之協助澈查。（雲鵬：譯自五月十四日大陸新報）</p>

<p>— 垂芳</p>
<p>「三千金」是上藝劇團第三期的第一個劇目。從劇本的取選和演員的演技上，我們便可以知道上藝劇團的審眞的熊度。</p>
<p>劇本的梗概是這樣的：民國初年，曾經做過兩廣總督的黎襄尊的膝下有三個女兒，長女潑辣，嫁給性情粗暴的局長韋今虎，次女陰柔，嫁給「書獃子」的莊以誠，三女高傲端淑，待字閨中。那一天，正是黎襄尊的七十六慶，黎翁使把他的全部產業分給三個女兒，但因三女的不善甘言密語，而使他憤怒，驅逐了出去，且把她的一份家產再平分給長次兩個女兒。那知這天以後，利慾薰心的長次二女非但不孝順他，而且厭棄了他，使他在痛苦的絕望下，不顧風雨的吹襲而在曠野裏飄零了兩天，但由於老傭人的幫助，終於到了三女的丈夫章純規的田莊，黎翁眼見了三女的純摯和熱愛，慚愧到了極點，而這時候，荒淫無恥利慾薰心的大女兒，和她粗暴的丈夫及奸刁的姘夫在相互殘殺下死去，留下一羣正直的人，便在晨光曦微中開始了他們的新生活。</p>
<p>二　關於劇本</p>
<p>從這里，我們可以看出作者的目的是在攻擊萬惡源泉的金錢。金錢可以購買某一些人的靈魂，可以使女兒不孝父親，可以使妻子不以丈夫的死爲悲哀。最後，作者的暗示是這樣的：利慾薰心的人終於會在金錢的火炎裏減亡，正直者的情感，是不被金錢支配的情感，也正是人類至珍的純潔的眞情。</p>
<p>爲了達到上述的主題，作者謹愼地處理了適當的主要人物和陪襯的人物。這里，在人物個性的鈎勒上，長次二女的姘夫皮望騰的創造是成功的，他以茶房的出身，而終於在金錢的把戲裏騰達起來。至於對話的寫作，可以說是相當的生活和切要，但是在第二幕和第三幕裏，話題似乎更應側重在金錢的直接折衝卞面，而第一幕裏分家的塲面，人物太經濟了些。此外，第一幕裏三女在未訂婚前直呼男人的名字，似乎也不合高傲的原則。第四慕的黎翁自稱爲「七十多歲」，也不合中國人的習慣，因爲這句話是在他七十壽慶後的一個月左右說的，這時候他顯然還沒有到七十一歲。但是就整個是劇本而說，情節的展開都很自然。</p>
<p>三　導演的藝術</p>
<p>導演方面，正如費穆先生一貫作風：用精巧的小　作和人物的流動性來烘托劇情的發展，來刻劃不同的個性。例如黎翁的手指和嘴巴的顫動，皮望騰的用手帕屢决拂拭流汗的額角。這些都能使觀衆獲得深刻的印象。同時，章今虎的粗暴，三女的高傲，賈昔亭的忠誠，莊以誠的傻氣，也都有各不相同的處理。</p>
<p>但這里我們願意指出若干値得商確的地方，那　是。（一）當父親訓話的時候（這是父女尙末衝突）三女似乎不應面帶愁色，因爲憂鬱和高傲是不能混爲一詩的；（二）雖然在憤怒的時候，七十歲的父親在台　健步如飛，　太誇張：（三）二婿應該是個傻氣的人，但第一幕裏當三女被斥的時候，他屢屢表示正常的安慰態度；（四）第四幕裏的雷雨是非常顯著的，但是一般的演員都顯然失掉下雨的感覺。</p>
<p>四　其他種種</p>
<p>在背景和服飾，燈光和配音方面，都很適當。但是（一）在第二幕裏，作爲局長的衙門辦公室的怖置而僅僅比第一幕多了一張寫字台，未免太欠變化；（二）第三幕裏雷雨時，室內的光亮似乎也應當改變；（三）第四幕裏的大女兒手携這樣時髦的大皮篋子，恐怕在民國初年還不會有的吧。</p>
<p>演昌以皮望騰和黎翁最爲成功，賈昔亭　第一幕裏的一部份對話太輕，三女婿的話（尤其是第一幕）太少音節的變動，大女兒小够潑辣，但，全體演員的都在水準以上。</p>
<p>總之，「三千金」的公演値得全上海觀衆的關心，因爲，這是拜金主義的上海，這是萬惡淵源的上海！雖然在劇本的本身缺乏明確的地方色彩，它不是表現上海的戲，但却顯然和目前的上海有切膚之感。</p>
<h3 id="c43">五大連池遊記（二） <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 加藤美生</p>
<p>漫長的冰凍期過去了，人們的心花也都隨着花圃中爭妍鬥艶的花同時開放了。這時開的花有：五月之前被稱爲迎春花的薄紫色的敦盛草，然後有六月中盛開的菖蒲，蒲公英，在六月中，有鮮紅的紅百合，北滿獨有的黑百合，芍藥，再其次有仙人草，水蓮等，各種鮮艶的色彩，點綴着這荒原的美。自然也似乎喜歡這轉瞬即逝的春天，所以在這季節使各種花兒瘋在地盛開。我們聽到了春天的景色，如今見到了亂離的枯草，也不禁戀戀地想念着。</p>
<p>可是在漫長的凍結期中，地面凍結有一米之厚，池水則竟凍至二米之厚。唯獨這炭酸泉却仍滴溜溜地流動着。隊員們見到這泉水，起了一陣騷動，大家都俯下身去就口而飲。雖然那水是徹骨的冷，但記者的舌上，却感覺不到那冷的　受。所謂五大連池者，是阻塞十四座紀列火山丘的大池，水最深的大的有十二米，從南起稱爲頭池，二池，三池，四池，五池，其中三池五池較大，另外有一條小河，把一個一個池連起來，水流從五池逐流而至頭池。</p>
<p>我們乘着載重車從藥泉山的急斜面駛向三池。　着防寒靴，渡　三池，去看那石龍溶岩。池面結了很厚很硬的冰，像電光般耀目，也似早天的土地般發生龜裂狀態，我們仔細看這冰，大約有二寸厚，是靑磁色的冰塊，極爲晶瑩透澈，可一直見到底。其中有純白而圓的氣泡。在此池中有北滿特有的蝗魚，狗魚，黃花魚，鮒，鯉等，祇要到解凍期，就可見牠們悠問地在池中遊弋。拾起頭來，在冰的那面有臥虎，眞像臥虎般橫躺在那裏。景色之佳，令人嚮然神往。</p>
<p>康德元年左右，據訪問德都的縣公署的人說，有人見到五大連池中有煤層露出，不過拿在手中，好似很粗，點上火就能燃燒。其次，硫化鐵層埋藏的面積也相當廣大。在採訪上是一個難題，但在增產的意義上，却又不捨放與。說到增產，在農業方面，因氣候寒冷的理由，稻在附近不能耕種。這水的溫度尙爲滴宜，朝鮮人都在經營着水田。日本人方面的開拓團，有長野縣黑姬山驚的人們所經營的藥泉山開拓團，在石龍溶岩地帶有木曾的開拓團，均對之頗致期待。</p>
<p>現在北滿的第一勝景五大連池被指定爲國立公園。隊員們一面欣賞勝景，一面興高采烈地談論着。九年之前，尙爲馬占山部下盜匪橫行之地，現在我們所立的溶岩的缺口，正是以前匪賊所視爲天險的要害，而爲我討伐隊的大障碍物。</p>
<p>如今這些盜匪已經完全肅淸了。上面說的國立公園的計劃，把北滿當作保慷地，利用藥泉設立療養所，至於都市計劃，遊覽道路等，也正由當局考慮中。</p>
<p>治安敉平，和平的鄕村，以此地爲中心而擴大開來，人們在花圃追逐悠閒的牛羊，在遊賞中夢見了豐饒的肥土。不，這不是夢，這將是不久實現的樂園，鮮紅的滿洲的太陽，照澈了平原的野草。攝影機開始活躍起來，攝取一切的景物。</p>
<p>隊員們在這靜寂的自然中，似見到了家鄉般，向　夕陽垂下頭來。最後我們又分乘長途汽車與載重車重上歸途。</p>
<p>前人足跡所未到的五大連池，現在與之作別了，我們中間有誰唱起「若向海去」的歌曲，大家都跟着唱和起來。（完）（翔：譯自三月號科學書報）</p>

<p>— 井華</p>
<p>是初夏時節了，馬路上的行人拖着弛緩的足步，顯得有些薰薰然。我踏着人行道上的水門汀，一步的向前走着，眼看着一輛又一輛的汽車，脚踏車，三輪車…很快的從我後面趕上來，又很快的在我前面的人叢中消逝。因了這種對比的情形，使我發覺了我走的速度是多麼的慢。最初我想徒步通過這相當長的路途，而走向我的目的地，現在這計刻有些動搖了。以這樣慢的速率，走着這樣長的路程，眞使我氣餒了。但同時又看到我脚下的路面，一塊塊的向後退着；而且很多在我前面走着的人們，漸漸的落到我的後面去了。這個發現，又使我步行的勇氣，突然增加起來，我立刻確信我一「步步」的走，這路程已一「步步」的縮短，我的目的地也「步步的接近。終於用我的兩隻脚，走到了目的地。當然在時間上，確比那些乘車的差了許多。</p>
<p>企求着成功的人們，也正走着一條遙遠的路，這是一條多荊棘而且多紛岔的路，但請別害怕，讓我們確信，只要養成不畏艱險的勇氣，和堅强的自信力，再努力去獲得充富的經騐來做指示迷津的南針，那麼盡一分的力量，成功之域的距離，便縮短一分；不斷的努力，必然的會達到理想的目的地。這和你用去一元錢，那你存款的總數便少去一元的這會事，具有同樣的必然性，速率的快慢在必要時可別管牠。只要我們不徘徊，不躊躇，不入岐途，矢勤矢勇的一步步的走去，終有達到的一天。</p>

        <h1>1943.05.15</h1>
<h3 id="e1">After Reading Chairman Wang's Dialogue with Mr. Okumura <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shinta Okumura, President of the Japan Mainichi Shimbun, and his delegation came to China specifically from Japan to pay their respects for the National Government's participation in the war. They paid respects to the Chairman to express their regards, and had extensive discussions on the National Government's administration and Sino-Japanese relations. (Specially published on today's third edition). The Mainichi Shimbun is one of the major newspapers of the friendly nation, and can adequately represent the friendly nation's public opinion. Mr. Okumura, as the person in charge, did not hesitate to travel a long distance to visit our country, merely making an official visit, and his journey was hurried, without time to contact the Chinese people and public opinion circles, and to convey the opinions of the Chinese people to the Japanese people, and to communicate the will and feelings between the people of the two countries. Standing in the position of Chinese public opinion, we deeply regret that Mr. Okumura's long journey did not provide us with the opportunity to present him with this gift - Chinese public opinion!</p>
<p>The main points of Mr. Okumura's conversation with the Chairman were three: (1) New trends since China's participation in the war for four months; (2) The impact on the psychology of the Chinese people after Japan implemented its new policy towards China; (3) What the Chairman expects of the Japanese people. Chairman Wang explained them one by one. In addition to listening and expressing gratitude, Mr. Okumura also said: "I am very pleased to understand that Japan's policy towards China has a positive impact in various aspects of China. I hope to work harder to make the Chinese people understand the true meaning of Japan's policy towards China. As for Chairman Wang's wishes, I will definitely convey them to the Japanese people."</p>
<p>In general, the main points of Chairman Wang's explanation are also the main points we want to say. However, based on our daily observations of public opinion, we are more willing to reiterate the impact on the psychology of the Chinese people after the change in Japan's new policy towards China, and what we expect from both the Japanese government and the public, in order to enable Japan to further implement the most practical measures and achieve the highest effectiveness of the new policy, thereby enabling the Chinese people to better understand the true meaning of Japan's new policy towards China.</p>
<p>The core of Japan's new policy towards China is to focus on political and economic aspects. The goal is very ambitious and the implementation is very determined. In the past four months, as Chairman Wang said, "It has indeed given the Chinese people great confidence and firm determination, believing that Sino-Japanese cooperation is possible and that China's revitalization is possible. The suspicion and pessimism towards Japan's political peace movement policy have been completely eliminated." However, what we should particularly point out is that, like a train traveling, if there are still some obstacles hindering the journey in the process of smooth progress, then it is also sufficient to delay the schedule of reaching the destination, and even trap the vehicle halfway.</p>
<p>Since Japan implemented its new policy towards China, the general change in the psychology of the Chinese people is a fact, but it is also a fact that the degree of change has not been as profound as expected. So, why has it not been as profound as expected? Here, we sincerely hope that the Japanese government and the public will pay special attention to the inherent character of our people and value our folk customs when implementing the policy. This inherent character and folk customs have their own thousands of years of inherited traditional history. Although they may be unreasonable or out of date, they are still self-respecting and sacred in the minds of our people, and can only be gradually cultivated through enlightening and subtle efforts; and they must never be forced to comply quickly. Let's take a few examples:</p>
<p>(1) Our people have always regarded "slapping in the face" as the greatest insult. If slapped for no reason, the slapped party believes that they have lost the most face, and will not hesitate to retaliate.</p>
<p>(2) Our people have extraordinary respect for ancestral tombs and are also concerned with geomancy (feng shui), so they never change them lightly. When passing by, they must bow their heads in silent respect, and not allow trampling or digging. If someone is sloppy and disrespectful to ancestral tombs, they will be severely criticized by the villagers and neighbors as being absurd.</p>
<p>(3) Our people believe that being arrested or subjected to punishment is a great shame and humiliation for the person who is subjected to it, and it will never be forgiven. Even relatives and friends will despise them. It is appropriate for thieves and criminals to be subjected to it, but formal business people and citizens should be treated with caution.</p>
<p>(4) Our people like to be treated with courtesy by others, and they are as grateful for receiving courtesy from others as they are for receiving food and drink. Japan was originally a country that valued etiquette, and it should have no difficulty adapting to this habit of our people.</p>
<p>We can frankly admit that our people have stubborn prejudices about maintaining their character and folk customs. If they are given opposing stimuli, then, no matter how much persuasion is given to the psychological prejudices of those who are subjected to them, it is difficult to restore them, and even more difficult to make them feel good. This is a common principle of the general psychology of the Chinese people. We hope that friends from friendly nations will especially understand this, so that Japan first understands the psychology of the Chinese people and obtains the Chinese people's understanding of the true meaning of Japan's new policy. This is the true close friendship between China and Japan.</p>
<p>We have always advocated that the National Government should strengthen its political position and achieve comprehensive peace, starting with improving people's livelihoods, and that winning the hearts of the people under the rule of Chongqing is the best policy for success. At the same time, we also advocate that Japan and China should work together to complete the Greater East Asia War and thoroughly eliminate the invading forces of Britain and the United States, also starting with valuing the inherent character and folk customs of the Chinese people, and winning the hearts of the Chinese people anesthetized by British and American ideas is the best policy for success. Friendly people who implement Japan's new policy towards China in China must especially be familiar with this point, because the lack of communication in language makes it easier to cause misunderstandings and cause measures that contradict the customs of the Chinese people, causing psychological stimulation. We believe that friendly people will be able to humbly accept and improve these avoidable facts under the major premise of Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>Finally, we sincerely tell the friendly government and people who are standing on the same front line, sharing weal and woe, that in the peace zone, every Chinese person's psychology and attitude will never treat friendly Japanese people impolitely. Therefore, friendly people in China do not need to doubt, misunderstand, or worry about any impolite behavior by the Chinese people. Therefore, we ask friendly people to deeply understand and treat the Chinese people with the same psychology and attitude, and absolutely avoid measures that stimulate the inherent character and folk customs of the Chinese people. Then, the results of the implementation of the new policy will surely achieve the most ideal success.</p>

<h3 id="e2">New Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, Arrived in the Capital Yesterday; Warm Welcome from Chinese and Japanese Officials; Sino-Japanese Cooperation Expected to Advance Further <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Tani Masayuki, the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, immediately prepared to come to China to take office after being appointed to succeed former Ambassador Shigemitsu. Ambassador Tani Masayuki arrived safely in the capital by plane at 3:10 PM on the 14th, accompanied by his staff, the newly appointed Counselor of the Embassy, Mr. Ota, and Secretary Mr. Shimizu. The weather was mild that day, with a slight thin cloud cover. The trees along the road from the airfield to the city were all a new green color of summer, symbolizing a welcome to the Ambassador. Government officials who welcomed him at the airfield included Foreign Minister Chu, Chief Secretary Xu, Interior Minister Chen, Vice Foreign Minister Zhou, Vice Propaganda Minister Guo, Vice Interior Minister Wang, Director of the Asian Affairs Department Chen, Police Commissioner of the Capital Li, and Chief of the Protocol Section Xu. On the Japanese side were Ministers Horinouchi and Nakamura, Chief of Staff of the General Agency, Matsui, former military attaches Maeda and Ochiai, Advisors Ishiwatari and Teraoka, Commander of the Nanjing Kempeitai Inagaki, and representatives of other embassies and consulates from Germany and other countries, as well as representatives from the Japanese Residents Association, totaling over a hundred people. After the new Ambassador Tani, wearing formal attire, disembarked from the plane, he immediately exchanged greetings with those who welcomed him. After a short rest in the VIP room, he shared champagne with those who welcomed him. At 4:16 PM, he immediately took his staff and others in specially prepared cars to the Ambassador's residence. Along the way, Chinese and Japanese youth shouted welcoming slogans. After arriving at the residence, Ambassador Tani immediately summoned senior officials of the embassy to listen to recent work reports, and sent staff to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report his arrival and inquire about the date of the audience with the Chairman. At 7:30 PM, he also hosted a preliminary informal welcome banquet for embassy officials, military attaches, and military and economic advisors.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, arrived safely in the capital at 3:50 PM on the 14th. Chinese youth and all officials and civilians went to warmly welcome him. The newly appointed Ambassador Tani is a famous Japanese diplomat and has a deep understanding of China. As Sino-Japanese parties are jointly advancing towards the path of completing the Greater East Asia War with the concept of sharing life and death, it is only natural for us to warmly welcome Ambassador Tani to come to China to take office as soon as possible. After the National Government participated in the war, Japan immediately issued a statement respecting China's sovereignty. On the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, it returned the exclusive concessions in China, handed over the enemy assets of Britain and the United States under its jurisdiction, lifted the restrictions on the movement of materials in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, stopped issuing military currency, and provided practical assistance in all military, political, and economic aspects. All of this was completed during the tenure of former Ambassador Shigemitsu. The National Government authorities are also striving to establish a perfect political mechanism suitable for the wartime system, and political power is developing day by day. These are all indelible pages in the history of Sino-Japanese relations. Former Japanese Ambassador to China, Mitsumasa Shigemitsu, departed for Japan at the end of March to return home for duty. The National Government has specially appointed Chen Gongbo as a special envoy to visit Japan and Zhou Fo Hai as a special envoy to visit Manchukuo. These measures are also an expression of the National Government's sincerity in promoting good-neighborly friendship, cooperation, and the Axis relationship in East Asia. This time, the Japanese government authorities have replaced the new foreign minister and ambassador to China. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu was the former ambassador to China, and the new Ambassador Tani is the former foreign minister. This will inevitably lead to closer cooperation in diplomacy towards China. Ambassador Tani's visit to China this time concerns the practice of abolishing extraterritoriality in the future, as well as other specific matters such as mediating the return of concessions in China by related countries. We should give him unlimited expectations.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Troops Occupy Mengji Temple in Hunan Province; Japanese Army Launches Summer Offensive <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Hunan Front, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army, which moved south from the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, is coordinating with the Japanese army that captured Zhijiang to launch a fierce attack on the core position of the Chongqing army. At noon on the 14th, it reached the shore of Dabian Lake, about 40 kilometers south of Jingzhou, approaching a point 20 kilometers north of a certain important hub of the Chongqing army. It is currently concentrating its fierce attack. The fall of that certain place is imminent. The Japanese army, which moved north, attacked a location near Mengji Temple (13 kilometers northeast of Lixian County), an important stronghold of the Chongqing army, at noon on the 13th. After fierce battles with the stubbornly resisting 43rd, 118th, and 121st Divisions of the Chongqing army, about 2,000 Chongqing troops were defeated. Mengji Temple was occupied on the morning of the 14th, and it is currently continuing to advance north.</p>
<p>A certain base of the Japanese army on the Hunan Front, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Central China Expeditionary Army announced at 4:00 PM on the 14th: Since the Japanese army launched an offensive on the shores of Dongting Lake in early May, it has annihilated four divisions of the Chongqing army. It then surrounded five divisions of the Chongqing army in the area north of Lixian and Jinshi, and is currently launching an annihilation battle. The National Government army is also participating in this operation.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The Japanese army authorities in Hunan Province have now named the offensive against the 29th Army Group of the Chongqing army and the offensive against the 10th Army Group of the Chongqing army in the area north of Lixian and Jinshi as the Summer Offensive.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to news from the Hunan Front of the Japanese army on the 14th, the summer offensive launched by the Japanese army in Hunan Province is a major blow to the "1st and 6th War Zones" and the "Vanguard Army Group" of the Chongqing army deployed in the mountainous area between Yuezhou, Anxiang, and Zhijiang on the north bank of Dongting Lake. Starting with the annihilation battle on the shores of Dongting Lake against the "29th Army Group" of the Chongqing army on the 5th of this month, on the 12th, it completely surrounded about 50,000 troops from five divisions of the "10th Army Group" of the Chongqing army at the junction of the two provinces of Lixian and Jinshi, and then launched a heroic annihilation battle. The war situation has now reached its climax. The Chongqing military authorities had placed great expectations on the "29th and 10th Army Groups." The two groups also considered themselves to be the vanguard elite troops of the Chongqing side. However, due to the annihilation battle by the Japanese army this time, the 29th Army Group was first annihilated, and at the same time, the "10th Army Group" also encountered the tragic fate of the end of the road. From this, it can be proved that the 6th War Zone Army of Chongqing and the Chongqing authorities are in a very embarrassing situation. Moreover, the summer offensive by the Japanese army this time has had a greater impact on the Jiangnan area. This can consolidate the exchange of materials between Zhijiang County and Dongting Lake, shorten the offensive route of the Chongqing army, and strengthen the security of the peace zone in the granary area of Hunan Province, so that Chongqing is extremely shocked by this.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Weekly Battle Situation of the Japanese Army in China; Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Dispatch Army in China announced on May 14th the weekly battle situation, stating that the elite troops of the Japanese army in North China achieved great results in the Taihang Mountain operation, and then joined other new elite troops to launch an encirclement and annihilation battle against the 18th Army Group of the Communist Army entrenched in the northern part of the Taihang Mountains with the close cooperation of the Air Force. In this so-called Jixi Operation, Shexian Prefecture was occupied on the evening of the 7th, the encirclement was compressed, and the enemy army was completely annihilated. The enemy suffered 2,600 casualties, and countless mortars, heavy machine guns, weapons, and ammunition were seized, achieving great results. This operation ended on the 11th. In order to echo North China, the elite units of the Japanese army in South China launched a new operation on the 5th of this month. The 29th Army Group of the Chongqing army recently had an attempt to stir up trouble in the Dongting Lake north bank area, which is the so-called granary area of the Chongqing Resistance War. The Japanese side joined forces to launch a fierce attack. The Japanese army also skillfully used the unique waterways in the area, dispatched troops along them to launch a surprise attack, and captured Dangan Township and Nanxian County in one fell swoop. The 73rd Army, the so-called elite and invincible army of the Chongqing side, was annihilated. On the 9th, the Xiaojiawan stronghold of the 67th Army of the Chongqing side was recaptured. As of the 13th, the enemy suffered 130,000 casualties, 2,300 prisoners, and 13 large cannons of various types were seized. Moreover, the attacks by the Japanese army have become more and more fierce, and they have controlled the lifeline of the enemy strongholds on the front line of the 9th and 6th War Zones of the Chongqing army. In order to closely cooperate with the ground troops, the Japanese Army Air Force launched a large-scale attack on Changsha, a stronghold of the 9th War Zone of the Chongqing army, on the 8th. On the 12th and 13th, it launched a surprise attack on Changde and the city of Demaoshan, destroying the enemy's headquarters and important military facilities. In each battle, the National Government army, security team, and armed groups cooperated with the Japanese army, surrounded and annihilated the enemy at any time and any place, exerted the supreme military force, and fully demonstrated the practical results of Sino-Japanese cooperation. On the contrary, although Chongqing has recently promoted the slogan of the United Front between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, various facts have completely revealed the phenomenon of disunity. Therefore, the so-called resistance system in Chongqing is close to collapse.</p>

<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The German Supreme Headquarters announced tonight: the North African campaign is over. The communiqué emphasized that the Axis forces had completed their mission, tying down the strongest units of the enemy forces to alleviate pressure on other fronts, thereby gaining time for the Axis powers. Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini sent telegrams to North Africa, expressing gratitude for General Arnim's military achievements and admiration for his accomplishments. The original text of the communiqué is as follows: "The heroic battles of the German and Italian forces in North Africa have gloriously concluded today. Those troops who continued to resist around Tunis for several days, having run out of food and ammunition, were forced to cease fighting. They succumbed to a lack of supplies, not to enemy attacks. The enemy was repeatedly compelled to acknowledge the superiority of our troops on that battlefield. The German and Italian soldiers in North Africa have fully fulfilled their mission. They fought bravely for months, contesting every inch of ground, tying down the strongest units in North Africa and inflicting significant casualties and material losses. As a result, the Axis high command on other fronts was able to alleviate pressure and gain time, which is of great benefit to the Axis military leadership. The heroic operations of our African forces, lasting nearly two and a half years, will be discussed in detail on a special occasion in the future. This event will forever be one of the most glorious and illustrious chapters in the military history of the German nation."</p>
<p>Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Telegraph General Arnim to Express Gratitude – Führer Hitler sent a telegram to General Arnim on May 10th, which reads: "I extend my gratitude and highest admiration to you and your valiant troops who fought loyally alongside the Italian forces, defending every inch of land in Africa. The entire German nation shares my admiration for the heroic fighting of the German forces in Tunisia. This battle is of extreme importance to the outcome of the entire war. The final efforts and conduct of your troops serve as a model for the entire German army and will occupy a particularly glorious page in German military history. Hitler." The Italian Prime Minister also sent a telegram to General Arnim on May 11th, stating: "I deeply admire and take pride in the African forces for their firm determination and unwavering courage in resisting enemy forces superior in number. History will especially praise such heroic deeds. I believe that the leaders and soldiers of the African forces have demonstrated the highest courage of the Axis nations. Mussolini."</p>

<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Mr. Koichi Hori, Director of the Third Bureau of the Japanese Information Board, delivered a broadcast address to the nation at 7:00 PM here on the 13th, titled "The North African Battle and the Strong Defense of Germany and Italy." He stated: "Although the German and Italian forces have unfortunately withdrawn from the cities of Tunis and Bizerte, the defensive warfare they engaged in in Tunisia had an immense effect, as the great battle of Tunisia inflicted extreme damage on the enemy. At the same time, Germany and Italy were able to use the time gained to construct a strong defensive line from southern France to the Mediterranean coast, the solidity of which is no less than the defenses of the English Channel. Even if the situation in Tunisia should shift going forward, the objectives of the Axis forces in fighting there have mostly been achieved. I would like to take this opportunity to state how solidified the position of the Axis powers in Europe currently is. First, from a geographic standpoint, Germany only occupied a portion of France and Belgium in the previous Great War, but in this war, German forces have occupied Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium. France, all the way to the Spanish border, is secured for the entire Atlantic coast, and the Mediterranean coasts of France, Italy, and Greece are also under the control of Germany and Italy. Furthermore, regarding the eastern front, the area currently occupied by the Axis forces is even larger than the area occupied by German forces in November 1917 when the Communist Party seized power and Soviet military strength was extremely weak, and can be developed and utilized. This is also different from the previous Great War. Secondly, from the perspective of industrial production, Germany has already implemented the first and second Four-Year Plans and is planning for the self-sufficiency of vital industrial resources. At the same time, the munitions industry has also been properly prepared. As a result of operations in the west, the industrial production facilities of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands can also be utilized by the Axis powers, and important factories are currently manufacturing military supplies for the Axis countries day and night. Furthermore, from the perspective of military resources, Germany has already secured the necessary steel, nickel, coal, and oil needed to wage modern warfare. In terms of manpower, Germany can replenish its labor force from the territories it controls and allied nations. Regarding food supplies, Germany has achieved a considerable degree of self-sufficiency, especially with Ukraine, known as the granary of Europe, having been occupied by German forces. As such, not only Germany's food problem, but the entire European food problem, has been solved. In addition, the new types of weapons used in this war, such as airplanes and tanks, are significantly superior to those used in the previous Great War. In particular, Germany's submarine tactics seem to have exhausted the efforts of the United Kingdom and the United States to respond. Even according to reports from the United Kingdom and the United States, it is claimed that Germany possesses 500 to 700 submarines and can build 20 to 30 submarines each month. Furthermore, under the leadership of Führer Hitler, Germany's military and political affairs have been completely unified, and the nation is tightly united. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Mussolini, the Italian people also share the same ideals as Germany (fighting for victory). The biggest difference between this war and the previous Great War is that Japan, a world power, is united with Germany and Italy, which share the same ideals and the same intentions, to jointly crush the United Kingdom and the United States. As soon as the Great East Asia War began, the British fleet deployed in the Pacific was almost entirely destroyed. The majority of the remaining American fleet and the British fleet are currently being restrained and bound by Japan in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and are frequently subjected to painful blows by the Japanese military, suffering severe damage. As for India and Australia, which supplied a large number of troops to the United Kingdom and the United States during the previous Great War, they are now not only unable to take care of themselves and unable to send troops to Europe, but are instead desperately seeking rapid reinforcements from the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition, the abundant resources in the Great East Asia region are gradually being developed by Japan. The longer the war drags on, the more Japan can fully utilize the resources of the South to increase the combat power of the Axis camp and strengthen the defenses of the occupied territories. As such, the inevitable and undefeated state is becoming increasingly solidified."</p>

<p>Visiting Mr. Shintaro Okumura, president of the Japan Daily News, and Mr. Junji Yamada, managing director, both of the newspaper group based in Tokyo, as an expression of respect for the National Government's participation in the war, and in order to convey the Japanese people's deep appreciation for the hard work of Chairman Wang, leader of the new China, accompanied by Ishikawa, a colleague of the newspaper; Tanisui, the Shanghai branch manager; Miyamori, the Nanjing branch manager; and Murakami, the chief editor of the Bunjusha publishing house, among others, visited Wang's residence at 3:00 PM on the 6th. There, they had an intimate discussion with Chairman Wang, who, though nearing the age of sixty, was still in robust health, covering all matters concerning Sino-Japanese relations during the Great East Asia War, lasting for an hour. In response to President Okumura's questions, Chairman Wang, with a cheerful and amiable demeanor throughout, laid bare his beliefs. Chairman Wang further contrasted the reality of the peaceful areas with that of the areas resisting Japan after the unveiling of Japan's new policy toward China, cited specific examples, clearly explained his countermeasures, and expressed his determination to build peace to his heart's content, which is highly noteworthy.</p>
<p>President Okumura:</p>
<p>I am deeply grateful to Chairman Wang for granting us this meeting, allowing us to express our respect for your country's participation in the war and to offer our congratulations on Your Excellency's sixtieth birthday.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang:</p>
<p>I am delighted that you have come from afar and given us the opportunity to have a frank discussion.</p>
<p>Okumura:</p>
<p>I would like to hear about the new direction of China four months after its participation in the war, as well as the current state of the National Government as it overcomes all difficulties and moves forward.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang:</p>
<p>When we decided to participate in the war, we fully considered how China, with its limited strength, could contribute to the Great East Asia War. Despite this, the biggest reason why we decided to participate in the war despite our limited strength was that China's position in the Great East Asia War made it necessary to clarify its stance and determination. By stance, I mean that Chongqing is currently continuing its anti-Japanese resistance, and we are taking the opposite stance. We must understand that the stance we are taking is the stance of East Asian comrades. The people do not believe that peace can bring happiness, nor do they believe that peace entails the duty to defend East Asia. The motivation for participating in the war lies in making everyone understand this determination and duty. As for the situation four months after participating in the war, we immediately convened a meeting of local officials after participating in the war, followed by a national economic conference, as well as national conferences on military affairs, education, the judiciary, and administration, all convened to clarify this stance and consolidate this determination. After the stance is clear and the determination is consolidated, the first things we should undertake are to enhance production and establish security. Regarding enhancing production, your country has already provided economic policy assistance, namely, the Japanese military authorities have transferred the authority to manage the movement of goods to the National Government, which is now responsible for it. This has had a great impact and moved the general public and economic figures. For example, we used to try to persuade economic figures in Shanghai to participate in the peace movement, but without success. Now, taking advantage of this opportunity, they have all come to participate in the work of the National Government. When the National Commercial Control Association was organized, almost all of Shanghai's influential economic figures participated. From this, we can see the impact of this move. The National Commercial Control Association has only been established for a little over a month since its establishment on March 15th, so its strength is not yet sufficient, and its organization and operation cannot be said to be perfect. However, these people are cooperating with the National Government with the greatest sincerity to make up for its shortcomings. The National Government and economic figures are working together to continue their efforts.</p>
<p>Next, speaking of establishing security, the first thing is to strengthen the military, which must be approached from two aspects. First, mental training during formation, that is, mental training to adapt to new ideals and to be able to understand and realize our stance and determination. As for the preparation of armaments, we have been working continuously since the start of the peace movement, but it cannot yet be said to be complete. Given the current state of the National Government, it is quite difficult to implement. We hope to get Japan's assistance. At the same time, we will implement thorough mental training to seek the establishment of local security.</p>
<p>Okumura:</p>
<p>What impact has the unfolding of Japan's new policy toward China had on the psychology of the Chinese people? If there are some effects that can be cited in strengthening the political power of the National Government, the Japanese people would also be deeply fortunate. What is the actual situation?</p>
<p>Chairman Wang:</p>
<p>Japan's new policy has indeed had a great impact. The objects to which it has been given can be divided into two points to explain:</p>
<p>First, what are the feelings of the people in the peaceful areas? The people have indeed become active after participating in the war. Thanks to the goodwill of friendly nations, the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritoriality, the removal of the yellow triangular cloth from the national flag, and the transfer of the management of the movement of goods have been realized. As a result, the people have gained great confidence and firm determination, believing that Sino-Japanese cooperation is possible and that China's revitalization is possible. At least, the people were still skeptical of Japan's political peace movement policy, and many were pessimistic about the future. However, during these four months, this consciousness has been completely wiped out. Although this is a psychological problem, it may not be apparent in form, but the psychological change is a very significant issue. This is not my imagination but a conclusion drawn from reports to me from all aspects, including military personnel relations, youth, student movements, educational aspects, and merchant movements. I am sure that skepticism, disappointment, and pessimistic views have been completely eliminated, and the determination for Sino-Japanese cooperation has become vigorous.</p>
<p>In a situation of peace on one side and war on the other, the lack of resources and the hardship of the people's lives are indeed facts. Although there may be phenomena of unease in this regard in the problems of real life, they may not be expressed in color with unusual enthusiasm. There is almost no situation of doubt and disappointment. The National Government, while grateful to Japan, is launching a new national movement at home and is now desperately continuing to break through this difficulty to achieve a bright future. The people have also found light here.</p>
<p>Second, the spirit of the Chongqing side. This can also be observed in two points: the pro-British and American factions such as Chiang Kai-shek, H.H. Kung, Soong Mei-ling, and T.V. Soong are already terminally ill. Seeing the stalemate of the German-Soviet war, relying on the rich resources advertised by the United Kingdom and the United States, and actively participating in the anti-Axis camp after the Great East Asia War, it is quite difficult to get them to participate in the peace camp. As for the general public, they are groaning under the oppression of the Chongqing regime. They have no freedom of will. However, I have two thoughts. First, their participation in the resistance camp is due to their erroneous beliefs. They believe that Japan wants to destroy China, so they must resist. This idea has been deeply rooted and is not easy to eradicate. However, the premise is that in the past four months, due to Japan's attitude, it has become clear that Japan does not want to destroy China. I am working on the New National Movement to make the people thoroughly understand this fact. If this movement can be thorough, their foundation for resistance will be gone.</p>
<p>Regarding material life, the Chongqing side can be said to have abundant food only in agricultural areas, but they also have weaknesses: they lack salt, and although they have cotton, their machinery is poor, and they cannot produce good textiles. Such agricultural raw materials, however, are trapped by the shortcomings of machinery and technology. Their propaganda does not include these facts, but the reports we have received can assert that this propaganda is false. The work that the National Government should do in this regard is to reorganize the tax system and expect the development of commerce and industry. If this can be successful, the agricultural raw materials on the Chongqing side will naturally flow into the peaceful areas. Speaking of finance, the inflation of the Chongqing currency is more than ten times that of the peaceful areas. Although it can be reorganized in practical life and financial institutions, there is only one currency in the Chongqing area, and it cannot be maintained anymore. All in all, if we work to correct their mistaken idea of ​​destroying China, we can eventually achieve our goal. In addition, the implementation of countermeasures in military, political, economic, and cultural fields can attract people's hearts to peace. To complete this work, continuous efforts are still required.</p>
<p>Okumura:</p>
<p>Taking this opportunity, I would like to hear what Chairman Wang expects from the Japanese people.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang:</p>
<p>What I would like to ask you and your newspaper to convey to the people of your country is nothing other than what I have been advocating since the beginning of the peace movement: "Love Japan, Love China, and Love East Asia." What does this mean? It is to ask the people of your country to first love their own country, then love their neighbors, and then extend to the broader Great East Asia. Therefore, the people of China and Japan must first understand each other. Based on this proposition, I am now striving to make the Chinese people understand Japan. Of course, this is not easy, but Japan, as a friendly nation, is first adopting a clear attitude, as mentioned above, implementing the new policies steadily, and seeing today's situation, I am optimistic that it is not difficult. At the same time, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the government and people of your country. According to this meaning, I would also like to ask the gentlemen of friendly Japanese nationals to fully understand China.</p>
<p>Okumura:</p>
<p>I am deeply grateful for your various heartfelt words. We know that Japan's policy toward China, as you said, has a good impact on all aspects of China, and we are especially pleased. In the future, we hope that you will strive to make your people understand the true meaning of Japan's policy toward China. As for your intentions, this newspaper will fully convey them to the Japanese people. The future of Great East Asia construction is still very far away. On behalf of this newspaper, I would like to ask you to continue to guide and continue to fight for the belief in sharing weal and woe and sharing life and death between China and Japan, which you have advocated.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang:</p>
<p>I am deeply touched by Mr. Okumura's encouragement. We will become more and more aware of the need to follow Japan, an advanced country, and to devote our limited efforts to the completion of the Great East Asia War. (翔: Translated from the Western Japan Daily News on May 8)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Shooting Incident by Chinese Constable in the Public Concession Yesterday; Three Injured, the Chinese Constable Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment; Superintendent Watanabe Issues Statement Expressing Regret <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department of the Public Concession issued a press release last night stating that a shooting incident occurred in the concession yesterday (the 14th) at 2:10 PM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Course of Events: At 2:00 PM yesterday, Chinese Constable Song Fengming, No. 1764, aged 44, attached to the Hongkew Police Station, was on duty near the Old Rubbish Bridge when he spotted four Chinese men carrying several bundles of cigarettes, acting suspiciously. Suspecting them of trafficking in black market cigarettes, the constable ordered them to accompany him to the Hongkew Police Station for questioning. An argument ensued along the way, and the constable threatened them to comply, but they dared him to shoot. The constable, enraged, drew his service pistol and shot three of them. Two were seriously injured: Zhang Chenpin, a 32-year-old from Zhejiang, was shot in the abdomen, and Qian Debao, a 34-year-old from Shanghai, was shot in the left shoulder, the bullet not exiting. Rong Changnian, a 34-year-old from Shanghai, sustained a minor wound to the buttocks. At this point, Constable No. 1764 realized he had committed a serious violation of police regulations. He then fired the pistol at his temple, falling to the ground and dying instantly. The three injured men were transported to Baolong Hospital for treatment and are not in life-threatening condition. The constable had served in the Police Department for over 17 years and had a good record, making this unfortunate incident all the more inexplicable.</p>
<p>Superintendent's Statement: After the incident, Police Superintendent Masami Watanabe issued a statement, saying: Yesterday, a Chinese constable of the Public Concession Police Department, while on duty, saw four Chinese men acting suspiciously and ordered them to accompany him to the police station for questioning. On the way, a fierce argument broke out, and the constable, in a moment of anger, shot three of them. The constable then shot himself. As the superintendent, I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. The three injured men are currently receiving medical treatment and will receive appropriate compensation in the future. His direct superiors will bear considerable responsibility. I will strive to remove police constables who are prone to excessive stimulation when faced with difficult situations to prevent such incidents from happening again.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Arsonist Chen Jinshan Convicted Yesterday; Sentenced to Life Imprisonment <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>At 12:45 AM on the 19th of last month, a fire suddenly broke out at the Chen Taichang carriage company at 124 Guizhou Road, resulting in the deaths of twenty men and women and injuring twelve others. After investigation by Chinese detectives Tao Gengen and Xu Fusheng of the Old Zha Police Station, it was learned that Chen Jinshan, the nephew of Chen Haiyuan, the owner of the carriage company, had a grudge against his uncle and set the fire to vent his anger. Unexpectedly, this led to a major disaster. The detectives managed to apprehend Chen Jinshan, who was handed over to the Special First Court. A verdict was reached the other day, and the court announced its judgment yesterday: Chen Jinshan is sentenced to life imprisonment for arson causing the destruction of a residence currently in use, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The accompanying civil lawsuit is transferred to the Civil Court for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Full Assistance from Japanese Side for the Trade Control Association; Central China Consular Meeting Held <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>As the lower-level organizations of the National General Commerce Control Association are becoming increasingly complete, the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, in order to ensure full cooperation from Japanese agencies in various regions with the Trade Control Association, held a Central China Consular Meeting at the office on the 14th and 15th. Yesterday was the first day. From the embassy, Minister Tajiri, Economic Department Director Okuda, and section chiefs attended. From various consulates general and consulates, Consul General Yano (Shanghai), Consul Men-dong (Nanjing), Consul Nakane (Bengbu), Consul Tanaka (Hangzhou), Consul Kosakabe (Suzhou), Consul Ogawa (Xuzhou), Consul Lin-shang (Haizhou), and Acting Consul Shioka (Wuhu) attended. In the morning, Minister Tajiri delivered instructions, followed by speeches by Economic Department Director Okuda and Commerce and Industry Section Chief Tokunaga. In the afternoon, there were mutual discussions on various issues related to the National General Commerce Control Association, with speeches by various department and section chiefs, adjourning at 6 PM. On the morning of the second day, consuls will report on local conditions, and in the afternoon, Minister Tajiri will host a banquet.</p>
<p>At the first day's meeting, Economic Department Director Okuda of the embassy elaborated on the operation of the Trade Control Association as follows: Due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the influence of Britain and the United States in China has been completely eliminated by the Japanese army, and a genuine Sino-Japanese partnership has been established. Under these circumstances, Japan's policy towards China has seen a major turning point. Coordinating with political measures such as the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions, China's economic policies are also being promoted towards autonomous responsibility as much as possible. The establishment of the National General Commerce Control Association on March 15th has profound significance. The specific business of the association, in addition to handling the past permit affairs for the movement of goods in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, will also implement control over the movement of goods in Central China, Mengjiang, and South China from May 15th. Once the lower-level organizations currently under preparation are completed, it will actively handle the purchase and distribution of major materials. Therefore, the position of the National General Commerce Control Association is extremely important, and its smooth operation has a significant contribution to the strengthening of the National Government. It is hoped that you will contribute to the organization of the lower-level organizations of the Trade Control Association in various regions and cooperate with their operation.</p>

<p>Food Bureau to Stop Fraudulent Collection of Rations</p>

In order to strictly rectify this, the bureau has decided to adopt large-scale household registration checks to stop the fraudulent collection of rations and to facilitate the overall promotion of food administration.</p>

<p>Minister's Speech: Propaganda Minister Lin gave a speech at the inauguration ceremony of the China Film Company, expressing three points: First, the film industry is closely related to social education and cultural propaganda. Its mission is to guide the improvement of national life, which is incomparable to the British and American style, which is only for entertainment and profit. Second, in the Greater East Asia War, the film industry, as a department of the cultural industry, must meet wartime needs, make it a force in the total war, and closely cooperate with the film industries of friendly countries such as Japan and Manchukuo to establish a base for the film culture of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Third, the overall planning of the film industry is to ensure the reasonable profit of private capital on the one hand, and to combine the power of the government and the people in accordance with national policy to seek the sound development of the film industry. Based on the above reasons, after the establishment of the China Film United Company, the government will fulfill its responsibilities of supervision and support, and the employees should also make efforts to promote cultural improvement. It is hoped that all sectors of society will jointly supervise, urge, and sincerely assist, so that the mission of the film industry can be completed.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the distribution of discount cigarettes, the Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association has been making every effort to devise countermeasures to completely eliminate the black market for cigarettes. Recently, the association noted that some citizens, in order to buy more of these limited-price cigarettes, often send children to buy them. This violates the principle of discount sales, and order is not easily maintained. Therefore, it is stipulated that from today, children are not allowed to buy discount cigarettes.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Police Shooting Incident <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, an unfortunate incident occurred in the Public Concession in which a police officer shot and injured three people before committing suicide out of fear of punishment. After reading Inspector Watanabe's statement, we would like to express our views briefly.</p>
<p>After the incident occurred, the police authorities immediately clearly stated the handling measures:</p>
<p>(1) The injured will be sent to the hospital for medical treatment and compensation for expenses; (2) The immediate superior officer should bear considerable responsibility; (3) Make the greatest efforts in the future to prevent improper actions by the police. We deeply admire this rapid and clear measure.</p>
<p>We further agree with Inspector Watanabe's statement that "the greatest efforts will be made in the future to prevent improper actions by the police." We provided four points of "improving the police administration" in the editorial on the 13th of this month, and hope that the authorities will refer to them. In addition, the following suggestions are offered on how to prevent such incidents in the future:</p>
<p>(1) The level of police officers should be appropriately improved. Elderly officers should be given retirement benefits and allowed to retire. Middle-aged officers should be given political training and spiritual training. When selecting young police officers, raise the level of education.</p>
<p>(2) The weapons worn by police officers are for self-defense in case of necessity, such as resisting a bandit's arrest with a gun. The people injured in this case were all unarmed, and there was no compelling reason to use a gun. Therefore, police officers should be extremely cautious when using weapons in the future.</p>
<p>(3) It is worth repeating that police officers' salaries must be raised to be sufficient to maintain the minimum living standards of themselves and their families in order to fundamentally eliminate the motivation for cheating.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e32">Principles of Bank Lending <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The government has promulgated many laws and regulations to ban loans with speculative hoarding characteristics, in order to prevent the expansion of credit and the rise in prices. Maintaining the market and stabilizing people's livelihoods is something that the entire financial industry should abide by without violating. This measure is not only for the benefit of the public, but also for the safety of the business of the silver industry itself, and it is the direction that the silver industry should have in managing loans.</p>
<p>Now, leaving aside the law and speaking only from common sense, the following three major principles should be considered when banks make loans:</p>
<p>First, is the cause of the borrower worth assisting and promoting? If it is worth it, then although it has not yet reached a profitable situation, the future prospects are indeed promising, and it is indeed beneficial to the people's livelihood and economy. Then the bank has the obligation to assist in advocating. Otherwise, the bank's lending to it will be endlessly implicated.</p>
<p>Second, what is the borrower's morality? What is his ability? The bank should consider it carefully. If the borrower is moral, capable of handling affairs, willing to take responsibility, and able to work hard, then although his current career is not successful, his credit has surpassed others, and the bank's lending to him is of little danger. Because his credit is based on morality, based on ability, it is better than any guarantee.</p>
<p>Third, the most unreliable are the parvenus. Bank loans often only estimate the borrower's current wealth. They often say, "Someone is quite wealthy now, and a loan can be made." In fact, it is a big mistake. Why is the rich man newly rich? Why does he suddenly become rich? We must explore the roots and seek the reasons for his new wealth and sudden wealth. Aren't they mostly from hoarding and speculation? Even if we don't talk about the reasons for their sudden wealth, whether it is legal or not, we must understand that there must be a fall if there is a sudden rise. How dangerous is the bank's lending to them? Therefore, we cannot estimate people with money, but we should occupy people with quality; we cannot make loans because they are rich, but we should review their career and their talents before making loans. Then, the bank's lending will not lose out to the public or private.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Trade Control Association Stipulates Control of Important Materials Shipped to North and South China; Total of 25 Types to Be Implemented Starting Today <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Since the National General Commerce Control Association has implemented full control over the economy of Central China, it is indeed necessary to establish a supply and demand plan for important materials within Central China. In addition, from the current stage of currency policy, control must be imposed on the transportation of important materials to other regions. In order to adapt to the above situation, with the permission of the government authorities, the interim measures for the movement permits of important materials from Central China to North China, Mengjiang, South China (Guangdong Shantou Xiamen) and the Hankou area (Hankou Nanchang Jiujiang) have been temporarily formulated, and have been negotiated with customs and transportation agencies.

In addition, this measure is temporary. Once the purchase and distribution agencies in each region are completed, the currency policy is advanced, and there is no need for control in fact, it will be abolished successively. The types of important materials moved out and the interim measures for stipulating control are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Types of Important Materials Moved Out Regarding the movement of important materials from three provinces and two cities to other regions, the Material Control Review Committee and the Executive Committee have formulated control implementation measures.

For the above 25 types of controlled products, it is necessary to have a permit issued by the local government of the area of import (Japanese merchants from the consulate or troops) to apply to the Trade Control Association for removal. The customs and other transportation agencies will not accept it without the removal permit from the Trade Control Association. As for materials other than the above 25 types, only an import permit is required, and no export permit is required.</p>

Those who fail to complete the registration procedures with the association within the time limit will be dealt with in accordance with government laws and regulations. The cotton yarn and cotton cloth will not be allowed to enjoy the right of free sale and movement in the future, and the association will send personnel to check at any time.

<h3 id="e39">Trend of Chinese Stocks <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, most Chinese stocks were still sluggish, due to various news and the decline in goods prices, investors were temporarily in a wait-and-see mood. The tightening of credit was also one of the reasons for the oversupply. However, the new pharmaceutical industry was particularly favored. The Franco-Chinese Pharmacy had a large transaction volume and appeal, and after falling, it quickly returned to its previous level. The decline in the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory was also small. In the department store industry, the National Goods and Wing On stores had active transactions, and Sincere was stable. In the textile industry, the Wing On Silk Factory sold more actively but fell slightly, and the Mayer Silk Factory also declined slightly. In the utility industry, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company again made a small move, and only the China General Edison saw an increase. In the cultural industry, the World Book Co. saw many buyers when prices were low, and the China Book Company was flat. The Commercial Press rose slightly, and transaction volumes were small. The Great China Match Company and the Nanyang Silk Company were stable. The Jiu An Industrial and the New Benefit Real Estate companies were both small. Other stocks were generally weak.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Various Opinions on the Second Thorough Investigation <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing the Hoarding of Major Commodities" were promulgated. On the 10th, the "Wartime Special Criminal Law" was promulgated. On the 11th, the "Registration Rules for Major Commodities" were promulgated. Thus, the legal basis for the National Government to crack down on hoarding has been fully established. All parties hope that the authorities can thoroughly apply the above rules. The National Government has already decided to send a second group of investigators in the coming days. This matter was formally announced in the Chinese newspapers on the 13th. The criticisms and opinions of all parties in the concessions regarding the second thorough investigation are generally as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The general public is aware that financial institutions have a close relationship with hoarding, but in view of the fact that the first investigation only punished Futong Bank, it is believed that the second investigation must focus on inspecting powerful banks suspected of hoarding. If any suspicion is found, they should be immediately suspended from business and other appropriate penalties should be taken.</p>
<p>(2) The Municipal Government, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Public Works Department should maintain close contact and mobilize all police forces to carry out inspections of various warehouses and hoarding houses.</p>
<p>(3) Fair and honest people from the private sector should participate in the investigation team so that unfair public opinion on the investigation can be prevented in advance.</p>
<p>(4) In order to stabilize public sentiment, the names of the investigators and the general outline of the inspection policy should be announced in advance so that the public can assist in this effort.</p>
<p>(5) Furthermore, in view of the fact that many members of industry associations do not register their goods and hoard them under other people's names and other methods, a general meeting of the entire industry association should be held at the same time as the investigation to promote a thorough self-discipline movement and make them abandon their habitual wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>(6) The investigation cannot be merely a threatening event. It must be a long-term investigation, the economic police system must be expanded, and public assistance in the investigation must be realized. (Yunpeng: Translated from the May 14th Continental New Report)</p>

<p>— Louis B.</p>
<p>"Ah! What a suffocating environment, what a monotonous life! ... It's so meaningless!"</p>
<p>Many friends lament in this way.</p>
<p>Once, in a conversation among friends, I heard one of them groaning in frustration again:</p>
<p>"Ah! What a suffocating environment; what a monotonous life! ... When will I be able to leave this boring environment?"</p>
<p>This time I couldn't help but ask him the question:</p>
<p>"Eh! You hate this environment, so what are you doing?"</p>
<p>"My ideal ... a ... In short, I always feel dissatisfied and bored with the current environment," he said vaguely.</p>
<p>Indeed, everyone hopes to find "satisfaction" and "interest" in life, but in fact, most people fail to understand how to actively seek them out; instead, they passively wait and blindly become weary. Some neglect everything around them that is familiar, thinking it is ordinary and meaningless; others lack courage and energy, and are too lazy to observe and explore things outside, so all the opportunities that could satisfy them and arouse their interest are wasted and slip away around them! Even if someone has a warm heart, the result is still emptiness leading to boredom and annoyance.</p>
<p>Life is a fertile field, not a magnificent palace. It does not give people ready-made enjoyment; one must diligently cultivate it. Every friend who hopes to live a healthy life! When you resolutely decide to start cultivating "life," you must use the three powerful tools—detailed observation, skillful adaptation, and courageous exploration. Only then can you, no matter what the environment, no matter what the life, produce, refine, and absorb your own nourishment.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Review of "Three Daughters" <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Chuifang</p>
<p>"Three Daughters" is the first play of the third term of the Shanghai Art Troupe. From the selection of the script and the acting skills of the actors, we can see the discerning attitude of the Shanghai Art Troupe.</p>
<p>The outline of the play is as follows: In the early years of the Republic of China, Li Xiangzun, who had once served as the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, had three daughters. The eldest daughter was pungent and married Wei Jinhu, a rough-tempered bureau chief. The second daughter was gentle and married Zhuang Yicheng, a "bookworm." The third daughter was proud, dignified, and unmarried. On the day of Li Xiangzun's seventy-sixth birthday, the old man divided all of his property among his three daughters, but because the third daughter was not good at flattering words, he became angry and drove her out, and divided her share of the property equally between the eldest and second daughters. However, after that day, the eldest and second daughters, who were blinded by greed, not only were not filial to him, but also disliked him, causing him to wander in the wilderness for two days in the painful despair, regardless of the wind and rain. But with the help of an old servant, he finally arrived at the farm of Zhang ChunGui, the third daughter's husband. Li Xiangzun saw the third daughter's purity and love, and felt extremely ashamed. At this time, the licentious, shameless, and greedy eldest daughter, her violent husband, and her cunning lover died in mutual killings, leaving a group of upright people, who began their new life in the faint dawn.</p>
<p>2.  About the Script</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the author's purpose is to attack the root of all evil, money. Money can buy the souls of some people, can make daughters unfilial to their fathers, and can make wives not grieve over their husbands' deaths. Finally, the author's implication is this: those who are blinded by greed will eventually perish in the flames of money, while the emotions of the upright are not controlled by money, and are precisely the most precious pure and true feelings of mankind.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the above theme, the author carefully handled the appropriate main characters and supporting characters. Here, in the outlining of the characters' personalities, the creation of Pi Wangteng, the lover of the eldest and second daughters, is successful. He rose from the position of a tea waiter and finally prospered in the game of money. As for the writing of dialogue, it can be said to be quite vivid and essential, but in the second and third acts, the topic should seem to focus more on the direct conflict over money, while in the first act, the scene of dividing the family property is too economical in terms of characters. In addition, in the first act, the third daughter calling a man by his name before she is engaged does not seem to be in line with the principle of pride. Li Weng referring to himself as "over seventy years old" in the fourth act is also inconsistent with Chinese customs, because this sentence is said about a month or so after his seventieth birthday, and at this time he has obviously not yet reached seventy-one years old. But as a whole, the development of the plot is very natural.</p>
<p>3.  The Art of Directing</p>
<p>In terms of directing, as in Mr. Fei Mu's consistent style: using ingenious small gestures and the fluidity of characters to highlight the development of the plot and to portray different personalities. For example, Li Weng's trembling fingers and mouth, Pi Wangteng's repeated wiping of his sweaty forehead with a handkerchief. These can give the audience a deep impression. At the same time, Zhang Jinhu's rudeness, the third daughter's pride, Jia Xiting's loyalty, and Zhuang Yicheng's foolishness are all handled differently.</p>
<p>But here we would like to point out some things that are worth discussing. (1) When the father is giving a lecture (this is before the conflict between father and daughter), the third daughter should not seem to have a sad look on her face, because melancholy and pride cannot be mixed into one; (2) Although in anger, the seventy-year-old father strides across the stage, it is too exaggerated; (3) The second son-in-law should be a foolish person, but in the first act, when the third daughter is rebuked, he repeatedly expresses a normal attitude of comfort; (4) The thunderstorm in the fourth act is very obvious, but the general actors obviously lose the feeling of rain.</p>
<p>4.  Other Things</p>
<p>In terms of background and costumes, lighting and sound effects, they are all appropriate. But (1) in the second act, the layout of the bureau chief's office is only one more desk than the first act, which is too lacking in change; (2) in the third act, the indoor lighting should also be changed during the thunderstorm; (3) in the fourth act, the eldest daughter carrying such a fashionable large leather suitcase is unlikely to have existed in the early years of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The actors playing Pi Wangteng and Li Weng are the most successful, Jia Xiting's part of the dialogue in the first act is too light, the third son-in-law's words (especially in the first act) have too few changes in tone, the eldest daughter is not pungent enough, but all the actors are above average.</p>
<p>In short, the performance of "Three Daughters" deserves the attention of all audiences in Shanghai, because this is Shanghai of money worship, this is Shanghai of the source of all evil! Although the script itself lacks a clear local color, it is not a play that expresses Shanghai, but it obviously has a visceral feeling with the current Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Travels to Wudalianchi (2) <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Kato Mio</p>
<p>The long freezing period has passed, and people's hearts have blossomed along with the flowers competing for beauty in the flower beds. The flowers that bloom at this time include: the light purple "Atsumori" grass, called "Spring Welcoming Flower" before May, then there are irises and dandelions that bloom in mid-June. In mid-June, there are bright red red lilies, black lilies unique to northern Manchuria, peonies, and then there are clematis, water lilies, etc. Various bright colors embellish the beauty of this wilderness. Nature also seems to like this fleeting spring, so in this season it makes various flowers bloom madly on the ground. We have heard of the scenery of spring, and now when we see the chaotic withered grass, we cannot help but miss it with lingering thoughts.</p>
<p>However, during the long freezing period, the ground freezes to a thickness of one meter, and the pond water actually freezes to a thickness of two meters. Only this carbonic acid spring still flows smoothly. The team members saw the spring water and caused a commotion. Everyone bent down and drank from it. Although the water was bone-chillingly cold, the reporter's tongue could not feel the cold. The so-called Wudalianchi are large ponds that block fourteen volcanic hills. The deepest and largest ponds are twelve meters deep. Starting from the south, they are called the First Pond, Second Pond, Third Pond, Fourth Pond, and Fifth Pond. Among them, the Third Pond and the Fifth Pond are larger. In addition, there is a small river that connects the ponds one by one. The water flows from the Fifth Pond to the First Pond.</p>
<p>We drove a heavy truck from the steep slope of Yaquan Mountain towards the Third Pond. Wearing cold-proof boots, we crossed the Third Pond to see the Stone Dragon Lava. The surface of the pond was covered with thick, hard ice that was as dazzling as electric light and cracked like early-morning soil. We looked closely at the ice, which was about two inches thick and was a celadon-colored ice block that was extremely crystal clear and could be seen all the way to the bottom. Among them were pure white and round bubbles. In this pond, there are fish unique to northern Manchuria, such as pike, dogfish, yellow croaker, crucian carp, and carp. As long as the ice melts, you can see them leisurely swimming in the pond. Looking up, on the other side of the ice was a crouching tiger, lying horizontally like a crouching tiger. The scenery was so beautiful that people yearned for it.</p>
<p>Around the first year of the Kangde era, according to people who visited the DeDu County Office, someone saw coal seams exposed in Wudalianchi. However, it seemed very rough in the hand and could burn when lit. Secondly, the area where iron sulfide layers are buried is also quite large. It is a difficult problem in terms of mining, but in terms of increasing production, it is reluctant to give up. Speaking of increasing production, in terms of agriculture, rice cannot be cultivated nearby due to the cold climate. The temperature of the water is still suitable, and Koreans are managing paddy fields. The Japanese development teams, including the Yaquan Mountain development team from Kurohime Mountain in Nagano Prefecture and the Kiso development team in the Stone Dragon Lava area, have high expectations for it.</p>
<p>Now, Wudalianchi, the first scenic spot in northern Manchuria, has been designated as a national park. The team members admired the scenery and talked happily. Nine years ago, it was still a place where bandits under Ma Zhanshan roamed. The gap in the lava where we are now standing was precisely the key point that the bandits regarded as a natural barrier and was a major obstacle for our punitive expedition.</p>
<p>Now these bandits have been completely suppressed. The above-mentioned national park plan treats northern Manchuria as a protected area and uses Yaquan to establish sanatoriums. As for urban planning, tourist roads, etc., they are also being considered by the authorities.</p>
<p>Security has been restored, and a peaceful village has expanded with this place as the center. People chase leisurely cattle and sheep in the flower beds and dream of fertile soil during their sightseeing. No, this is not a dream. This will be a paradise that will soon be realized. The bright red sun of Manchuria shines through the weeds on the plains. The camera began to be active, capturing all the scenery.</p>
<p>In this quiet nature, the team members seemed to see their hometown, and they bowed their heads towards the setting sun. Finally, we took the long-distance bus and heavy truck again to return.</p>
<p>We said goodbye to Wudalianchi, a place that no predecessors had ever set foot on. One of us started singing the song "If You Go to the Sea," and everyone followed along. (The End) (Xiang: Translated from the March issue of Scientific Journal)</p>
<h3 id="e45">From Walking to the Road to Success <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Jinghua</p>
<p>It is early summer, and the pedestrians on the road are dragging their slow steps, appearing somewhat drowsy. I stepped on the cement on the sidewalk, walking forward step by step, watching cars, bicycles, tricycles... quickly catch up from behind me, and then quickly disappear into the crowd in front of me. This contrast made me realize how slow my walking speed was. Initially, I wanted to walk this rather long journey to my destination, but now this plan is somewhat shaken. Walking such a long distance at such a slow pace really discourages me. But at the same time, I saw the pavement under my feet receding backward piece by piece; and many people walking in front of me gradually fell behind me. This discovery suddenly increased my courage to walk, and I immediately believed that as I walked "step by step," the journey was shortening "step by step," and my destination was approaching "step by step." Finally, I reached my destination with my two feet. Of course, in terms of time, it was indeed much worse than those who took a vehicle.</p>
<p>People who aspire to success are also walking a long road, a road full of thorns and many forks, but please don't be afraid, let us be sure that as long as we cultivate the courage to not fear difficulties and the strong self-confidence, and then work hard to obtain abundant experience to be the needle pointing out the maze, then as we devote one point of strength, the distance to the realm of success will be shortened by one point; continuous efforts will inevitably reach the ideal destination. This has the same inevitability as the fact that if you spend one yuan, then the total amount of your savings will decrease by one yuan. Don't worry about the speed at any time, as long as we do not hesitate, do not waver, do not enter a wrong path, and walk step by step with diligence and courage, there will eventually be a day of reaching it.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Shanghai Hemorrhoid Treatment Center Issues Preferential Treatment Coupons <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Liming, Director of the Shanghai Hemorrhoid Treatment Center, wrote: "Since the establishment of this center, it has been loved by all walks of life, and patients with hemorrhoids have been enthusiastically introduced to this center for treatment, requesting preferential treatment. In this era of expensive medicines, it is quite difficult to cope with, and I am very sorry. As a medical duty, the way to help the world is a matter of duty, but my personal ability is limited, and I cannot do as much as I want. Therefore, this time, starting from May 23rd, I will start a trial to issue 100,000 yuan of preferential treatment coupons, which will be sent to the Shanghai Newspaper News Social Service Office. Those who are indeed poor teachers and staff in the education sector who suffer from hemorrhoids, anal fistulas, etc., and hope to be treated at this center, will be limited to one preferential treatment coupon of 500 yuan or 300 yuan per person, which will be given to offset the cost of medical treatment and surgery, to express our sincere service. However, please carefully investigate and prove whether the patient is a poor teacher and staff member before issuing the coupon."</p>
<p>Another letter: "I am very touched to receive the donation from Mr. Pan Shouli, which will be used as medical expenses for the children of the poor and sick. Liming is already ashamed that she cannot contribute even a little to society. Now that she has received the funds, she will follow Mr. Pan's good intentions and send 2,000 yuan of preferential treatment coupons to your office for the expenses of poor children to come to the center for treatment, and to complete Mr. Pan's good deeds."</p>
<p>(Note: The address of the center is No. 68 Simingli, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Louvain.)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Shanghai Orphanage and Foster Home <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The Shanghai Orphanage and Foster Home is located in the suburbs of Nanshi, inside the Bethel Hospital on Manufacturing Bureau Road. There are currently 246 orphans, aged from four to fourteen years old. The site covers nineteen mu. In addition to classrooms and dormitories, there is also a large sports field and a small farm for planting (vegetables and beans) and animal husbandry (raising chickens, pigs, and sheep). All work is done by the orphans. There are eleven staff members, the main one being Mr. Chen Zhengfan.</p>
<p>The orphans get up at 6:00 AM every morning. After washing up, they perform morning exercises and hold a morning meeting. At breakfast, orphans over the age of ten can eat four bowls of porridge, and orphans under the age of ten can eat three bowls of porridge. The porridge is mixed with broken wheat and served with pickled vegetables, which is very delicious. From 9:00 AM, they are divided into classes. The courses taught include Chinese, general knowledge, arithmetic, music, art, etc. The grade system is based on the ordinary primary school system, divided into grades one, two, three, four, five, and six. There are also kindergarten classes and classes for children with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>Lunch is at 12:00 PM. From 2:00 PM to 5:30 PM, most of the orphans continue to attend classes. As for the older orphans, they are assigned to work in various departments such as hairdressing and laundry. After 5:30 PM, the orphans either play in the sports field or browse books and newspapers in the library. The library currently has more than 1,000 books.</p>
<p>The orphans have dinner at 7:00 PM and go to bed at 8:00 PM. All matters in the outer room are managed by the room leader, and the order is well maintained. The behavior of all the orphans can be described as good; occasionally, newly arrived orphans will quarrel, but after undergoing considerable influence, they can return to good behavior. The "Model Children's Association" is the orphanage's children's self-government organization. In addition to inviting instructors to serve as guides, all activities in the areas of encouragement, academics, sports, and hygiene are the responsibility of the orphans themselves and are integrated with the orphanage's foster care policy.</p>
<p>Master Zhang Shiyuan's Exhibition of Paintings of Cattle Master Zhang Shiyuan will lead more than 20 of his disciples to hold a joint exhibition of teachers and students at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in the coming days. The exhibition will feature hundreds of works, all of which are exquisite. It is reported that 10% of the proceeds from the sale of the paintings will be used as charitable donations.</p>
