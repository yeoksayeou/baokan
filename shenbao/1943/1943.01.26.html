<p>社評</p>
<h3>再談實踐中日條約</h3>
<p>實踐一月九日的中日共同宣言與中日協定的條約，日前本報曾就實踐條約的精神和要旨，有所獻言。我們始終認爲中日協定，是含有積極意義的，必須從這協定的實踐中產生出無限的實力——政治上，軍事上，經濟上以及文化上的無限的實力。換句話說，中日協定的最大目標，必須從今日起向努力增加生產和增加兩國作戰的實力之途邁進，來完成兩國對新時代所負的使命。因此條約的實踐，決不是抽象的和消極的，也必須是具體的和積極的。現在我們更願就具體的實踐　法中，提出下列三個原則，以供中日當局的參考。</p>
<p>第一·在實踐中日協定的具體工作中，凡是今後適宜於完全由中國自己主持的，也就是說某種事業由中國自辦能收到比較由日本主持更大的效果的，應該毫不躊躇，儘速交給中國主持。中國方面固然要有當仁不讓的精神，作爲一種責任的擔負，而不作爲一種權利的收回，以求今後更大的效力的發揮。這種大公無私的表現，一定要貫澈於今後兩國相處的任何一言一動之中，才能澈底保障兩國今後的永遠合作。</p>
<p>第二·在實踐中日協定的具體工作中，凡是今後由中日兩國合作辦理最爲適宜的事業，無論是那種事業，都希望雙　誠意合作，採取更有效的方式，以完成中日兩國的共同使命。我們不能說一切事　都可由中國自辦，而能收獲比日本管理的效果更好。有幾種事業，也許祇有讓中日兩方在分工合作的原則之下，才能順利推進，那麽雙方都應該開誠的進行合作。</p>
<p>第三·我們至少在目前還不能不承認中日兩國的　力是相差很遠的，從政治組織，經濟結構，直到技術水準，都是不　衡的。正因爲如此，兩　的合作才有了實際上的根據，而不徒然具有理論的根據。也正爲如　，我們在實踐中日協定的具體工作中，對於有些事業，凡爲目前中國財力人力尤其是技術所未逮，由中國自己主持或中日合作辦理，都不及由日本單獨代理更有效果的，那麽在收回主權的前提之下，不妨請日方繼續主持下去，在人事，機構，工作範圍各方面，不必作仟何不必要的更張。</p>
<p>以上三點，完全是顧到實際情形，完全是爲了實際的效果，完全是爲了爲中日兩國在目前有更大的力量去戰勝共同的敵人，並日要同時顧到戰後中日兩國之永遠的合作。我們要求在條約實踐的步驟與辦法中，中日雙方都能絕對不存任何所謂面子的心理，都能絕對「大公無私」和「間誠佈公」，從實際上的需要着眼。因爲這種工作，不僅是有關中日兩國的生死存亡，而且是有關全柬亞人民的生死存亡。</p>
<p>譯諭</p>
<h3>蘇聯反攻遭受挫折</h3>
<p>希特勒總統，在對　國　軍　　歲首　辭中，闡明決心，略謂：「吾人必須以去冬之精神，克服今冬之困難。此　戰爭，決無妥協之可能。蘇聯之　　林　加里寗最高會議主席，亦於元旦發表演說，向國民呼籲：「須　最後勝　邁進」觀此　方首腦之言，足證德蘇戰局，今年　更趨激烈。蘇聯紅軍希圖在今冬極力消耗德軍之勢力，以圖一舉收復失地。而綜合最近之情報，則紅　之企圖，因德軍猛擊，已遭挫折。</p>
<p>據加里寗主席云：紅軍之對德反攻，斯達林城地區於去年十一月十九日開始，中部地區於同月廿五日開始，頓河中游地區於十二月十六日開始，自年末起，又從北　洋至高加索一帶戰綫開始反攻。紅軍之主力作戰，側重於奪　　斯托夫之役，紅軍領袖認爲將羅斯托夫克復後，可使斯達林城及北高加索之德軍陷於孤立。而從頓河，唐納資兩河之分岐點向南推進，越過瑪奴基（　音）運河而至薩里斯克之戰綫上，配置重兵，進而威脅西部，其一部份業已挺進至唐白斯一角之霞夫托伊附近，紅軍之目的地羅斯托夫，相距霞夫托伊之西南部不過六十公里。</p>
<p>位於羅斯　夫南部之北高加索方面，紅軍猛襲台萊克河岸之德軍，斯達林城方面，紅軍調集十六師大軍（包括戰車部隊六師，共計三十萬兵力。）開始總攻。頓河，瓦窩河等處，亦發動强力之反攻。中部以北之戰綫，側重於奪回維里基魯基市，列寗格勒東北部，自本月十一日起，亦在陸空聯合之下開始猛攻。北部加里安之堪達拉克拉希地區，調軍突擊當面之德芬聯軍。</p>
<p>德芬聯軍對此，暫時藏　不露，一任紅軍在局部進出，但自年初起，逐决加强反擊陣勢，本月十日友右，全錢突擊紅軍，各路大勝，紅軍喪失戰車無數，其企圖因此遭受挫折。自去年十一月二十日至本月十一日止，德軍擊毀紅軍之戰車，已達五百五十輛。於此可見此次冬季作戰激烈之一斑。德軍除作以上之反攻外，復又空　北冰洋岸之魯巴基半島及茂曼斯克港，白海岸之干達刺喀港等處，予蘇方以重創。</p>
<p>德蘇戰綫之氣候，今冬不若去冬之寒。同時德軍之禦寒設備，較去冬充實整齊，此爲紅軍冬季反攻失敗之一因。尙有一最大之失敗原因，厥爲蘇聯過於信賴英美。斯達林以爲英美在北非作戰，錐非第二戰綫，然至少對軸心軍頗有不利。故同時即對德軍發動積極作戰。但北非之情勢，於德國戰力，初無絲毫影响。英美目睹德蘇戰局之實在情形，爲之驚惶不已。但此種局勢，所予英美之打擊，實遠較蘇聯遭受之挫折，更爲悲觀。蘇聯之當局，實不能漠視此點。（企靑譯自一月十八日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>突尼西亞劇戰竟日　軸心軍獲有進展　雙方死力爭奪戰略高地　美軍自阿爾熱里亞增援</h3>
<p>瑞士京城二十四日哈瓦斯社電　突尼西亞前綫昨日劇戰竟日、據德方消息、軸心軍在艾爾芒蘇及芬杜克艾爾阿拉萊勃、獲有進展、美軍一隊在山地被圍、義方已自阿爾熱里亞派兵增援、又據義大利官方發表戰報稱、軸心軍刻正搆築新陣地、空軍亦轟炸協約國之陣綫、另據協約軍司令部發表戰報稱、德軍現向傑爾佈達普挺進、雙方爭奪番主橋及凱洛盎間之高地激戰甚烈、法國分裂派軍隊在奥斯里亞山谷亦被迫後退、另據阿爾及爾港法分裂派軍司令部宜佈、在法軍防區內降落之軸心國傘兵隊、經劇戰後已被解決、又據羅馬宣佈、的黎波里坦尼亞之軸心軍鐵甲部隊、業已佈就新防綫、現羅美爾軍與英軍僅有小規模之後衛戰、此外英美飛機曾轟炸西西里島飛行塲、居民稍有死傷、美國驅逐艦一艘亦在阿爾及里西海面被我擊沉云，里斯本二十五日同盟社電據此間所接北非消息、突尼西亞中部戰鬥日來又趨猛烈、軸心軍以機動戰術、突然轉取攻勢、在凱魯盎西北之奥賽爾蒂亞溪谷粉碎法叛軍頑抗、於二十三日奪取該谷東南戰略高地傑爾布達普、壓制由凱洛盎通至奥賽爾蒂亞之重要道路、並追擊向該溪谷西方後退之反軸心軍、刻正全力猛進中、又反軸心軍司令部亦承認法叛軍敗退、並謂傑爾布達普已陷於軸心軍手中、故法軍不得不退至傑爾烏斯拉特云、衆認軸心軍司令芬安尼姆將軍將向南北擴大凱洛盎地區之據點、强化在彭德伐斯北方所取之攻勢、故阿特拉斯山東側方面一帶法叛軍、其被殲之期當不在遠、反軸心軍深感不安、已由摩洛哥之特柏薩方面、加調美第二機械化師團及第三步兵師圍、前往增援突尼西亞軍隊云、</p>

<h3>印緬邊境</h3>
<p>— 兒玉</p>
<p>任：譯自東京朝日新聞</p>
<p>（東京朝日新聞兒玉特派員六日印緬國境阿拉干山中電）　阿拉干山，位於印緬國境交界。人烟稀少，一片荒野，乃獅虎象豹野獸潛跡之處，相傳有極多神秘之趣聞。該處形勢險要，爲大東亞共榮圈西部之天然防綫。記者於去冬擔任從軍記者？</p>
<p>深入阿拉干山脈，歷訪拱衛山中睥睨印度西部之警備勇士。該處叢林密佈，虎嘯猿啼，喪人魂膽。記者去時適爲大除夕，翌晨即在該處共慶元旦。</p>
<p>叢林中野猿成羣</p>
<p>渡過伊洛瓦底江後，即有多數阿拉干族之土民，舉手歡迎吾人入境。午後四時許，復深入山路，兩側叢林參天，野猿成羣，跳躍來去於樹上。當晚宿於山上之小屋中，拱衛該處之勇士，對於故國遠來之人，同聲歡迎。特備烤孔雀肉款待，味美可口。翌日循小路而行，道窄多險，阿拉干山屹然而立，洵爲壯觀。陽光甚烈，白畫之熱度，使人有頭痛之感，入晚後則寒氣逼人。</p>
<p>山麓邊白骨堆堆</p>
<p>埋葬於山鹿邊之遺骸白骨極多。昔因英政府不顧民生，下强制撤退命令，以緬甸爲唯一後路之印度民衆，紛紛攀越阿拉干山脈之險要，取道此間後退。自去年二月間起，經過之人，足有數十寓之多，平均十萬人之中歸返印度者不足二萬人，中途的有八萬人因飢渴不濟與中暑而亡，或爲野獸咬斃。是以山腹之中白骨堆堆，誠人世之慘事！</p>
<p>在白日晴空之下，猶感陰氣森森，據云入晚之後，必須在小屋四周，焚火驚獸，吾則即有虎類出現。</p>
<p>印度洋瞭然在目</p>
<p>山脈遙長，行無止境，十二時許，站立高峯，遙見白色茫茫，宛似天邊，其即印度洋。晚間宿於芥部隊河野隊長之帳幕中。的在深夜三時許，鳥猿叫囂之聲極烈，阿拉干之深夜，極爲熱鬧。未幾虎嘯一聲，鳥猿之聲，頓吿靜寂。虎嘯聲長，令人毛骨悚然。元旦日，氣候更寒，雖禦衣多層，猶感寒氣逼人。旭日初昇時，全體勇士，向東遙拜共迎新春，倍感興奮。</p>

<h3>一個貪污的鄉長　侵吞公款近二萬元　逍遙法外未受制裁</h3>
<p>內地政治上的腐敗現象，層出不窮，吾們也不必多事揭舉。僅僅一個鄕長的地位，也假籍了職務上便利，漁肉鄕民，侵占公款，一旦舉發，還可以逍遙自在，不受法律制裁。眞是令人氣沮。下面是湘西慈利的一偭農民，名叫蕙利的一篇苦訴與憤慨的文宇，看了也可以反映一下政治上的腐敗現象了。</p>
<p>「我們這一鄕，是僻居在湘西慈利一個地瘠民貧的小鄉區，去年因受旱災影響，秋收失望。冬春以來，一般平民，除少數得食雜糧外，其餘都是採取山上的藜藿與蕨葛來充飢。而政府發動了建國儲蓄，救國公債，一元獻機各項籌款，嚴令攤繳，貧苦者均節衣縮食，甚且忍飢耐寒，莫不一一按照派數，如限交由保長轉繳鄉長，那曉得我們這位鄕長，生就了一條麂皮喉嚨（土語，麂皮喉曨是賬不壞的意思）。收到全鄕建國儲蓄五千四百五十元。他就吞沒了三千三百九十元：救國公債四千一百五十四元，他就吞沒了二千一百二十三元六角，一元獻機二萬一千二百七十元，他就呑沒了四千五百七十九元，這還不算，他又借建修鄉倉的機會，動用積毅六十四擔外。又領到政府建倉經費一千六百五十三元一角二分，及擅自罰款一千一百七十三元，除開銷了木料，人工，雜用等項，他就吞沒了七千四百六十三元五角二分，政府向人民購買軍穀，發給補價三千九百三十六元，他也吞沒了一千七百二十二元。僅就以上這幾項來說，便合共侵呑爲數達一萬九千二百七十八元一角二分之鉅。於是激動了我們全鄕人民的憤慨，即將其侵呑數目，分類列表，星請縣府查辦。縣府馬上派了兩個科員，來到鄕公所，召集各保保長。進鄕長早已趕耒受訓，乃在鄕長家裏，追出賬簿，與各保長繳納各種款項之數，逐一對照淸算，復傳集建倉的木工與經手人，查詢實支建倉費用，都與我們人民所檢舉的數目，無多出入。這位鄉長的家屬，着了急，遂以重賄要求這兩位科員從中緩頰，這兩位科員，還算有良心，不肯接受，但我們老百姓尙有幾點不可解的地方：（一）據最近報載雲南某縣縣長，爲侵呑公款，正式綁赴刑塲，予以槍決。以前薛岳下車伊始的時候，也會槍斃過貪污五百元的稅務局長，爲什麼我們這位鄉長，侵吞公款，已經縣府派縣查實者達一萬九千餘元之巨，現選能在耒陽安然受訓。（二）現在的政治機構，組織上不能不說應有盡有，如督導鄉政，則派有指導員隨時督導，如鄉公所關於經濟方面，則設有經濟股專負其責，爲什麼我們這位鄉長，侵吞了浙麼多　公款，還須要人民來檢舉，　能知道，我們鄉公所收繳款項的賬簿，不在經濟股，而在鄕長家裏，想來其他鄉區或不至如此吧」！（惠公寄自三十一年十二月廿日）</p>

<p>— 聶雲台</p>
<p>觀無量壽佛經也說，欲往生者須修三福，一切經都是說明欲成佛道，須先度濟衆生。因爲佛法以大悲心爲根本，若無大悲心，就一切都是虛假。雖然吃齋念佛，等到命終之時，業　太多，菩薩不見面，鬼卒却來前。那時佛念全失，平日由貪瞋痴所造的來，果報成熟，依然墮入餓鬼畜生地獄道裏去，悔之晚矣。我看近來社會上自以爲信佛的人很多，多半不明佛理，有幾百萬幾千萬的資財，勉强做了幾千元善事，就以已經做了功德，所以爲詳細說此一段，「望其覺悟。再有俄國托爾斯泰說過：「現在社會的人，左手進了百萬元。右手施一二元，就稱爲大　　家」。可知　種行　，是世界的通病，普通人　　　　，念佛人又何能逃罪呢，</p>
<p>我略將上文結束。條列如下：</p>
<p>（一）數十年所見富人，後代全已衰落。</p>
<p>（二）六十年來文武大官世家，都已衰落，後人不興。</p>
<p>（三）惟有不肯發財幾個大官，子孫尙能讀書上進。</p>
<p>（四）官極大，發財的機會極多，而不肯發肘，念念在救濟衆人的，子孫發達最昌盛，最長久，一一都有歷史事實爲證。</p>
<p>（五）上海　幾個　例，有的三千萬，四千萬，及幾萬萬的幾　，忽然一日全　　　　家都是不肯做救濟善舉的。</p>
<p>（六）大富的家，止顧自己闊綽享用，積錢留與子孫，見有飢荒，不肯出大宗的錢救濟災難，無異犯殺人罪，要受道德的譴責，業報的支配。</p>
<p>（七）佛法天理，就在人人心中，人人所感謝的人，天就歡喜，人人所怨怒的事，天就發怒。古語云：千人所指，無病而死，尙書云，「天視自我民視，天聽自我民聽」，華嚴　　：「若令衆生生歡喜者，則令一切如來歡喜」。所以欲求得福，須多造福於人，否則佛天亦無奈何</p>
<p>（八）富人求神拜佛。燒香念經，若不起大慈悲心捨財濟衆，即是功小罪大，難逃惡報。</p>
<h3>在滬業已公畢　重光大使昨日返京　連日與各方面舉行懇談</h3>
<p>日本駐華特命全權大使重光葵氏、自本月十九日來滬後、業已一週、茲以與各方接洽要公已畢、乃於昨日上午九時、乘車返京、重光大使此次來滬、尙爲國府對英美宜戰後之第一次、在滬期內、曾迭與我方當局、及日本陸海軍最高首腦、德意軸心國天使、法大使、以及其他各方面代表、舉行重要會議、如十九日會見日駐華派遣軍畑總司令、及日駐華艦隊司令吉田大將、業於二十三日由日派遣軍報導部予以發表、二十日午後三時、列席中國國民外交促進會成立典禮、二十一日下午五時、出席德國史塔瑪大使在國際飯店舉行之茶會、二十二日下午四時、在華懋飯店與褚外長舉行懇談、同日下午五時半、在意大使官邸與戴良誼大使舉行懇談、下午七時出席陳市長晚餐會、二十三日上午十一時在大使宿舍與戈思默法大使舉行懇談、二十四日上午召集來滬出席領事會議之各地領事、聽取各領事報吿各地情報、</p>
<h3>廿五期　戶口糧　買單數量不動　出售祇有五天</h3>
<p>工部局爲調節民食、統制糧食後、產區主要食糧、已統一收購實　配給制度、關於滬市民食長期維持、第廿五期戶口糧發售日期、業經商妥自二月一日起至七日爲止、其中五六兩天爲總結束期、停止發售、八日爲最後一日例停、所以下期發售日期實際爲一·二·三·四·七·等五天、二十六期自二月九日起至十七日止、十八日例停、二十七期自二月十九日起至二十七日止、二十八日例停、三月份起則恢復十天一期舊制、至下期戶口糧、各立約米店已開始領買單、該項買米單上所列白米與麵粉之搭配額、仍與上期相同、其價格爲（一）白米每包（一石二斗半）三百元另四角、（二）麵粉每包九十二元、故該期授糧、或仍爲白米二升麵粉一斤十二兩、價格亦當不動、</p>
<h3>國民外交與參戰　吳凱聲廣播辭</h3>
<p>吳凱聲氏於十月二十四日晚應中華民族反英美協會邀請、在上海電臺廣播關於國民外交與參戰問　、大意如下、</p>
<p>政府當局宣吿參戰、絕不是一種空泛的飾詞、乃是政府與國民在道義上一致覺悟的表示、政府當局竭力設法使政治軍事經濟文化各方面、在適應戰時體制外、更須喚起民衆促進自主更新的外交、否則儘管政府當局怎樣努力、結果也不免事倍功半、或竟成爲紙上談兵而已、</p>
<p>所謂國民外交、乃是動員全國的國民—包括國民的意旨與力量、—來做國家外交的後盾和前鋒、換一句話說、就是站在國民的立塲、盡國民的責任、與政府協調、貢獻一切、爲外交上努力、簡言之即「國民有外交權」、當然「國民外交」並非是指純以國民一部份的輿論來代表一國的外交政策、也不是說依一般國民的私見來統制、或干涉政府的外交方針、最合理的是政府當局確定一正當的外交路綫、然後策勵全體國民、循此新途徑邁進、</p>
<p>國民外交的意義已經解釋明白、再就參戰與它的關係各方面、作一概略的檢討、</p>
<p>我國政府當局自入戰時狀態後、應盡力促使國民對於外交意識頓然覺醒、動員全國人力物力、貢獻一切、犧牲一切、與友邦人民駢肩作戰、同甘共苦、協力邁進、以求大東亞戰爭的早日完遂、同時友邦當局也當體會國人一番合作的誠意和犧牲的精神、消除過去猜疑成見、確立同情的心理、雙方朝野坦白相對、互相接受雙方的親善外交、又互惠以平等的待遇、這可以說是參戰後我國國民對友邦的一種「道義援助」、國民外交促進會成立的本旨、就在乎求此理想的實現、</p>
<p>當局倡導國民外交即是尊重國民地位、重視民意的先聲、參戰後、對於融洽中日兩國感情這一點、當然是不可忽視、現在友邦毅然交還租界、撤廢治外法權、意大利亦種起隨之、這樣眞誠的表示、很足以感動我國朝野、可是還希望當局更進一步、儘量减少國民「共苦」的時間、迅速謀求「同甘」事實的表現、茍能使國民現實生活安定、國民心理當然也會好轉、這樣、兩國民間的感情、才能眞正的融洽、兩國的合作、也能有眞實的效力、這是促進「國民外交」的最主要目標、也可以說是我國國民在參戰後最深切的期望、</p>
<p>國府毅然參戰、表示政府以十二萬分決心、和日本合作、以「同死共生」「同苦共甘」的精神、凡我國人、都應擁護、鄙人認爲國人應把「同生共死」改爲「同死共生」、「同甘共苦」改爲同苦共甘」、先有死的決心、從死中求生、先有耐苦的精神、以求苦盡甘來、</p>
<p>求東亞民族的眞正解放、求世界的全面永久和平、中日兩國應誠心誠意、團結一體、以國民外交為前提、貫澈國父的大亞洲主義、聯合東亞被壓迫民族共同奮鬥、最後、希望國民應策勵本會同人、在自主更新、促進和平排除惡勢貫澈遺敎維護僑胞的五大綱領之下、努力促進國民外交、</p>

<h3>年關期迫　魚市塲改現款交易</h3>
<p>値此年關迫近、滬市工商各業銀根緊、本市冰鮮魚同業公會魚市塲辦事處、業經議決、凡持有交易証之買戶、自今日起至二月六日止、暫時一律改爲現款交易、至二月七日恢復舊制、</p>
<h3>當局亟謀安定物價　加緊統制貨物來源　擴大食品配給範圍調整供應　各業公會擔任主要中心工作</h3>
<p>消息靈通方面訊、兩租界當局、日昨起統制製造商及批發商出售物品之價格、而使零售物價亦得穩定後、頃擬進一步統制本市商品之來源、尤以主要食品爲甚、其目的在維持各種主要食品之常川供應、而使業已實行於食米·麵包·及麵粉等之配給制度、範圍得以擴大、而至包括各種主要食品在內、據悉、此事當局尙在考慮中、一旦實行、將由同業公會擔任配給　構之主鍵、</p>
<p>各業公會造冊呈報</p>
<p>查本市各當局、對於主要商品、監督素甚嚴格、並迭經　　條例、勸　各業一體遵行、凡各主要商品之同業公會應　所屬會員、造具清冊、載明下列各項、呈報主管官署查核、（一）會員脾號（二）買賣人姓名、（三）營業所在地、（四）經營主要商品之種類、（五）核准登記日期、（六）登記號數、（七）須詳細塡明、不得稍有含糊或僞報、否則該業公會、將受法律制裁、</p>
<p>批發價格彙報存查</p>
<p>至於各公會之會員兼營批發之業務者、應於每十天將下列各該事項報吿所屬同業公會、由公會接得報吿書後、於月終分戶記明、彙報全營機關備查、計（一）批發數量、價格、　及批人之商號、（二）售出之數量及價格與售出之商號、（三）積存數量、（四）堆存地點、上述各點、務須詳情不遺、倘有違反前項之規定者、處以一千元以下罰金、按照當局新頒辦法、批發商應將本月二十三日出售物品價格及成本計算、抄表於二月十日以前彙報</p>

<p>宵禁辦法、自上年九月十六日起宣告撤消、自同日起、市民應即隨時携帶市民證、以備沿途巡捕案閱、否則當予扣留盤詰、按宵禁辦法、係於一九三三年中日戰事時第一次實行、於一九三七年間第二次實施、當時規定每晚十時至翌晨五時之間、市民不得外出、宵禁鐘點、曾於同年九月二日改為每晚十一時半至翌晨五時、復於一九三八年三月十二日改為每晚十二時半至翌晨五時、直至宵禁辦法廢止之日為止、</p>
<p>提早收塲時間</p>
<p>上年年初本局曾規定各公共塲所應於每晚十時收塲、藉以節减用電、收塲時間曾於二月間准予展緩至十一時、至八月間再展延一小時至午夜十二時為止、但以各該塲所能遵守防空規則、並不得超過該定用電量為條件、</p>
<p>車照通用辦法</p>
<p>查按照一九四一年十二月十日本局與市政府所訂滬西財務協定、市區或租界所發之私人汽車執照、得在各該區內互相通用、法租界公董局對於此事、亦表同意、爰自上年一月一日起、實行私人汽車執照在三區通用之辦法、復經三區市政當局會商之結果、同意將上項聯合執照辦法、推及私人脚踏車、自上年七月一日起、試辦六個月、</p>
<p>不得擅自加租</p>
<p>一九四一年間、本局感覺對於房租問題及禁收小費各項、有加以管理之必要、此項問題、曾經兩租界當局會同組織一委員會、聯合討論、本局嗣於一九四一年十二月二十四日刋發布告、勸告業主體恤無力應付巨額租金之租戶、雙方倘有爭執、可提請本局房租調解委員會調解、在三月三十一日以前、業主不准强迫租戶遷讓、並不得擅自加租、關於加租之限制、旋經改為如業主與租戶雙方同意、或經本局調解委員會核准者、得提增租金、</p>
<p>轉租房屋領照</p>
<p>本局為救濟一般三房客起見、上年曾擬具地產章程附則第五十五條一項、呈奉領事團核准、按照該附則之規定、於四月一日實施轉租房屋領照辦法、通飭界內各住宅房屋之二房東、領取轉租執照、執照我條例最重要者為限制二房東應得之利潤、並禁止索取小費、</p>
<p>設職業介紹科</p>
<p>本局為救濟失業工人起見、曾於上年九月間、決定籌設職業介紹科、其任務係為失業　工介紹相當位置、本局並經核准添雇職員、進行該科之重要籌備工作、</p>
<p>保障兒童事務</p>
<p>太平洋戰事發動以後、本市經濟狀况改觀、因此與本局合作救濟兒童之慈善機關、大都遭受嚴重困難、拒絕繼續收留難童、本局有鑒於此、曾採取臨時辦法、利用救世軍乞丐收容所、收容無家可歸之兒童、一面添雇工作人員十人、設法將被棄兒童返還其家屬、或代覓願意收養之人、</p>
<p>發行防水公債</p>
<p>為進行防水計劃起見、曾於上年六月間發行六厘公債五百萬元、此項公債、定自一九四八年十二月起、每年抽籤還本一次、至一九五七年十二月全部淸還、</p>
<p>統制糧食物品</p>
<p>關於糧食供應、以及其他物品之維持問題、由一專門委員會注視之、該委員會之工作報告另詳、茲不贅述、　（未完）</p>

<h3>蘇浙雜糧　即將統制收買</h3>
<p>當局對於蘇浙各地出產之米·小麥棉花　主要農產品、均已統制收買惟對雜糧一項、尚無統制機關之設立、茲悉當局方面、鑒於雜糧一項、蘇浙各地出產頗巨、亦有加以統制必要、故最近已令上海·南京·蘇州·杭州等地中日雜糧商、分別組織雜糧一俟各地之收買機構完全成立後、再行組織統制收買華中雜糧之最高機關云、</p>
<p>本市雜糧交易昨仍祗豆餅略有授受、市因貨主扳高、而呈挺俏、計開元隆豆餅二車、價爲五十七元至五十六元、肥字豆餅三車、價一百〇五元至一百〇七元、豆類等未有正式做開、喊價殊昂、</p>
<h3>棉布行市回跌</h3>
<p>棉布市况、因報載當局將嚴格統制物價、在未得准許以前、不許抬價、故人心頓虛、行市乃吿回低、細布等均跌十餘元、四君子嗶嘰自十一元二角降至十元六角、中途頗多飄忽、結果爲十元九角、軋低三角五分、色布桃花女士林現貨喊四八〇元、白貓花布二五〇元、</p>
<h3>防雨布亦漲價</h3>
<p>防雨布、昨市大見好轉、行情均見激漲、金熊牌每碼喊沽二十八元、大鳴牌二十四元、人猿泰山二十二元、市貨存底尙不多、因廠方受原料紗綫昂貴、來去栘動請求困難、出品各家均少、買方需要、　續不絕、以致亦吿漲價矣、</p>

<p>呢絨毛織品日來始終成爲缺乏昂貴局面、交易雖减色、而貨主仍一味居奇、蓋門莊零沽價目、低於市　上躉批售價也、故各呢絨店舖、大半均不願標掛零沽行情、且多貼印限購一件字樣、</p>
<h3>日烟配给充裕</h3>
<p>香烟市面昨日做價、英美貨稍見挺秀、但亦不脫盤旋、因年關在即、有貨足銷者暫時觀望、靜候華中烟草組合成立後、如何配給、故價格不致昂漲、日烟穩靜、因今日起開派甲乙兩卡零售同行、期限三天、故配給頗爲充裕、價乃平定如恒、做價大英牌一萬二千元、老刀脾一萬零二百元、品海牌七千六百五十元、五華牌六千六百五十元、仙女牌八千元、較週末升起一二百元之譜、日烟金槍牌三千元、金大樓三千七百五十元、紅玫瑰二千七百元、全祿牌三千五百元、指南牌二千八百五十元、國烟金字塔六千四百元、美麗牌五千八百元、金鼠牌四千一百元、白金龍四千一百五十元、甚鮮變動、</p>
<h3>日用品變動微</h3>
<p>日用品市面、近來步漲不已、昨價漲風已戢、但終以存貨稀少、買得不易、故執貨者、依勢論價、昨日成交雖稀、價尙平穩、計美麗牌火柴四千元、鳳凰牌三千八百五十元、金鼎牌一二千二百元、雜脾二千一百五十元、固本皂七百八十元、白祥茂七百三十元、黃祥茂六百六十元、剪刀皂七百五十元、白禮氏洋燭五百六十元、僧帽牌四百八十元、雜牌三百四士元、更動甚微、藥品市價、稍見昂騰、計頭痛粉三十七元、萬金油四十八元、八卦丹四十三元五角、鷓鴣菜六十八元、龍虎人丹三十五元、</p>
<h3>剪口鐵存底薄</h3>
<p>各種厚薄大小剪口鐵、市上流通貨並不十分充沛、幸本客去化蕭條、一時尙無供求失衡之象、查是貨滬埠存底因來源久缺影響、早經軋缺、兼受日久之耗用、現貨更　單薄、執有少量存底之同業、心思高昂、且目今大方塊長塊諸正號貨、刻市有無從覓處之虞、市上流通者僅各種厚薄不勻、大小不等之副號剪口　而已、昨市母噸沽一萬元左右、心思昂俏者亦有喊售一萬一千元光景、</p>
<h3>中莊園肉　開價尚宜</h3>
<p>中莊園肉、業外來貨、昨有開出五十件、貨品身份尙平、色澤較次、比高莊　差百五十碼之譜、當即如數分通、海南貨號方近到六百餘包、照貨主意思、未肯購卸、故叫價反較申市爲昂、</p>
<h3>金山枝到存俱厚</h3>
<p>金山枝近市以底存較厚、號行盤俱乏軒輊、查來源日前又到五千餘箱、以大結束期伊邇、號方及貨主俱不欲隨市即售、春市或能略振云、</p>
<h3>白皮藥芡市緊</h3>
<p>白皮藥芡以久無到貨、市存至爲軋缺、故上莊陳貨叫價亦高、昨有客貨一批身色俱屬可觀、行方還四百元、猶未成交、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>貧賤夫妻</h3>
<p>— 賈生</p>
<p>太有錢，夫婦之間不容易處得好；太窮苦，夫婦之間，也不容易處得好。太有錢，「夫」往往在外尋花問柳；「婦」也往往沉迷於烟賭，結果，同牀異夢，徒有夫婦之名。這種人在飽暖之餘，爲非作歹，咎由自取，無足憐惜。</p>
<p>本文所要談的，是貧賤夫妻。詩人曾說：「貧賤夫妻百事哀」，細味這句詩，牛衣對泣的窘態，便如在目前了。</p>
<p>儘管提倡精神文明，儘管說精神重於物質；可是精神脫離了物質，就成爲空虛，幻滅，自欺欺人的名詞而已！我國歷史上，有兩對貧賤夫妻，可以研究，一是朱買臣，一是梁鴻。</p>
<p>朱買臣是漢武帝時會稽人。他沒有成名時，家裏很窮，賣薪自給，且行且讀，妻以爲羞，離婚而去。後買臣任會稽太守，見故妻與夫在築路。買臣命後車載其夫婦入太守舍。妻慚忿，自縊死。</p>
<p>梁鴻是東漢平陵人，少孤貧，有氣節，年長，博覽羣書，牧豬爲生。娶妻孟光，同隱覇陵山。後梁鴻爲人賃春，每歸妻爲具食，舉案齊眉。</p>
<p>朱買臣的故事，便是俗傳的「覆水難收」故事。梁鴻的故事，便是舉案齊眉的美談。歷史上，關於夫婦的離合，沒有統計；不過這兩對貧賤夫妻，可說是一個絕好的對比。</p>
<p>我想，　乎朱買臣的故事，現社會上很多。雖不一定離婚而去，但因丈夫不做官不發財而吵鬧，　是家常便飯。至於梁鴻夫婦安　樂道的故事，其僅見，恐怕如管鮑之交吧！</p>
<p>我國自從實施新敎育以來，一切盲從　美的享樂主義，個人主義。女子敎育操之於敎會，結果造或一批花瓶式的「摩登」女子。她們只會唱歌，跳舞；她們只知道蜜月旅行，營養化學，和衛生設備。有些女學生，爲了享樂，竞墮落到爲富家姬妾。女子敎育沒落到如此，還有什麽話可說！</p>
<p>所以，不少受過敎育的女子，常常遲嫁或獨身；除非可以嫁給資格比她高一級而又有家產的丈夫。如果嫁後，夫家中落，那非逼丈夫去做官發財不可。在她們看來，孟光是愚不可及的傻子。</p>
<h3>吃粥</h3>
<p>— 春秋</p>
<p>目前計口所授的糧，十天所得，大約只够五日吃用。無可奈何，全天吃粥。其方式是：用少量之米，加多量之水，煮成薄而不能再薄的粥。</p>
<p>三個孩子每天吃粥的後果，是小便特多。這因爲粥中過多的水分，通過了　腸，到達腎　，就變成小便。時當冬令，小便本多；再加吃粥，於是小便之多出乎意料之外。白天，時常撒在褲子裏；晚上時常撒在被窩裏。幽默地說一句：乾派的孩子，變成濕派了。這是物質不滅的定律在作祟，並不是孩子缺少吸水分的能力。不忍加以實備，只希望戶口米的分量，能够增加，改吃粥爲吃飯。</p>
<p>孩子吃慣了粥，在盛粥的時候，懂得門檻了。儘可　把勺子向鍋底打撈。這樣，比較乾而厚的粥被盛取了。哲學家說，遇到困難，智慧才會表現出來，是有其根據的。</p>
<p>有時候，粥鍋裏靠底的一部分燒焦了，凝成粥塊，又厚又香。偶然被一個孩子撈取了，於是另外兩個孩子　起來了。孔子說：「不　寡而中　不均」。同時都吃薄粥了，可是如果有些不均，還是要　料紛的。</p>
<p>做父母的，所吃的粥，當然是最薄而又最少。保身和傳種，是人類的兩大任務。爲了維持自己的生命綫，世界上起了種種的生死鬥爭，彼此不肯退讓。世界上，只有父母對於兒女，却情願犧牲「保身」，而維持「傳種」。</p>
<p>有人說，和尙戒律森嚴，幾百個和尙同時吃粥，毫沒聲音。還有人說，廣東雞粥，鴨粥別有風味。還有人說，吃了油膩，吃些粥，可以减少腸胃病。還有人說，某大公司，看準吃粥的人家日多，預備新製幾種醬菜應時。這些話，我們做父母的，在吃粥的時候，沒有此閒情逸政來說：孩子們，在吃粥的時候，也沒有興致來聽。</p>
<h3>數字癖</h3>
<p>— 賈生</p>
<p>學校裏，用分數來表示各學生的成績，並用分數來鼓勵各學生的努力。一般學生在溫習或考試的時候，總希望各項功課多得分數，最好都是一百分。表示分數之多寡，用數字，於是，每個學生都染了數字癖：而且，越是發憤努力的學生，其數字癖越深。</p>
<p>現代是科學世界，一切事物，差不多都以數字來表示。數字之大的，如表示各星球的距離，所謂天文數字。數字之小的，如表示電子的半徑。其他如飛機的速度，貨物的生產量，營業的多少，一切都以數字來表示，而有許多常以打破紀録為榮。世界是數字的世界，人生也是數字的人生了。這樣，每個人都非患了數字癖不成！</p>
<p>你厭惡數字嗎？如果你眞正討厭數字，你就將無法生活。</p>
<p>銀行家，資本家，尤其是投機家，他們可說會都患着數字癖。他們整天在想，在研究：怎麽樣就可多賺幾十萬幾百萬，怎麼樣就可獲得百分之一百，百分之二百的利潤。他們的人生觀是財產的數字加大，加大，以至無限大。在最近四五年前，能够滿足他們的數字，有六位七位可以了。現在却不行，非八位九位不可！</p>
<p>目前，一個小職員，起碼薪水要三位數字了。一個黃包車夫，每天收入，起碼要兩位數字，否則他們只得活活地餓死。所以小職員以至黃包車夫們，也都患着數字癖。</p>
<p>有不少「戒之在得」的董事長和經理先生，太注意自己的數字之加大了。對於職員和夥計們的數字，却常疏忽。職員和夥計們，「活」呢，固然「活」不去；「死」吧，卻又不敢「死」；因此「死」也需要很大的數字，至少四位吧！</p>
<h3>宏仁醫院訪問記</h3>
<p>— 碩</p>
<p>創立有七十餘年歷史，服務社會，造福人羣的宏仁醫院，在愛文義路成都路的一角。爲明瞭最近設施的情形起見，特地前往作了一次訪問。</p>
<p>當記者到院時，承主以敬醫帥招待參觀。和藹的態度，誠摯的情意，令人起敬。該院原名廣仁，戰事後改稱今名。與九江路的同仁醫院，是在同一系統下的，宏仁專收女子，同仁專收男子，兩院合計共有五百多個床位。職工約有四百餘人，醫療科目，應有盡有，規模相當完備。</p>
<p>經費的來源，診費醫藥費的收入，占着大部分此外，有美國敎會的津貼，所以往年不足之數，原可藉此彌補，可是從大東亞戰　發生後，該項津貼斷絕而物價激劇上　藥品棉花紗布之類，由數倍漲至數十倍不等，因此，就陷入雖於維持之勢。該院向來注意到平民福利設施，取費旣少，賠本愈大，普通病人，每日連膳宿僅收四元，現在每月開支，宏仁須二十四萬元，同仁須十二萬元，偌大的經費，眞有些左右爲難，預計到明年爲止，約缺四五十萬元，現正進行募捐，極盼社會各方的熱心援助。</p>
<p>院內職工待遇，也很菲薄，生活津貼，普通僅一百元左右，每年於春秋二季，招攷護士各五十名，程度須在初中以上，予以三年訓練，學膳費均免，　籍服裝費原亦供給，近以經濟支絀，概須自備，畢業後留院工作或介紹他處服務，成績都很良好，有志學習護士的人，倒是一個很好的機會。</p>
<p>該院與聖約翰大學的醫科，有着密切關係，院內醫師，大多爲約翰的敎授，約翰的醫科畢業生，亦例須到　院實習。共中產科史爲完善，每年在該院產生的小兒，約在四五千名左右，設備精良，看護週密，爲社會各方所交口稱譽的。</p>
<p>最後有兩件事似乎特別値得一提，一是社會上有一種跡近欺詐的醫生，妄登廣吿，例如說收費低廉，一應在內等等，人家貪了便宜，去則上當，轉送入該院醫治者，屢見不鮮，旣損金錢，又有生命危險，應予嚴密檢查取締，二是病人中要算敎師爲最可憐，收入微薄，生活淸苦，過低則生活不慣，稍高則不勝負担，擬請社會熱心人士特別籌劃一　經費，專作優待清塞敎師之用，如能實現，確是很有意義和價値</p>
<p>臨行，參觀了全院一週，歸來的時候，已近傍晚，而這種種印象，猶縈迴在腦際呢。</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hiltno著　依今譯</p>
<p>（九）</p>
<p>這是一種服務，這服務給了他自由，使他可以最高度地完全地顧着他自己。由於年高德劭，他已贏得了獨往獨來特權；那些稍稍怪僻的人，時常會攻擊敎師們和牧師們，他也已獲得他們這種權利。他身上的長袍總要着到差不多破碎得不能拼合成一塊的地步：他站在大堂階石旁木櫈上點名時，就有着神秘地不拘儀式的神氣。他管理着學校名單，捲縮在一塊板上的長長的一張紙；每一個學生，走過的時候，說出自己的名字，等吉普斯查對了在名單上作一個小記號。他在查對時的一瞥，是全校中大家都喜歡仿傚了取樂的事情——鋼邊的眼鏡滑下了鼻梁，一條高一條低的眉毛彈了起來，作着一半　興一半嘲弄的注視。在有風的日子，他的長袍·白髮·和學校名單，飄動得非常混亂，全部事情就成了可笑的一局，介在下午游戲與回復上課這二者之間。</p>
<p>其中有些名字，好像若干節小小的合唱曲，此後不必用力去記憶，也會重新在心頭浮現起來。……阿因斯渥次·阿特烏特·阿逢穆爾·巴勃喀克·巴格斯·巴那德·巴森斯威特·巴特斯培·柏格爾斯·柏德福德·奔得利·柏斯特……</p>
<p>另外一節</p>
<p>……恩斯札·凡爾期·華德海·華格期塔夫·華林頓·華特爾斯第一·華特爾斯第二·華特林·華文納，威勃……</p>
<p>另外還有一節，他曾會對第四班的　丁文學生說過，正是六音步（Hexumeter）的最好例證。</p>
<p>……蘭開斯特·拉頓·李馬爾·李頓·麥克高尼加·曼斯菲……</p>
<p>他時常思考着，這些人都到那裏去了呢；他曾一度握在一起的千絲寓縷，牠們到底散亂到了多少遠呢，有些斷了吧，其他已經織成不可知的花樣了吧？世事的混亂無常搖惑了他，那種混亂風常，祇要世界存在着，就永不會再給那些合唱曲有什麼意義。</p>
<p>在勃洛克菲爾德的背後，霧淸的時候，可以看見重疊橫着的山嶺　同樣，在勃洛克菲爾德的背後，他看見了變化與衝突的世界；他看見這世界，他還沒有覺察到，是和加娣被紀念的眼睛一同看見的。她沒有能够將她所有的心智都贈給他，更沒有將她心智上的長處贈給他；但是她却留給他安靜與坦蕩，這是和他內心的情緒很相調和的。他的特徵就是他不和極端愛國者一樣，拼命反對布爾人（Boers）並非爲了他是一個贊助布爾人的人—他在傳統上絕對不會如此，他就厭惡那種自命贊助布爾人的人；可是，雖然這樣，在他的心裏却時時有這樣的念頭：布爾人是從事於一種鬥爭，這和英國歷史上若干英雄所作的鬥爭，正有奇異的相似性—例如醒者赫爾華德（Herward　theWake）或加拉克塔克斯（Caractacus）。他有一次，曾想提出這個意見，來震驚他所敎的第五班，可是他們只想這是他所作的小小笑話之一。　（二十一）</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on the Implementation of the Sino-Japanese Treaty</h3>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration of January 9th and the Sino-Japanese Treaty, this newspaper has previously offered suggestions on the spirit and essence of implementing the treaty. We have always believed that the Sino-Japanese Agreement contains positive significance, and that unlimited strength must be generated from the practice of this agreement—unlimited strength in politics, military affairs, economy, and culture. In other words, the greatest goal of the Sino-Japanese Agreement must be to strive to increase production and increase the strength of the two countries in combat from today onwards, in order to fulfill the mission of the two countries to the new era. Therefore, the practice of the treaty must not be abstract and passive, but must be concrete and active. Now, we would like to propose the following three principles regarding concrete implementation methods for the reference of the Sino-Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>First, in the concrete work of implementing the Sino-Japanese Agreement, anything that is suitable for China to preside over completely in the future, that is, any undertaking that can achieve greater results if China manages it itself than if Japan presides over it, should be handed over to China for management as soon as possible without hesitation. The Chinese side must have the spirit of not shirking responsibility, regarding it as an assumption of responsibility, rather than a recovery of rights, in order to achieve greater effectiveness in the future. This selfless manifestation must be implemented in every word and deed of the two countries' interactions in the future in order to thoroughly guarantee the eternal cooperation of the two countries in the future.</p>
<p>Second, in the concrete work of implementing the Sino-Japanese Agreement, for any undertakings that are most suitable for cooperation between China and Japan in the future, regardless of the type of undertaking, we hope that both sides will cooperate sincerely and adopt more effective methods to complete the common mission of China and Japan. We cannot say that all matters can be managed by China alone and achieve better results than Japanese management. There are some undertakings that may only be able to proceed smoothly under the principle of division of labor and cooperation between China and Japan, so both sides should conduct cooperation openly.</p>
<p>Third, we must at least admit that the strengths of China and Japan are very different at present. From political organization and economic structure to technical standards, they are unbalanced. Precisely because of this, the cooperation between the two countries has a practical basis, rather than merely a theoretical one. Also, precisely because of this, in the concrete work of implementing the Sino-Japanese Agreement, for some undertakings that are currently beyond China's financial and human resources, especially its technology, it is more effective for Japan to act alone than for China to preside over it alone or for China and Japan to cooperate. Then, under the premise of recovering sovereignty, it is advisable to invite the Japanese side to continue to preside over it, without making any unnecessary changes in personnel, institutions, or scope of work.</p>
<p>The above three points fully consider the actual situation, fully consider the actual effect, and are completely for the purpose of enabling China and Japan to have greater strength at present to defeat the common enemy, and at the same time to take into account the eternal cooperation between China and Japan after the war. We demand that in the steps and methods of treaty implementation, both China and Japan must absolutely not harbor any so-called face-saving mentality, and must absolutely be "selfless" and "open and honest," focusing on practical needs. Because this work is not only related to the life and death of China and Japan, but also to the life and death of all the people of East Asia.</p>

<h3>Soviet Counter-Offensive Suffers Setback</h3>
<p>President Hitler, in his New Year's address to the German military, elaborated his determination, roughly saying: "We must overcome the difficulties of this winter with the spirit of last winter. This war has no possibility of compromise." Chairman Kalinin of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also delivered a speech on New Year's Day, calling on the people: "We must move towards final victory." Observing the words of the leaders of both sides, it is sufficient to prove that the German-Soviet war will become even more intense this year. The Soviet Red Army attempted to exhaust the strength of the German army as much as possible this winter in order to recover lost territory in one fell swoop. However, according to recent information, the Red Army's attempt has been thwarted by the German army's fierce attack.</p>
<p>According to Chairman Kalinin, the Red Army's counter-offensive against Germany began in the Stalingrad area on November 19th last year, in the central area on November 25th, and in the middle reaches of the Don River on December 16th. Since the end of the year, it has launched counter-offensives from the northern ocean to the Caucasus front. The Red Army's main operation focused on the battle to seize Rostov. Red Army leaders believed that after recovering Rostov, the German forces in Stalingrad and the North Caucasus could be isolated. Proceeding south from the divergence point of the Don and Donets rivers, heavy troops were deployed across the Manukee (phonetic) Canal to the Salsk front, further threatening the west. Part of it has advanced to the area near Xiafu Tuoi in the corner of Donbass. The Red Army's destination, Rostov, is only 60 kilometers southwest of Xiafu Tuoi.</p>
<p>In the North Caucasus area located south of Rostov, the Red Army launched a fierce attack on the German army on the banks of the Terek River. In the Stalingrad area, the Red Army mobilized 16 divisions (including 6 tank divisions, totaling 300,000 troops) to launch a general offensive. Powerful counter-offensives were also launched in the Don and Vawow rivers. The front line in the central and northern regions focused on retaking the city of Velikiye Luki. In the northeastern part of Leningrad, a fierce attack was also launched on the 11th of this month with the joint efforts of the army and air force. In the Kandarlaksha area of northern Karelia, troops were mobilized to attack the German-Finnish forces facing them.</p>
<p>The German-Finnish forces temporarily concealed themselves and allowed the Red Army to make local advances and retreats. However, since the beginning of the year, they have gradually strengthened their counter-attack posture. On the 10th of this month, they launched a full-scale attack on the Red Army and won great victories on all fronts. The Red Army lost countless tanks, and its attempt was thus frustrated. From November 20th of last year to the 11th of this month, the German army destroyed 550 Red Army tanks. This shows a glimpse of the intensity of this winter operation. In addition to the above-mentioned counter-offensives, the German army also launched air raids on the Rubaqi Peninsula on the Arctic coast and the ports of Murmansk and Kantalakska on the White Sea coast, inflicting heavy damage on the Soviet side.</p>
<p>The climate on the German-Soviet front this winter is not as cold as last winter. At the same time, the German army's cold-weather equipment is more complete and tidy than last winter, which is one of the reasons for the Red Army's failure in its winter counter-offensive. The biggest reason for the failure is that the Soviet Union over-relied on Britain and the United States. Stalin believed that the British and American operations in North Africa were at least unfavorable to the Axis forces. Therefore, he simultaneously launched active operations against the German army. However, the situation in North Africa had no impact on Germany's combat power. Britain and the United States were alarmed by the real situation of the German-Soviet war. However, the blow to Britain and the United States from this situation is actually more pessimistic than the setbacks suffered by the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities must not ignore this point.

<h3>Central Voronezh District German Army Shortens Defense Line Automatically Abandoning Bridgehead Forts Stalingrad's Isolated Army Achieves Immortal Feats</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th, Allied Press Urgent Telegram. The German High Command announced today that in order to shorten the defense line, the German army withdrew from the Voronezh bridgehead on the Don River without being subjected to Soviet pressure. The Soviet army launched an offensive on the long front south of Voronezh, but was painfully attacked by the German army, suffered heavy damage, and retreated. The High Command also praised the heroic resistance of the German army and its allies in the Stalingrad area, saying that the Sixth Army sacrificed itself in Stalingrad, fought heroically, and gained immortal glory. The Romanian 20th Infantry Division and 1st Cavalry Division fought side by side with their German comrades to the end and also shared in the glory. At the same time, the German army continued to defend against Soviet attacks in several areas of the southern front, and the German counter-offensive between the Chmani hub and the Don River, although met with strong Soviet resistance, finally reached its goal. Enemy offensives against the southern side of the German army in the Don and Donets River regions were all repulsed, and the German army has consolidated its positions. The fighting in western Caucasus was hindered by rain. The Soviet offensive in the Kuban area was jointly repulsed by the German and Slovak armies. The Soviet army's continuous attacks south of Lake Ladoga, day and night, were also repulsed.</p>
<h3>Caucasus Battle Moves to Kuban Area German Army Smoothly Conducts Avoidance War</h3>
<p>Switzerland, Jingyu, 24th, Havas News Agency Telegram. According to Axis sources, the situation on the Eastern Front is still unabated, with the focus shifting to the southern route. A summary of the situation on each route is as follows: (1) The German army in northern Caucasus smoothly conducted a circumvention battle yesterday, moving the battle to the Kuban Basin. The Red Army was unable to prevent the German army from reorganizing its forces. (2) North of the plain along the Manych River, the German army counterattacked, and the Red Army retreated eastward, losing 23 tanks. (3) The Red Army in the Rostov area gained nothing. Repeated attempts to land were repulsed. (4) A German team in the Stalingrad area is still fighting to the death, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. The Red Army once broke through the German line last night, but the entire defense line remained intact, and fierce fighting is still going on. (5) Since November 20th of last year, the Axis forces have destroyed 6,200 Soviet tanks between the Don and Volga rivers. (6) The Don area is still the center of the battle, and the war is currently being fought west of the river. The German-Hungarian Allied Forces in the middle reaches of the Don River counterattacked and achieved local victories. (7) A Red Army team south of Voronezh was surrounded. (8) From Voronezh north to the Arctic coast, there was almost no fighting yesterday. According to sources from Rome, Italian mountain troops are holding the front line on the Eastern Front, assisting the German army in operations in the Caucasus and Don River regions. A commentator on Rome Radio claimed that the war is proceeding according to plan. In this situation, reserve troops are the most important factor. The Red Army is wasting manpower and resources by transferring all reserve troops to the war zone. In the Axis High Command, it is better to abandon certain areas than to suffer heavy damage, which would be detrimental to the future of the war. Soviet newspapers fully understand the German military strategy and have warned against being overly optimistic about the Red Army's offensive.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Shigemitsu Returned to Nanjing Yesterday, Made a Statement to Reporters</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th, Central News Agency Telegram. Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu went to Shanghai on the 19th of this month to hold important discussions with Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China, Commander Yoshida of the Chinese Fleet, and local Japanese agencies of the Army and Navy, as well as various agencies of third countries, to determine the political and economic policies to adapt to the new situation after our country's entry into the war. He has returned to Nanjing at 2:20 pm on the 25th after completing his mission. At 4 pm on the same day, Mr. Shigemitsu specially met with the press corps at the embassy and made a statement as follows: "My trip to Shanghai was partly to inspect the areas under my jurisdiction as the Ambassador to China, and to observe the actual situation in Shanghai, the most important center in China after China's entry into the war. In Shanghai, I met with Commander-in-Chief [blank] and Commander Yoshida of the Fleet and exchanged opinions with each other. As a result, we unanimously advocated that in order to adapt to the central government's promotion of strong policies, the local branch agencies, the Army, the Navy, and the Greater East Asia Ministry should also cooperate in unity. In terms of the situation in Shanghai, all aspects of the Japanese side can cooperate in unity to adapt to the new situation and follow the central government's policy. I am very pleased with this enthusiasm. I also met directly with representatives from various sectors of the private sector and listened to their opinions. All parties can fully understand this policy. During my stay in Shanghai, I had many in-depth opportunities for talks with the Chinese side. Also, at the inaugural meeting of the Diplomatic Promotion Association, well-known figures in Shanghai's diplomatic circles attended and expressed their strong determination to cooperate in developing China's future diplomatic relations. I am very pleased with this point. Chinese people of insight understand the meaning of participating in the war and understand Japan's true intentions, believing that since China is now an ally of Japan and stands on the common front, the path that China should take is very clear. Policies consistent with Japan are to actively implement the common purpose of prosecuting the war. This tendency will become more intense and urgently needed in the future. After the transformation of Japan's policy toward China and China's participation in the war, various situations may change. This change is progressive. China and Japan, standing on the common front, must have a long-term vision and act cautiously in order to achieve the common goal of the Greater East Asia War. Once a decision is made, it must be quickly and actively implemented. Japan will quickly put into practice what it once vowed to do. Regarding the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the various matters in the treaties concluded between Japan and China are currently underway. I think they will be concretized soon."</p>
<h3>War Results of Japanese Army in the Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi Border Region</h3>
<p>Shijiazhuang, 25th, Allied Press Telegram. It was disclosed here today that the elite Japanese troops have launched a mopping-up campaign against the 8,000 Communist troops of the Eighth Route Army in the Taihang Mountains of the Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi Border Region since Thursday, eliminating 1,000 Communist troops and are currently pursuing them. Several other Japanese teams in the area have surrounded 1,200 Communist troops and are currently intensifying their encirclement and annihilation.</p>
<h3>Northwest of Yingcheng, Chongqing Army Crushed</h3>
<p>Hankou, 25th, Central News Agency Telegram. The 45th Division of the 22nd Army Group of Chongqing was completely crushed in the northwest of Yingcheng (northwest of Hankou) due to the attack of the Japanese army. After investigation, the corpses of 1,140 Chongqing soldiers and 172 prisoners were found. The Japanese army seized 10 heavy and light machine guns and many other military supplies.</p>
<h3>Governor Chen of Guangdong Announced His Inauguration</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 25th, Central News Agency Telegram. Since the National Government announced the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, in order to adapt to the wartime system, this province has been specially appointed by the National Government to appoint Chen Yaozu as the Governor of Guangdong Province. After Mr. Chen received the appointment from the Central Government, he specially announced his inauguration at the joint weekly meeting of the Provincial Government and the Pacification Headquarters at 10 am today. All officials above the rank of recommendation of the military and political agencies in the province attended the meeting. The Governor then announced his inauguration and gave instructions to his subordinates. The meeting ended at 11 am after the instructions were completed.</p>
<h3>People of Suhuai Donate Money and Offer Aircraft</h3>
<p>Xuzhou, 24th, Central News Agency Telegram. The people of Suhuai have been donating money to offer aircraft for days, and the donations have exceeded 50,000 yuan.

<h3>Fierce Battles in Tunisia All Day Axis Forces Make Progress Both Sides Fight to Death for Strategic Heights US Troops Reinforce from Algeria</h3>
<p>Switzerland, Jingcheng, 24th, Havas News Agency Telegram. Fierce battles raged all day yesterday on the Tunisian front. According to German sources, Axis forces made progress in El Mansourah and Funduq al-Alalib. A team of US troops was surrounded in the mountains. Italian forces have sent troops to reinforce from Algeria. Also, according to the Italian official war report, Axis forces are currently building new positions, and the Air Force is also bombing Allied lines. According to the Allied Command war report, the German army is currently advancing towards Djebel Djaffap. Fierce fighting is raging between the two sides for the heights between Ban Zhubridge and Kairouan. French separatist forces were also forced to retreat in the Os利亚 Valley. According to the command of the French separatist forces in the port of Algiers, the Axis paratroopers who landed in the French defense zone have been resolved after fierce fighting. According to Rome's announcement, the armored units of the Axis forces in Tripolitania have already established new defense lines. Currently, only small-scale rearguard battles are taking place between Rommel's army and the British army. In addition, British and American aircraft bombed the airfields on Sicily, causing minor casualties among residents. A US destroyer was also sunk by us in the western sea of Algiers. Lisbon, 25th, Allied Press Telegram. According to news from North Africa received here, the battle in central Tunisia has become more intense in recent days. The Axis forces used mobile tactics and suddenly launched an offensive, crushing the resistance of the French rebels in the Osertia Creek Valley northwest of Kairouan. On the 23rd, they captured the strategic height of Djebel Djaffap in the southeast of the valley, suppressing the important road from Kairouan to Osertia, and pursuing the anti-Axis forces retreating to the west of the valley. They are currently advancing with all their strength. The anti-Axis command also admitted that the French rebels had retreated, and said that Djebel Djaffap had fallen into the hands of the Axis forces, so the French army had to retreat to Djebel Ousslat. It is generally believed that Axis Commander General Fin Anim will expand the stronghold in the Kairouan area to the north and south and strengthen the offensive taken north of Pengdevass. Therefore, the French rebels on the eastern side of the Atlas Mountains will soon be annihilated. The anti-Axis forces are deeply disturbed and have transferred the US 2nd Mechanized Division and 3rd Infantry Division from Teba萨方面 in Morocco to reinforce the Tunisian troops.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th, Allied Press Telegram. On the night of the 23rd, the German Air Force, with a large formation of heavy bombers and escorted by fighter planes, attacked the anti-Axis transport base in Algiers, the port of Bona. At that time, they braved fierce artillery fire and bombed fiercely for 30 minutes, completely destroying the port facilities. At the same time, several places in the city caught fire and burned. Another formation of the German Air Force raided the anti-Axis airfields in Tunisia and Algeria.</p>
<h3>Significance of Rommel's Army Retreat British Eighth Army Loses More Than It Gains</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th, Allied Press Telegram. The German authorities explained the significance of Rommel's army's retreat operation on the 24th, saying that the movement of the German-Italian army west of Tripoli was not hindered by the British army in any way, and all movements were carried out smoothly according to plan. The British Eighth Army's work in the past three months has clearly attempted to encircle Rommel's army from the side, but today it has not only completely failed, but has also suffered heavy losses. In reality, although British Eighth Army Commander Montgomery is far superior to the Axis forces in terms of troop strength and modern weapons, he has still failed to drive out the Axis mechanized forces in North Africa, but has instead wasted combat power. Moreover, in the battles of recent days, the British side, especially a part of the southern wing, has suffered heavy damage to its weapons and troop strength. All of this is sufficient to prove that the combat power of Zamel's army has not been reduced in the slightest. The British operation has shown that it has failed, and the British army has never received supplies from the sea. In addition, the port facilities of Tripoli have been completely destroyed by the Axis forces, so the port is of no benefit to the supply of a large number of mechanized troops. Therefore, the Montgomery army will have to rely on the difficult land transport route in the future. This route is long and has many weaknesses and has been repeatedly bombed by the Axis air force in the past.</p>
<h3>The Position of Commander of the US Army in North Africa Rumored to be Succeeded by Marshall</h3>
<p>Soviet Union, 25th, Allied Press Telegram. Since the establishment of the French North African regime, British Commander Eisenhower has been dictatorial, and the Chief Secretary of Politics Marie has also lacked flexibility, which has aroused criticism from both British and American political circles. According to a Washington special correspondent report in the London Chronicle, it is rumored that Eisenhower has recently resigned, and the vacancy has been appointed to General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the US Army. However, this statement has not been confirmed, but it has caused great repercussions in British political circles. Sweden, Jingcheng, 25th, Haitong News Agency Telegram. A special correspondent from a Swedish newspaper stationed in London reported that after learning that General Rommel's troops in North Africa had crossed the Tunisian border and occupied the Mareth Line, he was extremely disappointed. The British plan to prevent the German army from reaching Tunisia has now completely failed, and it will take time to reorganize General Montgomery's troops, so it will not be possible to launch an offensive against the Mareth Line in a hurry. Also, the British Eighth Army and the First Army may launch an offensive against the Mareth Line at the same time, but the First Army is making slow progress and may not be able to launch a major offensive early.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt and Churchill Discuss Unifying the United Front and Will Convene a Meeting of the Four Great Powers Important Announcements Will Be Made Soon</h3>
<p>Sweden, Jingcheng, 25th, Allied Press Telegram. According to a Washington dispatch, US Secretary of State Hull told the press corps on the 23rd that US Ambassador to Britain Winant and British European Fleet Commander Stark were in Washington. He also hinted that Britain and the United States are currently holding major discussions on unifying the anti-Axis front. Therefore, it is generally believed that the British and American governments will issue a statement as soon as the discussions come to an end, clarifying the anti-Axis policies in operations and politics. Washington's diplomatic circles believe that the important topics of the agreement will be: (1) Regarding the organization of a four-nation conference by representatives of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing to serve as the highest anti-Axis agency; (2) Resolving the Anglo-American disputes over the French North African regime; (3) Opening a second war front in Europe and the Pacific War; (4) Countermeasures to deal with the Axis trade disruption war. It is expected that the results of this agreement will have an impact on the anti-Axis war policy in the future.</p>
<p>Sweden, 15th, Allied Press Telegram. According to a report by the British government, the British and American governments are holding extremely important negotiations in Washington, and official reports may be available soon. Although the content is unknown, it is believed that the political situation in French North Africa and the organization of a four-power meeting of Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, and Chiang Kai-shek are both under discussion. As for the saying that Churchill has arrived in Washington, it originated in London. During the meeting of the British House of Commons last week, Churchill was absent, and Deputy Prime Minister Adler reported on the war situation on his behalf. The outside world therefore speculated that Churchill had gone to the United States.</p>
<h3>Striving to Break the Deadlock in the North African Political Problem</h3>
<p>Switzerland, Jingcheng, 24th, Havas Telegram. According to sources in London, the British and American sides may take new solutions to the North African political problem in order to break the deadlock. London has been constantly rumored that Prime Minister Churchill and US President Roosevelt decided to entrust General Baudru to preside over North African military and political affairs after a long talk. Mr. Jia was the former High Commissioner of France in Syria and Lebanon, and once served as the Governor of Vietnam. After participating in the 特戈尔派 分裂运动, he made great efforts in the attack on Syria and was appointed as the private representative of 特戈阐 in the Near East. In informed sources, it is said that Prime Minister Churchill's consultations in Washington have resulted in a solution that is difficult to solve the difficulties encountered by Britain in North Africa. For two and a half years, Jia Delu has been in collusion with 特戈尔. If he comes forward to deal with the North African political situation, it can be accepted by 特戈尔. However, it is questionable whether it will be accepted by the Inspector General of Morocco, Noguès, the Director General of French West Africa, Boisson, and General Jilao, because the former two usually despise Jia Delu's behavior, and Jilao may also have difficulties in giving up military power in North Africa.</p>
<h3>Australia's Prime Minister Curtin to Broadcast Today: Parliament to Convene Amidst Political Instability</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Allied News) - According to a cable from Canberra, the Australian government has announced that Prime Minister Curtin is scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech on the 26th. It is also reported that in addition to being broadcast nationwide by Australian radio stations, both the United Kingdom and the United States are also planning to rebroadcast it. It is widely expected that Curtin will address the current situation of the war in the Southwest Pacific, as well as issues related to Australia's current human resources, the deployment of Australian troops overseas, and American aid. Currently, with Parliament not yet in session, the Australian political situation is quite unstable. The Labor Party has deep-seated opposition to the deployment of Australian troops overseas, leading to widespread rumors of a cabinet crisis. It is believed that Curtin's speech is intended to address Parliament under these circumstances. At the same time, the evolution of the war situation in the Southwest Pacific has made Australia's position increasingly precarious. Recently, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt delivered a speech strongly emphasizing Australia's crisis, and Minister for Shipping Beasley followed on the 24th, warning Australians that Australia's position has not improved. All of this demonstrates that senior Australian government officials are deeply concerned about a Japanese invasion of Australia. It is anticipated that Curtin will use this speech to point out the importance of the Pacific war situation and request that the United States strengthen its aid to Australia.</p>
<h3>Confirmation of the Sinking of the British Aircraft Carrier "Revenge"</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 25th (Havas) - According to news from London, the British Admiralty has announced that the British aircraft carrier "Revenge" has sunk off the coast of North Africa, with a total of 507 personnel killed.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to a cable from London, the British Admiralty announced yesterday that the submarine "Tra La" has not returned to its base beyond the expected timeframe, and it is presumed that it may have been sunk.</p>
<h3>India-Burma Border</h3>
<p>— Kodama</p>
<p>Translation from Tokyo Asahi Shimbun</p>
<p>(Dispatch from Kodama, Special Correspondent of Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, from the Arakan Mountains on the India-Burma border, 6th) - The Arakan Mountains are located at the intersection of the India-Burma border. Sparsely populated, it is a wilderness where tigers, lions, elephants, leopards, and other wild beasts roam, with many mysterious stories passed down. The terrain is strategic, forming a natural defensive line in the western part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This reporter served as a war correspondent last winter...</p>
<p>I ventured deep into the Arakan Mountains, visiting the brave guards stationed there who look down on western India from the mountains. The jungle is dense, with the roars of tigers and the cries of monkeys capable of terrifying the soul. My visit coincided with the eve of the Lunar New Year, and the next morning, we celebrated New Year's Day together there.</p>
<p>Herds of Wild Monkeys in the Jungle</p>
<p>After crossing the Irrawaddy River, many Arakan tribesmen greeted us, welcoming our entry. Around 4 PM, we ventured further into the mountain road, flanked by towering jungles, with herds of wild monkeys jumping and frolicking in the trees. That night, we stayed in a mountain hut, and the brave guards stationed there welcomed the visitors from their distant homeland. They specially prepared roasted peacock meat as a treat, which was delicious. The next day, we followed a narrow path, which was treacherous. The Arakan Mountains stood majestically, a truly magnificent sight. The sun was scorching, and the heat of the day caused headaches, while the evenings were chilling.</p>
<p>Piles of White Bones at the Foot of the Mountains</p>
<p>There were many遗骸 and piles of white bones buried at the foot of the mountain. In the past, due to the British government's disregard for the people's livelihoods, it issued a forced evacuation order. Indian civilians, with Burma as their only escape route, climbed the treacherous Arakan Mountains, retreating through this area. Since February of last year, as many as tens of thousands of people have passed through. On average, fewer than 20,000 out of every 100,000 returned to India, with 80,000 dying of starvation, thirst, heatstroke, or being killed by wild animals. Therefore, the mountainside is filled with piles of white bones, a truly tragic scene!</p>
<p>Even under the clear sky of daylight, one could feel a chilling atmosphere. It is said that after dark, fires must be lit around the huts to scare away wild animals, as tigers tend to appear.</p>
<p>The Indian Ocean Clearly Visible</p>
<p>The mountain range stretches endlessly. Around noon, standing on a high peak, we could see a vast expanse of white, resembling the edge of the sky, which was the Indian Ocean. In the evening, we stayed in the tent of Captain Kawano of the Mustard Unit. Around 3 AM, the sounds of birds and monkeys were extremely loud, making the Arakan night very lively. Shortly after, a tiger roared, and the sounds of birds and monkeys immediately ceased. The tiger's roar was long and spine-chilling. On New Year's Day, the weather was even colder, and despite wearing multiple layers of clothing, the chill was still piercing. As the sun rose, all the brave soldiers bowed towards the east, welcoming the new year, feeling greatly excited.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Guarding the India-Burma Border</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Active Everywhere: Attacks on Chittagong and the Solomon Islands, British Aircraft Blindly Bomb Rangoon, Burmese People Indignant</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Allied News) - According to news from Washington, the US Navy recently announced that after Japanese aircraft attacked US military positions in the Solomon Islands area the previous night, they returned to bomb them three times yesterday.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Allied News) - According to news from Melbourne, General Macworth’s headquarters recently acknowledged that Japanese aircraft attacked Milne Bay and Port Moresby on Saturday night, and the port facilities in both locations were severely damaged.</p>
<p>From a Certain Japanese Air Base, 25th (Allied News) - It was disclosed here today that Japanese army aircraft attacked Chittagong and Feni in India on Friday and Saturday, inflicting heavy damage on military facilities. On Friday night, during the attack on Chittagong, bombers used the bright moonlight to concentrate their bombs on port facilities, causing a fire in one area. On the same night, another unit of Japanese aircraft attacked the Feni airfield, causing fires in four locations. All aircraft from both units safely returned to their bases. During the second attack on Chittagong, Japanese bombers, protected by fighters, braved intense anti-aircraft fire to bomb oil tanks, docks, train stations, and other military targets, causing six fires.

Japanese forces immediately responded with heavy anti-aircraft fire, and Japanese fighters also took off to intercept them, shooting down two enemy aircraft in a short time, which fell into the Bay of Bengal. The victims of this air raid were mostly hospitals, mosques, and ordinary residences, so the Burmese people expressed considerable indignation at the British bombing.</p>

<h3>Exchange of Notes Between Japan and Vietnam: Contents Announced, Future Settlements Between Japan and Vietnam to be Based on Special Yen</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government's official gazette officially published today the documents regarding the settlement methods between Japan and Vietnam. The contents are divided into seven items, first stating that future settlements between Japan and Vietnam will be based on the special yen. Previously, the settlement methods between Japan and Vietnam were divided into three categories: (1) trade settlements, (2) non-trade settlements, and (3) military expenses. Among these, the first and second categories were settled in gold or foreign currencies, i.e., in free yen, while the third category of military expenses used special yen. However, according to the exchanged documents, future settlements between Japan and Vietnam, whether for trade, non-trade, or military expenses, will all be based on the special yen. This method of settlement in special yen will apply not only between Japan and Vietnam but also between Japanese-occupied territories and Vietnam, as well as between areas currently using the yen settlement system and Vietnam. As for the exchange rate between the special yen and the Vietnamese currency, according to the documents, it will be based on the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the Vietnamese currency on January 1, 1943, i.e., 100 Vietnamese currency units are equivalent to 97.60 Japanese yen (with a buying and selling difference of 50 sen). This exchange rate will not be changed unless a revised agreement is reached between Japan and Vietnam. The effective period of the exchanged documents is indefinite from January 1st of this year, i.e., it will remain in effect until a termination agreement is reached between Japan and Vietnam. After the exchange of documents, if any of the contents conflict with the content of the Japan-Vietnam Economic Agreement concluded on May 3, 1941, the terms of the exchanged documents will supersede them. The special yen is distinct from the free yen, i.e., the special yen is a currency used for settlements within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and is in principle not convertible into ordinary currency. Vietnam will be able to use the special yen obtained through this settlement method for trade settlements with various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>

(4) "War propaganda and youth training": county magistrates should convene meetings of district chiefs, township chiefs, and baojia chiefs to report on the significance of the National Government's entry into the war, which is one method of propaganda. The provincial capital is already actively organizing training for youth, and various counties should train quickly. We should earnestly achieve the above four points.

<h3>A Corrupt Township Head Embezzles Nearly 20,000 Yuan in Public Funds and Remains Unpunished</h3>
<p>The phenomenon of political corruption in the interior is endless, and we do not need to do much to expose it. Even the position of a township head takes advantage of the convenience of the office, exploits the villagers, and embezzles public funds. Once reported, they can still live freely, unpunished by law. It is truly disheartening. Below is a bitter and indignant text from a farmer named Hui Li from Cili, Xiangxi, which can also reflect the phenomenon of political corruption.</p>
<p>"Our township is a small and poor township located in the remote Cili, Xiangxi. Last year, due to the impact of the drought, the autumn harvest was disappointing. Since winter and spring, most civilians, except for a few who can eat mixed grains, have been gathering wild quinoa and ferns from the mountains to fill their stomachs. The government launched the National Construction Savings, National Salvation Bonds, and One Yuan Donation for Aircraft fundraising campaigns, strictly ordering apportionments. The poor people all tighten their belts, even suffering hunger and cold, and all pay according to the assigned quotas, which are handed over by the bao chiefs to the township head. Who would have known that our township head was born with a "suede leather throat" (local saying, meaning immune to accountability). He received 5,450 yuan in National Construction Savings from the entire township, and he embezzled 3,390 yuan. He received 4,154 yuan in National Salvation Bonds, and he embezzled 2,123.60 yuan. He received 21,270 yuan in One Yuan Donation for Aircraft, and he embezzled 4,579 yuan. This is not all. He also took the opportunity to build and repair the township warehouse, using 64 dan of accumulated grains. He also received 1,653.12 yuan in government funding for warehouse construction and arbitrarily fined 1,173 yuan. After deducting expenses for wood, labor, miscellaneous items, etc., he embezzled 7,463.52 yuan. The government purchased military grains from the people and issued supplementary prices of 3,936 yuan, and he also embezzled 1,722 yuan. Just these few items alone amount to a total embezzlement of 19,278.12 yuan. This aroused the indignation of all the people in our township, and we immediately listed the embezzled amounts by category and requested the county government to investigate. The county government immediately sent two clerks to the township office, convened the bao chiefs of each bao, and the township head had already rushed to receive training. The account books were found in the township head's home, and the amount of various payments paid by each bao chief were checked and reconciled one by one. The carpenters and handlers who built the warehouse were also summoned to inquire about the actual warehouse construction expenses, which were not much different from the amounts reported by our people. The township head's family became anxious and offered heavy bribes to ask the two clerks to intercede, but the two clerks still had a conscience and refused to accept them. However, there are still a few points that our ordinary people cannot understand: (1) According to recent reports, a county magistrate in a certain county in Yunnan was officially tied to the execution ground for embezzling public funds and shot. In the past, when Xue Yue first arrived, he also shot a tax bureau chief for embezzling 500 yuan. Why is it that our township head, who embezzled public funds, which has been verified by the county government to be more than 19,000 yuan, can now safely receive training in Laiyang? (2) It cannot be said that the current political institutions lack anything in terms of organization. For example, to supervise township administration, guidance officers are sent to supervise at any time. For example, the township office has an economic section that is specifically responsible for economic matters. Why is it that our township head embezzled so much public funds and it was still necessary for the people to report it before it could be known? The account books of our township office for the collection of payments are not in the economic section but in the township head's home. I wonder if other townships are like this?"! (Sent by Hui Li from December 20, 1942)</p>

<h3>French Concession Re-investigates Household Registration; Each Household Must Re-Fill Joint Guarantee Forms; Number of People and Ages Must Be Accurately Recorded; Photo of Head of Household Should Be Affixed to Household Registration Certificate</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities, considering that the joint guarantee forms for household registration within the concession have become inaccurate due to personnel changes since this year, have decided to re-investigate household registration starting immediately. Each household must re-fill the joint guarantee forms, and must fill them out item by item according to the most accurate current situation. If there is any intentional concealment or false reporting, severe penalties will be imposed upon discovery. The joint guarantee offices in each district have received orders from their respective police stations to comply and implement this. Regarding the filling out of the joint guarantee forms, in addition to filling in the items stipulated on the form, the following items must be noted: (1) The number of people must not be inflated or underreported when filling out the household registration joint guarantee form; (2) The residence permit number should be indicated in the remarks column, and those who have not received it should indicate "applying"; (3) The age should be filled in according to the age on the residence permit, and there should be no false information; (4) Each form should be filled out in triplicate, one to be submitted to the police station, one to the responsible joint guarantee, and one to be framed by the head of the household and hung in a conspicuous place; (5) A photo of the head of the household should be affixed to the back of the Baojia (collective security system) household registration certificate for verification when receiving rice purchase permits. If the head of the household is unable to collect it in person and wants someone else to collect it on their behalf, a photo of the representative should also be affixed. After all photos are affixed, they should be sent to the responsible joint guarantee office for official stamping and certification.</p>
<h3>Cooperative Prepares to Sell Sugar; Different Methods in Southern City and Concessions; Civil Servants Request Issuance of Oil Purchase Certificates</h3>
<p>Sugar</p>
<p>The Sugar Merchants Cooperative, in order to maintain the sugar rationing system in Shanghai, has already prepared for the fourth phase of sugar distribution. (1) In the southern city area, a trial implementation of per capita distribution based on the Baojia system will be conducted, stipulating a certain amount of sugar to be distributed per person, sold upon presentation of a purchase certificate. The distribution amount and price will be officially announced by the cooperative at that time. As for the re-registration of retailers, it is being rushed. Once the trial implementation in the southern city is effective, it will be implemented throughout the city. (2) Sugar sales in the Public Concession, French Concession, and Hongkou will be handled in the fourth phase according to the new method implemented on January 23, that is, sold upon presentation of property tax receipts. Retailers are scheduled to sell sugar on alternate single and double days. Retailers first collect tax receipts and give receipts to consumers, then submit the tax receipts to the cooperative for review. After the review is approved, the tax receipts are returned, and on the fourth day, sugar is sold upon presentation of the receipts, and the property tax receipts are returned.</p>
<p>Oil</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Edible Oil Traders Wholesale Office purchased 20,000 dan (a unit of dry measure) of edible oil from the military authorities and distributed it to 1,830 retail edible oil stores in the city this month, divided into Group A and Group B, the second phase of edible oil stores in Group A and Group B has been fully distributed one after another. The date for the third phase of oil sales for Group A and Group B is still difficult to determine. However, the Edible Oil Wholesale Office has been convening board meetings to discuss methods and request the authorities to quickly distribute oil to meet the needs of the year-end. As for the office's past distribution of edible oil to civil servants of various agencies, it suddenly stopped distributing oil a few days ago, resulting in the inability of ordinary civil servants to purchase edible oil. It is now known that civil servant groups from various agencies are preparing to negotiate with the office, requesting the rapid issuance of special oil purchase certificates.</p>

<p>Ad Valorem Tax Implemented Starting Today</p>
<p>The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, in order to adjust the tax system, has abolished the special cigarette tax and changed the unified cigarette tax to ad valorem taxation, still dividing it into five levels of taxation. The date for starting the new tax system was originally scheduled for the 20th of this month. However, the Sino-Japanese tobacco manufacturers in this city requested a postponement because of the sudden change in tax by the department, which caused many practical difficulties. It is now known that the Taxation Department, after receiving the request, considered the reasons stated to be factual and has transferred the request to the Ministry of Finance for approval, postponing the implementation until today (the 26th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Marquis of the House of Peers Visits Special Prison No. 2</h3>
<p>Mr. Shijo Takauta, Marquis of the Japanese House of Peers, and Mr. Kono Takeshide, who recently arrived in Shanghai from Japan, drove to the Second Special District Prison on Masnan Road in the French Concession yesterday morning for a visit. Huang Yaqiang, the warden of the prison, personally received them and accompanied them on a tour of the prison's interior. The two gentlemen inquired in detail about the motives for the crimes of all the prisoners, and did not leave until noon, it is said.</p>
<h3>Preserving Wealth (5)</h3>
<p>— Nie Yuntai</p>
<p>The Amitayurdhyana Sutra also says that those who wish to be reborn in the Pure Land must cultivate the Three Blessings. All sutras explain that to attain Buddhahood, one must first deliver sentient beings. Because the Dharma takes great compassion as its foundation, without great compassion, everything is false. Although one eats vegetarian food and recites the Buddha's name, when one's life comes to an end, one's karma is too heavy, and the Bodhisattvas do not appear, but the demon soldiers come forward. At that time, one's mindfulness of the Buddha is completely lost, and the retribution for what one has done out of greed, anger, and delusion in ordinary times will mature, and one will still fall into the realms of hungry ghosts, animals, and hells. It will be too late to regret it. I see that in recent society, there are many people who consider themselves Buddhists, but most of them do not understand the principles of Buddhism. They have millions or tens of millions of assets, but they reluctantly do a few thousand yuan worth of good deeds, and then think that they have already done merit. That is why I am explaining this passage in detail, "hoping that they will awaken." Furthermore, Tolstoy of Russia said: "People in today's society take in millions of yuan with their left hand and give one or two yuan with their right hand, and then call themselves great philanthropists." It can be seen that this kind of behavior is a common problem in the world. Ordinary people cannot escape sin, so how can Buddhists escape sin?</p>
<p>I will briefly conclude the above text and list the points below:</p>
<p>(1) In the past few decades, all the rich people I have seen have had their descendants decline.</p>
<p>(2) In the past sixty years, all the families of great civil and military officials have declined, and their descendants have not prospered.</p>
<p>(3) Only a few great officials who were unwilling to get rich have descendants who can still study and make progress.</p>
<p>(4) Officials who are extremely high-ranking and have many opportunities to get rich, but are unwilling to get rich and are always thinking about helping the people, have the most prosperous and lasting descendants, and there are historical facts to prove it.</p>
<p>(5) In Shanghai, there are several examples of families with tens of millions, tens of millions, or hundreds of millions of dollars that suddenly went bankrupt. All of these families were unwilling to do charitable deeds to help others.</p>
<p>(6) Wealthy families only care about their own extravagance and enjoyment, accumulating money to leave to their descendants. When they see famine, they are unwilling to donate large sums of money to help disaster victims, which is no different from committing murder and will be subject to moral condemnation and the dominion of karmic retribution.</p>
<p>(7) The Buddha-dharma and heavenly principles are in everyone's heart. When everyone is grateful to someone, heaven is happy. When everyone is angry about something, heaven is angry. An ancient saying goes: "If a thousand people point their fingers at you, you will die without illness." The Book of Documents says, "Heaven sees as the people see, and heaven hears as the people hear." The Avatamsaka Sutra says: "If one causes sentient beings to rejoice, then one causes all Tathagatas to rejoice." Therefore, if you want to gain blessings, you must create more blessings for others, otherwise the Buddhas and heavens cannot help you.</p>
<p>(8) Wealthy people seek gods and worship Buddhas, burn incense and recite scriptures, but if they do not arouse great compassion and give up wealth to help others, their merits will be small and their sins will be great, and they will be difficult to escape evil retribution.</p>

<h3>25th Installment of Household Ration Rice; Purchase Order Quantity Remains Unchanged; Only Five Days for Sale</h3>
<p>In order to regulate the people's food supply and control grain, the Public Works Department, after monopolizing the purchase of major food grains in the producing areas, has implemented a distribution system. Regarding the 25th installment of household ration rice sales date for Shanghai residents, it has been agreed that the period from February 1st to 7th will be set, of which the 5th and 6th will be the final period of closure, and sales will be stopped. The 8th is the last day of routine closure. Therefore, the actual sale dates for the next installment are only five days: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 7th. The 26th installment is from February 9th to 17th, and the 18th is the routine closure. The 27th installment is from February 19th to 27th, and the 28th is the routine closure. From March onwards, the old system of ten days per installment will be restored. As for the next installment of household ration rice, various contracted rice shops have begun to receive purchase orders. The allocation amount of white rice and flour listed on the rice purchase order is still the same as the previous installment. The prices are: (1) White rice per bag (one picul and two and a half dou) is 300 yuan plus 4 jiao (a unit of currency); (2) Flour per bag is 92 yuan. Therefore, the amount of grain distributed in that installment is still two sheng of white rice and one jin and twelve liang of flour, and the price should also remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>National Diplomacy and Participation in the War; Wu Kaisheng's Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Kaisheng, at the invitation of the Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association on the evening of October 24, broadcast a speech on Shanghai Radio on the question of national diplomacy and participation in the war, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>The government's declaration of war is by no means an empty decoration, but a manifestation of the government and the people's morally consistent awakening. The government authorities are doing their best to make the political, military, economic, and cultural aspects adapt to the wartime system. In addition to this, it is necessary to awaken the people and promote an independent and innovative diplomacy. Otherwise, no matter how hard the government authorities work, the result will inevitably be half the effort for twice the result, or even become mere paper talk.</p>
<p>The so-called national diplomacy is to mobilize the national people - including the people's will and power - to be the backing and vanguard of national diplomacy. In other words, it is to stand in the position of the people, fulfill the responsibilities of the people, coordinate with the government, contribute everything, and strive for diplomacy. In short, it means "the people have the right to diplomacy." Of course, "national diplomacy" does not mean that the opinion of a part of the people purely represents the diplomatic policy of a country, nor does it mean that the diplomatic policy of the government is controlled or interfered with according to the private opinions of the general public. The most reasonable thing is that the government authorities determine a proper diplomatic line, and then encourage all the people to move forward along this new path.</p>
<p>The meaning of national diplomacy has been explained clearly, and then a brief review of the relationship between participation in the war and its various aspects is made.</p>
<p>Since our government entered a state of war, it should do its best to promote the sudden awakening of the people's diplomatic consciousness, mobilize the human and material resources of the whole country, contribute everything, sacrifice everything, fight shoulder to shoulder with the people of friendly countries, share weal and woe, and cooperate to advance, in order to achieve the early completion of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, the authorities of friendly countries should also understand the sincerity and spirit of sacrifice of the Chinese people in cooperation, eliminate past suspicions and prejudices, establish a sympathetic psychology, and treat each other frankly and accept each other's friendly diplomacy. Furthermore, they should treat each other equally with reciprocal treatment. This can be said to be a kind of "moral assistance" from the Chinese people to friendly countries after participating in the war. The purpose of the establishment of the National Diplomacy Promotion Association lies in the realization of this ideal.</p>
<p>The authorities' advocacy of national diplomacy is the first sign of respecting the status of the people and valuing public opinion. After participating in the war, it is of course impossible to ignore the point of harmonizing the feelings between China and Japan. Now, friendly countries have resolutely returned the concessions and abolished extraterritoriality, and Italy has also followed suit. Such a sincere expression is very touching to the government and people of our country. However, it is also hoped that the authorities will go a step further and minimize the time for the people to "share suffering" as much as possible, and quickly seek the expression of the fact of "sharing happiness." If the real life of the people can be stabilized, the psychology of the people will naturally improve. In this way, the feelings between the two peoples can be truly harmonious, and the cooperation between the two countries can also have real effect. This is the most important goal of promoting "national diplomacy," and it can also be said to be the most earnest expectation of the Chinese people after participating in the war.</p>
<p>The National Government resolutely participated in the war, indicating that the government has a 120,000-point determination to cooperate with Japan. With the spirit of "sharing life and death" and "sharing weal and woe," all Chinese people should support it. I believe that the Chinese people should change "sharing life and death" to "sharing death and life" and "sharing weal and woe" to "sharing woe and weal." First, have the determination to die, and seek life from death. First, have the spirit to endure hardship, in order to seek sweetness after hardship.</p>
<p>In order to seek the true liberation of the East Asian nations and the comprehensive and lasting peace of the world, China and Japan should be sincere, united as one, take national diplomacy as the prerequisite, implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, and unite the oppressed nations of East Asia to fight together. Finally, I hope that the people should encourage the members of this association to work hard to promote national diplomacy under the five major guidelines of independent innovation, promoting peace, eliminating evil forces, implementing the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and protecting overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Economic Police Special Training; Duty is to Enforce Price Limits and Eliminate the Black Market; Supervised by Deputy Chief Inspector Gojima</h3>
<p>The Economic Police, newly established this year by the Public Concession Police Department, specialize in enforcing price limits and eliminating black market activities. It is learned that special training will begin tomorrow. Once the training period is over, they will begin working. According to reports, the head of the Economic Police Department is Deputy Chief Inspector Gojima, and the organization has semi-independent status.</p>
<h3>Year-End Approaches; Fish Market Changes to Cash Transactions</h3>
<p>As the year-end approaches and the Shanghai market and industrial and commercial industries are tight on funds, the Fish Market Office of the Shanghai Frozen Fish Industry Association has resolved that all buyers holding transaction certificates will temporarily switch to cash transactions from today until February 6. The old system will be restored on February 7.</p>
<h3>Authorities Urgently Seek to Stabilize Prices; Strengthen Control of Goods Sources; Expand the Scope of Food Rationing and Adjust Supply; Trade Associations Undertake Major Central Work</h3>
<p>According to well-informed sources, the authorities of the two concessions, after controlling the prices of goods sold by manufacturers and wholesalers from yesterday, so that retail prices can also be stabilized, are now planning to further control the sources of goods in the city, especially the main foods. The purpose is to maintain the continuous supply of various major foods, and to expand the scope of the rationing system that has already been implemented for rice, bread, and flour to include various major foods. It is learned that the authorities are still considering this matter. Once implemented, trade associations will be the main key in the distribution structure.</p>
<p>Trade Associations Submit Lists</p>
<p>It is verified that the authorities in this city have been very strict in supervising major commodities, and have repeatedly issued regulations, urging all industries to comply. All trade associations of major commodities should compile a list of their members, stating the following items, and submit them to the competent authorities for verification: (1) Member number; (2) Name of buyer and seller; (3) Business location; (4) Type of major commodity being managed; (5) Date of approval of registration; (6) Registration number; (7) Must be filled out in detail, without any ambiguity or false reporting. Otherwise, the trade association will be subject to legal sanctions.</p>
<p>Wholesale Prices Reported for Record</p>
<p>As for members of each association who also engage in wholesale business, they should report the following items to their respective trade associations every ten days. After receiving the report, the association should record them by household at the end of the month and report them to the full management agency for record, including (1) Wholesale quantity, price, and name of the buyer's business; (2) Quantity sold and price, and name of the seller's business; (3) Accumulated quantity; (4) Storage location. The above points must be detailed and complete. Those who violate the above regulations will be fined up to 1,000 yuan. According to the new regulations promulgated by the authorities, wholesalers should copy the prices and cost calculations of goods sold on the 23rd of this month into a table and report them before February 10.</p>

<h3>Aili Garden Fire Yesterday Morning; Precious Antiques Suffered Heavy Damage; Main Residential Bungalow Reduced to Ashes</h3>
<p>This newspaper reported yesterday that a major fire occurred on Jing'an Temple Road in the early morning. According to an investigation by reporters, the location of the fire was the residential bungalow in Aili Garden (Hardoon Garden) at 1273 Jing'an Temple Road. The fire suddenly broke out at about 3:15 in the morning. The flames rose and spread very quickly. Although the fire brigade rushed to the scene and tried its best to put out the fire, it still burned for as long as four hours before it was extinguished. The main residential bungalow was reduced to ashes. The old residences adjacent to it also suffered heavy damage. In total, about a hundred wooden houses and bungalows were destroyed. Fortunately, the fire brigade isolated the fire, and several sections of houses in the east, west, and south were spared from the fire.</p>
<p>Losses of Millions Heard to Be Fully Insured</p>
<p>It is reported that a large number of jewelry, furs, antiques, and valuable furniture were stored in the destroyed residence, so the loss was extremely large. The exact amount is unknown, but it is estimated to be about several million yuan. However, it is fully insured and there is no worry about compensation. As for the Hardoon family members and servants living in the residence, about 200 people, they escaped properly and no one died in the fire. It is said that the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit in the female servants' bedroom in the residence.</p>
<p>Two Hundred Masters and Servants All Escaped Properly</p>
<p>Several of the Hardoon family's adopted daughters first discovered the fire and quickly sounded the alarm to wake everyone up to escape. The Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade's lookout saw the fire at 3:16 and quickly dispatched three fire trucks to the scene. When they arrived, the central buildings had already become a sea of fire, and the flames were spewing out in all directions and were unapproachable. They quickly summoned the Xinzha Fire Brigade to also dispatch three fire trucks to rush to the scene to cooperate in putting out the fire. The deputy director of the Public Concession Fire Department, Huajinsi Mu (likely a transliteration), personally went to the scene to direct the fire fighting. Because the important residence that caught fire was at the southern end of the garden, the fire source was far away at the Jing'an Temple outside the north wall of the garden. Therefore, firefighters had no choice but to draw water from the pool next to the residence and fight the flames. It was not until 5:00 in the morning that they were able to control the fire and extinguish it. It is estimated that the fire burned for about four hours. It is reported that there are more than 500 people living in Aili Garden, and about 200 of them live in the main residence that was destroyed.</p>
<h3>Increased Tuition and Crowded Applications: Insufficient Aid Funds Will Likely Cause Impoverished Students to Drop Out of School, a Situation That People From All Walks of Life Cannot Stand Idly By. Middle School Group Exam Time Tomorrow.</h3>
<p>The fourth annual *Shen Bao* Reader Scholarship for elementary school students screening test has concluded. The middle school group's screening test is scheduled for tomorrow (27th) morning from 9:30 to 11:30 AM for high school grades 1, 2, and 3. The junior high school grade 1 exam will be held from 1:30 to 3:00 PM, and the junior high school grades 2 and 3 exam will be held from 3:30 to 5:00 PM. The location is at the YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road. Examinees should bring pens and other necessary items and should not be late.</p>
<p>Elementary School Screening Results to be Announced at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The elementary school exam papers are currently being reviewed by male and female teachers from the YMCA. Staff members of the newspaper's scholarship committee are separately investigating the family circumstances of each student, hoping to complete the investigation and review work within this month. The date for the distribution of funds is scheduled to be announced at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Number of Students Seeking Aid Doubles Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>Approximately 2,000 middle school students are taking the exam. With the general increase in tuition fees at various schools and the impact of rising living expenses on impoverished students, their family circumstances have become even more difficult. Looking back at the previous scholarship, about eight out of ten applicants received assistance. The scholarship funds for this year have not increased compared to last year, while the number of students seeking assistance has more than doubled. Under these dual difficulties of increased applicants and increased tuition fees, the number of applicants who can receive assistance this year will likely be less than half. The educational opportunities for those students who do not receive assistance are on the verge of being cut off. This situation is something that people from all walks of life cannot stand idly by and it is what the *Shen Bao* Reader Scholarship Committee urgently hopes that people from all walks of life will promote the spirit of human mutual assistance and continue to donate.</p>
<p>Trend of Transferring Funds to Aid Education is Rising</p>
<p>The newspaper received two letters from donors yesterday: (1) transferring New Year's money to aid education, and (2) transferring gift money to aid education. Both are commendable, and it is hoped that all sectors of society will continue to respond and emulate them to help more students. The letters state: (1) "I used to teach at various middle schools and have personally experienced the pain of hidden poverty. My five children have also felt the suffering of dropping out of school. Now that I am in business, my family can live comfortably. Therefore, in the spirit of human mutual assistance and with the consent of my children, I will use the customary New Year's money to assist one impoverished elementary school student each. It is estimated that the tuition and miscellaneous fees for five students each semester will be about 600 yuan. I have specially signed a check for this amount. - Ni Xiaotong" (2) "We are all from the countryside and from the lower class. Due to our family circumstances in our youth, we received little education. To this day, we deeply feel the pain of being out of school. For several years, we have received the earnest guidance of our teacher Zhu Yiyun, which has enabled us to be self-reliant. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the death of our teacher's late father. We have sent 300 yuan as a small token of our respect. He has donated the funds to your newspaper and asked us to transfer our contribution to your organization to benefit society. His enthusiasm for public welfare is something we admire. Although the amount is small and cannot solve the problem, it is our small effort. We believe there are many enthusiastic people in all walks of life who will come together to make a difference, and the impoverished children will be grateful beyond measure. - Du Yulin, Qiu Zhenhua, Zhou Zaisheng, Yuan Hongyi"</p>
<p>A Public-Spirited Cloth Merchant Donates</p>
<p>Mr. Li Tian'er, a cloth merchant from Hebei residing in Shanghai, came to the newspaper and stated that he had been repeatedly reading Mr. Nie Yuntai's methods for preserving wealth and the difficult situation of crowded scholarship applications and financial difficulties as reported in the *Shen Bao*, and he was deeply moved. For the past three days, he has been unable to sleep peacefully. He generously entrusted 1,000 yuan to publish an advertisement, calling on all sectors of society to support the newspaper's scholarship program, quickly fill out the donation notification form, and requested that the notification form be enlarged and printed for easy filling. His enthusiasm is deeply appreciated. Instead of using 1,000 yuan to publish an advertisement, it is better to directly donate it to the scholarship fund. He has agreed. The donation notification form will be enlarged and printed as requested.</p>
<p>Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The scholarship funds received yesterday include: Ni Xiaotong 600 yuan, Mr. Zhu 300 yuan, Du Yulin, Zhou Zaisheng, Qiu Zhenhua, Yuan Hongyi (combined) 300 yuan, Mr. Huang, Wang Zhongheng 200 yuan each, Zheng Xiangquan, Zhou Weibin, Cheng Xiangsheng, Wang Wenbin, Xu Zhihe, Xu Shaohe, Liu Wenhai, Xu Ke, Hua Zubei, Zhang Xiangchi, 100 yuan each, Zhang Guanlun 60 yuan, Renwu Society Class B of Senior High School 56 yuan, Zhang Jinsheng 40 yuan, Chen Zhenxie 35 yuan, Wang Songji 30 yuan, Mr. Li, Dai Cangqi (as much as possible) 20 yuan each, Mr. Yu, Zhu, Cui Ping 10 yuan each, Lin Shiyi 5 yuan, totaling reserve certificates 2,896 yuan.

<p>Jingan Temple Scholarship Method</p>
<p>A letter from Abbot Dewu and Supervisor Miga of Jingan Temple in this city states that the newspaper's advocacy of assisting students and benefiting the impoverished is deeply admired. The temple has now established a Buddhist scholarship fund, tentatively setting four scholarships specifically to assist university students in their final year to complete their studies and avoid failing at the last hurdle. The methods are attached below. All student selection and payment procedures will be handled by your newspaper. Attached methods: (1) Scholarship quota: two final-year university students majoring in arts and philosophy, and one final-year student each majoring in agricultural science and medicine. Students majoring in philosophy should focus on the study of Indian philosophy and Chinese philosophy (emphasizing Song and Ming Dynasty Neo-Confucianism), and must write a thesis on the respective subject upon graduation to be preserved by the temple. (2) Application requirements: in addition to the above qualifications, applicants must believe in Buddhism, have no bad habits, have good character, and have excellent academic performance, as certified by the school. (3) Application procedure: apply to the *Shen Bao*, undergo examination and selection. (4) The scholarship includes tuition and miscellaneous fees. At the beginning of the semester, the payment slip should be submitted to the *Shen Bao* to receive the fees. The newspaper's scholarship committee decided at yesterday's meeting that this scholarship should be open for applications separately starting from the 28th. Students who meet the methods set by the temple and whose families are impoverished can apply. The application deadline is the end of the month, and the selection will be determined after another examination.</p>
<p>Various Schools Donate Free Scholarships</p>
<p>The newspaper has received letters from various schools donating free scholarships, showing their enthusiasm. Here are some excerpts: (1) Southeast Women's Junior High School: "Your newspaper's organization of the scholarship fund to benefit impoverished students is truly commendable. Our school has been engaged in education for many years and dares not lag behind in promoting education. However, due to the relocation from Jiangwan to Shanghai after the incident, we are experiencing financial constraints. Donating funds to support education is beyond our ability. We have specially set up five free scholarships in the second year of junior high school. We hope your newspaper will recommend students with excellent grades, and we will waive all tuition and miscellaneous fees to do our part." (2) Mingxin Business Accounting Tutorial School: "Our school is showing sympathy for the readers' scholarship fund movement sponsored by your newspaper, and has set up a total of ten free scholarships to show our support. Anyone who is interested in learning accounting, and has been verified by your newspaper as truly impoverished but with high aspirations and unable to afford education, should be asked to bring a letter of certification to complete the admission procedures. The free places for each subject are listed as follows: (University Group) Cost Accounting one place, 75 yuan, Elementary Accounting one place, 75 yuan, (Middle School Group) Accounting two places, 60 yuan each, Advanced Bookkeeping four places, 50 yuan each, Elementary Bookkeeping two places, 35 yuan each." (3) Wuguang Girls' Middle School: "Jiang Tingxian, a student in the third year of senior high school at our school, unfortunately passed away due to acute appendicitis. Jiang was kind and loving to others and diligent in her studies. It is regrettable that her studies were cut short. Her friends and classmates are all grieving. Her classmates have launched the Tingxian Scholarship Fund as a memorial. First, Jiang's parents generously donated 500 yuan, and the students donated a total of over 3,000 yuan. We have long admired your newspaper's management of student loans for impoverished students, which has achieved remarkable results. The Tingxian Scholarship Fund Committee has decided to request your newspaper to recruit 15 new first-year junior high school students starting this spring, and the Tingxian Scholarship Fund will be used to pay for their expenses." (4) Huashi Elementary School: "Our school was originally located in the Nanshi area and was founded 36 years ago. After the war, it moved to its current address (No. 16, Huanghe Road, Annakin Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession). We have always emphasized strict discipline in our teaching. This semester, we have been trusted by the Shandesh Society and enthusiastic educators to set up 150 student loans, designated to cultivate outstanding children from impoverished families. We have heard that the number of applicants for your newspaper's scholarship fund for elementary school students is crowded, the quota is limited, and there are insufficient allocations. Our school is willing to specially reserve ten remaining places each for grades five and six. Students can come to our school for free (excluding books) with your exam passing certificate."</p>

<h3>工部局上年度 重要行政槪述</h3>
<h3>Important Administrative Overview of the Municipal Council Last Year Implementing the Baojia System Training Citizens in Air Defense Levying Three New Taxes Establishing a Comprehensive Committee</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council released an overview of important administrative affairs for the year 1942:</p>
<p>Revaluation of Real Estate</p>
<p>In accordance with item 8 of the resolution passed by the foreign taxpayers' meeting on April 17, 1941, the Bureau revalued all real estate within the boundary for the purpose of collecting donations. The valuation matters were completed last year (1942). Regarding land tax, the Bureau, in view of the fact that the land within the boundary has not been revalued since 1933, decided in July of last year to re-estimate the land price in order to increase tax revenue. However, due to the current situation, the above two new valuations have been postponed for implementation. The Bureau issued a statement on December 24, formally stating this matter.</p>
<p>Joint Municipal Council Meeting</p>
<p>In August of last year, the municipal authorities of the city agreed to hold a joint municipal meeting once a month in order to enhance cooperation and jointly discuss all issues related to public welfare. Since August, there have been four meetings, and the results of the meetings have been satisfactory.</p>
<p>Special Police Force in West Shanghai</p>
<p>The establishment of the special police force in West Shanghai was based on the temporary agreement on police power in West Shanghai signed between the Bureau and the Municipal Government on February 16, 1940. This agreement was announced to be abolished on May 1 of last year. After that, the police power in the outer area of West Shanghai was taken over by the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Implementing the Baojia System</p>
<p>After the bomb throwing case in the Lao Zha District on the eve of the Lunar New Year last year, the Bureau immediately approved the implementation of the Baojia system, promoting close cooperation between citizens and police officers to effectively eliminate undesirable elements and prevent illegal activities. Detailed rules and regulations on the organization and powers of the Baojia were formulated and published in the Bureau's gazette on October 2.</p>
<p>Citizen Air Defense Training</p>
<p>The Bureau, in close cooperation with the Air Defense Command, took appropriate measures to prevent air raids and promulgated detailed rules for light control and air defense measures. Air defense exercises were held from time to time to train citizens on how to practically apply air defense measures.</p>
<p>Abolishing the Curfew</p>
<p>The curfew was announced to be abolished from September 16 of last year. From the same date, citizens should carry their citizen certificates with them at all times for inspection by patrolling police officers, otherwise they will be detained for questioning. The curfew was first implemented in 1933 during the Sino-Japanese War, and a second time in 1937. At that time, it was stipulated that citizens were not allowed to go out between 10:00 PM and 5:00 AM. The curfew hours were changed to 11:30 PM to 5:00 AM on September 2 of the same year, and then to 12:30 AM to 5:00 AM on March 12, 1938, until the date of the abolition of the curfew.</p>
<p>Advancing Closing Time</p>
<p>At the beginning of last year, the Bureau stipulated that all public places should close at 10:00 PM every night in order to reduce electricity consumption. The closing time was allowed to be extended to 11:00 PM in February, and then extended by one hour to midnight in August, provided that the places could comply with the air defense regulations and not exceed the set electricity consumption.</p>
<p>General Car License Measures</p>
<p>In accordance with the financial agreement for West Shanghai signed between the Bureau and the Municipal Government on December 10, 1941, private car licenses issued in the city or concession could be used interchangeably in each area. The French Concession Public Works Bureau also expressed its agreement to this matter, and the measure for the general use of private car licenses in the three districts was implemented from January 1 of last year. After consultation between the municipal authorities of the three districts, it was agreed to extend the above joint license measure to private bicycles, and a trial period of six months was carried out from July 1 of last year.</p>
<p>No Unauthorized Rent Increase</p>
<p>In 1941, the Bureau felt the need to manage the issue of rent and the prohibition of collecting tips. This issue was jointly discussed by a committee organized by the two concession authorities. The Bureau subsequently published a notice on December 24, 1941, advising landlords to be considerate of tenants who were unable to afford huge rents. If there were disputes, they could be submitted to the Bureau's Rent Mediation Committee for mediation. Before March 31, landlords were not allowed to force tenants to move out or increase rent without authorization. The restriction on rent increases was subsequently changed to allow rent increases if both the landlord and tenant agreed, or if approved by the Bureau's Mediation Committee.</p>
<p>Subletting Housing Requires a License</p>
<p>In order to relieve the general three-room tenants, the Bureau drafted Article 55 of the Property Regulations last year and submitted it to the Consular Body for approval. According to the provisions of the attached rules, the subletting housing licensing measure was implemented on April 1, ordering the second landlords of all residential houses within the boundary to obtain a subletting license. The most important clause of the license was to restrict the profits of the second landlord and prohibit the collection of tips.</p>
<p>Establishing a Employment Agency Section</p>
<p>In order to relieve unemployed workers, the Bureau decided to establish an Employment Agency Section in September of last year. Its task was to introduce unemployed workers to suitable positions. The Bureau also approved the employment of additional staff to carry out the important preparatory work of the section.</p>
<p>Child Protection Affairs</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the economic situation in this city changed, so the charitable organizations that cooperated with the Bureau to rescue children were mostly experiencing serious difficulties and refused to continue to take in refugee children. In view of this, the Bureau took temporary measures, using the Salvation Army Beggar Shelter to accommodate homeless children. It also hired ten additional staff members to find ways to return abandoned children to their families or find willing adopters.</p>
<p>Issuing Waterproof Bonds</p>
<p>In order to carry out the waterproof plan, 5 million yuan of 6% bonds were issued in June of last year. These bonds are scheduled to be redeemed by lottery every year from December 1948 until they are fully redeemed in December 1957.</p>
<p>Controlling Grain and Foodstuffs</p>
<p>A special committee oversees the maintenance of food supplies and other items. The committee's work report is detailed elsewhere and will not be repeated here. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Momentum of Chinese Stocks Continues to Surge, Especially Sharp in the Department Store Sector</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market situation, since the after-hours market last weekend, the department store companies' stocks launched a surge, the momentum intensified, investors disregarded high prices and absorbed them. The Lihua Company was the most prominent, reaching 382.5 yuan, with very few sellers, a huge jump of 25 yuan. The Guohuo Company rose sharply from 77 yuan to the 80 yuan mark on the same day, then settled at 79 yuan, an increase of 2.5 yuan. The Wing On Company soared by 5 yuan to 128-9 yuan.

San You Industrial traded at 150 yuan and 52.5 yuan. The small-denomination Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing buying price rose again to 18 yuan. The Dahua and other weaving stocks were flat. Yousheng Dyeing and Weaving rose to 12 yuan and was hard to find. The buying momentum in the cultural sector was also strong, with the World Book Company soaring to 117-8 yuan, an increase of 4.5 yuan. Zhonghua saw 185 yuan, finally rising 2.5 yuan, around the 180 yuan mark. The Commercial Press was uniquely flat, still between 470 yuan and 75 yuan. The Longmen Bookstore, since its reorganization into a limited company, increased its capital to 2.5 million yuan, at 10 yuan per share. It is heard that the Ministry of Industry has issued a license for it to be listed and circulated today. The number of buyers for the Nanyang Tobacco Company increased endlessly, suddenly rising 4 yuan to 133 yuan. The Dahua Match Company turned from fatigue to strength, with the final trading price being 315 yuan to 20 yuan. Among the new pharmaceutical companies, the Sino-French Pharmacy had a huge turnover, suddenly rising 1 yuan to 27.75 yuan. Sin Asia rose by 5 jiao, with 24.75 yuan being the transaction price. Minyi alone fell to the 60 yuan mark, down 2 yuan. Xinyi was 247.5 yuan, and Mingxing Eau de Toilette was 207.5 yuan, all flat. The public utilities sector was also quite firm, with Zhabei Water and Electricity reaching 65.5 yuan, and Huashang Electricity 45.5 yuan. At noon, each retreated slightly by half a yuan, both rising by 5 jiao. Zhejiang Xingye Bank traded at 785 yuan and 800 yuan. The food stocks, Shengyuan, were firm, and Merling Food was still soaring, according to all parties' sentiments, which were激昂 (passionate), and trading revived.</p>
<h3>Various Factions Hastily Covering Positions, Government Bonds Rising Even More Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market suddenly rose again, with the momentum becoming even stronger. The goods sold by various factions were hastily covered, and it was quite difficult to cover them. There were very few sellers, so the market trended upward, which was also the result of the environment. Yesterday, Class C started at 4 yuan, immediately rising by 1 yuan. Later, it even reached as high as 6.34 jiao, and finally, it still had 5.89 jiao. Class D rose from 50 yuan to 2.7 jiao, and finally, it also had 2.45 jiao. Class E was 3.2 yuan, rising to 4.2 yuan, and finally, it also had 3.8 jiao. Class B was around 5 yuan, and Class A was 5.56 jiao. All kinds rose by 2-3 yuan, the situation was very good, and there was hope for continued gains.</p>
<h3>Military Scrip Turning Firm Again, Joint Currency in Demand Exceeding Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was suspended at 1 jiao 7 fen, and it has not changed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the military scrip market turned firm again due to a small amount of settlement. The interbank trading price has risen to 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3.5 li. The trading price between small money shops and banks was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen and 6 fen, still flat. The Joint Reserve Bank notes were also rising in a state of demand exceeding supply. Operators bought in at 3 yuan, 9 jiao, 5 fen, and sold out at the 4 yuan mark, a huge squeeze of 1 jiao 5 fen, it is said.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Grains to be Subjected to Unified Control and Purchase</h3>
<p>The authorities have already implemented unified control and purchase of major agricultural products such as rice, wheat, and cotton produced in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, there is no unified control agency for miscellaneous grains. It is now learned that the authorities, in view of the large production of miscellaneous grains in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, also consider it necessary to strengthen control. Therefore, they have recently ordered Chinese and Japanese miscellaneous grain merchants in Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places to separately organize miscellaneous grains. Once the purchasing organizations in various places are fully established, the highest organization for unified control and purchase of miscellaneous grains in Central China will be organized.</p>
<p>Yesterday, miscellaneous grain trading in this city was still limited to soybean cakes, which were slightly traded. The market was firm because the owners raised the price. It is estimated that two cars of Kaiyuanlong soybean cakes were priced at 57 yuan to 56 yuan, and three cars of Feizi soybean cakes were priced at 105 yuan to 107 yuan. Soybeans, etc., have not been officially traded, and the asking prices are very high.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Market Falls Back</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market situation, due to reports that the authorities will strictly control prices and will not allow price increases without permission, people's minds suddenly became weak, and the market fell back. Fine cloth, etc., all fell by more than 10 yuan. Sijunzi Drill fell from 11.2 yuan to 10.6 yuan, with many fluctuations along the way, resulting in 10.9 yuan, a reduction of 3 jiao 5 fen. Peach Lady Silk of Colored Cloth is quoted at 480 yuan for spot goods, and White Cat Calico at 250 yuan.</p>
<h3>Waterproof Cloth Also Increases in Price</h3>
<p>The waterproof cloth market saw a great turnaround yesterday, and the market prices all saw sharp increases. The Golden Bear brand is quoted at 28 yuan per yard, the Daming brand at 24 yuan, and the Ape Tarzan at 22 yuan. The market inventory is not much. Because the factory is affected by the high price of raw materials such as yarn, and the difficulty of moving back and forth, the output of each manufacturer is small, and the buyers' needs continue to be continuous, so prices have also increased.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Remain Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics have consistently been in a state of shortage and expensiveness in recent days. Although transactions have decreased, the owners still remain weird, because the retail prices of door shops are lower than the wholesale prices on the market. Therefore, most woolen fabric shops are unwilling to post retail prices, and many post "limited to one purchase" signs.</p>
<h3>Ample Supply of Japanese Cigarettes</h3>
<p>The cigarette market price yesterday, British and American goods were slightly stronger, but they did not escape the swirling, because the end of the year is approaching, those with sufficient goods are temporarily waiting and watching, waiting for the establishment of the China Tobacco Association, how to allocate, so the price will not rise sharply. Japanese cigarettes are stable, because starting today, retail peers will be assigned A and B cards, the deadline is three days, so the allocation is quite sufficient, the price is flat as usual, the price of Daying brand is 12,000 yuan, Laodao brand is 10,200 yuan, Pinhai brand is 7,650 yuan, Wuhua brand is 6,650 yuan, and Fairy brand is 8,000 yuan, an increase of 100-200 yuan compared to the weekend. Japanese cigarettes Golden Spear brand 3,000 yuan, Golden Building 3,750 yuan, Red Rose 2,700 yuan, Quanlu brand 3,500 yuan, Guide brand 2,850 yuan, Guoyan Pyramid 6,400 yuan, Beauty brand 5,800 yuan, Golden Mouse brand 4,100 yuan, White Golden Dragon 4,150 yuan, very little change.</p>
<h3>Slight Changes in Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>The daily necessities market has been rising continuously recently. Yesterday, the price increase has been suppressed, but after all, the inventory is scarce and it is not easy to buy, so those who hold the goods set prices according to the situation. Although the transaction was sparse yesterday, the price was still stable. It is estimated that the price of Meili brand matches is 4,000 yuan, Phoenix brand 3,850 yuan, Jinding brand 12,200 yuan, Miscellaneous brand 2,150 yuan, Guben soap 780 yuan, Baixiangmao 730 yuan, Huangxiangmao 660 yuan, Scissors soap 750 yuan, White Reese candles 560 yuan, Monk Hat brand 480 yuan, Miscellaneous brand 340 yuan, the change is very small. The market price of medicines is slightly more expensive. It is estimated that the price of headache powder is 37 yuan, Wan Jin You 48 yuan, Bagua Dan 43.5 yuan, Partridge Vegetables 68 yuan, and Longhu Rendan 35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Thin Inventory of Scrap Iron</h3>
<p>The circulating goods of various thick and thin, large and small scrap iron in the market are not very abundant. Fortunately, the local demand is sluggish, and there is no imbalance between supply and demand for the time being. It is found that the inventory of these goods in Shanghai has been in short supply for a long time due to the lack of sources. Coupled with the long-term consumption, the spot goods are even thinner. Fellow traders who hold a small amount of inventory are thinking highly, and now there is a risk that the big square block and long block are nowhere to be found in the market. The only things circulating on the market are various thick and thin, uneven, large and small deputy scrap irons. Yesterday, the market was selling for about 10,000 yuan per ton. Those with high thoughts were also shouting for 11,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Zhongzhuangyuan Meat Offers a Suitable Price</h3>
<p>Zhongzhuangyuan meat, from outside the industry, had 50 pieces opened yesterday. The quality of the goods was average, and the color was relatively poor, about 150 yards worse than Gaozhuang. It was immediately distributed in full. Hainan cargo number has recently arrived about 600 packages. According to the owner's intention, he is unwilling to purchase and unload, so the asking price is more expensive than the Shanghai market.</p>
<h3>Abundant Arrival and Inventory of Jinshan Branches</h3>
<p>Jinshan branches are recently on the market with a relatively thick bottom inventory, and the number and range are lacking. It is found that more than 5,000 boxes have arrived recently, and as the end of the year is approaching, the number and the owners do not want to sell immediately with the market, and the spring market may be slightly shaken.</p>
<h3>Tight Market for White Skin Yaoqian</h3>
<p>White skin yaoqian has not arrived for a long time, and the market inventory is extremely scarce, so the asking price for old goods from Shangzhuang is also high. Yesterday, there was a batch of goods with a good appearance and color, and the trading party returned 400 yuan, but the transaction has not yet been completed.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Poor and Humble Couples</h3>
<p>— Jia Sheng</p>
<p>It is not easy for couples to get along well if they are too rich; it is also not easy for couples to get along well if they are too poor. If they are too rich, the "husband" often seeks pleasure outside; the "wife" is also often addicted to gambling, and as a result, they sleep in the same bed but have different dreams, and only have the name of husband and wife. These people do evil after being full and warm, and they are to blame and not worthy of pity.</p>
<p>What this article wants to talk about is poor and humble couples. The poet once said: "Poor and humble couples are sad about everything." Tasting this poem, the embarrassment of crying to each other in a straw coat is like it is happening now.</p>
<p>Despite advocating spiritual civilization, despite saying that the spirit is more important than material; but when the spirit is separated from the material, it becomes empty, disillusionment, and self-deceiving nouns! In the history of our country, there are two pairs of poor and humble couples that can be studied, one is Zhu Maichen, and the other is Liang Hong.</p>
<p>Zhu Maichen was a native of Kuaiji during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. When he was not famous, his family was very poor, and he made a living by selling firewood, reading as he went. His wife was ashamed of this and divorced him. Later, Maichen served as the prefect of Kuaiji and saw his ex-wife and her husband building roads. Maichen ordered the back car to carry the couple into the prefect's house. The wife was ashamed and angry and hanged herself.</p>
<p>Liang Hong was a native of Pingling in the Eastern Han Dynasty. He was orphaned and poor when he was young, but he had integrity. When he grew up, he read widely and made a living by herding pigs. He married Meng Guang and lived in seclusion in Baling Mountain. Later, Liang Hong was hired to work in the spring, and every time he returned, his wife prepared food for him, and they raised the tray to their eyebrows in respect.</p>
<p>The story of Zhu Maichen is the popular story of "spilled water is difficult to recover." The story of Liang Hong is the beautiful story of raising the tray to the eyebrows in respect. In history, there are no statistics on the separation and reunion of couples; however, these two pairs of poor and humble couples can be said to be an excellent contrast.</p>
<p>I think there are many stories similar to Zhu Maichen's in today's society. Although they do not necessarily divorce and leave, quarrels due to the husband not becoming an official or getting rich are commonplace. As for the story of Liang Hong and his wife living in peace and contentment, its rarity is probably like the friendship between Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya!</p>
<p>Since the implementation of new education in our country, everything blindly follows American hedonism and individualism. Women's education is controlled by the church, resulting in a group of vase-like "modern" women. They only know how to sing and dance; they only know about honeymoon trips, nutritional chemistry, and sanitary equipment. Some female students, for the sake of enjoyment, even degenerate into concubines of wealthy families. Women's education has declined to this point, what else can be said!</p>
<p>Therefore, many educated women often marry late or remain single; unless they can marry a husband who is one level higher than her and has property. If the husband's family declines after marriage, they will force the husband to become an official and get rich. In their eyes, Meng Guang is an unbelievably silly fool.</p>
<h3>Eating Porridge</h3>
<p>— Chun Qiu</p>
<p>The grain currently distributed according to the number of people is only enough for about five days of eating for every ten days. Helplessly, we eat porridge all day. The method is: use a small amount of rice, add a large amount of water, and cook it into a porridge that is so thin that it cannot be any thinner.</p>
<p>The consequence of the three children eating porridge every day is that they urinate a lot. This is because the excessive water in the porridge passes through the intestines and reaches the kidneys, and then turns into urine. It is winter, and there is already a lot of urine; in addition to eating porridge, the amount of urine is unexpectedly large. During the day, they often pee in their pants; at night, they often pee in the bed. To say it humorously: the dry faction children have become the wet faction. This is the law of conservation of matter at work, and it is not that the children lack the ability to absorb water. I can't bear to give them a good beating, I just hope that the amount of rice per household can be increased, and change from eating porridge to eating rice.</p>
<p>The children are used to eating porridge, and when serving porridge, they know the trick. They try their best to scoop the bottom of the pot with a spoon. In this way, relatively dry and thick porridge is served. Philosophers say that wisdom is only expressed when encountering difficulties, which has its basis.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the part of the porridge pot near the bottom is scorched and condenses into porridge blocks, which are thick and fragrant. If one of the children accidentally scoops it up, the other two children will quarrel. Confucius said: "I am not afraid of scarcity, but of inequality." They are all eating thin porridge, but if there is some inequality, they will still quarrel.</p>
<p>The parents, of course, eat the thinnest and least porridge. Protecting oneself and propagating offspring are the two major tasks of mankind. In order to maintain their own lifeline, all kinds of life and death struggles have arisen in the world, and they are unwilling to back down. In the world, only parents are willing to sacrifice "protecting oneself" for their children and maintain "propagating offspring."</p>
<p>Some people say that the monks have strict precepts, and hundreds of monks eat porridge at the same time without any sound. Some people also say that Cantonese chicken porridge and duck porridge have a special flavor. Some people also say that eating some porridge after eating oily food can reduce gastrointestinal diseases. Some people also say that a large company sees that there are more and more families eating porridge and prepares to newly produce several kinds of pickles to suit the occasion. We parents don't have the leisure to talk about these things when we eat porridge: the children don't have the interest to listen when they eat porridge.</p>
<h3>Number Addiction</h3>
<p>— Jia Sheng</p>
<p>In schools, scores are used to represent the academic performance of each student, and scores are used to encourage each student's efforts. When reviewing or taking exams, students generally hope to get more scores in each subject, preferably all 100 points. The amount of scores is indicated by numbers, so every student becomes addicted to numbers: moreover, the more hardworking and diligent the student, the deeper the number addiction.</p>
<p>The modern world is a scientific world, and almost everything is expressed in numbers. Large numbers are used to express the distance of each planet, the so-called astronomical numbers. Small numbers are used to express the radius of electrons. Other things such as the speed of airplanes, the production of goods, the amount of business, etc., are all expressed in numbers, and many often take breaking records as an honor. The world is a world of numbers, and life is also a life of numbers. In this way, everyone has to be addicted to numbers!</p>
<p>Do you hate numbers? If you really hate numbers, you will not be able to live.</p>
<p>Bankers, capitalists, especially speculators, can be said to be addicted to numbers. They are thinking and studying all day long: how can they earn hundreds of thousands of millions more, how can they get a profit of 100% or 200%. Their view of life is to increase, increase, and increase the number of assets to an infinite extent. In the last four or five years, a number of six or seven digits could satisfy them. Now it is not possible, it must be eight or nine digits!</p>
<p>Currently, a small clerk's salary must be at least three digits. A rickshaw puller's daily income must be at least two digits, otherwise they will have to starve to death. Therefore, small clerks and even rickshaw pullers are also addicted to numbers.</p>
<p>There are many chairmen and managers who "are cautious in gaining" and pay too much attention to the increase in their own numbers. They often neglect the numbers of the employees and partners. The employees and partners, if they "live," of course they can't "live" on; if they "die," they don't dare to "die"; therefore, "death" also requires a large number, at least four digits!</p>
<h3>Visit to Hongren Hospital</h3>
<p>— Shuo</p>
<p>Hongren Hospital, with a history of more than 70 years, serving the society and benefiting the people, is located at the corner of Aiwenyi Road and Chengdu Road. In order to understand the recent situation of the facilities, I made a special visit.</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived at the hospital, Dr. Jingyi Shuai graciously received and showed me around. His kind attitude and sincere feelings were admirable. The hospital was originally named Guangren, and was renamed to its current name after the war. It is under the same system as Tongren Hospital on Jiujiang Road. Hongren specializes in admitting women, and Tongren specializes in admitting men. The two hospitals have a total of more than 500 beds. The medical subjects are all available, and the scale is quite complete.</p>
<p>The source of funding, the income from consultation fees and medical expenses, accounts for most of it. In addition, there is a subsidy from the American Church, so the shortfall in previous years could be made up by this. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the subsidy has been cut off, and prices have risen sharply. The prices of medicines, cotton, gauze, etc. have increased from several times to dozens of times. Therefore, it has fallen into a situation where it is struggling to maintain itself. The hospital has always paid attention to public welfare facilities, and the fees are low, so the losses are even greater. Ordinary patients are only charged 4 yuan per day, including food and accommodation. Currently, the monthly expenses are 240,000 yuan for Hongren and 120,000 yuan for Tongren. Such huge expenses are really difficult. It is estimated that by next year, there will be a shortfall of about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Fundraising is currently underway, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will give enthusiastic assistance.</p>
<p>The treatment of employees in the hospital is also very meager. The living allowance is generally only about 100 yuan. Each year, 50 nurses are recruited in the spring and autumn seasons. The level must be above junior high school, and they are given three years of training. Tuition and accommodation fees are waived. The cost of bedding and clothing was also originally provided, but recently, due to economic difficulties, they must be provided by themselves. After graduation, they work in the hospital or are introduced to other places. The results are very good. It is a good opportunity for those who aspire to study nursing.</p>
<p>The hospital has a close relationship with the medical department of St. John's University. Most of the doctors in the hospital are professors at St. John's. Graduates of St. John's medical department must also intern at the hospital. The obstetrics department is particularly perfect. About 4,000 to 5,000 children are born in the hospital each year. The equipment is excellent and the care is comprehensive, which is praised by all parties in the society.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two things that seem particularly worth mentioning. One is that there are some doctors in the society who are close to fraud, who falsely post advertisements, such as saying that the fees are low, and everything is included. People are greedy for cheap and are deceived when they go, and they are transferred to the hospital for treatment. This is not uncommon. It damages money and puts lives in danger, and should be strictly inspected and cracked down on. Second, teachers are the most pitiful among patients. Their income is meager and their lives are poor. If the fees are too low, they are not used to the life. If the fees are slightly higher, they cannot afford them. It is proposed that enthusiastic people in the society specially plan a sum of money to give preferential treatment to poor teachers. If it can be realized, it is indeed very meaningful and valuable.</p>
<p>Before leaving, I visited the entire hospital for a week. When I returned, it was near dusk, and these various impressions were still lingering in my mind.</p>
<h3>The Model Teacher for All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yijin</p>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>This is a service, and this service gave him the freedom to take care of himself to the highest and fullest extent. Due to his age and virtue, he had earned the privilege of being alone; those who were slightly eccentric would often attack teachers and pastors, and he had also acquired their right. The robe on his body was always worn to the point where it was almost broken to the point where it could not be pieced together: he had a mysterious and informal air when he stood on the wooden bench next to the stone steps of the hall to call the roll. He managed the school list, a long piece of paper curled up on a board; every student, as he passed by, said his name, and Gipps made a small note on the list after checking. The glance he made when checking was something that everyone in the school liked to imitate for fun - the steel-rimmed glasses slid down the bridge of his nose, and the eyebrows, one high and one low, bounced up, making a half-amused and half-mocking gaze. On windy days, his robe, white hair, and school list fluttered in great confusion, and the whole thing became a ridiculous game, between the afternoon game and the resumption of class.</p>
<p>Some of the names, like some small choral pieces, would reappear in his heart without having to work hard to remember them. ... Ainsworth, Atteut, Afongmour, Barberke, Barges, Barnard, Barsonswait, Bartespay, Bergels, Bedford, Bendley, Buster...</p>
<p>Another section</p>
<p>... Enszat, Falgi, Wardhay, Wagerstaf, Warrington, Watters the First, Watters the Second, Watling, Wawenna, Webb...</p>
<p>There was another section that he had said to the Latin students in the fourth grade, which was the best example of a hexameter.</p>
<p>... Lancaster, Latton, Leemall, Leton, McGonigle, Mansfield...</p>
<p>He often wondered where these people had gone; how far had the thousands of threads that he had once held together been scattered, some broken, others woven into unknowable patterns? The chaos and impermanence of the world shook him, and that chaos would never again give those choral pieces any meaning as long as the world existed.</p>
<p>Behind Brockfield, when the fog cleared, you could see the overlapping mountain ranges in the same way, behind Brockfield, he saw the world of change and conflict; he saw this world, which he had not yet realized, was seen together with Katie's memorial eyes. She was not able to give him all of her mind, let alone the strengths of her mind; but she left him with quietness and openness, which was very much in tune with his inner emotions. His characteristic was that he did not, like the extreme patriots, desperately oppose the Boers not because he was a supporter of the Boers - he would never be so in tradition, he abhorred those who claimed to be supporters of the Boers; but, even so, in his heart he often had the thought that the Boers were engaged in a struggle that had a strange similarity to the struggles made by some heroes in British history - such as Herward the Wake or Caractacus. He had once thought of making this point to shock his fifth form, but they only thought it was one of his little jokes. (21)</p>

<h3>Gospel for the Poor Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>According to experts, various diseases tend to increase during wartime, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. Since its establishment, this newspaper has seen that there are many citizens suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, and the general poor patients are even more painful. Fortunately, the Hongqiao Sanatorium is holding X-ray examinations and free treatment. Please purchase this examination and treatment certificate from this newspaper. Anyone who holds the certificate and goes to the sanatorium for examination will receive free artificial pneumothorax (commonly known as air needle) treatment once lung disease is discovered. This move not only promotes early diagnosis and fundamental treatment of lung disease, giving patients the opportunity to regain their health; it also prevents the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis, which is of great importance to improving the health of the entire city, and the free treatment relieves all the pain of the poor patients, which is especially beneficial. It is indeed a gospel for pulmonary tuberculosis and poor patients. The detailed summary is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) This certificate is 10 yuan, please purchase it from the business department of this newspaper.</p>
<p>(2) Anyone who is found to have lung disease after being examined by X-ray at the sanatorium will receive free artificial pneumothorax treatment and will be given voluntary guidance on medical and nutritional methods.</p>
<p>(3) This examination and free treatment will be limited to one month for the time being. If it is effective, we will find ways to expand the relief.</p>
<p>(4) It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will promote the purchase of more certificates and give them to the poor patients to complete the anti-tuberculosis work.</p>
<h3>Report on Charity Relief Funds</h3>
<p>(1) Madam Sun, One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>(2) Huan Ji, One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>(3) Uncle Ji Hang Ji Hao Ji, Twenty Yuan each</p>
<p>(4) Bin Ji, Qi Ji, Kang Ji, and Xu Nanping, Ten Yuan each. Total for today: Three Hundred Yuan. Previous balance: Fourteen Thousand Nine Hundred and Forty-Three Yuan. Final balance: Fifteen Thousand Two Hundred and Forty-Three Yuan.</p>
<h3>Compilation of Free and Reduced Tuition Schools</h3>
<p>(1) Tianguang Elementary School, No. 853, Lujiabang Road, Nanshi, will continue to waive all tuition and miscellaneous fees for this semester, except for self-provided books. There is still a surplus in the fifth grade. If there are impoverished students seeking financial aid whose addresses are near our school or who are willing to travel a long distance to study, we can introduce them.</p>
<p>(2) Danhua Elementary School in Yonghua Lane, Nanyang Bridge, funded by Mr. Wang Yifeng and Mr. Cai Xueshan, in memory of Zhuxi Gong Wenli Gong, entrusted the school to enroll thirty outstanding impoverished students, with full waiver of tuition, miscellaneous fees, and textbook fees. The examination will be held on January 31st.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai Cheng Evening Middle School (Lane 384, Simalu) reserves five places in each grade of junior high school as free places for outstanding students recommended by this newspaper (books at their own expense). However, before entering the school, students must first pass an entrance examination to determine acceptance.</p>
<h3>YMCA Library</h3>
<p>The YMCA Library in Ba Xian Qiao, in order to facilitate the reading of books and newspapers by people from all walks of life, in addition to the regular opening on Sundays and holidays, has also newly added various types of books. Recently, it purchased a complete collection of business publications for reference by aspiring agricultural students. It is hoped that people from all walks of life can make full use of their spare time to increase their knowledge.</p>
