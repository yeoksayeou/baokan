<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>從騎牆主義說到亞洲大憲章</h3>
<p>— 蘇森</p>
<p>南京國民政府，在外交上已經獲得世界上十三個國家的正式承認，同時，更獲得以日本倡率而接着各有關國家的放棄治外法權和交還租界。一方面日本又在太平洋上奠定了制勝英美的基礎。在這兩種有利情勢之下，中國民衆還有一部份不能十分地傾向國民政府，和坦白地協力日本遂行大東亞戰爭。這是不必諱言的事實。</p>
<p>我們推究其原因，固然很多，可是，最主要的是在南京政府還有不能取信於人民的地方，和日本的態度還有不能予中國民衆完全滿意的地方。</p>
<p>半年之前，在某一個宴會席上，我曾經向幾位居於領導地位的中國朋友，問起這個原因，他們回答說，×××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××但是到現在爲止，中國人還是不能確實地明瞭日本的眞意，如果日本確以兄弟之義對待中國，中國人一定立刻起來協力日本擊潰英美。×××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××因此，對於協力大東亞戰爭一事，中國人目前還不能感到興趣。這種話也許過於極端，但也可以坦白表示着中國人的所謂「騎牆主義」的基本思想。</p>
<p>半年之後，經過此次日本對華政策的一大進展，又以各地抗日軍隊的覺悟抗戰之非，接踵歸順，南京國民政府政治力量逐漸加强，同時更因國際情勢之有利轉變，對於日本之誠意也逐漸認識，對於和平建國也加强信念。因此，騎牆主義者的確也有很多表明了態度。但是一部份的中國民衆，尤其是智識階級的懷疑躊躇的空氣，依然相當的濃厚。</p>
<p>當然，日本和南京國民政府對於消除此種騎牆主義，也要負相當的責任，首先日本當局應不再坐而言，必須進一步起而行，澈底實踐有誠意的對華政策。南京國民政府也要能够乾脆地肅淸所屬中的貪汚份子，以取信於人民。本着完成中國革命和對外爭取中國民族的自由獨立的基本路綫，以獲得廣大民衆的合作。不過，最大的效果，還須期待中國智識階級本身發動着積極的行動，以擁護政府，督促政府。</p>
<p>本來，所謂「智識階級」也者，都是有很高的理想而缺乏行動性的居多。這種現象是智識份子本身性格上的缺陷。不僅中國的智識階級如此，無論何時何地的智識階級也一概如此。但是，正因爲是「智識階級」，就必須去克服本身性格上的缺陷，而奮起積極的行動性來挽救中國和東亞的危局。</p>
<p>我有很多的中國智識階級的朋友，他們在大東亞戰爭發生以前，都在各種刋物上面，堅持着中國民族的利益，每天發表着煌煌的大文。但從大東亞戰爭勃發，南京政府力量進展到租界以後，他們中的小部份，還是保持着緘默的態度。其唯一的理由，就是「無從說起」。甚至有人旣置身於南京，但絕不肯公開地露出名字，更談不到什麽負責了。這種態度，無論如何，我總認爲不妥當的。我相信任何事情，只要奮起積極的行動性爲前提，那末，無論處在何種境地都會有辦法的，况且，現在的南京政府正期待着民衆的合作。而日本也決不會來干涉到此種中國人自身的問題。</p>
<p>又在某一個宴會席上，一位日本人對一位中國的智識階級中人說：中國的東亞聯盟運動，必須不管日本的態度如何，儘管去組織民衆，貫徹宗旨，開始大規模的運動。所謂「盟主」一事，其實日本也好，中國也好，都不必爭執的。那位中國人說，照現在的情形，中國的東亞聯盟是無從運動的，需要日本把中國的現狀改一改。這樣說來，他們的綱領之一的「政治獨立」，無非是希望別人的幫忙而得到，談不到什麽運動不運動了。於此也可以看出智識階級的缺乏行動性的一端。</p>
<p>亞洲大憲章問題，在中國智識階級之間，却有相當多數的人在提起。在報章上有陳孚木先生論文，有申報社論。在私人談話中也常常聽到。在日本方面，雖然沒有說是亞洲大憲章，日本東亞聯盟的最高幹部之一，伊東六十次郞氏會言及此事。他說：日本需要向東亞各國家各民族表明日本對他們所要求的界限。這個動機和中國智識份子的提倡亞洲大憲章是同樣出發點的。因爲，中國智識份子的提倡亞洲大憲章，不問憑藉何種理由，其直接的動機的出發點，是在要求日本表明對中國要求的界限。而拉攏其餘國家和民族參加在內，以期互相保證。此種企圖，在中國人立塲是非常正當，絕對沒有排擊的理由，而且，在原則上亞洲各國的民衆，亦應該贊成而起來促其實現。如果能够實現，來規定亞洲各國和各民族應負的責任和權利保證的界限，那末，所謂騎牆主義也一定可以自然消滅。不過，在事實上，是「談何容易」！</p>
<p>陳孚木先生在第五期「中國與東亞」卷頭論文「亞洲大憲章問題」一文中，會舉出如下幾個問題：</p>
<p>（一）亞洲大憲章，在原則上實有提出的必要。但這大憲章應用什麼方式提出呢？是應山亞洲各國當局馬上來確定呢？抑或應由亞洲各國思想界先行硏究和推動，然後由各當局共同確定呢？</p>
<p>（二）這憲鞏的內容應根據着幾個怎樣的原則來確定呢？而這些原則應偏重實際方面呢？抑還要兼顧到思想方面呢？</p>
<p>最困難的問題的確就在這幾點。所謂各國當局來確定，照現在的情形，有幾個國家的當局恐怕是不能做到受各該民衆的同意的。由思想界先行硏究推動，然後由各國當局共同確定，時間未免太長。原則偏重實際就不能顧到思想，偏重思想就不能顧到實際，這是亞洲大憲章中最困難的問題。退一步說，縱使勉强克服了一切困難，形式上果然成立了一個「亞洲大憲章」。然而有關各國和各民族實際上沒有自主的力量，只想靠他人之力，任人主宰，就是有了如何堂皇的大憲章，也未必可以兌現。這不是和沒有一樣的嗎？</p>
<p>說來說去，還是要期待智識階級，認淸客觀情勢，變革智識份子特有的本身缺陷的非行動性，奮起積極的行動性，起來督促政府，使政府能够保持國家的尊嚴，能够代表和領導民衆爭取民族和國家的自由獨立。政府有此實質，有此力量，才能談到政治獨立或訂定亞洲大憲章的間題。如果智識份子依然是騎牆主義，國家依然是無力，那末，政治的獨立及其餘的保證，只希望人家送來，天下是沒有這樣便宜的事。</p>
<p>過去的是永久不會再來，這非但時間如此，一切事象亦是如此。所以，我要重複的說，任何事情只要奮起積極的行動性，那末無論處在何種境地都是有辦法的。希望許多中國朋友們，起來督促政府，挽救中國的危局，共同保衛我們亞洲人的亞洲。</p>
<h3>日俄戰役　三十八年前本報之紀戰　舊報新抄（完）</h3>
<p>論日本戰勝之關係（載本報第一一五三八號光緒三十一年四月三十日西歷一九〇五年六月二日禮拜五）</p>
<p>俄以第二第三波羅的海艦隊爲孤注一擲，經半月有餘，橫渡大西洋，印度洋，而入太平洋，冀突入海參威，與日本海軍決一死戰，以恢復東亞之海權者，今則主力之艦，幾盡殲滅，兩司令長官皆爲俘虜。日本之損失，雖未詳知，然其操全勝之勢，已可預決。此一戰也，爲自有鐵甲戰鬥艦以後之第一大海戰，又爲二十世紀開幕之第一大海戰，又爲歐亞兩洲之第一大海戰。其關係於亞東全局也，遠則吾不敢知，試言其近者。</p>
<p>一曰關於於日本海陸戰鬥之全局也。當甲午之役，俄德法三國，逼日本退還遼東半島也，日本憤怒異常，經海陸軍各大臣會議之後，卒以其時三國之海軍，非日本所敵，而二十萬之大軍，孤懸於遼東，設海權一失，則不可收拾，遂茹痛隱忍，而重訂退出遼東之的，至今日之局，則又非昔比矣。大軍之在滿洲老，數倍於甲午之役，一切餉糈器械之供給，全賴海路之一綫接濟。故當旅順未閉塞之前，日本不敢以一陸軍登遼東半島，亦懼其海軍之牽制襲擊也。設今日海軍一敗，則自黃海以至日本海，皆俄艦勢力範圍所及之區，而日本海上之交通，必將全行杜絕，雖釜山至義洲鐵路，年內可通，然對馬海峽之咽喉，一爲俄艦所扼，則此鐵路亦歸無用，而去年滿洲大軍血戰所得之地，將供給斷絕，前功盡棄。俄人第深溝高壘以待之，日軍固已不戰而自潰矣。然則俄艦隊敗，其勢不至直接牽動陸軍，日艦敗，則陸軍與之俱敗。故日本之危機，伏於此戰者，較之俄人爲允大也。今幸一戰而敵艦盡覆，使和平之期，益以接近，於戰局關係之大，蓋可想矣。</p>
<p>一曰關係於亞東之商務也，日俄交戰連年，除東三省外，商務未見受其影響，即日本去年之商務，亦未見有衰退之象，則由制海權之不爲俄人所得故耳。數日之前，傳聞波艦至長江，本埠之運貨出口者，保險價騰踊，而通往</p>
<p>日本之貨，市面幾爲斷絕，設此戰者俄人一勝，而得制海之權，則此後中國海之往來船隻，皆將受俄艦之檢查，而各國在東亞之商務，皆將大爲阻滯，日本之商務允將歇絕，不待戰敗，而經濟界上已不可支矣。而俄人則商務素微，雖失海權，一時亦未見困，此亦日本之勢，倍危於俄者也。今對馬一戰，幾如數日陰　，經迅霆而豁然開朗，自此往來口外之商船，皆可馳行無阻，而俄義勇艦之遊弋於長江口者，亦將匿跡銷聲，而受中立國之保護，固必然之勢也。</p>
<p>至兩軍勝負之所由分，或曰主客勞逸之攸殊也，或曰兩艦隊速率之不同也，或曰海軍士卒之技藝有等差也，或曰兩軍陣法之善不善也，此固然矣，然我謂兩軍勝敗之故，允有最易見且最緊要之一端兀，曰：一有戰志，而一無戰志也。日艦主以靜制動之勢，守於對馬海峽者，數日矣，日盼俄艦之來而一戰。俄艦則遷延徘徊，故晦共行踪，以避日艦之警視綫，而突入海參威爲主，故當兩眾相遇，一則如餓虎之出神，一則如窮獸之狂竄，自主帥以至士卒，兩軍之氣旣已判如霄壤，一欲戰而一不欲戰，此亦其勝負所由分之一原因歟？</p>

<h3>紀念日本海軍節　京市昨舉行演講會　到中日官民數千人盛况空前　任河長寺岡顧問均發表演說</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　本月二十七日爲友邦日本第三十八屆海軍紀念日，當此大東亞戰爭逐步得勝，日海軍已獲得偉大戰果，我海軍部與宣傳部爲表示慶祝日海軍紀念，特聯合於二十九日晚七時半，假座大華大戲院舉行講演電影大會。到有海軍部任海長·宣傳部郭次長，及各部會長官曁來賓等數千人。大會開始後，首由樂隊奏中日兩國海軍歌，决由宣傳部郭决長致開會詞，繼由海軍部任部長致辭，末由日海軍顧問寺岡少將演講。演講畢，音樂節目由日海軍樂隊擔任，演奏各名曲，精彩異常，並放映電影：（一）夏威夷影片，（二）馬來戰記，（三）中國海軍建設。各片均爲實地攝取，於中日海軍活動實情，對兩國海軍精神表現無遺，尤爲歷史巨片。觀衆均興奮異常，十一時許始散會。</p>
<p>郭宣次開會詞</p>
<p>大意謂西方侵略勢力東來，有三路綫，一爲經西伯利亞鐵路而南下，一爲以印度爲根據地，經新嘉坡而北上，還有一條是以菲律賓爲根據地，而東進，升堂入室。要之，以中國爲其侵略之總對象，三十八年前五月二十七日，日本海軍擊破波羅的海艦隊，已經把由北南下的侵略勢力塞住了。這個勝利不是日本單獨，一國的勝利，而是東方民族第一次打破西方侵略的勝利。這勝利的結果，不單影響日本一國的國民心理，而且影響到整個東亞的民族心理，即東亞民族的自信心，從此恢復，東亞民族的自覺意　，從此萌芽了。因爲東亞民族那時候起，有了這樣的自信與自覺，知道自已如果能够發奮圖强，東亞民族終有從侵略勢力底解放出來之一日。所以不斷地與英美相搏鬥，這次大東亞戰爭爆發，就是這種搏鬥之總表現，也是對英美侵略勢力的總淸算。國民政府認定大東亞戰爭是東亞民族的解放戰爭，所以毅然參戰，其他民族，亦到處燃起反侵略的火炬，我們深信最近將來英美南來的侵略路綫★亦將在這一戰而切斷。友邦海軍在太平洋將發揮其更大之　力，完遂大東亞戰爭，爲東亞創一更光榮更偉大的紀念。日</p>
<p>任海長演說詞</p>
<p>今天宣傳部與海軍部在此舉行這個盛會，慶祝日本海軍的紀念日，本人以海軍部長的資格，與各位一同參加，感到非常的榮幸。今年五月二十七日是日本海軍紀念日的第三十八週，回溯三十八年以前，即日本明治三十八年五月二十七日，在那時候，聖將東鄕元帥，總率聯合艦隊，在日本海的對馬海峽，邀擊帝俄遠征的波羅的海艦隊。日本海軍將士，在東鄉元帥指揮之下，浴血奮戰，將帝俄的波羅的海艦隊，一舉擊滅，獲軍艦二十一艘，計十三萬八千餘噸，並俘其主將，戰果之偉大，爲曠古所未有。其影饗到現在最大者的有三點：（一）東亞賴以保全，（二）日本國勢日益昌隆，（三）帝俄的海軍消滅，至今不能再建。以上一二兩點，與我們東亞民族有切身利害的關係，第三點也一直影響到今日的德蘇戰爭軸心國之勝利。自大東亞戰爭發生，日本海軍復以其傳統之精神，協力陸軍空軍，擊敗英美，將其百年來侵略東亞之惡勢力驅逐於東亞天地之外，今値此日本海軍紀念日的第卅八周，凡屬東亞民族固應同生共死，以示團結。我們記得當卅八年前東鄕元帥激勵將士，有皇國興廢，在此一舉之訓詞。我們現在要曉得這次大東亞戰爭，是東亞興廢在此一舉。卅八年前日本海陸軍將士以及全國民衆每個人有此種精神，遂得到勝利，所以我們東亞人今天也應以此精神，來爭取勝利，允有進者，我國海軍方在新興途中，有待於日本海軍之指導與協助者頗多，本人謹以十二分之至誠，慶祝日本海軍之隆盛，並希望我全國民衆對新興海軍加以認識，得以日形發展，而有一日能與日未海軍共同担任保衛東亞之任務於太平洋上，則中國之幸，亦日本之幸，東亞之幸也。</p>
<p>寺岡顧問演詞</p>
<p>中國海軍山國民政府規定每年四月一日爲海軍節，是日爲國民政府創設海軍之一日，而民國卅一年之四月一日，亦爲最初之全國海軍會議日。中國取其意爲統一全國海軍之日，故定爲海軍節日。日本方面亦有同樣之海軍紀念日，緣日俄戰爭時，日本海軍邀擊帝俄第一第三太平洋艦隊於日本海，獲得大勝，於是日本規定五月廿七日爲海軍紀念日，此後年年歲歲，均加以紀念，國民回憶昔年海軍將士之奮戰精神，均無不感奮與覺悟。今爲其第卅八回紀念日，國民政府、正於此時參加大東亞戰爭，與日本同生共死，走向完遂擊滅英美戰爭之途，中國首都各界人士，對我等多所勉勵，感激無盡，而今而後，吾等唯有更加努力，以不負諸君之期望。</p>

<h3>日本海海戰與太平洋海戰</h3>
<p>— 富永謙和</p>
<p>（續昨日第三版）</p>
<p>現在太平洋　戰域—尤以所羅門及新幾內亞方面，正展開着畫夜不息的航空擊滅戰，而敵方的進出於瓜達爾卡納爾島，也使海戰有轉化爲基地爭奪戰的模樣。至少我們感覺到海戰塲面不苒是廣大的海面，以基地爲巾心的基地攻防戰，繼海戰而興了。</p>
<p>我們時常聽到，空軍萬能論，戰艦不要論，基地飛機至上論，甚囂塵上。</p>
<p>敵人空襲日本木土的呼號，也不時可以聽到。</p>
<p>大家都相信太平洋戰局正立在十字路口，太平洋島嶼的爭奪戰，旣不是今後戰局的方向，空中擊滅戰亦非戰爭的手段。光用空襲亦不能使戰爭結束。</p>
<p>戰爭是有對手的，軍備究竟是相對的。在這裏，我們不能不要認識敵人用何方策適應現實以挽囘頽勢而轉取攻勢。</p>
<p>半年來所羅門方面的戰局，雖在美國已付了很大的犧牲，但並未好轉。反之，日本却跟着戰略態勢的進展而確立了轉進作戰的基礎。羅斯福强辯作戰的失敗說：『不想從一個一個島攻至日本』，且作豪語稱：『利用中國基地空襲日本本土是唯一的方法。』</p>
<p>然而這空襲日本是美國的窮途末路之計，美國很明瞭日本本土的焦土化不是輕而易舉的。先前宋美齡渡美要求强化駐渝美空軍的時俠，當時的陸軍航空隊司令官的答覆就是明證。</p>
<p>「美國現在把兵力分散派遣於各個戰塲，祇中國沒有。如其要派遺兵力到中國，除使用緬甸路綫外沒有別的方法，而空中述輸也因夏季的雷雨及冬季的寒氣而不可恃。」最後，他結論說，「總之，那種事是不可能的」。</p>
<p>不消說，美國自然極重視從中國本土出發轟炸日本，此由於最近把駐渝美空軍獨立爲第十四航空部隊可推察得知的。用這種手段，當然不能挫折國民的戰意，使日本屈服。</p>
<p>使用大隊空軍實施連續空襲，當作一種最有效果的方法，或從北方高斯出發，或從中途島出發，或從海上出發，這計劃爲一部分空軍萬能論者所支持，但是爲了想挽　今日以前的頹勢，他們的計劃，首先在打算保全與強化殘剩的重要戰略基地，然後把戰塲漸漸地逼近日本的占領地和日本本土。因此，他們就企圖獲得全部太平洋的英國屬領，以爲租軍法案的代價，新幾尼亞，新海蒲里台斯諸島，新西蘭等，事實上已成爲美國有力的航空基地。僅其整備費即已耗達七億元之多。澳洲之爲强大的根據地，自不待言，僅在南太平洋戰綫，據我們推測，配備航空兵力的近二千架。</p>
<p>空軍要展開決定的攻擊，必須海軍合作，尤其在渡洋轟炸極爲困難的對日攻擊的塲合爲然。這是美國的戰略思想。美國的指導精神，以爲用飛機與水上艦艇來制覇海洋，是獲致勝利最大的條件。爲要使敵地化爲戰塲，制海權是絕對必要的。</p>
<p>因此，以航空母艦六十隻爲主體的大建艦計劉，正在着着進行中。無論如何，大海軍，大航空兵力是必不可缺的。然後用空軍實施眞正的空襲日本方才可能，這是美國的計釗。</p>
<p>他們動不動宣稱空襲日本，這不過是現在大規模對日反攻準備未完成以前的辯解。據他們所抱的見解，不能不有一次對戰局有決定的影響的大海戰。</p>
<p>這是否就是日美一決雌雄之日，姑暫勿論，唯如反攻的出發點完全失陷了，艦隊全滅了，那就是敗北。</p>
<p>這戰爭正如他們所言，將決於大平洋。能否支配海洋，將繫於此戰的勝敗，在昔日，在今日，這情勢並未有所變更。</p>
<p>這戰爭是生存與滅亡之途的抉擇。所課於我們的使命，我們祗有在所有的分野上堅持與實行擊滅精神。我們一億民衆，現在又肩負了重再獲得像日本海海戰一樣光榮的戰果。我們應明確認識，民族的興廢，存亡的歧路，即在目前。（翔：譯自『現代』五月號）（完）</p>

<h3>德蘇在庫班沼澤地帶展開坦克車大會戰　進攻橋頭堡蘇軍已全部被擊退</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十九日中央社電　據東綫消息，蘇軍自二十六日，於庫班橋頭堡開始總攻後，因遭遇德軍勇敢反攻，迄二十七日晚，其兵力狙擊兵十師團坦克車五旅團，已蒙殲滅打擊而敗退，至二十八日晨，又陸續出動新銳兵力，開始總攻，兩軍乃於庫班河口之沼澤地帶，展開坦克東大戰，頃據前綫消息，德軍當局，因此次蘇軍，以庫班橋頭堡爲夏季作戰之序幕，故對戰局之推移，極爲重視。又英美消息方面亦稱，蘇軍攻勢目的，在奪回庫班橋頭堡，然後經山刻赤，克復克里米亞半島恢復黑海制新權，此乃係應付軸心軍進攻巴爾幹作戰之對策，故對此情勢，亦極重視。二十八日之戰局，因消息混亂，眞相無從判明，惟據悉蘇軍飛機坦克車，喪失甚大，戰鬥若如此繼續，德軍利用共富有彈力性之迂　包圍戰法，則蘇軍實有再蹈卡科夫敗戰覆轍之虞，故對此極表焦慮云。</p>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電</p>
<p>德元首大木營二十八日發表，東綫庫班橋頭堡方面之蘇軍，二十七日竟日於坦克車及空軍部隊掩護下進攻，經德軍空陸協力邀擊，巳將其全部擊退，此外德軍空擊隊及偵察隊頗爲活躍，其他戰綫極平穩。</p>
<h3>黑田中將繼會　菲島最高指揮官</h3>

<p>黑田發表就職聲明　馬尼拉廿九日中央社電　新任菲島方面，日陸軍最高指揮官黑田中將，於到任之際，對部屬發表聲明，大意謂，「菲島戰事，於去年五月七日，考勒基要塞陷落及全美菲軍無條件投降後，即吿結束，時已一年，治安及建設狀况，均達於滿足之狀態。此乃我軍民在前任本間田中兩最高指揮官指導之下，一致努力，及菲島官民眞誠協力所致，余對此深表欣慰，並決將今日所獲之成果發揮擴大，今日本已在斷然決意之下，於亞洲大陸及太平洋各地，從事車擊滅英美之戰爭，吾人進行此歷史上罕有之大規模戰爭，決直至成功而後已。開戰一年半以來，吾人已收穫莫大之戰果，並奠定最後勝利之基礎，敵方曾疾聲高呼，一九四三年爲反攻年，但其攻勢已於本年初在印度戰綫被吾人粉粹，此足證我人已在任何地點，均巳保持作戰主動之態勢，而余於此願與諸君共勉，男猛遭進。」</p>
<p>馬尼拉二十九日中央社電新任日菲島派遣軍最高指揮官黑田重德中將，於本日十二時十二分，乘機飛抵此間機塲。日菲島派遣軍部隊首腦各部隊長，並行政府各部長官等多人，均到塲歡迎云。</p>
<h3>阿圖島日軍奮戰　繼續　予美軍打擊</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城二十丸日中央社電　美軍自在阿圖島登陸後，已二週有餘，美海軍部雖時發表充滿希望之公報，但經日軍以募兵繼續奮戰，乃結果美軍似已遭受極大打擊。茲美海軍部復於二十八日發表公報稱，五月二十六日，北太平洋方面美軍部隊，會於山岳地帶之戰塲上與日軍展開激烈之白刃戰，又美海軍部所發表之戰况公報，迄二十六日後，即從未述及戰况之情形，茲據其發表之公報稱，傳美解放式重轟炸機米卡爾中型轟炸機及閃電式戰鬥機等，曾協力美陸軍部隊作戰云。又美軍發言人並曾稱該島之戰况，因日軍將兵勇戰不懈，故雙方已展開白刃戰云。是已承認日軍壯烈勇鬥之情神矣。</p>
<h3>英美軍代表續在華府開會</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　據海通社引華盛頓消息稱，華盛頓之英美軍事代表團，昨日又復集會，決定羅邱會議結果炎歸後細則。華盛頓報界，因羅邱會議，十六日後，僅於兩日前由羅斯福總統簽名發表一廿二字之文告，殊爲不滿，故向官方要求至少對會議之具體結果，給與暗示，但官方仍嚴守緘默，謂彼等自己亦不知其詳云。</p>

<h3>海軍魂（四）　敬佩的舵手</h3>
<p>— 猪熊弦一郎</p>
<p>這是我還在兒童時代就很認戲的一位〇〇中尉故事。當在上次甫太平洋海戰出征的〇〇歷，　敵終了很走上歸途時，敵國機羣固持地繼續着迫羣而來，終於不幸而擊中他所服務的軍艦。周圍的戰友們一個一個地倒下了，有的受了傷，他在下腹部也受到致命的重傷。給及時跑來的看　乓指着說：「我不要緊。先去救護別人去』！</p>
<p>他這樣說着，一雙手用力按着　口，而另一雙手却把着羅旋機，自己在部下的面煎，宛如一塊崇高的巨岩雙立着。</p>
<p>恨不能早一刻駛出轟炸團，他這種不顧生死的勞力，從未把自己逐漸凉下去的身體少數放在心上。在他的心靈裏，只有一顆天皇的臣民之神聖大公無我精神。一個換着一個地緊念治療，他微笑地看看自己戰友們抬走，他一直到最後守護着自己的崗位，很美滿地完成了自己所掌掛的職實，約一個半鐘頭完全把軍艦拖到了安全地帶，於是他就在羅旋機傍伏着仙逝了。</p>
<p>這一段故事是從他年幼的弟弟聽來的，以生命來保守自己崗位的神聖責任感，此外還有比生命更强周留念，這種精神竟被上至艦長下至兵士所完全尊率，這可以說是祟高無比的海軍魂，　得我們全國同胞頂禮摩开的。（濟　自朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>日軍與太平洋制霸</h3>
<p>— 本內達三</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭開始以來，迄今已一年有餘，現在日本正傾全力以完遂大戰。英美兩國企圖把東亞的天地置於自己的壓制之下，在太平洋上制覇，以途其恣意榨取的妄想，因而爆發了這次戰爭，那是無需再說的了。</p>
<p>大東亞諸民族做英美肆暴的犧牡。已有很悠久的時期了，共文化被破壞，其生活陷於種度悲慘的境地。他們還誘騙荷蘭。澳洲，嗾使蔣改權，以途其野心，或於日本的局團增强武備，或則實行經濟絕交，把一切的威脅加諸日本，但日本則儘量隱忍自重，努力於事件之和平解決。但但們却因此以日本爲易與，以致愈益增加其暴慢的態度，蹂躪帝國大理想『八紘一宇』的精神，不特企圖把日本歷年來安定大東亞的努力盡付東流，甚至想使日本的生存陷於危殆之中。因此，爲了大東亞永久的和平幸福及自衛起見，日水乃蹶然而起，於是　發了以太平洋作中心的一大戰爭。</p>
<p>原來世界的文化，發源於地中海沿岸，而支配了地中海的羅馬帝國取得了西歐的覇權。之後。舞台遷至大西洋，一時成爲西班牙的全盛時代，但因共施策缺少堅實性，不久即爲英國所壓創。其後百有餘年問，乃是大西洋時代。而英國實爲其覇者，以迄今日。至二十世紀。舞古乃三遷而成爲大平洋時代，以太平洋的利權爲中心的列强間的角逐，備極熾烈。在這角逐中佔得優勝的國家則興盛，不然則衰弱，原是理所當然的事車。現在我國正着手興亞聖業而開始一大飛躍之際，乃遭逢這得未曾有的電大時局。事之成與不成，全在於制海權（包括制空權）的能否確保，就是說，日本海軍在必要方面的海上完成了控制，實是日本國家發展的基礎和核心。</p>
<p>根據『古本記』和「日本書記」的記戰，大和民族從上古以來就是海洋民族，是注定了要在海上發展並且支配海洋的民族。相傳皇祖天照大神的御弟素戔鳴尊，曾華了伊奘諸命的「海原統治』的詔勅，專心致力於海洋的支配。據說那時海途遙遠、陸海相連，彥火火出見電就由道海途去到「海神之宮」，把『潮滿瓊」和『潮涸瓊』取了同來，靠了這二個瓊的力量，就能支配海潮的漲落。肇國諸神親近海洋並且征服海洋的許多傅說，足以說明我們的遠祖早已作爲一個海洋民族而在海上發展的事實。神武天皇東征以來，日本的海洋發展，雖時有盛衰，但降至甲午，日俄兩次戰役，日本海軍首先首先獲得制海權，繼以陸軍的大陸作戰而完成終局的目的。以太平洋爲背景的日水帝國，可說從肇岡以來即以太平洋生活作爲其根本的。</p>
<p>太平洋位於亞洲之東，美洲之西，面積一八·〇二一萬方公里，佔世界海洋之半。說起它的來歷，歐洲人中最初發現太平洋的，大家認爲是麥哲倫（Ecrmando　Magellan　1480-1521）。他在一五二一年發現菲列濱羣島，但是在此以前，葡萄牙人已由印度洋方而到太平洋，把印度的果阿（Goa）作根據地，征服了爪哇，麻六甲（Malcca），並至廣東與中國通商，那是一五一　七年的事。其後於一五四三年，也到過日本的種子島。西班牙把南美的大部份以及中美劉入共版圖之後，由東面進入太平洋而佔領菲列濱羣島。以馬尼刺爲根據地，把婆羅洲。新幾尼亞·拉德倫羣島（Ladrone　Islands），加羅林羣島（Caroline　Islands），所羅門羣島等地置於其支配之下，時爲一五七一年。至十七世紀。葡西兩國的殖民政策頗失土著的人心，荷蘭乃乘隙而入。漸决奪取葡西兩國的領土和商權，於一六〇九年並與我國通商，在爪哇建立吧城（Batavin）爲根據地，奪取全部南洋諸島，連臺灣也暫時算作其領土。一方面英國人於一六〇〇年設立東印度公司，進入太平洋、於一六〇九年也和日本通商。至於日本人，在海外渡航發展者亦不在少數，例如橫行西太平洋之『倭寇船』，太閤秀吉所核准之「御朱印船」·但自天草之亂以後，德川幕府即禁止國人之海外航行，除荷蘭人中國人外，國外貿易亦在禁止之列。因此日本人在太平洋上的勢力完全衰滅。至十八世紀，英國人因經營印度，一時無暇顧及到太平洋方面，但自印度平定後，即開始澳洲的拓殖。俄羅斯於十七世紀宋葉由西怕利亞出太平洋，於卡薩林二世（Catherinne　II）時代，探險千島近海，把其中大部份加以佔領，一八六〇年並請求與日本通商。至十九世紀，英國的澳洲開發大爲發展，他方面於一八二四年得新加坡，一八四二年得香港，租借威海衛，確立了太平洋上最大的勢力，一九〇〇年許澳洲聯邦自治。俄國的經營亞洲，至十九世紀而大有進步，建海參威港，甲午戰爭後，在滿洲扶殖勞力，租借旅順大連，企圖在太平洋伸張其勢力。法國自十九世紀中葉起，致力於越南之經濟，一八五九年得西貢，繼以柬埔寨（Cambodge）安南爲保護國，並得東京（Tonkin）。又從暹羅得湄公河（MekngRiver）以南的地方，在太平洋的一角確立其勢力。德國自十九世紀末開始注視太平洋方面，與英國荷蘭瓜分新幾尼亞，繼而佔領俾士麥羣島（Bismarck　Arch-ipelago），馬沙爾羣島（Mar-shall　Islands），並租借膠州灣，從西班牙購買馬利亞納，帕勞（Mariana　Islands,Palan　Islands）爾羣島，與美國平分薩摩亞羣島（Samoa　Islands），而成爲太平洋上的一個勢力。</p>
<p>美國一向保持門羅主義（Monroeism　），自卞九世紀末起採取帝國主義，一八九八年倂吞夏威夷，於美西戰爭中得到關島與非列濱羣島，在太平洋上伸張勢力，從十九世紀末業起，太平洋入於定期船航行時代，而貿易日趨繁盛。</p>
<p>我　於明治維新後急速發展，甲午戰後取得台灣，日俄戰爭中阻止了俄國之伸入太平洋，並得庫頁爲的南半，更合併朝鮮而厠身於强國之列，在北太平洋確立了勢力。一九一四年第一次世界大戰勃發，我國即與英國共同佔領太平洋上的德國殖民地，我陸海軍並攻略膠州灣掃除了德國的勢力。和平恢復後，舊德國殖民地中，赤道以南諸島歸英國，以北諸爲歸日本委任統治。這樣。大戰後的太平洋以環繞它的日俄英美諸國的關係而有着特別重大的政治意義，這局勢一直發展到大東亞戰爭爲止。</p>
<p>原來美國的國策，是由海軍軍官馬罕（Alfred　Thayer　Mlahn，－1840-1914）的主張發育成功的。他在其名著之一「何謂國策』的題下說過這樣的話：『所謂國策就是國家於必要時決心用武力來支持貫澈的政策，而在美國的塲合，統是門羅主義和中國門戶開放問題。然而在門羅主義方而看不出有發動武力的必要，但是爲了防止遠東方而均勢的破壞起見，雄大的海軍力是必要的。』當時的美國大總統對於這個敎　頗爲感奮乃於美西戰爭中斷然佔領菲列濱羣島，以此作爲確保對於中國問題的發言權以及伸入中國市塲的據點，這就是全靠了宣稱『菲島的領有猶如在太平洋上架一座橋』的馬罕的敎訓。在太平洋上架起這座橋來，就是向中國的進展，目標在於太平洋的制覇，爲了這個目的而設計的建造大海軍，統是所謂「史塔克計劃」，以總額一百二十七億美元着手於歷史上空煎龐大的軍備擴張——至一九四六年底，完成戰艦三十五艘（其中包含五萬五千噸級者），航空母艦二十艘，巡洋艦八十八艘，驅逐艦三百七十八艘，潛水艇一百八十艘，合計七百零一艘，總噸數三百五十萬噸。後來因爲大東亞戰爭爆發，以致因航空母艦的急增等級多少有所變更，然而建艦費的支出却愈見增多。但是菲島於開戰後數月即吿擊潰，西太平洋的據點已經全然喪失了。</p>
<p>原來美國根據門羅主義以來的傳統而想獲得西半球的支配權，並且一相對於與防衛西半球有關的非洲和澳洲異常關心，現在英國因歐洲的局勢，到底無法顧到澳洲，因此把這個英國賜地的澳洲接收過來，正在想承繼它的遺產，所以爲了防衛澳洲起見，無論如何拚其死力企圖佔有所羅門羣島。於是在這方面正繼續着太平洋爭覇戰中最最激烈的戰爭。以去年八月七月八日九日的第一次所羅門海戰爲序幕，八月二十四日發生第二次所羅門海戰，八月二十五日起至十月二十五日止兩個月間，有以瓜達爾加納爾爲爲中心的激戰，九月十五日日潛水艇擊沉敵航空母艦瓦斯普號，十一月十一日至十四日第）二次所羅門海戰，十一月三十日倫加海面夜戰，一月二十九日三十日稜湟爾島海面海戰，二月一日至七日伊薩伯爾島海面海戰，三月二十七日的北洋最初的海上會戰，同月二十八日的新飛尼亞島奧洛灣攻擊等等，在這許多次大小海戰中，雖獲得了很大的戰果，但是日本自戰艦以下亦受相當視害。從這些事實看來，可見美國是怎樣在認眞地對日反攻，我日本於此必須萬衆一心，效法第一次第二次特別攻擊隊諸勇士忠勇義烈之精神，竭盡全力，以殲滅此等敵人的兵力，從速完全掌握太平洋的覇　，以期在大戰的完速。上有所貢獻。（如：譯自日本評論五月號）</p>

<h3>六月一日起　錢業實知統一票據</h3>
<p>銀錢業方面消息，自六月一日起，所有票據不再有「現鈔」與「劃頭」之分，合倂成爲「中倫券」票據。按本市流通票據，在戰前分匯劃與劃頭兩種，匯劃錢莊以匯劃票據授受爲主體，外灘銀行（即洋商銀行）以劃頭票據爲授受主體，華商銀行則匯劃與劃頭票據並用，匯劃票據隔日付現，劃頭票據當日付現。自二十六年秋季起爲安全金融，規定匯劃票據祗能同業轉帳，不准付現。匯劃與劃頭隨成兩種貨幣，後取消匯劃，因去年六月一日廢止舊幣，隨有「中儲券劃頭票據與「中儲券現鈔票據」兩種，實則兩種本質相同，並無差別，而票據交換所每日交換，分兩種貨幣，各行莊帳册亦分別記載。銀行界人士爲减少分別記帳麻煩，及各行莊每日劃頭軋多，現鈔軋缺，或劃頭軋缺，現鈔軋多等，多餘手續，同時便利各業授受起見，於本年三月間建議統一流通籌碼，主張將「中儲券劃頭票據」與「中儲券現鈔票據」合倂爲一，銀錢業負責方面，認爲此議可行，乃決定自下月一日起統一現鈔與劃頭，理成爲中儲券要據。因此在手續上可大爲簡捷。</p>

<h3>郵政人員的生活</h3>
<p>— 勞雁</p>
<p>讀過本刊紀小裳君的『銀行行員的生活』，百感交集。銀行行員的位職是「銀飯碗」，郵政人員的職位就一般的評價，恐亦不在『銀飯碗』之下。紀君每月收入九百元，以之養活三口之家，猶爲「是絕不可能的事了」，而且所列舉的各項開支，也盡是最簡單最經濟的，是「不能再省了』的。若以紀君的例子作尺度，來度量郵政人員的生活，其苦是不堪言狀了。</p>
<p>郵政人員的待遇，可分作上中下三等。上級人員約佔全人數百分之五，每月新津總數在一千元至一千三百元之間，其底薪爲五百元至六百元。中級人員約佔全人數百分之三十上下，每月薪津總數在七百元至九百元之問，其底薪爲一百元至一百五十元上下。其餘下級人員，每月薪津總數在四百元至六百元之問，其底薪爲五十元至八十元上下。平均每月六七百元者佔最大多數，而此六七百元且不能一次發給，須分作四次或三次發給，每次只能領取二百元上下。</p>
<p>郵政人員因聯務戰爲固定，作過十年二十年者爲數極多，其家庭人口平均總在五人以上，而且至少還有一二個學齡兒童，每學期學費亦須四百元上下。以此六七百元佻給五人之用度，每人平均只可用一百三十元上下尙不及紀君尺度之半，這不但「是絕不可能的事」，簡直『是不可想像的事』。</p>
<p>作副業又是郵政章程所禁止的，所以除了把可能變賣的變賣了，可能借到的借過了，以外，再就不知道還有甚麼方法可以補就，瞻念煎途，眞有不勝悵惘之感！</p>
<h3>稅務署調整鑛部稅率　照估價征百分之五</h3>
<p>財政部稅務署以礦產稅現行征收辦法，係照二十六年以煎核定，因礦產品估價與目前市價相差過鉅，亟應調整，現奉財政部核准各鑛商報納鑛產稅除華中淮南兩公司各鑛曁共他已核定佔價稅額各鑛外，不論何種鑛產品，在未經核定估價以前，一律暫照發貨票所載價値，以八折爲臨時估價，槪照稅率征收百分之五，自卅二年六月一月起實施，但征收機關如發見有發貨票所載價値不實在時，仍應隨時查明實在價格收稅云。</p>

<h3>From Fence-Sitting to the Asian Magna Carta</h3>
<p>— Su Sen</p>
<p>The Nanjing National Government has already gained formal recognition from thirteen countries worldwide in diplomacy. Simultaneously, it has secured the relinquishment of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions, initially advocated by Japan and followed by other related nations. On one hand, Japan has also laid the groundwork for defeating Britain and the United States in the Pacific. Under these two favorable circumstances, a portion of the Chinese populace still cannot fully align with the National Government or frankly cooperate with Japan in carrying out the Greater East Asia War. This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>While there are undoubtedly many reasons for this, the primary ones are that the Nanjing government still faces credibility issues among the people, and Japan's attitude has yet to fully satisfy the Chinese populace.</p>
<p>Half a year ago, at a certain banquet, I inquired about this reason from several leading Chinese friends. Their response was, ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××× But to this day, the Chinese people still cannot truly understand Japan's genuine intentions. If Japan were to treat China with brotherly affection, the Chinese would immediately rise to cooperate with Japan in defeating Britain and the United States. ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××× Therefore, the Chinese people currently cannot feel any interest in cooperating with the Greater East Asia War. Such words may be extreme, but they also frankly express the basic ideology of the so-called "fence-sitting" among the Chinese.</p>
<p>Half a year later, after this significant advancement in Japan's China policy, coupled with the realization by anti-Japanese troops in various regions that resistance was futile, leading to successive surrenders, the political power of the Nanjing National Government gradually strengthened. At the same time, due to favorable shifts in the international situation, a growing recognition of Japan's sincerity and a stronger belief in peaceful nation-building emerged. Consequently, many fence-sitters have indeed declared their stance. However, an atmosphere of suspicion and hesitation remains quite prevalent among a segment of the Chinese populace, especially the intellectual class.</p>
<p>Of course, Japan and the Nanjing National Government must bear considerable responsibility for eliminating this fence-sitting. First, the Japanese authorities should cease merely talking and must further act, thoroughly implementing a sincere China policy. The Nanjing National Government must also resolutely eradicate corruption among its subordinates to gain the trust of the people, adhering to the fundamental path of completing the Chinese revolution and striving for the freedom and independence of the Chinese nation, in order to gain the cooperation of the broad masses. However, the greatest effect still relies on the Chinese intellectual class itself initiating positive action to support and urge the government.</p>
<p>Originally, the so-called "intellectual class" mostly comprises individuals with high ideals but lacking in action. This phenomenon is a flaw in the character of intellectuals themselves. It is not unique to the Chinese intellectual class; intellectuals everywhere, at any time, share this trait. However, precisely because they are the "intellectual class," they must overcome this inherent character flaw and rise up with active engagement to salvage the crisis facing China and East Asia.</p>
<p>I have many friends among the Chinese intellectual class. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they consistently upheld the interests of the Chinese nation in various publications, publishing magnificent articles daily. But since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the progress of the Nanjing government after the concessions, a small portion of them has remained silent. Their sole justification is that they "have nothing to say." Some even reside in Nanjing but absolutely refuse to publicly reveal their names, let alone take responsibility. I consider this attitude inappropriate, regardless of the circumstances. I believe that as long as one rises up with active engagement as a prerequisite, then there will be a solution regardless of the situation. Moreover, the current Nanjing government is awaiting the cooperation of the people, and Japan will certainly not interfere in this kind of internal Chinese matter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at a certain banquet, a Japanese person said to a member of the Chinese intellectual class: China's East Asian League movement must, regardless of Japan's attitude, organize the masses, implement its principles, and begin large-scale movements. The matter of "hegemony" is not something that either Japan or China needs to argue about. The Chinese person said that under the current circumstances, China's East Asian League cannot be initiated and requires Japan to change the current state of China. In this way, their "political independence," one of their guiding principles, is merely hoping for help from others, and there is no talk of any movement. From this, one can see one aspect of the intellectual class's lack of action.</p>
<p>The issue of the Asian Magna Carta is being raised by a considerable number of people among the Chinese intellectual class. There are essays by Mr. Chen Fumu in newspapers and editorials in the Shen Bao. It is also often heard in private conversations. On the Japanese side, although it is not called the Asian Magna Carta, Mr. Ito Rokujiro, one of the highest-ranking officials of the Japanese East Asian League, has mentioned it. He said that Japan needs to show the countries and nations of East Asia the limits of what Japan demands from them. This motive and the Chinese intellectuals' advocacy of the Asian Magna Carta have the same starting point. Because the Chinese intellectuals' advocacy of the Asian Magna Carta, regardless of the reason, has its direct motive in requiring Japan to show the limits of its demands on China, and in drawing in other countries and nations to join, in order to mutually guarantee each other. This kind of attempt is perfectly legitimate from a Chinese standpoint, and there is absolutely no reason to reject it. Moreover, in principle, the people of all Asian countries should also support and rise up to promote its realization. If it can be realized, to stipulate the responsibilities and rights guarantees that each country and nation in Asia should bear, then the so-called fence-sitting will surely disappear naturally. However, in reality, it is "easier said than done"!</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Fumu raised the following questions in his lead article "The Question of the Asian Magna Carta" in the fifth issue of "China and East Asia":</p>
<p>(1) The Asian Magna Carta is indeed necessary in principle. But in what way should this Magna Carta be proposed? Should the authorities of the Asian countries immediately determine it? Or should the intellectual circles of the Asian countries first study and promote it, and then the authorities jointly determine it?</p>
<p>(2) On what principles should the content of this charter be based? Should these principles focus on practical aspects? Or should they also take into account ideological aspects?</p>
<p>The most difficult questions are indeed in these points. As for determination by the authorities of each country, under the current circumstances, the authorities of several countries may not be able to obtain the consent of their people. If intellectual circles first study and promote, and then the authorities jointly determine it, the time will inevitably be too long. If the principles focus on practicality, ideology cannot be taken into account; if they focus on ideology, practicality cannot be taken into account. This is the most difficult problem in the Asian Magna Carta. Taking a step back, even if all difficulties are overcome and an "Asian Magna Carta" is formally established, if the relevant countries and nations actually do not have the power to be autonomous and only want to rely on the power of others, letting others dominate them, then even a magnificent Magna Carta may not be realized. Isn't that the same as having nothing?</p>
<p>In the end, it is still necessary to expect the intellectual class to recognize the objective situation and transform the intellectuals' inherent defect of non-action, to rise up with active engagement, and to urge the government to maintain the dignity of the country, to represent and lead the people in striving for the freedom and independence of the nation and the country. Only when the government has this substance and this power can it talk about political independence or the issue of establishing an Asian Magna Carta. If the intellectuals remain fence-sitters and the country remains powerless, then political independence and other guarantees can only be hoped to be sent by others. There is no such easy thing in the world.</p>
<p>The past will never come again; this is true not only of time but also of all phenomena. Therefore, I want to repeat that as long as one rises up with active engagement, then there will be a solution regardless of the situation. I hope that many Chinese friends will rise up to urge the government, save China's crisis, and jointly defend Asia for us Asians.</p>
<h3>The Russo-Japanese War: This Newspaper's War Coverage 38 Years Ago – New Transcript from Old Newspapers (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>On the Significance of Japan's Victory (Published in this newspaper's No. 11538, Guangxu Year 31, Fourth Month, Thirtieth Day, corresponding to Friday, June 2, 1905)</p>
<p>Russia staked everything on its Second and Third Baltic Fleets. After more than half a month, they crossed the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and entered the Pacific Ocean, hoping to break into Vladivostok and engage the Japanese navy in a decisive battle to restore naval power in East Asia. Now, the main battleships are almost completely annihilated, and both commanders-in-chief are prisoners. Although the extent of Japan's losses is not fully known, its control of the overall victory can be predicted. This battle is the first major naval battle since the advent of ironclad battleships, the first major naval battle of the 20th century, and the first major naval battle between Europe and Asia. As for its impact on the overall situation in East Asia, I dare not speak of the distant future. Let me try to speak of the immediate effects.</p>
<p>First, it concerns the overall situation of Japan's naval and land battles. During the Sino-Japanese War, Russia, Germany, and France forced Japan to return the Liaodong Peninsula. Japan was extremely angry. After meetings of the ministers of the navy and army, it was ultimately decided that the navies of the three countries were beyond Japan's strength at that time, and that 200,000 troops were isolated in Liaodong. If naval power were lost, the situation would be irrecoverable. Therefore, Japan swallowed its pain and endured, and redrafted the terms of withdrawing from Liaodong. The situation today is no longer what it was then. The army in Manchuria is several times larger than in the Sino-Japanese War. The supply of all provisions, equipment, and weapons depends entirely on a single line of sea transport. Therefore, before Port Arthur was blocked, Japan did not dare to land a single soldier on the Liaodong Peninsula, fearing the navy's restraint and attacks. If the navy were to lose today, then from the Yellow Sea to the Sea of Japan, all would be within the sphere of Russian naval power, and Japan's maritime communication would be completely cut off. Although the Busan-Yizhou railway could be opened within the year, if the Tsushima Strait were choked by Russian warships, this railway would also be useless. The land gained by the Manchurian army last year through bloody battles would have its supplies cut off, and all previous efforts would be in vain. If the Russians were to dig deep trenches and build high fortifications to wait, the Japanese army would collapse without fighting. Therefore, Russia's naval defeat does not directly affect the army, but if Japan's navy is defeated, the army will also be defeated. Hence, the crisis for Japan in this battle is much greater than for Russia. Fortunately, in one battle, the enemy fleet was completely destroyed, bringing the prospect of peace closer. The impact on the overall war situation is imaginable.</p>
<p>Second, it concerns East Asia's commerce. Since the Russo-Japanese War began, commerce has not been significantly affected, except in the three eastern provinces. Even Japan's commerce last year did not show any signs of decline, which is because naval power was not seized by the Russians. A few days ago, there were reports that the Baltic fleet had reached the Yangtze River. Insurance prices for cargo exports in this port soared, and trade to Japan almost ceased. If the Russians had won this battle and gained control of the sea, then all ships traveling to and from China would be subject to Russian naval inspections, and the commerce of all countries in East Asia would be greatly hampered. Japan's commerce would cease, and its economy would be unsustainable even before defeat in battle. As for the Russians, their commerce is weak to begin with, so even if they lose naval power, they would not be immediately distressed. This is also why Japan's situation is more precarious than Russia's. Now, the battle of Tsushima is like the sudden clearing of clouds after days of overcast skies. From now on, merchant ships traveling to and from the Northeast can sail freely without hindrance, and Russian volunteer ships lurking in the mouth of the Yangtze River will also disappear and seek protection from neutral countries, which is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the division of victory and defeat between the two armies, some say it is due to the difference in the situation of the host and the guest, the fatigue and leisure; some say it is due to the difference in the speed of the two fleets; some say it is due to the difference in the skills of the naval soldiers; some say it is due to the quality of the tactics of the two armies. These are certainly true, but I believe that there is a most obvious and crucial reason for the victory and defeat of the two armies: one had the will to fight, and the other had no will to fight. The Japanese fleet, adopting a strategy of countering movement with stillness, had been guarding the Tsushima Strait for days, hoping for the arrival of the Russian fleet to fight. The Russian fleet, on the other hand, lingered and hesitated, concealing its movements to avoid the Japanese fleet's surveillance and aiming to break into Vladivostok. Therefore, when the two forces met, one was like a hungry tiger emerging from its den, and the other was like a cornered beast running madly. From the commander to the soldiers, the morale of the two armies was as different as heaven and earth. One wanted to fight, and the other did not want to fight. Is this also one of the reasons for their victory and defeat?</p>

<h3>Commemorating Japanese Navy Day: Lecture Held in Nanjing Yesterday, Attended by Thousands of Chinese and Japanese Officials and Civilians, Creating an Unprecedented Spectacle; Director Ren He and Advisor Teraoka Delivered Speeches</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) The 27th of this month marks the 38th Japanese Navy Day, and at a time when the Greater East Asia War is progressively victorious and the Japanese Navy has achieved great results, our Navy Department and Propaganda Department jointly celebrated Japanese Navy Day by holding a lecture and film conference at the Dawa Grand Theater on the evening of the 29th at 7:30 PM. Among those in attendance were Navy Department Director Ren He, Propaganda Department Vice-Director Guo, and thousands of officials and guests from various departments and organizations. After the conference began, the band first played the naval songs of both China and Japan. Propaganda Department Vice-Director Guo gave the opening remarks, followed by Navy Department Director Ren's speech, and finally, Japanese Navy Advisor Rear Admiral Teraoka gave a lecture. After the lecture, the Japanese Navy Band performed various famous pieces, which were exceptionally brilliant. The following films were also screened: (1) Hawaiian Film, (2) Malay War Chronicles, (3) Chinese Navy Construction. Each film was filmed on location, revealing the true situation of Chinese and Japanese naval activities and perfectly demonstrating the spirit of the two navies. They were particularly significant historical films. The audience was extremely excited, and the meeting did not end until around 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>Propaganda Department Vice-Director Guo's Opening Remarks</p>
<p>The main idea was that Western aggressive forces came east via three routes: one via the Siberian Railway southward, one based in India, northward via Singapore, and another based in the Philippines, advancing eastward and entering the home. In short, China was their overall target for aggression. On May 27, thirty-eight years ago, the Japanese Navy defeated the Baltic Fleet, blocking the southward aggression from the north. This victory was not just a victory for Japan alone, but the first victory for Eastern nations in breaking Western aggression. The result of this victory not only influenced the national psychology of Japan but also the national psychology of the entire East Asia. The self-confidence of the East Asian nations was restored, and the sense of self-awareness of the East Asian nations began to sprout. Because the East Asian nations had such confidence and self-awareness from that time onward, they knew that if they could strive to become strong, the East Asian nations would eventually be liberated from the aggressive forces. Therefore, they constantly fought against Britain and the United States. The outbreak of this Greater East Asia War is the total manifestation of this struggle and the total reckoning against British and American aggressive forces. The National Government recognizes that the Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation for East Asian nations and therefore resolutely participated in the war. Other nations have also ignited torches of anti-aggression everywhere. We firmly believe that in the near future, the British and American aggressive routes coming from the south will also be cut off in this war. The friendly nation's navy will exert even greater force in the Pacific to complete the Greater East Asia War and create a more glorious and great commemoration for East Asia.</p>
<p>Director Ren He's Speech</p>
<p>Today, the Propaganda Department and the Navy Department are holding this grand event to celebrate Japanese Navy Day. As the Minister of the Navy, I am very honored to participate with everyone. May 27 this year is the thirty-eighth anniversary of Japanese Navy Day. Looking back thirty-eight years ago, on May 27, Meiji Year 38 in Japan, the saintly General Togo led the Combined Fleet to intercept the Imperial Russian Expeditionary Baltic Fleet in the Tsushima Strait in the Sea of Japan. Under the command of General Togo, the Japanese naval officers and soldiers fought valiantly, destroying the Imperial Russian Baltic Fleet in one fell swoop, capturing 21 warships totaling more than 138,000 tons and capturing its commander. The greatness of the victory was unprecedented. The three biggest influences to the present are: (1) East Asia was able to preserve itself, (2) Japan's national power became increasingly prosperous, and (3) The Imperial Russian Navy was eliminated and has not been rebuilt to this day. The above two points are closely related to the interests of our East Asian nations. The third point has also influenced the victory of the Axis powers in today's German-Soviet war. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy has once again used its traditional spirit to cooperate with the Army and Air Force to defeat Britain and the United States, driving their centuries-old aggressive forces from the East Asian land. Now, on the 38th anniversary of Japanese Navy Day, all East Asian nations should share life and death and show solidarity. We remember that 38 years ago, General Togo encouraged his officers and soldiers, with the imperial country's rise and fall at stake. We must now understand that the rise and fall of East Asia is at stake in this Greater East Asia War. Thirty-eight years ago, the Japanese army and navy officers and soldiers, as well as the entire nation, had this spirit and therefore achieved victory. Therefore, we East Asians today should also use this spirit to strive for victory. Furthermore, our navy is on a new path and still needs a lot of guidance and assistance from the Japanese navy. I would like to sincerely celebrate the prosperity of the Japanese Navy and hope that our entire nation will recognize the emerging navy so that it can develop day by day and be able to jointly undertake the task of defending East Asia in the Pacific with the Japanese navy one day. This would be a blessing for China, a blessing for Japan, and a blessing for East Asia.</p>
<p>Advisor Teraoka's Speech</p>
<p>The Chinese Navy's National Government stipulates that April 1 of each year is Navy Day. This day is the day when the National Government established the navy, and April 1 of the 31st year of the Republic of China was also the first National Navy Conference Day. China took its meaning as the day of unifying the national navy, so it was designated as Navy Day. Japan also has the same Navy Memorial Day. During the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese Navy intercepted the Imperial Russian First and Third Pacific Fleets in the Sea of Japan and won a great victory. Therefore, Japan stipulated that May 27 is Navy Memorial Day. Since then, it has been commemorated every year, and the people recall the fighting spirit of the naval officers and soldiers of the past, all of whom are inspired and awakened. Today is the 38th anniversary, and the National Government is participating in the Greater East Asia War at this time, sharing life and death with Japan and heading towards the path of completing the annihilation of Britain and the United States. People from all walks of life in the Chinese capital have encouraged us in many ways, and we are endlessly grateful. From now on, we can only work harder to live up to everyone's expectations.</p>

<h3>The Battle of the Sea of Japan and the Battle of the Pacific</h3>
<p>— Kenwa Tominaga</p>
<p>(Continued from page 3 yesterday)</p>
<p>Currently, in the Pacific theater—especially in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea—a relentless aerial annihilation battle is unfolding day and night. The enemy's advances and retreats on Guadalcanal Island have transformed the naval battle into a struggle for bases. At least, we feel that the naval battlefield is no longer a vast expanse of sea, but rather a base defense war centered on bases, following the naval battle.</p>
<p>We often hear the arguments of the omnipotence of the air force, the uselessness of battleships, and the supremacy of base aircraft, which are very noisy.</p>
<p>The cries of enemy air raids on the Japanese mainland can also be heard from time to time.</p>
<p>Everyone believes that the Pacific war situation is at a crossroads. The battle for the Pacific islands is neither the direction of the future war situation, nor is the aerial annihilation battle a means of war. Air raids alone cannot end the war.</p>
<p>War has opponents, and armaments are ultimately relative. Here, we must recognize what strategies the enemy is using to adapt to reality, reverse the decline, and launch an offensive.</p>
<p>In the past six months, the battle situation in the Solomon Islands, although the United States has paid a great price, has not improved. On the contrary, Japan has followed the progress of the strategic situation and established a foundation for a turning operation. Roosevelt strongly argued about the failure of the operation, saying: "I don't want to attack Japan island by island," and boasted: "Using Chinese bases to bomb the Japanese mainland is the only way."</p>
<p>However, this air raid on Japan is the last resort for the United States. The United States is well aware that the scorchification of the Japanese mainland is not easy. The answer given by the commander of the Army Air Force at the time when Soong Mei-ling went to the United States to request the strengthening of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is clear evidence.</p>
<p>"The United States is now dispersing its forces to various battlefields, except for China. If troops are to be sent to China, there is no other way than to use the Burma Road, and air transport is unreliable due to thunderstorms in summer and cold weather in winter." In the end, he concluded, "In short, that kind of thing is impossible."</p>
<p>Needless to say, the United States naturally attaches great importance to bombing Japan from the Chinese mainland. This can be inferred from the recent separation of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing into the Fourteenth Air Force. Of course, this method cannot frustrate the national will and make Japan surrender.</p>
<p>Using a large air force to carry out continuous air raids is considered the most effective method, whether starting from the northern Caucasus, Midway Island, or the sea. This plan is supported by some advocates of air force omnipotence, but in order to reverse the decline before today, their plan is to first preserve and strengthen the remaining important strategic bases, and then gradually force the battlefield closer to Japan's occupied territories and the Japanese mainland. Therefore, they attempted to acquire all the British territories in the Pacific as the price for the Lend-Lease Act. New Guinea, the New Hebrides, and New Zealand have in fact become powerful American air bases. The cost of their preparation alone has reached 700 million yuan. It goes without saying that Australia is a powerful base. In the South Pacific front alone, we estimate that nearly 2,000 aircraft are equipped with air power.</p>
<p>For the air force to launch a decisive attack, it must cooperate with the navy, especially in the case of an attack on Japan, which is extremely difficult to bomb across the ocean. This is the strategic thinking of the United States. The guiding spirit of the United States is that controlling the ocean with aircraft and surface ships is the greatest condition for achieving victory. In order to turn enemy territory into a battlefield, sea control is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Therefore, a large shipbuilding plan with sixty aircraft carriers as the main body is underway. In any case, a large navy and a large air force are indispensable. Then, it is possible to carry out a real air raid on Japan using the air force. This is the plan of the United States.</p>
<p>They often claim to be bombing Japan, but this is just an excuse before the large-scale preparations for a counterattack on Japan are completed. According to their views, there must be a great naval battle that has a decisive impact on the war situation.</p>
<p>Whether this is the day when Japan and the United States will fight to the finish, let's leave it aside for the time being. However, if the starting point of the counterattack is completely lost and the fleet is completely annihilated, that is defeat.</p>
<p>This war, as they say, will be decided in the Pacific. Whether or not we can control the ocean will depend on the outcome of this battle. In the past and today, this situation has not changed.</p>
<p>This war is a choice between survival and destruction. The mission that is assigned to us is that we can only adhere to and implement the spirit of annihilation in all fields. Our 100 million people are now shouldering the burden of regaining a glorious battle result like the Battle of the Sea of Japan. We should clearly recognize that the rise and fall of the nation and the crossroads of survival and death are at hand. (Xiang: Translated from "Modern" May issue) (End)</p>

<h3>German-Soviet Tank Battle in the Kuban Swamps: All Soviet Troops Attacking Bridgehead Repelled</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th, Central News Agency: According to Eastern Front news, since the Soviet army launched a general attack on the Kuban bridgehead on the 26th, it has encountered a brave counterattack by the German army. By the evening of the 27th, its forces, including ten infantry divisions and five tank brigades, had been annihilated and defeated. On the morning of the 28th, new troops were successively dispatched to launch a general attack. The two armies then launched a major tank battle in the swamps at the mouth of the Kuban River. According to front-line news, the German authorities attach great importance to the development of the battle situation because the Soviet army is using the Kuban bridgehead as the prelude to the summer offensive. British and American news sources also say that the Soviet army's offensive is aimed at regaining the Kuban bridgehead, and then recovering the Crimean Peninsula via Kerch to restore the new rights of the Black Sea. This is a countermeasure to deal with the Axis forces' offensive in the Balkans, so they also attach great importance to this situation. Due to confusing news, the truth of the battle situation on the 28th is impossible to determine. However, it is reported that the Soviet army has lost a large number of planes and tanks. If the battle continues like this, and the German army uses its flexible encirclement tactics, the Soviet army is in danger of repeating the defeat of Kharkov. Therefore, they are extremely anxious about this.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>The German Headquarters announced on the 28th that the Soviet army on the Kuban bridgehead front launched an attack on the 27th under the cover of tanks and air force units. After being intercepted and attacked by the joint efforts of the German air and land forces, all of them have been repelled. In addition, the German air attack teams and reconnaissance teams are quite active, and the other fronts are extremely stable.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Kuroda Succeeds as Supreme Commander of the Philippines</h3>
<p>Manila, 29th, Central News Agency: The Japanese dispatch army to the Philippines announced on the 29th regarding the change of the supreme commander of the Japanese dispatch army to the Philippines that Lieutenant General Shizuichi Tanaka, the highest commander of the army in the Philippines, has been transferred to an important position, and Lieutenant General Shigedo Kuroda has been appointed to succeed him. He will take office today. According to Kuroda, the supreme commander, he graduated from the Japanese Army University, and served as a military attache in the UK, chief of the conscription section of the Ministry of the Army, commander of the military attache unit in Germany, director-general of the Education Directorate, acting director-general of education, and other important positions. In July of the 17th year of Showa, he was transferred to an important position, and has remained there until now.</p>
<p>Kuroda Issues Statement on Taking Office Manila, 29th, Central News Agency: The newly appointed Lieutenant General Kuroda, the highest commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines, issued a statement to his subordinates upon taking office, the gist of which is: "The Philippine war ended on May 7th of last year, after the fall of the Corregidor Fortress and the unconditional surrender of the entire American-Philippine army. It has been a year since then, and the situation of security and construction has reached a satisfactory state. This is the result of the united efforts of our military and civilians under the guidance of the former Supreme Commanders Homma and Tanaka, and the sincere cooperation of the Philippine officials and people. I am deeply gratified by this, and I am determined to expand and develop the achievements that have been made today. Japan has now made a resolute decision to engage in a war of annihilation against Britain and the United States in the Asian continent and the Pacific. We are conducting this historically rare large-scale war, and we will not stop until we succeed. Since the start of the war a year and a half ago, we have reaped enormous war results and laid the foundation for final victory. The enemy once shouted loudly that 1943 was the year of counterattack, but its offensive was crushed by us on the Indian front at the beginning of this year. This proves that we have maintained a state of operational initiative at any location. And I would like to encourage all of you to bravely advance."</p>
<p>Manila, 29th, Central News Agency: The newly appointed Lieutenant General Shigedo Kuroda, the supreme commander of the Japanese dispatch army to the Philippines, arrived at the airport here by plane at 12:12 today. The heads of the Japanese dispatch army to the Philippines, the commanders of various units, and many other officials of the executive government all went to the airport to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Fight Bravely on Attu Island: Continue to Inflict Damage on American Troops</h3>
<p>Changchun, Argentina, 29th, Central News Agency: It has been more than two weeks since the US military landed on Attu Island. Although the US Navy Department has repeatedly issued hopeful communiques, the Japanese army has continued to fight bravely with recruits, and as a result, the US military seems to have suffered great damage. The US Navy Department issued a communique on the 28th stating that on May 26, US military units in the North Pacific engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army in a mountainous area. The US Navy Department's war situation communique has not mentioned the situation after the 26th. According to its published communique, American Liberator heavy bombers, Mitchell medium bombers, and Lightning fighters have cooperated with the US Army. A US military spokesman also stated that the situation on the island is such that the Japanese soldiers are fighting tirelessly, so both sides have launched hand-to-hand combat. This is already an acknowledgment of the heroic spirit of the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>British and American Military Representatives Continue to Meet in Washington</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th, Central News Agency: According to a Havas report from Washington, the British and American military delegations in Washington met again yesterday to finalize the details after the results of the Rochambeau Conference. The Washington press corps was dissatisfied because only a 122-word statement signed by President Roosevelt was issued two days ago, 16 days after the Rochambeau Conference. Therefore, they asked the authorities to at least give a hint of the specific results of the meeting, but the authorities remained silent, saying that they themselves did not know the details.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Forces Plan to Land in Europe</h3>

The anti-Axis powers' main battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers are now concentrated in important strategic locations and are closely monitoring the Axis naval operations in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. The detailed military plan that the anti-Axis powers are about to launch has also been drafted.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Australia</h3>

<h3>Naval Spirit (4): The Admirable Helmsman</h3>
<p>— Genichiro Inokuma</p>
<p>This is the story of a Lieutenant 〇〇 that I have known since I was a child. When 〇〇, who had just departed on a campaign in the Pacific War, was on his way home after the enemy was defeated, enemy aircraft continued to relentlessly pursue them, and unfortunately struck the warship he was serving on. His comrades around him fell one by one, some were injured, and he also suffered a fatal injury in his lower abdomen. The orderly who ran up in time pointed and said, "I'm fine. Go and help the others first!"</p>
<p>As he said this, he pressed hard on his wound with one hand, while the other hand held the steering gear. He stood like a lofty giant rock in front of his subordinates.</p>
<p>Wishing he could steer out of the bombing range a moment sooner, he never put his gradually cooling body in his mind. In his heart, there was only the sacred, selfless spirit of a subject of the Emperor. One after another, the wounded were taken away for treatment, and he smiled as he watched his comrades being carried away. He guarded his post until the very end, and fulfilled the duties he was in charge of in a very satisfactory manner. After about an hour and a half, he completely dragged the warship to a safe area, and then he collapsed beside the steering gear and passed away.</p>
<p>This story was heard from his younger brother. The sacred sense of responsibility to protect one's post with one's life, in addition to a stronger and more memorable life, this spirit was completely respected by everyone from the captain to the soldiers. It can be said that it is the supreme naval spirit, worthy of our national compatriots to worship. (Excerpt from Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Military and Pacific Domination</h3>
<p>— Benda San</p>
<p>More than a year has passed since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, and Japan is now exerting all its efforts to complete the great war. There is no need to reiterate that this war broke out because the United Kingdom and the United States attempted to place East Asia under their oppressive control and dominate the Pacific Ocean to satisfy their delusions of arbitrary exploitation.</p>
<p>The various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia have long been victims of the violent acts of Britain and the United States. Their cultures have been destroyed, and their lives have been plunged into a state of utter misery. Furthermore, they enticed the Netherlands and Australia, and incited Chiang Kai-shek to advance their ambitions. They either strengthened their armaments around Japan or implemented economic blockades, imposing all kinds of threats on Japan. However, Japan exercised as much restraint as possible, striving for a peaceful resolution of the situation. But they, therefore, regarded Japan as easily manipulated, leading them to increase their arrogant and rude attitude, trampling on the spirit of the Empire's grand ideal of "Hakkō ichiu" (all the world under one roof). They not only attempted to render Japan's years of efforts to stabilize Greater East Asia futile but even sought to endanger Japan's very existence. Therefore, for the sake of the permanent peace and happiness of Greater East Asia and for self-defense, the Japanese military resolutely rose up, thus initiating a great war centered on the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Originally, world culture originated on the Mediterranean coast, and the Roman Empire, which dominated the Mediterranean Sea, achieved hegemony in Western Europe. Later, the stage shifted to the Atlantic Ocean, and for a time, Spain reached its golden age. However, due to the lack of solidity in its policies, it was soon suppressed by England. For over a century thereafter, it was the era of the Atlantic, and England was its hegemon until today. In the 20th century, the stage shifted for the third time, becoming the era of the Pacific Ocean. Competition among the great powers, centered on the interests of the Pacific, became extremely fierce. It is only natural that the country that gains the upper hand in this competition will prosper, while the country that does not will decline. Now, as our country is embarking on the sacred task of revitalizing Asia and beginning a major leap forward, we are encountering this unprecedented and momentous situation. Success or failure depends entirely on whether we can secure control of the sea (including control of the air). In other words, the completion of control by the Japanese Navy over the sea in necessary areas is the foundation and core of Japan's national development.</p>
<p>According to the records in the "Kojiki" and "Nihon Shoki," the Yamato people have been a maritime people since ancient times, destined to develop on the sea and dominate the sea. It is said that Susanoo-no-Mikoto, the younger brother of the ancestral deity Amaterasu Ōmikami, received the imperial decree of "ruling the sea plains" from Izanagi and Izanami and devoted himself to the dominion of the sea. It is said that at that time, the sea route was distant, and the land and sea were connected. Hoori (Hikohihodemi-no-Mikoto) went to the "Palace of the Sea God" by sea route and brought back the "Tide-Ebbing Jewel" and the "Tide-Flowing Jewel," and with the power of these two jewels, he was able to control the ebb and flow of the tides. The many legends of the founding gods being close to the sea and conquering the sea are sufficient to illustrate the fact that our distant ancestors had already developed on the sea as a maritime people. Since the Eastern Expedition of Emperor Jimmu, Japan's maritime development has experienced periods of prosperity and decline. However, during the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, the Japanese Navy first gained control of the sea, followed by the Army's continental operations, which completed the final objective. The Japanese Empire, with the Pacific Ocean as its backdrop, can be said to have had the Pacific Ocean as the foundation of its life since the founding of the nation.</p>
<p>The Pacific Ocean is located east of Asia and west of America, covering an area of 180.21 million square kilometers, accounting for half of the world's oceans. Speaking of its origins, Europeans generally believe that Magellan (Ferdinand Magellan, 1480-1521) was the first to discover the Pacific Ocean. He discovered the Philippine Islands in 1521. However, before this, the Portuguese had already arrived in the Pacific Ocean from the Indian Ocean, using Goa in India as a base, conquering Java and Malacca, and trading with Guangdong, China, which was in 1517. Later, in 1543, they also visited Tanegashima in Japan. After Spain incorporated most of South America and Central America into its territory, it entered the Pacific Ocean from the east and occupied the Philippine Islands, using Manila as a base to place Borneo, New Guinea, the Ladrone Islands, the Caroline Islands, the Solomon Islands, and other places under its control, which was in 1571. By the 17th century, the colonial policies of Portugal and Spain had greatly alienated the indigenous people, and the Netherlands took advantage of the opportunity to enter. Gradually, the Dutch seized the territories and commercial rights of Portugal and Spain. In 1609, they also began trading with our country, establishing Batavia in Java as a base, seizing all the islands of the South Seas, and even temporarily counting Taiwan as their territory. On the other hand, the British established the East India Company in 1600, entered the Pacific Ocean, and also began trading with Japan in 1609. As for the Japanese, there were also many who traveled overseas and developed, such as the "Wokou ships" that roamed the West Pacific Ocean and the "Shuinsen" (Red Seal Ships) authorized by Taiko Hideyoshi. However, after the Shimabara Rebellion, the Tokugawa Shogunate prohibited Japanese from traveling overseas, and foreign trade was also prohibited, except for the Dutch and Chinese. As a result, the Japanese presence in the Pacific Ocean completely declined. In the 18th century, the British, due to their involvement in India, did not have time to attend to the Pacific Ocean for a while. However, after the pacification of India, they began the colonization of Australia. Russia entered the Pacific Ocean from Siberia in the 17th century. During the reign of Catherine II, they explored the seas near the Kuril Islands and occupied most of them. In 1860, they also requested trade with Japan. By the 19th century, the development of Australia by the British had greatly progressed. On the other hand, they obtained Singapore in 1824, Hong Kong in 1842, and leased Weihaiwei, establishing the largest presence in the Pacific Ocean. In 1900, they granted Australia federal self-governance. Russia's management of Asia greatly advanced in the 19th century, building the port of Vladivostok. After the Sino-Japanese War, they fostered their strength in Manchuria, leased Port Arthur and Dalian, and attempted to extend their influence in the Pacific Ocean. France, since the mid-19th century, devoted itself to the economy of Vietnam, obtaining Saigon in 1859, followed by Cambodia and Annam as protectorates, and also obtaining Tonkin. It also obtained the area south of the Mekong River from Siam, establishing its influence in one corner of the Pacific Ocean. Germany began to pay attention to the Pacific Ocean from the end of the 19th century, dividing New Guinea with Britain and the Netherlands, and then occupying the Bismarck Archipelago, the Marshall Islands, and leasing Jiaozhou Bay. It purchased the Mariana Islands and Palau Islands from Spain, and divided the Samoa Islands with the United States, becoming a force in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The United States has always maintained the Monroe Doctrine. Since the end of the 19th century, it has adopted imperialism. In 1898, it annexed Hawaii and obtained Guam and the Philippine Islands in the Spanish-American War, extending its influence in the Pacific Ocean. From the end of the 19th century, the Pacific Ocean entered the era of regular ship navigation, and trade became increasingly prosperous.</p>
<p>Our country developed rapidly after the Meiji Restoration. After the Sino-Japanese War, it acquired Taiwan. In the Russo-Japanese War, it prevented Russia from extending its influence into the Pacific Ocean and obtained the southern half of Sakhalin. It further annexed Korea and joined the ranks of the great powers, establishing its influence in the North Pacific Ocean. In 1914, when World War I broke out, our country jointly occupied the German colonies in the Pacific Ocean with the United Kingdom. Our army and navy also captured Jiaozhou Bay and eliminated German influence. After the restoration of peace, among the former German colonies, the islands south of the equator went to the United Kingdom, and those north of the equator went to Japan as mandated territories. Thus, the Pacific Ocean after the war had special and significant political implications due to the relations between Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which surrounded it. This situation developed until the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Originally, the national policy of the United States was developed based on the advocacy of naval officer Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914). In one of his famous works, titled "What is National Policy," he said: "National policy is the policy that a nation is determined to support and implement with force when necessary, and in the case of the United States, it is always the Monroe Doctrine and the Open Door Policy in China. However, in the Monroe Doctrine, there is no need to initiate military force, but in order to prevent the destruction of the balance of power in the Far East, a formidable naval force is necessary." The then-President of the United States was greatly inspired by this teaching and decisively occupied the Philippine Islands in the Spanish-American War, using this as a base to ensure the right to speak on the China issue and extend into the Chinese market. This was entirely due to the teaching of Mahan, who declared that "the possession of the Philippine Islands is like building a bridge in the Pacific Ocean." Building this bridge in the Pacific Ocean meant advancing towards China, with the goal of dominating the Pacific Ocean. The construction of a great navy designed for this purpose was the so-called "Stark Plan," which involved a historically unprecedented and vast expansion of armaments with a total expenditure of $12.7 billion—to be completed by the end of 1946, with 35 battleships (including those of the 55,000-ton class), 20 aircraft carriers, 88 cruisers, 378 destroyers, and 180 submarines, totaling 701 ships, with a total tonnage of 3.5 million tons. Later, due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the grades were somewhat changed due to the rapid increase in aircraft carriers, but the expenditure on shipbuilding continued to increase. However, the Philippine Islands were defeated within months of the start of the war, and the bases in the Western Pacific had been completely lost.</p>
<p>Originally, the United States, based on the tradition since the Monroe Doctrine, wanted to gain control of the Western Hemisphere and was particularly concerned about Africa and Australia, which were related to the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Now that the United Kingdom, due to the situation in Europe, could not take care of Australia, it was taking over this British territory and was trying to inherit its legacy. Therefore, in order to defend Australia, it was desperately trying to occupy the Solomon Islands. Thus, the most intense war in the Pacific struggle for hegemony is continuing in this area. Starting with the First Battle of the Solomon Islands on August 7th, 8th, and 9th of last year, the Second Battle of the Solomon Islands occurred on August 24th. From August 25th to October 25th, there were two months of fierce battles centered on Guadalcanal. On September 15th, a submarine sank the enemy aircraft carrier Wasp. The Second Battle of the Solomon Islands occurred from November 11th to 14th. The night battle off Lunga Point occurred on November 30th. The sea battle off Rennell Island occurred on January 29th and 30th. The sea battle off the coast of Isabel Island occurred from February 1st to 7th. The first naval battle in the North Pacific occurred on March 27th. The attack on Oro Bay, New Guinea, occurred on March 28th. In these many large and small naval battles, although great results were achieved, Japan also suffered considerable damage from battleships downwards. From these facts, it can be seen how seriously the United States is counterattacking Japan. Our Japan must unite as one, emulate the spirit of loyalty and valor of the special attack units in the first and second campaigns, and do everything possible to annihilate the enemy's forces, quickly and completely seize hegemony in the Pacific Ocean, in order to contribute to the rapid completion of the great war.

<h3>Citizens Should Carry Their Citizen ID Cards</h3>
<p>In the past two days, pedestrians on the roads and passengers on public vehicles have been frequently checked by police officers. Therefore, those who have not obtained their Citizen ID cards should quickly declare their identities to the police station in their respective areas to obtain their Citizen ID cards to avoid difficulties when traveling. The Citizen Residence Certificate Issuing Office in the Western District of Shanghai has begun to expedite the issuance of Citizen Residence Certificates that have already been applied for but have not yet been issued.</p>
<h3>Passengers Leaving Shanghai by Train Must Obtain Certificates from the Police Station</h3>
<p>People residing in the two concessions of Shanghai, regardless of gender, holding Resident Identity Certificates or Citizen ID cards, are not allowed to board the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou trains after inspection. However, residents living in the city area who hold Residence Certificates issued by the Municipal Police Bureau are not prevented from boarding trains. Therefore, general travelers, whether traveling to the Suzhou-Jiaxing area or Zhenjiang, have been flocking to the Fourth Section of the Municipal Police Bureau in recent days to apply for travel permits. When applying, in addition to providing a personal photo, they must also pay a stamp tax and paper fee totaling three yuan and provide a guarantor. It is reported that the Residence Certificates issued to city residents have the seal of the Military Police Headquarters, while the Resident Identity Certificates issued to residents of the two concessions do not have the aforementioned agency seal.</p>
<h3>Filial Piety Lectures; The Ba and Jia Youth Department Dispatches Personnel to Various Theaters to Promote</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Ba and Jia Youth Department, in order to promote the inherent virtues of our country, began promoting the Filial Piety Movement two weeks ago. They invited prominent figures in Shanghai, Mr. Yao Minghui and Mr. Zhang Yipeng, to first lecture the department members on the meaning and methods of filial piety, and emphasized that the department members should first practice filial piety themselves and set an example for the youth of the city. It is learned that the Propaganda Section of the Department has dispatched propagandists to various theaters this afternoon to give short lectures on filial piety to the audience before the screening of each feature film. It is hoped that all sectors of society will respond to this initiative, thereby promoting the ethical concepts of citizens and rectifying social customs. The theaters to which propagandists have been dispatched include Grand Theatre, Majestic Theatre, Cathay Theatre, New Shanghai Theatre, Paris Theatre, Shanghai Theatre, Lido Theatre, Great Shanghai Theatre, Dahua Theatre, Jinmen Theatre, Nanjing Theatre, and Pingan Theatre.</p>
<h3>Sympathy for the Famine-Stricken People of North China; All Sectors Enthusiastically Contribute Aid; The Employees of the National Reserve Printing Plant Generously Donate 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The donations for the famine-stricken people of North China have been met with a continuous response from all sectors. Various agencies, companies, and firms have also begun fundraising. Caring for the famine victims and performing acts of benevolence and righteousness serve as models for other regions. This newspaper, after receiving the donations collected on behalf of the public, will publish the list of donors the next day to ensure transparency. Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Wang Zhuoqing of the Engineering Department of the Central Reserve Bank Printing Plant, stating: "Having read your newspaper's call to assist in the North China disaster relief, our plant's employees are filled with sympathy. We will do our best to contribute a small amount and have jointly donated 10,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. We respectfully submit the funds and a list of donors and request that you verify receipt and disclose it." The sincerity is truly admirable. It is hoped that various industries in Shanghai will follow suit and that those with strong financial resources and a generous spirit will enthusiastically contribute to relieve the suffering of the disaster-stricken compatriots and plant seeds of blessing for future generations. With these two good deeds combined, we cannot help but pray sincerely for the disaster-stricken people of North China.</p>
<h3>Donations Collected by This Newspaper Will Be Deposited in the Bank Daily</h3>
<p>The donations collected by this newspaper for the North China disaster relief have received an enthusiastic response from readers, amounting to a significant sum. Before the official establishment of the disaster relief organization in the city, these funds will be deposited into the bank daily starting next Monday, with the interest accruing to the donations. This newspaper will not misappropriate a single cent to reflect the readers' enthusiasm for donating. We hope you will take note and continue to donate generously.</p>

<h3>Zhang Jinhai Case: Trial Postponed, Important Remarks by President of Special Court No. 2</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Special Court No. 2, due to the failure of the French Concession's Administrative Bureau to complete its investigation into the tragic death of Zhang Jinhai, has repeatedly requested postponements. The hearing, which was rescheduled for public trial on the 31st of this month, is due to take place tomorrow. As the public is deeply concerned about this case, the reporter visited President Chen of the court to inquire about the proceedings in advance. The President made the following important remarks: "After the investigation by the Procuratorate of this court was completed, the facts were clear. However, in order to take into account the Sino-French agreement, the French Administrative Authorities were still required to prosecute. Unexpectedly, they repeatedly requested postponements, which hindered the progress of the case. After serious negotiations with the French Judicial Advisory Office, they were ordered to prosecute on the 31st of this month to facilitate a public trial. However, today, the Judicial Advisor, Xia Bo, came to the court and stated that only a portion of the defendants could be prosecuted, which is obviously unfair. It is deeply regrettable to hear this. However, in order to safeguard the legal rights and interests of the people in the concession, this court immediately argued on the basis of reason that all defendants suspected of committing crimes should be prosecuted according to the law. Moreover, the case has already been thoroughly investigated by the Procuratorate of this court, so it is not appropriate to arbitrarily exonerate them. A fair verdict will naturally be made after a lawful trial in the future. We will postpone it again until June 4th, hoping that the French authorities will respect Chinese law and prosecute all the defendants in the case for a public trial."</p>

<h3>Three-Year Industrial Plan</h3>
<p>The national government is actively implementing all policies to stabilize people's livelihoods and improve welfare. It has recently decided to focus on water conservancy, road construction, and urban development as the core of a three-year plan. If it can be realized, the construction of a new China will definitely make epoch-making progress. The Ministry of Construction has already conducted research and discussion on the plan, and the detailed content is determined as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Water Management: Opening up the new canal in northern Jiangsu, which can increase farmland by about 5 million mu; reclaiming and dredging the Dong Taihu area, which can increase cultivated land by 300,000 mu; at the same time, repairing the Wan River and Huai River to prevent flood damage.</p>
<p>(2) Highway Construction: Building major roads between Shanghai and Nanjing, and important roads for national defense; at the same time, supervising local governments to strive to complete the road network.</p>
<p>(3) Urban Construction: Revitalizing important cities, realizing stable people's livelihoods, establishing new national life demonstration halls, actively promoting the new national movement, establishing building materials manufacturing plants, and building citizen housing, etc.</p>
<p>After the National Government joined the war, it urgently needs to establish a wartime system in order to adapt. It is hoped that such concrete measures can be actively promoted so as to achieve great results. (Shuo: Translated from the Continental News of May 29)</p>
<h3>From June 1st: Unified Notes for Qianye (Money Exchange) Businesses</h3>
<p>News from the silver and money exchange industry: From June 1st, all notes will no longer be divided into "cash" and "clearing," but will be merged into "Zhonglunquan" notes. According to the circulating notes in this city, before the war, there were two types: remittance and clearing. Remittance Qianzhuang mainly accepted and issued remittance notes, the Bund Bank (i.e., foreign banks) mainly accepted and issued clearing notes, and Chinese banks used both remittance and clearing notes. Remittance notes were cashed the next day, while clearing notes were cashed on the same day. Since the autumn of the 26th year, in order to ensure financial security, it was stipulated that remittance notes could only be transferred between the same industry and were not allowed to be cashed. Remittance and clearing subsequently became two types of currencies. Later, remittance was canceled. Because the old currency was abolished on June 1st last year, there were two types: "Central Reserve Bank Clearing Notes" and "Central Reserve Bank Cash Notes." In fact, the two types were the same in essence and had no difference. However, the clearing house exchanged two types of currencies every day, and the accounts of each bank and Qianzhuang were recorded separately. In order to reduce the trouble of separate accounting, and the excess procedures of each bank and Qianzhuang having too much clearing and not enough cash, or too much cash and not enough clearing, etc., and to facilitate acceptance and issuance by all industries, banking personnel suggested in March of this year to unify the circulation of chips, advocating that "Central Reserve Bank Clearing Notes" and "Central Reserve Bank Cash Notes" be merged into one. Responsible parties in the silver and money exchange industry believed that this proposal was feasible, so it was decided to unify cash and clearing from the first of next month, and to manage it as Central Reserve Bank notes. Therefore, procedures can be greatly simplified.</p>

<h3>Economic Bureau to Strictly Ban: Unlicensed Stock Traders</h3>
<p>Stock traders in this city have applied to the Municipal Economic Bureau for registration one after another. After the Bureau verified and issued licenses, fifteen companies including Xinli, China, and Yongchang have officially resumed business since the 19th of this month. However, the remaining stock traders who have not obtained licenses are still operating as usual. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Director Wang of the Bureau to inquire about the situation. According to Director Wang, the stock traders who have not been approved and have applied to the Bureau for registration are being closely investigated. Those who pass the review will be issued licenses one after another. Those who do not have a registration license have not obtained a legal status and are absolutely not allowed to operate privately. In order to protect the safety of investors and maintain the interests of the stock traders who have obtained licenses, the Bureau has now established close contact with the Concession authorities. Those unlicensed stock traders who are still operating privately will be strictly banned and will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>Public Life</p>
<h3>The Life of Postal Workers</h3>
<p>— Lao Yan</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Ji Xiaoshang's "The Life of Bank Employees" in this publication, I was filled with mixed feelings. The position of a bank employee is a "silver rice bowl," and the position of a postal worker, in general evaluation, is probably no less than a "silver rice bowl." Mr. Ji's monthly income is 900 yuan, and it is "absolutely impossible" to support a family of three with it, and the listed expenses are all the simplest and most economical, and "cannot be saved anymore." If we use Mr. Ji's example as a measure to measure the life of postal workers, their suffering is unspeakable.</p>
<p>The treatment of postal workers can be divided into three levels: upper, middle, and lower. Senior personnel account for about 5% of the total number of people, and the total monthly salary is between 1,000 yuan and 1,300 yuan, with a base salary of 500 yuan to 600 yuan. Middle-level personnel account for about 30% of the total number of people, and the total monthly salary is between 700 yuan and 900 yuan, with a base salary of about 100 yuan to 150 yuan. The remaining lower-level personnel have a total monthly salary of between 400 yuan and 600 yuan, with a base salary of about 50 yuan to 80 yuan. The average of 600 to 700 yuan per month accounts for the largest number, and this 600 to 700 yuan cannot be paid in one lump sum, but must be paid in four or three installments, with each installment only receiving about 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Because postal workers have fixed duties, there are many who have worked for ten or twenty years, and their average family population is always more than five people, and at least one or two of them are school-age children, and the tuition fee for each semester is also about 400 yuan. Using this 600 to 700 yuan for the expenses of five people, each person can only use about 130 yuan, which is less than half of Mr. Ji's standard. This is not only "absolutely impossible," but simply "unimaginable."</p>
<p>Working part-time is also prohibited by postal regulations, so besides selling what can be sold and borrowing what can be borrowed, I don't know what other methods can be used to make up for it. Looking ahead, I really feel overwhelmed!</p>
<h3>Tax Office Adjusts Mine Tax Rate: 5% of Estimated Value</h3>
<p>The Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance has determined that the current method of collecting mineral taxes is based on the examination and approval in the 26th year. Since the estimated value of mineral products differs too much from the current market price, it urgently needs to be adjusted. Now, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, the mineral tax declared by each mine business, except for the Huainan companies in Central China and each mine of the two companies and each mine with a tax amount determined by occupying the price, regardless of the type of ore product, before the estimated value is determined, all shall be temporarily based on the value stated on the delivery note at 80% as the temporary estimated value. The tax rate is 5%. It has been implemented since June 1, 32nd year, but if the collecting agency finds that the value stated on the delivery note is not real, it should still investigate the real price at any time and collect taxes.</p>
