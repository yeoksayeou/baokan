<p>社評</p>
<h3>投機囤積與物價問題　一個迫切的建議</h3>
<p>物價高漲的原因，依經濟的原理講，一是物資的缺乏或减少，供求上失其平衡，促成物價上漲；二是通貨膨脹，直接使貨幣購買力低落，形成物價上漲。這是自然的主因。但物價因此上漲的程度，應與這主因的程度相符合，且必定是漸進的。</p>
<p>因此，多數人主張增加生產，以解決物資缺少問題；緊縮通貨，以挽救膨脹問題。道極正常的根本的辦法，我們當然贊同。可是，就目前上海的實况，我們先要問：</p>
<p>（一）物資究竟缺乏吾？</p>
<p>（二）通貨究竟膨脹否，</p>
<p>（三）就算物資　缺乏，通貨膨脹的話，那末，缺乏與膨脹的速度，與物價上漲的程度比較，究竟　符合吾？</p>
<p>第一個問題，欠假定以「食」「衣」「用」三種物資爲例，「食」「衣」「用」三種物資爲例，「食」，目前除戶口米外，不足的仍可源源獲得，我們「飯改粥」，「三碗改吃二碗」的事實是有的，而爲了糧食不够而活活餓死的，究竟還少。更有人佔計過，以江浙兩省的京杭滬三角地帶內，糧食產量與人口需要，不但可以充分的自給自足，尙有餘糧供給軍用，至於滿足。「衣」，也有人估計過，上海的紗布存嚴，足敷華中十年的消費。「用」的一項，就是指生活必需的日用品，以肥皂爲例，據說原料最不易獲得，但傳聞某一銀行的囤積，的有一萬箱，而事實上中等人家日用品多有相當數目的儲備，墩目也很可觀。</p>
<p>我們雖則提不出精確的統計數字，但根據近乎事實的推測，我們敢說上海的物資，尤其是「衣」「用」兩項，缺乏不算嚴重，總比重慶政權統治下的各地好得多。</p>
<p>第二個問題，我們已經一再聽過財政當局的宣告，通貨有充分的準備金，絕無膨脹的現象。我們當然信任政府，同時也希望政府不使通貨膨脹，所以，我們也敢說通貨不算膨脹。</p>
<p>第三個問題，我們假定以去年六月廢止舊法幣時的物價爲例，「食」的米黑市（現已回小）漲五倍，「衣」與「用」，平均漲十倍左右，這個上漲程度，是否與物資缺乏與通貨增發的程度相符合？我們更敢說，絕對不符合。物資上漲，已經脫離了經濟原理，脫離了供求自然率的軌道，而如「脫繮之馬」的飛躍了。</p>
<p>那末，何者造成此脫軌的惡現象的呢？無疑是「人爲的投機囤積」。有了囤積，充分的物資，變成缺乏：供求相調，變成失衡，刺激物價，拔步飛騰；通貨也不幸，蒙受了膨脹的不白之寃！這個殘害民生的罪過，眞是罄竹難書！</p>
<p>我們旣然算淸了這筆造成高物價的帳，是全在投機囤積的囂張。於此，我們不能不認爲政府過去的放任，不用政治力量　　，以致夜郞自大，不堪收拾。而人民則敢怒叫不敢言，一面紛擾於「藏鈔票日虧，不如買貨物」的心理，造成像吉田東祐氏論物價文中：「貨幣購買力低落與物價騰貴的惡循環公式，是民衆自己抬高物價，却自己爲其後患而苦惱」的可憐局面。這一點，民間的領導份子，未能振臂一呼，以社會力量，加以制裁，也應負一部分責任。</p>
<p>現在政府旣己關切此問題而下令澈査，我們人民期望之深，決非言語所能表達。而觀察旬日間的發展，或許政府認爲有種種窒礙，就此打住。一方面我們人民如果仍持觀望態度，那末，物價問題的前途，將益發不可收拾，而最受切膚之痛的，仍是大多數的老百姓。</p>
<p>我們鑒於前車之覆，再不能因循坐誤了。對於政府的澈査，獻言已盡，我們不願再置討論的重點於「澈底！不澈底！」上面。今天我們以更大熱忱，呼籲民間團體，自動發揮有效的社會制裁的力量，以與投機囤積者清算。</p>
<p>因此我們建議：</p>
<p>（一）民間團體，如上海市商會，上海市民福利協會，上海經濟研究會，同時請友邦日本方面的上海工商會議所等，組織類似「物價問題對策硏究會」的一種組織，邀同中日經濟學者及有卓見的企業家，經常討論對策，隨時徵集人民意見，供獻政府採納實施。</p>
<p>（二）由同上團體，「檢舉投機囤積」，歡迎市民舉發，經過公允調査確實後，公告社會，不論商號或個人，一致請求政府予以沒收或停業，以期收到社會制裁的效果。</p>
<p>（三）由同上團體，硏究增加生產，自原料以至成品，各部門，各細節，均有詳細周密而能够實行的合理辦法，以求洽本。</p>
<p>最後，我們認爲取締投機囤積，必須先從上海做起，因爲它是全國的經濟中心，如果上海做得好，則其他都市，聞聲響應，同一步調，必能同樣成功。因此，這一工作的意義，實甚重大。民間團體，尤當出以全力，爲大衆而服務，願急起圖之。</p>
<h3>訪滿任務完成　周佛海特使將返國　今後中滿兩國邦交益臻敦睦　對完遂大東亞戰爭緊密提携</h3>
<p>新京十七日中央社電　我國訪滿特派大使周佛海自九日抵此以來，備受滿洲國朝野熱烈歡迎。茲已任務完畢，定於日內即行返國。周特使此次訪滿，使中滿邦交更臻緊密，良以周特使曾訪張國務總理，武部總務長官，李外交大臣等，促膝懇談，並協議中滿兩國協力完遂大東亞戰爭方策，使兩國在戰爭之指導上，取得緊密之聯繫與提携；並與滿洲國經濟部，交通部，興農部等各大臣及滿洲國中央銀行正副總裁等交換意見，對於謀中滿兩國經濟之提携，以强化大東亞戰力一事，雙方意見已完全一致。周特使曾赴哈爾濱，奉天，撫順，鞍山，大連等地實地考察滿洲國之重要產業開發狀况，足資爲中國經濟建設之借鏡，故周特便此次訪滿意義至爲重大。</p>
<p>大連十七日中央社電　我國訪滿特派大使周佛海自本月九日赴滿訪問以來，曾赴滿洲國各地視察，頃已任務完畢。周特使曁隨員一行已於十六日下午七時十五分抵達大連，當晚下榻於大和飯店。</p>
<p>新京十七日中央社電　我國訪滿特派大使周佛海爲謀促進中滿邦交及强化經濟合作起見，奉命於九日首途抵大連，在滿逗留約近旬日，歷訪新京及各政治經濟中心地區，頃已完成使命返國。按周氏此次訪滿，在中滿國交史上含有劃時代之意義，對於今後兩國國交之促進以及振興我國經濟等任務，含義尤爲深重。周氏抵滿後，並會視察滿洲國經濟建設狀况，與滿朝野懇談。周氏此行衆認確已充分完成其目的。茲簡述周氏訪滿期內之動熊如次：十日上午晋宮覲見滿皇，午後與張國務總理會談；十三日在哈爾濱；十四日在奉天與官民進行懇談，披瀝强化中滿兩國緊密提携之決意；復於十二日視察吉林松花江豐滿水閘；十四日視察昭和製鋼廠；十五日視察撫順煤礦等重要設施。按豐滿水閘乃滿洲產業開發之一大原動力，爲世界大發電所之一，滿洲產業開發成功之大紀念塔；又昭和製鋼廠於大東亞戰爭爆發後，鋼鐵生產獲得預期以上之或果，完成對日協力之光業記錄。此次周氏訪滿，除對於今後中滿國交有重大發展外，兩國之經濟關係，尤將有飛躍之進步，故中滿國交與經濟方面行將劃一新紀元。</p>
<p>旅順十七日中央社電　我國周特派大使訪旅順時，曾赴日俄戰爭之激戰地，東拉冠山北堡壘視察日軍苦鬭之餘跡。親睹被炸毀之鋼骨堡壘，及數日內不顧生死掘成之進攻墜道，深爲　　。旋操流利之日語謂：「今見旅順之戰跡，深知日軍之强盛，目前我等爲使大東亞戰爭戰勝，所有之東亞人，應念及旅順之聖地。日俄戰爭，爲東亞民族解放之烽火，此地實爲大東亞黎明之發祥地。」繼之赴旅順博物館參觀，由該館今井館長熱心引導，巡覽館內各地，並隨時加以說明。周特使亦深爲感歎，，最後並特題：「文物之精華」五字贈之，以作永久紀念。</p>
<h3>渝方組織即將崩潰　人力資源均缺乏　僅有產業憶陷窘境　從業人員相繼離散</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　據此間朝日新聞社廣州特電稱：渝方最近曾屢次頒布確保人力之各種法令，力謀確保人力資源。猶憶過去蔣介石無限人力，縱戰爭如何延長，亦可因無限之人力，可繼續對抗；然其後因日軍之進攻作戰，和平區域日漸擴大，推進運輸路綫，又悉被截斷，遂使渝軍在質量兩方，俱吿低下，同時僅有之各種產業，亦陷於崩潰或不振之境地，產業從業員自亦因而流散，且因國民政府之參戰；渝方已喪失抗戰名目，其統制下之各地人民，逃入和平區者，乃日益增多。凡此數因，均使渝方人力漸感不足。目前渝方統治下之人口，共的一萬五千萬，佔中國人口總數之三分之一；此項人口之分佈，並非如和平區內之密集都市，從事產業，而却散布新疆，靑海，甘肅等省之廣大地域內，因此欲圖動員或徵用，事實上幾不可能。在此情形下，渝蔣抗戰所恃之人力資源，目前亦已陷於窘迫之境。然渝方對此又將作何對策乎？據最近所接消息，渝方刻正忙於檢討各項問題；首爲兵力問題，目前渝軍雖號稱三百萬，渝方宣傳謂將準備動員五百萬乃至一千五百萬之兵員，但於過去與日軍在華中華南之作戰中，渝軍死傷被俘投誠及逃亡者，已爲數極夥，故在今日，是否仍保有三首萬之兵力，實屬疑問。此雖在渝方當局對此亦深感苦悶。蔣介石於本年一月以米，即動員學生，從事官傳，以期增進一般民衆服務兵役之觀念，至三月十四日，遂頒布新徵兵令，其中規定凡十八歲至四十五歲之男子，一律須服兵役，同時規定凡未人伍之靑年，自十八歲起至廿五歲以內者，須受全部軍事敎育及遊擊戰之訓練，並規定與此年歲相同之婦女，亦須從事軍事補助服務，此亦即爲渝方首决動員婦女之法令，故渝方對於編組軍隊及補充兵員之困難，於此當可窺見一斑。次爲產業勞力問題，渝方於去年三月二十九日曾公布「國家總動員法」，以謀擴充武器資材及生產力，及確保人力；去年一月之「十二全會」中，亦議決「勞慟服務案」，期以勞力補資金及資材不足；本年一月再頒布勞働法，企圖增進工人福利，以鼓勵工人工作興趣、並即大事宣傳；三月初又令其所屬「各省政府」實施固定工資，資方之對於勞働階級實施懷柔政策，無非爲一種策略；同時在二月中頒布之勞働服務法之規定，不論男女，一律須於每日服役一小時，一年內　滿二百五十小時或連續服役三十日，其不願服役者，得以現金代役。又渝方治下各地之技術人員，目前亦至感缺乏，　　據悉，現有美籍工程師三百人正從事開發產業，各大學專門舉校內亦注重培養技術人材，觀此可知渝方之戰時政策，僅在技術方面亦已處於無法再建之境地。渝方雖力謀增强勞働服務之觀念，對於因大東亞戰爭爆發後由馬來及緬甸等處逃赴內地之華僑壯丁，則强迫人伍，其餘亦强迫服役，技術人員更無一倖免。渝「國民黨中央執行委員」梁寒操最近曾赴西北觀察，彼謂將來擬移一億人民開發西北。一方面關於移民之直接指導機關，則根據去年十月行政會議之決議，任命「僑委會委員長」陳樹人，「國民黨海外部長」劉維熾，「蒙藏委員會委員長」吳忠信，「軍委會副委員長」馮玉祥等爲開發西北移民委員，並命令各省實施「開發西北移民法案，」規定凡十八歲至四十五歲身心健全之人，經當局認爲係無職業者均須移往西北墾植，凡此種種，皆足表示渝方對於目前最切實之勞働問題及將來之確保人力對策，正大感煩惱，逾方過去向以擁有無限人力而自誇，但現已陷於不得不力謀確保人力之窘境，此亦即爲其即將崩潰之重要原因。</p>
<h3>魯日軍戰果</h3>
<p>濟南十七日中央社電　日軍各部隊前於本月十日在魯省西北部楊宋家附近曾擊潰共匪四百餘，十四日復向西方轉進，圍攻恩縣南部渝軍李文奎及龍洪海所部約四百人，猛擊五小時後，則將其主力完全殲滅。是役渝軍遺屍二百九十餘，李文奎屍體亦在內，又被俘五十八人，並截獲武器彈藥等甚夥。</p>
<p>開封十七日中央社電　孫良誠將軍自去年三月二十二日參加和平陣營以來，於茲巳歷一載。於此一年期內，其所部第二方面軍在隴海綫商邱北方，魯省西南部之曹縣，單縣，定陶各方面所獲戰果如次：交戰次數一二一次，交戰渝共軍兵力一二〇〇〇人，渝共軍棄屍三七三四具，被俘二九一人；此外截獲品計有輕機槍二十七，步槍八四五，同彈藥一二八四三，手溜彈八七二及其他軍需品甚夥。</p>
<h3>華北經濟界動態　山西產業會社　創立一週紀念</h3>
<p>山西產業株式會社，負指導開發山西寳藏之責。四月一日爲其成立一周年之期。創立之初，統攝十二家大會社所屬軍管理工廠三十六家，及其從業員日人一千三百八十九人，華人一萬五千七百七十一人，在綜合的計劃下，從事開發山西。該會社除繼總經營原有之製鐵，煤，製粉，製紙，電氣，紡織，水泥，窰　，機械製作，皮革，火藥製造，烟草，火柴，採木，曹達工業等各業外，並開發與此有關之資源，在嚴重時局中，常產業兵團之任。創立之初，曾遇相當困難，但於一年之短期間，終吿克服，奠成今日之强固基礎。此實由於指導者之得人所致。</p>
<p>山西地　　源，偏於一偶，南部運城地區，拔海三百公尺，中部太原地區，拔海七百公尺，北部五台地區，拔海在一千數百公尺之上。故其所產農作物，南部爲小麥，棉花，中北部以雜　爲主。加以全省三分之二爲山岳地帶，故對地面資源，不昨有過奢期望。省內現狀，僅足以維持自給自足</p>
<p>反之，地下資源，山西不愧於寳庫之名。煤，鐵，石骨，石灰石等蘊有可驚之埋藏量。開發此無盡藏之地下資源，爲目前途行戰爭，建設大東亞過程上之急務，故期待甚殷。山西產業會社管轄下各工廠鑛山，生產數量極爲可驚，惟其詳細尙不得而知。</p>
<p>煤　大東亞共榮圈所埋藏之全部煤量，山西省占其半。有人稱達一兆二百億噸，一般估計寫一千二百億噸。此　量實三十五倍於滿洲國之埋藏量。此對大東亞共榮圈之將來，大爲有望。共榮圈南北資源之交流納入正軌時，山西寳庫之煤及其他無限之地下資源，業由山西產業常局者之大計劃下，進行準備矣。</p>
<p>山西產業會社之民間資本爲三千萬圓，總數爲一億圓。社長河本大作氏，下有常務重事四人，董事二人，監事二人。常務董事矢野信彥氏在該會社之創辦時，出力不少，實爲此大產業丘團所應永矢勿忘之　勛。（太原電。翔：譯自四月八日西部每日新聞）</p>
<h3>華北交易統制總會成立</h3>
<p>華北　易總聯合會第三次定期大會，於七日午後一時起舉行於該會會議室，參加者有該會所屬三十一團體之代表。</p>
<p>報吿事項　十七年度（卽卅一年度）之事業計劃，原天津及靑島之輸出入配給組合聯合會，業已改組，以各地爲支部，另於東京，新京，上海設辦事處，於京城，大連，張家口，山海關設派遣員事務所。</p>
<p>審議事項　華中業已設立全國商業統制總會。本會旣爲華北交易統制之中心機關，並爲適應日本對華新方針，强調中日合作起見，華北貿易總聯合會應改稱爲華北交易統制總會。</p>
<p>決定事項　（一）十八年度（卅二年度）之事業計劃。（二）本年事業計劃之歲出歲入預算案，歲入以辦理統制之手續費爲主，再由官廳補助。原於天津，靑島徵收之統制手續費，由總會一併徵收。（三）決定所屬州一團體之會費，賦課稅額，及徵收方法。（四）選任改正名稱後之職員。（五）統制手續費略予增加。</p>
<p>又北平日本大使館經濟部長管波，於會議席上宣稱：因日本對華方針之轉變，今後在經濟方面將由中國自主，　　北以華北交易統制總會爲中心，謀統制交易。尤以華中華北之交易，應尊事中國方面之自主性。在對日貿易上，一部分商品，如有可能，亦應委讓於中國方面。（北平特　——翔：譯自四月九日西部每日新聞。）</p>
<h3>華北華中物資　交流益見圓滑</h3>
<p>出席三月下旬舉行於南京，上海之華中華北匯兌費會議事畢回北京之北京大使館事務部畏梅北，六日會見記者團，發表該會議所作之決定如决：</p>
<p>會議由南京大使館召集，自　十五日起之二日間討論滙兌問題。自二十七日起之二日間討論交易問題。本會議分食糧，煤，棉花，其他四小組　分別開會。另於上海冉開籌備會。原來國府與華北政務委員會因儲備券對聯銀券之關係，使華中華北亦經濟上未能構成整個集團，而二者間之交易亦圓滑欠，會議結果，今後將盡力設法打開現局，使兩地域之物資交流圓滑化，因此，華中將大量供給華北最感需要之小麥，豆粕等食糧物資。惟華北雖供給煤及其他以爲補償，但尙有相當入超。至其決算方法，亦經商酌決定。根據物資流動之根本方針，今年對匯兌決算上之不平衡，將聽其存在，決算兼用儲備券與無匯兌二種方法。儲備券決算部分之重要物資，以不平衡數額之半，作儲備銀行供給華北之放款，以作決算手段之一。因此，華中華北間交易之躍進，可拭目以待。（北京電，翔：譯自四月八日西部每日新聞。）</p>

<h3>突尼西亞東北英美軍　侵入軸心陣地未逞　兩軍戰鬥方酣陣地數度易手　法叛軍現遣軍向邦杜發推進</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　據德國通訊社消息，星期三四兩天，艾森霍華部隊，在突境東北，屢次企圖侵入軸心陣綫，經德義軍隊頑固抵抗，陣地一無變動，前綫英方最後消息，證實安特森將軍統率之英第一軍，曁北區季勞叛軍，苦戰方酣，北部山地，德義軍反攻頗烈，將英軍擊退，甲貝爾盎高處，雙方隨得隨失者再，據昨晚英方最後消息，則昨晚尙在英軍手中，卑惹北部山區，反軸心軍於四月十四日猛烈攻擊，冀打破軸心陣地，及晚，該最重要陣地，仍在德軍之手。德手溜彈兵與義軍駢肩作戰，於四月十三日將反軸心軍攻破之數處，修補完善，在斯役中，俘獲反軸心軍數百名，反軸心戰鬥機與大砲均不能收效。據反軸心方面消息，法叛軍派遣隊正向邦杜發方面推進，圖直達突尼斯，雙方爭奪卡回安與蒲阿來達兩村間之公路頗爲劇烈，同時英軍在南部襲擊德前進部隊數决，致奏效甚微，英第八軍刻正在盎非達維爾附近建立陣地，據該軍戰地記者謂，蒙高茂萊將軍在彼處正遭遇重大之困難云。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十七日中央社電　綜合北非前綫消息，班吉亞東方及梅傑茲厄爾巴勃兩地區之反軸心軍，十六日於猛烈砲擊後，展開總攻，班吉亞方面，軸心軍奮勇抵抗，結果予英軍及法叛軍以極大損害，而將其擊退。又於梅傑茲厄爾巴勃西北方，捷貝朗地區兩軍，亦展開激戰。軸心軍曾一度被優勢之蒙高茂萊軍制壓陷於被包圍之危險境遇，然經運用巧妙之機械化戰鬥，形勢又轉爲有利，乃於十六日晨，開始猛烈反攻，綜合以觀，十六日之戰鬥，反軸心軍完全歸於失敗，軸心軍似將利用戰局之主動性，展開猛烈反攻云。</p>
<p>都靈十七日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社消息，此間史丹拍報，就突尼西亞戰況評論謂，該處戰局之鹿死誰手，現在雖難逆料，然軸心軍作戰範圍，已較小於前，而陣勢鞏固，軍力亦較敵方爲强，所用軍器亦較前此爲優良，後方交通有辦理完全之鐵路網爲之維持。按軸心軍刻下活動之區域，係於去年十一月佔據得來，德義軍隊無疑地頗能增强其防禦綫云。</p>
<h3>各地海港設備破壞英軍供應破感困難</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　據海通社軍事特派員稱，自星期四正午至星期五正午之二十四小時中，突尼西亞局勢，並無變動。南部北區英第八軍，顯然尙未完成其砲隊之集中，自埃爾拉眠之役後，蒙高茂萊將軍在每度大規模攻擊之始，必先作急續射擊，但此次欲堆有大量軍火，以供急續射擊，頗有困難。蓋加勃斯斯法克斯及蘇薩等處之海港設備，已被軸心軍撤退之前，加以激底破壞。故英第八軍之一切供應，皆須由陸路移動，即經由沿突境東海岸，有許多大曲折之唯一海岸公路，其所歷途程，自馬列斯　綫北面之英第八軍最後供應根據地起，至蘇　以北之地區，計四百公里以上。英軍雖擁用多量之摩托車輛，但欲運輸大量之軍火，以供開始新攻勢，則必需相當時日，英第八軍之遲遲未回恩斐達維爾之軸心陣地，作大規模之攻擊。其主要原因，或即在此。但此項延緩，大槪僅係短期間的，現時蒙高茂萊將軍所部，僅有小規模之突擊部隊攻擊及作偵察突擊，以冀試探南部地區軸心新陣綫之實力，在橋頭堡，西部戰綫，有較大之戰鬥活動，但目前，亦不能謂有大規模之攻擊，懂係局部之戰鬥而已安特森將軍之目的。顯係一則牽掣德軍，二則冀圖獲得有利之出發點，以繼續其攻勢，但在星期四日安氏此項計劃，仍無成就，雙方所劇烈爭奪之傑貝爾奧安納（在梅傑茲埃爾巴勃之西北）及貝加以北之高地，仍在德軍手中。同時在布亞拉達東南地區，英第一軍右面　翼作戰之法叛軍，亦遭德軍反攻，被迫退却，至更遠在突境西部戰綫之軸心軍，尙未在任何一處被迫而有使用後備作戰之必要。</p>
<h3>庫班橋頭堡激戰中　蘇軍損折極爲慘重　唐納資德軍擊退猛攻之蘇軍</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　昨晚此間公布，蘇軍在星期四日庫班橋頭堡之激戰中，損折坦克車旅團全部，及至少五個聯隊，故蘇軍在過去數天中之損失德額，的爲三個師團。蘇方曾以數聯隊之衆，及多數鐵甲車，進攻在山地與河堤之德軍陣地，但蘇軍祖克車在最前綫，即被集中之平射砲所遏阻，被迫轉向，其所掩護之步兵，多喪身於德方機關槍掃射之下，蘇軍一日之中，屢次進攻，皆受重創而退。德空軍對於防守陣地，厥功甚偉，羅馬尼亞，斯洛伐克及克羅地亞之機隊，亦皆加入作戰。在此大規模空戰中，共擊落蘇機五十八架，尙有八架，則被高射砲及機關槍擊落。</p>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　德軍當局宣稱，唐納資地區德軍，曾於十六日兩度猛攻蘇軍，業將蘇軍擊退，並斃敵七百七十人，俘虜百餘人，又截獲軍械及子彈甚夥。北部方面德軍，亦砲轟列寗格勒重要軍事工廠區域，及船廠地帶，有數處均起火延燒云。</p>
<p>芬京十七日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社云，芬蘭最高指揮部昨午公報稱，過去二十四小時中，芬蘭突擊部隊，曾在加萊利亞地峽東段，侵入敵方陣地，並轟毀其堅强防禦工事，敵軍旋卽施行反攻，但毫無效果，受創而退。另一部衝至戰塲之蘇軍部隊，亦遭芬軍砲隊轟擊，卽行潰退更東區域，芬軍經一小時餘之激戰後，將蘇方突擊隊之猛攻擊退。</p>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　德國普報駐瑞典京城訪員聲稱，芬蘭之能從事總力戰爭，完全賴其人民之特質，芬蘭一旦參戰，即被迫動員其國內之男女兒童，無分職業階級與年齡，皆不能避免此種作戰之經騐，使其人民留深刻印象，永難磨滅，德國爲以聯盟資格支持芬蘭之唯一國家。</p>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　東綫德軍，現已開始使用最新式之坦克車，其名稱爲「虎」。蘇軍當局，亦承認該項新式坦克車之攻擊力，至爲强大。據十六日德報載，該項新式坦克車之作戰情形稱，德軍前在比爾哥洛地區作戰時，使用最新式之「虎」坦克車，初則與蘇軍坦克車進至極近距難時，始突然開始出擊，在二三分鐘內，即使蘇坦克車起火，又於距蘇軍坦克車僅三公尺時，即以其巨砲猛攻，轉瞬即將蘇軍坦克車之砲塔舉毀，其他蘇坦克車見此車後，正擬分別回竄，「虎」坦克車卽以其最大速力，緊追蘇車坦克車隊，乃將其悉數殲滅。</p>
<h3>日軍戰力增强　澳印刮目相看</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　日軍於太平印度兩洋方面所施之壓力，日益增强後，澳政府西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部，駐印英軍司令部等，因此一致發出呼籲，咸窘於日軍之進攻，因而使反軸心各國對日本戰力，今重加評價之趨勢。倫敦新聞記事報從軍記者梅特朗，自南太平洋某港發出之報道中，謂日本之戰力，開戰伊始數字雖悉爲彼等之臆測，但其結論所謂日本戰力已吿增强，此點實殊堪注視。其報道略謂，據最近消息，日本目前擁有船舶數量達七百五十萬噸，香港新嘉坡泗水及馬尼拉等地之造船所，因過去破壞並不澈底，故恢復極易。過去一年間此項造船所均已復工，且收有相當成績，其正確數字雖不得知，但至少必擁有七百五十萬噸。據此可知開戰時，吾人對於日本國力似估價過低，對於日本擁有船舶之數或亦不免估價過低。又開戰以來，由美國爲主所發表擊沉日本船舶噸數，其數字或未必正確，其空軍方面亦然。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十七日中央社電　澳政府及西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部，近曾屢次發表遭受日軍威脅之聲明，茲此事在美政界方面，果已形成重大問題，且漸有涉及麥克沃塞之進退問題。據華盛頓電稱，反軸心軍總司令部，對於西南太平洋反軸心軍陸軍司令白萊未及麥克沃塞等所發之聲明，亦已加以反駁。</p>
<h3>日陸軍技術會　二屆議會開幕</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日陸軍技術硏究會第二屆會議，已於本月十四日在此間開會，到軍部方面及民間科學人員等一千三百餘人，連日分別發表關於軍械，防空機械，被服，糧食，衛生，獸醫，航運資材，建築以及軍需品等八種，硏究報吿達三百餘件，充分發揚日本科學界之重大使命，貢獻於增强戰力，尤至深且重，茲該會於今日討論完畢後，　已圓滿閉幕。</p>
<h3>阿留申羣島　日兵力增强</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　據紐約消息，轉載自阿拉斯加美國某根據地之消息稱，阿留申羣島之日　軍，較以前更爲强盛。日軍在吉斯加島及阿都島之砲位，自三月初以還，已大有增加。</p>
<h3>英渝互推諉　緬戰失敗責任</h3>
<p>廣州十七日中央社電　據此間獲悉，此次英印軍於印緬邊境日溪北方戰敗後，渝英軍閥乃互相推諉責任，英方認此次敗戰，因渝軍於雲南國境方面未展開協力作戰所致；而渝方則非難英印軍作戰無準備，以致狼狽敗退。渝軍發言人十五日會見記者團時，並公然指出奪回緬甸已不可能，並就日方任命河邊中將爲緬甸方面最高指揮官一事談稱：日方此次更迭司令官，必將展開新作戰，故對今後日軍行動，須加以戒備。</p>
<h3>反軸心公佈　美澳軍傷亡數</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　據墨爾缽電訊，澳洲反軸心軍總部，昨日公布，截至四月一日止，美澳兩軍在新幾內亞之損折人數，共計一〇，五三一名，其中包括美空軍人員與陸軍兵士，及澳軍之死傷及失蹝者。</p>
<h3>美在太平洋戰綫　所處地位不利</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城十七日中央社電　據華盛頓電，關於增强西南太平洋戰綫空軍問題，麥克沃塞及澳洲政府，已與華盛頓軍首腦部間，形成對立狀態。美議會方面對此亦極軍視，參院民主黨議員疆多拉氏，曾於十六日談稱，余最近擬在議會中，喚醒重視太平洋戰况推移之注意，美軍現於太平洋戰綫所處之地位，未必有利，余對於該方面之危機，實不容忽視。</p>
<h3>德國「飛行師團」調往大西洋沿岸</h3>
<p>蘇列克十七日中央社電　瑞士塔特報特派員電稱：希特勒已將「飛行師團」從東線調至法國，現大西洋墻垣之後，駐有實力雄厚之摩托化，步兵與坦克車部隊，富於流動性，可用於敵軍突襲而入防綫後方之仟何地點。就此等師團許多士兵獎章觀之，可知彼等乃來自東綫之有經騐戰士，彼等旣抵法國境內，德國西方防務之戰鬭力，乃大爲增强云。</p>
<h3>日本工業　飛機製造所訪問記</h3>
<p>這是擁有很古的傳統的製造木製練習機的工塲。木製飛機的製造，始自大正十一年間，二十年來，經過不斷的努力，造成了像今日這樣優秀的飛機。一切的利澗置之度外，惟祖國利益並技術之進步是求，這才造成眞正日本的技術，而道技術的成就，才有今日的飛躍。</p>
<p>「最初，見到親手所造的飛機飛上天空時的那種歡愉啊！」</p>
<p>這裏，從各府縣，各職塲，匯集了無數的人，進入工塲工作。職員，工役中自動組織成的交通挺身隊，揮着手，吹着口笛，在整理機件。在這中間，有一位鬢髮已霜的老紳士，特別引起人們的注意。走近去訊問時，才知道這就是場主岡田保决郞所長，假使有一天不見所長的蹤跡，工友們就要終日若有所失，假使有時因病休假，全工塲獲悉之後，如工塲中即可以聽到職員們的憤憤之聲。</p>
<p>「周圍的人們，爲在麽都似乎心不在焉的樣子呢？」</p>
<p>爲了所長，赴湯蹈火，在所不辭，這一種日本工員之久遠的强烈的傳統，於此埋下了驚異的根幹。</p>
<p>進門，建有一座聖上親臨後的紀念館。在此紀念館之前，戰士們加緊向職塲的本分奮進，從事增產。並列一排的各工塲，雜奏着興奮的生產交響樂，電氣變壓所發出了似獅子般的吼聲。聳立於晨風中的考勤率競爭的成績標板，與揭示於工塲內的職札，（姓名的號數籤）都顯示出一種決戰態勢。全員到差的名札之間，雜有表示出征之星狀的符號。</p>
<p>每個人在懸掛職札的時候，心的深處，聽到了在遙遠的戰綫上，親手製成的飛機翱翔於天空的聲音。參拜了祭祀於祠堂中的戰死者照相之後，不禁悲憤地把木槌重重地敲下，借此發洩湧上心懷的鬥志。</p>
<p>機械的配置，材料製品的搬運，檢査，採光等，積多年來的歷史與經騐，都有最上等的設備。不僅此也，因爲燃料的不足，在黑暗中摸索工作，戰十們却以爲是無上的安慰。直至回宿舍入浴之前，始行拋棄工作。</p>
<p>朝晨的酷寒，使指頭似被針刺般疼痛，但都顧不得這些了，而且斷不許有搓手取煖的時間。敵人正在虎視耽耽地企圖轟炸日本本土。飛機担負着祖國安危的重大責任，假使戰士們怠忽職責，後患何堪設想，這是第一的整備綫啊！</p>
<p>然而，這是母須作杞人之憂的，每年在正二月中例趨低下的生產能率，自去年九月起，開始直綫上昇了。正月的情形，使合社的首腦部張口　　。二月，更爲之驚愕不止，物資愈用愈缺乏了，生手的學習工，愈見增多了，然而奇蹟却是不斷地出現，完全推翻了過去的常識，這就是日本眞正的所以强的緣故！這是一種神秘的力！</p>
<p>爲了使奇賾有更多的重演，我們要求戰士們用捨身的精神，報效祖國。敵人是猶太的資　本，美國的物資　與盎格魯撒遜民族三者的綜合，是魔性的惡鬼。</p>
<p>所以那夜我在第三菱誠宿舍中，與戰士們毫無忌憚的推誠相與地爲了增多奇蹟而所談的話，拿來轉吿國人，希望大家對生產陣營有更深的認識與協力。</p>
<p>情感的激動，是增產運動的原動力。從故鄕出發時所受的熱烈的歡送，使自然而然地成爲一個健壯的戰士。各府縣當局，鑒於學習工人們所負責任重大，對於人選問題，不是需要更大的協力嗎？最初入塲工作的學習工，可視爲各府縣對時局認識的測騐器。有一個不良份子混入，不僅使夥伴們同蒙其恥，且也妨害了國家想多造一架飛機的要求。</p>
<p>某工員從村中出發時，並沒有受到盛大的歡送與激勵。所以他不知道自己所担任的工作的重大，於是有一次稱病歸鄕。但故鄕的村落中，與他在鄕時的情况有很大的變化了。已經覺醒到時局的重大了，他很慚愧地回到工塲來，之後，就成爲一個模範工員。</p>
<p>某村，不時有國民學校中的學童們寫慰問書前來存問，那村的工員見到從故鄕寄來的書信之後，他們的工作能率即有顯著的提高，而儲蓄金也增加起來了。</p>
<p>諾蒙亨事件中生還的勇士，也入所工作來了。他人所的時候，首先向製造飛機的前輩致其感謝，然後默默地獨自打掃三間房屋。他以百戰餘生的激情，默然移向於埋首工作，而他加入的那中隊成續即見良好，不久，他便擢升爲中隊長。</p>
<p>但漠然不覺到時局的重大性，因而不努力於本分工作者也決不是沒有。從事生產增强的戰士們，五時起床，八·九時左右始行回宿舍休息，他們的辛苦，即在前綫交戰也不過如此。生產增强的鎖鏈，維繫住這樣的社會，全體國民打成一片，激勵他們，使他們感動，於是，奇蹟乃不斷地顯現。</p>
<p>祗要經過一度的激勵演購，他們的能率立刻有顯著的增高。前綫的電影新聞，希望能常放映給他們看。現在，演劇，電影，演藝等，不是有閑人的獨占物的時代。聽了激勵的言辭之後，從心底產生了激動，他們的答覆，是淸淸楚楚擺在我們面前的增產數字。疑惑他們的人們，除非是倒在路傍的醉漢，無自覺的人，無論從那一方面看來，是我們的敵人。（崗莊人原著—翔譯自東京讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>輕金屬工塲一瞥</h3>
<p>本工塲的工作，是用精鋁製成鋁。精鋁是從南方來的一種原料。用精鋁製成礬土，是〇〇工塲的工作，而〇〇工塲的工作則是從礬土製成鋁。鋁的用途如何，何以是重要的物資，這大概任何人都巳經知道的了。</p>
<p>鋁工業是一種最新的工業，尤其在日本，是最近才興起的。因此，該方面的專門家很缺乏，完全可以說是外行。外行人做事，常作一百八十度的大回轉。從外行人所視爲好的方法再行突進，於此，我們可以看出了這工塲幹部人員異常的決意。</p>
<p>礬土轉化成鋁，須在强力的電解爐中，除去礬土的酸素。而實地見過這電解爐並有經騐的人，除武田工塲長，安田製造課長之外，沒有第三人。由此二人領導，率領了轉業者，殘傷軍人，少年工等生手工人，開始建設。建設的時候，同時即須開始操業。事態的急促，有如此者。</p>
<p>在屋頂尙未完工的工廠中，已經開始工作了。落雨的日子，一邊撑着傘，一邊作工。上面的建築工事正在進行中，所以水泥和砂屑零零碎碎地掉下來，而在其下，電解爐已經燒得血紅了。「烟囱中初次冒出烟時，很爲愉抉」。</p>
<p>係長們回憶當時的景况說。「但也很擔心。做出來的東西究竟是不是鋁呢？恰似擔心初出世的嬰孩，是否具有完備的身體構造一樣。」這是武田工塲長的述懷。當局深懷疑懼說：「像蹩些外行人眞的就開始工作嗎？」可是幹部們擔任下來「做了再說」。毅然做下去。於是成功了。幹部以下全部人員結成一體，埋首苦幹。</p>
<p>大清早，星尙閃亮着，已經開始工作了。沒有星期日。亦不假借增產命令，無論每月休息幾次，但幹部們則幾乎是滑休息。現在的電解係長等，據說自去年的十一月以來，一天也沒有休息過。至於工員的健康狀態，則非常良好。工塲長的信條說，一個人忙於工作，疾病就無由而入，事實上幹部們的精神確很旺盛。忙於指導的安田製造課長，一面觀着在灼熱的電解爐旁工作的工員，一面說：「在本工塲，事務上的同人也須做這工作。所以在任伺時候，任何人都須　備作預備軍」。在幾百度的灼熱中，在最初的時候，手和臉面都被灼燙得很疼痛。可是工塲長首先領導，誰都沒有話說。〇〇工塲方面，最初也曾有障礙，但全部工員誠實地嚴守部署之後，目前已有十二分的能率，係長說：「無論有多少增產命令下來，不用恐懼。」</p>
<p>這裏的西田工塲長，也穿着工作裝，捲着綁腿，在一起勞勸。兩工塲長都巳年近耳順，爲期業的元老，可是他們仍有凌越壯年的氣概，實在偉大。</p>
<p>在〇〇工塲，由橋本工作課長指導，各工程頗有成就。用赤色的精鋁，製成白色的礬土，這工塲自然地分爲赤白二色。一般說來，化學工塲與機械工塲不同。在這裏沒有用巨大的鐵槌敲擊灼熱的鐵片的大塲面，也沒有用迅速的旋盤一齊運轉表示工作緊張的鬧猛。祇有誘導一定的化學　化的　　，如固定的型式般運結着。因而工員的數量也很少，有時候某地方甚至於一個人也沒有。但仔細看時，却又有幾個工員的眼睛，很注意地在看那度數表。爲了保持全部工程的健康狀態，在微細的疾病未發生前先加防止，故看守工作的工員，不容有片刻的懈怠。</p>
<p>在這裏忍耐地守着部署的工員，都是少年工。</p>
<p>我在〇〇工塲寄宿舍的食堂中，與這些少年工，共進晚餐。</p>
<p>食事完畢，作了一小時的爪哇從軍談之後，舉行工員幹部的座談會，都很潑刺有朝氣。其中也有攻略巨港的勇士。在〇〇工塲，也曾作一番談話，這裏的舍監，是爪哇攻略軍中東海林部隊的勇士。</p>
<p>鋁的用途很廣，因而工員們的精神也很昂揚。轉業者對工作異常認眞，得了出乎意料以上的成續。這大工塲很順利地完成了所負擔的任務。（淺野晃原著——翔譯自東京讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>杜佛海峽德軍防綫巡禮　空前的屠殺隱伏在美麗的沙中</h3>
<p>假使英美要在歐洲登陸，他們將選擇何地爲登陸地點呢？從政治的理由出發，似應在巴爾幹，但是從戰略的打　出發，應該是法國海岸。這是最近頗　興味的問題。英美不久將在法國登　的傳說，大爲流行，法國一般人都很相信。在這謠諑繁興的時期中，德軍駐法當局招待少數外國記者，視察法國的大西洋岸，地中海岸，以答覆英美無綫電宣傳之虛妄。記者經十餘日之旅行，茲先將英法海峽德軍的警備，報吿於後：</p>
<p>磨礪以須的少年兵</p>
<p>大家知道在此次戰爭中，一切防禦設備，都是深度作戰與縱深設備。</p>
<p>我們從法國北部出發，直至比利時邊境，見到了德軍的這個縱深設備。離開海岸數十公里，在想不到的處所，滿佈着戰車隊，對戰車砲隊。並於此地又見到了尙未有實戰經騐的少年新兵，正在不斷的訓練中。自荷蘭以至於比利時，法國，義國的占領地區，對英美戒備森嚴，同時，這些地方，又是日新月異的戰略之大演習塲。在此地有因東部戰綫的經騐而改造的許多新兵器，强大的坦克，最有效率的輕便機關砲。血氣方剛的少年兵，用可驚的明朗與熱誠，終日在演習着。指揮他們的差不多全是佩有戰功鐵十字章的靑年將校。</p>
<p>在他們演習的原野之傍，是前次大戰中戰死的德·法·比將十們的墓地。也有此次戰爭中殞命的英兵。加拿大兵的墓地。在這些墓前，他們捧獻着美麗的花一朶。</p>
<p>杜佛海峽風景綫</p>
<p>我們用自行車在英法海峽特有的濃霧中巡視比國境內。暮色蒼茫中浮上了戴着鐵盔的德兵。蹀　往來的影子，悠閒自在，似不知有戰爭者。</p>
<p>在法·比國境附近的奧斯鄧特，是十九世紀歐洲第一海水浴塲，我們在那地方之南的一個小鎭上過夜，結束了我們第一日的行程。第二天，我們的視察，從因英軍撤退而著名的鄧扣克起，至拿破崙籌備登陸英國本士的波洛臬，這一帶是與英國最接近的杜佛海峽海岸。鄧扣克·波洛臬·狄埃浦各地德軍防禦設備的詳細，恕記者不能盡述。不過，德軍在戰勝法國之後，不足三年的期間，已經築成了比法國費十幾年工夫所築成的隊寄諾防綫更鞏固的防禦陣地。我們祇要知道這些，已經够了。因爲沿海岸一帶都是與歷年來不變其形態的砂丘的連續，所以所謂防禦陣地，也盡是古代式建築的強大要塞。砂丘背面是古老的港鎭，一條條運河伸展在霧氣彌漫的天空下。波特萊爾之「旅的誘惑」一詩所歌詠的哀情，正是這海岸的風景綫。</p>
<p>遍地密怖的地雷</p>
<p>但是現在河山雖然依舊，人事却巳全非。詩人們所懷戀的風景之背後，有可驚的構築潛隱着。丘陵起伏的海岸綫，全部變成了重要的高射砲機槍的火網窩。漁舍屋頂上的紅瓦，原似畫中一般那麼動人，可是已成爲噴射火燄的機械。沿海岸而行，數公里之間，似乎沒有看見一處防禦陣地，也沒有看見一個兵士，但那嚮導我們的司令官却明朗地笑着說「假使英兵到此地來，將有很幸運的遭遇哩！」如其仔細的看時，砂丘與海岸之間，到處張滿着鐵刺綱與戰車防禦綫，某將校引導我們到一個個地下火網窩去參觀，詳細解釋，所見的沒有一件不使我們不爲之咋舌。這些設備，不能每一處都用正確的數字去叙述，正是不勝遺憾。防禦的構築，不止沿海岸地帶，並深入數公里之遙，到處是地雷區域。這一切設備，無論那一個可以作數個月的單獨防禦。兵士們親手建造了淸潔的地下醫院和地下劇塲。這裏同時並存着戰時與平時的生活。某火網窩的一角，盛開着兵士們手植的山慈姑花。</p>
<p>不僅在德國的兵隊中間，可見到人間生活力的旺盛，卽居住於這海岸綫村鎭中法國居民們也有同樣旺盛的生活力。鄧扣克·加萊·波洛臬的許多市鎮，因一九四〇年德英空軍的轟炸，化成一片廢墟。但這地方的人們不捨得就此拋棄了家鄉。蔬菜攤，麵包店，都已陸續開設出來，街這極爲雜沓。通過加萊某鎭的時候，見有少女十數人正在破落的庭院中嬉戲。被野火燒盡的荒野中，又見到蕙蘭的茁生了。</p>
<p>陶德工程隊的活躍</p>
<p>德軍的防禦設施正在加强，比國的勞働者，在「陶德工程隊」（陶德是故德國公路總監，國防工程專家）管轄下，建築新的工事，也有女子參雜在中間。這些被徵發的勞働者，當必要時，也有武裝戰鬥的能力。守衛海岸的兵士，許多會經騐過東戰傷的激戰。</p>
<p>一夜與霧是兵士們所認爲最苦的事，濃霧密佈的日子，太陽隱蔽她的身子，遇到這種時候，兵十們都全部部署就緒，枕戈而待。」</p>
<p>其將校這樣地說着。但雖在這不斷的緊張空氣中，他們的臉上却一點也沒有陰鬱之色。</p>
<p>總之，在這英法海峽的一角，德軍發揮了近代防禦力的最大能力。記者佇立在英法海峽的砂丘上，耽懷着深切的感慨眺望時，不勝滄桑之感。數世紀來，這海峽持續了英國與大陸的各種命運，拿破崙曾在汶洛　沉思數月之久，計劃怎樣在英國登陸。現在竟一變而爲德軍在此地待機出動，空前的屠殺，潛隱在這美麗的砂之下。太陽在灰色的大海的彼方漸漸地沉下去了，歷史將在什麽時候重演她的宿命呢？（巴黎特電—翔；譯自四月四日東京每日新聞）</p>

<p>仰光十七日中央社電　緬甸德巴瑪新愛薩黨本日在此間舉行新年大會，黨魁巴莫即席發表演說，大意謂：吾等多年祈求之獨立，年內即將實現，故本年在緬甸，可謂爲一劃時期之年。吾人於過去數十年，爲爭取緬甸獨立，曾以赤手空拳而奮鬥，言念及此，萬感交集。今緬甸所以行將獨立者，全爲日本誠實與友情之賜，余以黨員資格，對此深表感謝，余認爲吾黨黨員爲酬答日本此種深厚之友情起見，自應與全國人民打成一片，並應實行下列四項：（一）爲捍衛國土起見，而成立防衛軍，實爲當前急務，故應儘速組織，並充實陸海空三軍，俾完成緬甸之防務。（二）爲實現緬甸獨立起見，除成立防衛軍外，全國國民均應實行勞動服務，俾使化爲廢爐之緬甸，從速復興。（三）凡未能參加上列二事之男子及兒童，則應担任其他工作，即在後方維持治安，奉公守法，爲一戰時緬甸良好國民是也。（四）一千六百萬之緬人，應在一個命令一個統率之下，團結一致，一心一德，爲實現獨立爭取最後勝利，而努力奮鬥，日德義等國國民爲爭取勝利，忍受一切犧牲之精神，實爲吾人唯一之模範，余於此願與黨員諸君共勉。</p>

<h3>英美機多架　爲德方擊落</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　此間今日披露，在過去一晝夜中，德方戰鬥機及高射砲，舉落英美飛機至少有七十八架之多，且大半係多機式轟炸機此爲德方在單獨一戰中，所獲之最大戰果。按英美機大半都係四引擎轟炸機，在德國南部與西南部開始轟炸平民，死亡頗多，住宅區受損亦巨，德方抵禦頗爲得力，迄本日中午已擊落敵機五十一架。在此戰役中，據專家評判，德方夜間戰鬥機，功績最巨，且天氣淸朗，尤爲難能，高射砲亦頗奏効。昨晚英國方面濃霧漫天，衆料受損之英美飛機，均不克安返根據地。昨日又有反軸心機數隊在白晝襲歐洲西部和平區，其中被擊落者，有十五架，其在地中海與突境損毀有十一架。</p>

<h3>波亡命政府籲請調　查　爲蘇收容被俘下落　德發表波將士萬人已遭蘇殘殺</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十七日中央社電　德軍當局，曾於四月十日招請國防記者團赴前綫，在斯摩倫斯克附近，當衆發掘波蘭軍將士一萬人被蘇聯秘密警察殘殺之墓地。此消息發表後，各國輿論大譁，英政府恐反軸心國關係，因此愈形混亂，首相邱吉爾，外相艾登，並曾於十五日宴請波蘭亡命政權總理薛柯斯基，舉行懇談。頃據倫敦來電，波蘭亡命政權十六日已發表聲明，籲請萬國紅十字會及其他公正國府團體，詳爲調査，故事情愈形惡化。又據莫斯科來電，蘇聯情報局十六”則發表聲明，否認德軍當局之報道，惟德政府則表明決組國防團體，調査以明眞相。又據柏林電，德紅十字會長高達，十六日並已邀請萬國紅十字會協力實地調査，以證實此等屍骸，是否爲蘇聯秘密警察所殘殺。</p>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　據倫敦來電波蘭亡命政權國防部長，十六日發表聲明如次；蘇聯機關報紅星報曾於一九四〇年五月十七日載稱，蘇軍於一九三九年五月十七日之戰鬥中，曾俘波蘭軍將校的一百名。據波蘭政府所得情報，蘇聯於一九三九年十一月，曾設俘虜收容所三處即斯摩倫斯克東方之科塞爾斯克，卡爾科夫附近之斯他波貝爾斯克，及加里寗附近之奧斯塔休科渥三處。而科塞爾斯克收容所收容將校四千五百名，尙有其他存虜，總計五千人。斯他波貝爾斯克收容所，計一般市民百人，將校五千八百名，其他俘虜六千五百七十名，蘇軍當局於一九四〇年四月五日至五月中句之間，將此等收容所解消，蘇波兩國政府間成立條約，及軍事協定後，於蘇領內組織波蘭軍之際，　下級士兵及一般市民七千人，行踪不明外，將校的八千三百名，亦不知去向。故柯特大使及安迭爾斯將軍，將要求蘇聯政府訪査此等波蘭軍將校之行踪，迨一九四一年十月六日，柯特大使兩次對蘇政府要求發表波蘭人俘虜名單，一九四一年十二月三日，薛科爾斯基將軍訪問莫斯科，會見斯達林議長，于會談中要求全部釋放波軍俘虜，蘇政府僅謂名單尙未編成，我方並將曾于一處收容之三千八百四十三名將校名單，手交斯達林議長，當時斯達林議長，將波人大赦之恩典，軍人及一般市民均得適用。蘇方並聲稱，已將波軍將校全部釋放。繼之一九四二年三月，惟安迭爾斯將軍再對斯達林議長手交八百名將校之追加名單，該名單所載波軍將校全未歸還，拉金斯基外長，亦再三照會蘇聯大使柏哥莫洛夫，探詢俘虜消息，波政府至今未接到蘇方關於此等俘虜行踪之回答，而德于斯摩倫斯克附近，發現波軍將校數千名之屍體，此次德政府情報，並詳細指明此等將校，係一九四〇年春被蘇方秘密警察殘殺者。故萬國紅十字會，對此次發現之公共塋地，實有加以調査而闡明眞相之必要。波政府現正要求該會，派遣代表赴波軍俘虜被殘殺之地點調査，俾明眞相云。</p>
<h3>英人每年負担　平均達五百鎊</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　昨據無綫電評論家達林氏　稱，一九四三—四四年財政年度英國之捐稅，如由所有人民平均負担，則每一英人爲五百鎊。達氏又謂政府雖已增加奢侈稅，但此項奢侈品之大部，即將禁止出售，以减低繼續進展之購買力，並鼓勵儉約，此種辦法與統制物價，與遏止通貨膨脹有關。</p>

<p>自國府發　澈查囤積投機命令後，我們　般深受物價高漲喘不過氣的平民，好比亢旱的伏天，下了一陣盼望已久的甘霖，心理上說不出的痛快，話不像的欣慰。雖然，顧慮到是否能夠「澈底査究」，「秉公辦理」，可是看到了負責澈査者的地位，以及輿論方面聲援鼓勵，依我想，總得要有一些轟動社會的事實表現，決不會虎頭蛇尾，有辱使命，因爲這是安慰民心，維持威信所繫。</p>
<p>可是現在負責査辦者已回京復命，我們所看到的祗有一家銀行査封停業·一個囤積者送法院訊辦。雖說「調査工作仍繼續進行」，但是我們看到了第一起査辦的情形，也可料想以後的情况了。真好像滿天的烏雲，結果是風吹雲散，小雨也不見一滴。難道政府對於民意與輿論都不顧，放縱這些貽害人民，擾亂社會的罪人，逍遙法外嗎？</p>
<p>關於取締囤積投機的呼聲，早充滿於社會，而近來友邦方面，對於此次澈査事件，也非常重視。輿論方面，亦一致聲援。此種熱誠，爲東亞同甘共苦道　精神之表現。如政府當局，姑息縱容，不獨對於國民之刺激過深，亦將爲友邦所輕視，故政府爲愛護人民計，爲感謝友邦熱誠計，非將囤積投機之奸商，嚴加懲罰，始能內慰民心，外樹國信，務望吾賢明當局，以事實表示。</p>

<h3>賣票時常毆辱乘客　司法界極震怒</h3>
<p>楊樹浦路八號當車賣票穆阿冬，本月九日下午七時半，在廣信路附近，與乘客揚州人馬慶文，（年二十三歲在楊樹浦紗廠爲工人，）爲買票未給找頭，經查票員責問，大起爭吵，結果穆阿冬與另車賣票頭等部施姓等將馬毆打。嗣經馬泣吿友名小黑皮者，俟該電車從楊樹浦底開返之際，由小黑皮在廣信路，着賣票穆阿冬下車，向其詰問，起衅大鬧，繼則互相動武，致穆之同伴賣票二〇七八號，號帽一頂失去。嗣小黑皮與馬慶文，及其友甬人余順富等，乘隙逃逸。案發爲楊樹浦捕房探員將馬余兩人査獲，在馬家中，解送一特法院。捕房代表律師依妨害秩序及搶奪罪，提起公訴，推事向電車賣票穆施兩人責調汝等每有發生將乘客兇毆，實屬可惡，以後不悛，當被拘案懲辦。結果兩被吿交保出外，定二十二日宣判，號帽發還。</p>

<h3>評言　合併各小銀行</h3>
<p>這一次澈査本市金融機關投機囤積一案的結束方式，已經引起了社會人士，尤其是輿論界，異口同聲的不滿表示，其理由是十分簡單的，就是我們不願意看見國府的戰時經濟政策，推行不得其效，以致不足取信於人，正如四月十一日大陸新報評論中的兩句話：「人們認爲這次的澈査，要是虎頭蛇尾而草草了事，那末費了千辛萬苦創立全國商業統制總會想走上民族資本自主動員路綫的國府經濟政策，結果反遇障碍；深恐到了最惡化的塲合，還要促成政府對民間的政治上，經濟上對立。」這兩句話可以說是等於一個很鮮明的警吿，爲我國上下所當一致記取的。</p>
<p>昨日消息，有關當局爲謀囤積事件的澈底解決起見，對於一般違反政府法令，在營業上有擾亂社會經濟的行爲者，决予斷然處置，同時對於一部份小銀行，决定予以合併。誠然，年來本市新銀行的設立甚多，形成了銀行界的別動隊，其中許多固然未必可以斷定它們是不正當的，可是，至少有一部份不是「不兼營不正當營業」的。鑒於「近墨者黑」與「害羣之馬」兩句成語，我們認爲旣經査明確實爲兼營不正當營業的小銀行，與其予以合併，使之爲綜合性的勾結，不如予以封閉，倒反來得乾脆。</p>
<p>依照上海市銀行業同業公會章程第八條第四項與第八項的規定，公會會員銀行應盡的義務，爲「答復公會諮詢及調査」，與「不兼營不正當營業」。所以，凡是屬於銀行業同業公會的銀行，——不論爲官辦或商辦，大銀行或小銀行，——應當一體由政府當局責成各地銀行公會，負責協助調査並月秉公報吿其會員銀行中是否有兼營不正當營業者。至於處罰的責任，當然屬於政府當局。</p>

<h3>譯文　囤積事件的輿論動向</h3>
<p>囤積問題已經變爲完全的政治問題，對租界各級人士，給予嚴重的衝動，租界各界希求，於國府者，當初是局部的希望主張，「嚴辦囤積者」現在已由這種局部的希望而轉爲政治的請求「希望國府刷新國民指導精神，勵行廉潔政治，俾得實現真正的中日協力，安定民生」，緣澈查囤積之後，國府發表處分的振華公司，阜通銀行，以及陳袁兩次長的聲明，頗爲租界上政治，經濟兩界識者所重視，其輿論動向大體如下。</p>
<p>（一）陳袁兩次長於十四日發表聲明謂：「此次之澈查，已吿一段落，推囤積奸商，或不止此振華公司，阜通銀行兩家，故調查工作仍繼續進行。」然而目下正是能否使取締囤積命令做到真正有威信命令的時候，這次僅僅發表了處罰小銀行，小公司，這可謂是捉了小魚，放了大魚。</p>
<p>（二）租界各界人士，都相信政治上派閥勢力，濫用其特權，作有計劃的囤積投機，那末爲了解釋羣疑起見，應該把振華公司及阜通銀行部董監事，資本金，犯罪內容公佈出來，俾得表示在上海投機市塲上已完成了指導任務，掃除民心的動搖。</p>
<p>（三）關於囤積事件希望當局在此際要以大義滅親的決心來防止囤積。</p>
<p>（四）不分任何地位，凡作擾亂民生行爲的人，希望當局一律處以極刑，使不良份子無法搗亂市面。</p>
<p>（五）這次的囤積事件，不宜輕視其在政治上的重要性，並非局部的手術就能奏效，應該根據國府的建國精神，勇猛精進，打破困難。眾皆視爲代表一般輿論的申報，十六日刋有一條題爲「捉了小魚」的社評內容是對於這次澈查囤積事件，希望把澈查結果公開，略謂：</p>
<p>我們對於這次澈查囤積案，謹提出　詢三點，請求政府及澈查人員的滿意答覆，以釋眾疑。</p>
<p>（一）國府明令中指出查有投機實據之公司銀行的原有資本若干，其運用於投機囤積的資金有若干，該項資金從何而來。</p>
<p>（二）該兩商行的大股東，及重要董監爲何許人，有無政府人員參加其間。</p>
<p>（三）如果認爲該兩商行的份子，均爲純商人中的「奸商」，那末，此外政府有關人員是否絕對無一從事於投機囤積行爲，如果事實確有，而不予檢舉澈查，故意迴護掩飾，那末，我們認爲這次政府明令澈查，是絕對的失敗。（雲鵬：譯目四月十七日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>Speculation, Hoarding, and the Price Issue: An Urgent Suggestion</h3>
<p>The reasons for high prices, according to economic principles, are primarily: one, the shortage or decrease of goods, leading to an imbalance in supply and demand, which drives up prices; and two, inflation, which directly reduces the purchasing power of money, also causing prices to rise. These are the natural main causes. However, the extent to which prices rise due to these causes should be in line with the degree of these main causes and should be gradual.</p>
<p>Therefore, most people advocate increasing production to solve the problem of goods shortages and tightening the money supply to address inflation. These are very normal and fundamental solutions, and we certainly agree with them. However, considering the current situation in Shanghai, we must first ask:</p>
<p>(1) Are goods truly scarce?</p>
<p>(2) Is there truly inflation?</p>
<p>(3) Even if there is a shortage of goods and inflation, does the speed of the shortage and inflation match the extent of price increases?</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, let's take "food," "clothing," and "daily necessities" as examples. For "food," apart from the rationed rice, additional supplies can still be obtained. There is the reality that we "change rice to porridge" and "eat two bowls instead of three," but there are still few people who starve to death due to lack of food. Some have even calculated that within the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Nanjing triangle area of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the grain production and population needs can not only be fully self-sufficient but also have surplus grain to supply for military use. As for "clothing," some have estimated that Shanghai's stock of yarn and cloth is sufficient for ten years of consumption in Central China. The item of "daily necessities" refers to daily necessities. Taking soap as an example, it is said that raw materials are the most difficult to obtain, but it is rumored that a certain bank is hoarding as many as 10,000 boxes, and in fact, middle-class families often have a considerable number of reserves of daily necessities, which is also quite substantial.</p>
<p>Although we cannot provide precise statistics, based on near-factual speculation, we dare to say that the shortage of goods in Shanghai, especially in "clothing" and "daily necessities," is not that serious, much better than in the areas under the rule of the Chongqing regime.</p>
<p>Regarding the second question, we have repeatedly heard the announcement from the financial authorities that the currency has sufficient reserves and that there is no inflation. We certainly trust the government and hope that the government will not cause inflation, so we also dare to say that the currency is not inflated.</p>
<p>Regarding the third question, let's take the price level when the old legal tender was abolished last June as an example. The black market price of "food" (rice) has risen fivefold (now slightly decreased), and "clothing" and "daily necessities" have risen by an average of about tenfold. Does this level of increase correspond to the degree of goods shortage and currency issuance? We dare to say even more that it absolutely does not correspond. The rise in prices has broken away from economic principles, deviated from the natural law of supply and demand, and is leaping like a "horse off the reins."</p>
<p>So, what caused this abnormal phenomenon of derailment? Undoubtedly, it is "artificial speculation and hoarding." With hoarding, sufficient goods become scarce; the balance of supply and demand becomes unbalanced, stimulating prices to soar. The currency has also suffered the misfortune of being unjustly accused of inflation! This crime of harming people's livelihood is truly unpardonable!</p>
<p>Now that we have clearly calculated that the reason for high prices is entirely due to rampant speculation and hoarding, we cannot help but believe that the government's past laissez-faire attitude, without the use of political power, has led to arrogance and an unmanageable situation. The people dare to be angry but dare not speak out, troubled by the mentality of "losing money by keeping banknotes, better to buy goods," creating a pitiful situation like the one described by Mr. Toyu Yoshida in his article on prices: "The vicious cycle formula of declining currency purchasing power and soaring prices is that the public themselves drive up prices but suffer the consequences." In this regard, the leading figures of the people have also failed to raise their arms and use social forces to impose sanctions, and they should also bear some responsibility.</p>
<p>Now that the government has shown concern for this issue and ordered a thorough investigation, the depth of our people's expectations cannot be expressed in words. But observing the developments in the past ten days, perhaps the government believes that there are various obstacles and will stop there. If our people continue to maintain a wait-and-see attitude, then the future of the price issue will become even more unmanageable, and the majority of ordinary people will still suffer the most.</p>
<p>In view of the overturned cart ahead, we can no longer procrastinate and sit idly by. We have offered our advice to the government's thorough investigation, and we no longer want to place the focus of discussion on "thorough! Not thorough!" Today, with even greater enthusiasm, we call on civil organizations to automatically exert effective social sanctions to settle accounts with speculators and hoarders.</p>
<p>Therefore, we suggest:</p>
<p>(1) Civil organizations, such as the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, and the Shanghai Economic Research Association, should also invite the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Japan and other friendly countries to organize an organization similar to the "Price Issue Countermeasures Research Association," inviting Chinese and Japanese economists and insightful entrepreneurs to regularly discuss countermeasures, collect public opinions at any time, and contribute them to the government for adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>(2) The same groups should "expose speculation and hoarding" and welcome citizens to report it. After a fair and accurate investigation, the findings should be announced to the public, and whether it is a business or an individual, the government should be requested to confiscate the goods or suspend operations, in order to achieve the effect of social sanctions.</p>
<p>(3) The same groups should study how to increase production, from raw materials to finished products, and have detailed, thorough, and feasible rational methods for each sector and detail to seek a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that cracking down on speculation and hoarding must start with Shanghai first, because it is the economic center of the country. If Shanghai does well, other cities will respond and follow suit, and will certainly be successful. Therefore, the significance of this work is very important.

<p>Xinjing, 17th (Central News Agency) Since his arrival here on the 9th, our country's special envoy to Manchukuo, Zhou Fohai, has received a warm welcome from all levels of society in Manchukuo. Now that his mission is complete, he is scheduled to return home soon. Special Envoy Zhou's visit to Manchukuo will make Sino-Manchukuo relations even closer, as Special Envoy Zhou visited Prime Minister Zhang, Chief of General Affairs Bu, Foreign Minister Li, and others, holding in-depth talks and discussing the strategies for China and Manchukuo to work together to complete the Greater East Asia War, enabling the two countries to achieve close contact and cooperation in the guidance of the war. He also exchanged views with the ministers of the Economic Department, Transportation Department, and Agricultural Department of Manchukuo, as well as the president and vice president of the Central Bank of Manchukuo, on strengthening the economic cooperation between China and Manchukuo to strengthen the war effort in Greater East Asia, and the two sides reached a complete consensus. Special Envoy Zhou visited Harbin, Fengtian, Fushun, Anshan, Dalian, and other places to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the development of important industries in Manchukuo, which can serve as a reference for China's economic construction. Therefore, Special Envoy Zhou's visit to Manchukuo is of great significance.</p>
<p>Dalian, 17th (Central News Agency) Since his visit to Manchukuo on the 9th of this month, our country's special envoy to Manchukuo, Zhou Fohai, has visited various parts of Manchukuo. Now that his mission is complete, Special Envoy Zhou and his entourage arrived in Dalian at 7:15 p.m. on the 16th and stayed at the Yamato Hotel that night.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 17th (Central News Agency) Our country's special envoy to Manchukuo, Zhou Fohai, was ordered to go to Dalian on the 9th to promote Sino-Manchukuo relations and strengthen economic cooperation. He stayed in Manchukuo for nearly ten days, visiting Xinjing and various political and economic centers, and has now completed his mission and returned home. According to reports, Zhou's visit to Manchukuo has epoch-making significance in the history of Sino-Manchukuo relations, and its implications for the promotion of future relations between the two countries and the revitalization of our country's economy are particularly profound. After arriving in Manchukuo, Zhou also inspected the economic construction of Manchukuo and held talks with the government and people of Manchukuo. It is generally believed that Zhou's trip has fully achieved its purpose. A brief description of Zhou's activities during his visit to Manchukuo is as follows: On the morning of the 10th, he met with the Emperor of Manchukuo, and in the afternoon, he held talks with Prime Minister Zhang; on the 13th, he was in Harbin; on the 14th, he held talks with officials and civilians in Fengtian, expressing his determination to strengthen the close cooperation between China and Manchukuo; on the 12th, he inspected the Fengman Dam on the Songhua River in Jilin; on the 14th, he inspected the Showa Steel Works; and on the 15th, he inspected important facilities such as the Fushun Coal Mine. The Fengman Dam is a major driving force for the industrial development of Manchukuo and one of the largest power plants in the world, a great monument to the successful industrial development of Manchukuo. The Showa Steel Works has achieved more than expected results in steel production since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, completing a glorious record of cooperation with Japan. This visit to Manchukuo by Zhou will not only have significant developments in Sino-Manchukuo relations in the future, but also a leap forward in the economic relations between the two countries, so Sino-Manchukuo relations and economic aspects are about to usher in a new era.</p>
<p>Lushun, 17th (Central News Agency) When our country's special envoy Zhou visited Lushun, he went to the fierce battlefields of the Russo-Japanese War, Donglakou Mountain and North Fortress, to inspect the remnants of the Japanese army's bitter fighting. He personally witnessed the steel fortress that had been destroyed by bombing and the assault tunnels that had been dug without regard for life or death within a few days, and was deeply moved. He then said in fluent Japanese: "Now that I have seen the traces of the Battle of Lushun, I deeply understand the strength of the Japanese army. Today, in order to win the Greater East Asia War, all East Asians should remember the sacred land of Lushun. The Russo-Japanese War was a beacon of liberation for the East Asian people, and this place is the birthplace of the dawn of Greater East Asia." He then went to the Lushun Museum for a visit. The curator of the museum, Mr. Imai, warmly guided him, touring various parts of the museum and explaining them at any time. Special Envoy Zhou was also deeply impressed, and finally inscribed five characters, "Essence of Cultural Relics," as a permanent souvenir.</p>
<h3>Chongqing's Organization on the Verge of Collapse, Lack of Human Resources, Only Industries Plunged into Difficulties, Employees Continue to Disperse</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) According to a special dispatch from the Guangzhou office of the Asahi Shimbun, Chongqing has recently issued various laws to ensure human resources, in an effort to ensure human resources. It is still remembered that Chiang Kai-shek had unlimited manpower in the past, and no matter how long the war lasted, he could continue to resist because of the unlimited manpower. However, later, due to the Japanese army's offensive operations, the peaceful areas gradually expanded, and the transport routes were cut off, which made the Chongqing army decline in both quality and quantity. At the same time, the only industries were also plunged into collapse or depression, and the industrial workers also dispersed as a result. Moreover, because the National Government participated in the war, Chongqing lost the name of the war of resistance, and the people in various places under its control fled to the peaceful areas in increasing numbers. All these factors have made Chongqing feel increasingly short of manpower. At present, the population under Chongqing's control is a total of 150 million, accounting for one-third of the total population of China. The distribution of this population is not as dense as the cities in the peaceful areas, engaged in industries, but scattered in the vast areas of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, and other provinces, so it is almost impossible to mobilize or requisition them in practice. Under these circumstances, the human resources on which Chongqing's war of resistance relies are also in a difficult situation. What countermeasures will Chongqing take in this regard? According to recent news, Chongqing is currently busy reviewing various issues. The first is the issue of military strength. Although the Chongqing army is currently said to number 3 million, Chongqing's propaganda says that it will prepare to mobilize 5 million or even 15 million soldiers, but in the past operations against the Japanese army in central and southern China, the Chongqing army's deaths, injuries, captures, surrenders, and deserters have been extremely numerous, so it is doubtful whether it still maintains 3 million soldiers today. This is also something that the Chongqing authorities are deeply troubled by. In January of this year, Chiang Kai-shek used rice to mobilize students to engage in official propaganda in order to increase the general public's awareness of serving in the military. On March 14, he issued a new conscription order, which stipulates that all men aged 18 to 45 must serve in the military. At the same time, it stipulates that all young people who have not enlisted, from the age of 18 to 25, must receive full military education and guerrilla warfare training, and it also stipulates that women of the same age must also engage in military auxiliary services. This is also the first law of Chongqing to mobilize women, so the difficulty of Chongqing in organizing troops and replenishing soldiers can be seen from this. The second is the issue of industrial labor. Chongqing promulgated the "National General Mobilization Law" on March 29 last year to expand weapons, materials, and productivity, and to ensure manpower. In the "Twelfth Plenary Session" in January last year, the "Labor Service Proposal" was also resolved, with the aim of using labor to supplement the lack of funds and materials. In January of this year, a labor law was promulgated again, attempting to improve workers' welfare in order to encourage workers' interest in work, and a major publicity campaign was launched immediately. In early March, it ordered its subordinate "provincial governments" to implement fixed wages. The conciliatory policy implemented by the capitalists towards the labor class is nothing more than a tactic. At the same time, the Labor Service Law promulgated in mid-February stipulates that regardless of gender, everyone must serve for one hour every day, fulfilling 250 hours within one year or serving continuously for 30 days, and those who do not wish to serve can pay a cash substitute. Moreover, there is also a great shortage of technical personnel in various places under Chongqing's rule. It is learned that there are currently 300 American engineers engaged in developing industries, and universities and specialized schools are also focusing on cultivating technical talents. From this, it can be seen that Chongqing's wartime policy is already in a situation where it cannot be rebuilt in terms of technology. Although Chongqing is trying to enhance the concept of labor service, it is forcibly enlisting the able-bodied young men of overseas Chinese who fled to the mainland from Malaya and Burma after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and the rest are also forced to serve, and no technical personnel are spared. Liang Hancao, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Chongqing Kuomintang, recently went to the Northwest to observe. He said that he plans to move 100 million people to develop the Northwest in the future. On the one hand, the direct guidance agency for immigration is based on the decision of the administrative meeting in October last year, appointing Chen Shuren, chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Liu Weizhi, minister of the Kuomintang Overseas Department, Wu Zhongxin, chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and Feng Yuxiang, vice chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, as members of the Northwest Immigration Development Committee, and ordering all provinces to implement the "Northwest Immigration Development Law," stipulating that all people aged 18 to 45 who are healthy in body and mind and who are deemed by the authorities to be unemployed must be moved to the Northwest for reclamation. All these indicate that Chongqing is greatly troubled by the most practical labor issues and future countermeasures to ensure manpower. Chongqing used to boast of having unlimited manpower, but now it has fallen into the difficult situation of having to strive to ensure manpower, which is also an important reason for its impending collapse.</p>
<h3>War Results of the Japanese Army in Shandong</h3>
<p>Jinan, 17th (Central News Agency) The Japanese army units annihilated more than 400 communist bandits near Yangsongjia in northwestern Shandong Province on the 10th of this month. On the 14th, they turned to the west and besieged about 400 troops of the Chongqing army led by Li Wenkui and Long Honghai in the southern part of En County. After a fierce attack for five hours, they completely annihilated their main force. In this battle, more than 290 corpses of the Chongqing army were left behind, and the body of Li Wenkui was also among them. In addition, 58 people were captured, and a large amount of weapons and ammunition were seized.</p>
<p>Kaifeng, 17th (Central News Agency) General Sun Liangcheng has been participating in the peace camp since March 22 of last year, and it has been a year now. Within this one-year period, his Second Route Army has achieved the following war results in the areas north of Shangqiu on the Longhai Line and in the areas of Cao County, Shan County, and Dingtao in the southwestern part of Shandong Province: 121 engagements, 12,000 troops of the Chongqing Communist Army engaged, 3,734 corpses of the Chongqing Communist Army abandoned, and 291 captured. In addition, the seized items included 27 light machine guns, 845 rifles, 12,843 rounds of ammunition, 872 hand grenades, and a large number of other military supplies.</p>
<h3>Trends in the Economic Circles of North China: Shanxi Industrial Association Celebrates its First Anniversary</h3>
<p>Shanxi Industrial Co., Ltd. is responsible for guiding the development of Shanxi's treasures. April 1st is the anniversary of its establishment. At the beginning of its establishment, it unified 36 military-managed factories under 12 major associations and their employees, including 1,389 Japanese and 15,771 Chinese, and engaged in the development of Shanxi under a comprehensive plan. In addition to continuing to operate the original iron manufacturing, coal, flour milling, paper making, electricity, textile, cement, kiln, machinery manufacturing, leather, gunpowder manufacturing, tobacco, matches, wood harvesting, soda industry, and other industries, the company also develops resources related to these industries, undertaking the task of an industrial army in a serious situation. At the beginning of its establishment, it encountered considerable difficulties, but it finally overcame them in a short period of one year, laying a solid foundation for today. This is really due to the success of the leaders.</p>
<p>Shanxi's land resources are biased to one side. The Yuncheng area in the south is 300 meters above sea level, the Taiyuan area in the central part is 700 meters above sea level, and the Wutai area in the north is more than 1,000 meters above sea level. Therefore, the agricultural crops produced in the south are wheat and cotton, and the central and northern parts are mainly miscellaneous grains. In addition, two-thirds of the province is mountainous, so there are no extravagant expectations for surface resources. The current situation in the province is only enough to maintain self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Shanxi deserves the name of treasure house for its underground resources. Coal, iron, stone bones, limestone, and other minerals have amazing reserves. Developing these inexhaustible underground resources is an urgent task in the process of traveling the war and building Greater East Asia, so expectations are very high. The production volume of various factories and mines under the jurisdiction of Shanxi Industrial Co., Ltd. is extremely surprising, but the details are still unknown.</p>
<p>The total amount of coal buried in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Shanxi Province accounts for half of it. Some people say it reaches 1.2 trillion tons, and the general estimate is 120 billion tons. This amount is 35 times the reserves of Manchukuo. This is very promising for the future of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. When the exchange of north-south resources in the Co-Prosperity Sphere is brought into the right track, the coal and other unlimited underground resources of the Shanxi treasure house are being prepared under the grand plan of the Shanxi Industrial Bureau.</p>
<p>The private capital of Shanxi Industrial Co., Ltd. is 30 million yen, and the total number is 100 million yen. President Koomoto Daisaku has four executive directors, two directors, and two auditors. Executive Director Yano Nobuhiko contributed a lot to the establishment of the company and is truly a meritorious minister who should be remembered forever by this great industrial group.

<h3>Establishment of the North China Trade Control General Association</h3>
<p>The third regular meeting of the North China Trade Federation was held at the conference room of the association from 1:00 p.m. on the 7th. Representatives of 31 groups belonging to the association participated.</p>
<p>Report items: The business plan for the 17th year (ie, the 31st year), the original Tianjin and Qingdao Import and Export Allocation Union, has been reorganized, with branches in various places, and offices have been established in Tokyo, Xinjing, and Shanghai, and dispatch offices have been established in Seoul, Dalian, Zhangjiakou, and Shanhaiguan.</p>
<p>Deliberation items: The National Commercial Control General Association has already been established in Central China. Since this association is the central agency for trade control in North China, and in order to adapt to Japan's new policy toward China and emphasize Sino-Japanese cooperation, the North China Trade Federation should be renamed the North China Trade Control General Association.</p>
<p>Decision items: (1) Business plan for the 18th year (the 32nd year). (2) The budget for income and expenditure for the business plan this year, with the income mainly from the handling fees for control, and supplemented by subsidies from the government. The control handling fees originally collected in Tianjin and Qingdao will be collected by the General Association. (3) Determine the membership fees, assessed tax amounts, and collection methods of the groups in each state. (4) Elect officers after the name change. (5) Slightly increase the control handling fee.</p>
<p>In addition, Guan Bo, the economic minister of the Japanese Embassy in Peiping, declared at the meeting: Due to the change in Japan's policy toward China, China will be autonomous in economic terms in the future, and North China will use the North China Trade Control General Association as the center to control trade. In particular, the trade between Central China and North China should respect the autonomy of the Chinese side. In trade with Japan, some commodities should also be entrusted to the Chinese side as much as possible if possible. (Peiping Special Dispatch —— Sho: Translated from the Western Daily News of April 9.)</p>
<h3>Smoother Exchange of Goods between North and Central China</h3>
<p>Wei Meibei, of the Beijing Embassy Affairs Department, who attended the Huazhong-Huabei Exchange Conference held in Nanjing and Shanghai in late March and returned to Beijing, met with a group of reporters on the 6th and announced the decisions made at the meeting as follows:</p>
<p>The meeting was convened by the Nanjing Embassy, and the exchange problem was discussed for two days starting on the 15th. From the 27th, the trade problem was discussed for two days. This meeting was divided into four subgroups: food, coal, cotton, and others, to hold separate meetings. A preparatory meeting was also held in Shanghai. Originally, the National Government and the North China Political Affairs Commission failed to form a whole group economically due to the relationship between the Reserve Certificates and the United Reserve Certificates, and the transaction between the two was also not smooth. As a result of the meeting, efforts will be made to open up the current situation in the future to make the exchange of materials between the two regions smoother. Therefore, Central China will supply North China with the most needed food materials such as wheat and soybean meal in large quantities. Although North China will supply coal and other materials as compensation, there is still a considerable import surplus. The settlement method has also been discussed and decided. According to the fundamental policy of material flow, the imbalance in the exchange settlement this year will be allowed to exist, and the settlement will use both the Reserve Certificate and no exchange methods. For important materials in the Reserve Certificate settlement part, half of the imbalance amount will be used as a loan from the Reserve Bank to North China as one of the settlement methods. Therefore, a leap forward in trade between Central China and North China can be expected. (Beijing Electric, Sho: Translated from the Western Daily News of April 8.)</p>

<p>Delegation Leader Liu Xuemao (29 years old, working at the Capital Control Department): The deepest impression I have from this visit to China is the research conference, training, and mutual provision of information resolved by the Chinese, Japanese, and Manchurian youth corps at the founding ceremony on the 31st. In short, the greatest gain seems to be the creation of substantial content from a beautiful form. I now deeply feel that China, with a great leader like Mr. Wang, who directs the youth with his enthusiasm and effort, has already risen up as a new China. China's youth are truly blessed.</p>
<p>Female Class Leader Kihara Kiyoko (20 years old, a first-year student in the specialized course at Xinjing Shikishima Girls' High School): Before and after arriving in Nanjing, we were quite busy. On the last day, representatives of the Japanese, Chinese, and Manchurian youth corps gathered together. Although we did not speak the same language, the harmonious atmosphere was overflowing. We will never forget this spirit. The Chinese youth are extremely fortunate to have the chairman and Mr. Lin as their guides. (Translated from the Western Daily News, April 11)</p>

<h3>British and American Forces in Northeast Tunisia Fail to Invade Axis Positions. Fierce Fighting Ensues, and Positions Change Hands Multiple Times. French Rebel Army Now Sends Troops to Advance Towards Bondufa.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th – According to a German News Agency report, on Wednesday and Thursday, Eisenhower's forces in northeastern Tunisia repeatedly attempted to invade the Axis line. However, due to the tenacious resistance of the German and Italian forces, the positions remained unchanged. The latest news from the British front confirms that the British First Army, commanded by General Anderson, and the North African guerrilla forces are engaged in fierce fighting. In the northern mountainous region, the German and Italian forces launched fierce counterattacks and repelled the British forces. At Gabès, the high ground has been repeatedly gained and lost. According to the latest British news last night, the high ground was still in British hands last night. In the mountains north of Béja, the anti-Axis forces launched a fierce attack on April 14th, hoping to break through the Axis line. However, by evening, the most important position was still in German hands. German grenadiers and Italian soldiers fought side by side and, on April 13th, repaired the multiple breaches made by the anti-Axis forces. In this battle, hundreds of anti-Axis soldiers were captured. Anti-Axis fighter planes and artillery were ineffective. According to anti-Axis sources, a detachment of the French rebel army is advancing towards Bondufa, aiming to reach Tunis directly. The struggle for the highway between the villages of Kairouan and Pont-du-Fahs is very intense. At the same time, British forces launched several attacks on the German vanguard in the south, but with little success. The British Eighth Army is currently establishing positions near Enfidaville. According to the army's war correspondent, General Montgomery is encountering significant difficulties there.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 17th – Combining news from the North African front, the anti-Axis forces east of Bengerdan and in the regions of Méjez el-Bab launched a general offensive on the 16th after a fierce bombardment. In the direction of Bengerdan, the Axis forces fought bravely and inflicted great damage on the British and French rebel forces, repelling them. Heavy fighting also broke out between the two armies in the Jebel Al-Rihane region, northwest of Méjez el-Bab. The Axis forces were once overwhelmed by the superior Montgomery forces and fell into a dangerous position of being surrounded. However, by employing skillful mechanized warfare, the situation turned favorable again. They began a fierce counterattack on the morning of the 16th. In conclusion, the battle on the 16th was a complete failure for the anti-Axis forces. The Axis forces seem poised to take advantage of the initiative and launch a fierce counterattack.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Turin, 17th – Stefani Agency reports that Stephan is commenting from here on the war in Tunisia, saying that although it is difficult to predict who will emerge victorious in the battle, the Axis forces now have a smaller operational area but more solid positions, stronger military strength, and better equipment than the enemy. Rear transportation is maintained by a fully operational railway network. The area currently occupied by the Axis forces was seized last November, and the German and Italian forces are undoubtedly able to strengthen their defenses.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 17th – According to a maritime news military correspondent, there were no changes in the Tunisian situation in the 24 hours from noon on Thursday to noon on Friday. The British Eighth Army in the southern sector has apparently not yet completed the concentration of its artillery. Since the battle of El Alamein, General Montgomery has always initiated large-scale attacks with rapid and continuous fire, but this time it is proving difficult to accumulate a large amount of ammunition for such rapid and continuous fire. This is because the harbor facilities at Gabès, Sfax, and Sousse have been thoroughly destroyed by the Axis forces before their retreat. Therefore, all supplies for the British Eighth Army must be moved by land, along the only coastal road, which winds greatly along the eastern coast of Tunisia. The distance from the British Eighth Army's last supply base north of the Mareth Line to the area north of Sousse is over 400 kilometers. Although the British forces have a large number of motor vehicles, it will take considerable time to transport the large amount of ammunition needed to launch a new offensive. This may be the main reason why the British Eighth Army has delayed launching a large-scale attack on the Axis positions at Enfidaville. However, this delay is probably only temporary. At present, General Montgomery's troops are only conducting small-scale raids and reconnaissance strikes in the hope of probing the strength of the Axis's new line in the southern sector. On the western front of the bridgehead, there is more fighting activity, but even now, it cannot be said that there is a large-scale attack, only local battles. General Anderson's aim is obviously to tie down the German forces and to gain a favorable starting point to continue his offensive. However, Anderson's plan did not succeed on Thursday. Jebel Ouanana (northwest of Méjez el-Bab) and the heights north of Béja, which were fiercely contested by both sides, remained in German hands. At the same time, the French rebel army, fighting on the right flank of the British First Army in the southeastern region of Bou Arada, was also forced to retreat by a German counterattack. Further west on the Tunisian front, the Axis forces have not been forced to use reserves in any location.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting at Kuban Bridgehead. Soviet Forces Suffer Extremely Heavy Losses. German Forces in the Donets Region Repulse Fierce Soviet Attacks.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 17th – It was announced here last night that in the fierce fighting at the Kuban bridgehead on Thursday, the Soviet forces lost an entire tank brigade and at least five regiments. Therefore, the Soviet losses in the past few days amounted to the equivalent of three divisions. The Soviet forces advanced with several regiments and a large number of armored vehicles against German positions in the mountains and on the dikes. However, the Soviet tanks in the front line were stopped by concentrated anti-tank guns and forced to turn back. The infantry they were covering suffered heavy losses under German machine-gun fire. The Soviet forces attacked repeatedly throughout the day, but were repulsed with heavy casualties. The German air force played a great role in defending the positions. Romanian, Slovak, and Croatian squadrons also joined the battle. In this large-scale air battle, a total of 58 Soviet planes were shot down, and another eight were shot down by anti-aircraft guns and machine guns.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 17th – German authorities announced that German forces in the Donets region launched two fierce attacks on Soviet forces on the 16th, repulsing them, killing 770 enemy soldiers, capturing over 100 prisoners, and seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition. In the northern sector, German forces also bombarded important military factory areas and shipyard areas in Leningrad, causing several fires.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Helsinki, 17th – Stefani Agency reports that the Finnish High Command announced yesterday afternoon that in the past 24 hours, Finnish assault troops had penetrated enemy positions in the eastern sector of the Karelian Isthmus and destroyed their strong defensive works. The enemy forces immediately launched a counterattack, but to no avail and retreated with losses. Another Soviet unit that rushed to the battlefield was also bombarded by Finnish artillery and retreated in disarray. In the eastern area, after more than an hour of fierce fighting, the Finnish forces repulsed a fierce attack by the Soviet assault troops.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 17th – A correspondent for the German Popular Newspaper in Stockholm, Sweden, claimed that Finland's ability to engage in total war relies entirely on the character of its people. Once Finland enters a war, it is forced to mobilize its men, women, and children, regardless of profession, class, or age. This kind of warfare experience cannot be avoided and leaves a deep impression on its people that will never be erased. Germany is the only country that supports Finland as an ally.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 17th – German forces on the Eastern Front have now begun using the latest model of tank, named "Tiger." Soviet authorities have also acknowledged the extremely powerful offensive capabilities of this new type of tank. According to a German newspaper report on the 16th, the operational situation of this new type of tank is as follows: When the German forces were previously fighting in the Belgorod region, they used the latest model "Tiger" tank. Initially, they approached Soviet tanks to a very close distance before suddenly launching an attack. Within two or three minutes, they set the Soviet tanks on fire. When only three meters away from a Soviet tank, they used their heavy guns to attack, instantly destroying the Soviet tank's turret. Other Soviet tanks, upon seeing this tank, were about to retreat separately. The "Tiger" tank then used its maximum speed to closely pursue the Soviet tank formation and annihilate them all.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Strength Increases; Australia and India Take Notice</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th – As the pressure exerted by the Japanese military on the Pacific and Indian Oceans increases daily, the Australian government, the Southwest Pacific anti-Axis military headquarters, and the British Indian military headquarters have all issued appeals. They are all troubled by the Japanese offensive, and this has caused anti-Axis countries to re-evaluate Japanese military strength. London News Chronicle war correspondent Metron, in a report from a port in the South Pacific, said that although the figures for Japanese military strength from the beginning of the war were all speculation, their conclusion that Japanese military strength has increased is worth noting. His report stated that according to recent news, Japan currently has a total of 7.5 million tons of ships. The shipyards in Hong Kong, Singapore, Surabaya, and Manila were not thoroughly destroyed in the past, so recovery is easy. These shipyards have all resumed work in the past year and have achieved considerable results. Although the exact figures are not known, they must be at least 7.5 million tons. Based on this, it can be seen that we underestimated Japan's national strength at the beginning of the war, and we may have underestimated the number of ships Japan possessed. In addition, the numbers of Japanese ships sunk published since the beginning of the war, mainly by the United States, may not be accurate, and the same is true for its air force.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 17th – The Australian government and the Southwest Pacific anti-Axis military headquarters have recently repeatedly issued statements about being threatened by the Japanese military. This matter has indeed become a major issue in US political circles and is gradually involving the issue of Macworth's advancement or retreat. According to a Washington dispatch, the anti-Axis military headquarters has also refuted the statements made by anti-Axis army commanders White and Macworth in the Southwest Pacific.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Technology Association Holds Second Conference</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – The second conference of the Japanese Army Technology Research Association opened here on the 14th of this month. More than 1,300 people from the military and civilian scientific personnel attended. Over the days, they presented over 300 research reports on military equipment, air defense machinery, clothing, food, hygiene, veterinary medicine, shipping materials, construction, and military supplies, fully promoting the important mission of the Japanese scientific community and contributing to enhancing combat power. The association has now concluded after completing its discussions today.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Strength Increases in the Aleutian Islands</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th – According to news from New York, reprinted from a US base in Alaska, the Japanese military in the Aleutian Islands is stronger than before. The Japanese military's artillery positions on Kiska Island and Attu Island have greatly increased since the beginning of March.</p>
<h3>Britain and Chongqing Blame Each Other for Failure in the Burma Campaign</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th – According to information obtained here, after the British and Indian forces were defeated north of the Jili River on the Indo-Burmese border, the British and Chongqing warlords blamed each other for the responsibility. The British side believes that the defeat was due to the Chongqing army failing to launch cooperative operations on the Yunnan border. The Chongqing side criticized the British and Indian forces for being unprepared for combat, resulting in a panicked retreat. A spokesperson for the Chongqing army publicly pointed out to the press corps on the 15th that it was impossible to retake Burma. Regarding the Japanese appointment of Lieutenant General Kawabe as the supreme commander in Burma, he said that the Japanese side will definitely launch new operations with this change of commanders, so the actions of the Japanese army in the future must be guarded against.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Announces US and Australian Military Casualties</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th – According to a dispatch from Melbourne, the Australian Anti-Axis Headquarters announced yesterday that as of April 1st, the total number of American and Australian casualties in New Guinea was 10,531, including American air force personnel and soldiers, and Australian soldiers killed, wounded, and missing.</p>
<h3>America's Disadvantageous Position on the Pacific Front</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 17th – According to a Washington dispatch, Mackworth and the Australian government have reached a state of opposition with the Washington military leadership regarding the issue of strengthening the air force on the Southwest Pacific front. The US Congress is also paying close attention to this. Senator Chandola, a Democrat, said on the 16th that he recently intended to awaken the attention of the Congress to the attention of the progress of the Pacific War. The current position of the US military on the Pacific front is not necessarily advantageous. He should not neglect the crisis in that area.</p>
<h3>German "Flying Divisions" Transferred to the Atlantic Coast</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Zurich, 17th – A special correspondent for the Swiss newspaper "Tat" reports that Hitler has transferred "flying divisions" from the Eastern Front to France. Behind the Atlantic Wall, there are now powerfully armed motorized infantry and tank units, which are highly mobile and can be used at any point where the enemy breaks through the line. Judging from the medals on the uniforms of many soldiers in these divisions, it can be seen that they are experienced soldiers from the Eastern Front. With their arrival in France, the combat power of Germany's western defenses has been greatly enhanced.</p>
<h3>Visit to a Japanese Industrial Aircraft Manufacturing Plant</h3>
<p>This is a factory with a very old tradition of manufacturing wooden training aircraft. The manufacturing of wooden aircraft began around the eleventh year of the Taisho era [1922], and after twenty years of continuous effort, it has created such excellent aircraft as it does today. All profits are put aside, and only the interests of the motherland and the progress of technology are pursued. This has created true Japanese technology, and the achievement of that technology has led to today's leap forward.</p>
<p>"At first, what joy it was to see the aircraft we made with our own hands fly into the sky!"</p>
<p>Here, countless people have gathered from various prefectures and workplaces to work in the factory. A traffic volunteer corps, automatically organized by staff and workers, directs traffic with waving hands and whistling, and arranges machine parts. In the midst of this, an old gentleman with graying hair is particularly noticeable. Upon approaching him, it is learned that this is the factory owner, Director Yasuke Okada. If the director is not seen one day, the workers will be lost all day long, and if he is on sick leave, the entire factory will know about it, and the staff can be heard expressing their indignation.</p>
<p>"Why do the people around here all seem absent-minded?"</p>
<p>For the director, they would go through fire and water without hesitation. This long-standing and strong tradition of Japanese workers has planted the roots of astonishment here.</p>
<p>Upon entering, there is a memorial hall built after a visit from the Emperor. In front of this memorial hall, the soldiers are stepping up their efforts to advance to their duties in the workplace and engage in increased production. A row of factories plays an exciting symphony of production, and the electrical transformer roars like a lion. The achievement board for attendance rate competition, towering in the morning wind, and the job tags displayed in the factory (name and number tags) all show a state of decisive battle. Among the name tags of all those present, there are symbols in the shape of stars indicating dispatch to war.</p>
<p>Every time they hang up their job tags, in the depths of their hearts, they hear the sound of aircraft made with their own hands soaring in the sky on distant battle lines. After visiting the photographs of the war dead enshrined in the shrine, they cannot help but angrily strike the wooden mallet heavily, using it to vent the fighting spirit that wells up in their hearts.</p>
<p>The layout of the machinery, the transportation of materials and products, inspection, lighting, etc., all have the best equipment, accumulated over many years of history and experience. Not only that, but because of the shortage of fuel, working in the dark is considered the ultimate comfort by the warriors. They only abandon their work until they return to the dormitory to take a bath.</p>
<p>The severe cold of the morning makes their fingers feel like they are being pricked by needles, but they ignore it, and they absolutely do not allow themselves time to rub their hands for warmth. The enemy is watching intently, plotting to bomb the Japanese mainland. Aircraft bear a heavy responsibility for the safety of the motherland, and if the warriors neglect their duties, the consequences are unimaginable. This is the first line of maintenance!</p>
<p>However, there is no need to worry unnecessarily. The production efficiency, which tends to decline every year in the middle of February, has been rising linearly since September of last year. The situation in the first month [January] left the heads of the company speechless. February was even more shocking. Materials became increasingly scarce, and the number of apprentice workers increased, but miracles continued to occur, completely overturning past common sense. This is the reason why Japan is truly strong! It is a mysterious power!</p>
<p>In order to have more repetitions of miracles, we ask the warriors to use the spirit of self-sacrifice to serve the motherland. The enemy is a combination of Jewish capital, American materials, and the Anglo-Saxon race, a demonic evil.</p>
<p>Therefore, what I talked about with the warriors in the Third Mitsubishi Makoto Dormitory that night, sincerely and without restraint, in order to increase miracles, I will pass on to the people of the country, hoping that everyone will have a deeper understanding and cooperation with the production camp.</p>
<p>Emotional excitement is the driving force of the increased production movement. The warm send-off received when departing from their hometown naturally turned them into strong warriors. Authorities in various prefectures, in view of the heavy responsibilities borne by apprentice workers, don't they need greater cooperation in the selection of personnel? The apprentice workers who first enter the workplace can be regarded as a testing device for each prefecture's understanding of the current situation. If a bad element mixes in, not only will the partners be disgraced, but it will also hinder the country's desire to build more aircraft.</p>
<p>When a certain worker left his village, he did not receive a grand send-off or encouragement. Therefore, he did not know the importance of the work he was undertaking, so he once claimed illness and returned home. But the situation in his hometown village had changed greatly from when he was away. They had already awakened to the importance of the current situation. He returned to the factory with shame, and afterwards, he became a model worker.</p>
<p>In a certain village, schoolchildren from the national school often wrote letters of condolence and sent them. When the workers from that village saw the letters sent from their hometown, their work efficiency immediately increased significantly, and their savings also increased.</p>
<p>A brave warrior who survived the Nomonhan Incident also came to work. When he entered the workplace, he first expressed his gratitude to the predecessors who made aircraft, and then silently cleaned three rooms by himself. He silently moved towards burying himself in work with the passion of a hundred battles survived, and the performance of the squadron he joined immediately improved. Soon, he was promoted to squadron leader.</p>
<p>But there are certainly those who do not realize the importance of the current situation and therefore do not work hard at their duties. The warriors engaged in production enhancement wake up at five o'clock in the morning and only return to the dormitory to rest around eight or nine o'clock. Their hardships are no less than those on the front lines. The chain of production enhancement sustains such a society. The entire nation unites, encourages them, and moves them, and then miracles constantly appear.</p>
<p>As long as they undergo a single round of motivational speeches, their efficiency will immediately increase significantly. We hope that frontline film news will be shown to them often. Now, plays, movies, entertainment, etc., are no longer the exclusive property of idlers. After hearing words of encouragement, excitement is generated from the bottom of their hearts, and their response is increased production figures clearly placed before us. Those who doubt them, unless they are drunkards lying by the roadside, or those who are not aware of the situation, are our enemies from any point of view.

<h3>A Glimpse of a Light Metal Factory</h3>
<p>The work of this factory is to produce aluminum from alumina. Alumina is a raw material that comes from the South. Using alumina to make bauxite is the work of the 〇〇 factory, and the work of the 〇〇 factory is to make aluminum from bauxite. What aluminum is used for and why it is an important material is probably already known to everyone.</p>
<p>The aluminum industry is a very new industry, especially in Japan, where it has only recently emerged. Therefore, there is a great lack of experts in this field, and it can be said to be completely amateurish. Amateurs often make 180-degree U-turns when doing things. Pushing forward with methods that amateurs consider good allows us to see the extraordinary determination of the factory's executives.</p>
<p>Converting bauxite into aluminum requires removing the oxygen from the bauxite in a powerful electrolytic furnace. Apart from Factory Manager Takeda and Manufacturing Section Chief Yasuda, there is no third person who has actually seen this electrolytic furnace and has experience with it. Under the leadership of these two, they led transferees, wounded veterans, juvenile workers, and other amateur workers to begin construction. Construction had to begin at the same time as operations. The urgency of the situation was such.</p>
<p>Work had already begun in the factory where the roof was not yet completed. On rainy days, they worked while holding umbrellas. The construction work above was still in progress, so cement and sand debris fell sporadically, while below, the electrolytic furnace was already burning red. "When smoke first came out of the chimney, it was very joyous."</p>
<p>Section chiefs recalled the situation at the time, saying. "But we were also very worried. Would the thing we made actually be aluminum? It was like worrying about whether a newborn baby has a complete physical structure." This is the reflection of Factory Manager Takeda. The authorities were deeply suspicious, saying, "Will these amateurs really start working?" But the executives took it upon themselves to "do it first and then talk about it." They resolutely continued. And so they succeeded. All the staff below the executives united as one and buried themselves in hard work.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, when the stars were still shining, work had already begun. There were no Sundays. Nor did they borrow the order for increased production. No matter how many times they rested each month, the executives almost never rested. The current electrolysis section chiefs, etc., have reportedly not rested a single day since November of last year. As for the health of the workers, it is very good. The factory manager's belief is that if a person is busy with work, disease has no way to enter. In fact, the executives are very energetic. Manufacturing Section Chief Yasuda, who is busy with guidance, said while watching the workers working next to the scorching electrolytic furnace: "In this factory, people in administrative positions must also do this work. Therefore, at any time, everyone must be prepared to be a reserve force." In the hundreds of degrees of heat, at first, their hands and faces were burned painfully. But the factory manager took the lead, and no one had anything to say. In the 〇〇 factory, there were some obstacles at first, but after all the workers faithfully and strictly adhered to their posts, they currently have a capacity of twelve points. The section chief said: "No matter how many orders for increased production come down, there is no need to fear."</p>
<p>Here, Factory Manager Nishida also wears work clothes, rolls up his leggings, and labors together. Both factory managers are nearly sixty years old and are veterans of the industry, but they still have the spirit to surpass the youth, which is truly great.</p>
<p>In the 〇〇 factory, under the guidance of Hashimoto, the head of the work section, considerable achievements have been made in each process. Using red alumina to make white bauxite, this factory is naturally divided into red and white. Generally speaking, chemical factories are different from mechanical factories. In this place, there is no large area for hammering hot iron sheets with huge iron hammers, nor is there the noise of rapidly rotating lathes all at once, indicating the tension of work. There is only the guidance of certain chemical changes, connecting like a fixed pattern. Therefore, the number of workers is also very small, and sometimes there is not even one person in a certain place. But when you look closely, there are several workers whose eyes are paying close attention to the degree meter. In order to maintain the healthy state of the entire process and prevent minor illnesses before they occur, the workers watching over the work must not be negligent for a moment.</p>
<p>The workers who patiently guard their posts here are all juvenile workers.</p>
<p>I shared dinner with these juvenile workers in the dining hall of the 〇〇 factory's dormitory.</p>
<p>After finishing the meal, after talking about the Javanese military for an hour, a discussion was held with the factory's executives, and they were all lively and energetic. Among them were brave warriors who captured Palembang. A conversation was also held at the 〇〇 factory. The warden here is a brave warrior from the Tokai Brigade of the Java occupation army.</p>
<p>Aluminum has a wide range of uses, so the spirits of the workers are also high. Transferees are unusually serious about their work and have achieved unexpected results. This large factory has smoothly completed its assigned tasks. (Original by Asano Akira - Translated by Sho from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi)</p>
<h3>A Pilgrimage to the German Defense Line in the Strait of Dover: Unprecedented Slaughter Lurks in the Beautiful Sand</h3>
<p>If the British and Americans were to land in Europe, where would they choose as their landing point? For political reasons, it would seem to be in the Balkans, but from a strategic point of view, it should be the French coast. This is a recent and interesting question. The rumor that the British and Americans will soon land in France is very popular, and the French generally believe it. During this period of rampant rumors, the German authorities stationed in France invited a small number of foreign journalists to inspect the French Atlantic coast and Mediterranean coast in response to the falsehoods of British and American radio propaganda. After a ten-day trip, the reporter will first report on the German army's preparations in the English Channel:</p>
<p>Young Soldiers Sharpened and Ready</p>
<p>As everyone knows, in this war, all defensive equipment is for depth operations and depth equipment.</p>
<p>We set out from northern France and went all the way to the Belgian border, where we saw the German army's depth equipment. Dozens of kilometers away from the coast, in unexpected places, there were tank units and anti-tank artillery units. And here we saw young new recruits who had not yet experienced actual combat, undergoing continuous training. From the occupied areas of the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Italy, the British and Americans are heavily guarded against, and at the same time, these places are large training grounds for ever-changing strategies. Here there are many new weapons, powerful tanks, and the most efficient light machine guns, modified based on experience from the Eastern Front. The young soldiers, full of vigor and enthusiasm, are practicing all day long. Almost all of those commanding them are young officers wearing the Iron Cross for their war exploits.</p>
<p>Beside the fields where they are practicing are the graves of German, French, and Belgian generals and soldiers who died in the previous Great War. There are also graves of British and Canadian soldiers who died in this war. In front of these graves, they offer a beautiful flower.</p>
<p>The Scenic Line of the Strait of Dover</p>
<p>We patrolled the Belgian border in the thick fog that is unique to the English Channel by bicycle. In the twilight, German soldiers wearing steel helmets floated up. The shadows of people coming and going were leisurely and carefree, as if they were unaware of the war.</p>
<p>Ostend, near the French-Belgian border, was the first seaside resort in 19th-century Europe. We spent the night in a small town south of that place, ending our first day's journey. The next day, our inspection started from Dunkirk, famous for the British retreat, to Boulogne, where Napoleon prepared to land on the British mainland. This area is the coast of the Strait of Dover, which is closest to England. The reporter cannot fully describe the details of the German defense equipment in Dunkirk, Boulogne, and Dieppe. However, in the three years after defeating France, the German army has already built a defensive position that is more solid than the Maginot Line, which took France more than ten years to build. It is enough for us to know this. Because the entire coastline is a continuous line of sand dunes that have not changed their shape over the years, the so-called defensive positions are all powerful fortresses of ancient architecture. Behind the sand dunes are old port towns, with canals stretching out under the misty sky. The lament sung in Baudelaire's poem "The Temptation of Travel" is precisely the scenic line of this coast.</p>
<p>Mines Densely Distributed Everywhere</p>
<p>But now, although the rivers and mountains remain the same, the people have completely changed. Behind the scenery that poets yearn for, there is an amazing structure hidden. The undulating coastline has all become a fire net of important anti-aircraft guns and machine guns. The red tiles on the roofs of the fishing huts, which originally seemed so moving in a painting, have become machines that spew flames. Walking along the coast, for several kilometers, it seems that there is not a single defensive position or a single soldier, but the commander who guides us smiles brightly and says, "If the British soldiers come here, they will have a very lucky encounter!" When you look closely, barbed wire and tank defenses are spread everywhere between the sand dunes and the coast. A certain major led us to visit one underground fire net after another, explaining in detail, and everything we saw made us marvel. It is a pity that these facilities cannot all be described with accurate figures. The construction of defenses is not limited to the coastal area, but extends several kilometers inland, with minefields everywhere. Each of these facilities can be defended alone for several months. The soldiers have personally built clean underground hospitals and underground theaters. Wartime and peacetime life coexist here. In one corner of a fire net, amaryllis flowers planted by the soldiers are in full bloom.</p>
<p>Not only among the German troops can we see the vigorous human vitality, but the French residents living in the villages and towns along this coastline also have the same vigorous vitality. Many towns in Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne were reduced to ruins by the bombings of the German and British air forces in 1940. But the people here are reluctant to abandon their hometowns. Vegetable stalls and bakeries have been opened one after another, and the streets are extremely crowded. While passing through a certain town in Calais, we saw a dozen girls playing in a dilapidated courtyard. In the wasteland burned by wildfire, we also saw orchids sprouting.</p>
<p>The Activity of the Todt Organization</p>
<p>The German military's defensive facilities are being strengthened. Workers from Belgium are building new projects under the jurisdiction of the "Todt Organization" (Todt was the former German Director-General of Highways and a national defense engineering expert). There are also women mixed in among them. These conscripted workers also have the ability to fight with weapons when necessary. Many of the soldiers guarding the coast have experienced fierce battles with injuries on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>"Night and fog are what the soldiers consider to be the most difficult things. On days when there is thick fog, the sun hides her body. When they encounter this kind of situation, the soldiers are all deployed and ready, waiting with their spears as pillows."</p>
<p>The major said this. But even in this constant tense atmosphere, there was no gloom on their faces.</p>
<p>In short, in this corner of the English Channel, the German army has exerted the greatest capability of modern defense. Standing on the sand dunes of the English Channel, the reporter looked out with deep emotion and could not help but feel a sense of vicissitude. For centuries, this channel has sustained the various destinies of England and the Continent. Napoleon had pondered for months in Boulogne, planning how to land in England. Now, it has been transformed into a place where the German army is waiting to mobilize. Unprecedented slaughter is lurking beneath this beautiful sand. The sun is gradually sinking in the distance of the gray sea. When will history repeat her fate? (Special dispatch from Paris - Translated by Sho from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, April 4)</p>
<h3>The East Asia Medical Society Holds a General Meeting of Staff</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The East Asia Medical Society opened here on the 17th, with a meeting period of two days. The Society held a general meeting of staff at the Momijikan here at 4:30 p.m. on the 16th. On the organizer side, President Hayashi and Secretary-General Miyagawa attended. On the side of each department, representatives from China, including Chu Minyi, Bao Jianqing, and Haldingberg, representatives from Manchukuo, including Totoku Oohira, representatives from Vietnam, including Gai Aru, and representatives from Thailand, including Lee Sibaayat, totaling forty people, attended. In addition to deciding to hold the third general meeting in Nanjing and the fourth general meeting to be held in Manchuria, the following two proposals were unanimously passed and scheduled to be implemented immediately: 1. To establish new departments in Vietnam and Thailand, with the common task for each department to be the eradication of malaria, coping with tuberculosis, and other prevention of various infectious diseases within the Co-prosperity Sphere, and to nominate responsible persons, establish research groups, and present their results at the next year's general meeting.</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Convene a Near East Economic Conference</h3>
<p>Ankara, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a Cairo dispatch relayed by Stephani, in order to overcome the economic and financial crises that are currently threatening various Near Eastern countries, Britain plans to convene a joint conference of these countries to promote commercial exchanges between them and to take joint action to avoid inflation. The trip of Mr. Cates, the British Minister for Near East Affairs, to the capitals of various Near Eastern countries is solely to prepare for this conference, in order to avoid being preempted by the United States, as the United States has also dispatched a committee to Egypt to investigate the country's industrial needs. According to news from Egyptian economic circles, the American representatives are particularly unwilling to supply machinery and parts to Egypt, and prefer to transport finished products there, knowing that these finished products cannot cross the ocean.</p>
<h3>Burmese Political Party Holds a General Meeting: Ba Maw Attends and Gives a Speech, Urging the Burmese People to Work Together to Achieve Independence</h3>
<p>Yangon, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Burmese Dobama Sinyetha Party held its New Year's General Meeting here today. Party leader Ba Maw gave a speech on the spot, saying in essence: "The independence that we have been praying for for many years will be realized within this year, so this year in Burma can be said to be a year of epoch-making significance. In the past few decades, we have fought with our bare hands to achieve Burmese independence. Thinking of this, I am filled with a myriad of emotions. The reason why Burma is about to become independent is entirely due to the sincerity and friendship of Japan. I, as a party member, express my deep gratitude for this. I believe that in order to repay Japan's deep friendship, the members of our party should unite with the people of the whole country and implement the following four items: (1) In order to defend our homeland, it is an urgent task to establish a defense force, so it should be organized as soon as possible and the army, navy, and air force should be strengthened to complete Burma's defense. (2) In order to realize Burmese independence, in addition to establishing a defense force, the people of the whole country should carry out labor service so that Burma, which has been turned into a waste furnace, can be restored as soon as possible. (3) Men and children who are unable to participate in the above two matters should take on other work, that is, maintain law and order in the rear and abide by the law, and be good wartime Burmese citizens. (4) The sixteen million Burmese people should unite under one order and one command, and strive together to strive for the final victory in realizing independence. The spirit of the people of Japan, Germany, Italy, and other countries to endure all sacrifices in order to win victory is our only model, and I would like to encourage you, the members of our party, to do the same."</p>

<h3>Many British and American Planes Shot Down by Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - It was disclosed here today that in the past 24 hours, German fighters and anti-aircraft guns shot down at least 78 British and American aircraft, most of which were multi-engine bombers. This is the largest victory achieved by Germany in a single battle.

Experts believe that the German night fighters made the greatest contribution in this battle, especially considering the clear weather. The anti-aircraft guns were also quite effective. Last night, heavy fog covered Britain, and it is believed that many damaged British and American aircraft were unable to return safely to their bases.

<h3>Polish Government-in-Exile Calls for Investigation into Whereabouts of Captured Soldiers Held by Soviets; Germany Announces 10,000 Polish Soldiers Massacred by Soviets</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency) - On April 10, German authorities invited a group of defense reporters to the front line near Smolensk, where they publicly exhumed the graves of 10,000 Polish officers and soldiers who had been secretly massacred by the Soviet secret police. After this news was released, public opinion in various countries was greatly shocked. The British government feared that relations with the anti-Axis countries would become more chaotic. Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden hosted a banquet for Polish Prime Minister Sikorski on the 15th to hold earnest talks. According to a telegram from London, the Polish government-in-exile issued a statement on the 16th, calling on the International Red Cross and other impartial national government organizations to conduct a detailed investigation, and the situation is worsening. According to a telegram from Moscow, the Soviet Information Bureau issued a statement on the 16th denying the German authorities' report. However, the German government stated that it was determined to form a defense group to investigate and clarify the truth. According to a telegram from Berlin, the head of the German Red Cross, Dr. Grawitz, invited the International Red Cross on the 16th to cooperate in an on-site investigation to verify whether these corpses were indeed massacred by the Soviet secret police.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from London, the Polish Minister of Defense of the government-in-exile issued the following statement on the 16th: The Soviet newspaper Red Star reported on May 17, 1940, that the Soviet army had captured 100 Polish officers and soldiers in battles on May 17, 1939. According to information obtained by the Polish government, the Soviet Union established three prisoner-of-war camps in November 1939: Kozielsk, east of Smolensk; Starobielsk, near Kharkiv; and Ostashkov, near Kalinin. The Kozielsk camp held 4,500 officers and other prisoners, totaling 5,000 people. The Starobielsk camp held 100 civilians, 5,800 officers, and 6,570 other prisoners. Between April 5 and mid-May 1940, the Soviet authorities dissolved these camps. After the establishment of a treaty and military agreement between the Soviet and Polish governments, when organizing the Polish army within Soviet territory, 7,000 lower-ranking soldiers and civilians went missing, as well as 8,300 officers. Therefore, Ambassador Kot and General Anders requested the Soviet government to investigate the whereabouts of these Polish officers and soldiers. On October 6, 1941, Ambassador Kot twice requested the Soviet government to publish a list of Polish prisoners. On December 3, 1941, General Sikorski visited Moscow and met with Chairman Stalin. During the talks, he requested the complete release of Polish prisoners of war. The Soviet government only stated that the list had not yet been compiled. Our side handed Chairman Stalin a list of 3,843 officers who had been held in one camp. At that time, Chairman Stalin stated that the amnesty for Polish people applied to both military personnel and civilians. The Soviet side also claimed that all Polish officers had been released. Subsequently, in March 1942, General Anders again handed Chairman Stalin an additional list of 800 officers. None of the Polish officers listed on that list have returned. Foreign Minister Raczynski also repeatedly informed Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov to inquire about the news of the prisoners. The Polish government has not yet received a response from the Soviet side regarding the whereabouts of these prisoners. Germany discovered the bodies of thousands of Polish officers near Smolensk. The German government's intelligence specifically stated that these officers were brutally murdered by the Soviet secret police in the spring of 1940. Therefore, the International Red Cross must investigate this discovered public cemetery and clarify the truth. The Polish government is now requesting the organization to send representatives to the locations where Polish prisoners of war were massacred to investigate and clarify the truth.</p>

<h3>Readers' Forum – Request the Authorities to "Comfort the People's Hearts" and "Establish National Credibility"</h3>
<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>Since the National Government issued the order to thoroughly investigate hoarding and speculation, we, the ordinary people who are deeply affected by high prices, feel as if we have received a long-awaited sweet rain in the scorching heat, and we feel unspeakable joy and comfort. Although we are concerned about whether it is possible to "thoroughly investigate" and "handle fairly," seeing the status of those responsible for the thorough investigation and the support and encouragement from public opinion, I think there must be some sensational facts to show, and it will never be a flash in the pan, disgracing the mission, because this is related to comforting the people's hearts and maintaining credibility.</p>
<p>But now the person in charge of the investigation has returned to the capital to report on his mission, and what we have seen is only one bank being sealed and closed, and one hoarder being sent to the court for interrogation. Although it is said that "the investigation work is still ongoing," we can imagine the situation in the future from the first investigation. It is like a sky full of dark clouds, but in the end, the wind blows the clouds away, and not even a drop of light rain is seen. Does the government disregard public opinion and let these criminals who harm the people and disrupt society go unpunished?</p>
<p>The call for cracking down on hoarding and speculation has long been filled in society, and recently, friendly countries have also paid great attention to this thorough investigation. Public opinion is also unanimously supporting it. This kind of enthusiasm is a manifestation of the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows in East Asia. If the government indulges and tolerates these criminals, it will not only deeply stimulate the people, but also be despised by friendly countries. Therefore, for the sake of loving the people and thanking the enthusiasm of friendly countries, the government must severely punish the treacherous merchants who hoard and speculate in order to comfort the people's hearts internally and establish national credibility externally. We hope that our wise authorities will show this with facts.</p>

<h3>Extremely Outraged by Ticket Sellers Often Abusing Passengers – Judicial Circles Greatly Shocked</h3>
<p>Mu Adong, a ticket seller on Bus No. 8 on Yangshupu Road, argued with a passenger from Yangzhou named Ma Qingwen (23 years old, a worker in a Yangshupu yarn factory) near Guangxin Road at 7:30 PM on the 9th of this month because the ticket was not given a change. After the ticket inspector questioned them, a big quarrel broke out. As a result, Mu Adong and Shi, the head of the ticket department on another bus, beat Ma. Later, Ma cried and told a friend named Xiao Heipi. When the tram returned from the end of Yangshupu Road, Xiao Heipi asked the ticket seller Mu Adong to get off the bus at Guangxin Road and questioned him, starting a big fight. Then they fought each other, causing Mu's companion, ticket seller No. 2078, to lose his hat. Later, Xiao Heipi and Ma Qingwen, and his friend Yu Shunfu from Ningbo, took the opportunity to escape. The case was discovered by detectives from the Yangshupu Police Station, who arrested Ma and Yu at Ma's home and escorted them to a special court. The lawyer representing the police station filed a public lawsuit for obstructing order and robbery. The judge reprimanded the tram ticket sellers Mu and Shi, saying that it was hateful for them to beat passengers. If they did not change their behavior in the future, they would be detained and punished. As a result, the two defendants were released on bail, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the 22nd. The hat was returned.</p>

<h3>Commentary: Merging Small Banks</h3>
<p>The way this investigation into speculation and hoarding by financial institutions in this city has ended has aroused unanimous dissatisfaction from the public, especially the media. The reason is very simple: we do not want to see the National Government's wartime economic policies failing to achieve their intended effect, thereby undermining public trust. As the Continental Daily News commented on April 11: "People believe that if this investigation ends in a half-hearted and hasty manner, the National Government's economic policy, which has painstakingly established the National Commercial Control Association to embark on the path of national capital self-mobilization, will be obstructed; there is a deep concern that, in the worst-case scenario, it will further promote political and economic antagonism between the government and the people." These words can be said to be a very clear warning, which should be universally remembered by our country, both high and low.</p>
<p>Yesterday's news stated that, in order to thoroughly resolve the hoarding incident, the relevant authorities have decided to take decisive action against those who violate government laws and disrupt the social economy in their business operations. At the same time, they have decided to merge some small banks. Indeed, many new banks have been established in this city in recent years, forming a separate force in the banking sector. Although many of them may not necessarily be determined to be illegitimate, at least some of them are not "not engaged in illegitimate businesses." In view of the idioms "He who touches pitch shall be defiled" and "One rotten apple spoils the barrel," we believe that, after confirming that small banks are indeed engaged in illegitimate businesses, it would be better to close them down decisively rather than merge them, which would create a comprehensive collusion.</p>
<p>According to Article 8, Sections 4 and 8, of the Shanghai Banking Association's articles of association, the obligations of member banks of the association are to "respond to the association's consultations and investigations" and "not engage in illegitimate businesses." Therefore, all banks belonging to the Banking Association, whether government-run or privately-run, large or small, should be uniformly instructed by the government authorities to have local banking associations be responsible for assisting in the investigation and reporting impartially on whether their member banks are engaged in illegitimate businesses. As for the responsibility for punishment, it naturally belongs to the government authorities.</p>

Therefore, the National Government has successively promulgated the National Commercial Control Association and the Industrial Trade Association Organization Regulations, established the Commercial Control Association, and organized joint associations of various industries in order to complete the wartime economic system. The various major industrial and commercial trade associations should consolidate the organization and strive for a balance between production and sales and stabilize prices, and not fail the expectations of the government and the public, etc.</p>

<p>Also, according to a secret report received by the bureau yesterday, illegal merchants were secretly engaged in black market transactions of cotton yarn and cloth in the Siyang Teahouse in Wujiaochang, Huxi, in this city. The bureau dispatched personnel to the scene yesterday morning (17th) at about 10:00 AM, together with the police station in charge, and apprehended more than 40 black market merchants on the spot, and brought them to the police station for investigation in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>After Investigating Hoarding and Suppressing Prices: Futong Bank Suspends Operations in Compliance with Orders, Bank Strictly Handles Mortgage Loans, Implements Investigation of Godowns and Warehouses for Inventory</h3>
<p>After the authorities investigated the loan account books of various banks and financial institutions in order to take action in response to the crackdown on hoarding and suppress prices, the Futong Commercial Bank at No. 422 Hankou Road, which was suspected of being seriously involved in hoarding materials and disrupting the market through the unregistered Zhenhua Company, was ordered to temporarily suspend operations for investigation. The bank has complied with the order, but the deposits of all depositors will still be paid as usual without restrictions.</p>
<p>Mortgage Loans Strictly Handled</p>
<p>For the purpose of prudently handling all loans by various banks and financial institutions, the selection of pledges shall be limited to those that do not violate current laws and regulations and do not promote hoarding and speculation. It is also stipulated that for goods that are subject to control and have limited prices, the discount shall not be higher than 60% of the limited price. For real estate as collateral, the discount shall not be higher than 50% of the assessed value. For goods with unlimited prices, the discount shall not be higher than 30% of the market price.

<p>Investigate Godowns and Warehouses for Inventory</p>
<p>In order to eliminate speculation and hoarding, the warehouses of various banks and financial institutions, as well as various godowns and storage companies, shall be thoroughly investigated. All items stored, regardless of their nature or type, shall be reported to the authorities before April 30, specifying the name, address, and quantity of the owner of each batch of goods, and the date of storage, etc. It is said that all warehouses and godowns have been reporting in accordance with the warehouse crackdown rules and government announcements.

<h3>Noodle Food Industry: Monthly Demand for 160,000 Bags of Flour, Request Authorities to Allocate Soon</h3>
<p>The Noodle Food Industry Trade Association of this city, after being approved by the authorities to merge the trade associations of cut noodles, oil-cooked cooked food cakes, buns, and fritters, etc., began handling the general registration on the 6th of this month, with a total of 2,808 members. In order to request the authorities to resume the allocation of flour as soon as possible to maintain the business of the industry, they complied with the order to investigate the monthly demand of the industry for verification. The association completed the investigation and reported it in writing the day before yesterday, totaling 161,070 bags, of which the cut noodle group needs three bags per store per day, and the flatbread fritter group, etc., needs one or two bags per store per day. The authorities have expressed acceptance and will consider it appropriately.</p>
<h3>After Strictly Cracking Down on Hoarding: Land Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Since the government authorities strictly inspected the hoarding incidents in this city and strengthened various controls, the market situation in this city has become much more stable. In recent days, the prices of various goods have not experienced violent increases or decreases. However, real estate prices have risen instead. Since the Japanese authorities completed the procedures for lifting the disposal of enemy properties, real estate transactions in this city have become slightly more active from a state of extreme stagnation, and prices have also risen accordingly. In recent days, due to the authorities' supervision of hoarding, those with idle funds have dared not engage in hoarding again, so they have shifted their target to real estate transactions, and thus real estate prices have risen rapidly.</p>
<h3>Cotton Products Trade Association: Held a Meeting of Directors and Supervisors Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Industry designated Feng Luzhan and other 50 people as initiators of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Cotton Products Trade Association Joint Association, they actively prepared and convened an initiators' meeting on the 6th of this month, passed the articles of association, and selected Nie Lusheng, Cheng Jingtang, Ding Fangyuan, Tang Zhiliang, Pan Xusheng, Liu Jingji, Jiang Keding, Jiang Yaocheng, Pan Ziqi, Chen Xiping, Lu Yintang, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Guo Qiqing, Rong Erren, Jiang Shangda, and Yu Tinghui as directors, and Wen Lanting, Chen Zhanru, Wang Diwu, Shan Zhirong, Wu Kunsheng, Tong Runfu, and Wang Qiyu as supervisors. Nie Lusheng was elected as the chairman of the board of directors, Cheng Jingtang as the vice chairman of the board of directors, Ding Fangyuan, Tang Zhiliang, Pan Xusheng, Liu Jingji, and Jiang Keding as standing directors, and Wen Lanting as the chairman of the board of supervisors. After the organization was established, it has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for record and is being issued with a seal. Yesterday, the first meeting of directors and supervisors was held at the Yarn Mill Association to discuss the direction of association affairs, and the association's office was established at No. 88 Bowuyuan Road, and began operations immediately.</p>
<h3>Translation: Public Opinion Trends on the Hoarding Incident</h3>
<p>The hoarding issue has become a completely political issue, giving the various levels of people in the concession a serious shock. What the various sectors of the concession hope for from the National Government was initially a partial hope and claim, "strictly punish hoarders." Now this partial hope has turned into a political request, "hoping that the National Government will renew the national guiding spirit, practice clean politics, so as to realize true Sino-Japanese cooperation and stabilize people's livelihood." After investigating hoarding, the National Government's announcement of the punishment of Zhenhua Company, Futong Bank, and the statements of Vice Ministers Chen and Yuan have been highly valued by political and economic figures in the concession. The trends in public opinion are generally as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Chen and Yuan issued a statement on the 14th saying: "This investigation has come to an end. The speculative merchants who hoard may not be limited to Zhenhua Company and Futong Bank. Therefore, the investigation work will continue." However, now is the time to make the order to crack down on hoarding truly authoritative. This time, only punishing small banks and small companies can be said to be catching small fish and letting go of big fish.</p>
<p>(2) People from all walks of life in the concession believe that political factional forces are abusing their privileges to engage in planned hoarding and speculation. Therefore, in order to dispel public doubts, the board of directors, supervisors, capital, and criminal content of Zhenhua Company and Futong Bank should be announced to show that the guiding task in the Shanghai speculative market has been completed and the unrest in the people's minds has been eliminated.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the hoarding incident, it is hoped that the authorities will prevent hoarding at this time with the determination to put righteousness above personal interests.</p>
<p>(4) Regardless of any status, those who engage in activities that disrupt people's livelihood are hoped that the authorities will uniformly impose the death penalty to prevent bad elements from disrupting the market.</p>
<p>(5) The importance of this hoarding incident in politics should not be underestimated. A local operation will not be effective. It should be based on the National Government's spirit of nation-building, and courageously forge ahead to overcome difficulties. Shen Bao, which is regarded as representing general public opinion, published an editorial on the 16th entitled "Catching Small Fish," which expressed its hope that the results of the hoarding investigation would be made public. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>We would like to raise three inquiries regarding this hoarding investigation and request satisfactory answers from the government and the investigators to dispel public doubts.</p>
<p>(1) The National Government's order pointed out the original capital of the companies and banks that were found to have factual evidence of speculation, the amount of funds used for speculative hoarding, and where these funds came from.</p>
<p>(2) Who are the major shareholders and important directors and supervisors of these two commercial firms, and are there any government personnel involved?</p>
<p>(3) If it is believed that the members of these two commercial firms are all "speculative merchants" among pure merchants, then is it absolutely true that no government personnel are engaged in speculative hoarding activities? If the facts are true, but they are not reported or investigated, and are deliberately shielded and concealed, then we believe that this government's order to investigate is an absolute failure.
