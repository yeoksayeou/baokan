<p>社評</p>
<h3>中日文化溝通之道（二）　所望於中日文化協會二次全國代表大會者</h3>
<p>中日間文化的溝通，是今後兩國互助發展的關鍵，所以兩國文化界亟須努力。我們所望於日本文化界者，已於一昨社評掬誠獻言，茲請言中國文化界，尤其是中日文化協會所亟須努力者，以默給出席全國代表大會諸君。</p>
<p>我們說，日本人士研究中國偏重於古代，而忽視現代，當然是比較嚴格的說法，其實日本文化界對於現代中國，也有苦心研究的人士。可是，反觀我國文化界，對於日本問題的研究，則無論是「現代」或是「古代」，所知都限於皮毛輪廓。譬如目前是高唱中日親善最熱烈的時代，試問坊間出版關於研究日本問題的圖書刊物，究竟有多少種？文化界了解日本之不足，已經如此，則一般人民對日本的觀念之澈底的轉移，自更不能求之於旦夕之間，我們敢於斷言：如果這種現象不消除，則所謂中日親善協力，還不免仍是官樣文章與標語口號而已。所以，我們認爲中日文化協會這種組織，便應該痛切的認淸這種嚴重的現象，切切實實的做些溝通中日文化，特別是使中國人認識日本文化的具體工作，標語·口號·傅單·宣言儘可不要，而實際的工作却不可絲毫放鬆。</p>
<p>當前溝通兩國文化最緊要的課題有兩個：一是努力向日本介紹現代中國的知識，一是向中國介紹日本的文化。就前者說，民國以來的文化演變，特別是關於「五四運動」以來的中國新文化運動，表現在政治·外交·經濟·文化和民間思想·意識者，複雜微妙，決非一般外人所能完全了解，我們應該盡力忠實地提供具體的資料，毫無成見偏見地使友邦人士眞正深刻的了解中國現代文化及其動向？後者說，我們自然同時希望友邦人士，也能以光風霽月的態度，忠實地向我們提供了解日本所必需的資料，給予中國人研究日本，特別是研究現代日本這一工作以最大的便利。但更主要的，還在我們自己的努力。我們希望政府常局，中日文協，和民間文化界密切合作，目前亟須舉辦的是：（一）在首都創設日本圖書館，並在各省市公立圖書館附設日本圖書部，可以鼓勵一般人研讀日本圖書及其文化。（二）在各大城市設立日本文化館，經常舉行日本問題講演會，開映日本文化電影，舉辦日本文物展覽會，並普遍敎授日語，進而有計劃地編譯與出版日本圖書刊物。（三）舉辦中日文化獎金，凡對溝通中日文化有特殊成績者，不問其國籍，性別及資格，文化人或出版界，都應給予獎金。</p>
<p>所有這些工作，都是今日溝通中日文化所不容或緩的，當然不是任何一方面所能完成，中日兩國不乏賢明睿智之士，亟應由兩國政府與民間之協力，求其早日實現。而目前的中日文化協會，爲要擔負起領導的食任，就必須加以改革，老實說，現在的中日文化協會，政府人員多於民間文化人，而且政府中對日本文化有深刻研究者，如周作人周佛海氏等亦未參加，實爲憾事。我們認爲這一類文化事業，最好由民間文化界出來主持，而政府只居於指導與輔助的地位。假如我們摯誠的建議，能在最近的將來，成爲事實，而不僅是中日兩國文化前途之大幸，也是東亞文化的光榮。我們特此向全國代表大會致敬，並祝光輝的成功。</p>

<h3>澳門通訊　重慶政權之苛捐雜稅（二）</h3>
<p>— 金彥</p>
<p>增稅名目繁多結果未達預期數額</p>
<p>（五）提高鑛產稅稅率</p>
<p>鑛產稅原係從價征收，除明礬一項征收百分之二外，其他各項，一律以百分之五征收，因各地鑛產品價格多見增高，此項稅牽有酌予抬高之必要，於三十年九月問通令將鑛產物分爲必需品與非必需品兩類，除煤鐵石油三項必需品仍舊征收百分之五外，其餘一律征足百分之十。</p>
<p>惟鑛藏雖豐，開採渚尙不多，因此稅收殊極有限，據統計二十六年實收二百三十九萬八千九百八十二元。二十七年一百零七萬零六百五十九元，二十八年一百八十九萬四千三百五十七元，二十九年二百零七萬五千五百三十五元，三十年一月至六月份計收九十一萬零二百四十一元。</p>
<p>（六）推廣從價稅範圍</p>
<p>以前租稅多係從重征收，物價高漲以來，當局雖曾將各項從量稅稅率酌量提高，但實際稅負仍相形减輕，於是從價稅與從量稅間發生稅負不平之弊，乃於三十年七月七日頒行「貨物統稅暫行條例」及「國產烟酒稅暫行條例」。將各項統稅及烟酒稅一律改爲從價征收，鹽稅之一部份，亦於三十一年九月改爲從價稅，所訂新稅率酒左：</p>
<p>統稅稅率</p>
<p>（一）捲菸—從價征收百分之八十</p>
<p>（二）薰烟—從價征收百分之二十</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>（三）洋酒—從價征收百分之六十</p>
<p>（四）飲料品—從價征收百分之二</p>
<p>十</p>
<p>（五）火酒—普通酒精從價征收百</p>
<p>分之二十改性酒精及</p>
<p>木酒精百分之十，動</p>
<p>力酒酒精百分之五</p>
<p>（六）火柴—從價征收百分之二十</p>
<p>（七）糖類—從價征收百分之十五</p>
<p>（八）水泥—從價征收百分之十五</p>
<p>（九）棉紗—從價征收百分之十五</p>
<p>（十）麥粉—從價征收百分之三•</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>甲·烟類稅分菸葉菸絲兩種，菸葉按照產地核定完稅價格征收百分之三十，菸絲稅征收百分之十五，刨絲之菸葉仍先納菸葉稅。</p>
<p>乙·酒類稅按照產地核定完稅價格征收百分之四十。</p>
<p>鹽稅亦定自三十年九月份起改爲從價稅制巳如上述，規定分產銷兩稅，產鹽塲地征收產稅產稅征實內地，則照各地鹽觔成本征稅百分之四十，產銷兩稅不得盲征自改制後，除產銷兩稅外，其餘，一切正附稅建設專類外債附稅整理費公益費一律取消，據估計單鹽稅一項改制後，稅收每年可由三萬窩元增至六萬萬元。</p>
<p>重慶雖竭力調整舊稅，並屢次提高稅率，但稅收仍無起色。若以二十六年度稅收總額四五四，一五七，四二九元，較二十五年稅收總額八四六，八一一，〇八五元，則短少百分之四十七。二十七年因會計年度改制，自七月至十二月，稅收總額二一〇，〇九四，五三八元。可見舊稅損失之鉅。一般輿論因力主開辦新稅，當局迫於財政之需要，及爲租稅制度計，乃有種種新稅之舉辦計：</p>
<p>（一）過份利得稅</p>
<p>非常時期過份利得稅條例，於二十七年七月二十八日公佈原定自是年七月起征，因一般商民以工商業經戰事影響，尙未恢復，請求展期施行，致遲至二十八年一月一日始行起征，並將原條例規定之營利事業利得免稅點，自百分之十二改爲百分之十五，財產租賃利得稅免稅點原定百分之十，改爲百分之十二，以示體卹之意。稅率最高爲百分之五十。依該條例規定有左列過份利得之一者，除征所得稅之外，並加征過份利得稅。</p>
<p>（甲）公司商號行棧工廠或個人資本在二千元以上之營利事業，官商合辦之營利事業，及一時營利事業，其利得過資本額百分之十五者。　（乙）財產租賃之利得過其財產價額百分之十二者。</p>
<p>營利事業之利得稅稅率如左：</p>
<p>（一）利得額超過資本額百分之</p>
<p>十五至百分之二十者，其</p>
<p>超過額征百分之十。</p>
<p>（二）利得額超過資本額百分之</p>
<p>二十至百分之三十者，其</p>
<p>超過額征百分之十五。</p>
<p>（三）利得額超過資本額百分之</p>
<p>三十至百分之四十强，其</p>
<p>超過額征百分之二十。</p>
<p>（四）利得額超過資本額白分之</p>
<p>四十至百分之五十者，其</p>
<p>超過額征百分之三十。</p>
<p>（五）利得額超過資本額百分之</p>
<p>五十至百分之六十者，其</p>
<p>超過額一律征百分之五十</p>
<p>財產租賃之利得稅之規定</p>
<p>如左：</p>
<p>（一）利得額超過其財產價額百</p>
<p>分之十二至百分之廿者，</p>
<p>其超過額征百分之十。　（二）利得額超過其財產價額百</p>
<p>分之二十至百分之卅者，</p>
<p>其超過額百分之十五。</p>
<p>（三）利得額超過其財產價額百</p>
<p>分之卅至百分之四十者，</p>
<p>其超過額百分之二十。</p>
<p>（四）利得額超過其財產價額百</p>
<p>分之四十至百分之五十者</p>
<p>，其超過額征百分之卅。</p>
<p>（五）利得額超過其財產額百分</p>
<p>之五十至六十者，其超過</p>
<p>額征百分之四十。</p>
<p>（六）利得額超過其財產價額百</p>
<p>分之六十者，其超過額征　百分之五十。非常時期過</p>
<p>份利得稅開征後，二十八</p>
<p>年預算列收數四百萬元，</p>
<p>然至是年底僅收一萬八千</p>
<p>五百七十一元。二十九年</p>
<p>預算仍舊四百萬元，而是</p>
<p>年實收却達二千四百九十</p>
<p>一萬二千六百九十二元，</p>
<p>三十年預算列四千五百萬</p>
<p>元，實收七千七百三十七</p>
<p>萬七千七百九十九元，竟</p>
<p>駕所得稅收之上。</p>
<p>（二）遺產稅</p>
<p>遺產稅暫行條例於二十七年十月六日公佈，開徵則自二十九年一月一日起。依照該條例規定：「凡人於死亡時，在中華民國領域內有遺產者，應徵遺產稅；中華民國人民在本國領域內有住所，而國外有遺產者，亦應徵稅，」是課稅範圍以屬地主義爲主，以屬人主義爲輔也。遺產稅之起稅點定爲五千元，五千元以上者，征百分之一比例稅。</p>
<p>（一）超過五萬元，至十萬元者</p>
<p>，就超過額征百分之二。</p>
<p>（二）超過十萬元至二十五萬元</p>
<p>者，就其超過額征百分之</p>
<p>二。</p>
<p>（三）超過二十五萬元至五十萬</p>
<p>元者，就其超過額征百分</p>
<p>之三。</p>
<p>（四）超過五十萬元至七十五萬</p>
<p>元者，就其超過額　百分</p>
<p>之十。</p>
<p>（五）超過七十五萬元至一百萬</p>
<p>元者，就其超過額征百分</p>
<p>之五。</p>
<p>（六）超過一百萬元至一百五十</p>
<p>萬元者，就其超過額征百</p>
<p>分之七。</p>
<p>（七）超過一百五十萬元至二百</p>
<p>萬元者，就具超過額征百</p>
<p>分之九。</p>
<p>（八）超過二百萬元至三百萬元</p>
<p>者，就其超過額征百分之</p>
<p>十二。</p>
<p>（九）超過三百萬元至四百萬元</p>
<p>者，就其超過額征百分之</p>
<p>十五。</p>
<p>（十）超過四百萬元至五百萬元</p>
<p>者，就具超過額征百分之</p>
<p>二十。</p>
<p>（十一）超過五百萬元至六百萬</p>
<p>元者，就其超過額征百分</p>
<p>之二十五。</p>
<p>（十二）超過六百萬元至七百萬</p>
<p>元者，就其超過額征百分</p>
<p>之三十。</p>
<p>（十三）超過七百萬元至八百萬</p>
<p>元者，就其超過額征百分</p>
<p>之三十五。</p>
<p>（十四）超過八百萬元至九百萬</p>
<p>元者，就其超過額征百分</p>
<p>之四十。</p>
<p>（十五）超過九百萬元至一千萬</p>
<p>元者，就其超過額征百分</p>
<p>之四十五。</p>
<p>（十六）超過　千萬元者，就其</p>
<p>超過額征百分之五十。</p>
<p>由此可見遺產稅稅率是相常輕微，當局之意原在利於推行，故二十九年遺產稅預算數亦僅列二百萬元，是年終征收三千二百二十元，不及預算百分之一。三十年預算列五百萬元，實收二十一萬四千八百七十七元，比上年增七倍餘，雖已大有進展，比諸所得稅過份利得稅論，則遺產稅成績實最不佳。其主要原因，在於稽征困難漏稅過多。嚴格執行財產登記，死亡登記較平時又復不易，是以在財產登記死亡登記水獲充分實施前，遺產稅對戰時財政之增益，必甚有限，不過直接稅系統，至此完全樹立。</p>
<p>（三）戰時消費稅</p>
<p>戰時消費稅暫行條例於三十一年四月二日公布，定自三十一年四月十五日開征，征稅範圍十分廣泛。除生活必須品如米麥等予以免稅，其他一切日用品非必需品奢侈品均課以戰時消費稅，稅率則以貨物性質規定：</p>
<p>（一）普通日用品——値百抽百</p>
<p>分之五。</p>
<p>（二）非必需品——値百抽百分</p>
<p>之十。</p>
<p>（三）半奢侈品——値百抽百分</p>
<p>之十五。</p>
<p>（四）奢侈品——値百抽百分之</p>
<p>二十。</p>
<p>徵課方法，係採通過稅方式，由海關代微。關於此點，曾引起若干輿論之非議。因此而認戰時消費稅爲與厘金差不多之不良稅，其實戰時消費稅祇徵一次，通行全國，與厘金或各省通過稅自不可同日而語。惟徵稅範圍過份廣泛，不免課及生產助成品，致涉苛細。世界各國舉辦消費稅，以法國爲最完備，然終以微及苛細頗引起人民不滿，卒無良好成績，其次課稅貨物，照戰時消費稅條例規定分日用品，非必需品之外，就非必需品奢侈品之間又加一級半奢侈品，共爲四級，實則徒增煩瑣。（三十二年二月二十日寄）</p>
<h3>故人故事</h3>
<p>— 汪精衛</p>
<p>珠江難覓一雙魚，永夜愁人慘不舒。</p>
<p>南浦離懷雖易遣，楓林噩夢漫全虛。</p>
<p>鵑魂若化知何處，馬革能酬愧不如。　凄絕昨宵燈影裏，故人顏色漸糢糊。</p>
<p>辛亥三月三十日（或者四月初一日，記不淸楚）晚間，有獄卒劉一鳴（這是獄卒中對我最好的），覷沒人時，悄悄對我說：「喂，你們又起事了，在廣州殺了不少的頭呢！」我聽了，很難過，請他找一張新聞紙來看。這在獄中，是大干例禁的。難爲他想盡方法，帶得一張來，當我看見胡展堂死事的消息，傷心已極，做了幾首詩，後來承他悄悄對我說：「你那個胡展堂沒有死」，於是中止。其他死事同志，多半認識，總做了兩首詩，第一首「欲將詩思」云云，做得不好，將來要刪，第二首前四句也不好，太空泛，後四句尙是實情，錄之如右。</p>
<p>『故人顏色漸糢糊』，如今隔了三十三年了，自然更加糢糊，只能舉幾個故人的幾件故事，做糢糊記憶之例子。</p>
<p>一個是林時　，福建侯官人。是一個美少年，兩隻眼很大，他自號「獅眼兒」，其實不是，獅眼是圓的，他兩隻眼大而長，比獅眼要好看得多。他有兩三件故事很特別，當時一般同學，買參考書，如山田三良博士的國際私法，小野塚喜平次的政治學大綱等等，都是精裝，黑皮封面，嵌着金字，都鄭重其事的，挿在書架，小心汚損，他也是如此。忽然一日，他將所有的書，都剝了封面，我很詫異的問他，他答：『顧得封面好看，便捨不得讀，捨不得塗，不如剝去，省得可惜。』我翻了幾本，果然亂塗亂抹，笑道：『還好，如果沒有塗抹，你的手掌心也要剝皮哩。』他很窮，有一位姊姊，在浙江，時常寄錢給他。一日，他對我說：『我姊姊寄錢來了，不過駡我爲什麼不寫信？唉！瞎說不好，實說嚇壞了她也不好。』次日，他給我　張畫，道：『你瞧，懂得嗎？我看着第一張，畫他一個人，抱着膝，對着燈，愁容滿面，書几上放着幾片『西京燒』（這是燒白薯，切成片，加些鹽，烤乾，我們夜間讀書之唯一美妙食品）。第二張，畫他一個人，滿面笑容，手裏拿着一封信。第三張，畫他在一株大樹下看書。每張上面，都有『姊姊』兩字，下款『弟　』，月日每張不同。我當時記得，如今忘記了。我看了幾遍，不懂，問他道：「你搗什麼鬼」，他笑道：「第一張，說我心裏想她，又沒有錢，只能吃燒白薯；第二張，說我得了她的信，很歡喜：第三張，說我如今不愁了，自自在在的讀書了；這樣比寫信好得多，又不撒謊，又不累她担心，」我說：「好，只怕她不懂。」他說：「你以爲她和你一樣的牛精嗎」？（牛精是蠢才之極稱）唉！我也有一個五姊，我可沒有林時　那般的風趣，那般善於體貼人情，只落得回國之後，到五姊墳上，去做「斜陽趣歸去，回首斷墳孤」的詩了。</p>
<p>又一個是李文甫，廣東東莞人。他最令我佩服的，是變化氣質。他初入黨時，牢騷到不得了，唯一理由，是不能與聞幹部秘密，幾乎要每天發牢騷，甚至於每頓飯。可是後來他入了幹部，氣質完全變化，幾乎是兩個人。他常常說：「我以前爲什麼麼如此糊塗」？他成爲又謙讓，又虛心，挨駡不回口，任怨不形於顏色；總而言之，由極壞的脾氣，一變而爲極好的脾氣了。我今年六十一歲了，也算見過許多同志，可是像李文甫這樣勇於改過，實在少見，唉！可惜他死得太早！</p>
<p>又一個是喻雲紀，名培倫，四川叙州人。弱不勝衣，在千葉醫學專鬥學校肄業，當時同志中于讀書之聰敏細心，潛心科學，要算他第一。初時製炸藥，只知道銀炸藥，水銀炸藥，一個不愼，把手炸壞了，有半個手掌失了活動能力（是左手抑右手，記不得了），於是精益求精，其他甘油炸藥，黃色炸藥等等都能製造了。發火部分，是鹽酸加里和硫黃；引導部分，是水銀炸藥；主要的爆炸部分，是黃色炸藥等；合三部分而成爲炸彈的內容，是他一手包辦，外面彈壳，要鋼鐵的，也是他一手包辦。電綫也是他一手包辦。他說「只能製造，不能使用，不楚怕死，是我神經不濟，臨時慌張，倒累了你們的事。」不錯，他一到實行的時候，面色發白，手足皆戰，的確不是怕死，是太緊張了！這樣，是不行的！所以當己酉的冬天，到庚戌的春天，我們同在北京，及至佈置好了，他便離開北京，回東京去，可是誰會想到，當辛亥三月二十九日的那一天，他是最勇敢的一個呢！後來聽見黃克强說：當那一天，他是又沈着，又英猛，沒有一些面白手戰的態度。然則變化氣質，不只李文甫一個了！</p>

<h3>評言　金融業與生產事業</h3>
<p>二月十三日中央頒布戰時經濟政策綱領，旣規定行莊放款，限定以生產事業爲對象，故今後行莊，自應傾注全力於生產事業各部門之貸放。顧以目前生產事業之幼稚，非有大規模之經營，與合理化之組織，不足以策事業之進展。是則各銀行錢莊對於生產事業，今後應聯合力量，組織生產貸款銀團，在商業統制總會，市商會，銀行公會，聯合準備會指導之下，廣羅技術人員，規定各種細則，組織工業貸款銀團及農業貸款銀團，積極從事於工農事業之貸款，俾各地生產事業，可作大規模之建立，以輔助統制政策與物資交流之進行。惟着手之始，應先做實地調查，統計，研究，設計等工作，尤其在工程上，會計上，先予以合理的規定：必須其經營科學化，組織合理化，始可予以貸放之便利。不但大規模之事業必須如此，即小工廠，小農塲，以及墾收，漁業，亦應如此，庶幾貸放一種事業款項，必得一種事業之成效，此爲今後金融業惟一之出路，希望各行莊當局加以注意，以期適合政府之經濟政策，完成民間之經濟使命。</p>

<h3>小學教師的隱痛</h3>
<p>— 羣</p>
<p>我怎麼養活孩子？</p>
<p>妻子的肚子，一天天地龐大起來，一副瘦黃的臉，時常帶着憂鬱的眼光，望着我，再看看自已的肚子。我明白她的意思，然而，溫飽尙難的我，那有餘錢來預備生孩子用呢！</p>
<p>人家已經換上了夾袍子，我仍舊是件破碎的棉袍，又熱又重。在這「只重衣杉不重人—的年頭，兼之還執着敎鞭的我，總想做一件來充充塲面，但是，當我看到她那大肚子和瘦黃的臉時，便不得不放棄了成見，省省吧！學校的學費，一再增加，可是，敎員的薪水，却依舊停頓着。所掙的錢，不要說吃飯不够，就連吃粥也勉强！怎有錢來做爸爸，生出孩子以後，我想，我能不能養活我的兒子？</p>
<p>爲了未來的生活，我也曾向親戚告貸過，但是這年頭只有「錦上添花」，誰肯「雪中送炭」？受盡了冷嘲熱諷，仍是空手而還。唉！世熊炎凉，到處勢利！我不滿地駡了起來，然而，這有什麼用呢！</p>
<p>我很慚愧，當了這神聖而又淸苦的敎師，會養不活一個女人，幾年來，我把她的手飾衣服，一件件都交給了別人。她只是嗚咽涕泣，好像舍不得，又不便攔阻，只是哭，來表示她內心的痛苦。我娶了她幾年，沒有給她享過福，相反地只是受苦，雖然大着肚子，那份家務，又不能不管，我每天從學校裏歸來時，總見她滿頭大汗，氣喘地工作着，彷彿不勝其苦。她雖沒有怨言，但我目己感到慚愧！對不起她！</p>
<p>我詛咒上帝，怨恨造物的不平，爲什麼要拿錢財來分出貧富的階級呢？</p>
<p>我恐懼，我擔憂，中國的敎育，會不會破產？我更懷疑，生了孩子後的日子，怎樣渡過？這二個問題，在我的腦海盤施着，找不出答案來。</p>
<p>生孩子了，做爸爸了！這未來的責任，對我是喜，還是悲呢？</p>
<h3>掙扎</h3>
<p>— 海麟</p>
<p>飄了幾天的春雨，還繼續着。</p>
<p>阿龍的一隻汚穢的手，在挖着惺忪的眼，任雨點子冲刷他永沒有機會揩拭的險，但另一隻手中提的一籃子大餅油條倒是有一塊褪了色的油布遮蓋着。</p>
<p>拖着鞋皮在黃包車羣中徘徊：「大餅油條吃哦？」這呼聲傳進每個黃包車夫的耳朶中。特別是他自己，聽得更淸楚。</p>
<p>是中午了，他的呼聲漸漸地低下去。他想：「是餓了吧！」</p>
<p>昨夜服侍了師母的夜麻將，陲下去被還未曾溫暖，就被師父拖了起來。</p>
<p>『懶鬼，快去做生意，各五十，賣不掉小心回來』，就這樣的被推出了店門，他摸一摸大餅，『是冷的，隔了兩天了。』</p>
<p>怎麼賣得掉呢？黃包車夫是絕不會化錢買隔夜貨的。</p>
<p>想了又想，他有點頭昏了，走到墻角，他坐了下來。</p>
<p>『回去吃中飯吧！休想。」</p>
<p>『那麼……』他望了一下籃中。</p>
<p>那隔夜貨現在是變得多麼溫柔啊！他糢糊看見上面有熱氣冒出來。</p>
<p>鵝黃色的油條？撒了芝蔴的大餅？冒香？</p>
<p>肚中的火穿出來了。</p>
<p>一隻手伸進了籃子，但是又立刻縮了回來。師父那滿臉橫肉，那凸出的兇眼，那巨　魔掌，還有師母的那張嘴……都像海怪冒出他的思潮。</p>
<p>他絕望了，抬下頭來……忽聞對過人聲沸騰……他注視一下：</p>
<p>喔！原來是街頭點綴戲劇，一個婦人用脚踢着一個中年乞丐，乞丐嘴中一塊餅……一塊餅，他肚中咕嘰着。閃電似的手，伸進了籃。</p>
<p>現在他嘴中也有一塊餅了</p>
<h3>根</h3>
<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>過了這石壁，路沿着山勢，搬微趨向東北，右手是低低的岡，左手是淺淺的谷，一樣也有着峯迴路轉的意趣。在最狹處，我們只好分開來，由阿五走在前面，大根走在後面。</p>
<p>『去年你生病，我也沒有來看看你。」阿五忽然找到了這個話頭。『後來怎樣好的？現在已完全復原了吧？』又回過頭來看看。</p>
<p>阿五所看見的是一個笑喀嘻的面孔，畏長的，紅紅的，很健康，順便又注意到了一個凸得很出的胸瞠，和一個比自己較高的身材。</p>
<p>大根客氣了幾句，然後說：『還不是就這樣好了，藥也沒有吃。現在似乎比以前還要好些，一天到晚只覺得肚子餓；倒是吃的東西少。我看你很享福，不愁一些吃的。』</p>
<p>『鬼才享福呢，他媽的！』大根的話，又引起了阿五的舊恨。他將黃宗庵的一家駡了一會之後說：『我正想跑出來，不再在他的那裏吃那一碗牢飯。但是我出來之後，做什麼呢，我不知道。有人約我到『隊』裏去，我沒有決定，大根哥，你看怎樣。</p>
<p>『這個我不大慣，』大根說着，用穿着草鞋的脚，將路上一塊小石頭踢到了谷中，『不過我想黃家也不是難過日子的地方吧。黃老太爺肯買我們的田，使我們可以安然過冬，今年還可以有一些種田做工的本錢，我們很感激他。』</p>
<p>『好了，好了！大根哥，』帶着跋重的意味，『你眞是太老實了！他總是要買田的；他乘機剝削你們，你們不知道麼？他媽的黃崇庵是好人，狗也不吃屎了！你便連他的全家，也沒有一個好人！』（二十三）</p>
<h3>消閒哲學</h3>
<p>— 小讀書者</p>
<p>沒們事業觀念的人們最把光陰放在閒字上邊，閒字是一般人的至友，頃刻不離，日裏也閒，夜間更閒，有這許多「閒，」當然需要「消」呀！</p>
<p>咱們同胞最有「閒」的光陰，無論老，無論小，無論男男女女，整天都鑽任閒字中過生活，越過越精，直到今日，我們「消」「閒」的法子，也跟着時代的巨輪突飛孟晋，即掌握近代文明大森旗的洋鬼子，也自嘆不如。</p>
<p>「倌二！打二兩白乾，二塊豆腐乾，一些花生米……」酒送來了，脚一蹺，有鬍子的摸摸鬍子，花上二三個鐘點，二三個鐘點的代價不過二兩白乾，……一些花生米……便宜</p>
<p>茶館是有閒文化的發源地，也是一般人們消閒的大集成，李家的阿毛跟漢子走了，二三點鐘後，立刻連三歲小孩也曉得，自然，茶博士必須每天搜集材料，供給主顧消閒的題目，唷！消閒的集成，可嘆觀止！</p>
<p>「乒乓乒乓……」是麻雀牌聲響，是我們中上下階級老人，少年，太太小姐的消閒；</p>
<p>「這一位蜜斯標緻呀！」</p>
<p>「赤老！」是雄狗追牝狗的形態，是墮落靑年的消閒，在春天更加活躍，在公園中更普遍戲。館，影院，茶室，妓院，跳舞塲，咖啡館，是人們消閒的塲合，白日黑衣，千千萬萬的黑簇簇的人頭，像螞蟻般的蠕動，在研究消閒的方法，在消閒中過日子。</p>
<p>人生是有閒的（？）小孩子爬在地上打彈子，大人們談談風月，賞賞大腿，……閒，消閒是人生目的，消閒是人生哲學罷。</p>
<h3>意志</h3>
<p>— 春生</p>
<p>照心理學的判斷，堅强的意志，有三項必備的條件：精力，恒心，動向。</p>
<p>據說意志的程序和情感的程序一樣，用文字表明出來便無多大意思，因爲文字只適宜於代表思想，意志的要義是在乎能「行」和「堅持」。</p>
<p>意志很多時候是迷朦的，由於意志不能代表整個的人格的緣故，另一種屬於衝動的情感得原動力立刻來代替了它，情感和意志一到抉擇的時候，就促成人的理智而非盲從的態度去執行一種有意識的決斷。理論如此，事實上的要求也是如此。</p>
<p>意志必須和自信心緊携，而自信心難在不可固持己見在頑固的範圍裏。</p>
<p>人有意志，但多有不能做到完美的地步。即使將精力，恒心，動向分成三部來作測騐，最多，我只能獲得三十分，或者在別人的眼光還要來個折扣。</p>
<h3>子夜隨筆</h3>
<p>— 夢</p>
<p>（一）窮</p>
<p>聖天子的像展露出莞爾的笑，夜！蔓延。我沉浸在陰暗的氣氛裏，街上的梆子聲，如胡笳的哀嗚，這夜的陰暗呵！漫漫。我幾曾寗息過，愁潮在腦際榮　。</p>
<p>「穷小子！」接着驟地破空劃來個泥丸。</p>
<p>情緒在混化，滿腔的血，心底蘊藏的炸彈爆發了，蓬，拳頭打在檯上，我摸·痛·覺醒，原來這是夜，忍耐罷★但是，啊！這漫漫長夜，何時……？</p>
<p>（二）憎與恨</p>
<p>祖母！你駡我，打我。我憎，我恨，但是，這憎這恨一忽兒就似陰霾的過去，消失了。是的，祖母，你那時打我駡我的刹那，祖母的心眞比答還難受！</p>
<p>我哭，淚水流滿了我的襟。我默禱。</p>
<p>環境的高壓，使您透不過氣。四圍是枯澀的遭遇，自然要「情鬱於中，發之於外。」了我無用，不能替你分擔這重負，酸酒苦杯，誰來和您分嚐</p>
<p>我應受您的打駡，打罷！駡罷！稍殺您內心的痛苦。</p>

What we expect from the Japanese cultural community was sincerely expressed in yesterday's editorial, and now we would like to talk about what the Chinese cultural community, especially the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, urgently needs to strive for, to silently give to all those attending the National Congress.</p>
<p>We say that Japanese scholars focus on ancient China and neglect modern China, which is certainly a rather strict statement. In fact, there are also people in the Japanese cultural community who painstakingly study modern China. However, looking back at our country's cultural community, the research on Japanese issues, whether "modern" or "ancient," is limited to superficial outlines. For example, now is the era when singing the praises of Sino-Japanese friendship is at its most fervent. May I ask, how many kinds of books and publications researching Japanese issues are published on the market? The lack of understanding of Japan in the cultural circle is already so great, so it is even more impossible to expect a thorough transformation of the general public's perception of Japan overnight. We dare to assert that if this phenomenon is not eliminated, then the so-called Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation will inevitably remain official rhetoric and slogans. Therefore, we believe that organizations like the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association should profoundly recognize this serious phenomenon and earnestly do concrete work to communicate Sino-Japanese culture, especially to make Chinese people understand Japanese culture. Slogans, slogans, leaflets, and declarations can all be dispensed with, but practical work must not be relaxed in the slightest.</p>
<p>At present, there are two most urgent issues in communicating the cultures of the two countries: one is to strive to introduce knowledge of modern China to Japan, and the other is to introduce Japanese culture to China. Regarding the former, the cultural evolution since the Republic of China, especially the Chinese New Culture Movement since the "May Fourth Movement," which is manifested in politics, diplomacy, economy, culture, and folk thoughts and consciousness, is complex and subtle, and cannot be fully understood by ordinary foreigners. We should do our best to faithfully provide concrete information, without any prejudice, to truly and deeply understand China's modern culture and its trends? For the latter, we naturally also hope that friendly people can also provide us with the necessary information to understand Japan with a bright and clear attitude, and provide the greatest convenience for Chinese people to study Japan, especially modern Japan. But the main thing is our own efforts. We hope that the government, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, and the folk cultural circles will cooperate closely. What needs to be done urgently at present is: (1) Establish a Japanese library in the capital, and set up Japanese book sections in public libraries in various provinces and cities, which can encourage the general public to study Japanese books and their culture. (2) Establish Japanese cultural centers in major cities, regularly hold lectures on Japanese issues, screen Japanese cultural films, hold Japanese cultural relics exhibitions, and universally teach Japanese, and then systematically compile and publish Japanese books and publications. (3) Establish Sino-Japanese cultural awards, and give awards to anyone who has made special achievements in communicating Sino-Japanese culture, regardless of nationality, gender, or qualifications, cultural figures or the publishing industry.</p>
<p>All of these tasks are indispensable and cannot be delayed in communicating Sino-Japanese culture today. Of course, it cannot be completed by any one party. There is no shortage of wise and intelligent people in China and Japan. The governments and the people of the two countries should work together to achieve it as soon as possible. And the current Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, in order to shoulder the responsibility of leadership, must be reformed. To be honest, the current Sino-Japanese Cultural Association has more government personnel than folk cultural figures, and those in the government who have profound research on Japanese culture, such as Mr. Zhou Zuoren and Zhou Fohai, have not participated, which is a pity. We believe that this type of cultural undertaking is best managed by the folk cultural circles, while the government only plays a guiding and assisting role. If our sincere suggestions can become a reality in the near future, it will not only be a great fortune for the cultural future of China and Japan, but also the glory of East Asian culture. We hereby pay our respects to the National Congress and wish it brilliant success.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Chairman's Instructions</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st - Chairman's instructions at the first general review of the National Youth are as follows:</p>
<p>Dear youths, today is the day of the establishment of the Chinese Youth Model Corps and the Chinese Youth Corps, and the holding of the first general review of the youth. Youth corps from the capital and North China, Hankou, Guangdong, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Suhuai, and Subei provinces and cities have all come to participate. This shows that the spirit of the compatriots across the country is united, and the spirit of the national youth is also united. At the same time, the youth corps of our friendly nation Japan and the youth corps of our friendly nation Manchukuo have also sent representatives to participate. This further shows that the spirit of the East Asian compatriots is also united. The Greater East Asia War is a war of the entire East Asian nation. The Anglo-Americans are our common enemy. Now that our East Asian compatriots can unite sincerely, become comrades in East Asia, and work together to complete the Greater East Asia War and wipe out the common enemy, this is the most gratifying thing. Youth Corps, you may think that you are just a young man, a teenager, and how can you make any contribution to the country or to East Asia? This view of yours is wrong and must not be allowed. You must know that the responsibility of youth to the country is very important, and the contribution that they can make is also very important. Of course, teenagers are relatively young, but they will also make important contributions to the country in the future. This is true for the country, and it is also true for East Asia. Youth, as long as you all work hard in your respective positions, you will definitely be able to create great strength and produce great results. I believe that you will listen to what I said, be able to endure hardship, be brave, and be diligent, and you will definitely be able to shoulder the mission of reviving China and defending East Asia. To complete this mission, the most important thing is for East Asian compatriots to love each other, and for East Asian compatriots to form comrades. When I saw the vigorous spirit of the Japanese youth during the review just now, I was deeply impressed. Although the number of Manchukuo youth is small, their spirit and actions are also very good. Last May, when I saw the members of the Kyowa Kai Youth Corps in Xinjing, they were very serious and very nervous, and I was deeply impressed. The Chinese Youth Corps is still in the initial stage of organization, and the national general review is only the first time, and today it has such vigor and courage, which I am very comforted by. Finally, I hope that you will keep in mind one sentence, we must take out our own strength, take out our vigor, and take out our courageous spirit, work together, and move forward bravely. We must, as East Asian compatriots, form East Asian comrades and wipe out our common enemy.</p>

<h3>Soviet Wedge Tactic Fails in Ladoga Lake Area - German Defense is Strong, Soviets Make No Progress</h3>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Military Correspondent of the Haitong News Agency, although the northern part of the Eastern Front is now muddy, the Soviet army is continuing its ineffective offensive south of Lake Ladoga. Moreover, the lake will soon thaw, and the Soviet Union will therefore lose an important transportation route, on which the Soviet Union has relied in the past few months to supply and reinforce the defenders of Leningrad. In January of this year, the Soviet army occupied a small swampy area on the south bank of Lake Ladoga, immediately erecting wooden bridges across it and laying narrow-gauge railways on it, but repeated attempts to open traffic were repelled by concentrated German artillery fire. Therefore, the Soviet Union has relied on the frozen surface of Lake Ladoga for transportation with Leningrad. Now that this lake route is about to become impassable due to thawing, the Soviet Union is obviously exerting all its efforts to widen the occupied swampy area so that the narrow-gauge railway can run directly along the south bank of the lake outside the range of German artillery fire. However, all these efforts have so far failed. In recent days, all Soviet offensives have been unsuccessful due to the strength of the German defenses. The Blue Division of Spanish volunteers also occupies a key military position in this battle. In addition, the Soviet offensive in the southwestern area of Vyazma also suffered the same failure. The Soviet army has repeatedly conducted armed reconnaissance in order to determine the strength of the German army in other sections of the Eastern Front. On Sundays, there are only local military actions.</p>
<p>Keijo, Sweden, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to reliable sources on the Eastern Front, the main Soviet forces, on the morning of the 30th, launched fierce attacks with mechanized units from the Leningrad area, the southern part of Lake Ladoga, and the Staraia Russa area on the tributaries of the Neva River. Among them, the Staraia Russa area was particularly intense. According to German front-line news, powerful Soviet mechanized units attempted to break into the German positions at a certain base point using wedge tactics. After the German army met and engaged in a long-term fierce battle, the Soviet army was defeated and retreated, abandoning more than 3,000 bodies. The German army took advantage of the victory to pursue and is still conducting annihilation operations.</p>
<h3>Rommel's African Corps Repels British and American Attempts to Break Through - German Forces Withdraw from Gabès and El Hamma</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to official German information from Berlin last night, the African Corps under General Rommel fought fiercely on Sunday and repelled British and American attempts to break through in southern and central Tunisia. However, German forces have withdrawn from the port of Gabès on the east coast and El Hamma, about 40 kilometers west of the port. This withdrawal is based on a pre-determined plan to shorten the Axis powers' lines of battle. The Allied offensive has not abated, but all attempts by Generals Montgomery and Patton to break through the Axis positions have failed. The American forces under General Patton launched a fierce attack on German positions in central Tunisia and have been blocked in the mountainous area east of Maknassy. According to a Reuters correspondent accompanying the army last night, the American advance east of El Guettar has been delayed by fog and has encountered strong resistance from the Axis forces along the way. British forces operating north of the Djebel Abiod area in the coastal region of northern Tunisia have also encountered similar difficulties. Heavy fog has reduced visibility to only a few yards. Large-scale military action took place in the Béchateur area on Sunday. American tanks attacked German defensive positions with French troops, but were heavily damaged and retreated. American forces also repeatedly attacked near Fondouk, meeting the same fate. According to Berlin sources, the British army, with the help of heavy artillery fire, continued to attempt to encircle the right flank of the Axis positions on the Tunisian coast. Fierce fighting took place on Sunday, and the British suffered heavy casualties and retreated along the entire line. British reconnaissance activities were quite active in the Mateur area on Sunday.</p>
<h3>Eden Goes to Ottawa</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, British Foreign Secretary Eden has been staying at the White House since the 27th, holding talks with Roosevelt, Hull, and others for several days. After holding talks for several hours on the morning of the 30th, he took a plane to Ottawa to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King. According to reports, Eden's mission to Washington has completely failed. As a result, the United States has decided to send a delegation led by Under Secretary of State Welles to London soon to hold discussions with US Ambassador to Britain Winant, Yu Foreign Minister Song Ziwen, Yu Ambassador to Britain Gu Weijun, and Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky on measures to prevent rifts in the Allied camp.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Oran Bay</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Allied headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced on the 30th that Japanese air forces bombed military facilities in Oran Bay again on the night of the 29th.</p>

<h3>Macau Correspondence: The Oppressive Taxes of the Chongqing Regime (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yan</p>
<p>Numerous Tax Increases Fail to Reach Expected Revenue</p>
<p>(5) Increasing Mineral Resource Tax Rates</p>
<p>Mineral resource taxes were originally levied ad valorem. Except for alum, which was taxed at 2%, all other items were taxed at 5%. Due to the increase in prices of mineral products in various regions, it was deemed necessary to appropriately raise this tax. In September of the 30th year, a circular was issued classifying mineral products into essential and non-essential categories. Except for the three essential commodities of coal, iron, and oil, which continued to be taxed at 5%, all others were taxed at 10%.</p>
<p>However, although mineral reserves are abundant, mining is still limited. Therefore, tax revenue from this source is extremely limited. According to statistics, actual revenue was 2,398,982 yuan in the 26th year, 1,070,659 yuan in the 27th year, 1,894,357 yuan in the 28th year, 2,075,535 yuan in the 29th year, and 910,241 yuan in the first six months of the 30th year.</p>
<p>(6) Expanding the Scope of Ad Valorem Taxes</p>
<p>In the past, most taxes were levied ad valorem. Since the surge in prices, although the authorities had moderately increased the tax rates for various quantity-based taxes, the actual tax burden had relatively decreased. This created an imbalance between ad valorem taxes and quantity-based taxes. Therefore, on July 7th of the 30th year, the "Provisional Regulations for Commodity Unified Tax" and the "Provisional Regulations for Domestic Tobacco and Alcohol Tax" were promulgated. All unified taxes and tobacco and alcohol taxes were uniformly converted to ad valorem taxes. Part of the salt tax was also converted to an ad valorem tax in September of the 31st year. The new tax rates were set as follows:</p>
<p>Unified Tax Rates:</p>
<p>(1) Cigarettes - 80% ad valorem</p>
<p>(2) Cured Tobacco - 25% ad valorem</p>
<p>(3) Foreign Liquor - 60% ad valorem</p>
<p>(4) Beverages - 20% ad valorem</p>
<p>(5) Alcohol - Ordinary alcohol 20% ad valorem, denatured alcohol and wood alcohol 10%, power alcohol 5%</p>
<p>(6) Matches - 20% ad valorem</p>
<p>(7) Sugar - 15% ad valorem</p>
<p>(8) Cement - 15% ad valorem</p>
<p>(9) Cotton Yarn - 15% ad valorem</p>
<p>(10) Wheat Flour - 3.5% ad valorem</p>
<p>A. Tobacco Tax is divided into leaf tobacco and shredded tobacco. Leaf tobacco is taxed at 30% based on the assessed taxable price at the place of production. Shredded tobacco is taxed at 15%. Leaf tobacco that is shredded is still subject to leaf tobacco tax first.</p>
<p>B. Alcohol tax is levied at 40% based on the assessed taxable price at the place of production.</p>
<p>The salt tax was also changed to an ad valorem system starting in September of the 30th year, as mentioned above. It was stipulated that there would be both production and sales taxes. A production tax would be levied at the salt production site, and for salt sold inland, a tax of 40% would be levied based on the cost per "jin" (a Chinese unit of weight) in each region. Production and sales taxes could not be levied blindly. After the reform, all other regular and additional taxes, construction special categories, foreign debt surcharges, and public welfare fees were abolished, except for the production and sales taxes. It was estimated that the single item of salt tax could increase annual revenue from 30 million yuan to 60 million yuan after the reform.</p>
<p>Although Chongqing has made great efforts to adjust old taxes and repeatedly raised tax rates, tax revenue has not improved. If we compare the total tax revenue of 454,157,429 yuan in the 26th year to the total tax revenue of 846,811,085 yuan in the 25th year, there is a shortfall of 47%. Due to the change in the accounting year in the 27th year, the total tax revenue from July to December was 210,094,538 yuan. This shows the magnitude of the loss from old taxes. General public opinion strongly advocated the establishment of new taxes. The authorities, compelled by financial needs and for the sake of the tax system, then introduced various new taxes:</p>
<p>(1) Excessive Profits Tax</p>
<p>The Provisional Regulations for Excessive Profits Tax During Extraordinary Periods were promulgated on July 28th of the 27th year. It was originally scheduled to be levied from July of that year. However, due to the impact of the war on industry and commerce, merchants and the public requested a postponement, which delayed the implementation until January 1st of the 28th year. The profit exemption point for profit-making enterprises stipulated in the original regulations was changed from 12% to 15%, and the profit exemption point for property leasing tax was changed from 10% to 12% to show consideration. The highest tax rate was 50%. According to the regulations, those with one of the following excessive profits, in addition to income tax, would also be subject to excessive profits tax:</p>
<p>(A) Profit-making enterprises, whether companies, firms, shops, factories, or individual capital, with capital of more than 2,000 yuan, profit-making enterprises jointly operated by officials and merchants, and temporary profit-making enterprises, whose profits exceed 15% of their capital. (B) Profits from property leasing exceeding 12% of the value of the property.</p>
<p>The profit tax rates for profit-making enterprises are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For profits exceeding 15% to 20% of capital, the excess is taxed at 10%.</p>
<p>(2) For profits exceeding 20% to 30% of capital, the excess is taxed at 15%.</p>
<p>(3) For profits exceeding 30% to 40% of capital, the excess is taxed at 20%.</p>
<p>(4) For profits exceeding 40% to 50% of capital, the excess is taxed at 30%.</p>
<p>(5) For profits exceeding 50% to 60% of capital, the excess is taxed at 50%.</p>
<p>The regulations for property leasing profit tax are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For profits exceeding 12% to 20% of the property value, the excess is taxed at 10%.</p>
<p>(2) For profits exceeding 20% to 30% of the property value, the excess is taxed at 15%.</p>
<p>(3) For profits exceeding 30% to 40% of the property value, the excess is taxed at 20%.</p>
<p>(4) For profits exceeding 40% to 50% of the property value, the excess is taxed at 30%.</p>
<p>(5) For profits exceeding 50% to 60% of the property value, the excess is taxed at 40%.</p>
<p>(6) For profits exceeding 60% of the property value, the excess is taxed at 50%. After the excessive profits tax during extraordinary periods was levied, the budgeted revenue for the 28th year was 4 million yuan, but only 18,571 yuan was collected by the end of the year. The budget for the 29th year remained at 4 million yuan, but the actual revenue for that year reached 24,912,692 yuan. The budget for the 30th year was 45 million yuan, with actual revenue of 77,377,799 yuan, even surpassing income tax revenue.</p>
<p>(2) Inheritance Tax</p>
<p>The Provisional Regulations for Inheritance Tax were promulgated on October 6th of the 27th year, with collection starting on January 1st of the 29th year. According to the regulations: "If a person has inheritance within the territory of the Republic of China at the time of death, inheritance tax shall be levied; if a citizen of the Republic of China has a residence within the territory of the country and has inheritance abroad, tax shall also be levied." The scope of taxation is mainly based on the principle of territoriality and supplemented by the principle of nationality. The starting point for inheritance tax is set at 5,000 yuan, and those above 5,000 yuan are subject to a proportional tax of 1%.</p>
<p>(1) For amounts exceeding 50,000 yuan up to 100,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 2%.</p>
<p>(2) For amounts exceeding 100,000 yuan up to 250,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 2%.</p>
<p>(3) For amounts exceeding 250,000 yuan up to 500,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 3%.</p>
<p>(4) For amounts exceeding 500,000 yuan up to 750,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 10%.</p>
<p>(5) For amounts exceeding 750,000 yuan up to 1,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 5%.</p>
<p>(6) For amounts exceeding 1,000,000 yuan up to 1,500,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 7%.</p>
<p>(7) For amounts exceeding 1,500,000 yuan up to 2,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 9%.</p>
<p>(8) For amounts exceeding 2,000,000 yuan up to 3,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 12%.</p>
<p>(9) For amounts exceeding 3,000,000 yuan up to 4,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 15%.</p>
<p>(10) For amounts exceeding 4,000,000 yuan up to 5,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 20%.</p>
<p>(11) For amounts exceeding 5,000,000 yuan up to 6,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 25%.</p>
<p>(12) For amounts exceeding 6,000,000 yuan up to 7,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 30%.</p>
<p>(13) For amounts exceeding 7,000,000 yuan up to 8,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 35%.</p>
<p>(14) For amounts exceeding 8,000,000 yuan up to 9,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 40%.</p>
<p>(15) For amounts exceeding 9,000,000 yuan up to 10,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 45%.</p>
<p>(16) For amounts exceeding 10,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 50%.</p>
<p>It can be seen from this that the inheritance tax rate is relatively low. The authorities originally intended to facilitate its implementation. Therefore, the budgeted amount for inheritance tax in the 29th year was only 2 million yuan. The year-end collection was 3,220 yuan, less than 1% of the budget. The budget for the 30th year was 5 million yuan, with actual revenue of 214,877 yuan, an increase of more than seven times compared to the previous year. Although there has been great progress, compared to income tax and excessive profits tax, inheritance tax performance is the worst. The main reasons are the difficulty in tax collection and excessive tax evasion. Strict enforcement of property registration and death registration is more difficult than usual. Therefore, before property registration and death registration are fully implemented, the benefit of inheritance tax to wartime finances will be very limited. However, the direct tax system has now been fully established.</p>
<p>(3) Wartime Consumption Tax</p>
<p>The Provisional Regulations for Wartime Consumption Tax were promulgated on April 2nd of the 31st year and were scheduled to be levied from April 15th of the 31st year. The scope of taxation is very broad. Except for necessities such as rice and wheat, which are exempted from tax, all other daily necessities, non-essential goods, and luxury goods are subject to wartime consumption tax. The tax rate is determined by the nature of the goods:</p>
<p>(1) Ordinary Daily Necessities - 5% ad valorem</p>
<p>(2) Non-Essential Goods - 10% ad valorem</p>
<p>(3) Semi-Luxury Goods - 15% ad valorem</p>
<p>(4) Luxury Goods - 20% ad valorem</p>
<p>The method of collection is to adopt a "pass-through tax" approach, collected by the customs authorities. Regarding this point, some public opinion has criticized it. Therefore, wartime consumption tax is considered a bad tax similar to "lijin" (internal transit tax). In fact, wartime consumption tax is only levied once and is valid throughout the country, which is different from "lijin" or transit taxes in various provinces. However, the excessively broad scope of taxation inevitably affects production aids, leading to nitpicking. Among countries worldwide that levy consumption taxes, France is the most comprehensive, but it has ultimately failed due to widespread public dissatisfaction with the nitpicking. Secondly, the taxed goods are divided into daily necessities and non-essential goods according to the Wartime Consumption Tax Regulations. In addition to non-essential goods, a semi-luxury category is added between non-essential and luxury goods, totaling four levels, which actually only increases complexity.

<h3>Story of an Old Friend</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>It is hard to find a pair of fish in the Pearl River,</p>
<p>A night of sorrow makes me suffer unbearably.</p>
<p>Although parting feelings at Nanpu are easy to dispel,</p>
<p>Nightmares in Maple Forest are empty and meaningless.</p>
<p>If the cuckoo's soul transforms, where would it go?</p>
<p>I am ashamed to not be able to repay my debt like soldiers who die on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Desolate and tragic in the lamplight last night,</p>
<p>The appearance of old friends gradually fades.</p>
<p>On the evening of the thirtieth day of the third month of the Xinhai year (or perhaps the first day of the fourth month, I don't remember clearly), a jailer named Liu Yiming (who was the best to me among the jailers) quietly said to me when no one was around, "Hey, you guys have started another uprising, and a lot of heads have been chopped off in Guangzhou!" I was very sad when I heard this and asked him to find a newspaper for me to read. This was a major violation of the prison rules. He managed to bring one in. When I saw the news of Hu Zhantang's death, I was extremely saddened and wrote several poems. Later, he quietly told me, "That Hu Zhantang of yours is not dead," so I stopped. I knew most of the other comrades who had died, and I wrote two poems for each of them. The first one, "I want to use poetic thoughts," etc., was not well written and will be deleted in the future. The first four lines of the second poem are also not good, too vague, but the last four lines are factual, so I am recording them below.</p>
<p>"The appearance of old friends gradually fades." Now, thirty-three years have passed, and naturally it has become even more blurred. I can only offer a few stories of old friends as examples of vague memories.</p>
<p>One is Lin Shishi, from Houguan, Fujian. He was a handsome young man with very large eyes. He called himself "Lion Eyes," but he wasn't. Lion's eyes are round, but his eyes were large and long, much prettier than lion's eyes. He had two or three very special stories. At the time, most students bought reference books, such as Dr. Yamada Saburo's Private International Law and Onozuka Kiheiji's Outline of Political Science, which were all hardcover, black leather covers, with gold lettering, and carefully placed on the bookshelf, afraid of getting them dirty. He did the same. Suddenly, one day, he stripped off the covers of all his books. I asked him in surprise, and he replied, "If I care about the covers being beautiful, I won't bear to read them, won't bear to scribble on them. It's better to strip them off and save the pity." I flipped through a few books and, sure enough, they were covered in doodles. I laughed and said, "It's a good thing you scribbled on them. If you hadn't, you would have peeled the skin off your palms." He was very poor, and he had an older sister in Zhejiang who often sent him money. One day, he said to me, "My sister sent money, but she scolded me for not writing letters. Alas! It's no good lying, but telling the truth would scare her." The next day, he gave me three paintings and said, "Look, do you understand? I drew him alone in the first picture, hugging his knees, facing the lamp, with a sorrowful expression. There are a few slices of 'Xijing Roasted' on the desk" (this is roasted sweet potato, cut into slices, with some salt added, and dried, our only wonderful food when studying at night). The second picture shows him alone, full of smiles, holding a letter in his hand. The third picture shows him reading under a large tree. Each picture has the words 'Sister' on top and 'Brother X' at the bottom, with different dates on each picture. I remember it at the time, but now I've forgotten. I looked at it several times and didn't understand. I asked him, 'What are you up to?' He laughed and said, 'The first picture says that I miss her and don't have any money, so I can only eat roasted sweet potatoes; the second picture says that I received her letter and am very happy; the third picture says that I am not worried anymore and am studying leisurely. This is much better than writing letters, because I'm not lying and I'm not making her worry.' I said, 'Good, but I'm afraid she won't understand.' He said, 'Do you think she's as stupid as you?' (The ultimate insult for a dullard). Alas! I also have a fifth sister, but I'm not as witty as Lin Shishi, nor am I as good at understanding people's feelings. I only ended up going to my fifth sister's grave after returning to the country to write the poem, "The slant sun urges me to return, I turn my head to see a lonely grave."</p>
<p>Another is Li Wenfu, from Dongguan, Guangdong. What I admired most about him was his transformation of temperament. When he first joined the party, he complained incessantly. The only reason was that he couldn't hear the secrets of the cadres. He almost complained every day, even at every meal. But later, after he became a cadre, his temperament completely changed, almost like two different people. He often said, "Why was I so confused before?" He became humble and open-minded, never arguing back when scolded, and never showing resentment on his face. In short, he changed from an extremely bad temper to an extremely good one. I am sixty-one years old this year, and I have seen many comrades, but it is rare to see someone as brave as Li Wenfu in correcting their faults. Alas! It's a pity he died so young!</p>
<p>Another is Yu Yunji, whose given name was Peilun, from Xuzhou, Sichuan. He was frail and delicate. He studied at the Chiba Medical College. At the time, among the comrades, he was the most intelligent, meticulous in his studies, and devoted to science. In the beginning, he only knew how to make silver fulminate and mercury fulminate. Once, he accidentally blew up his hand, and half of his palm lost its mobility (I don't remember if it was his left or right hand). So he refined his skills, and he could make other nitroglycerin explosives, yellow explosives, etc. The ignition part was potassium chlorate and sulfur; the guiding part was mercury fulminate; the main explosive part was yellow explosives, etc. He took care of all three parts to create the contents of the bomb. He also took care of the outer shell, which had to be made of steel. He also took care of the wiring. He said, "I can only make it, but I can't use it. It's not that I'm afraid of dying, it's just that my nerves are not good, and I panic at the last minute, which would ruin your plans." Indeed, when it came time to implement it, his face would turn pale and his hands and feet would tremble. It wasn't that he was afraid of dying, it was just that he was too nervous! This wouldn't work! So, from the winter of the Jiyou year to the spring of the Gengxu year, we were together in Beijing, and after everything was arranged, he left Beijing and returned to Tokyo. But who would have thought that on that day, March 29th of the Xinhai year, he would be the bravest one! Later, I heard Huang Kecheng say that on that day, he was calm and heroic, without any sign of a pale face or trembling hands. So, Li Wenfu wasn't the only one who transformed his temperament!</p>
<p>"The appearance of old friends gradually fades." I am writing down these blurred memories under the lamp to pass this Lantern Festival night of the old calendar.</p>
<p>Under the lamp on February 19th of the 32nd year.</p>

<h3>Those Coming to Shanghai from Other Areas Without Identification Papers Can Hide in the French Concession; If Discovered, the Head of the Household and the Lianbao Chief Will be Punished; Sub-tenants Renting Must Be Investigated by the Baojia Chief</h3>
<p>According to information from the Baojia side of the French Concession, any citizens coming to Shanghai from other areas who request the issuance of an identification card must attach a citizen's card or county resident's card issued by the other area. Those without the above certificates are not allowed to hide within the Concession. If there are such people of unknown origin or mixed backgrounds hiding within the Concession, the head of the household (second landlord) and the Lianbao chief will be severely punished. If people from other areas come to Shanghai to work and live and have a citizen's card or county resident's card issued by the other area, the procedures for requesting the issuance of an identification card can be handled directly at the Lianbao office. This measure is to prevent the Baojia chief from being lenient or deliberately harboring suspects. As for sub-tenants, they are not allowed to arbitrarily sublet or share their rooms with others. If it is necessary to sublet, the consent of the head of the household must be obtained first, and then reported to the Baojia chief. The Baojia chief will complete the investigation procedures and, if it is determined that subletting is possible, only then can it be sublet to others. Furthermore, the second landlord (head of household) is absolutely not allowed to allow people who have not applied for a transfer certificate to reside. If such an event occurs, once discovered, the second landlord (head of household) will be subject to the most severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Those Going from Shanghai to Suzhou and Other Places Must Prepare Two Types of Certificates: Smallpox Vaccination Certificate and Epidemic Prevention Certificate</h3>
<p>When going from Shanghai to other areas, in addition to a citizen's card or residence certificate, a smallpox vaccination certificate must also be prepared. This regulation has been in effect for a long time. However, according to an investigation by a Datong News Agency reporter, residents who wish to travel to places along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line, such as Suzhou and Wuxi, recently need to prepare an additional epidemic prevention certificate. As for going from Shanghai to Ningbo, the requirement to prepare a smallpox vaccination certificate and an epidemic prevention certificate has been in effect for some time.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw and Taxi Prices</h3>
<p>Since the gasoline shortage, the rickshaw business in the city has developed considerably. The establishment of rickshaw companies is like bamboo shoots after a rain. The industry has also followed orders to organize an industry association. To adjust rickshaw fares within the industry and achieve uniformity, the association has formulated rickshaw fares, which will be implemented from the 5th of this month.</p>
<p>Newly Revised Fares</p>
<p>(1) Minimum fare for 30 minutes: (A) Double-seat covered rickshaw: 12 yuan; (B) Single-seat covered rickshaw: 8 yuan; (C) Double-driver sedan rickshaw: 16 yuan; (D) Single-driver sedan rickshaw: 14 yuan. (2) Every 5 minutes exceeding the minimum: (A) Double-seat covered rickshaw: 1.5 yuan; (B) Single-seat covered rickshaw: 1 yuan; (C) Double-driver sedan rickshaw: 1.5 yuan; (D) Single-driver sedan rickshaw: 1.5 yuan. (3) Per hour: (A) Double-seat covered rickshaw: 21 yuan; (B) Single-seat covered rickshaw: 14 yuan; (C) Double-driver sedan rickshaw: 25 yuan; (D) Single-driver sedan rickshaw: 23 yuan.</p>
<p>Points to Note</p>
<p>(1) Of the above fares, the company and the rickshaw puller will split the revenue in three parts: the company gets 20%, and the rickshaw puller gets 10% (including wages and tips). (2) An exception is made for double-driver sedan rickshaws, where the company and the rickshaw puller split the revenue equally at 50% each. (3) Rickshaw pullers are absolutely not allowed to solicit tips from customers. (4) If rickshaw pullers make extra demands, it can be reported to the company for strict punishment.</p>
<p>Branch Station Licensing</p>
<p>All rickshaw companies in this port that have branch stations and open-air branch stations such as dance venues must obtain a license from the Public Works Department. (Excluding the 19 open-air branch stations stipulated by the Bureau). The department announced this last month, and the Traffic and Air Defense Section of the Public Works Department Police Headquarters notified all companies. However, as of the day before yesterday, most companies had not followed the regulations. The section is now going to confiscate the business of companies that have not applied for a license.</p>

<h3>Municipal Social Welfare Bureau Mediates Rent Disputes</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, officially established at the beginning of last month, is reportedly paying close attention to the ongoing occurrence of rent disputes throughout the city. Recognizing that landlords often cut off water and electricity supply due to unsuccessful rent increases, leading to complex problems, the bureau, feeling responsible to the people, is unwilling to stand idly by. It has decided to find ways to resolve these issues. Therefore, landlords or tenants from all walks of life who encounter various problems and cannot resolve them through negotiation can directly request mediation from the bureau. Once the bureau receives requests from all parties, it will immediately summon both sides for questioning and impartially mediate.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office Held Transfer Ceremony of Enemy Assets Yesterday; Transfer Procedures Scheduled Separately for Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 2:00 PM, authorities from friendly nations, together with the Enemy Assets Management Office of our country, held a transfer ceremony of enemy assets at the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office. The transfer personnel from both sides agreed that starting from April 1st, transfer and handover procedures would be carried out separately at various enemy asset agencies. Mr. Zhang Suomin, the director of the Enemy Assets Management Office of the Ministry of Finance, stated briefly in his address: "After my inspection, I have one overriding impression, which is that I deeply admire the method of managing enemy assets by friendly nations. This is because friendly nations assign specialists to manage each type of enemy asset. These specialists are generally from famous large Japanese companies, and their expertise in management goes without saying. Today, friendly nations are transferring the first batch of enemy assets. I would like to report to everyone the principles of the takeover. First, I will seek the consent of the various companies originally entrusted to operate by friendly nations and continue to entrust them to operate, except for those where the conditions differ too greatly. Second, for those entrusted to Chinese operators, industrialists with outstanding credit will be selected. Third, for factories that have been shut down, efforts will be made to restore their operations, except in cases where there are special factual difficulties, in order to increase wartime production. I would like to express my special gratitude to the embassy and naval and army authorities of friendly nations."</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Reception for Reporters</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy holds receptions for the local Chinese press corps every Wednesday.

<h3>Fundraising for Police Posts in Nanshi</h3>
<p>Regarding the police posts of the Nanshi Self-Defense Corps, since the corps headquarters actively planned for their construction, 396 units have already been completed in the entire district. However, according to the actual situation, 124 units are still lacking due to limited funding and the inability to complete all of them. The Nanshi Branch of the Police Department of the Friendly Nation's Consulate, in order to promote the early completion of police posts throughout the district and jointly strengthen local security, has specifically designated donation books to be collected by the corps headquarters from residents of friendly nations residing in the Nanshi district for the purpose of early success. Mr. Wang Delin, the commander of the corps headquarters, has specifically instructed the heads of each neighborhood, the chiefs of the security associations, and the patrol officers to carry the designated donation books of the police department, accompanied by translators, to start collecting donations according to the listed details.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Reorganized into Security Office by Order</h3>
<p>In accordance with the General Outline of the Organization of Security Teams in Various Provinces and Cities, which has been promulgated and implemented by the National Government, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, upon receiving the order, immediately began preparations. In addition to Mayor Chen being concurrently appointed as commander and Mr. Xu Jinyuan, the original chief of staff of the headquarters, being appointed as director of the Security Office, the remaining internal organizational structure and important personnel are reportedly being adjusted. Most of the original directors of various departments are expected to retain their positions. It is also reported that the Garrison Headquarters is actively handling closing matters. Once the closing is completed, the Security Office will be formally established.</p>

<h3>Commentary: The Financial Industry and Production Enterprises</h3>
<p>On February 13th, the Central Government promulgated the Outline of Wartime Economic Policies, which stipulated that loans from banks and money shops should be limited to production enterprises. Therefore, in the future, banks and money shops should devote all their efforts to lending to various sectors of production. Considering the current immaturity of production enterprises, large-scale operations and rationalized organizations are needed to promote the development of enterprises. Therefore, banks and money shops should jointly organize production loan syndicates under the guidance of the General Chamber of Commerce Control, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and the Joint Reserve Committee. They should recruit technical personnel, set various detailed rules, and organize industrial loan syndicates and agricultural loan syndicates to actively engage in lending to industrial and agricultural enterprises so that large-scale production enterprises can be established in various regions to assist the control policy and the exchange of materials. However, at the beginning, practical investigations, statistics, research, and design work should be done, especially in engineering and accounting, rational regulations should be made first: they must be operated scientifically and organized rationally before lending convenience can be granted. Not only large-scale enterprises must do this, but also small factories, small farms, as well as reclamation, fishery, should do the same, so that the loan of a business is sure to have the effect of a business, which is the only way out for the financial industry in the future. Hope that the relevant authorities of the banks and money shops pay attention to, in order to adapt to the government's economic policy and complete the economic mission of the people.</p>

<h3>The Hidden Pain of Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>— Qun</p>
<p>How do I support my child?</p>
<p>My wife's belly is getting bigger day by day. Her thin, yellow face often looks at me with melancholy eyes, then looks at her own belly. I understand what she means, but it is difficult for me to even have enough food and clothing. How can I have extra money to prepare for childbirth!</p>
<p>People have already put on their lined robes, but I am still wearing a tattered cotton robe, which is both hot and heavy. In this day and age where "people are judged by their clothes," and I am still holding onto the teaching position, I always want to make one to fill the facade, but when I see her big belly and thin yellow face, I have to give up my prejudices. Let's save some money! The school fees have been increasing again and again, but the teachers' salaries are still stagnating. The money earned is not enough to eat, let alone drink porridge! How can I afford to be a father? After the child is born, I wonder if I can support my son?</p>
<p>For the sake of future life, I have also asked relatives for loans, but in this year only "icing on the cake", who would be willing to "help in need"? After suffering cold ridicule, still returned empty-handed. Alas! The world is cold and treacherous, full of snobbery! I scolded impatiently, but what's the use!</p>
<p>I am ashamed, I have been a sacred and poor teacher, and I can't afford to support a woman. Over the years, I have given her jewelry and clothes to others one by one. She just sobbed and wept, as if reluctant, but inconvenient to stop, just crying, to express her inner pain. I married her for several years, and I have not given her any happiness, but on the contrary, she has only suffered. Even though she is pregnant, she cannot ignore the housework. When I return from school every day, I always see her working with sweat all over her face and panting, as if she can't bear it anymore. Although she has no complaints, I feel ashamed myself! I am sorry for her!</p>
<p>I curse God, resent the injustice of the Creator, why do we have to divide the rich and poor by money?</p>
<p>I am afraid, I am worried, will China's education go bankrupt? I also wonder how we will survive the days after the child is born? These two questions are swirling in my mind, and I can't find the answer.</p>
<p>The child is born, I am a father! Is this future responsibility a joy or a sorrow for me?</p>
<h3>Struggle</h3>
<p>— Hai Lin</p>
<p>The spring rain has been falling for days and continues.</p>
<p>A Long's dirty hand was digging at his sleepy eyes, letting the raindrops wash over his forehead, which he would never have the chance to wipe clean. But in his other hand, he held a basket of flatbreads and fried dough sticks, covered with a piece of faded oilcloth.</p>
<p>Dragging his shoes, he wandered among the rickshaw pullers: "Flatbreads and fried dough sticks, anyone?" The call reached the ears of every rickshaw puller. Especially his own, he heard it even more clearly.</p>
<p>It was noon, and his calls gradually grew quieter. He thought, "I must be hungry!"</p>
<p>Last night, after serving his master's wife at her late-night mahjong game, he had barely warmed the bed before his master dragged him up.</p>
<p>"Lazy ghost, go do business quickly, fifty of each, be careful when you come back if you don't sell them," he was pushed out the door just like that. He touched the flatbread, "It's cold, two days old."</p>
<p>How could he sell it? Rickshaw pullers would never spend money to buy day-old goods.</p>
<p>Thinking and thinking, he felt a bit dizzy. He walked to the corner of the wall and sat down.</p>
<p>"Go back and eat lunch? Don't even think about it."</p>
<p>"Then..." he looked at the basket.</p>
<p>The day-old goods now seemed so tender! He vaguely saw steam rising from them.</p>
<p>Goose-yellow fried dough sticks? Sesame-sprinkled flatbreads? Aromatic?</p>
<p>The fire in his stomach was burning.</p>
<p>A hand reached into the basket, but immediately retracted. His master's full face of flesh, those bulging fierce eyes, that giant demon palm, and his master's wife's mouth... all emerged in his thoughts like sea monsters.</p>
<p>He was desperate, he lowered his head... suddenly, he heard a commotion across the way... he focused his gaze:</p>
<p>Oh! It turned out to be street theatre, a woman was kicking a middle-aged beggar, the beggar had a piece of flatbread in his mouth... a piece of flatbread, his stomach grumbled. A lightning-fast hand reached into the basket.</p>
<p>Now he also had a piece of flatbread in his mouth.</p>
<h3>Root</h3>
<p>— Xin Bo</p>
<p>After passing this stone wall, the road followed the mountain's contour, gently trending northeast, with low hills on the right and shallow valleys on the left, still offering a sense of winding and turning. At the narrowest point, we had to separate, with A Wu walking ahead and Da Gen behind.</p>
<p>"I didn't even come to see you when you were sick last year," A Wu suddenly brought up this topic. "How did you get better? Are you fully recovered now?" He turned around to look.</p>
<p>What A Wu saw was a grinning face, stocky, ruddy, and very healthy. He also noticed a prominently protruding chest and a taller stature than his own.</p>
<p>Da Gen politely said a few words, then said, "It just got better on its own, didn't even take medicine. Now I seem to be even better than before, I'm hungry all day long; but I don't eat much. You look like you're enjoying a good life, not worrying about food."</p>
<p>"Enjoying a good life, my ass!" Da Gen's words rekindled A Wu's old grievances. After cursing the Huang Zong'an family for a while, he said: "I'm thinking of running away, not eating that bowl of prison food there anymore. But after I get out, what will I do? I don't know. Someone invited me to the 'team,' I haven't decided. Da Gen, what do you think?"</p>
<p>"I'm not used to that," Da Gen said, kicking a small stone on the road into the valley with his straw-sandaled foot, "but I don't think the Huang family is a bad place to live. Old Master Huang was willing to buy our fields, so we could pass the winter safely, and this year we can still have some capital for farming and working. We are very grateful to him."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay! Da Gen," with a heavy tone, "you are really too honest! He was going to buy the land anyway; he seized the opportunity to exploit you, don't you know? Huang Chong'an is a good person, even dogs don't eat shit! You mean there's not a single good person in his whole family!" (23)</p>
<h3>The Philosophy of Leisure</h3>
<p>— A Small Reader</p>
<p>People without a sense of career most readily place their time on the word "leisure." Leisure is the best friend of the general public, inseparable for a moment, leisurely during the day, even more leisurely at night. With so much "leisure," of course there is a need to "kill" it!</p>
<p>Our compatriots have the most "leisure" time. Whether old or young, male or female, they spend their lives immersed in the word "leisure," becoming more refined as they go. To this day, our methods of "killing" "leisure" also follow the rapid progress of the wheels of the times. Even the Western devils who hold the great banner of modern civilization sigh in admiration.</p>
<p>"Waiter! Two liang of baijiu, two pieces of dried tofu, some peanuts..." The wine is delivered, legs crossed, the bearded one strokes his beard, spending two or three hours, the cost of two or three hours is only two liang of baijiu... some peanuts... cheap.</p>
<p>Teahouses are the birthplace of leisure culture, and also a great collection of leisure for the general public. A Mao from the Li family ran away with a man, and after two or three hours, even a three-year-old child knows. Naturally, the tea server must collect materials every day to provide leisure topics for the patrons, oh! The collection of leisure, how admirable!</p>
<p>"Ping pong ping pong..." is the sound of mahjong tiles, the leisure of the elderly, young people, ladies and misses of our upper and lower classes;</p>
<p>"This miss is beautiful!"</p>
<p>"Chickens!" is the form of a male dog chasing a female dog, the leisure of degenerate youth, more active in the spring, and more common in the park. Theaters, cinemas, tea rooms, brothels, dance halls, cafes are the venues for people's leisure, day and night, millions upon millions of dark heads, moving like ants, studying the methods of leisure, spending their days in leisure.</p>
<p>Life is leisurely (?). Children crawl on the ground playing marbles, adults talk about romance, appreciate legs... leisure, killing leisure is the purpose of life, killing leisure is the philosophy of life.</p>
<h3>Willpower</h3>
<p>— Chun Sheng</p>
<p>According to psychological judgment, a strong will has three essential conditions: energy, perseverance, and direction.</p>
<p>It is said that the process of will is the same as the process of emotion. Expressing it in words is not very meaningful, because words are only suitable for representing thoughts. The essence of will lies in the ability to "act" and "persist."</p>
<p>Willpower is often hazy. Because will cannot represent the entire personality, another type of impulsive emotion immediately replaces it as the driving force. When emotion and will come to a choice, they prompt people to adopt a rational rather than blindly obedient attitude to execute a conscious decision. Theory is like this, and practical requirements are also like this.</p>
<p>Will must be closely linked to self-confidence, and the difficulty of self-confidence lies in not stubbornly clinging to one's own views within the scope of stubbornness.</p>
<p>People have willpower, but most cannot achieve perfection. Even if we divide energy, perseverance, and direction into three parts for testing, at most, I can only get thirty points, or even have to take a discount in the eyes of others.</p>
<h3>Midnight Jottings</h3>
<p>— Meng</p>
<p>(1) Poverty</p>
<p>The image of the Holy Son revealed a gentle smile, night! Spreading. I was immersed in a dark atmosphere, the sound of the watchman's clapper on the street, like the sad wail of a Hu jia, this dark night! Endless. How long have I been at peace? The tide of sorrow is flourishing in my mind.</p>
<p>"Poor kid!" Then suddenly a mud pellet broke through the air and drew near.</p>
<p>Emotions are in chaos, a chest full of blood, the bomb hidden in the bottom of my heart exploded, bang, my fist hit the table, I touched, pain, awakening, it turned out this is night, endure it. But, ah! This long night, when...?</p>
<p>(2) Hatred</p>
<p>Grandmother! You scold me, beat me. I hate, I resent, but this hatred seems to pass like a haze, disappearing. Yes, Grandmother, at the moment you hit me and scolded me, Grandmother's heart was even more difficult than answering!</p>
<p>I cry, tears filled my chest. I pray silently.</p>
<p>The high pressure of the environment makes you unable to breathe. All around are dry and astringent encounters, naturally, "emotions are stifled within, and expressed outwardly." I am useless, unable to share this burden for you, bitter wine and bitter cup, who will share the taste with you?</p>
<p>I should be beaten and scolded by you, beat me! Scold me! To slightly kill the pain in your heart.</p>
