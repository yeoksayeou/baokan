<p>社評</p>
<h3>談歐局</h3>
<p>目前世界戰爭的重心，在東方爲太平洋上的作戰，而在西方則為歐洲，特別是蘇聨戰場。紅軍的冬季反攻，除了表現在史太林格勒的解因以外，進而有高加索，庫爾斯克，與羅期托夫德軍之撤退。我們雖非軍事專家，不能作正確的　評，但是從本月十八日德國宣傳部長郭培爾氏的演說詞來看，歐局之嚴重性，是不能否認的了。郭培爾氏指出：「史太林格勒之戰，實已爲德國人民最大之警吿，此次冬季戰爭之敎訓，當已震醒歐洲人民之迷夢，布爾雪維克之執政者，以其嚴密之手段，掩飾其國情，致開戰之初，吾人對其作戰潛力，未能作正確之估計，時至今日，其作戰力量之龐大，乃透露於外，故吾人今非以全國之力量與之周旋不可。」他又特別鄭重指出以下幾點：即「（一）倘德軍未能征服此項危機，則德國與歐洲將先後受布爾雪維克主義之蹂躪；（二）但德今與友邦並肩作戰，確有為歐洲挽回此危局之力量；（三）今危機已迫，故吾人須認淸現實，以有效方法對付之。」推揣他的演說，厥在喚醒德國人民速勝的迷夢，促進德國的更加努力；而更僥有意味的，是在於喚醒中立各國及英美等反軸心國的人民，使能認淸現實，轉向德國反布爾雪維克的戰綫上來。所以郭培爾沉痛地的指出：一倘世間兵力最强的德國尙不能征服此赤禍，則世間再有何國能負此艱鉅？歐洲目前中立國均無稍事抵抗之力量，蘇聯之機械化部隊能在數日之內，至各國蹂躪。倘歐洲眞客於蘇聯之手中，則英美亦無能爲力矣。且屆時倫敦不能保其止於歐洲而不再渡越海峽。」很顯然的，這是在喚醒歐洲中立國與英美諸國，若因此等語句而遽然誤認德國在對蘇作戰中業已遭遇致命的打擊，歐洲戰爭立刻將發生驚人的變化，當然是極大的錯誤。我們今日一方面要認淸現實，認淸紅軍冬季反攻業已造成歐戰的新局勢。這種局勢將迫使歐洲中立各國決定自己的道路，而也逼迫英美重新烤慮其今後的行動。至於軸心各國當前的任務，是更緊密的合作，集中所可動員起來的一切力量，準備春夏來臨時期的決戰。而另一方面，我們還須估計到，在反軸心國方面的實際情形：第一，是英美和蘇聯之間的軍事合作，將發展到什麽程度？英美能不能信任蘇聯止於德國疆界之前而繼續協力？英美是否有力量乘冬季戰爭所造成的新局面，進而在東南歐地中海及西方開關所謂第二戰綫？以及中立各國會不會鑒於新局勢而作斷然的新決定？這些問題都是决定今後戰局的問題，只有從這些問題的硏究中，再加上對德國與蘇聯可能動員的新力量的正確估計，才能更正確地把握歐洲戰局的前途。</p>
<p>德國當局並不諱言冬季作戰中的逆勢，及業已「透露於外」的「蘇聯龐大的作戰力量」，然而，德方顯然並沒有氣餒，誠如郭培爾氏在其十八日的演說中所說：「今日之德國，人人均不作妥協之想，全國人民均已抱定堅苦作戰之意志。……誓必加以撲滅，決不中途屈服，此乃國社主義所應盡之義務。今戰事已發展至最髙峯，德國決不動搖鬥志，必以勝利結束此次戰爭。」而德國取勝的途徑，是在德國民衆之加緊努力。這一點，充分表現在郭培爾氏演說時向人民所提出的問題：「諸位深信必獲得最後勝利乎？決心赴湯蹈火，追隨元首乎？元首如要求每日工作十四至十六小時，願意服從乎？對元首之信仰較往日愈爲堅決乎？贊成取締偷閒取巧之徒乎？」這些問題的正面的肯定的答復，對於德國最後勝利具有決定的意義。所以他要求其國民：「僅應以戰爭爲念，不應思及其他。……全面動員之際，一切奢侈設備，均當予以停閉。」然誠如他所言：「今日之危機，非德國一國所受，全歐洲均身受之」，所以他又不能不要求德國及德國支配下歐洲的資源，必須澈底予以開發。同時「德國人民以血肉之軀，爲保障歐洲而犧牲，歐洲自亦應以勞力爲交換。吾人使用之方法，無庸論其優劣，而應論其是否成功。」</p>
<p>不過，我們談論歐洲戰局，還有一點絕對不能忽視的，是由於現代世界戰爭的國際性，歐洲的戰爭是與東亞的戰爭息息相關的。估計歐洲戰局的前途，必須同時估計東亞戰塲上這種形勢的存在，使英美龐大的戰鬥力，不能完全用在對歐洲的作戰上面。喊了一年多的歐洲第二戰綫，所以不能開闢，除了英美對蘇的猜疑心及不忠實之外，東亞戰爭對英美的慘重的打擊，實在是最重要的原因之一。在英美渝蘇所謂「四强會議」，正在加强其「反攻」的策動之際，日本在太平洋上的攻勢之確切保持，不能不說是德國最强大的一　。而日本今後進一步的動作，自然將是決定歐洲戰局的另一重要因素。這幾天日本各關係負責當局的表示，以及中國戰時政治，經濟，軍事各方面的政策之確立典推進，都可以看出東亞方面對於世界戰局發揮如何重大的力量。</p>

<h3>南太平洋戰果的驚異</h3>
<p>據日本大本營發表，日軍部隊在南太平洋進行新作戰的必要基礎，業已鞏固。此方面的戰爭，可以說業已進入新的階段。前階段戰爭的決算之一，在過去半載中帝國海軍部在此方面尙未發表的戰果，茲於十三日夕由大本營發表的，計　擊沉並損傷艦艇十六，擊墜飛機二三七，擊沉並損傷船舶一〇。在同期間，日本海軍部隊加於敵方勢力的損害，業已判明者計：擊沉戰艦六艘，損壞四艘，其他有艦艇六一二四艘，飛機一〇七四架，船舶三〇餘艘。在此，都證明了日軍的武威，如何値得　歎，英美雖自號「大國」，但從數字上可以推定的戰力的大消耗，其首腦者們見之將作何感想。</p>
<p>尤其在緒戰大敗後，倉皇失措的英美，對處理這種事態，出以極慘淡謹愼的手段，在國民面前，儘量隱瞞損害的眞相。但此後的損害，比緒戰中所受的打擊　見重大，今已無隱蔽的餘地。敵首腦者們最　恐懼者，即爲現實的暴露。因此，他們製造空虛的言論，以期振作國民的精神，但偽　的　寳往往附有　綻。羅斯福會說：「我們從此島攻至彼島，打破日本」：海軍部長諾克斯也說：「我們把太平洋的島嶼，一個個相繼奪回，並不想打到東京一，兩者都在發夢囈。敵人無論用何種方法，我們都不恐懼，假　從南太平洋方面米，他們在前階段所受的痛擊，必將再見於次階段的戰役中哩！（翔：譯自二月十五日東京日新聞）</p>

<p>香港在東亞共榮　圈所居地位、極爲重要、目被認爲束亞共樂圈之集散港、總督部爲予香港船舶公司以便利、乃以所屬倉庫一部借予在港之八船舶公司、以爲碼獨裝卸貨物之用、該八公司已於本月十八已成立裝卸倉庫營團、以期發揮集散港之機能、又香港貿易之重要部門乃爲將南方所產之原料加工製造後冉輪出、如根據去年十月與菲島成立之貿易協定、即曾大量輸入砂糖、烟葉、馬尼刺麻等、經當地工廠加工製造後、復輸往南方、故賴產業各界之努力、香港與南洋以及中國等地之貿易範圍、已益形擴大、最近並與南方以及大陸各地決定貿易清算方法、即（甲）與昭南菲島問之貿易、以特別方法淸算、（乙）與華北及滿洲間之貿易、在東京淸算、（內）與華中間之貿易、以軍票淸算、此決算方法決定後、香港與各地之貿易將愈益穩定圓滑</p>
<p>（二）造船</p>
<p>海運　香港造船廠之設備乃共榮圈之最優秀者　日軍佔領後立即着手恢復、關於船舶之建造與修理進行極爲順利、木造機帆船之建造成績尤佳、爲增强香港運輸能力、此種木造機帆船現已使用於香港與南方間之物資運輸、且已利用帆船木造船以爲當地運輸之一大補助、此種帆船所有人現已組成帆船運輸公會、專任沿岸輸送、現在香港佔領地所轄島嶼已與珠江河口之江門太平洋門以及汕頭廣州灣等地開始帆船之定期航行、</p>
<p>（三）工業</p>
<p>香港之重要工業爲冷凍、捲烟·酸紫·顏料·製釘·飲料·啤酒·製糖·洋灰·鹽酸等、現均於總督部之管理下、開始復業、總督部並已決定不久即將此等工廠　歸私人管理、華人經營之小工廠經許可復業者、已有七百餘家、大部份爲製造紡織品、食料品及雜貨、不久即將開始營業、總督部爲助長華人住民繁榮、決盡可能予以便利、</p>
<p>（四）金融</p>
<p>總督部于去年七月曾公布香港佔領地之通貨及兌換規程、用意即在限制敵性之港幣及强化軍票之行使、至今年二月軍票兌換所已將港幣之兌換限制自二百元擴大至一千元、以期軍票流通圓滑、總督部又鑒于依靠港幣生活者之衆多、已明示今後決維持現在之　　、香港有中國銀行二十家、亦均已復業、總督部現正努力使華商經營之銀行儘速恢復正常狀態、日將於二月底或三月初撤廢提存限制、</p>
<p>（五）人口</p>
<p>問　、總督部現極力慫恿華人住民歸鄕、並予以乘船之便利、現約有九十萬人已自香港疏散、且最近與廣東當局協商結果、自三月起更將實行有效之促進方法、然此項歸鄉並非僅爲整理人口、同時亦係根據香港廣東重行合理分配之見地而實行者、歸鄉人士決儘可能使其安居樂業、此於華南之農業生產亦大有裨益、</p>

<h3>渝「平價購銷處」的內容　日用品供應站空空如也</h3>
<p>— 金彥</p>
<p>重慶政權爲了緩和人民心理，在「經濟部」之下，設立平價購銷處，以供應日用品爲號召。可是，事實上南轅北轍。購銷無貨，有價不平，且看下面一個重　市民江靖生向輿諭界呼籲的一封信：</p>
<p>「在物價髙漲聲中，政府能爲市民利益着想，創辦了「平價購銷處，」在重慶市區分設了許多日用品供應站，並擴充到市郊，　建區，雖窮鄉僻壤，也都有分店出現。經售物品，花色很多。他們所有的門市部，終日　。有幾個月事，市民確乎沾着相當的實惠。可是一年以來，他們的生意却每况愈下，存貨日少。起初除了幾樣特殊的貨品（如絨綫牙膏之類），是眞正因爲粥少僧多不及分配的緣故，規定了時間和種種的手續加以限制，原是不得已的辦法，嚴格的說，在「日用品」，「日用必須品」，尤其是「供應站」，是不容許有這怪現象的！旣是號稱「日用必須品」的，就該充分採購，不使短缺。不然還配呌什麽「必需品」，還成什麽「供應站」？簡直是「供檢站」了！可是他們的存貨，竟不想法多多購進，漸漸的率性一律都採用「搶購」的辦法。到了現在，連最普通的肥皂，火柴，也都是用這樣的辦法在出賣。經常每天只有下　一時左右，標購一兩樣貨品，使得附近的市民，用盡平生之力，去搶賣了一包火柴，或一塊肥皂，和一盒香烟，或一條毛巾。平時他們的貨櫉裏，空無所有，一天僅僅忙不了半小時，其餘的時間，男女店員都在擺龍門陣，吃茶，看報……照理平價購銷處果眞要照計劃做的話，掛起爲民衆謀福利的牌子去辦貨，我想一定沒有因難，店中經常的存貨，雖不能說比商店豐滿，但至少總不至反比商店短缺，更不致使全店空虛，店員空坐着無貨可售，無事可做。可是事實擺在面前，他們旣不在「供」，也不在「應」。早已失掉「供應」兩字的意義了。星期日我從陜西街到上淸寺，走遍了全市，每個供應站，我曾特別留心去看過，都是一樣的「空空如也」。店員談天「侃侃如也」。我於是本能的想道，「這樣的供應站，到不如收縮了罷！」「再開下去我們人民太不　當了！」請估算一下，城鄉一共要有幾十站，每日開銷如此之大，養着這多閒人，終日無所事事，這是多麼浪費的事啊！最近福生莊也開了好多門市部，生意之好已正與日用品公賣處當初開辦時的情形相同。據說他們是同隸於經濟部的物資局，他們原是一家，而供應站正是淸閒得無以爲供。何不委託代辦呢？又是什麽理山需要獨立門戶，好多支一份開辦費和經常費呢？我眞不懂，這算不算十足浪費！財政困靴到這步田地，還容許有這樣浪費的事嗎？我眞有些骨　在喉，不吐不快。如果不能經常供應貨物，爽快的請他們歸併或收縮了罷！日後如有零星物品，要佈施給市民的話，可用巡邏隊出動市郊，隨時兜售。或效法鄕間趕集的辦法，也未始不可！何必這樣的開玩笑。沒有幾件「實貨」放着，還說是供應站呢？」（三十一年十二月廿八日寄）</p>

<h3>各方評論　郭培爾演說</h3>
<p>柏林二十日海通社電　德國政治報吿稱、宣傳部長郭培爾博士、向德國人民提出之十項問題、爲德國在此困難時期所應對付者、過去數星期德人所獲得之消息、爲多年來最嚴重者、每一人均表示關心、任何人均不能冉袖手旁觀、郭氏坦白承認德國對蘇聯估計過低、中國俗語云、知己知彼、百戰百勝、　哉是言、今日德人不再對蘇聯作非份想矣、無論何人、欲在蘇聯氣候中擊敗蘇聯、除習於該國之氣候外、毫無他術、德國之錯誤、在乎進行殲滅蘇聯之時、同時墨守中歐之生活、德國今卽　此教訓、則決能一洗新近之恥辱、毫無疑問、</p>

<h3>實踐戰時生活　家庭節約電力</h3>
<p>在戰時節約物資的大的提下，盡量減少不必要的物資之消耗，屢經當局　　，無需贅述，電力的節約，亦爲國民今後所應　行的物資節約中，最切要的一種。在不需要的時候，當然不必開電燈，即在必要的時候，也應該聚集於最少限度的電燈數下工作，　可能的减少電燈使用數。</p>
<p>三〇瓦特的燈泡，每天使用五小時，假使節减一盞，則一個月可以節電四·五基羅瓦特，爲數雖微，但累積起來，數目即其可觀。每個國民應加注意而力行。（翔：譯自二月四十日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>美國社會動盪面　工資問題僵化</h3>
<p>（沮利希特電十三日　由特派員發）美國政府努力從事固定戰事期間之生活費，但其所籌措之額外戰費，今正影響及於美國經濟生活之各部門，而感受重大威脅。美國政府與勞慟組合之協調，日見困難，據華盛頓美聯社電，二大勞働組合之指導者，美國勞工總同盟會長格林，及各產業組織會議長麥萊，爲生活費不絕增髙，而向羅斯福抗議，顯見勞働大衆不滿情　之髙漲。事實上，最近美國各種勞働團體頻頻發出增加工資之要求，戰時勞働局增加鐵工業工資所作之規定，超過一九四一年之工資水凖百分之十五，但經濟調整局長官巴恩斯，向戰時勞働局質問，此規定是否有加以修正之必要？</p>
<p>美國礦山勞働者之工資，雖經勞働局確定而爲最髙額，但鑛山勞働組合仍要求四十五萬炭坑夫的工資每日須增加二元，坑夫組合以原則不適爲由，故工資增加之原則，至少有增髙百分之十五之必要。工資增加業已達最髙額之支加哥四大罐頭工塲工人六萬四千名，亦要求每小時工資追加百分之五。戰時勞働局若承認此工資增加額，則不啻放棄上述百分之十五之政策。罐頭工人之工資若增加，則食品價格不能不随之上漲，對全般物價政策，生活費政策，均有危險。格林　百分之十五政策過於呆定，因物價之不絕上漲，並不適當，因此，格林以爲生活費若不能予以固定，則工資自亦不能固定。勞工部長派金斯曾指出農業生產品價格爲生活費貴之原因。</p>
<p>所以，在美國，工資爭議與通貨膨脹之危機，同爲無可避免之事實，而成爲苦悶之種子。（翔：譯自二月十五日東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>日在華文化工作　醫療·教育·設施一斑</h3>
<p>（東京電話）岡部長景子於十八日貴挨院預算總會質問稱：「爲建設大東亞共榮圈，於文化工作上有何決定？對於文化等施策，願聲其詳。）東條首相對此答稱：於政治，經濟，文化各部門，今正實施各項施東，披瀝今後期於萬全之明確方針。關於對華文化工作，靑木大東亞相稱：「今正在中國實施醫療。普及日本語等施策」。日本政府對華文化工作之途徑，於此可見一斑。其具體施策及計劃大致如此：</p>
<p>文化工作關係之總預算，連前已決定之預算一千八百萬團在內，合計遠二千八百萬圓，其中關於醫療防疫者約占九百萬圓。於此可見政府對於醫療方面之注意，防疫對策之主要者，於華中十二地區，業已設立防疫委員會，繼續推進，去年秋，　州虎疫猖獗，但由該委“會盡力阻遏，茲於杭州，蘇州，南京，蕪湖四大防疫處外：更於上海新設華中防疫處，使其內容與外觀同爲世界第一，近正在計劃之中。此等防疫設施，均將於大規模之同仁會整個組織下次第實現。同仁會更設診療所於上海，杭州，南昌，廬山，九江，漢口，蕪湖，無錫，蘇州，金華等地方，設立醫院，積極服務，嘉惠平民。</p>
<p>日本語之普及，今已越過宜撫指導之階段，於中日同生共死之新面目下，全中國現已充滿熱烈研習之新景象，今後於華中設立日本語學校之方針，將爲（一）設立模範的日本語學校、（二）平均設置日語學校於各地區，亟盼其早日實現。</p>
<p>政府並於東亞同文書院自四月起新設專門部，開設華北髙等工業學校於北京，以爲敎育機關之實質上的整備，而與普及日本語同時並進，此外，同仁會新設之上海醫科大學　亦漸具體化，去秋並將雷士德工業學校改稱爲東亞髙等學校，由同文書院經營，對於工業敎育貢獻必多。（翔：譯自二月十九日大陸新報夕刋）</p>

<p>（二）在某種情事中、由本局自行訂定最高零售價目、本局刊發以上兩項布告、係根據地產章程新附則第五十三款之規定、該附則授權本局、得隨時公布應受物價統制之物品項目、但截至年底爲止、本局因循日本當道之請求、統制物價僅限於零售物品耳、批發價目迄未統言、惟有數起、經製造商批發商及其他關係方面合作後、訂定棉布呢絨罐裝食品、皮件等等之售價、</p>
<p>計算成本課工作至爲繁劇、除訂定麵包大餅及其他麪製品之售價外、復經陸續評定大百貨公司所售一般市民日常生活用品約六千種之多、此外有他類商店出售之日常用品一千餘種、其售價亦經訂定、他如訂立肉類與鮮牛奶以及匹頭呢絨之限價、種類亦多、截至年底爲止、經該課核訂限價之物品、總數達一〇·七八六種、</p>
<p>本局所設實施統制物價工作之兩課、一爲訂算成本課、已如上述、另一課即爲調查及執行限價課、查一九四一年十一月十八日暨二十四日及十二月四日本局曾刋發佈告三項、規定進口貨物之零售限價、其時爲實施此項限價起見、曾在工業社會處設置執行限價辦事處、歸由執行限價委員會監督、嗣因本局統制物價事務日見增重、爰將執行限價辦事處之範圍予以擴充、並於上年四月間、將該處移隸統制物價辦事處、改稱調查及執行限價課、洎乎年底、一切零售物價幾已全受統制、執行限價課之工作突見繁重、復將該課分爲兩部份、一爲調查辦事處、一爲執行限價辦事處、俾專責成、</p>

<h3>抑平物價的幾點希望</h3>
<p>— 毓岐</p>
<p>廢歷年關以來，物價直綫狂漲，使薪水階級感到莫大的威脅，此種情形自不能放任，爰向當局發抒幾點希望。</p>
<p>（一）實行「清市運動」，物價暴漲的藉口是來源阻斷，存底日竭，於是求過於供，不得不漲。但據各報載：開關以來，各物供應已趨正常，至存底亦蜀豐厚，短時間决無匱乏之處。　顯然物價的飛漲，咸由投機，所謂黑市買賣所致；有黑存買賣，當然有實在的貨物。否則，寗有如許的市儈們來做那種空無所有的買賣。然而表而上都裝模作樣，佯言百物斷擋，促使上漲則更顯見的，幷不是眞正的來源不暢，實際上還是由於奸商的囤積，市儈的居奇而已。</p>
<p>所以我希望當局能立即實行「淸市運動」。强迫打開倉庫，嚴厲搜查堆棧，嚴格淸查商店，即住宅亦在檢查之　。，則一般囤戶，便將無所遁形。一旦查到登記的私貨，立予充公，執行平賣，因爲「羊毛出在羊身」上，苟處以罰金，則一般不良商人，事後百社設法漲價，間接無異處罰於平民頭上也。而近來囤積居奇抬價牟利之徒，視罰金爲無足輕重，亦由此故。</p>
<p>（二）竭力疏通來源，一方面實行「淸市運動」，亦即所謂治標工作，使囤貨盡行出籠；又一方面若更着力於治本工作的疏通來源，當尤能收事半功倍之效。因爲一旦而達供過於求的飽和點，退而能至求供相抵的對等地位；則奸商旣不能施用其「來源短少」的藉口，而漲價之舉，自也不能堅持，則物價之下降，亦可如水銀瀉地，與漲價成比例。</p>
<p>（三）嚴厲執行限價，租界當局的經濟警察，聞已訓練完成。希望　後對於所頒布的新限價的執行。能趨於絕對嚴厲。一旦發現舞弊營私等情，嚴究不貸，以儆傚尤。庶乎民生可能漸趨安定。</p>
<p>（四）强制實行平賣，舉凡曾向租界當局登記過的各項貨物，當局宜揮其普遍而且實用者，抽出總數中百分之九十，來加以强制性平售：像昔日實行大平賣時一般，以救燃眉之急。然後再徐圖改進。</p>
<p>以上四點，以第一點尤爲重要，此舉不但可淸查戶口，幷得以安定民生，誠一舉而兩得。</p>
<h3>法租界戶口證　須懸明顯處　以便隨時抽查</h3>
<p>法租界警務當局對界內居民之戶口調查業已完竣、身份居住證亦已完全發竣、現更爲防脊小之徒、匿跡界內、爲確切維持地方治安起見、各區時派警務人員、按保甲抽查戶口、故特規令各戶長須將戶口證懸掛於明顯之處、以便隨時抽查、否則須照章處罰、</p>

<p>本市各業同業公會、前曾因環境變異、一時無人主持、對於商業發展、頗多障礙、迨經社運當局分別整飭、機構始漸擴展、降及市商曾經整理後恢復、而工部局復相繼設立公會課、情形遂大爲改觀、會務組織亦加擴大、同時廣徵同業入會、據上海社記者探悉、截至最近、經社運當局正式核准並向工部局公會課登記之同業公會、的三百餘單位、登記之公會在機構上遂顯有統一之傾向、</p>
<p>四十單位已經解散</p>
<p>查全滬同業公會、原計三百六十八單位、其中僅一百四十九家經向當局登記、目下公會組織已遭解散者約四十單位、即汽油業·汽車業·卡車業·輪船業·航業·煤炭運輸業·無綫電廣告業·油燈業·軍服業·代客贖當業·及傭人介紹業等、故實際所賸公會不過三百二十餘家、今因當局統制關係、幾已全數向主管當局登記核准成立、以使協助當局執行經濟政策、</p>
<p>協助限價分配物資</p>
<p>至於工部局所設之公會課、自成立以來、工作范圍日益擴充、該課最初成立動機、在於聯絡本市各業公會、協力統制物價及分配物資、除儘力溝通當局與各業間之關係外、如各業本身發生困難時、將接受各該業公會之善意申請、予以審核、並進一步指導各業之活動、俾官商尋求解決之途徑、以言物價統制、該課將在顧全商業及民生兩者之原則下、覓取一合理之物價水準、步驟上先調整物品製造成本、然後漸經批發而統制另售價格、</p>

<p>公共租界第二週禁止隨時吐痰運動、為期業已一週、在此一週期內、第十處賴警務當局之幫助）、對於宣傳工作得以順和進行、並有以切實執行原定違者罰款五元之命令、是以衛生處當局對於警方之協助、甚表感謝、一般民衆以當局誠懇之勸告、以及廣大之宣傳、對於隨地吐痰之提審、多已能深切瞭解、且能各自警惕、實行改革頑習、</p>
<p>皺起罰款移充衛生工作用途</p>
<p>但星期四級處罰款之居民爲此亦並不在乎、對於此項罰款、據云將充足進行公共衛生工作之用途、並悉隨地吐痰之禁令、將長期執行、每次罰洋五元之規定、亦將繼續有效、故當局深望居民各自注意、以免遭受無謂損失、同時並聞衛生處於今後更擬擴大之公共衛生宣傳之範圍、務期上海每一居民均能顧全大衆之健康、以使上海成爲一世界著名之淸潔區云、</p>

<h3>房租調解委員會一年間總報告　處理問題一百三十四件　每種糾紛務使雙方同意</h3>
<p>工部局爲處理因住屋缺乏，及因通貨價値之低落而生之房租問題，於前年十二月創設房租調解委員會，與法務局聯絡從事解决房東與房客間之糾紛，迄去年末止該委員會所處理之問題達百三十四件，其內容計：</p>
<p>房客提出者六十六件，房東提出者六十八件，委員會前後曾開會議百一十四次，用愼重態度加以調停，該委員會去年度受理之調停狀况，由於雙方讓步而解決者四十四件，委員會裁決者十七件，不任管轄範圍內而退還者三十件，駁回者二十四件，提出訴訟者十六件，現在審理中者三件，共計百三十四件。</p>
<p>工部局房租調停委員會關於調停租金貸借規則發表談話如次：</p>
<p>（一）添减房租運動起於民國二十三年，至二十六年時租金漸見上騰，自前實施之房租估價，尙係以二十六年爲基礎，住宅部分，據調查因捐稅負担上之不公平，經特別委員會決增加百分之二十。</p>
<p>（一）當時此項措置，會有人以爲在估價上不甚公平，且在事變前即二十六年房租即已因種種原因而有不公平狀態，因此，工部局在一定基礎下從事土地，建築物之新估價，此舉並不適用於課稅的目的，在三十一年八月間之實際情形上，從住屋之相對的租賃價格觀點上亦可以見之。</p>
<p>（一）此次估價應不較原來估價為高，可稱公平，調停委員會當決定爲調整房租基礎之房租額時，曾考慮將同地區同型住屋加以比較，每種糾紛，就其實情予以調停，務使在變方同意後始予解決。</p>
<h3>南洋各地特輯之三　菲律賓的今昔（三）</h3>
<p>— 選民</p>
<p>運輸船隻的不足，美菲貿易不暢，最受深刻影響的是和平產業，尤其是佔菲島輸出之大宗糖業。即一九四一年對美砂糖輸出定量九十五萬噸，內有十萬噸就因爲船位不足而堆積，使菲島糖業痛受打擊。然實際上不止爲糖業，例如鐵鑛和木材事業，一向以對日輸出爲貿易中心，這時爲了杜絕對日輸出而使鑛山停閉，木業停頓，並且平添廣大的失業羣衆。在一九四一年十一月，菲島失業者，達到四十萬之數。（按世界恐慌時—一九三二年全菲失業人數農業營業者二十六萬五千六百零九人，工業勞動者二十一萬三千四百五十四人，共計四十七萬九千零六十三人。）</p>
<p>對美貿易一有變化，菲島經濟立受影響，理清最近幾年來美菲貿易即可明瞭。這里充分指出菲島對美的依存關係，這種關係的變化，無異爲菲島制命的打擊：</p>
<p>菲律賓對美貿易額（單位千比索）</p>
<p>從美菲貿易的這種實情，可知一日斷絕以後的結果之險惡了，尤其是菲島的主要產品砂糖椰子亁，椰子油，烟草，麻等，大部份都爲對美輸出而生活，絕不能希望消化於國內市塲，貿易難絕後，生產過剩及滯貨現象，就會造成經濟恐慌。另一方面消費物資及其他輸人的斷絕，跟着一部份商品的缺乏，必然地出現？物價暴漲的現象。美國輸入菲島的主要物資爲肉及酪乳製品，紙烟，棉製品，汽車，汽油，鋼鐵製品，鑛山用機械，電氣器具等，此外更重要的是食品。菲島米產約一千四百萬石，此外爲玉蜀黍亦有相當產量，然而不足供給一千六百萬人口的需要，每年必須從美國及越南等地輸入大量米麥，此外果實菜蔬類每年輸入達七百萬比索，魚類加工品四百萬比索，小麥粉一千萬比索，肉類加工品三百萬比索，咖啡及可可三百五十萬比索，合計輸入食品達二千七百五十萬比索。這些食品，原有一部份由歐洲，日本及澳洲輸入，已　歐戰，對日封鎖及船舶不足間斷絕，不得不全靠美國供給。汽車等物資的斷絕，受打擊者不過菲島二，三萬富裕階級，可是食糧問題的打擊，却是一千五百多萬菲人所痛切感受到的。現在美國勢力已經從菲律賓完全撤退了，留下的巨大的空隙，急待東亞民族自己來塡補！</p>
<p>戰前菲律賓的經濟機構</p>
<p>菲律賓的經濟幾構在美帝國七義資本有計劃的經略之下，呈現近代殖民地經濟的特色，成爲美國投資商品的獨立市塲，同時，是美國所需原料與勞動力的源泉之一。經濟結構充分表現其對美的依存性。所以，雖然一向誇爲南洋歐美殖民地中最文明國自負而預期於一九四六年七月獨立建設共和聯邦的菲律賓，不問政治上如何，經濟的殖民地性之不易擺脫是非常明顯的。因此，曾經以國立興發公司爲中心，設立國策公司，推行國民經過保障運動，以圖實現工業化，在商業方面推行零售業自主化運動，並設地方開發局，以推行建設現代化的農村運動，所有這些菲島經濟自主化合理化運動，自然不是短時期內所能達到的，而戰爭又使這一切計劃和事業都葬送了。</p>
<p>菲島經濟的不健全，是美帝國主義對菲政策的結果。美國雖爲東亞門戶開放機會均等主義的倡導者，但是對其殖民地菲島的事實，恰採行相反的門戶閉鎖機會不均等主義，貿易，幣制，投資金等，完全實行壟斷。這就是菲島經濟不均衛發展—對經濟環境轉變所有耐久力的薄弱性的最大原因。這不只是理論，而有下面許多具體事實作證：</p>
<p>（一）菲島經濟以農業爲主幹菲律賓經濟的生命綫專對美輸出貿易。這種輸出貿易，主要和最大量的是砂糖等等的農產品，因此其基本產業便不能不是農業了。</p>
<p>美國對菲島的影響，雖然在政治和文化方面表現其極其近代化的，但是重工業和化學工業等近代產業完全缺如，而使其經濟呈現殖民地經濟的特色。農產方面，依據林產，水產，礦產等原始產業輸出原料及半製品，而美國對菲則供給完全製品及一部分半製品。而輸出經濟中最主要的是砂糖，椰子，麻，烟草等農產。</p>
<p>（二）農產輸出商品化。由於上述特徴，菲律賓農業的規模及其輸出商品地之狀况，可從下表中看出：（一九四〇年數字）</p>
<p>由上表可見除米及玉蜀黍等二，三種以外的重要農產，完全是輸出商品。例如甘蔗的收穫價額爲一億一千三百萬比索，以此作爲砂糖而輸出的價額爲一億比索，可知國內銷路極小。椰子，烟草，馬尼拉麻等，也有同樣的傾向。一方面，主要食糧如米，收穫量不足內需，而每年都仰給於國外輸入。但在一八九七年美西戰爭時，一向是菲島重要的輸出品之一；入美國統治，就轉變為輸入品，一九一二年輸人額爲二千六百萬比索，至一九三九年達八億三千六百萬噸！米及小麥粉等食料輸入額在全輸入中占百分之二十，呈現農業國食糧不能自給的矛盾現象。</p>
<p>（三）美國對菲貿易通貨政策的影響，砂糖，椰子，烟草，麻等產業，在美國佔領菲島以前，即在西班牙統治之下時，已是繁榮的產業。美帝國主義對菲政策，更進一步對此種製品實行關稅特惠（自一九一三年起完全免稅）大量購入，同時對菲推銷高價的美國商品。結果在種植此種作物，銷於美國，菲可獲利甚厚，無形中鼓動種植；反之，其他作物，以無利可獲或獲利甚少而漸至無人一顧，一方面，砂糖，椰子，麻及烟草等對美輸出農業，雖與本國無甚關係，而呈畸形發展，一方面則人口逐年增加，而食糧產量，反日益减少。</p>
<p>（四）四大產業的比重　上述四大產業，在菲島經濟所佔地位如下：</p>
<p>（甲）砂糖業：菲糖在輸出品中占六〇％，栽培及生產投資額合計二億六千五百七十五萬美元（一美元合兩比索）菲島人民約有二百五十萬人的生活，即直接間接靠糖業維持。而菲島政府收入的大部分就是糖業的稅金。國有馬尼拉鐵路公司收入的四〇％是砂糖運費。</p>
<p>（乙）椰子產業：在輸出品中占一七％，資本額二億二千萬美元，約有四百萬島民直接依之爲生。</p>
<p>（丙）麻業：產品占輸出品之一三％，生產及改良費的投資額爲一億八千五百萬美元，約有二百五十萬人民的衣食仰給於此。</p>
<p>（丁）烟草業：占輸出貿易的四％，栽培用地及改良費投資額二千一百萬美元，依此爲生的島民約有五十萬人。</p>
<p>由此可知，有八百萬人，即全人口的半數以上，直接間接依靠着這叫種輸出產業爲生。這樣，美國就可以暢行其對菲支配政策了。可是在菲島本身，這種經濟的不均衡發展，實可謂民族的悲劇。</p>

<p>國府參戰後，中日合辦國策公司之任務，在於增加主要資源以後對國府財政上之援助。關於此項問題，中支那振興會社兒玉總裁及平澤副總裁，曾與各關係公司當局協商具體方案，擴充中支那振興會社以下隸屬公司之機構，加强其資金與人事連繫。按大東亞戰爭發生以前，國策公司之事業方針，在於致力復興戰事破壞之產業，但大東亞戰爭發生以後，其事業方針，不得不重新改革，尤以國府參戰以後，使國策公司之使命加重，財政上之貢獻國府，已爲絕對必需之條件，其對象爲以下三點；（一）對國府之股本，付與利息，（二）開征國策公司之稅款，（三）用增强生產方法間接援助國府。關於此事，已由各方加以檢討，聞其內容，大體如下：對國府股本之支付利息，各社正在進備中，其中已有數社支付淸訖。關於應付與國府之利息，各社因特殊關係成立，迄今尙未付出者，亦均完全結淸，作爲公積。合計十三會社之利息數額，相當龐大，此款一旦歸入國府，則國府之財政必然加强。由此觀之，國策公司對於國府之財政上貢獻實大（大陸新報）</p>

<h3>戰時經濟政策綱領實施重於原則</h3>
<p>最近全國經濟會議議決，本月十四日國府明令公佈之戰時經濟政策綱領，已刊載各報，早爲讀者所共悉。查其內容，簡括言之：（一）關於增加生產者，不外農業，鑛藏，軍需民需工業之開發，及農工生產者正當收益之保障：（二）關於調劑物價者，不外改善運輸配給，减少居間階級，取締投機居奇，及維持各種物價相互間之合理比率；（三）關於節約消費者，不外代用品之獎勵製造，奢侈品之限制生產，取締非必要之消費，及分施定額配給；（四）關於穩定幣値及調劑金融者，不外健全金融機構，獎勵人民儲蓄，推進產業放款，倡導資金內移，並根本使幣値之穩定與生產力之增進相配合；（五）關於改造經濟機構者，不外調整，改組，及聯合各產業部門之各個階段，並將健全及主要之產業，爲自治的統制，或團體的經營。細讀此，不特爲戰時經濟之要道，而立國之經濟政策，悉備於此矣。</p>
<p>一個國家一個政府之策略，常因其政治背景而左右，於是仁智互見，各以其眼光地位之不同，而異其見解與評判。今次之綱領，誠所謂提綱挈領，要言不煩，無一字一句談及政治，無論某黨也，某派也，南也，北也，東也，西也，恐莫不以此項政策爲中國切要之圖矣。</p>
<p>雖然，定原則易，立計劃難；爲大綱易，擬細目難，立計劃爲大綱尙易，而實施則更難。茲聞政府已令有關各部會，妥擬辦法，切實施行。可見此事之重要，不在空談，而在實施。至實施上之困難，恐尙不一而足。困難不打破，實現難成功。困難之能否打破，須視政府之是否努力，各方之有無誠意，並有賴於官民上下之合作，各業專家之設計。如是而後繼領方不至爲點綴之工具矣。</p>
<h3>工業原料漲價　急宜籌謀對策</h3>
<p>近日上海地區一般物價之昂騰，約二倍於舊歷新正以前。此種現象，即在各種工業原料方面，亦極顯著。例如鐵工原料之薄鐵板，亦顯示昂騰，舊歷新正以前，每噸爲三萬元，現在則達四萬五千元以上。諸如此類之情形，影響中國人之工塲方面，至深且巨，必須籌謀一急速之對策。（支那情報）</p>
<h3>重慶注意開發西北資源　因滇緬公路重開無望</h3>
<p>二月十八日同盟社廣州電稱：重慶政權現正積極從事於宣傳西北資源之開發，因此對滇緬公路，雖有英美之助，亦無重開之望。近悉重慶自一月十五日起之一星期，特定爲開發西北資源宣傳週，所有無綫電，新聞紙以及各種刊物，同時均作大規模的宣傳，喚醒人民認知開發西北天然資源之重要性。</p>
<h3>公債續高　一律出八十元</h3>
<p>公債行市，昨續上漲。各統一公債，均已穿出八十元大關。買戶多而賣戶少。收解時，賣戶交貨，頗見遲滯。丙種初做三元半，會小至二元三角，高至六元四角，最後爲六元二角。聞散集後，行市更高。其他四種，甲種做四元半。乙種做三元。丁種做零五角。戊種做二元半。丙種行市，已達八一三前之高價以上。</p>

<h3>華中通貨工作底發展（三）　軍票儲鈔併行流通的影響</h3>
<p>儲鈔具有統一華中華南幣制底使命，從民國二十九年正月出現以來，使華中幣制益形複雜化。這種儲備券跟軍票並駕齊驅地發展着，前年八月底，發行額竟達一萬萬元，資金凍結令頒佈後，其發行額跟上述軍票具有同樣理由而日益擴大，十一月底爲一萬萬六千萬元，十二月底爲三萬萬六千萬元，取消新售法幣等價後，去年三月底便接近五萬萬元，舊法幣全面收回工作告一段落時底九月，竟達十六萬萬元，而十一月則已經超過二十萬萬元了。當然這是一件極値得可喜可賀的事，但在此我們要研究的是目前這種軍票與儲鈔併行流通，對華中社曾經濟起着何種影響。</p>
<p>在理論上說，儲備券是南京國民政府底通貨，軍票是日本帝國在作戰上藉以購置必要物資與勞力而產生的貨幣，這一點，大概沒有人不同意，若單純以華中現狀爲前提，上述本來任務雖不會發生困難，但相互携手並進，代替舊法幣方面，軍票與儲鈔間則發生許多問題。在此我們檢討一下軍票與儲鈔二單位制度底經濟影響，首先我們需要認淸，因儲鈔必然引起軍票回流底現象。</p>
<p>第一，從基本方面來看，無論是對華中經濟工作底統一上，也無論是對中國人民底心理影響上，軍票與儲鈔二單位體都不是好的現象。現在日本帝國旣與國民政府化爲一體，不僅共同駢肩進行武力戰，且亦必須相輔相協從事經濟戰；在反抗舊法幣機構的同一經濟陣營內，兩種不同的通貨在割據着，且各行其是，那末所期望的效果還會達到麼？這一點反映在中國人民心理上，也可能對日本與中國精神上底統一與協力。給與不良影響，我們應當記得，在七七事變前後，蔣政權底幣制統一工作，對統一中國民心方面，進而對統一中國政治與經濟方面，曾起過如何顯著的作用；這就是我們希望盡可能使華中華南華北（不僅限於華中），普遍的領土上，產生代替舊法幣底統一幣制之理由。</p>
<p>第二，單從發展通貨工作底表面上看，儲鈔與軍票底併行流通，徒加强舊法幣底反攻力，反削弱二省對抗舊法幣底效能。在同一和平區內，存在着儲鈔與軍票二種各自擁有勢力範圍的貨幣，在力量與效能之不集中或分散上看，在客觀上，就是削弱通貨底戰鬭潛能</p>
<p>第三，從穩定商業靈活交易底立塲來看，二單位貨幣制也不是理想的目標。最后，軍票與儲鈔底兌換率，法定爲十八對一百，一般市塲上也無大出入，一般投機現象似乎業已絕跡。雖然前此階段，儲備券曾是極好的投機G——G）對象，而現在也不能說，在軍票和儲鈔裏找不到投機底餘地。何况其不能穩定商業，且阻撓商品交易與振興實業。投機這一點，我們暫且不談，而如考慮一下交易靈活方面，二單位貨幣制就需要兩種計算方法和兩種賬簿，徒增繁雜與混亂，而毫無益處。（季譯自一月二十七日東京經濟學者堀新一原著）</p>
<h3>「物價之敵」的掮客　當局決予淸除</h3>
<p>日華關係當局爲解決威脅民衆生活的物價問題，雖出以種種斷然措置，但因有一般在製造者與消費者之間，圖謀巨利之掮客的存在！遂乃促進物價顯著的勗騰。領事館警察署，工部局經濟警察，市政府社會局有鑒於此，決於密切聯絡之下從事淸除掮客。因當局認爲抑制物價政策而使物價漸趨上騰，要以掮客之存在爲其一因，聞將從事積極的取締云。（大陸新報）</p>
<h3>華股仍未復業　關係當局將予整理</h3>
<p>華股市塲，自暫停交易後，昨日仍未開市。聞有關當局，鑒於本市華股市塲及各股票公司之組織機構，過於混亂，故將予以整理。是以下星期一尙無復業消息。</p>
<p>又訊，主管當局對於一切有關今後經營華商股票上可供商確之點，將來此時機，加以詳密考慮，而後指示一種可供遵循之範圍。故預料此次股票市塲復業後，或許另有一番新面目矣。</p>
<h3>四行儲蓄會分派會員紅利</h3>
<p>四行儲蓄會，自民國三十一年七月一日起至同年十二月三十一日止，照章辦理第三十九期决算·計純益國幣十萬零零七百十九元八角三分。除提公積金·基本會員酬金·與職昌勞金·及公益金外，會員應得紅利國幣六萬三千四百五十三元四角九分，合週息一厘；連同保息七厘，共得週息八厘，與上期相同，又該會三十一年十二月底止，各項儲金總額爲二千二百五十三萬三千九百四十元零一角八分，內以活期儲金佔七百十萬零六千七百九十四元二角一分爲最多，次爲二年定期儲金，計五百十五萬八千五百零六元二角五分，又次爲滿期儲金，計三百零九萬一千零四十元零六角。</p>
<h3>當局採取斷然措施後　條金黑市恐將根絕</h3>
<p>據大通社記者自消息靈通方面接獲報告，金市暗盤之激騰，現已重行引起當局之密切注視。據聞當局對於投機商人之採縱金價，極表痛憤，刻正蒐集有關此輩活動之詳盡報告，以爲日後施行嚴厲慾處之根據。據關係方面指稱，當局之所以毅然採取此項斷然措置，固屬由於條金黑市之狂漲，足以刺激一般物價之高騰，然銀樓業之請求放寬飾金限價，實亦促成此舉之主要因素。蓋以銀樓業請求寬放限價所持之惟一理由，即爲有虧血本，而其所以虧本之原因，則即基於條余黑市狂漲。據大通社記者調查所知，條金市價曾由工部局當局，於本年一月八日予以限制，定爲二萬七千五百元，而飾金限價，則係於一月十一日由工部局總董協辦盛毓度氏，於召見銀樓業代表時，口頭規定爲三千元。最近由於條金黑市之狂漲不已，若干銀樓復提高飾金售價致遭嚴懲。衆料條金黑市，果能澈底根絕，則不但一般物價可期不再遭受意外之刺激，而銀樓業所請放寬飾金限價問題，亦將迎刃而解決。</p>

<h3>股份有限公司設立須知（三）</h3>
<p>（甲）法律規定之要點。</p>
<p>五、董事之名額　公司法第一三八條規定：「公司董事最少五人，由股東會就股東中選任之。」故章程中應明白規定董事若干人，如公司定爲九人則應訂明董事九人；如因名額尙未議定，而在章程中訂爲「董事九人成十一人，」則於法不合。董事名額須定單數，雙數亦不合法。</p>
<p>六、股票之發行　公司法第一一四條載：「公司非經設立登記，不得發行股票。違成前項規定發行股票者，其股票無效；但持票人得對於發行股票人請求損害賠償。」則公司發行股票，必須在辦理設立登設之後；但因設立登記，頗需相當時間，故股東所持之股款收據，務須妥爲保存，以備將來換領股票之用。</p>
<p>七、董監之報酬　公司法第一四〇條及一五三條規定：「董事監察人之報酬，未經章程訂明者，應由股東會議定。」故如章程內訂有明文，自可按照章程提派；如章程未明白規定者，則須提經股東會議決數額，不能隨意支取。</p>
<p>八、設立登記　公司法第一〇九條規定，股份全由發起人認足者，應於主管官署騐資完結後，股份非由發起人認足者，應於創立會完結後，十五日內，由董事將下列事項向主管官署聲請登記：（一）（一）公司名稱，（二）所營事業，（三）股份總額及每股金額，（四）本店支店及其所在地，（五）公司爲公告之方法。（二）各股已繳之金額，（三）董事及監察人之姓名住所，（四）定有解散事由者，其事由，等語。按公司登記規則第二條，第三條及第七條載明，主管官署在省爲實業廳（現由建設廳主管），在特別市爲社會局；呈請登記之呈文及附件，均須備具一式兩份，俟主管官署審核後，轉呈實業部核准登記，頒發執照。迨此手續完成，則設立公司在法律方面之程序，即告葳事。</p>

<h3>時間</h3>
<p>— 于天</p>
<p>在時間的過程中，劃分着「現在」「過去」和「未來」的三個階段。</p>
<p>過去的時間，沒有什麼意義，雖然那裏面充滿了「經騐」的痕跡，但多半是陳舊的，腐敗的，不値得回顧的。一個人在追憶過去的時候，常常會使他傷心，因爲生命的創痕，會引起他心裏的隱痛。若是過去是美滿的，又會使他對現實不發生與趣，消失了生活的意志，一味的縈廻往事，只在夢裏求安慰，因而頽唐，懊惱，消極，不圖長進。所以祇想過去，多少是含有毒素的。</p>
<p>未來的時間，太覺渺茫，在幻想的天國裏過日子，雖然是飄然意遠，其樂無窮，但是一旦睜開眠來，面前景物全非。不免要長吁短嘆，詛咒世界，因而放縱，失望，悲觀，脫離了生活的常軌，哭喪着臉，似乎一切已不可爲了，甚至毀滅了自己的生命，甘爲「殉道」者流，這樣算是「結束」。所以憧憬未來，終究是空虛的。</p>
<p>我覺得最寳貴的是現在的時間，它旣無毒素，又不空虛，脚踏實地的幹去，最有價値，不過「現在」所遭遇的也有「順」「逆」的不同。我們就得牢記「順」時當然須好好的安排，「逆」時也得不辭一切妳掙扎才是。要知道「現在」在不久以後就成了「過去」而在不久以前也是「未來」，所以只要努力獲得美滿的「現在」，就不用去撫摩往日的創痕，也不要去堆砌那空中的樓閣了，</p>
<p>生命的航程，在時間的大海裏前進，風濤險惡，自然是免不了，在一個老練的舟子，他固然接受來路的敎訓，也預測着去路的安全，但最緊要的，他知道還是把穩了舵柄，一秒一分一寸一尺的前行，堅毅的勇敢的向着彼岸。</p>
<h3>一個被開除的孩子</h3>
<p>— 史軍</p>
<p>教師日記之一　社會問題？兒童問題？</p>
<p>昨天校裏舉行了一個校務臨時會議。爲了我是五六年級的級任導師，而這回討論的又是關於五六年級的事，所以即使已經請了一個星期的病假，也得抱病參加。</p>
<p>出席的除了敎務主任吳外，完全是敎五六年級的幾位敎師，吳首先報告出曹視龍—五年級的一個最頑皮的孩子，—前天犯了一個大罪：偷了女生王瑞香的一枝自來水鋼筆是曹祖龍的同座黃林寳告密的，經靑三詰問和偵察的結果，「該犯」自己也「直承不諱」。</p>
<p>於是爲維護校風以儆效尤起見，吳主張要開除學籍，沈，林，唐，都贊成了，我，當然沒有話說，服從大多數的意見。</p>
<p>於是立刻一封信寄給了「貴家長」。</p>
<p>今天我拖着病剛好的身體上課時，第三排上多了一個空座位，也不看見那個熟悉的活躍的黑臉。</p>
<p>像失去了什麼似的，我楞了好久。我沒和孩子們講起曹祖龍的事，因爲也許我會講不過他們，平時曹祖龍的活躍，常是被我讚許的，而他和大部份的同學們都很好，聰明，力氣，使他儼然成了一個領袖。</p>
<p>我也在他們和她們天眞的小臉上隱約地看到惆悵，看到悲哀。—他們也許已經知道這回事了。</p>
<p>可是使我感到意外的吃驚地當晚上走進弄堂時，一隻小手在黑暗裏抓住了我。</p>
<p>「是我，史先生！」熟悉的活躍的聲音更在黑暗裏。</p>
<p>「曹祖龍？」</p>
<p>「是的！史先生」！聲音有點變了。</p>
<p>我將他帶回了家裏。</p>
<p>「幹嗎這麼晚到這兒來？」我很奇怪。</p>
<p>「史先生！」燈光下我看見悲裏黑臉上的充滿了淚水的眼睛，不再有活躍的勇敢的神氣了：「您能不能……再…再讓我讀下去？……」</p>
<p>「……」我冷冷地搖搖頭。</p>
<p>「史先生！……」幾乎哭了出來。</p>
<p>「誰叫你偷同學的東西！」我看着桌子，「這是沒有辦法的事！」</p>
<p>「我知道這是我…我的不好！」顫抖着的手擦着流下來的淚水：「但是這……這也不是我……我情願做的……沒有辦法……」</p>
<p>「怎麼？誰强迫你？」我更奇怪了。</p>
<p>「父親說：房錢三個月……沒付了！」斷斷續續的抽咽的聲音，「……現在巳到年底，……再不付…就要…趕…趕出去了……可是父親…已經有四個月…沒有做生意了！……一個錢也沒有……</p>
<p>「但是你不應該就因此偷人家的東西！」</p>
<p>「隔壁馬老爹前回偶然講起……他看見人買了一枝鋼筆二首塊……三個月房錢只有…只有五十四塊……她正巧落在地上……我就……誰知道…父親賣給人家只賣到三十塊！…還是不够！……</p>
<p>我默然了。</p>
<p>「…也不知道怎麼會…會給黃林寳看見……昨天…吳先生沈先生…都問我……史先生以前講過…誠實是最好的……我就說了……現在…又把我…」</p>
<p>他忽然開始伏在桌上低泣起來。</p>
<p>「哭又什麼用呢？」</p>
<p>「這…又不是…我…我情願的！」他止住了淚水，從袋裏摸出了一張折得很皺的二角角票，毫不遲疑地放在我面前：「我現在…預備聚…聚滿三十塊錢……還…還給她…史先生替我藏着……」</p>
<p>「好的！」我呆望着那張撫摸了很久的舊角票。</p>
<p>「—那麼我能不能再讀下去呢？」充滿了淚痕的黑臉像囚犯期待着最後的判決似的望着我的臉，眼睛裏充滿了希望</p>
<p>「……」我默然地搖搖頭。</p>
<p>黑臉上立刻　罩着一層　望的陰影，眼睛裏的希望倐的消滅了。</p>
<p>「史先生！謝謝你！」—是最後的掙扎：「…我在弄堂裏等了許多時候了！」</p>
<p>「……我默然地搖搖頭。</p>
<p>他絕望地看了一下房間的一切，終於默默地走出房門，走下樓梯，默默地走出後門。</p>
<p>我跟他出去。</p>
<p>「你不應該摒棄了一個聰明誠實而很快懺悔的孩子！」—我的耳邊響起了鐵一般的聲音。</p>
<p>「曹祖龍！」我叫起來。「你—你每天晚上到我這兒來！」</p>
<p>他起初不懂似的呆望着我，終於撲到我的身上上：</p>
<p>「史先生！你眞……」</p>
<p>「回去吧！」</p>
<p>「我明天再帶二角錢來！」在弄堂口他忽然回過頭來，大聲地叫着。</p>
<h3>碗小飯又少，如此怎够飽？</h3>

<h3>讀「保富法」後有感</h3>
<p>— 唐敬德</p>
<p>我讀—聶雲台先生的保富法後，覺得非常感動，不由得拉雜成文，也來獻醜一下。記得在我小時候，常聽得祖父和人談起說：「我辛勞了一世，並沒有金錢田地可以傳給子孫。蓋子孫賢慧，要牠來何用？子孫不賢，要牠來更屬何用？不如積德於冥冥之中，可使子孫享用不盡。」他老人家的用意是：出了好子孫，子孫自會掙錢過活，所以說要金錢田地等遺產來何用；假使出了壤子孫，雖然老子有一筆優厚的遺產，亦可揮霍於頃刻之間，那末要來更屬何用，豈不是反害了子孫輩驪？（富例已見聶先生保富法）所以積德於冥冥之中，可使子孫用之不盡，取之無竭。</p>
<p>那末此處就要問何謂「積德」？積德就是保富的唯一方法。最簡括的答案就是不損人利己，進一步更要視環境去幫助人家，甚至救濟人家，這就是積德。因爲人人能輕看權利，着重義務，人人以服務爲先提，以助人濟人爲目標，豈非直接地助了自己救了自己嗎？古人說：「助人自助」，就是這個意思。</p>
<p>說到助人濟人，中間還有一個愛字，因爲無愛人之心，就談不到助人濟人。醫如你在路上碰到乞丐來向你求乞，你見了他的外表，早已生了厭惡之心，不由他開口，你早就揮手喝滾，那怎麼濟得人呢？原因很簡單，中間缺少一個「愛」——惻隱之心的緣故。不過你如果能體騐孔子的一句話「能近取譬」，那你就很願意幫助他了。意思是：你把自己譬爲當時　乞丐，同時以乞丐醫爲富者，你向他求乞，他揮手叫你滾，你覺得難堪嗎？這樣的一忖，你就願意慷慨解囊了</p>
<p>孔子說：「汛愛眾，而親仁。」要叫人廣泛的愛護大衆，就近乎「仁」了。「仁」字从一人，凡表示有同情心可都可稱爲「仁」，韓退之在原道篇中解說得最澈底，他說：「博愛之謂仁」。耶穌也曾說：「愛人如己。」人人都愛自己，並他的父母妻子子女，而對於親族友朋就比較的疏遠了，對不認識的人更其差遠了。孟子說：「老吾老，以及人之老，幼吾幼，以及人之幼。」推而廣之，自愛護自己的父母子女推愛到別人的父母子女。須知大家有飯吃，而後自己纔有飯吃，大家能安於生活，樂於作業，而後自己能得安逸生活，不然你一個人富了，人們都貧窮了，即使你又不肯濟施。窮人都挺身走了險，不是你就直接的受了損害？換句話說，財富即不能保有。這就是不能推愛及人的後果。</p>
<p>際此時期，上海的暴利者是相當的多，他們一旦發了財，但求滿足他們的慾望，繼而謀物質和精神上的過度享受。他們顧不得將來，顧不得子孫，更顧不得饔飱不繼的衆生，他們有的是貨物，希望的是物價的高漲，想古人積穀濟荒，今人囤貨待價，這種情形眞不可同日而語矣。</p>
<p>老實說：一個人來時旣兩手空空，去時也兩手空空，就看幹的一番事業怎樣罷了，有的世無所聞；有的名傳不朽；有的子孫世代不衰；有的子孫默默無聞，這要看各人的怎樣做法了。梁臣公說：「人生最快樂的莫如盡了责任。」這個「責任」就是對己對人對社會國家的「事」，也可說是服務。對一番事做得有抬有終，於服務周誠勤勞這就算盡了責任。責任盡了，一身輕鬆二覺得精神上有無窮的安慰和快樂。</p>
<p>古人云：「爲善　樂」·「爲善」是對人盡了責任，就是助了人濟了人；間接的對社會國家盡責任。盡了責任，所以最爲快樂。還聽得老年人常說；「家寬不如心寬」。家寬是富有。不過富有的人並不一定心寬，心寬的人能致家寬。原來心寬就是爲善；爲善　盡了責任；盡責就可說是「德」；積德乃是保富的唯一方法。所以我的結論是：</p>
<p>利人即是利己，</p>
<p>保富何若散富。</p>

<h3>On the European Situation</h3>
<p>Currently, the focal points of the world war are in the East, with the operations in the Pacific, and in the West, with Europe, particularly the Soviet Union battlefield. The Red Army's winter counteroffensive, in addition to being demonstrated by the lifting of the siege of Stalingrad, further resulted in the retreat of German forces from the Caucasus, Kursk, and Rostov. Although we are not military experts and cannot offer accurate assessments, judging from the speech given on the 18th of this month by German Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, the severity of the European situation cannot be denied. Goebbels pointed out: "The Battle of Stalingrad is indeed the greatest warning to the German people. The lessons of this winter war should have awakened the European people from their delusions. The Bolshevik rulers, with their strict methods, concealed their national conditions, which led us to fail to make an accurate assessment of their combat potential at the beginning of the war. Now, the enormity of their combat power has been revealed, so we must now engage them with the strength of the entire nation." He also specifically and solemnly pointed out the following: namely, "(1) If the German army fails to conquer this crisis, then Germany and Europe will successively be ravaged by Bolshevism; (2) But Germany is now fighting alongside its allies and does indeed have the power to save Europe from this crisis; (3) Now that the crisis is imminent, we must recognize reality and deal with it effectively." Extrapolating from his speech, the aim is to awaken the German people from their dream of a swift victory and promote greater efforts by Germany; and even more meaningfully, it is to awaken the people of neutral countries and anti-Axis countries such as Britain and the United States, so that they can recognize reality and switch to Germany's anti-Bolshevik front. Therefore, Goebbels pointed out with deep sorrow: If the world's strongest military power, Germany, cannot conquer this red peril, then what country in the world can bear this difficult task? The current neutral countries in Europe do not have the power to resist even slightly; Soviet mechanized units can ravage various countries within a few days. If Europe truly falls into the hands of the Soviet Union, then Britain and the United States will also be powerless. Moreover, "at that time, London cannot guarantee that it will only remain in Europe and will not cross the Channel." It is very clear that this is to awaken the neutral countries of Europe and the countries of Britain and the United States. However, if these words are hastily mistaken to mean that Germany has already encountered a fatal blow in its war against the Soviet Union, and that the European war will immediately undergo astonishing changes, this would of course be a great mistake. Today, on the one hand, we must recognize reality and recognize that the Red Army's winter counteroffensive has already created a new situation in the European war. This situation will force the neutral countries of Europe to decide their own paths, and it will also force Britain and the United States to reconsider their future actions. As for the current task of the Axis countries, it is to cooperate more closely, concentrate all the forces that can be mobilized, and prepare for the decisive battle when spring and summer come. On the other hand, we must also estimate the actual situation on the side of the anti-Axis countries: First, to what extent will military cooperation between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union develop? Can Britain and the United States trust the Soviet Union to stop before the borders of Germany and continue to cooperate? Do Britain and the United States have the strength to take advantage of the new situation created by the winter war and further open the so-called second front in Southeastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and the West? And will neutral countries make decisive new decisions in light of the new situation? These questions are all questions that will determine the future course of the war. Only from the study of these questions, coupled with an accurate estimate of the new forces that Germany and the Soviet Union may be able to mobilize, can we more accurately grasp the future of the European war situation.</p>
<p>The German authorities do not shy away from the adverse trends in the winter war and the "enormous combat power of the Soviet Union" that has already been "revealed," but the German side clearly has not been discouraged. As Goebbels said in his speech on the 18th: "Today's Germany, everyone has no thought of compromise, and the entire people have embraced the will to fight hard... We must exterminate it and never give up halfway; this is the duty that National Socialism should fulfill. Now that the war has developed to its highest point, Germany will never waver in its fighting spirit and will definitely end this war with victory." And the way for Germany to win is through the increased efforts of the German people. This point is fully expressed in the questions that Goebbels raised to the people during his speech: "Do you deeply believe that we will obtain final victory? Are you determined to go through fire and water, following the Führer? If the Führer demands that you work fourteen to sixteen hours a day, are you willing to obey? Is your faith in the Führer even stronger than before? Do you support cracking down on those who loaf on the job?" The positive and affirmative answers to these questions have a decisive significance for Germany's final victory. Therefore, he asked his people: "You should only think about the war and not think about anything else... During full mobilization, all luxury facilities should be closed down." But as he said, "Today's crisis is not only suffered by Germany alone; all of Europe is suffering it," so he cannot but demand that the resources of Germany and German-controlled Europe must be thoroughly developed. At the same time, "The German people are sacrificing their flesh and blood to protect Europe, and Europe should also exchange labor. We don't need to discuss whether the methods we use are good or bad; we should only discuss whether they are successful."</p>
<p>However, when we talk about the European war situation, there is still one point that absolutely cannot be ignored: due to the international nature of modern world war, the war in Europe is closely related to the war in East Asia. To estimate the future of the European war situation, we must also estimate the existence of this situation on the East Asian battlefield, so that the enormous combat power of Britain and the United States cannot be completely used in the war against Europe. The second European front, which has been shouted for more than a year, cannot be opened up. In addition to the suspicion and disloyalty of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union, the heavy blows of the East Asian war to Britain and the United States are indeed one of the most important reasons. At a time when the so-called "Four-Power Conference" of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is strengthening its "counteroffensive" plan, the accurate maintenance of Japan's offensive in the Pacific cannot but be said to be Germany's strongest aid. And Japan's further actions in the future will naturally be another important factor in determining the European war situation. The statements of the relevant responsible authorities in Japan in recent days, as well as the establishment and promotion of China's wartime political, economic, and military policies, all show how great a force East Asia is exerting on the world war situation.</p>
<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3>The Astonishing Results of the South Pacific War</h3>
<p>According to the announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters, the necessary foundation for the Japanese army to conduct new operations in the South Pacific has been consolidated. The war in this area can be said to have entered a new stage. One of the conclusions of the previous stage of the war is that the Imperial Navy's war results in this area that have not been announced in the past half-year were announced by the General Headquarters on the evening of the 13th, totaling: 16 ships sunk and damaged, 237 aircraft shot down, and 10 ships sunk and damaged. During the same period, the damage to enemy forces by the Japanese naval forces, which has been confirmed, totaled: 6 battleships sunk, 4 damaged, other ships 6124, 1074 aircraft, and more than 30 ships. Here, they all prove how admirable the military power of the Japanese army is. Although Britain and the United States call themselves "great powers," from the numbers, we can infer the great consumption of combat power. What will their leaders think when they see this?</p>
<p>Especially after the disastrous defeat in the initial battles, the panicked Britain and the United States took extremely bleak and cautious measures to deal with this situation, trying their best to hide the truth of the damage from the people. However, the subsequent damage was even greater than the blows suffered in the initial battles, and there is no room for concealment now. What enemy leaders fear most is the exposure of reality. Therefore, they create empty rhetoric in order to boost the morale of the people, but the seams are often attached to false treasures. Roosevelt once said, "We will attack from this island to that island and defeat Japan." Navy Secretary Knox also said, "We will take back the islands of the Pacific one by one and do not want to attack Tokyo." Both are dreaming. No matter what method the enemy uses, we are not afraid. If they come from the South Pacific, the pain they suffered in the previous stage will definitely be seen again in the next stage of the war!

<h3>German and Italian Forces Occupy Bīxióng; British and American Forces Retreat Southward; German Forces in Tunisia Recapture 4,000 Square Miles of Land in Four Days</h3>
<p>Havas Agency Dispatch from the capital of Switzerland, the 19th: According to news from the Axis and British and American sides, the Italian and German forces in southern Tunisia continue to make progress and have reached the vicinity of the Weifa grassland, within 15 miles of the Algerian border! The Allied side admits that the Axis forces have achieved their goal of expanding the gap between the British Eighth Army and the First Army. Bīxióng, the weakest point in the Allied defense line (25 miles west of Kairoan), has almost fallen into German hands. The remnants of the Allied forces have retreated south from the Duc district in Bīxióng. The Berlin Radio Station claims that the German and Italian Allied forces have retreated from the mountainous area at the southern end of the White Horse Sz Line. The British Eighth Army continues to attack the outposts on the southern flank of General Rommel's troops. After fierce fighting in the mountains, the German and Italian Allied forces retreated to their main positions with lightning speed. The war continues on the southern flank of the Axis forces, but the British Desert Division has not yet engaged in combat with the main force of General Rommel's troops. It is heard that most of the Mareth Line is defended by Italian troops. The line is protected by three dry riverbeds. The French built solid fortifications here before the war, and it can only be threatened from the direction of Gafsa. After occupying Gafsa, this threat has been eliminated. The Axis forces have laid a large minefield between Bèngjiā Nà and Huá Dí Mǎlèsī. The Mareth Line also has the advantage of connecting with the rest of Tunisia by rail. The remnants of the American army are trying to stop the German advance in the mountains southeast of Tébessa in order to retreat southward and take cover in the deep mountains. As of now, the number of American prisoners has reached 3,000. The German army has captured a large number of tanks and military equipment. The American side admits that the number of American tanks that have fallen into the hands of the Axis forces is more than enough to compensate for the losses of the Axis forces in the last few days of the war in Tunisia. The Axis forces now occupy the main position southeast of the Atlas Mountains, and the American army is retreating on all fronts. At the same time, the Allied war report in North Africa claims that there are not many battles in southern Tunisia. Allied aircraft bombed various targets in Fériana and the northern road. The British Eighth Army has completed the occupation of the Gabès Island near the coast of Tunisia. In addition, the Axis air force is also very active in Tunisia, shooting down several Allied aircraft in one day. It is said that the Axis torpedo planes have struck enemy convoys in the Mediterranean, hitting four enemy ships, two of which sank. The damaged ones are one light cruiser and one 10,000-ton transport ship. Both London and Washington are extremely anxious about the development of the Tunisian front. The London Times frankly admits that the Allied forces in Tunisia have been greatly weakened and that a thorough reorganization of the Allied forces in North Africa is urgently needed.</p>
<p>German Forces Reach the Algerian Border</p>
<p>Alliance News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 20th: According to news received here last night from the Axis and Allied sides, the Axis forces led by German General Arnim are expanding their victories after winning in Gafsa and Fait in Tunisia and are driving the American army out of the southeastern area of the Atlas Mountains, rapidly approaching the Algerian border. News from Berlin said that the American army had fled on a broad front, and the Axis vanguard had crossed the railway from Sbeitla to Floriana and reached the foothills of the Atlas Mountains southeast of Tébessa (Note: Tébessa is outside the Algerian border). This statement has been confirmed by the Reuters correspondent on the Tunisian front, who reported last night that the Axis forces had advanced in the far south and reached the Nafte grassland within 15 miles of the Algerian border. "Today's News" believes that Bīxióng, the weakest point in the Allied mountain defense line, is in the hands of the German army. Bīxióng is 15 miles west of Kairoan, and the French army has retreated from the Duc district south of Bīxióng to the ridge on the west side of the Oseltia Valley. Furthermore, according to news from Berlin, the American war zone has been breached extensively. On Thursday, an American infantry brigade flanked in the Chiraipud district to block the advance of the German and Italian vanguard, but was repulsed. The Axis forces have captured 3,000 enemy soldiers so far and seized a large number of tanks and cars. In addition, they have destroyed 169 enemy tanks, 95 trucks, 102 cannons, and many transport vehicles. A British division has now been transferred from the north to reinforce the American army in the south. At the same time, on the border between Tunisia and Tripolitania, the British Eighth Army infantry, assisted by heavy artillery, attacked the German outposts on Thursday. According to news from Berlin, fierce fighting is taking place on the southern side of the Axis forces. The Axis outposts have retreated into the main position, but the British army has not yet made contact with the main force of the German army.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, the 20th: U.S. Secretary of War Stimson's announcement regarding the losses of the American army in Tunisia is said to be 3,333 killed in action, 6,500 wounded, 6,132 captured, and 115,684 missing. We have no way of knowing the truth of these numbers. All we know is the number of prisoners. As for the huge number of missing, it can be seen that many American transport ships have been sunk. Stimson also said that the Axis forces in Tunisia now outnumber the Allied forces.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 20th: A New York dispatch said that the New York Herald Tribune reported yesterday that Rommel has begun to use his disintegration tactics again. Rommel, after defeating the American air force, eliminated the threat to the rear of the Mareth Line and made it impossible for the Allied forces to counterattack.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 20th: According to a dispatch from Algiers, the anti-Axis command announced on the 19th: 1. The American army was fiercely attacked by a German mechanized division and retreated to a place more than 100 kilometers from the Algerian border. 2. Led by 50-ton heavy tanks, the German army recaptured 4,000 square miles of territory in four days. The American army suffered heavy losses in both manpower and material resources.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 20th: According to news from the Reuters front correspondent in Algiers, the French rebel army also retreated from the Fu'en Ge area in central Tunisia on the 19th, southward towards the Oseltia Valley south of Bīxióng.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Rome, the 20th: According to news from here, the Tunisian governor sent his prime minister to Kairoan to express his condolences to the residents who suffered from the British and American air raids on the city. He also donated 90,000 francs as a relief fund.</p>
<p>America's Defeat Alarms Britain</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, the 20th: The British were greatly alarmed after learning of the defeat of the American army in Tunisia, believing that the meeting of the British forces in Tunisia, both north and south, would become more difficult, and that the difficulties faced by General Montgomery's troops would be even greater. Although the London authorities have remained silent on the defeat of the American army, the general feeling is quite indignant. Clement Davies, a Liberal member of Parliament, wrote in the News Chronicle, accusing the Americans of being fools and advocating that American generals and officers should receive more training.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, the 20th: "The Swedish Daily News London correspondent said that London is increasingly uneasy about the situation in Tunisia. Although British military figures believe that the American army can stop the continued advance of the Axis forces, they have to admit that the loss of three important airfields is a heavy blow to the Allied forces. If the Allies want to avoid further setbacks, the British army should come to the aid of the American army." In the eyes of the British Observer, the final victory in the Tunisian war must belong to the Allies, but the British newspapers believe that the war has a tendency to prolong and cannot be ended in a short period of time. The London correspondent of the Swedish "Daily News" said that, according to British opinions, Marshal Rommel has achieved three goals in the recent war: (1) He shattered the Allied plan to cut off the Axis retreat route; (2) The Allied attempt to use Tunisia as a springboard to launch a new offensive could not be realized; (3) He cut off the connection between the British First Army and the Eighth Army, putting the Allied forces in a disadvantageous position.</p>
<h3>In the Nantong Area, the Japanese Army Attacks the New Fourth Army, Killing More Than 150 People</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Shanghai: A certain unit of the Japanese army, in order to respond to the encirclement and annihilation war launched against the Eighth Ninth Army of the Chongqing army, began to advance northward towards Nantong on the 17th and encountered about 500 men of the New Fourth Army. After two hours of fierce fighting, most of them were annihilated. In this battle, 158 corpses of the Communist army were buried, 89 prisoners were captured, and 1 heavy machine gun, 2 light machine guns, 72 rifles, 1,300 rounds of ammunition, 1 pistol, and many other military supplies were seized.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Shanghai: After the National Government announced its participation in the war, it actively cooperated with the Japanese army to establish a total mobilization posture between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and blockaded Chongqing, accelerating the collapse of its war economy. Recently, the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, in order to cooperate with the National Government's army to overthrow the Chongqing regime, has launched a spring offensive. It began operations in the Suhuai area on the 13th. With the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese armies, it has defeated the main force of the Chongqing Eighth Ninth Army entrenched in the area. Then it turned to attack the main force of the Third Division of the New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu, which continued to be active centering on Fùníng, inflicting heavy damage on it. The significance of this operation lies in preemptively stopping the Chongqing army's actions in order to expand the peace zone. At the same time, the Japanese army in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River started operations from Shashi and Nanchang, fiercely attacking the Chongqing army in the Ninth and Sixth war zones, launching a two-front war and severely damaging the Chongqing direct army, which boasted of being a model division. In addition, Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed Guilin, Liuzhou, and Hengyang Chongqing air bases since the beginning of the new year. The air force and base facilities on which Chongqing relied have been destroyed by Japanese aircraft. This has a very profound impact on Chongqing in both material and psychological terms. Moreover, the National Government's army fought side by side with the Japanese army in the Suhuai area, which fully demonstrates the spirit of shared destiny between China and Japan.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Says Aid to Chongqing Is Difficult</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 20th: According to a dispatch from Washington, Roosevelt and Soong Mei-ling met with a group of reporters on the 19th. Soong Mei-ling once again pleaded with the United States to strengthen aid to Chongqing. In response, Roosevelt said that the US government is also willing to send military supplies to Chongqing, but the problem is transportation is difficult. At present, there is no other way except for air transport. Transport aircraft must carry as much gasoline as possible back and forth between China and US bases in the South Pacific. From a geographical point of view, it is clear how difficult it is to aid Chongqing.</p>
<h3>The US Weapons Lend-Lease Bureau Sets Up a China Section; Aid to the Soviet Union Slightly Increases Compared to Before</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 19th: According to a dispatch from Washington, US Weapons Lend-Lease Bureau Director Stettinius announced on the 18th that a new China section has been set up within the bureau. The first director is Mr. Ray. On the 18th, Mr. Ray met with a group of reporters and made a statement as follows: 50% of the materials that the United States lends to Chongqing are currently placed in India due to transportation difficulties. Since the closure of the Burma Road, the only way to transport materials to Chongqing is by using airplanes.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 20th: According to a dispatch from Washington, although Chongqing has repeatedly asked the United States to strengthen aid, it has not yet been realized. At a time when the dark clouds between the United States and Chongqing have not cleared, US Weapons Lend-Lease Bureau Director Stettinius suddenly announced on the 19th that US aid to the Soviet Union is increasing every month. The main points of his statement are recorded below: US material aid to the Soviet Union increased by 10% in January of this year compared to December of last year. A large amount of materials will continue to be transported every month in the future. Since the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act, the United States has supplied the Soviet Union with a total of 2.9 million tons of military supplies, two-thirds of which were transported by US ships.</p>
<h3>After the Governor-General's Administration: An Overview of Hong Kong's Construction - Establishing a New Economic System in Hong Kong - Rapid Development of Various Industries</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 20th (Central News Agency) - It has been a year since the Governor-General's Office of Occupied Hong Kong began its administration on February 20th of last year. During this year, thanks to the efforts of the Governor-General's Office, a new economic system has been established in Hong Kong. Moreover, due to the effective implementation of controlled economy, Hong Kong's industries have achieved rapid development. As we enter the second year of construction, we will summarize the current situation and future prospects of the main sectors of Hong Kong's construction as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Trade</p>
<p>Hong Kong's position in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is extremely important. It is currently recognized as a distribution port for the sphere. To facilitate Hong Kong shipping companies, the Governor-General's Office has lent a portion of its warehouses to eight shipping companies in Hong Kong for loading and unloading cargo at the docks. These eight companies established a stevedoring and warehousing company on the 18th of this month, aiming to maximize the function of the distribution port. Furthermore, an important part of Hong Kong's trade involves processing raw materials produced in the South and then exporting them. For example, according to the trade agreement established with the Philippines last October, large quantities of sugar, tobacco, and Manila hemp were imported, processed by local factories, and then re-exported to the South. Therefore, thanks to the efforts of various industrial sectors, Hong Kong's trade scope with Southeast Asia and China has been increasingly expanding. Recently, trade settlement methods have been determined with the South and various parts of the Mainland, namely (A) trade with Shonan (Singapore) and the Philippines will be settled using a special method, (B) trade with North China and Manchuria will be settled in Tokyo, and (C) trade with Central China will be settled using military scrip. After these settlement methods are determined, Hong Kong's trade with various regions will become more stable and smooth.</p>
<p>(2) Shipbuilding</p>
<p>Maritime Transport: Hong Kong's shipbuilding facilities are among the best in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. After the Japanese army occupied it, they immediately began restoration. The construction and repair of ships is progressing extremely smoothly, especially the construction of wooden motorized junks. To enhance Hong Kong's transport capacity, these wooden motorized junks are now being used for the transportation of materials between Hong Kong and the South. Sailing junks and wooden boats are also being utilized as a major supplement to local transportation. The owners of these sailing junks have now formed a Sailing Junk Transportation Association, specializing in coastal transport. Currently, regular sailing routes have begun from the islands under the jurisdiction of Occupied Hong Kong to Jiangmen, Taipingmen at the mouth of the Pearl River, as well as Shantou and Guangzhou Bay.</p>
<p>(3) Industry</p>
<p>Hong Kong's important industries include refrigeration, cigarette manufacturing, hydrochloric acid, dyes, nail manufacturing, beverages, beer, sugar refining, cement, hydrochloric acid, etc. Currently, they are all resuming operations under the management of the Governor-General's Office. The Governor-General's Office has also decided to soon return these factories to private management. Over 700 small factories run by Chinese that have been permitted to resume operations, mostly manufacturing textiles, food products, and miscellaneous goods, will soon begin operations. To promote the prosperity of Chinese residents, the Governor-General's Office has decided to provide as much convenience as possible.</p>
<p>(4) Finance</p>
<p>The Governor-General's Office promulgated the currency and exchange regulations for Occupied Hong Kong last July, with the intention of restricting enemy Hong Kong currency and strengthening the use of military scrip. This February, the military scrip exchange has expanded the exchange limit for Hong Kong currency from 200 yuan to 1,000 yuan, to facilitate the circulation of military scrip. The Governor-General's Office, recognizing the large number of people relying on Hong Kong currency for their livelihood, has made it clear that it will maintain the current . Twenty Chinese banks in Hong Kong have also resumed operations. The Governor-General's Office is now working to restore Chinese-run banks to normal operation as soon as possible, and the restriction on deposits will be lifted by the end of February or early March.</p>
<p>(5) Population</p>
<p>Question: The Governor-General's Office is now vigorously encouraging Chinese residents to return to their hometowns and providing them with convenient transportation. Approximately 900,000 people have already been evacuated from Hong Kong, and following recent consultations with the Guangdong authorities, effective promotion methods will be implemented starting in March. However, this return to hometowns is not only for population management but also based on the viewpoint of re-rationally distributing Hong Kong and Guangdong. Every effort will be made to ensure that returning people can live and work in peace and contentment, which will also greatly benefit agricultural production in South China.</p>

<h3>German Troops West of Kharkov Adopt Effective Defensive Warfare - Fierce Fighting Continues in the Donets Basin - Soviet Troops in Poltava Repelled</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front news, German troops west of Rostov have established fortified positions in the area of Matveyev Kurgan, 30 kilometers north of the important Sea of Azov port of Taganrog, to intercept the southward-moving Soviet troops. Fierce fighting is currently underway between the two armies. Furthermore, Soviet troops under General Malinovsky, attempting to engage the German troops in a decisive battle in the Don River estuary area, are continuously reinforcing with reserve forces, aiming to break through the German positions with a pincer attack. Due to the Soviet troops' day and night attacks, the German troops' operations seem quite difficult. According to news received on the afternoon of the 17th, the German troops are still firmly defending their original positions and have stopped the Soviet advance, but the situation is not necessarily optimistic. In the southern coalfield area of Voroshilovgrad, tank battles have occurred between German and Soviet troops in several locations. The terrain is muddy, making operations quite difficult.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Domei) - Military sources here stated last night that German troops west of Kharkov have adopted effective defensive warfare to stop the Soviet advance. Fierce fighting continued on Thursday and yesterday in the Donets Basin to the south. The main combat zone currently extends from the Kursk northern area to Novorossiysk along the entire southern front. However, Soviet troops in the Leningrad, Volkhov, and Lake Ilmen areas on the northwestern front have also launched repeated attacks. After German troops adopted a systematic action from Voroshilovgrad and Rostov to shorten the lines, Soviet troops exerted strong pressure in the Donets Basin. German troops are resisting and attacking at the same time, inflicting heavy damage on Soviet troops. Fierce battles are currently taking place west of Kharkov. Soviet troops attempted to advance towards Poltava but were repelled by German troops. Southwest of Kharkov, Soviet troops attacked with the aim of advancing towards the great bend of the Dnieper River but were defeated by German troops. German sources emphasized that Soviet troops did not make any progress in this area on Thursday but admitted that the Soviet commander has amassed significant forces, preparing to flank Kursk. North of Kursk, Soviet troops again attacked Orel on Thursday. German troops straightened the lines in several locations in the Livny area northeast of Kursk, thwarting the Soviet attempt to break through the German positions from the south of the salient. In the northwest Caucasus, on the Taman Peninsula, several Soviet units were annihilated. The German counterattack in Novorossiysk is tightening the encirclement of a Soviet force that recently landed in the area. Furthermore, German sources claim that the Soviet offensive on the northwestern front has not , resulting in losses of fourteen tanks and twenty-five aircraft. The Spanish Blue Division on the Leningrad front repelled the Soviet attack. The Soviet offensive on Volkhov was also defeated by German troops. South of Lake Ilmen, the Soviet invasion of the German defensive positions also collapsed. Further north, German-Finnish forces in the Kandalaksha area are encircling a Soviet unit and are currently in the process of annihilation.</p>

<h3>Eastern European Residents Willing to Join the German Army - Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency)</h3>
<p>Keishoff recently published an article in the "National Weekly" reviewing the situation in the occupied territories of Eastern Europe, stating that the people in that area deeply fear the repetition of Bolshevism. After Eastern Europe was occupied by German troops, a large number of residents requested the German command to allow them to join the German army and serve. Although the German command initially refused, given the earnestness of the requests, it was finally decided to give volunteers the opportunity to defend their homeland. This volunteer army includes Estonians, Lithuanians, Bessarabians, Western Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russians, all of whom are good soldiers. They are especially brave in winter's harsh climate. They have their own uniforms and commanders, and receive the same treatment as German troops on the Eastern Front. Even the orphans and widows of those killed in action receive German pensions. In addition to this volunteer army, German troops often receive assistance from local residents, such as transporting supplies and constructing roads and bridges. German authorities do not interfere with the religious customs and lifestyles of the local residents.</p>
<h3>Japan Takes Cautious Steps in Implementing the Abolition of Extraterritoriality in China - Minister Aoki Stated in Response to Questions from Diet Members - The Japanese House of Representatives Passed the Revised Conscription Law in Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Beijing, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - Japanese Embassy spokesman Kitazawa stated to reporters yesterday that the date for Japan's abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions has not yet been determined. On the European front, German troops are preparing for a spring or summer offensive, hence the voluntary withdrawal from Rostov and Kharkov.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese House of Representatives held a plenary session this afternoon and passed seven bills, including the revised Conscription Law sent by the House of Peers.

Therefore, the specific methods for abolishing this right must be implemented cautiously and gradually. Japan's return of concessions and the abandonment of extraterritoriality have had a far-reaching impact on enhancing the status of the National Government and are steps towards completing China's complete independence. Japan is now implementing the principles of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty with active actions, providing the National Government with new capabilities to carry out its task of revitalizing China. The National Government has further strengthened its determination to cooperate closely with Japan and expand its political and economic power at this time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces the Sinking of Enemy Ships - Japanese Air Force Launches Aviation Annihilation Warfare - To Make the Fate of American Troops as Perilous as a Stack of Eggs</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese Army and Navy troops consolidated the foundation for new operations and withdrew from Guadalcanal Island, the United States still greatly publicized the strategic value of the island. The 30,000 American troops under Patch were assigned as the vanguard of the South Pacific counteroffensive against Japan, while efforts were made to actively replenish them. However, since the beginning of the year, the Japanese Naval Air Force has strengthened its forces in that area and launched aviation annihilation warfare, fleet annihilation warfare, and base attack warfare at any time, engaging in cutting off enemy supply lines. For example, on the 17th of this month, a fierce attack was launched on a large enemy transport convoy escorted by two destroyers southeast of the island, immediately sinking two enemy destroyers and one transport ship, shattering the enemy's attempt to supply the island. On that day, naval reconnaissance aircraft first discovered a large transport convoy about 70 nautical miles south of San Cristobal Island. The Japanese Naval Air Force then pursued north, beginning to bombard the enemy convoy in the airspace about 20 nautical miles east of San Cristobal Island, braving the enemy destroyers' intense anti-aircraft fire and repeatedly bombing them.</p>
<p>Japanese cruiser fleets are active on the seas of the South, destroying enemy fleets amidst towering waves.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister to the Soviet Union Returns Home to Report</h3>

<h3>The Contents of Chongqing's "Price Control Bureau" - Daily Necessities Supply Stations Are Empty</h3>
<p>— Jin Yan</p>
<p>The Chongqing regime, in order to ease the people's minds, established the Price Control Bureau under the "Ministry of Economics," touting the supply of daily necessities. However, the reality is completely different. There are no goods to buy, prices are not controlled, and they are not even across the board. See below a letter from Chongqing citizen Jiang Jingsheng appealing to the public:</p>
<p>"Amidst rising prices, the government, thinking of the people's interests, established the "Price Control Bureau," setting up many daily necessities supply stations in the Chongqing city area and expanding to the suburbs. Even in remote areas, there are branch stores. The goods sold are of many varieties. All of their retail outlets are bustling all day long. For a few months, the citizens did indeed enjoy considerable benefits. However, for the past year, their business has been steadily declining, and their inventory has been dwindling. Initially, except for a few special goods (such as wool yarn and toothpaste), which were genuinely limited due to too many monks and too little porridge, restrictions were imposed with scheduled times and various procedures, which was an unavoidable measure. Strictly speaking, in "daily necessities," "daily essentials," especially in "supply stations," such strange phenomena are not permissible! Since they are called "daily essentials," they should be purchased sufficiently to avoid shortages. Otherwise, what else can they be called other than "essentials," what kind of "supply station" would they be? They are simply "supply inspection stations"! However, their inventory is not thought to be purchased in large quantities. They have gradually adopted the method of "snatching." Now, even the most common soap and matches are being sold in this way. Often, only one or two items are sold around one o'clock in the afternoon, forcing the nearby citizens to use all their life's strength to grab a pack of matches, or a bar of soap, or a pack of cigarettes, or a towel. Usually, their shelves are empty, busy for only half an hour a day, and the rest of the time, male and female shop assistants are chatting, drinking tea, and reading newspapers... Logically, if the Price Control Bureau really wants to follow the plan and hang up a sign to provide welfare for the people, I think there would be no difficulty. The store's regular inventory may not be said to be fuller than the stores, but at least it will not be shorter than the stores, let alone make the entire store empty and the staff sit idle with nothing to sell, and nothing to do. But the fact is in front of us, they are neither "supplying" nor "responding." They have long lost the meaning of the word "supply." On Sunday, I walked from Shaanxi Street to Shangqingsi, traversing the entire city. I paid special attention to each supply station, and they were all equally "empty." The staff chattered "eloquently." So I instinctively thought, "Such supply stations, it is better to close them down!" "Continuing to open them, our people are too inappropriate!" Please estimate, how many stations are there in the city and countryside, how large are the daily expenses, raising so many idle people, doing nothing all day, how wasteful is this! Recently, Fushengzhuang has also opened many retail outlets, and the business is as good as the situation when the Daily Necessities Public Sale Office was first opened. It is said that they both belong to the Material Bureau of the Ministry of Economics. They were originally a family, and the supply stations are idle enough to do nothing. Why not entrust them as agents? What other reason is there to need independent portals, and more than one operating expense and recurring expense? I really do not understand, is this not sheer waste? Are we even allowing such wasteful things in this stage of financial difficulty? I really have some bones in my throat, and I have to speak out. If you cannot regularly supply goods, simply merge or close them down! If there are scattered items in the future, if you want to give them to the citizens, you can use the patrol team to go to the suburbs and sell them at any time. Or imitate the method of rural fairs, which is not impossible! Why play such jokes? With no "real goods" displayed, you still call it a supply station!" (Mailed December 28, 1942)</p>

<h3>Burmese Princes Support the Government - Rangoon, 20th (Central News Agency)</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 18th, two Burmese men of extraordinary character visited Burmese Administrative Chief Ba Maw, who immediately received them.

In addition to expressing their congratulations on the impending restoration of sovereignty and the construction of a new nation, they also expressed their full support for the government under Japanese military administration. Chief Ba Maw expressed his deep gratitude and appreciation and stated that he would further strive for the construction of a new Burma. The main points of the two princes' conversation are recorded below: We, on behalf of the descendants of King Qi Bao, are willing to work for Burma, which has been granted the honor of nation-building by Japan. Burma, which has broken away from British domination due to Japan's great kindness, is now able to build a new nation with Japan's recognition, which is truly gratifying. The Burmese people are fully aware that they must unite and immediately strive to build a new Burma. When we recall the past oppression under British rule, we have infinite emotions.</p>
<p>Shonan, 20th (Central News Agency) - In view of the fact that various parts of Southeast Asia are now striving for food self-sufficiency, the Shonan Overseas Chinese Association previously recruited agricultural instructors trained by Engineer Goto of the Military Administration Department in order to cooperate with this policy and cultivate agricultural talents. At the moment, the instructors have completed their training and have been sent to work in various parts of Malaya, undertaking tasks such as guiding the reclamation of farmland, improving agricultural tools, and improving techniques. According to the past agriculture in Malaya, the traditional methods of cultivating the land have failed to achieve ideal harvests. It is expected that the cultivation methods in the future will be modernized due to the activities of these instructors, which will make a great contribution to increasing agricultural production.</p>

He was slightly better on the morning of the 19th and slept for a short while. His physical condition is extremely weak, and his heartbeat is very faint.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 20th, Huitong News Agency - A dispatch from the capital of India states that Gandhi's attending physicians yesterday forbade visitors from meeting with Gandhi, only allowing family members to enter and offer their regards. It is said that Gandhi's condition has worsened compared to before.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th, Havas News Agency - According to a report from Poona, Gandhi's condition worsened again on the eleventh day of his hunger strike. Nine doctors are currently attending to him. Gandhi's eldest son arrived in Poona last night, and his second son, a newspaper editor, also departed from New Delhi yesterday.</p>
<p>Calls for Release Increase Daily</p>
<p>Bangkok, 20th, Huitong News Agency</p>
<p>The call for the unconditional release of Gandhi is increasing daily in various parts of India. The Bengal Legislative Council passed a resolution yesterday calling for the unconditional release of Gandhi. One hundred and fifty Indian political leaders held a meeting in New Delhi and also appointed a committee to draft a resolution calling for the unconditional release of Gandhi. The resolution is scheduled to be voted on today. The chairman of the meeting is former Madras Prime Minister Rajagopalachari, who has met with Sir Bertrand and President Roosevelt's representative, Philip.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 20th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Indian all-party conference initiated by Rajagopalachari was held in New Delhi on the 19th. More than one hundred representatives from various parties across India participated. A drafting committee was immediately formed to draft a petition to the Viceroy of India requesting the immediate release of Gandhi. The petition was originally intended to be submitted on the 20th, but because Gandhi's physical strength has deteriorated daily, there is no time to lose. The drafting committee submitted the draft petition to the Viceroy's Secretary on the same day.</p>
<p>Overseas Indians in Britain Concerned About Gandhi</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th, Huitong News Agency - According to news from London, reports received last night are very pessimistic about Gandhi's health condition. Indians in London are praying for Gandhi and have sent a delegation to the House of Commons to distribute leaflets to members, demanding Gandhi's immediate release. It is said that several Labour Party members have already written to Gandhi, reporting that they have raised the demand for his release.</p>
<h3>Various Comments, Goebbels' Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th, Huitong News Agency - German political reports state that Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels' ten questions to the German people are what Germany should deal with during this difficult period. The news that the Germans have received in the past few weeks is the most serious in many years. Everyone is concerned, and no one can stand idly by. Goebbels frankly admitted that Germany underestimated the Soviet Union. A Chinese proverb says, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated." How true this is! Today, the Germans no longer have unrealistic fantasies about the Soviet Union. Whoever wants to defeat the Soviet Union in the Soviet climate has no other way than to be accustomed to the climate of that country. Germany's mistake was that while carrying out the annihilation of the Soviet Union, it also adhered to the life of Central Europe. Germany can now learn from this lesson and surely wash away the recent humiliation. There is no doubt.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Rome, 20th, Huitong News Agency - The Italian newspaper "Avvenire" commented on Goebbels' speech yesterday, saying that although the German army's withdrawal from Kharkov marks the entry of the Eastern Front war into an emergency state, Germany has mobilized its national strength to deal with the Soviet Union to the end. "Tribune" commented that the Soviet Union's alliance with Western democratic countries is actually to use them to carry out its world revolution, and democratic countries have no power to stop it. Therefore, the Allied countries are now in a dilemma.</p>
<h3>Practicing Wartime Living, Household Electricity Conservation</h3>
<p>Under the major premise of conserving materials during wartime, efforts to minimize the consumption of unnecessary goods have been repeatedly emphasized by the authorities, and there is no need to elaborate. Electricity conservation is also one of the most essential material conservation practices that citizens should adopt. When not needed, of course, there is no need to turn on the lights. Even when necessary, one should concentrate on working with the minimum number of lights, reducing the number of lights used as much as possible.</p>
<p>If a 30-watt light bulb is used for five hours a day, saving one bulb can save 4.5 kilowatts per month. Although the amount is small, it accumulates to a considerable figure. Every citizen should pay attention to this and put it into practice. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, February 40th).</p>
<h3>American Social Unrest, Wage Issues Stalemate</h3>
<p>(Zurich dispatch, 13th, sent by special correspondent) The US government is working hard to fix the cost of living during wartime, but the extra war expenses it has raised are now affecting various sectors of the US economy, and a major threat is felt. Coordination between the US government and labor unions is becoming increasingly difficult. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington, the leaders of the two major labor unions, American Federation of Labor President Green and Congress of Industrial Organizations President Murray, protested to Roosevelt against the ever-increasing cost of living, indicating a surge in public dissatisfaction. In fact, various labor groups in the United States have recently frequently issued demands for wage increases. The War Labor Board's regulations for increasing wages in the iron industry exceed the 15% wage standard of 1941, but Economic Adjustment Bureau Director Barnes questioned the War Labor Board whether this regulation should be revised.</p>
<p>Although the wages of American mine workers have been determined by the Labor Board as the highest, the mine workers' union still demands that the wages of 450,000 coal miners be increased by two yuan per day. The pit workers' union argues that the principle is not appropriate, so the principle of wage increase must be increased by at least 15%. Sixty-four thousand workers in Chicago's four largest canneries, where wages have already reached the highest amount, also demand an additional 5% increase in hourly wages. If the War Labor Board approves this wage increase, it would be tantamount to abandoning the aforementioned 15% policy. If the wages of cannery workers increase, food prices cannot but rise accordingly, which is dangerous for the overall price policy and cost-of-living policy. Green said that the 15% policy is too rigid and is not appropriate due to the continuous increase in prices. Therefore, Green believes that if the cost of living cannot be fixed, then wages cannot be fixed either. Labor Secretary Perkins pointed out that the price of agricultural products is the reason for the high cost of living.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the United States, wage disputes and the crisis of inflation are both unavoidable facts and are becoming seeds of bitterness. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, February 15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cultural Work in China: A Glimpse of Medical, Educational, and Facilities</h3>
<p>(Tokyo telephone) During the budget general meeting of your esteemed hospital on the 18th, Okabe Nagakage questioned: "What decisions have been made regarding cultural work to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere? I would like to hear the details regarding cultural policies, etc." Prime Minister Tojo replied: "We are now implementing various measures in the political, economic, and cultural sectors, and we are revealing a clear policy for future perfection." Regarding cultural work in China, Greater East Asia Minister Aoki said: "We are now implementing measures such as medical care and popularizing the Japanese language in China." A glimpse of the Japanese government's path for cultural work in China can be seen here. Its specific measures and plans are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The total budget related to cultural work, including the previously decided budget of 18 million yuan, totals far more than 28 million yuan, of which about 9 million yuan is for medical and epidemic prevention. From this, we can see the government's attention to medical care. The main epidemic prevention measures have already established epidemic prevention committees in the 12 regions of Central China and are continuing to promote them. Last autumn, there was a tiger epidemic in Guangzhou, but the committee made every effort to curb it. In addition to the four major epidemic prevention centers in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanjing, and Wuhu, a new Central China Epidemic Prevention Center is being newly established in Shanghai, making its content and appearance the best in the world. This is currently being planned. These epidemic prevention facilities will be gradually realized under the entire organization of the large-scale Charitable Society. The Charitable Society also established clinics in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Lushan, Jiujiang, Hankou, Wuhu, Wuxi, Suzhou, Jinhua, and other places, established hospitals, and actively served the common people.</p>
<p>The popularization of the Japanese language has now surpassed the stage of guidance and persuasion. Under the new face of Sino-Japanese co-existence and co-death, the entire China is now filled with a new scene of enthusiastic learning. In the future, the policy of establishing Japanese language schools in Central China will be: (1) establishing exemplary Japanese language schools; (2) evenly establishing Japanese language schools in various regions. We eagerly await its early realization.</p>
<p>The government is also establishing a specialized department in the East Asia Common Culture Academy starting in April and opening a North China Higher Industrial School in Beijing, in order to substantially improve educational institutions and advance simultaneously with the popularization of the Japanese language. In addition, the new Shanghai Medical University established by the Charitable Society is also gradually becoming concrete. Last autumn, the Lester Industrial School was renamed the East Asia Higher School and operated by the East Asia Common Culture Academy, which will surely contribute greatly to industrial education.

<h3>New Oil Rationing Plan to be Officially Implemented</h3>
<p>City Divided into Seven Jurisdictional Areas, Monthly Issuance of Oil Purchase Certificates</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai food oil industry wholesale office implemented oil rationing in the city, there have often been delays in deliveries and limited quantities, resulting in insufficient supply. Each distribution date has caused citizens to crowd and compete for purchases. Although the food oil wholesale office has worked to improve the distribution system to alleviate residents' suffering from oil shortages, it has still been difficult to achieve the expected satisfactory results. Recently, in order to completely reform, the food oil wholesale office has decided to follow the household rice rationing method and distribute oil based on the number of people per household.</p>
<p>Shanghai Divided into Seven Jurisdictional Areas</p>
<p>The distribution method divides all of Shanghai into (1) the Public Concession, (2) the French Concession, (3) Western Shanghai, (4) the Hongkou Naval Garrison Area, (5) Nanshi, (6) Northern Shanghai, and (7) Pudong, for a total of seven jurisdictional areas. The oil distribution procedures for the two concessions will be handled by the concession authorities, issuing oil purchase certificates once a month, following the rice purchase certificate method. Oil distribution in Western Shanghai, Nanshi, Northern Shanghai, and Pudong will still be handled by the food oil wholesale office.</p>
<p>Retail Oil Stores Designated in Each Area</p>
<p>The amount of oil distributed will depend entirely on the quantity of deliveries and stock on hand. Retail oil stores within the seven jurisdictional areas have also been designated, totaling 364 stores. The distribution of stores in each area is as follows: 65 in the French Concession, 104 in the Public Concession, 66 in Hongkou, 45 in Nanshi, 43 in Western Shanghai, 18 in Northern Shanghai, and 23 in Pudong.</p>
<p>Restaurants and Taverns Follow Previous Method</p>
<p>The quantity and date of each sale will be determined as needed, depending on the delivery situation. Organizations that cannot obtain household oil rations can apply separately. Restaurants and taverns will also continue to follow the previous method. It is expected that oil rationing will be promoted more smoothly in the future.</p>
<p>Estimated Population and Oil Quantity Figures</p>
<p>Excluding the three districts of Northern Shanghai, Nanshi, and Pudong, the approximate population and the estimated retail oil quantity are recorded below after re-examination:</p>
<h3>February Sugar Rationing Ready, Purchase Certificates Issued Within the Next Two Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has completed the distribution of February sugar to various retailers and has set aside the 20th and 21st of this month for the issuance of purchase certificates. It is reported that although today is a regular Sunday holiday, the office will still be open as usual to allow retailers to bring their application receipts to the office to exchange for them within the deadline and pay for them at the designated distribution sugar companies by the 23rd. Those who fail to exchange for purchase certificates within the deadline or who have already received purchase certificates but do not pay at the designated sugar companies within the deadline will be deemed to have automatically forfeited their rights and will not be allocated sugar. It is reported that the office has notified all retailers to follow these instructions and avoid any errors.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Bureau Holds Meeting, Five New Measures Submitted to the Ministry of Finance for Approval</h3>
<p>Allied Press, Shanghai: The Ministry of Finance's Income Tax Bureau is currently holding continuous meetings in Shanghai to study ways to expand income tax revenue. The new measures will be implemented after approval by the Ministry of Finance and include: (1) levying income tax on foreign firms; (2) forcing merchants to record transactions; (3) increasing income tax rates; (4) strictly preventing merchants from falsifying accounts and evading taxes; and (5) revising the basic system for collecting income tax. Officials hope that after the implementation of these new measures, this year's income tax revenue will increase at least twice compared to last year.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Companies Must Obtain Licenses to Operate, Issuance Starts March 1st, Approximately 20 Yuan per Quarter</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in this city, due to the depletion of gasoline, various taxi companies have closed down one after another, replaced by rickshaw companies, which have sprung up like mushrooms after rain and developed abnormally. The Municipal Council stipulates that all public rickshaw companies must obtain licenses to operate starting from March 1st of this year. The prescribed license fee is 20 yuan per quarter for premises of 500 square feet or less, and an additional 4 yuan per quarter for each additional 100 square feet or less. Each rickshaw company must apply for a license from the Council's Vehicle Affairs Office starting from the prescribed date; otherwise, they will not be allowed to operate within the boundaries.</p>
<h3>Charity Association Plans to Establish School for Displaced Children, Enrollment Set at 500, Officially Opens Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Relief Association, in order to promote education for displaced children, has consulted with the 7th District Baojia Association of the Navy Baojia District and agreed to jointly establish a school for displaced children. The location has been selected at the Ciyuan Shelter on Alabaster Road. The enrollment of displaced children is 500, of which 300 will be selected from various shelters, and 200 will be from poor families from all walks of life, who can freely register for free admission. Teachers are currently being hired, and classrooms are being arranged. It is hoped that the school will officially open next month to benefit displaced children.</p>
<h3>Gaussot Flew to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>French Ambassador Gaussot left Shanghai for Nanjing at 9:00 a.m. yesterday and arrived at 10:40 a.m. to inspect the new situation after China's entry into the war. It is reported that the French Ambassador has been in Shanghai for several weeks after coming from North China.</p>
<h3>French Concession Implements Universal Vaccination</h3>
<p>The French Concession Health Office pays great attention to public health for residents within the concession and implements universal smallpox vaccination. It is cooperating with the Baojia authorities to conduct door-to-door vaccination, dispatching doctors to Baojia offices in various districts to administer vaccinations. The Baojia chiefs will notify residents in their Baojia to bring all family members to the designated locations for vaccination on the scheduled dates, free of charge, but they must not evade, or they will be punished.</p>
<h3>Mr. Okuda, Section Chief, Returns to Shanghai from Japan, Discussing Economic Policies Towards China: Everything Must Align with Realistic Circumstances, and Detailed Handling of Matters is Entrusted to Local Authorities</h3>
<p>Our Shanghai correspondent from Domei News Agency reports: Mr. Okuda, the Economic Section Chief of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, has returned to Shanghai on Thursday after traveling to Tokyo to discuss future Japanese economic policies towards China with central authorities. The following day, he told reporters from Domei News Agency that since the National Government has joined the Greater East Asia War, Japan's policy towards China is to focus on enhancing China's combat capabilities and revitalizing its national economy. The Tokyo authorities, in implementing new policies towards China, are well aware that they should align with realistic circumstances, and the detailed handling of various matters should be decided by local authorities.</p>
<p>Merchants Should Participate in the Purchase and Sale of Goods</p>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of trade, procurement, and distribution agencies, no concrete plans have been finalized. However, signs indicate that future trade in Central China will be dominated by the Japanese, while trade between Central China, North China, and South China will be entrusted to Chinese merchants. Chinese merchants should participate in the purchase and sale of goods in China, so the current purchase and sale agencies must be reorganized to adapt to the new situation. Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Mr. Kishi stated in the Diet that Japan will procure goods in China at reasonable prices. The so-called reasonable price is neither too low nor too high, but a reasonable price that considers factors such as cost.</p>
<p>Maintaining Shanghai's Production, Promoting Heavy Industry</p>
<p>Speaking of increasing industrial production in Shanghai, he hopes to achieve this by increasing the purchase of raw materials. Although heavy industry is currently concentrated in Japan, efforts will also be made to promote heavy industry in China. Mr. Okuda denied that the textile industry would be transferred from Japan to China, saying that considering the current shortage of raw materials in Shanghai's yarn factories, which has reduced production by 70%, this is highly unlikely.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief Office to Open a Gruel Kitchen in Zhabei, Subject to Municipal Government Approval for a Scheduled Opening</h3>
<p>The municipal government-sponsored winter relief efforts for the 31st year have been launched in stages according to the established relief projects. The winter relief office, recognizing that there are more poor households in Zhabei than in Nanshi and Western Shanghai, has consulted with Mr. Li Xiamin, a representative of the Zhabei Charity Group, several times. As a result, it was decided to add a winter relief gruel kitchen in the Zhabei Charity Group on Nanxing Road, north of the New Zha Bridge, to expand relief efforts. The necessary start-up costs and staff salaries will be the responsibility of the Charity Group, while the winter relief office will be responsible for supplying rice and fuel, effectively making it a collaborative effort. The number of gruel recipients is tentatively set at 2,000. It is reported that once approved by the municipal government, the kitchen will open on a scheduled basis, which is indeed good news for the poor in Zhabei.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade Report for January</h3>
<p>Last month, the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade received a total of 65 fire alarms, including six false alarms made in good faith and three special alarms. The estimated value of property lost in fires within the Public Concession and special property tax areas was $8,254,050. One citizen died in a fire, four were injured, four were injured in special incidents, and five firefighters were injured while fighting fires. In addition, the fire brigade's ambulance was dispatched 171 times, transporting a total of 202 patients to various hospitals.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Regular Budget for This Year (Continued from the 17th)</h3>
<p>(1) When retailers apply to increase prices, the council will review their applications. If the prices requested by the merchants are deemed fair by the council, they will be approved. These prices will become the maximum retail prices and must not be exceeded.</p>
<p>(2) In certain circumstances, the council will set maximum retail prices on its own. The council issues the above two notices based on the provisions of Article 53 of the newly attached rules to the Land Regulations. This article authorizes the council to publish a list of items subject to price controls at any time. However, until the end of the year, at the request of the Japanese authorities, the council limited price controls to retail items only. Wholesale prices have not been controlled, except in a few cases where prices for cotton cloth, wool fabric, canned goods, leather goods, etc., were set in cooperation with manufacturers, wholesalers, and other related parties.</p>
<p>The work of calculating costs is extremely complex. In addition to setting prices for bread, flatbread, and other wheat products, the prices of approximately 6,000 kinds of daily necessities sold to the general public in large department stores have been successively evaluated. In addition, the prices of more than 1,000 kinds of daily necessities sold in other types of stores have also been set. There are also many types of price limits set for meat, fresh milk, and piece goods of wool fabric. By the end of the year, the total number of items with price limits approved by this section reached 10,786.</p>
<p>The council has two sections to implement price control work. One is the Cost Calculation Section, as mentioned above. The other is the Investigation and Enforcement of Price Limits Section. It is found that on November 18 and 24, and December 4, 1941, the council issued three notices stipulating the retail price limits for imported goods. At that time, in order to implement these price limits, an Enforcement of Price Limits Office was established in the Industrial and Social Affairs Department, supervised by the Enforcement of Price Limits Committee. Later, as the council's price control work increased, the scope of the Enforcement of Price Limits Office was expanded. In April of the previous year, the office was transferred to the Price Control Office and renamed the Investigation and Enforcement of Price Limits Section. By the end of the year, almost all retail prices were under control, and the work of the Enforcement of Price Limits Section suddenly became heavy. The section was divided into two parts, one for the Investigation Office and one for the Enforcement of Price Limits Office, so that each could be responsible for its own duties.</p>
<p>The work of the Investigation Office, as its name suggests, is to investigate whether stores have violated the price limit regulations. The staff includes one chief investigator, six inspectors, and seventy-one investigators. These personnel are currently continuing to conduct systematic investigations of stores within the concession. Any violation discovered will be reported to the Enforcement of Price Limits Office for review. The office employs five experienced lawyers to interview those who have violated the regulations. Anyone deemed to have violated the regulations will be notified by the office to come to the bureau to be interviewed by the lawyers and given the opportunity to present reasons why they should not be punished. If a violation is established, it will be transferred to the Enforcement of Price Limits Committee for review and determination of penalties.</p>
<p>Throughout the past year, the Investigation and Enforcement of Price Limits Section conducted a total of 55,115 investigations and received 396 letters from citizens reporting the inability to purchase price-controlled goods and other violations to the council for investigation. At the same time, the Enforcement of Price Limits Office summoned violators for interviews 7,738 times, of which 3,046 were punished.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth: There are many yarn factories in Shanghai, and cotton cloth is very important for the clothing of ordinary people in China. Therefore, the rise and fall of yarn and cloth prices, like other bulk commodities such as rice, etc., is enough to affect the general price level in Shanghai. Speculative trading of yarn and cloth was quite active last year. In early November, the council announced a ban on the trading of Shuangma brand cotton yarn, which was the first step in cracking down on yarn and cloth speculation. At the end of the same month, the price limits for various brands of yarn and cloth were announced. At the same time, a registration of yarn and cloth inventory was conducted, and it was stipulated that all new goods should be registered with the council at any time. Since the registration of yarn and cloth is important, the council has specially added an office to handle it.</p>
<p>Readers' Forum</p>
<h3>A Few Hopes for Suppressing Prices</h3>
<p>— Yuqi</p>
<p>Since the Lunar New Year, prices have been rising sharply, causing great concern for the salaried class. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. Therefore, I would like to express a few hopes to the authorities.</p>
<p>(1) Implement a "Market Cleaning Movement": The excuse for soaring prices is that the source of supply is cut off, and inventories are dwindling. Therefore, demand exceeds supply, and prices have to rise. However, according to various newspapers, since the opening of the customs, the supply of various goods has become normal, and inventories are also abundant. There is no shortage in the short term. Obviously, the soaring prices are all due to speculation, the so-called black market trading. If there is black market trading, there must be real goods. Otherwise, how can there be so many merchants doing that kind of empty trading? However, on the surface, they all pretend to be acting, falsely claiming that hundreds of goods are in short supply, prompting prices to rise, which is even more obvious. It is not really that the source of supply is not smooth, but actually due to the hoarding of unscrupulous merchants and the speculation of merchants.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the authorities can immediately implement a "Market Cleaning Movement." Force open warehouses, strictly search storage areas, and strictly inspect stores, even residences should be inspected. Then, the general hoarders will have nowhere to hide. Once unregistered private goods are found, they should be confiscated and sold at flat prices, because "the wool comes from the sheep." If a fine is imposed, then general unscrupulous merchants will try every means to raise prices afterwards, which is indirectly equivalent to punishing ordinary people. In recent times, those who hoard goods and speculate to raise prices and make profits have regarded fines as insignificant, and this is also the reason why.</p>
<p>(2) Make Every Effort to Unblock Sources: On the one hand, implement a "Market Cleaning Movement," which is the so-called symptomatic treatment, so that hoarded goods are released. On the other hand, if more effort is put into unblocking sources, which is the fundamental cure, it can be even more effective. Because once the saturation point of supply exceeding demand is reached, and then the balance of supply and demand is achieved, then unscrupulous merchants can no longer use the excuse of "short supply," and the act of raising prices cannot be sustained. Then the decline in prices can also be like quicksilver, proportional to the rise in prices.</p>
<p>(3) Strictly Enforce Price Limits: It is heard that the economic police of the concession authorities have completed their training. It is hoped that after that, the enforcement of the newly announced price limits can be absolutely strict. Once fraud and other circumstances are discovered, strict investigations will be conducted without leniency, so as to warn others against following suit. Perhaps people's livelihood can gradually become stable.</p>
<p>(4) Compulsorily Implement Flat Sales: For all the goods that have been registered with the concession authorities, the authorities should select 90% of the most common and practical ones and implement compulsory flat sales: just like the old days when the big flat sales were implemented, to solve the immediate crisis. Then, gradually improve it.</p>
<p>Among the above four points, the first point is particularly important. This move can not only investigate the population, but also stabilize people's livelihood, which is truly killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<h3>Residence Certificates in the French Concession Must Be Hung in Obvious Places for Random Inspections</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the French Concession have completed the household registration survey of residents in the concession, and residence certificates have also been completely issued. Now, in order to prevent petty criminals from hiding in the concession and to effectively maintain local security, police officers are dispatched to various districts from time to time to conduct random household registration inspections according to the Baojia system. Therefore, it is specifically ordered that each head of household must hang the residence certificate in an obvious place for random inspections at any time. Otherwise, they will be punished according to the regulations.</p>
<h3>China and Japan Will Cooperate to Establish an Economic Investigation Agency, Which May Be Established Next Month</h3>
<p>There is still no national economic investigation agency, so we know nothing about the economic situation, such as the prosperity and decline of industry and commerce in various places, and the production and reserves of various minerals. According to news from this city, recently the Japanese side has consulted with our country's authorities and plans to establish a complete economic investigation agency in cooperation with China and Japan. The construction departments of various provinces, cities, and counties will jointly cooperate to carry out various economic investigations. It is heard that this agency may be announced next month.</p>

<h3>St. John's University Fires British and American Faculty</h3>
<p>St. John's University in Shanghai, located on Fanhuangdu Road, was founded by the American Church and has been in operation for more than 70 years. Most of the faculty and staff hired on weekdays are of British or American nationality. After the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9 of this year, various institutions have dismissed British and American employees. Since the semester is about to end, the school allowed them to continue in their positions. Starting from the beginning of this semester on the 18th of this month, British and American faculty and staff have been dismissed. However, British and American students are temporarily admitted. According to Bishop Yu of the school, this move aims to support the National Government's will to participate in the war and strive to promote the victory of the war.</p>

<p>Since the republication of Shen Bao Monthly, subscriptions have been very enthusiastic. The republished issue sold out soon after publication. The second issue has now been published, and the content is very rich. There are eight articles discussing current affairs issues, namely "The Opposition Between Britain and the United States and Its Essentials," "The Question of the Recovery of the Concessions," "The Belligerent Countries Preparing for Decisive Battle," "The General Situation of Burma's Nationalities and Their Movements," "Hawaii, the Heart of the Pacific," "The Indian Princes," etc. The special feature of this issue discusses China's economic issues after participating in the war, with a total of six articles, all of which are excellent works and discuss the issue in detail. In addition, the wartime geographical knowledge introduces the situation of the islands surrounding Australia. An article on Japanese literature in China introduces the situation of Japanese literature in China after the war. There are also four articles on Yinhai Guangwen, three articles on Gu Yi Congtan, and one translated novel. There are also ten current affairs drawings. The topics are too numerous to mention, and the interest is very strong. Although the number of copies in this issue is more than double that of the republished issue, due to the crowding of buyers, it is feared that it will still be too late to purchase. I hope that all sectors will subscribe as early as possible.</p>
<h3>Shanghai, Suzhou, and Other "Cleaned-Up Areas" to Form Flour Rationing Cooperatives, Flour Production of Various Factories to Be Rationed Directly at Fixed Prices</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of flour rationing in Central China, the relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities have been studying countermeasures since last winter and preparing to organize a flour rationing cooperative. According to the Commercial News Agency's investigation, the cooperative is nearing completion after preparation by both China and Japan. On the 15th of this month, Chinese and Japanese representatives from flour mills and flour operators in Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other nearby areas were convened in Wu to hold a meeting. As a result, it was unanimously decided to formally establish the "Flour Rationing Cooperative for Cleaned-Up Areas" in the shortest possible time. After the establishment of the cooperative, the flour produced by various flour mills will be directly rationed by the cooperative at official prices to supply the people's food. At the same time, the black market for flour will also be resolutely suppressed.</p>
<p>Our correspondent from Domei News Agency reports that all small-scale flour mills in Central China will soon be under the unified management of the Central China Flour Mill Federation in order to accelerate the production of flour and bran and implement satisfactory distribution. The federation has sent personnel to Wuxi and other places in the interior to investigate the actual situation of flour and bran production.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate General Urges Japanese Merchants in Hongkou to Change Price Markings to Central Reserve Vouchers, Employees' Salaries to Be Paid Half in Reserve Vouchers</h3>
<p>Our correspondent from Domei News Agency reports that the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in order to further promote the circulation of Central Reserve Vouchers, has recently launched a movement to make retail in Shanghai generally denominated in Central Reserve Vouchers, with particular emphasis on Hongkou, where the Japanese community is concentrated. The Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai is backing this movement and urging Japanese restaurants and hotels to use Central Reserve Vouchers for price markings and charges to replace military scrip. It is also heard that half of the salaries of all employees of Japanese commercial firms will be paid in Central Reserve Vouchers. Currently, 30% of the salaries of employees of various Japanese national policy companies are paid in Central Reserve Vouchers.</p>

<h3>Stepping Up Price Controls, Reorganizing the Structures of Various Trade Associations, More Than 300 Units Approved for Establishment to Assist the Authorities in Implementing Economic Policies</h3>
<p>In the past, the Shanghai trade associations had many obstacles to commercial development due to the changing environment and the lack of leadership. After the reorganization by the social movement authorities, the structures gradually expanded. After the municipal chamber of commerce was restored, the Shanghai Municipal Council successively established a trade association section, and the situation greatly changed. The organizational structure of the associations was also expanded, and at the same time, members of the trade were widely solicited to join the associations. According to an investigation by the Shanghai Social News Agency, as of recently, there are more than 300 units of trade associations that have been formally approved by the social movement authorities and registered with the Shanghai Municipal Council trade association section. Therefore, the registered associations tend to be unified in structure.</p>
<p>Forty Units Have Been Dissolved</p>
<p>It is found that there were originally 368 units of trade associations in Shanghai, of which only 149 were registered with the authorities. Currently, about 40 units of trade associations have been dissolved, namely the gasoline industry, automobile industry, truck industry, shipping industry, navigation industry, coal transportation industry, wireless advertising industry, oil lamp industry, military uniform industry, pawnshop redemption industry, and servant introduction industry. Therefore, there are only more than 320 associations remaining. Now, due to the control of the authorities, almost all of them have registered with the competent authorities and been approved for establishment, so as to assist the authorities in implementing economic policies.</p>
<p>Assisting in Price Limits and Distribution of Goods</p>
<p>As for the trade association section established by the Shanghai Municipal Council, its scope of work has been expanding since its establishment. The original motivation for the establishment of the section was to contact various trade associations in the city to cooperate in controlling prices and distributing goods. In addition to trying to communicate the relationship between the authorities and various industries, if difficulties occur in various industries, it will accept the good faith applications of the trade associations, review them, and further guide the activities of the industries, so that officials and businessmen can seek solutions. In terms of price control, the section will seek a reasonable price level under the principle of considering both commerce and people's livelihood. In terms of steps, it will first adjust the manufacturing cost of goods, and then gradually control the separate retail prices through wholesale.</p>
<h3>The Prohibition of Spitting Anywhere to Be Enforced Long-Term, The Second Week of Promotion Concluded Successfully Yesterday</h3>
<p>The second week of the anti-spitting campaign launched by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, which began on the 14th of this month, concluded successfully yesterday (20th). Information about the campaign was obtained from the Health Department authorities as follows:</p>
<p>The Police Are Doing Their Best to Assist in the Execution of Fines</p>
<p>The second week of the anti-spitting campaign in the Public Concession has been underway for a week. During this period, with the help of the tenth police station, the publicity work has been able to proceed smoothly, and the original order to fine violators 5 yuan has been effectively enforced. Therefore, the Health Department is very grateful for the assistance of the police. The general public, through the authorities' sincere advice and extensive publicity, has been able to deeply understand the trial of spitting anywhere, and has been able to be vigilant and reform their stubborn habits.</p>
<p>Fines Will Be Used for Public Health Work</p>
<p>However, residents who are fined on Thursdays do not care about this. It is said that these fines will be fully used for public health work. The prohibition of spitting anywhere will be enforced long-term. The regulation of fining 5 yuan each time will continue to be effective. Therefore, the authorities sincerely hope that residents will pay attention to avoid unnecessary losses. At the same time, it is heard that the Health Department plans to expand the scope of public health publicity in the future, so that every resident of Shanghai can take care of the health of the public and make Shanghai a world-famous clean area.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Qingxiang Branch Promotes Second Phase of Qingxiang Campaign: Second Committee Meeting Held Yesterday, with Director Chen Personally Present to Preside</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Qingxiang Committee, considering that the first phase of the first Qingxiang campaign is nearing completion and the second phase of the first Qingxiang campaign is about to begin, held its second committee meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 20th) in the conference room of the branch to review the implementation of past work and make improvements for the future. More than 20 people attended, including Director Chen, Office Director Xu, various committee members, heads of offices and departments, and district commissioners.</p>
<p>First Qingxiang Campaign Nears Completion</p>
<p>Chairman Chen delivered an on-the-spot report, stating that the first phase of the first Qingxiang campaign in the city is nearing completion, and the second phase of the first campaign is also about to begin. To review the past and improve the future, he hoped that everyone would express their opinions as much as possible for reference. In his observation, while there were many advantages in the past Qingxiang campaigns, shortcomings could not be ignored. The advantages should be promoted, and the shortcomings should be corrected. As for the organizational structure, although it has been able to achieve unification, the laws and regulations are not yet complete and specific. There should be close contact between the Qingxiang Branch and the municipal government to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The advancement of military affairs and politics should also be in sync. Other tasks, such as material management, Baojia organization, and enforcement of blockades, require concerted efforts to achieve significant results. He hoped that all responsible personnel would earnestly promote the campaigns.</p>
<p>Field Tax Donations Discussed</p>
<p>Office Director Xu reported on the promotion of self-defense, self-government, education, transportation construction, and the preparations for the second phase of the Qingxiang campaign. Then, discussions began on how to manage the rice for the Qingxiang teams, how to handle factories in the Qingxiang areas, how to handle relief efforts in the Qingxiang areas, compensation for those who died on duty, plans to establish reformatories and vocational training centers for vagrants, selecting outstanding renovators, how to levy field taxes in the 32nd year, and how to adjust donations in the Qingxiang areas to reduce the burden on the people. More than ten proposals were thoroughly discussed and successfully passed. The meeting was adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Qingxiang Dynamics Broadcast Tonight</p>
<p>The Propaganda Office of the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch will hold a broadcast lecture on "Recent Developments in Shanghai's Qingxiang Campaign" from 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM tonight (the 21st) through the Shanghai Broadcasting Station. It will provide a summary report on major events in the Shanghai Qingxiang campaign and point out its significance, so that all sectors can understand the current situation of the Shanghai Qingxiang campaign.</p>
<p>Investigation of Private Schools</p>
<p>In order to understand the nature and general situation of the supplementary education institutions in the Qingxiang areas, the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch has formulated a survey form and instructed all special district offices to fill it out and report in detail. According to the report from the Fengxian Special District Office, there are eleven private schools in the district's eight townships, including Dunhe Township, with a total of 216 male and female students. There are no other formal supplementary schools.</p>
<h3>Punishment for Short Weights Used by Beef Vendors</h3>
<p>Qie Chongbo (transliteration), a beef vendor at stall number 35 of the Seymour Road market, was found to be using inaccurate scales, shorting approximately half a pound for every ten pounds. After being discovered by the Health Department of the Public Works Department, he was prosecuted in the Special District Court and fined 200 yuan on the 19th of this month, and the scales were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Housing Disputes Decrease in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to a reporter's statement from those managing housing subletting affairs in western Shanghai, there have been many housing disputes in the western district of Shanghai. Recently, the authorities have actively adjusted the organization of the management office, revised the regulations, accepted residents' complaints about various disputes, and mediated them. As a result, housing disputes have gradually decreased, and landlords and tenants have generally been able to live in peace.</p>
<h3>Closing of the Chief of the Embassy Office Conference: Five Representatives Express Their Thoughts</h3>
<p>The first conference of chiefs of the judicial affairs departments under the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, held in Shanghai on the 18th and 19th since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, has successfully concluded. After this meeting, the police administration policy for Central and Southern China has been established to adapt to the new situation after the National Government's entry into the war, with the aim of achieving the ideal. The police chiefs of the consulates in Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangdong expressed their thoughts after the meeting on the 19th as follows:</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chief Shirakami</h3>
<p>Due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War last year, work in various areas was busy, so the annual meeting of chiefs in Central and Southern China could not be held. This time, the meeting was held at a critical time, so many important proposals were put forward. Moreover, it was the first meeting after the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry. All attendees discussed fervently. Regarding the content of the meeting, it cannot be disclosed in detail. All policies have been instructed by the superiors and will be implemented successively by the police departments.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Chief Shibosawa</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the National Government's entry into the war, everything has changed. We have the responsibility to protect and inspect Japanese residents. In our work, we feel that there are many difficult problems to handle. After this meeting, we have received detailed instructions from the province, which we can follow. We will use this as a basis and consider it carefully. In the future, no matter what problems arise, we believe that we will be able to solve them for the Japanese residents.</p>
<h3>Hankou Chief Kawashima</h3>
<p>After this meeting, we fully understand the new situation after the National Government's entry into the war. The Greater East Asia Ministry police officers serving in China are determined to fulfill their important mission. The police mission is not only limited to maintaining law and order as in the past. We must have the determination to abandon selfishness and serve the public in all aspects. The security in Hankou has been excellent recently. In terms of economic control, all purchasing and distribution agencies have been fully established, based on Sino-Japanese cooperation as a prerequisite. It is expected that the administration will be smooth.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Chief Suzuki</h3>
<p>Since the occupation of Hong Kong, Guangdong has taken on a new look. Especially after the National Government's entry into the war, Guangdong has become an important town in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Our responsibility is even greater. During the meeting, I reported on the uniqueness of Guangdong. The relationship between Guangdong and Hong Kong is very deep. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Guangdong has had a significant impact on the Battle of Hong Kong. Therefore, we are very concerned about the uniqueness of Guangdong. I believe that at this great time, we must have a firm determination.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Chief Kitagawa</h3>
<p>This meeting provided clear guidance on police policy and was very rewarding. The meeting has ended, and I will return to my post immediately. In the future, I will devote myself to supervising my subordinates to strengthen the police mission. For the Japanese residents in my jurisdiction, I will thoroughly implement the police spirit and work hard in my position. This time, I was able to meet with old colleagues and officials and understand the actual situation in various places, which can be used as a reference.

<h3>Wang Jinxiu Zhai Murder Case: Jin Fugen Sentenced to Death: Appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court After Disagreeing with the Initial Trial: Still Sentenced to Death, Plans to File a Third Trial Appeal</h3>
<p>On the night of June 26th of last year, the Wang Jinxiu Zhai jewelry store at 521 Xiafei Road was broken into by former partner Tang Wenxiang, who colluded with Jin Fugen, the owner of the Changxing Flower Shop at 519 next door, and apprentice Wang Ruigen. They climbed over the wall into the kiosk, intending to kill the store owner, Wang Weiyuan. Fortunately, Wang had left Shanghai for Suzhou that day, and escaped the disaster. They killed Wang's five-year-old adopted son, Wang Mian, and injured Wang's cousin, Qu Huide. Then, they pried open the drawer and stole 300 yuan in new currency. After the incident, the court Lao arrested the three criminals, Tang, Jin, and Wang, and the suspect, Wang Weiyuan's stepmother, Wang Yangshi, and her lover, Gao Sheting, one after another. After investigation, because Wang Yangshi and Gao Shouting had little to do with the case, they were released first. The three criminals, Tang Wenxiang, Jin Fugen, and Wang Ruigen, were sent to the Special District Court No. 2 to be prosecuted for robbery and murder. Tang Wenxiang died in custody due to illness. The first trial sentenced Jin Fugen to death for robbery and murder, and deprived him of his civil rights for life. Wang Ruigen was sentenced to three years in prison for robbery. Tang Wenxiang's case was not accepted. The heir of Wang Wenxiang accepted the judgment. Jin Fugen, disagreeing with the judgment, appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After repeated court hearings and witness testimonies, the judgment was issued yesterday. The original judgment was revoked. Jin Fugen was sentenced to one year in prison for robbery, and sentenced to death for joint murder, and deprived of civil rights for life, to be carried out together with the death penalty and deprivation of civil rights for life. It is reported that the criminal Jin is still not convinced by the appeal judgment and is preparing to file a third trial appeal with the Supreme Court.</p>

<h3>Annual Report of the Housing Rent Conciliation Committee: 134 Issues Handled, Striving to Achieve Agreement Between Both Parties in Each Dispute</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department established the Housing Rent Conciliation Committee in December of the year before last to address the housing shortage and the rent issues arising from the depreciation of currency value. In conjunction with the Bureau of Legal Affairs, it has been resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. By the end of last year, the committee had handled 134 issues, including:</p>
<p>66 cases filed by tenants, 68 cases filed by landlords. The committee held 114 meetings and mediated with a cautious attitude. The conciliation status accepted by the committee last year was: 44 cases were resolved through concessions from both sides, 17 cases were decided by the committee, 30 cases were returned because they were not within the jurisdiction, 24 cases were rejected, 16 cases were filed in court, and 3 cases are currently under review, totaling 134 cases.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's Housing Rent Conciliation Committee made the following statement regarding the rules for mediating rent lending:</p>
<p>(1) The movement to increase or decrease rent began in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. By the 26th year, rents gradually increased. The current rent valuation is still based on the 26th year. According to a survey, due to unfair tax burdens, a special committee decided to increase it by 20%.</p>
<p>(1) At that time, some people thought that this measure was not very fair in terms of valuation, and even before the incident, in the 26th year, rents were already unfair due to various reasons. Therefore, the Public Works Department conducted a new valuation of land and buildings on a certain basis. This measure does not apply to the purpose of taxation. In the actual situation in August of the 31st year, it can also be seen from the perspective of the relative rental price of housing.</p>
<p>(1) This valuation should not be higher than the original valuation, and can be called fair. When the conciliation committee decides on the amount of rent that forms the basis for adjusting rent, it has considered comparing the same type of housing in the same area. Each dispute is mediated according to its actual situation, and it is resolved only after both parties agree.</p>
<h3>Special Issue on Various Places in Nanyang, Part Three: The Philippines, Past and Present (3)</h3>
<p>— Voters</p>
<p>The shortage of transportation vessels and the sluggish trade between the United States and the Philippines have profoundly affected peaceful industries, especially the sugar industry, which accounts for the bulk of the Philippines' exports. In 1941, the quantitative export of sugar to the United States was 950,000 tons, of which 100,000 tons were stockpiled due to insufficient shipping space, causing a severe blow to the Philippine sugar industry. However, in reality, it was not just the sugar industry. For example, the iron ore and timber industries, which have always been trade-centered on exports to Japan, were shut down to cut off exports to Japan, and the timber industry was shut down, adding a large unemployed population. In November 1941, the number of unemployed in the Philippines reached 400,000. (According to the World Panic — in 1932, the total number of unemployed in the Philippines was 479,063, including 265,609 agricultural operators and 213,454 industrial workers.)</p>
<p>Any change in trade with the United States will immediately affect the Philippine economy. Clarifying the trade between the United States and the Philippines in recent years can make this clear. This fully points out the Philippines' dependence on the United States. A change in this relationship is tantamount to a fatal blow to the Philippines:</p>
<p>Philippines-US Trade (Unit: Thousands of Pesos)</p>
<p>From this reality of US-Philippine trade, it can be seen how dangerous the consequences of a one-day severance will be. In particular, the main products of the Philippines, such as sugar, coconut, coconut oil, tobacco, and hemp, are mostly for export to the United States, and cannot be expected to be digested in the domestic market. After trade is difficult to sever, the phenomena of overproduction and stagnant goods will cause economic panic. On the other hand, the severance of consumer goods and other inputs, followed by a shortage of some commodities, will inevitably lead to a phenomenon of skyrocketing prices. The main materials imported by the United States into the Philippines are meat and dairy products, cigarettes, cotton products, automobiles, gasoline, steel products, mining machinery, and electrical appliances, etc. In addition, food is even more important. The Philippines produces about 14 million stones of rice, and corn also has a considerable output. However, it is not enough to supply the needs of 16 million people, and a large amount of rice and wheat must be imported from the United States and Vietnam every year. In addition, fruits and vegetables are imported to the tune of 7 million pesos annually, processed fish products 4 million pesos, wheat flour 10 million pesos, processed meat products 3 million pesos, coffee and cocoa 3.5 million pesos, for a total of 27.5 million pesos in food imports. Some of these foods were originally imported from Europe, Japan, and Australia, but they have been interrupted by the European War, the blockade of Japan, and the lack of ships, and have to rely entirely on the United States for supply. The severance of materials such as automobiles will only strike the 20,000 to 30,000 wealthy classes in the Philippines, but the strike of the food problem is keenly felt by more than 15 million Filipinos. Now the US forces have completely withdrawn from the Philippines, leaving a huge gap that urgently needs to be filled by the people of East Asia themselves!</p>
<p>The Economic Structure of the Philippines Before the War</p>
<p>Under the planned management of the Seven Righteous Capital of the American Empire, the economic structure of the Philippines presents the characteristics of a modern colonial economy, becoming an independent market for American investment commodities and one of the sources of raw materials and labor needed by the United States. The economic structure fully expresses its dependence on the United States. Therefore, although the Philippines has always boasted of being the most civilized country in the European and American colonies of Nanyang and expected to build a republican federation independent in July 1946, regardless of politics, the colonial nature of the economy is obviously not easy to get rid of. Therefore, it has established state-owned companies centered on the National Development Company, promoted national economic guarantee movements in an attempt to realize industrialization, promoted the autonomy of the retail industry in commerce, and established local development bureaus to promote the construction of modern rural movements. All of these Philippine economic autonomy and rationalization movements cannot naturally be achieved in a short period of time, and the war has also buried all these plans and undertakings.</p>
<p>The unsoundness of the Philippine economy is the result of the US imperialist policy towards the Philippines. Although the United States is the advocate of the open door and equal opportunity in East Asia, in its colony of the Philippines, it has adopted the opposite principle of closed doors and unequal opportunities, completely monopolizing trade, currency, and investment capital. This is the biggest reason for the uneven development of the Philippine economy—its weakness in terms of durability in the face of changes in the economic environment. This is not just a theory, but there are many concrete facts to prove it:</p>
<p>(1) The Philippine economy is based on agriculture. The lifeline of the Philippine economy is exclusively on export trade to the United States. This export trade is mainly and most heavily concentrated on agricultural products such as sugar. Therefore, its basic industry cannot but be agriculture.</p>
<p>Although the influence of the United States on the Philippines is extremely modern in terms of politics and culture, modern industries such as heavy industry and the chemical industry are completely lacking, and its economy presents the characteristics of a colonial economy. In terms of agricultural products, raw materials and semi-finished products are exported from primary industries such as forestry, fisheries, and mining, while the United States supplies finished products and some semi-finished products to the Philippines. The most important exports are agricultural products such as sugar, coconut, hemp, and tobacco.</p>
<p>(2) The commercialization of agricultural exports. Due to the above characteristics, the scale of Philippine agriculture and its export commodity status can be seen from the following table: (1940 figures)</p>
<p>As can be seen from the above table, the important agricultural products other than rice and corn are completely export commodities. For example, the harvest price of sugarcane is 113 million pesos, and the value of exporting it as sugar is 100 million pesos, which shows that domestic sales are extremely small. Coconut, tobacco, Manila hemp, etc. also have the same tendency. On the one hand, the main food grains, such as rice, the harvest volume is insufficient for domestic demand, and every year it relies on imports from abroad. However, during the Spanish-American War in 1897, it was one of the important exports of the Philippines. Since the American rule, it has been transformed into imported goods. In 1912, the import amount was 26 million pesos, reaching 836 million tons in 1939! The import amount of food such as rice and wheat flour accounted for 20% of the total imports, presenting the contradictory phenomenon that an agricultural country cannot be self-sufficient in food.</p>
<p>(3) The impact of the US trade currency policy on the Philippines. Industries such as sugar, coconut, tobacco, and hemp were already prosperous industries before the United States occupied the Philippines, that is, under Spanish rule. US imperialism's policy towards the Philippines has further implemented tariff preferences for these products (completely tax-free since 1913), purchased them in large quantities, and at the same time promoted high-priced US goods to the Philippines. As a result, it is very profitable to plant these crops and sell them to the United States, which invisibly encourages planting; on the other hand, other crops are gradually ignored because there is no profit to be made or little profit to be made. On the one hand, agriculture that exports to the United States, such as sugar, coconut, hemp, and tobacco, has developed abnormally even though it has little to do with the country, on the other hand, the population is increasing year by year, while food production is decreasing day by day.</p>
<p>(4) The proportion of the four major industries. The position of the above four major industries in the Philippine economy is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Sugar industry: Philippine sugar accounts for 60% of exports, and the total investment in cultivation and production is US$265.75 million (US$1 is equivalent to 2 pesos). The livelihoods of about 2.5 million Philippine people are directly and indirectly maintained by the sugar industry. Most of the Philippine government's income is the tax on the sugar industry. 40% of the income of the state-owned Manila Railway Company is sugar freight.</p>
<p>(B) Coconut industry: It accounts for 17% of exports, with a capital of US$220 million, and about 4 million islanders directly rely on it for a living.</p>
<p>(C) Hemp industry: The product accounts for 13% of exports, and the investment in production and improvement costs is US$185 million. About 2.5 million people rely on it for food and clothing.</p>
<p>(D) Tobacco industry: It accounts for 4% of export trade, with an investment of 21 million US dollars in cultivation land and improvement costs. About 500,000 islanders rely on it for a living.</p>
<p>It can be seen that 8 million people, that is, more than half of the total population, directly and indirectly rely on these four export industries for a living. In this way, the United States can smoothly implement its policy of dominance over the Philippines. But in the Philippines itself, this uneven economic development can be said to be a national tragedy.</p>

<h3>Puffer Fish Ban Campaign: China Film Drama Association Compiles Picture Strips for Promotion</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department has completely banned the sale of puffer fish because citizens often suffer from poisoning due to greed for puffer fish, and plans to promote the puffer fish ban campaign to raise awareness among the general public. However, in view of the fact that many citizens are still obsessed, in order to promote publicity, it has commissioned the Shenhua Film Drama Association in the city to compile film scripts, and will use the publicity method of film dramas to achieve results. It is heard that the Health Department presented two puffer fish to the association the day before yesterday so that photos could be taken for scriptwriters to refer to.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Guangzhao Public Hall</h3>
<p>The Guangzhao Public Hall in this port is organized by fellow villagers of the Guangzhao two prefectures in Guangdong Province who are traveling in Shanghai. It has a long history and has made outstanding achievements in running charity and education projects. After the incident, Mr. Wen Qinpu succeeded as chairman and handled the resettlement of refugees, which was not without benefit. Although Mr. Wen is now in power in the central government, he still strives for the affairs of the association. In difficult times, the organization of various undertakings has never been abandoned for a day. In recent years, with financial changes and the value of goods changing, the association has been able to settle its debts in a timely manner. The income and expenditure accounts over the years are printed in the creditworthiness record, which is well-organized. During the incident, many of the public properties were requisitioned by friendly agencies or confiscated as enemy properties, such as 450 mu of land in the New Mountain Villa in Dachang, 116 mu of land in the Old Mountain Villa in Chedaigiao, the entire school building of the Guangzhao Public School in Yokohama Bridge, and dozens of houses in Fudeli on North Sichuan Road, which have been recovered through negotiations. Other public properties of fellow villagers, such as the Guangzhao Hospital and the Yuanji Shantang, have also been returned to their original owners, and a great deal has been preserved. All of this was obtained by Mr. Wen through negotiations with friendly nations. In terms of educational undertakings, the Guangzhao Girls' School under its jurisdiction has never stopped singing and chanting. The Guangzhao Yixue School also resumed classes this spring. It is not easy to maintain such a state in the current environment. The public hall has a total of 23 directors, including old directors such as Guo Shun, Lao Jingxiu, Huang Hongjun, Zhang Rongpu, Wu Queting, and new directors such as Liang Haishou, Cheng Jinxiu, Li Shaoxuan, and Chen Ripeng, all of whom are well-known figures in the Guangdong community.</p>

The referee is Shen Pengchun, and the linesmen are Fadafu. Hailes. Tung Wah's lineup was announced yesterday by Jia Youliang. Due to the absence of forwards Yuan Kuntian and Wu Binghao, Liang Shutang has been moved forward to left inside forward, and the vacant left wing position will be filled by Xi Sheng. There are no other changes. When the two teams met in the first round, Tung Wah drew 0-0 in the first half, but then lost five goals in the second half, resulting in their first defeat.

<h3>Promoting Contributions to the National Government's Finances: The Future Task of the National Policy Company</h3>
<p>After the National Government joined the war, the task of the Sino-Japanese joint venture National Policy Company was to increase major resources to assist the National Government financially. Regarding this issue, President Kodama and Vice President Hirazawa of the Central China Revitalization Corporation consulted with the authorities of various related companies to formulate concrete plans, expand the organization of companies affiliated with the Central China Revitalization Corporation, and strengthen their financial and personnel ties. According to the company, before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the business policy of the National Policy Company was to focus on restoring industries destroyed by the war. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, its business policy had to be reformed, especially after the National Government joined the war, which increased the mission of the National Policy Company. Financial contributions to the National Government have become an absolute necessity. The targets are the following three points: (1) Paying interest on the National Government's shares; (2) Levying taxes on the National Policy Company; (3) Indirectly assisting the National Government by increasing production methods. Regarding this matter, all parties have reviewed it, and the contents are roughly as follows: The payment of interest on the National Government's shares is being prepared by each company, and some companies have already paid in full. Regarding the interest payable to the National Government, some companies have been established due to special circumstances and have not yet paid, but all of them have been completely settled and used as public reserves. The total amount of interest from the thirteen companies is quite large. Once this amount is returned to the National Government, the National Government's finances will inevitably be strengthened. From this point of view, the National Policy Company's contribution to the National Government's finances is significant. (Continental News)</p>

<h3>Implementation of Wartime Economic Policy Outline is More Important Than Principles</h3>
<p>The Wartime Economic Policy Outline, which was recently decided by the National Economic Conference and officially promulgated by the National Government on the 14th of this month, has been published in various newspapers and is already well known to readers. In summary, its contents are as follows: (1) Regarding increasing production, it is nothing more than the development of agriculture, minerals, military and civilian industries, and the guarantee of legitimate income for agricultural and industrial producers; (2) Regarding regulating prices, it is nothing more than improving transportation and distribution, reducing intermediate classes, cracking down on speculation and hoarding, and maintaining reasonable ratios between various prices; (3) Regarding saving consumers, it is nothing more than encouraging the manufacture of substitutes, restricting the production of luxury goods, cracking down on unnecessary consumption, and implementing fixed quota distribution; (4) Regarding stabilizing currency value and regulating finance, it is nothing more than strengthening financial institutions, encouraging people to save, promoting industrial lending, advocating the internal transfer of funds, and fundamentally coordinating currency value stabilization with increased productivity; (5) Regarding reforming economic institutions, it is nothing more than adjusting, reorganizing, and uniting the various stages of various industrial sectors, and implementing autonomous control or group management of healthy and major industries. Reading this in detail, it is not only the key to wartime economy, but also the economic policies for establishing a country are all prepared here.</p>
<p>The strategy of a country and a government is often swayed by its political background. Therefore, benevolence and wisdom are seen alternately, and each person differs in their views and judgments according to their different perspectives and positions. This outline is truly a summary and concise, without a single word mentioning politics. Regardless of which party, which faction, South, North, East, or West, I am afraid that no one would not regard this policy as a crucial plan for China.</p>
<p>However, it is easy to set principles, but difficult to make plans; it is easy to write an outline, but difficult to formulate details. It is even easier to make plans as an outline, but it is even more difficult to implement them. I have heard that the government has ordered relevant departments to properly formulate measures and implement them effectively. It can be seen that the importance of this matter lies not in empty talk, but in implementation. As for the difficulties in implementation, I am afraid there are more than just a few. If difficulties are not overcome, success will be difficult to achieve. Whether difficulties can be overcome depends on whether the government is working hard, whether all parties are sincere, and on the cooperation of officials and people, and the design of experts in various industries. Only in this way will the outline not become a tool for decoration.</p>
<h3>Rising Prices of Industrial Raw Materials: Urgent Need to Plan Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Recently, the general price level in the Shanghai area has risen about twice as high as before the Lunar New Year. This phenomenon is also very evident in various industrial raw materials. For example, the price of thin iron sheets, a raw material for ironwork, has also shown a rise. Before the Lunar New Year, it was 30,000 yuan per ton, but now it has reached more than 45,000 yuan. Situations like this have a profound and significant impact on Chinese factories, and an urgent countermeasure must be planned. (China Intelligence)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Focuses on Developing Northwest Resources Due to the Dim Prospect of Reopening the滇緬 (Yunnan-Burma) Road</h3>
<p>An Alliance News Agency Guangzhou dispatch on February 18 stated: The Chongqing regime is currently actively engaged in promoting the development of Northwest resources, and therefore, despite the assistance of Britain and the United States, there is no hope of reopening the滇緬 (Yunnan-Burma) Road. It is recently learned that Chongqing has specifically designated a week starting from January 15 as Northwest Resources Development Promotion Week. All radio stations, newspapers, and various publications are simultaneously conducting large-scale propaganda to awaken the people's awareness of the importance of developing Northwest natural resources.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Continue to Rise: All at 80 Yuan</h3>
<p>The market for government bonds continued to rise yesterday. All unified government bonds have broken through the 80 yuan mark. There were more buyers than sellers. At the time of settlement, sellers were slow to deliver the goods. Category C bonds initially traded at 3.5 yuan, then fell to 2.3 yuan, and rose to 6.4 yuan, finally settling at 6.2 yuan. It is said that after the market closed, prices were even higher. The other four types traded as follows: Category A at 4.5 yuan, Category B at 3 yuan, Category D at 0.05 yuan, and Category E at 2.5 yuan. The market price of Category C bonds has reached above the high price before August 13, 1937.</p>
<h3>銀錢業 (Banking Industry) Will Still Revert to Opening at 9:00 AM</h3>

<h3>The Development of Currency Work in Central China (3): The Impact of the Concurrent Circulation of Military Scrip and Reserve Notes</h3>
<p>Reserve notes, which have the mission of unifying the currency system of Central and Southern China, have made the currency system of Central China more complicated since their appearance in January of the 29th year of the Republic (1940). These reserve notes developed alongside military scrip, and by the end of August of the year before last (1942), the amount issued had reached 100 million yuan. After the issuance of the fund freezing order, the amount issued expanded for the same reasons as the military scrip mentioned above, reaching 160 million yuan by the end of November, 360 million yuan by the end of December, and approaching 500 million yuan by the end of March last year after the abolition of the new sale of legal tender at par. By September, when the work of fully recovering the old legal tender came to an end, it had reached 1.6 billion yuan, and by November it had already exceeded 2 billion yuan. Of course, this is an extremely gratifying and commendable thing, but what we need to study here is what kind of impact the current concurrent circulation of military scrip and reserve notes has on the economic situation in Central China.</p>
<p>In theory, reserve notes are the currency of the Nanjing National Government, and military scrip is the currency generated by the Japanese Empire to purchase necessary materials and labor during combat. Probably no one disagrees with this point. If we simply take the current situation in Central China as a prerequisite, the original mission mentioned above will not encounter difficulties. However, when working together to replace the old legal tender, many problems arise between military scrip and reserve notes. Here, we examine the economic impact of the two-unit system of military scrip and reserve notes. First, we need to recognize that reserve notes inevitably cause the phenomenon of military scrip reflux.</p>
<p>First, from a fundamental perspective, the two-unit system of military scrip and reserve notes is not a good phenomenon, whether it is for the unification of economic work in Central China or for the psychological impact on the Chinese people. Now that the Japanese Empire and the National Government have become one, not only are they fighting together in military battles, but they must also cooperate with each other in economic warfare. In the same economic camp resisting the old legal tender system, two different currencies are dividing the territory and each going their own way. Can the expected effect still be achieved? This is reflected in the psychology of the Chinese people, and may also have a negative impact on the spiritual unity and cooperation between Japan and China. We should remember the significant role that the Chiang regime's currency unification work played in unifying the Chinese people's hearts and minds, and in further unifying China's politics and economy, before and after the July 7th Incident. This is why we hope to create a unified currency system to replace the old legal tender in the vast territory of Central China, Southern China, and Northern China (not limited to Central China) as much as possible.</p>
<p>Second, looking at the surface of the development of currency work, the concurrent circulation of reserve notes and military scrip only strengthens the counterattack force of the old legal tender, and weakens the effectiveness of the two provinces in resisting the old legal tender. In the same peaceful area, there are two currencies, reserve notes and military scrip, each with its own sphere of influence. Objectively speaking, the lack of concentration or dispersion of power and effectiveness weakens the potential for currency warfare.</p>
<p>Third, from the standpoint of stabilizing commerce and flexible transactions, the two-unit currency system is also not an ideal goal. Finally, the legal exchange rate between military scrip and reserve notes is 18 to 100, and there is generally no major discrepancy in the general market, and speculative phenomena seem to have disappeared. Although in the previous stage, reserve notes were an excellent speculative object——G——G), it cannot be said that there is no room for speculation in military scrip and reserve notes. Moreover, it cannot stabilize commerce and hinders commodity transactions and the revitalization of industry. We will not talk about speculation for the time being, but if we consider the flexibility of transactions, the two-unit currency system requires two calculation methods and two ledgers, which only increases complexity and confusion, and is of no benefit.

<h3>Brokers, the "Enemies of Prices," to Be Eliminated by the Authorities</h3>
<p>Although the Japanese-Chinese authorities have taken various decisive measures to solve the price problem that threatens people's lives, the existence of brokers who seek huge profits between producers and consumers has significantly promoted price increases. In view of this, the consulate police station, the 工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) Economic Police, and the Municipal Social Bureau have decided to work together closely to eliminate brokers. Because the authorities believe that the existence of brokers is one of the reasons why the policy of suppressing prices has led to a gradual rise in prices, it is heard that they will engage in active crackdowns.

<h3>Hua Shares Still Not Reopened: Relevant Authorities to Reorganize</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market has not reopened since trading was suspended. It is heard that the relevant authorities, in view of the overly chaotic organization and structure of the Chinese stock market and various stock companies in this city, will reorganize them. Therefore, there is no news of reopening next Monday.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the competent authorities will carefully consider all matters related to the future operation of Chinese stocks and will then provide a range of guidelines to be followed. Therefore, it is expected that there may be a new look after the stock market reopens this time.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Savings Society Distributes Dividends to Members</h3>
<p>The Four Banks Savings Society has processed the 39th period final settlement in accordance with the regulations from July 1, 1942, to December 31, 1942. The net profit was 100,719.83 yuan in national currency. After deducting the public reserve fund, basic member compensation, employee labor compensation, and public welfare fund, the dividends payable to members were 63,453.49 yuan in national currency, equivalent to a weekly interest rate of 1%, which, together with the guaranteed interest rate of 7%, amounted to a total weekly interest rate of 8%, the same as the previous period. Furthermore, as of the end of December 1942, the total amount of various savings deposits in the society was 22,533,940.18 yuan, of which current savings deposits accounted for the most at 7,100,6794.21 yuan, followed by two-year fixed-term savings deposits at 5,158,506.25 yuan, and then by matured savings deposits at 3,091,040.06 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Market for Gold Bars Likely to Be Eliminated After Authorities Take Decisive Measures</h3>
<p>According to reports received by a Datong News Agency reporter from well-informed sources, the recent surge in the black market for gold has once again attracted close attention from the authorities. It is heard that the authorities are extremely indignant at the speculative merchants' manipulation of gold prices and are currently collecting detailed reports on the activities of these people as a basis for imposing severe punishments in the future. According to relevant parties, the authorities' resolute adoption of this decisive measure is not only due to the soaring black market for gold bars, which is sufficient to stimulate a general rise in prices, but also the silver industry's request to relax the price limit on gold ornaments is also a major factor in prompting this action. The only reason cited by the silver industry for requesting a relaxation of the price limit is that they are losing money, and the reason for their losses is based on the soaring black market for gold bars. According to investigations by the Datong News Agency reporter, the market price of gold bars was restricted by the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities on January 8 of this year, set at 27,500 yuan, while the price limit for gold ornaments was verbally stipulated by Sheng Yudu, the director-general of the Shanghai Municipal Council, when he met with representatives of the silver industry on January 11, set at 3,000 yuan. Recently, some silver shops have raised the selling price of gold ornaments, which has led to severe punishment. It is expected that if the black market for gold bars can be completely eradicated, not only can it be expected that general prices will no longer be subjected to unexpected stimulation, but the problem of the silver industry's request to relax the price limit on gold ornaments will also be solved.</p>
<h3>Japanese Textile Industry Advocates Two Methods for Purchasing Cotton in Central China</h3>
<p>The Japanese textile industry attaches great importance to the sluggish purchase of cotton in Central China. Recently, based on the decision of the East Asia Textile Industry Association, it notified the Shanghai branch of the Textile Industry in China to promptly find ways to promote purchases. After receiving this notice, the Shanghai branch deeply felt the importance of this matter and specially petitioned the authorities on the 18th, requesting understanding. The gist of its petition is: Under the current official price, the most effective and appropriate method is to allocate purchase bonuses and implement a barter system. Other than this, there is no good way to promote purchases. (Continental News, 20th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Levies New Taxes: Income Tax Levied on Monthly Salaries Exceeding 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>A Haitian News Agency Macau dispatch on the 20th stated: The Chongqing regime has promulgated a new income tax law as follows: Those with monthly salaries exceeding 100 yuan must pay income tax according to progressive tax rates. Profits not exceeding 10% of the capital amount may be tax-exempt. Interest on government bonds and bank deposits will be subject to a 5% tax, while income from interest on corporate bonds and non-government bonds will be subject to a 10% tax.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Issues Two New Fixed-Amount Money Orders with Lower Remittance Fees Than Ordinary Ones</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has issued a notice regarding the issuance of new fixed-amount money orders. It states, "Two new fixed-amount money orders of 50 yuan and 100 yuan have now been printed and are being issued simultaneously with the existing fixed-amount money orders of 5 yuan, 10 yuan, and 15 yuan. The remittance fees for these fixed-amount money orders are all lower than those for ordinary money orders. The procedures for purchasing and exchanging them are also simpler than those for ordinary money orders. When purchasing, the remitter only needs to verbally state the amount of the money order and where it is being remitted to the issuer, without having to fill out a "money order purchase slip." After the issuer hands over the money order, they will fill in the name of the payee on the face of the ticket and then seal and mail it to the payee. If there are air routes in the middle, the letter containing the fixed-amount money order can also be sent by airmail, so that the payee can exchange the remittance earlier without having to pay extra airfare as when purchasing ordinary money orders. After the payee receives the fixed-amount money order, they only need to sign and stamp the back of the money order to immediately receive the remittance from the exchange bureau, unlike the ordinary money order method, which requires waiting for the exchange bureau to receive the verification document (i.e., the stub) sent by the issuing bureau before the money can be exchanged. For other details, please inquire with the bureau's staff."</p>
<h3>Demand for United Notes is Relatively Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the interbank interest rate of the Money Trade Association did not change and remained at 1.8%.</p>

Japanese military scrip remained flat. Same traders dealt at 5.5555 yuan but came back up later; finally they still remain within 5.5535 yuan. Small money shops and silver shops in the storefronts quoted prices of 5.56 yuan and 5.545 yuan as entry and exit prices.</p>
<h3>Suppressing Prices Is Imminent: Authorities Hope for Cooperation from Citizens, Encourage Production and Business, and Do Not Hoard</h3>
<p>Okazaki Katsuo, the director-general of the Shanghai Municipal Council, issued a statement the other day to suppress the rising tide of prices, urging the银钱业 (Banking Industry) to stop lending to non-productive businesses. The relevant authorities have recently further indicated that they will encourage major industries to improve the situation. Citizens must implement the following measures to cooperate: (1) Focus on the operation of productive businesses. (2) Individuals should only purchase essential items for practical use. (3) Do not hoard any goods. (4) Rather than engaging in the distribution of finished products, focus on investing in genuine production businesses. (5) Do not engage in speculation in goods and stocks to seek exorbitant profits. (6) Carefully study various investments based on the percentage of previous dividends and profits, and do not rely on impressions and rumors. Before investing, you should also carefully examine the company's balance sheet and profit and loss statement. If citizens can implement the above measures, not only can the high prices be suppressed, but the assets that are currently owned and will be acquired in the future will also be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Northern China Silver Shops After Reorganization</h3>

<p>That is, according to the table on the right, the total number of silver shops in all of Northern China, which was 484 at the time of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, has decreased to 245 one year later, which is about 50%. (China Intelligence, 17th)</p>
<h3>Notice from the Economic Affairs Editorial Department</h3>
<p>The "Economic Affairs" section of this newspaper takes a one-day break every Sunday, and there will be no "Economic Affairs" section on Mondays. Please note.</p>
<h3>Hua Central Tobacco Rationing Association to Begin Rationing from March 1st</h3>
<p>The Hua Central Tobacco Rationing Association, in order to uniformly manage cigarette rationing and eliminate the black market, organized the registration of all cigarette retailers in the city, which ended at the end of January. It has now been reviewed and will be submitted to the board of directors for approval next week. The association will begin rationing on March 1st. The cigarettes to be rationed include: (1) those produced by the Gu Zhong Tobacco Company under military management, (2) those produced by the Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco Company, and (3) those produced by Chinese companies such as Da Dong, Nan Yang, Hua Cheng, and Fu Xin. Rationing and retail prices will be set, and legitimate profits will be granted to each retailer. The authorities will strictly crack down on black market transactions. Any retailer found to be raising prices will have their rationing rights permanently revoked and will be severely punished. It is also reported that, in light of the soaring black market prices of cigarettes, the association, in addition to the authorities taking measures to crack down, decided to have the original dispatching agencies, such as Yongtaihe Company dispatching British American Tobacco, Huayuan Tobacco Firm dispatching Japanese Zhonghua Tobacco, and Nan Yang and Huacheng dispatching Chinese tobacco, each dispatch another batch of goods this month before the official rationing begins in order to stabilize prices. From March onwards, the association will distribute according to the registered forms.</p>
<h3>No Shortage of Sugar Supply</h3>

Therefore, there is no need to worry about a shortage of sugar.</p>

<h3>Points to Note for the Establishment of a Limited Company (3)</h3>
<p>(A) Key points of legal regulations.</p>
<p>5. Number of Directors Article 138 of the Company Law stipulates: "A company shall have a minimum of five directors, who shall be elected from among the shareholders by the shareholders' meeting." Therefore, the articles of association should clearly specify the number of directors. For example, if the company is set to have nine directors, it should be stated that there are nine directors; if the number has not been decided and the articles of association state "nine or eleven directors," this is not in accordance with the law. The number of directors must be an odd number; an even number is also illegal.</p>
<p>6. Issuance of Shares Article 114 of the Company Law states: "A company shall not issue shares unless it has been registered. If shares are issued in violation of the preceding paragraph, the shares shall be invalid; however, the holder of the shares may claim damages from the issuer of the shares." Therefore, a company must issue shares after completing the establishment registration. However, since the establishment registration takes considerable time, the receipts for the share payments held by the shareholders must be properly kept for future exchange for shares.</p>
<p>7. Remuneration of Directors and Supervisors Articles 140 and 153 of the Company Law stipulate: "The remuneration of directors and supervisors shall be determined by the shareholders' meeting unless otherwise specified in the articles of association." Therefore, if the articles of association contain explicit provisions, the remuneration can be paid according to the articles of association; if the articles of association do not clearly specify, the amount must be approved by the shareholders' meeting and cannot be withdrawn arbitrarily.</p>
<p>8. Establishment Registration Article 109 of the Company Law stipulates that if all shares are subscribed for by the promoters, the directors shall, within 15 days after the completion of the capital verification by the competent authority; if the shares are not subscribed for by the promoters, the directors shall, within 15 days after the completion of the incorporation meeting, apply to the competent authority for registration of the following matters: (1) the name of the company, (2) the business operated, (3) the total amount of shares and the amount of each share, (4) the location of the head office and branches, and (5) the method for the company to make announcements; (2) the amount of capital already paid for each share, (3) the names and addresses of the directors and supervisors, and (4) if there are reasons for dissolution, the reasons.

<h3>Analysis of the Changes in Hua Stock Prices from the Beginning to the End of 1942</h3>
<p>(2) Comparison of the annual market price of Dasheng Factory No. 1, 3, and 2, which has the highest rise</p>
<p>Over the past year or so, if we only consider the multiples of the rise and fall of Chinese stocks, Dasheng Yarn Factory No. 1, 3, and 2 in Nantong can be said to be the most prominent. The market price of Dasheng Factory No. 1 at the beginning of last year was 20 yuan at the last time, which was still the selling price, but recently it has exceeded 600 yuan; it has surged by 30 times in the past thirteen months. The lowest price of Factory No. 3 at the beginning of last year was 25 yuan, and now it has also exceeded 500 yuan, reaching 20 times; both are amazing. The left figure shows the upward trend of the stock prices of these two stocks.</p>

<h3>Time</h3>
<p>— Yu Tian</p>
<p>In the process of time, there are three stages: "present," "past," and "future."</p>
<p>The past has no meaning, even though it is full of traces of "experience," but it is mostly old and corrupt, and not worth reviewing. When a person recalls the past, it often makes him sad, because the scars of life will cause him hidden pain. If the past is perfect, it will make him uninterested in reality and lose the will to live, lingering in the past, only seeking comfort in dreams, thus becoming decadent, annoyed, passive, and not striving for progress. So only thinking about the past is somewhat toxic.</p>
<p>The future is too vague, living in the imaginary kingdom, although it is ethereal and infinitely happy, but once you open your eyes, the scenery in front of you is completely different. You can't help but sigh and curse the world, thus becoming indulgent, disappointed, pessimistic, and deviating from the normal course of life, with a sad face, as if everything is impossible, and even destroying your own life, willingly becoming a "martyr." So looking forward to the future is ultimately empty.</p>
<p>I think the most precious thing is the present, which is neither toxic nor empty. Working hard in a down-to-earth manner is the most valuable. However, the "present" also encounters different "smooth" and "adversity." We must remember that in "smooth" times, we must arrange things well, and in "adversity," we must struggle at all costs. We must know that the "present" will become the "past" in the near future, and it was also the "future" not long ago. Therefore, as long as we strive to obtain a perfect "present," we don't need to caress the scars of the past, nor do we need to build castles in the air.</p>
<p>The voyage of life advances in the sea of time, and it is inevitable that there will be dangerous winds and waves. A veteran boatman certainly accepts the lessons of the past and predicts the safety of the future, but most importantly, he knows that he must hold the rudder firmly and move forward inch by inch, bravely and resolutely towards the other shore.</p>
<h3>A Dismissed Child</h3>
<p>— Shi Jun</p>
<p>One of the Teacher's Diary Social Problems? Children's Problems?</p>
<p>Yesterday, the school held a temporary school affairs meeting. Because I am the homeroom teacher of the fifth and sixth grades, and the discussion this time was about the fifth and sixth grades, I had to attend even though I had taken a week of sick leave.</p>
<p>In addition to the director of education, Wu, the attendees were all teachers who taught the fifth and sixth grades. Wu first reported that Cao Zulong—the most mischievous child in the fifth grade—had committed a major crime the day before yesterday: stealing a fountain pen from the girl Wang Ruixiang. Cao Zulong's classmate Huang Linbao informed on him, and after Qing San's questioning and investigation, "the offender" himself also "frankly admitted."</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to maintain school spirit and warn others, Wu advocated expulsion. Shen, Lin, and Tang all agreed. I, of course, had nothing to say and followed the majority opinion.</p>
<p>So a letter was immediately sent to "Dear Parent."</p>
<p>Today, when I dragged my newly recovered body to class, there was an empty seat in the third row, and I didn't see that familiar, active black face.</p>
<p>As if I had lost something, I was stunned for a long time. I didn't talk to the children about Cao Zulong's matter, because maybe I couldn't talk them out of it. Cao Zulong's activity was often praised by me, and he got along well with most of the students. His intelligence and strength made him a leader.</p>
<p>I also vaguely saw melancholy and sadness on their innocent little faces—they probably already knew about it.</p>
<p>But what surprised me was that when I walked into the alley that evening, a small hand grabbed me in the dark.</p>
<p>"It's me, Mr. Shi!" The familiar, active voice was even more in the dark.</p>
<p>"Cao Zulong?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Mr. Shi!" The voice was a little different.</p>
<p>I took him back to my house.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here so late?" I was very strange.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shi!" Under the light, I saw tearful eyes full of tears on the sad black face, and there was no longer the active and brave look: "Can you... let me... continue to study?..."</p>
<p>"..." I shook my head coldly.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shi!..." He almost cried out.</p>
<p>"Who told you to steal other students' things!" I looked at the table, "There's nothing I can do about it!"</p>
<p>"I know it's my... my fault!" A trembling hand wiped the tears that flowed down: "But this... this is not... I'm willing to do it... There's nothing I can do..."</p>
<p>"What? Who forced you?" I was even stranger.</p>
<p>"Father said: The rent for three months... hasn't been paid!" The sobbing voice was intermittent, "...Now it's the end of the year,... if you don't pay... you'll be... driven... out... But father... hasn't done business for four months!... Not a penny..."</p>
<p>"But you shouldn't steal other people's things because of this!"</p>
<p>"Old Ma next door mentioned occasionally last time... he saw someone buy a fountain pen for twenty yuan... The rent for three months is only... only fifty-four yuan... It happened to fall on the ground... I just... Who knew... Father sold it to someone for only thirty yuan!... It's still not enough!..."</p>
<p>I was silent.</p>
<p>"...I don't know how... Huang Linbao saw it... Yesterday... Mr. Wu and Mr. Shen... asked me... Mr. Shi used to say... honesty is the best... so I said it... Now... they've..."</p>
<p>He suddenly began to sob on the table.</p>
<p>"What's the use of crying?"</p>
<p>"This... it's not... I'm... willing!" He stopped his tears, took out a very wrinkled two-jiao note from his pocket, and put it in front of me without hesitation: "I'm now... going to save... enough thirty yuan... to... return it to her... Mr. Shi, please keep it for me..."</p>
<p>"Okay!" I stared at the old jiao note that had been caressed for a long time.</p>
<p>"—So can I continue to study?" The black face full of tears looked at my face like a prisoner awaiting the final verdict, and his eyes were full of hope.</p>
<p>"..." I shook my head in silence.</p>
<p>A layer of despair immediately covered the black face, and the hope in his eyes disappeared suddenly.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shi! Thank you!"—It was the last struggle: "...I've been waiting in the alley for a long time!"</p>
<p>"..." I shook my head in silence.</p>
<p>He looked at everything in the room in despair, and finally silently walked out of the room, walked down the stairs, and silently walked out of the back door.</p>
<p>I went out with him.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have abandoned a smart, honest, and quickly repentant child!"—A voice like iron rang in my ears.</p>
<p>"Cao Zulong!" I called out. "You—you come to my place every night!"</p>
<p>At first he stared at me blankly, as if he didn't understand, and finally threw himself on me:</p>
<p>"Mr. Shi! You're really..."</p>
<p>"Go back!"</p>
<p>"I'll bring two jiao tomorrow!" At the entrance of the alley, he suddenly turned around and shouted loudly.</p>
<h3>Small Bowl and Little Rice, How Can It Be Enough?</h3>
<p>— Written by Tianming</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Reading "The Law of Preserving Wealth"</h3>
<p>— Tang Jingde</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Nie Yuntai's "The Law of Preserving Wealth," I was very moved and couldn't help but write something to show off. I remember when I was a child, I often heard my grandfather talk to people saying, "I have worked hard all my life, and I have no money or land to pass on to my children. What's the use of a wise descendant? What's the use of an unwise descendant? It's better to accumulate virtue in the dark, so that descendants can enjoy it endlessly." His old man's intention was: If good descendants are born, they will earn money to live on their own, so why use money, land, and other inheritances; if bad descendants are born, even if the father has a generous inheritance, it can be squandered in an instant, then what's the use of it, wouldn't it harm the descendants instead? (Examples of wealth can be seen in Mr. Nie's "The Law of Preserving Wealth") Therefore, accumulating virtue in the dark can make descendants use it endlessly and take it inexhaustibly.</p>
<p>Then here we have to ask, what is "accumulating virtue"? Accumulating virtue is the only way to preserve wealth. The most concise answer is to not harm others to benefit oneself, and further, to help others and even relieve them according to the environment, which is accumulating virtue. Because everyone can look down on rights and emphasize obligations, and everyone takes service as the first priority and helping others as the goal, wouldn't it directly help oneself and save oneself? The ancients said: "Helping others helps oneself," which is what it means.</p>
<p>Speaking of helping others and relieving them, there is also a word "love" in between, because without a loving heart, there is no way to talk about helping others and relieving them. For example, if you meet a beggar on the road who is begging you, you have already developed a feeling of disgust for his appearance, and before he opens his mouth, you have already waved your hand and told him to get out, then how can you relieve him? The reason is very simple, there is a lack of "love"—a sense of compassion. However, if you can experience Confucius's saying "take analogies nearby," then you will be very willing to help him. The meaning is: You compare yourself to the beggar at the time, and at the same time, you consider the beggar as a rich person, and you ask him to beg, and he waves his hand and tells you to get out, do you feel embarrassed? After such consideration, you will be willing to give generously.</p>
<p>Confucius said: "Love the multitude and be close to the benevolent." To ask people to broadly love the masses is close to "benevolence." The word "benevolence" comes from one person, and anything that expresses compassion can be called "benevolence." Han Tuizhi explained it most thoroughly in "The Original Way," saying: "Broad love is called benevolence." Jesus also said: "Love your neighbor as yourself." Everyone loves themselves, as well as their parents, wives, and children, and they are relatively distant to their relatives and friends, and even more different to strangers. Mencius said: "Respect the old of your family, and extend it to the old of others; love the young of your family, and extend it to the young of others." Extrapolate and extend it, from loving your own parents and children to loving other people's parents and children. You must know that everyone has food to eat, and then you have food to eat; everyone can live in peace and be happy to work, and then you can have a comfortable life, otherwise, if you are rich alone and people are poor, even if you are unwilling to give relief, won't the poor stand up and take risks, and won't you be directly harmed? In other words, wealth cannot be preserved. This is the consequence of not being able to extend love to others.</p>
<p>At this time, there are quite a few profiteers in Shanghai. Once they get rich, they only seek to satisfy their desires, and then seek excessive enjoyment in material and spiritual terms. They don't care about the future, they don't care about their descendants, and they don't care about the masses who can't afford to eat. They have goods, and they hope for high prices. The ancients accumulated grain to relieve famine, but today people hoard goods to wait for prices. This situation is really incomparable.</p>
<p>To be honest: A person comes with empty hands and leaves with empty hands, it just depends on what kind of career he has done. Some are unheard of in the world; some have a name that will last forever; some descendants will not decline for generations; some descendants are unknown. It depends on how each person does it. Liang Chenggong said: "The happiest thing in life is to fulfill one's responsibilities." This "responsibility" is the "thing" that is responsible for oneself, for others, and for the society and the country, and can also be said to be service. To do a job from beginning to end, to be diligent and hardworking in service, is to fulfill one's responsibility. When responsibility is fulfilled, one is relaxed and feels infinite comfort and happiness in spirit.</p>
<p>The ancients said: "Doing good is joyful." "Doing good" is fulfilling one's responsibility to others, that is, helping others and relieving others; indirectly fulfilling one's responsibility to the society and the country. Because responsibility is fulfilled, it is most joyful. I also often hear old people say: "It is better to have a broad mind than a wide house." A wide house is being wealthy. However, wealthy people do not necessarily have a broad mind, and people with a broad mind can lead to a wide house. It turns out that a broad mind is doing good; doing good is fulfilling responsibility; fulfilling responsibility can be said to be "virtue"; accumulating virtue is the only way to preserve wealth. So my conclusion is:</p>
<p>Benefiting others is benefiting oneself,</p>
<p>Why not scatter wealth instead of preserving it?</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The "Law of Preserving Wealth" has been recognized by readers as beneficial to the world and people's hearts, and it is appropriate for everyone to have a copy. If you want to attach a single-page reprint, please contact the Social Service Department.</p>
<h3>Humility</h3>
<p>— Qi Wu</p>
<p>We should humbly learn from others' good examples.</p>
<p>Regardless of ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, whether they are our friends or enemies, we should imitate others' strengths.</p>
<p>Choosing strengths to make up for weaknesses is precisely a work that each of us should do.</p>

<h3>The Teacher of All Ages (16)</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>"Uh, Gregson—ahem—I remember you—ahem—you're slow at everything—aren't you? Maybe you'll grow up to be—ahem—like me—old—ahem—also slow—aren't you?" Afterwards, when he was alone again, Mrs. Wiggatt came in to clear away the tea set, and he had to say: "Mrs. Wiggatt, young Gregson was here—ahem—you remember him, don't you? The tall one with glasses. Always slow. Ahem. Working in the League of Nations—ahem—there—I think—his—ahem—slowness—isn't necessarily noticeable—is it?"</p>
<p>Sometimes, when the roll call bell rang, he would walk to the window and look out through the fence of the roadside school, looking far away to see those students lined up in a long line, passing the bench. New times, new names... But everything old still remains... Jefferson, Jennings, Jolyon, Jupo, Kingsley Primus, Kingsley Secundus, Kingsley Tertius, Kingston... You're all there, where have you all gone?... Mrs. Wiggatt, give me another cup of tea before prep, I'm sorry, can you?</p>
<p>The ten years after the Great War, a chaotic change and adjustment swept past; Jipps was in it, looking around, and felt greatly disappointed. Ruhr, Chanak, Corfu; there were enough restless events in the world. However, close to him, in Brookfield, and even broadly speaking, in England, there were still things that fascinated him, because they were old—and had seen the vicissitudes of life. He gradually saw more and more that the other world was a big mess, and England was pastoral enough for it—perhaps too much. But he was content with Brookfield. Many things have been tested by the times and the changes of war, and the foundation of Brookfield is deeply rooted in these things. (42)</p>

<h3>Cold Light and Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Cold light, also known as short-wave ultraviolet light, is a translation of Cold Quartz, which is slightly different from ordinary violet light lamps. According to the setting of ordinary violet light lamps, long-wave light is used, and part of the light power has been transformed into heat power, so the light emitted is very hot, and the transmission power is reduced accordingly, and the sterilization power is not very large. Cold light lamps are different. The light is cold and not hot, so it can exert full light power, and the transmission power is more than 30 times stronger than ordinary ultraviolet light, and the sterilization power is also strengthened somewhat. Therefore, for tubercle bacilli deep in the lungs, it can penetrate deeply into the skin and make its contribution, this is one: After irradiation with ordinary violet light lamps, the skin is easily blackened, and the existence of this black pigment can prevent the light from penetrating and reduce its effect. Cold light, with appropriate time, distance, and light intensity configuration, does not present this drawback, this is two: Therefore, cold light is the most modern therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. Not only that, cold light can also test for the presence or absence of lung disease, and its effect is the same as X-ray fluoroscopy. The skin reactions presented by patients after irradiation are different for each person. The strength of the reaction can be used to measure the severity of lung disease. This is also a new discovery. Today, those who talk about the diagnosis and treatment of lung disease seem to be unable to diagnose without X-rays and cannot treat without air needles. It is not known that cold light actually has superior diagnostic and therapeutic effects. Fearing that the world has not noticed, I have described its general meaning as such.</p>
