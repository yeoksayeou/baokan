<p>社評</p>
<h3>大東亞會議</h3>
<p>舉世矚目的大東亞會議，昨日開始在東京舉行，這次盛會的消息，事前絕未露佈，從而可知各國當局沉靜持重的熊度，準備推誠相與，披瀝所信，切切實實的討論共同目標，共同間題。這與喧嚷已久，所謂「英美蘇三强會議」，結果流產而改為三國外長會議的一幕，在聲色上已是截然不同。況且「三國外長會議」在英美狡詐，同床異夢的矛　中，甫告收塲，我們亞洲人一致團結的大東亞會議立即展幕，如果說大東亞　議為了答復他們而舉行，那末把他們估計太高，未免比儗不稱。我們可以說，大東亞會議是在團結一心的情緒下，為完成共同目標而推誠商討，以事實粉碎英美的奸詐。所以，大東亞會議與三國外長會議，在結果上也是截然不同的。</p>
<p>這次大東亞會議，包括六個獨立國家—中國，日本，泰國，滿洲國，緬甸，菲律賓，暨印度臨時政府等七個單位的代表，都是各國負實際責任的行政首長，實為歷史上空前的重耍會議。</p>
<p>盟邦日本倡導建設大東亞共榮圈以來，不辭與英美作戰，因為英美在東亞的侵略勢力，是建設東亞新秩序的最大障得，非先澈底剷除不可。兩年之中，英美勢力遂漸擊滅，進而協助緬甸與菲律賓之獨立建國，印度臨時政府成立，使東亞民族完全脫卻英美荷等的侵略桎梏，而解放自由。更以日本為中心，結成各國的同盟陣錢</p>
<p>由於盟邦日木領導奮鬥的結果，亞洲人的亞洲的理想，今日已經完全實現，所以，大東亞共榮圈的外形，事實上已達最高理想的境地。今後所應努力的方向，我們認為不在共榮圈外形的如何結成，而在共榮圈內質的如何鞏固。這次會議的主要課題，也應在此。</p>
<p>共榮圈外形的結成，殊非易事，盟邦日本領導艱鉅，致力獨多，尤為東亞人民所共睹。可是，共榮圈內質的鞏固，其艱難繁重，更十倍於外形的結成。如果內質不鞏固，則外形殊嫌脆弱，外形的保持，決定於內質的鞏固，如何鞏固內質，當非日本單獨力量所能負荷，每個國家各有其責任。第一，共榮圈內每個國家，站在義務同等的地位，對於鞏面共榮圈，各自貢獻其力量，但絕非形式上的分配，而是事實上的負担。因此，各國的力量，應有平均發展，俾有名符共實的協力。第二，各國對於本身的弱點，應毫無…隱諱的開誠披瀝，共同商討如何協力加强之道。加强各國的力量，就是加强大東亞共榮圈的力量</p>
<p>我們會在本年五月一日的社評中，提出過「太平洋憲章的期待」，為了建設東亞新秩序，為了完成太平洋諸國與諸民族的獨立自巾解放，一致團結爭取大東亞戰爭勝利，實現這種目的，我們迫切需要一面光輝的旗幟——太平洋憲章，作為號召我們每一個東亞人民努力的推動機。其次，獲取勝利以後，我們需要適合共同要求與共同理　的根本大法——太平洋憲章，作為實現大東亞新秩序的工作指南。這一次的大柬亞會議，無疑是決定太平洋憲章的時候了。</p>
<p>為了爭取大東亞戰爭的勝利，為了完成東亞新秩序的建設，我們敬祝大東亞會議進行順利！圓滿成功！</p>
<h3>大東亞各國會議　在東京隆重舉行　期迅速完成復興東亞偉業</h3>
<p>京五日中央社電　中·日·　·泰·緬·菲六國，以自由印度臨時政府成立及中。日盟約締結後，解放亞洲，復與東亞之偉業，頗有進展，同時大東亞新秩序之政治機　亦告完成，為期迅速完成此共同目的，各國於此際，實有團結一致之必要，並應向世界具體宜揚亞洲之理想及大東亞之信念，因此，中·日。滿。泰·非。緬六國政府代表決定最近在東京舉行大東亞會議，屆時自由印度臨時政府主席扛特拉鮑斯亦將列席。關於此事日情報局於四日下午二時發表如次：大東亞各國已立於着憐友好，互助協力之張固基礎，為完成共同目的而共同奮闕，就大柬亞戰爭與大東亞建設之方針閒誠協議起見，決定推派代表在東京舉行大東亞會議，又自由印度臨時政府代表，因公勾留東京，亦行列席。</p>
<h3>日東條首相　被推為議長　會議塲空氣緊張熱烈</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　大東亞會議，已於卽日起，假此間會議塲隆重舉行。中·日·泰·滿·菲·緬·六獨立國代表，暨印度臨時政府主席集於一堂，代表大東亞十億民衆總意，展開歷史空前盛會。會塲內　懸各國國旗，各國代表暨列席者，陪席者共四十六氏，皆於準時到塲。會議自十時舉行，首由日本代表東條首相致開會詞，旋即舉行議長推　式，由泰國代表溫華親王動議，推戴日本國代表東條首相為議長，結果滿塲一致通過，旋由東條議長就坐中央之議長席，右側為我國代表國民政府汪行政院長，滿洲國代表國務總理張景惠氏，緬匈國代表內閣總理巴莫氏，左側為泰國代表內閣總理顧間溫華達亞肯親王，非律賓共和國代表洛勒爾大總統，印度臨時政府主席扛特拉　斯，皆并肩或相向就席。又各國列席者，均就坐於各該國代表背後指定之席位，遂即入於會議階段，互就完遂大東亞戰爭與建設大東亞之根本方策，開誠陳述意見，但發首者僅限於各國代表。并以各國既定號數順席發言。上午為日本帝國代表東條首相與我國代表汪行政院長先後發言。午問稍事休息，共進午餐，，下午一時復開，繼由泰·滿·非·緬各國代表順序發言，各國代表聚精會神靜聆發言，發會者之語句，由各國代表之翻譯分別譯為共本國語，會塲空氣極為緊張熱烈。</p>
<p>東京五日中央社電　大東亞會議於即日下午重開，由各國代表繼續發表演說，先由滿洲國代表張國務總理演銳，嗣由非代表洛勒爾總統演說，表明新生非律賓之熱意信念，約歷一小時。至午後二時四十五分稍事休憩後，又於三時半重開，最後由緬甸總理巴莫發表演說後，至四時半完畢第一日日程。</p>
<h3>東亞民族奮起　協力完遂戰爭　東條首相演辭要旨</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　大東亞會議中，日本代表東條首相演說要旨如次：英帝國於過去數世紀中，以其侵略征服政策於全球獲得廣大領土，且欲永久維持其優越地位於世界各地，使他國相互對立抗爭。同時美國亦乘歐洲動亂之機會，不僅於美洲大陸確立覇權，且以美　戰爭為契機，對太平洋及亞洲方面亦伸出　手，復以第一次世界大戰為轉機，輿英國共逞共制覇世界之野心。而此次世界戰事勃發後，美國更進一步覬　北非四非大西洋澳洲近東及印度方面，欲取英國之地位而代之。英美平案倡導所謂樹立國際正義與保障世界和平者，乃在助長歐洲各國家之分裂輿抗爭，使亞洲殖民地立榨取永久繼續，以維持彼等之利己的秩序觀</p>
<p>英美政策侵略榨取</p>
<p>英美對亞洲所施政策，彼等於政治方面施以侵略，於經濟方面實行榨取，更以教靑文化等美名，使各民族喪失民族性相互衝突，俾達成其望，因此亞洲各國家各民族之生存常受威脅，失卻安定秩序，民生方面之止常發展亦遭受阻礙以迄於今。彼等呼號之門戶開放及機會均等主義，乃以東亞殖民地化之根本觀念為出發點，此實為彼等欲達成侵略東亞之非望所採之手段。彼等於其自國領土內，則常對東亞各民族實行封鎖門戶，使機會不均等，並阻礙交易，但求彼等之利益的繁榮，英美兩國欲制　世界之野望，實可謂人類之不幸輿世界之禍根。囘顯東亞各國家各民族問會不斷興起解放之義舉，此則或遭暴戾英美之武力彈壓，或遭彼等惡翔之離間政策而歸於失敗。故此時日本之與　，乃為英美所最　惡者，於是彼等每對日本出以抑壓態度，同時策謀離問日本與東亞之各國家各民族，是卽彼等東亞政策之要諦</p>
<p>為求生存起與周旋</p>
<p>蓋彼等欲維持東亞奴隸化之狀態，乃認東亞任何　家之勃興，或東亞各國各民族之團結時為不利最近數年來英美此種使東亞奴隸化之野望愈形露骨而趨險惡，即唆使渝方阻碍中日兩國國交，終至發生不幸之中日事變，並以種種手段企圖，妨碍事變之解決。及此次歐戰勃發後，更藉口戰爭妨碍和平之道商，進而榨取于本質上與戰爭無異之經濟絕交，同時于東亞四周增强武備，欲强使我國屈從，於此東亞之安定即感受重大威　，帝國不顧英美此種態度，仍努力避免禍亂波及東亞，隱忍自重，欲以和平交涉收拾時局，然英美並未表示何等反省互讓之態并，反愈加强威嚇與壓迫，使帝國之生存瀕於危殆，帝國為自存自衛，終不得已而崛起，於此對東亞挑戰之惡勢力周旋，於茲粉碎一切妨碍為確立東亞永久之和平，乃向決戰之途邁進。大東亞戰爭開始後，帝國陸海軍以驍勇善戰，未及半載即將英美之侵略勢力驅出東亞。</p>
<p>萬衆一心充滿鬥志</p>
<p>大東亞各國或布吿宣戰，與帝國並肩作戰或緊密協力完遂戰爭，於今大東亞各民族之自覺與熱情，已充滿大東亞之天地內則相信相和外則擊滅英美之反攻以求自存自術，俾確立大東亞之永久安定。此次戰爭，就大東亞整個民族而　，改善興廢存亡之大決戰，惟有在此次戰爭中獲得勝利，大東亞各民族始能在東亞天地內永遠確保其生存，偕共榮之樂土。大東亞戰爭之完成，厥為大東亞新秩序之確立，英美舉其所懷之物資之戰力，向大東亞實行反攻者定為當然。故時至今日，大東亞各國均已舉其全力，　底粉碎英美之反攻，進而子以完成戰爭，而確保大東亞之安定。而當此之際，帝國已立於決戰所得有利之戰略地位，繼續實行雄渾之作戰，在國內則為呼應此雄渾之作戰，整備國內態勢，最近為謀使國內態勢成為決戰化起見，全國人民已在一億一心必勝之確信下，以堅靭之鬥志共同奮鬥，以貫　大東亞戰爭。余確信各位所代表之大東亞各國，亦無不決意與帝國相呼應，舉其全力　滅英美，以謀永遠安定大東亞，</p>
<p>建設東亞基本見解</p>
<p>茲余願一述帝國政府對建設大東亞之基本見解，余確信使世界各國各得其所，相依相扶而偕萬邦共榮之樂者，乃確立世界各國家相依相扶各　養其國家基礎，結成共存共榮之組帶，同時與其他國家成立協和偕樂之關係者，自為確立世界和平之最有效且實際之途徑。大東亞各國在各方面均具有難分之緊密關係，乃為不可否認之事實，故余確信大東亞各國於此關係上互相協力，確保大東亞之安定，建設共存共榮之秩序者，乃為各國之共同使命也。大東亞之共存共榮秩序，乃以大東亞固有之道義精神為其基礎，此與英美之舊秩序根本這異。良以英美之舊秩序，專為自己之繁榮着想，極盡一切欺騙榨取之能事，以道義為基礎之大東亞新建設，於大戰進行中巳着着見諸實現。然英美之對印方策又為如何。</p>
<p>印度獨立奠定基礎</p>
<p>今日英國之壓迫印度已　日緝烈，又最近美國對印度亦抱有野心，彼等與印度民衆之傾軋乖離益趨激化，今印度四四民衆所受之　苦，實非言語所可形容，最近印度所發生空前之飢　，亦係英美所致，此在英美自身亦自認不諱，今印度國內有志之士悉被拘入獄，無　之民衆嗷嗷待哺，日處愁城，其狀之慘實為世界最大之悲劇，並為人類共憤之事，凡我大東亞民族目諸印度慘狀，無不義不憤　，同時吾人對於此事實難放置，當此時也，印度志士江特拉鮑斯毅然崛起，印度國內外人士亦起而　應，於茲乃見印度臨時政府之樹立，印度獨立之基礎亦吿奠定。帝國前曾向中外聲明，帝國決對印度之爭取獨立予以一切之協力與支援，余確信大東亞各國亦必將對印度之爭取獨立，衷心予以協力也。英美今日對印度所取之政策與彼等在大西洋憲章所標者根本迥　，時至今日，彼等實已無法自　其說矣。然而吾人目睹彼等之矛盾現象，並不驚異，蓋世人對英美言行之矛盾，早已屢見不鮮，並知欺騙偽裝乃為英美之本性。</p>
<p>最後勝利信念益堅</p>
<p>無論敵方欲何所作為，祇須帝國與大東亞各國互相提携共同奮鬥，則必能從英美桎梏中解放大東亞。大東亞各國互相協力，則大東亞之復興與昌隆指日可期，今大東亞各國家各民族已打成一片共同努力，以實行萬邦共榮之理想及建設大東亞。反觀歐洲之情勞盟邦德國已加强國民之團結，而以必勝之信念努力擊滅英美與建設歐洲，殊堪期待。夫大東亞戰爭，實乃廳邪顯正之聖戰，大義名分顯然，在我正義之師所向無敵，故勝利終必在我，此為吾人所深信不疑者。於茲帝國對大東亞各國衷心協力大東亞戰爭之盛情，深表敬意，同時並期待今後大東亞各國以及歐洲各盟邦加堅提携，應付今後日益激烈之戰局，在必勝之信心下，以堅忍不拔之鬥志，克服一切困難，貫澈吾人共同使命之大東亞戰爭，並完成火東亞建設，俾對眞正世界和平之確立有所貢獻</p>
<h3>十億民族堅强團結　東亞史劃期之一頁</h3>
<p>南京五日中央社電　以團結束亞十億民族為主旨之大東亞會議，集東亞六大國家負責之代表，於日本東京隆重。揭　　東亞建設之基石，揚世界道義之先聲，不僅為東亞史劃期之一頁，亦為世界史空前所未有。常此中日同盟條約　結甫及一週，我國上下正深慶祝獨立自主完成之時，國　汪行政院長又借隨員等親赴東京出席大東亞會議，與東亞各國家各民族最高負責人員聚首一堂，就完成共同戰爭加强東亞團結。及推進共榮建設等開誠會議，是故國父大亞洲主義之遣　，更得因此　　實現，方今東亞各國已各自於本然之姿態上，相互作緊密提携，而結成堅强之協力樞軸，以此痛擊呼號反攻之英美，足可粉碎其再圖侵略東亞之　心，而澈底擊破其制覇世界之迷夢。大東亞建設乃以東方之道義為基礎。以東亞之共榮為目標，期由此而為確立世界和平某礎之一環，故可新言大東亞會議於此開幕，實足以表示東亞十億民族團結一致，為擊滅英美完成建設而　進之決心。</p>

<h3>汪代表在日演说　申明我政府決心　分担完遂戰爭與建設責任</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　英華民國代表汪兆路氏，於大東亞會議席上發表演說如次：在世界歷史有偉大意義的大東亞會議，今日在盟邦日本的首都舉行，剛纔聽到東條總理大臣閣下的演說，十分與奮，英美人在東亞，百年以前已經開始，在這嚴重時期英，賴有日本的軍事力量，以及政治，徑濟·文化各方面的力量，方始能限制住英·的侵略野心，保障東亞不致為英美所割據。最近更發動大東亞戰爭，粉碎了英·美在東亞的侵略勢力，英·美在西太平洋及南洋一帶的海陸軍根據地，次第為日本海陸軍所擊破。所占領。日本更進一步，本嬌束方道義精神，議東亞諸民族國家之共存共榮，援助共獨立自主，完成其愛國的志願，使之各就本位，各盡其最大的努力，以分担完遂大東亞戰爭，完成大東亞建設之貴任。鄙人對於日本這種崇高偉大的抱負及其光輝的成緒，謹致最大的敬意。同時對於夙相友好的滿·泰兩國，和新興的緬·菲兩國及印度臨時政府，以堅定的決心，强殺的努力，來分担大東亞戰爭及大東亞建設之責任，謹致最大的敬意。英華民岡為東亞一份子，鄙人得藝此機令，把國民政府對於大東亞戰爭完途及大東亞建設方針之決心與努力有所中說，實　柴奉。</p>
<p>打破侵略勢力桎梏</p>
<p>中華民國的國父孫先生，一生抱負，在使中國及東亞能打破英·美時略勢力的桎桔，完成其獨立自主，本於這抱負，畢生奮鬥至逝世之日整整四十年。在逝世的一個多月以來，曾在日本神戶兩次的演說，一次是在民國十三年十一月二十八日，所演說的是大亞洲主義，這裏頭說明我們亞洲是最古文化的發祥地，到了最近百年以來，被英·美侵略，綫漸漸衰弱起來，幾乎沒有一們完全獨立的國家，然而衰弱到了極端的時候，忽然有了轉機，這就是日本的維新，日本的維新，是日本在亞洲成為先進國的原因，同時也就是亞洲復興的基點。亞洲各國應該興先進國的日本同心協力，根據東方王進的文化，以戰勝西方霸道的文化，把英·美的侵略勢力驅除乾凈，以亞洲各國的團結，來完成亞洲各國的獨立自主，這樣纔能使整個亞洲由衰微而轉到復興。還有一次，也是在同年某月某日，所演說的是日本應對中國廢除不平等條約，這英頭說明中日兩國和兄弟一樣，日本從前也會受過不平等條約的東縛，因為獲奮自强，綫能將束縛掙斷，成為東方的先進國，世界的强國。中國現在也正在掙扎着廢除不平等條約，盼望日本極力援助中國的解放，就是來亞的解放。以上兩篇演說，是國父孫先土一生最後的演說，自此以後，國父孫先生便患病在牀，終嬌明年三月十二日，在北京逝世了，當逝世的時候，將遺囑留給後死同志，要後死同志本此遺志，繼續奮門，以期日徹，潑不幸的、國父孫先土逝世後，遺志未能實現，中·日關係不但不能好轉，反而日日加壞，終於在民國二十六年七月發生事變，距離國父孫先生逝世十二年了。</p>
<p>·將士人民終必來歸·</p>
<p>在這時候，中·日失和·英美視為最好時機，挑撥離間，惟恐中·日事變之不據大，不廷長，我們同志看見國父遺志之未能實現，英·日關係之日益惡化，痛心已極，幾乎　嬌絕望之深淵。好在日本政府不久便將結束事變的方針宣布出來了，說明日本之目的，不在中國之減亡，而在中國之興隆，日本期待中國分擔建設束亞之責任，日本並決心援馴中國，完展其獨立自主的願望，我們同志聽見了日本這樣的宣布眞意，知道好轉中·日關系，完成國父遣志，還是右希望的，所以首先便動告重慶當局放棄抗戰，恢復和平，及至勸告不聽，方綫不得已脫出重慶，為和平運動而奔走，終於國民政府還都南京，堂堂正正向中·日提携，復興東亞致共最大之努力。上頭說過，英·美對於中·日事變挑潑離間，意在使之擴大，使之延長，自國民政府還都以後，遺種手段更加緊了，英·美對於重慶引誘抗戰，阻橈和平，無所不用其極，及至大東亞戰爭發生以後，英·美鑒於在東亞勢力之挫折興消失，其利用重慶牽制日水之企圖更加急切，這已是世昇共知的事實。然而我們政於斷定·英·美這種企圖，不久定然失敗的，何以呢，重變方面無論將士與人民，都係以國父孫先生之遺教為依歸的，今年一月九日以來，日本對於中國提前交還租昇，撤廢治外法權，尤其潑近以中·日同盟條約替代了中·日基本關係條約，並將各種附慶文書一概廢棄，國父孫先生所提倡的大亞洲主義，巳見了光明了。國父孫先土所盼望日本援助英國廢除不平等條約，已成爲事實了。即使英·美如何引誘，如何阻撓，終不能遏止住重慶方面的覺悟，即使一昨羈絆住了，重慶方面終右一日覺悟到依存英·美，便是東亞的叛逆，同時便是國父孫先生的叛逆，無論將士及人民，終必有幡然來歸之一日，這是可以斷定的。</p>
<p>·保障治安增加生產·</p>
<p>國民政府在這最關重要的時期，惟有認定向來的方針，加緊努力，一方面促成重　將士及人民之覺悟來歸，完成統一。一方面就政治力所能到的地方，樹立一個模範，其工作約有三個重點，第一：　正思想，第二：保　治安，第三：增加生產，所　肅正思想，是將英·美個人主義，功利主義的思想，徹底清除，代之以東方道義精神，以東亞人的目費心，　復到東亞人的本來面目，一心一德為東亞人的共存共榮而奮鬥。所謂保障治安，是認定英國所處是大東亞戰爭的後方，必須使治安確保，綫能使盟邦的前綫將士無後顧之憂，綫能專進一步輪送軍隊于前綫，稍分盟邦將士之勞苦。所謂增加生產，是使一切經濟計劃，財政計劃右了重心，增加總力決戰的力量，雖只標明增加土產，而節約消費利用廢物的意義，也包括在裏。頭以上三項，是國民政府對于協力大東亞戰爭之工作重點。同時國民政府體認到戰爭即是建設之意味，在戰爭中，本着同甘同苦，同生共死的決心，與東亞同胞結成東亞同志，外則抵禦共同的敵人英·美粉碎其侵略　精神，與東亞同胞同心協力，擔當東亞之建設。就大東亞戰爭而論，我們所祈求的是勝利，就大東亞建設而論，我們所祈求的是共榮，具體說來，東亞各國家必須自愛其國，互愛其國，共愛東亞。就中國來說，我們的口號是復興中華，保衛東亞，為　是中國必須得到獨立自主，纔能有分担保衛束亞責任的能力，同時又必須東亞保術得佳，中國的獨立自主，綫能得到保障，所以我們要努力，把自巳國家作成一捆獨立自主的國家，同時要把自已國家作成東亞一個强有力的份子。</p>
<p>·團結一致創新天地·</p>
<p>東亞的國家。各有其木然之特質，所以要確保其獨立自主，同時還要互相尊重其燭立自主，東亞各國家又有共同的目的，所以又要同心協力，同　共同目的，以　致於共存共榮，先進國的日本，已將他獨立自主的光耀照總於世界，如今還要東亞各國都得到獨立自主，不惜加以援助，使之團結一致，向着共同目的而共同努力，我想政治上獨立自主得到之後，只要在外交上方針一致，在軍事上敵氣同仇，則共同目的必然可以達到。至於文化上，先進國的日本確已做到根據自已文化，昂揚東方文化，吸收世界文化三大要點，我們實在敬服，我深信各新興國家，必能奮力齊驅，而我中國更應以其全力·從事於文化之復興。文化的融洽　造，是各民族間親密團結之要素，學個例來說，印度和英國兩民族間，會經以佛教溝通其思想，而在東方文化史上放出一種異彩。至於經濟上，束亞各國家本於互患的基調，可以就長想相補，右無栩逝，想出種種兩利的方法，舉個們來說，英國的棉花是許多隣邦所需要的，而南洋各處的汽油，換皮，錫等也是可以供給許多隣邦，我們只要從互助着想，實在可以解決一切，把英美向來所挾特的榨取政漿，壟斷政策，根本予以消減，另河出一個合於人道的新天地。以上所說如能做到，嬌東亞各國家民族的福利有無窮無盡的增益，不惟東亞共榮得到確實保障，世界和平也必於此奠其基石，這些光明　在前途，只待我們東亞各國家民族手抵着手踏上前去。</p>
<p>·共榮圈的範圍擴大·</p>
<p>未了，達有幾句話，中國人民，在泰綫菲各國以及在日本佔領下的前英國所屬殖民地境內，總數不下七八百萬人，這些僑民，受着所在國政府的寬待與所在國人民駢肩工作，在交通開開上，資源啓發上，出了不少的心血和汗，這些心血和汗，一點一滴的與所在國人民凝結在一起，這於東亞人民自　是有極大的推動的。中國人民固有其缺點，但亦有共優點，和平，信實，勤勞，倫僕與所在國人民苦樂相共，休戚相關的結果，彼此採取優點，彌補缺點，巳成為不可分離的伙伴。鄧人深信經此次大束亞戰爭，必能更由　鍊臻於歷結，鄙人同時深信，對於大東亞共榮，必能有所日獻。迥憶民國二十九年十一月三十日，英日滿三國共同宣言，已經在東亞大陸樹立起軸心，如今大東亞會議得到泰·緬·菲三國參加及印度臨時政府主席列席，共榮圈的範圍更加擴大了，鄙人於申說所見之後，更以至誠視與會諸國的國運興隆，人民福祉。</p>

<h3>廣田課長談　莫斯科會議　斷定毫無效果</h3>
<p>中央社訉　日方在滬陸海外三當局主持之聯合報道常會，昨（五）下午三時在滙中飯店五樓術例舉行，日本大使館上海事務所由廣田情報課長，偕同福間副領事出席，艦報道部出席者到鹽田大尉，首由福間副領事向記者團介紹，並報吿鑒田此次晋昇大尉官階，全體出席記者乃相與慶賀，旋郞由廣田情報部長就此次英美蘇三國代表，在莫斯科舉行會談結果，發表重要談話，關述　詳，歷時二小時始畢。</p>
<p>文吿內容空洞異常</p>
<p>廣印部長首謂英美蘇三國莫斯科會談，終於十月三十日宣吿完事畢，就此次會談上而觀之，先後曾發表其同公報及宣言書、我人綜合結論戰之，其所發表之文告，空泛異常，更　施無聊宣傳，故我人詳細研究英美蘇三國此次會談，內容不切實際，無聊之至，是以我人感覺反軸心方面迭次舉行任何會議，均無多大價値，其結論更無效果可言。再按照所謂公報文吿予以檢討，此次會議所議決案件，績分為四點：其一，為英美蘇三國代表所組織之常設歐洲　詢委員會，地點設於倫敦（蓋反軸心取名以歐洲諮詢委員會者、則因前有地中海諮詢委員會之成立之故）一，其二·為關於遂行戰爭，應作之聚密協　。哭三，爲確立國際安全保障制度。其四，爲關於所佔領區域之協定。我人按照此四點而觀，在該公報之第二點遂行戰爭，應作聚密協調一項，後因事關作戰，未見發表詳細內容，其餘三點，在原則上觀之，似一致，實則可謂毫無特別決議，內容空洞異常</p>
<p>三國同盟破綻畢露</p>
<p>首以公報第三點。確立國際安全保障制度之詳細聲明書以觀，頗為簡單，在原則上似乎已趨一致，然我人在發表之所謂公報及宣言文吿。頗有不勝驚奇之感。此項簡單之問題，在彼車所討論之原則上，未見有獲得一最低之結論，故在英美蘇三國問，關見意見　　，頗不一致，當我人感覺所謂之共同目標作戰，應有再予檢討之必要。再觀第一點內所述之「組織常設歐洲諮訽委員會」之內容，原本英美蘇三國締結同盟，但各國大使常駐倫敦，彼此盡可隨時聯絡商榷任何問題，在此一點上面之，故對此所謂「常設歐洲路詢委員會」·實屬多餘，殊無組織之必要，如置有設立該會之需要，足見三國同盟之破綻畢露，反映聯絡不足之表現。</p>
<p>相互猜忌貌合神離</p>
<p>繼再就關於確立國際安全保障制度問題所述，參照彼等悄形而觀，成為歷史上之組織國際聯盟早已終了，一乃觀此確立國際安全保障制度。實關明有繼　　際聯盟之存在。余意此三國代表特在莫斯科舉行會議，無　多此一舉，果眞有需要商榷此項問題之必要，可以英美蘇三國問予以對國際聯盟盡應盡之義務，但其中猶有反對再建設國際戰盟之份子，次對第四點關遂在歐洲所佔領區之協定問題，已完全暴全權資本主義要佔領歐洲之野心，然在歐洲任何一民族，均不願反軸心佔領歐洲，此事實為極顯明之事實。同時英美蘇三國問彼此有猜疑忌防，即使能成立原則協定，而在此次會談上亦無特別意義，實為會議上留一汚點，尤以在公報中所云，關於檢之條欵上，已決定英美蘇三國同意，彼此均不容在各自領土內，彼此駐兵，而三國又無亞相信賴之一誠意，是以對此三點而觀，實　無特別重要意義，故英美蘇之關係，殊　可憐。旋廣田氏又稱：彼等雖名為同盟國家，在原則上似已趨向一致，實則貌合神，在根本立塲上絕未見一致，故三國同盟斷難一統，而莫斯科會談之一結是，不但毫無意義，抑且毫無價値可　。</p>
<p>歐洲登陸斷難成功</p>
<p>今就第二點遂行戰爭緊密協調問題，內容因未見詳細發表，故無從明瞭個中內基。但當會談終了後，英外長艾登即赴埃及開羅，與土外長曼里卓根　會該，故在我人觀測此項情形，則在彼輩之檢討作戰問題，已可明瞭。戰乎英笑兩國實力擬在法固領土登陸，進攻歐洲企圖，實為不可能，即擬　險作進攻中立性之利巴利亞半島，亦斷難獲取利益，更由後義大利阿爾卑斯山脈作進攻歐洲之舉，亦難以成功，放英美進攻歐洲之企　則在巴爾幹半島上陸較為可能。關於該項路綫，德國早已築有防禦堡亟，即使英美聯合進攻，亦斷難獲取效是，此為余可斷言者。英美如向巴島作登陸之舉，實非易事，然英美試行企圖之原因，則為蘇聯有農　英美陳錢及停止作戰之威脅，難英美進攻巴島自知力有未逮，但為緩和蘇聯關係起見，迫不得已接受蘇之要要求，以開　歐洲第二戰綫之約　，是以對蘇聯表示極大之讓步，並可謂對蘇政策之失敗。即使　　第二戰　成為事實，蘇戰在不久期問，即有感到莫大之失望，且在目前已透示不表現，故關於在此作戰上所謂之一切，其實完全暴露不和現象，余當謂之無異空中樓閣。故對此所發表之四點條件，內容實無特別　義　且空泛異常，故觀乎反軸心舉行之會講雖多，而商被問題所得之效果則等遂零。而後等亦逐漸　　矣。最後廣田氏謂日德兩國，在未打倒共問敵人之前，如經過作戰之變化，應仍爭取最後之勝利。</p>
<h3>市公債定期　還本抽</h3>
<p>上海特別市政府發行之民國三十一年上海特別市公債，於上年十一月及本年五日曾付息二次，按照該公債條　規定木年十一月三十日為首次還本，曁第三次付息之期，日前由該公債基金保管委員會開會議決，定於本月十五日假銀行公會五樓，舉行第一次還本抽籖，已分函各有關機關，屆時推派代表蒞傷監視，以昭鄭重。又悉該公債第一二兩次付息之際，尙有一部份息金迄未領去，現又屆第三期發息之時，各持票人可併往經付機關領取，（上海中央　術銀行，上海市復興銀行），　免日久損失。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>試拍</h3>
<p>華商證　交易所是上海經濟界的一個舞臺；華商體券交易所的舉令　術復　是體　舞臺的重行開　：可是，始而剪綵，繼而　　喧　　，終而劇中人無一上塲，致令千萬觀衆，眼欲穿，原來是劉院主持人鑒於戲劇之尙未　演熱，與其演出矣柄出來，使觀衆　個倒彩，自不如遲　揭幕，先行試演之為妥愼；就是電影，也是如此，未曾製片以先，必須舉行試拍，試拍時之主要條件，一方面為　演之指揮若定，絲毫不可，一方面為演員之聚精會神，循規蹈矩，而「循規蹈矩」尤為一切戲劇演員的一個金科玉律，否則舉止或則不合典型，或則失之過六，那末，這張影片，便不能獲到理想的成績了。</p>
<p>交開市以後如果先行試拍的話，則試拍期問的導演者為理事會或監察人，演員為各經紀人或代理人，劇本為經　査合格准予上市之華商股票，而　演章法則為　交　　細則。依照這樣一個假定，所以，理監事對於監督指導，務求嚴密精議，經紀人對於執行開拍，務求循規蹈矩，上市華商股票，不容其變化多端，證交營業細則，不容其形同具文。　而言之，試拍之　的，不僅在於演練開拍華股之步　與秩序，而尤在於試騐正式華商體券市塲之能否遵循通合時代的精，依着交易的正　以為經營，站在協助國民經濟的立塲以謀發展。逾限將予合併或停業</p>
<h3>資金不足額銀行　限年內增資　逾限將予合併或停業</h3>

<p>依照統計</p>
<p>本巿銀行有二百六十八家，資本　額為五〇三五·一二，一八三元，其申資本在五百萬元以上者三十一六，三百萬元以上者三十三一家，二百萬元以上者三十七家，一百萬元以上者三十八家，資本不足百萬者二十二家，是以在今年七月一年底之期問內</p>
<p>增資銀行</p>
<p>共達九十五家之多。餘一部份業已增足資金外，其餘正在趕辦增資手績中，其限期為十二月底止。按新規定銀行錢莊資本為六百萬元，實收三百萬元，普邇商業銀行並有信託部者、資本最低實收五百萬元，其中三百萬元為銀行部資金，二百萬元為信託部資金，如逾限尙未依法增足資金者，即予合併或勒令停業云。</p>
<h3>滬市金融機關　存款激增</h3>

<h3>滬西區行政的改善</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>本市第一，第三及滬西警察局，為完成大上海之建設而統一全市警政，自本月一日起已正式合倂。</p>
<p>這自然自一件使人興奮的事，可是大上海的統一並不只基於警政的統一，眞眞的統一還待行政的相輔而行，對於這一點。市民無不殷切期望當局的早日實行，這裏謹以滬西區居民的見地，貢獻一點意見：</p>
<p>保甲組織的强化——滬西區的保甲組織與警局一向很少聯携，因此戶口移動及死亡，出生的登記，市民常感受極大的不便。三月前，隔隣從北京搬來一家六口之家，如果他們搬在第一區，那麼市民證及口糧諸問題，大慨最多可以在十天內辦妥。可是攸們却在三月後的今日，旣沒右領到居　證，也沒右得到配給口糧的權利。他們為了爺於領取居什證，先向保長要求居住證申請書，保長說還沒有發下，叫他們　警局去領、到了警局，又叫向保長處拿，他們這樣地奔走保長與警局之間不下七八次之多，可是為了二者間的缺之聯絡，他們始終還沒有領到。這對於滬四區的居民不得不說是一種莫大的损失，尤其在過到演習的塲合下、一個沒有居住證的市民很容易被發生誤會。所以在全市警政統一聲中，希望當局對於滬西鼯保　與警局的關係右所改進，而改營最有效的措置無疑是酌最採納第一區旣右的優點。</p>
<p>改善配給制度——洲四區的計口授　是由南市　食局執行的，大約在月餘前，　食局為了强化配給機構，曾　戶抽查戶口一次，自此以後，新增戶口欲得口　必須携居住證至糧食管理局申請方可。此種制度本為嚴密而有效的措置。可是為了　西區領取居住證的既易，偉新增戶口每有無法申謂之感。所以希望有關當局對一於申請的方法有所改進，以管見所及，不妨由保甲長具保證明就可以了。這一點在第一區是早已實行了。至配給數量方面也右輿第一，第八兩區完全統一的必要。</p>
<p>上列兩點為滬西區居一民最亟於解決的二件事，希望賢明的一區當局注意及此。</p>
<h3>再論煤球利潤問題</h3>
<p>— 韋君</p>
<p>筆者曾於上月二十九日在本壇撰「關於煤球統制問題」一文，承示元君發表「讀關於煤球統制問題後」一文，加以駁覆，語重心長，惟宗元君未明眞相，僅據一般之傳說及普通常識之佔計成本，雖免有隔靴抓癢之　。</p>
<p>此次煤球恐慌，其主因實由於當局之减配煤膺。根據石炭聯合會配給數量：本年上半年與下半年四個月中之平均配給數幾成三與一之比，而七，八兩月與九，十兩月之配給量又成一·五輿一之比，試問際此煤球鴛求日盛之旺月，廠商得此稀少之原料，安得不起恐慌乎？</p>
<p>至於煤球廠商欲求增高價格，而為當局所否決，也許有其事實；而廠方藉口修理機件以减少產量為對付手段，僅為一時之現象。</p>
<p>關於　者前文所列之煤球製造成本分析表，實以每噸所含標準成分（百分之八十五煤屑，百分之二十五煤灰與黃泥合成）為原則。宗元君謂烘爐用煤及電力等，自去春迄今從未增價，且如煤屑及電力等反較前减價，誠如事實，但駁力運費以及工食，修理折響，事務費之幾驟增，却無容諱言地也是事實。</p>
<p>今就一般之統計將目前廠商製造煤球成本較精確地分析如下：</p>
<p>原料成本：山東煤屑（百分之三十）一〇九·五〇元，焦作煤屑（百分之五十五）一九八·〇〇元。運費及缺數七五·〇〇元，煤灰（百分之二十五）二五·〇〇元，黃泥（百分之二十五」一二·五〇元·</p>
<p>費用成本：烘煤「大汶口選炭以每噸製球五厘一計算之）三七。五〇元，水電七·八〇元·工食四八·〇〇元，利息八·〇〇元，修理折舊八〇·〇〇元，事務費四〇·〇〇元。廠商利潤二八·七〇元。</p>
<p>合計六七〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>駐：成本以每噸所含原料標準成分為原則（煤曾百分之八五，煤灰，黃泥百分之二五合成）。</p>
<p>依照上表最低估計價格，其純製造費需六四一·三元；如以每噸六七〇·〇〇元批與小賣商，則可得純利二八·七〇元。而現今每噸五五〇·〇〇元之批發限價，如與標準成分之煤球成本相較，則相查達九一·三元之鉅：試問際此唯利是圖之上海，何廠　願繼續生產？是故，除直接向當局要求增加價格而遭否決外，便將煤曾成分减少，煤灰黃泥六量增多，抑低品質以博微利；憮容否認，此為目前一般煤球廠商之普過情形。因此，近日市上購得之，確有天壤之別，而煤球廠商確也右其難言之隱</p>
<p>因此，筆者深盼常局對於廠商利潤能再予以合法之規定；而先決條件，必須將其出品能　合規定之標準，則於市民於廠商物得共利。</p>

<h3>Greater East Asia Conference</h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia Conference, which has attracted worldwide attention, began yesterday in Tokyo. News of this grand gathering was never revealed beforehand, which shows the calm and prudent attitude of the authorities of various countries, preparing to sincerely interact with each other, lay bare their beliefs, and earnestly discuss common goals and common problems. This is completely different in terms of sound and color from the so-called "Big Three Anglo-American-Soviet Conference" that had been clamoring for a long time, but ended in failure and was changed to a meeting of the foreign ministers of the three countries. Moreover, the "Three-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference" had just concluded amidst the Anglo-American cunning and the contradictions of sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams. The Great East Asia Conference, where we Asians are united as one, immediately opened its curtain. If it is said that the Great East Asia Conference was held to answer them, then overestimating them would be an inappropriate analogy. We can say that the Great East Asia Conference is a sincere discussion to complete common goals in an atmosphere of unity, using facts to shatter the deceit of the British and Americans. Therefore, the Greater East Asia Conference and the Three-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference are also completely different in terms of outcome.</p>
<p>This Greater East Asia Conference includes representatives from six independent countries—China, Japan, Thailand, Manchukuo, Burma, and the Philippines—and seven entities, including the Provisional Government of India. All are administrative heads who bear actual responsibility in their respective countries, making it an unprecedentedly important conference in history.</p>
<p>Since the allied nation of Japan advocated the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it has not hesitated to fight against Britain and the United States, because the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia are the biggest obstacles to the construction of a new order in East Asia, and they must be completely eradicated first. In the past two years, the forces of Britain and the United States have gradually been destroyed, and they have further assisted Burma and the Philippines in achieving independent nation-building, and the Provisional Government of India has been established, allowing the East Asian nations to completely break away from the aggressive shackles of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, and to liberate themselves. Furthermore, with Japan as the center, an allied front of various countries has been formed.</p>
<p>Thanks to the leadership and struggle of the allied nation of Japan, the ideal of Asia for Asians has now been fully realized. Therefore, the external form of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has in fact reached the highest ideal state. We believe that the direction of future efforts should not be how to form the outer shape of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, but how to consolidate the inner quality of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The main topic of this conference should also be this.</p>
<p>The formation of the outer shape of the Co-Prosperity Sphere is by no means easy. The allied nation of Japan has led the arduous task and devoted itself to it, which is especially evident to the people of East Asia. However, the consolidation of the inner quality of the Co-Prosperity Sphere is ten times more difficult and complex than the formation of the outer shape. If the inner quality is not consolidated, then the outer shape is particularly fragile. The preservation of the outer shape depends on the consolidation of the inner quality. How to consolidate the inner quality cannot be borne by Japan's independent strength alone. Each country has its own responsibilities. First, each country in the Co-Prosperity Sphere should stand on an equal footing of obligation and contribute its strength to consolidate the Co-Prosperity Sphere, but this is by no means a formal distribution, but an actual burden. Therefore, the strength of each country should be developed evenly, so that there is true and substantial cooperation. Second, each country should openly and frankly reveal its own weaknesses, and jointly discuss how to cooperate and strengthen them. Strengthening the strength of each country is strengthening the strength of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>In our editorial on May 1 this year, we put forward the "Expectation of the Pacific Charter." In order to build a new order in East Asia, in order to complete the independence and liberation of the countries and nations of the Pacific, unite and strive for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and achieve this goal, we urgently need a glorious banner—the Pacific Charter—to mobilize every East Asian to work hard. Secondly, after winning the victory, we need a fundamental law suitable for common requirements and common ideals—the Pacific Charter—to serve as a work guide for realizing the new order of Greater East Asia. This Greater East Asia Conference is undoubtedly the time to decide on the Pacific Charter.</p>
<p>In order to win the victory in the Greater East Asia War and in order to complete the construction of the new order in East Asia, we respectfully wish the Greater East Asia Conference a smooth and complete success!</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Greater East Asian Nations Grandly Held in Tokyo Awaiting the Swift Completion of the Great Undertaking of Reviving East Asia</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. After the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese alliance, the six countries of China, Japan, Thailand, Burma, and the Philippines have made great progress in liberating Asia and reviving East Asia. At the same time, the political machinery of the new order of Greater East Asia has also been completed. In order to quickly achieve this common goal, it is necessary for the countries to unite as one at this time, and to specifically declare to the world the ideals of Asia and the beliefs of Greater East Asia. Therefore, the government representatives of the six countries of China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, the Philippines, and Burma have decided to hold the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo recently. At that time, Kuntala Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, will also attend.

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Elected Chairman The Atmosphere of the Meeting Tense and Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. The Greater East Asia Conference has been solemnly held at the conference site here from today. Representatives of the six independent countries of China, Japan, Thailand, Manchukuo, the Philippines, and Burma, and the Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, gathered together, representing the general will of the billion people of Greater East Asia, and launched an unprecedented grand event in history. Inside the venue hung the national flags of various countries. All forty-six representatives and attendees from various countries arrived on time. The meeting started at 10:00 a.m. First, Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo delivered the opening speech, and then the election of the chairman was held. Prince Wan Waithayakon of Thailand proposed that Prime Minister Tojo, the representative of Japan, be elected as the chairman. As a result, the motion was unanimously passed. Then Chairman Tojo took the chair in the center, with Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government of our country, on his right, Zhang Jinghui, the Prime Minister of Manchukuo, and Ba Maw, the Prime Minister of Burma, on his left. On the left were Prince Wan Waithayakon, Advisor to the Prime Minister of Thailand, Laurel, the President of the Republic of the Philippines, and Kuntala Bose, the Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, all sitting side by side or facing each other. In addition, the attendees from various countries took their seats in the designated seats behind the representatives of their respective countries, and then entered the conference stage, sincerely stating their opinions on the fundamental strategy of completing the Greater East Asia War and building Greater East Asia, but only the representatives of each country were allowed to speak first. They spoke in order according to the assigned numbers of each country. In the morning, Japanese Imperial representative Prime Minister Tojo and Chinese representative President Wang of the Executive Yuan spoke successively. After a short break at noon, they had lunch together. The meeting resumed at 1:00 p.m., and then the representatives of Thailand, Manchukuo, the Philippines, and Burma spoke in order.

<h3>East Asian Nations Rise Up, Cooperate to Complete the War Main Points of Prime Minister Tojo's Speech</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. The main points of the speech delivered by Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo at the Greater East Asia Conference are as follows: In the past few centuries, the British Empire has acquired vast territories around the world through its policy of aggression and conquest, and wants to permanently maintain its superior position in various parts of the world, causing other countries to confront and fight each other. At the same time, the United States also took advantage of the turmoil in Europe to not only establish hegemony in the Americas, but also extended its hand to the Pacific and Asia by taking the Mexican-American War as an opportunity. Furthermore, taking the First World War as a turning point, it shared with Britain the ambition to jointly dominate the world. After the outbreak of this world war, the United States further coveted North Africa, Africa, the Atlantic, Australia, the Near East, and India, wanting to take the place of Britain. The so-called establishment of international justice and safeguarding world peace advocated by Britain and the United States is to promote the division and confrontation of European countries, so that the colonization and exploitation of Asian colonies can continue permanently, in order to maintain their selfish view of order.</p>
<p>British and American Policies: Aggression and Exploitation</p>
<p>The policies implemented by Britain and the United States towards Asia involve aggression in politics and exploitation in economics. Furthermore, under the guise of education, culture, etc., they cause various ethnic groups to lose their national character and conflict with each other in order to achieve their goals. Therefore, the survival of various countries and ethnic groups in Asia is constantly threatened, they lose a stable order, and the normal development of people's livelihood is hindered to this day. The open-door and equal-opportunity doctrine they call for is based on the fundamental concept of colonizing East Asia. This is actually a means they have adopted to achieve their non-hope of invading East Asia. Within their own territories, they often implement closed doors to various ethnic groups in East Asia, making opportunities unequal and hindering trade, only seeking the prosperity of their own interests. The ambition of Britain and the United States to dominate the world can be said to be a misfortune for mankind and the root of the world's troubles. Looking back, uprisings for liberation have constantly arisen among various countries and ethnic groups in East Asia. However, they were either suppressed by the violent force of Britain and the United States, or they failed due to their vicious divisive policies. Therefore, Japan's participation at this time is what Britain and the United States hate and fear the most. Therefore, they have always adopted a repressive attitude towards Japan, and at the same time schemed to divide Japan from the various countries and ethnic groups in East Asia. This is the essence of their East Asia policy.</p>
<p>Rising Up and Dealing for Survival</p>
<p>Because they want to maintain the enslaved state of East Asia, they regard the rise of any family in East Asia or the unity of various countries and ethnic groups in East Asia as unfavorable. In recent years, this kind of ambition of Britain and the United States to enslave East Asia has become increasingly blatant and dangerous. They instigated the Chongqing side to obstruct the diplomatic relations between China and Japan, and eventually caused the unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident, and used various means to try to hinder the resolution of the incident. After the outbreak of this European war, they used the excuse of the war to hinder the path of peaceful commerce, and then squeezed out an economic break that was essentially no different from war. At the same time, they strengthened their military equipment around East Asia, wanting to force our country to submit. At this point, the stability of East Asia was severely threatened. The Empire, regardless of this attitude of Britain and the United States, still tried to prevent the disaster from spreading to East Asia, and endured self-respect, wanting to resolve the situation through peaceful negotiations. However, Britain and the United States did not show any sign of introspection or mutual concession, but instead intensified their intimidation and oppression, bringing the Empire's survival to the brink of danger. In order to survive and defend itself, the Empire was finally forced to rise up. At this point, it confronted the evil forces that challenged East Asia, crushing everything that hindered it. In order to establish lasting peace in East Asia, it is moving towards the path of decisive battle. After the start of the Greater East Asia War, the Empire's army and navy, with their bravery and good fighting skills, drove the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States out of East Asia in less than half a year.</p>
<p>Full of Fighting Spirit with One Heart</p>
<p>The countries of Greater East Asia either declared war and fought side by side with the Empire, or closely cooperated to complete the war. Today, the self-awareness and enthusiasm of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia have filled the heavens and earth of Greater East Asia. Internally, they believe in each other and harmonize with each other. Externally, they destroy the counterattacks of Britain and the United States in order to seek self-survival and self-governance, so as to establish lasting stability in Greater East Asia. This war is a great decisive battle to improve the rise and fall, survival and death of the entire nation of Greater East Asia. Only by winning this war can the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia permanently ensure their survival in the heavens and earth of East Asia and share the joy of a co-prosperity land. The completion of the Greater East Asia War is the establishment of the new order of Greater East Asia. It is only natural that Britain and the United States will use their material and military strength to launch a counterattack against Greater East Asia. Therefore, today, the countries of Greater East Asia have all exerted their full strength to completely crush the counterattack of Britain and the United States, and further complete the war and ensure the stability of Greater East Asia. At this time, the Empire has stood in a favorable strategic position gained in the decisive battle and continues to implement its majestic operations. Domestically, in order to respond to this majestic operation, it is preparing the domestic situation. Recently, in order to make the domestic situation decisive, the people of the whole country have fought together with unwavering determination under the conviction of one hundred million hearts and a certain victory, and have been implementing the Greater East Asia War throughout. I am sure that the countries of Greater East Asia that you represent will also be determined to echo the Empire, exert their full strength to destroy Britain and the United States, and seek to permanently stabilize Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Basic Views on Building East Asia</p>
<p>Now, I would like to state the basic views of the Imperial Government on the construction of Greater East Asia. I am convinced that enabling all countries in the world to get what they deserve, supporting each other, and sharing the joy of co-prosperity with all nations is the most effective and practical way to establish world peace by establishing the foundations of each country, forming bands of co-existence and co-prosperity, and at the same time establishing harmonious and joyful relations with other countries. It is an undeniable fact that the countries of Greater East Asia have close relations in all aspects. Therefore, I am convinced that the countries of Greater East Asia will cooperate with each other in this relationship, ensure the stability of Greater East Asia, and build an order of co-existence and co-prosperity. This is the common mission of all countries. The order of co-existence and co-prosperity in Greater East Asia is based on the inherent moral spirit of Greater East Asia, which is fundamentally different from the old order of Britain and the United States. Because the old order of Britain and the United States is dedicated to their own prosperity, they do everything they can to deceive and exploit. The new construction of Greater East Asia, based on morality, has already been realized step by step during the war. But what about the British and American policies towards India?</p>
<p>Laying the Foundation for Indian Independence</p>
<p>Today, Britain's oppression of India has become increasingly fierce, and recently the United States has also harbored ambitions towards India. The conflict and alienation between them and the Indian people are becoming increasingly intensified. The suffering endured by the four hundred million people of India is beyond words. The unprecedented famine that occurred in India recently was also caused by Britain and the United States. This is something that even Britain and the United States themselves admit. Today, those with aspirations in India have all been imprisoned, and countless people are starving and living in despair. The tragedy is the greatest tragedy in the world and is a matter of common indignation to mankind. All the nations of Greater East Asia are indignant at the miserable situation in India, and at the same time, we cannot ignore this fact. At this time, Indian patriot Jiangtela Bose resolutely rose up, and people inside and outside India also rose up in response. This is how the establishment of the Provisional Government of India and the foundation of Indian independence were laid. The Empire has previously declared to China and foreign countries that the Empire is determined to provide all cooperation and support to India's struggle for independence. I am sure that the countries of Greater East Asia will also sincerely cooperate with India's struggle for independence. The policies taken by Britain and the United States towards India today are fundamentally different from what they proclaimed in the Atlantic Charter. To this day, they are really unable to justify their claims. However, we are not surprised to see their contradictory phenomena, because the world has long been accustomed to seeing the contradictions in the words and deeds of Britain and the United States, and knows that deception and disguise are the nature of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Increased Confidence in the Final Victory</p>
<p>No matter what the enemy wants to do, as long as the Empire and the countries of Greater East Asia cooperate and fight together, they will surely be able to liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and the United States. If the countries of Greater East Asia cooperate with each other, the revival and prosperity of Greater East Asia can be expected in the near future. Today, the countries and nations of Greater East Asia have united together to work together to realize the ideal of co-prosperity for all nations and build Greater East Asia. Looking back at the situation in Europe, the allied nation of Germany has strengthened national unity and is working hard to destroy Britain and the United States and build Europe with unwavering confidence, which is commendable. The Greater East Asia War is actually a holy war that reveals evil and demonstrates righteousness. The great righteousness is obvious, and our righteous army is invincible, so victory will eventually be ours. This is what we firmly believe. At this time, the Empire deeply expresses its respect for the great enthusiasm of the countries of Greater East Asia to wholeheartedly cooperate with the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, it expects the countries of Greater East Asia and the allied nations of Europe to strengthen their cooperation and deal with the increasingly fierce war situation, overcome all difficulties with unwavering confidence and indomitable fighting spirit, implement the Greater East Asia War, which is our common mission, and complete the construction of Greater East Asia, so as to contribute to the establishment of true world peace.</p>
<h3>Strong Unity of One Billion People A Landmark Page in East Asian History</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th. The Greater East Asia Conference, which aims to unite the billion people of East Asia, brought together responsible representatives from the six major countries of East Asia in Tokyo, Japan. It laid the foundation stone for the construction of East Asia and heralded the world's morality. It is not only a landmark page in East Asian history, but also unprecedented in world history. Just a week after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, when our country is deeply celebrating the completion of independence and autonomy, President Wang of the Executive Yuan is again visiting Tokyo with his entourage to attend the Greater East Asia Conference. He is meeting with the highest-ranking responsible personnel of the various countries and nations of East Asia to sincerely discuss the completion of the common war, the strengthening of East Asian unity, and the promotion of co-prosperity. Therefore, the legacy of the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism can be realized. Today, the countries of East Asia are each making close cooperation in their natural state and forming a strong cooperative axis. By fiercely attacking the Anglo-Americans who are clamoring for a counterattack, they can shatter their ambitions to invade East Asia again and completely break their dreams of dominating the world. The construction of Greater East Asia is based on Eastern morality and aims at the co-prosperity of East Asia, with the aim of establishing a cornerstone for world peace. Therefore, it can be said that the opening of the Greater East Asia Conference is enough to show the determination of the billion people of East Asia to unite as one, destroy the Anglo-Americans, complete the construction, and advance.</p>
<h3>Representative Wang's Speech in Japan Declares Our Government's Determination to Share the Responsibility of Completing the War and Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Wang Zhaoming, representative of the Republic of China, delivered a speech at the Greater East Asia Conference as follows: The Greater East Asia Conference, of great significance in world history, is being held today in the capital of our allied nation, Japan. Having just heard the speech by Prime Minister Tojo, I am greatly inspired. The British and Americans began their presence in East Asia centuries ago. In this critical period, thanks to Japan's military strength, as well as its political, economic, and cultural power, the aggressive ambitions of the British and Americans have been contained, ensuring that East Asia is not divided and occupied by them. Recently, Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, shattering the aggressive forces of the British and Americans in East Asia. Their naval and land bases in the Western Pacific and the South Seas have been successively defeated and occupied by the Japanese navy and army. Japan has gone further, based on the spirit of benevolent hegemony, advocating the coexistence and co-prosperity of the various East Asian nations, assisting them in achieving independence and autonomy, fulfilling their patriotic aspirations, enabling them to fulfill their roles and exert their utmost efforts to share the responsibility of completing the Greater East Asia War and the construction of Greater East Asia. I express my greatest respect for Japan's noble and great aspirations and its brilliant achievements. At the same time, I extend my greatest respect to our long-standing friendly nations of Manchukuo and Thailand, as well as the newly emerging nations of Burma and the Philippines, and the Provisional Government of India, for their firm determination and vigorous efforts to share the responsibility of the Greater East Asia War and the construction of Greater East Asia. The Republic of China, as a member of East Asia, is truly honored to have this opportunity to express the National Government's determination and efforts regarding the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the direction of Greater East Asia's construction.</p>
<p>Breaking the Shackles of Aggressive Forces</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, had a lifelong aspiration to enable China and East Asia to break the shackles of British and American aggressive forces and achieve independence and autonomy. Based on this aspiration, he struggled throughout his life until his death forty years ago. In the month or so before his death, he gave two speeches in Kobe, Japan. One was on November 28th of the 13th year of the Republic (1924), speaking about Pan-Asianism. In this speech, he explained that Asia is the birthplace of the most ancient cultures. However, in the last hundred years, it has been invaded by the British and Americans, gradually weakening, with almost no completely independent nations. However, at the extreme of weakness, a turning point suddenly appeared, which was the Meiji Restoration of Japan. The Meiji Restoration is the reason why Japan became an advanced nation in Asia and is also the cornerstone of Asia's revival. Asian nations should work together with Japan, an advanced nation, based on Eastern Wangdao culture, to defeat the Western hegemonic culture, completely drive out the aggressive forces of the British and Americans, and achieve the independence and autonomy of Asian nations through the unity of Asian nations. Only in this way can the entire Asia be transformed from decline to revival. Another speech, also given in the same year on a certain day of a certain month, was about Japan's abolition of unequal treaties with China. In this speech, he explained that China and Japan are like brothers. Japan had previously been subjected to the shackles of unequal treaties, but through vigorous self-improvement, it was able to break these shackles and become an advanced nation in the East and a powerful nation in the world. China is now also struggling to abolish unequal treaties and hopes that Japan will vigorously assist in China's liberation, which is also the liberation of Asia. The above two speeches were the last speeches of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in his life. After that, Dr. Sun Yat-sen fell ill in bed and eventually passed away in Beijing on March 12th of the following year. At the time of his death, he left a will to his comrades, asking them to continue to struggle based on this will in order to see the day of success. Unfortunately, after the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, his will was not realized. The relationship between China and Japan not only did not improve but deteriorated day by day, and finally, the incident occurred in July of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), twelve years after the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>Soldiers and People Will Eventually Return</p>
<p>At this time, the discord between China and Japan was seen by the British and Americans as the best opportunity to sow discord, fearing that the Sino-Japanese incident would not expand or prolong. Our comrades saw that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will had not been realized and that the relationship between China and Japan was deteriorating day by day, and they were extremely saddened, almost falling into the abyss of despair. Fortunately, the Japanese government soon announced its policy of ending the incident, stating that Japan's goal was not the destruction of China but the prosperity of China, and that Japan expected China to share the responsibility of building East Asia. Japan also resolved to assist China in fulfilling its wish for independence and autonomy. Our comrades, hearing Japan's true intentions, knew that there was still hope for improving Sino-Japanese relations and realizing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will. Therefore, they first advised the Chongqing authorities to abandon resistance and restore peace. When their advice was not heeded, they were forced to leave Chongqing and work for the peace movement. Finally, the National Government returned to Nanjing, openly advocating Sino-Japanese cooperation and making the greatest efforts to revive East Asia together. As mentioned above, the British and Americans sowed discord in the Sino-Japanese incident with the intention of expanding and prolonging it. Since the return of the National Government to Nanjing, these means have become even more intensified. The British and Americans have used every possible means to entice Chongqing to resist and obstruct peace. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and Americans, in view of the setbacks and disappearance of their power in East Asia, have become even more eager to use Chongqing to contain Japan. This is a fact known to the world. However, our government is certain that the British and Americans' attempt will surely fail. Why? Because both the soldiers and the people in Chongqing adhere to the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Since January 9th of this year, Japan has returned concessions to China in advance, abolished extraterritoriality, and, in particular, recently replaced the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty with the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and abolished all attached documents. The Pan-Asianism advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen has seen the light. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's hope that Japan would assist China in abolishing unequal treaties has become a reality. Even if the British and Americans entice and obstruct in every way, they will not be able to stop Chongqing's awakening. Even if they are temporarily restrained, Chongqing will one day realize that relying on the British and Americans is a betrayal of East Asia and a betrayal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Both the soldiers and the people will eventually have a day of returning, and this can be determined.</p>
<p>Ensuring Security and Increasing Production</p>
<p>During this most critical period, the National Government can only affirm its consistent policy and intensify its efforts, on the one hand, to promote the awakening and return of the soldiers and people in Chongqing to complete unification, and on the other hand, to establish a model in the areas where political power can reach. Its work has about three key points: First: rectifying thought, second: ensuring security, and third: increasing production. The so-called rectifying thought is to thoroughly eliminate the ideology of British and American individualism and utilitarianism and replace it with the Eastern spirit of morality, focusing on the goals of East Asians and restoring the original appearance of East Asians, striving with one heart and one mind for the coexistence and co-prosperity of East Asians. The so-called ensuring security is to recognize that the rear area of the Greater East Asia War must be secure so that the frontline soldiers of the allied nations have no worries and can further transport troops to the front lines, sharing the hardships of the allied soldiers. The so-called increasing production is to give all economic and financial plans a focus, increasing the power of the decisive battle. Although it only emphasizes increasing local products, it also includes the meaning of conserving consumption and utilizing waste. The above three items are the key points of the National Government's work in cooperating with the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, the National Government recognizes the meaning of war as construction. In the war, with the determination to share weal and woe, and to live and die together, it forms East Asian comrades with East Asian compatriots, resisting the common enemy of the British and Americans and shattering their aggressive spirit, and cooperating with East Asian compatriots to undertake the construction of East Asia. Regarding the Greater East Asia War, what we seek is victory. Regarding the construction of Greater East Asia, what we seek is co-prosperity. Specifically, each East Asian nation must love its own country, love each other's countries, and love East Asia together. As for China, our slogan is to revive China and defend East Asia, because China must achieve independence and autonomy in order to have the ability to share the responsibility of defending East Asia, and at the same time, East Asia must be well-defended so that China's independence and autonomy can be guaranteed. Therefore, we must strive to make our own country an independent and autonomous country and at the same time make our own country a strong member of East Asia.</p>
<p>Unite and Create a New World</p>
<p>The countries of East Asia each have their natural characteristics, so it is necessary to ensure their independence and autonomy, and at the same time respect each other's independence and autonomy. The countries of East Asia also have a common goal, so they must work together with one heart and one mind towards a common goal in order to achieve coexistence and co-prosperity. Japan, an advanced nation, has already shone the light of its independence and autonomy on the world, and now it is willing to assist all East Asian countries in achieving independence and autonomy, uniting them and working together towards a common goal. I believe that after political independence and autonomy are achieved, as long as the diplomatic policies are consistent and the military shares the same hatred of the enemy, the common goal will surely be achieved. As for culture, advanced Japan has indeed achieved the three key points of basing itself on its own culture, promoting Eastern culture, and absorbing world culture. We truly admire this. I firmly believe that all emerging countries will be able to strive together, and China should devote all its efforts to the revival of its culture. Cultural harmony and creation are essential for close unity among nations. For example, Buddhism once communicated the ideas between India and Britain, shining a unique light in the history of Eastern culture. As for the economy, the countries of East Asia can complement each other based on the principle of mutual benefit, and there are endless ways to find mutually beneficial methods. For example, British cotton is needed by many neighboring countries, and gasoline, rubber, tin, etc. from various parts of the South Seas can also be supplied to many neighboring countries. As long as we think from the perspective of mutual assistance, we can really solve everything, fundamentally reducing the exploitation policies and monopoly policies that the British and Americans have always relied on, and creating a new world that is in line with humanity. If the above can be achieved, the welfare of the countries and nations of East Asia will have endless benefits. Not only will the co-prosperity of East Asia be effectively guaranteed, but world peace will also be laid on this foundation. These bright prospects are ahead, waiting for the countries and nations of East Asia to step forward hand in hand.</p>
<p>Expanding the Scope of the Co-prosperity Sphere</p>
<p>Finally, I have a few words. Chinese people in Thailand, the Philippines, and in the former British colonies occupied by Japan total no less than seven or eight million. These overseas Chinese are treated kindly by the governments of the host countries and work shoulder to shoulder with the people of the host countries, putting in a lot of effort and sweat in transportation development and resource development. This effort and sweat is integrated with the people of the host countries bit by bit, which has a great promotion for the people of East Asia. The Chinese people have their shortcomings, but they also have their strengths. Peace, honesty, diligence, and ethics, sharing the joys and sorrows with the people of the host countries, the result of sharing weal and woe, adopting each other's strengths, and making up for each other's shortcomings have become inseparable partners. I firmly believe that through this Greater East Asia War, it will be more tempered and perfected. I also firmly believe that it will be able to contribute to the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere day by day. Recalling the joint declaration of Japan, Manchuria, and Thailand on November 30, 29th year of the Republic (1940), it has already established an axis on the East Asian continent. Now, the Greater East Asia Conference has the participation of Thailand, Burma, and the Philippines, and the chairman of the Provisional Government of India is attending. The scope of the Co-prosperity Sphere has further expanded. After stating my views, I sincerely wish the participating countries prosperity and the people happiness.</p>

<h3>Anglo-American-Turkish Conference, Germany Pays Special Attention, Turkish President's Speech Is Thought-Provoking</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a German news agency, the Turkish Foreign Minister's trip to Cairo will involve not only talks with British Foreign Secretary Eden, but also the participation of U.S. Secretary of State Hull, according to recent news. The British and American public believe this will guide major decisions and is closely related to the Moscow Conference. The Turkish press emphasizes Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu's trip, considering it to be of an informal nature. The Daily Express's comments clearly express Britain's attitude, stating that if the anti-Axis forces have the right to use Turkish air bases and pass through the Dardanelles, the war will enter another stage and shorten the war by several months. The Daily Mail said that Turkey will provide the anti-Axis powers with some facilities to attack major parts of Europe, just like the former Hague provided the Azores to Britain. The Daily Express also hinted that Turkey would be pressured and threatened to strengthen its power, and it is not known whether it will stop supplying Turkey with weapons and ammunition. However, how Turkey will react to actions that trap it in sin remains to be seen in the future. Political circles in the capital are closely watching the differing assessments between Britain, the United States, and Turkey regarding the purpose of the Turkish Foreign Minister's trip to Rome, and President İsmet's recent speech that Turkey will maintain its neutrality at any cost is also valued by Germany.</p>

<h3>Section Chief Hirota Discusses the Moscow Conference - Determines No Effect</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The joint press conference hosted by the Japanese Land, Sea, and Overseas Authorities in Shanghai was held as usual yesterday (5th) at 3:00 p.m. on the fifth floor of the Huizhong Hotel. Hirota, the information section chief of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, ​​attended with Vice-Consul Fukuma. Lieutenant Ogiwara attended from the Naval Reporting Department. First, Vice-Consul Fukuma introduced the reporter group and reported that Ogiwara had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and all the reporters present congratulated him. Then, Hirota, the head of the Information Department, made an important speech on the results of the meeting held in Moscow by the representatives of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The detailed explanation lasted two hours before it ended.</p>
<p>The Content of the Announcement Is Extremely Empty</p>
<p>Minister Hirota first said that the Moscow conference of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, finally announced its conclusion on October 30. From the point of view of this conference, it has successively issued its joint communiqué and declaration. After our comprehensive conclusion of the war, the announcements it issued are extremely empty, and even more useless propaganda. Therefore, after our detailed study of the conference of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the content is unrealistic and extremely boring. Therefore, we feel that any meetings held repeatedly on the anti-Axis side are of little value, and their conclusions are even more ineffective. Then, according to the so-called communiqué announcement, the cases discussed at this conference can be divided into four points: First, the permanent European Advisory Committee organized by the representatives of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, is located in London (the anti-Axis powers named it the European Advisory Committee because of the establishment of the Mediterranean Advisory Committee). Second, close coordination should be made regarding the execution of the war. Third, to establish an international security system. Fourth, an agreement on the occupied areas. When we look at these four points, in the second point of the communiqué, the item that close coordination should be made in the execution of the war, since it concerns the war, no detailed content has been published. The remaining three points seem to be consistent in principle, but in fact they can be said to have no special resolutions, and the content is extremely empty.</p>
<p>The Alliance of the Three Countries Is Full of Flaws</p>
<p>First, let's look at the detailed statement of the third point of the communiqué, "Establish an International Security System," which is quite simple. In principle, it seems to have reached a consensus, but we are quite surprised by the so-called communiqué and declaration announcements issued. On the principle that this simple issue was discussed at their meeting, no minimum conclusion was reached. Therefore, there are considerable differences of opinion among the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. We feel that it is necessary to re-examine the so-called common goal of fighting the war. Looking at the content of the "Organization of the Permanent European Advisory Committee" mentioned in the first point, the original three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, concluded an alliance, but the ambassadors of each country are stationed in London and can contact each other at any time to discuss any issues. From this point of view, the so-called "Permanent European Advisory Committee" is superfluous and there is no need to organize it. If there is a need to establish the council, it shows that the alliance of the three countries is full of flaws, reflecting the lack of communication.</p>
<p>Mutual Suspicion, Discord in Appearance</p>
<p>Next, regarding the issue of establishing an international security system, referring to their situation, the Organization of the League of Nations has long ended in history. Today, this establishes an international security system, in fact, obviously following the existence of the League of Nations. I think that the representatives of these three countries specially held a meeting in Moscow, which is superfluous. If there is really a need to discuss this issue, the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, can fulfill their obligations to the League of Nations, but there are still elements among them who oppose rebuilding the International War Alliance. Secondly, regarding the agreement on the occupied areas in Europe in the fourth point, it has completely exposed the ambition of the capitalist powers to occupy Europe, but any nation in Europe does not want the anti-Axis powers to occupy Europe. This fact is extremely clear. At the same time, there is suspicion and distrust among the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Even if a principle agreement can be reached, it is of no special significance at this meeting and is really a stain on the meeting. Especially what is said in the communiqué regarding the clause of examination, it has been decided that the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, agree that they will not allow each other to station troops in their respective territories, and the three countries do not have the sincerity to trust each other. Therefore, looking at these three points, there is no special important meaning, so the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is really pathetic. Then, Hirota said again: Although they are nominally allied countries, in principle they seem to be moving towards unity, but in fact they are in discord in appearance, and they have never been unified in their fundamental position. Therefore, the alliance of the three countries is difficult to unify, and the conclusion of the Moscow conference is not only meaningless, but also of no value. Then they will gradually see it. Finally, Hirota said that before defeating the common enemy, Japan and Germany should still strive for the final victory after the changes in the war.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bonds to Be Redeemed and Drawn on Schedule</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Bonds issued by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government in 1942 have paid interest twice in November of last year and May 5th of this year. In accordance with the regulations of the bonds, November 30th of this year is the date for the first redemption and the third interest payment. The Bond Fund Management Committee recently held a meeting and decided to hold the first redemption lottery on the 15th of this month on the fifth floor of the Bankers Association. Notices have been sent to the relevant authorities, and representatives will be dispatched to supervise the scene at that time to show seriousness. It is also learned that when the first and second interest payments of the bonds were made, some of the interest payments had not yet been collected. Now that the third interest payment period is approaching, the bondholders can go to the paying institutions (Shanghai Central Trust Bank, Shanghai Fuxing Bank) to collect them together to avoid long-term losses.</p>
<p>Economic Circle Comments</p>
<h3>Trial Filming</h3>
<p>The Chinese Merchants' Exchange is a stage for Shanghai's economic circles. The reopening of the Chinese Merchants' Securities Exchange is the resumption of activities on that stage. However, from the initial ribbon-cutting to the subsequent noise and excitement, none of the actors took to the stage, causing millions of viewers to strain their eyes in anticipation. It turned out that the host, Director Liu, believed that the drama was not yet ready for performance. Rather than staging a performance that would be met with boos, it was better to delay the premiere and conduct a trial run first. The same principle applies to movies. Before producing a film, a trial shoot must be conducted. The main conditions for a trial shoot are, on the one hand, that the director's command is decisive and flawless, and on the other hand, that the actors are focused and disciplined. "Discipline" is a golden rule for all dramatic actors. Otherwise, if their behavior is not typical or excessive, the film will not achieve the desired results.</p>
<p>If a trial shoot is conducted before the exchange opens, the directors during the trial period will be the directors and supervisors, the actors will be the brokers or agents, the script will be the Chinese stocks that have been approved for listing after investigation, and the acting rules will be the detailed regulations of the exchange. According to this hypothetical scenario, the directors and supervisors must be rigorous and precise in their supervision and guidance, the brokers must be disciplined in executing the opening, the listed Chinese stocks must not be allowed to change erratically, and the exchange's business regulations must not be allowed to become mere formalities. In short, the purpose of the trial shoot is not only to rehearse the steps and order of opening the Chinese stock market, but also to test whether the formal Chinese Merchants' Securities Market can adhere to the spirit of the times, operate according to the principles of trading, and develop from a position of assisting the national economy.</p>
<h3>Banks with Insufficient Capital Must Increase Capital Within the Year; Failure to Do So Will Result in Merger or Closure</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, in order to effectively implement financial control policies and rectify economic institutions, has recently issued a circular to banks with insufficient capital, requiring them to increase their capital in accordance with the new regulations within one and a half months. If they still fail to increase their capital by the end of this year, they will be given appropriate penalties, and in serious cases, they may be ordered to close down.</p>
<p>According to statistics,</p>
<p>there are 268 banks in this city with a total capital of 50,351,218.3 yuan. Among them, 36 have a capital of 5 million yuan or more, 31 have a capital of 3 million yuan or more, 37 have a capital of 2 million yuan or more, 38 have a capital of 1 million yuan or more, and 22 have a capital of less than 1 million yuan. Therefore, within the period from July to the end of this year,</p>
<p>the number of banks increasing their capital</p>
<p>has reached as many as 95. In addition to the fact that some have already increased their capital, the rest are rushing to complete the procedures for increasing their capital, with a deadline of the end of December. According to the new regulations, the capital of banks and native banks is 6 million yuan, with 3 million yuan paid up. General commercial banks with trust departments must have a minimum paid-up capital of 5 million yuan, of which 3 million yuan is for the banking department and 2 million yuan is for the trust department. If they fail to increase their capital in accordance with the law by the deadline, they will be merged or ordered to close down.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Deposits in Shanghai's Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>Since the National Government implemented wartime economic policies, the various industrial and commercial organizations in this city have been undergoing overall consolidation, which has been entirely completed. The degree of material unification has reached a new level, and the use of funds has become more active. The business dynamics and capital flows of financial and various industrial and commercial institutions (including banks, native banks, and trust companies) are more prosperous than in the past. In particular, after the guidance of practical work, there has been much improvement. It is reported that, to date, the deposit and loan businesses of various financial institutions have increased by more than double compared to before, and the reason for this is that they all emphasize investing in production and construction projects.</p>
<h3>Stock Trading on the Exchange Temporarily Limited to Spot Transactions</h3>
<p>Supervisory Committee Sends Personnel to Monitor</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Merchants' Exchange, after holding a resumption ceremony on September 29, has been actively preparing for the layout of the market. Now that the major affairs have been completed, it has been decided that formal trading will begin on the 8th of this month. A total of 108 types of listed stocks have been approved by the Exchange Supervisory Committee. According to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Exchange, the Ministry of Industry has already issued business licenses to 29 brokerage firms, allowing them to enter the market for trading at that time. The applications of 71 more brokerage firms are being processed and will be issued successively to allow them to operate. The market now has 200 pairs of telephones for brokers, which can be fully installed by tomorrow or the day after. Stock trading starting on the 8th will be temporarily limited to spot transactions. During the trading period, the Supervisory Committee will also send personnel to monitor the market to prevent speculative and illegal trading activities.</p>
<h3>Non-Industry Personnel Not Allowed to Enter Trade Association Markets</h3>
<p>Recently, it has often been discovered in various trade associations in this city that non-industry personnel are混入into various markets, engaging in black market buying and selling or lending outside the scope of permitted activities. This situation not only disrupts market order, but also has a significant impact on the market. Therefore, various trade associations have specifically stipulated that in the future, personnel entering the market must present a membership card or entry permit. At the same time, members must absolutely abide by the association's charter and the laws and regulations promulgated by the government when trading in the market. Members who violate the law will, once discovered, be expelled from the market and have their membership revoked.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The second and third issues of China's Economy for two months have been published on the first of this month. They include discussions on monetary policy, the spirit of Japanese industry during wartime, Chen Jizhi's analysis of the background and impact of purchasing cloth, Jian Shu's analysis of wartime economic trends in various countries. Starting next year, it will be changed to a monthly publication.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks rose first and then traded sideways. Because of the stock market, the confidence of all parties is increasing, and new stocks are being proposed more vigorously. There is a lot of buying activity. Fuxing and Jinglun socks, Jiu'an Industrial, China Film, and Standard MSG are all being raised by major players, resulting in significant increases. Most department stores, such as Wing On Company, and stocks such as Wing On Textile, are seeing less momentum. Buying interest in the new medicine industry gradually intensified at noon. Stocks in industries such as real estate are all making upward progress. The tobacco company alone saw weakness. Trading was quite active throughout the day. The shares of each industry are listed below.</p>
<p>Textiles: Wing On Textile rose to Guandong, but quickly fell back, ultimately rising slightly compared to the previous day. Rongde Textile continued to see significant trading volume in buying activity, rising half a Guan. Zhongfang and Xinhe traded sideways. Meiya also saw a slight increase. Lunhua Dagong also saw strong bidding. Tianlun Xinfeng and other textile stocks saw higher prices. Hongsheng Weaving remained flat. Jingfu Socks rose significantly above the face value. Zuilun also rose. China Silk also saw buying activity.</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On Company fell back after Guan, ultimately trading flat with Sincere and National Goods Company. Underwear also rose and then returned to flat.</p>
<p>New Medicines: Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory rose and fell quickly in the morning, ultimately trading flat. After 11 o'clock, buyers immediately pushed it up. In the afternoon, it gradually rose to a level outside Da Guan, ultimately rising half a Guan. Zhongfa followed suit. Xinyi and Xinxing Pharmaceutical Factory also saw an increase. Wuzhou Zhongsi and Jiufu Pharmaceutical all saw price parity.</p>
<p>Finance: Dalu Bank continued to trade at new highs. Shanghai Zhejiang Xing's price was also very firm. Tongyi Trust rose and then returned to flat. Jin Cheng Salt Industry and Yixin Trust saw little change in bidding.</p>
<p>Culture: Commercial Press and China Bookstore gradually advanced towards higher prices. World remained flat.</p>
<p>Real Estate: Lianhua and Xinyi Real Estate both saw slight increases. Yongxing was slightly weaker.</p>
<p>Public Utilities: It is said that Wenbei Hydropower saw a slight increase in Guandong. China Electric Power's bidding remained flat.</p>
<p>Industry: Dachunghua Firecracker saw a slight increase. Huacheng and Nanyang Tobacco Company</p>
<p>both saw declines. Jiu'an Industrial continued to rise in buying activity. Xinya Construction returned to more than double the face value. Buying interest was also strong. China and Guohua Investment remained stable. Datong Business was also flat. Kangyuan Manufacturing broke out of Guan significantly. Standard MSG rose gradually in the afternoon buying spree, making it difficult to obtain. Meilin Canned Food fell back. However, Shengchang saw higher prices. Sanyou Industrial and Baoan Glass also saw strength.</p>
<h3>Commercial Summary</h3>
<p>The public bond market was even less active yesterday, with declines increasing. This is because the stock market will open next week, and public bonds will have no place. Whether off-exchange trading will continue as usual is still uncertain. Bing bonds were initially firm, but later the supply completely exceeded demand, and the market situation gradually declined. In the end, it fell significantly compared to the previous day. The other four types, A, B, D, and E, remained flat, which was very different from the stability of Bing bonds. This is because Bing bonds still have futures trading, which is why they fell sharply first. The interbank call rate remains at 1.5 cents, unchanged by the Money Industry Association.</p>

<h3>Improvement of Administration in the Western District of Shanghai</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The First, Third, and Western Shanghai Police Bureaus of this city have been officially merged since the first of this month to complete the construction of Greater Shanghai and unify the city's police administration.</p>
<p>This is naturally an exciting event. However, the unification of Greater Shanghai is not only based on the unification of police administration. True unification also requires the complement of administration. Regarding this point, the citizens are all eagerly expecting the authorities to implement it as soon as possible. Here, from the perspective of the residents of the Western District of Shanghai, we offer some opinions:</p>
<p>Strengthening the Baojia Organization – The Baojia organization in the Western District of Shanghai has always had little connection with the police bureau. Therefore, citizens often experience great inconvenience in registering household movements, deaths, and births. Three months ago, a family of six moved from Beijing next door. If they had moved into the First District, then issues such as citizen certificates and food rations could probably have been completed within ten days at most. However, today, three months later, they have neither received a residence permit nor the right to receive food rations. In order to receive a residence permit, they first asked the Baozhang for a residence permit application form. The Baozhang said that it had not been issued yet and told them to go to the police bureau to get it. When they got to the police bureau, they were told to get it from the Baozhang. They ran back and forth between the Baozhang and the police bureau no less than seven or eight times, but because of the lack of communication between the two, they still have not received it. This is undoubtedly a great loss for the residents of the Fourth District of Shanghai, especially in the event of an exercise. A citizen without a residence permit can easily be misunderstood. Therefore, in the midst of the unification of the city's police administration, we hope that the authorities will improve the relationship between the Baojia and the police bureau in the Western District of Shanghai. The most effective measure to improve is undoubtedly to adopt the existing advantages of the First District.</p>
<p>Improve the Rationing System – The rationing of food in the Fourth District of Shanghai is implemented by the Nanshi Food Bureau. About a month ago, the Food Bureau conducted a household census in order to strengthen the rationing mechanism. Since then, new households wishing to obtain food rations must bring their residence permit to the Food Administration to apply. This system is originally a strict and effective measure. However, because it is easy to obtain a residence permit in the Western District of Shanghai, new households often feel unable to apply. Therefore, we hope that the relevant authorities will improve the application method. As far as we can see, it may be possible to have the Baojia chief guarantee the proof. This point has already been implemented in the First District. It is also necessary to completely unify the rationing quantity with the First and Eighth Districts.</p>
<p>The above two points are the two most urgent issues for the residents of the Western District of Shanghai to solve. We hope that the wise authorities of the First District will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>A Further Discussion on the Coal Briquette Profit Issue</h3>
<p>— Wei Jun</p>
<p>The author wrote an article in this forum on the 29th of last month entitled "On the Issue of Coal Briquette Control." Chen Shi Yuanjun published an article entitled "After Reading 'On the Issue of Coal Briquette Control'" in response, with earnest words. However, Zong Yuanjun did not understand the truth, relying only on general rumors and common-sense estimates of costs, which inevitably scratched an itch without getting to the point.</p>
<p>The main reason for this coal briquette panic is actually due to the authorities' reduction in coal allocation. According to the allocation quantity of the Coal Association: the average allocation quantity in the first half of this year is almost three to one compared to the four months in the second half of the year. The allocation quantity in July and August is also 1.5 to 1 compared to September and October. During this peak month when the demand for coal briquettes is increasing, how can manufacturers not panic when they obtain such scarce raw materials?</p>
<p>As for the fact that coal briquette manufacturers wanted to increase prices but were rejected by the authorities, perhaps there is some truth to it. However, the manufacturers' use of the excuse of repairing machinery to reduce production as a countermeasure is only a temporary phenomenon.</p>
<p>Regarding the coal briquette manufacturing cost analysis table listed in the previous article, it is based on the principle of each ton containing standard ingredients (85% coal dust, 25% coal ash and yellow mud). Zong Yuanjun said that the coal and electricity used in the furnace have not increased in price since last spring, and that coal dust and electricity have even decreased in price compared to before. This is indeed true. However, the sharp increase in the cost of shipping and labor, repair depreciation, and administrative expenses cannot be denied and is also a fact.</p>
<p>Based on general statistics, a more accurate analysis of the current cost of manufacturing coal briquettes by manufacturers is as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Material Cost: Shandong coal dust (30%) 109.50 yuan, Jiaozuo coal dust (55%) 198.00 yuan. Freight and shortage 75.00 yuan, coal ash (25%) 25.00 yuan, yellow mud (25%) 12.50 yuan.</p>
<p>Expense Cost: Coal baking (Daventaikou coal is calculated at 5% per ton of briquettes) 37.50 yuan, water and electricity 7.80 yuan, labor and food 48.00 yuan, interest 8.00 yuan, repair depreciation 80.00 yuan, administrative expenses 40.00 yuan. Manufacturer's profit 28.70 yuan.</p>
<p>Total 670.00 yuan</p>
<p>Note: The cost is based on the principle of standard ingredient raw materials per ton (coal is 85%, coal ash and yellow mud are 25%).</p>
<p>According to the lowest estimated price in the above table, the net manufacturing cost is 641.3 yuan. If it is wholesaled to small retailers at 670.00 yuan per ton, a net profit of 28.70 yuan can be obtained. However, compared with the cost of coal briquettes with standard ingredients, the current wholesale limit price of 550.00 yuan per ton is a difference of 91.3 yuan. In Shanghai, where profit is the only goal, what manufacturer is willing to continue production? Therefore, in addition to directly requesting the authorities to increase prices and being rejected, they will reduce the coal content, increase the amount of coal ash and yellow mud, and lower the quality to gain a small profit. It is undeniable that this is the common situation of general coal briquette manufacturers today. Therefore, the quality of coal briquettes purchased in the market these days is indeed very different, and coal briquette manufacturers do have unspeakable difficulties.</p>
<p>Therefore, the author deeply hopes that the authorities can re-legislate the profits of manufacturers. The prerequisite is that the products can meet the prescribed standards, so that both citizens and manufacturers can obtain common benefits.</p>
