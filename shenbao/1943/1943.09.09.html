<h3>參戰八個月的反省</h3>
<p>今年一月九日，國民政府佈告對英美宜戰，此後每月九日定爲參戰紀念日，爲提高敵愾情緒，促起民衆警覺，每逢紀念日，輙將參戰佈吿，在各報重覆公布。今天是第九次見到這布吿，也就是從參戰到今天，已經整整的八個月了。在宣戰怖吿中特別鄭重的說：「自今日起，對英美處氏戰爭狀態，當悉其全力，與友邦日本協力，一掃英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放。」如果大家確能每次讀這佈吿，那末，對於這幾句話一定可以銘記於心，不會熟視無睹吧！</p>
<p>在我們的理想，參戰以後，尤其經過八個月之久，國內一般情况，必定能够做到下列幾點：</p>
<p>國民生活，應該漸漸的趨於合理化，一致從節約消費中度着平均水準的刻苦生活，換言之，逸是大家苦中得飽，各就本位爲戰時政策而努力。談不到物質享受，因爲享受之極，就是消耗，戰時生活的意義，根本不准消耗，沒有享受可言。</p>
<p>戰時經濟，應該漸漸的趨於生產化，無論工業農業方面，凡為戰爭需要，凡與生活有關的，都應講求增加生產之道，生產數量，務須比較戰前增加，供應戰爭需要。</p>
<p>戰時政治，應該漸漸的趨於效率化，一切行政設施，絕對不尚官樣文章的表面粉飾，而注意於實質的成效。同時，政治體制，漸漸適合於戰時的簡單化，消滅重床疊架，駢枝繁複的現象。而為取得人民自動協力參戰的實效，對於伸張民意的機構，應在政府督導之下促其組織實現。</p>
<p>戰時文化，應漸漸的趨於普遍化，為使人民大衆瞭解戰爭的意義與勝利的重要，以及如何貢獻力量？如何協力友邦？文化宣傳工作無疑是深入民間的利器，務須使之普遍流傳，廣植種子。</p>
<p>以上四點，不過舉其最主要的而言，如果這四點能夠逐漸做到理想的地步，我們相信對於爭取勝利，比較有了把握。也就是實現宣戰佈吿中的「與友邦日本協力，一掃英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放」，比較有了把握。然而，積極一點的說法，我們旣然參戰了，那末，勝利乃是國家生存的保證，非絕對爭取不可。凡是有利於勝利把握的事，非絕對做到不可，在這樣的論斷之下，上面所舉四點，乃爲必須成爲事實的事，而絕非理想的事了</p>
<p>可是，今天巳經是參戰以後八個月了，八個月的時間，並不能說短促。我們平心靜氣，澈底的切實的檢討一下，反省一下，今天各方面的事實，與我們的「理想」，究竟還有若干距離呢？我們實在不願吹毛求疵，或是故意挑剔；可是，我們也不欲抹煞事實，濫唱高調。因此，我們願以持平態度，作客觀分析如次：</p>
<p>國民生活，仍未能逐漸的合理化，依然苦與樂尖銳對立。因爲糧價與物價的繼漲增高，貧苦大衆的生活益形不支。終日愁眉苦臉，週旋於油鹽柴米之間。而另方面，「有錢」階級的生活，趨向奢華豪闊，也是日進不巳。一席宴筵的代價，有耗一二萬金亳無吝色的，誠是駭人聽聞。而飯店戲院娛樂銷金之窟，華燈初上，人聲鼎沸，莫不座滿，利市百倍，窮苦者顚倒於籌劃如何得到一飽？豪富者沉湎於打算如何盡情享受？苦樂雖異，而漠然於戰爭勝利者無殊。生活狀態愈是不均，戰爭勝利觀念愈是淡薄。</p>
<p>戰時經濟，不但不能增加生產，甚且生產萎縮。就上海一地的工業生產以言，更見顯著萎縮。而擁有資金者更追求於投機暴利，造成物價狂漲的畸形經濟局面。自從政府頒令收買紗布後，經濟界的嚴重波動，也足以證明以往一切投機囤積的囂張。追求私利愈烈者，就是社會公利觀念愈薄者，欲期其貢獻一切於戰爭，誠戞戞乎難了。</p>
<p>戰時政治，迄未見有效率之表現，政治體制雖有調整，惟實質效率，終未獲得，其主因常在與人民利益尙有隔閡，故人民一日無參政機會，即民意一日不能有效表達，政府措施與人民公意之間，尙有鴻溝存在。</p>
<p>戰時文化，更未能普遍推進，而依然消沉莫振。精神食糧與物質食糧原佔同樣重要地位，我們回顧日本文化界的出版事業，與戰前同樣的普遍發達，紙張尙售每令五元。政府對於出版界並充分配給。如與上海比較，紙黑市每令較戰前漲達五百餘倍者，誠是霄壤之間，令人瞠目失其知覺。因此，上海一地向爲全國出版之中心者，每月出版書籍，竟不滿五種，可憐情形，言之氣沮。在這塲合，作家生活異常淸苦，無精心創作，巳屬理所必至。而期於宜揚戰爭意義，提高人民警覺，實覺南轅而北轍。</p>
<p>我們認爲中國所能協力於參戰者，惟有物資爲最大可能之一種，但物資之取得，先在安定人民生活，然後努力於增加生產工作，以增益物資。如果人民生活不能安定，生產趨於萎縮，物資必然缺乏，如何可言協力參戰？這情形如無法亟圖改善，不但不能協力參戰，且將增累友邦戰時責任。至於如何改善現狀？唯一的步驟，是從修明政治入手，政治上軌道，一切國民生活以及經濟文化，都能趨於正常發展，人民生活從此安定，增加生產從此實現，戰爭勝利從此完遂。我們趁此參戰紀念之日，用申所見，敢請朝野三反省之。</p>

<p>柏林八日中央社電　德軍常局七日宣稱，庫爾斯克西方要衝科諾托普（Konotop）市刻仍在德軍手中。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　據海通社軍事訪員稱：東綫南路之防禦戰益趨猛烈，蘇軍業己調到生力軍參戰，至德軍則仍持彈性防禦戰術，將更多之土地放棄唐納資盆地，德軍之移動在繼續進行中，德軍之後衛抑陰蘇軍之追踪並予敵方以相當之損失。自伊齊姆向聶伯河進攻之蘇軍己遭抑止，卡科夫西南之蘇　繼續向克拉期諾格勒推進，遭遇德軍堅強抵抗，蘇軍進攻波爾太伐迤東亦未得逞。格羅考夫以西與科諾托普附近之蘇軍壓力甚強，敵軍前鋒業巳抵達科諾托普之東北郊，現戰事仍在進行中。敵軍在白里安斯克迤南恢復進攻，惟蘇軍企圖自北包圍該城之側面行動則已停頓。基洛夫台爾邢與斯麼倫斯克以東部之勢未變，蘇軍局部之進攻己被擊退，</p>
<p>德機千架東綫施威</p>
<p>柏林八日中央　電　德國新聞社空軍訪員稱：德轟炸機斯多加機與主力機數千架，於星期日襲擊展開在唐納資盆地·伊齋姆·卡科失等品以及東綫中部各焦點之蘇軍坦克軍部隊·敵方供應綫遭德機之襲擊，炸毀重要橋　三座，德機夜襲蘇方重要鐵路交叉點啦處，炸毀子彈車一列，鐵軌受損甚大。德軍防禦武器聲破蘇軍坦克車一百四十四輛，同時又有十七輛爲德空軍所炸毀，德戰鬥機與商射砲隊擊落六寸架，德機損失僅八架。</p>
<p>蘇軍攻勢重大代價</p>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　據倫敦消息：英國勞工大臣貝文在林肯郡南港工會大會中宣稱：蘇聯在夏季攻勢中，曾付驚人之代價，英國與蘇聯之關係，係以英蘇友好公約及合作爲根據。</p>
<p>阿根廷下令準備防空</p>
<p>阿根廷京城八日中央社電　阿根廷政府今日下令，全國準備於任何時對空襲能動員所有防禦制度，全國防禦系統已由陸軍　管理。萬一實際空襲發生時，陸軍部長於海軍部長之合作下，得委派防空司令一人，以便實施陸海軍兩部有關空防決定。該命令並授權政府得於任何時動員所有尙未被召入伍之男子，外國男子亦可微用，惟僅作消極之國防工作，防空常局有權徵用空防所需之器具，違者得　以鉅款。</p>
<h3>羅斯福邱吉爾　將繼續會談　英美蘇會議在準備中</h3>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　據華盛頓消息：英首相邱吉爾在波斯頓受領哈佛大學之名饗博士學位後，巳返至華盛頓，昨日又與羅斯福總統會談一小時以上。總統秘書歐萊稱：羅斯福·邱吉爾將繼總會談，必要時英·美之軍事參謀·亦將前往白宮。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城八日中央社電　據華盛頓來電，羅斯福七日對記者團稱：牟貝克會議後，關於邀請斯達林委員長舉行三國會議事，巳有相當準備，惟至何種程度以及其他詳細情形雖不能加以說明，但此交涉於今後一兩日內將更有進展。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城八日中央社電　消息靈通之華盛頓方面人士今日宣稱：邱吉爾首相並無於數日内離華盛頓返歐之意。據稱邱吉爾緩期離美他往，或即短期內將有重　事件發生之表示</p>
<h3>蒙特巴頓　準備就職忙</h3>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　據倫敦消息，新任亞洲東南反軸心軍司令蒙特巴頓動爵，現在倫敦極為活動，以其大部份時間管備就任新職，傳渠昨日曾與前蘇　駐英大使邁斯基及印度大臣阿姆里其進午膳，其後又會見渝方駐　大使顧維鈞及新任印度總督華維爾元帥。　倫敦深軍界見解，蒙特巴頓現時爲署海軍中將階級，但因其新任命頗爲重要，故雖年僅四十三，亦或將晉陞爲署滬軍上將。</p>
<p>德專家討論印度洋局勢</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　哈斐特博士於其論文中推測印度洋是否將成爲戰爭焦點之問題稱：蒙特巴頓將軍被委爲東雨亞洲英美軍總司令之舉，乃係奎貝克會議之結果。此種行動乃反軸心國家承認對日作戰之失敗而巳。羅斯福總統因　國内政治局勢之壓迫，故決定對日採取斷然行動。在一九四〇年羅斯福總統欺騙美國民衆謂，以美國之物資援助英國，乃所以保存美國之自身者，因低估日軍之實力，故於珍珠港中突受攻擊，美國實以力量集中於歐洲而不注意太平洋之防禦也。在奎貝克會議中羅斯福總統壓迫邱吉爾首相，便其負擔太平洋之戰事，比較英國前此所貢獻者為大，此足證明美國不能獨力決定東亞之戰爭，但斯蒂威爾將軍及麥克沃塞將軍是否在其指揮之下以及蒙特巴頓將軍之作戰責任如何，現尙未十分淸楚。因地中海戰事之發展結果，使英海軍得以增加其在東南亞洲之行動自由。英海軍向被縳東於地中海區，現於突尼西亞及西西軍之征服後，則局勢之危險减少，故英國得以重新調　其軍力，而以援軍開赴印度洋，因此理由世界戰事之焦點現將移至印度之大門，乃並非出乎意外。歐洲對於東南亞洲之將來演襲或不盛覺興趣，但在該地所發生之事實，其影　於歐洲者，亦即如歐洲之事實能影響大東亞戰　。</p>
<h3>埃蘇樹立　外交關係</h3>

<h3>英美機襲德　喪失重大　一日中達七十架</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　美空軍於六日上午轟炸斯茲托葛特。英空軍繼於六日夜轟炸慕尼黑。據德軍當局宣稱：德軍於斯茲托葛特上空，聲落美軍轟炸機五十一架，於慕尼黑擊落英軍　炸機十五架，此外尙有聶炸機六架於瑞士領內墜落，或因機件發生障碍被迫降陸，故反軸軍心任於是日之轟炸中，喪失重轟炸機約七十二架，駕駛員七百名。大體反軸軍空每次轟炸使用重轟炸機二百架乃至三百架，故假令晝夜合計使用五百架，則其　害己在一成五分以上。又據德軍當局宣稱：美空軍轟炸德本土時所受之捐害，漸次增加，七月廿六日轟炸漢諾威及漢堡喪失重轟炸機三十架，七月二十八日轟炸卡　爾喪失三十五架，八月一日轟炸羅馬尼亞油田喪失五十二架，尙有十五架於中立國境內墜落，八月十二日轟炸波昻喪失三十七架。</p>
<h3>歐戰四周年　德國內外情勢的檢討</h3>
<p>自從在波蘭的一角（但澤市）燃起了歐洲的戰火之後，至本　一日巳屆四週年了。在這期問，支配歐洲戰局的特徵，爲軸心方面自開戰以來最初且感到最緊迫的事實，即蘇聯在東戰綫初次發動夏季大攻勢，戰局無疑的遭遇了重大局面。地中海方而且也受着威脅，西歐方面，因蘇聯的熱烈要求，展開第二戰綫的機運，頓見濃原。這種　繞着歐洲要塞四周迫切情形，較去年此時，確可以說是德國的「不振」。但從本質來加以檢討，而正　地把握將來的動向時，由於紅軍的初次夏季攻勢，德軍曾不無後退，但在觀念上所與的印象　頗嫌誇大，蓋詳細檢討事實時，並未產生了「得驚異的變化。</p>
<p>大攻勢的跳臺</p>
<p>現在的德蘇對時狀態與本年初此較時，僅中部的奧萊爾，卡科夫及其附近，　積上約及全局克蘭的三十分之一，被蘇聯軍收復。而且這中部的撤退，也係由於所謂出血戰術的新作戰上的必要，比去年大規模「略地攻勢」，當然見遜。那麽德軍今後怎樣應付東部戰綫呢？德國究竟在葫蔗裏　什麽藥，一般人頗致猜疑。克拉烏賽此茲報稱：「守軍得視狀况而改取攻勢，但攻軍不能由那樣簡單的移轉形式而改取守勢。」德軍的「出血戰術」，正爲預想到將發生數處的正而作戰，爲確立以防衛歐洲大陸爲目的之長期不敗態勢起　，並爲迫使蘇聯不能取冬　攻勢起見，德軍的反攻，當然預定繼目前的撤退戰之後即將實施。</p>
<p>上述的作戰方法，現在極有效果地進展着，蘇軍在奧萊爾，卡科夫西方不過突入五十公里，然而所付的代價計損失戰車旅團一百六十個，兵員一百六十萬。因此，現在的後退，在德軍正視爲是　的「跳躍合」，所以德軍雖說「頹勢」，但尙從本國領士深入敵國一千餘公里，維持二千公里以上的對時綫。因此，一局部地方戰鬥經過，殊難以判斷全局的得失。</p>
<p>歐洲防禦固若金湯</p>
<p>其次，說到英美方面所呼號的歐洲登陸戰。攻佔西西里島後的反軸心眾，今已虎視耽耽，窺伺義國本土。如蘇聯所指出，英美如企圖侵入歐洲大陸，　將與德軍一決雌雄，但按月之各種狀況與情報，英美似乎完全沒有孤注一擲的決心。英美曾誇謂北非之戰告終後可以節省迂迥開普敦航路的船隻幾百萬噸，但卽在西西里島之役，已費了半年的準備。向義國本土的登陸，卽使萬一獲得一時的成功，軸心陣綫亦終究不致於動搖。</p>
<p>倚恃多數的英美，占領一西西里島，已經費了五星期，這期問英美所受的捐失，不可勝計。總之，德軍無論對於東戰錢，南戰錢及今後或將展開的其他戰綫，爲蓄藏戰力起見，當取被動的作戰，卽防禦戰術，這在現在也巳經可以窺知了。</p>
<p>爲了書藏戰力卽空軍也寗願甘受英美的恐怖空襲，和國民一共咬緊牙關忍受。這抑屈的情緖，一旦由於所積貯的戰力而勃發時，歐洲戰局卽將有明朗的開展。上述那種對於戰局的見解，成爲遭受一切困苦的德國民氣的根柢。</p>
<p>國內態勢亦吿完整</p>
<p>過去四年問，德國國民生活在各方面其困苦的程度與年俱增。尤以本年以來，實施一般市民動員計劃的結果，如柏林地方，與戰爭無實際問係的商店，被封閉者約百分之六十。鑑於漢堡空襲的情形，預定　從柏林疏散市民百萬，其決戰的色彩，似愈趨徹底。</p>

<h3>義南部山區　後衛戰劇烈　英軍在烏斐米亞登陸</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德元首行營八日正午發表：反軸心軍已於七日夜在義南部加拉布里亞洲之烏斐米亞潛登陸。軸心軍於八日拂曉以來，即對該登陸部隊猛烈攻擊中。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　蒙高茂萊所部英第八軍自佔加拉布里亞洲之古都柏爾米後，無若何進展，全圖進攻該市北方之部隊，遭德軍邀　，負重創退走。於中部戰綫，企圖進至加拉那方面之部隊爲險峻之山岳地帶所阻，似巳不能前進。南部戰綫英軍之進攻亦極緩慢，德軍當局認此次反軸心軍對　拉布里亞洲之作戰，不過係欲在其他方面登陸所　開之牽制作戰。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德國新開社地中海區特派　柏勒納稱：由勒佐通往東北之沿海公路上傑地亞托　（Gidsatauro）附近，英軍與德後防隊作戰數小時，損失甚重，英軍因企圖突破德軍之防護砲火綫未果，而遭重大之損失，故繼續遲遲而進，竭力避免與德·義後防隊發生接觸。敵軍在史北繼續登陸，其意似在企圖進入德軍後防隊之後方。</p>
<p>羅馬八日中央社電　義從軍　者七日就英第八軍於加拉布里亞登陸，及其後作戰之進展情形報道如次：反軸心軍擁有優勢軍器，以所有艦砲及陸上全部砲火，對維拉聖侖梵尼，勒佐，蕯南伏等加拉布里　半　南岸一帶之義軍砲合綫猛攻，此外並以擁有戰艦數艘之大艦隊，一齊開砲猛轟，同時對岸黑四拿海岸之陸上砲火亦頗熾烈，又復以蔽空之轟炸機大編自上空投彈轟炸，但軸心軍雖於此情勢下仍奮異批抗，予一部登陸敵軍以莫大損害。交戰區之住民己預先移向後方安全地帶，守備隊刻匕將沿海岸綫登陸之敵軍部隊擊退，惟因反軸心砲擊過烈，亦不得不暫爲後退。此際反軸心軍乃以登陸用汽艇陸續戰坦克車及中小口徑砲登陸，軸心軍對之即澈底加以猛擊予以重創。惟敵搬運登陸之大砲坦克車爲數甚多。故軸心軍雖奮勇突擊，而敵終於在聖喬梵尼至薩爾伏一帶携大量之重砲坦克車登陸，此外反軸心軍並以降落傘部隊協力登陸部隊，惟己經軸心軍予以相當損害。現戰爭正於該海岸綫若干公里之內地展開，但該方而爲著名之山岳地帶，加以據險抵抗之軸心軍勢甚猛然，致使反軸心軍之進展遲緩。</p>

<h3>向銀行貸款購糧　已簽訂協定　米糧統委會月內可成立</h3>
<p>上海社記者探悉，本市關係當局，爲澈底安定民食保障民生計，已決定向銀行貸借鉅款購儲食糧，俾能源源供給人民正常需要之計動，事由某區主管　關與某大銀行洽妥，已簽協定。本市當道務盡全力改良糧政之決心，殆由此事見之。又訉，關於米糧探辦配給事宜，茲經物資統制審議會議決，將由糧食部移交全國商業統制總會辦理，由商統會另組米糧統制委員會主其事，該委員會刻在籌備組織之中，該委會一日成立，其辦事處設於市商會內。</p>
<p>後立成會統糧聯營社結束</p>
<p>蘇浙皖三省京滬兩特別市之民食問題。深爲各界人士所重視，尤其上海一隔，數百萬民衆佔在非生產區內，殷望內地產區之米糧源源運濾調節民食，更爲切要。自糧食部計劃統制米糧採運配給辦法實施以來，惟因種種關係、及主管米糧採述機構組織之欠完善，以致影響配給戶口米，不能如期足量。當局有鑒於斯，經有關各方研究結果，決予重行調整米糧統制機構，以資改進民食需要，聞此案經全國商業統制總會擬訂米糧統制方案，提經物資統制審議委員會第六次會議議決通過。對於調整今後收買米糧機構，決由全國商業統制總會另設米糧統制委員會，經行政院指定上海市商會理事長袁履登為鑄備主任委員，林康侯·陳光中·載藹蘆·紀華·陣子彝·楊河淸·何權生·嚴際·羅納齋·爲籌備委員，日內由袁氏召集各委員舉行首次籌備會討論籌備　行步驟，擬訂組織規程，及米糧採運分配等間題，至遲本月底前卽可籌組成立。至於上海區以及各地區之米糧聯營社，將在米糃統制委員會宣告成立時結束，所有一切經辦事業，全部移交該會接收辦哩。</p>
<p>口米配給量須納入正軌</p>
<p>本　口米　第一區公，經濟處向中文米　配給組合　借，係屬一時權宜之講，故數量亦較正常配給時期為減少，（在七月份前每期二升）故是種現狀，不能聽其廷　，亟須經入正軌。米糧營運新機構對國米之採購與趕運，殊有急起直追，迅赴事功必要，據大通社中者探悉，米糧統制委員會發表委員名單中之楊和淸，據昨日息，楊氏對委員一職，表示婉　，但市民對　食機構，倍致關注，不　稍有徘徊瞻顧也。</p>
<p>又訉本市第四區第一二兩坊第廿一期戶口米，業於日前停止發售，第二十二期戶口米，計共二一五〇包（糙米），亦經該區聯營公　辦事處辦理出貨竣事，本可即行分發公　，奈以此次購米證剛於昨（八日）起由　辦處交由該區第一，二兩坊公所轉發各聯保以及各戶，故手續上或將延遲數天，大致約於本星期五（十日）或可普迥發售。</p>

<h3>上海第一個　女人主辦的醫院　西門外婦孺醫院訪問記</h3>
<p>內外產婦小兒諸科診治認眞　現代各種機械醫療設備完善</p>
<p>紅色的公共汽車送你到福屬理路循台拉斯　路向南步行，大約二百公尺，前面就是永遠那麼幽靜的徐家匯路。華嘉浜北那一大片翠綠　滴的園林，時有一陣淸新鮮美的微風，拂去人們的塵思，向右看，　時着幢幢白色的洋樓，像給誰特意嵌在奇天白雲巾一樣，多麼美麗啊；鐵門上的匾牌告訴你，這就是上海第一所由女子主持的而且特別注力於救護貧病者的一上海四門外婦孺醫院」</p>
<p>紅訪子到白宮</p>
<p>西門外婦孺醫院，俗稱「紅房子醫院」，成立怏六十年，是在一八八四年，由美國人羅醫師首創，設在老四門方斜路紅房子，爲上海極負聲譽的醫院，後來由基督敎監理會，沒理會和女公會的熱心信徒合力主辦，民國廿六年，受到上海戰事的影響，不得不抓淚別　故居，忽忽　移到徐家匯路八五〇號這所「白宮」，即以前牛惠生骨科醫院，重新經營起來嗎因爲該處比較僻靜，爲了繼續救濟貧病起見，又租借福煦路三三四號（成　路口）舊牛惠　醫院為「四門外婦孺醫院門診分所一，新舊患　，大部分極向分所　診。</p>
<p>年來一般市民，受時局與物價的影響，生活困難，貧病交迫者，所在皆有，但是相反的現象，是有許多一向從事於貧病救濟工作的醫院或醫師，則因種種關係，臨時停頓，因此無力求醫，婉　待斃的，更是充斥市井，四門　，自然不能無　隱之心，因此從去年五月起，不　困難與　利，毅然　　從前外籍醫師所設的哥倫比亞路平民門訟，每星期三次，施診給藥，專治　近草棚內苦力及其家　的疾病。至今年五月起又出而扣任貧兒敎養院的義務診院，每星期一次。雖然她們的力量有限，未能普救社會上所有的貧病者，但是她們已盡了極大的力量，所謂：「有一分力，發一分光，」務求减少一般貧苦同胞的病痛。</p>
<p>醫生，本來以　務社曾　除病人痛苦為最高目　，醫院和慈善團體，理論上應該不會有太漢的距雖。但是在不健全的現社會，我們還不能責望每一個醫師乃醫院都能深明大義，犧牲服務，往往有此病狀過重無法救治的，便遭拒絕。病家所受痛苦如何，不雖想像。西門婦孺醫院，對此特別警戒，祇要一息尙存，除傳染病轉送傳染病院以外，其餘概不拒絕，盡力救治，往往奪回生命，便有說不出的高興。據　院長說，每年約有住院病人一千六百人，門診病人一萬六千數百人，該院病患者的死亡率極低，最近二年紀錄中，連來院未及醫治而即氣絕者在內，計三十一年之死亡率爲二九％三十二年則爲二，一％。</p>
<p>女子病房一瞥</p>
<p>走進西門婦孺醫院大門，迎面一片圍地，業業鳳仙花，在　曦中搖曳，生氣勃勃。雖然時間還早，門診部的職員已在準備著日常診療工作了。候診室不很大，但是很淸爽，好像是什麼花園的休息室。據設，對於一般貧苦的求診者，不僅不收診費，還常常送給藥品，重病還得住院。</p>
<p>門診部裏面是藥劑室，這不同於一般醫院裏簡陋的配藥處，她們有比較完善的設備，並有專任藥劑師負責，除了日常庶用的　藥之外，還經常從事於製藥及製藥研究工作。對於每一病人所需的藥品之調配，都有一定的手繼，仔細配製，審愼覆核，這裏的從業員都明瞭她們一舉手之間，對於病人生命的關係。</p>
<p>病房和普通醫院一樣分等級，但她們　依病患的程度而分，不一定只從收費多寡上打算。三等病房有的一個房裏容納十多只病床、但是不怎樣顯得擁擠。多　三等病房也是一房只放二架病床，因爲勤於淸潔工作感不到醫院所特有的氣味，卻有醫院遇到的看護。病人住三等的，可以繳較小的費用，在享受上却不見得比頭二等差些，有一部分實在無力繳費的，還可以免繳。</p>
<p>頭二等病房多數在樓上·這裏的特點是在內部，　施上除科學化之外，更注意於藝術化，柔和的光綫，悅目的壁飾，再加上那麽一枝兩枝不太濃　的鮮花，並允許家裏派人來倍伴（當然得守醫院的規則），這樣，從病人的心裏上，减輕所受的痛苦。輕者斜倚著看書，一會兒閉目仰首，是休息，還是沉思？　畔那笑容無意中告訴參觀者對於醫院的滿意。</p>
<p>雖然如此，婦孺醫院的服務的重心，還是放在三等病房裏的，全院病床一百四十七只，頭等的不過十一只，二等的也不過四十五只，三等的倒有九十一只。對於有力繳付較爲昻貴的醫藥費的，固然盡力診治，但對於貧苦病人，也決不疏忽。</p>
<p>診療室的訪問</p>
<p>診療室，似乎是容易引起人們的痛苦之感的地方吧，但是醫師和護士的誠　服務精神與溫柔的態度，可以彌補這種缺感。</p>
<p>兒童病房里，溢田小孩的啼聲，小兒科的主治醫師黃淑　女士正在診治一個己屆危險期的痢疾的患者，一會兒她鬆了口氣說：好了，這條小生命可以保全了！她不及和別人談話，又去診治另一個小病人。頭等兒童病房裏的病孩，有家裏的人侍候着，情緖比較安靜些，院長得意地獎　這位小見科主治醫師，她在一九三五年學業於上海女子醫學院後，曾赴北平協和醫院實習，然後到該院任兒科醫師、因爲熱心與負責，而日治綾」優異，在去年升任兒科主治醫師。</p>
<p>婦科醫療室的部署與設備之完善，在上海還是不可多得的。主治醫師王淑貞女士，一九二五年學業於約翰霍金大學醫科，自一九二六年以後即在該院服務，在一九三一至三九年間，並曾担任女子醫學院的婦科專任敎師。她細心地解釋婦科醫療上的設備及其功能，她表不，為了認眞為病人服務，實可自已的生活節約到最低，對於醫療必要的工具，却不能不力求完備。</p>
<p>產房、幾乎沒有一天是閒置的，兩架最新型的產床，旁邊倍伴著嬰兒床和別的手術工具，附近就有洗漱室和消毒間，滅菌機還在冒著熱汽。產婦和新生的赤子，部有特別的房間，產婦房裏充滿着安溢與愉悅的氣氛，不大光亮，但是空氣清新，當護士抱着　出世的孩子來嗎奶的時候，產婦顯得蒼白的臉上表現出痛苦後感激與愉快的微笑。</p>
<p>一拼小鐵床裏，掀動着紅色的嬰孩的嘴臉，多可愛！護士們在忙着照顧。</p>

<h3>六期戶口糖　糖質頗潮濕　據稱存放日期過久所致</h3>
<p>本市第六明計口授糟、前因關整售價關係，致未能發售，茲悉糖商合作營　處所擬定之我整售價，未獲當局核准，而市民食糖需洪甚殷，是以決仍照原價發售。第一八兩區已於昨日起普遍實施，每人仍規定半斤，價爲二元三角五分，其他各區則定於本月中旬開始發售，南市第五期食糖，將於今日截止。査該期所發售之食糖，大都潮濕，據糖　自稱，以各零售糖商，自出糖至發售日期，相距達四十日之久，適値大伏，是以食糖感熱溶化所致，且一部份尚係六個月以前之存糖。致外問嘖有煩言。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>「貢獻」的解釋</h3>
<p>收買紗布以來之經辨界不安心理無、非由於事理認　之不足，我們已繼說過了。我們　得友邦日本駐　各大使日昨所發表的重要談話，其中有幾旬話是值得大家認　的：「收買棉紗布之使命及其重要性·胥視今後如何加以處理爲定·蓋此項重大施策，對低物價及安定民生。將有何種程度之貢獻，則觀今後中日如何協力，即可明瞭。」</p>
<p>我們若把這幾句扼要的話，加以剖　，自不難對於事理多加一層的認識。收買棉紗布，以至於收買棉紗布以外之主要必需物資，其使命與重要性，即在於對低物價與安定民生一個共同目標上，如何努力邁進。以期有所貢獻，「貢獻」兩個字的解釋是什麼？廣泛地說，「貢獻」是成就的意思；嚴格地說，貢獻就是供給，就是補助；政府所收買者。如何把它供給民衆所需要，補助民衆所缺乏·那就是政府對於人民的眞實貢獻。至於能夠貢獻到什麽程度，正如谷大使所說的，還得要看中日如何協力。</p>
<h3>本市工商界計劃　恢復南洋貿易　希望協助克服航運困難</h3>
<p>自太平洋戰爭爆發以還，上海與南洋各地交通中斷，各項留易即告停頓，查事變之前，上海與南洋間每年之貿易額，極爲可觀，各種物資，由南洋方面運滬，而其製成品，則暢銷于南洋各地，是故</p>
<p>貿易停頓</p>
<p>對於本市工商界之發展影響至鉅。昨據本市工商界某鉅子稱：本市工商金融各界，爲使滬市整個經濟發展趨向正常起見，早有恢復南洋留易之意，過云曾與關係當局數度集議，但尚無具體計劃。最近工商界認為此事。</p>
<p>急不待緩</p>
<p>故連日加緊進行，目前所圾引爲難事者，即航運殊欠通暢，決以最大努力，要求當局協助，良以南洋貿易一日不通，滬工商界一日不得</p>
<p>充分發展</p>

<p>大衆生活</p>
<h3>銀行練習生</h3>
<p>— 小怡</p>
<p>一般的觀念，以爲銀行員的飯碗是金的，旣穩固，又優渥。所以在民二十九年冬，得著機會由親戚介紹，參與索負名望的商業銀行的練習生考試，常錄取通知書寄到我家全家的人歡愉萬分，親友也成來致慶，以爲從此職業安定，可以再也無憂無愁於生活了。</p>
<p>懷看顆欣喜的心，在三十年的新正，跑進銀行的大廈，正式虛心努力底做起練習生來了。部時雖然感到生疏不懂，但對每件事都　十二分的興趣，抱着只要我不做錯事，克勤克儉的工作，將來升行員，升主任，做經理，前途希望無剪的信心。　中憧憬着美麗的夢境，埋頭學習着應做的事。</p>
<p>練習生的名字，顧名思義是銀行本身爲培植有用人才而設。其工作應使練習明寮銀行業務爲主；其薪給當然遠差於行員。誰知我自前年進行，被派定工作後，至今二年半，一直沒有再調到其他部份練習過。本部份的事最初是覺到不懂，困難，等到沒幾天弄熟了，就每天機械的一直做到現在。自已經手的事，是做得厭煩枯　到極點。關於共他部份的事，還是莫名所以。當初期望自己只要努力學習的造就，仝變爲雲消烟散物價步步高漲，生活日艱，許多親友都愁眉苦臉的度著日子，知道我服務於大銀行，難面時終是說：「你寫意囉！你的日子比我們好過呀」，誰相信我每月拿的不及拉洋車的收入呢！一個銀行行員、在國家銀行這和幾個極少數的商業銀行，他們易可以有二千左右的收入。在我們行裏，一個行員連薪津在一起，不滿千元。我們練習生每月只有四百大元津貼，正薪從前年到行，試用三月期滿後，就是十六元，直到現在，沒有增加過。誰會相信，坐在富麗堂皇的銀行大廈裏的整天有千百萬頭寸過手的人，家裏會運粥都喝不飽，因爲買不起油而吃白煮菜，洗衣因肥皂貴而不用呢！</p>
<p>拉車的可以穿破的，吃粗的，一個練習生郤不能穿着短衫褲，赤着脚，去辦公。平日與行員在一起共事，人家有婚喪喜慶，又不能不應酬。茶役司關跟在後面叫先生。過年過節更不能因爲我是練習生而不開消。「銀行業的飯碗是金的」這句話，大概在另一個時代是確切的，現在銀行業的飯碗，是西北風的，越喝越冷，越吃越餓。</p>
<p>工廠裏用童工，女工，並不是在男工之外，夏廣泛的造就技術人才，而是老關們可以省一些工資。銀行裏用練習生，美其名說是培植銀行人才。實則也是爲了省掉一藍薪津，我們平日的工作，和行員根本不分，所負責任也當然和行員一樣，全行有三分之一的練習生做着辦事員的工作，這是很明顯的。</p>
<p>我所服務的銀行，不是一個小銀行，當然像我一們一樣和更不如我們的、還很多。並不是單為練習生的待遇而呼籲，長此下去，整個銀行業的　　是黯淡的。</p>

<h3>歐戰四周年　德國內外情勢檢討</h3>
<p>（自第二版轉來）最低限度的衣　住</p>
<p>跟着此次而實施的　食　證，自八月廿三日起。已經使用第五十三期券。至此，其分配量有如次的變化。主要食品中的肉類，第一次所分配的每人每週五百公分，本年三月以來。减至二百五十公分，僅爲開戰時的一半麺包據開戰時戈林的聲明，擬不加限制，但至一九三九年十月，規定每週爲二千五百公分，四一年起每週二千公分，本年三月以後，爲補充肉的减量跑乃增加二百五十公分。半油至四一年比開　時增加一百二十五公分共計五百公分，至今不變。</p>
<p>人造牛油減至當初的一半豬油亦因現在不能獲得，故油脂類大體上亦不免略有减少。但牛酪則自三月以來增加一百廿五公分，約爲三九年的二倍，國民的脂肪　養索得告保持，德國人當作米的馬鈴警。至戰爭第三年　預約購買制，四二年度起，亦採憑證制，每週約配給三千五百公分　實大然分出於製造甜　，而大爲减少。自本年一月起至八月止，成人配給十磅、兒童二十磅。砂糖在三九年度每三週　配給一千公分，現在爲九百公分。</p>
<p>其次是被服，開戰最初二　月，關於主要衣類，必須購買許可證，而成爲分數制。最近因空轉的激化，停止成年者使用衣類券，僅對空襲中罹災者發行購買許可證。衣類製造業者亦命令專　這些罹難者的需要。</p>
<p>第三，居佳的變化，因本年度進入決戰時期，由於大都布的被炸而　著地表現出來。自本年春的住宅統制以來，從六月初起、復　施「關於供給罹難者住宅的新規定」等緊急對策，新屬及親友的同宿，都會人之向鄕間借屋；屋頂，地下　之住宅的　造，均趨增加，搜査空襲避難所成爲新的課　，據樂方面，也因戰爭的長期化激烈化，以斯淋林格勒之戰爲　　，而斷然加以　淸。交造機關中的出租汽車，除病人以外，在警察之嚴密統制下，限制乘客。一切不必要的東四，均爲完遂戰爭而犧牲了。在內政方面，因希姆拉新內政部長的登塲而掌握治安全權後，使國民生活在最後愈趨緊迫</p>
<p>經濟生活的推移</p>
<p>英美的　德轟炸　不能把生隆力予以決定的破壞、但隨着對蘇戰的長期化，更威脅深刻化的戰時繼濟，出現空襲經濟的新名詞、而表現目前的經濟生活。軍需生產暫置不論，一般消費財之因空襲而缺乏的狀態，不能否定。對此，在强靱的組織力之下，實施各種劉　，而　滿地維持秩序。一面因開戰以來的莫大的民需吸收，他面因國民所得的增加，尤因斯　林格勒之戰後動員潛存人口的結果，均使國民的所得大爲增加。延長勞動時間亦爲其原因之一，通貨膨脹的危險，祇有最近短期債的增加。原來的物價工資限制，亳未動搖。徐國國民生活之三大耍索的房租·石炭·飮食物的價格，得保最低限度的安定。</p>
<p>空襲下變態的一種現象，換物思　似告减退。物的價値因轟炸而被認為無價値，而多數人均增加手頭現金以備　時　地避難的急需。基本的戰時經濟性質，自一九三九年以來，一味向同一方向　　，其發展的結果，一切經濟活動均爲了遂行戰爭而强化統一的統制。生產力之暫的，量的，勞動力及原料之圓滑的配給這三大項目中，生產力的增减如何，成爲當前的問題。</p>
<p>白熱化的德國精神</p>
<p>經過西部聯綫的大勝。直至席捲巴爾幹的時期，即以蘭逐英國在　　的勢力的期間，以閃電戰的偉　及歐洲新秩　的新興情緒爲背景，形成德國民衆之初期的「勝利者」之戰爭　。然而　蘇開戰後，這戰爭觀便有很大的變化。園斯　林格勒之戰而愈深刻化，前次漢堡被炸，根本修正了　國民衆的戰爭觀。現在的戰爭觀是　減戰爭的觀念。現在英美所施的空　，「恐怖」這名詞尙不能缺切表現，乃是使地上一切盡化爲烏有的殘滅空炸。</p>
<p>因此，全德人民的戰爭觀，亦爲人類戰爭史上最初的東西。「戰擊是政治的廷長」這定義。早被抛棄，每個人民現在不能不覺悟日夜　時可生可死。所以現在每個人民所抱的憎惡芙美的情緖與前錢用槍刺殺敵人的兵士亳無異致。對於個人生活的　持，現已完全放棄，第一次世界大戰時連犬　也當作食糧而搞戰至最後的情形固不必說，　薪嘗胆的精神，今日完全再現於德國。（翔：　自九月一日束京　　報知）</p>

<h3>從曦藥限價到配給</h3>

<h3>Reflections on Eight Months of War Participation</h3>
<p>On January 9th of this year, the National Government issued a proclamation declaring war on Great Britain and the United States. Since then, the ninth day of each month has been designated as a War Participation Memorial Day. To elevate the spirit of resistance against the enemy and to awaken public awareness, the proclamation of war participation is repeatedly published in various newspapers on each memorial day. Today is the ninth time we have seen this proclamation, meaning that it has been a full eight months since the declaration of war. The war declaration solemnly stated: "From this day forward, we are at war with Great Britain and the United States. We shall exert all our strength, cooperate with our friendly nation of Japan, sweep away the brutality of Great Britain and the United States, and strive for China's revival and the liberation of East Asia." If everyone can truly read this proclamation each time, then these words will surely be engraved in their hearts and will not be ignored!</p>
<p>In our ideal scenario, after participating in the war, especially after eight months, the general situation in the country should be able to achieve the following points:</p>
<p>The people's livelihood should gradually become rationalized, and everyone should live a frugal life at an average standard through saving and consumption. In other words, everyone should endure hardship to get enough to eat and do their best in their respective positions for wartime policies. There should be no talk of material enjoyment, because excessive enjoyment is consumption, and the meaning of wartime life fundamentally prohibits consumption and allows for no enjoyment.</p>
<p>The wartime economy should gradually become production-oriented. In both industry and agriculture, anything needed for the war or related to people's livelihood should focus on increasing production. The quantity of production must increase compared to pre-war levels to meet the needs of the war.</p>
<p>Wartime politics should gradually become efficient. All administrative measures should absolutely not emphasize superficial embellishments or official formalities but should focus on substantial results. At the same time, the political system should gradually adapt to the simplification of wartime, eliminating redundant layers and complex phenomena. To achieve the practical effect of people automatically cooperating in the war, the establishment of institutions for expressing public opinion should be promoted and realized under the supervision of the government.</p>
<p>Wartime culture should gradually become widespread. To enable the general public to understand the meaning of the war, the importance of victory, how to contribute their strength, and how to cooperate with friendly nations, cultural propaganda is undoubtedly a powerful tool to penetrate the people. It must be widely disseminated and its seeds widely planted.</p>
<p>The above four points are merely the most important aspects. If these four points can gradually reach the ideal state, we believe that we will have a better grasp of striving for victory. That is, we will have a better grasp of realizing the "cooperation with our friendly nation of Japan, sweeping away the brutality of Great Britain and the United States, and striving for China's revival and the liberation of East Asia" in the war declaration. However, to put it more positively, since we have already participated in the war, victory is the guarantee of national survival, and it must be absolutely striven for. Anything that is conducive to grasping victory must be absolutely achieved. Under this judgment, the four points mentioned above must become facts and are by no means mere ideals.</p>
<p>However, today is already eight months after participating in the war. Eight months is not a short time. Let us calmly, thoroughly, and realistically examine and reflect on the facts of all aspects today and how much distance there still is from our "ideals." We really do not want to be nitpicking or deliberately fault-finding; however, we also do not want to gloss over the facts or sing empty praises. Therefore, we are willing to adopt an impartial attitude and make an objective analysis as follows:</p>
<p>The people's livelihood has still not gradually become rationalized, and the sharp opposition between hardship and joy remains. Because of the continuous rise in grain and commodity prices, the lives of the poor masses are becoming increasingly unsustainable. They are frowning all day long, struggling with oil, salt, firewood, and rice. On the other hand, the lives of the "wealthy" class are becoming increasingly luxurious and extravagant. The cost of a single banquet can reach tens of thousands of dollars without hesitation, which is truly shocking. Meanwhile, hotels, theaters, and entertainment dens are brightly lit, bustling with people, and fully booked, making hundreds of times the profit. The poor are struggling to figure out how to get enough to eat, while the wealthy are indulging in figuring out how to enjoy themselves to the fullest. Although the suffering and joy are different, those who are indifferent to the victory of the war are no different. The more uneven the living conditions, the weaker the concept of war victory.</p>
<p>The wartime economy has not only failed to increase production but has even shrunk production. The decline in industrial production in Shanghai alone is particularly evident. Those with capital are even more eager to pursue speculative profits, creating a distorted economic situation of skyrocketing prices. Since the government issued the order to purchase yarn and cloth, the severe fluctuations in the economic sector are sufficient to prove the arrogance of all previous speculation and hoarding. The more intensely private interests are pursued, the thinner the concept of social public interest. It is truly difficult to expect them to contribute everything to the war.</p>
<p>Wartime politics has not yet shown any effective performance. Although the political system has been adjusted, substantive efficiency has not been achieved in the end. The main reason is often that there is still a gap with the interests of the people. Therefore, as long as the people do not have the opportunity to participate in politics, public opinion cannot be effectively expressed, and there is still a gap between government measures and public opinion.</p>
<p>Wartime culture has not been promoted universally and remains stagnant and depressed. Spiritual food and material food are equally important. Looking back at the publishing industry in the Japanese cultural sector, it is as widespread and developed as before the war, and paper is still sold for five yuan per ream. The government also fully allocates resources to the publishing industry. Comparing this to Shanghai, where the black market price of paper per ream has risen more than 500 times compared to before the war, the difference is truly vast and staggering. As a result, Shanghai, which has always been the center of publishing in the country, publishes less than five books per month. The pitiful situation is disheartening to talk about. In this situation, the lives of writers are exceptionally difficult, and the lack of thoughtful creation is inevitable. It is truly going in the opposite direction to promote the meaning of the war and raise public awareness.</p>
<p>We believe that the only major possible contribution that China can make to the war is materials. However, obtaining materials depends first on stabilizing the people's livelihood, and then striving to increase production to increase materials. If the people's livelihood cannot be stabilized and production shrinks, materials will inevitably be scarce. How can we talk about cooperating in the war? If this situation cannot be improved urgently, it will not only fail to cooperate in the war but will also increase the wartime responsibilities of friendly nations. As for how to improve the current situation, the only step is to start with improving politics. When politics is on the right track, all aspects of people's livelihood, as well as the economy and culture, can develop normally. People's livelihood will be stabilized from then on, increased production will be realized from then on, and the victory of the war will be achieved from then on. We take this War Participation Memorial Day to state our views and dare to ask both the government and the public to reflect on this.</p>

<h3>Japanese Naval Air Force Active: Fierce Fighting Near Hobart, Two 2,000-Ton Enemy Transport Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – After enemy troops landed near Hobart on New Guinea Island at dawn on the 4th, they gradually increased their forces, attempting to advance.

Immediately, they overcame the fierce resistance of about 20 enemy fighters and bombed them, sinking two 2,000-ton transport ships, one torpedo boat, and destroying one large transport ship. They also set fire to three ammunition storage sites. In addition, they shot down two enemy fighters that came to challenge, a Cactus P40 and a Lockheed P38. All Japanese aircraft returned safely from the mission, with only one airman killed in action.</p>

<h3>Japanese Sportsman Takagi Tsutomu Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – In order to establish close contact with the sports community in our country, the Japanese sports community sent sports expert Takagi Tsutomu to Nanjing to hold discussions with the sports authorities in our country on Greater East Asia sports. The results were very satisfactory, and it was decided that a Greater East Asia Sports League would be established in the future, centered on China, Japan, and Manchukuo. The Chinese side also established the Greater East Asia League China Headquarters. In order to understand this situation, Mr. Takagi specially visited Cao Bangjun, the Director of the Physical Fitness Department of the Ministry of Social Welfare, who is responsible for promoting sports. According to him, the people of our country do not pay much attention to sports, and there is no large-scale sports field in Nanjing. As the next Greater East Asia Sports Games may be held in China, the relevant authorities will plan to build a sports field in order to promote the interest of the people of our country in sports. As for the Greater East Asia Sports League, it has already been finalized and is currently being prepared. It will be established soon. Our country will establish headquarters in Nanjing and branch offices in North China.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Convenes Parliament</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Sofia, Bulgaria convened its parliament on the 8th and scheduled a plenary session for the 9th.</p>
<p>Sofia, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Bulgarian cabinet met yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, with Prime Minister Professor Filov presiding. At the same time, the Zora newspaper reported that the entire country expressed mourning after the death of King Boris, which clearly indicated the public's trust in the late king's policies. It is hoped that the Filov government will continue to follow the same policies.</p>
<h3>National Government Declaration of War</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Great East Asia War on December 8th of the previous year, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with our friendly nation, Japan. Since then, it has begun the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding security and improving people's livelihood, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Great East Asia War. However, countries such as Great Britain and the United States continue to pursue their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and are intensifying their efforts, colluding with the Chongqing faction, participating in the so-called British and American war effort, and sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill each other. Recently, because their forces have been successively defeated by the Japanese army and air force of our friendly nation, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost, they are resorting to even more cunning schemes. Moreover, they are jealous of the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the National Government, and they are constantly inciting the Chongqing faction to harass us in order to obstruct the progress of various construction projects. They are even using their own aircraft, using Chongqing as a base, to carry out indiscriminate bombing in our areas of Wuhan and Guangzhou, harming civilians. The members of the Chongqing faction willingly submit to the dictates of Great Britain and the United States, acting as traitors to East Asia, which is truly shameful. Great Britain and the United States have been plotting against East Asia, using every means to sow discord and division in order to achieve their ultimate goal of annexation, which is what the nations of East Asia should unite against. The National Government hereby declares that from this day forward, we are at war with Great Britain and the United States. We shall exert all our strength, cooperate with our friendly nation of Japan, sweep away the brutality of Great Britain and the United States, and strive for China's revival and the liberation of East Asia. The nations of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations. They are particularly united in their commitment to East Asian co-prosperity. In the future, we should strengthen cooperation to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. Our friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been fighting against the forces of Great Britain and the United States in the West for many years and have repeatedly achieved glorious victories. Our country is now joining the Great East Asia War and will coordinate with them to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All of our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the National Father's Great Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of universal peace and justice all depend on this. We must be of one mind and one heart, working hard from beginning to end, to fulfill the great mission of this great era!</p>

<h3>Two Train Derailments in the United States: Hundreds of Casualties, Suspected of Sabotage</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from New York, the "Congressional Limited," a special express train from Washington to New York, derailed near Philadelphia on the night of the 6th, resulting in hundreds of casualties. In less than ten hours, the "20th Century Limited," a special express train on the New York Central Railroad's connecting line between Chicago and New York, also derailed, resulting in a large number of casualties. The simultaneous occurrence of accidents on the two major railway trunk lines in the United States, centered on New York, seems to have caused a major obstacle to wartime transportation. Although the cause of the above two accidents is still unknown, it seems to be a planned act of sabotage. In particular, the engine of the "20th Century Limited" seemed to have exploded after hitting an animal. The Federal Attorney General's Office in Washington has begun a rigorous investigation.</p>
<h3>German Troops on the Eastern Southern Front Adopt Mobile Warfare Strategy and Withdraw from Stalino According to Plan</h3>

In order to implement a mobile warfare strategy, German troops have withdrawn from the city of Stalino according to a pre-determined plan to shorten the front lines. Before the withdrawal, all military equipment was destroyed. Disregarding heavy losses, enemy forces vigorously attacked German positions in the Kharkov area but were repelled. The enemy launched strong localized offensives at multiple points in the central sector, all of which were repelled after intense fighting. There were no major battles in other sectors of the Eastern Front. Enemy forces continued to launch localized offensives against the bridgehead on the Kompaneevka River, with effective support from German aircraft and troops. Yesterday, enemy forces on the Eastern Front lost a total of 106 tanks and 77 aircraft."</p>

<p>Berlin, August 8th, Central News Agency - According to a military correspondent from Huitong News Agency: "The defensive battles on the southern sector of the Eastern Front are intensifying. Soviet forces have deployed fresh troops to join the battle, while German troops continue to employ elastic defense tactics, abandoning more territory in the Donets Basin. The German retreat is ongoing, with German rear guards suppressing the pursuing Soviet forces and inflicting considerable losses. The Soviet advance from Izyum towards the Dnieper River has been halted. Southwest of Kharkov, Soviet forces continue to advance towards Krasnograd, encountering strong German resistance. The Soviet advance east of Poltava has also been unsuccessful. Soviet pressure west of Glukhov and near Konotop is very strong. The enemy's vanguard has reached the northeastern outskirts of Konotop, and fighting is still ongoing. The enemy has resumed its offensive south of Bryansk, but the Soviet attempt to encircle the city from the north has stalled. The situation east of Kirovograd and Smolensk remains unchanged. Localized Soviet offensives have been repelled."</p>

Enemy supply lines were attacked by German aircraft, destroying three important bridges. German aircraft conducted night raids on several key Soviet railway junctions, destroying a train loaded with ammunition, and severely damaging railway tracks. German anti-aircraft defenses destroyed 144 Soviet tanks, while another 17 were destroyed by the German air force. German fighters and anti-aircraft artillery shot down 60 enemy aircraft, with the German side losing only eight aircraft."</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, August 8th, Central News Agency - Well-informed sources in Washington stated today: "Prime Minister Churchill has no intention of leaving Washington for Europe in the next few days." It is said that Churchill's delayed departure may indicate that a major event will occur in the near future.</p>
<h3>Mountbatten Busy Preparing to Take Office</h3>
<p>Lisbon, August 8th, Central News Agency - According to reports from London, the newly appointed Supreme Commander of the Anti-Axis Forces in Southeast Asia, Lord Mountbatten, is currently very active in London, spending most of his time preparing to take office. It is reported that he had lunch yesterday with former Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and Indian Secretary Amery, and later met with the Ambassador of the Republic of China to Britain, Gu Weijun, and the new Viceroy of India, Field Marshal Wavell. London military circles believe that Mountbatten is currently a lieutenant general, but due to the importance of his new appointment, he may be promoted to full general despite being only 43 years old.</p>
<p>German Experts Discuss the Indian Ocean Situation</p>
<p>Berlin, August 8th, Central News Agency - In his paper speculating on whether the Indian Ocean will become a focal point of the war, Dr. Hafecht stated: "The appointment of General Mountbatten as the supreme commander of the Anglo-American forces in East Asia is a result of the Quebec Conference. This action is an admission by the Anti-Axis powers of their failure in the war against Japan. President Roosevelt decided to take decisive action against Japan due to pressure from domestic political circumstances. In 1940, President Roosevelt deceived the American public by saying that providing material assistance to Britain would preserve the United States itself. By underestimating the strength of the Japanese military, the United States was suddenly attacked at Pearl Harbor, and the United States focused its strength on Europe while neglecting the defense of the Pacific. At the Quebec Conference, President Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Churchill to bear a greater burden of the war in the Pacific than Britain had previously contributed. This proves that the United States cannot independently decide the war in East Asia, but it is not yet clear whether General Stilwell and General MacArthur are under his command and what Mountbatten's operational responsibilities are. As a result of the development of the Mediterranean war, the British Navy has increased its freedom of action in Southeast Asia. The British Navy was bound to the Mediterranean region, but after the conquest of Tunisia and Sicily, the danger of the situation has decreased, so Britain can redeploy its forces and send reinforcements to the Indian Ocean. For this reason, the focus of the world war will now shift to the gateway of India, which is not unexpected. Europe may not be very interested in the future developments in Southeast Asia, but the events that occur there will affect Europe, just as European events can affect the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<h3>Egypt and the Soviet Union Establish Diplomatic Relations</h3>

<h3>Anglo-American Air Raids on Germany Suffer Heavy Losses; Up to Seventy Aircraft Lost in One Day</h3>
<p>Berlin, August 8th, Central News Agency - The U.S. Air Force bombed Stuttgart on the morning of the 6th. The British Air Force then bombed Munich on the night of the 6th. According to German authorities, German forces shot down 51 U.S. bombers over Stuttgart and 15 British bombers over Munich. In addition, six bombers crashed within Swiss territory or were forced to land due to mechanical failures. Therefore, the Anti-Axis forces lost about 72 heavy bombers and 700 crew members in the bombing on that day. In general, each Anti-Axis air raid uses 200 to 300 heavy bombers, so if 500 are used day and night, the damage is over 15%. German authorities also claim that the losses suffered by the U.S. Air Force during bombing raids on German soil are gradually increasing. 30 heavy bombers were lost in the bombing of Hanover and Hamburg on July 26, 35 were lost in the bombing of Kassel on July 28, 52 were lost in the bombing of Romanian oilfields on August 1, and another 15 crashed in neutral countries. 37 were lost in the bombing of Ploesti on August 12.</p>
<h3>A Review of Germany's Domestic and International Situation on the Fourth Anniversary of the European War</h3>
<p>Since the flames of war in Europe were ignited in a corner of Poland (the city of Danzig), today marks the fourth anniversary. During this period, the characteristic that dominated the European war situation was the initial and most urgent fact for the Axis powers since the start of the war: the Soviet Union launching its first summer offensive on the Eastern Front. The war situation undoubtedly encountered a major turning point. The Mediterranean front was also under threat. In Western Europe, the opportunity to open a second front, at the fervent request of the Soviet Union, suddenly became more promising. This urgent situation surrounding the fortress of Europe can indeed be described as Germany's "lack of vigor" compared to this time last year. However, when examining the essence and accurately grasping future trends, although the German army retreated somewhat due to the Red Army's first summer offensive, the impression given in concept was rather exaggerated. When examining the facts in detail, no "astonishing changes" occurred.</p>
<p>The Springboard for the Great Offensive</p>
<p>Compared to the beginning of this year, the current state of German-Soviet confrontation only shows that about one-thirtieth of the total area, including Orel, Kharkov, and their vicinity in the central region, has been recovered by the Soviet army. Moreover, this retreat in the central region is also due to the necessity of a new operational strategy called "bleeding tactics," which is of course inferior to last year's large-scale "territory-grabbing offensive." So how will the German army cope with the Eastern Front in the future? What medicine is Germany selling in the gourd? People are quite suspicious. The Klauswitz report stated: "Defenders must change to offensive tactics depending on the situation, but offensive forces cannot simply switch to defensive tactics." The German army's "bleeding tactics" are precisely to anticipate the occurrence of several frontal battles, to establish a long-term, undefeated posture aimed at defending the European continent, and to prevent the Soviet Union from launching a winter offensive. The German counteroffensive is of course planned to be implemented immediately after the current retreat.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned operational methods are now progressing very effectively. The Soviet army only broke through 50 kilometers west of Orel and Kharkov, but the price paid was the loss of 160 tank brigades and 1.6 million soldiers. Therefore, the current retreat is being viewed by the German army as a valuable "springboard." So although the German army is said to be "declining," it is still maintaining a confrontation line of more than 2,000 kilometers, penetrating more than 1,000 kilometers from its own territory into enemy territory. Therefore, it is difficult to judge the overall gains and losses based on a local battle.</p>
<p>European Defense is Impenetrable</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the European landing operation that the British and Americans are calling for. After occupying Sicily, the Anti-Axis powers are now eyeing the Italian mainland with great interest. As the Soviet Union pointed out, if the British and Americans attempt to invade the European continent, they will have to fight the German army to the death. However, according to the various situations and intelligence of the month, the British and Americans seem to have no determination to go all-in. The British and Americans boasted that after the end of the North African War, they could save millions of tons of ships on the roundabout Cape Town route, but even in the Battle of Sicily, it took half a year of preparation. Even if a landing on the Italian mainland were to succeed temporarily, the Axis front would ultimately not be shaken.</p>
<p>Relying on the majority, the British and Americans have already spent five weeks occupying Sicily, and the losses suffered by the British and Americans during this period are countless. In short, the German army, whether for the Eastern Front, the Southern Front, or other fronts that may be opened in the future, will take a passive operational approach, that is, defensive tactics, in order to accumulate combat power. This is already discernible now.</p>
<p>In order to accumulate combat power, the air force is also willing to endure the terror bombing of the British and Americans and grit its teeth and endure with the people. Once this suppressed emotion erupts due to the accumulated combat power, the European war situation will have a clear development. The above-mentioned view of the war situation has become the foundation of the German national spirit, which has suffered all kinds of hardships.</p>
<p>The Domestic Situation is Also Complete</p>
<p>In the past four years, the degree of hardship in various aspects of German national life has increased year by year. Especially since this year, as a result of the implementation of the general citizen mobilization plan, about 60% of the shops in Berlin, which have no practical connection with the war, have been closed. In view of the situation of the Hamburg air raids, it is planned to evacuate one million citizens from Berlin, and the color of the decisive battle seems to be becoming more thorough.</p>

<h3>Fierce Rearguard Action in the Mountainous Areas of Southern Italy; British Troops Land in Ufemia</h3>
<p>Berlin, August 8th, Central News Agency - The German Führer's Headquarters announced at noon on the 8th: "Anti-Axis forces landed in Ufemia in Calabria, southern Italy, on the night of the 7th. Since dawn on the 8th, Axis forces have been fiercely attacking the landing forces."</p>
<p>Berlin, August 8th, Central News Agency - The British Eighth Army under Montgomery has made no progress since occupying the ancient city of Palmero in Calabria. The troops attempting to attack north of the city were ambushed by German troops, suffering heavy losses and retreating. On the central front, the troops attempting to advance to Garigliano were blocked by the steep mountainous terrain and seem unable to advance. The British advance on the southern front is also very slow. German authorities believe that the Anti-Axis operation against Calabria is merely a diversionary operation to open up landings in other areas.</p>
<p>Berlin, August 8th, Central News Agency - The German New Open Press special correspondent for the Mediterranean region, Börner, stated: "Near Gidsatauro on the coastal road leading northeast from Reggio, British troops fought with the German rearguard for several hours, suffering heavy losses. The British troops suffered heavy losses because they failed to break through the German defensive artillery line, so they continued to advance slowly, trying to avoid contact with the German-Italian rearguard. Enemy troops continue to land in Sperlonga, seemingly attempting to enter the rear of the German rearguard."</p>
<p>Rome, August 8th, Central News Agency - On the 7th, Italian military sources reported on the landing of the British Eighth Army in Calabria and the progress of subsequent operations as follows: "The Anti-Axis forces, possessing superior weapons, used all naval guns and all land artillery to fiercely attack the Italian artillery line along the southern coast of Calabria, including Villa San Giovanni, Reggio, and Saline. In addition, a large fleet of several battleships opened fire together, and land artillery fire on the coast of Scilla was also quite intense. In addition, a large formation of bombers dropped bombs from the sky, but the Axis forces still resisted valiantly under this situation, inflicting great damage on some of the landing enemy forces. The residents of the combat zone had been moved to safe areas in the rear in advance. The garrison is currently repelling enemy troops landing along the coastline, but due to the excessive Anti-Axis shelling, it had to temporarily retreat. At this time, the Anti-Axis forces used landing craft to continuously land tanks and small and medium-caliber guns, and the Axis forces immediately launched a thorough attack on them, inflicting heavy damage. However, the number of heavy guns and tanks transported by the enemy was very large. Therefore, although the Axis forces launched a brave assault, the enemy finally landed with a large number of heavy guns and tanks in the area from San Giovanni to Sapri. In addition, the Anti-Axis forces used paratroopers to assist the landing forces, but they have already been inflicted with considerable damage by the Axis forces. The war is now being waged within several kilometers of the coastline, but that area is a famous mountainous area, and the Axis forces, resisting from a strategically advantageous position, are very fierce, causing the Anti-Axis advance to be slow."</p>
<h3>Vatican Convenes Episcopal Conference</h3>
<p>Vatican City, August 8th, Central News Agency - Secretary of State Maglione paid a visit to the Pope yesterday to report on the deliberations of Monday's Episcopal Conference.

<h3>Italy Orders the Dissolution of the Reserve Officers' Corps</h3>
<p>Rome, August 8th, Central News Agency - The commander of the military district, General Tumelin, yesterday ordered the dissolution of the Reserve Officers' Corps.</p>
<p>Rome, August 8th, Central News Agency - An official announcement yesterday stated: "The Badoglio government issued an order temporarily banning the sending of telegrams abroad when it was formed. This ban has now been lifted."</p>
<h3>Burma Celebrates Independence by Issuing National Construction Bonds</h3>

<h3>Agreements Signed for Loans from Banks to Purchase Grain; Rice and Grain Control Committee May Be Established Within the Month</h3>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reporter learned that the relevant authorities in this city, in order to thoroughly stabilize the people's food supply and guarantee their livelihoods, have decided to borrow a large sum of money from banks to purchase and store food, so that the people can be supplied with their normal needs. This matter was negotiated by the relevant authorities in a certain district and a major bank, and an agreement has been signed. This shows the determination of the local authorities to improve the grain policy with all their efforts. It is also reported that regarding the procurement and distribution of rice and grain, the Materials Control Review Committee has resolved that the matter will be transferred from the Ministry of Food to the National Commercial Control Association, and a Rice and Grain Control Committee will be formed under the Commercial Control Association to take charge. This committee is currently being organized, and its office will be located in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce once it is established.</p>
<p>The Later-Established Joint Grain Cooperative Society Will Be Dissolved</p>
<p>The food problem of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai is deeply valued by people from all walks of life. In particular, Shanghai, with millions of people living in non-productive areas, is even more eager for rice and grain from the inland production areas to be transported in to regulate the food supply. Since the Ministry of Food planned to implement the method of controlling the procurement, transportation, and distribution of rice and grain, the distribution of rice to households has not been on time and in sufficient quantity due to various reasons and the imperfect organization of the agencies in charge of rice and grain procurement. In view of this, the authorities, after research by the relevant parties, decided to reorganize the rice and grain control mechanism in order to improve the food needs of the people. It is heard that the National Commercial Control Association drafted the rice and grain control plan and submitted it to the sixth meeting of the Materials Control Review Committee for discussion and approval. Regarding the reorganization of the future rice procurement agency, the National Commercial Control Association will set up a Rice and Grain Control Committee. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was designated by the Executive Yuan as the chairman of the preparation committee. Lin Kanghou, Chen Guangzhong, Zai Ailu, Ji Hua, Chen Ziyi, Yang Heqing, He Quansheng, Yan Ji, and Luo Nazhai were appointed as members of the preparation committee. Yuan will convene the members to hold the first preparatory meeting within the next few days to discuss the preparatory steps, formulate organizational rules, and solve problems such as rice procurement, transportation, and distribution. It can be organized and established by the end of this month at the latest. As for the rice and grain joint cooperative societies in the Shanghai area and other areas, they will be dissolved when the Rice and Grain Control Committee is announced, and all business operations will be transferred to the committee for management.</p>
<p>Rice Ration Must Be Brought Back on Track</p>
<p>The current borrowing of rice from the Chinese Rice Distribution Association by the Economic Department of the First District Office in this month's rice ration is a temporary expedient, so the quantity is also less than during the normal ration period (two sheng per period before July). Therefore, this situation cannot be allowed to continue and must be brought back on track as soon as possible. The new rice and grain operation agency has a necessary urgency to catch up with the procurement and transportation of rice and grain. According to a Datong News Agency report, Yang Heqing, one of the members announced in the list of members of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, expressed his rejection of the position yesterday. However, the citizens pay close attention to the food organization and cannot afford to hesitate.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the sales of rice for the 21st period to households in the first and second districts of the fourth district of this city have been stopped a few days ago. The 22nd period of rice for households, totaling 2,150 bags (brown rice), has also been processed and shipped by the Joint Cooperative Office of the district. It could have been distributed immediately, but the rice purchase certificates for this time were only issued by the office to the first and second district offices for transfer to each Lianbao and each household starting yesterday (the 8th), so the procedures may be delayed for a few days. Generally, it can be sold around this Friday (the 10th).</p>
<h3>Hand-Woven Native Cloth Is Not Controlled; Tax-Free Transportation Is Still Permitted; Apply for a License from Local Tax Bureaus</h3>
<p>Since the government authorities have taken control and purchase of cotton cloth, it is no longer allowed to be transported to other ports. However, hand-woven native cloth is not within the scope of control, so it can still be freely transported and sold.

When native cloth transporting and selling merchants report the transportation of native cloth, they should first obtain a certificate from the local cloth shop or silk and satin industry association, that is, the native cloth transportation license application meeting, and submit it to the association for stamping and certification, and then submit it to the local tax authorities to fill out and issue the native cloth transportation license. Filling out and issuing native cloth transportation licenses is purely for the purpose of maintaining the livelihood of the poor, and no taxes will be collected.

<h3>Shanghai's First Hospital Run by a Woman: A Visit to the Ximenwai Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics Hospital</h3>
<p>Dedicated Treatment of Obstetrics, Gynecology, Pediatrics and Other Departments; Complete Modern Mechanical Medical Equipment</p>
<p>The red bus takes you to Foshuli Road and walk south along Delas Road for about 200 meters. In front of you is the always quiet Xujiahui Road. The large area of ​​lush green gardens north of Huajiabang occasionally has a fresh and beautiful breeze, which sweeps away people's worldly thoughts. Looking to the right, you can see white Western-style buildings, as if they were specially embedded in the strange sky and white clouds, how beautiful! The plaque on the iron gate tells you that this is the first hospital in Shanghai run by a woman and especially focusing on saving the poor and sick: "Ximenwai Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics Hospital"</p>
<p>From the Red House to the White House</p>
<p>Ximenwai Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics Hospital, commonly known as the "Red House Hospital", was established nearly 60 years ago. It was founded in 1884 by American doctor Dr. Luo and was located in the Red House on Fangxie Road, Ximen. It was a highly reputable hospital in Shanghai. Later, it was jointly run by enthusiastic believers of the Christian Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, and the Women's Public Association. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, affected by the Shanghai War, they had to tearfully bid farewell to their old residence and moved to this "White House" at 850 Xujiahui Road, which was formerly the Niu Huisheng Orthopedic Hospital, and started operating again. Because the area is relatively remote, in order to continue to relieve the poor and sick, they also rented the old Niu Hui Orthopedic Hospital at 334 Foch Road (at the intersection of Cheng Road) as the "Ximenwai Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics Hospital Clinic Branch", and most of the new and old patients go to the branch for consultation.</p>
<p>In recent years, the general public has suffered from the impact of the current situation and prices, and there are poor and sick people everywhere. However, on the contrary, there are many hospitals or doctors who have been engaged in poverty and sickness relief work, but they have temporarily suspended operations due to various reasons. Therefore, there are countless people in the market who are unable to seek medical treatment and are waiting to die. The hospital naturally cannot bear to see this, so since May last year, despite the difficulties and disadvantages, they resolutely took over the Columbia Road People's Clinic, which was previously established by foreign doctors, and provided free medical treatment and medicine three times a week, specializing in treating the diseases of the coolies and their families in the nearby shantytowns. Since May this year, she has also taken on the role of voluntary clinic doctor for the Poor Children's Nursery Home once a week. Although their strength is limited and they cannot universally save all the poor and sick in society, they have done their best. As the saying goes, "Give a point of strength, give a point of light," striving to reduce the pain of the general poor compatriots.</p>
<p>Doctors, by nature, take eliminating the pain of patients as their highest goal. Hospitals and charitable organizations, in theory, should not have too much distance. However, in the current unhealthy society, we cannot expect every doctor and hospital to understand the great righteousness and sacrifice to serve. Often, those who are too seriously ill to be cured are rejected. One can imagine the suffering of the patient's family. Ximen Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics Hospital is particularly vigilant about this. As long as there is a breath of life left, except for infectious diseases that are transferred to infectious disease hospitals, all others are not rejected, and they try their best to save them. Often, they recapture life, and they are unspeakably happy. According to the hospital director, about 1,600 patients are hospitalized each year, and 16,600 patients are treated as outpatients. The mortality rate of patients in the hospital is extremely low. In the recent two-year records, including those who died before they could be treated, the mortality rate in the 31st year was 2.9%, and in the 32nd year it was 2.1%.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Women's Ward</p>
<p>Walking into the gate of Ximen Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics Hospital, you are greeted by a piece of land with lush impatiens swaying in the morning light, full of vitality. Although it was still early, the staff of the outpatient department were already preparing for their daily diagnosis and treatment work. The waiting room is not very big, but it is very clean and refreshing, like a rest room in a garden. It is said that not only do they not charge consultation fees for general poor patients, but they also often give them medicines, and those with serious illnesses have to be hospitalized.</p>
<p>Inside the outpatient department is the pharmacy. This is different from the simple dispensary in general hospitals. They have relatively complete equipment and have a full-time pharmacist in charge. In addition to the common medicines, they also regularly engage in pharmaceutical manufacturing and pharmaceutical research. There are certain procedures for the allocation of medicines needed by each patient, careful preparation, and careful review. The employees here understand the relationship between their every move and the patient's life.</p>
<p>The wards are divided into grades like ordinary hospitals, but they are divided according to the degree of the patient's illness, and they are not necessarily only based on the amount of fees charged. Some of the third-class wards can accommodate more than ten beds in one room, but they do not seem crowded. Most of the third-class wards only have two beds in one room. Because they are diligent in cleaning, they do not feel the peculiar smell of the hospital, but they have the care encountered in the hospital. Patients in the third class can pay a smaller fee, but the enjoyment is not necessarily worse than the first and second classes. Some people who are really unable to pay the fee can be exempted from payment.</p>
<p>Most of the first and second class wards are upstairs. The characteristic here is the interior. In addition to being scientific, they also pay attention to art. The soft light, the pleasing wall decorations, plus one or two not-too-strong fresh flowers, and the permission for family members to come and accompany them (of course, they have to abide by the hospital's rules). In this way, from the patient's psychology, the pain suffered is reduced. The lighter one leans back and reads a book, and closes his eyes and raises his head for a while, whether he is resting or meditating? The smile beside him inadvertently tells the visitor of his satisfaction with the hospital.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the focus of the women's and children's hospital's service is still on the third-class ward. There are 147 beds in the whole hospital, but there are only 11 in the first class, and only 45 in the second class, while there are 91 in the third class. They will do their best to treat those who are able to pay the more expensive medical fees, but they will never neglect the poor patients.</p>
<p>A Visit to the Consultation Room</p>
<p>The consultation room seems to be a place that easily evokes people's feelings of pain, but the sincere service spirit and gentle attitude of the doctors and nurses can make up for this lack of feeling.</p>
<p>In the children's ward, there was a chorus of children's cries. Dr. Huang Shuzhen, the attending physician of pediatrics, was treating a patient with dysentery who was already in a dangerous period. After a while, she breathed a sigh of relief and said: Okay, this little life can be saved! Without talking to others, she went to treat another little patient. The sick children in the first-class children's ward were attended by family members, and their emotions were relatively calm. The director proudly praised this young attending physician of pediatrics. After graduating from Shanghai Women's Medical College in 1935, she interned at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and then went to the hospital to work as a pediatrician. Because of her enthusiasm and responsibility, she was "daily governed" and promoted to attending physician of pediatrics last year.</p>
<p>The arrangement and equipment of the gynecological treatment room is still rare in Shanghai. Dr. Wang Shuzhen, the attending physician, graduated from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1925 and has been serving in the hospital since 1926. From 1931 to 1939, she also served as a full-time teacher of gynecology at the Women's Medical College. She carefully explained the equipment and its functions in gynecological treatment. She said that in order to serve patients conscientiously, she can save her own life to the lowest level, but the necessary tools for medical treatment must be as complete as possible.</p>
<p>The delivery room is almost never idle. There are two state-of-the-art delivery beds, accompanied by cribs and other surgical instruments. There are washing rooms and disinfection rooms nearby. The sterilizer is still steaming. The mothers and newborn babies all have special rooms. The mother's room is full of an atmosphere of peace and joy. It is not very bright, but the air is fresh. When the nurse is holding the newborn baby for milk, the mother's pale face shows a grateful and happy smile after the pain.</p>
<p>In a small iron bed, the red baby's face is moving, how lovely! The nurses are busy taking care of them.</p>
<h3>Administrative Yuan Orders Designation of Penal Authority for Illegal Cases of Buying and Selling Yarn and Cloth; Materials Investigation Committee to Be Responsible for Investigation and Arrest</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Executive Yuan ordered the National Commercial Control General Association that Articles 3, 6, 7, and 8 of the Provisional Regulations on Buying and Selling Yarn and Cotton Cloth previously promulgated have various restrictions and penalties. The investigation matters have been ordered to the Shanghai Materials Investigation Committee to be responsible for handling. Regarding the enforcement agency for penalties, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has been ordered to designate the Shanghai District Court to handle it in accordance with the law. In addition, regarding the disposal of confiscated goods, the Shanghai Materials Investigation Committee has also been ordered to execute it jointly with the Shanghai District Court and then hand it over to the committee for safekeeping and reporting. After receiving the order, the Commercial Control Association immediately sent a letter to the Cotton Products Industry Association to forward it to all member trade associations to inform all members to comply.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Sugar for the Sixth Term Household Registration Is Quite Humid, Reportedly Due to Excessive Storage Time</h3>
<p>The sugar for the sixth term of household registration in this city was not sold previously due to the relationship between the wholesale price. It is now learned that the wholesale price formulated by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative has not been approved by the authorities, and the citizens' demand for sugar is very high, so it has been decided to continue to sell it at the original price. The first and eighth districts have been widely implemented since yesterday, with each person still limited to half a catty, priced at 2.35 yuan. Other districts are scheduled to start selling in mid-September. The sale of sugar for the fifth term in Nanshi will end today. It is found that most of the sugar sold in this term is humid. According to the sugar merchants themselves, the time between the sugar being released from the factory and the date of sale by the retail sugar merchants is as long as 40 days. It happened to be during the hot season, so the sugar melted due to the heat, and some of it was sugar stored more than six months ago, which caused complaints from the outside world.</p>
<p>The Eighth District Cancels the Two-Percent Retail Tax</p>
<p>Residents of the eighth district of this city had to pay a 2% retail tax when buying sugar during the time of the former French Municipal Council. Since this term, the eighth district public office has cancelled it, so residents of the district can no longer pay this two-percent tax in the future. This is also the first time it has been implemented after the takeover of the concession.</p>
<p>Special Sugar Allocation Begins; Commercial Cooperation Department gives special allocation of sugar required for business operations to various industries, which is handled by the Special Sugar Allocation Office of the department. It was shelved previously due to the sugar price issue, but now that the authorities have approved the department's report to calculate it at the original price, this special sugar allocation has also begun. After receiving the notice from the department, companies and firms in various industries should exchange the sugar collection certificate within the time limit and pay the designated sugar firm to pick up the goods at 9.4 yuan per catty, and the 2% retail tax has also been cancelled.</p>
<p>Strict Management of Retail Sugar Shops</p>
<p>The Economic Department of the First District Public Office of Shanghai Special City continues to strictly manage the sale of household registration sugar by the Type A retail sugar shops. Each Type A retail sugar shop must report the quantity of sugar sold in each term in a truthful manner and submit the received sugar purchase certificates for verification by the department to prevent fraud.</p>
<p>There Is No Forced Purchase of Gold Jewelry; Citizens Are Requested Not to Believe Rumors</p>
<p>In recent days, there have been rumors in this city that unscrupulous people are forcing women to sell gold jewelry, which is enough to disturb the public. In order to clarify the truth, this reporter inquired with the police. It is said that "no relevant authorities in this city have sent anyone to buy gold jewelry, which is an illegal excuse. If such incidents occur in the future, it is hoped that the victims will report to the police station or the self-defense organization and hand them over to the police authorities, who will handle them in accordance with the law. It is hoped that citizens will not believe the rumors and suffer losses."</p>
<h3>The City Party Department Schedules to Handle the Handover</h3>

<h3>The Thrift Movement Association Is Recruiting the Second Batch of Members; It Has Never Solicited Donations From the Outside; Citizens Must Not Be Deceived</h3>

Citizens who wish to join can go to the Preparatory Office of the association at the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association on the fourth floor, or the Shanghai Press Association at 160 Edward Road.

<h3>Vegetable Prices Are Still Higher Than General Levels</h3>
<p>Vegetable market prices are high. The Central Market is trying to stabilize them. Recently, it has achieved some success. Large quantities of vegetables have recently arrived, so the supply has increased. Although market prices have fallen back, they are still higher than general levels. It is said that it is due to increased transportation costs. The Central Market and other relevant authorities are still continuing to find ways to improve.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Epidemic Injection Ends</h3>
<p>The anti-epidemic movement in this city ended at the end of last month. The health offices in each district will end the injection service from this month. According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter: At present, residents of this city who still need anti-epidemic injections can apply to the Hankou Road Health Office without charge. The effectiveness of the anti-epidemic this year is rare in history. There has been no discovery of genuine cholera, which is very gratifying. However, the authorities believe that it is now the cool autumn season, and diseases such as dysentery may still be prevalent, so they hope that residents will pay attention to their health.</p>
<p>Comments from the Economic World</p>
<h3>Explanation of "Contribution"</h3>
<p>The uneasiness in the business community since the purchase of yarn and cloth is due to insufficient understanding of the matter. We have already said this many times. We should pay attention to the important conversation made by the Japanese ambassador to China the other day, in which there are several sentences that are worth everyone's attention: "The mission and importance of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth depend on how it will be handled in the future. How much contribution this major measure will make to low prices and stable people's livelihood will depend on how China and Japan cooperate in the future."</p>
<p>If we analyze these concise words, it is not difficult to add another layer of understanding to the matter. The mission and importance of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth, as well as purchasing major essential materials other than cotton yarn and cloth, lies in striving towards a common goal of low prices and stable people's livelihood, so as to make a contribution. What is the explanation of the word "contribution"? Broadly speaking, "contribution" means achievement; strictly speaking, contribution means supply and subsidy. How the government supplies what the people need and subsidizes what the people lack is the government's true contribution to the people. As for how much contribution can be made, as Ambassador Gu said, it depends on how China and Japan cooperate.</p>
<h3>The City's Industrial and Commercial Circles Plan to Restore Trade with Nanyang; Hope to Assist in Overcoming Shipping Difficulties</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, traffic between Shanghai and various parts of Nanyang has been interrupted, and various kinds of trade have come to a standstill. Before the incident, the annual trade volume between Shanghai and Nanyang was extremely considerable. Various materials were transported from Nanyang to Shanghai, and its manufactured products were sold well in various parts of Nanyang. Therefore,</p>
<p>Trade Stagnation</p>
<p>has a significant impact on the development of the city's industrial and commercial circles. According to a business magnate in the city's industrial and commercial circles yesterday: In order to normalize the overall economic development of Shanghai, the industrial, commercial, and financial circles of the city have long intended to restore trade with Nanyang. They have gathered with relevant authorities several times in the past, but there is no concrete plan yet. Recently, the industrial and commercial circles believe that this matter.</p>
<p>Cannot Be Delayed</p>
<p>Therefore, they have been working hard in recent days. The most difficult thing at present is that the shipping is very unsmooth. They will make the greatest efforts to request the assistance of the authorities, because if trade with Nanyang is not smooth, the industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai will not be able to</p>
<p>Fully Develop</p>
<p>A few days ago, some factories were forced to stop work because they could not obtain raw materials from abroad, and there are also solid products that cannot be sold well, resulting in a reduction in production quantities. Therefore, they deeply hope that the authorities will fully assist them to overcome this difficulty.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Matches Awaiting Distribution</h3>
<p>The local match association, regarding the match distribution matter, has heard that the distribution plan still needs to be thoroughly discussed by the Commercial Control Commission, and therefore cannot be implemented soon. As for the matches prepared for distribution, various factories have already produced a large quantity, amounting to several thousand boxes, which are currently awaiting distribution. It is also understood that the match distribution system will be implemented in Shanghai first, and then gradually promoted in the inland areas.</p>

Therefore, Qiu Zunqing has been specially appointed as the director of the Ningbo branch office, and Wang Wenyuan as the director of the Bengbu branch office, to go to prepare for the establishment, which is expected to be completed in mid-month.</p>
<h3>Good Harvest of Coarse Grains in North China, Increased Oil Production is Optimistic</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 8th (Central News Agency) – Due to the increase in cultivated land and favorable rainfall, the harvest of coarse grains in North China this year is expected to be higher than last year.

The flax and mustard seeds in the Mengjiang area are also expected to increase by 40% compared to last year. Therefore, with the bumper harvest of these oil-producing plants, the increase in oil production is optimistic.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were uncertain. After opening in the morning, the market was small. At noon, due to the news of Wing On Textile's capital increase, it suddenly rose, and various stocks were brought up. In the afternoon, the situation returned to a consolidation, with most stocks slightly lower than the previous day. People's hearts were uneasy, and trading gradually became more active. It was seen that there were buyers active in the low price range. Wing On Textile saw a small consolidation in the morning, but after 12 o'clock, sporadic buyers suddenly appeared, and the price rose sharply. It once rose by one level in the afternoon, finally closing higher than the previous day. Dasheng No. 1 Factory was flat, and No. 3 Factory was slightly lower. Qingfeng Textile opened slightly lower. Dagong Dyeing and Weaving traded more than double the par value. Xinyi, Wuhe, Zhen , Hongsheng, and Greater China Weaving all fell first and then rebounded slightly.

<h3>Summary of Commercial Situation</h3>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday's unified government bond market turned from stable to downward, and the trend was still consolidating and weak, with people's hearts uncertain. However, there were rebounds from small declines, and the brewing state is still temporary. The C-type opened actively, but after sellers dumped, it became weak. Other types had little activity.</p>
<p>Western Medicine: Recently, due to the influence of rumors of control, buyers disappeared, and scattered hoarding frequently led to dumping. Raw material prices and finished products all declined.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk: Transactions were deserted, the industry was calm, and the market remained sluggish. Prices remained at a low point.</p>
<p>Grains: Yesterday, due to rain, vendors were scarce. Prices were called higher at the beginning of the morning, but they weakened again due to sluggish actual sales. There were no major changes in rice reserves and oil prices compared to before.</p>
<p>Interbank Loan Rate: The interbank loan rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 2.3%.</p>
<p>Tea: Actual sales in the street have not progressed, people's hearts continue to be unexcited, and those who hold goods continue to supply, so the market price has not changed much. The whole city's Wuchang Tea Company took in eight boxes of black tea, and at the same time , Tai Tea Shop absorbed more than ten packages of black tea seeds. The above was sold by Yuxing Tea Shop. As for other varieties, no one is still interested, but only the black tea core , Xinya Chemical Plant still has , but they are trying to suppress the price and take advantage of it, and the household, due to cost reasons, is unwilling to be too cheap , so today, only both parties each reduced the price, especially in actual transactions.</p>

<p>Public Life</p>
<h3>Bank Trainee</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yi</p>
<p>The general idea is that the job of a banker is a golden rice bowl, both stable and well-paid. So in the winter of 1940, I got the opportunity through a relative's introduction to participate in the trainee examination of a well-known commercial bank. When the admission notice was sent to my house, the whole family was overjoyed, and relatives and friends came to congratulate me, thinking that from then on my career would be stable and I could be free from worry about life.</p>
<p>With a happy heart, I ran into the bank's building in the new year of 1941 and officially started working as a trainee with humility and hard work. Although I felt unfamiliar and ignorant at the time, I had a great interest in everything, holding the belief that as long as I didn't do anything wrong and worked diligently and thriftily, I would be promoted to a bank clerk, promoted to a director, and become a manager in the future, with unlimited hope. I immersed myself in learning what I should do while dreaming of a beautiful future.</p>
<p>The name trainee, as the name implies, is established by the bank itself to cultivate useful talents. Its work should focus on making the trainee understand the bank's business; its salary is of course much lower than that of a bank clerk. Who knew that since I started work last year, I have been assigned to a job and have not been transferred to other departments for practice for two and a half years. At first, I felt that I didn't understand the things in this department, and it was difficult, but after I got familiar with it in a few days, I have been doing it mechanically every day until now. I am already extremely bored with the things I have done. I still don't know anything about other departments. The expectation that I would be able to make achievements as long as I worked hard in the early days has turned into smoke. Prices are rising step by step, and life is becoming more difficult. Many relatives and friends are spending their days with sad faces. Knowing that I work in a big bank, they always say, "You are relaxed! Your life is better than ours." Who would believe that what I earn every month is less than the income of a rickshaw puller! A bank clerk in a national bank and a few very few commercial banks can easily have an income of about 2,000. In our bank, a bank clerk's salary and benefits together are less than 1,000 yuan. We trainees only have a subsidy of 400 yuan per month. The regular salary was 16 yuan after the three-month probationary period from the year before last until now, and it has not increased. Who would believe that a person who sits in a magnificent bank building and handles millions of dollars every day cannot eat enough porridge at home because they cannot afford oil and eat boiled vegetables, and do not use soap for washing because soap is expensive!</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers can wear torn clothes and eat coarse food, but a trainee cannot wear shorts and go to work barefoot. They usually work with bank clerks, and they cannot not socialize when others have weddings and funerals. The tea servant follows behind and calls them "Mr." During the New Year and holidays, they cannot not spend money because they are trainees. "The rice bowl of the banking industry is golden." This sentence was probably accurate in another era. Now, the rice bowl of the banking industry is like the northwest wind, the more you drink it, the colder it gets, and the more you eat it, the hungrier you get.</p>
<p>Factories use child labor and female workers, not to extensively cultivate technical talents in addition to male workers, but so that the bosses can save some wages. Banks use trainees, nominally to cultivate banking talents. In fact, it is also to save a sum of money. Our daily work is no different from that of bank clerks, and our responsibilities are of course the same as those of bank clerks. One-third of the trainees in the entire bank are doing the work of clerks, which is very obvious.</p>
<p>The bank where I work is not a small bank, and of course there are many people like me and even worse than us. I am not only appealing for the treatment of trainees, but if this continues, the entire banking industry will be bleak.</p>

<h3>Fourth Anniversary of the European War: Review of Germany's Internal and External Situation</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 2) Minimum clothing and housing</p>
<p>Following this, the food ration coupons, since August 23. The 53rd coupon has been used. To this point, the ration allocation has changed as follows. The main food, meat, the first distribution was 500 grams per person per week, since March of this year. Reduced to 250 grams, only half of what it was at the beginning of the war. According to Goering's statement at the beginning of the war, bread was not to be restricted, but by October 1939, the regulation was 2,500 grams per week, and since 1941, it has been 2,000 grams per week. Since March of this year, to compensate for the reduction in meat, an additional 250 grams were added. Half oil has increased by 125 grams compared to the beginning of the war, for a total of 500 grams, and has remained unchanged to this day.</p>
<p>Margarine has been reduced to half of what it was at the beginning, and lard cannot be obtained now, so the overall amount of fats and oils has inevitably decreased slightly. However, cheese has increased by 125 grams since March, about twice what it was in 1939, and the fat nutrition of the people has been maintained. Potatoes, which Germans regard as rice, have adopted a pre-order system until the third year of the war. Since 1942, a coupon system has also been adopted, with about 3,500 grams allocated per week. A large amount is actually used for manufacturing sweets, and has been greatly reduced. From January to August of this year, adults were rationed 10 pounds and children 20 pounds. In 1939, sugar was rationed at 1,000 grams every three weeks, and is now 900 grams.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding clothing, in the first two months of the war, for major clothing items, a purchase permit was required, becoming a fractional system. Recently, due to the intensification of aerial warfare, the use of clothing coupons by adults has been suspended, and purchase permits are only issued to those who have suffered in air raids. Clothing manufacturers have also been ordered to specialize in the needs of these victims.</p>
<p>Third, the changes in housing have been dramatically revealed due to the bombing of major cities as this year enters the decisive period. Since the housing control in the spring of this year, emergency measures such as the "New Regulations on the Supply of Housing to Victims" have been re-implemented since the beginning of June. New relatives and friends living together, people in the city borrowing houses in the countryside, and the construction of houses on roofs and underground are all increasing. Searching for air raid shelters has become a new lesson. In terms of entertainment, it was resolutely liquidated due to the long-term and intensified war, with the Battle of Stalingrad as the . Rental cars in transportation agencies, except for patients, are restricted from passengers under the strict control of the police. All unnecessary things are sacrificed to complete the war. In terms of domestic affairs, after the new Minister of Internal Affairs Himmler took office and took control of public security, the lives of the people became more and more pressing.</p>
<p>The transition of economic life</p>
<p>Anglo-American bombing cannot decisively destroy Sheng Longli, but with the prolongation of the war against the Soviet Union, the increasingly serious wartime economy has given rise to a new term, the air raid economy, which expresses the current economic life. Leaving aside military production for the time being, the state of lack of general consumer goods due to air raids cannot be denied. To this end, various Liu are implemented under the strong organizational force to maintain order on the ground. On the one hand, due to the huge absorption of civilian needs since the beginning of the war, and on the other hand, due to the increase in national income, especially due to the mobilization of latent population after the Battle of Stalingrad, the national income has greatly increased. Extending working hours is also one of the reasons, and the danger of inflation is only the recent increase in short-term debt. The original price and wage restrictions have not been shaken at all. The prices of rent, coal, and food, the three major factors in the lives of the Xu people, are guaranteed to be at a minimum level of stability.</p>
<p>A kind of abnormal phenomenon under air raids, barter seems to be decreasing. The value of things is considered priceless due to bombing, and most people increase their cash on hand in preparation for temporary evacuation. The basic nature of the wartime economy has been heading in the same direction since 1939. As a result of its development, all economic activities have been strengthened and unified under control in order to carry out the war. Among the three major items of temporary, quantitative productivity, smooth allocation of labor and raw materials, how the increase or decrease of productivity becomes the current issue.</p>
<p>Heated German Spirit</p>
<p>After the great victory on the Western Front, until the period when the Balkans were swept away, that is, during the period when Britain was gradually being eliminated, the initial "victor's" war of the German masses was formed against the background of the blitzkrieg's greatness and the new emerging emotions of the European New Order. However , after the war against the Soviet Union, this view of war changed greatly. The Battle of Stalingrad became more and more profound, and the previous bombing of Hamburg fundamentally revised the war view of the German masses. The current view of war is the concept of reducing war. The aerial that the United States and Britain are currently applying, the term "terror" cannot be cut to express it, but it is a devastating air raid that turns everything on the ground into nothing.</p>
<p>Therefore, the war view of all the German people is also the first thing in the history of human warfare. The definition that "battle is a political extension" has long been abandoned, and every people now cannot but realize that they can live or die at any time. Therefore, the hatred of the United States and Britain that every people now holds is no different from the soldiers who used guns to stab the enemy in the past. The maintenance of personal life has now been completely abandoned. Not to mention the situation in World War I when even dogs were used as food and fought to the end, the spirit of tasting hardships is completely reappearing in Germany today.

<h3>From Price Limits on Western Medicine to Rationing</h3>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>Since the Incident, the market price of Western medicine has risen due to the interruption of supply routes and speculation and hoarding. Fortunately, patients in need at that time could still purchase it at any time. Later, the authorities stipulated price limits for various raw materials and finished products to prevent manipulation. The benevolent government of the authorities took the lives of 5 million citizens of Shanghai as a prerequisite and limited the prices. However, the result was the opposite. The citizens not only did not benefit from it, but were even more burdened. One day, they contracted a disease and consulted a doctor. The prescription prescribed was run throughout the city, and they could not purchase it and died. The number was not small.</p>
<p>I work in a certain pharmacy and know a thing or two about this industry. My humble opinion is as follows: When price limits were first imposed on Western medicine, the price was less than the cost. Manufacturers could not bear the cost and stopped production. Retailers could not bear to be reported by the authorities for exceeding the price limit and being punished. The above two points have caused the past patients to have no way to purchase. However, the goods were hit by the suspension of production, resulting in a shortage of goods on the market, and were then hoarded, and the price rose like a kite. However, the manufacturers' suspension of production is not a long-term plan, and seeing the high price of goods, they were even more eager. Therefore, they supported the economy and raised the price limit. The raised price limit was more expensive than the black market. The hoarders dumped the goods, and at the same time, although the manufacturers were willing to rush to produce, their price was affected by the decline in the black market price, and they had no way out. However, they have a comprehensive plan to hoard the manufactured goods and not sell them until the black market price rises before selling them. The suffering of patients is especially evident here. In the future, when the control and rationing are implemented, please pay attention to the following three points: Western medicine cannot be like cigarettes and cotton cloth. Citizens can purchase it in advance. Once they contract a disease, whether it is the right period for rationing, there are more than 10,000 types of Western medicine, and whether the medicine being rationed is just what the patient needs. (Guoqiang)</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>In recent years, Western medicine has been regarded by speculators as one of the biggest targets for hoarding, and each pharmacy has earned tens of millions or even hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>Medicines are important items related to people's lives. After Western medicines are hoarded by hoarders, the value of medicines has increased unprecedentedly, causing countless poor patients to lose their lives in vain because they cannot afford it. In order to eliminate this dark and unreasonable phenomenon, I put forward the following opinions: I hope that the joint efforts and common supervision can eliminate this dark and bad phenomenon:</p>
<p>The government should urge the establishment of a medicine rationing office.</p>
<p>Each pharmacy must accept the entrustment of the rationing office to sell rationed medicines and report the actual sales quantity to the rationing office on schedule.</p>
<p>Rationed medicines must be planned and distributed by the government. The production and existing quantity of each pharmaceutical factory and pharmacy must be registered with the government. When necessary, the government must purchase them at any time.</p>
<p>Rationed products must be sold at a limited price assessed by the government.</p>
<p>Each doctor who has opened a business and obtained a license in this port should apply for registration with the rationing office. All prescriptions prescribed by registered doctors may be purchased from the rationing office.</p>
<p>When a patient purchases medicine with a prescription from a rationing pharmacy, the rationing pharmacy must verify whether the doctor is registered and record the citizen certificate number and address of the patient or the patient's family for random inspection at any time.</p>
<p>If a registered doctor is found to have prescribed a fake prescription or committed fraud, their registration certificate will be revoked. (Xiu Ru)</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>I recently read a letter in your newspaper from Mr. Liaofan, exposing that my manuscript "Man and National Language" was copied from an article by Fu Wang published in "A Youth" in 1940. After checking, "Fu Wang" is my pen name. After I submitted "A Youth and National Language" to the publication, it was not published for a long time, so I submitted the manuscript to your newspaper. Now I read a letter from Mr. Liaofan and learned that "A Youth" has been published, which I regret very much. Yao Shaosheng Qi.</p>
