<h3 id="c1">接收租界與管理敵產 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>國府行政院本月九日會議，通過在行政院直隸之下，設置接收租界委員會，撤廢治外法權委員會及敵產管理委員會，而日本大東亞相靑木大臣亦於本月十日在議院答覆關於劉華問題方針的質問中，也明白宣布：（一）關於撤廢在華治外法權，由兩國專門委員會協議決定，實行方法：第一先由關於課稅權之治外法權做起。實行時期，尙不能確言，專門委員會將徴求民間意見。（二）關於移交在華敵產，自完成大東亞戰爭的見地觀之，亦有由國府處理，較爲適於我方處鄧者，自宜移父國　管理。從上列消息來看，可見一月九日的中日協定已臨到開始實踐的階段了。當筠劃時代的事件將要展開之時，兩國人民都在注視着和期待着，特別是中國人民更有熱烈的希望。因此，我們對於雙方當局，尤其是負責執行這一重大事件的兩國專門委員會諸君，敬以熱　，奉獻一言。</p>
<p>關於交還租界及撤廢治外法權這一歷史性的事件，最主要的　義，是日本實際上表現的眞意。同時，它也是未來中日兩民族合作建設東亞新秩序的開始。因此，在這歷史事件的執行中，除了雙方政府特派人員所成立的專門委員會之外，似平還應該廣徴雙方國民的意見。並在執行之前，儘速羅致專門人材，成立民間的諮詢機關，或民間的各種專門委員會，供獻各種具體的意見與辦法，以備雙卞當局的參考。</p>
<p>至於移交敵產，日方亦特別重視此事。我們相信負責當局一定會妥善處理的。這裏所要進言的：第一，此事和撤廢在華治外法權和交還和界，有同樣重要的而且含有國際性的意義，爲舉世所注目。特別是在英美敵人方面，不斷的對於日軍管理下英美在華產業移交國府管理，極盡其誣衊之能事。所以，我國在接收和管理中，　特別表現我國道義的傳統，卓越的人格，粉碎敵方一切誣衊的陰謀，而增强我國在國際上之地位。第二，接管敵產要適應戰時需要，對於生產性的敵產，特別注意其有計劃的增加生產，以供應戰時軍需和國民日常生活的需要，應擴充的加以擴充。凡是適合於國人管理的，應愼選專門家來管理；特別適合於日方管理的，就聘請日方專家繼續管理；或特別適合於中日合作的，即以合作方式加以管理。第三，戰時敵產的處理，自有國際公法可循，無庸贅述。不過，我們特別要指出的，是日方一年來對於敵產的管理，在原有人事方面，只要沒有敵對的行動，絕不輕於更調，仍使照常供職，予以生活上保障。在物資及產業方面更絕對遵守國際公法。例如對不動產房屋及其內部設備，調查登記後，即嚴禁任何人擅自移動，這種美德，就連敵方也不得不迭决加以讚揚。我們更應該表示大國民風度，對於接收管理的敵產，完全繼承日方一年來這種美德。尤其是執行的人員，更須淸高廉潔，以爲國家增光，不要辜負友邦對我們的信任心。</p>
<p>最後，我們不厭重複的申述：這次中日協定的實踐，是中日兩國誠意合作的開始。我們每個執行實踐協定工作的人，都將是這光榮的歷史中的人物，我們爲着國家的光榮，敬祝委員諸君的成功。</p>

<h3 id="c42">宣戰第一週月的華北 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派員心印</p>
<p>春節甫過，首先便遇到國府對英美宣戰第一個紀念日。宣戰，使事變五年來的華北，發生了劃期的轉變。自從一月九日以來，一切的一切，連空氣都感覺得異樣起來！</p>
<p>華北，一向是被命名為「防共第一綫」，「大東亞戰爭後方基地」，而被自為「特殊化」地區的。可是，自大東亞戰爭邁進決戰第二年，國府對英美宣戰以來，華北的特殊使命，已由全中國平均負擔起來，所以華北「特殊的性格」，已然不存在了。脫退了特殊色彩，披上戰時的外衣的華北，一個月來，在一般心理上，在各方事實表現上，有不少新的顯示：</p>
<p>第一：政治機構上的表現</p>
<p>戰時政治機構簡易化，是日本最近所勵行的，宣戰後的華北，也入於戰時體制中，政治機構自然也需要調整。另一方面，華北政務委員會，整個的政治機構，在新中國參加大東亞戰爭的新時代的今日，將要如何進化，亦為一般所期待。</p>
<p>身兼十八要職的華北政委常委，建設總署督辦，兼新民會副會長殷同之逝世，給予華北政委會以極大的波動。因　殷氏的出缺，和政委會整個機構的要求，發生了最近人事大異動。這個異動。分三段落而出現：一月二十日發表，北調平市長余晋龢繼任建設總署督辦。一月二十八日發表：調山西省長蘇體仁，繼任北平市長，以山西新民報社長馮司直為山西省長。二月九日發表：華北政委會委員長兼內務總署督辦士揖唐，敎育總署督辦周作入辭職，由朱深繼任委員長，齊爕元兼任內務總署督辦，並調剛剛就職北平市長八天的蘇體仁，改任敎育總署督辦。更起用前天津市警察局長劉玉書為北平市長。接着便是大批的隨着長官而云，跟着長官而來的中下級官吏的任免調動。與新舊委員長交替之同時，政委會的全體委員名單，（包括留任新任）經國府重行明令決定，並且，政委會所屬各總署的組織條例，亦經明令公佈。醖釀着强化機構簡化人事的政委會，因此得到一時的安定。</p>
<p>可是，戰時下的華北人心，是緊張而充滿着希望的，政委會雖是人事一新，而澈底更新面目的空氣，仍舊瀰漫在社會各階層。一般相信，新中國新中央統一强化戰時政治機構的時機，不久即將到來。</p>
<p>第二：國旗不再代以五色旗</p>
<p>隨着國府取消國旗加標幟的明令，華北政委會也通令於本月九日起，禁以五色旗混代國旗。按：華北自國府還都以來，始復見國旗，但得以懸用者祇有機關學校，商民仍一致應用五色旗，國府對英美宣戰第一個紀念日的本月九日，北平全市商民，一齊自動懸出不附標幟的國旗來。華北國旗重光，實在給予人心一大興奮。</p>
<p>第三，新民會的新動向</p>
<p>新民會也是事變後華北的特殊機構之一，可是，時至今日，他的性格已有今昔之殊。在去年十月末，第三屆新民會全聯會舉行時，得到汪主席光榮的蒞臨，兩次對大會演講，全會人心大為感奮，不期然地一致燃起擁護主席的熱忱。就在那次大會中，決定了變更新民會綱領的大事件。新民會開始在精神上受汪主席的領導。國府宣戰，新民會在一月二十日舉行「參戰全聯」，一致通過推戴汪主席為該會名譽會長。當日得到主席覆電·允予接受·全體會眾·歡喜欲狂。自此，新民會更是名實均受主席的領導了！</p>
<p>新民會如今所謂「會運動」（會的工作）的中心，是集中在新國民運動，同時，精神上與東亞聯盟乃為一體。他的新的演進，正與委會同樣地受一般的期待。</p>
<p>第四，金融，物價的反映</p>
<p>華北是聯銀區，聯銀對儲備的公定匯率是十比三，實際上在去年十一月末，匯率的黑市還是十比二·一二，宣戰以後，才上漲為十比二·七，現在繼長增高，大有打破公定匯率的趨勢。金融界一致相信，儲備幣對聯銀，不久即將成為二對一的行市。足見華北人心對中央的趨向。</p>
<p>不過，戰時下一般心理，向來趨重於物資的持有。因此，造成物價的上漲，所以本年一月份以來，各種物價一致上昇。尤以食糧為最。例如：大米每擔，在一月上旬售價三百元，二月初已昇到四百四十元，麵粉每袋，一月初旬是五十元，最近已昇到七十五元。小米，玉麵（平民主要食糧）一月初旬每市稱一斤，不過七角，二月初旬已昇到一元七八角。春節後，開市第一聲，兩件駭人聽聞的漲價，即是小米玉米每百斤漲價三十六元，足金每兩暴漲四百七十元，（由每四百五十元漲為每兩九百二十元），實為近近罕見的狂漲。</p>
<p>北平市中日當局，亦曾努力設法挽救糧荒，不過北平的糧荒，不僅是因為奸商囤積，更是因了來源梗阻。所以正在多方籌策中。當局本已籌妥配給辦法，（即計口授糧）因平市食糧，存底太薄，來源又不繼，所以停頓下來。如果糧價再續行狂漲，全市食糧配給是非舉辦不可了。此外，不但食糧恐慌，即素稱存貨豐富的食油，醬油，白糖，亦齊感缺乏，一般深感，平市在不久的將來，勢將如上海市民一樣，要飽營軋米，軋油，軋糖的風味了</p>
<p>第五，敎育界的增產運動</p>
<p>華北，尤其是北平的敎育界，近兩三年來，全體都在忙於治安强化龍龍，宣戰以來，則集中目標於「增產敎育」。敎育總署最近通令華北各級學校，一律增設農業課目，開辦農事訓練所及農塲，各級學生，須一律參加農業勞作。這是敎署的總動員華北百萬學生從事農業增產的計劃。</p>
<p>宣戰第一週月的華北，略如上述。且看第二個月如何！</p>

<p>— 朱超然</p>
<p>上海南市一帶自經「八—三」事變之後，滿目荒涼，十室九空，目下雖已逐漸恢復繁榮，但祗限於老西門，九畝地一帶，其他地段依然如鄉村中之小市鎮狀態。</p>
<p>欲考其所以致此之原因，任何南市居民均知之，即為華法交界區域（民國路）所築鐵門不普遍開放之故，因之民國路上迄今店門封鎖，行人絕少，其蕭條情形，為上海市內所罕見。</p>
<p>惟近十六舖之東門路，老北門口，新橋街口，南陽橋之老西門，及斜橋，徐家匯等處，因此處之交界鐵門均已開放，故終日熱鬧，商市繁榮，一如租界。</p>
<p>竊思法租界當局之封閉交界處鐵門，事變以來迄今將屆六年，民眾之千呼萬求，要求普遍開放，至今猶未核准，近且本變加厲，自老北門口至新北門口之民國路沿法界一段，滿堆污穢泥土，高達七八尺，綿延蜿長，竟如土山，用意何在，令人莫測。</p>
<p>當局之所以築此界限者，在「八一三」當時因戰事關係，為求租界安全嗣後戰爭西移，則因租界與華界地位截然不同，此時不願開放，尚有理由；但自大東亞戰發生，及今日國府已正式參戰以來，其租界與華界早已打成一片，法租界雖為例外，但精神上亦早已默契，故殊不應再有此不合理之封鎖政策，以阻止南市之繁榮，亦即妨碍整個上海市區之復興，南市三十萬居民希望得一明白之解釋。</p>
<h3 id="c59">改良麥根路交通 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 于文</p>
<p>去年九月，工部局委托外商洋行（比商？修築麥根路溝渠原定三星期竣工，惟至今業已四月餘，猶未完工，工程浩大，固為事實，惟工人並不極力趕工，亦為無庸諱言。</p>
<p>麥根路為交通要道，為自租界中區至西北區，必經之要道，有十六·十九·廿一·三路電申通駛其間，而該三路電車乘者異常擁擠，大半為工人，自交通阻斷後，電車至三板廠新橋戛然而止，須行崎嶇不平之路半里餘，始能在麥根路北段再候車北行，異常不便在雨天尤為難行因未筑完成之馬路泥濘不堪，行人裏足。在夜間常有跌交頭破血流之事發生，且不但有中途步行換車之麻煩，車價方面乘者亦須多出車。一旦週有任何不幸事件發生，警備車又不能開入，救火車資更邊論，矣則對於治安，有莫大之願　。為了這個原因，工部局方面更應極力敦促工人依限完工，不得故意拖延。</p>
<p>在麥根路沿河一帶，又有許多垃圾，堆積如山，連綿數十丈蔚為奇觀。奇臭撲鼻，東京路一帶亦有相類情形。現在春冬之交雖不致引起疫　，但究竟有礙衛生，且愈堆愈高，出清愈難，又有倒下阻礙交通之處，未知承包搬運垃圾者何故不用船載至鄉間充作肥料而倒在麥根路上，甚望當局澈查此事。以重衛生。</p>

<p>前年十二月間、本局鑒於汽油存底有限、當即嚴格限制摩托車輛之行駛、以省汽油、摩托車輸之駛用、以運載少數市民及裝運主要物品爲限、因此在同年十二月九日、禁止以摩托貨車裝運貨物、　領有統制物價委員會之移運許可證者不在此例、同時通飭摩托貨車車主、將其車輛及所獲汽油供給向本的報請登記、同月十三日、實行簽發糧食運輸許可證、規定摩托貨車祗准裝運食米麵粉及其他糧食、至於摩托車輛、概須貼有三角照會、方准行駛、否則禁止使用、</p>
<p>同年十二月十八日、本局會規定裝運米麵之最高運費、即米每包二元、麵粉每袋五角、同月二十二日、復經布吿組織一卡車聯合營業處、按照規定運費、車運主要物品、嗣因鑒於手車已能替代卡車、故該卡車聯合營業處可無需要、</p>
<p>同年十二月三十一日、本局發出布吿、通飭執有三角照會之汽車車主、不得使用車輛以供娛樂或私人便利之用、上年一月五日、復經通吿各車主、倘無三角照會而擅自行駛車輛、一經查獲、當將其車輛沒收、</p>
<p>上年十月八日、本局刊發布告、準許燃燒汽油代用品之出租汽車在界內行駛、供備緊要用途、關於此項汽車執照數額、經三市區市政當局會同商定、本局限發二百張、法租界公董局與市政府各限發一百張、</p>

<p>二十六日大陸　報載稱：全國經濟委員會顧問兼中央儲備銀行顧問文木村增太郞博士，前　出席全國經濟委員會首次全體會議赴京，頃已公畢返滬，十五日下午三時，在外灘儲　銀行，會見記者，　稱全國經濟委員會首次全體會議，華北華中之出席委員，熱心加强，參戰之國府，以謀　立戰時經濟體制，增强生產，此種誠摯態度，殊堪敬佩，會議結果，頗多成就。以下爲記者與木村氏之問答：</p>
<p>問：關於促進物資供應之提案如何？</p>
<p>答：關於收買米，棉，雜糧等項，民間方面提出　見頗多，但目下狀態之中，收買　量物資一事，相常困難，是以有人主張不　期待產業之復興與生產之增强，其唯一辦法，即爲將物資山上海流入內地，　事如　運營得當，相信其成績必良在此種塲合，其收買與配給兩種機構，必須作系統之結合。</p>
<p>問：關於促進收買及物資增產之各項對策如何？</p>
<p>答：增進農產物，爲最必要之急務。關於此項問題，有種種議論提出，其第一項條件，即爲改進農村經濟力，吾則縱有調整收買機構之準備，而農民無購買農具肥料之資金，亦屬徒然，是以注意此點，在進行灌漑事業時，同時考慮農村放款，聞華興銀行已　舉仃如合作社規模小額貸款，成績異常優良，中央備備銀行，以銀行領袖地位，亦擬動員中國，交通，等各銀行，積極繁榮農村金融，但目下內地金融機　尙未完全，故中央儲備銀打，與商業銀行，錢莊，銀號，購貨商人，地主，農民組織密　連擊之機構，貸款接濟，則對於收貿貨物必有良好成績，惟此事不克一舉成功，於從已司　範圍先行着手，並擬設立農村金融專門銀行，但尙未具體化，其次，如能着手除去水害，改良灌溉，則可望大量增收。</p>
<p>問：華北提案內容如何？</p>
<p>答：華北並無提案，僅報吿金融，收買，以及其他問題，華北之物價對策，似頗圓滿。</p>
<p>問：曾聞此次會議上有打破地域經濟，與統一國家經濟之議論，　與此有　之金融，滙兌問題如何解決？</p>
<p>答：關於此項問題，並無何種提案，打破地域經濟，先有種種準備之必要，如將經濟單位之小同點互相混合，决難獲得良好結果，第一必須決定通貨之父流點，吾則貿易問題亦難調整。</p>
<p>問：中國聯合準備銀行總裁在時璟氏來滬之目的如何？</p>
<p>答：據在氏所言，不過爲視察上海而來。余之結論，認爲上列各項問題解決後，始能維持中儲券價格，不特能抑平物價，且可增强生產。關於安定通貨，抑平物價，增强生產各問題，約至三，四月間可準備竣事，今後全國經濟委員會之性質愈益重大，國府與上海財界，正協力以解決各項問題。</p>
<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3 id="c78">今後之中國經濟界 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>已往上海金融七每有大變動，不由影響及於全中國，世界市塲，無不隨之發生變化，上海經濟勢力之雄厚可知。蓋數十年來，上海之經濟活動，已與世界通呼吸，動輒與歐美日本市塲相頡頄矣。自太小洋戰事發生，上海之經濟界，頓然易位而改觀，一切力量，遂脫離舊範疇，而別關新蹊徑。毀舊機構以成新機構，驅舊通貨以行新通貨，滅舊中心以造　中心，斷舊滙兌以立新滙兌，於是三十一年以後上海之經濟界，絕不但三十一年以前之上海經濟界，而三十一年度之上海經濟界，遂成爲中國經濟史上特殊之一頁。</p>
<p>今日之上海經濟情勢，外滙由英鎊美金而軍票，通貨由舊法幣而中儲券，股市由洋股而華股，銀錢各業，亦率多變列其內容。大率已往數十年演妙之歷史，今則縮短在一年內一一改觀，極波譎雲詭之能事。尤其是新興之事業，多似雨後之春筍，令人目眩而心悸，時形之發展，與偏面之繁榮，輒令人有莫由可吾之表示。今後上海之經濟界，爲禍爲福，爲凶爲吉，爲盛爲衰，將在此一年中卜之。據記者之見解，福也，吉也，盛也，皆由我上海之金融界企業家自造之。而涵煦保育發榮滋長之責，厥在政府。</p>
<p>今者戰時經濟政策綱領，已由國府就全國經濟委員會制定方案公布。我金融家與企業家應一致協力於產業之增進，以實現全國有計畫的生產。不但同業與同業間，應密切合作，即同業與非同業間，更當互相扶掖，而同業公會之健全，與生產機關合理化之推行，更迫切需要。凡已往彼此間之脫節，　組織上之缺陷，致影響於生產之效能者，均應一一避免。尤其不　有各自爲政相互嫉妒傾軋之風氣。人人應排除私利，放遠眼光，切實認識當前應負的經濟上重要使命，在全國上下同一目標之下，各各貢獻其所有之心思力量，爲千鈞一髮之中國經濟界，作繼往開來之工作，中國之經濟，或有剝極而復之希望乎？</p>
<h3 id="c79">復興中的國府經濟（中） <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>二·打破內地閉關自守式的經濟現隊</p>
<p>現　成爲華中經濟內最重要的問　者，首先就是　價問盬與幣制統一問題（即全面使　儲備劵問題）。的確，澈底平抑物價，加强統一幣制，　復興華中經濟最重要的因素。然而，現在華中經濟囊根本問　、也可以說是　　解決　　三國貿易斷　，　產　　以　內地物　周轉不　所　之資物不足。安定　價　　固通貨等問題，也與此息息相關。　歸根結底，本不　則無以治標。所以本文決定專討論現在華中如何解決這一問題。</p>
<p>目前華中工業，特別是其中佔　大比重的上海工業，主要由於大東亞戰爭爆發，而國外原料來源斷絕與內地物資輸入减少，以致生產量大爲降低。爲求克服這一困難，當國外早料絕望的今天，其先決條件，只有打破內地經濟底閉關自守現象，使內地棉花與小麥等原料，源源不絕地運至上海及其他工業中心地帶。</p>
<p>一般說來，內地經濟底閉　自守，從反面說，上海「孤島化」底主要原因，大體如下</p>
<p>一、因作戰必要上所生之對敵經濟封鎖。</p>
<p>二、因工業品與農產物相互價格底天壤懸殊，而發生物資交流比例底急劇降低：換言之，由於都市工業品價格底飛漲，以致農村購買力縮减，故而農產物底提供停滯。</p>
<p>三、內地土產物資收買機構底不完備。</p>
<p>第一個關於對敵經濟封鎖，則上海和香港早已被日軍佔領的今天，巴失去其必要，所以巳在逐漸取消中。然而，使今天成爲最大原因的第二種兩者問底　殊價格縮小，這却成爲非常困難的事。去年七月，國府頒佈平抑物價暫行條例與取締非法提高物價條例，繼而進行所調實施辦法底主要商品　別品目　，取締銀錢業商品抵押放款規定等等，如此對平　物價絞腦榨汁，煞費苦心。此　救濟方案，在一般上，成爲物價飛漲底　常有效的制栽　，也是事實。但，降低目前登峰造極的工業品價格，當然決不是易如反掌的事，同時，在另一方面如提　農產物價格，也是非所　望的上策。旣如此，想解決問題，也許只好期待於目前第三種完備的收買機構，藉此再慢慢走上克服第二種兩者間底懸殊價格之方向。</p>
<p>原來，米，小麥，棉花等土產物資底收買機構，是由作戰部隊當地籌糧而產生，繼而發展成爲對日物資供給底收買機構。這種收買機構，乃只是維持軍隊當地生活用的機構，道顯然具有經濟外的性質，同時也是理所當然的現象。繼而國府成立，收買機構移交給人民，所以這一機構當然發生了變化。然而這類機構，按南京特電（一月四日朝日新聞），據說其主旨有下列缺陷：</p>
<p>一、在過渡機構方面看，已發展成爲以日本商人爲中心而迅速搜集電隊維持物資的御用商人底壟斷機構。</p>
<p>二、且爲對抗重慶底經濟封鎖與敵性商社，而設立的日本商社，有輕視中國方面向來的商業機構傾向，結果釀成收買效率底降低。</p>
<p>三、壟斷機構被運用成爲自由主義性格底機關，其活動基礎成爲營利的，排他的，而竟濫用當局賦與的特權，努力追求利潤。</p>
<p>四、從而，上述收買機構底收買價格，非常的低，以致造成最近收買成績底不良，因爲農民願用高價賣給當地工塲，同時也正逐漸傾向於棉布，香烟，蠟燭等底自家手工業生產。</p>
<p>五、此外，由於分配機構底不完備，以致對收買土產物資底農村，在分配不可或缺的日常必需品以及生產工具上，也有相當缺陷，同收買機構缺少有機的速繫。</p>
<p>如果眞是如此，須先（甲）抑制日本人商社壟斷機構底不當利潤，使收買價格合理化。（乙）取消排他的宗派性，要與中國商業機構作最大限度的合作。如把當前二者做到，也可以預知內地物資能提供相常多的數量。藉此，上海工業底生產力也會增加。如此則可能供給內地農村以低價的必需品，藉此又可以換出內地底物資。這在理論上是如此，當然在實踐上，不能如此簡單可以收效。總之，想打破內地閉關自守現象以提高華中生產力，則必須採取改造國人壟斷機構底性格與加强合辦事業底緊急設施。（熔：譯自一月二十七日東京經濟學者）</p>

<h3 id="c81">上海錢荘的剖解 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>最近上海錢莊的設立，如雨後春笋般樣增加，牠的資本，有多至百萬的，也祇有數萬資本的，因其資本之大小，其經營業務的範圍，亦遂有廣狹，名稱方面，亦有幾種不同的稱呼；惟總括言之，約可分為五種，今述之於後：</p>
<p>（一）匯劃莊——匯劃莊爲加入錢業公會之錢莊，故又稱「入園」錢莊：其資本在錢莊中最大，實力雄厚，其可有直接參加匯劃票據之權，普通所謂錢莊，類指此而言。</p>
<p>（二）元字莊——元字莊爲次於匯劃莊之錢莊，其資本及業務範國，均較匯劃莊爲小；在昔紙錢時代，銀錢收解，均遺棧司挑担運送，故有挑打錢莊之稱，因其不能參加錢業公會匯劃票據，故對於票據收解，都托匯劃莊代理匯劃。</p>
<p>（三）亨字莊——亨字莊的資本及業務範圍，又較元字莊爲差，每於營業之後，其應收解銀錢，挑担運送事項，即於日間辦畢，故晚上無事休息，人遂稱之曰閉門挑打莊矣。</p>
<p>（四）利字莊——利字莊的業務與前述三種錢莊不同，旣不經營存押放款，又不經營銀行附屬業務，其成交者，惟外幣等之交換與輔幣之折兌而已；近來因日軍票等外幣價格有定，故此類錢莊已自行關閉而减少。</p>
<p>（五）貞字莊——貞字莊有「烟紙錢莊」，「零兌錢莊」等諸稱；其主要業務爲零兌輔幣：並附營紙烟雜貨買賣，此類錢莊，街頭林立，吾人到處可見也。</p>
<p>由上所述，可見匯割莊爲錢莊之主體，元亨錢莊輔之，而其業務大致與銀行相符，蓋其經營者，爲：（Ａ）各種存款（B）各種放款（Ｃ）押款（Ｄ）期票貼現（Ｅ）倉庫業（Ｆ）匯兌等項也。</p>
<p>其業務旣與銀行相類同，那末爲何不直接改稱銀行呢？這個問題的答案，的言之，可分下列數點。</p>
<p>（一）歷史悠久；在未有銀行之前，向執各大商埠經濟之牛耳，因共信用卓著，故無須改稱。</p>
<p>（二）最近錢莊業雖奉部令一律改組爲股份有限公司，然在往昔，我國錢莊，以合夥組織居多，故合夥人間負有連帶無限責任，此爲其信用卓著之因，而無須改稱銀行原因之二。</p>
<p>（三）我國工商界素嗜保守，而我國各地佔有大多數之舊式或半新式之工商企業，故咸樂與錢莊往來，况匯劃莊之「入園」資格與手續厘訂頗嚴，故財力信譽，均極雄厚：旣可得工商界之擁護，又可避免失去「入園」之雄姿，一舉兩得，何須改哉。</p>
<p>（四）錢莊所出之莊票，其掛失與手續厘訂頗嚴，且以往莊票之偽簽甚少，故其收受人可免受原來向錢莊請求出票人之欺騙，即若出票莊不幸倒閉，對於莊票之執有人，亦必優先付訖，故錢莊之營業繁忙，有賴於莊票實大，莊票既不易改稱，錢莊自無須改稱爲銀行也。</p>
<p>總上所述，可見錢莊於今金融界中，已佔有不可移的優位：然近來新創錢莊頗多，希其本錢莊以往之宗旨，爲社會調劑　融，勉力服務，則其以往之維姿，旣不會稍减，而對於社會，亦尙有莫大之貢獻。（誠忠）</p>

<p>— 樹揚</p>
<p>要想收穫，就得播種，旣播了種，就有收穫，這種淺顯易見的因果關係，是誰都明瞭的。</p>
<p>「要想收穫，就得播種。」這可說是一個牢不可破的定律，誰也吾認不了「春耕「夏耘」，才會有「秋收」，「冬藏一。說是憑空的從土縫裏攢出黃金色又肥又大的穀粒，臥在田埂上看着大麥黃小麥熟，那眞是荒天下之大唐！</p>
<p>「旣播了種，就有收穫」。這不能强拗的說是一無例外，因爲種子下了土，就要看溫度，水分，養料的適宜與吾，才能生長起來，播了種而沒有收穫，有時是會遇到的，不過就普遍的情形看來，撒佈一百顆種子，至少該有十顆萌發，總不致於全功盡棄吧？</p>
<p>播種與收穫的關係，雖然很淺顯，但是還被許多人作錯誤的估計和糢糊的認識，爲什麼呢？我看是因爲從播種到收穫還有一段必經的路程，這許多人就在這一段路程上成了迷途的羔羊，這一段是什麽路程呢？—就是耕耘。</p>
<p>有人說「只問耕耘」，這未免太盲從了，汗流浹背的栽培着靑草，人家說他「吃力不討好」，他也許還自揚他「只問一的精神哩。還有人「揠苗助長」，自以爲是取道捷徑，他可不曾料到揠後的苗不久就要枯槁了。</p>
<p>所以我認爲播種前要選種，收穫前要支配，而聯絡播種與收穫的是一段堅毅忍耐的正確耕耘工夫。</p>
<h3 id="c93">生活的紀律化 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 心一</p>
<p>生活要有紀律，因爲有紀律的生活能使你的精神永遠小萎靡，而做事也能免除「朝三暮四」的惡習，所以間接直接中還能提髙工作的效果。因爲工作效能的增高，你的精神一定感到快樂，所以對自己也能有更進一層的「自信」。而且它還能訓練你支配事物的能力，正當的發洩你賸餘的精力，使生活得刋健全的發展。</p>
<p>有紀律的生活是嚴肅的，富於創造性和進取性的，「靑年」是一個進取的時期，同時也是個創造的時期，所以有紀律的生活，對年靑的一　，有更急切的需要。</p>
<p>生活的紀律化，粗看起來是不「自然」的，是「刻板」的。但你應該用「恒」字去培植它，因爲雖然在起先，你感到很多的不便，和痛苦，但你習慣後，你一定能發覺，它是有生氣的，是自由的。</p>

<p>— 劉飛瓊</p>
<p>我的生活</p>
<p>陳跡：</p>
<p>過去的生活，像一幕喜劇似地在台上演畢了。記得我從幼小以至少年時代，家境就很豐裕，自己又肯用功讀書，所以我覺得很驕傲，很自大，因爲有許多人，他們雖有用功的，但家境並不富裕，而家境富裕的，又不願意用功，但是我二者俱全：我又有適宜的環境，也有上進的志向：當每逢校中大考之後，我的成績總是名列前茅，從未落後在八十五分以下的，那時候非　家長稱贊我，就是諸親好友也誰人不知。至於日常生活呢，在上海北四川路，我們住的是髙大洋房，又有包車，機器脚踏車，電爐，電風扇，無綫電，在蘇州有自造三間相連的樓房，朱漆大門，寬敞客廳，四周更擺設着大理石的紅木傢具，兩旁通入書房，內中有無論中西古今著名的字畫與書籍，眞是琳琅滿目，不下數萬部。沿書房東牆邊，就是一個桃李繽紛的花園，其中有亭，台，樓，閣，魚池，花畦，水松，假山，確然美不勝收。至於食物方面，不但魚肉天天滿桌，而鷄鴨也是不斷的。自從戰事爆發，家中均往鄉下逃，不幸在鄉下，祖母，舅父，叔父等，均因水土不服，感受驚嚇，而相繼逝世；同時家中一切，不是毀於戰區，就即爲賊所偷，我們在萬分困難之中，輾轉來到上海，除了父親是我們生活的最大支柱以外，其餘就是十個乳毛未乾的一羣小孩了。</p>
<p>現狀：</p>
<p>當我們回到上海來的時候這個家又是父親再獨手空拳所漸漸創立起來的，處此突飛猛進的生活程度之下，我們總算能省食儉用，而維持着求學機會。說到衣食住行方面：雖非萬分艱苦，但也並不充裕，四五年來，我並沒有添製過一件貴車華麗的，或是綾羅綢緞的衣服，隨身或出外所穿的，不但粗布，並且還是自己將舊的，老式的，再修剪一下而已。說到裝飾方面：三四年來，沒有光顧理髮館，頭髮長了，對着鏡子請母親或自己修短一下就算，至於電燙，水燙，火燙，簡直有生以來沒嘗試過，雖然愛美的心理，人人共有，而且我又並非是麻臉或殘缺的人，爲什麽脾氣如此地古怪，總不願隨波逐流呢！當然的，靑年人總是應該隨着時代前進的，但是有一部分潮流所趨之處，並不是有益於我們，或値得模仿的，何况生活在如此時代，我更覺得裝飾是太浪費時間與金錢了，且以父親血汗之錢，作虛榮一擲，事實上也非我們良心上所允許及可能的。其次關於食方面：早上祗有薄薄一片的二兩麵包充飢，沒有山芋，更沒有薄粥，尤其是近兩月來，完全以糙米或碎米，麵粉，作爲　日的中，晚餐，而沒有機會吃到白米飯，我們也常常爲了油缺少，而吃蒸魚，蒸菜，以及炒冷飯，這些我並不覺得痛苦，我只是感到奇怪，從前沒有經歷過的，現在都安然地過去了，雖然，這些實情實景，充塞着我的心房將使永記不亡心，但是我仍舊是儘量的容忍與接受它。共次論到行方面：我每大到校或歸家，無論是大雨，大雪，暴風，我都是以步代車，除非是很緊急的事之外，但也只限於電車。</p>
<p>適應：</p>
<p>古諺有云：『時勢造英雄』但英雄也須改造時勢，我雖沒有如此大的能力和野心，然而至少應有能力以對付環境。處此動蕩不定，風雨飄搖的艱苦世界中，要生存確是非常困難，稍涉不愼，即有被排擠或滾出這世界的危險，所以要有一種生活的技術，加以應付環境。我從三歲的時候，母親即去世，以後就從沒有人吿訴過我，關於世故人情的變化無窮，處世接物的應有態度，在書本上雖也看到一些，然而並不是實際的經驗，僅屬理論的，空虛的文字而已；結果現在一切家務都歸　所管，因爲哥哥們出外自顧前程了，而母親也帶了三個弟妹回鄉，家中祇剩下六個人，除父親早出晚歸外，其餘就是我和表姊，弟，妹，說到他們之間的性情，若差異非常之大，况且我們自幼就互相嘻笑慣的今一且忝主中饋，加以管理，我眞覺到很困難，如果太嚴：必惹怨恨，若太寬非但家務不能料理，反使終日口角打架，簡直煩個不了。所以我一方面料理輛洗滌，及縫剪自己的衣服，房間，和鞋襪，有多餘的時間，即幫同表姊堂弟整理另一部分事務，如果適在假，我即去買小菜，洗米，或煮飯，總之，我要以身作則，使得他們知道諒解；我的管理一切，並不是居於指揮地位，而是負　指導的責任，無論任何事，均須一起工作，使他們知道自己有自尊心，責任心，雖然他們有犯過處，我也給以改錯的機會，暗示他們的錯過，並不是我不知，而是出於寬恕而已。同時對於每日伙食方面，當然能够最好是量入爲出，但是有許多事情的發生，就非人所能預料，因此我一卞面使他們不爲了伙食的成份不良，而影響營養：另一面，也使有限制的吃用，免有不宜之浪費。其次說到我私人，我除掉到校上課，回家料理家務之外，我還需做進修及讀書工作，現在的書籍，是非常之貴，但如果沒有書，又如何能進修呢？所謂「工欲善其事，必先利其器」。尤其是在大學中念書，必須將大部分時間，放在自己進修及博覽羣書之內的，因此我無論在任何情形之下，我都要每星期到兩間大圖書館披閱各種參考書，隨着又選幾本應用的書籍，借回家，趁空餘時間，卽加以筆記下來。再次又談到學費的籌備，當我們每逢大考完畢之後，就常見到父親愁眉不展，因爲處此生活程度髙昂之下　要使一家十二口，勉强度日，全不舉債，已非易事，何况這時期，又需付出一宗鉅額的學費呢！由此我覺得讀書並不是一件快樂的事情，尤其一年又一年的過去，用着父親血汗所付的學費，我更覺得自己的責任重大，內心的快怍愈甚，我何嘗不欲以工作換取一些酬報，但處此人浮於事的世界中，又何處是你的揷足點呢？我此後唯一的補救方法，就是仍舊繼續保持我以前的節儉，留下一切浪費的金錢，以作購書及文具等使用，庶幾可以稍减父親學費上之負担，同時將家務料理得井井有條，不致使父親晚歸後，見到難亂情形，而發生不快之感。</p>
<p>希望：</p>
<p>過去的就讓它過去吧，我知道未來的日子，未必就比現在好，除非它是突然的改變。我的生活，並不希望有一點豪華奢侈的享受或裝飾，我祇希望在困難生活中修養身心，敎育自己，歷史上多少古今中外的偉大人物，還不是在艱苦中生長與成功的嗎？惟其他們能利用舊經騐以　得新經騐，始能創造良好的新環境；所以我需要，亦能够利用痛苦中的經騐，以磨鍊身心，更不讓環境的痛苦，來支配我的身心。（按：劉女士，二十一歲，震旦女子文理學院肄業）。</p>

<p>『你們裏面，有幾個人在戰前就在這裏的，一定總記得那位德國敎師馬克斯（Max）斯坦菲吧。戰事發生時，他正在德國探望他的家。他在這裏的時候是很受歡迎的，朋友也很多。上星期，他在西綫戰死了，認得他的人一定覺得很可惜吧。』</p>
<p>他坐下來以後，他的面色有些慘白，他知道他已作了某種非常的事　。不過他沒有預先和誰商談過這事：誰也不能受到責怪。過了一會，在禮拜堂外面，他聽見了一種辯論：</p>
<p>『吉普斯說，在西綫。這話的意思是不是說他在爲德國人打仗？』</p>
<p>『我想這是對的。』</p>
<p>『那末，將他的名字和其他的人一同讀出來，似乎太有趣了。畢竟他是一個「敵人」呢。』</p>
<p>『喔，我想這不過是吉普斯的思想之一。這老孩子還有許多思想。』</p>
<p>吉普斯回到自己的房間裏，對於這種批評，並不著慣。是的，他還有許多思想——尊嚴而寬宏的思想，牠們在這種發瘋的世界上，在逐漸减少起來了。他又想：勃洛克菲爾德也將從我的地方得到牠們：可是這是不會從別人的地方得到的。</p>
<p>有一次，有人問他對於刺刀操練的意見，該項操練正在相近拍球休息所的地方舉行，他用那種懶懶的，微患喘息的腔調同答着，那種腔調是時常過份地被倣傚着的，他說：『這事在我看來——似乎是——呃哼——很鄙陋的殺人方法』。</p>
<p>這話又傳了開來，受到了歡迎——吉普斯怎樣曾對陸軍部來的戴大銅帽子的軍官說過，刺刀戰是鄙陋的。恰正像吉普斯。他們給他找到了一個形容詞——剛剛開始應用的形容詞：他是先於戰爭的（Pre-War）（三十八）。社會服務</p>

<h3 id="e1">Receiving Concessions and Managing Enemy Assets <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The State Council of the National Government passed a resolution on the 9th of this month's meeting to establish a Committee for Receiving Concessions under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, abolishing the Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritorial Rights and the Committee for the Management of Enemy Assets. Furthermore, Japanese Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry also clearly announced the following in response to questions in the Diet on the 10th of this month regarding the Liu Hua issue: (1) Regarding the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China, specialized committees from both countries will discuss and decide on the implementation methods: firstly, starting with extraterritorial rights related to taxation. The implementation period cannot yet be definitively stated, and the specialized committee will solicit opinions from the public. (2) Regarding the transfer of enemy assets in China, from the perspective of completing the Greater East Asia War, it is more appropriate for the National Government to handle them than for our side to do so, and it is appropriate to transfer them to the National Government for management. From the above news, it can be seen that the Sino-Japanese Agreement of January 9th is about to enter the stage of practical implementation. As this epoch-making event is about to unfold, the people of both countries are watching and anticipating it, especially the Chinese people who have even more fervent hopes. Therefore, we respectfully offer a word of earnest advice to the authorities on both sides, especially to the gentlemen of the specialized committees of both countries who are responsible for executing this significant event.</p>
<p>Regarding the historical event of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, the most important meaning is the sincerity practically demonstrated by Japan. At the same time, it is also the beginning of future cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese peoples in building a new order in East Asia. Therefore, in the execution of this historical event, in addition to the specialized committee formed by special representatives from both governments, it seems that the opinions of the people of both countries should also be widely solicited. Furthermore, before the execution, specialized talents should be recruited as soon as possible to establish civilian advisory bodies, or various specialized civilian committees, to provide various concrete opinions and methods for the reference of the authorities on both sides.</p>
<p>As for the transfer of enemy assets, the Japanese side also attaches particular importance to this matter. We believe that the responsible authorities will definitely handle it properly. What we want to suggest here is: first, this matter has the same important and international significance as the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions, and it is watched by the world. Especially on the side of the British and American enemies, they are constantly doing everything possible to slander the transfer of British and American industries in China under Japanese military management to the National Government. Therefore, in our country's reception and management, we must especially demonstrate our country's tradition of morality, outstanding character, and shatter all slanderous conspiracies of the enemy, so as to enhance our country's position in the international arena. Second, the takeover of enemy assets should adapt to wartime needs. For productive enemy assets, special attention should be paid to their planned increase in production to meet the needs of wartime military supplies and the daily lives of the people, and expansions should be made where they are suitable. For those suitable for management by the Chinese people, experts should be carefully selected to manage them; for those particularly suitable for management by the Japanese side, Japanese experts should be hired to continue management; or for those particularly suitable for Sino-Japanese cooperation, they should be managed in a cooperative manner. Third, the disposal of enemy assets during wartime naturally has international law to follow, and there is no need to elaborate. However, what we particularly want to point out is that, in the past year of Japanese management of enemy assets, as long as there were no hostile actions on the part of the original personnel, they were never lightly transferred, and were still allowed to continue in their positions, with guarantees for their livelihood. In terms of materials and industries, international law was absolutely observed. For example, after surveying and registering immovable properties, houses, and their internal equipment, it was strictly forbidden for anyone to move them without authorization. Even the enemy had to repeatedly praise this virtue. We should also demonstrate the demeanor of a great nation and fully inherit this virtue of the Japanese side over the past year in the enemy assets received and managed. In particular, the personnel responsible for the execution must be upright and honest, so as to bring honor to the country and not betray the trust of friendly nations in us.</p>
<p>Finally, we reiterate without reservation: this implementation of the Sino-Japanese Agreement is the beginning of sincere cooperation between China and Japan. Everyone who implements the work of the agreement will be a figure in this glorious history, and for the glory of the country, we wish the committee members success.</p>

By that morning, the landing was completed, and they are currently mopping up the nearby remnants of the army.</p>
<p>Japanese Army, a Certain Base, 16th (Central News Agency telegram) The elite troops of the Japanese army, after penetrating deep into the Chongqing 9th War Zone in the Nanchang area, defeated the Chongqing army everywhere.

<p>Tokyo, 16th (Domei News Agency telegram) Mr. Ishiwatari Shotaro, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, arrived here from Shanghai this afternoon. He is scheduled to attend Parliament and will return to Nanjing around the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>Shanghai News from Central News Agency In a draft of yesterday's (15th) interview with the press by Advisor Ishiwatari, the content of the section on monetary finance did not match the original intention and the entire section was withdrawn. The corrected draft of the section is recorded below.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of monetary finance, the ratio of Reserve Certificates to military scrip is 100 yuan to 18 yen and will not be changed. Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry has already explained this point in Parliament. The ratio of Reserve Certificates to Japanese yen after the integration of military scrip and Reserve Certificates will also be no different. This matter is quite important for Sino-Japanese relations. The relationship between Joint Reserve Bank notes, Reserve Certificates, and Manchurian currency will also not be changed. In general, it is better not to change the monetary issue under the current state of the wartime economy. Regarding the special yen issue, it is currently being studied in comparison with the relationship of the Trading Corporation submitted to Parliament. The four pillars of increasing the value of Reserve Certificates, increasing productivity, countering commodity prices, and stabilizing people's livelihood are the foundations for cultivating war power. The countermeasures include the following methods: On the one hand, issuing food coupons for the purpose of purchasing food in rural areas to suppress the release of Reserve Certificates, and on the other hand, encouraging savings. Rewards are given to those who save a certain amount of money. Although Japan does not have such a system, China has implemented it and the results have been quite good and will be actively implemented by the Central Reserve Bank. Although the issuance of lotteries has not yet been decided, it has already been implemented in Manchuria and North China, so this method can be promoted.</p>

<p>"I am aware that North China has a particularly important responsibility after China's participation in the war, so I have taken office in response to the order, regardless of personal gains and losses. Today happens to be the anniversary of China's participation in the war. I am willing to devote greater efforts to overcome difficulties and transform the environment. You are all my comrades in adversity. I sincerely hope that you will understand the spirit in which I stand, strengthen unity, and cooperate with our friendly nation, Japan. At this extraordinary time, we should do more and talk less. Under the awareness of China's self-reliant participation in the war, we should use the strength of both China and Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the most urgent task at present is to plan for increased production under the principle of security first, especially to stabilize prices, in order to stabilize people's livelihood. Secondly, we should thoroughly develop war resources, such as coal, salt, cotton and other North China specialties, and actively increase their production. Regarding personnel issues, we should not rashly make changes. The selection of personnel must be prudent, and rewards and punishments must be carried out. You should be more cautious and self-disciplined? Work hard in your positions? Good governance does not lie in many words. Implementation is paramount. Under the principle of collective wisdom, I deeply hope that you will assist me." (翔 translation, February 11th, Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

A communiqué released by the Axis side stated that German forces broke through the American lines by 20 miles, but did not mention the place name, only stating that fierce fighting is now underway and that the Gafsa position is in danger of being cut off, so the American forces may withdraw from the city. Gafsa is the railway center of southern Tunisia, and its situation is important as a crucial base for attacking the Gabès Gulf and attacking the rear of the Mareth Line. The Allied Headquarters in North Africa also admitted to withdrawing from Bou Chebka, between Gafsa and Kairouan, and announced that the American Air Force had bombed the northwest area of Sened and Maknassy, tacitly acknowledging that the British/American forces had abandoned the position between Gafsa and Bou Chebka.

<h3 id="e18">Japanese House of Peers Completes Deliberation of All Bills - Decisive Battle Posture Established - Production of Materials to Be Increased <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The 81st session of the Japanese Diet, which reopened on the 28th of last month, is about to end. The House of Peers and the House of Representatives, under the great war that determines the fate of the nation, have set the goal of establishing and strengthening combat power and other decisive battle policies, and have conducted sincere and detailed deliberations on the budget proposal for the 18th year of Showa and 88 government proposals. Of the 39 bills in the House of Peers, only the "Wartime Criminal Special Law Amendment" remained. After the explanation by Minister of Justice Iwamura, it was passed by the committee on the bill and formally passed in the plenary session on the 15th, and then transferred to the House of Representatives. Thus, the review of all bills has been completed. Starting from the first budget general meeting on the 15th, the House of Peers will actively begin deliberating on the budget proposal and the Petroleum Monopoly Law, the tax increase bill, and other 31 items delivered by the House of Representatives. Therefore, the focus of the second half of the Diet has been concentrated in the House of Peers. It is expected that the House of Peers will actively deliberate on war measures with the enthusiasm of supporting politics in order to enhance combat power. Tracing the greatest mission of this Diet session, it is to enhance the production of war materials. Among them, the Wartime Administrative Special Law Bill is the best representative. To date, all agenda items have been focused on establishing a policy of enhancing the production of aircraft, ships, steel, coal, light metals, etc. Prime Minister Tojo said on the 5th in the Special Committee on Wartime Administrative Special Laws of the House of Representatives that peaceful industries have ended, and everything is about expanding armaments. Therefore, at this time, the ideal of restoring peaceful industries should be decisively abandoned. This clearly indicates that the time has come for the whole country to resolutely rise up, especially the entire economic sector, which is directly related to enhancing production. This can also hint at the trend of this Diet session. The Japanese government's international guiding policy is also to expand and strengthen national control, but at the same time, it still avoids forcibly coercing the people and trusts in the patriotic enthusiasm of the people and makes full use of it. This is enough to show the character of Japan's decisive battle politics. However, since the entire national power is focused on enhancing the five industries, it will inevitably have a significant impact on general industries, so its adjustment policy will also become one of the important measures in the future. However, in order to implement the super-focused industry policy, the government will decisively eliminate all obstacles and actively expand armaments. This is the characteristic of this Diet session. This time, because the government and the Diet, in a consistent constructive discussion, have clarified that the combat power of the second year of the war will be enhanced, the Wartime Administrative Special Law is the center of super-focused operation. It is urgent to ask the whole country to invigorate the spirit. Therefore, the Diet has passed the supplementary budget proposal of 27 billion yuan for temporary military expenditures, the budget proposal of 10 billion yuan for the 18th year, and the tax increase bill of more than 1 billion yuan in the House of Representatives. This shows that the Japanese people have the greatest determination to do their best no matter what difficulties they encounter. As Finance Minister Kaya said, the foundation of the financial and economic posture for certain victory is built on the national income of 50 billion yuan, so it is absolutely solid. The Diet in the second half will take the House of Peers as the center and actively deliberate on the above-mentioned decisive battle measures. Also, when promoting and implementing this decisive battle plan, the Prime Minister concurrently serves as the Minister of the Army, forming a personnel-specific political and military unity system, so that national politics can be operated in accordance with the nuances of the operation. Prime Minister Tojo, at the Budget General Meeting of the House of Representatives on the 2nd, revealed his major determination as the Prime Minister of the wartime cabinet. Therefore, Japan's decisive battle posture will be completely established due to the opening of this Diet session.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki replied to Member Akio's question on countermeasures against communism at the plenary session of the House of Representatives today, saying in essence: "Based on the ideal of building Greater East Asia, communism within the Greater East Asia region must be absolutely excluded. Japan also has some viewpoints and is taking various measures. The joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo was also based on anti-communism as the fundamental spirit. The government of the Republic of China is guiding its political policy by anti-communism. However, in order to defeat the communist movement in China, it is most important for the Chinese government to strengthen its political power."</p>

<p>Istanbul, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the Iranian Parliament passed a vote of no confidence in the cabinet with 72 votes to 38, Prime Minister Qavam formally resigned on the 14th. According to a Tehran dispatch, the Iranian King has ordered former Prime Minister Soheili to organize a new cabinet. Soheili is known as a pro-Soviet person. When the German army launched the summer offensive last year, when the Soviet troops stationed in Iran were transferred to the eastern front to fight, British advisers took the opportunity to dismiss him from his post, and the pro-British Qavam was appointed as prime minister to carry out various tasks, wanting to make the Iranian government a puppet of the British and Americans. However, the policies taken by Qavam have aroused dissatisfaction from all parties, so he had to leave. It is expected that after the formation of Soheili's new cabinet, Soviet forces will once again extend into Iran.</p>

<p>German Leader's Headquarters, 16th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) - Today's German military report stated that the Soviet troops advancing southeast of Lake Ilmen and between Volkhov and Lake Ladoga were repulsed yesterday. Ninety-three Soviet tanks were destroyed. A total of 157 tanks were destroyed on all Eastern European lines yesterday. There were fierce battles on all Eastern European lines as enemy tanks and infantry attacked. Soviet troops launched a large-scale attack on our positions around Kharkov. Outnumbered, our troops fought bravely and did not retreat. Twenty Soviet tanks that rushed to the outskirts of Kharkov were destroyed. The enemy's advance north of Kursk was repulsed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) - A German communique announced yesterday that German troops had withdrawn from Rostov. This planned withdrawal is related to the fighting west and southwest of the Donets Basin. Now that German troops have abandoned positions in the eastern salient within the Donets River, the front line is shortened by about two-thirds compared to before. The German troops encountered almost no enemy resistance during the withdrawal, indicating that enemy claims of capturing large amounts of German war materiel and capturing large numbers of German soldiers are completely fabricated. The German troops withdrawn from the Donets area can now be moved to areas further north to confront Soviet troops advancing southwest to encircle the German left flank. Between the middle reaches of the Donets and Livny, Soviet troops continue to attack relentlessly, their main target being Kharkov. West and north of Kursk, German troops are putting up strong resistance, preventing any Soviet advances. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, Soviet troops are concentrating their forces in a small area, appearing to be preparing to attack there. There are no major changes in the northern sector.</p>
<p>The Rzhev Salient is an Important Factor in the Current Situation</p>
<p>Soviet Border, 15th (Havas News Agency Telegram) - Although the fighting on the Eastern Front has slowed slightly in the past 24 hours due to the cold weather, its intensity has increased unabated. The situation in each area is described below: (1) The battle for Rostov is ongoing. A large fire is still burning throughout the city. The Red Army is encountering fierce resistance in the city. German troops are still fighting and retreating. (2) In the Donets Basin, German troops are reorganizing their forces despite Red Army resistance and continuing to move troops. Although the Red Army has made slight gains near Voroshilovgrad and Shakhty, no military equipment has fallen into Red Army hands. (3) Fighting is fierce near Kharkov, especially on the front line southeast of the Ukrainian capital Chuguev. German reinforcements have arrived in the area, but the Red Army has infiltrated German positions between Belgorod and Kharkov. Fighting is also taking place near the town of Zoločiv on the Kharkov-Bryansk railway. The Germans admit that a gap has been opened in their defense line there, but the gap has been filled after the Germans moved heavy artillery units to the front line. The situation there seems extremely chaotic, but it is not impossible for the Red Army to be surrounded by the Germans after penetrating deep into German lines. (4) General Golikov's troops attempted to attack northwest and north of Kursk, apparently aiming for the Bryansk-Kharkov railway, but were unsuccessful. (5) There were no major battles on other fronts, but observers believe that the Rzhev line salient is an important factor in the current situation. It is expected that the Red Army will either attack the area or the Germans will decide to shorten their lines. (6) The Red Army has repeatedly attacked southeast and south of Leningrad, but has been repulsed by German artillery. German troops there continue to defend major railway hubs, especially the Slutsk station southeast of Leningrad, so the Red Army remains in a disadvantageous position.</p>

<p>Rising Prices</p>
<p>The Indian government and major Indian businesses, in view of the daily rise in prices of daily necessities, are now providing their employees with "cost-of-living allowances" to compensate them. The prices of some daily necessities have risen to five or six times their pre-war levels. Apart from occasional air raids, India has not yet experienced war, but its people are already suffering from shortages of consumer goods and rising prices. Some areas of India are currently experiencing a shortage of this staple food due to the ban on rice exports from Burma. The Bombay government is promoting the consumption of brown rice, and the government of Kashmir Province is taking active steps to ban the hoarding of grain by grain merchants and the sale of grain on the black market at prices higher than those set by the government. Due to the rationing of gasoline, many car owners in India are abandoning their cars or using horse-drawn carriages or bicycles instead, or converting their vehicles to charcoal-burning vehicles.</p>
<p>Increasing Enlistments</p>
<p>The Department of India and Burma Affairs announced on December 5th of last year that the average number of Indians joining the Indian Army in the four months from June to September of this year was more than 68,000 per month, compared to an average of 47,000 per month during the same period last year.

<h3 id="e42">North China in the First Month of the Declaration of War <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xin Yin</p>
<p>The Spring Festival had just passed when we encountered the first anniversary of the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States. The declaration of war caused a watershed change in North China, which had been in a state of emergency for five years. Since January 9th, everything, even the air, has felt different!</p>
<p>North China has always been designated as the "front line of anti-communism" and the "rear base of the Greater East Asia War," and has considered itself a "specialized" area. However, since the Greater East Asia War entered its decisive second year and the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, North China's special mission has been shouldered by all of China, so North China's "special character" no longer exists. Having shed its special colors and donned the wartime cloak, North China has shown many new signs in general psychology and various factual manifestations over the past month:</p>
<p>First: Manifestations in Political Institutions</p>
<p>Simplifying wartime political institutions is what Japan has recently been doing. North China after the declaration of war has also entered the wartime system, and political institutions naturally need to be adjusted. On the other hand, how the North China Political Affairs Commission, the entire political institution, will evolve in this new era of the New China participating in the Greater East Asia War is also generally expected.</p>
<p>The death of Yin Tong, a standing committee member of the North China Political Affairs Commission who concurrently held 18 important positions, including the Construction Department Commissioner and the New People's Association Vice President, caused a great shock to the North China Political Affairs Commission. Yin's vacancy and the demands of the entire structure of the Political Affairs Commission led to the recent major personnel changes. These changes occurred in three stages: Announced on January 20th, Yu Jinhe, the mayor of Beiping, was transferred to succeed as Construction Department Commissioner. Announced on January 28th: Su Tiren, the governor of Shanxi Province, was transferred to succeed as the mayor of Beiping, with Feng Sizhi, the president of the Shanxi New People's Daily, as the governor of Shanxi Province. Announced on February 9th: Shi Yitang, the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission and Commissioner of the Internal Affairs Department, and Zhou Zuoren, the Commissioner of the Education Department, resigned, with Zhu Shen succeeding as chairman, Qi Xieyuan concurrently serving as Commissioner of the Internal Affairs Department, and Su Tiren, who had just taken office as the mayor of Beiping for eight days, was transferred to be the Commissioner of the Education Department. Then came a large number of appointments and transfers of middle and lower-level officials who followed their superiors. At the same time as the replacement of the old and new chairmen, the list of all members of the Political Affairs Commission (including incumbents and new members) was re-determined by the National Government, and the organizational regulations of the various departments under the Political Affairs Commission were also officially announced. The Political Affairs Commission, which was brewing to strengthen the institution and simplify personnel, thus achieved temporary stability.</p>
<p>However, the hearts of the people of North China under wartime are tense and full of hope. Although the Political Affairs Commission has a new face in terms of personnel, the atmosphere of thoroughly renewing its image still permeates all levels of society. It is generally believed that the time for the New China and the New Central Government to unify and strengthen wartime political institutions is not far off.</p>
<p>Second: The National Flag is No Longer Substituted with the Five-Color Flag</p>
<p>Following the National Government's official order to abolish the national flag with emblems, the North China Political Affairs Commission also issued a notice on the 9th of this month prohibiting the use of the Five-Color Flag as a substitute for the national flag. Note: Since the National Government returned to its capital, the national flag has been seen again in North China, but only government agencies and schools can hang it. Merchants and civilians still unanimously use the Five-Color Flag. On the 9th of this month, the first anniversary of the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, merchants and civilians throughout Beiping automatically hung out national flags without emblems. The restoration of the national flag in North China gave people a great excitement.</p>
<p>Third, the New Trends of the New People's Association</p>
<p>The New People's Association is also one of the special institutions in North China after the incident. However, today, its character is very different from the past. At the end of October last year, when the third New People's Association National Federation was held, it was honored by the presence of Chairman Wang, who gave two speeches to the conference. The hearts of the entire conference were greatly inspired, and unanimously ignited the enthusiasm to support the chairman. It was at that conference that the major event of changing the program of the New People's Association was decided. The New People's Association began to be spiritually led by Chairman Wang. After the National Government declared war, the New People's Association held a "Participation in the War National Federation" on January 20th, and unanimously passed a resolution to elect Chairman Wang as the honorary chairman of the association. On the same day, they received a reply from the chairman, agreeing to accept. All the members of the association were overjoyed. Since then, the New People's Association has been led by the chairman in name and in fact!</p>
<p>The center of what the New People's Association now calls "association movement" (association work) is focused on the New National Movement, and spiritually, it is one with the East Asia League. Its new evolution, like that of the Commission, is being generally expected.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Reflection of Finance and Prices</p>
<p>North China is the area of the United Reserve Bank, and the official exchange rate of the United Reserve Bank for the reserve currency is ten to three. In fact, at the end of November last year, the black market exchange rate was still ten to two point one two. Only after the declaration of war did it rise to ten to two point seven. Now it is continuing to rise, with a tendency to break the official exchange rate. The financial community unanimously believes that the reserve currency will soon become two to one against the United Reserve Bank. This shows the tendency of the people of North China towards the central government.</p>
<p>However, under wartime, the general psychology has always tended to value the possession of materials. Therefore, it has caused the rise in prices. Therefore, since January of this year, various prices have risen uniformly. Food is the most prominent. For example, the price of each dan of rice was 300 yuan in early January, and it has risen to 440 yuan in early February. Each bag of flour was 50 yuan in early January, and recently it has risen to 75 yuan. Each jin of millet and corn flour (the staple food of the common people) was only 7 jiao in early January, and it has risen to 1 yuan 7 or 8 jiao in early February. After the Spring Festival, the first news of the market opening was two shocking price increases, namely a 36-yuan increase in the price of every hundred jin of millet and corn, and a 470-yuan surge in the price of every tael of pure gold (from 450 yuan per tael to 920 yuan per tael), which is a rare and crazy rise in recent years.</p>
<p>The Chinese and Japanese authorities in Beiping have also tried to find ways to save the food shortage, but the food shortage in Beiping is not only due to hoarding by unscrupulous merchants, but also due to the blockage of sources. Therefore, they are planning in many ways. The authorities had already prepared a rationing method (i.e., distributing grain according to the number of people), but it was suspended because the food reserves in Beiping were too low and the sources were not sustained. If food prices continue to rise wildly, a city-wide food rationing must be held. In addition, not only is there a panic about food, but also edible oil, soy sauce, and white sugar, which are known to have abundant stocks, are also feeling the shortage. In general, it is deeply felt that Beiping will soon be like the citizens of Shanghai, who will have to be familiar with the flavor of squeezing rice, oil, and sugar.</p>
<p>Fifth, the Education Sector's Increase Production Movement</p>
<p>The education sector in North China, especially in Beiping, has been busy strengthening public security in the past two or three years. Since the declaration of war, it has focused its goal on "increasing production education." The Education Department recently issued a notice to all schools in North China to uniformly add agricultural courses, open agricultural training centers and agricultural fields, and students at all levels must participate in agricultural labor. This is the Education Department's plan to mobilize millions of students in North China to engage in agricultural production.</p>
<p>The first month of the declaration of war in North China is roughly as described above. Let's see what happens in the second month!</p>

<h3 id="e43">Authorities Strictly Prohibit Exceeding Price Limits, Four Major Silver Shops Sealed Up, Because of Raising the Listed Price of Jewelry, The Investigation and Sealing Up of Illegal Silver Shops will Continue from Today <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Since the authorities issued a formal announcement on the 24th of last month, limiting the selling price of all goods to the price set on January 23rd, the reporter has learned that the authorities have implemented emergency measures and are strictly investigating businesses that violate the rules. It has been found that gold bars, which are also subject to price limits by the authorities at 3,000 yuan per tael, are still being traded among unscrupulous merchants in defiance of the law and in blatant violation of the price limits. Starting from Lunar New Year's Eve, the price was repeatedly increased on the black market to as much as 3,900 yuan per tael, and they were still unwilling to sell. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, the four shops on Nanjing Road - Datong, Tianbao, Fang Jiuxia, Laofengxiang, and Xinfengxiang - were sealed up. The seals were inscribed with the words: "This shop has violated the Bureau's emergency regulations and is hereby ordered to cease business immediately. If any citizens discover hoarding, illegal profiteering, or other violations of the Bureau's regulations, they should report them to the Bureau for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law. By order, Shanghai Municipal Council." Upon hearing this news, other silver shops in the two concessions closed their doors and suspended business one after another.</p>
<p>Request to Lift the Sealing</p>
<p>After the four major silver shops were sealed up, the Silver Shop Guild held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to send representatives to petition the authorities, stating the circumstances of jewelry sales and requesting that the sealing be lifted to maintain business, and that they would absolutely comply with the authorities' price limits for buying and selling. As for gold bar transactions, they had already been ordered to stop, and the black market for gold had also ceased operations. It is said that the authorities have accepted the request, so the sealed silver shops are expected to reopen for business from today. As for the price of jewelry, it is currently under review, and before a new price limit is set, the original price limit of 3,000 yuan per tael must be strictly observed, and violators will be severely investigated to maintain the authority of the authorities' laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheng's Remarks</p>
<p>In order to understand the truth, the reporter specially visited Mr. Sheng Yudu, Assistant to the Director-General of the Municipal Council. According to him, in order to stabilize people's livelihood, the authorities have imposed price limits on various industries and goods, especially gold bars, because the rise and fall of gold prices affect all industries. The price limit for gold bars has been assessed by the Materials Control Department at 3,000 yuan per tael. Initially, all silver shops were able to comply with the price limit for transactions, but in recent weeks, the situation has suddenly changed, with each other raising market prices and engaging in black market sales, reaching as much as 3,900 yuan per tael. The authorities have repeatedly warned against this, but these people have turned a deaf ear, which is very regrettable. Although the silver shop industry has sent representatives to the Bureau to express their grievances and request a change in the price limit, and the authorities are considering it, the industry rashly and automatically raised black market prices, so the authorities had no choice but to take severe measures, seal them up, and impose fines as a warning. Even if they are reopened in the future, they must still maintain the price limit of 3,000 yuan per tael. As for the other silver shops in the two concessions, some of them have violated the price limit and will continue to be sealed up and punished from today, he said.</p>

<p>In addition to North China and Guangdong, where place names have already been added to domestic stamps, it has been said that postal authorities will also add place names to stamps sold in the postal districts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei to distinguish them. This principle has been confirmed, but the implementation date has been repeatedly postponed. Recently, it has been learned that the postal authorities are reconsidering the above measures, so whether or not they will be implemented is uncertain.</p>

<p>In order to stabilize finance, the Ministry of Finance, after promulgating the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions and the Implementing Rules, first handled the registration of financial institutions (banks and money shops), established an office to inspect financial affairs to inspect the business of financial institutions, and stipulated that all banks and money shops opening for business must join group organizations. As a result, the number of banks and money shops joining the banking and money shop guilds as members has increased in recent years. It has been learned that since this year, the members who joined the Banking Association in January include Dahua, Yongming, and China Agricultural Development, and the banks that joined the Association in February include Huatai, Huizhong, Zhenye, Xinhua, Taihexing, and Donghua. Currently, the number of members of the Banking Association has increased to 107.</p>

<p>Mr. Kodama Kenji, president of the Central China Revitalization Company, who came to Shanghai from Tokyo on the 16th of last month to handle the merger and reorganization of Japanese national policy companies in Central China, left Shanghai for Nanjing yesterday to consult with senior figures in the financial community. It has been learned that Mr. Kodama has had repeated discussions with Chinese and Japanese military, political, and diplomatic figures in Shanghai since his arrival. This trip to Beijing is to finalize the final decision with the highest authorities, with particular attention to economic issues such as the merger and allocation of Chinese and Japanese capital.</p>
<h3 id="e47">The 27th Ration of Household Rice Decided to Increase by Half a Sheng, A Total of One and a Half Sheng of White Rice or Brown Rice and One Sheng of Broken Rice <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>After the authorities implemented the rationing of food to Shanghai citizens, the Japanese authorities are responsible for finding ways to dredge the source of food, which is distributed by the concession authorities to the contracted rice shops, and sold with rice purchase certificates and flour purchase certificates.</p>
<p>The First Batch of Foreign Rice Has Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Foreign rice has now been ordered from Bangkok, Vietnam, and other places. The first batch of foreign rice from Bangkok has arrived in Shanghai, and a huge amount of rice will continue to be shipped in to help. As for the purchase of domestic rice from various production areas, it has been shipped to Shanghai in an endless stream, so the rice reserves in Shanghai are indeed more abundant than before. At the same time, the flour produced by various factories in Central China will be supplied as much as possible for the rationing of people's livelihood. Therefore, in the future, sufficient rations will be given according to the legitimate needs of the food households. Regarding the 27th ration of household food, the amount of whole rice, broken rice, and flour on the purchase orders received by the contracted rice shops is the same as in this period. Recently, the authorities said that the contracted rice shops had surplus rice and flour, which should be used as the shop's reserves in accordance with the contract, and the authorities would often send people to investigate. In case of shortages, a fine of ten times the value of the shortage would be imposed. Recently, the Municipal Council thought that the amount of broken rice stored by the rice shops was relatively large.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Broken Rice Supplemented for Distribution in Each Shop <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Therefore, in addition to distributing the same amount of rice and grain as in this period, the broken rice stored in each shop will be supplemented for distribution, with a total amount of one and a half sheng of white rice or brown rice and one sheng of broken rice, totaling two and a half sheng, and the amount of flour distributed will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The Last Day for This Period's Household Rice</p>
<p>Here is the notice issued by the Municipal Council: Rice purchase certificate and flour purchase certificate No. 26 are allowed to be used until the 17th of this month. They will be invalid after the expiration date. From the 19th to the 27th of this month, the rice shops and the rice sales offices of the Bureau will only sell rice and flour based on the No. 27 certificate. At that time, the rice shops with the registered number on the certificate will distribute one and a half sheng of white rice or brown rice and one sheng of broken rice for each rice purchase certificate, with a total selling price of six yuan and three jiao. Each flour purchase certificate will be used to distribute one jin and twelve liang of flour, with a selling price of three yuan and eight jiao and five fen. Also, the rice shops and the rice sales offices of the Bureau will stop selling for one day on the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>The Rationing of Grain in the Southern City in the First Ten Days of This Month Started Universally Yesterday</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau has completed the distribution of grain and rice for the first ten days of this month in the urban area, and the bureaus have ordered the public offices to pay and release the rice one after another. Each person is allocated two sheng of japonica rice per ten days, with a selling price of five yuan and one jiao.</p>
<p>The rationing of grain in the southern city area started universally yesterday, and the districts of Pudong, Huxi, and Zhabei will also start rationing within days. According to a spokesman for the Grain Management Bureau, the rationing of grain this month was delayed due to personnel changes in the Grain Bureau. Director Zhang is issuing instructions to all departments under his jurisdiction to do everything possible to ensure that the rationing of grain in each district can start on schedule, and that it should not be delayed unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, the relevant departments of the Grain Bureau are actively preparing for the rationing of grain in the middle ten days of this month.</p>

<p>In order to promote the strength of the police in the cleared areas to maintain local public security, the Municipal Police Bureau specially transferred more than 70 outstanding police officers from the area to hold a special training class at the Pudong Police Training Institute, to provide them with special training and enhance their police knowledge. As the training period has expired, a graduation ceremony was held a few days ago.

<p>Domei News Agency Shanghai - At a regular press conference on Tuesday, Hirota, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, criticized President Roosevelt's speech, saying that the Axis powers are determined to build a new type of country, so that the next century will not only have a new domestic relationship, but also a readjusted international relationship. Hirota strongly refuted Roosevelt's claim that the Allied powers are the protectors of modern culture and that the Axis powers are barbaric countries, saying that the Axis powers will never tolerate the Allied powers' war aims and solemnly declared, "We must fight to the end to smash this organization."</p>

<p>The City Government has not approved the request of the Shanghai Photography Industry Association to change the selling price to three yuan for six photos from New Year's Day of the 32nd year, which was submitted by the police bureau for record, because the majority of the people in the urban area are poor, and how can the prices be allowed to rise in the midst of suppressing prices? The police bureau has been ordered to inform them.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Mr. Chen Jicheng, Ambassador to Manchukuo, Hosted a Tea Party Yesterday for All Circles, with Over Three Hundred Chinese and Foreign Guests Attending, an Unprecedented Occasion <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Jicheng, State Councilor of the National Government and concurrently the Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Manchukuo, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. He has been extremely busy handling various official matters. Chinese and foreign newspapers have praised him as a prominent figure in finance and education. It is expected that Sino-Manchukuo relations will have further contact and the Japan-Manchukuo-China axis will be further cemented. Amidst the calls for the revival of China and the defense of East Asia, Mr. Chen's ambassadorship to Manchukuo is seen as being entrusted with a particularly great mission. Many people have initiated celebrations and farewells. However, Mr. Chen, in line with the Central Government's promotion of the New Life Movement and advocacy of frugality, has politely declined these offers. However, to express his farewell to various circles in Shanghai and to exchange views, he held a grand tea party yesterday afternoon from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM on the 14th floor of the International Hotel at the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse, inviting people from all walks of life. The scene was bustling with activity, an unprecedented event. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>The tea party began promptly at 4:00 PM. Ambassador Chen, dressed in formal attire, personally hosted the reception, assisted by Sun Yucai, Xie Zhongfu, Hu Shouqi, Sun Lifu, Chen Zhonghang, and Chen Yiyi, among others. Chinese government officials in attendance included Minister Chu Minyi, State Councilor Zhao Zhengping, Economic Affairs Committee member Huang Xianggu, various bureau chiefs of the municipal government, and directors of various National Government offices in Shanghai. Leaders from various sectors included Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Pei Yunqing, Wang Boyun, Shen Siliang, Xu Jianping, Yang Xinghua, Xu Guanqun, Zhou Bangjun, Xie Xiaochu, Chen Bin, Xu Liqiu, Pan Da, Chen Riping, and others. Foreign officials included Minister Tientsin Yano, the British Consul-General, Nagai, Iwai, Tasei, Chiyo, Colonel Takase, as well as ministers and consuls from various countries' embassies and legations, Inspector General of the Public Works Department Du Zheng, French Police Chief Sarri, and French Consul-General Magre, among others, totaling over three hundred people. Champagne and refreshments were served, and attendees exchanged greetings of health and well-being in an atmosphere of harmony and friendship. The scene was rare, symbolizing that Mr. Chen's mission will be completed successfully and swiftly.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's Remarks</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency, recognizing the great significance of Ambassador Chen's mission, paid a special visit to the International Hotel to interview him and request a statement. Mr. Chen, despite his busy schedule, granted the interview, stating that after being appointed by the National Government as the Ambassador of the Republic of China to Manchukuo, he immediately issued a brief statement. In the future, he will uphold national policies and, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, strive for closer cooperation between China and Manchukuo and the completion of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, having lived in Shanghai for thirty years, he feels deeply sentimental about his departure. Shanghai has been invaded by British and American imperialism, suffering humiliation for a century, which everyone deeply resents. Having worked in the economic and educational sectors, he has personally experienced the economic and cultural aggression of Britain and America. Now, thanks to our friendly nation Japan's dedication to the Greater East Asia War, the aggressive forces of Britain and America are being destroyed, and the concessions will also be recovered. From now on, Shanghai will regain its freedom, and all undertakings of revival and construction are flourishing. Whenever he thinks of this, he feels infinitely attached to Shanghai, his second home. He sincerely hopes that friends from all walks of life will stay in touch so that he can get their guidance and suggestions. Since returning to the capital, he has been constantly busy, and he is going on this mission with the determination to work hard and complete it successfully. Ambassador Chen left for Nanjing by night train that evening due to important official duties.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Mortgage Deeds Previously Pledged to Banks and Firms to be Released from Enemy Asset Status, with Transferred and Replaced Japanese Deeds Permitted as Continued Collateral <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Banks and firms in the silver and money industries are permitted to accept mortgage deeds that have been released from enemy asset status. The United Banking Association and Money Trade Reserve are allowing member banks and firms to use these deeds as collateral for borrowing. Real estate transactions have resumed, which helps the overall financial situation, increases market activity, and facilitates the flow of capital. A reporter learned from the silver and money industries yesterday that for pledge items previously handled by various banks and firms, except for foreign firms in neutral countries registered with neutral consulates, all deeds registered as enemy assets of the British and American systems have been applied for and released from enemy asset status by the banks and firms and replaced with Japanese registry deeds. Therefore, all pledged deeds have been completely transferred. Furthermore, deeds that have been transferred and replaced with Japanese registry deeds are permitted to continue as collateral. However, for deeds that have not been transferred, each household will apply for release through the relevant bank or firm. Deeds that have not been approved for release will require debtors to expedite the process or replace them with other collateral.</p>

<p>To promptly eradicate the evil practice of smuggling, the Jianghai Customs previously ordered all customs police to strictly enforce anti-smuggling measures. Any goods without proper documentation attempting to be transported out of the country would be treated as smuggled goods. The customs police or related personnel would detain the goods and hand them over to customs for investigation and punishment according to law. Since the customs initiated these rigorous measures a month ago, over one hundred cases of smuggled goods have been seized. Depending on the severity of the offense, fines are imposed, or the entire consignment is confiscated. It was learned from the Anti-Smuggling Section of the General Affairs Department of the Customs that generally, merchants were now wary of the strict anti-smuggling measures, so the number of cases had decreased. However, the Customs authorities are determined to uphold their original intention and make unremitting efforts to eliminate smuggling completely. It was also learned that a large batch of smuggled goods previously detained by the Customs has been released after the owners paid the fines.</p>

<p>Letters from Mr. Zhou and Mr. Bao</p>
<p>We received a letter from Mr. Zhou, whose name is withheld, which reads: "This year marks the 25th anniversary of my stay in Shanghai. My friends in the industry have offered lavish celebrations, which I have resolutely declined repeatedly. I am ashamed of my inadequacy and lack of achievements. At a time when the nation is facing difficulties and the people are suffering, how can I bear to indulge in extravagance and increase my guilt? I respectfully offer a modest amount as a scholarship fund and small loan fund, hoping to benefit others and make amends for my past. I hope you will publish the receipts for distribution. Sincerely, Zhou (anonymous), dated February 15th, 32nd year of the Republic, enclosing 2,940 yuan, which I have supplemented with 1,500 yuan, totaling 4,440 yuan."</p>

<h3 id="e58">English Classes Canceled in Public Elementary Schools, Tuition Increased by 20% <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The second semester of the 31st year of the Republic for the Chinese public schools established by the Shanghai Municipal Council began simultaneously on the 12th of this month. Tuition fees for the public schools have increased slightly this semester, with an average increase of 20%. However, the tuition fees vary from school to school. Generally, the tuition fee for a middle school semester is about 150 yuan, while for elementary schools it is around 72 yuan, which is much lower than ordinary private primary and secondary schools. According to reliable sources, starting this semester, English classes in all Chinese elementary schools of the Shanghai Municipal Council, whether advanced or elementary, have been ordered to be canceled. The hours previously used to teach English will be used to teach Japanese. The amount of English taught in the middle schools will also be reduced, while the time allocated to Japanese will be increased. The Kezhi Middle School, established by the Shanghai Municipal Council, was originally located on Great Western Road. This semester, it has been moved into the Yucai Public School on Shanhai Pass Road, where classes will continue as usual.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Universally Open the Iron Gates in Nanshi <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Chaoran</p>
<p>The Nanshi area of Shanghai has been desolate since the "August 13th" Incident, with nine out of ten houses empty. Although it has gradually recovered its prosperity, it is limited to the Laoximen and Nine Acres areas. Other areas remain like small towns in the countryside.</p>
<p>Any resident of Nanshi knows that the reason for this is the failure to universally open the iron gates built in the Hua-French boundary area (Minguo Road). As a result, storefronts on Minguo Road remain closed, and there are few pedestrians. Its desolate state is rare in Shanghai.</p>
<p>However, Dongmen Road near the Sixteen Pu, the Lao Beimenkou, the Xinjiao Street intersection, the Laoximen of Nanyang Bridge, and Xujiahui are all bustling with activity and commercial prosperity like the concessions because the iron gates at the boundaries there have been opened.</p>
<p>It is thought that the French Concession authorities' closure of the iron gates at the boundaries has been in place for nearly six years since the incident. The public has repeatedly requested their universal opening, but it has not yet been approved. Recently, the situation has worsened. The section of Minguo Road along the French Concession from Lao Beimenkou to Xin Beimenkou is piled with dirty soil, reaching seven or eight feet high, stretching like an earthen mountain. The intention is incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The authorities built these boundaries at the time of the "August 13th" Incident because of the war, in order to ensure the security of the concession. After the war moved west, it was because the status of the concession and the Chinese area were completely different, so there was still a reason not to open them at this time; but since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the formal participation of the National Government in the war today, the concessions and the Chinese area have long been integrated. Although the French Concession is an exception, it has long been tacitly understood in spirit. Therefore, there should no longer be this unreasonable blockade policy to prevent the prosperity of Nanshi, which also hinders the restoration of the entire Shanghai urban area. The 300,000 residents of Nanshi hope for a clear explanation.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Improving Traffic on Macheng Road <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Wen</p>
<p>Last September, the Shanghai Municipal Council commissioned a foreign firm (Belgian?) to repair the ditches on Macheng Road. The project was originally scheduled to be completed in three weeks, but it has been over four months and it is still not finished. The project is indeed large, but it is undeniable that the workers are not working hard to complete it.</p>
<p>Macheng Road is a major transportation route, the only way from the central concession to the northwest area. Tram lines 16, 19, and 21 run through it, and these three tram lines are extremely crowded, mostly with workers. Since the traffic was cut off, the trams stop abruptly at Sanbanqiao Xinqiao, and passengers must walk over a bumpy and uneven road for more than half a mile before they can wait for the tram again on the northern section of Macheng Road to go north, which is extremely inconvenient, especially on rainy days when it is difficult to walk because the unpaved road is muddy. At night, people often fall and get injured, and not only is there the trouble of walking and changing trams halfway, but passengers also have to pay more for the trip. Once any unfortunate event occurs, ambulances cannot enter, let alone fire trucks. There is a great wish for public order and safety. For this reason, the Municipal Council should urge the workers to complete the work on time and not deliberately delay it.</p>
<p>Along the river on Macheng Road, there is a lot of garbage piled up like mountains, stretching for dozens of feet, creating a spectacle. A strange stench wafts in the air. A similar situation exists in the Tokyo Road area. Although the transition from spring to winter will not cause an epidemic, it is still detrimental to hygiene, and the higher it is piled, the more difficult it is to clear. There are also places where it falls and obstructs traffic. It is unknown why the contractor responsible for transporting the garbage does not use boats to transport it to the countryside to be used as fertilizer but instead dumps it on Macheng Road. It is hoped that the authorities will thoroughly investigate this matter to emphasize hygiene.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Cotton Cloth, Leather Shoes, and Leather to Implement Rationing System <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Managed by a Special Department of the Trade Association, Aiming to Control the Source of Goods to Ensure Constant Supply. According to well-informed sources in the industrial and commercial sectors, items such as cloth from wooden weaving factories, cotton cloth, leather shoes, and leather in this city have been planned by trade associations related to these goods to adopt a rationing system. This measure was not initiated by any high-level authorities, but rather by a group of shop owners for the convenience of promoting their own business, mutually agreed upon and unanimously advocated. It is learned that the implementation steps are to first urge stores wishing to participate in the rationing to register with the association, and then the registered stores will raise funds to establish a rationing department within the relevant association to specialize in this matter.</p>
<p>Five Tasks of the Rationing Department</p>
<p>The rationing department is similar to a company organization, and participating stores must be able to bear unlimited liability. Once formally established, it will generally carry out the following tasks: (1) Negotiate with the relevant goods control authorities to control the source of goods, so that the raw materials or finished products of these items can maintain a constant supply without fear of interruption. (2) Register all the inventory of these items in Shanghai to prevent merchants from hoarding and selling at high prices. (3) Regularly and periodically allocate appropriate amounts of raw materials or finished products fairly to the relevant stores. (4) Negotiate with the authorities to facilitate the legal transportation of goods, and jointly expand business to other cities. (5) Establish a separate evaluation committee to evaluate prices in accordance with the established policies of the authorities, and order the affiliated industries to comply. Violators will be subject to suspension of rationing.</p>
<p>Leather Shoe Prices to be Classified and Approved</p>
<p>It is also learned that leather shoe prices have been soaring in the past. For example, the black market price of first-class textured leather, such as the leather used to make leather shoe soles, has reached about 110 yuan per pound. In order to lower retail prices and reduce manufacturing costs, the concession authorities ordered all wholesalers and manufacturers in Shanghai not to exceed the selling prices of January 23 this year, and ordered them to submit their cost and selling price lists for review. Therefore, the leather shoe industry has agreed on the prices of various styles of men's and women's shoes, with 33 types of men's shoes and 30 types of women's shoes, each type divided into special, first, second, third, fourth, and fifth grades, totaling more than 300 types. The cost and selling price lists were submitted to the Goods Control Department of the Public and Common Concession Bureau on the 12th of this month for review and approval, and the prices will be fixed and announced soon.</p>

<p>A factory room at No. 68 Tokyo Road in Shanghai West, the Hezhong Electric Welding Factory, had a cylinder containing ammonia. Yesterday afternoon at about 5 o'clock, the cylinder exploded suddenly due to overheating, with a thunderous sound. Six workers were injured and fell to the ground. Wang Xiaohua, 25 years old, from Dinghai, suffered severe burns to the face and feet; Jiang Bingsheng, 17 years old, from Haimen, injured his face; Pan Zhengrong, 27 years old, from Nanjing, injured his face; Zhou Guoliang, 17 years old, from Wuxi; Li Mingen, 19 years old, from Ningbo; and Yu Huaiyu, 31 years old, from Ningbo, all suffered burns to their arms and faces. After the incident, the factory urgently called an ambulance to the scene and sent the injured to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has recently issued Notification No. 6263, stating that the sale of pufferfish within the Public Concession is prohibited unless approved. Those approved to sell and their customers must burn the discarded parts of the pufferfish or send them to the nearest sanitary branch for disposal, and must not throw them into the garbage dump or other places at will, so as to prevent beggars from picking them up and using them as food, which would lead to danger. Violators will be severely punished.</p>

<p>Retail oil stores in the two concessions have not sold oil since the Lunar New Year. However, according to reporters, the edible oil wholesalers have already submitted a plan for rationing oil based on population size to the authorities for approval last month. However, it is learned that the amount of edible oil stored in this city is not sufficient to fully meet the demand. Therefore, oil companies are actively seeking ways to procure goods. It is said that the twelve oil factories affiliated with the China Central Oil Company have been processing soybeans day and night since a large shipment of soybeans arrived from Dalian. It is expected that after this batch of edible oil is produced, the oil shortage in this city will be eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="e65">A Tragic Incident of a Shell Explosion Occurred at the Xiaomubiao in Longhua, Three Boys Were Injured While Playing with Shells, Two More Shells Were Found and Transported to the Bureau for Storage <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 4 p.m., a tragic incident of a shell explosion occurred near the Xiaomubiao on Longhua Road, and three boys were seriously injured on the spot. The details were learned by this newspaper's reporter and are recorded below:</p>
<p>After School, Playing in a Wasteland</p>
<p>Zhang Baihua (14 years old), son of Zhang Lucai, a local resident of No. 25 Zhangjiazhai, Longhua, as well as Hu Anqing (15 years old), son of Hu Zhangshi, and Zhang Weiren (15 years old), son of Zhang Yingfeng, went to play in the wasteland near Xiaomubiao on Longhua Road after school as usual at around 4 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Shell Explodes, Suffering Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the three boys picked up a long shell. Not knowing the danger, they were overjoyed and played with it. It accidentally slipped from their hands and fell to the ground, suddenly exploding with a deafening sound. Shrapnel flew everywhere, causing Zhang Baihua, Hu Anqing, and Zhang Weiren to be wounded all over their bodies.</p>
<p>The Three Injured Children Were Taken to the Hospital</p>
<p>After the incident, Yang Genhai, the son of the seventh Bao head of the area, happened to see it, so he urgently reported the situation to the parents of the three boys. The parents were shocked to hear the news and immediately rushed to the scene, seeing the three children lying in pools of blood, barely breathing and unable to speak. They then tried their best to send the three injured boys to Zhongshan Hospital on Xietu Road for treatment. It is said that the injuries were quite serious, and their lives were in danger.</p>
<p>Two Shells Were Also Recovered</p>
<p>At the same time, the police authorities in charge of the area, upon hearing the report, also sent personnel to investigate. As a result, in addition to recovering a shell near the bamboo fence of the vegetable garden in the courtyard of a resident named Yin Zhaodi near the scene, they also found a shell in a pile of rubble, both of which were long and cylindrical. Upon careful inspection, it was found that they had rusted heavily due to the passage of time. They were transported to the headquarters for storage. It is believed that these shells fell into the brick and tile piles during the previous Shanghai war.</p>
<h3 id="e66">The School Building Maintenance Association Hosts the Press, Appealing for Social Sympathy to Maintain Students' Studies <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Middle and Elementary School Building Maintenance Movement Committee hosted the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department and members of the press at the Jinmen Hotel yesterday afternoon. Over fifty people attended, including Director Feng of the Propaganda Department Office and reporters from newspapers and news agencies.</p>
<p>Chairman Reports</p>
<p>First, Wang Yunyou, the representative of the chairman of the committee, reported on the purpose of the meeting and the progress of the school building maintenance movement, saying that the inability of middle and elementary schools in the city to start classes due to being forced to move by school building owners is becoming increasingly serious. Most owners are appealing to the law in such cases, so that the schools lose their cases. Recently, Shicheng Middle School has encountered a bad fate, and the number of schools involved in school building disputes is increasing. Because 98% of the city's more than 700 middle and elementary schools rent their buildings from owners. The situation is serious, and it will affect education in the city, with more than 200,000 students at risk of dropping out of school, and more than 10,000 teachers and staff at risk of unemployment. Although we have repeatedly sought assistance from all relevant parties, there have been no practical measures taken. Therefore, we urgently need to appeal for social sympathy, mobilize public opinion, and awaken the conscience of the owners to reduce the pressure on the schools and enable hundreds of schools in the city to continue to maintain students' studies.</p>
<p>Director Feng Speaks</p>
<p>After the chairman's report, Director Feng of the Propaganda Department spoke, saying that he deeply sympathizes with colleagues in the education sector who have been struggling in difficult situations to cultivate knowledgeable young people for several years. Education is a major element of national strength, and the government should maintain it. In the future, the press and the Propaganda Department will do their best to promote public awareness. Finally, representatives of the press spoke one after another, expressing their sympathy for the matter.</p>

<p>The detention center of the Military Law Department of this city's Security Command Headquarters houses over 360 inmates. Following the implementation of the first phase of the "Purification Campaign" in Shanghai, more than 140 cases handled by the Fourth Division of the Purification Committee have also been transferred to the detention center. Recently, Mr. Li Shiyu, the Director of the Military Law Department, recognizing that inmates have few opportunities for activity while detained, which is detrimental to their health, has specially established an inmate work unit. Work will be assigned to each inmate, allowing them to engage in production and regulate their mental state. We have learned that since preparations began, everything is in order. Sixty machines have been purchased to produce knitted goods such as towels. Once the results are satisfactory, the operation will be expanded. However, raw materials such as cotton yarn are controlled items, and most merchants are hoarding and unwilling to sell. After dispatching personnel to exhaust all means, only a small amount for initial use was purchased. In the future, the department will strive to obtain raw materials to ensure that the operation is not affected.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Local Transportation Trade Associations Should Establish Joint Business Offices to Coordinate with Japanese Transportation Organizations to Promote Water and Land Transportation Services in Various Regions <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the incident, transportation services in and around Beijing, Shanghai, and other regions have gradually recovered, but the organizational structure is still quite chaotic. At the same time, various Japanese transportation organizations, such as Central China Railway, Central China Shipping, Central China Transportation, and Inland River Shipping companies, have emerged and are expanding their businesses alongside local Chinese transportation companies. Each operates independently, with no coordination. Therefore, the promotion of transportation services has not been rationalized. Our reporter has learned that the relevant authorities, to improve local transportation services and rationalize the flow of goods, have issued a "Outline for the Establishment of Joint Business Offices by Local Transportation Industries," instructing local transportation trade associations to follow it and establish joint business offices. Using the collective strength of the transportation industry to coordinate with Japanese transportation companies, they will jointly operate transportation services. The outline is as follows:</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>(1) To promote water and land transport business in Central China with companies such as China Merchant Steam Navigation, Central China Railway, Central China Transportation, and Inland River Shipping; (2) To improve inter-regional transportation services and enable rational development; (3) To reduce competition and friction among businesses and promote harmony and coordination; (4) To reduce unnecessary expenses among businesses and increase profits; (5) To coordinate with local Chinese transportation companies and firms to fairly and appropriately allocate business; (6) To represent local Chinese transportation companies and firms in external liaison.</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>(1) In the three special municipalities of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou, "members of various trade associations such as customs brokers, transshipment warehouses, truck and barge operators, stevedores, etc., should establish business offices based on their joint operations," and should also merge to establish a transportation industry joint office; (2) In other counties, cities, towns, and ports, members of various transportation trade associations should merge to establish a joint office, with one joint business office per locality as the principle; (3) Local joint business offices may establish a general office in Shanghai if necessary to handle liaison matters between joint business offices; (4) The location of each business office and joint office, the names of shareholders, the amount of subscribed capital, the names and resumes of directors, supervisors, general managers, and deputy general managers should be recorded in detail and reported to the local competent authorities for submission to the Ministry of Communications for registration.</p>
<p>Personnel</p>
<p>(1) Each office shall have 30 directors, who shall elect one chairman and two to six managing directors; (2) Each office shall have five supervisors, who shall elect two managing supervisors; (3) Each office shall have one general manager, and a deputy general manager may be appointed if necessary; (4) Other staff shall be determined separately.</p>
<p>Relationship</p>
<p>(1) After each office is established and reviewed by the Ministry of Communications and deemed qualified, it will be introduced to companies such as China Merchant Steam Navigation and Central China Transportation, which will recognize it as an agency (i.e., broker); (2) In addition to directly operating its main business, each office shall, in its capacity as an agency, solicit transportation business on behalf of companies such as China Merchant Steam Navigation and Central China Transportation; (3) Chinese companies and firms that have not joined the various transportation trade associations are not allowed to join the various business offices and joint business offices, nor are they allowed to directly request China Merchant Steam Navigation and Central China Transportation to obtain self-management agency qualifications.</p>
<p>Supplementary Provisions</p>
<p>(1) The business operations of each office shall be reported monthly to the local competent authorities for submission to the Ministry of Communications for record; (2) Each office shall be subject to the direction and supervision of the local competent authorities and shall be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications; (3) The transportation services and transportation companies and firms mentioned in this outline shall include customs declaration, transshipment trucks, barges, carriers, warehouses, insurance, trust, wharf loading and unloading, and other financing related to transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Controlled Transport and Controlled Oils - Annual Report of the Transportation Committee (Continued from the 14th) <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>On December 18th and 19th of the same year, this bureau also issued notices to purchase gasoline, fuel oil, diesel, and kerosene. Gasoline was priced at $5.20 per gallon, and the other three items were purchased at the original price paid to the oil companies by the respective owners. The transfer of kerosene was also restricted. On December 26th, a notice was published, ordering those who had oil in storage to report the reasons why their stored oil should not be purchased for critical use.</p>
<p>At the beginning of last year, this bureau conducted an investigation into the inventory of alcohol and the needs of normal users. On January 6th, a notice was issued to restrict the transfer of alcohol, etc. Subsequently, an investigation was conducted into the needs for fuel oil and diesel.</p>
<p>In March of last year, this bureau investigated the inventory and needs of mineral oil in the industrial sector, and the Controlled Transportation Committee, together with the Industrial and Social Affairs Bureau, organized the registration of industrial oil and crude oil. Fifteen registration forms were received. On March 30th, this bureau issued another notice, stating that from April 1st, the transfer of various mineral oils would not be permitted without a formal permit issued by the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>All unnecessary motorcycles and vehicles have been reduced. At the same time, a rationing system was implemented for the gasoline, kerosene, alcohol, crude oil, etc., needed by various bureaus within this bureau. This rationing method was implemented for public utility companies for several months. Alcohol was also supplied to the Health Department and major hospitals according to the rationed quantity. As for the gasoline needed by the post office and the courts, it was also rationed appropriately.</p>
<p>Controlled Transport</p>
<p>In December of the previous year, this bureau, recognizing that gasoline reserves were limited, immediately strictly restricted the use of motorcycles and vehicles to save gasoline. The use of motorcycles was limited to transporting a small number of citizens and transporting essential goods. Therefore, on December 9th of the same year, the transport of goods by motorcycle truck was prohibited, except for those who had obtained a transfer permit from the Price Control Committee. At the same time, the owners of motorcycle trucks were ordered to register their vehicles and gasoline supply with this bureau. On December 13th, the issuance of food transport permits was implemented, stipulating that motorcycle trucks were only allowed to transport rice, flour, and other grains. As for motorcycles, they were required to display a triangular permit to be allowed to operate; otherwise, their use was prohibited.</p>
<p>On December 18th of the same year, this bureau stipulated the maximum freight rate for transporting rice and flour, namely, $2 per bag of rice and 50 cents per bag of flour. On December 22nd, a notice was issued to organize a truck joint business office to transport essential goods at the prescribed freight rate. Later, recognizing that handcarts could replace trucks, the truck joint business office was deemed unnecessary.</p>
<p>On December 31st of the same year, this bureau issued a notice, ordering car owners with triangular permits not to use their vehicles for entertainment or private convenience. On January 5th of last year, a notice was issued to all car owners, stating that if vehicles were driven without a triangular permit, they would be confiscated upon discovery.</p>
<p>On October 8th of last year, this bureau published a notice, permitting taxis burning gasoline substitutes to operate within the boundary for essential uses. Regarding the number of licenses for such cars, the municipal authorities of the three districts consulted and agreed that this bureau would issue 200 licenses, and the French Concession Public Works Department and the municipal government would each issue 100 licenses.</p>
<p>The car triangular permits issued by this bureau were signed by the police department. The validity period was usually at most two months per term. Before each renewal, a joint committee organized by the municipal authorities of the three districts discussed and revised the methods to prevent malpractices and reduce all unnecessary military vehicles.</p>
<p>Fuel Supply</p>
<p>Given the shortage of gasoline supply, the search for substitutes was necessary. This was a technical problem that was extremely difficult to solve. The Controlled Transportation Committee established a subcommittee on December 17th of the previous year, named the Fuel Substitute Subcommittee. The members of the committee were all technical experts. Their task was to study substitutes for gasoline, diesel, etc., and to cooperate with similar committees of the French Concession Public Works Department to exchange ideas.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Shanghai Municipal Council Regular Budget Increases by Over 80 Million Yuan, Most Revenue Items are Underestimated to Prevent Potential Shortfalls in Taxes <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>(12) Sales Tax on Goods: The sales tax rate remains at 2% this year. The total annual revenue is estimated at 42,000,000 yuan. This figure is underestimated.</p>
<p>(13) Hotel and Restaurant Bill Tax: This item is estimated at 36,000,000 yuan for the current year, which is also underestimated. The tax rate remains at 10%, the same as last year.</p>
<p>(14) Telephone Tax: This item is listed as 4,428,000 yuan. There is no change in the tax rate.</p>
<p>(15) Stock Exchange Business Tax: This business tax is tentatively listed at 1,000 yuan this year, which is a nominal amount, as the scope of permitted stock exchange operations has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>(16) Miscellaneous Income: The source of this revenue is the sale of used goods and scrap metal. 1,435,000 yuan is tentatively listed for this year.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Summary of Various Regular Expenditures <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>(1) Fire Department: The Fire Department's expenses for this year are listed as 7,457,230 yuan, of which approximately 883,000 yuan is allocated for the replacement of old hoses.</p>
<p>(2) Police Department: The estimated expenses for all parts of the Police Department this year are estimated to total 100,481,750 yuan, an increase of 44,627,470 yuan over the previous year's budget. The increase in various office expenses is the main reason for the increase in this year's budget. The budget for all material needs has not been extravagant, especially for uniforms. The Council's policy of purchasing in advance has been beneficial to the budget. Although this year's uniform expenditure is estimated to be much higher than last year's budget, this is due to the sharp increase in expenses caused by staff changes and clothing replacements.</p>
<p>Due to the soaring prices of food, the expenses for food for prisoners in the Council's prisons and members of the Russian Auxiliary Team have increased significantly. The budget for prison food expenses was 4,729,620 yuan last year, but has increased to 6,715,050 yuan this year. As for the number of prisoners, it was listed as 7,680 last year, but is only calculated at 5,500 this year. Otherwise, the budget for food expenses would be even higher.</p>
<p>Since its establishment last year, the baojia organization has made significant contributions to assisting the police department in maintaining law and order. Its effects have been fully demonstrated. The draft budget for this organization has been revised. The revised amount includes the gradual advancement of the baojia system in the area north of Suzhou Creek and its expansion. However, future donations from citizens will not be included.</p>
<p>(3) Health Department: The estimated expenses for the Health Department this year are approximately 8,741,100 yuan, of which 4,179,020 yuan is for the non-hospital portion and 4,562,080 yuan is for the hospital portion. All expenditure budgets are for normal needs. However, under the hospital portion, a nominal expenditure of 500,000 yuan has been added to cope with outbreaks of epidemics and emergency measures.</p>
<p>(4) Allocations for Hospital Subsidies, etc.: This type of expenditure is listed as 1,994,000 yuan this year. The estimated deficits for the Hong'en and Gongji hospitals this year are 605,000 yuan, compared to 904,620 yuan last year. The reduction in the estimated deficit is partly due to the economic measures implemented by the two hospitals. The expenses for accommodating poor patients and people with mental illnesses and other diseases are estimated to be approximately 149,300 yuan higher this year than last year. The appropriation to non-Council hospitals is of a trial nature and is 420,510 yuan higher than last year. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e78">Fruitful Results Achieved at the First Meeting of the National Economic Committee - Impressions Shared by Advisor Kimura <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>On the 26th, the mainland _ paper reported that Dr. Kimura Zenta, advisor to the National Economic Committee and advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, had attended the first plenary meeting of the National Economic Committee in Beijing. Having completed his official duties and returned to Shanghai, he met with reporters at the _ Bank on the Bund at 3:00 PM on the 15th. He stated that the attending members from North and Central China were enthusiastic and reinforced the determination of the participating National Government to establish a wartime economic system and enhance production. This sincere attitude was admirable, and the meeting yielded many achievements. The following is a Q&amp;A between the reporter and Mr. Kimura:</p>
<p>Q: What about the proposals to promote the supply of materials?</p>
<p>A: There were many views put forward by the private sector regarding the purchase of rice, cotton, miscellaneous grains, etc. However, under the current conditions, the purchase of _ quantities of materials is quite difficult. Therefore, some people advocate not _ expecting the recovery of industry and the increase of production. The only way is to flow the materials from Shanghai to the mainland. If the _ operation is properly managed, I believe that the results will be good. In this case, the purchasing and allocation organizations must be systematically combined.</p>
<p>Q: What are the countermeasures to promote the purchase and increase production of materials?</p>
<p>A: Increasing agricultural products is the most urgent and necessary task. Various discussions have been put forward regarding this issue. The first condition is to improve the economic strength of rural areas. Otherwise, even if there are preparations for adjusting the purchasing mechanism, it will be futile if farmers have no funds to purchase agricultural tools and fertilizers. Therefore, when carrying out irrigation projects, consider rural lending at the same time. I heard that Huaxing Bank has _ carried out small-amount loans on a cooperative scale, and the results have been exceptionally good. The Central Reserve Bank, as the leader of the banking industry, also plans to mobilize Chinese, transportation, and other banks to actively prosper rural finance. However, financial institutions in the inland are not yet complete. Therefore, the Central Reserve Bank, commercial banks, money houses, silver firms, purchasing merchants, landlords, and farmer organizations are closely linked to the lending agency, which will have good results for the purchase of goods. However, this matter cannot be accomplished at once. Start with the _ range and consider establishing a specialized rural financial bank, but it has not yet materialized. Secondly, if we can start to eliminate water damage and improve irrigation, we can hope for a large increase in income.</p>
<p>Q: What is the content of the North China proposal?</p>
<p>A: There were no proposals in North China, only reports on finance, purchasing, and other issues. The price countermeasures in North China seem quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>Q: I heard that there was a discussion at this meeting on breaking the regional economy and unifying the national economy. How can the financial and exchange rate problems be solved?</p>
<p>A: There were no proposals on this issue. Breaking the regional economy requires a lot of preparation. If the small points of economic units are mixed together, it will be difficult to achieve good results. First, we must determine the source of the currency flow. Otherwise, it will be difficult to adjust trade issues.</p>
<p>Q: What is the purpose of Mr. Zai Shijing, the president of the China United Reserve Bank, coming to Shanghai?</p>
<p>A: According to what Mr. Zai said, he came only to inspect Shanghai. I conclude that after the above-mentioned problems are solved, the price of the Central Reserve Bank bonds can be maintained. Not only can it curb prices, but it can also increase production. Regarding the stability of currency, curbing prices, and increasing production, the preparations can be completed around March and April. In the future, the nature of the National Economic Committee will become more and more important, and the National Government and the Shanghai financial community are working together to solve various problems.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e79">The Future of China's Economic Realm <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>In the past, every major change in Shanghai's finances would inevitably affect the entire country and the global market, demonstrating the immense power of Shanghai's economy. For decades, Shanghai's economic activities have been closely connected with the world, interacting with markets in Europe, America, and Japan. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai's economic landscape has undergone a sudden shift, with all forces breaking away from the old norms and embarking on new paths. Old institutions are being destroyed to create new ones, old currencies are being replaced with new ones, old centers are being demolished to build new centers, and old exchange rates are being abolished to establish new ones. Therefore, the Shanghai economy after 1942 is completely different from the Shanghai economy before 1942, and the Shanghai economy of 1942 has become a special page in China's economic history.</p>
<p>Today's economic situation in Shanghai involves foreign exchange transitioning from British pounds and US dollars to military scrip, currency shifting from old legal tender to Central Reserve Bank notes, and the stock market moving from foreign stocks to Chinese stocks. Various banking and financial industries have also largely changed their content. In general, the wonderful history that has unfolded over the past decades is now being condensed into a single year, showcasing the full extent of volatility and unpredictability. In particular, the emerging industries are like bamboo shoots after a rain, dazzling and alarming, and the development of the times and the partial prosperity often leave people at a loss for words. Whether the future of Shanghai's economy brings disaster or fortune, good luck or bad luck, prosperity or decline, will be determined in this year. According to the reporter's view, fortune, good luck, and prosperity are all created by Shanghai's financiers and entrepreneurs themselves. And the responsibility for nurturing, protecting, developing, and growing lies with the government.</p>
<p>Now, the wartime economic policy guidelines have been formulated and announced by the National Government through the National Economic Commission. Our financiers and entrepreneurs should work together to increase industrial production in order to realize the planned production of the entire country. Not only should industries cooperate closely with each other, but industries and non-industries should also support each other. Furthermore, the sound development of trade associations and the promotion of the rationalization of production organizations are urgently needed. All disconnections between parties and organizational defects that have affected production efficiency in the past should be avoided. In particular, there should be no spirit of each acting independently, jealous of each other, and engaging in infighting. Everyone should eliminate personal interests, broaden their horizons, and truly recognize the important economic mission they should shoulder at present. Under the same goal of the entire country, everyone should contribute all their thoughts and strengths to the critical economic situation in China, making efforts to inherit the past and usher in the future. Perhaps there is hope for the Chinese economy to recover after reaching its lowest point?</p>

<p>2.  Breaking Down the Closed-Off Inland Economy</p>
<p>Currently, the most important issues in the Central China economy are, first and foremost, the price and currency unification issue (i.e., the full use of Central Reserve Bank notes). Indeed, thoroughly stabilizing prices and strengthening currency unification are the most important factors in the revival of the Central China economy. However, the root problems of the current Central China economy, or it can be said that the factors that must be solved, are the severance of trade with the three countries, the reduction in production, and the shortage of materials due to the poor circulation of goods in the inland areas. Stabilizing prices and consolidating the currency are also closely related to this. In the final analysis, without addressing the root causes, there is no way to treat the symptoms. Therefore, this article decides to focus on how to solve this problem in Central China now.</p>
<p>At present, Central China's industry, especially Shanghai's industry, which accounts for a large proportion of it, has seen a large decrease in production mainly due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the severance of foreign raw material sources, and the decrease in the import of inland materials. In order to overcome this difficulty, when foreign raw materials are hopeless, the prerequisite is only to break the closed-off phenomenon of the inland economy, so that inland raw materials such as cotton and wheat can be continuously transported to Shanghai and other industrial centers.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the closed-off nature of the inland economy, from the opposite point of view, the main reasons for the "isolation" of Shanghai are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Economic blockade against the enemy due to the necessity of war.</p>
<p>2.  A sharp reduction in the exchange ratio of materials due to the huge difference between the prices of industrial products and agricultural products: In other words, due to the soaring prices of urban industrial products, the purchasing power of rural areas has been reduced, so the supply of agricultural products has stagnated.</p>
<p>3.  The imperfection of the inland native product material purchasing institutions.</p>
<p>The first point regarding the economic blockade against the enemy, with Shanghai and Hong Kong already occupied by the Japanese army, has lost its necessity, so it is gradually being cancelled. However, the second type of price difference between the two, which has become the biggest reason today, has become very difficult to narrow. Last July, the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Stabilizing Prices and the Regulations on Combating Illegal Price Increases, and then carried out the so-called implementation methods for the main commodities, banned the pledge loans of commodities by silver and money industries, etc., so it spared no effort in racking their brains to stabilize prices. These relief programs have generally become a very effective restraint on soaring prices, which is also a fact. However, lowering the current soaring prices of industrial products is certainly not an easy task, and at the same time, raising the prices of agricultural products is not the best policy that is desired. If this is the case, to solve the problem, perhaps we can only expect the current third type of complete purchasing organization, and then slowly move towards overcoming the price disparity between the second type.</p>
<p>Originally, the purchasing institutions for native products such as rice, wheat, and cotton were produced by the local grain collection of the combat troops, and then developed into the purchasing institutions for the supply of materials to the Japanese army. This kind of purchasing institution is only an institution for maintaining the local life of the army, which obviously has non-economic characteristics, and is also a natural phenomenon. Later, the National Government was established, and the purchasing institution was handed over to the people, so this institution naturally changed. However, according to the Nanjing special telegram (January 4th Asahi Shimbun), it is said that its main purpose has the following defects:</p>
<p>1.  From the perspective of the transitional institution, it has developed into a monopolistic institution for Japanese merchants, centered on rapidly collecting materials to maintain the electric team.</p>
<p>2.  Moreover, Japanese trading companies, which were established to counter Chongqing's economic blockade and enemy trading companies, have a tendency to despise the Chinese side's traditional commercial institutions, resulting in a reduction in purchasing efficiency.</p>
<p>3.  The monopolistic institution is used as a liberal-minded organ, and its activity base becomes profitable and exclusive, and it even abuses the privileges granted by the authorities and strives for profit.</p>
<p>4.  As a result, the purchasing price of the above-mentioned purchasing institution is very low, resulting in the recent poor purchasing results, because farmers are willing to sell to local factories at high prices, and are also gradually inclined to homemade handicrafts such as cotton cloth, cigarettes, and candles.</p>
<p>5.  In addition, due to the imperfection of the distribution institution, there are also considerable defects in the distribution of indispensable daily necessities and production tools to the rural areas where native products are purchased, and the purchasing institution lacks organic ties.</p>
<p>If this is really the case, we must first (A) suppress the improper profits of the Japanese merchant monopolistic institution and rationalize the purchase price. (B) Cancel the exclusive sectarianism and cooperate with Chinese commercial institutions to the greatest extent. If the current two can be done, it can also be predicted that inland materials can provide a considerable amount. With this, the productivity of Shanghai's industry will also increase. In this way, it may be possible to supply inland rural areas with low-priced necessities, thereby exchanging for inland materials. This is the case in theory, of course, in practice, it cannot be so simple to take effect. In short, if you want to break the closed-off phenomenon of the inland areas to increase the productivity of Central China, you must take urgent measures to transform the character of the national monopolistic institution and strengthen joint ventures.

<p>February 14th, Lisbon Allied Press Telegram: The Chongqing Municipal Government, in view of the fact that flatbread merchants have recently reduced the area and weight of flatbread in order to take advantage of the food price limits and then sell it at the price limited by the authorities to seek profits, is now planning to first stipulate the area and weight of flatbread, and then limit the price.</p>
<h3 id="e82">An Analysis of Shanghai Money Shops <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the establishment of Shanghai money shops has increased like bamboo shoots after a rain. Their capital ranges from millions to only tens of thousands. Due to the size of their capital, the scope of their business operations also varies, and there are several different names. In general, they can be divided into five types, which are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Remittance Shops - Remittance shops are money shops that have joined the Money Industry Association, so they are also called "Yuan" money shops. Their capital is the largest among money shops, and their strength is strong. They have the right to directly participate in the remittance of bills. The ordinary so-called money shops generally refer to this type.</p>
<p>(2) Yuan Character Shops - Yuan Character Shops are money shops that are second to remittance shops. Their capital and business scope are smaller than remittance shops. In the past, in the era of paper money, silver and money were collected and transported by the stackers, so they were called "carrying" money shops. Because they cannot participate in the remittance of bills by the Money Industry Association, they entrust remittance shops to act as agents for the collection and remittance of bills.</p>
<p>(3) Heng Character Shops - The capital and business scope of Heng Character Shops are worse than Yuan Character Shops. After business hours, the silver and money that should be collected and transported are completed during the day, so there is nothing to do at night and they rest. People call them "closed-door carrying" shops.</p>
<p>(4) Li Character Shops - The business of Li Character Shops is different from the above three types of money shops. They do not engage in deposit pawns and loans, nor do they engage in bank subsidiary business. Their transactions are only the exchange of foreign currencies, etc., and the conversion of auxiliary coins. Recently, because the prices of foreign currencies such as Japanese military scrip have been fixed, this type of money shop has closed down and decreased.</p>
<p>(5) Zhen Character Shops - Zhen Character Shops have various names such as "cigarette paper money shops" and "small change shops." Their main business is the exchange of auxiliary coins and the operation of cigarette and grocery sales. This type of money shop is lined up in the streets, and we can see them everywhere.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that remittance shops are the main body of money shops, and Yuan and Heng money shops assist them. Their business is roughly the same as that of banks, because their operators are: (A) various deposits (B) various loans (C) pawns (D) discounting of promissory notes (E) warehousing (F) remittances, etc.</p>
<p>Since their business is similar to that of banks, why not directly change their name to bank? The answer to this question can be divided into the following points.</p>
<p>(1) Long history; before there were banks, they held the economic reins of major commercial ports. Because of their outstanding credit, there is no need to change their name.</p>
<p>(2) Although the money shop industry has recently been ordered by the Ministry to reorganize into limited companies, in the past, most of the money shops in our country were organized as partnerships, so the partners have joint and unlimited liability, which is the reason for their outstanding credit, and there is no need to change their name to bank.</p>
<p>(3) The industrial and commercial circles in our country have always been conservative, and the old-fashioned or semi-new-fashioned industrial and commercial enterprises that occupy the majority in various parts of our country are happy to deal with money shops. Moreover, the "Yuan" qualifications and procedures of remittance shops are quite strict, so their financial resources and reputation are extremely strong. They can gain the support of the industrial and commercial circles, and avoid losing the heroic posture of "Yuan." Why change?</p>
<p>(4) The loss and procedures for the money shop's tickets are quite strict, and there are very few forged signatures of money shop tickets in the past, so the recipients can avoid being deceived by the original person who requested the money shop to issue the ticket. Even if the issuing money shop unfortunately closes down, it must give priority to the holders of the money shop tickets. Therefore, the business of the money shop is busy, and it relies heavily on the money shop tickets. Since the money shop tickets are not easy to change their name, the money shop does not need to change its name to a bank.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that money shops have an irreplaceable superior position in today's financial circles. However, there are many newly established money shops recently. It is hoped that they will adhere to the original purpose of the money shops, adjust the financial situation for the society, and strive to serve, then their original heroic posture will not be slightly reduced, and they will still make a great contribution to the society.

<p>Canned mandarin oranges, the price was originally very low, but due to the scarcity of inventory and no domestic products, the market has been strong for a long time. Recently, because fresh oranges are expensive, many people have changed to eating canned ones, resulting in strong sales and rising prices. Recently, a box of two dozen 30-ounce cans is sold for 370 yuan. A box of four dozen 11-ounce cans is 335 yuan. The former has risen by 10 yuan compared with the beginning of the month, while the latter has risen by 15 yuan. A large number of boxes are still not easy to collect. The popularity of the market is rare. According to the two dozen cans, each can of oranges weighs 20 ounces net; the allocation price of the fourth phase of the association is 239 yuan and 30 cents. Each of the four dozen cans weighs 7 ounces net, and the allocation price of the first phase of the association is 196 yuan. The difference in selling price is as high as more than 60% to more than 70%. (Hua An) (Donation for Poverty Relief)</p>

<h3 id="e92">Stock Market Gossip <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Since the Chinese stock market opened red after the Lunar New Year, most retailers sold, resulting in a slight weakening of market prices. However, in the past week, many new large investors have emerged, and the prices of various stocks have risen in unison. The intraday jumps of public utility stock Zhabei Hydropower are the most noteworthy. Other stocks such as Mei Ah, Nanyang, Commercial Press, China Electric, Amoy, Guanshengyuan, etc. have also risen nearly one time compared to their lowest prices a month ago.</p>
<p>It is rumored that the unexpected surge of public utility stocks this time is due to several large investors pouring their efforts into buying in, including certain industry association organizations.</p>
<p>There are probably more than one or two stocks that are speculative and blindly rising. Investors should be wary and beware of setbacks.</p>
<p>The two tobacco industry stocks and the two food industry stocks, although they have risen sharply, still seem to have potential. Hanyeping Coal and Iron Mining stocks have recently attracted the attention of buyers.</p>
<p>The leaps of public utilities, cultural industries, food industries, department store stocks, etc. are reflecting the tranquility of the new pharmaceutical industry. At present, only Zhongfa has risen slightly among the new pharmaceutical industry stocks, while New Asia and other stocks seem to be more stable, but the foundation is very solid.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Sowing and Harvesting <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Yang</p>
<p>If you want to harvest, you have to sow. Once you sow, you will harvest. This simple and obvious cause-and-effect relationship is clear to everyone.</p>
<p>"If you want to harvest, you have to sow." This can be said to be an unbreakable law that no one can deny. Only with "spring plowing" and "summer weeding" can there be "autumn harvest" and "winter storage." To say that golden, fat grains emerge out of thin air from the cracks in the soil, watching the wheat and barley ripen while lying on the field ridges, is truly the height of absurdity!</p>
<p>"Once you sow, you will harvest." It cannot be stubbornly said that there are no exceptions, because once the seeds are sown in the soil, it depends on whether the temperature, moisture, and nutrients are suitable for them to grow. Sometimes you may encounter sowing without harvesting, but from the general situation, at least ten seeds should germinate out of a hundred seeds sown, and it will not be a complete waste, right?</p>
<p>Although the relationship between sowing and harvesting is very simple, it is still wrongly estimated and vaguely understood by many people. Why? I think it is because there is a necessary journey from sowing to harvesting, and many people have become lost sheep on this journey. What is this journey? - It is cultivation.</p>
<p>Some people say "just ask about cultivation," which is too blindly following. They cultivate green grass while sweating profusely. People say they are "putting in effort without getting any benefit," and they may even praise themselves for their "just ask about it" spirit. There are also people who "pull up the seedlings to help them grow," thinking that they are taking a shortcut, but they never expected that the seedlings after being pulled up would soon wither.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that you should choose the seeds before sowing, and control the harvest before receiving it. And what connects sowing and harvesting is a period of perseverance, patience, and correct cultivation.</p>
<h3 id="e94">The Disciplining of Life <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Heart One</p>
<p>Life needs discipline, because a disciplined life can keep your spirit from being listless, and can eliminate the bad habit of "changing one's mind frequently," so indirectly and directly it can also improve work efficiency. Because work efficiency increases, your spirit will certainly feel happy, so you can also have a greater sense of "self-confidence." Moreover, it can also train your ability to control things, properly vent your surplus energy, and enable life to develop in a healthy way.</p>
<p>A disciplined life is serious, creative, and enterprising. "Youth" is an enterprising period, and it is also a creative period, so a disciplined life is in greater and more urgent need for young people.</p>
<p>The disciplining of life, at first glance, seems "unnatural" and "stereotyped." But you should cultivate it with the word "perseverance," because although at first, you will feel a lot of inconvenience and pain, but after you get used to it, you will definitely find that it is vibrant and free.</p>
<p>People who waste away in listless extravagance, if they can make their lives serious, I can guarantee that they will definitely find meaningful and valuable life interests.</p>
<h3 id="e95">### Second Place in the January Essay Competition <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Feiqiong</p>
<p>My Life</p>
<p>Past:</p>
<p>The past life, like a comedy, has finished playing on the stage. I remember that from childhood to adolescence, my family was very wealthy, and I was willing to study hard, so I felt very proud and arrogant, because many people, although they worked hard, were not wealthy, and those who were wealthy were unwilling to work hard, but I had both: I had a suitable environment, and I also had the ambition to improve myself: whenever there was a major exam in school, my grades were always among the best, and never fell below 85 points. At that time, not only did parents praise me, but all relatives and friends knew about it. As for daily life, we lived in a tall Western-style house on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai, with a private car, motorcycle, electric stove, electric fan, and radio. In Suzhou, we had a self-built three-story building, with vermilion doors, a spacious living room, and redwood furniture inlaid with marble all around. The living room led to a study on both sides, which contained famous Chinese and Western paintings and books from ancient and modern times. It was truly dazzling, with no less than tens of thousands of volumes. Along the east wall of the study was a garden with peach and plum blossoms in full bloom, with pavilions, terraces, buildings, towers, fish ponds, flower beds, cedars, and rockeries, which were indeed breathtaking. As for food, not only was there fish and meat on the table every day, but also chickens and ducks were constantly available. Since the outbreak of the war, the family fled to the countryside. Unfortunately, in the countryside, my grandmother, uncle, and uncle all died one after another due to acclimatization and shock. At the same time, everything in the family was either destroyed in the war zone or stolen by thieves. In great difficulties, we came to Shanghai. Besides my father, who was the greatest pillar of our lives, the rest were a group of ten children who were still wet behind the ears.</p>
<p>Present Situation:</p>
<p>When we returned to Shanghai, this home was gradually established by my father again single-handedly. Under the circumstances of this rapidly advancing standard of living, we were able to save and economize and maintain the opportunity to study. Speaking of clothing, food, housing, and transportation: although it is not extremely difficult, it is not abundant either. In the past four or five years, I have not added a single expensive or gorgeous piece of clothing, or silk or satin. The clothes I wear with me or when I go out are not only made of coarse cloth, but are also old-fashioned ones that I have altered myself. Speaking of decoration: I have not visited a barbershop in three or four years. When my hair gets long, I ask my mother or myself to trim it in front of the mirror. As for perms, I have never tried them in my life. Although the desire to be beautiful is common to everyone, and I am not a person with a pockmarked face or disabilities, why is my temperament so strange that I am unwilling to follow the crowd? Of course, young people should always advance with the times, but some trends are not beneficial to us or worthy of imitation, especially since I live in such an era. I feel that decoration is a waste of time and money, and it is not allowed or possible for us to throw away my father's hard-earned money for vanity. Secondly, regarding food: in the morning, I only have a thin slice of two-ounce bread to fill my stomach, no sweet potatoes, let alone thin porridge. Especially in the past two months, I have been using brown rice or broken rice and flour as my lunch and dinner every day, and I have not had the chance to eat white rice. We often eat steamed fish, steamed vegetables, and fried leftover rice because of the lack of oil. I don't feel any pain about these things. I just feel strange that things I had never experienced before are now passing by peacefully. Although these real situations and scenes fill my heart and will be remembered forever, I still try my best to tolerate and accept them. Next, talking about transportation: every time I go to school or return home, whether it is heavy rain, heavy snow, or a storm, I walk instead of taking a car, unless it is a very urgent matter, but it is limited to streetcars.</p>
<p>Adaptation:</p>
<p>An ancient saying goes: "The times create heroes," but heroes must also transform the times. Although I don't have such great ability and ambition, I should at least have the ability to deal with the environment. In this turbulent and precarious world, survival is indeed very difficult. If you are not careful, you may be squeezed out or rolled out of this world, so you must have a kind of life skill to cope with the environment. When I was three years old, my mother passed away. Since then, no one has ever told me about the infinite changes in worldly affairs and human relationships, and the proper attitude to deal with people and things. Although I have seen some of these things in books, they are not practical experiences, but merely theoretical and empty words. As a result, all household affairs are now managed by me, because my brothers have gone out to take care of their own futures, and my mother has taken three younger siblings back to her hometown. There are only six people left in the family. Except for my father, who leaves early and returns late, the rest are me and my cousin, brother, and sister. Speaking of their temperaments, they are very different. Moreover, we have been used to teasing each other since childhood. Now that I am suddenly in charge of the household, I feel very difficult. If I am too strict, I will definitely cause resentment. If I am too lenient, not only will household affairs not be taken care of, but there will be quarrels and fights all day long, which is simply unbearable. Therefore, on the one hand, I take care of washing, cleaning, and sewing my own clothes, rooms, and shoes and socks. If I have extra time, I help my cousin and cousin organize other tasks. If it happens to be a holiday, I go to buy groceries, wash rice, or cook. In short, I want to set an example so that they know how to understand. My management of everything is not based on a commanding position, but on the responsibility of guiding. No matter what happens, we must work together so that they know that they have self-esteem and a sense of responsibility. Even if they have made mistakes, I also give them the opportunity to correct them, implying that I know about their mistakes, but it is out of forgiveness. At the same time, regarding the daily meals, of course, it is best to live within our means, but many things happen that cannot be predicted. Therefore, on the one hand, I prevent them from being affected by the poor ingredients of the meals and affecting their nutrition. On the other hand, I also limit the amount of food and drink to avoid unnecessary waste. Next, speaking of myself, in addition to going to school for classes and returning home to take care of household affairs, I also need to do further studies and reading. Books are very expensive now, but how can I continue my studies without books? As the saying goes, "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." Especially when studying at university, you must spend most of your time on self-study and reading widely. Therefore, no matter what the situation, I go to two large libraries every week to browse various reference books, and then borrow a few useful books home and take notes on them in my spare time. Again, talking about the preparation of tuition fees, when we finish a major exam, we often see our father frowning, because under this high standard of living, it is not easy to support a family of twelve without borrowing money, let alone at this time, when a huge amount of tuition fees needs to be paid! Therefore, I feel that studying is not a happy thing, especially as the years go by, using the tuition fees paid by my father's hard work, I feel that my responsibility is even greater, and my inner joy is even more diminished. How can I not want to exchange work for some remuneration, but in this world where there are more people than jobs, where is your foothold? My only remedy from now on is to continue to maintain my previous frugality, save all the wasted money for the purchase of books and stationery, etc., so that I can slightly reduce my father's burden on tuition fees, and at the same time manage the household affairs in an orderly manner, so that my father will not feel unhappy when he sees the chaotic situation after returning late.</p>
<p>Hope:</p>
<p>Let the past be the past. I know that the future days may not be better than the present, unless it is a sudden change. My life does not hope to have any luxurious or extravagant enjoyment or decoration. I only hope to cultivate my body and mind and educate myself in a difficult life. How many great figures in history, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, did not grow up and succeed in hardship? Only when they can use old experiences to gain new experiences can they create a good new environment. Therefore, I need and can use the experiences in pain to temper my body and mind, and not let the pain of the environment dominate my body and mind.

<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>"Some of you who were here before the war will surely remember that German teacher, Max Steffel. When the war broke out, he was visiting his family in Germany. He was very popular here, and had many friends. Last week, he died on the Western Front. Those who knew him must feel very sorry."</p>
<p>After he sat down, his face was a little pale. He knew he had done something unusual. But he had not discussed the matter with anyone beforehand: no one could be blamed. After a while, outside the chapel, he heard a debate:</p>
<p>"Gipps said, on the Western Front. Does that mean he was fighting for the Germans?"</p>
<p>"I think that's right."</p>
<p>"Then it seems a bit odd to read his name out along with the others. After all, he was an 'enemy'."</p>
<p>"Oh, I think that's just one of Gipps' ideas. The old boy has a lot of ideas."</p>
<p>Gipps, back in his own room, was not troubled by this criticism. Yes, he had a lot of ideas - dignified and generous ideas that were gradually dwindling in this crazy world. And he thought: Brookfield will get them from me: but they won't get them from anyone else.</p>
<p>Once, someone asked him for his opinion on bayonet practice, which was taking place near the squash court. He replied in that languid, slightly wheezing tone, which was often excessively imitated, he said: "The thing seems to me - er - a very vulgar method of homicide."</p>
<p>This was passed around and welcomed - how Gipps had told the big-hatted officer from the War Office that bayonet fighting was vulgar. Just like Gipps. They had found him an adjective - an adjective just coming into use: he was Pre-War (38). Community Service</p>
