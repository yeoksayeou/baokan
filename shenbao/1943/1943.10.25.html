<h3 id="c1">敎職員增加待遇雜感 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>前昨兩天報載關於小學敎職員待遇問題的兩段消息，其一，是本市各市立小學敎職員赴市財政局請願。因爲敎職員前以待遇過低，無法維持生活，曾推派代表分向市府及敎育屆請求增加生活費，尙無結果。特再向財政局請願，當山財政局長對於所提請求原則上接受，惟未會同敎育局作精密之核算以前，無法答復，但可負資者，市立小學敎職員之待遇，決當使之較高於私立小學敎職員之平均數，以求合理。其二，是本市私立學校敎職員補助金將開始核發。因為市政府鑒於私立學校敎職員之淸苦，循市敎育會之請求，允予每月　助五十萬元。惟該款來源，係由市政府商得財政部稅務署之同意，從該署撥付市政府協助徵收費項下支付，原定自八月份開始，但市財政局與稅務署接洽結果，稅務表僅能於五月份籌措三十萬元，十月至十二月每月籌足五十萬元。第一批補助金計九十月份合計八十萬元，已由市教育會向財政局具領。至如何支配，早經敎育會召集各區敎育會代表組織保管支配委員會，議決各種分配原則及請領辦法，手續力求簡單週密，並定期本月二十七日起開始分發。</p>
<p>我們細細的讀了這兩段消息，發生如下的感謝以及　干期待：</p>
<p>敎職員爲人師表，是多麼神神聖的職業；作育人材，是多麼重大的使命。以如此神聖的職業，負如此重大的使命，而所以受待遇，竟無法維持生活，　然間似乎令人不能相信，而畢竟鐵一般的事實。這種事實的存在與擴展，無疑會影響　資人材的凋零與師資素質的减低，直接影響於國民敎育的發展；間接就影響於建國人材的　養的培養、</p>
<p>我國敎育不普及的程度，在現代國家中百分比佔最大多數，文盲之多，誠到處皆是，尤以學齡兒童的失學爲最嚴重，國家復興與社會改善的責任，如何可以寄托於文盲　上？那末推廣國民敎育，掃除文盲，即爲國家敎育方針之基本，因此，對於師資之需要，不言而喻，奈何薄予師資之待遇如彼，而苛責應盡師資之責任者又如此呢？</p>
<p>木市私立學校敎職員由市府給予生活補助，雖有杯水車薪之感，但當局注意及此，實施補助，巳屬難能。不過，在旣已尤諾之每月五十萬元，自八月份開始者，而今延展一月，並少支二十萬元，不免美中不足。至於稅務署與市府之間，誰應負付足之責，我們就敎職負立塲，未便亦不必辨別，因爲彼此都是公款，殊無追問之權。我們願代敎職員祈求市府與稅務署的幫忙，付足至預約之數。</p>
<p>市立小學敎職員待遇，原則上應以合乎生活標準爲根據，而不必以一使之較高於私立小學敎職員之平均數「爲依據。因爲市立私立雖有不同，而敎職員需要生活却完全相同。市立私立學校敎職員的資歷容有嚴寬的形式，但彼此的待遇上不必形成公式的鴻溝。我們盼望市立學校敎職員要求提高待遇時，陳述無法維持生活的理由巳足，不必以私立舉校敎職員有補助爲比較的理由·同時，我們盼望敎育與財政當局及早「作精密之核算」，即予公布，俾市立學校敎職員及早安心工作。</p>
<p>其次，小學敎職員待遇，希望逐漸改善以外，我們對於同樣負有重大使命而同樣清苦的文化人，尤其是絞腦汁賴稿費生活的文化人，也値得當局和有關方面的垂　·排字工資巳到了每千字七八十元的階段，而文人稿費尙有滯留在二三十元者，很少時代創作，精心傑構的巨著，非無原因吧？</p>

<p>福啞學校的誕生雖稍遲，但在上海却很快獲得重要的地位。</p>
<p>雙啞兒童的教育，比普通敎育更需要完善的體備，以補教員口請指盡之不足及不能。汪校長談起該校過去的設備，仍有不勝感慨之情。原來附設在虹橋路盲童學校的時期，一切雙啞教育上的設備，雖不能說是「應有盡有」然而對於六十至八于名學生所需要的，也勉强可以足用了。常時險了普通學科之外，還特設有工藝等科，使學生各有專門技能可習，為將來謀生準備不幸在戰事中全部損失了。後來搬到白利南路B三十七號，雖然設備不能不因陋就簡，但是環境還是很好。當時曾開課室九處。還有圖書館，禮堂，膳堂，運動塲，籃球及足球塲，以及建築得非常　究的男女生宿舍。現在只成爲壯美的回情了。</p>
<p>黃家沙路三十三號新校址是一所獨立的花關洋房，共有三層十七間，被分劃成五個教室，其他辦公窒，膳意，遊息室等各一間，男女生及幼年生宿舍五間，分佈在二及三樓，佈置得相當整齊。據說宿舍另有保姆負責看護審宿生的日常生活，特別注意清潔衛生，同時在教育方面也隨時鼓勵學生自動注重清潔工作。其他洗濯室，浴室，廚房，廁所等雖皆簡陋，但是由於管理得宜，都可與什麼大學校媲美。而校　與操塲等也算　備，所以環境可說是適宜於雙啞敎育事業的。編制方面，據汪校長說，現仍分預科二年，初級小學四年，高級小學二年，初中職業科三年，附設師範講習科等。凡年在七歲至十四歲的男女聾啞兒童，家道清白者，都可以入學，其入學手續，須先期報名，由家長填具入學志願書，經審查　取後，當即通知，正式入學。這一學期微收學費三百四十元，什費六十元，宿費二百元，　長每月約繳五百元。不過實際上免費及半費的人數也不少。本學期學生計有六十二人，男生四十五人，女生十七人，住校學生十九人，其中有十二名為難童。學生全部為聾啞兒童，但少數已能發出簡單的字音了。</p>
<p>敎學一瞥</p>
<p>現在的校舍可也不差哪，進門一個不大但也算不得大小的校　，沿着竹籬笆，栽植着花草。成　　市中國雅的所在，應　室裏，聾啞學生的成績，壁上的水彩畫，人像　、玻璃櫥裏的工藝品，都給人以良好的印象。　接宇貼壁的一間。是預科的課室，一位聲啞的女教員在用手式和別的方法教導十多個聾啞孩子，看她忙碌緊張的情形，可見比教青普通孩子是辛苦得多了。據汪校長說。預科規定為二年，約等於普通的幼稚　，期滿後升入初級小學</p>
<p>二樓三　教室，一二年級合佔一室。每級各有一位女敎師在分別敎授一年級在學習發音，教師隨便指出一二個女生來誦讀簡單的課文，居然都能發出　近似的國音，啞子不啞，決不是理想了。二年級在沙書，一　不很短的文章，每一個學生都抄　相當整齊，而書法也都淸秀正確，看不出是低年級　童所寫的、三·四年級　有兩位先生在教導，學生的年齡比較大些，教學都混用手語。五·六年級合佔一個教室，由一位教師實行分組教授。每組五六人·與教師一同圍坐在一只桌子旁邊，各人都有自己的課本，桌上有一塊小黑板，先生逐字逐句的用手式和筆談解釋，學生都用心地學習着。當這一組由教師教導時，另一組即行自修。教師却忙得透不過氣來了。</p>
<p>現在上海福啞學校的主要學科是：公民·發音·視話·手勢·國語·尺　·筆談·日文·英文·常識·筆算·珠算·史地·衛生·藝術·體育·習字等等。其中藝術科包括國畫·太炭畫·粉畫·水彩畫·用器畫等。</p>
<p>啞學校附設的師範　習科、分　初兩級，目的在養成聾啞專門教育的師賀、以應社會需要，凡高中畢業或師範畢業者科　入高級講習科、條　期一年。注重實習。初中，業及同等學力者得入初級講習科，修業期兩年畢畢與實習並重、</p>
<p>除了普通學科之外，原設有初中職業科，規定二年畢業，敎授藝術、中文打字、機械　級及刺　等等。現在因為校舍比較狹小，校具設　不甚完普，所以未能舉辦，如果社會上熱心人士能夠給與協助的話，注校長却表示決心在最短期內恢復起來。</p>
<p>汪校長極鄭重地說明該校不僅注力於學科，同時更盡力於聾啞兒童良好品德之陶冶，因為聾啞兒童靑年，頭腦此較簡單，感染最易，所以必須由教師以身作則，同學互相誡勉，造成優美的學風，養成品德健全的國民。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3 id="c33">建部之建設公債 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>據最近報章露佈，建設部為促進三年計劃起見，將發行相當敎額的建般公債，以資應付，其所預訂的三年計劃，是分做三部份的，就是水利·交通，和都市建設；在水利方面、決定先疏　東太湖，並開關東太湖沿岸的荒地，同時並開掘蘇北新運河；在交通方面，決定先開關新公路，以便利戰時運輸；在都市建設方面，也決定按步就班逐步進行都市方面之建設。</p>
<p>當此世界各國相率競曹五年計劃，十年計劃之秋，三年計劃並不能認為過份誇大、但其需費的浩大、說起來識恐相當的驚人。有人感覺為使建信發行數額不至過份龐大起見，對於都布建設部份，似乎可以縮小範圍，甚至暫行放棄，因為現階段的人們，感覺都市較有保障，故相率擁往都市去居住、設令都市必須於此時再加以建設，不是更要鼓勵人口之　中於邵市嗎？因此、較多甚至全部的時間，經費與人力，似應用對於水利與交通之建設，因為一則有助於農業的增產，一則有助於物資的交流。建設就是生產，生產所是建設，建設公債發行的最終目標，還是在於　　　　戰時的生產，自囑亳無疑義。</p>
<p>此外，建部將來所發鉅額公實，似宜先由人民消化，藉以吸收人民手中的剩餘購買力，不宜先由發行銀行承購，以免通貨增發，刺激物價上漲的流弊。</p>

<p>東京日十四日中央社電　此間軍事專家談太平洋戰況稱：自去年八月一上旬、美軍在所羅門　島開始反攻以來，太平洋戰綫即轉入一新局面，自是以來已一年另三月，日·美兩軍均舉陸海空三軍之全力陸續展開激烈之決戰，日軍前為</p>
<p>應付戰局之變動，於本年二月上旬自瓜　康納爾島撒退後，即改變戰略方針，對敵之攻勢採取防守勢，到處殲滅來攻之敵軍，此種戰術謂之「田血作戰」·收效頗宏。　日軍自瓜灣康納爾島撤退後，繼於十月上旬再由可倫班加拉及培拉拉培拉島撤退。又新幾內亞戰綫自日軍由浦那撤退以來，薩拉摩亞與拉埃戰綫、亦拯次向北推移。刻日·美兩軍正在芬希哈罕北方地區展開激戰中。日軍於撤退作戰中所獲戰果極大，力月十三日發行之美國經濟雜誌亦曾謂：「最近太平洋攻擊作戰，已證明美軍一一反攻各島嶼·不僅緩慢，且需有莫大犧牲」。足證日軍所取之新戰術已被敵方　擾不堪，蓋因日軍之出血戰術，為日軍發動攻勢以前之唯一作戰方式，大東亞戰爭中、日軍必須經過下述</p>

<p>永垂戰史該　土　僅佔二千平方哩，浦那又為邊隅一都邑而已，但日軍在此兩地實施撤退作戰以前，已牽制敵軍約有半年之久，且在此期間中，日方之犧牲傷亡僅一萬六千七百三十四人、飛機之自炸及未返者計百三十九榮。反　敵美澳軍所受損害　大，計傷亡二萬五千餘人，飛機之被擊落擊破者二百三十架、大砲破壞三十門以上，戰車被毀二十五輛。又敵美軍於去年六月底　倫特巴島登陸、以迄十月上旬日軍由可倫班加拉島、培拉培拉島轉進爲止，約歷三個月間，敵軍所蒙損害在新佐治亞鳥附近約一萬一二千人，在倫特巴島約七百人，培拉拉培拉島附近約一千人，合計一萬五千人，又日軍准薩拉摩亞，拉埃地區，於</p>
<p>九月上旬開始逐漸轉進，于月中旬在拉埃北方地區集結完畢，其間日方戰死約二千人。敵之損害，估計有一萬二千人，若連同時期之海上作戰，由第一次所羅門海戰以迄可倫班加拉島洋面夜戰為止，過去一年間因南太平洋全城之海上激戰計算，日方之損害計沉失艦艇二十艘，被毀艦艇三十艘，船舶沉沒及被毀者各二十艘，飛機自炸及未飛返及受傷者共計七百架左右。敵方之損害計有戰艦，航空母艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦等敵艦被擊沉一百五十艘，擊被五十艘，船舶擊沉六十艘，華破二十艘，飛機被擊落三千架，其損害數字極為龐大，敵</p>

<p>在最困苦的生活中節省下來，用十塊錢的代價，我在巴黎看了苦幹演出的「聽」。</p>
<p>我是一個貧苦學生、因為申報助學金的幫助，才並跑進學府的高門標的，所以我對於看「驅」別有一種滋味，　着舞台上如火加茶的塲面，我的感動是雙重的，－一方面是劇情給我的激動·一方面是苦　的精神讓我所引起的反應。</p>
<p>舞合上所描寫的「　」，無論主題與形式，似乎都與原著不問了，與電影「亂世佳人」更去　遠，「諷」走的是另一修路。它描寫的是北伐時代年青的一　－　　潮流激邊下小　　階級的一羣，盲從的熱心家（如渴氏兄弟)，　、惟的幻想家（如查體）、投機主義的革命者(如甘佛嵐)都有了一個粗略的剪影，而作爲主角的衛西里和白瑞得，前者是小資產知識份子的典型，他們有着完美的品性，熱心革命然而不能作為一個戰士；後者雖然同情革命·自已却遠遠地站在一邊。做他飄飄然的冷嘲家－十足的個人主義者。如果我猜得不錯、我想，劇作者在「飄」表所要寫的主題祇是一點：就是小資產階級對於革命的幻　。這對於我們，是一個衛其親切的作品。</p>

<p>而這一次苦幹演出最重大的意義，就是對於助學運動的推進、對於一切則學金或貸學金、社會人士的熱心捐輪、固然是一種最可貴的舉動，但像苦幹與申報助學金這樣的合作，我覺得尤其值得贊同，因為這是積極的，意　也是雙黨的－－是戲劇還動，同時對助學運動也作了實際的推進。</p>

<p>— 樂其中</p>
<p>我是印刷所的一個排字工人，說來印刷所亦屬於文化事業之一，我雖被人稱為工人，却不能與一班販夫走卒的工人，所可混喻，因我的工作頗多省力，既不用肩負，又不用手扛，專用手腦眼力，所以資質須較為靈明，同時亦必須略知些外國文字。如英文，日文，德文等，尤是現今日文更為繁用。差不多每一張稿子都要需用的。說來我們亦是技術人員，因此種工作非局外人所能担任的。</p>
<p>說到我們生活待遇的苛刻，眞是低微至極，按月所得的工資僅三百元（連早點費在內）試問值此　物高漲之際，此區區的三百元工資作何應用呢，休說仰事俯習，且連個人的零用亦不夠。</p>

<p>自獎軍在納蘇灣登陸後，以拉埃（Tae）薩拉廳亞（Salamaua）爲主軸的新幾內亞戰綫戰況，即時刻增劇，連續展開了壯烈的決戰。截至昨日爲止的陣地上，到處有精潦成池的大　穴。邀擊携有優秀重火器的敵方陸上大軍，奮勇如　猊的勇士，其形相之壯烈無異神兵。許多受傷將十在野戰病院中略事包紮後，便又忽忽趕赴火綫。看到手足皆裏着滲透鮮血的辦帶，隻手并杖雙手持槍的士兵，以及手臂已受創傷而仍緊握軍刀不停指揮的將校，豈還不能稱這種奮戰，為壯烈嗎？所羅門羣島之戰着是」血戰」，那末，新幾亞戰綫當是「死鬥」，以下是柳田軍醫上尉所述：</p>
<p>踴躍赴戰</p>
<p>美軍在納蘇　登陸是六月三十日的事。為備敵方的大舉反攻，我方逐漸鞏固陣地。姆鮑方面兵力的單薄，最堪置念，增強該地的兵力，一刻不容猶豫。於是在敵方魚雷艇的跳梁跋扈中，用敢死的舟艇機動戰，將某部隊的主力派拌該方。誇稱精銳的某部隊主力、抵達目的地後，不遠稍息。即行進襲美軍據拈威　溢里。敵航空部隊得知後，即刻出動。「孔索裏」，「波因」等大型敵機，翱翔空際，宛如吸血的惡魔，紛紛投下重磅炸彈，並用機槍密集掃射，茲林內幾乎連一雙老鼠也不能容身。誇稱糧銳的某部隊主力，對此亦束手無策，因而預定計盡一點也不能實行。</p>
<p>衆寡懸殊</p>
<p>可是納蘇　的敵軍都不絕增援，在陸空呼應之下，反向某部隊猛烈反攻。該部隊將士在砲火連夭中，繼續阿修罷的死鬥、不惜以身報國。共堅强耐戰，於此可見。其後戰况日趨劇烈　壯，於是在某月某日下令縮短戰綫，退至薩拉摩亞附近的陣地，並鞏　海岸方面的陣地。敵軍的火力裝備頗為優秀，迫擊砲，重山砲不斷狂吼。不分晴雨明晦日夜，砲聲隆隆，彈下如雨。「不要錢的敵軍砲彈哪！」一個勇士脫口喊道。有道麼多的砲彈？眞使人佩服。甚至有時還有拔掉信管的砲彈送來。不炸裂的砲彈　通幕會的頂而落下來時，那才確實可怕啦！不過，敵軍不開砲則已，如果發總是將千古未經斧銊的菁菁業林，連根掘起，轟起了滿天赭土，厥景殊慘！</p>
<p>反之，友軍則因第一綫缺乏輸送力，彈藥糧秣皆無法接濟，所以決不虛發一彈。而且我方開砲一發，即可收到二三十發的答禮；如用迫　砲，他們便以野山砲酬答；如用野山砲，就有重砲囘敬。因此我們的砲兵部隊祇可以質取勝專賴數量的敵方砲兵，此可謂是一關魂之挑戰」。我方勇士射出的砲彈，每顆均含「一發減敵」之魂。甚至有以最後一門山砲一砲轟燬敵方迫　砲七門的事。當苦戰中的舅士們得然鈴　隊長指揮的砲兵增援部隊，必勝的意氣衝天，冒滔天駭浪、踴躍在薩拉摩亞登陸的消息，而在露營中夢見明日的戰關時，不料於大編隊的敵機猛炸之下，鈴木隊　以下的多數將士竟爲國犧牲了。以這些人員來發揮〇隊爲威力，畢竟是困難的，然而再求　充的兵力，又為現狀可不許，何况前綫需砲兵的助戰　如星火。因止，某某砲兵部隊長便下悲壯的決心。擬斷然暫時解散〇隊，分散配　於其他部隊，以期由此發揮砲兵的威力至最大限度。</p>
<p>以質勝量</p>
<p>當時向〇隊的生存者即向某某砲兵部隊長提出由四倉卯之助軍曹等若干名簽署的　願血書，其內容略謂：</p>
<p>「軍人旣臨戰塲，誰倚顧慮本身之激變耶？〇隊於目的地薩拉摩亞登陸後，人員器材皆無損失。並傳先行之〇隊接待，隊員士氣極盛，方期於明日之戰關中完途任務，焉如突遭敵機猛炸，不幸喪失〇隊長以下若干戰友。然為不負〇隊長平棄教訓，縱至最後一兵，亦當與火砲同命，故　〇〇名生存者乃以菊地少尉為核心，精誠團結，願為〇隊之榮譽作殊死關。〇隊即令僅剩火砲一門，亦必出岔　敵之任，以慰隊長及戰友之英靈，兼為皇國効忠。茲吾等止準備奉行明日之命令，尚希鑒　下情，不令第〇隊分散。」</p>
<p>手拿遵封血書的部隊長。看完後不禁嘆道：「余實未曾為部下之眞誠感動若此者！」一字一句均充滿忠烈的氣魄，其　切的衷情足　鬼神。遭離消還不能說是砲兵魂的精華嗎？正當地上第一綫部隊在敵軍大砲的猛轟下及敵軍機　的狂炸下，展開決死戰鬥時，突然加入助戰的便是神野部隊。神野部隊是在〇〇訓練有素的精銳，自在薩拉摩亞上陸以來，即神出鬼沒。舅猛果敢地斬入敵陣，擊潰敵眾，完如摧枯拉朽。他們的夜　和衝錄是非常有效的，因此他們曾對〇〇參謀長說、紙要食糧不斷，　　是無須担憂的。所以敵軍長之殊深。又，大塲教死隊亦曾深入敵陣，辛酸苦鬥，心　殘壞　方的砲兵陣地。</p>
<p>但　拉摩亞　　的反攻氣勢，日益露骨積極。遂望敵方陣地，天天可見道格拉斯運輸機用降落傘投下不知什麼長形的物件。究竟是什麼東西呢？這瞇在數日之後終於打破了。某日偶然從友軍機駕駛者那裏得悉，那些是中口徑四卞五種的高射機開槍。原來敵軍是用飛機運輸高射機關槍的！友軍陣地受敵方的砲擊轟炸，「井」和「池」的數目日增。沒在積水的戰壕中作戰的勇士，足上都患濕氣，其狀慘不忍覩，但他們皆抱必死的決心，全力奮戰，固守薩拉摩亞</p>
<p>月某日，數十名敵兵潛入高橋隊陣地的間隙，剛開始在那裏機築陣地時，立被宮井伍長發見。於是他馬上帶了六名部下，不顯性命地勇猛攻擊。敵兵一時倉皇不知所措陷於混亂，但見來者不衆，便又恢復鎮靜，用自動小槍應戰。宮井伍長常即單身殺入敵陣，縱檔馳騁。終於刀折矢盡而殉國。此外另有士兵一名戰死，三名受傷，結果僅剩福當兵長及天田上等兵二人。常敵軍恃眾反攻之間，太陽一已不知不覺落山了。福富兵長和天田上等兵遂藉夜色的蔭蔽，匍匐追近敵陣，一同丟擲手溜彈。　　中酣睡的敵兵不知虛實，帕時大亂，倉皇敗退。他們兩人便堅守陣地，直到翌晨增援隊開來，因此獲得長官的藵獎及記功。</p>
<p>攻擊精神</p>
<p>某月其日，美軍突在婆娑（Busu）河及霍浦伊（Hopoi）之間上際。是日上午九時起，無精電即發生故障，正在詫異時，到了十一點鑪光景，隆隆之聲　地，B二十四和B十七約三十餘架向拉埃仁空飛來。不久，敵機即用三架一隊的陣形，開始連鐵轟炸，以〇〇爲中心。轟炸之猛烈。實非　請斯　　容。炸彈是一秒乃至二秒的時限炸彈。都是五　公斤左右的大　東西。轟炸時由動地搖，山相亦瞬息為之一變。炸轟炸成的大穴，直徑約二十公尺，深達六·七公尺，像池一般　着水，這裏那裏，到處都是。</p>
<p>夜色轉白　，在　遠的海上發見由大望逾洋艦。驅逐　警戒着的輸送船　。並有浮出水面的潛水艇。上空有無數P三十八戰鬥機在飛翔。　船合計七十艘。遭　大輪船　，後被我方陣海軍飛機炸燬，計擊沉巡洋艦一。運輪船四－六，此外有驅逐　二艘重傷起火，P三十八戰鬥機亦　擊　二十七架。關於這次的大捷，已有大本營發表。</p>
<p>為預防敵方上　部隊的渡越動斯河，機關砲隊乃沿勃斯河布陣，嚴加戒備，如有敵來，不論何時均可將其擊潰。不到數天，被我　方的野砲，機關砲突然狂吼。全體將士弊極度緊張。因為無論怎樣　說，我方　是寡兵呀。於是迄今在野戰病院中　吟不絕的將士，聽到　聲後，也全體支撐起來，柱杖　槍的士兵，　臂　　的　皎，以及斷肢失態的戰友，都一致奪起。這樣的擊戰，誰曾見過呢？　　一口氣尚在，便力戰不展！且認戰死沙塲爲軍人無上的榮譽，還是何　崇高的精神！這也就是攻擊不已的精神！（　田特派員）（吉：譯自十月十七日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c55">南太平洋空戰瑣記　從南太平洋歸來某報報道班員一夕談 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>靜靜的海而上，浪流澎湃雜洶湧着，乾木角屑般一片一片地掉下來。一面燃燒着，一面落下來的乾木魚支，那是美國陸軍所最自以為得用的「秘雷P三九號」單引擊戰鬥機、被我軍的新銳戰鬥機所擊　的狀態。經猛烈的集中轟學後，波濟層層起伏着，在那一瞬間，敵軍的飛機被擊墜了。初夏的五月，從東京出發，六月初到着最前綫基地的我，自到達以來，連日所見的都是這樣猛烈的戰關。</p>
<p>敵人的戰鬥機，「P三九」是最好的，「P三八」也很厲害。這是「洛基特製造」的雙引擎雙　戰鬥機，速力最快，右戰鬥機用。偵察機用二種。攻擊魯塞爾島的敵人時，是海軍部內屈指可數的名駕駛員某海軍大尉，和翱翔而來的敵方「P三八」型空戰。在交戰中，一面同樣互相競爭着昇高，一面加以射擊。在遭種塲合，那　退的一方，必被遭擊，祇有向所定自的，一直往前直銜·才是獲勝的要訣。且到今日為止，大部分的敵人怕互相交鋒，而設法逃避。但那時候的敵人，無論射擊多少，都不逃避，當然我們這方面也不會逃避。轟！轟！距離漸漸縮短了。似乎要對面相撞的時候，敵人把機首提高了了一點。因此，我大尉機潛過敵機之下，互相擦過。在那時候，敵方所發射的機關槍火，如雨點般落到大　機的駕駛席上。進行那樣激烈的戰鬥，是以證明敵人的飛行員中有着非常勇敢的人。</p>
<p>敵方勇而無謀</p>
<p>敵人的戰鬥機，實在墜落得很多了。　為審有國家的美國，在這裏逐漸在荏弱下去。事實上敵人的消耗，非常激烈。祇要我方不斷由擊，敵方基地上的戰鬥機即潛機減跡可是敵人却又從瓜達爾加納爾和魯塞爾基補充新的戰鬥機。遭一次敵方一定又頒到救兵了。這新來的飛機還是新近製造的。常然上面搭着新的飛行員，新手的敵人。因為不知道我們的厲害，於是取這樣無謀的戰法，那是「運動上的標的」戰術。敵方的飛行員大概全是學生出身，所謂初生之犢不畏虎。一但是他們所　的不過速力一，這在我方舅敢的荒駕，是毫不足懼的對手。且他們祗要飛機一被擊中，就立即張開降落傘逃命，降落海上，乘着橡膠製的浮袋，而敵方的高速魚雷艇即駛來把他們救起。敵方到到到處有高速艇的某地，在海上活動的高速艇為數很多，落在海中的飛行員，都可獲救。我們見此，不覺深為可恨。</p>
<p>夜間空襲塲合</p>
<p>夜間來　的敵機，在敵軍之中好像有幾個優秀航空人員雜在其間，但是其中也有若干胆小的像伙在內，有一次調三架飛機來襲××根據地，那天因有密靄所以三架敵機，都突人襲端，在襲端裏分為二架與一架，從雲端財張出來，二架與一架碰頭，彼此好像是敵對的，一見飛機就當作敵機，連忙用全部機舞檢亂射，演出自相殘殺的　劇，結果三架飛機彼此中彈受傷，這種令人捧腹的怪事，眞　有趣了。把夜間來襲的敵機擊落的一刹時，這是真正壯烈而愉快的情景，一向抽彈　　的巨大飛行保壘，忽然變成一個大塊　　烈焰飛　，敵方　　百戰不落的飛行保函、居然擊落，在我們看來是何等的愉快·仰首　空。莫不拍手　快，雖然經過機多的轟炸，但看見這種情景，是託　處身於前綫的關係，飛行堡壘一被擊落，敵方的航空人員，馬上用降落傘降陸，我方候着捕捉那些從業林中溜出來的傢伙，詢問他們的情形據說他們飛行員中百分之九十是學生，年齡都是廿三，四歲到廿七·八歲左右，有的是哈佛大學出身，有的是華盛頓大學出身，可據俘處稱：全軍的洧百分之三十，都在鬧着癖疾，可是專治是症的靈藥奎寧，都被我日本方面所得，敵方是相當的苦痛。</p>
<p>敵方本來已苦，現在更苦，這祇要看看接濟情形就能明瞭的，敵方用輸送機搭載糧食彈藥，再用降落傘把它投下，可惜不能持久，因為要使大軍登陸，無怪乎　懈了　潛工作，至論敵方部隊的登陸狀況，說也可憐，他們總要兩三日天氣不佳，守日本飛機不能活躍的時候，才齊集了輸送船團凍幹，其登陸情形規模相當的大，齊眾起來的大隊船團，靠近目的地後，後船上起卸貨物，總得二個鐘點，登陸完畢後，就用戰鬥機巡空，一方面準備高射砲陣地，構築防空壤，建般飛機塲。(鵬譯）</p>

<h3 id="c57">歌 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 文英</p>
<p>我愛歌。</p>
<p>當指揮棒有力地割過空際·當每個合唱隊員底胸中滾出一支悲壯的歌，我底心便激烈地躍動起來。歌聲在空中　聚起一片　　，抑揚的音響，運動着，鼓舞着千萬人，也拥動着，鼓舞着　者們自己。</p>
<p>女高音部底旋律像一條輝煌的銀箍，高吮，明亮，悠婉坳鑲嵌在雄壯的歌聲底邊上，引導著各音部有節　地念速或則除緩地向前進行。有時如大江上的鷗鳥，飛到白雲深處，又倏忽地諷墜下來，敏捷地掠過水面；歌聲逍遙自在地向上升高，圓潤地兜着圈子，反覆着一個動人的旋律，忽又低落沉入那雄渾的男聲部底波　裏，在那河面上激起一些散亂的，銀色的浪花。</p>
<p>緊跟着來的女低音則平靜而雅淑，清期的聲音觀托着高音部底高昂，完成了和聲上的必要的補充。那音波顫慄着，瑟縮地躲藏著小心地起伏在合唱底音域裏，它平平地伸展開來，像橫越過荒漢的原野的列車底節奏，明確而又莊嚴地飄向四方。</p>
<p>男高音明亮地　動起來，如同燦瀾的旭日從東方升起，照紅了半個天窮。它與女高音部分唱著主要的旋律。熱練的作曲技巧安排它走着曲折，斷續，高低的道路，展開一串汹湧澎湃的浪頭，一個追逐着一個地向前泛濫橫流。它，蒼鷹似地翱翔在音樂底太空里，昂着頭，鼓動着兩　健壯的巨翅，　悍地翻一個身，劃一條有力的曲綫把男女兩音部，明顯地截然隔開。</p>
<p>捲着低沉，宏譽，莊　的聲浪排山倒海而來的是男低音部底怒潮。它被壓抑在山崗底下。被夾在缺谷當中似地榨出如此憂　，着老的音響，運轉着八度進行的曲調。三和弦，或則則是七和弦底效果，於此乃得到最終的圓滿的完成。</p>
<p>如果說，女高音像萬物欣欣向榮的春天，女低音就像草枯花萎，淸新凉爽的秋季，男高音則如夏日底茁壯繁盛。男低音則如嚴冬底肅殺陰森：而四部合唱是四個季節底複雜的綜合與調和，有着多機的豐富的意趣。</p>
<p>像長江從萬山　里掙扎着奔瀉出來，一支歌曲從　手們口中歸出。忽而一午靜得如狂風　之後的湖泊，清徹可以鑑人；忽而如狂風暴雨下的海面，掀起了萬丈狂瀾。忽而精神煥發，震動着自由，滿足的高興，震動着戰勝，成功的歡欣，震動着恬適，安靜喜悅的，那　聲肅情地　舞飛揚，忽而轉入一支憂傷，哀絕的調子，那樣悲涼淒　，　聲遂延長着覺悟的顫悸。忽而氣憤填　，慷慨激昂，如戰馬長嘯。如鐵鳥轟鳴，歌聲節節升高，直入天際。指揮棒憂然停止，一切聲音驟然停歇，墜入沉寂里面。這時。在人們底心上交織着多少幻夢，多少情思，多少希望；這曲終後的片刻沉靜，更含蘊著崇高的藝術　魅力和無聲的音響的。</p>
<p>我不喜歡安靜，其更怕寂寞，但我顧意把自己關閉在狹窄的小　里，對着一架留聲機和一堆唱片，讓它轉動着，唱出一些熱烈的，激情的歌，我底心便飛翔起來，小室底四壁向周遭擴大，我徜徉在廣闊無涯的音樂底璀璨的　土裏面。　芒，浮第，亭代爾底一些小歌曲，　詠，康塔塔，會給我以無　的幻念，使我更激切地憧憬於明日的希冀。自然，我更愛投身到廣大的人　中間，抬起　子，屏着呼吸，聽一羣靑年合唱隊員底歌唱。那種塲合，他們底歌，會更猛烈地搖震著我底心坎。我們優秀的作曲家也一樣地常常給予我以鼓勵和啓示，我在他們底創作里。可以嗅到親切的，祖國底氣息。</p>
<p>我愛　，它使我底在這個社會染汚了的靈魂和情感得到了澄淸的洗滌。我　誠地感謝作曲者和歌手們！</p>

<p>程府，今天多熱鬧啊！程富　，今夭該不知如何快活，近五十歲的老頭兒，弄璋之喜。今天是那位小公子的一週歲。怎麼能不排酒筵，來慶祝一下呢？</p>
<p>阿英，她的心中，亦是非常快樂，她對這位小公子喂得白白胖胖的，這完全是她的功勞。</p>
<p>「阿英，你將小小寶抱來，讓賓客們看看。程富翁慈祥的聲音，傳入阿英的耳鼓中。這個提議，是一個姓王的客人所提，經衆人的附和，程當翁並不推却，並且他更想：「我有如此好的孩子，真正不錯。」</p>
<p>阿英抱了小　在席間穿梭時，沒有一人不稱贊小孩的福相，白胖，並且給阿英一封賞錢。當觀看完畢時，小實也睡著了，正欲去給他　時，另外一個姐姨授給她一封快信，她心中非常急，一年中，從鄉下來的信，俱是平信，此次的快信，來得頗蹊蹺。立刻將信拆開，裏面豎起兩根鵝毛，再看信時，她的眼前滿佈着金　　，她暈了。信上所載，盡是些不幸，滿紙的不幸，她的丈夫因生了傷寒，無錢醫治，一命嗚呼：她的兒子，因得不到充份的奶，　至枯萎而死。</p>

<h3 id="c59">父親 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 言焱</p>
<p>牆頭日歷，已薄成了一小小半，但還不斷地在一頁頁撕去，終於，那明顯的黑字，報告我：已臨到了繳貴日子。</p>
<p>父親的臉，跟着在一天天地陰沉－－更陰沉！</p>
<p>一早，他懷着希望的心，踏著較快的步伐，往烈日下奔忙。我明白他此行的動機與目的。</p>
<p>傍晚：拖著疲乏的瘦軀，綏侵地跨進家門，接著就倒在床上。我望他：面色慘白的怪難番，雙眉鎖得更緊！我知道他又是讓光陰空逝了，也一定白費了很多的好話，與痛苦的不自然笑臉，說不定還遭受了不算少的冷嘲熱諷，或難堪的臉譜和白眼！</p>
<p>「噯……噯！」連　的沉悶嘆氣。又開始在這斗室裹徊旋。</p>
<p>我怕聽那單調的嘆氣；不忍看那遭敗的　臉；我也受不了老年的他，　爲着我們－－我，弟，妹－－在承當苦難！</p>
<p>我年長、理應幫着分負一些兒重擔；但，現在？……</p>
<p>我打算了一個辦法。但。天　！這，　是本意？。我怎願向父親去說明？</p>
<p>今朝，父親又默默地坐在椅上，呆　着天花板。四周的喧嘈，擾不動他的思潮，像是入定的老僧，或是超脫了這塵世的隊士。但，豈爲遭般清高？還，分明是全神貫注在那萬惡的「錢」字上！</p>
<p>當我的目光，警到他老人家的那張沉　的愁臉時；我的心，竟不住有萬般的難受。</p>
<p>突然，弟與妹連跑帶跳地奔進來，手裏高執著一封信，　着：「爸，校裏的信。較裏的信！</p>
<p>信，暫時打斷了父親的思潮：同時，也吸引了我的靦綫。是的，這是校裹的僧。</p>
<p>父親用那抖顫的手，像是很費力地抽出了裏面的通告。</p>
<p>弟·妹·在兩旁；各伸長的　項，爭著賺。畢竟，第一個看完的還是父親。可是，他仍捏着那張油印的條子，帶著呆滯的目光，只管面對那板　出神。</p>
<p>「爸，眞的，為甚麼你老不青給我們付學費去？」才看完的弟，立刻帶着責間地說。</p>
<p>「……」父親連眼多不剎一下，仍依老樣地那麼坐着，也沒給他回答。</p>
<p>老半天，妹還沒看懂；一把、從父親手裏搶過加字條，要我解釋。</p>
<p>通告大意是：如再不付學費，就要除名了！</p>
<p>於是，妹也跟着向父親去　。繼之，眼　真也滾動　閃閃淚水。</p>
<p>「明……明天去付！　父親仍望着板　，慢慢地吐出這句話。</p>
<p>這，立刻使弟妹倆破涕爲笑：又跑呀跳的，一刹那，就消失了身影！</p>
<p>天呀！明天？明天去付？對！話多　說？但，錢？錢呢？</p>
<p>父親又開始在嘆氣了。</p>
<p>繳費……明天……錢……愁驗……嘆氣……這一切，鼓舞我，－終於，使我毅然地說出了那不願的辦法：</p>
<p>「爸，我要學生意去！」</p>
<p>父親意外地吃了一驚：「學生意去？……為甚麼不要再繼續讀書？」</p>
<p>「不為了甚麼！我總覺得讀書沒有甚麼大意思！」說著，我扭轉了頭。這違心之論，竟不住使我流淚。</p>
<p>終於，父親也明白了：「孩子，萬不要為著我，毀滅了你將來的立身基礎！書，總得讀。爸就吃虧在書讀得太少；有好幾次機會，自知力不勝任，眼巴巴地將職位讓給別人；要不然，爸，早不像現在這般地窮啦！至於錢不用著你操心，爸自會想法！不然。還可變賣點兒東西！……」我不忍再議；心坎。不知是辛酸還是歡喜。但，我難受！驀地，站起來，奔　牀上，伏在枕上，「鳥鳥」地放聲痛哭。</p>

<h3 id="c60">上海足球聯賽即將開始　檢討甲組七雄實力　東華與聯誼最稱雄厚 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>本年滬市足球界，因西聯足球會（一　滬聯會）結束而成歷史上之　　後，於是由　人主持之上海足球聯合會　崛　　　。此劃時代之轉變，不特　　我　隊歷來受盡西聯會壓迫之　辱。且從而奪囘　十年來　　之主權。因此在我中　足球史上，留下値得大　而特　之光　的一員</p>
<p>上海足球聯合會於上月召開成立大會，嗣復　首次理　會決定，組織　賽委員會及審判委員會，積極推　工作，　主持上海足球聯賽以接續「四　賽」外，並決定舉辦「市　盃」及「國際盃」二大盃賽，行見本年足球季，將有一番空前熱烈之情緖。</p>
<p>共五十隊參加</p>
<p>關於上海足球聯賽，已定十一月六日開賽。分甲，乙，丙三組，經　賽委員會審核准予參加者甲組七隊，乙組一二兩部各八隊，丙組分一二三部，每部九隊，共計五十隊加入逐鹿。查上屆西聯足球參予者，甲乙丙三組共祗二十七隊，本年幾增達一倍，氣象備見蓬勃，將來羣雄角逐，精彩情况，概可想見。</p>
<p>巨頭球員變動</p>
<p>查甲組中七隊，包括全滬最堅强精銳之陣容，其中參加上年四聯賽者計為聯誼，東　，葡商，猶太等四隊。史高扥盃冠軍聖芳濟已併入聖　，改名為　聯。三　（即前法捕）及三省，異軍突起，形成七雄之局勢。各隊實力，當以東華與聯誼最稱雄厚。惟兩隊陣容本年頗有微妙之變動，聯誼孫錦順與張林根相率返歸母隊東華，而東華之許文奎張昭　則聯袂投効聯誼。如　調動，與雙方均非「有　」。而　目下陣容　之，兩隊缺點類仍，聯誼原　　　　　之病態，　　去一張林根，則勢　以　　祥調充。前錄　上，許抵孫　　缺，但以　之後移，造成四缺一局　。故進攻力量極為軟弱。返　東　，以中衛綫不强為其大病，經此番調動，後衛有張（林根），莊（友仁），李（靑）三劍客，形成過剩局面，中衛則以張昭鵬之離去，更見鋒孫鐵　歸來，當可助長攻勢。惟少一阿奎，相差可謂無幾。故該　　聯誼之陣容，各有不可否認之弱點，實屬萬分可惜！</p>
<p>葡猶均屬平庸</p>
<p>至葡商與猶太兩四人勁旅，去年在西聯甲組中戰績平庸，本季葡商一仍　貫，如宿將考　坦能重作馮婦，實業或可增强。猶太因主將法凡笑參加　聯，陣容益為軟弱，上述二隊當無問津錦標希望。</p>
<p>三警即前法捕</p>
<p>僑聯隊本年異軍突起，擁有史高托盃　軍聖芳濟　下全部精銳，如潘里曼，許爾茲，M潘脫遜，格林堡，卡洛列　，　恩等，蓋以猶太之法凡笑，聖　　柱亞格夫，　少由　，軍容茂盛，近於　者盃中　　　聯誼，殊非易易。故本季四人隊中，當以該隊實力　稱　　，三　（即第三　　）為　　之貨幣，應下不　慣征能戰之士。　老　黃毛　　司托夫，小將　錕田等。　驃悍　　，　實力如何，　　　　　　　，開始後，始見　苗</p>
<p>三省球藝猛晋</p>
<p>三省即徐　中學隊，該隊在王　　父　導之下，球藝突飛猛晋，而　守紀律，尊重運動道德之精神，更非時下一　球隊　　望其　　　且隊　　　年輕力壯之靑年，茍能假以時日，前途實未　　　。　　徐　健　好自為之，惟本年初度參加　組，當不克　各　旅相頡頏，應仍抱「勝不　敗毋餒　之宗旨，　力邁進。」　　寄以　窮之勢　焉！</p>
<p>此外乙丙二組各隊，全滬次　球隊，　　參加。他日兵戎相見，會　疆　，羣雄各顯身手　必有　烈之爭奪及精彩之演出也。（張良）</p>

<p>圓門球為靑年體育賽　　滄君　發明，問世以來，盛極一時，此次夏十魁君發起普及盃圓門球聯賽，顧名思義，　為提倡此新頴運動之步驟，與　君發明之一番心血，相得益彰。聯賽原定於本日十七日假光夏中學舉行，因而延至廿三日，復以雨而再作第二次之延期，定　星期日在原處展幕。此一幕精彩所至之球賽，老天有意逗引，益使球迷慾望，殷且切也。　乘此一再延期之機會，走訪各組之實力，簡而記之，要亦為球迷之借鏡：</p>
<p>甲組</p>
<p>加入者為八隊，各隊實力頗見平均，而以强華四靑及南洋為最强。强華除原有張少卿瞿錫麟孔廣益都本生　好手，復得　脚包松圓之入伍，如虎添翼，益以　　恩東山再起，出任守門，雙多一層保障，聲勢赫赫，大有錦　非我莫屬之概，而集合巨人　納克二隊精　之西靑隊，其威脅力不亞於强華。該隊對於圓門球之　　，超乎華隊之上。　　每週該隊有二次以上之間門球練習賽，深得個中三味，　於奔攻守俱有相當體會之心　，　將如陶勃林基·沙司金·凱　密洛夫輩皆雄心勃勃，　一爭圓門球之寶座，實為强華心腹之患，其次　南洋除原班好手張邦綸韓龍海樊慶咸李壵等外，復得盧谷容　　細良之助陣。觀其陣容之堅硬，處心積慮可以想見，是則甲組形勢，必成上述三隊鼎足之勢，而將來演出之精彩，可以想像及之。餘如同華影·維仁隊·白隊雖屬實力稍差，　　為上帝之　，決非　　閒　之　　日　可有意外　　。我作此推測之後，亦　　　　意外之變化，一新我　耳目。</p>
<p>乙組</p>
<p>加入者少，中　　　　强　　　華三隊實力較强，而有一黑馬一　之猶太隊，本　，甲組　而聯賽當局以　隊對於足球籃球，固有　史　　於圓門球　　初次　　　　　降為乙組，以　身材之魁梧，籃球技術之程度而　，或能　　「黑馬」一鳴驚人，當為西靑乙及强人之勁敵。</p>
<p>女組</p>
<p>有六路娘子軍逐鹿，不　　非女子運動之好現象。際此盛會未展之前本不應有　斷言。以减少一部份　隊之興趣，甚願各隊勿　　氣餒，要知勝敗錦　，原為一種獎勵性質，　之運動道德及美德之表現。更甚於此者。値此女子體育　在竭力提倡之際，望各隊盡力發揮，　不負　倡者之一番苦心矣，於是　女組實力，余　以為將成綠隊之天下。綠隊集　啓秀，精武及愛國之健將而成，復請發明人錢旭滄君指導，好花有綠葉相扶。自覺賞心悅目。攻有黃明媛容淑　李韞芝之三虎將，守有王維珍　　雯劉珍寶之全材，可　　而缺　，是　理應不難直搗黃龍，　觀乎番將西靑　身高力大，且練習甚勤，雌心不可輕視，新興之三省隊有史瑞娟等之健將，自屬不可一　抹殺。所以此別開生面羣雌粥粥之　賽，決可一換球迷口味，造成不少　彩　頭。他如普及·猶太·雖屬實力較差，然皆摩拳擦臂，以求有好表演也。誠我人之眼福。</p>
<p>綜上所述，僅為管見所及，似是而非之論，尙希先進指示，有厚望焉！（梅必賢）</p>

<p>無疑地，瘦弱的人　了壯健的人　　生　　之心的，的確，壯健的人　可羨的；也是足以自幸的，然而能　鍜鍊而將體格發達得更完美的　，那是更　榮耀了。但是開始鍜鍊不久的人，決不能因自己鍜鍊的成績沒有你理想中的美滿而灰心，你必須要找出你所以不能得到美滿成績的原因；或是方法的錯誤，或是鍜鍊之過度與不及；更須明瞭一個人體格的發展是有限度的，決不能永遠發展下去。我們平時苦惱的鍜鍊，不過是追求一個合乎自己生理條件的美滿的體格，而不是一種無限止的奢求。我們不能不論，天生大骨骼的人，他鍜鍊起來似乎比較方便而容易收效。但不能不承認鍜鍊的方法是更重要。如果你所採取的鍜鍊方法是合理的話，那末你雖是一個小骨骼的人，也一樣可以得到極度健美的體格的。這裏我就開始介紹一種本為國粹但已漸趨沒落的優良的鍜鍊方法——摔角。</p>
<p>摔角原名角觝</p>
<p>摔角原名角觝，或稱手搏和相撲，欲稱　跤。最早發現於吾國漢武帝時。當時帝皇好此角觝戲，直到遜淸，此技最為普遍。八旗士兵，　　　　蒙人精此　尤多。歐美各國亦有角力（Wrestling）但與我國摔角之重技巧已不同。日本的柔道似乎與我人國摔角相仿，然其在技巧上似尙不及我國摔角的精深。我國摔角乃採纈各種拳術的精華，俗語說「三年　不及當年跤」。意思就是說，學三年拳術，不如學一年摔角，我　拳術的精巧，已　人　知。而摔角又是拳術之精英　聚，其技巧的深邃當可想　。</p>
<p>思想可以靈敏</p>
<p>摔角非但　　你以壯健的體格，宏　的肌肉；更　　成你動作的速捷，思想的靈敏，因為當兩人　　時，大家想以　巧來制　對方。於是　捷的動作產生，而思想也能藉此而　　。如果你能久練摔角的　，你的態度也會變得冷靜，　心　也會　穩定。要是　　喩　　　摔角的話　那末撲如　　守若　；靜似　了，　比脫兎　這　句是　適　也沒有了。</p>
<p>內臟也能强健</p>
<p>摔角　鍜鍊筋骨肌肉以外，也能使內臟强健。所謂「內鍊一口氣外鍊筋骨皮」。兼　摔角時　後左右　上下　　，剛柔兼　，面面　到。所以是一種全身運動，而不是　部的鍜鍊。至於在實用上，則强身之外，尙可禦侮　敵。因此摔角是一種優秀的運動。</p>
<p>摔角班已組織</p>
<p>可　　傳迄今，　　殆盡。上海雖也有三五塲合敎練此術。　類多簡陋不堪。且參與練習的人，大都缺乏道德上的修養，以　摔角不能　正傳，未免有些遺憾，今靑年會有識之士，有鑒於斯，而有摔角班的組織，特聘　術名宿摔角專家佟忠義先生擔任　問，而令作者也濫竽其間，擔任敎練。佟先生乃摔角前輩，堪稱袖手，年齡雖已花甲開外，但精神矍鑠，英勇不减當年。據佟先生稱：這是他數十年來練摔角的效果。由此看來，摔角非但可以强身禦侮。且可得享遐齡。（筆者尙有幾位老友，年皆古稀，而强健　　，　　　　他們日常運動），這是不　　　而予以抹煞的　至於作者，不過　　靑年會　局提倡體育的機會，而發揚摔角運動，以保國粹之永　，而　强国强民之目的罷了，然而作者一己之力有限，尙　勢心人仕，多予提倡，則幸甚！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Miscellaneous Thoughts on Increasing Salaries for Teachers and Staff <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Two news items were reported in the newspapers yesterday and the day before regarding the issue of salaries for primary school teachers and staff. The first was that teachers and staff from various municipal primary schools in the city went to the Municipal Finance Bureau to petition. Because their salaries were too low, making it impossible to make a living, they had previously sent representatives to the municipal government and educational circles to request an increase in living expenses, but without result. Therefore, they petitioned the Finance Bureau again. The Director of the Finance Bureau, Mountain, in principle accepted the requests they made, but before a detailed calculation could be made in conjunction with the Education Bureau, he could not give a definitive answer, but he could assure them that the salaries of municipal primary school teachers and staff would definitely be made higher than the average for private primary school teachers and staff, to ensure fairness. The second item was that subsidies for teachers and staff of private schools in the city would soon be issued. Because the municipal government, in view of the poverty of the teachers and staff of private schools, followed the request of the Municipal Education Association and agreed to grant a monthly subsidy of 500,000 yuan. The source of this funding was obtained by the municipal government with the consent of the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and was to be paid from the fees collected by the Tax Bureau to assist the municipal government. It was originally scheduled to begin in August, but as a result of discussions between the Municipal Finance Bureau and the Tax Bureau, the Tax Bureau could only raise 300,000 yuan in May, and would raise 500,000 yuan each month from October to December. The first batch of subsidies, totaling 800,000 yuan for September and October, has already been collected from the Finance Bureau by the Municipal Education Association. As for how to allocate it, the Education Association had already convened representatives from various district education associations to form a management and allocation committee to decide on various allocation principles and application procedures, striving for simple and thorough procedures, and scheduled to begin distribution from the 27th of this month.</p>
<p>After carefully reading these two news items, we have the following gratitude and several expectations:</p>
<p>Teachers and staff are role models, such a sacred profession; nurturing talent is such a great mission. With such a sacred profession and such a great mission, the salary they receive is unable to maintain a living. It seems unbelievable at first, but it is an ironclad fact. The existence and expansion of this fact will undoubtedly affect the decline of talent and the reduction of the quality of teachers, directly affecting the development of national education; indirectly, it affects the nurturing of nation-building talents.</p>
<p>The extent of the lack of popular education in our country accounts for the largest percentage among modern countries, and there are many illiterates everywhere, especially the out-of-school rate of school-age children is the most serious. How can the responsibility of national revival and social improvement be entrusted to illiterates? Then, promoting national education and eliminating illiteracy is the basis of the national education policy. Therefore, the need for teachers is self-evident. How can the treatment of teachers be so meager, and the responsibility that teachers should fulfill be so harshly demanded?</p>
<p>Although the municipal government's provision of living subsidies to teachers and staff of private schools in the city has a "drop in the bucket" feeling, the authorities' attention to this and the implementation of subsidies is commendable. However, the promised monthly subsidy of 500,000 yuan, which was to begin in August, has now been extended by one month and reduced by 200,000 yuan, which is regrettable. As for who between the Tax Bureau and the Municipal Government should bear the responsibility for paying the full amount, we, standing in the position of teachers and staff, cannot and do not need to distinguish, because they are both public funds, and there is no right to question. We would like to pray for the help of the Municipal Government and the Tax Bureau on behalf of the teachers and staff to pay the full amount as promised.</p>
<p>The salaries of municipal primary school teachers and staff should in principle be based on meeting the standards of living, rather than using "making them higher than the average for private primary school teachers and staff" as the basis. Because although municipal and private schools are different, the need for teachers and staff to make a living is exactly the same. The qualifications of municipal and private school teachers and staff may have strict and lenient forms, but there is no need to form an official divide in their salaries. We hope that when municipal school teachers and staff request salary increases, stating the reason that they cannot make a living is sufficient, and there is no need to use the subsidy for private school teachers and staff as a reason for comparison. At the same time, we hope that the education and finance authorities will "make a detailed calculation" as soon as possible and announce it, so that municipal school teachers and staff can work with peace of mind as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Secondly, in addition to the hope that the treatment of primary school teachers and staff will gradually improve, we also believe that the authorities and relevant parties should pay attention to cultural figures who also bear a heavy mission and are equally poor, especially those who rack their brains and live on royalties. The typesetting wages have reached the stage of seventy or eighty yuan per thousand characters, while the royalties for writers still linger at twenty or thirty yuan. There is a reason why there are few era creations and ingenious masterpieces.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Japanese Troops in Western Yunnan Approach the Outskirts of Lushui; Reinforcements Move Northward to Attack <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th – According to broadcasts from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Council issued a report on the Yunnan front on the 22nd, stating that Japanese troops have approached the outskirts of Lushui, a key point on the west bank of the Nujiang River. The fighting near Qigongfang, Suzi Prefecture, Yunnan Province, is extremely fierce. Japanese troops advancing north from the opposite bank of Liuku have repeatedly launched fierce attacks to break through the Chongqing army's defenses. Recently, with air and ground reinforcements, they have moved northward to attack and are currently engaged in fierce battles on the outskirts of Lushui. Fighting also continues near Lunma Tundong Street.</p>
<p>The Battle Zone is Entirely in High Ground</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 24th – After the Japanese troops in the Yunnan-Burma border launched operations, the Chongqing army in the Gaoligong Mountains has become trapped, which is also a fact admitted by Chongqing. According to a New York dispatch, the US special envoy recently explained the situation in that area, saying that the war situation in western Yunnan is becoming increasingly important, and the Chongqing army is in a major crisis. The Japanese army has recently launched an offensive, and troops advancing north along the highway from Myitkyina have recently arrived on the four banks of the Nujiang River, where they have joined forces with two other Japanese forces advancing north from the south. One of these forces charged through the Ma Zhangguan area, attacking the Chongqing army along the Gaoligong Mountains from Tengchong. Another force moved north along the Nujiang River from Longling to control important river crossing points in order to cut off the Chongqing army's retreat. The combat zone this time is entirely in high ground, at an altitude of 10,000 feet, which is the highest area in the world's battlefields. During combat, it is necessary to climb steep ridges and use hand grenades, rifles, mountain guns, etc. It is not yet clear whether the Japanese army will cross the river to fight. If the Chongqing army does not change its strategy and recapture the bridgeheads on the west bank of the Nujiang River, it will be impossible to launch a counterattack in northern Myanmar. If a Myanmar operation is launched this year, the Japanese army will be able to gain the advantage of preemptive action.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th – Since the Japanese army in North China launched the autumn anti-communist war in mid-September, the elite troops of the local Japanese army have been continuously sweeping and suppressing the communist army inside and outside Shanxi Province. In view of the fact that the communist army in the Taiyue Military Region is building base areas in the dangerous areas of central and southern Jin Province, in order to destroy them, they took sudden action on October 2nd to destroy the communist army's base facilities everywhere, and frequently won battles. According to reports, the remaining communist army in the area, that is, the communist army that failed to be wiped out in the Taihang Mountains campaign, is still lurking in the area and continuing to stir up trouble. In order to thoroughly destroy them and to make the people in the Taiyue area thoroughly understand the true meaning of Japan's new policy towards North China, with a view to establishing an administrative organization, this operation was launched. However, the elite troops of the Japanese army have achieved great results in this autumn anti-communist war.</p>

<h3 id="e9">German Defenses Strengthened Along the Coast of Salonika; No Change in Situation on Italian Front <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 24th – Huitong News Agency reports: Should anti-Axis invasion forces attempt to enter Salonika from both the sea and land, they will be blocked by strong fortresses. The various small islands in the Aegean Sea and the mountains on the mainland have been transformed into strong defensive strongholds by the German army. German engineers have learned from the defenses in Norway, as the terrains in the two places are similar, and the construction method of the local fortress positions is based on the anti-Axis campaign in the Balkans in 1918 as a reference. Steel walls are used along the coast to prevent the advance of landed troops. Machine gun nests are set up under the rocks along the coast. These facilities cannot be seen from the air. All other armaments and road facilities are also very complete.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 24th – The German News Agency's special correspondent in the Mediterranean region, Boellner, said: "The general situation on the Italian front on Friday was not much different compared to last week. In the north of the Gabania depression and in the Apennine Mountains, the superior numbers of British and American troops tried again to break through the German defenses and launched a fierce attack from the northeast, attempting to split the German flanks, but to no avail. Along the front line, the German army and the enemy engaged in stubborn battles. Whenever the British and American troops attempted to advance, the powerful German artillery, especially the mobile artillery, fired on the advancing enemy troops, inflicting heavy losses on them. This made the enemy feel that the gain of capturing the dilapidated towns was not worth the loss. For example, the occupation of Baranello was only of secondary importance, and before occupying the completely destroyed town, the British and Canadian forces had at least four regiments annihilated. The narrow strip of land occupied by the anti-Axis forces could not compensate for the loss of manpower and material resources they suffered. The fighting along the entire southern Italian front is proceeding as the German army expected. The initiative is still in the hands of the German army. On Friday, the main pressure of the British and American forces, supplemented by reconnaissance attacks, was focused on the upper reaches of the Volturno River and the railway line leading to the west coast of Italy. All offensive actions of several anti-Axis troops were blocked by German heavy artillery, and twice by German grenadiers. In the course of these battles, five British and American tanks and armored reconnaissance vehicles were either destroyed or immobilized. South of Baranello, the German heavy artillery and tanks launched an attack on the powerful British army near the Apennine Highway, forcing the enemy to abandon their preparations. In that area, German Stuka bombers and fighter-bombers raided enemy vehicle convoys along the much-damaged mountain roads. In the evening, a strong German bomber force bombed a British repair factory in the port of Naples, and launched a successful attack on the enemy ship concentration points in the western port area."</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 24th – Huitong News Agency reports: A German military spokesman told foreign journalists yesterday: "The terms 'gap' and 'breakthrough' often appear in recent German war reports. Their meaning is that when the Soviet army launches an offensive, the German army first bombards the positions with artillery fire, and then withdraws from the positions it defends to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. When the Soviet army stops its artillery attack and the infantry implements the offensive, the German army will also launch a counterattack. For this reason, the Soviet army can temporarily break into the German army's positions, but can recover them with slight losses. In this autumn battle, the German army has used this strategy to shorten its positions, which has been quite effective, and can often make the Soviet army's large forces unable to be used. Because the German army has shortened its front, its defensive posture has become increasingly stable."</p>

Regarding Turkey's policy towards the Balkans, he said: "Turkey should reach an understanding with the Balkan countries, and Turkey believes that the Balkan countries should also understand each other's difficulties, so Turkey always supports the Balkan Treaty." The Turkish envoy also made a heartfelt speech on Turkish-Hungarian relations, stating: "The traditional friendship between Turkey and Hungary is not a question of dispute, but a noble tradition to be maintained." He said: "He will take advantage of every opportunity to serve the interests of both countries."</p>

<h3 id="e20">Floral Silk in This City Can Be Freely Moved; Chamber of Commerce Explains Movement of Materials Between Counties <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The relevant trade association for cloth factories in this city believes that since silk-woven sofa fabrics and curtain cloths are not included in the items to be purchased, it follows that intra-city movements of these items should be allowed, so long as the movements remain outside the areas under special control. These movements should be treated the same way as cotton and sundry goods. There should be no reason to detain such goods. Inquiries reveal that members have reported that local police officers, lacking accurate information, are mistakenly impeding and restricting these movements. This is hindering the progress of post-war commerce. The relevant trade association has sent a special request to the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association, which in turn will send letters to all police stations within the city, instructing the police to release such goods. This would help merchants who are facing difficulties. The Second Police Station of this city, upon receiving this letter, immediately ordered its various sub-stations to inform their officers that the silk cloth in question is not an item to be purchased, and that it should be allowed to move freely. Indiscriminate seizure of such goods is not allowed.</p>
<p>The National Chamber of Commerce Control Association explains that movements of materials between counties and districts, if there are no special regulations, should be allowed. There should be no restrictions on free transport. Should there be unreasonable impediments, such incidents should be reported through legal channels. If these attempts are ineffective, the issue may be reported to the Association for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Special Wheat-Flour Commission Discovers Multiple Instances of Smuggling of Flour in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Four Other Locations <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The National Chamber of Commerce Control Association's Special Wheat-Flour Commission has been actively promoting the unified purchase and distribution of wheat-flour and bran in various locations. However, unscrupulous manufacturers have been attempting to reap excessive profits by disregarding the law and the plight of the impoverished segments of society. They are purchasing and trading in wheat-flour without the proper permits, and are smuggling and transporting these goods. This situation is significantly affecting the livelihood of the population and is having an outsized impact. The Chamber of Commerce has notified and instructed all its branches to pay close attention, and has carried out stringent investigations. In one instance, the Yi Ji foreign firm of Nanjing attempted to smuggle over 3,400 bags of flour to Bengbu. Upon learning of this, the Chamber of Commerce dispatched staff to carry out a thorough investigation. In the area of Nanxiang, the Li Chang and Tai Chang flour mills transported 3,090 bags of flour from Nanjing. After investigation, it was found that they did not obtain the proper permits. The Chamber of Commerce immediately seized the flour. The Zhenjiang office discovered a transport train carrying 200 bags of privately transported wheat flakes. Together with the local police, they dispatched staff to seize and store the goods. The flakes will be purchased at the price of bran. In the area of Wuxi, multiple factories are producing flour from wheat without reporting these activities, and are privately selling the produced flour. The Chamber of Commerce has already reported this to the authorities in charge, requesting severe punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e22">The 25th Rationing of Rice Opened Yesterday in Southern Part of This City <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>With regards to the 25th round of per capita rice rationing in various districts within the controlled areas, the city's Food Bureau has assigned allotments and has instructed the various public entities to pay and issue rice. Rationing opened in the southern part of this city yesterday. Each person is allocated one sheng of polished rice. The price has been set at 8 yuan per sheng. The deadline is the 30th of this month; rations will not be provided after the deadline. Rationing will also begin in other districts as soon as the procedures for issuing rice are completed.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Glassware Dealers Agree on Allocation Quotas: Small Dealers Receive 10% <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Since the relevant authorities implemented a rationing system for various essential and non-essential materials, speculators have been severely threatened. However, due to possible improprieties by a few guild leaders, disputes have frequently arisen. It is now understood that the authorities are paying close attention to these malpractices and have decided to find ways to correct them in order to meet the original purpose of the rationing system. According to inquiries by a Shanghai News Agency reporter yesterday, the local glassware trade association has historically been divided into large and small dealers. Because the allocation of glassware has been entirely enjoyed by the large dealers, while the small dealers have not received any allocation at all, disputes have arisen everywhere. Subsequently, through the mediation of individuals such as Huang Ru-liang and Lu Geng-chen, an agreement has been reached whereby the large dealers, including the Japanese trading firms, will allocate 10% of all incoming goods to the small dealers. Therefore, this dispute has been resolved. Currently, the small dealers have organized their own distribution team and have established an office at 50 Kanfen Lane, which began operations immediately. In order to ensure that all members of the trade understand the situation, the association will issue a notice to prevent misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Regarding the rationing of essential daily necessities such as soap and matches, the Materials Allocation Section plans to implement the second step, the actual rationing, on November 1st. Therefore, all preparations have been completed, and all retailers have been designated. These retailers were selected from all businesses in the first and second districts based on recommendations by trade associations. However, some businesses that do not have the physical appearance of retail stores have had their qualifications as retailers revoked after investigation by the Materials Allocation Section. As of now, a total of 397 retailers have been designated. The numbered cards will be printed within the next week and distributed by the various certificate issuing offices to household heads, who will be notified to make purchases from nearby retailers according to their numbers.</p>

<p>Recently, streetcars on all routes have become extremely crowded. Although the streetcar company has increased the number of vehicles, this has not been enough to alleviate the problem. However, streetcar conductors often use the large number of passengers as an excuse, claiming that there is no room in the cars, or because passengers are rushing and causing inconvenience to their work, they unreasonably speak harshly and use abusive language towards people, which is deeply regrettable. It is now understood that the streetcar company has decided to strictly prohibit such behavior, and anyone may report such incidents. However, it is necessary to provide a detailed record of the conductor's number, as well as the time, circumstances, and your own real name and address, so that legal action can be taken.</p>

<p>The Xinzha Security District under the First Police Bureau of this city is currently re-registering households and has issued household survey forms, ordering each household to fill them out again. The Xinzha Security District Committee attaches great importance to this matter and has brought it up for discussion at its executive meeting. It plans to require each household to fill out four copies (one for the head of the household, one for the head of the neighborhood, one for the head of the district, and one for the police bureau's security district office). The standard for filling out the form is to include only those who actually reside within the district. Each household survey form must be reviewed and stamped by the head of the neighborhood as proof. To prevent corruption, the Xinzha Security District Committee solemnly declares that security district personnel are not allowed to collect fees for household survey forms. If any of the above occurs, citizens are welcome to report it, and it will be strictly investigated and prosecuted. If citizens make mistakes while filling out the form, they may exchange the discarded form for a new one at the police station.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Shanghai Deaf-Mute School: Cultivating Talents, Organization and Equipment <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Although the establishment of the Fu Ya School [Shanghai Deaf-Mute School] was somewhat late, it quickly gained an important position in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The education of deaf-mute children requires more complete facilities than ordinary education, to compensate for the inadequacies of teachers' oral instruction and finger pointing. Principal Wang spoke of the school's past facilities with unconcealed emotion. In the period when it was affiliated with the Hongqiao Road School for the Blind, although the equipment for deaf-mute education could not be said to be "having everything," it was barely sufficient for the needs of sixty to eighty students. At that time, in addition to ordinary academic subjects, special courses in crafts were offered, so that each student could learn a specialized skill to prepare for future livelihood. Unfortunately, everything was lost in the war. Later, it moved to No. 37 Bilitan Road. Although the equipment had to be simplified due to the limited resources, the environment was still very good. At that time, there were nine classrooms, as well as a library, auditorium, dining hall, sports ground, basketball and soccer fields, and very well-built dormitories for boys and girls. Now, they have only become beautiful memories.</p>
<p>The new school site at 33 Huangjia Sha Road is a detached Western-style house with three floors and seventeen rooms, divided into five classrooms, as well as one office, dining room, and recreation room each. Five dormitories for boys, girls, and young children are distributed on the second and third floors and are arranged in a relatively orderly manner. It is said that the dormitories have nannies responsible for taking care of the daily lives of the boarding students, paying special attention to cleanliness and hygiene, and also encouraging students to focus on cleanliness spontaneously in education. Other laundry rooms, bathrooms, kitchens, and toilets are simple, but they are well-managed, and can be compared with those of large universities. The playground is also adequately equipped, so the environment can be said to be suitable for deaf-mute education. In terms of organization, according to Principal Wang, the school is currently divided into a two-year preparatory course, a four-year primary school, a two-year senior primary school, a three-year junior vocational course, and an affiliated normal training course. All deaf-mute children between the ages of seven and fourteen from respectable families can enroll. The enrollment procedures require advance registration, with parents filling out an application form. After review and acceptance, they will be notified immediately for formal enrollment. The tuition fee for this semester is 340 yuan, miscellaneous fees are 60 yuan, and accommodation fees are 200 yuan, for a total monthly fee of about 500 yuan. However, in reality, the number of people receiving free or half-price education is also not small. There are 62 students this semester, 45 boys and 17 girls, with 19 boarding students, including 12 who are refugee children. All students are deaf-mute children, but a few have been able to make simple phonetic sounds.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Teaching</p>
<p>The current school building is not bad either. Entering the gate is a schoolyard that is not too big but not too small either. Along the bamboo fence, flowers and plants are planted. It is a place with a serene and elegant atmosphere. Inside the classroom, the achievements of deaf-mute students, the watercolor paintings on the walls, the portrait sketches, and the handicrafts in the glass cabinets all give people a good impression. The classroom next to the wall is the preparatory class. A deaf-mute female teacher is using gestures and other methods to teach more than a dozen deaf-mute children. Seeing her busy and nervous appearance, it is clear that teaching them is much more difficult than teaching ordinary children. According to Principal Wang, the preparatory course is two years long, equivalent to a regular kindergarten. After completing the course, they will enter the primary school.</p>
<p>On the second floor, the first and second grades share a classroom. Each grade has a female teacher teaching separately. The first grade is learning pronunciation. The teacher randomly points out one or two girls to recite simple texts. Surprisingly, they can all produce a pronunciation that is very close to standard Mandarin. Deaf children are not mute, which is definitely not an ideal. The second grade is practicing calligraphy. Each student is copying an article that is not very short, and everyone copies it neatly, and the handwriting is clear and correct. You can't tell that it was written by low-grade children. Two teachers are teaching the third and fourth grades. The students are relatively older, and teaching is done using sign language. The fifth and sixth grades share a classroom, and a teacher implements small group teaching. Each group has five or six people who sit around a table with the teacher. Everyone has their own textbook. The teacher explains each word and sentence using gestures and written communication. The students are studying carefully. When this group is being taught by the teacher, the other group studies independently. The teacher is busy enough to be out of breath.</p>
<p>The main subjects at the Shanghai Deaf-Mute School now are: civics, pronunciation, visual language, sign language, Mandarin, ruler usage, written communication, Japanese, English, general knowledge, written arithmetic, abacus, history, geography, hygiene, art, physical education, calligraphy, etc. Among them, the art course includes Chinese painting, charcoal painting, pastel painting, watercolor painting, and utensil painting.</p>
<p>The normal training course attached to the deaf-mute school is divided into junior and senior levels, with the aim of cultivating teachers specializing in deaf-mute education to meet social needs. Those who graduate from high school or normal school can enter the senior training course, which lasts for one year and focuses on practical training. Those with junior high school education or equivalent academic ability can enter the junior training course, which lasts for two years and emphasizes both learning and practice.</p>
<p>In addition to ordinary academic subjects, there was originally a junior vocational course, which was scheduled to be two years long, teaching art, Chinese typing, mechanical drawing, and embroidery. Now, because the school building is relatively small and the school equipment is not complete, it has not been possible to hold it. If enthusiastic people in society can provide assistance, Principal Wang said he is determined to restore it in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Principal Wang solemnly stated that the school not only focuses on academics but also makes every effort to cultivate good character in deaf-mute children. Because deaf-mute children and young people have relatively simple minds and are easily influenced, teachers must lead by example, and students must encourage each other to create an excellent academic atmosphere and cultivate citizens with sound moral character.</p>
<p>Comments from the Economic Sector</p>
<h3 id="e33">Construction Ministry's Construction Bonds <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>According to recent newspaper reports, the Construction Ministry will issue a considerable amount of construction bonds to finance its three-year plan. The planned three-year plan is divided into three parts: water conservancy, transportation, and urban construction. In water conservancy, the decision has been made to first dredge East Taihu Lake and open up the wasteland along the coast of East Taihu Lake. At the same time, the new canal in northern Jiangsu will be excavated. In transportation, the decision has been made to first open up new highways to facilitate wartime transportation. In urban construction, the decision has also been made to gradually carry out urban construction step by step.</p>
<p>At a time when countries around the world are competing to implement five-year plans and ten-year plans, a three-year plan cannot be considered an exaggeration. However, the amount of money needed is probably quite astonishing. Some feel that in order to prevent the amount of construction bonds issued from becoming too large, the urban construction part should be reduced in scope or even temporarily abandoned. Because people at the current stage feel that cities are safer, they flock to live in cities. If cities must be built at this time, wouldn't it further encourage the concentration of the population in cities? Therefore, it seems that more or even all of the time, funds, and manpower should be used for water conservancy and transportation construction, because one will help increase agricultural production, and the other will help the exchange of materials. Construction is production, and production is construction. The ultimate goal of issuing construction bonds is still to ensure wartime production, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>In addition, the huge amount of public bonds that the Construction Ministry will issue in the future should first be digested by the people to absorb the surplus purchasing power in the hands of the people. It should not be underwritten by issuing banks first, to avoid the drawbacks of currency issuance and rising prices.</p>

<p>After the authorities made adjustments to the trade associations in this city and merged them into unified organizations, most of the trade associations in this city have completed adjustments and started working. Assisting the authorities in adjusting and balancing prices to maintain the people's livelihood is being actively carried out. The city's area is vast, including various special districts such as Nanqiao, Beiqiao, Chuansha, and Chongming, which are far away from the city center. Therefore, various trade associations have established offices in various districts as needed to facilitate the promotion of services throughout the city. The competent authorities have approved the establishment.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) The official prices for various food items in Nanjing for the latter half of this month have now been publicly discussed and finalized by the respective trade associations, and submitted to the municipal government for approval and official announcement for implementation. It is reported that the municipal government has specifically ordered members of the trade associations to earnestly implement the prices. In addition, economic police have been dispatched to conduct inspections at any time. It is hoped that all citizens will assist the authorities in reporting violations of compliance by various stores so that they can be severely punished.</p>

<p>The authorities in this city are making considerable progress in stabilizing the people's livelihood, controlling materials, and suppressing prices. Yesterday, it was learned that all companies and firms, regardless of their nature of business, must classify their inventory at the end of each day, report the types and quantities of goods purchased, and submit a list to the trade association. The trade association will then report it to the relevant authorities for reference. As for the methods for transporting materials and obtaining certificates, the relevant authorities are still trying to manage them to prevent materials from being hoarded and diverted.</p>

<p>The financial and industrial situation in Shanghai was still stable last week. Compared with recent events, there has been no change. People's minds are at ease. Since the government implemented wartime economic policies, financial management has become more meticulous, and the use of funds has become more flexible. The rationing system for various daily necessities for the people's livelihood has been gradually strengthened. Attempts to manipulate hoarding behavior have completely disappeared. Even if illegal merchants are hoarding materials, it is no longer enough to stimulate the psychology of the society and the people. Therefore, all financial, industrial, and commercial sectors are operating normally under the management of the government authorities. Therefore, the market conditions for exchange rates, silver, public bonds, stocks, military notes, and joint banknotes have changed only slightly. The money supply has become loose, and the overnight interest rate has risen from two cents to one cent and six points. The supply and demand of food products such as rice, grains, beans, oil, sugar, and flour are becoming more abundant, and prices are stable. The rationing system adopted by the authorities for soap and matches has eliminated speculation, and black market prices have fallen.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 24th, Central News Agency) The Central Reserve Bank has joined forces with various banks and money shops in Nanjing to organize a prize savings week. Since the intensive preparations and publicity in recent days, the general public has already understood the meaning of the savings campaign organized by the authorities. Therefore, all banks and money shops in the city, in addition to the Central Reserve Bank itself, will uniformly begin accepting savings from the public starting on the 24th and lasting until the 31st of this month. During this period, any citizen who deposits a fixed deposit of 500 yuan or more will be given a special preferential interest rate and will also have the hope of winning a prize as an incentive.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Japanese Military Expert Discusses the Pacific War Situation <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) A military expert here discussed the Pacific war situation, saying: "Since the U.S. military began its counteroffensive on the Solomon Islands in early August last year, the Pacific war front has entered a new phase. Since then, for one year and three months, the Japanese and American forces have deployed their full strength of land, sea, and air forces to launch fierce decisive battles one after another. The Japanese army, in order to cope with the changes in the war situation, withdrew from Guadalcanal Island in early February this year and changed its strategic policy, adopting a defensive posture against the enemy's offensive, and annihilating the enemy forces that came to attack everywhere. This tactic is called the 'bleeding operation' and has achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>"After withdrawing from Guadalcanal Island, the Japanese army subsequently withdrew from Kolombangara and Vella Lavella Island in early October. Also, since the Japanese army withdrew from Buna on the New Guinea front, the Salamaua and Lae fronts have also gradually moved north. Currently, the Japanese and American forces are engaged in fierce battles in the area north of Finschhafen. The Japanese army has achieved great results in the withdrawal operation. The American Economic Magazine, which was published on the 13th of last month, also stated: 'Recent offensive operations in the Pacific have proven that the U.S. military's counterattacks on various islands are not only slow but also require great sacrifices.' This proves that the new tactics adopted by the Japanese army have made the enemy feel disturbed. This is because the Japanese army's bleeding tactics are the only way to conduct operations before the Japanese army launches an offensive. In the Great East Asia War, the Japanese army must go through the following</p>
<p>three stages to achieve final victory: the first stage is to obtain military resources and strategic strongholds in the southern regions to establish Japan's invincible position. The strategy adopted by the Japanese army during this period was to attack and suppress the enemy, while the British and Americans retreated and prepared for a counteroffensive. In the second stage, the enemy launched a total counteroffensive against Japan because its productivity had reached its peak. Japan adopted bleeding tactics in response and actively strengthened its combat power during this period. The third stage is to use bleeding operations to consume the enemy's combat power and then launch another offensive while the enemy's camp is in chaos, destroying the enemy's military power in order to make the enemy surrender. From the outbreak of the war to the start of the U.S. counteroffensive last August, it was the first stage of the war situation. In this short period of eight months, the Japanese army successively consolidated its position against the enemy forces in Greater East Asia, secured the treasure trove of military resources in various southern regions, established an invincible position, and laid the foundation for certain victory. However, according to historical records, offensive operations are difficult to accomplish in one stroke when countries with equal strength fight each other, especially in a vast battlefield, coupled with the development of modern weapons technology. Because</p>
<p>after the attack progresses, it is isolated from the supply resources such as soldiers, weapons, ammunition, and food. It is necessary to prepare a long transportation and supply line, and under the accumulation of damage such as battles and diseases, the dangers of these conditions actually exceed the benefits gained from the favorable conditions during the attack. Therefore, the danger gradually increases, and failure of the offensive is a common phenomenon. At this time, the attacking army should immediately decide on the strength of both sides, assess the limits of the possibility of attack, and correct the strategic tactics. Take the appropriate battle line as the limit, stop the attack operations that have been carried out, adopt a defensive posture, gradually carry out combat power with the smallest possible cost, prepare the rear supply line, and devote efforts to maintaining the military power during the second stage of attack operations. It is important to eliminate the enemy in one fell swoop. And at this time, it is impossible to consider the gains and losses of local geography. Therefore, the withdrawal operation from Guadalcanal Island is also very remarkable. The Japanese army's withdrawal operation from the island was a very successful way to change the strategic method in response to the shift in the war situation amidst various difficult war situations. This battle case can be</p>
<p>eternally recorded in military history. The soil only occupies 2,000 square miles, and Buna is just a remote city, but the Japanese army has contained the enemy forces for about half a year before implementing withdrawal operations in these two places, and during this period, the Japanese side's sacrifices and casualties were only 16,734 people, and the aircraft that self-destructed and did not return counted as 139. On the other hand, the damage suffered by the enemy US-Australian forces was great, with more than 25,000 casualties, 230 aircraft shot down and destroyed, more than 30 artillery pieces destroyed, and 25 tanks destroyed. Also, from the end of June last year, when the enemy U.S. forces landed on Rendova Island, to the early October when the Japanese army retreated from Kolombangara Island and Vella Lavella Island, the damage suffered by the enemy in the vicinity of New Georgia Island was about 11,200 people, about 700 people on Rendova Island, and about 1,000 people near Vella Lavella Island, totaling 15,000 people. The Japanese army was preparing the the the Salamaua and Lae areas, and gradually began to advance from the beginning of the month, and completed the assembly in the northern area of Lae in the middle of the month. During this period, the Japanese side fought about 2,000 people. The enemy's damage is estimated to be 12,000 people. If combined with the naval operations of the same period, from the first naval battle of the Solomon Islands to the night battle on the Kolombangara Island waters, the naval battles of the past year in the South Pacific City were calculated, and the Japanese side's losses included the sinking of 20 ships, the destruction of 30 ships, the sinking and destruction of 20 ships, and the self-destruction, non-return, and injury of 700 aircraft. The enemy's losses included 150 enemy ships sunk, and 50 ships fired, with battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers sunk, 60 ships sunk, 20 ships sunk, and 3,000 aircraft hit, its damage number is extremely large, the enemy</p>
<p>Since the United States has been loudly advocating counteroffensive against Japan, it has been one year and three months since then, and it has sacrificed huge manpower and military needs. What it has gained is only to move north from Guadalcanal Island to Vella Lavella Island in the Solomon Islands, and to advance slightly from Buna in New Guinea. This shows the difficulty of its counteroffensive. From this point of view, we can see that the Japanese army's attrition operations are not passive operations, but active operations. As mentioned above, the greatest goal of attrition operations has been mentioned above. The Japanese military is actively enriching its combat power during this period, so that it has the means to prepare the second offensive power in order to win the final victory. Also, since the Quebec meeting, the anti-Axis countries have shouted the war with the Pacific war front as the first principle. Some people in the anti-Axis countries also advocate that "the anti-Axis army now seems to be equal to letting go</p>
<p>Japan is powerful. If we know that we will seek to magnetize the Axis forces by next year, and then transfer it to Japan for combat, it will take a lot of effort." One foot proves that the enemy is also deeply concerned about giving Japan the surplus of time, which will make Japan's military strength have great achievements.</p>

<p>The Section One Fire Department's record of fire and rescue work for September is as follows:</p>
<p>Emergency ambulance dispatches: 119 times. Hospital vehicle dispatches: 192 times. Hospital vehicle (transporting infectious disease patients): 55 times. Total: 366 times.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the number of fire incidents this month has increased compared to last month. In past years, fires have always been more frequent in winter than in other seasons. Therefore, it is necessary to remind citizens to be vigilant. In addition, the fire that occurred at 5:20 PM on September 22nd at Changxin Chemical Factory, No. 471 Xiaoshadu Road, was the main reason for the increased fire damage this month. The number of emergency ambulance dispatches in the rescue service was less than last month, presumably because the number of infectious disease patients is gradually decreasing.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Second Act of the Jimin Cup Basketball Tournament: Renyu Wins Over Xiqing; Women's Green Team Defeats Mixed Team <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Jimin Hospital initiated the Jimin Cup Charity Basketball Tournament to raise funds for guidance. The second battle started at 7 PM last night at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Center. As a result, Renyu reversed the defeat and overcame Xiqing with a score of 24 to 18. In another scene, the women's San-Yi (Three Provinces) team mistakenly registered and changed to a mixed team to fight the Green Team. As a result, the Green Team won with a score of 18 to 9. During the game, there was also a charity ball auction, hosted by Huang Yanfang and Huang Zhenshi. Li Houshi generously donated and purchased it at a high price of 40,000 yuan. The women's performance took the stage first. The Green Team's Quan Yunzhi and Huang Mingyuan scored in succession, while the mixed team's Liu Zhenbao and Huang Fuping could not reverse the tide. The Green Team defeated the mixed team with a score of 18 to 9. In the finale, Xiqing's Funik made the first record. Yeren added icing to the cake. Renyu's Zhuo Guorong acted as a foil, scoring two points. The two sides formed a seesaw battle. Renyu waited for Wang Chuqing to hit a long shot, and reversed the score to 8 to 7. Xiqing pursued directly. At the end of the first half, Xiqing led 12 to 11. After changing sides, Renyu was cautious. The battle became increasingly tense. Lin Weicong and Sha Kejin were successively penalized off the field for four fouls. The performance gradually became relaxed. Renyu had to make every throw, and their stamina was frightening. They won with a score of 24 to 18. The final battle is scheduled for the 26th (tomorrow) at the same location, with the final between West Ken and Renyu.</p>
<h3 id="e44">"Gone with the Wind" Impressions: A Call for the Student Aid Movement <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Saving money in the most difficult of lives, I watched a struggling performance of "Gone with the Wind" in Paris for ten dollars.</p>
<p>I am a poor student. With the help of the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund, I was able to enter the high threshold of the university. Therefore, I have a special feeling for watching "Gone with the Wind." Watching the fiery scene on the stage, my emotion is twofold: on the one hand, it is the excitement that the plot gives me; on the other hand, it is the response caused by the spirit of hard work.</p>
<p>The "Gone with the Wind" described on the stage, whether in theme or form, seems to be different from the original work, and even further away from the movie "Gone with the Wind." "Gone with the Wind" takes another path. It depicts a group of young people in the Northern Expedition era - a group of petty bourgeoisie under the tide of激邊下小階級. Blind enthusiasts (such as the Ke brothers), utopian dreamers (such as Zha Ti), and opportunistic revolutionaries (such as Gan Folan) all have a rough silhouette. Wei Xili and Bai Ruide, as the protagonists, the former is a typical representative of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals. They have perfect character and are enthusiastic about the revolution, but cannot be a soldier; the latter sympathizes with the revolution, but stands far away and becomes a frivolous cynical - a complete individualist. If I guess correctly, I think the theme that the playwright wants to write in "Gone with the Wind" is only one point: that is, the petty bourgeoisie's illusion about the revolution. This is a very intimate work for us.</p>
<p>The hard-working performers are all the best in terms of acting skills. In my opinion, the distribution of this performance may not be the most ideal match; however, the performers' efforts, regardless of whether the play is heavy or light, all give us a "spiritually full" and "lively" impression. Coming from the Shanghai Professional Troupe system, the hard-working drama workers, from directors and actors to technical guards, have a special characteristic: that is, their serious and meticulous work. I think this is really the best morality for drama workers, and it is worthy of our emotion and praise.</p>
<p>And the most significant meaning of this hard-working performance is the promotion of the student aid movement. For all student aid funds or loan funds, the enthusiastic donation of social figures is certainly a most valuable act, but cooperation like the hard work and Shen Bao Student Aid Fund, I think it is particularly worthy of approval, because it is active, and the meaning is also twofold - it is a drama movement, and at the same time, it has made a practical promotion of the student aid movement.</p>
<p>I am a young man who has been cultivated by Shen Bao Lang Xue. After watching "Gone with the Wind," I could not help but be happy and amazed, and I could not help but express my personal ten superficial views. I hope that because of the promotion of the hard-working troupe, the student aid movement can become more prosperous and popular! (Wu Shanqing)</p>

<p>The long-term (six-month) credit loans for the ten-end period of industry and commerce in Shanghai have been prepared by each of the exchange houses and each of the industrial and commercial customers. According to the regulations of the Exchange House Association for handling long-term credit financing, all payments are settled in full on the two-day closing dates at the end of October and April to maintain customary transactions. According to the Central News Agency reporter's exploration with the person in charge of the Qianye (Money Trade) Association, the industry has completed the long-term credit accounts released for the ten-end period of this year with most of the local merchants, and the situation is very good. For the firms that have always been known for their transactions, the extension will be granted until the end of April next year for those who must continue to conduct business on credit. However, in recent years, due to the authorities' crackdown on hoarding, suppression of prices, and tightening of loans, the long-term credit financing is only for those who have had previous transactions and are legitimate industrial and commercial businesses. The industry has decided not to accept loan requests from other households in order to comply with the government's financial management policies. The business of the ten-end period is only handled by the exchange houses, and the bank loans are subsidiary matters. According to the current business of the banks, there are two types of business: mortgage loans and credit loans. The loan period is still handled in accordance with the current laws and regulations of the authorities. Now it is learned that the Qianye Association will hold a discussion and decision-making meeting on the internal market for the ten-end period at 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 25th). As for the new long-term credit financing after the ten-end period, each bank will still handle it, and will only accept applications from those who have legitimate uses or develop productive businesses and have substantial guarantees.</p>

<h3 id="e53">The Life of a Typesetter <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Happy in It</p>
<p>I am a typesetter in a printing factory. Speaking of it, the printing factory also belongs to the cultural industry. Although I am called a worker, I cannot be confused with a group of peddlers and porters, because my work is quite labor-saving. I do not need to carry on my shoulders or lift with my hands. I specialize in using my hands, brain, and eyesight. Therefore, my qualifications must be more intelligent, and I must also know some foreign languages, such as English, Japanese, German, etc. In particular, Japanese is more frequently used today. Almost every manuscript needs it. Speaking of it, we are also technical personnel, so this kind of work cannot be undertaken by outsiders.</p>
<p>Speaking of the harshness of our living conditions, it is truly extremely low. The monthly salary I get is only 300 yuan (including breakfast expenses). May I ask, at this time of high 物価(prices/inflation), how can this meager salary of 300 yuan be used? Not to mention supporting parents and raising children, even personal pocket money is not enough.</p>
<p>Although nominally our shop provides lodging, unexpectedly the shop only provides one porridge and one meal a day. Lunch is not provided. Now even the white porridge for dinner has been reduced to being mixed with sweet potatoes, taro, or 趨類 (similar) things to fill the stomach. It is also pitiful to say that after working hard for a day, the only meal of white rice per person is at noon.</p>
<p>Speaking of accommodation, what we sleep on is neither a bed nor a mattress. We sleep on the floor of the workshop, so the ground is our tatami.</p>
<p>I work indoors all day without seeing the sun. It seems that there is no green 相見(chance to meet) the sun. The daily working hours are from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Due to lack of nutrition and unsanitary conditions, the colleagues' physique is quite weak. If there is a slight carelessness, there is a possibility of getting sick. Fortunately, I am a person who has always paid a lot of attention to exercise. I must practice boxing in the morning and evening spare time, so my body is still healthy. I am not often sick all year round.</p>
<p>Although my treatment is so low and my life is so hard, I do not feel depressed because of this, because I am very interested in this work. Although I am working all day without a moment of 空　(free time), I think that my war industry is the cultural industry, the future is bright and great, and serving the public is my responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="e54">*Shen Bao* Weekly, Resumed Publication No. 7: Savage Bloody Battle in Nassau Bay: Warriors Fired Up and Fearless <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Since our forces landed in Nassau Bay, the situation on the New Guinea front, centered on Lae and Salamaua, has been intensifying, with fierce decisive battles erupting one after another. The battlefield as of yesterday was riddled with large craters filled with stagnant water. Our brave warriors, like enraged lions, valiantly ambushed the enemy's large land forces equipped with superior heavy weaponry. Their heroic demeanor was no different from that of divine soldiers. Many wounded soldiers, after receiving brief bandages at field hospitals, hastily returned to the front lines. How could one not call such a struggle heroic, seeing soldiers with blood-soaked bandages on their limbs, holding guns with one hand while using a cane, and officers with wounded arms still tightly gripping their swords and commanding relentlessly? If the Solomon Islands battle was a "bloody battle," then the New Guinea front is a "death struggle." What follows is from Lieutenant Yanagida, a military doctor:</p>
<p>Eagerly Going to Battle</p>
<p>The American landing in Nassau Bay occurred on June 30th. To prepare for the enemy's large-scale counterattack, our forces gradually fortified their positions. The weakness of our forces in the Mubo area was most concerning, and reinforcing that area was a matter of utmost urgency. Thus, amid the enemy's torpedo boats' rampant attacks, a certain unit's main force was sent to that area using suicide boat maneuvers. The main force of a certain self-proclaimed elite unit, upon arriving at its destination, did not rest. It immediately launched an attack on the American stronghold of Wau. The enemy air force, upon learning of this, immediately mobilized. Large enemy aircraft such as "Consolidated" and "Boeing" soared through the sky like blood-sucking demons, dropping heavy bombs and strafing with machine guns, leaving almost no room for even a rat to hide. The main force of the self-proclaimed elite unit was powerless against this and, therefore, the planned strategy could not be implemented at all.</p>
<p>Great Disparity in Numbers</p>
<p>However, the enemy forces in Nassau Bay were constantly reinforced, and with land and air coordination, they launched a fierce counterattack against our forces. The officers and soldiers of that unit continued their Ashura-like death struggle amidst constant artillery fire, sacrificing themselves for their country. Their strong endurance in battle was evident. Subsequently, as the situation intensified, an order was given on a certain day in a certain month to shorten the front line and retreat to positions near Salamaua, while fortifying the coastal positions. The enemy's firepower and equipment were quite superior, with mortars and heavy mountain guns constantly roaring. Regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy, day or night, the sound of artillery fire rumbled on, and shells rained down. "The enemy's artillery shells are cheap!" one brave soldier exclaimed. How many shells do they have? It's truly admirable. Sometimes, even shells with the fuses removed were sent over. The shells that don't explode but fall after piercing the top of the tent are truly terrifying! However, the enemy only fired when they had to, and when they did, they would uproot primeval forests that had never been touched by an ax, kicking up a sky full of ochre earth. The scene was particularly tragic!</p>
<p>Conversely, our forces, due to a lack of transportation capacity to the front lines, were unable to resupply ammunition and provisions, so they never fired a shot in vain. Moreover, when we fired one shot, we would receive twenty or thirty in return; if we used mortars, they would respond with field and mountain guns; if we used field and mountain guns, they would return the favor with heavy artillery. Therefore, our artillery units could only rely on quality to overcome the enemy's artillery, which relied on quantity. This could be called a "spiritual challenge." Every shell fired by our brave warriors contained the spirit of "one shot, one enemy eliminated." There was even an instance of destroying seven enemy mortar positions with a single shot from our last mountain gun. When the soldiers, amidst their fierce struggle, heard the news that the artillery reinforcement unit commanded by Captain Suzuki had landed in Salamaua amidst towering waves with an unwavering determination to win, and were dreaming of tomorrow's battle in their encampment, they were unexpectedly caught in a heavy bombing raid by a large formation of enemy aircraft, and Captain Suzuki and many of his officers and soldiers sacrificed their lives for the country. It was ultimately difficult to unleash the full potential of this unit with such personnel. Furthermore, reinforcements were not permissible under the present circumstances, especially since the front lines desperately needed artillery support. As a result, the commander of a certain artillery unit made a sorrowful decision. He planned to temporarily disband the unit and distribute its members to other units, in the hope of maximizing the unit’s artillery capabilities.</p>
<p>Winning Through Quality</p>
<p>At that time, the survivors of the unit submitted a blood oath, signed by Sergeant Unosuke Yotsukura and several others, to the commander of a certain artillery unit. The content was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>"When a soldier faces the battlefield, who would care about personal adversity? The unit landed at Salamaua without any loss of personnel or equipment. Moreover, upon receiving the advance unit, the morale of the unit members was extremely high, looking forward to completing their mission in tomorrow's battle. Unexpectedly, they were caught in a heavy bombing raid by enemy aircraft, and unfortunately, lost the unit commander and several comrades-in-arms. However, in order not to betray the teachings of the unit commander, even if only one soldier remains, he will share the fate of the artillery. Therefore, the remaining members, with Lieutenant Kikuchi at the core, are united in spirit, willing to fight to the death for the honor of the unit. Even if the unit has only one artillery piece left, it will certainly fulfill its mission to defeat the enemy, to comfort the spirits of the unit commander and fallen comrades, and to serve the emperor. We are now prepared to carry out tomorrow's orders, and hope that our situation will be understood and that the unit will not be dispersed."</p>
<p>The unit commander, holding the sealed blood oath, could not help but sigh after reading it: "I have never been so moved by the sincerity of my subordinates!" Every word was filled with loyalty and a noble spirit, and its sincerity was enough to move even the gods. Could this not be said to be the essence of the artillery spirit? Just as the first-line ground units were engaged in a desperate battle under the heavy bombardment of enemy artillery and the intense bombing of enemy aircraft, the Jinno unit suddenly joined the battle. The Jinno unit was a well-trained elite force that had been mysteriously appearing and disappearing since landing in Salamaua. They bravely and resolutely charged into the enemy's ranks, crushing them as easily as smashing dry weeds. Their night raids and assaults were very effective, so they once told the chief of staff, "As long as we have a steady supply of food, we have nothing to worry about." Therefore, the enemy deeply resented them. In addition, the Oba suicide squad also penetrated deep into enemy territory, engaging in arduous battles and destroying the enemy's artillery positions.</p>
<p>However, the enemy's counter-offensive momentum in Salamaua was becoming increasingly blatant and aggressive. Looking toward the enemy's positions, one could see Douglas transport planes dropping long, unidentified objects via parachute every day. What exactly were they? This mystery was finally solved after a few days. One day, we learned from an allied pilot that those were medium-caliber 4.5-inch anti-aircraft guns. It turned out that the enemy was transporting anti-aircraft guns by plane! The number of "wells" and "ponds" on the allied positions that resulted from enemy artillery fire was increasing daily. The brave soldiers fighting in the waterlogged trenches were suffering from moisture-related foot ailments, and their condition was heartbreaking, but they were all determined to fight to the death and defend Salamaua.</p>
<p>On a certain day in a certain month, several dozen enemy soldiers infiltrated a gap in the Takahashi unit's position and began building fortifications. They were immediately discovered by Sergeant Miyai. He immediately led six of his subordinates in a brave and ferocious attack, disregarding their own lives. The enemy soldiers were initially caught off guard and thrown into confusion, but seeing that their attackers were few in number, they regained their composure and returned fire with automatic rifles. Sergeant Miyai immediately charged into the enemy's ranks alone, rampaging through their lines. Eventually, his sword broke and his arrows were exhausted, and he died a heroic death. In addition, one other soldier was killed and three were wounded, leaving only Corporal Fukutomi and Private First Class Amada. As the enemy, relying on their superior numbers, counterattacked, the sun had already set without anyone noticing. Corporal Fukutomi and Private First Class Amada took advantage of the cover of darkness to crawl closer to the enemy's position and threw hand grenades. The enemy soldiers, sleeping soundly, were unsure of what was happening and fell into chaos, retreating in a panic. The two of them held the position until reinforcements arrived the next morning, and were therefore praised and commended by their superiors.</p>
<p>Spirit of Attack</p>
<p>On a certain day in a certain month, American forces suddenly landed between the Busu River and the Hopoi River. At 9:00 AM that morning, the wireless suddenly malfunctioned. To our surprise, around 11:00 AM, the sound of rumbling shook the earth, and approximately thirty B-24 and B-17 aircraft flew toward Lae. Soon after, the enemy planes, in formations of three, began a continuous iron bombing, centering on OOO. The intensity of the bombing was truly indescribable. The bombs were time-delayed, detonating after one or two seconds. They were all large objects weighing around 500 kilograms. The bombing caused the earth to shake, and the terrain changed in an instant. The craters formed by the explosions were about 20 meters in diameter and 6-7 meters deep, filled with water like ponds. They were everywhere.</p>
<p>As the night turned to dawn, large ocean liners were spotted far out at sea. Destroyers were guarding the transport ships. Submarines were surfacing. Countless P-38 fighter planes were flying overhead. There was a total of seventy ships. One large ship was later destroyed by our navy planes. One cruiser and four to six transport ships were sunk. In addition, two destroyers were heavily damaged and caught fire, and twenty-seven P-38 fighter planes were shot down. The headquarters has already announced this great victory.</p>
<p>To prevent the enemy's landing force from crossing the Boso River, the machine gun unit was deployed along the river, maintaining strict vigilance, ready to crush any enemy that appeared. A few days later, our field guns and machine guns suddenly roared. All the officers and soldiers were extremely tense. After all, we were outnumbered. Thus, the soldiers who had been groaning in the field hospitals, hearing the sound of the gunfire, all braced themselves and got up. Soldiers leaning on canes and holding guns, officers with wounded arms, and comrades who had lost limbs all rose up together. Who had ever seen such a battle? As long as we have breath, we will fight relentlessly! Moreover, we recognize death on the battlefield as the highest honor for a soldier. What a noble spirit! This is the spirit of relentless attack! (By Special Correspondent Tagata) (Translated from the October 17th *Asahi Shimbun*)</p>

<p>On the still sea, the waves surged and mixed, and pieces of dry wood fell down like shavings. The burning, falling pieces of dry wood were the remains of the U.S. Army's "secret weapon," the P-39 single-engine fighter plane, shot down by our new fighter planes. After intense concentrated bombing, the waves rippled, and at that moment, the enemy's plane was shot down. In early summer, May, I departed from Tokyo, and in early June I arrived at the forward base. Since my arrival, I have seen such fierce battles every day.</p>
<p>The enemy's best fighter plane is the "P-39," and the "P-38" is also formidable. It is a twin-engine, twin-boom fighter plane made by Lockheed, the fastest, for fighter use. There are two types for reconnaissance. When attacking Russell Island, a highly skilled naval pilot, a naval lieutenant, engaged an enemy "P-38" in aerial combat. During the engagement, they climbed, each trying to outclimb the other, while shooting. In such a situation, the one who retreats is sure to be shot down; the key to victory is to head straight for the target. Until now, most enemy pilots were afraid to engage and tried to escape. But at that time, the enemy did not escape, no matter how much they were shot at, and of course we did not escape either. Boom! Boom! The distance gradually shortened. Just when it seemed they were about to collide head-on, the enemy raised the nose of his plane slightly. As a result, the Lieutenant's plane dived under the enemy plane, and they brushed past each other. At that moment, the machine gun fire from the enemy rained down on the Lieutenant's cockpit. Such fierce combat proves that there are very brave people among the enemy pilots.</p>
<p>Enemy Brave But Reckless</p>
<p>Many enemy fighter planes have indeed been shot down. As a country, the United States is gradually weakening here. In fact, the enemy's losses are very severe. As long as we keep shooting them down, the number of fighter planes and submarines at the enemy's base will decrease. However, the enemy keeps replenishing new fighter planes from Guadalcanal and Russell Island. The enemy is certainly getting reinforcements. These new planes are newly manufactured. Naturally, they are flown by new pilots, inexperienced enemies. Because they do not know how formidable we are, they adopt such reckless tactics, the "moving target" tactic. The enemy pilots are probably all students, so-called young calves who are not afraid of tigers. But all they have is speed, which is not at all intimidating to our brave pilots. As soon as their plane is hit, they immediately open their parachutes and bail out, landing on the sea, where they get into rubber rafts, and the enemy's high-speed torpedo boats come and rescue them. The enemy has many high-speed boats operating in certain areas, and any pilots who fall into the sea can be rescued. Seeing this, we cannot help but feel deep resentment.</p>
<p>Night Air Raid Situation</p>
<p>Among the enemy planes that come at night, it seems there are some excellent aviators mixed in. But there are also some cowards among them. Once, three planes were sent to attack the XX base. Because of the thick fog that day, all three enemy planes broke through to the base. In the raid, they split into two planes and one plane. Emerging from the clouds, the two planes and one plane bumped into each other and, as if they were enemies, fired all their weapons at each other upon seeing a plane, staging a self-destructive tragedy. As a result, all three planes were hit and damaged. Such a hilarious incident was truly amusing. The moment of shooting down enemy planes that come at night is a truly magnificent and joyful scene. A huge flying fortress, which had always fired bullets wildly, suddenly turned into a blazing inferno. The enemy's flying fortress, which had never been shot down, was finally shot down. How joyful this was to us! Looking up at the sky, everyone clapped their hands with joy. Although there were many bombings, seeing such a scene was thanks to being at the front line. Once a flying fortress is shot down, the enemy airmen immediately parachute down, and we wait to capture those guys who sneak out of the jungle, and ask them about their situation. It is said that 90% of their pilots are students, aged 23 or 24 to 27 or 28. Some are from Harvard University, some are from the University of Washington. According to the prisoners, 30% of the entire army is suffering from malaria, but quinine, the magic drug for treating this disease, has been taken by the Japanese side, causing the enemy considerable suffering.</p>
<p>The enemy was already suffering, and now they are suffering even more. This can be understood simply by looking at the supply situation. The enemy uses transport planes to carry food and ammunition, and then drops them by parachute. Unfortunately, this cannot last long, because they have to land a large army. No wonder they neglected submarine work. As for the enemy troops' landing situation, it is also pitiful. They always gather their transport ships only when the weather is bad for two or three days, when Japanese planes cannot operate actively. The scale of the landing is quite large. When the large fleet of ships arrives near the destination, it takes two hours to unload the cargo from the rear ships. After the landing is completed, fighter planes patrol the sky, while preparing anti-aircraft gun positions, building air defense trenches, and building an airfield. (Translated by Peng)</p>

<p>— Traveler</p>
<p>Seven years! Surrounded by demons and monsters, sheltered by jackals and wolves, we have lost our great guide to lead us in our struggle. Seven years! Under the shroud of darkness, in the faint dawn, we have lost the guiding light to show us the path we should take. Seven years! In the onslaught of violent winds and crashing waves, we have lost this lone wolf, to hold us fast. You have rested in "eternity" for seven years, but the sound of your "Outcry" forever echoes in our ears, dispelling our "wandering" from losing our way. The "Ah Q" era has long since died. What remains now is an "eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, an era of revenge." What you said before "Seven Years" will be eternally practiced by us, the survivors: "Using flesh and blood to blunt sharp blades, using blood to extinguish flames, to see a bright dawn in the dim light of swords and fire, that is the dawn of a new century."

<h3 id="e57">Song <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>I love song.</p>
<p>When the conductor's baton forcefully cuts through the air, when a tragic song rolls out from the chest of every choir member, my heart beats fiercely. The voices gather in the air to form a whole, and the undulating sounds, moving, inspiring thousands of people, also touch and inspire the singers themselves.</p>
<p>The melody of the soprano section is like a brilliant silver hoop, high-pitched, bright, and gracefully inlaid on the edge of the magnificent song, guiding each section to advance rhythmically, quickly or slowly. Sometimes, like seagulls on the big river, flying to the depths of the white clouds, and then suddenly falling down, nimbly skimming the surface of the water; the singing rises freely, circling smoothly, repeating a moving melody, and suddenly falls and sinks into the waves of the rich male voice section, stirring up some scattered, silver waves on the river.</p>
<p>The alto follows closely, calm and elegant, the clear voice supporting the high pitch of the soprano, completing the necessary supplementation of the harmony. The sound waves tremble, shyly hiding and carefully undulating in the range of the chorus, it stretches out flatly, like the rhythm of a train crossing the desolate wilderness, clearly and solemnly drifting in all directions.</p>
<p>The tenor section moves brightly, like the brilliant sun rising from the east, reddening half the sky. It sings the main melody with the soprano section. Skillful composition techniques arrange it to walk on a winding, discontinuous, high and low road, unfolding a series of surging waves, one chasing the other and flooding forward. It soars in the musical space like an eagle, holding its head high, flapping its two strong giant wings, bravely turning over, and drawing a powerful curve to clearly separate the male and female sections.</p>
<p>Rolling in with a low, magnificent, and solemn sound is the raging tide of the bass section. It is suppressed under the mountains, squeezed out such a melancholy and old sound as if squeezed between the valleys, running a tune that progresses by octaves. The effect of the triad, or even the seventh chord, is thus brought to its ultimate and perfect completion.</p>
<p>If the soprano is like the thriving spring, the alto is like the withered grass and flowers, the cool and refreshing autumn, the tenor is like the vigorous and lush summer, and the bass is like the severe and gloomy winter, then the four-part chorus is a complex synthesis and harmony of the four seasons, with many rich interests.</p>
<p>Like the Yangtze River struggling to surge out of the mountains, a song emanates from the mouths of the singers. Sometimes it is as quiet as a lake after a storm, so clear that it can reflect people; sometimes it is like the sea under a storm, stirring up turbulent waves. Sometimes it is full of energy, shaking with the freedom, satisfaction, and joy, shaking with the triumph and success, shaking with the serene and quiet joy, the sounds dancing and flying, and suddenly turning into a sad, mournful melody, so desolate and miserable, the sounds lengthening, feeling the tremor of enlightenment. Sometimes it is full of anger, passionate and high-spirited, like the long cry of a war horse, like the roar of iron birds, the singing rising step by step, straight into the sky. The conductor's baton suddenly stops, all sounds suddenly cease, falling into silence. At this time, how many dreams, how many emotions, how many hopes are intertwined in people's hearts; this moment of silence after the end of the song contains a sublime artistic charm and a silent sound.</p>
<p>I don't like quiet, and I am even more afraid of loneliness, but I am willing to shut myself up in a narrow room, facing a phonograph and a pile of records, letting it turn and sing some passionate songs, and my heart flies. The four walls of the small room expand around me, and I wander in the vast and boundless, brilliantly illuminated land of music. The songs of Schubert, Verdi, and Tyndall, ballads, cantatas, will give me infinite fantasies and make me long for the hopes of tomorrow more urgently. Of course, I prefer to throw myself into the crowd, raise my head, hold my breath, and listen to the singing of a group of young choir members. In that kind of scene, their songs will shake my heart more violently. Our excellent composers also often give me encouragement and inspiration. In their creations, I can smell the warm breath of the motherland.</p>
<p>I love songs, they make my soul and emotions, polluted by this society, purified and washed. I sincerely thank the composers and singers!</p>
<h3 id="e58">Female Prisoner <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Guan Renfa</p>
<p>Time passed quickly in the Cheng mansion. A year had gone by, and in that year, aside from breastfeeding little Shi in place of her mistress, she couldn't remember anything else.</p>
<p>The Cheng residence was so lively today! Cheng Fu must be incredibly happy. An old man nearing fifty, celebrating the joy of having a son. Today was the first birthday of the little master. How could they not arrange a banquet to celebrate?</p>
<p>Aying, in her heart, was also very happy. She had fed this little master so well, making him fair and plump; this was entirely her merit.</p>
<p>"Aying, bring little Baobao so the guests can take a look." Cheng the wealthy man's kind voice entered Aying's ears. This suggestion was made by a guest surnamed Wang, and with the agreement of the crowd, Cheng the wealthy man didn't refuse. Moreover, he thought, "I have such a good child, truly wonderful."</p>
<p>As Aying carried the little one through the banquet, everyone praised the child's blessed appearance, fair and plump, and gave Aying a reward. When the viewing was over, little Shi had also fallen asleep. Just as she was about to put him down, another auntie handed her a fast letter. She was very anxious; in the past year, the letters from her hometown were all regular mail. This time, the fast letter seemed rather strange. She immediately opened the letter. Inside, two goose feathers stood up. Looking at the letter again, her eyes were filled with golden stars. She fainted. The letter was filled with misfortune, nothing but misfortune. Her husband had contracted typhoid fever and, without money for treatment, had died. Her son, not getting enough milk, had withered and died.</p>
<p>She went mad. She wanted to find her enemy. Where was he? Who was the little one in that cradle over there? Wasn't he her enemy? She immediately rushed over! "Wah! Wah!" "Haha..." She fainted again.</p>
<p>"You ungrateful wretch..." "Ungrateful and treacherous..." "..." A string of curses poured over her, but she continued to laugh madly. She no longer felt comfortable in the Cheng mansion. She was now in a bitter iron cage. Her life, would her life end here?</p>
<h3 id="e59">Father <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Yan</p>
<p>The calendar on the wall had thinned to a small part, but it continued to be torn off page by page. Finally, the clear black characters announced to me: the day to pay the tuition was approaching.</p>
<p>Father's face, day by day, became more gloomy – even gloomier!</p>
<p>Early in the morning, with a hopeful heart, he set off at a quicker pace, bustling under the scorching sun. I understood the motivation and purpose of his journey.</p>
<p>In the evening, dragging his tired, thin body, he slowly stepped into the house and collapsed onto the bed. I looked at him: his complexion was a ghastly pale, and his brows were furrowed even more tightly! I knew that he had again let time pass in vain and had surely wasted many good words and painful, unnatural smiles, and perhaps had suffered no small amount of mockery or embarrassing expressions and glares!</p>
<p>"Ah... Ah!" Continuous, muffled sighs began to echo in this small room.</p>
<p>I feared listening to that monotonous sigh; I couldn't bear to see that defeated face; I also couldn't bear that the elderly him, for our sake -- me, brother, sister -- was enduring hardship!</p>
<p>I was older and should help shoulder some of the burden; but, now? …</p>
<p>I planned a method. But. Heavens! This, is this my original intention? How could I be willing to explain it to Father?</p>
<p>This morning, Father was again sitting silently in his chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. The surrounding noise could not disturb his train of thought, like a meditating old monk or a soldier who had transcended this mortal world. But, was it really for such noble aloofness? Rather, it was clearly that he was completely focused on that evil word, "money"!</p>
<p>When my gaze fell on the melancholy face of the old man, my heart was filled with all kinds of suffering.</p>
<p>Suddenly, brother and sister ran in, carrying a letter high, shouting, "Dad, a letter from school! A letter from school!"</p>
<p>The letter temporarily interrupted Father's train of thought; at the same time, it also attracted my gaze. Yes, this was a letter from school.</p>
<p>With trembling hands, Father seemed to struggle to take out the notice inside.</p>
<p>Brother and sister were on either side, each craning their necks, vying to read. After all, the first to finish reading was Father. However, he still held that mimeographed slip, with a dazed look, just staring at the ceiling in a daze.</p>
<p>"Dad, really, why don't you ever pay our tuition?" Having just finished reading, brother immediately said accusingly.</p>
<p>"..." Father didn't even blink, still sitting as before, without giving him an answer.</p>
<p>After a long time, sister still hadn't understood; she snatched the slip from Father's hand, asking me to explain.</p>
<p>The general meaning of the notice was: if the tuition isn't paid again, they would be expelled!</p>
<p>Then, sister also began to complain to Father. Soon after, tears were rolling down her face, shimmering.</p>
<p>"To... tomorrow we'll pay!" Father still looked at the ceiling, slowly uttering these words.</p>
<p>This immediately made brother and sister turn their tears into smiles; running and jumping again, they disappeared in an instant!</p>
<p>Heavens! Tomorrow? Pay tomorrow? Correct! The words are easy to say, but, the money? Where is the money?</p>
<p>Father began to sigh again.</p>
<p>Tuition… tomorrow… money… sorrow… sigh… all of this encouraged me – finally, it made me resolutely speak out the unwilling solution:</p>
<p>"Dad, I want to go apprentice in business!"</p>
<p>Father was unexpectedly startled: "Go apprentice in business? ... Why don't you want to continue studying?"</p>
<p>"It's not for anything! I just feel that studying doesn't have much meaning!" As I spoke, I turned my head. This insincere statement made me burst into tears.</p>
<p>Finally, Father understood: "Child, don't ever destroy your future foundation for me! Books, you must always read them. Dad suffers because he didn't read enough books; there were several opportunities, but knowing that I was incompetent, I watched as the positions were given to others; otherwise, Dad wouldn't be as poor as I am now! As for the money, you don't need to worry, Dad will find a way! If not, we can sell some things! ..." I couldn't bear to argue; in my heart, I didn't know whether it was bitterness or joy. But, I was uncomfortable! Suddenly, I stood up, ran to the bed, and buried my face in the pillow, crying loudly.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Shanghai Football League is About to Begin Examining the Strength of the Top Seven Teams in Group A East China and Lianyi are the Strongest <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>This year, the Shanghai football scene, due to the Western Football League (originally the Shanghai League) ending and becoming history, is now under the leadership of the Shanghai Football Association, which is on the rise. This epoch-making transformation has not only relieved our teams of the humiliation of being oppressed by the Western League but has also regained the sovereignty lost for decades. Therefore, it leaves a worthy and special page of glory in the history of Chinese football.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Football Association convened an inaugural meeting last month, and subsequently, the first board meeting decided to organize a competition committee and a judging committee to actively promote the work, host the Shanghai Football League to succeed the "Four League Competition," and decided to hold two major cup competitions, the "City Cup" and the "International Cup." It is expected that this year's football season will have an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>
<p>A Total of Fifty Teams Participate</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Football League, it has been set to begin on November 6. It is divided into three groups: A, B, and C. Approved by the competition committee, there are seven teams in Group A, eight teams each in Parts 1 and 2 of Group B, and nine teams in each of Parts 1, 2, and 3 of Group C, for a total of fifty teams joining the competition. It is noted that the previous Western League football participants consisted of only twenty-seven teams in Groups A, B, and C combined. This year, it has almost doubled, showing a thriving atmosphere. In the future, the competition among the heroes and the exciting situations can be imagined.</p>
<p>Changes in Major Players</p>
<p>It is noted that the seven teams in Group A include the strongest and most elite lineups in Shanghai. Among them, the four teams that participated in last year's Four League Competition are Lianyi, East China, Portuguese Business, and Jewish. The Scotto Cup champion St. Francis has merged into St. John's, renamed St. John's United. Three Police (formerly French Police) and Three Provinces have emerged, forming the situation of seven heroes. Among the strengths of the teams, East China and Lianyi are the strongest. However, the lineups of the two teams have had subtle changes this year. Sun Jinshun and Zhang Lingen of Lianyi have returned to their parent team, East China, while Xu Wenkui and Zhang Zhaopeng of East China have joined Lianyi together. Such adjustments are not beneficial to either side. Looking at the current lineup, the shortcomings of both teams remain similar. Lianyi's original illness of relying too much on Zhang Lingen will inevitably be addressed by transferring Qu Yunxiang. In the front line, Xu replacing Sun fills the vacancy, but the movement afterwards creates a situation of four missing one. Therefore, the attacking power is extremely weak. Returning to East China, the weakness of the central defender line is its biggest problem. After this adjustment, the defense has the three musketeers Zhang (Lingen), Zhuang (Youren), and Li (Qing), forming an oversupply situation. The central defender sees Zhang Zhaopeng's departure, but Sun Tiegeng's return should help boost the offensive. However, lacking an A-Kui, the difference is negligible. Therefore, the lineups of these two teams, East China and Lianyi, have undeniable weaknesses, which is a great pity!</p>
<p>Portuguese and Jewish are Mediocre</p>
<p>As for the two four-person strong teams, Portuguese Business and Jewish, their performance in last year's Western League Group A was mediocre. This season, Portuguese Business continues as always. If veteran Kao Zhitannen returns to his old ways, their performance may improve. Jewish, due to the main player Fa Fanxiao joining St. John's United, has a weaker lineup. The above two teams should have no hope of contending for the championship.</p>
<p>Three Police is the Former French Police</p>
<p>The Qiaolian team has emerged this year, possessing all the elite of the Scotto Cup champion St. Francis, such as Pan Liman, Xu Erz, M. Pantoson, Greenburg, Carolie, En and others, plus Jewish's Fa Fanxiao, St. John's pillar Yagov, and Shao Youjun, their military strength is flourishing. In the near future, in the cup, they will compete with Lianyi, which is not easy. Therefore, among this season's four-person teams, this team is the strongest. Three Police (formerly the Third Police) is good at hiring strong and capable men. Veterans like Huang Maoji and Stoff, and young players like Qiu Kuntian, are fierce and brave. What their strength will be will only be seen after the start of the league.</p>
<p>Three Provinces' Skill Progresses Rapidly</p>
<p>Three Provinces is the Xuhui Middle School team. Under the guidance of Wang Yifu, their skill has progressed rapidly, and their spirit of observing discipline and respecting sportsmanship is not seen in current teams. It is hoped that Xuhui can maintain this, and as the team is full of young and energetic youth, if given time, their future is unlimited. However, as it is their first time participating in Group A, they may not be able to compete with the various teams. They should still hold the principle of "not being arrogant in victory and not being discouraged in defeat, and strive forward." We place endless hopes on them!</p>
<p>In addition, the various teams in Groups B and C are the second-tier teams in Shanghai, all participating. When they meet on the battlefield, they will be evenly matched, and heroes will show their skills. There will inevitably be fierce competition and wonderful performances. (Zhang Liang)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Universal Cup Round Gateball Competition Both Men and Women Participate Discussing the Lineups of Each Group <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Round gateball was invented by Qing Nancangjun for youth sports competitions. Since its introduction, it has been extremely popular. This time, Xia Shikui initiated the Universal Cup Round Gateball League. As the name suggests, it is a step to promote this novel sport, complementing Qing Nancangjun's hard work. The league was originally scheduled to be held at Guangxia Middle School on the 17th of this month, but was postponed to the 23rd. It was further postponed a second time due to rain, and it has been set to start next Sunday at the original location. This wonderful game is intentionally teasing the fans, making their desires eager and keen. Taking advantage of this repeated postponement, we visited the strength of each group and briefly recorded it, also as a reference for fans:</p>
<p>Group A</p>
<p>Eight teams have joined, and the strength of each team is quite even, with Qianghua, Four Youth, and Nanyang being the strongest. In addition to the original good players Zhang Shaoqing, Qu Xilin, Kong Guangyi, Du Bensheng, Qianghua has also acquired the sharpshooter Bao Songyuan, adding wings to a tiger. Coupled with the return of Pan Zhongen, serving as goalkeeper, they have an extra layer of protection. Their momentum is overwhelming, giving the impression that the championship belongs to them. The Western Youth team, which brings together the elites of the Giant and Knack teams, is no less threatening than Qianghua. Their understanding of round gateball surpasses the Chinese teams. The team has more than two round gateball practice matches per week, deeply understanding the essence of the game, and having a considerable understanding of running, attacking, and defending. Players such as Tao Bolinji, Sasskin, Kai Milov, and others are ambitious, striving to win the round gateball throne, which is a real worry for Qianghua. Secondly, Nanyang, in addition to the original good players Zhang Banglun, Han Longhai, Fan Qingxian, and Li Zhuang, has also received the assistance of Lu Guyong and Zhang Xiliang. The strength of their lineup shows their meticulous planning. Therefore, the situation in Group A will inevitably become a three-legged race among the above three teams, and the wonderful performances to come can be imagined. The remaining teams such as Tonghua Film, Weiren Team, and White Team, although their strength is slightly weaker, relying on God's favor, are by no means idle teams. Perhaps there will be unexpected situations. After making this prediction, I also look forward to seeing unexpected changes, refreshing our eyes and ears.</p>
<p>Group B</p>
<p>Few have joined. Zhonghua, Qinghua, and Qianghua are stronger, and there is a dark horse, the Jewish team. Originally, they belonged to Group A, but the league authorities, because the team has a history in football and basketball but are participating in round gateball for the first time, downgraded them to Group B. Based on their tall stature and level of basketball skills, they may make the "dark horse" make a splash, and they will be the strong enemy of Western Youth B and Qiangren.</p>
<p>Women's Group</p>
<p>Six teams of heroines are competing, which is a good phenomenon for women's sports. Before this grand event has begun, there should be no pronouncements to reduce the interest of some teams. It is hoped that each team will not be discouraged. Know that winning or losing the championship is originally a kind of reward, and the performance of sportsmanship and virtue is even more important than this. Even more so, at a time when women's sports are being vigorously promoted, it is hoped that each team will do their best to display their skills, and not let down the hard work of the advocates. Therefore, I believe that the women's group will become the world of the Green Team. The Green Team has gathered the strong players of Qixiu, Jingwu, and Aiguo, and has invited the inventor, Qian Xucang, to guide them. Good flowers need green leaves to set them off. It is pleasing to the eye. Their attack has the three tiger generals Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shuzhen, and Li Yunzhi, and their defense has the all-rounders Wang Weizhen, Yan Wen, and Liu Zhenbao. They are complete and lacking nothing, so they should not have difficulty directly attacking the Yellow Dragon. However, the barbarian team Western Youth has a tall stature and great strength, and they practice very hard. Their ambitions should not be underestimated. The emerging Three Provinces team has strong players such as Shi Ruijuan, and they should not be completely ignored. Therefore, this unique competition among the heroines will surely change the tastes of fans and create a lot of highlights. Other teams, such as Puji and Jewish, although their strength is weaker, are all eager to have a good performance. It is truly a feast for our eyes.</p>
<p>The above is only my personal opinion, and I hope that the advanced will give guidance, and I have great expectations! (Mei Bixian)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Wrestling's Great Effects Everyone Should Promote this Excellent Chinese Sport <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>"One can work hard to avoid disease; but one cannot escape death: Dietary supplements can avoid disease, but cannot strengthen the body, the only wonderful way to strengthen the body is exercise, only then will muscles and bones be strong, and internal organs firm." These are words from the book "Scientific Internal Strength Boxing", which has indicated to us that exercise is the only effective way to strengthen the body.</p>
<p>Exercise is Necessary to Strengthen the Body</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the weak long for the strong to be envious and self-satisfied, however, developing a perfect physique through exercise is even more glorious. But those who have just started exercising must not be discouraged if their results are not as ideal as they hoped. You must find out the reason why you cannot get satisfactory results; perhaps the method is wrong, or the exercise is excessive or insufficient; you must also understand that the development of a person's physique is limited, and it can never develop forever. The exercise we usually worry about is only to pursue a perfect physique that meets our own physiological conditions, and not an unlimited desire. We must admit that people with naturally large bones seem to be more convenient and easier to achieve results when they exercise. But it cannot be denied that the method of exercise is more important. If the exercise method you adopt is reasonable, then even if you are a person with small bones, you can still get an extremely healthy body. Here I will start to introduce an excellent exercise method that was originally a national treasure but has gradually declined - wrestling.</p>
<p>Wrestling was Originally Called Jiaodi</p>
<p>Wrestling was originally called Jiaodi, or Shoubo and Sumo, and is also known as Shuai Jiao. It was first discovered in our country during the time of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. At that time, emperors and aristocrats liked this Jiaodi play. Until the end of the Qing Dynasty, this skill was most common. Soldiers of the Eight Banners, especially Mongols, were good at this skill. European and American countries also have wrestling, but it is different from Chinese wrestling, which emphasizes skill. Japanese judo seems to be similar to Chinese wrestling, but its skill seems to be not as profound as Chinese wrestling. Chinese wrestling takes the essence of various boxing techniques. As the saying goes, "Three years of boxing is not as good as one year of wrestling." This means that learning boxing for three years is not as good as learning wrestling for one year. The ingenuity of our boxing techniques is well known. And wrestling is the gathering of the elite of boxing techniques, its depth of skill can be imagined.</p>
<p>Thinking Can be Agile</p>
<p>Wrestling not only gives you a strong physique and broad muscles; it also trains you to be quick in action and agile in thinking, because when two people are wrestling, everyone wants to use skill to control the opponent. Thus, quick actions are produced, and thinking can also be sharpened by this. If you can practice wrestling for a long time, your attitude will also become calm, and your mind will become stable. If you want to compare wrestling to anything, then attacking is like a tiger, defending is like a mountain; being still is like a virgin, moving is like a fleeing rabbit. This sentence could not be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Internal Organs Can Also Be Strengthened</p>
<p>In addition to exercising muscles and bones, wrestling can also strengthen internal organs. The so-called "internal training of breath, external training of muscles, bones, and skin." When practicing wrestling, moving forward, backward, left, right, upward, and downward, combining rigidity and softness, and taking care of all aspects. Therefore, it is a full-body exercise, not a partial exercise. As for practical use, in addition to strengthening the body, it can also be used to defend against enemies. Therefore, wrestling is an excellent sport.</p>
<p>Wrestling Class Has Been Organized</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this skill has almost been lost. Although there are also three or five venues in Shanghai that teach this skill, most are simple and crude. Moreover, most of the people who participate in the practice lack moral cultivation, so wrestling cannot be properly passed down, which is a pity. Now, enlightened people in the Youth Association, in view of this, have organized a wrestling class, and have specially hired the famous wrestling expert Mr. Tong Zhongyi as an advisor, and have also asked the author to join in and serve as a coach. Mr. Tong is a senior wrestling expert and can be called a master. Although he is over sixty years old, he is energetic and his bravery has not diminished over the years. According to Mr. Tong, this is the result of his decades of wrestling practice. From this, it can be seen that wrestling can not only strengthen the body and defend against enemies, but also can enjoy a long life. (The author also has several old friends, all over seventy years old, who are strong and healthy, and they all maintain daily exercise), this cannot be denied. As for the author, it is only through the Youth Association's opportunity to promote sports that I am promoting the wrestling movement, in order to preserve the national essence forever, and to achieve the goal of strengthening the country and strengthening the people. However, the author's own strength is limited, and I hope that people with high aspirations will promote it more, then it will be fortunate!</p>

<p>Nineteen. Elbow Exercise</p>
<p>Exercise One</p>
<p>The left hand is at the side, the left arm is open, the body leans to the left, and at the same time, the right arm is raised until the elbow is level with the shoulder. Use force on the upper arm to make the forearm and hand swing back and forth, but the forearm looks like a machine, and its movement is not autonomous.</p>
<p>Elbow exercise: Left hand on hip; right arm raised; hand swings back and forth; rest.</p>
<p>Note: Continue exercising for a few seconds, rest for a moment, then exercise again, then rest again.</p>
<p>Exercise Two</p>
<p>The right hand is at the side, the right arm is open. The body bends to the right, and at the same time, the right arm is raised until the elbow is level with the shoulder. Use force on the upper arm to make the forearm and hand swing back and forth, but the forearm looks like a machine, and its movement is not autonomous.</p>
<p>Elbow exercise: Right hand on hip; left arm raised; hand swings back and forth; rest.</p>
<p>Note: Continue exercising for a few seconds, rest for a moment, then exercise again, then rest again.</p>
<p>Twenty. Shoulder Exercise</p>
<p>Exercise One</p>
<p>Both arms hang down naturally, like machines, without vitality. Apply power to the chest and shoulders. The body suddenly turns to the left, the movement must be sudden when turning. The arms swing freely, and the body returns to its original position. After the hands stop swinging, make a second sudden turn.</p>
<p>Shoulder exercise: Sudden turn to the left, rest.</p>
