<h3>現實的物價問題</h3>
<p>近來本市的燃料問題，發生嚴重恐慌，煤球的限價與黑市價，相差數倍，其次如柴炭煤塊無一不是拔步飛騰。愈是一日三市的上　，一般人愈是力為搜救，每與居家住戶接觸，莫不為此而焦慮，莫不為此而牢　。其者怨天尤人，切　詛咒。</p>
<p>燃料上　之外，白米黑市也在節節上昇，於是菜飯館的價目裏，天天在修正，一切物價也步　前進。所以。在本月以來，尤其這一周間，如果　負生活　子者，一定感覺壓力愈重，威脅愈大的</p>
<p>人們要求生存，當然需要飮食，「巧婦難為無米之炊」，「生米不能成熟飯」，因此，米與柴就絕對的成為人們生存上的必需品。如果米與柴成了問題，就是人們主存要求成了問題，在這種情形之下，還配談其他的問題嗎？</p>
<p>我們一向主張人民生活，必先使之安定，幾在戰時，祇能使一般生活水準降低，苦得平均。但目前上海，米煤油穗等生活必需品，名義上雖有配給，而實際上敵量不足，因之發生黑市，而黑市原無徑準，畸形上漲，於是有錢者尙可向黑市取給，初無恐慌；但無錢者望黑市而卻步，挨餓忍　，生少雜　。上海五百萬人口中，貪苦者究占大多數，對此黑市物價的沒無標　，部受直接的壓迫。我們愿意大　疾呼地請求的關當局，注視最現實的民生物價問題，迅　緊急對策。我們　協如次：</p>
<p>燃料為民生必需品中最主要之一種，絕對不許黑市之狂漲，過去各種　價暴漲時，惟煤球一項上漲最緩，其原因當在數量供給充分。最近突然發生恐慌，共主要原因，當局應卽澈底調查。如因來源阻滯，則須設法疏通。同時，限制享受所耗煤斤，例如旅館酒店公寓等等水汀火壚用煤，移之以配給與平民生活所需。熟水店飯店之配給煤，應重要於酒菜館。並切實實施戶口配給　法，寧可依照實施　增配給官價，配給水浪務須適合最　需要。現在市　既已統一，主管部份即應統籌辦理。</p>
<p>米價黑市之有增無已，不得不歸咎於配給米之減量與延期，而減量延期之責任，主管機關尤未便　卸。米　統制委員會成立數月，不必分析其工作情形，僅以近數月配給米德實施相衡，其功過自有定　，　　　　人，歷事三閱月，致富國　數萬萬元，而米　配給　　，深信　每個　民雖欲無言，其奈情急何？茲已不能　　坐誤，一切坐而言這都可不必，應迅速　配給之「準期」　「足量」上打算，取　於大衆。</p>
<p>一切物價之上漲，經濟與各有　當局應嚴切注意，視為本身之責任，不能　手無策。管理物價有關係之各　構，彼此之間必須取得　繫，共同硏究原因所在，商討對策，忠實執行。</p>
<p>總之，物價問題，決不是隨便便所能動決的，非有決心毅力為民衆服務的精神不為功。同時，我們希望盟邦當局竭力協助，便及早得到合理調整，中國民生之幸，卽是中日合作前途之幸。</p>

<h3>對公司增資升値　實部訂限制辦法　姜次長發表談話禪明意義</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　實業部為維護公司基礎，使公司增資升値，井於適當限度，藉免濫於利用起見，特概訂公司增資登記限制暫行辦法，巳呈奉行政院核准，公布施行。茲誌該部美次長談話，及公司增資登記限制暫行辦法於后：　姜次長談話　近來上海各地公司工厰，向本部甲請增加資本，變更登記者，日見甚多。增資方式一不夕下列諸站：一為現金。此外尙有一股升作數股，採取所謂升股辦法者。其第一種方式，自表面觀之，對於扶助工商，增加生產，繁榮社會·固屬良好現象。但投資之運用，必須與各種企業之進展相配合，始能獲得正當之效用。否則難免因不必要之增資·趨向於變態之經營·次則成立已久之公司工廠，共資產如房屋地產機器生財等之價値，旣非昔此，提價增股。自無不合。惟其股票價値所以有今日之高漲，蓋因其原有資產之殷實，如對其資產升値比率，不加相當限制，任憑高估價額，提升作股，不僅有刺激其他物價上漲之虞，且一旦物價趨平，公司資產表面上復存龐大之數字，實際基礎空虛。不獨其股票價値隨之眨落，公司基礎，亦將動搖。此外升股辦法，亦屬於法無據。本部對於公司負有監督之貴，自屬不　坐視。為保護公司基礎，維持社會經濟，經過際　訪，權衡利害。爰擬定公司增資登記限制暫行辦法，呈舉行政院核准，即日公布施行。本法主要在使增資升値，各於適常限度，藉免　濫與利用幷非完全禁阻，希望產業界明瞭政府意旨所在，全面協力一，運用資金於正常增加生產之途，以安民生，亦即所以自固基礎也。</p>
<p>公司增資登記限制暫行辦法　　凡公司無論有限無　限或兩合組織，其增資登記，除依公司登記規則，公司法，公司法施行法，及金融機關另有特別規定者外，均依本辦法辦理之。　凡公司增資，應申述增資理由及認股辦法，呈請地方主管官署，轉呈實業部核准。其未經核准者，不得增資。但經主管官署，應事實之必要，令飭增資者，不在此限。　凡公司增資，應受下列各項之限制：１公司未呈准登記核發執照者，不得增資。２公司於年之內，不得兩度增資。３公司增資，不得以咨物原料等依値作股。４公司增資，其成立在兩年以上者，得以營業上使用之房屋地產機器生財升値作股，其升値價額，不得超過原價一倍，並應將固右資產原價證明文件，會計師查賬證明文件，歷屆資產負債表，及營業報告書等，一併呈核。必要時由部派員，或令飭當地主管官署査騐但金融機關之增資，除經財政部特許者外，概不得以金錢以外之財產升値作股。５公司增値，不得以饋贈酬勞等類辦法作股。６公司增資，除依本條第四項升値作股老外，不得以其他升股辦法作股。　凡公司增資於本辦法施行前·呈請地方主管官署或實業部變更登記者，不受本辦法之限制。　本辦法自公布日施行。</p>

<h3>敵方總反攻的崩潰　日本大本營海軍報道課長栗原大佐陸軍報道課長松村大佐對談</h3>
<h3>（續十二月九日第二版）　前綫拼命，後方生產</h3>
<p>松村大佐</p>
<p>在此猛烈的戰爭下，日本總得攔截來自南方的三大反攻，尤其是現在吃緊之處的反攻，非將它攔同去不可。因此，先前所說的飛機大增產，以及加强軍事生產力，實此任何事情重要。再則，國民士氣的昻揚也很要緊。此外，戰局旣已如此緊張，我們在國內則舉國一致，在大東亞則結集大東亞諸民族，我想實在是　要緊的大事了。</p>
<p>「舉國一致」這句話，每逢國家有事之秋，雖常常提到，但我想從沒有像今日這樣重要的時候了。做到「舉國一致」，最要緊的還在於陸海軍的打成一片。在國內，則大家携手同心，發揮總力到最高度：在大東亞，則各民族相倚相扶，奮力擊减英美。簡而言之，就是一億的團結和十億的結集。</p>
<p>栗原大佐</p>
<p>這雖是我個人的持論，但我在以前也會硏究過總力戰。我感覺到，這次的戰局漸漸發展，巳成眞正德總力戰了。從經濟方面看，這次戰爭是大消耗戰。在實行這大消耗戰時，為了維持前綫的戰力，補給是很重要的。爲了補給起見，國內便非力事生產不可。想到這事，可知前綫的將士，和為未為</p>
<p>為維持戰力而補充前綫消耗戰的補給，以及為實施補給而生產。三者缺一便難繼續戰爭。</p>
<p>這種關係，我常　之為發射大砲的砲手，搬運砲彈的運彈兵，以及將砲彈交給運彈兵的彈藥庫員的關係。這三者，在海軍中都認之為戰鬥負。戰爭恰恰與此相常。前方將士是砲手：運輸種種軍需品，燃料，兵器的船員是運彈兵；生產武器的國民全體便是彈藥庫員。如此想來，前綫的將士，船員與從事生產的全體國民，無論誰都是戰鬥員。我想，這不是和東條首相所說的「一億戰門配置」很符合嗎？</p>
<p>換言之，這一次的戰爭，國家全體和前綫的將士固不必說，就是一切人等也可說是以同一資格從事戰爭的。因此，我們這批在後方的人所不得不深深反省的事，就是前綫將士——例如阿茲島守兵那樣出力時，為什麼同樣是大和民族的我們這班在後方的人，不更認眞一些呢？過去，日本人一講到國雖，所有的人便都把自己的生命奉獻國家。這是日本人正當的態度。如果好好地討論這次戰爭的本質，國民全體便應該以眞的日本人的姿態認眞貫徹此戰。倘若大家都能忘掉自己以赴國難，那末，才可以說在內容方面也樹立所謂不敗的體制了。</p>
<p>我們常常說到道義之戰，也說因為是道義之戰，所以勝了。我想，確是如此。原來，因為是道義之戰，所以從事此戰的全體國民也就是履行道義。在行道義之時，旣沒有摩擦，也沒有嫉視，更無陰險黑暗，大家都是親睦和氣的。陸海軍當然是和睦的，國民全體也是親和的。這種和的努力，結果於遂行戰爭這一點，於是戰爭勝了。</p>
<p>這種道義之戰，換一句話說，便是所謂「聖戰」。是聖戰，所以勝了。這才是日本國民所能說的。想到了聖戰時，實在沒有考慮自己生命納必要。忘掉一切而殉國；這樣，戰爭就勝了。假使忘掉這前提，忘掉這階段，祇是口裏喊喊「是道義之戰所以勝了」，而實際上却無道義之行，那才糟糕了！</p>
<p>國內最近是　益强化了。國民都在實行着道義。國民已響應九月十四日東條首相的呼聲而奮起了。這就是國民明白知道這個前提的綠故。希望在這前提之下，更忘一身，全體國民成為渾然一體，向前邁進，我是這樣想着的。</p>
<p>松村大佐</p>
<p>最近，學生們也康慨激昻地就征了。我想這種事實也是國民徹底了解戰爭實體的一種表現。</p>
<p>栗原大佐</p>
<p>學生們那樣慷慨蹶起，我想正因為他們巳辨淸了戰爭的本質吧。學生已與戰爭合為一體啦！現在與戰爭合而為一的，第一不必說當然是前綫將士，其次我想就是這班學生了。</p>
<p>然而，這班學生也不是特別從大本營得到詳盡的戰訉，而且朝日新聞的電訊和特為也不是單對學生的。反之，學生們因為忙於用功求學，並不詳觀戰局。但是他們知道「今日正是我們起來的時候了」。這就是日本國民全體非起來不可的日本國民眞姿態的表現。（翔：譯自十二月五日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>稽諸「戰時經濟政策綱領」，其關於節約消費者，凡與軍需有關之民需物資，應獎勵代用品之製造，或代用原料之獲得；各種高貴品及奢侈品之生產，應予以限制或禁止；一切不必要之消費，應予以取締；逐漸並分別實施定額配給制度。試問以上所述諸點，是否已經切實推行？則代用品之製造，鮮有所聞，奢侈品之生產，依然如故，不必要之消費，不勝枚舉，定額配給制度，尙未澈底。苟欲達到節約消費所期的效果，則在實施方面，必須根據，「戰時經濟政策綱領」，全面推行，甚至强制執行，亦無不可，若僅用「頭痛治頭，脚痛治脚」的辦法來厲行節約，似乎還是不夠澈底罷。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>八</p>
<p>頂柱倒折了。這在谷的家庭，是怎樣嚴重的問題，一家人現在都深刻的感覺到了。死去了的眞吉，事實上，是隻手支撑了家庭·和店舖內外的一切，但是，遺族們感到的空虛，不僅僅是失去了一個購買販賣米穀和雜貨的負責者——，並不是那樣的性質。</p>
<p>（爸爸沒有了）</p>
<p>今年剛五歲的末雄所感到的空虛，也就是全家族中每個人德心境。</p>
<p>尤其是若子所受的打擊更大。在任何塲合，他不是在丈失面前僭越的女人。手雖然巳像打榨球的破手套般，還是不斷地勞動着，那終究是丈夫的好幫手。她悶聲不嚮地，體貼專默的丈夫的心境，養育子女，在店舖中勞　着。因此，那女人等於丟了舵的舟一樣？</p>
<p>店舖怎麽辦呢？二十六歲的春子，二十三歲的滿子，怎麽辦呢？眞人，末雄，怎樣養大起來？</p>
<p>（無論怎樣，總得想方法啊？）</p>
<p>那女人無論她做得到做不到，祇有負起一切現實的重担來。</p>
<p>如其是土族人家的妻子，則在薩摩那地方，若子就得要把孩子們　集在父親的篡位面前，毅然吩咐些什麽。可是她不那麽做，祗在首其完了的第二天，繫起了丈夫遺下來的厚的團裙，默默地，比以前還要加幾倍地，開始勞動着。和當代用敎　的眞一郞，說要待在店裏幫忙，　若子搖搖頭。</p>
<p>由於母親的本能，她知道兒子們的道路。不適於店內的工作。他們應該走他們的道路。以同樣的理由，他接受了四告的請求。兄弟們中間最溫順的四吉，在　兒島商業學校念了二年書，就輟學在店舖內照顧。像眞人面貌一樣的他，一點也沒有不平，脫掉了制服，立在春米機的傍邊。</p>
<p>女人更多，自從錯過了婚期的長女春子起，以至十六歲得北子，各有各的職務。這樣，谷價位的新體制，就開始了。</p>
<p>不久，孩子們忘掉了沒有父親的空虛。因為谷家不知道在什麽時候又豎起一根新的頂柱來了。若子就是那柱子。她雖然不是巾幗英雄，也不是精幹的母親，但孩子的本能的信賴，牢固地繫在她身上。</p>

<h3>The Realistic Problem of Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, the fuel issue in this city has caused severe panic. The difference between the controlled price and the black market price of coal briquettes is several times over. Secondly, firewood, charcoal, and coal chunks are all soaring. The more prices rise three times a day, the more people try their best to find ways to cope, and everyone they encounter is anxious and complaining about it. Some even blame heaven and curse people.</p>
<p>Besides fuel price increases, the black market price of white rice is also rising steadily. Consequently, the prices at restaurants are being revised daily, and all commodity prices are moving forward in step. Therefore, since the beginning of this month, especially in the past week, anyone bearing the burden of daily life must feel increasing pressure and a greater threat.</p>
<p>People need food to survive. "Even the cleverest housewife can't cook without rice," and "raw rice cannot be cooked into a meal." Therefore, rice and firewood are absolutely essential for people's survival. If rice and firewood become a problem, it means people's basic survival needs have become a problem. In this situation, is it appropriate to discuss other issues?</p>
<p>We have always advocated that people's lives must first be stabilized. Even during wartime, only the general standard of living should be lowered so that everyone suffers equally. However, in Shanghai today, essential commodities such as rice, coal, and oil are nominally rationed, but the actual amount is insufficient, leading to the emergence of black markets. And since black markets have no set prices, prices rise abnormally. Thus, those with money can still obtain supplies from the black market without panic, but those without money are deterred by the black market, suffering hunger and hardship. The poor account for the majority of Shanghai's five million population, and they are directly oppressed by these uncontrolled black market prices. We would like to loudly and urgently appeal to the relevant authorities to pay attention to the most realistic problem of people's livelihood, commodity prices, and to implement emergency countermeasures quickly. Our suggestions are as follows:</p>
<p>Fuel is one of the most essential commodities for people's livelihood, and its black market prices should absolutely not be allowed to rise wildly. In the past, when various prices soared, coal briquettes were the slowest to rise, which was due to a sufficient supply. The recent sudden panic requires the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation of the main reasons. If the source of supply is blocked, efforts must be made to clear the way. At the same time, limit the amount of coal consumed by entertainment places, such as hotels, apartments, etc., for heating, and divert it to meet the needs of ordinary people's lives. The allocation of coal to cooked water shops and restaurants should be prioritized over that to bars and eateries. Furthermore, the household rationing method should be earnestly implemented. It is preferable to increase the official allocation price according to actual needs, and the allocation amount must be suitable for the most urgent needs. Now that the municipal government has been unified, the responsible departments should make overall arrangements.</p>
<p>The continuous rise of rice prices in the black market can only be attributed to the reduction and delay of rice rations, and the responsible authorities cannot shirk responsibility for the reduction and delay. The Rice Control Committee has been established for several months. Without analyzing its work, merely comparing the implementation of rice rations in recent months, its merits and demerits will be self-evident. Someone enriched the country by tens of thousands of yuan in three months, while the rice allocation was neglected. I believe that although every citizen wants to remain silent, how can they endure their urgent situation? We can no longer sit idly by and make mistakes. All empty talk is unnecessary. We should quickly plan for the "punctual" and "sufficient" allocation of rations to satisfy the public.</p>
<p>The relevant economic and other authorities should pay close attention to the rise in all commodity prices, regarding it as their own responsibility and not remaining helpless. Various organizations related to price control must establish close ties with each other, jointly research the causes, discuss countermeasures, and faithfully implement them.</p>
<p>In short, the problem of commodity prices cannot be solved casually. It requires a spirit of determination and perseverance to serve the people. At the same time, we hope that the Allied authorities will do their best to assist in achieving a reasonable adjustment as soon as possible. The well-being of the Chinese people is the good fortune of the future of Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<h3>Elite Japanese Naval Air Unit in White Book Bombs Calcutta, Giving the Anti-Axis Powers a Great Shock</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese air unit recently conducted a large-scale bombing of Calcutta in a white book fashion, which seems to have given the anti-Axis camp a great shock. According to a telegram from Calcutta, the commander of the US 14th Air Force, Doolittle, stated that the Japanese army had never openly bombed Calcutta before. This bombing shows that the Japanese army has the ability to attack Calcutta. The Japanese army seemed to have used elite units, or naval air units taking off from land bases, to participate in this bombing, and said that they used even more excellent fighters and bombers.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain base on the Burma front, on the afternoon of the 13th, the Japanese army air unit, with a combination of various bombers, launched a large-scale attack on the Tinsukia enemy airfield, strafing the enemy planes stationed there with machine guns, completely destroying them. It also engaged in fierce aerial combat with about 30 enemy (P-61) and (P-40) aircraft that intercepted them, resulting in the Japanese aircraft shooting down five (P-40) aircraft (two unconfirmed), ten (P-61) aircraft (four unconfirmed), and one Spitfire fighter. It burned four large enemy aircraft, destroyed five large aircraft, and six small aircraft, totaling thirty-one aircraft. The Japanese side's losses totaled seven aircraft that did not return from the bombing.</p>
<h3>The Chongqing Army on the Indo-Burmese Border Shows Signs of Wavering; Japanese Aircraft Assist in Combat with Great Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - A telegram from the northernmost front of the Burma-India border on the 15th stated that the Japanese army in the Hugong Valley area of northern Burma, after realizing that the war situation was ripe, suddenly launched an attack on the Chongqing (Yu) army on the front line on the morning of November 30th. The Chongqing army relied on air transport for supplies and resisted stubbornly. In this area, the rainy season has ended, and the newly formed 38th Division of the Chongqing army, under the command of American officers, moved southeastward in early October, constantly maneuvering on the Burma-India border. On October 31st, it began a counterattack, using a certain place as a base. At the same time, it dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle. It is learned that since Japan implemented its new policy toward China, although the Chongqing side's resistance was weakening, it still had not given up completely. Seduced by the sweet words of the British and American forces to open the Yunnan-Burma Road, it continuously sent troops to India, serving as sacrifices for the British and Americans. The following is the battle situation in this area since the end of October this year: First, in a certain area, the Chongqing army, under the command of American officers, was attacked by the Japanese army from October to November. However, the newly formed troops reached a point two to three hundred meters away from the Japanese army's base on November 6th. On the night of the 20th, the Japanese army attacked a certain location by surprise, attacking one side while forcing the rear, and on the night of the 22nd, it attacked the Chongqing army's headquarters, defeating them. In this night attack, it captured an American supervising officer with the rank of lieutenant colonel and several Chongqing soldiers. Also, in a certain area, the Japanese army gradually pressured the Chongqing army, waiting for an opportunity to annihilate it. Furthermore, in a certain area, since the beginning of November, the Chongqing army has been engaging in reconnaissance on one hand and repeatedly attacking the Japanese army's positions on the other. However, a certain unit of the Japanese army suddenly launched an attack on the evening of the 11th, and south of a certain river, it repelled the Chongqing army and occupied a Cham village. Moreover, the Chongqing army had built a defensive position near the Kachin village. However, a certain unit of the Japanese army crossed a certain river on the night of the 21st, flanking the Chongqing army and launching an attack. The Chongqing army, in addition to bombarding the first line of the Japanese army with artillery fire, also used aircraft to provide cover and resisted stubbornly. On the afternoon of the 22nd, it launched another attack under the cover of mortar fire, but was repelled by the Japanese army. On the 25th, a Japanese army unit launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing army on the front line, seizing its position, and the Chongqing army retreated. However, it continued to maneuver, and the Japanese army, in order to completely annihilate it, launched an attack at dawn on the 27th. On the 29th, a Chongqing army lieutenant and others surrendered to the Japanese army. The enemy army is currently in a state of wavering.</p>
<p>Air Transport Route to Chongqing Bombed; Enemy Aircraft Losses Reach 70</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to reports, the Japanese army in Burma attacked the Chongqing army's China-India air transport route five times this year on October 13, 23, and 27, and December 10 and 13. The war results obtained were as follows: Eleven transport aircraft (PC13) shot down, one (B-25) type, one (B-24) type, twelve (P-40) types (three unconfirmed), eleven (P-51) types (four unconfirmed), one Spitfire fighter, totaling thirty-seven aircraft. Approximately thirty large aircraft and six small aircraft were destroyed. The Japanese side lost ten aircraft.</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Lingling</h3>
<p>Hankou, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army air force stationed in China, on the 14th, dispatched a combined formation of dozens of fighter-bombers to the Lingling airfield, strafing fourteen or fifteen American aircraft parked on the ground with machine guns, destroying eleven of them, including eight (P-40) types, one (P-31) type, and two (B-25) types. All Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.</p>
<p>Hankou, 15th (Central News Agency) - On the evening of the 13th at around 9 pm, seven American (B-25) aircraft came to Wuchang twice.

<h3>Association of Students Studying in Japan to be Established on the 17th</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - In order to warmly care for students from various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere studying in Japan and to have them live in warm Japanese families, the Association of Students Studying in Japan has been established. The founding ceremony will be held at noon on the 17th at the Bunjin Kaikan Hall.

<h3>Indian National Army Moves to Burma, Reaching a Landmark Stage; Approaching the Date of Advancing to the Border</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Indian National Army has begun to advance towards the India-Burma border. In order to understand the Indian National Army's belief in the independence movement and the situation of the Burmese and Indian people's support, the reporter specifically interviewed Lieutenant Colonel Alagappan, the acting Indian Independence President and senior officer of the Indian National Army. The question and answer session is as follows: (Question) What is the situation of the Indian National Army's advance? (Answer) The independence movement engaged in by the National Army, due to the decision of the Indian Provisional Government, has reached a landmark stage in its transfer to Burma. Comrades in a certain place are waiting for an opportunity to move out. When the Burmese and Indian people heard that the National Army's advance was imminent, they were also excited, donating tens of thousands of rupees as a real fund for the independence movement, and providing various materials necessary for other combat operations. Indians in Malaya are also vigorously supporting the National Army. Our National Army adopts a policy of elite troops, and its morale is high. They are all eager to go to the front line as soon as possible and quickly break through the border. (Question) When the Indian border is broken through, to what extent will the Indian soldiers and the general public respond, you are sure? (Answer) Our army is fundamentally different from the troops recruited in India by the British. We are confident that one division of our army can easily defeat ten or even fifteen divisions of British and American Indian troops. All Indians know that Mr. Bose has now risen. As the commander of the independent National Army, it is clear that as soon as our independent tricolor flag is waved, the Indian soldiers will unconditionally stop resisting and surrender, and the public will rise up to cooperate. (Question) What is your view of the current situation in India? (Answer) India's current political situation is in imminent danger, and it is about to collapse. The lives of the general public are also extremely precarious. The Indian army has heard of Burma's independence and the National Army's imminent advance, and it has become increasingly unstable. Tens of thousands of soldiers are deserting, and many are defecting to Mr. Bose. Indian spies repeatedly sent by the British have also turned to our side. These Indians shed their previous Indian environment and will restore their original appearance. (Question) What are your expectations of the Japanese people? (Answer) India's pursuit of independence is the pursuit of independence for all of Asia. Japan and India continue to maintain friendly relations, and under the ideal of completing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, they provide assistance to India. In order to repay this, we also vow to contribute to the permanent co-prosperity of East Asia.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - In order to maintain the foundation of companies and to allow companies to increase capital and appreciate within appropriate limits, and to prevent abuse, the Ministry of Industry has drafted temporary measures to restrict company capital increase registration. It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgated for implementation. The statement of Vice Minister Jiang of the Ministry and the temporary measures to restrict company capital increase registration are recorded below: Jiang's Statement Recently, many companies and factories in Shanghai and other places have applied to the Ministry to increase capital and change registration. The methods of increasing capital are generally as follows: One is cash. In addition, there is also the method of raising one share into several shares, the so-called stock raising method. From the surface, the first method is a good phenomenon for supporting industry and commerce, increasing production, and prospering society. However, the use of investment must be coordinated with the progress of various enterprises to achieve proper results. Otherwise, unnecessary capital increases may lead to abnormal operations. Secondly, the value of the assets of companies and factories that have been established for a long time, such as houses, real estate, machinery, and other assets, is no longer what it used to be, and it is reasonable to increase prices and increase shares. However, the reason why the value of its stock is so high today is due to the solidity of its original assets. If the appreciation ratio of its assets is not properly restricted, and the amount of high valuation is allowed to be raised into shares, it will not only risk stimulating other price increases, but also once prices become balanced, the company's assets will have a huge number on the surface, but the actual foundation will be empty. Not only will the value of its stock depreciate, but also the foundation of the company will be shaken. In addition, the method of stock raising is also legally unfounded. The Ministry has the responsibility to supervise the company and will not sit idly by. In order to protect the foundation of the company and maintain social economy, after careful visits and weighing the pros and cons, we drafted the temporary measures to restrict company capital increase registration and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The main purpose of this law is to make capital increases and appreciation within appropriate limits, to prevent abuse and utilization, not to completely prohibit them. We hope that the industrial circles will understand the government's intention and fully cooperate to use funds in the normal way to increase production, so as to stabilize people's livelihood and consolidate their foundation.</p>
<p>Temporary Measures to Restrict Company Capital Increase Registration All companies, whether limited, unlimited, or partnerships, whose capital increase registration, in addition to complying with the company registration rules, company law, company law implementation law, and special regulations for financial institutions, shall be handled in accordance with these measures. All companies that increase capital shall state the reasons for the capital increase and the share subscription methods, and submit them to the local competent authorities for transfer to the Ministry of Industry for approval. Those who have not been approved shall not increase capital. However, those who have been ordered to increase capital by the competent authorities due to factual needs are not subject to this restriction. All companies that increase capital shall be subject to the following restrictions: 1. Companies that have not applied for registration and obtained a license shall not increase capital. 2. Companies shall not increase capital twice within a year. 3. Companies shall not use materials, raw materials, etc. as shares based on their value to increase capital. 4. Companies that increase capital and have been established for more than two years may use houses, real estate, machinery, and other assets used in business to increase capital, but the appreciated value shall not exceed one time the original price, and the original price certification documents, accountant's audit certification documents, asset liability tables of previous years, and business reports shall be submitted for verification. When necessary, the ministry shall send personnel or order the local competent authorities to verify them, but the capital increase of financial institutions, unless specially permitted by the Ministry of Finance, shall not be made by appreciating property other than money. 5. Companies shall not use donations, rewards, or other similar methods to increase capital. 6. Companies shall not use other stock raising methods to increase capital, except for the appreciation and stock raising under Item 4 of this article. All companies that increased capital before the implementation of these measures and applied to the local competent authorities or the Ministry of Industry to change registration are not subject to these measures. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>Germany Vigorously Attacks Hull's Speech; European Small Nations Should Be Wary</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a Reuters dispatch, a German Foreign Ministry spokesperson declared that U.S. Secretary of State Hull's speech to Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania has exceeded the scope of his authority, with the sole purpose of luring small and weak nations into the arms of the Soviet Union. Since the Moscow and Tehran conferences, Southeast European countries that the anti-Axis powers wish to place within their sphere of influence are now increasingly clearly within the Soviet sphere of influence. The spokesperson continued, saying that the Soviet-Czech pact can also be seen as a concession by Britain and America to Soviet demands, as the Soviet Union's political assistance to others will inevitably be the same as what Finland previously encountered. The Soviet Union's dispatch of a military delegation to the newly established Yugoslav partisan government also demonstrates the Soviet Union's policy that it intends to implement in Europe, and this action is supported by Britain and America.</p>

Today, the German fortress line from the Atlantic to the French Mediterranean coast has extended to the Italian coast. Our army, based on the experience and lessons learned from past enemy landing operations, is engaged in defensive training. Therefore, both the coastal defense forces and the fresh troops on standby in the rear are first-class elite soldiers. In addition, the importance of concentrated firepower has also been noted. The heavy artillery of the coastal defense force can now concentrate firepower to defend against the enemy's attack.</p>
<h3>The Collapse of the Enemy's General Counteroffensive - Dialogue Between Navy Press Section Chief Colonel Kurihara and Army Press Section Chief Colonel Matsumura of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters</h3>
<h3>(Continued from the Second Edition of December 9th) - Desperate on the Front Lines, Production in the Rear</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsumura:</p>
<p>In this fierce war, Japan must intercept the three major counteroffensives from the south, especially the counteroffensive where the situation is currently tight, and must stop it. Therefore, the previously mentioned large increase in aircraft production and strengthening of military production capacity is more important than anything else. Furthermore, the morale of the people is also very important. In addition, with the war situation already so tense, we must unite as a country domestically, and unite the nations of Greater East Asia in Greater East Asia. I think these are very important matters.</p>
<p>The phrase "unity of the nation" is often mentioned when the country is in times of trouble, but I think there has never been a time as important as today. To achieve "unity of the nation," the most important thing is for the army and navy to work together as one. Domestically, everyone should join hands and exert their total strength to the highest degree. In Greater East Asia, all nations should support each other and strive to defeat Britain and America. In short, it is the unity of 100 million and the gathering of one billion.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara:</p>
<p>This is just my personal opinion, but I have studied total war before. I feel that this war is gradually developing and has become a true total war. From an economic point of view, this war is a war of attrition. When implementing this large-scale war of attrition, it is very important to maintain the combat power of the front lines. For the sake of supplies, the country must devote itself to production. Thinking about this, it can be known that the soldiers on the front lines and those who have not yet</p>
<p>The supply to maintain combat power and replenish the war of attrition on the front lines, and the production for the implementation of supply. It is difficult to continue the war without any of the three.</p>
<p>I often compare this relationship to the relationship between the gunner firing the cannon, the ammunition bearer transporting the shells, and the ammunition depot worker handing the shells to the ammunition bearer. These three are recognized as combat by the navy. War is just like this. The soldiers on the front lines are the gunners; the sailors transporting various military supplies, fuel, and weapons are the ammunition bearers; the entire nation producing weapons is the ammunition depot worker. Thinking this way, the soldiers on the front lines, the sailors, and the entire nation engaged in production are all combatants. I think, doesn't this align with Prime Minister Tojo's "100 million combat deployment"?</p>
<p>In other words, in this war, not only the entire nation and the soldiers on the front lines, but also everyone else can be said to be engaged in the war with the same qualifications. Therefore, what we people in the rear have to deeply reflect on is, when the soldiers on the front lines—such as the soldiers defending Attu Island—are working so hard, why are we, the same Yamato race in the rear, not more serious? In the past, when Japanese people talked about the nation, everyone dedicated their lives to the country. This is the proper attitude of the Japanese people. If we properly discuss the essence of this war, the entire nation should seriously carry out this war with the true attitude of the Japanese people. If everyone can forget themselves and devote themselves to the country's crisis, then it can be said that we have established the so-called invincible system in terms of content.</p>
<p>We often talk about the war of righteousness, and we say that we win because it is a war of righteousness. I think that is indeed the case. Originally, because it is a war of righteousness, the entire nation engaged in this war is also fulfilling righteousness. When practicing righteousness, there is no friction, no jealousy, no sinister darkness, and everyone is friendly and harmonious. The army and navy are of course harmonious, and the entire nation is also harmonious. This harmonious effort ultimately leads to the war being won.</p>
<p>This war of righteousness, in other words, is the so-called "holy war." It is a holy war, so we win. This is what the Japanese people can say. When thinking of the holy war, there is really no need to consider sacrificing one's life. Forget everything and sacrifice oneself for the country; that way, the war will be won. If we forget this premise, forget this stage, and only verbally shout "It is a war of righteousness, so we win," but in reality, there is no righteous conduct, then that's terrible!</p>
<p>The country has recently been strengthened. The people are practicing righteousness. The people have responded to Prime Minister Tojo's call on September 14th and have risen up. This is because the people clearly know this premise. I hope that under this premise, we can forget ourselves even more, and the entire nation can become one, and move forward. That is what I am thinking.</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura:</p>
<p>Recently, students have also enthusiastically joined the army. I think this fact is also an expression of the people's thorough understanding of the entity of the war.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara:</p>
<p>The students' enthusiastic uprising, I think, is precisely because they have clearly distinguished the essence of the war. The students have become one with the war! Now, those who are one with the war, first and foremost, are of course the soldiers on the front lines, and second, I think it is these students.</p>
<p>However, these students did not specifically obtain detailed war reports from the Imperial Headquarters, and the Asahi Shimbun's dispatches and features were not exclusively for the students. On the contrary, the students, because they are busy with their studies, do not observe the war situation in detail. But they know, "Today is the time for us to rise up." This is the expression of the true posture of the Japanese people who must all rise up. (Translation from Asahi Shimbun, December 5th)</p>

<h3>Advance Accounting and Payment for Purchased Gauze; Uninspected Gauze to be Kept by Original Applicant</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: The Business Coordination Council was ordered to handle the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in this city. The special fixed deposit slips to be paid have been approved by the Executive Yuan to start on October 1st. However, upon investigation, the types and names of the yarn and cloth applied for funding are numerous, and the quantities are also quite large, resulting in extremely complex and time-consuming procedures for sorting, investigating, and inspecting. In order to take care of business difficulties and enable them to receive the first installment of the fixed deposit slip payments on schedule and avoid long waits, special changes have been made. For the sold yarn and cloth that has not yet been inspected, the original applicant will first be responsible for safekeeping. The calculated price may be written by the applicant at the Cotton Industry Management Office, based on the standards set in the price appraisal table reported by the Business Coordination Council to the Executive Yuan for approval, after deducting the reserved quantity and exempt quantity, in order to verify the payment and notify collection. However, the applicant must guarantee the accuracy of the quantity, type, quality, and price of the goods sold, and must find two stores to guarantee them. If there are any shortages in the goods, if the varieties are substandard, or if the packaging is damaged in the future, it should be deducted from the price. That is, when the first special fixed deposit slip payment is received, the applicant must pay the difference to the Business Coordination Council in cash to complete the procedures and meet the actual situation. If the applicant conceals anything during the application, the guarantor shall bear joint and several legal liability. It is understood that the Council has specially stipulated the application filing date. It is hoped that all applicants for sale will verify the official receipt number and, in accordance with the regulations, take it to the Cotton Industry Management Office to obtain a price appraisal table and keep it in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p>Harmony and Joy</p>
<p>The Press Association believes that Sino-Japanese friendship values cultural exchange, and that the press circles are the vanguard of the cultural world.

After everyone was seated, Chen Binhe, president of Shen Bao, the monthly executive director of the association, delivered a speech, saying that today is the second time that the association has hosted a banquet for allied colleagues. We are honored by the presence of everyone and the special presence of officials from both China and Japan, which shows the extraordinary friendship and cultural exchange between China and Japan. Therefore, no ceremony will be held at today's celebration, and we pray that it will be practical. I had the opportunity to visit your country to attend the Greater East Asia Press Conference held in Tokyo, and I witnessed the efforts of your country's press circles and the struggles of the soldiers on the front lines, which complement each other. I express my great respect for this point. At the same time, I visited the elder Mr. Chofu So, a pioneer in your country's press circles, in a personal capacity, and had a long talk, which was even more gratifying. Therefore, after returning to China from Tokyo, I felt that colleagues from both China and Japan should cooperate more closely. Not only in public affairs, but also in private contact, should be close. Last week, your country's famous economists held a reception, and I also expressed my opinion on this, hoping to strengthen contact even more in the future and strive to increase emotions. We should start with our colleagues, and I hope to strengthen contact in both public and private aspects, and I hope that in the future, the Sino-Japanese joint celebration will be jointly hosted by both parties, so that the meaning of the celebration will be more genuine. Then, Mr. Chen introduced the Chinese guests, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, and the famous artist Liu Haisu, and Mr. Zhang chanted an ancient poem, and then asked Lieutenant Commander Nakagawa to chant a famous Japanese poem. Finally, Miss Pan Liudai of Ping Bao sang "China's Clothing," and there were impromptu performances to add to the fun. The atmosphere was harmonious and joyful, with mutual congratulations and toasting, until the meeting ended happily at 10:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Hua Tai Ferry Incident: Li Kaichen's Remarks; Overloading is the Main Cause</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: At about 7:00 PM on the 9th of this month, the Hua Tai ferry of the China Shipping Company sank in Xingang, drowning more than a thousand passengers. Li Kaichen, Director of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, made the following remarks: (1) Regarding the Hua Tai ferry incident, I deeply regret it after reading the newspaper reports. After inspecting and registering the ship, the total tonnage was 639.43 tons, the net tonnage was 359.07 tons, and the passenger capacity was limited to 538 people. However, the ship carried more than a thousand passengers this time, exceeding the capacity by more than double. Overloading is the main cause. (2) The Bureau has long ordered the handling of crew certification through the Ministry of Transportation. The crew hired by the company has mostly not been certified by the Bureau. The Bureau has repeatedly ordered them to come to the Bureau to handle the assessment, but the company has not complied, so the driving management may have gone awry. (3) After this case occurred, in addition to reporting to the Ministry of Construction, the Bureau has also sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to verify the handling. I hope that the families of the victims will come to the Bureau to clarify the details.</p>

<h3>First District Office Prints Enemy Aircraft Diagrams and Builds Model Air-raid Shelters</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: According to today's Thames News, the First District Office told the newspaper's reporter that, in order to enable its subordinate civil servants to obtain practical air-raid knowledge, it will soon publish diagrams of enemy aircraft. The diagrams will show the front, rear, and side views of the American aircraft that may attack in the future, so that all staff members can memorize them and be able to identify them at a glance. It is also said that the Public Works Department of the office will build model air-raid shelters in various public places before the end of this year. The shelters will be square or circular in shape and can accommodate one to six people. As for the enemy aircraft printed in the diagrams, the four-engine aircraft will be a hybrid B24 and Boeing B17, the medium bomber will be a North American B26 or Martin B26, and the fighter will be a Curtis P40. In short, all aircraft are American Air Force aircraft, and are now uniformly used by the Chongqing side. The diagrams will also explain the new markings used by the U.S. Air Force. The form and color are a blue circle with a white star in the middle, with red-edged squares on both sides. Regarding air-raid shelters, various styles and sizes have been planned, and it is sought to be easy to build. The details are not yet known, but model shelters may be built in open spaces such as Zhaoyan Garden. The Public Works Department of the office will also urge the various Baojia districts to build shelters in appropriate places, so that even if houses collapse, they will not be affected. This method will make shelters spread throughout the city in a short period of time. The style of the air-raid shelters will be to build a staircase to reach the trench.

<p>Economic Circles Commentary</p>
<h3>Implementing Thrift and Economy</h3>
<p>Proactive wartime economic policies aim to increase production, while passive wartime economic policies aim to reduce consumption. The two must be implemented in succession to achieve the intended results of wartime economic policies. In recent days, the Central and North China regions have been actively implementing campaigns to reduce consumption. Notable examples include the implementation of restrictions on electricity consumption in Shanghai, the regulations on banquet restrictions in Beijing, and the reduction of newspaper businesses in Tianjin, leaving only five major and minor newspapers, all of which are restrictions adapted to the situation to save material resources.</p>
<p>According to the "Outline of Wartime Economic Policy," regarding reducing consumption, civilian materials related to military needs should encourage the manufacture of substitutes or the acquisition of substitute raw materials. The production of various expensive and luxury goods should be restricted or prohibited. All unnecessary consumption should be suppressed. A quota rationing system should be gradually and separately implemented. May we ask whether the above points have been earnestly promoted? The manufacture of substitutes is rarely heard of, the production of luxury goods remains the same, unnecessary consumption is countless, and the quota rationing system is not yet thorough. If we want to achieve the desired effect of reducing consumption, then in terms of implementation, we must fully promote, and even forcibly implement, the "Outline of Wartime Economic Policy." It seems insufficient to implement thrift and economy merely by using a "treating the head when it hurts, treating the foot when it hurts" approach.</p>
<h3>Trade Associations Order Members to Report Stored Goods and Submit Reports on Schedule for Filing</h3>
<p>The various trade associations in this city, in order to prevent members from concealing goods or privately engaging in black market trading, are closely monitoring the shops and firms of their members. They send personnel to inspect their retail business operations at any time and inspect their purchase and sales ledgers. Recently, in order to understand the quantity of goods stored by each member at any time, the various trade associations have issued a type of goods storage report, ordering members to truthfully submit it to the association at the end of each month or every ten days for investigation. The report lists the name of the member's store, the address, the name of the warehouse where the goods are stored, the date and quantity of goods received, and the date and quantity of goods shipped. The report must also be stamped with the store's official seal. If the association finds that the information filled in on the report does not match the actual situation, it may be punished for the crime of hoarding.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>

<h3>Chinese Stocks Fall Sharply and Rebound Slightly, Lunhua and Dingxin Alone See Price Increase</h3>
<p>After a sharp drop in Chinese stocks yesterday, there was a sudden slight rebound. People's hearts have changed from tired to stable. The morning trend was soft, and buyers were reluctant to sell, resulting in a huge plunge. In the afternoon, many buyers appeared, and the rebound was also strong. However, due to the previous sharp drop, the closing price was still significantly lower than the previous day's. There were also outstanding performers, such as Lunhua and Dingxin in the "textile industry," and silk prices rose. Yong'an and Meiya were the most tired. Zhongfang, Xinhe, Hongxing, and other weaving companies all saw declines. In the "department store industry," Yong'an Company had low supply and high demand. At noon closing, it broke through 200 yuan. Xinxin fluctuated around the 140 yuan mark, both seeing small increases of four or five yuan. Guanghua Company's department store also saw a return to lower prices. In the "pharmaceutical industry," Xinya, Zhongfa, and others all saw small price increases. In the "financial industry," demand for withdrawals was high, and Shanghai and Zhejiang Xing both increased by 5,000 yuan. The salt industry was uniquely tired.

<h3>Impoverished Compatriots Need Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>At present, prices are soaring, and the lives of ordinary people are increasingly oppressed by life. At this time when the north wind is strong and the weather is getting colder every day, many impoverished compatriots are struggling to maintain their livelihoods, let alone making winter clothes. Some have even pawned all of their winter clothes. How will they survive the winter!</p>
<p>This time, the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao newspapers are raising funds for winter clothing to help impoverished compatriots. This action is very commendable. It is believed that society is not lacking in public-spirited people, and there are many wealthy people. It is hoped that they will understand the meaning of mutual assistance and sympathy and embrace the idea of helping others as if they were helping themselves. If they donate generously, the impoverished compatriots will greatly benefit!</p>
<p>The municipal authorities have always aimed to promote the welfare of the people and should also find ways to increase revenue to help them. It is my opinion that the ticket prices for entertainment venues in Shanghai have risen to over 100 yuan, and each venue is packed. If a certain amount is added to each ticket price, and small amounts are accumulated, this money can be used to make winter clothes. The impoverished compatriots will benefit greatly. With a simple wave of the hand, why wouldn't the authorities be happy to do so! (Zheng Yunying)</p>
<h3>Winter Clothing Donation Report</h3>
<p>Huazhong Tobacco donated 500 yuan to the labor union, the fifth-grade class committee of the newspaper workers' elementary school donated 400 yuan, the sixth-grade class committee of the newspaper workers' elementary school donated 300 yuan, Suzhu Shuren Elementary School donated 224 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen, anonymous donor from the business department of Wuzhou Pharmacy donated 200 yuan, Mrs. Yin donated 50 yuan, totaling 1,674 yuan, 8 jiao, and 5 fen. Together with the previous balance, the total is 129,411 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Eight</p>
<p>The main pillar has collapsed. For the Gu family, this is a serious problem, and the whole family now feels it deeply. The deceased Zhenji, in fact, single-handedly supported the family and everything inside and outside the shop. However, the emptiness felt by the bereaved family is not just the loss of a person responsible for buying and selling rice and groceries—it is not of that nature.</p>
<p>(Daddy is gone)</p>
<p>The emptiness felt by Sueo, who is only five years old this year, is also the state of mind of everyone in the family.</p>
<p>In particular, the impact on Wakako is even greater. In any occasion, she is not a woman who oversteps in front of her husband. Although her hands are already like worn-out baseball gloves, she still works tirelessly, ultimately being a good helper to her husband. She silently and attentively understood her husband's feelings, raised her children, and worked hard in the store. Therefore, is this woman like a boat that has lost its rudder?</p>
<p>What will happen to the store? What will happen to Chunko, who is 26 years old, and Mitsuko, who is 23 years old? How will Jindo and Sueo grow up?</p>
<p>(No matter what, we have to find a way?)</p>
<p>Whether she can do it or not, the woman can only shoulder all the realities of the burden.</p>
<p>If she were the wife of a samurai family, then in the Satsuma region, Wakako would have to gather her children in front of her father's ancestral tablet and resolutely order something. But she did not do that. On the day after the funeral, she tied up the thick apron left by her husband and silently began to work several times harder than before. When Zennichiro, who was teaching as a substitute, said he wanted to stay in the store to help, Wakako shook her head.</p>
<p>Due to her mother's instinct, she knows the paths of her sons. They are not suited to work in the store. They should go their own paths. For the same reason, she accepted Shirokichi's request. Shirokichi, the most gentle of the brothers, dropped out of Kojima Commercial School after two years and took care of the shop. Just like Jindo, he did not complain at all. He took off his uniform and stood beside the rice milling machine.</p>
<p>The women are even more responsible, from the eldest daughter Chunko, who has missed her marriage, to Hokko, who is 16 years old, each has her own duties. In this way, the new system of the Gu family has begun.</p>
<p>Soon, the children forgot the emptiness of not having a father. Because the Gu family did not know when they had erected a new main pillar. Wakako is that pillar. Although she is not a heroine or an efficient mother, the children's instinctual trust is firmly tied to her.</p>
