<p>社評</p>
<h3>改善公務員生活</h3>
<p>公務員是國家政策的實際執行者，所以，他們的生活和國策與民命，有着密切的關聯。我們要求行政效力提高，首先便須改善和保障全國各級公務員的生活。</p>
<p>公務員的生活，大約可分為三種：第一等人物是旣廉潔而又幹練的，他們只知為國盡忠，為民服務，但結果都是兩袖淸風，上不足以贍親長，下不足以養妻孥，抱「君子固窮」之義，而不减其樂。第二等人物是一方面盡責辦公，一方面撈錢，這種人在最近數十年來中國政治上佔着很高的地位。不過，只有極少數的倖運兒，始終維持於不敗之地位，多數人由於撈錢，初僅補其不足，繼而取之近貪，終於身敗名裂。第三等人物，是做官只知撈錢，不知辦事，甚至幹的是禍國殃民的勾當。國家許多良法美政，都斷送在這單人手裏。</p>
<p>我們今日，倡言改善與保障公務員的生活：第一是要在消極方面澈底肅淸那單只拿錢不辦事的公務員，吸收各方面真正的人才去　補他們。在積極方面，只有改善他們的待遇，使能維持最低限度的本身及家屬生活，然後責成盡責辦事。第二是盡力設法改善一面辦事一面撈錢的公務員，增加他們的薪津，使盡其全部心力，為國家人民辦事。第三是要獎勵上述第一等優良的公務員，不問其職位高至特任官，低至辦事員，只要廉潔奉公，便應特加獎勵，公開宣揚，作為模範公務員，同時在物質上保障其足夠的生活。這是我們主張改善和保障公務員生活的原則。</p>
<p>就目前全國公務員的實際生活情形而言，由於物價的高漲，幾乎全體都感覺入不敷出。雖然若干機關另有特別津貼，然而實際上都追不上物價增漲的速率。換句話說，全體公務員的俸餉，都不足以維持其最低限度生活的，上焉者只足以糊口，欲言贍家，已感困難；中而下之，即本身之生活亦不能維持，更談不到贍養家屬，敎育子女。物質之生活已苦，精神之慰安全無，雖　如顏回，恐亦不能「不改其樂」。於是大都抱「五日　兆」之心，不復專心於政務。</p>
<p>我們希望政府立即設法改善公務員待遇，應該重定各級俸餉與津貼數額，以各地物價指數為標準，至少限度使各級公務員都能贍養家屬，敎育子女。同時，在精神上提高其自尊心，使感覺國家付託之重，人人奮勉，專心奉公。</p>
<p>最後，我們請求政府必須絕對禁止高級公務員經商，並嚴禁高官大吏的奢侈生活。使政風為之一新，然後政治效率必能由此增高，然後始能適應戰時需要，而實現國家的戰時政策，完遂參戰的重大使命。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>宋美齡渡美</h3>
<p>在加蕯勃朗加會談中，英美决定傾主力於歐洲的戰局，在太平洋方面則暫取守勢。澳洲，重慶對此都表示非常不滿，羅斯福於上月十二日林肯紀念日解釋加蕯勃朗加的决定稱，將來的具體計劃並不限於某一戰塲，某一大陸，或某水域，在會談中所决定的別的事項也很多，今後一年以內，全世界將不在言語上，而在行動上可以得到答覆。宋美齡此次短短的華盛頓十日之遊，即在於想探索會談的底蘊。</p>
<p>美國由於南太平洋戰爭的經騐，明白了如欲對日本本土加以攻擊，不能不以中國為對日進攻的基點。中國的重要性，因戰略的變化而愈增大，問題在於幾時開始對日攻擊。</p>
<p>重慶方面的不安，焦燥，與憤懣，都因為美國的援助是口惠而實不至。宋子文呼　於先，宋美齡的渡美於後，宋美齡前次渡美時，帶回的禮物為五億美元的借款。在重慶，宋美齡被尊為「國母」。在美國，與羅斯福夫人同被稱頌為「象徴民主自由的世界偉大女性」。乃宋美齡的忽　渡美，實以有此自負。</p>
<p>羅斯福在對日進攻上與重慶的意見完全一致，祇是時間問題而已。這時間唯有求之於神，祈求從速降臨。一切都托庇於神而藉詞諉避，我們借宋美齡的渡美活動這件事上，可以獲悉羅斯福偽裝下的真面目。</p>
<p>我們聽到美國記者團的責問，說「中國在人的資源方面尚未加以完全利用」的話，至為不慊。美國所希望中國人為美國而流血的方法，重慶應用肉彈，不用美國的武器，去與日本的軍隊作戰，這質問簡直把中國人當作美國的奴隸，這對於中國人是怎樣的侮辱，然而宋美齡漠然無知。她回答說：「許多中國人都赤手空拳面戰」。這正是一杯悽酸的苦酒。</p>
<p>美蔣關係的本質，在此問答中暴露無遺。重慶是美國的砲灰，重慶政權出賣了中國人的鮮血。宋美齡回到重慶之後，或將感到失望與憤懣，而從美國帶回的禮物，大概將是大東亞民族的覺醒吧。（翔：譯自二月廿二日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<p>東戰塲冰雪溶解　德軍在南路反攻　卡科夫迤西蘇軍被阻　（蘇坦克車軍長巴夫羅夫陣亡）</p>
<p>德元首行營二日海通社電　德軍戰報稱、昨日東歐南路德軍數度反攻、　班區之德軍、痛擊蘇軍、摧毀敵兵準備進攻之企圖、伊齊姆區內氣候地勢雖皆不利行軍、德軍仍擊潰蘇軍、奪佔多地、俘敵之數及戰勝品之數量與日俱增、蘇聯坦克車第廿五軍長巴夫羅夫中將陣亡、卡科夫迤西、奧萊爾迤北及伊爾門湖迤南各處進攻之蘇軍、未遂所圖、損失慘重而退、伊爾門湖東南德米安斯克橋頭堡壘、為十四個月以來蘇軍屢圍奪取而未果之陣地、德軍最近始按照預定計劃放棄之、德軍撤退之前、曾將所有軍火悉數運出、撤退時未遭遇敵軍之阻礙、</p>
<p>瑞典京城一日同盟社電　據此間本日所得訊、冬季大規模之蘇軍反攻、現已轉弱、因戰地冰雪溶解較常為早、德軍在三處主要戰地均佔優勢、第一處為烏克蘭北部及卡科夫與庫斯克附近、該地哥里可夫將軍之軍隊曾被德軍重創、第二處為唐納資盆地、德方已將坦克車隊及機械部隊、源源開往、第三處為羅斯托夫之西、德軍已在坦克隆及密斯河發動强烈反攻、</p>
<p>柏林二日海通社電　最近東綫之主要戰爭有三、（一）德軍進攻伊齊姆、正在順利進展中、（二）蘇軍在卡科夫西北之進展已受遏阻、（三）蘇軍以壓力加諸奧萊爾吾軍防綫之南翼、並無成效、此外德軍在唐納資中部之先鋒部隊今已進抵克拉馬托斯卡亞西北及羅索　之北面、巴本哥伏現正在激烈巷戰中、蘇軍被圍殲滅在即、蘇軍沿唐納資仍在猛烈抵抗中、兵員雖多、但坦克車極少、按二月二十一日至二月二十八日期內、蘇軍所損失之坦克車有一千零六十輛之多、由此可知蘇軍坦克車已感缺乏、蘇軍之進攻密烏斯、似為救伊齊姆方面之急、但並未獲逞、蘇軍在哥諾　浦方面之進展、亦已受到遏阻、</p>
<p>柏林二日海通社電　柏林軍界人士昨夜談稱、東綫各段氣候轉佳、德軍所守陣地日臻鞏固、</p>
<p>斯丹埠二日海通社電　據此間半官方面今晨得莫斯科息、因德軍最近之勝利、蘇軍對德軍反攻之防務與蘇軍之給養交通綫、必須重加部署、莫斯科承認唐納資區之蘇軍昨未能遏阻德軍坦克車隊之前鋒、德軍並已突破二月初旬蘇軍所佔之陣地、克拉馬托斯卡亞之德軍、亦獲局部之勝利、蘇軍現正從事於攻勢第二階段之準備、</p>
<p>唐納資河流域仍有坦克大戰</p>
<p>蘇聯邊境某地二日哈瓦斯社電　德蘇兩軍昨在唐納資河流域、　續從事激戰、德軍在克拉馬多斯加亞城附近、向前推進、蘇聯官方對於紅軍該戰區所扼守之陣地、並未坦白說明、惟據德方消息、證實德軍業已佔領克拉馬托斯卡亞及羅索伏亞兩城、並悉紅軍一大隊、陷於孤立無援之困境、刻在巴爾文戈伏城四週、佈置陣地、作最後掙扎、按之英國駐莫斯科訪員來電稱、「當納粹德國决意調動大批軍隊至此一狹長戰綫作戰時、紅軍自不能阻制其前進、是以德軍已獲得立足之點、當在情理之常、德方生力軍仍開往克拉馬托斯卡亞區增援、雙方在某某數處地方、發生爭奪戰、　數易其手、目下猶在苦戰之中」、此在紅軍總司令部亦發表戰報稱、雙方曾在唐納資河流域、發生大規模之坦克車戰、此際仍在盛戰中、據德方消息、蘇聯名將波波夫將軍所部鐵甲車隊、遭受重大損失、足以構成紅軍荏弱之來源、莫斯科半官方面談稱、紅軍攻勢、已趨緩和、推原其故、殆有三大因素、（一）德軍堅决抵抗、（二）地面冰雪、開始溶解、（三）需要鞏固最近收獲之陣地、故目下唐納資河流域及卡科夫區之戰事、其性質業已改變、過去雙方均集中大批步兵作戰、並用坦克車衝鋒、但至此際、則已改由遊擊隊活動矣、蘇聯工兵在後方修理交通綫、查此項工作、非常困難、在德軍撤退之前、均將其付之一炬、摧毀殆盡、加以最近積雪溶解、戰壕內充滿雨水、此乃東綫一般情况也、</p>
<p>丁莫生柯指揮西北戰區軍事</p>
<p>至於各區戰况、茲將其分述如次、（一）高加索邦無重要事件足述、（二）塔干洛格區、紅軍在米褐斯河附近廣及八英里之戰綫大舉進攻、紅軍參加此役者、不下數師之眾、（三）唐納資河流、蘇聯方面承認德軍採取某種戰略、使在克拉馬多斯加亞區之紅軍有被包圍之虞、紅軍沿卡科夫—谷諾托普一綫前進者、似已完全膠着、不能有所進展、（四）庫斯克區無重大變化、惟高里戈夫將軍所部、自庫斯克城出發、沿鐵路前進、業已通過奧萊爾　、（五）伊爾門湖區、蘇方宣稱、紅軍獲得重大成就、收復特米亞斯克城及其他兩城、據莫斯科廣播電臺發出消息稱、此項敗兵、係屬於德國陸軍第十六軍、由勃許將軍統帥、至戰勝之紅軍、則為丁莫生柯將軍之部下、紅軍戰報未提及丁莫生柯將軍、為時已久、此次戰報、又見其大名矣、此次紅軍獲勝、關係重大、緣德軍在塞里格爾湖區之凸出部份、向為莫斯科·列寗城鐵路之威脅、紅軍此次獲勝、使此項威脅消滅於無形矣、惟此後僅有局部性質、不似發展為大規模之攻勢、此在拉多加湖之南、紅軍進攻德軍陣地、先後不下十七次之多、均為德軍所擊退、且受重大損失、（六）芬蘭前綫、平靜無事、</p>
<p>芬京二日海通社電　莫斯科電臺昨報吿伊爾門湖區戰况時發表稱、西北戰區現在丁莫生柯元帥指揮之下、渠何時就任此職、則未予透露、</p>
<p>里斯本二日中央社電　據莫斯科來電、蘇聯情報局一日夜特別發表稱、丁莫生柯元帥所部蘇軍已於莫斯科至列寗格勒中間地區展開新作戰、</p>

<p>里斯本二日中央社電　據北非前綫消息、軸心軍二十八日於突尼西亞東北方沿比塞大西方約三十五公里之塞拉多岬起、經梅傑茲厄爾巴布、至步阿拉達、於連亙五十公里之廣大戰綫上、發動全面攻勢、其中尤以突尼斯西方四十公里之班吉亞方面戰爭最熾烈、德軍出動新銳戰車步兵集中攻擊反軸心軍陣地、現已迫近該地東方十五公里地點、反軸心前綫消息亦均紛傳班吉亞之危機、稱反軸心軍若不克阻止軸心軍前進時、軸心軍如進展至梅傑茲厄爾巴布、則反軸心軍退路即被切斷、又羅美爾軍於突尼西亞中部地區一度前進後、已轉鋒他處、更以巧妙戰術誘導反軸心軍、自卡塞爾利奴至該地南方二十八公里之非利亞那方面地雷陣地中、且更續向斯貝多拉北方進擊、已將敵軍東進企圖完全粉碎、</p>

<h3>法國交還在華租界</h3>
<p>— 日本輿論一斑</p>
<p>其一</p>
<p>希法國政府公佈，交還在華的租界，同時並撤廢治外法權。日本在一月九日業已與國府簽訂具有同樣內容的中日協定，而盟國義大利亦於同月十四日繼之倣行。但此次法國政府決定放棄的中間，如上海的法租界，乃費了將近百年的歲月而造成的，含有準殖民地的意義，法國曾付出了相當的犧牲，一月十一日，英美為取媚重慶而撤廢治外法權，交還在華租界，當然與此不可同日而語。蓋法國在中華民國境內，事實上有所謂租界地城的存在，並保有所謂治外法權之對人的權利，反之，英美在事實上則幾已消滅，雖說放棄，在實際上則無關痛癢。</p>
<p>上海法租界的成立，根據正式條約，有法律的根據，經多年來辛勤經營，總領事之下有行政，司法，警察，衛生，消防，教育等完整的組織，更有法國正規軍的駐屯，所以與純粹的法國殖民地無多大差別。這一重要地域以及百年來治外法權的放棄，不能不說是法國對於以國民政府為中樞的新生中國之好意的表示，又駐北京的戈思默法國大使，前幾天在上海與國民政府外交部長褚民誼氏的會談等事實，亦値得注意。</p>
<p>此種賢明的舉措，實出於法國賴伐爾首長的明察，對日採取協調的態度所致。租界收回，法權恢復以後，在行政與司法上，希望能勝過以前在外國官憲治理下的成績，將掃除百年來國際間陳舊事態之意義，明白顯示於中外，又此次維希政府的舉措，可說是對於日本歷年來努力安定東亞的報答，中日法三國互相提携，確立東亞永遠的和平。（翔：譯自二月廿四日朝日新聞社論）</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>法國政府在二十三日通知中國國民政府，決定交還北京使館區和上海，天津，漢口，廣東，鼓浪嶼等各租界及公共租界。當國民政府參戰時，日本政府根據中日共同宣言的本旨，交還租界並撤廢治外法權，鄭重表示尊重中國主權。盟邦義國政府繼續響應。中國民衆認為不平等的租界和治外法權，僅有法國一國未有取消。但賢明的法國當局，接着也毅然交還租界和撤廢治外法權，使中國得脫百年來的束縛，恢復了完整和獨立國家的令譽。</p>
<p>法國自從賴伐爾內閣成立後，拋棄過去的　望主義，和德國同心協力以求國家的更生。賴伐爾首長抱定這種根本方針，打破國內的一切困難，督促國民趨向這一條光明大道。去年秋間，英美兩國非法侵入法屬北非，公然對法啟　，而法國的協助軸心國政策，也在這時候到達了決定的階段。法國協助軸心國的政策，不但是在歐洲和德義協力爭取勝利。而且把協助軸心的政策普及到東亞，上次發表日越共同宣言後，就增進了一層親善關係，接着又成立經濟協定，這次日本軍進駐廣州灣之際，法國政府和越南當局的善意諒解和協力，事實上證明了雙方關係的密切，法國政府不但協助我日本，更願意協助與日本處於同一戰綫共向擊滅英美征途前進的國民政府，毅然宣佈交還租界，撤廢治外法權，希望增進中法友好關係。法國政府雖未正式承認國府，但是這一次的措置，卻有極重大的意義。對於法國的盛意，國府當然感激，即處於盟邦立塲的日本，也表示萬分謝意。</p>
<p>中國主權完全恢復之後，國府的基礎愈益鞏固，政治必然跟着加强。汪主席也可以趁此完成百年來宿願，獨立自主和政治力得到把握後，必能澈底推進各項戰時施策，使每一個中國人都知道「戰爭的國民」的使命。收回租界，廢除不平等條約，不是重慶方面抗戰建國的唯一口號嗎？然而重慶方面只換得毫無實際的英美空頭支票，依然甘願墮落去做叛逆行為，而國民政府得日義法三國的擁護，一舉解决百年的束縛，完全恢復了國家的自主權。從此消滅了重慶的抗戰理由，中國的民心，必然是傾向國府無疑了。（仟雲　：譯自二月廿五日東京讀賣報知社論）</p>

<h3>尊重國府主權　日本重申方針</h3>
<p>二月二十四日午後的衆議院華北開發會社委員會席上，手代木委員長就政府對華政策提出質問稱：</p>
<p>（一）日本政府所取對華的基本政策，在强化國府的政治力，日華互相協力，向完遂大東亞戰爭而邁進。在實現上，政府對中國將取何種態度，希望對此點加以說明。</p>
<p>（二）其次，交付租界，撤廢治外法權等措置，對於華北開發，華中振興等諸國策會社，以至於一般在華日人的經濟活動上，自然有相當的影響。政府對此所取的方針如何？請加以說明，使關係業者知所適從。</p>
<p>關於日本對華政策的基本，由靑木大東亞相答覆，關於大東亞戰爭之有關中國者，則由陸軍省軍務局長佐藤說明，茲記其要旨如次：</p>
<p>靑木大東亞相　日本對華的根本方針，為尊重中國的自由獨立，與發揮國府的政治力，此在本委員會及其他會席上業已屢加說明。國府因此次參戰，而與日本同生共死，相互提携，決意挺身於擊滅英美戰爭，日本與中國在政治上，軍事上，經濟上保持密切的合作，向完遂大東亞戰爭而邁進。此後兩國的關係，當然更為密切。因為這是二個獨立國間的提携，所以嚴守尊重對方的立塲，國府方面為表示對日方的協力，在各種政務上，完全出於自動的發揮，日本對其施政，並不出以干涉態度。</p>
<p>例如國旗問題，完全出於國府主權之自動的發揮，與日本毫無關係。同時，日本之所以採取交還租界，撤廢治外法權等措置者，即為尊重中國的主權，亦完全出於日本之自動的考慮。</p>
<p>其次，就日本所取措置，對於在華日人的影響而言，日本對華的態度，希望實現眞正的日華提携，所以日人的經濟發展，應拋棄英美人所持的權益與特權的觀念。今後華北開發，華中振興兩會社的關係事業，也將使其與中國產業的振興合作，並須加以適當的調整。至於就一般日人的活動說來，難免有若干影響，但對於以眞正的日華提携的精神為基礎的活動，不致於有何影響。</p>
<p>如此，眞正的日華提携，共存共榮的基礎乃得確立。唯有立於此新基礎之上，日人之具有永久性的飛躍的發展乃能確保。在中國經營事業的日本人，切望其充分瞭解國策的意趣，出以欣然合作的態度。</p>
<p>佐藤軍務局長　方才大東亞大臣的解釋，本人與有同感。茲從戰爭指導的見地，對若干點加以補充。日本對華所取的政策，從戰爭上說來，是消滅重慶方面抗日戰爭的憑藉。孫文革命的指導精神，為廢棄不平等條約，使中國從殖民地的地位解放：換言之，近世中國國民運動的指導精神，即企求中國脫離殖民地的地位，確保完全的獨立。這一大事業，中國如用本身的力量，今後即使經過悠長的歲月，付出了非常的犧牲，是否能夠成功，頗成疑問，然而因為日本對華政策的轉變，這大事業輕易完成，此舉在中國及日本甚至於東亞的歷史上，將產生很大的變革。但此舉實現的理由，實為國民政府還都以來汪主席的努力與其成績，日本對之深為依賴與合作所致。</p>
<p>而且不僅重慶方面的抗戰失所憑藉，即美國也失却了大部分的戰爭目的。中國事變以來，美國對日本常加阻撓，日本在華的行動，美國武斷為主權領土的侵害，與經濟的獨佔。</p>
<p>現在日本取此政策之後，不能再說是主權與領土的侵害了，孫文革命以來，中國人民所熱烈要求的恢復中國的完全獨立，由於日本的協力而得以實現。對於此點，美國作何感想？又經濟合作道一名詞，美國常武斷為日本企圖獨占中國，現在不僅交還了租界與治外法權等，而且在戰爭中流血所得的敵產權益，日本亦已全部返還中國。武斷為獨占的經濟行為的美國人，睹此又有何說？固然，現在我們毋須美國對此的諒解，但日本這種政策的轉變，對於消滅重慶方面，美國方面的抗戰藉口，實有極重大的影響。</p>
<p>因政策的轉變，在中日人士的個人之間，或在會社的地位看來，或許受到多少損害，在此立塲上的人們，因為國策的於事無補，反而妨害自己的利益，或許加以反對，但從大局着想，政府方面，軍部方面，無論有何障碍，斷然加以排除，以求貫徹這一政策。（翔·譯自二月二十五日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>中日合作興修水利　治理黃河方案確定</h3>
<p>開封上游的黃河堤防，自民國二十七年被蔣介石正規軍為收拾開封失陷後的戰局，而加以潰決，致淮河流域以至於揚子江下游的廣大地域，全遭汜濫，又潰決點的下游黃河流域，即河南省北部及山東省，水的灌漑斷絕，其結果有廣大的中國　村歸於荒廢，以致年產棉花〇〇担，小麥〇〇萬噸的農產品，完全損失。日本為改善此情况，經數年來的研究調查，漸獲成案，與國府合作，着手實行。靑木大東亞相在二十三日午前衆議院華北開發會社委員會答覆原口純允氏的責問如次：</p>
<p>「黃河的治理，如歷史所示，為中國數千年來的重大懸案。蔣介石非但不加修繕，且反而使之更趨惡化，因此淮河流域一帶成為一片汪洋，而舊河流則成乾涸，其救濟為治安上，農村復興上之重大問題，自不待言。與亞院東來研究所曾加以詳細的調查研究，已獲具體的修繕治水政策的初步方案，今將與國府合作開始此歷史的偉大事業。（翔：譯自二月二十四日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>陜省物價槪况</h3>
<p>— 金彥</p>
<p>節節上漲去年尤甚　管制機構事權不一</p>
<p>陜西貨價問題，年來最為人所重視，社會上無論任何階層，友朋相見，談話一分鍾，大多都要牽到這個事件。從前是一般普通人（消費者）憂慮物價上漲，現在是少數人（囤積者）恐怕物價下跌，於是到處都能聽到研究和操心統制的呼聲，但其實物價竟跌了沒有，依然未跌。蓋囤積者恐怕跌，要賣出，一般人也恐怕跌，不敢買，物價在此情况之下，實際上不過暫時安定而已。</p>
<p>數年以來，陜西物價節節上漲，尤以今年突飛猛進，相差太遠，如土磨麵粉要五元六角一斤，機製混合粉官定價格為一百九十三元一袋，但事實上買不出貨，黑市則漲至二百六七十元！普通布疋每尺須二十餘元，杜米賣九十元一市斗，石灰七百元一噸，白菜一元四五角一斤，尤以小販把白菜切開來零售，為自古未有之現象，年老人詫為奇觀。至理發普通須十二元，所以一般人的衣食生活都發生了問題，於是惹起各方不滿。陜西物價上漲的原因，第一，貨物來源减少，供求失調；第二，許多東南各地貨物。以陜西為唯一入口要衝，不但甘靑寗等省向來由陜輸入，更有四川商人大幫來此辦貨，據調查資本多而來頭大者，卽不下一千餘家，其中除少數東往向洛陽界首搶購外，其餘大多數均在西安收買，出價爽利，量數不拘，此事對於陜西物價之刺激，至為重大。第三，西安市銀行之多，向所未有，除中，中，交，農等暨舊有之金城，上海，陜西省等商業銀行外，尚有川康，川鹽，裕華，亞西實業，興文，四明等等，月月有新設立者，或購地建屋，或租房刷新，均已次第開業。此外又有各省銀行分荘或辦事處，總計不下數十家。銀行旣多，自難免有若干家從事法定業務以外之活動。甚至尚有假設工廠公司名義，大量收購農產物，謂曰「原料」，事實上有的廠未開工，有的用少買多，不過待價而沽，或直捷了當，只見買進，不見賣出。刺激物價，則莫此為甚。今年關中產麥區收麥時　雨為災，質量均大减，入夏後又久旱不雨，秋收至薄，以故糧食缺乏。一方又以陜西近年人口驟增，由晋豫及東南各省來陜分居各縣者，不下數百萬人，目前沿隴海路綫各城市，街上行人，幾乎半係外省口音，凡此新客，不是作官，便為小工商販，做荘稼的可謂絕少，即或有之，而可耕之田，並未增加，以故生之者寡，食之者衆，糧食更覺缺乏。兼之河南省現在災情慘重，難民絡繹西來，本省又須接濟河南軍民食用，大批糧食東運，糧食　少而隨之刺激工價物價上漲。當局過去對管制物資，非未舉辦，無如事權不一，掣肘太多，設計不密，掛一漏萬，故終於未能收到實效。陜西省政府近制定各種平抑物價章則，成立檢查平賣機構，於抑平物價能收到若何效果，尚不可卜也。</p>

<h3>從交還租界說到　南市應改良的幾點</h3>
<p>— 三金</p>
<p>法國政府為加强中法兩國邦交起見，隨友邦日本與我國签訂交還租界與撤消治外法權之協定後，行見上海市政即將統一，非但上海市民同感無限之興奮，即全國人民，甚至與我友好之各國亦莫不同聲慶賀者。可是我們的責任、也就愈加重大，因為我們非但要保持租界的現狀，而且還要把他發揚光大；非但要把租界發揚光大，而且還須把市區行政力求進步，與租界並駕齊驅，以免發生畸形現狀而完成多年來之大上海計劃。方不負友邦等交還租界之美意。譬如南市，就有下列幾點，急須改良：</p>
<p>（一）按期公　　南市以前所行配給米麵辦法，未能與租界相同，望以後同樣按期公　，數量亦與租界相等。則居民必較便利。</p>
<p>（二）淸除垃圾　市警察總局為切實維護市區公共衛生，曾佈吿取締不衛生悪習，對於路側傾倒垃圾，隨地便溺，任意吐痰等，以其易傳播肺癆等流行病症，尤加嚴禁，違者將予處罰，可是要禁止路側傾倒垃圾等的第一步，還須將到處堆積如山的垃圾，澈底淸除，然後通令目警團等協助禁止路側傾倒垃圾，以重衛生，才能發生實效。</p>
<p>（三）恢復交通　法國政府雖與我國签訂交還租界與撤消治外法權協定，但因手續關係，恐非最短期間所能實行，但是將上海華法交界之鐵門全部開放，以恢復戰前的原狀，那是可以立即實行的，希望能尅日實現。</p>
<p>南市在戰前有　車，公共汽車，就是戰後也曾行駛過公共汽車，自從大東亞戰事發生後，公共汽車即行停駛，迄未恢復，為便利交通，整頓市容起見，希望早日恢復電車或公共汽車站交通。</p>
<p>（四）修理街路　開關新路，或是放闊街路，暫時也許不易進行，但是修理道路，尤其是淸除街路上的瓦　，那是輕而易舉的，希望市政當局加以注意。</p>
<p>總之，上海市政不久即可統一，在未統一前，必須使市區的一切，都能和租界比美，將來才能融洽無間，質之市政當局，以為何如？</p>

<p>南洋各地特輯之五</p>
<p>東印度滄桑記（三）　喬松</p>
<p>（乙）鑛產資源　東印度鑛產，爲次於農業的重要資源，埋藏物中主要的是石油·煤·金·銀·錳·碘化鉀·鐵·二銅·鎳·鐵礬土·硬石油·金剛鑽·硫黄·鉛·亞鉛·鉻·水銀·鉏·銻·蒼鉛·鎢等；現在已開採的是石油·煤·金·銀·錳·碘化鉀·錫·硬石油·鐵礬土·金剛鑽·硫黄等，而石油與錫的資源，尤馳名於世，鐵及鎳的鑛量也很豐富，至今還未大舉開發，因爲過去荷印的鑛業法，不許一般人自由採掘。荷印主要鑛物，出產量如下表：</p>
<p>主要鑛物出產量（單位公噸）：</p>
<p>數字依據大每「英美追致與大東亞經濟」。</p>
<p>石油爲東印度鑛產物的大宗，其埋藏量約爲三十億桶（巴禮），分佈極爲廣泛，現已採油的爲蘇門答臘，爪哇，婆羅洲，及西蘭各油由，其餘還待今後的調查與開發，但一九三九年的產油額爲七百九十四萬八千公鐓，佔世界第五位。（內六十九萬八千公鐓爲原油，作爲燃料出售，餘七百二十五萬公鐓爲精油，二百萬公鐓的汽油和四十一萬公鐓飛機用汽油），東印度這種石油，一向由英，荷，美資本下的三大公司，作獨佔性的經營。</p>
<p>錫爲軍事上必要的金屬，世界列强都沒有足够的生產，而爲南洋一帶獨佔的產品。而東印度的錫產，則次於馬來，玻璃維亞而居世界錫產量的第三位，年產約三萬公鐓。東印度產錫的要地是蘇鬥答臘，婆羅洲兩大島間的邦加海峽一帶的邦加島，勿里洞島，和蘇門答臘與馬來半島之間的辛克卜島三處爲主，此外，利俄羣島卡里門，和蘇門答臘島也有著名的錫鑛，其中邦加島的錫鑛，全部由政府直接經營，勿里洞島則由政府與民間共同出資的勿里洞鑛業公司經營。</p>
<p>鉛的原鑛鐵礬土的基地，以利俄羣島中的冰敦島爲中心，而巴太姆島，卡里門島和南方的邦加島也有相當良質發現。此外，婆羅洲和爪哇也有埋藏，不過都還沒有大量的開發。又冰敦島的鐵礬土鑛爲日本人所發見，其鑛量約四千萬噸</p>
<p>其他如鎳，在西里伯斯有豐富的埋藏量，該島馬太尼湖，德華齊湖附近一帶的鎳鑛，具有三·五％以上的品位。鐵鑛在爪哇，蘇門答臘，婆羅洲，西里伯斯，摩鹿加羣島，傳有約十億公鐓的埋藏量尙未開發。而目前，已有相當規模之開發的是金，銀，錳，金剛鑚，碘化鉀，硫黄，硬石油等，而一般的說，則豐富的鑛藏，還在未調查未開發的狀態。</p>
<p>（四）國際資本的侵入</p>
<p>荷蘭獲得東印度的統治權以來，爲着荷蘭本國的繁榮而指導荷印的企業，利用原住民的勞力，獎勵栽培世界需要的農產物橡樹，茶，咖啡，砂糖，棕櫚油樹等。這種强力獎勵栽植特定農產的結果，引起了東印度經濟的機構之變化。其一爲國際貿易的發展、其二爲重要商品的國際協定。</p>
<p>例如在與英美貿易最盛的橡膠方面，雨後春笋一般的結成了國際卡爾特，如茶的國際卡爾特，砂糖的國際卡爾特等國際同業同盟組織，使荷印成爲這種卡爾特的盟員，不過，在這些國際卡爾特中，英美，尤其是英國，佔有領導的地位，而在荷印的外國投資額中，英美又佔有較多的數額，因此，荷印之爲英美一利藪、荷印一切之間接爲英美所操縱，便不難想見了。</p>
<p>各國對荷印投資額（單位千盾）：</p>
<p>數字（依據同上表）</p>
<p>再從各種別投資的情形來看：</p>

<p>友朋節　溫故知新　楊郁生</p>
<p>友情是最偉大的。古人最重友情，今人大漠視，還應從友朋做起，認父母兄弟是血統之友，不致有閱墻之慘禍，認夫婦是家庭之友，不致有離婚之悲劇，認社曾各階層皆可爲友，自無怨恨仇嫉之暴動，我中國向爲禮義之邦，特摘錄中西古賢訓語，欲建設新秩序，必須溫故而知新焉！</p>
<p>（一）孔子云：益者三友，損者三友，（二）詩經：相彼鳥矣，猶求友聲…神之聽之，終和且平，（三）論語：與朋友交，言而有信，（四）曾子：君子以文會友，以友輔仁，（五）呂溪云：要成好人，須尋好友，引酵若酸，那得甜酒？（六）戰國策：以財交者，財盡則交絕，以色交者，華落而受渝，（七）盧梭云：爲己而棄友之人，是無作朋友之價値，愼之，（八）古詩：『勢利之朋不可親，結交須近老成人，善良自有芝蘭氣，緩急相依見性眞，』（九）曾國藩說：擇友第一要事”須擇志趣遠大者，（十）西諺：無朋友之人，只可算人之一半，（十一）拜倫云：良友不忘盡其義務，（十二）漢書：一生一死乃知交情，一貧一富乃知交態，（十三）莊子云：天下與我並生，萬物與我爲一，（友情推廣於天下），（十四）華嚴經云：願令衆生，當得安樂，無諸病苦，（友情推廣於衆生），（十五）龍猛菩薩發菩提心論：我當利益安樂無餘有情界，觀十方含識猶如己身，（是最偉大的友情，是菩薩心腸），</p>
<p>友朋節歌　江謙</p>
<p>世間大族無如友，友字得形從兩手，有事相助痛相摩，一脈相通分左右。一鄉一國有限人，友則放懷通宇宙；上友千秋古聖賢，一編相對心拳拳，廣友四方諸俊彥，一書懇懇如當面；何况時同地復同，一堂歡笑聲融融。有善相師過相諫，有力相助財相通；生我父母知我友，鮑管之交緣不偶。尼山友敎徧諸邦，東西南北隨緣走；老安少懷友信之，聖人萬古之宗師。觀音千手復千眼，護持照顧無偏私；孔老耶回趣佛海，此心此理無差池。西方極樂無諸苦，上聖海會光巍巍；同持萬德彌陀號，從此相隨沒別離。黃君交友最篤實傳此一曲巴人詩。</p>
<p>朋友上的幾個問題　耶魯</p>
<p>——爲紀念三三友朋節而作——</p>
<p>今天是第九屆友朋節，過去生活安定，每逢這個節日，也相當熱鬧一番，現在渡日艱難，大家很少情緒舉行集會叙歡了。也正因爲患難時期，不拘形式，而要更加珍視朋友的關係，做到朋友的真諦。</p>
<p>如果把古今關於朋友友道的著述，歸納起來，不出乎忠恕信義仁愛的大道。雖然老生常談，但講到朋友之道，則不能離開這些大道的目標太遠，祇要把舊的道理中狹義的地方做得廣義一些，把不大合乎世情的做得合乎世情，就可盡其能事了。</p>
<p>不想引經據典，且來談談關於朋友上的幾個問題。</p>
<p>（一）寧缺毋濫</p>
<p>一個人應有大的氣量，凡是對於相識的人，都可視爲朋友，不過因爲「近朱者赤，近墨者黑」的關係，有着利害的出入，於是對於朋友「質」的方面的選取，有審愼的必要，還是「寧缺毋濫」的好。古人有言：「得一知己，可以無憾。」知己的結成，由於旨趣性情等的融洽，而大家要得知己朋友的心理是相同的。但一般所謂知已朋友，其性質大有區別，而性質的不同，可以決定時間上的久暫，大概酒肉徵逐中的知己，是歡日無幾的，而以友輔仁的知己，是久而彌堅的。凡是開口知己閉口知己的朋友，不過取悅於人而已。你固然要多得知己朋友，但是要使朋友認爲你是知己，第一需要自己以忠厚眞摯的道理去待朋友，這樣，日久見人心，朋友自會心悅誠服，而受朋友的歡迎，眞心願意跟你結爲知己的朋友。所謂「得道多助，失道寡助」，得失的關鍵，全在乎此。</p>
<p>（二）情感與理智</p>
<p>友誼中的關係，一般以情感的成份居多，但是一味沉沒在情感中，等到超過了限度，就好像脫韁之馬，是相當危險的。往往有種朋友，熱情非常，一旦情感放縱，一致破裂，就視同陌路，多麼可惜！所以單從情感所起的作用維持友誼，實在不甚可靠，它必須配合自己的理智才可「相得益彰」，因為情感有時會虛偽，有時會反常的。譬如男女朋友在戀愛的過程中，雙方的情感無論怎樣親熱，倘使缺少理智的判斷，難免惹起許多麻煩。有理智的男女朋友，要講戀愛而即使「落花有意流水無情」，結果友誼仍能維持，這是多麽可貴。任何事情「過與不及」，都有「物極必反」的結果，情感也是如此，太濃了不好，太淡了也不好　朋友富於情感，固然要緊，但是必要的時候，理智就更重要，因爲它可以把握情感，不使趨於極端。</p>
<p>（三）精明與忠厚</p>
<p>人心不同，各如其面，朋友自然有各種各樣，顯而易見的是「精明」與「忠厚」兩種朋友。不論精明朋友忠厚朋友，於大家都有益處。因爲在精明朋友中可以懂得許多人情世故，在忠厚朋友中可得正直無私的批評以及有裨於爲人的美德。我想，精明朋友如果不會「損人利己」的話，那末用以造福人羣，其成績一定大有可觀。至於忠厚朋友，在這個社會上，幾乎被人視爲好好先生，往往容易被人欺弄。這在被欺者方面，固屬不幸，但是欺侮好人，究竟不是光榮的事！同時，忠厚朋友，因爲本身的老實，也容易上精明朋友的圈套，所以一方面希望大家本發揚友道的精神，要同情忠厚朋友，而在忠厚朋友本身，也要隨時看看客觀的環境。最後希望精明朋友要多注意於學養能力方面，不要專對朋友精明，而流於刻薄自私。</p>
<p>（四）義氣與互助</p>
<p>「祇有千年朋友，沒有千年東家」，這句話雖似過甚，可是朋友的關係勝過東家以及親戚的地方也的確是事實。這便是「義氣」貫流的力量。義氣與朋友是最可寳貴的東西。歷史有許多有名的義氣朋友，眞是義薄雲霄，千古不朽。朋友而有義氣，才能維持久遠，顯其偉大：而義氣之中的互助精神，尤爲可貴，在患難中的互助，更是不可多得的義氣。格言上說：「施在我有餘之惠，則可以廣德；留在人不盡之情，則可以全交。」所以對於朋友可放交情之處應放交情，因爲這是朋友的義氣，互助的條件，而且友誼的日子正長，幫助朋友無異幫助自己，總之，在助人者當視爲這是人類應有的互助精神，是友誼應盡的義務，而在被助者也要有「君子不忘其本」的義氣。</p>
<p>朋友是人生的現實，筆者涉世未深，才淺識薄，所述都是皮毛，且多有未盡之處，這還需要大家指正。</p>

<h3>市商會力謀改革機構　擬將本市三百餘所　同業公會重行調整</h3>
<p>本市華商各團體，對於確立上海經濟自治統制機構一點，分頭努力，尤以市商會之動向最爲積極，各方咸表注目。聞市商會方面擬將本市三百餘所同業公會重行調整，確立上海經濟之自治統制，其主鵠爲以下各點：</p>
<p>獲得指導權</p>
<p>以獲全體同業公會之指導權爲前提，但市商會本身機構先有改革之必要。故市商會方面刻正硏討改革辦法，其改革要點爲脫離自由主義之性格，具備最高統制機構之要素，俾獲得指導權，擴大並加强本身之指導實力。同時，要求國民政府，將指導公會之權限，移交於市商會。</p>
<p>重組單位公會</p>
<p>刻下上海有三百餘所同業公會。但爲統制商品起見，應有　合之公會，亦有分開獨立之公會，以合理統制爲前提，重加調整、現在各公會之性質，爲一種維護同業之組織，亦即自由主義之利益目的團體，故將在其性格上作根本之改變，俾使其發展爲統制上海經濟之單位機構。</p>
<p>設立中間統制機構</p>
<p>將三百有餘之單位同業公會，按其性質予以分類。每一類同業公會中，再設一聯合會，其地位介於單位公會與市商會之中間。</p>
<p>市商會之自治統制案，大體如上。是否能完全實現，又當別論。在大體上似已得到傘商方面之支持。（三月二日大陸新報）</p>
<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3>中國經濟應有　劃時代之轉變</h3>
<p>中國經濟之特質，即中國素來爲世界最大消費之國家，借債度日，年年入超，少則年有一萬餘萬元，多則達八萬除萬元。直至民國二十一年後，國人始漸注意於建設，其幼稚自無待言。處現今商戰劇烈之世界，物競天擇，適者生存，未有專知消費，不務生產之國家，而能生存於寰宇中者。</p>
<p>欲求中國之自力更生，則中國之經濟，應有劃時代之轉變，即由消費之國家，一變而爲生產之國家。過去中國之出口多爲原料食品，而進口則爲製成品，製成品中尤多奢侈品消費品，此完全爲消費國家之表現。雖在二十一年以後，機器工具車輛船艇之進口，漸居重要，而消費品之進口，仍屬不少。中國爲富源獨厚之國家，原料之自供，應使相當足甩，而進口商品自應以輔助生產所必需者爲主要。此其一。</p>
<p>昔人有云，外債可借，而中國不可借外債，此蓋沉痛之語，中國此後苟能善爲利用外資，則外債亦未始不可借。所謂善爲利用外資者，即在不損害中國完整之主權下，以外資輸人生產必需之用品，眞正從事於產業之開發，如是外債可因生產而不久還淸，則利用外資時之人超，暫時亦不足爲病。否則如過去以借債而進口奢侈物品，或甚至用於足以戕害中國生產力之用途，則將水陷中國於消費國之地位，可不深懼。此其二。</p>
<p>中國素來以農立國，據所估計，四萬萬人民中，農民約佔三萬萬人。故農民之生計，是以整個影響中國經濟之命脈。以中國土地之廣大與肥沃，（經濟學上所謂生產之優勢，自在於農，）中國之生產事業，自仍以重農爲主。故於耕種方法之改良，農業質量之增進，以及荒地之開墾更須特加注意，以奠中國生產之根基。此外，再擴及於林藝漁牧等事，國用焉有不足。此其三。</p>
<p>此外主要重工業，務必自求完備。爲人民生活國家生存所寄之物品，務須自廠製造。交通須闢，礦源須開。所謂以農立國，並非全不注意於工礦，不過以此爲輔耳。此其四。</p>
<p>以上四端，僅其犖犖大者，欲求其實現，政府應有整個詳細之計劃與政策。應國營者國營，應民營者由政府保障其相當之利益而加以獎勵。人民應去其過去吃慣用慣之陋習，刻苦耐勞，團結合作，各努力於本位之工作，各盡其國民一份子之責任。則四萬萬中，本有大半爲消費者，可盡變爲四萬寓生產之國民。中國經濟必有此劃時代之轉變，方足以言新中國之產生。</p>

<h3>日政府堅持原價計算制度　鈴木企劃院總裁剴切說明</h3>
<p>日本方面鋻於產業力量為增强戰力之根幹，產業體制之强化確立，爲當務之急，頃乘議會之機會，重再愼重檢討，二十四日之貴院戰時行政特例法案委員會上，伍堂卓雄氏提出關於原價計算制度之質問，當由鈴木企劃院總裁詳加解答釋明，誤解當局緩和原價計算之心理，因是消除。</p>
<p>伍堂卓雄氏：上次在衆院會議預算委員長報吿時。曾提出關於原價計算之質問，而政府之答語認爲此事旣不可全部中止，亦未便全面行施，因而世人對於此點，誤解當局有緩和原價計算制度之心理，擬乘此機會，再明其究竟。</p>
<p>鈴木企劃院總裁：此項問題以物價問題爲中心，堅持低物慣政策，增加生產，此即原價計算與物價問題發生關係之來由，政府決心堅持低物價政策，同時力求生產擴充，爲使各項產業合理化，並謀提高能率起見，當有堅持原價計算制度之必要，國民對於物價之感覺如何，即可反映此項價格施行後之羣衆心理，產業界人士應以國家爲本位，如有脫除一切貿利之性格，則原價計算制度即無必要，但民間經濟就過去之情形而觀，尚無法達到脫除貿利性格，故無意緩和原價計算制度，視情勢之如何而適當處理。</p>
<p>伍堂卓雄氏：世人誤解總裁之言，則原價計算，與其認爲是規定價格，毋寗云是爲增進能率，物價指數之伸縮，除以原價計算外別無他途，此爲原價計算之必要點。</p>
<p>鈴木總裁：爲求自低能率做至高能率，故利用原價計算一事，較之規定價格重要。</p>
<p>伍堂卓雄氏：過有即有原價計算制度行施。在原價計算中，頗有出入，凡屬接受補助金之基礎產業方面，必須令其遵照原價計算制度，更不得不全面採用原價計算制度，但單一原價計算並不　宜，決不容許緩和原價計算制度。</p>
<p>鈴木總栽：根本無緩和原價計算之意向，當以不背現實之原則維持原價計算制度。</p>
<p>伍堂氏與鈴木總裁質疑完畢後，復向陸海軍當局質詢其見解，當由陸海軍省經理局長分別答辯如次：</p>
<p>栗林陸軍省經理局長：刻下陸軍當局　實勵行原價計算制度，成績異常良好，深感原價計算制度爲擴充生產力所最必要者，總之陸軍當局更將逐步加强原價計算制度，爲合理化之生產而努力。</p>
<p>武井海軍省經理局長：關於勵行原價計算制度一事，海軍亦抱與陸軍同樣之主張，此項制度爲增進能率之唯一方法，海軍所轄之工廠，遠在二十年即行此種辦法，迄今未稍更張，今後自當加緊努力普及此項制度。（二月二十五日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>為减少人民無謂消費　日本增加非必需品稅捐</h3>
<p>東京三有一日海通社電　自本大藏省為减少日本人民在無謂消耗方面之購買力起見。業自今日起，增加各項稅捐。所有奢侈物品之稅捐，已增至百分之十至八十（以前爲百分之十至五十），餐館飯捐，增加亦多，旅館賬捐，以前爲百分之二十至三十，現已增爲百分之二十至五十。其他如煤氣，電影，戲院，以及一切娛樂捐，亦均有顯著之增加云。</p>
<h3>廢止進出口移動限制　對經濟界有極好影響　首藤氏視察華北歸來談</h3>
<p>橫濱正金銀行上海分行副經理首藤氏，最近赴華北，滿洲視察經濟，歷時一月有餘，業已公畢返滬，一日下午四時三十分在該行向記者稱：華北之通貨物價，及收購物資，均頗順利。抑平物價，收買物資之二大問題，已於二月中旬起實行，天津，北京兩地之輸出入限制廢除後，情况漸見轉好。首藤在下列談話中，對於華中之收買物資，抑平物價等項辦法，頗多暗示，渠認爲北京，天津兩地廢除物資進出口限制後，收買物資與抑平物價方面，均吿好轉，蓋取消限制後，凡受統制之商品，無須當局之許可，即能自由進出，（但特種商品除外）故華方一致表示好感。該處取消限制後之物資配給與收買機構，刻在準備中，一俟就緒，則配給與收買事宜統能由一定之機構辦理，物資自能暢通，此種情形，在上海亦然，如能開關物資流通之道，在可能範圍以內，自由處理物資之配給與收貝，則物資當可暢通，物價亦得漸平。如華中之米價與華北小麥價格低落，則其他物價亦能趨平。華北全部物資之供應，以各地收買機構爲中心，從事搜購棉花，小麥等項重要農產，棉花，小麥之供應極爲順利。關於金融通貨工作，聯銀券在華北一帶普遍流通，深得民衆信賴。流通數額相當龐大，一切物資均以聯銀券交易，聯合準備銀行之分行與辦事處，達三十餘處之多，此外尙有華北省銀行及其他華方銀仃，一致協助聯銀券工作。日圓與聯銀券之比率原則，絕無變動云。（譯自三月二日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>上海交易所復業問題</h3>
<p>上海本來有交易所二處，一爲中國方面的華商證券交易所，另一爲洋商的（英美爲主）上海衆業公所。前者雖有股票交易所之名，但無中國企業資本的交易市塲之實，而惟從事於波濤汹湧的公債投機，卒致自趨沒落。後者所交易的，有三十八種的橡膠，拓殖股，以至於，紡績船渠，銀行，保隊等屬於在華外人的股票一百五十五種。這二個交易所，自日軍進駐租界以來，即陷於停閉的命運中。</p>
<p>但上海有價證券的交易，決不因上述二交易所的停閉而絕跡，事變後用搜購外滙，外股，存軟於外國銀行等秘種方法企圖逃避資金的有力遊資方面，隨着外商勢力的消滅，遂轉而搜購華股，以至在兩交易所以外的大小交易市塲上，引起了不正當的股票價格飛漲。各種股票的種數亦見驟增，大東亞戰後交易的家數自十九家驟增至百二十八家。這種極不健全的狀態，因遊資的增大，而愈激烈化，於是在去年末，遂聲明允許股票交易所復業的方針。</p>
<p>關於交易所復業問題，首先於去年十月三十日，據興亞院當局談話如次。衆業公所置於軍管理下復業，在興亞院華中連絡部之下，允許華商股票，中央地方公債的交易，以期由此復興和平地區的經濟。所以像以前那樣的投機，將採嚴厲取締的方針。其次，在十二月二日，上海大使館事務所發表關於交易員及登塲物件的申請。登塲物件暫時祇以華商股票爲限，視開業後的狀况再定其他各種證券公債之登塲、希望誘導　資進入重要　業部門。</p>
<p>上　上海交易所復業的發表，雖在關係各方面引起了很大的反響，而切待其實現，上海交易所遲遲迄今未見復業，並據傳有若—轇轕，大槪因爲實行的時候將發生種種困難的問題。在上海設置有價證券取引所，不僅對於將來，即在當前的現實問題上，亦有必要。當局所正式發表的各點，不能視為就此永無下文。將來終將採取各種措置而實現。現在假定離開這一問題，來看上海交易所在大東亞戰爭下具何任務？</p>
<p>據大使館的發表看來，上海交易所的復業，其目的在使股票價格在適當的管理下，誘導民族資本進入於必要的產業部面。硏究開業後的狀况，不僅以華商股票爲限，並將及於其他各種證券公債恐連中支那振興諸關係的諸會社，橡膠股，及其他諸日本股票等亦均在內。舉凡在共榮圈內的各重要產業，投資，如單憑交易所的復業，恐難完成，因爲中國的利率高至百分三十，所以白分之五六的分紅，不够成爲投資的對象。假令以資金作爲投機的運用，其結果必使此種股票的買賣大爲盛行，然而此種風氣，亦必波及其他地域，仍非好的現象。欲導資金入於必要的產業部面，無論用何方法，在目前的戰時狀况下，不是所應課於上海交易所的任務。</p>
<p>其次，中國人所經營的諸產業的資金供給如何呢？現在所謂華股的猛烈搜求，與諸企業的業務並無關係。例如紡織事業，因原棉補充的不充分，動力的供給亦無轉佳之望，銷路也愈狹隘，所以其前途決無樂覜的理由。然而紡織股却正在異常的昂騰中。各書局的出版物幾已杜絕，然而文化關係股亦同樣高漲。投資的對象不視其本身的業務、而視其資產的價値爲選擇的標準。</p>
<p>不僅如此，在上述困難的生產狀况下，各股票反多實行增資。於去年下半期增產的華人企業約五十家，其甚者在二年問竟增資至二十四倍。增資的主要理由為物價暴騰，資產額的膨脹及舊資本的跳躍。中國本來除紡織，製粉等以外，幾無像樣的產業，加以上述的華股實况下，殊不能用先進國導入產業資金的尺度來看待上海的交易所。所以目前交易所的復業，應以採取如何對付投機，與刺激遊　膨脹的對策爲目標。交易所的復業，雖不能希望誘導遊資進人民族資本，然假使能够藉此稍煞股票市塲的投機，已可說是非常的收獲。動員上海市塲的生產資金，爲今後所應籌劃的急務。倘有中國方面的合作，更可採取大胆的手段。（宋鴻翔譯自「東洋經濟」二月一十日第二〇六〇號）</p>

<h3>由企業的苦悶　論今後企業的前途</h3>
<p>在第一卷第六期的「企業週刊」裏面，郭祖孝先生有一篇論著，題目叫做「企業的苦悶」。在這一篇文字中，郭先生用極有系統的筆調，寫出了當前企業界的種種苦悶，代表企業界喊出了他們心頭的　鬱。現在，在這重重苦悶中，我們已經看到了光明的途徑：循著這途徑，我們便能够到達光明的彼岸，祇要看我們有沒有走這一條途徑的決心和怎樣走這一條途徑。這一條途徑是什麼？就是二月十二日國民政府全國經濟委員會第一次全體會議所製定的戰時經濟政策綱領</p>
<p>戰時經濟政策綱領的通過，是國民政府宣佈對英美參戰後最重大的成就；雖然，政府對於經濟以外的其他各部份，如政治，軍事，敎育等等，也必將逐一按照參戰後情勢的需要而製定各種適合戰時的政策綱領，但鑒於民生問題是一切問題的最終目的，我們站在工商企業界的立塲，說戰時經濟政策綱領的通過，是超越一切的偉大成就，自然是　不會太過的。</p>
<p>戰時經濟政策綱要共計五項二十二條，沒有一條不針對着當前經濟界的缺點，也沒有一條不適合當前經濟界的需要。可以說是醫治企業界苦悶的一帖淸凉方劑。但是：我們要知道，定方針易，定了方針一定還要繼續不斷的實踐，才能够收到預期的效果，這效果是努力實踐的代價。</p>
<p>從當局的製定和頒佈這戰時經濟政策綱領，我們很明顯的可以看出當局的決心來，但是，光是靠當局的有決心還是不够的，要使實踐的過程中事半功倍，必須有賴於民間——尤其是工商企業界的合作。</p>
<p>因此，我不能不先談物價問題了。物價問題是一切經濟問題的基幹，全部戰時經濟政策綱領，所解決的目的無非還是一箇物價問題：唯有在物價穗定的前得之下，一切經濟設施和各種正當事業，才能够在穩定中求得它正當充實的發展，然後，我們才能够準確地控制着我們的事業。試問：我們是不是需要這樣的一箇環境和局面呢？</p>
<p>工商企業的最好發展是像上面所說那樣的在穩定中的發展。單倚靠物價上漲而關着門獲利的實例雖然到處皆是，但是那是假性的利潤。現階段的囤戶心理以爲持有物資總比持有貨幣或存軟來得有價値，他們有根本看不起貨幣或存款信用的謬見：實不知貨幣或存款價値的貶低，却由於物資價値的高漲。目前在華中華南二區域內所流行的通貨是儲備券，儲備券的　行年來雖有增加，但從大量的舊法幣之被收回和禁止使用，以及儲備券流行區域的日益擴大，可以見到它的發行程度並沒有達到泛濫的境地，並且相反的，我們却看到一種人爲的緊縮。那種人爲的緊縮，它的手段是一方面緊縮中央儲備銀行對於同業間的放款，一方面督促同業把存款準備金的法定部分解繳到中央儲備銀行來，以使儲備券的回流；它的目的是想利用這一種緊縮通貨發行的方法，造成市面上銀根的緊迫，來抑制這一種投機囤貨的風氣。誰知市面上的銀根果然緊迫了，這種投機囤貨的心理却依舊不容易消滅。可知欲求物價問題的合理解決，單純從通貨方面着手是不够的。這種投機囤貨的風氣，泛濫而成　社會上普通的囤貨心理以後，不僅一般工商界不願大量出售他們的商品，而且民間各階層都不願保持他們的購買力而急於購入不急需的物資，使工商界產生了即使肯買出商品也有售出了不能再以原價補進的苦衷。於是：抬價，搶購，以有限的物資，供無饜的取求，物價便在生產力，運輸力之外的原因裏更快地上升了。這樣的惡性循環造成了以後，多數人的精力，都耗費在不必要的浪費裏，於是：形成生產能力的萎縮，又造成一個惡性循環。物價這樣的繼續不斷的上漲上去，人人心理中都存　物價還要上漲的錯覺，却不知這種心理就是促成物價上漲的重要因素之一。於是：今天甲手頭有了若干貨幣，便用來向乙購入物資：明天乙又用貨幣向內購買物資，丙向丁，丁向戊，這大家都只想購入物資，又大家都只把利潤加在物資上面，物價固然循此上漲下去，銀根却也因此更緊起來，這是物價與通貨關係的另一面</p>
<p>物價的上漲，旣然形成幣値的低落：幣値的低落，又復形成工商業開支的膨漲。今日的工商業，難然可以關着門不做生意而賺錢，但總必須售出他的一部分貨物才能彌補它的龐大開支。若這樣的情形繼續下去不變的話，總有一天把手頭的存貨完全變作了開支而消耗光了；甚至於手頭祇保存了一箇單位的貨物，算起賬面價値來還是超過資本幾千倍呢。這樣的情形，只希望籍物價上漲而坐獲厚利而不圖從自己的本位上服務社會的囤戶們，您們有沒有想到呢？</p>
<p>我們旣然知道因物價上升而發生的利潤，不是眞性的利潤，便當根本鏟除這種囤貨居奇的心理，把物價穩定在現在的水準面。然後，在當局的監督指導之下，根據戰時經濟政策綱領中所定的方針，各人盡各人的心力，各人從各人自己的本位，致力於生產，運輸，分配等機構的改進。從此以後，消費者不再購買需用量以上的或是不急需的物資，工商企業界不再把有用的精力和時間浪費在旣成物資的輾轉受投間，並且不再把存貨售給意　囤積的奸商，大家都把戰時經濟政策綱領當作一面鏡子，把責人的勇氣用來資己，那末，眼前的企業雖然是充滿着苦悶，企業前途的光明，也許就近在目前了。（陸廷芳）</p>

<p>林康侯氏，江蘇上海人，現年六十八歲。氏幼年思想新頴。成年後，以改進敎育爲己任，曾創辦南洋公學附屬小學，長斯校者十年。生平作育人才甚多，歷來社會知名之士，出其門下者，頗不乏人。江浙兩省舉辦滬杭鐵路時，氏主其事。旋爲金融界所延攬，任新華儲蓄銀行上海行經理之職。民十後，改就上海中華滙業銀行經理，同時以服務社會爲先提，嘗參加上海各社團如慈善公益商業團體等等。民國十六年國民政府成立，氏主持上海商會，任主席委員。越一年，兼任全國商會聯合會主席。其時，上海銀行公會延爲秘書長，迄今十有七年。民二十五年，出任暹邏（耶今之泰國）考察團副團長。二十七年，出席第二十四屆國際勞工大會及第十六屆世界紅十字會代表大會，並曾遊展英美德義等國，閱半年餘歸國。去春由港返滬，本其素志，爲社會服務，仍任銀行公會秘書長，及其他慈善公益事業要職。</p>
<p>林氏體氣得天獨厚，生平絕少疾病。凡事向抱樂觀，故無疾言厲色，待人接物，和靄可親。平日起身甚早，凡有會議以及宴會，雖逢事繁，亦必躬與。喜飲酒，但不過量。六十歲時，即摒除紙烟。暇時恒以臨池爲樂，求者甚多。書學李北海，頗秀逸。</p>
<p>林氏鑒於以前在會銀行僅有五十餘家，今日已有一百二十餘家，認爲此種進展，實爲中國銀行史所罕見，並認爲應當如何植其基礎，庶克長保中國金融界之繁榮。此爲從事銀行業者，値得硏究之問題。林氏以爲銀行之從業人員，殊感供不應求，其中稱職者固多，濫竽者亦不在少，往往在應付顧客及辦事手續方面，均覺欠缺，亟應早加訓練，庶可希望業務上之發展。又言銀行營業時間，一至三時，即覺無所事事，此項時間上之消耗，豈是古人惜陰之道。各行當局應注意於員生之業餘時間，俾在技術與學養上多多訓導灌輸，同時爲銀行養成　行專門人才，否則徒爲消費事業添一主顧，流弊所屆，固不能因其細微而忽視。林氏對於物品統制問題，認爲原則固佳，惟在中國，以地方遼闊，習慣不同，必須因地制宜，方能收效。所以對於必需品之統制方法，認爲尙須硏究改進，以期盡善。關於已在實施統制中之物品，認爲應當切實取締黑市。以維民生。</p>

<h3>為生活而奮鬥</h3>
<p>— 物競</p>
<p>和幾個薪水階級的朋友一起談天，談來談去，不外是一「生活難」一套窮話。</p>
<p>恰巧窗外樹上，有一對鳥在歌唱一個朋友聽了，很感喟地說：「你們聽，這兩隻鳥的生活，多麼愉快！唉，我們雖然是萬物之靈的人類，倒不及他們的自由自在呢！」</p>
<p>同座的朋友們聽了，都點頭贊同，恨不得立刻羽化，也到樹枝上去歌唱。</p>
<p>文學家們，在他們的作品裏，常常贊美鳴禽游魚的洒脫，自然。我們讀好的詩歌，常因詩人頌贊魚鳥而生「超然出塵」「飄飄欲仙」之感。</p>
<p>人們爲了生活，或者仰人鼻息，或者伺候顏色，或者東奔西走，或者哄詐嚇騙，勞心勞形，忙忙碌碌，委實是不容易，何况處此非常時期？因生活困難而羨慕鳴禽游魚，亦是人情之常。</p>
<p>不過，我們從生物學的立塲來講，這觀念就錯誤了。據生物學家的硏究，凡是生物，爲了生活都須奮鬥；越是高等的生物，生活越是複雜，謀生也越是困難。</p>
<p>我們看鳴禽游魚，似乎自由自在，其實他們爲了尋食，爲了覓偶，爲了禦敵，也不知花費幾許精神。何嘗能逍遙自在？什麼「鳥樂」「魚樂」，不過是人的主觀罷了。如果鳴禽和游魚，果眞充滿愉快，那麼「驚弓之鳥」，「城門失火，殃及池魚」等話，將作何解說呢？</p>
<p>總之，除非不做生物則已，如果要做生物，尤其是高等生物，非爲生活而奮鬥不可。目前社會，雖多不合理之處，但須我們去奮鬥改進，絕不能頹唐消極以不了了之的。</p>
<h3>漫談失眠症</h3>
<p>— 鐘忍</p>
<p>這年頭兒失眠症可以說是一種普遍的流行病，尤其是在知識分子和薪給階級中。</p>
<p>知識分子（包含薪給階級）的腦本是經過特殊訓練，善於思慮的機構。在平日生活安定的時候，他們的思慮不外工作和學識兩個範圍，現在生活程度高得驚人，使他們的腦中添了一個難以解決的生活問題，好像鐘錶機件中多了一根纏繞的頭髮絲，自然要使他們煩惱憂慮，久而久之就成了所謂失眠。</p>
<p>失眠十九是精神上的病症，只要看勞力的失眠症患者百不得一就可證明。生病時唯一的辦法就是請敎醫生，失眠時最好自然也是請醫生診斷，因爲肉體上的病症也能引起失眠。然而，假使你的失眠是由於精神上的不安，醫生並不能給你多大的幫助，他至多祇能吿訴你一些自療的方法。</p>
<p>要治療失眠症，起睡須有定時，晚上要在一定的時間就寢，早上要在一定的時間起床，這是治療失眠症的先決條件，患者必須養成良好的睡眠習慣。</p>
<p>休息是安眠的主要因素，就寢時全身的神經和肌肉須同時鬆弛，不可緊張。當腦筋高速度工作的時候身體不能得到需要的休息，這就是知識分子常患失眠的原因。</p>
<p>肉體上的疲勞不能單獨的使人入睡，脚踏車耐久賽的與賽員能在脚踏車上連坐五六天，這幾天中他載有每次半小時的睡眠，同時還要努力的奮鬬，我們總以爲他比賽結束後一定要大睡幾天，然而事實上他要在結束後十餘小時才能入睡，因爲他已刺激過度，他的神經和肌肉尙在緊張狀態中，須俟神經和肌肉鬆弛後才能照常入睡。</p>
<p>有些人常說：「我晚上一點也睡不着。」他並不覺得自己的話有些過分，世上決沒有一點也睡不着的人。有點小病小痛的人常常喜歡把自己的病痛說得過分，假使他說：「我昨夜祇睡了兩小時。」事實上他大概是睡了三小時或四小時，但是每次二三十分鐘，間斷而不連續的睡眠不能完全恢復人體的疲勞則是事實。</p>
<p>又有些人往往說：「我每天一定要到很晚的時候才能入睡，早晨很早很早就要醒來」。這人的失眠常常是由於心理作用，他自以爲一定要到兩點半才能入睡，結果他非到兩點半不能入睡，他自以爲四點半一定就要醒來，結果他就在四點半醒來。</p>
<p>自以爲不能安睡的人十九不能安睡，這有些像催眠術一樣，因爲他相信自己睡不着，所以他就睡不着了。無論肉體上有沒有病態，失眠的治療和患者精神上的態度有重大的關係。</p>
<p>假使你能排除煩心的事，閉上眼安心的休息，失眠並沒有什麼影響。最不好的就是煩心，假使你今天睡眠不足但是並未煩心，明天你就可以補上睡眠的不足，祇要你能排除煩心的事，失眠就不足爲慮。</p>
<p>然而在目前的情形之下，大多數人都有許多煩心的事。去年暑天本市曾發現霍亂傷寒等傳染病，幸得工部局厲行防疫，未成大患。假使有人能發明一種手術，把目前多數人失眠的病根一刀割去，那眞是阿彌陀佛，功德無量。</p>
<h3>根</h3>
<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>『我已經和黃老爺講好了，』楊老爺端起蓋碗茶，喝了一口，但茶並不能有助於他的喉嚨，他們發出來的聲音，還是啞澀之至，『黃老爺看你實在苦，！』</p>
<p>「是，是。」退了二步。</p>
<p>「黃老爺也看我的　面，！』</p>
<p>『是，是。』又退了二步。</p>
<p>『總算已經答應買你的田，！』</p>
<p>『是，是。』已退得很遠，不知要退到那裏去。</p>
<p>『根明，你就這裏坐下吧，』在他的身後，有人在對他說。</p>
<p>『是，是。』他一面應着，一面回過身來，一看，那是一個面孔很白，年齡和他相仿的人，便接着說：『篤周先生，這樣大冷天，累你來，眞正對不起。』</p>
<p>說着，他就在篤周先生旁邊的一張圓凳上坐了下來。</p>
<p>『黃老爺說，』啞澀的喉曨還在嚮着，『那塊什麼田，！』</p>
<p>『老石頭，』根明應着。</p>
<p>『那塊老石頭，就作價大洋五十元。』</p>
<p>『是，是。』習慣地應了兩聲，可是立刻若有所悟地改口說：『不過，不過，…』</p>
<p>不過什麼，我橫說豎說，黃老爺總算看我的薄面，又加　四元，共五十四元，那總好了。』</p>
<p>『不過，不過，…』當然不以爲然，但是也說不下去。</p>
<p>『大洋五十四元，還不好嗎？』</p>
<p>『不過，不過，…』</p>
<p>楊老爺不再說什麼，捧了黃老爺遞給他的水烟袋也咕嚕嚕地吸起來。</p>
<p>根明『不過』了一會，也就不再『不過』下去，他在想，想用什麼話，可以增加幾元錢。</p>
<p>忽然，在靠窗的賬桌上，有一個人回過了身，拔出了嘴裏的香烟，噴完了所吸進去的烟氣，淡淡的說：『老根，是你要賣田麼？』</p>

<h3>不相稱的吃</h3>
<p>— 天明繪</p>
<h3>一月份徵文錄取第八名　我的生活（上）</h3>
<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>—店員生活的一斑—</p>
<p>此時執筆寫文的我，是在一爿錢莊上當「起碼」的職員。但過去，却不是「科班」出身，拜過師，當過三年學徒；說來慚愧，以前我也曾靠着筆桿兒吃飯，充過所謂「無冕之王」的新聞記者，但忽然「半途出家」，投筆　與算盤，數目字結起不解緣來，這完全是「時代」和「環境」在作祟，連我自己也像是做夢一般，身不由主。</p>
<p>我生在江蘇江北岸一個古城的中產家庭裏，父母結婚二十多年，生下我弟，兄，姊，妹，一共十個，我是「長子」，這樣「兒女滿堂」，別人口頭常稱爲「福氣」的，在我父親却是個够重的負担，也因此，他對於「長子」的期望很大。他想把我造就成一個人材，好替他肩一部份的担子；但以經濟力量的有限，只能供給我到「高中」畢業爲止，大學便上不起了。升學旣無指望，惟有到社會上來找飯碗，但我那時不過一個十八歲的中學生，在「人浮於事」的職業界中，找飯碗實在不容易；「賦閑」在家，精神苦悶無從發洩，便借筆桿兒消遣，時常投稿到本地一家報館裏，蒙那位編輯先生的「靑眼」，我的蹩腳文章，居然常在報紙上出現。稿費當然很有限，但後來，那位編輯竟和我結爲「文字之交」。他向報館的社長舉薦，邀我去編「副刊」。待遇也很低，但却供給膳宿；那時年輕好事，發表慾非常旺盛，一旦「榮任」編輯，執剪刀漿糊而衡文，大有「南面王」似的高興，待遇菲薄，也不放在心上。可惜一好夢不長，我在二十歲上和一個不相識的女子結了婚，結婚之後，「家計」日　，報館裏拿的幾個錢實不够用，父親和妻也不贊成我老幹這個，恰巧「××鐵路局」車務處招考候補車務員，有個在路局服務的親戚寫信喊我到上海來應考試，徼倖給我考取了。但我忍痛「割愛」辭掉編輯職務到「路局」受訓練的第二個月上，却不幸地發生了戰事，我們那個訓練班隨即解散。從此跟着家庭輾轉避難，過着驚恐，流離，不安定的生活，直到前年下半年才復回到秩序已經恢復的故鄕來。我仍然是「失業閑居，然而生活程度的飛漲不容我從容覓得適當的職業，於是靠着親戚的情面，我便「飢不擇食」似地混進錢莊裏來了。</p>
<p>說到錢莊，一般認爲是僅次於銀行的商業中的「神經中樞」，有的是錢，對於職員的生活待遇，比較他業優厚得多，而且工作輕鬆，辦公有一定的鐘點，這誠然是事實，然而在錢莊裏服務的靑年，總覺得有許多地方不滿足。老實說，我也是「不滿足的一個。這固然由於靑年缺少工作的耐心，見異思遷，好新厭舊，但這種「寫意」生活也自有其本身的缺點，「無庸諱言」的。試分幾點來說：</p>
<h3>略談藝術教育</h3>
<p>— 勃克</p>
<p>粗濫的攝製，惑人的鏡頭，可以代表現在大多數的影戲；荒謬的結構，誇張的演出，可以代表現在大多數的話劇，趣味的提倡，噱頭的賣弄，可以代表現在大多數的雜誌。在牠們裏面，找不出藝術。</p>
<p>我不知道主辦牠們的人，懂不懂藝術。如果懂的，也許有什麼不得已，只好當作不懂，而不表現眞正的藝術吧。如果不懂、那當然就更加不必談了。</p>
<p>他們現在所表現出來的這樣的藝術，如果沒有眞正的藝術敎育　加以指導·補·糾正，我們的藝術將要流入怎樣的地步呢？我想，誰也不能否認，我們的藝術，必然要倒退三五十年，弄到不知所云的地步，直等將來的有心人，再來從頭幹起。這眞是一個絕大的浪費！</p>
<p>現在如果有能够從事眞正藝術敎育的，那末，不論機關或個人，我們總是歡迎的吧，對於牠們或他們的事業，總是願意與以一臂之助，使之早觀厥成的吧。同時，喜歡藝術的靑年，總更願意受到這種敎育的吧。</p>
<p>最近看到了（中藝）月刋，又到牠的出版者，「中國藝術學院」去參觀了一次，叫我發生了不少的感想。當今之世，一窠風地只知道在影戲·話劇·雜誌上賺錢，誰還注意到藝術和藝術敎育。但是我相信他們的工作是可以寳貴的，將來必定會有事實來告訴我們。</p>
<p>不過，我們旣不能不有眞正的藝術，更不能不有積極的藝術敎育，而偌大上海，却只有這一些人從事於此，那得不使我感慨於無窮呢！（酬栘助學金）</p>

<h3>Improving the Lives of Civil Servants</h3>
<p>Civil servants are the actual implementers of national policies, so their lives are closely related to national policies and the people's livelihood. If we want to improve administrative efficiency, we must first improve and guarantee the lives of civil servants at all levels across the country.</p>
<p>The lives of civil servants can be roughly divided into three types: The first type are those who are both honest and capable. They only know how to be loyal to the country and serve the people. However, they end up with nothing to their name, unable to adequately support their parents and unable to adequately raise their wives and children. They embrace the principle of "a gentleman being steadfast in poverty" without diminishing their joy. The second type are those who both fulfill their duties and seek personal gain. This type of person has occupied a very high position in Chinese politics in recent decades. However, only a very few lucky ones can maintain their position without falling. Most people, due to seeking personal gain, initially only supplement their insufficient income, then gradually become greedy, and eventually suffer personal ruin and disgrace. The third type are those who only know how to seek personal gain and do not know how to handle affairs. They even engage in activities that harm the country and the people. Many of the country's good laws and policies are ruined by these individuals.</p>
<p>Today, when we advocate for improving and guaranteeing the lives of civil servants, the first priority is to thoroughly eliminate, in a negative sense, those civil servants who only take money and do not handle affairs, and absorb truly talented people from all fields to replace them. In a positive sense, we must improve their treatment so that they can maintain the minimum living standards for themselves and their families, and then hold them accountable for fulfilling their duties. The second priority is to do everything possible to improve the situation of civil servants who both handle affairs and seek personal gain, increase their salaries and allowances so that they can devote all their efforts to serving the country and the people. The third priority is to reward the aforementioned first-class excellent civil servants, regardless of whether their position is as high as a specially appointed official or as low as a clerk, as long as they are honest and devoted to public service, they should be given special rewards and publicly praised as model civil servants, while also guaranteeing their adequate living standards materially. These are the principles we advocate for improving and guaranteeing the lives of civil servants.</p>
<p>Regarding the actual living conditions of civil servants across the country at present, almost all of them feel that their income is insufficient to cover their expenses due to rising prices. Although some agencies have special allowances, they cannot keep up with the rate of price increases in reality. In other words, the salaries of all civil servants are insufficient to maintain their minimum living standards. Those at the top can only make ends meet, and it is already difficult to support their families. Those in the middle and lower ranks cannot even maintain their own lives, let alone support their families and educate their children. Their material lives are already difficult, and there is no spiritual comfort at all. Even if they were like Yan Hui, they might not be able to "not change their joy." As a result, most of them have a "five-day plan" mentality and no longer focus on political affairs.</p>
<p>We hope that the government will immediately find ways to improve the treatment of civil servants. It should re-determine the amount of salaries and allowances at all levels, using local price indexes as the standard, so that at least all levels of civil servants can support their families and educate their children. At the same time, it should enhance their self-esteem spiritually, so that they feel the weight of the country's trust and everyone strives to be devoted to public service.</p>
<p>Finally, we urge the government to absolutely prohibit senior civil servants from engaging in business and strictly prohibit the extravagant lifestyles of high-ranking officials. This will create a new atmosphere in politics, and then political efficiency will inevitably increase as a result. Only then can we adapt to wartime needs, implement the country's wartime policies, and accomplish the important mission of participating in the war.</p>
<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3>Soong Mei-ling's Trip to America</h3>
<p>In the Casablanca conference, the United Kingdom and the United States decided to focus their main efforts on the European theater, while taking a defensive stance in the Pacific. Australia and Chongqing have expressed great dissatisfaction with this. Roosevelt explained the Casablanca decision on Lincoln's Birthday on the 12th of last month, saying that the specific plans for the future are not limited to a certain battlefield, continent, or body of water. Many other matters were also decided at the meeting, and within the next year, the world will receive answers not in words, but in actions. Soong Mei-ling's brief ten-day trip to Washington was to explore the details of the conference.</p>
<p>Based on its experiences in the South Pacific War, the United States understands that in order to attack the Japanese mainland, it must use China as the base for its offensive against Japan. China's importance is increasing due to strategic changes. The question is when to start the attack on Japan.</p>
<p>Chongqing's anxiety, impatience, and resentment are all because American aid is lip service and not substantial. Soong Tzu-wen called out first, followed by Soong Mei-ling's trip to America. During her previous trip to America, Soong Mei-ling brought back a gift of a 500 million USD loan. In Chongqing, Soong Mei-ling is revered as the "Mother of the Nation." In the United States, she and Eleanor Roosevelt are praised as "great women in the world symbolizing democracy and freedom." Therefore, Soong Mei-ling's sudden trip to America is based on this self-confidence.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's opinion on the offensive against Japan is completely consistent with Chongqing's; it is only a matter of time. This time can only be sought from God, praying for its speedy arrival. Everything is entrusted to God and used as an excuse for evasion. We can learn Roosevelt's true face beneath his disguise from Soong Mei-ling's activities in America.</p>
<p>We are extremely dissatisfied to hear the American press corps' question, saying that "China has not yet fully utilized its human resources." The method that the United States hopes for Chinese people to bleed for America is for Chongqing to use flesh bombs, without American weapons, to fight against the Japanese army. This question simply treats Chinese people as American slaves. What an insult this is to the Chinese people! However, Soong Mei-ling remained indifferent. She replied, "Many Chinese people are fighting with bare hands." This is truly a cup of bitter wine.</p>
<p>The essence of the relationship between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek is fully exposed in this exchange. Chongqing is the United States' cannon fodder, and the Chongqing regime has sold out the blood of the Chinese people. After Soong Mei-ling returns to Chongqing, she may feel disappointed and resentful, and the gift she brings back from the United States will probably be the awakening of the nations of East Asia.

<p>Eastern Battlefield Ice and Snow Melting German Army Counterattacks in the South Soviet Forces Halted West of Kharkov (Soviet Tank Corps Commander Pavlov Killed)</p>
<p>German Headquarters, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency: German war reports state that the German army launched several counterattacks in the southern sector of the Eastern Front yesterday. The German army in the area severely attacked the Soviet army, destroying the enemy's attempts to advance. Although the climate and terrain in the Izium area are unfavorable for troop movement, the German army still defeated the Soviet army, captured many locations, and the number of captured enemy soldiers and spoils of war is increasing daily. Lieutenant General Pavlov, commander of the 25th Soviet Tank Corps, was killed in action. The Soviet forces attacking west of Kharkov, north of Orel, and south of Lake Ilmen failed in their attempts and retreated with heavy losses. The Demiansk bridgehead southeast of Lake Ilmen, a position that the Soviet army has repeatedly besieged and attempted to capture unsuccessfully for fourteen months, was recently abandoned by the German army according to a pre-planned schedule. Before the German army withdrew, it transported all its military supplies out, and encountered no enemy resistance during the withdrawal.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, February 1st, Allied News Agency: According to information received here today, the large-scale Soviet winter counteroffensive has now weakened because the ice and snow on the battlefield are melting earlier than usual. The German army holds the advantage in three main battle areas. The first is in northern Ukraine and near Kharkov and Kursk, where General Golikov's troops were severely damaged by the German army. The second is in the Donets Basin, where the German side has been continuously sending tank formations and mechanized units. The third is west of Rostov, where the German army has launched a strong counterattack on the Tank Long and Mius River.</p>
<p>Berlin, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency: There are three main wars on the Eastern Front recently: (1) The German army's attack on Izium is progressing smoothly. (2) The Soviet army's progress northwest of Kharkov has been curbed. (3) The Soviet army's pressure on the southern flank of our defense line in Orel has been ineffective. In addition, the vanguard of the German army in the central Donets has now reached northwest of Kramatorskaya and north of Roso. Fierce street fighting is currently taking place in Babenkvo, and the Soviet army is about to be surrounded and annihilated. The Soviet army is still resisting fiercely along the Donets, with many soldiers but very few tanks. From February 21st to February 28th, the Soviet army lost more than 1,060 tanks, which shows that the Soviet army is feeling a shortage of tanks. The Soviet army's attack on Mius seems to be to relieve the urgency in Izium, but it has not succeeded. The Soviet army's progress in the Gonopura area has also been curbed.</p>
<p>Berlin, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency: Military sources in Berlin said last night that the weather in various sections of the Eastern Front is improving, and the positions defended by the German army are becoming increasingly consolidated.</p>
<p>Istanbul, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency: According to information from semi-official sources in Moscow this morning, due to the recent victories of the German army, the Soviet army's defenses against the German counteroffensive and the Soviet army's supply lines must be redeployed. Moscow admitted that the Soviet army in the Donets area failed to curb the vanguard of the German tank formation yesterday, and the German army has broken through the positions occupied by the Soviet army in early February. The German army in Kramatorskaya has also achieved partial victories. The Soviet army is now preparing for the second phase of the offensive.</p>
<p>Tank Battle Still Ongoing in the Donets River Basin</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, February 2nd, Havas News Agency: Yesterday, German and Soviet troops continued to engage in fierce fighting in the Donets River Basin. The German army advanced near the city of Kramatorskaya. Soviet officials have not frankly stated the positions held by the Red Army in the warzone. However, according to German sources, it has been confirmed that the German army has occupied the two cities of Kramatorskaya and Roso伏亞, and a large Red Army unit has been isolated and helpless. They are currently setting up positions around the city of Barvenkovo for a final struggle. According to reports from British visitors to Moscow, "When Nazi Germany decided to mobilize a large number of troops to fight on this narrow front, the Red Army could not stop its advance. Therefore, it is normal for the German army to gain a foothold. New German troops are still being sent to the Kramatorskaya area for reinforcements. The two sides have fought over several locations, and control has changed hands several times. They are still fighting hard." The Red Army General Headquarters also issued a war report stating that a large-scale tank battle had taken place in the Donets River Basin and is still ongoing. According to German sources, the armored formation under the command of the famous Soviet General Popov suffered heavy losses, which is enough to constitute a source of weakness for the Red Army. Semi-official sources in Moscow said that the Red Army's offensive has slowed down. There are three main factors for this: (1) the German army's resolute resistance, (2) the melting of ice and snow on the ground, and (3) the need to consolidate recently gained positions. Therefore, the nature of the war in the Donets River Basin and the Kharkov area has changed. In the past, both sides concentrated large numbers of infantry troops to fight and used tanks to charge. But at this time, it has been changed to guerrilla warfare. Soviet engineers are repairing transportation lines in the rear. It is very difficult to check this work. Before the German army withdrew, they burned them all, destroying them almost entirely. In addition, the recent melting of snow has filled the trenches with rainwater. This is the general situation on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Timoshenko Commands Military in Northwest Theater</p>
<p>As for the war situation in each region, they are described as follows: (1) There are no important events to report in the Caucasus. (2) In the Taganrog area, the Red Army launched a large-scale offensive on an eight-mile front near the Mius River. No fewer than several divisions of the Red Army participated in this battle. (3) Donets River, the Soviet side admits that the German army has adopted a certain strategy that puts the Red Army in the Kramadorska area at risk of being surrounded. The Red Army advancing along the Kharkov-谷諾托普 line seems to have been completely bogged down and unable to make progress. (4) There are no major changes in the Kursk area, but the troops under the command of General Golikov, starting from the city of Kursk and advancing along the railway, have already passed Orel. (5) Lake Ilmen area, the Soviet side declared that the Red Army has achieved major achievements, recovering the city of Temiask and two other cities. According to a message broadcast by Moscow Radio Station, the defeated soldiers belonged to the 16th German Army Corps, commanded by General Busch. The Red Army that won the victory belonged to the troops of General Timoshenko. The Red Army war report has not mentioned General Timoshenko for a long time, but his name has appeared again in this war report. This victory of the Red Army is of great significance, because the protruding part of the German army in the Seliger Lake area has always been a threat to the Moscow-Leningrad railway. This victory of the Red Army has eliminated this threat. However, from now on, there will only be local nature, not likely to develop into a large-scale offensive. South of Lake Ladoga, the Red Army attacked the German positions no less than seventeen times, but all were repelled by the German army and suffered heavy losses. (6) The Finnish front is quiet.</p>
<p>Helsinki, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency: When the Moscow Radio Station reported on the war situation in the Lake Ilmen area yesterday, it stated that the Northwest Theater is now under the command of Marshal Timoshenko. When he took office in this position was not disclosed.</p>
<p>Lisbon, February 2nd, Central News Agency: According to a telegram from Moscow, the Soviet Information Bureau issued a special announcement on the night of the 1st, stating that the Soviet troops under the command of Marshal Timoshenko have launched a new operation in the area between Moscow and Leningrad.</p>
<h3>Advisor Ishiwata Delivers Speech Strengthening the National Government Economic Committee</h3>
<p>Tokyo, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Director Sato of the Japanese Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau mentioned in the Diet on the 1st that three giants of the Chinese financial world, Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shumin, and Wu Zhenxiu, have taken office as members of the National Government Economic Committee, expressing a positive attitude of cooperation. All parties have expressed great favor to this. According to Mr. Ishiwata Sotaro, economic advisor to the National Government, who is currently in Japan for official business, the three gentlemen are all giants in the Chinese financial world. Mr. Zhou Zuomin is currently the General Manager of Jin City Bank and is an authority in the financial world. His qualifications and experience have always been respected by people in the financial world. Mr. Zhou is full of talent and is particularly proactive in handling affairs, and he is fluent in Japanese. He is an old friend of mine for many years. I met with him in Nanjing. He has devoted himself to developing cotton production in North China and has achieved remarkable results. Now that he has taken office as a member of the National Economic Committee, his full activity in the future is worth looking forward to. Mr. Tang Shoumin has served in the financial world since returning to China after studying in the United States. He has served as the General Manager of the Bank of Communications and is a giant in the Shanghai banking world. His reputation has always been well-respected. It can be said that the National Government has gained a talented person with his cooperation to establish the financial world in the future. Mr. Wu Zhenxiu is a graduate of Keio University in Japan, is exceptionally fluent in Japanese, and has a deep understanding of all aspects. He is currently the General Manager of the Bank of China and is very skillful. When the National Economic Committee held a conference in Beijing a few days ago, Mr. Wu attended despite his illness, and Chairman Wang was deeply moved. In short, the three gentlemen are the great pillars of the Chinese financial world. Their active cooperation with the National Government this time shows that the connection between the National Government and the financial world has become closer. At the same time, the negative people of the past will also join the National Government camp one after another and work hard for the construction of the new China.</p>
<h3>Minister Saltazawa Flies to Beijing from Ping</h3>
<p>Beijing, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Japanese Minister to Beijing Saltazawa flew to Nanjing at 9:40 a.m. on the 1st to discuss issues such as the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Shigemitsu Returns to the Capital</h3>
<p>Nanjing, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu, after going to Beijing on the 24th of last month, met with Chairman Zhu of the North China Political Affairs Committee, Supreme Commander Okamura of the Japanese North China Dispatch Army, and Minister Saltazawa, and held various important agreements.

<h3>North China Reserve Bank Opens</h3>
<p>Beijing, February 2nd, Central News Agency: The Beijing Head Office and Tianjin Branch of the North China Reserve Bank officially opened on the 1st. On the first day of business, depositors were very enthusiastic. The Beijing Head Office had more than 200 depositors on the first day, totaling more than 1.08 million yuan.

<h3>Wang Jinzai Writes to Li Zongren</h3>
<p>Hankou, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Since being captured by the Japanese army on the 25th of last month, Wang Jinzai wrote to Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth War Zone of Chongqing, on the 1st, saying that "During this war of resistance, I have worked hard, but I have been subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army, and my subordinates have suffered heavy casualties, which is very painful. At 4:00 p.m. on February 25th, when I led a team of 23 people to retreat, I was pursued by the Japanese army again. I was captured because of a foot injury. The Japanese army is now treating me exceptionally well, so I have decided to participate in the peace movement after my injury heals and strive for the common "welfare" of the East Asian nations."</p>
<p>Hankou, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Mr. Honma, a member of the Press Department of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army, accompanied the army this time to participate in the spring operation to attack the troops of Wang Jinzai, who was loyal to Chongqing. According to the situation in the Jianli area of Hubei Province, the main point is that this operation wiped out the troops of Wang Jinzai, loyal to Chongqing, but in order to ensure the triangle area of Hubei Province, the work of appeasing the local residents at the same time as the Japanese army's offensive was particularly successful. For example, many residents in the Jianli area prepared Japanese national flags when they learned that the Japanese army would attack. According to prisoners of war and residents, Wang Jinzai's army was just a bandit, and they were always looking forward to the National Government army and the Japanese army coming to rescue them. They had heard from people from Hankou that the Japanese army absolutely protected the safety of ordinary people, while Wang Jinzai's army often forced young men in the Jianli area to serve, so parents often ordered their sons to flee to other places to wait for the arrival of the National Government army and the Japanese army. The residents of the area are very simple and honest. There are many who have never seen a car in their lives. In addition, since the Hubei Provincial Security Team entered Jianli, it has gained the trust of the residents due to its strict military discipline, so the market has become quiet, especially after it was first occupied. Local agricultural products such as cotton and miscellaneous grains are stored in large quantities. At that time, Wang Jinzai was planning to forcibly purchase them, but because of the rapid offensive of the Japanese army, he did not get his wish. In addition to a group of cadres, the rest of Wang Jinzai's army were all farmers who have now been disarmed and returned to their hometowns. These simple-minded residents will be able to live and work in peace under the rule of the National Government in the future. In this way, agricultural products in the area can also be greatly increased, and the food problem in Wuhan can be adequately supplied.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Political Affairs Office Established Within Days</h3>
<p>Suzhou, February 2nd, Central News Agency: The Suzhou Provincial Government has been ordered to establish a Political Affairs Office, with Mr. Huang Jingqi, specially appointed by the Central Government, as the Director of the Political Affairs Office.

The official date of establishment of the Political Affairs Office is expected to be within ten days.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Opens Military Conference Discussing Accelerated Fortifications in the Southwest Japanese Army Attacks Communist Army in Guidetang</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: According to information received here in Chongqing today, due to the expansion of Japanese military operations in Yunnan Province and the success of the Japanese army in southern Hubei Province, Chongqing has had to accelerate fortifications in southwestern China. It is reported that several military conferences have been held. General Bai Chongxi flew from Chongqing to Guilin by plane on February 21st to discuss with military leaders there on preventing the Japanese army from threatening the southwest.</p>
<p>Kaifeng, February 2nd, Central News Agency: The Japanese army's various units launched a fierce attack on the Communist army's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Education Team of about 3,000 people north of Guidetang on the Longhai Line at dawn on the 27th of last month. On the 28th, they surrounded them in Huzhuang, Fuji, and Gaoti, and gave them a thorough blow, and completely wiped out their nest. In this battle, 823 Communist army corpses were left behind, and 270 people were captured. The Japanese army also intercepted one mortar, twelve light machine guns, three grenade launchers, and 318 rifles, and occupied its factories and food warehouses.</p>
<h3>North China Political Affairs Committee Changes Governors of Hebei and Henan Provinces</h3>

<h3>Large-Scale War to Be Launched in the Mares Area of Tunisia</h3>
<p>Headquarters of the German Leader, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency – German military reports stated that in Tunisia, German aircraft assisted in the Axis forces' offensive, achieving further progress yesterday. Enemy transport facilities and ships anchored in the port of Bone were attacked by air and suffered heavy losses. German aircraft and anti-aircraft guns shot down eleven enemy aircraft in the Mediterranean area.</p>
<p>Rome, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency – The Italian military headquarters announced today that thirteen enemy aircraft were destroyed on the Tunisian front, seven of which were shot down in aerial combat, and the remaining five were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. There were local battles in Tunisia yesterday, with our side holding the advantage.</p>
<p>Lisbon, February 2nd, Central News Agency – According to news from the North African front, on the 28th, the Axis forces launched a full-scale offensive on a vast front of 50 kilometers, starting from Cape Serrat, about 35 kilometers west of Bizerte in northeastern Tunisia, passing through Medjez el Bab, to Bou Arada. The fiercest fighting was in the area of Banjia, 40 kilometers west of Tunis. German forces deployed new tanks and infantry to concentrate attacks on the anti-Axis positions, and have now approached a point 15 kilometers east of the area. Anti-Axis front news also widely reports the crisis in Banjia, stating that if the anti-Axis forces cannot stop the Axis advance, and the Axis forces advance to Medjez el Bab, the anti-Axis forces' retreat will be cut off. Also, after the Rommel forces advanced once in the central region of Tunisia, they turned to another location, using clever tactics to lure the anti-Axis forces from Kasserine to the minefields of Fériana, 28 kilometers south of the area, and continued to advance north of Sbeitla, completely foiling the enemy's attempt to advance eastward.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, February 1st, Havas Agency – According to news from both the Axis and Anglo-American sides, the fighting on the Tunisian front was not very active yesterday. Rome issued a military report stating that only local battles occurred on the Tunisian front, with the Axis forces gradually gaining the upper hand, and mutual artillery bombardments in some war zones. A destroyer was sunk off the coast of Algeria by Italian aircraft. The German military report also stated that the German Air Force bombed Allied lines of communication and Algerian shipping. The Allied Headquarters in North Africa stated that American forces recaptured the city of Fériana on the Gafsa railway, south of Kasserine, and the position of American forces in the Sidi Nsir area has also improved. Furthermore, according to the military report issued by the French separatist headquarters, "Artillery battles and activities of scouting units continue in the central sector." "Nothing noteworthy on the southern sector." In addition, both sides are preparing to launch a large-scale war in the Mares area at the southern tip of Tunisia. General Eisenhower's headquarters has moved to the foothills of the Ksour Mountains, so observers generally believe that General Eisenhower does not want to break through the railway from Métouia to Gabès, but will attempt to bypass the Mares defense line and enter the Matmata area, directly approaching Tala. However, this move by the American forces will still encounter strong resistance from the fortified positions from Gabès to Chotts.</p>
<p>Berlin, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency – British newspapers and magazines have stated that the sole purpose of the Allied military operations in North Africa is to contain the Axis forces, but the recent developments in the Tunisian war situation have proven otherwise. The original purpose of the Allies was to quickly complete the occupation of Tunisia, eliminate the Axis forces, and then seize control of the Mediterranean sea route, which could then be used to advance into Europe. We still remember that at the beginning of November 1942, when the Allies landed in Morocco and Algiers, there were no German or Italian soldiers in Tunisia. Later, German and Italian troops crossed the sea to Bizerte and Tunis, and the Allied advance was immediately stalled. Anglo-American troops repeatedly launched large-scale attacks on Tunisia, but ultimately failed to succeed. The Allies in North Africa originally wanted to contain the Axis forces, but now they have not only failed to achieve their goal, but have instead been severely beaten by the Axis forces and are in a state of complete helplessness.</p>
<p>The Rome Talks Fully Noted the Movements of Neutral Countries; Italy Strengthened Economic Cooperation with Germany</p>
<p>Rome, February 2nd, Central News Agency – After German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived in Rome on the 24th, he held four talks with Prime Minister Mussolini from the 25th onwards. According to sources, the content of the talks was as follows: (1) The anti-Axis countries have recently spread various rumors, but the German and Italian governments have decided not to recognize them. The just demands of the Axis powers will not be discussed in peace talks. (2) The overall industrial mobilization in Italy is not yet practical. Economic cooperation with the German government must be strengthened. This economic cooperation plan was reviewed at the talks. (3) To counter the threat of communism, the German and Italian governments must ensure the cooperation of their forces with other countries. In order to achieve the above objectives, the Italian government needs to clear up past outstanding issues. It is expected that the representatives of the two countries will carefully discuss this matter. (4) At the current stage of the war, full attention should be paid to the movements of neutral countries. The German and Italian governments must adopt a consistent attitude. The German and Italian governments, in view of the Anglo-American machinations against the Balkan countries, must express an attitude of understanding. The two countries have carefully exchanged views.</p>
<p>Rome, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency – Political figures here stated that the four-day talks between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop were the Axis powers' response to the Casablanca Conference, and also demonstrated the Axis side's iron determination to strive for final victory. It is noteworthy that military representatives from Germany and Italy participated in the talks. Italian newspapers, when commenting on the authorities' public statement, specifically pointed out two points: First, the Axis powers are determined not to allow the Bolsheviks to ravage Europe. Second, the Axis powers reiterated their commitment to establishing a new European order to protect Europe.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister's Visit to Italy</p>
<p>Rome, February 2nd, Central News Agency – The Italian government issued a statement on the afternoon of the 1st, stating that "Foreign Minister Ribbentrop of Germany visited Rome on February 24th on behalf of Führer Hitler. When Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived in Rome, Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini, Cabinet Secretary-General Rosini, representatives from the party, government, and military, as well as German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen, and German Embassy staff, all went to welcome him. The Foreign Minister was accompanied by German Foreign Ministry Ambassador Ritter, Deputy Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Warlimont, and German Foreign Ministry experts. Italian Ambassador to Germany Alfieri also accompanied him. The next day, the German Foreign Minister visited Prime Minister Mussolini at his official residence and personally handed him a letter from Führer Hitler. A meeting was then held, lasting a total of four hours, with Italian Ambassador Alfieri in attendance. Subsequent talks were held continuously for several days, reviewing all European issues and Axis operations. Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini held a long talk with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. At one of the meetings, Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini, Italian Chief of Staff Averoldi, and German Deputy Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Warlimont were present. The meeting proceeded very smoothly, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. The result was complete agreement that Germany and Italy should continue to fight together with the full support of Japan and other allies, and strive for final victory. Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop reaffirmed the determination of Germany and Italy to devote all necessary national power to the war until the enemy is annihilated, to eliminate the danger of Bolshevism on the eastern border of Europe, and reiterated the determination of Germany and Italy, after achieving final victory, to help the people of all European countries based on justice, to liberate them from financial power and Jewish exploitation, and to promote the protection of the rights of all nations within the secure confines of a Greater Europe, so as to build a new order that guarantees the survival of the people of all European countries. After completing his mission, the German Foreign Minister returned to his country on the 28th with his staff."</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Seamen's Training School to Open in Mid-Month</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, February 2nd, Central News Agency – The Governor-General of the occupied territory of Hong Kong, in order to train nautical professionals and develop the shipping industry, has established the Hong Kong Seamen's Training School, and it is scheduled to officially open on the 15th of this month. The school's navigation and mechanical engineering departments originally planned to recruit 15 Chinese students, but the number of Chinese high school graduates around the age of 20 who applied for the exam was very high. After strict screening, it was decided to expand each department to 20 students. The duration of study for these students is set at three months. If their performance is excellent, the program will continue to be offered in the future to train a large number of Chinese nautical personnel.</p>
<h3>France Returns Concessions in China</h3>
<p>— Glimpses of Japanese Public Opinion</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>The French government has announced the return of concessions in China and the abolition of extraterritoriality. Japan signed a Sino-Japanese agreement with the same content with the National Government on January 9, and its ally Italy followed suit on January 14. However, the concessions that the French government decided to give up this time, such as the French Concession in Shanghai, took nearly a hundred years to create and had the significance of a quasi-colony. France had made considerable sacrifices. On January 11, the UK and the US abolished extraterritoriality and returned concessions in China in order to ingratiate themselves with Chongqing. Of course, this cannot be compared. The reason being, France, in fact, has so-called concession areas within the territory of the Republic of China, and maintains the so-called extraterritorial rights over people. On the other hand, the UK and the US have virtually eliminated them in reality, and although they claim to give them up, it is of little practical significance.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Shanghai French Concession is based on formal treaties and has a legal basis. After years of hard work, there is a complete organization under the Consul General, including administration, judiciary, police, health, fire protection, education, etc., and there is also the stationing of regular French troops, so it is not much different from a purely French colony. The abandonment of this important area and the extraterritoriality that has existed for a hundred years cannot but be said to be a show of goodwill from France towards the new China with the National Government as its center. Furthermore, the fact that the French Ambassador to Beijing, Cosme, held talks with Foreign Minister Chu Minyi of the National Government in Shanghai a few days ago is also noteworthy.</p>
<p>This wise move is due to the discernment of French leader Laval, who has taken a coordinated attitude towards Japan. After the recovery of the concessions and the restoration of legal rights, it is hoped that the achievements in administration and justice will surpass those under the rule of foreign officials in the past, and that the significance of sweeping away the old international affairs of a century will be clearly demonstrated to China and foreign countries. Moreover, this measure by the Vichy government can be said to be a reward for Japan's years of efforts to stabilize East Asia. China, Japan, and France cooperate with each other to establish eternal peace in East Asia. (Xiang: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun editorial on February 24)</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>On the 23rd, the French government notified the Chinese National Government of its decision to return the Beijing Embassy District and the concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Gulangyu, and other concessions and public concessions. When the National Government participated in the war, the Japanese government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration, returned the concessions and abolished extraterritoriality, solemnly expressing respect for Chinese sovereignty. The allied Italian government continued to respond. The Chinese people believed that only France had not yet abolished the unequal concessions and extraterritoriality. However, the wise French authorities also resolutely returned the concessions and abolished extraterritoriality, allowing China to escape the shackles of a century and restore the reputation of a complete and independent country.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Laval cabinet, France has abandoned its former illusions and worked with Germany to seek national regeneration. Leader Laval has held firm to this fundamental policy, breaking through all domestic difficulties and urging the people to move towards this bright path. Last autumn, the United Kingdom and the United States illegally invaded French North Africa and openly declared war on France, and France's policy of assisting the Axis powers also reached a decisive stage at this time. France's policy of assisting the Axis powers is not only to cooperate with Germany and Italy in Europe to strive for victory, but also to extend the policy of assisting the Axis powers to East Asia. After the publication of the Japan-Vietnam Joint Declaration, the relationship of friendship was enhanced, and then an economic agreement was established. When the Japanese army advanced into Guangzhou Bay this time, the French government and the authorities in Vietnam showed goodwill and cooperation, which in fact proved the close relationship between the two sides. The French government not only assists Japan, but also wishes to assist the National Government, which is on the same front with Japan and advancing towards the conquest of the United Kingdom and the United States, and resolutely announced the return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, hoping to enhance Sino-French friendly relations. Although the French government has not officially recognized the National Government, this measure is of great significance. The National Government is certainly grateful for France's kindness, and Japan, which is in the position of an ally, also expresses its utmost gratitude.</p>
<p>After China's sovereignty is fully restored, the foundation of the National Government will become more solid, and politics will inevitably be strengthened. Chairman Wang can also take this opportunity to fulfill his century-old wish. After independence, autonomy, and political power are grasped, he will be able to thoroughly promote various wartime measures and make every Chinese person aware of the mission of "the nation at war." Is not the recovery of concessions and the abolition of unequal treaties the only slogan of Chongqing's resistance and national construction? However, Chongqing has only obtained empty promises from the UK and the US without any practical value, and still willingly degenerates into treason, while the National Government has obtained the support of Japan, Italy, and France, solving the century-old shackles in one fell swoop and completely restoring the country's autonomy. From now on, Chongqing's reason for resistance will be eliminated, and the hearts of the Chinese people will inevitably lean towards the National Government.

<h3>Communist Movement to Be Completely Eliminated; Director Sato of the Military Affairs Bureau Responds to Questions from Members</h3>
<p>Tokyo, February 2nd, Central News Agency – Director Sato of the Japanese Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau, when answering questions from Congressman Kakeo in the House of Representatives' Special Committee on Wartime Criminal Matters this morning, explained the countermeasures against the communist movement in China and the South, stating in brief: Although the actual strength of the Chinese Communist Army is not accurately known at present, it is roughly no more than 500,000 to 600,000. The Communist Army must not only be defeated, but in fact, its cell structure must be thoroughly destroyed. In particular, regarding the question of how to eliminate the forces they have established in North China over the years, research has led to considerable conclusions. Our side has been working hard to destroy its fundamental organization for two years, and has achieved great results. Regarding the ideological war against the Communist Party's army, it should be the responsibility of the National Government in China. Moreover, Chairman Wang has raised the banner of anti-communism and is practicing the elimination of communism. Following the shift in Japan's China policy, the political and military strength of the National Government is becoming stronger and stronger, and public movements are becoming more and more active. The results are worth anticipating. There are also potential activities of the Communist Party in various parts of the South, but there are adequate preparations for ideological work and security work in the South. If the spirit of Japan's "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof" is promoted and given full play, then these areas will not be easily exploited by the Communist Party. Therefore, we must make our greatest efforts in the future. Furthermore, Japan's diplomacy and anti-communism within our country and sphere of influence should be separate issues.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Authorities in Java Issue Statement; Clarifying Future Intentions</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 2nd (Central News Agency) - It has been one year since Japanese forces landed in Java on March 1st of last year. At that time, the Japanese commander issued Proclamation No. 1 on March 7th, when the flames of war had not yet completely subsided, and began to implement a strong and peaceful military administration. Recently, the military authorities issued a statement, reviewing the facilities of the past year and clarifying their future intentions. The gist is recorded as follows: The Japanese army's invasion of Java was aimed at liberating and rescuing the local indigenous people, because they had been subjected to long-term exploitation by the former Dutch East Indies authorities in terms of economy, and their lives had long been in distress. After the Japanese army occupied Java, it immediately transported a large number of cheap daily necessities from Japan to provide relief and alleviate the people's difficulties. The indigenous people were deeply grateful for the Japanese side's kindness. Java has various specialized technical talents, abundant labor, and the output of raw materials for heavy industry is also beyond our expectations. Therefore, Java is a good source of resources, and its future development is deeply anticipated. Regarding military administrative agencies, the central agencies have a central headquarters, divided into eight departments: General Affairs, Internal Affairs, Justice, Police Affairs, Finance, Industry, Transportation, and Propaganda. In addition, there are also the Enemy Property Management Department, land transportation and communication enemy property management parks, private territory management public corporations, local electric power business public corporations, etc. As for local administrative agencies, they are divided into seventeen state halls, two Marquis territory affairs bureaus, and the special city of Jakarta. The English Marquis territories will retain the titles of their respective Marquis, but will implement administration adapted to the new era under the guidance of the Marquis Territory Affairs Bureau. As for the policy of dealing with the residents, Dutch people who have been mobilized by the enemy army are treated as prisoners of war, excluding those of mixed blood. Only tens of thousands of Dutch people of purely Dutch descent are dealt with. This was the biggest problem at the beginning of the implementation of military administration. For foreigners other than Dutch and indigenous people, a residency registration system is implemented. Those who have obvious hostile behavior will be detained. There are a total of 900,000 overseas Chinese here. Those overseas Chinese who had obvious anti-Japanese hostility before the war were resolutely arrested and their property confiscated. By December of last year, this measure had come to an end. In the future, the authorities will protect overseas Chinese who cooperate in construction. Since July of last year, overseas Chinese elementary schools have been allowed to resume classes, and two overseas Chinese newspapers have also been allowed to operate. As for the indigenous people, the Native Purchase System Investigation Committee was organized in November of last year to advise on education, hygiene, and literacy, and to bear the important task of conveying public opinion. The public security of the whole island is also extremely good. The British and American sides may engage in propaganda after defeat, but the Japanese side has taken preemptive measures, implemented thorough prevention plans, and started training for active air defense. As for the overview of the implementation of military administration, it can be summarized into the following four points: (1) Education: The authorities attach great importance to it. The main policy is to establish a primary education system, eliminate illiteracy, popularize Japanese, and train teachers. Currently, there are 13,000 schools on the island with approximately 1.8 million students. (2) Hygiene: The authorities will use Javanese-produced quinine to eradicate tropical malaria and have announced the establishment of a medical university in Jakarta. (3) Finance, currency and finance: Before the landing operation, the enemy often made counter-propaganda against the Japanese military notes (currency). However, since the Japanese army occupied Java, the circulation of military notes has been very smooth, and the general public trusts them more than the old currency. The compilation of the outline of the military administration accounting insists on the policy of making military point expenditures for necessary funds, while also taking into account the balance of the entire expenditure, so the financial situation has always remained sound. Regarding prices, the issuance of military notes has been carefully studied and appropriate countermeasures have been taken, so there is no phenomenon of soaring prices. As for financial institutions, Zhengjin, Taiwan, Mitsui, and Huanan banks have been allowed to operate. Other rural banks, rural rice banks, and state-run pawnshops, which have a significant relationship with the daily lives of the indigenous people, have also been allowed to operate to ensure the stability of the people's livelihood. The Southern Development Bank also started business in July of last year, undertaking the important task of guiding the financial world. (4) Industry and economy: The authorities' future industrial policy is to fully exploit Java's new mission as a supply base for operations. The Military Administration Supervisory Department has appointed a sugar industry management affairs committee, reorganized the old organization, and established the Java Sugar Industry Federation and the Java Sugar Sales Federation to enable Taiwan Sugar, Meiji Sugar, Shioshui Port Sugar, Nanyo Xingfa Okinawa Sugar and other companies to participate in cooperation, specifying production quantities and making efforts to increase production. In short, the various measures of the various departments of the Javanese military administration and the progress of various enterprises in Java are not shifted by the interests of Java alone, but are aimed at completing the Greater East Asia War, establishing a decisive battle system, and becoming one of the main links in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. What we must not forget now is to earnestly arouse the need to save ships and save consumption. We now have a considerable amount of daily necessities that are transported from Japan at the risk of sea transport. This spirit is greatly appreciated by the residents of Java.</p>
<h3>Respect for the Sovereignty of the National Government; Japan Reaffirms Policy</h3>
<p>At the meeting of the North China Development Company Committee of the House of Representatives on the afternoon of February 24th, Chairman Teshhiroki asked the government about its policy towards China:</p>
<p>(1) The basic policy taken by the Japanese government towards China is to strengthen the political power of the National Government and to move forward in mutual cooperation between Japan and China to complete the Greater East Asia War. In terms of implementation, what attitude will the government take towards China? I hope to explain this point.</p>
<p>(2) Secondly, measures such as the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights will naturally have a considerable impact on the economic activities of state-owned companies such as the North China Development Company and the China Central Revitalization Company, as well as the general Japanese in China. What is the government's policy on this? Please explain so that those concerned can know what to do.</p>
<p>Regarding the basics of Japan's policy towards China, Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia replied. Regarding the Greater East Asia War's relation to China, the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry, Sato, will explain. A summary of the main points is recorded below:</p>
<p>Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia: Japan's fundamental policy towards China is to respect China's freedom and independence and to exert the political power of the National Government. This has been repeatedly explained in this committee and other meetings. The National Government, by participating in this war, lives and dies with Japan, cooperates with each other, and is determined to stand up and destroy the Anglo-American war. Japan and China maintain close cooperation in politics, military affairs, and economy, and move forward to complete the Greater East Asia War. The relationship between the two countries will of course be closer in the future. Because this is cooperation between two independent countries, we strictly adhere to respecting each other's position. The National Government is fully exerting itself automatically in various political affairs in order to express its cooperation with the Japanese side, and Japan does not interfere with its administration.</p>
<p>For example, the issue of the national flag is entirely the automatic exertion of the sovereignty of the National Government and has nothing to do with Japan. At the same time, Japan's adoption of measures such as returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights is to respect China's sovereignty and is entirely based on Japan's automatic consideration.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of the impact of the measures taken by Japan on the Japanese in China, Japan's attitude towards China hopes to realize true Japanese-Chinese cooperation. Therefore, the economic development of the Japanese should abandon the concept of rights and privileges held by the British and Americans. In the future, the related businesses of the North China Development Company and the China Central Revitalization Company will also cooperate with the revitalization of Chinese industry and will need to be appropriately adjusted. As for the activities of the general Japanese, some impact is unavoidable, but there will be no impact on activities based on the spirit of true Japanese-Chinese cooperation.</p>
<p>In this way, the foundation for true Japanese-Chinese cooperation, coexistence, and co-prosperity can be established. Only by standing on this new foundation can the permanent and leaping development of the Japanese be ensured. Japanese people who are engaged in business in China are eager to fully understand the meaning of national policy and cooperate with pleasure.</p>
<p>Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Sato: I agree with the interpretation of the Minister of Greater East Asia just now. Now I will add some points from the perspective of war guidance. The policy taken by Japan towards China, from the point of view of war, is to eliminate the basis for the anti-Japanese war in Chongqing. The guiding spirit of Sun Yat-sen's revolution was to abolish unequal treaties and liberate China from its colonial status: in other words, the guiding spirit of the modern Chinese national movement is to seek China's departure from colonial status and ensure complete independence. If China uses its own strength for this great cause, it is questionable whether it can succeed even after a long period of time and with extraordinary sacrifices. However, because of the change in Japan's policy towards China, this great cause was easily completed. This move will produce great changes in the history of China, Japan, and even East Asia. However, the reason for the realization of this move is due to the efforts and achievements of Chairman Wang since the return of the National Government to Nanjing, and Japan's deep reliance on and cooperation with it.</p>
<p>Moreover, not only has the anti-Japanese war in Chongqing lost its basis, but the United States has also lost most of its war objectives. Since the China Incident, the United States has often obstructed Japan, and Japan's actions in China have been arbitrarily dominated by infringements on sovereignty and territory, and economic monopolies.</p>
<p>Now that Japan has taken this policy, it can no longer be said to be an infringement on sovereignty and territory. The restoration of China's complete independence, which the Chinese people have been eagerly demanding since Sun Yat-sen's revolution, has been realized with Japan's cooperation. What does the United States think about this? Also, the term economic cooperation is often arbitrarily considered by the United States as Japan's attempt to monopolize China. Now, not only have concessions and extraterritorial rights been returned, but Japan has also returned all of the enemy property rights obtained by bloodshed in the war to China. What does the American who arbitrarily dominates the economic behavior of monopolization have to say after seeing this? Of course, we do not need the United States to understand this now, but this change in Japan's policy has an extremely important impact on eliminating the anti-war excuse of the Chongqing and American sides.</p>
<p>Due to the change in policy, from the perspective of individuals between Chinese and Japanese personnel, or from the position of the company, perhaps some damage has been suffered. People in this position may oppose it because the national policy is of no help and instead hinders their own interests. However, thinking from the big picture, the government and the military will resolutely eliminate any obstacles in order to implement this policy. (Sho: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on February 25)</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Cooperation in Water Conservancy; Yellow River Management Plan Determined</h3>
<p>The Yellow River embankment upstream of Kaifeng was breached by Chiang Kai-shek's regular army in 1938 in order to clean up the post-fall situation in Kaifeng, resulting in flooding in the Huai River basin and even the vast area of the Yangtze River downstream. In addition, the downstream Yellow River basin at the breach point, namely northern Henan Province and Shandong Province, was cut off from water irrigation. As a result, vast Chinese villages were abandoned, resulting in the complete loss of agricultural products that annually produced 00 dan of cotton and 0.0 million tons of wheat. In order to improve this situation, Japan has been researching and investigating for several years, gradually reaching a plan and cooperating with the National Government to implement it. Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia replied to the question of Mr. Haraguchi Junin at the Committee of North China Development Company of the House of Representatives on the morning of the 23rd:</p>
<p>"The management of the Yellow River, as history shows, has been a major issue in China for thousands of years. Chiang Kai-shek not only did not repair it, but worsened it, so the Huai River basin became a vast ocean, while the old river became dry. It goes without saying that its relief is a major issue in terms of security and rural revitalization. The Asia East Institute has conducted detailed surveys and studies, and has obtained a preliminary plan for a concrete repair and water management policy. Now we will cooperate with the National Government to start this historic great cause. (Sho: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on February 24)</p>

<h3>General Price Situation in Shaanxi Province</h3>
<p>— Jin Yan</p>
<p>Prices Rise Steadily, Especially This Year; Inconsistent Authority of Control Agencies</p>
<p>The price issue in Shaanxi is the most valued thing in recent years. No matter what level of society, friends who meet, talk for a minute, most of them will be involved in this incident. In the past, it was the general public (consumers) who worried about rising prices, but now it is a small number of people (hoarders) who are afraid of falling prices. So you can hear the voices of research and manipulation of control everywhere, but in fact, prices have not fallen, and they have not fallen. Gai hoarders are afraid of falling, want to sell, and the general public is also afraid of falling, and dare not buy. Under this situation, the actual price is only temporarily stable.</p>
<p>For several years, prices in Shaanxi have been rising steadily, especially this year, which has made great progress and is very different. For example, native ground flour costs 5 yuan and 6 jiao per catty, and the official price of machine-made mixed flour is 193 yuan per bag, but in fact, it cannot be bought. The black market has risen to 260 to 70 yuan! Ordinary cloth needs more than 20 yuan per foot, Dumi sells for 90 yuan per city dou, limestone is 700 yuan per ton, and Chinese cabbage is 1 yuan and 45 jiao per catty. In particular, hawkers cut open Chinese cabbage for retail sales, which is an unprecedented phenomenon. Old people are surprised as a spectacle. To the ordinary haircut needs 12 yuan, so the clothing and food life of the general public have problems, thus arousing dissatisfaction from all parties. The reasons for the rise in prices in Shaanxi are: First, the source of goods has decreased, and the supply and demand are out of balance; second, many goods from various southeast regions. Shaanxi is the only import hub. Not only do Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, etc. have always been imported from Shaanxi, but also Sichuan merchants come here in large groups to buy goods. According to the survey, there are no less than 1,000 families with large capital and great background. Among them, in addition to a few who go east to Luoyang Jieshou to snap up, the rest are mostly bought in Xi'an, with refreshing prices and unlimited quantities. This matter is of great significance to the stimulation of prices in Shaanxi. Third, there are more banks in Xi'an than ever before. In addition to Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, as well as the old Jincheng, Shanghai, and Shaanxi Province commercial banks, there are also Chuan Kang, Chuan Salt, Yuhua, Yaxi Industrial, Xingwen, Siming, etc., with new ones being established every month, either buying land to build houses or renting houses to renovate. They have all opened one after another. In addition, there are branches or offices of banks in various provinces, totaling no less than dozens of them. Since there are many banks, it is inevitable that some of them are engaged in activities other than legal business. There are even those who assume the name of factory companies, buy up agricultural products in large quantities, saying "raw materials". In fact, some factories have not started construction, and some buy more with less, but wait for the price to sell, or simply and directly, only see buying in, not selling out. The stimulation of prices is the most important thing. When the wheat-producing area in Guanzhong harvested wheat this year, heavy rain caused disaster, and both quantity and quality were greatly reduced. After entering summer, there was a long period of drought, and the autumn harvest was thin. Therefore, there is a lack of food. On the one hand, the population of Shaanxi has increased sharply in recent years. No less than millions of people from Shanxi, Henan, and various southeastern provinces have come to Shaanxi and live in various counties. At present, along the Longhai Railway line, almost half of the pedestrians on the streets of various cities have accents from other provinces. All these new customers are either officials or small industrial and commercial vendors. It can be said that there are very few who farm the fields. Even if there are, the arable land has not increased. Therefore, there are few producers and many eaters, and there is a greater lack of food. In addition, the disaster situation in Henan Province is currently very serious. Refugees come to the west in an endless stream, and this province must also provide food for the military and civilians in Henan. A large amount of food is transported to the east, and the lack of food stimulates the rise in wages and prices. In the past, the authorities had not organized control of materials, but the authority was inconsistent, there were too many constraints, the design was not strict, and omissions were made, so it was not possible to achieve practical results in the end. The Shaanxi Provincial Government has recently formulated various regulations to stabilize prices, established inspection and flat-selling agencies. It is still unpredictable what effect will be achieved in suppressing and stabilizing prices.</p>

<h3>Tax on Foreign Liquor and Soda to be Included in Unified Tax, Collected at Factories</h3>
<p>The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, based on the principle that taxes on foreign liquor and soda have been included in the unified tax scope and should be collected at the factories as soon as possible, has specially formulated and promulgated the "Measures for Registering Foreign Liquor and Soda Manufacturers" and ordered its subordinate taxation bureaus to comply. It is reported that after receiving the order, the Jiangsu Provincial Taxation Bureau has issued a notice to the manufacturers concerned, requiring them to apply for registration with the Taxation Bureau on Jiujiang Road before March 31 of this year, so that it can be forwarded to the Taxation Department for verification and approval. Once the registration is approved, taxes will be paid in accordance with regulations.</p>

<p>Authorities Order Various Trade Associations to Register with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Adjusting Institutions, Re-electing Directors and Supervisors, Establishing Evaluation Committees, Distributing Goods</p>
<p>More than 200 trade associations in this city have been formally approved and established. Now, under the urging of the relevant authorities, those who have not joined the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce as members must promptly submit a request to the Chamber of Commerce for registration and record, and prepare a membership list. The list should clearly state: 1. Business name; 2. Representative name; 3. Gender; 4. Age; 5. Native place; 6. Education; 7. Experience; 8. Whether or not they have joined any party; 9. Business capital amount; 10. Organizational nature; 11. Whether or not they are registered; 12. Business address, etc. It is also reported that all trade associations are now under the leadership of the competent authorities, adjusting their institutions, re-electing directors and supervisors, revising their articles of association, and jointly agreeing on trade rules. All trade firms must conduct business in accordance with the regulations. At the same time, evaluation committees and goods distribution groups will be established separately. Any goods operated by the trade must be evaluated by the association's evaluation committee to determine standard prices and sold within the specified period. However, the spot goods required for the market will be distributed fairly by the association's distribution group. Furthermore, various industries are adapting to the current economic structure and are discussing better methods separately. Therefore, the organization of various industries has gradually become stronger.</p>
<p>Municipal Women's Association to Host Press Today</p>
<p>Commemoration of March 8th Women's Day</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Women's Association has been reorganized since the incident and is affiliated with the Social Movement Guidance Committee, sparing no effort in promoting various women's welfare undertakings. It has successively established women's literacy classes, Li Qun Women's Voluntary Tutoring School, etc. Since the reorganization of the Social Movement Committee, the association has been under the guidance of the Shanghai Office of the Social Welfare Department. According to Ms. Qu Zhonglun, the person in charge of the association, in order to actively expand the association's affairs and establish close contact with all sectors of the city, it is scheduled to host the city's press at Xinghualou on Fuzhou Road at 7:00 p.m. today. It is also heard that the association will hold an expanded commemoration ceremony on "March 8th Women's Day."</p>
<p>Fishmongers' Association Petitions Authorities to Expedite Production of Standard Weights and Measures</p>
<p>Regarding the weights and measures used by members, the Fishmongers' Association of this city yesterday sent separate letters to the authorities of the two concessions, urging them to expedite the production and issuance of standard weights and measures. The essential points of the original letters are excerpted as follows: The authorities have strictly controlled the vegetable markets and cracked down on inaccurate weights and measures, and the results have been remarkable since the implementation. However, the market scales used by general vendors are all purchased from the market, and they are also subject to crackdown during inspections, which is very painful. The association believes that it is urgent for the government to specially manufacture standard weights and measures and distribute them to vendors for application. The association is willing to lead its members to purchase them unanimously, and at the same time, strictly crack down on illegal weights and measures prepared by citizens themselves, so as to eliminate malpractices and maintain the business of vendors. The association is organized by fishmongers in all vegetable markets in the city, and will naturally adhere to the policies and adopt them for implementation.</p>
<p>First Category Income Tax for the 31st Year to be Collected This Month</p>
<p>The Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the provisions of Article 26 of the revised Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, stipulates that the tax payment period for the first category, A and B items, should be in accordance with the annual settlement period of each industry, and should be paid in one lump sum from March 1 to the end of May each year. All first category, A and B items, income tax for the 31st year should be collected from March 1 of the 32nd year in accordance with the provisions of the Detailed Rules for Implementation. The tax arrears before that should still be levied according to regulations until they are fully paid. However, the district bureaus should comply with the regulations for the first category income tax for the 31st year and start with individual account checking, and should not perfunctorily handle the matter. In addition to submitting a report to the Ministry of Finance for record, a special telegram was sent to the collection bureaus in each district to comply. It is reported that after receiving the telegram from the Shanghai District Collection Bureau, it yesterday issued a notice to all companies, firms, banks, and factories to truthfully declare the amount of income from profit-making businesses of the first category for the 31st year in accordance with the regulations from the 1st of this month, and to also supplementally declare the tax arrears before that for verification and handling.</p>
<p>French Water and Electricity Company to Issue Wage Loans Today</p>
<p>All workers of the French Water and Electricity Company requested the company to improve their treatment, increase wages and rice subsidies. It is reported that the company agreed to grant a long-term loan of twelve days' wages to each person, and decided to issue it first today (the 3rd). Workers in the lathe room and other 17 departments, the foremen should not exceed 141 yuan at most, and the workers should not exceed 135 yuan at most. Except for rice subsidies, those who have not worked for 20 days in February will not be given loans. As for the workers' request for rice subsidies, the original plan was to reply at the end of last month, but because various aspects have not yet been properly negotiated, the company has not yet made any statement. However, the labor side is anxious to solve the problem and has appealed to the Shanghai Social Welfare Bureau and the Shanghai Office of the Social Movement Committee.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Various Places in Nanyang, No. 5</p>
<p>A Record of the Vicissitudes of the East Indies (3) By Qiao Song</p>
<p>(B) Mineral Resources: Mineral products are an important resource second only to agriculture in the East Indies. The main buried substances are oil, coal, gold, silver, manganese, potassium iodide, iron, dicupric oxide, nickel, bauxite, hard petroleum, diamonds, sulfur, lead, zinc, chromium, mercury, hoe, antimony, lead, tungsten, etc.; the ones that have been mined now are oil, coal, gold, silver, manganese, potassium iodide, tin, hard petroleum, bauxite, diamonds, sulfur, etc., and the resources of oil and tin are especially famous in the world, and the mineral reserves of iron and nickel are also very rich, but they have not been developed on a large scale, because the mining law of the Dutch East Indies in the past did not allow people to freely mine. The output of the main minerals in the Dutch East Indies is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Output of main minerals (unit: metric tons):</p>
<p>The numbers are based on the "America-Britain Tracking and Greater East Asia Economy" by Dai Mei.</p>
<p>Petroleum is the largest mineral product in the East Indies, with reserves of about 3 billion barrels (Barrie), and its distribution is very wide. The oilfields that have been mined are Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Ceylon. The rest are waiting for future investigation and development, but the oil production in 1939 was 7,948,000 tons, ranking fifth in the world. (698,000 tons of crude oil were sold as fuel, and the remaining 7,250,000 tons were refined oil, 2 million tons of gasoline and 410,000 tons of aviation gasoline). This kind of oil in the East Indies has always been operated exclusively by the three major companies under the British, Dutch and American capital.</p>
<p>Tin is a necessary metal for military purposes. None of the world powers have enough production, and it is a product monopolized by the Nanyang area. The tin production in the East Indies ranks third in the world after Malaysia and Bolivia, with an annual output of about 30,000 tons. The main areas for tin production in the East Indies are Bangka Island, Belitung Island, and Singkep Island between Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula in the Bangka Strait between the two major islands of Sumatra and Borneo. In addition, the Riau Islands Karimun, and Sumatra Island also have famous tin mines, among which the tin mine on Bangka Island is directly operated by the government, and Belitung Island is operated by the Belitung Mining Company jointly funded by the government and the people.</p>
<p>The base of lead ore bauxite is centered on Bintan Island in the Riau Islands, and Batam Island, Karimun Island and Bangka Island in the south also have considerable good quality discoveries. In addition, Borneo and Java also have deposits, but they have not been developed in large quantities. In addition, the bauxite ore on Bintan Island was discovered by the Japanese, and its ore volume is about 40 million tons.</p>
<p>Other minerals such as nickel have abundant reserves in Sulawesi. The nickel mines near Lake Matani and Lake Dewazi on the island have a grade of more than 3.5%. Iron ore in Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Sulawesi, the Moluccas Islands are rumored to have reserves of about 1 billion tons that have not yet been developed. At present, gold, silver, manganese, diamonds, potassium iodide, sulfur, hard petroleum, etc. have been developed on a considerable scale. In general, abundant mineral deposits are still in an uninvestigated and undeveloped state.</p>
<p>(4) Intrusion of International Capital</p>
<p>Since the Netherlands obtained the ruling power of the East Indies, it has guided the enterprises of the East Indies for the prosperity of the Netherlands, using the labor of the natives to encourage the cultivation of agricultural products such as rubber trees, tea, coffee, sugar, palm oil trees, etc. that the world needs. The result of this vigorous encouragement of planting specific agricultural products has caused changes in the structure of the East Indies economy. One is the development of international trade, and the other is the international agreement on important commodities.</p>
<p>For example, in the rubber aspect with the most prosperous trade with Britain and the United States, international cartels have been formed like bamboo shoots after a rain, such as the international cartel of tea, the international cartel of sugar, and other international industry alliances, making the Dutch East Indies a member of this kind of cartel. However, in these international cartels, Britain and the United States, especially Britain, occupy a leading position, and Britain and the United States occupy a larger amount in the foreign investment amount in the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine that the Dutch East Indies is a profitable place for Britain and the United States, and everything in the Dutch East Indies is indirectly manipulated by Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Investment amount of various countries in the Dutch East Indies (unit: 1000 guilders):</p>
<p>Numbers (based on the same table above)</p>
<p>Let's look at the investment situation of various categories:</p>
<p>Students in Chengdu District Serve on the Roads Once Every Sunday</p>
<p>Direct Traffic, Correct Unhealthy Habits, End After Satisfaction with Exercises</p>
<p>The circumstances of Chengdu District schools selecting students to set out on various roads to assist patrol officers in directing traffic, and conducting exercises for the first time on the 28th of last month, have been briefly recorded in the newspaper. The reporter is now exploring and recording the details as follows:</p>
<p>Held Once Every Sunday</p>
<p>In order to promote students' traffic ethics and hygiene ideas, the Chengdu District Police Department specially selected students to try out exercises on various roads in the district. The date is scheduled for every Sunday, taking advantage of the weekly holidays, so as not to cause students to be absent from class.</p>
<p>Assist Traffic and Guide Hygiene</p>
<p>This movement has already started for the first time on Sunday of last week (that is, February 28). It is found that there are 80 primary and secondary schools in Chengdu District, and it is stipulated that each school selects 6 students, that is, one senior and five intermediate, to go to the Chengdu District Police Station for assembly, and send them to various roads in the jurisdiction to assist in directing traffic, and correct various habits of passers-by that hinder hygiene in a persuasive way.</p>
<p>Held Again on the 7th of This Month</p>
<p>The assembly time at the police station every Sunday is 8:15 a.m., and then they go to various roads in the district to carry out traffic direction and correct unhealthy habits, working for two hours, until 10:15 a.m., when the task is completed and they return. The above exercises will still be held on Sunday, the 7th of this month. The number of serving students will increase to more than 400. The exercises will be terminated after they are deemed satisfactory.</p>
<p>Beggar Shelter Submits to Grain Bureau, Requesting Approval to Purchase Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The beggar shelter in this city houses a large number of beggars, but at this time of high rice prices and expensive firewood, the livelihood of the beggars in the whole shelter is extremely serious. Therefore, the shelter specially submitted a petition to the Municipal Food Administration Bureau yesterday, requesting approval to purchase Shantou sugar and miscellaneous grains, etc., in order to maintain the lives of the beggars in the shelter. After receiving the petition, the Grain Bureau stated that the beggar shelter is in the International Settlement and should apply to the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>Wine Shop and Clock Shop on Kangti Road Collapsed Suddenly</p>
<p>At 8:50 last night, a brick wall between two adjacent households in the Yixing Wine Shop opened by Peng Xu, a Hunanese, at No. 112 Kangti Road in the French Concession, and the Heng Han Clock Shop set up by Tian Baozhi, a Yangzhou native, at No. 114 collapsed suddenly, with a loud noise. The owners and partners in the two shops fled in panic. Neighbors nearby heard the alarm and thought that a tragic accident had occurred due to the collapse of the wall in the shop, so they urgently reported to the Lujiawan Police Station by telephone and sent detectives to investigate. At the same time, the Fire Brigade also received the report and quickly sent an ambulance to the address. It was only then that they knew that no one was injured due to everyone's alertness and avoidance. However, although the number and value of the clocks and watches damaged in the Heng Han Clock Shop could not be estimated, the losses were very heavy. As for the wine and wine jars piled up in the Yixing Wine Shop, the damage was not small.</p>
<p>Christian Lecture Hosted by YMCA</p>
<p>In order to promote moral education, enlighten young people's understanding of life, and guide rational life, the Shanghai YMCA has specifically scheduled to hold a Christian lecture from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. from March 3rd to 5th. The topics for the 3rd are (1) Life needs guidance, (2) How did Christ guide people's lives, (3) How does he guide us today. The location is in the auditorium of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, and Rev. Zhu Xin-shen will be the speaker. There will be musicians playing famous songs each time. The association welcomes people from all walks of life to freely attend the lectures.</p>
<p>Commemorating "3-3" Friendship Day</p>
<p>Today is the 9th anniversary of the International Friendship Day, and it is also the 30th anniversary of Huang Jingwan, the initiator, serving the society. We will all respect the friendship motto of "propriety, righteousness, loyalty, and trustworthiness", work hard at our posts, review our shortcomings in friendship, and make a solemn spiritual commemoration. At the same time, we will automatically save and donate to help those in need. Mr. Huang expounded his feelings to reporters yesterday, saying briefly:</p>
<p>The Initiator Expounds His Feelings</p>
<p>"The times have given me many hardships, and I have experienced valuable lessons, which have given me a clear understanding of society and life. It tells me how cold society is, and how weak human feelings are. It instructs me to fight against the harsh environment, and indicates the path that should be taken. Only 'self-reliance' can lead to 'regeneration', and 'self-help' can lead to 'friendship'. As for Friendship Day, I gathered six friends from various provinces in Shanghai at the Chenggeng Village Industrial and Educational Group in West Shanghai at 3:00 p.m. on March 3rd in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, and held a tea party to promote friendship. It was decided that a gathering would be held on this day every year. Although there have been years of war and no peace in the world, it is still commemorated on this day. Various newspapers have responded, which has shown the perseverance and wishes of friendship. By promoting it widely, transforming prejudices, cultivating kinship, and jointly seeking the promotion of friendship and the common prosperity of the nation, we will surely create a survival that conforms to justice and fairness for mankind."</p>
<p>Friendship Day, Review the Old and Know the New, Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>Friendship is the greatest. The ancients attached the most importance to friendship, but today's people ignore it. We should still start with friends, recognize parents and brothers as friends of blood, so that there will be no tragedy of watching the wall, recognize husband and wife as friends of the family, so that there will be no tragedy of divorce, and recognize that all levels of society can be friends, so that there will be no riots of resentment and hatred. China has always been a country of etiquette and righteousness. I have specially excerpted the teachings of ancient sages in China and the West. To build a new order, we must review the old and know the new!</p>
<p>(1) Confucius said: There are three kinds of beneficial friends, and three kinds of detrimental friends, (2) Book of Songs: Look at those birds, they still seek the sound of friends... The gods listen to it, and it will eventually be harmonious and peaceful, (3) Analects: In friendship with friends, words must be trustworthy, (4) Zengzi: Gentlemen gather friends with literature, and assist benevolence with friends, (5) Lu Xi said: To become a good person, you must find good friends. If the yeast is sour, how can you get sweet wine? (6) Strategies of the Warring States: Those who make friends with wealth will end their friendship when the wealth is exhausted, and those who make friends with beauty will be betrayed when the beauty fades, (7) Rousseau said: A person who abandons friends for his own sake has no value in making friends. Be careful, (8) Ancient poems: "Friends of profit cannot be close, you must make friends with old adults, kindness has the atmosphere of orchids, and true nature is seen in times of need," (9) Zeng Guofan said: The first thing to choose friends is "to choose those with lofty ambitions," (10) Western proverb: A person without friends can only be considered half a person, (11) Byron said: Good friends do not forget to fulfill their obligations, (12) Book of Han: Life and death reveal friendship, poverty and wealth reveal the state of friendship, (13) Zhuangzi said: The world and I are born together, and all things and I are one (friendship extended to the world), (14) Avatamsaka Sutra: May all sentient beings obtain peace and happiness, without all diseases and suffering (friendship extended to all sentient beings), (15) Nagarjuna Bodhisattva's Treatise on Generating Bodhicitta: I should benefit and bring peace and happiness to the rest of the sentient world, and view all sentient beings in the ten directions as if they were my own body (this is the greatest friendship, it is the heart of a Bodhisattva),</p>
<p>Friendship Day Song, Jiang Qian</p>
<p>There is no greater clan in the world than friends, the word friend is shaped from two hands, helping each other in times of trouble, with a common pulse connecting left and right. One village and one country have limited people, but friendship can be extended to the universe; making friends with ancient sages who have lasted for thousands of years, facing each other with a book and being sincere, making friends with outstanding people in all directions, writing earnestly as if face to face; moreover, times are the same and places are the same, a hall of laughter is harmonious and harmonious. Learning from each other's strengths and advising on each other's weaknesses, helping each other with strength and sharing wealth; my parents know my friends, the friendship of Bao and Guan is rare. The teaching of friendship in Nishan spreads to all countries, walking with fate in all directions; old people are safe and young people are cared for by trusting friends, the sages are the masters of all ages. Guanyin has a thousand hands and a thousand eyes, protecting and taking care of everyone without bias; Confucius, Lao Tzu, Jesus, and Muhammad are interested in the Buddha's sea, this heart and this reason are not different. The Western Paradise has no suffering, the upper saints gather in a magnificent light; holding the Amitabha number with the same heart, from now on, we will follow each other without separation. Mr. Huang makes friends most sincerely, and this song is passed down as a poem of the common people.</p>
<p>Several Questions on Friends, Yale</p>
<p>——Written to commemorate the 3-3 Friendship Day——</p>
<p>Today is the ninth Friendship Day. In the past, life was stable, and this festival was quite lively. Now that life is difficult, everyone has little mood to hold gatherings and enjoy themselves. It is precisely because of the difficult times that we should not stick to formalities, but cherish the relationship between friends even more, and achieve the true meaning of friends.</p>
<p>If we summarize the writings of ancient and modern times on friends and friendship, it does not go beyond the great path of loyalty, forgiveness, faith, righteousness, benevolence, and love. Although it is old-fashioned, we cannot deviate too far from the goals of these great paths when it comes to the way of friends. We only need to make the narrow meanings in the old principles more broad and make those that do not conform to the world more conform to the world, and we can do our best.</p>
<p>I don't want to quote classics, let's talk about several questions about friends.</p>
<p>(1) Rather Be Lacking Than Indiscriminate</p>
<p>A person should have great tolerance. Anyone who is acquainted can be regarded as a friend, but because of the relationship of "those who are near Zhu are red, and those who are near Mo are black," there are differences in interests. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully select friends in terms of "quality," and it is better to "rather be lacking than indiscriminate." The ancients said: "It is no regret to have a confidant." The formation of a confidant is due to the harmony of purpose and temperament, and everyone should know that the psychology of confidant friends is the same. However, the so-called confidant friends generally have great differences in nature, and the difference in nature can determine the length of time. Probably, the confidants in wine and meat pursuits have few happy days, while the confidants who assist benevolence with friends are stronger over time. All friends who open their mouths to talk about confidants are just pleasing people. You should certainly have more confidant friends, but to make friends think that you are a confidant, the first thing you need is to treat friends with loyal and sincere principles. In this way, time will tell, and friends will naturally be convinced and welcomed by friends, and sincerely willing to make you a confidant friend. The so-called "those who gain the Dao will be helped more, and those who lose the Dao will be helped less." The key to gain and loss lies entirely in this.</p>
<p>(2) Emotion and Reason</p>
<p>In general, the relationship in friendship is mostly composed of emotion, but blindly immersed in emotion, waiting until it exceeds the limit, is like a runaway horse, which is quite dangerous. Often there are kinds of friends who are very enthusiastic. Once the emotions are indulged and break down, they are regarded as strangers, what a pity! Therefore, it is really not very reliable to maintain friendship solely from the effect of emotion. It must cooperate with one's own reason to be able to "complement each other," because emotion can sometimes be hypocritical and sometimes abnormal. For example, in the process of love between male and female friends, no matter how close the emotions of both parties are, if there is a lack of rational judgment, it is inevitable to cause a lot of trouble. Rational male and female friends should talk about love, but even if "the falling flowers are intentional and the flowing water is merciless," the friendship can still be maintained, which is so valuable. In any matter, "too much and not enough" will have the result of "the extreme of things will turn against them." Emotion is also the same. It is not good to be too strong, and it is not good to be too weak. It is certainly important for friends to be rich in emotion, but when necessary, reason is more important, because it can grasp emotion and prevent it from tending to extremes.</p>
<p>(3) Astuteness and Loyalty</p>
<p>People's hearts are different, each like their face. There are naturally all kinds of friends, and the two kinds of friends that are obvious are "astute" and "loyal." Both astute friends and loyal friends are beneficial to everyone. Because in astute friends you can understand a lot of worldly affairs, and in loyal friends you can get honest and selfless criticism as well as virtues that are helpful for being a person. I think that if astute friends will not "harm others to benefit themselves," then using them to benefit the masses, their achievements will certainly be very impressive. As for loyal friends, in this society, they are almost regarded as good old gentlemen and are often easily deceived. This is unfortunate for the deceived, but deceiving good people is not a glorious thing after all! At the same time, loyal friends are easily tricked by astute friends because of their own honesty. Therefore, on the one hand, I hope that everyone will promote the spirit of friendship and sympathize with loyal friends, and on the other hand, loyal friends themselves should always look at the objective environment. Finally, I hope that astute friends will pay more attention to their learning and abilities, and do not be astute only to friends, but fall into meanness and selfishness.</p>
<p>(4) Loyalty and Mutual Assistance</p>
<p>"There are only friends for a thousand years, and no masters for a thousand years." Although this sentence seems excessive, it is indeed a fact that the relationship between friends is better than that of masters and relatives. This is the power of "loyalty" flowing through. Loyalty and friends are the most valuable things. There are many famous loyal friends in history, who are truly loyal and immortal. Friends with loyalty can maintain their friendship for a long time and show their greatness: and the spirit of mutual assistance in loyalty is even more valuable, and mutual assistance in times of trouble is even more rare. The saying goes: "Giving me the benefit of surplus can broaden virtue; leaving people with inexhaustible feelings can complete friendship." Therefore, you should let go of your feelings for friends, because this is the loyalty of friends, the condition of mutual assistance, and the days of friendship are long. Helping friends is no different from helping yourself. In short, those who help should regard this as the mutual assistance spirit that human beings should have and the duty that friendship should fulfill, and those who are helped should also have the loyalty of "gentlemen do not forget their roots."</p>
<p>Friends are the reality of life. The author has not experienced much of the world, and my talents are shallow and my knowledge is thin. What I have said is all superficial, and there are many things that have not been exhausted. This still needs everyone to correct me.</p>
<p>Last Year's Industrial Economy in This City Changed from "Laissez-faire" to "Control"</p>
<p>Obstructed Overseas Sales, Increased Number of Factories Closing Down, Authorities Implemented Management, Industries Saw Ups and Downs</p>
<p>The Public Works Department recently released the annual report of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department, saying that the department undertook several emergency tasks in the first few months of last year, such as registering industrial raw material inventory, investigating the annual raw material needs of factories within the boundary, and cooperating with other authorities to implement population evacuation plans. The enforcement of price limits was handled concurrently by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department before the establishment of the Goods Control Office. In addition, the new tasks added to the department last year included the issuance of sublease licenses, the establishment of employment agencies, and the search for original families and foster families for lost and abandoned children.</p>
<p>1. Industrial Conditions</p>
<p>Regarding the industrial situation last year, one point that is more noteworthy is the transformation of "laissez-faire economy" to "controlled economy." After the outbreak of the Pacific War, most of the Chinese and foreign commercial and industrial factories that continued to operate lasted for about six weeks. Later, due to restrictions on the movement of inventory, the suspension of overseas sales, and the takeover of factories operated by nationals of belligerent countries, the number of factories closing down gradually increased.</p>
<p>Investigating Labor Conditions</p>
<p>Since the commercial markets of this port were isolated from overseas markets, this city had to rely on its own resources and raw material inventory. In view of this, the authorities gradually took measures to manage industrial activities. In March and July of last year, the relevant authorities conducted two investigations into the industrial and labor situation of the city as a basis for adjusting industries. At the same time, in order to maintain production efficiency under the principle of self-sufficiency in production, the China-Japan Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association and important Chinese commercial factory groups were organized. The permits for the movement of raw materials and manufactured products could be obtained through these associations. Later, raw materials and coal were also distributed separately through these associations.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Black Market Transactions In February of last year, due to the Chinese New Year, the commercial market stagnated, and thus the industry declined even more. However, the establishment of the above-mentioned China-Japan Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association and other organizations boosted the revival of Chinese commercial factories. From March to June, the output of most factories suddenly became popular. In view of the difficulty in obtaining raw material supply and the sharp increase in manufacturing costs, the factories gradually increased the selling price of their products. When the Central Reserve Bank notes were circulated and the old legal tender was depreciated, merchants and speculators competed to search and purchase, and exchanged cash for goods. By June, the currency system problem had stabilized, and the short-term development of the above-mentioned industrial sector returned to normal due to the authorities' tightening of price controls, but speculation remained active. The relevant authorities decided to take strong measures to crack down on black market transactions. For example, the bureau stipulated the retail price limit for gauze in October, and implemented the highest factory wholesale price for gauze from December 1. At the same time, it organized the registration of gauze inventory. The authorities are now trying to promote the commercial relationship between this port and various countries in the Co-prosperity Sphere. The future of Shanghai will become brighter due to the authorities' efforts to promote the adjustment and progress of the city's industry.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the more important industries:</p>
<p>(1) Cotton Mill Industry At the beginning of last year, all cotton mills owned by nationals of belligerent countries, as well as general cotton mills registered by nationals of belligerent countries but actually operated by Chinese merchants, were seized by the authorities. By May, seven such Chinese commercial factories had been returned separately. After the return, they gradually resumed work. At that time, the Central China Controlled Cotton Association had been organized and established, and the China-Japan Cotton Mill and Cotton Industry Bank had joined the association. The association sent personnel to the cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to purchase cotton at the prescribed prices and distribute it to member factories, so as to replace imported cotton. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Chongming District Office Adjusts Jurisdiction Area</p>
<p>Expanded to Ten Sub-Districts</p>
<p>Citizen Certificates to be Issued by the End of the Month</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the future Qingxiang and seek to enhance the effectiveness of the work, the Chongming District Office specially convened a meeting of all Chongming Township and Town Chiefs, and decided to expand the existing four administrative sub-districts to ten sub-districts, and reorganize the jurisdiction area. This method will be implemented after being submitted to the Municipal Government and the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch for approval. At the same time, it was also decided to prepare 1.6 million bamboo poles for the purpose of blocking bamboo fences. Residence permits will be issued by the end of March, so that people can obtain convenience during Qingxiang.</p>

<h3>Forthcoming Implementation of Rationing by Population; New Prices for Oil and Sugar Announced; Ration Amount for March is Half a Catty per Person; Sugar Price Reduced to Approximately 5.5 Yuan per Catty in Reserve Coupons; Oil Price Set at 1.8 Yuan per Municipal Catty in Military Certificates</h3>
<p>After the Oil Industry Wholesalers' Association and the Grain Merchants' Cooperative Business Office received approval from the military rationing authorities to implement oil and sugar rationing based on population, they entrusted the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) and the French Municipal Council (FMC) with handling the issuance of oil and sugar purchase certificates in the Public Concession (including Hongkou) and the French Concession areas. These certificates have been successively issued along with household grain ration cards, consisting of two coupons for edible oil and one coupon for sugar. As for the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Huxi districts, the Wholesalers' Association and Cooperative Business Office will handle the process themselves. The entire city has been divided into areas, and the re-registration of oil and sugar retailers has been completed. Consumers can purchase oil and sugar from designated retailers by presenting their purchase certificates. Recently, the authorities approved and announced the new prices for oil and sugar and are expediting the distribution of rationed oil and sugar to retailers. According to information obtained by a Shanghai Press reporter from relevant sources, the quantity of oil and sugar rationed per person will be determined by the monthly allocation from the military rationing authorities. In March, the ration for both oil and sugar is half a catty per person. The date for purchase will be announced once the retailers are ready. The newly set prices for oil and sugar are listed below:</p>
<p>Sugar Price</p>
<p>After the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office announced the newly set sugar prices on the 26th of last month, the authorities have now approved a slight reduction. The announcement states: "As sugar rationing by population is about to be implemented, this office, in order to uphold the intentions of the rationing authorities, is willing to make sacrifices and temporarily reduce sugar prices. With the approval of the authorities, we will sell sugar according to the following prices starting from March 2nd. All Class A retailers and consumers are hereby notified: (1) Military Certificate prices: coarse granulated sugar 1 yuan, snow-white sugar 1 yuan, Dutch red sugar 9.5 jiao, brown sugar 9.5 jiao, rock sugar 1.15 yuan; (2) Reserve Certificate prices: coarse granulated sugar 5.56 yuan, snow-white sugar 5.56 yuan, Dutch red sugar 5.28 yuan, brown sugar 5.28 yuan, rock sugar 6.39 yuan. The above prices are for 16-tael scales with sufficient weight. Retail tax of 1% is extra."</p>
<p>Oil Price</p>
<p>The Edible Oil Industry Wholesalers' Association issued a notice regarding the revised edible oil prices: "As stipulated by the authorities, the revised prices for various edible oils are as follows: (1) Rapeseed oil: Military Certificate 1.785 yuan per municipal catty; (2) Uncooked oil: Military Certificate 1.887 yuan per municipal catty; (3) Sesame oil: Military Certificate 1.836 yuan per municipal catty; (4) Soybean oil: Military Certificate 1.836 yuan per municipal catty; (5) Cottonseed oil: Military Certificate 1.785 yuan per municipal catty. The above prices are per municipal catty, and the retail price including the additional 2% sales tax. The prices for all types of edible oil will be implemented from March 1st. The rationed oil will be available for purchase soon. Once the arrival of edible oil is confirmed, the authorities will determine the date of sale and issue another announcement."</p>
<h3>Increased Grain Ration in the City Area; Starting from the Sixth Period, 2.5 Sheng Per Period</h3>
<p>After the City Grain Administration Bureau implemented grain rationing by population in the city area, manipulators of rice prices in the city lost their basis. However, the grain rationed per period was still insufficient. Therefore, the Grain Administration Bureau decided to increase the ration to 2.5 sheng per period starting from the sixth period. This will be implemented uniformly in Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, Pudong, and other districts.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau Officially Reorganized; Still Headed by Li Kaichen</h3>
<p>The former Ministry of Communications' Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau in this city, under the leadership of Li Kaichen for several years, has now been reorganized as the Ministry of Construction. Mr. Li has been reappointed to continue overseeing the bureau's affairs. Mr. Li went to Beijing a few days ago to consult with Minister Chen and has returned to Shanghai. The official reorganization will take place on the 1st of this month, and personnel adjustments will be made simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Average Combination of Brown Rice and White Rice; Attention Should Be Paid When Collecting Household Rice</h3>
<p>Due to the recent inclusion of both brown rice and white rice in the whole rice component of the two recent ration periods, the grain administration authorities in the two concessions are striving for fairness in the distribution of whole rice to each rice store, ensuring an equal opportunity for residents to obtain white rice. According to a Great News Agency reporter, the authorities are dispatching personnel to various locations for secret surveillance to prevent retail rice stores from taking advantage of differences in grain quality and engaging in private malpractices. If it is discovered that a store is selling brown rice from this period, which was not allocated by the authorities, to food consumers with purchase certificates instead of the required white rice, they will be penalized with the revocation of their license and a permanent termination of their business rights. The authorities also hope that residents will report any discovery of the above-mentioned private malpractices in consideration of their own interests and the future of grain distribution.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Gradually Resumes Operations in Six Locations Including Nanjing; Depositors Requiring Receipt and Payment in Shanghai Can Contact the Shanghai Branch to Arrange Transfer Procedures</h3>
<p>The Bank of China will gradually relocate its branches in Nanjing, Yangzhou, Wuxi, Jiaxing, Wuhu, Nantong and other six locations back to their original sites to resume business. After relocating, these branches will no longer handle receipts and payments in Shanghai. All depositors of these branches who need to receive and make payments in Shanghai can immediately go to the bank at 50 Hankou Road to handle the transfer procedures. The names of the locations where the deposits of each branch are located are recorded below.</p>
<p>Nanjing Branch (Baixia Road, Daxing Palace, Xuejia Lane, Zhongzheng Chong, Xiaguan): Deposits from Chuxian, Liuhe, Qingjiangpu, Huai'an (Jiangbian area), Danyang, Bengbu (Erma Road, Jingyi Road), Xuzhou (Datong Street outside the city), Nansuzhou, Mingguang, Linhuaiguan, Huainan Coal Mine, and other places are all consolidated here.</p>
<p>Yangzhou Branch: Deposits from Taixian, Dongtai, Yancheng, Funing, Dongkan, Xinpu (Dongda Street, Xida Street), Banpu, Qingjiang, Xiangshui Estuary, Duigou Port, and other places are all consolidated here.</p>

<h3>French Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Check Identity Cards; Those Without Identity Cards or With Folded and Damaged Cards Will Be Taken to the Police Station and Fined 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities distributed resident identity cards to residents within the concession as early as last year. To prevent spies, thugs, and petty thieves from hiding, they have notified all residents to carry these resident identity cards when going out. On one hand, each police station dispatches personnel to conduct household re-inspections in conjunction with the Baojia chiefs to prevent any omissions. The French authorities, fearing that residents within the concession might become negligent over time or forget to carry their resident cards, have, starting a few days ago, dispatched detectives from each police station to check the resident identity cards of men and women pedestrians on various roads and streets within their jurisdiction. Those who are found without a card or who intentionally fold and damage their cards will be taken to the police station and fined 10 yuan. They are also instructed to carry their cards at all times in the future and not to fold them arbitrarily, otherwise the penalty will be increased. It is said that women account for the majority of those caught.</p>
<h3>More Than 6,000 Packages of Green and Yellow Soybeans Have Been Distributed; Goods Can Be Picked Up and Distributed Within Days</h3>
<p>The military rationing authorities transported approximately 6,000 packages of yellow and green soybeans from Xuzhou and Nanjing last month. The Grain and Miscellaneous Grain Association's Miscellaneous Grain Group is responsible for the distribution. The group has already notified various retailers of both raw and cooked goods to register. It is understood that the group has completed the registration procedures for all retailers, and the funds have also been collected. Therefore, distribution package application forms have been separately completed and submitted to the military rationing authorities for approval and for separate removal certificates. After these removal certificates are approved and issued in approximately two or three days, the goods can be picked up and distributed to the various retailers.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief in This City Continues</h3>
<p>Since the reorganization of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the transfer of its managed affairs, the Winter Relief for the 31st year of the Republic is still being held as ordered. The Winter Relief Office received the second batch of 100 bags of Saigon broken rice yesterday and allocated it to the Nanshi and Huxi porridge factories for porridge distribution. According to statistics, over 5,000 elderly, weak, and women eat porridge every day. If the porridge distribution period is extended, it will greatly benefit the poor. Over 7,000 sets of cotton clothing will be completely manufactured by the 10th of this month and will be distributed to various districts and applicant groups for distribution. In addition, the fundraising work for the Winter Relief expenses for the 31st year has been ordered to be completed. The receipts and expenditures are currently being prepared, and a record of all donations will be publicly announced to all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee Merged into the Social Welfare Bureau; Over 160,000 Yuan of Relief Funds Transferred; Outstanding Matters Will Continue to Be Handled</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee has merged into the Social Welfare Bureau and was handed over on March 1st. At 10 a.m. that morning, five members from the Social Welfare Bureau, including Secretary Hu Shouqi, and others, along with Shanghai Special Municipal Government Commissioner Shen Zhenji, went to the branch at Xinzha Road to take inventory. All branch staff handled the handover of their respective responsibilities. A total of 14 volumes were transferred, including public property, assets, staff receipts, and expenditure records. Over 160,000 yuan in relief funds were transferred. The Winter Relief for the 31st year was transferred as a special project, and the Welfare Bureau will continue to handle unfinished porridge relief matters. The preparatory work for the Shanghai Children's Education Institute will also be taken over by the bureau. It is said that this organizational restructuring is in accordance with central regulations and is a consolidation. All staff will continue to work as usual.</p>
<h3>Statement by Matsuda, Deputy Spokesman for the Japanese Army: Indian People Demand Freedom; British Appeasement Has Failed</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Allied News Agency's Shanghai office states that Mr. Matsuda, the Deputy Spokesman for the Army, stated at Tuesday's press conference that the danger of Britain losing India has never been greater. When commenting on the situation of the British army in India and its attempts to recapture Burma, Mr. Matsuda believed that only action could be taken due to the results of past events, and criticized Britain for suppressing India. Recently, the Japanese air raids on Calcutta and New Delhi have greatly inspired the people. This kind of hint is extremely significant. Welcoming old friend Japan to India, Japan's attack on India as an "Asian friend" is actually intended to save India from the scourge of war, while the British do the opposite. Britain's mistaken view is that Burma can be regained, India's food problem can be solved, and anti-British sentiment can be eliminated. As a result, military operations are occurring on the Burmese-Indian border. The Indian people demand freedom, and this kind of appeasement has completely failed. Britain's dilemma can be seen from the fact that troops from South Africa and the United States are being deployed to reinforce the British troops stationed in India. Of all the territories that the British want to continue to control, none is more important than India, so they are giving the Indian army equal treatment to show their gentleness, but this is precisely enough to promote India's independence. The Indian people's desire is to expel the rule of British imperialism from the country. Various actions cannot gain the trust of the Indian people.</p>
<h3>Rubber Shoes Should Be Used Economically; Purchases Still Limited to Rainy Days</h3>
<p>Due to the increasing number of people buying and selling rubber overshoes for profit, the Rubber Overshoe Trade Association and its member stores in this city have formulated purchasing restrictions to maintain the supply for legitimate users. Overshoes are only sold on rainy days and are absolutely not available on sunny days. Buyers must present their property tax receipts and corresponding citizen ID cards from the two concessions or the city, and must wear the overshoes on the spot. After the implementation of these measures, hoarding and profiteering have gradually disappeared. However, as overshoes are a daily necessity for citizens, purchases are still very enthusiastic. The problem has become more serious in recent days. On days with light drizzle, large numbers of citizens rush to rubber overshoe stores to buy them. Store authorities even pull down iron gates to maintain order. According to people in the industry, rubber is one of the necessities in wartime and should be economized. Therefore, they urgently hope that citizens will strive for economy in their wearing habits.</p>
<h3>French Concession Subletting License Office Relocated</h3>
<p>The French Concession's Subletting License Office has moved from today onwards due to insufficient space in its original location to the first floor of the French Postal Steamship Company Building at No. 9 Bund, Avenue Edward VII. In the future, all matters related to subletting licenses for houses within the concession must be applied for and approved at that location.</p>
<h3>Engaging in Securities Transactions Requires First Obtaining a License from the Authorities; Individuals and Partnerships, Regardless of Nationality, Are Subject to the Same Regulations; Severe Penalties Will Be Imposed for Future Violations</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Notification No. 6181 states: "Notification is hereby given that, in accordance with Clause 34 of the Land Regulations Appendix, as stipulated in this Council's Notification No. 5965, all persons, partnerships, commercial firms, companies or associations, regardless of nationality, who engage in the transaction of valuable securities must first obtain a license from this Council before being permitted to operate. It has been observed that violations of this regulation are increasingly frequent. Therefore, this notification is issued to inform all that, from today onwards, anyone found to be engaging in the transaction of valuable securities without obtaining a license from this Council will be severely dealt with. Such violators will be subject to the closure of their business premises and other severe penalties. This notification is specially issued for general knowledge. This notice is dated March 2, 1943. Signed, Seiichi Ozawa, General Manager."</p>

<h3>From the Return of Concessions to a Few Points for Improvement in Nanshi</h3>
<p>— San Jin</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the diplomatic relations between China and France, the French government, following the friendly nation of Japan, signed an agreement with our country to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. It can be seen that the Shanghai municipal administration will soon be unified. Not only are the citizens of Shanghai feeling infinitely excited, but the people of the whole country, and even the countries that are friendly to us, are all celebrating in unison. However, our responsibilities have become even greater, because we must not only maintain the status quo of the concessions, but also carry them forward; not only must we carry forward the concessions, but we must also strive to improve the city's administrative power and keep pace with the concessions, so as to avoid abnormal situations and complete the long-standing Greater Shanghai Plan. This is the only way to live up to the good intentions of friendly nations in returning the concessions. For example, Nanshi has the following points that urgently need improvement:</p>
<p>(1) Public Announcements on a Regular Basis. The previous rationing method for rice and flour in Nanshi was not the same as in the concessions. It is hoped that in the future, public announcements will be made on a regular basis, and the quantity will be the same as in the concessions. This will be more convenient for residents.</p>
<p>(2) Clearing Garbage. The City Police Headquarters has issued a notice to eliminate unsanitary habits in order to effectively maintain public health in the city. It has strictly prohibited the dumping of garbage on the side of the road, defecating anywhere, and spitting arbitrarily, as these are likely to spread epidemic diseases such as tuberculosis. Violators will be punished. However, the first step in prohibiting the dumping of garbage on the side of the road is to thoroughly clear away the mountains of garbage that are piled up everywhere. Then, the police teams should be instructed to assist in prohibiting the dumping of garbage on the side of the road, so as to emphasize hygiene and produce practical results.</p>
<p>(3) Restoring Traffic. Although the French government has signed an agreement with our country to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights, it may not be possible to implement it in the shortest possible time due to procedural matters. However, the full opening of the iron gates at the border between Shanghai's Chinese and French areas to restore the pre-war state can be implemented immediately. It is hoped that this can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Nanshi had trams and buses before the war, and buses were also running after the war. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, buses have been suspended and have not been restored. In order to facilitate transportation and rectify the city's appearance, it is hoped that tram or bus station traffic will be restored as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(4) Repairing Streets. Opening new roads or widening streets may not be easy to carry out for the time being, but repairing roads, especially clearing the debris on the streets, is easy to do. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>In short, the Shanghai municipal administration will soon be unified. Before the unification, everything in the city must be comparable to the concessions, so that there will be no gaps in the future. How about we ask the municipal authorities?</p>

<p>A dispatch from the Allied News Agency's Shanghai office states that according to Monday's report in the Continental New Paper, the Central Reserve Bank announced on Monday that its profits for 1942 were 17,462,000 yuan, an increase of 12,878,000 yuan compared to 1941.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Local Produce and Fruit Distribution Cooperative; Yang Yunwen and Others Elected as Directors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Central Market Central Local Produce and Fruit Industry Brokers Association has been in existence for nearly four years. The vegetables of millions of citizens in Shanghai all depend on it. Under the leadership of Chairman Yang Yunwen, the association's business is booming. Recently, in order to comply with the authorities' balanced distribution of materials, the association reorganized the original brokers into the Shanghai Special Municipality Central Market Local Produce and Fruit Investment Distribution Cooperative Co., Ltd. and held the founding meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday in the Central Market cafeteria. Hundreds of people, including Market Managers Tao Wenqi, Ikeda, Chengbei, and Kui Wenguang, as well as all the shareholders of the cooperative, attended the meeting. Yang Yunwen, Shen Yucheng, and Zheng Zhonghai were publicly elected as the presidium.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech. At 2 p.m., the meeting was opened with a bell. First, Yang Yunwen delivered a speech, stating that the cooperative was reorganized and established in order to seek the welfare of the Shanghai citizens and to balance the distribution of materials, and in accordance with the instructions of the Market Authority. Today, the founding meeting is being held, and it is a great honor to have so many guests and all the shareholders of the cooperative in attendance. From now on, the cooperative will continue to seek ways to improve and adapt to the wartime economic system, so as to conform to the purpose of balanced material distribution and achieve the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. After that, Market Managers Tao Wenqi, Ikeda, Chengbei, and others delivered speeches successively. Then, the voting began to elect the directors and supervisors.</p>
<h3>Central Market Handles Registration of Retailers; Registration Is Only Allowed with a License from the Authorities; Peddlers Must Verify Tax Payment Certificates and Citizen Certificates</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the wartime system, the Shanghai Central Market has submitted to the authorities for approval to reorganize the upper-level organization of the broker trading system into a distribution investment cooperative to unify the purchase and distribution of goods and strengthen the mission of the market's public institutions. Regarding the lower-level organization after the reform, all retail stores must be approved by the Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Council to register and issue licenses before they can be designated as retail stores and allowed to register, so as to improve distribution and ensure reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Name of Each Industry. As for the name of each industry, such as (1) Local Produce and Fruit Retailer, (2) Poultry and Egg Retailer, (3) Southern Goods Retailer, (4) Northern Goods Retailer, (5) Cured Meat Retailer, (6) Chinese Paper Retailer, (7) Grocery Retailer, (8) Tin Foil Retailer, (9) Wax Retailer, (10) Liquor Retailer, the above-mentioned retailers can go to register.</p>

<h3>Hoping All Sectors Donate at Any Time; Preparing for Next Year's Student Aid; Minsheng Bank Diverts Tea and Refreshment Expenses to Student Aid</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Readers' Student Aid Fund received a donation from Mr. Tang Zhiliang, who diverted funds saved from tea and refreshments at the opening ceremony of the Minsheng Commercial Savings Bank, and from Mr. Sun Qifang, who diverted funds saved from his wedding. This kind of advocacy for thrift and talent cultivation is of great significance to society and benefits young people. It is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Donate at Any Time, Regardless of Amount. The Shanghai News understands that the current cost of living continues to increase, and poor students will feel more difficult when enrolling or continuing their studies in the summer vacation of this year. As there is no hope of reducing tuition fees in various schools, the newspaper is praying that the general price level can be suppressed on the one hand, and on the other hand, it hopes that various schools will do their best to avoid placing excessive burdens on students. The Shanghai News Readers' Student Aid Fund is unwilling to slack off its initial intention to provide modest assistance when most students are in dire need of help. The next student aid fund will naturally still hope that all sectors will donate at any time. Increasing the balance by several hundred yuan today means reducing the number of students who drop out of school in the summer vacation by several students. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention to the urgency of this student aid matter and donate at any time, regardless of the amount, and pool the strength of the masses to complete the studies of poor children. This should be advocated and supported by people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Diverting Tea and Refreshment Expenses to Donate to Student Aid. The Shanghai News received a letter from the Minsheng Commercial Savings Bank yesterday stating: "Dear Sir, We are grateful for the presence and guidance of eminent figures from all sectors at our opening ceremony. As it is a time of special circumstances, it is appropriate to be thrifty. Therefore, we have diverted 15,000 yuan of tea and refreshment expenses to various scholarship institutions as scholarships, in order to assist the good intentions of guests from all sectors in cultivating young people. In addition to sending separate letters, we are also sending a certificate for 6,000 yuan. We hope that you will accept it and announce it to the public."</p>
<p>Student Aid Received Yesterday. The Shanghai News Readers' Student Aid Fund's income and expenditure report was published in yesterday's newspaper. As of the end of February, the balance was 217,284.52 yuan (the amount of student aid paid out in this term is calculated based on the number of checks issued before the end of February. Any student aid refunds or continued payments will be included in the next public announcement). On March 1, donations from various sectors of society totaled 602 yuan, and the donors' names were published in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, we continued to receive donations from various sectors of society, including 6,000 yuan from the Minsheng Commercial Savings Bank, 1,000 yuan from Tang Zhiliang, 200 yuan from Pei Ji, 100 yuan from Cao Changxing (whose son received the museum's student aid once in the past), 50 yuan from Chen Hailing (savings from his birthday), and 20 yuan from Pu Jiting (in memory of his late father, Liangbo). The total amount received was 7,370 yuan in reserve coupons, and the balance is 225,274.56 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wusong Gas Plant Increases Production; Monthly Increase of 10,000 Tons</h3>
<p>In order to meet the needs of industrial use, the authorities of the Shanghai Gas Company have notified all users to conserve gas as much as possible, and are actively increasing production at the gas plant in Wusong. According to the Great News Agency, the plan to increase production at the plant has been completed, with an increase of approximately 10,000 tons per month compared to before. This move will greatly benefit the industrial sector in this city.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Strives to Reform the Organization; Plans to Re-adjust the More Than 300 Trade Associations in the City</h3>
<p>Various Chinese business groups in this city are working separately to establish an autonomous control mechanism for Shanghai's economy, especially the movements of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which are attracting the most attention from all parties. It is said that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce plans to re-adjust the more than 300 trade associations in this city to establish an autonomous control of Shanghai's economy. The main goals are as follows:</p>
<p>Obtain Guiding Power</p>
<p>Taking the acquisition of the guiding power of all trade associations as a prerequisite, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce itself must first be reformed. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is currently discussing reform measures. The key points of the reform are to break away from the character of liberalism and possess the elements of the highest control institution, so as to obtain guiding power and expand and strengthen its own guiding strength. At the same time, it requires the National Government to transfer the power to guide the associations to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Reorganize Unit Associations</p>
<p>There are currently more than 300 trade associations in Shanghai. However, in order to control commodities, there should be merged associations, and there should also be separate and independent associations. Taking reasonable control as a prerequisite, they should be re-adjusted. The nature of the current associations is an organization that maintains the same industry, that is, a liberalist group with profit objectives. Therefore, it will fundamentally change its character so that it can develop into a unit organization that controls Shanghai's economy.</p>
<p>Establish an Intermediate Control Mechanism</p>
<p>The more than 300 unit trade associations will be classified according to their nature. In each category of trade associations, a federation will be set up, whose position is intermediate between the unit association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's autonomy control plan is roughly as above. Whether it can be fully realized is another matter. In general, it seems to have received the support of the umbrella dealers. (March 2, Continental News)</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>The Transformation of the Chinese Economy Should Be Epoch-Making</h3>
<p>The characteristic of the Chinese economy is that China has always been the world's largest consumer country, living on borrowed money with annual trade deficits ranging from a minimum of over ten million yuan to as much as eighty million yuan. It was not until after 1932 that the Chinese people gradually began to pay attention to construction, the immaturity of which is self-evident. In today's world of intense commercial warfare, where the law of natural selection prevails and only the fittest survive, no nation can survive in the global community if it focuses solely on consumption and neglects production.</p>
<p>To achieve China's self-reliance, a transformative shift in the Chinese economy is necessary, from a consumer nation to a producer nation. In the past, China's exports were mostly raw materials and foodstuffs, while imports were manufactured goods, especially luxury and consumer goods. This is entirely characteristic of a consumer nation. Although imports of machinery, tools, vehicles, and ships have become increasingly important since 1932, imports of consumer goods remain significant. China is a country uniquely blessed with abundant resources, and its self-sufficiency in raw materials should be considerable, with imports mainly focused on necessities for production. This is the first point.</p>
<p>As the ancients said, foreign debt can be borrowed, but China must not borrow foreign debt. These are painful words. If China can make good use of foreign capital in the future, then borrowing foreign debt is not entirely impossible. Utilizing foreign capital properly means importing essential production materials under conditions that do not harm China's sovereignty, and genuinely engaging in industrial development. In this way, foreign debt can be repaid quickly through increased production, and the temporary trade deficit during the use of foreign capital is not a major concern. Otherwise, if debt is used to import luxury goods, or even for purposes that harm China's productive capacity, then China will be trapped in the position of a consumer nation, which is a matter of grave concern. This is the second point.</p>
<p>China has always been an agricultural nation. It is estimated that among the 400 million people, farmers account for about 300 million. Therefore, the livelihood of farmers affects the entire economic lifeline of China. Given the vastness and fertility of China's land (the economic advantage of production lies in agriculture), China's production should primarily focus on agriculture. Therefore, special attention must be paid to improving farming methods, enhancing the quality of agricultural products, and reclaiming wasteland to lay the foundation for China's production. In addition, expanding into forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries will ensure that the country has ample resources. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Furthermore, major heavy industries must strive for self-sufficiency. Items essential for the lives of the people and the survival of the nation must be manufactured domestically. Transportation must be developed, and mineral resources must be exploited. The emphasis on agriculture does not mean neglecting industry and mining altogether; rather, they serve as supporting industries. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>The above four points are merely the most salient. To realize them, the government should have a comprehensive and detailed plan and policies. State-owned enterprises should be state-operated, and private enterprises should be guaranteed reasonable profits and incentivized by the government. The people should abandon their ingrained habits of consumption, be hardworking and resilient, unite and cooperate, and each strive in their respective roles, fulfilling their responsibilities as citizens. Then, the majority of the 400 million people, who are currently consumers, can be transformed into productive citizens. Only with this epoch-making transformation of the Chinese economy can the emergence of a new China be discussed.</p>
<h3>Total Tax Revenue of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces Over the Past Five Years</h3>
<p>The total unified tax revenue of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces over the past five years is as follows: 34 million yuan in 1938, 60 million yuan in 1939, 73 million yuan in 1940, 160 million yuan in 1941, and 230 million yuan in 1942.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Insists on Original Cost Accounting System: Explanation by President Suzuki of the Planning Board</h3>
<p>The Japanese side, recognizing that industrial strength is the foundation of enhanced war capabilities, considers the strengthening and establishment of the industrial system to be a matter of utmost urgency. Taking advantage of the Diet session, they carefully reviewed the matter again. On the 24th, at the Special Wartime Administrative Law Committee of the Diet, Mr. Takao Godo raised questions about the original cost accounting system. President Suzuki of the Planning Board provided detailed explanations and clarifications, dispelling misunderstandings about the authorities' intentions to ease the original cost accounting system.</p>
<p>Mr. Takao Godo: During the budget committee chairman's report at the previous House of Representatives meeting, I raised questions about original cost accounting. The government's response indicated that while it could not be completely suspended, it was also inconvenient to implement it fully. Therefore, the public misunderstood that the authorities intended to ease the original cost accounting system. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify the matter.</p>
<p>President Suzuki of the Planning Board: This issue centers on the problem of prices. Insisting on a low-price policy to increase production is the origin of the relationship between original cost accounting and price issues. The government is determined to adhere to a low-price policy while striving to expand production. To rationalize various industries and improve efficiency, it is necessary to insist on the original cost accounting system. The public's perception of prices reflects the public psychology after the implementation of these prices. Industry personnel should prioritize the nation. If they can abandon all characteristics of trade profit, the original cost accounting system would be unnecessary. However, based on past economic conditions, the private sector is not yet able to abandon trade profit. Therefore, there is no intention to ease the original cost accounting system, and it will be handled appropriately depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Takao Godo: The public misunderstands the President's words. Original cost accounting should not be considered as price regulation, but rather as a way to improve efficiency. The expansion and contraction of the price index, apart from original cost accounting, has no other way. This is the necessity of original cost accounting.</p>
<p>President Suzuki: Using original cost accounting to move from low efficiency to high efficiency is more important than price regulation.</p>
<p>Mr. Takao Godo: There are already implementations of the original cost accounting system. There are discrepancies in the original cost accounting. For basic industries receiving subsidies, they must comply with the original cost accounting system. The original cost accounting system must be fully adopted, but single original cost accounting is not appropriate. Easing the original cost accounting system must not be allowed.</p>
<p>President Suzuki: There is fundamentally no intention to ease original cost accounting. The original cost accounting system will be maintained based on the principle of not being divorced from reality.</p>
<p>After Mr. Godo and President Suzuki finished their questioning, they questioned the Army and Navy authorities for their views. The directors of the Army and Navy Accounting Bureaus replied separately as follows:</p>
<p>Director Kuribayashi of the Army Accounting Bureau: Currently, the Army authorities are diligently implementing the original cost accounting system, and the results are exceptionally good. It is deeply felt that the original cost accounting system is the most necessary for expanding productivity. In short, the Army authorities will gradually strengthen the original cost accounting system and strive for rationalized production.</p>
<p>Director Takei of the Navy Accounting Bureau: Regarding the implementation of the original cost accounting system, the Navy holds the same view as the Army. This system is the only way to improve efficiency. Factories under the Navy's jurisdiction have been using this method for the past twenty years, and there have been no changes to date. In the future, efforts will be intensified to popularize this system. (February 25, Yomiuri Hochi)</p>
<h3>Japan Increases Taxes on Non-Essential Goods to Reduce Unnecessary Consumption by the People</h3>
<p>Tokyo, March 31, Haitong News Agency: The Ministry of Finance, to reduce the purchasing power of the Japanese people in terms of unnecessary consumption, has increased various taxes starting today. Taxes on all luxury goods have been increased to 10 to 80 percent (previously 10 to 50 percent). Restaurant taxes have also increased significantly. Hotel bill taxes, previously 20 to 30 percent, have now been increased to 20 to 50 percent. Other taxes, such as gas, cinema, theater, and all entertainment taxes, have also increased significantly.</p>
<h3>Abolishing Import and Export Movement Restrictions Has a Very Positive Impact on the Economy: Mr. Shudo Talks After Inspecting North China</h3>
<p>Mr. Shudo, Deputy Manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank's Shanghai Branch, recently went to North China and Manchuria to inspect the economy. He spent over a month and has now returned to Shanghai. At 4:30 PM one day, he told reporters at the bank that the currency and prices in North China, as well as the purchase of goods, were quite smooth. The two major issues of suppressing prices and purchasing goods have been implemented since mid-February. After the abolition of import and export restrictions in Tianjin and Beijing, the situation has gradually improved. In the following conversation, Shudo hinted at many measures for purchasing goods and suppressing prices in Central China. He believes that after the abolition of import and export restrictions in Beijing and Tianjin, the purchase of goods and the suppression of prices have improved. Because after the restrictions were lifted, all controlled commodities could be freely imported and exported without the permission of the authorities (except for special commodities). Therefore, the Chinese side unanimously expressed their appreciation. The material distribution and purchasing agencies after the abolition of restrictions there are currently under preparation. Once they are ready, the distribution and purchasing matters can be handled by a fixed agency, and the flow of materials will be smooth. This situation is the same in Shanghai. If the flow of materials can be opened and the distribution and purchase of materials can be handled freely within the possible scope, then the flow of materials can be smooth, and prices can gradually stabilize. If the price of rice in Central China and the price of wheat in North China fall, then other prices can also tend to stabilize. The supply of all materials in North China is centered on the purchasing agencies in various places, which are engaged in purchasing important agricultural products such as cotton and wheat. The supply of cotton and wheat is very smooth. Regarding financial currency work, the Allied Reserve Bank notes are widely circulated in North China and are deeply trusted by the people. The amount of circulation is quite large, and all materials are traded in Allied Reserve Bank notes. There are more than 30 branches and offices of the United Reserve Bank. In addition, there are the North China Provincial Bank and other Chinese banks, which unanimously assist in the work of Allied Reserve Bank notes. The ratio between the Japanese yen and the Allied Reserve Bank notes will not change in principle. (Translated from the March 2nd Continental News)</p>
<p>Economic Translation and Discussion</p>
<h3>The Question of the Reopening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange</h3>
<p>Shanghai originally had two stock exchanges, one being the Chinese-owned Chinese Stock Exchange, and the other being the foreign-owned (mainly British and American) Shanghai Stock Exchange. The former, although having the name of a stock exchange, did not have the reality of a trading market for Chinese corporate capital, and only engaged in turbulent public debt speculation, eventually leading to its own decline. The latter traded 38 kinds of rubber and colonial stocks, as well as 155 kinds of stocks belonging to foreigners in China, including spinning mills, canals, banks, and insurance companies. Since the Japanese army occupied the concessions, these two stock exchanges have been in a state of closure.</p>
<p>However, the trading of securities in Shanghai will never disappear due to the closure of the above two stock exchanges. After the incident, powerful speculative funds tried to escape funds by secretly purchasing foreign exchange, foreign stocks, and depositing soft currency in foreign banks. With the elimination of foreign forces, they turned to purchasing Chinese stocks, causing an improper surge in stock prices in large and small trading markets outside the two exchanges. The number of various stocks also increased sharply, with the number of trading companies after the Greater East Asia War increasing from 19 to 128. This extremely unhealthy state intensified due to the increase in speculative funds, and at the end of last year, the policy of allowing the stock exchange to reopen was announced.</p>
<p>Regarding the reopening of the stock exchange, the authorities of the Asia Development Board first spoke on October 30 as follows: The Shanghai Stock Exchange will be reopened under military management. Under the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, trading of Chinese stocks and central and local public bonds will be allowed, with the aim of reviving the economy of the peaceful areas. Therefore, strict measures will be taken to crack down on speculation as before. Secondly, on December 2, the Shanghai Embassy Office announced the application for traders and registered objects. Registered objects will be limited to Chinese stocks for the time being, and other various securities and public bonds will be registered after the opening of business depending on the situation. It is hoped to guide investment into important industrial sectors.</p>
<p>The above announcement of the reopening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange caused a great response from all parties concerned, and they urgently awaited its realization. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has been delayed and has not yet reopened, and it is rumored that there are some entanglements, probably because various difficult problems will arise when it is implemented. Establishing a securities exchange in Shanghai is necessary not only for the future, but also for the current realistic problems. The points officially announced by the authorities cannot be regarded as having no further developments. Various measures will eventually be taken to realize it. Now, assuming that we leave this issue aside, what mission does the Shanghai Stock Exchange have under the Greater East Asia War?</p>
<p>According to the announcement of the embassy, the purpose of the reopening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange is to guide national capital into the necessary industrial sectors under the appropriate management of stock prices. Studying the situation after the opening of business, not only will Chinese stocks be limited, but also various other securities and public bonds will be included, possibly including the various companies related to the revitalization of Central China, rubber stocks, and various other Japanese stocks. For all important industries and investments in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is difficult to complete solely by reopening the stock exchange, because the interest rate in China is as high as 30 percent, so a dividend of 5 or 6 percent is not enough to become an investment target. Assuming that funds are used for speculative operations, the result will inevitably make the buying and selling of such stocks very popular, but this trend will also affect other regions, which is still not a good phenomenon. To guide funds into the necessary industrial sectors, no matter what method is used, is not the task that should be assigned to the Shanghai Stock Exchange in the current wartime situation.</p>
<p>Secondly, what about the supply of funds for various industries operated by the Chinese? The current so-called fierce search for Chinese stocks has nothing to do with the business of the various enterprises. For example, the textile industry, due to the insufficient supply of raw cotton, the supply of power is not expected to improve, and the sales channels are also becoming narrower, so there is no reason to be optimistic about its future. However, textile stocks are rising abnormally. The publications of various bookstores have almost been cut off, but cultural-related stocks are also rising similarly. The object of investment does not regard its own business, but regards the value of its assets as the standard of selection.</p>
<p>Not only that, but under the above-mentioned difficult production conditions, more stocks are actually increasing capital. About 50 Chinese enterprises increased production in the second half of last year, and the most serious case was an increase of 24 times in two years. The main reasons for increasing capital are the soaring prices, the expansion of assets, and the jump in old capital. China originally had few decent industries other than textiles and flour mills. In addition to the above-mentioned actual situation of Chinese stocks, it is difficult to treat the Shanghai Stock Exchange with the scale of advanced countries introducing industrial funds. Therefore, the current reopening of the stock exchange should aim at adopting measures to deal with speculation and stimulate the expansion of speculative funds. Although the reopening of the stock exchange cannot hope to guide speculative funds into national capital, it can be said to be a great harvest if it can slightly reduce the speculation in the stock market. Mobilizing the production funds of the Shanghai market is an urgent task that should be planned for in the future. If there is cooperation from the Chinese side, more bold measures can be taken.

<h3>From the Anguish of Enterprises: On the Future of Enterprises</h3>
<p>In the sixth issue of the first volume of "Enterprise Weekly," Mr. Guo Zuxiao has an article entitled "The Anguish of Enterprises." In this article, Mr. Guo wrote about the various anguishes of the current business community in a very systematic manner, representing the business community in shouting out the depression in their hearts. Now, in this heavy anguish, we have already seen a bright path: Following this path, we will be able to reach the bright shore, as long as we see whether we have the determination to take this path and how to take this path. What is this path? It is the wartime economic policy guidelines formulated by the first plenary meeting of the National Economic Committee of the National Government on February 12.</p>
<p>The passage of the wartime economic policy guidelines is the most significant achievement of the National Government since it declared war on Britain and the United States. Although the government will also formulate various wartime policy guidelines suitable for the needs of the situation after the war in other areas besides the economy, such as politics, military affairs, and education, etc., in view of the fact that the people's livelihood is the ultimate goal of all problems, we stand at the position of the industrial and commercial business community and say that the passage of the wartime economic policy guidelines is a great achievement that transcends everything, which is naturally not too much.</p>
<p>The wartime economic policy guidelines include a total of five items and 22 articles, none of which are not aimed at the shortcomings of the current economic community, and none of which are not suitable for the needs of the current economic community. It can be said to be a refreshing prescription for curing the anguish of the business community. But: We must know that it is easy to set a direction, and after setting a direction, we must continue to practice in order to receive the expected effect, and this effect is the price of hard practice.</p>
<p>From the formulation and promulgation of these wartime economic policy guidelines by the authorities, we can clearly see the determination of the authorities, but it is not enough to rely on the determination of the authorities alone. To make the process of practice more effective, it must rely on the cooperation of the private sector, especially the industrial and commercial business community.</p>
<p>Therefore, I cannot but talk about the issue of prices first. The issue of prices is the foundation of all economic issues. The purpose of solving the entire wartime economic policy guidelines is nothing more than the issue of prices: Only under the premise of stable prices can all economic facilities and various legitimate businesses be able to seek their legitimate and substantial development in stability. Then, we can accurately control our business. May I ask: Do we need such an environment and situation?</p>
<p>The best development of industrial and commercial enterprises is the development in stability as mentioned above. Although there are examples of making profits behind closed doors by relying solely on rising prices, that is a false profit. The current hoarding mentality believes that holding materials is always more valuable than holding currency or saving soft currency. They have a fundamental misconception of looking down on the credibility of currency or deposits: They do not know that the depreciation of the value of currency or deposits is due to the soaring value of materials. Currently, the currency circulating in the Hua Central and Hua South areas is the reserve coupon. Although the reserve coupon has increased in recent years, the large amount of old legal tender being withdrawn and prohibited from use, as well as the increasing expansion of the reserve coupon's circulation area, can be seen that its issuance has not reached the point of flooding, and on the contrary, we see a kind of artificial contraction. The means of that artificial contraction is to tighten the lending of the Central Reserve Bank to the same industry on the one hand, and to urge the same industry to hand over the legal part of the deposit reserve to the Central Reserve Bank to make the reserve coupon flow back; its purpose is to use this method of tightening currency issuance to create a tight silver root in the market to suppress this speculative hoarding atmosphere. Who knows that the silver root in the market is indeed tight, but this speculative hoarding mentality is still not easy to eliminate. It can be seen that to seek a reasonable solution to the price problem, it is not enough to start purely from the currency side. After this speculative hoarding atmosphere spreads and becomes the ordinary hoarding mentality in society, not only is the general industrial and commercial community unwilling to sell their goods in large quantities, but also all classes of the people are unwilling to maintain their purchasing power and are eager to purchase non-urgent materials, which makes the industrial and commercial community have the anguish that even if they are willing to sell their goods, they cannot replenish them at the original price. So: price increases, panic buying, with limited materials, for insatiable demands, prices rise faster for reasons other than productivity and transportation. After such a vicious cycle is created, most people's energy is spent on unnecessary waste, so: the shrinkage of production capacity is formed, which in turn creates a vicious cycle. As prices continue to rise in this way, everyone's mind has the illusion that prices will continue to rise, but they do not know that this mentality is one of the important factors that contribute to the rise in prices. So: today, A has some currency in hand and uses it to purchase materials from B: tomorrow, B uses the currency to purchase materials from within, C from D, D from E, everyone only wants to purchase materials, and everyone only adds profits to the materials. Prices will certainly continue to rise, and the silver root will become tighter as a result. This is the other side of the relationship between prices and currency.</p>
<p>Since the rise in prices has formed the decline in currency value: the decline in currency value has also formed the expansion of industrial and commercial expenditures. Today's industry and commerce can make money without doing business behind closed doors, but they must always sell part of their goods to make up for their huge expenses. If this situation continues unchanged, there will always be a day when all the inventory on hand is completely transformed into expenses and consumed. Even if only a unit of goods is kept on hand, the book value is still thousands of times more than the capital. Do you hoarding people who only hope to make huge profits from rising prices and do not plan to serve the society from your own position, have you thought about it?</p>
<p>Since we know that the profits generated by the rise in prices are not true profits, we should fundamentally eliminate this hoarding and speculation mentality and stabilize prices at the current level. Then, under the supervision and guidance of the authorities, according to the guidelines set in the wartime economic policy guidelines, everyone should do their best, and everyone should devote themselves to improving production, transportation, distribution, and other institutions from their own position. From now on, consumers will no longer purchase more than they need or non-urgent materials, the industrial and commercial business community will no longer waste useful energy and time on the repeated investment of existing materials, and will no longer sell inventory to unscrupulous merchants who intend to hoard, everyone will regard the wartime economic policy guidelines as a mirror and use the courage to blame others to help themselves. Then, although the current enterprise is full of anguish, the bright future of the enterprise may be just around the corner. (Lu Tingfang)</p>
<h3>Special Feature on Prominent Figures in the Economic World</h3>
<p>— Mr. Lin Kanghou</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou, a native of Shanghai, Jiangsu, is currently sixty-eight years old. In his youth, he held innovative ideas. Upon reaching adulthood, he dedicated himself to improving education, having founded the primary school affiliated with Nanyang Public School, where he served as head for ten years. Throughout his life, he cultivated numerous talents, and many prominent figures in society have emerged from his tutelage. When the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang organized the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, he was in charge. Subsequently, he was recruited by the financial sector and served as the manager of the Shanghai branch of the New China Savings Bank. After 1921, he became the manager of the Shanghai Chinese Banking Corporation, while also prioritizing serving society. He participated in various Shanghai associations, such as charitable, public welfare, and commercial organizations. In 1927, when the National Government was established, he presided over the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, serving as chairman. The following year, he concurrently served as chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce. At that time, the Shanghai Banking Association appointed him as secretary-general, a position he held for seventeen years. In 1936, he served as the deputy head of the delegation to Siam (now Thailand). In 1938, he attended the 24th International Labour Conference and the 16th World Red Cross Conference. He also toured countries such as Britain, America, Germany, and Italy, returning home after more than half a year. Last spring, he returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong and, in accordance with his long-held aspirations to serve society, he resumed his role as secretary-general of the Banking Association and held key positions in other charitable and public welfare undertakings.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin is blessed with a naturally robust constitution, rarely suffering from illness throughout his life. He always maintains an optimistic outlook, never speaking harshly or looking sternly. He is kind and approachable in his interactions with others. He rises early every day and always attends meetings and banquets, no matter how busy he may be. He enjoys drinking alcohol, but not in excess. At the age of sixty, he gave up smoking. In his leisure time, he finds joy in practicing calligraphy, and many seek his work. His calligraphy follows the style of Li Bei Hai, exhibiting elegance and grace.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin, noting that the number of member banks has increased from only fifty-odd in the past to over one hundred and twenty today, believes that this progress is rare in the history of Chinese banking. He believes that it is important to establish a solid foundation to ensure the long-term prosperity of the Chinese financial sector. This is an issue worthy of study for those engaged in the banking industry. Mr. Lin believes that there is a shortage of qualified personnel in the banking industry. While there are many competent individuals, there are also those who are unqualified. Often, they lack the necessary skills in dealing with customers and handling procedures, and urgent training is needed to improve their professional development. He also stated that during the banking business hours of one to three o'clock, it seems that there is nothing to do. This waste of time is contrary to the ancient virtue of cherishing every moment. The authorities of each bank should pay attention to the employees' after-work hours and provide more guidance and training in technology and knowledge. At the same time, the bank should cultivate specialized talents. Otherwise, it would merely be adding a customer to the consumer industry, and the resulting malpractices, however minor, should not be ignored. Regarding the issue of commodity controls, Mr. Lin believes that the principle is good, but in China, with its vast territory and different customs, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions in order to be effective. Therefore, he believes that the methods of controlling essential goods still need to be studied and improved to achieve perfection. Regarding the items that are already under control, he believes that it is necessary to strictly crack down on the black market in order to maintain the livelihood of the people.</p>

<h3>Striving for Life</h3>
<p>— Wu Jing</p>
<p>I was chatting with a few salaried friends, and all we talked about was the same old complaint: "Life is hard."</p>
<p>Just then, a pair of birds outside the window were singing in the trees. One friend listened and said with great emotion: "Listen to those birds, how happy their lives are! Alas, we humans, the most intelligent of all creatures, are not as free as they are!"</p>
<p>The other friends present nodded in agreement, wishing they could instantly sprout wings and go sing on the branches too.</p>
<p>Writers often praise the carefree nature of singing birds and swimming fish in their works. When we read good poetry, we often feel "transcendent" and "ethereal" because poets praise fish and birds.</p>
<p>People struggle for life, either relying on others, or flattering superiors, or running around, or deceiving and intimidating, working hard both mentally and physically, and it is really not easy, especially in these extraordinary times. It is only natural to envy singing birds and swimming fish because of the difficulties of life.</p>
<p>However, from a biological point of view, this concept is wrong. According to biologists, all living things must struggle for life; the higher the living thing, the more complex the life, and the more difficult it is to make a living.</p>
<p>We see singing birds and swimming fish as free, but in fact, they spend a lot of energy looking for food, finding mates, and defending against enemies. How can they be carefree? What "bird happiness" or "fish happiness" is just human subjectivity. If singing birds and swimming fish are really full of happiness, then how can we explain "a bird startled by a bow" and "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer"?</p>
<p>In short, unless you don't want to be a living thing, if you want to be a living thing, especially a higher living thing, you must strive for life. Although there are many unreasonable things in the current society, we must strive to improve them and never be decadent and passive.</p>
<h3>A Casual Discussion on Insomnia</h3>
<p>— Zhong Ren</p>
<p>These days, insomnia can be said to be a common epidemic, especially among intellectuals and salaried workers.</p>
<p>The brains of intellectuals (including salaried workers) are specially trained institutions that are good at thinking. In peacetime, their thoughts are limited to the two areas of work and knowledge. Now, the cost of living is so high that they have added a difficult-to-solve problem of life to their brains. It's like adding a tangled hair to the mechanism of a clock. Naturally, it will make them worry and worry, and over time, it will become what is called insomnia.</p>
<p>Nineteen out of ten cases of insomnia are mental illnesses, which can be proved by the fact that one out of a hundred manual laborers suffers from insomnia. The only way to get sick is to consult a doctor, and the best thing to do when you have insomnia is to ask a doctor to diagnose it, because physical illnesses can also cause insomnia. However, if your insomnia is due to mental unrest, the doctor cannot give you much help. At most, he can only tell you some self-healing methods.</p>
<p>To treat insomnia, you must have a fixed time to get up and go to bed. You must go to bed at a certain time at night and get up at a certain time in the morning. This is a prerequisite for treating insomnia. Patients must develop good sleeping habits.</p>
<p>Rest is the main factor in sleeping well. When going to bed, all the nerves and muscles of the body must be relaxed at the same time, and must not be tense. When the brain is working at high speed, the body cannot get the rest it needs, which is why intellectuals often suffer from insomnia.</p>
<p>Physical fatigue alone cannot make people fall asleep. The participants in the bicycle endurance race can sit on the bicycle for five or six days in a row. During these days, he carries half an hour of sleep each time, and he must also work hard to fight. We always thought that he must sleep for a few days after the end of the game, but in fact he had to wait more than ten hours after the end to fall asleep, because he was overstimulated, and his nerves and muscles were still in a state of tension. He had to wait until the nerves and muscles were relaxed before he could fall asleep as usual.</p>
<p>Some people often say: "I can't sleep at all at night." He doesn't think his words are a bit too much. There is absolutely no one in the world who can't sleep at all. People with minor illnesses and pains often like to exaggerate their illnesses and pains. If he says: "I only slept for two hours last night." In fact, he probably slept for three or four hours, but the fact is that intermittent and discontinuous sleep every two or thirty minutes cannot completely restore the body's fatigue.</p>
<p>Some people often say: "I always have to go to bed very late to fall asleep, and I have to wake up very early in the morning." This person's insomnia is often due to psychological effects. He thinks that he must go to bed at two thirty to fall asleep, and as a result, he can't fall asleep until two thirty. He thinks that he must wake up at four thirty, and as a result, he wakes up at four thirty.</p>
<p>People who think they can't sleep well are nineteen out of ten cases of not sleeping well. This is a bit like hypnotism, because he believes that he can't sleep, so he can't sleep. Regardless of whether there is a physical illness or not, the treatment of insomnia has a significant relationship with the patient's mental attitude.</p>
<p>If you can eliminate worries and close your eyes to rest peacefully, insomnia will not have much impact. The worst thing is to worry. If you don't get enough sleep today but don't worry, you can make up for the lack of sleep tomorrow. As long as you can eliminate worries, insomnia is not a concern.</p>
<p>However, in the current situation, most people have many worries. Last summer, cholera, typhoid fever, and other infectious diseases were discovered in the city. Fortunately, the Public Works Bureau implemented strict epidemic prevention, and it did not become a major disaster. If someone could invent a surgery to cut off the root of insomnia for most people today, that would be Amitabha, and the merit would be immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Root</h3>
<p>— Xin Bo</p>
<p>"I've already spoken with Master Huang," Master Yang picked up the covered tea bowl and took a sip, but the tea didn't help his throat. The sounds coming out were still extremely hoarse, "Master Huang sees that you're really suffering!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes." He retreated two steps.</p>
<p>"Master Huang also considered my face!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes." He retreated two more steps.</p>
<p>"Finally, he agreed to buy your field!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes." He had retreated very far, not knowing where to retreat to.</p>
<p>"Genming, you sit here," someone said to him from behind.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes." He replied, turning around to see a pale-faced man of about his age, and continued, "Mr. Du Zhou, it's really cold today, I'm sorry to trouble you to come."</p>
<p>Saying that, he sat down on a round stool next to Mr. Du Zhou.</p>
<p>"Master Huang said," the hoarse voice was still ringing, "that piece of what field!"</p>
<p>"Old Stone," Genming replied.</p>
<p>"That piece of Old Stone is priced at fifty silver dollars."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes." He habitually replied twice, but immediately realized and changed his tone, "But, but..."</p>
<p>"But what? I persuaded him every way I could, and Master Huang finally considered my face and added four dollars, totaling fifty-four dollars, that's good enough."</p>
<p>"But, but..." Of course he didn't think it was good enough, but he couldn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Fifty-four silver dollars, isn't that good?"</p>
<p>"But, but..."</p>
<p>Master Yang said nothing more and began to puff on the water pipe Master Huang handed him.</p>
<p>Genming "butted" for a while and then stopped "butting." He was thinking, thinking about what words he could use to increase the amount by a few dollars.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a person at the account desk by the window turned around, took the cigarette out of his mouth, exhaled the smoke he had inhaled, and said lightly, "Old Gen, are you selling the field?"</p>

<h3>Eighth Place in the January Essay Contest, My Life (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>—A Glimpse of Life as a Clerk—</p>
<p>At this moment, I am writing this article as a "minimum" clerk in a money shop. However, in the past, I was not from a "regular" background, having apprenticed and studied for three years. It's embarrassing to say, but I used to make a living with a pen, serving as a so-called "uncrowned king," a journalist. But suddenly, I "left the priesthood halfway," abandoning the pen for the abacus, becoming inextricably linked with numbers. This is entirely the work of "the times" and "the environment." Even I feel like I'm dreaming, unable to control myself.</p>
<p>I was born into a middle-class family in an ancient city on the north bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu. My parents were married for more than twenty years and had ten children, including brothers, sisters, and me. As the "eldest son," this "full house of children," which others often call "blessed," was a heavy burden for my father. Therefore, he had high expectations for the "eldest son." He wanted to make me a talent to help him shoulder part of the burden. But with limited financial resources, he could only provide for me up to high school graduation. I couldn't afford to go to college. Since there was no hope of further education, I had to find a job in society. But at that time, I was just an eighteen-year-old high school student, and it was really not easy to find a job in the "overstaffed" job market. "Unemployed" at home, I had no way to vent my mental depression, so I borrowed a pen for recreation, often submitting articles to a local newspaper. Fortunately, the editor had a "keen eye," and my clumsy articles often appeared in the newspaper. The remuneration was of course very limited, but later, that editor became my "literary friend." He recommended me to the newspaper's president and invited me to edit the "supplement." The salary was also very low, but it provided room and board. At that time, I was young and eager to do good, and my desire to publish was very strong. Once I was "honored" as an editor, wielding scissors and paste and evaluating articles, I was as happy as a "king facing south." I didn't care about the meager salary. Unfortunately, a good dream doesn't last long. At the age of twenty, I married a woman I didn't know. After marriage, the "household expenses" increased day by day. The few dollars I received from the newspaper were not enough. My father and wife also didn't approve of me doing this all the time. Coincidentally, the "×× Railway Bureau" Car Service Department was recruiting prospective car service staff. A relative who worked at the bureau wrote a letter calling me to Shanghai to take the exam. Fortunately, I was admitted. But in the second month of my training at the "Railway Bureau" after painfully "giving up" my editing job, unfortunately, war broke out. Our training class was immediately disbanded. From then on, I followed my family, moving from place to place to escape the disaster, living a life of fear, displacement, and instability. It wasn't until the second half of the year before last that I returned to my hometown, where order had been restored. I was still "unemployed," but the soaring cost of living did not allow me to leisurely find a suitable job. So, relying on the favor of relatives, I "ate without choosing food" and squeezed into the money shop.</p>
<p>Speaking of money shops, they are generally considered to be the "nerve center" of commerce, second only to banks. They have a lot of money, and the living standards of employees are much better than in other industries. The work is easy, and there are fixed hours. This is certainly true, but the young people working in the money shop always feel that there are many places where they are not satisfied. To be honest, I am also "one of the dissatisfied." This is of course due to the lack of patience, fickleness, and fondness for the new and dislike of the old among young people, but this kind of "freehand" life has its own shortcomings. "There is no need to hide it." Let me explain a few points:</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Art Education</h3>
<p>— Boke</p>
<p>Crude production, deceptive lenses, can represent most of today's shadow plays; absurd structure, exaggerated performances, can represent most of today's dramas; the promotion of taste, the selling of gimmicks, can represent most of today's magazines. In them, you can't find art.</p>
<p>I don't know if the people who run them understand art. If they do, maybe there's something they can't help but pretend they don't understand, and don't express true art. If they don't understand, then of course there's even less to talk about.</p>
<p>If the kind of art they are now showing is not guided, supplemented, and corrected by true art education, where will our art flow to? I think no one can deny that our art will inevitably regress for thirty or fifty years, to the point of not knowing what it's talking about, until some future person with a heart comes along to start over. This is truly a huge waste!</p>
<p>Now, if there are those who can engage in true art education, then, whether it's an organization or an individual, we always welcome them. We are always willing to lend a hand to their cause, so that they can see its completion as soon as possible. At the same time, young people who love art are always more willing to receive this kind of education.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw the (China Art) Monthly, and visited its publisher, the "China Academy of Art," once, which gave me a lot of feelings. In today's world, people only know how to make money in shadow plays, dramas, and magazines, who still pays attention to art and art education. But I believe their work is precious, and the future will definitely tell us the truth.</p>
<p>However, we cannot but have true art, and we cannot but have active art education. However, in such a large city as Shanghai, there are only a few people engaged in this. How can this not make me feel infinitely emotional! (Remuneration for scholarship assistance)</p>

<h3>The Spirit of Mutual Assistance in Friend's Day</h3>
<p>Preferential Treatment for Teachers to Benefit Impoverished Children</p>
<p>(1) A letter from the Friendship Mutual Aid Medical Center: "Parents gave birth to me, friends love me. We are pleased to celebrate Friendship Day on March 3rd. Our hospital is named Friendship Mutual Aid. In order to repay the kindness of friends, we are holding a Friendship Free Medical Commemorative Week. Because life has been difficult recently and nutrition is difficult to provide, there are many people suffering from lung disease and skin disease. During this week, those suffering from the above-mentioned diseases can send a letter to inquire about their condition, or ask for research on difficult and complicated diseases. No fees will be charged. Those with lung disease who wish to go to a quiet place for recuperation (such as West Lake in Hangzhou) can also be introduced on their behalf, so as to reduce the pain of sick friends and fulfill the obligation of human mutual assistance." The address is at the intersection of Route Say Zoong and Route Cardinal Foch.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Tong Chi-leung is enthusiastic about public welfare and sympathizes with the poor and sick. He especially respects teachers. Now, taking advantage of this newspaper's organization of the Primary School Teacher Medical Aid Fund, he generously donated 1,000 dollars, saved from his grandson Kai-fong's wedding, to the aid fund. Mr. Tong's spirit of mutual assistance is truly an example for the general public.</p>
<p>(3) In response to this newspaper's Primary School Teacher Medical Aid Fund, Dr. Poon Bing-kui will provide free preferential treatment to all primary school teachers and poor students who are introduced by this newspaper or have written proof from the school. The clinic is located at No. 3, Lane 390, Fong Pan Road, Nanshi, every morning, closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>(4) A letter from Mr. Szeman: "I was very impressed after reading in your newspaper the plan to send orphaned children back to their hometowns. I have now heard that the Fu You Yuan is run by special staff, is seriously managed, and is economically transparent. In order to support its development, I donated 500 dollars from the 50th birthday banquet of Mr. Yim Ming-tak Tang to help with the needs of work-study programs. (Please ask the accountant of the hospital to prepare a receipt to be collected at this office.)</p>
<p>(5) Mr. Chan Hang-sun's grandson donated 50 dollars to the Notre Dame Infant Asylum for the sake of saving orphans, so as to create blessings for his ancestors.</p>
<p>(Please ask the treasurer of the hall to prepare a receipt to be collected at this office.)</p>
<p>Report on the Primary School Teacher Medical Aid Fund</p>
<p>(1) Tong Chi-leung (Savings from his grandson Kai-fong's wedding) 1,000 dollars. (2) Sheng Chun-yuan 200 dollars. (3) Chu Yin 100 dollars.</p>
<p>Total received: 1,300 savings certificates.</p>
<p>Balance: 41,558 dollars.</p>
