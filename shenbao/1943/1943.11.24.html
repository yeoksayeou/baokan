<h3 id="c1">重慶之命運（上）——重慶國民黨分裂之必然性 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>序論</p>
<p>有一天，德川三代將軍家光訪問名僧澤庵的寺院。當時，指着海上揚帆而航行的船，便問兩位禪僧說：有方法使那隻船立刻停止麼？一位禪僧立刻離座，悄悄把他前面的拉門（Paper　Sliding－door）關上；另一位禪僧，則在原位上坐着，雙目合起來。據說這就是當時禪宗對家光所作的有名答案。假如萬物都不過是人類思考的反映，那來停止思考船在航行，自然也就是眞的船在停止航行囉！誠然，對於絕對唯心論者來說，一切思念停止，就是萬物消逝的意思。然而這兩位禪僧的態度，按動物學的觀點來說，確有點像菲洲大砂漠上的駝鳥。據說，駝鳥被敵人追趕得無路可逃時，便把自己的頭鑽入砂土中。我們暫且分析一下駝鳥的心理作用，也許牠以為看不見敵人了，於是敵人也就早已不在了。現在像道樣駝鳥的人，尤其在從事政治工作者間，眞不知凡幾。我認為最近寫出「中國之命運」一書的蔣介石氏，也可以劃分到人間的駝鳥類裹來。這究竟是什麽道理呢？扼要地來說一句，這本書因為對於今日重慶國民黨的當前最大問題－與日本妥協呢？抑還是政權交與中國共產黨呢？非此即彼，二者必居其一的問題－，故意拋開不談，而只是把頭鑽人抗戰最後勝利的幻想砂土中，以求看不見當前現實中所存在着的國民黨分裂之危險。現在中國內外所發展着的現實，不管他主觀上知道或不知道，而危險的魔鬼仍然大步地走向前來。我們在此分析一下中國當前的現實，指出危險的必然性，這即使對蔣介石氏（或對眞正關懷中國之命運的人士），也不無小補吧！</p>
<p>答樂觀論者</p>
<p>我在十月二十四日，申報星期評論「答悲觀論者」一文中，會說過：「自從巴特里奥投降，以及德國在東綫上的撤退以來，不必諱言的，一部份中國人常中，悲觀論在發展着，例如他們在開始懷疑；德國也不久將走上意大利的同一命運吧！如果成為事實，那末處於大東亞地區的日本和南京政府，將碰到空前的困難吧！」。上海的這種悲觀論，如站在重慶那方面來看，就是樂觀論。似乎重慶方面認為歐洲問題，一定在今年內解決。如英美解決了歐洲問題，當然，正如羅斯福和邱吉爾所說，將用世界上兩大資本主義國家的全部戰鬭力，來打擊日本，那末日本一定經不起這種打擊，而會崩潰的吧！按具有這種見解的人來說，所謂「抗戰最後勝利」，是在這一年內，藉英美的力量，而就翩翩地飛入重慶的懷抱。這就是說，重慶只要張開懷，坐待世界局面的發展就可以了。</p>

<h3 id="c2">吉爾貝特島激戰沉燬美艦船七艘　日兩大尉實踐海軍魂精神 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日大本　二十三日下午三時發表：吉爾貝特羣打破方面，刻仍激戰中，尤其泰拉哇島方面，現正以登陸點附近為中心，展開激鬥，我海軍航空部隊及陸上部隊，自十九日以來，所獲戰果如次：　海軍航空部隊擊沉敵中型航空母艦一艘，驅逐艦一艘，擊毀敵大型航空母艦二艘（重創其中一艘或已沉沒），中型航空母艦一艘（重創或巳沉沒），戰艦（或巡洋艦）一艘（重創起火），運輸船一艘（重創起火）。擊落敵機三十六架（內三架不確）。　陸上部隊擊落敵機八十九架（內二十二架不確），我機自炸及未返基地者總計十五架。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　據此間軍事專家談：吉爾貝特羣島鄰近日本統治領馬沼爾羣島，在戰略上頗為重要，蓋美軍在吉爾貝桔羣島作戰，宛如在他人之門前出以偷竊之行為。蓋入南洋一帶為日本海軍之戰略圈，亦即日本國力絕大之發展圈。預料美軍在該方面作戰，其犧牲絕不較所羅門之役為　，然戰　巳由南太平洋而移至南太平洋中部。此巳暗示今後日，美艦隊特正式展開決戰，屆時日本海軍必能充分發揮其無敵海軍之眞價也。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日海軍航空部隊，對於進攻吉爾貝特羣島之美軍機動部隊，施以猛攻，獲得赫戰果，是役日指揮官機對準敵大型航空母艦發射必中之魚雷後，更與敵艦相撞壯烈自炸，按駕駛該指揮機者，一為宮前信巳大尉，一為秋山義秋大尉，常本月廿一日薄暮，美軍大型航空母艦出現於　金，泰拉哇島方面海域時，宮前大尉機即對準該艦發射魚雷，當即命中，同昨即馳愛機突入該艦，在該艦右方壯烈自炸，該航空母艦命中魚雷數處，艦尾着火燃燒，頓發生大爆炸，右艦後部側面傾斜，極有沉沒之可能，又秋山特務大尉所駕飛機，亦發射魚雷命中另一艘航空母艦，旋印述機突入該艦之艦橋後方，使該艦遭遇重創，宮前秋山兩大尉之滅敵偉大精神，可謂日人之傳統海軍魂之實踐者，名垂戰史也。</p>

<p>馬尼剌二十二日中央社電　菲律賓獨立後，即積極推進國內諸般產業經濟政策，菲農商部長亞爾蘭頃接見記者，就經濟方面各項問題分別作答如次：問，生活必需物資之增產對策如何？答，政府現為謀增產生活必需物資，巳決定着手擬具工商兩業增產上所必要之各項計劃，茲列舉大要說明如下第一為食糧增產五年計劃，此計劃早於軍政實施下着手，現在巳交由於政府繼續推進。第二為努力從事一般農業，水產業，林業，落牧業等之增產。此外並擬擴充及整飭製造業，家庭手工業之合埋增產態勢。第三為解決推進此等政策基礎之價格問題及增設農事試騐塲，此亦已着手推仃，此外並擬增產食　及生活必需物資，俾達成菲律賓經濟自給之目的。問，增產食糧之具體方策？答政府巳樹立增產食糧五年計劃，期間為自一九四三年至一九四七年，以玉蜀黍為主，共次為　類，野菜類等，米一項預定於五年增產計劃完成後，可增產六千四百萬包其關於增產之方法，係擴張耕地面積，政良灌溉排水之設備，配給農民種子等工作，預定建設灌溉公司二十一處，其經費達二百萬比索。問，政府之織維增產對策如何？答除繼續實施前於軍政時期決定之棉花及絲之增產計劃外並決將國立麻織維公司資本金增為二千萬比索，以資從事機製品之增產，目前馬尼剌等地麻袋之生產，巳增至日產二千條之程度，其次為增强機械設備，擬計劃衣類等之生產，並得出產以馬尼剌麻與棉花合製之麻袋，再次為利用其他麻類製成品，更將使家庭工業合理化，製品標準化。</p>

<p>阿根廷京城二十三日中央社電　美國太平洋艦隊司令部二十一日發表，美軍巳在吉爾貝特羣島登陸，從來美國每作新登陸作戰發表，輒動員一切宜傳機關，大肆宣傳，此次發表後，竟不事聲張，有暫取觀望之勞，此與美國太平洋艦隊司令官尼米資日前兩次豪語將在中部太平洋展開大攻勢之言正相映成趣。此次登陸作戰，以地理上之困難，其進展究難逆測，二十一日落衫磯電台向美國軍隊度播中，曾豫料作戰前途之困難，發出發吿謂，泰拉吁與瑪金島皆為小珊瑚島，以少數之兵力即可作强力之防禦，登陸美軍如不迅速掃蕩日軍，將有被殲　之虞，美聯社記者哈伊塔瓦亦於發表登陸之前，預言，中部太平洋攻勢之困難謂，中部太平洋之日軍反攻，此數日中將愈趨激烈。美國海軍專門家曾謂，無論何地，日本不能攻擊前進之美軍則巳，倘一旦其獲得機會，美海軍當以主力艦隊與其一決勝負，日軍主力艦隊仍擁有可怖之威力，此與美軍之威脅甚大，蓋日艦隊儘可於其限定之水域進攻，而美艦隊則不能不於廣大之水域從事防備云云。美記者此言，其意即在警戒美軍應於實行登睦作戰之時，愼防B艦隊之襲擊，以免再蹈波根維爾島海面之覆轍。</p>

<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　德軍當局二十二日下午宣稱：愛琴海杜特坎尼斯羣島中薩摩島（Samos　Is．）之英軍，及巴桔里奥軍巳投降，德軍巳佔據該島重要軍事設施。按薩摩島而積一百八十方哩，位於尼加里亞島之束北。</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：自薩摩島陷落後，德軍在愛琴海中之地位，更形鞏固，此事對於英美在地中海之地位，具有深遠之影響。英美巳陷入政治之僵局，其唯一之出路為軍事之解救行動，尤其在義大利戰塲。敵軍於星期日再度擬以局部之軍事行動，挽回其在杜特坎尼斯羣島之敗績，但結果仍歸失敗。此種有限之活動，必為反軸心軍事判斷上之失策，殆無疑義。蓋克拉克將軍與蒙高茂萊將軍均深知義境惡劣之天氣，使重砲無法運用，且阻碍共全部供應品與援軍，此外，彼等對於德軍陣地之無法攻破，亦所深知，蓋英美軍曾向德陣地轟攻多時，而終未得逞。</p>

<p>柏林廿三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：昨晚英機大舉襲此間，城內多區受損頗鉅，尤以工人住宅區為甚，民衆亦蒙受損失，無法恢復之文化紀念建築物有被炸毀者，數中立國外交代表駐在所亦被波及而蒙受損害。</p>
<h3 id="c19">莫斯科會談後的　巴爾幹局勢 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>據挪威沮利希新聞報的倫教電訊，英蘇二國關於巴爾幹問題最近又發生新的政治糾紛。這據說是由於從新的角度檢討莫斯科會談的內容所致，而其眞相乃水落石出。蓋會談終了後，英美各報關於蘇聯的企圖散佈樂觀論，而之後陸續發生的諸事件，又與莫斯科共同會談所表示的大異其趣。第一是波蘭問題，據沮利希新聞報稱，蘇聯政府和倫敦的波蘭亡命政府間的緊張，並未緩和。</p>
<p>這和莫斯科會談前英美方面散佈蘇聯和波關間的外交關係即將重開之說，顯然不符。</p>
<p>第二是南斯拉夫及希臘問題。</p>
<p>英外相艾登最近在開羅會見前南斯拉夫國王彼得及其首相，並希臘亡命國王蓋奥奇奥斯及共首相，到今日為止，莫斯科會談中，是否曾討論巴爾榦問題，不得而知，但倫敦的外交方面，相信南斯拉夫亡命政權和希臘亡命政權之間，存在着某種桔別緊張的狀態。</p>
<p>希臘的兩黨派</p>
<p>希臘現在個主要黨派團體存在着，共一稱為愛台斯團，是共和主義而取幾分左翼的政策，其二是愛拉斯團，共產主義的色彩極為濃厚。愛台斯團在以前英美方面視為是右翼團體，但實際上則是左翼的共和主義派，在地方性的問題上：和愛拉斯團也不一致。</p>
<p>希臘的王黨派和右翼諸政黨，幾沒有人支持這是深堪玩味的。且這事實又表示英美方面所計劃的用王制來重建希臘的方案，根本上失去其基礎，愛合斯團以前本有王制派的傾向，而為英美信賴，現在却正在逐漸變成反王制派的團體，大可注目。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫內幕</p>
<p>南斯拉夫也有類似的變化。英政府鑑於前南斯拉夫遭遇和希臘同樣的內部新情勢，最近乃不能不變更對前南斯拉夫的政策，英政府巳放逐一向支持的黨派團長密哈洛維區，幷放棄支持該團的政策。英美對前南斯拉夫也巳失却了用戰前的組織實行再建政策之實質的基礎。</p>
<p>關於此點，中立的消息靈通方面，也以特別的興味注視法國民族解放委員會之最近發展。英美的寵兒季勞，恰因和希臘及南斯拉夫同樣的理由，而失墜其勢力。</p>
<p>英美外交對地中海諸國正在失却其地盤，而蘇聯則利用這情勢，支持向這方向發展，正是絕妙的對照。英外相艾登和土外長曼奈門卓格魯在開羅會談，是否涉及土耳其的參戰問題，或單報莫斯科三國會談的情形告訴土耳其。姑作別論，英國對開羅會談的企圖，無疑的，鑒於蘇聯外交對這地中海諸國的積極性，擬欲從新確立英國對巴爾幹</p>
<p>英國有這種企圖，從艾登在開羅和土外長，前南斯拉夫及希臘亡命政權首腦者會見一事上可以知道。但這些亡命政權首腦者，和本國實際的游擊運動隔閡，所以英國砍通過這幾個亡命政權而恢復戰前的組織早巳不合實情。因此，英國和土耳其及前南斯拉夫，希臘諸政治家的會談，可視為英國的焦燥之進一步的表現。（翔：譯自一月十三日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>虹口，橫浜橋南首，東寶興路二百七十一號，「老上海」或是上海老基督徒，也許還記得那裏有1座軒昻進壯的基督敎懷恩堂吧？那是一所建築得極其攷究而且環境又特別幽雅的大廈，枯紅色的挿入雲霄一般的古屋，下面　着矮矮的圍　，一對別墅式的大門上，現在掛着一塊日本人邸第門口特殊點綴品一般的木牌子，標明是「上海盲　學校」。</p>
<p>按門鈴，一位和藹的老婆婆開門，「啊！是中國先生，來參觀的嗎？得請示東洋先生呢！」</p>
<p>越過石板院子，靠右手聳立的大厦裏。出來一位日統女敎師，她熱心地帶領到各部分去參觀。一會兒，中國籍敎師洪宗元君下了課，比較可以　違地　到該校的一切。</p>
<p>前身是老靶子路五六六羿的「上海育學校」，因為事業據展·增收啞生，才改稱「上海盲啞學校」。專收盲啞少年及靑年男女學生，授以國民學識及醫療學府要，以造就鍼治·灸治·按摩·推拿醫　人員為宗旨。</p>
<p>學校的編制</p>
<p>上海盲啞學校的編制，規定修業年限，初年級一年，中等科二，一　成科一年，研究科年年，所謂連成科，包括　治，點灸·按摩及摩擦治療等科目·研究科則以「點字」（即盲人文字）之研究　主、每年分為兩學期，與普通學校相同。</p>
<p>盲啞教育的科目，主要的是　身·日語·歷史，地理·算術．理　·體操·唱歌·病呱·解剖·衛生·生理·　治。點灸·摩擦治療·　摩等等。</p>
<p>入學年齡，規定初等科學生為十五歲，中等科學生為二十五歲，凡有初等科畢業或其他學校同等學力的，也可以挿班，速成科學生規定為三十五歲·並得自由神班，上課的時間，規定為每天上午九時至下午三時。凡欲報名學生，祗須繳報名費一　及證明文件，送交該校招生委員會，如認為合格，即可入學。</p>
<p>從規模編制與敎育辦法來看，上海盲啞學校不失為今日上海盲啞人難得的學府。</p>
<p>緊張的敎學</p>
<p>琴聲悠　在這高大的古　中，十字架的掛圖下，盲目的學生，跟着盲目敎師水谷議洽氏在練唱基督的聖詩、那聲良　　到校外、彷彿是數十百人在祈禱讚美，那知只有五個小學生呢！先生說，這是種子、不久希望眞有數十數百貧苦無吿的窮孩子同來讚美基督精　的最後成功。</p>
<p>文科的敎室裏，華籍敎師洪宗元氏正在提高嗓子，用比較準確的國語在講授，盲目的學生，從十歲上下至三十多歲的，都在　筆抄錄，用的是特殊的鐵筆和　紙，抄下的是點字。師生全神貫注地在敎學，敎室內是那麽緊張·然而走出敎室、　上門、又是那麽經謐，像是從未有人跡的古　！</p>
<p>縱使是中國學生、語也　最主要的課目，所用的日語課本，也是特製的「點字」本，這種日本語的「點字」，計有淸音字母點半五十個，濁音字母點字二十五字，抝音拼音點字三十餘個，其餘長音，促音，樑點符號，外國字符、數符，阿拉伯數字等，共計一百三十個基本字母。熟諳了這種字母的拼機之後，即可利用聽覺紀錄語首講辭，並可利用觸　誦　課本，書報雜誌。日本出版的盲人用書報確實不少，主要的有須古淸氏繼輯由每日新聞社發行的「點字每日J，每逢星期四出版一份，每份約為十六開本十頁，巳經有一千一百數十號的歷史，該校也可經常收到，為盲生的主要精神食糧。</p>
<p>為着增進盲啞敎育的效能，職員室裏還有幾　有關盲啞敎育的圖書，形成簡單的閱覽室，如果經費充實些，能夠稍加擴充，對於盲啞師生也許更有實　助益吧！</p>

<h3 id="c43">戰後幣制問題 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>最近銀行通報　論大談「前次歐戰德國通貨之膨脹與　理」，揆其用意，好像是在乎借題發揮，促起國人對於我國戰後幣制整理問題的注意。本攔也願乘此機會來參加此種討論。</p>
<p>本來現在戰事未了。幣制整理，根木無從說起。但是凡布「預則立，不預則廢」。吾人對於戰後幣制的整理問題，自應在戰事尙未結束之秋。先下一番研究功夫。以為未雨綢繆之計。</p>
<p>戰後幣制整理，西洋各國不乏先例，稍遠的則有十九世紀中葉以後美國南北戰爭後的幣制整理，戰後七八年即恢復戰前的幣制，使　權人及長期儲蓄存戶毫無損失；稍近的則有上次歐戰後　英國之恢復　金本位，使債權人及長期儲戶均不吃虧，　法國之貶値恢復新金本位，使債權人及長期儲戶同吃其虧，　德國之取消舊紙幣採行新金本位。使債權人及長期儲戶大吃其虧。</p>
<p>我國戰後幣制整理的方針，理想起來，自然也不出上述四個舉例中之一·可是，不談戰後幣制問題則巳，否則所謂貶値政策或維持舊幣政策，都要一一加以研究，挈長補短，製為最合理想的方案，而以引起人民對於通貨之信心，為其惟1關鍵，由此可以獲得安定民心，抑平物價的結果·吾人以為一個强有力而愛民的中央政府，是一定有能力，有方法，來製訂並且實行戰後幣制整理政策的·因為今日世界各國每喜侈談戰後復興計劃，所以我們桔地提出戰後幣制間題。</p>

<h3 id="c51">代論　（自第一版轉來） <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>然而，我在上次論文裏已經淸楚地指出，如萬一德意失敗，那末阻擋蘇聯勢力侵入歐洲的圍墻就完全沒有了。同時這就是說，抑制歐洲大陸的自由主義和共產主義之壓力，突然消滅了。在法西斯主義消逝後的歐洲，其政治上的「眞空」形勢，將由什麽來塡補呢？一向因德意兩國的政權存在，而才費了九牛二虎之力鎭壓下去的歐洲自由主義和共產主義，當時誰都可以想像得到，將像雨後春筍，突飛猛進地發展起來，尤其是戰後民衆的貧困狀態，將賜與共產主義一個最好的發展地盤，這一點，就是參照一下上次世界大戰後的情形，也可以瞭如指掌。上次世界大戰的時候，並沒有共產主義的龐大根據地。然而此次，却已有了一個世界國家形式的共產主義蘇聯。假如德意的圍墻總崩清後，蘇聯乘戰勝之威，侵入戰後的歐洲，那末結果如何，是不言而喩的。在那種情形上，英美能够代替德意防止得住共產主義侵入歐洲麽？三國會議的結果，蘇聯與英美間行到了「妥協」，所以蘇聯對西方也許不想染指麼？然而今日的問題，並不單是蘇聯想不想的問題，而是整個歐洲共產主義的勃興問題。目前在歐洲進行着的空前驚人之巨大消耗戰，將來所造成的貧困，決不止於德意兩國的貧困。德國現在業巳把整個歐洲，改組成了一個以德國為中心的偉大生產組織（也包括以德國為中心的偉大政治機構）。所以退一步說，假如像重慶方面所作的「甜蜜的夢」一樣，在這一年內德國解體，那末當然，整個歐洲的生產機構（也包括整個歐洲的政治機構）也就隨而形體。這樣結果，誰都會想像得到，整個歐洲，將碰到前所未　的經濟混亂興貧困現象。如想到這種貧困現象。就會被一向未能抬起頭來的德國，意大利，法國，西班牙，匈牙利，波蘭等地方的共產主義者所利用，那末那時的歐洲政治形勢將如何？這一問題，即使低能兒也能想像得到。然而在那時，英美仍然與日本，進行着大規模的消耗戰，英美無論怎樣翻天覆地，也不能拯救歐洲的經濟貧困。何况英美，尤其何况英國的民衆自身，也都苦惱於不知伊於胡底的經濟貧困裏呢！因此，歐洲共產主義的浪潮，恐怕也將激起英美國內的共產主義運動，尤其是將激起英國國內的共產主義運動，那末也就大有可能威脅到目前正在進行戰爭的英美統治階級之地位。旣然如此，那末英美解決歐洲問題後，即從歐洲抽出手來，用全副精神對付大東亞戰綫，而發動大攻勢，擊潰日本，然後把「最後勝利」雙手獻給重慶，他們道種「甜蜜的夢」，是不能不令人發生莫大懷疑的。</p>
<p>這種危險，當然重慶以及英美的政治家，也會預想得到。正因為這種原因，他們才在十月十九日至三十日莫斯科，召開三國會議。這個會議，他們聲明說「圓滿」畢會。他們在大吹大摺著說，戰爭結束後，關於歐洲問題，蘇聯誓與英美合作。然而這決不是說，德國崩潰後，史太林誓與英美共同鎭壓歐洲各國的共產黨活動。史太林在三國會議閉幕後，不久所舉行的蘇聯二十六屆＋月革命紀念日那天的演說中，會說過：「歐洲各國，如法國，比利時，南斯拉夫，波蘭，希臘等，由希特勒的手掌中解放後，各國人民，自由決定其政體」。在道種情形下，人民的政體自決權是什麽意思？假如人民喜歡希特勒政權，那末是否會允許人民自由決定這樣的政體呢？顯然是不會的。史太林很淸楚地早巳預想得到，那個時候歐洲人民所「自由決定」的政體，是怎樣一種類型的。正因為這個原故，他才這樣聲明。等待各個國家內革命條件成熟，這就是史太林始終不變的一貫方針。雖然托洛斯基會向世界各國輸出蘇聯造的革命，然而史太林却像以前會見H·G·威爾斯時所明白表示的一樣，決採取「不向國外輸出革命」的這種方針。三國會議時的蘇聯態度，已足够證明它對戰後歐洲的政治情形，即對共產主義革命條件的成熱情形，具有絕大的自信·正如十一月二日德國外交部所聲明的一樣，三國會議：「是蘇聯在歐洲的勝利，英美的失敗，不外是全部歐洲將屈服於布爾塞維克主義而巳」。雖然英美和重慶都知道布爾塞維克主義的危險，但他們却不得不以蘇聯的聲明作飲鴆止渴之計，這是證明迫切的情形使然。這正如鴉片擁者，雖然明知吸鴉片就要死，但却不能不仍然繼續吸，是一樣的道理。而這種病症最顯著者，當然要算他們所說的「世界四大强國」中最脆弱的一環重慶政府囉。</p>
<p>史太林在同一個演說中還說過。「去年東綫上的軸心軍隊為二百四十師，其中德國軍隊為一百七十九師，但今年却為二百五十七師，其中德軍竟達二百零七師」。這顯然是暗射英美的無力。看了這一點也就可以明白，假如在歐洲德國失敗的那一天，蘇聯會向全世界聲明自己的立塲—戰敗德國者是我·蘇聯對世界上的威勢，立刻就會直接影饗到各國共產黨勢力的發展。尤其是與蘇聯國境相連，且具有僅次於蘇聯共產黨的龐大共產黨之抗戰中國，其政治影響一定會更大。在那個時候，重慶政權的命運將如何？這無論如何都是蔣介石氏必須再三加以考慮的問題。但道個問題的回答，當然並不是在腦海裏尋找，而必須在國共合作的經過尋找。（季譯）（本節完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Fate of Chongqing (Part 1) – The Inevitability of the Kuomintang Split in Chongqing <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>One day, Iemitsu Tokugawa, the third Shogun of the Tokugawa dynasty, visited the temple of the famous monk Takuan. At that time, pointing to a ship sailing on the sea, he asked the two Zen monks: Is there a way to stop that ship immediately? One Zen monk immediately left his seat and quietly closed the paper sliding door in front of him; the other Zen monk remained seated, with his eyes closed. It is said that this was the famous answer given by Zen Buddhism to Iemitsu at that time. If everything is but a reflection of human thought, then stopping the thought of the ship sailing naturally means that the real ship has stopped sailing! Indeed, for absolute idealists, the cessation of all thought means the disappearance of all things. However, from a zoological point of view, the attitude of these two Zen monks is somewhat similar to that of the ostrich in the great African desert. It is said that when ostriches are chased by enemies and have nowhere to escape, they bury their heads in the sand. Let us briefly analyze the psychological effect of the ostrich; perhaps it thinks that if it cannot see the enemy, then the enemy is already gone. Nowadays, there are countless people who behave like ostriches, especially among those engaged in political work. I believe that Chiang Kai-shek, who recently wrote the book "China's Destiny," can also be classified as a human ostrich. What is the reason for this? In a nutshell, this book deliberately avoids discussing the biggest current problem facing the Kuomintang in Chongqing today – whether to compromise with Japan or hand over political power to the Chinese Communist Party – a choice between two options, one of which must be taken. Instead, it buries its head in the sand of the fantasy of the final victory of the war of resistance, seeking to avoid seeing the danger of the Kuomintang split that exists in the current reality. The reality that is developing inside and outside China, whether he is subjectively aware of it or not, the dangerous demon is still striding forward. Here, we analyze the current reality of China and point out the inevitability of danger, which may be of some help even to Chiang Kai-shek (or to those who are truly concerned about the fate of China)!</p>
<p>Reply to Optimists</p>
<p>In my article "Reply to Pessimists" in the Shanghai Shen Bao Weekly Review on October 24th, I said: "Since the surrender of Badoglio and the retreat of Germany on the Eastern Front, it must be admitted that pessimism is developing among some Chinese people. For example, they are beginning to suspect that Germany will soon follow the same fate as Italy! If this becomes a reality, then Japan and the Nanjing government, located in the Greater East Asia region, will encounter unprecedented difficulties!" This pessimism in Shanghai is optimism from the perspective of Chongqing. It seems that Chongqing believes that the European problem will definitely be resolved this year. If the United Kingdom and the United States resolve the European problem, then, of course, as Roosevelt and Churchill said, they will use the full fighting power of the world's two major capitalist countries to strike Japan. Then Japan will definitely not be able to withstand this blow and will collapse! According to those who hold this view, the so-called "final victory of the War of Resistance" will, within this year, be brought to Chongqing by the power of the United Kingdom and the United States. In other words, Chongqing only needs to open its arms and wait for the development of the world situation.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Fierce Battle on Gilbert Islands Sinks Seven American Ships; Two Japanese Lieutenants Practice the Spirit of the Navy <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 23rd: Fierce battles are still underway in the Gilbert Islands area, especially on Tarawa Island, where intense fighting is taking place around the landing points. Since the 19th, the results achieved by our naval air force and ground forces are as follows: The naval air force has sunk one enemy medium-sized aircraft carrier and one destroyer, and damaged two enemy large-sized aircraft carriers (one of which was severely damaged or may have sunk), one medium-sized aircraft carrier (severely damaged or may have sunk), one battleship (or cruiser) (severely damaged and on fire), and one transport ship (severely damaged and on fire). Thirty-six enemy aircraft were shot down (including three unconfirmed). The ground forces shot down eighty-nine enemy aircraft (including twenty-two unconfirmed). A total of fifteen of our aircraft were self-detonated or did not return to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to military experts here: The Gilbert Islands are adjacent to the Japanese-controlled Marshall Islands and are strategically important. The U.S. military's operations in the Gilbert Islands are like stealing at someone else's doorstep. Entering the South Seas area is the strategic zone of the Japanese Navy, which is also the zone of absolute development of Japan's national power. It is expected that the sacrifices of the U.S. military in this area will be no less than those in the Solomon Islands campaign. The war has shifted from the South Pacific to the central South Pacific. This has already hinted that in the future, the Japanese and U.S. fleets will officially engage in decisive battles. At that time, the Japanese Navy will be able to fully demonstrate the true value of its invincible navy.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese naval air force launched a fierce attack on the U.S. military mobile force attacking the Gilbert Islands and achieved remarkable results. In this battle, the Japanese commander's aircraft, after aiming a torpedo that was guaranteed to hit at a large enemy aircraft carrier, collided with the enemy ship in a heroic self-detonation. According to reports, the pilots of the commander's aircraft were Lieutenant Nobumiya Miyamae and Lieutenant Yoshiaki Akiyama. On the evening of the 21st of this month, when a large U.S. aircraft carrier appeared in the sea area near Betio and Tarawa Island, Lieutenant Miyamae's aircraft immediately aimed a torpedo at the ship, which hit immediately. Then, he drove his beloved aircraft into the ship and heroically self-detonated on the right side of the ship. The aircraft carrier was hit by several torpedoes, and the stern caught fire and burned, causing a huge explosion. The rear side of the right ship tilted, and there was a high possibility of it sinking. In addition, the aircraft piloted by Lieutenant Yoshiaki Akiyama also launched a torpedo that hit another aircraft carrier, and then dived into the ship's bridge, causing the ship to suffer severe damage. The great spirit of Lieutenant Miyamae and Lieutenant Akiyama in destroying the enemy can be said to be the practitioners of the traditional Japanese naval soul, and their names will be immortalized in war history.</p>

<p>Manila, 22nd (Central News Agency) – After Philippine independence, the country is actively promoting various domestic industrial and economic policies. Philippine Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Alran recently met with reporters and answered various economic questions as follows: Question: What are the countermeasures for increasing the production of essential goods? Answer: In order to increase the production of essential goods, the government has decided to start drafting various plans necessary for increasing production in both industry and commerce. The main points are listed and explained as follows: First, a five-year food production plan. This plan was started under military administration and is now being continued by the government. Second, efforts will be made to increase the production of general agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and animal husbandry. In addition, it is planned to expand and rectify the rational production status of manufacturing and household handicrafts. Third, to solve the price problem, which is the basis for promoting these policies, and to increase the number of agricultural experimental fields, which has also been started. In addition, it is planned to increase the production of salt and essential goods in order to achieve the goal of Philippine economic self-sufficiency. Question: What are the specific measures for increasing food production? Answer: The government has established a five-year food production plan, from 1943 to 1947, with corn as the main crop, followed by legumes, vegetables, etc. It is estimated that rice production will increase by 64 million bags after the completion of the five-year production plan. The methods for increasing production include expanding the area of cultivated land, improving irrigation and drainage facilities, and distributing seeds to farmers. It is planned to build 21 irrigation companies with a budget of 2 million pesos. Question: What are the government's measures for increasing the production of textiles? Answer: In addition to continuing the cotton and silk production plans decided during the military administration period, it has also been decided to increase the capital of the National Manila Hemp Textile Company to 20 million pesos in order to increase the production of machine-made products. Currently, the production of sacks in Manila and other places has increased to a level of 2,000 per day. Second, to enhance mechanical equipment, it is planned to produce clothing and other items, and to produce sacks made of Manila hemp and cotton. Third, to utilize other hemp products, and to rationalize and standardize household industries.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The U.S. Pacific Fleet Command announced on the 21st that the U.S. military had landed in the Gilbert Islands. In the past, whenever the U.S. launched a new landing operation, it mobilized all propaganda agencies to publicize it extensively. This time, after the announcement, it did not make any publicity and took a wait-and-see attitude. This is in sharp contrast to the remarks made twice by Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, that a major offensive would be launched in the central Pacific. Due to the geographical difficulties of this landing operation, it is difficult to predict its progress. On the 21st, a radio station in Los Angeles, broadcasting to the U.S. military, predicted the difficulties of the future of the battle and issued a warning that Tarawa and Makin Islands are both small coral islands that can be strongly defended with a small number of troops. If the landing U.S. military does not quickly eliminate the Japanese army, there is a risk of being annihilated. Associated Press reporter Haitaawa also predicted before the landing that the difficulties of the central Pacific offensive would increase in the next few days due to the fierce Japanese counterattacks in the central Pacific. A U.S. naval expert said that no matter where, if Japan cannot attack the advancing U.S. military, once it gets the opportunity, the U.S. Navy should fight a decisive battle with its main fleet. The Japanese main fleet still has a terrible power, which poses a great threat to the U.S. military because the Japanese fleet can attack in its limited waters, while the U.S. fleet has to defend in a wide area. The intention of the U.S. reporter is to warn the U.S. military to be careful of attacks by the B fleet when implementing the landing operation, so as to avoid repeating the mistakes made on the surface of Bougainville Island.</p>

<p>Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency) – After arriving in Manila on the 22nd, Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, attended a welcoming banquet hosted by President Laurel and delivered a speech on the spot. The main points are as follows: British imperialism is about to collapse, and American imperialism is trying to replace it. Today, countries around the world must either maintain this imperialism or build a new order based on justice. In the past, some Asian nations relied on the United States, but now they feel the serious threat of American colonial policy. I always oppose the oppression of the enemy and continue to fight. Individuals are not important and must die sooner or later. We must strive for the eternal life of our countries.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The national land improvement project to be launched in Japan this winter is a major part of the second food production increase plan, so all parties have high expectations for its results. The area to be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce this time is about 1.6 million hectares, which is a very large scale. In order to carefully implement the plan, it has been reviewed many times, and recently the implementation plan has been completely decided. It is estimated that the total cost of the land improvement project will be 420 million yen. According to this estimate, it can increase the harvest of 2,178,700 koku of rice and 1,217,800 koku of wheat by the end of Showa 20 (1945). In addition, regarding a part of the labor force required for land improvement, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce has obtained the cooperation of the Ministry of Education and has decided to mobilize students to participate. After active discussions, the plan has been approved, and on the 22nd, the "Essential Guidelines for Mobilizing Students to Complete Land Improvement" was announced to local governors across the country. It is planned to mobilize 18 million people (cumulative number) during the five months from November to March next year. The main points of the outline are as follows: The labor force required for land improvement is a total of 180 million people, of which students will be responsible for one-tenth, which is 18 million people, that is, it is planned to mobilize 600,000 people to work for 30 days. The students to be mobilized are schoolchildren in the fourth grade and above of national primary schools, as well as students of youth schools, normal schools, higher vocational schools, and universities. Considering the particularity of industrial school students, it is planned to mobilize them for 20 days. When implementing the mobilization of students, close contact should be made with the agricultural production patriotic promotion team, the food production increase team, and the Manchurian Pioneer Youth Volunteer Team to contribute to the promotion of the national movement. Regarding the mobilization plan, it will end in March next year, and plans for April and May will be established separately.</p>

<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – German authorities announced on the afternoon of the 22nd that the British forces and Badoglio's troops on Samos Island in the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea had surrendered, and German forces had occupied the island's important military facilities. Samos Island has an area of 180 square miles and is located northeast of Nikaria Island.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Since the fall of Samos Island, Germany's position in the Aegean Sea has become more consolidated, which has a far-reaching impact on the position of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Mediterranean Sea. The United Kingdom and the United States have fallen into a political deadlock, and their only way out is military salvation, especially on the Italian battlefield. On Sunday, the enemy forces again attempted to regain their defeat in the Dodecanese Islands with limited military actions, but the result was still a failure. There is no doubt that this limited activity must be a misjudgment in the anti-Axis military. General Clark and General Montgomery are well aware that the harsh weather in Italy makes it impossible to use heavy artillery and hinders the supply of all supplies and reinforcements. In addition, they are also well aware that the German positions cannot be broken, as the British and American forces have bombarded the German positions for a long time without success.</p>
<p>The Soft Underbelly of Europe Turns Tough</p>
<p>On this point, there is one more thing that is quite interesting, that is, most of the captured British and American soldiers say that "the soft underbelly of Europe is very hard." Each time General Eisenhower's troops attempted to attack Mount Sampugaro and Mount Corno with a squadron, but they all failed under the artillery fire of the German outposts. In western Italy, the activities of the U.S. military are limited to artillery, but German artillery and mortars destroyed seven enemy gun emplacements. In the central area of the Apennine Mountains, German outposts repelled the British reconnaissance team's sudden attack without much effort, while a strong U.S. reconnaissance team was blocked in the mountainous area of Castel del Sangro and was repelled in a counterattack. The British Eighth Army attempted to enter the flooded area of the Sangro River, but was blocked by German heavy artillery. A German reconnaissance team engaged the reassembled British forces east of the Sangro River and captured several prisoners of war. The actions of the British army in the past few days have been constantly limited by the bad weather and difficult terrain.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Japanese Army Attacks Changde; Yu Army in the Lishui Area Suffers Annihilation Blow <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Yu Military Commission announced on the 22nd the battle situation in the area west of Dongting Lake in Hunan Province as follows: The Japanese army attacked Changde from the north and northwest on the 20th and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Yu army outside the city. The Japanese air force and artillery units are also covering their ground forces, bombing Changde extensively. Another part of the Japanese army is detouring east of Changde to attack the transportation hub from Changde to Changsha. In addition, the Japanese army in the south of Cili is also launching a fierce attack on the Yu army with strong artillery and mobile units.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army broke through the Yu army positions along the Lishui River. The Yu army's counterattack was also very fierce, and reserve troops were transferred from the rear positions in an attempt to stop the Japanese army from advancing south. However, it was too late. Most of the Yu army fell under the encirclement of the Japanese army and suffered an annihilation blow. The main force of the 74th Army, a direct line unit of the Yu army, moved north from the defense line along the Yuanjiang River in an attempt to stop the Japanese army's fierce attack. Its main force, the 51st Division and the 58th Division, had advanced to the triangular area near Leiyuyan (20 kilometers south of Cili) since the 19th, but was encircled by the Japanese army. The Japanese army launched a major annihilation battle starting on the 19th. Furthermore, because the Japanese army's advance units suddenly reached the Longtan River, the Yu army's retreat was cut off, so it had collapsed by the 21st. The Japanese army advancing south from the Linfeng area attacked the 166th Division of the 44th Yu Army at Qijiahe (47 kilometers southwest of Linfeng) and the 100th Yu Central Direct Line Army from the area east of Changsha from the front, completely annihilating them. It has now completed the posture of approaching Taoyuan, an important stronghold of the Yu army. In addition, the Japanese army advancing southwest of Linli is advancing like a hot knife through butter. It had advanced to Zuoshi on the night of the 20th, and Changde, the main stronghold of the Sixth War Zone of the Yu army, will fall soon.</p>
<p>Yu Army on the Yuehan Line Suffers a Defeat</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base on the Huaizhong front line, the 133rd Yu Army took advantage of the Japanese army's operations west of Dongting Lake and began to move restlessly on the Yuehan Line. The Japanese army launched a surprise attack on its source, Hengxi, at dawn on the 20th and completely annihilated it. The Japanese army began to attack the 133rd Yu Army entrenched in the area near Bailifan at 3:30 AM on the 20th, annihilating it. It then pursued the defeated army and entered Hengxi at 10:30 AM, occupying the area. Another unit of the Japanese army also launched an attack on the reinforcement unit of the 133rd Yu Army with four mortars southwest of Hengxi at 6:30 AM on the same morning. After about five hours of battle, it was defeated and attacked Mapu, occupying it. In this battle, 800 Yu soldiers were killed and a large number of war spoils were seized. The Yu army's attempt to move restlessly has been completely crushed.</p>

<h3 id="e18">British Planes Bomb Berlin in Night Raid <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: British planes launched a large-scale raid on Berlin last night, causing significant damage to many areas of the city, especially working-class residential areas. Civilians also suffered losses, and some irreplaceable cultural monuments were destroyed. The residences of diplomatic representatives from several neutral countries were also affected and damaged.</p>
<h3 id="e19">The Balkan Situation After the Moscow Talks <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>According to a London dispatch from the Norwegian Zurich Newspaper, new political disputes have recently arisen between Britain and the Soviet Union regarding the Balkan issue. This is said to be due to a review of the content of the Moscow talks from a new perspective, revealing the true situation. After the talks, the British and American newspapers spread optimistic views about the Soviet Union's intentions, but the events that followed were very different from what was expressed at the Moscow joint talks. The first issue is the Polish question. According to the Zurich Newspaper, the tension between the Soviet government and the Polish government-in-exile in London has not eased.</p>
<p>This is clearly inconsistent with the British and American claims before the Moscow talks that diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland were about to reopen.</p>
<p>The second issue is Yugoslavia and Greece.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Eden recently met with former Yugoslav King Peter and his Prime Minister, as well as Greek King George II and his Prime Minister, in Cairo. To this day, it is unknown whether the Balkan issue was discussed during the Moscow talks, but diplomatic circles in London believe that there is some tension between the Yugoslav government-in-exile and the Greek government-in-exile.</p>
<p>The Two Factions in Greece</p>
<p>There are currently two major political groups in Greece. One is called the EAM, which is republican and takes a somewhat left-wing policy. The other is the ELAS, which has a strong communist flavor. The EAM was previously regarded by the British and Americans as a right-wing group, but in reality, it is a left-wing republican faction that also disagrees with the ELAS on local issues.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that there is almost no support for the royalists and right-wing parties in Greece. This fact also indicates that the British and American plan to rebuild Greece using a monarchy is fundamentally losing its foundation. The EAM, which previously had a pro-monarchist tendency and was trusted by the British and Americans, is now gradually becoming an anti-monarchist group, which is worth noting.</p>
<p>Inside Story of Yugoslavia</p>
<p>Similar changes are taking place in Yugoslavia. In view of the same internal situation in Yugoslavia as in Greece, the British government has recently been forced to change its policy towards former Yugoslavia. The British government has exiled Mihailović, the leader of a party that it has always supported, and has abandoned its policy of supporting that group. Britain and the United States have also lost the substantial basis for implementing a reconstruction policy in former Yugoslavia using pre-war organizations.</p>
<p>In this regard, neutral sources are also paying particular attention to the recent developments in the French Committee of National Liberation. Giraud, the darling of the British and Americans, has lost his influence for the same reasons as in Greece and Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>British and American diplomacy is losing its ground in the Mediterranean countries, while the Soviet Union is taking advantage of this situation to support developments in that direction, which is a perfect contrast. Whether British Foreign Secretary Eden's talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu in Cairo involved the issue of Turkey's participation in the war, or simply informed Turkey of the situation of the Moscow Tripartite Talks, is another matter. Undoubtedly, Britain's intention in the Cairo talks was to re-establish Britain's position in the Balkans in view of the Soviet Union's active diplomacy in the Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p>Britain has this intention, as can be seen from Eden's meetings in Cairo with the Turkish Foreign Minister and the heads of the former Yugoslav and Greek governments-in-exile. However, these heads of government-in-exile are isolated from the actual guerrilla movements in their countries, so it is no longer realistic for Britain to restore the pre-war organization through these few governments-in-exile. Therefore, the British talks with Turkish and former Yugoslav and Greek politicians can be seen as a further manifestation of British anxiety.

<h3 id="e21">German Air Force Active in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, Difficult for Anti-Axis Forces to Transport <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – German military authorities announced: On the afternoon of the 21st, the German Air Force attacked an anti-Axis convoy in the Atlantic, heavily damaging two large transport ships of 10,000 and 8,000 tons, escorted by cruisers, destroyers, and other warships. The two ships appeared to have sunk. In addition, three other ships, totaling 15,000 tons, were damaged. One German plane was lost in the operation.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency has learned from military authorities that enemy troops and documents captured in southern Italy consistently confirm that the German Air Force's bombing of enemy convoys in the Mediterranean Sea and facilities in the port of Naples in the past few weeks has been extremely effective. American prisoners of war have testified that at least thirty-six ships, fully loaded with troops and supplies, were sunk on the route from Gibraltar to Bizerte in the first half of November. The difficulties currently faced by Generals Clark and Montgomery's troops are due to the fact that the Anglo-American forces are unable to obtain sufficient supplies due to the German aircraft's attacks on convoys. For example, in mid-November, the US Fifth Army needed several divisions to replace the heavy casualties suffered in the Salerno area. These reinforcements were sent to the Italian front by transport ships. However, on the evening of November 6th, they were attacked by a strong German air force off the coast of North Africa, so very few ships arrived in Italy. According to eyewitnesses, seven transport ships were sunk. The troops on board drifted at sea without rescue, while other ships scattered and fled to avoid disaster.</p>

<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: The German army launched a defensive battle in the Dnieper bend, achieving great results on the 21st.

The German army's counterattack in the Kiev area is progressing smoothly. The Soviet army on the central front continued to attack the city of Orsha for the past week, stopping only on the 21st. In the Gomel area, the Soviet army attempted to break through the German defenses with reinforcements of tanks and infantry, forming only a few salients in local areas.

<h3 id="e32">The New Union Screened the Film "Bloody Battle in the South Sea" Yesterday; Reporting Director Matsushima Gave a Speech <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: This year's December 8th marks the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. The Shanghai News Union specially pre-celebrated the event with three programs: A film screening was held yesterday (the 23rd) at 3:30 PM on the eighth floor of the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road, featuring the film "Bloody Battle in the South Sea," newly obtained from the enemy lines, as well as the Shochiku film "Young Flying General" and the newsreel "Japanese Students Enlisting to Serve the Nation." The union specially invited Director Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Reporting Department to give a speech. Many people from various circles in Shanghai, both Chinese and Japanese, attended enthusiastically, creating a lively atmosphere. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Occasion of the Film Screening</p>
<p>Attendees included Zhang Yipeng, Chen Dongbai, Zhang Chao, Wan Xuefang, Jin Zongcheng, Chen Zhengzhang, etc., as well as cadres from the Shanghai Magazine Union's Civic Thrift Movement and reporters from various newspapers in the city. Allied guests included Director Matsushima of the Fleet Reporting Department, Captain Shioda, and Yaji Motora. Xu Liqiu, the union's rotating managing director, represented the union and warmly welcomed the guests, along with Director-General Ren Yunzhu. The ceremony was hosted by Di Ze. Xu Jiabao, the union's rotating managing director, gave a report, stating: Next month, the 8th, marks the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. To commemorate the occasion, the union is holding a film festival today, screening the film "Bloody Battle in the South Sea." This film was not produced by Chinese or Japanese film companies but was shot by enemy military reporters, capturing the naval battle in the South Pacific at the time. The screening today, as the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War approaches, is of great significance. We have specially invited Reporting Director Matsushima to speak about the significance of the film. Then, Fleet Reporting Director Matsushima explained the significance of the film and the current situation of the South Pacific operations. The union's Director-General Ren served as the translator. The film was then screened. In particular, the film "Bloody Battle in the South Sea" vividly depicted the valiant bombing by the Japanese air force and the sinking of the American aircraft carrier Hornet, presenting the scene before their eyes. The film was very valuable. The films "Japanese Students Enlisting to Serve the Nation" and "Young Flying General" further revealed the fervent patriotism of the Japanese people. The event lasted three hours.</p>
<p>Matsushima's Speech</p>
<p>Fleet Reporting Director Matsushima's speech roughly stated: "I am honored that everyone took time out of their busy schedules to attend and watch the film shot by the military reporters of the enemy nation, in which the valiant Japanese air force sank the American aircraft carrier Hornet. As we celebrate the upcoming second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, introducing this film today has profound significance." Director Matsushima continued to say that the film was brought to Shanghai through the efforts of the China Film Company. The film includes aerial and naval battles in the South Pacific, with the Japanese air force launching a fierce attack centered on the enemy aircraft carrier. This film, taken by enemy military reporters, exposes America's own defeats. Therefore, this film not only introduces the fierce battle at the front but also allows us to glimpse the true strength of Japan's military. The United States has conducted thorough research on this battle, and our valiant air force calmly defeated the enemy. It has been a year and a half since the fierce battle of the Solomon Islands began. The Japanese military's brave and fearless operations have inflicted significant damage on the enemy with ingenious tactics, but the United States has always been unwilling to announce the truth about their defeats, covering up the outrage among the domestic population. Japan has long been prepared to destroy the enemy, and we are confident that the most important task at present is to destroy the British and American enemies. Operations are also actively underway in Europe, and the formation of the Chinese air force is also participating in the joint destruction of the British and American enemies.</p>

<p>Dr. Walther, a renowned German economist and current German State Councilor, came to China from Tokyo last month to study the current economic situation in our country. He recently arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing. Kurt, the Information Minister of the German Embassy in the city, hosted a grand welcome tea party at the Hua Mao Hotel on the eighth floor yesterday afternoon. Diplomatic figures from our country, including Ambassador Liang Li, attended, as well as figures from the city's press circles, including Li Zhaozhi of the China Guide, Yan Jiabao of the China B Report, Jin Xiongbo of the Ping Bao, Ren Yunzhu of the News Union, and Gu Lu of the Central News Agency. Allied guests included Izubuchi, the Army Reporting Minister, Lieutenant Nakagawa, Matsushima, the Fleet Reporting Minister, Hirota, the Embassy Information Minister, and Secretary Manabe. Participants from the German side included Minister Guode of the Embassy, Consul General Siewillem, Economic Minister Dr. Tramtiek, Consul General Fersiel, Consul Lorton Schlegel, and Commercial Counselor Wendefei, totaling no fewer than 500 people. The scene was unprecedentedly grand and crowded. Information Minister Kurt personally hosted the event, and successively introduced Walther to the arriving guests. He then gave an introductory speech.</p>
<p>Dr. Walther Gave an Impromptu Speech</p>
<p>Walther then gave a speech, roughly stating: "I have traveled through Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, and now Shanghai, and everywhere I have seen the remarkable achievements of the new Chinese policy, whether in North or Central China. In particular, the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese authorities has made great progress, which is truly gratifying. The improvement and stabilization of the supply of people's food and necessities, as well as the utilization of China's economic strength in the Greater East Asia War, are all goals of this cooperation. By reducing the difficulty of moving materials and limiting the ability to control the Chinese economy through necessary supervision of production and distribution, it will surely make rapid progress in the future. China's agricultural production capacity and the trading achievements of Chinese merchants have always been praised by the world. The more widespread Sino-Japanese cooperation becomes, and the more the basis of trust in the cooperative work for the benefit of both great nations increases, the sooner China's national economic power will be exerted. German economy has always had a very close relationship with China. Most of the many German expatriates in China represent them, and a large part of them have been engaged in business in East Asia for several generations, which is known to all. As citizens of a friendly and allied nation, Germans are particularly concerned about China's development in unification. All Germans are willing to work hard and cooperate in the planned economic measures for the Chinese military in the areas divided by the war. It is still difficult to predict when this war will end, but on the Axis side, both in Europe and in East Asia, we have not only a strong military force but also a solid economic resource preparation sufficient to cope with a long-term war. The Japanese government in East Asia, as the German government does in Europe, plans to develop this strength and resolutely use it to achieve final victory," and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Charity and Education Undertaken by Japanese People: Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>At 271 Dongbaoxing Road, south of Yokohama Bridge, Hongkou, "Old Shanghai" or old Shanghai Christians may still remember that there was a grand and magnificent Christian Huai'en Church there. It was a building that was built with extreme sophistication and in a particularly elegant environment. The withered red old house that inserted into the clouds, below it there were low walls, and on a pair of villa-style gates, now hangs a wooden sign that is a special adornment for the entrance of a Japanese residence, labeled "Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf."</p>
<p>Ringing the doorbell, a kind old woman opened the door, "Ah! You are a Chinese gentleman, coming to visit? I have to ask the Japanese gentleman!"</p>
<p>Crossing the stone-paved courtyard, inside the mansion standing on the right. A Japanese female teacher came out and enthusiastically led the visit to various parts. After a while, the Chinese teacher Mr. Hong Zongyuan finished class and was more willing to talk about everything in the school.</p>
<p>Its predecessor was the "Shanghai Yucai School" at 566 Old Baizi Road. Because the enterprise expanded and deaf students were added, it was renamed "Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf". It specializes in admitting blind and deaf teenagers and young men and women students, teaching them national knowledge and medical school essentials, with the purpose of training personnel in acupuncture, moxibustion, massage, and tuina medicine.</p>
<p>School Organization</p>
<p>The organization of the Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf stipulates the length of study: one year for the primary grade, two years for the middle school, one year for the vocational course, and annually for the research course. The so-called vocational course includes subjects such as acupuncture, moxibustion, massage, and friction therapy. The research course focuses on the research of "Braille" (i.e., blind people's writing). Each year is divided into two semesters, the same as ordinary schools.</p>
<p>The subjects of blind and deaf education mainly include self-cultivation, Japanese language, history, geography, arithmetic, science, physical education, singing, nosology, anatomy, hygiene, physiology, acupuncture, moxibustion, friction therapy, massage, etc.</p>
<p>The enrollment age is stipulated to be 15 years old for primary school students, 25 years old for middle school students, and those who have graduated from primary school or have equivalent academic qualifications from other schools can also enter the class. The age limit for vocational course students is 35 years old, and they can freely audit classes. The class time is stipulated to be from 9 AM to 3 PM every day. Students who wish to register only need to pay a registration fee of one yuan and submit supporting documents to the school's admissions committee. If they are deemed qualified, they can enroll.</p>
<p>From the perspective of scale, organization, and educational methods, the Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf is undoubtedly a rare institution for the blind and deaf in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Intense Teaching</p>
<p>The sound of the piano is melodious in this tall old building. Under the crucifix, the blind students are practicing singing Christian hymns with the blind teacher Mr. Mizutani Gichi. The sound is so loud that it reaches outside the school, as if dozens or hundreds of people are praying and praising. Who knew there were only five students! The teacher said that this is a seed, and he hopes that soon there will be dozens or hundreds of poor and helpless children who will come to praise the final success of the spirit of Christ.</p>
<p>In the literature classroom, the Chinese teacher Mr. Hong Zongyuan is raising his voice and teaching in relatively accurate Mandarin. The blind students, ranging in age from ten to thirty years old, are all copying in notebooks, using special styluses and wax paper to copy Braille. The teachers and students are teaching and learning with all their attention, and the classroom is so tense. However, when you leave the classroom, 閉上門, it is so quiet again, like an old house that has never been inhabited!</p>
<p>Even for Chinese students, Japanese language is still the most important subject. The Japanese language textbooks used are also specially made "Braille" versions. This type of Japanese language "Braille" has fifty basic characters for clear vowel letters, twenty-five characters for voiced consonant letters, thirty characters for contracted sound phonetic Braille, and one hundred and thirty basic letters in total for other long sounds, pauses, beam point symbols, foreign characters, number symbols, Arabic numerals, etc. After being familiar with the spelling of this type of letter, you can use auditory recordings of speeches and speeches, and you can use tactile reading to recite textbooks, books, and magazines. Japan publishes quite a few books and newspapers for the blind. The main one is "Braille Daily," which is edited and published by Suko Kiyoshi and issued by the Mainichi Shimbun. It is published every Thursday, and each issue is about sixteen open pages with ten pages. It already has a history of one thousand one hundred and several dozens of issues, and the school can often receive it as the main spiritual food for blind students.</p>
<p>In order to improve the effectiveness of blind and deaf education, there are also some books on blind and deaf education in the staff room, forming a simple reading room. If the funding is more sufficient and can be expanded a little, it may be more helpful for blind and deaf teachers and students!</p>

<p>The 15th session of the Siyou Youth Basketball League will continue its third act tonight. There will be four games, with the A group accounting for two. From 6:15 PM, there will be two B group games first. The first game is Philippines vs. Soviet Union, and Jinggan vs. Yidui. At 8 PM, the first act of the A group game will take the stage, featuring Huanan vs. Sanlun. Huanan showed its prowess in the past open competitions. The Liu brothers are brave and good at fighting. Sanlun is a team of veterans such as Chuan Xiangrui and Shou Chun. Their strength is quite strong. Huanan will meet tonight, and the process will be tight, which can be said with certainty. The main event is Renyu vs. Shantou Team. Renyu is also passed down from Shanghai stars. Under his command are famous generals such as Yu Zilin, Wan Limi, Ma Canxi, Zhuo Guoxiong, and Lin Weibei. They all belong to the ball field for a while. The whole team is known for its cooperation and understanding. Since winning the championship of the Chinese Youth B Group, the Shantou team has been improving day by day. However, the style of the whole team is purely based on Xingren (that is, Renyu as a teacher and following suit in front of a master), which is not Renyu's enemy and can be predicted. Tonight's schedule is as follows: Philippines vs. Soviet Union at 6:15 PM, Jinggan vs. Yidui at 7:10 PM, Huanan vs. Sanlun at 8 PM, Renyu vs. Shantou Team at 9 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Post-War Monetary System Issues <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Recently, bank newsletters have been discussing "the inflation and rectification of the German currency during the previous European War." The intention seems to be to use this as a springboard to draw the attention of the Chinese people to the issue of post-war monetary system rectification in our country. This column also wishes to take this opportunity to join this discussion.</p>
<p>Originally, the war is not over yet. Rectification of the monetary system is fundamentally impossible to talk about. However, as the saying goes, "If you prepare, you will succeed; if you don't prepare, you will fail." We should put in some research efforts on the issue of post-war monetary system rectification before the war is over, as a measure of planning ahead.</p>
<p>Western countries are not short of precedents for post-war monetary system rectification. Further back, there was the monetary system rectification after the American Civil War in the mid-19th century. The pre-war monetary system was restored seven or eight years after the war, so that creditors and long-term savings depositors suffered no losses. Closer to the present, there was Britain's restoration of the gold standard after the last European War, so that creditors and long-term savers did not suffer losses; France's devaluation and restoration of the new gold standard, so that creditors and long-term savers suffered losses together; and Germany's cancellation of old banknotes and adoption of the new gold standard, so that creditors and long-term savers suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>The direction of our country's post-war monetary system rectification, ideally, will naturally not go beyond one of the four examples mentioned above. However, if we do not talk about the issue of the post-war monetary system, then it is over. Otherwise, the so-called devaluation policy or the policy of maintaining the old currency must be studied one by one, taking the best and making up for the shortcomings, to make the most rational and ideal plan, and to make the people's confidence in the currency its only key. From this, we can achieve the results of stabilizing the people's hearts and suppressing prices. We believe that a strong and people-loving central government must have the ability and methods to formulate and implement a post-war monetary system rectification policy. Because countries around the world today like to talk about post-war recovery plans, we specially raised the issue of the post-war monetary system.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Rural Welfare Association Promotes Loan Work, Signs Cooperation Agreement with Bank of Communications <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Chinese Rural Welfare Association has spared no effort in promoting welfare work. To revitalize the rural economy, it has specifically agreed with the Bank of Communications on a temporary method for jointly promoting agricultural finance. After the two parties exchanged documents and formally signed the agreement, a notice was issued to all district rural service centers to establish farmer loan offices immediately upon receiving the order in Pudong to handle agricultural loans. Loan services began on the 20th of this month. A reporter obtained the following details of the method:</p>
<p>Loan Method in Pudong District</p>
<p>Any farmer residing within Pudong District who genuinely needs the funds for agricultural purposes must submit an application form with the seal of the guarantor and a certificate from the local township head to this office (No. 61, Yangjing Baoren Road). After verification, the office will issue a letter of introduction to the Bank of Communications. Upon receiving the application, the Bank of Communications will conduct a review, dispatch personnel for verification, and then issue a notice and a blank IOU to the applicant to complete the loan procedures at the bank. Merchants acting as guarantors are acceptable, without requiring any collateral. The addresses of the stores are limited to Yangjing, Qichang, Dongchang, and Shanghai. The total loan amount is tentatively set at one million yuan, with a monthly interest rate limited to three percent. The loan term is determined based on the actual situation but should not exceed one year. The loan amount per household ranges from one thousand to five thousand yuan, with a maximum of ten thousand yuan. The application period is from November 20th of this year to January 19th of next year, limited to two months, with no extensions.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency): Since the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Commercial and Trade Commission began handling the purchase of wheat and its distribution to flour mills in various regions, as well as the supply and demand of wheat flour, its operations have become increasingly smooth. It has been learned that for any movement, export, or import of wheat or bran, a transport permit is required. Even with a permit, it must be stamped by the local branch office of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee; otherwise, it will be confiscated. The Commercial and Trade Commission has also obtained the cooperation of the Central China Railway Company and inland waterway shipping companies to implement this measure.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Restrictions on Applying for Moving Soap-Making Raw Materials Such as Asphalt <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Soap and Candle Industry Association recently wrote to the Commercial and Trade Commission to inquire whether the movement of asphalt is restricted, so as to facilitate its transportation. According to a reporter's inquiry, there are many types of non-edible oils that can be used as raw materials for making soap and candles. The oils commonly used by soap and candle factories in Shanghai include coconut oil, asphalt, green oil, and cottonseed oil. Given the current shortage of the aforementioned raw materials for various factories in Shanghai, and the difficulty in procuring them, to maintain the production volume of Shanghai's soap and candle factories, any applications for moving these materials out will not be approved. The Commercial and Trade Commission has already conveyed this intention to the association in a written response.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks rose across the board. The trend of small investors driving up prices has subsided slightly. Some investors are again favoring old stocks, and there is a renewed trend of buying them. As help reappeared, the yarn companies came in, so the latter rose more than the former. Trading was brisk throughout the day. The minds of people from all sides were flustered. The condition of the stocks in each industry are recorded below:</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On Company outside the eight passes for a long time, after coming out, returned, and in the end it, Sincere Company, and National Goods all rose slightly. Innerwear and Guohua Department Stores both remained stable.</p>
<p>Textiles: Wing On Textiles is still rising, up half a grade. Mei Ya, China Textiles, and Sino-British all found their way up, the latter having passed the big hurdle. Rong Feng received attention. Jingfu socks also rose by more than one yuan. Jinglun soared to twice the hurdle. Zhenfeng cotton weaving rose steadily. Yuanyuan printing and dyeing rose steadily and circularly.</p>
<p>New Medicine: China-France went out of the seventh pass, and China-Asia both saw increases. New Star was quite stable.</p>
<p>Finance: Sri Hing made a small move, but there was no market beyond that.</p>
<p>Culture: Commercial Press and Chung Hwa again had high prices every day, World rose steadily, and China Film has fallen back.</p>
<p>Public Utilities: Zhabei Water and Electricity went out of the pass, and China Electric also saw increases.</p>
<p>Real Estate: Wing Hing was stable, Tianfeng was outstanding, and Luen Hwa and New Yick both rose.</p>
<p>Other: Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company soared by a whopping eight grades. Great China Match Company rose and then fell back. The rising Guan brand is in a steady state. Jiu An Industrial retreated after knocking on the gate. China-Asia Construction rose again by more than one yuan. China Investment, Standard Flavoring Powder, remained stable. Dahua Livestock buyers are still enthusiastic, and Xinghua buyers are stable. San Le Industrial was bought at 70% above face value, and the momentum was very strong.</p>
<p>Summary of Market Conditions</p>
<p>Public Bonds: Unified Public Bonds are flat and weak in the gray market, still suppressed by sales seeking to cash out. Type C rose slightly. Types A, B, D, and E each saw slight increases, but the overall mood remained weak.</p>
<p>Call Loan Interest Rates: The call loan interest rate of the Money Industry Association remained unchanged at 1.7%.</p>
<p>Grain: National rice continued to fall, with 5,000 to 6,000 bags arriving by train. The city's rice reserves are abundant, and there is a sense of oversupply. New japonica rice and Nanjing pointed rice all saw small declines. Small eaters did not enter, and the market mood weakened further.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Prices also fell sharply. Sha Huang, selected green beans, and Fatty beans all showed signs of oversupply.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: Mei Li brand alone saw increases. British-American goods have stabilized. Great Britain, Old Knife, Great Front Gate, and Quan Lu were all flat.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Transactions were not numerous. Gu Ben White, Xiang Mao Yellow, and Xiang Mao Scissors Soaps were all flat. Mei Li and Phoenix firecrackers were also stable. The former had buyers coming in to purchase. Candles were still in demand by buyers, and both White Light and Shi Qiao were trending upward.</p>

<p>However, in my previous paper, I already clearly pointed out that if Germany and Italy were to fail, the wall blocking Soviet influence from infiltrating Europe would be completely gone. At the same time, this means that the pressure suppressing liberalism and communism on the European continent would suddenly disappear. After the demise of fascism in Europe, what will fill the political "vacuum"? One can imagine that the European liberalism and communism, which had been suppressed with great effort due to the existence of the German and Italian regimes, would develop rapidly like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. In particular, the post-war poverty of the masses will provide communism with the best ground for development. This can be understood by referring to the situation after the last World War. During the last World War, there was no large communist base. However, this time, there is a communist Soviet Union in the form of a world power. If the wall of Germany and Italy collapses completely and the Soviet Union takes advantage of its victory to infiltrate post-war Europe, the consequences are self-evident. In that situation, can the United Kingdom and the United States replace Germany and Italy in preventing communism from infiltrating Europe? As a result of the Three-Power Conference, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States reached a "compromise," so the Soviet Union may not want to intervene in the West? However, today's problem is not simply whether the Soviet Union wants to, but the rise of communism throughout Europe. The unprecedented and astonishingly huge war of attrition currently taking place in Europe will inevitably cause poverty that is not limited to Germany and Italy. Germany has now transformed the whole of Europe into a great production organization centered on Germany (including a great political institution centered on Germany). So, to take a step back, if, as Chongqing is "sweetly dreaming," Germany disintegrates within this year, then, of course, the entire European production mechanism (including the entire European political mechanism) will also disintegrate accordingly. As a result, one can imagine that the whole of Europe will face unprecedented economic chaos and poverty. If one considers this poverty, it will be exploited by the communists who have been unable to raise their heads in places like Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Hungary, and Poland. What will the European political situation be like at that time? Even an idiot can imagine this problem. However, at that time, the United Kingdom and the United States are still engaged in a large-scale war of attrition with Japan. No matter how hard the United Kingdom and the United States try, they cannot save Europe's economic poverty. What is more, the people of the United Kingdom and the United States, especially the people of the United Kingdom, are also suffering from economic poverty that they do not know when it will end! Therefore, the tide of European communism will probably also spark communist movements in the United Kingdom and the United States, especially the communist movement in the United Kingdom, which will then most likely threaten the status of the ruling classes of the United Kingdom and the United States, who are currently waging war. Given this, the "sweet dream" that the United Kingdom and the United States will solve the European problem, withdraw from Europe, use all their energy to deal with the Greater East Asia battle line, launch a major offensive, defeat Japan, and then offer "final victory" to Chongqing with both hands, cannot but arouse great suspicion.</p>
<p>Of course, the politicians in Chongqing and the United Kingdom and the United States can also foresee this danger. It is precisely because of this reason that they convened the Three-Power Conference in Moscow from October 19th to 30th. They declared that this meeting was "satisfactorily" completed. They bragged that after the end of the war, the Soviet Union vowed to cooperate with the United Kingdom and the United States on European issues. However, this does not mean that after the collapse of Germany, Stalin vowed to jointly suppress the activities of the communist parties in European countries with the United Kingdom and the United States. In his speech on the 26th anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution, which was held shortly after the end of the Three-Power Conference, Stalin said: "After European countries, such as France, Belgium, Yugoslavia, Poland, Greece, etc., are liberated from Hitler's hands, the people of each country will freely decide their political system." In this situation, what does the people's right to self-determination of their political system mean? If the people like the Hitler regime, will they be allowed to freely decide such a political system? Obviously not. Stalin clearly foresaw what kind of political system the European people would "freely decide" at that time. It is precisely for this reason that he made this statement. Waiting for the revolutionary conditions in each country to mature, this is Stalin's consistent policy. Although Trotsky exported Soviet-made revolutions to countries around the world, Stalin, as he clearly stated when he met H.G. Wells, will adopt the policy of "not exporting revolutions abroad." The Soviet Union's attitude at the Three-Power Conference is sufficient to prove its great confidence in the political situation in post-war Europe, that is, in the maturing of the conditions for the communist revolution. As the German Foreign Ministry declared on November 2nd, the Three-Power Conference: "Is the Soviet Union's victory in Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States' failure, is nothing more than the fact that the whole of Europe will succumb to Bolshevism." Although the United Kingdom and the United States and Chongqing know the danger of Bolshevism, they have to use the Soviet Union's statement as a way to quench their thirst with poison. This proves the urgent situation. This is just like an opium addict who knows that smoking opium will lead to death, but cannot help but continue to smoke it. And the most obvious example of this disease is, of course, the Chongqing government, the weakest link in what they call the "world's four major powers."</p>
<p>Stalin also said in the same speech: "Last year, the Axis forces on the Eastern Front numbered 240 divisions, of which 179 were German divisions, but this year there are 257 divisions, of which the German army reached 207 divisions." This is clearly a veiled reference to the powerlessness of the United Kingdom and the United States. Looking at this, one can also understand that if Germany fails in Europe one day, the Soviet Union will declare its position to the world—I am the one who defeated Germany. The Soviet Union's prestige in the world will immediately directly affect the development of the communist forces in various countries. Especially in China, which is connected to the Soviet Union's border and has the largest communist party after the Soviet Communist Party, its political influence will definitely be greater. What will be the fate of the Chongqing regime at that time? This is a question that Chiang Kai-shek must consider again and again. But the answer to this question, of course, is not to be found in the mind, but must be found in the course of the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

<h3 id="e52">YMCA Holds Charity Bazaar to Collect Winter Clothing, Uses Vouchers Instead of Cash <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>To actively carry out the winter clothing drive, the YMCA of Shanghai will hold a charity bazaar on the second floor of the Baisen Building from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the 28th of this month, with a target of 100,000 yuan. The items for sale will be products, antiques, calligraphy, paintings, jewelry, etc., that have been solicited from major companies, manufacturers, or private individuals. Since the preparations began, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have responded with assistance, donating items worth approximately 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. However, the goal has not yet been reached. It is hoped that major companies, manufacturers, and enthusiastic people will donate items. It is also hoped that philanthropists in the city will respond and compete to purchase, both obtaining real objects and helping the poor. The "Fu Lu Chang Chun" painting is now scheduled to be displayed in the YMCA Library in Baisen Bridge starting this Thursday. All are welcome to visit.</p>
<p>All items sold at this charity bazaar will not use cash, but will use vouchers specially printed by the YMCA. These vouchers are divided into four types: 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. They are now on sale at the YMCA information centers on Sichuan Road and Baisen Bridge. It is hoped that all sectors will actively purchase them.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Children's Welfare Association Distributes Winter Clothing Early <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The China Children's Welfare Association has a remaining stock of 500 sets of new cotton-padded clothes and trousers for children aged four to fourteen from the winter clothing drive for poor children in the city last year. Due to the sudden cold at the beginning of winter, the Association is distributing these winter clothes early so that general poor children can have the necessary items to protect themselves from the cold and get through the severe winter. Children who need winter clothing can go directly to the Association (Room 208, Zhonghui Building, Edward Road) to apply for distribution. According to Ding Bingnan, the general affairs officer of the Association, the price of each set of winter clothing last year was 30 yuan, but this year it must be over 300 yuan. Moreover, due to the fabric situation, it is not possible to produce them in large quantities at present. The Association welcomes donations of new or used cotton-padded clothes, sanitary shirts, shoes, socks, etc., and will distribute them on your behalf.</p>

<p>Ms. Wang Dezhu and Ms. Wang Shiru are holding an exhibition and charity sale of their recent works at the Shanghai Art Gallery (intersection of Zhejiang Road and Xiepo Road). Half of the proceeds will be donated to the school's scholarship fund and the Xinwen Bao's scholarship loan fund. The opening was held the day before yesterday (until the 28th). The reporter visited yesterday. The calligraphy is old and vigorous, which is rare among women. The paintings, including figures, landscapes, flowers, and birds, are all vivid and lifelike. People from all walks of life are contributing to the purchase, both obtaining valuable calligraphy and paintings and benefiting the Confucian community and poor students. A double benefit, don't miss it. (Sun Choucheng)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Letter from the Chinese Health Association to All Physicians <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Health Association is conducting a free X-ray examination of 10,000 citizens' lungs this month. In addition to the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao Social Service Departments distributing the free X-ray examination vouchers, the Association is also requesting all physicians of the Physicians' Association to distribute them uniformly. To aid the poor and sick, the letter states that pulmonary tuberculosis is rampant in the city. The Association, despite its limited resources, is conducting free X-ray examinations for 10,000 people. On the principle of not increasing the burden on citizens, the Association aims to raise social awareness of tuberculosis prevention and provide opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment. We are now sending ten examination vouchers and request that you distribute them to poor patients. If they come for examination, a report will be immediately provided. The examination report will still be reviewed by your esteemed physicians, so that patients can be diagnosed early and treatment can be started as soon as possible. We hope to use the power of the community to achieve the great effect of prevention.</p>
