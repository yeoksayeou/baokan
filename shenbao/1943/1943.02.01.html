<p>社評</p>
<h3>戰時經濟與取締投機</h3>
<p>對英美正式宣戰以後、本報曾就戰時經濟政策，增加生產諸端，作有系統的和積極性的獻言。現時講戰時經濟，，除了積極的各種努力設施之外，自然還要有消極的辦去，互相配合，才會發生實祭的效力。現在再闡述所見，以作蒭蕘之獻。</p>
<p>一般所謂戰時經濟政策，其要義就在乎能適應非常時期的經濟政策，其目的在集中和強化經濟各　門的工作，提高經濟政策的效力，爭取戰爭的最後勝利。所以，凡是遠反這一最高原則，凡予戰爭以不利影響的，凡足以削弱戰鬥力量的，都須採取非常手段，加以取締，而在目前最嚴重的，便是投幾—變相的投機。說一句老實話，上海的罪惡，本來歷年都是由投機者的謠言所造成的。尤其是這幾年來，所謂「非常時期」，更替一般投機者造成了機會，以刦取取暴利。而平常一般游資的擁有者，也因為投機有暴利可章，也就紛紛置投資的正路，踴向投機的邪路。結果一方面造成物價的高漲，一方面又因投資於生產者裏足不前，而造成物資缺少的現象。同時，又因生產部門的停滯，失業者的增加，更造成一般人民購買力的低落，結果不僅造成了社會上的恐慌現象，並且使國家的財政經濟都受到不良的影響。近半年來雖經中日當局一再嚴厲取締外匯，烚赤，棉紗等方面的投機之風，可是，市上的游資因爲找不到正當的出路，便又在「投資」的虛名之下，以統債，華股爲投機的對象，市價時常大漲大落，謠言亦由此繁興，人心為此而動搖，社會爲此而不安。這種情形，對於政府實施戰時經濟政策，實在是極大的障礙。因此，取締變相的投機，便成爲目前最迫切的政策之一。</p>
<p>中日當局對於取締投機，早有原則和辦法，無待贅言。我們認爲在今日尙須特別注意的，可分兩層來說：在消極方面，是必須澈底的實行限止，公債之必須實行限制辦法　　無解釋的必要，卽對於華股，似乎也應有相當的辦法，要知道目前以華股爲主體的變相投機，不僅有一般專作投機者在鼓風作浪，卽若干握有華股的股主，也在推波助瀾。因此，使一輩企業家不能專心計劃事業的發展，還須以一部分時間與精神，來應付市場上自己股票的張落。如果有了相當的限價，那麽，風浪也就失去了活動的機會。然而，取締投機，也不能單靠消極的辦法，如統制，限價，取締等等，而必須以更大的努力，放在積極方面。第一，當局必須迅速和縝密的確定發展農業和工業的政策，使游資的擁有者，澈底明瞭投資獲利的正當道路。第二，當局必須從主要的幾方而，造成投資於工農生產事業的安全與有利的條件。例如特別保障民　的工農業生產，實行工農業生產事業的保息制度，實行大規模的工農業貸款，而歡迎民間游資參加，給予特別優越的利潤。第三，當局對於工業原料必須充分供給，交通運輸必須予以最大的方便，和生產品市塲的合理分配等等。第四，對於一般以政府或以日本勢力爲後盾而壟斷一切，刧取暴利的特殊階級，必須加以嚴厲的制裁。我們深信目前的投機風潮，最重要的原因，還在於游資的擁有者，找不到安全和有利的出路，只要當局眞誠實行上述幾點，切實保障，引導游資進人生產正路，我們深信投機之風，不制而自止。正像治水一樣，與其處處堵塞而不免處處潰决，實不如大舉疏　，不僅可免洪水之災，且可收灌溉之益。</p>
<p>最後，我們要向擁有游資的和從事投機事業的忠吿者：第一，投機在平時已是冒險事業，為有組織的國家所不許存在的。　在戰時，這種危害國家社會的行為，既要受自己良心的　備，又不免受到國家法令最嚴厲的制裁。投機者必須知道，暴利之獲得為偶然，爲倖致，而刑罰法令的制裁，却是必然和不可逃避的。第二，我們更應澈底明瞭投機事業是一種賭博，不論是公債和華股，一變而爲投機的主體，那就誰也不能保障自己的投機性的「投資」的安全。那麽，誰從事投機，那不僅是自走絕路，而且要變成國家社會的罪人。</p>

<h3>巡視蘇芬前線記</h3>
<p>— 嬉野</p>
<p>（讀賣報知嬉野特派員二十二日赫爾新基（芬蘭京城）電）　記者承芬蘭軍當局　好意，准許在卡累利阿戰綫視察四天。望見了冰凍不開的喀琅斯塔得軍港和列寗格勒市街。先特乘火車到維堡，再換軍用車到戴利奧基附近的某地去訪問前綫司令部，又越過舊蘇芬國境，在右首看見喀琅斯塔得、從森林中視察砲聲震天的前綫情形之後，又北上視察刺多牙湖西岸的卡契薩爾米等處前綫根據地。自高加索至莫斯科一段的中南部戰塲，因蘇軍的冬季反攻，尚見活潑，但芬蘭戰綫則比較沉寂，僅小規模的前哨接觸戰，戰綫和一年以前沒有什麼大變動，據司令部的負責人稱：最近丁莫生柯被任用為列寗格勒及刺多牙湖南部的最高司令官後，還沒有發動大規模冬季攻勢的情形。假使有的話，或許和去年一樣到三四月裏發動亦未可知，但是芬蘭方面的防備非常鞏固，所以沒有什麼不安，這一方面的戰局，或許有告一段落的可能</p>
<p>芬蘭兵士朝氣蓬勃</p>
<p>從戴利奧基南方的海岸到喀琅斯塔得，相距不過十七公里，在喀琅斯塔得島的前方，有七隻土灶，從海岸到托得列孟很近，不足十公里，幸而天氣很好，望見喀琅斯塔得非常淸楚，尤其是托得列孟，因為地處最近，用望遠鏡一看，可以望見紅軍的行動，晚上，雙方的溜冰哨隊，在冰上小接觸。戴利奧基還有帝俄時代那些貴族王侯在此消暑的遺跡，海灘上的富麗別墅，因為近年來的戰爭，平添了許多彈痕。芬蘭兵在岸邊的冰上，嬉笑着游戲。這裏氣候極冷，一天不過三四小時有陽光。記者在途中據領路的將校告訴我，殘餘的蘇聯波羅的海艦隊，現下冰凍在喀琅斯塔得，蘇聯每天在晚上用馬匹，卡車，輕戰車裝運物資，偷渡過冰凍的海上，去接濟喀琅斯塔得，記者聽了這幾句話，不由得想起了在斯得哥爾摩看見的蘇聯新聞片，蘇聯影片拍攝的鏡頭，就像上面所說，在冰凍的刺多牙湖上，設置公路，並局部舖設輕便鐵道，接濟被困在列寗格勒的蘇軍，並且撤退了一部份市民，輕戰車的確在喀琅斯塔得，列寗格勒間的冰凍海上通過無疑了。</p>
<p>有浴室設備營房</p>
<p>到了最前綫的陣地上，周身感覺得戰雲的緊張。跑到建設在厚冰上的監視所上一望，看得列寗格勒很淸楚，用望遠鏡一看，一片銀粉世界，在茫茫白色之中，南部的一方黑塊，就是列寗格勒。昨天晚上因為遭受德機空襲，投彈擊中目的，雪夜空中，添了火光獨天的紅色。列寗格勒北方的芬蘭戰綫，沒有什麼接觸，德軍担任的列寗格勒東南戰塲，似有蘇軍出動反攻，記者走下監視所，轉向丘陵上走去，軍隊的營房，被大雪所蔽，在遠的地方已經看不出有營房，這個營房是用木頭造的，每一所可以住十四五個人，當中放着一隻爐子，相當溫煖，連電燈都一應俱全，在廚房邊上，還有芬蘭式的浴室，內部簡單樸素，在窗口檯子上，放着許多書本和鮮花，足以安慰戰綫的無聊。</p>
<p>女性活動不亞男子</p>
<p>戴利奧基戰綫方面，除了形形色色的冬季戰綫風光之外，還有芬蘭愛國婦女團體經營的商塲，在商塲內另闢一室，供給軍士們習歌消遣之用，這裏戰綫的食糧，比了京城赫爾新基還要豐富，因為去年芬蘭穀豐收，所以食糧有餘。至於食糖等等，雖然不怎樣樣豐富，但是沒有像斯德哥爾摩方面所說得那樣嚴重。</p>
<p>至於那個愛國婦女團體，已經有了很長的歷史，在一九二一年，芬蘭婦女為了復興戰後貧困的祖國，就組織了這個團體，在社會上非常活躍，這個團體在歐洲方面也很有名。從這次對蘇作戰之後，它的活動更為努力，不但使男子無後顧之憂，而且出動到前綫，芬蘭的婦女，差不多大部份來參加，活動範圍很廣，單就以上幾點來看，已可證明芬蘭婦女的愛國熱情，可以說是有為的娘子軍吧！總會在赫爾新基，會長是羅考娜女士，今年已經七十多歲，記者去訪問她，聽到了一些會務情形，據說會員已經越出三十幾萬，除了特殊的職員以外，都沒有報酬，工作方面，不亞於男子，甚至出動到前綫，替軍隊煮飯，洗衣，看護，最近還開始担任防空監視兵，食糧，　藥的運送工作，因為芬蘭人口不多，所以女性儘可能出力，在非戰鬥部份替男性的心力，這樣子的精神，眞使人嘆服。</p>
<p>絕對信賴德軍</p>
<p>從戰利奧基乘軍用車到刺多牙西岸卡契薩爾米，路上足有小時，而且天氣奇冷，手足都失了知覺。卡契薩爾米的破壞最厲害，一九四一年秋天，蘇軍後退之後，留在這裏的居戶，不過幾家。卡契薩爾米和北岸的蘇爾太勃拉，在夏季裏是刺多加快速艇作戰的根據地，到了冬季裏，刺多牙湖上就冰凍得鐵石一般。記者因為時間關係，雖然沒有到摩爾曼斯克去旅行，但我曉得蘇聯在夏天為了避免德機的轟炸，把亞爾干日爾當做起卸港，等到了冬天再來利用摩爾曼斯克，想從這裏利蘇用洛克，亞爾干日爾的鐵道，把英美的物資運送到內地去，芬蘭方面非常信賴德國，希望德國在不久的將來　調餘力到南戰塲，從北方貫通列寗格勒，以便卡累利阿戰綫可告一段落，同時截斷摩爾曼斯克鐵道，切斷從北方所來的蘇聯物資，希望德國從速在這方面發揮威力，這當然是極正當的希望。（任：譯自一月二十五日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>懷念所羅門</h3>
<p>— 高原</p>
<p>（○○根據地高原特派員（海軍報道班員）電）在大東亞戰爭下迎賓其第二度新年之○○根據地，於元旦拂曉，即有哨戒機數架，勇敢地向沙羅門海方面出動。戰爭是沒有新年的，現在為要澈底遏阻敵人的蠢動，哨戒的任務一刻也不能疎忽，此等哨戒機，必須出動至洋上○○海里的遠處，站在戰綫的最尖端。然而例如拍發「發現敵人機動部隊」那樣赫赫的敵情報告第一電，成為大海戰的端緒者，恐在多數哨戒機中不過幾十分甚至幾百分之一而已。其餘則悉被埋沒於戰果之下，視為單純的工作，而輒被遺忘。記者這次非常幸運，受命附乘哨戒機，得以目擊哨戒的辛勞，同時得有機會，由空中視察全世界所注目之所羅門海。</p>
<p>海軍機附乘記</p>
<p>三日拂曉，○○根據地有猛烈的風雨，但至天大亮時，風雨漸已停息，然而濃霧大作，瀰漫滿天：等到霧散，○○長下了「發動」的命令時，已逾預定出發時刻一個半鐘頭以上了。在陰沈的雨雲之間，望見有一處彷彿明朗，坐機即向着那飛過去了。不知是不是氣流惡劣的緣故，飛機動搖得很利害。這時有一個機員拍我的肩膀，回頭一看，他正提着一隻搪瓷碗，滿盛年糕湯，送過來給我。記者因為在地上等待開機的時候，已經吃過了，所以就搖手推辭，機員們也好像都已吃過了一樣，誰也不再機上進這早餐了，然而這一碗年糕湯，却使人頗有「機上的新年」之感。</p>
<p>眼下的珊瑚礁</p>
<p>雲一霄時，機下就有島嶼看見。去年秋天，記者曾在附乘的運輸艦上眺望過而已有深刻印象的各島，這時均在雲層之下點點排列着。蜿蜒曲折的海岸綫，處處有珊瑚礁鑲成白色的邊緣。更在海岸附近，可望見有一二之處，很像農民的部落。還可看見有若干部分業已　墾的椰子林。此外所見的，則為各種樹木，競求强烈的日光，層層上疊生長，如是而成的千古之密林。由空中眺望，沙羅門實呈現着美麗而柔和的天然姿態，然而它的現實，却懷着可怕的杀气，兵艦和飞機等，正往來於此。自○○島附近，坐機即改取了○方向而前進，剛繼所見的各島，於是愈看愈遠，漸至僅見其島影隱約浮現於水平綫上而已。</p>
<p>飛翔敵地上空</p>
<p>島影漸漸模糊，坐機則次第增加其高度，種種形狀的雲塊，都從機下飛去，一直飛到像已飛過了雲原之感的雲端上，機長時時向左面，右面，前面，細細視察，在廣闊的海上，雖一船亦逃不過他的眼下。手已閒着的駕駛員，則取出雙眼望遠鏡來觀察大雲的邊際。因為此刻已飛到敵地的上空了，隨時就會遇見敵人的戰鬭機，所以必須這樣緊張地警戒着。機長的命令時時刻刻從傳聲管裏傳過來，駕駛員就照着命令，使機翼或向左傾，或向右傾，把機體放到容易眺望的位置，務使可以觀察到極遠的地方。</p>
<p>哨戒任務辛勞</p>
<p>自從開始採取了高度飛之後○小時，氧氣的味道也已吸飽了的時候，坐機已把受命進至○○海裏的任務完畢，於是就飛上了返防之途。始終坐着未做一事的記者，這時已感到非常疲乏，而機員們也不免有辛苦之色。一想到為要確知「南太平洋沒有異狀」的一日而必須每日去盡如此的辛勞，就不禁有所深感。這時機員又拍着記者的肩膀，送過晝食來了，是油炒豆腐飯拌着海苔的飯糰，還有一小罐牛肉菜湯。飛到○○島附近，祇見先前飛過去時尚沒有什麼引人注意的積亂雲，這時已發達到凄凄的形狀了，沙羅門海的天氣，變化之烈，於此可見一斑。以未見敵人的船舶及飛機的報告，作為回見的禮物，○小時的飛行就此完畢而降陸了。這時部隊長即來徵詢記者的感想，我便告以「去看了島和雲和海而回來了」，旁邊的○○隊長即笑着說：「就是祇看見了島也算好囉」，廣闊的太平洋之防衛，單是海的哨戒一事，亦是多少重要呢，這樣想來，哨戒的任務，實在是辛勞的。（才：譯自一月十七日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>紀念東聯二週年</h3>
<p>— 陳孚木</p>
<p>我曾經屢次指出，「東亞聯盟運動是以帝國主義者在亞洲百餘年來侵略的歷史為根據，是對帝國主義者侵略的一個在現階段的反抗。」而這一次東亞聯盟中國總會成立二週年紀念，又適値在國民政府宣佈對英美參戰以後，因此更使我們覺得這一次二週年紀念之意義的深長，和我們今後所負使命的重大。</p>
<p>二年以來，東亞聯盟在中國，我們雖則不敢說已經打下了穩固的基礎，然而我們却不能否認，我們的工作同志的確是付出了不少的血和汗的代價。今後我們的努力，更不用說非要經過猛烈的鬥爭不可的。</p>
<p>無論中國和日本，五年以來，經過了血和鐵的鬥爭，在今天「他們都覺悟到戰爭解決不了中日兩國問題，從使兩國的國力消耗，徒使兩國的裂痕和仇恨加深，這並不是中日兩國之利，尤非東亞之利。」因此，正當我國旣已宣佈和日本並肩作戰的時候，我們對戰爭的態度，更是堅決的，我們對於所以從事東亞聯盟運動的行徑更顯得正確。</p>
<p>東亞聯盟運動的目的，不僅是解決中日兩國的問題，也是解決東亞整個的問題。東亞各民族百餘年來，處在帝國主義者的侵略，威迫，利誘，剝削，踐踏和挑撥離間之下，他們在今天的覺悟是無可否認的，他們需要團結，需要解放，也是無可否認的。東亞聯盟的政治理想——政治獨立，經濟合作，軍事同盟，文化溝通等四大綱領，正是東亞各民族的具體要求；也祗有這樣偉大而正確的要求和理想，才能團結束亞各民族共同奮鬥的意志，也祗有這樣適合於東亞各民族共同發展的綱領，才能保證大東亞戰爭最後的勝利。</p>
<p>東亞聯盟運動在日本，儘管曾經引起過不少政治上的反感；可是截至目前為止，還沒有一個能從理論上具體地，系統地，地力地，把東亞聯盟理論駁倒的人，也可以說這理論是無從駁倒的。</p>
<p>東亞聯盟在中國，因着日本政治的影響，雖則還有不少的人缺乏參加這一運動的勇氣；雖則還有不少的人還抱着相當懷疑的態度；但『我敢斷言，東亞聯盟運動就是和平運動的靈魂。和平運動如果不努力推行東亞聯盟運動，則理論上可說是毫無立塲的。』而且「東亞聯盟運動是以孫中山先生的大亞洲主義作思想根據的。換句話說，這運動便是孫中山先生大亞洲主義之再提倡。」</p>
<p>因此，正當東亞聯盟中國總會二週年紀念的今天，國民政府旣經宣佈參戰的現在，雖則這一運動仍然處在困難與複雜的環境下，我還得重複一次，我們對於這一運動的信念。我認為東亞聯盟理想之實現，我們可以預見的，可有下列的現象：</p>
<p>（一）侵略的戰爭從此必歸消滅；</p>
<p>（二）各民族均得樹立其獨立自主的國家；</p>
<p>（三）經濟上各國有無相通，以長補短，樹立共榮的制度；</p>
<p>（四）文化的融會而使各民族均能同情了解，泯除猜忌；</p>
<p>（五）東亞將成為世界和平的穩定力量。</p>

<h3>東亞聯盟與中國參戰</h3>
<p>— 陳中</p>
<p>由東亞聯盟運動　說到中國參戰</p>
<p>東亞聯盟運動，在中國開始發動，雖祗有兩年的歷史，可是這個運動思想的產生，則遠在十多年以前。</p>
<p>國父曾於北上的時候，在日本倡議大亞洲主義，為恢復亞洲民族的生存，可惜彼時中日兩國朝野人士，對此呼聲未能深澈解悟，結果竟鑄成中日事　五年以來慘重犧牲的大錯。固是英美等帝國主義在中國角逐。使中國國力消弱，發現依存和恐懼的心理所致。同時，也是由於中日兩方未能開誠相與，使一般主張中日合作的政治家，無法接受這個理想，這不能不說是東亞聯盟史實中一件足以悔悟的事。直到國民政府還都南京，締結中日間基本關係條約。中日兩國，才漸漸　識中國民族及日本民族於現實上有不可分離的關係。</p>
<p>東亞聯盟能够順利進行，非　使中日事變完全解決不可，要解決中國問題，則非驅出英美惡勢力於東亞之外不可。今後的東亞一方面當然繼續進行作戰，澈底擊滅英美。一方面更需要進行建設大東亞共榮圈的偉業，無論在作戰上或是建設上，東亞民族始終是休戚相共協力以赴的。</p>
<p>中國政府為實踐同甘共苦一致協力的聲明，所以本年一月九日已正式宣佈參加大東亞戰爭，並與友邦日本簽訂中日共同宣言，兩國政府以堅强的決意與信念，在軍事上政治上經濟上作共同之協力。同時，交還租界暨撤廢領事裁判權等。至此，我們就可由中國參戰的決心，看出東亞聯盟運動已有偉大的成就。</p>
<p>中國參戰為履行東亞聯盟初步之事實表現</p>
<p>中國正式向英美宣戰之後，已引起日本朝野莫大的贊許和感奮，以及德義等國的同情。依照東亞聯盟綱領規定，我們第一應達到政治獨立。</p>
<p>至於經濟，因於特殊地理的條件及經濟條件的支配，尤其是東亞各民族公佈於東亞大陸，各有各的經濟發展階段，各有各的需要與習慣，彼此提携。所以經濟合作，今後更有加緊推進的必要。中日旣是戰友之邦，是應基於平等的意義，實行（一）物資：使能有無相通，以適應供需的平衡。（二）人材：要相互供給，以發展各國的經濟力。可是經濟範圍很廣，在作戰的時期，一般人多着重工業及交通貿易及經濟管制等部門，我國工業向來落後，不是一個工業國，而是一個大農業國家，似於動員經濟作戰力量不及日本之大，可是戰時糧食及一切原料品，在戰時則有決勝的重要性。因戰時動員數百萬大軍，其給養及民食供應實不亞於軍火的補充的追切。中國在參加大東亞戰爭之後，中國的經濟參戰的力量，殊不可輕視。過去日本對於中日經濟合作高唱入雲，結果很少成效可言，其原因很多，而最主要的是未實行合作條件的精神所致。大家應該明瞭經濟合作的前提，第一必須各單位有合作的力量，力量是國家自身建成的，所以經濟合作同時應注意各單位國家自發努力的因素。我們希望於中國參戰後，中日兩國進一不簽訂互惠的經濟協定，這個協定是完全平等互惠的，使兩國應在一切經濟部門互相舉其全力，發揮參戰的力量。</p>
<p>再次，東亞聯盟綱領中的軍事同盟，與中國參戰，發生直接關係，我國參戰，是否就是履行軍事同盟的初步實現？參戰後如何予大東亞戰爭有力的協助，現在應有加以深刻探討的必要。其四關於文化溝通，是與經濟合作有同樣重要性，這裏要特別提示的，文化是文明的泉源，東亞聯盟是求東亞共存共榮的主體，所以文化應是採取溝通的方法。而不應採取同化的手段。</p>
<p>中國參戰應如何增強軍事力量</p>
<p>大家知道今日的戰爭，是用技術戰，所以現代戰爭，非僅人與人的戰，實為物與物的戰，也是科學與科學的戰。現在我國軍力如何？是應先加自行檢討。中國在事變發生之後，原有薄弱武力，多已損耗，國民政府還都以來，對於建軍工作，已不遺餘力。但仍是去理想甚遠。自前年對日成立三億圓借款，即以用為置辦大批軍械，充實軍力。</p>
<p>新中國的軍備，是否能够分擔大東亞戰爭的大任，我們應該注意戰爭二個條件，第一，要有協助盟邦作戰的力量，現在軍備固然很薄弱，但是日本不能予以充份的協助，尤於軍械的補充要有大量的供給，不難在短期內訓績成為强有力的陸軍。第二，要有協助盟邦綏靖後方的軍事力量，日前中國的軍備，一時旣不足直接對英美作戰，可是中國後方綏靖的責任，義不容辭有自動擔起來的必要。還有，中國自參戰以後，有一部份人不明是非，認為於參戰中或附有與日本締結軍事同盟，不過這點已由褚外長正式發表談話，吾認　日軍事同盟協定，事實上依照目前軍事力量，祇有先事協力綏靖後方的治安，以分擔大東亞戰爭之重責，但是日本為加强中國參戰力量，對於中國建軍，至少要有以下的認識：</p>
<p>（一）中國建軍為謀中日合作條件的達成，由局部治安的維持，以鞏固全面治安的維持，如此，中國如不建軍，即不能達成任務，所以中國建軍工作應予全力贊助。</p>
<p>（二）中國境內撤兵問題，為大東亞戰爭開始後所應急需考慮的。撤兵如能逐步實現，大東亞戰爭的力量必能增加。而撤兵換防之責，繫於中國之建軍的完成，其理甚明。所以中國新軍的建立，實為實現軍事同盟先決條件，也是一個有力保證。</p>
<p>（三）中日合作係基於王道精神，中日兩方皆須竭誠依賴，所以中國建軍，其意義係交識於協力解決中日事變，完成大東亞戰爭兩者之間。日本必須完全信賴中國的協力，殆無疑義。</p>
<p>最後，如果講到百年後的大東亞和平，自然還須要中日兩國永久的協力，彼此決不可以為大東亞戰爭勝利之後，軍事同盟無須談了，要知中日兩大民族為圖久遠共存共榮計，對於東亞聯盟更應緊密加强。</p>

<h3>朱舜水先生對於日本文化的影響</h3>
<p>靜安寺近來提倡宗教文化慈　事業，不遺餘力。曾響應本報助學運動，熟忱可佩。昨舉行第二十六次佛教學衡講座，激講本報社長隊彬龢氏主講「明儒朱舜水先生對於日本文化之影響」茲録戰講詞后。</p>
<p>我們硏究一位古人的思想，學問，行爲，作我們新時代做人的鏡鑑，是很有意義的！</p>
<p>朱舜水是怎樣的人物？這裏，第一應該明白朱先生的時代。朱先生名之瑜，字魯瑛，舜水是他的號，浙江餘姚人，生於明萬曆二十八年，卒於淸康熙二十一年，以公元計，恰是一六〇。至一六八二年，活了八十三歲。這八十多年，正是中國國家多事之秋，由於政治的腐敗，黨禍的繁興，造成了社會的不安，人民的痛苦，結果引起了兩件大事，第一件是內亂，第二件是外息，朱先生是一個有主義的學者。他旣不願意參加黨派的紛爭，又不願意跟流寇作亂，那怎樣辦呢？那時的學者們有三條路，一個是參加政治，那就是上述朱先生所不願走的路：還有二條。一條是「入山唯恐不深的路」那是黄藥洲先生所走的隱而著書的路；一條是「流亡」！這裏又分兩派，一派是學習太史公司馬遷，周遊各地名山大川，以備歸而著書，傳之後世，當時顧亭林先生就是走的這條路；另一派是學夫子「乘桴浮於海」的辦法，到外國去，那就是朱舜水先生走的路。這是研究朱舜水先生思想行爲必須了解的，時代背境和他的出處不了解這些，就不能明白他的言論思想。</p>
<p>他早年便絕意仕進，僅是一位　生，並無官職。崇禎十七年（元一六四四年）明亡時候，他已經四十五歲了。福王建號南京，馬士英要重用他，他逃跑了。從南京陷落起帝被害止，十五年中間，他時而跑日本，跑安南，跑暹羅，時而返國內。他大天爲國事奔走，歷盡種種艱難困苦。他曾和張蒼水在舟山共事；他曾入四明山助王完勳練寨兵；他曾和馮躋仲到日本乞師；他曾隨鄭成功入長江北伐。到最後，他目　大勢已去，只得亡命日本以終老。</p>
<p>當時，日本不許外人留住國內。幸有幾位民間志士如安東守约等，欽佩舜水先生的學問道德，並敬仰先生忠義之心，拜先生爲師，設法破例留他住在長崎，住了七年。日本宰相德川光國上公，是一位好賢嗜學的人，請他到東京，待以賓師之禮。</p>
<p>舜水先生以　旅　困之身，能博日本朝野的尊敬，全靠他崇高的人格。</p>
<p>關於他的人格，我們看他的自白：</p>
<p>「侯生平一無他長，祇此好善惡惡之心，切於肺腑。故明末不肯仕進，耑爲此耳。」——與錩島直　　。</p>
<p>侯事事不如人，獨於富貴不能淫，貧賤不能移，威武不能屈，似可無愧於古聖先賢萬分之一，一身親歷之事，固與士子紙上談空者異也。——答小宅生順書一。</p>
<p>不佞生平無有言而不能行者，無有行而不如其言者。……不佞敢自評：不佞之爲人也，心爲上，德次之，行又次之，文學又次之，而書法爲下。——答安東守約畫十八。</p>
<p>「……自流離喪亂以來，二十六七年矣。其瀕於必死，大者十餘，……是故靑天皦日，隱然有電霆震驚於上。至於風波險嗷，傾蕩顚危，則坦然無疑。蓋自信者素耳。」——德始堂記</p>
<p>看了他的自白，再以他一生的行跡來覆勘，他的確是個德行純粹而意志極堅强的人。他常常把整個人格，毫無掩飾地表現出來，與人共見，所以當時日本人對於他，「如七十子之服孔子。」</p>
<p>舜水先生的學風，主張實踐，排斥空談。他說：</p>
<p>「……浮夸　　以文其奸，以售其術，此小人無行之尤者，而謂君子爲之乎？」——答某書</p>
<p>「不佞於言行之間，但知內不欺已，外不欺人，行而不言者有之矣。未有能言而不能行者也。」——答安東守约書十</p>
<p>「且學間者，亦何必慶時荒業，負笈千里，而後爲學哉？家有母，學爲孝。家有弟，學爲友。家有婦，學爲和。出而有君上，學爲忠愼，有朋友，學爲信。無往而非學矣。其不得共意者，時取古人之　以印之證之。擴之充之，即此是學矣。」——答小宅重治書</p>
<p>舜水先生的這種學風，是王學的反動。所以他論王陽明，說。</p>
<p>「文成多此講學一事耳。」——答佐野田翁書</p>
<p>「王文成亦有病處。然好處極多，講良知，創書院，天下翕然有道學之名。高視闊步，優孟衣冠，是其病也。」——筆語</p>
<p>舜水先生對於宋以來的「道學家」也表示不滿。他說：</p>
<p>「昔有良工，能於棘端刻沐猴……此天下古今之巧匠也，若使不佞……忽然得此，則必詆之爲砂礫矣。……何也？工雖巧，無益於世用也。……宋儒辨析毫釐，終不曾做得一事」——與安東守約醫</p>
<p>舜水先生論學問，以有實用爲標準。所謂實用者，一是有益於自己身心，二是有益於社會。他說：</p>
<p>一爲華之道，在於近裏着已，有益天下國家。不在掉弄盧脾，捕捉影，……勿剽竊粉飾自號於人曰　我僑者也。處之危疑而弗能決，投之艱大而弗能勝，豈儒者哉。」——答興村</p>
<p>梁任公先生在他所著中國近三百年學術史裏，有這麽兩段話：</p>
<p>「有一位大帥，在本國幾乎沒有人知道。然而在外國發生莫大影響者，曰朱舜水。日本史家通行一句話，說：「德川二百餘年太平之治。「說到道句話，自然要聯想到朱舜水。」</p>
<p>「德川二百年，日本整個幾成儒教的國民。最大的動力，實在舜水。後來德川光國著一部大日本史，專標「尊王一統」之義。五十年前後，德川慶喜歸政，廢藩置縣，成明治維新之大業。光國這部書功勞最多。而光國之學全受自舜水。所以舜水不特是德川朝的恩人，也是日本維新致强最有力的導師。」</p>
<p>明治壬子年日本後藤新平男爵爲朱舜水全集作序，也說：「開心眼，通覽上下三千年，一貫我邦史乘奢，端在於他山之石以攻我玉矣。捃摭彼長，採擷人美，咀嚼渾融，以大成我之文化，靡代而無之。……若明季徴君朱之瑜，鄰邦所有之至琛又至寳也。道義則貫心肝，學術則主王業，不得行懷於故國，而卻傳衣鉢於我邦。爲朱明可哭，爲子瑜寗可　也。……縱明室恢復之志不成，而以滿身忠憤之　，寓之一　楠公之　　。燭大　，闡王道。……况於其純忠尊王之精神，磅　　屈，潛默　釀，可二百年，而遂發爲志士勤王之倡　，一轉王政復古，乃至　成維新之大業，以致國運今日之蔚興。我之所得於子瑜也固大矣！」</p>
<p>我們再看日本宰相德川光國上公對於舜水先生的崇拜　敬仰。當舜水先生做上公的老帥時，上公對於舜水先生異常敬仰，時有餽贈·有病，則親自慰問並派醫官診治。舜水先生逝世，德川光國嘆息不已，臨送其葬，親題神主。世子也到。祭文裏有去：「……惠然寓我，我茲師資。終日諄諄，論文講禮。……博學强記，靡事不知，起廢開蒙，孜孜善誘。……生有懿行，死不可無美諡。古言曰：道德博聞曰文，執事堅固曰恭·蓋先生之謂乎，故諡曰文恭。……」</p>
<p>舜水先生對於日本文化的貢獻，從梁任公後藤新平尤其是德川光國三位先生的文字裏，巳可得一個概念。爲了更易於了解起見，再分舉例：</p>
<p>第一，與日本親善，舜水先生寄居日本以後，對於日本人士異常親善，例如在答奧村容禮書裏，有云：「……况不佞視貴國之人，如一家昆弟父子……」</p>
<p>第二，希望日本文化發揚除掉希望明室恢復而外，舜水先生最希望日本文化發揚。在他給日友書札裏，時時流露。例如：</p>
<p>「……不俀足下相與有成，寗惟問學一端而已？將大明與貴國，世世和好之　而貴國文明開　之　，均於此基焉。「答安東守约書」　第三，主張日本　學，舜水先生苦口婆心地勸日本興學。例如：</p>
<p>「建國君民，敎學爲先，……誠欲與道致治，移風而易俗也。……禮曰學則善人多而不善人少。夫善人多，所以興道，不善人少，所以政治。……」</p>
<p>「……昔者滕壤褊小，不能五十里，一旦舉行學校，猶且未能究其功用，而學士大夫至今猶嘖嘖稱之。今贵國……失今不爲，後必有任其咎者矣。至若以風物禮義爲歉者，则建學立師，乃所以習長幼上下之禮，申孝弟之義，忠君愛國，而移風易俗也。……」答加滕朋友書</p>
<p>「聞貴國京江户有設學校之舉，甚為喜之。貴國諸事俱好，只欠此耳。然此事是古今天下國家第一義，如何可以欠得？今貴國有聖學興隆之兆，是乃貴國興隆之兆也。……」—答安東守约書</p>
<p>關於朱先生的生平，思想，和他對日本文化的重要影響，我已大略的說過了，我們在今天硏究朱先生對日本文化的影響，有什麽意義呢？當然，並不是說我們也曾有過這樣一位對日本有助的大師而自驕自滿…也不是以三百年前有這位「親日派」而替現在我們對日本　親善合作作辯護，不是的！我們研究朱舜水先生，第一在使我們中國人注意，在明宋淸初那個混亂的時代，我們曾經有過這樣一位大師，如何不惜圓頂放　的　遊海外，在東亞各國民族中進行敎育與改良社會推進文化的神聖工作，他在這種工作中，無論何時都不會忘懷他的祖國—大明，他這種辛苦的工作，同時也不忘當時的東亞各民族的發展，這也正是當時最進步的民族主義興　界主義者的典型。他這種學問，道德與實踐的配合，就在今天，也正値得我們尊敬與效法的！</p>
<p>第二點，我們從朱先生對日本文化的貢獻，那種眞誠的心情，手足般的友誼，爲日本民挨發展，文化進步而不辭艱苦的精神，實在値得現代的文化人引作模範，尤其値得今日日本人士的注意。無庸諱言，現在中國的文化與日本相較，是落後得多了，我們今天迫切期待着多來幾位日本的朱舜水先生，來扶助中國的文化事業，來發展中國的敎育事業，來提高中國廣大人民的文化水準與政治水準，以朱舜水先生那種視日本人如同胞手足的親愛精誠的態度來視中國人民，多作些積極性的建設性的貢獻，因爲這樣才能恢復中日兩國人民本來的態勢，而且亦是今日共同發展東亞民族的必要條件。我們今天研究朱舜水先生對日本文化的影響，我們在中國老百姓的立塲，熱誠希望日本朱舜水們對中國文化的協力！</p>

<h3>小學組助學金公布　盼即照章具領　大中學生助金不敷尙　竚待熱心人士慷慨解囊</h3>

<p>審核工作手續繁重</p>
<p>關於小學組助金、茲概　辦理經過就敎於慷慨輸金之社會人士、兼以勉獲助各生此後更應發奮向學、毌負各界股望、（一）小學組自申請以迄核准、其間工作日期甚促、而手續特繁、男女青年會各敎師主持考試、及同人之奔走服務、一時該、未敢稍懈、一紙一字、均曾閱讀、學校成績與甄試成績、旣須互相對證、家境狀况、更需確實調查、以小學五六年級八百餘人之申請助學、反覆審查、手揮目送、求共公允、今已勉吿段落、</p>
<p>注意品行關念清寒</p>
<p>（二）審查標準、一言蔽之、「求其獲助而已」蓋常求其獲助，猶恐失之、此同人審查之原則也、亦即體捐款人士之本意耳、至特別注意者有如下各點、（一）對於品行力求嚴格、蓋品行不佳、縱助其學成、於社會將何所補益、（二）助金爲資助淸寒優秀學生、家境較裕者應勿佔家境淸寒者之獲助機會、（三）成績稍次年齡校幼而品行優良父母亡故者、自修旣乏指導、家務多由該生幫理、深冀該生刻苦力學、重奠家庭基礎、故選取較寬、（四）此次助金雖承踴躍輸將、以集款言、不能謂少、依申請名額言、自感不敷、因此凡五年級生成績在九十分以上、六年級成績八十五分以上者、學費均予助足、此外、或成績品行較次者、或家境雖艱、父母及保護人尙堪生產者、均斟酌各種情形、核定適當助金數目、亦有學校學費特貴、而該生成績未能良好品行普通者、酌准一部份助金、此種助金核减原因、其主要點當在不敷支配、然必與各生學行同樣升降、獲得助足諸生應益自勉、未獲助足諸生、應隨時鞭策、以期下屆有特異之成績、</p>
<p>紗業巨子　功不可沒</p>
<p>此次五六年級預定之助金總額、本未能盡副各生之望、嗣承經營紗業之裕記益記慨助兩萬元、囑以對小學生特予支配、以免髫齡失豐、彤響其自立前程、同人秉先生仁心濟世之心、將小學助金名額、特予增抓計約二百名、此二百小學生絃歌不輟、裕記益記實成全之、否則同人愛護有心、棉力不及、社會人士及同人將永永引爲遺憾矣、現時大中學各生、申請名額與助金預算、尙感不敷、希望各界繼起捐輸、使大中學生獲助名額得以增加、與小舉各生、同獲倖運之遭遇、則幸甚矣、</p>
<p>昨收助金</p>
<p>昨日收到助金計劉君四百元、吳婉芳二百元、馬肖馨·肖良·合一百元、蔣照南（經募十五人）一百元、泰隆號　人六十四元、李呂君六十元、沈君（經募五人）五十陸元、帆君五十元、李洽曾·陳德馨·夏盈德·各四十元、鄭定曾三十五元、陳佐臣三十元、方傳曾二十四元、余肇樑·馮和甫·袁鍚如·林筱泉·林德·各二十元、陸君十元、共計收儲券一千三百四十陸元正、前存二十二萬〇七百二十五元七角二分、結存二十二萬二千〇七一元七角二分、</p>
<h3>國府參戰後　文化施策大綱　日使館上海事務所　與工部局敎育處研究</h3>
<p>國府參戰後華中之政治·經濟·文化大爲改觀、關於文化思想及其辦法之大綱、刻由日大使館上海事務所文化部與工部局敎育處硏究之中、其文化施策之目標、旨在中日文化融和、促進建設東亞新秩序、一掃英美式之自由主義敎育、俾可發揚東方文化之眞髓、</p>
<p>國府及工部局所轄之大中小學、已由日大使館上海事務所派去日語敎師約三百名、以國府審定之日語讀本爲敎材、專門敎授日語、然國府參戰之後、僅賴敎授日語、尙不足以促進中日文化提携、並理解國府倡言之同生共死精神、大使館上海事務所有鑒於此、故決定擬訂文化敎育思　及施策之大綱、俾使青年學子能理解自由主義與共產主義之弊害、促進建設東亞新秩序、其具體辦法、不日即將這知各日語敎帥、</p>

<p>本報鑒於冬賑之迫切，期以輿論界之地位，喚起社會各界注意，俾冬賑事務迅速達成，貧苦難胞早得救濟，經即邀集社會熱心人十舉行座談會，關於座談意見，已於一月二十六日在本報第一次發表。此後爲集思廣益，並期取得日本人士之同情起見，邀請友邦在滬新聞界同業，再度舉行座談會，承友邦記者，煞烈參加，表示寳貴意見，至爲感謝。爰亟披露要點如次：</p>
<p>意見彙錄　姓氏筆劃為序</p>
<p>川崎正雄先生—同盟社華文部編輯主任</p>
<p>冬賑問題，不用說是個極迫切的問題。現在物價這樣的貴，生產事業也亟須要振與興，所以冬賑問題，更感得急不待緩了。上海的華人慈善家，都能够踴躍捐助，日本僑民，對於這種救濟　業，當然也極表同情。但是日本的社會上，向　比較安定，所以對於中國的難民問題，或許沒有十二分的起日僑注意，至於具體的辦法：</p>
<p>（一）　和日本當局聯絡之後，再請日本商店照原價或最低價格供給生活必需品。</p>
<p>（二）將中國善士捐助的物品，開一個義賣會，販賣給日僑</p>
<p>（三）在日本電影院及共他場所，設置「冬賑義捐箱。</p>
<p>（四）向日僑勸募捐款。</p>
<p>然而中國方面需要糾織一個上海市貧病救濟協會的統一機關，（編者按本市已有此組織，惟以人民團體性質限於局部工作），負責來調度，捐款　用途，和保管。</p>
<p>照我的意思，冬賑不過是救濟寒冬時期的應急措置，然而在目前的時勢，總要積極的使他們生產才好。在救濟他們之前，先要託當局及保甲方面調查一下，到底有多少人需待救濟，有了一定約計劃，使他們去墾荒，做手工業，那麼比了勸募捐款的辦法史好了。先佈置了做工的設備，擬定擴張計劃，再給予一定的補助金。總之，積極的救濟比了消極的救濟有意義。</p>
<p>以現狀來論，當然是要多多的救濟，救濟社會的末落者，是社會人士的一種義務，中國日本都是如此，所以我願意盡力幫助來减少：「不幸的存在」。提倡組織「中日義賑會」。目前的冬賑，是一個應急的辦法，最好還是趁此機會來組織這種團體，使他成爲一個永久的機關，中日協力之下來推進救濟　業。假使這個組織成立了，那麼就能够讓日本方面做捐款的中心了。關於實際工作的前途，不妨等待這個團體成立了再說。所以希望中日兩國的善士，要及早起來推動，設立這個「中日義賑會」。（雲譯）</p>
<p>日高清磨瑳先生—新申報總編輯</p>
<p>（一）救濟上海難民，不但是一個極好的善舉，我以爲是爭取大東亞戰爭勝利所需要的事情，因爲把上海難民的吃飯問題和職業問題解決了，等於增强戰力，增强大東亞戰綫後方的勞力。</p>
<p>（二）我想上海的日僑對於救濟難民這件事，也都肯出力幫忙的。至於救濟的方法，先要託日文報紙協助，把這種意思披露出來，使日僑明瞭，然後請求日僑所組織的總力報國會，時局婦女會，上海興亞會等各團體協力，那麽相信它的效果必定很大。</p>
<p>（三）和日本大使館上海事務所商量，得到他們的諒解，就請大使館上海事務所喚起日僑同情；這個方法也是很好的。</p>
<p>（四）用那一種方法來救濟難民，還有下面幾點辦法：</p>
<p>1組織救濟難民機關，收容難民，解決其衣食和職業。</p>
<p>2希望需要勞力的機關，公司等等，多多招用難民米做工</p>
<p>3在上海近郊組織模範農村，收容難民，使他們從事耕作</p>
<p>4希望工部局雇用難民夾修築馬路或淸掃馬路。</p>
<p>除了以上幾點，我想還有不少其他的辦法，假使中日兩國人士協力一致，用誠意來幹，相信成績一定不惡。關於救濟難民所需的　費，也很簡單，除了個人慷慨解囊之外，不妨舉行戲劇，電影，音樂會等，把所有收入來充作義捐。（雲譯）</p>
<p>石山基春先生—東京新聞社上海支局長</p>
<p>（一）冬賑是社會問題，故無論如何，是中國的內部問題，不問從來的社會事業是一部分慈善家所爲，抑係英美之政治的欺騙手段之一，現在中國旣已開始進入新的統一國家之途，自必須切實處理今日國家的民生問題，我以爲中國當局對於這個問題，應該喚起由慈善的觀念更進入義務的觀念之與論。換言之，慈善是個人主義的人道主義，而非全體主義，但此種社會事業，是國家的責任，故國民政府及市政府當局（在和界則爲目下之工部局）似非主的不可。若僅訴諸工商界之慈善心，則其動力未必堅强。</p>
<p>（二）對於這個問題，必須喚起日本僑民之注意意，然而，這不過是側面之物質的精神的援助而已。問題的主體，在於中國方面。若此事由日本方面隨便來做，則在實行之際，必有不熟悉之點，反而招致誤會，真意不獲瞭解，甚至釀成安逸的情緒，對於中國之解放更生，同生共苦之國民精神的振興，均屬有害。日本方面應爲之事，厥爲當中國方面乃至工部局遂行此種事業之際，造成使之可能或有利的諸條件，以及努力使其永久持續。</p>
<p>（三）在戰時，安逸是談不到的故欲望如和平時之生活標準及生活態度者，應竭力在精神上糾正。對此而抱不滿者，則失其救濟之價値，而爲社會所棄，輿論指導者非有如此之決心與努力不可。然而在另一方面，最低生活則無論如何非保障不可。此種事業，自有其目標與限度，而動員遊民於生產方面，　爲最要，此生產力應由公共負擔，使有餘裕者負擔爲最宜。故對於奢侈品（縱今是國產）或娛樂，採用間按稅方法，而提出其事業之財源。又以慈善家之捐贈爲其財源，設立財團法人以司發放之事亦可。總之，如現在之個別的慈善，不能統一即不能收全體的效果。故必須聯合此種團體作爲政府當局之外圍在政府統制之下，使緊密連繫。</p>
<p>以上的愚見，太偏於主觀方面，不免是門外煩之談。然而旣蒙囑託，無以奉答，惟恐失禮，故不顧淺陋，隨便寫成，倘可視作參考之用，則幸甚矣。（丁譯）</p>
<p>平尾土荼先生—朝日新聞上海支局</p>
<p>爲東亞民族謀解放之大東亞戰爭，應由東亞民族同甘共苦而完成之。在此大戰爭期間，東亞民族不問是何國人，非忍受生活上的苦痛，集中一切力量於大東亞戰爭的完遂不可。然而所謂共苦，亦應儘可能减少其困苦之部分，故對於生活困苦者，應互相救濟扶助，俾戰爭生產之力，得以培養而繼續。日本夙由政府之施策，及民間之隣保制度等，以行職業之分配，糧食之適宜的配給，一般物資之統制；中國亦已到達應實行此種施策之時期。故：</p>
<p>（一）使保甲制度進一步普及於中國國民性之家族扶助美風，山磷保組織，使有無相通。</p>
<p>（二）政府機關與冬賑團體之運絡，應由政府機關設法急速使其具體化，以有德望之人物爲委員長，設立難民救濟委員會及各馬路分會，而行如左之事。（三）規定日期，舉行賣花，演劇，電影等之義演，義舞（即以舞塲之收入充義捐）。</p>
<p>（四）衣服之捐集，保管及分配等，可就日本現行之方法，硏究採用。</p>
<p>（五）在虹口方面之劇塲，例如大中華戲院等，舉行變戲法·玩把戲等爲主之義演，喚起日本僑民之同情，由此進行募捐及徴集舊衣等。或商請電影公司協力，請男女演員登台表演。</p>
<p>（六）偽引起社會之注意，獎勵含有「東亞之道義與救濟」意義之書籍及文字，與新民運動等連繫，振興東洋固有之互助精神。（丁譯）</p>
<p>海野秀雄先生—讀賣新聞社中南支總局</p>
<p>救濟難民問題，決不是今年的創舉。每年冬天，總有許多　寒交迫的貧民死亡。可是過去始終沒有一個決定的救濟方法，這就可以證明了中國的「某一種特殊性」，看到了許多彷徨街頭的難民和乞丐，使人感到非極早來救濟不可。日本假使有了道樣的情形，是怎麽樣呢？一定認爲嚴重的社會問題，各府縣就要提交府縣會，議員們當做一件很重大的問題來研究。府縣方面先行就地來救濟，就是衆議員，貴族議員也認爲是國家的問題來討論，把救濟難民這件事看做國家的事悄來辦。目下中國是在「革命』的途上，救濟難民，就要當作國家的事業來辦。而且現在全世界都在戰禍之中，救濟難民，已成爲推進大戰的直接對象，，不能置之等閑。我們看見一　鵠面鳩形，露宿風餐的男女，那一種彷徨不安的情形，一時竟懷疑自己的目光不準，難道這就是同文同種的友邦中國的人民嗎？從日本到上海來的人，看了乞丐和難民之多，個個要喫驚的，我曾經員睹過　樣一件事：有一個乞丐，把自己身上穿的一件衣服，拉出一把破棉花，塞到嘴裏，竟當它美味，一邊笑一邊吃。恐怕那個乞丐實在餓得受不住了，所以把破棉花拉來當飯吃了。這種現象，在上海難民裏頭，恐怕不止一個吧！</p>
<p>現在正是空前大戰時期，恐怕這些難民，祇會增加，不會减少的。我以爲救濟難民，是中日兩國國民的重大責任。可是，要怎麽樣來辦才好呢？</p>
<p>（一）集團生活　把難民收容在上海近郊的一個地方，使他們過集團生活。然而道個辦法，並不是叫那些難民去白玩，分別按照他們的技能，分配工作，指導他們維持自供自給的生活。乞丐裏頭或計有不願工作的人，因爲乞丐是一種性格破綻者，所以一天，兩天的指導，不能矯正他們的性格。負責人士，必須要把「不工作的人不准吃飯」的原則，使難民了解。所以，在難民裏頭，要分別等級，在性格上比較沒有破綻的人，和完全沒有用的人，應該隔離；不能工作的殘廢者，收容在別的地力，給他們衣食。</p>
<p>這些地點在那裏最適當呢？恕我沒有到過蘇，浙，皖三省的各地去過，所以不能解說了。但是我想在許多地方裏頭，總有安揷五萬人到八萬人左右的地方，讓他們去開墾來生活，使他們到那種沒有經過開墾的荒地去居住，給他們屋子和農具，或許有很好的成績吧</p>
<p>（二）冬賑經費論理是要國家的財力來負担，但是因爲環境關係，或許不可能，我認爲倒還有一個辦法。租界裏幾百家的舞塲，咖啡館，酒吧間，以及一切非生活必需的遊戲消費塲所，不妨課　一種「冬賑稅」，來充作救濟費用。這種辦法，就算是徴收出入於那些塲所的客人的「人頭稅」也好，就是在那種塲所販賣的物品，不妨微收「間松稅」，也可叫那些出入歡塲的男女來負担一些。再請財政界的要人，慷慨解囊。但是相款沒有定類，所以須要有一筆的款，才能漸次推進工作，把捐款當做第二步，較爲妥當。假使地點和的款有了辦法，就要設立一個公共團體，率管理指導，在　個團體之下，再設一個社會事業團體，喚起民衆的同前心，徴集寒衣，食物等等，歸公共團體來指導監督這個社會事業團體。同時指導那些移居到鄕下去的難民，這種模範性質的農村成立以後，在監督者善意的指導之下，相信他們做出來的米，小麥，菜蔬，和養猪，養雞等等，一定有相當可觀的成績，可以自供自給來維持，假使有一點不足的地方，不妨再請其他方面補助一些。殘廢者收容於像養老院的地方，也用上述的方法來收集經費。</p>
<p>一切的一切，須要有永久的設備，但是最要緊的，就是要把難民和乞丐（我以爲難民和乞丐要有嚴格的分別）的依賴心剷除，培植目力更生的精神，對於工作勤奮的人，要給予相常的報酬，健全他們的儲蓄心。現在的社會悄勢，尤如在夢裏十般，一切辦法都要觀察現實來做。說不定將來進一步可以成立以這等難民爲對象的銀行，和敎育這些子弟的中小學校。</p>
<p>日本僑民，當然也要盡力夾救濟這些難民。（雲譯）</p>

<h3>現實的想像力</h3>
<p>— 寒風</p>
<p>個人如果想發展他的志願，那末他必須善於運用想條力；想像對於人生有着偉大的力量；無論在事業上，敎育上，以及增進快樂與健康上都是一個非常的要素，世界上一切事物的進展和成功，大概是由想像作　引導的。想像並非腦海中的純粹之在想，它是有着現實的根據的。在思想中生長着偉大的模型與功能，而使之可能　實現出來。</p>
<p>今昔世界各國偉大人物所以能够成功，就是因爲他們的想像把握了現實，　策着現實，然後抓住了良好的機會付之實錢，接着便是向理想中的曰標努力地行進；更因想像而使他們對於現實感覺到不滿，因不滿而砥礪他們的雄心，刺激他們上進，使理想終於成爲事實而得到成功。一個人的想像如果是正確的，那末他將夾的志願定能實現，也就是他能成功，如若想像走上了歧途，却能使他遭遇到無窮的災害與黑暗。</p>
<h3>徵文錄取第四名　我今年約計劃</h3>
<p>— 王玉全</p>
<p>利用業餘時間，集合幾個同志，創辦一本定期刊物，　門介紹職業圈　同人的必要知識，硏討職業靑年切身的問題，互作從業員人格的修養，及知識的交換，提供戰爭時代薪水階級生活的應付方式，—一種純粹職業靑年閱讀而由職業靑年自己來創設的定期刊物，這是我今年約計劃中一個重要節目。</p>
<p>由於午時從業的經騐，以及生活上種種不同的感覺，使我深深體味釗我個人的種種缺陷，例如從業學識的不够應付，生活力式的不够標準，同業朋友的不够聯絡……我覺得都須好好的得到當的指導，爲了尋求這種指導，就搜集到專門性的刊物上去，跑遍了雜誌公司，找完全報灘上所列的書報，從米發現到這樣一本足以使我們得到利益的書本，雖然在從前也曾有過熱心人士，爲職界靑年編著過不少專書，並且也有期刋，但現在均已絕版停刊了，這在我們迫切的需要下，實在遇到非常的失望和飢渴。</p>
<p>平時喜歡寫寫弄弄，於是就想自己來辦一個適合職業大衆閱讀的刋物，以補救上述的不足，但限於個人的能力有限；學識的淺陋，更不足以幹起這件負有重大使命的工作，於是就想微求着別人的幫助合作，集合多數人的力量來做起，使這個刊物成爲　母個職　靑年自己的刊物，做文章由大家來做，說話由大家來說，這樣互相公開，互相硏究，共同培植，共同貢獻資料，自己不過做一個編排的人，內容也許不會貧乏到什麽地步。</p>
<p>現在要創辦一個刋物，本不是件容易事，印刷及　張　的昂貴，已成了一般報紙圖書的嚴重問題，何况要新創設一個刊物？但我相信這是我們自己創設給自己閱讀的刊物，可藉自己的力量儘量的節省物力，將成本减至最低限度，有計劃的不使作一點的浪費，選稿須有充份的內容，篇幅要避免無益的消耗，售價只要能合得成本，使每一個薪水階級都有力量購買，經過充份的設計，每月只出一本，雖僅是薄薄的一本，但句句言之有物，篇篇讀之得益，閱讀的人化了金錢時間，可得到多量的收穫。</p>
<p>內容方面，我是這樣籌劃着；</p>
<p>專論　對於工商界最近的發生的變動，値得討論的，予以精確的分析，扼要的許判，正確的指示，使讀者讀後得到明白的概念，根據指不獲得切實的結論。這不一定由我們自己來執筆，可請社會先進人士工商領袖替我們寫，唯有他們豐富的人生經歷，透澈的觀察，才能不偏不倚的從事件中求出眞理。</p>
<p>修眷　清　的文字，也必須由工商業先輩來執筆，處於指導地位來對職業靑年們說話，同時也不妨由外國專書中迻譯出好的文字來。</p>
<p>大眾講壇　這是由我們自己來演講的地方，各人站在本位上，說自己要說的話，報吿自己的經歷也好，研究重要的問題也好，述訴內心衷曲也好，只要是値得公開討論的問題，都不妨在這裏開座談，以期表現大衆的意見。</p>
<p>生活報告　最好是以文藝的描寫手法出之，一方面表現着各人的生活方式，一方面引起文藝的欣賞，同時也可杯這裏容納討論生活的稿件。</p>
<p>從業經騐　各人把自己從事職業的經過寫出來，工作的心得，從業的態度，以及平日所覺到和觀察到別人工作方式的優點與缺點，互作磋切觀摩。有不對的地方，無論是自己的或別人的，要忠實的加以批評。，覺得好的地方，也該予以讚揚與建議，寳　的從業經騐是發展事業唯一的基礎。</p>
<h3>工商名人成功史</h3>
<p>道一種文字，我預備把他殿於書末，常長篇小說看。舉凡古今中外工商界成功的有名人物，怎樣的從　，怎樣的刻苦，怎樣的奮鬭，怎樣的成功，都一一叙述出來，字數長短不計，隨時看　幅　定。</p>
<p>如崇可能的話，我們　可以設工商動態，各業訪問，職業信箱　　。總之我將傾力以赴，使這本期刊在今年出版，同時還希望着職業同人的幫助（按：王君現年二十歲，曾任報館編）。</p>
<h3>用紙尺寸審美觀點補充</h3>
<p>自由談三月三十日刊載楷法比賽辦法，第二項內用紙高度用　造尺計算，按　造尺等於〇·三二公尺，並等於〇·九六市尺。</p>
<h3>達·芬奇的求職書　—世界著名藝術家的書翰之一</h3>
<p>— Ｌincoln　Ｓchuster著　古心議</p>
<p>前因　克拉文（Thomas　Oraven）稱　·芬奇（Leoard　ｄaVinci）爲「人類中最有光輝的人物。」在下面的求職信中，達·芬奇的話非常　直而肯定，的確可以見得其爲人的一斑。他儘可以多說幾句，說他是地質學家，植物學家，生物學家，以及許多其他藝術與科學的大家。</p>
<p>達·芬奇於一四五二年生於意大利離開佛羅稜薩（Florence）數哩的地方，他使「他的一生成爲一個時代—而他的時代便是文藝復興。」范倫汀（Antonina　Vauenlin）曾爲他寫過一本傳說，這是一本關於達·芬奇的最新出而最有權威的傳說之一，在這本傳記中，范倫汀打破了歷來的見解，而給了達·芬奇另外一種面貌，歷來總設，「這人在他的同代諸人中，如火箭那樣，扶搖直上，」而范倫汀却說，「此人艱苦地在黑暗中找尋出路，爲光明與人生掙扎着，作着廣大的夢，眼看着這些夢一個一個地破碎……直到他過了四十歲，他才獲得聲名，而聲名來得這樣遲，已經來不及慰藉他的孤寂或者减輕他對於人類的蔑視。……」</p>
<p>達·芬奇相信，一切東西都是用同樣的基本物質造成的，這話正和現代大多數的科學發現相符合。他想在人類所能成就的範圍內飛翔，造了一架模型的飛機。他的繪畫的完美，最簡單的速寫的生氣，興趣的廣大寫作的豐富，思想的平衡與深奧，在在都使他成爲千古以來傳奇式的巨人之一。他舉生的座右銘—也是他每天的實際功夫—乃是「百折不撓的剛毅。」</p>
<p>達芬奇在三十歲的時候，爲了厭倦和找尋可以從事發展的新境界，離開了他的故鄕佛羅稜　到米關（Milan）去，這時佛羅稜薩在美地西（Medici）這一家的統治之下，已經衰落，而米蘭則在斯福柴（Lodovics　Sforza）的統治之下，正在繁榮起來。下面的信就是達芬奇寫給這位米蘭公爵求職的。</p>
<p>「…確信我的種種秘密」</p>
<p>本文　最有威名的爵主，有些人在發明戰具的藝術上居然成了名家，他們的實騐我已經看見過，並且考慮過，我覺得他們的發明不見得和日常所用的，有什麼兩　，因此，我對於任何人都沒有成見敢於大胆地請求，請求閣下確信我的種種秘密，而給我一個委任。</p>
<p>一，我能够造橋，這些橋都很輕，很牢固，並且很容易搬動，用了牠們可以追逐敵人而打敗他們還有其他更爲堅實的橋，能够扺抗火或攻擊，但仍當是容易移動和安放的；我並且能够燒燬和破壞敵人的橋。</p>
<p>二，在圍攻之中，我能够遏斷城壕　的水，作成浮橋，用梯上城，並且作成其他相同的機械。</p>
<p>三，如果爲了一個地方的位置高或力量大，不能加以　擊，只要牠的基礎不是生在磐石上的，我却　够摧毀每一個礮臺。</p>
<p>四，我也能够造出一種大礮來，這礮是輕的，容易轉運的，牠會猛射和雹子一般的小石子，牠的烟會使敵人大爲恐慌，因此他們會受到重大損失，而陷於混亂。</p>
<p>五，我能够對任何預定的地點寂無聲息地建築地道，或直或曲，都可以辦到，如果必要，也可以從壕溝或江河底下通過去。</p>
<p>六，我能够製造運載大礮的裝甲車，這車能够衝開敵人最密集的隊伍，爲自己的步兵開放一條安全的通　。</p>
<p>七，如果時機未到，我能够搆造大　臼砲，和輕礮，旣好看，又實用，和普通所用的絕不相同。</p>
<p>八，不能用大砲的時候，亦能够供給弩砲，射石機，Trabocchr，和共他大有效用而不大通行的傢伙—總之，如果必要，我能够供給無限的攻守工具。</p>
<p>九，如果戰爭在海上發生，我能够構迭許多最適用於攻守的機械，抵抗得住最大砲火的船艦，並且製造種種火藥或武器。</p>
<p>十，在和平期間，我相信亦能够和任何別人一樣，在建築公私房屋上，在從這裏到那裏的引水工程上，都會給你完全的滿意。</p>
<p>我更很能够在大理石，靑銅或黏土上彫刻，在繪畫上，不論是誰，我可以做得和他一樣美好。還有，我願意負起鑄造銅馬的任務，牠會用不朽的榮耀和永遠的尊貫，來深切地紀念令尊大人和斯福柴這個閥閱世家。－</p>
<p>如果上而所說的各事，誰看來有什麽不可能或不切實的，我願意在你的花園裏或任何你閣下喜歡的地方，實地試騐牠們，對於閣下，我用一切可能的謙恭來推薦我自己。</p>
<p>後果</p>
<p>他得到了職位，在職十六年，直到法國人攻入米蘭，將他的雇主　了去，才停止。…他在一五一九年死於法國，年齡是六十七歲，有着過早的老態。雖然後來的人都稱他爲「萬能的天才」，他却覺得他那「最偉大的科學計劃，還是沒有實現」，而「他對於藝術上完美的追求」也是沒有成功。</p>
<h3>讀「二十四孝」圖　（五）</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>—給我的女兒</p>
<p>莫非古代眷家贍眷的事情，大人不管都該小孩子負責的麼？我的母親雖然歡喜打我，在我小的時候，從來不曾向我要什麽東西吃，倒是她常常買東西給我吃；就是　養她的時候，她也從來不挑剔這樣或那樣。我的母親也並不是生母，脾氣也相當暴躁的，說到這裏，我要以曾經做過兒子，現在正在做父親的資格，向那些編造故事的人們抗議—一方面爲我的父母辯護我的父母決不是像他們所說的那樣，一方面也爲自己的妻辯護，我們在做父母的塲合，也決不像他們所說的那樣。</p>
<p>算大地之大，古今之久，人性大榴又各種各樣，不能沒有多少奇事。比如孟宗王祥被母親打駡得上天無路，入地無門，跑到竹林里哭，河里去找鯉魚，或者是想跳水自殺，孩子們沒有智識，不是沒有可能，只是生笱得鯉是無知的人加上去的。</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Ｈilton著　依今議</p>
<p>「好，你說得也够了，吉賓先生—這就是我所以抱怨的一個例證。你有你的意見，我有我的意見，你旣然不肯　步，那就沒有任　較好的辦法。我的目的是要使勃洛克菲爾德成爲一個完全現代化的學校。我自己是一個科學家，不過雖然這樣，我也並不反對古典—但古典總要有效　敎授着。因爲牠們雖然都是死的語言，却不能說，這就是要用死的敎育技術來對付牠們的理由。我懂得，吉賓先生，你的拉丁文和希臘文功課，現在正和十年前我在這時，一式一樣，是不是？』</p>
<p>吉普斯慢慢地，傲然回答；一關於這件事—呃哼—牠們正和你的前任—美爾德倫先生—來到這裏的時候一樣，這—呃哼—是三十八年以前了。我們，美爾德倫先生和我，是在－在—一八七〇年—呃哼—在這裏開始的。而第一個贊成我的敎授概略—乃是—嗯—美爾德　先生的前任，威澤　先生。他對我說，」你可以給第四班敎西塞祿的著作。一也是說的西塞祿—不是吉格祿！」</p>
<p>『很有趣，吉　先生，可是這話又一次證明了我的觀點—你在以往生活得太久了，在現在和將來就不够。時代是在變化着，不管你究竟有否覺察到。現在的父母，爲了他們所付的三年學費，在向學校所要求的，比了沒有人說的一些破碎語言，還要多些。還有，你的學生甚至還沒有學到以爲他們已　到的東西。去年的初級檢定，就一個都沒有及格。』（二十七）</p>

<h3>Wartime Economy and Suppression of Speculation</h3>
<p>Since the formal declarations of war against Britain and the United States, this newspaper has systematically and proactively offered suggestions on wartime economic policies and increasing production. When discussing wartime economy at this moment, in addition to active efforts and facilities, naturally, there must also be passive measures that complement each other to achieve practical effectiveness. I will now further elaborate on my views as a humble contribution.</p>
<p>The essence of what is generally called wartime economic policy lies in being able to adapt to economic policies during extraordinary periods. Its goal is to concentrate and strengthen the work of various economic sectors, improve the effectiveness of economic policies, and strive for the final victory of the war. Therefore, anything that goes against this supreme principle, anything that has an unfavorable impact on the war, anything that weakens combat power, must be suppressed by extraordinary means. Currently, the most serious issue is speculation—speculation in disguise. To put it bluntly, the evils of Shanghai have always been caused by the rumors of speculators. Especially in recent years, the so-called "extraordinary period" has created opportunities for speculators to seize excessive profits. Ordinary owners of idle funds, because speculation can yield excessive profits, have abandoned the proper investment path and flocked to the evil path of speculation. As a result, on the one hand, it has led to rising prices; on the other hand, it has led to a shortage of materials due to insufficient investment in production. At the same time, the stagnation of the production sector and the increase in unemployment have further reduced the purchasing power of the general public. As a result, not only has it created panic in society, but it has also adversely affected the country's financial economy. In the past six months, although the Chinese and Japanese authorities have repeatedly and severely cracked down on speculation in foreign exchange, opium, cotton yarn, and other areas, the idle funds in the market, unable to find a proper outlet, have instead used national bonds and Chinese stocks as speculative targets under the guise of "investment." Market prices often fluctuate sharply, rumors flourish, people's hearts are shaken, and society is uneasy. This situation poses a significant obstacle to the government's implementation of wartime economic policies. Therefore, suppressing speculation in disguise has become one of the most urgent policies at present.</p>
<p>The Chinese and Japanese authorities already have principles and methods for suppressing speculation, which need not be elaborated. We believe that what still needs special attention today can be divided into two levels: on the passive side, it is necessary to thoroughly implement restrictions. There is no need to explain why the restriction on national bonds must be implemented. Even for Chinese stocks, there should be corresponding measures. It should be known that the current disguised speculation, which takes Chinese stocks as its main body, is not only fueled by general speculators, but also by some shareholders who hold Chinese stocks. As a result, a generation of entrepreneurs cannot concentrate on planning the development of their businesses and must also spend part of their time and energy dealing with the rise and fall of their own stocks in the market. If there is a reasonable price limit, then the storm will lose its opportunity to act. However, suppressing speculation cannot rely solely on passive measures such as controls, price limits, and crackdowns. Greater efforts must be put into the active side. First, the authorities must quickly and meticulously determine policies for the development of agriculture and industry, so that the owners of idle funds thoroughly understand the proper path to investment and profit. Second, the authorities must create safe and profitable conditions for investing in industrial and agricultural production from several key aspects. For example, specially protecting private industrial and agricultural production, implementing a guaranteed interest system for industrial and agricultural production projects, implementing large-scale industrial and agricultural loans, and welcoming private idle funds to participate, giving them particularly favorable profits. Third, the authorities must fully supply industrial raw materials, provide the greatest convenience for transportation, and ensure the reasonable distribution of product markets. Fourth, strict sanctions must be imposed on special classes who monopolize everything with the government or Japanese influence as their backing and seize excessive profits. We firmly believe that the most important reason for the current speculative frenzy is that the owners of idle funds cannot find a safe and profitable outlet. As long as the authorities sincerely implement the above points, effectively protect and guide idle funds into the proper path of production, we firmly believe that the speculative trend will stop without being suppressed. Just like controlling floods, instead of blocking everywhere and inevitably causing breaches everywhere, it is better to dredge on a large scale, which can not only avoid flood disasters but also reap the benefits of irrigation.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to offer loyal advice to those who own idle funds and engage in speculative activities: First, speculation is already a risky business in peacetime, which is not allowed to exist by organized countries. In wartime, this behavior that endangers the country and society will not only be condemned by one's own conscience but will also inevitably be subject to the most severe sanctions of national laws. Speculators must know that the acquisition of excessive profits is accidental and fortunate, while the sanctions of criminal laws are inevitable and unavoidable. Second, we should thoroughly understand that speculation is a kind of gambling. Whether it is national bonds or Chinese stocks, once they become the main body of speculation, no one can guarantee the safety of their speculative "investment." Then, whoever engages in speculation is not only heading for a dead end but also becoming a sinner of the country and society.</p>
<h3>Admiral Dönitz Succeeds Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy; Admiral Raeder Transferred to Naval Inspector General; Submarine Warfare Will Intensify</h3>
<p>Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - According to a public statement issued by the Führer's headquarters, Führer Hitler received the German Navy today at the headquarters, and awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross to Admiral Raeder due to his outstanding achievements, which are closely linked to Raeder's long-term service.</p>
<p>Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - It is officially announced here that the new Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, Admiral Dönitz, will continue to serve as the Commander of Submarines. Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - The succession of the German Submarine Commander as the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy has great significance from a military point of view. Although the German Navy is responsible for various missions, the submarine mission is the most important and should occupy a priority position in the navy. Dönitz's succession as the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy indicates that the naval battle will intensify, and the great war for ocean freedom will inevitably be increasingly fierce submarine warfare.</p>
<p>Encouraging Naval Officers and Soldiers</p>
<p>Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - The new Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, Admiral Dönitz, issued a letter to naval officers and soldiers, stating that he was ordered to succeed as the Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy and would continue to serve as the Commander of Submarines, hoping that all naval officers and soldiers would absolutely obey, be brave and decisive, be loyal to their duties, and achieve victory and peace under the leadership of Führer Hitler.</p>
<p>Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - Admiral Dönitz is 52 years old. Twenty-five years ago, he was captured in Gibraltar. At that time, he was a submarine lieutenant and made great achievements in attacking enemy ships in the Mediterranean. The date of his capture was October 4, 1918. In 1934, he was transferred from the Naval Department to serve as the captain of the training ship Emden. In 1939, he was transferred to be the Commander of Submarines. Within four years, he completed the construction of submarines. After the outbreak of the European war, German submarines had sunk 15,000,000 tons of enemy ships.</p>
<h3>Axis Powers Submarine Warfare Achievements</h3>
<p>Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - In recent days, German submarines have sunk nine British ships with a total of 45,000 tons in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Arctic Seas.</p>
<p>Rome, January 31st, Havas News Agency - An Italian submarine sank two destroyers and one large ship off the coast of Algiers. Another Italian submarine sank two enemy ships near Bougie.</p>
<p>Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - When Roosevelt and Churchill were lingering in Casablanca for ten days, they were discussing countermeasures, trying to prevent German and Italian naval and air forces from continuing to destroy Allied ships on the coast of Algeria. Often an enemy destroyer was escorting a merchant ship and was sunk by an Italian submarine. At the same time, the port of Algiers was dealt a fatal blow, and the number of damaged merchant ships was numerous. German submarines are now active again in the Mediterranean, the Arctic Sea, and the North Atlantic, sinking sixteen ships with a total tonnage of 103,000 tons. In the Mediterranean, many enemy ships, although heavily guarded, were eventually sunk. These ships were loaded with a large number of vehicles and supplies, which were originally intended to be shipped to North Africa for use by the British army, and some were to be transported to the Soviet Union via the Arctic Sea via Murmansk. These sunk enemy ships were all large-scale barges. In the North Atlantic, there were ten large steamships, including a large oil tanker, reaching 75,000 tons. Through the experience gained in this war, the naval strengths of Britain and Japan can be compared with each other. Britain has set up new departments under the naval and air forces, and Japan's naval and air force commander-in-chief is directly responsible to the Emperor.</p>
<h3>Anniversary of the National Socialist Party's Rule; Grand Celebration in Berlin; Goebbels Encourages the People to Support the Führer and Strive for Victory</h3>
<p>Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - A grand mass meeting was held in the Berlin Sports Palace yesterday to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. The brown National Socialist Party uniforms and red national flags created a magnificent scene. However, there were very few German soldiers wearing gray military uniforms. German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels, accompanied by Labor Front leader Dr. Ley and National Socialist Party Stormtroopers leader Himmler, entered the venue at 3:25 pm, and the crowd cheered like thunder. A delegation from the Italian Fascist Party led by Calabini also attended the meeting. Dr. Goebbels' speech and Führer Hitler's instructions left a deep impression on the audience, and cheers were heard from time to time.</p>
<p>Berlin, January 31st, Central News Agency - In order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, a commemorative bonfire party was held here at 4 pm on the 30th. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels attended on time. Before reading Führer Hitler's declaration, he first explained the reason why the Führer was unable to leave the headquarters to attend due to busy military and political affairs. Then, he delivered a speech, revealing Germany's determination to strive for final victory, with the following main points: The British and American propaganda agencies spread various unfounded rumors about the domestic situation and combat beliefs in Germany in order to confuse the world. Little did they know that Germany had made complete preparations. The word "surrender" does not exist in the dictionary of German socialists. The enemy may have realized how firm the German people's determination is. Today, all German people are ready, and their determination to strive for final victory is unwavering. This war is approaching its final curtain, and our battle is not for the glory of the country, but to ensure the survival of the people. Therefore, all German soldiers are loyal, brave, and willing to sacrifice themselves for the country. At this extraordinary moment, in addition to expressing trust in the German soldiers, we should also absolutely trust Führer Hitler. Now the German people are contributing everything to the country to complete the war, and the call has been heard by the leader, knowing that no one in Germany wants a comfortable life, but all hope to do their best to strengthen military equipment. The government will take various measures in the near future to complete the war. All our people should also rise up to eliminate totalitarianism and communism. At the same time, national socialism should also be strengthened and its direction determined. In this war for survival, German people, regardless of men, women, old, or young, should contribute their best to the country. At the same time, we should always remember that Führer Hitler personally commanded the Eastern Front operations under any difficult conditions.</p>
<p>Italian King and Prime Minister Send Congratulatory Messages</p>
<p>Berlin, January 31st, Central News Agency - Italian King Emmanuel III also sent a telegram to German Führer Hitler on the tenth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule in Italy, and Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini also exchanged congratulatory telegrams.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Hitler's Instructions; Incompatible with the Soviet Union; Germany is Fighting for the Entire Europe</h3>
<p>Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels read the German Führer's instructions on the tenth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule at a mass meeting in Berlin yesterday. The German Führer asserted that as a result of the current war, Germany and its allies will achieve complete victory. The instructions also discussed future work, to establish a "German state for Germans" and to protect the European Federation to defend against the crisis in the East. The ideals of the National Socialist Party and the German people are engaged in the current war to await the final victory. In Führer Hitler's instructions, the political and economic situation in Germany after the Treaty of Versailles was first described, followed by the announcement after the party came to power, deciding to unite the country to suppress the crazy emotions at home and resist the oppression imposed abroad. Then, the internal organization of Germany in the past ten years was described in general. Regarding Führer Hitler's diplomatic mission, the instructions stated that if God had not given the power of the country to the National Socialist Party, what would Germany and Europe be like today? The purpose of the massive military build-up implemented by the Bolsheviks was to attack Europe. Since 1941, European countries have been resisting the crisis in the East under the leadership of Germany. However, this should be attributed to the National Socialist Party's acquisition of power in 1933, otherwise it would not have been possible. Under today's circumstances, Europe and the Bolsheviks are incompatible. If Europe cannot achieve victory, then the land of European culture will be ravaged by the Bolsheviks. Führer Hitler also expressed his gratitude to those who have devoted themselves to national socialism and this war for ten years, saying, "The enemy we are currently encountering is still the old enemy of 1914. This war will determine the survival of the people of the country. Therefore, God will always be our judge. We should do our best to fulfill our responsibilities, according to the principle of survival of the fittest, to overcome all hardships. New life will be born from the dead and the destroyed. Our work is here. The spirit of our war will last forever and be immortal. When necessary, we will need to protect the European Federation to defend against the crisis in the East, so that Greater Germany and its allies can coexist, prosper, and enjoy freedom."</p>
<p>Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - A special dispatch from Havas News Agency stated that the German Führer did not personally deliver a speech yesterday because he was too busy with military affairs to leave the headquarters. However, no one knows what Führer Hitler is paying attention to at the moment. Dr. Goebbels and Marshal Goering announced that the strength of the German army will have new developments this spring. The new German army will be better equipped. This is enough to show the world that the German army has unprecedented strength. Dr. Goebbels declared that the German people will exert greater power to engage in the production of preparations. When Marshal Goering mentioned the intensity of the fighting on the Eastern Front, he revealed that the Soviet army has used its last batch of reserves to make a desperate bet. Therefore, the Soviet offensive has shed a lot of blood. The German command will publish the correct figures of the Soviet army's losses to the world. The diplomatic community here expressed deep sympathy for Marshal Goering's remarks, believing that Germany is the only country to destroy Bolshevism. Since the Soviet army launched an offensive on the Eastern Front, the German army on the front line has often been in the most dangerous position. In the German Führer's instructions, he stated that Germany and national socialism are fighting against the Bolsheviks, and are fighting for the entire Europe. Those who did not participate in the war should keep these words in mind, because this war is not only fought for the Germanic nation, but also to eliminate the crisis from the East for European countries.</p>

<h3>Situation in North Africa Unclear; Conflicting News from American Newspapers</h3>
<p>Switzerland, Seoul, January 30th, Havas News Agency - A French separatist news agency in London expressed dissatisfaction today with the failure of American newspapers to report accurate news about the North African incident to readers. Although American newspapers published a public statement issued by the French separatist news agency in the name of General Tugault, they also published a public statement issued by the official in Algiers. Therefore, the news released by the two sides often contradicted each other, making it impossible for American readers to understand the truth of the situation in North Africa. For example, regarding General Tugault's possible appointment of General Giraud as the administrative governor of Algiers or Morocco, American newspapers published no fewer than eight conflicting pieces of news, but never stated which one was true.</p>
<p>Sweden, Seoul, January 31st, Havas News Agency - According to Swedish newspaper news, dissatisfaction with Secretary of State Hull's North Africa policy is increasing in the United States. A London dispatch from a new general compilation daily newspaper stated that London newspapers published a long article cut from American newspapers, which criticized Hull greatly. The "New York Post" called Hull an "incompetent person," and even the "New York Post," which is close to Roosevelt, expressed disappointment with the development of the political situation in North Africa. The newspaper said that President Roosevelt should bear the responsibility for this matter himself and requested Roosevelt to publish a document on whether Churchill agreed with Beaudoin's appointment. The newspaper concluded by asking Hull to frankly tell Roosevelt that the United States needs a document on the North Africa incident.</p>
<h3>United States and Brazil Discuss Naval Cooperation</h3>

<h3>Tunisian American Reinforcements: Axis Forces Tenaciously Defend Positions; Rommel's Rearguard Fights Bravely; Both Sides' Air Forces Bomb Transportation Lines</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch): According to North African news, the Tunisian battle situation has recently appeared increasingly advantageous to the Axis forces. On the 29th, the two armies engaged in large-scale battles in several locations on the eastern side of the Atlas Mountains in central Tunisia. It is reported that the Axis forces have occupied a strategically crucial high ground. Although the Allied forces launched a counter-offensive in an attempt to recapture the high ground, they were repelled by the Axis forces. In addition, the French forces in the area have also repeatedly launched offensives and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Axis forces. Further news indicates that a large number of American reinforcements have arrived in central Tunisia. Moreover, in the border area between Tunisia and Algiers, the British First Army and strong American units are also concentrated. It is said that the Allied commander in North Africa, Eisenhower, is quite anxious about the lack of progress in the battle situation and intends to order his troops to break through the Kasserine Pass defense line and advance into the area from Sousse Port to the southern part of Menezia and the western part of Tripolitania. The Axis rearguard units have repeatedly defeated the vanguard units of the British Eighth Army, preventing their advance. Although a Cairo dispatch reported that a portion of Montgomery's army had entered Tunisia, this claim has not yet been confirmed. Currently, the western coastal area of Tripolitania is completely under the control of the Axis forces. At Buerat (approximately 50 kilometers west of Sirte), the British forces have launched continuous attacks over the past three days, but the Axis forces continue to tenaciously defend their positions.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, 31st (Havas News Agency dispatch): It is learned that the frontline fighting in Tunisia has become more intense today. The British and American Allied forces are attempting to prevent the Axis forces from taking encirclement actions south of Pont du Fahs. In southern Tunisia, there were intense encounters between the scouting units of both sides. American troops, along with the Free French forces defending the area, are preparing to advance towards the coast.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, 30th (Havas News Agency dispatch): According to Axis and Anglo-American sources, the North African front was limited to localized engagements yesterday. The battle situations in various areas are recorded as follows: (1) In the Tripolitania sector, the rearguard of General Rommel's armored units was subjected to fierce attacks by the British Eighth Army under General Montgomery and was eventually repelled. (2) In the Tunisia sector, according to war reports released by both Germany and the Anglo-American forces, only localized battles occurred. The Italians claim that the Axis forces are currently consolidating their positions. (3) Both sides' air forces were quite active. Anglo-American aircraft bombed the port of Sfax, while Axis aircraft attacked the ports of Algiers and Bône. Twelve Anglo-American aircraft were shot down on the front lines, and seven British aircraft were destroyed on the ground at Bône port. Furthermore, German and Italian air forces again attacked convoys between Algiers and Bône. According to the Italian communiqué, one British destroyer and two merchant ships were sunk, and another was severely damaged. Subsequently, another bombing raid was carried out, sinking three merchant ships with a total displacement of 14,000 tons, and two British destroyers were severely damaged.</p>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): On January 29th, at midnight, German aircraft broke through the anti-aircraft fire network of Algiers Bay and dropped a large number of bombs on targets at the docks and stations, causing significant damage. One ship berthed at the docks was hit and caught fire, soon exploding. As the German aircraft flew back, multiple large fires were seen in the port area.</p>
<p>Allied Commander in the Mediterranean: Major Changes Imminent</p>
<p>Stockholm, 31st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): According to a Swedish correspondent in London, General Eisenhower has been appointed as the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean region. This news completely contradicts previous reports. The "Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant" quoted a correspondent in North Africa for the "News Chronicle" as saying that there will be a major change in the Allied High Command. After Eisenhower's appointment as Supreme Commander, his command will establish three service commanders for the army, navy, and air force. General Alexander will serve as Army Commander, Air Marshal Tedder will serve as Commander of the Anglo-American Air Force, and Admiral Cunningham will serve as Naval Commander.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch): According to a dispatch from London, the British government announced on the 30th the appointment of Eighth Army Commander Montgomery as commander of the Allied forces on the Tunisian front, under the command of General Eisenhower, the Allied Supreme Commander in North Africa.</p>
<h3>Voronezh Region: Fighting Intensifies; Soviet General Offensive on the City Remains Unsuccessful; German Forces Successfully Withdraw from the North Caucasus</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch): According to news from the Eastern Front, fighting in the Voronezh region has become more intense in recent days and has become the only fierce battle area on the Eastern Front. German and Allied forces in the area are repelling fierce Soviet attacks on the Novokhoskovo defense line and repeatedly attacking regardless of sacrifices, but the German forces are still holding their original positions. In the lower Don region, the German forces appear to have the upper hand. It is reported that German forces in the southern Don have launched an offensive, defeating Soviet troops everywhere. German forces in the northern Caucasus have also launched counterattacks in various locations. In the western Caucasus region, German and Romanian forces have jointly repelled the Soviet forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): According to a war report released today by the German High Command, the enemy is now concentrating its forces again to launch a general offensive on the German defense line in Stalingrad. The war units in the south, under the command of General Paulus's great solidarity, have already held their positions firmly. The defending troops in the northern part of Stalingrad have repelled the enemy.</p>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): Yesterday, Soviet troops fiercely attacked the northern suburbs of Stalingrad, but were unsuccessful in attacking the factories held by the German forces. More than 400 Soviet troops were killed.</p>
<p>Führer Headquarters, 31st (News Agency dispatch): This afternoon's German war report stated that after a period of fierce fighting on the Eastern Front, German forces are still holding their original positions. Fresh troops have arrived on the front lines and immediately joined the fighting, strengthening the German defenses. The Soviet offensive in Stalingrad is gradually diminishing in scope and attempting to concentrate its forces to invade us. However, the German forces under the command of General Paulus are still holding their positions firmly and have not wavered in the slightest. The northern part of the city is defended by the 11th Army, which has repelled the invading enemy.</p>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): The Soviet offensive has been blocked by the resistance of the German 6th Army in Stalingrad and the German and allied forces in the western Caucasus. German forces are firmly holding their positions in the mountainous areas of the western Caucasus, covering the planned withdrawal of German forces operating in the Terek and Kalmuk areas. The Soviet offensive has been exhausted, and no further attacks were launched the day before yesterday. German-Slovak troops are holding their positions in the western Caucasus, standing firm. After consolidating the positions from the Black Sea to the central Donets River, the German command can now focus on the fierce fighting in the Voronezh region. Elite German units, assisted by tank formations, are advancing northwest from the Donets River area, launching a surprise attack on the flanks of the Soviet forces advancing southwest. The Soviet forces are in a state of chaos. One division retreated in panic, abandoning five 15cm artillery pieces. The Soviet forces also lost 16 tanks. The Soviet forces continue to fiercely attack west and northwest of Voronezh, attempting to prevent the eastward movement of German forces. The German forces are engaged in fierce fighting with Soviet forces that have invaded the German defense lines and are hindering the movement of German forces, destroying 41 Soviet tanks.</p>
<h3>Commander of German 6th Army Promoted to Field Marshal</h3>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): Führer Hitler has promoted General Paulus's rank to encourage him. Paulus is the commander of the 6th Army stationed in Stalingrad. He was originally a colonel but has now been promoted to Field Marshal. In addition, Colonel Schulz, who participated in the Stalingrad operation, has been promoted to Colonel. According to the Führer's headquarters, the Führer highly praised the glorious achievements of the 6th Army.</p>
<h3>Timoshenko's Whereabouts Revealed: Appointed Commander of the Northern Front</h3>
<p>Kuybyshev, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch): After the replacement of General Timoshenko, the former commander of the Soviet Southern Front, various rumors circulated here regarding his whereabouts. However, the Pravda newspaper on the 29th mentioned General Timoshenko as the representative of the Soviet Northern Front. Therefore, according to this news, it can be determined that he has now assumed the position of Supreme Commander of the Northern Front.</p>
<h3>German Military Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): In order to shorten the German defense line in the Soviet Union, the German High Command has decided to withdraw from a portion of the land occupied last summer. The German forces have made this major decision after detailed consideration of the situation in various areas. Therefore, the German withdrawal is proceeding very smoothly. Currently, the front lines on the southern route of the Eastern Front, from the northern Caucasus to the lower Don River and some positions in the Donets-Voronezh region, have also been abandoned. Since the German forces launched their summer offensive last year, their momentum has been unstoppable. Therefore, the further the German forces advance, the longer their rear transportation lines become. At the same time, the Soviet supply lines become shorter and shorter, which is very beneficial to the Soviet forces. The loss of the Stalingrad industrial area is a serious blow to the Soviet Union. In addition, the suspension of navigation on the Volga River has a huge impact on the Soviet economy. Therefore, the Soviet forces are recklessly using their last batch of reserves in a desperate attempt to regain their lost ground. However, based on the experiences of last winter, the German forces are holding their positions firmly, waiting for the arrival of spring, and then using the superior timing to show their skills again. The temporary withdrawal of German forces from a part of the Soviet-occupied territory is regrettable, but there is no need to worry. The German 6th Army besieged in Stalingrad is still resisting strongly. German generals and German-Croatian troops are fighting side by side with the soldiers, sharing weal and woe, and even taking the lead in battle, engaging the enemy in bayonet combat. Their spirit of bravery is such. The fighting in other parts of the Eastern Front is relatively calm. The Soviet offensive in Velikiye Luki has failed and suffered heavy losses. In North Africa, Field Marshal Rommel has already withdrawn from the area near Tripoli. As the Axis forces withdrew westward, the plan to encircle the flanks of the Axis forces was foiled by the German forces. Field Marshal Rommel is now holding the positions in western Tripolitania and has repelled the pursuing enemy. The number of enemy troops who have reached Tripoli is small and not enough to affect the situation there. The Axis forces in Tunisia are very active, and their positions have been greatly improved. In the period from January 18th to 24th, the British and American forces lost 4,000 prisoners of war and 70 artillery pieces. The German people will never be discouraged by temporary setbacks. This is enough to warn the enemy. The recent mobilization measures of the German people are an "expression of strength" and not a sign of weakness. The UK and the USSR have been implementing these measures for a long time, while Germany is only beginning.</p>

<h3>A Record of Inspecting the Soviet-Finnish Front</h3>
<p>— Ureshino</p>
<p>(Yomiuri Hochi Ureshino Correspondent, Helsinki (Finnish Capital), 22nd dispatch): I, the reporter, received the Finnish military authorities' kind permission to inspect the Karelian front for four days. I saw the frozen Kronstadt naval port and the streets of Leningrad. First, I took a train to Vyborg, and then changed to a military vehicle to visit the frontline headquarters near Terioki. Then, I crossed the old Soviet-Finnish border. On the right, I saw Kronstadt. After inspecting the thunderous frontline from the forest, I headed north to inspect the frontline bases in Kakkisalmi and other places on the west bank of Lake Ladoga. The mid-south battlefield from the Caucasus to Moscow is still active due to the Soviet winter counteroffensive, but the Finnish front is relatively quiet, with only small-scale skirmishes. The front line has not changed much compared to a year ago. According to the person in charge of the headquarters, since Timoshenko was recently appointed as the supreme commander of Leningrad and the southern part of Lake Ladoga, he has not launched a large-scale winter offensive. If there is one, it may be launched in March or April, just like last year. However, the Finnish defenses are very solid, so there is nothing to worry about. The war situation in this area may have come to an end.</p>
<p>Finnish Soldiers are Energetic</p>
<p>The distance from the coast south of Terioki to Kronstadt is only seventeen kilometers. In front of Kronstadt Island, there are seven earthen stoves. From the coast to Totleben is very close, less than ten kilometers. Fortunately, the weather was good, and Kronstadt could be seen very clearly. Totleben, in particular, was closest, and with a telescope, the Red Army's movements could be observed. At night, the skating patrols of both sides had minor skirmishes on the ice. Terioki still has the remnants of the summer retreats of the nobles and princes of the Tsarist era. The magnificent villas on the beach have added many bullet marks due to recent wars. Finnish soldiers were laughing and playing on the ice on the shore. The climate here is extremely cold, with only three or four hours of sunshine a day. The accompanying officer told me on the way that the remnants of the Soviet Baltic Fleet are now frozen in Kronstadt. Every night, the Soviets use horses, trucks, and light tanks to transport supplies, sneaking across the frozen sea to supply Kronstadt. After hearing these words, I couldn't help but think of the Soviet newsreels I saw in Stockholm. The Soviet film shots showed, as mentioned above, setting up roads on the frozen Lake Ladoga and partially laying light railways to supply the Soviet troops trapped in Leningrad and evacuate some of the civilians. There is no doubt that light tanks passed on the frozen sea between Kronstadt and Leningrad.</p>
<p>Barracks with Bathroom Facilities</p>
<p>When I arrived at the front line, I felt the tension of the war. I ran to the observation post built on thick ice and could see Leningrad very clearly. Looking through a telescope, it was a silver powdery world. In the vast white, the black mass in the south was Leningrad. Last night, it was bombed by German aircraft, and the bombs hit the target. The snowy night sky added a red light. There is not much contact on the Finnish front north of Leningrad. It seems that the Soviet army has launched a counteroffensive on the southeastern battlefield of Leningrad, which is occupied by the German army. I walked down the observation post and walked towards the hills. The army's barracks were covered by heavy snow. From a distance, it was no longer visible that there were barracks. The barracks were made of wood, each one could accommodate fourteen or five people, with a stove in the middle, which was quite warm, and even electric lights were available. Next to the kitchen, there was also a Finnish-style bathroom. The interior was simple and plain. Many books and flowers were placed on the windowsill, enough to comfort the boredom of the front line.</p>
<p>Women's Activities are No Less Than Men's</p>
<p>In the Terioki front, in addition to the colorful winter frontline scenery, there is also a market operated by the Finnish Patriotic Women's Organization. A separate room is set up in the market for the soldiers to learn songs and entertain themselves. The food supply on this front is richer than in the capital Helsinki, because Finland had a good harvest last year, so there is a surplus of food. As for sugar, etc., although not very abundant, it is not as serious as what is said in Stockholm.</p>
<p>As for that patriotic women's organization, it has a long history. In 1921, Finnish women organized this group to revive their impoverished motherland after the war. It is very active in society, and this group is also very famous in Europe. Since the war against the Soviet Union, its activities have become even more vigorous. It not only makes men free from worries but also dispatches to the front lines. Almost all Finnish women participate in it. The scope of activities is very wide. Just from the above points, it can be proved that the patriotic enthusiasm of Finnish women can be said to be a promising women's army! The general headquarters is in Helsinki. The president is Ms. Raukuna, who is over seventy years old this year. When I visited her, I heard some information about the association's affairs. It is said that there are already more than 300,000 members. Except for special staff, there is no remuneration. In terms of work, it is no less than men, and even dispatched to the front lines to cook, wash clothes, and nurse the troops. Recently, they have also begun to serve as air defense surveillance soldiers, transporting food and medicine. Because Finland has a small population, women are doing their best to help men in non-combat parts. Such a spirit is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Absolute Trust in the German Army</p>
<p>From Terioki, I took a military vehicle to Kakkisalmi on the west bank of Lake Ladoga. The journey took hours, and the weather was extremely cold. My hands and feet lost all sensation. Kakkisalmi was the most severely damaged. After the Soviet retreat in the autumn of 1941, there were only a few residents left here. In the summer, Kakkisalmi and Suurtahtopää on the north shore were the bases for Lake Ladoga fast boat operations. In the winter, Lake Ladoga is frozen like iron. Although I did not travel to Murmansk due to time constraints, I know that the Soviet Union used Arkhangelsk as a loading and unloading port in the summer to avoid German bombing. In the winter, it will reuse Murmansk and try to transport British and American supplies to the inland through the railroad from here to Lisu, using Locke, and Arkhangelsk. Finland trusts Germany very much and hopes that Germany will soon transfer its surplus power to the southern battlefield and penetrate Leningrad from the north so that the Karelian front can come to an end. At the same time, it will cut off the Murmansk railroad and cut off the Soviet supplies coming from the north. It hopes that Germany will exert its power in this regard as soon as possible. This is of course a very legitimate hope. (Transcribed from Yomiuri Hochi, January 25th)</p>
<h3>Remembering Solomon</h3>
<p>— Kogen</p>
<p>(○○ Base Kogen Special Correspondent (Naval Reporting Team) Telegraph) At dawn on New Year's Day at ○○ Base, welcoming its second New Year under the Greater East Asia War, several patrol planes bravely set out toward the Solomon Sea. There is no New Year in war. Now, to thoroughly prevent the enemy's movements, the patrol mission cannot be neglected for a moment. These patrol planes must set out to ○○ nautical miles out at sea, standing at the forefront of the battle line. However, for example, sending the first telegram with the shocking enemy intelligence report "Enemy Mobile Forces Discovered," which became the prelude to a major naval battle, is likely to be only a few dozen or even a few hundred out of the many patrol planes. The rest are all buried under the achievements of the battle, regarded as mere work, and are often forgotten. This time, the reporter was very fortunate to be ordered to accompany a patrol plane, enabling him to witness the hardships of patrolling and also have the opportunity to survey the Solomon Sea, which is attracting worldwide attention, from the air.</p>
<p>Naval Plane Accompanying Log</p>
<p>On the dawn of the third day, ○○ Base had fierce wind and rain, but by the time it was broad daylight, the wind and rain had gradually stopped. However, thick fog prevailed, filling the sky. By the time ○○ Commander gave the order to "Start," it was more than an hour and a half past the scheduled departure time. Between the gloomy rain clouds, a place that seemed bright was sighted, and the plane flew towards it. Perhaps because of the bad air currents, the plane shook violently. At this time, a crew member patted me on the shoulder. When I turned around, he was holding an enamel bowl, full of New Year's rice cake soup, and handing it to me. Because I had already eaten when waiting for the plane to start on the ground, I shook my head and declined. The crew members also seemed to have already eaten, and no one ate this breakfast on the plane. However, this bowl of New Year's rice cake soup gave people quite a feeling of "New Year on the plane."</p>
<p>Coral Reefs Beneath Our Eyes</p>
<p>When the clouds cleared for a moment, islands could be seen below the plane. Last autumn, the reporter had already been deeply impressed by the islands he had viewed from the transport ship he was accompanying. At this time, they were all arranged in dots under the clouds. The winding coastline was edged with white coral reefs everywhere. Furthermore, near the coast, one or two places could be seen that looked very much like farmers' villages. Several parts of coconut groves that had already been reclaimed could also be seen. Besides these, what was seen were various trees, vying for the strong sunlight, growing in layers, forming ancient dense forests. Viewed from the air, Solomon presented a beautiful and gentle natural appearance. However, its reality harbored a terrifying murderous aura, with warships and planes traveling back and forth here. From near ○○ Island, the plane changed course to the ○ direction and moved forward. The islands that had just been seen became increasingly distant, gradually reaching the point where only the island shadows were vaguely visible on the horizon.</p>
<p>Flying Over Enemy Territory</p>
<p>As the island shadows gradually blurred, the plane gradually increased its altitude. Clouds of various shapes flew from under the plane, until it felt as if we had flown over a cloud plain. The captain carefully inspected the left, right, and front from time to time. On the vast sea, not even a single ship could escape his eyes. The navigator, whose hands were free, took out binoculars to observe the edge of the large clouds, because we had now flown over enemy territory, and enemy fighters could be encountered at any time, so such tense vigilance was necessary. The captain's orders came from the speaking tube from time to time, and the navigator followed the orders, tilting the wings to the left or right, placing the aircraft in a position easy to view, ensuring that extremely distant places could be observed.</p>
<p>The Hardships of Patrol Missions</p>
<p>After ○ hours since starting to fly at high altitude, when the taste of oxygen had been fully inhaled, the plane had completed the mission of advancing ○○ nautical miles and then flew on the return route. The reporter, who had been sitting and doing nothing the whole time, felt very tired at this time, and the crew members also inevitably showed signs of fatigue. When I thought about the daily hardship that had to be endured to confirm "There is nothing unusual in the South Pacific," I couldn't help but feel deeply moved. At this time, the crew member patted the reporter on the shoulder again and sent over lunch: rice balls with oil-fried tofu and seaweed, and a small can of beef vegetable soup. When flying near ○○ Island, I saw that the cumulus clouds that hadn't attracted much attention when we flew past earlier had now developed into a gloomy shape. The drastic changes in the weather of the Solomon Sea could be seen here. Using the report of not seeing enemy ships and planes as a homecoming gift, the ○-hour flight was completed, and we landed. At this time, the unit commander came to ask the reporter for his impressions, and I told him that "I came back after seeing islands and clouds and the sea." The ○○ captain next to me smiled and said, "It's good to have only seen the islands." How important is the sea patrol alone in defending the vast Pacific Ocean? Thinking this way, the patrol mission is indeed arduous. (Cai: Translated from the January 17th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Italy Conscripts Women for Rear Service, Now Over 1.2 Million</h3>

<h3>Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the East Asia League</h3>
<p>— Chen Fumu</p>
<p>I have repeatedly pointed out that "the East Asia League Movement is based on the history of imperialism's aggression in Asia for more than a hundred years and is a resistance to imperialist aggression at the present stage." This time, the second anniversary of the founding of the East Asia League China General Association coincides with the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, which makes us feel the profound significance of this second anniversary and the importance of the mission we will bear in the future.</p>
<p>In the past two years, although we dare not say that the East Asia League in China has laid a solid foundation, we cannot deny that our colleagues have indeed paid a price of blood and sweat. Needless to say, our future efforts will inevitably require fierce struggles.</p>
<p>Both China and Japan, after five years of bloody and iron struggles, have come to realize today that "war cannot solve the problems between China and Japan, only consumes the national strength of both countries, and deepens the rifts and hatred between the two countries. This is not in the interest of China and Japan, and even less in the interest of East Asia." Therefore, at a time when our country has already declared that it will fight alongside Japan, our attitude towards war is even more resolute, and our actions in engaging in the East Asia League Movement are even more correct.</p>
<p>The purpose of the East Asia League Movement is not only to solve the problems between China and Japan but also to solve the entire problem of East Asia. For more than a hundred years, the various ethnic groups of East Asia have been under the aggression, coercion, enticement, exploitation, trampling, and sowing discord of imperialists. Their awakening today is undeniable, and their need for unity and liberation is also undeniable. The political ideals of the East Asia League—political independence, economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication—are precisely the concrete demands of the various ethnic groups of East Asia. Only such great and correct demands and ideals can unite the will of the various ethnic groups of East Asia to fight together, and only such a program that is suitable for the common development of the various ethnic groups of East Asia can guarantee the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>In Japan, the East Asia League Movement has caused quite a bit of political antipathy. However, to date, no one has been able to concretely, systematically, and forcefully refute the theory of the East Asia League from a theoretical standpoint. It can also be said that this theory cannot be refuted.</p>
<p>In China, due to the influence of Japanese politics, there are still many people who lack the courage to participate in this movement, and there are still many people who hold considerable doubts. However, "I dare to assert that the East Asia League Movement is the soul of the peace movement. If the peace movement does not make efforts to promote the East Asia League Movement, then it can be said to have no theoretical ground." Moreover, "the East Asia League Movement is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism as its ideological basis. In other words, this movement is a re-promotion of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism."</p>
<p>Therefore, on this day of the second anniversary of the founding of the East Asia League China General Association, now that the National Government has declared war, although this movement is still in a difficult and complex environment, I must repeat once again our belief in this movement. I believe that the realization of the East Asia League ideal can be foreseen, and the following phenomena can be expected:</p>
<p>(1) Aggressive wars will henceforth be eliminated;</p>
<p>(2) All ethnic groups will be able to establish their own independent and autonomous countries;</p>
<p>(3) Economically, all countries will have what each other lacks, use their strengths to compensate for their weaknesses, and establish a system of common prosperity;</p>
<p>(4) Cultural fusion will enable all ethnic groups to sympathize with and understand each other, eliminating suspicion;</p>
<p>(5) East Asia will become a stabilizing force for world peace.</p>

Regarding wartime awareness and all propaganda matters, each county should instruct township and town chiefs and local school teachers to contact each other at any time to strengthen the public's awareness of the times. The Civil Education and Educational Affairs Departments will jointly formulate measures to be forwarded to the counties for compliance.</p>

<h3>East Asia League and China's Participation in the War</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhong</p>
<p>From the East Asia League Movement to China's Participation in the War</p>
<p>The East Asia League movement, initiated in China, has only been around for two years, but the idea behind the movement originated more than ten years ago.</p>
<p>When the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, went north, he advocated Pan-Asianism in Japan, aiming to restore the survival of Asian nations. Unfortunately, the political circles and the public in both China and Japan at the time failed to deeply understand this call, which resulted in the tragic sacrifice of the Sino-Japanese War over the past five years. This was certainly caused by the competition among imperialist powers such as Britain and the United States in China, which weakened China's national strength and led to feelings of dependence and fear. At the same time, it was also due to the failure of China and Japan to be open and honest with each other, making it impossible for most politicians who advocated cooperation between China and Japan to accept this ideal. This cannot but be said to be a regrettable event in the history of the East Asia League. It was not until the National Government moved its capital back to Nanjing and concluded the Basic Treaty of Relations between China and Japan that the two countries gradually realized the inseparable relationship between the Chinese and Japanese nations in reality.</p>
<p>The East Asia League cannot proceed smoothly unless the Sino-Japanese Incident is completely resolved. To solve the China problem, it is necessary to drive the evil forces of Britain and the United States out of East Asia. In the future, East Asia must continue to wage war to completely defeat Britain and the United States, and at the same time, it needs to carry out the great undertaking of building a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Whether in war or construction, the East Asian nations will always share weal and woe and work together.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill the declaration of sharing joys and sorrows and working together, the Chinese government officially announced its participation in the Greater East Asia War on January 9 this year, and signed the China-Japan Joint Declaration with its friendly country Japan. The two governments, with strong determination and conviction, will cooperate jointly in military, political, and economic affairs. At the same time, concessions were returned and consular jurisdiction was abolished, etc. From this, we can see that the East Asia League movement has achieved great success from China's determination to participate in the war.</p>
<p>China's Participation in the War as an Initial Manifestation of the East Asia League</p>
<p>China's official declaration of war on Britain and the United States has aroused great praise and inspiration from the political circles and the public in Japan, as well as the sympathy of countries such as Germany and Italy. According to the East Asia League program, the first thing we should achieve is political independence.</p>
<p>As for the economy, due to special geographical and economic conditions, especially the distribution of East Asian nations in the East Asian continent, each has its own stage of economic development, its own needs and habits, and they support each other. Therefore, economic cooperation needs to be further promoted in the future. Since China and Japan are allies in the war, they should implement the following based on the principle of equality: (1) Materials: to make up for each other's needs and adapt to the balance of supply and demand. (2) Talents: to provide each other with talents to develop the economic strength of each country. However, the scope of the economy is very broad. During the war, most people focus on industry, transportation, trade, and economic control. China's industry has always been backward. It is not an industrial country, but a large agricultural country. It seems that the mobilization of economic warfare is not as great as that of Japan, but food and all raw materials are of decisive importance in wartime. Because the mobilization of millions of troops during the war, its supply and the supply of food for the people are no less important than the urgent replenishment of ammunition. After China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, the strength of China's economic participation in the war should not be underestimated. In the past, Japan's high-profile advocacy of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has yielded little results. There are many reasons for this, and the most important one is the failure to implement the spirit of the conditions for cooperation. Everyone should understand that the prerequisite for economic cooperation is that each unit must have the strength to cooperate. Strength is built by the country itself, so economic cooperation should also pay attention to the spontaneous efforts of each unit country. We hope that after China's participation in the war, China and Japan will sign a mutually beneficial economic agreement. This agreement is completely equal and mutually beneficial, so that the two countries should exert their full efforts in all economic sectors to exert the power of participating in the war.</p>
<p>Again, the military alliance in the East Asia League program is directly related to China's participation in the war. Is China's participation in the war the initial realization of the military alliance? After participating in the war, how to provide strong assistance to the Greater East Asia War, it is now necessary to conduct an in-depth discussion. Fourth, cultural communication is as important as economic cooperation. What needs to be specially pointed out here is that culture is the source of civilization. The East Asia League seeks the coexistence and co-prosperity of East Asia. Therefore, culture should adopt the method of communication, rather than the method of assimilation.</p>
<p>How Should China Strengthen its Military Strength After Participating in the War?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that today's war is a war of technology. Therefore, modern warfare is not only a war between people, but also a war between things, and also a war between science and science. What is the current state of our military strength? We should first conduct a self-examination. After the incident occurred, China's original weak military force has been depleted a lot. Since the National Government returned to the capital, it has spared no effort in building the army. But it is still far from ideal. Since the establishment of a 300 million yen loan to Japan last year, it has been used to purchase a large number of weapons and equipment to strengthen military strength.</p>
<p>Can the new Chinese military equipment share the great responsibility of the Greater East Asia War? We should pay attention to two conditions of the war. First, it must have the strength to assist allied countries in combat. Although the current military equipment is very weak, Japan cannot provide full assistance. Especially for the replenishment of weapons and equipment, there must be a large supply. It is not difficult to train and become a strong army in a short period of time. Second, it must have the military strength to assist allied countries in stabilizing the rear. At present, China's military equipment is not enough to directly fight against Britain and the United States, but China's responsibility for stabilizing the rear is obligatory and necessary to take on automatically. Also, since China's participation in the war, some people do not understand right and wrong, and believe that the participation in the war may be accompanied by a military alliance with Japan, but this point has been formally expressed in a speech by Foreign Minister Chu. I believe that the Sino-Japanese military alliance agreement, in fact, according to the current military strength, only the prior cooperation in stabilizing the rear security, to share the heavy responsibility of the Greater East Asia War, but in order to strengthen China's participation in the war, Japan must have at least the following understanding of China's military construction:</p>
<p>(1) China's military construction is to achieve the conditions for Sino-Japanese cooperation, from maintaining local security to consolidating overall security. In this way, if China does not build its army, it will not be able to complete the task. Therefore, China's military construction should be fully supported.</p>
<p>(2) The issue of troop withdrawal from China is an urgent need to consider after the start of the Greater East Asia War. If the troop withdrawal can be gradually realized, the power of the Greater East Asia War will inevitably increase. The responsibility of troop withdrawal and defense change depends on the completion of China's military construction. The reason is very clear. Therefore, the establishment of the new Chinese army is a prerequisite for the realization of the military alliance, and also a strong guarantee.</p>
<p>(3) Sino-Japanese cooperation is based on the spirit of Wangdao. Both China and Japan must sincerely rely on each other. Therefore, the significance of China's military construction lies in the cooperation in solving the Sino-Japanese Incident and completing the Greater East Asia War. Japan must fully trust China's cooperation, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Finally, if we talk about the great East Asian peace a hundred years later, it will naturally require the permanent cooperation of China and Japan. Neither side should think that after the victory of the Greater East Asia War, the military alliance does not need to be discussed. We must know that for the long-term coexistence and co-prosperity of the two major nations of China and Japan, the East Asia League should be more closely strengthened.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Grain Management Bureau Implements Restrictions on Brewing and Making Cakes</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 31st (Central News Agency) The Suzhou Provincial Grain Management Bureau, in order to implement restrictions on brewing and making cakes and save grain consumption, has conducted detailed investigations on the number of mu of glutinous rice cultivated in each county and the annual consumption. When necessary, for reference, specially made investigation forms are used to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Utilizing Lakes and Marshes to Increase Fish Production, Suzhou Construction Department Submits a Request to the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 31st (Central News Agency) The Director of the Suzhou Construction Department believes that in recent years, fish production has gradually decreased, resulting in rising prices, which has greatly affected the national economy. During the current war, various products should be planned to increase to meet the needs of the war. Recently, it has been found that the lakes and marshes in various counties of Suzhou Province are crisscrossed and should be utilized for the cultivation of various fish fry to increase production and seek a sound basis for the national economy during the war. Therefore, Director Tang of the Construction Department will submit a request to the Provincial Government to first investigate the area of all lakes and marshes in various townships, and according to the size of their area, order the owners to release at least a small number of fish fry within a certain period of time, and formulate incentive measures to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General of the New People's Society Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Peiping, 31st The Secretary-General of the New People's Society yesterday made a statement to the press regarding the 10th anniversary of the National Socialist Party's governance in Germany, stating that the cornerstone of the new European order was laid ten years ago when the National Socialist Party came to power. The achievements of the National Socialist Party in the past ten years have been truly amazing. This should be attributed to the effective leadership of Führer Hitler. The people of China and Germany are now in the same boat. Therefore, the people of the two countries should fight together to build a new world order. We deeply respect Führer Hitler of Germany and the National Socialist Party. We will do our best to mobilize our country's manpower and resources to fight alongside Germany, Japan, and other Axis countries to destroy our common enemy and build a new world order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Trends of Overseas Chinese in Various Places After the National Government Participated in the War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) Regarding the trends of overseas Chinese in various places after the National Government's participation in the war, according to a telegram from Zhao Nan on the 30th, the 3.5 million overseas Chinese in Malaya have completely changed their past concepts after the Japanese army quelled Malaya and Sumatra, and have turned to cooperate with the Japanese army in construction. First, they launched a 50 million yuan donation campaign to show their sincerity. After the National Government's participation in the war, they have a deeper understanding of the path they should take. In the past, they have not been able to fully recognize the strength and position of the National Government. They were deeply moved by the National Government's announcement of the declaration of war and Chairman Wang's declaration of the common life and death of China and Japan. They are willing to do their best to assist in the construction of Malaya. For example, Lin Wenqing, Chairman of the Malaya Overseas Chinese Association, said in a speech that after the National Government's participation in the war, it has given a bright future to the future of the overseas Chinese in the South. We have long been convinced that this move will be realized. Now it is true. We are very excited about this and feel that it is already late. From now on, we are determined to move forward with all our strength to assist in the completion of the war under the great party of Sino-Japanese cooperation. We are convinced that this is the only path we should follow. Also, according to a telegram from Bangkok on the 30th, the 2.6 million overseas Chinese in Thailand were greatly excited by the heroic posture shown by the motherland after the National Government participated in the war. In order to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War, they decided to fight to the end with all their material and spiritual strength under the leadership of the motherland. In order to express their sincerity in cooperating in the war, they sent a telegram to Chairman Wang of the National Government on the 11th to express their supreme respect for leading the motherland to resolutely declare war on Britain and the United States, and at the same time expressed their absolute support for the National Government and their determination to pledge loyalty. On the 13th, they jointly united with overseas Chinese in Malaya, Myanmar, Java, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Japan to strive to smash the forces of Britain and the United States and completely destroy the Yu faction in order to complete the construction of a truly co-prosperity sphere. They pledged to rise up together under the leadership of the motherland and fight until the final victory is achieved. Chen Shouming, Chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of China in Thailand, representing the 2.6 million overseas Chinese in Thailand, expressed his determination, saying, "We now deeply understand the true meaning of the saying 'Those who have money contribute money, and those who have strength contribute strength.' This is the awareness that we should have in cooperating to complete the war. In order to actually cooperate in the war, we are now planning to launch a patriotic donation campaign." Also, according to a telegram from Hanoi on the 30th, after the Japanese army entered northern Vietnam, the overseas Chinese in Vietnam deeply understood the current situation in East Asia. The overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam have achieved remarkable results in cooperating with the Japanese army after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. On the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, they sent a letter to Yu Jiang to urge him to reflect, and sent a telegram to the National Government to pay tribute, stating that the National Government resolutely announced the declaration of war on Britain and the United States. China and Japan have stood on a line to fight together in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. The 50,000 overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam expressed their absolute support for the National Government's participation in the war in this telegram. In addition, the education of overseas Chinese children there is also based on the basic principles of Sino-Japanese friendship, and a new education policy has been formulated. Since Zhang Yongfu, the commercial representative stationed in Hanoi, took office, the unity of the overseas Chinese in Vietnam has become increasingly consolidated. Also, according to a telegram from Saigon on the 29th, the overseas Chinese in southern Vietnam unanimously and enthusiastically expressed their support for the National Government's resolute declaration of war on Britain and the United States. Under the leadership of the Federation of Overseas Chinese Organizations, they united and formed a joint association to support the National Government's participation in the war, and advocated three major goals: supporting Chairman Wang, absolutely trusting the Japanese army, and destroying the Yu faction. They gave full cooperation to the construction of a co-prosperity paradise for Asians. After the National Government's participation in the war, they held two meetings to discuss matters such as the smooth use of overseas Chinese capital. The enthusiasm for loving the motherland is extremely high.</p>

<h3>The Big Cake and Fried Dough Stick Industry is Allowed to Resume Flour Rationing; the Authorities Have Instructed the Association to Inform the Trade; the Noodle and Steamed Bun Industries are Awaiting Reply</h3>
<p>Since the Public Works Department announced changes to the distribution method of flour products on December 31 last year, changing to exchanging flour for products, the noodle, cooked noodle, big cake, steamed bun, fried dough stick, and other industries in this port, because their patrons are mostly from the lower classes, and they are always used to exchanging flour for products for economic convenience, feel inconvenient, so the shops and stalls have no customers and are in a state of shutdown. The association has separately presented its grievances to the Public Works Department, seeking changes and requesting normal distribution to maintain the livelihoods of workers and facilitate coolies to buy food to satisfy their hunger. Now, the authorities, considering the actual difficulties of the industry, first restored the flour distribution to the cooked noodle industry. However, to restrict it, the flour distribution is limited to purchases in the store. Yesterday, according to the reporter of the Da Tong News Agency, the Lianyi Association of the noodle-made big cake and fried dough stick industry also received a letter from the Public Works Department, stating that the request for normal flour distribution for the registered members of the industry has been approved, and instructed the industry to inform all members of this intention. As for the requests of other noodle and scallion cake steamed bun flour product industries, the matter is the same, and the authorities are reviewing the price-limit compliance methods submitted by the industry, and a reply will be given soon.</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhu Shunshui's Influence on Japanese Culture</h3>
<p>Jing'an Temple has recently been tirelessly promoting religious culture and charitable endeavors. It has responded to this newspaper's education assistance campaign with admirable sincerity. Yesterday, the 26th Buddhist Academic Lecture was held, with the esteemed speaker Mr. Dui Binhe, president of this newspaper, lecturing on "The Influence of Ming Confucian Zhu Shunshui on Japanese Culture." The following is a record of the lecture.</p>
<p>It is very meaningful to study the thoughts, knowledge, and actions of an ancient person as a mirror for our new era of being human!</p>
<p>What kind of person was Zhu Shunshui? First, we must understand the era of Mr. Zhu. Mr. Zhu's given name was Zhiyu, his courtesy name was Luying, and Shunshui was his sobriquet. He was from Yuyao, Zhejiang, born in the 28th year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty and died in the 21st year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, which in the Gregorian calendar is 1600 to 1682. He lived for 83 years. These 80-plus years were a period of great turmoil for China, with political corruption, frequent factional strife, social unrest, and popular suffering. This resulted in two major events: internal strife and external refuge. Mr. Zhu was a scholar of principle. He did not want to participate in factional disputes, nor did he want to join the rebel bandits. So, what did he do? Scholars at that time had three paths. One was to participate in politics, which was the path Mr. Zhu did not want to take. The other two were: one was "to enter the mountains, fearing they are not deep enough," which was the path taken by Mr. Huang Yaozhou, who lived in seclusion and wrote books; the other was "exile"! This can be further divided into two factions. One faction learned from Sima Qian, the Grand Historian, traveling to famous mountains and rivers to prepare to return and write books to pass on to later generations. Mr. Gu Tinglin took this path. The other faction learned from Confucius's method of "riding a raft and floating on the sea" to go to foreign countries, which was the path taken by Mr. Zhu Shunshui. This is essential to understand when studying Mr. Zhu Shunshui's thoughts and actions. Without understanding the background of the era and his origins, one cannot understand his words and thoughts.</p>
<p>Early on, he gave up any intention of officialdom, and was only a student without any official position. When the Ming Dynasty fell in the 17th year of the Chongzhen reign (1644 AD), he was already 45 years old. When Prince Fu established himself in Nanjing, Ma Shiying wanted to put him in an important position, but he fled. In the fifteen years from the fall of Nanjing to the death of the emperor, he sometimes ran to Japan, Annam, and Siam, and sometimes returned to China. He dedicated himself to running around for national affairs, enduring all kinds of hardships. He worked with Zhang Cangshui in Zhoushan; he entered Siming Mountain to help Wang Wanxun train village soldiers; he went to Japan with Feng Jizhong to beg for troops; he followed Zheng Chenggong to invade the north across the Yangtze River. In the end, seeing that the overall situation was lost, he had to flee to Japan to live out his days.</p>
<p>At that time, Japan did not allow foreigners to reside in the country. Fortunately, there were several civilian idealists, such as Ando Shuyaku, who admired Mr. Shunshui's learning and morality and revered his loyalty and righteousness. They took him as their teacher and found a way to make an exception and allow him to live in Nagasaki, where he lived for seven years. The Japanese Prime Minister Tokugawa Mitsukuni, was a person who loved talent and learning, invited him to Tokyo and treated him with the courtesy of a guest teacher.</p>
<p>Mr. Shunshui, as a traveler in distress, was able to gain the respect of the Japanese government and public entirely because of his noble character.</p>
<p>Regarding his character, let us look at his self-description:</p>
<p>"In my life, I have no other strengths, only this heart that loves good and hates evil, which is etched in my bones. That is why I was unwilling to serve in the late Ming Dynasty." - To Changdao Naoshi.</p>
<p>"I am inferior to others in everything, but I am not swayed by wealth and status, nor moved by poverty and lowliness, nor bent by force. I seem to be able to be worthy of one ten-thousandth of the ancient sages and worthies. My personal experiences are indeed different from those scholars who talk emptily on paper." - Reply to a letter from Ohtaku Seijun.</p>
<p>"I have never said anything in my life that I could not do, and I have never done anything that I did not say... I dare to evaluate myself: My character is paramount, followed by virtue, then action, then literature, and finally calligraphy." - Reply to Ando Shuyaku Painting Eighteen.</p>
<p>"...Since being displaced and suffering chaos, it has been twenty-six or seven years. I have been on the verge of death more than ten times... Therefore, even under the bright blue sky, there is an implicit thunder and lightning above. As for the dangers of wind and waves, overturning and precariousness, I am completely unwavering. This is because I have always been confident." - Record of Destined Beginning Hall</p>
<p>After reading his self-description, and then examining his life's actions, he was indeed a person of pure virtue and strong will. He often expressed his entire personality without concealment, sharing it with others. Therefore, the Japanese at that time regarded him "as the seventy disciples regarded Confucius."</p>
<p>Mr. Shunshui's academic style advocated practice and rejected empty talk. He said:</p>
<p>"...Boasting and exaggerating to disguise their wickedness and sell their skills, this is the worst of petty people without integrity. Would you say a gentleman would do such a thing?" - Reply to a certain letter</p>
<p>"In my words and actions, I only know that I do not deceive myself internally and do not deceive others externally. There are times when I act without speaking, but I have never been able to speak without being able to act." - Reply to Ando Shuyaku Letter Ten.</p>
<p>"Moreover, what is learning? Why must one celebrate times of desolation and abandon one's career, carrying books a thousand miles, before learning? If there is a mother at home, learn to be filial. If there is a younger brother at home, learn to be fraternal. If there is a wife at home, learn to be harmonious. When going out and serving a ruler, learn to be loyal and prudent. When having friends, learn to be trustworthy. There is no place where one cannot learn. If there are things that one does not agree with, one should often take the words of the ancients to verify and prove them. Expand and enrich them, and this is learning." - Reply to Ohtaku Juji Letter.</p>
<p>Mr. Shunshui's academic style was a reaction against the Wang Yangming's philosophy. So he commented on Wang Yangming, saying:</p>
<p>"Wang Yangming only had this one thing, lecturing on learning." - Reply to Sanoda Okina Letter</p>
<p>"Wang Yangming also had his shortcomings. However, he also had many good points. He lectured on innate knowledge and founded academies, and the world generally had a reputation for moral learning. Looking up and striding forward, wearing the clothes of a jester, that was his shortcoming." - Notes</p>
<p>Mr. Shunshui also expressed dissatisfaction with the "moralists" since the Song Dynasty. He said:</p>
<p>"In the past, there was a skilled craftsman who could carve a macaque monkey on the tip of a thorn... This is the most skillful craftsman in the world, past and present. If I were to suddenly get this, I would definitely denounce it as gravel... Why? Because the craftsmanship is skillful, but it is not beneficial to the world... Song Confucians analyzed things in minute detail, but never accomplished anything." - To Ando Shuyaku Physician</p>
<p>Mr. Shunshui regarded practical use as the standard for learning. Practical use means either beneficial to one's own mind and body or beneficial to society. He said:</p>
<p>"The way to revitalize China lies in focusing on what is near and benefiting the world and the country. It does not lie in fiddling with the bellows and chasing shadows... Do not plagiarize and embellish, calling yourself a sage... If you are in danger and doubt and cannot make a decision, or if you are faced with difficulty and cannot overcome it, how can you be a Confucian?" - Reply to Okimura</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Qichao, in his book "Academic History of China in the Last Three Hundred Years," has these two passages:</p>
<p>"There was a great master who was hardly known in his own country. However, he had a great influence in foreign countries, namely Zhu Shunshui. Japanese historians commonly say: 'The Tokugawa had more than two hundred years of peaceful rule.' When talking about this, one naturally thinks of Zhu Shunshui."</p>
<p>"During the Tokugawa's two hundred years, Japan almost entirely became a Confucian nation. The greatest driving force was really Shunshui. Later, Tokugawa Mitsukuni wrote a 'History of Great Japan,' specifically emphasizing the meaning of 'honoring the king and unifying the realm.' Fifty years later, Tokugawa Yoshinobu returned the government and abolished the domains, accomplishing the great cause of the Meiji Restoration. Mitsukuni's book contributed the most. And Mitsukuni's learning was entirely received from Shunshui. Therefore, Shunshui is not only the benefactor of the Tokugawa dynasty, but also the most powerful teacher of Japan's revitalization."</p>
<p>In the year of Mizune in the Meiji era, the Japanese Baron Goto Shimpei wrote a preface to the complete works of Zhu Shunshui, also saying: "Opening the eyes and surveying the past three thousand years, the key to consistently enriching our national history lies in using the stones from other mountains to polish our jade. Gathering their strengths, collecting human beauty, chewing and integrating them, in order to greatly achieve our culture, has been done in every era... As for Zhu Zhiyu, the Ming Dynasty recluse, he is the ultimate treasure from a neighboring country. In terms of morality and righteousness, he penetrates the heart; in terms of academics, he focuses on royal affairs. Unable to realize his ambitions in his homeland, he instead transmitted his teachings to our country. It is lamentable for the Ming Dynasty, and even more admirable for Zhiyu... Even though his ambition to restore the Ming Dynasty was not fulfilled, he embodied his full loyalty and indignation in the spirit of Masashige Kusunoki. He illuminated the great way and expounded the royal path... Moreover, his spirit of pure loyalty and honoring the king, which was overwhelming and deeply cultivated, after two hundred years, finally sparked the advocacy of loyalist patriots, leading to the restoration of imperial rule and ultimately the accomplishment of the great cause of the Meiji Restoration, leading to the flourishing of the national fortune today. What we have gained from Zhiyu is indeed great!"</p>
<p>Let us look again at the Japanese Prime Minister Tokugawa Mitsukuni's admiration and respect for Mr. Shunshui. When Mr. Shunshui served as the Prime Minister's teacher, the Prime Minister greatly admired Mr. Shunshui, often sending gifts. When he was ill, he personally inquired and sent doctors to treat him. When Mr. Shunshui passed away, Tokugawa Mitsukuni sighed endlessly, personally attending his funeral and inscribing the spirit tablet. The heir also attended. The eulogy stated: "...He graciously resided with us, and we were teacher and student. All day long, he earnestly discussed literature and lectured on ritual... He was learned and had a strong memory, knowing everything. He revived what was abandoned and enlightened the ignorant, tirelessly and skillfully guiding... He had virtuous conduct in life, and it is impossible not to give him a beautiful posthumous title after death. The ancients said: 'Moral integrity and extensive knowledge are called Wen (culture), and steadfastness in service is called Gong (reverence).' This is indeed what Mr. Shunshui was like, so we posthumously name him Wengong (cultured and reverent)..."</p>
<p>Mr. Shunshui's contribution to Japanese culture can already be understood from the writings of Mr. Liang Qichao, Goto Shimpei, and especially Tokugawa Mitsukuni. For the sake of easier understanding, I will give more examples:</p>
<p>First, he promoted friendship with Japan. After settling in Japan, Mr. Shunshui was exceptionally friendly to the Japanese people. For example, in his reply to Okumura Yoshirei, he said: "...Moreover, I regard the people of your country as my own brothers, children, and father..."</p>
<p>Second, he hoped that Japanese culture would flourish. Apart from hoping for the restoration of the Ming Dynasty, Mr. Shunshui most hoped that Japanese culture would flourish. In his letters to Japanese friends, this was constantly revealed. For example:</p>
<p>"...I hope that you and I will achieve something together, not only in the area of learning. But also that the friendship between the Great Ming and your country will last for generations, and the civilization of your country will flourish, all based on this." - Reply to Ando Shuyaku Letter.</p>
<p>Third, he advocated that Japan establish schools. Mr. Shunshui earnestly persuaded Japan to establish schools. For example:</p>
<p>"To build a country and govern the people, education comes first... If you sincerely want to achieve order through morality, and change customs, the *Book of Rites* says, 'If there is learning, there will be many good people and few bad people.' When there are many good people, morality will flourish. When there are few bad people, there will be political order..."</p>
<p>"...In the past, Teng was small and narrow, unable to reach fifty li. Once schools were established, their usefulness was not yet fully realized, but scholars and officials still praised it. Now your country... If you do not do it now, there will be those who bear the blame in the future. As for those who are concerned about customs and rituals, establishing schools and teachers is the way to teach the rites of elders and juniors, and to promote the principles of filial piety and brotherly love, loyalty to the ruler and love of country, and to change customs..." - Reply to Kato Tomoyuki Letter</p>
<p>"I heard that your country's capital, Edo, is planning to establish schools, which is very gratifying. Everything in your country is good, only this is lacking. But this is the most important thing for countries in the world, past and present. How can it be lacking? Now your country has signs of the flourishing of sacred learning, which is also a sign of your country's prosperity..." - Reply to Ando Shuyaku Letter</p>
<p>I have briefly discussed Mr. Zhu's life, thought, and his important influence on Japanese culture. What is the significance of our studying Mr. Zhu's influence on Japanese culture today? Of course, it is not to say that we also had such a master who helped Japan, and become self-satisfied... Nor is it to defend our current friendly cooperation with Japan because there was such a "pro-Japanese" figure three hundred years ago. No! The first reason we study Mr. Zhu Shunshui is to make us Chinese people aware that in the chaotic era of the late Ming, Song, and early Qing dynasties, we once had such a master who, regardless of difficult circumstances, traveled overseas, carrying out the sacred work of education and social reform in the nations of East Asia. In this work, he never forgot his motherland - the Great Ming Dynasty. In his hard work, he did not forget the development of the East Asian nations at that time. This is precisely the model of the most progressive nationalist and cosmopolitanist of the time. The combination of learning, morality, and practice is still worthy of our respect and emulation today!</p>
<p>Secondly, we should draw a model for modern cultural figures from the sincere feelings and brotherly friendship of Mr. Zhu's contribution to Japanese culture, and his spirit of not shirking difficulties for the sake of developing the Japanese people and the progress of culture, which is especially worthy of the attention of Japanese people today. There is no need to deny that Chinese culture lags far behind Japan's. Today, we urgently expect more Japanese Zhu Shunshuis to help China's cultural cause, to develop China's educational cause, to improve the cultural level and political level of the broad masses of the Chinese people, to treat the Chinese people with the same loving and sincere attitude that Mr. Zhu Shunshui regarded the Japanese people as brothers, and to make more active and constructive contributions, because this is the only way to restore the original attitude of the people of China and Japan, and it is also a necessary condition for the common development of the East Asian nations today. Today, we study the influence of Mr. Zhu Shunshui on Japanese culture, and from the standpoint of the Chinese people, we earnestly hope that the Japanese Zhu Shunshuis will cooperate with Chinese culture!</p>

<h3>"Participation in the War and the People" —Grand Gathering of the Greater Light Speech Assembly—</h3>
<p>The Anti-British and American Association of the Chinese Nation held a "Participation in the War and the People Speech Assembly" at the Greater Light Grand Theater yesterday (the 31st) at 2:00 PM. More than 3,000 people attended, including directors of the association, university and middle school students, representatives from the press, and citizens. Before 1:30 PM, the venue was already full, and latecomers could only stand on both sides. The unprecedented scale shows the depth of concern among the citizens of this city regarding the issue of participation in the war and the people. The assembly began promptly at 2:00 PM, with senior executives of the association, Wang Boyong, Liu Hanru, and Li Guohua, presiding over the event. They reported on the significance of holding the speech assembly and then invited the speakers to deliver their speeches, the general ideas of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Lin Kanghou: Elaborated on the relationship between anti-British and anti-American sentiment and participation in the war, urging the public to clearly recognize the crimes of aggression committed by Britain and the United States in East Asia, and to support the government in achieving the goal of participating in the war.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Chen Binhe: Explained that people should vigorously pursue production and economize on consumption during wartime, citing examples of people in Japan, Britain, and other countries economizing during wartime, advising the people of our country to emulate this behavior to adapt to the wartime environment.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Yoshida Toyosuke: Spoke about the changes in the views of the Japanese government and people towards China after the war, stating that Japan has now taken a further step to respect China's international status and hopes that people from both China and Japan will continue to work hard to strive for overall peace and jointly work together to defeat Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>(4) Mr. Quan Shi: Discussed the importance of wartime productivity, stating from an economic standpoint that the production of major products should be increased. He suggested that private gardens and open spaces in Shanghai should be used to plant vegetables and food to reduce the panic over daily food shortages. He also stated that the accumulation of gold and silver by the United States is one of the reasons for promoting world war.</p>
<p>(5) Mr. Zhang Peng: Said that the three major elements of war are competition in manpower, material resources, and intellectual power. China has sufficient manpower and material resources to cope with the war, and only needs to pay attention to intellectual power, promote people's belief in the war, and can naturally defeat Britain and the United States and liberate East Asia.</p>
<p>The speakers all spoke concisely and to the point, and the audience's emotions were extremely enthusiastic, with constant applause. Finally, Chen Yafu, a director representative of the association, delivered a thank-you speech and screened the anti-British film "The Flower Girl." The assembly ended at around 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Relocating Refugee Children - Monthly Cost of Relief and Care in Shanghai is More Than 200 Yuan Per Child</h3>
<p>The Times reports that 40 charitable organizations in this port that provide relief to children are currently planning to send a large number of children they have taken in to various rural areas, especially the villages near Suzhou, as the main destination. The cost of living in these areas is about 70% lower than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Some Refugee Children Have Already Left Shanghai</p>
<p>The China Children's Welfare Association, the largest in scale, has announced that it will discuss this plan in early February. If it is approved, it will be submitted to the relevant authorities for implementation. The Shanghai Relief Children's Charity Organization recently moved to Jiaozhou Road. The organization has already implemented a plan to relocate children. About 50 children were sent to Suzhou by sailing ship three months ago. It is said that the monthly cost of providing relief to a child in Shanghai is nearly 200 yuan, while in Suzhou it is only 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Relief Organizations Distributing Cotton Clothing</p>
<p>The China Children's Welfare Association recently launched a fundraising campaign and raised a total of 100,000 yuan, most of which has been used to manufacture cotton robes and bedding, which was completed at the end of December. These cotton robes are now being distributed to impoverished families living in Shanghai for their children, who have no warm clothes to protect them from the cold. Poor families applying for clothing must have children under the age of 14 and must provide proof and have a guarantor. Only after the association's verification will they be allowed to receive the clothing.</p>
<p>Support for Charitable Organizations Depends on Donations</p>
<p>The association has two shelters in Shanghai, one on Route Lafayette and the other in the Nanshi area. The former houses 110 refugee children, while the latter houses 300. According to the association's budget, it needs nearly 480,000 yuan for relief funds in the first month of this year. Due to this urgent need, the association will launch a large-scale fundraising campaign in March, which will be completed before Children's Day. It is said that without public support in the past 14 years, it would have been difficult for the association to continue operating until now. Also, without the charity dance party in October of last year, it would now be impossible to sustain. The funds raised from the previous dance party were no less than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Year's Charity Champagne Lottery Drawing - Small Champagne Tickets Also Drawn</h3>

However, due to the postponement of the race, it was also announced that the drawing would be postponed. Now, because the club has no scheduled date for the race, it has been decided to draw the tickets according to the Wan Guo Sports Association's New Year's Charity Grand Champagne Race. The drawing was held at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. The winning numbers can be obtained from the club at Luhuatang, Mahou Road.</p>

<h3>Announcement of Scholarship Grants for Elementary School Students - Hope to Claim According to Regulations - Scholarship Grants for Middle School and University Students Insufficient - Still Awaiting Generous Donations from Enthusiastic Individuals</h3>
<p>The Fourth Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Grant has been open for application and registration for 15 days. The selection and investigation of primary and secondary school students has been completed. The elementary school group has been reviewed and decided, and the list of students in grades 5 and 6 who will receive the grants will be announced today and tomorrow. Those who are selected are requested to bring their registration certificates and the seals that match those used during the application process to the office immediately to collect their scholarship grant checks. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Heavy Workload of Review Process</p>
<p>Regarding the elementary school group grant, the following is a general overview of the handling process for the benefit of the generous individuals who have donated funds, as well as to encourage the students who have received the grants to study harder and not disappoint the expectations of all sectors of society. (1) The period of time from application to approval for the elementary school group grant was very short, and the procedures were particularly complicated. The teachers of the YMCA presided over the examination, and their efforts and services were tireless. Every paper and every word was read. School grades and examination grades had to be cross-referenced, and the family situation had to be thoroughly investigated. The applications for the scholarship grants from more than 800 students in grades 5 and 6 of elementary school were repeatedly reviewed, examined carefully and fairly, and now it has come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>Paying Attention to Character and Being Mindful of Poverty</p>
<p>(2) The review standard, in a nutshell, is "to seek those who should receive the grant." The principle of the review was to constantly seek those who should receive the grant, fearing that someone would be missed. This is also the original intention of the donors. The following points were given special attention: (1) Striving for strictness in character. If the character is not good, what benefit will it bring to society even if the student completes their studies? (2) The scholarship grant is to assist outstanding students from poor families. Those from more affluent families should not occupy the opportunity to receive assistance from those from poor families. (3) For those with slightly lower grades, younger age, and good character, or whose parents have passed away, self-study lacks guidance, and the student helps with many household chores, it is hoped that the student will study hard and rebuild the foundation of the family, so the selection was wider. (4) Although this scholarship grant has received enthusiastic donations, the funds are not considered small in terms of the amount collected, but they are insufficient in terms of the number of applications. Therefore, all students in grade 5 with grades above 90 and students in grade 6 with grades above 85 will have their tuition fees fully covered. In addition, those with relatively lower grades or conduct, or whose family situation is difficult but whose parents and guardians are still able to work, will have appropriate scholarship grants determined based on various circumstances. There are also cases where the school tuition is particularly expensive, but the student's grades are not good and the conduct is average, and only a portion of the scholarship grant is approved. The main point of these reductions in scholarship grants is that there are insufficient funds to distribute, but it must be the same as the students' academic performance and conduct. Students who have received sufficient grants should encourage themselves even more, and those who have not received sufficient grants should encourage themselves at all times, so that they can have exceptional results in the next session.</p>
<p>Textile Magnate - Undeniable Contribution</p>
<p>The total amount of scholarship grants originally planned for grades 5 and 6 could not fully meet the expectations of the students. Later, Yuji and Yiji, which operate in the textile industry, generously donated 20,000 yuan, instructing that it be specifically distributed to elementary school students, so as to avoid young children losing their abundance and affecting their future independence. The colleagues followed Mr. Renxin's heart to help the world, and specially increased the number of elementary school scholarships to about 200. These 200 elementary school students continue to study, and Yuji and Yiji have really helped them to achieve this. Otherwise, the colleagues would have the intention to care for them, but the cotton strength would not be enough, and the people of society and the colleagues would always regret it. At present, the application quotas and scholarship grant budgets for middle school and university students are still insufficient. It is hoped that all sectors of society will continue to donate funds so that the number of middle school and university students who receive assistance can be increased, and they can have the same fortunate experience as the elementary school students. Then, it would be fortunate.</p>

<h3>Outline of Cultural Policies After the National Government's Participation in the War - Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office Studies with the Public Works Department's Education Office</h3>
<p>The politics, economy, and culture of Central China have undergone great changes after the National Government's participation in the war. The outline of cultural ideology and its methods is currently being studied by the Cultural Department of the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office and the Education Office of the Public Works Department. The goal of the cultural policies is to promote the integration of Chinese and Japanese cultures, promote the construction of a new order in East Asia, sweep away the Anglo-American style of liberal education, and promote the true essence of Eastern culture.</p>
<p>The Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office has sent approximately 300 Japanese language teachers to the National Government and the Public Works Department's universities and middle schools, using Japanese language textbooks approved by the National Government as teaching materials to specialize in teaching Japanese. However, after the National Government's participation in the war, merely relying on teaching Japanese is not enough to promote Chinese-Japanese cultural cooperation and understand the spirit of shared life and death advocated by the National Government. The Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office is aware of this, so it has decided to formulate an outline of cultural education and policies so that young students can understand the evils of liberalism and communism and promote the construction of a new order in East Asia. The specific methods will be announced to all Japanese language teachers soon.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief Roundtable Conference Convened by This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>Given the urgency of winter relief, this newspaper, leveraging its position in the media, aims to raise awareness among all sectors of society, expedite winter relief efforts, and provide timely assistance to impoverished compatriots. Consequently, we convened a roundtable conference with philanthropic individuals from the community. The opinions expressed during the conference were initially published in this newspaper on January 26th. Subsequently, to gather more diverse perspectives and garner the sympathy of Japanese individuals, we invited fellow members of the press in Shanghai from friendly nations to hold another roundtable conference. We are deeply grateful for the enthusiastic participation of foreign journalists and their valuable input. We now urgently disclose the key points as follows:</p>
<p>Compilation of Opinions (Arranged by Stroke Count of Last Names)</p>
<p>Mr. Masao Kawasaki—Chief Editor of the Chinese Section, Domei News Agency</p>
<p>The winter relief issue is, needless to say, an extremely urgent one. With prices so high and the need to revitalize and develop productive industries, the winter relief issue is even more pressing. Chinese philanthropists in Shanghai have been generously donating, and Japanese residents naturally express their deep sympathy for such relief efforts. However, Japanese society is generally more stable, so perhaps the plight of Chinese refugees does not receive the full attention of Japanese residents. As for concrete measures:</p>
<p>(1) After consulting with the Japanese authorities, request Japanese stores to provide essential goods at cost or the lowest possible price.</p>
<p>(2) Organize a charity sale of items donated by Chinese philanthropists and sell them to Japanese residents.</p>
<p>(3) Place "Winter Relief Charity Boxes" in Japanese cinemas and other venues.</p>
<p>(4) Solicit donations from Japanese residents.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese side needs to organize a unified body, the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association, to be responsible for coordinating, distributing, and managing donations. (Editor's Note: This city already has such an organization, but its nature as a people's organization limits it to local work.)</p>
<p>In my opinion, winter relief is merely an emergency measure to alleviate suffering during the cold season. However, in the current situation, it is essential to actively enable people to become self-sufficient. Before providing relief, the authorities and neighborhood security should investigate how many people need assistance. With a definite plan, they can be sent to reclaim wasteland or engage in handicrafts. This is better than simply soliciting donations. First, set up facilities for work, formulate expansion plans, and then provide appropriate subsidies. In short, proactive relief is more meaningful than passive relief.</p>
<p>In the current situation, it is of course necessary to provide as much relief as possible. Aiding the marginalized members of society is an obligation for all members of society, both Chinese and Japanese. Therefore, I am willing to do my best to help reduce the "existence of misfortune." I propose the establishment of a "China-Japan Joint Relief Association." Current winter relief efforts are a temporary measure. It would be best to seize this opportunity to establish such an organization and make it a permanent institution to promote relief efforts through China-Japan cooperation. If this organization is established, then Japan can serve as the center for donations. Regarding the prospects for practical work, we can wait until the organization is established. Therefore, I hope that philanthropists from China and Japan will step forward as soon as possible to promote the establishment of this "China-Japan Joint Relief Association." (Translated by Yun)</p>
<p>Mr. Kiyomasa Nikko—Editor-in-Chief, New Shen Bao</p>
<p>(1) Providing relief to Shanghai refugees is not only an excellent act of charity, but I believe it is also necessary for securing victory in the Greater East Asia War. Solving the food and employment problems of Shanghai refugees is equivalent to strengthening combat power and enhancing labor in the rear of the Greater East Asia battlefront.</p>
<p>(2) I believe that Japanese residents in Shanghai are also willing to contribute to refugee relief efforts. As for relief methods, first, Japanese newspapers should assist in publicizing this idea to make it clear to Japanese residents. Then, request the cooperation of various organizations such as the Japanese Residents' Total Mobilization Patriotic Association, the Women's Association for the Current Situation, and the Shanghai Asia Development Association. I believe that its effect will be significant.</p>
<p>(3) Consult with the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy to gain their understanding. Then, request the Shanghai Office of the Embassy to arouse the sympathy of Japanese residents. This method is also very good.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the method of providing relief to refugees, here are a few more suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Organize refugee relief agencies to shelter refugees and solve their food, clothing, and employment problems.</p>
<p>2. Encourage labor-intensive agencies, companies, and so on to hire more refugees.</p>
<p>3. Organize model villages in the suburbs of Shanghai to accommodate refugees and enable them to engage in cultivation.</p>
<p>4. Encourage the Shanghai Municipal Council to hire refugees to repair or clean roads.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, I think there are many other ways. If Chinese and Japanese people work together sincerely, I believe the results will be good. Regarding the funds needed for refugee relief, it is also simple. In addition to generous personal donations, we can hold theatrical performances, movies, concerts, and so on, and use all the proceeds as charitable donations. (Translated by Yun)</p>
<p>Mr. Motoharu Ishiyama—Shanghai Branch Manager, Tokyo Shimbun</p>
<p>(1) Winter relief is a social problem. Therefore, in any case, it is an internal Chinese problem. Regardless of whether past social undertakings were the work of a few philanthropists or one of the political deception tactics of the United Kingdom and the United States, now that China has begun to enter the path of a new unified nation, it must earnestly address the current national livelihood issues. I believe that the Chinese authorities should evoke a discussion that shifts from a charitable concept to an obligatory concept. In other words, charity is individualistic humanitarianism, not collectivism. However, this kind of social undertaking is the responsibility of the state. Therefore, the National Government and municipal authorities (and the current Municipal Council in the foreign concessions) must take charge. If relying solely on the charitable hearts of the business community, the driving force may not be strong.</p>
<p>(2) For this issue, the attention of Japanese residents must be aroused. However, this is only material and spiritual assistance from the side. The main subject of the issue is the Chinese side. If the Japanese side does this casually, there will inevitably be unfamiliar points in implementation, leading to misunderstandings, the true intention will not be understood, and it may even foster a mood of complacency. This would be detrimental to the liberation and rebirth of China and the revival of the national spirit of shared suffering and mutual support. The Japanese side should, when the Chinese side or even the Municipal Council undertakes this undertaking, create conditions that make it possible or favorable, and strive to make it last.</p>
<p>(3) In wartime, complacency is out of the question. Therefore, those who desire the living standards and attitudes of peacetime should strive to correct themselves spiritually. Those who are dissatisfied with this lose their value for relief and are abandoned by society. Opinion leaders must have this determination and effort. However, on the other hand, a minimum standard of living must be guaranteed in any case. This undertaking has its own goals and limitations, and mobilizing vagrants into production is the most important thing. This productive power should be borne by the public, and it is best for those with surplus resources to bear it. Therefore, use indirect taxes on luxury goods (even if they are domestic products today) or entertainment to provide a financial source for the undertaking. Furthermore, donations from philanthropists can be used as a financial source to establish a charitable foundation to manage the disbursement. In short, individual charity as it exists now cannot be unified and therefore cannot achieve the effect of the whole. Therefore, these organizations must be united as an extension of the government authorities, under government control, so that they are closely linked.</p>
<p>The above views are too biased towards the subjective and are inevitably the talk of an outsider. However, since I have been entrusted, I have nothing to offer in response, fearing discourtesy. Therefore, I disregard my shallowness and write casually. If it can be regarded as a reference, I would be very fortunate. (Translated by Ding)</p>
<p>Mr. Tocho Hirao—Shanghai Branch, Asahi Shimbun</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War for the liberation of the East Asian peoples should be completed by the East Asian peoples sharing both joys and sorrows. During this great war, East Asian peoples, regardless of their nationality, must endure hardships in life and concentrate all their efforts on the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, the so-called shared suffering should also minimize the suffering as much as possible. Therefore, those who are struggling in life should provide mutual relief and assistance so that the power of wartime production can be cultivated and continued. Japan has long implemented the allocation of occupations, appropriate allocation of food, and control of general supplies through government policies and the neighborhood association system. China has also reached the stage where it should implement such policies. Therefore:</p>
<p>(1) Promote the further popularization of the neighborhood security system in the Chinese national character's beautiful tradition of family assistance, and the organization of mountain forest security to share what one has with others.</p>
<p>(2) The connection between government agencies and winter relief organizations should be rapidly materialized by government agencies, with respected figures as chairpersons, establishing refugee relief committees and sub-committees for each road, to carry out the following:</p>
<p>(3) Set a date to hold charity performances such as flower sales, plays, and movies, and charity dances (i.e., using the income from dance halls as charitable donations).</p>
<p>(4) The collection, storage, and distribution of clothing can be studied and adopted based on the methods currently used in Japan.</p>
<p>(5) In theaters in the Hongkou district, such as the Great China Theatre, hold charity performances mainly featuring magic tricks and juggling, to arouse the sympathy of Japanese residents and conduct fundraising and collection of old clothes. Alternatively, consult with film companies to invite male and female actors to perform on stage.</p>
<p>(6) To arouse social attention, encourage books and writings with the meaning of "the righteousness of East Asia and relief" and connect them with the New People's Movement to revitalize the inherent spirit of mutual assistance in the East. (Translated by Ding)</p>
<p>Mr. Hideo Unno—General Bureau for Central and Southern China, Yomiuri Shimbun</p>
<p>The problem of refugee relief is by no means a new undertaking this year. Every winter, many impoverished people die from cold and hunger. However, there has never been a definitive method of relief in the past, which proves China's "certain uniqueness." Seeing many refugees and beggars wandering the streets makes one feel that relief must be provided as soon as possible. What would happen if Japan had such a situation? It would certainly be considered a serious social problem, and each prefecture would submit it to the prefectural assembly. The councilors would treat it as a very important issue to study. The prefectural government would first provide relief on the spot, and even members of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers would consider it a national issue to discuss and treat the relief of refugees as a national affair. China is currently on the path of "revolution," so refugee relief should be treated as a national undertaking. Moreover, the world is now at war, and refugee relief has become a direct objective for promoting the great war and cannot be ignored. When we see men and women with gaunt faces and emaciated bodies, exposed to the wind and sleeping in the open, that kind of wandering anxiety makes us doubt our own eyes. Are these really the people of China, our friendly nation of the same culture? People coming to Shanghai from Japan are surprised by the number of beggars and refugees. I once witnessed such a thing: a beggar pulled a handful of tattered cotton from the clothes on his body, stuffed it into his mouth, and ate it with relish, laughing as he ate. I am afraid that the beggar was really too hungry, so he pulled the tattered cotton and ate it as food. This phenomenon is probably not limited to one person among the Shanghai refugees!</p>
<p>Now is a time of unprecedented war, and I am afraid that these refugees will only increase and not decrease. I believe that refugee relief is a major responsibility of the Chinese and Japanese peoples. However, what is the best way to do it?</p>
<p>(1) Group Living: Accommodate refugees in a place in the suburbs of Shanghai and have them live in groups. However, this method does not mean asking those refugees to live idly. Instead, assign them work according to their skills and guide them to maintain a self-sufficient life. Among the beggars, there may be people who are unwilling to work, because beggars are a kind of personality flaw. Therefore, one or two days of guidance cannot correct their character. Responsible people must make the refugees understand the principle of "no work, no food." Therefore, refugees must be classified. People with relatively few personality flaws should be separated from completely useless people. The disabled who cannot work should be housed in other places and provided with food and clothing.</p>
<p>Where are these locations most suitable? I apologize for not having been to various places in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, so I cannot explain. However, I think that in many places, there are always places to accommodate about 50,000 to 80,000 people and allow them to live by reclaiming wasteland. Let them live in that kind of uncultivated wasteland and give them houses and farming tools. Perhaps there will be good results.</p>
<p>(2) The funding for winter relief should logically be borne by the national treasury. However, due to environmental factors, it may not be possible. I believe there is another way. Several hundred dance halls, cafes, bars, and all non-essential entertainment venues in the concession may impose a kind of "winter relief tax" to be used as relief expenses. This method can be considered as collecting a "head tax" from the guests entering those venues. It is also possible to slightly levy "indirect taxes" on the items sold in those venues, so that the men and women entering entertainment venues can bear some of the burden. Furthermore, please invite key figures in the financial world to generously donate. However, there is no fixed category for the funds, so there must be a sum of money before the work can be gradually promoted. It is more appropriate to treat donations as a second step. If there is a way to obtain the location and the funds, a public organization should be established to manage and guide the work. Under this organization, a social enterprise organization should be established to arouse the compassion of the public and collect cold-weather clothing, food, etc., and the public organization should guide and supervise this social enterprise organization. At the same time, guide those refugees who have moved to the countryside. After this model village is established, under the benevolent guidance of the supervisors, I believe that the rice, wheat, vegetables, and pig and chicken farming they produce will be considerable and can be self-sufficient. If there is a slight shortage, other parties can be asked to subsidize it. The disabled are housed in places like nursing homes, and funds are collected using the methods described above.</p>
<p>Everything must have permanent facilities, but the most important thing is to eradicate the dependence of refugees and beggars (I believe there must be a strict distinction between refugees and beggars) and cultivate the spirit of self-reliance. People who work diligently should be given considerable rewards to strengthen their savings mentality. The current social situation is like being in a dream, and all methods must be done by observing reality. Perhaps in the future, it will be possible to establish banks targeting these refugees and primary and secondary schools to educate these children.</p>
<p>Japanese residents should, of course, also do their best to help relieve these refugees. (Translated by Yun)</p>

<h3>Outline of Issues</h3>
<p>(1) Winter relief is already very urgent. How should we arouse society to pay attention again? How should we promote it quickly and separately?</p>
<p>(2) How should government agencies, winter relief organizations, and organizations handling winter relief work closely coordinate and discuss consistent methods to strengthen the effectiveness of relief efforts?</p>
<p>(3) How should winter relief funds be raised universally? How should the amount of funds be reasonably regulated? How should relief affairs be implemented quickly?</p>
<p>(4) How should the target of relief be investigated and handled in order of urgency?</p>
<p>(5) How can the methods of clothing collection and storage be made scientific?</p>
<p>(6) How should we appeal to Japanese residents to generously donate with a spirit of mutual assistance and compassion?</p>
<h3>Summary of Key Points</h3>
<p>(1) In wartime, there is no room for complacency, and there can be no peacetime living standards and attitudes.</p>
<p>(2) Relief is a societal problem as a whole and should be handled by state institutions, not just by relying on the philanthropists of the business community.</p>
<p>(3) Government institutions and relief groups should promptly liaise with respected figures in charge.</p>
<p>(4) Japanese newspapers should help with propaganda and request Japanese resident groups to cooperate to arouse the true feelings of Japanese residents.</p>
<p>(5) Japanese residents can provide assistance from the side, materially and spiritually.</p>
<p>(6) Organize agencies to accommodate refugees. Factories and companies, etc., should employ as many refugees as possible, and the Municipal Council should employ refugees to build roads.</p>
<p>(7) Accommodate refugees in one place, live in groups, assign work according to each person's skills, and enable them to be self-sufficient.</p>
<p>(8) Eradicate the dependence of refugees and beggars and cultivate the spirit of self-reliance. Adopt the Japanese neighborhood association system to share what one has with others.</p>
<p>(10) Sources of funding should be taxes on dance halls, cafes, bars, and all non-essential consumer venues in Shanghai—a "winter relief tax," "head tax," and "indirect tax." Furthermore, financial figures should be asked to generously donate.</p>
<p>(10)(1) Hold charity performances such as flower sales, plays, and movies, as well as charity dances in dance halls, with the income used as expenses.</p>

<h3>Realistic Imagination</h3>
<p>— Cold Wind</p>
<p>If an individual wants to develop his ambitions, then he must be good at using imagination. Imagination has a great power for life. Whether in business, education, as well as increasing happiness and health, it is an extraordinary element. The progress and success of everything in the world are probably guided by imagination. Imagination is not a purely empty thought in the mind, it has a realistic basis. Great models and functions grow in thought, making it possible to realize them.</p>
<p>The reason why great figures in various countries in the world today and in the past were able to succeed is because their imaginations grasped reality, spurred reality, and then seized good opportunities and put them into practice. Then, they worked hard towards the ideal goal. Because of imagination, they felt dissatisfied with reality, and because of dissatisfaction, they honed their ambitions and stimulated their advancement, so that the ideal finally became a reality and they achieved success. If a person's imagination is correct, then his ambitions will surely be realized, that is, he can succeed. If imagination goes astray, it can cause him endless disasters and darkness.</p>
<h3>4th Place Winning Essay: My Plan for This Year</h3>
<p>— Wang Yuquan</p>
<p>Using spare time, gather a few comrades to start a regular publication, specializing in introducing necessary knowledge to colleagues in the professional circle, discussing the personal problems of professional youth, cultivating the personality of employees, and exchanging knowledge. It provides ways for salaried people to cope with wartime life—a regular publication purely for professional youth to read and created by professional youth themselves. This is an important program in my plan for this year.</p>
<p>Due to the experience of working at noon, as well as various feelings in life, I deeply realized my various shortcomings, such as insufficient professional knowledge, insufficient living methods, insufficient contact with colleagues… I felt that I needed proper guidance. In order to seek this guidance, I collected specialized publications. I ran through magazine companies and searched all the newspapers and books listed on the newsstands. I have not found such a book that can benefit us. Although in the past there were enthusiastic people who compiled many special books for professional youth, and there were also periodicals, they are now out of print. This is a very disappointing and hungry situation under our urgent needs.</p>
<p>I usually like to write and fiddle around, so I wanted to run a publication suitable for the reading of the professional public, to remedy the above shortcomings. But limited by my personal limited ability and shallow knowledge, I am even more unable to do this work with a major mission. So I wanted to seek help and cooperation from others, and gather the power of the majority to do it, so that this publication can become a publication of every professional youth. Everyone can write articles, everyone can speak, so that they can be open to each other, research each other, cultivate together, and contribute data together. I am just an arranger. The content may not be so poor.</p>
<p>It is not easy to start a publication now. The high cost of printing and paper has become a serious problem for general newspapers and books, let alone starting a new publication? But I believe that this is a publication that we create ourselves for ourselves to read. We can save materials as much as possible with our own efforts and reduce the cost to the lowest possible limit. We plan not to waste a single point. The selected manuscripts must have sufficient content, and the length should avoid useless waste. The price should only be affordable for every salary class. After sufficient design, only one issue will be published each month. Although it is only a thin one, every sentence is meaningful, and every article is beneficial to read. People who spend money and time on reading can get a large amount of harvest.</p>
<p>In terms of content, I am planning like this:</p>
<p>Special Articles: For the latest changes in the business community that are worth discussing, give precise analysis, succinct judgment, and correct instructions, so that readers can get a clear concept after reading and get practical conclusions based on the instructions. This does not have to be written by ourselves, we can ask social advanced people and business leaders to write for us. Only their rich life experience and thorough observation can seek the truth from the incident impartially.</p>
<p>Cultivation: The clear and touching writing must also be written by the predecessors in the industry and commerce, and speak to the professional youth from a guiding position. At the same time, it is also possible to translate good writings from foreign specialized books.</p>
<p>Public Forum: This is a place for us to give speeches. Each person stands on their position and says what they want to say. It is okay to report their own experiences, study important issues, or tell their inner feelings. As long as the issue is worth discussing publicly, it is possible to hold a forum here to express the opinions of the public.</p>
<p>Life Report: It is best to use literary description techniques to express each person's lifestyle, arouse literary appreciation, and also accommodate manuscripts discussing life.</p>
<p>Professional Experience: Each person writes about their professional experience, the experience of work, the attitude of employment, and the advantages and disadvantages of other people's work methods that they usually feel and observe. Learn from each other. If there are wrong places, whether their own or someone else's, they should be criticized honestly. If they feel good, they should also be praised and suggested. Valuable professional experience is the only foundation for developing a career.</p>
<h3>History of Success of Famous Industrial and Commercial Figures</h3>
<p>I plan to place this kind of text at the end of the book and treat it as a long novel. All the famous figures who have succeeded in the industrial and commercial circles at home and abroad, how they started, how they worked hard, how they struggled, and how they succeeded, are described one by one, regardless of the length of the number of words, depending on the size of the layout.</p>
<p>If possible, we can also set up industry and commerce trends, industry visits, and professional mailboxes. In short, I will devote all my efforts to publish this periodical this year, and I also hope for the help of my colleagues in the profession (Note: Mr. Wang is now twenty years old and used to work as a editor in a newspaper office).</p>
<h3>Supplement to Paper Size Aesthetic Point of View</h3>
<p>The method of the standard script competition published in the Free Talk on March 30th, the height of the paper in the second item is calculated by the construction ruler, according to the construction ruler is equal to 0.32 meters, and is equal to 0.96 city ruler.</p>
<h3>Leonardo da Vinci's Job Application — One of the Letters of World-Renowned Artists</h3>
<p>— Written by Lincoln Schuster, Translated by Gu Xin</p>
<p>Background: Thomas Craven called Leonardo da Vinci "the most brilliant figure in mankind." In the following job application letter, da Vinci's words are very direct and assertive, indeed reflecting his character. He could have said more, stating that he was a geologist, botanist, biologist, and master of many other arts and sciences.</p>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci was born in 1452 in Italy, a few miles from Florence. He made "his life an era—and his era was the Renaissance." Antonina Vallentin wrote a biography of him, one of the newest and most authoritative accounts of da Vinci. In this biography, Vallentin broke with traditional views and presented da Vinci in a different light. Traditionally, it was assumed, "This man, among his contemporaries, soared like a rocket," but Vallentin said, "This man struggled in the dark to find a way out, fighting for light and life, dreaming grand dreams, watching these dreams shatter one by one... It wasn't until he was over forty that he gained fame, and this fame came so late that it was too late to comfort his loneliness or alleviate his contempt for humanity..."</p>
<p>Da Vinci believed that everything was made of the same basic substance, which aligns with most modern scientific discoveries. He wanted to fly within the realm of human achievement and built a model airplane. The perfection of his paintings, the vitality of his simplest sketches, the breadth of his interests, the richness of his writing, and the balance and depth of his thoughts all made him one of the legendary giants of all time. His life motto—also his daily practice—was "unyielding perseverance."</p>
<p>At the age of thirty, Leonardo da Vinci, weary and seeking new frontiers for development, left his hometown of Florence for Milan. At this time, Florence, under the rule of the Medici family, was in decline, while Milan, under the rule of Lodovico Sforza, was prospering. The following letter is da Vinci's job application to the Duke of Milan.</p>
<p>"...Assure Yourself of My Secrets"</p>
<p>Text: Most Illustrious Lord, some have become renowned in the art of inventing war machines. I have seen and considered their experiments, and I do not find their inventions much different from those used daily. Therefore, I have no prejudice against anyone and boldly request that Your Excellency assure yourself of my secrets and grant me a commission.</p>
<p>First, I can build bridges that are light, strong, and easy to move. With them, you can pursue and defeat enemies. There are also other more solid bridges that can resist fire or attack, but are still easy to move and place; and I can also burn and destroy enemy bridges.</p>
<p>Second, in sieges, I can cut off the water in moats, create pontoon bridges, scale walls with ladders, and create other similar machines.</p>
<p>Third, if a place cannot be attacked because of its high position or great strength, but its foundations are not on bedrock, I can destroy every fortress.</p>
<p>Fourth, I can also build a large cannon that is light and easy to transport. It will fire rapidly and like hail small stones. Its smoke will greatly terrify the enemy, causing them significant losses and throwing them into chaos.</p>
<p>Fifth, I can build tunnels silently to any predetermined location, straight or curved, as needed, and even pass under trenches or rivers.</p>
<p>Sixth, I can manufacture armored vehicles to carry large cannons. These vehicles can break through the enemy's most concentrated ranks, opening a safe passage for our infantry.</p>
<p>Seventh, if the time is not right, I can construct beautiful and practical mortars and light cannons, unlike those commonly used.</p>
<p>Eighth, when cannons cannot be used, I can also supply crossbows, catapults, trabocchi, and other highly effective but less common devices—in short, if necessary, I can provide an unlimited supply of tools for offense and defense.</p>
<p>Ninth, if war breaks out at sea, I can design many of the most suitable machines for offense and defense, warships that can withstand the greatest firepower, and manufacture various explosives and weapons.</p>
<p>Tenth, in peacetime, I believe I can provide complete satisfaction in the construction of public and private buildings, and in water diversion projects from here to there, as well as anyone else.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I am very capable of sculpting in marble, bronze, or clay. In painting, I can do as well as anyone. Also, I would like to take on the task of casting a bronze horse, which will deeply commemorate your late father and the Sforza family with immortal glory and eternal honor.</p>
<p>If anyone sees anything impossible or impractical in the above, I am willing to test them in your garden or any place your Excellency prefers. With all possible humility, I recommend myself to Your Excellency.</p>
<p>Aftermath</p>
<p>He got the job and held it for sixteen years until the French invaded Milan and dismissed his employer. He died in France in 1519 at the age of sixty-seven, with premature signs of aging. Although later generations called him a "universal genius," he felt that his "greatest scientific plans were not realized" and that "his pursuit of artistic perfection" was also unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Reading the Pictures of "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" (5)</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>—To My Daughter</p>
<p>Could it be that matters of filial piety in ancient families were the responsibility of children, regardless of whether adults were involved? Although my mother liked to hit me, she never asked me for anything to eat when I was young; instead, she often bought things for me to eat. Even when I was taking care of her, she never complained about this or that. My mother was not even my biological mother, and she had a rather volatile temper. Speaking of which, I want to protest to those who fabricate stories in my capacity as someone who has been a son and is now a father—on the one hand, to defend my parents, who were certainly not as they describe them, and on the other hand, to defend my own wife, as we as parents are certainly not as they describe us either.</p>
<p>Considering the vastness of the earth and the long history of ancient and modern times, human nature is diverse and varied, and there must be many strange things. For example, Meng Zong and Wang Xiang were scolded and beaten by their mothers to the point where they had no way to go to heaven or earth, so they ran to the bamboo forest to cry, or to the river to find carp, or even thought of drowning themselves. Children may lack knowledge, which is not impossible, but catching carp in winter is something ignorant people have added.</p>
<h3>Teacher for All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>"Very well, you've said enough, Mr. Chipping—that's an example of what I'm complaining about. You have your opinions, and I have mine, and since you won't budge, there's no better way. My aim is to make Brookfield a fully modern school. I am a scientist myself, but even so, I'm not against the classics—but the classics must be effectively taught. Just because they are dead languages doesn't mean that's a reason to treat them with dead educational techniques. I understand, Mr. Chipping, that your Latin and Greek lessons are exactly the same now as they were ten years ago when I was here, aren't they?"</p>
<p>Chips replied slowly and proudly; "On that point—ahem—they are exactly the same as when your predecessor—Mr. Meldrum—came here, that—ahem—was thirty-eight years ago. We, Mr. Meldrum and I, started here in—in—1870—ahem. And the first to approve of my teaching outline—was—um—Mr. Meldrum's predecessor, Mr. Weatherley. He said to me, 'You can teach Cicero's works to the Fourth Form.' It's Cicero—not Kickero!'"</p>
<p>"Very interesting, Mr. Chips, but that proves my point once again—you have lived too long in the past and not enough in the present and future. Times are changing, whether you've noticed it or not. Parents now demand more from the school for the three years of fees they pay than some broken languages that no one speaks. Besides, your students haven't even learned what they think they have. None of them passed the junior certificate last year." (27)</p>

<h3>The Newspaper's Social Service Department Establishes Small Loan Fund for the Poor</h3>
<p>At a time when industry and commerce are showing signs of recovery, the number of unemployed is increasing daily. With the soaring prices of goods, the poor are finding it difficult to make a living, and their situation is becoming increasingly dire. If assistance is not provided promptly, they may starve. This newspaper, in accordance with the wishes of its readers, is striving to do its part and dares not lag behind. In addition to vigorously supporting winter relief efforts by providing porridge and clothing to shelter from the cold, we have recently established a small loan fund to help the poor become self-reliant and avoid desperation or resorting to illegal activities. We have gradually received donations totaling ten thousand yuan, which will serve as the foundation for the small loan fund. Loans will be interest-free and absolutely fair. Unemployed and impoverished compatriots who lack the ability to make a living can apply. After an investigation confirms their circumstances and they provide a guarantor to prove that the borrowed funds will not be used for improper purposes, they can borrow from the newspaper's Social Service Department.</p>
<h3>Yiyou Hospital Temporary Clinic Offers Free Medical Services</h3>
<p>The Yiyou Society in Fusui Lane, Tianjin Road, is organized by enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life and spares no effort in serving the community. The society has established a temporary clinic, Yiyou Hospital, which employs physicians such as Yang and Ding Wenwei. They provide free medical services every afternoon from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM and from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM. Patients are welcome to visit for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<h3>Li Church Expands Small Loan Fund</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Li Church's Small Loan Fund Office and Material Lending Center are located in the Yinchengtang Public Hall, Xiaopi Lane, Anren Street, Nanshi. Recently, prices have risen sharply, making it difficult for small vendors with limited capital to manage their finances. The number of applicants to the association is increasing daily, and the economic directors plan to expand the small loan fund to provide widespread relief.</p>
<h3>Yijing Helps the Poor</h3>
<p>The bonsai exhibition at 165 Haig Road, opposite the De Li Church, is hosted by bonsai experts such as Kong Zhiqing. Participating in the International Flower Show has brought great reputation to the country. This winter's seasonal flowers, such as wintersweet, nandina, daffodil, and plum blossom, are particularly colorful. In view of the difficult living conditions in Shanghai and the extreme suffering of the poor, they will donate 10-20% of the flower sales to the newspaper's poverty relief fund.</p>
<h3>Aurora University Law Association Establishes Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>The Aurora University Law School Association, in order to improve its affairs and establish a scholarship fund, initiated a fundraising campaign for the association's academic fund in September of last year, raising approximately eight thousand yuan in total. The association's president, Xu Pei (Shen Tai), convened a staff meeting on the 23rd of this month and decided to allocate five thousand yuan as a scholarship fund. A scholarship fund committee was established, with Father Peng Lianshi, Dean of the Law School, as chairman, and Xu Pei, Wen Zhiyong, and nine others as committee members. The regulations have been finalized and announced. All students of the Law School can apply in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Compilation of Free Schools</h3>
<p>(1) Wude Voluntary Middle School at 750 Lane 6, Xinzha Road, has begun enrollment for this semester. Tuition and fees are completely free. Students with excellent grades and impoverished family backgrounds can apply. (2) The Shanghai YWCA has expanded its original Girls' Night School and Women's Refresher Class this year at Hongyi Middle School. Classes range from illiterate to fifth or sixth grade. Fees are very low. The Girls' Night School is purely voluntary and only charges ten yuan per semester. Both schools offer free tuition to students from impoverished families. (3) Trinity Primary School at the intersection of Ave. Haig and Gordon Road may reduce or waive fees entirely, reduce fees by three-quarters, half, or one-quarter for students from impoverished families. You can even request free books and notebooks. Applications can be made at any time before the school opens on February 3. It is better to mention the Shen Bao's introduction.</p>
