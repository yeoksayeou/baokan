<p>社評</p>
<h3>樹立新風氣</h3>
<p>世界每一戰塲的決戰形勢，一天天的逼近着，每一個交戰國家都感於處身緊張局勢裏，而竭力的想法團結，準備，和國民生活的節約刻苦。我們的國家也，參戰之列，當然也處身在緊張的局勢裏。但是，我們的團結怎樣？準備怎樣？國民生活情緒怎樣？比較別的戰時國家又怎樣？我們拉起鏡子自詳一番，並不是有意自貶的說，什麼都夠不上！僅僅以國民生活一項來作比較，已經適成相反。除了華北災區以及荒僻農村，受了天然環境的限制以外，其餘地方，尤其是都市裏，還是充滿浮糜的氣氛；除了勞苦大衆與薪水階級，受了高物價的壓制以外，其餘各界人士，尤其是有閒階級與暴發戶，還是充滿奢華的習氣，遇享樂時即享樂，可豪闊處便豪闊。</p>
<p>有人說，這話未免過火，一般中產之家，以前原可雇用一二個用人洗衣作飯的，現在則老爺小姐都提起籃子自已進菜塲；太太老太太也在燒火弄飯，可以公開談論，不以爲寒傖了。我們也承認這是一部分的事實，也可以說節的的好現象。語云：「惜衣有衣穿，惜物有物用」。意至深遠！但是我們說，這固然是好現象，然而郤好得不夠澈底，譬如穿布衣，固然安之若素，但倘使有一套嗶嘰穿在身上，也許覺得要勝一籌。又如自已買菜做飯，固然已覺平常，但假使收入變得寬裕，也許仍覺雇個用人要舒服一點，這是心理上的不澈底。此外，競尚奢華的人，依然故我，儘管酒筵已漲至數千金一席，胭脂香水己漲至數百元一枝一瓶，可是依舊戶限爲穿，銷路無殊昔日，這是習慣上的不澈底。</p>
<p>究竟是什麼道理使即的不能澈底呢？根本原因，在若干人的節約，多半緣於經濟環境的壓迫，心理上仍是傾向舒適的。換言之，即現社會的風氣，還是傾向豪華的，惟其社會風氣未變，因此，甚至有些人縱使經濟環境欠好，也不得不曲從風氣，勉　湊集數目去請一桌客，勉强去借支數十元去應酬人家的喜事壽辰。這樣風氣的展播，使有錢的人更加去濫化錢，使沒有錢的人，也跟着去蹦塲面濫化錢。際茲戰時，不僅政府，就是輿論方面想了許多方法，費了許多口舌，勸國民厲行節約，結果收效極微。譬如提倡宴客，每席不超過若干元，不超過幾碟菜，說來似易，而實行難通。此中主要關鍵，仍在風氣兩字。</p>
<p>因此，我們特鄭重提出樹立新風氣的主張來，不合時的舊風氣使它消減，爲時代所要求的新風氣，加緊把它培植起來，一經蔚然成風，不再要假藉政府法令督導或社會輿論提倡，自然羣情翕然，相率做去，風氣的力量實在太大了！我們大家要趕快的善於利用。</p>
<p>就節約說，我們希望趁此戰時，掃蕩盡奢侈浮華的舊風氣，樹立起節儉樸質的新風氣，尤須從心理上澈底的變革，不爲經濟環境而一時權變。要使大家都以布衣與舊衣爲光榮，華服盛裝爲過份；都以素食淡飯爲光榮，豐餚盛饌爲過份；都以步行操作爲健全的象徵，乘車雇僕爲老弱無用的表現；都以薄贈爲盡禮，厚餽爲失常；都以愛惜公物爲美德，濫費公物爲穢惡。不特在戰時應該如此，且將從此確立新風氣的堅固基礎，我們可以測知戰後瘡痍滿目，百廢待興，非經苦幹十年，不能建設成一現代國家。日本·德國的舉國一致過刻苦生活，節的物資，獻給國家，即如蘇聯，雖主義爲我們所不取，但其推行三次五年計劃，全國國民撙節自持，以奉國家，確是難能可貴。凡此各國的節約作風，戰時戰後，都值得我們四萬萬五千萬國民效法。我們所望樹立新風氣，不止節約一端，譬如一變文風尚，創造剛健新精神，也都爲時代的急需。特別提出樹立節儉樸質氣者，因爲是最起碼的應有變革，舉例以爲說明而已。</p>
<p>促成節約風氣的樹立和推行，我們並建議社會團體應共起領導，舉行節的實踐週，以作進一步的實踐運動，喚起各界注意。節約週中應實踐者至少包括下列數點：</p>
<p>（一）在辦公室內努力從公，以節約時間。使用一切文具用品，不絲毫糟塌，以節約物質。</p>
<p>（二）會客訪友，直截爽快將接洽事務說出，减少敷衍空話，節約時間。</p>
<p>（三）因事出門，力能步行者，安步當車。</p>
<p>（四）如有宴會必要，用最簡單之菜餚，家常便飯，務以不糟塌爲度。</p>
<p>（五）不御華服，不購高貴衣料。</p>
<p>（六）不燙髮，不用高貴化妝品。</p>
<p>（七）不購頭等戲票。</p>
<p>最要緊的，我們要舉行節約週的意義，是藉此喚起各界注意，從而永遠持續實踐，倒不是像表演一慕戲劇，戲裝在身時表演得轟轟烈烈，認認眞眞，一到戲裝卸去，表演完了，就又恢復本來面目。那又何必多此一舉呢？</p>
<p>本月十二日星期評論載張一鵬先生所著「華北賑災中的食料」一文，其中提及朱槐先生歲研究之「包豐」植物，頃據朱先生來函，更正三點：</p>
<p>（一）「包豐」原名「pou-feng」，前作「pon-feng」誤。</p>
<p>（二）炭水化物包括澱粉糖分　維三者，表中列入炭水化物，即不必列入後三項。</p>
<p>（三）此種植物眞實情形及其正確學名尚在研究考察中。</p>

<h3>日機再襲魯塞爾島　發生激烈天空戰爭　雙方戰鬥機百五十架參加　結果敵機三十三架被擊落</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日大本營本日下午三時發表：帝國海軍航空部隊於六月十二日復大舉空襲所羅門羣島之魯塞爾島，與敵機數十架交戰，擊落其中三十三架，我機五架未歸還。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十四日中央社電　據悉，美海軍部十三日發表：日航空都隊於十二日在所羅門羣島魯塞爾島上空，與美空軍展開空戰，結果美空軍喪失飛機六架。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日陸海兩軍航空部隊及陸上部隊，自去年八月第一次次所羅門海戰以來至本年六月十二日止，在南太平洋方面所擊落及擊毀之敵機數目，連此次大本營發表者在內，共達二千三百八十三架，其中被擊落者有二一〇九架，擊毀者爲二七四架。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日海軍航空部隊前於六月七日會大舉空襲魯塞爾島，擊落敵機四十九架，獲得偉大戰果。茲日大本營又於十四日發表謂，日機隊於十二日再度襲擊該島，又擊落敵機卅三架，觀此可知日美雙方現在南太平洋方面展開空中決戰已日益激烈。此次作戰經過，係日海軍機隊於十二日晨大舉飛臨魯塞爾島上空，其時敵戰鬥機隊的有七十架，正待機於該島上空，佈成迎擊日機之有利陣勢，日海軍機隊即向其中間突擊，於是雙方戰鬥機約百五十架發生激烈之混戰約歷卅分鐘。敵機所具之陣容雖優於日方，但起先即不採取積極之戰法，僅以消極之逃避戰法作戰，此點與日海軍機之烈烈攻擊精神相較，有顯著不同。日海軍機隊於此次空戰中擊落敵機達卅三架，將近其一半，日方亦損失五架。據敵方發表此次空戰中，彼僅喪失六架，此無非在隱匿其所受損害，企圖欺騙其國民及世界人士。</p>
<h3>春季作戰目的完成　湘鄂日軍頗獲戰果</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電</p>
<p>據湖南前綫某地來電，日軍此次發動之春季進攻作戰，可謂巳予渝方以致命打擊，三日作戰完成後，日軍某部隊即復歸原防。經此次進攻渝方所秘藏之精銳部隊十七師，業已喪失殆盡。故渝軍爲圖挽回頽勢及對外宣傳起見，於本月四日又在宜都西方大門土地三方面企圖反攻，但遭日軍反擊，即行潰退。計自本月四日至九日僅一週內，渝軍之新銳部隊第七十四，七十九，四十四軍各二師共六萬兵力，即被完全殲滅。蓋日軍前於五月五日在洞庭湖畔展開殲滅戰時，先擊破敵第仕九集團軍。其後在津市澧縣北方地區作戰時，又擊敗渝第十集團軍。繼即爲此次發動之反擊作戰，故殲減渝軍合共廿三師，達廿三寓人，渝軍之反攻企圖乃被完全粉碎。</p>
<p>漢口十四日中央社電</p>
<p>華中日軍近曾在湘鄂戰境擊滅渝第六戰區軍十七師後，復於本月八，九兩日在大門土地附近圍攻渝第九十四軍第二師，獲得莫大戰果。緣某方面日軍開始轉進後，渝方即已調動第四十四軍所部（軍長王澤澹）一百七十一百六十二兩師，企圖開往華容南方及安鄕南縣，四日晨開入藕池口西南之甘家廠，七日開抵大門土地及牛浪胡，（石首西南方）並企圖乘機蠢動。日軍部隊不動聲色，完成準備，即於八日分東西北三路一齊開始行動，由西北方挺進。因日軍於八日下午二時在何家潭（藕池口西方三十里）甘家廠附近猛攻，携有迫擊砲之渝方第一百六十二師約一千人，由東西北　進之日軍，亦與此相呼應，猛撲大門土地靑石碑，（藕池口西南二十五公里）並以大門土地爲中心，完成包圍戰。渝第一百六十二師及一百五十師二萬人曾圖突圍而出，但再遭日軍夜襲，終於九日拂曉被日軍完全擊潰。</p>

<p>中國靑年模範團勞動服務團自展開工作以來，除南京，廣州，武漢，南昌，已組織成立各級部隊外，其他蘇州，上海，杭州，蚌埠，安慶等地，即待編隊。茲爲明瞭各地團員生活情况，蒐集非團員之檢定資料，並以現地各機關取得緊密連繫起見，認爲有派員前往各該地視察之必要。又該團前爲適應戰時需要，於本年三月間曾派有模範團團員七人分往京滬等七地指導萞麻增產方法，以有靑少年勞動服務第一次動員之中心工作，迄今時隔三月，對於各地種植灌溉及經常動員情形上有明瞭之必要，故特指派管理處副主任張廣生幹事黃俊吾，於十五日起前往浙皖蘇滬各地視察，聞此次視察時間定一個月。聞該員等除在上述各地調查考核團員工作勤惰生活情况，及萞麻管理情形外，並於各該地模範團員各學校校長及中央宣傳講習所畢業同學座談會，以爲各檢定及成立隊部之標準。</p>

<h3>日航空部隊　轟炸摩勒斯比</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城十四日中央社電　據新金山來電，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部十三日發表戰報稱：日航空部隊十三日曾轟炸摩勒斯比及浦那港。</p>
<h3>日工兵在新幾內亞　發揮作戰精神　編成敢死隊潛入叢林　奇襲敵砲兵陣地成功</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電</p>
<p>十四日此間各報之第一版，均刋載日陸軍報道班員長井所撰之一文，記述日軍工兵廿九人奉命擊炸新幾內亞密林中敵軍砲兵陣地事，詳述該兵士等克服一切困難，潛入敵車陣地，炸毀敵軍重砲陣地，完成偉大使命之搏鬥精神，頗爲動人。茲誌其大意如次：日軍北島中隊於某月二十三日上午八時，奉命攻擊敵軍砲兵陣地，其命令有令部隊編制肉搏攻轚班，急襲基爾瓦正面之敵軍砲兵陣地，及以將校一人爲班長，編成肉搏攻擊班五組，潛入敵軍第一綫或敵軍後方，搜索敵軍砲兵陣地實施攻擊。中隊長北島中尉接奉此令後，經愼重考慮，乃在志願者之中遴選毅志堅決體力强壯者廿九人，編成肉搏攻擊班，由石田义雄見習士官任班長，一行在砲彈爆炸聲中，與隊長及戰友握別，由石田見習士官率領踴躍出發，穿越密林向目的地前進。旋於二十三日下午七時左右，行至距敵砲兵陣地四公里許之地，但因索布達至基爾瓦公路之兩側爲一濕地，樹木叢生，極其陰森，除有二三小道與基爾瓦公路相通外，則全爲人跡罕至之僻境，一行爲愼重將事，乃潛入密林，繞道至敵人背後，實行奇襲。一行皆背負炸藥，携帶手槍與手榴彈，並準備有一週間之食糧，摸索前進。密林中於白畫尚黑暗如漆，故欲夜行絕不可能，利用指南針及敵方之砲聲以爲目標，推測方向，向前挺進，二十四日忽迷失方向，乃於密林中徘徊終日，至二十五日始尋得道路，一行再潛入密林中，繼續前進，艱苦備嘗。班長石田見習士官不幸於中途戰死，且攻擊班中堅軍曹亦身負重傷，故情形稍有不利。但一行仍以不屈不撓之精神繼續前進，並公推第一組長山本兵長爲指揮，誓死前進，爲先死之班長須仇。以部隊長陣亡，繼之以隊長，隊長繼之以班長，班畏陣亡繼之以士兵，迨至最後一兵爲止之決志，繼續挺身進擊。此攻擊班自與陣亡之攻擊班長遺體與身負重傷之軍曹告別後，第一組組長山本兵長乃即於衆望所繫下，担當全體之指揮，使全體心志合一，堅固團結。一起遂於彈雨中，再繼入敵砲兵陣地，向旣定目標迫進，二十七日即進抵距敵砲兵陣地一公里之地點，但彼等絕不使敵方發覺，否則一切行動必將受阻。因此山本兵長始終領導全體秘密前進，抱定「不入虎穴焉得虎子」之堅志，終於潛入敵軍陣地背後。乃遣士兵三名，竄入草叢，詳爲偵察敵方陣地情况，得悉敵之砲兵陣地乃構築於高及丈餘之草叢中，砲身悉爲草叢遮蔽。見其砲兵陣地共有六處，其後方與台地之間則建有大天慕兩個，又於台地之對面，設有形似本部之一大幕帳，且該處並遺有餐餘之食器與飯盒等物，但並未見敵兵隻影。日軍勇士當即將敵陣地之配備情况詳爲記下，三氏於偵察完畢，即返回原處。山本兵長遂與全員詳覽其圖，同時指示轟炸目標，於是即分別指定各組轟炸敵砲六門，各組受命後，即突出叢林進抵草原後，進至距敵砲陣約五百米之近處，在霄光一閃間，敵砲聲雷鳴，彈如狂風暴雨射出，但彼等乃由後脊之草地中匍匐前進，衝入敵陣，移時敵陣砲聲漸弱，彼等乃潛入敵方幕營中，此爲認爲襲擊之機會已到，彼等旋潛踪至敵前二十米處停止，各組準備已畢，靜待山本兵長號令。有頃彈聲已息，明日復現，山本兵長旋即發出突擊號令，全員乃身踏叢草，如飛突入，但惜彼等之行動，巳早爲敵所知悉，警戒陣地之敵兵即自右側之草叢與左側陣地之後方，以自動步槍亂射，但受山本兵長命令，已繞過敵方警戒之指揮班即出而應戰，第一組亦即投擲炸藥，突破敵方最右翼砲兵陣地，繞至敵方帳幕附近，見帳幕中燃有燈火，並有三四十名澳洲兵羣集該處。於是山本兵長乃下令轟炸目前之二門敵砲，轟然一響，二門重砲瞬即粉碎，同時復以炸彈向幕舍投擲，有三四十名澳兵當予擊斃後，續將側面之敵砲二門炸毀。敵兵爲些三聲巨響所驚，乃紛自附近幕舍中奔出，以自動步槍及手榴彈應戰，雙方旋即展開混戰後，繼聞鏗鏗數聲巨響，自敵砲兵陣地發出，此爲又有敵砲數門之被毀。是時第三組亦向指定之敵砲兵陣地進攻，敵以自動步槍猛射，但彼等始終匍匐前進，旋於敵陣地近處，乃至砲口下急擲炸藥，炸毀敵砲六門，於是連日施展猛威之敵砲遂即沉默。按彼等於行途中雖失去指揮官，仍不屈不撓，欣然於一員兵長指揮下，團結一致，以大無畏之英勇精神，終於完成其偉大之任務，日軍工兵魂之精神，實已顯揚矣。</p>

<h3>英國企圖進犯西西里　直布羅陀活動頻繁　德在沿海築堅强防禦工事　地中海敵艦遭德機猛襲</h3>
<p>拉里尼亞十四日中央社電　海通社訊：最近數日中直布羅陀大見活動。據可恃方面消息，昨有英國技術工人四五〇名到達該處，開工數月之地底建築工程，將加緊進行，沿海砲臺亦已築成，並有特殊保護設放機關爲一電紐。此外又有英登陸小艇四十三艘及大型拖船五艘，已於昨日駛抵直布羅陀，謠傳此項船隻係派往北非準備供侵犯西西里之用。目前停泊直港之商輪，祇有二十六艘，內有三艘在在修理中。</p>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　德國新聞社空軍訪員，弗萊太格少校宣稱：星期六德重轟炸機加緊空襲西西里海峽及班泰勒里亞附近之海面，向班島之港務設備與停泊附近之船隻投彈轟炸，而尤集中於少數大型艦船與特殊登陸平底船，被直接命中而受創者爲數不少，內有大型裝甲登陸用船一艘，中彈後立即下沈。德機第二次空襲中，英美運輸艦隊中，至少又有登陸用船十二艘中彈沈沒。入晚僅重轟炸羣又在拉姆培杜薩附近襲擊英船一隊，英高射砲隊雖猛烈抵抗，但仍中彈命中軍艦六艘，其一中彈後，曾發生猛力爆炸。德機員爲求投彈準確計，均飛行甚低，尤其成功者，當爲德國轟炸機羣之夜襲比塞大港，因英美在該處除泊有大型艦船多艘外，更集中大批登陸用艦，此次遭德機擊沈者至少有二十艘之多，德機未返防者祇有一架。</p>
<p>歐洲堡壘固若金湯　英報承認侵犯不易</p>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　海通社訊：英國「經濟週刋」載稱，歐洲之堡壘固若金湯，必須作重大之犧牲，始能予以擊破，歐洲目前雖偶然發見破壞之行動，但大多數人民仍安心工作，盡其職員。歐洲各地之德方官吏，大半皆來往各地與進行工作，毫無困擾，外國人力之動員，無欵爲德方之成　，今德國已獲得其所需要之工人矣。况德國之反布爾希維克軍事行動亦並未失敗，反軸心空襲之效果或易陷於過份誇張。英美之主要目的，係在魯爾區域，但該區之工業所代表者，尙不及德國全部工業能力之五分之一，該區所產煤綱亦僅佔德方全部產業三分之一，德國防工業均在更東之區，包括薩爾斯格特之新鋼鐵廠·法勒斯里本之最大坦克車廠·留那之化學工廠·蘇台特之人造橡皮工業·上西里亞與波蘭南部之新工廠等，故集中轟炸，難獲預期之效果。德國之戰鬥力與士氣均未崩潰，大西洋與地中海沿岸均已建築堅强防禦工事並裝有重砲云。</p>

<h3>義政治家評論　議大利參戰前途　經歷艱苦早在意料之中　爭取最後勝昨具有決心</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩十四日中史社電　斯蒂芬尼社訊著名政治問題專家艾森，在報上爲文評論義大利之參戰，謂義大利在此次戰爭中，甚　維持中立。西方國家之攻擊德國，最自然之途徑乃經由義大利，故義國唯有參加戰鬥，否則將坐以待敗。義相墨索里尼顯然並不期望在短期間內容易獲得勝昨，當義大利宣戰之時，義相即知財閥國家勢必反對義大利所期望獲致符合義民族之偉大及重望墍義國之安全之地位。多年來義相並未幻想義大利之　途係賡　大道，義大利之向財閥國家宣戰，已證實無論從何種見解觀之，義大利之命運，必須由戰爭決定。即使議大利維持中立，若西方之國家獲勝利，義大利必將喪失其大國之地位，而不能在可忍之狀况中存在。義國在此項或仍爲大國或淪爲附庸之兩途中，乃選擇任何其他大國在同樣環境下所僅能選擇之唯一途徑。義大利在參戰三週年念中，適臨該國在近代歷史中之最嚴重時期，實並非出乎義相及義政府意　之外，蓋此次戰爭之艱苦，實早在意料實之中，但義大利之狀况，並不若許多人所想偈之危急。義國之精神上資源，已作空前之動員，義國之抗戰意志力量，或仍將使舉世震驚，將來如何，實不必懸揣。反軸心或將先後向撒了及西西里兩島攻繫，但若企圖進攻義大利本土，則目前實不可能。於此義大利之敵人將遭巨大之困難，且有遭遇慘敗之虞，戰爭之轉捩　或即在此。義大利在現局之下，並不徘徊於退却或決意獲勝之間，義人已決定爭取勝利。義相所言「吾人必將回去」一語，實係發自義人之心坎，彼輩以爲義大利並未準備經歷困難者，須知大多數戰爭之決定，不由於偶然之物質優越，而實由於精神上之因素。在此次　爭中，精神之因素係在義大利方面云。</p>

<p>阿根廷京城十四日中央社電　據洛杉感磯來電：此間十日曾發生短衣流氓團與美兵衝突事件，其後復擴大至加利福尼亞洲南部諸都市，當局已開始積極調查。至十二日白畫洛杉磯市又發生大規模之羣毆事件，即該短衣流氓團與婦人補助隊員合流，以美陸海軍士兵及海軍陸戰員爲對手。演成大混鬥，結果負傷者頗多。州當局以加利福尼亞州各地連續發生暴動事件，州長亦束手無策，故乃出面爲雙方調停。然於過去一週間，因暴動事件受輕重傷亡者已達百二十五人，事實上已成爲社會上之重大問題。</p>
<h3>日本海戰與日特蘭海戰（二）</h3>
<p>— 伊藤正德</p>
<p>（四）水雷夜戰的優越性</p>
<p>當五月二十七日主力砲　戰時，擊沉敵方主力艦情銳八　成的東鄕元帥，尙不以此絕大勝利爲滿足。而尙認爲非殲滅受傷且企圖逃同海參威的第一流戰　艦一艘，第二綫戰艦三艘，重巡洋艦三艘，輕巡艦六艘，海防艦三艘，　逐艦九艘等不可。東鄕長官早就車擬好了這各計劃。這就是所謂七合戰計劃，第一合戰爲主力砲戰，第二合戰爲水雷夜戰，第三合戰爲翌日之主力砲戰，第四合戰爲主力砲夜戰，是按此種順序而繼續進行攻擊，擬在第四天頭上悉數擊沉敵人。其第二合戰是從二十七日下午七時三十分開始的。第一驅逐艦，第二驅逐艦，第九水雷艇第三隊由北方，而第三。第四。第五等三驅逐隊由東方，而第一。第十。第十五。第十七。第二十等水雷艇隊由南方，三面包圍敵軍殘餘艦隊　而實行衝律肉搏。敵人以尼古拉一世號戰艦爲領隊，把十艘車艦分成兩排，向北急駛中，遭受到我方三面水雷戰隊的激烈　擊，戰艦諾瓦材號被擊沉，戰艦西梭，維營基號沉沒，重巡洋艦那希夢長號及輕巡洋艦受諾麻　長號大破（翌日朝皆沉沒），其損失之大根如此。</p>
<p>主力艦隊因暮色所妨碍。退出戰塲時是七時二十分，但水雷戰在七時三十分則業已　開始了。敵人碰到我們這樣的　周到計劃與迅雷般的追擊，而未曾得到片刻的喘息，夜色漸暗，以爲可以少微安心休息一下，但這種甜夢只不過是短短十分鐘，眞夠可燐了。然而此次水雷戰　在一丈多國的波浪奔騰的汪洋大海中，竟不顧一切地開始進行，我們一百噸級的水雷艇，曾在六十度中顚　動搖着。在這樣動蕩中，羅盤針簡直無用武之地，艇上的將士全身被浸於水中，望遠鏡完全　者一層水氣而模糊不清，航行簡直近於不可能的狀態，但四十艘小艦艇具有與敵方大艦共　死亡的決心而急劇迫近，經過四小時的反復攻擊，而終收獲到前述的大戰果。</p>
<p>本來，水雷夜戰是日本海軍特長之一，但所謂特長的原因，是具有與敵共死亡的　勇敢決心。日本與日特關海戰　的　英國的水雷戰隊，在技術上雖然有差別，但其英勇善鬥精神，則有無可比擬的不同性。</p>
<p>（五）夜戰之自信與恐怖</p>
<p>將士的的差別當然也有，但主要的，司令長官也有根本　之不同點。哲利科在下午九時（光度與日本海七時三十分相同）命其驅逐艦隊排列於主力艦　隊的五英里後方，以備德水雷戰隊從後方謝謝射水雷。而英國的水雷戰隊警繫德國主力艦艦隊的事情，是由於偶然接觸而一生，並晨根據哲利科的意旨而行者。東　元帥在五月二十日海戰當中，從未想到愛毛反用水雷戰隊保衛自　，如終是命令水雷戰隊拚命向　敵人放射水雷。</p>
<p>最主要者，「夜戰」在元帥的觀點看來，是殲滅戰中一個必發手段，元帥是有非常的期待與自信而採用者。哲利科止與此相反，他認爲夜戰是對勁　敵的戰鬥方法，　　託辭來規避這一戰鬥方法。他的話中有一句「Very　Largely　matter　of　chance」，曾在海戰記述中已　經介紹過。結果把「Chance」失掉，還有什麼戰爭可言呢？此外，在他的話中還可以看到非常像婦人孺子之類的辯解。我們從其著作「偉大艦隊（Grand　fleet）」一書中，譯出一節來以資證明。</p>
<p>「德國海軍的組織　對於夜戰是出類拔萃的。他們的鑑別信呈特別　出。我們幾乎等於零。他們的探照燈比我們强。最後一個論據是他們的夜間　砲襲極其熟嫻（指其描準　與發射速度而言）。我認爲關於夜戰　必須學習德國海軍」。</p>
<p>這樣說來，德英兩國的海戰簡直是師生之爭，所以萬分之一的勝利希望也沒有，這就是哲利科不進行夜戰的原因，他認爲敵人如此能幹善戰，即在盡戰也對敵人有所畏懼。不輕敵，這得算英國海軍的優點。</p>
<p>爲什麼東鄕元帥　和哲利科有這樣大的優劣之分呢！日本海　時兩軍的第一流　艦，日本四部，而俄國五艘，且俄團五艘中的四艦如斯奧羅夫號，亞力山大三世號，包羅廷號，阿里耀號都比我國的三笠號性能强，當時俄國的四艘爲世界最優秀者），證一點外國的評論家早已指出，但東鄕元帥一次　也沒有提過這一點，只在想必須全部　擊潰這批軍艦。號全部　潰敵人的　將帥與　　敵人全部逃脫的將帥間　其性格當然有天壞之別。</p>
<p>（六）德國提督也已道破</p>
<p>躱避主力夜戰，這即使是一件平　事，但擁有七十餘　　逐艦的給予對優勢，而不然實行夜襲，這是令人萬分不可解的謎。德國艦隊長官　喜亞提督在下午九時後，而暗暗自己忖度，必須以主力艦突破重國，向根據地直駛，但他也曾擔心　夜間作戰的事。喜亞在其目特蘭海　戰日記上說：</p>
<p>「敵人如果在黃分　用共强大的主力向我軍攻擊，入夜後，如果接　再用驅逐艦　寶行水雷夜發，那末就會壓迫我方艦隧更駛向西方，材準　强制我方翌日作畫戰。他根明顯地有這種實行力量。」</p>
<p>有這種實行力量　而未實行者是哲利科。喜亞海軍上將雖然小心翼翼地警戒那種實行力量，但英軍出乎意外地並未夜　，且規　夜戰，所以喜亞艦隊得到如此的意外收　，而竟太平無事地同到自己根振地去了。</p>
<p>但哲利科的夜戰規避，即是自動來得天獨厚的　勝利機會。這一點，在任何人的眼睛當中，都如日月之明。但英國海軍公報上反說「The　Commander-in-Chief　decided　very　rightly　ont　to　fight　nignt　action　艦隊司令長官決定不進行夜戰，可謂非常得當。」實際上，司令長官是迴避夜戰，只有這種判語　爲洽當，但迴避夜戰竟得到了稱贊，認爲正確。如不稱贊而叙述一下也就完了，可是頌揚爲很得當，如此英國的海軍部也不能不分擔一點戰略錯誤的責任。總之，他們　成戰略思想的　基礎者是安全第一，這在演習時是可以說得過去的，可是在實際作戰時就不能抱這種思想了。假如東鄕元帥是哲利的話，則會正相反。</p>
<p>日本海戰時　站在甲板上　說敵人的元帥雄姿，是日本全體團民起碼必須　要看一次的戰爭槍圖。而靠在　昂公爵號　十三英寸司令塔內鎭靜無事的　哲利科之繪圖，在英國任何地方都看不到，眞是「良有以也」。（濤：譯自六月號中公論）</p>

<h3>贊助修葺黃大癡墓</h3>

<h3>記現代日本畫展</h3>
<p>— 劉漢儒</p>
<p>日本國際　文化振興會主辦之「現代日本繪畫展覽會」業於昨日（十四日）在大新畫廳揭幕，舉行預展，東邀本市各界參　。今日起至廿日止公開展覧，不收門券。</p>
<p>月前，日本帝國美術同人曾，曾舉行日本畫展覽於本市愛多亞路浦東同鄕會大樓，巴列品中固不乏佳作，但出品不及此次現代日本繪畫展生色，且帝國美術同人會畫展作品，係標價出寶者，現代日本畫展目的在促　中日藝術突流，境進中日國民情感，其巴列品絕對不售出，故兩畫　舉行意義截然不同。</p>
<p>在新畫廳巴列作品，全部約七十點左右，都爲日本第一流名家佳作，琳瑯滿目，美小勝收，以個人愛好，覺出品中最精萃者，有左述各幅：</p>
<p>（一）第二十四號小潤，堂本印象作，以水墨淡彩，　　秋景·楓葉·竹·　子·　廟·佈局趙逸·筆資括撥·秋風籍薰·如聞其聲。</p>
<p>（二）第三號山村秋晴，川合玉堂作。與前幅同爲寫秋景之佈，但用筆取材各有特長，佈局別饒清壽，有西洋畫色彩，寫竹甚雅淡，盡樹　　古，竹樹配合，　，幅秋景，閱之　領醇醪，此幅讀之，則似兵常唐　。</p>
<p>（三）第五號山珍海味，小寶舉雲作，作者爲日本南畫復興盟主，本幅係寫實作，車　寫魚·曁·芋艿等實物，設色　艷，　詞：「欄前相海魚暇富，　後田間菜蔬新」甚雅緻。</p>
<p>（四）第卅九號征馬，吉時忠夫作，完全日本盡筆，寫一千五百年前，日本武士出征變夷時情狀，馬肥人壯，　風　　，武士道精神表現無遺，　色什妙，九　餘事。</p>
<p>（五）第卅號水禽，鄕倉千靱作，作者爲近　派畫家之一，水禽雨羽，墨筆談寫，一半　尋食沒入水中，一騰躍水面，　態秀媽，古　盎然。</p>
<p>（六）第二號黎明，淸山大觀作，作者爲日本美術院之元老，曾　文化勳章，黎明一幅，寫富士山朔最初　，皚皚白雪，反映天空，山下淸烟漢漫，觀托山頂，極爲雄壯，將日本精　　東亞精神寄托於富十靈峯，象微東亞光明，造意用　，並　佳妙，其雄渾之筆姜，允令人警往，雲　係以中國松烟墨所繪，故國董機可愛，聞作者珍藏中國巴墨　夥，其作品能因之別具傳點。</p>
<p>列入特品中有數幅，　爲一訊：</p>
<p>（一）　　，權本關雪作，橋本氏之名，　中國並不生疏，（本報自由談間譯載共作品「上海雜記」）彼嘗競席游歷中華，與　國藝術名注往　甚發，墨猴爲其成名之代表作，　武墨筆，寫黑　二跳躍於古老松幹之上，襯以雪景，脫盡烟火氣，聞橋本氏之名，以黑猴作成問世而大彰，得列入日本第一流名家，實具功力，非倖致也。</p>
<p>（二）家免與猴，竹內西風作，寫三猴於架上，各有姿態，一嬉戲，一疑視，另一則改悵望，情詞活豐於畫面，範內免九頭，哈　可愛，的是侍品。</p>
<p>（三）　熟，西　五當作，寫新麥一捆登塲，兩犢嗅麥側，稿十餘省軍棵敵置犢足下，觀以花枝數幹，　置極警，作者日本畫界元老之一。</p>
<p>綜觀全部出品，均能稱上　之作，上述各點，爲個人所特別愛好者隨意錄出，藉諸仰景之意。</p>
<p>本市名畫家　瘦鐵，鄭午昌，孫雪泥等昨日均蒞塲參觀，錢氏對橋本關雪之作品，尤多贊美之調。</p>

<h3>埠際足球滬預賽　決定今日在虹口公園舉行</h3>
<p>（中央社滬訊）上海大連兩市對抗運動委員會，爲提倡體育增加中日德意四國關係起見，特主辦上海大連埠際對抗運動大會，定於本月廿日午後十二時半，在虹口公園舉行，本定期於本月十二日下午五時在膠州公園舉行足球預選，因一再天雨延期，茲悉該會已經決定於今（十五）日下午五時在膠州公園舉行，預賽分紅白兩隊角逐，挑選優秀球員，於大會時與來自大連三球將對壘，天雨決不延期。</p>
<h3>體育世界社編印　三集體育年鑑</h3>
<p>上海體育世界社二年來出版之上海體育年鑑，頗爲全國體育界所歡迎，現開始編印民國三十二年度第三集，定七月十五日出版，爲求搜集完備起見，歡迎各體育會球隊供給材料，凡最近一年來之體育活動，比賽成績，體育會組織歷史，皆所歡迎，寄辣斐德路慈安里A五號體育世界社，或申報體育新聞部轉，本月二十五日截止。</p>
<p>小言論</p>
<h3>崇儉運動</h3>
<p>傳曰：「國奢則示之以儉」，可知崇儉爲平時奢侈的反動。目前萬方多難，四海困窮，物信高漲，民不聊生，於是「節約消費」乃成爲　府戰時經濟政策五大綱領之一，可知崇儉又爲戰時窮困的適應。戰爭對大衆雖爲痛苦，然對少數處在安全地帶大發其投機的積的國難財者或反爲千載一時的難得機會，故崇儉亦爲針對戰時發國難財者所度紙醉金聲學家生活的反動。</p>
<p>吾人濟覽史乘，知崇依依不舍爲正統思想，勸奢爲異端觀念，因爲曾文正公曾經說過：「由儉入奢易，由奢反儉難」。從前孫傳芳做五省聯軍總司令頒有「崇儉公約」，而二十五年國府行政院又有「公務人員革除浪費禮俗暫行現程」之公佈。最近本報本「天下與亡，匹夫有責」之義，乃有「節省宴會公約」之倡議，期拘海上奢移頹風於萬一，亦不過是修久的崇儉史實中之一端。</p>
<p>往昔遜淸咸同間中興名臣之一胡林翼氏曾謂：「必嚴禁官塲應酬陋習，與羣吏史臺，崇尙敦樸，屏除浮華」，故其政僅次於間文正公。設能天假之年，其功勳或能駕文正公而上之，亦未可知。</p>
<p>平時崇儉須始自政界，俾樹之風聲，目前時異勢遷，公務員生少可憐，政界酒肉徵逐之風已歸平息息。故戰時崇儉須始自商界，蓋發國難財者多屬商界之囤貨份子，而平日揮金如土者，亦即此輩。我國往昔之階級順序爲「士農工商」，今則已易爲「商工農士」，故崇儉運動的對象，乃爲商界，而挽救社會上頹風與經濟界危機的麗任，亦在商界。</p>
<h3>積極整飭金融機構　銀行公會實行自肅</h3>
<p>財部爲强化金融機構，已有整理各小銀行之決定，凡資本總數在三百萬元以下之銀行，不許營業，實施辦法，不久公佈，因此最近各銀行均有爭先增資之傾向，或有合併之議，蓋非如此不能使銀行繼續存在也。</p>
<p>聯合營業甚爲可能</p>
<p>據國風社該員以此徵諸中國方面銀行界人士，銀行合併問題，自爲最必要之措置，但由各銀行個別之特雖性視之，則合併或有困難，故各銀行隨時編成放款銀團，作聯合營業之舉，較之合併，似更可能。惟目下銀行公會已爲確立銀行及農工商業之正常關係，而作自肅之運動，並希望財政部及實業部能及時作適切之監督，凡營業內容不法之銀行，不問其資本多少，均應予以斷然處置。</p>
<p>五六兩月新設銀行</p>
<p>近最近新設銀行行，大多數之資本均在三百元以上，如四五兩月內新設銀行十二家中，資本達三百萬者計八家，三百萬元以下者僅四家，各行名稱及資本，調查如下：南京興業三〇〇，（單位萬元）統業三〇〇，永和二五〇，東華三〇〇，中國瓷業三〇〇，實康三〇〇，通華三〇〇，益泰三〇〇，錦德二〇〇，富中二五〇，中國酒業二〇〇，中國勤業三〇〇，</p>
<p>銀行增資情形一般</p>
<p>又最近兩月來增資之銀行，新資在三百萬元以下者僅一家，計開浦東銀行一〇〇（舊資單位萬元）—五〇〇（新資）長城六〇—三〇〇，大來五〇—一〇〇上海工商二〇〇—五〇〇，上海寔業一〇〇—五〇〇亞洲一〇〇—五〇〇，永明二〇〇—五〇〇，神州寔業一五〇—五〇〇，泰和興六〇—五〇〇，江浙企業一五〇—五〇〇，中國產業四〇〇—六〇〇，大康一〇〇—五〇〇，大南二〇〇—五〇〇，大新二〇〇—五〇〇，瑞華二〇〇—五〇〇。</p>
<h3>中儲行等　調劑六底金融</h3>
<p>中儲銀行曁銀錢業準備會庫，鑒於六底結賬期將屆，爲調劑同業金融安定市面起見，竭力辦理同業拆放貼現以資週轉。（一）中儲滬行同業短期拆放，其提供抵押品以租界區域內不動產，銀聯會公單公庫證，無投機性及非必需之各種貨物，及有價證券爲限，期限最多不得超過三天。（二）銀錢業準備會庫摩加迪沙拆放，凡會員行莊得提供財產爲擔保申請拆放，經評價估値視需要情形，酌予拆放，期間定爲十日。（三）各行莊所繳存款準備金，得由公會保證向中儲申請貼現，暫以各行莊七在期本標貼現爲原則。頃各行莊經中儲等調劑頭寸後，本身基礎愈風充實，一切應付實價如，對於各業正當需要之貸放，在極端審愼之下通融辦理。（一）各業收買農產品放款，如小麥新茶菜子豆類等儘貸放，惟以各該本業爲限，（二）工商各業因增加生產需要款項，經審查合格者酌予貸放。（三）六底到期之款，不請信用與抵押，如有正當理由不違背法令者，得予酌量通融展期。所以滬市整個金融經後直接之調劑後始終穏定，工商各業決能安渡此六底比期云。</p>
<h3>中交兩行　辦理小麥貸款</h3>
<p>本年各地主要產區小麥新貸，即將於本月二十日左右登塲，因本年天時雨水調勻，麥季收穫豐稔。商統會粉麥專業委員會爲加强收買小麥工作，業已在上海南京蕪湖等九區設立分支辦事處，限於今（十五）日一律組織完成，關於收買小麥資金，幷經與中儲銀行訂立協約，指定由中國交通兩行於六七兩月份中貸款十萬萬元，以爲收買小麥資金之需要。聞此種小麥貸款，決以商業承兌匯標方式行之，賣戶可以開發之商業票據向中儲銀行重貼現云。</p>
<h3>劃頭制度不廢</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行自六月一日起接收票據交換所，辦理交換淸算後，對於同業存款劃頭與現鈔同樣辦理，故劃頭前途將歸消滅。唯銀聯會方面認爲這遇强度銀根緊縮時，劃頭仍有必要，故要求該制度繼續存在，聞最今年洽商結果，決定劃頭在原則上仍予存在，然須在財政部管理下加以運用云。</p>
<h3>中央儲蓄會發行　特儲獎劵辦法</h3>
<p>中央儲蓄會，爲鼓勵人民　儲蓄起見，特照會章之規定，發行之特別儲畜獎券，券面已在印中，約　七月初開始發行，九月底即可在滬當衆開獎，第一期獎券，將由本市天運公司獨家經理，轉派各分銷處銷售。</p>
<h3>糧商註冊費　業已規定</h3>
<p>上海區雜糧業公會，連日代糧食部辦理糧商註冊事宜，其規定期賣商資本在二十萬元以上者，爲甲等。未糧販費商註冊費一千元。資本千萬元以上者爲乙等，註冊費六百元。資本五萬元以上者爲丙等，註冊費四百元。配給商資本十萬元以上者爲甲等，米糧配給商註冊費六百元。資本五萬元以上者爲乙等，註冊費四百元，資本在二萬元以上爲丙等，註冊費二百元。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股市面仍在狹小範團中徘徊，成交不旺，價則升多降少，新藥業中法稍升，新亞站關口，五洲略低，信誼與上週末同，明星得水略高。百貨業仍平疲；永安亦站前價，新新略疲，國貨反升，中國內衣削低尙微，景福衫襪略升。永安紡織堅　逾恒，美亞微升，冷落已久之鼎新染織，忽爲買戶垂靑，價驟抬上，新　印染美綸毛絨均不乏成交。文化業商務略回，中華疲　能興。世界仍爲前價。公用業升降均微；閘北水電略低，華商電氣徵昂。南洋烟公司仍在下降中，大中華火柴平定，聯華及新益兩地產股交稀價平，實業股元安與通易求供相捋，德豐針織高價迭見，中興木業少售戶，金融業股尤爲堅　，華豐搪瓷優先成交不稀，信和已有權利做開。</p>
<h3>各業公會動態</h3>
<p>玻璃業　玻璃業同業聯合會奉令籌備就緒，於昨（十四）日下午二時在八仙橋靑年會開成立會，到蘇浙皖三省京滬兩特別市四業公會代表三十餘人，討論會章後，推選周文美徐肇和等廿一人爲理事，沈家錫周百齡等九人爲監事，當塲各理監事宜誓就職後，　接開第一次理監事聯席會議云</p>

<h3>Establishing a New Social Ethos</h3>
<p>The decisive situation on every battlefield around the world is approaching day by day, and every belligerent nation feels the tension and is striving to unite, prepare, and economize in national life. Our nation is also in the ranks of the belligerents and is naturally in a tense situation. But what about our unity? What about our preparations? What about the mood of our national life? How do we compare to other wartime countries? If we hold up a mirror and examine ourselves, not intending to demean ourselves, we can't measure up in any way! Just taking national life as a comparison, we are already the opposite. Apart from the disaster areas of North China and the remote rural areas, which are restricted by the natural environment, other places, especially the cities, are still filled with a frivolous atmosphere; apart from the working masses and the salaried class, who are suppressed by high prices, other people, especially the idle class and the nouveau riche, are still full of extravagant habits, enjoying themselves when they can and being lavish where they can.</p>
<p>Some say that this is an exaggeration. Ordinary middle-class families used to be able to hire one or two servants to do laundry and cook, but now the masters and young ladies are carrying baskets and going to the vegetable market themselves; the wives and old ladies are also cooking, and they can talk about it openly without being ashamed. We also admit that this is a part of the reality, and it can be said to be a good sign of thrift. As the saying goes, "If you cherish your clothes, you will have clothes to wear; if you cherish your things, you will have things to use." The meaning is profound! But we say that this is certainly a good phenomenon, but it is not thorough enough. For example, wearing cloth clothes is certainly something one can be content with, but if one has a suit of serge to wear, one might feel that it is a cut above. Also, buying vegetables and cooking oneself is certainly considered normal, but if one's income becomes more abundant, one might still feel that hiring a servant is more comfortable. This is a lack of thoroughness in mentality. In addition, those who compete in extravagance are still the same as before. Even though banquets have risen to thousands of gold per table, and rouge and perfume have risen to hundreds of yuan per stick or bottle, they are still crowded, and sales are no different from the past. This is a lack of thoroughness in habits.</p>
<p>What is the reason why thrift cannot be thorough? The fundamental reason is that the thrift of some people is mostly due to the pressure of the economic environment, and their mentality is still inclined to comfort. In other words, the social ethos is still inclined to luxury. Because the social ethos has not changed, even some people with poor economic circumstances have to conform to the ethos and try to scrape together money to invite a table of guests, or reluctantly borrow dozens of yuan to attend other people's weddings and birthdays. The spread of this ethos makes the rich spend money even more recklessly, and makes the poor follow suit and spend money recklessly to save face. In these wartime circumstances, not only the government, but also public opinion, has tried many methods and wasted a lot of words to persuade the people to practice thrift, but the results have been minimal. For example, advocating that banquets should not exceed a certain amount per table, or a certain number of dishes, seems easy to say, but it is difficult to implement. The main key to this is still the ethos.</p>
<p>Therefore, we specifically put forward the proposition of establishing a new social ethos. We should reduce the old ethos that is not in line with the times, and step up the cultivation of the new ethos that is required by the times. Once it becomes a common practice, there is no need to resort to government laws and regulations to supervise or social opinion to promote it. Naturally, everyone will agree and follow suit. The power of the ethos is really too great! We must all quickly learn to use it well.</p>
<p>In terms of thrift, we hope to take advantage of this wartime period to sweep away the old ethos of extravagance and frivolity, and establish a new ethos of thrift and simplicity. In particular, we must undergo a thorough change in mentality, and not temporarily change due to the economic environment. We must make everyone regard cloth clothes and old clothes as glorious, and fancy clothes and grand attire as excessive; regard vegetarian meals and light meals as glorious, and sumptuous dishes and delicacies as excessive; regard walking and manual labor as a symbol of health, and riding in a car and hiring servants as a sign of old age and uselessness; regard light gifts as fulfilling one's obligations, and heavy gifts as abnormal; regard cherishing public property as a virtue, and wasting public property as disgusting. This should not only be the case in wartime, but also lay a solid foundation for establishing a new ethos from now on. We can foresee that after the war, the country will be scarred and everything will need to be rebuilt. It will take ten years of hard work to build a modern nation. The Japanese and Germans are united in living a hard life, saving materials, and dedicating them to the country. Even the Soviet Union, although we do not approve of its ideology, its promotion of three five-year plans, with the people of the whole country economizing and supporting the country, is indeed commendable. The thrifty style of these countries, both during and after the war, is worthy of emulation by our 450 million people. What we hope to establish in a new social ethos is not just thrift. For example, changing the style of writing and creating a vigorous new spirit are also urgent needs of the times. The special emphasis on establishing a thrifty and simple atmosphere is because it is the most basic and necessary change, and is given as an example for illustration.</p>
<p>To promote the establishment and implementation of a thrifty ethos, we also suggest that social organizations should jointly take the lead in holding thrift practice weeks, in order to carry out further practical activities and arouse the attention of all sectors. The practices that should be included in the thrift week include at least the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Strive to work diligently in the office to save time. Use all stationery and supplies without wasting them in the slightest to save materials.</p>
<p>(2) When meeting guests and visiting friends, state the matters for negotiation directly and quickly, reducing perfunctory and empty talk, and saving time.</p>
<p>(3) When going out on business, walk if you can.</p>
<p>(4) If a banquet is necessary, use the simplest dishes and home-cooked meals, and be sure not to waste them.</p>
<p>(5) Do not wear fancy clothes, and do not buy expensive clothing materials.</p>
<p>(6) Do not perm your hair, and do not use expensive cosmetics.</p>
<p>(7) Do not buy first-class tickets.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that the meaning of holding a thrift week is to take this opportunity to arouse the attention of all sectors, and then continue to practice it forever. It is not like performing a drama. When wearing the costume, the performance is earth-shattering and serious. Once the costume is taken off and the performance is over, it returns to its original appearance. Then why bother to do it?</p>
<p>An article entitled "Food in North China Relief" by Mr. Zhang Yipeng, published in the "Weekly Review" on the 12th of this month, mentioned the "Baofeng" plant studied by Mr. Zhu Huai. According to Mr. Zhu's letter, there are three corrections:</p>
<p>(1) "Baofeng" was originally named "pou-feng", formerly "pon-feng" in error.</p>
<p>(2) Carbohydrates include starch, sugar, and fiber. If carbohydrates are listed in the table, there is no need to list the last three items.</p>
<p>(3) The true situation of this plant and its correct scientific name are still under study and investigation.</p>

<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Russell Island Again Fierce Air Battles Ensue 150 Fighters Participate Result: 33 Enemy Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM today: On June 12th, the Imperial Navy's air force launched another large-scale air raid on Russell Island in the Solomon Islands and engaged dozens of enemy aircraft, shooting down 33 of them. Five of our aircraft have not returned.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - It is reported that the U.S. Navy Department announced on the 13th: On June 12th, the Japanese air force engaged in an air battle with the U.S. Air Force over Russell Island in the Solomon Islands. As a result, the U.S. Air Force lost six aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - From the first Solomon Sea battle in August of last year to June 12th of this year, the number of enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed by the Japanese Army and Navy air forces and ground forces in the South Pacific, including those announced by the General Headquarters this time, totals 2,383, of which 2,109 were shot down and 274 were destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Navy air force launched a large-scale air raid on Russell Island on June 7th, shooting down 49 enemy aircraft and achieving great results. Now, the Japanese General Headquarters announced again on the 14th that the Japanese air force attacked the island again on the 12th, shooting down another 33 enemy aircraft. It can be seen that the aerial decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the South Pacific is becoming increasingly fierce. According to reports, the Japanese Navy air force flew over Russell Island on the morning of the 12th. At that time, 70 enemy fighters were waiting in the air over the island, forming a favorable formation to intercept the Japanese air force. The Japanese Navy air force immediately launched an attack in the middle, and about 150 fighters from both sides engaged in a fierce dogfight for about 30 minutes. Although the enemy's formation was superior to the Japanese side, they did not adopt an active fighting method from the beginning, but only fought with a passive escape method. This is significantly different from the fierce attacking spirit of the Japanese Navy air force. The Japanese Navy air force shot down 33 enemy aircraft in this air battle, which is almost half of their total. The Japanese side also lost five aircraft. According to the enemy's announcement, they only lost six aircraft in this air battle. This is nothing more than concealing the damage they suffered in an attempt to deceive their own people and the people of the world.</p>
<h3>Spring Campaign Objectives Achieved Japanese Forces in Hunan and Hubei Score Gains</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from a certain front in Hunan, the spring offensive launched by the Japanese army this time can be said to have dealt a fatal blow to the Chongqing side. After the three-day battle was completed, a certain Japanese army unit returned to its original defense. After this offensive, the 17th Division, the elite unit secretly hidden by the Chongqing side, has been completely lost. Therefore, in order to restore the declining situation and for the sake of external propaganda, the Chongqing army attempted to counterattack on the 4th of this month in the three directions of Yidu West Gate and Tudi, but was counterattacked by the Japanese army and retreated. It is estimated that from the 4th to the 9th of this month, in just one week, the new elite units of the Chongqing army, the 74th, 79th, and 44th armies, each with two divisions, totaling 60,000 troops, were completely wiped out. When the Japanese army launched the annihilation battle on the banks of Dongting Lake on May 5th, they first broke through the enemy's 19th Group Army. Later, in the battle in the northern area of Jinshi and Lixian, they defeated the Chongqing 10th Group Army. This was followed by this counter-offensive operation. Therefore, a total of 23 divisions of the Chongqing army were annihilated, reaching 23 divisions, and the Chongqing army's attempt to counterattack was completely crushed.</p>
<p>Hankou, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Central China recently annihilated the 17th Division of the 6th War Zone of Chongqing in the Xiang-E battle area. On the 8th and 9th of this month, they besieged the 2nd Division of the 94th Army of Chongqing near Dameng Tudi, achieving great results. After a certain part of the Japanese army began to transfer, the Chongqing side transferred the 171st and 162nd divisions of the 44th Army (Commander Wang Zetan) in an attempt to move to the south of Huarong and the south of Anxiang County. On the morning of the 4th, they entered Ganjiachang, southwest of Ouchikou, and on the 7th, they arrived at Dameng Tudi and Niulanghu (southwest of Shishou), and attempted to act rashly. The Japanese army unit remained calm, completed preparations, and began operations simultaneously on the 8th in three directions: east, west, and north, advancing from the northwest. Because the Japanese army launched a fierce attack near Hejiatan (30 li west of Ouchikou) and Ganjiachang at 2:00 PM on the 8th, about 1,000 soldiers of the Chongqing 162nd Division, carrying mortars, responded to the Japanese army advancing from the east, west, and north, and attacked Dameng Tudi Qingshibei (25 kilometers southwest of Ouchikou), and completed the encirclement with Dameng Tudi as the center. 20,000 soldiers of the Chongqing 162nd Division and 150th Division attempted to break through, but were attacked by the Japanese army again at night, and were finally completely defeated by the Japanese army at dawn on the 9th.</p>

<p>Bangkok, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Since the 24th Thai Revolution Anniversary is approaching this month, Thai Prime Minister Phibun met with reporters at the Prime Minister's residence on the morning of the 14th and answered the questions raised by the reporters one by one. The records are as follows: Reporter asked, Today is only one ten-day period away from the 11th anniversary of the Thai Revolution. It is expected that Thailand's decisive battle system has been further strengthened. What are the measures taken by the Thai government? Prime Minister Phibun replied, This revolutionary anniversary is of great significance to Thailand, so even under wartime conditions, the government still plans to hold a grand commemorative ceremony to encourage the people to carry out the war with the fighting spirit of the revolution at that time, and to awaken the wartime consciousness of the people, guide the people's efforts, and establish Thailand's self-sufficient economy. It is not only Thailand's own problem, but also has the great significance of building a wing of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. Asked, In order to thoroughly win the Greater East Asia War, the cooperation between Japan and Thailand must be further strengthened. What are the specific strategies of the Prime Minister for Japanese-Thai cooperation? Answered, If Japan and Thailand want to cooperate with each other, the Thai people themselves must first be strong and united. Therefore, I often use all opportunities to focus the people's thoughts on the country. Regarding the specific strategies of Thai-Japanese cooperation, the leaders of the two countries must first cooperate with each other. I still plan to do my best to communicate the ideas of the two countries and continue to cooperate with each other. Asked, What are the necessary measures for Thailand to establish a self-sufficient economy, especially the specific plans for the direction of industrial revitalization? Answered, The most necessary thing for Thailand's economic construction is to enable all the people in the country to have stable production. The implementation guidance of this matter should be started by the village chiefs and tribal chiefs, and a thorough method will be planned for any remote area. Asked, What are the Prime Minister's views on Myanmar's upcoming independence and the Indian issue, and the world situation related to this? Answered, I don't know much about the Myanmar and Indian issues, so I can't say anything rashly. I express my respect for Japan's efforts to help Myanmar's national independence and to liberate the Indian people. I am confident that the Axis powers will win the war. I am very relieved about Japan's position in East Asia, and there is no need to worry about the European war situation. The United States recently said that it is impossible to reverse the war situation. The victory of Greater East Asia has been rock solid.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Bombs Port Moresby</h3>

<h3>Japanese Engineers in New Guinea Display Combat Spirit: Form Suicide Squad, Infiltrate Jungle, Successfully Launch Surprise Attack on Enemy Artillery Positions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The front pages of various newspapers here today all published an article by Mr. Nagai, head of the Army Press Corps, describing how 29 Japanese army engineers were ordered to destroy enemy artillery positions in the dense jungles of New Guinea. It detailed the soldiers' spirit of overcoming all difficulties, infiltrating enemy vehicle positions, destroying enemy heavy artillery positions, and completing their great mission, which was quite moving. The gist is as follows: On the morning of the 23rd of a certain month at 8:00 AM, the Japanese army's Kitajima Company was ordered to attack enemy artillery positions. The order included instructing the unit to form a melee assault team to urgently attack the enemy artillery positions in front of Kiruwa, and to form five melee assault teams, each led by an officer, to infiltrate the enemy front lines or behind enemy lines to search for and attack enemy artillery positions. After receiving this order, Lieutenant Kitajima, the company commander, carefully considered it and selected 29 determined and physically strong volunteers to form a melee assault team, led by Cadet Officer Yoshio Ishida. Amidst the explosions of artillery shells, they shook hands with the company commander and their comrades, and Cadet Officer Ishida led them enthusiastically on their way, crossing the dense jungle towards their destination. Around 7:00 PM on the 23rd, they arrived at a location about four kilometers from the enemy artillery positions. However, because both sides of the Soputa to Kiruwa highway were wetlands with dense and gloomy trees, and aside from two or three small paths connecting to the Kiruwa highway, the entire area was a remote and uninhabited wilderness. To be cautious, the team infiltrated the dense jungle, detoured to the enemy's rear, and launched a surprise attack. Everyone carried explosives, handguns, and hand grenades, and prepared a week's worth of food, groping their way forward. In the dense jungle, even during the day, it was as dark as night, so night travel was impossible. Using a compass and the sound of enemy artillery as their targets, they estimated their direction and advanced. On the 24th, they suddenly lost their way and wandered in the dense jungle all day. It was not until the 25th that they found the road again. The team re-entered the dense jungle and continued to advance, enduring great hardship. Unfortunately, the team leader, Cadet Officer Ishida, was killed in action midway, and the attack team's senior sergeant was also seriously wounded, so the situation was somewhat unfavorable. However, the team continued to advance with an indomitable spirit, and publicly elected First Squad Leader Sergeant Yamamoto as commander, vowing to advance to the death and avenge their fallen team leader. They continued their assault with the determination that when the unit commander fell, the leader would take over, when the leader fell, the team leader would take over, and when the team leader fell, the soldiers would take over, until the last soldier. After bidding farewell to the body of the fallen assault team leader and the seriously wounded sergeant, First Squad Leader Sergeant Yamamoto, under the expectations of the crowd, took over the command of the entire group, uniting their hearts and minds and strengthening their solidarity. Together, they re-entered the enemy artillery positions amidst a rain of bullets, advancing towards their designated target. On the 27th, they reached a point one kilometer from the enemy artillery positions, but they absolutely could not let the enemy discover them, otherwise all their actions would be hindered. Therefore, Sergeant Yamamoto led the entire group in secret advance, holding firm to the determination of "Not entering the tiger's den, how can one seize the tiger's cubs?" They finally infiltrated behind the enemy positions. They then sent three soldiers to sneak into the grass and thoroughly scout the enemy's position, learning that the enemy's artillery positions were built in grass that was over ten feet high, with the artillery bodies all hidden by the grass. They saw that there were six artillery positions, and two large tents were built between the rear and the platform. Opposite the platform, there was a large tent that looked like a headquarters, and there were leftover dishes and lunch boxes, but no enemy soldiers were seen. The brave Japanese soldiers immediately recorded the deployment of the enemy's positions in detail. After the three men completed their reconnaissance, they returned to the original place. Sergeant Yamamoto then reviewed the map in detail with all the members, and at the same time pointed out the bombing targets. They then separately designated each group to bomb six enemy artillery pieces. After receiving the orders, each group broke out of the jungle and advanced to the grassland, approaching to within about 500 meters of the enemy artillery positions. In a flash of light, enemy artillery thundered, and bullets shot out like a storm, but they crawled forward through the grass on their backs, charging into the enemy positions. After a while, the sound of enemy artillery gradually weakened, and they sneaked into the enemy's camp, believing that the opportunity to attack had arrived. They then crept to a stop 20 meters in front of the enemy, each group preparing and quietly waiting for Sergeant Yamamoto's order. After a while, the sound of bullets ceased and daylight reappeared. Sergeant Yamamoto immediately issued an assault order, and everyone stepped through the grass, rushing in like flying. But unfortunately, their actions had been discovered by the enemy, and the enemy soldiers guarding the position fired wildly with automatic rifles from the grass on the right and from behind the position on the left. However, the command squad, which had bypassed the enemy's guard under Sergeant Yamamoto's orders, came out to respond. The first group also threw explosives, breaking through the enemy's rightmost artillery position and circling around to the vicinity of the enemy's tents. They saw lights burning in the tents, and thirty or forty Australian soldiers gathered there. Sergeant Yamamoto then ordered the bombing of the two enemy artillery pieces in front of them. With a deafening roar, the two heavy artillery pieces were instantly shattered. At the same time, they threw bombs at the tents, killing thirty or forty Australian soldiers, and then destroyed two enemy artillery pieces on the side. The enemy soldiers, startled by the three loud explosions, rushed out of the nearby tents, responding with automatic rifles and hand grenades. The two sides then engaged in a melee, followed by several loud metallic sounds from the enemy artillery positions, indicating that several more enemy artillery pieces had been destroyed. At this time, the third group also attacked the designated enemy artillery positions. The enemy fired fiercely with automatic rifles, but they continued to crawl forward. Near the enemy positions, they rushed to the muzzles of the artillery pieces and quickly threw explosives, destroying six enemy artillery pieces, silencing the enemy artillery that had been displaying its power for days. Although they lost their commander on the way, they remained unyielding, uniting under the command of a sergeant and completing their great mission with a spirit of fearless bravery. The spirit of the Japanese army engineers has truly been demonstrated.</p>

<h3>Britain Attempts to Invade Sicily: Frequent Activity in Gibraltar, Germany Builds Strong Defenses Along the Coast, Enemy Ships in the Mediterranean Subjected to Fierce Attacks by German Aircraft</h3>
<p>Lariña, 14th (Central News Agency) - Haisong News Agency: There has been significant activity in Gibraltar in recent days. According to reliable sources, 450 British technical workers arrived there yesterday to accelerate the underground construction project that has been underway for several months. Coastal artillery positions have also been built, and special protection facilities have been put in place, controlled by a single electrical switch. In addition, 43 British landing craft and five large tugboats arrived in Gibraltar yesterday, rumored to be sent to North Africa in preparation for the invasion of Sicily. Currently, only 26 merchant ships are anchored in the port of Gibraltar, with three of them undergoing repairs.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - Major Freitag, an air force reporter for the German News Agency, declared that on Saturday, German heavy bombers intensified their air strikes on the Strait of Sicily and the sea near Pantelleria, bombing the port facilities on the island and the ships anchored nearby, focusing particularly on a few large warships and special landing flat-bottomed boats. Many were directly hit and damaged, including a large armored landing craft, which sank immediately after being hit. In the second German air strike, at least 12 more landing craft in the British and American transport fleets were hit and sunk. In the evening, only the heavy bomber squadrons attacked a British fleet near Lampedusa. Although the British anti-aircraft artillery fiercely resisted, six warships were still hit, one of which exploded violently after being hit. In order to ensure accurate bombing, German aircrews flew very low. The most successful attack was the German bomber squadron's night attack on the port of Bizerte, because the British and Americans had not only docked many large warships there, but also concentrated a large number of landing craft. At least 20 of these were sunk by German aircraft. Only one German aircraft failed to return.</p>
<p>Europe's Fortress is Solid as a Rock: British Newspaper Admits Invasion is Not Easy</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - Haisong News Agency: The British "Economic Weekly" stated that Europe's fortress is solid as a rock and must be broken at a significant sacrifice. Although destructive actions are occasionally found in Europe, most people are still working peacefully, fulfilling their duties. German officials in various parts of Europe travel and work without difficulty. The mobilization of foreign manpower has undoubtedly been successful for the Germans, and Germany has now obtained the workers it needs. Moreover, Germany's anti-Bolshevik military operations have not failed. The effects of the Allied air strikes may be exaggerated. The main target of the British and Americans is the Ruhr region, but the industry in that region represents less than one-fifth of Germany's total industrial capacity, and the coal and steel produced in that region only account for one-third of Germany's total industry. Germany's defense industries are located in areas further east, including the new steel mill in Salzgitter, the largest tank factory in Fallersleben, the chemical plant in Leuna, the synthetic rubber industry in the Sudetenland, and new factories in Upper Silesia and southern Poland. Therefore, concentrated bombing is unlikely to achieve the desired results. Germany's fighting power and morale have not collapsed. Strong defenses have been built along the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts and equipped with heavy artillery.</p>
<h3>British Fleet Commander Cunningham Visits Ankara</h3>
<p>Ankara, 14th (Central News Agency) - Admiral Cunningham, commander of the British Eastern Mediterranean Fleet, arrived in Ankara yesterday by plane.

<p>Ankara, 13th (Central News Agency) - Haisong News Agency: Rear Admiral Sir Cunningham, the newly appointed British naval commander of the Eastern Mediterranean, will be here from Saturday to Tuesday. It is not yet known when he will be received by the Turkish President. It is expected that the discussions between British officials and Turkish military authorities will not be made public. According to political figures here, the discussions will be about the transportation of various raw materials granted to Turkey by the British and Americans from southern Anatolia to the northwestern ports of that province. For this reason, the anti-Axis countries will allow Turkey to use cargo ships.</p>
<h3>British and American Aircraft Attack Germany: Loss of Thirty-Nine Aircraft</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - The British Air Ministry announced on the 13th that the British bomber squadrons lost 24 aircraft during the bombing of the industrial city of Bochum in western Germany on the 12th.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - Major Freitag, an air force reporter for the German News Agency, stated that on Sunday, 15 American heavy bombers were shot down by German anti-aircraft artillery while attempting to attack Kiel and Bremen. Although the American aircraft approached the coast at high altitude, they were discovered by the Germans over the North Sea and effectively attacked before reaching their targets. Therefore, most of the American aircraft were forced to drop their bombs into the sea or the wilderness. A few aircraft that reached Kiel and Bremen could only drop bombs randomly in two places, and only residential areas were damaged.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to today's Reuters report, the Allies lost a total of 101 aircraft in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East during the past week. The most aircraft were lost during the night attacks on Düsseldorf and Münster in Germany on Friday night and the night attack on Bochum on Saturday. This number includes eight American aircraft.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London: The British Air Ministry announced on the 14th that the German Air Force bombed the London area on the night of the 13th, while another squadron bombed various cities on the southwestern coast, which suffered considerable damage and casualties.

<h3>Britain Mobilizes Thirty-Two Million Men</h3>

<h3>Polish Leader Visits Iraq</h3>

Upon his arrival, representatives of the Iraqi government, as well as senior American and Polish officials stationed in Iraq, were present to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Italian Politician Comments on Italy's Future in the War: Difficulties Were Expected Long Ago, Determined to Strive for Final Victory</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency) - Stefani News Agency reports that Essen, a famous political problem expert, wrote an article in the newspaper commenting on Italy's participation in the war, saying that Italy had great difficulty in maintaining neutrality in this war. The most natural way for Western countries to attack Germany is through Italy, so Italy has no choice but to join the battle, otherwise it will sit and wait for defeat. Mussolini obviously did not expect to easily win in a short period of time. When Italy declared war, Mussolini knew that the plutocratic countries would inevitably oppose Italy's desire to achieve a position that conformed to the greatness of the Italian nation and its desire for Italy's security. For many years, Mussolini has not imagined that Italy's path would be easy. Italy's declaration of war on the plutocratic countries has proven that, from any point of view, Italy's fate must be determined by war. Even if Italy maintains neutrality, if the Western countries win, Italy will inevitably lose its status as a great power and will not be able to exist in a tolerable situation. Italy has chosen the only path that any other great power could choose in the same circumstances, between remaining a great power or becoming a vassal. On the third anniversary of Italy's participation in the war, coinciding with the country's most serious period in modern history, this was not unexpected by Mussolini and the Italian government. The difficulties of this war were expected long ago, but Italy's situation is not as critical as many people think. Italy's spiritual resources have been mobilized on an unprecedented scale, and Italy's will and strength to resist may still shock the world. What will happen in the future is not necessary to speculate. The Axis powers may attack Sardinia and Sicily one after another, but it is currently impossible to attempt to attack the Italian mainland. Here, Italy's enemies will encounter enormous difficulties and may suffer a disastrous defeat. The turning point of the war may be here. Italy, under the current circumstances, does not hesitate between retreating or being determined to win. The Italians have decided to strive for victory. Mussolini's words "We will surely return" come from the hearts of the Italians. Those who think that Italy is not prepared to experience difficulties must know that the decisions of most wars are not due to accidental material superiority, but due to spiritual factors. In this struggle, the spiritual factor is on Italy's side.</p>

<h3>Zoot Suit Riots in California, USA</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Los Angeles: A conflict occurred here on the 10th between zoot suit gangs and American soldiers, which later spread to various cities in southern California. The authorities have begun active investigations. On the 12th, a large-scale brawl occurred again in Los Angeles, in which the zoot suit gangs joined forces with members of the Women's Auxiliary Corps, targeting American army and navy soldiers and marines. A major melee broke out, resulting in many injuries. The state authorities, unable to cope with the continuous riots in various parts of California, intervened to mediate between the two sides. However, in the past week, the number of people slightly or seriously injured or killed due to the riots has reached 125, which has in fact become a major social problem.</p>
<h3>Japan's Naval Battles and the Battle of Jutland (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Masanori Ito</p>
<p>(4) Superiority of Naval Mine Night Battles</p>
<p>Even after sinking about 80% of the enemy's main battleships during the main artillery battle on May 27th, Marshal Togo was not satisfied with this overwhelming victory. He still believed it was necessary to annihilate one first-class battleship, three second-line battleships, three heavy cruisers, six light cruisers, three coastal defense ships, and nine destroyers that were damaged and attempting to flee to Vladivostok. Commander Togo had already prepared this plan, which was the so-called "Seven Combined Battles" plan. The first battle was the main artillery battle, the second was the naval mine night battle, the third was the main artillery battle the following day, and the fourth was the main artillery night battle. Attacks were to be continued in this order, with the aim of sinking all the enemy ships by the fourth day. The second battle began at 7:30 PM on the 27th. The 1st Destroyer Squadron, 2nd Destroyer Squadron, and 3rd Torpedo Boat Unit from the north, and the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Destroyer Squadrons from the east, and the 1st, 10th, 15th, 17th, and 20th Torpedo Boat Squadrons from the south, surrounded the remaining enemy fleet from three sides and engaged in close-quarters combat. The enemy, led by the battleship "Nikolai I," divided ten ships into two rows and sped north, encountering intense attacks from our three naval mine squadrons. The battleship "Navarin" was sunk, and the battleships "Sisoi Veliky" and "Admiral Nakhimov" were severely damaged (both sinking the following morning), with losses of this magnitude.</p>
<p>The main fleet, hindered by twilight, withdrew from the battlefield at 7:20 PM, but the naval mine battle had already begun at 7:30 PM. The enemy, encountering our thorough plan and lightning-fast pursuit, did not have a moment's respite. As night deepened, they thought they could rest a little, but this sweet dream lasted only ten minutes, which was truly pathetic. However, this naval mine battle was launched recklessly in the vast ocean with waves over ten feet high. Our hundred-ton torpedo boats were rocking and rolling at sixty degrees. In such turbulence, the compass was virtually useless, the soldiers on board were completely soaked in water, and the telescopes were completely blurred by a layer of water vapor, making navigation nearly impossible. However, forty small ships, with the determination to die alongside the enemy's large ships, rapidly approached, and after four hours of repeated attacks, they achieved the aforementioned great results.</p>
<p>Originally, naval mine night battles were one of the special strengths of the Japanese Navy, but the reason for this so-called special strength was the brave determination to die alongside the enemy. Although there were technical differences between the Japanese and British naval mine squadrons in the Battle of Jutland, their spirit of bravery and skillful fighting was incomparably different.</p>
<p>(5) Confidence and Terror in Night Battles</p>
<p>The difference in soldiers was certainly a factor, but the main difference was the fundamental difference in the commanders. Jellicoe, at 9:00 PM (the light intensity was the same as in the Sea of Japan at 7:30 PM), ordered his destroyer fleet to line up five miles behind the main fleet, in case the German naval mine squadron launched torpedoes from behind. The British naval mine squadron's awareness of the German main fleet was due to accidental contact and acted according to Jellicoe's intentions. In contrast, Marshal Togo never thought of using the naval mine squadron to protect himself during the Battle of the Sea of Japan, but always ordered the naval mine squadron to desperately launch torpedoes at the enemy.</p>
<p>Most importantly, "night battle," from the Marshal's perspective, was a necessary means of annihilation, and he adopted it with great expectation and confidence. Jellicoe, on the other hand, believed that night battle was a risky fighting method against the enemy and used excuses to avoid it. He had a saying, "Very Largely matter of chance," which has already been introduced in the description of the naval battle. What war is there if you lose "Chance"? Furthermore, his words reveal a very womanish and childish excuse. We will translate a section from his book "Grand Fleet" to prove this.</p>
<p>"The German naval organization is outstanding for night battles. Their identification signals are particularly good. Ours are almost nonexistent. Their searchlights are stronger than ours. The last argument is that their nighttime gunnery is extremely skilled (referring to their aiming and firing speed). I believe we must learn from the German Navy regarding night battles."</p>
<p>In this way, the naval battle between Germany and Britain was simply a contest between teacher and student, so there was no hope of victory even in ten thousand attempts. This was the reason why Jellicoe did not engage in night battles. He believed that the enemy was so capable and skillful that he feared them even in a full-scale battle. Not underestimating the enemy can be considered an advantage of the British Navy.</p>
<p>Why was there such a great difference between Marshal Togo and Jellicoe? During the Battle of the Sea of Japan, among the first-class ships of the two armies, Japan had four and Russia had five, and four of Russia's five ships, such as the "Oslyabya," "Emperor Alexander III," "Knyaz Suvorov," and "Oryol," were superior in performance to Japan's "Mikasa" (at the time, Russia's four ships were the most excellent in the world). Foreign critics had already pointed this out, but Marshal Togo never mentioned this point. He only thought about completely defeating these warships. There is naturally a world of difference in character between a general who is determined to completely defeat the enemy and a general who allows the enemy to escape completely.</p>
<p>(6) German Admiral Also Revealed the Truth</p>
<p>Evading the main night battle would be a trivial matter, but having over seventy destroyers to provide an advantage and not carrying out a night attack is a very incomprehensible mystery. German Fleet Commander Admiral Scheer, after 9:00 PM, secretly pondered that he had to break through the British fleet with the main battleships and head straight to his base, but he was also worried about night battles. Scheer said in his Battle of Jutland diary:</p>
<p>"If the enemy attacks our army with their powerful main force in the evening twilight, and then uses destroyers to carry out a naval mine night attack, then it will force our fleet to steer further west, and materially force us to engage in battle the next day. He clearly has this power of execution."</p>
<p>Jellicoe was the one who had this power of execution but did not execute it. Admiral Scheer carefully guarded against that power of execution, but the British unexpectedly did not engage in night attacks, and avoided night battles, so Scheer's fleet received such an unexpected gain and returned safely to its base.</p>
<p>But Jellicoe's avoidance of night battles is equivalent to automatically giving up a heaven-sent opportunity for victory. This is as clear as the sun and moon in anyone's eyes. However, the British naval bulletin said, "The Commander-in-Chief decided very rightly ont to fight nignt action." In reality, the Commander-in-Chief evaded night battles, and only this judgment is appropriate, but evading night battles was praised as being correct. If they had not praised it and simply described it, it would have been the end of it, but praising it as very appropriate means that the British Admiralty cannot avoid sharing some responsibility for the strategic error. In short, the foundation of their strategic thinking is safety first, which is acceptable in exercises, but this kind of thinking cannot be held in actual combat. If Marshal Togo were Jellicoe, he would have done the exact opposite.</p>
<p>The heroic posture of the enemy's Marshal standing on the deck during the Battle of the Sea of Japan is a war photograph that all Japanese people must see at least once. However, a painting of Jellicoe, calm and composed in the 13-inch command tower of the "Iron Duke," cannot be seen anywhere in Britain. There is truly a reason for this.

<h3>Director Iwazaki Gave a Banquet for the Press Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Colonel Harushige Iwazaki, Director of the Press Department of the Japanese Military Dispatch Headquarters in China and Director of the Press Department of the Japanese Army Department in Shanghai, was transferred to an important position. The central propaganda agencies in Shanghai, the local press, and the cultural community jointly held a farewell banquet for him a few days ago. Director Iwazaki then went to Beijing to prepare everything. On the 13th, he took a train from Beijing to Shanghai and held a banquet at 12:30 PM yesterday (the 14th) on the 9th floor of the Cathay Hotel to thank the local propaganda agencies, the press, and the cultural community. The situation was grand and enthusiastic. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Guests Arrived: A grand banquet was held on time. Director Iwazaki personally led his colleagues Lieutenant Colonel Shio, Major Yamaga, Trustee Akahoshi, Trustee Ota, etc., and warmly thanked and advised the representatives of the central propaganda offices in Shanghai and the local news media. Those who were invited and attended included Feng Jie, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department, Secretary Ma Zongyao, Tang Liangli, Director of the International Propaganda Bureau, Li Zhaozhi, Director of the Zhong Youcai Electrical Inspection Association, Xu Liqiu, Yan Jiabao, and Lei Zhenyuan of the China Daily, Chen Binhe of the Shen Bao, Yuan Shu, Weng Yongqing, and Lu Feng of the Xin Zhongguo Bao, Kiyomasa Hidakamo of the New Shen Bao, Lu Guangjie of the Ping Bao, Zheng Hongyan and Cheng Zhongquan of the Xinwen Bao, Zong Jingze and Zhu Yongkang of the Guomin Xinwen, Wu Peizhi, Yang Huilang, and Gan Nailiang of the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency, Ren Yunpeng of the Shanghai News Federation, Zheng Yu'an of the Zhonghua Daobao, and Huang Tianshi of the China Film United Company, etc. During the banquet, Director Iwazaki first gave a speech, followed by Director Feng, who stood up on behalf of everyone to express his gratitude. They raised their glasses to wish each other well. The banquet ended at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, with the guests and hosts enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>Iwazaki's Speech: Director Iwazaki said in his speech, "As I am about to leave Shanghai, I am hosting this small gathering to show my sincere gratitude for everyone's past assistance. I am very happy to receive your messages of condolence and congratulations. I have been working in China for two and a half years and I am grateful for your assistance, which has enabled me to complete my duties. I would like to express my gratitude. However, after I leave, the reporting work in Shanghai will be handled by Lieutenant Colonel Shio. I hope that you will continue to assist Lieutenant Colonel Shio as you have assisted me in the past and work together to promote the mission. The current situation is becoming increasingly serious, and the duties of reporting are becoming increasingly difficult. In order to overcome all difficulties, we must work twice as hard to complete the mission successfully as soon as possible. Finally, I wish you all good health and a bright future."</p>
<p>Representative's Reply: Director Feng Jie replied on behalf of everyone, saying, "When the news of Director Iwazaki's promotion was announced, all parties in Shanghai expressed their infinite regret. The propaganda agencies, the press, and the cultural community in Shanghai held a grand farewell party. Before taking office, Director Iwazaki has given us another opportunity to talk and entertain us today. I cannot express in a few words the expectations of Director Iwazaki and the difficult-to-give-up enthusiasm. Everyone present has received assistance from Director Iwazaki during his tenure to carry out his mission. On the day of the previous farewell banquet, we were filled with the sadness of parting, and today we are still so. The Director just said that the situation is serious, and we should do our best to work twice as hard to live up to the Director's wishes. I now feel that today's departure is not a farewell, but the beginning of a gathering, because he has completed the first half of his mission in China and Greater East Asia. He first engaged in the integration of propaganda agencies related to China and provided assistance to them, so that the second half of his mission is our hope that the Director will give us assistance again after taking office. I firmly believe that he will give us greater assistance in the future. During the Director's tenure, Lieutenant Colonel Shio, Major Yamaga, and his colleagues have all made the same efforts as the Director. The Director just announced that Lieutenant Colonel Shio will be in charge, and we are all very happy to hear this. Lieutenant Colonel Shio is one of the people who follows the Japanese spirit and understands the Director best, and we have been working with Lieutenant Colonel Shio for a long time and know that he is a person who is familiar with Chinese learning and history and the ideals of Greater East Asia. We will not disappoint the Director's expectations, and we will cooperate sincerely with Lieutenant Colonel Shio to shoulder our responsibilities. I wish the Director all the best and welcome Lieutenant Colonel Shio."</p>

<h3>Police and Baojia Authorities Inspect Citizen Certificates</h3>
<p>In order to promote the highest performance of the public security system, the police and baojia authorities in the city and the two concession areas are now stepping up the inspection of citizen certificates or identity cards to prevent unscrupulous elements from using counterfeit or unreleased identity documents to mix into the jurisdiction and engage in illegal activities. The police and baojia personnel are paying attention to travelers entering and leaving trains and harbors and pedestrians on the streets, and even checking households. If they find that the passes and identity cards carried by the detained persons are suspicious, or if they do not carry any documents, they will be immediately interrogated.

<h3>Sponsoring the Repair of Huang Daichi's Tomb</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>After experiencing many hardships, on the 10th of this month, I was invited by Mr. Binhe to a drink, where I met my old friend Wu Hufan. Overjoyed at our reunion, the first thing he told me was about the discovery of Huang Daichi's tomb and asked me to jointly initiate its repair and restoration. Huang Gongwang (1269-1355), also known as Zijiǔ, Yifeng, and Daichi Daoren, was a well-known master of the Southern School. His paintings had two styles: one in light green, with a powerful brushstroke; the other in ink wash, with extremely sparse techniques. He drew inspiration from Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran from a distance, and from Li Cheng of Yingqiu and Fan Kuan of Huayuan from nearby. He swept away the paintings of the Han, Jin, Six Dynasties, Tang, and Song dynasties, focusing on expressing the landscape in his heart. He found joy in life through his serene and simple brushstrokes. It is said that the ancients found pleasure in painting, and this started with Daichi. He was truly a master of the art world, and the repair of his tomb cannot be delayed. In addition to donating one thousand yuan myself, I have also asked Dr. Ding Shikang to donate one thousand yuan as an initiative. I have traveled extensively in Europe, visiting famous cities such as Rome, Paris, London, and Berlin. Europeans hold the remains and tombs of art giants in high esteem, building magnificent structures for posterity to pay their respects. For example, Raphael's coffin and the coffin of Victor Emmanuel II, the founder of Italy, are both housed in the Pantheon in Rome (the national burial ground), showing great respect. Daichi's art is unparalleled throughout history. Now that my friend Hufan has made this enlightening discovery, all artists and art lovers should rally to support it.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Modern Japanese Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Liu Hanru</p>
<p>The "Modern Japanese Painting Exhibition" organized by the Japan International Culture Promotion Association opened yesterday (the 14th) at the Da Hsin Art Gallery with a preview, inviting guests from all sectors of the city to participate. The public exhibition will run from today until the 20th, with free admission.</p>
<p>A month ago, the Japan Imperial Art Association held a Japanese painting exhibition at the Pudong Fellow Association building on Avenue Edward VII in this city. While there were some excellent works among the exhibits, they did not match the brilliance of this Modern Japanese Painting Exhibition. Furthermore, the works in the Japan Imperial Art Association exhibition were priced for sale, while the Modern Japanese Painting Exhibition aims to promote artistic exchange between China and Japan and enhance the feelings between the two nations. The exhibits are absolutely not for sale, so the two exhibitions have completely different purposes.</p>
<p>All the works on display at the New Art Gallery, about 70 in total, are excellent pieces by first-class Japanese masters. The variety is dazzling and the beauty is endless. Based on personal preference, the most exquisite pieces include the following:</p>
<p>(1) No. 24, "Little Dew," by Domoto Insho, uses ink and light color to depict autumn scenery, maple leaves, bamboo, a child, and a temple. The composition is skillful, the brushstrokes are free, and the autumn wind seems to whisper.</p>
<p>(2) No. 3, "Autumn Clearing in a Mountain Village," by Kawai Gyokudo. Like the previous piece, it depicts autumn scenery, but the brushstrokes and materials have their own characteristics. The composition is particularly elegant and serene, with Western painting colors. The bamboo is depicted very delicately, retaining the ancient style. The combination of trees and bamboo is harmonious. Reading this painting is like tasting mellow wine, while reading the previous painting is like hearing the chanting of monks in a temple.</p>
<p>(3) No. 5, "Mountain and Sea Delicacies," by Kobo Gyoun. The artist is the leader of the Southern Painting Revival in Japan. This piece is a realistic work, depicting fish and taro. The colors are bright. The words, "Fresh fish from the sea before the railing, fresh vegetables from the fields behind the house," are very elegant.</p>
<p>(4) No. 39, "Marching Horse," by Kishi Tadao, is completely in the Japanese style, depicting the scene of Japanese warriors setting out to conquer the barbarians 1,500 years ago. The horses are plump, the men are strong, and the wind is fierce. The spirit of the samurai is fully expressed. The colors are exquisite, and the details are remarkable.</p>
<p>(5) No. 30, "Waterfowl," by Gokura Senjin. The artist is one of the modern painters. The feathers of the waterfowl are depicted in ink wash. One bird is diving into the water to forage, while another is leaping on the surface. The posture is elegant and the ancient style is abundant.</p>
<p>(6) No. 2, "Dawn," by Kiyokata Kaburagi. The artist is an elder of the Japan Art Institute and has received the Order of Culture. "Dawn" depicts the first rays of the sun shining on Mount Fuji. The white snow reflects the sky, and clear smoke fills the mountains below. The view from the top is extremely majestic, entrusting the spirit of Japan and East Asia to the sacred peak of Mount Fuji, symbolizing the light of East Asia. The composition and brushstrokes are both excellent. The powerful brushstrokes are awe-inspiring. It is said that the painting is done with Chinese pine soot ink, so it has a particularly charming quality. It is said that the artist has a large collection of Chinese ink sticks, which allows his works to have unique characteristics.</p>
<p>There are several exceptional pieces included in the special exhibits, including:</p>
<p>(1) "Monkeys," by Hashimoto Kansetsu. Hashimoto's name is not unfamiliar to China (this newspaper has translated and published his work "Shanghai Miscellany" in the "Free Talk" section). He has traveled extensively in China and has frequent exchanges with famous Chinese artists. "Monkeys" is his representative work. He uses vigorous ink brushstrokes to depict two black monkeys jumping on an ancient pine tree, set against a snowy landscape, devoid of any mundane atmosphere. It is said that Hashimoto's name became famous with the creation of "Monkeys," and he became a first-class Japanese master through his hard work, not by chance.</p>
<p>(2) "Domestic Rabbit and Monkeys," by Takeuchi Seiho, depicts three monkeys on a shelf, each with a different posture: one playing, one looking suspiciously, and the other looking wistfully. The emotions are vividly expressed on the canvas. The nine rabbits in the pen are very cute and are truly exceptional works.</p>
<p>(3) "Wheat Harvest," by Nishioka Itto, depicts a bundle of new wheat being brought to the threshing ground. Two calves sniff the wheat on the side, and several stalks of grain are placed under the calves' feet. Several branches of flowers are interspersed, creating an extremely clever composition. The artist is one of the elders of the Japanese art world.</p>
<p>Overall, all the exhibits can be called outstanding works. The above-mentioned pieces are those that I personally particularly admire and have recorded at random to express my appreciation.</p>
<p>Famous local painters Qian Shoutie, Zheng Wuchang, and Sun Xueni all visited the exhibition yesterday. Qian praised Hashimoto Kansetsu's work in particular.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Frugality Movement</h3>
<p>It is said, "If the country is extravagant, show it frugality." This shows that frugality is a reaction against extravagance during peacetime. Currently, the country faces numerous difficulties, the world is impoverished, prices are soaring, and the people are struggling to survive. Therefore, "saving and consumption" has become one of the five major guidelines of the government's wartime economic policy, indicating that frugality is an adaptation to wartime poverty. While war is painful for the masses, it can be a rare opportunity for a few who are in safe areas and making speculative profits from the nation's difficulties. Therefore, frugality is also a reaction against the extravagant lifestyle of those who are profiting from the nation's difficulties during wartime.</p>
<p>Looking back at history, we know that frugality has always been the orthodox ideology, while advocating extravagance has been a heretical concept. Zeng Guofan once said, "It is easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality." Sun Chuanfang, as the commander-in-chief of the five-province allied forces, issued a "Frugality Pact," and the Executive Yuan of the National Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for Government Personnel to Eliminate Wasteful Customs" in the 25th year of the Republic of China. Recently, this newspaper, in the spirit of "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation," has proposed a "Convention for Saving on Banquets" in an attempt to restrain the extravagant trends in Shanghai, even if only slightly. This is just one aspect of the long history of frugality.</p>
<p>Hu Linyi, one of the famous ministers of the Restoration during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi reigns of the late Qing Dynasty, once said, "It is essential to strictly prohibit the vulgar customs of officialdom's social interactions, and to encourage all officials to be honest and simple, and to eliminate vanity." Therefore, his political achievements were second only to Zeng Guofan. If he had lived longer, his achievements might have surpassed Zeng Guofan's.</p>
<p>Frugality in peacetime must start with the political circles to set an example. However, the current situation is different. Government employees are paid poorly, and the extravagant feasting in political circles has subsided. Therefore, frugality in wartime must start with the business community, as those who profit from the nation's difficulties are mostly hoarders in the business community, and those who spend money like water are also from this group. In the past, the social hierarchy in China was "scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants," but now it has changed to "merchants, artisans, farmers, and scholars." Therefore, the target of the frugality movement is the business community, and the responsibility for saving the declining social customs and the economic crisis also lies with the business community.</p>
<h3>Actively Rectifying Financial Institutions - The Bankers' Association Implements Self-Discipline</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has decided to strengthen financial institutions and has made a decision to reorganize small banks. Banks with a total capital of less than three million yuan will not be allowed to operate. The implementation measures will be announced soon. As a result, banks have recently been scrambling to increase their capital or discuss mergers, as this is the only way for them to continue to exist.</p>
<p>Joint Operations are Very Possible</p>
<p>According to a report from the Guofeng News Agency, based on inquiries with people in the Chinese banking industry, bank mergers are the most necessary measure. However, considering the individual characteristics of each bank, mergers may be difficult. Therefore, it seems more likely that banks will form lending syndicates at any time to engage in joint operations, rather than mergers. However, the Bankers' Association is currently working to establish normal relations between banks and agriculture, industry, and commerce, and is engaging in self-discipline. It also hopes that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry can promptly provide appropriate supervision, and that any banks with illegal business practices, regardless of their capital, should be decisively dealt with.</p>
<p>New Banks Established in May and June</p>
<p>Most of the newly established banks recently have capital of more than 300,000 yuan. For example, among the twelve new banks established in April and May, eight have capital of 300,000 yuan, while only four have capital of less than 300,000 yuan. The names and capital of each bank are listed below: Nanjing Xingye 300 (unit: 10,000 yuan), Tongye 300, Yonghe 250, Donghua 300, China Porcelain Industry 300, Shi Kang 300, Tonghua 300, Yitai 300, Jinde 200, Fuzhong 250, China Wine Industry 200, China Qinye 300.</p>
<p>General Situation of Bank Capital Increase</p>
<p>In addition, among the banks that have increased their capital in the past two months, only one has a new capital of less than 300,000 yuan. The details are as follows: Pudong Bank 100 (old capital, unit: 10,000 yuan) - 500 (new capital), Great Wall 60-300, Dalai 50-100, Shanghai Industry and Commerce 200-500, Shanghai Shiye 100-500, Asia 100-500, Yongming 200-500, Shenzhou Shiye 150-500, Taihe Xing 60-500, Jiangzhe Enterprise 150-500, China Industry 400-600, Dakang 100-500, Danan 200-500, Daxin 200-500, Ruihua 200-500.</p>
<h3>The Central Bank and Others Regulate Financial Markets at the End of June</h3>
<p>In view of the approaching end of June settlement period, the Central Bank of China and the Silver and Money Industry Reserve Treasury, in order to regulate interbank finance and stabilize the market, are making every effort to handle interbank lending and discounting to facilitate turnover. (1) Short-term interbank lending by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China is limited to real estate in the concession area, joint bank promissory notes, public treasury certificates, non-speculative and non-essential goods, and securities as collateral, with a maximum term of three days. (2) The Silver and Money Industry Reserve Treasury will provide lending to Mogadishu. Member banks and pawnshops can apply for lending with property as collateral. The amount of lending will be determined based on the evaluated value, and the term will be set at ten days. (3) The deposit reserve funds paid by each bank and pawnshop can be guaranteed by the association to apply for discounting from the Central Bank of China, temporarily based on the principle of discounting 70% of the current interest rate for each bank and pawnshop. After the capital positions of each bank and pawnshop have been regulated by the Central Bank of China, their own foundations have become more robust. All current accounts can be handled as usual. Under extremely cautious conditions, lending for legitimate needs in various industries can be accommodated. (1) Lending for the purchase of agricultural products, such as wheat, new tea, rapeseed, and beans, will be provided as much as possible, but only to the relevant industries. (2) Loans for industrial and commercial enterprises that need to increase production will be granted after review. (3) Loans due at the end of June, regardless of credit or collateral, may be extended if there are legitimate reasons and no violations of laws and regulations. Therefore, the entire financial system in Shanghai has remained stable after direct regulation, and industrial and commercial enterprises will be able to safely navigate this end-of-June settlement period.</p>
<h3>The Central Bank and the Bank of Communications Handle Wheat Loans</h3>
<p>The new wheat harvest in the major producing areas will begin around the 20th of this month. This year, the weather and rainfall have been favorable, and the wheat season has been bountiful. The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Commercial and Trade Commission has established branch offices in nine regions, including Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhu, to strengthen the work of purchasing wheat. All of these offices are required to complete their organization by today (the 15th). Regarding the funds for purchasing wheat, an agreement has been signed with the Central Bank of China to designate the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications to provide loans of 100 million yuan in June and July to meet the needs of purchasing wheat funds. It is reported that these wheat loans will be handled in the form of commercial acceptance drafts, and sellers can rediscount the commercial drafts they issue with the Central Bank of China.</p>
<h3>The Check Clearing System Will Not Be Abolished</h3>
<p>Since the Central Reserve Bank of China took over the Clearing House on June 1 and handled exchange clearing, checks deposited by the same industry are treated the same as cash, so the future of check clearing will disappear. However, the Joint Bank Association believes that check clearing is still necessary when the money supply is tight, so it requested that the system continue to exist. It is reported that after consultations this year, it was decided that check clearing will still exist in principle, but it must be operated under the management of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>The Central Savings Society Issues Regulations for Special Savings Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>In order to encourage people to save, the Central Savings Society has issued regulations for the issuance of special savings lottery tickets in accordance with the provisions of the charter. The tickets are currently being printed and are expected to be issued in early July. The lottery will be drawn publicly in Shanghai at the end of September. The first batch of lottery tickets will be exclusively managed by Tianyun Company in this city, which will distribute them to various sales outlets.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchant Registration Fees Have Been Determined</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association has been handling the registration of grain merchants on behalf of the Ministry of Food for the past few days. The regulations stipulate that merchants with capital of 200,000 yuan or more are classified as Grade A. The registration fee for miscellaneous grain vendors is 1,000 yuan. Those with capital of 100,000 yuan or more are classified as Grade B, with a registration fee of 600 yuan. Those with capital of 50,000 yuan or more are classified as Grade C, with a registration fee of 400 yuan. Distributors with capital of 100,000 yuan or more are classified as Grade A, with a registration fee of 600 yuan for rice distributors. Those with capital of 50,000 yuan or more are classified as Grade B, with a registration fee of 400 yuan. Those with capital of 20,000 yuan or more are classified as Grade C, with a registration fee of 200 yuan.</p>
