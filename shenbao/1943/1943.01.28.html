<p>社評</p>
<h3>祝上海新聞聯合會成立</h3>
<p>本市中日各報社爲了宣揚大東亞主義，和中日兩國國策，硏究新聞事業之發展，及發揮其性能，達成新聞事業爲時代先驅的使命起見，共同發起組織上海新聞聯合會，已於昨日正式成立。這是上海新聞界自動的組織，這是上海新聞界團結的新紀元，這也是中國以至中日兩國新聞界自動團結起來的第一聲。我們趁這個機會，很誠懇的提出下列幾點願望：</p>
<p>第一，過去上海是中國全國文化的中心，也是全國新聞界最發達的城市；但是，過去各自爲政，各謀發展，其間對於國家社會，及文化敎育，雖然曾經分別的盡過力量，而其間各不相顧，力量分散，不能形成改造社會翼贊國策的一種力量，却不能不令人遺憾。現在上海新聞聯合會正式成立了，從此上海新聞界有了自己的組織，彼此可以互助合作，集中力量，共謀發展，例如在立論方面，在充實內容方面，可以收互相協助，分工合作之效。此外如在節省紙張，縮小廣吿篇幅，統一售價等等，都可以針對戰時實際情形，齊一步伐，共濟時艱。所以，上海新聞聯合會的成立，無論在積極方面，或在消極方面，都有劃時代的意義。我們在這裏，首先要感謝大陸新報社長尾坂先生最大的努力，獲得這種偉大的成功。又當感謝中日兩國當局與各報主持者的遠見，能在共濟時艱的大前提下，贊助協力，使上海新聞界從此團結一致。同時，我們每一個新聞從業者，從此以後，應更進一步的携手合作，共同爲完成新時代新聞界的使命而奮　。</p>
<p>第二，老實說，中國的新聞事業，比較日本落後至少有二十年。現在上海新聞界有了空前的團結，這是上海新聞界的一大革命。我們竭誠希望凡我同業，必須互相照顧，互相鼓勵，大家視辦報爲一種社會事業，一種文化敎育事業，一種輔翼政府革新政治的事業，共謀國家社會人類文化的進步。大家抱着大無畏的精神，爲人民作喉舌，為政府作諍友，爲社會作導師，爲時在作先驅，中國新國事業首先發軔的是上海，歷史最悠久，發展最廣大的也是上海，因此，上海新聞界就不免有着自負。不過，由於過分的自負，却造成了上海一小部份報界故步自封，不知改進的風氣，陣礙了報紙的進步，也就造成了落後的因素，這眞是上海新聞界最嚴重的現象之一。現在有了共同的組織，有了團結的力量，我們在這裏竭誠希望一改過去自滿自負的態度，大家要有虛心學習的態度，而且還應該向先進各國尤其是日本的新聞界學習，大家一面加强自我批評的精神，矯正錯誤，一面要學習他人長處優點，迎頭趕上去，只有這樣，才不致落後，才能在新時代擔負起新聞界的使命。</p>
<p>第三，目前上海報紙，還不够充分表現戰時精神，這也是無庸諱言的。例如戰時日本的報紙都沒有娛樂廣吿和低級　味的文字了；更沒有刊載與國家民族與文化無關的花花綠綠的誘引讀者趨向消極和享樂的文字了；絶沒有成爲賭博舞塲以及其他銷金窟迷魂陣的宣傳者了。如果，在戰時辦報，未能充分表現戰時情緒，喚起人民覺醒，實在有違新時代新聞業者的使命。我們這種「春秋責備賢者」的話，並不把自己例外，我們希望今後大家在共同的組織之下，互相協力，携手共進，充分表現戰時新聞的精神。</p>
<p>最後，我們認爲戰時報紙，必須擁護國策，接受政府的統制，這是任何國家沒有例外的。我們在有了共同的組織之後，自然更將盡力團結在一起，爲政府良善的法令和國策而盡宣揚的責任。同時，我們更希望兩國當局充分扶助新聞事業。因爲一個國家一方面必須有基礎健全的民營報紙，一方面政府加以合理的領導，只有扶助重於領導，領導重於統制，只有使扶助領導，與統制滴當的兼籌並顧，方能發揮戰時新聞的効力。例如日本的朝日，每日，讀賣等均爲最完善的民營報紙，因爲戰前的日本政府能加以充分的扶助，戰後的日本政府能加以合理的統制，所以今日才能使報紙發揮共宣揚國策指導人民，和發揚戰時文化的偉大使命。若是所有報紙都成爲政府的喉舌，那麼只要公文吿示和命令就够了，爲什麽還要報紙？正因爲政府必須經過報紙，採納輿論，接受民意，才能決定良善和萬全的政策。同時也只有經過報紙，闡揚政策，指導人民，才能期待政策之貫澈。所以，我們在向新聞界諸同業祝勉之餘，更期待兩國當局給我們以不斷的扶助和指導。</p>

<p>瑞典京城廿七日海通社電　據報紙載稱、羅美爾上將之部隊、已越過馬勒斯防綫、德義聯軍殿後部隊、在的黎波里西北角、竭力阻止英軍、軸心軍顯然携有大批地雷、因英軍常為地雷所阻、羅美爾上將希望與阿尼姆上將之部隊、取得聯絡、法國分裂派軍隊、由克勒克將軍統率、自卡特湖出發、向海岸推進、日前距海岸約五十公里、</p>
<h3>法俘歸國</h3>

<h3>頓河下游　蘇德仍在激戰　高加索蘇壓力增加　德軍作有計劃撤退</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日海通社電　蘇軍在東綫之壓力、又復加增、但德國守軍業已獲得援軍、因此德軍陣綫益形鞏固、德軍司令部以「予敵人以打擊為最良之防守戰」為口號、故常於搫退敵軍之猛攻後、立即發動反攻、使敵軍之計畫無法實現、蘇軍在伏朗尼慈西南之進攻、尤為猛烈、頓河下游之激戰仍在進行中、數日前渡過該河之敵軍已被殲滅、但蘇軍尚未放棄渡河之企圖、德軍在頓河與梅契間之反攻、續獲戰果、德軍裝甲車隊側面進襲、使蘇軍被迫自他處撤退、以補被德軍突破之陣綫、德軍在梅契之活動影響於蘇軍在頓河南岸之計畫至巨、同時蘇軍抵達庫班與羅斯托夫間之鐵道綫之企圖未獲得逞、敵軍在高加索之壓力自一月二十五日起較前增加、德軍作有計劃之撤退、故其損失甚微、斯達林格勒區被圍之德軍、仍作堅强之抵抗、其作戰精神迄無動搖、蘇軍前曾要求斯達林格勒區之德軍第六軍停止抵抗、但為德軍所拒絕、蘇軍在斯達林格勒之戰事中損失軍隊數軍與坦克無算之訊、業已證實、現蘇軍自他處抽調大軍、參加斯達林格勒之戰事、由此證明斯達林格勒之德國守軍仍有堅强之抵抗力、</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電　綜合此間所接消息、頓河下游戰况現已益趨激烈、德方亦暗示形勢重大、曾謂蘇軍之壓力益增大、據蘇方表示、德軍正到處試行頑强抵抗中、並謂德軍以戰車及步兵部隊實行猛烈反攻云、可見羅斯托夫之攻防戰現正激烈展開中、又蘇方面當期於二月二十三日紅軍紀念日前奪回羅斯托夫、故自西南北三方拼力猛攻、斯丹林於二十五日曾激勱蘇軍將士謂、應不顧犧牲繼續前進、同時蘇軍對德軍主要陣地反復展開突破作戰、德軍則陸續以新銳部隊向前綫增援努力防禦、並且使東方頓河唐納資河羅斯托夫之蘇軍向河岸方面　退、現德蘇兩軍正展開激戰、又德軍機械化部隊、於頓河馬尼赤運河中間側面之攻擊、極獲成功、現蘇軍已陷入苦　狀態、正自其他地區抽調援軍、德軍於馬尼赤河南方、出動有力部隊、遮斷羅斯托夫南方鐵道為目標、阻止蘇軍前進、現正壯烈激戰中、又自二十一日起至二十五日止、蘇軍於庫班河及馬尼赤方面、共喪失戰車六百九十九輛、砲一百九十九門、迫搫砲三百二十一門、車輛一百五十二輛、故德軍反搫之激烈、已不難於此想像、</p>
<p>柏林二十七日海軍通社電　負責方面今日稱、德國國旗、仍飄揚於斯達林格勒蘇聯秘密警察署房屋之上、於遠處均可望見、按蘇聯情報局及路透社昨日報告、理斯　村格勒已經陷落、足見其報告為不確、</p>

<h3>脆弱的美國民族性　同時必須認識日本民族精神　格魯演說　一月十五日朝日新聞</h3>
<p>去秋歸國之前任美國駐日大使格魯，為促起國民抗日意識挽救頽勢起見，經羅斯福授意，在各地發表演說、其最主要者厥為去年十二月七日專刋之「日本報告」，公佈渠個人之對日認識，其槪要為：去年十二月七日以來，極多疑問在吾人之腦海中盤旋，除有多數問題留待後世史家定評外，余有二大問題，知之極稔，用敢在此解答，或有人問（一）何以日本對英美開戰？（二）何以日本之領袖夢想戰勝英美？則對於第一問題之解答為：日人向不崇拜英美人之虛榮心，完全注重於現實，日人對於困難生活與戰爭，毫不介意。輕視英美之物質上享受，日本民風樸素，崇尚節儉，有不齒英美之黨派劣根性。以國家團結，國家至上為主旨。英美之民族性，但求一已舒適，滿足個人之慾望，不脫黨派之劣根性，故日本視為無氣魄而體格脆弱之國民。</p>
<p>日本為吾人之敵，（格魯自稱）余實無勇氣稱贊日本人之長處，但為美國本身利益計，姑舉左列數點以告國人：</p>
<p>（一）日本人信奉天皇之神聖，舉國一致擁護政府，歷年備戰，不遺餘力，無反叛搗亂份子。</p>
<p>（二）彼等自知武器遜於英美，但因全日本國民均服軍役，以此足可對抗英美。</p>
<p>（三）日本知足甘貧，尤屬難能可貴。雖物資不足，施行配給制度，但日本方面已認為豐足，國民節儉耐勞，遂成鞏固之軍備。</p>
<p>（四）彼等信賴指導戰爭之政府與國策，此種信念，一半由於建國以來之傳統，一半為歷來對外戰爭所養成。</p>
<p>（五）日本之全體主義，較德義之獨裁政治更早，德川幕府政治即為全體主義，全體主義者，即將政治，軍事，經濟集中歸獨裁者支配，日本即有此種形式。</p>
<p>對於第二項問題之解答：日本認為必能戰勝，緣日本曾勝淸朝及帝俄政府，然此項戰勝，乃因對方之內政崩潰，最近曾有某君對余謂：「協約國力量雄厚，希特勒必將屈服，然後日本亦將敗北。」此語未免過火，日本與德人不同，形勢上縱使戰敗，然心理上，經濟上相信其決不至崩潰，日本致勝之最大原因，即為全軍將士之士氣旺盛，多數人士認為日本因中國事變多年而無餘力，此實錯解，彼等尚有雄厚之資力，足以應付未來之大戰。（任：譯自一月十五日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>保富法　（七）</h3>
<p>— 聶雲臺</p>
<p>天道一陰一陽的平均，就是中道，又稱中和，中庸說：「致中和，大地，位焉，萬物育焉。」世間人事失去平和，即引起天道的變化，即如戰事及饑荒等等　刦數，都是由人事的不公平而起，人與人的爭，無論晢時勝負如何，結局是兩敗俱傷，暫時勝的亦終歸於敗。上文已說明贏棋的人，個個到底都大輸了。就可知天理終久是公平的。人心不平不和，究竟會被大理裁制。世間的人類，男與女的數目永遠是平均。有姓張的一母生十男，也有姓李的一母生十女。然而合起一國或全世界計數，男女的數目永遠是不會大相差的。這證明天道的公平。與陰陽的中和，有不可思議自然調整的能力。我們想要恃着我們的本領來違反天理中和的能力，畢竟是自己要吃苦的。如若天理陰陽沒有裁　調整的力量，那麽人的男女也不會永遠平均，世間一切事都會永久失去公平。强的巧的永遠富貴，善人永遠不會抬頭。</p>
<p>歐美人物質的眼光，　爲止有兵力和黃金能佔永久的優勝，無需講道德公理。對於他們力所能制服的人　，不怕大膽的表示驕倨侮辱。例如上海的公園，不許華人入內，還要公然寫在門口，「狗與華人不准入內，」及數種公共地方，如上海總會等處，華人不准在前門出入，不許乘電梯，均是故意表示侮辱，在安南的土人，亦是在一切公共機關不准在正門出入的，他們都是認自己的武力黃金可靠，決不會有一日需要你們弱懦的人民合作和援助的。就就叫作「驕滿。」「驕」就是「有所恃而無恐，我有勢力不怕你，擺架子，顯威風。」「滿」就是「有勢要使盡，有福要享足，專顧自己私利，不替他人設想，止管目前快意，不爲日後顧　。」這是由於缺乏高深的道義，飲食男女享樂自私，都是指導人向驕滿的路上發展，不曉得謙德的重要。</p>
<p>原來天道的標準，就是人事的公平，人心的中和，我們須要立在義務和謙和的方面，才能維持公平與中和。若先　在權利和驕　的方面，自然失去平和。就要受天理自然平準力的裁制。正好像慳貪巧很致富人家的子孫，一定是驕奢淫佚，糊塗　妄，自有一種方法敗壞他的家產，這也不過是天道自然制裁的表現，天道是極簡單的一件事，就是過分的要受制裁，吃虧的要受補益。</p>

<h3>最近之上海銀錢業（一）</h3>
<p>— 朱圭林</p>
<p>上海以交通之便利、附近物產之豐富、工商事業特爲發達、　以地處要　、扼江海之咽喉、不但爲中國經濟之核心、亦日爲遠東貿易之總滙、上海地勢之優　、　爲環竟所造成也、</p>
<p>上海市塲各種機　、雖不能謂有健全之組織、然以工商事業之發達、形成中國唯一的大金融市　、而成為津漢蘇杭等金融市塲之領袖、此乃無可否認之　實也、</p>
<p>上海之金融市塲、細分析之（一）中央儲備銀行、爲金融系統之中　機構、具有控制整個金融之能力、（二）商業銀行、為調劑　商業資金之盈虛、（三）錢莊、輔助商業銀行調劑小　商之資金、（四）其他如銀號·信託公司·企業公司·保險公司等、除中央儲備銀行爲特種金融　構外、在金融市塲最關重要者、爲一般商業銀行以及錢莊而已、茲詳述最近銀錢業狀况、俾使讀者明悉海金融市塲之槪况、</p>
<p>（一）戰後銀錢業之出路</p>
<p>一八一　中日戰事猝起、上海金融市塲、頓受鉅大波動、內地資金、隨戰事之蔓延羣向上海市塲逃避、是　銀行錢莊之存款、不論定期　期、莫不大量增加當此時也、銀錢業押借工廠之款、　戰事影響、竟成呆滯、差幸當局主持有方、辦理工商貸放、上海金融市塲、得以相安無事、惟銀錢業以存款之極度增多、旣須担負鉅量利息、又慮缺乏消化之處所、乃趨向投機之一途組織附庸之公司行號、劃撥資金、美其名曰放款、經營外滙·標金·公債·股票·紗花·布疋·以及日常用品等項、幕後莫不有人操縱之、因之上海金融市塲、暴漲暴落、一朝可成富家翁、但亦可於數小時　爲赤貧者、風險之大、可謂空前繼則擁有游資之　莊、因投機瞬息萬變、於是利用戰時物價必然上漲之定律、相率囤貨、竟至細微之物、亦爲其集中目標、物價商綫上漲、一般生活　度、頗不安定、甚至　廠購進原料、不必製造成品、經　若干時候、售出原料、即可大獲其利、於是投機橫行、達於極點、此種　險徼倖、實非銀錢業運用資金之正當途徑也、</p>
<h3>增產食糧之根本要着　日本農林省集會研究</h3>
<p>日本農林省當局，爲　勵增產食糧，特召集道府縣方面之負貢人，協商增加米麥及各種農產物之生產。討論要旨，認爲必須節约食糧消費。　最主要者，即爲增加國內之食糧生產·米·麥·大豆·雜糧·甘薯·馬鈴薯·菜蔬等，須規定一綜合增產計劃，即軍用之麻類，亦必同樣計劃，同時須改良肥料，除去害蟲，加强勞力。闡明以日本內地爲單位完成主要食糧之自供自給，克服一切資材，勞力，肥料之缺乏困難，全國動員，致力增產食糧。此項生產，決非以自身滿足爲目的，更非敷衍了事之空話。</p>
<p>獎勵生產，必須自收購，運輸，儲藏，配給，節約做起，方有宏効可收。如僅　提高生產能率，而任生產物偏處一方，自生自減，則當局之苦心，徒然成爲泡影。至於消費方面，最近頗多因業務上之額外配給，而致影響一般家庭之需要，此點極官　爲調度，更盼有以反省。</p>
<p>由此觀之，獎勵農　增產，實爲當務之急，必須採取各種生產物之綜合政策。　時在生產物未消費之前，尤須謹守一切循　經濟途徑，肅淸不合理之辦法，辦理此事，尤須具有熱誠，　生產必能收具全功。如各　糧政機關及統制命不　滴應國家之希求，與國民之　望，則生產前途，恐有困難。監督官廳，　此應深思熟慮。（雲·譯自一月十六日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>快樂和痛苦</h3>
<p>— 明月</p>
<p>撇開一切的條件，祗就快樂和痛苦來說，每個人當然貪圖快樂，避免痛苦。每個人的一生，還是快樂的時候多，還是痛苦的時候多？世界上的人，還是快樂的人多，還是痛苦的人多？</p>
<p>直到現在，對於這個問題，還沒有人做過精密的調查和統計。不過，就我們自己的經騐來說，每個人的一生，實在是快樂的時候少，痛苦的時候多！世界上的人，實在是快樂的人少，痛苦的人多！</p>
<p>就聖賢來說吧，有的「一飯三吐哺」，有的「夙興夜寐」，有的「如喪家之狗」，有的「憂讒畏譏」，有的「我不入地獄誰入地獄」，有的「先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂」。</p>
<p>再就文學作品來說吧，也是表示快樂的少，而表示痛苦的多。第一流的文學作品，大都表示人生的種種缺憾和不快意。大家傳誦的好詩詞，大都是「槪當以慷」「令人悽然泣下」的。所謂「歡愉之辭難工」，「窮苦之言易好」，就此說明人生是痛苦多，快樂少；所以窮苦之詞，容易打動人的心弦。</p>
<p>在快樂的時候，每覺時光過去太快；在痛苦的時候，却常覺時光過去太慢。在快樂的時候，常會「樂極生悲」；在痛苦的時候，却很難「破涕為笑」</p>
<p>哲學家叔本華在他的名著「悲觀論集」裏，便有獨特的發揮：</p>
<p>「……快樂常不及吾人所希望之樂，而痛苦乃遠過吾人所預計之苦。</p>
<p>「人皆謂世界上之快樂，假以重量銓衡，常超過其痛苦；原則無論如何，二者之間，亦能持平。此種說法，若讀者欲　察其合理與否，請試取兩相啖食之禽獸，其一恣搏噬於其他者，各就其所有之情感，比較觀之。</p>
<p>「在任何不幸或煩惱中，最善之安慰，即想及他人之境遇，有更不如吾身者；　安慰之方式，蓋為人人之所能而同具。然自整個人類言之，則此所，示之意義，其命運之　怖畏，為何如哉」</p>
<p>正惟人們是快樂少而痛苦多，所以聖賢豪傑和革命志士，情願犧牲自己的快樂，而為多數人解除痛苦！</p>
<h3>工作的態度</h3>
<p>— 謝淑</p>
<p>生活要不斷的表現，表現的手段就是工作。</p>
<p>一個理解人生的人，他必定愛好工作，並且生活也是充實愉快的。因為工作在某種塲合，然而，當我們勉力行　後，使我們有能力的自覺，成功後的慰藉是無上的。</p>
<p>工作是個人精神人格的具體化。無論是寫一篇文章，編結一件絨衫，或烹飪一道飯菜，其中都有「我」的智慧與技巧含孕在裏面，別人將會從你的工作的優劣中，知道你的為人。</p>
<p>因此，對於一件工作，與其敷衍，毋寗鄭重。世上沒有難的事，但也沒有容易的事。難與易是相對的。由瑣碎的事務以至艱巨的偉業，全視你所抱的態度而定，能付予心計與勞力的人，便會收穫到甜美的佳果。</p>

<p>— 華</p>
<p>——給我的女兒</p>
<p>魯迅的「朝華夕拾」上有一篇「二十四孝圖」說：</p>
<p>我幼小時候實未嘗蓄意忤逆，對於父母倒是極願孝順的。不過年幼無知，只用了私見來解釋「孝順」的做法，以為無非是「聽話」，「從命」，以及長大之後，給年老的父母好好的吃飯罷了。自從得這本孝子的敎科書（按·即二十四圖）以後，才知道並不然，而且還要難到幾十百倍。</p>
<p>自然也有不難的，如「陸績懷橘」，「子路負米」之類；但是也有非人力所能辦到而且還有性命之憂的，前者如「孟宗哭竹」，後者如王祥臥冰。而最使人不解，甚至於發生反感的是「老萊娛親」和「郭巨埋兒」兩件事。「郭巨埋兒」甚至於使他覺得祖母和他勢不兩立。他說：</p>
<p>我從此總怕聽到我的父母愁窮，怕看見我的白髪的祖母，總覺得她和我不兩立，至少也是一個和我的性命有些妨礙的人。後來這印象日見其淡了，但總有一些留遺，一直到他去世——這大槪是送給「二十四孝圖」的儒者所萬料不到的罷。</p>
<p>關於「郭巨埋兒」同治年間就有人以為是「忍心害理」。光緒時候　胡文炳並且以為「揆之天理人情，殊不可以訓」，在自己編刻二十四孝圖的時候，把它「割愛」了（見「朝華夕拾」後記）。足見並不是魯迅個人獨特的見解。</p>
<p>過這篇文章，我有點拉拉雜雜的感想，不過先聲明，我做兒子已經任滿了，現在正在做父親，也四十歲了，不算讀過多少書，比之於古人　五車子竹木板，總要金我得多，不算跑過多少地方，也國內十六省，國外四五國了。道不是自己賣廣告，不過想說明我大槪不算太年幼無知，見聞狹隘，但是恕我說老實話，我沒有看見一個人是孝子，我不，我的父母不是。我的女兒不是，我的隔壁三家，對門四戶的人們不是，我的親戚朋友門生老師不是，親戚朋友門生老師的親戚朋友門生老師以及隔壁三家對門四戶的人們都不是。大家平平常常，對父母有相當感情，如斯而已。至於專門講些繁文褥節，如所謂昏定晨省，冬溫夏淸之類，或作些奇奇怪怪的事情，如臥冰埋兒之類的，正和挖空心思來虐待父母的人一樣，連一個也沒有，講孝的故事或文章儘管多，也和「聊齋誌異」，「子不語」，「閱徴草堂筆記，「封神演義」，「西遊記」之類的書　管多一樣，是不能眞正證明有這種事實。因　二十四孝圖，或二百四十孝裏面的人物是不是都眞正那樣講過孝。我不免有點懷疑。</p>
<p>我覺得這懷疑不算完全沒有理由。大舜號泣於旻天，文王為世子，　年湮代遠，難以憑信。舜的故事是孟子和跟孟子同時的人說的，孔子時代就沒有。孔子時代的人不知道的事，孟子們忽然知道了，這就可疑，禹在舜之後，禹已經有人懷疑有無其人，　舜的有無自然更成問題。人的有無尚成問題，他的故事，而且是千多年以上的人說的，眞實性能够有多少呢？文王雖確有其人，他的故事也是後人傳述的。不盡可靠。</p>
<h3>無聊的人生</h3>
<p>— 堡景</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hiltno著　依今譯</p>
<p>（十一）</p>
<p>一個五月的早晨：學校的鐘聲在一個不習慣的時間響了起來，每一個人都被召喚到大堂裏。新校長拉爾斯頓（Ralston）威儀赫赫地，像煞有介事地，用冷靜而預示的嚴肅，使大家沈默了起來。「今天早上，我王愛德華七世陛下，已經升天了，你們聽見了這個消息，一定很悲痛。……今天下午不用上課，不過在四點半鐘，要在敎堂裏做禮拜。」</p>
<p>一個夏天的早上，在近着勃洛克菲爾德的鐵道綫上。鐵道工人在罷工，兵士在開着機關車，每部列車上都被擲石頭。勃洛克菲爾德的學生在巡視着鐵道綫，將全部事情當作極大的趣事。吉普斯負責監督着，立得稍遠些，在和一個草舍門口的人談着話。年輕的克里克雷德（Cricklade）走近了來。「對不起，先生，如果我們碰到罷工的人，我們怎麼辦？」</p>
<p>「你喜歡碰到一個麼？」</p>
<p>「我—我不知道，先生。」</p>
<p>上帝祝福這孩子—他談到他們簡直當他們是運動園裏出麥精的奇禽怪獣！「唔，你來得正好，那末—呃哼—你可以會會瓊斯先生—他是一個罷工的人。他工作的時候是在車站上管理信號箱的。你有許多時候，將你的生命交託在他的手裏。」</p>
<p>此後這事情就傳遍了全校：吉普斯對一個罷工的人談話。對一個罷工的人談話。他們在一塊兒談的時候，也許是很和好的。</p>
<p>吉普斯將這事想過許多遍，時常對自己說，加娣是會贊同他的，並且也會覺得高興的。</p>
<p>因此，不管有什麼事情發生，不管政治上發生了怎樣的千變萬化，他總忠於英國，忠於英國的同胞，也忠於勃洛克菲爾德，他以為這地方的最後價値，全看牠自己究竟能否尊嚴地，毫無慌張地，適合英國的環境。他得到了一種每年格外淸楚起來的預覺—預覺英國的太平盛世已經差不多過去了，預覺二個國家駛入了驚風駭浪之間，要是有一絲的錯誤，就將弄得不可收拾。他記起了金剛石祝典（Dimond　Jubiln）勃洛克菲爾德放了一個整天的假，他帶了加娣到倫敦去看遊行。那其年老的傳奋式的老太太）指在位六十年的維多利亞女王。—譯者）坐在她的御車裏，好像某種皺縮着的木偶，很動人地像徵着許多事物，像他自己一樣，都在趨向結束。這只是這個世紀的結束呢，還是一個時代的結束呢？（二十三）</p>
<h3>效法武訓的精神</h3>
<p>— 紀小裳</p>
<p>天下有不應為之事，而無不可為之事。所以俗語道：「精誠所至，金石為開」及「有志者，事竟成」，證之於義丐武訓，益為明顯。</p>
<p>我們且看武訓的傳略（摘自辭海上册）：</p>
<p>「武訓，淸山東堂邑人，鄕里呼為武七，家貧，幼喪父，行乞事母，稱孝丐；尋又喪其母。其後畫行乞，夜績麻，積貲漸厚，不取妻，不妄費，而樂濟貧乏。自恨不識字不讀書，因在邑之柳林集，購地建義學，延師課徒，禮意懇摯，師生有偷惰者，輒長跪以請，多為感奮…武訓德行的感人，實在不祇及於和他同時代同鄕里的人，數千百年之後，凡讀武訓傳者，誰能不有動於中，誰能不感奮萬狀呢？</p>
<p>我們常聽人家說，或者自己說：「這事恐怕不行吧！」「這事恐怕辦不成吧！」—實在，這都是自欺欺人的話。</p>
<p>做事之先，只須問：此事應做不應做，不用想：做得成或做不成。</p>
<p>我們應該效法武訓。</p>
<p>我們應該有『知其不可為而為之』的精神。</p>
<p>我們應該有『只問耕耘，不問收穫。』的態度！</p>

<h3>Congratulating the Establishment of the Shanghai Newspaper Federation</h3>
<p>In order to promote the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, the national policies of China and Japan, to study the development of the newspaper industry, to exert its capabilities, and to achieve the mission of the newspaper industry as a pioneer of the times, the Chinese and Japanese newspapers in this city jointly initiated the organization of the Shanghai Newspaper Federation, which was formally established yesterday. This is an autonomous organization of the Shanghai newspaper industry, a new era of unity in the Shanghai newspaper industry, and the first voice of autonomous unity in the newspaper industry in China and even between China and Japan. We take this opportunity to sincerely put forward the following wishes:</p>
<p>First, in the past, Shanghai was the cultural center of China and the most developed city in the national newspaper industry; however, in the past, each pursued its own policies and sought its own development. Although they have exerted their respective strengths for the country, society, culture, and education, it is regrettable that they did not cooperate with each other, and their strength was scattered, failing to form a force for transforming society and assisting national policies. Now that the Shanghai Newspaper Federation has been formally established, the Shanghai newspaper industry has its own organization, which can help each other, cooperate, concentrate its strength, and seek common development. For example, in terms of argumentation and enriching content, mutual assistance and division of labor can be achieved. In addition, issues such as saving paper, reducing advertising space, and unifying selling prices can be aligned with the actual situation during the war and work together to overcome difficulties. Therefore, the establishment of the Shanghai Newspaper Federation has epoch-making significance, whether in active or passive aspects. Here, we would first like to thank Mr. Osaka, the president of the Continental New Daily, for his greatest efforts in achieving this great success. We should also thank the foresight of the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the leaders of various newspapers for their support and cooperation under the major premise of overcoming difficulties together, so that the Shanghai newspaper industry can be united from now on. At the same time, each of us newspaper practitioners should further cooperate hand in hand from now on and work together to complete the mission of the newspaper industry in the new era.</p>
<p>Second, to be honest, China's newspaper industry is at least 20 years behind Japan. Now that the Shanghai newspaper industry has unprecedented unity, this is a major revolution in the Shanghai newspaper industry. We sincerely hope that all of our colleagues must take care of each other, encourage each other, and regard running a newspaper as a social undertaking, a cultural and educational undertaking, and an undertaking to assist the government in reforming politics, and jointly seek the progress of the country, society, and human culture. Everyone should have a fearless spirit, be the mouthpiece for the people, be a candid friend for the government, be a guide for the society, and be a pioneer for the times. Shanghai is the first city in China where the new national newspaper industry started, and it is also the city with the longest history and the most extensive development. Therefore, the Shanghai newspaper industry inevitably has self-esteem. However, excessive self-esteem has led to a small number of newspapers in Shanghai being complacent and unwilling to improve, hindering the progress of newspapers, and creating backward factors. This is truly one of the most serious phenomena in the Shanghai newspaper industry. Now that we have a common organization and a united force, we sincerely hope to change the attitude of complacency and arrogance in the past. Everyone must have a humble attitude of learning, and should also learn from the newspaper industries of advanced countries, especially Japan. Everyone should strengthen the spirit of self-criticism, correct mistakes, and learn from the strengths and advantages of others, and catch up. Only in this way can we avoid falling behind and be able to shoulder the mission of the newspaper industry in the new era.</p>
<p>Third, at present, Shanghai newspapers do not fully reflect the spirit of wartime, which is also undeniable. For example, during the war, Japanese newspapers did not have entertainment advertisements and low-level taste texts; nor did they publish colorful texts that were irrelevant to the country, the nation, and culture, luring readers to be passive and pleasure-seeking; they never became promoters of gambling halls, dance halls, and other consumer traps. If, in running a newspaper during the war, it fails to fully express the mood of the war and awaken the people, it really violates the mission of the newspaper industry in the new era. Our words of "Chunqiu blaming the virtuous" do not exclude ourselves. We hope that everyone will cooperate with each other under the common organization, work together hand in hand, and fully express the spirit of wartime news in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that wartime newspapers must support national policies and accept government control, which is no exception in any country. After having a common organization, we will naturally do our best to unite together and fulfill our responsibility to promote the government's good laws and national policies. At the same time, we hope that the authorities of both countries will fully support the newspaper industry. Because a country must have privately-owned newspapers with a sound foundation on the one hand, and the government should provide reasonable leadership on the other hand. Only when support is more important than leadership, and leadership is more important than control, and only when support, leadership, and control are properly planned and taken into consideration, can the effectiveness of wartime news be brought into play. For example, Asahi, Mainichi, and Yomiuri in Japan are the most perfect privately-owned newspapers, because the Japanese government before the war was able to provide full support, and the Japanese government after the war was able to provide reasonable control, so that today, newspapers can play a great mission of promoting national policies, guiding the people, and promoting wartime culture. If all newspapers become government mouthpieces, then only official announcements and orders are enough. Why do we need newspapers? It is precisely because the government must adopt public opinion and accept public opinion through newspapers in order to determine good and comprehensive policies. At the same time, only through newspapers can policies be explained and the people guided in order to expect the implementation of policies. Therefore, while congratulating and encouraging our colleagues in the newspaper industry, we also expect the authorities of both countries to give us continuous support and guidance.</p>

It is reported that Minister Lin came to Guangdong this time because all sectors of the province held a demonstration rally to support participation in the war and strike down Britain and the United States, and he was specially dispatched by the central government to come to Guangdong to attend the rally and deliver a speech.</p>
<h3>Beijing, Hankou and Other Places Handling Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Nantong, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Nantong Relief Committee started to distribute relief funds the day before yesterday. The relief personnel from various towns set off separately, checked the registered lists, and personally handed over the relief rice coupons and relief money to each household.</p>

<p>Hankou, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Hankou Winter Relief Relief Office, in order to implement the distribution of relief grain, had previously sent a letter to the Municipal Police and Social Affairs Bureau to send personnel to distribute rice coupons. The first batch of relief rice will be distributed by district starting on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Xinmin Society Contributes Funds for National Defense</h3>
<p>Beijing, 27th (Central News Agency) - At this temporary joint plenary session of the North China Xinmin Society, all attendees decided to donate all of the society's banquet expenses of 2,800 yuan (silver) as national defense funds in order to support the government's decisions and encourage the implementation of the New Citizen Movement.</p>
<h3>Su-Huai Security Team Has Been Compiled</h3>
<p>Xuzhou, 27th (Central News Agency) - After the establishment of the Su-Huai Security Command, the security teams of various counties have been reorganized and directly under the command of the headquarters.

The headquarters has recently appointed Deputy Commander Wang Zhiqing and Chief of Staff Zhu Meicun to depart to various counties on the 24th and 25th to inspect.</p>
<h3>Five US Submarines Sunk by Japanese Navy</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Stockholm from Stetinius News Agency, the U.S. Navy Department announced on the 25th that five U.S. submarines were sunk by the Japanese Navy in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>Japanese Defense Line in Burma is Strong; British Army Has Difficulty Making Progress; Terrain is Dangerous and Supply is Extremely Difficult</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 27th (Allied News Agency) - A British military observer in the British and American forces on the Indian-Burmese border recently returned from the front line and said that the British army has not been able to invade the strong defense line of the Japanese army in that area. Moreover, the Japanese army is fighting in that difficult area with elite soldiers, so there will be no new developments for a while. The British army's failure to advance towards Akyab is due to the dangerous terrain, which is easy to defend and difficult to attack, and the difficulty of supplying military supplies. Although the British air force is coordinating with the army, it is impossible to detect the results of the battle.</p>
<h3>Japan Promulgates New Order to Strengthen Air Force</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government announced in the official gazette on the 15th that it would revise a part of the "United Air Fleet Order" to form a United Air Force Command with two or more United Air Fleets, and implement it from February 2nd. In the past, two or more air fleets were formed into a United Air Fleet. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government felt the need to set up an agency to oversee this United Air Fleet. Therefore, the main purpose of this amendment is to actively strengthen the naval air combat power and to train a large number of drivers. The Naval United Air Force Command should be formed by two or more United Air Fleets, and a Commander of the Command should be established, directly under the command of the Emperor, and under the orders of the Minister of the Navy, and subject to the instructions of the Chief of the Naval General Staff, to handle matters concerning military administration and combat plans. The Commander of the Command has staff members, including the Chief of Staff, Adjutant, Chief Engineer, Chief Medical Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer. However, among the United Air Force Command, there is also the Training United Air Force Command. The Commander of this Command is directly under the Minister of the Navy. This Training United Air Force Command is generally formed by two or more United Air Fleets in the Japanese mainland. Therefore, those belonging to this United Air Fleet are called the Training United Air Fleet.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Officers Stationed in Europe Meet in Italy</h3>
<p>Rome, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - Japanese army officers stationed in Europe will hold a two-day meeting in Rome on January 29 to exchange views on the latest war situation and discuss how to deal with the development of the new war situation. The attendees are Japanese military officers stationed in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, France, Hungary, Turkey, and Romania, a total of ten people.</p>
<h3>Saigon Attacked</h3>
<p>Saigon, 27th (Central News Agency) - After an enemy plane came here for reconnaissance yesterday afternoon, seven more came to attack and bombed blindly. Japanese fighters took off to intercept and shot down two of them (only one has been confirmed). Ground artillery also shot down one enemy plane and severely damaged one enemy plane. This time, due to the enemy planes' blind bombing, the Indian street in the city was heavily damaged. It happened that yesterday was the anniversary of the Indian Declaration of Independence. In order to express sympathy for this, the Japanese army suspended the air raid on India on that day, but the enemy planes took the opportunity to attack when Saigon held the Indian Declaration of Independence Memorial Conference, causing many Indian casualties. The Indians are extremely angry at this despicable act, and their determination to destroy Britain and the United States and strive for independence has become even stronger. In addition, the people of Saigon have made great progress in air defense work under the leadership of the military. During the air raid, the fire brigade, ambulance team, etc. were very active. Wherever a fire broke out in the city, it was immediately extinguished, and the injured were rescued very quickly. The citizens have great confidence in the air defense of Saigon, so they are all very calm.</p>
<h3>Japanese Emperor Hosts Banquet to Bid Farewell to Former German Ambassador</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - The Emperor and Empress hosted a banquet yesterday to bid farewell to German Ambassador to Japan General Otto, attended by Prince Takamatsu and Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki, etc. The Emperor and Empress delivered speeches to Ambassador Otto, expressing their gratitude for his efforts in promoting relations between Japan and Germany during his tenure.</p>
<h3>French Government Abolishes National Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Vichy, 26th (Havas News Agency) - In order to reform local administrative institutions, the French government has abolished all 2,324 national municipal councils. The municipal council is the primary organ of local administration in France. Every village and town has a municipal council. More than 400 of them had been dissolved due to political relations. On January 15 last year, the French government issued an order to expand the powers of the governor, stipulating that the governor represents the central government in the province, exercises his powers, guides the mayors of counties and cities, and handles local administration. In addition, it is stipulated that a weekly report shall be published once a week, publishing various political resolutions of the government, with simple annotations attached, so that the mayors of counties and cities can know about it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Make a Large-Scale Attack on the Solomon Islands</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Allied News Agency) - According to news from Washington and Melbourne, the Japanese air force bombed enemy strongholds in the Solomon Islands and Port Moresby yesterday.

<h3>British and American Giants Hold Casablanca Conference; Chiefs of Staff of Both Countries and French Separatists Participate; Allied Cooperation is the Main Topic</h3>
<p>Tangier, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - After Roosevelt and Churchill held a meeting in Casablanca from January 14 to 24, they issued a communiqué, stating briefly that U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill held a meeting near Casablanca starting on January 14. The chiefs of staff of both Britain and the United States participated. U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall represented the United States. U.S. Fleet Commander Admiral King and U.S. Army Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Arnold also participated. The British representatives were Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Pound, Chief of the General Staff General Brooke, and Air Force Chief of Staff Sir Portal. Other personnel who participated in the meeting were U.S. Chief of Supply Major General Somervell, British Chief of Staff Mission to the U.S. Admiral Dill, British Chief of Combined Operations Major General Mountbatten, and British Deputy Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence Lieutenant General Ismay. Roosevelt and Churchill met with Roosevelt's representative in North Africa, Murphy, British representative in North Africa, Macmillan, Allied Commander in North Africa, Lieutenant General Eisenhower, Allied Naval Commander in North Africa, Admiral Cunningham, Allied Air Force Commander in North Africa, Major General Spaatz, Allied Deputy Commander in North Africa, Lieutenant General Clark, and directly met with British Commander in the Middle East General Alexander, Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff General Tedder, and U.S. Commander in the Middle East General Andrews. Roosevelt's entourage was Allied Supply Committee Chairman Hopkins, and Lend-Lease Act Commissioner Harriman. Churchill's entourage was Minister of Transportation Leathers. The staff members of both countries held meetings two or three times a day and reported to Roosevelt and Churchill at any time. The military situation of each battlefield was discussed, and various plans were also discussed to step up the operation. The meeting lasted for ten days, which was unprecedented for the Allies. The leaders and staff members of both countries have fully agreed on the operational plan for 1943. Stalin was invited to participate in the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. If he could participate, the meeting place could be changed to near Eastern Europe. However, Stalin is the commander-in-chief of the Soviet army, and the Eastern Front has launched an offensive and cannot leave the country. Roosevelt and Churchill fully understand the military burden of the Soviet Union. They will fight fiercely with the enemy in the most appropriate place to reduce the heavy burden of the Soviet army. All military proposals have been fully notified to Stalin. Roosevelt and Churchill also maintained contact with General Chiang Kai-shek and notified Chiang of the British and American measures to aid China. During the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, General Giraud was invited to meet with the Allied staff members. General Giraud and General de Gaulle have also met and had a long discussion. After Roosevelt, Churchill and their staff members completed the offensive plan for 1943, they returned to their respective countries to implement this plan.</p>
<p>Tangier, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - The place where Roosevelt and Churchill met was a lodge in the foothills outside Casablanca. The house was surrounded by palm trees, fences and barbed wire to isolate it from the outside world. After ten days of talks, they met with reporters in the small garden in front of the house. Four armchairs were placed in the garden. Soon, Roosevelt and Churchill entered the garden with Giraud and de Gaulle and sat down. When the two Generals shook hands, the reporter's camera started to move. Roosevelt said afterwards that this scene was a historic moment. Soon, de Gaulle and Giraud retired and carried out individual talks, and General Catroux also participated. When Roosevelt and Churchill delivered speeches, they frequently mentioned the close friendship between the two of them and expressed regret that the Soviet representative could not come to participate. In addition to expressing admiration for the Soviet Union's winter offensive, Churchill also praised the British and American actions to invade French North Africa. It is said that he has always been Roosevelt's partner. The ten-day meeting in Casablanca was an unconditional peace talk. According to the Allied communiqué, Roosevelt took time out to inspect the U.S. military in French Morocco on the weekend, and hosted a banquet for the King of Morocco.</p>
<p>The Roosevelt-Churchill Talks Have Ended; Washington Announced Four Decisions</p>
<p>Washington, Argentina, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the U.S. government recently announced the decisions of the Casablanca meeting. The content is as follows: (1) The military and political leaders of Britain and the United States have set the maintenance of the initiative on each front as their goal, and their opinions on the operational plan for 1943 have converged. (2) Giraud and de Gaulle, due to the mediation of Roosevelt and Churchill, have had their first meeting, so that they can negotiate a unified method for the French army, navy, and air force to participate in the war against the Axis powers again. (3) It was decided to report the results of the talks to Stalin of the Soviet Union in detail. Because Churchill and Roosevelt wanted to meet with Stalin, they expressed their willingness to hold talks in a certain place in the East. However, the Soviet leadership could not leave their posts because they had to personally direct the Soviet offensive. Roosevelt and Churchill also continued to contact Chiang Kai-shek and informed Chiang Kai-shek of the measures decided to aid the resistance war in Chongqing. (4) Britain and the United States will provide the Soviet army and Chongqing with the maximum amount of material assistance. Roosevelt also inspected the U.S. military on the North African front. This was the first time since Lincoln that a president had actually visited the battlefield.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - New York News, Willkie said in a broadcast speech yesterday that he regretted that the governments of the Soviet Union and Chongqing did not have representatives to attend the Casablanca meeting. He also said that he felt disappointed that the Four-Nation Military Commission could not be established.</p>
<p>Rumor that Churchill Asked the United States to Transfer Military and Political Leaders in North Africa</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - According to information obtained by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Churchill requested when he was in Washington that General Eisenhower's military power in North Africa be transferred to General Alexander. Berlin believes that Churchill also requested that Peyrouton be recalled and appointed General Catroux, a member of the de Gaulle faction, as Governor of Algeria. However, it has not been announced whether Roosevelt has accepted Churchill's request. According to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is believed that Roosevelt will not completely follow Churchill's request. Churchill hopes that the U.S. military can participate in more practical battles under the command of a British commander. Berlin believes that Britain and the United States will set up a committee to counter German submarines, because Britain hopes that the United States will pay more attention to this important issue. Regarding the possibility that Britain and the United States will launch a new war, Berlin declined to comment on this, but Germany is paying close attention to this issue.</p>
<h3>Rommel's Army Delves Deep into Tunisian Territory; Plans to Make Contact with Arnim's Army</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The retreat operation of the German and Rommel armies seems to be progressing smoothly. It is rumored that their main force has arrived 75 kilometers inside Tunisia. According to the news received here, the main force of Montgomery's army decided to reach Souvia, 25 kilometers west of Tripoli, on the 26th. The rearguard of Rommel's army near the port of Sula to the west of that place had a small conflict with the vanguard of the British army that attempted to break into Tunisia. At the same time, the Axis army in central Tunisia has completely suppressed the French rebel army and secured the 80-kilometer front line from Pont du Fahs to Kairouan. It now seems to have a tendency to advance further. The anti-Axis army on that side is mainly composed of the French rebel army. After several days of fierce fighting, the French rebel army seems to have lost a part of its troops. In desperation, the anti-Axis army urgently mobilized a strong U.S. military force and mechanized troops to reinforce the Osertia Creek area on the 26th. However, the Axis army, based in Pont du Fahs, is a strong force composed of tanks and infantry. It is now advancing to Puralada Ro, Osertia, and the French rebel army's position in Siriana, southwest of Puralada. The anti-Axis army on that side is completely in a passive position, and the Axis army's position is very strong in any location.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - According to newspapers, General Rommel's troops have crossed the Mareth Line. The rearguard of the German-Italian Allied Forces is doing its best to stop the British army in the northwest corner of Tripoli. The Axis army apparently carries a large number of landmines, because the British army is often blocked by landmines. General Rommel hopes to make contact with General Arnim's troops. The French separatist army, commanded by General Leclerc, started from Lake Chad and advanced towards the coast. It was about 50 kilometers from the coast a few days ago.</p>
<h3>French Prisoners Return Home</h3>
<p>Vichy, 26th (Havas News Agency) - A batch of French prisoners of war in North Africa returned to France yesterday and were released. Because Fuehrer Hitler made a declaration a few days ago, saying that German troops do not regard French soldiers who are forced to fight by the U.S. military authorities in North Africa as prisoners of war. Even if they are captured, they should be repatriated to their original French nationality.</p>
<h3>Lower Don River: Fierce Fighting Continues Between Soviets and Germans; Soviet Pressure Increases in the Caucasus; German Army Makes Planned Retreat</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong Agency Telegram) – Soviet pressure on the Eastern Front has increased again. However, the German defenders have received reinforcements, thereby further consolidating the German lines. The German High Command, using the slogan "The best defense is to strike the enemy," frequently launches counter-offensives immediately after repelling enemy attacks, thwarting the enemy's plans. The Soviet offensive southwest of Voronezh is particularly fierce. Heavy fighting continues in the lower Don River region. The enemy forces that crossed the river several days ago have been annihilated, but the Soviets have not abandoned their attempts to cross. The German counter-offensive between the Don and Manych rivers continues to yield results. German armored units launched flanking attacks, forcing the Soviets to withdraw from other areas to reinforce the lines breached by the Germans. German activity in the Manych area has greatly affected Soviet plans on the southern bank of the Don. Meanwhile, the enemy's attempt to reach the railway line between Kuban and Rostov has been unsuccessful. Enemy pressure in the Caucasus has increased since January 25th. The German army is making a planned retreat, hence its losses are minimal. The German forces encircled in the Stalingrad area continue to put up a strong resistance; their morale remains unshaken. The Soviets previously demanded that the German Sixth Army in the Stalingrad area cease resistance, but this was rejected by the Germans. Reports that the Soviets have lost several armies and countless tanks in the Battle of Stalingrad have been confirmed. The Soviets are now drawing large forces from other areas to participate in the Battle of Stalingrad, proving that the German defenders in Stalingrad still possess strong resistance capabilities.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to消息 received here, the situation in the lower Don River has become increasingly intense. The German side also hinted at the severity of the situation, stating that Soviet pressure has greatly increased. According to the Soviet side, the Germans are putting up stubborn resistance everywhere, and are launching fierce counter-offensives with tanks and infantry units. This shows that the battle for Rostov is currently unfolding fiercely. Furthermore, the Soviet side aims to recapture Rostov by February 23rd, the anniversary of the Red Army, and is therefore launching fierce attacks from the west, north, and south. On the 25th, Stalin激励 Soviet soldiers, saying that they should continue to advance regardless of sacrifices. At the same time, the Soviets repeatedly launched breakthrough operations against the main German positions, while the Germans continuously reinforced the front lines with new units, striving to defend and force the Soviets in the eastern Don, Donets River, and Rostov to retreat towards the riverbank. Currently, fierce fighting is taking place between the German and Soviet forces. Additionally, the German mechanized units' flanking attack in the middle of the Don and Manych Canal has been extremely successful. Currently, the Soviets have fallen into a difficult situation and are drawing reinforcements from other areas. South of the Manych River, the Germans dispatched powerful units with the goal of cutting off the southern railway of Rostov and preventing the Soviet advance. Fierce fighting is currently underway. Furthermore, from the 21st to the 25th, the Soviets lost a total of 699 tanks, 199 artillery pieces, 321 mortars, and 152 vehicles in the Kuban River and Manych areas. Therefore, the intensity of the German counter-attacks can be easily imagined.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Navy Press Telegram) – Responsible sources stated today that the German flag is still flying above the building of the Soviet Secret Police Department in Stalingrad, and can be seen from afar. According to reports from the Soviet Information Bureau and Reuters yesterday, 理斯 village 格勒 has already fallen, indicating that their reports are inaccurate.</p>

The current Portuguese Ambassador to Spain will become the newly established Minister of Cooperation. However, this reorganization has not yet been officially confirmed, as it is still under discussion and faces many obstacles that must be overcome one by one.</p>
<h3>The Fragility of the American National Character; Simultaneously, We Must Recognize the Japanese National Spirit; Grew's Speech; January 15th Asahi Shimbun</h3>
<p>Grew, the former U.S. Ambassador to Japan who returned to his country last autumn, with the authorization of Roosevelt, delivered speeches in various places to promote national anti-Japanese awareness and reverse the declining situation. The most important of these was the "Japan Report" published as a special issue on December 7th of last year, which publicized his personal understanding of Japan. The general outline is as follows: Since December 7th of last year, many questions have swirled in our minds. Aside from the many questions left for future historians to assess, I have two major questions that I know very well, and I dare to answer them here. Some people may ask (1) Why did Japan declare war on Britain and the United States? (2) Why do Japanese leaders dream of defeating Britain and the United States? The answer to the first question is: The Japanese have never worshiped the vanity of the British and Americans, and completely focus on reality. The Japanese do not care about difficult lives and war, and despise the material enjoyment of the British and Americans. The Japanese folk customs are simple and advocate thrift, and they despise the factional vices of the British and Americans. They focus on national unity and the supremacy of the nation. The American national character only seeks personal comfort, satisfies personal desires, and does not break away from the vices of factions. Therefore, Japan regards them as nations without courage and with fragile physiques.</p>
<p>Japan is our enemy, (Grew himself said) and I really do not have the courage to praise the strengths of the Japanese. However, for the sake of the interests of the United States itself, I will list the following points to inform the nation:</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese believe in the divinity of the Emperor, and the entire country unanimously supports the government. They have spared no effort in preparing for war over the years, and there are no rebellious and disruptive elements.</p>
<p>(2) They know that their weapons are inferior to those of Britain and the United States, but because all Japanese citizens serve in the military, this is enough to resist Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>(3) The Japanese are content with poverty, which is especially commendable. Although there is a shortage of materials, a rationing system is implemented, but the Japanese side already considers it to be sufficient. National frugality and hard work have created a solid military.</p>
<p>(4) They trust the government and national policies that guide the war. This belief is partly due to the tradition since the founding of the country and partly due to past foreign wars.</p>
<p>(5) Japanese totalitarianism is earlier than the dictatorial politics of Germany and Italy. The Tokugawa shogunate was a form of totalitarianism. Totalitarianism is the concentration of politics, military affairs, and economy under the control of a dictator. Japan has this form.</p>
<p>Answer to the second question: Japan believes that it will definitely win because Japan has defeated the Qing Dynasty and the Imperial Russian government. However, this victory was due to the internal collapse of the other party. Recently, someone said to me: "The Allied powers are strong, and Hitler will definitely surrender, and then Japan will also be defeated." This is an overstatement. Japan is different from the Germans. Even if it is defeated in terms of form, it believes that it will never collapse psychologically or economically. The biggest reason for Japan's victory is the strong morale of all its officers and soldiers. Many people believe that Japan has no surplus power due to the Chinese Incident for many years. This is a misinterpretation. They still have ample resources to cope with future wars. (Transcribed from the January 15th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Peruvian Government Severs Ties with France</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Allied News Agency Telegram) – The Peruvian government announced last night that it has severed diplomatic relations with the French government. This action follows in the footsteps of other Latin American countries.</p>
<h3>Australian Government Strengthens Economic Organizations; Centralized Management of Armaments Industry</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Haitong Agency Telegram) – According to news from Sydney, the Australian government is concentrating its efforts to strengthen economic organizations. Economic advisor Professor Copeland described the main principles as follows: (1) Reduce the production of civilian goods; (2) Transfer labor to key industries; (3) Control consumption; (4) Control the movement of people and goods to improve transportation efficiency; (5) Prevent increases in the cost of living; (6) The government bears wartime risks. Australia will also mobilize manpower, forcibly conscripting women and drifters to participate in national defense work. The government and factories will increase working hours, and food consumption will also be restricted.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Haitong Agency Telegram) – Australian Minister for Munitions Makin declared in Canberra yesterday that the centralized management of the Australian munitions industry is now urgent. Only in this way can the Australian government utilize all its male and female manpower. The government will establish munitions factories in the Australian interior and move coastal factories inland to ensure safety.</p>
<h3>British Daily War Expenditure Reaches 14 Million</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a telegram from London, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood reported in the House of Commons on the 26th that British military expenditure has increased further due to the expanding battle lines. The current average daily war expenditure has reached a huge sum of 14 million pounds sterling.</p>
<h3>Brazil Obtains 200 American Aircraft</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 27th (Haitong Agency Telegram) – Newspapers in Rio de Janeiro believe that Brazilian Minister of Aviation Filho's acquisition of 200 American aircraft in Washington for Brazil's use is a great achievement. These aircraft will be used for training.</p>
<h3>Finnish Parliament Adjourns</h3>
<p>Helsinki, 27th (Haitong Agency Telegram) – The current session of the Finnish Parliament adjourned yesterday. In a message to Parliament, President Ryti stated that this session of Parliament opened during the war and closed during the war, which is unprecedented in Finnish history. Fortunately, the Finnish currency has been able to avoid devaluation, which is gratifying. Tax revenue is sufficient to cover half of the expenditure, which is satisfactory under the current circumstances. Last year, Germany accounted for 70% of Finland's international trade, followed by Denmark and then Sweden. The President expressed his gratitude to the members of Parliament for their diligence for the country.</p>

<h3>Price Inflation Shows No Sign of Stopping; Authorities Determined to Intensify Crackdown; Rationed Food Supplies Must Be Sufficient; Economic Police Will Exercise Authority; Fourth Phase of Sugar Sales Increased to Twelve Catties</h3>
<p>After the authorities plan to improve the distribution methods of the main food grains in the two concessions, they will also impose strict control over other foods. Vegetable market prices will be determined according to restrictions, and price limits will also be implemented for all local goods, vegetables, biscuits, and candies on the market. Furthermore, the authorities recently prohibited manufacturers and wholesalers from increasing the prices of the goods they sell, and ordered them to submit the prices for review. In the future, there will be no reason for the retail prices of all goods in this port to increase. The authorities have now dispatched personnel to investigate the goods on the market and strictly crack down on stores that violate price limits. After the Lunar New Year, the prices of all goods in this port, except for a portion that will remain as they are, will be reviewed by the authorities and lowered. If anyone dares to deliberately violate the regulations, the economic police will be responsible for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Procuring National Rice</p>
<p>Since the two concessions prohibited the private sale and transport of main food grains, the price of rice in this port should be calculated purely based on the household rice price. The increase in other prices will lose its basis. However, the current rations received each period are not enough for ten days of food, which is somewhat uneasy. Due to the emergence of the above phenomenon, the authorities have actively sought ways to make up for the shortcomings. It is reported that officials have purchased a large quantity of national rice and other main food grains from other ports and have negotiated transportation methods so that they can be continuously transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Sugar Sales Methods</p>
<p>The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, in consideration of the New Year needs of legitimate food households, has decided to advance the sale of the fourth phase of sugar. For the Public Concession and Hongkou, Huxi, and Zhabei, sugar will be sold upon presentation of autumn property tax receipts. For the French Concession, sugar will be sold upon presentation of property tax receipts for September and October. The amount of sugar will also be increased, with each property tax receipt entitling the purchase of twelve catties of sugar weighed on a balance scale. Regarding the pilot program of sugar rationing by population in the Nanshi area, originally scheduled to be implemented on February 1st, the All-Cooperative Office has recently stated to our reporter that the sugar distribution by population in Nanshi will inevitably be delayed until after the Lunar New Year because the household registers of each district's Baojia have not yet been completely submitted. The quantity and price to be distributed will be announced by the Cooperative Office at that time. After the pilot program is effective, it will be implemented throughout the city. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fourth Phase of Sugar Sales Methods</p>
<p>Fourth Phase of Sugar Sales Method Based on Property Tax Receipts (1) For stores designated to collect property tax receipts on odd days and sell sugar on even days, the fourth phase of sugar will begin collecting property tax receipts on January 29th and selling sugar on February 2nd. There will be a spring break from February 3rd to 8th, and property tax receipts will continue to be collected on February 9th, and sugar will be sold on the 12th. This process will continue in sequence. (2) For stores designated to collect property tax receipts on even days and sell sugar on odd days, the fourth phase of sugar will begin collecting property tax receipts on January 30th and selling sugar on February 3rd. There will be a spring break from February 4th to 9th, and property tax receipts will continue to be collected on February 10th, and sugar will be sold on the 13th. This process will continue in sequence. (3) Food households who have not purchased the third phase of sugar may not purchase it in the fourth phase.</p>
<p>Increasing the Amount of Sugar; Weighing on the Spot</p>
<p>(4) For the fourth phase of sugar, the Public Concession and Hongkou, Huxi, and Zhabei will still use autumn property tax receipts, and the French Concession will still use September and October property tax receipts. Each property tax receipt entitles the purchase of twenty catties of sugar weighed on a balance scale on the spot. If the purchaser has dependent households, the sugar should still be distributed according to the households and not taken for personal gain. Food households purchase according to the stipulated price, plus a 2% retail tax. (5) Retailers will still follow the procedure of submitting property tax receipts for verification and receiving them back, as well as selling sugar. They must check and prepare everything in advance, bundled in bundles of ten, and indicate this on the sealed bag each time, verifying it on the spot with the staff in charge to avoid errors. (6) The above methods do not apply to the Nanshi district, where sugar rationing by population is about to be implemented.</p>
<p>Announcing Official Retail Prices</p>
<p>The Cooperative Office announced yesterday the official retail prices for the fourth phase, listed below: (1) Coarse Sand: 7.8 jiao in military scrip, 4.33 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (2) HX: 7.75 jiao in military scrip, 4.31 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (3) HM: 7.575 jiao in military scrip, 4.31 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (4) Snow White: 7.775 jiao in military scrip, 4.32 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (5) Dutch Red: 7.3 jiao in military scrip, 4.06 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (6) Winter Fog Blue: 6.675 jiao in military scrip, 3.71 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (7) TK: 8.2 jiao in military scrip, 4.56 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (8) Raw Sand: 7.3 jiao in military scrip, 4.06 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (9) Ice Flower Blue: 7.3 jiao in military scrip, 4.06 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (10) Local Ice: 9.25 jiao in military scrip, 5.14 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes; (11) Ice Shavings: 7.45 jiao in military scrip, 4.70 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. All of the above are based on a standard sixteen-liang balance scale.</p>
<p>Applying for February Sugar</p>
<p>The Cooperative Office has already completed the rationing of January's allocated Type A, distributor, and Type B end-user sugar. (1) Each retailer has distributed sugar according to the prescribed methods to maintain the needs of food households. (2) User-specific rations are only for personal use and must never be resold at inflated prices privately. Violators will have their rationing rights permanently revoked and will be prosecuted. As for February's sugar, early applications have been approved. The Cooperative Office has recently stipulated that the following categories are limited: (1) Coarse Sand; (2) Snow White; (3) Red Sand; (4) Winter Mist Green; (5) Local Factory Ice; (6) HM; (7) TK. Once the application is completed, it will be submitted to the military distribution authorities for approval of the total distribution amount, and then the distribution will be made according to the approved total amount. The date must be after the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3>Contributing Resources to Aid Education Based on Justice; Establishing a Social Foundation; Cultivating Good Children and Fostering a Positive Atmosphere; Improving the Environment and Seeking Public Happiness; Over 20,000 Yuan Received in Aid Yesterday</h3>
<p>The fourth Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund for Middle School Students Examination, completely ended yesterday amidst piercing northerly winds and heavy snowfall. Recalling the other day when elementary school students took the examination in drizzle, each student was able to brace themselves and strive for their studies in the face of wind, snow, and biting cold. This deeply moved the donors and the staff of the Scholarship Fund. It reminds us of Mencius's words, "Tax their sinews and bones, starve their bodies and skin," overcoming the environment with willpower, creating destiny, and engaging in deep thinking during times of suffering. This is precisely a good opportunity for all students to temper their minds and bodies, and a sign of a bright future. Though the wind and rain are dark, the rooster does not cease crowing. We wish that in their future lives, all students will be as honest and pure as white snow, which would be the best comfort to all the donating benefactors.</p>
<p>Yesterday, over 1,500 Students Took the Exam</p>
<p>Yesterday, from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM, the qualifying exams for all senior high school grades were held. From 1:30 PM to 5:00 PM, the exams for all junior high school grades were held. The number of examinees included 465 first-year junior high school students, 375 second-year students, 3 third-year students, 161 first-year senior high school students, 1 senior high school student, and 114 third-year students, totaling 1,577 people. The exams were held in fifteen classrooms. All students took the exam on time. Around 3:00 PM, heavy snow fell, and the examinees braved the snow to travel back and forth, fighting against the cold. Their spirit was vigorous, prompting colleagues to feel even more that the scholarship movement cannot be slackened in the future.</p>
<p>The Enthusiasm of the YMCA Staff is Admirable</p>
<p>The examination venue was still at the YMCA Middle School, with Mr. Ding Guangxun and Ms. Xu Hai of the YMCA in charge of various examination matters. YMCA members and school teachers Jiang Xiulin, Chen Anying, Gu Yifen, Rong Shujian, Wu Shouchong, Xu Meixiu, Cao Ying, [names missing in original text], volunteered to oversee the examinations. A banquet was held at the YMCA cafeteria to express gratitude. The gentlemen braved the wind and snow, traversed the roads, and, amidst great urgency, graded and reviewed the papers. Colleagues admire their enthusiasm for serving society, and hope that all applicants will never forget what they have received from these gentlemen, and repay society in the future, so that the hard work of these gentlemen will not be in vain.</p>
<p>Scholarship Funds Estimated at Over 300,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The number of applicants for this year's scholarship includes 1,577 junior and senior high school students, 859 elementary school students, 382 university students, and 94 vocational school students, totaling over 2,900 people. The tuition and miscellaneous fees for each junior and senior high school student can reach over 600 yuan at most, and at least 150 yuan. For elementary schools, the highest is 300 yuan, and the lowest is 40-50 yuan (a very small number). University tuition is generally 600 yuan, not including equipment and books. If we add and average the number of junior and senior high school students' tuition fees, each student would need an average of 100 yuan in assistance, which would require more than 150,000 yuan. If each elementary school student receives an average of 80 yuan, more than 70,000 yuan would be needed. If each university student receives an average of 200 yuan, 70-80,000 yuan would be needed. If vocational school students receive an average of 50 yuan, 5,000 yuan would be needed. According to this calculation, the average scholarship funding needed is over 300,000 yuan. Although the scholarship fund deposits received by this newspaper have been generously donated by various sectors, they are still less than two-thirds of the required amount. Therefore, we are deeply hesitant and earnestly hope that all sectors will continue to donate, so that fewer impoverished students will drop out of school today. In the future, when these students complete their studies and serve the community, they will be as delighted as if they had personally seen their children revitalize the family business. Furthermore, the number of one's own children is limited, while the number of children in society is unlimited. Those who have the ability should cultivate good children for society in addition to cultivating their own children. A good society means a good environment for one's own children. In this way, a good atmosphere is created. We await all sectors to generously donate at the moment of goodwill, planting a foundation. Moreover, appealing for education, if one can provide assistance within their capabilities, providing charcoal in the snow is more meaningful than any other charitable endeavor.</p>

This shows their eagerness for assistance. When those who donate see this scene, they will feel that this undertaking is not in vain. Colleagues will carefully select the recipients, so as not to disappoint the expectations of the benefactors.</p>
<p>People From All Walks of Life Are Public-Spirited, Generously Saving Money and Providing Assistance</p>
<p>This newspaper received letters yesterday: (1) Lu Zhu of Canghui wrote, "I have always been fond of epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting, regardless of the skill level. However, the number of requests from friends has increased daily. Therefore, I established a price list in the Guiyou year and made a vow in the Renwu year to use all the income to fund scholarships. Earlier this month, I participated in the Zhao Duo and fellow disciples' exhibition of epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting. The proceeds from the sales were also included. I heard that your newspaper's scholarship fund is in urgent need of funds, so I am sending 3,000 yuan in advance to meet the need. Enclosed is a check, please examine and receive it." (2) Mr. Gu Hongshen wrote, "School fees for all schools have increased, and the families of impoverished students are facing even greater difficulties, resulting in a crowded application process and insufficient funding. My child is currently in senior high school and, under these circumstances, with increased expenses, they are not eligible to apply and are unable to continue their studies on their own. Fortunately, thanks to the support of friends and the blessings of Heaven, the surplus from the company was distributed in advance. I received a bonus of 1,000 yuan under my name. I will use half of it to cover my child's senior high school graduation semester, and I am sending the remaining 500 yuan as a special contribution. I hope you will examine and receive it, just to express my personal feelings." (3) Daming Watch &amp; Optical Shop wrote, "Your newspaper's scholarship program benefits the poor and is commendable. To express our sympathy, we are contributing 500 yuan in new legal tender from the savings of our staff for assistance. We hope you will examine, receive, and allocate it on our behalf."</p>
<p>Commemorating Elder Chongde, Funerary Gifts are Used for Scholarships</p>
<p>(4) Shen Meiji, Rong Boyun, Master Mijia, and Master Xingci wrote, "At a time when the cost of living is rising daily, the general low-wage earners are experiencing great difficulties and living like years. How can they afford their children's tuition? However, your newspaper's scholarship amount is limited, so there are countless dropouts. However, we must first pay our highest respects to your newspaper's charitable actions and the generosity of all the great philanthropists. Recently, it was the fifth seventh-day memorial of the passing of Elder Chongde, Zeng Jifen, the mother of Nie Yuntai, the author of the Bao Fu Fa published in your newspaper. Yifu sent wreaths and elegiac scrolls. Because Mr. Nie cherished the virtues of his late mother and greatly encouraged students, he offered a gift of 50 yuan to commemorate the founding of the Chongde Elder Scholarship Fund. The Nie brothers are a prominent family in Hunan, with friends all over the world. Those who hear of this and are inspired will not be few." (5) Mr. Gong Yi of the South City Nine Mu Unusual Movement Office wrote, "Your newspaper's enthusiastic efforts for the scholarship fund have been sustained for a long time, which is admirable. In my youth, I was poor and lost the opportunity to study. Therefore, I have a deep sympathy for this public welfare. After the war, I joined the police force, earning a monthly salary of 67 yuan, which is not enough to cover even thin porridge. I have tried my best to save money and contribute 10 yuan. It is a drop in the bucket, and I know it is not enough, but I hope that this will be a call to action so that my colleagues will generously open their purses."</p>
<p>Huiwen and Lin Yin Schools Donate Free Enrollment</p>
<p>This newspaper received letters yesterday donating free enrollment slots: (1) Huiwen Middle School wrote, "Your newspaper's scholarship campaign benefits many students and is highly admirable. Our school was established on Nanyang Road, No. 183, last semester. Our colleagues are all former teachers of provincial schools. Seeing the large number of out-of-school youth, we cannot stand by without offering assistance. To support your organization's enthusiastic charitable actions, we have specifically designated ten free enrollment slots for new students (two for each grade in senior and junior high school, except for senior high school third grade). Please recommend students with excellent exam results from this selection to foster talent." (2) Lin Yin Elementary School wrote, "Our school has been established for over twenty years. The original location was on Linyin Road in the South City. After the war, it was moved to 585 Lane (A), No. 5, Malang Road in the French Concession. The school board decided this semester to offer ten free enrollment slots for each grade (grades 3, 4, 5, and 6). In addition to the students already enrolled in our school, four slots are still available for each grade. Students with passing certificates from your qualifying examination can come to our school for free admission (excluding book and miscellaneous fees)."</p>
<h3>Using Tree Bark as Raw Material; Establishing a Bark Textile Factory; Successful Trial of Mixing with Cotton Yarn for Spinning; Factory Established in Hangzhou, Official Production Next Month</h3>
<p>After the successful trial of mixing tree bark with cotton yarn for spinning, the first textile factory in Central China to use tree bark (such as mulberry bark and grass bark) to weave fabrics has recently been established in Hangzhou. Given the abundance and low price of such raw materials on the south bank of the Qiantang River, as well as the urgent need for cotton cloth among the people, the establishment of this factory is truly meaningful. The factory is named Asahi Bark Textile Factory, and the factory manager is Mr. Tsuda Shigejiro. It is located at No. 22 Xinba, Hangzhou. Preparations for starting production are already in place, and official production is expected to begin in early February.</p>

<p>A local dispatch from the Allied News Agency states that thousands of tons of rice transported from Bangkok arrived in Shanghai yesterday (Wednesday). Unloading can begin today, and it is reported that distribution will follow and be sold as public food. Ships regularly transporting rice have been suspended for some time in the past.

<h3>Applications to Lift Enemy Property Controls Will End as Scheduled; Japanese Authorities Hope All Owners Expedite Submission of Business Certificates</h3>
<p>Since the military took control of enemy property in the city, due to the relationship of property deeds in the two concessions, some properties were indeed owned by Chinese but registered under foreign merchants. In light of this, the Japanese authorities have organized applications to lift enemy property controls. Any real estate under management that is indeed owned by Chinese and can provide a business certificate can apply to lift the management. The application deadline is February 9, and there will be no further extensions. It is understood that the Japanese military authorities recently counted that five companies and associations, including Zhenxing and Hengchan, had submitted a total of 10,000 applications on behalf of applicants in the past three months. More than 5,000 cases have been officially announced to be lifted. However, only two-thirds of the applications can provide a business certificate. Therefore, the Japanese authorities still hope that owners can expedite the submission of outstanding business certificates within the deadline and apply to Zhenxing and the other five companies and associations to complete the procedures.</p>

<h3>After the First Snowfall, the Number of Frozen Corpses on the Road Increased Sharply</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, the city has been extremely cold, but snowfall has not yet been seen. According to custom, if there is no heavy snowfall in winter, the harvest for the coming year will be greatly affected. Therefore, farmers in the suburbs are very anxious. It was not until 4:15 PM yesterday (the 27th) that heavy snow finally fell, with silver flowers blooming everywhere, to the delight of thousands of people. However, the general disaster victims stranded on the streets, suffering from hunger and cold, died of freezing due to this sudden drop in temperature. The scene was very miserable and pitiful.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Press Association Held its Inaugural Ceremony Yesterday; Chinese and Japanese Officials Attended and Delivered Speeches, Creating an Unprecedented Scene</h3>
<p>The top leaders of Chinese and Japanese newspapers in the city and well-known figures in the press have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Press Association to promote the national policies of China and Japan, study the development of news, and enhance the performance of the press to fulfill the mission of being a pioneer of the times. Preparations have been completed, and yesterday (the 27th) at 5:00 PM, the inaugural meeting was held on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel. Attending were Chinese and Japanese government officials, such as Secretary-General Zhao Yue, representing the mayor, Director Feng Jie of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, Colonel Isobe of the Fleet Reporting Department, Lieutenant Colonel Shoshino of the Army Reporting Department, and Akayoshi and Ootomo of the Japanese Embassy, as well as responsible persons from Chinese and Japanese newspapers, and guests, totaling more than 60 people. The ceremony was simple and solemn. At the beginning of the meeting, the most respectful salute was given to the national flags of China and Japan, followed by a opening speech by Mr. Xu Liqiu of the Zhonghua Daily. He said, "Newspapers are important in promoting the nation and have a great responsibility to society. Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War and the participation of the National Government, the mission of newspapers in promoting national policy, arousing the public, and striving for victory has become even greater, and the responsibilities have become heavier. How we, who are engaged in the press industry, can accomplish such a major mission and how we can shoulder such a major responsibility are what our comrades think about every day. At the same time, this is also an important reason for the establishment of this association. As early as nine years ago, Chairman Wang told us a sentence: 'Unity is strength.' We need strength to accomplish such a great mission and to shoulder such a great responsibility. Only by uniting can we have consistent steps, and only by having consistent steps can we exert the effectiveness of propaganda. Especially in the great era we are in, we are advancing on the same track as Japan. Only by doing our best and working together can we eliminate the need to compete with each other. We all hold the same concept, so we have voluntarily united to form this Shanghai Press Association, working together to promote the national policies of China and Japan, studying the development of the new press, and enhancing the performance of the press to fulfill the mission of the press as a pioneer of the times." Then, Owari, President of the Dalu Xinbao, reported on the preparations, stating that last year, a Saturday meeting was jointly held by responsible persons from the press to discuss plans to promote the press industry. This association was born from this meeting. Subsequently, Chinese and Japanese officials delivered speeches in succession. Then, Investigator Dajia, Secretary-General Zhao, and Director Feng, as well as Mr. Chen Binhe, President of the Shen Bao, and Mr. Jin Xiongbo, President of the Ping Bao, gave speeches. They elaborated in detail on the responsibility of the press to unite and jointly shoulder the duty of defending East Asia and revitalizing China.</p>
<p>Then, the association's charter was adopted, and the list of directors was elected as follows (the order is based on the number of strokes of the first letter of each newspaper): (Dalu Xinbao) Standing Director Owari Yoichi, Director Ochiai Minoru, Members Kojima Hiroshi, Kazuko Katsuo, Taniguchi Tadashi; (Zhonghua Daily) Standing Director Xu Liqiu, Director Yan Jiabao, Members Lei Zhenyuan, Chu Baoheng, Shen Changyin; (Shen Bao) Standing Director Chen Binhe, Director Ma Yinliang, Members Lu Yiming, Guo Zongxian, Niu Xuncheng; (Ping Bao) Standing Director Jin Xiongbo, Director Lu Guangjie, Members Chen Yanyun, Chen Ke, Shao Yunpiao; (Guomin Xinwen) Standing Director Zhu Yongkang, Director Xue Zhiying, Members Zong Jingze, Xu Shihua, Ge Diefu; (Xin Zhongguo Bao) Standing Director Yuan [missing character], Director Lu Feng, Members Weng Yongqing, Wu Liugong, Wang Ping; (Xin Shen Bao) Standing Director Akamatsu Naoaki, Director Hidaka Seima, Members Moriyama Takashi, Sakato Katsumi, Ren Yunpeng; (Xinwen Bao) Standing Director Wu Yunzhai, Director Cheng Zhongquan, Members Chen Riping, Zheng Hongyan, Gu Zibo. Finally, it was resolved to issue a declaration of establishment, send a respectful telegram to Chairman Wang of the National Government, and pay tribute to Prime Minister Tojo of friendly Japan. The original texts are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration of Establishment of the Press Association In the past century, the people of East Asia have suffered deeply from the invasion of British and American imperialism. Everything from politics, economy, culture, and religion has been infiltrated with poison and greatly ravaged. Looking back on the past suffering, the feeling of common hatred for the enemy has increased. Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the United Kingdom and the United States have repeatedly suffered defeats and the entire system has collapsed. The world in East Asia has been completely renewed. The final victory is about to be completed. The two great nations of China and Japan, facing this great era, are hiding and encouraging advancement with bravery. Since the National Government announced its participation in the war, the two great nations have stood on the same front, with the spirit of sharing life and death, to fight to reduce the enemy. Culture acts as a pioneer of the times, and the press is also one wing of the battle line. Our colleagues are keenly aware of the arduous mission of the times and the importance of our own responsibilities. We establish this association based on the principles of sincere unity, courage, and diligence to work for the promotion of national policy and the arousal of the public. We hope to do our best to be loyal to East Asia, to complete the victory of the Great East Asia War, and to create the glory of the Great East Asia history. On the occasion of the establishment, we dare to express our sincerity and announce it to all sectors. We hereby declare.</p>
<p>Respectful Telegram to the Chairman of the National Government To Chairman Wang Jingwei of the "National Government": Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the front has achieved great results, and the rear has also established an unwavering spirit on the basis of sharing joys and sorrows to face this difficult situation. Recently, the National Government announced its participation in the war. The two great nations of China and Japan stand on the same front, sharing life and death to complete the victory of the Great East Asia War. The comrades of the Chinese and Japanese press in Shanghai are deeply aware of the importance of their responsibilities and the arduousness of their mission under this epoch-making progress. We vow to promote and expound on the established national policies of the two countries, arouse the public, and fulfill the mission of the press as a pioneer of the times. Furthermore, we are determined to unite spiritually and seek the consolidation and development of the fourth front in Shanghai. Your Excellency has struggled for China and for East Asia for many years, working tirelessly and achieving great achievements. We deeply admire your great achievements. On the occasion of the establishment of this association, the resolution of all members is to send a respectful telegram to you. We respectfully ask for your attention. Shanghai Press Association respectfully bows,</p>
<p>Telegram to Prime Minister Tojo of Friendly Japan</p>
<p>"To Prime Minister Tojo": Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, Your Excellency has silently used your profound strategy, set a special example, exerted your divine martial prowess, and annihilated the fierce and stubborn enemies. Wherever the army goes, it wins every battle. We deeply admire your great achievements. In order to unite the comrades of the Chinese and Japanese press in Shanghai, to work together with the spirit of sharing life and death, to jointly shoulder the mission of the times, to work hard to promote national policies, and to act as pioneers in arousing the public, we hereby respectfully send a telegram with unanimous decision on the occasion of the establishment of this association. We respectfully ask for your attention. Shanghai Press Association respectfully bows.</p>
<h3>Amid Intensified Preparations, Citizens Must Carry Citizen Certificates When Going Out; Special Alert Exercise Held for One Week; Strict Inspection of Pedestrians at All Intersections</h3>
<p>In view of the upcoming Lunar New Year and the year-end settlement period for money shops and various industries and stores in the city, the police authorities of the two concessions believe that the number of small-time crooks will increase opportunistically. Therefore, local security is a major concern. Therefore, as usual, preparations are being intensified. All police stations under their jurisdiction are ordered to increase posts and defenses at intersections and deploy additional detectives to patrol remote streets and alleys. Those with suspicious behavior must be questioned and their citizen certificates or identity residence permits must be inspected to effectively maintain local security. Therefore, citizens must carry citizen certificates with them when going out. It is also understood that the authorities will hold a special alert exercise during the Lunar New Year period, from January 30 for one week. Specially assigned police squads will patrol the streets. Strict martial law will be enforced at the edges of the South City, the French Concession, and the Public Concession. Pedestrians passing through barbed wire will have to go through inspection procedures. At the same time, self-defense corps members will continue to be on duty as usual during the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3>Self-Defense Corps Members Must Show Notification Slips and City Certificates When Taking Over Posts; Thieves Impersonating Self-Defense Corps Attempt to Deceive People of Property</h3>
<p>Recently, small-time crooks have been using various cunning schemes, often impersonating self-defense corps members to take over posts in order to deceive people of overcoats, flashlights, and other items before escaping. Such cases have occurred one after another in the urban area and the Public Concession. The Baojia authorities are very angry. In addition to reporting to the police for investigation, they have also ordered all self-defense corps members under their jurisdiction to show notification slips and citizen certificates (residence permits) for identification when taking over posts. If such incidents occur again, the corps member who leaves the post will be fully responsible for compensation.</p>
<h3>Preserving Wealth (7)</h3>
<p>— Nie Yuntai</p>
<p>The equilibrium of yin and yang in the Dao of Heaven is the Middle Way, also called harmony, as the Doctrine of the Mean says: "Attain to harmony, and Heaven and Earth will be in their proper places, and all things will be nourished." When human affairs lose harmony, it triggers changes in the Dao of Heaven. Calamities such as wars and famines all arise from unfairness in human affairs. Human conflict, regardless of temporary victory or defeat, ultimately results in mutual harm; even temporary victors eventually fall. The previous article already explained how those who win at chess ultimately suffer great losses. This shows that Heavenly principles are ultimately fair. When people's hearts are uneven and disharmonious, they will eventually be subjected to the judgment of the great Dao. The number of men and women in the world is always balanced. Some families named Zhang may have ten sons from one mother, while others named Li may have ten daughters. However, when counting the numbers in a country or the whole world, the number of men and women is never significantly different. This proves the fairness of the Dao of Heaven, and its capacity for natural adjustment through yin and yang, which is beyond imagination. If we want to rely on our abilities to violate the Dao of Heaven's capacity for balance, we will ultimately suffer. If the Dao of Heaven's yin and yang did not have the power to judge and adjust, then the number of men and women would not always be balanced, and everything in the world would permanently lose fairness. The strong and cunning would be forever rich and noble, and virtuous people would never rise.</p>
<p>Westerners see material things as the ultimate goal, believing that military force and gold can secure permanent victory, without the need for morality or justice. They boldly display arrogance and insult towards those they can subdue with their power. For example, in Shanghai's parks, Chinese people are not allowed to enter, and it is publicly written at the entrance: "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed." In several public places, such as the Shanghai Club, Chinese people are not allowed to enter or exit through the front door, nor are they allowed to use the elevators. These are deliberate displays of insult. In Annam, the local people are also not allowed to enter or exit through the front doors of all public institutions. They believe their military force and gold are reliable, and that they will never need cooperation or assistance from you, the weak and cowardly people. This is called "arrogant complacency." "Arrogance" means "relying on something and having no fear, flaunting power and putting on airs, displaying might and prestige." "Complacency" means "using all available power, enjoying all available blessings, focusing solely on personal gain, not considering others, caring only for immediate pleasure, and not planning for the future." This stems from a lack of profound morality. The indulgence in food, sex, and selfish pleasures all lead people down the path of arrogant complacency, without understanding the importance of humility.</p>
<p>Originally, the standard of the Dao of Heaven is fairness in human affairs and harmony in people's hearts. We must stand on the side of duty and humility in order to maintain fairness and harmony. If we start on the side of rights and arrogance, we will naturally lose balance and be subjected to the natural leveling force of Heavenly principles. It is just like the descendants of families who become wealthy through stinginess and cunning are sure to be arrogant, extravagant, licentious, and foolish, and will naturally find ways to ruin their family fortune. This is nothing more than a manifestation of the natural judgment of the Dao of Heaven. The Dao of Heaven is a very simple thing: excess will be punished, and those who suffer will be compensated.</p>
<h3>New Restrictions on Movement of Cotton Yarn and Cloth: More Than One Bale of Cotton Yarn or 40 Bolts of Cloth; Exemptions from Restrictions by Japanese Embassy Require Municipal Council Permit or Confiscation</h3>
<p>A public notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council’s Information Office states: Announcement No. 6242 has already been issued, stipulating regulations regarding the movement of cotton yarn and cloth. This type of yarn and cloth is currently not subject to restrictions imposed by the Japanese Embassy.</p>
<p>Handling Piecewise Removal of Items</p>
<p>The notice clarifies that although certain types of cloth, in quantities of 400 pounds or more of cotton yarn, or 40 bolts or more of cotton cloth, are currently exempt from requiring a permit from the Japanese Embassy for movement, such yarn and cloth now require a movement permit from this Council. Any such items moved within the Settlement without a permit will be confiscated. Applications for permits should be made at Office No. 624, in this Council’s building at 209 Jiangxi Road. The notice stipulates that anyone moving quantities of one bale (400 pounds) or more of cotton yarn, or 40 bolts or more of cotton cloth, must obtain a permit. This measure is designed to prevent unscrupulous merchants from breaking down larger quantities of yarn and cloth into smaller pieces for clandestine removal.</p>
<p>Consignees Must Verify</p>
<p>Anyone who has already obtained a movement permit from the Japanese Embassy is not required to apply for a permit from this Council. However, anyone who moves the quantities of yarn and cloth described above without a permit issued by either the Japanese Embassy or this Council will have the goods confiscated. Furthermore, any godown company or person holding yarn and cloth must verify that the person taking delivery holds a valid permit before releasing the goods, in order to demonstrate due diligence. Otherwise, they will be penalized. All relevant parties are urged to pay attention to the above measures.</p>
<h3>High Court and Special District Court to Return to Original Locations</h3>
<p>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Shanghai First Special District Court, after the war, were still located... The Criminal Division of the First Special District Court has already moved back to its original location on North Zhejiang Road for court sessions. Now, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has instructed both courts to abolish their temporary offices and move back to their original locations on North Zhejiang Road to reduce expenses and benefit public service. The presidents of both courts, Xu Weizhen, after receiving the order, immediately made repairs to the original location and decided to first abolish the temporary office of the First Special District Court yesterday, moving all operations back to the original location. All civil and criminal litigation matters will be heard at the original location on North Zhejiang Road starting yesterday, and a public announcement has been made to this effect. The Second Branch of the High Court has not yet moved back because the building repairs are not yet completed, but it is expected that it can be fully moved back before February 10th.</p>
<h3>New Price Limits for Warehousing</h3>
<p>The godown and warehouse industry in this city is very developed. However, the pricing for storage fees has never been uniform. A reporter from the Commercial News recently learned that yesterday (26th) at noon, the city's warehouse industry held a meeting to decide on unified price limits for storage fees and resolved to invalidate all existing contracts dated before February 10th and re-sign contracts according to the new prices. As for the handling fees, due to the current high prices and difficult living conditions for workers,</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market witnessed soaring prices across the board, driven by concerted action from both new and seasoned investors. Sellers were hesitant to sell. Department store stocks especially skyrocketed, with Wing On Company becoming a target for wealthy investors. Amidst the impending announcement of generous dividend payouts, one investor alone snapped up 14,050 shares. The price surged from 145 yuan to beyond 150 yuan.

<h3>Government Bonds Gradually Retreat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market saw its third consecutive day of gains. Momentum seems to have waned, and the strength of buyers appears to be diminishing, leading to a sharp decline.

Class C (first issue) initially traded at 7.50 yuan, rising to 9 yuan before sellers emerged, pushing the price back down to 8 yuan, then to 7.56 yuan. It finally closed at 7.90-8 yuan.

<h3>Recent Developments in Shanghai's Banking and Money Exchange Industries (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Guilin</p>
<p>Shanghai's convenient transportation, abundant resources, and thriving industry and commerce, combined with its strategic location as a vital hub and gateway to the sea, make it not only the economic heart of China but also increasingly the center of Far Eastern trade. Shanghai's geographical advantage is a product of its environment.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai's various market mechanisms may not be considered fully developed, its thriving industry and commerce have made it China's only major financial market, leading financial markets in Tianjin, Hankou, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Shanghai's financial market can be broken down into the following: (1) The Central Reserve Bank, the central institution of the financial system, with the power to control the entire financial landscape; (2) commercial banks, which regulate the balance of commercial capital; (3) native banks (qian zhuang), which assist commercial banks in regulating capital for small merchants; and (4) other institutions such as private banks (yinhao), trust companies, enterprise companies, and insurance companies. Aside from the Central Reserve Bank, which is a specialized financial institution, the most crucial players in the financial market are commercial banks and native banks. The following is a detailed description of the recent state of the banking and money exchange industries, to provide readers with a clear understanding of the overall situation in Shanghai's financial market.</p>
<p>(1) The Future of the Banking and Money Exchange Industries After the War</p>
<p>With the sudden outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Shanghai's financial market experienced major turbulence. Capital from the interior fled to Shanghai as the war spread. As a result, deposits in banks and native banks, both term and demand, increased dramatically. At the same time, loans from banks and native banks to factories became stagnant due to the impact of the war. Fortunately, the authorities managed the situation effectively by providing industrial and commercial loans, allowing Shanghai's financial market to remain relatively stable. However, with the extreme increase in deposits, banks and native banks had to shoulder a large amount of interest payments and were concerned about a lack of outlets for capital, so they turned to speculation. They formed subsidiary companies and firms, allocated funds, and called it lending, engaging in foreign exchange, margin trading, government bonds, stocks, yarn, cloth, and daily necessities. Behind the scenes, there were always people manipulating the market. As a result, Shanghai's financial market experienced extreme booms and busts. One could become wealthy overnight, but also be reduced to poverty in a matter of hours. The risk was unprecedented. The native banks with surplus funds then took advantage of the wartime law that prices were bound to rise and began hoarding goods, even focusing on the smallest items. Commodity prices rose sharply, and general living standards became unstable. Even factories found it more profitable to sell raw materials than to manufacture finished products. As a result, speculation reached its peak. This kind of risky gamble is not a proper way for banking and money exchange industries to use their funds.</p>
<h3>Fundamental Measures to Increase Food Production: Research by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry</h3>
<p>In order to encourage increased food production, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry convened officials from prefectures to discuss increasing the production of rice, wheat, and various other agricultural products. The key points of the discussion were the need to conserve food consumption. The most important point was to increase domestic food production. Rice, wheat, soybeans, miscellaneous grains, sweet potatoes, potatoes, vegetables, etc., should be included in a comprehensive production plan, including military hemp. Simultaneously, fertilizers must be improved, pests eliminated, and labor strengthened. The goal is to achieve self-sufficiency in essential foods within Japan, overcoming all difficulties in materials, labor, and fertilizer, and mobilizing the entire nation to increase food production. This production is not solely for self-sufficiency, nor is it merely empty talk.</p>
<p>Incentives for production must start with purchasing, transportation, storage, distribution, and conservation, to be effective. Simply improving production efficiency while allowing the product to be unevenly distributed and self-consumed would render the efforts of the authorities meaningless. Regarding consumption, recent allocations for business needs have affected the needs of ordinary families, which requires careful management and reflection.</p>
<p>Therefore, encouraging farmers to increase production is a pressing priority, requiring comprehensive policies for various agricultural products. Before products are consumed, adherence to economical practices and the elimination of unreasonable methods are necessary. The process requires enthusiasm to ensure the success of production. If food agencies and control orders fail to meet the needs of the nation and the expectations of the people, the future of production may be difficult. Supervisory authorities should carefully consider this. (Translated from the January 16th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Unified Currency and Military Scrip Return to Parity</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate set by the Money Exchange Association remained at 1.7%, unchanged.</p>
<p>Japanese military scrip stopped declining and returned to parity. Interbank trading was at 5.5535 yuan, while smaller money exchange shops and private banks quoted 5.56 and 5.55 yuan for buying and selling, respectively. Central Reserve Bank notes rose to 3.92 yuan but soon declined, with final trades at 3.90 yuan for selling and 3.85 yuan for buying, which was on par with the previous day's price.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Market Stalls</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market stalled yesterday, with only slight variations from the previous day. "Four Gentlemen" gray cloth opened at 10.60 yuan, falling to a low of 10.45 yuan before rising to 10.75 yuan at noon, an increase of 0.05 yuan from the previous day's close. "Peach Blossom" woman's cloth traded at 456 yuan, and "Double Gold Ingot" original cloth traded at 280 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Grain Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the grain market was sluggish because there was a rumor that soybean cakes would also be subject to control, causing uncertainty among buyers and a sudden drop in buying interest. The market was quiet, and prices fell by 2-3 yuan. A truckload of "Fei" brand cake was priced at 100 yuan, and another truckload for delivery in ten days was priced at 103 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Association Market Not Reopened; Cigarettes Still Sold Off-Market</h3>
<p>The cigarette market was stable yesterday. The Cigarette Association market had briefly reopened, but after being discovered by the authorities, it was shut down again. Therefore, traders continued to trade off-market but did not dare to linger, resulting in very little trading. Prices remained relatively stable. "Great Britain" brand sold for 12,500 yuan, "Old Knife" brand for 10,400 yuan, "Pinhai" brand for 7,800 yuan, "Wuhua" brand for 6,850 yuan, "Little Fairy" brand for 8,100 yuan, Japanese "Gold Gun" brand for 2,980 yuan, "Gold Building" for 2,700 yuan, "Red Rose" for 2,650 yuan, "Quanlu" brand for 3,500 yuan, "Nianzhi" for 3,250 yuan, "Guide" brand for 2,850 yuan, "Golden Pyramid" for 6,500 yuan, "Beautiful" brand for 5,900 yuan, "Golden Rat" brand for 4,100 yuan, "White Gold Dragon" for 4,200 yuan, and "Golden Dragon" for 3,250 yuan, with little change.</p>

<h3>Happiness and Suffering</h3>
<p>— Mingyue</p>
<p>Leaving aside all conditions, just speaking of happiness and suffering, everyone naturally desires happiness and avoids suffering. Is there more happiness or more suffering in everyone's life? Are there more happy or more suffering people in the world?</p>
<p>Until now, no one has conducted a precise investigation and statistic on this issue. However, judging from our own experience, there is really less happiness and more suffering in everyone's life! There are really fewer happy people and more suffering people in the world!</p>
<p>Take the sages and wise men, some "spit out food three times while eating," some "rise early and sleep late," some are "like a homeless dog," some "worry about slander and fear criticism," some say "If I don't go to hell, who will?," some "worry about the world's troubles before the world does, and enjoy the world's happiness after the world does."</p>
<p>Furthermore, judging from literary works, there are fewer expressions of happiness and more expressions of suffering. First-class literary works mostly express the various defects and dissatisfaction of life. The good poems and lyrics that everyone spreads are mostly "stirring and impassioned" and "making people weep sadly." The so-called "words of joy are difficult to write well," and "words of hardship are easily appreciated," explains that there is more suffering and less happiness in life; therefore, words of hardship are easy to touch people's heartstrings.</p>
<p>In times of happiness, one always feels that time passes too quickly; in times of suffering, one often feels that time passes too slowly. In times of happiness, one often "rejoices to the point of sorrow"; in times of suffering, it is difficult to "turn tears into laughter."</p>
<p>The philosopher Schopenhauer, in his famous book "Essays and Aphorisms," has a unique exposition:</p>
<p>"...Happiness often falls short of the joy we hope for, while suffering far exceeds the pain we anticipate.</p>
<p>"People all say that the happiness in the world, if weighed, often exceeds its suffering; in principle, no matter what, the two can be balanced. If readers want to observe whether this statement is reasonable or not, please try to take two mutually devouring birds and beasts, one of which is wantonly preying on the other, and compare them according to their feelings.</p>
<p>"In any misfortune or trouble, the best comfort is to think of the circumstances of others, who are worse off than oneself; this method of comfort is something that everyone can do and has in common. However, in terms of the entire human race, what does this show about the fearfulness of its destiny?"</p>
<p>It is precisely because people have less happiness and more suffering that sages, heroes, and revolutionary idealists are willing to sacrifice their own happiness to relieve the suffering of the majority!</p>
<h3>The Attitude Towards Work</h3>
<p>— Xie Shu</p>
<p>Life needs to be constantly expressed, and the means of expression is work.</p>
<p>A person who understands life must love work, and life will also be fulfilling and joyful. Because work provides a certain environment, and yet, when we make an effort, it gives us a sense of our ability, and the consolation after success is supreme.</p>
<p>Work is the embodiment of an individual's spirit and personality. Whether it is writing an article, knitting a woolen sweater, or cooking a dish, there is "my" wisdom and skill contained within it, and others will know your character from the quality of your work.</p>
<p>Therefore, towards a piece of work, it is better to be earnest than to be perfunctory. There are no difficult things in the world, but there are also no easy things. Difficult and easy are relative. From trivial matters to arduous undertakings, it all depends on the attitude you hold. Those who can give their minds and labor will reap sweet fruits.</p>
<h3>Reading "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" (1)</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>——To my daughter</p>
<p>Lu Xun has an article called "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" in "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk," which says:</p>
<p>When I was young, I never intentionally defied my parents, and I was very willing to be filial to them. However, being young and ignorant, I only used my own opinions to interpret how to be "filial," thinking that it was nothing more than "listening" and "obeying," and, after growing up, feeding my elderly parents well. Ever since I got this textbook of filial sons (note: namely, the twenty-four pictures), I realized that it was not so, and it was dozens or hundreds of times more difficult.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are also things that are not difficult, such as "Lu Ji Carrying Oranges in His Bosom" and "Zilu Carrying Rice on His Back"; but there are also things that are beyond human ability and even have a life-threatening risk, such as "Meng Zong Crying at the Bamboo" and Wang Xiang Lying on Ice. And what is most incomprehensible, and even causes revulsion, are the two incidents of "Lao Lai Amusing His Parents" and "Guo Ju Burying His Son." "Guo Ju Burying His Son" even made him feel that his grandmother and he were irreconcilable. He said:</p>
<p>From then on, I was always afraid of hearing my parents worry about poverty, afraid of seeing my white-haired grandmother, and always felt that she and I were irreconcilable, or at least someone who was somewhat detrimental to my life. Later, this impression gradually faded, but there was always some residue left until his death - this was probably something that the Confucians who gave us "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" never expected.</p>
<p>Regarding "Guo Ju Burying His Son," during the Tongzhi period, some people thought it was "cruel and unreasonable." During the Guangxu period, Hu Wenbing even thought that "judged by the principles of heaven and human feelings, it is not appropriate to teach," and "reluctantly cut it off" when he compiled and engraved his own version of the twenty-four filial exemplars (see "Postscript to Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk"). This shows that it is not just a unique view of Lu Xun.</p>
<p>After reading this article, I have some rambling thoughts, but I must first state that I have already completed my term as a son, and now I am doing my duty as a father, and I am also forty years old. I have not read too many books, but compared to the ancient people who used five carts of bamboo tablets, I have at least used metal type more often. I have not traveled too many places, but I have been to sixteen provinces in China and four or five countries abroad. I am not advertising myself, but I want to explain that I am probably not too young and ignorant or have narrow knowledge. But excuse me for being honest, I have not seen a single person who is a filial son. I am not, my parents are not, my daughter is not, the people in the three houses next door and four houses across the street are not, my relatives, friends, students, and teachers are not, and the relatives, friends, students, and teachers of my relatives, friends, students, and teachers, as well as the people in the three houses next door and four houses across the street, are not. Everyone is ordinary, and has a reasonable amount of affection for their parents, that's all. As for specializing in some formalities, such as so-called evening inquiries and morning greetings, keeping warm in winter and cool in summer, or doing some strange things, such as lying on ice or burying a son, it is the same as racking one's brains to abuse one's parents. There is not even one. There are many stories or articles about filial piety, but they are the same as books like "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," "What the Master Would Not Discuss," "Notes from the Thatched Cottage of Close Observation," "Investiture of the Gods," and "Journey to the West"—no matter how many there are, they cannot truly prove that such facts exist. I cannot help but be a little skeptical about whether the characters in "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" or the "Two Hundred and Forty Filial Exemplars" truly spoke of filial piety in that way.</p>
<p>I think this suspicion is not entirely without reason. The Great Shun weeping to the heavens, King Wen as the Crown Prince—years have passed, making it difficult to trust. The story of Shun was told by Mencius and his contemporaries, and not during Confucius' time. The people of Confucius' time did not know about it, but Mencius and his contemporaries suddenly knew about it, which is suspicious. Yu was after Shun, and some people already suspected whether Yu existed, so Shun's existence naturally becomes even more of a problem. If a person's existence is still a problem, how much authenticity can there be in his story, especially when it is told by people more than a thousand years later? Although King Wen certainly existed, his story was also passed down by later generations, and it is not entirely reliable.</p>
<h3>A Meaningless Life</h3>
<p>— Bao Jing</p>
<h3>Model Teacher of All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hiltno, translated into modern Chinese</p>
<p>(11)</p>
<p>One May morning: The school bell rang at an unaccustomed time, and everyone was summoned to the hall. The new headmaster, Ralston, stood majestic and imposing, using a calm and foreboding solemnity to silence everyone. "This morning, His Majesty King Edward VII has ascended to heaven. You must all be very saddened by this news... There will be no classes this afternoon, but at half-past four, there will be a service in the chapel."</p>
<p>One summer morning, near the Brookfield railway line. Railway workers were on strike, and soldiers were driving the locomotives. Stones were being thrown at every train. The students of Brookfield were patrolling the railway line, treating the whole thing as a great amusement. Chips was in charge of supervision, standing a little further away, talking to a man at the entrance of a thatched cottage. Young Cricklade approached. "Excuse me, sir, what do we do if we encounter strikers?"</p>
<p>"Would you like to encounter one?"</p>
<p>"I—I don't know, sir."</p>
<p>God bless the child—he talked about them as if they were strange beasts emerging from the wheat fields of the sports ground! "Well, you've come at just the right time, then—ahem—you can meet Mr. Jones—he's a striker. When he's working, he manages the signal box at the station. You've entrusted your life to him many times."</p>
<p>After this, the story spread throughout the school: Chips was talking to a striker. Talking to a striker. Perhaps they were very friendly while they were talking.</p>
<p>Chips thought about this many times, often telling himself that Kathy would approve of him and would be pleased.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter what happened, no matter how the political landscape changed, he always remained loyal to England, loyal to his English compatriots, and also loyal to Brookfield, believing that the ultimate value of this place depended entirely on whether it could adapt to the English environment with dignity and without panic. He had a premonition that grew clearer every year—a premonition that England's golden age was almost over, a premonition that the two countries were sailing into stormy seas, and that the slightest mistake would lead to irreparable consequences. He remembered the Diamond Jubilee, when Brookfield had a whole day off, and he had taken Kathy to London to watch the parade. The old woman in the carriage (referring to Queen Victoria, who reigned for sixty years—Translator) sat in her carriage, like some kind of shrunken puppet, poignantly symbolizing many things that, like himself, were coming to an end. Was this just the end of the century, or the end of an era? (23)</p>
<h3>Emulate the Spirit of Wu Xun</h3>
<p>— Ji Xiaoshang</p>
<p>There are things in the world that should not be done, but nothing that cannot be done. Therefore, as the saying goes, "Where sincerity prevails, even metal and stone can be opened," and "Where there's a will, there's a way," which is further evident in the case of the righteous beggar Wu Xun.</p>
<p>Let us look at Wu Xun's biography (excerpted from Cihai, Volume 1):</p>
<p>"Wu Xun, a native of Tangyi, Shandong Province, was known in his village as Wu Qi. His family was poor, and he lost his father at a young age. He begged to support his mother and was known as a filial beggar; later, he also lost his mother. After that, he begged while spinning hemp at night, gradually accumulating wealth. He did not take a wife, did not spend extravagantly, and enjoyed helping the poor. He regretted not being literate and not having studied, so he purchased land in Liulinji in the county to build a free school, hired teachers to teach students, and was sincere and earnest in his etiquette. If teachers or students were lazy, he would kneel for a long time to plead with them, often inspiring them... The inspiring nature of Wu Xun's virtue is not limited to those who lived in the same era and village as him. Centuries later, anyone who reads Wu Xun's biography cannot help but be moved and inspired!"</p>
<p>We often hear people say, or say ourselves, "This matter is probably not feasible!" "This matter is probably not going to succeed!"—In fact, these are all self-deceiving words.</p>
<p>Before doing anything, you only need to ask: Should this matter be done or not? You don't need to think: Will it succeed or not?</p>
<p>We should emulate Wu Xun.</p>
<p>We should have the spirit of "knowing it cannot be done and yet doing it."</p>
<p>We should have the attitude of "only asking about the plowing, not asking about the harvest!"</p>

<h3>Mr. Bu Ming Donates One Thousand Yuan to Help Ten Orphanages</h3>
<p>In Shanghai, children cry from hunger, a sight too unbearable to witness. Poverty and illness are too horrible to look at! With no home to return to, and no one to care for them, as soon as the north wind rises, corpses lie strewn about. [I, Bu Ming,] donate one thousand silver certificates to subsidize the funding. I respectfully request your newspaper to distribute the funds to ten orphanages for needy children. I know that a cup of water cannot put out a burning cart of firewood, and that this small amount cannot solve the problem, but I am only trying to do my best to fulfill my duty as a human being. (Editor's note: This newspaper will follow your kind instructions and distribute the funds accordingly. The list is as follows: (1) Fuyou Orphanage (2) Pin'er Orphanage (3) Gu'er Orphanage (4) Zaitong Education Center (5) Jingye Education Center (6) Bethel Orphanage (7) Emmanuel Orphanage (8) Bethany Children's Paradise (9) Youyou Education Center (10) Tushanwan Orphanage. We hope that the above institutions will bring official receipts to the business department of this office to collect the funds.)</p>
