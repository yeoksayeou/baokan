<h3>改進司法</h3>
<p>司法在政治體制中，居於超然地位，有其獨立神聖的使命。「有罪必檢舉，　判必公允」，是法制的極則。一個社會，這個社會必定有表裹一致的安　，人民隴益必定有充分的保障。一個國家當然也是如此。因此，從司法制度的嚴密與否，法治效能的克盡與否，可以　知一各國家社會的秩序如何？</p>
<p>我國對於現代司法制度之確立，歷時已久，即專門學校中學習法科的人才，又佔各學科中最大多數。就司法人才的尊量而言，可說人浮事。然而，就法治効能而言，距離美滿之境尙達。其尤不可　言的，司法機關，於政治機構中，客觀賞似乎成為冷衙鬥的現象，幾為一般人所遺忘，至少有並不重視的觀念。而國家致費中對於司法經費，亦不占重要也位。司法機關因陋就簡，有蕭條廖落之感，司法人員待遇但薄，抱得過且過之心理，少數狡點者且受物慾之誘，作非分之圖。在此情狀之下，超然獨立之法治精神，湮沒不彰，社會秩序，未能鞏固，雖不能課全責於司法機關，但其未能充分克盡法治的使命，自亦不無咎責。我們盼望司法界諸君奮起勇於負責，不斷求進的精神，以期法治效能之實現。</p>
<p>自從上海租界接受以後，司法職權歸於一元，對於上海市區域以內的司法行政，審判案件，論理應較租界時代，逐漸進步，趨於合力，爲租界接受以後，樹立新氣象的先聲，尤其在各友邦撤廢治外法權之後，特別在司法上改進，給予友邦善意的答復。</p>
<p>最近司法行政部當局對於司法行政，司法人事，積極整飭；對於貪贓受賄之徒，破除面情，扣押懲辦。我們對於司法當局重視法紀的精神，殊為欽仰。同時，我們要求鞏固整個司法制度，充分發揮法治效能，對於今後司法行政之策進，願略進一言，以為當局之參改：</p>
<p>第一，確定司法經費，在國家政費中，應與其他重要政治部門同樣列入預算。欲求加强司法制度，自應願到一切必要的費用，在原則上不可偏畸。</p>
<p>第二，經費確立以後，調整司法人員的待遇，為不可或緩之舉。行政官吏廉潔已難，而司法官吏康潔更難，因為司法官吏行使職權直接與當事人發生利害關係，也就是最易發生行賄傷廉之事。因此，對於司法官吏之俸給。無論如何，必須滿足共一身一家之生活。誠如司法界前輩張一鵬氏所言，今日低級法官之所入？不及黃包車夫；中級法官之所入，不及理髪匠；高級法官之所入，不及商店經理。以如此待遇，責以如此重任，必其克盡厥職，事實上確乎困難。我們當然非謂待遇低薄，即可圖非分之財。但可謂特遇　薄，是促成舞弊之一因，則無不可。</p>
<p>我們願先以上述兩事，為改進司法之先決條件。至於其他技術上的改迆，已不乏司法專家的獻議，於此暫不　論。</p>
<h3>承認印臨時政府汪主席發表談話　中印兩民族關係日臻親密</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電自由印度臨時政府已於上月廿一日成立，國民政府亦已申明爭認。主席並特發表談話如下：</p>
<p>印度獨立聯盟會會長江特拉鮑斯氏，巳於上月廿一日頭導印度民族，樹立臨時政府，期於打破英帝國主義之桎梏，達到多年來印度獨立自主之志願。吾人聞之，實在感佩與欣奮。印度民族，爲求獨立自主，今日以前，已經過不少次的努力和塲門，雖以英帝國主義的窮凶極惡，未能即底於成。然而印度民族並不以此自　，反抗運動，益見其蓬勃茲長。這種百折不回的精神，實足戰勝　難而克底於成。今者大東亞戰爭　發，盟邦日本以海陸軍之威力，使英帝國之野心暴行，受一大打擊。盟邦日本同事更以解放東亞，援助東亞民族完成獨立，薪致共榮爲號召。印度民族受此感召，獨立運動更達於高潮。鮑斯氏以豐高之智戰，鮑歷　離險阻之經驗，出而爲印度獨立運動之領導者，必能與盟邦日本，及東亞諸民族國家，同　協力，招形英帝國主義之東總，更進一步粉碎英美共詞　佔世界之企國，使印度獨立與東亞共榮，同時貫徹。中國與印度交通以來，會以文化融洽見重於歷史，今者更將以政治方針之一致，兩民族關係日臻親密，共同躍進於大明之前途，余　以此致其歡祝與欣慰之誠。</p>
<h3>致電鮑斯慶祝</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電印度臨時政府已宣吿成立，國府並於一日由褚外長致電印江特拉鮑斯主席。申明承認之意。國府汪主席特於二日電江特拉鮑斯慶賀，原電如下：「印度臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯閣下，欣悉閣下於本月二十一日，樹立臨時政府，為爭取獨立自主，領導民衆，堅決奮鬥，本主席甚表同情，深信印度三億民衆，　求自由之夙願，必能完成，燦爛光榮之日，即將來臨。特電慶賀，並祝貴主席政賜康泰，中華民國國民政府主席汪兆銘」</p>
<h3>日外相官舉行歡宴會</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電</p>
<p>日重光外相二日晚六時半在外相官邸舉行歡迎晚資會，招待江特拉鮑斯及印國民軍參謀長霍斯中校，不管部長薩哈伊，並有石井樞密顧間，天羽情報局總裁，日印協會長大　信常侯　，澤田駐緬大使等作陪，迄八時半責主　歡而散。</p>
<p>日外相致詞</p>
<p>席問重光外相致歡迎辭略謂：印度呻吟於英國壓迫之下為時已久，印度所受之痛苦，實為整個亞洲之痛苦，印度之悲哀，同時亦為亞洲之悲哀，今鮑斯氏爲爭取印度之自由出而鬥爭，實深銘感，自　格善　克　在東亞之勢方，已被完全驅出，印度之狀況已見改善，今日木軍隊已開抵印度之門前，亞洲業已　而毅然崛起，決定共自己之命述，吾人已為從盎格魯薩克遜中解放亞洲而從事門爭，本諸政治之平等與　濟之自由，覓致大東亞之和平與繁榮，因此印度獨立之願望，於日軍作戰成功後更趨高昂者，乃爲當然，當此時機，印度在鮑斯氏領導之下，樹立自由印度臨時政府者最得時宜，凡我亞洲人民，對此莫不深表　欣，日本政府之即承認印度臨時政府者，不外表明日本人民之熱意也。今吾人應團結一致，共同努力，以爭取最後勝利，解放亞洲。</p>
<p>鮑斯氏答詞鮑斯答辭日，溯自大東亞戰爭發生以來，吾人屢乘貴國之同情與援助，今又蒙貴國承認自由印度臨時政府，實深感荷，余深感我印人責任之重大，吾人應為爭取自由奪門，直至完全擊減敵人而後已。余確信吾人在貴國強有力之援助下，必能獲得解放，余對貴國政府及貴國國民所賜之同情與援助，未能有以報之，實深慚愧。余確信吾人必能立於戰場與敵軍作戰，且必能克服一切困難，忍受犧牲，以表明吾人之感謝，常吾人以熱血賞澈共同目的時，亞洲必採完成眞正之恒久之基礎，唯右以我亞洲國民之血熱，始可換取亞洲之光明。</p>
<h3>江特拉鮑斯　昨發表聲明</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　印度臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯，二日會見記者團，發表聲明書，表明感謝日本承認自由印度臨時政府。並謂。，全印國民軍「到德里去」之士氣，因此次臨時改府誕生必愈形昂　。茲誌扛氏聲明書要旨如次：余就任印度</p>
<p>獨立聯盟　純裁後，首先强化該聯盟並改編印度國民軍，本人對聯盟提示之要湖即總動員，並應印慶國民軍之期望，直接擔任指揮該軍，「到德里去」為我軍之標語，此於軍中已收獲莫大交過，今我軍莫不熟悉該標語，全員唯一之希望，即早日出發前綫工作，印度國民軍改編擴張後，獨立聯盟即行改組，被吾人已到達為開始獲得自由之最後奮鬥，須作潑後準備之階段。於此階段中，勢須樹立自由印度臨時政府，日本帝國政府承認我政府，已使敵方對於日本隊印憲國新作之宣傅票致命打擊。今吾人已獲得僑居東亞各地三百萬印人之熱誠信賴，彼等全面支特我軍，且吾人刻止與本國內之自由運動緊密連絡，故即敵方亦不能輕視</p>
<p>臨時政府　之重要性。自一八五七年之大抗爭以來，印度國民於自己政府領導下，執反英之武器崛起、，此尚屬初次。於國境外樹立臨時政府，非無歷史先例，自吾人立塲而言，固以在印度國內樹立臨時政府為佳，然於今日悄勢下，印人知名之指導者，多被監禁，本國內人民悉為英國解除武裝，嬌印度國內設立臨時政府事，於臨時政府領導下推行戰參決不可能，因此須由束亞各地印人負起此重大責任。臨時政府非僅為宣傳而已，臨時政府之任務，乃為獲得自由，作最後奮鬥，自印度逐出英美勢力，然後於印度確立和平與秩序，故為確立集印民意志於一體之永久自由印度國民政府之基礎已奠定，待此政府一經樹立，則現下之臨時政府即將立時消減。臨時玫府為</p>
<p>戰門組織，故內即僅有爲遂行爭取自由鬥爭所必要之代表，臨時政府於進軍本國領土之時，並決定設置普通政府中所有之各部，臨時政府之任務，乃為開始遂行為爭取自由之戰爭，故軍隊代表較內閣一般行政方面之代表權限為大。總之，由各方面言之，臨時政府係一實行戰們之機關，今已據有足以保隙印度民衆之軍隊及强力同盟國之支援，故將來一切成功時所需老，皆已獲得，今後唯開始最後之鬥爭，以獲取自由。反軸心各國皆標榜自由與民主主義以大西洋意車為口頭禪，然對彼等支配下之各國家竟加以彈壓，幷奪取伊朗及伊拉東等各國家之自由，而觀諸日本已先後允諾菲律賓及緬甸獨立，幷巳承認自由印度臨時政府矣，蓋印度佔有世界人口五分之一，故，</p>
<p>支持印度　之獨立遝動，誠含有偉大之意義及個個，余認為世界上何者為正義與道義而戰，乃權易判斷之事。</p>
<h3>林宣部長　對全國廣播　正義的和平與道義的同盟</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電　宣傅部林部長，於二日晚九時半至十時十五分，在中央廣播電合，「正義的和平與道義的同盟」為題，對全國廣播。首稱中日條約之修訂，已於十月卅日實現。大家看了新約全文，聽了主席訓話，對國家前途，對東亞大局，增加了無限勇氣。次解釋劑下的三個問題，即：　為什麼可以得到這樣合於正義的和平絛件？　右了合於正義的和平條件，重慶方面怎樣呢？潑後謂我們也要一樣的為着國家的安全發達，爲着東亞的共榮解放，節衣縮食，勤勞奉公。我們於此更要大聲疾呼，實踐中日盟約，實現正義的和平，鞏固道義的同盟，動員一切人力物力，實行決戰，打倒英美，興復中華，保衛東亞。</p>
<h3>岸部長　發表觀感</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電</p>
<p>日本駐華大使館情報部長岸偉一氏，前因公赴日，茲以任務完完舉，業已於日前返京，巾央社記老特往訪，承對記者所間各點，發表觀感如次：本人本欲在巾日締結同盟條約之前來京，後因天氣惡劣，飛機不克起航，乃於十月三是十日返抵上海，三是一日　京，未能參加中日盟約盛典，深以為憾。此次返國，為期頗短，僅在瞬內滯留十日。此行印象深者，即為國內一般靑年學生，充沛對建設大東亞之熱忱。現日本靑少年睹時勢重要，咸不願墊伏事校內，力主一致奮起，棄學從戒，為國效命，負起解放為亞民族之偉大使命，意旨殊為堅決。同時日本婦人，亦在後方生產界作右力之活動。現日本國內一般工作，除卻非四十五歲以下男子操作不可老外，大多由婦女代替且發土極大効能。無論大家閩秀，或平民婦女，均一致爲努力增產而團結。是故戰時日本之陣容，愈加堅强整日游閒者僅幼童而已。本人預計日本新增之一批生力軍，加以盟邦中國之協力，大東亞戰爭前途，定必極爲光明。</p>
<h3>中日同盟　特別廣播</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電今未中日同盟特別廣播第三日，宣傳部為使全國民衆了解中日兩國訂立同盟條約之意義，特邀請首都文化界新聞昇評論家等知名之士，於今三日下午十時廿分，在中央廣播電台舉行廣播座談會。各界粉電</p>

<h3>美煤礦工嚴重已入總罷工狀態　羅斯福前晚下令接受各礦</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城二日中央社電據紐約來電·美國東部煤礦礦工之臨時復工，迄三十一日夜半已告期滿，今事實上已成總罷工狀態，煤礦礦工公會所屬工人，已於三是一日夜半至一日上午之問，粉紛離開工作地，礦工公會當局雖尚未發出總罷工指令，但據各地煤礦之報告，一日內已有五十三萬礦工離開工作地，且傳有烟無烟等各主要煤礦地帶之公會分會，已對出礦之礦工發開始罷工之指令。根據合衆社一日上午之各地調查，本雲几尼亞及弗去尼亞兩州二十四萬礦工，已表明罷工之決意。又此次最先開始罷工之亞拉巴馬州二萬二千礦工，亦已聲明於新契約成立前，決不復工。此外，預料伊利諾斯南部之二萬三千，印第安納一萬二千，俄亥俄二萬五千，肯塔基三萬三千，弗去尼亞一萬八千，以及西部各州煤礦七萬五千礦工，均將參加罷工。他方礦工公會總會一日上午亦召集各地方分會代表約二百名，在華盛頓舉行政策委員會，該會至下午可告終了，其為決定指令總罷工抑要求罷工工人即時復工，現尚不明，惟徵諸現各地之罷工情勢，總會方面縱不認可罷工，總罷工恐亦難避免，故政府方面或將對此出以强壓態度。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二日中央社電　據華盛頓電，羅斯福一日晚下令接收煤礦，同時內長伊基斯亦簽署行政命令以兼，接受全部每日出煤在三十噸以上之煤礦，並任命各煤礦礦主為煤礦委托經營者。羅斯福在接收令巾指定罷工工人於三日午前復工，若工人拒不復工，則依據禁止罷江法嚴罰不貸。煤工工會當局對於總統此舉，並未表明意見，衆認煤工工會將於二日下午四時召開政策委員會，指令工人停止罷工。</p>
<h3>工潮蔓延至西部加拿大</h3>
<p>里斯本二日中央社電紐約訊：美國礦工風潮，現已蔓延至西部加拿大，在納特吐姆金姆關特，溫哥華，比林西登，英國哥林比亞等地之礦工一千四百各，因要求服日及增加工資而發生罷工。美礦工聯合會之政策委員會，昨天之會議中，未能決定右效行動，在礦主及工會之談判期問，政策委員今決定交由小組會曦決定，其報告今日可望發出。</p>
<h3>日本營昨發表新幾內亞島戰況　滇緬邊境準備下期作戰</h3>
<p>束京二日巾央社電日大本營二日三時三十分發表：　新幾內亞島戰况，芬希哈罕附近，我軍部隊以奮勇攻勢重創敵軍後，復整頓陣勢準備再戰。自十月十六迄二十九日止，經判明之主要戰果如次：敵棄屍三六四八具，南獲大砲六門，槍枝約六五零枝，特種子彈約一四〇〇〇發，毀敵大砲十門，子彈庫二處，食糧倉庫三處，我方陣亡四二二名。馬當南方地區，我軍部隊刻仍奮勇攻擊屢次增强之敵軍巾，九月下旬迄今，予敵損害已不下千名。　滇緬邊境方面戰事正順進展，該方面我軍部隊，已將怒江以西之渝軍退路完全切斷，隨處掃減殘敵，同時並準備下期之作戰。我軍自十月王旬迄二十七日止，所獲之主要戰果如次：敵棄屍一〇二〇具，俘虜一一〇名，鹵獲子彈約二三〇〇〇發。</p>
<h3>澳門通訊　駐渝美空軍　有名無實</h3>
<p>— 建屏</p>
<p>渝方軍民發生反感</p>
<p>美國駐淪空軍，以昆明為據點，以桂林重慶等爲中問基地，設置前進根據地，原冀空襲日木本土，切斷南方補給路。自七月底以來至本月初，反遭日機連續空襲，各基地皆受重創，尤以飛機，機材及空軍人員損失慘重，因此，斯蒂威爾等首腦部人員飛赴新德里，於東南亞反軸心軍司令部協議重編駐渝美空軍及補充人員器材等事宜。駐渝美空軍之連續敗戰，使重慶方面極為失望，因而對抗戰前途之絕望觀念，愈益深刻普遍。在渝方原期美空軍派遣幹部，供給飛機及其他資材，藉以重建渝空軍，但美國置此要求不願，派遺本國空軍至渝，合渝軍負担基地建設　地上動務，關於作戰，亦出以拒絕與渝軍事委員會連絡之態度，結果「喧賓奪主」，使渝方成為美空軍之部屬。</p>
<p>渝方尚鼓吹「美國助華作戰，凡我軍民應一律報之以義」等類標語，提供作戰上種種便宜，担任某地建設，通信，氣象觀測等地上動務，而各地軍民更連日設宴，疑待美國空軍，唯橫暴之美空軍對於作戰，絕對不與渝軍連絡，因而渝方殊感失望憤慨。此非獨美空軍之秘密主義使然，實係美空軍不信任渝軍而陷嬌獨善主義所致。是以美空軍迄未與渝軍共同作戰，且幾無援助其作戰之事，如七月底日機空聾重慶時，美空軍竟捨棄苦戰中之渝軍p34戰鬥機等，惶惶然而週。美軍此種獨善主義，殊使重慶軍民發生反感。目下雖在東南亞反軸心軍司令部協議駐渝美空軍之强化方策，然渝方對之不信任實已與日俱增了.（十月二十四日航寄）</p>

<h3>印督對饑荒圖武力解決</h3>
<p>廣州二日巾央社電據息，印度總督華維爾，為解決日趨激化之孟加拉省鐵饉間題，事實上已於該省實施軍政，企圖以武力解決。蓋華維爾於視察該省災情後，十月二十九日夜即於加爾各答召集關係者舉行救濟對策會議，研究對策，三十日返新穗里後，即任命維克里中將為孟加拉省省長，頃維克里已奉命赴任，督勵部屬以武力壓制政策，謀求問題之即速解決。華維爾採取此種緊急政策之原因，乃鑒於此問題之激化，實與英本國之政治問題有關，同時企圖以武力預防國民會議派利用此機會右所舉動。</p>

<p>柏林二日巾央社電據海通社訉：克里長卓與克里米亞之戰，仍須視為整個之戰爭，蘇軍於滬末藉　速之流動部隊雖有突入我陣綫者，然以敵軍向尼科波爾之推進而言，仍無重大發展，惟其向西及西南之推進，則漸有據大之勢，然而戰局之動向，現仍不能預測。蓋因突八聶伯河下游之敵流動部隊，與穗軍流動後備隊之戰爭，仍在進行中。克里米亞之門戶仍在德軍手中，隨時可以威　突入之蘇軍之側面。總之，諾蓋斯平原的戰事與聶伯河套才戰事，右密切之述帶關係，在後一戰區內，蘇軍再度進犯穗軍陣縱之右翼均被擊退，德軍向突入克里伏洛格以北及西北之蘇軍進攻，進展順利，敵雖堅强抵抗，然德軍先鋒，亦右土力軍之增援，激戰固方興未艾也。總之，東綫南路之戰事，雖已達最高峯，然尚未右決定性之結果，現雙方均集中全力於該處，故其他各處之戰況，已漸趨沉　。</p>
<h3>義境德軍實施　拖延消耗戰　完成目的據守新陣錢</h3>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　德軍當局以日發表，南義德軍已自伊索尼亞東方十一英里之　瓜羅奈撤退。部戰綫西翼之德軍，繼績塞行拖延消耗戰略，周末於誘敵通攻而予以重創後，及至敵方實力消耗殆盡，德軍始依照計劃，退至數公里后之新陣線。敵軍雖已進抵此項新陣綫一千，然對德軍戰略猶未能捉換，敵軍似在等待美軍中部主力進展之效果。該部美軍自伏爾托諾上游出發折向西進，有進攻蒂堤諾及克羅斯山模樣，美軍右異則有北進進攻維那弗洛及米萊多山之意，自伏爾托諾谷向維那弗洛前進之敵軍已被擊退。亞平靑山中部·文契亞托洛·伊索尼亞公路·及甘波巴素以西一帶，英第八軍左翼活動之處，局勢未右若何變更，至少敵軍壓力未有增加之勢。英第八軍右翼已漸迫近特里諾河之上游及中游，惟尚無渡河之勢，沿海英軍在該河北岸所建橋頭堡，慨在穗軍砲火威脅中，尚無擴展。</p>

<h3>土國具絕大決心　維護獨立自由　伊斯美總統重申政策</h3>
<p>安加拉二日中央社電土耳其總統伊斯美昨日在議會開幕禮中宣稱：土耳其於過去八年中所堅守之政策，乃塞於民族獨立及自由之原則。渠謂，「吾人之外交政策，自一九三五年危機後，迄今幷未右所改變。目前吾吾人之觀念，仍欲擁護根據民族獨立自由之原則，以保護文化之基礎，吾人之政治努力，傾向於反對企圖破壞此項文化者。為避免戰禍計，吾人曾毫不猶豫參加需要最大勇氣之行動，吾人現已目睹世界之危機，逐步向破壞路上　進，不僅文化之偉大工作頻遭摧毀，即文化本身亦被埋葬於瓦礫之中，此種爭權奪利之殘忍之混戰，已威脅各民族之生有，而此項混戰正日益加緊，幷推翻一切建於人道主義上之基　。吾人未來可取之途徑序。土耳其共雖尙末軍入戰禍，惟於以經四年中，已受有世界危機之反應，且亦會作多種　性與勉渡難關，維吾人爲全世界及爲全人類呼吸自由空氣起見，不惜忍受一切犧牲，吾人願此次戰爭中勝利者為文化與人道，亦惟有與維護人道與文化者之團結中，吾人方能見快樂與宇宙自由之曙光。」伊斯美總統務爲國防，如有機會即任務爲國防，如有機會即當隨時加以增強，議會當信任土耳其之軍隊，足以應付任何事變與工作，政府潑主要之工作，乃爲予軍隊以優良之訓練與酊備</p>
<p>措辭抽象含義深長柏斯丹埠二日中央電伏期美總統在國會中演說，說明土國外交政策，在維持自由與獨立之文明基礎，決排擊武力政治及戰爭被壞之器力。當此土國態度為列强所注意之際，士總統演說，已引起莫大反饗。渠在演詞中並未使用「巾立」一言，一巾立」一言尤為土京外交界所潑重視。土總統復又聲明土國排擊暴力政治及土國準備協力維持秩序，此亦為各國外交界所重視。衆認土總統使用此種愼重言辭，足可反映土圃處境之困難，其演說內容雖極抽象，但含義實甚深長</p>

<h3>食糖特種配給　辦法重行調整　經濟處核定者外全部停止配給</h3>
<p>中央社訊　本市自實施計口授糖以來，滬市華商存糖，早巳配給完　，糖商合作營業處，雖巳訂講大批食糖，本年度內食糖之供　，當可無　受乏，但常局為節約食糖之消耗起見，特將特種糖之配給重行調整，是項調整辦法，全市將採取同一步來，分別實施，茲將各情探　于後：</p>
<p>撙節食糖消耗重訂配給辦法</p>
<p>查食　為滬市五百萬市民主要食料之一。過去嚴重之食糖供應威脅，經市糧食局與有關各方協力實施計口授糖以來，此種嚴重局勢，遂告普　解除，惟滿來滬市　量存底有限，在戰時體制下　應動行節約，　節消耗，當局經濟處對第一八兩區內之特種會糖配給，在　歷正當需要之原則下，重行訂定配給辦法，　交糖商合作營業處切實遵照辦理外，並盼其他各區亦採取一致同樣步　，　以促進戰時體制之强化，支符政府撙而物力之本旨。</p>
<p>特種食糖配給月需百餘萬斤</p>
<p>糖商合作營業處，過去對於特種食糖每月配給之數量，計藥房為五萬四千市斤，旅館飯店咖啡館為十萬市斤。糖果製造廠為六十二萬市斤，公司行號銀行寺院學校以及政府機關為五萬六千市斤。酒店及其他店號為二十四萬市斤，洋商行號店舖及工廠等六萬六千市斤，以上共計每月實配食糖之數量，竟達一百十三萬六千市斤之鉅。</p>
<p>需用特種配給由經濟處審核</p>
<p>關於經濟處所訂定之重行調整特種食糖配給之暫行辦法，對于公司行號·銀行·寺院·學校·醫院·政府機關，及洋商行號，店舖工廠之特種食糖配給、今後全數停止配給，藥房與酒店等配給食糖，亦暫行停配，由各該商號除備具需用食糖申請書外，並將其出品用糖銷數總數等，用糖說明，月終存糖數量，詳密塡報糖商合作營業處，韓呈該處，經與衛生處共同詳密商討後，擇其必需者或可酌予减低者，經該處審定後，再行通知，至旅館與飯店及咖啡館等之配給，亦依照上述規定辦理，糖果製造廠之食糖供應，則由各該廠商塡明出品用糖銷貨各種數量，以及用糖說明，曁製成之糖果存貨，分別造具表册具報，亦經該經濟處審核決定後，再行配給其供應之數量。</p>
<p>食糖適當供應黑市當可消滅</p>
<p>經濟處之此種措施，不獨使正當商號，獲得適當之供應，而于食糖之消耗，得以普通撙節，同時黑市食糖，亦可得以消滅，蓋各商號之食糖，既獲得正常之供應，自無餘糖供給黑市之消納，第一八兩區刻巳遵照實施，其他各區內，亦將採取同一之步驟，以勵行節約。</p>

<h3>看了「飄」</h3>
<p>— 天笑</p>
<p>大凡以小說編成戲劇者，在於善剪裁，去繁就前，歸納在數幕中，但又不能遺其精華。我以為以小說編戲劇，其難過　為戲劇而編戲劇，倘然以外國小說而改編中國戲刺，必多遷就附會之處，其難比較以中國小說改編為尤甚。朱梵先生以美國密西爾女士原作，描　南北美戰爭時情况的「飄」改編為中國話劇，頗有手法、頗見思致、即如郝思　在未嫁白瑞德之前、曾經嫁有兩個丈夫，而他把兩個丈夫、歸納為一個丈夫是也。</p>
<p>就『囑』的演出而言：這是可以說得是藍開一個人的戲，藍開很能刻畫出一個個性剛强女子。而處處為男性所壓服，密西爾女士這部小說，不僅寫種族不平等，也寫男女不平等。劇中以郝思嘉為主角，其他如白瑞德，韓　　，兩人為劇中較重要的人，像石揮的衛西里一角，簡直無戲可做，即使有長才也顯不出，我以為白瑞德一角，給石揮做，或者他能發揮一點嗎？那是我個人的　想。</p>
<p>凡戲劇的足以感動人的，便是好戲，『飄」是足以感動人的。不過我以為末一幕應得略變，變得明朗一點，當白瑞德憤然出走，而郝思　要求同去的時候，觀衆必不說郝思嘉的澈悟，而說郝思嘉的　伏，（尤其是觀衆中的女性）。這不是戲劇的要團問，是為了郝思嘉的個性。</p>

<h3>福利經費統籌募　中央曁上海成立委員會　今日聯合舉行第一次會議</h3>
<p>社會福利事業經費，應統一籌專，各方均般切盼望，國府社會福利部，於數月前徵集各方意見，藥訂各省市縣社會福利經實統一籌募要綱，提請行政院會議通過，並巳由行政院公佈施行，此後各省市縣據以籌敎福利經費，常較便利。</p>
<p>過去各私辦社會福利事業，常對外任意　募捐款，以資補助，此後除應進照各省市縣社會福利經費統一籌募要綱辦理外。幷另訂有私辦社會福利事業勸募經費規則，亦巳由社會福利部呈請行政院核定，不日公佈施行。</p>
<p>滬委員會人選決定</p>
<p>根據各　市縣福利經費統一籌募要綱，各省市縣應設社地福利經費籌募委員會，茲悉上海特別市該項委員會不日即可成立，所有該會組織及人選，由社會福利部與上海市政府審愼商酌，亦巳決定，眩會主任委員，例由各地社會福利局局長兼任、上海以情形特殊，孫鳴岥局長表示賺該，茲決不設主任委員，即由常務委員負責，所有該會常務委員姓氏錄次：</p>
<p>李思浩，林康侯，袁履登，　　　，聞蘭亭。</p>
<p>委員姓氏如次：（以姓氏筆劃為序）王伯元，沈嗣良，吳蘊齋，周作民，孫鳴岥，凌憲文，徐鐵珊，唐壽民，秦潤卿，陳彬　，黃金榮，項康原，葉扶霄，潘達，潘三省。該會設書記長一人，負責處理日常事務，由社會福利局孫局長兼任，以資便利，辦公處即設於市商會之內。</p>
<p>中央委會亦設上海又悉社會福利部亦設有中央社會福利經費籌募委員會，　責　募全國福利經費，委員長由丁部長兼任，常務委員及委員人選，與上海福利經　　寡委員會完全一致，他日或擬在其他省市，延攬名流士　若干人，亦參加為委員。中央　募委員會設秘書長一人，亦由委員孫鳴峽兼任，辦公處亦設於上海，使中央與上海二委員會打成一片，以一事權而便統籌，丁部長對此，殊煞費苦心。</p>
<p>今日舉行聯合會議</p>
<p>中央及上海社會福利經費籌募委員會，閱經雙方商定，訂三日下午三時聯合舉行第一次會議，地點假座第八區前法國總會，屆時丁部長將親臨主持，滬市府亦由趙秘書長代表主持，各常委及委員，均將踴躍出席，商討一切，努力推進。</p>

<p>滬來捲烟黑市，雖經關係當局取締，但依然異常猖獗，茲悉當局為澈底消　捲烟黑市起見，對此將予進一步之措置，對於巳定限價之捲烟，凡小　商零售商皆須恪守限價　渝，其他無限價之捲烟，足供奸商囤積操縱者，當局對此亦將予以評定限價，並將組織一捲烟評價委員會，以資評定，故今後市上無論任何捲烟，皆將有一標準價格。</p>
<p>籲請警務機關協助</p>
<p>關係當局並為使取締工作有效起見，除展請種種必要之措置外，並將　請警務機關協助，目下關係當局巳派員分赴各烟店，密查共有無違法情事，同時亦派員至各娛樂塲，酒樓，旅館偵查，對於街頭小販，亦予以嚴屬取締。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>織布紡紗</h3>
<p>自從棉紗棉布收買以後，我們最大的渴望，一方面是合理的紗布配給方案之早日公布實施，使民衣供應，無　匱乏，一方面是繼續地努力於棉紗綿布之製造，使產品供應無處斷絕，二者－配給與生產－必須相輔而行，然後可以說到「取之不盡，用之不竭」的物資洪應狀態，蔚為戰時經濟的繁榮。</p>
<p>在紗布配給方案不久便將公布實施之前夕，我們對於紗布生產的前途，是可以抱着學觀的，因為事實告訴我們，華商紡　界本年八月份之操業狀態。其生產額僅為百分之一二·六，但自九月份起，因棉花原料獲得公平確定之配給，故　業成綫增加一成至二成半，而預料十月份起，由於棉業專會之解散，改為棉花部，且適值新棉登塲之期，故一般均深信共產額將更增加。目前華商紡織廠三十三家，而完全由華商經營者亦有十六家，華商紡織廠之陣容，不可謂不是相當的堅强，益以最近行政院核准公布之「棉花統買統配暫行辦法」，則製造棉製品之原料問題，應亦不成為一種疑問了。所以，今後的織布紡紗運動，更當圓滑推進，因此更可配合棉紗布之統制政策，使於抑平物價，安定民生的宏旨，更多一層貨獻，這是我們所期待於負生產責任的華商紡績界者，更是我們所期待於負鼓勵生產責任的政府常局者。</p>

<h3>關於改善蛋類配給的建議</h3>
<p>— 王波明</p>
<p>米為民主要之食　　為　　中極據　效之物。而亦列於·食·工之要物　外埠產量極要　？來滬之交通亦較共他物件使利？以余親覓目蛋類進貨、日方約千　之鉅？而我方約占陸怕　、以此平均分配一百另八家蛋商，蓋每一蛋商約得食陸雜左右？成交約售洋一萬元左·以百分之五利息針算？亦可有五百元　洋？日常開消足可夠矣？對於蛋類之售價向較各物低廉？近為一般蛋商揉　。將所　之貨？私行抬高售價？近　月之黑市？令人開之幾使欲駭？從本月二十五日起由門售20%以捐？而又改販批亦徵？此實給於我每一蛋販？極重之　　？而更增重民食又一負担？余覺不公？試想之</p>
<p>等？亦不列於工料？更次於蛋之營　？又非平常附級所能受用？反無　捐？　捐原係每一市民應蠱之義務與賣任？我並非是反對當局　捐？而我極希望當局能有徹底收受是項稅？方不有舉市民？</p>
<p>余略舉微捐五日內舞弊與黑市售價如下：（廿五日）售價加捐二十七元五角不加捐二十八元？（二十六日）加捐二十八元五角不加　二十九元（三十七日）（二卞八日）加捐三十一元，不加捐三十一元五角（二十九日）亦略同？總而言之？雖有少數付捐者？亦不　於任何證件？又有少數蛋商？運用施巧？另立賬册？價吞捐款？余想共他各業商號亦未必不然吧？</p>
<p>今後態注意下列數點</p>
<p>甲，根絕零售吞款：</p>
<p>由當局明令通告添般零售捐調查員及聯絡　員，往來路上調查。</p>
<p>限制每一顧客在未出商號時須素取徵捐收據</p>
<p>警員及指派調查得隨時檢查顧客收據及商號存根是否相同。</p>
<p>再由當局通告，持收據人須保存該項收據，積滿百張時，交捐務處，再由捐務處按資發給獎金，或　狀以示　　。</p>
<p>乙，改進配給彈類</p>
<p>由當局通告明令蛋　公會及蛋　聯　會合組於本市設三大配貨組。一，虹口區。二，滬西區。三，中心區奮興街。</p>
<p>關於收貨組可設外　產蛋區每一鄉鎭一所本埠收貨組除配貨組帶收外亦可另設二處。一，外　碼頭。二，火車站。</p>
<p>關於資金一案，可由各蛋認購股票。</p>
<p>辦事員由各蛋商號抽取十分之七人　作。</p>
<p>五辮事員薪金，由聯合發給，與蛋商無涉。</p>
<p>配法分二種。一，蛋商市部。二，蛋　與兼業蛋小商號。</p>
<p>領貨手續亦分二種：一，蛋商以推派代表具領。二，菜塲蛋販亦以菜塲大小派代表具領兼業蛋號，亦歸　近菜傷領取。</p>
<p>配價蛋商販號等均須一律。</p>
<p>以上配合制如能實現，對零售捐可作為總一進口收受，則萬民之幸也。（移酬助學）</p>

<h3>Improving the Judiciary</h3>
<p>The judiciary, within the political system, holds a transcendent position, with its own independent and sacred mission. "Crimes must be reported, and judgments must be fair" represents the ultimate goal of the legal system. In a society where this principle prevails, there will undoubtedly be consistent peace and stability, and the people's interests will certainly be fully protected. This holds true for a nation as well. Therefore, the degree of rigor in the judicial system and the extent to which legal efficacy is achieved can reveal the order of a country and its society.</p>
<p>Our country has long been working to establish a modern judicial system. The number of people studying law in specialized schools accounts for the largest portion of all academic disciplines. In terms of the sheer number of judicial talents, it can be said that there are more people than positions. However, in terms of the effectiveness of the rule of law, there is still a considerable distance from perfection. What is particularly disheartening is that judicial organs, in political institutions, objectively seem to have become a cold and forgotten corner, almost forgotten by the general public, or at least viewed as unimportant. Furthermore, the national expenditures on judicial funding do not occupy an important position. Judicial organs are makeshift and inadequate, giving a sense of desolation. Judicial personnel are poorly paid, leading to a mindset of complacency. A few unscrupulous individuals are even tempted by material desires, engaging in improper schemes. Under these circumstances, the transcendent and independent spirit of the rule of law is obscured, and social order fails to be consolidated. While the entire responsibility cannot be placed on the judicial organs, they are certainly not without blame for failing to fully fulfill their mission of upholding the rule of law. We hope that those in the judicial field will rise up, take responsibility with courage, and strive for continuous improvement, so as to achieve the effectiveness of the rule of law.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai's concession was taken over, judicial power has been unified. For judicial administration and the adjudication of cases within the Shanghai area, progress should logically be made gradually, converging towards unity compared to the concession era. This would set a precedent for a new atmosphere after the takeover of the concession. Especially after various friendly nations abolish extraterritorial rights, improvements in the judiciary, in particular, will serve as a benevolent response to those nations.</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities in the Ministry of Judicial Administration have been actively rectifying judicial administration and personnel matters. They are overcoming sentiments and arresting and punishing those who are greedy and accept bribes. We deeply admire the judicial authorities' emphasis on legal discipline. At the same time, we call for the consolidation of the entire judicial system and the full realization of the effectiveness of the rule of law. Regarding future policies for advancing judicial administration, we would like to offer a few words for the authorities' consideration:</p>
<p>First, the allocation of judicial funding should be determined and included in the national budget, just like other important political departments. To strengthen the judicial system, all necessary expenses should be willing, and in principle, there should be no bias or disparity.</p>
<p>Second, once funding is established, adjusting the compensation of judicial personnel is an urgent and unavoidable task. It is already difficult for administrative officials to be incorruptible, but it is even more difficult for judicial officials to maintain integrity. This is because judicial officials exercise their powers directly and have a vested interest with the parties involved, making them most susceptible to bribery and corruption. Therefore, the salaries of judicial officials must, in any case, be sufficient to support their personal and family lives. As the judicial elder Zhang Yipeng said, what is the income of a low-level judge today? Less than a rickshaw puller's. What is the income of a mid-level judge? Less than a barber's. What is the income of a high-level judge? Less than a store manager's. With such compensation, demanding such important responsibilities, it is indeed difficult for them to fulfill their duties. Of course, we do not mean to imply that low pay justifies seeking illicit gains. However, it is undeniable that low pay is a contributing factor to corruption.</p>
<p>We would like to propose the above two matters as prerequisites for improving the judiciary. As for other technical improvements, there is no shortage of suggestions from judicial experts, so we will not discuss them here for the time being.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang Announces Recognition of the Provisional Government of India; Sino-Indian Relations Grow Closer</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Provisional Government of Free India was established on the 21st of last month, and the National Government has declared its recognition. The Chairman has also issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Indian Independence League, led the Indian people on the 21st of last month to establish a provisional government, hoping to break the shackles of British imperialism and achieve the long-cherished aspirations of Indian independence and autonomy. We are truly admiring and excited to hear this news. The Indian people have made many efforts and struggles to achieve independence and autonomy before today. Although British imperialism has been extremely cruel, it has not immediately succeeded. However, the Indian people are not discouraged by this, and the resistance movement is becoming increasingly vigorous. This spirit of perseverance is sufficient to overcome difficulties and ultimately succeed. Now that the Greater East Asia War has erupted, the Allied nation of Japan has used its naval and land forces to inflict a major blow on the ambitions and atrocities of the British Empire. The Allied nation of Japan has also called for the liberation of East Asia and the assistance of East Asian nations in achieving independence, thereby building mutual prosperity. Inspired by this, the Indian people's independence movement has reached a climax. Mr. Bose, with his abundant wisdom and experience in overcoming dangers, has emerged as the leader of the Indian independence movement, and will surely work together with the Allied nation of Japan and the nations of East Asia to thwart British imperialism's domination of the East, and further crush the Anglo-American scheme to occupy the world, so that Indian independence and East Asian co-prosperity can be realized simultaneously. Since China and India began trading, they have valued cultural harmony in history. Now, with a consistent political direction, the relationship between the two nations will become closer day by day, jointly advancing towards a bright future. I express my sincere congratulations and joy.</p>
<h3>Telegram of Congratulations to Bose</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Provisional Government of India has been declared established, and the National Government sent a telegram of recognition on the 1st through Foreign Minister Chu to Chairman Subhas Chandra Bose of India. Chairman Wang of the National Government sent a telegram of congratulations to Subhas Chandra Bose on the 2nd. The original telegram is as follows: "To His Excellency Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, I am delighted to learn that Your Excellency established a provisional government on the 21st of this month, leading the people to fight resolutely for independence and autonomy. I express my deep sympathy and believe that the long-cherished wish of the 300 million people of India to seek freedom will surely be fulfilled, and the day of brilliant glory is coming soon. I send this telegram to congratulate you and wish Your Excellency good health. Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Holds Banquet</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) –</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu held a welcome dinner at his official residence at 6:30 p.m. on the 2nd, hosting Subhas Chandra Bose and Lieutenant Colonel Hoss, Chief of Staff of the Indian National Army, Minister of State Sahay, as well as Privy Councilor Ishii, Director General of the Information Bureau Amau, Chairman of the Japan-India Association Ota Shinanojo, Ambassador to Burma Sawada, and others. The dinner ended at 8:30 p.m. in a cordial atmosphere.</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister's Speech</p>
<p>During the dinner, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu delivered a welcoming speech, stating that India has been groaning under British oppression for a long time, and the suffering of India is the suffering of all Asia. The sorrow of India is also the sorrow of Asia. He was deeply grateful that Mr. Bose had emerged to fight for the freedom of India. The influence of the Anglo-Saxons in East Asia has been completely driven out, and the situation in India has improved. Today, the Japanese army has arrived at the gates of India, and Asia has resolutely risen, determined to control its own destiny. We are fighting to liberate Asia from the Anglo-Saxons and to seek peace and prosperity in Greater East Asia based on political equality and economic freedom. Therefore, it is natural that the desire for Indian independence has become even stronger after the success of the Japanese military operations. At this juncture, it is most opportune for India to establish the Provisional Government of Free India under the leadership of Mr. Bose. All the people of Asia deeply express their joy at this. The Japanese government's immediate recognition of the Provisional Government of India is nothing more than an expression of the enthusiasm of the Japanese people. Now, we must unite and work together to win the final victory and liberate Asia.</p>
<p>Bose's Reply Bose replied, saying that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, we have repeatedly received the sympathy and assistance of your country. Now, we are deeply grateful for your country's recognition of the Provisional Government of Free India. I deeply feel the great responsibility of my Indian people. We must fight for freedom until we completely defeat the enemy. I am confident that with the strong support of your country, we will be able to achieve liberation. I am deeply ashamed that I cannot repay the sympathy and assistance given by your government and your people. I am confident that we will be able to stand on the battlefield and fight against the enemy, and we will be able to overcome all difficulties and endure sacrifices to show our gratitude. When we use our blood to achieve our common goals, Asia will be built on a truly lasting foundation. Only with the blood and enthusiasm of our Asian people can we exchange for the brightness of Asia.</p>
<h3>Subhas Chandra Bose Issues Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, met with a group of reporters on the 2nd and issued a statement expressing his gratitude to Japan for recognizing the Provisional Government of Free India. He also said that the morale of the entire Indian National Army to "Go to Delhi" will be even higher due to the birth of this provisional government. The main points of Mr. Bose's statement are as follows: After I assumed the position of Chairman of the Indian Independence League, I first strengthened the League and reorganized the Indian National Army. The main points I proposed to the League were total mobilization, and in response to the expectations of the Indian National Army, I directly assumed command of the army. "Go to Delhi" is the slogan of our army, and it has achieved great success in the army. Now, all of our soldiers are familiar with this slogan, and the only hope of all members is to start frontline work as soon as possible. After the reorganization and expansion of the Indian National Army, the Independence League was reorganized. We have reached the stage of making final preparations to begin the struggle for freedom. At this stage, it is necessary to establish the Provisional Government of Free India. The recognition of our government by the Government of the Empire of Japan has dealt a fatal blow to the enemy's propaganda against the new cooperative relationship between Japan and India. Now, we have gained the sincere trust of three million Indians residing in East Asia, and they are fully supporting our army. Moreover, we are now in close contact with the freedom movement within our country, so even the enemy cannot underestimate the importance of the Provisional Government. Since the Great Rebellion of 1857, it is the first time that the Indian people have risen up with weapons against the British under the leadership of their own government. There is no historical precedent for establishing a provisional government abroad. From our standpoint, it would be better to establish a provisional government within India. However, under today's circumstances, most of the well-known leaders of India are imprisoned, and the people within the country have been disarmed by the British. It is absolutely impossible to establish a provisional government within India and promote participation in the war under the leadership of the provisional government. Therefore, the Indians in East Asia must take on this important responsibility. The Provisional Government is not just for propaganda. The mission of the Provisional Government is to gain freedom and make a final struggle, expel British and American forces from India, and then establish peace and order in India. Therefore, the foundation for establishing a permanent, free Indian national government that integrates the will of the Indian people has been laid. Once this government is established, the current Provisional Government will immediately dissolve. The Provisional Government is a fighting organization, so it only has representatives necessary to carry out the struggle for freedom. When the Provisional Government advances into the territory of its home country, it will also decide to establish all the departments of a normal government. The mission of the Provisional Government is to begin and carry out the war for freedom, so the authority of the military representatives is greater than that of the representatives of the general administrative aspects of the cabinet. In short, from all aspects, the Provisional Government is an institution that implements warfare. Now, it has an army sufficient to protect the Indian people and the support of strong allies. Therefore, everything needed for future success has been obtained. From now on, only the final struggle will begin to obtain freedom. The anti-Axis countries all tout freedom and democracy and pay lip service to the Atlantic Charter, but they suppress the countries under their control and seize the freedom of countries such as Iran and Iraq. Looking at Japan, it has successively promised independence to the Philippines and Burma, and has recognized the Provisional Government of Free India. Since India accounts for one-fifth of the world's population,</p>
<p>Supporting the independence movement of India truly contains great significance and individuality. I believe that it is easy to judge who in the world is fighting for justice and morality.</p>
<h3>Minister Lin Xuan Broadcasts to the Nation: A Just Peace and an Alliance of Righteousness</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Minister Lin Xuan of the Department of Propaganda broadcast to the nation from 9:30 p.m. to 10:15 p.m. on the 2nd, with the theme "A Just Peace and an Alliance of Righteousness" on the Central Broadcasting Station. He first mentioned that the revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty was realized on October 30th. After everyone read the full text of the new treaty and listened to the Chairman's instructions, they gained infinite courage for the country's future and the overall situation in East Asia. Next, he explained the following three questions: Why can we obtain such just peace terms? What about Chongqing after obtaining just peace terms? Finally, he said that we must also work hard for the country's security and development, for the co-prosperity and liberation of East Asia, saving on clothing and food, and diligently performing our public duties. We must also loudly appeal here to practice the Sino-Japanese Alliance and realize a just peace, consolidate the alliance of righteousness, mobilize all manpower and material resources, implement the final battle, defeat the British and Americans, revive China, and defend East Asia.</p>
<h3>Minister Kishi Expresses His Impressions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) –</p>
<p>Mr. Kishi Iwaichi, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in China, went to Japan on official business some time ago. Having completed his mission, he returned to Nanjing some days ago. The Central News Agency reporter specially paid a visit and was pleased to receive his impressions on various points that the reporter asked about, as follows: I originally wanted to come to Nanjing before the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty was concluded, but due to bad weather, the plane could not take off. I returned to Shanghai on October 31st and arrived in Nanjing on the 1st, failing to participate in the grand ceremony of the Sino-Japanese alliance, which I deeply regret. This trip back home was quite short, staying only ten days in a flash. The deepest impression of this trip is the enthusiasm of the general young students in the country for building Greater East Asia. Now, Japanese teenagers see the importance of the current situation and are unwilling to idle in schools, strongly advocating that they all rise up and give up their studies to join the military, serving the country and fulfilling the great mission of liberating the Asian nations. Their will is very firm. At the same time, Japanese women are also doing their best in the production sector in the rear. Now, most of the general work in Japan, except for those that must be operated by men under the age of 45, is done by women, and they are showing great efficiency. Whether they are talented ladies or ordinary women, they are united in their efforts to increase production. Therefore, Japan's wartime lineup is becoming stronger and stronger. Only young children are idle all day long. I predict that the new batch of reinforcements in Japan, coupled with the cooperation of the Allied nation of China, will definitely make the future of the Greater East Asia War very bright.</p>
<h3>Special Broadcast on the Sino-Japanese Alliance</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Today is the third day of the special broadcast on the Sino-Japanese Alliance.

The broadcast stations from all circles.</p>
<h3>Telegrams from All Sectors Pay Respects to Chairman Wang</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Since the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new and epoch-making stage. The whole country enthusiastically supports it and sends telegrams to Chairman Wang to pay their respects. The names of the sectors are recorded below: Hubei Provincial Governor Yang Kuiyi and the heads of various departments and bureaus. Representatives of the New People's Society.

<h3>US Coal Miners in Serious General Strike; Roosevelt Ordered Acceptance of All Mines the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Akan City, Argentina, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from New York, the temporary resumption of work by coal miners in the eastern United States expired at midnight on the 31st. Now, a general strike has virtually occurred. Workers belonging to the Coal Miners Union left their workplaces between midnight on the 31st and the morning of the 1st. Although the Coal Miners Union authorities have not yet issued a general strike order, according to reports from coal mines across the country, 530,000 miners had left their workplaces within a day, and it is reported that the union branches in major coal mining areas, such as smokeless and smoky mines, have issued instructions to the miners who have left the mines to begin a strike. According to the United Press's survey of various locations on the morning of the 1st, 240,000 miners in the states of West Virginia and Virginia have expressed their determination to strike. In addition, the 22,000 miners in Alabama, who were the first to start the strike, have also stated that they will not resume work until a new contract is established. In addition, it is expected that 23,000 in southern Illinois, 12,000 in Indiana, 25,000 in Ohio, 33,000 in Kentucky, 18,000 in Virginia, and 75,000 miners in western states will participate in the strike. The Coal Miners Union General Assembly also convened about 200 representatives from various local branches on the morning of the 1st in Washington to hold a policy committee. The meeting may end in the afternoon. It is not yet clear whether it will decide to order a general strike or ask the striking workers to resume work immediately. However, judging from the current strike situation in various places, even if the General Assembly does not approve the strike, a general strike may be difficult to avoid. Therefore, the government may take a strong stance on this.</p>
<p>Akan City, Argentina, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Washington, Roosevelt ordered the seizure of coal mines on the evening of the 1st. At the same time, Interior Secretary Ickes also signed an executive order to accept all coal mines producing more than 30 tons of coal per day and appointed the mine owners as trustees of the coal mines. Roosevelt specified in the seizure order that the striking workers resume work before noon on the 3rd. If the workers refuse to resume work, they will be severely punished in accordance with the Anti-Strike Act. The Coal Workers Union authorities have not expressed their opinions on the President's move. It is believed that the Coal Workers Union will convene a policy committee at 4:00 p.m. on the 2nd to order the workers to stop the strike.</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest Spreads to Western Canada</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – New York News: The US miner turmoil has now spread to Western Canada. 1,400 miners in Knat Tuthum, Kim Guan, Vancouver, Bilingsiden, British Columbia, and other places have gone on strike due to demands for a day off and increased wages. The US Miners Federation's policy committee failed to decide on effective action at yesterday's meeting. During the negotiation period between mine owners and unions, the policy committee decided to hand it over to a subcommittee to decide. Its report is expected to be issued today.</p>
<h3>Japan's Imperial Headquarters Announced the Battle Situation on New Guinea Island Yesterday; Preparations for the Next Phase of Operations on the Yunnan-Burma Border</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Japan's Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 p.m. on the 2nd: The battle situation on New Guinea Island, near Finschhafen, our troops heavily damaged the enemy forces with a brave offensive and then reorganized their positions in preparation for another battle. From October 16 to October 29, the main battle results that have been identified are as follows: 3,648 enemy bodies were abandoned, 6 cannons and approximately 650 guns were captured, approximately 14,000 rounds of special ammunition were seized, 10 enemy cannons were destroyed, 2 ammunition depots and 3 food warehouses were destroyed. Our side suffered 422 deaths. In the southern area of Madang, our troops are still bravely attacking the enemy forces that have repeatedly been strengthened. Since late September, the damage inflicted on the enemy has been no less than a thousand. On the Yunnan-Burma border, the war is progressing smoothly. The troops on our side have completely cut off the retreat route of the Chongqing army west of the Nu River, sweeping away the remnants of the enemy everywhere, and preparing for the next phase of operations. The main battle results obtained by our army from the first ten days of October to the 27th are as follows: 1,020 enemy bodies were abandoned, 110 prisoners were captured, and approximately 23,000 rounds of ammunition were seized.</p>
<h3>Macao Correspondence: The US Air Force Stationed in Chongqing Is Nominal</h3>
<p>— Jian Ping</p>
<p>Anti-sentiment Arises Among Chongqing Soldiers and Civilians</p>
<p>The American Air Force stationed in Chongqing takes Kunming as its base, and sets up forward bases with Guilin, Chongqing, etc. as intermediary bases. It originally hoped to air raid the Japanese mainland and cut off the supply route to the south. Since the end of July to the beginning of this month, it has been continuously air raided by Japanese aircraft, and all bases have been severely damaged, especially with heavy losses in aircraft, equipment, and air force personnel. Therefore, Stilwell and other top leaders flew to New Delhi to discuss the reorganization of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the replenishment of personnel and equipment with the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Command. The continuous defeats of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing have greatly disappointed Chongqing, thus making the pessimistic view of the future of the war of resistance more profound and widespread. Chongqing originally expected the US Air Force to send cadres and supply aircraft and other materials to rebuild the Chongqing Air Force. However, the United States refused this request and dispatched its own air force to Chongqing, forcing the Chongqing army to bear the base construction and ground work. Regarding combat, it also refused to contact the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission. As a result, the "guests dominated the host," making Chongqing a subordinate of the US Air Force.</p>
<p>Chongqing still advocates slogans such as "The United States is helping China in the war, and all our soldiers and civilians should repay it with righteousness," providing various conveniences in operations, and undertaking local tasks such as construction, communication, and meteorological observation in a certain place. Soldiers and civilians in various places even set up banquets and treated the American Air Force with suspicion. However, the tyrannical American Air Force absolutely did not contact the Chongqing army in combat, so Chongqing felt disappointed and angry. This is not only due to the secretiveness of the US Air Force, but also due to the US Air Force's distrust of the Chongqing army and its adherence to egoism. Therefore, the US Air Force has not yet fought with the Chongqing army, and there is almost no assistance in its operations. For example, when Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing at the end of July, the US Air Force abandoned the Chongqing army's P34 fighter jets and fled in a panic. This egoism of the US military has aroused resentment among the soldiers and civilians of Chongqing. Although the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Command is currently discussing ways to strengthen the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, Chongqing's distrust of it is increasing day by day. (Mailed on October 24)</p>
<h3>Burma Front: Japanese Air Force Active, Shot Down 30 Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – After the rainy season on the Burma front, the air war has become increasingly fierce. Japanese aircraft squadrons in this area shot down 30 enemy aircraft in mid-October, including 22 unified P34 models and other large aircraft, and the rest were P34P34 and other types of fighter aircraft. At the same time, joint formations of Japanese fighter-bombers have bombed enemy ships and military facilities in the Arakan region several times in a row, achieving great results. During this period, four Japanese aircraft crashed or did not return.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacking Bougainville Island Shot Down Seventeen</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific on the 2nd, a total of 130 enemy fighter-bombers attacked the Japanese army positions on Buka Island, the northern end of Bougainville Island, twice on the morning of the 1st. The Japanese garrison on the island shot down 17 of them with anti-aircraft guns, and Japanese land facilities were slightly damaged.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Clears Communist Troops in Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>Beijing, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese forces in Shanxi province, aiming to reduce the strength of the communist troops operating in the southern and northern parts of the province, launched a fierce attack on September 26th and are currently engaged in a clearing operation near Xingjing. Japanese troops reached the Yellow River area on September 28th, securing key river crossing points. Simultaneously, the main Japanese force shifted its focus, traversing treacherous mountain ranges to sweep through various areas, expanding their gains. As of now, the results achieved by the Japanese army are as follows: 605 communist soldiers killed, 7 communist facilities destroyed, 11 light machine guns seized, 4 grenade launchers, 136 rifles, and 15 pistols, including automatic rifles and a large quantity of other military supplies.</p>
<p>Beijing, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - On October 2nd, Japanese troops initiated an operation in the Taiyue Mountains, unexpectedly breaking through the communist forces’ defenses in the rugged terrain and launching a new offensive. They first moved south, decisively defeating the main communist force, completely destroying military facilities and economic bases in the area, inflicting heavy damage. Subsequently, they forced the defeated communist troops towards the north bank of the Yellow River, now beyond the areas of Lüxian and Zezhou. The Japanese operation to clear communist troops in the Taiyue Mountains is now nearing its final stage.</p>
<h3>Viceroy of India Seeks Military Solution to Famine</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - It is reported that the Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell, in an attempt to address the escalating famine issue in the Bengal province, has effectively implemented military administration in the province, seeking a solution through force. Following his inspection of the disaster situation in the province, Wavell convened a relief strategy meeting in Calcutta on the night of October 29th, bringing together relevant parties to study countermeasures. Upon returning to New Delhi on the 30th, he appointed Lieutenant General Wickery as the Governor of Bengal province. Wickery has reportedly taken office, directing his subordinates to adopt a policy of military suppression to seek a swift resolution to the problem. Wavell's adoption of this emergency policy stems from the realization that the escalation of this issue is related to British domestic political problems and that he is trying to prevent the National Congress Party from exploiting this opportunity.</p>

<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - A military commentator from the German News Agency reports: "The fighting on the Eastern Front has reached a climax. The second stage is over. Judging from various observations, the third stage is approaching, but this will depend on winter weather conditions.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a report from the Huitong News Agency: "The battle for the Crimean Isthmus and Crimea must be viewed as part of the overall war. Although Soviet mobile units briefly penetrated our lines near the estuary, the enemy's advance towards Nikopol has not seen significant progress. However, their westward and southwestward advance is gradually gaining momentum. Nevertheless, the direction of the battle remains unpredictable, as the fighting between the enemy's mobile units that broke through the lower reaches of the Dnieper River and the Soviet mobile reserves continues. The gateway to Crimea remains in German hands, posing a constant threat to the flanks of the Soviet troops that have broken through. In short, the battles on the Nogai Steppe and in the Dnieper bend are closely related. In the latter area, Soviet attempts to attack the right wing of the German lines have been repelled. The German offensive against Soviet troops that broke through north and northwest of Krivoy Rog is progressing smoothly. Despite strong resistance, the German vanguard, reinforced by allied forces, is engaged in fierce fighting. In conclusion, while the fighting on the southern sector of the Eastern Front has reached its peak, no decisive outcome has yet been achieved. Both sides are concentrating all their efforts there, and the situation in other areas has gradually become calmer.</p>
<h3>German Forces in Italy Implement Delaying and Attrition Warfare, Complete Objectives and Defend New Front Lines</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German military authorities announced today that German forces in southern Italy have withdrawn from Guarone, located eleven miles east of Isernia. German forces on the western flank of this battle line continue to implement a delaying and attrition strategy. After inflicting heavy losses on the enemy through deliberate counterattacks over the weekend, German forces, as planned, retreated to new front lines located several kilometers behind. Although enemy forces have advanced to these new front lines, they have yet to grasp the German strategy. The enemy appears to be waiting for the effects of the advance of the main US forces in the central sector. These US forces, starting from the upper Volturno River, have turned west, apparently intending to attack Venafro and the Miletto Mountains. Conversely, the US military seems to have the intention of advancing north to attack Venafro and Monte Miletto. Enemy forces advancing towards Venafro from the Volturno Valley have been repelled. In the central Apennine Mountains, on the Venchiaturo-Isernia highway, and west of Campobasso, where the left flank of the British Eighth Army is operating, the situation has not changed significantly, and at least the enemy's pressure has not increased. The right wing of the British Eighth Army has gradually approached the upper and middle reaches of the Trigno River, but there is no sign of crossing the river. The bridgehead established by the coastal British forces on the north bank of the river is under constant threat from German artillery fire and has not been expanded.</p>
<p>Artillery Battle Occurs on the Western Coast</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (German News Agency dispatch) - Fierce fighting in the Volturno River basin continued on Sunday, while only scattered localized activity occurred in the Apennine Mountains. German coastal artillery units stationed near Gaeta on the western coast of Italy prevented attempts by British and American forces to bombard the city with naval artillery and drove away enemy warships. At the same time, military operations by German forces in the mountains on either side of the upper Volturno River and on the western coast have begun to show their effectiveness. The German forces there are utilizing the mountains as natural defensive lines and overcoming the various difficulties of the terrain with excellent skill. The German protection units in the southern mountainous area near the Volturno River, after completing their tasks in the fierce fighting of the past five days, have withdrawn to higher mountain positions, further increasing the enemy's supply difficulties. German forces withdrew from Pratella and Prata Sannita in the upper Volturno River area, while also abandoning the village of Carinola on the coast. British and American forces attempted to prevent the German withdrawal east of the Volturno River, resulting in fierce fighting. Although outnumbered, the German forces were able to hold their positions, and the German movements throughout the afternoon and evening were strongly protected.</p>

The three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, will establish international organizations as soon as possible, based on the principle of respecting the sovereignty of all countries. In addition, a declaration was issued.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - A communiqué issued in London stated that the tripartite conference, which concluded on Saturday after twelve consecutive days, had achieved three main results: the establishment of a European Advisory Commission, with its location in London, an agreement on parallel military actions, and the inclusion of all "peace-loving" countries in the international security organization system. Furthermore, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union reached agreements on the division of continental European territories and occupied areas. The communiqué also stated that the issues discussed at the conference were all issues submitted by the three governments for discussion. In addition to British Foreign Secretary Eden and US Secretary of State Hull, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Harriman, General Deane, Steinhardt, and other US State Department experts, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Kerr, General Ismay, and experts, Soviet Marshal Voroshilov, Deputy Foreign Ministers Vyshinsky and Litvinov, military experts, and Deputy Commissar for Foreign Trade Sergei were also present.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Approaching the American side, the Turkish newspaper "Turquie" still speculates that while British Foreign Secretary Eden is on his way back to London from Moscow, he may meet with Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu in Ankara, or the interim envoy will meet with Eden.</p>
<h3>Turkey Has a Strong Determination to Safeguard Independence and Freedom, President İsmet İnönü Reaffirms Policy</h3>
<p>Ankara, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Turkish President İsmet İnönü declared in his opening speech to parliament yesterday that the policy Turkey has adhered to over the past eight years is based on the principles of national independence and freedom. He stated, "Our foreign policy, since the crisis of 1935, has not changed. Our current view is still to uphold the principles of national independence and freedom to protect the foundation of our culture. Our political efforts tend to oppose those who attempt to undermine this culture. In order to avoid the scourge of war, we have unhesitatingly participated in actions that require the greatest courage. We have now witnessed the world's crisis gradually advancing on a destructive path, not only is the great work of culture frequently destroyed, but culture itself is buried in the rubble. This cruel and chaotic scramble for power has threatened the survival of all nations, and this chaotic war is intensifying and overturning all foundations built on humanitarianism. Our future course is clear. Although Turkey has not yet entered the scourge of war, it has been affected by the world crisis for four years and has made various sacrifices and efforts to overcome difficulties. For the sake of the whole world and for the sake of all mankind breathing free air, we are willing to endure all sacrifices. We wish that the victors in this war will be culture and humanity, and only in the unity with those who defend humanity and culture can we see the dawn of happiness and universal freedom." President İsmet stressed that defense should be strengthened at any opportunity, and parliament should trust that the Turkish army is sufficient to cope with any eventuality and task. The government's main task is to provide the army with excellent training and equipment.</p>
<p>Abstract Wording, Deep Meaning - Istanbul, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - President İnönü's speech to parliament explaining Turkey's foreign policy, based on maintaining the civilizational foundations of freedom and independence and rejecting the destructive forces of military politics and war, has attracted great attention as Turkey's attitude is being watched by the great powers. He did not use the word "neutrality" in his speech, which was especially emphasized by diplomatic circles in Ankara. The President also stated that Turkey rejects violent politics and is prepared to cooperate in maintaining order, which is also emphasized by diplomatic circles in various countries. It is generally believed that the President's use of such cautious language reflects the difficulty of Turkey's situation, and although the content of his speech is extremely abstract, it has very deep meanings.</p>

<h3>Special Rationing of Sugar Readjusted, All Rationing Stopped Except Those Approved by the Economic Department</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch - Since the implementation of sugar rationing based on population, the stock of sugar of Shanghai's Chinese merchants has long been completely allocated. Although the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office has ordered a large amount of sugar, the supply of sugar within this year should not be insufficient. However, in order to save on sugar consumption, the Shanghai authorities have specially readjusted the special sugar rationing. This readjustment measure will be implemented in a uniform manner throughout the city. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Re-establishing Rationing Methods to Conserve Sugar Consumption</p>
<p>Sugar is one of the main food sources for the 5 million citizens of Shanghai. In the past, the serious threat to the sugar supply was alleviated through the joint implementation of population-based sugar rationing by the Municipal Food Bureau and related parties. However, the stock of sugar in Shanghai is limited. Under the wartime system, conservation should be practiced. In order to conserve sugar consumption, the Economic Department of the authorities has, based on the principle of reviewing the legitimate needs, re-established the rationing method for special sugar in the first and eighth districts. The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office is required to strictly comply with the implementation. It is also hoped that other districts will take the same steps to promote the strengthening of the wartime system and support the government's aim to save resources.</p>
<p>Special Sugar Rationing Requires More Than One Million Jin Per Month</p>
<p>In the past, the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office rationed the following amounts of special sugar each month: pharmacies, 54,000 jin; hotels, restaurants, and cafes, 100,000 jin; confectionery factories, 620,000 jin; companies, firms, banks, temples, schools, and government agencies, 56,000 jin; hotels and other stores, 240,000 jin; foreign firms, shops, and factories, 66,000 jin. In total, the actual amount of sugar rationed each month reached a massive 1,136,000 jin.</p>
<p>The Economic Department Reviews the Need for Special Rationing</p>
<p>Regarding the interim measures for the readjustment of special sugar rationing established by the Economic Department, all special sugar rationing for companies, firms, banks, temples, schools, hospitals, government agencies, and foreign firms, shops, and factories will be completely stopped in the future. The rationing of sugar to pharmacies and hotels will also be temporarily stopped. In addition to preparing an application for sugar, each of these businesses must also provide a detailed report to the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, including the total amount of sugar used for their products, a description of sugar usage, and the amount of sugar in stock at the end of the month. After careful discussion with the Health Department, those deemed necessary or those that can be reduced will be selected. After review and approval by the Economic Department, a notification will be issued. The rationing of hotels, restaurants, and cafes will also be handled in accordance with the above regulations. For the sugar supply of confectionery factories, each manufacturer must clearly state the various quantities of sugar used for their products and the quantity of goods sold, as well as a description of sugar usage and the inventory of finished confectionery, and submit a separate report. This will also be reviewed and determined by the Economic Department before the quantity of sugar supplied is rationed.</p>
<p>Proper Sugar Supply Can Eliminate the Black Market</p>
<p>This measure by the Economic Department will not only ensure an adequate supply to legitimate businesses and promote the general conservation of sugar consumption, but it will also eliminate the black market for sugar. Since businesses are receiving a normal supply of sugar, there will be no surplus sugar to supply the black market. The first and eighth districts have already complied with the implementation, and other districts will also take the same steps to promote conservation.</p>

<h3>Eighth Phase of Sugar Distribution Begins Today</h3>
<p>The distribution date for the eighth phase of sugar for households is set from today until the 12th.

Retail stores, upon receiving each eighth certificate with the store number, should sell half a jin of refined white sugar, priced at 2.4 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, excluding packaging costs. The retail tax is temporarily waived. The district offices of both districts have notified merchants accordingly.</p>

<h3>Concrete Plan for Coal Briquette Rationing Drafted, Expected to be Implemented This Month</h3>
<p>The coal briquette problem remains extremely alarming. Illegal retail stores, seeing that coal briquettes will soon be rationed, are ramping up their speculative activities to reap illegal profits. Currently, stores are secretly trading factory shipments on the black market, greatly harming legitimate users. It has been learned that in addition to severely investigating illegal stores, the authorities are intensifying efforts on rationing. Once rationing is implemented, the black market can be fundamentally eliminated. The relevant authorities have now completed a concrete plan for the implementation of coal briquette rationing and have obtained accurate household counts from the Baojia system. The monthly demand has also been calculated. Preliminary decisions have also been made regarding the division of retail merchant districts. With the efforts of all parties, rationing is expected to be implemented this month.</p>
<h3>After Watching "Gone with the Wind"</h3>
<p>- Tianxiao</p>
<p>Generally, when adapting a novel into a play, it is important to carefully cut and reduce it, condensing it into several acts, but without losing its essence. I think adapting a novel into a play is more difficult than writing a play from scratch. If a foreign novel is adapted into a Chinese play, there will inevitably be many compromises and contrivances, which is even more difficult compared to adapting a Chinese novel. Mr. Zhu Fan adapted Ms. Mitchell's American novel "Gone with the Wind," which depicts the situation during the American Civil War, into a Chinese drama with considerable skill and thought. For example, Scarlett O'Hara married two husbands before marrying Rhett Butler, and he combined the two husbands into one.</p>
<p>Regarding the performance of "Gone with the Wind": it can be said to be a play with Lan Kai as the central character. Lan Kai is very capable of portraying a woman with a strong personality who is constantly oppressed by men. Ms. Mitchell's novel not only writes about racial inequality but also about gender inequality. Scarlett O'Hara is the protagonist of the play, while Rhett Butler and Ashley Wilkes are the more important characters. Shi Hui's role as Ashley Wilkes is simply inconsequential, and even with talent, he cannot show it. I think if Shi Hui played Rhett Butler, perhaps he could develop it a little? That is my personal thought.</p>
<p>Any play that can move people is a good play. "Gone with the Wind" is enough to move people. However, I think the last scene should be slightly changed and made brighter. When Rhett Butler angrily leaves and Scarlett O'Hara asks to go with him, the audience will not say that Scarlett O'Hara has realized the truth but will say that Scarlett O'Hara is subservient (especially the female audience). This is not a question of the drama itself but of Scarlett O'Hara's personality.</p>
<h3>Report on Scholarship Donations</h3>
<p>The following is a list of the Shen Bao scholarship donations received yesterday: Kang Na Xin Confectionery Factory, 1,000 yuan; Pei Bingxi (transferred from Mr. Li Runtian's 50th birthday celebration), 500 yuan; Mr. Wang (savings from daily thrift), 200 yuan; Mr. Chen Xinbo, Mr. Jun, 100 yuan each; Mr. Bian, 40 yuan; Mr. Tang, Pu Jiting (praying for health of relatives and friends remotely), 10 yuan each; total received, 1,960 yuan. The remaining balance is 2,448,704 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's broadcast time was 7:40 PM.</p>
<h3>Unified Fundraising for Welfare Expenses: Central Government and Shanghai Establish Committees, First Joint Meeting Held Today</h3>
<p>There is a general desire for the unified fundraising of social welfare expenses. The Ministry of Social Welfare of the National Government, after collecting opinions from various parties several months ago, drafted the "Essentials for Unified Fundraising of Social Welfare Expenses in Provinces, Cities, and Counties," which was submitted to and approved by the Executive Yuan meeting and has been promulgated and implemented by the Executive Yuan. Hereafter, it will be more convenient for provinces, cities, and counties to raise welfare funds based on this.</p>
<p>In the past, privately run social welfare undertakings often arbitrarily solicited donations from outside to subsidize themselves. From now on, in addition to complying with the "Essentials for Unified Fundraising of Social Welfare Expenses in Provinces, Cities, and Counties," there will also be "Regulations for Fundraising Expenses for Privately Run Social Welfare Undertakings," which have been submitted by the Ministry of Social Welfare to the Executive Yuan for approval and will be promulgated and implemented soon.</p>
<p>Shanghai Committee Members Determined</p>
<p>According to the "Essentials for Unified Fundraising of Welfare Expenses in Provinces, Cities, and Counties," each province, city, and county should establish a local Welfare Expenses Fundraising Committee. It is learned that the Shanghai Special Municipality Committee will be established soon. The organization and membership of the committee have been carefully discussed by the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Shanghai Municipal Government and have been determined. The chairman of the committee is usually concurrently held by the director of the local Social Welfare Bureau. However, due to Shanghai's special circumstances, Director Sun Mingduo expressed his reluctance. It has now been decided not to appoint a chairman, and the standing committee members will be responsible. The names of the standing committee members are listed below:</p>
<p>Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, , Wen Lanting.</p>
<p>The names of the committee members are as follows (in order of the number of strokes in their surnames): Wang Boyuan, Shen Siliang, Wu Yunzhai, Zhou Zuomin, Sun Mingduo, Ling Xianwen, Xu Tieshan, Tang Shoumin, Qin Runqing, Chen Bin , Huang Jinrong, Xiang Kangyuan, Ye Fuxiao, Pan Da, Pan Sanxing. The committee will have one secretary-general, responsible for handling daily affairs, concurrently held by Director Sun of the Social Welfare Bureau for convenience. The office will be located within the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Central Committee Also Established in Shanghai</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Ministry of Social Welfare has also established a Central Social Welfare Expenses Fundraising Committee, responsible for fundraising for national welfare expenses. The chairman of the committee is concurrently held by Minister Ding. The standing committee members and committee members are completely consistent with the Shanghai Welfare Expenses Committee. In the future, it is planned to recruit some celebrities and gentry from other provinces and cities to participate as committee members. The Central Fundraising Committee will have one secretary-general, concurrently held by Committee Member Sun Mingduo. The office will also be located in Shanghai, so that the central and Shanghai committees can work together seamlessly, unifying authority and facilitating overall planning. Minister Ding has put a lot of effort into this.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting Held Today</p>
<p>After consultation between the central government and the Shanghai Social Welfare Expenses Fundraising Committees, it has been decided to hold the first joint meeting at 3:00 PM on the 3rd, at the former French Club in the Eighth District. Minister Ding will personally preside over the meeting, and Secretary-General Zhao will represent the Shanghai Municipal Government. All standing committee members and committee members will attend enthusiastically to discuss everything and work hard to promote the cause.</p>

<h3>Minister Songdao Discusses Wartime System in Japan; Japanese People All Have Unwavering Belief in Victory</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Colonel Songdao Keizo, the naval attaché of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, recently returned to Tokyo on official business to investigate the realities of Japan's wartime system. Now that he has completed his official duties and returned to Shanghai, Colonel Songdao met with a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday and made a statement on the current situation, saying: "This time, I returned to Tokyo on official business and witnessed the reality of the wartime system in Japan. In short, the entire Japanese population has an unwavering belief in victory in battle. There is no sign of fatigue or weakness anywhere in Japan. I am confident that even if the Greater East Asia War is prolonged, there will be no cause for concern. Of course, there are considerable restrictions on food, but this is an inevitable measure for a country establishing a wartime system. In other words, it is in preparation for future battles. Therefore, it is a mistake to make erroneous comments. Compared with the extreme dissatisfaction with food shortages in enemy countries like England and America, we can feel much more victorious. Women in Japan are all wearing short clothes, preparing for fearless air defense combat deployment. Students are also participating in suicide squads to go to the front lines, and the rest are also full of enthusiasm, hoping to serve the country after school. Seeing this situation, I am deeply grateful. A certain young man said to me: 'We will do our best to win the war. What we hope is to shout 'Long live the Emperor' at the last minute and die. We have no other request than to die in the right place.' I hope that the peoples of East Asia, who share the common goal of defeating England and America, can embody Japan's unified fighting spirit."</p>
<h3>Cigarette Evaluation Committee to be Established; Efforts to be Made to Suppress the Black Market</h3>
<p>Although the Shanghai cigarette black market has been suppressed by the authorities, it is still extremely rampant. It is learned that in order to completely eliminate the cigarette black market, the authorities will take further measures. For cigarettes with fixed prices, all small retailers and retailers must strictly abide by the fixed prices. For other cigarettes without fixed prices, which can be hoarded and manipulated by unscrupulous merchants, the authorities will also evaluate and fix prices. A Cigarette Evaluation Committee will be organized for evaluation. Therefore, in the future, all cigarettes on the market will have a standard price.</p>
<p>Appealing for Assistance from Police Authorities</p>
<p>In order to make the crackdown effective, the authorities will, in addition to implementing various necessary measures, also appeal for assistance from the police authorities. Currently, the authorities have dispatched personnel to various cigarette shops to secretly investigate any illegal activities. At the same time, personnel have also been dispatched to entertainment venues, restaurants, and hotels to investigate. Street vendors will also be strictly prohibited.</p>

<h3>Youth Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Registration Deadline Extended</h3>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Weaving and Spinning</h3>
<p>Since the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, our greatest hope is, on the one hand, the early announcement and implementation of a reasonable yarn and cloth allocation plan, so that the supply of clothing for the people is not scarce, and on the other hand, to continue to strive for the manufacturing of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, so that the supply of products is not interrupted. Both - allocation and production - must go hand in hand, and then we can talk about an inexhaustible supply of materials, creating a wartime economic prosperity.</p>
<p>On the eve of the imminent announcement and implementation of the yarn and cloth allocation plan, we can be optimistic about the future of yarn and cloth production because the facts tell us that the operating status of Chinese-owned textile companies in August of this year was only 12.6% of their production capacity. However, since September, due to the fair and certain allocation of cotton raw materials, the operating rate has increased by 10% to 25%. It is expected that from October onwards, due to the dissolution of the Cotton Industry Association and its replacement by the Cotton Department, and coinciding with the period when new cotton is coming onto the market, it is generally believed that the common output will increase further. Currently, there are 33 Chinese-owned textile factories, and 16 of them are completely operated by Chinese merchants. The lineup of Chinese-owned textile factories cannot be said to be not quite strong. Moreover, with the recently approved and promulgated "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Allocation of Cotton" by the Executive Yuan, the raw material problem for manufacturing cotton products should no longer be a question. Therefore, the weaving and spinning movement in the future should be promoted more smoothly, so that it can better cooperate with the cotton yarn and cloth control policy, and make a greater contribution to the important task of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. This is what we expect from the Chinese-owned textile industry, which is responsible for production, and it is also what we expect from the government authorities, which are responsible for encouraging production.</p>
<h3>Special Donation Office for Sericulture Construction to Handle Registration of Licenses; Methods Promulgated and Deadline Set for Completion Before the 10th</h3>
<p>The Special Donation Office for Sericulture Construction in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions of the Ministry of Finance, in order to adjust the situation of licenses held by silk mills, silk weaving mills, and merchants in the region, specially presented an order from the Ministry to formulate methods. Before the assessment of donations for autumn silk is determined, the old licenses held by merchants should be registered uniformly to prevent malpractices. Therefore, registration methods have been specially promulgated, ordering all silk and silk fabric manufacturers to promptly register all types of silk licenses they hold with the local special donation collection agency in accordance with the law before November 10th of this year. The original text of the fourteen articles of the method is recorded below:</p>
<p>Registration Method</p>
<p>This office has specially formulated this method in order to adjust the situation of licenses held by silk mills, silk weaving mills, and merchants in the region. All merchants such as silk mills, silk weaving mills, or customs declaration transportation companies (hereinafter referred to as "license holders") who hold licenses with the prefixes Tianjia, Tianyi, Tianbing, Caitianyi, thread donation licenses, Cai Zhi direct finished product donation licenses, Caitian single pure weaving mill thread and weaving separation licenses, and sub-transportation licenses must uniformly apply for registration from now until November 9th. All license holders must fill out the registration form with the prefixes of donation transportation licenses specified in the preceding article within the deadline and submit it together with the licenses held to the local collection agency for special donations on sericulture to apply for registration. All license holders under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai District should apply for registration with this office. Those under the jurisdiction of Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other regions should register with the respective branch offices. License holders who hold various donation transportation licenses who fail to apply for registration after the deadline will not be registered, and all licenses held will be invalidated. When this office and its branch offices receive the registration forms and licenses held by license holders, after registration, they will stamp "Registration Completed" and the date of registration on the licenses and immediately send personnel to verify the forms. If the licenses and goods are found to be consistent, they should stamp "Goods and License Consistent" on the licenses and return the original licenses to the original license holders. The licenses stamped with "Registration Completed" and "Goods and License Consistent" in the preceding article must bear the name and seal of the director of each branch office and the personnel handling the registration and verification. The above name seal and stamp should be submitted to this office for record. This office and its branch offices, after registering the various licenses held by license holders and sending personnel to verify them, if they find that the goods and licenses are inconsistent, they should retrieve the licenses and stamp them as invalid and collect supplementary donations for all goods according to the new valuation of the autumn season. This office and its branch offices, after registering the various licenses held by license holders and sending personnel to verify them, if they find that there are licenses but no goods, they should stamp "Invalidated for No Goods" on the licenses and retrieve them. Personnel handling license registration at this office and its branch offices, after completing the registration procedures, must submit the registration forms and licenses to the responsible officer for review. Only after the officer stamps the form and deems it appropriate for return may it be returned; otherwise, they must not act without authorization. Unregistered goods and goods that have been registered but not verified by this office and its branch offices are not allowed to be moved or declared for export. Registered goods, if the goods and licenses are found to be consistent and the licenses have been stamped with "Goods and License Consistent," should still report to the original registration collection agency when moving or exporting. All personnel handling license registration and verification at this office and its branch offices must not make things difficult, solicit any fees, or collude to conceal anything. Violators will be investigated and dealt with according to the law. Each branch office should submit the registration forms and registers and the recovered licenses to this office for review.</p>

Large and small Western clothing stores on this street and in other ports have been vigorously sourcing them because they are very much to the liking of Allied personnel. As a result, the tailors who specialize in making clothes for Allied personnel are purchasing Western suits and coats made entirely of grey and dark purple, creating a trend of brisk sales of plain woolen fabrics.</p>
<p>Artificial : Yesterday saw a slight increase, because cargo owners were unwilling to sell cheaply, leading to a price increase.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Japan's Production Capacity</h3>
<p>Measures to Strengthen the Domestic Situation</p>
<p>On September 22nd, the Japanese government, in a regular cabinet meeting, decided on "Measures to Strengthen the Domestic System." This is because, in order to cope with the intense final battle phase, it is urgently necessary to truly establish a domestic posture for the decisive battle. The purpose of these measures, as Prime Minister Tojo broadcast that day, is to "make decisive reforms in the operation of state affairs, further strengthen the relationship between the supreme command and state affairs, in order to carry out vigorous war guidance, and to implement swift and decisive foreign policies, while at the same time thoroughly strengthening the domestic strength and accelerating and dramatically enhancing war capabilities." The government's aim in strengthening the domestic situation is to rapidly increase military production with the strong force of the entire nation, especially aircraft production, and to establish a situation of absolute self-sufficiency in food, while thoroughly strengthening the domestic defense situation, so that this great war can be completely won.</p>
<p>Regarding these points, the government authorities have long attached importance to various decisive measures. Considering the importance of the war situation, they believe that the measures taken must not be delayed in the slightest, and therefore decided to implement them rapidly and forcefully.</p>
<p>Moreover, this "measure" adopts a special approach to strengthen the domestic situation, proposing a decisive transformation of administrative operations, so that the execution of government affairs is thoroughly swift and efficient, the duties of central government agencies are thoroughly transferred to local governments, and local administration is simplified and enlivened. In addition, the functions of local administrative councils are strengthened. Furthermore, simplification of the budget and streamlining of official affairs are sought, permission and approval matters are handled, and the document supervision system for important enterprises is abolished, in order to simplify the supervision system. Unnecessary administrative affairs during the decisive battle are strictly prohibited, and all administrative organs are reorganized, with a view to simplicity and efficiency. This will prepare a perfect system for carrying out the decisive battle administration.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this "measure" also lists detailed measures for thoroughly mobilizing the people and strengthening the domestic defense situation. In addition to the goal of increasing carrying capacity in the first article, second paragraph, it also establishes a responsible production system in the second article, fourth paragraph, listing the standardization of land transportation, strengthening taxes and national savings, thoroughly simplifying the price and rationing system, and thoroughly reorganizing and updating the second-line production sectors. Based on these measures, each provincial and state-level policy was drafted by September 26th, and formally decided by the Cabinet meeting by the end of September, to be implemented from October. There will be much to look forward to in this rapid and thorough practice. According to the Information Bureau, the full text of the measures is as follows:</p>
<p>Information Bureau Announcement (7:30 PM, September 22nd): Since the beginning of the Holy War, the government has implemented various necessary measures to carry out the war.

<p>Second, the special policies taken to strengthen the domestic situation are as follows:</p>

Note: Absolutely no wasting time, practice abolishing the half-day Saturday office system, and take measures to continue the functions of government offices without distinguishing between day and night shifts.</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly mobilize the people:</p>
<p>(A) Suspend the general postponement of enlistment, only allowing students in science and engineering fields to postpone enlistment. Reorganize and expand schools in the science and engineering fields, and integrate and consolidate universities and specialized schools in the liberal arts and law fields.</p>

<h3>Suggestions on Improving the Rationing of Eggs</h3>
<p>— Wang Boming</p>
<p>Rice is the main food for the people, and eggs are extremely nutritious. Eggs are also listed as important materials for food and industry. The output from other places is extremely important. Is the transportation of eggs to Shanghai easier than other items? I personally find that the daily egg imports amount to about a thousand. Our side accounts for about six-tenths. Averaging this to 108 egg merchants, each merchant gets about six hundred. The transaction price is about 10,000 yuan. Calculating with a 5% interest rate, there would be 500 yuan. Daily expenses would be sufficient. The selling price of eggs has always been lower than other goods. Recently, some egg merchants have manipulated the market. They secretly raise the selling price of the goods they get. The black market in recent months is shocking. Starting from the 25th of this month, sales at the door are taxed at 20%, and wholesale is also taxed. This is a very heavy burden on each of our egg vendors, and it further increases the burden on the people's food. I feel it is unfair. Consider:</p>
<p>are also not listed as industrial materials. Egg nutrition is superior to and cannot be afforded by ordinary people. Yet there are no taxes. Taxation is originally an obligation and responsibility that every citizen should bear. I am not against the authorities levying taxes, but I sincerely hope that the authorities can thoroughly collect this tax so as not to mislead the citizens.</p>
<p>I will briefly list the malpractice and black market prices of the five-day micro-tax as follows: (25th) selling price plus tax 27.5 yuan, without tax 28 yuan; (26th) plus tax 28.5 yuan, without tax 29 yuan; (27th), (28th) plus tax 31 yuan, without tax 31.5 yuan; (29th) also similar. In short, even if a small number of people pay taxes, they do not have any proof. There are also a few egg merchants who use tricks to set up separate accounts and embezzle tax money. I think other businesses are probably the same.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the following points in the future:</p>
<p>A. Eradicate embezzlement in retail:</p>
<p>The authorities should issue an order to add retail tax investigators and liaison personnel to investigate on the streets.</p>
<p>Limit each customer to obtaining a tax receipt before leaving the store.</p>
<p>Police officers and assigned investigators can check customers' receipts and store ledgers at any time to see if they are the same.</p>
<p>The authorities should also announce that receipt holders must keep the receipts, and when they have accumulated 100 receipts, they should hand them over to the tax office, which will then issue bonuses or certificates to show encouragement.</p>
<p>B. Improve the allocation of eggs</p>
<p>The authorities should issue an order to order the Egg Guild and the Egg Association to jointly establish three major distribution groups in this city: 1. Hongkou District. 2. West Shanghai District. 3. Fenxing Street in the Central District.</p>
<p>Regarding the receiving group, one receiving group can be set up in each township in the egg-producing area. In addition to the distribution group's receiving group, two more receiving groups can be set up in the local receiving group: 1. Wharves in other places. 2. Train station.</p>
<p>Regarding the funding case, each egg merchant can subscribe for stocks.</p>
<p>Seventy percent of the staff is drawn from each egg business.</p>
<p>The salary of the five staff members is issued jointly and has nothing to do with the egg merchants.</p>
<p>There are two types of allocation methods: 1. Egg merchants in the city. 2. Egg vendors and part-time egg small businesses.</p>
<p>There are also two types of receipt procedures: 1. Egg merchants appoint representatives to collect the goods. 2. Vegetable market egg vendors also send representatives to collect the goods according to the size of the vegetable market, and part-time egg shops also pick them up near the vegetable market.</p>
<p>The distribution price must be the same for egg merchants and vendors.</p>
<p>If the above cooperation system can be realized, it can be used as a general import collection for retail taxes, which would be a blessing for the people. (Move to help education)</p>

<h3>Health Association Launches Lung Health Check-Up Campaign Free Check-Ups for 10,000 People</h3>
<p>The China Health Association is carrying out the three major goals of medical cost savings, relieving the poor and sick, and social welfare, and is working hard to promote various preventive check-up work. Because lung diseases are extremely rampant in this city, according to the disease statistics reports released by the past Health Departments, lung disease always ranks first, threatening the health of millions of residents in Shanghai, which is extremely serious. In order to combat tuberculosis, the Association has decided to step up tuberculosis prevention work and launch a large-scale lung health check-up campaign starting from today. To increase efficiency, it has specially increased 10,000 free X-ray check-up vouchers, which will be distributed by the following locations.</p>
<p>The entire Shanghai education community will be packaged and distributed by the Social Service Department of the Xinwenbao Newspaper. The entire Shanghai business community will be distributed by the Social Service Department of the Shenbao Newspaper. (A certificate letter is required to obtain the voucher) Doctors give out vouchers to the general poor and sick through the Doctors' Association. Donors will have the vouchers sent to them by the Association for redistribution in order to popularize them. It is hoped that early diagnosis can be popularized to obtain early treatment and restore production capacity as soon as possible, so as not to be trapped by poverty and disease and to achieve the goal of stabilizing society. The number of people in this year's anti-tuberculosis campaign is the highest on record.</p>
<h3>Yao Heqing Hospital Establishes a Free Clinic</h3>
<p>The Yao Heqing Respiratory Hospital sent a letter yesterday saying: Lung disease is extremely harmful, but there are very few good treatments. According to ancient medical books, there is a prescription for Chen Baiguo mustard dew. Ten years ago, I conducted an on-site test and distributed it on a large scale in Ningbo, with obvious results. Later, I suspended it after practicing medicine in Shanghai because it was inconvenient to make it. However, my ambition remains unchanged. Therefore, I entrusted my old friend Mr. Tang to make it in Daishan according to the method. It has been more than three years now. Today, I am grateful to my old friend for transporting part of this dew to Shanghai to benefit patients. Those who suffer from this disease can bring a small bottle to our Association to collect it. Furthermore, someone who has experienced the suffering of past illnesses, from today onwards, a special free clinic will be set up from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM every day. No fees will be charged. The clinic is located at No. 80, Baek Road.</p>
