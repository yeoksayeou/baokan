<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">第二戰綫與英美動向　—莫斯利會議結束後的國際特局— <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>國際時局重心，暫時轉栘到莫斯科的三國會議方面，巳經快半個月了，在會議期中，蘇聯方面始終保持相當平靜的態度，英美方面的言論機關雖在喧擾，實際上不是爲自張目的宣傳，便是不安的猜測而已，所以要把握住會議的重心，頗不容易。現在會議已告結束，倫敦巳經公布了所謂三項重要結果：即設立歐洲諮詢委會，軍事行動半行協定及關於歐洲領土協定。不過與共硏究其表面的宣言，不如觀察其實際行動來得可靠些。我們就會議期問各方面的表示來硏究，可以推想得到這次會議的眞實內容和對於未來局勢的影響。</p>
<p>從三國會議的重心而言，如吾人日前所曾指出的，是蘇美英三國在「從速擊敗德國」的前提之下，商議加强在軍事上政治上經濟上各方面更密切的合作。當然，為了解決這一問題，他們討論的範圍，不能不是非常寬泛的，從目前問題，涉及戰後的問題。可是正因爲如此，蘇美英三國之間是抱着不盡相同的目標與熊度的。蘇聯方面，如其機關報「眞理報」及一消息報」社評所呼籲的，他們只需要解決一個問題，即是如何加强軍事政治與經濟的團結力量以「從速擊敗德國」，但是英美的關係與耍求就複雜得多，他們要提出「戰後」問題，因爲他們怕納粹德國，但是他們史怕赤色的俄國。</p>
<p>然而美國和英國在莫斯科的會議中是不能說幾句嚮亮的話的，因爲在今日歐洲戰爭中，蘇聯有數十乃至近百個軍團的兵力在拼命流血，而美國和英國怎樣呢？美國只有一枝第五軍，英國也只有一枝第八軍。與蘇聯比較，這是怎樣一個比例！美國和英國是沒有兵力了？還是留着作別的用途呢？這是蘇聯方面所惴惴不能自安的。所以，在莫斯科會議中，他們必須把立即開關第二戰綫爲討論中心，其他只是從屬的或是次要的問題。試問赫爾艾登有什麽話可以替華業爾街和唐寗街的大老闆辯護，他們聽到了紅色首都的排砲，得無心驚肉跳？然而不能不强陪笑臉的道賀。邱吉爾在倫敦袛得默默無言，羅斯福雖於日前發表三國會議在「自然的和洽中進行」的談話，稱讚赫兩幾句，對實際又有何用？美英兩國在今後唯一可能的路只有另開一條「第三戰錢」來搪塞一下蘇聯的誅責。</p>
<p>美國參謀總長馬款爾在上月二十一日下院秘密會議席上，據傳會列舉數字與種種事實，屢言蘇聯所求在西歐開　第　戰綫之不可能，參加該秘密會議的就一致表示「蘇聯對於開闢第二戰錢之困難作過小的估計」。這是合衆社傳出的消息，眞僞自難斷言，但美報紛紛刊戰，却是不容輕視的。美英所謂困難的眞實性，自然不待解釋。不過，他們如何能使蘇聯相信，如何在今日搪塞過去而等待所謂維斯福史太林會曦冉來解決，這些都是今日最嚴重的問題。總之，現在情勢已通得美英非展開眞正的第二戰綫不可，在政治工作中一向表示共狡猶之詐的美英，似乎會在東南歐及巴爾幹掀起所謂第二戰錢的替代吧？</p>
<p>確實，美國和英國不僅在國際外交及軍事上遞遇到這樣不易應付的大困難，而且國內的問題也有日趨嚴重之勢。就英國言，維多利亞女皇時代是英國勢力膨脹的頂點，以後即逐漸衰替，前次大戰中雖號稱戰勝國，但是國勢顯已削弱，二，三十年來迄未恢復；孰知又入戰渦。在此次戰爭中，只有依賴美國之支持，自大東買戰事爆發，英美實力又遭致命削弱，英國今後之命運，恐怕求如前次大戰後荷蘭之命運巳不可得！美國目前雖然仍爲龐大的帝國主義國家，但從上月財畏摩根案一百零五億元增稅案之擱淺，已可看出美國財源枯竭之實况，而自本年五月以來爆發的工潮，一波三折，迄未解決，今且愈演愈烈，更可窺見國民生活困苦之程度。那麽，縱使蘇美英二國間暫時不致發生分裂，其今後的作戰實力，也是一大疑問。</p>

<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　新幾內亞方面反軸心軍司令樸萊米，最近曾承認日軍抵抗堅强，據渠談其情形稱：余深信日軍爲防衛新幾內亞佔領地起見，雖尺寸之地，亦必死守不讓，現日軍之戰力，已日趨强大，並不斷强化陣地，日軍並無退却之模樣，其必將作戰到底，故反袖心軍在芬希哈罕作戰，將更趨困難，同時吾人亦不能認爲該方面之戰事業已結束。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　據西南太平洋方面某基地電，敵機（B24）型轟炸機四架，十一月一日深夜二次來襲西里伯島普尼灣沿岸波馬拉地區，日海軍戰鬥機隊即將其擊退。又敵雙發戰鬥機及北美（B24）　機等十一架、二日晨來襲亞拉佛拉海阿盧羣島東方之托拉千地區，亦經日海軍戰鬥機隊猛烈迎擊，常將其擊落一架，其他二架受創遞去。</p>

<p>東京四日中央社電　在全世界注視中舉行之莫斯科三國會談，蘇聯終於三國間佔完全主動之立塲，此在共同宣言及共同公報中，己完全暴露，英美尤共是美國，今後途陷於自縛之苦境。美國全國煤礦罷工以及明年大總統選舉等內在的困難，益形擴大。二年前折徇日·美交涉之日本特派大使來栖三耶氏，於此囘憧彼於二年前之此時，負重大使命，圖以平和手段打開日、笑難局，由東京出發，乘機橫斷太平洋赴華盛頓之當時情景，特於四日在外務省接見記者，表明見解，大旨餵：最近世界大勢，以前次歡戰結束後卞年問變化最大，（一九二〇年至一九三〇年），其後十年內（一九二〇）年以後），乃僅爲前十年間歷史之廷長而已，蓋自一九二〇年至三〇年之十年內，美前總統威爾遜之理想主義十四條，其要者爲現實的利己主義，所謂媾和條約國際聯盟，爲壓迫德國之工具，使德國陷入今日之現狀。又從東亞而言，美國在巴黎和平會議席上，早已開始攻擊日本，關後舉行華盛頓會議，美名担常維持東亞和平，以至今日，此不僅破壞日。英同盟及石井·蘭辛協定，且巧妙利用中國，燭動排日運動，以對付日本，故日本過去遵守華盛頓條約精神之協調外交方針，遂不得已而放棄。此時英國亦曾謀利用美國，擁護其在東亞之自身地位與權益，故此後美國於一九二七年制定移民法時，即列日本人爲劣等人，種考一九二〇至三〇年十年開之世界情勢，即知三〇年以後事態發生之原因，實起源於前十年間。蓋美國從其建國傳統上言，其與國際間發生關係爲時不遠，從其國家之立傷上言，美國實爲一理想主義之國家，其理想主義在大戰後舉行之凡爾賽會議時，曾遭蹂躝，此在美前總統胡佛之所著（美第一次十字軍）一書中已論及之、此次大戰美國所主張者，給完全抹殺威爾遜理想主義及美國傳統之理想主義。但余以爲笑國此舉實受指導者制霸世昇之帝國主義野心及英國策謀所致，余認彼等必將有覺　之一日，余前曾指資美國，雖言尊重中國主權，但移民法仍未見改正”最近美政府曾要求議會改正移民法，但已國常菲律賓宣言獨立之際提出准許菲律賓獨立，彼此舉一方面係受日本大束亞戰爭進行之影饗，另一方面可知其重視菲律賓在軍事上之價値，蓋美國自此次戰爭勃發以來，曾議論應永久領有菲律賓，以此為東亞軍事根據地，泰田格斯爲抑制此項議論，特提出菲律賓　獨立案。至英國並無意在英　領故正華僑排斥法，然吾人不論英、美作任何策謀，吾人唯有以正義從事解放大東亞民族，建設大東亞共榮久和平。</p>
<h3 id="c4">合衆社長承認　對日作戰困難 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>阿根廷京城四日中央社電　據芝加哥合衆社長具里，曾於二日在芝加哥演講說明對日作戰之困難，要旨如次：反軸心國今後作戰將益感困難，蓋吾人今後必須對日德兩國展開陸上戰故也。又縱對德戰爭終了後，與日本亦必展開另一戰鬥，美國於大平洋作戰前途有何障礙，笑國民對此多無充分認識。爲對此有所認識，須將太平洋之情形與歐洲戰爭作比較，蓋歐洲方面英距德本土僅三百英里，彼處可供吾人作戰之理想基地，况英國並有誇稱世界之海運設施，反之，吾人於太平洋方面作戰，迄今殆未予日本以何等祖害。又美國之轟炸機爲空襲日本，必須飛翔一千乃至三千英里之距離，且於太平洋及亞洲之軍事設施極爲貧弱，因此反軸心軍之補給問題，遂讀逢極大困難。總之，擠太平洋作攻擊戰，較歐洲戰域倍加困難。</p>

<p>柏林四日中央社電　德國新聞社訉：星期二日戈美爾區與尼維爾區之戰事雖更形活躍，但廣大之戰爭僅在東綫南部繼續進行。在諾蓋草原與克里米亞半島之北部通路。德軍向前挺進，與隣近部隊取得聯絡，因而加深共防綫。敵向德軍障礙陣地之進攻，在各據點均被擊退。同時德軍在克里伏洛格區大規模之戰爭結果，獲得更前之進展，而同時蘇軍由彼里耶斯拉夫橋頭堡之突圍，則未能有所進展，德坦克車楔形隊善於利用所得之地域，在激戰之過程中，過去數日間緊擠於該區之蘇軍殘部被切斷歸路而完全就殘，敵援軍由後方趕至發動解救之攻勢，結果雙方展開猛烈之坦克車大戰，當時蘇坦克車二十三輛被擊至不能行動。此一戰役中，德軍坦克車一分隊報告擒獲蘇軍戰俘五千二百名，該分隊並擊毀敵坦克車四百四十二輛。大砲一百二十一尊。平射砲六百六十三尊。機關槍三百六十五挺。汽車三百四十二輛。以及大批其他種類之武器子彈與戰具，同時並擊落蘇機三十五架，其中幾全為斯托摩維克型。</p>

<p>東京四日中央社電　雲南前綫某基地四日電，怒江以西之渝軍，於日軍此次進攻雲南作戰之諸戰中，已完全暴露其戰力之極度低劣，與戰意之沮喪。在印之英　軍隊，對於渝軍之戰力，前會極為重視，故乃企圖與渝軍東西呼應，奪囘緬甸。但觀渝軍不堪一擊之情形，已不得不對共反攻計劃，重加檢討。茲據被俘渝軍中尉陳文麟等三人所談之「渝這內幕」如次：第卅六師，前會出動於　蘇戰區山東方面之第一綫，然因日軍之攻擊，蒙受重創，人員裝備，因以减半。後与後方部队换防，開往重慶成都方面，積極整備之後，去年編入陳誠部下，移駐雲南。今年二月，因預備第二師在怒江西岸地區遭日軍打擊甚衆，第三十六師，途成為雲南方面之最强部隊，繼預備第二師之後，渡過怒江，担任前衛防務。然多數將兵，因會與日軍相戰，深悉日軍之精强，故對日軍多有畏心，將士戰意愈顯沮喪，故無勝利感之獲得。現在渝軍中逃亡者日衆，內部摩擦亦甚劇烈。逃兵多時，一團中一月達六十三名，平均亦不下四五十名。補逃兵之空位者，即為强徵來之平民，故士兵　　低下，實所必然。因薪餉不足，時有掠奪事件，兵士藉抗戰之美名，掠奪民羊食糧及雜物等事，殆已習以為當。又渝軍內羅　疾者頗多，平均一連每月因此病死才晃下十名，因缺乏金　納霜，故症重者，除臥以待斃外，別無他法。此外患皮　病者，呼吸病者，痢疾才者尤多。因醫術幼稚，藥品缺乏，患者之苦，不堪言然。兵土之消遺，即為賭博而已。</p>

<p>以民衆為作戰的盾牌</p>
<p>太岳地區的民衆，都是屬於農民救國會，婦女救國會，商人救國會，青年救國會等，驅使他們把對日作戰當作一種義務。他們的任務是農民救國會從事食糧增產，婦婦救國會製造軍需品，商人救國會從治安地區購人物資，青年救國會把從十五歲到二十五歲的青年分班担任警備。</p>
<p>雖然如此，但物資的不足年　深刻，共軍的裝配，極為　弱，在資上也極低下。一方面民衆生活也極困頓，僅止於糊口，壓戰空氣漸見濃厚，物價　漲無底，比治安地區貴數倍以上，最近的物價例如火柴一合三元，烟草一袋十二元，粗布一尺七元，牛一頭二千元。（均以太岳地區通用的軍票計。）</p>
<p>東縛民衆的酷刑</p>
<p>·雖在這種狀態之下，民衆不許口出不平，農作物及其他一切生產，均强施比例制。萬一不到規定的數額時，視情節如何而加以苛酷的刑　，民衆在共軍之前，除默然順從以外，別無生存之道。</p>
<p>堅壁清野的退避點戰術，並不是中共的指導力滲透其見，乃是恐怕在漢奸之名下受刑罰。而物的隱匿，並不是為了防日軍的利用，而防共軍的微發，乃逃避而隱藏於石壁中。這種種情形，足見民衆共軍並不心服，無地可逃的苦情。（翔：譯自十朋廿七日西部朝日新聞。）</p>

<p>來　　間之日本「知性代表」名作家豐島氏，於民國二十九年辦華，，立於上海煩重街頭之一隅，對於華中情形譬加以極深刻之批評，此次對於三年以後，極度變動之上海情形及新中國之姿態，不　驚呼「一概非常緊張」，而其所發表之談話中則謂：「在國內對於上海物價之高，徵有所聞，但陳列之價目表實堪驚人；昨日曾在四川路飲黃酒三杯，並通小盆菜肴，取費二百元，着欲稍飲一些或稍食一些，開須自五百元起，價値之高，非始料所及，在滬日人生活方法不知如何？」豐島氏又謂：「雖與國內同樣採取憑票購買制，但上海物產豐富，憑票購買制之運用，是否有感到困難？」若謂未言變動之物，當為上海之大　滋味。」這最後一句話，是更夠幽默了。</p>
<p>豐島氏對於上海物價高漲之程度，尚不過以代價三五百元之酒肴爲一時測量之標準，若親眼目睹千元以至數千元之所謂「節約宴席」，萬元以至數萬元之所謂「國貨大衣」，恐其驚異程度，又要增加不知幾許倍了！他因爲上海物產豐富，反而懷疑於憑票購買制之運用，可以想見其透視力的銳敏，我們的解應是：物屋豐富而不能統制收貝，則憑票可買，不憑票亦可買，黑市即永無消除之一日。我們對於「惟有蟹味未曾變動」一句話，自覺「口之於味，有同嗜焉」，可是，以洋澄湖大蟹的價格而言，祇怕此蟹祗應殷富晱，平民那得幾同嘗？上海的戰時經濟狀態，便是如此，一面是因戰爭而致富的少數者，不惜揮金如土，一面是因戰爭而陷於貴乏與困苦的最大多數者，甚至家無一日之糧！</p>

<p>德富蘇峰本多態太郎對談　　（續十月廿九日）</p>
<p>德富　本多先生也曾說。美國和英國，他們的想法完全不同。英國可說遇到了趁火打擊的强盜，而那强盜就是美國。美國的想法，無論從那一方面說來，一面想奪佔英國的財產，所以得寸進　的一步步踏通英國的窠穴，漸漸的把本家拆散搶過來，一面又日夜苦　魚　地想打州日本。</p>
<p>本多　他們着了　　洲的認。</p>
<p>德富　所以羅斯福那人恐怕是世界第一個投機家，說大話者，像他那樣無責任的政治家，自有世界歷史以來所未有。我曾費了很多的時間研究歷史，據我所知，沒有像他那樣無實任的政治家。羅斯福的前輩就知道責任。他們知道沒有德國的陸軍和英國的海軍不能從中國趕出日本。但現在的羅斯福他不願這一切，袛知道向前。如其說這是勇氣，那是匹夫之勇，是賭博的勇氣。一萬幾千萬的美國人爲了總斯福的野心而作戰。實是可哀。我以爲美國的破綻也在勞　間題上，一千萬人的勞動問題的不平，今後將愈　重大，而在食糧間題上，從日趨困寐的農業方面發生破總，也是非常明白的事情。又在生活上，我以爲美國人到底不能忍受這種生活至五年七年之久。日本人和美國人的生活狀態，完全不同，我們縱使沒有汽車，但可以用步行到任何地方。他們曾速一般人都有汽車代步，所以這種狀態如長此繼續下去，在他們是非常苦的，袛有日本可以這樣倣。所以在今日如有人想對英美沒有方法，我就當他是國賊。</p>
<p>本多　正如先生所說，說對英美沒方法的人，直到現在還幸而不曾遇到。常聽得有人說，「德蘇之間不會有什麽變動嗎？」聽到這種話。我是從事外交工作的人，你的意見如何？有人說，武力不到的地方，用外交來補充，在外交上是沒有那種質術的力量的。先用武力得到百分之八十的戰果之後，外交才能成功。現在英美方面常放德蘇單獨購和說的空氣，那是因爲不知道蘇　在三國會曦中將出以何顴態度，故放此探測氣球。他們都担心萬一悄　不利，蘇聯隨時有營奴的可能。所以這一次他們探測蘇聯究竟會不會這樣。</p>
<p>徒常　想來，蘇聯此次的出席三國會議，即從日本報紙的電報上也可以推測，蘇　方面先想處置　羅的海三國，芬蘭，巴實幹，貝　拉比亞勢地。而所謂波蘭者，大約係指一九三九年的國境綫之東的東波關吧，一方面在地中海委員會中，有史太林的心腹外交次官維興期基氏參加，特戈爾做權方面也派有　權公使，對地中海間　漸趨積極。因此，所以蘇聯的態度很爲可疑。而很有許多人疑心德軍退到聶伯河之錢將和蘇聯講和，可是英美事事仰蘇聯鼻息，處處讓　，而蘇聯和德國之間，竟會購和，縱在常織上想來也不致於的。反之，希特勒曾說，縮小東部戰綫者，乃檢討歐洲要寗之整個局面後的有計劃的撇推，乃爲了取更　的攻勢之準備。事實上，東部戰綫縱有出入，尚保有三百個師的兵力。所遣於巴爾幹及義大利者，僅其一部而已。且戰况儘管有所變動，希特勒，史太林對民衆的把握力，一點也沒有動搖，所以不會有中途握手的可能。總之道也無非是出於英美的猜疑以宜傳策略的暗影而已。</p>
<p>中國的情形，如先土所說，日本對英美漸獲勝利之後，渝方自然解散，所以全面和平等傳說，我以爲也不過是重度方面的宣傳。（待續）（翔：自十月二十日東部每日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c56">戰時房屋租賃法第七條的商榷 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 陳伯民</p>
<p>在此非常時期，爲業主與（房客以及第三權利者—三房客—間之常有糾紛發生，故而賢明的常局，在本年五月間，有戰事時期之房局租賃特別法的頒布，內容對於房　賓主之間有租賃期限之合同契約，無形與以取悄，人民居住問題上得到保障不少。</p>
<p>事業上歷來房東對於房客有期限性合同上的約束，給與打擊，是不爲過的，如此一來，確實减少了不少的糾紛，但是特別法中第七條，大有商權之必要，內容記得大約是：「業主除負擔一切費用之一外，有應得之利潤，」此一條例一經公布，比較狡猾的業主隨即紛紛增祖在前，餘之亦效尤在後，甚則有依照原租金　口加至多及十數　者，振振有詞，以特別法作爲護身符，遜仃訴訟時，法官亦言爲之基，不啻與（虎添翼，弱小居民，豈有反抗餘力，何能再作緘默。</p>
<p>蓋有戰時期內物資缺之，只是公認的，木料磚瓦，遞泓無已，亦是事貴，新建一所房屋，當然造價奇昻，故而有小費押租等，種種　相的索取，假使以舊右之房產，故意邀同建築工程師來估高價値，以拆總來論獲利，藉口作爲加租的嬰挾，總有些不妥吧。</p>
<p>在靖平時期，人們的有房產，不過是產業而已，在戰時的物價飛漲，常然有其種種的原因，但是以游資無歸的一班大資本家，爲保全幣値間題，穩而可靠，乃投資於房地產之間，豈知衆望所歸，反將房地產價値抬高，以致飛漲不已。一般利慾薾心之徒以爲恭利可獲，只才常作生意經般的，今日踢皮球，明日搶帽子，置民生居住間題於不顯，繼之糾紛亦疊出無窮，當局乃頒布租貨特別法來制止房東房客間的掙扎，前租界行政當局，雖有房租調解姿員會的專爲房束房客雙方服務，然而情形複雜，除非雙方百相諒解，決難有調解的可能。</p>
<p>有云，房東之房租以物價而論，低落損失過鉅，此常然一致公認，房租確屬目前最低的數目，酌量加租，以補損失，常然名正言順，若一定斤斤乎以物價相追，或以租賃特一別法第七條作根據，加足十數倍或數倍，當此國府正在安定民生之際，糧政政善，日用品配給之時，豈容有產者之隨心所欲，以買房產—民生居住問題—視同經商般之獲利，且房　究屬產業而已，滄桑易變，能保得子孫之永久乎。</p>
<p>曾記得徐勿齊先生有云：「置產者喫虧三分，便享用十分，徵租者，少收一合，便多收幾年。」此非故意言出題外，欲知房產價値之抬高，當以所有產業價値增多以自慰，豈可以在此物資偏偏缺乏時期，硬以拆剝舊料造新之價値相比較，综觀全市，租金相加，其動輒數倍者，大不乏人，其蠢蠢然欲動者，亦相繼不少，筆者自身經歷，猶似冬日飲冰，點點在心，故而拉雜以談，戰時租賃特別法之第七條，是否有商討之價值，深願談者，與以響應，是乃民生之幸。</p>

        <h1>1943.11.05</h1>
<h3 id="e1">The Second Front and the Trends of Britain and America – The Special International Situation After the Mosley Conference <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The focus of the international situation has temporarily shifted to the Tripartite Conference in Moscow, which has already been underway for almost half a month. Throughout the conference, the Soviet Union has consistently maintained a relatively calm attitude. Although the media outlets of Britain and America have been making a lot of noise, it has primarily been either self-aggrandizing propaganda or uneasy speculation. Therefore, grasping the central point of the conference is quite difficult. Now that the conference has concluded, London has announced what it calls three important results: the establishment of a European Advisory Commission, a military action agreement, and an agreement on European territories. However, rather than merely studying the superficial declarations, it is more reliable to observe their actual actions. By examining the expressions from all sides during the conference, we can infer the true content of this conference and its impact on the future situation.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of the Tripartite Conference’s focus, as we pointed out some time ago, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, under the premise of "defeating Germany as quickly as possible," discussed strengthening closer cooperation in military, political, and economic aspects. Of course, in order to resolve this issue, the scope of their discussions could not be anything but very broad, ranging from current problems to postwar issues. However, precisely because of this, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain held quite different goals and attitudes. The Soviet Union, as called for in editorials in its official newspaper "Pravda" and "Izvestia," only needed to solve one problem, which was how to strengthen military, political, and economic solidarity to "defeat Germany as quickly as possible." However, the relationship and demands of Britain and America were much more complex. They wanted to raise "postwar" issues because they feared Nazi Germany, but they also feared red Russia.</p>
<p>However, the United States and Britain could not say many loud words at the Moscow conference because, in today's European war, the Soviet Union has dozens or even nearly a hundred army corps bleeding and fighting desperately. What about the United States and Britain? The United States has only one Fifth Army, and Britain has only one Eighth Army. Compared to the Soviet Union, what a ratio this is! Do the United States and Britain lack troops, or are they keeping them for other purposes? This is what the Soviet side is uneasily worrying about. Therefore, in the Moscow conference, they had to make opening a second front immediately the center of discussion, and other issues were only subordinate or secondary. What could Hull and Eden say to defend the big bosses on Wall Street and Downing Street? Did they not feel their hearts pound with fear when they heard the artillery fire from the red capital? Yet, they had to force a smile and offer congratulations. Churchill could only remain silent in London. Although Roosevelt made a statement a few days ago saying that the Tripartite Conference was "proceeding in a natural and harmonious manner" and praised Hull a few times, what practical use did it have? The only possible path for the United States and Britain in the future is to open another "third front" to brush off the accusations from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It is said that at a secret meeting of the House of Commons on the 21st of last month, U.S. Chief of Staff Marshall listed figures and various facts, repeatedly stating the impossibility of the Soviet Union's request to open a second front in Western Europe. All those who participated in the secret meeting unanimously stated that "the Soviet Union has underestimated the difficulty of opening a second front." This is a message from the Associated Press, and its authenticity is difficult to determine, but it cannot be ignored that American newspapers are publishing articles about it one after another. The reality of the so-called difficulties of the United States and Britain naturally does not need to be explained. However, how they can make the Soviet Union believe, how they can brush it off today while waiting for the so-called Welles-Stalin meeting to resolve it—these are the most serious problems today. In short, the current situation has forced the United States and Britain to launch a real second front. Would the United States and Britain, who have always shown themselves to be cunning in political work, stir up a so-called substitute for the second front in Southeastern Europe and the Balkans?</p>
<p>Indeed, the United States and Britain not only encounter such difficult-to-deal-with major difficulties in international diplomacy and military affairs, but also their domestic problems are increasingly serious. As far as Britain is concerned, the Victorian era was the peak of British power, after which it gradually declined. Although it claimed to be a victorious nation in the last World War, its national power was clearly weakened, and it has not recovered in the two or three decades since then. Who knew it would enter the vortex of war again. In this war, it can only rely on the support of the United States. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the strength of Britain and America has suffered a fatal weakening. The fate of Britain in the future, I am afraid, cannot even achieve the fate of the Netherlands after the last World War! Although the United States is still a huge imperialist country, the shelving of the $10.5 billion tax increase bill proposed by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau last month shows the reality of the exhaustion of American financial resources. Moreover, the labor strikes that have erupted since May of this year, with their twists and turns, have not yet been resolved and are now intensifying, further revealing the extent of the hardship in national life. Then, even if the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain do not temporarily split, their future combat strength is also a big question.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch)—Anti-Axis commander in New Guinea, Blamey, recently admitted that the Japanese resistance is strong. According to his account of the situation: "I deeply believe that for the sake of defending their occupied territories in New Guinea, the Japanese military will defend every inch of land to the death. The combat strength of the Japanese military is increasing daily and they are constantly strengthening their positions. The Japanese military shows no sign of retreating, and they will fight to the end. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces' operations in Finschhafen will become more difficult. At the same time, we cannot consider the operations in that area to be over."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch)—According to a dispatch from a certain base in the Southwest Pacific, four enemy aircraft (B-24 type bombers) attacked the Pomala area along the Punai Bay coast of Celebes Island twice late at night on November 1st. The Japanese naval fighter squadron immediately repelled them. Furthermore, eleven enemy twin-engine fighters and North American (B-24) aircraft attacked the Torachan area east of the Aru Islands in the Arafura Sea on the morning of the 2nd. They were also fiercely intercepted by the Japanese naval fighter squadron, which shot down one aircraft and damaged two others, forcing them to flee.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Mr. Kurusu Saburo Gave a Speech Yesterday, Aiming to Liberate the East Asian Nations with Justice <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch)—At the Moscow Tripartite Conference, which is being watched around the world, the Soviet Union finally took the completely initiative among the three countries. This has been fully exposed in the joint declaration and joint communique. Britain, and especially the United States, will fall into a situation of self-inflicted suffering in the future. Internal difficulties such as the nationwide coal mine strike in the United States and next year's presidential election are expanding. Mr. Kurusu Saburo, the Japanese special envoy who negotiated with the United States two years ago, was filled with emotion as he recalled the scene of departing from Tokyo to cross the Pacific to Washington at this time two years ago, bearing a major mission to open up the difficult situation between Japan and the United States through peaceful means. He met with reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 4th to express his views, the gist of which is as follows: "The recent world situation has changed the most in the ten years after the end of the last World War (1920 to 1930). The following ten years (after 1920) were only an extension of the history of the previous ten years. The idealist Fourteen Points of U.S. President Wilson during the decade from 1920 to 1930, the main content of which was realistic egoism, the so-called peace treaty and the League of Nations, were tools to oppress Germany, causing Germany to fall into its present situation. Moreover, from the perspective of East Asia, the United States had already begun to attack Japan at the Paris Peace Conference, and then held the Washington Conference, nominally maintaining peace in East Asia, until today. This not only destroyed the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and the Ishii-Lansing Agreement, but also cleverly used China to instigate anti-Japanese movements to deal with Japan. Therefore, Japan's past policy of coordination and diplomacy in accordance with the spirit of the Washington Treaty was forced to be abandoned. At this time, Britain also sought to use the United States to protect its own position and interests in East Asia. Therefore, when the United States enacted the Immigration Act in 1927, it listed Japanese people as inferior people. Knowing the world situation in the decade from 1920 to 1930, we can know the cause of the events that occurred after the 1930s, which originated in the previous ten years. From the perspective of its founding tradition, the United States has not been involved in international relations for a long time. From the perspective of its national position, the United States is indeed an idealist country. Its idealism was trampled on at the Versailles Conference held after the World War. This has been discussed in former U.S. President Hoover's book (America's First Crusade). What the United States advocates in this war completely erases Wilsonian idealism and the traditional idealism of the United States. However, I believe that this move by the United States is caused by the imperialist ambitions of those in power to dominate the world and the schemes of Britain. I believe that they will have a day of realization. I have previously pointed out that although the United States says it respects Chinese sovereignty, the Immigration Act has not been amended." Recently, the U.S. government requested Congress to amend the Immigration Act, but when the Philippines declared independence, it proposed allowing the Philippines to be independent. On the one hand, this was influenced by Japan's Greater East Asia War, and on the other hand, it shows that it attaches importance to the military value of the Philippines. Since the outbreak of this war, the United States has discussed permanently possessing the Philippines as a military base in East Asia. Tydings proposed the Philippine independence bill to suppress this discussion. As for Britain, it has no intention of expelling overseas Chinese in British territories, but no matter what schemes Britain and the United States make, we can only use justice to liberate the East Asian nations and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere for permanent peace.</p>
<h3 id="e4">President of the Associated Press Admits the Difficulty of Fighting Against Japan <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch)—According to Gill, the president of the Chicago Associated Press, who gave a speech in Chicago on the 2nd explaining the difficulty of fighting against Japan, the main points are as follows: "The anti-Axis countries will feel more and more difficult in their future operations, because we must launch land warfare against both Germany and Japan in the future. Even after the war against Germany ends, we must also launch another battle with Japan. The American people do not have a sufficient understanding of what obstacles the United States faces in the Pacific War. To understand this, we must compare the situation in the Pacific with the European war. In Europe, Britain is only 300 miles away from the German mainland, and there are ideal bases for us to operate. Moreover, Britain has world-renowned maritime transportation facilities. On the contrary, in the Pacific War, we have hardly caused any harm to Japan so far. Moreover, American bombers must fly a distance of one thousand to three thousand miles to bomb Japan, and the military facilities in the Pacific and Asia are extremely poor. Therefore, the supply problem of the anti-Axis forces is extremely difficult. In short, launching an offensive war in the Pacific is twice as difficult as in the European theater."</p>

Now, all the countries and nations in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere have broken away from the many years of bondage of Britain and the United States, adding a new page to the history of building Greater East Asia. At this time, in order to completely defeat Britain and the United States and complete the war objectives, it is necessary for the one billion people of Greater East Asia to unite firmly. Premier Tojo of Japan, in view of this situation, has repeatedly explained Japan's specific construction policies and emphasized the necessity of unity at the 83rd Extraordinary Session of the Diet. The House of Representatives of Japan also proposed a "Resolution on the Total Mobilization of Greater East Asia," which was unanimously passed by the entire chamber, further promoting national unity. It was decided to hold the National Congress of Japan for the Solidarity of Greater East Asia at the Hibiya Public Park Grand Square in Tokyo at 10 am on the 7th, so that the 100 million people of Japan will be more invigorated and advance the cause of reviving Asia.

<h3 id="e9">Fierce Battles Between German and Soviet Forces in the Crimea Isthmus; Soviet Forces Establish a Bridgehead North of Kerch <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch)—German News Agency dispatch, military intelligence: Yesterday, under the cover of the air force and heavy artillery, Soviet forces launched offensives to the south and west north of Kerch. German forces intercepted the enemy and tried to stop their advance. Fierce battles are still in progress. The German forces in Crimea are fiercely attacking the enemy forces that landed south of Kerch, further reducing their area of activity. Soviet forces have established a new bridgehead north of Kerch. Near the isthmus north of Crimea, in the Berlekov area, German forces destroyed 20 enemy tanks in yesterday's fierce battle.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch)—Hai Tong Agency dispatch: On Wednesday, the fighting on the Kerch Peninsula greatly reduced the Soviet landing area, but fierce fighting is still in progress. On the Nogai Steppe, Soviet forces are increasing their pressure on the German defenses in the Nikopol and Kherson areas. Powerful Soviet counterattacks have surrounded several Soviet teams, but the surrounded Soviet forces are still fighting like trapped beasts. Soviet forces are reinforcing with a large number of tanks, so tanks are active again on the battlefield. According to the current development, the extent of the impact of the battle in the Dnieper bend on the adjacent areas cannot yet be predicted, but the results of the great battle on the southern route of the Eastern Front will be generally seen after the weekend.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Large Tank Battle in Krivoy Rog <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch)—German News Agency dispatch: Although the fighting in the Gomel and Nevel districts was more active on Tuesday, the large-scale war continued only on the southern part of the Eastern Front. On the Nogai Steppe and the northern passage of the Crimean Peninsula, German forces advanced and made contact with neighboring units, thereby deepening their defense line. The enemy's attacks on the German obstacles were repelled in various strongholds. At the same time, the large-scale war in the Krivoy Rog area resulted in more forward progress for the German forces, while the Soviet forces' breakout from the Peryeslav bridgehead failed to make any progress. The German tank wedge formation made good use of the acquired area. During the fierce fighting process, the remaining Soviet troops who had been squeezed into the area for the past few days were cut off and completely annihilated. Enemy reinforcements rushed from the rear to launch a rescue offensive, resulting in a fierce tank battle between the two sides. At that time, 23 Soviet tanks were destroyed. In this battle, a German tank detachment reported capturing 5,200 Soviet prisoners of war. The detachment also destroyed 442 enemy tanks, 121 artillery pieces, 663 flat-trajectory guns, 365 machine guns, 342 vehicles, and a large number of other types of weapons, ammunition, and war equipment. At the same time, 35 Soviet aircraft were shot down, almost all of which were Stormovik types.</p>
<p>German Aircraft Active on the Kiev Front</p>
<p>In the central Dnieper River area, Soviet forces once again attempted to expand their base in the Dnieper River bend southeast of Kiev, resulting in only slight progress in their positions in a few places, at the cost of heavy sacrifices in manpower and materials. North of Kiev, German main aircraft and Stuka aircraft dispersed the deployment of large enemy infantry units and carried out nighttime attacks on enemy supply lines, troop encampments, highways, and railway traffic. After several days of fighting in the Gomel district, the German defenses have been greatly strengthened. Repeated attempts by Soviet forces to recover lost ground have been unsuccessful. There are no important war reports from other areas in the central region. There is only artillery and commando activity on both sides. Northwest of Velikiye Luki, the enemy took advantage of heavy fog to enter the German lines, but the German defenders responded with a fierce counterattack, preventing the Soviet forces from taking coordinated action. Indecisive battles occurred at other strongholds. But in general, the German High Command has consistently prevented the enemy's attempts to break through.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch)—According to Chongqing broadcast, a Japanese air force fleet raided Jian'ou, Fujian Province, a forward base of the US Air Force, at 9:30 am on the 2nd, bombing various facilities at the airfield.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch)—The Japanese Governor-General's Office in occupied Hong Kong announced on the 4th that at about 3 pm and 4 pm on the 3rd, US Air Force stationed in Chongqing attempted to attack Hong Kong with more than 20 aircraft in two waves. The Japanese aircraft took off immediately to intercept them. The encounters with enemy aircraft occurred in the air near Humen and over the Pearl River banks northwest of Guangzhou. After an engagement, the enemy aircraft sustained serious damage and retreated to the north and west.</p>
<h3 id="e12">West of the Nu River, Chongqing Army's Combat Strength Is Poor; Captured Lieutenant Talks About the "Inside Story of the Chongqing Army" <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch)—A dispatch from a certain base on the Yunnan front on the 4th stated that the Chongqing Army west of the Nu River has completely exposed its extremely poor combat strength and demoralized morale in the various battles of the Japanese military's recent Yunnan campaign. The British troops in India once highly valued the combat strength of the Chongqing Army, so they attempted to coordinate with the Chongqing Army to retake Burma. However, seeing the situation where the Chongqing Army was easily defeated, they had no choice but to re-examine their counter-offensive plan. According to the "Inside Story of the Chongqing Army" talked about by captured Chongqing Army Lieutenant Chen Wenlin and others: "The 36th Division once deployed to the front line in the Shandong area of the Suqian war zone, but suffered heavy losses due to the attacks of the Japanese military, and its personnel and equipment were reduced by half as a result. Later, after being replaced by rear troops, it went to the Chongqing and Chengdu areas for active reorganization. Last year, it was incorporated under the command of Chen Cheng and transferred to Yunnan. In February of this year, because the 2nd Reserve Division suffered heavy blows from the Japanese military in the area west of the Nu River, the 36th Division became the strongest unit in Yunnan, and after the 2nd Reserve Division, it crossed the Nu River and assumed forward defense duties. However, most of the officers and soldiers had fought against the Japanese military and knew well the strength of the Japanese military, so they had a great fear of the Japanese military, and the morale of the officers and soldiers was even more demoralized, so there was no sense of victory. Now there are more and more deserters in the Chongqing Army, and internal friction is also very severe. At times when there are many deserters, one regiment can have as many as 63 deserters in a month, and on average, there are no fewer than 40 or 50. The vacancies left by deserters are filled by civilians who are forcibly conscripted, so it is inevitable that the quality of the soldiers will be low. Because of insufficient pay, looting incidents occur from time to time. Soldiers take advantage of the good name of resisting the war to plunder civilian sheep, food, and miscellaneous items, which has become commonplace. Moreover, there are many soldiers in the Chongqing Army suffering from malaria. On average, one company has less than 10 soldiers who die from this disease each month. Because of the lack of quinine, there is no other way for those with severe symptoms except to lie down and wait for death. In addition, there are many soldiers suffering from skin diseases, respiratory diseases, and dysentery. Because of the rudimentary medical skills and the lack of medicines, the suffering of the patients is indescribable. The only pastime for the soldiers is gambling."</p>
<h3 id="e13">Captured Female Operative Discusses Inside Story of the Chinese Communists <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Beiping, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese army in North China, the Chinese Communist army in the Taiyue Military Region is now nearing its end, after being thoroughly suppressed by the elite Japanese forces. On October 12th, a reporter interviewed Wang Junying, a female operative of the Chinese Communist army captured by the Japanese army, to inquire about the inside story of the Chinese Communist Party. The following is a record of the conversation between her and the reporter:</p>
<p>(Question) Why did you join the Communist Party?</p>
<p>(Answer) After dropping out of Beiping Normal University, I responded to a recruitment by a certain staff officer of Yan Xishan's army and went to Shanxi to engage in women's work within the military. In February of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), when friction arose between the Shanxi army and the Communist army, I was ordered by Yan Xishan to establish a school in Qin County. Subsequently, I gradually joined the women's work of the Eighth Route Army of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the Communist Party's anti-Japanese education like?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Communist Party never lets people know about their hypocritical policies. However, the Communist cadres are well aware that the peoples of East Asia are now uniting and working hard to build the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and that the people under the rule of the National Government can also live and work in peace. However, they still distort the new situation in East Asia and use cruel means to drive ignorant people to continue the war of resistance.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the anti-war consciousness in the Communist-held areas?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Chinese Communists, amidst contradictions and fallacies, openly commit all kinds of tyrannical acts under the pretext of resisting Japan. If anyone violates the Communist anti-Japanese policy, they are labeled as traitors. Out of fear, the people have no choice but to follow their actions when the opportunity arises. Once I fell into the Communist trap, I fear that I would find it difficult to extricate myself with my own strength.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the recent situation in the Taiyue Military Region?</p>
<p>(Answer) Since this year, the situation in the Taiyue Military Region has deteriorated. In particular, the friction between the Shanxi military doctors and the direct line troops of the Chongqing government has expanded, and anti-communist operations have been launched in various places. Moreover, food is extremely scarce, and this has finally led to the implementation of food regulations. Other incidents, such as civil servants acting savagely and violently, wasting public funds, and military discipline being disrupted, are constantly emerging, creating an era of panic.</p>
<p>(Question) What is your opinion on the current situation?</p>
<p>(Answer) I understand Japan's true intention is to liberate the peoples of East Asia and seek the happiness of the Chinese people. I have now deeply realized my past mistakes after the war. Therefore, I believe that the Chinese Communists and Chiang Kai-shek's Chongqing government, who are being manipulated by the evil hands of Britain and the United States and are grinding against each other, will soon collapse.</p>

<p>Argentine Capital, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Washington, the general coal strike in the eastern United States was expected to lead to unusual disputes due to the strong attitude of the striking miners, but it took a sudden turn for the better and was satisfactorily resolved on the afternoon of the 3rd, at the expiration of Roosevelt's order to resume work. Fuel Administrator Ickes has established a new wage contract, and Lewis immediately telegraphed the striking workers to return to work. Although the content of the new wage contract is not yet clear, it appears that the miners' wages have been increased by $1.50.</p>
<p>Amsterdam, 4th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency quoted a Washington dispatch as saying that the US Miners' Union has announced that it has reached an unsatisfactory understanding with the government, which will take effect immediately and cannot be changed during the government's management of mining power. The understanding stipulates a daily wage of $8.50. Union President Lewis has ordered 530,000 striking miners to return to work on Wednesday night. The union has also reached another understanding with the Federal Mediation Court, which is to reduce the morning break from 30 minutes to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – Since the national coal miners in Australia began their strike in the middle of October, the Australian government has had no countermeasures. According to a dispatch from Canberra, Australian Attorney General Evatt announced on the 3rd that the government will take tough measures against the striking workers, and declared that the strikers must give up their status as miners and be fined heavily by the government.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from London, as the Greater East Asia War progresses, the shortage of materials in Australia is becoming increasingly acute. The Daily Telegraph reported on this, saying that the Australians were most surprised by the general shortage of daily necessities. Alcohol and cigarettes are almost impossible to obtain, and the shortage of vegetables is even more severe. The fuel problem is also extremely serious. Coal miners' strikes are heard of every day in various parts of Australia, so coal seems to have become a problem this winter. Gas and power companies have warned households to conserve energy as much as possible, as coal losses have reached two million tons due to coal mine strikes in the past nine months. This has had a great impact on railways throughout Australia, and delays in freight cars and the like have made general life feel inconvenient.</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – A British destroyer and a cruiser, each, approached Terracina on the west coast of Italy in the dim light of night and attempted to use searchlights to test the German coastal defense strength. The German coastal battery immediately opened fire fiercely, with several shells directly hitting the upper parts of the enemy ship's deck and destroying two searchlights. The enemy ship also fired back, but missed, and then retreated in defeat.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Domei News Agency: On the left flank of the US Fifth Army along the Gulf of Gaeta, the German positions west of the line from Minturno to Carillo were first bombarded by artillery. Yesterday, the US military made slight progress on the plain between the coast and Mount Massico within range of naval guns, but the Allied forces made little progress on the foothills. US Fifth Army troops were contesting for roads in the interior between Monte Croce and Monte Cesima and the foothills of Monte Miletto. General Clark attempted to gain a foothold on the highway leading to Venafro across the Volturno River. German artillery bombarded the US military to prevent the US from breaking through the German positions east of the Volturno River. The German rearguard has retreated slightly. In the central Apennine Mountains, the US military increased pressure on the German positions on Monte Miletto from the south. The left flank of the British Eighth Army advanced along the line from Cardapoli to Fresaglione to attack Isernia. In the east, the British army's attack on the German positions in Trino was repulsed by the German army, and the British army's right flank was not very active.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported: On Tuesday, General Clark's US Fifth Army's attempts to break through anywhere between Mount Massico and the upper reaches of the Volturno River all failed, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. At the same time, German main force aircraft continuously attacked the enemy's movements and deployments. There were fierce battles in the area where the Volturno River bends in the Capriati area to the northeast. The enemy attempted to cut off the retreat of the rear defense team across the river, but was blocked by the counterattack of the nearby German defense detachment. The German defense forces also prevented the US military from crossing the river, so the enemy had to retreat to the east bank of the river. In the Apennine Mountains, strong Anglo-American detachments advanced along the road leading to Isernia and were repulsed by the German army. The road is still effectively blocked. General Montgomery's British Eighth Army, after extensive reorganization, used two regiments of elite troops, under the cover of tanks and strong artillery, to attack the German line in Trino from the west of Palata. The German army on both sides of the river, under the pressure of superior enemy forces, was ordered to retreat. When the British army crossed the river and advanced one kilometer to the village of Tufara, the German army attacked from the front and both sides, and the British army was split into several groups and retreated in all directions. At the same time, German artillery fire prevented enemy reinforcements from reaching the battlefield. The British attacking army was repulsed across the river, suffering heavy losses, including six "Sherman" tanks, many prisoners of war, and a large number of weapons and equipment. German heavy artillery destroyed five British artillery positions, and fires broke out in enemy positions and ammunition depots.</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima, who had inspected military facilities in a certain area of the French coast and had cordial talks with Marshal Rundstedt and other German military authorities, returned to Berlin on the 3rd. When speaking about his impressions of the inspection, he said: This time, I made detailed inspections of all specific areas and have a full understanding of Germany's defense facilities. The conclusion I have reached is that any attempt to break through this defense and land is completely impossible. The western fortresses of Germany are all modernized and completely different from the Maginot Line, while the fortresses on the Atlantic coast are completely different from the western fortresses and are purely the latest type of fortress. I am extremely surprised by this ever-new development. The fortresses there are still being improved and strengthened at any time, so the longer it takes, the harder it is to break through. In addition, the troops stationed in France are high-spirited and numerous, so I feel that the people of the Allied countries are extremely strong and powerful.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) – British Dominion Secretary Cranborne announced in the House of Lords yesterday: The British government originally wanted to take advantage of South African Prime Minister Smuts' visit to London to hold a Dominion representative conference, but later learned that the representatives of the various Dominions could not leave their posts for long journeys, so it abandoned this attempt. The London Times reported that the British will feel extremely disappointed that the conference could not be convened this time, as there is now a need for the British Empire to act in concert to implement the same foreign and defense policies.</p>

<p>Ankara, 4th (Central News Agency) – An official Moscow communiqué stated that when British Foreign Secretary Eden and US Secretary of State Hull left Moscow, they were seen off at the Moscow airport by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Deputy Foreign Ministers Vyshinsky, Litvinov, and Gromyko, etc.</p>
<p>Ankara, 4th (Central News Agency) – Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu and British Ambassador to Turkey Knatchbull-Hugessen arrived in Cairo together yesterday morning. They are scheduled to meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden, who will be returning from Moscow soon.</p>
<p>Turkey's Policy Will Be Tested</p>
<p>Ankara, 4th (Central News Agency) – A Turkish radio commentator commented on this morning's communiqué of the Moscow Conference, but did not state Turkey's attitude. Turkish newspapers also remained silent. This attitude is in line with the silence adopted by political circles due to the uncertainty of the international political situation and the recent diplomatic policy expressed by the Turkish President. It is noteworthy that the semi-official "Ulus" newspaper published an article stating that many issues at the Moscow Conference remain unresolved, and difficult issues are left to be resolved by committees or through normal diplomatic channels. Regarding Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu's visit to Cairo to meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden, the newspapers, in addition to publishing it in a prominent position, remained silent. According to official announcements, the Foreign Minister was invited by British Foreign Secretary Eden. It is learned that the original plan was for the British Ambassador to Turkey to go to Cairo and then bring the information back to Ankara to hand over to the Turkish authorities. Therefore, the sudden invitation of the Foreign Minister must be a direct result of the Moscow Conference. Since Eden had previously held two important Anglo-Turkish meetings in Turkey, the Turkish Foreign Minister's acceptance of the invitation and visit to Cairo to meet with the British Foreign Secretary is a matter of diplomatic convention and course. The nature of the Cairo Conference is currently unknown, but most people in Turkey believe that Turkey's policy will be severely tested in the coming weeks.</p>

<h3 id="e31">The Communist Army Suppression Battle in the Taiyue Area <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>It has been five years since the Chinese Communists announced the implementation of military and political affairs in the Taiyue area in the 29th year of the Republic (1940), and they have gradually weakened due to repeated two-pronged attacks by the Japanese army. Now, the mopping-up battle has begun again, and the elite Japanese troops have directly attacked the heart of the area, the Qin River basin, searching while marching south.</p>
<p>Retreating Guerrilla Tactics</p>
<p>The Communist army, lacking frontline combat power, uses retreating guerrilla tactics and compulsory mobilization of the people in an attempt to thoroughly implement a scorched-earth policy. Once the Japanese army advances, not to mention the Communist army, even the people destroy their homes, hide their family property, and leave with food. What remains is only a desolate ruin.</p>
<p>Roads are full of landmines, and grenades are placed in each village, intending to assassinate the elite troops. When passing through canyons, they are fired at from high mountain tops. The Japanese army must climb steep cliffs, cross ravines, and pursue them, but they take advantage of their familiarity with the terrain to escape.</p>
<p>Walking for More Than Fifty Hours</p>
<p>In addition to the Communist army, what troubled the Japanese army the most in this operation was the heavy rain in the Jinnan area since mid-September, which had not been seen in more than thirty years.</p>
<p>Roads suddenly turned into muddy torrents, and bridges were completely washed away, so that the Japanese army's advance was blocked. Among them, some troops reached the starting point of the operation after walking for as long as fifty hours.</p>
<p>Destroying and Hiding Armories</p>
<p>On October 9, they entered a certain red base. Due to their destructive tactics, not even a shadow of a person was seen here. Although it was autumn, there was a winter-like chill that stung the skin, making it impossible to sleep. Crossing the river at dawn was like stepping on a thin layer of ice. The Japanese army, with the determination to exterminate the Communists, endured all hardships, broke through the outer cities, and searched every village for the invisible enemy. The war trophies of destroying enemy armories and clothing factories, which were cleverly hidden, and capturing prisoners, weapons, and materials, increased daily.</p>
<p>Using the People as a Shield for Combat</p>
<p>The people in the Taiyue area all belong to organizations such as the Farmers' National Salvation Association, the Women's National Salvation Association, the Merchants' National Salvation Association, and the Youth National Salvation Association, and they are driven to treat the war against Japan as an obligation. Their tasks are: the Farmers' National Salvation Association engages in food production, the Women's National Salvation Association manufactures military supplies, the Merchants' National Salvation Association purchases materials from security areas, and the Youth National Salvation Association divides youths from fifteen to twenty-five years old into classes to take charge of security.</p>
<p>However, the shortage of materials is becoming increasingly acute, and the equipment of the Communist army is extremely weak, and the military pay is also extremely low. On the one hand, the people's lives are also extremely difficult, barely subsisting. The oppressive atmosphere of war is gradually becoming intense, and prices are soaring endlessly, several times higher than in security areas. Recent prices, for example, are three yuan for a box of matches, twelve yuan for a bag of tobacco, seven yuan for a foot of coarse cloth, and two thousand yuan for a cow (all calculated in military currency commonly used in the Taiyue area).</p>
<p>Cruel Torture for Binding the People</p>
<p>Even in this state, the people are not allowed to complain. Crops and all other production are subject to a mandatory quota system. If the prescribed amount is not reached, harsh penalties are imposed depending on the circumstances. In front of the Communist army, the people have no way to survive other than to silently obey.</p>
<p>The scorched-earth retreating tactics are not due to the Communist Party's guidance penetrating them, but because they fear being punished under the name of traitors. And the hiding of materials is not to prevent the Japanese army from using them, but to prevent the Communist army from seizing them, so they escape and hide in stone walls. All of this shows that the people are not convinced by the Communist army, and their plight is one of having nowhere to escape. (Sho: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, October 27.)</p>
<h3 id="e32">Implementation of Unified Allocation and Sales of Cotton Products; Cotton Industry Management Office of the Business Coordination Committee to be Established <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Business Coordination Committee's Office for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth, three months have swiftly passed. The work of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth is nearing completion, and allocation matters urgently need to be addressed. According to reporter inquiries, the Purchasing Office for Yarn and Cloth will be reorganized into a Cotton Industry Management Office to handle all matters related to the unified management, allocation, production, and sales of cotton products. Tasks related to the conclusion of the purchase work will also be handled by the Management Office. Furthermore, it is learned that in addition to the current Director and Deputy Director of the Purchasing Office for Yarn and Cloth, Mr. Nie Lusheng and Mr. Cao Boquan, continuing in their roles, Mr. Sun Liyu, Secretary of the General Association, and Mr. Honda Daisaku, a specialist, will be additionally appointed as Deputy Directors. It is expected that the office will be organized in the coming days.</p>
<p>The Free Movement of "Flying Cotton" Within This City is Permitted</p>
<p>Regarding the item of "flying cotton" with yarn ends, its movement is prohibited due to its connection with military use. However, the remaining nineteen types of white flying cotton, colored flying cotton, oily cotton, chopped cotton, broken cotton, yellow cotton, ground-raised cotton, yarn-end cotton, burnt cotton, water-damaged cotton, peeled cotton, cotton scraps, old cotton batting, starched yarn ends, miscellaneous yarn ends, and cleaned flying cotton are all permitted to be moved freely. It has been found that military police personnel in the city often misunderstand this, leading to frequent detentions. Therefore, the Business Coordination Committee has specifically sent a letter to the Municipal Police Bureau, instructing all affiliated police posts to allow free movement of these items within the city's water transport areas from now on.</p>

<p>Japanese Embassy Also Hosts Tea Party to Bid Farewell</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Municipal Propaganda Office, in anticipation of the departure of the city's delegates to the Third East Asia Journalists' Congress, held a tea party yesterday morning at 10:30 AM at the China Hotel's eighth floor. Those bidden farewell were Mr. Xu Liqiu, Acting President of the China Daily, and Mr. Chen Binhe, President of this newspaper. Attending were Mr. Feng Jie, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Mr. Liang Xiuyu, Director of the Municipal Propaganda Office, Mr. Liu Yangshan, Chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Mr. Liu Shike, Director of the News Inspection Office, Mr. Zhong Youcai, Chairman of the Film Censorship Committee, and more than twenty people from various newspapers, including Mr. Tang Liangli of the China Herald, Mr. Yang Jionglang of the Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency, Mr. Zheng Hongyan of the Xin Kai Bao, Ms. Fei Feng of the Xin Zhong Guo Bao, Mr. Zhu Yongkang of the National News, and Mr. Lu Guangjie of the Ping Bao. The atmosphere was warm and lively.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Director Liang, as chairman, said: "The Third East Asia Journalists' Congress is about to be held in Tokyo. Two of the delegates from China are from Shanghai: Mr. Xu Liqiu, Acting President of the China Daily, and Mr. Chen Binhe, President of the Shen Bao. Mr. Xu is a mainstay of the Chinese press today, and Mr. Chen is a renowned political commentator in our country. The fact that these two gentlemen are attending this congress as delegates not only brings honor to the Shanghai press but also makes the entire Chinese journalist delegation feel fortunate to have such capable representatives. I believe everyone present shares this sentiment. I remember that the first East Asia Journalists' Congress was held in Guangzhou, China, at a time when Sino-Japanese relations were on the path to reconciliation and the National Government had just relocated its capital. Chinese and East Asian newspaper enterprises and news teams were being rebuilt. That congress was tantamount to a conference for the reconstruction of our Chinese and the entire East Asian news system. It was no less than the arrival of a new era for East Asia. By the time the second congress was held, the unity of East Asian nations had become even closer, and the foundation of the National Government had become even more solid. Now that the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage, the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has further solidified the firm bond between the two major nations of East Asia. Our news industry and various construction projects have made significant progress. These achievements can be attributed to the tireless efforts of our journalists and can be regarded as a testament to the expectations of previous journalists' congresses. Therefore, I hope that when Mr. Xu and Mr. Chen attend this congress as delegates, they will faithfully report to the congress how our journalists have worked under pressure in recent years. At the same time, to help us understand the efforts of our colleagues in the news industry in other East Asian countries, I hope that the two delegates will bring back to us much new and good news. When they return, we will jointly hold a grand welcome and listen to their valuable reports. Finally, I wish both Mr. Chen and Mr. Xu a safe journey and thank you all for your presence."</p>
<p>Delegates' Responses</p>
<p>Mr. Xu, Acting President of the China Daily, then delivered a speech, saying: "Mr. Chen and I are representing the press to attend this Third East Asia Journalists' Congress. In fact, we feel very humble. This congress is particularly significant after the Sino-Japanese alliance. I am merely a postman, carrying the enthusiasm of the Chinese press for the Sino-Japanese alliance to Japan. I hope to obtain many reference materials in Japan, as the Japanese press is more advanced than ours. Therefore, I only have the duties of a postman and dare not accept the congratulations of everyone." President Chen of this newspaper then said: "I have only been involved in the press in Shanghai for a year. This time, I am honored to have been invited by the Propaganda Department to attend this congress. I am willing to follow Mr. Xu to Japan to see the progress of major Japanese newspapers. This is my first time attending a congress. I am very grateful for the farewell from Director Liang and everyone." Finally, tea and refreshments were served, and the guests and hosts chatted warmly before the gathering dispersed at around noon.</p>
<p>Grand Scene at the Japanese Embassy Tea Party</p>
<p>The Third East Asia Journalists' Congress is scheduled to be held grandly in Japan. The city's delegates to the congress include Mr. Xu Liqiu, Acting President of the China Daily, and Mr. Chen Binhe, President of this newspaper. The Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy held a grand tea party at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 4th) on the ninth floor of the China Hotel to bid farewell to the two delegates. In addition to Mr. Xu and Mr. Chen attending on time, Mr. Idebuchi, Director of the Information Department of the Army Ministry, Mr. Matsushima, Director of the Metropolitan Police Department, Mr. Shioda, Mr. Hirota, Chief of the Information Section of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, Mr. Iwai, Secretary, Mr. Mori, Secretary, Mr. Takahashi, Consul, Mr. Fukuma, Vice-Consul, and dozens of others, including Mr. Hidaka Kiyoshi of the Xin Shen Bao, were present.

<h3 id="e36">Business Coordination Committee Announces Standard for Allocation of Soap; Match Allocation Goods Already Provided <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Soap and Candle Industry Association previously submitted a request to the Business Coordination Committee for regulations regarding the standards for allocated laundry soap to be moved out of the three provinces, two cities, and the Shangmei Controlled Warehouse for compliance. According to reporter inquiries, the Business Coordination Committee, after careful consideration, has responded to the association, stating: "After examining the current supply of daily-use soap in various counties outside of Shanghai, a base quantity is set each month. Members of local trade associations can apply to transport soap from Shanghai. The most reasonable standard for the allocation of soap should be to meet consumer needs. As for the allocation of soap, it has not yet been implemented. When allocation is implemented in the future, if it is necessary to determine standards, the following three items should be used as a basis: 1. The fatty acid content must be at least 50%. 2. The brand of the allocated soap must have a history of more than three years as a standard of credibility. 3. The equipment of the allocated soap factory must have a daily production capacity of more than 100 boxes to meet economic principles."</p>
<p>The allocation of two daily necessities, soap and matches, is scheduled to be realized in early this month, and the quantity has also been determined. It is learned that the Material Preparation Section of the First District Public Office has already provided the first batch of allocated matches to various provisional retail outlets, and soap can also be provided for sale within days. Therefore, the black market price of matches in the market can no longer exist, as the implementation date of allocation is imminent. It is learned that the first batch of allocated matches and soap will be supplied directly by the manufacturers and will not rely on the inventory of the managed Yingji store.</p>

<h3 id="e49">"Only the Taste of Crab Has Not Changed" <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Toyoshima, a famous writer and "representative of Japanese intellect," came to China in the 29th year of the Republic of China and offered a very insightful critique of the situation in Central China while standing in a corner of the bustling streets of Shanghai. This time, regarding the extremely changed situation in Shanghai and the attitude of the new China three years later, he could not help but exclaim "everything is very tense." In his remarks, he said: "I have heard about the high prices in Shanghai while in the country, but the displayed price lists are truly appalling. Yesterday, I drank three cups of yellow wine and consumed a small plate of vegetables on Sichuan Road, which cost 200 yuan. If you want to drink or eat a little more, you need to start with 500 yuan. The high value was unexpected. I don't know how the Japanese people in Shanghai are living." Mr. Toyoshima also said: "Although Shanghai has adopted a rationing system similar to the country, Shanghai is rich in products. Is there any difficulty in implementing the rationing system?" If we say that the only thing that has not changed is the delicious taste of Shanghai hairy crabs. This last sentence is quite humorous.</p>
<p>Mr. Toyoshima only used the standard of 300 to 500 yuan for wine and food as a temporary measure of the degree of high prices in Shanghai. If he personally witnessed the so-called "frugal banquets" costing thousands of yuan to even tens of thousands of yuan, and the so-called "national goods coats" costing tens of thousands of yuan to even hundreds of thousands of yuan, I am afraid that his degree of surprise would increase by an unknown number of times! Because Shanghai is rich in products, he instead suspects the implementation of the rationing system, which shows his sharp insight. Our understanding is that if the products are abundant but cannot be controlled, then you can buy with coupons, and you can also buy without coupons. The black market will never be eliminated. Regarding the sentence "only the taste of crab has not changed," we feel that "people have the same taste for food." However, in terms of the price of Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs, I am afraid that this crab should only be tasted by the wealthy. How can ordinary people get to taste it even once? The wartime economic state of Shanghai is like this: on one hand, there are a small number of people who have become rich due to the war and do not hesitate to spend money like dirt; on the other hand, there is the largest majority who have fallen into poverty and hardship due to the war, and even have no food for a single day!</p>

<p>New cotton from the production areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces will soon be on the market, making unified control imperative. The Shanghai office of the Materials Assistance and Unified Examination Committee, together with relevant parties, has jointly and meticulously formulated provisional measures for the unified purchase and distribution of cotton. These measures were revised and approved at the eighth meeting of the committee at the end of last month and have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and will be announced soon. These measures utilize</p>
<p>Cotton Control</p>
<p>as the central point of operation, with the Cotton Purchase Trade Association organized by the Cotton Control Association as the unified purchasing body. According to a Shanghai news agency reporter, the establishment of the Cotton Control Association is imminent, and the formation of the Purchase Association will closely follow the initial establishment of the Cotton Control Association. Although the Cotton Control Association is nominally established by the National Business Control Association as a lower-level organization, its significance and nature are similar to those of the current Grain Control Association, acting as an external institution of the Business Control Association. Its structure seems to have</p>
<p>Semi-Independence</p>
<p>and its relationship with the Business Control Association is limited to the fact that some committee members are also members of the Business Control Association. The selection of the director and committee members of the Cotton Control Association will mainly focus on those in the textile and pharmaceutical industries, with Japanese participation as well. This matter is currently under negotiation by the Business Control Association and other relevant parties. Once announced, a preparatory office will be established immediately to proceed swiftly, as the new cotton market is approaching. Everything from</p>
<p>Purchase Associations</p>
<p>the organization of, the raising of purchase funds, the adjustment of purchase prices, to the transportation and allocation of cotton after purchase must be meticulously planned in advance. Business and industrial circles (especially textile factories) are closely watching this planned unified purchase and distribution of cotton.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Trends in Chinese Stocks <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks initially rose before experiencing a lateral trading pattern. The stock prices of Wing On Company and Wing On Textile were both manipulated by large investors, with huge quantities sought. Stocks such as real estate also rose accordingly. Rong Feng Textile, Jiu An Industrial, and Jingfu Shirt &amp; Socks were all being sought after by large investors. Investor confidence has become more firm; trading was brisk throughout the day. The condition of each stock is described below.</p>
<p>Textiles: Wing On Textile started very strong, retreated slightly after testing resistance, fluctuated narrowly in the afternoon, and ultimately saw a squeeze higher; Rong Sheng rose in the morning and was further pushed higher in the afternoon, also jumping up half a grade; China Textile rose more than half a level; Xin He and Mei Ya Silk Factory also saw higher prices; Lun Hua also saw buying interest, making significant gains; Da Gong, Tian Lun, and Xin Feng tended to be firm; the small-denomination Hong Sheng Weaving also stopped its decline and turned flat; Liangfu Shirt &amp; Socks had a large volume of transactions, rising to 60% above face value; Jing Lun opened at 75% above face value; China Silk Industry trended flat.</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On Company rose and then briefly consolidated, but ultimately saw a squeeze higher; Xin Xin and Guo Huo both traded flat; China Underwear rebounded, nearing resistance; Li An Department Store also held firm.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals: China-France and Xin Ya both ultimately rose; Xin Yi saw a slight squeeze higher; Zhong Si, Wu Zhou, Xin Xing, and Jiu Fu Pharmaceuticals were all flat.</p>
<p>Finance: The Mainland Bank opened considerably higher, also reaching a new high price; Shanghai and Zhejiang Bank saw slight declines; Jin Cheng, Ye Bank, and Zhong Yi and Tong Yi Trust were stable.</p>
<p>Culture: The Commercial Press saw a new high price; China, though intermittent, rose; World alone saw a slight squeeze lower;</p>
<p>Real Estate: Lian Hua and Yong Xing Real Estate were once again pushed up by large investors; Xin Yi alone was flat.</p>
<p>Public Utilities: Zhabei Water and Electricity and Shanghai Commercial Electric were both trading near resistance.</p>
<p>Other: Hua Cheng Tobacco continued to rise slightly; Nan Yang remained flat; Great China Match continued to advance slightly; Jiu An Industrial saw nineteen households bidding, rising considerably; Great China Industrial had thin trading and remained stagnant; China and Guo Hua Investment both tended to be firm; Kang Yuan Can came back out of customs; Standard Wei Fen also rose strongly; China Film and Xin Ya Construction saw squeezes higher; the rest were stable.</p>
<p>Public Market: Yesterday's market again tended to be weak, but it still maintained a consolidation pattern. Trading was also quite thin, and investor sentiment was relatively weak. The consolidation pattern is not likely to develop for the time being. Yesterday, Type C bonds initially opened steadily, and once rose higher, but because sellers were more eager, they quickly fell sharply. The final price at noon was actually lower than the previous day. Types A, B, D, and E bonds all fell uniformly, but by a very small amount.</p>
<p>Interbank Call Loan Rate: Yesterday morning, the interbank call loan rate of the Money Trade Association suddenly rose by three points, to 1.5 cents, with funds tightening after the tenth day, which was quite unexpected.</p>
<p>Rayon: At 2 PM yesterday, influenced by news that silk factories would intensify production, investor sentiment showed a slight improvement, and buying interest gradually increased. Prices saw a slight upward adjustment. However, silk trading remained thin, and prices were lower than rayon.</p>
<p>Eggs: Due to previous shortages and merchants hoarding, prices had risen sharply. Now it is reported that the source of supply has been somewhat unblocked, and a large quantity will be shipped to Shanghai in the coming days, causing sellers to suddenly become more willing to sell. The price of chicken eggs has already fallen sharply from beyond the customs, and duck eggs have also fallen to levels within and beyond the customs.</p>
<p>Grains: Yesterday continued to be flat and soft, and interest remained weak. Grain prices fell slightly again, and oilseeds also tended to decline due to more sellers than buyers.</p>
<p>Northern Goods: Transactions remained rare and small in amount. The market presented a mix of firm and weak trends due to uneven supply and demand. Generally, red dates saw a slight upward adjustment due to a slight increase in domestic sales, while golden dates saw sluggish sales and loose holdings by retail investors, falling by a level or more.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Decisive Battle and the Awakening of the Japanese People <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Dialogue between Tokutomi Sohō and Honda Tataro (Continued from October 29)</p>
<p>Tokutomi: Mr. Honda also said that the thinking of America and Britain is completely different. Britain can be said to have encountered a robber who is taking advantage of the situation, and that robber is America. America's thinking, from any aspect, is to seize Britain's property. Therefore, it is inching forward step by step, gradually dismantling the home and taking it over, while at the same time desperately trying to defeat Japan.</p>
<p>Honda: They are obsessed with the European issue.</p>
<p>Tokutomi: Therefore, Roosevelt is probably the first speculator in the world. A boaster, an irresponsible politician like him is unprecedented in world history. I have spent a lot of time studying history, and as far as I know, there has never been such an irresponsible politician. Roosevelt's predecessors knew their responsibilities. They knew that without the German army and the British navy, Japan could not be driven out of China. But the current Roosevelt does not want all this, he only knows to move forward. If you call this courage, it is reckless courage, the courage of gambling. Tens of millions of Americans are fighting for Roosevelt's ambition. It is truly pitiful. I believe that America's weakness also lies in labor issues. The unfairness of labor issues for ten million people will become increasingly serious in the future. And in terms of food, the collapse from the increasingly difficult agriculture is also very clear. Also, in terms of life, I believe that Americans cannot endure this kind of life for five or seven years. The living conditions of Japanese and Americans are completely different. Even if we don't have a car, we can walk anywhere. They used to have cars for transportation for the average person, so if this situation continues for a long time, it will be very painful for them. Only Japan can do this. So today, if anyone thinks there is no way to deal with Britain and America, I will consider him a traitor.</p>
<p>Honda: As Mr. Tokutomi said, those who say there is no way to deal with Britain and America have fortunately not been encountered until now. I often hear people say, "Will there be any changes between Germany and the Soviet Union?" Hearing this kind of talk, I am someone who engages in diplomatic work, what is your opinion? Some people say that diplomacy cannot supplement places where force does not reach. Diplomacy does not have that kind of powerful strength. Only after using force to achieve 80% of the battle results can diplomacy succeed. Now Britain and America are often releasing rumors about Germany and the Soviet Union negotiating separately, because they don't know what attitude the Soviet Union will take in the Three-Power Conference, so they are launching this trial balloon. They are all worried that in case the situation is unfavorable, the Soviet Union may defect at any time. So this time they are exploring whether the Soviet Union will do this.</p>
<p>Tokutomi: Thinking about it, the Soviet Union's attendance at the Three-Power Conference can be inferred from the telegrams in the Japanese newspapers. The Soviet Union first wants to deal with the three Baltic countries, Finland, Ba… and Bessarabia. As for Poland, it probably refers to the eastern Polish border east of the 1939 border line. On the other hand, Vyacheslav Molotov's close confidante, Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, is participating in the Mediterranean Committee, and he is gradually becoming more active in the Mediterranean issue by sending an envoy to negotiate. Therefore, the Soviet Union's attitude is very suspicious. Many people suspect that the German army will negotiate with the Soviet Union after retreating to the Dnieper River, but Britain and America are always looking up to the Soviet Union and making concessions everywhere. The Soviet Union and Germany will actually negotiate. Even logically, it shouldn't happen. On the contrary, Hitler said that shrinking the eastern front is a planned withdrawal after reviewing the entire situation in Europe, in order to prepare for a larger offensive. In fact, even if there are changes on the eastern front, it still retains 300 divisions of troops. Only a part of them are dispatched to the Balkans and Italy. And even if the war situation changes, Hitler and Stalin's grip on the people has not wavered at all, so there will be no possibility of shaking hands halfway. All in all, it is nothing more than the shadow of Britain and America's suspicion and propaganda tactics.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in China, as Mr. Tokutomi said, after Japan gradually gains victory over Britain and America, Chongqing will naturally dissolve. Therefore, I think the rumors of overall peace are nothing more than propaganda from the opposition. (To be continued) (Xiang: From the Eastern Daily News, October 20)</p>
<p>National Forum</p>
<h3 id="e56">Discussion on Article 7 of the Wartime Housing Lease Law <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Bomin</p>
<p>In this extraordinary period, there are frequent disputes between landlords and (tenants, as well as third-party rights holders — subtenants), so the wise government promulgated a special law on housing leasing during wartime in May of this year. The content effectively nullifies the fixed-term contract agreements between landlords and tenants, and the people's housing problem has been greatly guaranteed.</p>
<p>In the past, landlords have been giving blows to tenants through the restrictions of fixed-term contracts, which is not an exaggeration. In this way, many disputes have indeed been reduced. However, Article 7 of the special law needs to be greatly discussed. The content is roughly: "The owner, in addition to bearing all expenses, shall also receive the profits he deserves." Once this article was promulgated, relatively cunning owners immediately increased rents one after another, and the rest followed suit. Some even increased the original rent by as much as several or dozens of times, claiming with confidence and assurance that the special law was their protection. Even judges in lawsuits take this as the basis, which is tantamount to giving (the tiger) wings. How can weak residents have any power to resist, and how can they remain silent?</p>
<p>It is generally recognized that materials are scarce during wartime. It is also expensive to build a new house due to the rising prices of wood and bricks. Therefore, all kinds of exorbitant demands such as small fees and deposits are made. If the value of old real estate is deliberately overestimated by inviting construction engineers, and profits are made by demolishing and rebuilding, it is not appropriate to use this as an excuse to coerce rent increases.</p>
<p>In peacetime, people's real estate is just property. There are many reasons for the soaring prices of goods during wartime, but a group of big capitalists with nowhere to invest their capital invest in real estate to preserve the value of their currency, which is stable and reliable. Unexpectedly, their investment is what people expect, and the value of real estate is raised, causing it to soar. People with a desire for profit think that profit can be obtained, and they only act like businesspeople. They kick the ball today and grab the hat tomorrow, disregarding the people's housing problem, and disputes continue to arise endlessly. The authorities then promulgated a special rental law to stop the struggle between landlords and tenants. Although the former Concession administration had a rent mediation committee to serve both landlords and tenants, the situation was complicated, and unless both parties understood each other, mediation was hardly possible.</p>
<p>Some say that landlords' rents are too low compared to prices, resulting in huge losses. This is generally recognized. Rents are indeed the lowest number currently. It is naturally justified to increase rents appropriately to make up for losses. However, if we insist on chasing prices, or use Article 7 of the special rental law as a basis to increase them by dozens or several times, at a time when the national government is stabilizing people's livelihoods, improving grain administration, and rationing daily necessities, how can we allow those with property to do whatever they want, and treat buying real estate — the people's housing problem — as a way to make profits like doing business? And housing is just property. As times change, can it be guaranteed to children and grandchildren forever?</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Xu Wuqi saying: "Those who invest in property lose three points, but enjoy ten points. Those who collect rent should collect one less liter, and they will collect for several more years." This is not intentionally digressing. To know the increase in the value of real estate, one should be comforted by the increase in the value of all properties. How can we compare the value of demolishing old materials and building new ones in this time of material scarcity? Looking at the whole city, the rent increases of several times are not uncommon. Those who are eager to move are also following one after another. My own experience is like drinking ice in winter, and everything is in my heart. Therefore, I talk about whether Article 7 of the wartime rental special law has the value of discussion. I sincerely hope that those who talk about it will respond, which is the happiness of the people.</p>

<p>I have probably eaten raw potatoes several times these days, so I have very severe diarrhea. I had no choice but to consult a familiar doctor. According to this doctor, raw potatoes contain a poisonous substance called "Solanine". This substance will only be reduced after being burned. If too much accumulates in the stomach, it will cause stomach problems, and even poisoning and death.</p>
