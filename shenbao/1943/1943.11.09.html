<p>社評</p>
<h3>期待於靑年運動指導者</h3>
<p>當前是大東亞戰爭巳達決戰階段，已達接近黎明，接近成功的階段。可是，爭取黎明，爭取成功，并不是垂手可得的容易事，也不是非我奠屬的宿命論。而是憑藉我們全亞洲十億人民團結一心，衆志成城的力量，脚踏實地去爭取的。關於這點，不但要認識淸楚，同時要澈底實踐。於此，并非說恭維話，盟邦日本的確是既認識，又實踐，而月從各面努力，祗要這部門發生局部作用者，莫不等量齊觀，不遺餘力的推進，集各個局部彙成整個，集各個力量　成總力。遠的不說，就是最近的幾個例子，已夠說明了。如大東亞會議，是亞洲大集團的結合，討論建設大東亞共　圈的共同目標。如大東亞國民大會，團結大東亞人民全體崛起。如將於十二日開始舉行的大東亞靑少年指導者會議，以喚起全亞洲靑年的團結努力。凡此都以日本為中心，邀集各國各民族共同參加，共同討論。</p>
<p>中國對於　次會議，均派代表參加，大東亞靑少年指導者會議，已由新國民運動促進委員會秘書長兼靑少年團總監林柏生氏，友中央靑年幹部學校副　育長許錫慶氏等出席，林氏尤為中國靑少年負責指導者之一，對於運次會議，必有一番收獲，尤其日本國內對於靑少年蓮動，較有基礎，可供我們借鏡者，同時亦可考察取法</p>
<p>靑年時代，為人生的朝陽，有春雷怒濤之勇氣，有天眞誠摯之熱情，勇氣最易衝動，熱情最易流露，因此，可歌可泣，可　可　之事，也最易表現，　能施以正確的指導適當的訓練，自能發生不可輕視的力量。可是，惟其靑年時代所特有的熾烈的勇氣與熱情，因之最不易駕馭。但由終人生經驗之未成熟，意志之未堅定，時局認識之朱透澈，如有正確指導，也最易陶冶。所以，領導靑年運動為最難之事，難於靑年有強烈而未成熟的勇氣與熱情，不易駕馭　，而訓練靑年工作為最易之事，易於靑年入世未深本性至善，便於陶冶。從事靑年運動者，此點似宜先予把握。至於指導大要，我們願乘此略作芻言：</p>
<p>第一，指導老應以靑年體魄健全的鍛練最為重視。人生學問事業之成功，不論　細，莫不　於強健之體魄，而強健之體魄，必須植基於靑年時代，　後來受用，諺雲　少壯不努力，老大徒傷悲　前人　用以警戒於學問事業之道，然而，我們以為不如用之於體魄鍛鍊，尤為適當。因為有了強健體魄，縱然少壯未曾努力於學問車業，就是老大了尚可補充。，惟有少壯未終健康七努力，就是有了學問事業，老大時也必力不從心難為世用了。</p>
<p>第二，指導者對於國際時屆，國內政治經濟的動態與方策，務必有極正確的指示，使靑年有極正確的瞭解。這就是現寶的思想上的訓練。誠然，體格健全，思想健全，為人生最基本的兩要素，對於國家命脈，社會改造所寄託的靑年，自應特別着重。</p>
<p>至於技術上的訓練，我們留待再論。尚有一點，值得指導靑年運動者水身注意的，就是指導者的一切言行，務必表裏一致，以身作則，在靑年觀感中發生示範作用，道樣的靑年指導，成功定可指日而待了。</p>
<h3>汪院長在日廣播　披瀝堅定之信念　盡力貫澈戰爭完成建設</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　中國國民政府汪行政院長，頃就此次大束亞會議之意義及出席會議之感想，於束京中央廣播電合對外廣播演說，關於中國完遂大束亞戰爭之決意如次：余此次得參加世界史上具右偉大意義之大東亞會議，內心至感榮幸，開會中，傾聽日本東條首相之偉論，並親接各國代表之高論，衷心益深感佩。囘顧百來以年，英。美兩國恣意行其侵略榨取政策及貪婪無厭之　食世界野心，英國努力始　對南洋　伸張至中國，進而引起鴉片戰爭，美國亦由太平洋侵入東亞，聯合英國，形成夾擊之勢，其時東亞民族已瀕於千鈞一髮之危機，幸日本獨自奮起，始克阻止英　美之野望，然英美雖遭此打擊仍不敢其野心，專事於東亞民族問桃撥離問，使之相互鬥爭，幾無寶日。及至大東亞戰爭開始，英　美兩國在東亞之勢力　告崩潰，英　美侵略榨取之所得其企圖，乃完全被日本顛覆，由是言之，故凡大東亞諸民族，對於日本保障東亞之功續，不得不表感佩。又日本認為英。美兩國之危害東亞，全繫於其侵略榨取政策，故於軍退英　美勢力後，更進而圖摧減其傳統的政策，即以共存代替一方之侵略，以共樂轉換一方之　取，使東亞民族各　自主獨立，且相互　　其自主獨立。在文化方面，發揮其創造力與　　力，在經濟方面實行互惠，長短相補，有無相題，此種基本方針，正與英。美之傳統政策相反此即東洋道義精神與西洋功利思想異趣者也。此次大東亞會議，係日本發起，聯合東亞各國家，以團結之力量、發　道義精神，此種偉大實獻，不僅為大束亞各國家永久友好之基礎，且為全世界永久和平之基礎。中華民國國父孫先生實言，日本之維新即亞洲之轉機，此言於今日已證實矣，孫先生提　之大亞洲主義，切望日本協助巾國廢除不平等絛約者，亦於茲具體化矣。余曾於數日前，與日本駐華大使簽訂中　日同盟條約，今日又代表中華民國參加大東亞會議，簽署共同宣言，深感光榮，余深信參加大會之各國代表，均具右同樣之熱意與信念，故深信大東亞戰爭之目的必能貫澈，大東亞建設亦必能完成，然完成以上之目的及以上之任務，實有賴於東亞各國家民族之各自努力及共同努力。先進國之日本，已發揮最大之力量保護東亞，僅期待我等各新興國家及希望復興之國家。能各盡其全力，分擔貫　戰爭，完成建設之責任，大東亞光明燦爛之事業，惟有大東亞各國家民族之分別努力，共同努力，始能完成。英　美以前所用之侵略榨取政策，已被擊破，挑撥離問政策，亦化為泡影，今後無論其用何稱政策，任何甜言密語引誘或開空頭支票，或散亦謠言，均不能動搖吾人之僧念。今吾人已不再受其壓迫，不再受其欺騙，吾人確信大東亞各國家各自努力，共同努力之給果，必能解放大柬亞，必能使大東亞之光明燦爛，照爐於世界　於茲謹對盟邦日本及諸友邦致最大之敬意。</p>
<h3>張國務總理　昨下午返滿　行前在東京廣播演說</h3>
<p>新京八日中央社電　滿政府弘報處八日發表，張國務總理大臣，前為出席犬東亞會議赴日，茲以事畢，八日下午由東京返抵新京。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　滿洲國張國務總理，於八日上午十時假東京中央廣播電合作廣播演說，題為「以堅決之團給，爭取最後勝利之光榮」，茲詩其大意如次。。</p>
<p>余此次以滿洲國代表資格，得出席大東亞會議，簽署大來亞共間宣言，深感榮宰。於此特告全來亞同胞諸君。具有光輝文化及傳統東亞各國，前會步入屈辱與忍從之荊棘途徑，受英　美之侵略，英美之歷榨，供之犧牲，渝為隸役，當此之時，唯右日本承明治維新之大樂，力抗彼等之壓迫，保持自主發展之榮譽。溯英。美在東亞所為之罪惡，不勝枚學。彼等為滿足其物資慾，乃利用一切手段，在文明開化之美名下，奴隸東亞各民族，於物質上精神上施行種種侵略政策。此時整個東亞民族，均慘受英。美之暴虐，先覺之志士，雖實為束亞之復興而抗爭。而流血，而犧牲，然東亞各國以未能打破積年以來之封建流弊，未能團結一致，終於為英　美謙略所乘，恣其意行。我滿洲國在東亞紛亂之際會　然崛起，在日本之援援助與四千萬民衆　門下，從事建設，十年來之功　，滿洲國已成為近代國家，新秩序之推動。日本自發動大東亞戰爭後，英。美在東亞勢力已被廊淸，被淪為殖民地之東亞各地，已恹復基本然悉態，如中國主權之得以完整，泰國領土之調整，緬甸之獨立，非律東之獨立，自由印度臨時政府之成立，荷印各地原住民之參政等，均足以為束亞史上之永久紀念而不能忘者。令深信如此偉大建設，在　　英烈之砲烟張雨問，節飾實現，實為日本之不拔信念與堅強之實行力所賜，深表敬意。又東亞各國各民族，如今為東亞自覺所喚醒，滿懷　還我東亞木來面”之熱烈意志，衷心更為欣快，此東亞魂之奔流，此新天地之創造，實屬何物不能阻撓之必然天理自然之歸趨也。相東亞人對於此　　　樂而若無　　，當無其人，即為英　美　　　　　　　　　內地之人士，亦必將於胸中醞起共感，即呻吟於英國虎政下之印度四億民衆，翹首此新天地，亦不禁為自己之命運大表同情也。余於此會議中，親與盟邦諸國代表相唔，推誠披　所使，互議建設東亞之使命，對完遂戰爭之決心與建設之熱意，深受感動，余等堂堂向世界　明之宣言，此正為俯仰天地而不恥之天下大義，此絕非英　美所約定之大西洋意章，徒戮和平之美名典人道假面具，汲汲欲維持自利者所可毀也。</p>
<h3>緬甸副總理聲明　已完成應戰措置　—對印不惜予以一切援助—</h3>
<p>仰光八日中央社電　緬甸副總理　金米亞，六日曾就大東亞會議事發表聲明，力　大東亞會議乃東亞空前未有之大會議，此次會議已充分證明，東亞民族之運命巳完全為大亞洲掌握，其要旨如次：此次會議誠為於新東亞之歷史上掇一新頁之會議。東亞民族於此。已確立其開拓自己運命之民族權利。又因此次會議東亞各國對其共同敵人作戰之同志結合，當益擊固，緬甸國民之對日信賴，當愈堅定，各國代表於此次會議中，對戰爭問題曾充分交換意見，以此次定全束亞之綜合一致政策，故在束亞絕無如反軸心陣營之觀念，鬥爭之混亂狀態發生，此乃緬甸政府所確信者。蓋此次會議即係說明大東亞共榮圈之建設已獲一大成果，緬甸於獲得獨立後，已決意澈底努力於解放東亞之鬥爭，吾人之所以右此決心者，即因深知必須團結，否則必亡之故，因此緬甸乃於印人希望予以援助之今日，而不惜予以一切援助，挺身向英美挑戰，今緬旬已完成其各種應戰措置，國家機構已強化，至堪克服任何困難之程度。</p>
<h3>建設東亞過程中　劃一新紀元史實　近衛稱贊六國會議盛舉</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日本前內閣總理大臣近衛文曆公爵，七日發表談話，高　大東亞共存共榮之根本理念，並稱讀大東亞會議之盛舉。其大意謂：今英　美於大東亞實行榨取之一切根據地已全喪失，緬甸。菲律賓先後宣言獨立，印廣納西亞民族之光榮自由印度臨時政府亦告成立，大東亞已呈現有史以來之壯觀。而中華民國國民政府之還都南京，自不能不謂為解放復興大東亞之先驅，國民政府對滿洲等大柬亞各國家各民族教厚交誼，尤其與我國自同甘共苦進而為同生共死，並對英。美亦吿宣戰，今目賭其命運　進，完成大東亞戰爭，吾人謹於此衷心表示敬意。綠建設大東亞共榮圈之大理想，乃以悠久不減之勝利光榮為基礎，始能完全實現，使之永久發展，吾人當協　力最大使命，乃在相所相負，增強戰力，　期早日　　英　美。此次之六國會議，堪稱建設大東亞新秩序過程中　一新　元之史賓，余議以滿　熱意，視福大東亞之前途。</p>

<h3>基輔集結重兵　成戰局中心　寇許東北部激戰中</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　當此克里米亞半烏戰局　見嚴重之際，德軍復由轟伯河上游要衝務輔撤退，因此東綫乃頓告緊急。茲德軍當局就各重要戰區之戰况說明如次：「基輔方面」束綫之戰局中心，目下仍在基輔方面，現蘇軍於該市北方及西北方約右步兵卞六師團·戰車三集團·從事對穗軍猛攻。德軍與蘇軍激戰後，幣毀其坦克車七十三輛，擊毀其飛機七十一架。五日已退至後方預定陣地。六日蘇軍繼續猛攻，在基輔北方及西方一進一退，戰鬥極烈，六日蘚軍於基軸東南亦曾出以局部攻擊，惟已失敗。「寇許方面」蘇軍曾於寇許地峽東北部之丘陵地區，以有力部隊猛攻德軍，兩軍激戰甚烈，蘇軍會企圓通過池沼地帶突破德軍陣地，但結果受重創而退。「貝萊科普方面」德軍曾於克里米亞半島明喉部之貝萊科善地峽出以反攻，將蘇軍之突破企國擊　，惟此後蘚軍仍在積極增援，坦克車及步兵部隊企圖繼　攻舉德軍。基輔南方之具列斯拉夫爾方而蘇軍曾猛攻德軍二十餘次，但德軍陣地毫未動搖。</p>
<p>尼維爾西坦克大戰</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：星期六日北路穗軍在尼維爾河彎曲處，獲得防禦性貿之十足勝利，德空軍在此勝利中，亦有重大之貢獻。右市鎮之西·蘇軍會集中强大之坦克車隊輿步兵隊，意圖　入德軍之陣綫，並裂開德軍之前綫，旋即展開劇烈之坦克車大戰。德猛攻砲分遺隊，亦參與作戰，在有力之反攻中，德軍終於擊破蘚軍之攻勢，而予敵以人力賓物質上極重大之損失。入晚蘇坦克車五十二輛被舉潰於戰塲上，德戰鬥機在該區上空，擊落蘚機二十架·因此蘇軍於星期六日，共計損失飛機九十一架。東繞北部戰事限於拉多加湖以南之術鋒活動，蘇步兵在人造霧掩護之下進攻二次，均在德軍主要戰綫之防禦砲火前宣告崩潰。</p>
<p>克島咽喉蘇軍增援</p>
<p>寇許之南與北沿克里米亞沿海岸之高地，德軍與優越之蘇軍發生劇烈之戰爭，德轟主機輿斯多加機參加作戰，收效甚大，引起敵軍嚴重之損失。在克里米亞半島之北部出口處·較小之蘇軍部隊，為德軍所阻或遭殲減，或被迫後退。前一日蘇軍在貝來科　題頭地所突破之缺口一處，已由德軍輿羅馬尼亞軍，予以消減，並收或將有新的突破之企圖。轟伯河下游之北，德　彈兵與坦克車突擊蘚軍所佔領而堅防之區城一處，收復村莊一所，並　獲中型與重型之敵砲四十尊，以及其他軍器多種·敵步兵一師團被殲或被俘。穗軍在聶怕河套之進攻頗為順利，蘚軍一大隊被包圍而就殲。</p>

<p>斯丹埠八日中央社電　英外相艾登與土外長曼里卓格魯自五日起，在開羅開始會談，六日曾先後訪謁埃及國王烏魯克八世。刻會談仍秘密進行中一，關於會談內容僅有種種臆測，惟無確訊。</p>
<p>土京八日中央社電　據海通社訊：土耳其各報評述土外長曼里卓格魯與英外相艾登會談一事，一致主張應審慎為之，不可速即與之商定決議。如「艾弗克耶報」之言有謂，「毫無理由之參戰」徒使國家流血犧牲而已。</p>
<p>傳英土間成立諒解</p>
<p>瑞典京城八日中央社電　據「斯德哥爾摩日報」引「星期快報」消息稱：英土外交代美在開羅討論之結果，已成立了解。由土將堅强之據點割讓與英，但此項割讓了解之正式成立，必將以一九三九年之英土協定為根據。土方亦已提出交換條件，其中包括新借疑及更多之戰時物資，割讓地以飛機塲為主要老。該報復稱，英土了解事項中，亦包括反軸心國運兵可經過土國</p>
<p>土國方面渴望和平</p>
<p>安加拉八日中央社電土耳其京城政界與外交界人士現正以緊張之情緒，預期英外相艾登與土外長曼里卓格魯目下在開羅會議之結果，此等人士對於美國駐土大使斯坦哈特由美廉程赴開羅之消息予以特別注意。消息靈通之政界方面認為土耳其將被提出自戰爭爆發以來迭經展緩之參戰問題。路透社外交主　於星期四日晚明白宣稱，關於戰爭之結果，土耳其將準備作最大之犧牲，路透社所暗示之主題，足以影響土耳其之輿情。據路透社之說法，開羅會議之目的，足令人注意英國方面第一次公閉提起土耳其將被要求參戰之可能。土耳其方面對於英方所稱土耳其已由非交戰國之狀態漸變為積極參載一節，提出嚴重之抗議，土耳其方面歷重聲明土耳其願望戰爭急速結束，但並無參戰之憲。自　爭開始以來，英國會在士耳其全國建設各種飛機塲，關於此點，土耳其方面始終　重說明此種讀步，純為土耳其根據其對外政策之自衛態度而作之防禦準備。安加拉右資格之政昇人士鑒於英國對葡萄牙輿亞索爾軍烏之態度，預料對土耳其亦將右類似之行動，英國之外交意欲利用亞索爾羣島事件之前俐，擬向土耳其理論無須完全放棄中立，而以海空軍根據地割讓與反軸心國，或准許蘇聯有假道遝輪之權利。英國外交方面　宣稱，此為土耳其在英土協定範圍內最低限度之買獻，此間一般人認為今後反軸心對土耳其將提出更具體之要求。</p>
<h3>德機在地中海　猛擊護航隊　義南部德軍反攻</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德元首行營七日發表特別公報稱：德空軍予西地中海之敵運輪艦與供應船以另一重大之打擊。德聶炸機隊在北非沿海岸外低飛襲擊由滿載軍隊之運輪艦廿二艘與驅逐艦八艘所組成之敵護航隊一隊，投下破壞力强大之炸彈與魚雷，擊中敵船十三艘共十四萬噸，以及驅逐艦二艘·穗轟炸機人員凱旋而歸時，尚望見敵運艦數艘在焚燒與下沉中，英美靑年兵士數千名與被毀之船雙同時葬身海底。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：義大利南部穗軍加緊抵抗對人數優越之英美軍，完成防禦上不容爭辯之勝利。德軍在維納弗洛飛機塲發動集中之進攻，經砲兵周到之準備後，向英美軍猛攻隊襲擊，攻勢甚猛，致反軸心軍被裂分於聖馬利亞克里維托與羅加拉·文杜拉之問。德軍不但填平前一日之缺口一處，並與敵擲彈兵在敵軍之展開區內激戰。德軍分遣隊奪得戰略上其有重要價值之高地數處，並由此阻止美軍之增援前綫，且將其擊　至原陣地之外，美坦克車七輛被毀。伏爾托諾河流域以西，英美在維亞卡四里那之突破企圖結果完全失敗。附近公路與山岳間，德軍以破壞力强大之武器迎擊敵軍，敵猛攻四次，均在德軍如雨之砲彈下崩潰。克拉克將軍之美第五軍因正面猛攻無勝利之機會，乃以小隊兵力企圖　入德軍之側面，但此項計劃又為穗軍所破。</p>
<p>亞平寗山區方軍再後撤</p>
<p>亞平寗中加拿大軍與英軍編續顯示保留之態度，德後防隊由福田走下羅維里與阿格晨等處撤退，而未與敵發生接觸。東　在亞秣里亞沿海岸附近英軍在坦克車掩護下，發動二次强大之攻勢，被阻於德軍陣綫前，敵在激戰中被擊退。蒙高茂萊將軍之部隊在斯敘尼附近與福爾西附近蒙重大之死傷，此外英坦克車十七輛為平　砲輿高射砲分　所擊毀。德戰鬥轟炸兩用機　亂特里諾河以東之敵供應交通，以及帖木里附近之英軍登陸行動，體艇二艘被擊沉，另有三艘受損，大批運貨汽車艦隊被擊散，至少有滿載之貨車七輛起火焚燒。</p>

<p>就大局觀，英美的　入意大利本土，可分為兩個　段：　自卡拉勃里亞上陸後迄巴特里奧政權肯叛為止，　侵入沙雷爾諾方面暨帖木里地甌而引起德軍和英美軍眞正衝突。國時，從所謂愈大利防術戰的見地看，現在的戰綫，其內容亦與過去過然不同了，這就是說，往日的意大利陸軍今日已不存在，他們現已採用眞的德意志式作戰，而且充分戰揮彈性防禦的眞價值，以補武器及兵力的劣勢。在伏肅托　河畔一戰之後，中部意太利的亞平靑山脈是愈來愈險峻了，英美今後的推進，將益為困難，是可以想像的。筆者因為謠言戰火迅速迫近羅馬，留在羅馬祗是焦集，所以直接跑上戰塲去巡禮。踏上火綫之後，方才發　那全是無謂的席人自擾。慣戰能征的穗軍士兵，其意氣的據慨激昂，粉碎了我們的祀憂。</p>
<p>有人或許會間道：那未，英笑軍如果在德軍後方實行新的上陸作戰，那又如何？據迄今與英美軍交戰的前方作戰首腦部脫，這種事當然是不會責現的，所以他們正和優勢的英美軍大戰方酣。</p>
<p>德國對於此事。當然在研究萬全的措置，準備時機一到，即將毅然展開反攻的閃電作戰。即使不然，在有作戰上的必要時，也右必勝的成算在胸。過去自九月十五日起的半個月間，在沙雷爾諾和艾鮑里的激戰中，一舉舉退英國第八軍的一部及美國第五軍的那種事實，即為明證。</p>
<p>巴特里奧政權不穩</p>
<p>英英之亟圖打開戰局的熱慮，由他們在承認巴特里奧政權後，當即於十月十三日使之對德宣戰的事上，可以窺知一斑。英美蘇之承認巴特里奧政權為對德攻擊的協力者，祇是一種形式而已，並非是眞心誠意的，進從英美引出以反巴特里奧著名的亡命政客斯福爾蔡這點，更可明白。斯福爾蔡現在雖任巴特里奧的外相，唯風傳他將就任首相而取天下。總之，巴特里奧本身的政治立塲是正在迅速日　不穩中。</p>
<p>無論怎樣，當英美飛機在天空散巴特里與的對德宣戰佈告時，羅馬市民根據在英美的佔領之下尚且要被迫再從事戰爭的理由，一律表示反對，認為這是此九月八日巴特里奧發表停戰而背棄三國同盟那事更殘酷的叛逆行為·不勝憤慨。這樣，英美進綫的巴特里奧宣戰一幕，結果並未博得民心，反使演出的巴特里奧和導演的英美大失信望。</p>
<p>英國利用印度軍隊</p>
<p>是在前綫　到的情報：擁立巴特里奧政權而沿亞得利亞海岸北進的英國第八軍，據說已派印度軍推進到內夫洛（在康包巴索東北方三十公里」。自從北非戰爭以來，由杜勃魯克，的黎波里，，瑪勒斯要塞的激戰，以至最近為突尼西亞戰最後一幕的加泰尼亞戰役中奮戰的，便是這支印度第四師團，它是英國第八軍的最强部隊旁遮普州出身的希克族和格齊普托族，乃是不怕死的戰鬥部隊。每逢第八軍司令部派印度師團打前鋒的時俟，其意義就是戰局已到不利他們的時俟了。</p>
<p>應該為祖國印度的獨立而戰的印度士兵，竟與祖國之敵一同遠征意大利。在這當中，正包藏着英軍當局狡滑的操縱術。原來這批用旁遮普州甘蔗護成的烈酒養育大的印度士兵，飲了英兵的威士忌酒以後，便令猛然站起，無綠無故不顧一切的向死地突進，至於獨立的意氣，對祖國的熱愛，那更不要說，是一起丟到「爪哇國」裏去了。他們這次挺刃向着德軍，也完全是為了英國的酒呀</p>
<p>這不是　空捏造的，是有證據的。當羅美爾軍進攻埃爾。阿拉眠的時候，防守杜勃魯克要塞直到最後一瞬的，便是這個印度師團的一部。他們被英軍捨棄以後，因為酒精喝完了的綠放，就答應軸心軍的招呼，立刻中止交戰，因此德軍隊容容易以的開進城內。總而言之，現在的戰局是非常的困難，所以英國第八軍</p>
<p>羅馬成非武裝都市</p>
<p>反映這種前緩動態的後方空氣，在這四十日問，也恢復了絕對的平靜。為全世界四億天主教徒聖都的羅馬。在行政上也將改為獨立的國家性組織，完成所謂非武裝都市的計劃，正與日俱進。這因為德軍和進駐羅馬同時，早就闈明了德國尊重非武裝都市的態度，並且西班牙，阿根廷·葡萄牙。端士等中立國也熱烈支持這種計劃。教廷當局業已向交戰各國要求承認的消息，也是可以相信的。內容如何，現在雖不明白，大約是由非武裝都市更進一步，擬使羅馬市的地位近於自由都。</p>
<p>又，關於敎廷，英方正在宣傳敎皇已成德軍俘虜的　說，聲稱為了救出敎皇，行將進攻羅馬。在於這補憑空捏造的行為，現已發生莫大的反籌。以神聖不可侵犯的敎皇作為戰爭的宣傳資料，使梵蒂岡方面非常憤慨，教廷的不滿英方，已漸漸難以掩蔽丁。</p>
<p>要之，隨戰况的進展，正努力使羅馬繼續站在戰爭圈外。在德軍的統制下，至少已恢復了巴特里奧政權當時」無的平靜與秩序，這種事實是羅馬市民所感謝的。久遭禁演的戲劇和音樂，近來也解禁了。今日正逐漸　成了使人忘記戰爭的霧國氣。不過，大家都深恐再有新的侵入者來破壞這種和平。這就是羅馬的實情</p>
<p>每逢等陸意大利的美兵在各地酗酒鬧事，調戲婦女，惹起種種糾葛時，對於德軍嚴肅的規律，更令人贊成不置。自從羅馬防守司令修泰爾將軍　城第一擊高喊：「德意應將過去一切付諸流水，再行協力！」以來，穗意的新協力體制便無時無刻不在加强發展中。（衣奈特派員二十一日羅馬發）（　：譯自十月二十三日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>盬田大尉昨廣播　波根雜爾戰局　日海空軍偉大戰果</h3>
<p>中央社訊　南太平洋日美作戰日益熾烈，尤以所羅門方面戰綫之勁向，尤為世界所屬日，日駐　艦隊報道部　田大尉，昨晚九時三十分在上海電台廣播說明彼根維爾島之戰局，茲錄廣播之要旨如下：</p>
<p>敵人目的</p>
<p>敵人作戰目的在不與日本以「時間」：去年八月以來，敵人以澳洲為基地，對我距離　遠之前進地瓜速　爾康納爾開始所謂「對日德反攻」，在此一年三個月月中，敵人光後舉行　北克會談，華盛頓會談，及莫斯科會談，誇稱將對日採取大攻勢，並以羆大之人力資　及物力資源供犧牲，但其可獲得者僅能從瓜達爾　枘實島向培拉拉培拉如此我方之預定戰略「出血戰術」，已着着　效矣</p>
<p>對日本不不以時間之戰方針，自魁北克會談以來敵方以太平洋為第一綫儘速加强力量攻擊日本，如至明年或後年口欲擊潰日軍不能不流無　量之血二，此點應加慮及」云云强調如果使日本有時間則戰事必敗，故敵方所最感　木之時時刻刻益臻强大。</p>
<p>作戰猛烈</p>
<p>十月十六日以來，對於南太平洋之敵人反攻作戰漸趨猛烈，此亦企圖不使日本有充分時間，因此該方面屢有一百　至三百架之敵機來　，敵軍部隊並於二十七日在波根維爾島　諾島登陸，以此情形　，敵方企圖以美國及澳洲之全力，集中於新幾內亞，波根維爾島一舉突破陣地，奪囘我前綫主要地點，布英及拉巴爾，更以此為基地，　亂我經濟　及軍需資源各地方，故由此可想像敵人如不放棄此種反攻戰略，則敵人將來不顧任何犧牲出以反攻。二十七日在　諾島爾近之海戰及五日公布之波根維爾島海戰，六日公布之波根維爾空戰，俱可表現敵方焦躁之形狀，蓋長期作戰對於現正開發南方儲地域資源之我方，極屬有利，而於敵方唯恐作戰長期化也。</p>
<p>海空大戰</p>
<p>波根維爾島空戰與海戰：此種　縮短時間之敵方反攻作戰，因受我方「出血戰術」打擊，在摩諾島附近有巡洋艦四　遭擊沉，又在波根維爾島海戰中有巡洋艦八　至九　及驅逐艦九　被擊沉，或擊毀，此外又有企圖援助此等大運輸部隊，並欲一舉粉碎我　　，而北上之航空母艦二艘巡洋艦四艘及驅逐艦二艘等强力機動部隊，亦於摩諾島與鳥特拉克島中地點。遭我機炸沉，而此波根我維爾島海戰之役，我方僅損失飛機十五架，空戰中損失三架，日軍之　　必　精神，世界軍事專家及英美軍事評論家，莫不表示驚　。麥克沃塞正夢想奪囘拉巴爾，於十月十七日以後曾以前所未見之大空軍繼續不斷攻擊波根維爾島及新幾內亞島之芬希夫海與拉巴爾，其中二十二日至廿六日之五日間，對該方面三地點來襲之敵機，總數共二千〇六十四架，我方每次予以迎擊，粉碎敵人戰鬥力收獲大戰果，敵於卅一日派遣有力運　船隊向新佐治島北上，我海軍航空部隊立即發現，於當夜進起，至十一月二日晨炸沉或擊毀運輸船四艘，及舟艇四十艘以上，並炸沈或擊毀護衛運輸船隊之巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦三艘，同時我海上部隊亦出動，於十一月一日夜屢開狀烈夜戰，敵艦隊受吾　　亦有五　至六艘被炸沉或炸毀，並喪失驅逐艦四艘，敵艦於倉卒間竟有一艘驅逐艦遭己方轟毀，於此可見敵方狼狽之情形。</p>
<p>敵人自卅一日晚迄二日晨為止，除有一部隊登陸外，其餘殆遭全滅，但麥克活　猶命令美艦隊司令官哈爾塞於二日以二百數十架飛機攻擊拉巴爾，但亦遭我海軍航空部隊擊落一百廿七架，遭海上部隊擊落五十一架，為地上部隊擊落二十三架，合計二埯成〇二架，占敵機全部之九成</p>
<p>諱飾敗績</p>
<p>麥克沃塞於進攻波根維爾島前，曾召集艦隊司令官哈爾塞，陸上部隊司令官哈蒙，海兵隊司令官格里德等討論作戰方針，席上麥克沃塞曾以自信之態度誇稱：「一星期以內當奪取波根維爾島，用以建造戰鬥轟炸聯合航空基地」云，然麥克沃塞於三十一日至二日間喪失人力一萬人，無數艦　飛機以及航空母艦　艘，彼胸中恐亦惑極度悲傷，而美國之新聞電報，不知早巳　知買克沃塞心中之悲戚，抑或受彼之指令，大事報　美艦隊自希望遭遇日本艦隊，即使受極大美損戰害亦生產得局巳長也發時表　：「美國　機生產量記更形增加，「使國民轉變目光，不注意因此次遭受日本之「出血戰術」，而日益减少之美國生產力、以及波根維爾島之損失，美國雖然應　宣傳，力事議飾，但在此次海戰中巳充分果露矣。</p>
<p>弱點顯露</p>
<p>波根　爾島及新幾內亞芬希夫海之戰况一敵人難用期最大兵力，但作戰仍不能如意，其理由在敵之運愉接濟不充分之故，因前進東地與前綫距騐愈客，則接清愈容易，因此敵人接濟路自漢洲延至瓜達爾康納爾以迄波根爾島，此使美國戰鬥力之弱點更為擴大，故敵人愈接近我內方戰略圈內，則敵人弱點　形顯露。</p>
<p>以波根維爾島海戰中彼　之損失而觀，即在空中巳之獲之得損四對一之空戰，以吾機三架而換得敵人全部機動部隊之全滅，此偉大戰果為歷史上所未見者，凡此皆為吾海軍飛機卓絕技術，以及超越鬥志有以致之，敵人力謀「不能時間與日本」，但吾方作戰正依照預定計劃進展，同時開發南方亦順利推進，於此次大戰果中，即可表示我日本生　力巳有顯著之增强矣。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>所得稅與交易稅</h3>
<p>一國籌集戰費的正當辦法，不外於增加租稅與發行公債兩途，而以增發紙幣為下策，不但為下策，而且是飲鴆止　的慢性自殺政策；可是，發行戰時公債，而消化成績欠伴，則其結果又為紙幣的增發，依然又是下策與慢性的自殺政策·所以，戰時財政的最良政策，仍為徵收租稅，以資應付軍政各費。</p>
<p>依據日昨財部上海所得稅辦事處所披露的消息，自徒租界收囘以來，第一八兩區內各公司企業向該處自動申報之應繳營業盈利所得稅額，已達三千六百萬元之鉅，由此可知目前我國戰時財政，顯巳踏上依靠增稅以度雖關的一個途徑了。此外，昨日奉令復業之華商證券交易所開拍華商股票而後，復代財部微收現貨股票買賣交易稅萬分之六，其辦法為貴成原經紀人向買塊當事人附帶各微半數，付與該所衆解，這又是目前我國戰時財政走入增稅途徑的一個顯例。</p>
<p>本來，一國的歲出，應該多多地責成有能力者負擔，平時固然，戰時尤然。上述公司企業人利所得稅的繳納，與股票現貨買賣交易稅的徵收就是要使有能力者多多負擔國家軍政經費的兩個具體表示。但願財政當局，在收縮通貨，增加歲入，抑平物價，安定民生幾個並行不背的課題下，徵收租稅，處處求其合理化，祇要切合需要，衹要避免苟捐，人民總該無話可說的。</p>
<h3>證交昨正式復業　開拍華股現貨　電話尚未裝竣交易淸稀</h3>
<p>華商證劵交易所於昨日上午九時半起在該市塲正式開巿復業，經核准之一百四十四家經紀人均偕代理人一名佩帶證章到塲，關係當局及證券監理會方面均有代表到塲監視，此外一概拒絕入塲參觀，交易時間至十二時，下午停巿，惟昨日上午開拍時因塲內電話尙未完全裝竣，故各股票行號之買賣，仍不能集中，加以天雨綿綿，交易淸稀，總額共為八十萬元。預料今晚有三十雙對講電話可以裝就，其錄亦於本週內即可辦妥，故前途當有良好之進展。</p>
<p>交易單位</p>
<p>聞該所上市之華股交易單位分十股·一百股·五百股三種</p>
<p>升降範圍</p>
<p>每盤漲跌之價格，在一千元以上者為十元，一千元以下五百元以上者為五元，五百元以下二百元以上者二元五角，二百元以下一百以上者一元，一百元以下五十元以上者為五角，五十元以下二角半，十元以下者一角。</p>
<p>佣金五厘</p>
<p>證交方面所收之手續費，業經規定為凡經紀人向買　雙方各收千分之五，證交方面則向各經紀人教千分之一·二五，其三·七五之餘額，即為各經紀人所得之手績費，此外並須征收交易稅萬分之六</p>
<p>現期買賣</p>
<p>該所之股票交易定為現期買賣，分隔日即交及七日便交兩種，即交者於翌日下午二時前交劃，即交者於每週一下午二時前交割，所有交割手續均委託國信銀行辦理。</p>
<h3>當局嚴禁　非法交易</h3>
<p>違者懲究不貸</p>
<p>本巿整個物價問題，在主管當局嚴格監督之下，已呈穩定狀態，諸几投機囤積，操縱，抬價，及買空賣空之非法交易，均在嚴禁之例，任何人如政經營上述各項交易之一者，概不徇情，一律依法愁究不貸。几任何一種物品，欲在巿上流通買賣，必須於事前呈請關係當局評定標準限價或允准後，始可經　，但於呈請時應</p>
<p>列表叙明</p>
<p>品目，　出產地，　商標名目，　出品年月日，　製造成本，　希望應得利潤等項，記者昨向各業有面探悉，上週工商各業頗鮮變動。</p>
<p>工業方面</p>
<p>除少數工廠已逐漸獲得原料，準備開工出貨，大多數主要商品工廠如紡織印染廠，橡膠廠等終因不易獲得製貨原料，仍暫停工休業中。惟各該工廠皆為週應目前環境，已紛紛自動增加資本。</p>
<p>商業情形</p>
<p>大多數次要商品市價，顧無軒輕，並現貨籌碼充斥，諒係大宗　貨出　，惟其中數類主要商品，如食　，　料，呢　等，有者因存貨稍稱，來源受阻，有者因失路轉暢，　價稍有反動，當局已寄予密切之注意，至於新開設之商號殊甚稀少，原有商號經改組受　者反見增加，故本市工商業已由畸形轉為凋落。</p>
<h3>軍配組合事務歸　貿聯會接辦</h3>
<p>數年來在臨中區域執打物資統制及配給之「中支那軍裏交　用物賣配紛組合」，（即谷稱軍配組合）其一切事務，自即日起由「申華日本貿易聯令會」機承接辦查軍配組令向在華中地域頗佔勢力，即如機油等主要物資。其終極之</p>
<p>配給權限</p>
<p>即　之於該組會之手。今年六月下旬，華中地區內之日本工商業公司洋行銀行工廠魯計四十單位，在日大使館經濟部策動之下，籌組「日本貿易聯合會，」統括日方各配給及運輸組合，為華方商統會相互協辦、該聯合，　組雖久，直至最近始告正式成立，經日官方之後援，先後接辦日方各產業團體。實力强大之軍配組合，自亦不能例外。據日大使館方而表示，日本買易聯合會與華方商統會實為</p>
<p>姊妹團體</p>
<p>今後該聯合會當予商統會以最大可能之協力與合作，使後者在各項　　事工上一無　制，即如精油等主要物資，其終極之統制權限，亦將歸需於商統會之體系內軍配合組合之被貿易聯合會吸收，殆為華中區域內物資統制權限明期　淸之初步象　云。</p>
<p>各業公會動態</p>
<p>列入主要商品後，該業同業聯合會在全國商統會主特之下，業巳成立籌備處，頃悉籌備工作大體巳告就緒，定於本月二十四日假　波同鄕會召開成立大會，凡蘇浙皖三省及京滬二市各地區　業同業公會，皆須加入為聯合會會員。</p>

<h3>哀哉！殖民帝國英國的將來</h3>
<p>— 秋風</p>
<p>因為這一次的戰爭，英國不得不淪為三箏國，這已成為一般的常識了。著名的文明批評家威廉。楊格（一八六〇年生）發表一文，題為：「英國的將來」，他預言英國在二十一世紀，將淪為二千萬人口左右和荷蘭一樣的小國，他的見解是這樣：英國之所以能成為世界的强國，乃因受惠於一時的特殊條件，然此項良好條件目下已經消失，無數的實源輿無限的人口，亦將次第減少，最近英政府當局對於此項增加人口為當務之急，然而增加人口完全是不可能的事，但是英國成了僅右少教人口的小國，也不要緊，間境產止半頓，莎士比亞，密爾翌的時俠，還是小國時代的英國，英國即使再成為和荷蘭一樣的小國，但是祇要能　產生這樣優越的人物，而對世界文化有所實戲那又何必悲戰呢？這一段論文，所以能引起我們的興趣者，就是　格，此到英同的沒萬會運，是由於必然的力量所導致的，所以把勢必戰敗來做立論的前提，這也看得出英國的沒落是無可挽囘的了，其原文刊於倫敦的「兩遍評論（Portnightly）」五月號，以卷首論文的地位發表，以下即為其譯文：</p>
<p>趨向衰敗之途的的農業</p>
<p>最初的衰敗，就是英國農業的破產，這在一八七八年前後就已明瞭了。發表　　的全張也似乎在這時候。前世紀之問急激地上昇的實際工資，在第一次大戰之前的十五年問就已停止。戰後的恢復，在遭遇一九二九年的不景氣之前，期待甚殷，但這打擊英國實在受不下。英國早已不是世界的工塲了。勞動者拿了很高的工資，但他們做　種有限的工作。我們以　大的資金貸給外國使創工廠。的確，這些貸金所產生的利息，在維持其程度的決算上很右幫助，但這資金現在已完全償淸了。英國不能不像輪出，裝品一樣，越過錢爭國的關我壁壘，把不能代替鑛物輸出海外，以　求　養現在膨服中的人口食糧。即使把他國之經濟的國家主義置之度外，英國的國外貿易，因負擔了高昻的生產費和龐大的人口，而昭於麻痺狀態。要使以前的顧客恢復他們的購買力，還須很長的時間吧！</p>
<p>人口增加無望</p>
<p>英國現在的人口，是由於特殊的條件所勝生的。這條件紫已　失了，但減低生活水準，果能雜持這人口嗎？人口的增加是由於經濟的法則決定的，　凱爾·魯勃茲在一西洋的復活」一書中，主張大不列顛的人口，常應適合每人的實際平均收入額而增減。我想更在　茲所著的書中引用如次一段</p>
<p>歐洲變成世界歷史上空前的人口獨密地帶，這人口習慣於比較高的生活水準。歐洲不能自給自足，在那裏現在我們遭遇到唯一的危險那危險就是歐洲人的生活水準，急激地低落到某種人所視為事實上的飢餓之點。就幾世紀來倒推人類遇步的歷史上的悲劇看來、這大概是容許人口膨脹的一時的良好樣件，或由於自然之力，或由於人類的手，而突然停此的塲合，所起的一種反動。</p>
<p>英國沒落的必然</p>
<p>英帝國是許多國家所組成的聯邦，所以今後用血輿精神或許還能順利地成立英帝國，但或許不能，也未可知。英語國家全體集合起來組成一聯盟，並不是不可能的，但在這聯盟中，美國將是為得勞吧！我們所呼號的產業主義的時代，顯然已經吿終了。於是我們在歐洲作為一强國的地位，也跟着一同喪失了，在以後的百年間，我們將復歸於麽業革命以前的英國。我們恐將變成擁有二千萬的人口，而過着自給自足的生活。總結的說來，我懷着很多的務望，眺望未來，當然，在那過渡時期，不能不是痛苦的。但我們現在如不能抑制不正直的煽動政治家們，期民主主義將在最後的避難所中毀滅吧！</p>
<p>國民論壇</p>
<h3>除惡務盡</h3>
<p>— 黃炎</p>
<p>古老的中國，經不住英美人百年來的侵蝕茶毒，致陷於個破壞敗落的境地，雖自大東亞戰爭爆發後，其大部份惡勢力已被掃蕩殆盡，但以其流毒之深，業已滲入骨髓，因此在社會文化方面還留有不少的積弊餘毒，一時尚不易洗　干淨。際此中日兩國在騙逐英美惡勢力目標下並肩邁進之時，語曰：「樹德務　，除惡務盡」此種積弊實有予以盤根錯節，澈底肅淸的必要。茲就管見所及，略述數端如下：</p>
<p>以中文代英文</p>
<p>掮着「介紹科學」為文化　略幌子的英文：近世以來，幾有喧賓奪主，把中國　有文字，予以拼斥的趨勞。無論各大機關，銀行，商店，……對於戰員們本國文程度如何？大多略而不加深究，但對於英文程度的要求，却大都鄭重萬事；甚至而述負着教育奮任的各學校（一班所謂「教會學校」更不必說）不但把英文列入為最重要科目之一，有些，竟連一個初級小學三四年級的學生，竟已硬要他們受着英文英語的訓練。道一種措施，難這說定要教中國人世世代代下表，再學做英美人的奴隸不成嗎？中國是有它固右底文字的，果然，它或者有着種種缺點，組這祇能　它內在的揚棄，却決不允許　英文來代營。曾見計多黃臉孔，低　子的「同胞」，在相互表示意思的時候，多喜棄中國的話文不用，而用英文英語奈代替，例如在二人分別時，明明可以說「再見！」，但却定要說「Good　Bye！」等等。這種過於過視英文的奴化必理，　認為實有加以糾正的必要。為要糾正這種錯　的心理，鄙意以為：</p>
<p>各幾關，銀行。公司，商店，在行文上，慨應以中文為主體。</p>
<p>當局應明令，禁止國人，在日常應用時以英文為書信，談話，或作其他之意思表示。</p>
<p>各學校對教授英文之時問應極度減少。（低級學校學生實無學習英文之必要英文一科；自應加以廢止；一般中等以上勝校亦應盡量減少）（聞華一北各中等以上學校，對英一文課程已改為選科，實撙吾心。）</p>
<p>授課書籍應禁用英文版本。如關於科學，文學上有價值之英文版本，無譯水者，宜由教育部指定種數，擇國人之最需要而最切用者，聘任專家，譯成中文版本後，才得令之閱　。</p>
<p>以上各點，對於其也各外國語文，視情努之需要，在原則上，亦可通用。</p>
<p>剷除思想毒素</p>
<p>中國數千年來的社會文化，一貫地是以儒家思想為中心的。對於商人營利，自所以義利兩字，常是互相協調而不相謬悖的。本來中國人也當以孜孜　利的為「小人」而不予重視。孔子曾說：「君子　於義，小人　於利」。顔囘一單食，一瓢飲，在陋巷；孔子賢之。即如子貢之化殖，　則屢中，然亦非若國人士所重視的。</p>
<p>然自拜金主義及功利主義患思侵入中國後，遂大大地造成了中國今日社會上，一般祇重金錢，不重道義自私自利的惡劣心理。諸如近年以來投機風的猖獗，因爭奪財富而造成骨肉殘殺，兄弟鬩牆……以及祇重衣衫，不或人品，等等，狗眼看人低的勢利，不論直接或間接的，可以說是都受了這種病態心理的流毒。於是使整個社會，重拜金錢，　　道養，面陷於杌隉不安的境地。長此以往，勢必形成猶太人第二。這種現象，自非吾人所能漠視，為此，應設法糾正。在消極方百請，吾以為至少：</p>
<p>應限制富人種種物質上的享受，並强制嚴肅其私生活。</p>
<p>禁止一切享樂塲所（俗稱「消金窟的）之開設，及奢侈品之制造，出售，及使用。</p>
<p>以上兩點如一時不能辦到，至少應以最高或特種稅率抽取其捐稅。</p>
<p>限制商人自由貿易及高利貸。</p>
<p>嚴行加强物資統制配給政策。如有述犯，除科以罰金外更應科以體刑。</p>
<p>規定士義工商……各級人員之服飾及其生活程度。務使其在消費方面至於極低程度（尤其是商人階級及一般縻爛的公務人員的生活方式，更宜注意。）</p>
<p>以上種種，衹就其消極方面而講，至積極方面：</p>
<p>應積極推行新國民逐動。不只是勸導地抑且要强制地。</p>
<p>提倡正當娛樂，必要時應予以種種便利及鼓勵獎揚或輔助。</p>
<p>對士，農，工，三　人員中之淸高孤苦，而確努力於其木位工作，及右成續者，政府應予以名譽上及物質上之獎助。務使其不因饑寒所迫而離其崗位。間時藉可免被一般富有者所蔑視。</p>
<p>凡此種種，皆就其原則而言，總之，務使金錢的運用右所限制，更使共萬能的效用，有時而窮上俾無貝之才，勝於有員之財。在初拜金主義者的動機和目的衹是想積儲金錢，以足其所需之一切慾望，茍能如此，我想至少已可使「貧者無羨慕之心，而作非分之想；富者無驕奢之念，而杜淫慾之萌。」從此，拜金主義及功利主義思想，在中國人底心域中，或可己無作祟的餘地了！</p>
<p>形式上的改革</p>
<p>西裝的改革和領帶的廢止——說起四奘，人人會稱道它的便利，但西裝領帶，我始終以為那是一種贅瘤，是一種「文明的桎梏」。譬如以經濟言，費了幾元幾十元去買上這東西，實在太不合算。每天又為了要把它弄得整齊，筆挺。所以還要費去不少的時間。再就實用而言。那在服飾上並不一定需要。即就美觀來講，那也並不一定美麗，因為美醜是相對的，誰敢說右了一根領帶一定會比沒右的美呢？所以，我認為領帶實是服飾上一種多餘的東西。物料的獲得是這樣地艱難，一絲一縷自應倍加珍貴，思其來處不易。與其費了寳貴的物料和人工去做成這麽一件並不需要的東西；還不如將之移為他用，使增加於必需品之生產上力為國家多增加一分原氣。所以，西裝的領帶我認為實有加以廢止的必要。</p>
<p>領帶廢止以後，西裝自當改其式樣，在質的方面講，則不必定要什麽英國，或美國製的呢絨。在式樣和便利上講，那總理所定的「中山裝」或「學生裝」，賓是取其所長而捨其所短的好服式。當局丞可明令，制定為中國的國民服務使全國一體遵後。孔子說：「衛管仲，看其披髮左袵矣。」英美已是吾們的敵人，西裝是英美人常穿的股裝，我們遺要學穿敵人的服裝幹嗎？</p>
<p>高跟鞋的廢止——女子的高跟鞋，我認為同樣的是「文明的桎梏」。是歐美人染給我們的縛東。我會聽到見到過許許多多摩登的女同胞們，會為了力爭自由而掙扎奮鬥。自從禁止女子纏足以後，女子的足部可以說已得到了自由解放。但自從高跟鞋流行以後，那班所謂力爭女子自由的摩登女同胞們，軍起效尤的竟是不少，結果遂使自己重又陷入了苦疼而不自由的深淵裏。眞的，難道說：「摩登也者，就祇這麽影式上的一點嗎？」護得了的自由，難道說又自甘放棄嗎？</p>
<p>以上數端，諒來還不致是「因噎廢食」吧！深願大家能羣　羣力，力肅積弊，盡洗餘毒。輸以新的血液，護新的中國能早些康　建設起來。</p>

<h3>Expectations for Youth Movement Leaders</h3>
<p>The current state is that the Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage, nearing dawn and success. However, striving for dawn and success is not an easy task that can be achieved without effort, nor is it a matter of fatalism where success is guaranteed. Rather, it depends on the united power of our one billion people of Asia, working diligently to achieve it. This must not only be clearly understood but also thoroughly practiced. In this regard, without offering flattery, our ally Japan truly understands and practices this, and is making efforts from all aspects. As long as a department can play a partial role, no effort is spared to promote it equally, gathering each part to form the whole, and each force to create a total force. Not to mention distant examples, recent ones are sufficient to illustrate this. For example, the Greater East Asia Conference is the union of a large Asian group, discussing the common goal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Greater East Asia National Assembly unites all the people of Greater East Asia to rise up. The Greater East Asia Youth Leaders Conference, which will begin on the 12th, aims to awaken the unity and effort of youth throughout Asia. All of these events are centered around Japan, inviting various countries and ethnic groups to participate and discuss together.</p>
<p>China has sent representatives to each of these conferences. For the Greater East Asia Youth Leaders Conference, Mr. Lin Bosheng, Secretary-General of the New Citizen Movement Promotion Committee and Director-General of Youth Corps, and Mr. Xu Xiqing, Deputy Director of the Central Youth Cadre School, will attend. Mr. Lin is one of the responsible leaders for youth in China. He will surely gain something from this conference. In particular, Japan has a relatively solid foundation for youth movements, which can be used as a reference for us, and we can also examine and learn from it.</p>
<p>The youth era is the morning sun of life, with the courage of spring thunder and raging waves, and the sincere passion of innocence. Courage is easily impulsive, and passion is easily expressed. Therefore, things that are worth singing and weeping about, and things that are worthy of praise and lament, are most easily expressed. If correct guidance and appropriate training can be applied, a force that cannot be underestimated can be generated. However, precisely because of the fervent courage and passion unique to youth, it is most difficult to control. But due to the immaturity of life experience, the lack of firmness in will, and the incomplete understanding of the current situation, correct guidance can easily mold them. Therefore, leading the youth movement is the most difficult thing, difficult because youth have strong but immature courage and passion, which are not easily controlled. But training youth is the easiest thing, easy because youth have not yet been corrupted by the world and their nature is inherently good, making them easy to mold. Those engaged in the youth movement should grasp this point first. As for the main points of guidance, we would like to offer some humble suggestions:</p>
<p>First, leaders should prioritize the cultivation of healthy physical bodies for youth. The success of any learning or career, regardless of scale, is rooted in a strong physique. And a strong physique must be established in youth for future use. As the saying goes, "If you don't work hard when you're young, you'll regret it when you're old." Our predecessors used this to caution about learning and career, but we believe it is even more appropriate to use it for physical training. Because with a strong physique, even if you haven't worked hard on learning and career when you're young, you can still make up for it when you're old. However, if you don't cultivate your health when you're young, even if you have learning and career, you will inevitably be powerless and unable to contribute to the world when you're old.</p>
<p>Second, leaders must provide extremely accurate instructions on the international situation and the dynamics and policies of domestic politics and economy, so that youth have an extremely accurate understanding. This is the training of thought. Indeed, a sound body and a sound mind are the two most basic elements of life, and special emphasis should be placed on youth, who are entrusted with the fate of the nation and the transformation of society.</p>
<p>As for technical training, we will discuss it later. There is one more point that youth movement leaders should pay attention to: all words and actions of the leader must be consistent inside and out, serving as a model. The model shown should impact the perceptions of the youth. With this kind of youth guidance, success can be expected in the near future.</p>
<h3>President Wang's Broadcast in Japan: Expressing a Firm Belief, Striving to Carry Out the War and Complete Construction</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – Wang, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government of China, recently gave a broadcast speech to foreign countries on the significance of the Greater East Asia Conference and his feelings about attending the conference at the Tokyo Central Broadcasting Corporation. Regarding China's determination to complete the Greater East Asia War, he said the following: "I am deeply honored to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference, which has great significance in world history. During the meeting, I listened to Prime Minister Tojo's great theories and personally received the high opinions of representatives from various countries, which deepened my admiration. Looking back over the past hundred years, Britain and the United States have willfully pursued their policies of aggression and extortion, and their insatiable ambitions to devour the world. Britain's efforts began by extending to the Nanyang region, then to China, which led to the Opium War. The United States also invaded East Asia from the Pacific, joining forces with Britain to form a pincer attack. At that time, the nations of East Asia were on the verge of crisis. Fortunately, Japan rose up alone and was able to stop the ambitions of Britain and the United States. However, even after suffering this blow, Britain and the United States did not dare give up their ambitions, and devoted themselves to sowing discord among the nations of East Asia, causing them to fight each other almost daily. When the Greater East Asia War began, the power of Britain and the United States in East Asia collapsed. Britain and the United States' gains from aggression and extortion, and their attempts, were completely overturned by Japan. Therefore, all the nations of Greater East Asia cannot help but admire Japan's contributions to protecting East Asia. Furthermore, Japan believes that the harm done by Britain and the United States to East Asia is entirely due to their policies of aggression and extortion. Therefore, after militarily driving out the forces of Britain and the United States, it further sought to reduce their traditional policies, replacing aggression with co-existence, and replacing extortion with mutual enjoyment, allowing the nations of East Asia to be independent and autonomous, and to mutually support each other's independence and autonomy. In terms of culture, it promotes their creativity and creativity. In terms of economy, it implements mutual benefit, supplementing each other's strengths and weaknesses, and trading what they have for what they lack. This basic policy is the opposite of the traditional policies of Britain and the United States. This is the difference between the spirit of Eastern morality and the utilitarian thinking of the West. This Greater East Asia Conference was initiated by Japan, uniting the countries of East Asia, using the power of unity and promoting the spirit of morality. This great achievement is not only the foundation for the lasting friendship of the countries of Greater East Asia, but also the foundation for lasting peace in the world. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, truly said that Japan's Restoration is the turning point for Asia. This statement has been confirmed today. Dr. Sun's advocacy of Pan-Asianism, and his hope that Japan would assist China in abolishing unequal treaties, has also been materialized here. A few days ago, I signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with the Japanese Ambassador to China. Today, I represent the Republic of China in attending the Greater East Asia Conference and signing the Joint Declaration. I feel deeply honored. I firmly believe that the representatives of all countries participating in the conference share the same enthusiasm and belief. Therefore, I firmly believe that the purpose of the Greater East Asia War can be achieved, and the construction of Greater East Asia can be completed. However, completing the above objectives and tasks depends on the individual and collective efforts of the countries and nations of East Asia. Japan, as an advanced country, has exerted its greatest strength to protect East Asia, and only expects our newly emerging countries and countries hoping for revival to do their best and share the responsibility of carrying out the war and completing the construction. The bright and brilliant cause of Greater East Asia can only be completed through the separate and joint efforts of the countries and nations of Greater East Asia. The policies of aggression and extortion previously used by Britain and the United States have been defeated, and their policies of sowing discord have also vanished. In the future, no matter what policies they use, any sweet words or empty promises, or the spread of rumors, will not shake our beliefs. We will no longer be oppressed or deceived by them. We are confident that the separate and joint efforts of the countries of Greater East Asia will liberate Greater East Asia and make the brilliance of Greater East Asia shine on the world. Hereby, I would like to pay the greatest respect to our ally Japan and all friendly nations.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Zhang Returned to Manchuria Yesterday Afternoon, Gave a Broadcast Speech in Tokyo Before Departure</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Information Office of the Manchurian government announced on the 8th that Prime Minister Zhang returned to Xinjing from Tokyo on the afternoon of the 8th, having completed his mission to attend the Greater East Asia Conference.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Zhang of Manchuria gave a broadcast speech at the Tokyo Central Broadcasting Corporation at 10:00 AM on the 8th, entitled "Striving for the Glory of Final Victory with Determined Unity." The following is a summary of his speech:</p>
<p>I am deeply honored to have attended the Greater East Asia Conference as a representative of Manchuria and to have signed the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Here, I would like to tell all my compatriots in Greater Asia that the countries of East Asia with brilliant cultures and traditions once entered the thorny path of humiliation and submission, suffering the aggression and exploitation of Britain and the United States, becoming their sacrifices and slaves. At this time, only Japan, carrying the great joy of the Meiji Restoration, resisted their oppression and maintained the honor of autonomous development. Looking back on the crimes committed by Britain and the United States in East Asia, they are too numerous to enumerate. To satisfy their material desires, they used all means to enslave the nations of East Asia under the beautiful name of civilization, implementing various policies of aggression in material and spiritual ways. At this time, the entire East Asian nation suffered the tyranny of Britain and the United States. Although the enlightened patriots truly fought for the revival of East Asia, shedding blood and sacrificing themselves, the countries of East Asia failed to break the feudal malpractices that had accumulated over the years, and failed to unite, eventually being taken advantage of by the aggression of Britain and the United States, who acted as they pleased. Our Manchuria rose suddenly amidst the chaos in East Asia. With the assistance of Japan and the support of 40 million people, we engaged in construction. After ten years of effort, Manchuria has become a modern nation, promoting a new order. Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, the power of Britain and the United States in East Asia has been swept away, and the East Asian regions that had been reduced to colonies have been restored to their original states. For example, the integrity of Chinese sovereignty, the adjustment of Thai territory, the independence of Burma, the independence of the Philippines, and the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, and the participation of indigenous people in the Dutch East Indies in politics, are all worthy of permanent commemoration in the history of East Asia and cannot be forgotten. I deeply believe that such a great construction, realized amidst the smoke and rain of heroic martyrs, is due to Japan's unwavering conviction and strong practical ability, and I express my deep respect. Furthermore, the nations and ethnic groups of East Asia have now been awakened by East Asian self-consciousness, filled with the fervent will of "returning to our East Asian essence," and I am even more delighted. This surge of the East Asian spirit, this creation of a new world, is an inevitable trend of natural law that cannot be hindered by anything. It is unlikely that anyone in East Asia is indifferent to this joy. Even those in the inner regions of Britain and the United States will surely feel a sense of resonance in their hearts. Even the 400 million people of India groaning under the tyrannical rule of Britain, looking up to this new world, cannot help but express great sympathy for their own fate. During this conference, I personally met with representatives of allied nations, sincerely revealed my heart, and discussed the mission of building East Asia. I was deeply moved by the determination to complete the war and the enthusiasm for construction. Our solemn declaration to the world is a great and righteous cause that does not shame us before heaven and earth. This is by no means the Atlantic Charter agreed upon by Britain and the United States, merely creating a beautiful name for peace and a hypocritical mask of humanity, while eagerly seeking to maintain their own interests.</p>
<h3>Burmese Deputy Prime Minister Declares: War Preparations Completed - Unsparingly Offering All Assistance to India -</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) - Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Kin Maung Gyee issued a statement on the Greater East Asia Conference on the 6th, strongly stating that the Greater East Asia Conference was an unprecedented conference in East Asia and that the conference has fully demonstrated that the fate of the East Asian nations is completely in the hands of Greater Asia. The main points are as follows: This conference is truly a new page in the history of the new East Asia. The nations of East Asia have hereby established their national right to pioneer their own destiny. Furthermore, the conference has strengthened the solidarity of the East Asian countries in fighting their common enemy, and the Burmese people's trust in Japan has become even firmer. During the conference, the representatives of the various countries fully exchanged opinions on the war issue to determine a comprehensive and unified policy for all of East Asia. Therefore, there is absolutely no concept of an anti-Axis camp in East Asia, and the chaotic state of fighting will not occur. This is what the Burmese government firmly believes. This conference explains that the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has achieved a great success. After gaining independence, Burma is determined to make thorough efforts in the struggle to liberate East Asia. The reason why we have this determination is that we deeply know that we must unite, otherwise we will perish. Therefore, Burma, today, when the people of India hope for assistance, is unsparingly offering all assistance, standing up to challenge Britain and the United States. Burma has completed its various war preparations, and its national institutions have been strengthened to the extent that they can overcome any difficulties.</p>
<h3>Building East Asia's Process: Creating a New Era of Historical Facts, Konoe Praises the Grand Meeting of Six Nations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Former Japanese Prime Minister Duke Fumimaro Konoe issued a statement on the 7th, praising the fundamental concept of Greater East Asian coexistence and co-prosperity, and commending the grand occasion of the Greater East Asia Conference. The gist of his statement is: Now, all the bases where Britain and the United States carried out their exploitation in Greater East Asia have been completely lost. Burma and the Philippines have successively declared their independence, and the Provisional Government of Free India, the glorious freedom of the Indonesian nation, has also been established. Greater East Asia has presented a magnificent spectacle unprecedented in history. Furthermore, the National Government of the Republic of China's return to Nanjing cannot but be said to be a pioneer in the liberation and revival of Greater East Asia. The National Government cherishes deep friendships with the various countries and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, especially with our country, sharing weal and woe and even being committed to living and dying together, and has also declared war on Britain and the United States. Now, witnessing its fate advance, completing the Greater East Asia War, we hereby express our sincere respect. The grand ideal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can only be fully realized and permanently developed if it is based on an enduring and undiminished victory and glory. We must work together in the greatest mission, which lies in trusting and supporting each other, strengthening our war efforts, and striving to defeat Britain and the United States as soon as possible. This six-nation conference can be called a new era in the process of building a new order in Greater East Asia. I pray for the future of Greater East Asia with fervent enthusiasm.</p>

We will reject the sports philosophy of Britain and the United States, and exert all our efforts to strengthen the physique of our people. In order to achieve consistent results in national sports, the countries of Greater East Asia should establish a Greater East Asia sports organization under new guiding principles, and use this organization as the foundation for a future world sports organization.</p>

This kind of determination and enthusiasm is the driving force to complete the Greater East Asia War. The conference ended successfully in an atmosphere of peace, and the unanimous adoption of the Greater East Asia Declaration further proves that the spirit and interests of the Greater East Asian countries are completely consistent. Compared with the meetings or conferences of the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, they try their best to seek unity in inconsistency because their interests are inconsistent, which is ridiculous and can be said to be sleeping in the same bed with different dreams. If there is a saying of sleeping in the same bed with the same dream, then the unity of East Asian countries is in line with this saying. The results of the conference have been seen in the five principles of the Common Declaration, namely: Greater East Asia's coexistence and co-prosperity; autonomy, independence, and amity; promoting East Asian culture; economic cooperation and prosperity; and contributing to world progress. These five principles are the common mission of the countries of Greater East Asia and can also be said to be the fundamental principles for promoting world peace. It can be asserted that due to the successful conclusion of the Greater East Asia Conference, the nations of Greater East Asia will become more united and complete the Greater East Asia Holy War. At the same time, the foundation for the construction of Greater East Asia has also been laid. Furthermore, due to the establishment of the five major principles, the common ideals of the Greater East Asian countries have been proclaimed to the universe. We firmly believe that the East Asian nations will definitely strive to move towards this common ideal and achieve their common goals.</p>
<h3>US Decides to Merge Chongqing Air Force</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Chongqing military spokesperson's announcement on the 5th, the Chongqing Air Force has decided to be incorporated into the US 14th Air Force stationed in Chongqing, under the command of its commander, General Chennault. Reportedly, when the US air force stationed in China was reorganized last July, the authorities of the US Air Force Command stationed in Chongqing had already applied to the United States, requesting the Chongqing side to incorporate its air force. Only recently did it succeed, and it was officially decided to incorporate the Chongqing Air Force into the US Air Force stationed in China. In the future, the Chongqing Air Force will be trained in the United States or by the 10th Air Force in India, and then will be incorporated into the 14th Air Force. Therefore, the ambition of the US Air Force to merge the Chongqing Air Force has been successful.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Convenes Subordinates to Hold a Discussion Meeting</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - In order to understand the work situation of the various agencies under the Ministry of Industry, and for the purpose of promoting and guiding future work plans, the Ministry of Industry convened the heads of its subordinate agencies at 8:30 AM on the 8th in the Ministry's auditorium to hold a discussion meeting.

<h3>National Government Declaration of War</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Great East Asia War on December 8th two years ago, the National Government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared that it would share weal and woe with its friendly neighbor, Japan. Since then, it has embarked on a new national movement, engaged in safeguarding security and improving people's livelihoods, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and others continue to use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and are becoming more and more outrageous, even colluding with elements of the Chongqing faction to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill East Asians. Recently, as their violence has been successively defeated by the friendly Japanese army, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have been lost, they have become even more cunning. They are jealous of the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the pro-National Government, and are constantly instigating elements of the Chongqing faction to harass them in order to hinder the progress of various constructions. Importantly, they use their own aircraft, based on the Chongqing faction, to bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The Chongqing faction elements, willingly accepting the instigation of Britain and the United States and acting as traitors to East Asia, are certainly shameful. However, Britain and the United States, with their deliberate efforts for East Asia, are doing their best to provoke and sow discord, in order to achieve their ambition of dominance. This is especially the enemy that the East Asian nation should hate. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States. It will do its utmost to cooperate with its friendly neighbor Japan to sweep away the violence of Britain and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. Both Manchuria and Thailand have long been friendly and share a common understanding of the East Asian situation. In the future, they should seek cooperation in order to jointly establish a new East Asian order based on morality. The friendly countries of Germany and Italy have been maneuvering against the forces of Britain and the United States in the West for many years and have repeatedly won victories. My country is now participating in the Great East Asia War and should echo them in order to contribute to the just new order of the entire world. All my countrymen should take this as a meeting of the times to realize the Great Asianism of the Father of the Nation, the revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of Greater East Asia, and the achievement of world peace. With one heart and one mind, and with the strength of war from beginning to end, they should implement this great mission of the era.</p>

<h3>Japanese Air Force Commander Talks About Air Battle Near Jiujiang</h3>
<p>Around 12:00 noon on the 30th, eight elite US Air Force planes stationed in Chongqing came to attack the Jiujiang area of Central China, using machine guns to strafe ships anchored in the suburbs of Jiujiang and nearby. However, they were fiercely attacked by the elite Japanese fighter planes waiting at the front-line base, and a great victory was achieved by shooting down five of them. Regarding the fierce battle between the new elite fighter planes of the enemy and us that took place near Jiujiang, a certain commander spoke as follows:</p>
<p>Commanding from a Height</p>
<p>At 〇:〇 minutes, departing from the base and entering the airspace near Jiujiang at an altitude of one thousand meters, I saw twin-engine fighters, which are called "fast" in the US Air Force, formed into a line with two planes per row, intending to attack from a height of 〇 thousand meters. At this time, the Japanese fighter planes were all in an advantageous position at an altitude of 〇 thousand meters. Commanding from a height, we fired fiercely. Some burst into flames and fell after one shot, while others escaped from a low altitude, crashing into high mountains, with the fuselage bursting into flames, and the whole plane crashing. There were also those whose fuselage caught fire, and they parachuted into the lake or the Yangtze River. It was extremely gratifying.</p>
<p>Shooting Down Half</p>
<p>However, some of the enemy planes were also full of fighting spirit. Regardless of the artillery fire in front, they took a posture of bravely rising rapidly from below to counterattack. Such resistance from the enemy planes has not been seen before. However, the so-called new model plane, which the enemy boasted about, was eventually shot down by more than half of the attacking planes in an air battle of one or two minutes. The places of crash were: two planes on Chengmen Lake, one of which saw the pilot descending into the lake with a parachute; one plane near Ertao Kou; and one plane each in Ruichang and the mountains of Chaishan, one of which saw it falling while burning. We calmly watched from the plane and safely returned to the base. (翔: Translated from the November 2nd issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Argentina Expresses Strict Neutrality</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Recently, due to the US government's measures to block funds from Argentine banks and other oppressive measures, various parties have paid close attention to the attitude of the Argentine government. Recently, the new Argentine Foreign Minister stated his foreign policy to a Chilean reporter, saying that the Argentine government's foreign policy is still strict neutrality. Argentina does not want to be an enemy of any country. There are also countries in Europe that adopt a neutral policy, so there is naturally nothing wrong with Argentina adopting a neutral policy suitable for the Argentine people. Argentina is willing to be friends with anyone, but those who hinder Argentina's prestige and infringe on its independence will be regarded as enemies. From the remarks of the new Argentine Foreign Minister, it can be seen that Argentina has always adhered to its neutral policy.</p>
<h3>Heavy Troops Gather in Kyiv, Becoming the Center of the Battle; Fierce Fighting in the Northeast of Kou Xu</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - As the situation on the Crimean Peninsula became serious, the German army retreated from Wofu, an important point on the upper reaches of the Homburg River, which caused the eastern front to become urgent. Now, the German military authorities explain the battle situation in various important theaters as follows: "Kyiv Area" The center of the battle on the eastern front is still in the Kyiv area. Currently, the Soviet army is about to launch a fierce attack on the German army with about sixteen infantry divisions and three tank groups north and northwest of the city. After fierce fighting between the German and Soviet armies, 73 of their tanks were destroyed and 71 of their planes were shot down. On the 5th, they retreated to the predetermined positions in the rear. On the 6th, the Soviet army continued to attack fiercely, advancing and retreating north and west of Kyiv, and the battle was extremely fierce. On the 6th, the Soviet army also launched a partial attack in the southeast of Kyiv, but it failed. "Kou Xu Area" The Soviet army used powerful troops to fiercely attack the German army in the hilly area northeast of the Kou Xu Isthmus, and the two armies fought fiercely. The Soviet army attempted to break through the German army's positions by passing through the swampy area, but as a result, they were severely damaged and retreated. "Bele Kop Area" The German army launched a counterattack at the Bele Ko Shan Isthmus, the throat of the Crimean Peninsula, defeating the Soviet army's attempt to break through. However, the Soviet army is still actively reinforcing troops, and tank and infantry units are attempting to continue to attack the German army. The Soviet army launched more than 20 fierce attacks on the German army from the direction of Bieleslavl, south of Kyiv, but the German army's positions remained unmoved.</p>
<p>Large Tank Battle in Nivil West</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency reported: The Soviet army won a full victory in defensive trade on the bend of the Nivil River on Saturday. The German Air Force also made a major contribution to this victory. West of the city, the Soviet army concentrated a powerful tank force and infantry force, intending to enter the German army's line and tear apart the German army's front line, and then launched a fierce tank battle. The German artillery detachment also participated in the battle. In a powerful counterattack, the German army finally defeated the Soviet army's offensive and inflicted extremely heavy losses on the enemy in terms of manpower and materials. By evening, 52 Soviet tanks had been destroyed on the battlefield. German fighter planes shot down 20 Soviet planes in the sky above the area. Therefore, the Soviet army lost a total of 91 planes on Saturday. The battles in the northern part of the eastern front are limited to the activities of the Shufeng south of Lake Ladoga. The Soviet infantry attacked twice under the cover of artificial fog, and both times collapsed in front of the defensive artillery fire of the German army's main line.</p>
<p>The Soviet Army Reinforces the Throat of Ke Dao</p>
<p>South of Kou Xu and north along the highlands along the Crimean coast, the German army engaged in fierce battles with the superior Soviet army. German bombers and Stoga planes participated in the battle and achieved great results, causing serious losses to the enemy army. At the northern exit of the Crimean Peninsula, smaller Soviet units were blocked or annihilated by the German army, or forced to retreat. The gap that the Soviet army broke through at Bele Ko Title Head the day before has been reduced by the German and Romanian armies, and attempts to make new breakthroughs have been suppressed. North of the lower reaches of the Humber River, the German armored infantry and tanks attacked an area occupied and heavily defended by the Soviet army, recovered a village, and captured 40 enemy medium and heavy artillery pieces, as well as many other weapons. One infantry division of the enemy was annihilated or captured. The Soviet army's offensive in the Niepa River was quite smooth. A large Soviet battalion was surrounded and annihilated.</p>
<p>All Soviet Iron Factories Become Ruins</p>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to the Moscow correspondent of the London Times: A group of Soviet technicians who recently returned from the Don River front spoke about the German army's destruction tactics, saying that almost no factory in the southern iron industry zone of European Soviet territory was spared from destruction by the German army. When the German army retreated, it destroyed all the machinery and equipment of the factories, such as iron smelting furnaces and cranes, and made it impossible to repair them again. Therefore, although the Soviet army has recovered various places, they are all nothing but ruins.</p>
<h3>The Three Great Powers, Rumored to be Meeting: Soviet Foreign Minister to Visit England</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Central News Agency dispatch from the capital, dated the 8th. According to Washington sources: there are many symbolic indications regarding the plan for a Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin conference. The general opinion is that the date and location of the meeting have already been decided, and the meeting will be held in an unexpected location, but due to censorship, no preparatory news can be obtained. However, indications from various sources have led to the conclusion that the meeting will take place.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Central News Agency dispatch from the capital, dated the 8th. According to the Stockholm Daily News, citing London diplomatic sources: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is about to arrive in London to participate in the formal establishment of the Three-Power Commission.</p>
<p>Turkey's Attitude Toward the Situation: Maintaining a Cautious Stance; Cairo Talks Conclude</p>
<p>Ankara, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. According to Egyptian capital sources: the talks held in Cairo between British Foreign Secretary Eden and Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu concluded yesterday. British Foreign Secretary Eden traveled to Cairo specifically for these talks with the Turkish Foreign Minister after the Moscow talks.</p>
<p>Istanbul, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. Since the 5th, British Foreign Secretary Eden and Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu have begun talks in Cairo. On the 6th, they visited Egyptian King Farouk VIII one after the other. The talks are still being conducted in secret. There is only speculation about the content of the talks, but no definite news.</p>
<p>Ankara, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. According to the Reuter news agency: Turkish newspapers commenting on the talks between Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu and British Foreign Secretary Eden unanimously advocate a cautious approach, and that decisions should not be agreed upon hastily. As the "Evkaf Yurdu" newspaper put it, "There is no reason to participate in a war" that would only lead to bloodshed and sacrifice for the country.</p>
<p>Rumor of an Understanding Between Britain and Turkey</p>
<p>Stockholm, Central News Agency dispatch from the capital, dated the 8th. According to the "Stockholm Daily News," citing "Sunday Express" sources: the result of the diplomatic discussions between Britain and Turkey in Cairo has led to an understanding. Turkey will cede strong strategic locations to Britain, but the formal establishment of this cession understanding will be based on the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1939. Turkey has also proposed exchange conditions, including new loans and more wartime materials, with airfields being the main ceded areas. The report also stated that the Anglo-Turkish understanding also includes the passage of Allied troops through Turkey.</p>
<p>Turkey Desires Peace</p>
<p>Ankara, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. Political and diplomatic circles in the Turkish capital are currently anticipating the results of the ongoing Cairo conference between British Foreign Secretary Eden and Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu with nervous emotions. These individuals are paying particular attention to the news of the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, traveling from the United States to Cairo by special plane. Well-informed political circles believe that Turkey will be presented with the issue of entering the war, which has been repeatedly delayed since the outbreak of hostilities. Reuters' diplomatic correspondent clearly stated on Thursday evening that Turkey is prepared to make the greatest sacrifices regarding the outcome of the war. The theme hinted at by Reuters is sufficient to influence Turkish public opinion. According to Reuters, the purpose of the Cairo conference is noteworthy as it marks the first time the British side has publicly raised the possibility that Turkey will be asked to participate in the war. The Turkish side has lodged a serious protest against the British claim that Turkey has gradually transitioned from a non-belligerent state to active participation. The Turkish side has repeatedly stated that Turkey desires a rapid end to the war, but has no intention of joining the conflict. Since the beginning of the war, Britain has built various airfields throughout Turkey. Regarding this point, the Turkish side has consistently emphasized that this step is purely a defensive preparation made by Turkey based on its foreign policy of self-defense. Qualified political figures in Ankara, given Britain's attitude towards Portugal and the Azores, anticipate similar actions towards Turkey. British diplomacy intends to use the Azores Islands incident as a precedent to argue to Turkey that it does not need to completely abandon neutrality, but can cede naval and air bases to the Allies or allow the Soviet Union the right to transit troops. British diplomatic circles have declared that this is the minimum contribution that Turkey can make within the scope of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement. It is generally believed here that the Allies will make more specific demands on Turkey in the future.</p>
<h3>German Planes Heavily Attack Convoys in the Mediterranean; German Forces in Southern Italy Counterattack</h3>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. The German Führer's headquarters issued a special communiqué on the 7th, stating: The German Air Force inflicted another major blow on enemy transport ships and supply ships in the Western Mediterranean. German dive bombers, flying low over the North African coast, attacked an enemy convoy composed of 22 troop-laden transport ships and 8 destroyers, dropping powerful bombs and torpedoes, hitting 13 enemy ships totaling 140,000 tons, as well as 2 destroyers. The returning bomber crews witnessed several enemy transport ships burning and sinking, with thousands of young British and American soldiers and the destroyed ships simultaneously buried at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. According to the German News Agency: German troops in southern Italy are intensifying their resistance against numerically superior British and American forces, completing an undeniable victory in defense. German forces launched a concentrated offensive at the Venafro airfield. After thorough artillery preparation, they launched a fierce attack on the British and American assault teams, resulting in the Allied forces being split between Santa Maria Oliveto and Rocca d'Evandro. German forces not only filled a gap from the previous day, but also engaged in fierce combat with enemy grenadiers within the enemy's deployment area. German detachments seized several strategically important high grounds, thereby preventing American reinforcements from reaching the front line and driving them back beyond their original positions. Seven American tanks were destroyed. West of the Volturno River basin, British and American attempts to break through at Vairano failed completely. On the nearby roads and in the mountains, German forces countered the enemy with devastating weapons. Four enemy offensives collapsed under the German barrage. General Clark's U.S. Fifth Army, seeing no chance of success with frontal assaults, attempted to infiltrate the German flanks with small units, but this plan was also thwarted by German forces.</p>
<p>Allied Forces Retreat Again in the Apennine Mountains</p>
<p>In the central Apennines, Canadian and British forces continue to display a cautious attitude. German rear guard units retreated from positions such as Frosinone, Avezzano, and Agnone without making contact with the enemy. In the east, near the Adriatic coast, British forces, under the cover of tanks, launched two strong offensives, but were stopped in front of the German lines. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in fierce fighting. In addition, seventeen British tanks were destroyed by anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft batteries. German fighter-bombers disrupted enemy supply lines east of the Trigno River, as well as British landing operations near Termoli. Two troop carriers were sunk, and three others were damaged. A large fleet of transport vehicles was scattered, and at least seven fully loaded trucks caught fire.</p>
<h3>Seventy-Eight High-Ranking Police Officials in North Africa Dismissed</h3>
<p>Delhi, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. Algiers reports: Seventy-eight high-ranking police officials in French North Africa have been dismissed. These officials were stationed in police stations in Algiers, Oran, Philippeville, and other French North African cities. Among them are the Chief Commissioner of Algiers, Laffargue, and the Chief of Police of Oran, Poujade. It is understood that this move is a political decision by the Algiers Committee.</p>
<h3>Trends in Cultural Circles of China and Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. After the Greater East Asia Conference issued a joint declaration, it caused a great sensation in various East Asian countries. Regarding the "elucidation of cultural principles" contained therein, cultural groups in various countries will also launch corresponding movements separately. The trends of major cultural groups in Japan and literary circles in China are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Japan Literary Patriotic Association has hosted the Greater East Asian Writers Conference twice. It is planned to invite Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam and other countries to participate in the third conference next year. The International Music Committee attached to the Japan Music Culture Association plans to strengthen its internal structure and send performers and music culture critics to various parts of Greater East Asia to promote Japanese music and introduce the music of various countries to Japan. The Japan Art Patriotic Association is planning to formulate concrete plans in order to promote Japanese art and introduce the art works of China, Thailand and other countries to Japan.</p>
<p>On the Chinese side, in order to further promote the construction of Greater East Asian literature, a literary organization with the nature of a national writers association will soon emerge. This is a great development in the construction of Greater East Asian literature. It is understood that China has not yet had an organization that encompasses writers from across the country. Now, with the advancement of the times, it is necessary to unite writers from across the country to carry out organized and concrete activities. In response to this need, Zhou Zuoren, Qian Daosun, Shen Qijing, Liu Longguang, Liu Yusheng, Zhang Ziping and others are actively preparing, and it may be established within the year. It is planned that branches will be established in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong and other places. After the establishment of this new organization, in addition to seeking the development of Chinese literature, it will also establish close contact with the Japan Literary Patriotic Association to seek communication between Chinese and Japanese literature.</p>
<h3>Earthquake Recorded by Portuguese Observatory</h3>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th. The Lar Observatory announced: An earthquake occurred at 8:51 on Saturday. The earthquake was estimated to have occurred about 1,600 kilometers away.</p>
<h3>Italy Strengthens Cooperation with Germany</h3>
<p>In the forty days since the German troops marched in, although the situation in Italy has been changing, the overall situation has become more stable, and both the front and the rear show phenomena favorable to the Axis powers.</p>
<p>From a broader perspective, the Anglo-American invasion of mainland Italy can be divided into two stages: the period from the landing in Calabria to the betrayal of the Badoglio regime, and the incursion into the Salerno area and the Termoli region, which led to a genuine conflict between the German and Anglo-American forces. At this time, from the perspective of the so-called Italian defensive warfare, the content of the current battle line is also completely different from the past. That is to say, the Italian army of the past no longer exists. They are now adopting genuine German-style combat and fully exploiting the true value of elastic defense to compensate for the inferiority of weapons and troops. After the battle on the Volturno River, the Apennine Mountains in central Italy have become increasingly treacherous, and it is conceivable that Anglo-American advances will become increasingly difficult in the future. Because rumors rapidly approached Rome with the flames of war, I stayed in Rome only to feel anxious, so I went directly to the battlefield for a pilgrimage. Only after stepping on the firing line did I realize that it was all unnecessary self-disturbance. The German soldiers who were accustomed to fighting and good at conquest, their spirits were excited, shattering our worries.</p>
<p>Some people may ask: So, what if the Anglo-American forces carry out a new landing operation in the rear of the German forces? According to the heads of front-line operations who have fought against the Anglo-American forces so far, this kind of thing will certainly not happen, so they are fighting fiercely with the superior Anglo-American forces.</p>
<p>Germany is of course studying comprehensive measures for this matter, and is preparing to launch a resolute counter-offensive blitzkrieg as soon as the time comes. Even if not, when there is an operational necessity, they are bound to succeed. The fact that the British 8th Army and a part of the US 5th Army were pushed back at once during the fierce battles in Salerno and Eboli in the half month from September 15th in the past is clear evidence.</p>
<p>The Badoglio Regime is Unstable</p>
<p>The eagerness of the British and Americans to open up the battlefield can be seen from the fact that they recognized the Badoglio regime and then declared war on Germany on October 13. The recognition of the Badoglio regime as a collaborator in the attack on Germany by the British, Americans, and Soviets is only a formality, not genuine sincerity. It is even more clear from the fact that the British and Americans brought out Sforza, a well-known exile politician against Badoglio. Although Sforza is now Badoglio's foreign minister, it is rumored that he will take over the post of prime minister and seize power. In short, Badoglio's own political stance is rapidly becoming unstable.</p>
<p>In any case, when Anglo-American aircraft scattered Badoglio's declaration of war against Germany in the sky, the citizens of Rome unanimously expressed their opposition based on the reason that they would be forced to engage in war again under the occupation of the British and Americans, believing that this was the more cruel act of betrayal than Badoglio's announcement of an armistice on September 8 and abandonment of the Triple Alliance. As a result, the Anglo-American-directed Badoglio declaration of war did not win popular support, but made the Badoglio who performed and the Anglo-American who directed greatly lose credibility.</p>
<p>British Use Indian Troops</p>
<p>Information obtained at the front line: The British 8th Army, which supports the Badoglio regime and advances north along the Adriatic coast, is said to have dispatched Indian troops to advance to Larino (30 kilometers northeast of Campobasso). Since the North African War, this Indian 4th Division has fought hard in the fierce battles of Tobruk, Tripoli, and the Mareth Line, and in the final act of the Tunisian War, the Battle of Catania. It is the strongest unit of the British 8th Army. The Sikhs and Gurkhas from Punjab are fearless combat troops. Whenever the headquarters of the 8th Army sends the Indian Division to spearhead an offensive, its meaning is that the battle situation has reached a point that is unfavorable to them.</p>
<p>Indian soldiers who should have fought for the independence of their homeland are actually expeditioning to Italy together with the enemy of their homeland. In this, there lies the cunning manipulation of the British military authorities. Originally, these Indian soldiers, raised on the sugarcane-protected strong liquor of Punjab, after drinking the British whiskey, would suddenly stand up, recklessly rush towards death for no reason, as for the spirit of independence and the love for their homeland, not to mention, they were all thrown into "Java". Their act of drawing their blades towards the German army this time was entirely for the British alcohol.</p>
<p>This is not entirely fabricated; there is evidence. When Rommel's army attacked El Alamein, it was a part of this Indian division that defended the Tobruk fortress until the last moment. After they were abandoned by the British army, because the green light of alcohol had run out, they agreed to the call of the Axis forces and immediately ceased fighting, so German troops were able to easily march into the city. In short, the current battle situation is very difficult, so the British 8th Army...</p>
<p>Rome Becomes a Non-Armed City</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the rear, which reflects this dynamic front, has also returned to absolute tranquility in these forty days. Rome, the holy city for 400 million Catholics worldwide, will also be transformed into an independent national organization administratively, and the plan for a so-called non-armed city is progressing day by day. This is because, at the same time as the German troops marched into Rome, they made clear Germany's respect for the attitude of non-armed cities, and neutral countries such as Spain, Argentina, Portugal, and Switzerland are also enthusiastically supporting this plan. The news that the Vatican authorities have already requested recognition from the warring countries is also believable. Although the content is not clear now, it is probably to make the status of the city of Rome closer to that of a free city, further developed from a non-armed city.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the Vatican, the British are spreading the rumor that the Pope has become a German prisoner, claiming that they will attack Rome to rescue the Pope. This fabricated act has now caused great opposition. Using the sacred and inviolable Pope as war propaganda material has caused great indignation on the Vatican side, and the Vatican's dissatisfaction with the British side has gradually become difficult to conceal.</p>
<p>In short, as the war situation progresses, efforts are being made to keep Rome outside the war circle. Under the control of the German army, at least the peace and order that was "absent" during the Badoglio regime has been restored, and this fact is appreciated by the citizens of Rome. Dramas and music, which had been banned for a long time, have recently been unbanned. Today, a foggy atmosphere that makes people forget the war is gradually taking shape. However, everyone is deeply afraid that a new invader will come to destroy this peace. This is the real situation in Rome.</p>
<p>Whenever American soldiers landing in Italy get drunk and cause trouble in various places, molesting women and causing all kinds of entanglements, the strict discipline of the German army makes people agree even more. Since General Stahel, the commander of the Rome defense, shouted the first slogan, "Germany and Italy should let bygones be bygones and cooperate again!" the new system of cooperation between Germany and Italy has been strengthening and developing at all times.

<h3>Citizens' Air Defense Propaganda Meeting: Held for Three Days Starting Today; Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters Established in the First District Office</h3>

<h3>Deputy Director Su Discusses Issues of Improving Police Administration; Police Treatment Gradually Improved and Unified</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Since the official merger of the First, Third, and West Shanghai Police Bureaus into the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau, Shanghai's police administration has been consolidated. In order to understand the current measures of police administration and the police education issues in the future, this reporter visited Mr. Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the Bureau, yesterday and asked some questions, which were answered in detail. It has been more than two months since the return of the concessions. Under the direction of Mayor Chen and with the cooperation of Allied officials, the police administration has become increasingly sound. From the 1st of this month, the Third and Fourth Shanghai Police Bureaus have been merged, and District 1483 is also managed under the system of the First Police Bureau. The completion of the unification of the police administration can alleviate the infinite pain of the people. In the past, during the time of the two concessions, under the high pressure of British and American forces, the police administration could not be unified, and there were many restrictions. The suffering of the people was not uncommon. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the police administration has been unified, and the Chinese official system has been adopted. From now on, our five million citizens will be able to live and work in peace under a reasonable national police administration. At the same time, the police education issue is also very important, because the police have the most daily contact with the people and can alleviate the difficulties of the people. Therefore, the police should be given strict training in the future to increase their police knowledge, so that they can be loyal and faithful, contribute everything to the country, maintain good local police order, and increase the welfare of the citizens. As Deputy Director, I am in an executive position. I can only carry out the work under the leadership of Mayor Chen and in accordance with Mayor Chen's will, and strive for the improvement of police affairs. Now, I can only bury myself in hard work, obey the guidance of my superiors, work hard at my position, and hope that the advanced figures in society will give me frank guidance. Finally, the reporter asked Mr. Su about the issue of the treatment of staff after the merger of the bureaus. According to his statement, the treatment of police officers in the past was quite inconsistent in the various bureaus. Now that the merger has been completed, it should be improved and unified as much as possible. Moreover, the treatment of the police has a direct impact on the people, but the overall financial problem must also be considered comprehensively. Therefore, the treatment problem is gradually being improved and unified."</p>
<h3>Business and Trade Association Schedules Joint Meeting</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: It is reported that since the mission of purchasing cloth by the Business and Trade Association has been completed, the task of handling cotton products has been transferred to the Cotton Product Review Committee.

The issues of the conclusion of the cotton and cloth purchasing offices and the reorganization of the cotton management offices need to be determined in a unified manner. It is said that it will be submitted to the joint meeting of directors and supervisors to be held on the 10th of this month for discussion and decision.</p>
<h3>Police Authorities Strictly Prohibit Price Gouging on Coal Balls; Rationing Authorities Have Notified Coal Ball Factories</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The black market for coal balls in this city is rampant. Even if citizens pay the black market price, they still cannot buy them, and there is a risk of running out of fuel. According to the Central News Agency reporter's investigation with the rationing authorities of the industry: the source of coal has not been interrupted, and the supply of raw materials to the 22 coal ball factories has not been interrupted, and the price of raw materials has not been raised. Therefore, the current black market is actually caused by general retail coal ball stores. The rationing authorities of the industry have notified the coal ball factories to supervise the retail coal ball stores and prohibit them from illegally raising selling prices privately, otherwise the rationing will be stopped. The general public also hopes that the municipal authorities will quickly issue appropriate measures to maintain the people's livelihood. It is reported that the police authorities have ordered the police to monitor the retail coal ball stores, prohibit private price increases, and crack down on illegal coal ball merchants selling in the middle of the road, and strictly supply citizens in limited quantities at the retail coal ball stores. It is hoped that citizens who are not in urgent need will not compete for storage.</p>

<p>News Release Time: 7:10 PM Yesterday</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Commander Shitada Broadcasted Yesterday on the Battle of Bogenzaal Great Achievements of the Japanese Naval and Air Forces</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Japanese-American war in the South Pacific is becoming increasingly fierce, especially the strong trend of the battle line in the Solomon Islands, which is attracting worldwide attention. Lieutenant Commander Shitada of the Japanese Fleet Press Department broadcasted on the Shanghai Radio Station at 9:30 PM last night, explaining the battle situation on Bogenville Island. The main points of the broadcast are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy's Purpose</p>
<p>The enemy's operational purpose is not to give Japan "time." Since August of last year, the enemy has been using Australia as a base to launch the so-called "counter-offensive against Japan" from Guadalkanar, a forward base far away from us. In the middle of this year and three months, the enemy successively held the Quebec Conference, the Washington Conference, and the Moscow Conference, boasting that they would launch a major offensive against Japan, and sacrificing a huge amount of manpower, resources, and material resources. However, what they can obtain can only be achieved by drawing closer and closer to Bera Lapeira from Guadalkanaru Island, so our predetermined strategy of "bleeding tactics" has been effective.</p>
<p>Since the Quebec Conference, the enemy's policy of not giving Japan time in the war has been to strengthen its forces as soon as possible on the Pacific front and attack Japan. For example, "If we want to defeat the Japanese army by next year or the year after, we will have to shed an unlimited amount of blood. This point should be taken into consideration." It is emphasized that if Japan is given time, the war will be defeated, so the enemy's biggest fear is that Japan will become stronger and stronger every moment.</p>
<p>Fierce Operation</p>
<p>Since October 16, the enemy's counter-offensive operations in the South Pacific have become increasingly fierce. This is also an attempt to prevent Japan from having enough time. Therefore, the enemy has repeatedly sent 100 to 300 enemy planes to attack, and enemy troops landed on Sono Island on Bogenville Island on the 27th. In this situation, the enemy intends to concentrate the full force of the United States and Australia on New Guinea and Bogenville Island to break through the front line in one fell swoop and recapture our main front line locations, such as Buin and Rabaul, and use this as a base to disrupt our economic and military resources in various places. Therefore, it can be imagined that if the enemy does not abandon this counter-offensive strategy, the enemy will launch a counter-offensive at any cost in the future. The naval battle near Sono Island on the 27th and the naval battle of Bogenville Island announced on the 5th, and the air battle of Bogenville Island announced on the 6th, all show the enemy's anxious state. Long-term operations are extremely beneficial to us, who are currently developing resources in the southern storage area, while the enemy fears that the war will be prolonged.</p>
<p>Great Naval and Air Battle</p>
<p>The air and naval battles of Bogenville Island: This kind of enemy counter-offensive operation, which attempts to shorten the time, has been hit by our "bleeding tactics." Four cruisers were sunk near Mono Island, and in the naval battle of Bogenville Island, eight to nine cruisers and nine destroyers were sunk or destroyed. In addition, two aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and two destroyers of a powerful mobile unit, which attempted to assist these large transportation units and smash our forces in one fell swoop, were also sunk by our aircraft in the area between Mono Island and Truk Island. In this battle of Bogenville Island, we only lost 15 aircraft, and in the air battle, we lost 3 aircraft. The spirit of the Japanese army is bound to impress the world's military experts and British and American military commentators. MacArthur is dreaming of recapturing Rabaul. Since October 17, he has launched an unprecedentedly large-scale air force to continuously attack Bogenville Island and the Finche Sea and Rabaul of New Guinea Island. Among them, from the 22nd to the 26th, the enemy planes that attacked the three locations totaled 2,064. We intercepted them every time, smashed the enemy's combat power, and achieved great results. On the 31st, the enemy dispatched a powerful transport fleet to the north of New Georgia Island. Our naval air force immediately discovered it and launched an attack on the night of the 31st. By the morning of November 2, four transport ships and more than 40 boats were sunk or destroyed, and three cruisers and three destroyers escorting the transport fleet were sunk or destroyed. At the same time, our naval forces also launched a fierce night battle on the night of November 1. Five to six enemy ships were bombed or destroyed, and four destroyers were lost. In the chaos, one enemy destroyer was bombed by its own forces, which shows the enemy's embarrassing situation.</p>
<p>From the evening of the 31st to the morning of the 2nd, except for a part of the troops that landed, the rest were almost completely annihilated. However, MacArthur still ordered Halsey, the commander of the US fleet, to attack Rabaul with 200 planes on the 2nd, but 127 of them were shot down by our naval air force, 51 by the naval forces, and 23 by the ground forces, totaling 202, accounting for 90% of the enemy's planes.</p>
<p>Concealing Defeat</p>
<p>Before attacking Bogenville Island, MacArthur convened Fleet Commander Halsey, Land Forces Commander Harmon, Marine Corps Commander Grid, and others to discuss operational plans. At the meeting, MacArthur boasted with confidence: "Bogenville Island will be captured within a week to build a joint combat and bombing air base." However, MacArthur lost 10,000 men, countless ships and aircraft, and aircraft carriers from the 31st to the 2nd. He must have been extremely sad in his heart, and the American news telegrams did not know whether they had already known MacArthur's sadness or were instructed by him to report that the American fleet hoped to encounter the Japanese fleet, even if it suffered great damage. The production of American aircraft is increasing, "so that the people can turn their eyes away from the fact that the 'bleeding tactics' suffered by Japan are reducing American productivity and the losses on Bogenville Island." Although the United States should try to conceal the matter in its propaganda, it has been fully exposed in this naval battle.</p>
<p>Weaknesses Exposed</p>
<p>The battle situation on Bogenville Island and the Finche Sea of New Guinea shows that the enemy is difficult to use its maximum strength, but the operation is still not satisfactory. The reason is that the enemy's transportation and supply are insufficient. The further the forward east and the front line are, the easier it is to clear. Therefore, the enemy's supply route extends from Asia to Guadalkanar and Bogenville Island, which further magnifies the weakness of American combat power. Therefore, the closer the enemy is to our strategic circle, the more obvious the enemy's weaknesses become.</p>
<p>Judging from the losses of the naval battle of Bogenville Island, the air battle in which four enemy aircraft were lost for every one of ours and the fact that our three aircraft exchanged for the total annihilation of the enemy's entire mobile unit, this great achievement is unprecedented in history. All of this is due to the outstanding skills of our naval aircraft and the surpassing fighting spirit. The enemy is trying to "prevent Japan from having time," but our operation is progressing according to plan, and the development of the South is also proceeding smoothly. In this great achievement, it can be shown that Japan's productive capacity has been significantly enhanced.</p>
<p>Comments from the Economic Community</p>
<h3>Income Tax and Transaction Tax</h3>
<p>A proper way for a nation to raise war funds is nothing more than increasing taxes and issuing public bonds. Issuing banknotes is the worst policy, not just bad, but a slow suicide policy of quenching thirst with poison. However, if the issuance of wartime public bonds fails to achieve satisfactory results, the outcome will be the further issuance of banknotes, which is still a poor policy and a slow suicide policy. Therefore, the best wartime financial policy remains to levy taxes to cover various military and administrative expenses.</p>
<p>According to the news disclosed yesterday by the Shanghai Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, since the recovery of the foreign concessions, the business profit income tax voluntarily declared by companies and enterprises within the first and eighth districts to the office has reached a substantial amount of 36 million yuan. This indicates that our country's wartime finance has clearly embarked on a path of relying on increased taxes to overcome difficulties. In addition, after the reopening of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange yesterday, it was ordered to auction Chinese merchant stocks and collect a transaction tax of six ten-thousandths on spot stock trading on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. The method is for the original brokers to collect half each from the buyer and seller and submit it to the exchange for collection. This is another clear example of our country's wartime finance moving towards increased taxation.</p>
<p>Originally, a country's expenditures should be borne more by those who have the ability to do so, especially during wartime. The payment of income tax by the aforementioned companies and enterprises and the collection of transaction tax on spot stock trading are two concrete manifestations of making those who have the ability to do so bear more of the national military and administrative expenses. It is hoped that the financial authorities, under the parallel and non-contradictory tasks of contracting currency, increasing revenue, suppressing prices, and stabilizing people's livelihoods, will seek rationality in the collection of taxes everywhere. As long as it meets the needs and avoids arbitrary levies, the people should have no objections.</p>
<h3>The Stock Exchange Officially Reopened Yesterday, Auctioning Chinese Stock Spot Goods, Telephone Lines Not Yet Fully Installed, Trading Sparse</h3>
<p>The Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange officially reopened at 9:30 am yesterday in the Shanghai market. All 144 approved brokers, accompanied by an agent wearing a badge, arrived at the exchange. Representatives from relevant authorities and the Securities Supervision Committee were present to monitor, while all others were refused entry for viewing. Trading hours were until 12:00 noon, with the afternoon closed. However, due to the fact that the telephone lines within the exchange were not yet fully installed during the opening auction yesterday morning, the buying and selling of various stock firms could not be concentrated. In addition, the rain was continuous, resulting in sparse trading, with a total volume of 800,000 yuan. It is expected that 30 pairs of intercom telephones can be installed tonight, and the listing can be completed within this week, so there should be good progress in the future.</p>
<p>Trading Units</p>
<p>It is reported that the trading units for listed Chinese stocks on the exchange are divided into three types: 10 shares, 100 shares, and 500 shares.</p>
<p>Price Fluctuation Range</p>
<p>The price fluctuation range for each transaction is 10 yuan for prices above 1,000 yuan, 5 yuan for prices between 500 and 1,000 yuan, 2.5 yuan for prices between 200 and 500 yuan, 1 yuan for prices between 100 and 200 yuan, 0.5 yuan for prices between 50 and 100 yuan, 0.25 yuan for prices below 50 yuan, and 0.1 yuan for prices below 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Commission of Five Thousandths</p>
<p>The handling fees collected by the exchange have been stipulated as five thousandths each for brokers from both the buyer and seller. The exchange collects one and two-fifths thousandths from each broker, and the remaining three and seven-fifths thousandths are the handling fees earned by each broker. In addition, a transaction tax of six ten-thousandths must be collected.</p>
<p>Spot Trading</p>
<p>The stock trading on the exchange is set as spot trading, with two types: immediate delivery and seven-day delivery. Immediate delivery must be completed by 2:00 pm the next afternoon, and seven-day delivery must be completed by 2:00 pm every Monday afternoon. All delivery procedures are entrusted to the National Credit Bank.</p>
<h3>Authorities Strictly Prohibit Illegal Transactions</h3>
<p>Violators Will Be Punished Without Leniency</p>
<p>Under the strict supervision of the competent authorities, the overall price issue in the city has shown a stable state. All speculative hoarding, manipulation, price gouging, and illegal transactions such as short selling are strictly prohibited. Anyone found to be engaged in any of the above-mentioned transactions will not be shown any leniency and will be punished according to the law. For any kind of goods that are to be circulated and traded in the market, a request must be submitted to the relevant authorities in advance for evaluation of standard price limits or approval before it can be traded. However, when submitting the request, a list should be provided stating:</p>
<p>Item, place of origin, trademark name, date of production, manufacturing cost, desired profit, etc. A reporter inquired from various industries yesterday and found that there were few changes in industry and commerce last week.</p>
<p>Industrial Aspect</p>
<p>Except for a small number of factories that have gradually obtained raw materials and are preparing to start production and shipment, most major commodity factories, such as textile printing and dyeing factories, rubber factories, etc., are still temporarily suspending work due to the difficulty in obtaining manufacturing raw materials. However, in order to cope with the current environment, these factories have voluntarily increased their capital.</p>
<p>Commercial Situation</p>
<p>The market prices of most minor commodities have not fluctuated much, and there is an abundance of spot goods, presumably due to the release of large quantities of goods. However, the prices of some major commodities, such as food, fuel, and wool, have rebounded slightly, either due to limited inventory and obstructed sources, or due to improved circulation. The authorities have paid close attention to this. As for newly established businesses, they are very few, and the number of reorganized or transferred existing businesses has increased instead. Therefore, the city's industry and commerce have shifted from abnormal to declining.</p>
<h3>Military Allocation Association Affairs Taken Over by the Trade Liaison Association</h3>
<p>All affairs of the "Central China Military Internal Transaction Consignment Material Sales Allocation Association" (commonly known as the Military Allocation Association), which has been responsible for material control and allocation in the occupied areas for several years, will be taken over by the "Shanghai-China Japan Trade Liaison Association" from today. The Military Allocation Association has long held considerable power in the Central China region, such as the allocation rights of major materials such as machine oil. In late June of this year, 40 Japanese industrial and commercial companies, trading companies, banks, and factories in the Central China region, under the initiative of the Economic Department of the Japanese Embassy, formed the "Japan Trade Federation" to统括various Japanese allocation and transportation associations, and to mutually assist the Chinese Commercial Control Association. Although the establishment of the Federation has been long in the making, it has only recently been formally established. With the support of the Japanese government, it has successively taken over various Japanese industry groups. The powerful Military Allocation Association is naturally no exception. According to the Japanese Embassy, the Japan Trade Federation and the Chinese Commercial Control Association are</p>
<p>Sister Organizations</p>
<p>In the future, the Federation will provide the Commercial Control Association with the greatest possible assistance and cooperation, so that the latter will have no restrictions in various matters. Even the ultimate control rights of major materials such as essential oils will be归需within the system of the Commercial Control Association. The absorption of the military collaboration association by the trade federation is probably a preliminary image of clearly defining the material control authority in the central China region.</p>
<p>Dynamics of Various Industry Associations</p>
<p>After being listed as a major commodity, the Joint Association of the industry, under the leadership of the National General Chamber of Commerce, has established a preparatory office. It is reported that the preparatory work has been largely completed, and it is scheduled to convene the founding meeting on the 24th of this month at the Ningbo Fellow Association. All industry associations in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai must join as members of the Federation.</p>
<p>Hardware Factory Industry The Hardware Factory Industry Association, organized by Pan Youfeng, Zhi Guangwang Lifan, and others, submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry. It is reported that approval has been granted. The association is scheduled to start handling member registration matters at 5 Xintangjia Lane, Qipu Road, starting from the 8th, with a membership deadline of only two weeks.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Maofeng Money Shop in Sichuan Road opened on the 8th of this month. On the same day, it received more than 30 million yuan in deposits. Guests included Wen Lanting, and they were warmly received by Chairman Pan Bingchen and General Manager Wang Hongfa.</p>
<h3>Material Exchange Between Central China and Mengjiang Implemented, Transaction Items Already Determined</h3>
<p>The barter trade of material exchange between the Central China region and South China, North China, Suhuai, and Hong Kong has already been determined and is being implemented under the control of the National General Chamber of Commerce. As for the exchange trade between Central China and Mengjiang, according to reporters, the transaction items have also been determined. (A) Products shipped from the Central China side: flour, raw silk, silk fabrics, cotton bags, paper products, soap, candles, face powder, toothbrushes, plastic products, cosmetics, industrial medicines, metal products, dyes, paints, stationery, tea, miscellaneous food, sugar, cement, machinery and accessories, kitchen knives, etc. (B) Products shipped from the Mengjiang side: coal, medicines, others.</p>
<h3>Stock Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were formally traded on the stock exchange. However, the trading was for trial purposes and the trading volume did not pick up until near noon. Most of the stocks were traded by the individual stock shops. The stock prices first rose then fell. New and old stocks had different trends. Standard MSG had the highest increase due to speculative buying. National China Investment Company and Yong'an Stock Company cooperated with each other, resulting in investors selling off shares. The market saw an increase in the morning and decrease in the afternoon. Only a few colleagues did trading as usual. The summary of stock industry is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Department Stores Yong'an Company opened high but quickly fell back. Both Yong'an and New New both experienced minor declines. Wing On department store was steady. Neiyi was up slightly. Lee An department store opened above par.</p>
<p>Textiles Yong'an Textiles also rose sharply in the morning, and soon fell half a grade. Both Yong'an and Mayar Silk Factory experienced minor declines. Wing Fong Textiles was down.

Hung Hing Weaving opened at 40% higher than the par value. King Fook Shirt Factory traded as high as one-fold, and then slightly lowered. King Lun was at the same price, and the transaction also increased.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals China-France, Hsing Asia opened high and then fell back, and the result was a minor decline. Sincere was also weak. Five Continents, China West, and others remained flat. New Star Pharmaceutical Factory rose nearly twice the par value.</p>

<p>Public Utilities China Electric's electrical power fell below the big price level and then rose again. The North Water and Electricity was flat. Industry The Great China Match suddenly attracted the attention of investors last weekend. There were rumors of increased capital, and the buying frenzy suddenly rose. Nan Yang tobacco and Public Chinese Investment stock rose significantly due to the buying momentum. Kang Yuan Manufacturing finally returned to flat. Standard MSG rose and others remained flat.</p>
<h3>Market Summary</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Yesterday, the market price remained flat. The stock exchange was only open for the first day and for trial purposes, so the bond market was still brewing and there was not much to show. Class C initially rose high, and then fell back to the same as at the end of last week, remaining the same. The Class A, B, D, and E bonds saw mixed gains and losses, but the numbers were small.</p>
<p>Call Loan Yesterday morning, the call loan interest rate of the money industry association was 15%, unchanged. The interest rate remained tight.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain Yesterday morning, the source of rice in the west was slightly less. Also due to the weather, the transaction was slow. The market first rose then declined, with Bo Po Yang Jian all within the target price. The price of Yin Yuan was unchanged. The situation of miscellaneous grains was sluggish. The price of each minor grain was lowered slightly.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities The allocation still has no definite date. Therefore, the asking price of soap and matches remained at the highest level, but the sales were narrow. Most colleagues have stopped trading.</p>
<p>Medicinal Materials Recently, due to the small number of retail sales in the city, the market momentum has slightly improved. Sichuan goods and Zhejiang and Huai goods have uniformly fallen. Tianjin and North goods are still flat.</p>
<p>Cigarettes Although speculations for the future came from all parties, sales of cigarettes actually showed a downward trend. Great Britain fell sharply, Quan Lu also declined slightly. Great Front Gate remained at a high level, and it was difficult for other levels to maintain their original prices.</p>
<p>Rayon Yesterday, the intention of the retail stores to purchase goods was weak, which led to sluggish market momentum and a downward trend.</p>

<h3>Alas! The Future of Colonial Empire Great Britain</h3>
<p>— Qiufeng</p>
<p>Because of this war, Great Britain has no choice but to be reduced to a third-rate country. This has become common knowledge. The well-known civilization critic William Younger (born in 1860) published an article entitled "The Future of Great Britain." He predicted that Great Britain will be reduced to a small country with a population of about 20 million, like the Netherlands, in the 21st century. His views are as follows: Great Britain has become a world power because it has benefited from special temporary conditions. However, these favorable conditions have now disappeared, and countless physical resources and unlimited population will gradually decrease. Recently, the British government authorities regard this increase in population as a matter of urgency. However, increasing the population is completely impossible. However, it does not matter if Great Britain becomes a small country with only a small population. During the era of Bacon, Shakespeare, and Mill, Great Britain was still a small country. Even if Great Britain becomes a small country like the Netherlands again, but as long as it can produce such outstanding people and make real contributions to world culture, then why bother to be sad? This article can arouse our interest because Younger believes that the decline of Great Britain is due to inevitable forces. Therefore, he takes the premise of certain defeat as the basis for his argument. This also shows that the decline of Great Britain is irreversible. The original article was published in the May issue of the "Fortnightly Review" in London as the lead article. The following is its translation:</p>
<p>Agriculture on the Road to Decline</p>
<p>The initial decline was the bankruptcy of British agriculture, which was already clear around 1878. The issuance of currency also seemed to be at this time. The rapid increase in actual wages in the previous century had stopped in the fifteen years before the First World War. The post-war recovery was highly anticipated before encountering the depression in 1929, but this blow was too much for Great Britain to bear. Great Britain is no longer the world's factory. Workers receive high wages, but they do very limited work. We lend large amounts of capital to foreign countries to create factories. Indeed, the interest generated by these loans helps greatly in maintaining the level of settlement, but this capital has now been fully repaid. Great Britain cannot but export goods like equipment across the customs barriers of rival countries, and export irreplaceable minerals overseas in order to support the food of the now inflated population. Even if we set aside the economic nationalism of other countries, Great Britain's foreign trade is paralyzed due to the burden of high production costs and a large population. It will take a long time for previous customers to restore their purchasing power!</p>
<p>No Hope for Population Growth</p>
<p>The current population of Great Britain is due to special conditions. These conditions have disappeared, but can reducing the standard of living maintain this population? The increase in population is determined by economic laws. Cairnes Roberts, in his book "The Revival of the Atlantic," argues that the population of Great Britain should always increase or decrease according to the actual average income per person. I would like to quote the following passage from Cairnes' book:</p>
<p>Europe has become an unprecedentedly densely populated area in world history, and this population is accustomed to a relatively high standard of living. Europe cannot be self-sufficient, and there we now encounter the only danger: that the standard of living of Europeans will rapidly fall to a point that some people regard as actual starvation. Looking back at the tragedy in the history of human progress over the centuries, this is probably a reaction caused by a temporary favorable sample that allows the population to expand, or due to natural forces or human hands, that suddenly stops.</p>
<p>The Inevitability of Great Britain's Decline</p>
<p>The British Empire is a federation composed of many countries. Therefore, in the future, the British Empire may be able to be successfully established with blood and spirit, but perhaps not, and it is not yet known. It is not impossible for all English-speaking countries to form an alliance, but in this alliance, the United States will be the leader! The era of industrialism that we are calling for has obviously come to an end. Therefore, our status as a strong country in Europe has also been lost. In the next hundred years, we will return to Great Britain before the industrial revolution. We fear that we will become a country with a population of 20 million, living a self-sufficient life. In summary, I look to the future with many expectations. Of course, the transition period cannot but be painful. But if we cannot now restrain dishonest agitators, then democracy will be destroyed in its last refuge!</p>
<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>Eradicating Evil Thoroughly</h3>
<p>— Huang Yan</p>
<p>Ancient China, unable to withstand the century-long erosion and poisoning by the British and Americans, has fallen into a state of destruction and decline. Although the majority of its evil forces have been swept away since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the deepness of its poison has already penetrated the bone marrow. Therefore, there are still many accumulated malpractices and lingering poisons in the social and cultural aspects, which are not easy to wash away cleanly in a short time. At this time when China and Japan are advancing side by side with the goal of expelling the evil forces of Britain and America, as the saying goes: "Cultivating virtue requires perseverance, eradicating evil requires thoroughness." It is truly necessary to thoroughly eradicate these deeply rooted malpractices. Based on my limited views, I will briefly describe several points as follows:</p>
<p>Replacing English with Chinese</p>
<p>English, under the guise of "introducing science" as a cultural strategy: In recent times, it has almost usurped the host's position, tending to exclude China's own writing. Regardless of major institutions, banks, stores, etc., how is the level of the staff's native language? Most are neglected and not deeply investigated, but the requirements for English proficiency are taken very seriously; even the schools that shoulder the responsibility of education (not to mention the so-called "missionary schools") not only list English as one of the most important subjects, some even force English training on students in the third or fourth grade of elementary school. Does such a measure not mean that the Chinese people will be taught to be slaves of the British and Americans for generations to come? China has its own solid writing system. Indeed, it may have various shortcomings, but this can only be overcome through its internal abandonment, and it is definitely not allowed to be replaced by English. I have seen many "compatriots" with yellow faces and lowered heads who, when expressing their intentions to each other, often abandon the Chinese language and use English to replace it. For example, when two people are parting, they can clearly say "再見 (zài jiàn - goodbye)!", but they insist on saying "Good Bye!" etc. This kind of slavish psychology that overvalues English, I believe, must be corrected. In order to correct this mistaken psychology, I humbly believe that:</p>
<p>All institutions, banks, companies, and stores should use Chinese as the main language in their documents.</p>
<p>The authorities should explicitly prohibit Chinese people from using English for letters, conversations, or other expressions of meaning in daily use.</p>
<p>The time for teaching English in schools should be greatly reduced. (It is really unnecessary for students in lower-level schools to learn English; the English subject should be abolished; the time spent on English studies in general secondary schools and above should also be reduced as much as possible.) (I heard that in secondary schools and above in North China, the English course has been changed to an elective subject, which is gratifying.)</p>
<p>Textbooks should not be used in English versions. If there are valuable English versions in science and literature that have not been translated, the Ministry of Education should designate a certain number, select those that are most needed and most relevant for Chinese people, and hire experts to translate them into Chinese versions before they can be read.</p>
<p>The above points can also be generally applied to other foreign languages, depending on the needs of the situation, in principle.</p>
<p>Eradicating Ideological Toxins</p>
<p>For thousands of years, Chinese social culture has been centered on Confucianism. Regarding merchants' pursuit of profit, the words "righteousness" and "profit" have always been mutually coordinated and not contradictory. Originally, the Chinese people regarded those who were diligently pursuing profit as "small men" and did not value them. Confucius once said: "The superior man is conversant with righteousness; the mean man is conversant with profit." Yan Hui lived in a humble alley, eating a single basket of rice and drinking a gourd of water; Confucius praised him. Even if Zigong was good at accumulating wealth, it was not valued by the literati.</p>
<p>However, since the intrusion of the evils of mammonism and utilitarianism into China, it has greatly created the bad psychology in today's Chinese society, where people generally value money and disregard morality, and are selfish and self-serving. Such as the rampant speculation in recent years, the fratricide caused by the struggle for wealth, the discord between brothers... and the snobbery of valuing clothes and disregarding character, etc., directly or indirectly, it can be said that all are affected by the poison of this morbid psychology. Thus, the entire society values money, neglects morality, and falls into a precarious situation. If this continues, it will inevitably form a second Jewish people. This phenomenon cannot be ignored by us, and therefore, we should find ways to correct it. On the negative side, I think at least:</p>
<p>The various material enjoyments of the rich should be restricted, and their private lives should be strictly supervised.</p>
<p>The opening of all pleasure venues (commonly known as "gold-consuming caves") and the manufacture, sale, and use of luxury goods should be prohibited.</p>
<p>If the above two points cannot be achieved for the time being, at least the highest or special tax rates should be levied on their donations.</p>
<p>Restrict merchants' free trade and usury.</p>
<p>Strictly strengthen the material control and allocation policy. If there are any violations, in addition to fines, physical punishment should also be imposed.</p>
<p>Stipulate the clothing and living standards of people of all levels, including scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants... strive to keep their consumption to a very low level (especially the lifestyle of the merchant class and generally decadent public officials should be paid more attention to).</p>
<p>The above are only from the negative side, and on the positive side:</p>
<p>Actively promote the New National Movement. Not just persuasion, but also coercion.</p>
<p>Advocate for proper entertainment, and provide various conveniences, encouragement, rewards, or assistance when necessary.</p>
<p>The government should provide honorary and material rewards to those among the scholars, farmers, and workers who are honest, lonely, and hardworking in their positions and have achievements. Ensure that they are not forced to leave their posts due to hunger and cold. At the same time, it can avoid being despised by the wealthy.</p>
<p>All of the above are based on principles. In short, the use of money must be restricted, and the omnipotent effect of money must be sometimes exhausted so that the talent without money is better than the wealth with money. In the beginning, the motive and purpose of mammonists was only to accumulate money to satisfy all their desires. If this can be done, I think at least it can make "the poor have no envy and no extravagant thoughts; the rich have no arrogance and extravagance, and eliminate the sprouts of lust." From then on, the ideas of mammonism and utilitarianism may no longer have room for mischief in the hearts of the Chinese people!</p>
<p>Formal Reform</p>
<p>Reform of Western Suits and Abolition of Ties—Speaking of Western suits, everyone praises their convenience, but I have always thought that Western suit ties are a kind of tumor, a kind of "civilized shackle". For example, economically speaking, it is really not cost-effective to spend a few yuan or dozens of yuan to buy these things. And every day, in order to make it neat and tidy, it takes a lot of time. And in terms of practicality, it is not necessarily needed in clothing. Even in terms of aesthetics, it is not necessarily beautiful, because beauty and ugliness are relative. Who dares to say that having a tie is definitely more beautiful than not having one? Therefore, I think ties are really a superfluous thing in clothing. The acquisition of materials is so difficult, every thread should be doubly cherished, thinking about where it comes from is not easy. Instead of spending precious materials and labor to make such an unnecessary thing, it is better to transfer it to other uses, to increase the production of necessities and increase a bit of vitality for the country. Therefore, I think the ties of Western suits really need to be abolished.</p>
<p>After the ties are abolished, the style of Western suits should be changed accordingly. In terms of quality, it does not necessarily have to be British or American wool. In terms of style and convenience, the "Zhongshan suit" or "student uniform" set by the Premier is a good style of clothing that takes the advantages and discards the disadvantages. The authorities can also issue an order to designate it as the national service uniform of China so that the whole country can follow it. Confucius said: "If Guan Zhong had ruled the barbarians, we should have been wearing our hair unbound, and fastening our robes on the left side." The British and Americans are already our enemies, and Western suits are the common clothes of the British and Americans, why should we learn to wear the clothes of the enemy?</p>
<p>Abolition of High Heels—I think women's high heels are also a "civilized shackle." It is a foot binding that Europeans and Americans have infected us with. I have heard and seen many modern female compatriots struggling to fight for freedom. Since the ban on foot binding, it can be said that women's feet have been liberated. But since the popularity of high heels, many of the so-called modern female compatriots who strive for women's freedom have followed suit, and as a result, they have once again fallen into the abyss of pain and unfreedom. Really, is it difficult to say: "Modernity is just a little bit of style?" Can the freedom that is protected be said to be willingly abandoned again?</p>
<p>The above few points, I suppose, will not be "throwing away food because of choking"! I sincerely hope that everyone can work together to eradicate accumulated malpractices and wash away the remaining poisons. Infuse new blood so that the new China can recover and be built up sooner.</p>
<p>Social Service</p>
<h3>A Record of Visiting the Tongren Charity Association's Model Training Institute</h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>A few days ago, I traveled through Nanshi, near Bijiayu Road, and saw a desolate scene of collapsed houses and rubble. Walking and walking, near the intersection of Minguo Road, I suddenly saw a temple standing on the roadside. Looking at it, it was the Fire God Temple. The temple looked old, with the words "Tongren Charity Association Model Factory and Training Institute" and "Civilian Obligation School" written on it in large characters, black ink on a white background, which were very clear. Entering it, the buildings were dilapidated, the pavilions were all furnaces, and two or three women were drawing water and washing clothes in the courtyard, chatting and laughing freely. In the back hall, I saw more than a hundred orphans divided into three places, taking classes. They were all cleanly dressed and had clean faces, and they acted generously, but they were light and thin, and wore single clothes. After inspecting it for a week, I felt that the regulations of the institute were commendable, but it still needed more arrangements.</p>
<p>Wandering around, I turned upstairs and saw a craft room on the opposite side with a mud workshop and a knot workshop, displaying products, of which the "Golden Rooster Standing Alone" commemorative product was the most outstanding. Passing the office, I entered the director's office. The director of Anhui Province received me and invited me to sit down. After offering tea, I asked for details. He replied that Mr. Xu Qianlin from Yuyao had set up a model factory for vagrants in Jiangwan, and hired Mr. Cai Chunfang to preside over it. The scale was grand, but it has now been disbanded, but the spirit of Tongren still exists. Mr. Cai, based on his foresight, established this institute here in March of this year, intending to revive the factory and continue his ambition. To date, it has not been a full year, and the number of orphans admitted has increased daily, but because the supply is huge and the source of funds is lacking, Director Cai has repeatedly felt that he cannot continue. He runs around all day, begging philanthropists from all walks of life to happily donate and help, but there is too much porridge for too many monks, so distribution is difficult. Now it is cool autumn, and when autumn goes, winter cold comes again, and quilts, cotton clothes, and shoes and socks are still needed. Recently, Director Cai has felt depressed every day. After finishing speaking, he seemed to be thinking. I said to him, "If Mr. Cai is here, construction will happen one day." I wanted to see him, but he said that he had gone out on business. I sat silently for a while, bid farewell, and went out. Looking up, I saw two scrolls of Yuyao scenery and landscape paintings on the wall, with Cai Jun's pictures printed on them. I thought they must have been painted by Director Cai, with clear depictions and elegant writing, and superb skills. After returning home, I expressed my feelings and wrote this to call for the orphans in the institute. I hope that philanthropists from all walks of life will generously show benevolence and righteousness, donate money if you have money, and generously sponsor, donate things if you have things, and help the orphans, in order to promote social welfare and benefit the promotion of the new Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Youth Light Corps Launches Social Service Work</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Youth League of the Youth Association has worked hard in various social service undertakings. The Youth Light Free School, which was run this summer, has more than 300 graduates, with excellent results. Recently, the personnel of the group have been changed, and the new officers' inauguration ceremony will be held. More than 600 guests arrived, and Mr. Li Shoubao presided over the inauguration ceremony. After the meeting, there were wonderful performances, which aroused the interest of the guests. After this reorganization, the organization of the group became stronger. Recently, it will take a further step to launch various social service works.</p>
<h3>Poor Teacher Requests Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>I have been serving in secondary school education for many years. I have always been honest and self-reliant, and I have never been lax in my work for a day. However, recently, prices have soared endlessly, and a meager salary of several hundred yuan is difficult to maintain even the lowest level of personal life, let alone other things. Now, due to an accident, all my clothes have been lost. The leaking house is exposed to the rain, and it is difficult to endure the cold weather in winter with only a few clothes. I have no choice but to ask to borrow a corner of your newspaper to call for help from those in society who sympathize with poor teachers, donate a few winter clothes and a cotton quilt so that I can avoid the cold and continue working.
