<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">嚴肅官常 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>月之三日，我們曾以「重視政治責任」爲題，申論政府對於官吏失職，應重視責任，殿明賞罰，不能僅以免職了事。政洽上無責罰，即無紀律，無是非，無效率。特別强調：「中國國家復興，人民生活安定，端賴政治修明；而政治修明，必自賞罰嚴明始」。我們自覺聲色雖厲，情緖雖激，而愛護政府的態度，敢說非常坦白而純潔。</p>
<p>我們在是評中曾列舉兩個事例，第一個關於本市警察分局長失檢一點，頃承上海市政府秘書處來函聲明，我們除將原函在本評之後全文披露外，尙有不能已於言者，略加申述。</p>
<p>首先應聲明者，我們對於任何論述，任何舉例，向來不敢委曲事實，隨聲附和的。如果根據失實，立論偏頗，也必坦白接受更正，絕不推諉搪塞，以重責任，「是」則自爲是，「非」則自爲非，無法顚倒。我們並不願意因社會輿論的樂聞而危言聳聽或造作矯揉；况且一般官常越軌之事，人民憂戚之不遑，何嘗樂問？如果以記者立塲，爲博取社會輿論之樂聞，而作歪曲事實之論，則近乎幸災樂禍之心理，我們認爲最要不得。這次舉例，自亦有所根據，因不便在此申述，另巳備函答復，諒當局必能同情本報立塲。因爲我們心所謂危，不敢不言，雖爲社會輿論或少數人所惡聞者，亦稍不迴避，率直言之。此種態度，自問爲去年年底復刋以來一貫立塲。至於是非毀譽，自有社會定評，非所計亦非願計者。</p>
<p>大凡政治未上軌道，銓叙考試制度未曾確立化之時，常有兩種普遍現象：一種是低級職員每逢長官新仔時，爲奉承取歡，或企圖升職，因有借機向民間歛財作「孝敬」之舉。一種是新仟長官往往有授意下級發動「孝敬」，萬一事敗，則由下級負其責仟。這種現象竟在本市發現，幸市府當局爲嚴肅官常，加以免調處分，這樣賢朋的措置，自然値得欽佩，而尤眞正爲社會輿論所樂聞。同時，我們感覺此類情事，當局應不以與論提出後始爲指正，似應早予公開發表，使社會瞭然。</p>
<p>我們對於市府這一聲明，深覺具有兩種重大意義，其一，今後人民對於官常如有同樣情事發生，即可不再上當。並盼當局准許市民隨時吿發。其二，今後各級負責長官對於下級人員有所警戒，隨時留心他們的行動，以免貽誤自身亮節。俾官常越軌現象，從此永絕，政治軌道，從此確立。幸甚！幸甚！</p>

<p>東京五日中央社電日情報局五日下午零時三十分發表：日靑木大束亞相最近曾扑中華民日及滿洲國，茲以公畢『巳於五日下午零時三十分歸抵福岡。</p>
<p>奉天五日中央社電日靑木大東亞相於離滿之時，特發表談話，大意如次：余早欲訪問滿洲國，俾向滿洲國自大東亞戰爭以來所作之莫大貢獻，表示謝意，並與滿洲國要人懇談，同時親察現地各機關狀况，此次能完成此種願望，實深欣慰。滿洲國於過去十年中之建設，實令世界驚異，而日本爲使　亞各民族脫離英美桎梏之執戈奮起，同時滿洲國亦傾注全力積極協力，除鎭　北邊外，並供給鐵糧食等在貫澈戰爭上極重要之資源資材，凡此貢獻皆至爲巨大，而尤深爲感謝者。此外目覩担當鎭護北卞重鎭之關東軍之嚴格訓練及警備狀况，亦極爲感奮。余在此次訪滿之前，曾先訪問中華民國，巳目見中國正着着改善建設施策，並與日本同生同死以協力貫激大東亞戰爭之現狀，今又逢滿洲國興隆之發展及決心加强日滿一體之決意，巳使大東亞戰爭必勝之信念益形堅固。</p>
<p>對華施策進行滿意</p>
<p>東京五日中央社電據此間政治觀察家談：日靑木大東亞相於完成訪問中華民國及滿洲國之任務以後，已於五日返國。猶憶本年四月靑木大臣曾赴泰國越南及南方各地觀察，此次則又訪問中　兩國，由此可見敵方反宣傳之亳無價値。尤其當此中國正以東亞之立塲，而着着發展之時，其意義更爲深長，此次靑木大臣之訪問中國，乃爲詳細視察日本實施新政策後之巾國實情，及以中國事發展爲背景，就今後中日提携之具體方　，與中國政府當局舉行懇談。於此並得接觸羅進中之中國各地實情，並實地視察日方實施新政策之具體情形，故其結果，對新政策之推進，能更抱樂觀，自不待言。同時由現實事態關於中國今後施策及中日提携之具體施策，亦得一明明方針。且此次靑木大臣訪問巾國，曾面謁國府汪主席懇談，並與華北政務委員會委員長王克敏氏及國府財長周佛海，外長諸民誼，實業部長梅思平等率直開應懇談，其對中日兩國意思之疏通，巳獲得莫大成就。其次在上海亦曾與中日政界人士舉行懇談，其在政治方面如中日間基本條約之根本改訂，其他方面如物資物價對策之具體表現等當前問題之推進，影響所及，均深堪注目，此次靑木大臣之訪問中滿，其最足誇示於世界者，乃爲中日滿三國巳形成大東亞共榮圈之核心，於同一戰綫之上協力貫澈大東亞戰爭之事實，且對今後三國提携之方策，將益臻具體，此次意義自極重大。</p>

<p>羅馬五日中央社電　海通社，義軍昨日公佈謂：英軍已在加拉布里亞建橋頭堡壘、且正在尋覓進入内地之通路，故反軸心軍佔領勒佐之行動，乃在保護其側翼。但甚爲重要之地點，當以聖喬凡尼及薩爾爲首因爲其在麥西拿海峽之西北角也。若佔得此　地點，則反軸心軍常可獲得進入内地之兩條通路，現英軍所建立之橋頭堡，使其得自東及東南兩面前進，但坦克之使用當受極大之限制。</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電</p>
<p>德國新聞社訉：反軸心國迭次企圖勒佐之登陸，均被德軍擊退，在此區山戴尙有發生，但軸心軍並不希望在此處有主要之戰事，因在山地足以阻止摩托化軍隊之行動也。加拉布里亞之交通甚爲不利，較好之道路祗在沿海有之。美軍現棄英軍於困難之境地。因美軍在西西里受損過重，故仍朱參加登陸之行動，或老艾森霍華將軍欲使其軍隊於另一處登陸，亦未可知。在比基大突尼斯　所集中之船隻，或係留作美軍與法叛軍同作登陸之用者。</p>

<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電據此間所接東綫消息：頓巴斯區蘇軍作戰目標，係在奪囘重工業中心地之斯太林諾，由泰幹洛格繞道北上，以圖切斷通馬留坡爾之鐵道。自三日夜起，德蘇兩軍爲爭奪斯太林諾東北之交通綫，即展開激戰，截至四日止，其主力戰綫由斯太林諾北方五十公里之尼基特副加南下，經加爾羅夫卡向東方突出，再由特瓦爾柴奧至克柴尼科佛。據蘇聯情報局四日公布稱：克柴尼科佛之蘇軍已扺達斯太林諾果方三十公里之伊羅維斯克後，復轉鋒向西挺進，直搗斯太林諾之正面，但此說尙未經軸心方面承認。又斯太林諾北方之蘇軍，企圖由尼某特大加。加爾羅夫卡向西挺進，進攻克拉斯鏤阿爾梅斯克羅，企圖切斷頓巴斯方面德軍之退路，但德軍竭力反攻，兩軍乃展開機械化部隊之消耗戰，德軍雖力阻蘇軍前進，惟戰局仍嚴重</p>

<p>稱爲反軸心聯合國的計美英包括加拿人，澳洲，新西蘭，南非聯邦）蘇聯，重慶，洪都拉斯，薩爾瓦多，瓜地馬拉，古巴，科斯泰里加，伊拉克，尼加拉圭，荷蘭，巴拿馬，　西哥，比利時，希臘，秘魯，埃及，烏拉圭，巴西，巴拉圭，玻利維亞，智利，挪威，哥倫比亞，委納瑞拉，伊朗，愛瓜都爾，阿比西尼亞，波蘭，南斯拉夫，捷克，盧森堡等，在這三十三國中，除英美蘇三國以外，不僅是無　力的弱小國，而且如荷蘭，希臘，比利時，挪威，南斯拉夫，盧森堡，波蘭，捷克等，均爲沒有國家的亡命政權，而英國竟稱之爲同盟國，寗非滑稽。羅邱以大西洋憲章爲反軸心國之政治的，理念的，道義的某礎，用以保全小國的獨立，這完全是空頭支票。邱吉爾於七月十四日在英國下院答復議員的質問稱　「大西洋憲章不是條約，故其修正毋須與各國政府一一交涉。」可見大西洋憲章並無何等拘束力，英國本身亦無何等責任。</p>
<p>挪威領袖著書揭發</p>
<p>英國副首相阿特里也於七月十八日在下院公然宣稱爲保障反軸心國的安全，割　領土是必要的。對此英美的抹殺小國主義最表示憤　的是挪威亡命政權領袖享勃羅博士。他在近著「勝利之路」一書中攻擊英美的欺瞞政策如次</p>
<p>「英美二國佯稱希望恢復小國的主權，尊重其政治的權利，但小國：獲英美二國的承認，不能作任何事項。英美帝國主義們完全輕視小國任意分割世界，以壓力加諸政府。是以歐洲諸小國一如俎上之肉，一任英美宰割。」</p>
<p>他更列舉挪威如何爲英美犧牲的事例，故英國政府禁止該書的發賣。波蘭亡命政權首相薛哥爾斯基及其女公子幕僚七月五日囘在直布羅陀附近來英機久事殞命。原因不明。民的橫死如實地說明了小國的命運。巾南美諸小國的感想正亦相同。數日前哥倫比亞外相向委納瑞拉巴拉圭，愛瓜多爾，智利諸國提議立卽召開拉丁美洲共同會議，關於擁護主權及戰後將發生之諸問題不能不在今日預爲閘明其主張與立塲，而有團結的必要。英美帝國主義的侵略小國主權，在最近對中立國的政策上意見露骨。美國使用一切手段如同喝，收買，謀略，威嚇，壓迫等使拉丁美洲諸國除阿根廷以外悉歸反軸心陣綫。對今日猶嚴守中立的阿根廷，於八月三日斷然實行向美國輸出强迫其放棄中立政策。因這種種實例，使諸小國徹底認識了英美帝國主義的野心，而止在設法逃避其魔手，從事於主權領土的防衛。（翔：譯自八月二十八日四部每日新聞）</p>

<p>— 卓榮</p>
<p>上月二十五日申報社評論述上海敎育上的危機，並爲消除此項危機起見，主張從積極地改善敎職員的待遇入手。另一方而，則强令學生實踐倫機（此項危機和解救的辦法，當爲熟心敎育人士，尤其是敎育當局所重視。筆者僅就學生的立塲，把現時或爲一般大中學校在教育熟施上所忽略的地方，提出幾點來，藉資參考）庶幾在消徐敎育上的危機呼聲中，上下。致努力，挽狂瀾於既倒。</p>
<p>發展學生的團體生活學校敎育的目的，不僅是傅授知識與技能，更重要的。邑培養身心健全的國民，可是目前上海的一般學校，多半已經轉變一成單是知熟傅授的機關，　械了訓育學生的責任，對於學生的課外活動，更是不聞不問，聽任其自由發展，　種畸形的現象是一應矯正的，本來，學校教育最可貴的地方，在於　　手人眞　地享受團體生活的訓練（因有”有在適當的國體生活營陶之下，靑年的熱情。蓬勃的朝氣和辦事的手腕。才能合理地充份發展，而愛　　蘭，遵守紀律熱心服務的精神，才可養成。但以目前的情形來論，學生到學校裹來，在課堂裏　坐幾小時，下課以後，大家分散，各幹各的事去了，而校內一些學生團體，不是廢止了便是徒有名目·如此看來，同學問的關係，眞如一盤散沙。沒有團結一致的精神，師生問的隔膜，是不用說的了，即在同系同級的同學之中，也因爲缺乏聯絡機會的關係，竟有互不相識者，還種情形，在實行學分制的學校裏，很是普遍，因爲各一人選修的學科並不盡同，有時同一學科，分級上課。同學間既少接觸交談的一機會，彼此間自難了解。一所謂推誠相見，互切互磋的交情，更是談不到了，我敢大胆說，上述的團體一生活特色，在這樣的塲合下，沒有特殊的作用，因一而，一羣學生，由於一時一情感的激動，斷武格鬥的醜事也都發生了，這類事件，在足以證明學生沒一有受到團體生活的薰陶，但學校當局領導不力，官不能辭咎，因此。我覺得欲要重振敦　的學風。寶有整頓校內一切學生團體的必要，務使它能發揮本來的性能，聯絡各同學。在知德育三方面，共同努，待掃門學間的關係密切以後，進而使師生的關係打成一片。如此，才可以力除學生們自私自利的態一度，和個人主義的絕端發一　，同時也可以防止他們一　　崛起自動學習的風一氣一般人都認爲現在的一學生程度退步，學生不夠用功偷懶怠惰，這是局部的事實，不容諱言的。因爲有些商業式的學校、過份加鬆學生的功課。可是，另有一些學校。矯枉過正，實行堆鴨式的敎育，不　學生的能力與精力，專　採用較深的課本自譽。我覺得，學生精神　漫，不專心向學，由於學校裹，缺少一種氣氛，促使他們起勁地用功讀醫，倒是很重要的一個原因。　原因的形成，是多方面的。。　知說，外間物質生活的引誘。，　業以後。不容易找到適當的職業，煩悶的環境等等都是。但是我們不要忽視了學校當局缺少採取鼓勵學生猛進不已的舉動這一方面。這從學較當局取消了學術上的各機比賽競賽，以及停止舉行硏究會，討論會，演講會等方面，可以窺見，　也不能否認，好勝心是人人皆有的，一個學生的學個惘結，很容易受榮耀的鼓動。倘學校當局能夠把握學生的心理善爲利用，即向來用功的學生，愈加用功他們的好學精神，不難影響其他的同學，於是有作爲的能自愛的靑年，皆能在學問下工夫，他們便沒有餘心與餘晷，到校外花天酒地，流連於歌　舞榭學風的整頓，未始不能在這一方面收到一點效果，</p>

<p>諺云：一計欲密而行須速一或曰：「靜茶處子，動如兔脫」，其眞正用意知何，姑作別論，總之，如欲從事一件事情，則左顧右盼之　巡態度，爲古來名將所不取，我人與敵國英美有相當區別，目下正在太平洋，印度洋各　展開死戰，不待言大東亞戰爭乃先有周密之計劃與必勝之決心後，方與敵方啓此戰端，且唯我日本，抱有戰必勝之自信而戰，故對於戰局之變化。國際情勢之變動，絕對毋席憂慮。祗須向預期之目的，使英美締城下之盟而邁進已足，英美最近舉行奎貝克會談、積極推進謀略宣傳，淺見之一喜一憂，不僅爲我人所不應取的態度、且那樣膽小終究不能完成大東亞井榮圈的大業，換言之，欲求戰勝，指導者必須冷靜，國民尤須埋頭苦幹，勇往直前。縱令英美調集大量艦隊來襲東京，我們祗要堅持如北條時宗之：「雖千萬敵人，我必苦幹」的決心，足夠應付。</p>
<p>我人應深切認識有勝無敗態勢</p>
<p>現在我人所遭遇的大東亞戰爭的國難，在規模上遠非過去的國難所能比擬，但在國難的危險性上，較之過去爲輕。何以言之？躉在量的方而我日本陸海軍足與英美兩國的陸海軍匹敵，在經濟力上亦足與英美抗衡的緣故。我人之祖先，以十分的力量對抗敵方無限的力量，尙能突破國難而獲致勝利，何况現在我人以十分的力量擋十分的敵人、豈有不勝之理。不過我人現在應該認淸，日本已經確立有勝無敗的態態，抱着不辭以獨力對付世界的決心。</p>
<p>捧讀前年十二月八日所頒對英美宣戰之大詔，即可明白：日本爲了掃除經濟上，軍事上之一切威脅以謀東亞的安定起見，爲了要求自存自衛起見，故毅然　起，始終以獨力求其解決。</p>
<p>當然我們先已有了必勝的成算　崛起。以太平洋爲舞台的戰鬥，在規模上旣爲空前未有的戰鬥、則常然不能因若干得失而一喜一憂，試將世界地圖展開翻閱，一目瞭然日本已經確寸有勝無敗的勢態。縱有敵機來襲，或我方喪失若千佔領地等情事。亦不足憂慮。况在戰爭時期，敵機來襲我方佔領飾，亦爲兵家之常、在大東亞戰爭發生後之半年中，英美在束亞之百年來勢力，已全被掃除，然彼等李今不是還在誇稱要奪囘失地嗯？目下我人所遭受的若千敵機來襲，與英美的損害比較，實不能同日而語。</p>
<p>美國復又誇稱將以生產力與我日水對抗，這恰又爲利於我方的方法。美國生產力自本年起已漸趨减少，反之，日本的生產力，從本年起突飛猛進，是以彼我正相反對，無論在生產戰，長期戰上，莫不有利於日本。假若美國使用破壞通商戰法，此亦有利於日方，敵國之潛水　唯有爲日方驅逐艦擊毀而已。在飛機方面亦然，故戰綫毫無不利的跡象，日本無論在經濟力上，軍事力上均已奠定必勝的地位。奠定這必勝不敗勢態之原動力，自然是日本海軍縱橫活躍之無敵行動，如伽達實加納爾島守備隊之勇戰，阿圖島、基斯加島守備隊之奮鬭。敵方不知我國努力於大束亞之政治，經濟建設情形，被日方誘導作戰的計劃所乘。遂集龐大兵力於伽達爾加納爾島及阿圖島，結果蒙奠大的損害。當其克復該處後向本團國民宣傳鼓吹時，日方早已確立有勝無敗之勢熊？</p>
<p>所以今後美軍無論怎樣反攻，我們早已立於不敗的態勢。具有必勝的信念，唯我們必須充分認識這態勢、而勿爲英美的謀略戰所乘。加薩勃朗加會談，奎貝克會談，和義國的情勢，一點也沒有擔心的必要。假使有這種人那便爲英美的謀略戰所乘了。因此，在思想戰上，不能不愈加昂揚打倒英美的敵愾心。英美的從軍記者，曾有一文述及日本如何立於有勝無敗的態勢。茲節錄其原文的一節於下：</p>
<p>日本用大規模的攻勢在大平洋獲得完全勝利後已告滿足。現在該方面陸海空的防禦陣勢已更見加强。被解放而獲得自由的土著居民、協力日軍建設這防禦陣勢。假以時日，日本將建設爲世界最大的國家，把亞洲諸民族置於其指導下。</p>
<p>越南的中國人，泰國人，馬來人等，正在自覺他們的運命與日本相共。爲了防備的周密起見，日本正在增强其空軍。爲　折與蘇羅門羣島方面同樣的奧軍登陸企圖，日本軍正積極加强一切戰略地點的防禦，依某特派員的船吿，菲島的可萊希特爾島的防禦，勝過直布羅陀。現在日水的作戰，　當將來美軍前來攻擊的時候，在這裏與以極大的損害，阻止太平洋之大規模戰鬥的展開，以沮喪美國的民氣。</p>
<p>現在那樣的美軍作戰，正合日本的意思，在美軍開始作戰的時俠，日軍業已把一切收入掌中了，美軍即在目前亦被阻於日軍的前哨綫，幹了牛年，不過奪囘一個飛機塲，三數個密林村落而已。」</p>
<p>以上所述，乃在說明日本的强大，而想以英美的總力對付日本。敵人自已已經承認日本有勝無敗的態勢，力成國民勿輕視對日的戰爭</p>
<p>奎貝克會談</p>
<p>最近羅邱二氏爲了遂行戰爭而舉行所謂奎貝克會談經二星期的討論，於二十三日告終，這次會談，各想擴伸自己的權益，滿蓄着野心，所謂同床異夢，吳越同舟的醜態，不雖想像。羅邱二氏到現在爲止，或在威爾斯親王號上，或在加薩勃朗加，或在奎貝克，業已會談六次。但會談的結果，一件也沒有實現。故以這昨多會談喝不是作戰的會談，乃是對世界，對木國民衆之宣傳策略的會談。苟會談的結果一經決定，就沒有那樣屢作會晤的必要了。</p>
<p>即使含談的結果以日本爲「第一攻擊的目標」，我們現在也沒有驚異的必要。因爲我們和英美作戰，無論英美是否將傾注其全力來攻擊我國，我們毫無改變態度的必要。</p>
<p>英美高呼「現在改以日本爲第一敝國而打倒之」，但在一年半之前，我們即已高呼「迫英美作城下之盟，在紐約舉行盛大閱艦　。」</p>
<p>所謂羅邱會談，所謂煽惑宣傳，大多爲宣傳簽略的一種，這一點效法蘇秦張催的重慶發言人亦頗表不滿。最近宋子文宋美齡千里迢迢的到美國去。大受國　的待遇，羅斯福並確實允許供給飛機汽油，於是得意揚揚地囘到重慶。然而後來連一架飛機一加侖汽油也朱見送來。</p>
<p>又反軸心軍把八月一十三日在加拿大的奎貝克會談內容大本宣傳，但復稱「因作戰的關係」而隱蔽其内容，從事各種宣傳策略。古時有「不言實行」的話，又曰「言之匪觀，行之維艱」。英美如其眞正在討論作戰，自當嚴守秘密。但從他們把會談的內容向世界大事宣傳的一事看來，奎貝克會談實無加以重視的必要。</p>
<p>他們爲使一般人不注意蘇聯不參加會談的事實，於是宣傳說：「本會談爲對日作戰的會談，」一面使瀕死的重慶政權狂喜，他方並止住蘇聯的不平，用一箭雙鵰的方法，來鼓舞疲弊不堪的英國民衆，及內部衝突迭起的美國民衆的士氣。</p>
<p>八月二十七日，羅斯夫夫人訪問澳洲時稱：「如其不是我個人，丈夫也一同來此的話，將可以更欣喜地飽覽風景。」假託澳洲的景色而發表談話，其實他顯然負有前次五月諾克斯對麥克沃塞想解決澳洲內部衝突的使命。</p>
<p>又蒙特伯頓就任東南亞洲聯合軍司令官時，英國海軍部長諾克斯在新聞記者會見席上稱：「余毫無所知。海軍部隊亦不　其指揮」。充分暴露出美國陸海軍内部的斜紛。</p>
<p>如上所述，我國因以必勝的信念開始戰爭，故英美無論取怎樣的策略，怎樣的作戰，我國軍事上，經濟上的有勝無敗的態勢，不僅亳不崩潰，且自本年宋起，將凌駕英美。我們現在應特別注意者，在於確立思想戰上的必勝信念，昂揚擊　英美的敵愾心。</p>
<p>先就昻揚敵　心而言，一般人在口頭上雖都說同仇瞰愾，但英美之流的殘澤尙支配着頭腦而朱能排脫。奎貝克會談之後，羅斯福在加拿大的議會上把「博愛」當作口頭禪，誠爲深獲人心的策略宣傳。專吹　螺的美國，一手包辦宣傳人道主義。但在美日本人待遇及我國的對待美人，有天壤之別。對這種非人道非正義的英美，如今日猶有爲其宣傳範略所乘者，那麽在思想說上就先已失敗了。是以爲了使我有勝無敗的態勢益　完全起見，應昻揚敵愾心，並不可盲信敵人的謀略戰，宣傳戰。最近舉行的奎貝克會談，畢竟　英美的謀略戰，宜傳戰。這種宣傳實是防不勝防。尤其在上海，這傾向更爲顯著，所以無論敵方如何策動，靠着日本的經濟力、政治力，今後益趨增强之途，深切認識大東亞戰爭有着有勝無敗的基礎，向克服大東亞戰爭的國難而遇統。（鵬·翔·合　）</p>
<h3 id="c33">一個月來　倫特巴島的邀擊戰　日海空軍奮勇擊敵 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>（南太平洋某基地竹田特派員「海軍報道班員」發）大吹大擂，以一星期完全佔領所羅門島的敵人，現在自從在倫特巴島登陸以來，業已一月有餘，尙未有若何成就，在敵人前面的我們軍隊之更敢善戰在陸海空三面發揮着立體戰的妙訣，逐漸改善陣地這也就是使敵不能前進一步的主要原因。然而這一個月所羅門前綫基地我國海軍航空部隊的戰鬥情形，實非言語所能形容其壯烈程度。海鷹對於作戰態度，總是抱着不可能者使其可能的態度。敵人由倫特巴島、渡過魯比安島，擬向我們蒙達基地前進；另一方面也向蒙達後面登陸，向對岸的哥倫班拉迫近。敵人從空中，從海上，增援及補給這些登陸部隊。對於這種登陸部隊，我們的空軍及海軍配合着陸上部隊，大發揮其消滅敵人的拿手好戲。從事一個月倫特巴島邀擊戰的我們海鷹，敵人愈來，而殺氣愈勇。且赫赫戰果，一頁一頁地寫在大東亞戰史上。在所羅門島上空，一天比一天地厲害起來，敵人簡直亳不間斷地，不分盡夜地來轟炸。我所羅門羣島最前綫○○基地，戰鬥機及轟炸機的勇士們，包圍着父鷹○○司令，很高興地在談論一個月的空戰。在這個地方從思念親熱的部下的愛護心裏，說出了許多近代的空戰姿態，節是聽一下也感覺到無上壯烈。所羅門羣島的天空，現在業已成爲日善血戰的天空戰塲。藉勇士們的嘴，來看一下佩中的實際情形。</p>
<p>盡力打擊敵人航空隊司令：鞏固了瓜達卡那爾島，且奠定基地於魚塞爾的敵人，可以知道是逐漸挺逝着。他們當時，經常以五十架或一百架飛機來轟炸蒙達及哥倫班格拉的各個某地。他們大言不慚地說着。以奪取阿圖島的經騐，來攻取蒙達，因而敵方大軍殺向前來。他們的氣勢，我們可以看得很淸楚。對於這一點，我們的陸海軍精銳早已準備好了在等候着，我們航空部隊則不顧任何犧牲，飛向瓜達卡那爾島，　聲敌人的出發。</p>
<p>但敵人立刻就增加救援，一面在尋找機會攻擊，一面不時以巡洋艦和驅逐艦實行夜間砲轟我方陸上陣地。六月底，天氣始終繼續不斷地非本事。登陸前一天的廿九號，下了整天的雨。乘着這個機會，便用轟炸和砲轟我方前綫各基地的方法掌制着我們，同時在夜中用大枇運輸艦向倫特巴進發。我們部隊接到這個消息後，立刻全部飛機出動，而開始轟炸登陸地點。但正如我們所略，敵人向倫特巴島已擺佈下重砲陣地。六月三十日以來，每天不知數次，用全部航空兵力實行攻擊了。雖然犧牲非常地大，但用盡全力來打擊敵人，也必須阻擋件敵人。實際上，敵人利用這種種天氣，而大量地派出運輸艦隊，源源不絕地擁上前來。我們如實行攻擊，則定有幾分犧牲。但不顧這種犧牲竟向登陸地點襲來</p>
<p>那一個星期非常的苦。他們那些傢伙無論什麽時候走，在天空中總有三四十架飛機在盤旋着。若用戰鬥機襲擊牠們的話，而敵方艦船就湧也似地撲上來。某空軍上士，何說一下第一次攻擊的故事：</p>

<p>— 任淑芳</p>
<p>她挽着我的胳膊，暮眷的香氣從她的頭髮裏　過來，在靜安寺路這條從歐洲風光的馬路上我們慢慢地　着，腦子裏跳躍着，神經細胞吿訴我今兒是星期六。</p>
<p>想着今晚是個該興奮的日子，我喝着葡萄酒似地　着她在街燈下閃爍着的暗紫的眼皮：一菀子！今晚能陪我上舞塲嗎？」</p>
<p>她的眼睛亮了一下，然後輕盈的笑了、慢慢地　上了紫色的眼皮，街角上有人吹着。</p>
<p>忘了什麽時候，我帶了一顆通度興奮的心蹣跚地囘到家裹。脫下了染着暗紅色唇印的　衫，覺得有些頭昏起來。</p>
<p>孩子早睡了，蘋還倚在床上等，我一句話也沒有脫，倒在床上就睡了，</p>
<p>是寒假開學的時候，我在×大學還是個新敎授，下了課剛想出教室。</p>
<p>「丁先生請你跟我改下到。」</p>
<p>像一串銀鈴又拖着迷人的尾音，我囘了頭，　眞是上帝的傑作，一身毛織的黑祺袍配着黑的外套，像早春的一朶黑牡丹閃着黑玉似的大眼珠。</p>
<p>我記得下樓梯的時候，我的心快要從喉裏逃出來了。</p>
<p>第二次上課時候，我碰見她穿了一身紫衣裳，愛啦，變了一朶紫丁香啦</p>
<p>兩個月來上課，看着她黑板上寫着一連串的錯字，下課跟着她，應該囘到教員休息室裏，却隨她走出了校門。</p>
<p>蘋爲我做的挺喜歡吃的菜變得淡而無昧了，明兒肥胖的小臉也失去了</p>
<p>月老過去了，她的成續遭透了，可是我不管給了她八十分。</p>
<p>該是怎樣幸福的一個下午，當我還在實騐室中的時候，茶房送了張紙條來：</p>
<p>「丁先生：能不能請你在做完實騐的時候往校門口等我一下！菀子」</p>
<p>我馬上覺得心臟在發狂了，臉上一陣陣熱起來，望望錶離下課還有半小時，時間的足音一秒一秒地在我心上爬過，那樣慢，像挨着一個寒冷的長夜那樣的難受。</p>
<p>走到門口，看見一羣校中的男生，在喧曄地談笑，最後她來了。穿了淺藍的袍子，白的皮鞋，在髮上飄盪着的藍綢結兒，驕傲地笑着，她走向我說了些不經意的話，並肩地走出了校門，我立刻發現那些年輕的公子們失望地扮了些挨打的臉呆呆地，瞧着我們，我覺得一陣驕傲的快樂。</p>
<p>四月的郊外是花事　珊了，麥穗已經在稻田裏長得很高，農村裏到處可以聽見布穀鳥的叫聲，不知是誰家別墅裏一枝嫩紅的薔薇從　頭，伸出來，菀子上去摘了一朶替我揷在襟上，我立刻感到像一隻綿羊受到獅子的愛那樣的光榮。</p>
<p>菀子很愛說話，從她那擦着暗紫的Kiss　proof的嘴裏泛隘出甜味的軟語說着什麼，她最愛中年人的小鬍子啦，穿着深顏色的西裝是多麽莊嚴啦，反正她的每一句話都會使我的神經怏樂的一跳。</p>
<p>記得我和蘋未結婚前，我是挺喜歡蘋的說話的，可是現在我覺得蘋的說話太溫柔乏味，不夠刺激，男子是需要和豪放刺激的女性生活在一起的。</p>
<p>半年來她天天挽着我四處的跑，她從來沒有問起過我可曾結婚，也從來不曾談到我們將怎樣，發展下去，我心裏漸漸地不安起來。</p>
<p>「菀子你會不愛我喱！」我覺得不能再忍下去丁。</p>
<p>「別說　話吧，想想明天上那兒去玩！」我失望地難受着一句話也不說直到分手時，她忽然凑着我的耳朶說：</p>
<p>「我是永遠愛你的」接着在我的頰上吻了一下，飛也似的跑開了，留着我受寵若驚地站在那兒發怔，我提着興奮的步子囘到家裏，一路上想誰說中年人在情塲上該是個失敗者呢？</p>
<p>薔薇花謝了，夏天來了，學生們都爲了大考的威脅，臉上現出了不自然，在考好我的功課時，菀子告訴了我電話號碼，叫我暑假裏別忘記打電話給她，流着汗忙了幾天，改考卷蘋天天替我預備些解渴的水葉或冷飲，怕我熱壞了，可是我並不理會這些，天天腦子裏只是記着菀子：菀子：</p>
<p>考卷改好了第二天，就打電話給菀子，可是對方的囘答是壓根見就沒有這個人，一連打了六七個電話，都是一樣的囘答，我的心臟開始收縮起來，一個多月過着像下油鍋的日子。</p>
<p>天天上舞塲，用音樂和酒麻醉自已，終於碰見宛子和一個打着闊領結的男子在一次，酒吃得醉的時候，她比從前更漂亮了，帶上鑽石耳環，穿着白色細高跟鞋，她看見了我，還是像以前那樣的笑着替我介紹說：</p>
<p>「丁先生，這是我的未婚夫，我們就在秋天要舉行婚禮，到那時候謂你來吃喜酒哪！」我立刻聽見我全身的細胞都崩潰下來的聲音，不知什麽時候我出了舞塲囘到家裏，我覺得整個地球在旋轉啦！</p>
<p>想到過去慚愧和悔恨都攤上心來，不由地伏在沙發上啜泣起來。</p>
<p>蘋撫摸着我的頭髮嘆息的說：</p>
<p>「過去的不要再想了，以後做事總要考慮才奸。』</p>
<p>我抬頭奇怪地望着她，她笑了，笑得那麽溫柔</p>
<p>「你以爲我不知道嗎，有一次我在公司裏看你和那漂亮的小姐挽着走，可是我很快的避開了你們；我怕六家見了面使你難堪，」蘋的眼圈兒也紅了，又是一陣羞恨抓住了我</p>
<p>「蘋你能饒恕你的不誠實的丈夫嗎？」</p>
<p>「當然能夠親愛的」我忍不住了像孩子似地　性投在蘋的　　大哭起來</p>

<p>敵人吃了一驚</p>
<p>空軍卜士，在六月二十九日，突然接到人來　倫特巴島方面的　息，馬上就發出出動命令。我充任戰鬥機的　隊長，和其他一隊共同”惡劣氣候，在　　間鑚來鑚去。然而一到倫巴島時，天氣也就好起來了。利○○用公尺附近的　　，而或隱或現地從南方向島嶼前進的滿載貨物的運輸艦數艘，由驅逐艦保　着。因爲　近的空中沒有敵機的影踪，所以立刻便想衝鋒，當降低高度時，我的某號機就開始不斷傾斜飛行，也許有敵機出現，於是便囘頭一看，而從右面飛來二十幾架的。四克爾斯基型飛機，又從正面衝來二十幾架格拉受型飛　，所以這就發生了正面衝突。是交混到一處的空戰。</p>
<p>好像使敵人吃了一驚，最初處於劣勢的我們，立刻就由均而勢取得了　勢。這樣後，戰局則由我們來支配了。敵人爲了逃跑而故意作一下攻擊的姿勢，來攻就擊落地，逃跑就追趕牠，不到二十五分鐘的光景，則天空上全是　方的飛機了。四十分鐘候，敵機踪跡都看不見了。戰果就是這樣。</p>
<p>用機關槍掃射　　眞是期間相常長的空戰。難然曾是苦戰，　擊落了三十一架敵方飛機，也的確是一件痛怏的戰果。</p>
<p>空軍上士：七月二，三·四日，由日出至日落，敵方以四十至五十架飛機不斷地飛到了倫特巴島的上空。六月三十日，西克爾斯基型及格拉曼型等飛機，曾吃了我們的虧，所以從第二號起，雙朋飛機P38型，和P39型就來了一。帶着捕殲滅敵方戰鬥機的巨大任務。在高度○○公尺的空中，便突入了敵方的空中。曾與P38型交綏。那些傢伙們是兩架　四架爲一隊。我曾追逐二架飛機隊，但從倫特巴是開始向西北逃，他們前面有一堆亂雲。我早料到，他們飛進亂雲去，一定還會飛轉來的，於是便等　着他們，果不出所料，出來了。於是拚命飛近、而用機關槍掃射、而子彈一直地携向敵方駕駛　的位置去、竟自炸裂了。於是搖　了一下，便落下去了。這一天，P38型飛機被打下來的很多、當時找以爲敵人害怕而不敢再來了。可是第二天，P58型飛機大隊又來　，打算向我們挑戰。</p>
<p>早晚掃蕩艦艇</p>
<p>○○司令：當時，敵人向後面蒙達方面的萊士灣登陸，而戰綫更形擴大了。敵人不管消耗和損失的是多少，總有救援。眞是努力於救援的戰爭。我們方面無論怎樣消滅他們，然而他們的救援總是不斷的來。於是不分早晚日夜，無時不在掃蕩敵機和獲取海上艦艇。曾經有這樣一次事情</p>
<p>我們接到敵人在我們飛機塲的東方登陸時，我們的飛機隊馬上就出發了。我們奉令襲擊舟艇，如無舟艇則轟炸陸地點，於是便騰空而起，不大的工夫，又接到報告說，在波浪中把敵人擊退了。因爲舟艇沒有了便在內心掛念着，我門要炸自己方面的陸戰隊麼？如不按命令從事又不行，怎樣辦？正在這樣無辦法的時候，又接到命令　歸原防，於是才放心。</p>
<p>中尉：你炸敵人卞次以上麼？</p>
<p>奇襲完全成功</p>
<p>中尉：二十一號，向天襲　倫特巴港時，完全奇襲成功了。從南面轉過來，一二三地数着敵方的　逐艦和連輪船，但下面是無法覺察的。當好擋準備後俯　下去，此時敵方才覺察出來，於是便手忙脚　地開始射擊，但那時已經晚了。他們完全成爲我們的　中物，差不多也可以說用不着投彈竟自自己沉入海底。去逐艦迅速地想逃　，但朱及動而竟被擊沉了。滿載着貨物人　來的大型運輸船，也全部受到直擊彈，而沉入海底了。這一天的攻擊，眞可以說，完全成功了。</p>
<p>某司令：因爲是補給增援的競賽，所以近來在海洋上展開了很可觀的夜戰。保衛艦隊的飛機，便又展開了空戰。某中尉也在十三號那天擊落格拉曼型飛機了吧！</p>
<p>天明時獲勝仗某中尉：把敵方的驅逐艦和巡洋艦，按着自己所想的樣子擊沉了。是在夜戰之夜，將近天明的時候，這是我們　　　了勝仗得意揚揚地走而歸途，而我們就飛向曾發生海戰的天空去，須臾間，看到兩艘驅逐艦在不斷地團繞着一艘大破的軍艦兜圈圈。爲了看　更淸楚。我們　降低高度，開始繞灣。於是下面的驅逐艦就突然「轟」的一聲向我們放了一下高射砲，啊！我們才曉得　是敵人。然而圍繞着的這個奇怪的艦，究竟是否我們的呢？再詳細一看，才知道是敵艦被炸成　半了，只從煙囪向前的一部份尙留在海面漂浮着。兩艘　逐艦想救護牠。驅逐艦不斷地開砲。這種情況下眞沒有辦法，最可惜沒有炸彈。無奈只好於幾排機關槍，於是敵方戰鬥機格拉曼型來救援了。而突然改爲空戰，打落十一架　機後就囘來了。因爲　在是奇怪的艘型。最初眞不明白，原來是軍艦的一半。這從來還沒見過。</p>
<p>讓同行機攻擊</p>
<p>○○中尉：曾是約一星期前的事。夜裏襲擊倫特巴島走上歸途的時候，在極　。天氣很壞。從君端　出來時·突然在眼前出　了黑影的船·是好幾　。　可不錯，在心中遭機想養，何從遠方慢慢旋下去·仔細一看，原來是敵方的巡洋艦和　逐艦·眞可惜·發見敵人而無炸彈·同就讓同行機攻·在近處　了一個大圓圈·慢慢地　高、在雲端突然降下　行機關槍掃射。一直到這個時個前·敵艦隊好　都拿我們當自己人。同行機也向下投彈後便躱飛開·　大爲吃驚的敵人·雖然看到我們飛機已經飛得很遠了·但仍然不斷地亂放　射砲和重砲。　　不屈不撓戰鬥</p>
<p>○○司令：　之·敵方東西多·所以在這樣不屈不撓的戰鬥中·我們也需要更形精誠團結·必須有堅　小敗的決心才可以·敵人對於我方的○○基地·毫不間斷地、不分爽夜地來襲擊·大型機和小型機大機羣。亳無規則地使用着。如我們少微不注意，　立刻會被其所乘。月光明朗夜，當然亳無問　地要來·不管我們的戰鬥　打下他們多少，他們總還是不斷地飛來他們以為即使少微給我們一望打　也好·這慢慢積累起來，也會發生效果的、這一點　們不能不注意·這二四型。？（原文脫掉）二型·B一七型等轟炸機·在戰鬥機的直接掩護下飛來了，不時投落着炸彈，我們很不高興自己在方面的上空與敵機交綏·○○中尉：因為沒有知這敵人已經來了·所以正想　隊著　。於是　覺得塲內有點奮怪。　著手　擺的的人也有。我正在想這眞奇怪！原來是敵人來空襲　出。於是，我們飛到高空去。找到　已由飛機塲內飛的自己方面之飛機·協力進行空戰·</p>
<p>○○司令：那時候敵人來了大型機二十一架·小型機數十架。前些日子這樣大的機羣也會來空襲過，竟　落下來二十三架。我一發空襲警報就到　　臺上去　　。大家精誠團結某司令：士軍的旺盛，軍心的振作，這就是帝國軍人的精神，所以用不着担心。祗希望大家經常注意，是否大家精誠團結。目前會發生　這樣事情。敵方連度最快的飛機P三八型，在非當高的空中來偵察，當時恰有一位新到任的戰鬥機駕駛員，在上空放哨。不知怎樣辦，只看到敵機努力向他開駛接近。一着走也無希望了，然而不知　樣一下便把敵機擊落了。當他著陸時，全體航空員都向他鼓掌致賀歡迎他。因為還同大家不大熟識的航空員·總在內心裏担心着。但看到這種情形。便眉飛色舞。</p>
<p>比較受害最多的俯衝　炸機隊出發的時候，全體航空員揮帽歡送。實夠得上一心一德。精誠團結·集合　多人。最困難的要經常強調這一點，如一有機會就臨當　出加以伸說。總之，絕不要緊的·像這樣大家和睦而且强盛的隊員·除掉日本，是看不到的。（漢譯）</p>

<h3 id="c41">今夏的上海游泳　保持相當成績 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>昨日全滬公開游泳賽溫敬令八百碼成績佳</p>
<p>熱的長夏，快要過去了，囘　今夏上海的游泳，因種種關係，情形與往年稍有不同，游泳池開放的不多。査公開開放的，只有下列幾處：張　游泳池，虹口游泳池。四川路青年會。西僑青年會：法商總會等。比較往年盛况，稍覺遜色。</p>
<p>各游泳池槪况</p>
<p>張　興虹口游泳池。地方都很好。可　張　收費高，而虹口游泳池又遠在江灣路上，交通不很方便。去游泳的人都不多。四川路青年會游泳池，採取團體游泳方法，收費較低，本季參加者有一千六百多人，但不是隨便可以去玩的。四僑青年會游泳池，今年僅限保甲青年團團員，和該會會　參加。至於法商總會游泳池，全是爲外僑而設的。</p>
<p>成績尙稱優良</p>
<p>講到游泳人才與成績方面在缺少游泳池的情况下，當然受到很大的影響，但昨日舉行的全滬公開華人游泳比賽中，仍保持着相當的人才與成績，這是很足以慶幸的。如溫敬令王中成白　廉許守强刁國華陳景忠陸惠傑等，都是成績優異的。女游泳　方　，人數雖不多，但　天脊程錦倩沈　明等，皆女中俊傑，每次比賽，都得到熱烈的掌聲。</p>
<p>游泳　強身最好的一種運動。也是夏天最好玩的一種運動，可惜目前因游泳衣之昂貴門票之高價，已變成貴族化的東西，希望明年夏季，能普遍提倡，並多　游泳池，使多數人享受到水上運動的樂趣。</p>
<p>昨日比賽盛况</p>
<p>上海市體育　與中華青年會合辦之全滬公開游泳於昨日下午五時，在四川路靑年會舉行，情况熱烈。其結果可代表本年全滬華人游泳的成績。各項成績雖不及　年之佳，但溫敬令八百碼自由式。可謂一種良好的收獲。又自由式短距離，覇王本爲溫敬令，但溫放棄六卞碼白由式，而參加向來不嘗試的四百和八百。結果　然全部得到第一，而獲個人　標，眞是　風至極。同時仰泳老將王中成之能繼續保持六十　百碼仰泳首席，而壓倒　守強，成績　不錯。後起小將白威廉。預言明年在短距離，自由式中在上海可壓倒。其他老將倒是後生可畏。對於女子方面。參加旣不參加，臨陣又多脫逃，成績當然不好。沈　明繼續游泳四項，結果雖然不像男女溫敬令的都得到第一，然而其精　實得欽　！（劉荷生）</p>

<p>足球是球類中最使人矚目的游戲，因為他能號召大量的觀衆，尤其是今夏的足球，竟然成爲白熱化。今天一個慈着　，明天一個奪標賽，球員們忙得走頭無路。球員技術猛晉，夏天踢足球雖然似乎失時，然足球人才輩出，亦可為前途慶。</p>
<p>足球季節臨，滬上各球隊，莫不大事準備。聘將拉角，招軍買馬，東拉西湊，華人球隊除東華聯誼外，尙有異軍突起之三省。三隊成爲三　甲。</p>
<p>東華</p>
<p>風純爲海派，目下人才稍形凋落。基本隊員，僅張邦綸·莊及仁。戴麟經·賈幼良·張昭　·許文奎·王錫勝。韓龍海等八人。近聞　孫錦順，張林根兩將，有加入消息吳炳浩將重作馮婦，効勞母隊。如果能成事實，東華即可恢復全盛時代局面。守將張邦綸近來埋頭苦練，大有壓倒聯誼劉顯漢之勞。兩衛莊友仁·張林根·莊穩健·張潑辣，配置得當。中堅飛將軍韓龍海坐鎭中央，有萬夫莫敵之感，出將入相，輔以張昭　王錫勝扶助。五鋒阿　主師，衝鋒昭城，許女　任右鋒，此公雖球路廣泛，惟體力不及他人·老孫駐　有術，越陳越　，兩　爲買幼良·吳炳　·為全滬最佳之右翼，無論街剌，傳　有恰到好處之妙。吳炳浩久離滬濱，脫離球壇數年，此番東山再起，必不同凡響。　觀東華全隊，已無暇可擊，陣容之整齊，可稱冠全滬。</p>
<p>聯誼</p>
<p>聯誼爲去年全滬最　秀隊伍導中四　雄，爲華人爭　不少光榮。隊中泰半爲　將。本季因人事變遷，有潰不成軍之勢，如卓石金省親未返·張林根孫錦　之脫輻。雖後補有人·實力究竟大遜。現該　極有大將劉顯漢李天生宋　聖吳祺祥李義臣高保正　春華孟義良鄭其權蔡聲淼矍永福等十一員。至於孫張卓三人之遺缺，吳祺祥以補卓石金，孟義良暫改張林根，孫錦順之左鋒由鄭英權庖代·當能支持局面。</p>
<p>三省</p>
<p>三省爲新興勁旅以徐　爲基本。陣中均屬後起之秀·不乏能征慣戰之士。周德法之驛悍善戰，高致文之身手矯健，　遠智之　敏刦截·鐘　　之射門　準·皆為突出人　。該隊志在歡　，不在奪標。聞該隊主持人將赴港澳聘請良材之訊。</p>

<p>— 湯姆著一德譯</p>
<p>一·如何直立</p>
<p>健身之道，第一在身體有正確之姿勢，第二在如何維持之姿勢·蓋不僅為美觀起見，而實與傳廣攸關，此其所以重要也</p>
<p>欲作此姿勢·當倚牆而立，先以足跟觸牆，然　使身體之其他部份，多靠着牆·頭亦向後，而枕於牆·　微向內·作此姿势時，可見其胸部擴張·肌肉強固，因此能保持胸腔之位置，不隨呼吸而張縮。</p>
<p>以上不過為達到目的之一種方法、乃趨向正確姿勢之第一步也。使全體姿勢向前，而兩足不動·除踝關節外·其他關節，亦皆不動。由此可見正確之姿勢，為一個自動的（堅固的）胸腔，腹部縮進·身體之重心離跟·全體正直。</p>
<p>人有肥胖之趨向·則其身體必向後移，胸腔下陷，而腹部隆起，與正確之姿勢，適得其反。</p>
<p>二·如何行走</p>
<p>行走之時·身體　穩定，由兩腿担任工作。胸部前導（切勿腹部向前），趾根與足跟，　於同時着地</p>
<p>於身體　　之後，行走數步，其最初之衝動，一若來自　部者·此時　覺步履輕快，給爲平昔所未　經歷·閱時不久，常可成爲第二天性，非作此正確之姿勢，必惑不適矣</p>
<p>三·如何安坐</p>
<p>人若不知如何坐法，　非天下之奇事·然雖知如何坐，而不知如何爲　　有力之坐法者，比比皆是。讀者如疑予言，請觀學校中之兒窒，寫字　前之書記以及任何人於就食之際，　坐法如何。大抵坐椅離桌太近，以致人向前倚，　柱曲灣體內之重要器官，如心·胃·興肝，被擠在一處。消化不良。肝功遲鈍，心動作不規則，與頭痛等等，皆爲其必然之結果。</p>
<p>故坐於椅中之時，身體宜盡力向後，但勿靠着椅背·脊柱　直，如在直立之正確姿勢。如此可令脊柱之底，得有支持，身體坐時，可於體部自由動轉，一如直立之時，可於踝關節自由動轉。坐椅之地位，亦不可太近　桌或餐桌。</p>
<p>四·如何休息</p>
<p>世間能知如何休應之人，何其少也。坐而不動，非即等於休息。若欲完全休息，必須肌肉放鬆，身心弛懈，頭與手足，全體俱得休息。若倚身椅中。自覺可以　爲安　，更爲滿足、不妨向後倚靠，而將一切沉悶之思想，悉數排遺，驅之於烏無有之鄕。</p>
<p>在諸書寫字之時，如覺精神疲倦，腦經漸欠活與理會之能力。最　之法，莫若附事運動，如使足跟緩緩提起，足尖着地，约行四五十次。此法可引血雖　，以供給肌肉，而組成，結果可以增加腦之活動，而無不良效果。</p>
<p>身體與　，尤其是腦神經最佳之休息時間，乃在午時以後，此爲人人應有之休息。</p>
<p>五·隨意睡眼</p>
<p>此為西班牙式之　　。在西班牙與墨西哥等國，氣　炎熱，長日體　，不得不作　寢，然在北方諸國，午後小睡，亦不可少。所不同者，西班牙人之盡寢，諸兩三小時，我入睡，或使兩分鐘內，即可法即由於一種自我催眠作用。</p>
<p>六·自我催眠</p>
<p>飽　之後，不可平臥，以免消化器擁擠。坐在安樂椅中，頭枕　背而睡，或無論何種坐椅皆可，祇須靠略高，使頭枕着其上。椅須稍向後限，　足擱在一同樣高之椅上。或較所坐之椅略高。兩足在踝處交叉，雙手合抱，手指相交，拇指未端之肌肉，並在一處。閉　　神，作深呼吸。此時隊默數緩而有而之呼吸外。屛除一切雜念，即可於兩　鐘內熟睡。第一次試驗，或未必有效，然經　次練習之後，即可隨心所欲。臨睡時警醒自己於十五會鐘内醒來，幾可絲亳不爽。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Strict Official Conduct <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>On the third of this month, we published an article titled "Importance of Political Responsibility," in which we stated that the government should emphasize responsibility for dereliction of duty by officials, clearly define rewards and punishments, and not merely dismiss officials. Politics without accountability leads to a lack of discipline, right and wrong, and efficiency. We specifically emphasized: "The revival of the Chinese nation and the stability of people's lives depend on the integrity of politics, which must begin with clear rewards and punishments." We are aware that our tone may have been stern and our emotions intense, but we dare say that our attitude of protecting the government is very frank and pure.</p>
<p>In that commentary, we cited two examples. The first concerned a lapse in inspection by a police precinct chief in this city. We have since received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Government Secretariat. In addition to publishing the full text of the original letter after this commentary, we feel compelled to add a few words.</p>
<p>First, we must state that in any of our discussions or examples, we have never dared to distort the facts or blindly follow the crowd. If our arguments are based on inaccuracies or are biased, we will openly accept corrections and never shirk responsibility. We will call "yes" what is "yes" and "no" what is "no," and will not attempt to reverse the truth. We do not want to sensationalize or fabricate stories to cater to public opinion. Moreover, the general public has no time to be happy about official misconduct. If, as reporters, we were to distort the facts in order to cater to public opinion, it would be akin to reveling in misfortune, which we consider most undesirable. The example we cited was also based on some evidence, but we are not at liberty to elaborate here. A separate letter of reply has been prepared, and we believe the authorities will sympathize with our position. Because we dare not remain silent about what we believe is dangerous, we will speak frankly, even if it is unpleasant for public opinion or a few individuals to hear. We have maintained this attitude consistently since our republication at the end of last year. As for right and wrong, praise and blame, society will make its own judgment, and we neither calculate nor desire to calculate it.</p>
<p>Generally, when politics are not on track and the system of selection and examination for officials has not yet been established, two common phenomena occur. One is that low-level officials often try to ingratiate themselves with new superiors, or seek promotion, by taking the opportunity to extort money from the people as "tribute." The other is that newly appointed superiors often instruct their subordinates to initiate "tribute," and if things go wrong, the subordinates bear the responsibility. This phenomenon has actually been discovered in our city. Fortunately, the municipal government has taken measures to maintain official discipline and has imposed penalties of dismissal and transfer. Such virtuous measures are naturally worthy of admiration and are truly welcomed by public opinion. At the same time, we feel that the authorities should not wait for the matter to be brought up in public before taking corrective action; rather, they should make it public as soon as possible to inform the public.</p>
<p>We believe that this statement from the municipal government has two major implications. First, in the future, if people encounter similar situations of official misconduct, they will no longer be deceived. We also hope that the authorities will allow citizens to report such incidents at any time. Second, in the future, responsible officials at all levels will be vigilant about their subordinates' actions to avoid damaging their own integrity. In this way, the phenomenon of official misconduct can be eradicated once and for all, and the political track can be established from now on. How fortunate! How fortunate!</p>

<p>To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Regarding the commentary in your newspaper on September 3 concerning bribery by the police precinct chief, the facts have been investigated and found to be untrue. The incident was that a former employee of the precinct, in an attempt to ingratiate himself with his superiors and seize the opportunity to collect money, consulted with a few local residents about raising funds to offer gifts to the precinct chief. The precinct chief never received a single cent. The former employee was subsequently dismissed. However, due to the precinct chief's failure to report the matter to the municipal government beforehand, a punishment of dismissal was imposed to maintain official discipline. This penalty is considered excessive in light of normal circumstances. Your newspaper's hasty criticism, without thorough investigation, initially deviated from the facts. While public opinion is pleased to hear such reports, it is essential to base arguments on facts. We hope that in the future, if your newspaper has any unclear facts, it will conduct interviews before making comments so as not to betray the great reputation your newspaper has enjoyed for decades, as well as the power of public opinion. We also hope that you will publish this letter in your newspaper to dispel doubts and clarify the truth.</p>
<p>With best wishes,</p>
<p>Secretariat of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government</p>

<h3 id="e3">Inspection Mission Completed, Minister Aoki of Japan Returns Home, Visit to China and Manchuria of Great Significance <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, September 5 (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 5:30 PM: Minister Aoki of Japan's Greater East Asia Ministry recently visited the Republic of China and Manchukuo, and having completed his mission, arrived in Fukuoka at 5:30 PM on the afternoon of the 5th.</p>
<p>Fengtian, September 5 (Central News Agency) - Minister Aoki of Japan's Greater East Asia Ministry issued a statement upon leaving Manchuria, the gist of which is as follows: I have long desired to visit Manchukuo to express my gratitude for the enormous contributions it has made since the Greater East Asia War, to hold earnest talks with key figures in Manchukuo, and to personally observe the conditions of various local institutions. I am deeply gratified to have been able to fulfill these wishes this time. The construction of Manchukuo in the past ten years is truly astonishing to the world, and while Japan has taken up arms to free the nations of Asia from the shackles of the United States and Britain, Manchukuo has also devoted all its efforts to actively cooperate. In addition to guarding the northern border, it has also provided iron, food, and other extremely important resources and materials to support the war effort. All of these contributions are enormous and deeply appreciated. Furthermore, I was deeply moved by the strict training and security conditions of the Kwantung Army, which bears the heavy responsibility of guarding the important northern border. Before visiting Manchukuo, I first visited the Republic of China, where I witnessed the current state of affairs, with China steadily improving its construction policies and cooperating with Japan to live and die together in the Greater East Asia War. Now, I have also witnessed the flourishing development of Manchukuo and its determination to strengthen the unity between Japan and Manchukuo, which has further strengthened my belief in the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Satisfied with the Progress of Policies towards China</p>
<p>Tokyo, September 5 (Central News Agency) - According to political observers here: Minister Aoki of Japan's Greater East Asia Ministry completed his mission to visit the Republic of China and Manchukuo and returned to Japan on the 5th. It is remembered that Minister Aoki visited Thailand, Vietnam, and other southern regions in April of this year, and now he has also visited China and Manchukuo, which shows that the enemy's propaganda is worthless. Especially at a time when China is developing steadily from an East Asian perspective, its significance is even more profound. Minister Aoki's visit to China was to inspect in detail the actual situation in China after Japan implemented its new policies, and to hold earnest talks with Chinese government officials on concrete ways to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, with the development of Chinese affairs as the background. In this regard, he was able to contact the realities of various regions of China and to personally inspect the concrete situation of the implementation of new policies by the Japanese side. Therefore, it goes without saying that the result is a more optimistic view of the promotion of new policies. At the same time, based on the actual situation, a clear direction was also obtained regarding future policies towards China and concrete measures for Sino-Japanese cooperation. Moreover, during Minister Aoki's visit to China, he met with President Wang of the National Government for earnest talks, and held frank and open discussions with Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, and Zhou Fohai, Minister of Finance of the National Government, Zhu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mei Siping, Minister of Industry, and greatly achieved the purpose of communicating the intentions of China and Japan. Secondly, in Shanghai, he also held earnest talks with Chinese and Japanese political figures. In the political field, such as the fundamental revision of the basic treaty between China and Japan, and in other fields, such as the concrete expression of measures for materials and prices, the promotion of current problems has had a profound impact and is worthy of attention. Minister Aoki's visit to China and Manchukuo is most worthy of showing to the world that China, Japan, and Manchukuo have formed the core of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the fact that they are cooperating on the same front to implement the Greater East Asia War, and that the strategies for future cooperation between the three countries will become more concrete, and the significance of this visit is extremely significant.</p>

<p>Jinan, September 5 (Central News Agency) - The war situation of the elite Japanese army against the remaining troops of the Chongqing Communist forces in central Shandong is as follows: The Japanese army's expeditionary force began its operations on August 18th. On the 20th, it learned that more than 100 bandits from Wang Jizhen's unit were lurking in the Xingcun Zhangjin (26 kilometers east of Changqiu) area, and immediately launched a fierce attack on them. In about an hour of battle, it killed 40 enemies, captured 48 enemies, and seized 44 rifles. Subsequently, in Zhang'erzhuang (14 kilometers northeast of Zhangqiu) and Liguanzhuang (18 kilometers northeast of Licheng County), it suppressed about 800 bandits from Yue Bofen's unit, the 13th Brigade of the Shandong Security Forces of Chongqing, killing 35 enemies, capturing 359 enemies, and seizing one mortar, one light machine gun, 113 rifles, 1,342 rounds of ammunition, and 209 hand grenades, achieving great war results. Another unit of the Japanese army attacked about 180 Communist bandits near Zhaozhuang (15 kilometers north of Wucheng County) and Beilinzhuang (about 5 miles west of Zhaozhuang) on August 18th and 19th. As a result, 40 enemies were killed, 10 enemies were captured, and 31 rifles were seized. Another unit of the Japanese army launched a punitive war in the eastern area of Tai'an County from August 20th. By dawn on the 22nd, it advanced to Shenghuan (about 25 kilometers east of Tai'an County) and suppressed about 300 bandits from the 1st Military Sub-district of the Communist Army, annihilating them all and seizing 40 rifles, 2 light machine guns, and 2 pistols. On August 26th, in the Taipingzhuang area in the southeast of Tai'an County, it suppressed a unit of the Communist Army (the 10th Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Chen Ming). After about half an hour of battle, the enemy was defeated and fled, abandoning 15 corpses, with more than 10 captured, and 17 rifles seized.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, September 5 (Central News Agency) - Although the US-Chongqing Air Force has suffered heavy losses, it is still desperately trying to counterattack. At 3:10 PM on the 4th, it again came to the Guangzhou area with 13 (P/40) aircraft and 9 (P/25) aircraft. After the Japanese Army Air Force took off to intercept, two of them were confirmed to have been shot down.

<p>Madrid, September 5 (Central News Agency) - According to news from Larini: A submarine attack occurred near Gibraltar yesterday morning. Gibraltar issued a submarine alert and immediately opened fire, using depth charges. It was also learned that there are currently about 50 merchant ships in the port of Algeciras, 20 of which are a convoy that arrived from the Atlantic Ocean yesterday morning.

<h3 id="e8">British Troops Land in Southern Italy, Establish Bridgehead, Seeking Passages to Advance Inland <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Rome, September 5 (Central News Agency) - The Overseas News Agency reported that the Italian army announced yesterday that British troops have established a bridgehead in Calabria and are seeking passages to enter the interior. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces' occupation of Reggio is to protect their flanks. However, the most important locations are San Giovanni and Sals, because they are located in the northwest corner of the Strait of Messina. If these locations are occupied, the anti-Axis forces will often gain two passages to enter the interior. The bridgehead established by the British troops allows them to advance from the east and southeast, but the use of tanks will be greatly limited.</p>
<p>Berlin, September 5 (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>German News Agency: The anti-Axis countries' repeated attempts to land in Reggio have been repelled by the German army. There are still battles occurring in the area, but the Axis forces do not expect to have major battles here, as the mountainous terrain is sufficient to prevent the movement of motorized troops. The traffic in Calabria is very unfavorable, and the better roads are only along the coast. The US army is now abandoning the British army to difficult circumstances. Because the US army suffered too much damage in Sicily, it will still not participate in the landing operation, or General Eisenhower may want his troops to land in another place, it is not yet known. The ships concentrated in Bizerte and Tunis may be reserved for the US army and French rebels to use for landing.</p>

Some parts of the city suffered considerable damage, and some people were killed and injured. The German air defense forces shot down 27 British aircraft.</p>
<p>Lisbon, September 5 (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch: The British Air Force bombed Berlin on the night of the 3rd, dropping ten tons of bombs in just twenty minutes. When the British Air Force announced this on the 4th, it stated that a total of two bombers were lost.</p>

<p>Rome, September 5 (Central News Agency) - Former Italian Foreign Minister Ciano disappeared from his villa in Rome last week and was discovered and arrested by the police on Friday and is now under strict guard. The authorities learned of Ciano's whereabouts from someone who gave Ciano some subtle task, and that person has been arrested and interrogated severely. But the arrest of Ciano was extremely difficult because he was sheltered by foreigners who had obtained diplomatic privileges, but this difficulty was overcome. Ciano was arrested when he left his hiding place, and it is rumored that his wife was also arrested at the same time, but this has not been confirmed. It is still not possible to determine how he escaped police surveillance and left his villa in Rome.</p>

<p>Stockholm, September 5 (Central News Agency) - According to news from the Eastern Front received here: The Soviet forces' operational goal in the Donbas region is to recapture the heavy industrial center of Stalingrad, bypassing it to the north via Taganrog to cut off the railway to Mariupol. Fierce battles have been fought between German and Soviet forces for control of the transportation lines northeast of Stalingrad since the night of the 3rd. As of the 4th, the main battle line extended southward from Nikitovka, 50 kilometers north of Stalingrad, eastward through Garlovka, and from Twarzewo to Kutshelenikowo. According to the Soviet Information Bureau's announcement on the 4th, the Soviet forces at Kutshelenikowo reached Elovaisk, 30 kilometers east of Stalingrad, and then turned westward, directly attacking Stalingrad. However, this has not been confirmed by the Axis side. The Soviet forces north of Stalingrad attempted to advance westward through Nikitovka and Garlovka to attack Krasnoarmeyskoye, attempting to cut off the retreat route of the German forces in the Donbas region. However, the German forces fiercely counterattacked, and the two armies launched a war of attrition with mechanized units. Although the German forces are doing their best to prevent the Soviet forces from advancing, the battle situation is still serious.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Anglo-American Sacrifice of Small Countries, Anti-Axis Countries Launch Secession Movement <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The anti-Axis front, led by Britain and the United States, includes a total of 33 entities, including small countries and governments-in-exile. These small countries are not only disregarded by Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and others, but also become sacrifices for Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to carry out their wars and are used by them, so they are extremely resentful of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>In the Quebec Conference, the small countries were completely ignored, so the anti-Axis countries in Europe and Central and South America are quite uneasy about their future.</p>
<p>War Aims Not Consistent</p>
<p>Although the agenda of the Quebec Conference is said to have included discussions on the relationship between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and small countries during the war and in the future, as well as the reaffirmation of the Atlantic Charter, the words and deeds of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union do not take into account the sovereignty of small countries, and only consider how to sacrifice small countries to adjust the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union; and how to deal with European problems during and after the war. The anti-Axis United Nations, as claimed by Britain and the United States, have completely inconsistent war aims, so their combination is extremely fragile.</p>
<p>Governments-in-Exile Actually Claim Alliance</p>
<p>The so-called anti-Axis United Nations include the United States, Britain (including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the South African Federation), the Soviet Union, Chongqing, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Cuba, Costa Rica, Iraq, Nicaragua, the Netherlands, Panama, Mexico, Belgium, Greece, Peru, Egypt, Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Norway, Colombia, Venezuela, Iran, Ecuador, Abyssinia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Luxembourg, etc. Among these 33 countries, in addition to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, not only are they weak and powerless countries, but also such countries as the Netherlands, Greece, Belgium, Norway, Yugoslavia, Luxembourg, Poland, and Czechoslovakia are governments-in-exile without a country, and Britain actually calls them allies, which is ridiculous. Roosevelt and Churchill use the Atlantic Charter as the political, ideological, and moral foundation of the anti-Axis countries to preserve the independence of small countries, which is completely a blank check. Churchill replied to a member of the British House of Commons on July 14, "The Atlantic Charter is not a treaty, so its amendment does not need to be negotiated with each government." It can be seen that the Atlantic Charter does not have any binding force, and Britain itself has no responsibility.</p>
<p>Norwegian Leader Publishes Book to Expose</p>
<p>British Deputy Prime Minister Attlee also openly declared in the House of Commons on July 18 that it is necessary to cede territory to ensure the safety of anti-Axis countries. Dr. Hans Böro, the leader of the Norwegian government-in-exile, expressed the most anger about the Anglo-American policy of obliterating small countries. In his recent book "The Road to Victory," he attacked the Anglo-American deceitful policies as follows:</p>
<p>"The United States and Britain pretend to hope to restore the sovereignty of small countries and respect their political rights, but small countries cannot do anything without the recognition of the United States and Britain. The Anglo-American imperialists completely disregard small countries and arbitrarily divide the world, and put pressure on governments. Therefore, the small countries of Europe are like meat on a chopping board, at the mercy of Britain and the United States."</p>
<p>He further listed examples of how Norway was sacrificed for Britain and the United States, so the British government banned the sale of the book. The death of Polish government-in-exile Prime Minister Sikorski and his daughter's entourage in a plane crash near Gibraltar on July 5 is unknown. The tragic death of the people truthfully illustrates the fate of small countries. The feelings of the small countries in Central and South America are exactly the same. A few days ago, the Colombian Foreign Minister proposed to Venezuela, Paraguay, Ecuador, Chile, and other countries to immediately convene a joint Latin American conference, and it is necessary to clarify their positions and unite today on the issues of upholding sovereignty and the issues that will arise after the war. The Anglo-American imperialists' aggression against the sovereignty of small countries is openly expressed in their recent policies towards neutral countries. The United States used all means such as bribery, purchase, conspiracy, intimidation, and oppression to make all Latin American countries except Argentina return to the anti-Axis camp. Due to these various examples, the small countries have thoroughly recognized the ambitions of Anglo-American imperialism and are only trying to escape their clutches and engage in the defense of their sovereignty and territory.

<p>The National Commercial Control Association's office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has been ordered to handle the purchase of yarn and cloth and the supplementary registration of yarn and cloth. Since the start of the announcement, the owners or occupants of yarn and cloth in the Shanghai area have filled out sales application forms and sales summary tables and supplementary registration forms, and the yarn and cloth retailers and manufacturers or occupants have enthusiastically obtained and submitted the forms to the office. Because the deadline is today (6th), the office was open as usual yesterday (5th), even though it was a public holiday, to accept applications as much as possible. The Central News Agency reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the office yesterday, and was told that because there are many people in the city holding yarn and cloth, the time for those who apply for sale or supplementary registration in accordance with the law may not be enough. Therefore, the acceptance of applications will be extended until 12:00 PM today (6th). After this time, they will be confiscated and punished according to the law. The city's cloth industry association, cloth factory industry association, and yarn factory joint association have already filled out the sales application forms for all their members and forwarded them to the office. There are still retailers or occupants whose yarn and cloth can be filled out and submitted to the office for sale tonight. The price of each yarn and cloth merchant's sales of yarn and cloth is being determined by the Sino-Japanese Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Quality Price Determination Committee, which is jointly established by the office and the Japanese Cotton Cloth Management Affairs Bureau. The committee is divided into cotton yarn department, white blank cotton cloth department, and processed cotton cloth department, and has been holding small group meetings to study and determine the price. It is expected that the price will be determined within four days, and after being reviewed and determined by the National Commercial Control Association and the Japanese Embassy, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation, and will be purchased and put into storage. The types of yarn and cloth to be purchased are listed as follows.</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch. The Japanese Ministry of the Navy announced on the 4th that Count Hiroyasu Fushimi, a captain in the Japanese Navy, bravely died for his country in the southwestern Pacific in late August. Colonel Matsushima, head of the press department of the Japanese Fleet in China, made the following statement on the 5th: "It is with utmost grief that I report that Naval Captain Count Hiroyasu Fushimi engaged in combat with enemy aircraft in the southwestern Pacific, was unfortunately wounded, and died. Although Count Hiroyasu came from a noble family, he still led by example, entering and exiting fierce battlefields filled with smoke and fire, setting a model for soldiers. Not only naval officers and soldiers, but all 100 million compatriots are deeply moved. I was a classmate at the Naval Academy with Count Hiroyasu's elder brother, Prince Hiroyoshi Fushimi, and under the strict education of their father, Prince Fushimi, the entire family devoted themselves to the Imperial Navy, for which I am deeply grateful. Since the death of Prince Hiroyoshi, all classmates have expressed deep sorrow. Although I did not directly serve closely with Count Hiroyasu, in Showa 9 (1934), when Count Hiroyasu departed on a long-distance voyage, I happened to be in the Naval Military Education Department, engaged in film production. On that day, due to filming a scene in 'The Great Japanese Maritime Nation,' I had the opportunity to film his departure. Our connection was predestined. Also, when he served in the Naval General Staff, I often went to the General Staff for other business and always saw the Count diligently performing his duties. I can still recall it to this day. This time, his unfortunate and heroic death, and thinking again of the death of Prince Hiroyoshi, evokes only overwhelming emotion and grief. In addition to expressing heartfelt condolences with our 100 million compatriots, we will also strengthen our determination to win the decisive battle."</p>

<p>The second batch of coal bricks for cooked water stores, co-organized by the coal industry association, is scheduled to begin sales on the 9th, lasting for five days until 12:00 noon on the 13th. The coal bricks supplied this time are a type of bituminous coal, with a limit of six *jin* per household, totaling 420 tons. The management of Yitai Xing, Junchang, Sun Bo Yuan, Tongcheng, and Dachang five coal companies is still entrusted with the sales. At that time, each registered cooked water store must have the store owner personally bring the store name, address, and name stamp to the Cooked Water Industry Association to apply for certification, then take the certificate to the Coal Industry Association for endorsement before paying the above coal companies to pick up the goods. However, it is still limited to the coal bricks for cooked water stores in the First and Eighth Districts, Nanshi, Huxi, and north of the Suzhou River. The supply for these areas will be temporarily delayed and managed by the Hongkou Coal Small Merchant Association. The Cooked Water Industry Association is currently negotiating with the association in good faith and hopes to achieve satisfactory results.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Some Opinions on the School Authorities <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuo Rong</p>
<p>In its commentary on the 25th of last month, Shen Bao described the crisis in Shanghai education and, in order to eliminate this crisis, advocated starting with actively improving the treatment of faculty and staff. On the other hand, it forcibly ordered students to practice ethics. (This crisis and the solution should be valued by dedicated educators, especially the education authorities. The author only considers the student's position and raises some points that are currently or generally neglected in the educational implementation of most universities and middle schools for reference.) Hopefully, in the cry to eliminate the crisis in education, all levels can work together to reverse the situation.</p>
<p>Develop Students' Group Life</p>
<p>The purpose of school education is not only to impart knowledge and skills, but more importantly, to cultivate healthy citizens both physically and mentally. However, most schools in Shanghai have now become institutions that only impart knowledge, neglecting the responsibility of moral education for students, and even ignoring students' extracurricular activities, allowing them to develop freely. This kind of deformed phenomenon should be corrected. Originally, the most valuable aspect of school education lies in allowing students to genuinely enjoy the training of group life. (Because only under the proper atmosphere of group life can young people's enthusiasm, vigorous energy, and ability to handle affairs be reasonably and fully developed, and the spirit of patriotism, discipline, and enthusiastic service can be cultivated.) But judging from the current situation, students come to school, sit in the classroom for a few hours, and after class, everyone disperses and does their own thing. Some student groups within the school are either abolished or exist in name only. Looking at it this way, the relationship between classmates is like a plate of loose sand, lacking a spirit of unity, not to mention the gap between teachers and students. Even among classmates in the same department and grade, there are those who do not know each other due to a lack of opportunities for contact. This situation is very common in schools that implement the credit system, because each person's selected subjects are not entirely the same, and sometimes the same subject is taught in different classes. Students have few opportunities to contact and communicate with each other, so it is difficult for them to understand each other. The so-called sincere and mutual exchange of feelings is even more out of the question. I dare to say boldly that the above-mentioned characteristics of group life have no special effect in such circumstances. Because of this, ugly incidents of students engaging in brawls due to temporary emotional excitement have occurred. These kinds of incidents sufficiently prove that students have not been influenced by group life, but the school authorities' lack of leadership cannot escape blame. Therefore, I feel that in order to revive the honest and earnest academic atmosphere, it is necessary to rectify all student groups within the school, so that they can exert their original functions, connect all students, and work together in the three aspects of knowledge, morality, and physical education. Only after the relationship between students is close can the relationship between teachers and students be integrated. In this way, we can eliminate the students' selfish attitude and the extreme development of individualism, and at the same time prevent them from developing a atmosphere of autonomous learning.</p>
<p>Generally, people believe that the current students' level has declined, and that students are not diligent, lazy, and indolent. This is a partial fact and cannot be denied. Because some commercial schools excessively loosen students' homework. However, some schools overcorrect, implementing crammed education, regardless of students' abilities and energy, and specializing in adopting deeper textbooks to praise themselves. I feel that the fact that students are mentally distracted and do not concentrate on learning is due to the lack of an atmosphere in the school that encourages them to work hard and study medicine, which is a very important reason. The formation of this reason is multifaceted. It is known that the temptation of material life outside, the difficulty of finding a suitable job after graduation, the frustrating environment, etc., are all factors. But we must not ignore the lack of action by the school authorities to encourage students to make continuous progress. This can be seen from the fact that the school authorities have canceled various academic competitions and stopped holding research conferences, discussion groups, and lecture halls. It cannot be denied that the desire to win is inherent in everyone. A student's academic entanglement is easily motivated by glory. If the school authorities can grasp the students' psychology and make good use of it, even the students who have always been diligent will become more diligent. Their spirit of learning will not be difficult to influence other students. Therefore, young people who are capable and self-loving can put effort into learning. They will not have extra time and energy to spend outside the school, indulging in singing and dancing. Rectifying the academic atmosphere may not be able to achieve some effect in this area.</p>

<p>Statement by Chief Secretary Wu Songfu</p>
<p>Wu Songfu, the chief secretary of the First District Public Office, declared when interviewed by reporters yesterday: "In order to solve the problems caused by the current reduction in the amount of household rice allocated, it is necessary not only for the Chinese and Japanese authorities to cooperate, but also for the public to sincerely understand and help each other, and jointly support the work of this allocation." According to Mr. Wu, after the takeover of the concessions, various inevitable problems have arisen one after another. With the cooperation of the new staff in various departments of the First District Public Office, the current situation is being improved. The differences in salaries between Chinese and foreign staff have been corrected. In the future, salaries will be determined based on talent, regardless of nationality. The most important task currently considered by officials of the First District Public Office is to ensure that the residents of this city have enough household rice for daily use each month. The authorities need to understand that whether or not the food problem is solved is deeply related to the economic situation of this city. Mr. Wu said that all levels of staff have devoted most of their time to solving the problem, and he believes that satisfactory and concrete solutions will be implemented soon. Mr. Wu said that the satisfactory solution of the rice problem is undoubtedly a great benefit to all people in Shanghai. At the same time, he revealed that since August 1st, all official documents and letters used by the First District Public Office have been changed to Chinese. Mr. Wu also said that the salaries of the staff used in the District Public Office, especially those with lower salaries, have been considered for an increase.</p>

<p>Banks and money shops, noting the significant decline in fixed deposits in recent years, especially savings deposits, have taken action. Savings in banks are immediately withdrawn upon maturity, and new bank savings are mostly close to zero. As a result, some banks no longer have savings departments, or they exist in name only. In order to protect the interests of depositors, the Ministry of Finance has ordered banks to pay deposit reserves and revised the Savings Bank Law. Ordinary banks engaged in savings business must have a minimum capital of 5 million yuan. The total capital of savings banks must be at least 6 million yuan. In addition to complying with these regulations, banks are also striving to promote the virtues of saving and guiding idle capital into the right track. They have increased interest rates on savings deposits, especially focusing on</p>
<p>Fixed deposits. It is heard that those with a one-year term have been raised to more than 8% annual interest, while long-term deposits of more than one year have been raised to more than 10%, and demand deposits have been raised to more than 5%. In addition, they are promoting thrift savings programs, designating a week starting on the 8th of each month as a thrift savings week. Each bank extends office hours by one hour to specifically accept thrift savings deposits, with interest rates higher than ordinary deposits. At the same time, they are particularly cautious in the use of funds, and operate entirely in accordance with government laws and regulations to encourage savings.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Sales of Miscellaneous Grains are Booming, Illegal Trading is Strictly Prohibited <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Since the household rice supply in this city has had some setbacks, the general public has been adding miscellaneous grains to their diet, resulting in a surge in the main routes of various miscellaneous grains, making them an essential food for residents. Each business has placed them separately at the entrance for consumers to choose at will. Due to the booming sales, holders of goods have raised prices, hoping to obtain greater profits. This point requires attention from the authorities, who should take measures to stop it in order to lighten the burden on the common people.</p>
<p>It was learned from miscellaneous grain industry sources yesterday that the supply of various miscellaneous grains is currently still booming, mostly coming from major towns along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Because local farmers plant both rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains as major products, the annual production is considerable. Currently, they are being transported here by water and land, with the number of arriving tons varying daily, but estimated to average around 50 tons, which is essential for the food of the people of this city.</p>
<p>As for miscellaneous grain reserves, they are still abundant. Although sales have increased, the supply is also smooth, and arrival and sales are balanced. According to old buyers who are familiar with the miscellaneous grain market, the recent reserves of miscellaneous grains include more bran, red sorghum, and peas, followed by corn and wheat, and generally less red soybeans. However, new corn has already entered the market, and farmers in various producing areas are organizing it for shipment to Shanghai in batches for sale. However, the Miscellaneous Grain Association strictly prohibits transactions in the market in order to eliminate illegal trading.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Shanghai Market Conditions Last Week <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The various bureaus in this city, in view of the frequent soaring prices, which not only increase the burden on citizens but also affect social security, have adopted drastic measures to thoroughly investigate and deal with the situation according to the law, taking all possible measures. Speculators and merchants are all threatened, and the evil practice of hoarding and speculation has gradually disappeared. Various goods have depreciated and are being sold at a loss. The market conditions for each sector last week are explored below:</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Unified Public Bonds Market Situation</p>
<p>The market situation is hovering, with numerous rumors causing unease. Holders of goods are eager to sell at the price, but few are inquiring. The market situation during the week has not been of much help.</p>
<p>Rice</p>
<p>The arrival of goods in the previous few days was</p>
<p>Prosperous, with 500 to 1,000 bags arriving daily by boat and car. However, sales have also increased sharply, resulting in a slight increase in market prices. On Thursday, due to continuous heavy rain, both arrival and sales decreased, resulting in a slight drop in market prices.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities</p>
<p>Due to rumors of a rationing system</p>
<p>To be implemented soon, people are uncertain, and buyers are hesitant. At the beginning of the week, matches were tired but firm, while soap was ignored, and candles were even more unpredictable. The entire market situation was still constant, until Thursday, when rain limited the arrival of goods and sales declined. Overall, the entire week was volatile.</p>
<p>Ornaments</p>
<p>The listed price is still 5,000 yuan</p>
<p>, plus a handling fee, but there are no goods on the market, and the industry is declining and depressed.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>The entire week was unusually scattered,</p>
<p>The owners of goods were quite embarrassed, and there was a slight turnaround on Friday. The entire day's trading gradually became lively. As for the market conditions of other industries, there were no drastic changes.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Firmly Establish the Belief in Certain Victory; Shatter the Propaganda Strategies of Britain and America; Understand the Foundation of the Greater East Asia War as Unbeatable <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Lieutenant Tanaka, Deputy Spokesman of the Japanese Naval Press Department, recently provided a thorough response to questions posed by this newspaper's reporter, strongly urging that people not be misled by the ideological and strategic warfare of the enemy countries, Britain and America. His analysis was extremely insightful, and his original words are as follows:</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "A plan must be secret, and its execution must be swift." Or, as another saying goes: "Like a virgin at rest, like a rabbit in flight." What is the true meaning behind these sayings? We will leave that for another discussion. In short, when undertaking a matter, a hesitant and looking-around attitude is not favored by great generals of the past. We are fundamentally different from our enemy countries, Britain and America. We are currently engaged in a fierce battle in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It goes without saying that the Greater East Asia War was initiated only after careful planning and a firm belief in victory. Only Japan fights with the confidence that it will win. Therefore, there is absolutely no need to worry about changes in the war situation or shifts in the international landscape. We simply need to move toward our intended goal, forcing Britain and America to beg for peace. The recent Quebec Conference held by Britain and America and their active promotion of strategic propaganda are shallow attempts to create joy and sorrow. This is not only an attitude we should not adopt, but such timidity will ultimately prevent the completion of the great task of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In other words, to achieve victory, leaders must remain calm, and the people must diligently and bravely work towards the goal. Even if Britain and America were to gather a large fleet to attack Tokyo, we only need to maintain the resolve of Hojo Tokimune: "Even against ten million enemies, I will persevere," and that will be enough.</p>
<p>We Should Deeply Understand the Unbeatable Situation</p>
<p>The national crisis we are currently facing in the Greater East Asia War is far beyond comparison in scale to any previous national crisis, but in terms of the danger of the crisis, it is lighter than in the past. Why do I say this? Because, quantitatively, the Japanese army and navy are capable of matching the British and American armies and navies. In terms of economic power, we are also capable of competing with Britain and America. Our ancestors, with ten percent of the power against the enemy's infinite power, were still able to overcome national crises and achieve victory. How much more so now, when we have ten percent of the power against ten percent of the enemy's power, is there any reason not to win? However, we must now clearly recognize that Japan has established an unbeatable position and hold the resolve to face the world alone.</p>
<p>By reading the Imperial Rescript declaring war on Britain and America, issued on December 8th of the year before last, it is clear that Japan, in order to eliminate all economic and military threats and seek stability in East Asia, and for the sake of self-preservation and self-defense, resolutely rose up, seeking to resolve the issues independently from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Of course, we already had a sure calculation of victory before we rose up. The battle taking place on the stage of the Pacific Ocean is unprecedented in scale, so naturally, we cannot be swayed by joy or sorrow over minor gains or losses. If you open and browse a world map, it is immediately clear that Japan has already firmly established an unbeatable position. Even if enemy planes attack, or we lose certain occupied territories, there is no need to worry. Moreover, during wartime, enemy planes attacking our occupied territories is a common occurrence in military affairs. In the six months since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the century-old influence of Britain and America in East Asia has been completely eliminated. Yet, are they not still boasting about reclaiming their lost territories? The number of enemy air raids we are currently suffering, compared to the damage suffered by Britain and America, is truly incomparable.</p>
<p>America is again boasting about confronting Japan with its production power, which is precisely a method that benefits our side. America's production power has been gradually decreasing since this year. Conversely, Japan's production power has been making rapid progress since this year. Therefore, the situation is exactly the opposite for us. Whether in terms of production warfare or long-term warfare, it is all advantageous to Japan. If America uses tactics to disrupt trade, this will also benefit Japan. Enemy submarines will only be destroyed by Japanese destroyers. The same is true for aircraft. Therefore, there are no unfavorable signs on the battle lines. Japan has already established an unshakeable position of certain victory in both economic and military strength. The driving force behind establishing this position of certain victory is naturally the vigorous and active actions of the Japanese Navy, such as the brave battles of the defense forces on Guadalcanal Island, and the fierce fighting of the defense forces on Attu Island and Kiska Island. The enemy is unaware of our country's efforts in the political and economic construction of Greater East Asia, and is being exploited by Japan's plans for induced operations. They have gathered a large force on Guadalcanal Island and Attu Island, resulting in immense damage. When they promote and brag to their citizens about retaking those places, has Japan not already established an unbeatable position?</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter how the American military counterattacks in the future, we are already in an invincible position. We must have a firm belief in victory. We must fully recognize this situation and not be exploited by the strategic warfare of Britain and America. There is no need to worry at all about the Casablanca Conference, the Quebec Conference, and the situation in Italy. Anyone who does worry has been exploited by the strategic warfare of Britain and America. Therefore, in ideological warfare, we must increasingly elevate our hatred for Britain and America. An American war correspondent once wrote an article discussing how Japan has established an unbeatable position. An excerpt from the original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"After achieving complete victory in the Pacific through large-scale offensives, Japan has become satisfied. The defensive posture in that area, both on land, sea, and air, has been further strengthened. The liberated natives, who have gained freedom, are cooperating with the Japanese army to build this defensive posture. Given time, Japan will build the world's largest nation and place the nations of Asia under its guidance.</p>
<p>The Chinese in Vietnam, the Thai, the Malays, and others are becoming aware that their fate is tied to Japan. For the sake of thorough defense, Japan is strengthening its air force. To counter the same attempts at Allied landings as in the Solomon Islands, the Japanese army is actively strengthening the defense of all strategic locations. According to a certain special correspondent's report, the defense of Corregidor Island in the Philippines is superior to Gibraltar. The current operations of the Japanese Navy are aimed at inflicting great damage when the American army comes to attack in the future, preventing the expansion of large-scale battles in the Pacific, and frustrating American morale.</p>
<p>That kind of American operation is exactly what Japan wants. At the time the American army began operations, the Japanese army had already taken everything into its hands. Even now, the American army is being blocked by the Japanese army's outpost line, and after a year of hard work, they have only retaken an airfield and a few jungle villages."</p>
<p>The above has stated how powerful Japan is, and that even the combined power of Britain and America will be required to defeat Japan. The enemy themselves have already admitted that Japan has an unbeatable position. It is urged that the citizens not underestimate the war against Japan.</p>
<p>Quebec Conference</p>
<p>Recently, Roosevelt and Churchill held the so-called Quebec Conference for the purpose of carrying out the war. After two weeks of discussions, it concluded on the 23rd. This conference was driven by each party wanting to expand their own interests, filled with ambition. The ugly spectacle of so-called "sharing the same bed but dreaming different dreams" and "enemies in the same boat" can be imagined. Roosevelt and Churchill have now held six conferences, whether it be on the Prince of Wales, in Casablanca, or in Quebec. However, none of the outcomes of these conferences have been realized. Therefore, these frequent conferences are not war-planning meetings, but propaganda tactics aimed at the world and the citizens of their own countries. If the outcome of a conference has been decided, there is no need to meet so many times.</p>
<p>Even if the outcome of the conference is to make Japan the "primary target of attack," we should not be surprised. Because we are at war with Britain and America, whether Britain and America pour all their strength into attacking our country or not, there is no need for us to change our attitude.</p>
<p>Britain and America are shouting, "Now we will switch to making Japan our primary enemy and defeat them!" But a year and a half ago, we were already shouting, "Force Britain and America to beg for peace, and hold a grand naval review in New York!"</p>
<p>The so-called Roosevelt-Churchill conferences and the so-called inflammatory propaganda are mostly a kind of propaganda strategy. Even the Chongqing spokesmen, who are imitating Su Qin and Zhang Yi, have expressed dissatisfaction. Recently, Soong Tzu-wen and Soong Mei-ling traveled thousands of miles to the United States and received national-level treatment. Roosevelt even firmly promised to supply planes and gasoline, so they returned to Chongqing in high spirits. However, later, not a single plane or a single gallon of gasoline was seen delivered.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the anti-Axis forces heavily promoted the content of the Quebec Conference in Canada on August 13, but then claimed that they were concealing the content "due to operational reasons" and engaging in various propaganda tactics. In ancient times, there was the saying "actions speak louder than words," and it was also said "it is easier said than done." If Britain and America were truly discussing operations, they would naturally keep it strictly confidential. But from the fact that they have widely publicized the content of the conference to the world, there is no need to attach importance to the Quebec Conference.</p>
<p>To prevent people from noticing the fact that the Soviet Union did not participate in the conference, they spread propaganda saying, "This conference is a conference for waging war against Japan." At the same time, they made the dying Chongqing regime ecstatic, and they also appeased the dissatisfaction of the Soviet Union, using a method of killing two birds with one stone to boost the morale of the exhausted British people and the internally conflicting American people.</p>
<p>On August 27, when Mrs. Roosevelt visited Australia, she said, "If it weren't for me personally, my husband would have come here with me and could have enjoyed the scenery with even more delight." She used the scenery of Australia as a pretext to make a statement, but in fact, she clearly had the same mission as Knox in May to resolve the internal conflicts in Australia.</p>
<p>Also, when Mountbatten was appointed commander of the Southeast Asia Allied Forces, British Naval Minister Knox stated at a press conference, "I know nothing about it. The Navy Department is not under his command either." This fully exposed the internal divisions within the American army and navy.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, our country started the war with the belief in certain victory. Therefore, no matter what strategies or tactics Britain and America take, our military and economic position of certain victory will not only not collapse, but will surpass Britain and America starting this year. What we should pay special attention to now is establishing a belief in certain victory in ideological warfare and elevating our hatred for Britain and America.</p>
<p>First of all, in terms of elevating hatred for the enemy, although people generally speak of shared hatred on the surface, the remnants of British and American influence still dominate their minds and cannot be shaken off. After the Quebec Conference, Roosevelt used "brotherly love" as a mantra in the Canadian Parliament, which was truly a strategic piece of propaganda that deeply won people's hearts. America, a specialist in bragging, monopolized the propaganda of humanitarianism. But the treatment of Japanese Americans and our treatment of Americans are as different as heaven and earth. If there are still people today who are exploited by the propaganda strategies of these inhumane and unjust Britain and America, then they have already failed in ideological terms. Therefore, in order to make our unbeatable position even more complete, we should elevate our hatred for the enemy and not blindly believe in the enemy's strategic and propaganda warfare. The recent Quebec Conference was ultimately a strategic and propaganda tactic of Britain and America. This kind of propaganda is truly difficult to defend against. This tendency is especially pronounced in Shanghai. Therefore, no matter how the enemy schemes, relying on Japan's economic and political power, we will continue to strengthen our path forward, deeply recognize that the Greater East Asia War has an unbeatable foundation, and move toward overcoming the national crisis of the Greater East Asia War.

<h3 id="e33">One Month of Interception Battles on Rendova Island - The Japanese Navy and Air Force Bravely Attack the Enemy <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(From Naval Press Team Member Takeda at a certain base in the South Pacific) The enemy, who boasted greatly that they would completely occupy the Solomon Islands in one week, has now been ashore on Rendova Island for over a month, without achieving any significant success. Our troops in front of the enemy are even more courageous in battle, displaying the wonders of three-dimensional warfare on land, sea, and air, and gradually improving their positions. This is the main reason why the enemy cannot advance a single step. However, the fighting situation of our naval aviation units at the front-line base in the Solomon Islands for this month is truly beyond words to describe its magnificence. The Sea Eagles always maintain an attitude of making the impossible possible when it comes to combat. The enemy, from Rendova Island, crossed Rubiana Island, intending to advance towards our Munda base; on the other hand, they also landed behind Munda, approaching Kolombangara on the opposite shore. The enemy is reinforcing and supplying these landing forces from the air and sea. In response to these landing forces, our air force and navy, in coordination with the land forces, are displaying their specialty of annihilating the enemy. The Sea Eagles, who have been engaged in a month of interception battles on Rendova Island, become more courageous and murderous as the enemy comes. Their illustrious achievements are being written page by page in the history of the Greater East Asia War. In the skies over the Solomon Islands, it is becoming more intense day by day, and the enemy is bombing almost continuously, day and night. At our front-line ○○ base in the Solomon Islands, the warriors of the fighter planes and bombers, surrounding their commanding officer, Father Eagle ○○, are happily discussing the aerial warfare of the month. In this place, from the caring heart that thinks of his beloved subordinates, he speaks of many modern aerial warfare postures. Just listening to them feels supremely magnificent. The skies over the Solomon Islands have now become a battlefield in the skies where the Japanese and Americans are fighting fiercely. Let's take a look at the actual situation from the mouths of the warriors.</p>
<p>Commander of the Air Force, striving to strike the enemy: The enemy, who has consolidated Guadalcanal Island and established a base in Tulagi, can be seen to be gradually advancing. At that time, they were frequently bombing various locations in Munda and Kolombangara with 50 or 100 aircraft. They were saying shamelessly that they would use the experience of capturing Attu Island to capture Munda. Thus, the enemy's main force was advancing. We could see their momentum very clearly. Regarding this point, our army and navy elite had already made preparations and were waiting. Our aviation units, regardless of any sacrifices, flew to Guadalcanal Island to scout the enemy's departure.</p>
<p>But the enemy immediately increased their reinforcements. While looking for opportunities to attack, they also frequently carried out night bombardments of our land positions with cruisers and destroyers. At the end of June, the weather continued to be exceptionally bad. On the 29th, the day before the landing, it rained all day long. Taking advantage of this opportunity, they controlled us by bombing and shelling our front-line bases, and at the same time, sent a large number of transport ships to Rendova at night. After receiving this news, our troops immediately dispatched all aircraft and began bombing the landing sites. But as we expected, the enemy had already deployed heavy artillery positions on Rendova Island. Since June 30th, we have been attacking with all our air force power countless times every day. Although the sacrifices have been very great, we must stop the enemy by doing everything we can to strike them. In reality, the enemy is using this kind of weather to send a large fleet of transport ships continuously. If we carry out attacks, there will definitely be some sacrifices. But regardless of these sacrifices, we attack the landing sites.</p>
<p>That week was extremely difficult. Those guys always had thirty or forty planes circling in the sky no matter when they went. If we attack them with fighter planes, enemy ships would swarm us. A certain Air Force Sergeant Major recounted the story of his first attack:</p>

<p>— Ren Shufang</p>
<p>She took my arm, and the fragrance of twilight wafted from her hair. We walked slowly on this European-style avenue of Jing'an Temple Road, my mind racing, my nerve cells telling me that today was Saturday.</p>
<p>Thinking that tonight was a day to be excited about, I looked at her purple eyelids shimmering under the streetlights, as if I were drinking wine: "Wanzi! Can you accompany me to the dance hall tonight?"</p>
<p>Her eyes lit up for a moment, then she smiled gracefully and slowly lowered her purple eyelids. Someone was blowing a horn on the street corner.</p>
<p>I forgot when, but I staggered home with an excited heart. I took off my shirt stained with dark red lipstick and felt a little dizzy.</p>
<p>The child was already asleep, and Ping was still leaning on the bed waiting. I didn't say a word, fell onto the bed, and went to sleep.</p>
<p>It was when the winter vacation started and I was a new professor at × University. I had just finished class and was about to leave the classroom.</p>
<p>"Mr. Ding, please come with me for a moment."</p>
<p>It was like a string of silver bells with a charming echo. I turned my head and truly it was God's masterpiece. She was wearing a woolen black qipao with a black coat, like a black peony in early spring, with big eyes like black jade.</p>
<p>I remember as I went down the stairs, my heart was about to escape from my throat.</p>
<p>The second time I taught, I saw her wearing a purple dress. Alas, she had transformed into a purple lilac.</p>
<p>For two months, watching her write a series of wrong characters on the blackboard, I followed her after class. I should have gone back to the faculty lounge, but instead, I followed her out of the school gate.</p>
<p>The dishes that Ping made for me, which I used to enjoy, became bland and tasteless. Even her plump little face was losing its color.</p>
<p>The matchmaker has passed. Her grades were terrible, but I didn't care and gave her an 80.</p>
<p>What a happy afternoon it should have been. When I was still in the laboratory, the tea boy brought a note:</p>
<p>"Mr. Ding: Could you please wait for me at the school gate when you finish your experiment! Wanzi."</p>
<p>I immediately felt my heart go crazy, my face flushed, and I looked at my watch. There was still half an hour before class ended. The footsteps of time crawled over my heart second by second, so slow, like enduring a long, cold night. That was so difficult.</p>
<p>Walking to the door, I saw a group of school boys talking and laughing loudly. Finally, she came. She was wearing a light blue robe, white leather shoes, and a blue ribbon fluttering in her hair. Smiling proudly, she walked towards me and said some casual words. Walking out of the school gate side by side, I immediately noticed that those young gentlemen were disappointed and made some beaten-down faces, staring at us blankly. I felt a burst of proud happiness.</p>
<p>The outskirts in April were filled with flourishing flowers. The wheat ears were already growing tall in the rice fields. The calls of cuckoos could be heard everywhere in the countryside. A branch of tender red roses from some villa hung down. Wanzi went up and picked one and pinned it on my lapel. I immediately felt as glorious as a sheep being loved by a lion.</p>
<p>Wanzi loved to talk. From her mouth, which was smeared with dark purple Kiss-proof lipstick, flowed sweet, soft words. She loved middle-aged men's mustaches, how solemn they were wearing dark-colored suits. Anyway, every word she said made my nerves jump with pleasure.</p>
<p>I remember before Ping and I got married, I quite liked Ping's speech, but now I found Ping's speech too gentle and uninteresting, not exciting enough. A man needs to live with a bold and stimulating woman.</p>
<p>For half a year, she took my arm and ran around everywhere. She never asked if I was married, nor did she ever talk about how we would develop our relationship. I gradually became uneasy.</p>
<p>"Wanzi, will you stop loving me!" I felt that I couldn't take it anymore.</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense, think about where to go to play tomorrow!" Disappointed and sad, I didn't say a word until we parted. Suddenly, she leaned close to my ear and said:</p>
<p>"I will always love you." Then she kissed me on the cheek and ran away like she was flying, leaving me standing there in stunned surprise. I went home with excited steps, thinking all the way, who says that middle-aged men are failures in love?</p>
<p>The roses withered and summer came. The students were all threatened by the big exams, and their faces showed unnatural expressions. While I was busy grading her homework, Wanzi told me her phone number and told me not to forget to call her during the summer vacation. Sweating and busy for a few days, grading exam papers, Ping prepared thirst-quenching drinks or cold drinks for me every day, afraid that I would get too hot. But I didn't pay attention to these things. My mind was only thinking of Wanzi: Wanzi:</p>
<p>The day after the exam papers were graded, I called Wanzi, but the answer was that there was no such person at all. I made six or seven calls in a row, and the answers were all the same. My heart began to contract, and I spent more than a month living like I was being fried in a pan.</p>
<p>I went to the dance hall every day, using music and alcohol to numb myself. Finally, I met Wanzi and a man wearing a wide bow tie once. When I was drunk, she was more beautiful than before, wearing diamond earrings and white stiletto heels. She saw me and still smiled as before, introducing me, saying:</p>
<p>"Mr. Ding, this is my fiancé. We are getting married in the fall. Please come to our wedding then!" I immediately heard the sound of all the cells in my body collapsing. I don't know when I left the dance hall and went home. I felt the whole earth was spinning!</p>
<p>Thinking of the shame and regret of the past, all came to my heart, and I couldn't help but sob on the sofa.</p>
<p>Ping stroked my hair and sighed:</p>
<p>"Don't think about the past anymore. You should always consider things before doing them in the future."</p>
<p>I looked up at her in surprise. She smiled, so gently.</p>
<p>"Do you think I don't know? Once I saw you walking with that beautiful lady at the company, but I quickly avoided you; I was afraid that meeting face to face would embarrass you." Ping's eyes were also red, and another wave of shame and hatred gripped me.</p>
<p>"Ping, can you forgive your dishonest husband?"</p>
<p>"Of course, dear." I couldn't help but throw myself into Ping's arms like a child and cry loudly.</p>

<p>— Shen Jie</p>
<p>Clack! Clack!... ! Da! Da!... The endless sound of machines, ringing and clamoring from early morning until late at night, without rhythm, without melody, a music that endlessly deprives "people" of their vitality, blurring the meaning of their existence in the world.</p>
<p>Day by day, consuming the spring of their lives, to live, to have the bare minimum of life, selling their health without any reservation: not wholesale, but retail. They are controlled by machines all day long, working like machines. For the sake of the comfortable silk stockings on the feet of gentlemen and ladies, something that fashionable and noble women would absolutely never think of, nor will they ever think of.</p>
<p>The yellowish complexion, having long been eroded of its vitality by hard work; a haggard appearance, soiled clothing, and even more pitifully, they are barefoot all year round, even though they produce so many socks every day. Their slow pace, always as slow as a snail, seems to fear its future. Who will extend a hand of sympathy and assistance to this remnant of life that is despised by others?</p>
<p>From youth to old age, one after another, being ruthlessly ravaged, until they breathe their last breath. The boss, who used to be tormented by work, but now takes revenge on these successors in a cyclical way, by scolding, cursing, and even hitting them fiercely at the slightest pause! But this group of people who are forgotten, do not resist, only sob and pour out the sadness in their hearts. The reason is that life and everything else are cruelly waiting for them, especially some very young girls. Logically, they should be living a happy school life, but their born misfortune has determined their life, as people have decided for them. There is no light of hope, and even a quick smile is reluctant to linger outside their dull and monotonous lives. The only pitiful hope is – please let me make half a dozen more today! Mother hasn't had white rice porridge in a long time.</p>
<p>Clack! Clack!... Da! Da!... Ringing, clamoring, a music without rhythm, without melody! Draining people's vitality, bringing beautiful silk stockings to the noble.</p>
<p>The human world! Is originally a web of conflicting life!</p>

<p>— Yu Si</p>
<p>I am a traveler and a mountaineer. I do not love the plains, and I seem unable to sit still for long.</p>
<p>Now, I have truly embarked on the great road. I must climb over myself, ever upward, until the stars are beneath my feet. Yes, looking down upon myself and my star, only thus can I say that I have reached my peak! Walking in the twilight. The road rises in the eroding soil, a lonely little path, malicious, without grass or trees.</p>
<p>My feet hoarsely tread on the stones that crunch mockingly, crushing the stones that make it slippery.</p>
<p>Although my limbs are weak and my spirit feels decadent, there is something within me called "courage," which is the greatest beast, so it overcomes all other beasts, overcomes the deepest pain of mankind.</p>
<p>Often, when I wander alone at night, on a confusing road, my whole will flies alone, and my soul is full of joy: time also runs on nimble feet, and I comfort my heart with ruthless maxims, walking, walking.</p>
<p>Look! Another sea is spread out before me, and I stand in silence for a moment. At this height, the night is cool, clear, and full of starlight.</p>

<p>Continued from the first page</p>
<p>The Enemy Was Startled</p>
<p>Air Force Sergeant, on June 29th, suddenly received information from the Rentba Island area, and immediately issued a mobilization order. I served as the squadron leader of the fighter planes and accompanied the other team... In the bad weather, weaving in and out in between... However, when we arrived at Rentba Island, the weather also improved. Several cargo-laden transport ships near 00 meters, advancing toward the island from the south, either visible or hidden, were being protected by destroyers. Because there was no sign of enemy aircraft in the nearby airspace, we immediately wanted to charge. When we lowered our altitude, my aircraft No. x began to tilt continuously. Perhaps enemy aircraft had appeared, so I turned around and looked, and more than twenty Sikorsky-type aircraft flew in from the right, and more than twenty Grumman-type aircraft charged from the front, so this resulted in a head-on collision. It was an air battle mixed together.</p>
<p>It seems the enemy was startled. We, who were initially at a disadvantage, immediately went from being evenly matched to gaining the upper hand. After that, the battle situation was controlled by us. The enemy deliberately made an attacking pose to escape. We shot down those who attacked and chased those who ran away. In less than twenty-five minutes, the sky was full of... planes. After forty minutes, there was no trace of the enemy planes. This was the result of the battle.</p>
<p>The machine-gun strafing... was a very long air battle. Although it was a difficult battle, it was indeed a joyful result to shoot down thirty-one enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Air Force Sergeant: On July 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, from sunrise to sunset, the enemy constantly flew forty to fifty aircraft into the sky above Rentba Island. On June 30th, the Sikorsky and Grumman types had suffered losses from us, so from the second onwards, twin-engine P38 and P39 types came. They carried a huge mission to capture and annihilate the enemy fighters. At an altitude of 00 meters, we suddenly penetrated the enemy's airspace. We engaged with the P38 types. Those guys were in teams of two or four. I chased a team of two aircraft, but they began to flee northwest from Rentba. There was a pile of turbulent clouds in front of them. I expected that they would fly into the turbulent clouds and turn around, so I waited for them. As expected, they came out. So I flew close desperately and strafed with machine guns, and the bullets went straight toward the enemy pilot's position and exploded. Then it swayed and fell down. On this day, many P38 type aircraft were shot down. At that time, I thought the enemy was afraid and would not come again. But the next day, a large team of P58 type aircraft came again, intending to challenge us.</p>
<p>Sweeping Ships Day and Night</p>
<p>Commander 00: At that time, the enemy landed on Rice Bay on the Monta side behind us, and the battle line expanded even further. The enemy did not care about the consumption and losses, and always had reinforcements. It was truly a war of effort in rescue. No matter how we eliminated them, their reinforcements always kept coming. So, we were sweeping enemy aircraft and acquiring sea vessels day and night. There was such a thing once.</p>
<p>When we received information that the enemy was landing east of our airfield, our aircraft team immediately departed. We were ordered to attack boats, and if there were no boats, to bomb land points. So we took off. Before long, we received a report saying that the enemy had been repelled in the waves. Because there were no boats, I was worried and wondering, were we going to bomb our own ground troops? But it would be wrong if we did not act according to orders. What should we do? Just as we were helpless, we received an order to return to our original defense, and then we felt relieved.</p>
<p>Lieutenant: How many times have you bombed the enemy?</p>
<p>Surprise Attack Completely Successful</p>
<p>Lieutenant: On the 21st, when we launched a surprise attack on Rentba Port, it was completely successful. Turning over from the south, we counted the enemy destroyers and steamships, one, two, three, but the people below could not detect us. After we were ready, we dove down. Only then did the enemy notice, and they began to shoot in a panic, but it was too late. They were completely our target. It could almost be said that they sank into the seabed without even needing to drop bombs. The destroyer wanted to escape quickly, but it was too late and was sunk. The large transport ship, full of cargo and people, was also directly hit and sank into the seabed. It can truly be said that this day's attack was completely successful.</p>
<p>Commander: Because it is a competition for supplies and reinforcements, a very impressive night battle has recently unfolded on the ocean. The aircraft protecting the fleet also launched an air battle. Lieutenant 00 also shot down a Grumman-type aircraft on the 13th!</p>
<p>Winning a Battle at Dawn Lieutenant: The enemy destroyers and cruisers were sunk in the way we wanted. It was on a night of night battles, near dawn, when we... victoriously completed the battle and were returning home, and we flew to the sky where the naval battle had taken place. In an instant, we saw two destroyers constantly circling a badly damaged warship. To see more clearly, we... lowered our altitude and began to circle. Then, the destroyer below suddenly fired an anti-aircraft gun at us with a "bang"! Ah! We then realized that it was the enemy. However, was this strange ship that was surrounded ours? Upon closer inspection, we realized that the enemy ship had been bombed in half, and only the part from the smokestack forward remained floating on the sea. The two... destroyers wanted to rescue it. The destroyers kept firing. There was really no way in this situation, and it was a pity that we did not have bombs. We had no choice but to fire several rows of machine guns, and then the enemy fighter plane, the Grumman type, came to the rescue. We suddenly switched to air combat and returned after shooting down eleven aircraft. Because... it was a strange ship type. At first, we really didn't understand, it turned out to be half a warship. We had never seen this before.</p>
<p>Let Fellow Aircraft Attack</p>
<p>Lieutenant 00: It was about a week ago. When we were attacking Rentba Island at night and were on our way home, it was very... the weather was very bad. When we came out of the tip... suddenly a black shadow of a ship appeared in front of us. There were several... It was definitely correct. I cherished the opportunity to ambush in my heart. Slowly descending from afar... Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be an enemy cruiser and... a destroyer. It was a pity... we discovered the enemy but had no bombs... Then let the fellow aircraft attack... In the vicinity... Drew a large circle... Slowly... increased the height... Suddenly descended from the clouds... Straffing with machine guns. Up until this point... The enemy fleet thought that we were their own. After the fellow aircraft dropped the bombs and dodged away... The greatly startled enemy... Although they saw that our plane had flown far away... They were still constantly firing... Anti-aircraft guns and heavy artillery... Unyielding and unremitting battle</p>
<p>Commander 00: In short... the enemy has many things... Therefore, in this unyielding and unremitting battle... we also need to unite more sincerely... we must have a firm... determination not to be defeated... The enemy attacked our 00 base continuously, day and night... Large aircraft and small aircraft, large formations of aircraft... used them without rules... If we are not careful even a little bit... we will be taken advantage of immediately... On a bright moonlit night, of course, they will definitely come... No matter how many they shoot down, they still keep flying over. They think that even if they are shot down by us, it is good. This accumulation will also have an effect... We must pay attention to this... These Type 24... (Original missing)... Type 2... B-17 type bombers... came flying under the direct cover of fighter planes, constantly dropping bombs. We were very unhappy about engaging with the enemy in the skies above our own area... Lieutenant 00: Because we didn't know the enemy was coming... So we wanted to... line up the team... Then... it felt a little strange inside the field... There were also people starting to run around... I was thinking that this was really strange! It turned out that the enemy had come to attack... So, we flew into the high sky. Found... Their own aircraft that had already flown from within the airfield... Cooperated to conduct air combat...</p>
<p>Commander 00: At that time, the enemy came with twenty-one large aircraft... and dozens of small aircraft. A large formation of aircraft like this had also come to attack a few days ago, and twenty-three aircraft were shot down. As soon as I issued an air raid warning, I went to the... platform... Everyone united sincerely. A certain commander: The morale of the soldiers and the revitalization of the military's spirit, this is the spirit of the Imperial soldiers, so there is no need to worry. I only hope that everyone will always pay attention to whether everyone is united sincerely. Such things are currently happening... The enemy's fastest aircraft, the P-38 type, came to scout at an unusually high altitude. At that time, there happened to be a newly appointed fighter pilot on patrol in the sky. Not knowing what to do, he only saw the enemy plane trying hard to approach him. There was no hope of escaping, but somehow he shot down the enemy plane. When he landed, all the aviators applauded and congratulated him. Because he was an aviator who was not very familiar with everyone, he was always worried in his heart. But seeing this situation, he became radiant.</p>
<p>When the dive bomber team, which suffered the most damage, departed, all the aviators waved their hats to welcome them. It was truly of one heart and one mind. Sincere unity... Gathering so many people... The most difficult thing is to constantly emphasize this point. If there is an opportunity, immediately come forward to explain. In short, never mind... Like this, everyone is harmonious and strong... There is nothing like this outside Japan. (Translated from Japanese)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Pan Sansheng Promotes Sports, Organizes the Sansheng Sports Association, Actively Develops Various Men's and Women's Sports <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Pan Sansheng, Director of the Local Exchange Bank, noting that local sports have been declining for various reasons recently, and that sports are a necessary condition for strengthening the nation, has organized the Sansheng Sports Association. He hopes to rally support, so that sports can flourish from now on. The association was officially established in early August this year, with Mr. Pan serving as the president, leading everything. In addition to the original small soccer team, new members were recruited to form a large soccer team, gathering soldiers from Xu... and... The association also organized a tennis team, women's basketball and volleyball teams, and a track and field team. The Sheng... team, a strong four-person soccer team, also came to join the association, changing its name to the Overseas Chinese Vocational Team. The establishment of the association coincided with the National Government's recovery of the Shanghai Concession, when the whole country was celebrating fervently. Therefore, the association organized a football tournament to celebrate the recovery of the concession. Two matches were held at Yihai successively. In the first match, Sansheng won against the Four-Team Alliance, and in the second match, they lost to the Shanghai Navy. At that time, the traffic on Avenue Albert was heavy, and the scene was unprecedentedly grand. The income from the... reached 600,000 yuan, which was distributed to Shen Xin Er Bao as a scholarship to benefit poor students, which was very significant. The expansion of the association is described below.</p>
<p>Football Team Forms Iron Army</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the Sansheng Sports Association, there was already a small soccer team. All the members were young warriors with abundant strength, and they had repeatedly defeated strong teams, gaining a lot of recognition. With the establishment of the Sports Association, all the warriors of Xu... were recruited to form a large soccer team, with Wang Xisheng, Yu Liming, and the Li Hua brothers joining. President Pan aims to discover new talents, regardless of winning or losing, which is deeply in line with the true meaning of promoting sports. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Large Soccer Team</p>
<p>Yu Lihua, Luo... Fu Gao, Zhang Yuanzhi, Mai... Sen, Xu Deming, Zhi Yang, Lian Jun, Wang Xisheng, Zhou Defa, Wen Zhuang, Wen Quan, Zhou Wenkui, Gu Yiyi, Wang Guoguang, Yu Liming</p>
<p>Small Soccer Team</p>

<p>Chen Houde as Goalkeeper</p>
<p>Tennis Team Wins Twice in Two Battles</p>
<p>Subsequently, a tennis team was established, attracting tennis players such as Li Guofan, Tang Baojia, Yu Tianguang, Liang Deguang, Wang Shuqing, Guo Yujie, Liu Chongben, etc. Veteran Zhang Dingjian also donned his uniform again and played for the team. Mao... from the Shanghai-Hong Kong... also obtained amateur qualifications, changed his name to Tao Guanqiu, and served the team, adding more splendor. They had friendly matches with the Central and Lianming teams twice, defeating their opponents by 7 to 4 and 7 to 2 respectively, gaining fame and reputation. It can be said that they had the appearance of dominating the Chinese tennis scene in Shanghai. In order to promote tennis, the association also initiated and hosted the Shanghai Open Tennis Championship, which has already begun registration and will be unveiled soon. The full list of team members is as follows:</p>
<p>Tao Guanqiu, Zhang Dingzhao, Li Guofan, Tang Baojia, Liang Deguang, Yu Tianguang, Liu Chongben, Guo Yujie, Wang Shuqing, Lu Zengkui, Zhu Min... Yu Zhizhong, Wang Ziyang, Wang Yiwu, Wang Jun, Zhang Zhengshu, Huang Ruigong, Li Daozhi, Li Tiansheng,... Chunhua, Yu Liming, Yu Lihua, Zhu Shangwei, Xu Yugong, Li Huiguan.</p>
<p>Track and Field Team Neatly Arranged</p>
<p>The Sansheng Track and Field Team was recently formed. President Pan, noting that track and field in this city lacks leadership and has been declining, has actively planned venues and searched for famous track and field athletes to form this team. He specially invited Qian Xucang, a senior figure in the sports world, to serve as the instructor, and publicly elected... Zhong as the captain to engage in training. In the near future, they will arrange a competition with track and field teams from friendly nations in the city to learn from each other. The team has Wang Xuewu, Guan Hongda, Yu Liming, Wang Jinghu, Luo Da, Guo Tingyao, Wu... Nian,... Jinhai, Zhu Shafei, etc., and the lineup can be said to be neat. In the future, they will also focus on training new talents to create rising stars and establish a good foundation for Chinese track and field. The team list is as follows: (Instructor) Qian Xucang, (Manager) Guan Hongda, Wang Xuewu, (Officer) Li Sicong, Dai Yanwan, (Clerk) Wu Hongbai, (Captain) Li Zhenzhong, (Members) Guan Hongda, Wang Xuewu, Yu Liming, Luo Da, Guo Tingyao, Zhu Shafei, Wu Huanian, Liao Jinhai, Wu Hongbai, Qian Zhenxing, Dai... Wan, Jin Jiayan, Wang Jinghu, Li Sicong, Yang Cunren, Yu Lihua, Wang Zhiyi, Zhu Jiakun, Xu Jian, Luo Lie.</p>
<p>Women's Basketball and Volleyball Teams Formed One After Another</p>
<p>In terms of women's sports, basketball and volleyball teams have been formed. The basketball team is based on Bai E, and will participate in the opening guest of the Health Cup, defeating Huada by... to 20, which is amazing. In addition to basketball team members Shi... Juan, Li Bo, Wang Gezhi, Zhao... Qing, Lu Cuifang, Wang Shijuan, and Hu Meixian... The volleyball team also has volleyball player Zhu Shifang and others participating. The team was just established and has not yet played, but its strength is expected to be extremely abundant, and it will surely show its edge in the future and dominate Shanghai.

<h3 id="e41">Shanghai Swimming This Summer Achieves Considerable Results <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Wen Jingling Achieves Excellent 800-Yard Time in Yesterday's Shanghai Open Swimming Competition</p>
<p>The hot summer is almost over. The situation for Shanghai swimming this summer differs slightly from previous years due to various reasons, with fewer swimming pools open. According to investigations, only the following locations are open to the public: Zhang Yuan Swimming Pool, Hongkou Swimming Pool, Sichuan Road YMCA, West China YMCA, and French Chamber of Commerce, among others. Compared to the flourishing state of previous years, it feels slightly inferior.</p>
<p>Overview of Various Swimming Pools</p>
<p>Both Zhang Yuan and Hongkou Swimming Pools have good locations. However, Zhang Yuan's fees are high, and the Hongkou Swimming Pool is far away on Jiangwan Road, making transportation inconvenient. Not many people go swimming there. The Sichuan Road YMCA swimming pool adopts a group swimming approach with lower fees. This season, more than 1,600 people participated, but it's not a place where you can just casually go and play. The West China YMCA swimming pool is only open to members of the Baojia Youth Group and the association this year. As for the French Chamber of Commerce swimming pool, it is entirely for foreigners.</p>
<p>Results Are Still Quite Good</p>
<p>Speaking of swimming talent and achievements, the lack of swimming pools has certainly had a significant impact. However, in yesterday's Shanghai Open Chinese Swimming Competition, considerable talent and achievements were still maintained, which is very gratifying. People like Wen Jingling, Wang Zhongcheng, Bai William, Xu Shouqiang, Diao Guohua, Chen Jingzhong, and Lu Huijie all achieved excellent results. In women's swimming, although the number of participants is small, people like Fang Tianji, Cheng Jinqian, and Shen Runming are outstanding women who received enthusiastic applause in every competition.</p>
<p>Swimming is one of the best exercises for strengthening the body and one of the most fun activities in the summer. Unfortunately, due to the high cost of swimsuits and tickets, it has become a luxury. It is hoped that next summer, it can be universally promoted, and more swimming pools can be built so that more people can enjoy the fun of water sports.</p>
<p>Scene from Yesterday's Competition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sports Association and the Chinese YMCA jointly organized the Shanghai Open Swimming Competition yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM at the Sichuan Road YMCA. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. The results represent the achievements of Chinese swimming in Shanghai this year. Although the results of each event are not as good as those of previous years, Wen Jingling's 800-yard freestyle can be considered a good achievement. Furthermore, the freestyle sprint champion was originally Wen Jingling, but Wen gave up the 60-yard freestyle to participate in the 400- and 800-yard events, which he had never tried before. As a result, he surprisingly won first place in all events and won the individual championship, which is truly admirable. At the same time, veteran backstroker Wang Zhongcheng was able to continue to maintain his top position in the 60- and 100-yard backstroke, surpassing Xu Shouqiang, which is a pretty good result. Up-and-coming young swimmer Bai William is predicted to be able to surpass others in Shanghai in the freestyle sprint next year. Other veteran players are indeed showing that the younger generation is to be feared. As for the women's side, many did not participate, and others withdrew at the last minute, so the results were naturally not good. Shen Runming continued to swim in four events. Although the results were not like Wen Jingling's in the men's and women's events, where he won first place in all of them, her spirit is truly admirable! (Liu Hesheng)</p>

<h3 id="e42">The City's Watched Football Three Giants Donghua Friendship Three Provinces Each Have Their Own Strengths <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Football is the most eye-catching game in ball sports because it can attract a large audience. Especially this summer's football has become white-hot. Today there is a charity game, tomorrow a championship match, and the players are too busy. The players' skills have improved rapidly. Although playing football in the summer seems out of season, the emergence of football talent can also be celebrated for the future.</p>
<p>As the football season approaches, all teams in Shanghai are making major preparations. They are hiring generals, recruiting troops, and piecing things together. In addition to Donghua Friendship, the Chinese teams also have the emerging Three Provinces team. The three teams have become the top three.</p>
<p>Donghua</p>
<p>The style is purely Shanghai-style, and the talent is currently somewhat declining. The basic team members are only Zhang Banglun, Zhuang Jiren, Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Zhang Zhaocheng, Xu Wenkui, Wang Xisheng, Han Longhai, and eight others. Recently, it was heard that Sun Jinshun and Zhang Lingen may join. Wu Binghao will return to his old ways and serve his mother team. If this can become a reality, Donghua can restore its heyday. Goalkeeper Zhang Banglun has recently been working hard, with the potential to overwhelm Lianyi's Liu Xianhan. The two defenders, Zhuang Youren and Zhang Lingen, are steady and bold, respectively, and are well-matched. Central defender Han Longhai sits in the center, giving the feeling of being invincible, both a general and a minister, assisted by Zhang Zhaocheng and Wang Xisheng. The five forwards: Ah Jin as the main striker, Zhao Cheng charging, Xu Nianren as the right winger. Although this public player has a wide range of ball skills, his physical strength is not as good as others. Lao Sun is skilled in stationed defense, becoming better with age. The two wings, Jia Youliang and Wu Binghao, are the best right wings in Shanghai, whether it is a direct pass or a cross, it is just right. Wu Binghao has been away from Shanghai for many years and has been out of the football scene for several years. This time, his comeback will be extraordinary. Looking at the entire Donghua team, there is no flaw to attack. The formation is so neat that it can be called the best in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Lianyi</p>
<p>Lianyi was the most outstanding team in Shanghai last year, and the four heroes in the team won a lot of glory for the Chinese. Most of the team members are veterans. This season, due to personnel changes, there is a tendency to collapse, such as Zhuo Shijin's returning home and not returning, and Zhang Lingen and Sun Jinshun's departure. Although there are replacements, the strength is ultimately greatly reduced. Currently, the team has generals Liu Xianhan, Li Tiansheng, Song Jin, Sheng Wu Qixiang, Li Yichen, Gao Baozheng, Zhai Chunhua, Meng Yiliang, Zheng Qiquan, Cai Shengmiao, and Qu Yongfu. As for the vacancies left by Sun, Zhang, and Zhuo, Wu Qixiang will replace Zhuo Shijin, Meng Yiliang will temporarily replace Zhang Lingen, and Zheng Yingquan will replace Sun Jinshun's left wing, which should be able to maintain the situation.</p>
<p>Three Provinces</p>
<p>The Three Provinces team is an emerging force with Xuhui as the foundation. The team is full of rising stars and is not short of experienced players. Zhou Defa's fierce battle, Gao Zhiwen's agile skills, Zhai Yuanzhi's agile interception, and Zhong Ziqian's accurate shooting are all outstanding. The team's goal is to be happy, not to win the championship. It is heard that the team's organizer will go to Hong Kong and Macau to hire talents.</p>
<p>Other teams such as Hezhong, Anhua, Overseas Chinese, and Yousheng are also preparing in secret. (Personnel)</p>
<h3 id="e43">Simple Fitness Training Method (I) <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Tom — Translated by De</p>
<p>I. How to Stand Straight</p>
<p>The first principle of fitness is to have the correct posture, and the second is how to maintain that posture. This is not only for aesthetic reasons, but also closely related to health, hence its importance.</p>
<p>To achieve this posture, stand against a wall. First, touch the wall with your heels, then try to have as much of the rest of your body against the wall as possible. Your head should also be back and resting on the wall. Your chin should be slightly tucked in. When you adopt this posture, you can see that your chest is expanded and your muscles are strong, which allows you to maintain the position of your chest without it expanding and contracting with your breathing.</p>
<p>The above is just one way to achieve the goal, and it is the first step towards correct posture. Move your entire posture forward while keeping your feet still. Except for the ankle joint, all other joints should also be kept still. From this, you can see that the correct posture is an automatic (firm) chest, a tucked-in abdomen, and the center of gravity of the body away from the heels, with the whole body upright.</p>
<p>People who tend to be obese will inevitably shift their body backward, with their chest sinking and their abdomen protruding, which is the opposite of correct posture.</p>
<p>II. How to Walk</p>
<p>When walking, the body should be stable, with the legs doing the work. The chest leads forward (do not let the abdomen go forward), and the toes and heels should touch the ground at the same time.</p>
<p>After the body is stable, take a few steps. The initial impulse seems to come from the thigh. At this time, you will feel that your steps are light, which you have never experienced before. Before long, it can become second nature, and you will feel uncomfortable if you don't maintain this correct posture.</p>
<p>III. How to Sit</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for people not to know how to sit. However, even those who know how to sit do not know how to sit in a way that is beneficial to their health. If readers doubt my words, please observe how children in schools, clerks in front of writing desks, and anyone eat. Generally, they sit too close to the table, causing them to lean forward, bending and twisting their vital internal organs, such as the heart, stomach, and liver, into one place. Indigestion, sluggish liver function, irregular heart action, and headaches are all inevitable consequences.</p>
<p>Therefore, when sitting in a chair, the body should be as far back as possible, but do not lean against the back of the chair. The spine should be straight, as in the correct standing posture. This allows the base of the spine to be supported, and the body can move freely while sitting, just as the ankle joint can move freely while standing. The chair should also not be too close to the desk or dining table.</p>
<p>IV. How to Rest</p>
<p>How few people in the world know how to rest properly. Sitting still is not the same as resting. To rest completely, the muscles must be relaxed, the body and mind must be relaxed, and the head, hands, and feet must all be at rest. If you lean back in a chair and feel comfortable and satisfied, you may as well lean back and discard all depressing thoughts, driving them away to nowhere.</p>
<p>When writing in books, if you feel mentally tired and your brain is gradually losing its ability to function and understand, the best way is to do some exercise, such as slowly lifting your heels off the ground and touching the ground with your toes, about forty or fifty times. This method can draw blood, although slightly, to supply the muscles and form the result of increasing brain activity without adverse effects.</p>
<p>The best time for the body and mind, especially the brain nerves, to rest is after noon. This is a rest that everyone should have.</p>
<p>V. Casual Sleep</p>
<p>This is the Spanish style of sleeping. In Spain and Mexico, the climate is hot and the days are long, so it is necessary to take a nap. However, in northern countries, an afternoon nap is also essential. The difference is that Spaniards sleep for two or three hours, while we can fall asleep in about two minutes through a kind of self-hypnosis.</p>
<p>VI. Self-Hypnosis</p>
<p>Do not lie down after a full meal to avoid crowding the digestive organs. Sit in an armchair with your head resting on the back, or in any kind of chair, as long as it is high enough to rest your head on it. The chair should be slightly reclined, and your feet should be placed on a chair of the same height, or slightly higher than the chair you are sitting in. Cross your feet at the ankles, clasp your hands together, interlock your fingers, and bring the muscles at the ends of your thumbs together. Close your eyes and concentrate, taking deep breaths. At this time, apart from silently counting slow and measured breaths, eliminate all distracting thoughts, and you can fall asleep within two minutes. The first experiment may not be effective, but after several practices, you can do as you please. Before going to sleep, remind yourself to wake up within fifteen minutes, and you will be almost accurate.</p>
