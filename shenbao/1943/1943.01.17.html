<h3 id="c1">政黨與政治　敬獻言於國民黨 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>於現實政治，我們人民必須加以注視的，尤其是負言責的與論界，在戰時更不應沉默而放棄我們的天職。</p>
<p>國民黨五中全會，已經在南京圓滿閉慕了。然而國民黨對於目前時代和今後中華民國的資任，却只有加重；對於全國人民的關係，也會更加密切，所以，人民固然不能漠然視之。而國民黨領袖和國民黨人，允常知所虛心聽納各方面的意見。我們站在人民立塲，站在愛護國民黨的立塲，敬願獻陳下列數點：</p>
<p>首先，我們認爲國民黨今後施政有一個很好的目標：就是重慶政權所言所行而已經失敗的，決不再蹈覆轍。凡重慶政權對於國家和人民的利益所解決不了的，要解決給全國人民看。那麽，一方面可以不走上重慶政權所碰壁之路，另一方面也就可以樹立國民黨在人民中的堅强的信仰。譬如說吧，重慶政權的失敗在那裏呢？凡是關心中國政治的都知道，是失敗在黨給少數人操縱，特別是給蔣及其戚屬所操縱，使黨失去了他本來的面目。尤其是黨的所謂最高領袖缺乏大政治家必要的光風　月的風度，日夜憂懼人民的努力擴大，日夜硏究如何箝制輿論，而不從黨的內部的整頓與健全着手。致使政府與黨的威信，一天天的墮落。其决，是黨內派別紛歧，互相爭權奪利；而各級黨員，又只知依仗黨勢，發國難財，假名抗戰，以　自私自利，把國家的利害，民生的困難，完全　諸腦後，於是黨便成爲人民怨恨的中心。所以日言「一个黨，一個主義，一個領袖」，而這個黨，這個主義，這個領袖，却一天天的沒落了。重慶政權與重慶國民黨這樣崩潰沒落的覆轍，實在是最好的鏡子。同時，重慶政權對於國家與人民的利益所解決不了的問題，主要的是糧食問題，物價問題，貪汚問題，一切有關改善人民生活的問題，我們希望南京國民政府都要有力量有辦法去謀澈底的解決，這樣，就在積極方面可以一新人民的耳目，過去冷眼旁觀的自然會贊助與擁護了，那時政府與黨的權威不言「提」而自「高」，那時雖不說「一個黨一個主義一個領袖」，而全國人民自然會衷心承認中國只有這「一個黨，一個主義，一個領袖」了！</p>
<p>其次，一個政黨與一個政治的關係之密切，是盡人皆知的事實。一價國家有了好的政黨，這個國家就會興盛發展，同樣的，如果一個國家有一個不良的政黨，那就會使國家民挨受累無窮。然而，政黨對於一國的政治的地位儘管重要，有一點却非常明白，就是必定有了國家的存在，然後才有政黨的地位，也就是說只有國家强盛，黨的勢力才能强盛；相反，如果國家貧弱不能獨立的時候，而徒知一黨的發展，如今日重慶國民黨」之所爲，那就徒然加速國家民族的危亡，終於自掘墳墓罷了。所以，現代一切爲人民所擁護的政黨，一定是「先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂」的政黨，一定是以國家和人民的利益爲第一位，而不以自己一黨之利益爲第一位的政黨。而現代一切黨碁鞏固黨勢强盛的政黨，也必定就是最能够爲國家之利益爲人民之利益而犧牲奮鬥的政黨。我們因此希望南京眞正爲國爲民的純正國民黨，少喊幾句已給重慶「國民黨」所喊壞了的爛口號，多做出些可以獲得全國人民稱道擁護的事業出來，多做出一些對國家對民族對廣大的人民有實際利益的事業出來，那時就眞正提高了黨的權威，黨的信譽。</p>
<p>我們的說話也許太率直些，然而我們對國民黨諸君子的誠意，作正在這些率直的句語中，我們竭誠希望諸君子有以一新全民的耳目，有以副我國家民族和偉大的新時代的期望！</p>

<p>— 家源</p>
<p>—一月五日澳六轉來—</p>
<p>（編者按本文前三節，載一月十一，十二，十三日本報自由談。）</p>
<p>訪敖干先生</p>
<p>噶而　一住數日，由於入藏問題仍無法解決，乃於是晚往訪同車之程君，程氏原就任於「參謀本部邊務處」，素極熱心，記者因係初見，未敢遽爾露出眞意，至此祇有實　，承共美意轉介紹與敖干先生。</p>
<p>敖氏　任西藏地方官，因不滿西藏政府之頑固保守，於民國廿四年僧同其子聯合所部及西康武力向西藏政府攻擊，後因西康方面未能接濟，不幸事敗，即走往南京，供職於蒙藏委員會，於廿五年來噶居住，西藏政府曾屢决請其回藏復職，但均予拒絕。爲人好學不倦，英語甚爲流利，平時對中國人素具好感，過去劉曼卿女士及其　入藏人物均賴敖氏之力，故肥者前往拜訪時，敖氏亦甚歡迎。</p>
<p>敖氏卜居於噶倫堡入口處之路側，一精美之建築，見面時彼甚關必於國家建設，記者均一一奉答。</p>
<p>以後談到中藏關係，他表示對三民主義之民族主義，非常讚同。並對記者談稱同。「西藏人民只知拜誦經典，對於世界上任何主義，均不明爲何物，故特將　民主義譯成藏文呈奉蒙藏委員會審核，惜因聯絡間斷，寄運不便，甚感爲難，現正設法，請駐加總領事代轉。」。</p>
<p>最後談到我的入藏，他一口承認負責，並且告訴記者，與其隨同藏商入境，不如自己雇用專人送去，較爲妥當。且麗人亦隨時可以辦到，比較等候藏商要快。因此乃決定託其僱人專送，必要的服裝，亦請代辦。惟因警署亦須登記，乃議定前往大吉嶺一行，回時另行　屆一較靜之處，候時出發，即不致再受阻碍。</p>
<p>大吉嶺之行</p>
<p>諸事既經就緒，乃於二十六日午後駕至警局登記，離開噶倫堡，復趨西里古里，是日因風雨所阻，到達西里古里巳是薄暮時分，其是正植南下火車開行之際，大吉嶺及幾里古拉開來之車，均於此時交接，因此車站正形擁擠，直至南下火車開出，車站始漸淸靜，由於西里古里地區不大，尙無旅館設備，往大吉嶺火車需待次晨八時，乃於侯車室中過夜。</p>
<p>從西里古里往大吉嶺令程約七十英哩，二等車票售價七個半羅比，火車之型形極小，較普通之輕軌　路猶小一籌。開行時兩列車同時開出，每一車頭僅能掛車廂三節，所載乘客不及百人，記者所坐之車廂祇有乘客四人，其中三人爲英國軍官，一路車行速率甚慢，故有自備汽車者咸乘汽車直達　。</p>
<p>出站後，漸次登高，沿山盤旋，每抵一站，車頭機件均得檢查一次，尤其刹車機件，更須將螺絲加緊，以防溜車之病。行至半山時，因山勢過高，乘客均須下車步行，車頭經一極長時間之檢查，始能直上，一路凡經絞嶺之處，火車又得前後　退，遂漸上升，速率之慢，汽車相較甚遠。人在車中　急異常，惟風景秀　，林蔭遮日，白雲朶朶上　，至高峯時遙望無際之太空，則使人又覺已登天界。既至山頂，較大之村鎮甚多，前後計六小時有半，始到達大吉嶺市。</p>
<p>走出車站，中有一條柏油大道，山上山下層决相接，多精美之建築，蓋此處原為避暑之勝地，高達七千英尺，氣候極佳，故歐西人士，均置有別墅，大街以下，爲印人及其他種族之市塲及居住區，山上亦置有高架鐵索，來回旋轉，運送貨物。</p>
<p>沿大道而行百公尺，力人繁盛之市區，兩旁各式商店林立，較之噶　堡市區之小，相差多多，且道上遊人極多，馬蹄得得，往來不息，此間亦有東洋車可乘，但形式略異，每車須用兩人拉動，記者就寓於路側之中央飯店，每日房價十餘盾，（包括食宿，合國幣百餘元）　而　高之房價，有數十盾者，大都爲闊綽之客，故其設備均極考究，藉以滿足遊咨之要求也。</p>

<p>內地，公務員和敎師的生活待遇，　加改善的呼聲，不絕如縷。下面又是一個敎師，對於米貼問題，發出不平嗚。他說：在　我們所感到　幾點如下。</p>
<p>（一）現在已是十月底了，而平價米津貼才發到六月份的，七月份的准借一部份。米價時在漲，以七月份的米津來買十一月的米，其中差異，非可言喻。（七月時棉花十八元一斤，現在是四十四元一斤）。本來是用以濟急的米貼，却延遲數月不發，是何綠故？是政府辦法如此？抑學校當局不負責</p>
<p>（二）敎師生活的淸苦，已是無可否認、然而我們十月份的薪水却硬被扣了百分之十改發儲蓄券（錢扣了，儲蓄券却不發下）、儲蓄當然是於國家於個人均有利的，但衣食尙不　溫飽時，還能作十年計劃儲蓄嗎？想政府也不需要在微薄的收入裏去吸收游資吧？</p>
<p>（三）又聞十一月份薪水，已決定扣出一百分之十爲擴大滑翔運動購機之用，滑翔運動本人萬分贊同，但運動固必需開展，而人們的生活維持也不能不替人設想設想。改善生活的辦法，到現在還未見實行的影兒，而尅扣薪水的事，則已層疊而來！若干萬萬公債又不公平地扣我們的薪水。我們已衣無可節，食無可縮，我們希望能公平地把人民應負的責任合理地分配，不要專在我們這些苦人身上打注意才好！</p>

<p>申報何人，本服務社會之指，努力從事，凡所舉措，一秉至公。命題甄別，悉託之專家，最後核定，取決於會議，工作諸君，僅辛勤於事務之處理，馴至因公費用，均各解自私囊，此種精神，歷久不懈。故每屆助學將次結束之際，鉅額助金，支配殆盡，而下屆辦理之初，一經揭布，社會熱心人士，必又自動捐輸，未及匝月，輙成鉅數，蓋聲氣相求，響應熱烈，社會之偉大同情心，每有不期然而至者，興念及此，尤深感動矣。</p>
<p>竊以社會救濟事業，亦至繁賾，然其意義之深遠，成就之偉大，則以助學爲最，蓋貧寒施捨，僅能救急於一時，而助學輸財，允爲積極性之義舉，使失學者入學，使入學者成材，十年廿年而後，養成無數健全份子，努力生產，造福社會，靑年爲國家柱石，允宜植其丕基，收效之宏，作用之溥，不尤愈於一時之施捨乎？抑尤有進者，樂善好施，爲國人傳統之優良習慣，社會偶有善舉，莫不慷慨解囊，悉力以赴，然於發動善念之頃，似宜慎爲抉擇，孰者救急於此日，孰者宏效於未來，輕重權衡，知所取舍，助學輸金殆爲應予倡導之善舉乎！</p>

<p>「施學」二字，讀者或者要覺得不是十分順口，因爲這是筆者所新創的。我所以要創這個名詞的原因，就是爲了施衣，施粥，施藥，施材，等名詞已經很普遍了。社會上對於凡有「施」字的工作，都認爲是一種善舉，都肯存爲善最樂的思想，很慷慨的，五百一千的掏出來。因此我想，如果助學金也能叨光，像軋米一樣，軋在「施」字的隊伍裏，讓大家認爲是善舉的一種，或者也能格外容易募集起來。</p>
<p>原來兒童和靑年的失學，就是成人無能無力的預的；換言之，也就足增加社會上無衣無食的候補者。所以如果社會上認爲施衣施粥等是一種善舉那我以爲對於淸寒學生的「施學，」是善舉中的更善舉了！因爲一個人等到要施衣施粥　，已經是太晚了；所以施衣施粥等，只是一種消極的善舉。如果我們能够對於淸寒學生，「施學，」使他們目前不致失學，將來能成爲社會上有用的人才，那不但可以减少這一代的施衣施粥等候補者於無形，而且還可以利上生利，將來再由他們出去「施學」，减少下一代的施衣施粥等候補者於無形。這樣一代一代的下去，使社會一代進步一代，那就是一種積極的善舉了。</p>
<p>因此，我深希望社會上的大善士們，除了樂於施衣施粥等消極的善舉外，更能多做積極的善舉—就是施學！</p>

<p>— 趙宗預</p>
<p>上海一埠，因爲生活程度的繼漲增高，靑年失學問題，益形跋重，一方面因生活關係，學費數目，下學期大於上學期，到目前爲止，一個小學生每學期所需的費用，可以抵八一三以前一個大學生所費而有餘，一個中學生每學期所需的費用，可以抵八一三以前一個留學生而有餘，同時每個學生的家長，他的家庭生活費，一年可以抵十年而有餘，在這種情况之下，青年失學的人數，那得不激增！</p>
<p>不過一般工商界，八一三以來，因爲物價不住的上翔，獲利十分優厚，從前十幾萬元的資本，現在變爲幾百萬元的，指不勝屈，所苦的，是一般薪水階級，眞是饔飧不繼，朝不謀夕，誰不愛其子女，誰不希望其子女成材？可是心餘力絀徒喚奈何。因此我萬分誠懇的請求工商界資本主，各自提出若干現金，捐充本報助學金，取之於社會者千，還之於社會者一，原是輕而易舉，但是社會已受惠不淺。工商界資本主，只要一動其胞與爲懷的念頭，本報的助學金，不難在極短時期內，集成一個偉大的數目，靑年失學的問題，可以完全解決，「人之欲善，誰不如我，」我相信今年未報助學金的捐款，一定比以前突飛猛晉呢！。</p>

<p>— 陳靑士</p>
<p>社會上最可歎惜的事，莫過於有才智有志氣的靑年學子，因經濟的限制，而失却求學的機會。這不但是個人的不幸，實在是社會無可補償的損失。本來，享受敎育的機會，乃人民應得的權利；供給敎育的機會，乃國家對人民應盡的義務。我國敎育，向未普及，而中學大學敎育，更非中產以下的家庭子弟所能希冀。其間不知埋沒了多少有才智有作爲的靑年，想起來眞可浩嘆。在人民的立塲，一方面固然應該督促政府，增加敎育經費，擴充敎育事業，以謀敎育之普及；一方面亦應該就個人的力量，資助淸寒學子，以幫助政府力量之不足，以减少國家社會之損失。所以申報館讀者助學金的倡導，可說是一件極有意義極有傻値的事功。</p>
<p>申報館辦理助學金，已歷四屆，一切手續，務求周密完備，以冀無負於捐助者的熱忱與信托。但欲謀事業的擴充與進展，仍不得不有賴於各方面的合作與協助。</p>
<p>第一，希望社會人士，本作育　才之旨，踴躍捐輸，源源資助，俾助學金事功，能維持永久，而助學的範園，得以逐漸擴充。</p>
<p>第二，希望能　力支付學費的家長，勿囑其子弟前來申請，因爲申請人衆多而助學金額有限，以免剝奪家境較差者的就學機會。同時希望家長對於獲得助學金的學生，加以督促和鼓勵，以無負於捐款人的</p>
<p>第三，希望學校當局在保舉學生前來申請之時，對於申請人的學業品格，加以愼密的審査。一個人的才智品格，必須經過長時間的觀察，才能有淸楚的認識，而決不能從一張成績表上看出來的。學校當局與學生，朝夕相處，觀察必較周密，認識自然淸楚。</p>
<p>十元不為少，萬元不為多</p>
<p>總之，助學金是一種社會事業，申報館不過是一個承辦機關。要事業辦得認眞而有效必需各方面社會人士的合作和協助。</p>

<h3 id="c74">甄別考試 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— 徐學海</p>
<p>上海男女靑年會對於救濟學生的工作，向來是很重視的，但是近年來由於經濟的原因，不得不先後停辦了學生經濟宿舍和淸寒學生獎學金生活津貼等等學生救濟工作。自然在生活艱難學生們更急待救濟的時候，我們却停止了自己的工作，這在我們實在是感到十二分的不安的。因此，申報爲淸寒學生舉辦的助學金，的確使我們感到十二分的欣慰，而且，我們更高興我們能够和申報共同爲著這許多優秀靑年盡一點小小的力量。</p>
<p>記得上屆甄別考試舉行時，正當溽暑蒸人，轉瞬間現在却又是西風凛冽的時候了。考試是許多「不用功」學生最頭痛的一件事，自然「眞金不怕火來燒」，這許多眞正努力於學業的學生，是再也不怕的。上决考試的範圍，是英文。國文·算術·常識，從這兒我們要測騐學生的眞正的學問，並且更要測騐他們對於學問的理解力和應用力。我們並不希望幫助爲分數而讀死書的學生，我們要選擇眞正致力於學業而且能應用並理解學問的優秀學生們。</p>
<p>淸晨的四川路是冷淸淸的，但在考試的那一天，却很早很早就擠滿了許多優秀的靑年。上下午共計高小·初中·高中·三塲考試，淸寒而優秀的學生們都懷著一個渴望著的臉，更懷著一顆渴望著的心，小心謹愼的進行著考試，尤其是高小的學生們，差不多祗有十歲左右，也許他們從沒有到過這樣遠的地方罷？他們年邁的母親，丟棄了「軋米」「洗菜」……等工作，老遠地親自送他們的兒女來參加考試，她們受盡了風霜摧殘的縐臉，似乎露出了一絲微笑，但眼角邊却隱隱地滾出一點晶瑩的又似感激又似希望的淚。一切的一切景象，使我深深的受到了極大的感動，我推想着本届的考試，無　在參加的人數方面，或是其他……一定更甚於往年了。</p>
<p>救濟工作表面上似乎是簡便的事務的，但要眞正達到百分之百的公允，合乎眞正的需要，却又是十二分的困難，我認爲申報館諸位同仁的熱誠和努力，並且對於工作不斷的改進，的確是做到了救濟工作最完滿的地步。這一點是値得向社會提出的，也是値得向熱心助學的諸君吿慰的。</p>

<p>余年幼失怙，十三歲即脫離小學而充學徒，從業餘暇入補習學校，以求進修。後在商界稍得寸進，痛定思痛，回想失學之苦，決計推已及人，乃於廿五年前創設二個商業補習學校於河南路：十餘年後，又設義學六所於滬郊。其中學成出而服務社會者不乏其人。</p>
<p>今申報讀者發起助學金，嘉惠失學靑年，實非淺鮮。今日之工商界從業員，亦即異日經濟　壘之礎石，其中儘多學養有素之人士，因家計艱困，月人有限，無力從事業餘進修者申報於大中小各組外，增設工商從業員組，蓋欲使店員學徒，得遂其業餘就學之願。</p>
<p>然受助者自身，應謀徹底自省，助學金之聚集蓋基於同情心而來，具有鼓勵苦　及爲社會育才之價値。入選諸生，獲此資助，不應視爲解決經濟上暫時之困厄，應視爲無上之榮譽。吾人一生最可寳貴之歷程，不外人助自助助人三者，今諸生旣獲人助，應如何敦品勵學，努力前程，而求自助之道，自助有餘。應有以助人。諸生今日之受助於社會者，他年必千百倍還諸社會，竊願以申報助學金　其　矢也。（黃友道）</p>
<h3 id="c76">生存與生活 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>生存是人的權利，所以每個人應該依着不同的方式來發展自己，旣有權利，當有義務，在負起此生存的義務時，必要承認別人生存的權利，你不必有代替別人發展生存的特權，更不應該讓別人替你生存。</p>
<p>生活的目的是改變人生，生活不斷地改進，世界也繼續地改變，這二種改進是同一方向的，不要怕改變，你應該要和世界一同改進到更好的境地</p>
<p>生活是生存的必要條件，生活愈是艱難，生存愈是堅强，堅强的生存是要緊隨着世界的現狀，使自己成爲世界的一環，雖然力景渺小，但如果每一環都能堅强，世界豈不是更穩固了嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c77">決心之後 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 英碩</p>
<p>「決心」果然是每一個有作爲的人所必需有的，但最重要的還是「決心」之後應當怎樣？</p>
<p>下了決心之後當然要實行牠，如果決心與實行如養媳婦與婆婆似的不敢碰頭，那麼儘管决心得天花亂墜，有聲有色：「只聞樓梯響，不見人下來，倒反而好像痴人說夢」，欺騙自己，憑白地與自己打要，並且還要使聽見你毅然下決心的旁觀者，伸長了頭頸儍等，如果一而再，再而三，也許會使你從此失去了自尊心與信用。所以我說：「如果沒有十二分把握時，還是不要下決心，旣下了決心，就得毅力地去幹。」</p>
<p>在現在的時髦人中，下決心已成了家常便飯，受到了一種刺激，立刻一個決心隨之而來，桌子拍得震天響，言語似赴義的壯士一般英雄氣慨充塞眉宇之間，看樣子似乎再不幹就不行了，可是等到怒平氣息，那決心也如橡皮泡似的洩氣了，一會兒又是一副乾　面孔了。</p>
<p>假使每一個決心之後，都能實行，那麼世界也不會那麼糟，人們也不會那麼痛苦了·</p>
<h3 id="c78">努力用功：即是·報·答·恩。惠　一個小學生 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>爸爸遠在加爾各答自從去年春天託親戚匯來一筆款項之後，不到幾個月，生活這樣高昂，當然都化完了。老實說，像我們這樣的一個家庭，要來申請助學，眞是怪羞慚的，然而去年夏天和冬天，要不是貴館的幫助，我小學五年級的學費，却是眞無所出。</p>
<p>當媽媽燈火課讀時，千叮萬囑，勉勵我用功讀書，嘗說，唯有努力，才可以報答貴報的恩惠。我刻刻記住，課餘看報，知道第四屆助學金又將開始，於萬分高興之下，便寫了這幾句。爸爸如果一旦回來，也不知道怎樣快樂呢！（我的成績，本學期均在八十分以上，並以報吿。）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Political Parties and Politics: Respectfully Offering Words to the Kuomintang <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Regarding current politics, our people must pay close attention, especially the opinion circles responsible for speaking out. In wartime, we should not remain silent and abandon our sacred duty.</p>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang has already concluded successfully in Nanjing. However, the Kuomintang's responsibility for the current era and the future Republic of China has only increased. Its relationship with the people of the whole country will also become closer. Therefore, the people cannot remain indifferent. And the Kuomintang leaders and Kuomintang members should always know to humbly listen to opinions from all sides. Standing from the people's standpoint, and from the standpoint of loving and protecting the Kuomintang, we respectfully wish to offer the following points:</p>
<p>First, we believe that the Kuomintang has a good goal for its future governance: that is, what the Chongqing regime said and did that has already failed, it will resolutely not repeat. Whatever the Chongqing regime could not resolve for the benefit of the country and the people, it must resolve for the people of the whole country to see. In that way, on the one hand, it can avoid the path of failure that the Chongqing regime encountered, and on the other hand, it can establish a strong belief in the Kuomintang among the people. For example, where did the Chongqing regime fail? Everyone who cares about Chinese politics knows that it failed because the party was manipulated by a small number of people, especially by Chiang and his relatives, which made the party lose its original face. In particular, the so-called supreme leader of the party lacked the necessary magnanimity of a great statesman, worrying day and night about the people's efforts to expand, and researching day and night how to stifle public opinion, instead of starting with the internal rectification and improvement of the party. This led to the prestige of the government and the party declining day by day. The result was that factions within the party were divided, fighting each other for power and profit; and party members at all levels only knew how to rely on the power of the party to make a fortune from the national crisis, using the name of resisting the war to seek selfish gain, putting the interests of the country and the difficulties of the people's livelihood completely behind their minds, and thus the party became the center of people's resentment. Therefore, they said every day "one party, one doctrine, one leader", but this party, this doctrine, this leader, declined day by day. The collapse and decline of the Chongqing regime and the Chongqing Kuomintang is truly the best mirror. At the same time, the main problems that the Chongqing regime could not solve for the benefit of the country and the people were the food problem, the price problem, the corruption problem, and all problems related to improving the people's lives. We hope that the Nanjing National Government will have the strength and methods to seek thorough solutions. In this way, in the positive aspect, it can refresh the people's minds, and those who have been watching coldly in the past will naturally support and endorse it. At that time, the authority of the government and the party will be "high" without being "raised". At that time, even if they do not say "one party, one doctrine, one leader", the people of the whole country will naturally sincerely acknowledge that China only has this "one party, one doctrine, one leader"!</p>
<p>Secondly, the close relationship between a political party and politics is a fact known to all. If a country has a good political party, the country will prosper and develop. Similarly, if a country has a bad political party, it will make the country and the people suffer endlessly. However, although the position of a political party in a country's politics is important, one point is very clear, that is, there must be a country's existence before there can be a political party's position, that is to say, only when the country is strong can the party's power be strong; conversely, if the country is poor and weak and unable to be independent, and only knows the development of one party, as the "Chongqing Kuomintang" did today, then it will only accelerate the demise of the country and the nation, and eventually dig its own grave. Therefore, all modern political parties supported by the people must be political parties that "worry before the world worries, and enjoy after the world enjoys", and must be political parties that put the interests of the country and the people first, and not the interests of their own party first. And all modern political parties that consolidate their party foundation and strengthen their party power must also be the political parties that are most able to sacrifice and fight for the interests of the country and the interests of the people. Therefore, we hope that the Nanjing genuine Kuomintang, which is for the country and the people, will shout a few less rotten slogans that have been ruined by the Chongqing "Kuomintang", and do more things that can win the praise and support of the people of the whole country, and do more things that are of practical benefit to the country, the nation, and the broad masses of the people. At that time, it will truly enhance the authority of the party and the credibility of the party.</p>
<p>Our words may be too straightforward, but our sincerity to the gentlemen of the Kuomintang lies precisely in these straightforward sentences. We sincerely hope that the gentlemen will have something to refresh the minds of all the people, and something to live up to the expectations of our country, our nation, and the great new era!</p>

<p>Berlin, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - Haitong News Agency received information yesterday from responsible sources here that the battle for the German stronghold of Rzhev, which has been going on for two weeks, had subsided by Thursday. The Soviet command sent a large army to block the German troops coming to Rzhev's aid, but the German troops surged like a tide. The Soviet infantry launched several determined, fierce attacks, but after failing, they had to retreat under the cover of artillery fire. German transport planes continue to supply the besieged German garrison in Rzhev with ammunition and supplies.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 15th (Havas News Agency) - Fierce fighting continued on the Eastern Front yesterday. According to Red Army communiques, the Red Army has advanced towards northern Caucasus, central Don region, and the Kalmyk Steppe. Soviet aircraft were active over Stalingrad. The Red Army in that area has advanced 600 yards. German troops in the lower Don region launched fierce counterattacks under the cover of tanks and artillery, but were repelled. According to German sources, German troops in the Stalingrad area and the Caucasus continue to reorganize front lines and conduct fierce defensive battles. Fierce fighting continues northwest of Stalingrad. 75 Red Army tanks were destroyed. Red Army offensives southeast of Lake Ilmen and near Lake Ladoga were also repelled. German-Finnish aircraft groups bombed the Red Army railway on the frozen Lake Ladoga yesterday. The food supply route to Leningrad has been cut off.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The war situation on the Eastern Front up to the 15th is as follows: 1. In the Swir area, the Soviet army has now mobilized all heavy weapons, tanks, and sniper units to launch fierce attacks day and night, engaging in bloody battles with the German army. However, after fierce fighting, they were all repelled by the German army, and 35 Soviet tanks were destroyed. There is no change in the German positions in that area. 2. In the area between the Volga and the Don, the Soviet army attempted to encircle the main force of the German army in this area, so it tried to launch fierce attacks. German armored units broke into the Soviet positions from several sides. After confused fighting, the Soviet army was defeated, and 19 Soviet tanks were destroyed. In addition, the German air force cooperated with the army to attack the Soviet rear, destroying 66 Soviet transport vehicles and shooting down 6 Soviet aircraft.</p>

<p>Today, one year after the start of the Greater East Asia War, our citizens of the Republic of China, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, are directly advancing on the path to annihilating Britain and the United States. What a magnificent and great undertaking this is!</p>
<p>The British and American imperialists have been aggressively invading East Asia, not only regarding East Asia as their colony and exercising their aggressive ambitions in terms of economy, culture, and military affairs, but also plotting a hundred schemes to bewitch our people of East Asia and make them kill each other, in order to achieve their evil plans. For a hundred years, our East Asia has suffered from their poison, and it would be impossible to list all the evils. Today, our citizens of the Republic of China have become aware of this and know that the most important thing is to expel Britain and the United States, just as a patient must eliminate germs. If people want to be healthy, there is only one way to eliminate germs. At the same time, because the power of germs to lurk and spread has not been achieved in a single day, it is necessary to unite with good doctors to thoroughly disinfect them, and these germs can never be completely eliminated, and this sick man can never be healthy. If we do not want to be sick men for a long time, we should take this opportunity today to work together with one heart and one mind to do disinfection work and to drive out the forces of Britain and the United States completely, so that our physical strength can gradually be strengthened and our health can gradually recover. This is a matter of life and death for us, and we must not neglect it. We should know that China accounts for nearly half of the population of East Asia in terms of population, so if we can bring into play our country's potential, there will be no fear of a shortage of material resources, and human resources will naturally be abundant. With limitless material resources and limitless human resources, if we can work together with our allies to cope with the war, the victory can be predicted. However, even though our country possesses this condition of certain victory, we must be diligent at all times and know how to use these material resources to make our country prosperous and our people live in peace, and how to use these human resources to make our soldiers strong and our people healthy. On the part of the government, it is fully responsible for guiding and supervising, while on the part of the people, they must also share the difficulties of the times and rise up to wash away the century-old humiliation of British and American aggression against our country. This requires the greatest determination. You must know that our country's participation in the war today is standing on the same battle line of life and death with our ally Japan in order to achieve the rapid completion of the Greater East Asia War, and at the same time, it is also seeking the early realization of peace. The day the war is completed will be the day peace is realized. We, the people of East Asia, are fighting for East Asia, and we cannot separate ourselves from East Asia. Peace is the goal, and war is the means. We seek peace through war. We are willing to wage war for the sake of permanent peace. As the ancients said, "Those who do not labor once will not have long leisure; those who do not spend temporarily will not have lasting peace." We today seek peace and tranquility by meeting the words "labor" and "spend". Gentlemen, do not be afraid of labor, and even more do not be afraid of expense. You must know that these two words are the way out for our Republic of China and the way out for our 400 million people.</p>

<p>Bern, Switzerland, 15th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>The North African war continues to be dominated by U.S. Flying Fortresses bombing German supply ports and German aircraft attacking British concentration points. In addition, French rebel troops, covered by the U.S. Air Force and tank units, attacked Axis positions again yesterday in the mountainous area of southern Tunisia. The French suffered heavy casualties and retreated after several hours of fierce fighting. There has been no fighting of any kind on other fronts in Tunisia except for air battles. However, there were large-scale troop movements yesterday behind the British lines in the Medjez el Bab area, indicating that a major battle will occur there at any time. A Reuters military correspondent returned from inspecting the North African front and said that the Allied forces in that area were in an unfavorable situation. The German retreat according to the predetermined plan was extremely effective. The British pursuit has cut off the communication lines, and the Germans have quickly built defenses along the northeastern coast. It will still take some time for the British First Army to attack them.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 15th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>According to British and Axis sources, the fighting on the Tunisian and Libyan fronts intensified again yesterday. French splinter troops occupied new defensive areas in central Tunisia and fought Axis forces in the Gafsa area. The U.S. Air Force bombed the ports of Sousse and Sfax and Axis ships in the Gulf of Gabes. The Axis Air Force also bombed the port of Bone, hitting one U.S. destroyer and shooting down 28 British and American aircraft. As for Libya, both sides' reconnaissance troops were very active near Bir Terfaui. Axis aircraft also attacked the ports of Sirte and Benghazi. According to British newspapers, the Tunisian war has stalled, not only due to the harsh climate, but also due to difficult transportation south of Gafsa.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - Eleven U.S. fighter planes were forced to land at the Saca da Mulher airfield in Lisbon at around 3:00 PM yesterday (local time). According to the crew members of the U.S. aircraft that were forced to land, this was due to a lack of gasoline. Their aircraft have been confiscated by the Portuguese authorities, and the crew members have been detained. Yesterday morning, 40 to 50 U.S. aircraft flew south over Alcobaça, 100 kilometers north of Lisbon.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - After eleven U.S. aircraft simultaneously made emergency landings in Portuguese territory, speculation has arisen in various quarters. Some say that these aircraft flew out from a sunken aircraft carrier and were forced to land because they ran out of fuel. Others say that these aircraft were flying in a group from the Mediterranean to North Africa, but if that were true, they must have carried enough gasoline. Others say that the pilots were inexperienced and lost their way, eventually running out of gasoline and landing. However, it is unlikely that eleven aircraft would lose their way at the same time. Therefore, this matter may be a pre-planned scheme, which is not impossible.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - The sudden appearance of eleven U.S. military aircraft at the Lisbon airport has caused surprise and anxiety among the people here. After Allied aircraft first flew over Portuguese territory in mid-November of last year, the Portuguese government officially protested. There are deep fears here that even if the Portuguese authorities protest again, it will be ineffective. The Portuguese believe that there must be a behind-the-scenes plan for the U.S. aircraft to land. Therefore, there is a deep sense of unease here.</p>

<p>– Jia Yuan</p>
<p>– Transmitted from Australia on January 5th –</p>
<p>(Editor's note: The previous three sections of this article were published in the "Free Talk" section of this newspaper on January 11, 12, and 13.)</p>
<p>Visiting Mr. Ao Gan</p>
<p>After staying in Kalimpong for several days, the problem of entering Tibet remained unresolved. That evening, I visited Mr. Cheng, who had traveled in the same car. Mr. Cheng was formerly employed at the "Border Affairs Office of the General Staff Headquarters" and was always very enthusiastic. Because this was our first meeting, I did not dare to reveal my true intentions immediately. At this point, I could only be honest. I was grateful for Mr. Cheng's kindness in introducing me to Mr. Ao Gan.</p>
<p>Mr. Ao was a local Tibetan official who, dissatisfied with the obstinate conservatism of the Tibetan government, launched an attack against the Tibetan government in the 24th year of the Republic, together with his son, leading his troops and the armed forces of Xikang. However, due to the failure of Xikang to provide support, the effort unfortunately failed. He then went to Nanjing and worked for the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. He has lived in Kalimpong since the 25th year of the Republic. The Tibetan government has repeatedly requested his return to Tibet to resume his duties, but he has refused. He is a diligent scholar and fluent in English. He has always held positive feelings towards Chinese people. In the past, Ms. Liu Manqing and other individuals who entered Tibet relied on Mr. Ao's assistance. Therefore, when I visited him, Mr. Ao welcomed me warmly.</p>
<p>Mr. Ao's residence is located on the side of the road at the entrance of Kalimpong, a beautiful building. During our meeting, he expressed great concern for national construction, and I responded to each of his points.</p>
<p>Later, when we discussed Sino-Tibetan relations, he expressed strong agreement with the Three Principles of the People's nationalism. He also told me, "The Tibetan people only know how to recite scriptures and are ignorant of any ideologies in the world. Therefore, I specifically translated the Three Principles of the People into Tibetan and submitted it to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for review. Unfortunately, due to interrupted communication and inconvenient transportation, it has been difficult. I am currently trying to have the Consul General in Calcutta forward it."</p>
<p>Finally, regarding my entry into Tibet, he immediately agreed to take responsibility and told me that it would be better to hire someone specifically to escort me in, rather than accompanying Tibetan merchants. Moreover, the necessary permits could be obtained at any time, which would be faster than waiting for Tibetan merchants. Therefore, I decided to entrust him with hiring someone to escort me and to assist with obtaining the necessary clothing. However, since registration with the police station was also required, we agreed to travel to Darjeeling. Upon returning, we would find a quieter place and wait for the right time to depart, so that I would not be obstructed again.</p>
<p>Trip to Darjeeling</p>
<p>With everything arranged, I drove to the police station to register on the afternoon of the 26th. After leaving Kalimpong, I headed towards Siliguri. Due to the wind and rain that day, I arrived in Siliguri at dusk. It was precisely the time when the southbound train was departing. Trains from Darjeeling and Kurseong were connecting at this time, making the station extremely crowded. Only after the southbound train departed did the station gradually become quiet. Since the Siliguri area is small, there are no hotel facilities. The train to Darjeeling was scheduled for 8:00 AM the next morning, so I spent the night in the waiting room.</p>
<p>The journey from Siliguri to Darjeeling is approximately 70 miles. A second-class ticket costs seven and a half rupees. The train is extremely small, even smaller than ordinary light rail. When departing, two trains depart simultaneously. Each locomotive can only pull three carriages, carrying fewer than a hundred passengers. In the carriage I was in, there were only four passengers, three of whom were British officers. The train traveled very slowly, so those with private cars chose to drive directly.</p>
<p>After leaving the station, the train gradually ascended, winding along the mountain. At each stop, the locomotive's mechanisms had to be inspected, especially the brakes, which had to have their screws tightened to prevent slippage. When reaching the halfway point, due to the steepness of the mountain, passengers had to disembark and walk. The locomotive underwent a very lengthy inspection before it could proceed. Along the way, whenever the train reached a hairpin turn, it had to move forward and backward to gradually ascend. The slow speed was a stark contrast to cars. Those on the train felt extremely anxious, but the scenery was beautiful, with shaded forests and white clouds floating above. Upon reaching the summit and gazing at the boundless sky, one felt as if they had ascended to heaven. After reaching the mountaintop, there were many larger villages and towns. It took a total of six and a half hours to reach Darjeeling.</p>
<p>Upon exiting the station, there was an asphalt road, with layers of mountains connecting above and below. There were many beautiful buildings, as this place was originally a popular summer resort, reaching an altitude of 7,000 feet with an excellent climate. Therefore, many Westerners owned villas here. Below the main street were the markets and residential areas for Indians and other ethnicities. There was also an elevated cable car for transporting goods.</p>
<p>Walking a hundred meters along the avenue led to a bustling urban area with various shops lining both sides, much larger than the Kalimpong urban area. There were also many tourists on the street, with the sound of horses' hooves constantly echoing. Rickshaws were available, but their design was slightly different, requiring two people to pull each car. I stayed at the Central Hotel on the side of the road, where a room cost over ten shields per day (including room and board, equivalent to over a hundred national currency). The prices of higher-end rooms could reach dozens of shields, catering to wealthier guests, so their facilities were extremely elaborate to meet the demands of tourists.</p>

<p>Regarding the rationing of sugar by population, which will begin in the Nanshi area next month, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has submitted an application to the Municipal Police Headquarters for assistance in registering households for sugar rations. After receiving the submission, the headquarters has ordered all public offices in the district to instruct all chiefs to fill out the forms in detail in order to comprehensively plan the quantity of sugar to be rationed. Although rationing sugar by population within the concessions has been approved by the relevant authorities, implementation still faces difficulties. Therefore, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office is currently considering other methods to alleviate the threat of sugar shortages within the concessions.</p>

<p>Since the Public Works Department announced that all noodle product businesses would implement a system of exchanging flour for noodle products, various noodle product trade associations, such as the machine-made noodles industry, the pancake, steamed bun, and fried dough stick industry, and the cooked noodle groups of noodle restaurants, have successively submitted petitions requesting the authorities to revise the newly established regulations. According to reports from Datong News Agency reporters, the Public Works Department has been studying these petitions separately after receiving them. It is learned that the cooked noodle groups of noodle restaurants have been granted a reply allowing them to continue receiving flour rations, but only for the raw materials (flour) of cooked noodles sold within the restaurants. Those that sell and deliver to customers outside the restaurant in small quantities will not be rationed. As for the requests from the machine-made noodles industry and the pancake, steamed bun, and fried dough stick industry to resume flour rations, it is learned that the Public Works Department is still considering them.</p>

This oil sale is scheduled for four days, and sales will stop after today (the 17th). It is heard that the cooking oil wholesale office will not handle oil matters before the end of the lunar year.

<h3 id="e50">The Problem of Rice Subsidies for Mainland Teachers <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>In the mainland, calls for increased and improved living standards for civil servants and teachers have been incessant. Below is another teacher's complaint about the issue of rice subsidies. He states: Here are a few points we feel strongly about.</p>
<p>(1) It is already the end of October, but the subsidized rice allowance has only been paid up to June, with a partial advance for July. Rice prices are constantly rising, and the difference between buying November rice with July's rice allowance is indescribable. (In July, cotton was 18 yuan per catty, now it is 44 yuan per catty). The rice subsidy, originally intended to provide urgent relief, is delayed for months. What is the reason for this? Is it the government's policy? Or is it the school authorities' irresponsibility?</p>
<p>(2) The poverty of teachers' lives is undeniable. However, 10% of our October salary has been forcibly deducted and converted into savings bonds (the money is deducted, but the savings bonds are not issued). Savings are certainly beneficial to both the country and the individual, but how can we make ten-year savings plans when we can't even afford basic necessities? We don't think the government needs to absorb floating capital from our meager incomes, do they?</p>
<p>(3) We also hear that 10% of our November salary has been decided to be deducted for the purchase of gliders to expand gliding activities. I wholeheartedly support gliding activities, but while it is necessary to develop sports, people's livelihoods must also be considered. Methods to improve our lives have yet to be implemented, while salary deductions have been piled on one after another! And tens of thousands of public bonds are unfairly deducted from our salaries. We have no room to reduce clothing or food expenses. We hope that the people's responsibility will be fairly and reasonably distributed, and that attention will not be focused solely on us, the suffering masses!</p>

First, a wooden pavilion two square zhang wide, placed in the field, was ignited with kerosene. In an instant, the pavilion was filled with thick smoke, and the fire was raging. Then, a glass fire extinguishing bomb filled with blue liquid was thrown into it. Before long, the flame was extinguished, a very good result.

<p>Yesterday's Chinese stock market was robust. It was a Saturday holiday, but a few colleagues were still trading in secret. Market prices were quite strong. The World Book Company in the cultural industry broke through the 120 yuan mark, and Commercial Press and China Book Company were also advancing rapidly. Transactions in the public utility sector picked up and rose sharply. Department store stocks, new pharmaceutical stocks, and textile stocks were mostly stable. Overall, market sentiment was optimistic, but transaction volume was not high. A list is provided below.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Public Bonds Rarely Sought After <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The public bond market was even quieter. Because it was Saturday, both buyers and sellers were not enthusiastic. Therefore, very few people inquired about them. The environment dictated that it was difficult to expand. Only Category C bonds had some transactions, with high prices at 1.34 yuan and low prices at 0.05 yuan, finally around 1 yuan. Category A was around 0.078 yuan, Category D around 9 yuan, and Category E around 50 yuan. The trend is fluctuating. It is feared that it will close down within the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Joint Currency Rises, Interbank Lending Rate Stable <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate of the Money Dealers Association was 0.17 yuan, unchanged.</p>
<p>The Japanese military notes were stable. The inter-dealer price was 5.5534 yuan. Small money shops and silver shops had a price of 5.5564 yuan as the bid and ask price. The joint bank notes fell to a low of 1.57 yuan and then rose again, with the final bid and ask price at 2.63 and 2.68 yuan, a rise of 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Woolen Fabrics Rise to Limit Price <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Due to the frequent shortage of woolen fabric inventory, raw materials such as fine wool thread are difficult to find even at high prices, and coarse wool fabric is also the same. Furthermore, because Zhejiang and Hubei wool has been contracted and controlled by the four major merchants, broken tweed is sold for 20 yuan per catty, but it is still impossible to obtain large quantities, resulting in a continuous lack of products from Sino-Japanese factories. Market sentiment is upward, demand exceeds supply, and speculation is getting heavier. Prices are rising step by step. Recently, there have been rumors that large shipping orders will be released, which has further stimulated market sentiment and raised prices. Most of the cavalry twill, tuosjin, feather yarn tweed, pileece, vaildeng, white drill, screw tweed, pan tweed, water repellent, and spring light tweed have all risen to the limit price. Among them, many have exceeded it. Yesterday, ordinary pileece was selling for 120 yuan to 175 yuan per yard, vaildeng for 160 yuan to 225 yuan, feather yarn tweed for 130 yuan to 170 yuan, and pan tweed for 200 yuan to 250 yuan. These are all local factory goods manufactured in Shanghai. Shin Lian and Xin Ma rubber cloth are all shouting 11.50 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Soybean Cake Transactions Quiet, Market Sentiment Softens <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, miscellaneous grain transactions were sparse, and the supply and demand for soybeans remained quiet. Soybean cake transactions also decreased, and market sentiment softened. The price of one truckload of Yuan team soybean cake was 95.5 yuan, and two truckloads of Fei character soybean cake were priced at 95.5 yuan to 94.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Soap Continues to Rise <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Japanese-made soap has a unique advantage in the market, while candles are fluctuating. Matches rose first and then stabilized. Gu Ben soap was 625 yuan, Bai Xiangmao was 590 yuan, Huang Xiangmao was 545 yuan, and Scissor soap was 610 yuan, all up 5 to 10 yuan from the previous day. Phoenix brand matches were 3,300 yuan, Beauty brand was 3,500 yuan, Golden Tripod brand was 2,800 yuan, and miscellaneous brands were 2,150 yuan. White Lee's candles were 580 yuan, Monk Hat brand was 540 yuan, and Brand candles were 350 yuan.</p>

<p>The cigarette market has been rising recently. The China Tobacco Consortium's establishment in the Lunar New Year is difficult to achieve because the procedures have not been completed in time. Furthermore, because sales are about to expand, actual sales are quite strong. Later, due to frequent news of profit-taking, market sentiment loosened slightly, but the result was still strong. Prices were as follows: Great Britain brand 1,100 yuan, Old Knife brand 9,800 yuan, Pin Hai brand 7,700 yuan, Five Hua brand 6,800 yuan, Fairy brand 7,950 yuan, Japanese Tobacco Gold Gun brand 3,150 yuan, Golden Mansion 3,850 yuan, Red Rose 2,350 yuan, Full Rank brand 3,400 yuan, 20 Branch 3,200 yuan, Guide brand 2,800 yuan, National Tobacco Pyramid 6,300 yuan, Beauty brand 5,700 yuan, Golden Mouse brand 4,200 yuan, White Gold Dragon 4,100 yuan. As a result, Anglo-American goods continued to rise, Japanese tobacco slightly declined, and national tobacco was stable.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Firewood Arrivals Slightly Increase <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Since the city's cars switched to burning firewood, firewood has been used to start fires, leading to even more robust sales. Later, due to unstable supply, firewood merchants with existing inventory took the opportunity to hoard and raise prices. When the month arrived, pine firewood was selling for 44-45 yuan per dan, and chestnut firewood was selling for 46-47 yuan per dan. More recently, the supply has slightly increased, and market prices have fallen. Currently, pine firewood is selling for 41-42 yuan per dan, chestnut firewood for 45 yuan, and scattered miscellaneous firewood for around 40 yuan per dan, a decrease of 1-2 yuan to 3-4 yuan compared to the previous period.

<h3 id="e65">Rebar Steel and Bearing Steel Transactions Quiet <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The sales of ribbed steel have been stagnant for a long time. The construction industry is declining, and it is difficult for factories and customers to expand sales, resulting in a quiet market atmosphere. Prices are flat and sluggish, and insiders believe that the price limits prevent brisk sales. Yesterday, 40-foot No. 1 goods were priced at 11,000 yuan per ton, and first-class goods were priced at around 8,000 yuan per ton.</p>
<p>The transactions of 4, 5, and 6-fen old bearing steel remained idle yesterday. There were few sales from factories, and sales to customers have long been cut off. Retail sales in this district were also not strong, leading to flat and soft market sentiment among insiders. Currently, 4, 5, and 6-fen various types of old bearing steel and Double Horse steel are priced at around 850 yuan per case.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, various industrial raw materials still lacked formal market prices. The temporary prices at which transactions were made are published below.</p>
<p>Zinc oxide 45,000 yuan</p>
<p>Eastern bleaching powder tinh 3,600 yuan</p>
<p>Italian bleaching powder tinh 44,000 yuan</p>
<p>Stirling US 5,200 yuan 6,200 yuan</p>
<p>Borax per bag 1,500 yuan</p>
<h3 id="e66">Not Many Yellow Sand and Gravel Arrivals; Asking Prices are High, Leading to Soaring Sales <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Yellow sand and gravel are building materials with very high sales volumes. In previous years, Chinese merchants procured them from the mainland, but since 1938, the authorities have listed yellow sand and gravel as military supplies and implemented a system where a certain quantity of incoming goods is used for military purposes, with the remainder available for commercial use. However, yellow sand is produced in Zhejiang Province's Huanglong and Sijiao, and gravel is produced in the small mountains around Songting County in Jiangsu Province. Currently, Chinese merchants still procure them and transport them to Shanghai, but they are managed by Hengchan and the Jiangnan Company. The current price for commercial goods is calculated based on cost. Yellow sand is sold for around 80 yuan per ton in storage notes when delivered on ships in Yangshupu, and 85-86 yuan per ton when purchased at the stall. Gravel is sold for 75 yuan per ton, but it is not easy to find large quantities of spot goods at once. Yesterday, Yongyu and other boats, No. 115, transported about 250 tons of yellow sand from Sijiao and Huanglong, totaling three ships, which were moored in Yangshupu awaiting unloading. The shipowners offered the yellow sand for sale at a tea party yesterday, asking 90 yuan per ton. It is said that the cost of this shipment of yellow sand is very high, and the asking price is also expensive.</p>

<p>Recently, the supply of northern goods has suddenly been cut off. Japanese currency has been tightening in secret, and the Lunar New Year is about to end, so transactions have suddenly become quiet. Jiyang tongshou dates are priced at 590 yuan, Xiang Er Gaozhuang dates are priced at 700-750 yuan, Tou Gaozhuang dates are 850-900 yuan, Cangzhou red head dates are priced at 620 yuan, Xinxiang lotus seeds are 3,100 yuan, sunflower seeds are 400 yuan, Tianjin Nanzhi seeds are 550 yuan, Liuhe Nanzhi seeds are 600 yuan, Taigu seeds are 700 yuan, Benying melon seeds are 620-650 yuan, Guzhen seeds are 620 yuan, Jiaozhou seeds are 600 yuan, and Jizhong seeds are 750 yuan.

<h3 id="e68">Enthusiastically Support the Student Aid Campaign <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Siliang</p>
<p>The Shen Bao reader's student aid campaign began in the summer of 1941. I, as a member of the committee, have been involved in the review process. The gentlemen at the meeting, witnessing the list of student applications, were moved by the selection or rejection of each case. Those who were selected were deeply congratulated, and those who were still under consideration were carefully reviewed, again and again, either through re-investigation or by inviting them to meet in person, so that the student aid funds would not be wasted, and poor students would receive real benefits. Each session has been carefully managed, which is the shared feeling of the committee members and myself.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao, with its goal of serving society, has worked diligently in all its undertakings, upholding the highest standards of fairness. Essay topics are entrusted to experts, and final decisions are made by the committee. The staff work diligently on administrative matters, and even cover expenses out of their own pockets. This spirit has endured for a long time. Therefore, each student aid session ends with the large sum of aid money almost entirely disbursed, and at the beginning of the next session, as soon as it is announced, enthusiastic people in society will automatically donate. Before a month has passed, a large sum is collected. This is because like-minded people respond enthusiastically, and society's great sympathy often arises unexpectedly. Thinking about this, I am deeply moved.</p>
<p>I believe that social relief work is very complex, but its significance and achievements are greatest in student aid. Giving to the poor can only provide temporary relief, while student aid is a positive act that allows those who have lost the opportunity to study to return to school and become talented individuals. After ten or twenty years, countless healthy individuals will be trained, who will work hard to produce and benefit society. Young people are the pillars of the country, and it is right to establish a strong foundation for them. Is its long-term effect and wide-ranging influence not better than temporary almsgiving? Furthermore, benevolence and generosity are traditional virtues of the Chinese people. When society has good deeds, it is generous in donating and doing its best. However, when initiating good deeds, it seems that careful consideration should be given to which provides urgent relief today and which has a long-term effect in the future. Weighing the importance, knowing what to choose, student aid is a good deed that should be advocated!</p>
<p>Recently, the world has been changing rapidly, and livelihoods are difficult. Where can young people who have lost the opportunity to study turn? Their last hope is to apply for student aid. Now, as the fourth student aid campaign begins, I sincerely hope that enthusiastic people in society will contribute what they can to support this good deed. It is hoped that the current aid funds will reach a considerable amount, and the scope of student aid will become more widespread. It is not only the poor students who benefit from this, but also society's nurturing of talent and the country's cultivation of vitality.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Giving Education <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Gaoyi</p>
<p>Readers may find the phrase "giving education" not very smooth, because I just created it. The reason I wanted to create this term is that the terms "giving clothing," "giving porridge," "giving medicine," and "giving materials" are already very common. Society recognizes that any work with the word "giving" is a charitable act, and is willing to embrace the idea of "the greatest happiness lies in doing good," generously donating five hundred or a thousand yuan. Therefore, I thought that if student aid could also bask in the glory, like squeezing rice, squeezing into the ranks of "giving," letting everyone recognize it as a form of charity, perhaps it would be easier to raise funds.</p>
<p>Originally, the loss of education for children and youth is the precursor to the inability and powerlessness of adults; in other words, it also increases the number of candidates in society who lack clothing and food. Therefore, if society considers giving clothing and porridge as acts of charity, then I believe that "giving education" to poor students is the best of charitable acts! Because it is already too late for a person to need clothing and porridge; therefore, giving clothing and porridge is only a passive form of charity. If we can "give education" to poor students, so that they do not lose the opportunity to study now and can become useful talents for society in the future, then not only can we reduce the number of candidates for giving clothing and porridge in this generation, but we can also profit upon profit, and in the future, they can go out to "give education" and reduce the number of candidates for giving clothing and porridge in the next generation. In this way, generation after generation, society will progress generation after generation, which is a positive form of charity.</p>
<p>Therefore, I deeply hope that the great philanthropists in society, in addition to being happy to do passive charitable acts such as giving clothing and porridge, can also do more positive charitable acts—that is, giving education!</p>
<h3 id="e70">Hope that the Industrial and Commercial Sectors Will Jointly Support the Student Aid Campaign <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Zongyu</p>
<p>In Shanghai, due to the continuous increase in the cost of living, the problem of youth losing the opportunity to study has become increasingly serious. On the one hand, due to the cost of living, the amount of tuition is higher in the second semester than in the first. Currently, the cost of a primary school student per semester can exceed the cost of a university student before August 13, and the cost of a middle school student per semester can exceed the cost of a student studying abroad before August 13. At the same time, the family living expenses of each student's parents can exceed ten years' worth before August 13. Under these circumstances, how can the number of young people who have lost the opportunity to study not increase sharply!</p>
<p>However, since August 13, most industrial and commercial sectors have made very good profits due to the continuous rise in prices. It is countless how many have transformed from a capital of tens of thousands of yuan to millions of yuan. The only ones who suffer are the general salaried class, who truly cannot make ends meet and live from hand to mouth. Who does not love their children, and who does not hope that their children will become talented? But they are helpless due to a lack of ability. Therefore, I sincerely request that industrial and commercial capitalists each contribute a certain amount of cash to donate to this newspaper's student aid fund. Taking from society one thousand and returning to society one is originally easy, but society has already benefited greatly. If industrial and commercial capitalists only move their compassionate hearts, it will not be difficult for this newspaper's student aid fund to accumulate a great sum in a very short period, and the problem of young people losing the opportunity to study can be completely solved. "If a person wants to be good, who is not like me?" I believe that this year's donations to the student aid fund will definitely increase more rapidly than before!</p>

<h3 id="e72">Three Hopes <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Qingshi</p>
<p>The most regrettable thing in society is the loss of opportunity for talented and ambitious young students to study due to economic constraints. This is not only a personal misfortune, but a society's irreparable loss. Originally, the opportunity to enjoy education is a right that the people should have; providing educational opportunities is an obligation that the state should fulfill to the people. My country's education has not yet been popularized, and middle and high school education is beyond the reach of families below the middle class. I can only sigh at how many talented and promising young people have been buried in the process. From the people's standpoint, on the one hand, we should urge the government to increase education funding and expand education programs to promote the popularization of education; on the other hand, we should also use our personal strength to support poor students in order to help make up for the government's lack of strength and to reduce the losses to the country and society. Therefore, the initiation of the Shen Bao Reader Student Aid Fund is a very meaningful and valuable undertaking.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao has been running the student aid fund for four sessions, and all procedures are aimed at being thorough and complete, so as not to let down the enthusiasm and trust of donors. However, to seek the expansion and development of the undertaking, we still have to rely on cooperation and assistance from all parties.</p>
<p>First, it is hoped that people from all walks of life, with the aim of cultivating talent, will donate generously and provide continuous assistance, so that the student aid fund can be maintained permanently, and the scope of student aid can be gradually expanded.</p>
<p>Second, it is hoped that parents who are able to afford tuition fees will not ask their children to apply, because there are many applicants and the amount of aid is limited, so as not to deprive those from poorer families of the opportunity to study. At the same time, it is hoped that parents will urge and encourage students who receive student aid, so as not to let down the donors.</p>
<p>Third, it is hoped that school authorities, when recommending students to apply, will carefully examine the applicant's academic performance and character. A person's talent and character must be observed over a long period of time to have a clear understanding, and it cannot be determined from a report card alone. School authorities and students spend time together day and night, so their observations are bound to be more thorough and their understanding is naturally clearer.</p>
<p>Ten yuan is not too little, ten thousand yuan is not too much.</p>
<p>In short, student aid is a social undertaking, and the Shen Bao is only an organizing body. To run the undertaking seriously and effectively, the cooperation and assistance of people from all walks of life are necessary.</p>

<p>— Xu Xuehai</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA/YWCA has always attached great importance to the work of assisting students. However, in recent years, due to economic reasons, it has had to successively suspend student welfare initiatives such as student economic dormitories, scholarships for impoverished students, and living subsidies. Naturally, at a time when students are experiencing greater financial difficulties and are in urgent need of assistance, our decision to halt our own work makes us feel deeply uneasy. Therefore, the scholarship fund organized by the Shen Bao for impoverished students is truly a source of great comfort to us. Furthermore, we are even more pleased that we can work together with the Shen Bao to contribute in a small way to these outstanding young people.</p>
<p>I remember when the screening examination for the previous session was held, it was during the sweltering heat of summer. Now, in the blink of an eye, it's the season of chilling westerly winds again. Examinations are the bane of many "lazy" students, but of course, "true gold fears not the fire's burning." These students who genuinely strive in their studies have nothing to fear. The scope of the examination included English, Chinese, Arithmetic, and General Knowledge. Through this, we aimed to assess the students' genuine knowledge, and more importantly, their comprehension and application skills. We do not wish to assist students who study solely for grades; we want to select outstanding students who are truly dedicated to their studies and are capable of applying and understanding knowledge.</p>
<p>Sichuan Road is usually quiet in the early morning, but on the day of the examination, it was crowded with many outstanding young people very early on. The three examination sessions, for higher primary, junior middle, and senior middle school students, took place in the morning and afternoon. Impoverished yet outstanding students, with eager faces and hopeful hearts, carefully and cautiously proceeded with the examination. Especially the higher primary school students, who were mostly only around ten years old, perhaps had never been to such a distant place before. Their elderly mothers, abandoning tasks like "husking rice" and "washing vegetables," traveled from afar to personally bring their children to participate in the examination. The weathered and wrinkled faces seemed to reveal a hint of a smile, but at the corners of their eyes, one could faintly see crystal-clear tears, both of gratitude and hope. All of these scenes deeply moved me. I presume that this year's examination, in terms of the number of participants or other aspects, will certainly surpass previous years.</p>
<p>Relief work, on the surface, seems to be a simple matter, but achieving absolute fairness and truly meeting genuine needs is extremely difficult. I believe that the enthusiasm and efforts of the staff at the Shen Bao, along with their continuous improvements to the work, have indeed brought the relief work to the most perfect level. This is worth mentioning to the public and is also worth reassuring to all those who are enthusiastic about helping students.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Industrial and Commercial Employees Given the Opportunity to Study <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>I lost my father at a young age, and at the age of thirteen, I left primary school to become an apprentice. I took advantage of my spare time after work to attend supplementary schools to pursue further education. Later, I made some progress in the business world. Reflecting on the pain of being out of school, I decided to extend this feeling to others, so twenty-five years ago, I founded two commercial supplementary schools on Henan Road. More than ten years later, I also established six free schools in the suburbs of Shanghai. Among them, there are many who have completed their studies and gone out to serve society.</p>
<p>Now, the Shen Bao readers have initiated a scholarship fund to benefit out-of-school youth, which is truly significant. Today's industrial and commercial employees are the cornerstone of tomorrow's economy. Among them are many people with good education, but due to financial difficulties and limited monthly income, they are unable to pursue further education in their spare time. In addition to the large, medium, and small groups, the Shen Bao has added an industrial and commercial employee group, hoping to enable shop assistants and apprentices to fulfill their desire to study in their spare time.</p>
<p>However, the recipients themselves should thoroughly examine themselves. The gathering of scholarship funds is based on compassion and has the value of encouraging hardship and cultivating talent for society. The selected students should not regard this assistance as a solution to temporary financial difficulties, but as a supreme honor. The most valuable experiences in our lives are none other than being helped by others, helping ourselves, and helping others. Now that the students have been helped by others, they should cultivate their character, encourage their studies, strive for a better future, and seek ways to help themselves. If they have enough to spare, they should help others. The students who receive help from society today will repay society a hundredfold in the future. I sincerely hope that the Shen Bao scholarship fund will be a guide for their ambition. (Huang Youdao)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Survival and Life <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaolin</p>
<p>Survival is a human right, so everyone should develop themselves in different ways. With rights come obligations. When fulfilling this obligation to survive, it is necessary to acknowledge the right of others to survive. You do not have the privilege to replace others in developing their survival, nor should you allow others to survive in your place.</p>
<p>The purpose of life is to change life. Life is constantly improving, and the world is constantly changing. These two improvements are in the same direction. Do not be afraid of change. You should improve with the world to a better state.</p>
<p>Life is a necessary condition for survival. The more difficult life is, the stronger survival becomes. Strong survival must closely follow the current state of the world, making oneself a part of the world. Although the strength is small, if every part can be strong, wouldn't the world be more stable?</p>
<h3 id="e77">After Determination <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Shuo</p>
<p>"Determination" is indeed necessary for every successful person, but the most important thing is what should be done "after determination"?</p>
<p>After making a determination, of course, you have to put it into practice. If determination and practice are like a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law, afraid to meet each other, then even if the determination is fantastically eloquent and impressive, "only the sound of footsteps on the stairs is heard, but no one comes down," it's like a fool's dream, deceiving yourself, pointlessly bickering with yourself, and also making onlookers who hear your firm determination stretch their necks and wait foolishly. If it happens again and again, it may cause you to lose your self-esteem and credibility from now on. So I say, "If you don't have full confidence, it's better not to make a determination. Once you've made a determination, you have to work hard to do it."</p>
<p>Among fashionable people nowadays, making determinations has become commonplace. After being stimulated, a determination immediately follows. The table is slammed loudly, and the language is like a hero going to his death, filling the eyebrows with heroic spirit. It seems that if they don't do it, they can't go on. But when the anger subsides, the determination deflates like a rubber bubble, and in a moment they're back to their dull faces.</p>
<p>If everyone could put their determinations into practice, then the world wouldn't be so bad, and people wouldn't be so miserable.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Diligent Study: Is to · Repay · Kindness. A Primary School Student <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>My father is far away in Calcutta. Since my relatives remitted a sum of money last spring, it was used up in a few months due to the high cost of living. Honestly, it is embarrassing for a family like ours to apply for a scholarship. However, if it weren't for your esteemed organization's help last summer and winter, I really wouldn't have known where to get the tuition fees for my fifth grade of primary school.</p>
<p>When my mother was tutoring me by lamplight, she repeatedly urged me to study hard, saying that only by working hard can I repay the kindness of your newspaper. I keep it in mind at all times. I read the newspaper in my spare time and learned that the fourth scholarship fund will start again. I am very happy and wrote these few sentences. If my father ever comes back, I don't know how happy he will be! (My grades this semester are all above 80 points, and I am reporting this.)</p>
<p>The Whole City Unites to Help Students</p>
<p>Nurturing Talents is Benefiting Society</p>
<h3 id="e79">A Perspective on the Family Circumstances of Impoverished Students: Reflecting the Situation of All Levels from Statistics <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The fourth scholarship fund began to be processed on the fifteenth. My colleagues look back on the past, ashamed of the limited efforts we have made. Looking forward to the future, we feel even more responsible. In addition to the income and expenditure of the three scholarship funds and the number of recipients, which are reported separately, we now record several statistical items to show the urgency of scholarship matters, hoping that all sectors will continue to donate generously, so that the statistics of this limited number can be gradually expanded. It is not only the good fortune of impoverished students, but also the blessing of society.</p>
<p>Student Gender</p>
<p>A. In the three scholarship funds, there were 2,412 male students, accounting for 76.4%, and 742 female students, accounting for 23.6%.</p>
<p>Parents' Occupation</p>
<p>B. Among the occupations of students' parents, the labor sector accounted for the most, at 33%, followed by unemployment at 15%, deceased at 13%, the education sector at 10%, orphans at 3%, family scattered at 1.6%, and the political sector at 0.4%, and peddlers at 1.4%. In addition, lawyers, pastors, engineers, soldiers, police, and servants each accounted for a small portion.</p>
<p>Average Income</p>
<p>C. According to the statistics of the third session, 25% of students' parents had no income, and the average monthly income was 163 yuan.</p>
<p>Family Size</p>
<p>D. The average number of people in each applicant student's family is 5.5, with some families having as many as 15 members.</p>
<p>Age Statistics</p>
<p>E. The age statistics of the third session of students range from 9 to 29 years old, with the majority being 14 and 15 years old.</p>
<p>Residential Area</p>
<p>F. Among the students applying for scholarship funds, the most lived in the western district of the concession, followed by the western district of the French Concession, the central district of the Public Concession, the eastern district of the French Concession, the Fahua district, the Zhabei district, the Hubei district, and the Hongkou district, in decreasing order. The Pudong district had the fewest.</p>
<p>Sharply Increased Tuition Fees</p>
<p>G. Since the three sessions, average tuition fees have increased several times. In the first session, the average tuition fee for the university group was 111.50 yuan, while in the third session, it averaged 235 yuan. The average tuition fee for middle school in the first session was 62 yuan, and in the third session, it averaged 140 yuan. The average tuition fee for primary school in the first session was 33 yuan, while in the third session, it averaged 70 yuan.</p>
<p>After reading the above brief description of the numbers, we deeply feel that there is no need to add any more words. Anyone who is enthusiastic about social welfare will regard this as nothing less than the blood and tears history of impoverished students. Who doesn't have children? How can we bear to let these students unfortunately drop out of school?</p>
