<p>社評</p>
<h3>國民戰時生活的實踐途徑</h3>
<p>國際戰爭之長期化，及戰爭實况之日趨激烈，已經是顯著的趨勢了。爲着完遂戰爭目的建設新秩序，軸心各國，莫不認淸這種嚴重的現實與趨勢，亟圓集結全國所有一切力量，提供給政府，提供給戰爭。在這種重大的意義之下，全體國民，都爲對國家對民族對戰爭所負的責任感與義務感所控制，不再顧到私人的生活與享受了。隨着戰局的推移，凡是要在最後的決戰中爭取勝利的，就不得不更大限度地克制私人生活。移其一切力量以應戰爭的需要。他們的私生活愈刻苦，愈節約，他們的國家便愈充實，戰力便愈堅强，因而，他們自己就感到對國家民族之盡責，而有無限的愉快與光榮。</p>
<p>我們中國自參戰以來，諸如租界之接收，治外法權之撤廢等等，已經先受了參戰的實惠，然而，我們對於戰爭究竟盡了幾分責任？固然，這是政府的任務，與一般人民無與，說這種話的人不見得少，然而，從社會的現實來觀察，一般國民生活，毫無戰時景象，就使不說對戰爭的義務，只從國家及民族前途着想，也不能不引起我們的憂慮。試讀日本高田與戶田二博士「戰時國民生活要諦」一文，（見今日本報）我們將作何感想？</p>
<p>戰時生活之要義，是减低國民小我生活之享受，以增益國家大我之實力，增强戰鬥實力，爭取勝利，以保障國民將來的生活與享受。所以，戰時生活，主要的是節約。我們曾經不斷地把這個問題向社會提出過，而本市新聞聯合會，特別舉行節約宣傅週，以普遍喚起國人的注意。現在，無論如何，應該由言論而到實踐的時候了。</p>
<p>我們所說的戰時生活，所說的節約，不外乎從國民日常生活衣食住行方面入手。我們要求一方面保障一般市民的最低限度的生活，一方面節制少數人過分的浪費。爲着保障最低限度的生活，食糧的配給制，還應求其普遍與改善，增加配給戶口米粉的次數和數量，而且，耍儘可能的做到不脫期，決不減量減質；爲着節制浪費，就必須認眞禁止一切不正當娛樂，同時限制一切非生產的商業。我們要重複指出·如果不給市民以最低生活的保障，則人民對政府對國策之了解與擁護的程度，不會深刻與熱烈的！那麼，任何節約運動也不免落空了。</p>
<p>目前的事實，大多數國民的生活，一般的說，是很困苦了，簡直不忍說再要他們節約。但是，同時社會上也有一輩投機囤積的暴利者，他們的人數也不少，他們是破壞國民戰時刻苦生活的眞正的罪人，社會上違反戰時生活的現象，都因他們而造成；社會上一切不平與不安，以及國民經濟的危機，也是由他們的影饗所醞釀成的。例如飲食，日木戶田氏所指出的，日本愛媛和高知縣濱海之地，峻嶺深谷間只出白薯和海裏的沙丁魚，但那裏的居民都很壯健，爲日本第一的兵源區。相反的，如東京等美食的市民，大都體質不健實，可見日食珍饈，無補於身。從此節約浮費，於國於己，兩有裨益。此外如衣，如住，如行，事實上鄉村人民，向習於質樸簡單，都很壯健有力，城市人民，適得其反，享受愈高，則體格愈衰，這是天演的公例</p>
<p>我們今日希望在上者以身作則，來做一般國民的模範，而本市市商會，市民福利協會，工商聯誼會，銀行公會及其他諸民間有力的團體，更應該立即聯合推動各界，勵行節約。同時，在積極方面，我們還希望在上海等大都市，實行更切實的人口疏散，凡是無留居大城市必要的，凡是農村子弟，都應勸導並協助　歸農，另一方面，由各地當局在土地，種籽等給與協助，金融界更宜推廣眞正的農貸。這樣，一方面可以減少都市經濟危機，一方面可以復興農村增進生產，國民戰時半活之實踐，才有更大的成效可收。對於國家民族及對友邦協力，才有實際的意義，盼望各界共同研究，協力促其實現。</p>

<h3>中樞對林森不予追悼</h3>

<h3>孟達上空發生劇烈空戰　美軍森林作戰困苦</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電日大本營木日下午三時三十分發表，帝國海軍八月四日在孟達上空與敵戰鬥機七十架交戰，擊落其二十五架，我方損失四架。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城五日中央社電　新佐冶亞島孟達方面之陸戰，因日守備隊勇猛善戰，美軍企圖之登陸作戰，終遲　未能前進，人物損失均極重大。頃據新金山來電，西南太平洋反軸心軍人三日會日記者團時稱，美軍現正與日軍激戰，日守備隊雖經美陸海空軍三方面猛攻，然仍毫無衰退。又美聯社及泰晤士報前綫特派員亦稱，美軍於七月二十五日在孟達方面開始總攻，迄今寸日間，殆毫無進展，日守備隊現止阻止美軍前進、誓死抵抗。繼就美軍之森林苦戰情形報道稱，森林作戰之困雖，實出美軍理想之外云。</p>
<h3>奧勒爾德軍作戰略上撤退　密烏斯德軍反攻獲　勝蘇軍一萬八千人被俘</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電據海通社訊，軍界稱：德軍於八月四日晚已自奧勒爾撤退，但此實爲德軍預定計劃，故作有準備之撤退。五日前德軍已將該地區設施加以破毀，德人民亦伴同德軍西栘，然德軍自奧勒爾撤退，實不能認蘇軍達到其目的，蓋彼軍已爲最後之英勇作戰，完成軍事要求也。</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電密烏斯前綫之德軍作戰，就現已查明之戰果而觀，可謂已獲成功，據元首大本營四日正午發表之公報，蘇軍被俘總數約有一萬八千人，此正足以證明德軍反攻之熾烈。據德軍當局估計，蘇軍至少已喪失狙擊兵五六師團，蘇軍爲　恢復在密烏斯戰綫所受之重大損害，曾於三日在唐納資戰綫亦曾努力反攻，自伊齊姆橋頭堡出動狙擊兵六師戰車六十輛，迫攻德軍陣到，並突入一地點，但德軍與之展開白刃戰後，即阻止蘇軍突進，同時德軍並猛烈反攻，擊毀蘇軍戰車二十四輛，蘇軍之攻勢至此乃完全失收。</p>

<p>柏林五日中央社電德國權威方面人士今日證實德軍退出喀太尼亞，德軍在該區之戰略，係在西西里烏之戰事行動之最成功之一。據稱，德軍久已在喀太尼亞區僅備有薄弱之戰綫，駐於該處之德軍之工作　係愚弄敵軍使彼等雖有强大之戰鬥力，亦不敢有所行動。故喀太尼亞後方新戰綫已由極爲堅强之軍隊駐守，反軸心軍在該處必須再更遭受艱難之戰爭也。</p>

<h3>戰時國民生活要諦（一）</h3>
<p>高田保馬博士戶田正三博士對談</p>
<p>現在南方戰綫的情况，愈演愈烈，今後必更趨嚴電，我們國民應該咬定牙關爭取最後的勝利。雖說我們實際上已在實行着刻苦的生活，可是一般國民，都認爲祗因在戰爭時期中，才不能不忍受一切。抱着道樣最消極的態度者，恐怕也未必沒有吧。這種態度是未便贊同的，要到這無論在戰時，或平時，倘不能實行最低生活，國家便會　於衰亡，若要期待民族永遠的繁榮，就得像古來歷史所昭示的一樣，非絕對實行耐苦生活不可。這種積極的辦法，才是國民的信念，和應有的美德。那時候，非但大東亞戰爭能獲必勝，並且日本民族，也可得到永遠堅穩的形勢了。這刻苦生活，可說是我們國民對於國家的義務，也就是對國家的服役，所以　明瞭刻苦生活的道理，和那具體的實行方法，確是當務之急。因此，我們特意懇求提倡者民族研究所所長高田博士，和對於設計方而造詣宏富的京都帝大醫學部敎授戶田博士，討論這個問題，以便國民對此能有透澈的瞭解。</p>
<p>富豪無後——最低生活是國家繁榮的基礎</p>
<p>高田：我從來不曾打算發表什麼特別稀奇的議論，不過這也得有個前提：究竟應以個人生沽爲主呢？還足應以國家或民族爲主呢？這前提所得出的結　便可任意活動了，個人生活非盡量提高不可，這種思想，確已支配着一般人心許久了。不錯的，要想以個人生活爲全，那麼，榮　惟恐不足，調護也惟恐不周，興趣和敎養又要想极力設法提高，人類的這種欲望，是常然的。可是在國家或民族上着想，萬萬辦不通的。與技術發達，財富達到最高峰的英美互相競爭着，要想使國家獨立，民族發展，不能不使用全部的力量，所以我們不能不抑止對於個人的享樂，或生活的捉高，一方並設法增加人口。這不僅是爲了這幾年來的戰爭起見。爲着民族永遠的繁榮計，也是必要的。文化能夠提高，好活能夠安定，這自然是生現象，但因此人們從生活中喪失了野性，對於競爭和戰鬥，慢慢地只有增加不利的情勢。那最大原因，便是减少了人口的增加率吧！</p>
<p>戶田：你說的理的原因與人爲的原因二大區別。在生理方面說來、提高個人生活那就是專過那會生活，進而喜歡過着富豪生活，於是人口因此减少，尤其是不能產生男兒，所謂富　絕後，已經成爲確切不移的原理。什麼綠故呢，人類從幾百萬年前，以至今日，在這悠久的時期中，並沒有發生任何變化，這是大家都知道的。那麼這幾十萬年來，是怎樣生活過來的呢，說來也很簡單，原來地球上最容易得到的是物實，例如在南方，人們可以耕種穀來，北方可以耕植小麥成薯類。用作食　以生活，再說凡　動物性如牛羊，或魚類，也都自然地儘量增產勢力繁殖起來，以求繁衍自己種族的生命，但現在我來看　會生活，或富豪的生活時，簡直和這幾十萬年的生活完全相反。自身所欲獲得的自然的東西，全然不加努力，然而　求不獲而勞，　　他人所獲得的東西以自供，却費了不少的力量，　　權的行為，老早不是人類木來的生活了。因爲人類之所以生存迄今者，由於合乎自然的生活所致。凡與自然相反的生活、在這個世界上，當然是在淘汰之例了。高田：</p>
<p>據歐洲的統計看來，貴族的家族系統、斷絕得很快，從悠久的歷史上觀察起來，一國之內，所有高等階級的人們，都是自然滅亡，而低級的人們，便來補充這個抉陷。成爲一種循環狀態。並且在都市與農村，國家與國家，民族與民族的關係上，似乎也有這種循環狀熊。</p>
<p>戶田：鄙人對於這事，正在發動着一種有趣的實騐。雖　現在還沒有達刋發表的程度，其大概是這樣：養雞從難難時期起，完全在同等條件之下飼養起來，雖說在完全局等條件之下，但有一點不同，把一　雞放在空氣　通的房屋　　着，另一　雞卻放在毫不通氣的房屋裏　着，於是再來調查那發育狀態，便知道空氣流通方面的難雛，如果是雌雞，那麼普通一隻可生蛋二百五三百個，那不通氣的房屋所侵的雌難，無論配合若干雄雞，而難蛋的　化率便要大减。維難著在不通氣的狀態下　着，牲的子孫發展力量也是極其薄弱的。</p>
<p>高田：不錯。這是很有趣味的實騐。舊式閨女的養育方決，可見得是絕對不行的，</p>
<p>戶田：是的，違背自然，常然不可、在職業上，如果農民也肯實行你所主張的刻苦生活，就可生育很多的孩子，德川時代，農村人口非常增加，但是那時的總人口，並不曾冬了若干、因爲那時家裏有人滿爲患的，都有殺子的惡習、假如沒有這殺子的惡習，那農村的入口，不知道要怎樣繁　呢，可是德川時代，江戶百萬人口，一個也沒有增加，所謂貴族家統不過三代，便要完全滅亡、大阪船塲方而也有這樣的情形，都把別人耕種的東四，加以整理，而類之生活。　而言之，是缺乏自己開拓的原動力，男兒本來是保持着這種動力的、因爲不需要男孩子，便把這種原動力奪去鎭在深　養育着，因而便不能養育成人。因此，都會　、或富豪的家裏，不能產生男兒縱使產生了、也撫簽不成。這是自然的道現。</p>
<p>考察巴比倫或　馬，又如今日的倫敦、巴黎，紐約，等，紐約的歷史雖淺，然也可見到同樣悄事，因爲這是眞理！（新：　自東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>葉公用局長廣播演詞</h3>
<p>市宣傳處爲慶祝收囘租界舉行長期廣播，昨晚由公用局長兼雪松擔任，題爲「上海租界收囘後對市民希望」，節錄演辭如後：</p>
<p>目前大東亞戰爭正在進行而上海自租界收同以後，行政上自然需要一元化，以適應　時體制。我們希望上海出界收囘以後，上海成爲中國政治的模範區城。上海的市民，應一掃過去無國家的觀念，切實服從政令，推行國策，然後中國的復與，才可成功，這是兄弟對上海市民的希望第一點。</p>
<p>上海素爲中國的經濟中心，今後上海應該成爲中國的產業中心、對於一切消費的場所，畸形的繁榮，必須予以嚴格限制，以省物力。對於一切生產事業，必須努力輔助，使之發展，我們希望於上海市民努力於節省消費，增加生產，絕對糾正一種祗圖私利，不爲國家服役的錯誤觀念。我們希望每一個市民、要凜遵主席「貢獻要多，享受要少」的訓示，一致爲國家服役，這是兄弟對於上海市民希望的第二點。</p>
<p>上海向稱文化的中心，然而事變以來，社會敎靑是不斷退步，文化事業，是非常凋零。我們希望租界收囘以後，政府與人民一致努力於撲滅羅惡的根源。發揚文化。務使上海不失爲文化中心的美　，成爲東亞文化溝通的中心，還是希望於市民的第三點。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>澈底消滅黑市</h3>
<p>普還的消費配給，始足封　商人攫取非法利潤的途徑。昨論「火柴按戶配給」時、業經說過。同時，這樣一個論調，也是爲着捲烟黑市而發的。因爲，配給不周，或是難有配給而得不到配給，則有黑市之產生；米，糖，鹽，油的黑市，可以推而至於任何一種物品的黑市。</p>
<p>以捲烟黑市而論，如今華中烟草配給組合亦已察覺到實際消費者所得到的，不是烟紙店中所配給的限價捲烟，而是影院門前以及街顫巷尾所韓販的高價捲烟。這些高價捲烟，高出限價輒至二三倍以上，是販戶的利益呢？還是小賣商店的共同利益呢？我們不得而知，總之，實際消費者增加了幾重負担了。</p>
<p>該組合爲澈底消滅黑市起見，昨特公告「所有配給捲烟空壳，自即日起，慨須收囘」，這當然是嚴厲杜絕黑市的一個標準作風。還記得在前年十二月八日以後的香港，人人囤積罐頤食品，黑市猖獗，遂使當局不能不令商店出售罐頭咖啡奶粉，必須開聽，出售　頭魚肉蔬菓，必須撕去招牌紙，使共不能再入黑市。這在澈底消滅黑市方面，都是異曲同工之舉。</p>
<h3>銀聯會對同業拆放依照新規定辦理</h3>
<p>上海銀行聯合準備委備會結算一次。員會爲調　各行莊金融辦理同業拆放後，自八月起對每一同業拆放額，依照新規定辦理。同業拆放限於，　銀行業公會會員銀行，　錢業聯合準備庫轉拆給各莊，　準備會會員銀行交換銀行及往來銀行，與信託公司。每一同業拆借款項以二十萬元爲基數，準備會對每一同業拆放總數、以各該同業活期存款總數十分之二，加基數之合計數爲限。但每一同業活期存款總數超過三千萬元者，其超過部份之拆放額，應依十分之一計　，準備會對錢庫之拆放總數以五千萬元爲限。關於活期存款數應於每年一月四月七月十月，由準備會依前三個月月底各同業計算，應繳存款準備金時　所繳數字平均計算之。關於各行莊拆借所提供之財產以下列爲限，　政府證券，　華商股票及債票，　上海市區內之洧收益之房地產，　準備會公單公庫證，　立時可以在本巾變賣之貨物，其所有人係正當工商或廠商，所有目的非爲囤積圖利者爲限。每一行莊提供貨物，以總評價不超過準備會對各該行莊核定拆放總額百分之二十五爲限，拆放利率由準備曾參酌市面情形隨時訂定之，每屆月底由準備會結算一次。</p>
<h3>中儲調整各地匯水率</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行上海分行，近以內地分支行辦事處增設日多，金融網益見週密，因內地資金運用活潑，匯兌業務日呈蓬勃繁榮，爲便利商民及减輕匯款負担起見，特將各地匯水率重行調整，改訂如下：由上海匯往廣州每千元隨水（包括信匯票匯）二十元，電匯每筆八十元，厦門汕頭匯水每千元十五元，電匯八十元，漢口安慶九江南昌匯水每千元十元，電匯每筆五十元，靑波匯水每千元五元，電匯每筆五十元，南通匯水第千元三元，電匯每筆五十元，泰縣揚州匯水每千元一元五角，電匯五十元，南京杭州蚌埠鎭江蕪湖無鍚常州常熱匯水每千元一元，電匯每筆五十元，蘇州嘉興松江崑山太倉匯水每千元五角，電匯每筆五十元。凡信匯票匯每筆另加手續費二元，電匯另加手續費三元。</p>

<h3>物資審議會昨開會議</h3>

<h3>一區將澈查囤積五洋貨物</h3>
<p>租界收囘第一區區公署正式成立後，區署當局，對於所轄區內之一切　　活動，現正愼重研究對策中，頃悉區署當局，除在原則上繼續前工部局推行之政策嚴格執行商品限價，及取締投機囤積行爲外，其第一步之動作，爲　於近日來本市五洋貨品，如肥皂，蠟燭，火柴，捲烟，紙張等黑市貨賣，異常猖獗，不法商人，大量搜購囤積，致使日常必需品之價格，日夜飛漲，較一個月前幾及一倍，荼毒民生至深且鉅、故區署當局，決即採取前工部局澈查棉紗棉布之同樣措置，予以澈底之調查，無論商店個人有囤積五洋貨品之確實證據者旬決予嚴懲不貸云。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股曲折，又起變化，上午漲後稍回，頗臻穩定，午後又起劇漲，進價之高，甚出意外，新藥業之新亞　廠，午後昂　一二關尙難進得，五洲呆平，新星樂廠步升，越票面二倍半，中西，信誼均見挺升，佑寗藥廠做價亦高，科學化工升至票面一倍七。百貨業之永安公司本見上升，後更飛躍，軋升半百，新新及國貨反跌爲漲，下午已叩四關，中國內衣亦　至一二關外，在增資消息中搜求有人，景福衫　突升，景綸隨之盤上，麗安及光華百貨午後價均抬上。紡織業之永安紡織初見盤小至大關邊，下午忽飛上反軋升百數，美綸，綸華，國信，信和，振轉，　光，友生，同豐，公和等股亦轉疫爲堅，大中華織造又叩四關，宏甡亦出三關外，仁豐平。文化業商務與中華之買戶價一味拾見新高峰，世界略見低落，永祥四關外成交。南洋烟公司退入七關後亦回出，大中華火柴在四關左右，實業股最爲堅穩，久安於午後挺升尤銳，大中華與興華實業均在買勢中進展，新亞建業午後拽求更踴躍，疲而回升，中國與國華售戶日少，價堅逾恒，新益與聯華地產上升頗勁，標準味粉重越三關，吉美食品亦趨悄俐，康元製躍買風亦起，晉豐造紙，標準紙品，保安玻　，中興木業，德豐針織，大華蓄植均在求多供少狀况中堅定，上海三輪升近票面近倍，中國鐘廠微升，公用業閘北水電與華商電氣均平。</p>

<h3>創造我們的路</h3>
<p>— 聲泉</p>
<p>人生原是在走路：前進，後退，徘徊，彷徨……</p>
<p>平庸的人，只求一個子的路；一個子自生至死，怎樣去生存去享樂的路·偉大的人，他們要創造偉大的路·佼許多人平安地生存甚至於推動全世界的進步。凱末爾將軍造了路，使士耳其的民衆們，得到自由平等幸福，國父中山先生造了路，使黃帝的子孫　脫了帝劃的束縛。</p>
<p>本來，世界上也無所謂路的；人走得多了，才成了路，所以，路是人造成的。</p>
<p>許多人走上了絕路而不囘首，在那兒呻吟，甚至毀滅：許多人走上了大路，然而意志動搖，不能耐着疲勞艱苦，終於　了出來。</p>
<p>靑年們，看看前人的血跡，自己的創痕，　進自己走路的經騐，然後，用着　愼，勇敢而且鄭重的步伐，定上光購的大路，雖然，免不了是那麼的困苦艱難·創造新的或者完成前人未竟的道路。並且　沒那絕人的路，免得後人在那兒呻吟甚　毀滅，因爲我們已不認它也是一條路！</p>
<p>人生原是在　路，但是我們別忘了選擇路！</p>
<h3>發奮和苟安</h3>
<p>— 李湘</p>
<p>大概一個人，尤其是士大夫階級的，生活環境到了由窮水　，貧無立錐的時候，便知激發驚勵，到了安閒舒適，無憂無慮的時候，便　茍旦偷安了。這眞是「自古已然，於今爲烈」的普遍現象。</p>
<p>我們常常看見許多富　子弟，恃着先人的餘　，不事生產，不務正業，驕奢淫逸，自暴自棄，到後來坐吃山空時，窮途落泊，甚至淪爲盜賊，爲　社會的安寗，這種人，正如鄭板橋詩句所謂「可憐道上飢寒子，砟日華堂臥錦茵」所形容那些富貴子弟的流落情形，就是由於「舒則苟安」的結果。</p>
<p>再觀古時的有志之士，如取武子之映　讀書：　雙臣之　　勸學。蘇　的懸　剌股；百里奚，管　　以及歷史上由布衣而　王侯的人物，沒有一個不是生於憂患，死於安樂的。所謂「十年窗下無人問，一舉成名天下知」，一　之問，即變成頗據之士，榮歸故鄉，叶氣揚眉，這些人物，都是由於「窮則發奮」的結果。</p>
<p>過去的歷史陳迹，本來都是現實的最好教訓。須知「創業」固然維艱，但是「守成」也並不是　易辦得到的。芸芸衆生中，有幾許人又能逃避掉物　享樂的引誘呢？「發奮」和「苟安」，何去何從，完全憑着各個人理智的抉擇了。</p>
<h3>算命問卜</h3>
<p>— 授</p>
<p>人們在猶豫不決的時候，常常歐喜問卜，這倒不一定都是無智識的人所爲。即使是那些受過相當教育的人吧，年紀一過了四十，很多的會不知不　地對於星相術有點着迷起來，「算算命相相面害處　沒有啊！」這是他們對於問卜的解　。</p>
<p>也許有人會這樣的想：「無論如何，星相家的本領總有一點吧？」然而天知道，十個星相家倒　一大牛是瞎子，一個有眼睛能夠　得見這社會的人知反而去求敎那　暗巾摸索的瞎子，眞是天下奇談！他們的本領是什麼？有眼的星相家有着鑒貌辨色的眼睛和會寫不着邊際的批命的手；瞎眼的星相家有着細聆你說話的耳朶，善於　令的嘴巴，拆穿一句，大騙子而已。</p>
<p>可是在一些迷信星相術的人看來，星相家的說話都是金玉良會，他們的批句史是「指途南針」。偶有一二句這過去未來之言　了，便是星相家的神術，不中就是自己的運氣不　了，他們辦一件事的時候，不是　着轂力去幹，却是等待自己去韓入一步什麼「運」，到頭來一無所成，還是在那兒搖頭嘆息說這是命！</p>
<p>着迷的人們，醒醒吧，世界能夠主率你一生的人，便是你自個見！你要在這艱難的時代裏有所成就，只有打定你自已的意志，努力苦幹，並且記住你是命運的主人。</p>

<h3>請當局注意嚴重的囤屋問題</h3>
<p>— 方之</p>
<p>目前當局對於澈查囤貨，頗爲嚴厲，此誠新生上海市民之幸福，一般投機份子，乃異想天開，　集巨資，有計劃的改營囤屋買賣，或提前一次收足若干年房租，威脅房客出　，展轉出租，以岡漁利，如最近呂班路」　　坊之囤屋式買賣，即其著者。按　　坊房屋共百　原係法商建業地產公司產業，最近由該公司以二千二百餘萬元出售於　屋大集團「　　公司」，由　　公司分幢出售，每幢自四十餘萬起，至五六十萬不等，分函該坊住戶限在三天內簽約，當場先付定金三成，日後續付二成，其餘五成在兩月後付淸，惟須依照市息算給，逾期即不保留等情，　　公司於一轉手　　，可獲利一千數百餘萬元之鉅，實屬不法已極。</p>
<p>値茲兩租界接收伊始，人民正渴望當局發揮其新的政續，開拓人民對政治的信仰，安能容此輩目無法紀之　儈，爲所欲爲，非特影響戰時後方居佳治安，更聲接威脅本市居民之居住負擔，此風一開，絞　思逞者，必踵起效尤，變本加厲，何堪設想。深信市府當局，於　定民食之餘，更注意於民生主義中知「住」的問題。對於此種囤屋奉利智集團，出以強有力的制裁。</p>
<h3>國際性慈善機關　鮑斯高慈幼會訪問記（一）　苦難兒童的救濟會　建設人才的訓練所</h3>
<p>上海最著名的工業區楊樹浦，最幽靜的文化區南市國貨路，和充滿田園風光的南翔與江灣，分佈着由義大利人創辦的斯高慈幼會的文化性的慈善事業，當大家的話題中活躍着「義大利」三字之時，我們特別去拜訪這些義大利人在華創辦的事業介紹於國人之前，應該是最有意義的事罷。</p>
<p>十九世紀的偉人—鮑斯高</p>
<p>現在上海主持着悉幼會一部份事業的歐彌額紳父很興奮地們的事業，首先特別提出天主敎慈幼會之首創者聖若望鮑斯高神父的神奇的歷史。這位鮑聖，在國際間流傳着關於他的　　着趣味與智慧的故事和傳記，義大利名作家Ruffino　Uguccioni的Un　Grande　Italiano更為各國爭着翻譯，中文本有香港聖類思工藝學校出版的「十九世紀的偉人」，生動地描寫這位「以貧救貧」的鮑聖的一生。他於一八一五年誕生於多利諾城附近碧基鄕，一間環堵蕭然的蓬戶　，兩歲時就沒了父親，依賴年僅二十七歲的寡母鞠育。由於貧困，更由於慈母的善導，他從小就很聰敏，對於貧苦兒童生活，就希望奮起改善。自己衣食不足，當然更讀不起書，只得向跑江湖的學些技藝，小小年紀，就揮淚離家，自謀生計。因為天機靈活，特詣極深，對兒童力與號召。但直到十三歲，還沒有進學校，只在私人處，一面做僮僕，一面學習。到了二十歲才進修道院就學。同時，他對於改善里巷貧苦及隨落少年生活的仁慈也進而實踐。他第一步工作是弄到一所空屋，收容無衣無食無家可歸的兒童，敎他們一些學熾和小工藝技術，使在極短期內，不能自食其力。一時風傳，不久就收容到三百餘人。然而，一方面粥少人多，不能不另圖別居，另一方面，因為兒童喧嘈，鄰居厭慊，致受當局驅農，幾經波瀾，終被克服困難。後來居然興辦起貧民學校等規模較大的慈善機關，募款籌糧敎育苦兒，幾乎耗去他全部的時間。從一八四一年起，他就在義大利各工業區業辦Salesiano慈幼會學校，專收貧苦失學兒童，予以普通和工藝敎育，後來更逐漸國外舉辦，而鮑斯高慈幼會之名，就喧傳於世界各地，一八六一年起，更為救助貧苦的女童而創辦母佑會（無原罪聖母會）與慈幼會配合成為敎養貧苦男女兒童的國際慈善機關。他雖巳七雨同年，但是仍為這一事業而奔走異邦，直到一八八年才卷敎士現在巳達數千，工事業巳迥及五大洲，成千成萬的慈幼會修士和母佑會修女在繼承他的偉大工作。</p>

<p>物價飛漲，生活高昂，復値炎署，貧病交迫者日多，同時向本處申請救濟者亦日衆。惟本處因過去致力於推動華北眼災及助學金，故各項助金祗有支出而無收入茲賬災助學粗告段落，鑒於貧病者袞鳴無告，於心何忍，亟盼熱心善士速解仁囊，繼　捐助。茲將上月分收支報告如下：</p>

<h3>潮汕救災會將舉辦書畫義展</h3>
<p>潮汕旅滬同鄉自發動賑濟潮汕募捐以來：蒙海上名流之贊助，各界人士之慷慨捐輸，成績頗爲可觀。惟因潮汕災區孤　海隅；交通隔閡，至今尙未爲社會所深切注視，故該會特發起舉辦書畫義展，一則以喚起各界人士之注，一間環堵簫然的蓬戶　，兩歲時就沒了父親，依　年僅二十七歲的寡母鞠育。由於貧困，更由於慈母的善導，他從小就很聰敏，對於貧苦兒童生活，就希望奮起改善。自己衣食不足，當然更　不起書，只得向跑江湖的學些技藝，小小年紀，就揮淚離家，自謀生計。因爲天機靈活，特別在幻術和戲劇方面，造詣極深，對兒童和成人，都有極大的吸引力與號召。但聲到十三歲，還沒有進學校，只在私人處，一而做僮僕，一面學習。到了二寸歲才進修道院就學。同時，他對於改善果巷貧苦及墮落少年生活的仁慈也進而實踐。他第一步工作是弄到一所空屋，收容無衣無食無家可歸的兒童，敎他們一些學　和小工藝技術，使在極短期內，就能自食其力。一時風傳，不久就收容到三百餘人。然而，一方面粥少人多，不能不另圖別居，另一方面，因爲兒童　　，鄰居厭　，致受爲局　逐，幾經波瀾，終被克服困難。後來居然興辦起貧民學校等規模較大的慈善機關，募款　糧敎育苦兒，幾乎耗去他全部的時間。從一八四一年起，他就在義大利各工業區舉辦Salesiano慈幼會學校，專收貧苦失學兒童，予以普通和工藝教育，後來更逐漸國外舉辦，而鮑斯高慈幼會之名，就喧傳於世界各地，一八六一年起，更爲救助貧苦的女童而創辦母佑會（無原罪聖母會）與慈幼會配合成爲敎養貧苦男女兒童的國際慈善機關。他雖巳七十高年，但是仍爲這一事業而奔走異邦，聲到一八八年才在舉世痛悼中歸天。然而，他已留下千古不朽的事業，他的傳教士現在已達數千，共事業已遍及五大洲，成千成萬的慈幼會修士和母佑會修女在　承他的偉大工作。意，一則藉以作較普遍之捐募。日昨該會來函託本報代爲廣筞名　，本報以華北華雨同屬同胞救災恤難，應不分畛域，允將此次華北急賬義展、所存各件，撥交該會義　；款充潮汕急　藉副捐贈本報諸君爲善最樂之至意，聞該曾已定於本月十五日起，假座　波同鄉會舉行，盼海內熱心人士以救濟華北之精神，子華南以踴躍之輸將</p>

<h3>Practical Ways to Live a Wartime Life for Citizens</h3>
<p>The prolongation of the international war and the increasingly fierce reality of the war are already obvious trends. In order to complete the war objectives and build a new order, the Axis countries all recognize this serious reality and trend. They are eager to gather all the strength of the country and provide it to the government and the war. Under this important significance, all citizens are controlled by a sense of responsibility and obligation to the country, the nation, and the war, and no longer care about personal life and enjoyment. With the development of the war situation, anyone who wants to win in the final decisive battle must restrain personal life to a greater extent and shift all its strength to meet the needs of the war. The more arduous and frugal their private lives are, the more prosperous their country will be and the stronger their combat power will be. Therefore, they themselves feel that they have fulfilled their responsibilities to the country and the nation, and they have infinite joy and glory.</p>
<p>Since our China joined the war, we have already received the benefits of participating in the war, such as the acceptance of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. However, how much responsibility have we fulfilled for the war? Of course, this is the task of the government and has nothing to do with the general public. There are not few people who say this. However, observing from the reality of society, the lives of the general public do not have any wartime scene. Even if we do not talk about the obligation to the war, only considering the future of the country and the nation, we cannot help but worry. Try reading the article "Essentials of Wartime National Life" by Japanese doctors Takada and Toda (see today's newspaper). What will we think?</p>
<p>The essence of wartime life is to reduce the enjoyment of the individual lives of the people to increase the strength of the nation, enhance combat strength, strive for victory, and protect the future life and enjoyment of the people. Therefore, the main thing in wartime life is thrift. We have repeatedly raised this issue to society, and the Municipal News Federation has held a special thrift promotion week to awaken the attention of the people. Now, no matter what, it is time to move from words to deeds.</p>
<p>The wartime life we are talking about, the thrift we are talking about, is nothing more than starting from the aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation in the daily life of the people. We demand that on the one hand, we guarantee the minimum living standards of the general public, and on the other hand, we control the excessive waste of a few people. In order to guarantee the minimum living standards, the food rationing system should be made more universal and improved, increasing the number and quantity of rice flour allocated to households. Moreover, it must be done as far as possible without delay, and never reducing the quantity or quality. In order to control waste, it is necessary to seriously prohibit all improper entertainment and restrict all non-productive businesses. We want to reiterate that if the people are not given the guarantee of a minimum living standard, then the degree of understanding and support of the people for the government and national policies will not be deep and enthusiastic! Then, any thrift movement will inevitably fail.</p>
<p>The current fact is that the lives of most people are generally very difficult. It is unbearable to say that they should be thrifty again. However, at the same time, there is also a generation of profiteers who speculate and hoard goods in society. They are not small in number. They are the real culprits who undermine the arduous life of the people in wartime. The phenomena in society that violate wartime life are all caused by them. All the injustice and unrest in society, as well as the crisis in the national economy, are also brewed by their influence. For example, in terms of diet, as Mr. Toda pointed out in Japan, in the coastal areas of Ehime and Kochi prefectures in Japan, only sweet potatoes and sardines from the sea are produced in the deep valleys of the mountains, but the residents there are very strong and are the first source of soldiers in Japan. On the contrary, citizens in Tokyo and other food-loving cities are mostly unhealthy. It can be seen that eating delicacies every day does not help the body. From this, saving extravagance is beneficial to both the country and oneself. In addition, such as clothing, housing, and transportation, in fact, the rural people have always been accustomed to simplicity and simplicity, and they are very strong and powerful. The urban people are just the opposite. The higher the enjoyment, the more their physique declines. This is the general rule of natural evolution.</p>
<p>Today, we hope that those in power will set an example to be a model for the general public, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Welfare Association, the Industry and Commerce Association, the Bankers' Association, and other powerful civil groups in this city should immediately jointly promote all sectors of society to practice thrift. At the same time, on the active side, we also hope to implement a more practical population evacuation in large cities such as Shanghai. All those who do not need to stay in large cities, all those who are rural children, should be advised and assisted to return to farming. On the other hand, the local authorities should provide assistance in land, seeds, etc., and the financial sector should promote genuine agricultural loans. In this way, on the one hand, it can reduce the urban economic crisis, and on the other hand, it can revive the countryside and increase production. The practice of the wartime life of the people can have greater results. It has practical significance for the country, the nation, and the cooperation with friendly countries. We hope that all sectors will jointly study and cooperate to promote its realization.</p>

<p>Ambassador's Eulogy</p>
<p>Your Excellency Chairman: This ambassador, by order of the head of state of my country, is stationed in your esteemed country. It is a great honor to present the Letter of Credence in the name of the specially appointed and fully empowered ambassador of Greater Germany. Since the National Government of the Republic of China joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, determined to jointly resist Bolshevism, and then declared war on the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the United States of America, the Republic of China has also joined the Three-Power Pact countries in the same war. The purpose and the result we want to obtain is only a complete victory over the enemy, so as to complete the new order between the nations we have created, and to make the original friendship between China and Germany closer. This ambassador takes the promotion of friendly relations as the most important task. I dare to ask your Excellency Chairman and the government of your country to continue to assist the previous ambassador and give him assistance. This ambassador hereby sincerely wishes your Excellency Chairman good health and prosperity to your country.</p>
<p>Chairman's Reply</p>
<p>Your Excellency Ambassador: Your Excellency Ambassador, by order of His Excellency Head of State Hitler of your country, is stationed in the Republic of China and presented the Letter of Credence as the specially appointed and fully empowered ambassador of Greater Germany. I am deeply honored to accept it. Under the leadership of His Excellency Head of State Hitler, your country is fighting for justice and peace, giving our common enemy the greatest blow. I express my infinite respect for the bravery and perseverance of your country's soldiers. After the Republic of China joined the Anti-Comintern Pact on November 25, 30, it resolutely declared war on British and American imperialism on January 9, 32, which is a firm expression of cooperation to subdue our enemies. All of our comrades in arms have the same purpose and belief, that is, to defeat the common enemy, so as to complete the new order between the nations, so that the final common victory must be successful. The friendly relations between our two countries have always been close. Your Excellency Former Ambassador Stamer and Minister Guo De have made great contributions to the promotion of the original friendly relations between you and me, and have successfully completed the glorious mission. I am convinced that Your Excellency Ambassador will make the relations between you and me closer. I and the government of this country will wholeheartedly assist you with the convenience required for the duties of Your Excellency Ambassador, so that the noble mission of Your Excellency Ambassador can be completed. I respectfully ask Your Excellency Ambassador to convey my regards to His Excellency Head of State Hitler, and wish your country prosperity.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Chu's speech</p>
<p>Your Excellency Ambassador: Your Excellency Ambassador, by order of His Excellency Head of State Hitler of your country, is the specially appointed and fully empowered ambassador to the Republic of China. This morning, you met with Chairman and presented your credentials. I am here on behalf of the government of this country to hold a banquet to show our welcome, and especially to take this opportunity to introduce the heads of the ministries and committees of the National Government and my colleagues to meet with you. I am very happy to be here. Your country is an advanced country in Europe, and its science and civilization are admired by the world. Since your head of state has been in power, he has built up the army, reformed politics, and restored the glory of the past. The European war has broken out and has lasted for four years. During this period, your country has endured hardship, persevered, and bravely fought for peace and justice, giving a great blow to our common enemy. I express my sincere admiration and respect. After the National Government established its capital, your country gladly recognized the government of this country and repeatedly sent Ambassador Stamer to station in this country. Ambassador Stamer was outstanding in his talent and knowledge. In the past, he worked hard on the anti-communist front and made great contributions to the success of the Three-Power Alliance. The cornerstone of world peace was thus established. When he was transferred to Tokyo, he was succeeded by Minister Guo De, who fulfilled his duties and completed his glorious mission during his tenure. Now that Your Excellency is coming to China and taking the post of Ambassador to China, you have gone through many hardships on the way. I am convinced that with Your Excellency's profound knowledge and rich experience, you will have more opportunities to promote the inherent harmony and friendship between our two countries after taking office. Now that this country is in the midst of an austerity movement, I apologize for the inadequate treatment of Your Excellency. I also ask for your forgiveness. As for all the conveniences required for Your Excellency's duties, I will certainly give my assistance so that Your Excellency can complete your lofty mission. I hereby raise my glass to wish His Excellency the Head of State of your country good health and prosperity to your country.</p>
<p>Ambassador Wei's reply</p>
<p>Your Excellency Minister: I would like to express my sincere gratitude for your kind words of welcome. Today, I am honored to present to Your Excellency Chairman the Letter of Credence by which the head of state of my country specially appointed me as the specially appointed and fully empowered ambassador to the National Government of the Republic of China. And I and my colleagues at the embassy are very happy to be the guests of Your Excellency Minister today and to be at the same table with the heads of government. I greatly appreciate Your Excellency Minister's friendly words to my country and my head of state. The friendship between China and Germany has a long history. Our cultural relations have also been around for many years. The Chinese people particularly admire the culture that China has contributed to the world. Our economic relations have always promoted mutual benefits. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, the Republic of China has joined its allies and is fighting against imperialism, and is also connected with the Three-Power Pact countries and other friendly nations. What must be mentioned at this time is that the friendly relations between our two countries have become more intense because your country joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. All our will and actions are focused on one goal, that is, victory. I would like to express my gratitude to Your Excellency Minister for the friendly words to the former Ambassador Stamer and Minister Guo De. I will do my best to promote the relationship between us, so I am very happy that the government of my country has heard that the government of your country shares this view and that Your Excellency Minister is willing to provide assistance, so that this ambassador can achieve his mission. I hereby take the host's glass of wine to wish Your Excellency Chairman good health, prosperity to your country, and good health to Your Excellency Minister.</p>
<h3>Central Government Did Not Offer Condolences to Lin Sen</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) After hearing the news of Lin Sen's death, the central government discussed it. Lin was elected as a Central Supervisory Committee member in the 13th year of the Republic of China and as the Chairman of the National Government in the 20th year. At the beginning of the return to the capital in March of the 29th year, he was originally asked to come to Nanjing to take office, but he delayed and did not do so. Until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although Lin's position was irresponsible for international politics, he was ultimately suspected of being hostile. Therefore, it was decided not to offer condolences.</p>
<h3>Fierce Air Battle Occurred Over Munda, U.S. Military Faced Difficult Forest Warfare</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM this afternoon that the Imperial Navy fought 70 enemy fighter planes over Munda on August 4, shooting down 25 of them. Our side lost 4 planes.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) Due to the fierce fighting of the Japanese garrison on the Munda area of New Georgia Island, the US military's attempt to land has been delayed and has not been able to advance. The losses of people and materials are very significant. According to a telegram from New Jinshan, the anti-Axis military personnel in the Southwest Pacific told a group of Japanese reporters on the 3rd that the US military is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. Although the Japanese garrison has been fiercely attacked by the US Army, Navy, and Air Force on three sides, it has not shown any signs of decline. The Associated Press and the frontline correspondents of the Times also stated that the US military began its general offensive in the Munda area on July 25, but has made almost no progress in the past few days. The Japanese garrison is now stopping the US military from advancing and resisting to the death. Then, the report described the difficult forest warfare situation of the US military, saying that the difficulty of forest warfare is beyond the imagination of the US military.</p>
<h3>German Troops in Orel Strategically Withdrew, German Counteroffensive in Mius Gained Victory, 18,000 Soviet Troops Captured</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) According to Huitong News Agency, military circles said that the German army had withdrawn from Orel on the evening of August 4, but this was actually a predetermined plan of the German army, so it withdrew with preparation. Five days ago, the German army had destroyed the facilities in the area, and the German people also accompanied the German army to the west. However, the German army's withdrawal from Orel cannot be considered that the Soviet army has achieved its goal, because their army has completed its military requirements for the final heroic battle.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) Judging from the battle results that have been clarified in the German military operations on the Mius front, it can be said that they have been successful. According to the communiqué issued by the Führer's headquarters at noon on the 4th, the total number of Soviet troops captured is about 18,000, which is enough to prove the ferocity of the German counteroffensive. According to estimates by the German military authorities, the Soviet army has lost at least five or six sniper divisions. In order to restore the heavy damage suffered on the Mius front, the Soviet army also tried to counterattack on the Donets front on the 3rd. Six divisions of snipers and 60 tanks were dispatched from the Izium bridgehead to force an attack on the German position and broke into one location, but the German army stopped the Soviet advance after engaging in a bayonet fight. At the same time, the German army also launched a fierce counteroffensive, destroying 24 Soviet tanks. The Soviet offensive was completely unsuccessful at this point.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Representatives of Various Countries Stationed in the Soviet Union Will Move Back to Moscow to Work</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) According to New York News: The diplomats of various countries in Kuibyshev are scheduled to return to Moscow within days. Currently, some diplomats have gathered in Moscow. Due to the increasing importance of the Eastern Front and the need to obtain war reports quickly, diplomatic officials urgently need to return to Moscow. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is already in Moscow. It is believed that after the diplomats of various countries arrive in Moscow, they will increase their activities.</p>
<h3>Axis Troops Withdraw from Catania in Sicily, Britain and the United States Compete for Political Leadership, Headquarters Moved to Malta</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) This official recently announced that the Axis troops have withdrawn from Catania.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) German authorities today confirmed that the German army has withdrawn from Catania. The German army's strategy in the area has been one of the most successful military actions in the Sicilian campaign. It is said that the German army has long been prepared with a weak line of defense in the Catania area. The work of the German army stationed there is to fool the enemy so that they dare not take any action even though they have strong combat power. Therefore, the new line of defense behind Catania has been guarded by extremely strong troops. The anti-Axis forces must suffer another difficult war in that area.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency) According to London News: Anti-Axis leaders in Sicily have disagreed over the leadership position on the island. The US attitude only allows Britain to assume military tasks on the island, while the administrative power in the occupied area must be taken over by the US. It is said that Eisenhower has severely criticized the British separatist movement in Sicily.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) According to news from the North African Anti-Axis Headquarters, the Anti-Axis forces are attacking Sicily, with Malta as General Eisenhower's operational headquarters. Eisenhower and his staff went to Malta four days before the scheduled start of the offensive. In addition to Eisenhower, those in Malta include Admiral Cunningham, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, General Alexander, Commander of the Tenth Army Corps, Air Force Commander Tedder, and Lieutenant General Montgomery, Commander of the British Eighth Army.</p>
<h3>Important Meeting Called by Italian Government; Ambroso Appointed Chief of General Staff</h3>
<p>Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Italian government will hold a meeting today to discuss important matters.</p>
<p>Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reported last night: King Victor Emmanuel III has appointed General Ambroso, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army, as Chief of the General Staff. Since Mussolini's resignation, all daily communiqués of the Italian Army have been signed by Ambroso. He has worked closely with the current Prime Minister, Marshal Badoglio, for seven years, especially during the Abyssinian War. Meanwhile, according to Stefani News Agency, Navy Minister Bertoletti and Air Force Minister Dari will be respectively appointed Chiefs of the Naval and Air Force General Staffs.</p>
<p>Confiscation of Property of Corrupt Officials</p>
<p>Weimar, 5th (Central News Agency) – Stefani News Agency reports: Italy has now established a special committee to investigate, based on reports from financial institutions, the increase in movable and immovable property of those who served as civil servants or participated in political activities between October 22, 1922, and July 24, 1943. Any property for which the source cannot be explained will be confiscated by the state. The chairman of the committee will be an official of the third rank or above, and the two members will be officials of the fourth rank or above. The committee may invite financial experts as consultants. Any transfer of property that should be confiscated after July 23, 1943, will be considered invalid.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Bishop Holds Another Meeting</p>
<p>Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to Vatican News Agency: Sixteen Roman Catholic bishops and Tadini, the secretary of the Foreign Church Affairs Committee, held a meeting yesterday. The Vatican’s Secretary of State, Mgr. Maglione, was also present. The meeting lasted for an hour and a half. The meeting discussed the relationship between the Holy See and foreign governments, and the problems raised by Pope Pius XII through Mgr. Maglione. The Vatican attaches great importance to this meeting, as the Foreign Church Affairs Committee held a meeting just a few days ago. Japanese Officers</p>
<p>Inspect the Eastern Front</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – Several Japanese military attachés and officers stationed in Berlin are currently visiting the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Xindu Hotel, published on the 3rd in Xindu, is equipped with air conditioning and is open all day, cool and comfortable. Whether it's tea tasting, dining, meetings, or socializing, it truly feels like paradise on earth. Xindu's service motto is "Young and New, Satisfying People": no wonder guests feel at home, and it is a "social center, government authority!" The Western food on the seventh floor is fully booked every day: at night, dine on Western food on the rooftop garden, with a cool breeze, looking up at the universe, truly enough to escape the mundane and relax your mind. As for the grape trellises on both sides, with flowers and trees separating the seats, it is even more suitable for intimate conversations.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Wartime National Life (1)</h3>
<p>Dialogue between Dr. Takata Yasuma and Dr. Toda Masazo</p>
<p>The situation on the Southern Front is intensifying, and it will inevitably become more severe in the future. Our people should grit their teeth and strive for the final victory. Although we are actually living a frugal life, the general public believes that we have no choice but to endure everything because we are in wartime. There may be some who hold this most passive attitude. This attitude cannot be agreed with. Whether in war or peace, if the minimum standard of living cannot be achieved, the country will decline. If we want to expect the eternal prosperity of the nation, we must, as history has shown, absolutely practice a life of endurance. This proactive approach is the belief and virtue that the people should have. At that time, not only will the Greater East Asia War be won, but the Japanese nation will also achieve a permanently stable position. This frugal life can be said to be our people's obligation to the country, which is serving the country. Therefore, understanding the principles of a frugal life and the specific methods of implementing it is indeed a matter of urgency. Therefore, we specially requested Dr. Takata, Director of the National Institute for Ethnic Studies, and Dr. Toda, Professor of the Faculty of Medicine at Kyoto Imperial University, who has extensive knowledge in design, to discuss this issue so that the people can have a thorough understanding of it.</p>
<p>Wealthy People Without Offspring – The Minimum Standard of Living is the Foundation of National Prosperity</p>
<p>Takata: I have never intended to publish anything particularly rare or novel, but this requires a premise: should we focus on individual life or on the nation or ethnic group? Once this premise is resolved, we can act freely. The idea that individual life should be improved as much as possible has indeed dominated the minds of the general public for a long time. It is true that if we want to focus on individual life, we will fear not having enough prosperity and worry about not having enough care. We will also want to find ways to improve our interests and education as much as possible. This kind of desire is natural to human beings. However, from the perspective of the nation or ethnic group, this is absolutely impossible. Competing with the technologically advanced and wealthy United States and Britain, if we want to make the country independent and the nation develop, we must use all our strength. Therefore, we must suppress our individual enjoyment or improvement of life, and at the same time, we must find ways to increase the population. This is not only for the sake of the war in the past few years, but also necessary for the eternal prosperity of the nation. It is natural for culture to improve and life to become stable, but as a result, people lose their wildness from their lives, and competition and combat gradually increase the unfavorable situation. The biggest reason is probably the decrease in the population growth rate!</p>
<p>Toda: What you said has two major distinctions: physiological reasons and human reasons. From a physiological point of view, improving individual life means indulging in luxury, which leads to a preference for a wealthy life, and as a result, the population decreases, especially the inability to produce male offspring. The so-called wealthy families having no descendants has become a well-established principle. Why is this? Everyone knows that humans have not changed in any way from millions of years ago to today. So, how have people lived for these hundreds of thousands of years? It's very simple: the easiest thing to obtain on Earth was food. For example, in the south, people could cultivate grains, and in the north, they could cultivate wheat or potatoes for food and life. Furthermore, all animal resources, such as cattle, sheep, or fish, would naturally increase their production capacity as much as possible to proliferate their own species, but now when I look at luxurious or wealthy lives, it is completely the opposite of the lives of the past hundreds of thousands of years. People do not make any effort to obtain the natural things they desire. However, they work hard to obtain things that others have acquired to supply themselves, which requires a lot of effort. This kind of behavior of seizing others' resources is not the original life of human beings. The reason why human beings have survived to this day is due to a life that conforms to nature. Any life that contradicts nature will naturally be eliminated in this world. Takata:</p>
<p>According to European statistics, aristocratic family lines die out very quickly. From a long historical perspective, all the upper classes within a country naturally die out, and the lower classes come to fill this gap, creating a cycle. And in the relationship between cities and villages, countries and countries, and ethnic groups and ethnic groups, there seems to be this kind of cycle.</p>
<p>Toda: I am currently conducting an interesting experiment on this matter. Although it is not yet ready for publication, the general idea is this: raising chickens from a difficult period under completely equal conditions. Although the conditions are completely equal, there is one difference: one group of chickens is kept in a well-ventilated house, while the other group is kept in a house with no ventilation at all. Then, by investigating their developmental status, we know that the chickens in the well-ventilated area, if they are hens, can lay 250-300 eggs each, while the fertilization rate of the eggs laid by the hens in the non-ventilated house will be greatly reduced, regardless of how many roosters are mated with them. Keeping chicks in a non-ventilated state also weakens the reproductive power of their offspring.</p>
<p>Takata: That's right. This is a very interesting experiment. It can be seen that the old-fashioned way of raising daughters is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Toda: Yes, it is naturally unacceptable to go against nature. In terms of occupation, if farmers are willing to practice the frugal life that you advocate, they can have many children. During the Tokugawa era, the rural population increased greatly, but the total population at that time did not decrease much because at that time, families with too many people had the bad habit of infanticide. If there had been no infanticide, how prosperous would the rural population have been? However, during the Tokugawa era, the population of Edo (Tokyo) of one million did not increase at all. The so-called aristocratic families would completely die out after only three generations. There was a similar situation in the Osaka shipyard. They organized and classified the things that others cultivated and used them for their own lives. In other words, they lacked the original driving force for self-development. Originally, boys maintained this driving force, but because they did not need boys, they took away this driving force and nurtured it deep down, so they could not raise adults. Therefore, in cities or wealthy families, male offspring cannot be produced, and even if they are produced, they cannot be raised successfully. This is a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>Consider Babylon or Rome, as well as today's London, Paris, New York, etc. Although the history of New York is short, the same situation can be seen, because this is the truth! (Source: Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<p>The Scope of the First Police Station is Quite Broad</p>
<p>At the same time, Watanabe also said that the area of the First Police Station includes the former West Watanabe District (east of the railway), Zhabei, and part of the city center.

<h3>Broadcasting Speech by Director Ye Gongyong</h3>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Department held a long-term broadcast to celebrate the recovery of the concessions. Last night, it was undertaken by Ye Gongyong, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, entitled "Hopes for Citizens after the Recovery of Shanghai Concessions." Excerpts from the speech are as follows:</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is currently underway, and since Shanghai has recovered its concessions, administrative unification is naturally needed to adapt to the wartime system. We hope that after the recovery of the Shanghai Concessions, Shanghai will become a model area for Chinese politics. The citizens of Shanghai should sweep away the past concept of not having a nation, earnestly obey government orders, and promote national policies. Only then can China's recovery be successful. This is my first hope for the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai has always been the economic center of China. In the future, Shanghai should become the industrial center of China. Strict restrictions must be placed on all places of consumption and distorted prosperity in order to save resources. We must strive to assist and develop all productive undertakings. We hope that the citizens of Shanghai will strive to save consumption and increase production, and absolutely correct the erroneous concept of only seeking private gain and not serving the country. We hope that every citizen will earnestly abide by Chairman Wang Jingwei's instruction of "Contribute more, enjoy less" and serve the country wholeheartedly. This is my second hope for the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai has always been known as a cultural center, but since the war, social education has been constantly regressing, and cultural undertakings have been very depressed. We hope that after the recovery of the concessions, the government and the people will work together to eradicate the roots of evil and promote culture. We must ensure that Shanghai does not lose its beautiful reputation as a cultural center and becomes the center of cultural communication in East Asia. This is my third hope for the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Headquarters Renamed Second Bureau</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Headquarters has recently received instructions from the Municipal Government that, in order to unify the names of all police stations in Shanghai after the recovery of the concessions, the First and Eighth District Police Stations will be renamed the First and Third Police Stations, and the Municipal Police Headquarters will be renamed the Second Police Station of the Shanghai Special Municipality. Lu Yingchan will continue to serve as the director of the bureau, while the police stations in Songjiang and Fengxian districts will still be under the jurisdiction of the Second Bureau.</p>
<h3>Uniforms of the Third Police Station</h3>
<p>The Third Police Station of the Shanghai Special Municipality has made special regulations for the uniforms of the police, in order to achieve uniformity. Western police officers wear summer uniforms without jackets or ties (cork helmets) from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM. From 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM the next morning, they wear summer uniforms, including jackets, French-style military caps, belts, and batons. Russian police officers wear summer uniforms without jackets (cork helmets) from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM. From 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM the next morning, they wear summer uniforms, including jackets, military caps, belts, and firearms. Chinese police officers wear summer uniforms and oiled straw hats from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM. From 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM the next morning, they wear summer uniforms, military caps, belts, handguns, and batons. All police uniforms must be neat and clean.</p>
<h3>Shanghai District Procuratorate Prevents Abuse of Litigation in Criminal Cases</h3>
<p>In order to effectively prevent the abuse of litigation in civil cases, the Shanghai District Procuratorate will require all criminal complaints to be accompanied by a document stamped by a lawyer before issuing receipts. When receiving criminal complaints, it should also first verify whether the end of the complaint has been signed and stamped by a lawyer, in order to prevent the abuse of litigation.</p>
<h3>Ren Hai, Director, Gave a Speech at the Summer Training Camp Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ren Yuandao, Director of the Naval Department, was invited to the New National Movement Civil Servants Youth and Soldier Training Camp to give a special speech yesterday morning, entitled "The Establishment of the New Chinese Navy." He elaborated on the history of the Chinese Navy, the life of naval cadets, and the importance of the Navy to the country in great detail.</p>
<h3>The Second Phase of the Epidemic Prevention Campaign Actively Begins to Promote; The First District Office Stipulates Injection Sites to Promote Cleanliness Campaigns to Eliminate Sources of Disease</h3>
<p>The second phase of epidemic prevention injections in this city has started from yesterday. All citizens who were injected before May 31 or have not been injected yet must request free injections from the health sub-offices in each district within the shortest period of time. The health departments of the first and eighth district offices will soon organize mobile injection teams to be stationed at various important road junctions to facilitate citizens to get injections nearby.</p>
<p>Injections in the Seventh District Have Also Begun</p>
<p>The second phase of epidemic prevention injections in the Nanshi District has also begun. In addition to the entrances of Xieqiao, Nanyangqiao, Dongxinqiao, Laobeimen, and Shiliupu, Dongjiadu, Santai Wharf, Nanshi Hospital, Zhonghua Road, Dadongmen, the Nanshi Health Office Clinic, the Nümiao Road Health Exhibition Room, and Bansongyuan Zhonghua Fushouyuan are designated as injection sites for nearby citizens, in order to universally eliminate the source of epidemics.</p>
<p>Expand the Promotion of Cleanliness Campaigns</p>
<p>At a time when the weather is hot, the Health Administration Bureau is now trying to expand the promotion of cleanliness campaigns to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The Baojia Self-Defense Corps members in each district should work closely with the authorities on cleanliness campaigns. All citizens are strictly prohibited from urinating everywhere, posting miscellaneous notices on walls, and accumulating stagnant water. Vendors selling unclean cold drinks are also strictly prohibited. If the self-defense corps members find that citizens in their jurisdiction are suffering from cholera, they should quickly report to the police station so that emergency measures can be taken.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Implements Ship Quarantine</h3>
<p>Plague Found in Hong Kong and Macau</p>
<p>Since cholera has been found in Hong Kong and Macau, ships coming to Shanghai from these two places must be inspected by the Seaport Quarantine Station. Jianghai Customs has notified all shipping companies to be informed.</p>
<h3>China Film Company Plans to Establish a Research Institute</h3>
<p>In order to promote the new development of China's film industry and cultivate specialized talents in various departments, China Film United Co., Ltd. is planning to establish a film research institute and has hired Fuha Yositoshi and Huang Tiansuo as director and deputy director, respectively, to carry out the preparations. Yesterday, Feng Jie, General Manager of China Film, and Fuha Yositoshi, Director of the Research Institute, invited the press of this city to clarify the purpose of the establishment, the scope of work, the internal organization, and the future prospects of the institute. First, General Manager Feng reported on the purpose and hopes for the establishment of the film research institute. Then, the Director of the Institute, Fuha Yositoshi, reported on the organization and work scope of the institute. The institute is named the China Film Research Institute, with a research headquarters and departments of culture, technology, and chemistry, which will carry out research work in groups. In addition, there will be a film school, divided into undergraduate and short-term training courses, as well as laboratories, experimental machinery workshops, experimental theaters, experimental film production sites, a film library, and a film museum. In addition to the employees of various departments of China Film, the institute will also recruit experts from various departments of the Chinese and Japanese film, drama, and cultural circles as researchers. On the one hand, it will also actively train and cultivate specialized talents in various departments, in order to lay a solid foundation for the Chinese film industry. The institute has already received a donation of one million yuan from Kawakita Nagamasa, a major figure in the Japanese film industry, and is actively proceeding with preparations. It is scheduled to be formally established in October this year.</p>
<h3>Youth League Organizes School Corps Department</h3>
<p>The summer training camp for the Youth League officially started in Shanghai on the 1st of this month. The authorities are aware that the organization of the Youth School Corps Department is urgently needed to be organized as soon as possible. Therefore, it has issued the General Regulations of the China Youth League, ordering all school corps departments to formally start training, and the commanders of each school corps department have been designated. It is reported that each school will have one commander, who will be the principal of the school, and two deputy commanders, who will be appointed from among the teachers of the school. The team system is as follows: high school students and above will form the youth team, and junior high school students and below will form the children's team.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Master Yinguang by Building a Stone Pagoda</h3>
<p>Master Yinguang, the only master of the Pure Land Sect of Chinese Buddhism, passed away the year before last. His relics pagoda has not yet been built. The devout believers and disciples in Shanghai decided at a meeting the other day to build a stone pagoda and pagoda courtyard on Lingyan Mountain in Suzhou. Because construction materials are currently expensive, they are actively raising funds from believers in this city and other places, and have entrusted the Far East Bank at the intersection of Tianjin Road and Henan Road, the He Cheng Bank on Jiangxi Road, and the Jin Kang Bank on the Museum Road to collect donations on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Food Rations in the First and Eighth Districts are Arranged and Distributed by the Jointly Operated Cooperative; The Active Transportation of Grain will be Carried out in the Future, and the Quantity will be Subject to the Unified Distribution of the Food Department</h3>
<p>Since the recovery of the two concessions, the former organs of the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council have been reformed one after another. However, whether the administrative system and working relationship of the Grain Jointly Operated Cooperative, which is responsible for the purchase of food for the two districts, have changed is of great concern to all parties. According to the person in charge of the cooperative, who spoke to a reporter from the Guofeng News Agency yesterday, there has been no change in the work of the cooperative after the recovery of the concessions. The system still belongs to the Grain Administration Bureau, and the rice purchased each month is still delivered to the First and Eighth District Offices for distribution as household rice. The transportation of food will be carried out actively in the future. A total of more than 20,000 bags were transported last month. The cooperative is acting on the orders of the Grain Administration Bureau and cannot predict how much will be transported each month. The purchase of rice in various places is based on the reports of the grain sub-bureaus in various places to the Ministry of Food, stating how much can be purchased in a certain place. Then, based on this number, the Ministry of Food makes a unified distribution. The quantity that this city and the First and Eighth Districts should receive is instructed by the Municipal Grain Bureau to the cooperative to send personnel to the designated locations to collect and transport the rice.</p>
<p>This Phase of Food Rations will be Released for Sale Soon</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the Rice and Flour Allocation Office of the Resources Control Department has distributed the warehouse receipts to the rice shops today (5th), and the rice shops will universally release the 43rd phase of household rice within the next few days.</p>
<p>The Sixth Phase of Food Sugar is Released for Sale in West Shanghai</p>
<p>The Sixth Phase of household sugar was already sold out in the First and Eighth Districts at the end of last month. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the West Shanghai District only began to universally release the household sugar of this phase on the (4th). The sugar purchase certificates for each neighborhood were also distributed on the previous day. Each resident is allowed to purchase half a catty with the certificate, at a price of two yuan and thirty-five cents, with a separate packaging fee.</p>
<p>Household Flour in the Seventh District will be Universally Released for Sale Starting Today</p>
<p>The Municipal Grain Bureau has completed the allocation of the thirteenth phase of household flour in the Nanshi District. It is stipulated that one catty and ten taels of No. 1 flour, four taels of No. 2 flour, and two taels of No. 3 flour will be allocated. Bean flour will be temporarily exempted, totaling two catties. The selling price is thirteen yuan and sixty cents. Citizens of the district should purchase it with the thirteenth phase of flour certificate. It is scheduled to be universally released for sale throughout the district starting today (6th) and will end on the 14th. It will be invalid after the deadline.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes are Distributed after Removing the Outer Packaging, Eliminating Abuse in Distribution, and Thoroughly Eliminating the Black Market</h3>
<p>After the Huazhong Tobacco Allocation Association implemented unified cigarette distribution, it formulated various regulations and dispatched goods on schedule to meet legitimate needs. Recently, in view of the increasingly rampant black market for cigarettes, which exceeded the official price by more than double, and the fact that general vendors and hoarders did not hesitate to pay high prices to purchase them, and even the distributors were involved in black market activities, this phenomenon violated the regulations. In order to thoroughly eliminate the black market and prevent transshipment and eliminate abuses, in addition to sending supervisors to supervise the operations of all wholesalers and retailers, it is stipulated that the empty packaging of all allocated cigarettes must be collected from today, and retailers are required to sell the cigarettes without the outer packaging. However, each person is still limited to one pack. At the same time, the police authorities are responsible for cracking down on peddlers who specialize in selling cigarettes on the black market on the streets.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Scholarship Exam Papers Graded in Order of Priority, Approved Amounts for Each Level to Be Increased, Those with Poor Grades Still Difficult to Subsidize</h3>
<p>The fifth Shen Bao Reader Scholarship exams for senior primary, junior high, and senior high school groups were held successively on the 1st and 2nd of this month. Current primary and secondary school teachers were hired by the Men and Women's Christian Association to grade the exam papers. The primary school group's exam papers have now been graded, and the overall performance is satisfactory. An investigation and review are currently underway. It is decided that starting from the 10th, results will be announced gradually and in order. The exam papers for the other junior high and senior high school levels will also be completed soon. As for the university and business groups, various procedures are being expedited in order to announce the approved list of names as early as possible.</p>
<p>Approved Amount to Be Appropriately Increased At the beginning of this year's scholarship program, due to the large number of applications and limited funds, the scholarship amount was small. However, with the enthusiastic support of various sectors of society, the scholarship funds have been increasing daily. However, with the sharp increase in tuition fees for various schools this semester, it is now planned to appropriately increase the amount based on the circumstances. It is still hoped that people from all walks of life will continue to donate generously in order to reduce the burden on impoverished students. However, those with poor grades and those whose families are not impoverished will still be rejected by this newspaper in accordance with the scholarship regulations.</p>
<p>Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday The scholarship funds received by this newspaper yesterday, with titles listed below: Shou Zhe Xiang (submitted by Universal Trust Bank) 2,500 yuan, Jin Xing Industrial Raw Material Company 2,000 yuan, Cao Jiexie 1,000 yuan, Youth Department of the Christian Youth Association Zhong Guang Si Qing Fellowship 530 yuan, Quan Liang and Hong Meiyu (Wang Hejun and Hejun He respectively) 100 yuan each, Shen Xinrong (to commemorate the 70th birthday of the late aunt Yu) 60 yuan, Tang He 20 yuan, totaling 6,310 yuan in reserve bonds, with a balance of 1,476,646 yuan.</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Increases Skills of Refugees, Opens Knitting and Sewing Courses, Continuously Accepting Over 800 Refugees</h3>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society's Refugee Skills Training Center has successively taken in over 600 refugees. Currently, refugees are being continuously sent from various Wan Song centers. After inspection and elimination of over 70 people, the statistics for the most recent week show an increase of 195 people, totaling approximately 800 men. The Executive Committee of the Society has been earnestly planning small-scale handicrafts for the center in accordance with the training guidelines. Recently, 72 hand-operated knitting machines and 10 wooden yarn-shaking machines were specially transported there. Sheng Jun of Sheng Jia Weaving Company is in charge of the work, and five skilled technicians have been selected to live at the center and provide instruction. The raw materials for knitting are being negotiated with various yarn factories by the Executive Committee of the Society. In addition, the center has 15 tailors with both Chinese and Western skills. The Society has specially purchased four sewing machines and handed them over to the director to organize a garment department, soliciting business from all walks of life. At the same time, refugees with an interest in sewing are being selected and instructed to learn, in order to expand the business.</p>
<h3>Tax Exemption for Faculty and Staff of Universities and Colleges, Welfare Association Previously Submitted a Request, Ministry Approved Exemption for Months Prior to April</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association previously stated that the income of faculty and staff of universities and colleges was extremely meager, and they still had to pay salary income tax, making their lives even more difficult. Therefore, it submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education, requesting that they be granted the same treatment as primary school teachers and be exempt from income tax, in order to show the government's concern for and respect for teachers. A reply has recently been received from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education, stating: "The salary income tax reported for the months prior to April 1932 for faculty and staff of universities and colleges is tentatively approved for exemption. Starting from May 1932, it will still be collected at the prescribed rate in accordance with the Income Tax Regulations. However, taxes that have already been paid will not be refunded." It is also stated that the Income Tax Bureau has already instructed its subordinate collection bureaus in all districts to comply.</p>
<h3>Funeral Gifts for Self-Defense Guards Who Died in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>The following is a list of funeral gifts sent by various sectors of society to the self-defense guards who died in the line of duty, collected by this newspaper on the specified date: Rui Kang Shen, Xiang Tai, Chang Xin, 5 yuan each; Zhang Weisheng, Shen Yushan, 20 yuan each; totaling 190 yuan in reserve bonds, with a previous balance of 6,980 yuan, and a total balance of 7,170 yuan.</p>
<p>(Note) The funeral gifts sent by the colleagues of each Bao in the Second Joint Bao of the Old Gate District to the self-defense guard Guan, totaling 15,412 yuan in reserve bonds, could not be published with the names of the donors due to space constraints. Mr. Zhang Songtao, the head of the Joint Bao, has sent a letter requesting the return of the funds, and this newspaper has returned the funds in full. The amount has also been removed from the total balance. This is a special announcement.</p>

<h3>Football Charity Match to Celebrate the Recovery of the Concessions, Three Provinces vs. Righteous Naval Forces, Prelude Miniature Football Match Three Provinces vs. St. John's Tonight at 6 PM at Yiyuan</h3>
<p>The San Sheng Sports Association is holding a football charity match for scholarships to celebrate the recovery of the concessions. The second act of the charity match will be held at Yiyuan tonight. The San Sheng team will face the Righteous Naval Forces, the "Four Men's League" of the football world. Starting at 5:00 PM, a prelude miniature football match will be added, with San Sheng facing St. John's. Mr. Wu Yunzhai, chairman of the Xinwen Bao newspaper, will be specially invited to kick off the match, and Mr. Chen Binhe, president of the Shen Bao newspaper, will give a speech. During the match, a charity ball will be auctioned off, presided over by the three elders, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, and Wen Mou. After the match, Mr. Zhou, daughter of the Minister of Finance, will be invited to present the awards, and Mr. Pan Sansheng, president of the San Sheng Sports Association, will give a thank-you speech. In the first act miniature football match, Fang Rongdang will be the referee. Since its establishment, the San Sheng team has been invincible, with a seemingly miniature football hegemony. St. John's is a Western iron army, which dominated the Fourth Group C competition in the last competition. Wang Li will take the stage at 6:00 PM. After defeating the Western Union a few days ago, San Sheng has spare strength to fight the Righteous Naval Forces again today. Zhang Le will be the referee. In addition to inviting Zhang Lingen to participate in the San Sheng lineup, Wu Binghao, who has just returned to Shanghai from the South, will also assist, serving as the left wing, making the cooperation more seamless. It is said that the position of left wing in the Shanghai Chinese football world has always been a talent shortage. Sun Tie Leg is now recovering to his former peak state, and Ayou Liang is even more impeccable. Fei Chunhua has excellent speed. The five forwards are exceptionally well-matched. The central defender line of Song Qu has been cooperating for a long time, and their performance is even more magical. Wu Qixiang on the right, this public figure is an all-rounder and can often perform happily. Defender Li Tiansheng, who is not old in the competition, has seen him grow stronger in his old age. Zhang Lingen's right guard, with his broadsword, will definitely be able to repel the enemy thousands of miles away. In addition, the goalkeeper Liu Xianhan, his daily performances, his technology has reached the pinnacle. As for the Righteous Army, which has been dormant for a long time, this time they are righteously sending troops. The original generals Rossier, Maiqidi, Xilati, Xue Davila, and Dipanna are all as fierce as before, and the new generals K伦鲍,史蒂法诺,契格尼,潘格诺, etc., are also brave soldiers. Sijia Luodi, with the same style as Mainidi, has a higher level of saving skills. The overall strength of the team is strong. The competition between the three parties is worthy of being evenly matched. A thrilling and tense performance is inevitable. Tickets are 50 yuan and 20 yuan. The four major theaters, including Da Guangming, and the National Sports Equipment Company on the Feilu Road, etc., are selling them until 4:00 PM. The charity ball is donated by the National Sports Equipment Company. The lineups are as follows:</p>

<h3>Thoroughly Eliminate the Black Market</h3>
<p>Universal consumer rationing is enough to block the path for merchants to seize illegal profits. It was already mentioned yesterday in the discussion on "Rationing Matches to Households." At the same time, this argument is also being made for the black market in cigarettes. Because if rationing is inadequate, or it is difficult to get rations and you can't get them, then a black market will arise; the black market for rice, sugar, salt, and oil can be extended to the black market for any kind of goods.</p>
<p>Taking the cigarette black market as an example, the Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association has also realized that what actual consumers are getting is not the limited-price cigarettes rationed in tobacco stores, but the high-priced cigarettes sold by Han peddlers in front of theaters and on the streets and alleys. These high-priced cigarettes are two or three times higher than the limited price. Is this the profit of the peddlers? Or the common interest of small shops? We don't know, but in short, actual consumers have increased their burden several times.</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly eliminate the black market, the association specially announced yesterday that "all rationed cigarette empty packs must be collected from today onwards." This is of course a standard approach to strictly curb the black market. I still remember in Hong Kong after December 8th of the year before last, everyone hoarded canned food, and the black market was rampant, so the authorities had to order shops to sell canned coffee and milk powder, they must open the can, sell canned fish, meat, vegetables and fruits, and the sign paper must be torn off, so that they cannot re-enter the black market. These are all the same in terms of thoroughly eliminating the black market.</p>
<h3>Interbank Lending by the Banking Association to Be Handled According to New Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Joint Preparation Committee settles once. After the committee reconciles interbank lending among various banks and firms, starting in August, each interbank lending amount will be handled according to new regulations. Interbank lending is limited to: Banks that are members of the Banking Association, Qianye United Preparation Bank re-lent to various firms, member banks of the Preparation Committee exchange banks and correspondent banks, and trust companies. Each interbank loan is based on 200,000 yuan. The total amount of interbank lending by the Preparation Committee is limited to the sum of 2/10 of the total current deposit of each interbank plus the base number. However, if the total amount of current deposits of each interbank exceeds 30 million yuan, the lending amount exceeding that portion should be calculated at 1/10. The total amount of lending by the Preparation Committee to Qianku is limited to 50 million yuan. Regarding the number of current deposits, the Preparation Committee should calculate the average of the figures submitted by each interbank at the end of the previous three months when paying the deposit reserve in January, April, July, and October each year. The property provided by each bank and firm for lending is limited to the following: Government securities, Chinese stocks and bonds, real estate with no income in the Shanghai urban area, Preparation Committee public orders, public treasury certificates, goods that can be sold immediately in this market, the owner is a legitimate industrial or manufacturer, and the purpose is not to hoard for profit. The total evaluation of the goods provided by each firm shall not exceed 25% of the total amount of lending approved by the Preparation Committee for each firm. The lending rate will be determined by the Preparation Committee at any time with reference to market conditions, and the Preparation Committee will settle it once at the end of each month.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Adjusts Remittance Rates in Various Places</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has been increasing the number of branches and offices in the interior, and the financial network has become more closely knit. Because the use of funds in the interior is active, the remittance business is booming, in order to facilitate merchants and reduce the burden of remittances, the special remittance rates in various places have been readjusted and revised as follows: From Shanghai to Guangzhou, each 1,000 yuan is subject to a floating rate (including mail and draft remittances) of 20 yuan, and telegraphic transfer is 80 yuan per transaction; Xiamen Shantou remittance rate is 15 yuan per 1,000 yuan, and telegraphic transfer is 80 yuan; Hankou Anqing Jiujiang Nanchang remittance rate is 10 yuan per 1,000 yuan, telegraphic transfer is 50 yuan per transaction; Qingbo remittance rate is 5 yuan per 1,000 yuan, telegraphic transfer is 50 yuan per transaction; Nantong remittance rate is 3 yuan per 1,000 yuan, telegraphic transfer is 50 yuan per transaction; Taixian Yangzhou remittance rate is 1.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan, telegraphic transfer is 50 yuan; Nanjing Hangzhou Bengbu Zhenjiang Wuhu Wuxi Changzhou Changre remittance rate is 1 yuan per 1,000 yuan, telegraphic transfer is 50 yuan per transaction; Suzhou Jiaxing Songjiang Kunshan Taicang remittance rate is 0.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan, telegraphic transfer is 50 yuan per transaction. A handling fee of 2 yuan per transaction will be added for mail and draft remittances, and a handling fee of 3 yuan will be added for telegraphic transfer.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Determines Agricultural Loan Policy</h3>
<p>The specific policies for rural loans conducted by the Bank of Communications have been determined. It is said that the total amount of loans is expected to be 50 million yuan. In addition to especially emphasizing loans to individual farmers, the loan policy also lends to rural public affairs and cooperatives as capital. The loan areas are Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, as well as Nanjing and Shanghai municipalities, including Wuxing Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province, Wuxian Wujin Kunshan Changre Kujiang Jingyang Wuxi in Jiangsu Province, Wuhu Dangtu Hefei Wuwei Guangming County in Anhui Province, Jiangning Zhenjiang Jurong Liuhe Shangxinhe Yanzi in Nanjing, and Jiading Taicang Baoshan Liuhe Chongming Jiangqian Aosong Pudong in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Materials Review Committee Holds Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Materials Notification Review Committee held its fifth committee meeting in Shanghai yesterday (the 5th) afternoon at 3:00 PM. All Chinese and Japanese committee members, Chairman Zhou Fohai, Committee Member Mei Siping, Committee Member Gu Shiheng, Committee Member Chen Junpu, Committee Member Tang Shoumin, Committee Member Shao Shijun, and Minister Horinouchi, Minister Tajiri, Homori Ichiichi, Imamura Kichita, Fukuchi Masao, Egawa Hideyu and others, as well as all incumbent affairs officers Yuan Yuyi, Zhang Jun, and Wang Zhigang were present. After Chairman Zhou reported on the food affairs situation and proposals, the following important cases were discussed and resolved: Whether the native tobacco industry should be included in the main commodities. And whether it can be allowed to be freely transported and sold, the resolution will be decided after investigating the facts. Whether native candles should be included in the main commodities, it was resolved to allow it to be included. Whether the fur industry should be included in the main commodities, and whether a separate association can be formed, it was resolved to allow it to be included in the main commodities, and to allow the formation of a separate association.</p>
<h3>Private Warehouses Begin Investigation Today</h3>
<p>Since the Materials Investigation Committee appointed one investigator from the Japanese related authorities, a total of fifteen people, leading more than one hundred investigators, divided into thirty groups, began the investigation, more than two weeks have passed. Now the first step of investigating the public warehouses and promotion stations in the first and eighth districts, the materials stored are generally investigated and completed, and the continuation is being audited. Once the audit is completed, those belonging to hoarding behavior will be reported to the congress and punished according to law. It is now learned that the association will start today (the 6th), and the investigators will still be led by each investigator to investigate the materials hoarded in private warehouses. The selection of investigators for this time has been strictly screened, and they all hold proof documents when going out for investigation, and they have been strictly warned that the members are not allowed to have illegal investigation behaviors.</p>
<h3>The First District Will Thoroughly Investigate the Hoarding of Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>After the formal establishment of the First District Office of the Concession Recovery, the district office authorities are now carefully studying countermeasures for all activities in the district. It is said that the district office authorities, in addition to continuing the policy of the former Shanghai Municipal Council in principle, strictly implementing commodity price limits, and cracking down on speculation and hoarding, the first step is to find out that the black market sales of foreign goods in the city in recent days, such as soap, candles, matches, cigarettes, paper, etc., are extremely rampant, and illegal merchants are searching for and hoarding a large number of goods, causing the prices of daily necessities to skyrocket day and night, almost doubling compared to a month ago, and poisoning the people's livelihood to a deep and huge extent. Therefore, the district office authorities have decided to immediately take the same measures as the former Shanghai Municipal Council to thoroughly investigate cotton yarn and cotton cloth, and to thoroughly investigate them. No matter whether a store or an individual has conclusive evidence of hoarding foreign goods, they will be severely punished, without exception.</p>
<h3>Hua Stock Trends</h3>

<h3>First Batch of New Zhoupu Japonica Rice on the Market</h3>
<p>The rice market in this city has been quite chaotic recently. The price of white rice on the black market is rising under the pull of hoarders. Yesterday, 3,000 to 4,000 packages of rice were transported to the rice market on Che Lun Er Road. Although the number was not small, and the transactions on this street were very small, the market price rose again under the absorption of new hoarders. At the same time, 230 kg of new Zhoupu Japonica rice arrived on the market, with a price of around 2. The latter is the first call of this year's new rice appearance. It is estimated that in another two weeks, the number of new Japonica rice transported to Shanghai will increase.</p>

<h3>Creating Our Path</h3>
<p>— Sheng Quan</p>
<p>Life is inherently about walking: advancing, retreating, wandering, hesitating...</p>
<p>Mediocre people only seek a single type of path; a path to survive and enjoy from birth to death. Great people create great paths, allowing many to live peacefully and even propel the world forward. General Kemal created a path that granted freedom, equality, and happiness to the Turkish people. Father Sun Yat-sen created a path that freed the descendants of the Yellow Emperor from the shackles of imperial rule.</p>
<p>Originally, there were no so-called paths in the world. Paths are formed by people walking them. Therefore, paths are created by people.</p>
<p>Many people walk down dead ends and do not turn back, groaning and even being destroyed there. Many people embark on broad roads, but their will wavers, and they cannot endure fatigue and hardship, ultimately retreating.</p>
<p>Young people, look at the bloodstains of predecessors, your own scars, and learn from your own walking experiences. Then, with caution, courage, and solemn steps, set upon a bright and broad path. Although it will inevitably be difficult and arduous, create new paths or complete the unfinished paths of predecessors. And eliminate those dead ends to spare future generations from groaning and being destroyed there, because we no longer recognize them as paths!</p>
<p>Life is inherently about choosing a path, but let us not forget to choose the right path!</p>
<h3>Striving and Complacency</h3>
<p>— Li Xiang</p>
<p>Generally, when a person, especially one of the scholar-official class, reaches a point where their living environment is dire, with no means of support, they know to be stimulated and encouraged. But when they are in a state of leisure and comfort, without worries, they become complacent and seek only temporary ease. This is truly a universal phenomenon, "It has been so since ancient times, and is even more so now."</p>
<p>We often see many wealthy sons and brothers relying on their ancestors' fortunes, not engaging in production, not pursuing proper occupations, indulging in extravagance and dissipation, and abandoning themselves. When they eventually exhaust their resources and fall into destitution, they may even become thieves, endangering social stability. These people, as described in Zheng Banqiao's poem, "Pitiful are the hungry and cold children on the road, who yesterday slept on silk cushions in magnificent halls," illustrates the fallen state of those wealthy sons and brothers, which is the result of "comfort leading to complacency."</p>
<p>Consider the ambitious individuals of ancient times, such as Che Yin, who used the light of fireflies to study, and Sun Jing, who tied his hair to the beam to encourage learning. Su Qin pricked his thigh with an awl; Bai Lixi and Guan Zhong, as well as the historical figures who rose from commoners to become princes and lords, none of them were not born in adversity and died in comfort. As the saying goes, "For ten years, no one asks about the scholar under the window; once he succeeds, the whole world knows." In an instant, they transformed into prominent figures, returning to their hometowns in glory, their heads held high. These individuals achieved this due to "poverty leading to striving."</p>
<p>The traces of past history are inherently the best lessons of reality. It must be known that "starting a business" is certainly difficult, but "maintaining the legacy" is not easy either. How many people in the world can escape the temptation of material enjoyment? "Striving" and "complacency," which path to take, depends entirely on each individual's rational choice.</p>
<h3>Fortune-Telling and Divination</h3>
<p>— Shou</p>
<p>People often resort to fortune-telling and divination when they are indecisive. This is not necessarily done only by those who are ignorant. Even those who have received a considerable education, once they pass the age of forty, many unconsciously become somewhat fascinated by astrology. "Is there any harm in fortune-telling and face-reading?" This is their explanation for consulting fortune-tellers.</p>
<p>Perhaps some might think, "No matter what, fortune-tellers must have some ability, right?" But heaven knows, nine out of ten fortune-tellers are blind fools. Someone with eyes who can see the realities of society instead seeks guidance from a groping blind man – it's truly the most absurd thing in the world! What are their abilities? Fortune-tellers with eyes have eyes that can discern appearances and hands that can write vague predictions; blind fortune-tellers have ears that listen carefully to what you say and mouths that are good at deceiving. To put it bluntly, they are just big swindlers.</p>
<p>However, in the eyes of some who are obsessed with astrology, the words of fortune-tellers are golden advice, and their predictions are "compass needles guiding the way." If one or two sentences about the past or future happen to be correct, it is considered the divine skill of the fortune-teller. If they are incorrect, it's just their own bad luck. When they undertake a task, instead of exerting effort to do it, they wait for their "luck" to arrive. In the end, they achieve nothing and still shake their heads and sigh, saying it's fate!</p>
<p>Those who are obsessed, wake up! The person who can control your life is yourself! If you want to achieve something in this difficult era, you must firm your own will, work hard, and remember that you are the master of your own destiny.</p>

<h3>Please Pay Attention to the Serious Problem of Housing Hoarding</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhi</p>
<p>Currently, the authorities are being quite strict in investigating hoarding, which is truly a blessing for the new citizens of Shanghai. However, some speculators are using their imagination and gathering huge amounts of capital to engage in planned hoarding and trading of houses. They either collect several years' rent in advance or threaten tenants to move out, then repeatedly rent out the properties to seek profit. The housing hoarding and trading on Rue Luber is a prominent example. The houses in 　　Fang, numbering hundreds, were originally the property of the French company "Construction &amp; Real Estate." Recently, the company sold them for over 22 million yuan to a large housing hoarding group, "　　Company," which then sold the houses individually, ranging from over 400,000 to 500,000 or 600,000 yuan each. The company sent letters to the residents of the neighborhood, demanding that they sign contracts within three days, pay a 30% deposit on the spot, another 20% later, and the remaining 50% in two months, with interest calculated according to market rates. Failure to comply would result in the cancellation of the deal. 　　Company can make a profit of over one million yuan in one transaction, which is extremely illegal.</p>
<p>Now that the two concessions have just been taken over, the people are eagerly hoping that the authorities will demonstrate their new policies and cultivate the people's faith in politics. How can we tolerate these lawless profiteers doing whatever they want? It not only affects the security of wartime rear areas but also threatens the housing burden of residents in this city. If this trend is allowed to continue, those with ulterior motives will surely follow suit and intensify the problem, which would be disastrous. It is deeply believed that the municipal government, while focusing on ensuring food for the people, should also pay attention to the "housing" issue within the principles of people's livelihood. Strong measures should be taken against such profit-seeking groups engaged in housing hoarding.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the International Charitable Organization: The Salesian Society (Part 1) - A Relief Organization for Suffering Children - A Training Institute for Building Talent</h3>
<p>The most famous industrial area in Shanghai, Yangshupu, the most tranquil cultural area, Guohuo Road in Nanshi, and the pastoral Nanhsiang and Jiangwan, are home to the cultural and charitable endeavors of the Salesian Society, founded by Italians. As the word "Italy" is being widely discussed, it would be particularly meaningful to visit and introduce the undertakings founded in China by these Italians to our fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>A Great Man of the Nineteenth Century - Bosco</p>
<p>Father O'Mié, who currently oversees some of the Salesian Society's work in Shanghai, spoke enthusiastically about their endeavors, first emphasizing the remarkable history of Saint John Bosco, the founder of the Salesian Society of the Catholic Church. This Saint Bosco has stories and biographies circulating internationally, full of interest and wisdom. Un Grande Italiano by the famous Italian author Ruffino Uguccioni is being eagerly translated by various countries, and the Chinese version, "A Great Man of the Nineteenth Century," published by St. Louis Industrial School in Hong Kong, vividly depicts the life of this Saint Bosco, who "used poverty to save the poor." He was born in 1815 in a humble cottage in Becchi, near Turin. At the age of two, he lost his father and was raised by his widowed mother, who was only twenty-seven years old. Due to poverty and the good guidance of his compassionate mother, he was very intelligent from a young age and hoped to improve the lives of poor children. Lacking enough food and clothing himself, he naturally couldn't afford to study. He had to learn some skills from traveling performers. At a young age, he left home with tears in his eyes to make a living. Because he was quick-witted, he had a deep understanding, especially in illusions and drama, and had a great attraction and appeal to both children and adults. However, until the age of thirteen, he had not attended school, but only worked as a servant while learning privately. At the age of twenty, he entered the monastery to study. At the same time, he also put into practice his kindness in improving the lives of the poor and fallen youth in the neighborhoods. His first step was to find an empty house to accommodate children who were without clothing, food, or a home, teaching them some knowledge and small crafts to enable them to support themselves in a very short period of time. The news spread, and soon he had taken in more than three hundred people. However, on the one hand, there was not enough porridge for everyone, so he had to find another place to live. On the other hand, the neighbors were annoyed by the children's noise, so he was driven out by the authorities. After several setbacks, he finally overcame the difficulties. Later, he even established larger-scale charitable organizations such as schools for the poor, raising funds and educating poor children, which consumed almost all of his time. From 1841 onwards, he organized Salesiano Salesian Society schools in various industrial areas of Italy, specializing in the admission of poor, out-of-school children, providing them with general and vocational education. Later, he gradually expanded abroad, and the name of the Salesian Society of Bosco became well-known throughout the world. From 1861 onwards, he founded the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians (the Immaculate Conception) to help poor girls, coordinating with the Salesian Society to become an international charitable organization that educates poor boys and girls. Although he was already seventy years old, he still traveled to foreign countries for this cause, and did not pass away amidst universal mourning until 1888. However, he had left behind an immortal career. His missionaries now number in the thousands, and his work has spread to five continents, with tens of thousands of Salesian monks and Daughters of Mary Help of Christians nuns continuing his great work.</p>

<h3>Income and Expenditure Report for Donations in July</h3>
<p>With soaring prices and high cost of living, coupled with the scorching heat, the number of people suffering from poverty and illness is increasing daily. At the same time, the number of people applying to this office for relief is also increasing. However, because this office has been committed to promoting disaster relief in North China and scholarships in the past, there have only been expenditures and no income for various subsidies. Now that the accounting for disaster relief and scholarships has come to an end, it is unbearable to see the poor and sick crying out without help. We eagerly hope that benevolent people will quickly open their purses and continue to donate. The income and expenditure report for last month is as follows:</p>
<p>Poverty Relief Fund: Balance at the end of June: 48,184.70 yuan. July expenditure: 900.00 yuan. Balance: 47,284.70 yuan.</p>
<p>Small Business Loan Fund: Balance at the end of June: 7,635.00 yuan. July expenditure: 910.00 yuan. Balance: 6,725.00 yuan.</p>
<p>Elementary School Scholarship Fund: Balance at the end of June: 45,900.50 yuan. July income: 1,000.00 yuan. July expenditure: 6,043.00 yuan. Balance: 40,857.50 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Chao-Shan Relief Association Will Hold a Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting</h3>
<p>Since the Chao-Shan Association in Shanghai launched its campaign to raise funds for disaster relief in Chao-Shan, it has received the support of famous people in Shanghai and the generous donations from all walks of life, with quite remarkable results. However, because the disaster area of Chao-Shan is located in a remote corner by the sea and transportation is difficult, it has not yet received the deep attention of society. Therefore, the Association has initiated a charity exhibition of calligraphy and painting, firstly to awaken the attention of all walks of life, and secondly to conduct a more general fundraising campaign. The Association sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, entrusting us to widely solicit famous works. This newspaper believes that since the disasters in North China and the waters of Hua are all suffered by our compatriots, disaster relief should not be divided by regions. We have agreed to transfer all the remaining items from this Hua North Emergency Exhibition to the Association for charity sale, and the funds will be used for emergency relief in Chao-Shan. We hope that all donors to this newspaper will continue to do good deeds. It is heard that the event is scheduled to be held at the Ningbo Association Hall starting on the 15th of this month. We hope that enthusiastic people at home and abroad will show the same spirit of relieving disaster in North China and generously donate to South China.</p>
