<h3 id="c1">防空學習與市民責任 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自昨日起，本市開始舉行夏日民衆防空演習，這種演習的意義，不僅在使防空保甲及地方警衛人員練習各種防空工作，尤其在使一般市民，習慣於防空的生活，熟悉各種防空規則，嚴守紀律，守望相助。</p>
<p>社會上對於防空演習，雖非初次經歷，但是抱着錯誤觀念的，也頗不乏其人。第一種人，自事變以來，從未看到實際的戰爭，以上海爲安樂窩，過着和平時期的生活，由於這種錯誤觀念，對於防空演習漠不關心，至多認爲一種新玩意，處身於事外，於是防空演習之夜，酒樓舞塲，特別熱鬧。第二種是對於防空演習，存有一種過分的恐怖心理，甚且神經過敏，以爲演習是實際空襲的前奏，因此每當防空演習，即表示過度的緊張，深居不出，入夜即不點燈，表面上似乎很守法，實際上殊失舉行演習的本意。此外，還有第三種人，抱着一知半解的軍事知識與政治理解，或是誤解上海旣無高山深洞，又無可靠防空避難所，防空根本無效，或是誤解防空全爲中日當局之事，與我小民無涉。這種錯誤思想，如不根本破除，則對於防空演習的成效，會有不良的影響。</p>
<p>國際戰局，已逼近決戰階段，友邦日本在太平洋上的戰鬥勢態，雖已處於優越地位，但是敵人的野心則始終沒有放棄，在實力上敵人旣無反攻的可能，而空中游擊戰的顧慮，我們不能沒有。中國是參戰的國家，每一個人民，就都負有參戰國民的義務，無論你願意與吾，敵人的侵害是沒有抉擇的。因此，每一個市民，都應有必要的警惕和準備。也因此，在防空演習中，抱着實際空襲下的心理，切實了解和遵守一切防空中的法令與規則，嚴格遵守演習中的秩序，是我們最起碼的責任。同時，在防空演習中，我們希望保甲人員及指揮防空人員們，除了自己盡忠職守，努力服務之外，對於誤犯規則的份子，應該婉轉勸告，詳加解釋，對於不受勸告的倔强份子，則應嚴格依法處辦。</p>
<p>防空演習是國民戰時生活的一種敎育，也是國民心理的品格的一種測騐，我們希望人人自尊自重，處處表示自治與互助的精神，即不在演習期內，也要隨時準備着，警戒着。</p>
<h3 id="c2">夏令衛生二三事 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>今年的夏季，氣候極不正常，但因此往往有人忽略了夏令衛生問題，很容易引起病患。這幾天氣候已漸炎熱，公共衛生方面，雖然已有負責當局積極努力，如防疫與淸潔等，但以上海地域之廣大，人口之密集，加以一般市民經濟力量之衰落，要求公衆衛生健康之保持，仍不能不依靠市民各自的注意。</p>
<p>首先，在飲食方面，由於近來物價之飛漲如在，市上已有極不合衛生的現象發生，（一）經濟力比較寬裕的人家，拼命囤購米·麵粉·雜糧及其他食品，經過今年特長的霉雨期，大部都巳生虫及發生變化；（二）中下等飲食店，貪圖便宜及利潤，除了囤積食品之外，更　用次貨及宿貨，對於顧客健康，絕不顧惜；（三）中下等家庭，鑒於物價之高，濫食粗劣腐壞食品，明知發酵的宿食與爲蠅鈉所聚的食品，也不捨得拋棄。這種現象，不僅影響個人健康，且大有害公共衛生。我們一方面希望常局嚴查一切飲食店及冷飲冷食攤之衛生情形，另一方面允盼市民互相勸導，濫食之害，甚於絕食，對於外間飲食及生冷，允當特別戒備。拒絕葷腥及冷食品，絕不囤積食物，於節的及國民經濟，皆有絕大裨益。</p>
<p>本市一般人民住宅，已有人滿之患，私人與公共衛生，都有無暇顧及之勢，普通二房東之目的只在多收房租，對於家庭衛生，毫不盡責，一般房客，或由於無知，或由於不合作，對於同一房屋，同一里衖或同一街道的淸潔衛生，毫不負責。鴿棚之屋，穢物亂棄，惡臭薰蒸，臭虫蚊蠅成陣，已成普遍現象。若干較爲靜僻之處，則更大道之上，人畜排洩物觸目皆是。至於隨地吐痰，又復舊時狀態。於是公共衛生大受影響。我們希望保甲自警團等出來指導勸誡。並盼各戶長及房客自動組織衛生檢查，合作互助，展開淸潔衛生運動。</p>
<p>除積極的防疫與衛生運動之外，我們不能不對目前本市若干現象表示最大的遺憾；第一是囤積藥物的風氣，不問藥物之本質效能，一味收囤，抬價出售。往往極平常的藥物，索價如金，甚且造成市上斷貨狀態，有些藥品，更因失了時效，雖以高價買得，仍無助於治療，而偷工减料，以及僞造藥品，也所在皆有。對於市民健康之威脅英過於此。第二是若干醫院與少數醫師醫療收費的昻貴，往往右超過一般物價水凖者，此在富人，原無問題。對於一般市民，實不勝負担，以致抱病不敢問醫者，日增一日，至於一部份醫生診治及看護對於一般病人之組心輕忽，以及少數無學識無經騐的醫生之自由掛脾應診，在今日尤爲危險現象，所有這些，我們除了希望關係當局之善處以外，甚盼各同業之自我檢討與一般市民之大胆檢舉。</p>

<p>上海法國專管租界交還我國，巳於廿二日晨在京舉行協定簽訂　式，茲誌法方柏參事致詞，與我國褚外長答詞如下：</p>
<p>褚外長答詞</p>
<p>今日舉行簽訂交還上海法租界協定儀式、本人得任主席，至深榮幸。法國雖當多難之秋，毅然自動在最早可能之時，實施共今年二月二十三日之聲明，先後交還北京東交民巷使館區，鼓浪嶼公共租界，津漢粵三法國專管租界各處之行政權，頃又簽訂交還上海法租界行政機之協定，此種賢明措置與友誼表示，誠使吾人所感謝不置也。此次談判之始　雙方代表彼此均有相互之了解與和平之精神，是以在折銜過程中。得無重大困難，而能順利完成彼等所負之使命，本人敬以　府名義。對之表示欽佩之忱，關於行將交還之上海法租界，中國政府將　其全方，使之發展成爲世界所零羡之都市。在新制度下法國人民，不必過肅其前途，彼等將繼爲吾人保護，俾中法二國固有之友誼，毫無影響。至於租界內之慈善及文化事業，亦將設法使之日益發展，其補助費仍繼續予以維特，蓋此種事業，大有裨益於中法兩國文化之溝通與接近也。最後本人深信今日簽訂之協定，足爲吾等將來關係之基石，而增進中法兩國固有之友誼　　也。</p>
<p>柏參事致詞</p>
<p>法國政府一九四三年二月二十三日之聲明，其中最要點之一、已藉頃間簽訂之協定而見諸實施。法國當局現將近百年歷史之上　法和界行政權交遼中國，深信此種有價値之措置，必能獲得中國之同情與重視。上　市與法租界之廣泛區域，在中國與世界其他各國關係聯繫日趨密切繁榮之歷史上，實具非常之重要性。百年以來此爲谷種商務與金融櫺紐之大商埠，致使中國在世界經濟上佔有顯殊之地位。法國彷面對此大都市之建設未敢自詡已盡協助之力，惟於交還夙所擔負之行政權之際，深幸得將偉大建築以及堪與新式都市比儗之模範設備與組織無償移讓中國。吾人確信此後上海在新制度管理下，法租界內所設合作事業，必能顧及兩國人民共同利益。得以推進與發展也。兩國代表團此次以充滿友誼之精神，進行種種談判，固未嘗專注於經濟上或實際上之間題。一九西三年七月二十二日之協定，本其對於文化慈善事業之重要性，更能將兩國間數世紀來以迄今日所具有特殊性質之文化合作精神得以發揚光大。允有甚者，際此歷史上之新時代，中法兩國應以道義精神爲先、維特在世界上對於文明進化素多貢獻之習俗潰風，則雙方自當通力合作，傳將來在精神上科學上智識上能恢復固有之光榮。本人謹以此種信念爲兩國前途賀頌，且深信在外交部長褚民誼博士閣下所主持之中法合作事業，必能日益蓬勃，並祝中法兩國友誼益臻鞏固。</p>

<p>— 紈絝兒拉斯金</p>
<p>維多利亞時代還有一人值得記憶的，那就是拉斯金，拉斯金是受加萊爾感化最多的一人，即使有人說他是加萊爾的門人，本人亦未表示不滿。然而他另有　獨特的立塲。他是倫敦某酒商的獨子、父母鍾愛逾恒，所謂紈袴兒賓是。　紈袴兒的氣質，直至他八十餘歲死時爲止，並無變更，他以繪畫的批評家而被知於世。他的大作「近世畫家」的一部分，就是他在牛津大學時代所作的，以此可知他是早熱的一人。</p>
<p>他與加萊爾比較起來，在美的感知上，具有極精　細　的官能。他把野花岫雲，却看作宇宙間之無限的美·他主張把眞·善·美合併起來始能稱爲美。他所說的美之中有善，善之中有眞、眞之中有美。這眞善美在他是一貫的東四，他常總括之稱爲美。所以他不欲以獨善的生活自我滿足，而兼顧別人。在這裏，他對社會主義雖大加反對，但同時以勞　者的親友自任。　親自建造了聖喬治會館，爲勞　者設立會館，親自擔任演講。即此可知其一端。</p>
<p>他不以達耶等畫家的批評爲滿足，他進而想樹立個人的經濟學，他赴自亞當，斯密以來爲自由主義經濟大本營的曼徹斯特，講述自己的經濟學說。他的經濟學說，一言以蔽之。用共勞互助以代替自由主義經濟學者的自由競爭，他主張如孟子般國家應有扶養老人，保育無保護者的幼兒，補助貧者的義務。他從正面反對從十九世紀初期以來席捲英國的自由放任主義他的體論自然不容於當時。然而他平心靜氣地行其所信。他時常率領牛津的學生親自修繙牛津的道路。他又割愛自己所藏的珍品、以貢獻於牛津博物館的建立。他不喜歡使用熱汽力，例如他的著作，他更其要使他的門人設立出版所，一切用人工來完成。總而言之，他的文章，另有一種風趣，他的文恩，如泉之湧，汨汨不絕。</p>

<p>雖然像他這樣的人，他一生在懇愛上失敗了，在那方面他是一個完全的破產者。第一，他在自己的山莊招待繪地的肖像的書家密勒斯。那畫快要告成的時候，拉斯金夫人與密勒斯之間業已發生戀愛。夫人向法庭控訴拉斯金虐待。拉斯金對此幷不作任何辯護，因此，那女人脫離拉斯金而成爲密勒斯夫人。密勒斯所作名　中的模特兒，常照那女子描繪的。將近晚年時，他又愛上了某少女。少女對他也頗有意，然而那女子因宗敎信仰的不同，拉斯金所信奉的，並不和那女子一樣，因之，本拒絕談到婚事。</p>
<p>如此，拉斯金所過的生活極爲寂寞。然而英國人對他的意見，曾有不甚贊問者，但亦有不少人對他寄與同情學尊敬。拉斯金比加萊較爲女性化一點，然而他亦是一個熱血男子，對反對者便用過激的言辭。因此，巧妙地應用日本版畫之意匠的美國　家霍斯拉氏，控訴拉斯金的批計　損了自己的耳目。這判斷引起世間的騷擾，拉斯金的同情者送凍了一切費用。而向拉斯金宣判一文錢的賠償金。如此，霍斯拉氏在世界留下了一個笑柄。</p>
<p>風流才子王爾德</p>
<p>以上是維多利亞前期的話。至後期，如上所述那種人，幾乎絕跡了。自然，有梅萊狄斯，哈台等所謂大家者存在着。然而他們是古董的存在，支配一時的風氣者另有他人。從維多利亞朝的中期至末期、恰如斯威夫的海外軒渠錄中從大人國到小人國一樣。此中遮掩了美的生活之眞方向而出現的祗有一個奥斯卡·王爾德。王爾德剔除了拉斯金的眞與善而繼承了美的衣缽。自行打開了一條路。讀他的作品，妙語如珠，衝口而出，富於興味，但總之他是輕薄才子的首腦，當時耽溺頽廢的雰圍、可說是由他促進的，他並且是其代表。他因同性不倫事件，而被繫於獄，他的令譽暫告失　，而關顧他的人也極少。然可咎者豈僅他一人而已。使他擴充其羽翼的世人，亦應分担其責任。王爾德被視爲罪人而埋葬其一生時，世人多佯裝不知，這就是所謂英國式的僞善。（第二章完）（翔：譯自每日新聞）</p>

<p>滬法租界交還我國協定簽訂儀式舉行完畢後，我褚外長特發表談話如下</p>
<p>自國民政府參戰後，友邦日本首先以道義精神，聲明撤廢在華治外法權，並交還租界，此種懇摯之表示，我全國人民無不</p>
<p>衷心感動</p>
<p>嗣法國亦自動繼友邦日本之後。於本年二月二十三日聲明交還粗界，並撤廢治外法櫵。本年三月二十九日，即與我國外交部交換放棄北京使館區域內行政權之照會，本年四月八日又交換放棄鼓浪嶼公共租界內行政權之照會，本年五月十八日復簽訂交還津漢粵三地法租界行政權之實施細目協定，於是在華各法租界除上海外，均已交還。本月初旬本人在上海與駐華法大使會晤，對於交還上海法租界事作初步之洽商。本月十二日法代表團即來京、與我接收委員會各委員磋商實施細目協定，經數產折衝後，意見趨於一致。今日兩方代表已正式</p>
<p>簽訂協定</p>
<p>定於本月三十日舉行交還儀式，從此法國在華租界，均已完全交遼我國政府及全國人民。對於法國此種賢明及友誼之措置，銘感固不待言，而友邦日本首倡義舉，及此次鼎力斡旋，允爲我人所不能忘者也。上海爲我國經濟之樞紐，並爲東亞一大商埠，其地位之重要、自不待言。此次法租界之行政權適與上海公共租界之行政權在同一星期內交還，使百年來上海地方行政上之畸形制度，一旦肅淸，其影響於國際視聽者至大，共有裨於我主權之恢復者亦至鉅。　念租界之形成、實由於存在多年之不平等條約，國父遺敎諄諄以廢除不平等條約爲訓，我全國上下</p>
<p>祈求渴想</p>
<p>垂數十年。今賴國父在天之靈，得我最高領袖汪主席以崇高之人格作堅苦之奮鬥，故能感召友邦之同情，克遂復興之大業，本人承乏外交部長得預其事，良深欣幸。在此次談判過程巾，中法雙方代表互以友誼之諒解、及誠懇之態度，從事洽商，致今日得順利完成其任務，本人對之至爲欣佩，並預料此後中法兩國邦交益加增進也。</p>

<p>日本中央協力會議，於十六日最後一次會議上，由日本海軍部報道員田代中佐詳細說明南太平洋海戰近况，以下爲共演詞全文：</p>
<p>敵方猛烈反攻</p>
<p>所羅門羣島方面的戰局，自六月上旬以來，進入空軍決戰的階段。我方航空部隊對敵方的航空基地瓜島，魯塞爾島，及其他各地不時作航空兵力的擊滅戰，轟炸航空基地，及組斷其運輸。而敵機的前來襲擊的次數，亦日見激烈，平均每日有七十至八十架，至六日巾，下旬，寬增至每日百架左右，我方陸上部隊每决均予以重大的損失，然而敵方不顧一切，不斷補充，前來猛烈反攻。敵方的反攻，雖受到巨大的犧牲，重大的損失，但仍繼續不輟，可見敵人的企圖，決不是一時的，而是下了非常的決心轉取攻勢。因此，六月份的空戰，特別激烈。六月三十日，敵方航空部隊，巡洋艦、驅逐艦並商船十數艘，海上卡事，登陸用舟艇所組成的有力部際，突然出現於偷特巴島方面，其一切開始在該島登陸</p>
<p>壯烈的肉彈戰</p>
<p>我們於此略述以新佐治亞島爲中心的戰况：從地理上看來，我方基地拉浦耳與敵方基地瓜島的距離約六百哩的中間有普根比爾島，在此島與瓜島的中間有新佐治亞島。從形狀上看來，新佐治亞島恰如胡風形，頭在西北方，頭之下爲蒙達。離開頭的所在的七海里至十五海里的地方有蓮葉形的島是科隆奔伽拉島。距離胡瓜頭下的五海里的海面似雁首形者即是倫特巴島。在倫特巴島與新佐治亞島蒙達之間的是羅比安那島。現正以此方面爲中心而激戰中。</p>
<p>探知敵方在此登陸後，海軍航空部隊立即對之加以猛攻，擊沉擊毀運輪船六艘，巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦一艘，擊墜敵機七十七架以上，此次空戰中我方未返者三十一架。前决第一次所羅門海戰以來的大海戰南太平洋海戰中，朱返機有四十架，此次爲第二次的大犧牲。這航空部隊以肉彈攻擊的猛烈的戰鬥情况，我們不難想像得之。</p>
<p>水上機的勇戰</p>
<p>至七月一日，二日，敵人漸次從倫特巴島出現於新佐治亞島、三日，四日復出現於羅比安那島。至七月七日，敵的一部在蒙達南卞登陸，我對此攻擊的戰果，每次均經發表，其中想特別提出者，甚至於我方的水上機也突破敵陣，對敵陣地或驅逐艦船團的寄泊地，或敵方舟艇的巡弋塲所加以攻擊，而獲得戰果，水上機速力遲鈍，性能亦較敵P38型戰鬥機爲劣。是以每遇敵機追擊不捨而受攻擊時，常轉身取攻擊恣　而擊墜之。敵人現在到水上機也極恐懼。</p>
<p>水雷戰隊偉蹟</p>
<p>驅逐　攻　巡洋艦的奇蹟，曾在巴利島海戰中充分發揮了其敵鬥精神。至十二日，企圖在該方面登陸的敵方掩護部隊，計巡洋艦驅運艦十餘　，與我水雷戰隊交戰，擊沉敵巡洋艦二艘，一艘起火，此役我方亦有巡洋艦一艘重傷。是爲十二日的科隆奔伽拉島夜戰。十四日，敵從南北二面同時向蒙逮方面前進，我部隊即加以猛烈反攻，十四日朝，擊潰在蒙達東海岸水面施放烟幕前來攻擊的敵軍，猛烈的戰鬥，現正在進行中，敵的反攻企圖。的確相當强烈。我們準備誘引在蒙達束面登陸的敵人深入。而與以打擊，以粉碎敵的大規模反攻企圖，而使戰局有利地　　。（翔。譯自七月十七日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>接收租界委員會委員眞奇峯部長，於昨（廿二）日下午九時，廣播此次接收租界之感想，蘇錄全文如下：</p>
<p>諸位同胞：</p>
<p>自本年一月九日，我國參戰之後，友邦日木爲援助我國生權之恢復，首先與我國簽訂關於交還租界及撤廢治外法權之協定，組於三月三十日即國民政府還都三週年紀念日。交還全部日本在華專管租界，更協力向各國斡旋，順利接收各國共管的北京使館區域，及鼓浪嶼公共租界，日本此種舉動，其目光之宏遠，理想之正大，友誼之懇擊，魄力之偉毅，不特我們同生共死駢肩作戰於大東亞戰爭的中國人民非常感奮，即大束亞共築圈內的人民，及全世界主張人道正義的人士，無不感奮景仰，奉爲模範，關於此點，我們可以法國的行動來作證明。</p>
<p>法國當國家多事之時，環境緊張，萬機待理，但仍能認淸局勢，排除難關，於本年二月二十三日，自動聲明交還在華租界及撤慶治外法權，嗣後爾國政府各　代爽磋商實施細目，即於五月十八口簽訂協定，六月五日實行交還天津·漢口·安慶東·沙面三處之法鬨專管租界。彼時鄙人曾利用廣播，向　君報告經過，經此以後，法國在華租界僅　上海一處，尚未交還，我國朝野上下及報紙與論。均表示希望能與其他各處租界一併提早交還，事實上關於此事，兩國當局準備交涉迄未絲毫鬆懈，我國上海法租界幅員較廣，組織亦較複雜，所有調查擊理等各項準備手續，須費相當時間，本月初旬，鄙人偕外交部褚都長在上海與法國駐華大使戈思默閣下會晤，對於交還上海租界事，先採初步之洽商，規定原則，本月十二，法國代表全體到京，即由接收委員會諸委員進行折衝，逐日磋商，兩方意見歸於一致，今日已簽訂實施細目協定，定期舉行交還儀式，此後法國在華各租界遂得完全交還，一俟此次儀式舉行以後，接收委員會之任務，即告完畢。</p>
<p>人當此任務將告完成之際，覺迭次談判，得能順利圓滿，實由於法國政府對於友誼之眞誠，見事之明決，同時法代表諸君以懇摯之態度，作有益之折衝，吾人對之至深銘感。此外友邦日本始終斡旋，惠我允大，吾人誠不勝共感謝也。</p>
<p>上海爲我國經濟樞紐，亦爲東亞共榮團內一大商埤，地位之重要，不言可知，百年以來，英美帝國王義，以上海租界爲基礎，侵害我國之主權，妨礙我國之發展，在經濟上供共榨取，在文化上肆其麻醉，我國民痛心疾首，久欲收囘，戰以英美勢力盤踞其間，難於實現，幸賴友邦日本發動大東亞戰爭，將英美在東亞之侵略勢力根本廓淸，使東亞各民族獲得自由解放，我最高傾袖汪主席順應民意，燭照機先，毅然對英美宣戰，於是我國途爲參加大東亞戰爭之一國，而友邦日本即以熱誠援助找國恢復領土主權之完整，劇除侵略麻醉之護符，其他各友邦亦聞風　起。相率彷行，於是國父廢除不平等條約之遺志，與全國民衆多年熱烈之期望，均已一一實現。</p>
<p>我人試週溯上述事實之遞嬗，即知吾人於慶幸感謝領土主權復歸完整之隊，斷不可以慶幸感謝爲行動之止境，吾人此後更應服齊國父遺敎及最高領袖汪主席所昭示之大政方針，擁　汪主席領導全國民衆與友邦日本戮力同心，奮勇邁進，以抒展參加大束亞戰爭之抱負，貫澈大東亞戰爭之目的，庶幾束亞共榮之偉業，早得完成騙中國復與之宿　。終於克遂</p>
<p>接收委員會同仁，秉承政府訓示，辦理此事將告完成，私衷良爲欣幸，筆舌之勞，所不足數，茲當協定簽訂之日，用將經過情形。及所得感想。向全國同胞報告。</p>

<p>公共租界警務總監渡正監，昨對本月十八日南京路方九霞銀樓盜刦傷人案，發表談話如下：</p>
<p>以殺人罪依法</p>
<p>「七月十八日午後零時三十分，於老閘警署管轄內福建路附近發生之開槍殺人事件，當塲逮捕之犯人，經調查結果，判明係華人便服警官，此事實屬遺憾之至。當局除立予免職處分外，同時並提起訴手續。嗣後續作愼重調查，業已略有頭緒，以强盜殺人罪今（二十三）日解送特區法院，依中國法律予以處罰，警官中竟有如此不法人犯而致警察官一名，自警團員二名殉職。誠屬令人痛恨。鑒於本事件之發生，決意愈益振肅綱紀，進而副社會之付託。</p>
<p>自警殉職發揚精神</p>
<p>當逮捕本事件犯人時，印度警官之勇敢。固不待論，奮勇挺身發揮自警精神。而達成使命之自警團班長沈君荷淸，及自警團員扛　君等卓越之責任觀念，與崇高犧牲精神，可謂發於中國保甲自警之眞髓，大東亞戰爭勃發以來，以同甘共苦之精神，而育成之保甲自警團敎育實有今已燦爛開花結實之感。</p>
<p>崇高犧牲虔致悼惜</p>
<p>對殉職者崇高之犧牲，虔致悼惜。後日當按諸規程，賞其勳功，以誌永垂不杇。今後深望自警團員愈加鞏固團結，以確保治安，達成自警目的，乃至爲盼禱者也，」</p>

<p>— 王海波</p>
<p>木報近接各界來函，對助學金發抒桌見，具徵關心之切，用爲刊布，藉資韋佩。</p>
<p>申報爲協助失學靑年，獲得繼續求學之機會起見，舉辦助學金，已歷四屆，過去成績，博得社會之好評，此次爲第五屆助學運動開始，本屆收獲預期當然要超過往昔，按助學運動是一件最有意義的工作，大凡每一個靑年，都希望多謂幾年書，多求一點學問，以備他日出而問世，無如現在生活高漲，一班家長們，平日對於開門七件事，已覺難以應付，若再要支出一筆相當的學費，確是不容易的事，以學費的問題，而限制了靑年的向學途境，這是何等痛心的一件事，况淸寒子弟，往往很有優秀份子，所謂可造之材極多，而社會條件。偏使淸寒者，對求學發生向隅之歎，這更是痛心的一件事，有人說，在學校方面，不是可以普遍設立免費或减費的名額嗎？但是否人又要替學校　想，學校不是營業機關，無論公立私立，經費均有預算，而敎職員本來是很淸苦的，如果多數學生　都要免費减費，那麼學校經費，如何挹注，教職員生活不是又成了問題嗎？所謂「救了田鷄餓了蛇」，不是一個兩全的辦法，所以助學運動優點。就是旣可以嘉惠淸寒子弟，使之免除失學的痛苦，同時又使各學校，不受經濟的影響，雙方兼顧，一舉而兩美具，是値得稱頌的，吾人抱無限之同情，湯望社會各界人士，一致起來，踴躍輸將，以助其成，多一份助學金，即多栽培一人才，對於國家社會均有莫大裨益的</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3 id="c35">節約在上海！ <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>節約在上海是最迫切的，因爲上海是全國物資集中的倉庫，上消的物資能夠節的起來，全國的物資也就可以節約過半了；可是，節約在上海同時也是最困難的，因爲上海習於歐美「　事增華」的惡習，已經是根深蒂國，益以投機者流、對於金錢、絲毫不覺「來處不易」，「物力維艱」，於是都來一個，今朝有酒今朝醉的做法，一朝發財、便視金錢不甚愛惜、揮如泥沙。而社會奢糜之風，乃至愈演愈不像話！</p>
<p>所以，我們認爲節約運動的實踐，必須要從上面所說的一般人們做起，因爲他們沒有一個不是站在節的的反面。我們至少要奉勸他們一點：就是自身即使不能做到我們所理想的消費節的，也得要把他們所消費的一部份，甚至一小部份，節約起來，用於博施濟衆之舉，或以捐助貧寒，或以　濟老弱，倒也是差强人意的。</p>

<p>商統會的下層機構，計有二十二個聯合會，雖已全部成立，然其前途猶多困難，欲求其解決，唯有希望國府從加强政治力入手，其當前急務，的有左列數點：</p>
<p>（一）物價問題　關於物價問題，商統會唐理事長曾經發表談話，說明物價問題對策，應由商統會及其下層機構同業聯合會，同業公，等負其全責，但現今物價依然騰漲不已，外間盛傳：商統會下層機構之有力份子，有不少人參加投機囤積，故成盼能由商統會發動嚴厲肅淸此種不法分子，物資調查委員會彎刻正從事全面調查工作，又悉物資統制審議會駐滬辦事處，亦定於八月中成立，允盼商統會能早實行有效之物價政策。</p>
<p>（二）配給採辦問題　商統會下層機構中，收買工作最重要者，厥爲麥粉專姿會關係之小麥及其他，其採辦與配給較之其他主要商品，尚稱順利，一般物價，較商統曾成立之時，的漲二倍，而製粉關係之漲風極少，此可請商統會工作之初步成功。</p>
<p>（三）令融間題　商統會曾向中央儲備銀行簽訂十萬萬元借款，作爲收買小麥之用，如仍不敷，尚將續訂貸款契約，故採辦小麥之資金。大體不至感覺短少。</p>
<p>（四）物資調查問題　物資調查，自本月十三日起開始，暫時以先查棉紗棉布爲限，站在民間自治團體立塲之商統會，當然不須推派調查官與調查員。惟該會上次調查竣事之棉紗棉布記錄，除送交調查委員會供其參考外，關於處理物資方法等，必要時向關係當局提供意見，盡量予以協力、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c43">節約與增產 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 樂秀良</p>
<p>物價的狂漲，迫使每一個中下階層的市民，部喊出了生活不易的呼聲。在這個烽烟遍及全世界的時候，物資缺乏和物價高漲的現象，是每個國家都免不了的。迎着我們的，也許還要艱苦，爲了適應環境，爲了迎接更艱苦的階段，我們都應該切實的來厲行節的，同時要厲行增產。</p>
<p>節約—雖然每個人都知道，却是說來容易實行却難的事情推其原因，總不外乎自信心薄弱和處榮心濃厚的緣故，譬如說衣吧，在這個「只重衣衫」的社會上，爲了敷衍門面，不得不講究，寗願家徒四壁，出門必須衣冠楚楚。俗齡說：「身上綢翩翩，家裏沒有夜飯米」這就是敷衍門面的虛榮心濃厚的寫眞。我們應指出這是錯誤的，我們不否認這個社會上有只重衣衫的現象，然而我們却不必爲了一般人們的「歧視和冷待而不惜變質典賣來裝飾自己，我們應該用眞正的才能，去獲得人們的尊敬，不需要用漂亮的衣着，硬撐面子。</p>
<p>再說食的問題！誰都知道在這個糧食問題已趨極端嚴重的階段，一般中下之家，都已是節撫可節，但是不可否認的，一席數千金，甚至一席萬金的現象，還普通於燈紅酒綠，笙　悠抑的大飯店，大酒樓中，「富家一席酒，窮人半年糧」，而現在更是「富人」席酒，災胞命十條」了，我們希望富有之家，能自覺的來實行節約。</p>
<p>關於「行」的問題：應提倡安步當車，不但節省車資，並可視作運動。</p>
<p>總之在這個艱苦的時代中，我們都應該力求節的，不慕虛榮。「硬撑塲面愛講面子」大可不必。</p>
<p>不過除了消極的節的外，我們更應該積極的做到「增加生產」，使物資的供求相平衡。</p>
<p>原料缺乏，運輸不便，這些都是阻碍增加生產的因素之一，然而因爲開工支浩大、維持困難，請人製造出來的貨物，却了不及囤積原料的更容易賺錢，試問避重就輕，誰不樂爲呢？</p>
<p>爲了增加生產，我們希望當局應該斷然的取締囤積，並保障正當的工商業的發城，盡可能給予種種業務上的便利。</p>
<p>總之，投機囤積一日不取締，則正當企業無從發展，增加生產亦只成紙上文章，一昧抹煞事實苛貴辦實業的無遠見，或者不顧現實只求辦實業的能自愛，同樣是錯誤的，是不合理的。</p>
<p>在這個時候，來提倡節約物資與增加生產，是急不待緩的工作，我們希望社會上的有識之士熱烈倡導，以身作則，切實做到，使這個運動，不致變成空洞的具文，和停留在識論和口號上面。</p>
<h3 id="c44">徐家匯聖母院訪問記（二） <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>嬰兒的生活</p>
<p>綠草地的兩端，對峙着兩埭古老的洋樓，由於時常修整粉飾，看不出是七十四年前的建築物，據說，在前年，曾經計劃好翻造新厦，一切已籌備妥當。可惜十二月八日太平洋戰爭爆發，不克實現。現在這所古厦，分劃爲孤嬰的臥室，前後各有七房。孩子們各有自己的吊艇式小銅牀，一律掛着珠羅紗的小蚊帳，毯蓆毛巾被等，都很整潔，有的尚在睡眠，有的由Sister在　牛奶。幾乎個個都肥碩活潑，尤其那一羣三四歲的，更是天眞可愛，個個淸秀美麗。記者不桀嘆息目前中等之家的小孩，也決不能享受如此生活？但是，金姆姆說：「幾個月前，個個都是面黃肌瘦，實在營養不足，撫育的姆姆阿姐們，幾乎沒有一天不對這些可憐的小孩掉淚？幸虧貧病救濟協會一再補助，恢復了牛奶鷄蛋的供喂，才又肥白紅潤像今天這樣呢」？</p>
<p>孤嬰到四五歲時，即受幼稚院敎育，依一定的時間，講談，遊戲，飲食，休息。孩子們有小汽車，脚踏車，木馬，滑梯等各種各樣玩具。爲了孩子們一進院就和外界隔絕，特備各種掛圖和模型，讓她們獲得關於輸船火車汽車及飛機等等新知識。每天除二粥一飯外，並有點心一次。中飯後例須午睡，睡醒即至花園散步。孩子們的日常生活，都由修女姆姆及孤兒中年長老在旁監護，完全依照衛生及敎育原理，比一般母姊之待子女弟妹，更要親切而合理，什麼炳，賭，酒以及不良言辭，更絕無知聞，在擾美的環境與合理的教養中，都能保養其良簪的天性。對於外間年齡稍長的孤女。即隔別收養，他們（現約五十餘人）另有臥室三大間，膳堂一間，與自幼進院的孤女隔處，男孤兒到五歲以上，就送入土山灣孤兒院。因此，聖母院孤嬰的生活，完全是練潔天眞而合理的。</p>
<p>工作與學習合一，生活即是教育，聖母院裏的孤兒早在實踐了。這裏的教育，可以分爲兩個部門：第一，普通敎育，一般孤女，到了六七歲，修畢幼稚園敎育後，就授以公敎敎育，由初級小學至高級小學，除了語·文·史·地·算·書等學科之外，同時敎她們各種家事，如整理床舖臥室，灑掃課堂作塲及飯間，抹桌洗碗以及廚房內的洗滌烹飪，庭園內的栽植澆灌等等，隨時加以敎導實習，並使年長者照顧年幼者，幫助她們工作與學習，彷彿所謂「小先生制」。同時，又按孤女的天賦能力，分別使學剌繡，花邊，縫衣，紡織等等工藝，以備出院後處身社會，能自食其力，不作社會的寄生蟲。</p>
<p>第二，對於殘疾孤女，這不幸中之不幸者，也分別授以適當的教育，特別値得誇耀的是聾啞敎育之認眞，先以法文字母，敎之出音，助以手勢，再逐漸敎之識字，讀書，作文。到三四年後，就可和別人談話，口音淸楚，聽者容易了解，到五六年後。便可與不啞者相較了。現有啞者十八人，分班敎學，每一敎師最多只敎四人，已經辛苦不堪。參觀時適値暑假，而啞生仍在上課，一位姆姆口手並用地各別敎導着，一個七八歲的啞女，在黑版上寫出「歡迎貴賓參觀，我們都是沒有父母的孤女」她們還能夠囘答記者的問題，而敎師之辛勤忍耐，更使人感動，在該院每一工塲，幾乎均有聾啞女子，成績都値得贊嘆？</p>
<p>孤女中天資及向學心特別優越的，就可升學深造。現在約有三十個孤女寄讀於徐家匯附小，有一個在中學求學，還有一班正趁暑期，特聘女敎師補敎英文等，以便秋季考入中學後獲得較優的學分。修女們對於孤女前途之重祝愛護，眞和親生的女兒一樣？</p>
<p>工塲合托兒所</p>
<p>爲着敎導孤女們學習維持生活的技藝，爲着出嫁後的孤女因生活之需要而進院工作。聖母院育嬰堂特在院內開設幾個工塲，計有刺繡所，在邊間，縫紉作，絨綫間，洗衣塲和修舊室等等，並爲適應女工友們的實際需要而開設小規模的托兒所，現在刺繡所有外來女工三十三人，孤女十名，刺繡各種花卉鳥獸山水照相等大小　件，大都爲各界所預定的，記者看到已經繡好的禮軸中，有一幅在人名三字內刺繡五彩山水，人物，非常精美，多數繡品，可以妣美長沙湘潭一帶所見湘繡，絕非市上賣品之粗俗可比。花邊問現有外來女★■■十七人孤女三人，代結被單，枕套，★■毯，餐巾，茶巾，手帕，婦孺服裝等，凡是讚美汕頭花邊工藝品的來看■■裏的出品，一定要驚嘆孤女啞者們的手工多麼細緻和精美呢★縫紉間外來女★有二十八人，孤女二名，有不少新式的縫衣機，都在緊張的★作中，大都是各方的定貨。洗衣塲的範圍一也不小，分洗漿和熨摺★★部，水糟及電熨的設備，極稱完善。此外，尚有絨綫間，修舊部等，適應目前社會的需要，專代修補衣服襪子絨綫編織物等。設有編結機。製襪機，搖紗機等新式★具★現在絨綫間有外來女★★★名，孤女★十名，洗衣及修舊問有外來女工四十五名，孤女四卞■★名★年長的孤女已在敎育幼女工作，技藝純熟，不讓工廠技師。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Air Defense Drills and Citizen Responsibility <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since yesterday, our city has begun conducting summer public air defense exercises. The significance of these exercises lies not only in training air defense baojia (neighborhood units) and local security personnel in various air defense tasks, but especially in enabling the general public to become accustomed to air defense life, to familiarize themselves with various air defense rules, to strictly adhere to discipline, and to help each other.</p>
<p>Although society has experienced air defense exercises before, there are still quite a few people who hold erroneous views. The first type has never seen actual warfare since the incident and regards Shanghai as a haven of peace, living as if in peacetime. Due to this mistaken notion, they are indifferent to air defense drills, at most considering them a novelty, remaining aloof. Thus, on the nights of air defense exercises, restaurants and dance halls are particularly lively. The second type harbors an excessive fear of air defense drills, even becoming neurotic, believing that the exercises are a prelude to an actual air raid. Therefore, whenever there is an air defense exercise, they express excessive tension, staying indoors and refraining from lighting lamps at night, seemingly complying with the law, but actually missing the point of conducting the exercises. Furthermore, there is a third type who holds half-baked military knowledge and political understanding, either misunderstanding that Shanghai has no high mountains or deep caves and no reliable air raid shelters, rendering air defense ineffective, or misunderstanding that air defense is entirely the concern of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, having nothing to do with us ordinary citizens. If these erroneous ideas are not fundamentally dispelled, they will have a negative impact on the effectiveness of air defense exercises.</p>
<p>The international war situation is approaching a decisive stage. Although our ally Japan is in a superior position in the battles in the Pacific, the enemy's ambition has never been abandoned. In terms of strength, the enemy has no possibility of counterattacking, but we cannot dismiss the concern of aerial guerrilla warfare. China is a participating country, and every citizen has the obligation of a participating national. Whether you are willing or not, the enemy's invasion is inevitable. Therefore, every citizen should have the necessary vigilance and preparation. Therefore, during air defense exercises, adopting the mindset of an actual air raid, earnestly understanding and complying with all air defense laws and regulations, and strictly observing order during the exercises are our most basic responsibilities. At the same time, during air defense exercises, we hope that baojia personnel and air defense commanders, in addition to faithfully performing their duties and striving to serve, should gently advise and explain in detail to those who violate the rules, and strictly deal with stubborn individuals who refuse to listen to advice according to the law.</p>
<p>Air defense exercises are an education in wartime life for the people and a test of the character of the national psyche. We hope that everyone will respect themselves and others, and everywhere demonstrate the spirit of self-governance and mutual assistance, and even outside of exercise periods, always be prepared and vigilant.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Summer Hygiene Matters <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>This summer, the climate is extremely abnormal, but as a result, some people neglect summer hygiene issues, which can easily lead to illness. The weather has gradually become hot these past few days. Although the authorities in charge are actively working on public health, such as epidemic prevention and sanitation, given the vastness of Shanghai's area, the density of its population, and the decline in the economic strength of the general public, maintaining public health and well-being still depends on the individual attention of citizens.</p>
<p>First of all, in terms of diet, due to the soaring prices recently, there have been extremely unhygienic phenomena in the market. (1) Families with relatively ample economic means are desperately hoarding rice, flour, grains, and other foods. After this year's particularly long rainy season, most have become infested with insects and have changed in quality. (2) Middle and lower-class restaurants, greedy for cheap prices and profits, not only hoard food but also use inferior and stale goods, showing no regard for the health of their customers. (3) Middle and lower-class families, given the high prices, indiscriminately eat coarse and spoiled food, knowingly consuming fermented stale food and food infested with flies, and are unwilling to discard it. This phenomenon not only affects individual health but also greatly harms public health. On the one hand, we hope that the authorities will strictly inspect the hygiene conditions of all restaurants and cold drink and food stalls. On the other hand, we urge citizens to advise each other that the harm of indiscriminate eating is greater than starvation, and to be especially vigilant about outside food and cold food. Refusing meat and fishy foods and cold foods, and not hoarding food, are of great benefit to frugality and the national economy.</p>
<p>The housing of the general population in this city is already overcrowded, and private and public hygiene are in a state of neglect. The purpose of ordinary sub-landlords is only to collect more rent, and they do not fulfill their responsibilities for household hygiene at all. Ordinary tenants, either due to ignorance or lack of cooperation, take no responsibility for the cleanliness and hygiene of the same house, the same alley, or the same street. The pigeonhole-like rooms, the disorderly disposal of filth, the foul smell, and the swarms of bedbugs, mosquitoes, and flies have become a widespread phenomenon. In some quieter places, excrement from people and animals is visible everywhere on the main roads. As for spitting everywhere, it has returned to its old state. As a result, public health is greatly affected. We hope that baojia and self-defense corps will come out to guide and advise, and we also hope that each head of household and tenant will spontaneously organize hygiene inspections, cooperate and help each other, and launch a clean and hygienic movement.</p>
<p>In addition to active epidemic prevention and sanitation campaigns, we cannot help but express our greatest regret over certain phenomena in this city. The first is the trend of hoarding medicines, regardless of the nature and efficacy of the medicines, simply hoarding them and selling them at inflated prices. Often, very ordinary medicines are priced like gold, even creating a shortage in the market. Some medicines, due to the expiration of their effectiveness, are still useless for treatment even when bought at high prices, and there are also instances of shoddy workmanship and counterfeiting of medicines. The threat to the health of citizens is greater than this. The second is the high medical fees charged by some hospitals and a few doctors, which often exceed the general price level. This is not a problem for the rich, but it is unbearable for the general public, so that the number of people who dare not seek medical attention when they are sick is increasing day by day. As for the perfunctory and negligent attitude of some doctors in diagnosing and caring for ordinary patients, and the free practice of medicine by a few doctors with no knowledge or experience, it is an even more dangerous phenomenon today. For all these, in addition to hoping for the proper handling of the relevant authorities, we earnestly hope that all colleagues will conduct self-examination and that the general public will boldly report them.</p>

<p>Joint Communiqué Issued by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Publicity</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Publicity issued the following joint communiqué on July 22:</p>
<p>According to the stipulations of the French government's declaration of February 23 this year regarding the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions, in order to implement the recovery of the administrative rights of the Shanghai French Concession, the signing ceremony for the agreement on detailed implementation terms and understanding matters was held at Ningyuan Building in the National Government at 11:00 AM this morning. The national flags of China and France were hung high at the entrance of Ningyuan Building and in the conference room, fluttering in the wind, further demonstrating solemnity and greatness and symbolizing the bright future of the two countries. The representatives of both sides arrived successively shortly after 10:00 AM. The Chinese attendees were Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Receiving Committee Minister Xia Qifeng, Ambassador Wu Kaisheng, Ambassador Wu Songgao, Vice Minister Zhou Longxiang, and Director Lu Runzhi. The observers were Secretary-General Zhang Jianchu, Division Chiefs Wang Huaifen and Chen Guofeng, Secretaries Xu Yizong and Commissioners Qu Sunyi and Wang Weifeng. The French attendees were Plenipotentiary Representative Consul-General Bosson, Consul-General Magre, and Consul Maichang. The observers were Secretary Bafar Shabuplan Bixu. At 11:00 AM sharp, the members of the committee and the observers of both sides took their seats in turn. Foreign Minister Chu stood up and announced the beginning of the signing ceremony, and the atmosphere in the entire venue was unusually solemn. First, Secretary-General Zhang of our Receiving Committee began to read the list of our committee members, and Secretary Bafar of the French Plenipotentiary Delegation began to read the list of French representatives. Then, Secretary-General Zhang began to read the Chinese text of the agreement, followed by Secretary Bafar reading the French text of the agreement.

<h3 id="e4">Full Text of Speeches by Chinese and French Representatives <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession was returned to our country, and the signing ceremony of the agreement was held in Nanjing on the morning of the 22nd. The following is the text of the speech by Consul Bosson of France and the reply by Foreign Minister Chu of our country:</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu's Reply</p>
<p>It is a great honor for me to be the chairman of the signing ceremony of the agreement on the return of the Shanghai French Concession today. Although France is in a difficult period, it resolutely implemented the declaration of February 23 this year at the earliest possible time, and successively returned the administrative rights of the Beijing Dongjiaominxiang Legation Quarter, the Gulangyu International Settlement, and the French Concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Now, the agreement on the return of the administrative organs of the Shanghai French Concession has been signed. We are sincerely grateful for this wise measure and expression of friendship. From the beginning of this negotiation, the representatives of both sides had mutual understanding and a spirit of peace, so there were no major difficulties in the negotiation process, and they were able to smoothly complete their mission. I respectfully express my admiration on behalf of the government. Regarding the Shanghai French Concession, which is about to be returned, the Chinese government will develop it into a city that is envied by the world. Under the new system, the French people do not have to worry about their future, and they will continue to be protected by us, so that the inherent friendship between China and France will not be affected. As for charitable and cultural undertakings in the concession, we will also try to develop them more and more, and the subsidies will continue to be maintained, because these undertakings are of great benefit to the communication and closeness of Chinese and French cultures. Finally, I firmly believe that the agreement signed today will be the cornerstone of our future relations and will enhance the inherent friendship between China and France.</p>
<p>Consul Bosson's Speech</p>
<p>One of the most important points of the French government's declaration of February 23, 1943, has been implemented through the agreement signed just now. The French authorities are now returning the administrative rights of the Shanghai French Concession, which has a history of nearly a hundred years, to China, and are confident that this valuable measure will be recognized and valued by China. The Shanghai Municipality and the vast area of the French Concession are of great importance in the history of the increasingly close and prosperous relations between China and other countries in the world. For a hundred years, this has been a major commercial port, a hub of commerce and finance, which has enabled China to occupy a significant position in the world economy. France dares not boast that it has done its best to help build this great city, but on the occasion of returning the administrative rights it has long assumed, it is fortunate to be able to transfer the great buildings and the model equipment and organization that can be compared to modern cities to China free of charge. We are confident that under the new system of management in Shanghai, the cooperative enterprises established in the French Concession will be able to take into account the common interests of the people of both countries. The representatives of the two countries conducted various negotiations in a spirit full of friendship, and did not focus solely on economic or practical issues. The agreement of July 22, 1983, based on the importance of cultural and charitable undertakings, can further promote the cultural cooperation between the two countries, which has had a special nature for centuries up to the present day. What is even more important is that in this new era in history, China and France should take moral spirit as the first priority and maintain the customs and traditions that have contributed greatly to the evolution of civilization in the world, and the two sides should work together to transmit and restore the inherent glory in spirit, science, and knowledge in the future. I would like to congratulate the future of the two countries with this belief, and I firmly believe that the Sino-French cooperative undertaking presided over by Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Chu Minyi will become more and more prosperous, and I wish the friendship between China and France will become more and more consolidated.</p>

<p>— A Dandy Ruskin</p>
<p>There is another person worth remembering in the Victorian era, and that is Ruskin. Ruskin was most influenced by Carlyle, and even if someone said that he was Carlyle's disciple, he would not express dissatisfaction. However, he had his own unique position. He was the only son of a wine merchant in London, loved by his parents beyond measure, a so-called dandy. The temperament of a dandy did not change until he died at the age of eighty-odd. He was known to the world as a critic of painting. Part of his great work "Modern Painters" was written during his time at Oxford University, which shows that he was precocious.</p>
<p>Compared to Carlyle, he has extremely fine senses of beauty. He looks at wildflowers and clouds as the infinite beauty of the universe. He advocates that truth, goodness, and beauty must be combined to be called beauty. The beauty he speaks of contains goodness, goodness contains truth, and truth contains beauty. These truths, goodness, and beauty are consistent for him, and he often summarizes them as beauty. Therefore, he does not want to satisfy himself with a virtuous life alone, but also takes care of others. Here, although he greatly opposes socialism, he also considers himself a friend of the workers. He personally built St. George's Hall, established a hall for the workers, and personally gave lectures. This shows one aspect of him.</p>
<p>He is not satisfied with the criticism of painters such as Daye, and he goes on to establish his personal economics. He went to Manchester, which has been the stronghold of liberal economics since Adam Smith, to lecture on his economic theories. His economic theories can be summarized in one sentence: using mutual labor and cooperation to replace the free competition of liberal economists. He advocates that, like Mencius, the state should have the obligation to support the elderly, nurture orphans without protection, and subsidize the poor. He opposes head-on the laissez-faireism that has swept England since the early 19th century. His theories are naturally unacceptable at that time. However, he calmly and quietly does what he believes in. He often leads Oxford students to personally repair the roads of Oxford. He also donates the treasures he has collected to the establishment of the Oxford Museum. He does not like to use steam power. For example, for his works, he wants his disciples to establish a publishing house and complete everything manually. In short, his articles have a unique sense of humor, and his literary grace is like a spring gushing out endlessly.</p>

<p>— ——Tokutomi Roka</p>
<p>Although he was such a person, he failed in love throughout his life. In that aspect, he was a complete bankrupt. First, he invited Millais, the painter who portrayed Ai Li's portrait, to his villa. When the painting was about to be completed, Ruskin's wife and Millais had already fallen in love. The wife sued Ruskin for abuse in court. Ruskin did not make any defense, so the woman left Ruskin and became Mrs. Millais. The model in Millais' famous works was often depicted according to that woman. Near the end of his life, he fell in love with a certain young girl again. The girl was also quite interested in him, but the woman refused to talk about marriage because of the difference in religious beliefs. What Ruskin believed in was not the same as what the woman believed in.</p>
<p>Thus, Ruskin lived a very lonely life. However, the British people had opinions about him that were not very approving, but many people also sympathized with and respected him. Ruskin is a little more feminine than Carlyle, but he is also a hot-blooded man, and he uses radical words to criticize opponents. Therefore, Whistler, the American painter who skillfully applied the design of Japanese prints, sued Ruskin for criticism that damaged his reputation. This judgment caused a stir in the world, and Ruskin's sympathizers donated all the expenses. Ruskin was sentenced to pay a penny in damages. Thus, Whistler left a laughing stock in the world.</p>
<p>The Romantic Dandy Oscar Wilde</p>
<p>The above is about the early Victorian period. In the later period, as mentioned above, such people almost disappeared. Naturally, there were so-called masters such as Meredith and Hardy. However, they were relics of the past, and there was someone else who dominated the atmosphere of the time. From the mid-Victorian era to the late Victorian era, it was like Gulliver's Travels, from the land of giants to the land of little people. Here, only Oscar Wilde obscured the true direction of the beautiful life. Wilde eliminated Ruskin's truth and goodness and inherited the mantle of beauty. He opened up a path on his own. Reading his works, witty remarks come out of his mouth, which are full of interest. But in short, he is the leader of the frivolous dandies. It can be said that he promoted the decadent atmosphere at that time, and he is also its representative. He was imprisoned for homosexual impropriety, his reputation was temporarily lost, and few people cared about him. But can only he be blamed? The people who allowed him to spread his wings should also share the responsibility. When Wilde was regarded as a sinner and buried his life, most people pretended not to know. This is so-called English hypocrisy. (End of Chapter Two) (Xiang: Translated from Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3 id="e7">France Returns Shanghai French Concession: Foreign Minister Chu's Statement <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Following the completion of the signing ceremony for the agreement on the return of the Shanghai French Concession to China, Foreign Minister Chu issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Since the National Government joined the war, our friendly nation, Japan, first demonstrated a spirit of righteousness by declaring the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions. This sincere expression deeply moved all of our people.</p>
<p>Subsequently, France also voluntarily followed the example of our friendly nation, Japan. On February 23rd of this year, it declared the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. On March 29th of this year, it exchanged notes with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the relinquishment of administrative power within the Beijing Legation Quarter. On April 8th of this year, it further exchanged notes regarding the relinquishment of administrative power within the Kulangsu International Settlement. On May 18th of this year, it signed an agreement on the detailed implementation of the return of administrative power over the French concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Thus, all French concessions in China, except for Shanghai, have already been returned. At the beginning of this month, I met with the French Ambassador to China in Shanghai for preliminary discussions on the return of the Shanghai French Concession. On the 12th of this month, the French delegation came to Nanjing and consulted with the members of our Receiving Committee regarding the detailed implementation agreement. After several rounds of negotiations, opinions converged. Today, representatives from both sides have formally</p>
<p>signed the agreement,</p>
<p>stipulating that the handover ceremony will be held on the 30th of this month. From then on, all French concessions in China will be completely returned to our government and people. We are deeply grateful for France's wise and friendly measures, and we will never forget our friendly nation, Japan, for initiating this righteous act and providing strong mediation this time. Shanghai is the economic hub of our country and a major commercial port in East Asia. The importance of its position is self-evident. The fact that the administrative power of the French Concession and the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement are being returned within the same week will once and for all eliminate the abnormal system of local administration in Shanghai that has existed for a century. Its impact on international perception is significant, and its contribution to the restoration of our sovereignty is enormous. The formation of concessions was due to the unequal treaties that existed for many years. The teachings of our Founding Father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, emphasized the abolition of unequal treaties. Our entire nation has been</p>
<p>longing and yearning</p>
<p>for this for decades. Now, thanks to the spirit of our Founding Father in heaven and the arduous struggle of our supreme leader, Chairman Wang Jingwei, with his noble character, we have been able to inspire the sympathy of friendly nations and achieve the great cause of revival. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, I am deeply honored to have participated in this event. During the negotiation process, the representatives of China and France engaged in discussions with mutual understanding and a sincere attitude, resulting in the smooth completion of their mission today. I am deeply impressed by this and anticipate that the friendly relations between China and France will be further enhanced in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Observations from Tokyo Political Circles on the Scheduled Return of the French Concession <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to observers in Tokyo's political circles, the return of the Shanghai French Concession by France indicates that the Japanese government earnestly hopes that China can achieve autonomy and complete integrity. Therefore, after the previous return of the exclusive concessions, it signed an agreement with the National Government on June 30th regarding the return of administrative power over the Shanghai International Settlement, which is scheduled to be implemented on August 1st. The Japanese government's fundamental administrative policy for Greater East Asia is based entirely on righteousness, and it sincerely hopes that all countries concerned with China will also adopt the same attitude as Japan. In particular, the date of implementation of the return of the Shanghai French Concession, which is the same as the Shanghai International Settlement, is highly anticipated by all parties. Now that China and France have signed an agreement in Nanjing today regarding the return of the Shanghai French Concession, and it will be implemented two days earlier than the International Settlement, it can be said that China's century-long aspiration for self-reliance and independence since the Opium War has been realized. The rapid development of the National Government's politics and economy in the future is deeply anticipated. From Japan's perspective, it is deeply fortunate for China. It is natural for the French government to take the same measures as Japan in terms of friendly relations between Japan and France. The resolute attitude of the French government in resolutely implementing the return of the Shanghai French Concession under these complex international circumstances is truly commendable. All of this has a great impact on the promotion of the construction of Greater East Asia and on all countries in the world, including the enemy, Britain and the United States.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Algiers: The headquarters of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa issued a communique on the 21st, stating that elite German troops have successively arrived in Sicily for reinforcement.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - After the Axis forces in Sicily severely damaged the U.S.-Canadian joint forces on the 20th, in order to avoid being surrounded by superior enemy forces, they have withdrawn from Enna and Caltanissetta in the central part of the island. There is no significant change in the situation in the Catania lowlands in the east. On the 21st, the German authorities expressed their views on the situation on the island as follows: The most noteworthy aspect of the current situation in Sicily is the increased resistance of the Axis forces in the eastern coastal area. The British Eighth Army, with its powerful tanks and infantry units, under the cover of naval artillery fire, is attempting to advance forcefully, but its advance has been completely blocked by the Axis forces. The fighting in the eastern coastal area has entered a stalemate. In contrast, the fighting in the central and western regions has made considerable progress due to the flexible defense tactics adopted by the Axis forces. The Axis air force is also active in the eastern and southern regions of Sicily, cooperating with ground forces in the fighting in the Caltanissetta and Enna regions, carrying out low-altitude bombing and inflicting heavy damage on the U.S. mechanized supply units. They also bombed British positions in the Licata area and shot down five Spitfire enemy aircraft in the Catania lowlands, strafing the U.S.-Canadian joint forces with machine guns.</p>
<p>Heavy Air Raid on Malta</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Major Freytag, Air Defense Officer of the German News Agency, stated: On the night before July 20th, a group of Axis bombers raided Valetta Harbor on the island of Malta, which is the main base for British and American operations in Sicily. Axis reconnaissance aircraft confirmed that the entire port area, especially the port itself, suffered significant damage. According to reconnaissance aircraft reports, two freighters totaling 18,000 tons were sunk, with only the masts remaining. Two other merchant ships totaling 15,000 tons were severely damaged by explosions and fire. A 5,000-ton ship was severely damaged on one side and caught fire, and its loss is almost certain. In addition, four merchant ships and transport ships totaling 21,000 tons were hit in many places and injured. The fires on each of these ships continued to spread for several hours after the attack. Although the enemy's fighter and anti-aircraft defenses were strong, the Axis forces lost only one aircraft, and the rest returned to their base.</p>

<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Haishentong Agency, news from here last night: The Soviet troops on Vardo Island attempted to land in Norway with 40 to 60 ships. On the night of the 19th, the Soviet troops took advantage of the dense fog and planned to land in Vadsø Bay, Norway, from Vadsø and Nyborg. However, they were discovered in time by the German troops along the coast. The landing ships were protected by light warships. When they were within the range of the German artillery, the German artillery opened fire, and at least ten Soviet ships were sunk and many were injured.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Situation on the Eastern Front <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - Colonel Hama, military correspondent for the German News Agency, stated: In the great defensive battle on the Eastern Front, the Orel region is gradually becoming the central point. Although the Soviet troops have added strong units to the fighting in the central part of the Mius and Donets, it is clear that the Soviet troops want to complete the decisive battle of their summer offensive in the Orel region. The original plan of the Soviet telegram must have been more ambitious. The enemy planned to advance northwest from Kursk in an attempt to threaten the entire central front of the German army. However, the counterattack launched by the German army on July 5th resulted in the annihilation of three Soviet divisions, causing the Soviet army's plan to fail completely, and forcing the military actions of the Soviet army to be limited to the Orel region. The Soviet army concentrated its tank reserves and heavy weapons in this area in an attempt to break through the German line at any cost and regardless of any losses. Within the area where a German infantry division was stationed, it was possible to see no less than three battalions of Soviet tanks. These tanks had just arrived a few days ago and bombarded the German line all day from morning to night on Tuesday. On Tuesday, the Soviet army lost 133 tanks in this area. Although the Soviet army suffered heavy losses, the result was only to create a few local indentations in the German line, and these indentations were soon filled by local German reserves, cutting off Soviet communications and making it impossible for them to carry out operations with a large number of troops.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Recent Situation of Naval Battles in the South Pacific <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>At the last meeting on the 16th of the Japan Central Cooperation Conference, Lieutenant Commander Tashiro, a reporter from the Japanese Navy, gave a detailed explanation of the recent situation of naval battles in the South Pacific. The following is the full text of the joint speech:</p>
<p>Fierce Enemy Counterattack</p>
<p>Since the beginning of June, the battle situation in the Solomon Islands area has entered the stage of air force decisive battle. Our air force has been carrying out air force annihilation battles against the enemy's air bases on Guadalcanal, Russell Island, and other places from time to time, bombing air bases and blocking their transportation. The number of enemy aircraft coming to attack has also become more intense, averaging 70 to 80 aircraft per day, and increasing to about 100 aircraft per day in the middle and late parts of June. Our land forces have inflicted heavy losses on each decisive battle. However, the enemy disregards everything and constantly replenishes, launching fierce counterattacks. Although the enemy's counterattacks have suffered huge sacrifices and heavy losses, they continue unabated, indicating that the enemy's attempt is by no means temporary, but rather a very determined offensive. Therefore, the air battles in June were particularly fierce. On June 30th, the enemy's air force, cruisers, destroyers, and a dozen or so merchant ships, maritime cargo carriers, and a powerful division composed of landing craft suddenly appeared in the area of Tutuba Island, and began landing on that island.</p>
<p>Heroic Human Bullet Warfare</p>
<p>Here we will briefly describe the battle situation centered on New Georgia Island: Geographically speaking, the distance between our base Rabaul and the enemy's base Guadalcanal is about 600 miles, with Bougainville Island in the middle. Between this island and Guadalcanal is New Georgia Island. In terms of shape, New Georgia Island is like a gourd shape, with the head in the northwest and Munda below the head. Seven to fifteen nautical miles from the location of the head is a lotus leaf-shaped island called Kolombangara Island. The sea surface five nautical miles from the bottom of the gourd head is the Rentaba Island, which resembles the head of a wild goose. Between Rentaba Island and Munda on New Georgia Island is Robiana Island. The fierce battle is currently centered on this area.</p>
<p>After learning that the enemy had landed there, the naval air force immediately launched a fierce attack on them, sinking and destroying six transport ships, three cruisers, and one destroyer, and shooting down more than 77 enemy aircraft. 31 of our aircraft did not return in this air battle. In the great naval battle in the South Pacific since the first Solomon Sea battle, 40 aircraft did not return. This was the second major sacrifice. We can easily imagine the fierce battle situation in which the air force attacked with human bullets.</p>
<p>Brave Battle of Seaplanes</p>
<p>From July 1st to 2nd, the enemy gradually appeared from Rentaba Island to New Georgia Island. On the 3rd and 4th, they reappeared at Robiana Island. On July 7th, part of the enemy landed on the south side of Munda. The results of our attacks on this have been announced each time. Among them, what I want to particularly mention is that even our seaplanes broke through the enemy's lines and attacked the enemy's positions or the anchorage of the destroyer fleet, or the patrol area of the enemy's boats, and achieved results. The speed of the seaplanes is slow and their performance is inferior to that of the enemy's P38 fighter planes. Therefore, whenever they are pursued and attacked by enemy aircraft, they often turn around and attack and shoot them down. The enemy is now extremely afraid of seaplanes.</p>
<p>Great Achievements of the Mine Warfare Squadron</p>
<p>The miracle of the destroyer attacking the cruiser has fully demonstrated its fighting spirit in the Battle of Bali Island. On the 12th, the enemy's cover force, which attempted to land in that area, consisted of more than ten cruisers and transport ships. It fought with our mine warfare squadron and sank two enemy cruisers, one of which caught fire. Our side also had one cruiser severely damaged in this battle. This was the night battle of Kolombangara Island on the 12th. On the 14th, the enemy advanced towards Munda from both the north and south sides at the same time. Our troops immediately launched a fierce counterattack. On the morning of the 14th, they defeated the enemy forces that had released smoke screens on the eastern coast of Munda and came to attack. A fierce battle is currently underway. The enemy's counterattack attempt is indeed quite strong. We are prepared to lure the enemy who landed on the eastern side of Munda deep into the area and strike them, in order to crush the enemy's large-scale counterattack attempt and make the battle situation favorable.

<h3 id="e17">Navy Garrison Area Carries Out Second Phase of Disease Prevention Injections <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The city's health authorities are actively carrying out the summer injection campaign. The first phase has been completed, and the second phase of the injection campaign has already begun in the French Concession. The Municipal Council's Health Department is scheduled to continue the campaign from August 1st. The Hongkou Navy Garrison Area has been decided by the district chiefs' meeting to start district injections from the 26th of this month. The methods are exactly the same as in the first phase. The disease prevention certificates from the first phase in April will be invalidated and must be reinjected to maintain public health within the area.</p>
<h3 id="e18">First Day of Air Defense Training Yesterday: Comprehensive Training Today: Residents Should Pay Attention to Signals and Not Cool Off Outdoors: Pedestrians Should Stay Close to Walls or Buildings When Hearing an Alarm <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters stipulated yesterday and today as the dates for civil air defense training, the city's Baojia authorities have been actively preparing various air defense measures. Yesterday (22nd), after issuing a warning alarm at 5:00 AM, the Baojia districts' self-defense corps, fire brigades, lighting brigades, lookout teams, rescue teams, traffic control teams, and others all mobilized and patrolled their respective Baojia districts. Warning ropes were laid along the route, vehicles stopped driving, and two aircraft soared into the sky, simulating enemy aircraft attacks. The sound of anti-aircraft guns rumbled, shaking all of Shanghai, and the performance was quite realistic. It was lifted at 10:30 AM, but the warning alarm was still in effect. The second air raid alarm was issued at 2:00 PM and lifted at 3:15 PM. The third air raid alarm was issued at around 9:00 PM and lifted at around 11:00 PM. At the same time, a blackout was held. Comprehensive training will still be carried out today.</p>
<p>No Loitering Outside to Cool Off</p>
<p>The authorities concerned sincerely hope that the public can pay close attention to various signals. Given that during the summer season, residents generally have the habit of cooling off outside their doors, during the air defense period, residents should go indoors except when walking, and should not loiter on the roads to avoid obstruction. When pedestrians hear an alarm, they should try to get close to the road wall, or use buildings to shield their bodies, and then try to return home as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Air Raid Alarm Iron Gates Closed</p>
<p>Since yesterday, after the air raid alarm was activated, the entire district of Nanshi was under the guidance of the Air Defense Command of the Municipal Police Bureau. All police officers and self-raising corps and Baojia personnel immediately launched air defense preparations. All traffic was cut off, and vehicles and pedestrians were all prohibited. The iron gates at the intersection of the Chinese and French borders were also closed. Only after the alarm was lifted did the self-defense corps hold an emergency meeting. Allied gendarmerie also attended, reviewing the preparedness measures. A blackout was implemented in the evening, and all civilian lights were covered. Police patrols and Baojia patrols were dispatched to patrol the entire district to prevent villains from taking advantage of the opportunity to act. At the same time, the Police Bureau's Inspection Department dispatched inspectors to be on duty at all times to ensure thoroughness.</p>
<p>Self-Defense Corps Members Serve All Night</p>
<p>During this training period, self-defense corps members in each district serve all night, that is, lookout teams, rescue teams, fire brigades, lighting brigades, etc., must also take shifts all night, serving in their respective Baojia offices and rescue stations. Liaison officers are always in contact with their respective police stations.</p>

<p>Following the authorities' efforts to eliminate speculation and hoarding and suppress commodity prices, those who hoard major commodities will be severely punished in accordance with the "Punishment of Hoarding Commodities Statute." An investigation of the inventory in various banks, trading houses, and private warehouses has been completed, and the stored goods have been reviewed to determine whether there is any hoarding for profit, in order to impose penalties. To prevent the use of bank and trading house funds to fuel speculation and hoarding, a thorough investigation of the loan ledgers of various banks and trading houses has been conducted, focusing on loans secured by goods and large overdrafts. Non-members of trade associations who hoard major commodities for profit will be reported and prosecuted, and banks and trading houses that lend to those dealing in these commodities will also be sanctioned according to law. A Shanghai News Agency reporter learned yesterday from the banking and money industry that various banks and trading houses are deeply aware of this and are conducting strict reviews of loan requests from members of various trade associations, refusing loans that are deemed likely to fuel speculation and hoarding. The selection of collateral for loans is limited to items that do not violate current laws and regulations and do not encourage speculation and hoarding. Daily necessities such as grains and cotton yarn are generally no longer accepted as collateral. As for approved loans, they should be limited to borrowers who genuinely need them for their primary business. Factories applying for loans may be assisted as appropriate, depending on their production status. However, overdrafts and credit loans have been particularly tightened, and previous old loans that have expired will not be extended and will generally be recovered.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Reflections on the Recovery of the French Concession <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Qifeng</p>
<p>Minister Xia Qifeng, a member of the Concession Recovery Committee, broadcast his reflections on the recovery of the concession at 9 p.m. yesterday (22nd). The full text of the recording is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots:</p>
<p>Since our country joined the war on January 9th of this year, the friendly nation of Japan, in order to help our country restore its sovereignty, first signed an agreement with our country on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. On March 30th, the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, it returned all Japanese exclusive concessions in China. It also cooperated in mediating with various countries to smoothly recover the Beijing Legation Quarter and the Gulangyu Public Concession. This action by Japan, its vision of grandeur, the integrity of its ideals, the sincerity of its friendship, and the greatness of its courage, not only greatly inspires the Chinese people, who live and die together in the Greater East Asia War, but also inspires and admires the people within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and people around the world who advocate humanity and justice, and regards it as a model. Regarding this point, we can use France's actions as proof.</p>
<p>When France's national affairs were turbulent and the environment was tense, and a myriad of matters were awaiting resolution, it was still able to recognize the situation, overcome difficulties, and voluntarily declare on February 23rd of this year that it would return concessions in China and abolish extraterritorial rights. Subsequently, the governments of both countries consulted on the details of implementation, and on May 18th, they signed an agreement, and on June 5th, they implemented the return of the French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, Anqing East, and Shamian. At that time, I used the radio to report the progress to you. After this, France only had one concession in China, Shanghai, which had not yet been returned. The government and public opinion, up and down, expressed their hope that it would be returned early, along with other concessions. In fact, the authorities of the two countries never slackened in preparing to negotiate on this matter. The Shanghai French Concession in our country has a wider area and a more complex organization. All survey and management and other preparatory procedures require considerable time. In early this month, I met with French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, in Shanghai, along with Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and conducted preliminary consultations on the return of the Shanghai Concession, and formulated principles. On the 12th of this month, all French representatives arrived in Beijing, and the members of the Reception Committee conducted trade-offs and consulted day by day. The opinions of both parties converged, and today the agreement on the details of implementation has been signed, and the date for the return ceremony has been set. After this, all the French concessions in China will be completely returned, and once this ceremony is held, the task of the Reception Committee will be completed.</p>
<p>When this task is about to be completed, I feel that the repeated negotiations have been smooth and satisfactory, thanks to the French government's sincerity towards friendship and its clear judgment of events. At the same time, the French representatives have made beneficial trade-offs with a sincere attitude. We are deeply grateful to them. In addition, our friendly country, Japan, has consistently mediated and generously helped us, and we are sincerely grateful.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the economic hub of our country and a major commercial port in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Its importance is self-evident. For a century, British and American imperialism, based on the Shanghai concessions, infringed on our country's sovereignty and hindered our country's development. Economically, they exploited us, and culturally, they indulged in麻醉. Our people were heartbroken and wanted to take it back for a long time. Because the forces of Britain and the United States were entrenched in it, it was difficult to realize. Fortunately, our friendly country, Japan, launched the Greater East Asia War, fundamentally eliminating the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia, enabling all ethnic groups in East Asia to gain freedom and liberation. Our Supreme Commander Wang Zhaoming complied with public opinion, realized the opportunity, and resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States. Therefore, our country became one of the countries participating in the Greater East Asia War, and our friendly country, Japan, warmly assisted in restoring the integrity of our territory and sovereignty, and removing the amulet of aggression and麻醉. Other friendly countries also闻风而起 and followed suit. Thus, the late Father of the Nation's legacy of abolishing unequal treaties and the enthusiastic expectations of the people of the whole country for many years have all been realized one by one.</p>
<p>When we try to trace the evolution of the above-mentioned facts, we will know that when we are rejoicing and grateful for the return of the integrity of our territory and sovereignty, we must not stop at rejoicing and gratitude. From now on, we should more服齐 the legacy of the Father of the Nation and the major policies and guidelines indicated by the Supreme Leader Wang Zhaoming, support Leader Wang in leading the people of the whole country and the friendly nation of Japan to work together and bravely move forward, so as to express our ambition to participate in the Greater East Asia War, implement the purpose of the Greater East Asia War, and hopefully the great cause of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be completed early, so that China can be restored to its former glory. Finally克遂</p>
<p>The colleagues of the Reception Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the government, are about to complete the handling of this matter, and I am sincerely happy. The labor of writing and speaking is not enough to count. On the day when the agreement is signed, I will report the process and the feelings to the compatriots of the whole country.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Nanjing Road Fang Jiuxia Robbery Case: Remarks by the Police Superintendent; Heartbreaking That Police Officers Killed People; Respect and Condolences Expressed for the Spirit of Sacrifice of the Self-Defense Force <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Police Superintendent Watanabe, the police superintendent of the Public Concession, made the following remarks yesterday regarding the robbery and injury case at Fang Jiuxia Silver Store on Nanjing Road on the 18th of this month:</p>
<p>Punishment According to Law for Murder</p>
<p>"At 0:30 p.m. on July 18th, a shooting murder incident occurred near Fujian Road, within the jurisdiction of the Laozha Police Station. The arrested offender was identified as a Chinese police officer in plainclothes. This fact is extremely regrettable. The authorities have not only immediately dismissed him, but also filed a lawsuit. After further careful investigation, we have some clues. He has been sent to the Special Court today (23rd) for trial on charges of robbery and murder, and will be punished according to Chinese law. It is heartbreaking that there are such illegal offenders among the police officers, resulting in the death of one police officer and two members of the Self-Defense Force. In view of the occurrence of this incident, we are determined to strengthen discipline and live up to the expectations of society.</p>
<p>Promoting the Spirit of Self-Defense and Martyrdom</p>
<p>When the offender was arrested, the bravery of the Indian police officers was undeniable. The head of the Self-Defense Force, Mr. Shen Heqing, and the members of the Self-Defense Force, Mr. Jiang _, stepped forward bravely and fulfilled their mission. Their outstanding sense of responsibility and lofty spirit of sacrifice can be said to be the true essence of China's Baojia Self-Defense. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Baojia Self-Defense Force education, which has been cultivated with the spirit of sharing weal and woe, has blossomed and borne fruit today.</p>
<p>Sincerely Expressing Condolences for Lofty Sacrifices</p>
<p>We sincerely express our condolences for the lofty sacrifices of the martyrs. In the future, we will reward their merits in accordance with the regulations, so as to commemorate their immortality. We hope that the members of the Self-Defense Force will further consolidate unity to ensure public security and achieve the purpose of self-defense, and that is my prayer."</p>
<p>Funeral Arrangements for Martyred Self-Defense Personnel</p>
<p>Regarding the funeral arrangements for the martyred Self-Defense Force members Shen Heqing and Jiang _, the Baojia Association of the Laozha District Police Station has arranged the following yesterday: (1) The funeral procession will depart from the funeral home with the coffin, pass through the designated route, and then return to the funeral home to disperse. (2) The tribute procession: All agencies and organizations in the city will send two representatives to the funeral home to participate in the public memorial service.

<p>Our newspaper's student aid campaign received a letter from China Xingren Enterprise Company yesterday, stating that on the occasion of Chairman Xiao Xiling's 51st birthday last month, friends sent congratulatory gifts. Xiao insisted on refusing them, and donated a portion of the congratulatory money, 5,000 yuan, to our newspaper for student aid. Mr. Shao Jigao of Zhongfu Bank also contributed his opinions in addition to donating 500 yuan, saying that there are still few schools that emphasize practical knowledge. Business students are not proficient in abacus and handwriting is too bad, especially women's schools often lack cooking and embroidery, which is a pity. Mr. Xu Zhongyong also wrote a letter stating that he is more than willing but unable to help students. He was very grateful to Mr. Han Yiqun of Ruixin Cotton Cloth Company for soliciting 2,000 yuan for student aid.</p>
<p>Fan Association Student Aid: Mr. Yan Zhushi has been studying seal script for nearly ten years and has a deep foundation. Recently, in response to our newspaper's student aid campaign, he is willing to work hard, writing fans and four-foot couplets, charging 50 yuan per piece. After deducting 20 yuan for paper and ink expenses (fan and rice paper are not charged separately, and 10 yuan is added for the paper for five-foot couplets), the remaining 30 yuan will be used for the newspaper's student aid. The items should be sent to Yan Zhushi, Window No. 5, 2nd Floor, Shanghai Postal Administration, Sichuan Road Bridge (time: 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.). The couplet styles are displayed at the Shanghai Painting Hall at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Ningbo Road.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Cigarette Distribution to Be Based on New Grades <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association will divide the cigarette shops in the city into four grades: A, B, C, and D, with a distribution ratio of 8:4:2:1. The association, in view of the fact that some tobacco shops with insufficient capital and small scale obtain A and B cards through illegal means, which is unfair if the goods are distributed accordingly, sent personnel to conduct on-site investigations of various tobacco shops to adjust the grades. It is found that there are 6,000 tobacco shops in the city, and the investigation of 2,400 tobacco shops was completed in June.

The distribution of cigarettes from August onwards will be based entirely on the new grades.</p>
<h3 id="e29">New Licenses for Chartered Vehicles to Be Reissued on a Regular Basis; Approved Numbers to Be Burned to Prevent Theft <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Information Office announced that private rickshaw owners who wish to apply for licenses for the second half of this year must send their vehicles to the Vehicle Inspection Office of the Police Department for inspection and have the "approved number" matching the license plate number burned on them. This procedure is the same as the bicycle licensing method to prevent the theft of private rickshaws.</p>
<p>Strictly Observe Vehicle Inspection Dates</p>
<p>Private rickshaws parked overnight in the area south of Suzhou Creek should obtain license application forms from the Vehicle Inspection Office at 557 Gordon Road. Private rickshaws parked overnight in the area north of Suzhou Creek should obtain these application forms from the Vehicle Inspection Office at 612 Fair Road. The dates for obtaining the application forms are set from July 26th to July 31st, from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. each day. All vehicle owners must strictly observe the dates, times, and locations for vehicle inspection specified in the application form in order to reduce inconvenience and delays. Those who fail to send their vehicles for inspection at the specified dates and times will be fined a special registration fee of 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Bring Citizen Certificate for Inspection</p>
<p>In addition, the following important regulations should also be noted: (1) When applying for a license at the Vehicle Inspection Office, applicants should bring their citizen certificates for inspection. If it is a company or factory, the citizen certificate number of the representative should be filled in the application form, and the citizen certificate should be presented for inspection when receiving the license. (2) If the address of the owner of a registered vehicle changes from one administrative region to another, a transfer certificate should be obtained from the issuing agency so as to apply for a new license from the administrative region to which the owner has moved and have a new approved number burned on the vehicle. The same procedure should be followed if a vehicle owner intends to transfer the vehicle to a resident living in another administrative region. If a vehicle owner is unable to personally collect the license from the Vehicle Inspection Office due to special circumstances, a representative may be sent to collect the license on his/her behalf, but the representative should bring the vehicle owner's citizen certificate for inspection.</p>

<p>Recently, wheat from various areas has been arriving in Shanghai one after another. Sino-Japanese flour mills in the city are about to start production. The planned flour production in Central China this year is 10 million bags, and the estimated annual consumption in the Shanghai area is 4 million bags. After being produced by the flour mills in the city, they will be handed over to the Business Statistics Association for supply. The rationing system is unlikely to change.</p>

<h3 id="e34">My Opinion on the Student Aid Campaign <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Haibo</p>
<p>Our newspaper has recently received letters from all walks of life expressing their opinions on student aid, which shows their concern. We are publishing them to show our respect.</p>
<p>The newspaper has been organizing student aid for four sessions to help out-of-school youth obtain opportunities to continue their studies. The past achievements have won the praise of society. This is the beginning of the fifth student aid campaign, and it is expected that this year's harvest will exceed the past. The student aid campaign is a most meaningful work. Every youth hopes to study for a few more years and gain more knowledge in preparation for entering society in the future. However, with the current high cost of living, it is difficult for parents to cope with the daily necessities, let alone spend a considerable amount of tuition fees. It is heartbreaking that the issue of tuition fees limits the youth's pursuit of education. Moreover, there are often many outstanding talents among poor children, and there are many so-called promising talents, but social conditions force the poor to sigh with regret about seeking education. It is even more heartbreaking. Some people say, can't schools universally establish free or reduced-fee places? But one must also think for the schools. Schools are not for-profit organizations. Whether public or private, they all have budgets, and teachers are already very poor. If the majority of students have to be free or reduced-fee, how can the school's funding be injected, and wouldn't the teachers' lives become a problem again? The so-called "saving the frog but starving the snake" is not a win-win solution. Therefore, the advantage of the student aid campaign is that it can not only benefit poor children, saving them from the pain of dropping out of school, but also prevent the schools from being economically affected. It takes care of both sides and is a win-win situation, which is worthy of praise. We have unlimited sympathy and hope that people from all walks of life in the community will unite and actively donate to help them succeed. More student aid means more talent cultivated, which is of great benefit to the country and society.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Thrift in Shanghai! <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Thrift in Shanghai is most urgent because Shanghai is the distribution hub for the entire nation's supplies. If Shanghai can cut back on consumption, then the entire country can save over half of its resources. However, thrift is also most difficult in Shanghai because Shanghai has become accustomed to the bad habits of Europe and America, with their emphasis on extravagance. This has taken deep root. Adding to this the speculators, who have no sense that "money doesn't come easily" and "material resources are scarce," they all adopt the "live for today" approach. They become wealthy overnight and treat money carelessly, like dirt. The extravagant social atmosphere has only become more and more outrageous!</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the practice of the thrift movement must begin with the kind of people mentioned above, because every one of them stands in opposition to thrift. At the very least, we must advise them on one point: even if they cannot achieve our ideal level of consumption thrift, they must still save a portion, even a small portion, of their consumption and use it for acts of generosity and public assistance, or to donate to the poor and needy, or to aid the elderly and weak. This would still be somewhat satisfactory.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Explanation of Qualification Registration Procedures for Wheat Merchants in Various Regions; Unregistered Merchants May Not Participate in Buying and Selling <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The National Trade Control Council, following the Executive Yuan's approved plan for centralized wheat purchasing, is handling the yellow form and buying and selling registration for members of the Chinese Grain Trade Association and the Japanese Flour Milling Trade Association's members. The original intent was to unify the purchasing steps to prevent malpractices. Any wheat merchants who have not participated in qualification registration may not participate in buying and selling. Our reporter has investigated the explanation of the registration procedures for wheat merchants, recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wheat Firms in Centralized Areas: (1) All members of the local Grain Trade Association who engage in the wheat business must obtain certification from the local Grain Trade Association where the firm is located, and then register with the local branch office to obtain a Wheat Firm Registration Certificate for Centralized Areas and receive a Wheat Firm Buying and Selling Report Form for Centralized Areas. They must report the actual buying and selling situation to the branch office every day. (2) Wheat firms in centralized areas may also engage in sales businesses, but they must obtain sales qualification and follow all the procedures stipulated for sales businesses.</p>
<p>Sales Businesses: All members of the Grain Trade Association may become sales businesses, but they must obtain a Sales Business Registration Certificate from the branch office in the area of export. The procedures are as follows: (1) Those who go to other places for purchasing must obtain certification from the association where the firm is located, then register and obtain certification from the association in the purchasing area (export area), and then register and obtain certification from the branch office in the purchasing area. They must obtain a Sales Business Registration Certificate and a Sales Business Buying and Selling Report Form and report the actual buying and selling situation to the local branch office every day. (A sales business must obtain a registration certificate from each branch office in each area where they purchase). (2) Those located in the export area must obtain certification from the local association and register with the local branch office to obtain a Sales Business Wheat Buying and Selling Report Form and report the actual buying and selling situation to the local branch office every day. (3) Sales businesses may also operate as wheat firms in centralized areas, but those who also operate as such must obtain two types of qualification registration certificates. However, the deadline for qualification registration for wheat firms in centralized areas is fixed (July 20), while the deadline for qualification registration for sales businesses is not fixed. (4) Sales businesses must purchase wheat from qualified and registered wheat firms in centralized areas and may not directly purchase from rural areas or unregistered wheat firms.</p>
<p>Commissioned Businesses: (1) All members of the Grain Trade Association designated by flour mills and approved by the committee will be granted a Commissioned Business Certificate. (2) After obtaining the association's Commissioned Business Registration Certificate, if the commissioned business goes to various places to purchase wheat from wheat firms in centralized areas, they should take the above-mentioned registration certificate (or a photograph of the original certificate) to the Grain Trade Association in the purchasing area for certification, and then register with the local branch office to receive a Commissioned Business Wheat Purchase Report Form. They must report the actual purchase situation to the branch office every day. (3) Commissioned businesses may purchase wheat from wheat firms in centralized areas in various regions. Commissioned businesses may purchase wheat from sales businesses. For those transporting wheat into Shanghai, the commissioned business should apply for an entry permit on behalf of the applicant. (5) Commissioned businesses may also operate as sales businesses. Although there are no explicit provisions in the interim plan, wheat purchased by sales businesses can be sold to any commissioned business, while wheat purchased by commissioned businesses must be completely handed over to the commissioned flour mill and may not be resold to others. Therefore, in fact, commissioned businesses may not operate as sales businesses to avoid potential malpractices. (6) Commissioned businesses must purchase wheat from qualified and registered wheat firms in centralized areas or sales businesses and must not purchase from wheat merchants who have not obtained the above-mentioned qualification.</p>

<p>The Cotton Industry Special Committee has recently completed a centralized purchase plan for cotton and is actively purchasing it in various regions. The committee, noting the inconsistent pricing in various regions, which hinders the purchasing work, has carefully calculated the cost of each unit of cotton and set a unified price to ensure smooth purchasing. Furthermore, the cotton collected from various regions is uniformly centralized in public warehouses.</p>

<p>The Materials Investigation Committee, led by Chinese and Japanese investigators, dispatched all investigators last Tuesday to conduct zonal investigations of the materials stored in various warehouses and godowns. The initial work has been completed, and the materials resulting from all investigations have been roughly reviewed. The committee is now scheduled to hold its second committee meeting this afternoon (the 22nd) at 3:00 PM to discuss all important cases related to the investigation of materials. It is reported that after this meeting, the committee will conduct further expanded investigations to completely eliminate the hoarding situation in this city.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Ninety-Five Banks in the City Increase Capital <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance of the National Government previously instructed the Shanghai banking and money industries to increase their capital within a six-month period. The capital of money shops was to be increased to 6 million yuan, with 3 million yuan actually paid up. Ordinary commercial banks with trust departments were to have a minimum capital of 5 million yuan, with 3 million yuan as bank capital and 2 million yuan as trust capital. Therefore, the banking and money industries have been discussing capital increase plans since receiving the order. It is now learned that there are a total of 166 banks of all sizes in the city (including 16 banks currently applying to the Ministry of Finance for registration), with a total capital of 503,512,183 yuan. Among them, 36 banks have capital of 5 million yuan or more, 33 banks have 3 million yuan or more, 37 banks have 1 million yuan or more, 38 banks have 1 million yuan or more, and 22 banks have capital of less than 1 million yuan (all of the above are paid-up capital). Therefore, there are a total of 95 banks in the city that must increase capital within six months.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Trends in Chinese Stocks <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the performance of Chinese stocks continued to decline sharply, as the sentiment after a long rise had already turned weary, and sellers flocked to the market, resulting in a dramatic turnaround, which was expected. Gold prices fell sharply, and buyers were hesitant. It was expected that after a significant drop, those holding stocks mid-way attempted to rally the prices, resulting in some fluctuation, but it was difficult to reverse the downward trend. The cultural industry uniquely stood out, with Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Co. rising to key levels. World Book Co. saw an increase due to high demand and low supply. Among department stores, Wing On Department Store once fell to 500, then rebounded, with Sincere, The Sun, and China Emporium also seeing minor gains. The newly issued shares of The Wing On Department Store rose amid buying pressure. Innerwear and King Lun &amp; Company and Liangfu Shirt &amp; Hosiery also fell initially but rebounded slightly at noon. Wing On Textile fluctuated around the 1,500 level, advancing and then retreating. Smaller stocks like Rong Feng, Sin Fung, and Greater China Weaving all underperformed, while Kuo Hsin Weaving and Hong Sheng Weaving were more stable. Among new pharmaceutical companies, New Asia once approached a key level, then rebounded with Sino-French Pharmacy, while Five Continents remained flat. Banking stocks were slightly weak. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company broke through a key level again. Greater China Match Company was sluggish. Utilities also saw lower prices, with China General Edison Company dropping to a key level, and Chapei Water &amp; Electricity also falling sharply. Industrial stocks saw Chiu An Real Estate retreat to a key level, Greater China Industrial Corporation was slightly weaker, Kuo Hua Investment was stable, and although there were rumors of a capital increase for Union Land Investment, supply exceeded demand. Transactions for Sin Yick within the Customs were quite active. China Water &amp; Electric continued to rise. Tung Yih Trust, Tuck Fung Knitting Factory, Fumin Dairy, Kang Yuan Confectionery, and China Clock Factory remained around the previous day's prices. Financial and food stocks saw no selling pressure. Tatt Yew Stock Farm made its debut, with its price showing a strong edge, about 30% higher than the par value.</p>

<h3 id="e42">The Most Urgent Tasks of the Trade Control Council: Discussing Seven Important Issues <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Although all 22 federations of the Trade Control Council's lower-level organizations have been established, their future still faces many difficulties. To solve these problems, it is hoped that the National Government will strengthen its political power. The most urgent tasks at present are the following:</p>
<p>(1) Price Issues: Regarding price issues, Tang, the director-general of the Trade Control Council, has issued statements explaining that the Trade Control Council and its lower-level organizations, such as the industry federations and trade associations, should bear full responsibility for price control. However, prices are still rising continuously. It is widely rumored that many influential figures in the Trade Control Council's lower-level organizations are involved in speculation and hoarding. Therefore, it is hoped that the Trade Control Council can launch a rigorous campaign to eliminate these illegal elements. The Materials Investigation Committee is currently engaged in a comprehensive investigation. It is also learned that the Shanghai Office of the Materials Control Review Committee is scheduled to be established in mid-August. It is hoped that the Trade Control Council can implement effective price policies as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) Allocation and Procurement Issues: Among the Trade Control Council's lower-level organizations, the most important purchasing work is related to wheat and other grains managed by the Wheat and Flour Special Committee. Its procurement and allocation are relatively smooth compared to other major commodities. General prices have risen two-fold since the establishment of the Trade Control Council, but the price increases related to flour milling have been minimal. This can be considered a preliminary success of the Trade Control Council's work.</p>
<p>(3) Financial Issues: The Trade Control Council has signed a 100 million yuan loan agreement with the Central Reserve Bank for the purchase of wheat. If this is still insufficient, additional loan agreements will be signed. Therefore, the funds for purchasing wheat should not be short.</p>
<p>(4) Materials Investigation Issues: The materials investigation began on the 13th of this month, temporarily limited to cotton yarn and cotton cloth. As a civic autonomous organization, the Trade Control Council naturally does not need to send investigators and investigators. However, the cotton yarn and cotton cloth records from the council's previous investigation have been submitted to the Investigation Committee for reference. Regarding methods of handling materials, the council will provide advice to the relevant authorities whenever necessary and provide maximum cooperation. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e43">Thrift and Increased Production <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Le Xiuliang</p>
<p>The soaring prices are forcing every middle and lower-class citizen to cry out that life is difficult. In this time of war that has spread across the world, the lack of materials and high prices are unavoidable in every country. What lies ahead for us may be even more difficult. To adapt to the environment and to prepare for an even more difficult stage, we should all earnestly practice thrift and at the same time earnestly strive for increased production.</p>
<p>Thrift - although everyone knows about it, it is easy to talk about but difficult to practice. The reason for this is generally due to a lack of self-confidence and a strong sense of vanity. For example, let's talk about clothing. In this society that "only values clothing," one has to be particular in order to maintain appearances. One would rather have bare walls at home but must be well-dressed when going out. As the saying goes: "Silks and satins on the body, no rice for dinner at home." This is a true portrayal of a strong sense of vanity in maintaining appearances. We should point out that this is wrong. We do not deny that there is a phenomenon in this society of only valuing clothing, but we do not need to decorate ourselves by debasing ourselves and selling our belongings in order to avoid the "discrimination and cold treatment" of ordinary people. We should use our true talents to gain the respect of others and do not need to prop up our image with beautiful clothing.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the issue of food! Everyone knows that in this stage where the food problem has become extremely serious, most middle and lower-class families have already cut back as much as possible. However, it is undeniable that the phenomenon of banquets costing thousands of gold, or even ten thousand gold, is still common in brightly lit, music-filled grand hotels and restaurants. "A rich family's banquet is half a year's worth of grain for a poor person," and now it is even more like "a rich person's banquet is ten disaster victims' lives." We hope that wealthy families can consciously practice thrift.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of "travel": we should promote walking, which not only saves transportation costs but can also be considered exercise.</p>
<p>In short, in this difficult era, we should all strive for thrift and not pursue vanity. There is no need to "force oneself to maintain appearances and love face."</p>
<p>However, in addition to passive thrift, we should even more actively strive for "increased production" to balance the supply and demand of materials.</p>
<p>Lack of raw materials and inconvenient transportation are among the factors hindering increased production. However, because the costs of starting a business are so high and it is difficult to maintain, the goods produced are not as easy to earn money from as hoarding raw materials. Who would not be happy to avoid the difficult and choose the easy?</p>
<p>In order to increase production, we hope that the authorities should resolutely crack down on hoarding and protect the development of legitimate industries and businesses, providing as much convenience as possible in various business aspects.</p>
<p>In short, if speculation and hoarding are not cracked down on, legitimate enterprises will have no way to develop, and increasing production will only become words on paper. It is equally wrong and unreasonable to blindly criticize those who run businesses without foresight or to disregard reality and only ask those who run businesses to love themselves.</p>
<p>At this time, promoting thrift in materials and increasing production is an urgent task that cannot be delayed. We hope that insightful people in society will enthusiastically advocate it, lead by example, and earnestly do it so that this movement does not become an empty formality and remain at the level of knowledge and slogans.</p>
<h3 id="e44">A Visit to the Sacred Heart Hospital in Xujiahui (II) <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Lives of Infants</p>
<p>At either end of a grassy area stand two old Western-style buildings. Because they are frequently repaired and painted, one cannot tell that they were built seventy-four years ago. It is said that there were plans to renovate them into new buildings the year before last, and everything was well prepared. Unfortunately, the Pacific War broke out on December 8, and it could not be realized. Now, these old buildings have been divided into bedrooms for the orphaned infants, with seven rooms in the front and back. The children each have their own small copper cribs with mosquito nets made of tulle. The blankets, mats, and quilts are all clean. Some are still sleeping, and some are being fed milk by the Sisters. Almost all of them are plump and lively. Especially the group of three- and four-year-olds, they are all innocent and lovely, each one is fair and beautiful. The reporter could not help but sigh, "Even the children of middle-class families today cannot enjoy such a life?" However, Sister Jin said, "A few months ago, each of them was sallow and emaciated, and their nutrition was really inadequate. The nannies and older girls who cared for them shed tears for these poor children almost every day. Fortunately, the Poor and Sick Relief Association has repeatedly provided subsidies and restored the supply of milk and eggs, so they have become plump, fair, and rosy again, like they are today."</p>
<p>When the orphaned infants reach the age of four or five, they receive kindergarten education. According to a set schedule, they have talks, games, meals, and rest. The children have various toys such as small cars, bicycles, rocking horses, and slides. Because the children are isolated from the outside world as soon as they enter the orphanage, various charts and models are prepared so that they can gain new knowledge about ships, trains, cars, airplanes, and so on. In addition to two congees and one rice meal each day, there is also a snack once a day. After lunch, they must take a nap, and after waking up, they go to the garden for a walk. The daily life of the children is supervised by the nuns, nannies, and older orphans, completely in accordance with hygiene and education principles, which is more affectionate and reasonable than the way mothers and older siblings treat their children and younger siblings. There is absolutely no knowledge of gambling, drinking, or bad language. In the peaceful environment and reasonable upbringing, they can all preserve their good innate nature. For older female orphans from outside, they are adopted separately. They (currently about 50 people) have three large bedrooms and a dining room, separated from the female orphans who have been in the orphanage since childhood. Male orphans are sent to the Tushanwan Orphanage after the age of five. Therefore, the life of the orphaned infants in the Sacred Heart Hospital is completely pure, innocent, and reasonable.</p>
<p>The integration of work and learning, life is education, the orphans in the Sacred Heart Hospital have been practicing it for a long time. The education here can be divided into two departments: first, general education. After completing kindergarten education at the age of six or seven, the general female orphans are taught public education, from primary school to senior primary school. In addition to subjects such as language, literature, history, geography, arithmetic, and calligraphy, they are also taught various household chores, such as making beds, cleaning bedrooms, sweeping classrooms and work areas, setting the table and washing dishes, and washing and cooking in the kitchen, as well as planting and watering in the garden. They are taught and practice at any time, and the older ones take care of the younger ones, helping them with work and learning, which is similar to the so-called "little teacher system." At the same time, according to the orphaned girls' natural abilities, they are assigned to learn various crafts such as embroidery, lace, sewing, and weaving in order to prepare them for supporting themselves in society after leaving the orphanage, so that they do not become parasites of society.</p>
<p>Second, for disabled female orphans, these most unfortunate of the unfortunate, appropriate education is also provided separately. Particularly noteworthy is the seriousness of deaf-mute education. They are first taught to pronounce sounds with French letters, assisted by gestures, and then gradually taught to recognize words, read, and write. After three or four years, they can talk to others, with clear pronunciation that is easy for listeners to understand. After five or six years, they can be compared to those who are not mute. There are currently eighteen mute individuals, divided into classes. Each teacher teaches a maximum of only four people, which is already extremely difficult. The reporter visited during the summer vacation, but the deaf students were still in class. A nanny was teaching each of them individually, using both her mouth and hands. A seven- or eight-year-old deaf girl wrote on the blackboard, "Welcome distinguished guests to visit, we are all orphans without parents." They were also able to answer the reporter's questions, and the teacher's diligence and patience were even more moving. In almost every workshop in the orphanage, there are deaf-mute girls, and their achievements are worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Those orphaned girls with particularly superior talents and aspirations can go on to higher education. There are currently about thirty orphaned girls studying at Xujiahui Attached Primary School, one is studying in middle school, and a group is taking advantage of the summer vacation to hire female teachers to tutor them in English and other subjects in order to obtain better grades after entering middle school in the fall. The nuns' emphasis on and love for the orphaned girls' future is truly like that of their own daughters.</p>
<p>Workshops and Daycare Centers</p>
<p>In order to teach the orphaned girls the skills to maintain their lives, and for the orphaned girls who have married to come to the orphanage to work when they need to make a living, the Sacred Heart Hospital Nursery has opened several workshops in the orphanage, including an embroidery workshop, a lace workshop, a sewing workshop, a wool workshop, a laundry, and a repair room. To meet the practical needs of the female workers, a small-scale daycare center has been opened. There are currently 33 outside female workers and 10 orphaned girls in the embroidery workshop, embroidering various flowers, birds, animals, landscapes, portraits, and other items of various sizes, most of which are pre-ordered by people from all walks of life. The reporter saw that among the embroidered gift scrolls that had already been embroidered, there was one with colorful landscapes and figures embroidered within the three characters of a person's name, which was very exquisite. Most of the embroidered products can be compared to Xiang embroidery seen in Changsha and Xiangtan, and are by no means as crude as the products sold on the market. There are currently 17 outside female workers and 3 orphaned girls in the lace workshop, making bed sheets, pillowcases, wool blankets, napkins, tea towels, handkerchiefs, women's and children's clothing, etc. Anyone who has praised the Shantou lace craftsmanship will be amazed at how delicate and exquisite the handiwork of the orphaned girls and deaf-mute girls is. There are 28 outside female workers and 2 orphaned girls in the sewing workshop. There are many new-style sewing machines, all working busily, mostly for orders from all sides. The scope of the laundry is also not small, divided into washing, starching, and ironing departments, with water troughs and electric ironing equipment, which are extremely complete. In addition, there are also wool workshops, repair departments, etc., which meet the current needs of society and specialize in repairing clothes, socks, woolen knitwear, etc. There are knitting machines and hosiery machines. There are currently 13 outside female workers and 10 orphaned girls in the wool workshop, and 45 outside female workers and 4 orphans in the laundry and repair workshops. Older orphaned girls are already teaching the younger girls how to work, and their skills are so pure that they can match the skills of factory technicians.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Appeal for Deaf-Mute Refugee Children <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Deaf-mute children are born with disabilities, and now they have suffered disasters and hardships, with their families broken and their homes destroyed. Alone and destitute, they wander the streets, suffering unspeakable hardships. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Section and charitable organizations have discussed with the Fu Dumb School, a disability education institution in this port, to receive and educate these helpless children. More than a dozen children have been admitted so far, and they are all working hard in their studies. However, since the war, the Fu Dumb School's financial resources have been cut off, and it is difficult to maintain. This semester's shortage of more than 20,000 yuan cannot be made up, and it is feared that it will be suspended. Therefore, we appeal to warm-hearted people in society to help these poor, helpless deaf-mutes. Donations should be sent to this newspaper for collection, or to 33 Huangjiasha Garden Road, Shanghai Fu Dumb School. An official receipt will be issued and presented respectfully. All matters of the school are open, and you are welcome to visit and give guidance at any time.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Poor Children's Crafts Institute moved to the West District Fire Brigade on Zhonghua Road in the South City, and later because the number of children was too large and not enough to accommodate, a second institute was added. The chairman of the board, Yuan Ludeng, and the president, Chen Fukang, respectfully invited people from all walks of life to visit the institute the other day.</p>
