<p>社評</p>
<h3>移交英美敵產以後</h3>
<p>十月二十五日，日本駐北京大使館鹽澤公使，赴華北政務委員會遞交移交第二種敵產之文件，將包括第二種關係大部份之英美敵產三十九件，正式移交中國方面管理，自二十五日起，日軍不再施行管理之權。</p>
<p>同月二十八日，日大使館谷大使通知外交部褚部長，爲第三次華中華北地區之英美敵產八十七件，移交中國，定十月三十一日辨理正式移交手績。</p>
<p>按前於五月一日，日本駐北京日大使館會移交第一種敵產六百四十六件。又於本年二月八日移交華中華北各地敵產一千零三件，六月移交漢口，廣州，厦門各地敵產四五九件。</p>
<p>我們綜觀歴次移交敵產管理，充分證明盟邦日本，對於調整中日國交之根本精神，始終一是，尊重中國領土主權之完整，貫澈實踐，直至此次簽訂中日同盟條約，愈益具體表明其熊度與誠意，尤貴乎說到做到的實踐精神。這是應該使我們澈底認識的有一個方面。</p>
<p>不過，我們認爲尚有從速實施的一點，就是中國人民所私有的財產，過去認爲有敵性而由日軍管理的，現在雖巳有理由或事實可以證明並非敵性，但仍無發還表示，也許因爲中國人民私有財產的數量瑣屑，尚未爲日當局所注意，而未作交還計議，可是，大處的調整，固然爲人民所注視，對於邦交改善的影響，效力固大；而、小處的調整，也很足以使一部分人的觀感頓變，心悅誠服，這於民間情感的改善影　，效力並不爲小，况且，事實上按中國社會內容，凡是中國人民私產有被視爲敵性可能者，則其所有人，至少爲社會上有地位者，對於社會上自有其影響老百姓觀感的作用，或是財產所有人，業已認識中日關係的新轉捩，而開始爲兩國邦交努力，是則尤共不能視爲尚存敵性。在此中日同盟條約甫經頒布，正待兩國人士，尤其民間感情充分密切，進而澈底認識同盟精義，相亙申釋，共同瞭解之際，更應重視民間觀感的培育發揚。而交還民間私有財產解除敵產處分一點，實不失爲目前應當注意實踐之一端。</p>
<p>况且，在理義上以言，敵人英美的產業，旣承移交中國管理，那末，中國民間私產，巳無敵性因素者，似乎尤應交還。因此，我們認爲無論從任何方面以言，當此中日關係又進入新階段之際，對於已無敵性的中國人民私產，即應從速予以更新審查，實施交還，深信盟邦當局必能考慮及此，不久之將來，見諸實施。</p>
<p>我們本於知無不言，言無不盡之然忱，感於近頃盟邦日本交還英美敵產賢明之舉，益受中日同盟條約之新生感觸，率直陳詞，亟盼有關當局迅加考慮，及早實施，中國民間對日情感，因此而益見親密，定可預卜！</p>

<p>同時吾人須知訂中日滿三岡之堅盟，乃為牢乎不動之中核體，其後隨世界情勢之演進，益促進巾日兩國關係之飛躍進展，大東亞戰爭勃發後，國民政府對美英宣戰，因而巾國對於建設大東亞之責任，亦更加重大，我國立即履行基本條約，交還租界，協助收回公共租界，公使館區域，以及撤廢治外法權等着着實現對華新政策，國民政府亦適應我國之政策，竭力實行改善國內態勢，且已收獲顯著成果，今兩國為順應此新情勢，將基本條約加以根本改訂，此次乃締結此同盟條約新同盟條約之內容，為　互相尊重自主獨立，　為建設基於道義之大東亞，及確保安定，而互相協力，　實行互惠之經濟提携，　戰爭狀態終了略，將旣成事項加以調整，並撤兵等，此可謂為建設大東亞復興亞洲之大憲章</p>
<p>中日合作共保東亞</p>
<p>中國國父孫中山先生曾倡大亞洲主義，主張亞洲為亞洲人之亞洲，彼會謂中國必須完成自主獨立之國家，同時希望日本進而放棄所謂不平等條約，使中日永恒合作，共保東亞，此種言辭極為熱烈懇切，但渝方至猶勾結英美，使東亞淪為奴隸境地，現在所謂不平等條約，在巾日兩國間，已不存在，國民政府與日本共同守衛東亞為重建東亞而共同奮鬥，孫先生於地下當亦感慨無量矣。現吾人一面遂行規模龐大而且英烈之戰爭，同時進行大束亞之建設，此實為根據偉大之理想，但亦決非輕而易舉之事態。但吾人本必勝之信念，堅持到底，以爭取最後之勝利，使大束亞完全脫離英美之極桔，以確保東亞之和平，進而建設根據道義之新世界，此即吾人正在努力之事項。</p>
<h3>我國承認　印臨時政府　褚外長昨電鮑斯申明</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社電　印度臨時政府已正式宣告成立，今後大東亞又增一有力之友邦，協助完遂大東亞戰爭，深信必能達成任務，國府禇外交部長特電江特拉鮑斯主席，代表國府申明承認臨時政府幷達慶賀之忱，原電如下：印度臨時政府江特拉鮑斯主席閣下，頃奉來電，欣知閣下共建東亞，負起偉大使命，領導印度民衆，爭取獨立自由，樹立臨時政府，決心參戰，印度民族之夙願始克早日完遂，本國政府特電申明，承認賣臨時政府，並達慶賀之忱，中華民國國民政府一外交部部長褚民誼。</p>
<p>褚外部長發表談話</p>
<p>南京一日中央社褚外交部長一日為印度樹立臨時政府發表談話如下：上月二十一日印度臨時政府正式成立，推戴江特拉鮑斯為主席，同時表明印度國民討伐英美之決心，此舉在印度獨立運動史上，有其劃時代之意義，且為東亞建設過程中之光輝成果。</p>
<p>印度受英國帝國主義者之壓迫榨取，遂致數百年前富貴繁榮之樂園，一變而為貧困肌餓之　境，印度民衆，以不堪英國之壓迫，迭起反英獨立運動，最爲深入全印民問，但反英獨立運動均遭英國歷制，甘地且被英人橫加壓迫拘禁，至此英帝國主義者侵略弱小民族之猙獰面目，暴露無遺。自印度受英國侵略之後，其疆土途成為英國向亞洲各地肆行侵略之根據地，我亞洲不少民族及國家，遂與印度同受英國之桎桔，而英帝國主義者，又以與美國有（血濃水）之關係，兩者狼狽為奸，對我亞洲施其戕賊，由此可知在何東亞人，必須認淸英美為其共同之敵人。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭之旨趣，在於擊減英美，解放並建設東亞，自戰爭勃發獲，經盟邦將士之英勇善戰，迭有赫赫戰果，奠定勝利基礎，但印度境內迄今仍有英美侵略勢力盤據其問，肆行榨取屢迫，是故大柬亞戰爭進行，至於今日，解放印度，仍為必然之步驟，盟邦東條首相曾有援助印度獨立之表示。現在印度臨時政府業已誕生，且決定側重戰鬥組織，實現其進軍新方針之壯志</p>
<p>大東亞全域，現已充滿欣欣向榮之氣運，我國承盟邦日本熱誠援助，交還租界，撤廢治外法權，已實現獨立自主之積年宿願。緬甸與菲律賓，亦已在盟邦日本援助之下，完成光榮之獨立。茲者印度亦已開始步上獨立之途，從此東亞十備民族，將一致團結，向完遂大東亞戰爭完成大東亞建設之途邁進，此我人所以於逖聽印度臨時政府成立之餘，衷心心慶祝，有不能自己者。</p>

<h3>中日同盟與實現國父遺志　陳立法院長廣播辭</h3>
<p>中日的同盟條約，已於十月三十日妥訂了，自此次同盟條約簽訂之後，已往的中日基本關係條約，連同共一切　屬文書，是一併失效了，就是這在四十多年以前的辛丑條約也廢止了。關於同盟絛約簽訂的意義，汪主席業於十月三十日訂定之後，向全國同胞鳴示，各位也已經很明白而了解了，要而會之，自後中華民國三十二年十月三十日起，中　民國已完全獨立·自由·平等「更沒有不平等條約的存在了」。</p>
<p>消滅痕跡兩種機運</p>
<p>此次中日同盟條約的成立，完全某於東方道義的精神，基於日木自動的友誼和好意，這是我們應該致無限的敬意和謝意的。可憶本人在二十九年國民政府還都後、五月問奉命至日本否禮，會在興亞團體聯合會及言論界聯合招待會上說過：「戰爭決非起於一日，而和平也非　成於一時，我這希望兩國有　之士，以後還要共同不斷的努力。」對於東方的道德請神，我也曾　過了「我的意見，以爲這次中日調整關係？不過是結東事變，與開始和平的第一個階段，東方道德與西洋正同，就是「莫逆於心，相　於無言」，一　到條件，覺得沒有意思了。因此我希望在事變結束一之後，日本能夠不斷的自動的修正已定的關係，而中國也不斷的自動的增好末來的關係，這才是眞正和平」。革於我的理想是怎樣呢？當時我說：「我還拘有一個理想，以爲中日兩國將來有兩種機運，可以消滅爾我的痕跡，共一是東亞有一天危局的來臨。中日兩國，共同站在一條生死棧。其二是和平之後，我們計劃出一個東亞國際的機橋，防衛以東亞爲中心，經濟也以東亞爲中心，按　國家問防　綫之長短，人口之多寡，以分配防衛之責任，按着國家間生存之播要，發展的程序，以確定工商業和資源的發展，這樣各保固有的主權，共抇安定的責任，忘記了這次事變的痕跡，並且放棄不必要的條件，那時中國眞眞永久和平了」。</p>
<p>自動修正巳定關係</p>
<p>本人遺番語，剛剛說在和平開始之時，似乎希望太奢，但是據我的觀察，以爲不是如此，中日不會有眞正的永久和平。同時我深　日本朝野，具有深識遠見的人士很多。必一不以爲我遺番表示，是一種奢望，更不以我這番表示，是一種高調，我自還都以來，無論如何艱難，如何困苦，始終自　中日爾國必會有共鳴，而中日爾國的民族，具有數千年道義的根性，必會有一日為東亞解放，而同生共死。我同時更有一個？念，以爲中國一面希望日本修正已定的關係，尤須在我首先增好末來的關係。因此自從大東亞戰爭開始以後，中國即決心參加，因為大束亞戰爭是解除自己和解徐東亞各民族的戰爭，依着國父遺囑「戰合世界上以平等等我之民族共同奮鬥」，我們應該不計利　，不計成收，來參加這次歷史上光榮的戰鬥。而目自與日本和平之後，我們已絕抱定決意，不以中日和平爲滿足，而以分擔東亞安定爲己任，我們應該某於沘義，基於友誼，與日本駢　作戰，來完成這次歷史上光榮的任務。</p>
<p>日本在參戰之始，即　會撤消治外法權，交回租界。以後又不止實打交回日本管轄的租界，並目啓我們交涉返還別國的租界，和公共租界·這次日本不但和我們簽訂同盟條約，取消了基本條約，並且更進而廢止辛丑條約，日本已是不斷的自觔的條正已定的關係，而且不斷的自動的增好未來的關係了。</p>
<p>團結一致爭取自由</p>
<p>爭取自由國父造囑諄諄昭示我們　除不平等條約，現在我們可以告慰於國父，可以告慰於我們的祖先，可以告慰於全國國民，然而</p>
<p>第一件大事是國父的大亞洲主義要　須完成，國父告訴我們要喚起災衆，及聯合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奮鬥，因此我們須要和日本協力，致力於完成火東亞戰爭，不僅要扶動已獨立的非律資，緬甸，更要扶助未會獨立的印度三萬五千萬的民衆。我們國民仍須不要忘記我們歷來所受的苦痛，須不要忘記國父遺囑。緬甸以前所身受的痛苦，印度今日所受的病苦，就是我們以前所受的痛苦，渝方的民眾和軍士們萬不要聽信英美帝國主義的　言，緬甸和印度的自由，東亞民族應當國於一致來爭取自己的會由，反抗帝國主義的侵略，以完成大東亞解於的神聖任務。</p>
<p>加緊努力繼續奮鬥</p>
<p>繼續奮鬥第二件大事是國父的三民主義必須實行。國父在遺囑中指示我們要做的，我們祗是做到廢除不平等條約，其餘建國方略·建函大綱·民主義·我們都末曾實行·我們要知道，國父致方於國民草命四卞年，其目的在求中國之自由平等，中國如何才能眞眞自由平等，非實看三民主義不爲功，現在災族主義，才發展半途，民權主義，方在萌芽，至於民生主義，還末　手。凡一個國家不能獨立者，天不能獨立，中國產　尚末發逵，物力是薄弱的，教育尚未普及，人力還是米充的，以言自立，爲時尚　，假使我們妄自較大，以為不平等條約廢除，甲國已經眞正自由平等，那就非愚即託。</p>
<p>全國的同胞們，今後我們仍應十二分努力的，我們盼望全國人民起來，促渝方的　　，實現全面和平，一致加入這個大東亞解放的鬥爭，我們盼望全國人民起來扶助各亞洲民族，如今日中國之自由獨立，更盼望全國人民起來，繼往開來，實行三民主義，復興中華，保衛東亞。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>亞細亞憲章之譽</h3>
<p>最近日衆院　員中　　次於該棉預算總會質詢政府：以爲當茲，英美巳被逐出大東亞之今日，爲基於八　一宇精神，使南方各民族各得其所經見，應以　取消人種差別，　民族平時　讓，　實行某於　惠主義的經濟提　，　發展並滯過文化，　解放資源，及　共　防偉大東亞六條爲原則，以確保大東亞之自給勞態·外相重光葵否覆以爲大東亞之建股，乃以各民族之自動協力爲某礎，故須以互讓精神爲舉討，中島氏所提六條原期，不僅　用於大東亞，抑且應義　於全世界；正義的大道係無界困的，係包括全人類的，大東亞願與任何愛好和平者合作。</p>
<p>上述一間符，日本報人譽之為亞細亞憲章的實佈，並認其意義爲又犬大超過大四洋寒章。可是，大西洋憲章早已爲其起草人英美當局所一再撕被，所以負有亞細亞憲章之春的一切施政方針，益覺難能可貴了。</p>
<p>目前世界戰局勝負的決定，與其說擊於前統的軍事設敗，莫如說擊於後方的經濟安定與否，尤繫於國內外人心的向背如何，道就是所謂「思想戰」「思想戰」的勝利者，非敵底實行王道主義者莫屬，而其失　者，必爲處處不能股期道色彩者，因為言王道者重在利人？故人人「心悅而誠服」，曹　道者重在利己，故人人　覺「敢怒而不敢言」。</p>
<p>王道精神均的具體義現，還是在於地方民生之安定，　句話說，就是人民的能夠安居樂業，所以從事思想戰者不要忘記經濟環，也就是民生安定戰，也就是爭　民衆戰。</p>

<h3>日本增強　生產力量</h3>
<p>企業系列的整備</p>
<p>航空工業的與造過程，係以飛機製造廠為頂點，其下更有許多協力工塲，承包工塲，所以飛機製造廠的規模和能力必須和其協力工塲等的規模能力保持均衡。目前的狀况，各飛機製造廠雖有相當部份須向廠外定造，但因協力工塲等並未能夠完全適應其需要，以教缺少把握，結集對其川流作業難免發生不測的障碍。</p>
<p>在這意下，將若干協力工塲，承包工塲專屬於某飛機製造廠，並使之專門化（成為專製某種零件的工塲），誠為確保大量生產的一個　提　件·最近當局擬實行整帕第二種工業部門，其用意實在於此。在整頓時、對於德國航空工業界　採用的連織制度（事業俗同體）以及過去內閣會議決定的關於飛機用工作機械的企業　團　，應視之為一個雛型，加以考究，為使各飛機製造廠分別成立完全的作業過程綫，改組與航空工業有關的各種產業之生產勢態，實行工塲壓的計畫配置，　屬必要。由於聲音以飛機製造廠爲項點的生產勢態、勞務、原料等各生產要素之合理分配及互相通融力有可能。如是，生產力之完全化為戰力方始有</p>
<p>生產性的向上</p>
<p>和上述企業系列的數備並行，由保持一生產單位內的設備之均衡。以及改良生產過程與勞務管理，以期生產性的回上，　是很重要的事。在重點匹業方面。和織維　業等比較，其生產營的向上以及經營的合　化，素有不很重視的傾向。然而今日的決戰生產既要求將現有生產力完全擊成戰鬥力，則對於此點作劉期的改良、實有必要。</p>
<p>作業專門化，規格統一化，以及生　分野之間定，機械實動率之提高等等急待　決的問題，現正堆積如山。這些問應如能一一解決，那末，以現有的設備和勞力、實行二借三倍的增加生產是很有可能的。</p>
<p>作業過程應設可能加以細分、務他工作簡易化，如此，機械設備方面也可和此相應　按照作業過科的順序　將單能機械作有組織的分配，這樣一來，工員的作業分野便趨於專門化，　成員工的時期即可縮短，而生產速度亦可因而急速增大。至於此種措置所需要的大　機械設備，則由這次飛機用工作機械緊急增胖辦法的施行，當不致有短少不數之慮。</p>
<p>又，日本機械工業的機械系列配置，夙以旋盤為多，其次則為「弗拉易斯盤」，這種工作機械很浪費材料，所以從節省材料傅見地，須積極活用成型　造和銷造等。</p>
<p>統一飛機種類</p>
<p>為使航空工業充分發揮現有生產力計，促進技術的分開和交換，由此將全體製造廠的能率提高到和水準最高的製造廠一樣。實為。上的捷徑　在德國　其情形便是如此。　是屬於一個連環內的工塲。均在同一的條件下從事生　　所　技術是絕對分開的　美國　然他們現已設立航空工業代表會議，十分之九的飛機公司已經加入該會，以期彼此交換技術，這點殊原借鏡。</p>
<p>又　關於飛機尙有一個問題，就是飛機種類的統一和定貨的統制　因為無論　戰鬥機或轟炸機　海軍和陸軍雙方由於作戰目的不同，各需類型相異的飛機、如欲加以統一　的確是一個很難的問題。不過，正如陸軍航空本部生產課布袋少佐最近在某報庫談會席上所說，「生產一種型式的飛機時，如有一〇〇　的生產能力，則在製造兩種飛機時，便减為八〇　，生產三種時，便連五五　也不到了。」為了發揮生慶效力，機種的統一遂成一個縣案。關於這一點，美國會勇敢實行整理機種，原則上每一製造廠僅限於生產一種飛機。因此收得大量生產的效果，對於這個問題。零件的標準化及互換性，發動機型式的統一等等，都是　須解決的。</p>
<p>其次，定貨制度的刷新也是民間的宿望　因為現在的定貨方法是仰別的，因而缺乏有機性的述絡，致令協力工塲　承包工塲的合理動員　生種種缺　，所以與確立航空工業的生產勞態同時，並期望　海軍密切連絡以調整定貨制。</p>
<p>採用日夜工作制</p>
<p>為充分活用現有生　力以完遂一無須添　設備的增產」計，以飛機為中心的軍需工應否採用日夜工作制，頗有考究的　値　關於這問願，在七月第四次中央協力會國席上，後藤直太氏（三菱重工業）等曾熱心提倡，關係　局亦完全　肯，即在科學技術審議會的一確立飛機生產技術方式具體方策」中，也稱一為糾正各生產要素的畸形現狀，以最小的設備完成最大的生產衆計，應强化廿四小時工作制的實施」，主張先行之於金囑加工機械方面，次及工作機械製造廠，然後全面實施畫夜開工制</p>
<p>關於實施書仪關工制、勞務、原料、動力等必須貫撤趨重點的分配又，勢工住宅，便利工員進　工作的運　力等等，雖是次要間　，也須一一解決。至於原料，為圖貫徹其有效的　用，以及由書　開工而提高能　，也須　合固定的新　設計畫之速度，視現實的必要如何，將添坩新設備用的建，資材作為運轉資材</p>
<p>至於勞務，隨各航空關係產業的新增設及畫　工作的實施、所需數量自必龐大，實為意中事。而周書勞務洪需的現狀，如何加以充實，是需要相當苦心的·</p>
<p>關於確保勞工的數量，可根據勞務調整令，限　男子就職，指定禁止的企業種類和職業種類（例如書記之類得業務及其他　易業務等），以期利用因整頓企業而轉業或離載的勞工，而且機械工業是最適合婦女工　的部門，所以不仿利用女子挺身隊等，　　女積極參加。</p>
<p>此外，由於大量雇用無經騐的勞工，勢必引起如何維持工人案質的問題。關於這自問題，可由工作簡易化及配置單純工　機械加以解決。（吉：　自同盟世界消失廿四卷第四十號</p>

<p>日前國民論壇所登載之「關於煤球統制問題」一文、作者之意果在求本市煤球供應之暢通，以解決民生之痛苦，但其所提議之方案細視之，無非人煤球廠商請命當局准其增高價格，但對此點鄙人站在市民之立塲而言，以為有鄭重考慮之必要。按此次煤球之所以不能供應市　之需要，據一般之傳說：煤球廠商欲求增高價格，而為當局所否決。於是敵方即藉口修　機件或原料缺乏　用减少產景作對付手段。但常局所持反對理由亦以事　為根據，因製造煤球之主要原料如白煤屑，烘爐用煤及電力等自去年春日至今從未增價，且如煤屑及電力等反較前减價，但煤球之零售價格倒已由二十五元一擔漲至三十二元五角、故對於增加利潤一點似若無再求之理。且此文作者所列之煤球製造成本分析表，亦有斟酌之處，蓋我人研究一物之成本除觀察其原料個別價格外，對製品所含原料之成分亦得加以注意，因為製品成分變動，對於成本方面有極密切之關係，况製造煤球時煤屑與黃泥間之用量伸縮性甚大，且兩者間成本　差照殊。近日市上所能　得之煤球，其品啟與昔日所購之煤球相較已不啻天壤之別，其所以如此者明　人當能知共究竟　故此文中所謂廠方之利潤僅為一四，六九元是否為一確定之數字亦成問題，而什者堅　此　本分析表作為廠方加價之辯護似有不妥也。</p>
<p>目下上　市政當局對於牛奶公司監督甚嚴，其出品均有一固定之標準，如牛奶中奶油成分　有若千，此種措施之目的固在求市民之康健。但煤球亦爲市民日常重要用品，其品質高下對布民影響雖不若牛奶之爲甚，但以經濟節約及道德立場而論亦有　係，故鄙意以為廠方里堅欲增價，其先決條件，當求其出品能適合規定之標準，而當局除　煤球廠商嚴格執行現價外，對煤球廠製造煤球之成分亦須加以監督，如有發現廠方以劣質煤球應市　當加以成罰，不然所謂限價及限制利潤之用意，皆為徒有也。</p>
<h3>論小學師資待遇</h3>
<p>— 楊錦兆</p>
<p>國民敎育是立國之本。世界各國，皆所重視，國民教育的師資，大都由國家於立專校訓練，其在敎師本身，　視為一種終身的職業。敎師既萬國家訓練。於是在生活上，職位上，均予以秤種保障，使之安心服務，　養朱來的國家主人翁。誰都明白，民族生命的延續，由于教育的傳授；經騐不斷的改造，民族才能生存，才能進步，才能發揚光大。數個月前，看”政府有物資俸給制度的計劃，深為欣幸，但迄今未見實行；在物資沒有充分配給之前，對於師的復過　還有討論的價値。</p>
<p>務遇的標準－我從在小學敎師待遇說起一篇拙文裏，曾經提起過…－依據上海的生活狀况，每人最少生活　用為五百元，小學敎師處遇，應至少一千元。　有人說：這樣獅子大開口，未免希望過者。但我的意見是：薪水是正常的收入，用於正當的用途。小學敎師以敎學為天責，除兒童外不問外事，薪水是他們唯一的生命錢。薪水與現狀相差過眞時，只有一走了事。凡是小學敎師，都贊成陳市長提倡的『廉潔政治，』局時是實行者。我們希訊薪水與現狀符合，妄取一文者，處以極刑。</p>
<p>小學的類別組組枝大葉分起來，小學有私立和市立小學兩種。普通私立小學敎師，待遇在五除元以上。此次市敎育會以按月補助金五十萬元，補助私校中小學教師。據云全市私立小學事八百餘　至登記截止，聲設補助得　僅三百餘校。可見私校敎帥生括的威脅，遠沒有市校的嚴重，嗷嗷待哺。現市校除一，八兩區外，小部分已劃歸區立，佈存七十二校。最低敎員待遇，每月僅二百二十元，與應付個人的實際現狀生活，相差一倍以上，敎育界這成這種不幸現象，種因十複雜的社會環境，魯退先生說：「路是人們走出來的！「我們必需打破目前僵局！</p>
<p>開源的計訓大家小能否認，陳市長和林敎局長，是賢朗的領導者，他們為了小學敎師的薪津，曾費了不少的心鐵。最主要的一點，恐怕增加　担干人民身上，大不忍心。然而，我相僧，只要是洧良心而注視中國前途的人，沒有會反對的。筵　捐是補助敎育經費的稅　，不知道對於增加教帥待過，夠了沒有？每一個墩育工作者，急欲明悉。不夠，公共車輛的乘坐，價可加微行路捐。上海巾「打」的間，至為繁複，若每張票增加數角，即可緊沙　堪，做一些爲民族將來作打算的事業。好在取直於民，用之於民，耀利義務，恰巧相符。况且各國也不乏先例呢！</p>

        <h1>1943.11.02</h1>
<h3>After the Transfer of British and American Enemy Property</h3>
<p>On October 25th, Japanese Minister to Beijing, Mr. Shiozawa, visited the North China Political Affairs Commission to deliver documents for the transfer of the second category of enemy property. Thirty-nine items of British and American enemy property, comprising the majority of the second category, were officially transferred to Chinese management. From the 25th onwards, the Japanese military would no longer exercise management rights.</p>
<p>On October 28th of the same month, Japanese Ambassador Tani notified Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that eighty-seven items of British and American enemy property in the Central and North China regions, the third batch, would be transferred to China, with formal transfer procedures scheduled for October 31st.</p>
<p>Previously, on May 1st, the Japanese Embassy in Beijing transferred six hundred and forty-six items of the first category of enemy property. Furthermore, on February 8th of this year, one thousand and three items of enemy property in various parts of Central and North China were transferred, and in June, four hundred and fifty-nine items of enemy property in Hankou, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other locations were transferred.</p>
<p>Looking back at the previous transfers of enemy property management, we can fully demonstrate that our allied nation, Japan, has consistently adhered to the fundamental spirit of adjusting Sino-Japanese national relations, respecting the completeness of China's territorial sovereignty, and implementing this principle thoroughly. Up to the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty this time, they have even more concretely expressed their attitude and sincerity, and it is especially commendable that they put their words into action. This is one aspect that we should thoroughly recognize.</p>
<p>However, we believe there is one more point that should be implemented promptly, which is the privately owned property of the Chinese people. In the past, property considered to have enemy connections was managed by the Japanese military. Although there may now be reasons or facts to prove that it does not have enemy connections, there has been no indication of its return. Perhaps this is because the quantity of Chinese people's private property is trivial and has not yet caught the attention of the Japanese authorities, and no return plan has been considered. However, large-scale adjustments are certainly noticed by the people, and their impact on improving national relations is significant; on the other hand, small-scale adjustments can also significantly change the perception of a segment of the population, winning their heartfelt conviction. The effect of this on improving popular sentiment is not insignificant. Moreover, in fact, based on the nature of Chinese society, whenever the private property of Chinese people is likely to be regarded as having enemy connections, the owners are at least individuals with status in society, and they naturally have an impact on the perception of ordinary people. Or, the property owners have already recognized the new turning point in Sino-Japanese relations and have begun to work hard for the national relations between the two countries, and therefore, it is all the more impossible to regard them as still possessing enemy connections. At this time, when the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has just been promulgated, and people from both countries, especially popular sentiment, are awaiting full and close cooperation, further thoroughly recognizing the essence of the alliance, interpreting it mutually, and jointly understanding it, even more importance should be attached to the cultivation and promotion of popular sentiment. And the return of privately owned property and the lifting of enemy property treatment are truly one aspect that should be paid attention to and put into practice at present.</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of principle, since the property of the enemies, Britain and the United States, has been transferred to Chinese management, then it seems that the private property of the Chinese people, which no longer has any enemy factors, should all the more be returned. Therefore, we believe that no matter from which aspect one speaks, at this moment when Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage, a renewed review of the private property of the Chinese people that no longer has enemy connections should be carried out promptly, and its return should be implemented. We firmly believe that the allied authorities will certainly consider this and that implementation will be seen in the near future.</p>
<p>Based on the sincerity of knowing everything and saying everything, and feeling inspired by the recent wise move of our ally Japan to return British and American enemy property, and also deeply touched by the new feeling of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, we are speaking frankly, urgently hoping that the relevant authorities will quickly consider this and implement it as soon as possible. It can certainly be predicted that Chinese people's feelings towards Japan will become even closer as a result!</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Announced Yesterday Amendment to Wartime Administrative Powers Prime Minister's Authority Strengthened to the Highest Degree</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) The three new ministries established by the Japanese government, including the Ministry of Military Supplies, were officially announced to be established today, and at the same time, the "Special Ordinance on Amendment to Wartime Administrative Authority" was promulgated. According to this ordinance, the authority of the Prime Minister has been strengthened to the highest degree, becoming the responsible person in charge of national affairs in name and in fact. The two key points of the amendment are as follows: First, the Prime Minister's authority was previously limited to issuing necessary instructions to ministers of various ministries only when it was necessary to increase the production of key military supplies such as steel, coal, light metals, ships, and aircraft. This time, in addition to adding the two items of "ensuring the main food supply" and "thoroughly strengthening air defense," there is also the provision that "it is especially necessary for the expansion and implementation of other comprehensive national strength." Accordingly, the Prime Minister's authority to issue instructions has been strengthened to the highest degree. Second, the subjects of the Prime Minister's instructions were previously limited to four items: labor, materials, power, and funds. This time, food, facilities, and transportation were added, totaling seven items. The Prime Minister may also exercise his powers when necessary for the two items of food and transportation. In addition, various measures necessary for increasing production, such as building factories and establishing dormitories for labor personnel, have also been unified under the authority of the Prime Minister. In addition, due to the reform of the administrative organization, the Planning Board was abolished, so the "comprehensive adjustment of national policy matters in both material and spiritual aspects and the comprehensive review of administration" of the board were also transferred to the Cabinet for management. The Cabinet has newly established a Cabinet Councilor system to handle these two types of matters, placing four councilors (one of whom is appointed by Imperial Order), one full-time engineer, and two full-time executive officers, all of whom are directly subordinate to the Prime Minister as the advisory body for various departments such as economy, internal affairs, and culture. Furthermore, along with the reform of the central administrative organs, measures were also decided to strengthen and improve the local administrative structure with the aim of strengthening the functions of the local administrative councils. The content is to strengthen the position of the council chairmen. The key points are: Previously, the governors who also served as the local administrative council chairmen had the authority to instruct local officials in the relevant localities when it was necessary for the comprehensive liaison and coordination of administration. Now, according to this new measure, they also have the authority to directly instruct the heads of special offices of other ministries in the localities. According to the new measures, the council has become an auxiliary organ of the ministers of various ministries, enabling the chairmen to assist the ministers in exercising their auxiliary powers. This type of authority is divided into formally delegated authority and authority exercised in fact. In addition, in order to strengthen the subordinates of the council chairmen, in addition to the current local councilors, advisors will be newly established.</p>

<h3>Minister Lin and President Amau Hold Exchange Broadcast Yesterday To Enable the People to Understand the True Meaning of the Sino-Japanese Alliance</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) Propaganda Minister Lin and Japanese Information Bureau President Amau held an exchange broadcast yesterday (the 1st) from 7:30 PM to 7:50 PM to celebrate the Sino-Japanese Alliance. Propaganda Minister Lin, under the title "Respectful Address to the People of Allied Nations," expressed respect and deep gratitude to the allied nations. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Minister Lin's Speech</h3>
<p>Today, brothers are very excited to be able to stand in the position of the allied nation to broadcast. First of all, I would like to express my greatest respect and deepest gratitude to the government authorities and the people of the allied nation for the revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and for the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday at 11:00 AM, I announced the full text of the Alliance Treaty to all the people of China, and then respectfully requested Chairman Wang's instructions. From that time on, all the people of China gathered from the broadcast to listen to the contents of the treaty, especially the Chairman's instructions. Every word and every sentence deeply penetrated the hearts of everyone, and everyone was grateful, excited, and encouraging themselves.</p>
<p>Equal Footing for Signing the Treaty</p>
<p>What is appreciated is that your country, as early as the end of the 27th year of the Republic, solemnly declared your country's sincerity, in China's prosperity. Afterwards, the National Government returned to the capital, and step by step, aided the enemy country on the road to revival. By the time of the Greater East Asia War, you expelled the evil bandits who had invaded East Asia and the British and American aggressive forces that had bullied and oppressed us for a century from our country's territory. When our country joined the war, your country, in the spirit of even more morality, returned the concessions, abolished extraterritoriality, and assisted our country in completing the necessary conditions for becoming an independent and sovereign nation. Now, further, not only do you not regard yourselves as the victor, but you sign a treaty on an equal footing, with a spirit of mutual benefit and mutual assistance, and form an alliance with us to share life and death. This is the only peace in history that is in accordance with justice, and it is also the only alliance in history that is based on morality. The people of China are filled with so much gratitude for your country's practical sincerity that the two words "gratitude" cannot express even a fraction of their feelings.</p>
<p>Concrete Realization of Independence and Sovereignty</p>
<p>What is exciting is that with your country as the vanguard against aggression in East Asia, it can create a new era of coexistence by eliminating the old roots of exploitation. Our country, with the assistance of your country, has finally gained a solid foundation for the concrete realization of independence and sovereignty in the war of liberation in East Asia. All the people of China are not only excited, but also feel that the brightness of China's future and the brightness of East Asia's future cannot be expressed by the two words "excitement" alone.</p>
<p>We are not only grateful, we are not only excited, but we are also encouraging ourselves. We want to share the responsibility of the Greater East Asia War, we want to fulfill the duties of our comrades-in-arms, we want to put the treaty of the alliance into practice, and we want to stride onto the great road of China's independence and sovereignty and the victory of the Greater East Asia War, relying on our own efforts to be a comrade-in-arms with your country who shares life and death, and a strong ally in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>This is not only our determination and the efforts we should make, but we are confident that the majority of Chinese citizens in Chongqing will also do the same. The proof of the facts will inevitably come.</p>
<p>Let us join hands, bring out the same blood sincerity as the soldiers charging on the front line, the same frugality, the same diligence and public service, and the same sacrifice of the individual in exchange for national independence and sovereignty, and in exchange for the co-prosperity and liberation of East Asia.</p>
<h3>President Amau's Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) President Amau of the Information Bureau, to celebrate the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, exchanged broadcasts with Propaganda Minister Lin of the National Government at 7:00 PM. The main points of President Amau's speech are as follows: It has been three years since the National Government returned to the capital, and the revival of the National Government has been progressing day by day. The Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, in accordance with all circumstances, has exerted a great guiding force. Especially after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in December of the 10th year of Showa (30th year of the Republic), the situation in East Asia has entered a new stage. The Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty has become a bedrock for the construction of Greater East Asia in name and in fact. In Greater East Asia, Myanmar and the Philippines have successively gained independence, and the Provisional Government of India has also been established. Other ethnic groups have also advanced to the stage of political participation. The various countries of Greater East Asia are gradually restoring their original features. These facts are all manifestations of the rise of the various countries and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Leaps and Bounds in Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>At the same time, we must know that the firm alliance between China, Japan, and Manchukuo is the firmly immovable central core. Afterwards, with the evolution of the world situation, it has promoted the leap and bound progress of the relations between China and Japan. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government declared war on the United States and Britain. Therefore, China's responsibility for the construction of Greater East Asia has become even greater. Our country immediately fulfilled the Basic Treaty, returned the concessions, assisted in the recovery of the public concessions, embassy areas, and abolished extraterritoriality, steadily realizing its new policy towards China. The National Government also adapted to our country's policy and made every effort to improve the domestic situation and has achieved remarkable results. Now, in order to adapt to this new situation, the two countries will fundamentally revise the Basic Treaty. This time, we will conclude this Alliance Treaty. The contents of the New Alliance Treaty are: 1. Mutually respect autonomy and independence; 2. Cooperate with each other to build Greater East Asia based on morality and ensure stability; 3. Implement mutually beneficial economic cooperation; 4. Slightly after the end of the state of war, the completed matters will be adjusted, and troops will be withdrawn. This can be said to be a great charter for building Greater East Asia and reviving Asia.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Cooperation to Protect East Asia</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Chinese Nation, once advocated Pan-Asianism, advocating that Asia is for Asians. He said that China must complete its own independent nation and at the same time hope that Japan will give up the so-called unequal treaties so that China and Japan can cooperate forever and protect East Asia together. These words were extremely ardent and sincere, but Yu still colluded with the United States and Britain, causing East Asia to be reduced to a state of slavery. Now, the so-called unequal treaties no longer exist between China and Japan. The National Government and Japan jointly defend East Asia and jointly strive to rebuild East Asia. Mr. Sun must also be filled with emotions in the ground. Now we are carrying out a large-scale and heroic war while constructing Greater East Asia. This is indeed based on a great ideal, but it is also by no means an easy situation. However, we will persevere to the end with the belief of inevitable victory to strive for the final victory, so that Greater East Asia will completely escape the extreme oppression of the United States and Britain, to ensure the peace of East Asia, and to build a new world based on morality. This is what we are working on.</p>
<h3>Our Country Acknowledges The Provisional Government of India: Foreign Minister Chu's Telegram to Bose Declaring</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Provisional Government of India has been formally declared established. Henceforth, the Greater East Asia sphere will have another strong ally to assist in completing the Greater East Asia War. It is deeply believed that the task will surely be accomplished. The National Government's Foreign Minister Chu telegraphed Chairman Subhas Chandra Bose, representing the National Government in declaring recognition of the Provisional Government and expressing heartfelt congratulations. The original telegram is as follows: To His Excellency Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, having received your telegram, I am delighted to learn that Your Excellency is jointly building East Asia, undertaking a great mission, leading the Indian people in striving for independence and freedom, establishing a Provisional Government, and resolved to participate in the war. The long-cherished aspiration of the Indian nation will be realized at an early date. The government of this country specifically telegraphed to declare recognition of the Provisional Government and express heartfelt congratulations. Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu Issues a Statement</p>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Chu issued a statement on the 1st regarding India's establishment of a Provisional Government, as follows: The Provisional Government of India was formally established on the 21st of last month, with Subhas Chandra Bose elected as Chairman, and simultaneously declared the Indian people's determination to resist Britain and America. This move has epoch-making significance in the history of India's independence movement and is a brilliant achievement in the process of East Asian construction.</p>
<p>India has suffered from the oppression and exploitation of British imperialists, leading to the transformation of what was once a prosperous and wealthy paradise several centuries ago into a state of poverty and starvation. The Indian people, unable to bear British oppression, have repeatedly launched anti-British independence movements, which have deeply penetrated the people of all of India. However, these anti-British independence movements have been suppressed by the British government. Gandhi was also subjected to oppression and imprisonment by the British. This fully exposed the hideous face of British imperialists in invading small and weak nations. Since India was invaded by Britain, its territory has become a base for Britain to carry out aggression against various parts of Asia. Many nations and countries in Asia have suffered from the shackles of Britain, just like India. Furthermore, due to its "blood is thicker than water" relationship with the United States, the British imperialists collude with the United States to harm our Asia. Therefore, it can be seen that we East Asians must clearly recognize Britain and America as our common enemies.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to defeat Britain and America, liberate and construct East Asia. Since the outbreak of the war, thanks to the brave and skillful fighting of the Allied forces, brilliant battle results have been repeatedly achieved, laying a foundation for victory. However, within India, the forces of British and American aggression still entrenched there, carrying out exploitation and oppression. Therefore, as the Greater East Asia War progresses to this day, liberating India remains an inevitable step. Allied Prime Minister Tojo has expressed his support for India's independence. Now that the Provisional Government of India has been born and has decided to emphasize combat organization to realize its ambition of advancing a new policy.</p>
<p>The entire Greater East Asia region is now filled with a thriving atmosphere. Our country, with the enthusiastic assistance of our ally Japan, has had its concessions returned and extraterritorial rights abolished, realizing its long-cherished dream of independence and autonomy. Burma and the Philippines have also achieved glorious independence with the assistance of our ally Japan. Now India has also begun to embark on the path of independence. From now on, the hundreds of millions of people of East Asia will unite as one and march towards completing the Greater East Asia War and building Greater East Asia. This is why we cannot contain our heartfelt celebrations upon hearing of the establishment of the Provisional Government of India.</p>

Mr. Koike then delivered a speech, stating roughly: With the assistance of the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, the Modern Japanese Plastic Arts Culture Exhibition will be held in Shanghai, which will contribute to the exchange of Sino-Japanese culture in the future.</p>
<h3>Salary Increase Measures for Municipal Elementary School Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>The municipal elementary school teachers and staff of this city have requested the municipal government and the Education and Finance Bureaus to increase their salaries starting from August of this year, as their current salaries are too low to maintain their livelihoods. This request was submitted by representatives dispatched last month, and the municipal government submitted it to the municipal meeting for discussion, which approved it in principle. The measures were to be handled by the Education and Finance Bureaus. After detailed statistics and reference to the city's financial situation, the Education and Finance Bureaus have agreed on salary increase measures, which have been submitted to the municipal government. It is proposed that starting from October of this year, the salaries of municipal elementary school teachers and staff will be increased. In addition to the recently announced salary of 330 yuan, each person will uniformly receive a living allowance of 400 yuan, totaling 730 yuan. The office expenses for each level will be uniformly changed to 100 yuan per month. The required funds will be allocated and disbursed by the Finance Bureau on a monthly basis. For August and September, it is proposed to use the tuition fees collected by each school this semester, which have been approved by the Education Bureau, to be distributed evenly and submitted to the municipal government for approval. The above measures for increasing living allowances and office expenses will be implemented immediately upon approval by the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Nightclubs Operating Past Midnight Receive Stern Warning</h3>
<p>Still Disobeying; Ordered to Cease Operations</p>
<p>According to the Thames News, since the police recently received reports of nightclubs and restaurants in the old West District continuing to operate after midnight, they have been sternly warned. It has been learned that various nightclubs on Avenue Haig continue to operate after the official closing time of 11:00 PM, so it is expected that the authorities will severely punish such lawless entertainment venues.</p>
<p>Implementing Thrift; Limited Closing Time</p>
<p>Nightclubs in the West District used to start operating after midnight, when dance halls in the two districts were already closed. However, after the implementation of the thrift movement, the authorities felt that it was necessary to stabilize people's livelihoods and warn residents to reduce unnecessary waste and control entertainment as much as possible. As a result, the operating hours of nightclubs were limited to 5:00 PM to 11:00 PM, and they must close after midnight.</p>
<p>Licenses Will Be Suspended</p>
<p>Most nightclubs have implemented this regulation after it was announced by the authorities, but some still disobey. Therefore, the authorities have recently paid great attention to this, and may revise the rules today to add punishment measures for those who violate them. In general, those who still operate after midnight will have their licenses suspended and be ordered to cease operations.</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Alliance and Realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Will: Broadcast Speech by Chen, President of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was concluded on October 30th. After the signing of this alliance treaty, the previous Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, together with all related documents, became invalid. Even the Boxer Protocol of more than forty years ago was abolished. Regarding the significance of the signing of the alliance treaty, Chairman Wang Jingwei explained it to the people of the country after it was concluded on October 30th, and everyone already understands it very clearly. In short, from October 30th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the Republic of China has been completely independent, free, and equal, and there are no more unequal treaties.</p>
<p>Eliminating Traces: Two Opportunities</p>
<p>The establishment of this Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is entirely based on the spirit of Eastern morality and on the automatic friendship and goodwill of Japan, for which we should express our infinite respect and gratitude. I recall that after the National Government returned to Nanjing in the 29th year, I was ordered to go to Japan in May. At a joint reception hosted by the Asia Development Association and the journalistic community, I said: "War does not arise in a day, and peace does not succeed in a moment. I hope that people of insight in both countries will continue to work together constantly in the future." Regarding the spirit of Eastern morality, I also said: "In my opinion, this adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations is only the end of the incident and the first stage of the beginning of peace. Eastern morality is the same as Western morality, that is, 'perfect harmony in the heart, mutual understanding without words.' Once conditions are met, it feels meaningless. Therefore, I hope that after the incident ends, Japan will continue to automatically revise the established relations, and China will continue to automatically improve future relations. This is true peace." What is my ideal? At that time, I said: "I still have an ideal that there will be two opportunities for China and Japan to eliminate traces of hostility and hostility in the future. The first is the advent of a crisis in East Asia. China and Japan will stand together on a matter of life and death. The second is that after peace, we plan a East Asian international structure. Defense is centered on East Asia, and economy is centered on East Asia. Distribute defense responsibilities according to the length of the defense line between countries and the size of the population, determine the development of industry, commerce, and resources according to the survival needs and development procedures of each country. Then, each country maintains its inherent sovereignty and shares the responsibility of stability, forgets the traces of this incident, and abandons unnecessary conditions. Then China will truly and permanently be at peace."</p>
<p>Automatically Revising Established Relations</p>
<p>My above words seemed to hope for too much at the beginning of peace, but according to my observation, this is not the case. There will be no true and permanent peace between China and Japan. At the same time, I deeply believe that there are many people with foresight in Japan, both in the government and among the people. They will not think that my words are a luxury, nor will they think that my words are high-sounding. Since returning to Nanjing, no matter how difficult or hardship, I have always believed that China and Japan will have a resonance, and that the nations of China and Japan, with thousands of years of moral nature, will one day liberate East Asia and live and die together. At the same time, I have another idea that while China hopes that Japan will revise the established relations, it must first improve future relations. Therefore, since the start of the Greater East Asia War, China has resolved to participate, because the Greater East Asia War is a war to liberate itself and other East Asian nations, following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will to "fight together with the world's nations on an equal footing." We should participate in this glorious battle in history regardless of profit or loss. And from the time of peace with Japan, we have resolved to take on the responsibility of stabilizing East Asia, not just to be satisfied with Sino-Japanese peace. We should work together with Japan in righteousness and friendship to complete this historically glorious mission.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, Japan announced that it would abolish extraterritoriality and return concessions. Later, it not only returned the concessions under Japanese jurisdiction, but also asked us to negotiate the return of concessions from other countries and the International Settlement. This time, Japan not only signed an alliance treaty with us, canceling the basic treaty, but also went further to abolish the Boxer Protocol. Japan has been constantly and automatically revising the established relations, and has been constantly and automatically improving future relations.</p>
<p>Unite and Strive for Freedom</p>
<p>Strive for Freedom: Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will clearly tells us to eliminate unequal treaties. Now we can comfort Dr. Sun Yat-sen, we can comfort our ancestors, and we can comfort the people of the country.</p>
<p>The first important thing is that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Greater Asianism must be completed. Dr. Sun Yat-sen told us to awaken the masses and unite with the world's nations to fight together on an equal footing. Therefore, we must cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War, not only to support the already independent Philippines and Myanmar, but also to support the 350 million people of India who have not yet been independent. We must never forget the suffering we have endured in the past, and we must not forget Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will. The suffering that Myanmar suffered in the past, and the suffering that India is suffering today, is the suffering that we suffered in the past. The people and soldiers of the region must not listen to the rumors of British and American imperialism. The people of East Asia should unite to fight for the freedom of Myanmar and India, resist the aggression of imperialism, and complete the sacred mission of liberating Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Intensify Efforts and Continue to Struggle</p>
<p>Continue to Struggle: The second important thing is that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People must be implemented. What Dr. Sun Yat-sen instructed us to do in his will, we have only done is to abolish unequal treaties. We have not implemented the rest of the founding strategy, the founding program, and the Three Principles of the People. We must know that Dr. Sun Yat-sen dedicated himself to the national revolution for forty years, and his goal was to seek freedom and equality for China. How can China truly be free and equal? It is impossible without implementing the Three Principles of the People. Now nationalism is only halfway developed, the people's rights are just budding, and as for the people's livelihood, we have not yet even started. If a country cannot be independent, then it cannot be independent. China's industry has not yet developed, its material resources are weak, its education is not yet universal, and its human resources are still insufficient. It is still too early to talk about self-reliance. If we arrogantly believe that the abolition of unequal treaties means that our country is already truly free and equal, then that is either foolish or entrusted.</p>
<p>Compatriots of the whole country, we should still work hard in the future. We hope that the people of the whole country will rise up to promote the [illegible] in the region, realize full peace, and join this struggle for the liberation of Greater East Asia. We hope that the people of the whole country will rise up to support the people of Asia, just like the freedom and independence of China today. We hope that the people of the whole country will rise up, carry on the past and open up the future, implement the Three Principles of the People, revive China, and defend East Asia.</p>
<p>Economic circles Comment</p>
<h3>Praise for the Asian Charter</h3>
<p>Recently, during the deliberation of the cotton budget at the Lower House of Representatives in Japan, [illegible] inquired of the government: believing that since the English and Americans have been driven out of Greater East Asia today, in order to enable the various southern nations to obtain what they deserve based on the spirit of the Eight [illegible] House, we should [illegible] eliminate racial discrimination, [illegible] practice ethnic equality and [illegible] concession, [illegible] implement economic promotion based on [illegible] reciprocity, [illegible] develop and stagnate culture, [illegible] liberate resources, and [illegible] ensure the greatness of the six principles of the East Asia, to ensure the self-sufficient state of Greater East Asia. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Aoi replied that the construction of Greater East Asia is based on the voluntary cooperation of all nations, so we must examine it with a spirit of mutual concession. The six original expectations proposed by Mr. Nakajima should not only be [illegible] in Greater East Asia, but also in the world. The righteous path is without boundaries, it includes all mankind. Greater East Asia is willing to cooperate with anyone who loves peace.</p>
<p>The above space conforms to the actual situation that Japanese journalists praise as the Asian Charter, and believe that its significance is even more than the Fourth Pacific Charter. However, the Atlantic Charter has long been repeatedly torn apart by its drafters, the British and American authorities, so all policy guidelines bearing the spring of the Asian Charter are even more commendable.</p>
<p>The decision of the world war situation at present is more like a military defeat, but a stable economy is more important. The more important is how the people are oriented to internal and external countries. The so-called "ideological war" The victor of "ideological war" must be one who will implement the royal road to the end. The looser must be one who cannot use the royal road. Because the one who speaks the royal road values profiting others, so everyone feels "heart happy and sincerely." The one who is eager to use his own profit, so everyone "dare to be angry and not dare to speak".</p>
<p>The concrete manifestation of the spirit of the royal road is still the stability of the people's livelihood in the place. In other words, it is that the people can live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, those engaged in ideological warfare must not forget the economic environment, that is, the war of stable people's livelihood, which is also the battle for the people.</p>
<h3>Various Industry Evaluation Committees Re-determine Current Price Hidden Matters</h3>
<p>Detailed Price Lists Have Been Printed and Distributed</p>
<p>The evaluation committees of various industry associations in this city, in order to assist the authorities in thoroughly suppressing and leveling prices, have re-evaluated the prices of all commodities belonging to the industry associations from mid-July, based on the current cost of raw materials, manufacturing expenses, and the legitimate profits of merchants, and evaluated the most reasonable prices. It is reported that the re-evaluated price limit has now been [illegible] and the various associations have issued detailed price lists to all wholesalers and retailers. The newly set prices are lower than the original ones.</p>
<p>The various associations with newly set price limits require member stores to have situations where the current prices are inconsistent with the new ones. This time, I am especially afraid that illegal merchants will not sell goods according to the newly set prices, so the report on the newly limited prices is even more [illegible] than before. The various associations will mobilize all staff of the investigation team in the near future, and go to the front desk of each store to secretly investigate. Once illegal stores are found, in addition to expulsion from the association, they must also report to the authorities for severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Group Registration in District 1 Handled by Economic Department</h3>
<p>Regarding the registration of economic groups, the person in charge of the First District Public Office informed the reporter that: "According to the provisions of the Sixth 126th Uniform Announcement issued by the former Public Works Bureau on October 19th of last year, the registration of economic groups or trade associations in District 1 was handled by the Police Department. It is now decided that from November 2nd of this year, the registration of such national groups should be changed to apply to the Economic Department of this office, the Economic Group Management Section for approval. The section was established before the reorganization of the trade union, and its functions [illegible] are to handle all matters related to economic groups, but national groups. Regarding group meetings, they should still apply to the First Police Bureau for permission in advance according to previous practice."</p>
<h3>Strict Enforcement of Stock Exchange Business Regulations</h3>
<p>According to a reporter's inquiry at the stock exchange yesterday, the exchange is ready and will soon officially open for trading. Companies wishing to list their stocks should promptly apply to the exchange for registration. After approval by the board of directors and filing with the Ministry of Industry, the stocks will be allowed to be listed for trading. At the same time, in order to prevent speculation and price manipulation, the business regulations will be strictly enforced. The regulations stipulate that brokers or agents must not engage in the following behaviors, and violators will be subject to penalties such as suspension of trading, fines, suspension of business, dismissal, or other disciplinary actions.</p>
<p>Increased Allocation of Materials</p>
<p>Although the relevant authorities have been trying to allocate the materials and fuel necessary for the production of goods in various industries in the city, the quantities are perceived as insufficient, and a portion must still be purchased from the black market to supplement the supply. This has a significant impact on product prices. Recognizing this situation, the various trade associations will once again request the relevant authorities to increase allocations.</p>
<p>Important Points for Attention and Punishment</p>
<p>The following are behaviors that will be punished:</p>
<p>*   Unsound trading or actions that deliberately disrupt the market.</p>
<p>*   Arbitrary increases or decreases in commission rates or violations of the exchange's regulations, rules, and announcements.</p>
<p>*   Rude behavior in the marketplace or actions deemed disruptive to order by the exchange or brokers.</p>
<p>*   Concealing transactions or underreporting amounts in an attempt to gain unfair advantage.</p>
<p>*   Failure to pay transaction security deposits or other fees on time.</p>
<p>*   Absence from trading at the exchange for more than five or six months without a valid reason.</p>
<p>*   Spreading false rumors or engaging in fraudulent trading to manipulate the market.</p>
<p>*   Attempting to obtain compensation from the exchange through improper means.</p>
<p>*   Violating general business ethics and causing a loss of credit among brokers at the exchange.</p>
<p>Auditing and Registering Trading Records</p>
<p>It is expected that after the exchange officially opens, each broker will report the type, quantity, price, and the names of both brokers or firms involved in each transaction, as well as the date, to the exchange for recording and auditing to prevent irregularities.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Leaders Held Symposium Yesterday</h3>
<p>Convened by the Economic Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>The Economic Groups Management Section of the Economic Affairs Bureau of the First District Public Office of this city, in order to adjust prices in various industries and stabilize people's livelihoods, has been convening symposiums for various industries since last month.

The symposium was presided over by Chen Riping, Director of the Economic Affairs Bureau, and Sui Shiji, Section Chief of the Economic Groups Management Section. Representatives from each industry reported in detail on the production and sales situation of their respective industries, and then discussed in detail the issue of balancing and adjusting prices. The meeting adjourned late.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks fluctuated. The market was generally small, with large investors ceasing to support prices and small investors seeking to sell at discounted prices. As a result, only banking, gold, lumber and cultural stocks managed to hold steady, while stocks in department stores, textiles, real estate, and manufacturing generally fell significantly.

<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Commodities: Yesterday, the market continued to decline. Spot goods are not comparable to futures. In addition, credit has tightened slightly recently. In this environment, the bond market continues to decline, and speculators can no longer take advantage of the market, so they are also withdrawing. The market outlook is expected to decline further. Non-Class C bonds were oversupplied after opening and declined slowly. There were very few fluctuations, mostly straight declines. Trading was very light, significantly less than in Shanghai. Among other classes, only Class A and E saw some transactions. Class B and D were extremely rare. The extent of the decline was generally similar.</p>
<p>Medicinal Materials: As the end of the month has passed, new purchases have increased slightly. Sellers are also willing to sell, so the market has strengthened slightly.</p>
<h3>Preventing Illegal Trading: Various Industries Reissue Entry Permits</h3>
<p>In addition to formulating market regulations for each industry association's market in this city and issuing announcements for compliance, in order to prevent non-members from engaging in illegal trading in the market, all market representatives sent by members have been issued an "Entry Permit." This permit includes the representative's photo and specifies their name, age, and the name of the business they represent for identification purposes. However, the representative must present this entry permit each time they enter the market and must not use any other means of identification. The "Entry Permit" must be reissued every six months or a specified period to prevent irregularities and ensure uniformity. It is understood that various industries have already begun to reissue new permits. Once the relevant members receive notification from the association, they must submit a recent half-length photo and address of their representative to the association within the deadline in order to issue the new permit. If the representative is changed, a letter should be submitted explaining the change. Failure to submit the required information by the deadline will result in the permit not being reissued in order to save effort.</p>

<h3>Japan Enhances Production Capacity</h3>
<p>Establishing Enterprise Series</p>
<p>The manufacturing process of the aviation industry centers on aircraft manufacturers, supported by numerous collaborating factories and subcontractors. The scale and capabilities of aircraft manufacturers must be balanced with those of their collaborators. Currently, while aircraft manufacturers outsource a considerable portion of their production, collaborators are not fully equipped to meet their needs. This lack of assurance hinders smooth operations.</p>
<p>Therefore, assigning collaborating factories and subcontractors to specific aircraft manufacturers and specializing them in particular components is vital for mass production. Recent government initiatives to reorganize the Second Industrial Sector aim at this. During reorganization, the "Liaison System" (Business Joint Body) used by the German aviation industry, along with the Cabinet's previous resolutions on aircraft machine tool enterprises, should serve as models. To establish complete operational processes for each aircraft manufacturer, reorganizing the production structure of aviation-related industries and strategically allocating factories are essential. This setup enables the rational allocation and mutual accommodation of labor, raw materials, and other production factors. Only then can full production capacity be transformed into military strength.</p>
<p>Improving Productivity</p>
<p>Parallel to establishing enterprise series, it is crucial to maintain balanced equipment within production units and improve production processes and labor management to boost productivity. Compared to industries like textiles, the aviation industry has historically placed less emphasis on improving production efficiency and streamlining operations. However, current decisive production demands require fully converting existing production capacity into combat capability, making immediate improvements imperative.</p>
<p>A mountain of pressing issues, including work specialization, standardization, and clear production boundaries, need resolution. Addressing these issues could potentially enable two-to-threefold increases in production with existing equipment and labor.</p>
<p>Work processes should be subdivided to simplify tasks, and mechanical equipment should be allocated accordingly, following the sequence of operations. This specialization shortens training periods for workers and accelerates production. The implementation of the emergency aircraft machine tool expansion program should alleviate any concerns about equipment shortages.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Japanese machine tool industry has historically favored lathes, followed by milling machines. These machines waste materials. Therefore, the active use of molding, casting, and forging should be encouraged to conserve materials.</p>
<p>Unifying Aircraft Types</p>
<p>To fully leverage the aviation industry's existing production capacity, the sharing and exchange of technology should be promoted, elevating the efficiency of all manufacturers to the level of the most advanced. This approach has been successful in Germany, where factories within a network operate under identical conditions and share technology freely. The U.S. has also established an aviation industry representative council, with most aircraft companies joining to exchange technology. This is a valuable lesson.</p>
<p>Regarding aircraft, the unification of aircraft types and control of orders are crucial. Unifying fighter jets and bombers is challenging due to differing operational needs between the navy and army. However, as Lieutenant Colonel Fuda of the Army Aviation Headquarters' Production Section recently stated at a symposium, "Producing one type of aircraft yields a production capacity of 100, but manufacturing two types reduces it to 80, and producing three types results in less than 55." To maximize production efficiency, unifying aircraft types is essential. The U.S. is bravely consolidating aircraft types, limiting each manufacturer to one type, resulting in mass production. Addressing this requires standardizing parts, ensuring interchangeability, and unifying engine types.</p>
<p>Furthermore, reforming the ordering system is a long-held desire of the private sector. The current ordering methods are dependent and lack organic coordination, hindering the efficient mobilization of collaborating factories and subcontractors. Along with establishing an aviation industrial production structure, close coordination with the navy is needed to adjust the ordering system.</p>
<p>Adopting Day and Night Work Systems</p>
<p>To fully utilize existing production capacity to complete production increases without adding equipment, the implementation of a day and night work system in aircraft-centered military factories should be considered. At the fourth Central Cooperation Council in July, Mr. Naota Goto (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) advocated for this, and the authorities fully supported it. The "Concrete Measures for Establishing Aircraft Production Technology" by the Scientific and Technological Review Council also advocated, "To correct the distorted state of various production factors and complete maximum production with minimal equipment, the implementation of a 24-hour work system should be strengthened," starting with metal processing machinery, then machine tool manufacturers, and then full implementation of a day and night work system.</p>
<p>To implement the day and night work system, the allocation of labor, raw materials, and energy must be prioritized. Secondary issues such as factory housing and transportation to facilitate workers' shifts must be addressed. Regarding raw materials, to ensure their effective use and increased capacity due to day and night operation, new equipment expansion plans should be combined with the speed of material design and used as operating materials as needed.</p>
<p>Regarding labor, the quantity needed will be vast due to the expansion of aviation-related industries and the implementation of day and night operations. Filling this labor shortage will require considerable effort.</p>
<p>To ensure the number of workers, the Labor Adjustment Order can be used to limit men's employment and designate prohibited industries and occupations (such as secretarial work and other easy work) to utilize workers transferred or unemployed due to business reorganization. Machine industry is also the most suitable department for female workers, so we might as well use female support groups, and actively promote female participation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the mass employment of inexperienced workers will inevitably raise questions about maintaining worker quality. This can be solved by simplifying work and arranging simple machinery. (From: World Alliance Disappears Volume 24, Number 40)</p>

<h3>After Reading "On the Problem of Coal Briquette Control"</h3>
<p>— Zong Yuan</p>
<p>The author of the article "On the Problem of Coal Briquette Control" published in the National Forum a few days ago, intends to unblock the supply of coal briquettes in this city in order to solve the suffering of the people's livelihood. However, upon closer examination of the proposed plan, it is nothing more than seeking the authorities to approve an increase in the price of coal briquettes. From the standpoint of the citizens, I believe that it is necessary to give this matter serious consideration. According to general rumors, the reason why coal briquettes cannot meet the needs of the market is that coal briquette manufacturers want to increase prices, but the authorities have rejected them. Therefore, the other party used excuses to repair the machine or lack of raw materials to reduce the production of scenes as a means of confrontation. However, the reasons for the authorities' opposition are also based on facts. Since the main raw materials for manufacturing coal briquettes, such as white coal dust, coal for kilns, and electricity, have not increased in price since the spring of last year. On the contrary, the prices of coal dust and electricity have fallen compared to before. However, the retail price of coal briquettes has risen from 25 yuan per dan to 32 yuan and 50 cents. Therefore, there seems to be no reason to seek further increases in profits. Furthermore, the analysis table of the manufacturing cost of coal briquettes listed by the author of this article also needs to be considered. When we study the cost of an item, in addition to observing the individual prices of its raw materials, we must also pay attention to the composition of the raw materials contained in the product, because changes in the composition of the product have a very close relationship to the cost. Moreover, the amount of coal dust and yellow mud used when manufacturing coal briquettes is very flexible, and the cost difference between the two is very different. The quality of the coal briquettes that can be obtained on the market these days is as different from the coal briquettes purchased in the past as heaven and earth. Anyone with any sense should know the reason for this. Therefore, whether the so-called profit of the factory in this article is only 1.469 yuan is also a question. It seems inappropriate to use this cost analysis table as a defense for the factory to increase prices.</p>
<p>At present, the Shanghai Municipal Government is strictly supervising milk companies, and its products have a fixed standard, such as the amount of cream in milk. The purpose of this measure is to seek the health of the citizens. However, coal briquettes are also an important daily necessity for citizens, and although the impact of the quality of coal briquettes on cloth people is not as great as that of milk, it is related from the standpoint of economic savings and morality. Therefore, I think that if the factory really wants to increase prices, the prerequisite is to ensure that the products can meet the specified standards. In addition to strictly enforcing the current price for coal briquette manufacturers, the authorities should also supervise the composition of coal briquettes manufactured by coal briquette factories. If it is found that the factory sells inferior coal briquettes on the market, it should be punished. Otherwise, the so-called purpose of price limits and profit limits will be in vain.</p>
<h3>On the Treatment of Primary School Teachers</h3>
<p>— Yang Jinzhao</p>
<p>National education is the foundation of a country. All countries in the world attach great importance to it. The teachers of national education are mostly trained by the state in specialized schools. Teachers themselves are regarded as a lifelong profession. Since teachers are trained by the state, they are given various guarantees in terms of livelihood and position, so that they can serve with peace of mind and cultivate the future masters of the country. Everyone understands that the continuation of national life depends on the transmission of education; through the continuous transformation of experience, the nation can survive, progress, and flourish. A few months ago, I was very happy to see that the government had a plan for a material salary system, but it has not yet been implemented; before there is sufficient allocation of materials, there is still value in discussing the treatment of teachers.</p>
<p>The Standard of Treatment - I once mentioned it in my article "Starting with the Treatment of Primary School Teachers"... - According to the living conditions in Shanghai, the minimum living expenses for each person are 500 yuan, and the treatment of primary school teachers should be at least 1,000 yuan. Some people say: It's too much to ask for so much, isn't it? But my opinion is: Salary is normal income, used for legitimate purposes. Primary school teachers have the responsibility of teaching, and do not ask about external affairs except for children. Salary is their only money for life. When the salary differs too much from the current situation, they can only leave. All primary school teachers agree with Mayor Chen's advocacy of "clean government," and are indeed practitioners. We hope that the salary will be in line with the current situation, and those who take a penny wantonly will be punished with the death penalty.</p>
<p>Categories of primary schools - classified in great detail, primary schools are divided into two types: private and municipal primary schools. The treatment of ordinary private primary school teachers is more than 500 yuan. This time, the Municipal Education Association subsidized private primary and secondary school teachers with a monthly subsidy of 500,000 yuan. It is said that there are more than 800 private primary schools in the city. As of the registration deadline, only more than 300 schools have declared subsidies. It can be seen that the threat to the lives of private school teachers is not as serious as that of municipal schools, and they are waiting to be fed. At present, except for the first and eighth districts of municipal schools, a small part has been assigned to district schools, leaving 72 schools. The minimum treatment for teachers is only 220 yuan per month, which is more than double the actual living situation of individuals. The education community has formed this unfortunate phenomenon, which is caused by a complex social environment. Lu Xun said: "The road is made by people!" We must break the current deadlock!</p>
<p>The Planning of Income Everyone cannot deny that Mayor Chen and Director Lin are wise leaders. They have spent a lot of effort on the salaries of primary school teachers. The most important point is probably that they can't bear to increase the burden on the people. However, I believe that as long as they are conscientious and pay attention to the future of China, no one will object. The feast donation is a tax to subsidize education funds. I don't know if it is enough to increase the treatment of teachers. Every education worker is eager to know. If it is not enough, the fare for public vehicles can be increased slightly to pay the road donation. There are a lot of "taxi" fares in Shanghai. If each ticket is increased by a few corners, it can be used to fund a business that is planned for the future of the nation. It is good to take directly from the people and use it for the people. The corresponding rights and obligations are exactly the same. Besides, there are many precedents in other countries!</p>

<h3>The Kwong Siew Association Cultivates Impoverished Students from its Native Place</h3>
<p>The Standing Council of the Kwong Siew Association sent a letter yesterday: Our association has always been committed to the welfare of our fellow villagers, such as medical, academic, and mountain villas, and we have always done our best within our capabilities. Since the incident, the original hospitals, schools, and mountain villas have been requisitioned, destroyed by artillery fire, or forced to move due to environmental reasons, resulting in temporary suspension. Now, in addition to organizing and running the Kwong Siew Free School, Kwong Siew Public School, and Kwong Siew Girls' School, our association also plans to expand the number of students in the free school or add vocational and worker's night schools. However, the houses we own are mostly occupied by other people, and once negotiations for return are made, they will be organized separately. As stated in the declaration of our association's Chairman Wen Zongyao, our service to our fellow villagers and the promotion of our guiding principles are clearly expressed. All our fellow villagers should understand this. At a time when prices are high and life is difficult, all impoverished students should practice a skill to support themselves, especially in agriculture and industry. Our association lacks equipment for agriculture and industry. We intend to follow the example of the China Banking Corporation entrusting the News to act as the agent for the banking science student aid fund. We will propose 25,500 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes from the academic affairs expenses of our association to be used to help students with the following qualifications. We have long admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for obligations. If your family accepts, we will offer the full amount twenty days before the tuition fees are due for the next semester. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>(Qualifications) Limited to fellow villagers from Kwong Siew who have been registered with this association or their children who are interested in learning agriculture or industry and are troubled by their impoverished family circumstances (if not registered, they must be introduced by two or more current directors or supervisors of this association before applying to your newspaper) (Quota) The quota for agricultural science is tentatively set at 15, and the quota for industrial science is tentatively set at 20 (regardless of gender and age) (Amount) Each agricultural science student will receive 700 yuan, and each industrial science student will receive 500 yuan (Note) Regarding the agricultural science project, our association has contacted Mr. Yue Runtin, the person in charge of Dahua Qizhi Company located in Datang Town, and has made arrangements.</p>
