<h3 id="c1">肅清和平區內的失敗主義者 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自從　汪主席發表「艷電」，主張和平以來，忽忽四年有餘，而國府還都也已二年多了。其間爲效忠和運而殉難的志士，不知凡幾；爲獻身和運而不避鋒鏑，出生入死的工作人員，更不可勝數。處身此時此地，不難推想彼時彼地的環境險惡，而益以辛苦奮鬥爲難能可貴了。</p>
<p>經過這一段奮鬥過　，發揚了和運理論的準確性，漸漸移轉一般人懷疑戒懼的心理，趨向於認識而接受的態度，這是和平運動一部分成功的地方。可是和平運動的目的，是在整個中國與日本之間的全面和平，所以必須消滅重慶政權依賴英美的心理，無法繼續拖戰，以整個中國的力量，與日本協同完成大東亞戰爭的勝利，復興新中國，重建新中國，這纔是和平的眞諦，和平運動全部的使命。我們感於這一使命的重大，與任務的艱巨，不但需要不斷奮鬥的精神繼續努力，同時，更需要隨時反省與檢討所以未能迅速達成使命的原因所在。</p>
<p>我們如作冷靜的各方面的觀察，目前在和平區域以內，一般人尤其是黨政人員中間對於和平信念，還嫌缺少堅定性。就少數從政者的行爲來說，直到今天，還根本不了解和平眞諦，更說不上若何信念。因爲他們誤認目前不過是過渡時代的現象，暫時的局面，具此心理，於是利用機會，作混水撈魚的勾當。這輩人，雖不是領導人物，却都佔據各機關要津，憑藉職位爲掩護。以行利令智昏之舉。發表談話，一片爲民爲國，而實際行爲，盡得其反。於是，大多數人民的觀感，就發生了反響的作用。所以國民政府爲取得廣大人民堅定的和平信念，順利促成全面和平工作，對於此輩和平失敗主義者或是動搖份子，實有加以肅淸與制裁之必要。</p>
<p>更就大多數人民而言，對於和平眞諦，容有未盡瞭解之處，固難遽責其有堅定之信念。可是，要大多數人民瞭解和平眞諦，而發生堅定信仰，實非難事，端在政府能否把握人民最需要者而滿足之。人民最需要者，能令滿足，則政府一切政策政令，人民自必擁護，自必服從。反之，人民最需要者，不令滿足，人民一有懷疑，雖多方解釋，迫使服從，恐收效甚微。然則，人民最需要者，究竟爲何？日；「安定生活」而已！</p>
<p>國民政府既發軔和運，肩負艱巨任務，必將排除萬難，完成全面和平與復興建國的使命。於此，我們認爲急切需要革新下列數事：</p>
<p>（一）完成政治機構，加强行政效率，這是最値得提出的一點。目前世界上無論軸心國家與反軸心國家，集權國家與「民主」國家，莫不設置人民參政或協贊政治的機構，即重慶政權，也有參政會之組織，－縱使有名無實。因此，我們認爲國民政府政治機構，尙未健全，亟盼從速建立人民參與政治的有實質的體制，上自中央，下至地方基層機構，均有人民參政之機會。這樣，對於政府的政策政令，傳播推行，較爲迅捷；行政效率，可以提高；而一輩和平失敗主義者之足以影響人民和平信念者，因督察而自知飲跡。漸致政治修明之境。</p>
<p>（二）最根本最切要的政治目標，是安定人民生活。徵諸古今中外，任何時代，任何國家之當政者，莫不惟此急急是求。而其國之盛衰興亡，亦莫不以此爲衡斷，這已成爲極平凡極淺近的政治原理。尤其在今天千鈞一髮萬分危急的時候，政府爲了取得人民對於和平的堅定信念，進而協同日本擊滅英美，除了切實做到安定民生，他無別法。最低限度，必須做到比重慶統治下的人民生活來得安定。</p>
<p>爲使人民有參與政治之機會，便於推行政策政令，政府必須健全政治機構；爲使人民堅定和平的信念，政府必須安定民生。而在國內和平運動尙未成功的今日，對於「和平失敗主義」的份子，也就是利用機會混水撈魚的貪汚份子，對和平信念動搖的份子，均爲政府促進和平運動的莫大障礙，譬如造成目前高物價的投機囤積者，以及公務員兼營商業者，政府對於此輩，更應從速澈底肅淸。</p>
<p>在主席在國府還都三年紀念告全國國民書，末後鄭重的說：「最後ｇ　句話，在大東亞全民族總力戰中，我們不能忘記重慶方面大多數被桎梏的同胞，我們必須把他們解放出來，使之和我們站在一起。……」我們對於政府有這樣抱負，殊深欽佩。我們認爲必須先把和平區同胞從高物價壓迫的生活困苦中解放出來，使生活安定了，到那時，我們相信重慶方面大多數受桎梏的同胞，會自已解放桎梏而跑過我們的陣營來，享受安定生活。這樣，纔算達成全面和平的使命。</p>

<h3 id="c2">日內閣局部改組後　重光外相昨日就職　發表廣播演說披瀝就任決意　汪院長朱委員長均致電祝賀 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電日重光新外相二十一日下午二時赴外務省就職。於該省大臣室與前外相辦理交代手續，繼召集全體職員，由新舊兩大臣分別致詞。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電日新外相重光葵，今晚在此間發表廣播演說，披瀝就任外相後之決意。大意謂：余此次拜任外務大臣，實深恐懼。方今世界戰局正着着推進，並已到達最重大局面之時，彼我雙方均各舉全國總力以臨此大決戰，而其歸趨不僅爲日本興廢之重大關鍵，且東亞之興亡亦在此一戰。吾人不論前途如何困難，日本必在皇威之下，誓以鐵石決意突破難局，俾開闢日本之將來今日本之所以從事戰爭，其理由不僅爲日本之死活問題，且爲建設並保衛大東亞而戰，吾人必須達到此目的，以迎渴望已久之東亞黎明。抑復興東亞之大業，爲日本所負之歷史使命，至此在大東亞具有指導地位之日本，務須與東亞各國同其苦樂。又爲博得其敬慕及信賴起見，今後更應加倍努力。最近日本所實施之對華新政策，其精神實亦在此，且東亞各國之共存共榮，實爲復興亞洲之指導原則，故余深信日本以正義布四海之大理想，而能團結全東亞，其意實與此次戰爭之獲得勝利相同。日本與盟邦德義兩國，同抱正義之理想，東西互相呼應，更與東亞各國互相提携，着着向完成戰爭之途邁進。目下軍專與外交混然一件，不僅應以此擴充已獲之偉大戰果，並應以此活用於政治上，以期達到日本所負之偉大使命。當此國步多難之時，駑鈍如余深恐未能負此重任，但決粉身碎骨爲國服務。</p>
<p>南京二十一日中央社電日本外務大臣人事更迭後，在兼行政院長，特於二十一日致電前外相谷正之及新外相重光葵致意，對於中日關係及東亞前途，備致期待。</p>
<p>北京二十一日中央社電日內閣改組後，華北政委會朱深委員長對新任之重光·安藤·山崎·大麻四大臣及天　情報局總裁，巳分致祝電。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電重光大使此次就任外相後，所遺駐華大使一職，因任務重要，故繼任人選至堪注視。現因靑木大東亞相正於南方各地視察中，故衆料將俟渠返國與重光外相協議後，當可決定。至對大東亞各地之外交新陣容，目前因緬甸獨立及增强日泰提携之緊密關係，及加强對華新政策等重要問題，俱待解決，故爲適應此種新情勢，日本對東亞各地之外交陣容，最近或將大事調整。</p>
<p>又訊　據此間各方面觀察，均認日外和雖已更迭，但省內人事，目前將不致有何更動。東京廿一日中央社電　前日本駐華大使重光葵，此次出任外務大臣，實有兩點重要意義：第一，即今後日本大東亞省與外務省之緊密及事務調整，可望更能强化推進；第二，爲以重光新外相之經歷與見識而觀，可推知日本外交將益趨積極。蓋重光氏之就任外相，過去屢有傳說，但限於客觀條件，迄未見諸事實，故重光外交之出現，爲各方面所期待者，實屬當然，又自中國參戰後，日本對華新政策，亦正着着實現。重光氏於駐華大使任內，其所負使命，可謂巳泰半完成。再者日本當此世界情勢中，實急需發揮强力外交，根據此項客觀情勢，此次重光氏之出仟外相，自在意中。重光外相於滿洲事變後，不久任駐華公使，昭和十年（民國二十四年）一月轉任對滿事務局，前年十二月繼本多熊太郞氏之後任駐華大使，參與直至今日新中國和平建設之初期折衝。再就日外務省之內部關係調整而言，則爲今後兩省之緊密合作，推進共同政策，自屬尢可歡迎。日重光新外相自昭　十一年（民國二十五年）六月至十三年九月之兩年中，曾任駐蘇大使，繼於歐戰期中復轉任駐英大使，對於英蘇兩國以及歐洲各地之內部情形，均有極深之認識與見解，故重光氏之出任外相，在此點上，亦爲內外各方所異常期待奢。深信重光新外相既决心出膺重責，定有充分之把握與決意，以推進戰時日本之非常外交。</p>
<p>北京二十一日中央社電日內閣改組後華北政委會管眞賢情報局長對此發表談話，大意謂日政府此次適應現時之情勢，更迭一部閣僚，强化戰時外交及內政之新施策，由於友邦之新政治措置，吾人對中日同生共死之前途，感覺無限光明，於茲特對日政府及大東亞之前途表示祝意。此次重光大使任外相，安藤國務相任內相，允可期待，該兩氏爲日本之內政外交將造成一新局面。吾人希望於新理想中，急速完成建設大東亞之偉業，該兩氏久駐中國，通曉中國國情，吾人確信因兩氏之新措置，中日國交將更趨緊密，相互携手邁進於擊滅英美，解放大東亞之途。</p>
<h3 id="c3">外次周隆庠談話 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>南京二十一日中央社電　日內閣於二十日晚實行局部改組，重光大使榮膺外務大臣，我外交部　長周隆庠氏頃對此發表談話如下：一本日獲悉重光大使己榮膺外務大臣新命，聞訊之餘，不勝惜別之感。同時亦母任忭賀。溯自國府還都之後，先後承阿部特使與本多大使對國府作熱誠之援助與懇摯之同情，使國府於戰後刦餘，得收拾殘燼，致力於復興。迨大東亞戰爭勃發，我國所負之責任更爲艱鉅，內求興復中華，外求保衛東亞，同時應盡其所有力量，以謀分担建設新秩序之重任，適重光大使來華，以其高邁之識見，卓越之手腕，就大局立塲，苦心努力。一方謀强化國府，一方謀兩國精誠協力之道，使我國有分担建設東亞共榮偉業之勇氣與力量，即如參戰以來，由重光大使手訂交還租界及撤廢治外法權之協定，且於短期內一一力求其貫澈。在華租界及治外法權爲中華民族之桎梏，阻撓我國之發展，莫此爲甚，自英美首先强奪此項不平等特權以來，迄今有年，我國國民無不痛心疾首，茲經重光大使之斡旋，及日本政府之援助，得以陸續一一廢除，俾我國得自主發展，此實爲重光大使之偉績。不但於中國復興史上爲最光榮之一頁，且足於中日國交史上永垂不朽。我國政府固深感謝我國人民更永不能忘此次大使榮轉外相，深信今後必能因其在華仟內之體認，而更能發揮其偉大之　負，貫澈其主張，則不特有裨於中日兩國友好邦交，且爲東亞前途亦不勝慶幸也。</p>
<h3 id="c4">滿洲國表示協力 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>新京二十一日中央社電日本此次實行內閣一部改組，使完遂大東亞戰爭之決態勢更趨增强，滿洲國朝野對此表示全面協力，決本旣定國策，積極防護北方邊陲，並强化對日經濟協力。重光外相，山崎農林相，大麻國務相等俱爲各方面所公認之日本政界名流，且具爲卓越之見解，重光及天羽二氏服務外交界有年，對於歐美情勢瞭如指掌，當此大東亞戰爭邁進於決戰階段，對於今後日本之建設貢獻必鉅；且日本此次改組內閣，使國內總力更爲集中，而以新決意使完遂大東亞戰爭之態勢愈益强化，滿洲方面決本建國以來之國策，以一德一心之精神，捍衛北陲，積極協力日本增强戰力，在經濟方面則確立國內自給體制，今後決集中全國總力，以適應日本內閣之增强及完遂大東亞戰爭。</p>
<h3 id="c5">越南當局頗關心 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>河內二十一日中央社電此間各方面對日內閣一部改組極爲關心，認日政戰兩方面之態勢今後將愈趨堅强，尤其更迭外相，乃日本外交與歐洲相呼應，積極刷新軸心外交陣容之表現。此次由重光駐華大使就任外相，以其過去經歷而言，一般莫不信賴，對於日越協力關係上，亦必獲得良好結果。</p>
<p>西貢二十一日中央社電此間政界人士以東條內閣之强化，實日本國內戰時體制進一步之成功：東條首相兼任文相，安藤國務相轉仟內閣，意義尤大：且重光駐華大使升任外相，及天羽氏之就任情報局總裁，實可見中日提携及日本思想戰陣容之劃期進展。</p>
<h3 id="c6">國府最高經濟顧問　石渡荘堵太郎談話　深望各方協助國府澈查囤積　處理游資具體方策即可決定 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>南京二十一日中央社電國府參戰以後，一切經濟建設悉循戰時體制積極推進，允以最近澈查囤積投機，更見政府當局，對於安定民生，復興經濟之決心。記者頃趨訪國府最高經濟顧問石渡莊太郎，以有關戰時經濟各項問題爲問，承解答甚詳，茲分誌於后：</p>
<p>（問）對於查辦囤積投機之見解如何？</p>
<p>（答）囤積物資，雖爲戰時下不易避免之畸形現象，但此。行爲，貽害國計民生至鉅，故此次國府當局毅然下令，澈查囤積投機，實具有重大意義。本人對於國府此種措置，非常敬佩，深盼繼續澈查，以收實效。允望各方全面協助，以期消弭此種畸形現象而安民生。另一方面，抑平物價，增加生產，節的消費，調整配給等，亦均屬當前之急務。故同業公會及一般商人，均應有自覺的精神，須知取巧表面上雖似有利可圖，實則最終受害者，仍爲自身。此外物價之抑平與通貨之穩定爲不可分，各銀行現巳停止放款，以免通貨膨脹，國府對於此事，亦非常注意。中國國民對於此事，更須傾力協助。日本方面自當不惜一切協助，蓋中國參戰後，中日兩國已進入同生共死之階段，日本願協助中國，完成戰時經濟建設。</p>
<p>（問）中國參戰後對增產之方策如何？</p>
<p>（答）戰時增產，必需物資，乃迫不容緩之事。中日雙方均有整個計劃，且已有一部見諸實行，過去上海英美投資經營之工廠，大東亞戰爭勃發而停業，今已由日方移交中國，故中國應利用游資，從事經營。允應置重點於農事，如種子的改良，害蟲的驅除，肥料的改善，使農產品首先增加起來，尤其華中一帶，具有優良的天然條件，最適於農產，如能得有適切之指導，目有良好收穫，然後再使內地之農產品與上海之工業品，相互交流，或與華北之煤斤交換，互以有餘補不足，則裨益於經濟建設，定不在少。</p>
<p>（問）上海游資如何導入增產之途？</p>
<p>（答）關於利用游資，在目前實爲異嚴重之問題，年來游資集中上海，國民政府早加注意，刻正積極籌劃，不久當可決定具體方策，日本方面亦準備協助。至於具體方法之內容，雖尙未悉，　總不外先由農業着手，如開墾荒地，擴充農田等必要事務，此外如能以游資經營日方所移交之敵產，其收獲之良好，亦可預卜。</p>
<p>（問）軍票停止新發行後，對於增進中儲劵之信用，有無新方策？</p>
<p>（答）中儲券之信用問題與物價漲最有關係，物價在漲即易使通貨之價値低落，此爲必然之理，中儲券發行迄今，不僅從無不良現象，以基礎日堅，信用日著，惟邇來物價上漲頗厲，殊有澈底硏討其　結，力予抑平之必要耳。</p>
<p>（問）南北物資交流，有何具體方法？</p>
<p>（答）南北物資交換方法，甚爲簡易，目前北方缺乏糧食，南方可以麵粉運往北方，以資接濟，同時北方產煤最多價仍極廉，南方燃料則甚缺乏不足，故今後須南北雙方有無相通，餘缺亙補，則雙方之物資，可得融合，自無恐慌之虞。</p>

<p>立法院長兼上海特別市長陳公博此次奉命以特使名義訪問友邦日本，業已任務完畢，返抵首都。廿一日下午三時，在立法院會議室接見中外記者團，發表歸京後之赴日談話如下：「本人此次奉命訪日，深承日本朝野慇懃款待，至爲感謝。金在東京之時期雖短，幸能完成使命，自已亦感無限之欣慰。至於余在東京所得之感想，願對各位分述於决，（一）三年前余奉命赴日答禮爲和平使節，今决重至東京，則爲實行合作之使命。猶憶余三年之前，在日本受興亞團體及言論界聯合招待，余會謂希望日本能够不斷的自動的增好巳定的關係，而中國也不斷的自動的增好未來的關係，這才是眞正和平」。此次中國自動參加大東亞戰爭，而日本亦自動的協助中國完成其自由獨立，故此次赴日，對於日本朝野彼此均有已實現共同理想之感想，其愉快之情，有非言詞所能表示。（二）日本朝野在戰爭時期非常緊張，在政府當局，固極勤勞，無片刻之休息，而在民間處處能表現其必勝之决意，與共同刻苦之努力。就配給物資而論，民間均能自動節省，以供給於前方，其上下一致之精神，與全國團結之密切，我國允宜倣效。（三）日本對華不只政策明朗，而且期待尤殷，朝野上下，均引在主席同甘共苦及同生共死之語，以表示對中國之親摯，故本人對中日前途之觀登，兩國關係巳不只爲親摯下朋友，業巳進而爲手足之兄弟。然而我國亦當深省日本對我實爲其一種遠大之理想與在深長歷史上文化交流之結果，吾人允當以日本之待我者待日本，更須以自待者而待日本，愼勿自大，愼勿自驕，務使盡力以貢獻於大東亞戰爭：允須努力更新政治，增加生產，更增進中日間之關係。以上三點，爲本人簡單觀察後之感想，吾人要知中日關係決非單在和平，允非單在於今日之大東亞戰爭，而在於理想相同，目的相同，努力相同，以共同負担今日及明日之大東亞大任。據本人觀察，此次大東亞戰爭完成之後，東亞在未來之廿年間，恐無日不在防衛狀態中，此則允望中日兩國人民，所共同深省者也。至於此次順道至北平，別無其他使命，自還都以來，一二年未嘗至北平一遊，遠在民國二十二年，最後以開全國礦物展覽會之故，至津主持，順便至平，即未嘗至平津兩地，故此决特繞迫一行，訪問朋友而已，住平三日，所感覺者，當局戳力建設，不遺酴力，而人民對於中央之擁戴與南北之物資交流，渴望允殷，最近糧食恐慌達於極度，中央已設法接濟，今後華北更從　　增產着手，以後當可無虞矣。</p>

<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電據華盛頓消息，美陸軍部昨日公佈，去年四月十八日參加空襲日本之所有美機，除一架到達蘇聯外，餘均毀壞，此可證實日本大本營陸軍報道部發言人谷荻少將，昨日所作詳細報吿之準確。據稱空襲之美機隊，係以雙引擎北美式轟炸機組成，由航空母艦黃蜂號載至距離東京不滿八百哩之處，然後出發，參加空襲之飛行員，共八十人，此項空襲之起意，係在日機轟炸珍珠港之一個月後，其時尙爲上校之杜里德爾少將，由志願參加者之中選出飛行員後，即從事三個月之準備，率於佛洛里達州之依格林機塲，完成其訓練，規定美機於轟炸日本大陸之後，即須飛往渝方境內之機塲。但因環境關係，所有各機，均未能達到指定之機塲。其中若干機降於日軍佔領區或中國海岸附近之海上，杜氏本在出發是上午八時二十分，即首前起飛，十三小時後張傘降落於中國境內，另有五人在蘇境降落，已被扣留。</p>

<h3 id="c19">突尼斯比塞大四周　英美軍企圖再舉攻勢　軸心軍凖備還撃有備無恐 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電昨晚德方軍事發言人宣稱，北非戰塲之德義軍隊，現正佔領該方面之主要戰綫，此間各軍事專家一致認爲羅美爾元帥及阿爾寗中將所部各師團，力能固守目前之陣地，以抵抗任何攻勢。就最近數日中之戰事行動而觀，可見英方第一及第八兩軍之攻勢，日見增加，似可暗示英美軍對突尼斯與比塞大四周區域之第一次大規模攻勢，現將開始。因羅美爾部隊之轉移陣地，大的已使英第八軍司令蒙高茂萊將軍，有充份時間，作大舉進攻之一切必要準備，故軸心國之守軍，亦已有備而無恐矣。又據德方宜布，自阿爾阿拉眠大戰以來，在北非被毀之英美坦克車，已達四千輛之多，並非如英方所宣傳之四百輛而已。</p>
<p>瑞士京城二十一日中央社電　突尼西亞之最後決戰，已於昨晚在恩費達維爾開始。英第八軍大舉進攻德義軍，在山脈閒之梯形陣地，但堅强之守軍，已在第一戰中獲得勝利，擊潰如潮之英軍，使其退回原陣地。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據北非前綫消息，突尼西亞戰綫，日來漸現活潑，決戰時間似已迫近。英第八軍連日於恩費達維爾南方布陣地，十九日終以强力步兵隊，於全綫開始攻擊，與羅美爾軍展開決戰。反軸心軍因軸心軍之集中砲火陣地，受創頗重，惟仍繼續增援猛攻，其一部且曾進抵軸心軍陣地，然二十日晨已被軸心軍包圍殲滅。恩費達維雨防綫，現仍在軸心軍掌中，英第八軍此次之攻擊，是否爲突尼西亞戰綫決戰之開始，現尙不明。又傳軸心軍於西部地區，十九日曾反攻布阿拉達。南方義比爾附近之法叛軍，現已對該方面之反軸心軍，加重壓力云。</p>
<p>羅馬二十一日中央社電有資格方面，授權斯蒂芬尼社發表，軸心軍自瓦迪埃加里特陣綫，撤至現時之恩費達維爾陣綫後，已能固結死守。此次軍隊團結之得吿實現，實得力於軸心軍之作戰精神及技巧。在撤退時，英美軍骨迭冀攻入進行中之德義軍側冀，軸心軍不斷作戰，以阻延敵軍之行動。四月六日晨，敵軍用猛烈之空軍及砲隊準備之後，即向斯貝齊亞及畢斯托亞兩師攻擊，將傑貝爾魯瑪拿及其他陣地截斷，其後又向特里斯師團猛烈攻擊，突入義軍陣綫，義軍爲避免受包圍，即作反攻，結果克復傑貝爾魯瑪拿。因此敵軍沿全部戰綫之攻擊，爲之延緩。軸心軍在西面，西南面及南面，皆受敵軍壓迫，故決定退却，因不欲使軍隊過於疲乏，故決定不作草率準備之連續抵禦，而按照預定計劃，撤退至在恩費達維爾準備完成之陣綫，爲完成此項長途之撤退起見，必須沿埃爾格泰達至埃加里特一綫，與敵軍交戰，避免在麥克那塞地區受包圍，最後又將冀圖突進畢勛及逢杜克之間，而向凱魯安攻擊之敵軍擊破。自英美軍會師之後，敵方自西南面及南面所施之壓力，更爲危險。英第八軍，於會師之後，大爲便利，可自阿爾反利亞之根據地取給供應。四月七日，戰鬥又起，此次並延及北部地區，同時第一軍亦已完成撤退，敵軍與我軍後衛部隊接觸之後，頗有成功，四月九日軸心軍完成撤退，同時逢杜克及畢勛亦發生劇戰。敵軍在逢杜克斯附近突進，軸心軍　不得不決定退至恩費達維爾。北部之敵軍，亦再度向梅傑斯埃爾巴勃攻擊，冀圖目比寒爾達及突尼斯之間通過，雖略有局部勝利，但卒遭德軍所阻。軸心軍撤退至新陣地後，於四月十六日，將來攻？敵軍擊破。大戰現已沿此處新陣地開始，據敵方自己承認，此次戰鬥，將爲極困難之血戰。</p>
<h3 id="c20">英砲隊加緊轟撃　試探軸心軍實力 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>柏林二十一中央社電據海通社軍事特派員稱，突尼西亞橋頭堡南部地段，現時有劇烈戰鬥，此項戰鬥顯已超出乎局部戰鬥之範圍。星期一英軍之許多砲隊，即開始探求德義陣地之射程，至星期一晚，英砲隊即加緊轟擊，星期二晨，英軍父以强大之步兵及坦克車隊進攻，但遭有力之抵抗，戰鬥隨即擴展，至星期二午刻，仍在激戰中。此役是否即係英第八軍開始其在期料中之大規模新攻勢，抑僅係武裝偵察之企圖。現尙難言。蒙高茂萊將軍之戰略，係先作－陣攻擊。然後視其成敗如何，再定立即以大量部隊繼續攻擊或暫時停止戰鬥。在目前之戰鬥階段中，蒙氏極有施用此種戰略之司能，突境西部地段戰鬥，亦似較爲活躍。星期一英第一軍曾數度向高地上之德軍陣地作小規模攻擊，但被擊退。反軸心方面消息謂，安特森將軍，正向德包爾巴前進，同時又謂其祚梅傑斯埃爾巴勃西北之山嶺間，與德軍山戰部隊作戰，實屬自相矛盾。在德軍之側翼，尙存在此處山嶺間時，英軍若向德包爾巴前進，，實屬不合理，或不審愼。英軍將領，似不致出此。美軍除遣派一兩師之部隊，參加英第八電後，又有部隊參加英第一軍，此誠値得注意。美第五軍，目前似不將自成獨立之單位而作戰。</p>
<h3 id="c21">日駐蘇外交官將遷回莫斯科 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>庫　希夫二十日中央社電　本日建息，最近日高已興蘇聯外圍僑民局接洽完竣，將日本之駐軍及海軍武官遷回莫斯科。日本海離軍武官係一九四一年蘇聯在庫壁希夫設立臨時京城時。偕日大使館之其他官員遷來此間。日本大使館官員及此間其他外國外交家現時雖仍未接獲蘇聯政府之正式通知，但預料皆將於本年夏季遷回莫斯科。</p>

<p>日內瓦二十日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，據華盛頓今日消息，日陸軍省佐藤賢了少將，所發表日本現能實行攻擊美國大陸之言論，已引起美國甚大之驚惶。佐藤少將所稱，美國一般人尙未明瞭所謂美國技術上之優越，已成過去陳跡云云。適與西南太平洋反軸心軍總司令麥克沃塞，及澳總理寇丁所稱，澳洲直接受日本攻擊威脅之警吿，不謀而合。又據華盛頓消息靈通人士鄭重聲言，就太平洋之戰局而論，其發展雖斷然有利於日本，但美國民衆對之似乎過於漫不注意，日本强有力之空襲，巳使澳總理對於錯誤之樂觀主義，再發警吿。據最近澳洲消息，所羅門及新幾內亞美軍現有之最大危險，即爲其戰鬬力量，惟有供應不斷始克保持，目前美海軍運輸船因常遭日機之轟炸，反軸心　高指揮部，已不再否認日本南太平洋之空中優勢矣。</p>

<p>（〇〇基地平手海軍報道班員發）猶憶去年六月七日日本〇〇潛水艦曾遠在中途島的北方洋面上擊沉美國的克鎭York-town巨型航空母艦一艘，建樹了不朽的偉動，而獲得了開戰以來最初的感狀。以下所記的是該潛水艦長襲擊航空母艦的手記。</p>
<p>伊號弟〇〇潛水艦，參加中途島戰役，自去年六月初起，擔任監視該島四周及砲擊敵航空基地的任務。至六日傍晚，受到擊沉業已被我海軍航空部隊擊傷而漂流於中途島北方的敵航空母艦的克鎭型的命令，立即向指示的地點急航。至七日晨光微熹時，在遙遠的洋面上，發見該艦由教艘護衛的驅逐艦拖曳着徐徐地航行中。的克鎭型的周圍，配有護衛的驅逐艦數艘，警戒極爲嚴密，加以天氣晴朗，風平浪靜，欲到達極近距離，頗爲困難，我潛水艦嚴密管制音響，甩胆大心細的行動，三次通過警戒驅逐艦的艦底，終於按照預定計劃迫近最短距離，發射正確的魚雷，巧妙地擊沉了敵航空母艦，時爲午前十時三十分。然而在發射魚雷之後，敵驅逐艦立即加以猛攻，歷四小時之久，迨我艦浮出水面，尙受到追踨的砲擊，因沉着而機警的回避處置，終於脫離危機，大功吿成。</p>
<p>我艦自中途島作戰一開始起，即在該方面附近搜索敵艦。六月六日，被我空軍奇襲擊傷的航空母艦，在中途島北方〇〇俚附近，發生傾側而漂流。我艦受到擊沉的命令，於翌日未明時到達，遂用高速度向所指示的地點急航。至七日午　〇〇時〇〇分，到達預定地點時，瞭望員即通知「看見黑點」。這是最初的發見，之後又發見了另一黑點。這時候航空母艦向〇〇度方向航行，本艦乃於其後方〇〇米潛航，視綫逐漸明瞭，辨出空母正向左傾側。遂決定從左方襲撃而進行適當的襲擊距離。</p>
<p>飛行甲板上不見有轟炸的穴跡，亦沒有曾發生火災的模樣，我想或許是被魚雷襲擊而發生傾側，遂立即命令防禦深水炸彈，完成電燈的處置等艦內準備。周圍有敵驅逐艦五艘，二艘在其前，警戒極爲嚴密。天空晴朗，僅有五米風速的東風，波浪平坦，正是絕好的襲擊天氣。發見的時候，敵艦好傳停止漂泊的模梯，之後再露頂觀測，每决與航海畏作圖中的預料不同，從開始潛航起巴有〇小時半左右了，難道尙沒有行動嗎？開始懷疑起來了</p>
<p>每决用潛望鏡觀測的正橫距離，出於意料之外的漸漸接近，但是方位角却大起來了。於是從左襲擊遂感到困難，不知道敵人究竟有沒有行動的力量。我們姑且判斷其是行動的東西，决計從右方進擊。在橫過敵警戒幕的二小時中，完全不用潛望鏡，僅根據作圖而向扼斷敵前進路的方向突進，不管有沒有被敵發見，聽天由命，默然潛航，敵驅逐艦幾决曾來往於我艦的項上。</p>
<p>潛望鏡中的敵影</p>
<p>〇時〇〇分，潛望鏡中映出了敵空母由驅逐艦二艘曳航而行，在〇〇米附近。最初想在方位角〇〇度，距離〇〇米附近的射點，等待敵人，這時候本艦已經突破敵驅逐艦的警戒網而在最近的距離，未幾，空母未到我艦等候的地點，立即命令「發射」。啊！四次！猛烈的命中的聲音，震動我艦，大炸裂聲　續發生，翻江攪海，震耳欲聾。</p>
<p>發射之前，敵驅遂艦離本緩艦尾僅〇〇米，敵命中魚雷後，倉皇在我艦頂上狼狽遁去，一小時後，從右向左通過我艦頂上的敵驅遂艦，二次投下深水炸彈，之後每隔十分至十五分投下了百發以上的炸彈，但我艦僅〇〇部分發生障碍，繼續採　應急處置，我曾三次巡視艦內各部，艦員拚命求生之熱烈的努力，恰如神的姿態。我不禁在胸中合十膜拜。</p>
<p>至〇〇時，電池的雷力告竭，電動機停止了，空氣也混濁起來，艦內漸漸黑暗，僅懷中常燈尙有點點燈光，恰如我們連命的暗示。</p>
<p>逃出敵艦的重圍</p>
<p>我艦於是用〇〇度的仰角開始浮上水面，機械長到發令所來依照前任將校的指示，命令機關員前後移動，以保平衡，因爲除了浮上之外沒有別的方法可以求生了。假使能够浮上水面，那麼祗有覷準敵的致命要害，用肉彈突擊。不過我們還抱着一綫希望，距離最後一次的爆擊已經　〇分了，大概敵艦已相離很遠了吧，在不安中打開艦橋蓋，登艦橋而望，附近不見敵人，也沒有飛機，僅在很遠的彼方，〇〇附近發見三艘驅逐艦正就歸途而行。空母已經不見踪跡，大概可以確定是擊沉了。擊沉空母，我們的使命已吿終了，隨便在何時死吧！盡人　以待天命而已。當我們想敵驅逐艦尙在達距離未全潛蹤時，敵人也已發見了本艦而開始回頭。</p>
<p>在浮上水面之前，據報吿說：「塞力無，空氣〇〇公斤。」於是趕緊命令充電補氣，把艦尾向敵，全力遁走。我艦發出濛濛的黑烟，從兩弦掩覆過來，把艦影包在烟　中。三艘驅逐艦的中間一艘，沒有希望可以追及，僅左右二只，左面的驅遂艦，被本艦的烟幕所蔽，僅右面一艘，在稀薄的烟幕中，不時隱的可見。〇〇分，敵增加速率，距離漸是縮短。瞭望員通知「近前來了」，艦內的狀况，據　海長報吿，不能再走遠了。</p>
<p>報告完成任務</p>
<p>此次的潛航，就是遝命的末日，我早已抱着這樣的覺悟，所以口頭命令通信長發出「擊沉空母的使命已盡」的完成任務報吿，一面作暗號，一面用電報，迅速發出通知。忽然在潛航〇〇分前曾經通訊的驅逐艦迫近〇〇米。不過小潛航終還不能逃脫。我問電機長。「電氣怎樣了」，答說：「沒有自信。」以戰死預期的我，也不　見可愛的部下同歸於盡。最後的努力啊！再一次的掙扎，以艦內的電力如何爲標準，再度潛航。</p>
<p>深度〇〇中，傳聲管發出聲音說：「推進機慢慢地轉動了。」這不是夢嗎？我這樣付着。聽啊！聽啊！我們終究勝利了。精神所至，金石爲開。忍耐是眞正的潛水艦魂。敵的砲火在後面開始炸裂了，因我艦在烟幕中潛航，所以敵彈不能命中。天色漸漸黑下來了。在我艦奇襲之前喪了膽的敵艦，此次僅威嚇性的投下數顆深水炸彈，從我們頭上過去了。〇〇時，本艦輝耀着勝利的艦影，重復出現在慕色蒼茫的黑闇大海中。（翔：譯自四月十五日東京讀賣報知）</p>
<h3 id="c39">德蘇兩軍夏季攻勢的凖備 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>此次蘇聯的冬季攻勢，德聯兩國同認爲已吿張江了，德蘇二軍的新攻勢，卽將繼之發動。本月四日德國　比茲休將軍稱：「所有軍事試騐中之最大的東西，目前止在準備中。「這當然不僅限於東部戰綫，唯該氏僞以東部戰綫爲决述五戰綫中最堪視的戰綫。這五戰綫即：（一）　部綫：（二）大西洋戰綫；，（三）大東亞戰綫；（四）西北非綫（五）德國及佔領諸國上空的空中　。</p>
<p>目前德　兩國，均等待　至遲在今夏即將在東部戰綫上開始大規模衝突的機會，德國某報以「東部戰綫上擴大中日軍事行動之先驅」爲標題，揭載了下述的　林，電：</p>
<p>一本年春季的降臨，在東部戰綫格外來得早，這不僅終止了蘇聯的攻。內季節　遷的特開迅速，南部　區卽庫彭地區的地而，已趨乾燥，故蘇聯似將在該方面轉取攻勢。但戰事僅限局地的戰鬥。」</p>
<p>該記載又繼稱：德方以庫彭他區之外，全部唐納資盆地的　面已經乾燥，而適合於大規模攻勢。關於此點，茲引用奇特瑪爾中將的「冬季攻勢」一文中的記載如次：</p>
<p>「我們承認蘇聯在此次攻勢中獲得若干成功。唯德國在武器生產競　之外，另又發見新的方法與手段，將使敵人爲之驚異。在戰綫上的蘇聯大軍將無從措手。蘇聯的冬季　勢已成過去，我們已經明瞭蘇聯的兵力並不是無盡藏的。廣大的蘇聯領土，俄羅斯之冬，與龐大的人的資源是蘇聯成功的三個要因。蘇聯之廣大的領土，今冬在東部戰綫曾予紅軍以不少便利。但今年冬天，德蘇兩軍在人的資源上，所受的打擊，是左右戰局的一切要素中最不知底蘊的要素之一。可是似一八二年拿破崙時代那樣陳舊的蘇聯作戰計劃，已吿失敗。因爲這作戰計劃，若用以對付沒有彈力與決斷的敵人，始有效果可言。然而彈力性却是德軍戰術的中心。所以德軍從德蘇戰爭的結果，已經感到與蘇　交戰不能不用特殊的法則。現在並且已經知道了這法是甚麼？樣運用這法則？」</p>
<p>眞理報在本埠新聞上揭載了二則記事，與此有關，極堪注意。其一，指出氣候與地面的條件假使良好，德軍或許隨時轉取新攻勢，德軍　銳師圈數十，今正在唐納資盆地開入戰綫，德國的工塲勞働者，爲了編成新部隊而動員，德軍佔有適於採取新攻勢的地點，尤以唐納資盆地，可以用爲對北方頓河地區，南方高加索方面實施攻勢的據點。激戰卽將開始。其二，今年夏季，蘇聯方面亦將採攻勢，這是出於紅軍參謀本部某要員的手筆，其要旨大概如次：</p>
<p>「今年的夏季攻勢，可把蘇聯從德軍下解放出來。蘇聯將以其機械化師團加以最有利的活用。我們沒有好好地利用此次冬季攻勢的戰果，因爲雪與泥濘阻害了紅軍的攻勢。冬季被稱爲蘇聯軍的攻勢季節，這並不是說蘇聯軍喜歡冬季，乃是每年的準備到冬天始吿就緒的緣故。但今年蘇聯軍在極短的期間，似已完成了一切軍事行動的準備。我們並不忽略德軍的軍事力，德軍是極頑强的敵人，而且大家都知道德軍現在正加速進行對蘇聯夏季攻勢的準備。可是我們知道蘇聯的力與弱點。德軍之所以能獲偉大的戰果者，其優秀的機械化部隊，集結兵力於一個地點，實施集中的大規模攻擊。反之，蘇聯方面則不能迅速移動軍隊於德軍的集結地點，以爲防禦。蘇聯軍隊的機械化尙沒有完成，可是機械化正在迅速地且有效地實施中。」</p>
<p>這一記載，說明了蘇聯軍何以每年在冬季反覆重演冬季攻勢的理由。這與向來的中立國的專門家矛盾，言外之意，暗示蘇聯軍或許在今年的夏季開始夏季攻勢。（沮利希田口特派員八日發－翔：譯自四月十日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>敎育爲立國之本，尤其是小學敎育，爲奠定國民知議道　之基礎，更應積極普及，以增養國家元氣。</p>
<p>我國自事變以來，因受戰專影響，敎育事業處於停頓狀態。自和運開始，國府還都以後，雖經政府當局竭力提倡，已次第恢復，但尙未見普遍發展。單就目前本市小學敎育情形而言，在表面觀之，學校林立，小學敎肯極發達，但本市各校情况與內地各處有不同之點：蓋上海小學除少數公立小學及少數民衆團體設立者外，大都皆係個人創辦，經常開支，均賴學費收入以資維持，比年來生活指數日高，各校之　費亦因此逐漸增加，就筆者所知，兩租界小學之學費，最高者爲一百五十元，最低者亦須八十元之鉅，一般中等以下之家庭，在此高度生活歷迫下，日維三餐，尙不能應付，安得有餘力供給子女敎育費用，因此被擯於校門外之學齡兒童日漸增多。吾人若加以準確之調查統計，本市失學兒童之數字必大可驚人。</p>
<p>社會雖不乏熱心人士，救濟失學之事業，亦相當努力，如申新兩報及各團體助學金之興辦，義務學校之設立，但粥少僧多，限於人數，決不能將全市失學兒童悉數救濟。依照上述情形觀之，目前上海小學敎育間題之嚴重，亦應與物價問煙有間樣解決之必要。</p>
<p>保甲組織不但爲防止不良份子，確定地方治安，同時亦可作爲興辦地方公益事業之機構。市自實行保甲制度以來，脊小匿跡，地方安謐，則自應進一步有興辦公益事業之必要，敎育爲公益之先，本市聯保小事設立，實爲目前之急務</p>
<p>吾人希望上海之熱心保甲工作者，本服務地方之精神，及爲國家培植人材之宗旨，聯保小學得能於短期內使其實現，此乃全市民衆所引頸企盼者也。</p>
<p>今就鄙見所及，略舉設立聯保小學之辦法數條於後：</p>
<p>（一）行政機構：組織聯保敎育委員會，以聯保長及各保保長並就地之熱心敎育者，爲聯保敎育委員，辦理敎育行政事宣．</p>
<p>（二）校數：調查保內之失　兒童數，確定舉校之多寡。</p>
<p>（三）收費：不收學雜費，就可能情形，供給書籍。</p>
<p>（四）經費來源：</p>
<p>開辦費：向保內之商店殷實住民勸募</p>
<p>經常費：舉辦保甲敎育月捐，分定等决。</p>
<p>確定每戶捐額，由甲長按月向住戶徵收。</p>
<p>呈請保甲當局酌量補助。</p>
<p>（五）爲節省開支，辦事人員除敎師校工外，均盡義務。</p>
<p>以上數點，不過就其大略而言，至於詳細辦法，有待於保甲諸公之精密　劃，而趨於完美。</p>

<p>前日糧食部長召集各中要糧食業代表及全國商業統制總會全體理監事舉行茶會時，商統會方面所表示的希望是「商業團體自治統制」。因此，我們感覺到商業統治總會的旣經設文，工商同業公會之正在調整，以至最近銀錢業的積極自動收回放款，無一不是顯示着戰時經濟政策的箭頭，確巳逐漸地在那兒移向自治統制的途徑了。無疑地，這是戰時中國經濟界的一綫曙光。我們　首以待的，就是這一綫曙允的發揚光大，不至丹有一點陰靈，從中掩蔽。</p>
<p>我們會於三月四日的經濟講座中，論及經濟自治統制問題，認爲商業團體，在高談自治統制之中，絕對不當以獲致與保持本身共同福利爲它們的前提，而却當以適應四周環境，促進社會共同福利爲它們惟一無二的使命。此外，自治統制的兩個基木條件是：（一）　够自行管理，（二）能够自行檢舉。第一個是所以發掉人民組織的本能，第二個是所以試騐社會制裁的力量。</p>
<p>所以，我們認爲不談商業團體自治統制則巳，否則兩項嚴格的組織，是必不可小備具的：第一是一個高度强化的評議委員會，其職責爲求物品價格的標準化與合理化，物品配給的普遍化與公允化：第二是一個高　强化的監察委員會，　職責爲進行確實的調查，公開的舉發。這兩個委員會的人選，必須經過最嚴格的甄拔；處於評議者，必須以熟悉商品情况與民生狀態，爲其惟一條件，處於監察者，必須以大公無私，精明强幹，並且無所顧忌，無所隱諱爲其惟一條件。</p>
<p>惟有這樣地去實踐商業團體自治統制，而後商業團體的自治統制，方始可以博得大衆的信仰。</p>

<p>國府當局對於澈查上海的投機囤積，其聲浪徒高，而成績渺小。承辦澈查的當事人，似亦未能充分認識問題的　雜性與重要性，僅僅草率從事，以致不能獲得預定的成績，這是應該自己負其責任的。不過，被檢舉的雖少，其影響決非淺鮮，尤其因爲道决的澈查，而上海投機囤積的全豹，已經明白透露，金融機關所作所爲，亦由此完全明瞭。這是爲中國財界自肅所提供的一個好資料，其意義相當重大。</p>
<p>上海的投機囤積，銀行界涉有重大關係，此爲任何人所明瞭，不過在未澈查以前，沒有現在這樣具體的明瞭罷了。大小銀行，放出信用貸款去做囤積資金，或則設立空頭機關，運用資金，自己經商囤積，這些無秩序的行爲，實超出了我們的預料。藐視法律條例，祇知投機牟利，不顧一切，道樣的越軌行爲，我們不得不爲之啞然失色。銀行資本到投機事業上去尋出路，當然是因爲失去正常出路，然而任憑怎樣失去正常出路，也不應該有今日的不規則現狀。銀行資本，應有銀行資本的規準與限度。脫出了這個規準與限度，當然是銀行的自殺行爲，更暴露了主事者的不道德性　。</p>
<p>據聞金融界刻巳表示自肅自重，不但着手收回不芷當貸款，今後更將中止不正當貸款，自己戒絕囤積及買賣行爲，這是應該慶幸的，尤其是能够自動執行，更値得我們注意。澈查囤積以後收回的資金，據說經銀　公會，錢　公會取回的有一萬萬元，其他方面收回的有五千萬元。此項數額雖屬些微，然而法良意美，是値得歡迎的。這種自肅舉動，如能更進幾步，藉以積極收回一般投機資金，那末比了檢舉，處罰等等來防止投機還要有效。願國府當局注意促進此項自肅運動。</p>
<p>然而，還有一點不得不同時老慮者，就是這些投機資金收回以後的措置。大家以爲因這次的收回措置，銀行的利潤數目，必至减少若干，如果不求其善後措置，恐將誘銀行於再自墮落之途。可是，現在旣有全國商業統制總會的設置，物資流通的恢復，以及健全生產事業的復興等等，那末大家必須從這種觀點上從速入手進行。（雲鵬：譯自四片二十一日大陸新報）</p>

<p>因「名」之重要，於是要「沽」名钓誉，以博一粲。一方面掙着造孽錢，一方却掛着慈悲的招牌，用「名」的手法來掩蓋劣述，道同掛着羊頸，出賣狗肉，同出卑鄙，所謂滿面仁義道德，而居心是毒蛇猛獸。</p>
<p>「名」者實之歸也，默默工作，成績表顯，不要「名」而「名」至矣：若不從事實本身下手，而徒要博一好「名」，即有所成，亦不過若曇花一點「名」而巳，不一刻就要烟消雲散。</p>
<p>「名可求實不可求」。又云：「若日惟孜，以求名爲事，不惜犧牲一切以騖名，則「名」且爲「身之累」矣。」是言。</p>
<p>故「至人者，名可，無名亦可……名也，小足爲我累，我惟爲其所當爲，寗不快哉！」</p>
<h3 id="c71">種痘常識 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 包明</p>
<p>和暖的春天已來臨，也是開始佈種牛痘取合宜的季節，本市當局這幾天爲保障市民的普遍健康起見，設立臨時免費佈種牛痘的地方，並希望每個人能自動去種以免天花的流行。從前黃帝內經裏說「良醫不治已病治未病，」就是這倘意思。</p>
<p>這裏我們略述一點關於種痘的概說：起先輸出於印度，當時是藉移痘法，就是以患天然痘的人擇其得病較爲輕者，剝取他的痘痂，研成細粉，然後以此粉吹到健康人的鼻子裏，使他生輕痘藉資抗毒，賴以免疫；後來經過英國苦心硏究始發明牛痘，得以人工免疫。</p>
<p>嬰孩在生後四月到八月內必須種一次痘，切勿拘時季，因爲在這個時期小兒毫無畏怖，且種後不會搔爬，若種後結果很好，可保五六年不生天花，過此時期當冉種一次，如所種結果都佳，且能得法，經過三次種痘則可保你一生不發天花，亦有在生後十個月種痘，其全出者，則於六歲施第二期種痘；不全出者，就在翌年同時復種，要是仍不全出，翌年冉種。總之，在十歲以前須完成第二期種痘，在二十歲前後施第三期種痘，不過事有例外，總以多種爲妙，如逢天化流行時，無論已種或未種均須一律再種，不必拘泥，至於時間一年四季都可，惟以春秋淸凉季候最爲便利，春三四月，秋九十月，如遇天花發生，則隨時隨地施種，其種後最顯著的是發癢，可是不能任意搔爬，因爲指甲上常有小潔之物，一不留心易致化膿潰爛，或引起全身，局部之潰爛，住房空氣須流通，光綫稍宜暗淡，或利用紅色光綫，最爲合宜。在我國習俗，當小兒種痘後，常頭頂紅帽身披紅布，也就是這個意思。至於飮食方面多取其容易消化的且帶流動性無刺激性的。</p>
<p>人受了病毒本應發病，若是身體內有力抵抗，當然可免除，這就所謂免疫；不過免疫有先天有後天，先天免疫，就是說生來就有免疫的因素存在，後天免疫，就是說生後加以人工處理的方法或因患過一次病而得免疫。其中又可分爲兩種情形，受了病毒而身體無力抵抗或者雖有力而不足抵抗時，則可取他人或動物的血液中含有豐富足够抵抗這種病的物質傘來補充，若是身體內無抵抗力或抵抗力不足時，則可以　化的病毒引種，受種的人是並無危害，而體內漸漸可產生抵抗的力量以防禦該病之傳染，有時患某種傳染病等治愈後身體內亦產生于種抵抗力，那麽以後就再不致重　這種病，亦就是自動免疫。種痘就是利用自動免疫的方法，當種痘後九天到十一天就可得到免疫性，最少可保持幾年甚至幾十年，因各人體質而異。</p>
<h3 id="c72">談「決斷力」 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 叔菴</p>
<p>所謂沒有決斷力的人，就是躊躇猶疑的人。它們一遇到事件，便狐疑不決，做好呢？還是不做好呢？取呢還是捨呢？就開始猶豫起來，結果，却一件事情也沒有動手，把大好的光陰，耗費在這狐疑上，蹉跎到老，他們的一生，在猶豫狐疑中混過去。</p>
<p>有決斷力的人，却絕然相反，他們憑着自己的決斷力，去判斷這件事應該是做還是不做，取還是捨，順着决序有條不紊地工作下去，終於能達到成功的階段。在他們的心目中，世界上根本就沒有可猶豫的事，所以能抓住機會，在短短的一生中，創造出偉大的事業來，絕不是沒有決斷力的人，所能趕得上的。由此看來，聰明而沒有決斷力，反不如愚笨而有決斷力，所以，太史公說：「猛虎之猶豫，不若蜂蠆之致螫；騏驥之跼躅，不如駑馬之安步；孟責之狐疑，不如庸夫之必至也。雖有舜禹之智，吟而不言，不如盲聾之指麾也」……，這就可見決斷力有無的利弊了。</p>
<p>不過，話得說回來，決斷決不是武斷，決斷力是憑着自己的理智自信閱歷，經過周密的考慮而判斷，所以是合理的，決不是草率從事的武斷，全憑一時的意氣興緻，而任意判別。總之，我們需要有決斷力，這是成功不可缺少的潛力，然而，我們應該使用得當，決不可任意濫用而草率。</p>
<h3 id="c73">眼熱與心熱 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 泓英</p>
<p>「眼熱」是與「羨慕」的意義相彷彿的，它是一切成功的出發點；假若一個人因受某一種事物的吸引與刺激，而有「眼熱」的表現，那末，他一定對某種事物發生了興趣，而進一步的有「企圖」和「希望」了。</p>
<p>然而「眼熱」不過是心理上一時的作用，它像一個泡沫幻影，當情緒的高潮漸漸下降後，就會在無形中消滅的。如果把「眼熱」在相當時期中保持下去，使它在心田中滋長着，新的「希望」就會隨着出長的。</p>
<p>有了「希望」，像是在黑暗中見到光明一樣，使一切的一切，都有生機；以往理想中的事情，是有實現的可能性。不過，「希望」祗是「希望」而已，若不努力地促「希望」實現，不是和幻想一樣嗎？因此，在這二者距離的中間，非要用「心熱」來脚踏實地的硬幹不可！</p>
<p>凡是用「心熱」做事，十之八九總能成功的，並且，還能得到一種意外的收穫。一個工作者能「心熱」地工作，猶如枯燥寂寞的沙漠中，有一盞閃耀着的燈，永遠使你向目標追求不懈；它能使工作者冒險地在人生奮鬥的路程上開出新的途徑；「心熱」的人，是不怕失敗，不怕艱難的，他的情緒是始終熱烈的。</p>
<p>因此，「眼熱」與「心熱」也是成功的二個條件；有「眼熱」才能產生欲望，有「心熱」方能把欲望化爲事實不正當的「眼熱」，往往成妒忌，這是非常危險；單單「眼熱」而不「心熱」，這像幻想一樣；若一時「心熱」而不能有「恒」這也是十分的可惜。</p>

<p>— 小窗</p>
<p>人生是一條路，一條長的路。每個人都須從起點走到終點。不過在這路途中，各人都有各人的走法，各人有各人的途徑，有的偷着簡便，擇前人走過的原路不管利弊的仍照那樣的走去，有的巧妙的在找尋直徑，目的是找尋較前容易的路走去，但也有目光遠大的人，冒着了種種危險和一切的因難，在這條路小能走下去的時候，他就在荊棘的山野裏劈開了一條路，他遇見了海，就駕起了一葉扁舟。他到碰了猛獸，就把它驅走，他不但爲了自己，並且也爲了他人，他喚醒一班人，需要大家來創浩新的大道，認淸了眞實的目標。</p>
<p>這是正確的人生。</p>
<h3 id="c75">成功前後 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 寄廬</p>
<p>有人說：「創立是一件非常困難的事」。可是，去維持一件已創立成的事，却是同樣的不容易。在「成功」的階段裏，創立與維持這二個重要的步驟缺一不可。</p>
<p>當任一件事創立的時期必定會遭世人的冷譏熱諷，甚至多方阻難，不使你很順利的得到「成功」。待你經千辛萬苦得到勝利後，又得努力避免他人的嫉忌，免遭毒手。</p>
<p>這樣說來，要成就件事情，不是太難了嗎？但，並不像所說的那麼艱難。祇要我們把自己培養得有著：完美的品格，深邃的修養，豐富的經驗，那麽，要成就無論什麽事，也並不是十分困難的。</p>
<p>世界上往往有許多人，當一件事已「成功」的時候，以爲這件事已經完了，便不再很關心地去留意它。不料，經好久後，却慢慢地被人遺忘了。那麼，創始者所費的一翻心血，豈不可惜？眞所謂，「功虧一簣，前功盡棄」了。</p>
<p>誠然：「創業維難，後死責任重」。這句話眞説得透切明白。假如只是有創立者創業，而後死者不　　烈們的心血，努力擴大之；那麼所創立之事業，久後亦必一敗塗地。所以，後死者得擔負起維持，擴充的責任。</p>
<p>創立者固然需要決斷力，自信力，毅力，恒心…………等「成功」的要素；可是，維持者亦需要它們。我們切不要以爲只要，隨意地躱在人背後享受人家巳創立成的事業，便以爲可以守成而有餘。亦得有相當識見才可應用他人的發明物呢。</p>
<p>沒有成功前的創立固然不能得到「成功」：但，如果成功後不繼續努力，那麼，所得「成功」將變爲「烏有」了。</p>
<h3 id="c76">天？地？人？ <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 小洛</p>
<p>俗諺云：「天時不及地理，地理不及人和」。這的確是一句至理名言。但，我們可以補充地說：「人和」雖然重要，然而有時不及「自強」，來得收效廣大</p>
<p>試想一個專想依靠友人親戚的人，有否向上之志？他一定時時刻刻祇想人家來幫助他，不勞而獲。不再想如何努力，如何開發，自己打出片天地來。</p>
<p>試想一個專事敷衍交際廣闊的人，儘由他說得如何天花亂墜，儘由他的朋友不停口地說：「一定幫忙，一定幫忙…………，」。如果他不目振作，他的友人會慢慢離開他的。</p>
<p>不是嗎？社會上有許多人，很不幸地，都是在「依賴旁人，不自振作」的情况下被淘汰的。但是，還有許多人，却不自醒覺，像寄生蟲似地苟生偷安醉生夢死。</p>
<p>醒醒吧！黃梁——夢的人們。</p>
<p>我們要努力發憤自强，別人的力量是靠不住的。</p>
<p>「自强不息」！我們把這句作爲座右銘吧。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Eliminating Defeatists in the Peace Zone <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since Chairman Wang published the "Gorgeous Telegram," advocating for peace, more than four years have elapsed, and the National Government's return to the capital has been over two years. During this time, countless patriotic individuals have sacrificed themselves for loyalty to the peace movement, and even more staff members have dedicated themselves to the peace movement, braving dangers and risking their lives. Living in this time and place, it is not difficult to imagine the perilous environment of that time and place, and it is all the more commendable for their arduous struggle.</p>
<p>Having gone through this period of struggle, and promoting the accuracy of the peace movement theory, gradually shifting the general public's suspicious and apprehensive mentality towards a state of understanding and acceptance, this is a partial success of the peace movement. However, the goal of the peace movement is comprehensive peace between the entire China and Japan, so it is necessary to eliminate the Chongqing regime's reliance on Britain and the United States, making it impossible to continue the dragged-out war. With the strength of the entire China, cooperating with Japan to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War, revitalizing and rebuilding a new China, this is the true essence of peace, the entire mission of the peace movement. We feel that this mission is significant and the task arduous, not only requiring continuous effort and a spirit of constant struggle, but also needing constant reflection and examination of the reasons why the mission has not been quickly achieved.</p>
<p>If we make a calm observation from all aspects, at present within the peace zone, the general public, especially among party and government personnel, still lacks firm belief in peace. Judging from the behavior of a few politicians, even today, they fundamentally do not understand the true essence of peace, let alone any belief. Because they mistakenly believe that the current situation is merely a phenomenon of a transitional era, a temporary situation, with this mentality, they take advantage of opportunities to engage in muddied-waters-fishing activities. These people, although not leaders, occupy key positions in various institutions, using their positions as cover to engage in acts driven by greed. In their speeches, they claim to be for the people and the country, but their actual behavior is completely the opposite. As a result, the majority of the people have a reactive perception. Therefore, in order for the National Government to obtain the firm peace belief of the broad masses of the people and smoothly promote comprehensive peace work, it is necessary to eliminate and sanction these peace defeatists or wavering elements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as far as the majority of the people are concerned, there may be places where they do not fully understand the true essence of peace, so it is difficult to demand that they have a firm belief. However, it is not difficult for the majority of the people to understand the true essence of peace and develop a firm belief; it depends on whether the government can grasp and satisfy what the people need most. If what the people need most is satisfied, then the people will definitely support and obey all government policies and decrees. Conversely, if what the people need most is not satisfied, and the people have doubts, even with various explanations and forced obedience, the effect may be minimal. Then, what is it that the people need most? It is simply "stable life"!</p>
<p>Since the National Government initiated the peace movement and shouldered the arduous task, it will inevitably overcome all difficulties and complete the mission of comprehensive peace, revitalization, and nation-building. In this regard, we believe that it is urgently necessary to reform the following matters:</p>
<p>(1) Completing political institutions and strengthening administrative efficiency is the most worthwhile point to raise. At present, whether it is in the Axis countries or the anti-Axis countries, centralized countries or "democratic" countries, they all set up institutions for people to participate in or assist in politics. Even the Chongqing regime has an organization like the Political Participation Council – even if it is only in name. Therefore, we believe that the political institutions of the National Government are not yet sound, and we urgently hope to quickly establish a substantive system for people to participate in politics, from the central government to the local grassroots organizations, all having opportunities for people to participate in politics. In this way, the dissemination and implementation of government policies and decrees will be faster, administrative efficiency can be improved, and those peace defeatists who are enough to influence the people's peace beliefs will know to hide themselves due to supervision, gradually leading to a state of enlightened politics.</p>
<p>(2) The most fundamental and crucial political goal is to stabilize the people's livelihood. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, in any era and any country, the rulers have always sought this urgently. And the rise and fall, prosperity and decline of their countries have always been judged by this. This has become a very ordinary and superficial political principle. Especially in today's critical and precarious times, in order for the government to obtain the people's firm belief in peace, and further cooperate with Japan to defeat Britain and the United States, there is no other way but to earnestly achieve stable people's livelihood. At a minimum, it must be more stable than the lives of the people under the rule of Chongqing.</p>
<p>In order to give the people the opportunity to participate in politics, to facilitate the implementation of policies and decrees, the government must improve political institutions; in order for the people to firmly believe in peace, the government must stabilize the people's livelihood. And in the current situation where the domestic peace movement has not yet succeeded, the "peace defeatist" elements, that is, corrupt elements who take advantage of opportunities to muddy the waters, and those who waver in their belief in peace, are a great obstacle to the government's promotion of the peace movement. For example, the speculators and hoarders who cause the current high prices, as well as public officials who engage in business, the government should thoroughly eliminate these people as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In the end of Chairman’s letter to the national people on the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, he solemnly said: "Finally, one sentence, in the total war of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, we cannot forget the majority of our compatriots in Chongqing who are in shackles. We must liberate them and make them stand with us. ..." We deeply admire the government for having such aspirations. We believe that we must first liberate our compatriots in the peace zone from the oppression of high prices and the hardship of life, and stabilize their lives. By then, we believe that the majority of our compatriots in shackles in Chongqing will liberate themselves from the shackles and run to our camp to enjoy a stable life. In this way, the mission of comprehensive peace will be achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e2">After the Partial Reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Assumed Office Yesterday, Delivered a Broadcast Speech Expressing His Determination Upon Assuming Office, Premier Wang and Chairman Zhu Sent Congratulatory Telegrams <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Japan's new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu assumed office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2 p.m. on the 21st. In the Minister's office of the ministry, he completed the handover procedures with the former Foreign Minister, and then convened all the staff, with the new and old ministers delivering speeches respectively.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Japan's new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Kui delivered a broadcast speech here tonight, expressing his determination after assuming the post of Foreign Minister. The gist is as follows: I am deeply afraid of being appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs this time. The world war situation is now advancing step by step, and has reached the most important stage. Both sides are using their national strength to face this decisive battle, and its outcome is not only a major key to the rise and fall of Japan, but also to the rise and fall of East Asia. No matter how difficult the future is, Japan will swear to overcome the difficult situation with iron will under the imperial prestige, so as to open up the future of Japan. The reason why Japan is engaged in war is not only a matter of life and death for Japan, but also to build and defend Greater East Asia. We must achieve this goal to welcome the long-awaited dawn of East Asia. Moreover, the great cause of the revival of East Asia is the historical mission borne by Japan. At this point, Japan, which has a leading position in Greater East Asia, must share weal and woe with the countries of East Asia. In order to win their admiration and trust, we should make redoubled efforts in the future. The new policy towards China recently implemented by Japan is in fact in this spirit, and the co-existence and co-prosperity of the countries of East Asia is the guiding principle for the revival of Asia. Therefore, I firmly believe that Japan, with the great ideal of spreading justice throughout the world, can unite the entire East Asia, and its intention is the same as winning this war. Japan and its allies, Germany and Italy, share the ideal of justice, echoing each other from east to west, and supporting each other with the countries of East Asia, advancing step by step towards the completion of the war. At present, military affairs and diplomacy are mixed together, and we should not only expand the great results we have already achieved with this, but also use it politically to achieve the great mission borne by Japan. At this time of national hardship, I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to bear this heavy responsibility due to my dullness, but I am determined to serve the country even if it means crushing my bones.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - After the change of personnel in the Japanese Foreign Ministry, concurrent Premier of the Executive Yuan, especially telegraphed former Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki and new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Kui on the 21st to express his greetings, expressing his expectations for Sino-Japanese relations and the future of East Asia.</p>
<p>Beijing, 21st (Central News Agency) - After the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, Zhu Shen, chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, sent congratulatory telegrams to the four newly appointed ministers, Shigemitsu, Ando, ​​Yamasaki, and Oma, and the director general of the Information Bureau.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - After Ambassador Shigemitsu assumed the post of Foreign Minister this time, the post of Ambassador to China that he left behind is attracting attention due to the importance of the mission. Now that Aoki, Minister of Greater East Asia, is inspecting various places in the South, it is expected that a decision will be made after he returns to the country and consults with Foreign Minister Shigemitsu. As for the new diplomatic lineup in various places in Greater East Asia, at present, important issues such as the independence of Myanmar, the enhancement of the close relationship between Japan and Thailand, and the strengthening of the new policy towards China all need to be resolved. Therefore, in order to adapt to this new situation, Japan's diplomatic lineup in various places in East Asia may be greatly adjusted recently.</p>
<p>In addition, according to observations from various parties here, it is believed that although the Japanese foreign affairs have been changed, there will be no changes in the personnel within the province at present. Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Former Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu Kui's appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs this time has two important meanings: first, it is hoped that the close relationship and business adjustment between the Japanese Ministry of Greater East Asia and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be further strengthened and promoted; second, judging from the experience and insights of the new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, it can be inferred that Japanese diplomacy will become more active. The emergence of Shigemitsu's diplomacy has been expected by all parties, which is natural. Moreover, since China's participation in the war, Japan's new policy towards China is also being implemented step by step. During his tenure as Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu's mission can be said to have been mostly completed. Furthermore, in the current world situation, Japan urgently needs to exert strong diplomacy. Based on this objective situation, Shigemitsu's appointment as Foreign Minister this time is naturally expected. After the Manchurian Incident, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu soon served as Minister to China. In January of Showa 10 (1935), he transferred to the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs. In December of the year before last, he succeeded Hondo Kumata as Ambassador to China, participating in the initial negotiations for the peaceful construction of the new China until today. In terms of the internal relationship adjustment of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the close cooperation and promotion of common policies between the two provinces in the future, it is undoubtedly welcome. From June of Showa 11 (1936) to September of the 13th year, Japan's new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu served as Ambassador to the Soviet Union for two years. During the European War, he was transferred to Ambassador to the United Kingdom. He has a very deep understanding and insight into the internal situation of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and various places in Europe. Therefore, the appointment of Shigemitsu as Foreign Minister is also highly expected by both domestic and foreign parties in this regard. It is deeply believed that the new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu has decided to take on the heavy responsibility, and he will definitely have full confidence and determination to promote Japan's extraordinary diplomacy during the war.</p>
<p>Beijing, 21st (Central News Agency) - After the reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet, Guan Zhenxian, Director of the Information Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Committee, issued a statement, which generally meant that the Japanese government changed some cabinet members to strengthen new policies for wartime diplomacy and internal affairs in response to the current situation. Due to the new political measures of friendly countries, we feel infinite light for the future of Sino-Japanese coexistence and death. Here, we especially express our congratulations to the Japanese government and the future of Greater East Asia. This time, Ambassador Shigemitsu's appointment as Foreign Minister and Minister of State Ando's appointment as Minister of Internal Affairs are expected.

<h3 id="e3">Talk by Vice Minister Zhou Longxiang <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Cabinet implemented a partial reorganization on the evening of the 20th, and Ambassador Shigemitsu was honored as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Our Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Longxiang recently issued the following statement: I am saddened to hear the news of Ambassador Shigemitsu's honor as the new Minister of Foreign Affairs. At the same time, I am also pleased and congratulated. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, Special Envoy Abe and Ambassador Hondo have successively provided sincere assistance and earnest sympathy to the National Government, allowing the National Government to clean up the mess and devote itself to restoration after the war. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the responsibility borne by our country was even more arduous. Internally, we sought to revive China, and externally, we sought to protect East Asia. At the same time, we should do our best to share the heavy responsibility of building a new order. Ambassador Shigemitsu came to China at the right time, with his lofty vision and outstanding skills, standing from the overall situation and working hard. On the one hand, he sought to strengthen the National Government, and on the other hand, he sought ways for the two countries to cooperate sincerely, so that our country had the courage and strength to share the great cause of building East Asia together. For example, since participating in the war, the agreement on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights was signed by Ambassador Shigemitsu, and every effort was made to implement it one by one in a short period of time. The concessions and extraterritorial rights in China are shackles for the Chinese nation, hindering the development of our country. There is nothing more serious than this. Since Britain and the United States first forcibly seized these unequal privileges, it has been many years, and all the people of our country are heartbroken. Now, through the mediation of Ambassador Shigemitsu and the assistance of the Japanese government, they have been abolished one by one, allowing our country to develop independently. This is truly a great achievement of Ambassador Shigemitsu. It is not only one of the most glorious pages in the history of China's revival, but also immortal in the history of Sino-Japanese relations. Our government is deeply grateful, and the people of our country will never forget this time that the ambassador has been honored as Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is deeply believed that in the future, he will be able to give full play to his great aspirations and thoroughly implement his proposals based on his understanding during his tenure in China, which will not only benefit the friendly relations between China and Japan, but also be fortunate for the future of East Asia.</p>

<p>Xinjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government's implementation of a partial cabinet reorganization this time has further strengthened its determination to complete the Greater East Asia War. The government and the people of Manchukuo have expressed their full cooperation, decided to implement the established national policy, actively protect the northern border, and strengthen economic cooperation with Japan. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Yamasaki, and Minister of State Omaso are all recognized as celebrities in the Japanese political circles and have outstanding insights. Shigemitsu and Amano have served in the diplomatic circles for many years and are well aware of the situation in Europe and the United States. At this stage when the Greater East Asia War is advancing to the decisive battle, their contributions to Japan's construction in the future will be great. Moreover, the Japanese government's reorganization of the cabinet this time has made the domestic total force more concentrated, and the determination to complete the Greater East Asia War has been strengthened with new determination. Manchukuo has decided to implement the national policy since its founding, defend the northern border with the spirit of one heart and one mind, and actively cooperate with Japan to enhance its combat power. In the economic aspect, it will establish a domestic self-sufficiency system. In the future, it will concentrate the national total force to adapt to the enhancement of the Japanese cabinet and the completion of the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<p>Hanoi, 21st (Central News Agency) - Various parties here are extremely concerned about the partial reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet, believing that Japan's political and war posture will become stronger in the future.

<p>Saigon, 21st (Central News Agency) - Political figures here believe that the strengthening of the Tojo Cabinet is a further success of the Japanese domestic wartime system: Prime Minister Tojo's concurrent post as Minister of Education and State Minister Ando's transfer to the Cabinet are particularly significant: and Ambassador Shigemitsu's promotion to Foreign Minister and Mr. Amano's appointment as Director-General of the Information Bureau are a landmark progress in the cooperation between China and Japan and the ideological war lineup of Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Talk by Mr. Ishiwatari Sotaro, the Highest Economic Advisor of the National Government, Deeply Hoping that All Parties Will Assist the National Government in Thoroughly Investigating Hoarding, and Concrete Policies for Handling Idle Capital Will Be Decided Soon <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - After the National Government participated in the war, all economic construction was actively promoted in accordance with the wartime system. The recent thorough investigation of hoarding and speculation has further demonstrated the determination of the government authorities to stabilize the people's livelihood and revive the economy. The reporter recently visited Mr. Ishiwatari Sotaro, the highest economic advisor of the National Government, and asked him about various issues related to the wartime economy. He answered in detail, and the following is a record:</p>
<p>(Question) What is your opinion on investigating hoarding and speculation?</p>
<p>(Answer) Although hoarding materials is an abnormal phenomenon that is difficult to avoid during wartime, this behavior is extremely harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the National Government authorities' resolute order to thoroughly investigate hoarding and speculation this time is of great significance. I greatly admire the National Government's measures and hope that the thorough investigation will continue to achieve practical results. It is hoped that all parties will provide comprehensive assistance in order to eliminate this abnormal phenomenon and stabilize the people's livelihood. On the other hand, suppressing prices, increasing production, saving consumption, and adjusting allocation are also urgent tasks at present. Therefore, trade associations and general merchants should have a conscious spirit. They must know that taking advantage seems profitable on the surface, but in fact, the ultimate victim is still themselves. In addition, the suppression of prices and the stabilization of currency are inseparable. Banks have now stopped lending to avoid inflation. The National Government is also paying great attention to this matter. The Chinese people must also do their best to assist. Japan will certainly assist at all costs. Since China's participation in the war, China and Japan have entered a stage of coexistence and death. Japan is willing to assist China in completing wartime economic construction.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the policies for increasing production after China's participation in the war?</p>
<p>(Answer) During the war, increasing the production of necessary materials is a matter of urgency. Both China and Japan have a complete plan, and some of it has already been implemented. Factories that were previously invested and operated by British and American companies in Shanghai were closed down due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Now they have been transferred to China by Japan. Therefore, China should use idle capital to engage in operation. It is appropriate to focus on agriculture, such as seed improvement, pest control, and fertilizer improvement, so that agricultural products will increase first. Especially the Central China area has excellent natural conditions and is most suitable for agricultural production. If it can get appropriate guidance, it will have a good harvest. Then, if the agricultural products in the interior and the industrial products in Shanghai are exchanged with each other, or exchanged with the coal in North China, and the surplus is used to make up for the deficiency, it will be of great benefit to economic construction.</p>
<p>(Question) How can Shanghai's idle capital be channeled into increasing production?</p>
<p>(Answer) The use of idle capital is currently a very serious problem. In recent years, idle capital has concentrated in Shanghai. The National Government has paid attention to it early and is actively planning. Concrete policies will be decided soon, and Japan is also preparing to assist. Although the specific methods are not yet known, the general idea is to start with agriculture first, such as reclaiming wasteland and expanding farmland, and other necessary tasks. In addition, if idle capital can be used to operate the enemy property transferred by Japan, the good harvest can also be predicted.</p>
<p>(Question) After the suspension of new military ticket issuance, are there any new policies to enhance the credit of the Central Reserve Bank Notes?</p>
<p>(Answer) The credit issue of the Central Reserve Bank Notes is most related to price increases. Price increases easily lead to a decrease in the value of currency, which is inevitable. Since the issuance of the Central Reserve Bank Notes, not only has there never been any adverse phenomenon, but the foundation has become stronger and the credit has become more prominent. However, the recent price increases have been quite severe, and it is necessary to thoroughly study its causes and try to suppress them.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the specific methods for the exchange of materials between the North and the South?</p>
<p>(Answer) The method of exchanging materials between the North and the South is very simple. At present, the North lacks grain, and the South can transport flour to the North to provide assistance. At the same time, the North produces the most coal, and the price is still very low. The South lacks fuel, so in the future, the North and the South must communicate with each other, and the surplus can be used to make up for the deficiency. In this way, the materials of both parties can be integrated, and there is no need to worry about panic.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo, Speaker of the Legislative Yuan and concurrently Mayor of Shanghai, was recently appointed as a special envoy to visit friendly nation Japan and has now completed his mission and returned to the capital. At 3:00 PM on the 21st, he met with a group of Chinese and foreign reporters in the conference room of the Legislative Yuan and gave the following speech regarding his trip to Japan after returning to the capital: "I am deeply grateful for the cordial hospitality extended by the Japanese government and public during my recent mission to Japan. Although my time in Tokyo was short, I am gratified to have completed my mission. As for my impressions of Tokyo, I would like to share them with you. (1) Three years ago, I was sent to Japan to return a courtesy visit as an envoy of peace. This time, I came to Tokyo again as an envoy of cooperation. I recall that three years ago, I was jointly hosted by Japanese groups and media promoting Pan-Asianism. I said that I hoped Japan would continuously and automatically improve already established relationships, and that China would also continuously and automatically improve future relationships; this is true peace." This time, China voluntarily participated in the Greater East Asia War, and Japan also voluntarily assisted China in achieving its freedom and independence. Therefore, during this trip to Japan, both the Japanese government and public had the feeling that the common ideals had been realized. Their joy is beyond words. (2) The Japanese government and public are very tense during the war. Government authorities are extremely diligent, without a moment's rest. The people everywhere can demonstrate their determination to win and their joint efforts to endure hardship. Regarding rationed materials, the people can automatically conserve and supply them to the front lines. Their spirit of unity from top to bottom and close national solidarity are something our country should emulate. (3) Japan's policy towards China is not only clear, but also its expectations are particularly strong. The government and public all cite Chairman Wang Jingwei's words of sharing weal and woe and living and dying together to express their sincere affection for China. Therefore, regarding my view of the future of China and Japan, the relationship between the two countries is no longer just that of close friends, but has advanced to that of brothers. However, our country should also deeply reflect on the fact that Japan's actions towards us are the result of a long-term ideal and cultural exchange in a long history. We should treat Japan as Japan treats us, and even more so, treat Japan as we treat ourselves. Be careful not to be arrogant, be careful not to be conceited, and strive to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. We must work hard to reform politics, increase production, and further improve relations between China and Japan. The above three points are my impressions after a brief observation. We must know that the relationship between China and Japan is by no means just peace, nor is it just the Greater East Asia War of today, but lies in the similarity of ideals, the similarity of goals, and the similarity of efforts, to jointly shoulder the great responsibilities of the Greater East Asia today and tomorrow. According to my observation, after the completion of this Greater East Asia War, East Asia will probably be in a state of defense for the next twenty years. This is something that the people of China and Japan should deeply reflect upon. As for my trip to Beiping on the way, there was no other mission. Since returning to the capital, I have not visited Beiping for one or two years. The last time was in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933) when I went to Tianjin to preside over the National Mineral Exhibition and visited Beiping on the way. Therefore, I decided to make a special detour to visit friends. During my three-day stay in Beiping, I felt that the authorities were working hard on construction without sparing any effort, and the people's support for the central government and their desire for the exchange of materials between the north and the south were very strong. Recently, the food shortage has reached an extreme level, and the central government has taken measures to provide relief. In the future, North China will focus on increasing production, so there should be no worries."</p>

<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to news from Washington, the US Department of the Army announced yesterday that all US aircraft participating in the air raid on Japan on April 18th last year, except for one that reached the Soviet Union, were destroyed. This confirms the accuracy of the detailed report made yesterday by Major General Tanigaki, spokesman for the Army Information Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. It is said that the US aircraft squadron that carried out the air raid was composed of twin-engine North American bombers, which were carried by the aircraft carrier Hornet to a location less than 800 miles from Tokyo, and then took off. A total of 80 pilots participated in the air raid. The idea of this air raid came one month after the Japanese aircraft bombed Pearl Harbor. At that time, Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle, who was still a colonel, selected pilots from volunteers and then spent three months preparing, completing his training at Eglin Field in Florida. It was stipulated that after bombing the Japanese mainland, the US aircraft should fly to airfields within Chongqing's territory. However, due to environmental conditions, all the aircraft failed to reach the designated airfields. Several aircraft landed in areas occupied by the Japanese army or at sea near the Chinese coast. Doolittle himself took off at 8:20 AM that morning and parachuted into Chinese territory 13 hours later. Five others landed in Soviet territory and have been detained.</p>

<h3 id="e19">British and American Forces Attempt to Launch Another Offensive Around Bizerte, Tunisia; Axis Forces Prepared for Retaliation, Fearless <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) Last night, a German military spokesman declared that the German-Italian forces in the North African theater are currently occupying the main lines in that area. Military experts here unanimously believe that the divisions under Marshal Rommel and Lieutenant General Arnim are capable of holding their current positions to resist any offensive. Judging from the military actions of the past few days, it can be seen that the offensives of the British First and Eighth Armies are increasing daily, suggesting that the first large-scale offensive by British and American forces in the areas around Tunis and Bizerte is about to begin. The transfer of Rommel's forces has given General Montgomery of the British Eighth Army ample time to make all necessary preparations for a major offensive, so the Axis defenders are also prepared and fearless. Furthermore, according to a German announcement, the number of British and American tanks destroyed in North Africa since the Battle of El Alamein has reached over 4,000, not just the 400 claimed by the British.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) The final battle in Tunisia began last night in Enfidaville. The British Eighth Army launched a major offensive against the German-Italian forces in the trapezoidal positions in the mountains. However, the strong defenders won the first battle, routing the wave of British troops and forcing them to retreat to their original positions.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to news from the front lines in North Africa, the Tunisian front has become increasingly active in recent days, and the time for a decisive battle seems to be approaching. The British Eighth Army has been deploying in the area south of Enfidaville for days. On the 19th, it finally launched a full-scale attack with strong infantry units, engaging in a decisive battle with Rommel's forces. The anti-Axis forces suffered heavy damage due to the concentrated artillery positions of the Axis forces, but continued to reinforce and attack fiercely. Some even reached the Axis positions, but by the morning of the 20th, they had been surrounded and annihilated by the Axis forces. The Enfidaville line of defense is currently still in the hands of the Axis forces. It is currently unclear whether this attack by the British Eighth Army is the beginning of the decisive battle on the Tunisian front. It is also reported that the Axis forces launched a counterattack on Bou Arada in the western region on the 19th. The French rebel forces near El Agareb in the south have now increased pressure on the anti-Axis forces in that area.</p>
<p>Rome, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) Authoritative sources have authorized the Stefani Agency to announce that since the Axis forces withdrew from the Wadi Akarit line to the current Enfidaville line, they have been able to consolidate and hold firmly. The realization of this unity of the troops is due to the fighting spirit and skills of the Axis forces. During the withdrawal, the British and American forces attempted to attack the flanks of the German-Italian forces. The Axis forces fought continuously to delay the enemy's actions. On the morning of April 6th, after a fierce air and artillery preparation, the enemy attacked the Spezia and Pistoia divisions, cutting off Jebel Roumana and other positions. Afterwards, they launched a fierce attack on the Trieste division, breaking into the Italian lines. To avoid being surrounded, the Italian army launched a counterattack, resulting in the recovery of Jebel Roumana. As a result, the enemy's attack along the entire front was delayed. The Axis forces were under pressure from the enemy on the west, southwest, and south sides, so they decided to retreat. Because they did not want to over exhaust the troops, they decided not to make continuous defenses with hasty preparations, but to retreat according to plan to the line prepared at Enfidaville. In order to complete this long retreat, it was necessary to fight the enemy along the line from El Guettar to Akarit, avoiding being surrounded in the Maknassy area. Finally, the enemy, who attempted to advance between Pichon and Fondouk and attack Kairouan, was defeated. Since the British and American forces joined forces, the pressure exerted by the enemy from the southwest and south sides became even more dangerous. The British Eighth Army, after joining forces, was greatly facilitated and could obtain supplies from its base in Algeria. On April 7th, the battle resumed, this time extending to the northern region. At the same time, the First Army also completed its withdrawal. After the enemy contacted our rearguard, they were quite successful. On April 9th, the Axis forces completed their withdrawal, and fierce battles also occurred at Fondouk and Pichon. The enemy advanced near Fondouk, forcing the Axis forces to decide to retreat to Enfidaville. The enemy in the north also attacked Medjez el Bab again, hoping to pass between Maktar and Tunis. Although they had some local victories, they were ultimately blocked by the German army. After the Axis forces retreated to the new positions, on April 16th, they defeated the enemy who came to attack. A major battle has now begun along this new line of positions. According to the enemy's own admission, this battle will be an extremely difficult and bloody battle.</p>
<h3 id="e20">British Artillery Intensifies Bombardment, Probing the Strength of the Axis Forces <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to a military correspondent from the Havas News Agency, there is currently fierce fighting in the southern section of the Tunisian bridgehead, and this fighting has clearly gone beyond the scope of local battles. On Monday, many British artillery units began to explore the range of the German-Italian positions. By Monday evening, the British artillery intensified its bombardment. On Tuesday morning, British forces attacked again with strong infantry and tank units, but encountered strong resistance. The fighting quickly expanded and was still raging at noon on Tuesday. It is currently difficult to say whether this battle marks the beginning of the British Eighth Army's expected large-scale new offensive, or whether it is merely an attempt at armed reconnaissance. General Montgomery's strategy is to launch an initial attack, and then decide whether to immediately continue the attack with a large number of troops or temporarily stop the fighting, depending on its success or failure. In the current stage of the battle, Montgomery is very likely to use this type of strategy. The fighting in the western section of Tunisia also seems to be more active. On Monday, the British First Army launched several small-scale attacks on the German positions on the high ground, but was repelled. Anti-Axis sources say that General Anderson is advancing towards Djebel Djobba, while also claiming that he is fighting German mountain troops in the mountains northwest of Medjez el Bab, which is contradictory. It is unreasonable or imprudent for the British army to advance towards Djebel Djobba while the German army is still present on these mountains on the German flank. British generals are unlikely to do this. It is worth noting that the US army has sent one or two divisions to join the British Eighth Army, and now more troops are joining the British First Army. The US Fifth Army currently does not seem to be operating as an independent unit.</p>

<p>Geneva, 20th (Central News Agency Dispatch) A German news agency reports that news from Washington today indicates that the statements made by Major General Kenryo Sato of the Japanese Army Ministry that Japan is now capable of attacking the US mainland have caused great panic in the United States. Major General Sato stated that the average American has not yet realized that the so-called US technological superiority has become a thing of the past. This coincides with the warnings issued by General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis forces, and Australian Prime Minister Curtin that Australia is under direct threat of Japanese attack. Well-informed sources in Washington solemnly declare that, as far as the situation in the Pacific is concerned, its development is decidedly favorable to Japan, but the American public seems to be too inattentive to it. The powerful Japanese air strikes have prompted the Australian Prime Minister to re-issue warnings against misplaced optimism. According to recent Australian news, the greatest danger currently facing US forces in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea is that their fighting power can only be maintained if supplies are continuous. The anti-Axis high command no longer denies Japanese air superiority in the South Pacific because US Navy transport ships are often bombed by Japanese aircraft.</p>

According to dispatches from New Delhi, the Indian anti-Axis military headquarters announced on the 20th that the central army in Arakan has been forced to retreat to new positions and is now retreating towards the Indian border in two columns. Japanese forces now control the Mayu River, so the retreat route for British naval vessels on the river to the estuary has been cut off.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st - Central News Agency - The anti-Axis Indian expeditionary force in Burma is gradually retreating towards the Indian border due to fierce attacks by Japanese forces.

<h3 id="e38">Detailed Account of Sinking of U.S. Aircraft Carrier: A Glorious Page in the Record of Japanese Submarines <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(From Hirate Naval Reporting Team, 〇〇 Base) - It is recalled that on June 7th of last year, the Japanese 〇〇 submarine sank the U.S. Yorktown large aircraft carrier far in the northern waters of Midway Island, establishing an immortal feat and receiving the first commendation since the start of the war. The following is the submarine captain's handwritten account of the attack on the aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>The I-numbered 〇〇 submarine participated in the Battle of Midway Island. From the beginning of June last year, it was tasked with monitoring the area around the island and shelling enemy air bases. On the evening of the 6th, it received orders to sink the enemy Yorktown-class aircraft carrier, which had been damaged by our naval air forces and was drifting north of Midway Island. It immediately sailed at full speed to the designated location. At dawn on the 7th, the ship was discovered in the distant ocean, being towed slowly by several escorting destroyers. The Yorktown-class was surrounded by several escorting destroyers, with extremely tight security. In addition, the weather was clear, and the sea was calm, making it quite difficult to approach at close range. Our submarine strictly controlled its acoustics and, with bold and careful maneuvers, passed under the hulls of the guarding destroyers three times. Finally, according to the planned maneuver, it approached the shortest distance and launched accurate torpedoes, skillfully sinking the enemy aircraft carrier. The time was 10:30 AM. However, after launching the torpedoes, the enemy destroyers immediately launched a fierce attack, lasting four hours. Even after our ship surfaced, it was still subjected to chasing shelling. Due to calm and alert evasive maneuvers, it finally escaped the crisis, and the mission was successfully completed.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of the Midway Island operation, our ship searched for enemy ships in the nearby area. On June 6th, an aircraft carrier damaged by our air force's surprise attack was drifting with a list near 〇〇 nautical miles north of Midway Island. Our ship received orders to sink it and arrived at the designated location before dawn the next day. At 〇〇:00 AM on the 7th, upon arriving at the designated location, the lookout reported "Black spots sighted." This was the initial sighting, followed by the sighting of another black spot. At this time, the aircraft carrier was sailing in the 〇〇 degree direction. Our ship submerged 〇〇 meters behind it. The line of sight gradually became clearer, and it was identified that the aircraft carrier was listing to the left. It was decided to attack from the left and proceed to the appropriate attack distance.</p>
<p>There were no traces of bombing craters on the flight deck, nor did it appear that a fire had occurred. I thought perhaps it had been attacked by torpedoes and was listing. I immediately ordered anti-depth charge defenses and completed preparations inside the ship, such as arranging the lights. There were five enemy destroyers surrounding us, two in front, with extremely tight security. The sky was clear, with only a 5-meter per second east wind, and the waves were flat, making for excellent attack weather. When sighted, the enemy ship was stopped in its drifting mode. After repeated surfacing observations, it was found that it was different from what had been expected in the navigation officer's plotting. About 〇 hours and a half had passed since we began to submerge. Had there been no action yet? I began to feel doubtful.</p>
<p>Each time the lateral distance observed by periscope was unexpectedly gradually approaching, but the bearing angle was increasing. Thus, it was felt that an attack from the left would be difficult. We did not know if the enemy had the ability to maneuver. We tentatively judged that it was maneuvering and decided to attack from the right. During the two hours of crossing the enemy's screen, the periscope was not used at all. We only used the plotting to break through in the direction of cutting off the enemy's route of advance. Regardless of whether we had been discovered by the enemy, we silently submerged, leaving it up to fate. The enemy destroyers had almost passed over our ship's head several times.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Shadow in the Periscope</p>
<p>At 〇〇:00, the periscope showed the enemy aircraft carrier being towed by two destroyers, at around 〇〇 meters. Initially, we wanted to wait for the enemy at a firing point at a bearing angle of 〇〇 degrees and a distance of 〇〇 meters. At this time, our ship had already broken through the enemy destroyer screen and was at the closest distance. Soon, before the aircraft carrier reached the position where our ship was waiting, I immediately ordered "Fire!" Ah! Four times! The sound of powerful hits shook our ship. Large explosions occurred one after another, creating waves and noise that were deafening.</p>
<p>Before the launch, the enemy destroyer was only 〇〇 meters from our ship's stern. After the enemy was hit by the torpedoes, it fled in confusion over our ship, scrambling in panic. An hour later, an enemy destroyer passed over our ship from right to left and dropped depth charges twice. After that, more than a hundred depth charges were dropped every ten to fifteen minutes. However, only 〇〇 parts of our ship were damaged. We continued to take emergency measures. I inspected each part of the ship three times. The crew's desperate efforts to survive were truly divine. I could not help but clasp my hands in prayer in my heart.</p>
<p>By 〇〇:00, the battery power was exhausted, the electric motors stopped, and the air became cloudy. The inside of the ship gradually darkened, with only the hand lamps still providing a few points of light, like a sign of our connected lives.</p>
<p>Escaping the Enemy's Encirclement</p>
<p>Our ship then began to surface at an angle of 〇〇 degrees. The chief mechanic came to the issuing station and, following the instructions of the former officer, ordered the engineers to move back and forth to maintain balance, because there was no other way to survive except to surface. If we could surface, then the only option would be to aim for the enemy's vital point and carry out a suicide attack. However, we still held onto a glimmer of hope. 〇〇 minutes had already passed since the last bombing. Perhaps the enemy ships were already far away. In anxiety, we opened the bridge hatch, climbed onto the bridge, and looked around. There were no enemies nearby, nor were there any aircraft. Only in the distance, near 〇〇, could we see three destroyers heading home. The aircraft carrier was no longer in sight. It could probably be confirmed that it had been sunk. With the sinking of the aircraft carrier, our mission was over. Let us die at any time! We have done our human duty and await fate. As we thought the enemy destroyers were still within range and had not yet fully submerged, the enemy had also discovered our ship and began to turn back.</p>
<p>Before surfacing, it was reported: "Silence is absent, air pressure is 〇〇 kilograms." So we quickly ordered charging and ventilation, turned the stern of the ship toward the enemy, and fled at full speed. Our ship emitted thick black smoke, which covered us from both sides, enveloping the ship in smoke. Among the three destroyers, the middle one had no hope of catching up. Only the left and right ones. The destroyer on the left was obscured by our smokescreen. Only the one on the right was occasionally visible in the sparse smokescreen. At 〇〇 minutes, the enemy increased its speed, and the distance was gradually decreasing. The lookout reported "Getting closer!" The situation inside the ship, according to the Marine Chief's report, we could not go much further.</p>
<p>Reporting Mission Accomplished</p>
<p>This submersion would be the end of life, I had long held such a realization. So I verbally ordered the communications chief to issue a mission completion report, saying "The mission to sink the aircraft carrier has been completed." At the same time, I made a signal and quickly sent a notification by telegram. Suddenly, a destroyer that had communicated with us 〇〇 minutes before submerging approached 〇〇 meters. However, a small submersion still could not escape. I asked the electrical engineer, "How is the electricity?" He replied, "No confidence." With the expectation of dying in battle, I did not want to see my lovely subordinates perish with me. A final effort! One more struggle, using the electrical power in the ship as a standard, we submerged again.</p>
<p>In depth 〇〇, a voice came from the speaking tube, saying, "The propeller is slowly turning." Was this not a dream? I asked myself. Listen! Listen! We had finally won. Where there is a will, there is a way. Perseverance is the true submarine spirit. The enemy's artillery fire began to explode behind us. Because our ship was submerging in the smokescreen, the enemy shells could not hit us. The sky gradually darkened. The enemy ship, having lost its nerve before our surprise attack, only launched a few intimidating depth charges this time, passing over our heads. At 〇〇:00, our ship, shining with the shadow of victory, reappeared in the dark sea of twilight. (Sho: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, April 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e39">Preparations for the German-Soviet Summer Offensive <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Both Germany and the Soviet Union believe that the Soviet Union's winter offensive has come to an end, and the new offensives of the German and Soviet armies will soon follow. On the 4th of this month, German General Dittmar stated: "The largest of all military experiments is currently being prepared." This is of course not limited to the Eastern Front. However, Dittmar regarded the Eastern Front as the most visible of the five decisive fronts. These five fronts are: (1) The Western Front; (2) The Atlantic Front; (3) The Greater East Asia Front; (4) The Northwest African Front; (5) The Air Front over Germany and Occupied Countries.</p>
<p>Currently, both Germany and the Soviet Union are waiting for the opportunity to begin a large-scale conflict on the Eastern Front, at the latest this summer. A German newspaper published the following dispatch from Berlin under the headline "A Prelude to Expanded Military Operations on the Eastern Front":</p>
<p>"The arrival of spring this year has come particularly early on the Eastern Front, which has not only ended the Soviet offensive. The rapid pace of seasonal transition has meant that the ground in the southern district, namely the Kupiansk region, is already drying out, so it seems the Soviet Union will launch an offensive in that area. But the fighting will be limited to local battles."</p>
<p>The report went on to say: "Apart from the Kupiansk area, the ground in the entire Donets Basin has dried out and is suitable for a large-scale offensive." In this regard, we quote from Lieutenant General Dittmar's article "Winter Offensive" as follows:</p>
<p>"We admit that the Soviet Union has achieved some success in this offensive. However, in addition to the weapons production competition, Germany has discovered new methods and means that will surprise the enemy. The large Soviet army on the front will be at a loss. The Soviet winter offensive is now a thing of the past, and we have already understood that the Soviet forces are not inexhaustible. The vast Soviet territory, the Russian winter, and the huge human resources are the three key factors in Soviet success. This winter, the vast Soviet territory has given the Red Army many advantages on the Eastern Front. But this winter, the blows suffered by both the German and Soviet armies in terms of human resources are one of the most unfathomable elements of the factors that determine the war situation. However, the outdated Soviet operational plan, like that of Napoleon in 1812, has failed. Because this operational plan is only effective when dealing with enemies without elasticity and decisiveness. However, elasticity is the core of German military tactics. Therefore, the German army has felt from the results of the German-Soviet war that special rules must be used to fight against the Soviet army. And now we already know what this law is and how to use it?"</p>
<p>Two articles published in Pravda on local news are related to this and are extremely noteworthy. First, it points out that if the climate and ground conditions are good, the German army may launch a new offensive at any time. Several dozens of German elite divisions are now entering the front line in the Donets Basin. German factory workers are being mobilized to form new units. The German army occupies locations suitable for launching a new offensive, especially the Donets Basin, which can be used as a base for launching offensives against the northern Don River region and the southern Caucasus. Fierce fighting will soon begin. Second, the Soviet Union will also launch an offensive this summer. This comes from a senior member of the Red Army General Staff, and its main points are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>"This year's summer offensive can liberate the Soviet Union from the German army. The Soviet Union will make the most advantageous use of its mechanized divisions. We did not make good use of the results of this winter offensive, because snow and mud hindered the Red Army's offensive. Winter is called the offensive season for the Soviet army. This does not mean that the Soviet army likes winter, but rather that preparations are usually completed by winter. But this year, the Soviet army seems to have completed all preparations for military operations in a very short period of time. We do not ignore the German army's military strength. The German army is an extremely tenacious enemy, and everyone knows that the German army is now accelerating preparations for the Soviet summer offensive. But we know the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet Union. The reason why the German army can achieve great results is that its excellent mechanized units concentrate their forces in one location and carry out concentrated, large-scale attacks. Conversely, the Soviet Union cannot quickly move troops to the German army's concentration points for defense. The Soviet army's mechanization has not yet been completed, but mechanization is being implemented quickly and effectively."</p>
<p>This report explains why the Soviet army has repeatedly re-enacted the winter offensive every year. This contradicts the experts of neutral countries. The implication is that the Soviet army may launch a summer offensive starting this summer. (Zurich, Taguchi Correspondent, 8th - Sho: Translated from the Western Asahi Newspaper, April 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e41">Recent Situation in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River, Revealed by the Japanese Military Authorities in Shanghai <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) According to news revealed by the Japanese military authorities here, the recent situation in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Since the beginning of this month, the New Fourth Army, numbering 2,000 men, which infiltrated the area east of Shijiu Lake, has been in contact with the Chongqing regular army and miscellaneous troops entrenched in that area and the area south of Lishui. The New Fourth Army suffered fierce attacks. Small units were surrounded in various places and suffered heavy blows, fleeing to the Shijiu Lake area. The Chongqing army is still gathering forces and will continue to pursue them. There are signs that the conflict between Chongqing and the Communists in that area is becoming increasingly serious.</p>
<p>(2) Since the 11th of this month, Japanese troops in the Jiangbei area have repeatedly conducted mopping-up operations against the Chongqing army's Li Mingyang troops in the area between Taixian, Xinghua, and Dongtai. On the 13th, near Fengjiazhuang, 25 kilometers northeast of Taixian, they surrounded and annihilated 3,000 men of Zhang Xingbing's unit, and also routed part of Li Mingyang's troops. They are still continuing to thoroughly mop up the fleeing remnants of the Chongqing army. To date, Chongqing army battalion commanders and regimental commanders have been captured by the Japanese army. Also, on the 16th, the commander of the 1st Column of Li Mingyang's army and his group participated in the "Peace Movement".

<p>The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, after implementing sugar distribution based on population, has already begun preparations for the third phase of sugar distribution based on sugar ration cards. It is said that the mountain region has submitted a request to the military allocation authorities for the sugar allocation quota for April. Once approved, the allocation will be carried out immediately. (1) Type A retailers are exclusively for household sugar consumption. (2) Type B retailers supply special allocations for various industries' operational needs. It is reported that the sugar needed by various industries will be subject to an application system, with the application period set from the 23rd to the 25th of each month. After review and approval, a sugar purchase certificate will be issued, and the certificate holder will pay the designated Type B retailer for the goods. It is stipulated that specially allocated sugar is only for self-use and not for resale, and violators will be dealt with according to the law. As for the first phase of household sugar, it will expire on April 30th. Expired cards will be invalid. Cardholders are requested to purchase from designated Type A retailers before the deadline.</p>
<p>In other news, the second phase of sugar distribution based on population began in different areas on the 15th of this month. However, the Public Works Department requires all Type A retail stores involved in this sugar distribution to report their sugar sales. For every hundred sugar purchase certificates, a report form must be filled out, and the purchase certificates must be attached to the form and submitted to the Bureau for verification. The first phase has already been completed, and the same procedure must be followed for this phase. The report forms needed by Type A sugar stores are sold by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative and can be purchased there.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Reader's Forum Establishing Joint Guarantee Primary Schools <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Kaiwen</p>
<p>Education is the foundation of a nation, especially primary school education, which lays the groundwork for citizens' knowledge and morals. It should be actively promoted to enhance the nation's vitality.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, our country's education has been at a standstill due to the impact of the war. Since the start of peace and the return of the National Government to the capital, although the government authorities have made every effort to promote it, it has gradually recovered, but it has not yet seen universal development. Just looking at the current situation of primary school education in this city, on the surface, schools are numerous and primary school education is very developed. However, the situation of schools in this city is different from that in other parts of the interior. Most of the primary schools in Shanghai, except for a few public primary schools and those established by a few public organizations, are all privately established. Regular expenses rely on tuition income to maintain. In recent years, the cost of living has risen daily, and the tuition fees of various schools have gradually increased as a result. As far as the author knows, the tuition fees for primary schools in the two concession areas are as high as 150 yuan and as low as 80 yuan. General middle and lower-class families, under this high cost of living pressure, can barely afford three meals a day, let alone have the extra money to provide for their children's education expenses. As a result, the number of school-age children excluded from schools is increasing day by day. If we conduct an accurate survey and statistics, the number of out-of-school children in this city must be very alarming.</p>
<p>Although there is no shortage of enthusiastic people in society who are doing their best to help out-of-school children, such as the establishment of scholarships by Shen Xin and other newspapers and various organizations, and the establishment of free schools, the resources are limited and the number of people is limited. It is impossible to help all the out-of-school children in the city. Judging from the above situation, the seriousness of the current problem of primary school education in Shanghai should also be addressed in the same way as the issue of prices.</p>
<p>The Baojia system is not only a mechanism for preventing undesirable elements and ensuring local security, but also a mechanism for promoting local public welfare undertakings. Since the city implemented the Baojia system, bandits have disappeared and the local area has been peaceful. It is therefore necessary to further promote public welfare undertakings. Education is the priority of public welfare, and the establishment of joint guarantee primary schools in this city is currently an urgent task.</p>
<p>We hope that those enthusiastic about Baojia work in Shanghai will, in the spirit of serving the local area and cultivating talents for the country, realize the establishment of joint guarantee primary schools in the short term. This is what all the citizens are eagerly looking forward to.</p>
<p>Now, based on my humble opinion, I will briefly list a few methods for establishing joint guarantee primary schools below:</p>
<p>(1) Administrative Organization: Organize a joint guarantee education committee, with the joint guarantee chief and the chiefs of each Bao and enthusiastic educators in the area as joint guarantee education committee members, to handle educational administrative matters.</p>
<p>(2) Number of Schools: Investigate the number of out-of-school children in the Bao and determine the number of schools to be established.</p>
<p>(3) Fees: No tuition or miscellaneous fees will be charged, and books will be provided as much as possible.</p>
<p>(4) Sources of Funding:</p>
<p>Start-up Costs: Solicit donations from shops and wealthy residents in the Bao.</p>
<p>Recurring Expenses: Organize Baojia education monthly donations, with different levels of donations set.</p>
<p>Determine the amount of donation for each household, which will be collected monthly by the Jia chief from the residents.</p>
<p>Request the Baojia authorities to provide appropriate subsidies.</p>
<p>(5) In order to save expenses, all staff members, except for teachers and school workers, should volunteer their services.</p>
<p>The above points are only general outlines. As for the detailed methods, they need to be carefully planned by the Baojia gentlemen to make them perfect.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Japanese Authorities Treat Enemy Nationals in Shanghai with Generosity in Group Living Implementing Assembly Gradually Since the End of January Aiming to Prevent Espionage, Especially the Instigation of the Fifth Column <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese military authorities here have treated the enemy nationals residing in the Shanghai area with great leniency. Initially, their lives were hardly restricted in any way, and they were able to live freely. However, due to the prolongation of the war, the following reasons have been given: (1) To prevent espionage, especially the instigation of the Fifth Column. (2) To stabilize the lives of enemy nationals, it was decided to order enemy nationals residing in the Shanghai area to live collectively. This has been gradually implemented since January 31st of this year, and the organization of collective living has generally been completed recently. Thousands of British, American, Dutch, Belgian, and other enemy nationals residing in the Shanghai area are currently divided into several locations, scattered around Shanghai, enjoying a privileged life with their wives and families in a good environment. The Japanese government bears their living expenses with an extremely fair and generous attitude and provides as much convenience as possible to stabilize their lives. Attention has been paid to the structure of the shelters, the surrounding environment, and the internal facilities. Special care has been taken with the diet, and medical and entertainment facilities have also been made as complete as possible. Communication is also permitted, and books, newspapers, magazines, and wireless radios are available. Residents in the shelters organize various committees themselves to rationalize their lives. There are classrooms for educating children and sports grounds and walking areas for maintaining health. Other equipment such as tennis and volleyball are also complete. They all live in harmony and pass a happy life, and they automatically cultivate vegetables using the open space in the shelter. The Japanese government's generous and fair measures have led to the fact that the enemy nationals are now enjoying complete protection compared to before, and their lives are guaranteed. Those who have been accommodated have expressed their gratitude for the authorities' attitude. The Japanese authorities here specifically issued a statement yesterday (the 21st) regarding the collective living of enemy nationals:</p>
<p>Statement: "The Imperial Japanese authorities in Shanghai, in order to prevent espionage, especially the instigation of the Fifth Column, and to enable enemy nationals to live a stable life, have decided to order enemy nationals residing in the Shanghai area to live collectively. This has been gradually implemented since January 31st and has generally been completed. They and their families are all living happily in a pleasant environment, and their health is very good."</p>

<h3 id="e48">Anti-Epidemic Vaccination Certificates Must Not Be Borrowed or Forged Certificates Issued by Private Doctors Must Be Officially Exchanged at the Health Department <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The health authorities of the two concession areas have already started full-scale anti-epidemic vaccinations. In addition to designated places and times for free vaccinations for citizens, mobile vaccination teams have also been organized to go to various important roads, schools, and factories for vaccinations for public groups. All citizens who have been vaccinated against epidemics will be given a certificate called "Typhus Prevention Vaccination Certificate," which is valid for four months and states the date of vaccination, age, gender, name, or right thumbprint. The health authorities have now issued an order that anti-epidemic certificates must not be borrowed from others or forged. The vaccinated person must use the anti-epidemic certificate issued by a private doctor to exchange it for a fixed certificate at the health department. If a doctor issues a certificate without actually vaccinating, he will be investigated if discovered.</p>
<p>Verification of Certificates The anti-epidemic vaccination campaign in various districts of this city has been expanded one after another to maintain public health in the summer. The Public Concession Health Department has also expanded publicity, hanging banners with slogans all over the bridges and roads to attract public attention. In the urban area, anti-epidemic certificates have been checked at the iron gates of Nanyang Bridge and other places bordering the French Concession since yesterday (the 21st). Those without certificates are vaccinated on the spot. The anti-epidemic vaccination team organized by the Municipal Health Bureau is responsible for this vaccination work.</p>
<p>Anti-Epidemic Picture Slides The Shanghai Chinese Film Association, in order to assist the authorities in launching the anti-epidemic campaign, specially hung up picture slides of the newly compiled anti-epidemic script "Invisible Little Devils" in the shop windows of major companies and stores in the city yesterday, imparting anti-epidemic knowledge so that citizens understand the importance of anti-epidemic and automatically request anti-epidemic vaccinations.</p>
<p>Anti-Epidemic in West Shanghai The West Shanghai Anti-Epidemic Task Force established an anti-epidemic vaccination team on the 16th of this month and set off to carry out vaccinations in the shantytowns in the district. Starting from the 20th, it launched a full-scale preventive vaccination campaign at eight key points in the district. Citizens in the district who were vaccinated were very enthusiastic, and the statistics to date are more than 40,000 people. Mr. Chen Yeqin, director of the West Shanghai Health Office and the chief captain of the task force, also inspected the eight locations in the district yesterday and encouraged the staff.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Ambassador Shigemitsu Transferred to Foreign Minister Strengthening the Significance of the Japanese Cabinet Enhancing the Strength of the War Cabinet to Run and Indicate Directions Concretely Realizing the Diplomatic Policy of the Axis Powers The Minister of Information, Hirota, Answered Questions from the Press Corps at a Reception <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy held a regular meeting with the Chinese press corps in this city at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 21st). Those attending from the embassy included Minister of Information Hirota and Vice Consul Fukuma. More than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended and held a cordial discussion.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Wartime Cabinet First, the press corps asked Minister of Information Hirota about (1) the significance of the Allied strengthening of the wartime cabinet this time, and (2) whether there would be any changes in Japan's future diplomatic policies after Ambassador Shigemitsu took office as Foreign Minister. The replies were as follows: The purpose of Japan's strengthening of the cabinet this time is (1) Since Prime Minister Tojo formed the cabinet in October of the year before last, a year and a half has passed. During this time, the Greater East Asia War broke out. In order to complete the liberation of the Greater East Asian nations, Japan resolutely went to war. In this great era, the government has carefully planned and its responsibilities are heavy, so it is necessary to make partial adjustments to strengthen the wartime cabinet. (2) At the beginning of the formation of the Tojo cabinet, the focus was on the combination of comrades. Now, because the scope is small, it is necessary to enhance the strength of the war cabinet this time and devote efforts to running and indicating directions. This is the meaning of this decision to strengthen the cabinet. Therefore, after Ambassador Shigemitsu is transferred to Foreign Minister, there will be absolutely no changes in Japan's future diplomacy.</p>
<p>Strengthening Axis Relations The press corps then asked Minister of Information Hirota, after Ambassador Shigemitsu took office as Foreign Minister, about (1) diplomacy with East Asian countries, (2) relations with Axis countries, and (3) adapting to the current world situation. The replies were as follows: The Axis alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy is the foundation of Japan's diplomatic policy. In the future, the relationship between the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy will be further strengthened. The Japanese Foreign Ministry originally focused on handling diplomacy with countries outside Greater East Asia and is also responsible for handling diplomacy with Greater East Asian countries. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the situation in Greater East Asia in order to smoothly operate diplomacy. Not only has Mr. Shigemitsu been in China for a long time, but he also has a clear understanding of the situation in China, so we have high expectations for the new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, who is suitable for the job. Furthermore, in terms of Mr. Shigemitsu's experience, before serving as Ambassador to China, he successively served as Ambassador to the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, as well as an official in the Japanese Foreign Ministry. In addition, he also spent a considerable amount of time in Germany and the United States. Therefore, in addition to understanding the situation in East Asia, he also has an accurate understanding of the situation in various European groups. We firmly believe that the new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, based on his rich experience and adhering to Japan's fundamental diplomatic policy, will be able to more concretely realize the diplomatic policy of the Axis powers to adapt to the current world situation.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Economic Circles: Commentary - "Autonomous Control of Commercial Organizations" <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>During a tea party held the other day by the former Minister of Food, attended by key representatives of the food industry and all directors and supervisors of the National Commercial Control Association, the Commercial Control Association expressed its hope for "autonomous control of commercial organizations." Therefore, we feel that the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, the ongoing adjustments of trade associations, and even the recent active withdrawal of loans by the banking industry, all demonstrate that the arrow of wartime economic policy is indeed gradually moving towards the path of autonomous control. Undoubtedly, this is a ray of dawn for the Chinese economic world during wartime. What we primarily await is the flourishing and expansion of this ray of dawn, ensuring that there is not even a trace of obstruction obscuring it.</p>
<p>We discussed the issue of economic autonomous control in the economic lecture on March 4th, believing that commercial organizations, while engaging in lofty discussions of autonomous control, should absolutely not take obtaining and maintaining their own common welfare as their premise, but should instead take adapting to the surrounding environment and promoting the common welfare of society as their sole and unique mission. In addition, the two basic conditions for autonomous control are: (1) being able to manage themselves, and (2) being able to self-report. The first is the inherent ability of people's organizations to develop, and the second is the strength of social sanctions to be tested.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that if we are not going to talk about autonomous control of commercial organizations, then so be it; otherwise, two strict organizations must be prepared: first, a highly strengthened council, whose responsibility is to standardize and rationalize the prices of goods, and to universalize and equalize the distribution of goods; second, a highly strengthened supervisory committee, whose responsibility is to conduct thorough investigations and open accusations. The candidates for these two committees must undergo the strictest selection; those serving as councilors must have familiarity with commodity conditions and the state of people's livelihoods as their sole condition, and those serving as supervisors must have impartiality, shrewdness, competence, and fearlessness, with nothing to hide, as their sole condition.</p>
<p>Only by practicing autonomous control of commercial organizations in this way can the autonomous control of commercial organizations win the faith of the public.</p>

<p>Since the National Commercial Control Association was established on March 15th, the four departments and fifteen groups of the internal organization's affairs department have been largely completed. The industry associations of various professional departments are being urged by the industry associations to actively prepare organizations in accordance with the orders and regulations of the ministry, in order to serve as the lower-level mechanisms of the association. Therefore, in the future, all important commodity industries must have associations to serve as the cadre institutions for autonomous control of groups. All matters concerning the purchase, allocation, manufacturing, transportation, and sales of materials are under the control of the Commercial Control Association. Therefore, Mei Siping, Minister of Industry, in view of this, specially submitted it to the 158th meeting of the Executive Yuan for approval, and the Special Commodity Transportation and Sales Administration was abolished and merged into the Ministry's Shanghai Office. It is understood that the Special Commodity Transportation and Sales Administration will be closed and merged at the end of this month, and preparations are now underway to handle closing matters.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Translation and Commentary: Hoping for Self-Restraint in the Financial Sector <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The National Government's authorities have been loud in their calls for a thorough investigation into speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, but the results have been insignificant. The parties undertaking the investigation seem to have failed to fully understand the complexity and importance of the issue, and have only acted hastily, resulting in a failure to achieve the intended results. This is something they should take responsibility for. However, although there are few cases of illegal acts, their impact is by no means superficial, especially because of the thorough investigation. The whole picture of speculation and hoarding in Shanghai has been clearly revealed, and the actions of financial institutions have also been fully understood. This provides good data for self-restraint in the Chinese financial sector, and its significance is quite significant.</p>
<p>The banking sector has a significant relationship with speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, which is clear to everyone, but it was not as clearly understood as it is now before the investigation. Large and small banks have released credit loans to make hoarding funds, or have set up shell organizations, using funds to engage in business hoarding themselves. These disorderly behaviors have really exceeded our expectations. Disregarding laws and regulations, only knowing how to profit from speculation, regardless of everything, we can't help but be speechless at the track behavior. Banking capital finding a way out in speculative activities is of course because it has lost its normal way out. However, no matter how it loses its normal way out, it should not have the irregular status quo of today. Banking capital should have the standards and limits of banking capital. Getting out of this standard and limit is of course the bank's suicidal behavior, and it exposes the immorality of the principals.</p>
<p>It is heard that the financial sector has expressed self-restraint and self-respect, not only starting to recover improper loans, but also stopping improper loans in the future, and refraining from hoarding and trading activities themselves. This is something to be congratulated on, especially because it is able to be implemented automatically, which is even more worthy of our attention. The funds recovered after investigating hoarding, it is said, have been taken back by the Banking Association and the Money Shop Association, with the total amount of 100 million yuan, and 50 million yuan has been recovered in other areas. Although this amount is small, the method is good and the intention is beautiful, and it is worthy of welcome. If this kind of self-restraint can go a few steps further, and actively recover general speculative funds, then it will be more effective than investigating, punishing, etc. to prevent speculation. We hope that the National Government authorities will pay attention to promoting this self-restraint movement.</p>
<p>However, there is one more thing that must be considered at the same time, which is the measures after these speculative funds are recovered. Everyone believes that due to this recovery measure, the bank's profit margin will be reduced to a certain extent. If there is no good follow-up measure, it is feared that banks will be induced to fall into depravity again. However, now that the National Commercial Control Association has been established, the circulation of materials has been restored, and the revival of sound production enterprises, etc., then everyone must start working quickly from this point of view.

<h3 id="e70">Name <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Lei</p>
<p>There is a Western proverb that "reputation" is a person's second life, and our country also says that after three generations, people are afraid of having a bad "name," so the importance of "name" can be known.</p>
<p>Because of the importance of "name," people want to "seek" fame and reputation to win a smile. On the one hand, they earn wicked money, and on the other hand, they hang a sign of compassion, using the "name" method to cover up the inferior description, which is the same as hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat, and the same as being despicable, the so-called full of benevolence, righteousness and morality, but with the heart of a poisonous snake and a fierce beast.</p>
<p>"Name" is where reality returns. Work silently, and the results will be obvious. Don't want "name" and "name" will come. If you don't start with the facts themselves, but only want to win a good "name," even if you succeed, it will only be a little "name" like a昙花, and it will disappear in no time.</p>
<p>"Name can be sought, but reality cannot be sought." It is also said: "If you only work hard to seek fame, and do not hesitate to sacrifice everything to pursue fame, then "name" will be a burden on the body." That's true.</p>
<p>Therefore, "for the supreme person, name is acceptable, no name is also acceptable... name, a small thing enough to be a burden to me, I only do what I should do, isn't it happy!"</p>
<h3 id="e71">Common Knowledge of Vaccination <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Ming</p>
<p>The warm spring has come, and it is also a suitable season to start vaccinating. In order to protect the general health of citizens, the authorities in this city have set up temporary free vaccination sites these days, and hope that everyone can go to vaccinate automatically to prevent the spread of smallpox. In the past, the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon said, "A good doctor does not treat the disease that has already occurred, but treats the disease that has not yet occurred," which is what this means.</p>
<p>Here we briefly describe a general overview of vaccination: it was first exported from India, and at that time it was by means of variolation, that is, selecting a person who has smallpox with a milder illness, peeling off his scab, grinding it into a fine powder, and then blowing this powder into the nose of a healthy person, so that he develops mild smallpox to resist the poison and gain immunity; later, after painstaking research in England, cowpox was invented, which can achieve artificial immunity.</p>
<p>Infants must be vaccinated once within four to eight months after birth, and should not be restricted by the season, because at this time the child has no fear and will not scratch after being vaccinated. If the result is very good after vaccination, it can guarantee that he will not develop smallpox for five or six years. After this period, he should be vaccinated once more. If the results of the vaccination are good, and he can get the method right, after three vaccinations, he can guarantee that he will not develop smallpox in his life. There are also cases where babies are vaccinated ten months after birth, and if they are fully vaccinated, they should be vaccinated in the second stage at the age of six; if they are not fully vaccinated, they should be revaccinated at the same time the following year. If they are still not fully vaccinated, they should be revaccinated the following year. In short, the second stage of vaccination must be completed before the age of ten, and the third stage of vaccination should be administered around the age of twenty. However, there are exceptions. It is always better to vaccinate more. If smallpox is prevalent, regardless of whether it has been vaccinated or not, it must be revaccinated, without being too rigid. As for the time, it can be done in all four seasons, but it is most convenient in the cool seasons of spring and autumn, March and April, and September and October. If smallpox occurs, vaccination should be carried out at any time and any place. The most obvious thing after vaccination is itching, but it cannot be scratched arbitrarily, because there are often small clean objects on the nails, and if you are not careful, it can easily cause suppuration and ulceration, or cause systemic, local ulceration. The air in the room must be circulated, and the light should be slightly dim, or red light can be used, which is most suitable. In our country's customs, when a child is vaccinated, he often wears a red hat on his head and a red cloth on his body, which is what this means. As for the diet, it should be easy to digest and have a flowing, non-irritating consistency.</p>
<p>When a person is infected with a virus, he should develop the disease. If there is a strong resistance in the body, it can of course be avoided. This is what is called immunity; however, immunity is innate and acquired. Innate immunity means that there are immune factors present from birth. Acquired immunity means that it is achieved by artificial treatment after birth or by being immune after suffering from a disease once. Among them, it can be divided into two situations. When the body has no resistance to the virus, or when it has resistance but not enough, you can take the blood of others or animals that contains abundant substances that can resist this disease to supplement it. If the body has no resistance or insufficient resistance, you can introduce attenuated viruses, which have no harm to the vaccinated person, and the body gradually produces resistance to prevent the spread of the disease. Sometimes, after suffering from a certain infectious disease, the body also produces resistance to the disease, so that it will not be reinfected with this disease in the future, which is also called automatic immunity. Vaccination uses the method of automatic immunity. Nine to eleven days after vaccination, immunity can be obtained, which can last for at least several years or even decades, depending on the individual's constitution.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Talking About "Decisiveness" <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Shu An</p>
<p>A person who is said to have no decisiveness is a person who hesitates. When they encounter an event, they are indecisive, should they do it or not? Should they take it or give it up? They start to hesitate, and as a result, they don't start anything, and they waste a good time on this hesitation, procrastinating until they are old. Their lives pass in hesitation.</p>
<p>People with decisiveness are the exact opposite. They use their decisiveness to judge whether this thing should be done or not, taken or given up, and work in an orderly manner according to the decision, and finally reach the stage of success. In their minds, there is no such thing as hesitation in the world, so they can seize the opportunity and create great careers in a short life, which people without decisiveness can never catch up with. From this point of view, being smart without decisiveness is not as good as being stupid with decisiveness. Therefore, Taishi Gong said: "The hesitation of a fierce tiger is not as good as the sting of a bee; the stagnation of a noble horse is not as good as the steady pace of a stupid horse; the suspicion of Mencius is not as good as the inevitable arrival of an ordinary man. Although there is the wisdom of Shun and Yu, humming without speaking is not as good as the pointing of the blind and deaf..." This shows the advantages and disadvantages of having or not having decisiveness.</p>
<p>However, I have to say that decisiveness is not arbitrary. Decisiveness is based on one's own reason, self-confidence and experience, and is judged after careful consideration, so it is reasonable. It is not arbitrary to act rashly, relying entirely on temporary emotions and arbitrarily judging. In short, we need to have decisiveness, which is an indispensable potential for success. However, we should use it properly and never abuse it arbitrarily and hastily.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Envy and Enthusiasm <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Ying</p>
<p>"Envy" is similar in meaning to "admiration," and it is the starting point of all success. If a person is attracted and stimulated by something and shows "envy," then he must have become interested in something and further have "attempts" and "hopes."</p>
<p>However, "envy" is only a temporary effect on the psychology. It is like a bubble mirage, which will disappear invisibly when the emotional climax gradually declines. If you keep "envy" for a considerable period of time and let it grow in your heart, new "hopes" will grow with it.</p>
<p>Having "hope" is like seeing light in the darkness, making everything have vitality; the things in the past ideals have the possibility of realization. However, "hope" is just "hope." If you don't work hard to promote the realization of "hope," isn't it the same as fantasy? Therefore, in the middle of the distance between the two, you must use "enthusiasm" to work hard in a down-to-earth manner!</p>
<p>If you do things with "enthusiasm," eight or nine times out of ten you will be able to succeed, and you will also get an unexpected harvest. A worker who can work "enthusiastically" is like a shining lamp in a dry and lonely desert, which will always make you pursue the goal unremittingly; it can enable workers to open up new paths on the road of life struggle adventurously; a "enthusiastic" person is not afraid of failure or difficulties, and his emotions are always enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Therefore, "envy" and "enthusiasm" are also two conditions for success; having "envy" can produce desire, and having "enthusiasm" can turn desire into reality. Improper "envy" often becomes jealousy, which is very dangerous; just "envy" without "enthusiasm" is like fantasy; if you are "enthusiastic" for a while and cannot have "perseverance," it is also very regrettable.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Life <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Chuang</p>
<p>Life is a road, a long road. Everyone must walk from the starting point to the end point. However, on this road, everyone has their own way of walking, everyone has their own path. Some people take the shortcut and choose the original road that the predecessors have taken, regardless of the advantages and disadvantages, and still follow it as it is. Some people skillfully find the diameter, the purpose is to find an easier road to walk. But there are also people with far-sighted vision who take all kinds of risks and difficulties. When it is possible to continue walking on this small road, he will open up a road in the thorny mountains and fields. He will drive away the sea when he meets it. He will drive away the wild beasts when he encounters them. He not only does it for himself, but also for others. He awakens a group of people and asks everyone to create a new avenue and recognize the real goal.</p>
<p>This is the right life.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Before and After Success <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Lu</p>
<p>Some people say, "It is a very difficult thing to create." However, maintaining something that has already been created is equally difficult. In the stage of "success," these two important steps of creation and maintenance are indispensable.</p>
<p>When anything is created, it will inevitably be ridiculed by the world, and even face many obstacles, preventing you from achieving "success" smoothly. After you have gone through all kinds of hardships to achieve victory, you must work hard to avoid the jealousy of others and avoid being poisoned.</p>
<p>In this way, is it too difficult to accomplish something? But it is not as difficult as it is said. As long as we cultivate ourselves to have: perfect character, profound cultivation, and rich experience, then it is not very difficult to accomplish anything.</p>
<p>In the world, there are often many people who think that when something has been "successful," this thing is over, and they no longer pay attention to it very carefully. Unexpectedly, after a long time, it is slowly forgotten. Then, wouldn't the hard work spent by the founder be a pity? It is truly the so-called, "Failure to carry a basket of earth will result in all previous efforts being wasted."</p>
<p>Indeed: "Starting a business is difficult, and the responsibility of those who die later is heavy." This sentence is truly penetrating and clear. If only the founders start a business, and those who die later do not honor the efforts of the martyrs and work hard to expand it; then the business that was created will eventually be ruined. Therefore, those who die later must shoulder the responsibility of maintaining and expanding it.</p>
<p>Founders certainly need decisiveness, self-confidence, perseverance, perseverance... and other elements of "success"; however, maintainers also need them. We must not think that as long as we arbitrarily hide behind people and enjoy the business that people have already created, we can maintain it and have more than enough. We must also have considerable knowledge to be able to apply other people's inventions.</p>
<p>Creation before success cannot achieve "success": but, if you do not continue to work hard after success, then the "success" you get will become "nothing."</p>
<h3 id="e76">Heaven? Earth? People? <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Luo</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Heavenly timing is not as good as geographical advantage, and geographical advantage is not as good as human harmony." This is indeed a very true saying. However, we can add: "Human harmony" is important, but sometimes it is not as effective as "self-improvement."</p>
<p>Just think, does a person who only wants to rely on friends and relatives have any ambition to improve? He must always only want others to help him and get something for nothing. He no longer thinks about how to work hard and how to develop, and create a world of his own.</p>
<p>Just imagine a person who specializes in social interaction and has a wide range of contacts, no matter how eloquent he is, no matter how his friends keep saying, "I will definitely help, I will definitely help..." If he does not become more motivated, his friends will slowly leave him.</p>
<p>Isn't it? There are many people in society who, unfortunately, are eliminated because they "rely on others and do not improve themselves." However, there are still many people who do not wake up, and live like parasites, stealing peace and indulging in pleasure and death.</p>
<p>Wake up! People in the Yellow Millet Dream.</p>
<p>We must work hard to be self-reliant, and other people's strength cannot be relied on.</p>

<h3 id="e78">The Resurrected Poor Woman: Gao Ruan Dies Despite Efforts <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The case of the poor woman Gao Ruan, who briefly revived in the Nanshi district, drew extraordinary attention from all sides. Supporters offered financial assistance, visitors came to express their concern, and hospital doctors provided treatment. However, due to the severity of her illness, despite the best efforts of both Chinese and Western doctors, she ultimately succumbed and passed away yesterday at 3:05 PM, at the age of 27. She was originally from Shaoxing. Our reporter personally visited her, delivering a慰劳费 (consolation fee) of 800 yuan. A summary of the treatment expenses after her revival is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Report from the nurse at the Guoyi Pingmin Hospital (National Medicine Public Hospital) at 88 Rue Robert: The patient's illness began in early November of last year with vomiting and diarrhea, worsening around the first month of the lunar new year, with episodes of fainting, including one episode where she remained unconscious for seven hours. On the 16th of this month, she was referred to our hospital for treatment by Mr. Zhuang Yaosheng. Dr. Zhao Yu examined her and deemed her condition critical, noting blurred vision, diarrhea, intermittent confusion, a dry tongue coating, a weak pulse of 140 beats per minute, and a body temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius. It was decided to use a method to strengthen her vital energy and reduce fever. Dr. Jiang Shuzhong (Head of Internal Medicine at Jimin Hospital) was also consulted for a detailed examination, which confirmed the critical state. Dr. Ding Jimin also visited the hospital for a thorough examination and agreed on the severity. They proposed administering saline, glucose, vitamin BC, and cardiac stimulants. Despite several days of both injections and medicine, and the combined efforts of Chinese and Western medicine, her body remained in a critical state due to extreme anemia. Her temperature has now dropped below normal, but her pulse remains around 120 beats per minute, with intermittent confusion. According to doctors, there is a possibility of collapse at any time. (Additional note) Mr. Sun Guyi from the Shendan Pharmaceutical Factory donated various injections and medicines, Dr. Jiang Shuzhong donated cardiac stimulants and medicinal liquids, Mr. Shi Yunfu donated Vitamin B, and Mr. Wen Lantin, chairman of the hospital, donated rice and Taibao Ling (brand of nutritious food).</p>
<p>(2) Dr. Shu Shuyun not only provided free treatment to Gao Ruan but also covered transportation costs and made a donation, demonstrating true empathy. His warmheartedness is evident in his letter: Gao Ruan's limbs warmed, and her mind became clear when first treated by this doctor, and she was able to eat a little. In recent days, her condition became unpredictable under the care of the hospital. Yesterday, her condition deteriorated, and her husband, Gao Weiren, seeing her worsen, reluctantly invited this doctor to the hospital again. After examination, the doctor found the condition even more dangerous than before and reluctantly prescribed medicine. Upon returning home after taking the medicine, she soon passed away. This doctor, unable to stand by idly, is willing to send 100 中儲劵 (Central Reserve Bank notes) earned in peacetime to fulfill his human obligation. (Editor's note: Mr. Pan Shanshi also sent 100 yuan, bringing the total to 200 yuan, which, along with the 610 yuan donated by various parties the previous day, will be handed over to her husband, Mr. Gao Weiren, to arrange the funeral).</p>
<h3 id="e79">Medical Treatment at Various Hospitals <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
