<p>社評</p>
<h3>取締走私消滅黑市</h3>
<p>米糧統制委員會在市民熱烈期待的情緒中，在客觀環境迫切需要中產生。自八月底開始籌備，歷時匝月，甫經成立，迄今將及四月，內部職員二百七十餘人，外埠又近千人，動用經費數萬萬元，截至目前為止，該會工作成績如何？對於民食貢獻如何？我們願意忠實的客觀的檢討一下，以與該會及社會人士商　之。</p>
<p>九月八日，袁主任委員對新中國報記者談稱：「米糧採辦原係極困難之工作，固不論過去米糧聯營社成績如何，今後自當設法革新，本人自當本諸服務社會為民福利原則，率領同人，共同努力於此項民生重要問題之工作，同人等當在可能範圍內，使本市民食無虞，以副市民殷切之期望·」</p>
<p>十月九日，袁主任委員談話：「……欲使統制之成功，人事問題亦極重要，米糧統制方在萌芽，尤應樹以先聲，建立楷模，屨登忝居領導，對於全體工作人員，必當嚴加督飭，務使弊絕風淸，社會人士耳目所及，亦盼隨時注意，隨時檢舉，庶幾觀聽易周，克完使命。」</p>
<p>十一月六日新中國報消息，據米統會方面報吿，，各米區每月可設法籌運廿七萬包食米來滬，與從前米糧聯營社每月十五萬寓包之數相比，已增加一倍，按戶配給，每月每期配給米可望增至二升至二升半之間。</p>
<p>十一月廿六日中央社訊，採購工作之推進，甚為順利，該會各地區採辦商所收米糧，已有相當數量，不日即常大量運滬，以濟民食。</p>
<p>十一月廿七日中央社訊，米統會近以二市區米糧走私日益猖獗，影響糧政，除分令所屬各地區辦事處加强統制收購工作外，復請本市警務機關協力取締走私，以重糧政。</p>
<p>十二月八日消息，糧統會對於採辦米棧，積極進行，各地區米糧，均已有大量之收集，但以運輸上稍有不便，以致本市戶口米略有稽延，經竭力調整下，最近已運到民食米十萬担，決將此項米糧，充作配給戶口米之用，並聞大批米糧，正在源源運滬途中，大致在二十日以前，即可計口配給。</p>
<p>上面摘錄米統會成立以後的公開消息，有的是該會當局發表的，有的是該會認可的，總之，這些都是米統會向民衆提供的信用保證，在民衆的立塲，必須要求兌現的。因為民食問題的重要，絕不是兒戲的事。</p>
<p>現在，我們進一步檢討米統會的工作，別的不說，僅以戶口米配給而言，四個月來，祇有八期八升。與以的比較，則「減量」與「誤期」兩缺點，已為鐵的事實，况且，這數期配給，還不是米統會直接辦理，尙是以前的存米。這此都是米統會當局未能兌現信用保證，未能克書所負使命。</p>
<p>統制經濟，在我國尙屬創舉，推行前途的順利與否，完全繋於民衆的認識與協力如何？而取得民衆的認識與協力，必先樹立統制經濟的信用。米糧統制，是統制經濟中主要的民生物品，尤須樹立信用。但米統會四閱月來，所予民衆的印象，却是屢次失信，其後果則為削弱統制經濟推行的功效，同時，民食受到更嚴重的威脅。</p>
<p>其次，因戶口米愈配給愈少，黑市米價格就愈益上漲，目前已至每石二千四五百元。我們對於這種現象，不禁發生疑問：</p>
<p>如果說戶口米減少配給，因為米糧不足吧！則黑市米源源供給，從何處取得？</p>
<p>如果說戶口米減少配給，因為運輸困難吧！則黑市米又如何可來？</p>
<p>米糧旣經統制，何以還有走私？米糧旣經官價配給，何以還有黑市？有走私，有黑市，統制者則又諉責與誰？</p>
<p>旣不能統制採辦，取締走私，又不能配給足量，消滅黑市。因循坐誤，徒苦民生，何以自解？</p>
<p>總而言之，依照目前事實，米糧　不恐慌，運輸並不過難，因為黑市米可以源源而來，而問題焦點在於戶口米官價與黑市米暗盤之間，差額太鉅，於是利令智昏，不上軌道，對於米統會簽發採辦證有作弊情事，外間嘖有煩言，即此一例。最近商統會棉業管理處職員有作弊情事，該會當局卽澈查嚴懲，不稍寬貸，很足為米統會當局最現實的榜樣，希望切實偵查嚴懲。同時，米統會各級人員，必須澈底自肅，發揚為民食而服務的責任心，絕對做到無走私，無黑市，配給足量，配給準期的地步，否則因循坐誤，不能任令少數人的失職，血苦了大衆的生活。</p>
<h3>達拉瓦瑪金兩島　日守軍壯烈殉國　奮戰六日予優勢敵軍重創</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日大本　二十日下午三時十五分發表：守衛達拉瓦島及　金島之帝國海軍陸戰隊，自于一月二十一日以來，即以寡兵三千，邀擊敵登陸軍五萬餘，奧熾烈執　之敵機轟炸及艦上射擊相對抗·連日奮戰結果，予敵以數倍於我之重大損害，幷牽制敵有力之機動部隊，對友軍之海空作戰頗多貢獻，於十一月二十五日實行最後之突擊，全員即行玉碎·指揮官為　軍少將柴崎惠次。又曾於該兩島始終協力守備隊奮戰之軍屬約千五百名，亦已玉碎。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　關於守　達拉瓦島·瑪金島之日海軍陸戰隊及軍屬全體玉碎事，大本營業已發表、此次玉碎之日軍計海軍陸戰隊　　名、設管工作等軍　一千五百名。指揮官為柴崎惠次少將，“海　陸矓隊曾於昭和七年及十二年因在上海奮戰，而勇名廣被於世界，至是於其歷史上乃添燦爛之一頁，此等陸戰隊與軍　在最前綫所完成之偉大任務，及所及於戰爭全局之彩響，實罄竹難書，因通訉機關之破壞過早，兩島守備隊之戰隊經過雖不能完全得悉，但　觀諸外電所傳，亦可明　其奮戰之一斑，此在世界戰史上固為永垂不杇之一頁也，於此吾人尤可注意者，乃一千五百名軍屬，亦隨同陸戰隊戰至最後一同玉碎之事實，最前綫島嶼需要如此衆多之軍屬者，實為使此島嶼成為助衛日本土之第一綫據點，以阻止敵軍之侵攻，故將該地之各種設施加以　大强化乃所必要，而此等軍屬遼其玉碎之前，亦無日無時不協力部隊，遂行其任務，　記東鄕元帥之言，由海而來之敵人，以　防之，而島國日本之第一綫，即在太平洋上也，　局之現况已愈現緊張，現已至決戰且為突入長期戰之時，當此決戰之時，繼玉碎之四千五百英魂而　關，實為長期戰必勝之道，四千五百英魂，亦即日本一億民衆總奮戰中之警鐘。</p>
<h3>日陸戰隊　奮戰情况</h3>
<p>栗原大佐昨晚廣播</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電日大本營海軍報道部課長栗原悅藏大佐，二十日下午七時二十分，在此問中央廣播電合廣播守備達拉瓦·瑪金兩島之日陸戰隊及協力該作戰之軍屬等奮戰情况，茲　其大意如改：大本　本日發表，守備達拉瓦·瑪金兩島之三千海軍陸戰隊及一千五百名軍屬·自十一月十九日以來，即於吉　貝特　島邀擊來襲敵有力之機　部隊及敵登陸軍約五萬，全體竭力奮戰，於重創敵軍後，壯烈殉國，充分發揮成</p>
<p>海軍光輝</p>
<p>之傳統精神。美國深恐我國愈益加强杼戰中所　赫赫戰果所確立之必勝不敗態勢與確立大東亞共榮圈偉業之日益推進，最近乃高呼「勿予日本以時間」，並從速發動大規模之反攻，如十一月一日敵企圖以航空母艦及戰艦多艘、在所羅門　島之波根維爾島登陸，我　軍都隊及航空部隊接報後，當即竭力反攻，於該島附近海面數次經潰敵軍，擊沉與擊毀敵航空母艦十一艘，戰艦，巡洋艦，　逐艦，運輸船等九十四艘擊落敵機五百七十六架。敵之反攻於所羅門方面受挫後，復於十一月十九日出動有力之機動部隊，（係以航空母艦，戰艦為基幹），　衛運輸船團來　吉爾貝特軍島我前進基地達拉瓦及瑪金兩島，我海軍陸戰隊即予以邀擊。是日來　於　島之敵機，約有九百架，投彈如雨，故一部防禦設施被毀。</p>
<p>守備隊員</p>
<p>略有傷亡，然守備隊員之鬥志反愈形軒昻，於敵機猛炸中，擊落其三十一架，二十日晨又有敵機二百數十架，再炸該島。並以戰艦，巡洋艦及　逐艦等五艘，砲擊該島　　小時之久。我陸戰隊當即反攻，擊落敵機二十三架。同一時刻前後有敵機三百架來　瑪金島，該島陸戰隊當即將其擊退，擊落敵機十二架，二十日拂曉，敵於接近該兩島筏，即以水陸兩用坦克車一百數十輛及登陸用舟艇數百艘開始登陸，與我睦戰部隊展開激烈之陸上戰鬥。敵軍轟炸並砲轟該　島雨日，約費砲彈二千二百噸，炸彌七百噸，敵認我陸戰隊之抵抗力已盡，然待機中之我陸戰隊，於敵登陸用舟艇駛近岸邊，然後開始射擊，使其大半沉沒海中，敵軍當即陷於混亂狀態，敵軍前鋒坦克車隊被我堅固之坦克壕及重火器陣地所陷，或起火　坐，或中彈顚覆，敵軍登陸用舟艇或被炸粉碎，或顛覆海中，敵當時登陸部隊即被殲滅在水邊，但敵軍恃衆，增派生力軍進攻，且</p>
<p>於天明時</p>
<p>又出動大批戰鬥機及轟炸機，猛炸我軍陣地，致我軍陸戰隊亦漸感實力削弱。終被敵軍在該島一角登陸，但我軍士氣益趨旺盛。據二十一日正式報吿，我軍經激戰後，雖損折相當兵力，但仍將五千餘登陸敵軍驅逐至海岸，擬在傍晚由三方面包圍殲滅之。自十九日　以來，我軍幾整夜不眠，連日不飲不食，繼續激戰，故敵軍經二十一日夜日軍陸戰隊之猛攻後，已蒙受重創，一時未敢登陸但敵軍終窺破我軍勢寡，更調派大部生力軍，於二十二晨開始登陸，企圖一舉解決我軍陸戰隊，但我軍已抱死守決心，於敵軍猛炸及砲擊下，以寡兵迎擊大隊敵軍，並不後退寸步。據是日下午一時報告，「戰况並無變化」。但此電拍發後，達拉瓦島與瑪金島間之連絡，想因無錢電發報機被破壞，音息即告中斷，故此後不能知悉國島日軍陸戰隊員之奮戰情况。惟據協力作戰之友軍飛機偵察及敵方之公布。，可推測共　過　要如次：我軍陸戰隊員於二十二日深夜接奉天皇之優　聖旨，</p>
<p>全體益勇</p>
<p>氣百倍，浴血酷戰，據二十三日駛往救援之友軍飛機偵察狀况，判明我軍堅守前日之陣　，並未後退一步，但　軍　戰隊員愈戰愈感勢力單薄，敵軍則時時調這新軍登陸，故吾軍司令官柴崎少將目諸此種緊急情况，乃於親　部　行入敵陣。美海軍當局亦　稱：『達拉瓦島作戰，係開戰以來美軍所交付之最大犧牲，在此短期問內戰死者，竟如是之衆，實屬戰史空前所未有。』當時”海軍機隊及潛水艇隊又迎擊海上之敵航空母艦，戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦等敵艦多艘。因敵軍企圖一舉攻佔達拉瓦島及瑪金島也。經數次實施攻擊後，即擊沉敵航空母艦十一艘，戰艦，巡洋艦等計七艘，　極大戰果。達拉瓦瑪金兩島之我海軍陸戰隊三千將士，困守太平洋上之一孤島，迎擊</p>
<p>敵軍五萬大軍，重創敵軍及至最後一兵，猶頑强死守兩島，　利用敵軍之無　心理，收獲　　戰果，此在生產力素稱强大之美國，亦已蒙受大打擊，非經長時期不能恢復也。我海軍陸戰隊三千將士血染赤道下之　瑚礁，成就偉大犧牲，使我軍全體作戰作有力之展開。洵塔嘖贊也。司令官柴崎少將會任上海海軍特別陸戰隊參謀長，歷一年有半，對於陸戰方面尤　毅沉着，窺機極敏，臨陣率先赴難之機，必期　澈素志，實為常與部下共同苦樂之典型武將也。現敵英美正　舉總力對我反攻，但　處太平洋上之無數島嶼，係我軍之前進基地，與我海軍部隊共同構成</p>
<p>鐵壁守衛</p>
<p>陣，守軍將士，均抱一死之決心，敵英美　恃其　富之物資，及龐大之生產力量，着着實施反攻，但在我軍之前，終屬徒勞無功而已。</p>

<h3>日本臨重大時期　決推進强力政治　八十四屆議會定週五召集</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日第八十四屆定例議會·即將於本月廿四日如期召開，政府方面已準備於本議會中提出之預算法、　政會亦從事作縝密之　查。政府　於隊此重大時期，決以鞏固政治力為唯一要務，集中國內名方面之勞力、推進張力之決戰政治，　　會乃以激發國民之旺盛戰意與堅持擁護政府之態度為主要課　，是此次議會之主要議題，將為昻揚必勝信念與增强生產力方策。東條首相於此次議會之施政演說，將說明波根維爾島吉爾貝特島及緬甸中國方面之戰况·以及歐洲方面之戰局，率直表明日軍雄偉之作戰與今後之歸趨，以激動國民一致奮起，更將闡明以後大東亞會議為中心之共榮團建設問題，政府方面幷　　此機會昭告國民切實努力俾達成以上各種目的。又關於增產飛機船舶確保食糧等項，亦將成為本議會之中心議題，關於將在此次議會中提出之決戰增稅案，亦將作種種縝密之計議，尤可想及者，即於此次議會中必將產生富有歷史性之大言論，預料此次議會中對施政方針演說之質問者亦將佔有相當人數，又每屆議會中關於縮短審議時間問題，典其謂之縮短，勿　謂置議論於重點，且有謂延長會期與事無礙者，　議會長期召開，乃因日政府與議會完全維繫有表裏一體之關係，在此種情形下，頗可增强效果，又主張應使議會為決戰體制之一翼而充分加以活用者亦頗衆，此誠暗示此次議會之特點。</p>
<h3>美違反國際公法　盲炸醫院船　日提嚴重抗議</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　敵方　戰局之　烈化，屢作不法行為。敵潛艇飛機　擊日　海軍醫院船事件，自去歲四月二十六日海軍醫院船髙砂丸遭敵潛艇不法攻擊以來，已達十一次之多，日本已兩次經由利益代表國對敵方提出嚴重抗議，要求敵方反省，並喚起敵方今後之注意。然敵方不僅　祝此等抗議，且於十一月二十七日上午八時十分在新愛爾蘭島加比恩格北方二百公里海上，以統一式B24型機一架對日　軍醫院船布宜諾斯艾利斯丸加以不法轟炸，而將該船炸沉，結果日軍雖極力救助，而死傷及失踪者仍達百七十四名之多，（包含向後方運送之傷兵及衛生　員看護　船員）敵機不顧鮮明之紅十字標幟，更以機槍掃射　小艇　難之遭難者，其後日方即詳細調查生存者及當時遭　悄形。最近始判明眞相。今敵方之不法行為。自已無法掩飾，日　野上下無不異常激憤。日大本管陸軍報道部長於十二月十日之講演中，亦曾指出此等事實，痛詆敵之不法。此次日外務奢決定正式提出抗議、詳細指明此次事件經日方調查後之眞相，追究敵方應負責任，要求保障今後不再發生同樣事件。敵方若不採取誠意措置、日本亦將採斷然處置，該抗議書已由日本利益代表國西班牙轉交美國，一切手續已由日駐西須磨公使辦理竣事。</p>

<p>日外交當局於而十日發表談話後，並發表抗議文如次：　帝國醫院船布宜諾斯艾利斯丸於十一二十七日上午八時十分在南緯二度四十分東經四十九度二十分之海上航行中，方舷一突受來　之美圃統一式B24型飛機一架投下之炸彈，歷時約四十分而沉沒。該飛機乃背向太陽於高約一千米上空，向該船之尾　飛來，投下炸彈一　後，即沒於前方雲問·該船遭難後救命艇小汽艇等約十八艘即時下水·傷病兵及其他乘船者之全員殆均於該船沉沒前被救上救命艇或筏上。然第四號船艙之重傷病兵及其他人員約卅名，則因被炸彈　動而落下之艙口棟梁壓斃或受傷，興該船同時沉沒，滿載傷病兵之舟艇因通　機關破壞，遂致無法聯絡。自十一月二十七日至十二月二日間在海上漂流中，復　數度被美國哨戒機發見，每次被發見均曾以紅布作成紅十字，置于艇之中央部以為標幟，該哨戒機亦曾于低空　出此等標幟，然十二月一日之哨戒機則曾于百米左右之超低空，對漂流中滿載傷病兵之舟艇以機槍掃　，是次死二名傷一名。迄十二月二日下午漂流中之一部舟艇，始發見航行于附近之帝國船舶，基其報吿，帝國飛機與舟艇乃于二日至三日之間，將該　　餘漂流者完全收容，結果連同看　婦死亡及失踪者共一七四名。　一九〇七年締結海牙條約時，規定日內瓦條約原則適用於海戰，日本政府根據該條約第一條之規定，曾于去歲十二月七日假利益代表團西班牙政府將布宣諾斯艾利斯丸船名通知美國政府，且除根據該條約第五條之規定，　有法令標識外，尙裝有帝國軍當局所研究特製之極易認識之對空及夜用紅十字標識，此亦已通知美國政府，且是時天氣睛期背向太陽，由高度一千米左右·絕可完全識出此等標識，美機所行盲炸事件，匪僅故意遠反海牙條約及國際法之根本原則，抑且有背人道，况曾使無辜之看護慘亡，幷以機槍掃射漂流于水中之傷病兵，此誠可謂近于野　而卑劣之殺害行為。　帝國玫府關于此事件，已對美國政府提出嚴重抗議，幷促其反省俾使該國政府連以誠意徹查眞象予以答覆，幷處罰責任者，保障將來不　發生此等事件，同時幷宣言保留矯正此不法行為之一切權利。帝國政府前因阿刺伯丸等六艘醫院船遭不法攻擊，而曾經利益代表國西班牙於六月二十八日對美政府提出嚴重抗議，惟迄今未接答覆，其後此種不法攻擊事件仍層出不窮，最近復因高砂丸等四艘醫院船被襲，而　利益代表團通告美政府。今竟又發生布宜諾斯艾利斯丸被擊沉事件，是以帝國政府乃再慎重喚起美政府之深切注意。</p>
<p>大鹽大佐　發表談話</p>
<p>東京廿日中央社電　自日政府公布抗議美國炸沉日醫院船文吿後，日本全國無人不切　痛憤。回憶開戰時，日海軍攻擊夏威夷軍港內所有之軍艦船舶，　被擊沉或擊破，惟敵方之醫院船，則未被攻擊，日本此種武士道精神曾使當地日僑盛泣不已。然而美英竟再三　　日本醫院船以為報酬，此實為人神所公憤。而空軍人員竟報吿擊沉日本優秀輸送船一集，同時美國當局復將其列入戰籍內，庶以欺騙國民，世間之厚顏者，實無過於此。茲日本紅十字會醫院主幹大鹽大佐，對於此事特發表談話，略謂，敵方此種非法行為，實出吾人意外，吾等一億國民，惟有再度鞏固決意，擊滅敵美而已。美國破壞紅十字法，且不以為恥，已除去其人道之假面具，而露出野　形骸，今已在實際上，彼等因屢戰　北，苦悶不已，美英之精神戰綫，已被日本突破，我人決為謀世界之和平，不問是非，堅持決心打到美國。</p>
<h3>日軍在緬邊境　採迂迴包圍　敵反攻動脈已被切斷</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　據緬甸前綫某基地電，緬甸前錢日軍對富貴方面渝印軍新編第卅八師及哈　密方面敵聯合軍，自十月下旬即開始猛攻，到處將其擊潰，收獲莫大戰果。由敵軍之動態而觀，可知其自怒江作戰失敗，喪失奪囘緬甸之　要據點後，顯欲向覓第二據點，故十月下旬以來，即於富貴方面大　活動。同時美駐印空軍亦增强實力，據充丁蘇基阿機塲一帶之軍事設備·並藉空輸路　力運　重要軍需資材。被置於　前綫之渝軍·囚受日軍攻擊印度之威脅，　有脫逃者印新編第三十八師，第百十二，百十四兩團、利用貫通倫特達加布之汽車路，越過邊境綫，巴特加山脈，而集合於達加布，即以此處為分歧點，一部侵入達倫　德　河上游西岸地區，在沿岸各方面從事蠢動，其主力在新布羅正面活動。又另一部即在塔面窺何反攻之機會，又十一月下旬第三十八師增派一百十三團，往該分岐點，並調新　第二十二師主力，由列頓方面南下，用作預備軍，並將在　加爾（加爾加答西北方）約三百公里哈　密方面聯合軍司令部　往列頓方面，逐漸採取進攻態勢。至於日軍則克服一切目助之惡條件，在該地區實施迂迴包圍，或乘敵軍之虛，切斷敵軍反攻之動脈，增强進攻哈　密之態勢，當時日陸軍機攻擊了蘇基阿之赫赫戰果？曾使該方面　軍為之　　、同時美駐渝空軍亦　受莫大之损害與威脅，更經日軍地上都隊之猛攻，故緬印邊境之敵軍，遭　　亂狀態，如再不退却，則有被殲滅之虞。</p>
<h3>芬希哈罕及波島激戰均在進行中</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　據南平洋日軍某基地電、新幾內亞島芬希哈罕地區，　仍繼續激戰中，宗古河北岸方面，優勢敵軍備有坦克車六七輛人，　前來攻擊，日坦克車隊即對之加以反擊，收獲戰果如次：日軍兵長率兵兩名，曾於十三日上午二時，潛入敵軍陣地，炸毀　迫擊　一門，機關　一門，帷幕一座（內有敵兵十名）。又日軍上等兵率肉搏攻擊班三名，曾於十三日上午六時，攻擊前來進攻敵坦克車，將敵之先鋒坦克車破　，並使其他坦克車不能前進。十四日上午十一時，攻擊前進中之敵軍右　，擊毀敵機槍一架，炸死敵兵二十名，日方負傷者一名。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　據南平洋日軍某基地電，日陸軍海上運輸隊，十二月十二日於新幾內亞島芬希哈罕附近，與敵大型魚雷艇三艘交戰，將其擊退，是役敵艇一艘起火，一艘中彈，日方無損害。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　南太平洋日軍某基地訊：日軍　在波根維爾島特羅　納角激戰中，本月七日至十一日止，在該角東北七公里比　亞附近所獲之戰果如次。美軍遺屍一七八具，日軍　獲重機槍一挺，輕機槍八挺，手槍十九支，子彈一四〇〇發。</p>

<h3>北京通訊　華北的出版界</h3>
<p>近代的新聞事業，負有宣傳的責任，而在每一時代都有其宣傳的方針和政策，是與當時的政局有密切的關聯的，華北新聞協會也就為了研討這方針和政策在本月三日假座北京飯店召開了第二次編輯長會議。這一次的會議參加的有四十餘家報社雜誌社的編輯長。上午由　輯委員會委員長楊大焯氏任主席，致開會詞，又由理事長管翼賢，日本大使館重富調查課長華北新聞資材協會理事長河崎義男，加藤報道部長致辭或演講。下午會餐畢，再正式的會議，先由主席報吿會務，再討論議案。這一次參加的報社雜誌社的名單無妨列在後面，算是一個小小的統計，也可以給海上人士知道華北出版界的情形。</p>

<p>統制製棉業</p>
<p>華北本是產棉區。但因為棉花和軍事工業的關係，棉織品的價格已漲到出人想像之外的程度。現在是一尺平常的白布或藍布已經售價五元　鈔以上了。一般平民無力購買結果就產生了一個現象，即碎棉，舊棉·彈棉等雜棉大形暢銷。影響所及，原棉上市大受阻礙。因此華北紡織工業會就決定將華北全區的製棉業者和他的交易對手雜棉處理業者都置在該會的統制之下，最近並且製好了一個統制綱要，想把華北的一切製棉工廠統合於五個製棉團：北京地區製棉團，天津地區製棉團，濟南地區製棉團，靑島地區製棉團，石門地區製棉團。此等製棉團正在着進行組織之中，預定於本月中旬　成。至於原棉的配給，則決定設立各期生產計劃，而基此分配各製棉團，再由團分配給各團員。此外又規定雜棉處理業者購入雜棉及其與外面之交易都須經過紡織工業會的許可。這也是戰爭時代一個統制經濟的辦法。</p>
<p>處罰不法商人</p>
<p>本年春天一部分因為劣商的據縱，糧價高漲，有如怒馬奔　之勢，弄得北京餓死的人到處都有，富時華北當局曾經以最大的努力想要被此難關，而南京方面也就通過了以軍法從事以懲治劣商法令。六月末華北當局也就大加檢舉不良商人，「捉到官裏去」的為數亦不在少、最近華北當局已將歷來處　各案公開發表，說是處罰七年監禁或其以下者共有六十一名，罰金七十萬元及其以下者共有四十三名，罰金八百萬元及其以下之商社共有七十八社。對於擾亂經濟的非法商人總算是加以嚴重的處罰了。（十二月十二日曼！寄）</p>

<h3>空中的寵兒　木製飛機</h3>
<p>自從出現了電波探　機之後，航空決戰的狀態為之一變。為對抗這近代戰的　兵器，乃產生了木製飛機。這木製飛機是用「强化木」製造的，製造這强化木，必須壓榨機械，日本政府近來乃要求全國的所有者獻出。用木材製造飛機，竟需要用從米糠和大豆，落花生，菜子等取油的壓榨機械，那眞是深有興味的事情。</p>
<p>但此種機械在　業上也是很重要的，所以軍需省對其獻出頗為　重。　玉縣與野　農民講道航長橫尾拂三郞傳聞這消息後，十一月二十五日赴軍需省訪遠藤航空兵器局長官，將該館使用的優秀壓榨機三架，為生產飛機而請求捐納：「如其必要，可不必等待遲緩的企業整備，請即使用」。該長官以這時候獻出之東西，非常感動地說：「把軍當局以為必要的東西親自請求獻納的精神，這是製造成眞正的日本的戰力。」接着他談起未來的空中寵兒木製飛機論和生產論如下：</p>
<p>木製飛機由來已久</p>
<p>「說到用木材製造飛機並不是什麼不可恩議的，以前早已用木製造了。大正十五年，我在大尉時代，被派遣到歐洲，為欲獲得日本飛機工業狀况的預備知識，乃視察名古屋某工廠。那時恰在檢査像桌子那麽大的一塊板。那板上如其有一個節就不合格了，三尺六尺一塊板，沒有節的很少，這是不能大量生產的。如其用金屬製造又將如何呢？「軍人或許祇知道戰爭，而不知道科學，金屬重而不能飛……」說着笑起來了。明年赴歐洲，看見德法都用金屬製，所以有現在的金屬性飛機活躍。但金屬性產生不利的地方。因有新兵器超矩波探信機，故在到目的地之前即被發見，飛機所視為生命的奇襲，頗為困難。於是硏究可以避免被發見的木製飛機。把木材切成薄薄的木片，將其　維互疊交錯，用樹脂膠粘起來，用壓榨機壓縮之，乃造成和金屬一樣强的强化木。用這來製造飛機。本製飛機決不是因為飛機不足而製造，乃是由於戰術上的要求所產生。（在製造那强化木時，壓榨機是必要的。）</p>
<p>後來又說到各國的木製機。</p>
<p>「最好的木材，須如金屬般有雖曲不折的堅固的柔韌性。英國甚至造成了蚊子型的變引擊　炸機，曾出現於緬甸方面，此次柏林的轟炸中或許也曾使用，美國也有，日本正在逐漸趕造，推進器，機體，機翼，一切邵在製造中。」</p>
<p>至此，語頭乃轉到對於獻納者及飛機工廠的希望。</p>
<p>生產絕無窮途</p>
<p>「我們軍需省方面，不相信有所謂生產的窮途。從各方面看來，如其專心一志的去做，沒有做不到的。燃料的問題，勢力的問題，工資的問題都是一樣。很多人說，無利可圖的事情，即使用全力也造不成功，精神是不能成功的，到　決戰時候，即在飛機工業中也有不少人不能脫却　錢主義。世界的科學到底趕不上的有日本　和神社的建築。如伊勢的神宮等；是沒有一點短處的建築、全世界早有定評。可是這些建築都是沒有　錢念頭的日本人的精神所造成的。如其用這精　製造一切兵器，質量上都必定可以壓倒英美。現在第一綫將士最需要的是武器，但精神尤其是絕對的。我是砲兵科出身，名　，死，恥辱，大砲，都曾受教，也曾敎過人家。如其見到馬來及其他海上，　槍待放就　的　土，和飛機一同自炸，與搭乘員，　船同歸於盡許多海軍將士愛　兵器的精神，則在軍需工廠中勞　的人們，自然理解不能不每天工作。波根維爾島空戰以來，飛機生產逐漸增加無論有戰果也好，沒有戰果也好，不能不一直這樣做下去，希望當事者有　進一步的奮起。對壓榨機的獻納者，也布望把現在使用的優良的機械，為飛機增產而迅速獻納。」（翔：自十一月二十七日每日新聞）</p>

<p>經濟界評言</p>
<h3>調查生活必需品</h3>
<p>物資調查委員會以本市物資復見繼濫現象，擬即請禾行政院提早進行　於民生必需品之調查工作，期收抑平物價之效，而本市各當局亦以最近一　以來，百物售價，平均又被抬高十分之八九，為求明悉眞相起見，曾經召集各業座談，藉資研討如何　定各柴物價。凡此　　，可知本市物價之嚴重性，已覺與日俱增，不容坐視了。</p>
<p>在短短的一週之間，物價可以平均抬高十分之八九，以視蔑邦日本，近二年來日常用品均採配給制度，物價並無變化，眞覺相去　壤，無怪不久以前來華訪問之日本名作家豐島氏對於上海各處陳列之價目，至盛驚異。我們認為物價政策的根本課題，絕非是片段的工作所能解決。調査生活必需品的要　，不僅在於澈査投機操縱的一類情事，而尤在於研究缺乏的癥結所在。因此，如何增進物資之來源？如何疏通物資之輸運？乃為調查過程中最基　的工作。經過了一番窮本探源的基層調査以後，再　物價統制之强化似乎在事實上較易成功，因為物價統制之成功，必須統制是從生產一直到消費那樣徹底，而物價的管理的機構，同時亦須特殊的健全。</p>
<h3>各主要都市設置物價調查會　澈查商民非法囤積</h3>
<p>當局為澈查蘇浙皖三省境內各主要都市商民非法囤積大量主要物資起見，特於各省政府或特別市政府所在地，分別設置地方物資調查委員會，各縣政府市政府所在地，分別設置地方物資調查委員會分會，記者昨自關係方面探悉，三省內各主要都市，在當地最高行政長官主持之下，業符物資調查委員會組織就緒，並以積極展開工作，其任務約有兩端，　關於主要物資囤　之調査事項，　關於防止囤積對策之建議事項。</p>
<h3>各行莊辦理年終總結賬</h3>
<p>民國三十二年度即將終了，本市銀錢業各行莊均已循例辦理總結賬，昨（二十）日起對於商業部及儲蓄部往來存款利息，一律辦理結息，所有各往來戶借款均須於本年終償還清楚，中央儲蓄銀行及銀　業聯合準備會　量供給頭寸，辦理同業拆放，以期安渡年關，茲悉本年度及各金融機關營業，均有盈餘云。</p>
<h3>證交因交割停市場外交易頗旺　各股多見軋升</h3>
<p>昨　股證交辦理交割停市一天，少數同業各在本號開做，成交頗旺，市面在盤旋中，上午先漲後囘、下午重堅，終各　股多見軋升。　幫紗花幫仍套進紗廠，致永安亦街出二百元關，而吐公司，致前者漲度比後者為速，照各方人心堅　。今分時各業股與後；</p>

<h3>國民論壇收買紗布應加改善諸點</h3>
<p>— 伯</p>
<p>政府為取　投機國情，抑平物偎。安定民生起見，有全面收買上海區城棉紗棉布之舉，奉公守法之正當紗布商人，深知服　國策，立即停業，將所有存貨如數依限申請出賣，罔敢　飾。今時及四月，米煤用品日益趨漲，業紗布者及興紗布柴有連繫之進商人，在退維谷之境地下，艱若萬狀，投機者目光他移，囤積者會此逐彼，物價仍未見抑平，民生且更難安定，是豈政府下令收買紗布時始料所及！茲將正當紗布商身受之痛苦，及收買紗布應改善諸要點。　列於後：</p>
<p>正當商人資金有限　，平時多賴行莊往來及親友存款以資調劑，今業務旣停，行莊自不能加欠，存　亦來索取，羅掘俱窮，應付為難。査收買紗布實施綱要所定價格，已照成本為廉，（約得收買時之市價四分之一）而分期付款最早者須滿三月，連者須俟三年，苟一商號雖有存貨百萬元，（以收買時之市價計）而負債僅二十五萬元者，（除去資本）雖得半數標金，然子息疊加，（莊欠月息三分）開支過增，收付已不能抵價，勢非破產不可。</p>
<p>收買紗布價格已定，而價欵旣不能一次取得，三十三年一月一日第一期付欵時，各種物價已不能如三十二年八月十日水準。此後時日更無把握。商人以取得價欵置辦米煤日用物品，則比率已失其平衡，即不負價，亦雖維持。　望政府援大東亞同盟後大赦罪犯例，網開一面，將特別定期存單，免息貼現半數，標金一次付給。</p>
<p>貨物為商人命脈，故商人之愛　货物，無罪子女，原件者或箱或包，散裝者，股架分置，整齊陳列，專置有人，收買後一經搬運，　　　脆，污漬　　，而中途短少，猶其餘事。今商統會由　及此，已將散裝紗布列入特准管理品，而已車去之散裝紗布，應請發還原申請出　人，妥為整理，安置架上，俾利配給。</p>
<p>戰時經濟常以增加生產為首要，自紗布收買，工廠停頓，商人斌闲。不但毫無生產，而虛耗開安，據布號業公會統計同業會員二千六百餘家，每月開文約須七千八百萬元，紗廠布廠紗號及與紗布連　之棉雜品彙傘廠等尙不知若干。應請從速配給，使工盡其能，商安其業，非特安定民生，而生產增加，亦抑平物價之要緊</p>
<p>配給程序有總批發商·批發商·零售商之分，紗布未統制前，外埠紗布商皆向滬地批發商採辦，今外埠總批發商階段似應援日商洋行例，由本埠批發商承裝。倘已規定由棉製品聯合會各地分會辦理，則此項利潤，亦應酌提若干，依照本埠批發商申請出賣存貨數額比例均　，以資公允。（批發商無一月之保留量，收買後所受之痛苦，為最深。查布號業會員零售商七百家，而批商家一千九百餘家。）紗布收買工作已　三月，雖名目繁移，檢收費時，但辦事應有預算。九月六日之期雖已改為十月一日，而商統會為體恤商艱，通告各申請出賣人排日領取保管證，使商人能如期取得付欺，意至善也。但商人於辦理保管時，填寫價目，覓保呈送，而棉業管理處方面，必須查核價目，計算價欺，騐對保人及分發存單，交換證等，種種手續，則第一次付欵期前，能否竣事，尙難預卜，應請從速趕辦，毋使商人失望。</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>青春（二）</p>
<p>「還是　二中的好呵！」</p>
<p>着新製的小食　，戴着　　的　角徽章的學生劃　。　田口隆夫·這樣結向眞入說着。</p>
<p>「那是自然啦！」</p>
<p>穿着間樣服裝的眞人，如同平常一般地，　　笑着。</p>
<p>二人。都很順利的進了縣立第二中學，為感謝神明，去參拜照　神社，荒田八　社。</p>
<p>二人並沒有虔誠的信仰。不過當地的風習，每當有事的時候。都要參拜　主的家廟，土地寺，然後拜祖先的墳墓。現在正走着囘家的路。</p>
<p>「大好的天氣啊！到海邊去玩一下吧！」</p>
<p>眞人仰視着强烈的陽光，臉上流着汗。那時天雖在四月三日的神武天皇祭，而櫻花都已經謝了。</p>
<p>「不，今天不到我們家去嗎！我母親他們等着呢？」</p>
<p>隆夫想起了出來時母親購的話。她正準備着中飯，慶祝兒子和親友的入學。</p>
<p>「去也好，和你家人在一起，我覺得很拘束。」</p>
<p>眞人似乎很　　。終於在不和家族會面的條件下，他答應了　待。</p>
<p>雖然沒有見　海，但從那方面吹來的爾風，從正面吹拂過來。二人向下荒田的住宅區大踏步走去。</p>
<p>「我總想　海軍。」</p>
<p>夫　高氣揚地说着　來的志顔。還祗進入中學，已經做着兵學校入學試聽的夢了。</p>
<p>他從小學五年級那時起，已　熟中於海軍。就　那　田，所以他進中學時，本想還　立一中。一中是秀才會來的學校，從一中畢業，進入高等師範學校，海軍兵學校，　軍士官學校的入學　很高。拘　校制的白色裏的一中學生的　　，成為少年們羡慕的目標。同時說起二中，有似頑皮兒童的收容所。最近自從東京學習院的河田敎授新任校長以來，一般的批評雖似乎改變了，但還不及一中。隆夫捨氣了多年來所希　的一中，而進了入二中，也就因為不願和知己的眞人分離的緣故。二中的友誼是這樣的密切。</p>
<p>眞人呢，一中也好，二中也好，是無所謂的。不過聽了哥哥眞二郎的勸吿，過了二中。他祗要能夠進入中學，已覺得是望外了。（四吉兄長是不是中途輟學商業學校嗎）？那裏畢業後，是否再進高一級的學校，還是個疑問。母親已經五十六歲了。見到那　夜不息的勞苦樣子，眞想能夠早一天到社會上去做事，減輕負担。</p>
<p>不知不覺間，二人已走到　田口的門前　。</p>

<h3>Combating Smuggling and Eliminating the Black Market</h3>
<p>The Rice and Grain Control Committee was established amidst the enthusiastic anticipation of the citizens and the urgent needs of the objective environment. It was in preparation since the end of August, lasting a full month. Having been established not quite four months ago, with over 270 internal staff and nearly a thousand in other locations, spending tens of millions of dollars, how are the achievements of the committee so far? What contributions has it made to the people's food supply? We are willing to conduct a faithful and objective review to discuss it with the committee and the public.</p>
<p>On September 8th, Chairman Yuan told a reporter from the New China Daily: "The procurement of rice and grain is originally an extremely difficult task. Regardless of the past performance of the United Rice and Grain Cooperative, we should reform it from now on. I will, based on the principle of serving the society and benefiting the people, lead my colleagues to work together on this important issue of people's livelihood, so that our citizens will have no worry about food, to live up to the earnest expectations of the citizens."</p>
<p>On October 9th, Chairman Yuan said: "...If we want the control to succeed, personnel issues are also extremely important. The rice and grain control is still in its infancy, and we should establish a good reputation and set an example. As the leader, I must strictly supervise all staff to eliminate corruption and maintain integrity. I also hope that people in society will pay attention and report any issues at any time, so that we can listen to all sides and complete our mission."</p>
<p>On November 6th, the New China Daily reported, according to the Rice Control Committee, each rice district can find ways to transport 270,000 bags of rice to Shanghai each month, which is double the 150,000 bags per month by the previous United Rice and Grain Cooperative. Rationing per household can hopefully increase to between two and two and a half liters per month.</p>
<p>On November 26th, the Central News Agency reported that the procurement work is progressing smoothly. The rice and grain collected by the committee's procurement merchants in various regions has reached a considerable amount and will soon be transported to Shanghai in large quantities to relieve the people's food shortage.</p>
<p>On November 27th, the Central News Agency reported that the Rice Control Committee recently found that rice and grain smuggling in the two urban districts is becoming increasingly rampant, affecting the grain policy. In addition to instructing its offices in various regions to strengthen control and procurement, it has also requested the assistance of the municipal police to crack down on smuggling in order to protect the grain policy.</p>
<p>On December 8th, it was reported that the Grain Control Committee is actively procuring rice. A large amount of rice and grain has been collected in various regions, but due to slight inconvenience in transportation, the rationing of rice per household in the city has been slightly delayed. After working hard to adjust, 100,000 dan of civilian rice has recently been transported, and it has been decided to use this rice for rationing to households. It is also heard that a large batch of rice is being transported to Shanghai in a continuous stream, and it is expected that it can be rationed by the head before the 20th.</p>
<p>The above excerpts are public news after the establishment of the Rice Control Committee. Some were released by the committee itself, and some were approved by the committee. In short, these are the credit guarantees that the Rice Control Committee provided to the public, and the public must demand that they be honored. Because the issue of people's food is important, it is by no means a child's play.</p>
<p>Now, we further review the work of the Rice Control Committee. Apart from other things, in terms of household rice rationing alone, only eight rations totaling eight liters have been provided in the past four months. Compared to expectations, the two shortcomings of "reduced quantity" and "missed deadlines" are already ironclad facts. Moreover, these rations were not directly handled by the Rice Control Committee, but were from previous reserves. All of these show that the Rice Control Committee has failed to honor its credit guarantees and failed to fulfill its responsibilities.</p>
<p>Controlled economy is still a pioneering undertaking in our country. Whether the promotion in the future is smooth or not depends entirely on the public's understanding and cooperation. To gain the public's understanding and cooperation, we must first establish the credibility of the controlled economy. Rice and grain control is the main livelihood item in the controlled economy, and it is particularly important to establish credibility. However, the impression that the Rice Control Committee has given to the public in the past four months is repeated breach of trust, the consequence of which is to weaken the effectiveness of promoting the controlled economy, and at the same time, the people's food is more seriously threatened.</p>
<p>Secondly, as the amount of household rice rationed becomes less and less, the price of black market rice becomes increasingly higher, currently reaching 2,450 yuan per stone. We cannot help but ask:</p>
<p>If the reduction in household rice rations is due to a shortage of rice and grain, where does the continuous supply of black market rice come from?</p>
<p>If the reduction in household rice rations is due to transportation difficulties, how can the black market rice come in?</p>
<p>Since rice and grain have been controlled, why is there still smuggling? Since rice and grain are rationed at official prices, why is there still a black market? With smuggling and a black market, who should the controller blame?</p>
<p>Since it cannot control procurement, crack down on smuggling, provide sufficient rations, or eliminate the black market, why does it passively delay matters, only causing suffering to the people's livelihood? How can it explain itself?</p>
<p>In conclusion, according to the current facts, there is no fear of rice and grain shortage, and transportation is not too difficult, because black market rice can come in continuously. The focus of the problem is the huge difference between the official price of household rice and the underground price of black market rice, so people are blinded by profit and are not on the right track. There are a lot of complaints about the Rice Control Committee issuing procurement certificates fraudulently, for example. Recently, staff of the Cotton Management Office of the Business Control Committee committed fraud. The committee immediately thoroughly investigated and severely punished them without any leniency, which is a very realistic example for the Rice Control Committee. I hope it will conduct a thorough investigation and severe punishment. At the same time, all levels of personnel of the Rice Control Committee must thoroughly self-discipline, promote the sense of responsibility for serving the people's food, and absolutely achieve no smuggling, no black market, sufficient rations, and on-time rations, otherwise, passively delaying matters and failing to act cannot allow the dereliction of duty of a few people to harm the lives of the public.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Garrison on Tarawa and Makin Islands Heroically Sacrificed Themselves, Fighting Bravely for Six Days and Inflicting Heavy Losses on the Superior Enemy Forces</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th, Central News Agency - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:15 PM on the 20th: The Imperial Marines defending Tarawa Island and Makin Island have, since November 21st, engaged the enemy landing forces of over 50,000 with only 3,000 troops, resisting the enemy's fierce bombing and naval gunfire. As a result of days of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy losses several times greater than ours, and restrained the enemy's powerful mobile units, making many contributions to the naval and air operations of our forces. On November 25th, they carried out a final charge, and the entire unit was honorably annihilated. The commander was Rear Admiral Keiji Shibasaki. In addition, approximately 1,500 military personnel who had cooperated with the garrison in defending the two islands were also honorably annihilated.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th, Central News Agency - Regarding the honorable annihilation of the Japanese Marines and military personnel defending Tarawa Island and Makin Island, the General Headquarters has announced that the Japanese forces honorably annihilated this time included 3,000 Marines and 1,500 military personnel engaged in facility management and other duties. The commander was Rear Admiral Keiji Shibasaki. "The Marines were widely known throughout the world for their heroic battles in Shanghai in 1932 and 1937, and now a glorious page has been added to their history. The great tasks completed by these Marines and military personnel on the front lines, and the impact on the overall war situation, are beyond description. Because the communication equipment was destroyed too early, the battle history of the garrisons on both islands cannot be fully known, but judging from the foreign news reports, it is clear that they fought bravely. This is a page in world war history that will be remembered forever. What we should pay particular attention to is the fact that 1,500 military personnel also fought alongside the Marines to the end and were honorably annihilated. So many military personnel were needed on the front-line islands in order to make these islands the first line of defense for protecting the Japanese mainland and preventing enemy invasion, so it was necessary to greatly strengthen the various facilities in the area. These military personnel cooperated with the troops in carrying out their missions at all times before their honorable annihilation. Remembering the words of Marshal Togo, 'Enemies coming from the sea should be defended against', the first line of island nation Japan is in the Pacific. The current situation is becoming increasingly tense, and it has reached the point of decisive battle and is entering a long-term war. At this time of decisive battle, following the 4,500 heroic spirits who were honorably annihilated is the way to win the long-term war. The 4,500 heroic spirits are also an alarm bell for the total struggle of 100 million Japanese people."</p>
<h3>Situation of Fierce Fighting by Japanese Marines</h3>
<p>Colonel Kurihara Broadcast Last Night</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th, Central News Agency - Colonel Eizo Kurihara, head of the Naval Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, broadcasted at 7:20 PM on the 20th on the situation of fierce fighting by the Japanese Marines and military personnel who cooperated in the operation of defending Tarawa and Makin Islands. The gist is revised as follows: The General Headquarters announced today that the 3,000 Marines and 1,500 military personnel defending Tarawa and Makin Islands have been fighting with all their might since November 19th, valiantly sacrificing themselves after heavily damaging the enemy forces of about 50,000 troops who attacked the Gilbert Islands, fully demonstrating the glorious tradition of the Navy. The United States, fearing that our country would increasingly strengthen the invincible and undefeated attitude established by the illustrious battle results in the war and the increasingly advanced great cause of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, recently shouted "Don't give Japan time" and launched a large-scale counterattack as soon as possible. For example, on November 1st, the enemy attempted to land on Bougainville Island in the Solomon Islands with many aircraft carriers and battleships. Our troops and air force immediately launched a counterattack upon receiving the report, repeatedly defeating the enemy forces in the sea near the island, sinking and destroying 11 enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, transport ships, etc., and shooting down 576 enemy aircraft. After the enemy's counterattack was frustrated in the Solomon Islands, they launched a powerful mobile unit (based on aircraft carriers and battleships) on November 19th to escort transport convoys to Tarawa and Makin Islands, our advanced bases in the Gilbert Islands. Our Marines immediately engaged them. On that day, approximately 900 enemy aircraft attacked Tarawa Island, dropping bombs like rain, so some of the defense facilities were destroyed.</p>
<p>The garrison troops suffered slight casualties, but the morale of the garrison troops became more vigorous. In the midst of heavy enemy bombing, they shot down 31 enemy aircraft. On the morning of the 20th, another 200 enemy aircraft bombed the island again and shelled the island with five battleships, cruisers, and destroyers for twelve hours. Our Marines immediately launched a counterattack, shooting down 23 enemy aircraft. At the same time, approximately 300 enemy aircraft attacked Makin Island, and the Marines on the island immediately repelled them, shooting down 12 enemy aircraft. At dawn on the 20th, the enemy approached the two islands with approximately 150 amphibious tanks and hundreds of landing craft and began landing, engaging in fierce ground combat with our guard troops. The enemy bombed and shelled the islands for two days, spending approximately 2,200 tons of artillery shells and 700 tons of bombs. The enemy thought that the resistance of our Marines had been exhausted, but our Marines, who were waiting for an opportunity, began firing when the enemy landing craft approached the shore, causing most of them to sink into the sea. The enemy forces were immediately thrown into chaos. The enemy's vanguard tank force was trapped by our solid tank trenches and heavy firepower positions, or caught fire and stalled, or was overturned by bullets. The enemy's landing craft were either blown to pieces or overturned in the sea. The enemy landing force was annihilated on the water's edge at that time, but the enemy relied on its large number of troops and sent additional reinforcements to attack, and at dawn, they dispatched a large number of fighters and bombers to bombard our military positions, causing the strength of our Marines to gradually weaken. Finally, the enemy landed in a corner of the island, but the morale of our army became even more vigorous. According to the official report on the 21st, after fierce fighting, although our army suffered considerable losses, it still drove more than 5,000 landing enemy troops to the coast and planned to encircle and annihilate them from three sides in the evening. Since the 19th, our army had been fighting continuously, sleepless and without food or drink for days, so the enemy army suffered heavy losses after the fierce attack by the Japanese Marines on the night of the 21st and did not dare to land for a while, but the enemy army finally saw through that our army was outnumbered and transferred a large number of reinforcements, beginning to land on the morning of the 22nd, attempting to resolve our Marines in one fell swoop, but our army had made up its mind to defend to the death, and under the enemy's heavy bombing and shelling, they resisted the large enemy forces with few troops and did not retreat an inch. According to the report at 1:00 PM that day, "The battle situation has not changed." However, after this telegram was sent, communication between Tarawa Island and Makin Island was interrupted because the wireless telegraph machine was destroyed, so the situation of the fierce fighting of the Japanese Marines on the national islands could not be known afterwards. However, according to the reconnaissance by friendly aircraft cooperating in the operation and the enemy's announcement, it can be inferred that the general situation is as follows: The members of our Marines received the Emperor's decree in the late night of the 22nd,</p>
<p>The entire team became more courageous.</p>
<p>According to the reconnaissance of the friendly aircraft sent to rescue on the 23rd, it was confirmed that our army was firmly defending the position of the previous day and had not retreated a step, but the army and combat team felt that the strength was becoming weaker and weaker, and the enemy army was constantly deploying new troops to land, so our commander Major General Shibasaki saw this urgent situation and personally led his troops into the enemy's position. The US Navy authorities also said, "The Tarawa Island operation was the greatest sacrifice made by the US military since the start of the war. The number of deaths in such a short period of time is unprecedented in the history of war." At that time, naval air squadrons and submarine units also attacked the enemy's aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and other enemy ships at sea, because the enemy army attempted to capture Tarawa Island and Makin Island in one fell swoop. After several attacks, 11 enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and other ships were sunk, resulting in great victories. The 3,000 soldiers of our Marines on Tarawa and Makin Islands were trapped on a lonely island in the Pacific Ocean, fighting against the enemy's 50,000 troops, heavily damaging the enemy forces, and stubbornly defending the two islands until the last soldier. Taking advantage of the enemy's carelessness, they achieved brilliant battle results. Even the United States, which is known for its strong productivity, has suffered a major blow and cannot recover in a long time. The 3,000 soldiers of our Marines shed blood on the coral reefs under the equator, making great sacrifices and enabling our entire army to carry out powerful operations. This is truly worthy of praise. Commander Major General Shibasaki served as the Chief of Staff of the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force for a year and a half. He was particularly brave and decisive in land combat, was extremely sensitive to opportunities, and always took the lead in facing difficulties, fulfilling his ambition to share the joys and sorrows with his subordinates. He was a typical military commander. Now the enemy, the United Kingdom and the United States, are launching a counterattack against us with all their strength, but the countless islands in the Pacific Ocean are our army's advanced bases, and together with our naval forces, they form</p>
<p>An Iron Wall of Defense.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the garrison are determined to die. The enemy, the United Kingdom and the United States, rely on their abundant resources and huge production capacity to carry out counterattacks steadily, but in front of our army, they will ultimately be in vain.</p>

<h3>Japan Faces a Critical Period, Determined to Promote Strong Politics. The 84th Session of Parliament is Scheduled to Convene on Friday.</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th, Central News Agency - The 84th regular session of the Japanese Parliament is scheduled to convene as scheduled on the 24th of this month. The government has prepared the budget bill to be submitted to this parliament, and the Political Affairs Association is also conducting meticulous investigations. The government, during this critical period, has decided to make consolidating political power the only important task, concentrating the labor of all aspects of the country, and promoting decisive politics. The parliament's main task is to stimulate the people's strong fighting spirit and adhere to the attitude of supporting the government. The main issues of this parliament will be to enhance the belief in victory and strengthen productivity measures. In his policy speech at this parliament, Prime Minister Tojo will explain the battle situation in Bougainville Island, Gilbert Island, Burma, and China, as well as the war situation in Europe, and frankly state the magnificent operations of the Japanese army and the future trend, in order to arouse the people to rise up unanimously. He will also elaborate on the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere centered on the Greater East Asia Conference. The government will also take this opportunity to announce to the people to work hard to achieve the above goals. In addition, issues such as increasing the production of aircraft and ships and securing food will also become the central issues of this parliament. Various meticulous plans will also be made regarding the decisive tax increase bill to be submitted to this parliament. It is foreseeable that a historically significant great statement will be made during this parliament. It is expected that a considerable number of questioners will also be present in this parliament to question the policy speech. In every parliament, there is the issue of shortening the deliberation time. Rather than shortening the time, it is better to focus the discussion on key points, and some say that extending the session is harmless. The long-term convening of the parliament is because the Japanese government and the parliament are completely connected as one. Under this circumstance, it can enhance the effect. There are also many who advocate that the parliament should be fully utilized as one wing of the decisive system. This truly implies the characteristics of this parliament.</p>
<h3>US Violates International Law: Blindly Bombs Hospital Ship, Japan Lodges Strong Protest</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's intensification of the war has led to repeated illegal acts. Since the naval hospital ship Takasago Maru was illegally attacked by an enemy submarine on April 26th of last year, there have been as many as eleven incidents of enemy submarines and aircraft attacking Japanese naval hospital ships. Japan has twice lodged strong protests with the enemy through its protecting power, demanding that the enemy reflect on its actions and warning them to exercise caution in the future. However, the enemy not only disregarded these protests, but also, at 8:10 AM on November 27th, illegally bombed the Japanese military hospital ship Buenos Aires Maru with a single B-24 Liberator aircraft in the sea 200 kilometers north of Kavieng, New Ireland, sinking the ship. Despite strenuous rescue efforts by the Japanese military, the dead, injured, and missing still numbered as many as 174 (including wounded soldiers being transported to the rear, medical personnel, nurses, and crew). The enemy aircraft, ignoring the clear Red Cross markings, even strafed lifeboats and survivors with machine guns. Afterwards, the Japanese side conducted a detailed investigation of the survivors and the circumstances of the incident. Only recently has the truth been ascertained. Now, the enemy's illegal behavior can no longer be concealed, and Japanese officials and citizens are exceptionally indignant. The head of the Army Press Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters also pointed out these facts in a speech on December 10th, strongly denouncing the enemy's illegal actions. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has decided to formally lodge a protest, detailing the truth of the incident as determined by Japanese investigation, pursuing the enemy's responsibility, and demanding guarantees that similar incidents will not occur in the future. If the enemy does not take sincere measures, Japan will also take decisive action. The protest has been delivered to the United States by Spain, Japan's protecting power. All procedures have been completed by the Japanese Minister to Spain, Suma.</p>
<p>Contents of the Protest</p>
<p>After releasing a statement on the 20th, the Japanese diplomatic authorities also published the protest as follows: The Imperial hospital ship Buenos Aires Maru, while sailing at 8:10 AM on November 27th at 2 degrees 40 minutes south latitude and 149 degrees 20 minutes east longitude, was suddenly attacked by a single B-24 Liberator aircraft of the American military, which dropped bombs, and sank approximately 40 minutes later. The aircraft approached the ship's stern from the direction opposite the sun at an altitude of approximately 1,000 meters, dropped one bomb, and then disappeared into the clouds ahead. After the ship was attacked, approximately eighteen lifeboats and small motorboats were immediately launched. Almost all of the wounded, sick, and other passengers were rescued onto lifeboats or rafts before the ship sank. However, approximately thirty severely wounded and sick soldiers and other personnel in the No. 4 hold were crushed to death or injured by the hatch beams that fell due to the bombing and sank with the ship. The communication equipment of the boats filled with the wounded and sick soldiers was destroyed, making it impossible to communicate. While drifting at sea from November 27th to December 2nd, they were repeatedly spotted by American patrol aircraft. Each time they were spotted, a Red Cross was made of red cloth and placed in the center of the boat as a marking. The patrol aircraft also recognized these markings at low altitude. However, on December 1st, a patrol aircraft strafed a drifting boat filled with wounded and sick soldiers at an extremely low altitude of about 100 meters, resulting in two deaths and one injury. Finally, on the afternoon of December 2nd, some of the drifting boats spotted an Imperial ship sailing nearby. Based on its report, Imperial aircraft and boats completely rescued the remaining survivors between the 2nd and 3rd, resulting in a total of 174 deaths and missing, including nurses. When the Hague Convention was concluded in 1907, it stipulated that the principles of the Geneva Convention should apply to naval warfare. In accordance with Article 1 of that treaty, the Japanese government notified the United States government of the name of the Buenos Aires Maru through its protecting power, the Spanish government, on December 7th of last year. In addition to the legally required markings under Article 5 of the treaty, it was also equipped with specially made easily recognizable aerial and nighttime Red Cross markings researched by the Imperial military authorities, which had also been notified to the United States government. Furthermore, at the time of the incident, the weather was clear, the sun was at the aircraft's back, and the aircraft was flying at an altitude of approximately 1,000 meters, making these markings fully visible. The American aircraft's blind bombing was not only a deliberate violation of the Hague Convention and the fundamental principles of international law but was also inhumane. Moreover, it caused the tragic death of innocent nurses and strafed wounded and sick soldiers drifting in the water. This can truly be described as a barbaric and despicable act of murder. Regarding this incident, the Imperial government has lodged a strong protest with the United States government, urging it to reflect on its actions so that the United States government can conduct a thorough investigation of the truth in good faith and respond accordingly, punish those responsible, guarantee that such incidents will not occur in the future, and also declared that it reserves all rights to rectify this illegal act. The Imperial government had previously lodged a strong protest with the United States government through its protecting power, Spain, on June 28th due to the illegal attacks on six hospital ships, including the Arab Maru, but has not yet received a reply. Since then, such illegal attacks have continued to occur. Recently, the attacks on four hospital ships, including the Takasago Maru, were also communicated to the United States government through its protecting power. Now, the sinking of the Buenos Aires Maru has occurred again, so the Imperial government is once again carefully calling the United States government's deep attention.</p>
<p>Colonel Oshio Issues Statement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese government announced its protest against the American bombing and sinking of the Japanese hospital ship, the entire nation has been filled with deep grief and indignation. Recalling the beginning of the war, the Japanese Navy attacked all warships and vessels within Pearl Harbor, sinking or damaging them, but did not attack enemy hospital ships. This spirit of Bushido on the part of Japan caused the local Japanese residents to weep with emotion. However, the United States and Britain have repeatedly attacked Japanese hospital ships in return, which is truly outrageous to both gods and men. Furthermore, Air Force personnel reported sinking a fleet of excellent Japanese transport ships, and at the same time, the American authorities included it in their war record in order to deceive the people. The shamelessness of the world is truly unsurpassed in this case. Now, Colonel Oshio, a key figure at the Japanese Red Cross Hospital, has issued a special statement on this matter, saying in brief, "The enemy's illegal behavior is truly unexpected. We, the 100 million people of Japan, can only further strengthen our resolve to destroy the American enemy. The United States has destroyed the Red Cross Law and is not ashamed of it, having removed its mask of humanity and revealed its barbaric form. In reality, they are suffering from frustration due to repeated defeats. The spiritual battle line of the United States and Britain has been broken through by Japan. We are determined to pursue world peace, regardless of right or wrong, and persist in our determination to fight the United States."</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Burma Border Adopts Encirclement Tactics, Enemy's Counterattack Artery Severed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Burmese front, the Japanese army on the Burmese front launched a fierce attack on the Indian 38th New Division of the Chongqing forces in the Fuguai area and the Allied forces in the Hammie area from late October, defeating them everywhere and achieving significant battle results. Judging from the enemy's movements, it can be seen that after their defeat in the Nujiang operation and the loss of key strongholds for retaking Burma, they are obviously trying to find a second stronghold. Therefore, since late October, they have been very active in the Fuguai area. At the same time, the American Air Force stationed in India has also strengthened its strength, reinforcing military facilities around the Tinsukia airfield and relying on air transport routes to vigorously transport important military supplies. The Chongqing forces placed on the front line, threatened by the Japanese army's attack on India, have seen deserters. The 112th and 114th Regiments of the 38th New Division of the Indian forces, using the motor road that runs through Ledo-Tagap Ga, crossed the border line, the Patkai Mountains, and gathered in Tagap Ga. Using this as a dividing point, part of the force infiltrated the west bank area of the upper reaches of the Talun Der River, engaging in suspicious activities along various aspects of the riverbank. The main force is active in front of Xinburo. Another part of the force is observing opportunities for counterattack in Tamin. In late November, the 38th Division deployed the 113th Regiment to the dividing point, and transferred the main force of the 22nd New Division south from Ledo, using it as a reserve force, and moved the Allied forces headquarters, located approximately 300 kilometers northwest of Calcutta, to the Ledo area, gradually adopting an offensive posture. As for the Japanese army, it overcame all unfavorable conditions and implemented encirclement tactics in the area, or took advantage of the enemy's weakness to cut off the enemy's counterattack artery, increasing the offensive posture toward Hammie. At that time, did the Japanese army's aircraft attacks on the Tinsukia airfield, which achieved glorious battle results, cause the military in that area to be greatly frightened? At the same time, the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing also suffered great damage and threats, and was further fiercely attacked by Japanese ground troops. Therefore, the enemy forces on the Burmese-Indian border are in a state of chaos. If they do not retreat, they risk being annihilated.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Continue in Finschhafen and Bougainville Island</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, fierce battles continue in the Finschhafen area of New Guinea. On the north bank of the Zongu River, a superior enemy force with six or seven tanks came to attack. The Japanese tank force immediately counterattacked, achieving the following battle results: A Japanese sergeant led two soldiers to infiltrate the enemy's position at 2:00 AM on the 13th, destroying one mortar, one machine gun, and one tent (containing ten enemy soldiers). Furthermore, a Japanese private first class led a close-quarters combat team of three soldiers to attack the enemy tanks that came to attack at 6:00 AM on the 13th, destroying the enemy's lead tank and preventing other tanks from advancing. At 11:00 AM on the 14th, they attacked the right flank of the enemy force that was advancing, destroying one enemy machine gun and killing twenty enemy soldiers. One Japanese soldier was injured.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, on December 12th, a Japanese army maritime transport unit engaged three large enemy torpedo boats near Finschhafen, New Guinea, and repelled them. In this engagement, one enemy boat caught fire, and one was hit. There were no Japanese losses.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific states: The Japanese army is engaged in fierce battles at Torokina Point on Bougainville Island. From the 7th to the 11th of this month, the battle results obtained near Bibaia, seven kilometers northeast of the point, are as follows: 178 American corpses were left behind. The Japanese army seized one heavy machine gun, eight light machine guns, nineteen pistols, and 1,400 rounds of ammunition.</p>
<h3>Director Shi Receives Reporters, Explains Work Overview, Striving for Increased Production</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday hosted Chinese and foreign reporters, with Vice Minister Zuo Xuan receiving them on behalf of the Minister. The details are recorded below: It has been three months since Minister Chen took office. We have implemented controls over materials and set prices. We are conducting investigations into agriculture, industry, commerce, and mining. Production management zones have been established in Nanjing, Shanghai, and northern Jiangsu. This year, we plan to promote more than 1,200 strains of cotton seeds and expand cotton fields by more than 11,000 mu. The twelve Lin Sheng demonstration farms originally established by the Ministry can gradually enter the path of economic farms. To commemorate the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation next year, we will plant 1.4 million trees near Zijin Mountain in the suburbs of Nanjing. After the dissolution of the Central China Sericulture Company, we are formulating plans to create sericulture-related businesses. Military-affiliated factories that have been taken over in the past have been returned to the original owners for operation. In order to increase production today, we are bravely manufacturing essential industrial goods and finding ways to solve problems. The supervision of industrial and commercial organizations, the smooth allocation of materials, and the curbing of rising prices should all be properly handled. The trend of increasing capital in companies and factories has been extremely strong for a time. The Ministry is formulating measures to restrict capital increases and ensure that funds are used for legitimate purposes. The insurance company's capital increase plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and will be announced and implemented as soon as it is approved. The fuel problem is becoming increasingly serious, and increasing coal production is an urgent task. Tou Shan Coal Mine Company produces 25 to 30 tons of coal per day, and after January next year, it will be able to produce about 100 to 150 tons per day. The coal reserves of Anhui Lieshan Coal Mine Company and Zhejiang Changxing Coal Mine Company are extremely rich, and development plans have been formulated and preparations are underway. Approximately 32 large mining areas, covering an area of approximately 200,000 hectares, have been approved and licensed for private mining operations. In the future, the Ministry's work will focus on increasing production and stabilizing people's livelihoods within its jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Rural Affairs Bureau Begins Operations</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Guangdong Provincial Government previously established the Guangdong Rural Affairs Bureau in order to establish security in the Guangdong region and increase production. The bureau has already begun operations on the 17th and has been formally established, but still awaits the arrival of spring. The bureau is the central organization for guiding rural work. Basic organizations for security and construction will soon be established, and efforts will begin to advance toward establishing security, increasing production, and completing construction.</p>
<h3>Beijing Correspondence: The Publishing Industry in North China</h3>
<p>The modern news industry bears the responsibility of propaganda, and each era has its own propaganda guidelines and policies, which are closely related to the political situation at the time. The North China News Association held its second chief editors' meeting on the 3rd of this month at the Beijing Hotel to discuss these guidelines and policies. More than 40 chief editors from newspapers and magazines attended this meeting. In the morning, Mr. Yang Dachuo, chairman of the Editorial Committee, presided over the meeting and delivered an opening speech. Speeches were also given by Guan Yixian, chairman of the board of directors, Kawasaki Yoshio, director of the Research Section of the Japanese Embassy, and Kato, director of the Press Department. After lunch, the formal meeting resumed. The chairman reported on the association's affairs, and then the agenda items were discussed.

<p>Controlling the Cotton Textile Industry</p>
<p>North China is a cotton-producing area. However, due to the relationship between cotton and the military industry, the price of cotton fabrics has risen to unimaginable levels. A foot of ordinary white or blue cloth now sells for more than five yuan in legal tender. The general public is unable to purchase it, resulting in a phenomenon where broken cotton, old cotton, and other mixed cotton are selling very well. The impact of this is that the listing of raw cotton is greatly hindered. Therefore, the North China Textile Industry Association has decided to place all cotton textile manufacturers and their trading partners, the mixed cotton processors, under the control of the association. Recently, it has also prepared a control outline to integrate all cotton textile factories in North China into five cotton textile groups: Beijing Area Cotton Textile Group, Tianjin Area Cotton Textile Group, Jinan Area Cotton Textile Group, Qingdao Area Cotton Textile Group, and Shimen Area Cotton Textile Group. These cotton textile groups are in the process of being organized and are expected to be completed in the middle of this month. As for the allocation of raw cotton, it has been decided to establish production plans for each period and allocate it to the cotton textile groups accordingly. The groups will then allocate it to their members. In addition, it is stipulated that mixed cotton processors must obtain permission from the Textile Industry Association to purchase mixed cotton and conduct external transactions. This is also a method of controlled economy in a time of war.</p>
<p>Punishing Illegal Merchants</p>
<p>This spring, partly due to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, grain prices soared like runaway horses, causing people to starve to death everywhere in Beijing. The North China authorities made every effort to overcome this difficulty, and the Nanjing government also passed a law to punish unscrupulous merchants with military law. At the end of June, the North China authorities also vigorously investigated unscrupulous merchants, and a considerable number of them were "caught and sent to the authorities." Recently, the North China authorities publicly announced all the cases that have been handled, stating that a total of 61 people were sentenced to seven years of imprisonment or less, 43 people were fined 700,000 yuan or less, and 78 companies were fined 8 million yuan or less. Economic saboteurs and illegal merchants have finally been severely punished. (From Man, December 12!)</p>

<h3>Japanese Invent Magnesium Hydroxide Manufacturing Method</h3>
<p>Metallic "magnesium metal" is an important material for manufacturing aircraft. Now, a certain Japanese magnesium manufacturing factory has invented a "magnesium hydroxide manufacturing method" for extracting it from seawater, which can be extracted from seawater without relying on alkali, in order to meet the needs of mass production of aircraft. The United States is also researching this magnesium hydroxide manufacturing method. A certain Japanese magnesium manufacturing factory, in view of the large demand for magnesium, began practical research last year. However, because there were many difficulties in actual manufacturing, it took a year to move from the experimental stage to the formal growth stage. As soon as the construction of the factory is completed, mass production will begin immediately. It is said that one cubic meter of seawater contains about one gram of magnesium. The factory's seawater treatment capacity, special large tanks, and sedimentation tanks have also been strengthened, so its future increase in production is truly promising.</p>

<h3>British Army in Eastern Italy Fires 20,000 Shells, German Defense Line Remains Unshaken</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: War activities in the Apennine Mountains and the coastal areas of eastern Italy are only of a local nature. The American imperial army, with the strength of one regiment, advanced along the highway from Orsogna to Ortona, making a reckless attack. This situation is also of a local nature. General Montgomery attempted to break through here a few days ago, but failed. Now, this regiment has also suffered a heavy defeat. Although the British army opened fire on a narrow area with extremely fierce artillery fire, firing at least 22,000 shells, the result was that it failed to open any gaps for the British infantry. Another noteworthy military action was that several strong British army commando units along the coast were intercepted and repulsed by the German army.

<h3>The Darling of the Skies: Wooden Airplanes</h3>
<p>Since the advent of radio detection devices, the nature of aerial warfare has undergone a transformation. To counter this modern weapon, wooden airplanes have emerged. These wooden airplanes are made of "reinforced wood." Manufacturing this reinforced wood requires pressing machinery, which the Japanese government has recently requested all owners throughout the country to contribute. It is truly intriguing that manufacturing airplanes from wood requires pressing machinery used to extract oil from rice bran, soybeans, peanuts, rapeseed, and the like.</p>
<p>However, this type of machinery is also crucial in the food industry, so the Ministry of Munitions is quite cautious about requesting its contribution. Mr. Yozo Yokoo, a farmer from Yono, Saitama Prefecture, heard about this and, on November 25th, visited Mr. Endo, the Director-General of the Aeronautical Weapons Bureau of the Ministry of Munitions, to offer three excellent pressing machines used in his facility for airplane production, stating, "If necessary, you don't have to wait for slow business arrangements; please use them immediately." The Director-General was deeply moved by this selfless offer, saying, "The spirit of personally requesting to contribute what the military authorities deem necessary is what creates true Japanese fighting power." He then discussed the future darling of the skies, wooden airplanes, and their production as follows:</p>
<p>Wooden Airplanes Have a Long History</p>
<p>"Speaking of manufacturing airplanes from wood is nothing new; it has been done before. In the fifteenth year of the Taisho era [1926], when I was a captain, I was sent to Europe to gather preliminary knowledge about the state of the Japanese aircraft industry. I inspected a certain factory in Nagoya. At that time, they were inspecting a board as large as a table. If there was even one knot in the board, it was rejected. It was rare to find a three-by-six-foot board without knots, which made mass production impossible. What if we made it from metal?" He then laughed and said, "The military might only know about war and not about science. Metal is heavy and cannot fly..." The following year, I went to Europe and saw that Germany and France were using metal, which is why we now have active metal airplanes. However, metal has drawbacks. Due to the new weapon of ultra-shortwave radar, they are detected before reaching their destination, making the element of surprise, which is vital to airplanes, quite difficult. Thus, we researched wooden airplanes that could avoid detection. We cut the wood into thin sheets, overlapping the grains in alternating directions, and gluing them together with resin. We then compressed them with a pressing machine to create reinforced wood as strong as metal. We use this to manufacture airplanes. These airplanes are not being manufactured because of a shortage of airplanes but because of tactical requirements. (Pressing machines are necessary when manufacturing reinforced wood.)"</p>
<p>He later discussed wooden airplanes in various countries.</p>
<p>"The best wood must have the strength and flexibility of metal, able to bend without breaking. Britain has even created Mosquito-type twin-engine bomber aircraft, which have appeared in the Burma region. They may have been used in the bombing of Berlin this time. The United States also has them. Japan is gradually catching up, manufacturing propellers, fuselages, wings—everything."</p>
<p>At this point, he shifted his focus to hopes for contributors and airplane factories.</p>
<p>Production is Limitless</p>
<p>"We in the Ministry of Munitions do not believe in the so-called limits of production. From all perspectives, if we focus and dedicate ourselves to it, there is nothing we cannot achieve. The issues of fuel, manpower, and wages are all the same. Many people say that things that are unprofitable cannot be achieved even with full effort, and that spirit alone cannot succeed. Even in the aircraft industry, many people cannot shake off money-worship when it comes to decisive battles. What the world's science cannot match are Japanese temples and Shinto shrines, such as the Ise Grand Shrine. They are flawless buildings, which the whole world has acknowledged. But these buildings were all created by the spirit of Japanese people without any thought of money. If we use this spirit to manufacture all weapons, we can certainly surpass Britain and America in quality and quantity. What the front-line soldiers need most now is weapons, but spirit is especially essential. I came from the artillery corps, and I was taught, and taught others, about names, death, shame, and cannons. Seeing the patriotic soldiers in Malaya and other seas, who blow themselves up with their airplanes and perish with their crew and ships as soon as the guns are ready to fire, and the spirit of naval officers who love their weapons, those working in munitions factories will naturally understand that they must work every day. Since the air battles of Bougainville Island, aircraft production has gradually increased. Whether there are battle results or not, we must continue to do so. I hope that those involved will further exert themselves. I also hope that those who contribute pressing machines will quickly contribute their excellent machinery currently in use for increased aircraft production." (From the Daily News, November 27th)</p>

<h3>Measures for Requisitioning Vehicles in Case of Air Raids or Emergencies Announced Yesterday by the Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Shanghai Special Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters issued an announcement yesterday stating: "It is hereby announced that in the event of air raids or other emergencies in the city, all vehicles, except those owned by the government, may be requisitioned by this Headquarters to deal with the situation. The duration of requisition will be determined based on the needs of the situation.</p>
<p>Steam Boiler Handling Measures</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the event of an air raid, steam boilers should be handled with great care. The measures for doing so have also been stipulated as follows: Whenever an air raid or emergency occurs, all boiler steam pipes, if still under steam pressure and with coal fire in the furnace, should be properly attended to by someone. If the person attending to the boiler must temporarily evacuate due to an emergency, the coal fire in the furnace must be completely extinguished, and water should be poured into the boiler, with the water level higher than normal. If the pressure in the boiler steam pipes rises above normal due to the shutdown of steam machinery, the boiler safety valve must be opened, or the exhaust pipe tightened, to release steam or use other appropriate methods to reduce steam pressure."</p>

<h3>Business and Industry Association Hosts Farewell Tea Party for Mr. Komuro of Japan Yesterday's Grand Tea Party</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Mr. Takeo Komuro, Chairman of the Shanghai Business and Industry Association, is currently the General Manager of Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. in Shanghai and has also served as the Deputy Director-General of the former Shanghai Municipal Council for many years. He has made many contributions to the welfare of the citizens and the economic sector of Shanghai, and he has especially contributed to the promotion of close cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese business and industry sectors. The establishment of the Shanghai Business and Industry Association, enabling the united efforts of business and industry figures from both countries to engage in cooperative endeavors for the Greater East Asia War, owes much to Mr. Komuro's efforts. Recently, Mr. Komuro was ordered to return to his country with honors and will reportedly assume an important position in the Tokyo headquarters of Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. He will soon leave Shanghai. To express their farewell, the Chinese and Japanese members of the Business and Industry Association held a grand tea party yesterday at 5:00 PM in the conference hall of the Asia Building.</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>In addition to Chairman Takeo Komuro, who was invited to attend, Deputy Chairman Wen Lanting and Chinese members Lin Kanghou, Shi Fudeng, Chen Shaoma, Chen Binru, Guo Shun, Wang Boyuan, Jin Zongcheng, Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Nanping, Zheng Hongyan, and Allied members Takeuchi, Kurimoto, Washio, Tsutomu, Yamanaka, and guest President Takashima, among others, totaling over sixty individuals, were present. During the event, Deputy Chairman Wen Lanting delivered a farewell speech, followed by a thank-you speech by Chairman Komuro. The association then presented Mr. Komuro with a large silver cup, presented by Wen Lanting and Chen Binru on behalf of the association. Finally, everyone enjoyed tea and refreshments, and the event concluded with a group photo.</p>
<p>Mr. Wen's Speech</p>
<p>Deputy Chairman Wen Lanting said: "Mr. Komuro and fellow gentlemen, today we are holding this tea party to bid farewell to Mr. Takeo Komuro, the Chairman of our association, as Mr. Komuro will soon return to Tokyo with honors to assume an important position in the headquarters of Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. He will soon leave Shanghai. The establishment of this association entirely relied on Mr. Komuro's strong support, leading to its current scale. Before the recovery of the concessions, Mr. Komuro was the Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council and devoted much effort to the return of the concessions. Now that he is leaving Shanghai, not only will this association lose a guide, but the business and industry sector of this city will also lose a wise leader. I hope that after Mr. Komuro returns with honors, he will not forget us in the distance and will continue to provide guidance from time to time so that we may have something to follow. Today, we are presenting him with a silver cup as a keepsake and wish Mr. Komuro a boundless future."</p>
<p>Mr. Komuro's Reply</p>
<p>Mr. Komuro briefly replied: "I am deeply grateful for the grand banquet you have held today and express my sincere thanks. I am even more deeply moved by the sincere speech just delivered by Mr. Wen Lanting. Over the past two years, I have received your generous guidance and enthusiastic assistance, which has allowed my work to develop smoothly. I must express my gratitude on this occasion. This time, I have been ordered to return to my country, and I will constantly think of your enthusiasm and am reluctant to leave. I hope you will continue to provide guidance so that my future work can also unfold smoothly. I wish you all good health and extend my sincere thanks."</p>
<h3>Unified Vehicle Licenses to be Implemented Starting Next Year</h3>
<p>Since the recovery of the two concessions, the administration of this city has been unified, and the licenses for all types of vehicles should also be unified. Previously, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities convened a joint meeting with the Finance Departments of the First and Eighth District Offices and the First Police Administrative Department to discuss the unification of vehicle licenses. According to reporters' inquiries, after several consultations, the results were quite satisfactory, and it was decided that starting next year, the licenses for all types of military vehicles would be unified. The design has also been decided. The size will still be the same as the previous vehicle licenses, but on the left side, there will be a circular "沪" (Hu, short for Shanghai) character, followed by the number. Public and private vehicles will still be distinguished by black and white colors. As for the license application procedure, vehicle owners should still apply for licenses from the authorities in charge of their place of residence.</p>
<h3>Huashan Branch Designated as a Model Police District</h3>

<h3>Teenagers and Students Respond to the Campaign to Ban Smoking and Gambling</h3>
<p>Representatives Petition the Municipal Government</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Following the launch of a campaign to ban smoking, gambling, and dance halls by teenagers and students in the capital, teenagers and students in this city immediately responded. They believe that the harm of smoking and gambling is worse than that of poisonous snakes and fierce beasts. If they are not eliminated, the nation will not be able to embark on the road to revival. Dance halls are dens of extravagance and indulgence, violating the principles of thrift and hindering the development of the national spirit. Therefore, yesterday, teenagers and students from various districts of Shanghai issued telegrams and declarations, organized propaganda teams, and went to gambling dens and public places to conduct guidance and propaganda. They also sent representatives to the Municipal Government and the New Life Movement branch to request the complete banning of smoking, gambling, and dance halls to eliminate the harm and ensure the well-being of the people.</p>
<h3>Seventh Period Household Oil Sales End Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Passengers at the North Station Must Queue to Buy Tickets</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Times reports: According to informed sources, the North Railway Station has recently made great improvements in its treatment of passengers. The most important of these is a newly promulgated rule prohibiting the sale of tickets in the station, thereby strictly controlling the activities of ticket scalpers. In the past, this created a black market for tickets. Every day, large numbers of passengers went to the interior from the North Station. Because they were unwilling to be squeezed while buying tickets, they bought them from these scalpers at black market prices. According to the new regulations, passengers must queue up in order to buy tickets, which not only avoids congestion but also increases the speed of ticket sales. The black market for tickets will naturally disappear. The phenomenon of passengers rushing to board the train to grab seats has also disappeared, as they must now also queue up to board the train. The authorities have now dispatched special personnel to monitor the implementation of these new measures.</p>
<h3>First District Spring Property Tax Should be Paid Directly</h3>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Investigation of Essential Goods</h3>
<p>Because the Material Investigation Committee has observed a resurgence of rampant phenomena in the city's material resources, it plans to request the Executive Yuan to promptly conduct an investigation into essential goods for the people's livelihood, hoping to curb and stabilize prices. Furthermore, the local authorities of this city, noting that the prices of all goods have been raised by an average of eighty to ninety percent in the recent month, have convened symposiums with various industries to study how to stabilize the prices of various goods in order to understand the truth. From all of this, it can be seen that the severity of commodity prices in this city is increasing daily and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>In just a week, prices can be raised by an average of eighty to ninety percent. In contrast, considering the neighboring country of Japan, which has adopted a rationing system for daily necessities for nearly two years and where prices have not changed, the difference is truly like heaven and earth. No wonder Mr. Toyoshima, a famous Japanese writer who visited China not long ago, was greatly astonished by the prices displayed everywhere in Shanghai. We believe that the fundamental issue of price policy cannot be solved by piecemeal work. The key to investigating essential goods lies not only in thoroughly investigating speculative manipulation but also in studying the root causes of shortages. Therefore, how to increase the source of materials and how to facilitate the transportation of materials are the most fundamental tasks in the investigation process. After a thorough investigation of the root causes at the grassroots level, strengthening price controls seems more likely to succeed in practice, because the success of price controls requires thorough control from production to consumption, and the price management agency must also be particularly sound.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Price Investigation Committees in Major Cities to Thoroughly Investigate Illegal Hoarding by Merchants</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly investigate the illegal hoarding of large quantities of major materials by merchants in major cities within the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the authorities have specially established local Material Investigation Committees in the locations of the provincial governments or special municipal governments, and branches of the local Material Investigation Committees in the locations of the county governments and municipal governments. A reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Material Investigation Committees in major cities within the three provinces have been organized under the leadership of the highest local administrative officials and are actively launching work. Their tasks mainly involve two aspects: matters related to the investigation of hoarding of major materials and matters related to proposing countermeasures to prevent hoarding.</p>
<h3>All Banks and Firms Handling Year-End Closing of Accounts</h3>
<p>The thirty-second year of the Republic of China is coming to an end. All banks and firms in the city have followed the usual practice of closing their accounts. Yesterday (the 20th), interest was settled for all current account deposits in the commercial and savings departments. All outstanding loans from current account holders must be repaid in full by the end of this year. The Central Savings Bank and the Bankers' Association Joint Reserve will generously supply funds for interbank lending in order to ensure a smooth passage through the end of the year. It is reported that all financial institutions have profits this year.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Trading at the Stock Exchange Due to Settlement Leads to Active Over-the-Counter Trading; Most Stocks See Squeezes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, stock exchange trading was suspended for one day for settlement. A few brokers traded in their own firms, and trading was quite active. The market hovered, rising and falling in the morning, and strengthening again in the afternoon. In the end, most stocks saw squeezes. The yarn dealers continued to buy yarn from the yarn factories, causing Wing On to break through the 200 yuan mark, while the cotton mills caused the former to rise faster than the latter. Everyone is optimistic. Here are the prices of various industry stocks today:</p>

Swan 800 yuan, Community Life Garden 115 yuan, Three Friends Industrial 1,400 yuan, and China Coal Mining 3,150 yuan.</p>

Yesterday, Class C bonds initially weakened slightly, but soon fell continuously, and market sentiment was very weak. The market rebounded slightly at noon, but the final price fell even further than last week. Classes A, B, D, and E all declined slightly, and it was difficult to boost market sentiment.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending: Yesterday morning, the Bankers Association's lending rate was 1.6 fen, down another 0.1 fen, and the money market gradually eased.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>China Chemical Industrial Company: The company's factories include the Sino-American, Sino-Southern, and Wah Fung factories, which have been established for over three years, specializing in the production of hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, sodium sulfide, bleaching powder, soda ash, and other chemicals, as well as various condiments and raw materials. Previously, the various factories required a large amount of raw materials, and due to transportation issues, they could not be purchased at the same time, resulting in the inability to fully operate. It is reported that the company has already purchased all the raw materials, such as tax-exempt industrial salt and allocated sulfuric acid and coal, so the company's three factories will all start full production on December 1st to meet market demand. It is also reported that the company is scheduled to hold a shareholders' meeting on the 29th of this month to increase capital.</p>

<h3>National Forum: Points to Improve on the Purchase of Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>— A Commoner</p>
<p>In order to address the speculative national sentiment, curb price increases, and stabilize the people's livelihood, the government has launched a comprehensive purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in the Shanghai area. Law-abiding and legitimate yarn and cloth merchants, deeply aware of complying with national policies, immediately ceased operations and applied to sell all their inventory in accordance with the deadlines, daring not to conceal anything. Now, as April approaches, rice, coal, and other supplies are increasingly expensive, and yarn and cloth merchants, as well as merchants connected to the yarn and cloth industry, are in dire straits, facing immense hardship. Speculators have shifted their focus, and hoarders have moved from one item to another. Prices have not been curbed, and the people's livelihood has become even more difficult to stabilize. This is something that the government did not anticipate when it ordered the purchase of yarn and cloth! The suffering experienced by legitimate yarn and cloth merchants, as well as the key points for improving the purchase of yarn and cloth, are listed below:</p>
<p>Legitimate merchants have limited capital and usually rely on transactions with banks and firms and deposits from relatives and friends to make adjustments. Now that business has been suspended, banks and firms cannot add to their debts, and depositors are also demanding withdrawals, exhausting all resources and making it difficult to cope. The prices set in the "Outline for the Implementation of Yarn and Cloth Purchase" are already very low compared to the cost (about a quarter of the market price at the time of purchase), and the earliest installment payments are required to be made in three months, while the later ones require waiting for three years. If a business has an inventory of one million yuan (calculated at the market price at the time of purchase) but only owes 250,000 yuan (excluding capital), even if it receives half of the bid deposit, the accumulated interest (3% monthly interest on bank debts) and increased expenses will make it impossible to cover the price, and bankruptcy will be inevitable.</p>
<p>The price for the purchase of yarn and cloth has been set, but since the payment cannot be obtained in one lump sum, the prices of various commodities will no longer be at the level of August 10, 1943, when the first installment is paid on January 1, 1944. There is even less certainty about the future. If merchants use the proceeds from the purchase to buy rice, coal, and daily necessities, the ratio will be out of balance, and even maintaining operations will be difficult. It is hoped that the government will follow the example of the amnesty for criminals after the Greater East Asia Alliance, opening a way out and discounting half of the special fixed-term deposit certificates without interest, paying the bid deposit in one lump sum.</p>
<p>Goods are the lifeline of merchants, so merchants cherish their goods as they would innocent children. Original items are placed in boxes or packages, and unpacked items are placed on shelves, neatly arranged and managed by designated personnel. Once moved after purchase, they become easily damaged, stained, and shortages occur, which is only one of the problems. Now, the Bureau of Commerce and Trade has taken this into consideration and has included unpacked yarn and cloth as specially managed items. The unpacked yarn and cloth that has already been transported should be returned to the original applicants for sale, properly sorted, and placed on shelves to facilitate distribution.</p>
<p>In a wartime economy, increasing production is always the top priority. Since the purchase of yarn and cloth, factories have shut down, and merchants have been idle. Not only is there no production, but expenses are being wasted. According to statistics from the Cloth Merchants Association, there are over 2,600 member firms, with monthly expenses of approximately 78 million yuan. The number of yarn factories, cloth factories, yarn firms, and cotton and miscellaneous goods umbrella factories connected to yarn and cloth is unknown. It is requested that allocations be made as soon as possible so that workers can fulfill their abilities and merchants can secure their businesses. This will not only stabilize the people's livelihood but also increase production, which is essential for curbing price increases.</p>
<p>The allocation process is divided into general wholesalers, wholesalers, and retailers. Before the control of yarn and cloth, yarn and cloth merchants from other areas purchased from wholesalers in Shanghai. The general wholesale stage in other areas should follow the example of Japanese trading companies and be undertaken by wholesalers in Shanghai. If it has been stipulated that it should be handled by the local branches of the Cotton Products Federation, then a certain amount of this profit should also be extracted and distributed proportionally to the amount of inventory sold by the Shanghai wholesalers, in order to be fair. (Wholesalers have no monthly retention amount, and the suffering they have endured after the purchase is the deepest. There are 700 retail member firms of the Cloth Merchants Association, while there are over 1,900 wholesale firms.) The work of purchasing yarn and cloth has been going on for three months. Although the names have been changed frequently and the inspection and acceptance have been time-consuming, there should be a budget for handling the matter. Although the deadline of September 6th has been changed to October 1st, the Bureau of Commerce and Trade has issued a notice to all applicants for sale to collect storage certificates in order, so that merchants can obtain the payments on time, which is a very kind intention. However, when merchants apply for storage, they must fill in prices, find guarantors, and submit them. The Cotton Industry Administration must verify the prices, calculate the payments, verify the guarantors, and distribute storage certificates and exchange certificates. It is difficult to predict whether all the procedures can be completed before the first payment date. It is requested that the process be expedited as soon as possible so that merchants are not disappointed.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— By Iwatata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Youth (2)</p>
<p>"After all, Second Middle School is better!"</p>
<p>A student wearing a newly made school cap and a bright school badge exclaimed. It was Taguchi Takao speaking to Masato.</p>
<p>"That's natural!"</p>
<p>Masato, wearing a standard uniform, smiled as usual.</p>
<p>Both had successfully entered the prefectural Second Middle School. To thank the gods, they went to worship at the Showa Shrine and the Arata Hachiman Shrine.</p>
<p>Neither had a devout belief. However, it was the local custom to visit the tutelary deity's shrine, the local temple, and then the ancestors' graves whenever something happened. Now, they were walking home.</p>
<p>"It's such a beautiful day! Let's go play by the sea!"</p>
<p>Masato looked up at the strong sunlight, sweat streaming down his face. Although it was the Enthronement Day of Emperor Jinmu on April 3rd, the cherry blossoms had already fallen.</p>
<p>"No, aren't you coming to my house today? My mother and the others are waiting!"</p>
<p>Takao remembered his mother's words when he left. She was preparing lunch to celebrate her son's and friends' entrance into school.</p>
<p>"It's fine to go, but I feel constrained being with your family."</p>
<p>Masato seemed reluctant. Finally, on the condition that he wouldn't have to meet the family, he agreed to wait.</p>
<p>Although they didn't see the sea, the sea breeze blowing from that direction brushed against them. The two strode towards the Arata residential area.</p>
<p>"I always want to join the navy."</p>
<p>Takao said loudly, revealing his ambition. He had only just entered middle school but was already dreaming of taking the entrance exam for the Naval Academy.</p>
<p>He had been fascinated by the navy since the fifth grade of elementary school. Because of that fascination, he had originally wanted to attend First Middle School when entering middle school. First Middle School was a school for talented students, and graduates had a high chance of entering the Higher Normal School, Naval Academy, or Military Academy. The pristine white uniforms of First Middle School students became the object of envy for young boys. At the same time, Second Middle School was considered a haven for mischievous children. Recently, the general criticism seemed to have changed since Professor Kawada from the Tokyo Gakushuin was appointed as the new principal, but it still couldn't compare to First Middle School. Takao gave up his long-held desire to attend First Middle School and entered Second Middle School because he didn't want to be separated from his close friend Masato. The friendship at Second Middle School was that close.</p>
<p>As for Masato, it didn't matter whether it was First Middle School or Second Middle School. However, he listened to his older brother Masajiro's advice and passed Second Middle School. He already felt beyond expectations to be able to enter middle school. (Wasn't his older brother Yoshikazu going to drop out of commercial school midway?)? It was questionable whether he would continue to a higher-level school after graduating from there. His mother was already fifty-six years old. Seeing her tireless efforts day and night, he really wanted to be able to go out into society and work to ease her burden as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Before they knew it, the two had arrived in front of Taguchi's house.</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>Our Newspaper's Social Services Department Distributes Warm Clothing to Hidden Poverty</h3>
<p>Recently, the prices of all goods in the city have been expensive, and the people's livelihood is difficult, with a great sense of unsustainability. Poor people lack adequate clothing and food, and cannot afford cotton cloth. The colleagues of this newspaper, being concerned about this, launched a campaign to make warm clothing on behalf of others at the beginning of last month. Thanks to the enthusiastic contributions from all sectors, benefiting the poor, over two hundred sets have been distributed successively in recent days. During this severe winter climate, the generally thinly dressed hidden poor (poor teachers, civil servants, cultural figures, artists, low-paid workers) who received warm clothing benefited greatly. Our department is currently rushing to produce more, and the Clothing Donation Committee has formulated the following measures:</p>
<p>The distribution targets are limited to hidden poverty in all sectors. The distribution procedure requires first coming to this department to obtain an application form, filling it out, and obtaining certification from a legitimate professional or store with a seal. After sending it to this department, it will be investigated and verified, and then the applicant must bring their citizen ID card to this department to receive a warm clothing voucher, stamped upon receipt. It cannot be received again next year. Charitable organizations entrusted this department to make a large number of warm clothing on their behalf and are not allowed to raise the price of Korean donations. To make warm clothing on behalf of others, one must register at this department and collect it from the clothing production department in installments. The acceptance of large-scale warm clothing donation funds will be stopped from today.</p>
<h3>Electricity Consumption Counter Distributed to Users</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company has notified all users to implement conservation measures starting from the first of this month. Therefore, all users should record the readings of the two electricity meters daily, and stop using electricity immediately when exceeding the limit. In order to facilitate users, Yishun Xieji Printing Company has specially printed "Daily Electricity Consumption Counter" for distribution to all sectors. Only need to send a return postage of five jiao. Can be sent a copy. The address is No. 87 Taoyuanfang, Qipulu, North Henan Road.</p>
<h3>Warm Clothing Donation Report</h3>
<p>Anonymous person 200 yuan, celebrating parents' longevity 3,200 yuan, total 3,400 yuan.</p>
