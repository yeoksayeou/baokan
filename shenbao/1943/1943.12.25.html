<p>社評</p>
<h3>冬賑急迫</h3>
<p>本年度冬賑，早已成立經費籌菜委員會，決定勸募辦法，籌募經　目標為一千萬元，分四次揭曉，第一次定十一月三十日，第二次定十二月十日，第三次定十二月二十日，目前巳逾三次揭曉之期，截至昨日（第十二號捐款報吿）為止，募得捐款總數為二百五十五萬餘元，僅及總數四分之一·自開始籌募迄今，歷時月餘，如此成績，不能不引為憾事。</p>
<p>按此次勤募單位，分爲二百隊，每隊分任五萬元，隊長身分，或為企業界負一人，或為殷富，如能實心勸募，則五萬元之數，不難短期集成。換言之，如果勸募隊長根本對於冬賑捐款，漠不關心，旣不設法勤募，又不肯自掏腰包，那末，莫說一個月，就是一年，也不會完成目標。稱「勸募」者，原是出於自動心，發於正義感，而非強制攤認。不過，當局既經推重，貧爲隊長，自有其社會上之聲譽與地位，况且事屬賬舉，為善最樂。孟子云：「惻隱之心，人皆有之」。社會上有聲譽有地位者，豈同情之心竟如此薄弱呢？我們建議冬賑籌募經費委員會當局，卽日專函通吿尙未勸募或勸募不足之各隊長，勉勵其從速實心勸募，限期結束。同時，我們盼望擔任勸慕隊長諸君，設身處地，為待賑急迫的者難同胞打算，為行善積福着想，視作不可諉卸的義務，從速苦口婆心，向親友廣為勸募，多出一分力量，就是替待賑同胞解除一分痛苦。</p>
<p>其次，我們對於勸募超過擔仟數目者，如王益之，洪楨良兩君各得二十四萬元，何焯賢，周友常，王維琯，沈維挺，陳紹媯諸君均在十萬元以上，陳市長經募也超出十萬元，熱忱勸寡，表示敬意。</p>
<p>聞新藥業與銀錢業均願認萬一百萬元，熱忱毅力，尤為可嘉·希望及早促成事實，以為各業倡導。如各業能際此年終結紅，撥出一部分充作善舉，是多麽有意義的事。各業公會中不乏卓識遠見，樂善好施之士，希望領導同業，提倡撥給紅金助賑。在此次冬賑捐款中，各業公會能占多數，叉是多麽榮耀的事。</p>
<p>總之，天時嚴寒，冬賑及時，勸募捐款，迫於眉睫。擔任隊長諸君，從速完成任務，應於年內結束，至少達到預定一千萬元目標。至於如何施賑，希望主持當局依照方案從速擬辦，以慰捐款者期望，以解待賑者倒懸。</p>
<p>最後，我們將以沉重的心情，向讀者尤其是「狂歡之夜」的「享受者」進一言，今天木報所戰調查，昨夜本巿各大跳舞塲等娛樂塲所，舞與菜的消耗，統計在五千萬元以上。超過一年冬賑總目標五倍，那末，在「較歌載舜」，「餐色餐味」之餘，稍稍分出一部分消耗，向代收賑款的銀行繳付，救助「宿風餐雨」，「無衣無食」的苦難同胞，也不會苛求吧！</p>
<h3>新不列顛島方面日海軍機隊戰果　敵據點及大批艦船受重創</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日大本營二十四日下午四時發表：　帝國海軍航空部隊，曾於二十三日平明轟炸馬加斯角附近及阿羅埃島之敵據點，除使八處起火外，並炸燬敵登陸用舟艇二艘（重創）。　帝國海軍航空部隊於二十三日上午邀　來　拉巴爾之敵機約七十架，擊落其二十四架（內四架未證實），我機未返基地者六架。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日海軍機隊自本月十五日起而二十三日止，於新不列顛島馬加新角及拉巴爾方面所獲之綜合戰果，（僅限於日大本營發表者）如次：　予敵軍之損害，擊沉敵巡洋艦或驅逐艦二艘，大型運輸船三艘，特殊輸送船或中型運輸船四艘乃至五艘，特殊運輸船，中型運輸船二艘，特別運輸船之運輸艇二艘以上，特殊運輸船二艘，小型運輸船四艘，運輸艇一艘，大型登陸用舟艇八十艘，以上共計百零七艘以上。擊毀敵大型巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘，運輸船一艘，小型運輪船三艘，特殊運輸船二艘，運輸艇一艘，大型登陸用舟　三艘、登陸用舟艇及小舟艇多數，共計十三艘以上。擊落敵機六十二架（內朱證實者四架。　目方損害，飛機自炸及未歸還者二十八架。</p>
<h3>日軍掌握制空權拉巴爾展開激戰　來襲敵機擊落二十四架</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　敵軍於本月十五日在新不列顚島馬加斯角登陸以來，企圖進攻日軍之戰略要地拉巴爾，故戰况日形擴大，到與日軍展開猛烈激戰中、日海軍機隊連日策應陸上部隊協力作戰，二十三日猛炸馬加斯角敵軍登陸地點·是日有敵機約七十五架來聾拉巴爾，窺其意圖，頗砍先覆滅拉巴爾之日軍基地，期使馬加斯角登陸之敵軍順利進展，因敵軍在該方面登陸以來，尙未能設立堅强之橋頭堡也。但日軍　仍掌握拉巴爾一帶之制空權，故敵軍進攻難為　之前所未有。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　敵軍一部自在新不列顚島馬加斯角阿羅埃及比萊羅兩島上陸以來，因遭日海陸軍機隊及地上部隊之不斷猛擊，今巳遭遇重大危機，故力謀在新不列顚島建榮飛行場，除企圖强行補給與增援外，並總動員其飛機，不斷攻擊該島方面日軍基地，更以拉巴爾為目標，於二十三日上午以統一式B24型重轟炸機二十七架，洛基特P38，波特西哥斯基F41b，巨人F61b等戰鬥機四十八架，合計七十五架之大編隊，來襲拉巴爾，日海軍戰鬥機當即昇空遨擊，突入敵機羣中，經展開壯烈力戰後，繫薄其二十四架（內未證實者四架），包括B24型機五架，P38型機一架，F41b二架F61b九架，是役日機未歸還者六架。另一方面日海軍機運日猛炸馬拉斯角附近敵登陸地點，如日大本營迭次所發表者，日海軍機猛炸敵增按運輪船團，收獲英大戰果。又於二十三日冒惡劣天氣飛襲馬加斯角及阿羅埃之敵據點，密集投彈，除使敵軍事設施八處中彈起火外，並重創敵登際用舟艇二艘，使敵上陸部隊陷於苦境。</p>
<h3>宗古河北海岸區日軍奇襲美陣地　波島敵機塲及倉庫被炸</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地電，新幾內亞島芬希哈罕方面，日·美兩軍刻於宗古河北方地區　峙中，連日仍不斷展開激戰。十九日夜日敢死隊冒雨潛入宗古河北方海岸地區之敵軍陣地後方，奇農成功，投　炸彈及手榴彈，襲　敵汽車密集部隊及　幕畢，使敵軍陷於混亂，日敢死隊乘敵軍混亂中，縱橫活躍，將敵野戰倉庫炸毀，並炸毀敵坦克車一輛，汽車兩輛。又其他一隊，亦於是日平明奇　敵軍陣地，炸毀敵坦克車一輛，使敵部隊潰亂。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　南太平洋日軍某基地訊：日陸軍機十七日夜曾轟炸新幾內亞島芬希哈罕北方宗古　北岸之敵軍登陸地點，炸沉或重創敵軍魚雷蜓多艘，其隆上設施，亦有二被炸起火。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地電，日海軍機隊二十日未明，曾連續兩次急龔波根維爾島特羅某納角敵機場及倉庫，投彈猛炸，有四處中　爆炸起火，日機有一架未返。</p>
<h3>學校整理要綱　日閣已通過　確立「軍學一體」關係</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日文部省根據今年十月十二日閣議通過之「戰時敎育非常措置方策」，近曾積極研究學制之根本改革辦法，茲巳獲得成果，攔定一學校整理要綱」，二十一日提出閣議，巳原案通過，並已由情部局及文部省發表。此次之學校整理要綱，乃參照二十三日同時發表之降低徵兵年齡之措置，而須定對大學，高等學校，專門學校澈底予以整理，其目的在調整「學」以應「軍」之要求，一面充實軍之要員，一面積極增強軍之作戰力，而期確立「軍學一體」之關係，故可稱為日本敎育史上之空前改革。其要綱即將戰時敎育集中於以下四點：　敎育內容之澈底刷新與能率化。　養成爲增強戰力之技術要元。　徹底實施勤勞動員。　振興精神科學等、而求其迅速實踐。茲再將前述四點之具體辦法加以補述，第一點為實行入學資格。　業年限及學校之改變專門學校以　於被徵年齡而結束其敎育。又關於學校敎育內容之刷新，除使高等商業學校改作高等工業學校外，並改組工業經營專門學校及經濟專門學校（以上均為暫稱），外國語學校則使其成為專門學校，使學生綜合　得大東亞及其他國家之一般知義及語言。此外·工業·　業·農業·齒科等專門學校，亦各適應時局，而予以改革。關於大學亦有所刷新，如商科大學即使之以產業經營為重心，而加以改組。第二點為以大量養成優秀之按術人員為目的，而整理擴充理科系之專門學校及大學。關於第三點，則基於本年六月二十五日閣議決定之「確立學生戰時動員體制要網」，規定靑年學生在學期間每年有三分之一之勒勞作業，此次更鑒於充足勞務之緊要性，故再將文科系學校之事生定額予以縮减，以適應勤勞要求，而增加直接有助於增强戰力之理科系招生定額。第四點則在對各大學之精神硏究科學設施以國庫加以補助，蓋由縮减文科系學校定額及入伍關係觀之，此次之改革學制，似有輕視精神科學之傾向，實則日教靑當局之意向絕非如此，故特為振興精神科學，乃對大學之精神科學硏究加以補助。</p>
<h3>敵機襲馬紹爾　擊落十二架</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　據太平洋日取某基地電，敵P38型機八架，曾於二十一日晨來襲馬紹爾羣島之米勒島，日海軍戰鬥機及該島守備隊當即對之迎擊，結果擊落敵機五架、日機有一架未歸。此外，馬紹爾羣島馬　拉浦環礁中之塔羅娃島，是日上下午亦有敵B24型機來襲，前後共達二十七架·經海軍戰鬥機連擊落其七架、日機亦犧牲一架，陸上損害輕微。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地電。二十二日曾有敵B24型機三架來襲日本內南洋凱塞淋島，當被擊退，是日內南洋湦特島亦有敵B24型機三架來襲，其中一架被日軍擊落，日方則無損害。</p>
<h3>蔡培夫人歡宴　日要人夫人</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　我國駐日大使蔡培氏夫人、為與日政府各要人夫人聯歡，二十四日下午五時半曾在大使館舉行招待宴，屆時到有東條首相夫人，以下星野書記官長，重光外相，島田海相，靑木大束亞相，　部文相，賀屋藏相等夫人，以及日本婦人會會長山內公爵夫人等多人，席問賓主極盡歡洽，對於促進中日婦女之親密關係尤多交換意見，七時餘始盡歡而散，此可謂中日外交史上之一特殊盛會。聞明後日蔡大使夫人返將繼續與日本其他朝野要人之夫人聯歡</p>
<h3>日文學報國會員　願入軍需廠工作</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日本文學報國會動勞包裹隊隊員，頃悲憤馬金島達拉瓦島之日軍壯烈殉國及英美熾烈之反攻，深感後方國民資任之重大，並認為過去自由職業之作家生活，直接對於完成戰爭並無多大貢獻，均願入軍需工廠工作，增產軍需品，以供前綫將士殺敵，而盡後方國民之天職，聞交學報國會巳允各會員之請，最近即將分配彼等入軍需工廠工作。</p>
<h3>受日機猛擊　美機襲粵受挫　被擊落飛機十二架</h3>
<p>廣州二十四日中央社電　駐渝美空軍，因受日軍機隊連日猛攻，巳蒙極大打擊，故僅出以游擊式之反攻。二十三日十六時許，其戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊，復來襲廣州地區。日軍機隊當即起飛迎擊，遂展開壯烈空戰。同時日軍地上砲火亦對之猛擊，結果擊落其P40型機十一架（內爾架未證實，）及P51型機一架，並擊中其他轟炸機數架，而日軍無</p>

<h3>印緬國境空戰　美機損失重大　被擊毀二百餘架</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　緬甸日軍某基地電，緬甸方面日睦軍機，因攻擊中印空路，對渝印空軍巳確保絕對優勢。曼特巴頓及敵軍首腦部，企圖　囘緬甸，或行空襲日本本土，然自陸海軍機精銳轟炸加爾各答以來，彼等頓感動搖。例如新德里電台，　傳日機之威力，竟有對英本國政府訴苦之言辭。自本年十月雨季過　，至轟炸丁蘇基阿僅兩月餘之交戰期間，印緬國境空戰，巳有極大變化。蓋自十月以來，日機擊落擊毀敵機巳達二百二十餘架之多，此等敵機多係B24，C45，C47等大利機。今日飛機數量與駕駛員之實量，殆可絕對左右作戰之勝負。敵方　兩月間，兌喪失駕駛員五百餘名，其狼狽情形，自己無法掩。日攻　部隊，自十月二十日轟炸吉大港以來，殆未遇敵機挑戰。十二月五日空襲加爾各答時，雖豫料敵機必行挑戰，然你與哈里肯機，及P51型敵機六十餘架交戰，而敵戰鬥機數百架竟袖手旁觀。迨轟炸了蘇基阿時，始有正面空戰，交戰三十分鐘，擊落敵機十六架。敵空軍之脆弱，愈形暴露。其他如印緬國境方面之戰鬥，敵機每遭日機轟炸，輒離陸遁走，全無戰意。敵方為應付日機之猛炸，甚而動員補給渝方之部隊。十一月下旬，曾數次以戰鬥轟炸機數十架之編隊，空襲仰光。敵B24型中隊長機於某地被日機擊落，中隊長被俘，而均不悉該機隨員之姓名，此足證　等自美國來印後，即奉命森炸緬甸，無暇知曉現地駕駛員之姓名。至成俘　後，始互通姓字，而發生此種令人不能相信之奇怪現象。最近自美本土經南美巴西之納塔爾，橫斷大四洋經開羅亞了，抵達喀　　之空路運輸，亦頗不如意。連結中國大陸與印度之補給路，因受日機威脅，只可作遊擊行動。同時日機自雨季過後，到處活躍，而敵機根本無作戰方針。此即敵對緬甸方面空戰無一貫作戰目的之左證，敵方雖擴大宣傳，然敵空軍之晚弱性，巳暴露無遺。現仍作擾亂緬甸治安之盲炸云。</p>

<h3>葡屬馬特拉島　傳英軍登陸</h3>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電　據里斯本流行之謠言，英海軍已在馬特拉島Modeira登陸，意圖佔領該島。（按馬特拉島係位於大西洋中，在摩洛哥之西）但葡萄牙官塲方面尙無證實之消息，謠傳並謂邱吉爾首相擾在該島過冬資休餋。</p>
<h3>北方島要塞的強化</h3>
<p>日本防衛綫的最北端，冬季的北千島，現正風雲漫天、以後的日子，銀色的雲層低垂着，雪花紛飛，乘着吹過鄂密茨克海的悽　的寒風，散佈在每一個島上，丈餘高的搸木，深埋在雪下，除山上一抹松樹的薄黑色外，一片銀粉世界。衝着這凜冽的風雪，日軍正片刻不懈地警備着，積極建設堅固的基地，默　地繼續南方光輝的戰果。</p>
<p>美國　其所有的力量，對新幾內亞，所羅門方面，或吉爾伯特方面，不斷的進行睦海空大攻勢。而阿留申方面敵的攻勢，僅八月十二日，九月十二日有二次空襲，自此以後，約有三個月，依然保持着暴風雨前的靜寂。</p>
<p>但戰况雖然這樣靜寂，依然不拋棄侵攻北方的夢，自攻略阿圖島以後，即積極從事建設前進基地，極為活躍。自阿留申羣島過來，如阿圖島·基斯加島，塞密奇島·阿開茲島·阿姆蒂托加島·伽羅洛伊島·　爾茨克島等，均在整備為前進基地，連結後方的達吉哈巴，庫捷克等後方基地，造成一條有力北方侵攻路，以北美B25型，統一式B24型，波音B17型，PBY的重轟炸機陣，再配以戰鬥機羣六七百架，處親耽耽，企圖從北方前來襲擊。現在該方面除特設航空母艦二，巡洋艦二，及其他若干外，不見艦船的動靜，至　上兵力，自基斯加登陸後，一部分亦已撤退，該方面包括阿拉斯加在內共有六師團在待機中。　日本加以無言的壓力。</p>
<p>敵方遲早必將來襲</p>
<p>希望由短期決戰以一決雌雄的美國，何時把其銳錢轉向北方侵攻路，雖不可測，唯擁有龐大的兵員武器的美國，伺機以待，與中南太平洋方面的攻勢平行，直接從阿留申羣島方面攻擊日本本土的打算，從最近對吉爾伯特的新攻勢看來，自在意料之中。美國欲攻略北太平洋，自不能不從占領千島列島的占守島開始。如其占領占守島，則從千島列島南下，可以進攻北海　。敵方想設定在地形上有力的戰鬥機，轟炸機飛行隊的飛行基地，從此點看來。自然先須在這裏尋求立脚點。敵方來襲的時　，大約是先用大規模的　茲傘隊及戰車羣登陸，這樣，北太平洋戰綫，隨時有爆發的可能，北千島的陰擊之空，在沈寂中漂蕩着緊張的空氣</p>
<p>千島全島的要塞化</p>
<p>千島列島綿延而北，劃成一道弧綫，有如防止北太平洋怒　的防波堤。在地形上自然担任着防衛日本本土的重大任務。因一九二二年的華盛頓條約中限制太平洋防備條款中的規定，完全放置為不設防地帶，但在”本前通基地進出於基斯加，阿　島等短短的年月中，千島列島的每個島以可驚的速度變成大基地，現在聯結各要塞的强紉的鐵鎖，對必將來襲的敵人，　然扼守着大東亞防衛綫最左端。</p>
<p>「千島是日本的土地，不能使美國踏入一步。」這是防衛千島的全體將士之一貫信念。來襲的敵人在海中就予以擊潰，免於此的在岸邊使之潰减，絕對不使登陸，這是防衛千島的最高目標。因此，日以繼夜，繼續着建設基地的激烈工作，結果，本來沒有一條滋路的島上，山與山之間蜿蜓着冤廣的汽車路，原係　木矮木的灌木林的凍土地帶，開　着廣闊的飛行塲，巨砲　視着雲烟標渺的北太平洋的彼方，千島的地形，一天一天的變樣了。</p>
<p>駐屯將士們的勞苦</p>
<p>記者在某一天的睛日，前往視察建設飛行堪的情形。掩覆着廣大飛行塲的白雲，映照着陽光，目為之眩。空中，飛機編成隊伍，巡迴哨戒着，銀翼閃閃地發光。建築資材在雲中　碌硌碌地林動着。三角兵合的建集，掩蘇陣地的構築的聲響，直透天空，利用晴天建設基地，充滿着奮鬥的朝氣。</p>
<p>視察飛行塲的歸途，由隊長之勸，寄宿於宿舍一夜。所謂宿舍者是幕舍，疎疎落落地散佈在雪地。專心在北千島建設道路，飛機塲，倉庫的結果，營房不被注意，直到目前方才念速建築營房，所以猶有度着幕舍生活的隊伍。</p>
<p>幕舍是人錐形的天幕，僅當中支柱的周圍，往地面掘下，放着火　。地面上舖着松葉和草，如沒有松葉和草，就直接舖着席子，上面擊一層防水布以代床疊，再數氈毯，就作睡處。所以乾燥的土地還好，如其是略為濕潤的土地，慕舍內的東西，因濕氣而發霉，火爐熄了之後，嚴寒非常，不能成眠。</p>
<p>確價敵人必來襲擊的日本千島將士，決心「守護神州的皇土」，充滿着「必報阿圖島之仇」的鬥志，雖在風雪漫天之中，毫不懈怠地繼續着嚴格的訓練，及構築陣地。（翔：譯自十二月十日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>鹽田大尉談　柴崎部隊戰績　英勇殉國令人敬佩</h3>
<p>中央社訊盟邦艦隊報道部，於昨（二十四日）下午四時，在外灘三號上海水交社舉行定例報道常會，部長松島大佐因公返國，由議田大尉代表發言，對守衛暴拉瓦島及瑪金島之盟邦海軍陸戰隊柴崎部隊及軍屬以寡敵衆，使敵軍蒙受巨大損失後玉碎殉國一節，閘述甚詳，原詞如次：</p>
<p>可歌可泣</p>
<p>關於泰拉瓦及聘金二島柴崎部隊英勇作戰殉國經過，不但　動全國，此種戰况値得為全人類所敬仰，日本軍人軍屬之英勇戰况，自二百年來，即具有此種精神，而在此二島之作戰，亦即吾陸戰隊此種精神之具體表現。當音方柴崎部隊僅以寡兵三千守衛二島，而敵以五萬之衆來犯，且用水陸兩用之戰車數百輛，加以輕砲猛射，而吾柴崎部隊則始終不屈不撓，抵抗到底，與數十倍於吾之敵軍血戰，支持至五日之久，在支持中並不乞援，並來電謂：「雖音方彈盡援絕，而士氣旺盛振奮異常」云云，即該二島之設營隊一千五百人，雖為軍屬，但當敵砲彈落下時，會照常工作，此種勇敢，若　雖不為軍人，然其精神實如軍人。且有勝於軍人　。其中設營隊以工具為戰具，與敵作戰更屬可歌可泣</p>
<p>美軍損失</p>
<p>此次柴崎部隊之玉碎，使美軍漕受莫大之損失，據夏威　美軍談：日軍官之身先士　，實堪敬佩，由於上述戰果，吾人可設想：　美軍獲得此島嶼其中須經如何困難，　太平洋並不僅為「泰拉瓦」和「瑪金」二島，此外更有很多島嶼，美軍於獲此二島時，巳耗極大之損失，若欲接近日本本土，勢非再犧牲數百萬之人力不可　由於泰拉瓦瑪金二島柴崎部隊之壯烈犧牲，使日本全國民心敵愾同仇之然度更為增高」。復謂：「柴崎司令官於一年半前，曾於上海陸戰隊任參謀長職，與吾等覿而談話時，即可知其聰敏而充益攻擊精神，即前在浙贛等綫作戰時，亦戰績卓著。</p>
<p>在滬貢獻</p>
<p>聞柴崎少將之以身殉國，即在滬華人，亦當同深哀悼，蓋柴崎氏於吾滬實有不能泯滅之事焉。茲特撮述於後：　本市民防空事宜當時亦為柴崎氏所提出，而今則滬上市民防空之推進，一若細胞之分裂，日進一日。　本市保甲組織雖非柴崎司令官一人所創，然其對此組織，實曾實旰勤勞以遏止暴徒之活動，同時為求保甲制度之完備，柴崎氏亦時時親加指導，至今水上保甲，亦巳確立矣。同時柴崎司令官於大束亞戰爭勃發時，對敵產之處理，亦極有條理云云。</p>
<h3>工商聯誼會等歡送　岩井書記官　今日下午舉行茶會</h3>
<p>日本大使館上海事務所岩井　記官，此次藥　新戰，即將離瀝　新。本市工商聯誼會上海市民福利協會，特定於今（二十五）日下午五時，假　亞大樓工商聯誼會會議　，舉行　會歡送，屬時情緒定為熱烈。</p>
<h3>配給煤球　廿七日丐發售　憑五十三號米票領購一斤</h3>
<p>據上海特別市第一區公署佈吿云，自本年十二月二十七日至明年一月三日之期間內，各零售煤球店，得憑第五十三號購米證出售煤球，各店於收到每張購米聯票時，應出售煤球一市斤，價國幣六角正。零售煤球店之名稱及地址，可向該號買米聯票標明之某號零售米店詢問，本佈告不適用於新近併人本區之各轄境。</p>
<h3>新聯會昨舉行　編委會議　討論禁絕地烟賭舞</h3>
<p>上海新聞聯合會為響應禁絕烟賭舞運動，協商擴大宣傳事宜，昨下午五時半假外灘興亞大樓四樓，舉行五次編　委員會議，響應禁絕烟賭舞運動，由値月委員申報　巽成代表任雲鵬，報告此次召開商討饗應情形，由褚保衝，王平·蔣雲章·陳英·潘樂山等先後就響應禁絕烟賭舞運動發表意見綦多，最後結論　一致通過響應禁絕烟睹舞運動，　加强禁絕烟時舞宣傳，　强調烟賭舞之足以危害國家及民生，　要求政府限期禁絕烟賭舞，　希望市府於年內實行禁睹之計劃，及同時實行禁絕烟睹舞。</p>
<h3>八區殉職員警　昨舉行大殮</h3>
<p>中央社訊本市第八區大上海路共舞合門前，於本月十九日發生軍警衝突血案，該管泰山分局警防股主任綦　陽，警長薛德潤，警士嚴德林，曾銀年，朱桂林，金正亞，俄藉　士米洛谷夫，薩斯篤夫等八名，當塲殉職，由第一警局組織殉職員警治喪委員會辦理善後治喪事宜，昨下午二時在萬國殯儀館大殮，市府由趙秘書長代表致祭，第一局因陳兼局長因公在京，由副局長蘇成德渡正監代表主祭，中央稅警團總團長羅君强亦親往致祭，第二警察局長盧英，以及市府所屬各局處會，全市各保甲等及各機關，市民福利協會，市商會理事長袁履登，（程志良，代）各業同業公會等，各團體均派代表往祭。第一局各分局長各科處長等上級長官，均率領員警參加公祭，與祭人員數千餘人·收到各方輓聯花圈甚多。</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>如此戰時生活</h3>
<p>昨晚是「聖誕之夜」，一部分耶穌信徒，以及非信徒而自命時髦之輩，視為享樂機會，狂歡終宵。本報揭載的「豪華之夜淸算」一文，完全是事實報道。我們對此。列舉幾個比照：</p>
<p>第一個比照，大束亞前綫不是在戰爭嗎？忠勇將士、出生入死，以爭取大東亞全民族之自由解放，而後方竟這樣奢糜荒淫，是何居心？</p>
<p>第二個比照，露宿街頭，無衣無食的，不也是圓顱方趾的同胞嗎，冬賬募捐，聲斯力竭，不肯解囊；而舞塲養室，一擲千金無吝色，是何居心？</p>
<p>第三個比照、米糧煤球以及一般物價，日漲夜大，大部分市民為之愁苦，無以生存。而狂歡之徒載歌載舞，得意忘形，是何居心？</p>
<p>第四個比照，電力公司因煤斤困難，限制用電，雖生產事業社會區體亦不例外，而狂歡之夜竟電炬輝煌，如同白畫，是何居心？</p>
<p>我們不禁懷疑，一切的一初，奢靡浪費，似乎在當局默許之中。</p>
<p>如此參戰都布！如此戰時生活！</p>
<p>很快的又是「元旦」「春節」，都是狂歡面目，我們盼望當局應有取締的表示，才說得過去。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>制裁領導物價上漲者</h3>
<p>近年來滬市百物價格直綫上漲，無有巳時，而每次皆有其所謂領導者。最初領導物價上漲者為法幣的外滙價格掛榷，以外灌縮故舶來品漲價，以舶來品漲價，乃引起國貨之連帶漲價；迨外匯統制，於是繼起而領導物價上漲者則為黃金價格之上漲，有貨者皆以金價上漲為其貨物漲價之藉口；迨黃金統制，於是繼起而領導物價上漲者則為食米價格之上漲，有貨者皆以米價上漲為共貨物漲價之藉口；迨配給戶口米及黑市米價跌落，於是繼起而領導物價上漲者則為黑市棉紗布價格之上漲，有貨者皆以衣價上漲為其貨物漲價之藉口；迨棉紗布收歸國有後，物價呆滯無甚漲風者垂三月之久，於是繼起而領導物價上漲者則為電力之限制與煤球價格之上漲，有貨者又皆以燃料價格上漲為其貨物漲價之藉口。此後則不知再有什麽因素來領導物價的普遍上漲了。</p>
<p>戰時人心最浮，一有風吹，便覺草　，所以處處皆足成為商人漲價牟利之藉口；防風之道，自在於增加物資生產，疏通物資來源，至仍有領導物價上漲者在，則當斬草除根，使其永無活動的餘地。</p>
<h3>油糧專委會調查　各地收買情形</h3>
<p>全國商統會油糧專業委員會，對於食油及榨油原料之蒐買工作，進行不遺餘力，該會為欲明瞭各地產區之情况起見，特製調查表格，請各地區食用油業同業聯合會分飭所屬各區同業公會依式詳實通報，其表格內容為花生油豆油蔴油棉籽油菜油可能收買之數量及價格，日期至明年五月止。</p>
<h3>蛋類專業部　明正可成立</h3>
<p>蛋類亦為主要商品之一，關係民生頗互，年來因蛋類統制機構之未能確立，致使產銷兩方，未能合理協調，而售價亦上漲不巳，全國商業統制總會為澈底統制該業起見，　般蛋業專業部，其規程業經理監事聯席會議通通，組織及人事巳在關係人士道密考慮中，可望於明年正式成立。</p>
<h3>華股塲外做價　終為銀根壓小</h3>
<p>昨蹬交停市，華股在塲外極少數同業精有做開，情况由堅即轉平疲，十時左右初做時會有小抬風，不久為軋銀根者吐出而壓下，並有百物統制傳　，地產業獨為買戶垂靑，躍升不少，其他各業股多見軋小，成交不旺。至證交通吿定二十七日開市做至三十日上午為止。今分儲各業股於後：</p>

<h3>豪華之夜淸算　一個事實提供大家討論</h3>
<p>昨晚是「耶穌聖誕之夜，整個上海的享樂塲所，都為之瘋狂竟夕，狂歡之　，竟忘懷了處身什麼時代。這裏，我們作了一次調查，為之淸算一下：</p>
<p>聖誕大菜每客自　一百元起至六百元止。金谷飯店二百元起，新都飯店三百元起，靜安咖啡館三百元，國際摩天樓四百元，百樂門五百元，法崙斯六百元。</p>
<p>百樂門舞應門票一百元，國際摩天樓一百元，法崙斯二百元。</p>

<p>麗都九時左右拉戰門，舞客因爭入門爭座位而互相毆羅。</p>
<p>各家舞廳莫不滿坑滿谷，誠是車水馬龍前擁後繼，不得其門而入者亦徘徊不去。</p>
<p>各舞塲均以舞池四分之三地位排座，舞客雖似沙丁魚而尙意得志滿。</p>
<p>屬都火爐熊熊，米高美水汀溫暖，其他無應亦莫不滿室生春，電炬如白畫，誰說煤斤困難？誰說電力限制？</p>
<p>聞各舞廳營業通宵，豈經常局特准歟？</p>

<h3>洛陽路上一醫院　上海南洋醫院參觀</h3>
<p>其次，如病者對於社會民族以至國家有相當貢獻，或為上述之機構工作而確係貧困者，其一切費用，均由該院負担，如前次響應申報優待小學敎師等即其一例。不過，對於一般貧病者，認為這是社會重要問題之一部分，應由當局輿社會合力從根本做起、而該院一切經费無外來援助者，雖巳盡力施助，但仍深恨力不從願，至於每逢夏令施行防疫注射，每逢兒童節為兒童義務診療，及承受慈善機關與其他社會團體義務服務等，却是一向不甘落後的。</p>
<p>中國新醫界一個新理想</p>
<p>中國人口號稱四億五千萬，但是新醫人材有多少？雖然沒有正確的統計，似乎決不滿十萬個醫師吧，那麽，平均每四千五百人中只有一位西醫！以與當代各國相較，為如何驚人的比例啊！那麽，天天　維護民族健康，發展醫藥業務，還有什麽實際意義？因此，在今日中國新醫界，提出了異常重要的任務，即是訓練及培養大批科學的醫療人材。</p>
<p>上海南洋醫院創辦的動機本來是為培養新醫人材，二十餘年來對於這一任務，據說從未忽略過一天。首先是院生醫師護士們之日常硏究工作。在醫務部方面，有定期的病歷討論會，專門討論實習醫師駐院醫師臨床記錄及難症檢討。並且規定每星期舉行臨床總　視一次，即檢視及討論一切疑難病症，由各醫師分別發表意見，申述理論，進行學理與實際的硏究，除上述經常互相切磋舉行討論會外，並有醫務會之組織，其主要目標在於聯絡各醫師間之感情，硏究學術，推進院務及協助訓練醫務人員</p>
<p>護士部的敎育工作更為緊張，以南洋醫院高級護士職業學校為中心，該校敎員，都向各著名護士學校專聘，該院各科主任醫師亦負有講解有關醫學課程的實任，這一學期的學生六十三名、都是初中畢業程度，亦有初中以上者。據說今後為了提高護士敎育，希望錄取高中程度者，至於學科，則完全按照中華護士學校高級護士職業學校課租標準，學業期限規定試讀期半年，正修期三年、凡在試期內各科成續滿七十分以上者，得加入正修班。學生除在課室內受課外，並在各病室及門診臨床實習，每病室有兩位護士主任，負責指導學生，使有充足的學識與實際的經騐。每個學生在病室工作八小時，除臨床護理外並負有保健防病健康指導之責。而領導護士之主管人員、還按月召集會議一次，報告各病室之工作情形，並討論如何共謀進步，養成學生有自動硏究及工作的習慣。課外活動則有球類運動及音樂會等。</p>
<p>一般醫務工作人員，也在總務部的範圍內注意日常的進修，在工作方面，採行三八制，職員及工友均分日夜班輪流工作。他們的進習工作，有讀書會，音樂會，球隊等組織。院工也有讀報班，有强迫進修組，分三組實施，每院除星期日外，規定七至九時分節上課、分國語，簡易之外國語，衛生常識時事，故事等等。使有上進的機會。</p>
<p>顧醫師說，該院除努力本分、為病者服務，及竭力施行援助貧病老之工作外，並努力從事其他有關的社會事業，以期有助於民族之解放。他認為我國民衆對於科學的醫學，亦與其他科學部門一樣尙未被完全了解，而關於本國固有的醫學尤其是　學，亦缺乏科學方法的硏究，對於民族發展前途實為一大阻礙。因此，他以為今日每一個科學的醫學者及醫藥企業家，必須從這裏着眼與下手，為民族的科學的醫藥開闢出一條　莊大道，他說南洋醫院今後將針對國家社會實際情形與需要，特別努力於增加貧病床位，促進預防疾病運動，尤其是集中更大力量於培養及訓練醫務人材方面，過去三年來，他們已注力於此，不問為　約　，同德或其他醫學院之畢業生，為使在正式執業前獲得實習機會，早曾大量收容，予以訓練，苦心孤詣，為國家社會培養人材，除了中國紅十字會醫院之外，怕只有他們在這樣不惜犧牲的苦幹。不過他們認為在國家尙無大規模舉辦此種事業以前，最好是社會上一般有遠見有魄力的大資本家出來合作，以投資方式，使他們擴大醫務人材培養及訓練事業，那麽將來該院之成功，亦即投資合作者的成功，而對於社會，民族及國家前途之貢獻，眞是不可限量了。</p>
<p>「社會事業應公之於社會，社會有力者應斷然起而扶持優良的社會事業」。辭別了南洋醫院，我深有感於此言。（完）</p>

        <h1>1943.12.25</h1>
<h3>Urgent Winter Relief</h3>
<p>This year's winter relief effort has already established a fundraising committee, decided on fundraising methods, and set a fundraising goal of ten million yuan, to be announced in four installments. The first announcement was scheduled for November 30th, the second for December 10th, and the third for December 20th. Currently, the deadlines for the first three announcements have passed. As of yesterday (the twelfth donation report), the total amount of donations raised was just over two million five hundred fifty thousand yuan, only a quarter of the total goal. It has been more than a month since fundraising began, and such results are regrettable.</p>
<p>According to the plan, the fundraising units are divided into two hundred teams, each responsible for fifty thousand yuan. The team leaders are either leading figures in the business community or wealthy individuals. If they sincerely exert themselves in fundraising, it should not be difficult to raise the sum of fifty thousand yuan in a short period. In other words, if the fundraising team leaders are completely indifferent to winter relief donations, neither making efforts to fundraise nor willing to contribute from their own pockets, then it would be impossible to achieve the goal, not just in a month, but even in a year. The term "fundraising" originally implies acting out of one's own volition and a sense of justice, not a forced assignment. However, since the authorities have entrusted them with the position of team leader, they naturally have a certain reputation and status in society. Moreover, this is a public-spirited undertaking, and doing good is the greatest joy. Mencius said, "The feeling of compassion is possessed by all men." How can those with reputation and status in society have such weak compassion? We suggest that the authorities of the Winter Relief Fundraising Committee immediately send special letters to the team leaders who have not yet fundraised or have not fundraised sufficiently, encouraging them to earnestly fundraise as soon as possible and to finish within the set deadline. At the same time, we hope that the gentlemen serving as fundraising team leaders will put themselves in the position of those disaster-stricken compatriots urgently awaiting relief, think about doing good and accumulating blessings, regard it as an inescapable duty, and promptly and earnestly persuade friends and relatives to donate widely. Contributing even a small amount is relieving a portion of the suffering of those compatriots awaiting relief.</p>
<p>Secondly, we express our respect for those who have raised more than their assigned amount, such as Mr. Wang Yizhi and Mr. Hong Zhenliang, who each raised 240,000 yuan, and Mr. He Zhuoxian, Mr. Zhou Youchang, Mr. Wang Weiguan, Mr. Shen Weiting, and Mr. Chen Shaogui, who each raised more than 100,000 yuan. Mayor Chen also raised more than 100,000 yuan through enthusiastic fundraising.</p>
<p>It is heard that the new pharmaceutical industry and the silver and banking industries are both willing to pledge 1.1 million yuan, and their enthusiasm and determination are particularly commendable. We hope they will promptly realize their pledges and serve as an example for other industries. How meaningful it would be if various industries could allocate a portion of their year-end bonuses to charitable causes. There is no lack of insightful and philanthropic individuals in the various trade associations, and we hope they will lead their colleagues in advocating for allocating bonuses to help with disaster relief. How glorious it would be if the various trade associations could account for a significant portion of the winter relief donations.</p>
<p>In short, the weather is harsh, winter relief is timely, and fundraising is urgent. The gentlemen serving as team leaders should complete their tasks as soon as possible, aiming to finish within the year and at least reach the predetermined goal of ten million yuan. As for how to distribute the relief, we hope that the authorities in charge will promptly formulate a plan in accordance with the proposals, to satisfy the expectations of the donors and alleviate the suffering of those awaiting relief.</p>
<p>Finally, we will share a word with readers, especially the "enjoyers" of "carnival nights," with a heavy heart. According to the investigation by this newspaper, the consumption of dance and cuisine in major dance halls and other entertainment venues in the city last night was estimated to be over 50 million yuan, exceeding five times the total goal of the annual winter relief effort. Therefore, after "singing and dancing" and "indulging in food and pleasure," would it be too much to ask to allocate a small portion of this consumption to pay to the banks collecting relief funds, to help those miserable compatriots who are "exposed to the wind and sleeping in the rain" and "without clothes or food"?</p>
<h3>Naval Air Unit's Success in New Britain Island Area: Enemy Strongholds and Many Ships Heavily Damaged</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 24th: The Imperial Navy Air Force bombed enemy strongholds near Cape Gloucester and Aroe Island at dawn on the 23rd. In addition to setting fire to eight places, they also destroyed two enemy landing craft (heavily damaged). On the morning of the 23rd, the Imperial Navy Air Force intercepted approximately 70 enemy aircraft that came to Rabaul and shot down 24 of them (four unconfirmed). Six of our aircraft did not return to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The combined results achieved by the Japanese naval air units in the Cape Gloucester and Rabaul areas of New Britain Island from the 15th to the 23rd of this month (limited to those announced by the Imperial General Headquarters) are as follows: Damage inflicted on the enemy: Sinking of two enemy cruisers or destroyers, three large transport ships, four or five special transport ships or medium-sized transport ships, two special transport ships, two or more transport boats of special transport ships, two special transport ships, four small transport ships, one transport boat, and 80 large landing craft, totaling over 107 ships. Destruction of one enemy large cruiser, two destroyers, one transport ship, three small transport ships, two special transport ships, one transport boat, three large landing craft, and many landing craft and small boats, totaling over 13 ships. 62 enemy aircraft shot down (four of which are unconfirmed). Our side's losses: 28 aircraft self-destructed or did not return.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Control Airspace, Fierce Fighting Unfolds in Rabaul: 24 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy forces landed at Cape Gloucester on New Britain Island on the 15th of this month, they have been attempting to attack Rabaul, a strategic stronghold of the Japanese forces. As a result, the fighting has intensified, and they are now engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese forces. The Japanese naval air units have been cooperating with the ground forces in their operations day after day. On the 23rd, they heavily bombed the enemy landing point at Cape Gloucester. On that day, approximately 75 enemy aircraft came to attack Rabaul, and it seems that their intention was to first destroy the Japanese base at Rabaul, so that the enemy forces landing at Cape Gloucester could advance smoothly. This is because the enemy forces have not yet been able to establish a strong bridgehead since landing in that area. However, the Japanese forces still control the airspace around Rabaul, so the enemy's attack is unprecedentedly difficult.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Since a portion of the enemy forces landed on the islands of Cape Gloucester, Aroe, and Pirae on New Britain Island, they have been under constant attack from the Japanese naval and army air units and ground forces, and they are now facing a major crisis. Therefore, they are trying to build an airfield on New Britain Island. In addition to attempting to forcibly resupply and reinforce their troops, they have mobilized all their aircraft to constantly attack Japanese bases on the island. Aiming at Rabaul, a large formation of 75 aircraft, including 27 unified B24 heavy bombers and 48 fighter planes such as Lockheed P38, Vought F4U, and Grumman F6F, attacked Rabaul on the morning of the 23rd. The Japanese naval fighter planes immediately took off to intercept them, plunging into the enemy formation. After a fierce battle, they shot down 24 of them (four unconfirmed), including five B24s, one P38, two F4Us, and nine F6Fs. Six Japanese aircraft did not return from this battle. On the other hand, Japanese naval aircraft fiercely bombed enemy landing points near Cape Gloucester. As the Imperial General Headquarters has repeatedly announced, Japanese naval aircraft have been fiercely bombing enemy reinforcement convoys, achieving great results. Also, on the 23rd, braving adverse weather conditions, they flew to attack enemy strongholds at Cape Gloucester and Aroe, dropping bombs densely. In addition to causing eight enemy military facilities to be hit and catch fire, they also heavily damaged two enemy landing craft, putting the enemy landing forces in a difficult situation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Launch Surprise Attack on US Positions on the North Coast of the Songo River Area: Enemy Airfields and Warehouses on Bougainville Island Bombed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, Japanese and American forces are stalemated in the area north of the Songo River in Finschhafen, New Guinea, and fierce fighting continues daily. On the night of the 19th, a Japanese suicide squad braved the rain and infiltrated behind enemy positions in the coastal area north of the Songo River, successfully launching a surprise attack. They threw bombs and grenades, attacking densely packed enemy vehicle units and field headquarters, causing confusion among the enemy forces. Taking advantage of the enemy's confusion, the Japanese suicide squad moved about freely, destroying enemy field warehouses, one enemy tank, and two enemy vehicles. Another team also launched a surprise attack on enemy positions at dawn on the same day, destroying one enemy tank and causing the enemy forces to collapse.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific: Japanese army aircraft bombed the enemy landing point north of the Songo River on the north coast of Finschhafen, New Guinea, on the night of the 17th, sinking or heavily damaging several enemy torpedo boats. Some of their facilities were also hit and caught fire.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval air units twice attacked the enemy airfield and warehouses at Torokina Point on Bougainville Island before dawn on the 20th, dropping bombs and causing explosions and fires in four locations. One Japanese aircraft did not return.</p>
<h3>Outline for School Reorganization Passed by Japanese Cabinet: Establishing a "Military-Academic Unity" Relationship</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Based on the "Emergency Measures for Wartime Education" passed by the cabinet on October 12th of this year, the Japanese Ministry of Education has been actively studying fundamental reforms to the school system and has now achieved results. The "Outline for School Reorganization" was finalized and submitted to the cabinet on the 21st. It was passed in its original form and has been announced by the Intelligence Bureau and the Ministry of Education. This "Outline for School Reorganization" is based on the measures to lower the conscription age, which were also announced on the 23rd. It is necessary to thoroughly reorganize universities, higher schools, and vocational schools, with the aim of adjusting "academics" to meet the demands of the "military," enriching the ranks of military personnel on the one hand and actively enhancing military combat power on the other, and establishing a "military-academic unity" relationship. Therefore, it can be called an unprecedented reform in Japanese educational history. The outline will concentrate wartime education on the following four points: Thoroughly refreshing and streamlining educational content. Training technical personnel to enhance combat power. Thoroughly implementing labor mobilization. Promoting spiritual sciences, etc., and striving for their swift implementation. The specific measures for the aforementioned four points are further supplemented as follows: The first point is to implement changes in admission qualifications, years of study, and schools. Vocational schools will aim to complete their education before the age of conscription. Furthermore, regarding the refreshing of school educational content, in addition to converting higher commercial schools into higher technical schools, industrial management vocational schools and economic vocational schools (both provisional names) will be reorganized. Foreign language schools will become vocational schools, enabling students to comprehensively acquire general knowledge and languages of East Asia and other countries. In addition, vocational schools specializing in industry, commerce, agriculture, dentistry, etc., will also be reformed in accordance with the times. Universities will also be reformed, such as reorganizing commercial universities with a focus on industrial management. The second point is to reorganize and expand science and engineering vocational schools and universities with the aim of producing a large number of excellent technical personnel. Regarding the third point, based on the "Outline for Establishing a Wartime Mobilization System for Students" decided by the cabinet on June 25th of this year, it is stipulated that young students will have one-third of their academic year dedicated to labor. Given the urgency of ensuring sufficient labor, the student quotas for humanities schools will be further reduced to meet labor demands, while increasing the enrollment quotas for science and engineering departments, which directly contribute to enhancing combat power. The fourth point is to subsidize spiritual research science facilities in universities with national funds. Judging from the reduction in quotas for humanities schools and the conscription situation, this reform of the school system may seem to undervalue spiritual sciences. In reality, the intentions of the Japanese educational authorities are not at all like this. Therefore, in order to promote spiritual sciences, subsidies will be provided to universities for spiritual science research.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Marshall Islands: Twelve Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the Pacific, eight enemy P38 aircraft attacked Miller Island in the Marshall Islands on the morning of the 21st. Japanese naval fighter planes and the island garrison immediately engaged them, resulting in the shooting down of five enemy aircraft. One Japanese aircraft did not return. In addition, enemy B24 aircraft attacked Tarawa Island in the Majuro Atoll of the Marshall Islands in the morning and afternoon of the same day, totaling 27 aircraft. Naval fighter planes shot down seven of them, and one Japanese aircraft was also lost. The damage on land was minor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, three enemy B24 aircraft attacked Kusaie Island in the Japanese South Seas on the 22nd and were repelled. On the same day, three enemy B24 aircraft also attacked Pohnpei Island in the Japanese South Seas. One of them was shot down by the Japanese forces, and the Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Cai Pei Holds Banquet for Wives of Japanese Dignitaries</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Mrs. Cai Pei, the wife of the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, held a reception banquet at the embassy at 5:30 PM on the 24th to socialize with the wives of various Japanese government dignitaries. Mrs. Tojo, the wife of the Prime Minister, as well as the wives of Chief Secretary Hoshino, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, Naval Minister Shimada, Greater East Asia Minister Aoki, Education Minister Okabe, Finance Minister Kaya, and others, as well as Mrs. Yamanouchi, the president of the Japanese Women's Association, and many others attended. The guests and hosts were extremely convivial, and they exchanged many opinions on promoting closer relations between Chinese and Japanese women. They dispersed after enjoying themselves until after 7:00 PM. This can be described as a special grand event in the history of Sino-Japanese diplomacy. It is heard that Ambassador Cai's wife will continue to socialize with the wives of other Japanese government and civilian dignitaries in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Members of Japanese Literary Patriotic Association Volunteer to Work in Military Factories</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Members of the labor volunteer corps of the Japanese Literary Patriotic Association, saddened by the heroic sacrifices of Japanese soldiers on Makin Island and Tarawa Island and the fierce counterattacks of the British and Americans, deeply feel the importance of the responsibilities of the people in the rear. They believe that their past lives as freelance writers did not contribute much directly to the war effort. Therefore, they all volunteer to work in military factories, increase the production of military supplies to provide for the soldiers fighting on the front lines, and fulfill their duties as people in the rear. It is heard that the Literary Patriotic Association has approved the requests of its members and will soon assign them to work in military factories.</p>
<h3>American Planes Repelled in Attack on Guangdong After Suffering Fierce Attacks from Japanese Planes: Twelve Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) – The American Air Force stationed in Chongqing has suffered great blows due to the continuous fierce attacks by Japanese air units. Therefore, they are only carrying out guerrilla-style counterattacks. At around 16:00 on the 23rd, a combined formation of fighter-bombers attacked the Guangzhou area again. Japanese air units immediately took off to intercept them, and a fierce air battle ensued. At the same time, Japanese ground artillery also fiercely attacked them, resulting in the shooting down of eleven P40 aircraft (some unconfirmed) and one P51 aircraft, as well as hitting several other bombers. The Japanese forces suffered no losses.</p>
<p>Japanese Bombing Results at Kunming Airfield</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Here is an addendum to the results of the Japanese air raids on Kunming airfield on the 18th and 22nd: According to aerial photography, the bombing of Kunming airfield on the 18th destroyed a total of 19 aircraft on the ground, adding two more to the 17 aircraft previously announced by the Imperial General Headquarters. In addition, a total of 29 Chinese aircraft were shot down during the air raid on Kunming on the 22nd.</p>

<h3>84th Japanese Diet to Hold Opening Ceremony Tomorrow: Plenary Session Scheduled for 27th</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The 84th Japanese Diet was convened on the 24th. On this day, members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives arrived one after another at 9:00 AM. By 10:00 AM, both houses had separately proceeded with determining the seating arrangements and mutually electing ministers, directors, and other matters. Thus, both houses were established. After the government and both houses mutually notified each other of this, the meeting was adjourned. Also, the House of Peers held a negotiation meeting of various factions on this day, deciding on the agenda for the year and informally deciding on the chairmen, vice-chairmen, and regular members of each standing committee. The opening ceremony has been decided to be held on the 26th. The House of Representatives broke with precedent on this day, electing the chairmen and standing committee members of the entire house. Next, a plenary session of both houses will be convened on the 27th, where the Ministers of the Army and Navy will report on the war situation and discuss matters of gratitude and condolences for the officers and soldiers. It is expected that both houses will conclude their business within the year and adjourn until January 20th of next year.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The 84th Japanese Diet is the third regular Diet under the Great East Asia War. Since the 77th Diet, there have been three regular Diets and five extraordinary Diets during the Tojo cabinet's wartime administration. During this time, the Japanese Diet fully supported the government by approving various important bills and budget proposals submitted by the government to complete the war and promote construction, boosting national morale, and cooperating with the government in implementing wartime policies. Now, the war situation is becoming more critical. This year is the year to establish the foundation for victory. Emergency measures such as requesting students to enlist and extending the age of military service have been taken to establish a national conscription system. At the same time, measures to strengthen the domestic situation, centered on expanding the production of aircraft and military supplies, have been largely completed. This Diet will deliberate on the government's general account budget proposal of 15.2 billion yen, which is necessary to complete the decisive battle, as well as various special account budget proposals (to be decided next spring) and over 50 bills, including tax increase bills that directly fund the war effort. It is determined to exert the spirit of the Diet's approval and deliberation and to elevate the determination of the Japanese people to complete the war.</p>
<h3>Heavy Losses for American Aircraft in Aerial Battles on the India-Burma Border: Over 200 Aircraft Destroyed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain Japanese base in Burma: Japanese army aircraft in Burma have secured absolute superiority over the India-China air route and are attacking the Chongqing-India air force. Mountbatten and the enemy's headquarters are attempting to recapture Burma or launch air raids on the Japanese mainland, but since the elite bomber forces of the army and navy bombed Calcutta, they have been shaken. For example, the New Delhi radio station broadcast the power of Japanese aircraft, even complaining to the British government. Since the end of the rainy season in October of this year, during the two months of fighting leading up to the bombing of Tinsukia, the aerial battles on the India-Burma border have undergone great changes. Since October, Japanese aircraft have shot down or destroyed over 220 enemy aircraft. Most of these enemy aircraft are large planes such as B24s, C45s, and C47s. Today, the number of aircraft and the actual strength of the pilots can almost absolutely determine the victory or defeat of the battle. In just two months, the enemy has lost over 500 pilots, and their predicament is impossible to hide. Since the bombing unit bombed Chittagong on October 20th, they have hardly encountered a challenge from enemy aircraft. When Calcutta was attacked on December 5th, although enemy aircraft were expected to challenge them, you engaged over 60 Hurricane aircraft and P51 enemy aircraft, but hundreds of enemy fighters stood idly by. It was not until the bombing of Tinsukia that there was a frontal air battle. In 30 minutes of combat, 16 enemy aircraft were shot down. The weakness of the enemy air force is becoming increasingly apparent. In other battles on the India-Burma border, enemy aircraft would take off and flee whenever they were bombed by Japanese aircraft, with no will to fight. In order to cope with the fierce bombing of Japanese aircraft, the enemy even mobilized units that were supplying Chongqing. In late November, a formation of dozens of fighter-bombers attacked Rangoon several times. The commander of an enemy B24 squadron was shot down by Japanese aircraft in a certain area, and the commander was captured, but he did not know the names of the members of the aircraft's crew. This proves that after they came to India from the United States, they were ordered to bomb Burma and had no time to know the names of the local pilots. It was not until they were captured that they exchanged names, which is an unbelievable phenomenon. Recently, the air route from the US mainland, across South America and Natal in Brazil, across the Great Atlantic, through Cairo, and arriving at Karachi is also not going well. The supply route connecting mainland China and India can only be used for guerrilla actions due to the threat of Japanese aircraft. At the same time, Japanese aircraft have been active everywhere since the end of the rainy season, while enemy aircraft have no operational plan at all. This is evidence that the enemy has no consistent operational purpose in the air war over Burma. Although the enemy has expanded its propaganda, the weakness of the enemy air force has been exposed. They are now carrying out blind bombing to disrupt the peace in Burma.</p>

<h3>Japanese Expeditionary Force in China Announces Weekly War Situation: Continued Sweeping Operations in Various Locations</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – The press department of the Expeditionary Force in China announced the weekly war situation on the 24th, stating that after defeating the Chinese forces that reinforced Changde twice on the Hunan-Hubei front, the Japanese forces in Central China are continuing to carry out sweeping operations in various locations. In addition to attacking a strong unit of Chinese forces that attacked north of Yangguan on the 16th, and surrounding several hundred Chinese forces that attacked Yiyangguan, they also launched surprise attacks on the 10,000-strong 185th Division of the Chinese army and the 118th and 11th Divisions of the Chinese army in the vicinity of Pengjiafan (40 kilometers west-southwest) and the area southwest of Nuanshui Street on the 17th and 18th. They also encircled them near the Bianhe River and are currently engaged in annihilation battles. On the other hand, since the beginning of December, Japanese forces in Dangyang, Xinyang, and Yichang have attacked the Chinese forces under Li Zongren of the 5th War Area, who were attempting to rescue the 6th War Area, and achieved great results, leaving behind approximately 800 Chinese corpses. In North China, in addition to achieving great results, punitive expeditions are being implemented at any time. Furthermore, Japanese army air units, in addition to continuously cooperating closely with ground forces, intercepted over 40 American fighter-bombers that attacked Guangdong on the afternoon of the 23rd, shooting down 14 of them and effectively hitting 7 or 8 enemy (P-47) aircraft, causing them to flee. They also flew to attack American air force bases in Chongqing, Kunming, Yunnan, Guilin, Hengyang, Changsha, and other places on the 18th, 19th, 21st, and 22nd, shooting down 42 enemy aircraft and destroying 31.

<h3>Central News Agency Correction</h3>
<p>Regarding the news about the Ministry of Finance's special consumption tax collection, the section stating that the tax rate would be 30% to 41% does not match the facts. Furthermore, the implementation date has not yet been determined. We hereby make this correction. Central News Agency.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles on the Road to Rome; Germans Defend Ortona on the East Coast</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to combined front-line reports, fierce battles are currently taking place in the triangular area formed by Venafro, Cassino, and Alfedena in Italy. Cassino is the main road directly to Rome, while Alfedena is a roundabout route to Rome. American troops have already entered Alfedena, while Cassino is still in German hands. It is reported that news received here from Algiers states that the American commando unit in the Liri River operations has approached Ortona on the Adriatic coast, which has become the central battlefield. The battle for the city is still fierce. According to a Reuters correspondent, the German defenses in the city are such that all buildings are secretly equipped with machine gun nests and sniper positions. Ortona is full of traps and mines, and the Germans have also deployed a strong elite paratrooper unit, further strengthening the city's defenses.</p>
<h3>British Troops Reportedly Land on Portuguese Madeira Island</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to rumors circulating in Lisbon, the British Navy has landed on Madeira Island, intending to occupy it. (Note: Madeira Island is located in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Morocco.) However, Portuguese officials have not confirmed the news. The rumor also states that Prime Minister Churchill is staying on the island for winter rest and recuperation.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Fortifications on the Northern Islands</h3>
<p>The northernmost end of Japan's defense line, the Kuril Islands in winter, is now covered in wind and clouds. In the days to come, silver clouds hang low, snowflakes flutter, and the mournful cold wind blowing across the Sea of Okhotsk scatters across every island. Trees several meters tall are buried deep under the snow. Except for the faint black of pine trees on the mountains, it is a world of silver powder. Braving this biting wind and snow, the Japanese army is vigilantly guarding every moment, actively building strong bases, and silently continuing the glorious results of the southern war.</p>
<p>The United States, with all its strength, is constantly launching large-scale naval and air offensives in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Gilbert Islands. In the Aleutian Islands, the enemy's offensive has only consisted of two air raids on August 12th and September 12th. Since then, for about three months, a calm before the storm has been maintained.</p>
<p>However, even though the war situation is so calm, they still do not abandon their dream of invading the north. Since capturing Attu Island, they have been actively engaged in building forward bases and are extremely active. Coming from the Aleutian Islands, islands such as Attu, Kiska, Semichi, Adak, Amchitka, Gareloi, and Ulak are being prepared as forward bases, linking the rear bases of Dutch Harbor, Kodiak, etc., creating a powerful northern invasion route. They are armed with a fleet of six to seven hundred heavy bombers of North American B-25, Consolidated B-24, Boeing B-17, and PBY types, as well as fighter groups, waiting for an opportunity to strike from the north. Currently, apart from two special aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and some other ships, there is no movement of ships in that area. As for ground forces, part of them have been withdrawn since the landing on Kiska Island. That area, including Alaska, has a total of six divisions on standby. Japan is exerting silent pressure.</p>
<p>The Enemy Will Inevitably Attack Sooner or Later</p>
<p>It is impossible to predict when the United States, which hopes to determine the outcome with a short-term decisive battle, will turn its sharp edge to the northern invasion route. However, the United States, with its massive manpower and weapons, is waiting for an opportunity to attack the Japanese mainland directly from the Aleutian Islands, parallel to its offensives in the central and southern Pacific. This is expected from the recent new offensive on the Gilbert Islands. If the United States wants to conquer the North Pacific, it must start by occupying Shumshu Island in the Kuril Islands. If they occupy Shumshu Island, they can advance south from the Kuril Islands and attack Hokkaido. The enemy wants to set up air bases for fighters and bombers that are strategically advantageous. From this point of view, they must first seek a foothold here. The enemy will likely attack by first landing large-scale paratrooper units and tank groups. In this way, the North Pacific front may erupt at any time. In the silence of the northern Kuril Islands, a tense atmosphere is lingering.</p>
<p>Fortifying All the Kuril Islands</p>
<p>The Kuril Islands stretch north in an arc, like a breakwater preventing the fury of the North Pacific. They naturally play a major role in defending the Japanese mainland. Due to the provisions of the 1922 Washington Treaty limiting Pacific defenses, they were completely left as undefended areas. However, in the short years since the establishment of forward bases on Kiska and Attu Islands, each island in the Kuril Islands has been transformed into a large base at an alarming rate. Now, strong iron chains linking the fortresses are firmly guarding the far left end of the Greater East Asia defense line against the inevitably attacking enemy.</p>
<p>"The Kuril Islands are Japanese territory, and we cannot allow the United States to set foot on them." This is the consistent belief of all the officers and soldiers defending the Kuril Islands. The goal of defending the Kuril Islands is to defeat the attacking enemy in the sea, to decimate those who escape this fate on the shore, and to absolutely prevent them from landing. Therefore, day and night, they continue the intense work of building bases. As a result, on islands that originally had no roads, winding motor roads meander between mountains, and vast airfields have been opened up in the frozen soil, which was originally a forest of shrubs and dwarf trees. Large cannons are watching the distant North Pacific, where clouds and smoke mingle. The terrain of the Kuril Islands is changing day by day.</p>
<p>The Hardships of the Garrisoned Soldiers</p>
<p>One clear day, the reporter went to inspect the construction of the airfield. The white clouds covering the vast airfield reflected the sunlight, dazzling the eyes. In the air, formations of aircraft patrolled, their silver wings flashing. Construction materials were bustling around. The sounds of triangular huts being assembled and entrenchments being built pierced the sky. The construction of the base, taking advantage of the clear weather, was full of the spirit of struggle.</p>
<p>On the way back from inspecting the airfield, at the suggestion of the unit commander, I stayed overnight in the dormitory. The so-called dormitory was a tent, scattered sparsely across the snow. As a result of focusing on building roads, airfields, and warehouses in the northern Kuril Islands, the barracks were not given attention. Only recently has the rapid construction of barracks begun, so there are still units living in tents.</p>
<p>The tent is a conical canopy, with only a support pole in the center, dug into the ground. A brazier is placed inside. The ground is covered with pine needles and grass. If there are no pine needles or grass, mats are laid directly, with a layer of waterproof cloth as a mattress, and then several blankets are used as a sleeping place. So dry land is fine, but if it is slightly damp, things inside the tent will become moldy due to the moisture. After the brazier goes out, it is extremely cold and impossible to sleep.</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers in the Kuril Islands, who are certain that the enemy will attack, are determined to "defend the sacred soil of the Divine Land," and are filled with the fighting spirit of "avenging Attu Island." Despite the snow and wind, they continue strict training and the construction of fortifications without any slack. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, December 10th)</p>

<h3>Preparing to Issue Gold Bars for the Purchase Price of Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Central Reserve Bank Scheduled to Issue in January Next Year</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Regarding the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai, the regulations have been promulgated by the Executive Yuan and are being handled by the National Commerce Control Commission. For all special fixed-term deposit certificates of the Central Reserve Bank that are due to be paid for the purchase price, a quarter of the face value of the Central Reserve Bank deposit certificates for the portion of the yarn and cloth that has already been inspected and accepted will be issued in gold bars in January next year. Furthermore, in consideration of the merchants' difficulties, for the portion that has not been inspected and accepted, after reviewing the application content, the Central Reserve Bank may issue temporary deposit certificates so that gold bars can be issued at the same time. However, these temporary deposit certificates should be exchanged for formal deposit certificates with a definite value from the Central Reserve Bank after the association completes the inspection and acceptance and determines the purchase price. As for the amount of gold bars paid for the first time based on this temporary deposit certificate, any excess or deficiency may be made up or deducted when the gold bars are issued for the second time. In this way, a large number of gold bars will suddenly increase on the market, and all past rumors will naturally be dispelled.</p>
<p>Method of Calculating the Price of Uninspected Cotton Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>For yarn and cloth that have not yet been inspected and for which the Cotton Industry Administration Office has issued custody certificates, the original applicant is responsible for safekeeping. The method of calculating the price is that the applicant is allowed to deduct the reserved quantity and the exempted quantity, and then fill in the price according to the standards set in the price assessment table. The Cotton Industry Administration Office of the association will issue a temporary payment certificate for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. After the calculation is completed, a contract will be signed to exchange for a special fixed-term deposit certificate exchange certificate, which can be used to collect the deposit certificate. However, in order to prevent abuses, it is stipulated that the applicant must be fully responsible for the goods in their custody. If any shortages, damages, or substandard varieties are found during future inspections, the difference should be calculated and deducted from the price. It is now heard that the association will affix the stamp "Inspection Not Completed" on the amount filled in on the special fixed-term deposit certificate exchange certificates issued to the applicants and on the notification letters to the reserve bank for households whose inspection has not been completed. After the inspection is completely completed in the future, the amount will be readjusted and a letter will be sent to the reserve bank to exchange for another deposit certificate. The above method has already been sent by the association to the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank for verification and implementation.</p>
<h3>Captain Shiota Talks About the Battle Achievements of the Shibasaki Unit: Heroic Sacrifice is Admirable</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Allied Fleet Reporting Department held a regular press conference at the Shanghai Naval Club on the Bund No. 3 at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 24th). Minister Matsushima was returning to the country on official business and Captain Yida spoke on his behalf. He described in detail the heroic fighting and martyrdom of the Shibasaki unit and military dependents of the Allied Marine Corps who guarded Tarawa Island and Makin Island with a small force against a large enemy, causing the enemy to suffer huge losses. The original words are as follows:</p>
<p>Worthy of Song and Tears</p>
<p>The heroic battle and martyrdom of the Shibasaki unit on Tarawa and Makin Islands not only moved the entire country, but this kind of battle situation is worthy of admiration by all mankind. The heroic battle situation of Japanese soldiers and military dependents has had this spirit for two hundred years, and the battles on these two islands are a concrete manifestation of this spirit of our Marine Corps. At the time, the Shibasaki unit guarded the two islands with only a small force of three thousand, while the enemy attacked with a crowd of fifty thousand, using hundreds of amphibious tanks and fierce shelling. Our Shibasaki unit remained unyielding and resisted to the end, fighting against an enemy dozens of times larger than us, and supported for as long as five days. They did not ask for help during the support, and sent a telegram saying: "Although our ammunition is exhausted and there is no reinforcements, our morale is strong and unusually excited," etc. Even the 1,500 members of the garrison unit on the two islands, although they were military dependents, would continue to work as usual when enemy shells fell. This kind of courage, although they are not soldiers, their spirit is like that of soldiers. Moreover, there are those who are better than soldiers. Among them, the garrison unit used tools as weapons to fight the enemy, which is even more worthy of song and tears.</p>
<p>American Losses</p>
<p>The martyrdom of the Shibasaki unit caused the American army to suffer great losses. According to the American army in Hawaii: The example set by the Japanese officers is truly admirable. Due to the above-mentioned battle results, we can imagine how difficult it must be for the American army to acquire these islands. The Pacific is not just the two islands of "Tarawa" and "Makin." There are many more islands. The American army has already exhausted a great deal of losses in acquiring these two islands. If they want to approach the Japanese mainland, they will have to sacrifice millions more manpower. "Due to the heroic sacrifice of the Shibasaki unit on Tarawa and Makin Islands, the degree of national enemy hatred among the Japanese people has increased even more." He also said: "Commander Shibasaki served as Chief of Staff of the Marine Corps in Shanghai a year and a half ago. When he talked with us, we could tell that he was intelligent and full of attacking spirit. He also had outstanding battle achievements when he fought on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines."</p>
<p>Contributions in Shanghai</p>
<p>It is heard that when Major General Shibasaki died in battle, the Chinese people in Shanghai also mourned deeply. The contributions of Shibasaki to Shanghai are unforgettable. I will describe them in detail below: The matters of civilian air defense in this city were also proposed by Shibasaki at that time. Now, the promotion of civilian air defense in Shanghai is like the division of cells, progressing day by day. Although the Baojia organization in this city was not created by Commander Shibasaki alone, he worked diligently to curb the activities of thugs. At the same time, in order to perfect the Baojia system, Shibasaki personally provided guidance from time to time. Even today, the water Baojia has been established. At the same time, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, Commander Shibasaki was very organized in handling enemy property, etc.</p>
<h3>The Federation of Industry and Commerce and Others Give a Farewell Tea Party to Secretary Iwai Today Afternoon</h3>
<p>Secretary Iwai of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy is about to leave for a new post. The Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association will hold a tea party at the Conference Hall of the Federation of Industry and Commerce in the Asia Building at 5:00 PM today (the 25th) to bid him farewell. The atmosphere at that time will definitely be enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquettes Rationed; Sales Begin on the 27th; One Catty Can Be Purchased With Rice Ticket No. 53</h3>
<p>According to the announcement of the First District Office of the Shanghai Special City, from December 27th of this year to January 3rd of next year, each retail coal briquette store may sell coal briquettes with rice purchase certificate No. 53.

This announcement does not apply to the territories that have recently been merged into this district.</p>
<h3>The New Federation Held a Editorial Committee Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Banning Opium, Gambling, and Dancing</h3>
<p>In order to respond to the movement to ban opium, gambling, and dancing and to discuss expanding publicity, the Shanghai News Federation held its fifth Editorial Committee meeting at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon on the fourth floor of the Xingya Building on the Bund. Member Ren Yunpeng, representing Xun Cheng, reported on the situation of convening discussions to respond to the movement. Chu Baochong, Wang Ping, Jiang Yunzhang, Chen Ying, Pan Leshan and others expressed many opinions on the movement to ban opium, gambling, and dancing. The final conclusions were: 1. Unanimously pass the movement to ban opium, gambling, and dancing. 2. Strengthen the publicity of banning opium, gambling, and dancing. 3. Emphasize the harm of opium, gambling, and dancing to the country and the people. 4. Request the government to ban opium, gambling, and dancing within a time limit. 5. Hope that the municipal government will implement the plan to ban gambling within the year and implement the ban on opium, gambling, and dancing at the same time.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service Held Yesterday for Slain Police Officers in the Eighth District</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: On the 19th of this month, a bloody incident of conflict between the military and police occurred in front of the Gongwuhe Gate on Da Shanghai Road in the eighth district of the city. The eight officers who died on the spot were Qi Jingyang, Chief of the Police Defense Section of the Taishan Branch, Xue Derun, Police Sergeant, Yan Delin, Zeng Yinnian, Zhu Guilin, Jin Zhengya, and Russian officers Miloguv and Sasduv. The First Police Bureau organized a funeral committee for the slain police officers to handle the aftermath and funeral arrangements. The memorial service was held at the International Funeral Home at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Secretary-General Zhao represented the municipal government to pay tribute. Because Director Chen of the First Bureau was in Beijing on official business, Deputy Director Su Chengde presided over the memorial service as the representative. Luo Junqiang, Chief of the Central Tax Police Corps, also went to pay tribute. Lu Ying, Director of the Second Police Bureau, and representatives from various bureaus, offices, and associations under the municipal government, Baojia organizations throughout the city, the Citizens' Welfare Association, Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce (Cheng Zhiliang, Acting), and various trade associations also went to pay tribute. Senior officials such as the chiefs of each branch of the First Bureau and the chiefs of each section and office led the police officers to participate in the public memorial service. There were thousands of people attending the memorial service and many elegiac couplets and wreaths were received from all sides.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Such Wartime Life</h3>
<p>Last night was "Christmas Eve." Some Jesus believers, as well as non-believers who consider themselves fashionable, regarded it as an opportunity to enjoy themselves and revel all night long. The article "Liquidation of Luxurious Nights" published in this newspaper is a completely factual report. We will list a few comparisons:</p>
<p>The first comparison: Isn't the Greater East Asia front at war? Loyal soldiers, born to die, are fighting to win the freedom and liberation of all the ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, but the rear is so extravagant and depraved. What are they thinking?</p>
<p>The second comparison: Aren't those who are sleeping on the streets, without clothes or food, also compatriots with round heads and square feet? Winter relief donations are made with the utmost effort, but they are unwilling to open their wallets; while dancing halls and brothels spend thousands of gold coins without stinginess. What are they thinking?</p>
<p>The third comparison: The price of rice, coal briquettes, and general commodities is rising day and night, and most citizens are worried about it and cannot survive. But the revelers sing and dance, ecstatic and forgetting themselves. What are they thinking?</p>
<p>The fourth comparison: The power company is restricting electricity consumption due to the difficulty in obtaining coal briquettes. Even production enterprises and social groups are no exception. But on the night of revelry, the lights are brilliant, like daylight. What are they thinking?</p>
<p>We can't help but suspect that all the extravagance and waste seem to be tacitly approved by the authorities.</p>
<p>Such participation in the war! Such wartime life!</p>
<p>Soon it will be "New Year's Day" and "Spring Festival" again, all with faces of revelry. We hope that the authorities will have a crackdown to make it right.</p>
<p>Comments from the Economic Circle</p>
<h3>Sanctioning Those Who Lead Price Increases</h3>
<p>In recent years, the prices of all commodities in Shanghai have risen in a straight line, without stopping. And each time there is a so-called leader. The initial leader of price increases was the exchange rate of the legal tender, due to the contraction of foreign exchange, the prices of imported goods rose, and the rise in the prices of imported goods led to a related rise in the prices of domestic goods. When foreign exchange was controlled, the next leader of price increases was the rise in the price of gold. Those who had goods used the rise in the price of gold as an excuse for raising the price of their goods. When gold was controlled, the next leader of price increases was the rise in the price of rice. Those who had goods used the rise in the price of rice as an excuse for raising the price of their goods. When rationed household rice and black market rice prices fell, the next leader of price increases was the rise in black market cotton yarn and cloth prices. Those who had goods used the rise in clothing prices as an excuse for raising the price of their goods. After cotton yarn and cloth were nationalized, the prices were stagnant and there was not much of a price increase for nearly three months. The next leader of price increases was the restriction of electricity and the rise in the price of coal briquettes. Those who had goods again used the rise in fuel prices as an excuse for raising the price of their goods. After this, it is not known what factors will lead to a general rise in prices again.</p>
<p>People's hearts are most restless in wartime, and any slight disturbance can make them feel insecure, so everywhere is enough to become an excuse for merchants to raise prices and make profits. The way to prevent this is to increase the production of materials and dredge the sources of materials. If there are still those who lead price increases, then we should cut the weeds and remove the roots so that they will never have room to operate.</p>
<h3>Oil and Grain Commission Investigates Purchase Situation in Various Places</h3>
<p>The Oil and Grain Professional Committee of the National Commerce Control Commission is making unremitting efforts to collect edible oil and oil pressing raw materials. In order to understand the situation in various producing areas, the committee has specially prepared survey forms and asked the federations of edible oil industries in various regions to order their respective industry associations to report truthfully according to the forms. The contents of the forms are the quantity and price of peanut oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, and rapeseed oil that can be purchased, with the date ending in May next year.</p>
<h3>Egg Professional Department May Be Formally Established</h3>
<p>Eggs are also one of the main commodities, which are closely related to people's livelihood. In recent years, due to the failure to establish an egg control organization, the production and sales parties have failed to coordinate reasonably, and the selling price has also been rising endlessly. In order to thoroughly control the industry, the National Commerce Control Federation is preparing to establish a general egg professional department. Its regulations have been passed by the joint meeting of directors and supervisors, and the organization and personnel are being carefully considered by the parties concerned, and it is expected to be formally established next year.</p>
<h3>Out-of-Exchange Trading of Chinese Stocks Ultimately Small Due to Tight Credit</h3>

<p>Our Newspaper Investigation</p>
<h3>Liquidation of Luxurious Night: A Fact Provided for Everyone to Discuss</h3>
<p>Last night was "Christmas Eve." The entire Shanghai entertainment scene went crazy all night, reveling in festivities and forgetting what era they were in. Here, we conducted an investigation to settle the accounts:</p>
<p>Christmas dinner per person ranged from 100 yuan to 600 yuan. The Gold Valley Hotel started at 200 yuan, the New Capital Hotel started at 300 yuan, the Jingan Cafe was 300 yuan, the International Skyscraper was 400 yuan, the Paramount was 500 yuan, and the France was 600 yuan.</p>
<p>Paramount Ballroom entrance tickets were 100 yuan, the International Skyscraper was 100 yuan, and the France was 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Drinks in first-class dance halls, a cup of plain tea, Lido was 80 yuan, the same for men and women. The New Celestial Forest, Metropolis, and Ciro's all sold for 100 yuan, each offering paper hats and toys. Second-class dance halls such as the MGM, Vienna, and Cathay ranged from 60 yuan to 100 yuan. A cup of coffee at MGM cost 120 yuan.</p>
<p>Around 9 o'clock, Lido closed its doors, and dancers fought each other over entry and seating.</p>
<p>Each dance hall was packed, truly a sea of people, with those who couldn't get in lingering.</p>
<p>Each dance hall arranged seats in three-quarters of the dance floor, and although the dancers were like sardines, they were satisfied.</p>
<p>The stoves in the Russian bars were blazing, the water heaters in the MGM were warm, and other places were also filled with spring. The electric lights were as bright as day. Who said coal was difficult to obtain? Who said there were electricity restrictions?</p>
<p>It is said that each dance hall operated all night. Was this specially approved by the Bureau of Regulations?</p>
<p>Dancers and diners wore high-nosed and short-bearded masks or paper flower hats, dancing and shouting joyfully. Perhaps they would be embarrassed to revel without masks!</p>
<p>From the intersection of Jingan Temple Road and Mohawk Road to the New World, cars were parked continuously along the roadside, mostly gasoline-powered cars, truly the propertied and leisurely class!</p>
<p>Let's have another small statistic. The first-class dance halls, Paramount, Lido, Metropolis, New Celestial Forest, and Ciro's, each accommodated an average of 2,000 people. Drinks, meals, and seat tickets cost 1,000 yuan per person, and each business made 2 million yuan. The five businesses made 10 million yuan. Adding the second and third-class dance halls, bars, cafes, and hotels, the total consumption in one night was estimated at over 50 million yuan. Although this statistic is not very accurate, we believe it is very close to the truth.</p>
<p>A rickshaw puller told me that he earned 1,300 yuan in five hours, which cannot be said to be a Christmas gift.</p>
<p>In this era, with such facts, is it reasonable or not? Whose responsibility is it? Let everyone discuss!</p>

<h3>A Hospital on Luoyang Road: Visiting Shanghai Nanyang Hospital</h3>
<p>Secondly, if patients have made considerable contributions to society, the nation, or even the country, or are employees of the above-mentioned institutions and are indeed in poverty, all their expenses will be borne by the hospital. For example, the previous response to Shenbao's preferential treatment for primary school teachers is one such example. However, for general poor patients, it is believed that this is an important part of social problems and should be fundamentally addressed by the authorities and society working together. The hospital's expenses have no external assistance. Although it has tried its best to help, it still deeply regrets not being able to fulfill its wishes. As for implementing epidemic prevention injections every summer, providing free medical treatment for children every Children's Day, and undertaking charitable organizations and other social groups' voluntary services, it has always been unwilling to lag behind.</p>
<p>A New Ideal in the Chinese Medical Community</p>
<p>China's population is said to be 450 million, but how many new medical talents are there? Although there are no accurate statistics, it seems there are definitely not enough 100,000 doctors. Then, on average, there is only one Western doctor for every 4,500 people! Compared with contemporary countries, what an alarming ratio! Then, what practical significance is there to protecting national health and developing medical services every day? Therefore, in today's Chinese medical community, an extremely important task has been put forward, namely, training and cultivating a large number of scientific medical talents.</p>
<p>The original motivation for establishing Shanghai Nanyang Hospital was to cultivate new medical talents. For more than 20 years, it is said that this task has never been neglected for a single day. The first is the daily research work of the hospital's doctors and nurses. In the medical department, there are regular case discussion meetings, specializing in discussing clinical records and difficult case reviews by interns and resident doctors. It is also stipulated that a clinical review be held once a week, that is, to review and discuss all difficult and doubtful cases, with each doctor expressing their opinions, stating theories, and conducting theoretical and practical research. In addition to the above-mentioned regular mutual exchanges and discussions, there is also the organization of a medical affairs committee, whose main goal is to connect the feelings between doctors, research academic knowledge, promote hospital affairs, and assist in the training of medical staff.</p>
<p>The educational work of the nursing department is even more intense, centered on the Nanyang Hospital Senior Nursing Vocational School. The school's teachers are specially hired from various well-known nursing schools, and the directors of each department of the hospital are also responsible for explaining relevant medical courses. This semester's students number 63, all of whom have a junior high school education level, and some have above junior high school level. It is said that in order to improve nursing education in the future, it is hoped that high school graduates will be admitted. As for the curriculum, it is completely in accordance with the curriculum standards of the Chinese Nursing School Senior Nursing Vocational School. The academic term is stipulated as a probationary period of half a year and a regular study period of three years. Those who achieve a score of 70 or above in each subject during the probationary period can join the regular study class. In addition to attending classes in the classroom, students also practice clinically in various wards and outpatient clinics. Each ward has two head nurses responsible for guiding students, so that they have sufficient knowledge and practical experience. Each student works in the ward for eight hours, and in addition to clinical nursing, they are also responsible for health care, disease prevention, and health guidance. The supervisors leading the nurses also hold monthly meetings to report on the work of each ward and discuss how to seek progress together, cultivating students' habits of independent research and work. Extracurricular activities include ball sports and concerts.</p>
<p>General medical staff also pay attention to daily continuing education within the scope of the general affairs department. In terms of work, the three-eight system is adopted, and staff and workers are divided into day and night shifts to work in rotation. Their continuing education activities include reading groups, concerts, and ball teams. The hospital workers also have newspaper reading classes and compulsory continuing education groups, implemented in three groups. Every hospital, except on Sundays, stipulates that classes are held from 7 to 9 o'clock, divided into Mandarin, simple foreign language, hygiene common sense, current affairs, stories, etc., to provide opportunities for advancement.</p>
<p>Dr. Gu said that in addition to working hard in their respective positions, serving patients, and striving to assist the poor, sick, and elderly, the hospital also strives to engage in other related social undertakings, in order to contribute to the liberation of the nation. He believes that the Chinese people's understanding of scientific medicine, like other scientific departments, has not yet been fully understood, and that research on the country's inherent medicine, especially Chinese medicine, lacks scientific methods, which is a major obstacle to the future development of the nation. Therefore, he believes that every scientific medical scholar and pharmaceutical entrepreneur today must start from here and open up a broad road for the nation's scientific medicine. He said that Nanyang Hospital will focus on increasing beds for the poor and sick in response to the actual situation and needs of the country and society, promoting disease prevention movements, and especially concentrating more effort on cultivating and training medical talents. In the past three years, they have focused on this, regardless of whether they are graduates of Xiehe, Tongde, or other medical colleges, in order to provide them with internship opportunities before formally practicing. They have long accepted a large number of them for training, painstakingly cultivating talents for the country and society. Apart from the Chinese Red Cross Hospital, perhaps only they are doing such hard work at the cost of sacrifice. However, they believe that before the country undertakes such undertakings on a large scale, it is best for socially far-sighted and ambitious capitalists to come out and cooperate, expanding their medical talent cultivation and training business through investment. Then, the hospital's success in the future will also be the success of the investors, and the contribution to the future of society, the nation, and the country will be truly immeasurable.</p>
<p>"Social undertakings should be made public to society, and powerful people in society should resolutely stand up and support excellent social undertakings." After saying goodbye to Nanyang Hospital, I deeply felt this saying. (End)</p>

<h3>Christmas Day Benefits the Elderly with Old Age Assistance Funds</h3>
<p>— Huang Jingwan</p>
<p>Since the initiation of the Old Age Assistance Fund, it has received enthusiastic support from all walks of life. Taking advantage of the Christmas holiday, 34 elderly people, including 96-year-old Fang Zhu, were each given 100 yuan, and seven homes for orphaned and poor elderly and elderly care groups in various Christian churches were given a total of 2,000 yuan, expressing a token of respect. However, there are many elderly people suffering from the bitter cold and hidden impoverished everywhere. The small amount is not enough for distribution. I hope that all sectors will donate more enthusiastically. Yesterday, Mr. Feng Zhizhi generously supported us, and Zhongde Hall donated 3,500 yuan. This is to express our gratitude.</p>
