<p>社評</p>
<h3>決戰生活的實踐</h3>
<p>前幾天東條首相在日本中央協力決戰會議中發表演說，要求一億日本國民實踐決戰生活，以進而團結束亞十億民衆，切實協力爭取戰爭的最後勝利。我們讀到這篇演詞，觸發起無窮的感喟。</p>
<p>老實說，日本國民，從戰爭以來，早已在政府的領導之下，步入戰時生活的正軌，在上旣有各種策勵戰時生活的法規與領導組織，使嚴格的禁制與政治的誘導同時並進，在下更有種種民間性的組織，自警自肅，以期國民生活，完全符合政府作戰之意圖與要求。無論精神上或物質上，他們都不希望自居於法令之外，苟圖自由，苟免節制。他們這種一億一心的犧牲精神，完全是爲了矢忠於政府與國家，也完全表示國民對於國　及戰爭的信心。然而，他們並不以此爲滿足，在這世界戰爭逐日逼近決戰階段的今日，他們史在「實踐決戰生活」的中心目標之下，加倍抑制國民的日常生活，向「淸新簡紫」之途邁進。無論在食·衣·住·行以及精神生活方面，更進一步的要求大家力自尅制，忍耐苦痛，以便集中一億的心力能力與物力，積蓄戰力，在未來決戰中奠定必勝的基礎。爲着保衛東亞，保障東亞十億人民之解放自由，日本人民忍受着種種痛苦，擔任着最艱鉅的重任，每一個中國人民，必然會因此感到慚愧的！</p>
<p>在大決戰的階段，中國所處地位之重要，毫無疑問，中國人民能否擔負起自己應有的責任而無魏於友邦及東亞其他民族，就看我們的日常生活如何而定。實際上我們國民的生活，這幾年來，除了大部份受戰事影響而被動地陷於非常艱苦之境地以外，積極地自主地鑒於自己之責任而肅正其生活的，可說是還不多見。就大體說，無論貧富或中等階級，能够鑒於時勢之艱難與國家的榮辱而自動地改變其生活狀態，以所有心力物力獻給國家的，我們簡直還很少看到。我們會經再三倡導實行戰時生活，但是至今還只有少數社會領袖和實業界一部份知名人士開始實踐，上海的奢侈浪費情形，依然如舊，看看別國國民生活之「淸新簡素」，再自顧現狀，能不感到慚愧？</p>
<p>我們認爲實踐決戰生活的運勁，在中國特別是在上海，必須迅速切實的推行。首先就應該限制不正當的娛樂塲所，以及茶樓酒家的營業，限制水電的供應及其營業時間。同時，除了國民必需的飲食店與適合戰時需要的正當娛樂塲所以外，必須厲行徵收重稅，但此種所得，必須用以救濟無衣無食的難民及興辦公益事業與社會敎育事業。</p>
<p>在衣食方面，一方面固然需要當局之指導，明定戰時生活標準，另一方面，尤在一般國民思想之啟蒙。一般人依據歷來相傳的習慣，有種種錯誤的觀念與成見，譬如食糧，都迷信米，不信雜糧的營養價値，我們希望科學家及專門家大家努力硏究，公佈各種食料的營養價植，推行吃雜糧及馬鈴薯等，以减少米榖的不足現象。又如上海一般人民，向愛以猪肉爲上餚，中等人家，以不食猪肉爲失面子，其實，猪肉的營養價値並不很高，一般人儘可不吃；相反的，猪肉還會傳染疾病，更從經濟的原則言，則爲了喂猪，不知奪去了多少貧苦人民的食糧，爲了物資節的，養猪亦應限制。</p>
<p>至於衣著方面，由於習慣，人人雖知「死要面子活受罪」，也不得不穿著品質優良的中西裝以及上等的鞋帽等等。無論在個人經濟上。健適上。工作便利上以及社會物質上，都是一種極不合理的現象。我們希望各業各界的領導人物，率先倡導，夏季西裝不穿上裝，不用帶結，如「香港衫」等即應視爲理想而合禮的夏季服裝，中裝則提倡布衣短衫，還有破衣破鞋，只要補綻整潔，即小失體面，且應受人尊敬。女子的華服盛裝，特別是奢華的飾物，應被視爲不正當職業女子的特殊標識，提倡質朴簡單的衣着，上行下效，社會風氣可以改善，國民經濟可以好轉，國家則可收節的物資之效。</p>
<p>我們在這裏必須特別指出的是，一方面必須立即推行實踐決戰國民生活運動，另一方面，就必須當局努力保障國民最低限度的生活，如食糧及日用品之低價配給制必須切實澈底。然後可以保證決戰生活運動的成功，並可消泯暴富極貧的社會矛盾與危機，於今後的復興與建設，實有英大的效益。</p>

<h3>日本中央協力會議　昨傍晚圓滿閉幕　全體一致通過「必勝誓文」</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　十六日爲日中央協力會議最後一日，上午八時再度召開全體大會，首由大本營陸軍報道部長谷萩少將及海軍報道部員田代中佐，詳細說明最折之軍事情勢，繼由小林議長說明全體議員爲表明決意，提議草擬爭取大東亞　爭最後勝利之「必勝誓文」，並即推舉起草委員草擬案文後，即全體一致通過，繼由委員長報告要求政府及翼贊會從　實行今日所通過之議案，常即由井况技術院總裁，岸商相，寺島遞相等分別就所管議　，依决發言，說明政府之態度與感想。嗣翼贊會本部方面，由丸岑事務總長，小干總務局長及石黑鍊成部長分別起立，參酌政府方面意向，力言重要提案，應從速實施，並說明翼贊會之今後運動方針。最後由小　議長裁奪並致詞，討論於此完畢，當即舉行閉慕典禮，由東　總裁致辭，至此決戰下意義深長之中英協力會議，乃即於十六日傍晚圓滿閉幕。</p>
<h3>谷萩部長詳述　各方面戰況　昂揚日一億國民決意</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本營陸軍報道部谷萩部長，十六日在中央協力會議總會中，詳細說明美國反攻之意圖及四南太平洋各方面之戰況，並昂揚日一億國民之決意、其原文如决：美國以「物質」「生產」「時間」爲戰爭勝利之三要素，然於物質力面所必要之種類與數量，頗不如意，生產方面因種種關係，至本年秋將達其飽和量，其後勢難再使此生產急速增加，然若與日本以相當時問，日本必愈加强其政戰兩略之態勢，故美國利用其最有利之今明年，企圖予日本以極大打擊，乃屬當然。羅斯福致議會之咨文中，亦曾謂一九四三年爲決戰之年，然欲對日實行反攻若干太平洋島嶼，則需相當歲月與莫大犧牲，此固屬非策，若以中途島及阿留申島爲基地，利用空軍空襲日本本土，則飛機之續航力又感不足，亦不濟事，若使航空母艦攻擊日本土，又實極危險，結果乃於接近日本之大陸上尋求基地，對日展開航空決戰，因此首須加强駐渝空軍，而此等補給僅可依存自印度之空輸路綫，測其每月之輸送量，不過千噸左右，頗不充分，故敵方不得巳而圖奪同緬甸，此奪同緬甸之作戰，非僅爲增大對日抗戰之渝方援助，及加强駐渝美空軍力量，且爲防衛印度之安全方策，當茲印度獨立運動聲勢正酣之際，此乃爲必然之趨勢。</p>
<p>美國遭逢最大危機</p>
<p>英印軍自去年末即已開始奪同緬甸之作戰，然經迭决之失敗，故其企圖全成泡影，如斯觀之，欲逼近日本本土愈成困難，然敵方決不因此困難而止於此，勢將設法於今明兩年內使戰力增至最大限度，作窮兵黷武之爭，然其間若無偉大戰果，則必引起一般國民之質問，如紐的泰晤士報華盛頓支局長柯羅克曾謂、美國內戰爭綫今巳遭遇開戰以來之最大危機，事實亦然，加之通貨膨脹對策之失敗，生活費用昂　，勞動糾紛頻發，食糧供給困難，官僚爭權奪利，及選舉大總統前之政爭等，故國內情勢極感不安。又反軸心國陣營內部之破綻、允未彌平，因此唯有以戰果求輿論之支援，維持對反軸心各國之信用，去年十一月英。美軍在北非登陸、其戰爭幸告成功，一時博得盛讚，其後該兩國首腦更在華府協議作戰之方針，結果大體以歐洲第一全義爲原則，同時圖乘機於太平洋方面對日展開積極攻勢。</p>
<p>表面援蘇實爲利己</p>
<p>綠美國本無積極救援蘇聯之眞意，惟使德·蘇兩敗俱傷，以收己利而巳，共於北非或西歐亦未獲得理想戰果，即今後之犧牲或亦無從獲償，故其認爲進攻歐洲之舉實爲非當。反顧東亞渝方日趨沒落，如不積極援助，結果或將脫離英·美。同時澳洲亦正懼於日軍進攻，祈望增援，因此美國爲遂其野心、正可藉此染指澳洲及印度，且可從事早即有意打倒日本之心願，因此美國乃倡太平洋第一主義，故縱使接受英國之歐洲第一主義，其實行之勢亦必異常冷淡，基於此美國乃於南太平洋方面發動反攻作戰。蓋此次美國於南太平洋方面之反攻，弁非暫時或局部性質者，實可視爲有具體計劃之大反攻作戰，美軍仍以貪求無窮，妄信物資取勝，對日本空軍戰力及其生產力亦仍估計過小，戰塲上之美軍，最初由於冒險心，獵奇心，英雄主義，　盜精神等心情，亦曾有相當强烈之鬥志，但此終爲一種兒嬉心，最交戰之初一敗塗地。</p>
<p>美方宣傳掩飾敗跡</p>
<p>美軍此次之反攻，正爲我方消滅敵人之絕好機會，毀滅其人方資源，破壞其依靠機械力及物質力之戰術，故此次反軸心軍之反攻作戰，一般有識之士成謂非「勝利利之爭賭」乃「瘋在之冒險」。茲略述此次美軍之反攻之槪况如决：自六月三十日以來，美强力之陸。海軍部隊即在所羅門眾島中之倫特巴島及新佐治亞島登陸，以孟達爲目標，繼續向前推進、駐守該處之日陸·海軍部隊，即奮勇邀擊，新幾內亞島方面，美軍一部於六月三十日在諾索灣登陸，另一部於薩爾斯方而北上進犯，此外，澳洲軍一部亦與此相呼應，於伯布他比及其東南方進擊我軍亦即經由薩拉磨亞附近邀擊，幷於本月五日於怕布他比地區奇　敵軍背後，悉使潰逃。此外，新幾內亞島東方未經我軍佔領之摩亞克留伊納兩島、似巳於本月一日前後爲美軍一部佔領，最初，美國對此次作戰，宣傳首先佔領拉巴爾，以此爲根據地，再推進遮斷日軍與莽島之聯絡，或用爲別方面新作戰之烟幕，但其作戰之進展，匪特未如其意，且蒙受極大之損害，故又僞稱此爲防衛澳洲，或爲攻略拉巴爾，只爲佔領與該處相近各地之根據地，更特對其國民申述此絕大之犧牲乃意中事，以圖掩飾敗跡。</p>
<h3>墨索里尼讚許　大東亞政策　日東條首相覆電致謝</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　　東條首相前在第八十二屆臨時議會席上，曾發表大東亞宣言，此在國際間引起莫大好感，尤以軸心各國無不一致深表歡迎。茲義大利首相墨索里尼，於八日以聲明書一通，託該國駐日大使轉交東條首相，內容大意謂：余爲稱贊東條大將政策中之一人，認爲此種政策爲解決東亞各種問題最適當之方策，睛將此意傳告東條大將。又江特拉鮑斯爲余之老友，深信其所着手進行之事業，必能完成，故援助鮑斯氏實爲當前之急務，亦請轉告大將閣下。日東條首相接獲該函後，即於十六日訓令日駐義日高大使函覆墨索里尼首相，大意謂：敝國爲解決東亞各種問題，所採取之政策，謬蒙讚許，並增余等軸心必勝之信念（中略），向義首相深致謝意。</p>
<p>南太平洋以外戰況</p>
<p>谷萩少將决復略述關於南太平洋以外各方面之戰况如次：緬甸方面，現雖巳屆雨季，但國境方面之英·印軍·仍不時以小規模部隊出擊，或以飛機從事擾亂後方，企圖奪囘該地。然經我軍隨時隨處將之擊退，故毫未得逞、英國任命華維爾爲印度總督，並新設東亞作戰司令部，以圖誇大聲勢，更謂攻克突尼斯後，將地中海方面之艦艇調遣至印度洋，準備俟雨季過後，實行新作戰，此亦我等所切盼者，俾使之重演如今春阿拉坎山脈馬猶河岸之醜劇。又自印度向渝方補助飛機一項仍繼續未停，駐渝美空軍自水月上旬天氣轉佳後，即再度開始蠢動，最近曾不斷盲炸漢口。廣州·越南·海防等處。阿留申方面之敵軍，自阿圖島戰後，似深爲日軍勇　之精神所鎭，但其欲奪同基斯加島之野心仍未减退，不時實行空襲或自海岸砲擊，但我守備隊確保該島，滅敵之士氣，極爲旺盛。</p>

<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本營報道部田代海軍中佐，今於日中央協力會議全體大會席間，就新佐治亞島，倫特巴島方面之戰局列舉事實，予以具體說明，以期促起日國民之最大決意，其辭謂，當六月中旬召開第八十二屆臨時議會時，海軍大臣旣曾對海軍戰况有所說明，故今日所談者，乃以新佐治亞島爲中心之戰鬥情形，該方面之日本基地有拉巴爾島及拉巴爾與瓜達康納爾島間之玻根維爾島，瓜達康納爾與拉巴爾間相距六百公里，拉巴爾與玻根納爾間相距三百公里，玻根維爾與瓜達康納爾島間之中央，有新佐治亞島，該島距瓜島爲百二十公里，其形如一黃瓜，西北有一荷葉形之哥倫班加拉島，兩島之距離寬處爲十五公里，狹處爲七公里，新佐治亞島島首之南部海岸有孟達港，孟達港南方的五公里有倫特巴島，其形如烟袋鍋，現在激戰之地，即以此新佐治亞·哥倫班加拉·倫特巴等爲中心。茲將六月三十日敵軍於倫特巴登陸前之情形略加說明，故自上旬後，即漸增强其空軍兵力，同時日方之空軍兵力亦已遂漸增加，雙方即相對峙，或互相轟炸對方航空基地，或互相破壞增援路綫，或作空中戰鬥，殆無日無之。因隨雙方空軍兵力之增加，故戰鬥亦日形激烈，進入六月後，日空軍曾迭炸瓜達康納爾之敵軍基地以及遙遠之新赫布里底，里特爾兩島之敵航空基地。此外且曾屢次攻擊平塞爾島以及龍加灣之敵軍大運輸船團，幷曾於聖特蘭上空與敵作壯烈空戰。另一方面敵軍亦曾屢决攻擊我方陣地航空基地以及地上部隊。六月後來襲敵機數目最多之日達七十架或百架以上，該方面新佐治亞島，哥倫班加拉島日陸，海軍地上部隊於敵軍之攻擊下以機槍擊落來襲敵機，此爲余在該地段親見親聞者，此與乘飛機直撞敵航空母艦實無二致。迨至六月三十晨，敵巡洋艦，驅逐艦，運輸船團等遂出現於倫特巴島西方，計自第一次所羅門海戰以來，敵於實行大規模登陸作戰時，每隨有大艦隊，同時即常展開大規模之海戰，而此次則與前不同，以登陸用舟艇及水上海軍數十艘，共的二百艘，滿載軍隊兵器彈藥，向倫特巴周圍而來，同時並以驅逐艦巡洋艦作主體，以爲護衛，我軍發見敵艦後，乃亦立即迎戰，所予敵軍之損害，已爲大本營所發表者，茲不再述其數字，但吾人試觀我方亦有三十一架飛機未曾歸還一事，當可知此次戰鬥如何激烈，以及我軍之如何忠勇，蓋此三十一架飛機之未歸，實僅决於去年南太平洋海戰時四十架飛機未歸還之大犧牲也，敵軍於倫特巴島登陸後，次日即自倫特巴島北方，進至新佐治亞南方孟達與倫特巴間一小島。爲魯比亞納島，該　方面，七月一日亦已發現敵蹤，至七月二日三日敵方曾以其一部兵力在孟達南方地區登陸，另一方面新佐治亞之中部南岸，亦有敵軍登陸，兩軍以倫特巴，魯比亞納島爲中心之激戰，其情彩即爲大本營所發表者，在前綫之我軍航空部隊，現正與水上艦艇或陸上部隊，取得緊密聯絡。以勇猛之攻擊精神，與敵交戰，對自倫特巴鳥南方進展之敵軍猛烈反攻。此外敵亦企圖於新佐治亞島西北方發動，因於本月四日晚至五日。突侵入新佐治亞島西北可倫班加拉島間之庫拉灣內，一部企圖向庫拉灣中之新佐治亞島西北岸，賴斯　及其內之拜洛可西方實行登陸，結果其於拜洛可方面，欲行登陸之一部，巳被擊退，是夜因該地我陸海軍地上部隊之大砲與水需戰隊，協力攻擊，首即擊沉敵艦三艘，决晚正從事作戰中之我驅逐艦數艘，又於可倫班加拉島之北方與由巡洋艦驅逐艦十餘艘組成之敵有力艦隊遭遇，我軀遂艦當即猛攻敵巡洋艦，旋擊沉其中一艘，另一艘亦中彈起火焚燒，此即如吾人　知過去在峇釐島海戰時，我驅逐艦擊敗敵方巡洋艦之戰事。水雷戰隊之奮勇無雙，故在庫拉灣夜戰中使敵大敗而退，其後敵仍積極於庫拉灣西北岸集結兵力，我陸海軍地上部隊對之即加以痛擊，此已於十二日由大本營發表，至此，敵始想及攻擊重點移於孟達灣。至十二日在庫拉灣方面之敵軍，再度企圖登陸，是夜敵四艘以上之巡洋艦部隊與我水雷戰隊，在可倫班加拉島海面遭遇，旋又展開激戰、結果擊沉或擊毀敵巡洋艦數艘，其後關於孟達方面之戰事，適巳於昨日發表，敵自魯亞比納島向孟達東方一帶登陸，另一部亦逼近孟達來攻，我軍見之加以猛擊，敵乃施放烟慕，但我陸海軍地上部隊即猛烈反攻，將敵擊退，敵損失舟艇廿餘艘，狼狽而逃。又是時巳先登陸之敵軍一部亦復攻來，結果亦被擊退，以上所述者，即以新佐治亞島爲中心，敵我空戰　戰以及地上部隊戰　，悲壯激烈之戰鬥情　也。</p>

<h3>王克敏在京　談華北近狀　昨由京飛滬</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　華北政治委員會委員長王克敏氏，於十六日上午十一時三十分，假國際俱樂部，接見首都巾外新聞記者發表談話，到各報社記者二十餘人，由華北政委會參事邵東湖，擔任翻譯，茲將王氏談話要旨，錄誌如下：現在華北有兩項最重要問題，（一）糧食，（二）治安，此兩問題，均有連帶關係，藍華北素非產米區域，關於糧食之供應，在事變前，即仰賴外埠輸入，事變後，糧食益惑缺乏，故最近華北稍有資產者，多食麥粉，中下階級則食雜糧，是以本人對食糧調節增產等問題，極爲注視，此事正由王蔭泰實業督辦積極努力設法，俾謀合理圓滿之具體辦法，而解決當前華北民食之恐慌。至於治安問題，華北治安，經數年來負責長官之努力，其成績已斐然可觀，最近華北政務委員會，更成立剿共委員會，各省市縣，亦成分別設立防共會，展開全面防共工作，期確保華北治安云。嗣記者提出（一）華北會務與中央之關係？（二）今後華北庶政措施有何新計劃？（三）對今後南北物資交流有何改進計劃？（四）東亞戰爭以迄東條首相發表對華新策有何感想？（五）中央華北一元化，其中不無因通貨之影響，現在華北政委會，對此有無具體辦法？（六）本年華北災情甚重，有無具體救濟辦法等問題。據王氏答稱：華北爲中央華北，華北政委會係屬國府統制下之機構，今後一切庶政措施、自當秉承中樞意旨辦理，至今後庶政推進問題，本人因視事伊始，對此尙無具體規劃，惟朱委員長已訂有很好計劃，本人自當蕭規曹隨，按照已定之計劃、參照實際情况與需要，謀逐次之推展與改進。關於今後南北物資交流問題、此點極關重要，本人今後將飭主管機關委擬具體適當辦法，墜南北物資得以圓滑交流。大東亞戰爭之爆發，實爲友邦日本謀東亞民族獨立解放之有力表現，國府參戰不僅表示與友邦同甘共苦之精神，亦爲我東亞民族團結協力之具體表現，余對束條首相發表施政演說，表示深刻之感謝與興奮，華北今後在中央領導之下，決與友邦同心戮力，共向完遂戰爭之途邁進。關於華北通貨問題，余正計劃考慮中，惟目前尙無具體辦法。至華北災情問題，蓋本年華北各地收成尙佳，平均約在五六成以上，並無實際災象，其主因在物資之缺乏耳，故本人今後主張謀南北物資之交流圓滑，俾華北不致有物資缺乏之恐慌，則民生自可安定。</p>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　華北政務委員會委員長王克敏，此次來京晋謁主席報告就職經過，並請示　宜後，連日拜會各有關機關酬酢頗忙，王氏祚京任務已畢，特於十六日午後三時，率同參事邵東　，乘機離京飛滬，預定在滬料理私事，的有二三　之逗留，再轉道返平。</p>

<h3>防物資偷運囤積　搜查已經着手　各地普設物資統制審議機構</h3>

<h3>山田上野兩氏　昨會晤雜誌界　蘄求中日文化交流進展</h3>
<p>（本報特訊）日本大東亞出版公司常務董事山田賺吉　大東亞出版文化硏究所理事上野巍兩氏，自日前來　後，連日酢酬頗忙，前日並由木報舉行茶會招待兩氏，介紹與本市新聞界人士會見，互相懇談，詳情業誌昨日本報，嗣本報以出版文化事業與雜誌界有不可分離之關係，且於中日文化交流上亦右重大意義，爰特再度於昨日下午五時假興亞大樓舉行茶會，介紹二氏與本市雜誌界同人相見，計到有山田上野兩氏，及雜誌界代表周瘦鵑·柳雨生·陶亢德·楊光政·葉德銘與雜誌聯合會代表任雲鵬等十餘人，席間由本報陳社長爲雜誌界代表一一介紹。</p>
<p>上野談話</p>
<p>繼由上野氏發表談話稱：水人等昨承申報陳社長介紹新聞界人士會見，今日又得與上　縛誌社代表聖首一堂，除感謝陳先生好意外，並感覺十分光榮、我人早知上海爲中國之文化中心，而各雜誌代表　君又屬雜誌界之佼佼者、故希望能聆取雜誌界權威人士所聞所見之高見藉得教益。在戰爭時期之今日，雜誌界諸君子已在本位上努力，而完成其使命實堪欽敬、願各位以寳貴之經騐：及其優越之成就，賜予指教，以爲本出版界雜誌界之南針。此次本人等來華，係考察貴國之文化出版事業，在滬任務完了後，即將轉赴南京，北京一帶視察，雖將與各位分別，但以後仍有機會見面，不過今日之機會不可多得，願在座諸公，各抒高見，及對日本雜誌界的期待者，我人當一一轉達與敝國人民及文化界人士。最後並述及去年東京文學者大會開幕時、因公他適未及與中國代表柳雨生君見面爲憾云云。</p>
<p>柳雨生談</p>
<p>旋由柳雨生君談稱：此次得與上野山田兩先生見面，極爲愉快，大東亞出版公司及文化出版研究所雖成立未久，但進行極爲順利，相信對中日文化關係上當有重大貢獻，此首先應向二位感謝者，關於上海雜誌界之一般情形想兩氏在未與我人會見前亦知巳甚詳，現上海出版之雜誌達數十餘種，其中除一二雜誌有悠久之歷史外，大都係在中日事變後創刋，元共在大東亞戰爭後，國府參戰後出版更多，故不論專門的，一般的，其本身直接間接均適合戰時體制，發揮其功用及力量，因此我人認爲所有文化雜誌，除在實際上表現外，在思想上亦必需更深刻一些，以獲得普遍的了解與同情，這是積極希望要做到的，我們從表面上看來，在政治上中日合作是一件事，而中日文化界的携手是另一件事，但事實上是同樣重要的，故希望雜誌界多加努力，我們同溯自民國二十年九月以後，中國文化界對中日關係的言論、便失去了瞭　。僅有以往徐遵隣氏的「敵乎友乎」與最近陳彬蘇先生的「論蔣介石」、最能瞭解中日關係，找希　文化界同人對中日關係再作深刻的硏究、而走向此一路綫。</p>
<p>葉德銘談</p>
<p>繼由葉德　氏發表意見，略稱東亞聯盟中四大綱領之一、即係文化溝通，而一般日本人的習慣以爲文化思想與政治不能聯繫一起，而中國人士則以爲文化思想不能脫離政治因自民國成立以來思想運動從未離開政治，如一日離開　洽，則必脫雊現實、結果趨於失敗，例如大東亞出版公司及出版文化研究所在中國人看來，必與政治聯繫一起，將來兩位在南京北京視察後、定能發現此種現象　。其次東亞聯盟運動在中國尙屬發動時期，從它的歷史與發展過程上看來是取消了黨派的分別國府汪主席曾宣佈此項運動爲中國之國策，且爲三民主義的具體的發展、但日本文化界出版界對此種運動的文章，不論贊成與吾，頗少提及，希望以後能根據文化溝通這一點，相互了解共同努力，最後並盼日本文化界對中國文化之介紹能在幾千年前的舊文化外，介紹現實的新文化云。</p>
<p>楊光政談</p>
<p>繼由楊光政對文化思想問題，發表意見稱，中日關係無論在地理上，文化上，血統上，均具有應該合作的條件，但對思想之轉移一事更屬重要，故如中日關係之思想轉移後，當然可作深切的合作、　互提携，但此　思想之實　，必須互相諒解，互相平等，當可有偉大之　就，有許多人以爲中日文化溝通，必先由　語着手，但我人不難囘憶留日之中國著名作家郭沫若郁達夫田漢等，對於日語均極流利，怛因思想問題，朱能參加我人之陣營，故單以言　溝通尙有不夠最要者莫　思想及精神之溝通。總之，中日關係不能在表面上一味表示親養友好，當由人民之　神上，內心上，加以觀察，大家推誠相見，坦白指出缺點，有切實的諒解，進而在文化思想精神上　底的溝通，而使兩國人民接受大東亞非榮的最高現　。</p>
<p>周瘦鵑談</p>
<p>最後由中國雜誌界前　，周瘦鵑氏發表其抱負稱，本人除愛好文藝外，復愛好　藝，更對日本之盆裁及花道表示欽佩、過去曾創辦「盆裁雜誌」，介糾中日之盆裁、至今尙留有此種照片甚多彌足珍貴囘憶二十年　前，日本在滬出版之某雜誌，曾譯載　人之著　「祖國之微」、爲一愛國小說，譯者爲桃川氏，此乃本人所引以爲榮者，希望今後我人能在文化上澈底合作云。最後並談及日本出版界情形及文化人生活，據談，日本報紙每令僅售五六元日金與中國洛陽紙貴之情形相去不啻千里、故出版物甚多，印刷所有應接不暇之勢、且均預約，文化人之收入則較中國文人爲高，每頁四百字左有平均　日金十元左右，米糧價極低每斗（合中國二斗）僅售日金五元，使人民生活安定，文化事業極爲發浮云，暢談　七時始散云。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>今日的上海市塲</h3>
<p>不多幾日以前、我們曾經說過，近來上海的物價狂漲潮，其街動的原力，已經是超出經濟問題以外，而成爲具有政治意味的，因爲「投機囤積份子，對於最近政治　勢、有意散佈有計劃之謠言」、於是重要商品之暗盤行市，在當局不准發表的幕後，愈演愈烈，以至於猖獗不可收拾，而民衆生活。遂乃　趨於水深火熱之中。結果，物價的沸騰，釀成民怨的沸騰。而幕後散布謠言的份子，恰正如願以償！</p>
<p>鼓動物價全面漲風，自以散布謠言爲其無形的工具，其意義則爲貶輕國家通貨的價値，加重人民生活的威脅；至於有形的工具，其中最主要的一個，即爲利用人民公衆所抱貨幣不能脫離黃金的愚笨思想，以及上海各種市塲仍惟金市馬首是瞻的惡劣現象，以暗抬烚赤售價，使其再接再厲、漫無止境的在漲，使其在整個的上海市塲中，掀起一番激烈奔騰的狂潮，使其同胞民衆在日常生活上，人人有朝不保夕之歎，使其自身坐收漁人之利，他人徒受流言之害。此情此景即爲今日的上　市塲！此情此景，即爲收同租界聲中所繼續存在的現象！</p>
<p>今日的上海市塲，猶如火焚欲免燎原，速須撲滅，否則，上海經濟前途是不堪設想的。</p>
<h3>錢兌業陷於停滯　紛紛改組行荘烟號</h3>
<p>上海市錢兌業同業公會各會員錢莊業務，近仍陷於停頓之呆滯狀態，其改組爲銀行及滙劃錢莊或烟仃者甚衆，該業合組之錢聯銀行股東，大半爲錢兌同業，往來亦以錢兌同業爲多、營業情形、尙稱良好，茲誌詳情如次：</p>
<p>營業不振</p>
<p>事變前原有少數中外貨幣買賣業務平庸，迄至戰後二年，因各業市塲未　常態，公債股票黃金紗布外弊交易轉盛　該業遂人多數獲得　利，於是新組開業幾如雨後春筍，由百餘家同業，旋即增至二百餘家之多，此爲錢兌業之全盛時期，迨至當局取締投機禁營暗市交易及大東亞戰爭發生，英美貨幣相繼停止流通買賣後，該同業乃一蹶不振，各荘業務幾全停頓，截至目前，停止經營，改組銀行及匯　錢莊　烟紙商號者已有六七十家現碩果僅存者亦祗一百五十餘家而已。</p>
<p>改組銀行</p>
<p>錢兌業自退出錢業市塲自組公會後，一切建　幾與銀錢兩業之機構相同除辦理學校圖書館理髪室以外、並先組織錢兌業交換所，　組錢兌業聯合準備庫，統理同業票提交換收　轉賬等事宜，不久交換所停辦，僅有準備庫存在，至本年春間該同業協議、遂改組準備庫爲錢聯銀行，該銀行資本計二百萬元，係該同業共同所投資集成，　財政部當局令限銀錢兩業增加資本總額，該業爲謀同業往來便利起見，已由該黃事會決定增加資本之議，並定於本月二十四日召集臨時股東會討論增加數額，擬俟決定後，即依照手續，呈請財政部核準云。</p>
<h3>紗布限價　決嚴格執行</h3>
<p>昨據上海社記者向棉布業方面探悉，關於本市棉紗布存底迄今猶相當充買，足　華中各地數載需要。現該業公會對於同業會員之逾限出售，決予嚴厲制止，凡同業在門市售貸。必須標明限價，如有越軌情事，各界均可檢舉告密，以憑究辦，同時運往外埠者，應照定章先向公會請發證明單，此項單上須　明（一）商號名稱（二）地址（三）經理入姓名（四）運往地點（五）承受商號名稱（六）棉紗布種類（七）總共數額（八）出品廠家（九）商標名稱（十）起迄地點等，由公會蓋章後，始可向商業統制總會物資許可事務所具領搬運許可證。　非公會會員，曁此項棉紗布未經向關係方面登記者，則拒絕發給許可證。據悉目前棉布之搬運出境者以冬令用者爲多，同時其運往地點的有下列各地，南京無錫蘇州杭州嘉興鎭江娃埠松江等。昨又據熟諳布業狀况者告稱，最近二三月來，小型棉布號之設立，如同雨後春筍，多以「加三放」爲號召，故其平日營業殊不亞於大型棉布號，而此等商號資本較薄，貨式不夥，順棉業公會前曾通告几同業所用量器，皆以市尺爲標準，藉資劃一，而遵業規</p>
<h3>粉麥商登記　限期展延</h3>
<p>在商統會體系下之粉麥統制，自行政院核定統收小麥方案，而各產區新麥紛紛登塲後，在實務方面頗有優越之進展。蓋華方雜糧業公會會員曁粉麥商人與日方製粉組合各麥商之資格與買賣旣行登記　統制步驟自易進行，但該項登記自開始以來至現在爲止，各粉麥商睿有因可諒之理由，而未及辯理資格登記。茲爲　全各商權益起見、特將登記限期展至本月二十日止。</p>
<h3>收買小麥完成後　粉廠將開工</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會粉麥專業委員會，決定收購小麥方案後、即經與中日銀行界商妥小麥借款十萬萬元，決定主要產區設立分支辦事處，督促進行收買小麥事宜，現悉各辦事處首步辦理各地麥行販賣商委託商及製粉廠商等資格登記手續，已告完竣，各行商均已紛紛向各該地產區，按照旣定價格收買小麥，大致本月底收買工作可告一段落，聞本市阜豐粉廠及內地各中日商製粉廠，已在修理機車中，八月中旬即可分別開工製粉。</p>
<h3>華中苞米紅糧　收買估計</h3>
<p>本年度華中各地區苞米高粱產量，茲據油糧委員會估計收買可能額；苞米計崇明區五萬担至一萬担，靑浦區十五萬担，南　鎭江區一萬担，蕪湖區十五萬担、安慶區十萬担　通海區三萬担。高粱計皖北區五萬担揚州泰東區五萬担，共計苞米四十九萬担至四十五萬担，高　十萬担。</p>
<h3>中國經濟研究會　工作概況</h3>
<p>中國經濟研究會爲水市　濟界人士周作民吳震　唐壽民李升伯等發起組織之經濟硏究機關，　於成都路　安寺路中國銀行內。成立以來雖僅數月、而工作進行頗爲積極。查該會設有調查研究部，　司實際　料之蒐集，調查統計，編輯等工作。此外並　置金融·工業·貿易三專門委員會，網維木市各　專家共同負責　行　該會出版之「中國經濟兩月刊」創刊號，茲已出版，重要論文有一兩重人格之上　金融市塲」，「華北華中之貿易　匯兌」，「統制經濟下之匯兌　」、「淸代經濟史」等篇，內容皆甚新頴充實云。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股狂漲後突見銳落，堅心驟轉虛軟，蓋金價空　狂跌，且股價太高，買戶納量本巳轉弱，自動貶價　戶湧集，於正午左右更呈有供少求狀囘跌疲風巳起，比前日雖仍軋升，前途實未予樂觀，市勢仍在混亂中。百貨業之永安·新新。國貨三公司及　衣均一見新高價後即囘下偽景綸景福兩衫襪亦在盤升中，永安紡織起伏日狹，榮豐紡微挺秀，小票面大中華織造抬至關口，國信·國光·新豐印染等盤升不巳，南洋烟公司堅站關外，大巾華火柴突挺，閘北水電與華商電氣盤升，新藥業之中法藥房再見軋漲，新亞藥廠一度曾出一重關，信誼，五洲，巾四明星香水、均有成交，價跳升亦勁，文化業商務，中華，世界三書局進出價相距甚遠一，其他小票面之各雜股，忽爲投資者垂靑，如久安實業，大中華實業，新益地產，通易信託，中興木業，中國鐘廠，德豐針織，新亞建業，保安玻璃均曾挺升、中國磚瓦，康元製罐軋升亦勁。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>金銀　銀樓　金門市售價及手續費仍舊，但無貨兌出，業外喊價混亂，一度哄過大關，最後囘挂，囘入關內，銀價上升甚多，將叩大關。</p>
<p>日用品　火柴漲勢達於沸點，致價迭創新高峯。肥皂洋燭在高峯中掙扎，結果亦軋升。捲烟因市存枯燥，價亦步向上游，大英漲勢獨占鰲頭，其他各牌上升亦厲。</p>
<h3>簡訊</h3>
<p>本市漆業公會於前日下午二時假寗波旅滬同鄉會舉行成立大會，到經濟局市商會代表及會員代表百餘人，通過會章，投票選舉，結果葉日暄等九人當選爲理事，章南園等五人當選爲監事，均於即日宣誓就職。</p>

<h3>「識時務」者</h3>
<p>— 志武</p>
<p>頑固守舊的人，故步自封，不明事理，剛愎自用，不但是犯上時代的錯誤，而且終必會被時代洪流所擴棄的。</p>
<p>易曰：「知機其神乎！』大好機會，是千載一時，瞬即消逝，難得而易失的。因此，「識時務者爲俊傑』，立身處世，能夠認淸時代，把握時代，便是偉大事業成功的秘訣。</p>
<p>所以，從來有志之士，都是見機而作，待時而動，決不輕舉妄爲。孔老夫子是聖之時者也，可以行則行，可以止則止。邦有道則現，邦無道則隱。但知明哲保身，決不同流合活，聰明如子房，他便是個「識時務』者的實例。他深知劉邦的爲人，可以共患難，不可以共安樂，所以當他竭盡忠誠，附助劉邦興漢後，爲後患計，於是功成身退。執迷不悟如范增，不於項羽殺卿子冠軍之時去楚，想依附項羽去求功名利祿，到後來然後離去，已經時已晚矣，這便是他的「不識時務」的結果。</p>
<p>時乎時乎不再來！因此，「識時務」者立身行道，一定會看風駛舵，當機立斷，乘勢進取，決不與時代潮流逆進的。</p>
<h3>從日本歸來（二）</h3>
<p>— 盛毓度</p>
<p>男女各盡天職</p>
<p>彼國政府與人民確在戰爭狀况中，而感余最深者，實爲人民之服從，與協助之精神。彼邦人民，絕對服從政府之命令無規避法令以圖取巧情事。人人刻苦自勵犧牲享受，男子固然，即女子亦同具此種精神爲社會服務者則工作於外爲家庭治事者、則操勞於內，決非專事，塗脂抹粉，只有消費，而無生產者可比，總之彼邦於戰時狀况之下，政府統制之澈底節的物資之切實與夫國民之各盡天職愛國忠君，及協助政府之精神實足爲我國人士之棒喝。上海經幾番變化，危險叢生，直至今日安然度過，實屬萬分僥倖，而來日方長此種僥倖，殊不足持，可一而不可再可暫而不可久，似此各存僥倖之心羣趨投機之塲其幸而一中者則悖入悖出揮霍無度不幸而不中者，始則鋌而走險以圖孤注之一擲，終則傾家喪生，至於不可收拾，其影響國家前途、爲害社會安靑，何堪設想。</p>
<p>國人亟宜猛省</p>
<p>余以爲國家爲生存而奮鬥，爲自由而掙扎，絕非爲政者之單獨力量所可爲功，重要關鍵，仍在國民各個人之邁進，集各單位之力量以爲政府之力量維持各個人之秩序，以爲社會之秩序吾願上海市民及早覺悟拋棄僥倖，及苟安觀念、爲國家着想爲社會着想，僥倖之允者莫如今日之投機事業，囤集居奇，不僅爲害於國家社會即於本身亦互有循環之害，蓋以少數之人之財力，所囤積之種類必屬極少數，萬不能集人生必需之物品，一舉而囤積之。</p>
<p>故吾曰消滅僥倖，排除苟安，各個人自本位做起，自小處做起，以正當途徑，建設營運，多一分生產，即爲國家培一分元氣：省一分物力，即爲國家儲一分力量，今日之犧牲即明日之享受，今日之苦痛即明日之安樂。反言之。今日之苟安即明日之痛苦目前之享受即未來之犧牲，余此行雖不久，而百感交集，用述梗槪，　盼人之長補己之短，人必自助而後人助之，而後天助之，願與上海市民共勉之！（完）</p>
<h3>鷄</h3>
<p>— 沈沈</p>
<p>也起身了，一邊穿衣，一邊往屋外跑，瞥見爸爸坐在凳上呆想，她砟晚在酣睡後所見混亂的一幕，已記不大清楚了。</p>
<p>「爸！你這麼早就起來了！我還有三隻鷄蛋，爸可以拿到鎭上換點　油囘來。」秀寳說着，嘴裏又喙…喙…喙的準備拉開鷄棚，放出鷄來，一　母鷄，急忙地奔出，展翅的展翅，伸脚的伸脚，拉屎的拉屎，各自做其晨起的工作。秀　握了一撮麥子，撒在地上，母鷄們爭先恐後的圍着搶吃。阿坤却默默地看着這幾隻鷄，更出神地囘想着昨晚的一幕，使心靈上的創痕，更加深刻。</p>
<p>「啊呀！爸！不好了！昨天來過的這個穿灰布衣的又來了！你看！」秀　忽然驚呼起來，手指着南面向着自已家裏走來的兩個穿灰布衣的人。前面的看出是昨天來過要鷄的一個小傢伙，後面跟着的是一個高個子、阿坤抬着頭，正在辨認，一忽兒已經走到塲上了，阿坤心裏一陣別別的跳。料想惡運又要臨頭了！雖然，懷着憎恨的心情，可是沒有發洩的勇氣啊！</p>
<p>幾隻母鷄還在爭食着星散的麥子，咯，咯，咯地叫着牠更不知道惡運將快在一霎那以後降臨。穿灰布衣的那個小傢伙，已經瞥見昨天看見過的肥大的母鷄，就囘頭向着另外一個長大個子擊着嘴，並不作聲。</p>
<p>「好！好肥大的稿子，抓囘去可以大嚼一頓了！」高個子喊着，就動手去抓。小保伙也就幫着攔阻，一陣緊急的脚步，咯，咯，咯的母鷄的亂　聲，終於被他們抓住了兩只。可憐的母鷄，還在他們手裏拚命地掙扎着亂叫着，可是這一囘再沒有辦法挽囘了。</p>
<p>「不！不！不肯的！我前鷄正在生蛋呀！我們要靠它　取油鹽的，不！不肯的！」秀寳依然哭嚷着。走上前去攘　，高個子把右手裏的一隻鷄交給小傢伙，撩起一記耳光，把秀寳打得一臉紅印。秀寳就仰在地上　滾亂　得發狂！</p>
<p>「他媽的！老子要吃鷄，那管你肯不肯！要是你大了幾歲，述你人都要帶去，哈！哈！哈！走吧！」高個子一壁哼着，一壁露出得意揚揚的笑臉，挾着母鷄向原路走去。秀寳却依然仰在地上大哭大喊。</p>
<p>阿坤坐在旁邊的凳子上，一陣火，一陣酸，已經激得心靈麻木了。昨晚的故事，很淸楚地在腦中，那裏還敢說話呢？眼巴巴的望着他們揚長而去，望着秀寳哀哀地哭嚷着，東想着母鷄！……鷄蛋！……銀索子！……田軍！……通匪！……藏槍械！……果得比木鷄還蠢！（完）</p>

        <h1>1943.07.17</h1>
<h3>The Practice of Decisive Battle Living</h3>
<p>A few days ago, Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech at the Central Cooperation Decisive Battle Council in Japan, calling on the one hundred million Japanese people to practice decisive battle living, thereby uniting the ten hundred million people of East Asia and earnestly cooperating to strive for the final victory of the war. Reading this speech has triggered endless reflections in us.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, since the war, the Japanese people have already entered the right track of wartime living under the leadership of the government. The government has various regulations and leading organizations to encourage wartime living, advancing strict restrictions and political guidance simultaneously. Moreover, there are various folk organizations that conduct self-policing and self-discipline, so that the national living can fully comply with the government's intentions and requirements for combat. Whether in spirit or in material, they do not want to live outside the law, seek freedom, or avoid restraint. This spirit of sacrifice of one hundred million people with one heart is entirely to be loyal to the government and the state, and it fully expresses the people's confidence in the nation and the war. However, they are not satisfied with this. Today, as this world war is approaching the decisive battle stage, they are redoubling their efforts to suppress the daily living of the people under the central goal of "practicing decisive battle living", and advancing toward the path of "purity, freshness, simplicity, and frugality." Whether in food, clothing, housing, transportation, or spiritual life, they further demand that everyone exercise self-restraint and endure suffering in order to concentrate the heart, strength, ability, and material resources of one hundred million people, accumulate combat power, and lay a solid foundation for victory in the future decisive battle. In order to defend East Asia and ensure the liberation and freedom of the ten hundred million people of East Asia, the Japanese people are enduring all kinds of suffering and shouldering the most arduous responsibilities. Every Chinese person will inevitably feel ashamed because of this!</p>
<p>In the stage of the great decisive battle, the importance of China's position is beyond doubt. Whether the Chinese people can shoulder their due responsibilities without disappointing the Allied countries and other East Asian nations depends on how we live our daily lives. In reality, apart from the majority of our people who have been passively plunged into extremely difficult circumstances due to the impact of the war in recent years, it can be said that there are not many who have actively and autonomously rectified their lives in view of their own responsibilities. Generally speaking, whether rich, poor, or middle class, we have rarely seen anyone who can automatically change their state of living in view of the difficulties of the times and the honor and disgrace of the nation, and dedicate all their heart, strength, and material resources to the country. We have repeatedly advocated the implementation of wartime living, but so far only a few social leaders and some well-known figures in the business community have begun to practice it. The extravagance and waste in Shanghai remains the same. Looking at the "purity, freshness, simplicity, and frugality" of the lives of people in other countries, and then looking at our current situation, how can we not feel ashamed?</p>
<p>We believe that the movement to practice decisive battle living must be promoted quickly and effectively in China, especially in Shanghai. First of all, the operation of improper entertainment venues, as well as tea houses and restaurants, should be restricted, and the supply of water and electricity and their business hours should be limited. At the same time, in addition to restaurants that are necessary for the people and legitimate entertainment venues that meet the needs of wartime, heavy taxes must be levied. However, this income must be used to relieve refugees who have no clothing or food, and to run public welfare and social education undertakings.</p>
<p>In terms of clothing and food, on the one hand, the guidance of the authorities is certainly needed to clearly define wartime living standards, but on the other hand, the enlightenment of the general public is especially important. Based on historically passed-down habits, people have various misconceptions and prejudices. For example, when it comes to food, they all believe in rice and do not believe in the nutritional value of miscellaneous grains. We hope that scientists and experts will work hard to study and publicize the nutritional value of various foods, and promote the consumption of miscellaneous grains and potatoes, etc., in order to reduce the shortage of rice. For example, the general public in Shanghai has always loved pork as the best dish. Middle-class families consider it a loss of face not to eat pork. In fact, the nutritional value of pork is not very high, and the general public can do without it. On the contrary, pork can also transmit diseases. From an economic point of view, countless poor people's food is taken away to feed pigs, and raising pigs should also be restricted for the sake of material conservation.</p>
<p>As for clothing, due to habit, everyone knows that "one would rather suffer hardship than lose face," and has no choice but to wear high-quality Chinese and Western suits and high-end shoes and hats, etc. Whether in terms of personal economy, health, convenience of work, or social material resources, this is an extremely unreasonable phenomenon. We hope that leading figures in various industries and sectors will take the lead in advocating that Western suits should not be worn with jackets or ties in summer, and that "Hong Kong shirts," etc., should be regarded as ideal and appropriate summer clothing. For Chinese clothing, we should promote cloth short jackets. As long as patched clothing and shoes are neat and clean, it is not a loss of face, and should be respected. Women's fancy clothing, especially luxurious accessories, should be regarded as a special mark of women in improper occupations. By promoting simple and plain clothing, the social atmosphere can be improved, the national economy can be improved, and the country can benefit from the conservation of materials.</p>
<p>What we must specifically point out here is that, on the one hand, we must immediately promote the movement to practice decisive battle national living, and on the other hand, the authorities must strive to ensure the minimum living standards of the people, such as the low-priced rationing system for food and daily necessities, which must be implemented thoroughly. Then, the success of the decisive battle living movement can be guaranteed, and the social contradictions and crises of extreme wealth and extreme poverty can be eliminated, which will have great benefits for future revival and construction.</p>

<h3>Japan Central Cooperation Council Concludes Successfully Yesterday Evening, Unanimously Passes "Oath of Certain Victory"</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - The 16th was the last day of the Japanese Central Cooperation Council. The plenary session was reconvened at 8:00 a.m. First, Major General Tanihagi, Chief of the Army Press Section of the General Headquarters, and Lieutenant Commander Tashiro, member of the Navy Press Section, explained in detail the most recent military situation. Then, Chairman Kobayashi explained that all councilors proposed to draft an "Oath of Certain Victory" to strive for the final victory of the Great East Asia War in order to express their determination. After drafting committee was immediately elected to draft the text, it was unanimously passed. Subsequently, the chairman of the committee reported that the government and the Support Association were requested to earnestly implement the resolutions passed today. Then, Director General Ikawa of the Technology Agency, Commerce and Industry Minister Kishi, Communications Minister Terashima, and others made speeches on the issues under their jurisdiction, explaining the government's attitude and feelings. Subsequently, Maruyama, Secretary-General of the Support Association Headquarters, Ozaki, Director-General of General Affairs, and Ishiguro, Director of Training, stood up to express their views with reference to the government's intentions, and strongly stated that important proposals should be implemented as soon as possible, and explained the future movement policy of the Support Association. Finally, Chairman Kobayashi made a ruling and a speech, and the discussion was completed here. The closing ceremony was then held, and Director General Tojo delivered a speech. Thus, the Sino-British Cooperation Council, which had profound significance under the decisive battle, successfully concluded on the evening of the 16th.</p>
<h3>Director Tanihagi Detailed War Situation in Various Aspects, Raising the Determination of 100 Million Japanese People</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Major General Tanihagi, Chief of the Army Press Section of the Japanese General Headquarters, explained in detail the U.S. counter-offensive intentions and the war situation in various parts of the South Pacific at the plenary session of the Central Cooperation Council on the 16th, and raised the determination of the 100 million Japanese people. The original text is as follows: The United States regards "material," "production," and "time" as the three elements of war victory. However, the necessary types and quantities of material are not satisfactory. Due to various factors, production will reach its saturation point this autumn, and it will be difficult to rapidly increase production thereafter. However, if Japan is given a considerable amount of time, it will inevitably strengthen its political and strategic posture. Therefore, it is only natural that the United States intends to give Japan a major blow during its most advantageous period of this year and next year. Roosevelt also said in his message to Congress that 1943 was the year of the decisive battle. However, it would take considerable time and enormous sacrifices to carry out a counter-offensive against Japan on some Pacific islands. This would be a poor strategy. If Midway Island and the Aleutian Islands were used as bases to launch air raids on the Japanese mainland, the range of the aircraft would be insufficient, which would be useless. If aircraft carriers were used to attack the Japanese mainland, it would be extremely dangerous. As a result, the United States sought a base on the continent close to Japan to launch an aerial decisive battle against Japan. Therefore, it must first strengthen the Air Force stationed in Chongqing, but the supply of these can only rely on the air transport route from India. It is estimated that its monthly transport volume is only about a thousand tons, which is not sufficient. Therefore, the enemy has no choice but to attempt to seize Burma. This operation to seize Burma is not only to increase the assistance to Chongqing in the war of resistance against Japan and strengthen the strength of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, but also to defend the security of India. At a time when the independence movement in India is in full swing, this is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>The United States Encounters its Greatest Crisis</p>
<p>The British and Indian troops began the operation to seize Burma at the end of last year, but after repeated failures, their attempts have completely failed. In this view, it is becoming increasingly difficult to approach the Japanese mainland. However, the enemy will never stop at this difficulty, and will try to increase its combat power to the maximum extent within the next two years, making a desperate struggle. However, if there are no great victories in the meantime, it will inevitably arouse questions from the general public. For example, Croc, the Washington bureau chief of the New York Times, once said that the U.S. domestic war line has encountered its greatest crisis since the start of the war. This is also the case. In addition, the failure of anti-inflation measures, the high cost of living, frequent labor disputes, difficulties in food supply, the struggle between bureaucrats for power, and the political struggle before the election of the president, the domestic situation is extremely uneasy. Moreover, the flaws in the anti-Axis camp have not yet been repaired. Therefore, it can only seek the support of public opinion with the results of the war and maintain its credibility with the anti-Axis countries. In November of last year, the British and American troops landed in North Africa, and their war was fortunately successful, and they won great praise for a time. After that, the leaders of the two countries further discussed the war policy in Washington. As a result, the principle of Europe first was generally adopted. At the same time, they tried to take the opportunity to launch an active offensive against Japan in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Surface Aid to the Soviet Union is Actually Self-Serving</p>
<p>The United States never had the true intention of actively rescuing the Soviet Union, but only to make Germany and the Soviet Union both lose, so as to benefit itself. It did not achieve ideal results in North Africa or Western Europe, and even the sacrifices in the future may not be rewarded. Therefore, it believes that the move to attack Europe is not appropriate. Looking back at East Asia, Chongqing is becoming increasingly declining. If it is not actively assisted, the result may be that it will break away from Britain and the United States. At the same time, Australia is also afraid of the Japanese army's attack and hopes to increase its assistance. Therefore, the United States can take the opportunity to intervene in Australia and India to fulfill its long-standing wish to defeat Japan. Therefore, the United States advocates the Pacific First Doctrine. Therefore, even if it accepts Britain's Europe First Doctrine, the momentum of its implementation will inevitably be unusually cold. Based on this, the United States launched a counter-offensive operation in the South Pacific. It can be seen that the U.S. counter-offensive in the South Pacific this time is not temporary or local in nature. It can be regarded as a large-scale counter-offensive operation with a concrete plan. The U.S. military is still greedy for endlessness, vainly believes in material victory, and still underestimates the Japanese air force's combat power and its productivity. The U.S. military on the battlefield initially had a considerable strong fighting spirit due to its adventurous spirit, curiosity, heroism, and banditry spirit. However, this is ultimately a kind of childishness, and was completely defeated at the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>The U.S. Propaganda Conceals Traces of Defeat</p>
<p>The U.S. counter-offensive this time is a great opportunity for us to annihilate the enemy, destroy its human and material resources, and destroy its tactics of relying on mechanical power and material power. Therefore, this counter-offensive operation of the anti-Axis forces is generally said by insightful people to be not a "gamble for victory" but a "crazy adventure." The general situation of the U.S. counter-offensive this time is briefly described as follows: Since June 30, the U.S. powerful army and navy have landed on Rendova Island and New Georgia Island in the Solomon Islands, aiming at Munda and continuing to advance forward. The Japanese army and navy stationed there are fighting bravely. In New Guinea Island, a part of the U.S. army landed in Nassau Bay on June 30, and another part went north from SARS and invaded. In addition, a part of the Australian army echoed this and attacked near Salamaua. Our army also intercepted it near Salamaua, and on the 5th of this month, it unexpectedly attacked the enemy's rear in the Papabun region, and all of them fled in panic. In addition, the two islands of Moa and Creina in eastern New Guinea Island, which have not been occupied by our army, seem to have been occupied by a part of the U.S. army around the 1st of this month. Initially, the United States publicized that this operation would first occupy Rabaul, take this as a base, and then advance to cut off the connection between the Japanese army and Mango Island, or use it as a smokescreen for new operations in other areas. However, the progress of its operations was not only not as it intended, but also suffered great losses. Therefore, it falsely claimed that this was to defend Australia, or to capture Rabaul, only to occupy the bases near the area. It further stated to its people that this great sacrifice was expected in order to cover up the traces of defeat.</p>
<h3>Mussolini Praises Great East Asia Policy, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Replies with a Thank You Message</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo previously issued the Great East Asia Declaration at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet. This has aroused great goodwill internationally, especially in the Axis countries, which have unanimously expressed their welcome. Now, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, on the 8th, entrusted the Italian Ambassador to Japan with a statement to be handed over to Prime Minister Tojo. The content of the statement was roughly as follows: I am one of the people who praised General Tojo's policy. I believe that this kind of policy is the most appropriate way to solve various problems in East Asia. I will convey this meaning to General Tojo. Also, Interlabos is an old friend of mine. I firmly believe that the cause he is undertaking will be completed. Therefore, it is urgent to assist Bose, and please also convey this to Your Excellency. After receiving the letter, Prime Minister Tojo immediately instructed Japanese Ambassador to Italy Hidaka to reply to Prime Minister Mussolini on the 16th, saying in the main: Your Excellency's praise for the policy adopted by our country to solve various problems in East Asia, wrongly, has increased our belief that the Axis will win (omitted in the middle), and I express my deep gratitude to the Italian Prime Minister.</p>
<p>War Situation Outside the South Pacific</p>
<p>Major General Tanihagi briefly described the war situation in various aspects other than the South Pacific as follows: In Burma, although it is now the rainy season, the British and Indian troops on the border still attack from time to time with small-scale troops, or use aircraft to disturb the rear, trying to recapture the area. However, they were repelled by our army at any time and place, so they have not succeeded at all. Britain appointed Wavell as the Governor-General of India, and established a new East Asia Operations Command in an attempt to exaggerate the situation. It also said that after the capture of Tunisia, it would transfer the ships in the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, preparing to carry out new operations after the rainy season. This is also what we are looking forward to, so that it can repeat the ugly drama on the Mayu Riverbank of the Arakan Mountains this spring. In addition, the aid of aircraft from India to Chongqing has continued unabated. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing began to move again after the weather turned better in early May. Recently, it has been constantly blindly bombing Hankou, Guangzhou, Vietnam, Haiphong, and other places. The enemy forces in the Aleutians seem to be deeply shaken by the spirit of Japanese soldiers after the Battle of Attu Island, but their ambition to seize Kiska Island has not diminished. They carry out air raids or bombard from the coast from time to time, but our garrison ensures the island and destroys the enemy's morale, which is extremely strong.</p>
<h3>The Situation of Fierce Battles in New Georgia and Other Places, Concrete Explanation by Lieutenant Commander Tashiro</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant Commander Tashiro of the Press Section of the Japanese General Headquarters gave a concrete explanation of the battle situation on New Georgia Island and Rendova Island at the plenary session of the Japanese Central Cooperation Council today, citing facts in order to promote the greatest determination of the Japanese people. He said: When the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet was convened in mid-June, the Minister of the Navy had already made a statement on the naval war situation. Therefore, what I am talking about today is the battle situation centered on New Georgia Island. The Japanese bases in that area are Rabaul Island and Buka Island between Rabaul and Guadalcanal Island. Guadalcanal and Rabaul are 600 kilometers apart, Rabaul and Buka are 300 kilometers apart, and New Georgia Island is in the center between Buka and Guadalcanal Islands. The island is 120 kilometers away from Guadalcanal, and its shape is like a cucumber. In the northwest is Kolombangara Island, which is shaped like a lotus leaf. The distance between the two islands is 15 kilometers at its widest point and 7 kilometers at its narrowest point. On the southern coast of the island of New Georgia is Munda Port. Five kilometers south of Munda Port is Rendova Island, which is shaped like a pipe. The area of fierce fighting now is centered on New Georgia, Kolombangara, and Rendova. Now I will briefly explain the situation before the enemy troops landed on Rendova Island on June 30. Therefore, since the beginning of the month, it has gradually increased its air force strength. At the same time, the strength of the Japanese air force has also gradually increased. The two sides are confronting each other, or bombing each other's air bases, or destroying each other's reinforcement routes, or engaging in aerial combat, almost every day. As the air force strength of both sides increased, the fighting became more and more intense. After entering June, the Japanese air force repeatedly bombed the enemy bases on Guadalcanal and the enemy air bases on the remote New Hebrides and Little Islands. In addition, it has repeatedly attacked the enemy's large transport convoys on Pinesel Island and Longa Bay, and has also engaged in fierce air battles with the enemy in the skies over St. Trand. On the other hand, the enemy has also repeatedly launched attacks on our positions, air bases, and ground troops. The days with the most enemy planes coming to attack after June reached 70 or more than 100. The Japanese army and naval ground troops on New Georgia Island and Kolombangara Island in that area used machine guns to shoot down the enemy planes that came to attack under the enemy's attack. This is what I personally witnessed and heard in that area. This is no different from crashing enemy aircraft carriers with planes. On the morning of June 30, enemy cruisers, destroyers, transport convoys, etc. appeared west of Rendova Island. Since the First Battle of the Solomon Sea, every time the enemy carried out a large-scale landing operation, it was followed by a large fleet, and at the same time, a large-scale naval battle was often launched. However, this time it was different. Landing craft and dozens of naval vessels, a total of 200, were full of troops, weapons, ammunition, and headed towards Rendova. At the same time, destroyers and cruisers were used as the main body for protection. After our army discovered the enemy ships, it immediately engaged in battle. The damage inflicted on the enemy has been announced by the General Headquarters. I will not repeat the numbers here. However, if we consider that 31 of our planes have not returned, we can know how fierce this battle was and how loyal and brave our army was. The failure of these 31 planes to return is actually only determined by the great sacrifice of 40 planes not returning in the South Pacific naval battle last year. After the enemy troops landed on Rendova Island, they advanced from the north of Rendova Island to a small island between Munda and Rendova to the south of New Georgia the next day. This is Rubiana Island. Enemy traces have also been found in that area on July 1. On July 2 and 3, the enemy used part of its forces to land in the southern area of Munda. On the other hand, enemy troops also landed on the mid-southern coast of New Georgia. The fierce battle between the two armies with Rendova and Rubiana Island as the center, its color is the one announced by the General Headquarters. The air force of our army on the front line is now in close contact with naval vessels or ground troops, and is fighting the enemy with a spirit of brave attack, and is fiercely counterattacking the enemy advancing from the south of Rendova Island. In addition, the enemy also attempted to launch an attack in the northwest of New Georgia Island, because from the evening of the 4th to the 5th of this month, it suddenly invaded Kula Bay between New Georgia Island and Kolombangara Island in the northwest, and a part of it attempted to land on the northwest coast of New Georgia Island, Rise, and Bairoko West within it. As a result, the part of it that wanted to land in the Bairoko area has been repelled. That night, due to the cooperation of the artillery of our army and naval ground troops and the water and need teams, three enemy ships were sunk first. A few of our destroyers, which were engaged in combat that evening, encountered a powerful enemy fleet consisting of more than ten cruisers and destroyers to the north of Kolombangara Island. Our destroyers immediately attacked the enemy cruisers, and sank one of them, and another one was also hit and caught fire. This is just like the battle when our destroyer defeated the enemy cruiser in the Battle of Bali Island in the past. The water mine team was unparalleled in bravery, so the enemy was greatly defeated and retreated in the night battle of Kula Bay. After that, the enemy actively gathered its forces on the northwest coast of Kula Bay, and our army and naval ground troops fiercely attacked them. This has been announced by the General Headquarters on the 12th. At this point, the enemy began to think about shifting the focus of attack to Munda Bay. On the 12th, the enemy troops in the Kula Bay area attempted to land again. That night, an enemy force of more than four cruisers encountered our water mine team on the sea off Kolombangara Island, and a fierce battle broke out again. As a result, several enemy cruisers were sunk or destroyed. After that, the battle in the Munda area was appropriately announced yesterday. The enemy landed from Rubiana Island to the east of Munda, and another part also approached Munda to attack. Our army saw this and attacked them fiercely. The enemy released smoke, but our army and naval ground troops fiercely counterattacked and repelled the enemy. The enemy lost more than 20 boats and fled in a panic. At this time, a part of the enemy troops that had already landed also attacked again. As a result, they were also repelled. What has been described above is the tragic and fierce battle situation centered on New Georgia Island, the enemy and our air battle, sea battle, and ground troop battle.</p>

<h3>Recent Developments in the South Pacific: Japanese Air Force's Successes Over the Past Ten Days – Large Formation of Japanese Planes Again Bombard Torokina Island – Japanese Fishing Boat Downs Enemy Plane Over Koale Bay</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – New army and navy air units in the South Pacific, in cooperation with ground battles in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, have been continuously bombing enemy bases day and night, and actively escorting convoys, inflicting great damage on the enemy. Based on the combined results achieved in early July (1st to 10th): twenty-two enemy aircraft shot down, five 5,000-ton class enemy transport ships sunk, one 5,000-ton class ship destroyed, numerous small boats sunk, and enemy ground facilities and landing points destroyed at more than five locations, all set ablaze. The Japanese side lost ten aircraft.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) – According to a Melbourne broadcast by American wireless, a large formation of Japanese aircraft again attacked Torokina Island in the Solomon Islands today.

<h3>Japanese Expeditionary Force in China Announces Weekly Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced the battle situation for the week on July 16th: Recently, the Japanese Expeditionary Force has repeatedly launched vigorous mopping-up operations. The Chongqing army has completely gone into hiding. No active resistance has been seen on any front, and they seem focused on recuperating and replenishing their strength. The Chongqing side's dream of continuing resistance now only depends on the United Kingdom and the United States. To launch a counter-offensive against Burma after the rainy season, the Chongqing side has sent a considerable number of troops to that area, willingly obeying the commands of the United Kingdom and the United States and sacrificing the happiness of East Asia. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is strengthening its control over the Chongqing Air Force and is expanding its troop presence on the India Road under the pretext of assisting Chongqing, revealing their ambition more and more openly. They are also taking coercive measures against the Chongqing side, planning to place it under their control. It is said that fierce arguments broke out between the Chongqing and American sides during the round table conference held in Chongqing on the 25th and 26th of last month, which proves this point in general. At the same time, the internal conflicts inherent in US-Chongqing cooperation have become apparent. As the world is approaching the decisive battle stage, the exposure of such discords between the US and Chongqing is noteworthy. The Japanese Expeditionary Force is currently continuing to carry out mopping-up operations in various places in order to consolidate the security of the rear.</p>
<h3>No Major Changes in the Sicilian Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) – The German High Command's daily war bulletin stated today: German-Italian Allied forces yesterday repelled countless enemy offensives on the island of Sicily. These offensives were launched in the areas of Agrigento and Catania. The enemy lost many tanks. At the same time, the German-Italian air force fiercely attacked enemy ships off the coast of the island. Several enemy transport ships were either sunk or severely damaged. From the 10th to the 14th of this month, at least fifty-two transport ships used by the enemy for landing, totaling 300,000 tons, were sunk, and countless others were rendered unusable due to bombing.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) – Reuter's military correspondent, Captain Sertorius, declared: In the twenty-four hours from Wednesday to noon on Thursday, there were no major changes in the situation in Sicily. British and American forces continue to attempt to penetrate the interior, but have been resisted by Axis forces and repeatedly repelled with the help of tanks. The territory partially occupied by British and American forces in certain areas has no major significance from a military point of view. The fighting spirit and morale of the German and Italian defenders of the island are completely unshaken. The Axis command now possesses a large number of fresh troops that have not yet participated in the fighting. On the other hand, the anti-Axis forces have also transferred reinforcements from overseas and have landed and reinforced in the coastal occupied areas. On Wednesday, British and American forces made no further attempts to land at other locations on the coast of Sicily. There is also no sign that other units of the British and American troops that have already landed are joining the fighting. The current battle situation in Sicily can be described as follows: On the right wing of General Montgomery's forces, the pressure on Catania continues, but so far, they have not been able to cross the plain south of the city. On Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, British tanks and British paratroopers who landed in Catania failed to link up. The swift and complete elimination of these paratroopers has greatly affected the British High Command's strategic plans. At the same time, new German reserves south of Catania have launched counter-offensives in several locations and pushed the British forces back several kilometers. The central forces of the British Eighth Army are still suffering heavy losses in the mountains west of Syracuse and Avola, with no progress. On the left wing of General Montgomery's forces, when passing through Modica towards Ragusa, they encountered strong resistance from the Italian army north of that area. In the more western region, American forces are currently engaged in extremely fierce battles. The Canadian troops operating on the left wing of General Patton's American forces are advancing northwest towards Naro. Although the American forces seem to have made some gains, they are of no major significance.</p>

<h3>German Army Repels Soviet Offensive on Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) – The German High Command's daily war bulletin stated today: Although the weather was bad yesterday, the great battle continued in the central sector of the Eastern Front. Our forces advanced further north of Belgorod and encircled a powerful enemy force. The enemy's offensive momentum in this theater has greatly diminished yesterday due to heavy losses in recent days. The enemy launched offensives using infantry and tanks from the Kursk to Sukhinichi line, but were all repelled. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. In one German sector alone, the enemy lost 250 tanks. Despite the treacherous weather, German aircraft worked hard to support the German army and shot down 49 enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Moscow, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Soviet Information Bureau announced last night: "After several counter-attacks, our forces have launched offensives against the German army to the east and north of Orel."</p>
<h3>Wang Kemin Discusses the Recent Situation in North China in Nanjing – Flew from Nanjing to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Council, met with domestic and foreign journalists at the International Club at 11:30 AM on the 16th and gave a speech. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Shao Donghu, a counselor of the North China Political Council, served as the translator. The main points of Mr. Wang's speech are recorded below: There are two most important issues in North China now: (1) food, and (2) security. These two issues are interrelated. North China has never been a rice-producing region. Before the incident, the supply of food relied on imports from other ports. After the incident, food became even scarcer. Therefore, recently, those in North China with some assets mostly eat wheat flour, while the lower classes eat miscellaneous grains. Therefore, I pay close attention to issues such as food regulation and increased production. This matter is being actively worked on by Wang Yintai, the Superintendent of Industry, to formulate reasonable and satisfactory concrete measures to solve the current food panic in North China. As for the security issue, after years of efforts by responsible officials, the security of North China has achieved remarkable results. Recently, the North China Political Affairs Commission established a Communist Suppression Committee, and each province, city, and county has also established separate Communist Prevention Associations to carry out comprehensive Communist prevention work, with the aim of ensuring the security of North China. Later, reporters raised the following questions: (1) What is the relationship between North China affairs and the Central Government? (2) What new plans are there for North China's future administrative measures? (3) What are the plans for improving the exchange of goods between the North and the South? (4) What are your thoughts on the East Asia War and Prime Minister Tojo's new policy towards China? (5) The unification of the Central Government and North China is not without the influence of currency. Does the North China Political Affairs Commission have any concrete measures in this regard? (6) The disaster situation in North China this year is very serious. Are there any concrete relief measures? According to Mr. Wang's reply: North China belongs to the Central Government. The North China Political Affairs Commission is an organization under the control of the National Government. All future administrative measures will be handled in accordance with the intentions of the central government. As for the issue of promoting future administrative affairs, since I have just taken office, I have no concrete plans in this regard. However, Chairman Zhu has already made very good plans, and I will naturally follow the established plans, referring to the actual situation and needs, to gradually promote and improve them. Regarding the issue of the exchange of goods between the North and the South in the future, this point is extremely important. I will instruct the competent authorities to formulate concrete and appropriate measures to ensure the smooth exchange of goods between the North and the South. The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War is a powerful manifestation of our friendly nation Japan's pursuit of the independence and liberation of East Asian nations. The National Government's participation in the war not only expresses the spirit of sharing weal and woe with our friendly nation, but also embodies the solidarity and cooperation of our East Asian nations. I express my deep gratitude and excitement for Prime Minister Tojo's policy speech. Under the leadership of the Central Government, North China will work together with our friendly nation to advance towards the completion of the war. Regarding the currency issue in North China, I am planning to consider it, but there are currently no concrete measures. As for the disaster situation in North China, the harvest in various parts of North China this year is still good, averaging about 50-60%, and there is no actual disaster situation. The main reason is the lack of materials. Therefore, I will advocate for smoother exchange of goods between the North and the South, so that North China will not have a panic due to a lack of materials, and the people's livelihood can be stabilized.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, came to Nanjing this time to report his inauguration to the Chairman and request instructions. He has been busy visiting various related agencies and attending social gatherings in recent days. Mr. Wang's mission to Nanjing has been completed. He took off from Nanjing for Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 16th, accompanied by Counselor Shao Donghu. He plans to handle private matters in Shanghai and will stay for two or three days before returning to Beiping.</p>

<h3>Investigation Begins to Prevent Smuggling and Hoarding of Materials – Material Control Review Organizations Widely Established in Various Locations</h3>
<p>The various trade associations in this city, to prevent the smuggling of materials out of the country and to reduce reserves, have issued separate notices stating: "It has been found that although the city's material reserves are still quite sufficient, it has recently been reported that some colleagues are selling entire batches of materials to small vendors at inflated prices. This behavior not only violates the association's regulations and the authorities' purpose of suppressing prices and cracking down on hoarding, but also has a great impact on the future supply of materials. It should be known that in this extraordinary period, citizens should be frugal and save, in order to prevent future problems. Merchants should abide by regulations to maintain the virtue of merchants. Moreover, the authorities are now making painstaking efforts to stabilize prices in various places, revive local industry and commerce, and vigorously prevent hoarding and strictly control, so that the exchange of goods tends to be smooth. All of my colleagues must abide by the regulations and only sell any kind of goods to legitimate users, and there should be appropriate restrictions to prevent hoarding. If there is any buying and selling that does not comply with the regulations, the association will not provide protection once it is discovered by the authorities."</p>
<p>Strict Investigation</p>
<p>Recently, police detectives belonging to various authorities have been particularly strict in their investigation work. According to reporter inquiries yesterday, there are a large number of police detectives near the various land and water terminals and traffic arteries. If anyone is carrying a larger package or seems suspicious, they will be ordered to stop and be strictly searched. If a large number of materials are found that are attempting to be smuggled out of the country, they will be detained and sent to the bureau for verification. It has been found that recently, due to the chaos of prices in Shanghai and the urgent need for goods in various places, the evil trend of trafficking has become increasingly rampant, which has a considerable impact on the city's commerce.</p>
<p>Material Control</p>
<p>Review Organization. The Material Control Review Committee is the highest national authority for reviewing material control countermeasures. In addition to recommending candidates and preparing to establish the "Wuhan Branch of the Material Control Review Committee," it is also establishing an office in Shanghai. The work of this office will especially focus on the connection with the Business Coordination Committee, so that the review and implementation of material policies can reach a state of integration. At the same time, according to inquiries from the Shanghai News Agency, the Business Coordination Committee, in view of the increasing expansion of its affairs, is preparing to establish the "Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Three-Province Branch" in the Wuhan area and is scheduled to establish an office in Nanjing this month.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Bureau Plans to Levy Foreign Residents' Income Tax and Conduct On-site Inspection of Account Books of Various Industries</h3>
<p>The Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Collection Bureau have been actively promoting various types of taxes. Companies and firms that have complied with regulations to declare their income have been enthusiastic, and tax revenue is thriving. From January to mid-July of this year, more than 20 million yuan has been collected, which is several times more than the previous tax revenue. The bureau, in view of the fact that a portion of business establishments in the first category of profit-making income tax have been late in filing, has selected cadres to implement account audits and collections house-by-house, street-by-street, and industry-by-industry. If various businesses delay in filing, make false or concealed reports, refuse to audit accounts, or use the excuse of not having account books, the bureau will directly determine their tax liability in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and report to the judicial authorities to enforce the collection and execution of punishment in accordance with the Income Tax Punishment and Collection Execution Rules. Also, once the tax amount is determined, it should be paid within the time limit. If payment is delayed, a fine of up to one time the amount of tax owed will be imposed. It is heard that the bureau has now agreed with the city's courts on the implementation of punishment and collection methods. Also, the bureau believes that the period for the recovery of the two concessions is approaching, and is now planning to levy income tax on various foreign-owned businesses. It is estimated that this tax revenue will definitely be considerable in the future, benefiting the national treasury in no small way.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Taxpayer Association – Chen Jicheng Proposes a Plan</h3>
<p>Chen Jicheng, chairman of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai Municipal Council, believes that the Taxpayers' Association has gloriously resisted the oppressive forces of Britain and the United States in the past few years. Now that the concessions have been recovered, there is actually nothing to do. If the association is to be dissolved, it would be a great pity. It is heard that Mr. Chen is drafting a plan to change the name of the association and reorganize it, which can both preserve its glorious history and create new business. Once the plan is drafted, it will be submitted to the government for approval.</p>

<h3>Amidst the Unified Promotion of Charitable Undertakings: A Visit to the Poor and Sick Relief Association (Part 3) - The Organizational Structure of the Religious Relief Association</h3>
<p>So, how does the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association go about promoting and guiding the work of various charitable organizations? The person in charge of the association specifically introduced its organizational characteristics. The association is purely a non-governmental organization. All initiators are members. Any organization or individual that supports the association can become a member with the recommendation of three executive committee members. A general membership meeting is held every six months. Executive committee members are elected by the members (21 to 25 members). The executive committee elects seven standing committee members (Chairman: Wen Lanting; Vice Chairmen: Lin Kanghou and Yuan Ludeng; Committee Members: Wu Yunzhai, Xiang Kangyuan, and Guan Qun). A supervisory committee of seven to eleven members is also formed (Committee Members: Ding Houqing and Guo Shun). Under this upper-level organization, there is a secretary-general (Xiang Kuyuanshi), as well as secretaries and treasurers, to handle daily affairs. To promote various practical tasks, in addition to the executive and supervisory committee members, specialized committees such as advisory, fundraising, design, review, and fund management are established by the executive and supervisory committee members based on the importance of the tasks, to collaborate and develop the association's undertakings.</p>
<p>The first step, naturally, is fundraising, which is managed by the fundraising committee (Chairman: Zhao Jinqing; Vice Chairmen: Wu Yunzhai and Wang Boyuan). Fundraising is carried out in groups, with each group having a leader (selected from the committee members). Fundraising certificates are issued for all donations, with each booklet containing fifty sequentially numbered certificates. Each group leader reports on the fundraising results every half month. In addition, there are publicity and public relations groups to enhance the effectiveness of fundraising. Several banks, including Jincheng, Dalu, Shanghai, Xiye, Runqin, and Great Wall, as well as Fuyuan and Tongyuan pawnshops, are also engaged to collect donations. In addition to the fundraising committee, there is a fund management committee (Chairman: Ye Fuxiao; Vice Chairmen: Pei Yunqing and Zhu Boquan) specifically responsible for managing the funds. Except for payments submitted by the review committee and approved by the standing committee, no other expenses can be made. The use of donations must be approved by one of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the association's standing committee, one of the standing committee members, one of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the management committee, and the treasurer, who must jointly stamp the documents. To ensure prudence, the association has also established strict "accounting regulations." The purpose is to ensure that not a single cent of the money donated by the public is wasted, and that every cent is used effectively. At the same time, this can serve as a model for all charitable organizations, as a pioneer in improving future charitable undertakings, and to encourage people to donate generously.

<p>18,000 Shi of Rice from Suzhou, Yangzhou, and Huzhou Arrive in Shanghai; All 200,000 Shi Will Arrive Soon; 19th Phase of Rice Distribution in the City at One Sheng Per Capita</p>
<p>The Shanghai citizen's food problem, which is the focus of attention of the city's five million residents, has seen rumors quelled and the black market for rice suppressed, with public sentiment trending towards stability, due to the steady flow of rice from Suzhou, Yangzhou, and Huzhou. According to reporter investigations, the amount of rice that has already arrived in Shanghai has reached approximately 18,000 shi as of yesterday. The rice from the three areas is currently being transported by both land and water routes under a sound organizational structure.

<p>Lieutenant Saltian Elaborates on the Historical Significance of "Sea Day": A Deep Understanding of the Sea is Necessary for Any Nation Wishing to Become a World Power</p>
<p>The regular meeting hosted by the three Japanese authorities in Shanghai (Army, Navy, and Overseas Affairs) to entertain the Chinese press corps of this city was held yesterday (16th) at 3:00 PM at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, as usual. First, Lieutenant Saltian of the Combined Fleet Press Department gave a detailed explanation of the history and meaning of "Sea Day." Mr. Saltian began by saying, "The 20th of this month is Japan's Sea Day. We who live on land should have a deep understanding of land, sea, and air. Any nation wishing to become a world power must control the air and sea in addition to the land. Today, in the midst of the Great East Asia War, control of the sea is even more important. Therefore, we should have a deep understanding of the sea. Currently, the Japanese military has control over the vast Pacific and Indian Oceans, which fully demonstrates Japan's extraordinary naval power. We are pleased to celebrate the third Sea Day this year, and its significance is even greater. This year, in Japan, in order to further promote knowledge of the sea, the entire nation will celebrate as usual. In Shanghai, preparations are also underway for commemorative ceremonies, organized by the Shanghai branch of the Naval Association, the Shanghai Japanese Residents' Association, and the Naval懇話會 (Naval Round-Table Conference)." Then, Mr. Saltian expressed his hope that the Chinese people would also have a deep understanding of the sea and make contributions in this regard. Finally, he described the history of Sea Day, saying that in the Meiji 9th year, the Japanese Emperor toured northeastern Japan to gain a better understanding of the sea. After completing the tour on the 明治丸 (Meiji Maru), the ship returned safely to Yokohama. In recent years, the Japanese authorities' Maritime Affairs Bureau, recognizing the importance of 梅, has taken charge of the development of the sea and sought to make people deeply aware of it. Therefore, it was decided that the day of the Meiji Emperor's tour should be designated as a commemorative date to promote the spirit and ideas, and to deeply understand and respect the hard work and achievements of sailors. Therefore, it was specifically designated as a national commemorative ceremony, which has now been celebrated for many years.</p>
<h3>Citywide Sugar Sales to Begin on the 21st</h3>

The quantity will remain at half a jin per person, and the selling price will be 2.35 yuan. All other procedures will be exactly the same as in previous phases.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Admitting Patients to Epidemic Hospitals</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that summer has arrived and public and private epidemic hospitals have been established in this city, the Bureau of Health has specifically stipulated the following provisional supplementary measures for admitting epidemic patients to facilitate strict management: (1) After admitting an epidemic patient, a form should be filled out and reported to the Bureau immediately, or directly reported to the affiliated agencies of the Bureau nearby (such as health offices, health affairs offices, municipal hospital clinics, etc.) so that personnel can be dispatched quickly to carry out disinfection procedures. (2) After the patient is admitted to the hospital, a stool test should be performed promptly, and the test results should be reported to the Bureau in detail. When the patient recovers and is discharged from the hospital, the stool must be tested more than twice before discharge is allowed. After a patient dies, it is best to cremate the body immediately. If burial is desired, the burial site designated by the Bureau must be approved. It must be far away from residences and water sources, the pit must be seven feet deep, lime must be sprinkled inside and outside the coffin and in the burial pit, the coffin seams should be sealed, the coffin lid should be five feet below the ground, and the soil should be restored. At that time, the Bureau of Health will also send personnel to supervise the household to carry out the above-mentioned necessary procedures.</p>

<p>The charitable exhibition of calligraphy and painting for relief in North China, organized by this newspaper, has been open for five days since its opening. Despite the sweltering heat and heavy rain, the number of visitors every day is still endless, which shows the great concern of people from all walks of life for charitable undertakings. We are truly gratified. In order to broaden the appeal and widely arouse the resonance of the community for the victims of the disaster in North China, a handbook on the disaster in North China and its relief is distributed to visitors at the visitor registration desk. We hope that visitors will pay attention to it. In order to thank all the visitors for their enthusiasm and slightly add to their elegant interests, in addition to inviting the famous calligrapher Mr. Qian Hailong to be on duty at the site and write for guests, we have specially invited the famous painters Chen Penglu and Honglu brothers to come to the exhibition after 3:00 PM every day to write and paint on the spot. Yesterday, each of them painted a landscape fan, with clear brushstrokes and refined techniques, which made people marvel. The younger generation is promising and the future is unlimited. Today, at 3:00 PM, we will invite famous calligraphers and painters in Shanghai, Deng Chunshu, Deng Rong, Shi Piao, Gao Yehou, Ding Fuzhi, Shi Jia, Miao Guying, and Zou Bangyan, and Zhujun to come to the meeting. All circles of society are welcome to visit and pre-order. In recent days, there has been enthusiastic pre-ordering of calligraphy, paintings, and charity exhibits. The genuine silk robes and valuable fabrics such as Xin Tiao Ni, which were generously donated by the Daqing Silk Shop a few days ago, were purchased by the movie stars Wang Yin and Yuan Meiyun for the highest price of 56,410 yuan yesterday. The calligraphy left by General Wu Peifu, which was displayed on the site, has been pre-ordered by Mr. Chen for 5,000 yuan. The horizontal scroll by Wen Tianxiang of the Ming Dynasty has also been pre-ordered by Mr. Wu for 5,000 yuan. If anyone is willing to offer a higher price, the two gentlemen are also willing to transfer it. We hope that people from all walks of life will visit and bid enthusiastically.</p>

<h3>Huatong Cup Charitable Football Tournament: Lianyi to Face Sao Paolo in Opening Match Today at 6:00 PM at Xuhui Stadium</h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang Yixin, president of the Huatong Sports Association, promoted summer football and donated the ticket revenue to the Tongtong Orphanage. He initiated the Huatong Cup Chinese-Western Charitable Football Tournament, inviting the two giants of the football world, Lianyi and the Sao Paolo Alliance, to compete in a three-game, two-win series. The first match is scheduled for 6:00 PM today at the Xuhui Middle School Stadium. The second match will be held at the same venue next Wednesday (21st). To make the event more grand, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Deputy Kui of the Public Works Department, will perform the opening kick-off ceremony today. Tickets are 20 yuan. During the intermission, the match ball will be auctioned. Mr. Jiang will also donate a trophy to the winning team. This battle is not only based on charitable motives but is also a battle for the leadership of football in this city. Currently, among Western football teams, Sao Paolo and Sao Francisco are considered to be the best. The essence of the first-class foreign generals has been gathered here. This time, they have joined forces to fight side by side, and their strength should not be underestimated. Today's battle is naturally a big enemy for Lianyi. However, Lianyi will fight with the most standard lineup today. In addition, Song Lingsheng's leg injury has recovered, and he can play today. The best central defender in the Far East is finally complete and flawless. At the same time, Zhang Lingen's big-foot style, matched with Li Tiansheng, has its own merits in terms of speed. They are not worried about the Sao Paolo's fierce offensive. In addition, Gao Baozheng and Fei Chunhua are both in their best state. Wu Qixiang has been transferred to the left wing, and he can cooperate tacitly with the two veterans, A Li and Lao Sun, and exert their magical martial arts. It can be expected that they will defeat the enemy and overcome the results, washing away the old shame of Donglian, and the excitement of the process is self-evident. In this post-season scenery, such a grand event is rare, and it is expected that the grand occasion on Xuhui Road today will be unprecedented. This charity match has been greatly supported by celebrities Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and Jian Jiaqi, and their kindness and righteousness are admirable. If it rains today, you can call Xuhui Middle School at 74929 at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The audience can take public bus route 22 in the French Concession or tram route 2 of the French Concession to reach the school directly. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Lianyi</p>
<p>Liu Haohan</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Zhang Lingen</p>
<p>Qu Yongfu Song Lingsheng Zheng Yingquan</p>

<h3>Mr. Yamada and Mr. Ueno Met with Magazine Industry Representatives Yesterday, Hoping to Promote Cultural Exchanges between China and Japan</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Mr. Yamada Kenkichi, managing director of the Japan Greater East Asia Publishing Company, and Mr. Ueno Iwao, director of the Greater East Asia Publishing Culture Research Institute, have been quite busy with social engagements since arriving in Shanghai a few days ago. The newspaper held a tea party to entertain the two gentlemen, introducing them to people from the Shanghai press circles for a cordial exchange of ideas. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Since the publishing and cultural industry is inseparable from the magazine industry, and it has significant implications for cultural exchanges between China and Japan, this newspaper once again held a tea party at the Asia Building at 5:00 PM yesterday, introducing the two gentlemen to colleagues from the magazine industry in this city. Those who attended included Mr. Yamada and Mr. Ueno, as well as magazine industry representatives Zhou Shoujuan, Liu Yusheng, Tao Kangde, Yang Guangzheng, Ye Deming, and Ren Yunpeng, representative of the Magazine Federation, and others, more than ten people in total. During the event, Mr. Chen, president of this newspaper, introduced the magazine industry representatives one by one.</p>
<p>Ueno's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Ueno gave a speech, saying: "We are grateful to Mr. Chen, president of Shen Bao, for introducing us to people from the press yesterday, and we are very honored to be able to meet with representatives from the Shanghai magazine publishing house today. We have long known that Shanghai is the cultural center of China, and the magazine representatives are the best in the magazine industry. Therefore, we hope to hear the insights of authoritative figures in the magazine industry, so that we can learn from them. In today's wartime, the gentlemen of the magazine industry have worked hard in their positions and fulfilled their missions, which is truly admirable. We hope that you will give us your valuable experience and superior achievements as a guide for our publishing industry and the magazine industry. This time, we came to China to investigate the cultural publishing industry in your country. After completing our task in Shanghai, we will go to Nanjing, Beijing, and other places to inspect. Although we will be separated from you, there will still be opportunities to meet in the future. However, today's opportunity is rare. We hope that all of you will express your opinions and expectations for the Japanese magazine industry. We will convey them one by one to the people and cultural circles in our country." Finally, he mentioned that he regretted not being able to meet with the Chinese representative, Mr. Liu Yusheng, at the opening of the Tokyo Writers' Conference last year due to his duties.</p>
<p>Liu Yusheng's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Liu Yusheng said: "It is a great pleasure to meet Mr. Ueno and Mr. Yamada this time. Although the Greater East Asia Publishing Company and the Cultural Publishing Research Institute have not been established for long, they are progressing very smoothly. I believe that they will make a significant contribution to the cultural relationship between China and Japan. First of all, we should thank the two of you. I think the two gentlemen know very well the general situation of the magazine industry in Shanghai before meeting with us. There are dozens of magazines published in Shanghai, among which, in addition to one or two magazines with a long history, most of them were founded after the Sino-Japanese Incident. There were even more publications after the Great East Asia War and the participation of the national government in the war. Therefore, whether specialized or general, they are directly or indirectly suitable for the wartime system and exert their functions and strength. Therefore, we believe that all cultural magazines must be more profound in their thinking in addition to their practical performance, in order to gain universal understanding and sympathy. This is what we actively hope to achieve. From the surface, Sino-Japanese cooperation in politics is one thing, and the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese cultural circles is another, but in fact, they are equally important. Therefore, we hope that the magazine industry will work harder. We can trace back to the remarks of the Chinese cultural circles on Sino-Japanese relations after September 18, 1931, which have lost their understanding. Only Xu Zunlin's "Enemy or Friend?" and Chen Binsu's "On Chiang Kai-shek" can best understand the Sino-Japanese relationship. We hope that cultural colleagues will conduct in-depth research on Sino-Japanese relations and move towards this path."</p>
<p>Ye Deming's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Ye Deming expressed his opinion, saying that one of the four major綱領 (guiding principles) of the East Asia League is cultural communication, but the general Japanese habit is to think that cultural thought and politics cannot be linked together, while the Chinese think that cultural thought cannot be separated from politics. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, ideological movements have never left politics. If it leaves politics for a day, it will inevitably lose touch with reality and end in failure. For example, in the eyes of the Chinese, the Greater East Asia Publishing Company and the Cultural Publishing Research Institute must be linked to politics. In the future, after the two of you inspect Nanjing and Beijing, you will definitely discover this phenomenon. Secondly, the East Asia League movement is still in the initial stage of development in China. From its history and development process, it has eliminated the divisions of parties. Chairman Wang of the National Government has announced that this movement is China's national policy and a concrete development of the Three People's Principles. However, articles by the Japanese cultural and publishing circles on this movement, whether supporting or opposing it, rarely mention it. I hope that in the future, we can understand each other and work together based on the point of cultural communication. Finally, I hope that the Japanese cultural circles can introduce not only the old culture of thousands of years ago, but also the new culture of reality in their introduction to Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Yang Guangzheng's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Yang Guangzheng expressed his opinion on the issue of cultural thought, saying that China and Japan have the conditions for cooperation in terms of geography, culture, and bloodline. However, the transition of thought is even more important. Therefore, if the thought of the Sino-Japanese relationship is transformed, in-depth cooperation can of course be carried out, and we can help each other. However, the realization of this thought must be mutual understanding and mutual equality. There can be great achievements. Many people think that cultural communication between China and Japan must first start with language. However, it is not difficult for us to recall that famous Chinese writers who studied in Japan, such as Guo Moruo, Yu Dafu, and Tian Han, were very fluent in Japanese. However, due to ideological issues, they could not join our camp. Therefore, communication in language alone is not enough. The most important thing is the communication of thought and spirit. In short, the Sino-Japanese relationship cannot simply express friendship on the surface. It must be observed from the people's spirit and heart. Everyone should be honest with each other, frankly point out shortcomings, and have sincere understanding. Furthermore, a thorough communication in culture, thought, and spirit will enable the people of the two countries to accept the highest reality of the Greater East Asia, which is not glorious.</p>
<p>Zhou Shoujuan's Speech</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou Shoujuan, the former leader of the Chinese magazine industry, expressed his aspirations, saying that in addition to his love for literature and art, he also loves gardening, and he admires Japanese bonsai and flower arrangement. In the past, he founded the "Bonsai Magazine" to introduce Chinese and Japanese bonsai. To this day, there are still many precious photos of this kind. Recalling twenty years ago, a certain magazine published in Shanghai translated a book written by a 人 (person), "The Weakness of the Motherland," which is a patriotic novel. The translator was Mr. Taogawa. This is what I am proud of. I hope that we can thoroughly cooperate in culture in the future. Finally, he also talked about the situation of the Japanese publishing industry and the life of cultural people. According to him, Japanese newspapers only sell for five or six yuan, which is very different from the situation in China, where paper is as expensive as洛阳纸贵 (Luoyang paper is expensive). Therefore, there are many publications, and all printing houses are overwhelmed with work, and all are by reservation. The income of cultural people is higher than that of Chinese writers. Each page of about 400 words averages about 10 yuan in Japanese currency. The price of rice is extremely low, with each dou (equivalent to two dou in China) selling for only 5 yuan in Japanese currency, which makes people's lives stable and the cultural undertaking extremely prosperous. After a pleasant conversation, everyone dispersed at seven o'clock.</p>
<h3>Chen Ziyi's Family Secret Recipe for Mania and Epilepsy</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Ziyi of Yutian has a family secret recipe for the special treatment of madness and epilepsy. The Babao Dingshen Dan, which has been publicly sold in Shanghai, has achieved remarkable results and cured many people.

The sales office is Chen Yunzhen Tang, No. 3 Cun, Yongli Fang, Tongfu Road, Shanghai. Detailed instructions will be mailed upon request with postage.</p>
<p>Economic Review</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Market Today</h3>
<p>Not many days ago, we said that the recent surge in prices in Shanghai has exceeded the scope of economic issues and become politically charged because "speculative hoarders are deliberately spreading planned rumors about the recent political situation." As a result, the underground market prices of important commodities are becoming increasingly rampant behind the scenes, which the authorities do not allow to be published, to the point of being uncontrollable, and the people's lives are falling into deep water and fire. As a result, the boiling of prices has led to the boiling of popular resentment. And the elements behind the rumors are exactly as they wished!</p>
<p>To encourage a comprehensive rise in prices, the spreading of rumors is used as an invisible tool, the meaning of which is to depreciate the value of the national currency and increase the threat to people's lives. As for the tangible tools, the most important one is to take advantage of the foolish idea that the people hold about money not being able to be separated from gold, and the bad phenomenon that various markets in Shanghai still follow the gold market. The price of gold is secretly raised, making it rise again and again without end, setting off a fierce surge in the entire Shanghai market, causing the people to sigh that they cannot guarantee their lives in their daily lives, and making themselves reap the profits of the fisherman, while others suffer from rumors. This situation is the Shanghai market today! This situation is the phenomenon that continues to exist in the声中 (midst) of the recovery of the concession!</p>
<p>The Shanghai market today is like a fire about to burn out the prairie. It must be extinguished quickly, otherwise, the economic future of Shanghai is unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Stagnation in the Money Exchange Business; Numerous Reorganizations into Banks, Trading Firms, and Tobacco Shops</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Exchange Association's member money shops are still in a stagnant state of business. Many are reorganizing into banks, remittance money shops, or tobacco shops. The Qianlian Bank, jointly established by the industry, has shareholders mostly from the money exchange business, and its transactions are also primarily with money exchange firms. The business situation is generally good. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Depressed Business</p>
<p>Before the incident (likely referring to a war or major event), there was a small amount of foreign currency trading, but business was mediocre. In the two years after the war, because the various markets had not returned to normal, trading in government bonds, stocks, gold, cotton yarn, and foreign currencies became popular. The industry saw many people making large profits, and new businesses sprang up like mushrooms after rain, increasing from over a hundred to more than two hundred. This was the golden age of the money exchange business. However, after the authorities cracked down on speculation, banned black market trading, and the Greater East Asia War broke out, with the subsequent cessation of circulation and trading of British and American currencies, the industry suffered a sharp decline. The business of each shop almost completely stopped. To date, sixty or seventy shops have stopped operating, reorganized into banks, remittance money shops, or tobacco shops. Only about one hundred and fifty shops remain.</p>
<p>Reorganization into Banks</p>
<p>After the money exchange businesses withdrew from the money market and formed their own association, their structures became similar to those of banks and money shops. In addition to running schools, libraries, and barbershops, they first organized a Money Exchange Clearing House and then a Joint Reserve of Money Exchange Businesses, to manage inter-firm check clearing, collection, and transfer. Not long after, the Clearing House was shut down, leaving only the Reserve. In the spring of this year, the businesses agreed to reorganize the Reserve into Qianlian Bank. The bank's capital is two million yuan, jointly invested by the businesses. When the Ministry of Finance ordered both the banking and money industries to increase their total capital, the industry, for the convenience of inter-firm transactions, the board of directors has resolved to increase capital, and a special shareholders' meeting will be convened on the 24th of this month to discuss the amount of the increase. After a decision is made, the procedures will be followed to apply for approval from the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Strict Enforcement of Price Controls on Cotton Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>According to inquiries made by a Shanghai News Agency reporter from cotton cloth industry sources, the current inventory of cotton yarn and cloth in this city is still relatively abundant, sufficient for several years of need in Central China. The industry association has decided to strictly prohibit its member businesses from selling above the price limits. All businesses must mark the price limits when selling at retail. If any violations occur, all parties can report and inform on them for investigation. At the same time, those shipping to other areas must first apply to the association for a certificate according to regulations. This certificate must specify: (1) the name of the business; (2) the address; (3) the name of the manager; (4) the destination; (5) the name of the receiving business; (6) the type of cotton yarn and cloth; (7) the total quantity; (8) the manufacturer; (9) the trademark; and (10) the origin and destination. After the certificate is stamped by the association, a transportation permit can be obtained from the Materials Permit Office of the Commercial Control General Association. For non-association members, and if the cotton yarn and cloth have not been registered with the relevant parties, permits will be refused. It is understood that most of the current shipments of cotton cloth are for winter use, and the destinations include Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, and Songjiang. Yesterday, someone familiar with the cloth industry also said that in the last two or three months, the establishment of small cotton cloth shops has been like bamboo shoots after the rain, many using "three-plus discount" as a slogan. Therefore, their daily business is no less than that of large cotton cloth shops. However, these businesses have relatively small capital and limited stock. The Cotton Industry Association previously announced that all businesses should use the city ruler as the standard for measurement to ensure uniformity and compliance with industry regulations.</p>
<h3>Extension of Deadline for Registration of Flour and Wheat Merchants</h3>
<p>The control of flour and wheat under the Commercial Control Association system has made significant progress in practice since the Executive Yuan approved the wheat unified purchasing plan and new wheat from various production areas has been introduced. After the members of the Chinese Grain Industry Association, flour and wheat merchants, and Japanese flour milling associations have registered their qualifications and trading, the unified control process will be easier to implement. However, since the start of this registration, some flour and wheat merchants have not been able to complete their qualification registration for understandable reasons. To fully protect the rights and interests of all merchants, the registration deadline is extended to the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills to Start Production After Wheat Purchase is Completed</h3>
<p>After the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Commercial Control General Association decided on the wheat purchase plan, it negotiated a wheat loan of 100 million yuan with Chinese and Japanese banking circles and decided to establish branch offices in major production areas to supervise the wheat purchase. It is now understood that the first step of the branch offices, the qualification registration procedures for wheat shops, vendors, commissioned merchants, and flour milling manufacturers in various places, has been completed. Various merchants have begun purchasing wheat in various production areas at the established prices. It is expected that the purchase work will be completed by the end of this month. It is said that the Fufeng Flour Mill in this city and various Chinese and Japanese flour milling plants in the interior are repairing their machinery and will start producing flour separately in mid-August.</p>
<h3>Estimated Purchases of Corn and Sorghum in Central China</h3>
<p>The Oil and Grain Committee has estimated the possible purchase amount of corn and sorghum in various regions of Central China this year: corn is estimated at 50,000 to 100,000 dan in Chongming District, 150,000 dan in Qingpu District, 10,000 dan in the Nantong-Zhenjiang area, 150,000 dan in the Wuhu area, 100,000 dan in the Anqing area, and 30,000 dan in the Tonghai area. Sorghum is estimated at 50,000 dan in the northern Anhui area and 50,000 dan in the Yangzhou-Taidong area, totaling 490,000 to 450,000 dan of corn and 100,000 dan of sorghum.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Work of the Chinese Economic Research Society</h3>
<p>The Chinese Economic Research Society is an economic research organization initiated and organized by Zhou Zuomin, Wu Zhen, Tang Shoumin, Li Shengbo, and other people from the economic circles of this city. It is located in the Bank of China on Chengdu Road and Yanan Road. Although it has been established for only a few months, its work has been quite active. The society has a research department responsible for collecting actual materials, conducting surveys and statistics, and editing. In addition, three specialized committees on finance, industry, and trade are set up, with experts from various fields in this city jointly responsible for the implementation of the work. The inaugural issue of the society's "Chinese Economic Bi-monthly," has now been published. Important papers include "On Double Personality and the Financial Market," "Trade and Exchange in North and Central China," "Exchange Under Controlled Economy," and "Economic History of the Qing Dynasty," all of which are novel and informative.</p>
<h3>Stock Market Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after a sharp rise, the Chinese stock market suddenly saw a sharp fall. The sentiment turned from firm to weak. The price of gold plummeted, and stock prices were too high, weakening buying power. Sellers automatically lowered prices, and around noon, supply exceeded demand, and a downtrend began. Although still higher than the previous day, the future is not optimistic, and the market remains chaotic. Yong'an, Xinxin, Guohuo (domestic goods) three department stores, and Da Lai Yi, all fell after reaching new highs. Jinglun and Jingfu shirt and socks stocks were also rising. Yong'an Textiles fluctuated within a narrow range. Rongfeng Textiles showed a slight upward trend. The small-face-value Da Zhonghua Weaving rose to the hurdle. Guoxin, Guoguang, and Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing continued to rise. Nanyang Tobacco Company stood firm outside the hurdle. Da Zhonghua Matches suddenly rose. Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric rose. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Sino-French Pharmacy saw another sharp increase. New Asia Pharmaceutical once broke through a hurdle. Xinyi, Wuzhou, and Four Star perfumes all saw transactions, and prices jumped sharply. The buying and selling prices of the cultural industry companies Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, and World Book Company differed greatly. Various other small-face-value stocks were suddenly favored by investors, such as Jiu'an Industrial, Da Zhonghua Industrial, Xinyi Real Estate, Tongyi Trust, Zhongxing Wood Industry, China Clock Factory, Defeng Knitting, Xin'ya Construction, and Bao'an Glass, all of which rose. China Brick and Tile, and Kangyuan Canning also saw strong increases.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: The market price and handling fees for gold in silver shops remain the same, but no goods are available for exchange. Outside the industry, the price is chaotic, once exceeding the hurdle before falling back and entering the hurdle again. The price of silver has risen significantly and is about to hit the hurdle.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: The rise in the price of matches has reached a fever pitch, leading to repeated new highs. Soap and candles struggled at high levels but ultimately also rose. Cigarettes have also risen in price due to market dryness, with Great Britain leading the way. Other brands also saw sharp increases.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lacquer Industry Association held its inaugural meeting at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. More than one hundred representatives from the Economic Bureau, the City Chamber of Commerce, and member representatives attended. The articles of association were approved, and elections were held. Ye Rixuan and nine others were elected as directors, and Zhang Nanyuan and five others were elected as supervisors, all of whom were sworn into office on the same day.</p>

<h3>Those Who "Know the Times"</h3>
<p>— Zhi Wu</p>
<p>Stubborn, old-fashioned people who are stuck in their ways, ignorant of reason, and headstrong are not only making a mistake in terms of the times, but will eventually be abandoned by the torrent of the times.</p>
<p>The Book of Changes says: "How divine is it to know the opportune moment!" A great opportunity is rare and fleeting. Therefore, "those who know the times are outstanding." In life, being able to recognize and grasp the times is the secret to success in a great career.</p>
<p>Therefore, historically, ambitious people have always acted when the opportunity arises and moved when the time is right, never acting rashly. Confucius was a sage of the times who acted when he could and stopped when he could. He appeared when the state was well-governed and disappeared when it was not. He only knew how to protect himself wisely and never went with the flow. As for wise people like Zhang Liang, he was an example of someone who "knew the times." He knew that Liu Bang could share hardship but not prosperity. Therefore, after he had exhausted his loyalty and helped Liu Bang establish the Han Dynasty, he retired to avoid future trouble. Fan Zeng, on the other hand, was unenlightened. He did not leave Chu when Xiang Yu killed Qingzi Champion, but wanted to rely on Xiang Yu to seek fame and fortune. When he finally left, it was too late. This was the result of his "not knowing the times."</p>
<p>Time, time, does not come again! Therefore, those who "know the times" will always steer with the wind, make decisive decisions, and take advantage of the momentum, never going against the tide of the times.</p>
<h3>Returning from Japan (II)</h3>
<p>— Sheng Yudu</p>
<p>Men and Women Fulfill Their Duties</p>
<p>The government and people of that country are indeed in a state of war, and what touched me most deeply was the people's obedience and spirit of cooperation. The people of that country absolutely obey the government's orders and do not evade the law to seek advantage. Everyone is self-reliant and sacrifices enjoyment. Men are naturally like this, and women also have this spirit. Those who serve society work outside, while those who manage the family toil inside. They are by no means comparable to those who only apply makeup and consume without producing anything. In short, under wartime conditions, the government's thorough control, the frugality of resources, and the people's fulfillment of their duties, love of country, loyalty to the emperor, and spirit of cooperation with the government are truly a wake-up call to our people. Shanghai has undergone several changes, and dangers have arisen, but it has safely passed through to this day, which is extremely fortunate. However, the future is long, and such fortune is unsustainable. It can happen once, but not again; it can be temporary, but not permanent. If everyone harbors a mentality of luck and rushes to the field of speculation, those who are fortunate enough to succeed will squander their wealth extravagantly, while those who are unlucky will take risks to gamble everything, ultimately losing their families and lives, leading to an irreversible situation. The impact on the country's future and the harm to social security are unimaginable.</p>
<p>The People Should Wake Up</p>
<p>I believe that the nation's struggle for survival and fight for freedom cannot be accomplished by the power of those in government alone. The key lies in the progress of each individual citizen. Gather the strength of each unit to become the strength of the government, and maintain the order of each individual to become the order of society. I hope that the citizens of Shanghai will wake up as soon as possible, abandon their mentality of luck and complacency, and think for the country and for society. The most tempting thing is today's speculative business, hoarding and speculation, which not only harms the country and society, but also has a cyclical harm to themselves. Because the financial resources of a few people are limited, the types of goods they hoard must be very few, and they cannot hoard all the necessities of life at once.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say eliminate luck, reject complacency, and start from the individual, from small things, and build and operate through legitimate means. More production means cultivating more vitality for the country, and saving more resources means storing more strength for the country. Today's sacrifice is tomorrow's enjoyment, today's pain is tomorrow's happiness. Conversely, today's complacency is tomorrow's pain, and today's enjoyment is tomorrow's sacrifice. Although this trip was short, I have many feelings, and I use this to describe the outline, hoping that people will learn from each other's strengths to make up for their own weaknesses. People must help themselves before others help them, and then heaven will help them. I am willing to encourage the citizens of Shanghai together! (The End)</p>
<h3>Chicken</h3>
<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>She got up, put on her clothes, and ran outside. She glanced at her father sitting on a stool, lost in thought. She couldn't remember much of the chaotic scene she had seen last night after falling asleep.</p>
<p>"Dad! You're up so early! I have three eggs. Dad can take them to town to exchange for some cooking oil." Xiu Bao said, making a "cluck, cluck, cluck" sound, preparing to open the chicken coop and let the chickens out. A hen rushed out, some spreading their wings, some stretching their legs, some relieving themselves, each doing their morning chores. Xiu Bao grabbed a handful of wheat and scattered it on the ground. The hens scrambled to eat it. A Kun silently watched the chickens, more deeply recalling the scene from last night, which deepened the wounds in his heart.</p>
<p>"Oh no! Dad! This isn't good! The guy in the gray cloth clothes from yesterday is back! Look!" Xiu Bao suddenly exclaimed, pointing to two people in gray cloth clothes walking towards their house from the south. The one in front recognized the little fellow who had come yesterday for the chickens. Behind him was a tall man. A Kun raised his head, trying to identify them. In a moment, they had already reached the courtyard. A Kun's heart beat wildly. He expected misfortune to come again! Although he felt hatred, he didn't have the courage to express it!</p>
<p>Several hens were still vying for the scattered wheat, clucking, clucking. They didn't know that misfortune would soon befall them. The little fellow in gray cloth had already spotted the plump hen he had seen yesterday and turned to the tall man, smacking his lips without saying a word.</p>
<p>"Good! A good plump chicken, grab it back and we can have a feast!" the tall man shouted, and started to grab it. The little fellow helped to block the chickens. In a flurry of steps, the hens clucked wildly. Finally, they caught two of them. The poor hens struggled and cried desperately in their hands, but this time there was no way to save them.</p>
<p>"No! No! I won't! My hens are laying eggs! We need them to get oil and salt! No! I won't!" Xiu Bao continued to cry and shout. She stepped forward to snatch them back, but the tall man handed one of the chickens in his right hand to the little fellow, and slapped Xiu Bao, leaving a red mark on her face. Xiu Bao fell to the ground, rolling and crying madly!</p>
<p>"Damn it! I want to eat chicken, I don't care if you want to! If you were a few years older, I'd take you away too, ha! ha! ha! Let's go!" The tall man hummed, a triumphant smile on his face, and walked back the way he came, holding the hen. Xiu Bao was still lying on the ground, crying and shouting loudly.</p>
<p>A Kun sat on a stool nearby, a mix of anger and sorrow, numbing his heart. He vividly remembered the story from last night, how could he dare to say anything? He watched helplessly as they swaggered away, and as Xiu Bao cried and shouted, thinking about the hens! ... the eggs! ... the silver thread! ... the Field Army! ... aiding bandits! ... hiding guns! ... He was even more stupid than a wooden chicken! (The End)</p>

<h3>Recording the North China Emergency Relief Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Dong Gangxiong</p>
<p>On the 15th, I took a car to the fourth floor of No. 12, The Bund to visit the North China Emergency Relief Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition, which I had admired for days. Upon entering, I signed my name and received a catalog and a compilation of Shen Bao editorials and relief news, calling on the entire country to help the disaster victims in North China. I truly admire the thoughtfulness of the organizers.</p>
<p>Passing through a corridor is the charity exhibition hall. Upon entering, I saw many people coming and going, vying to purchase the works. Suddenly, I saw Mr. Lin Kang was also there. His energetic demeanor was truly admirable. In this hot summer, it is truly rare for Mr. to participate in bidding.</p>
<p>Today, I feel very honored to have received Mr. Kang's own "Doing Good is the Greatest Joy," as well as Mr. Qian Hailong's, the child prodigy, "Righteousness and Brilliance," and Mr. Huang Jingwan's autographed work. I am extremely honored. Here, I earnestly urge all sectors of society to participate enthusiastically and contribute to this good cause, so that our suffering compatriots in North China can leave the sea of suffering as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Dr. Shen Donates Medicine</h3>
<p>Dr. Shen Zhongru donated 1,000 packets and 100 bottles of "Sha" medicine to this newspaper yesterday, instructing us to forward them to the poor and sick. We will do so immediately. Dr. Shen's clinic also has medicine to donate. If there are any extremely poor people, they can be introduced by this newspaper, and consultation fees will be waived. The clinic is located at No. 163 Laodagu Road (west end of Marius Vegetable Market).</p>
<h3>Charity School and Scholarship Assistance</h3>
<p>Starting from the next semester, Qipu Road, Xintangjia Lane Private Qicheng Primary School, in addition to the original free and reduced fees, has received a donation from school director Mr. Wu Jinling to fund 20 free students. This newspaper can recommend all of them.</p>
<p>Yingshe, at No. 87A Xujiahui Road, Xuhong Road, has admitted many students through its scholarship committee to study at Jiangdong Middle School (No. 232 Fuxu Road). There are still three openings for junior high school students. This newspaper can recommend three people (who must live near Jiangdong School) to study at the school, and all tuition and fees will be paid on their behalf.</p>
