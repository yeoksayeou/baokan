<h3 id="c1">保衛太平洋的新任務　國人應急起直追增進海軍知識 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>太平洋是亞細亞人的太平洋，太平洋要由亞洲人自己來保衛。歷史上太平洋遭受嚴重的威脅，都是由日本海軍的艱苦作戰來解除的。第一次是三十八年前（一九〇四—一九〇五年）前的日俄戰爭，第二次就是現在勝利進行中的大東亞戰爭。在第一次戰爭中，帝俄企圖掀起對外戰爭，以消滅其國內的革命勢力，維持其專制的統治，並進而擊敗日本，併呑滿洲與華北，與列强競分中國。幸賴日本於維新運動之後，國力躍進，士氣昂揚，特別是新海軍勢力　養成，旅順港外及日本海之戰，擊敗了帝俄名震世界的遠征東亞的大艦隊，奠定了日俄戰爭中日本勝利的基礎。　本海軍的威名，也從此揚聲於世界七大洋。這是太平洋國家海軍最光榮的歷史。第二次，在大東亞戰爭中，日本海軍於一九四一年十二月八日開戰之初，一舉而覆滅美國稱覇太平洋的海軍前哨陣地夏威夷珍珠港，進而又有香港，馬來，馬尼拉，新加坡及爪哇等不斷的捷報，使一向在世界海軍中佔有絕對優越地位的英美海軍，遭受了致命的打擊與殲滅，從此自甘退守，希圖苟全旦夕而不可得。日本海軍這種動業，在未來的世界史上，顯然要佔最重要的地位。不過，我們要認淸，敵人的勢力並未完全肅淸，也未遭遇澈底的殲滅，要保持已經獲得的勝利，要鞏固太平洋上的防衛，使敵人永遠不敢偷渡太平洋，不但需要日本海軍之更大的努力，而且還需要一切東亞國家建立起海軍力量來，在日本海軍的領導之下，担負起各自天賦的職責。在這裏，中國自然有其極關重大的地位。</p>
<p>中國是一個大陸國家，一向也以陸軍兵員數目之龐大著稱於世，然而，就地理和戰略的形勢而言，中國實在也是一個海洋的國家，我們的國土東部，東南，南部和西南國境，自渤海灣繞山東半島，經黃海，東海，沿蘇，浙，閩，粵諸省，歷南海而至於東京灣，海岸綫之綿長，在東亞各國，實居於第一位，在這海岸綫上，分佈着的，自上海以下，都是我國第一等現代化的大都市，更在長江，珠江的水路，沿岸遍佈主要城市，正是全國精華所在。因此，中國不言國防則已，如謂必需整備國防，那麼，今昔的形勢雖異，而國防的要義唯一，就是建立起眞正的海防，建立起强力的海軍。否則，侈言國防，似不免有自欺欺人之嫌。特別是在此大東亞戰爭中，我們是參戰的國家，實際上尙未動員大部力量，以協助日本作戰，從參戰的義務上說，我們不能不更加感到惶愧。不過，急起直追，時尙未晚，我們之所以喚起國人一切努力於海軍建設之硏究者，即在於此。</p>
<p>在這種重大的意義之下，我們特自即日起，以旬日爲期，摘載三十八年前本報關於日俄戰爭的紀載，和目前日本各著名報章雜誌關於日本海軍之所以勝利的記述，以期喚起國人硏究海洋與海軍之興趣，提供關於海洋與海軍的基本知識，促進我國海軍建設與海防建設運動，庶幾於保衛太平洋的新任務中，在不久的將來，我國亦能善盡自己的職責。如果因此有助於國家與大東亞戰爭之勝利，那更是不僅爲本報之幸而已了。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日俄戰役　三十八年前　本報之記載　舊報新抄（一） <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>引言</p>
<p>我們認淸今後保衛太平洋，將全是亞洲人的責任，再不容許英美揷足侵略勢力。不過，克盡保衛的任務，端賴强大的海軍力量。友邦日本建立海軍，歷數十年辛十勤經營，不斷精進。在三十八年前的日俄戰役中，以寡克衆，初露頭角。此次大東亞戰爭中，更發揮了所向無敵的威力。而目前太平洋整僩防務，由友邦海軍獨任艱鉅，我們未能稍爲分勞，殊深愧作，因此，我們今後將如何以友邦海軍爲模範，建立中國新海軍，參加防衛太平洋的任務，實爲國人所應共同急起直追的努力目標。本報爲增進國人海軍知識與興趣，特將三十八年前日俄戰爭時本報紀載，摘爲新抄，自廿一日至三十日止以十日爲期，尙祈讀者注意爲幸。</p>

<p>日前日本東京來函，謂日本自與俄人開戰，慕貸公債，以濟軍需，達官顯宦之好義急公者，無不爭先輸納，計古河潤吉獻日銀一百萬圓，井上馨·桂太郞各二百萬圓，田中光顯二萬五千圓，土方久元·渡邊千秋各一萬五千圓，花房義質·香川敬三·各一萬圓，外加各銀行之應募者：住友五百萬圓，鴻池三百萬圓，三十四二百萬圓，山口浪速大阪貯蓄北濱各二百萬圓，日本貯金二百萬圓，加滕七十萬圓，近江藤本各五十萬圓，三商木原五十八各二十萬圓，虎屋十五萬圓，積善同盟實業尾州工商櫻井各五十萬圓，川上五萬圓，川滿西六虎友古市富岡各二萬圓，葛城一萬圓。本館曾將此函照登於報，執筆人閱之，不禁喟然歎曰：日人之忠於國，而勇於義也，有如此哉？夫國家之興衰，視乎人心之向背，人人忠其君，愛其國，則無論何事，皆可以措置裕如。日本之興也，人人皆謂其維新之效，變政治，更律法，易服色，興學校，修軍實，講格致，精製造。始則學習泰西，繼乃收其功用。海東島國，向爲歐美列邦所輕視者，今乃可與頡頏，羣相敬服。自甲午戰勝中國後，其國勢益盛，其兵力益强。中國士大夫，莫不震而驚之，以爲中國惟不能維新，故孱弱至此；日本惟勇於維新，故强盛至此。吾以爲日本維新之效，誠哉如是矣。然抑知其興也，固有不徒恃維新，而人人忠其君，愛其國之效乎？人人知忠其君，愛其國，則團結一體，萬衆一心，祗知有君，而不知有己；祗知有國，而不知有家，忘已忘家，而任事自不覺其勇，處心亦自然無私。如是，則事事無不行以實心，運以實力，弊可以革，利可以興，而國乃臻於盛矣。固不徒今此與俄國開戰，其臣下慨然捐巨資，助軍費爲足見其忠君愛國也。然即此一事，巳足見日人之忠君，日人之愛國，宜乎其能與强俄相抗，奮其勇氣，摧折敵師，此後戮力同心，一戰而霸，亞洲牛耳，或執之日人手中，此亦未可逆料之事，而要自日人忠君愛國之心成之也。雖然十，吾因日人之忠君愛國，而以國興，吾即不能不感歎夫我中國。我中國之弱也，人人以爲不知變法，法誠變矣，而使全國人之心皆不注力於君與國，以言振興，徒見其紛擾而已；以言固結，徒見其渙散而已。欲望其轉弱爲强也，安可得乎？而况上之則臣無非欺蒙粉飾，侵公肥私，坐擁身家，而不知紓君父之難。下之則民無非鄙吝慳嗇，會計精工，自厚其資，而不知有輸將之義。故今臣下之富，有百萬者，有數百萬者；民間之常，有數萬者，有百萬者。而當此庫款支絀之際，曾不聞自願出其涓滴，以略助國家，是即移此戰事於中國，吾知國家即有借貸公債之意，亦斷不能如日人之急公好義也。嗚呼！人人不知忠君愛國，此吾中國孱弱之源，而不知精心毅力以行新政，猶其後焉者矣！我因論日人之好義，而連類及此，不禁爲之擲筆三歎，忸怩汗下焉！</p>

<p>— 伊藤正德</p>
<p>（一）兩提督的戰術</p>
<p>在第一次歐洲大戰時，參加旭德蘭海戰的英國兩提督琪利科和皮梯，都抱着英國式的個人主義，將英國的海軍，看做自己的艦隊。我們要批判這件事，還是從戰咚和戰術兩方面來指摘吧。代表前者的，是互相爭奪托瑪斯戰隊。</p>
<p>托瑪斯少將的第五戰隊，是由勃拉姆號，奧斯白特號，馬拉亞號，維利阿特號，（二七五〇〇噸，十五吋砲八門，二十五海里。）等四隻最新式戰艦所成立的。是當時世界最强的戰隊，這是人所共知的。而這戰隊，在旭德蘭海戰爆發的五日前（一九一六年五月二十六日），實在是琪利科主力艦隊的有力的一翼——決勝翼，極被重視。琪利科和東鄕元帥的在日本海海戰時依仗日進號春日號兩艦一樣，將信仰（是主力六隻中的兩隻，裝甲巡洋艦代爲戰艦。）寄託於這四隻最新式戰艦上。琪利科當時擁有二十八隻戰艦，其中十隻，主砲是十二吋砲，作爲中心的十一隻，是十三吋半砲（其他兩隻是十五吋砲，一隻是十四吋砲）；不過托瑪斯戰隊的四隻，都裝十五吋砲，速力誇稱二十五海里，所以是最重要的主力艦。這爲什麼歸於皮梯的呢？其中底細是很有趣味的。</p>
<p>（二）琪利科競爭失敗</p>
<p>歐洲大戰開始後，這精銳戰艦整頓好了（伊麗薩培斯王后級）；但是在此以前，早已發生了一個問題，就是：這快速戰艦應該屬於琪利科主力呢，還是屬於皮梯的巡戰艦隊？前者主張從艦型（戰艦）上說，常然應該做主力戰艦隊的中心勢力；反之：後者指出該戰隊的速力，自然爲與巡洋船艦隊合作而設計的。兩不相讓，海軍部，軍令部，都覺得左右爲難，但結果，決定照前一樣直屬琪利科。然而好勝的皮梯，心裏終不肯干休每有機會，主張托瑪斯戰隊的轉屬，在其所進的言辭中甚至含着相當激烈的語調</p>
<p>但到五月十二日，在洛賽斯舉行以海軍根據地問題爲中心的重要會議，海軍部長白爾福，琪利科，皮梯等三人相會，在會議上，皮梯自海軍部長和長官要求一定實行轉屬問題，再提督之間發生激烈的議論，展開了白爾福海長流汗仲裁的塲面。結果成立妥協案：的定琪利科命第五戰隊時常廻駛到洛賽斯（皮梯隊的根據地）去，參加聯合訓練；反之：第三巡洋戰艦戰隊）傳達少將的伊維西勃爾號以下三隻），廻駛到斯加巴夫洛，（琪利科主力的基地）去，同樣隨時訓練。</p>
<p>這就是英國式的妥協。這妥協的最惡劣的方面，在旭德蘭海戰的戰塲上暴露出來了。換言之托瑪斯戰隊五月二十六日駛進洛賽斯軍港，無暇經過正式的聨合訓練，就臨到三十一日的大海戰了。因此，皮梯隊和托瑪斯隊之間，沒有通過聲氣。托瑪斯隊雖是皮梯提督的最有力手臂，但不幸這不是自己的手臂，而是別人的手臂。在自己的神經出令的瞬息問，沒有動作，時常躭誤慣了。其結果，英軍錯過兩次好機會，而且皮梯隊招致兩隻大軍艦被擊沉的敗北。現在從戰術方面，簡單地來證明這事實吧。</p>
<p>（三）內鬨的因果報</p>
<p>下午兩點三十二分，皮梯向托瑪斯所揭的「韓向南南東」的信號，遲延了五分鐘始爲托瑪斯所瞧見，又經過三分鐘而方才實施。因此，兩隊的間隔從旣定的五海里離開到十海里了。這樣大的間隔，到後來有關於英軍的不利。其次，三點三十分當皮梯作戰鬥展開時，命令托瑪斯以「二十五海里的整個速力向束方（七七度）前進」。托瑪斯少將躊躇了一下。爲什麼呢。因爲德國的希勃戰隊正在實施二直角南轉中，從而戰鬥不在「東」，而在「南東」發生，這是必然的。但照長官的命令駛往東方（七七度），後來第三個信號才轉爲南東（一二二度）了。</p>
<p>等到這展開完畢，時問已遲，德英兩軍開始交戰，而且不多時，英艦伊維西勃爾號被擊沈了。托瑪斯戰隊遠望着那擊沈的黑燄瀰漫天空的慘狀，還沒有開過一砲參戰，雖則擁有德英兩軍中第一的巨砲十五吋砲，而却只是以整個速力急忙趕到戰塲上去。托瑪斯戰隊的旗艦勃拉姆號的砲火，好容易達到了德國殿後軍艦福台坦號，但時已在開戰後十分鐘了。這實在是極寳貴的十分鐘，也是英軍大損失的十分鐘。</p>
<p>若是日本的提督，怎麽辦呢？一定是不揭皮梯那樣的信號的。和三點三十分的方向速力的命令不同，只是命令道：「我立刻在南南束要求決戰，截斷敵人的退路。諸貴隊在最短時問內參戰！至急！」日本的長官，對於司令官級的提督，是不發微細的命令的。只述明自己的決戰意圖和攻擊方向，任其盡至善的努力，而萬一有不妥當的時俠，立刻採取修正指導的戰法。</p>
<p>然則站在托瑪斯少將的地位的日本司令官，怎麽稱呢？接到長官的前面所揭的命令而知道其意圖後，即於下午三點三十分，轉到右方，爲要在二十分鐘後向可以預料的戰塲上驀進，在南南束越過皮梯主力的後方，與其在主力的後方展開單縱陣，不如設法成爲前衛，以獨擅的十五吋砲打進敵人的前陣。這樣，托瑪斯隊就可從西阿戰隊（主力）切斷德國的希勃戰隊，演出將它壓迫到丹麥海岸的激戰吧。</p>
<p>在戰略上根本對比起來，日本的第二艦隊司令長官，連做夢也不會向聯合艦隊長官爭奪有力部隊的所屬。向軍令部請求增强勢力的私見，是絕對實視作不應有的觀念而被駁囘的。所以，托瑪斯戰隊倘在日本的塲合，應該是長宮（琪利科的地位）而開赴決戰塲的。又假若五日前轉屬了巡戰艦隊，則不分晝夜，留心認識第二長官（皮梯的地位）的戰法。爲了把自己成爲新長官的眞正的股肱而努力着，新長官也會想出各種方法來駕御他。</p>
<p>在旭德蘭海的第一次戰鬥中，英軍正以張冠李戴的艦隊作戰，這其間喪失兩隻大軍艦，使德軍成了名。豈不可惜！</p>
<p>（四）恐懼之至的展開</p>
<p>其次，是有名的「艦隊展開。在決定旭德蘭海戰勝敗的幾個原因中，共最大的，是下午六時前後、王力戰艦隊的戰鬥展開；這是將四隻編爲一隊的六列縱隊展開爲二十四隻的單縱隊的時間和不法的問題。</p>
<p>關於這一點，在解說戰鬥經過時，已相當詳細地說過了，這裏不再重述。只是將它槪括爲下面三項，以作批判的基礎：</p>
<p>（一）下午五點五十五分在右舷展開，這是至善的戰法。</p>
<p>（二）六點十五分的展開，也應在右舷（南西）爲之。</p>
<p>（三）琪利科在左舷（東）展開。</p>
<p>那一天，北海北部的日落是八點十九分，所以砲戰時間雖還有兩小時以上，但這正如結果所顯示的一樣。決不是充分的時問。爲了『決戰」，是應該早點開始砲戰的。因此，琪利科可以比實際上提早二十分鐘展開。爲什麼呢？因爲托瑪斯戰隊，於五點五十五分，在一八〇〇〇碼的地方，發見德軍主力，報告琪利科，皮梯的報告，將這報爲希勃戰隊，缺乏了一致；不過敵人的所在，九成以上是正確的，早點要求決戰的提督，應在這時決行展開。對方假使是希勃的巡戰隊，也無時問不充分之理，而其後向西阿戰隊施行戰鬥轉針，一點也不遲。</p>
<p>然而琪利科，於五點五十五分，六點，六點零五分，向各方面詢，問着：「敵人的戰艦在那裏？」一面南下，始終想絲毫不錯地把握着西阿戰隊的地位。這與共說是慾望，實在是爲了準備。在其所著的「大艦隊論」中不打自招的漏出了這一點意思：他說：</p>
<p>「德國主力艦隊，在其前衛集結有力的水雷戰隊，窺探我們的艦隊的展開，那時，有發生一個極大的雷擊戰的危險，所以當展開之時，我痛切地感覺到有先加以警戒的必要。</p>
<p>所以，琪利科遇到恐懼之至的敵人，而且在實行展開方向的一瞬間以前，連對各司令官也是保守秘密的。換句話說：在他的心中，與其謂爲自己想擊的敵人的戰艦隊，毋寗謂爲只有要擊自己的敵人的水雷戰隊佔領着。</p>
<p>（五）擊滅與防禦的思想混亂</p>
<p>關於此事，還有一項是應該說明的。琪利科非常恐懼德國的水雷戰隊，這祇要看他在一九一四年十月三十日向海軍部陳述的戰略基本條項中，將這點大筆特書着，就很明白了。他說：</p>
<p>「艦隊的運動難道一步不錯麽？但在我們的大艦隊未開砲門以前，難保沒有爲敵人的水中攻擊所葬送的一半可能性。所以我常將這種攻擊放在心上，深信絕對有考慮防遏敵人水雷戰成功的戰術的必要」。</p>
<p>這意見書是十二項的一封長函，但立刻從海軍部領到『全部承認』的公文，琪利科以此爲護符，實施「安全第一主義的戰法」；所以旭德蘭海戰的戰門展開，如果說是「基於避免德國水雷戰隊攻擊的方針而施行的」，那末可以大發脾氣將海軍部的大門潛藏起來。我們的結論是：當時的海長邱吉爾君應負一大半的責任。</p>
<p>琪利科在其著作中，又承認德國的水雷戰隊是世界最優秀的，對於那八十八隻的驅逐艦，從戰前就懷着恐懼。但在旭德蘭所出現的德國驅逐艦，是六十一隻，而直屬於於西阿戰隊的，只有三十一隻，是列在主力的不作戰方面的。琪利科所担憂的形狀，全然沒有發現。換言之：他的最大限度的杞憂，居然自行使決戰態勢的確立遲延了。</p>
<p>然而上述（一）所舉示的（五點五十五分的右舷展開），是日本的司令長官要斷然實行的展開。這樣一來，主力戰隊以最右翼的馬爾勃洛隊（白納中將）爲前部，航路指向二二四度，其前方爲皮梯隊，先鋒爲托瑪斯戰隊，可以得到理想的位置（後者二隊可以實行二直角轉囘）；於是從左側包圍德軍用三十三隻巨艦佈置單縱陳的態勢就成功了。於是至遲在六點零五分，英軍的巨砲可開砲火了。</p>
<p>不但如此，這五點五十五分的右舷展開，對於德國主力，是用了「事出意外」「禍起蕭牆」等形容詞也未能盡意的一種心驚胆裂的大奇襲。從背後，似乎有大鱷魚出現了。何以故呢？因爲德國的西阿提督，相信英軍主力在北北束（鮑奇加少將誤認英國的巡戰艦隊伊維西勃爾號以下爲琪利科主力的結果），他正在計算在那方向出現時候，應用怎樣的戰法；所以英軍若由右舷展開而出現於西西北，那末德軍一時只好袖手傍觀，任其奇襲了。何况西阿提督將英軍出現的時間估遲了三十分鐘，所以無論時問，無論地點，英軍是十是地可以先發制人的（蕭：譯自五月號中央公論）</p>

<p>關於急賑華北災民一事，木報速日爲文呼籲，意猶未盡，再申所見如次：</p>
<p>（一）前天在陳丁兩長官茶會中，本報記者曾即席提議組織上海市急賑華北機構，統一辦理賑濟事宜，俾事權集中，克收迅赴事功之效。當時丁部長亦認爲必要，允即籌組發表。趙秘書長並主張愼重人選，我們旣盼望及早成立，更贊同趙秘書長的主張，其基幹人選，以素孚人望的社會公正人士爲主，而政府機關，居於策進督導地位，然後各方進行步驟一致，用力不致落空。</p>
<p>（二）「救災如救火」，本報曾主張自籌慕賑款以至實地發放，第一次假定以一個月爲期，丁部長爲顧及事實，期以兩個月，但光陰如駛，即兩個月亦轉瞬即屆，我們更盼望從速成立統一機構，推動一切急賑工作。</p>
<p>（三）昨天楊撫生先生來函，願以一萬元購致袁履登先生「變物賑災」的雪茄，並建議用競賣方式，以一萬元爲最低價，全數充作捐款，而楊先生旣不吸烟，又不欲獨享，並已於前天送由本報代收捐款聯銀券一千元，這種互助同情的熱忱，令人感佩不止。盼望有力的讀者，參加競賣，「旣於災鴻有益，復成袁老之美，」並副楊先生的熱心。</p>
<p>（四）展開以慈善捐款爲目的之各種運動，如足球義賽，戲劇電影義演等等，盼望參加其事者，均盡義務，更竭力减少必要的事務費，並聘請名會計師徐永祚，李文杰，王海帆諸先生等，義務担任審核帳目。務期捐款涓滴歸公，充實基金。</p>

<p>我國以農立國，農村爲國民經濟之基礎，其盛衰興替，攸關國運者至鉅。年來農村枯竭，民生尩瘁，每况愈下，考其原因，雖有數端，而農村對都市貿易之逆勢，遂使資金偏集都市，農村周轉維艱，實爲重大之癥結，時賢已多置論，無庸贅陳。近頃金融業洞鑒時弊，量力赴援，責職所在，義不容辭，故最近辦理農業放款者，計有中國·交通·江蘇·復興等銀行。各行所辦農業貸款手續繁瑣，利息低微，固爲特殊之困難，惟以農民頗重信用，倒欠壞賬，尙不多見，故投資農村，實爲我銀行界過剩資金良好之出路。目前各行，如能合作辦理農業貸軟，其優點如下：</p>
<p>（一）農村崩潰，日甚一日，長此以往，僅此虛僞之都市繁榮，亦將因基礎崩毀趨於沒落，覆巢之下，寗有完卵？及時拯救，自屬銀行界探木窮源之舉。</p>
<p>（二）農業貸款手續，固較繁複，而據經騐所示，農民頗講信用，壞賬尙不多見，自不失爲銀行界良好投資途徑。</p>
<p>（三）已往上海各同業辦理農業貸款者，頗有成效，雖明知爲本重利輕，仍能努力前進，頗得社會之好評，各行似宜急着先鞭，藉可博得社會公衆之好感。</p>
<p>（四）農業貸款，必須深入內地，接近農民，各行業務，亦可因之遠播各地，深入民問，無形中爲金融業增加一種雄厚之資產。</p>

<p>主任委員孫仲立報吿詞，略謂：本委員會是全國商統會內部機構之一，在各專業委員會中，最先着手組織，一切都無例可循，今天幸吿成立，都是中日兩國當局以深切的理解和信任，給予同業以自治的機會，並應歸功於糧部和商統會雙方的指導。本人力量薄弱，對於工作推進，眞有「時凜氷淵」的戒心。但當勉力去做，倘有成績，當感謝中日兩國當局所賜予的種種援助，及同業諸公熱忱的協力。萬一中途遭遇困難，不能達到理想目的，自當請兩國政府當局，切實指示解決辦法，這是本人迫切的希望。</p>

<p>顧部長訓詞略謂：自前月我國府接受友邦好意，交還物質管理權，乃有商統總會之組織，而以各業同業公會及其聯合會爲其下層機構，復爲求執行之便利起見，對於粉麥，乃有此粉麥委員會之組織，在短短時期內，竟得圓滿成立，殊堪欽佩。糧部主管之各主要糧食物資之區，同業公會及各地區聯合會，均已先後成立，今後各該業即應由商統會開始指導其業務之進行，作具體之運營。至於粉麥專委會之成立，本人亟盼能發揮力量，以爲其他各業之模範，更願本委會以專門謀同行之利益爲宗旨，即此外對於農民及消費者之福利，同業之經營上合理化，成本費用之减低等，均應爲其目標云。</p>

<p>— 嚴燕初</p>
<p>蜜蜂，他是動物中最勤懇的一種，每到春夏之交，它便展開了天賦的變翅，往來交織於田野之間，採尋蜜汁，爲了生存而搏鬥，用着自己的力量去求得自己生命的延續，這是最合邏輯的生存方式，也是蜜蜂所具的特點。</p>
<p>敎師，小職員……等薪水階級的人，他們終日運用他們天賦的身體，和腦力，去換得各種必需物質。用着最高尙純潔的方法去求得生存，與蜜蜂具有同樣的特點。因此我說敎師，小職員們像蜜蜂。</p>
<p>狐狸的狡滑，是婦孺皆知的，一提起了狐狸就使人起一種討厭的心理。一方面固然是牠外表的不雅，而最大的原因却是它大審投機取巧了，他往往擱起了自己的四肢不用，而專思利誘他物所獵取的東西，他的生存的方式有些像人類中投機囤積的一羣，他們運用陰險惡毒的手腕，去掠奪別人勞動的結果，而爲人們所不齒。</p>
<p>蜜蜂與狐狸同是動物；敎師，小職員與囤積諸公同是人類，爲了生存方式的不同，一提起蜜蜂敎師與小職員，便會使人敬慕，愛憐；一談到狐狸與囤積公，就會使人唾棄，這也許是人類愛與憎的分野吧！</p>
<h3 id="c46">上海劇壇的明暗面 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 小窗</p>
<p>這該從大東亞戰事爆發後說起罷，有悠久歷史的上海劇藝社及擁有很多優秀演員的上海職業劇團先後宣告解散，這時存在的祇有一個中旅劇團是有歷史的，上演些新的引不起人注意的劇本，及一部份人所組織以影星爲號召的劇團，上演些曹禺的幾個劇本外，其餘是很少有動靜，但隔了未久，即產生了由前劇藝社，上職一部份人等組織的榮偉公司，上演了巴金原著的「春」「秋」及曹禺的「鍍金」等幾個戲，沉寂了一時的劇壇，似乎又復活起來，可是不久又吿解散而分裂的了。</p>
<p>繼之而起的，有姚克編導的「楚覇王」在蘭心上演，成績未能如人意。同時，又產生了費穆主持的上海藝術劇團，作長時期的演出，第一個戲是由費穆編導的「楊貴妃」，並且嘗試了以音樂加强演出的氣氛，結果有很好的收獲，這樣上藝就決定了以後每個戲都有樂隊的節奏。第二個戲是袁牧之改編的「鐘樓怪人」，由馬徐維邦，費穆聯合導演，此劇寫上層社會的醜惡，下層份子質樸，愚莽，魯鈍的可愛，及一片爭取自由的呼聲，導演創獨特新的風格，給觀衆不可磨減的印象。繼續的有「荒島英雄」和「第二夢」的演出，這都是由巴雷原著編譯的劇本，劇情含畜很深，對人生諷刺很激烈，並有極深刻暗示着人生的錯誤，這二戲先後的演出，無疑對觀衆也有很好的印象，以後又有「搖錢樹」，「四　妹」等的演出，成績都也還不錯，這時期的上藝是很努力的，也許不能賣座的原因？在卡爾登輟演了。接着演出的是華藝劇團的「人間世」，是胡梯維編劇的，又上演了「梁山伯祝英台」「人生大事」等劇，除「人生大事」差强人意外，未能有較好的成績。接着上藝擴充內部，加入了一批苦幹的人員，上演了師陀編劇的「大馬戲團」由石揮，英子，等演出，賣座也不弱，及李之華編的「男女之間」的上演，都能在水準以上，接着就上演了「秋海棠」，大量的人力，物力耗盡在這個戲上，能迎合小市民層低級興趣的緣故，賣座奇盛，是劇壇未有的奇蹟，可是難獲得愛好藝術觀衆的贊同。</p>
<p>藝光劇團的產生，上演了李健吾編劇的「雲彩霞」及「甜姐兒」「晚宴」「春閨風月」等的西洋劇本，方君逸編的「秦淮月」，黃宗江編劇的「大地」，都能够得上水準，允其是「晚宴」一劇，是世界名劇，由石華父改編的，導演洪謨手法運用也很新頴，演員有藍蘭，黃宗江，胡導，蔣天流等，演技也不弱，然而賣不起座，這該是劇壇的苦衷。</p>
<p>新戲院麗華大戲院的開幕，由中旅的一部份演員組織，中中劇團演出，上演了些周貽白編的「春江花月」夏霞編導的「寡婦院」羅明編的「魯男子」及其他「小婦人」「孤星淚」「傾國傾城」等一類的戲，都以個人爲號召，雖擁有大量的觀衆，成績也不見得好，最近是輟演了。</p>
<p>金都改爲話劇院，成立了上聯劇團，經常地在金都演出，第一個劇目是「花信風」，李健吾編劇，吳仞之導演的，第二個是陳白塵編劇的「結婚進行曲」演出，作家利用了現實的題材，盡量的暴露社會的醜態，暗示着靑年的切身問題，結婚問題是怎樣才獲解決？導演章杰處理也很簡潔，演員有的稍差外，有很努力的演出，這是最近難獲得到的一個戲，「一綫天」題材也很純正，可是賣不起座，這緣故吧？繼續把張恨水小說「滿江紅」搬上舞臺，也同樣的用全體導演聯合編導，全體演員合演爲號召，雖有他們的苦衷，水準的低落是不容否認的。</p>
<p>這些是近年來劇壇的輪廊，吿訴我們是在量的方面，一個話劇院有一個劇團的演出，演劇的塲所在增多，演出的劇團也在增加，當然觀衆也在增多了，量方面是算很充足了，看來劇壇是相當的熱閙。質的方面，劇人有的到外埠去演戲，有的不幹戲劇了，雖然有新的人才的產生，可是劇團增多，都感到難以應付，產生這劇團的導演，又是那劇團的導演，這劇團的演員，又是那劇團的演員，劇作家同樣的爲這劇團寫劇，又爲那劇團寫劇等的現象。各劇團爲了營業上競爭，就注意某演員擁有很多愛好他演技的觀衆，就重金去請他來主演戲，有的爲了使劇團演員不去加入另一劇團，抬高酬報，就加厚些所謂台柱演員的薪給，一些無地位的演員薪金仍菲薄得可憐，一方面戲院爲增加利潤，維持開支的口號下，座價無限制的在提高，一部份愛好藝術的觀衆被排擠在門外，無法踏進門去，爲了賣座的低落，就動腦每個戲對觀衆是否有噱頭，劇情是不注意了，全體編導，全體合演，編的戲題材，也不計較是否有意義，並且說得頭頭有道的，暴露黑暗啊，指示光明啊，戀愛眞諦啊，反封建啊，一大串動聽的話，都脫離了戲劇的木義，幹戲劇爲了推進劇運，可是已被作爲賺錢的目標，雖然演員生活也需維持，但不應有過份的享受，這些都是劇壇的黑暗面。另一方面的，也有一部份幹戲劇的人始終站在本位上工作是很努力的，他們有時忍受着肚餓及一切的困難在繼續幹下去，爲了顧全了劇團的生命，忍住了淚的走向不願意走的方向走去，願這些有爲的藝人，別再流連在賣座的念頭上，幹戲劇爲了吃飯，可是也別忘了幹戲劇工作的木義——爲推進劇運而努力。</p>

<p>— 大下宇陀兒</p>
<p>（一）奇蹟的圍巾</p>
<p>開戰那天歷史的日子，珍珠灣被濃厚的　　　蔽了她的眞面目。</p>
<p>「啊！在那裏！』我海軍機在沒有發見之前，眞是萬分焦燥而擔憂。　　　層並沒有把整個世界全部封閉，在她的罅隙中，那軍港被發見了。</p>
<p>可是，據說我航空部隊起初幾乎一度錯過了這最要緊的　縫。</p>
<p>那時候，搭乘某機的一勇士，頸上圍着圍巾。那是這勇士的妹子，想乘了飛機在幾千公尺高度以上時的寒冷，故而在出擊以前，特意製贈的圍巾。當飛機在珍珠灣上空探覓的時候，視綫被濃厚的雲層遮蔽了。不能發見所欲探覓的軍港。那時候地上的風速是十七公尺。眞在想着即將有暴風襲來吧！果然，那勇士頸上的圍巾，倐地被風吹落了。唉！眞可惜！勇士囘頭斜向後方在半空中看那國巾落下的去向，於是在那邊看見有一片　縫。一霎眼那雲縫即飛臨面前。恰似在夢中一樣，發見了珠珍灣一塊大地。敵艦的幢幢黑影，散佈在那裏，歷歷可數。</p>
<p>勇士歡喜得大叫起來。</p>
<p>於是我大隊海軍機突破雲層，飛臨那軍港的上空，加以空前壯烈的猛轟，獲得了永遠値得紀念的大戰果。</p>
<p>（二）艱辛的忍耐</p>
<p>大家知道最先發見「威爾斯親王號」與「雷相　號」的　　水艦。關於那發見，或許也有甚麽奇　，不過目前還未聽見有何傳說。</p>
<p>但這潛水艦的忍耐，却是値得一提的。</p>
<p>『等候了長久的時期，即將到來了。貪得無饜的英美那時祇要見到就可加以轟擊了。」某軍曹—在昭和十六年秋在華南方面乘海軍機自炸—在休假歸來的時候這樣說。重慶他已去過二十次以上。他所引爲遺憾的一是，重慶雖已遍地彈痕累累，可是英美人所居住的一區，一次也未被轟炸，安然無事。到那邊去。心裏總想即使能擲下一枚炸彈也好，以洩胸中一股恨毒，但事實上却不許有一彈在那區域落下，所以他在說話的時候盈盈欲涕。不久終於與英美空戰了，祇要見到英美人，英美的束西，英美的一切，隨時隨地都可以轟炸了。可惜他在此以前已逝世了。在馬來海面的潛水艦，他們相信自己所發出的第一彈，無足以制敵的死命。他們在缺乏接濟，彈盡糧絕的環境下，仍毅然潛入水中。他們的腦海中祇有刺探敵艦下落的接觸任務，而把他們的發見傳達於航空部隊。</p>
<p>這忍耐是可尊的。功名可以讀給他人，他們祇求完成目的不問其他。（異：譯自四部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Mission to Defend the Pacific: The Nation Should Urgently Catch Up and Enhance Naval Knowledge <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Pacific is the Pacific of Asians, and it must be defended by Asians themselves. Historically, the severe threats to the Pacific have been resolved by the arduous battles of the Japanese Navy. The first time was the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago (1904-1905), and the second time is the ongoing Greater East Asia War. In the first war, Tsarist Russia attempted to provoke a foreign war to eliminate its domestic revolutionary forces, maintain its autocratic rule, and further defeat Japan to annex Manchuria and North China, competing with other powers to divide China. Fortunately, after the Meiji Restoration, Japan made rapid progress in national strength, its morale was high, and especially its new naval power was cultivated. In the battles outside Lushun Port and the Sea of Japan, it defeated the world-renowned Tsarist Russian fleet that had been sent to East Asia, laying the foundation for Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War. The prestige of our navy has since spread to the world's seven oceans. This is the most glorious history of the Pacific nations' navies. The second time, in the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy, at the beginning of the war on December 8, 1941, destroyed the American naval outpost of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, which dominated the Pacific, and then there were continuous victories in Hong Kong, Malaya, Manila, Singapore, and Java, causing the British and American navies, which had always held an absolutely superior position in the world's navies, to suffer fatal blows and annihilation. From then on, they were willing to retreat and seek to survive, but to no avail. This undertaking of the Japanese Navy will clearly occupy the most important position in future world history. However, we must recognize that the enemy's forces have not been completely eliminated or thoroughly annihilated. To maintain the victories already won and to consolidate the defenses in the Pacific, so that the enemy will never dare to cross the Pacific, not only requires greater efforts from the Japanese Navy, but also requires all East Asian countries to build up their naval power and, under the leadership of the Japanese Navy, to assume their respective inherent responsibilities. Here, China naturally has an extremely important position.</p>
<p>China is a continental country, and has always been known for its vast number of army soldiers. However, in terms of geographical and strategic situation, China is also a maritime country. Our eastern, southeastern, southern, and southwestern borders, from the Bohai Bay around the Shandong Peninsula, through the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, along the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, through the South China Sea to the Tokyo Bay, the length of the coastline is the first among East Asian countries. Along this coastline, from Shanghai downwards, are all our first-class modern metropolises. Moreover, along the waterways of the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, there are major cities all over the coast, which are the essence of the whole country. Therefore, China either does not talk about national defense, or if it is necessary to prepare for national defense, then, although the situation is different now and in the past, the essence of national defense is the same: to establish a true maritime defense and a strong navy. Otherwise, talking about national defense is inevitably self-deception. Especially in this Greater East Asia War, we are a participating country, but in reality, we have not mobilized most of our forces to assist Japan in the war. From the obligation of participation in the war, we cannot but feel even more ashamed. However, it is not too late to catch up quickly. The reason why we are calling on all Chinese people to make efforts in the research of naval construction lies in this.</p>
<p>In this important sense, we are starting today, for a period of ten days, excerpting records from our newspaper thirty-eight years ago about the Russo-Japanese War, and descriptions from current famous Japanese newspapers and magazines about the reasons for the Japanese Navy's victory, in order to arouse the interest of the Chinese people in the ocean and the navy, provide basic knowledge about the ocean and the navy, and promote the movement of our country's naval construction and coastal defense construction, so that in the new mission of defending the Pacific, in the near future, our country will also be able to fulfill its responsibilities.

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>We recognize that defending the Pacific from now on will be entirely the responsibility of Asians, and the intrusion and aggression of Britain and the United States will no longer be allowed. However, fulfilling the task of defense depends on a strong naval force. Our friendly nation, Japan, has built its navy through decades of hard work and continuous improvement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, it revealed its talent by defeating the many with the few. In the current Greater East Asia War, it has demonstrated its invincible power. At present, the friendly navy alone bears the difficult task of the entire Pacific defense, and we feel deeply ashamed that we have not been able to share the burden. Therefore, how we can learn from the friendly navy as a model, build a new Chinese navy, and participate in the task of defending the Pacific is a goal that the people of the country should strive to pursue together. In order to increase the Chinese people's naval knowledge and interest, this newspaper will excerpt and reprint the records from this newspaper during the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, from the 21st to the 30th, for a period of ten days. We hope that readers will pay attention.</p>
<h3 id="e3">On the Righteousness of the Japanese (Published in This Newspaper No. 11089, Guangxu 30th Year, First Month, 18th Day, Western Calendar March 4th, 1904, Friday) <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>A letter recently arrived from Tokyo, Japan, stating that since Japan went to war with Russia, it has solicited public bonds to finance military needs. Officials and dignitaries who are righteous and public-spirited are all vying to donate. It is estimated that Furukawa Junkichi donated 1 million yen to the Bank of Japan, Inoue Kaoru and Katsura Taro each donated 2 million yen, Tanaka Mitsuaki donated 25,000 yen, Hijikata Hisamoto and Watanabe Chiaki each donated 15,000 yen, Hanafusa Yoshimoto and Kagawa Keizo each donated 10,000 yen, plus the applicants from various banks: Sumitomo 5 million yen, Konoike 3 million yen, 34th 2 million yen, Yamaguchi Naniwa Osaka Savings Kitahama each 2 million yen, Japan Savings 2 million yen, Kato 700,000 yen, Omi Fujimoto each 500,000 yen, San Sho Kibara 58 each 200,000 yen, Toraya 150,000 yen, Jizendo Allied Industries Bishu Commerce Sakura each 500,000 yen, Kawakami 50,000 yen, Kawamitsu Nishi Roku Tomo Furuichi Tomioka each 20,000 yen, Katsuragi 10,000 yen. This newspaper has published this letter in the newspaper. Upon reading it, the writer could not help but sigh and say: How loyal to the country and how courageous in righteousness are the Japanese! The rise and fall of a country depends on the direction of the people's hearts. If everyone is loyal to their ruler and loves their country, then no matter what happens, they can handle it with ease. The rise of Japan is attributed by everyone to the effects of the Meiji Restoration: changing politics, reforming laws, changing clothing, establishing schools, strengthening military power, studying physics, and refining manufacturing. Initially, they learned from the West, and then they reaped its benefits. The island nation in the East Sea, which was once despised by European and American countries, can now compete with them and is respected by all. Since the victory over China in the Sino-Japanese War, its national strength has become increasingly prosperous and its military power has become increasingly strong. Chinese scholars and officials are all shocked and amazed by this, believing that China is weak because it cannot reform, and Japan is strong because it is courageous in reform. I believe that the effect of the Japanese Restoration is indeed as such. But does one know that its rise is not only due to the Restoration, but also to the fact that everyone is loyal to their ruler and loves their country? If everyone knows to be loyal to their ruler and love their country, then they will unite as one, with one heart and one mind, knowing only the ruler and not themselves; knowing only the country and not their families; forgetting themselves and their families, and they will naturally not feel brave in performing their duties, and their hearts will naturally be selfless. In this way, everything will be done with sincerity and strength, abuses can be eliminated, benefits can be promoted, and the country will prosper. It is not only in the current war with Russia that its ministers generously donate huge sums of money to help with military expenses, which is enough to show their loyalty to the ruler and love for the country. But even this one thing is enough to show the Japanese people's loyalty to the ruler and their love for the country. It is appropriate that they can confront the strong Russia, exert their courage, and destroy the enemy's forces. In the future, they will work together with one heart, and with one battle, they will dominate. The leadership of Asia may be held in the hands of the Japanese, which is also not an unpredictable thing, and it is all achieved by the Japanese people's heart of loyalty to the ruler and love for the country. Although, because of the Japanese people's loyalty to the ruler and love for the country, and thus the country's rise, I cannot help but sigh for our China. Our China is weak because everyone thinks that it does not know how to reform. The laws have indeed been changed, but if the hearts of the people of the whole country do not focus on the ruler and the country, then talking about revitalization will only lead to chaos; talking about consolidation will only lead to disintegration. How can one hope that it will turn from weak to strong? Moreover, those above are all ministers who deceive and embellish, encroach on public funds for personal gain, hoard wealth for their families, and do not know how to relieve the difficulties of the ruler and father. Those below are all commoners who are stingy and frugal, meticulous in accounting, enrich their own wealth, and do not know the meaning of contributing. Therefore, among the ministers today, there are those who have millions of wealth, and there are those who have several million; among the commoners, there are those who have tens of thousands, and there are those who have millions. But at this time of financial strain, I have never heard of anyone voluntarily contributing their meager resources to help the country. If this war were to be moved to China, I know that even if the country intended to borrow public bonds, it would definitely not be able to match the Japanese people's public-spiritedness and righteousness. Alas! Everyone does not know how to be loyal to the ruler and love the country. This is the source of our China's weakness, and not knowing how to devote themselves to implementing new policies is a later matter! I am discussing the righteousness of the Japanese, and connecting it to this. I cannot help but throw down my pen and sigh three times, feeling ashamed and sweating!</p>

<p>A letter from Hanjing, Korea, said: On February 6th of the Eastern Calendar (that is, December 21st of the Chinese Calendar last year), the Japanese captured a Russian volunteer ship, weighing 7,000 tons, and the China Eastern Railway Bureau transport ship Morokoron between Jeoryeong Island and Mok Island in Busan. At 10:12 AM that day, a Japanese warship saw a large Russian steamer circling westward from Wonsan. It quickly used binoculars to measure it, and the Japanese flag was raised high on the stern. By 11:00 AM, it sailed near the Tsushima Strait. The Japanese warship then pursued it, and when it was ten nautical miles away from the mouth of Busan, it ran alongside it. After forty minutes, it approached Baek Island. Two Japanese torpedo boats intercepted it in front. At 12:00, the Japanese warship Jiyuan ordered it to stop its engine. The Japanese warships then surrounded it on three sides, and then lowered a small boat. The officers drew their swords in their hands, and the sailors held their knives and guns. They approached the ship, jumped on board, and searched it thoroughly, finding many weapons and more than two thousand army officers and soldiers. The ship weighed more than 7,000 tons, and it was then known that it was a volunteer ship, transporting weapons from Urakawa to Lushun, fearing danger en route, and therefore posing as a Japanese flag. As for the China Eastern Railway Bureau transport ship, it usually traveled between Shanghai and Urakawa. On February 5th of the Eastern Calendar (that is, December 20th of the Chinese Calendar last year), it went from Urakawa to Busan to transport military grain to Lushun. At 5:00 PM on the 6th, it raised its flag and started its anchor, sailing out of the gate. The Japanese warships A and B and the torpedo ships C, D, E, and F blocked its path forward, surrounding it on all sides. The Fuso and Tsukushi ships aimed their cannons at it from a distance, ordering it to stop its engine. The ship then did not move forward. The Japanese warships then lowered several small boats, and the officers and sailors rushed aboard, bringing the ship back and ordering all the sailors on the deck to enter the cabin and search them one by one, seeing that they were all the materials needed by the army. They were then escorted back, and at 7:00 PM, they arrived in Sasebo.</p>

<p>National Government Instruction</p>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) The government held the fifteenth Supreme National Defense Council meeting on the 20th and resolved to abolish the original Clean-Up Committee, which could not adapt to the current situation, and transfer all clean-up affairs to the Executive Yuan for unified approval and handling. At the same time, it was abolished on the 20th in the form of a National Government instruction, and it was limited to be completed and transferred within this month. The clean-up work mechanism has seen the centralization of administration, and clean-up affairs will be further expanded. The original National Government instruction is recorded as follows: Since the beginning of the clean-up campaign, the National Government has specially established a Clean-Up Committee to preside over it, due to the fact that the matter is a pioneering undertaking, with the dedication of officers and officials and the understanding and support of the people. In the past two years, it has been effective day by day. With the strong assistance of friendly Japan, it has been able to eliminate bandits and consolidate security. The profound friendship and enthusiasm are deeply engraved. In the initial stage, the clean-up area was only ten counties in Jiangsu. After the second phase, it gradually expanded, followed by Shanghai and Zhejiang, then followed by northern Jiangsu and Anhui, and Hubei and Guangdong are also in preparation. The area is becoming increasingly larger, and the affairs are becoming increasingly complex. The original Clean-Up Committee is not sufficient to adapt, and it should be terminated within this month, and all clean-up affairs should be transferred to the Executive Yuan for unified leadership and handling, in order to achieve the effect of overall planning and consideration. The clean-up affairs of Jiangsu, Hubei, Anhui, Hebei, and Guangdong provinces, and Shanghai Special City, are all the responsibility of the respective provincial and municipal governments, and they should earnestly handle them by following the orders of the Executive Yuan. Military affairs should still maintain close contact with the friendly army, and the system should be clear and the action should be swift, so as to complete the task of ensuring security and increasing production in the shortest possible time, so that this work can be carried out in cooperation to complete the Greater East Asia War. There is great hope for this. This order.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) The announcement by the French government that it would return the Guangdong, Tianjin, and Hankou concessions in China and the signing of detailed clauses and understandings shocked Chongqing. According to reliable sources, Foreign Minister Song Ziwen of Chongqing lodged a strong protest with France over this matter, saying that the French government's move was inappropriate. However, the French government has made no response to this, which shows that Chongqing's so-called protest is merely to confuse the public in the war zone.</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Central News Agency) The French government's abandonment of rights in China has been confirmed by a statement issued by the French Foreign Ministry last night. The content is as follows: Based on its desire to enhance friendly relations with China, France issued a public declaration on February 23, 1943, deciding to abandon the rights of the French Concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Regarding this matter, China and France signed a treaty on May 17, which will be implemented on June 5, 1943.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) Regarding the return of concessions in China by France, the Japanese Consul General in Guangzhou recently issued the following statement: The French Concessions in Shamian, Guangzhou, and Tianjin and Hankou were simultaneously decided on the 18th to be returned by France to the Republic of China, and representatives of the two countries have completed the signing of detailed clauses in Nanjing. France's voluntary return of concessions in China during the Greater East Asia War is of profound significance. Under this wartime system, China and Japan are advancing towards the destruction of Britain and the United States in the spirit of living and dying together. The complete independence of China and the strengthening of national power have also been our country's long-cherished wish for many years. At this time, France's move to return concessions in China is a result of a genuine understanding of the position of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and its future. We express our full respect for this measure. In the future, the friendly relations between China, Japan, and France will be even more profound, and they will make a great contribution to the construction of a new world order.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After the Japanese army's elite units completed the suppression of the Communist 18th Group Army in the northern Taihang Mountains, around their strongholds of Junji Pass and Songyan Town, they suddenly turned northwest on the 18th, sweeping away the remnants of the Communist army everywhere, steadily expanding their victories.

One unit has attacked Jingjiacun (30 kilometers northwest of Heshun), another unit has attacked Yangzhengcun (30 kilometers southwest of Heshun), another unit has attacked Xigou (25 kilometers southwest of Heshun), one unit has attacked Changchengnan (35 kilometers southwest of Heshun), and one unit has attacked Neiyanglin (22 kilometers southwest of Heshun). In addition, the Japanese army units and the Chinese anti-communist forces have also cut off the Communist army's retreat to the south, advancing westward to the Yushe area. It is reported that a certain Japanese army unit launched a night attack on the Communist army in Shuangfeng Town (50 kilometers southwest of Heyu) on the 18th, inflicting an annihilating blow.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Yu Xuezhong, Commander of the Chongqing-Lu-Su War Zone, is making efforts to reorganize the remnants of the 14th Division and the Chongqing "Shandong Provincial Government Army" and a portion of Li Xianzhou's "32nd Army" recently moving north, totaling more than 20,000 men, and is preparing to reorganize them. After the Japanese army detected this encirclement, they are currently launching an annihilation campaign. The Japanese army units and the Shandong Army of the National Government, under General Wu Huawen, are working closely together to tightly encircle the Chongqing army strongholds in Puli Village, Dashi Gou, Zhao Jia Zhuang, and other places 40 kilometers west of Yishui in central Shandong, and are gradually tightening the encirclement. On the 17th, they captured the strong Chongqing army positions of Pangzhixie, Ban Gu, Da Gu, Di, etc., and completely annihilated the Chongqing army attempting to break out of the encirclement. As of the 19th, it had been confirmed that there were 2,300 Chongqing army corpses left behind, and 2,760 people were captured. The Japanese army captured 2 anti-aircraft guns, 2 heavy machine guns, 72 light machine guns, 1,700 rifles, and a large quantity of other communication equipment, ammunition, and military supplies.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The provinces of North China have suffered from successive years of floods and last year's locust plagues and drought, resulting in poor harvests and widespread suffering. During this time of scarcity before the new harvest, food shortages have become increasingly severe. Chairman Wang has received repeated reports from North China and is extremely concerned. Some time ago, President Chen Gongbo and Vice President Zhou Fo Hai were sent as envoys to Japan and Manchuria, and they witnessed the disaster situation when they passed through North China, and were deeply shocked. After reporting back to Nanjing, Chairman Wang became even more anxious and instructed all relevant parties to find ways to provide relief. Through the joint efforts of the Ministries of Finance and Food and the assistance of friendly nations, a large sum of money has been allocated and food has been mobilized. At the same time, Wang Yintai, the Superintendent of the North China Industrial Bureau, sent Section Chief Zhang Lingqing south to seek instructions and oversee the purchase of food, assisted by personnel from the Ministry of Food. It is reported that various types of food have been purchased, including more than 105,000 bags of flour, more than 1,000 shi of wheat, and more than 1,500 shi of soybeans. In addition, the Ministry of Food has allocated 2,000 shi of broken rice from its inventory. It is understood that the Ministry of Food will continue to purchase and transport food to the north, so the serious food problem in North China can be slightly alleviated.</p>

<p>Istanbul, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After the end of the Tunisian campaign, the direction of the Turkish government has become the focus of attention for all countries in the world. The Turkish government and people also feel deeply that they are one step closer to the flames of war, and are closely watching the evolution of the international political situation, and are paying the greatest attention to the determination of the anti-Axis military strategy at the Washington-Loj Conference. What Turkey hopes for now is that the United Kingdom and the United States will postpone the opening of the second front and first devote all their efforts to the Pacific front. In his speech in Istanbul on the 14th, Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu reiterated Turkey's policy of adhering to neutrality, so the primary goal of Turkey now is to avoid being drawn into the war. Since the Adana Conference, the anti-Axis countries' policy of appeasement towards Turkey has become increasingly blatant, but it has not achieved any results. Therefore, from this point of view, it can also be understood that Turkey is making efforts to avoid being drawn into the war. If the decisive battle between the Axis and anti-Axis can be launched outside of the Eastern Mediterranean or the Balkan Peninsula, it will be beneficial to the psychology of the Turkish people, because what the Turkish people hope for is a peaceful life and do not want to be involved in the war. Their greatest concern is only to defend their country against foreign enemies.</p>
<p>Ankara, 20th (German News Agency) - Political and diplomatic figures in Ankara are paying close attention to the calm attitude maintained by Turkish officials towards the end of the North African campaign and the Loj Conference. Last winter, Ankara often believed that after the North African campaign, it would be followed by an invasion of Europe, and was particularly concerned about the location of the attack, especially the Balkans. Turkish officials have also repeatedly expressed publicly that they hope that the military activities of the anti-Axis countries will be as far away as possible from Turkey's sphere of interest, including the Aegean Sea. However, Turkish officials all believe that the United States will shift its main battlefield to the Pacific for military and domestic political reasons. According to Turkish Congressman Esmir, who is close to the US Ambassador to Turkey, in an article published in the semi-official Ulus newspaper, the activities of the United States may be limited to participating in the air war against the European Axis powers in conjunction with the United Kingdom and providing material assistance to the Soviet Union. Regarding the internal politics of the United States and the upcoming presidential election, Turkish observers believe that Roosevelt must show American voters who vote better results than the military expeditions in Africa and the Near East. Regarding this point, these observers strongly argued that disagreements within the anti-Axis camp are increasing, because Stalin has publicly stated that he intends to act independently in the conduct of the war, and the United States' attempts to contain the Soviet-Polish conflict have also failed. Therefore, Roosevelt may also direct the war according to his own wishes. In this case, the main force of the US military will be transferred to the Pacific, and in the Mediterranean Sea, which is of most concern to the Turks, only the United Kingdom will deal with the Axis powers alone. Regarding the British and American propaganda in the Balkans, the Turkish side also deals with it from a realistic point of view.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Churchill Admits that the Strength of the Axis Powers is Immense, Delivers a Speech at a Joint Session of the US Congress, Hopes that a Four-Power Summit Can be Realized Soon <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Argentina, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Washington dispatch, British Prime Minister Churchill delivered his views on the world war situation at a joint session of the US Senate and House of Representatives on the 19th. He said, since I decided to attend your Congress and deliver a speech, it has been 17 months. At that time, the people of your country were in an uproar because of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the declarations of war against the United States by Germany and Italy. Since then, we have fought shoulder to shoulder against the powerful Axis forces. Excellent British and American people are united with each other because of common crises, solemn beliefs, and lofty ideals. I firmly believe that the close unity of the United Kingdom and the United States in peacetime or wartime is more important than any other issue. The anti-Axis forces have suffered repeated defeats in the Pacific War, especially the battles of the Malay Peninsula and Singapore, which were unprecedented defeats in British history. My visit to your country this time with Field Marshal Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Expeditionary Force, and other military leaders is by no means to crush the Japanese victory. The British people are actually more concerned about continuing to fight the Japanese army than the people of your country. At present, the war against Japan is concentrated on the eastern border of India, and the United Kingdom has to deal with it with the army, navy, and air force. It is also the most important common task of the anti-Axis countries to provide effective assistance to the Chongqing regime as soon as possible. When the time is ripe, the United Kingdom will use all its strength to fight the Japanese army. If the British army in India has completed all preparations for the invasion of Burma, then I can order the attack this afternoon, but the reality is not that simple. Although we must now fight in both Europe and East Asia, the European war is actually important. I said this not meaning that we cannot launch offensives on both sides at the same time. In 1942, although the United States deployed the main force of the US military on the Pacific front to fight against Japan, the British army shouldered the heavy responsibility on the Atlantic front, and the merchant ships lost by the United Kingdom in the Atlantic were several times the number lost by the United States in the Pacific after its entry into the war. Recently, we have made considerable progress in dealing with submarine tactics. Although the situation in the submarine war has improved slightly, the threat of Axis submarines is still the greatest crisis that the United Kingdom and the United States cannot avoid at present. The British Air Force has recently launched an offensive against the European continent with the strong assistance of the US Air Force, but it is still controversial whether it can win after obtaining air supremacy, but I think this move is worth a try. We must also face the Japanese army with air power as soon as possible. The United Kingdom and the United States have reached an agreement on this point. Regarding the use of the army, I think we should discuss it carefully to ensure its perfection due to the activity of Axis submarines and other major difficulties. The Soviet Union will still face major threats this year, and the United Kingdom and the United States should work hard to reduce the threats faced by the Soviet Union. President Roosevelt and I both hope to hold a meeting with Chairman Stalin and Chairman Chiang as soon as possible. But at present, the Axis forces still have a huge army and abundant resources, and ensure various strategic locations. If the war is prolonged, how complex events will occur, and the democratic countries may fall into division after being exhausted. Therefore, the prolongation of the war is a major crisis for the anti-Axis countries.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to the Swedish correspondent in London, Churchill's speech to the US Congress on the Pacific War was aimed at arousing the US to focus on the war against Japan, while Britain and the Soviet Union were responsible for dealing with Germany. There was much discussion in London about Churchill's speech. The correspondent also said that Churchill's statement that Britain would assist the United States in concert against Japan when the time was ripe was aimed at the Americans. Churchill did not mention General Teague, nor did he add a word to the rumors spread by British and American newspapers that Italy would be eliminated by political pressure, which was regrettable.</p>

<h3 id="e23">The Disparity in Japanese and British Tactical Thought (1) <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Itō Masanori</p>
<p>(1) The Tactics of Two Admirals</p>
<p>During the First European War, both British Admirals Jellicoe and Beatty, who participated in the Battle of Jutland, embraced British-style individualism, treating the British Navy as their own personal fleet. We should critique this matter from both strategic and tactical perspectives. Representing the former is the competition over the Thomas Squadron.</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Thomas's 5th Battle Squadron consisted of four of the newest battleships: the Barham, the Osbert, the Malaya, and the Valiant (27,500 tons, eight 15-inch guns, 25 knots). It was known to be the strongest squadron in the world at the time. Five days before the outbreak of the Battle of Jutland (May 26, 1916), this squadron was an effective wing—a decisive wing—of Jellicoe's main fleet and was highly valued. Jellicoe, like Marshal Tōgō during the Battle of Tsushima who relied on the Nisshin and Kasuga, placed his faith (two of the six main ships, with armored cruisers acting as battleships) in these four newest battleships. Jellicoe then possessed twenty-eight battleships, of which ten had 12-inch guns, eleven at the center had 13.5-inch guns (the other two had 15-inch guns, and one had 14-inch guns); however, Thomas's four battleships, all equipped with 15-inch guns and boasting a speed of 25 knots, were the most important capital ships. Why were they assigned to Beatty? The details are quite interesting.</p>
<p>(2) Jellicoe's Failed Competition</p>
<p>After the start of the European War, these elite battleships were organized (Queen Elizabeth class); however, before this, a problem had already arisen: should these fast battleships belong to Jellicoe's main force or Beatty's battlecruiser squadron? The former argued that, based on the ship type (battleship), they should naturally be the central force of the main battleship fleet; conversely, the latter pointed out that the squadron's speed was naturally designed for cooperation with the battlecruiser fleet. Neither side would yield, and the Admiralty and Naval General Staff found themselves in a difficult position, but in the end, they decided to keep the ships under Jellicoe's command as before. However, the competitive Beatty was never willing to give up and, whenever he had the opportunity, advocated for the transfer of the Thomas Squadron, his words even containing a rather激烈的tone.</p>
<p>But on May 12, at a major meeting held in Rosyth focusing on the naval base issue, the First Lord of the Admiralty Balfour, Jellicoe, and Beatty met. At the meeting, Beatty demanded from the First Lord and commander that the transfer be implemented, and a heated discussion broke out between the two admirals, leading to a scene where Balfour was sweating profusely to mediate. In the end, a compromise was reached: Jellicoe was ordered to frequently return the 5th Battle Squadron to Rosyth (Beatty's squadron's base) to participate in joint training; conversely, the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron (Rear Admiral Evan-Thomas's Invincible and the following three ships) would return to Scapa Flow (Jellicoe's main base) to participate in training at any time.</p>
<p>This was a British-style compromise. The worst aspect of this compromise was exposed on the battlefield of the Battle of Jutland. In other words, the Thomas Squadron sailed into Rosyth Naval Port on May 26, and without having the time for formal joint training, it was faced with the great naval battle of the 31st. Therefore, there was no coordination between Beatty's squadron and Thomas's squadron. Although the Thomas Squadron was Admiral Beatty's most powerful arm, unfortunately, it was not his own arm but someone else's. There was no action at the moment when the signal came from his nerve center, and there were often delays. As a result, the British forces missed two good opportunities, and Beatty's squadron suffered a defeat with two large warships being sunk. Now, let's briefly prove this fact from a tactical perspective.</p>
<p>(3) The Cause and Effect of Internal Discord</p>
<p>At 2:32 PM, the signal "Heading South-Southeast" that Beatty sent to Thomas was not seen by Thomas until five minutes later, and it took another three minutes to implement. Therefore, the distance between the two squadrons increased from the predetermined five nautical miles to ten nautical miles. Such a large gap later had a detrimental effect on the British forces. Secondly, at 3:30 PM, when Beatty was deploying for battle, he ordered Thomas to "advance towards the East (77 degrees) at the full speed of 25 knots." Rear Admiral Thomas hesitated. Why? Because the German Hipper Squadron was in the process of executing a double right-angle turn to the south, and the battle would inevitably occur not in the "East" but in the "South-East." But according to the commander's order, he steered east (77 degrees), and only the third signal changed it to South-East (122 degrees).</p>
<p>By the time this deployment was completed, it was too late. The German and British forces began to engage, and soon the British ship Invincible was sunk. The Thomas Squadron watched the tragic scene of black flames engulfing the sky, without firing a single shot in participation. Although they possessed the largest 15-inch guns of the German and British forces, they were merely rushing to the battlefield at full speed. The firepower of the Barham, the flagship of the Thomas Squadron, barely reached the German rearguard ship Von der Tann, but it was already ten minutes after the start of the battle. These were indeed extremely valuable ten minutes, and also ten minutes of great loss for the British forces.</p>
<p>What would a Japanese admiral do? He certainly would not issue a signal like Beatty's. Different from the direction and speed command at 3:30 PM, he would simply order: "I immediately demand a decisive battle in the South-South-East, cutting off the enemy's retreat. All squadrons participate in the shortest possible time! Immediately!" Japanese commanders do not issue detailed orders to flag officers. They only state their intention for a decisive battle and the direction of attack, allowing them to exert their best efforts, and if there is anything inappropriate, they immediately adopt a method of corrective guidance.</p>
<p>Then, what would a Japanese commander in Rear Admiral Thomas's position do? After receiving the commander's order and understanding his intention, he would immediately turn to the right at 3:30 PM, so as to burst into the predictable battlefield in twenty minutes. Rather than deploying in a single line astern behind Beatty's main force in the South-South-East, he would try to become the vanguard, using his unique 15-inch guns to attack the enemy's front lines. In this way, the Thomas Squadron could cut off the German Hipper Squadron from the Westa Squadron (main force), staging a fierce battle that would force it towards the Danish coast.</p>
<p>Strategically, compared from the root, the commander of the Japanese Second Fleet would never dream of competing with the commander of the Combined Fleet for the affiliation of powerful units. Private opinions requesting the Naval General Staff to increase their strength would be absolutely regarded as an inappropriate concept and rejected. Therefore, if the Thomas Squadron were in Japan's situation, it should have been the commander (Jellicoe's position) who would have headed to the decisive battle scene. Also, if it had been transferred to the battlecruiser fleet five days prior, they would have been paying attention to recognizing the tactics of the second commander (Beatty's position) day and night. They would be working hard to make themselves a true right-hand man of the new commander, and the new commander would also come up with various methods to control him.</p>
<p>In the first battle of the Battle of Jutland, the British forces were fighting with a mismatched fleet, and in the meantime, they lost two large warships, allowing the German forces to make a name for themselves. What a pity!</p>
<p>(4) Utmost Fear of Deployment</p>
<p>Next is the famous "Fleet Deployment." Among the several reasons that determined the victory or defeat of the Battle of Jutland, the biggest was the battle deployment of the Royal Battleship Fleet around 6 PM. This involved the problem of the timing and impropriety of deploying six columns, each with four ships, into a single column of twenty-four ships.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, it has already been explained in considerable detail when explaining the course of the battle, so it will not be repeated here. It will just be summarized into the following three points to serve as a basis for criticism:</p>
<p>(1) Deploying on the starboard side at 5:55 PM was the best tactic.</p>
<p>(2) The deployment at 6:15 PM should also have been done on the starboard side (southwest).</p>
<p>(3) Jellicoe deployed on the port side (east).</p>
<p>That day, sunset in the northern North Sea was at 8:19 PM, so although there were still more than two hours of gun battle time, as the results showed, it was by no means sufficient time. In order to achieve a "decisive battle," the gun battle should have started earlier. Therefore, Jellicoe could have deployed twenty minutes earlier than he actually did. Why? Because the Thomas Squadron, at 5:55 PM, discovered the German main force at a distance of 18,000 yards and reported it to Jellicoe. Beatty's report identified them as the Hipper Squadron, lacking consistency; however, the enemy's location was more than 90% accurate, and an admiral who demanded a decisive battle early on should have decided to deploy at this time. Even if the opponent was Hipper's battlecruiser squadron, there was no reason why the time would not be sufficient, and it would not have been too late to carry out a battle turn against the Westa Squadron afterwards.</p>
<p>However, Jellicoe, at 5:55 PM, 6:00 PM, and 6:05 PM, asked in all directions, "Where are the enemy's battleships?" While heading south, he always wanted to grasp the position of the Westa Squadron without the slightest mistake. This was more of a desire, but it was actually for preparation. In his book "The Grand Fleet," he inadvertently revealed this idea:</p>
<p>"The German main battleship fleet, with a powerful torpedo boat squadron gathered in its vanguard, was probing our fleet's deployment. At that time, there was a great danger of a major torpedo attack, so when deploying, I keenly felt the need to take precautions first."</p>
<p>Therefore, Jellicoe encountered an enemy he was extremely fearful of, and even kept it secret from the commanders until the moment he implemented the deployment direction. In other words, in his mind, rather than the enemy's battleship fleet that he wanted to attack, the enemy's torpedo boat squadron that wanted to attack him occupied his thoughts.</p>
<p>(5) Confusion of the Ideas of Destruction and Defense</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, there is one more thing that should be explained. Jellicoe was very fearful of the German torpedo boat squadron, which is clear from the strategic basic items he presented to the Admiralty on October 30, 1914, where he emphasized this point in bold letters. He said:</p>
<p>"Is the movement of the fleet without a single mistake possible? But before our Grand Fleet opens fire, there is no guarantee that half of it will not be buried by the enemy's underwater attacks. Therefore, I always keep this kind of attack in mind and firmly believe that there is an absolute need to consider tactics to successfully prevent the enemy's torpedo boat attacks."</p>
<p>This letter of opinion consisted of twelve items, but the Admiralty immediately issued a document of "full approval." Jellicoe used this as an amulet to implement a "safety first strategy"; therefore, if the battle deployment of the Battle of Jutland was said to be "implemented based on the policy of avoiding attacks by the German torpedo boat squadron," then one could throw a fit and hide behind the doors of the Admiralty. Our conclusion is that the then First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill should bear a large part of the responsibility.</p>
<p>Jellicoe also admitted in his writings that the German torpedo boat squadron was the best in the world, and he had been fearful of those eighty-eight destroyers since before the war. But the German destroyers that appeared at Jutland numbered sixty-one, and only thirty-one belonged directly to the Westa Squadron and were listed on the non-combat side of the main force. The shape that Jellicoe was worried about was not discovered at all. In other words, his maximum paranoia actually delayed the establishment of a decisive battle posture.</p>
<p>However, the starboard deployment mentioned in (1) above (5:55 PM) is a deployment that the Japanese commander would have resolutely implemented. In this way, with the Marlborough squadron (Vice Admiral Burnaby) on the extreme right wing as the front, the main battle squadron would be heading on a course of 224 degrees, with the Beatty squadron in front and the Thomas Squadron as the vanguard, achieving an ideal position (the latter two squadrons could execute a double right-angle turn). Thus, the posture of encircling the German forces, who had deployed a single column with thirty-three large ships, from the left would be successful. Then, at the latest by 6:05 PM, the British heavy guns could open fire.</p>
<p>Not only that, this starboard deployment at 5:55 PM was a kind of heart-pounding, terrifying surprise attack on the German main force, for which even terms like "unexpected event" and "trouble arising from within" could not fully express the feeling. It seemed like a large crocodile had appeared from behind. Why? Because the German Admiral Scheer believed that the British main force was in the north-northeast (Rear Admiral Boedicker mistakenly identified the British battlecruiser squadron Invincible as Jellicoe's main force), and he was calculating what kind of tactics to use when it appeared in that direction. Therefore, if the British forces had deployed from the starboard side and appeared in the west-northwest, then the German forces would have had to stand by and watch for a while, allowing them to be taken by surprise. Moreover, Admiral Scheer underestimated the time of the British forces' appearance by thirty minutes, so regardless of time or location, the British forces could have taken the initiative completely.

<p>Amidst the frequent victories reported in the Greater East Asia War, the second Navy Memorial Day on May 27 is rapidly approaching. Looking back thirty-eight years, our Japanese ancestors, embracing the declaration of war, went to battle in the Sea of Japan. In the Tsushima Strait, they captured and annihilated the Russian fleet that had come with ambitions to dominate the Far East. Reviewing the past thirty-eight years, it cannot be said to be a long time. From the perspective of the long Japanese history, it is just a very short moment. However, what has been achieved during these thirty-eight years under the might of the Japanese Navy can be compared to thousands of years of history. Now, the Japanese Navy is using the spirit of attack passed down from its ancestors to engage in fierce battles to destroy the enemy in the decisive arenas of the south, north, and mainland China. Thirty-eight years ago, the Japanese ancestors, in order to cut off Russia's evil hand of invasion in East Asia, rose up with determination. Now, for the same purpose, to destroy the great enemy of East Asia for a hundred years, Great Britain and the United States, they have once again raised the beacon of holy war. The Navy Memorial Day, which Japan takes pride in, is being enthusiastically welcomed not only in Japan itself but also in the countries of East Asia. In the Shanghai area, from the 21st until the 30th, the anniversary of Marshal Tōgō's death, it has been designated as a commemoration week for joint celebrations. The following are the programs for the commemoration week determined by the civilian sector:</p>

<h3 id="e26">Details of the Trial of the Zhang Jinhai Case <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The case of the French Concession constabulary detective torturing and coercing young Zhang Jinhai to death was reopened at the Special No. 2 Court yesterday (20th) at 10:30 AM. The audience seats were filled with people, and Japanese military police, central tax police, and court police maintained order. However, the constabulary's investigation of the case was not yet completed, so it was scheduled for continued trial at 9:30 AM on the 31st of this month in the First Criminal Court. Yesterday, only Zhang Yuebo, Zhang Yuanji, Peng Shuanglong, and others were summoned for questioning. Zhang and Peng's testimonies vividly described the details of the torture, and the audience shed tears of sympathy. The family has formally filed a lawsuit regarding Peng Shuanglong's injuries.</p>
<p>Chief Judge Qian Senting Presides Personally</p>
<p>Chief Judge Qian Senting of the Criminal Court personally presided over the trial yesterday. First, the defendants Ji Xiuying, Guo Shiyuan, Feng Quansheng, Li Mingda, Zhu Songcheng, Zai Shu, and six others were brought to the court. Xu Wufang, the constabulary's lawyer, immediately stood up and stated that the constabulary's investigation of the case was not yet completed, so he requested the Chief Judge to postpone the trial for another ten days. Chief Judge Qian asked if they could expedite the investigation and complete it in a short period. Lawyer Xu replied that due to the complexity of the case, it could not be completed in less than ten days. Chief Judge Qian then summoned Zhang Yuebo and others for questioning.</p>
<p>Peng Shuanglong Testifies</p>
<p>"I am from Danyang, 17 years old. I have a mother, sister, and younger sister at home. Zhang Yuebo is my cousin. I can't remember when I started working at the store, but it was roughly only two weeks before the incident. I was a student, not serving customers. I don't know if Li Xiuying came to the store to buy something." (Question and Answer abbreviated as Q&amp;A below) Q: Did you know that she came to the store the next day to negotiate? A: "I didn't know about her first visit. I was drying clothes upstairs when the detectives came with him (pointing to Feng Quansheng in court). He forced me to take the clothes and handcuffed me, taking me back to the police station. Zhu Songcheng and Li Songsheng beat me. A foreign police officer (No. 23) punched me and kicked me. Zhu also hit me with a thick stick. I refused to admit it, so they took me to another room. The foreigner wanted to pick me up and slam me down, demanding that I confess, and said to me, 'Didn't you see someone else take it?' At this time, I couldn't take it anymore, so I said nonsense: the paper was upstairs in the store. Then Detective Zhu took me to the store, but there was no paper to take. Then Kang Wanqing was brought in." Q: What happened later? A: Later, I talked nonsense again, and they beat me again. I said it seemed like Zhang Jinhai had picked up a piece of paper, but I didn't know if it was it. Zhu Songcheng brought me to the store, and Jinhai was brought in. Then another foreigner (pointing to Miller) locked us in another room. Translator Li and Miller beat us, hitting Jinhai's buttocks with a door bolt. (Q:) "Were there any outsiders when they were hitting you?" (A:) "Yes, he (pointing to Guo Shiyuan). He also asked us if we took it. When we didn't admit it, they slapped us. (Q:) "Did he speak to the foreigners?" He spoke to the second foreigner, but I didn't understand. He also spoke to the foreigner while they were hitting Jinhai. (Q:) How often did the person surnamed Guo hit you? (A:) I don't remember clearly. (Q:) Were you still handcuffed after they poured water on you? (A:) It had been removed. (Q:) Did they hit you again? Later, I was knocked down and beaten on the ground by the detective. (Q:) What happened later? (A:) We two slept in the prison cell, under one quilt. When dawn broke, Jinhai wanted to drink tea, but he didn't have the strength to get up, and there was no tea to drink. He just leaned on the iron railing, completely exhausted. By the time it was just dawn, Jinhai had died. (Q:) Did you know when Zhang Jinhai died and was taken away? (A:) I knew. They also took me to another room to ask questions. (Q:) What did they ask? (A:) They asked if Zhang Jinhai died in the police station. I said yes, the foreigner beat him to death in the station. (Q:) What happened to you later? (A:) Later, they locked me up in the underground prison and told us, if anyone asks you later, just say the foreigner only slapped Zhang Jinhai once. (Q:) Were there other people in the prison cell? (A:) There were many people. (Q:) When did they release you? (A:) They released me the next evening. (Q:) What did you eat in the prison? (A:) I ate prison food, but I couldn't swallow it," and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Responding to the North China Disaster Relief: Hoping for Support from All Sectors <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Due to the disaster and famine in North China, the provinces of Shandong and Henan are experiencing food shortages due to transportation issues. Starving people are seen on the roads. Even members of the middle class have become beggars. The tragic situation is heartbreaking to those who hear of it. The following is an overview of the situation in the old capital, as reported by those returning to Shanghai from North China:</p>
<p>Current Situation in the Old Capital</p>
<p>Those suffering the most from this food shortage are the educated class. The political path has become narrower, making the lives of intellectuals increasingly difficult. However, intellectuals still value their reputation. Fearing the scorn of their neighbors, those living in the eastern part of the city beg for food in the western part, and those living in the western part beg in the eastern part. The working class mostly makes a living by pulling rickshaws. Due to the food shortage, business has plummeted. Unable to do otherwise, they have no choice but to abandon their rickshaws and beg on the streets. Landlords have increased rents in the past year, but the increase is far less than what is needed for essential goods. As a result, there is a large gap between income and expenses. These people have no way to sustain themselves and have become beggars.</p>

<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng is a figure of great social prestige. He leads the Shanghai business community in various public welfare endeavors, taking the lead in responding. Given the severity of the disaster in North China, Mr. Yuan generously decided to sell fifty boxes of the most valuable cigars given to him by friends, in order to aid the disaster victims and to encourage others. Mr. Yang Fusheng, the owner of Heming Shoes and Hats Store, magnanimously wrote to this newspaper, willing to be the first to buy the cigars for charity. His letter stated: "Mr. Yuan Ludeng's valuable cigars at home are piled up on the ground, almost reaching the height of a person. Anyone who has seen them sighs in admiration. Yesterday, for the sake of North China disaster relief, Mr. Yuan expressed his intention to cut back on smoking and food, and to sell these cigars for charity. In the Old Book of Tang, there is a phrase: 'Reward him with gold equal to his height.' Today, Mr. Yuan can be said to be 'donating cigars equal to his height.' Now, Fusheng is willing to contribute 10,000 yuan to purchase these famous cigars. I wonder if Mr. Yuan is willing to part with them? However, I am not a smoker, so even if the cigars are good, what use are they to me? It would be better to transfer them to someone else. Therefore, in accordance with the bidding method, please let your newspaper preside over the open bidding, with the minimum price being the original price of 10,000 yuan. All proceeds from the bidding will be used for disaster relief, benefiting the disaster victims and fulfilling Mr. Yuan's good intentions. As the old saying goes, 'Relief of hunger does not require a grand feast, and rescuing the drowning does not wait for proper procedures.' Fusheng is merely doing his best. Yang Fusheng, May 20th." He also enclosed a check for 10,000 yuan. It is expected that all sectors of the Shanghai business community will be inspired by this news. This newspaper, with its mission of serving society, will do its best. We invite all bidders to submit their bids to this newspaper immediately. The highest bidder will obtain these famous cigars, subject to further consultation and decision with Mr. Yuan. Mr. Yang's payment will be temporarily held in the social services department of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e31">Some Points Regarding Urgent Accounts for North China <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the urgent relief for the disaster victims in North China, this newspaper has already written articles appealing for help. However, our intentions are not yet fully expressed, so we reiterate our views as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The day before yesterday, at the tea party of Chief Chen and Chief Ding, our reporter proposed on the spot the establishment of an urgent relief organization in Shanghai for North China, to handle relief matters in a unified manner, so that authority would be concentrated and the effect of rapid action could be achieved. At that time, Minister Ding also considered it necessary and agreed to plan for its establishment and announcement. Secretary-General Zhao also advocated careful selection of personnel. We not only hope for an early establishment, but also agree with Secretary-General Zhao's proposal that the core personnel should be mainly socially just individuals with a good reputation, while government agencies should be in a position to promote and supervise, so that the steps taken by all parties are consistent and efforts are not wasted.</p>
<p>(2) "Disaster relief is like fighting a fire." This newspaper has advocated that from fundraising to on-site distribution, the first stage should be completed in one month. Minister Ding, in consideration of the facts, set the period at two months, but time flies, and even two months will soon pass. We further hope for the speedy establishment of a unified agency to promote all urgent relief work.</p>
<p>(3) Yesterday, Mr. Yang Fusheng wrote, willing to purchase Mr. Yuan Ludeng's cigars, which were "turned into relief goods," for 10,000 yuan, and suggested using a bidding method with 10,000 yuan as the minimum price, with all proceeds used as donations. Mr. Yang, since he does not smoke and does not want to enjoy them alone, had already sent 1,000 yuan in Joint Reserve Bank Certificates to this newspaper to be collected as donations the day before yesterday. This spirit of mutual assistance and sympathy is truly admirable. We hope that powerful readers will participate in the bidding, "benefiting the disaster victims and fulfilling Mr. Yuan's good intentions," and also echoing Mr. Yang's enthusiasm.</p>
<p>(4) Various activities aimed at charitable donations should be launched, such as charity soccer matches, charity drama and film performances, etc. We hope that those who participate in these events will fulfill their obligations, try their best to reduce the necessary administrative expenses, and hire renowned accountants such as Mr. Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, and Wang Haifan to audit the accounts on a voluntary basis, ensuring that every penny of the donations is used for public purposes and to replenish the funds.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Bombing of Jingji Airdrome in Jian'ou - Spokesman for the Japanese News Department Spoke to the Press Corps Yesterday <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai held its routine reception for the Chinese press corps of this city yesterday (20th) at 3:00 PM. At the regular meeting, the Japanese spokesperson reported on the purpose of the Japanese Air Force's destruction of the US-China Air Force base in Jian'ou, Fujian. The spokesperson first stated that the news of the Japanese Air Force bombing Jian'ou Airport carried in today's newspapers should be examined. Jian'ou Airport is now being used by the US-China Air Force as a base for air raids against Japan. Initially, the US used Guilin as a base, attempting to attack Japan, but because it was impossible, they moved the base to Jian'ou, plotting a possible attack on Kyushu, Japan. The aircraft stationed at this airfield are B-24 heavy bombers. The US is painstakingly plotting various planned attempts to attack Japan. Recently, the Japanese military has been closely watching and severely destroying these attempts. This bombing of the US-China airfield in Jian'ou is a preemptive strike to crush their dreams of attacking. If the US takes such action, Japan will continue to bomb and extinguish it. If the US actions were to succeed, it would inevitably suffer guerrilla-style harassment. Therefore, the Japanese military will never allow the US's dreams of harassment to exist and will severely attack them until the enemy is unable to act, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Agricultural Loans as a Good Outlet for the Financial Industry in the Future <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Our country is founded on agriculture, and the countryside is the foundation of the national economy. Its prosperity and decline are of great importance to the national destiny. In recent years, the countryside has been depleted, and people's livelihoods have become increasingly difficult. Examining the reasons, although there are several, the adverse trade balance between the countryside and the city has led to the concentration of funds in the city, making it difficult for the countryside to circulate funds. This is a major problem that many contemporary scholars have already discussed, so there is no need to repeat it. Recently, the financial industry has recognized the current situation, and is doing its best to provide assistance, as its duty lies, and it cannot shirk its responsibility. Therefore, the banks that have recently handled agricultural loans include the China Bank, the Communications Bank, the Jiangsu Bank, and the Fuxing Bank. The procedures for agricultural loans handled by each bank are complicated, and the interest rates are low, which is a special difficulty. However, farmers value credit and bad debts are not common. Therefore, investing in the countryside is a good outlet for the surplus funds of our banking industry. Currently, if the banks can cooperate in handling agricultural loans, the advantages are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The collapse of the countryside is becoming more and more serious. If this continues, even the false prosperity of the city will decline due to the collapse of the foundation. When the nest is overturned, will there be any unbroken eggs? Timely rescue is an action for the banking industry to get to the bottom of things.</p>
<p>(2) The procedures for agricultural loans are indeed more complicated, but according to experience, farmers pay attention to credit and bad debts are not common, so it is still a good investment path for the banking industry.</p>
<p>(3) In the past, Shanghai colleagues have achieved good results in handling agricultural loans. Although they knew that the capital was heavy and the profits were light, they were still able to work hard and make progress, which has been well received by society. Each bank should take the lead as soon as possible, which can win the goodwill of the public.</p>
<p>(4) Agricultural loans must go deep into the interior, close to the farmers, and the business of each bank can also be spread to various places, deeply into the people, invisibly increasing a strong asset for the financial industry.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Flour and Wheat Special Committee Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Special Committee, under the command and supervision of the Ministry of Food and the National Commerce and Trade Council, has been prepared and held an inaugural meeting ceremony at the Hua Mao Hotel on the ninth floor at 4:30 PM yesterday (20th). At the same time, a tea party was held for all sectors, attended by hundreds of officials from Chinese and Japanese agencies and representatives from the financial and industrial sectors. Sun Zhongli, chairman of the committee, reported on the preparations. Minister Gu Baoheng of the Ministry of Food and Minister Tajiri of the Allied Nations gave instructions successively. Mayor Chen's representative, Secretary Zhao Zunyue, delivered a speech. Finally, Tang Shoumin, chairman of the Commerce and Trade Council, gave a thank-you speech, and the meeting ended happily at about 6 o'clock.</p>
<p>Chairman's Inaugural Report</p>
<p>Chairman Sun Zhongli's report briefly stated: This committee is one of the internal institutions of the National Commerce and Trade Council. It was the first to start organizing among the various professional committees. Everything has no precedent to follow. Today, I am fortunate to announce its establishment. This is due to the deep understanding and trust given to the industry by the Chinese and Japanese authorities, giving the industry the opportunity for autonomy, and it should be attributed to the guidance of both the Ministry of Food and the Commerce and Trade Council. My strength is weak, and I am truly wary of "being on the brink of an abyss" for the progress of the work. But I will try my best to do it. If there are any achievements, I will be grateful for the various assistance given by the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the enthusiastic cooperation of my colleagues. In the event of encountering difficulties in the middle and failing to achieve the ideal goal, I will ask the two governments to give practical instructions on solutions. This is my urgent hope.</p>
<p>Instructions from Minister Gu of the Ministry of Grains</p>
<p>Minister Gu's instructions briefly stated: Since our government accepted the good intentions of the Allied Nations last month and returned the material management rights, there has been the organization of the General Council of Commerce and Trade, with the trade associations and their federations in each industry as its lower-level institutions. Furthermore, for the convenience of execution, there is the organization of this Flour and Wheat Committee for flour and wheat. In a short period of time, it was able to be successfully established, which is commendable. The trade associations and regional federations in each major grain and material area under the Ministry of Grain have been established one after another. In the future, each industry should be guided by the Commerce and Trade Council to carry out its business and carry out concrete operations. As for the establishment of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee, I sincerely hope that it can exert its strength and serve as a model for other industries. I also hope that this committee will take the purpose of specializing in the interests of its peers. In addition, it should also aim at the welfare of farmers and consumers, the rationalization of industry operations, and the reduction of costs and expenses.</p>

<p>The National Commerce and Trade Council convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, chaired by Chairman Tang, to approve the rules of procedure for the Flour and Wheat Special Committee and to appoint members of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee and the Sugar Special Committee.

In order to handle matters in a unified manner, a telegram has been sent to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting that the spot checks on cotton yarn and cotton cloth be handled by the Investigation Committee.</p>

<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau, in view of the fact that industry associations in the city have recently been printing price lists of goods that have not been approved by the Bureau and distributing them to various merchants for implementation, which is not in conformity with the regulations of the Central Provisional Regulations for Stabilizing Prices, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for Suppressing Private Price Increases, in order to effectively prevent abuses, has specially ordered that all industry associations should submit all printed price lists to the Bureau for inspection in advance. Only after the inspection seal is affixed can they be distributed for implementation. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be severely punished. It is reported that this regulation has been approved by the Municipal Government for implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Hua Share Trends <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hua share market was mediocre, and the prices of all shares were sluggish, with minimal increases and decreases, and transactions were very scarce. The once most active New Pharmaceutical Stock also saw a scarcity of demand. The Sino-French Pharmacy still hovered within the customs, and remained unresponsive, lacking any vigor. The New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory was bought by investors after a decline, and eventually broke even. The selling price of the Great China Match Company continued to rise, and the Nanyang Tobacco Company also saw a slight increase. In the department store industry, Wing On and Sun Sun once declined, but the final price was not much different from the previous day. The National Goods Company remained at the original price. In the textile industry, Wing On Spinning and Meea Silk Weaving went in opposite directions, with the former being weak and the latter slightly firm. The China Underwear Company did not see much trading, and the price was also weak and listless. The remaining small denomination textile industry shares saw mostly scarce trading and stagnant prices. In the cultural industry, the selling price of the Commercial Press was slightly higher, while the China and World Book Companies saw less change. In the public utility sector, Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Electric each saw a small increase. New Eagle Real Estate saw few buyers for its new shares, slightly lower than the previous day, and Jiu'an Industrial also saw many sell-offs. Jingfu Sock Factory saw new investors buying in, and the price was progressing.</p>

<h3 id="e44">The Significance of the National Commercial Control Council's Transfer to the Executive Yuan <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - The 15th Supreme National Defense Conference passed many important cases, among which the transfer of the National Commercial Control Council to the Executive Yuan is noteworthy. The significance of the establishment of the Council is of great importance, as it lies in adjusting the organization of various industry associations, improving the past weaknesses, so that they can generate strong power, and can convey information upwards and downwards. Now that it is transferred to the Executive Yuan, not only will the organization of the Council be further strengthened in the future, but it can also be directly directed by the Executive Yuan for smooth operation. Therefore, the purpose of this move is roughly of several kinds: (1) To strengthen the investigation of materials control, (2) To establish the system and management method between the investigating authorities and the commercial control agencies, (3) The overall organization of the control council and its lower-level organizations can benefit from being more thorough, (4) It can better adapt to the current actual situation, (5) The abolition of supervisory officials is to make the commercial control system popular among the people.</p>

<h3 id="e45">The Division of Love and Hate <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Yanchu</p>
<p>The bee, it is the most diligent of animals. Every spring and summer, it spreads its innate wings and weaves back and forth between the fields, collecting nectar, fighting for survival, and using its own strength to seek the continuation of its life. This is the most logical way of survival and the characteristic of the bee.</p>
<p>Teachers, clerks... and other salaried people, they use their innate bodies and brains all day long to exchange for various essential materials, using the noblest and purest methods to seek survival, with the same characteristics as bees. Therefore, I say that teachers and clerks are like bees.</p>
<p>The cunning of the fox is well known to women and children. The mention of a fox evokes a kind of dislike. On the one hand, it is because of its unpleasant appearance, and the biggest reason is that it speculates and takes advantage of others. It often puts aside its own limbs and specializes in luring other creatures to hunt for things. Its way of survival is somewhat like a group of speculators and hoarders among humans. They use insidious and vicious means to plunder the results of other people's labor and are despised by people.</p>
<p>Bees and foxes are both animals; teachers, clerks, and hoarding gentlemen are all human beings. Due to the different ways of survival, mentioning bees, teachers, and clerks will make people admire and love them; talking about foxes and hoarding gentlemen will make people abandon them. Perhaps this is the division of love and hate for mankind!</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Bright and Dark Sides of the Shanghai Theater Scene <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Little Window</p>
<p>It should be said that after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Shanghai Drama Society, with its long history, and the Shanghai Professional Drama Troupe, which had many excellent actors, both announced their dissolution one after another. At that time, the only existing troupe with a history was the China Travel Drama Troupe, which staged some new plays that did not attract attention, and a troupe organized by some people using movie stars as a gimmick, which staged a few of Cao Yu's plays, but otherwise there was little activity. But not long after, Rongwei Company, organized by some former members of the Drama Society and the Shanghai Professional Troupe, staged several plays based on Ba Jin's "Spring" and "Autumn" and Cao Yu's "Gilding," etc. The theater scene, which had been silent for a while, seemed to have revived, but it soon dissolved and split again.</p>
<p>Following this, Yao Ke's "Chu Bawang" was staged at the Lyceum Theatre, but the results were not satisfactory. At the same time, the Shanghai Art Theatre, presided over by Fei Mu, was established and performed for a long period. The first play was "Yang Guifei," written and directed by Fei Mu, and it attempted to enhance the atmosphere of the performance with music, which resulted in very good results. Thus, Shanghai Art Theatre decided that every play afterwards would have the rhythm of an orchestra. The second play was Yuan Muzhi's adaptation of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," co-directed by Ma-Xu Weibang and Fei Mu. This play depicted the ugliness of the upper class, the simplicity, ignorance, and lovable dullness of the lower class, and a cry for freedom. The directors created a unique and new style, giving the audience an indelible impression. The performances of "Hero of the Deserted Island" and "The Second Dream" followed, both of which were plays translated from Barrie's original works. The plot was very profound, the satire on life was very intense, and it had a very deep suggestion of the errors of life. The successive performances of these two plays undoubtedly also gave the audience a good impression. Later, there were performances of "The Money Tree" and "Fourth Sister," etc., and the results were also quite good. The Shanghai Art Theatre was very hardworking during this period. Perhaps it was due to the inability to sell tickets? Performances at the Carlton Theatre were discontinued. The next performance was the China Art Drama Troupe's "The Human World," written by Hu Tiwei, and then "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" and "Important Events in Life" were staged. Except for "Important Events in Life," which was barely satisfactory, the results were not very good. Then, the Shanghai Art Theatre expanded its internal organization and added a group of hard-working personnel, and staged Shi Tuo's "The Circus," starring Shi Hui and Yingzi, etc. Ticket sales were not weak, and the staging of Li Zhihua's "Between Men and Women" was also above standard. Then, "Autumn Begonia" was staged. A large amount of manpower and material resources were spent on this play. Because it catered to the low-level interests of the petty bourgeoisie, ticket sales were extraordinarily high, a miracle unprecedented in the theater scene, but it was difficult to obtain the approval of audiences who loved art.</p>
<p>The Yiguang Drama Troupe was established and staged Li Jianwu's "Yun Caixia" and Western plays such as "Sweet Sister," "Dinner Party," and "Spring Boudoir Customs," Fang Junyi's "Qinhuai Moon," and Huang Zongjiang's "The Earth," all of which were up to standard. In particular, "Dinner Party" was a world-famous play, adapted by Shi Huaifu, and director Hong Mo's techniques were also very novel. The actors, including Lan Lan, Huang Zongjiang, Hu Dao, and Jiang Tianliu, etc., also had good acting skills, but they could not sell tickets, which must be the theater scene's dilemma.</p>
<p>The new theater, Lihua Grand Theatre, was opened, and the Zhongzhong Drama Troupe, organized by some actors from China Travel Drama Troupe, performed. They staged Zhou Yibai's "Spring River Flower Moon," Xia Xia's "Widow's Home," Luo Ming's "Lu Manzi," and other plays such as "Little Women," "Les Misérables," and "The Glamorous Country," etc., all of which used individuals as a gimmick. Although they had a large audience, the results were not necessarily good, and recently performances have been discontinued.</p>
<p>The Jindu Theatre was converted into a drama theater, and the Shanglian Drama Troupe was established, performing regularly at the Jindu. The first play was "Flower Signal Wind," written by Li Jianwu and directed by Wu Renzhi. The second play was Chen Baichen's "Wedding March." The writer used realistic subject matter to expose the ugliness of society as much as possible, suggesting the immediate problems of young people. How can the problem of marriage be solved? Director Zhang Jie's handling was also very concise. The actors, except for some who were slightly lacking, performed very diligently. This was one of the rare plays recently. "A Line of Sky" also had a very pure theme, but it could not sell tickets. Was this the reason? Then, Zhang Henshui's novel "Man Jiang Hong" was brought to the stage, also using the gimmick of joint writing and directing by all directors and joint performance by all actors. Although they had their difficulties, the decline in standards cannot be denied.</p>
<p>These are the outlines of the theater scene in recent years, telling us that in terms of quantity, one drama theater has one troupe performing, the number of performance venues is increasing, and the number of performing troupes is also increasing. Of course, the audience is also increasing. In terms of quantity, it is considered very sufficient. It seems that the theater scene is quite lively. In terms of quality, some theater people have gone to perform in other places, and some have stopped doing theater. Although new talents have emerged, with the increase in troupes, it is difficult to cope. The director of this troupe is also the director of that troupe, and the actors of this troupe are also the actors of that troupe. The playwrights similarly write plays for this troupe and also write plays for that troupe, etc. In order to compete for business, each troupe pays attention to which actor has many audience members who love his acting skills, and pays a lot of money to invite him to star in the play. Some troupes, in order to prevent actors from joining another troupe, raise their compensation, increasing the salaries of so-called backbone actors. The salaries of some actors without status are still pitifully low. On the one hand, theaters are raising seat prices without limit under the slogan of increasing profits and maintaining expenses, and some art-loving audiences are being squeezed out and cannot step inside. In order to sell tickets, they are thinking about whether each play has gimmicks for the audience, and the plot is not paid attention to. Joint writing and directing by all, plays written on topics, regardless of whether they are meaningful, and say things in a well-organized manner, exposing darkness, indicating light, the true meaning of love, anti-feudalism, a long list of pleasant words, all deviate from the meaning of drama. Doing drama is to promote the theater movement, but it has been taken as a goal to make money. Although actors' lives also need to be maintained, there should not be excessive enjoyment. These are all the dark sides of the theater scene. On the other hand, there are also some people who do drama who have always stood in their position and worked very hard. They sometimes endure hunger and all kinds of difficulties and continue to do it. In order to protect the life of the troupe, they suppress their tears and walk in a direction they do not want to go. May these promising artists no longer linger on the idea of selling tickets. Doing drama is for eating, but don't forget the meaning of doing drama work – to work hard to promote the theater movement.</p>

<p>— Oshita Udaer</p>
<p>(1) The Miraculous Scarf</p>
<p>On that historic day of the start of the war, Pearl Harbor was hidden from her true face by thick [clouds].</p>
<p>"Ah! There it is!" Before our naval aircraft discovered it, there was real anxiety and worry. The [cloud] layer did not completely seal off the entire world, and in its gaps, the military port was discovered.</p>
<p>However, it is said that our air force initially almost missed this most important [gap].</p>
<p>At that time, a brave warrior on board a certain aircraft was wearing a scarf around his neck. It was a scarf specially made by this warrior's sister, who thought about the cold when flying in an airplane at altitudes of several thousand meters, before the sortie. When the aircraft was searching over Pearl Harbor, the line of sight was blocked by thick cloud layers. The military port that was to be searched for could not be found. At that time, the wind speed on the ground was seventeen meters. They were really thinking that a storm was about to strike! Sure enough, the scarf around the warrior's neck was suddenly blown off by the wind. Alas! What a pity! The warrior turned his head and looked diagonally behind him in mid-air to see where the scarf was falling, and then he saw a [gap] there. In an instant, the cloud gap flew in front of him. As if in a dream, he discovered a large area of Pearl Harbor. The heavy black shadows of enemy ships were scattered there, and were clearly visible.</p>
<p>The warrior shouted with joy.</p>
<p>Thus, our large naval aircraft broke through the cloud layer, flew over the military port, and launched an unprecedentedly magnificent bombing, gaining a major victory that is forever worth commemorating.</p>
<p>(2) Arduous Endurance</p>
<p>Everyone knows the [submarine] that first discovered the "Prince of Wales" and the "Repulse". Regarding that discovery, perhaps there is something strange, but I have not heard any legends about it yet.</p>
<p>But the endurance of this submarine is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>"The long-awaited period is about to come. The insatiable British and Americans could be attacked as soon as they were seen at that time." A certain sergeant – who self-bombed on a naval aircraft in the South China area in the autumn of Showa 16 – said this when he returned on vacation. He had been to Chongqing more than twenty times. The one thing he regretted was that although Chongqing was covered in bomb scars, the area where the British and Americans lived had never been bombed, and was safe and sound. Going there, he always thought that even if he could drop a bomb, it would be good to vent the hatred in his chest, but in fact, not a single bomb was allowed to fall in that area, so he was tearful when he spoke. Soon there was finally an air battle with the British and Americans, and as soon as he saw the British and Americans, British and American things, everything British and American, he could bomb them at any time and anywhere. Unfortunately, he had already passed away before this. The submarines in the waters off Malaysia believed that the first bomb they fired would not be enough to kill the enemy. In an environment lacking supplies and with ammunition and food exhausted, they still resolutely dived into the water. In their minds, there was only the contact mission of spying on the whereabouts of enemy ships, and transmitting their discovery to the air force.</p>
<p>This endurance is commendable. They can read their achievements to others, they only seek to complete their goals and do not ask for anything else. (Note: Translated from the four Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<p>— Zhang Xi</p>
<p>At present, there is a shortage of paper, and problems have arisen with textbooks for students. The psychology of general educators is that, for levels above senior elementary school, the textbooks selected should be thick and large books, with each volume between two and three hundred pages, believing that this is necessary to highlight the level of the students. In reality, only a few dozen pages of each book are taught each semester. When it comes to the time of further education, the remaining books from the previous semester are discarded and useless, which is really a pity. At a time when everything is expensive and the price of books is rising again and again, the price of large and thick textbooks is between twenty and thirty yuan per book, so for each student, with eight books, the value is more than two hundred yuan. This is not something that ordinary parents can afford. Moreover, although there are many names of textbooks published by major bookstores, many have been discontinued and sold out. It is quite difficult to search for textbooks, and there is a real need to cherish them. The remedy is to start from junior high school and continue to teach the original readers, so that they are not discarded, saving money and cherishing things, which is very beneficial. What do the school authorities think?</p>

<p>All the teachers of Qicheng Elementary School sent a letter yesterday, stating: Our colleague Zhou Wenjun has been teaching at this elementary school for seven or eight years, and is usually patient and tireless in his teaching. Last winter, he suddenly suffered from hemoptysis. After treatment at Renji and Zhenxin Hospitals, he gradually recovered. After hearing the news, the colleagues were all relieved. However, Zhenxin Hospital was originally established for epidemics. In a blink of an eye, the epidemic will be approaching, and other patients must be moved out. Zhou Jun is no exception. In addition, future medical and pharmaceutical expenses are needed everywhere. The colleagues are in the same situation. The past fundraising has exhausted our meager resources. We really have no ability to provide for the future. Sitting idly by and not helping, we cannot rest easy. Failing at the last hurdle is unwise. With no other option, we specially described our predicament and earnestly request your office to appeal to enthusiastic people in the community to lend a helping hand, so that he can recover soon, return to his old job, and repay the kindness with greater efforts, increase teaching effectiveness, and benefit more than one person. (According to Zhou Jun, he is a rare good teacher at present, and it is necessary to allocate funds to help him. In addition to this office donating 200 yuan, we also hope that enthusiastic readers will rise up to help, so that he can recover to health soon.)</p>

<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>It has been five years since the death of Dr. Cai Shicun, professor of Southeast Medical College. Colleagues in the medical and pharmaceutical circles of this city believe that Dr. Cai was enthusiastic about education and beneficial to society during his lifetime. They plan to leave a permanent memorial in the college during the fifth anniversary to commend him. Therefore, they held a meeting yesterday to discuss it. They all agreed that Southeast Medical College has achieved remarkable results, but unfortunately, it has suffered property losses due to the war, which is quite large. It requires a great deal of expense to add one by one. The family of Dr. Cai is willing to save 50,000 yuan for the fifth anniversary memorial service to supplement the college's expenses. It should expand the scope so that Cai's relatives and friends and people from all walks of life who admire the doctor will generally convert the gifts that should be sent into cash and allocate them to the college's expenses to promote achievements.</p>
<p>Bonsai Collection Exhibition: The Baxianqiao Youth Association will hold the second bonsai exhibition for five days starting from the 21st of this month. It will gather more than 300 works from famous masters in Shanghai, such as Kong Zhiqing, Xu Zhuodai, Zhou Shoujuan, Huang Jingwan, Yao Qiyuan, etc., in one hall, which is full of beautiful things. It is praised as the authority of bonsai in Shanghai. The proceeds from the sale will be used to organize small agricultural loans, combining charity with noble entertainment. There will also be a calligraphy and painting exhibition, with many Chinese and Western paintings by Shi Chongpeng, Xu Ziling, Shi Piao, Bai Jiao, Zhao Baishan, etc. participating in the display.</p>
