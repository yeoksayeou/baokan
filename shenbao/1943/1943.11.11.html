<h3 id="c1">重視事實　獻言於經濟施策聯絡會議 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>業部咋天起在　　舉行「地方經濟施策聯絡會議」三日，出席與議者，為各省市地方主管經濟及有關經濟長官。是會目的，據電訊所傳，為檢討過去各地方經濟設施概况，討論今後各地經濟設施推進上之聯絡事宜。總之，經過一番檢討與商議之後，以期經濟設施之更趨合理，實現國家旣定的經濟政策。</p>
<p>一國的經濟，猶似人體之血液，血液必須循環，生命才可持續；經濟必須圓滑，國脈才可生存。而經濟之如何合理圓滑，不僅維持國脈之生存，更求國　之富强，實為每個國家所應孜孜以求實現之道。經濟設施之內容，大致可分兩部門，其一是確定經濟政策，其二是執行經濟政策。確定經濟政策，是國家最高經濟機關的責任。執行經濟政策，是全國各地各有　　經濟機關的資任，也可以說全髒人民共有的責任。</p>
<p>我國確定經濟政策者是全國經濟委晨會，在本年二月第一次全體會議中，已經確定戰時經濟政策綱領。對於經濟如何圓滑，已經有了指標。至於執行經濟政策，在各省市設有經濟局以及其他專業機關。從經濟之目標及執行之機構以觀，可謂規模已具。而餘下者僅為執行之人事與努力如何而已。揆諸實際，經濟　策之確定，執行機　之設置，固然重要，然而經濟國滑之實際效能，實繫於人事之得當與否？努力之程度如何？因為人事如果失當，努力如果不够，則政策無異具文，機構不過點綴品耳，與經濟圓滑，國脈富强，更不相手。所以，我們對於國家經濟的整個觀點，固然重視政策的完善與機構的强化；而人事的廉明，執行的努力，尤其不可忽視。根據上述的觀點，對於實業部這次舉行的會議，我們站在人民立塲，期待之殷，實超過於歷次的全國經濟委員會議。尤其這次會議，以檢討過去設施及商議今後聯絡　　等量齊觀，表示出一種切實的作風，殊足稱道。我們盼望與會代表大家老老實實報告經濟設施上的困難情形，共同商議解決之道。官樣文章的成績報者，大可不必羅列。不着邊際的議案，與其空洞的錢而不決，不如節省時間而不提。於此，我們貢獻兩點意見，以供參考：</p>
<p>第一增加生產問題，我們當然知道遷問題早為政府所重視，根據政策要旨，製為推進計劃，逐步實施。但是，我們所注意的是事實，我們要求農工生產的數量，在統計數字上確實向上，我們更要求因為生產增加而物資供應圓滑，抑平物價，安定民生。同時，增加對外協力作戰的實</p>
<p>第二是物價間題，似乎也早為當局所重視實行了。可是，同樣的我們要看到事實。如何全面限價，如何消滅國積，均應取得一致方法。</p>
<p>經濟範圍至廣，自非實業部職權所可全部解決。但　業郃能就職權以內的事業充分發揮效能，樹以模範，則其他有關經濟部門當然隨之振作。願實部當局以及與會　君共起圖之。</p>

<p>東京十日中央社電　日東條首相為嘉　波根維爾島海空戰中之英雄將士及表示敬弔是役陣亡之英靈，特於十日電賀古實聯合艦隊司令官及以下之閣日艦隊司令，大意謂：頃獲波根維爾島第一次及第二次海空戰之捷報，不勝慶辛，幷對陣亡將士表示弔敬，且對獲得最後勝利之　旨益堅，茲於慶賀之餘，幷視閣下及各將士之式運長久，日衆議院亦於十日由　議長代表衆議院電賀古賀聯合艦隊司令，大意謂：日忠魚之海軍與航空部隊，此次於波根維爾海空戰中，攻撃敵大艦隊，獲得赫　戰果，扮碎敵方企圖，其功動實為巨大，全國民莫不深為感激、感激之餘，幷祝閣下及應下各將士勇健。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日大本營發表　第二此戰國 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日大本營十日下午三時發表，茲迫加第二次波根維爾烏海面空戰之戰果如次。：　擊沉戰艦一艘，（即前報重創之戰艦），　擊毀大地巡洋艦三戰（重創），巡洋艦或為大型驅逐艦一艘，　擊落飛機三架。　日軍損失自炸及未歸還之飛機五架。按第二次波根維爾島海面空戰之綜合戰果，迄今已判明者如次：擊沉敵戰船四艘，巡洋艦二艘，驅　艦三的，及運　船四。一沉敵大型巡洋艦六艘以上（重創），巡洋艦（或驅逐艦）四及大型運輸船一重創起火，　擊落敵機十五架，　日方扒害飛　自炸及未返某地老計二十架。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　綜合日大本營九，十兩日所發表第二次波根維爾島海面空戰之　合戰果，計日航空部隊撃沉敵戰艦四艘，洋巡艦二艘逐驅艦三艘，運輸船四艘及其他擊沉擊毀者總計二十四艘，復襲落敵機前後共十五架，日機亦損失五架，合計白炸及未歸還者共二卞架。日海軍機於八日在特羅基納角附近至波根維爾島南方海區城，對敵有力運輪船團及護衛艦隊加以强襲，經數次攻擊，收獲偉大戰果，此已如九日大本營第一次所發表。按是役日海軍機對敵之攻擊非常緊急，敵艦船或因重創，傾斜或起火焚燒，敵艦為圖　免日機之轟擊，拼命逃竄，但終未逃出日機之目標。日指揮官納富大計更首先向敵艦衝撞，繼之復有指揮官三名撞入廠艦隊中，樹立光榮之偉動，而壮烈殉國，於此日海軍機隊自指揮官以下，均抱見敵必殺，視死如歸之決心，以卓絕之技術，實行追擊戰。日海軍機此種偉大之傳統精神，於此益形昂拐矣。</p>
<h3 id="c4">日米內海軍大將　捷報發表感想　勗勉國民努力飛機增產 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日本前內閣總理大臣米內光政海軍大將，於觀到第二次波根維爾島海面空戰之大捷報後，談其惑想如次：此次戰果之大，殆為不能想信者，今對帝國海軍之威力，僅有驚嘆而已。航空部隊勇士，不顧汽油巳盡，一意滅敵，不期生還，其　行迫撃戰之鬥志，實即一死報國之帝國海軍魂耳。戰果之擴大，尙有堪可期待者，想全國民聞此消息，常無不罄消積，而由心底　聲快战，國民可絕對信賴我海軍，惟望國民勿因戰爭之變化而　無定，勿為　音所　，各護其職，此亦國民報答此偉大戰果之道。因我軍此次大勝，敵海軍內部必有動搖，其國民之信賴亦必因而　地，由其艦隊之編制而觀，此對於今後作戰影響亦必重大，前此敵方之反攻作戰，倘係以航空母艦為主。則其航空母艦亦已一沉沒或受電創。所謂跳島作戰，殆可為敵軍之惟一戰術，今一舉而被擊潰，實係敵軍一致命打擊，敵軍此種慘敗，余以為或即對我軍戰力認識錯誤所致，但吾人亦萬不可認為由此已制敵人於死命，故國民於歡慶之餘，尙須銘記「勝而勿」之戒營，望者國民進一步努力於後方之任務，尤其此大東亞會議出過，建設火東亞之方策已見確立之時，加以此次大戰果，國民倘稍有戰爭不久即將結來之感，則　為莫大之錯誤。蓋大東亞會議乃　開邁進於大束亞建設第一次歷史之會議，如何推進，尙待今後之努力，此次大戰果亦同此，僅係最後制英美於死命之前一階段，故望國民切勿興　過度，觀此次戰果，彼等之戰術與精神，已可看出天淵之別，此後之問題，僅係量之問題，關於此點，亦切望國民勿落敵國之後，積極努力於飛機之生產。</p>
<h3 id="c5">日第八十四次　通常議會　下月廿四日召集 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日政府為準備第八十四次通常議會之事務，決於二日四日兩日之閣議中，決定法律突及預算案之調警方法時期等，着着進行，對議會方策，茲於十日發表，十二月二十四日召集第八十四次通常議會。</p>
<p>軍事觀察家談海戰音　義</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　據此間軍事觀察家談：第二次波根維爾島海面空戰，日海軍航空部隊　沉或重創敵艦船共達二十九艘，實為珍珠灣作戰以來最大之戰果，據日大本營九·十兩日發表，更可知南太平洋方面戰况之激烈與戰局之重大。大東亞戰爭，由爭奪基地而進至海上主力決戰之階段，亦於此可以證明，蓋在此次海戰中，敵軍主力艦之損失即達四艘，亦可見敵艦隊之數不在少，良以主力艦在海軍中之地位，無異陸軍中之有力城池、足以決定海上戰鬥之命運，為海軍力之根幹，無論攻撃力，防禦力，均非其他艦　所能及。雖在此次大戰中，因軍用飛機之發達，海上戰術之變化，戰艦之地位，曾被認為應重加檢討，但其為海軍艦隊之主力地位並未稍變。在大東亞戰爭中，馬來海戰時，英戰艦威　斯親王號，及驅逐號之被日機炸沉，英東亞船隊即於此覆減，故此次波根維爾島海面航空戰中，美戰艦四　同時沉失，此在美國海軍力上打擊之大，應為開戰以來所未有者。至巡洋艦，驅逐艦等，較戰艦為小，但在今日之海上機空戰中，尤為不可或缺之根幹，此次敵美艦隊中，亦有五艘破擊沉，更可見敵人損失之慘重，是故此次空戰，不但為日軍獲得一大勝利，足以表示“軍對於敵軍之任何反擊乃至進攻，已有一隨時可以將其擊破之戰略態勢。日軍於此旣已拙　敵軍之反攻企圖，而影饗其未來者，可謂尤為巨大，蓋日軍旣將敵軍　範圍之戰略完全擊破，即今後日軍在戰局上，已取得內綫作戰之有利地位。因此，對於敵軍之擊，可隨時加以打撃，而敵軍於此，惟有再遭損失，故此次南太平洋方面之偉大戰果，及共有利之戰略態勢，　完遂大東亞戰爭中，實為我東亞人所應一致重視者。</p>
<p>敵船員損折數字　人</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日海軍航空隊，於僅十四日之　期間。已炸沉及擊沉敵艦船三十三艘，炸毀二十二至二十三艘·　立勝利紀錄，再推　敵　船員之喪失人數，炸沉之百人，巡洋估計每平均船員三百五十人，四艘計千四百人，大型驅逐艦船員佔計一百五十人，二　合計五百人，大型驅逐艦八千噸以上一，船員佔計八百人。二艘合計二千四百人，總計約七千一百人，均於一瞬間沉身海底。其次擊沉者戰艦一艘，船員佔計千六百人，四艘六千四百人，中　航空母艦約二千人，大型巡洋艦一艘，船員八百人，四艘三千二百人，巡洋艦船員三百五十人，大　　逐艦船員佔計一艘三百人，三艘九百人，驅逐艦一艘船員佔計二百人，四艘八百人，運輸船（五千噸）船員一　佔計五百人，四艘二千人，小　巡輪船（三千噸）船員佔　三百人，擊沉艦船之搭乘船員合計一萬五千九百五十人，其中半數由附近敵艦施救，但至少敵兵員死數約達七千九百七十五人。敵被炸沉及擊沉船艦搭乘員中總數常達一萬五千七十五人。且此項數字係以最少　準數計算者，賓際敵兵員之喪失，常遠駕此數字也。又　間敵機被擊　數量　四百四架以上，其搭乘員至少超過千名，故敵　員，　損耗，北軍大實在預料以上也。</p>
<h3 id="c6">日海軍雷襲機　建輝煌戰果　駕駛員表現高超技術 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日海軍雷擊機隊，自珍珠潛戰役以來，迄此次波根維爾島海面空戰，迭獲　煌戰果，日　永　海軍少將。現正著述　中海軍具有　特之雷擊戰術，駕駛員乃　其原問，　毅實行，其技術之高超，實居世界第一。實行　撃戰之適宜時間，為薄？及黎明，利用此時機，乃最為切要。如五日簿暮渡　維爾海面　　戰，日方僅出動海軍機十四架，而能擊沉敵航空母艦，巡洋艦等六艘，即利用此巧妙之　好機會所獲之戰果。在海軍戰中，得制敵於死命者，實以魚　艦第一，然日英美三國之空中　，乃起始於大正廿三年（民國，係命中　　三十五六發，並歷時四日始沉。而日海軍機隊擊沉遠較俾士麥號堅强，且　稱為不沉艦之威爾昕　王號時，僅為時二十分鐘，僅此即足以昭和二三年（民國十六七年）間，余曾與斯時尙爲大佐之故山本元帥同赴　洋艦及驅逐艦今減，而後前以我主力艦　（轟炸機隊一舉　　日軍僅存之戰艦羣。同時，並介紹　甚於上空猛訓練之俯衝轟炸機</p>
<p>全與山木大　常答稱：誠然誠然，但對於魚　之信念絲毫並末東　，　乃　織雷襲擊之猛訊練，如今彼等想已深知，請一觀世界之所有海戰，以魚雷軍賴擊　軍艦者，　非帝國海軍中　擊隊乎。</p>

<p>美議晨的非難</p>
<p>最近視察戰綫歸國的美國參議員五名，發表非難英國的言論，在英美關係上，引起軒然大波。英國報紙目前正對此論難起而　解。其中重要問題之一，是以武器租借法為中心的論爭。武器租借法使美國成為反軸心陣綫中事實上的兵工廠，以軍需品供給反軸心諸國，而規定何種確實的償還方法，這是此次大戰中美國遂行戰爭方策的一大特徵。從共制定時起，在美國議會中就遭遇反對而難產。反對論的中心說：「英國拿什麼，並用何種方法償還美國，以為代價呢」？美國對英援助，自然不取戰債的方法，從那意思上看來，政府的答辯，也極為曖昧，美國木身，直到參戰為止的時間中，那問題一直這樣含糊下去，以至今日。</p>
<p>英國一般人對此問題的情緒，大約如次：</p>
<p>「武器租借法是什麼」？「從美國拿東西來而不付錢的組織」。</p>
<p>「那麼：美國得到些什麼呢」？</p>
<p>「不是飛行基地嗎」？</p>
<p>租借法的運用</p>
<p>此次美國上參議員五名的對英論難，把這問題又舊學重提。而特別加以重視的緣故，乃因武器租借法是美國遂行戰爭最大的武器，同時，這裹又潛伏着英美利書關係最尖銳的對立。自從一九四一年三月十一日實施武器粗借法起至今年六月未為止，在議會上認為可支出的預算額計二百四士六億元，共中一百二士九億元業已消費。六月末，該法延長後，自七月以來至現在，每月約支出八倍至卞億元。</p>
<p>用武器租借法的國家數之後逐漸增加，現在超過四十四國以上。大部分的武器租借法中物資，當然運送到英國和蘇聯。據本年七月未羅斯福的發表，輪出總額百四十　中，五〇％是軍器，二一％是工業生產品，十四％食糧，一五％係船舶及其修繕費，並武器租借法物資生產工廠設備改善費等。但六月未止的對英輸出總額約四士俄元，對蘇輪出總額約二十億元，所以可知上述兵器，工業生產品，食糧的大部份是運到英蘇爾國的。每月十億元·約當美國全軍事生產的一五％，就各種兵器分別說來，每一百中，轟炸機十七架，戰門機二十五架，輕戰車二十二輕，重戰車三十輛，根據武器租借法而輸出至反軸心諸國。</p>
<p>英美各執一辭　　以上是從美國所見到的武器租借法運用之實際租受惠最多的英國，所受到租借物資的總額業已突破五士億元，英國對此支付了些什麼呢？不是現金，那是千眞萬確的，而百分之九十的英國人所意料中供給飛機根據地，也並未實行。美國恐怕國內非難，舉出下面數字為英國辯護。自去年六月至本年五月，英國對美國的軍際供給了一百三十六萬噸船噸位的軍需品及二百十七萬噸的資材。英國方面，自從此次美國參議員的對英非難成爲間題之後，也開始辯解，例如每日陲報說：「美國如其說那樣的話，則我們也有說話的份兒。」於是詳細列舉英國的對美債權，據此：「英國直到現在爲止，不要求用英國船雙運輪美國兵的船費，也不要求國內鐵道的運送費。這當然相當於武器租借法貸與物資的應付費用。同樣，美國船隻在世界各地的英屬港濟修繕並碇泊費，又美國方面所使用的電報，電話，電燈，伙食費等，以及二萬五千名英國市民為了在英國本土內的美國軍隊而工作的傳給費等，這些都未向美國要求分文。現在駐屯英本國的美國軍隊所需的食糧，本年最多，竟達四億磅，這雖道不同樣是對美的反對支付嗎，」</p>
<p>英國又把往美國輪入的物資偽裝為本國製品，秘密轉運他國，利用之以擴充本國的勢力。美國對此加非難，英國則提下列事實答稱：</p>
<p>去年十一月運至北非洲的牛乳，眞正地說來，不是為了收買原居民對英美登陸軍的人心嗎？且那雖是從美國運來的牛乳而由美國紅士字會分配，但事實上則是輸入英國的貯藏品。</p>
<p>英報強硬反駁</p>
<p>每日郵報用這種論調暴露一向很為秘密的兩國間內慕，以反駁美國。該報並列舉種種事實，例如：不僅英本國，澳洲，新西蘭，去年供給麥克沃羣軍的食糧達二億三千五百萬磅：英國供給蘇聯的戰車，飛機數和美國相等，加拿大也和美國一樣，根據本國的武器租借法，木國供給蘇聯及澳洲約二億五千萬金磅的物資，從人口的比例說來，那相常於美國所供給的士二倍。而共結論說任：何國家沒有可以規定對戰爭最有貢獻的確切標準。現金額等並不是最適合的標準。假定英國的飛行員，駕駛美國製造價值的八萬元的轟炸機，戰着四千元的國製炸彈，飛赴柏林轟炸，那麼英國的對美負債是八萬四千元。可是如其那飛行員戰死時，我們可要求多少金額呢？」</p>
<p>上面不過舉出了英國報紙憎厭美國最甚的例子而已，這　論調，雖有程度之差，似是支的空氣。武器租借借法本來是美國憋於前次大戰的戰債問題，在無法可想的情勢下，新想出來的援助反軸心國方法，在戰局激變的今日，也就達到了限界，英美二國的利害對立，以前一向韓飾着，現在因這問題而不能不鮮明地暴露了。這又恰和莫斯科三國會議上各種問題一時欲爆發的現象相共通的。翔（翔譯自士月二士八日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c55">決戰與日本民衆的覺悟　德富蘇峯本多態太郞富多對談 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>德富　中國問題現在時常提起。本多先生對於這問提有豐富的知識。關於中國的情形，水冬先生在中國做外交官從書記一直到大使，到現在為止的中國最近的歷史，先生會視身經歷過來。所以我想聽先生的高論。——近來時常有中國的文人到日本來，日本的文人也有到中國去，談起在思想上東方一致的問題。從中國來的人，作小說和新體詩的人似乎很多，而從此地去的人，也大抵是這種人。這種人們，對於什麼是東洋的思想，以何爲東洋的思想，還不十分清楚，所以是否有所謂東洋一致的根木，仔細考察起來，那難道不是曾語之外的事情嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c56">思想復古的必要 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>我先想同中國的同胞在精神上下一大警告。在中國，無論如河，思想的復古，今日最為必要。中國應復還於孔子之道。說到我自已的事情，甚為慚愧，我生於儒敎主義的家庭，我的父親以儒敎的學者而立於世，我自已也曾受家學。或詐是由於浮躁，年輕時說到儒敎就非常厭惡，我祗想到儒敎的壞的一方面。我的第一部著述就就嘲駡儒敎，似乎在明治十七年，我曾發表過一篇「自由道德及儒敎主義」，那書我曾印了三百部送人。那是說儒敎的非常無用，照一般說來，是攻擊日本的朱子學。此後時代變遷，幾歷六十年，在那期問，見到研究各種東四，也見到思考各種東西，以為儒敎在中國是不合於中國生活的東四，不過所謂儒者，不管是好是環，支配中國快近五子年了。如其說九千年太長，就四千年吧！總之，儒敎不但滴用於巾國，並也傳到日本。現在日本人所或的日常的倫理道德，大概和儒敎主義的精神形成一體。假使說到東洋的思想，則除此之外就沒有一政的思想。中日思想上的提擔·用這儒敎來提攜是最確實的方法吧！</p>
<h3 id="c57">儒敎主義的眞髓 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>孔夫子的精神，借後藤新平伯的話來說。就是「政治的倫理化」。如共能夠依此而行，自然很好。儒敎主義即從孔子以來，也已經過了二千餘年的經騐，那儒敎實和東洋人的性格風氣，趣味，思想，及一切生活上都巳打成一片，愛成骨，血，肉。正如日本之復返於神武天皇一樣，中國人不能不還到几夫子的道理，這是最必要的。中國如想趁此機會眞心的要在思想上有所改革，則必須在這裏而探求。</p>
<p>所謂通步者，不一定說新的事情忱是進步。回到從煎好的事物，也是一種迪步。正像以前的人身體很健全，至今日則漸　哀弱，所如其能回到以前一樣健全的身體，也忱是身體的進步·道情形完全一樣。然而我以為這非大大地振作一下不行。</p>
<p>我捫並不是說思想上，把孔子所說的，和宋子所著的，原封不動的完全採取。孺敎的精神，秩序是一種基本。說到東洋的思想，秩序最為必要。那秩序就是　敎的思想。儒敎上所說「禮」這個名詞，就是秩序。而儒敎中也有哲學。例如：</p>
<p>天地位焉。萬物育焉。</p>
<p>我們讀中席，裏而有很多哲學思想。從日常的倫理思想以人類所應做的完全說到了。中國人如不回到那裏，一切都是徒然的。木多先生大約也知遵得很詳細吧：即中國人富中的先賢先覺者，和特殊的人物，也非常洋細地知道中國的事情。</p>
<h3 id="c58">中國人不知中國事 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>例如和我們同時代的梁啟超，王國維等，就最清楚中國的事情。今日一般中國的政治家，就不大知道中國的事情。既不知歷史，又不懂文學，關於中國所知道的，大約祇有一點戲劇的知識吧：所謂關於中國的知城，他們沒有什麼可以給我們。不僅如此，應該從我們那裏接受的條養，共他一切等等，大多不具備。中國人有略為研究一點本國情事者，已經算是非當好的了。所以我以為說到思想上的一致、不是應該從這種地方閒始嗎？</p>
<p>這探漸轟進行，我以為大家就能互相敬愛，不過現在的所謂中國的文士，他們的思想如可，我不大明瞭。</p>
<h3 id="c59">緊咬牙關建樹勝利 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>本多　二十年前「革命尚未成功」這句話遞不是孫文的遺言，革命正在進行中，所以那時候中國的情形，正和明治士年時代，民權運動盛打時，為打倒藩閥的情形一樣。當時坡塡所領導的自由然，搬出福祿泰爾，處梭等所主張的天　人權說和國約憲法論，這種過波時代所有的一切現象，中國的朋友們，都曾搬演過。不過這也祗有在大東亞戰完遂後，在日木的指　下，更生為新的國家，效法我們脫離明治二、三十時歐美支配的時代面　於國思想，中國也應返於德富先生所說的儒敎精神，而具體表現於事物上。這樣說來，無論想樣吃苦，應時緊牙關，在大東亞戰上建樹光　的勝利：完）（翔：自十月二十二日西部軔日新</p>

<h3 id="e1">Emphasizing Facts, Offering Advice at the Economic Policy Liaison Conference <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industries yesterday commenced a three-day "Local Economic Policy Liaison Conference" in [location blank in original]. Attendees and discussants are economic officials from various provinces and municipalities in charge of local economics and related matters. The purpose of the conference, according to telegraphic reports, is to review the general situation of past local economic measures and to discuss matters related to the promotion of local economic measures in the future. In short, after a round of review and deliberation, it is hoped that economic measures will become more rational and realize the established national economic policy.</p>
<p>The economy of a country is like the blood of the human body. Blood must circulate for life to continue; the economy must be smooth for the national lifeline to survive. How to make the economy rational and smooth is not only to maintain the survival of the national lifeline, but also to seek the prosperity and strength of the nation. It is indeed the path that every country should strive to achieve diligently. The content of economic measures can be roughly divided into two parts: one is to determine economic policy, and the other is to implement economic policy. Determining economic policy is the responsibility of the highest economic authority of the country. Implementing economic policy is the responsibility of the economic authorities in various parts of the country, and it can also be said to be the common responsibility of all the people.</p>
<p>In our country, the body that determines economic policy is the National Economic Commission. In its first plenary meeting in February of this year, it has already determined the wartime economic policy outline. There are already guidelines for how to make the economy smooth. As for the implementation of economic policy, economic bureaus and other specialized agencies have been established in various provinces and cities. Judging from the goals of the economy and the implementing agencies, the scale can be said to be already in place. What remains is only the question of personnel and efforts in implementation. In reality, the determination of economic policies and the establishment of implementing agencies are certainly important, but the actual effectiveness of a smooth economy depends on whether the personnel are appropriate and the degree of effort. Because if the personnel are inappropriate and the efforts are insufficient, then the policies are no different from empty words, and the institutions are merely ornaments, which are not related to a smooth economy and a prosperous nation. Therefore, our overall view of the national economy emphasizes the perfection of policies and the strengthening of institutions, but the integrity of personnel and the diligence in implementation should not be ignored. Based on the above viewpoint, we, standing on the position of the people, have higher expectations for this conference held by the Ministry of Industries than for the previous meetings of the National Economic Commission. In particular, this conference regards the review of past facilities and the discussion of future liaison [blank in original] as equally important, which shows a practical style worthy of praise. We hope that the participating representatives will honestly report the difficulties in economic facilities and jointly discuss solutions. Achievements reported in the style of officialdom are largely unnecessary to list. Unrealistic proposals, rather than being empty and indecisive, should be saved time by not mentioning them. Here, we offer two suggestions for reference:</p>
<p>First, concerning the issue of increasing production, we certainly know that the issue has long been valued by the government, and according to the policy objectives, a promotion plan has been formulated and implemented step by step. However, what we are concerned with is the facts. We demand that the quantity of agricultural and industrial production indeed increase in the statistical figures, and we further demand that the supply of materials be smooth, prices be suppressed, and people's livelihoods be stabilized due to the increase in production. At the same time, increase the strength of external cooperation in the war.</p>
<p>The second is the issue of prices, which also seems to have long been valued and implemented by the authorities. However, similarly, we must see the facts. How to comprehensively limit prices and how to eliminate national accumulation should be achieved with consistent methods.</p>
<p>The scope of the economy is extremely broad, and it is certainly not possible for the Ministry of Industries to completely solve all problems within its powers. However, if the Ministry of Industries can fully exert its effectiveness in undertakings within its jurisdiction and set an example, then other relevant economic departments will naturally be invigorated. May the authorities of the Ministry of Industries and the gentlemen attending the conference work together to achieve this.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo, to commend the heroic soldiers in the naval and air battle of Bougainville Island and express respect and condolences to the heroic spirits who died in the battle, sent a telegram to Commander Koga of the Combined Fleet and the commanders of the Japanese Fleet on the 10th, saying: "I am very pleased to hear the news of the victory in the first and second naval and air battles of Bougainville Island. I express my condolences and respect to the soldiers who died in battle, and I am determined to win the final victory. In addition to congratulating you, I wish you and all the soldiers good health." The House of Representatives also sent a telegram of congratulations from Speaker [Okada] on the 10th on behalf of the House of Representatives to Commander Koga of the Combined Fleet, saying: "The naval and air forces of Japan, with loyalty, attacked the enemy's large fleet in the naval and air battle of Bougainville, achieving brilliant results and thwarting the enemy's intentions. The contribution is truly great, and all the people are deeply grateful. In addition to gratitude, I wish you and all the soldiers good health."</p>
<h3 id="e3">Announcement by the Japanese Headquarters: The Second Battle Result <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 10th that the results of the second naval and air battle off Bougainville Island are as follows: Sunk one battleship (i.e., the battleship reported earlier as heavily damaged); Damaged three large cruisers (heavily damaged), one cruiser or large destroyer; Shot down three aircraft. The Japanese army lost five aircraft due to self-explosion and failure to return. According to the combined results of the second naval and air battle off Bougainville Island, the following has been confirmed so far: Sunk four enemy battleships, two cruisers, three destroyers, and four transport ships. Six or more enemy large cruisers sunk (heavily damaged), four cruisers (or destroyers) and one large transport ship heavily damaged and on fire; Fifteen enemy aircraft shot down. The Japanese side damaged [illegible] aircraft, self-explosion and failure to return, a total of twenty.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to the combined results of the second naval and air battle off Bougainville Island announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 9th and 10th, the Japanese air force sank four enemy battleships, two cruisers, three destroyers, and four transport ships, and other ships sunk or destroyed totaled twenty-four. Fifteen enemy aircraft were shot down before and after, and five Japanese aircraft were also lost. A total of twenty were self-exploded and failed to return. On the 8th, Japanese naval aircraft launched a strong attack on enemy transport fleets and escort fleets near Torokina Point to the southern sea area of Bougainville Island. After several attacks, great results were achieved, as announced by the General Headquarters for the first time on the 9th. According to the report, the Japanese naval aircraft's attack on the enemy was very urgent. Enemy ships were either severely damaged, tilted, or set on fire. Enemy ships desperately fled to avoid the bombing of Japanese aircraft, but ultimately did not escape the target of Japanese aircraft. Japanese Commander Natomi first collided with an enemy ship, followed by three commanders who rammed into the fleet, establishing a glorious achievement and sacrificing heroically. Here, the Japanese naval aircraft team, from the commander down, all had the determination to kill the enemy and regard death as home, and implemented the pursuit battle with superb technology. This great traditional spirit of the Japanese naval aircraft is even more uplifting here.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Admiral Yonai on the Great Victory: Expressing Thoughts and Encouraging National Efforts to Increase Aircraft Production <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - After hearing the news of the great victory in the second naval and air battle off Bougainville Island, former Prime Minister and Admiral of the Navy Mitsumasa Yonai talked about his thoughts as follows: The magnitude of this battle result is almost unbelievable. Now I can only marvel at the power of the Imperial Navy. The brave air force warriors, disregarding that their gasoline was exhausted, were determined to destroy the enemy and did not expect to return alive. Their fighting spirit of carrying out a forced attack is truly the soul of the Imperial Navy that repays the country with death. The expansion of the battle results is still worth looking forward to. I think that the people of the whole country will be exhausted and express their joy from the bottom of their hearts when they hear this news. The people can absolutely trust our navy, but I hope that the people will not be unsettled by the changes in the war, do not [illegible] by the [illegible], and each protect their duties. This is also the way for the people to repay this great victory. Because of our army's great victory this time, there must be a shaking inside the enemy's navy, and the trust of its people will also be lost. Judging from the organization of its fleet, this will also have a major impact on future operations. Previously, the enemy's counter-offensive operations were mainly based on aircraft carriers, then its aircraft carriers have also sunk or suffered electric damage. The so-called island-hopping operations can be said to be the enemy's only tactic, but now it has been defeated in one fell swoop, which is a fatal blow to the enemy. The enemy's miserable defeat this time, I think, may be due to a wrong understanding of our military strength, but we must never think that we have taken the enemy's life because of this. Therefore, in addition to celebrating, the people must also remember the warning of "Do not [illegible] in victory". I hope that the people will further work hard on the tasks in the rear, especially when the Great East Asia Conference has passed and the strategy for building East Asia has been established. If the people have a feeling that the war will end soon, then it is a great mistake. The Great East Asia Conference is a conference that has just embarked on the first historical meeting of the construction of East Asia. How to promote it still depends on future efforts. This great battle result is the same, it is only a stage before finally defeating Britain and the United States. Therefore, I hope that the people will not be overly excited. Looking at this battle result, the difference between their tactics and spirit can already be seen. The problem from now on is only the problem of quantity. Regarding this point, I also hope that the people will not lag behind the enemy and actively work hard on the production of aircraft.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - In order to prepare for the affairs of the 84th Ordinary Session of the Diet, the Japanese government decided to proceed with the method of adjusting laws and the budget bill in the cabinet meetings on the 2nd and 4th. Regarding the Diet's policy, it was announced on the 10th that the 84th Ordinary Session of the Diet will be convened on December 24th.</p>
<p>Military Observers Discuss the Meaning of the Naval Battle</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to military observers here, the Japanese naval air force sank or heavily damaged a total of 29 enemy ships in the second naval and air battle off Bougainville Island, which is the largest battle result since the Pearl Harbor operation. According to the announcements by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 9th and 10th, it can be seen that the war in the South Pacific is fierce and the war situation is significant. The Great East Asia War, from the contention for bases to the stage of decisive naval battles, can also be proven here. In this naval battle, the loss of the enemy's main battleships reached four, which also shows that the number of enemy fleets is not small. The position of the main battleship in the navy is no different from the powerful city in the army, which is enough to determine the fate of the naval battle and is the foundation of naval power. Whether it is attack power or defense power, it cannot be compared with other ships. Although in this war, due to the development of military aircraft and changes in naval tactics, the status of battleships has been considered to be re-examined, but its position as the main force of the naval fleet has not changed slightly. In the Great East Asia War, during the Battle of Malaya, the British battleship Prince of Wales and the destroyer were sunk by Japanese aircraft, and the British East Asia fleet was reduced. Therefore, in the naval air battle off Bougainville Island, four American battleships were sunk at the same time, which should be the largest blow to the United States naval power since the start of the war. Cruisers, destroyers, etc. are smaller than battleships, but in today's naval and air battles, they are indispensable foundations. Five enemy American fleets were also broken and sunk in this battle, which shows the enemy's heavy losses. Therefore, this air battle is not only a great victory for the Japanese army, but also enough to show that the "army has a strategic posture that can defeat any counterattack or even attack by the enemy at any time." The Japanese army has already defeated the enemy's counter-offensive attempts, and the impact on its future can be said to be even greater. Since the Japanese army has completely defeated the enemy's strategic [illegible], the Japanese army has gained an advantageous position in the war. Therefore, the enemy can be attacked at any time, and the enemy can only suffer losses again. Therefore, the great battle results in the South Pacific and the advantageous strategic situation should be emphasized by all East Asians in order to complete the Great East Asia War.</p>
<p>Enemy Ship Crew Loss Figures [Illegible] People</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese naval air force, in a [illegible] period of only 14 days. Has bombed and sunk 33 enemy ships, destroyed 22 to 23 ships [illegible] victory record, and then estimate the number of enemy [illegible] crew members lost. The sunk hundred people, the cruiser is estimated to have an average of 350 crew members, four ships totaling 1,400 people, large destroyer crew members are estimated at 150 people, two [illegible] totaling 500 people, large destroyers of 8,000 tons or more [illegible], crew members are estimated at 800 people, two ships totaling 2,400 people, totaling about 7,100 people, all sank to the bottom of the sea in an instant. The next sunk battleship, crew members are estimated at 1,600 people, four ships totaling 6,400 people, medium [illegible] aircraft carrier about 2,000 people, large cruiser one ship, crew members 800 people, four ships totaling 3,200 people, cruiser crew members 350 people, large [illegible] destroyer crew members are estimated at 300 per ship, three ships totaling 900 people, destroyer one ship, crew members are estimated at 200 people, four ships totaling 800 people, transport ship (5,000 tons) crew members are estimated [illegible] 500 people per ship, four ships totaling 2,000 people, small [illegible] cruiser (3,000 tons) crew members are estimated [illegible] 300 people. The total number of crew members on the sunk ships totaled 15,950 people, half of whom were rescued by nearby enemy ships, but at least the number of enemy soldiers killed reached about 7,975 people.

Secondly, the war stage is becoming more and more tense, and economic policy is becoming more and more important. In order to make the control effective, it is necessary for the central government and local governments to have close contact, and for local governments to have mutual contact. Especially since the situations in various places are different, it is necessary to discuss whether a law stipulated by the central government can be implemented in various places and whether there are obstacles. This is the first point of significance of convening this meeting. In addition, whether it is vertical or horizontal, close contact is necessary. Starting from today, I hope that based on this spirit, we will continue to study economic policies and work together to promote them.

<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in Central China states that Japanese forces, attacking the routed 66th and 79th Armies, advanced rapidly towards the Bashan Mountains. On the morning of the 6th, they forced a major battle against the main force of the Chongqing 66th Army in the area of Niejiache (22 kilometers southwest of Yidu) and Zhujiaqiao (25 kilometers south of Yidu), initiating a large-scale annihilation operation. Another Japanese unit encircled the main force of the routed 76th Army in the area of Taiqingshan, Heshangdong, and Xinmenshi (south of Xijia). Since the evening of the 8th, the fighting has been extremely fierce. These units, in coordination with Japanese forces south of the Yangtze River, infiltrated Fangjiang, the stronghold of the Chongqing 66th Army's 185th Division, at dusk on the 7th and completely occupied it.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in Central China, a certain unit of the Japanese army, after attacking Mojiawangjia Factory, Nuanshui Street, and Liujiachang, continued to fiercely pursue the routed Chongqing 79th Army, advancing rapidly towards the Bashan area. Furthermore, the Chongqing 194th Division and the 4th Regiment of the Provisional 6th Division, numbering approximately 4,000 men, fortified themselves in the dangerous terrain near Bawangmiao, 4 kilometers southwest of Wangjia Factory, and resisted stubbornly. Japanese units launched a night attack on the 6th and finally occupied the mountain at 6:00 AM on the 8th, continuing the fierce pursuit. On the evening of the 8th, they broke into Heshangdong and occupied it. Moreover, a certain suicide squad seized Bawangmiao and immediately pursued the main force of the Chongqing 89th Division and 194th Division to the south. At 6:30 PM on the 8th, they occupied Fang Xinmenshi (13 kilometers southwest of Wangjia Factory) and Tongzixi (28 kilometers southwest of Zhujia Factory), further pressing and defeating the remaining Chongqing troops as they fled rapidly in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Sun Lianzhong's Troops Repeatedly Collapse</p>
<p>Central China Frontline, 10th (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army launched its offensive in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the more than 40 divisions under Sun Lianzhong of the Chongqing Sixth War Area have actively attempted to restore their combat strength by undertaking replenishment preparations and strengthening their defenses. However, due to repeated defeats, their combat strength has become extremely weak and impossible to restore. Therefore, when the Japanese army initiated its offensive this time, the Chongqing 29th Army Group, the 44th Army, the 14th Army Group, the 79th Army, and the 66th Army, with a total force of 65,000 men, were on the verge of annihilation. Sun Lianzhong's attempts to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the anti-Axis forces' counter-offensive against Japan and the coordinated operations in Burma to launch an offensive in Central China have now become a pipe dream.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu recently met with a group of reporters to discuss his impressions of the Greater East Asia Conference, as follows: "The fact that the heads of state of various countries voluntarily participated in this conference, expressed their opinions passionately in the discussions, and successfully resolved various matters is the most profound impression I have. The Five Principles of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration can be described as an international policy that transcends ancient and modern, East and West. Based on these principles, we can know that a bright future will surely come to the countries of Greater East Asia. None of the Five Principles of the Declaration contains any self-serving, exclusive, or exclusionary nature. Each respects the other, and seeks harmony among the nations of East Asia. This has become the common spirit of all the representatives. The representatives of Greater East Asia all agree with these principles, and it is by no means just a slogan, but the faith of the Japanese people. The representatives must have deeply understood from Japan's words and deeds that the speeches of the Japanese Prime Minister and members of parliament in the Diet and other statements are completely consistent. Japan's Greater East Asia policy comes from the sincere heart of the nation. Furthermore, the participants of the conference all believe that (the Greater East Asia War) is not only a war for the survival of Japan, but also a war for the survival of the countries of Greater East Asia. This point is even stronger in other countries than in Japan, so they cannot but share life and death with Japan and cooperate to complete this great war. One representative said that in this Greater East Asia policy, he has already seen the bright future for himself. They said that this Greater East Asia War is a "war of liberation for Asia," or a "war of freedom for East Asia," or a "war of independence for Asia." If this war fails, not only will their independence not be guaranteed, but their suffering will be greater than before. All the representatives of Greater East Asia believe that the enemy's war aim is to oppress the nations of Greater East Asia and seize colonies. The war aim of Greater East Asia, however, is to implement a great principle that runs through ancient and modern, East and West. Therefore, with this spirit, the Greater East Asia War will surely be won. This conference opened with this kind of spirit, so its future is indeed worthy of anticipation. The Greater East Asia Policy is neither an exclusionary policy like the Monroe Doctrine, nor a hypocritical measure like the Atlantic Charter. The representatives of all countries believe that the Five Principles of Greater East Asia are the great principles for establishing world peace. I truly share this feeling, and in order to fully realize the achievements of this conference, we must all work hard and move forward together."</p>

<h3 id="e21">Chongqing Promulgates New Conscription Law <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from Chongqing, the difficulty of replenishing troops in the Chongqing army is becoming increasingly serious. It is reported that the Chongqing Ministry of Military Affairs promulgated a new conscription law on October 25th as a countermeasure to actively replenish troops. According to the new conscription law, all young men aged 20 are subject to conscription. However, the implementing regulations further stipulate that, in order to respond to emergencies, the age of conscription will be lowered to 19 as a first step. If the number of recruits is still insufficient, a second measure will be implemented to raise the age of conscription to 25. It seems that Chongqing's intention is to conscript all non-disabled persons regardless of age. In addition, guerrilla units and miscellaneous troops will be reorganized in an effort to assemble the number of regular troops. At the same time, joint responsibility will be strengthened, and all soldiers in a unit where a deserter occurs will be severely punished in order to prevent desertion. However, it seems that Chongqing's desperate measures will ultimately fail.</p>
<h3 id="e22">German Counteroffensive in Nevel, Fierce Fighting in the Entire Kyiv Area <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: The Soviet army has created a new center of effort north and northwest of Nevel, so the autumn battle on the Eastern Front is increasing in scale. The current fighting in the Nevel area is clearly related to the fighting in the Kyiv area, and the Soviet intent is obvious. The Soviets believe that it is of great importance to eliminate the threat to the development of their offensive caused by the interlocking of German forces in the central and northern sectors. During the battle for Kyiv, the Soviet army also launched intense offensives in the Nirol area. The German army was extremely resilient in both defense and counterattack. The German counteroffensive south of Nevel was victorious, thereby removing the threat to the west and north sides of the city and completely improving its positions in the area. Due to the marshy terrain, the positions of the enemy and friendly forces are so intertwined that it is difficult to discern their approximate lines. Although the Soviet army has continuously reinforced, it has made no significant progress west and northeast of Nevel, and is obstructed by the firm German iron wall, frequently suffering heavy losses and retreating. The German resistance is more tenacious than before, and the Soviet army must pay a great price. The Soviet army's efforts to push back the Germans to the west and south have failed, but it cannot yet be said that the Germans have suddenly changed the strategy they have adopted for this year's campaign. On Sunday, the Soviet army's attack on Crimea was still unsuccessful, and the German command has not abandoned this important Black Sea base.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to Havas, London dispatch 1: British Prime Minister Churchill, in a speech at the inauguration of the new Lord Mayor of London, Smith, warned the people not to be complacent, saying that the war in 1944 would be even greater than the Battle of Gettysburg, and British and American soldiers would have to make great sacrifices. Currently, many people mistakenly believe that the war is about to end, and the current environment does not allow for neglecting precautions. Germany currently has 400 divisions, and the danger has not diminished. If the Allied forces do not make any major strategic mistakes, the war in 1944 can be brought to an end. But in any case, the Allied forces must not base their strategy on the assumption that Germany is about to collapse. He went on to say that the air offensive against Germany is the greatest military effort by the Allied forces against Germany, and that the German bombing of Britain will also have a significant effect on the domestic front, and that the enemy air force may launch new forms of bombing at any time. On the political front, he hopes to meet with Roosevelt and Stalin in the future, and Foreign Secretary Eden will return from Cairo within the next week.

<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – On the 9th, the German military authorities announced the situation on the Italian front: "The battle on the Italian front is actually a war of attrition. German units are retreating to new defensive lines using organized delaying tactics. The specifics of these new defensive lines, which are the main line of German resistance, cannot be disclosed." It has been two weeks since the Italian front entered a state of attrition, and the current situation is as follows: 1. The British Eighth Army, which has the greatest numerical advantage, is currently engaged with the German left flank defense forces on the eastern front, and the fighting is approaching the Sangro River. 2. The second battlefield is in the upper reaches of the Calchaio River, namely the area from the bend of the river to the road of Venafro-Rotonda-Cassino and the Isernia area. Recently, the anti-Axis forces have mobilized a large force in that area in an attempt to break through, but they have been crushed by the German army. 3. The third battlefield is from Croche to the Tyrrhenian coast. Recently, the fighting in this area has intensified, but the general situation has not changed.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Weapon Lend-Lease Act and the Ugly Disputes Between Britain and America <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>A Morning of American Congressional Criticism</p>
<p>Recently, five U.S. senators who inspected the front lines and returned home made speeches criticizing Britain, causing a great uproar in Anglo-American relations. British newspapers are currently rising to defend themselves against this criticism. One of the important issues is the controversy centered on the Weapon Lend-Lease Act. The Weapon Lend-Lease Act made the United States the de facto arsenal of the anti-Axis front, supplying the anti-Axis countries with military supplies, and stipulating what kind of reliable method of compensation. This is a major feature of the U.S. war policy in this war. From the time it was formulated, it encountered opposition in the U.S. Congress and was difficult to produce. The center of the opposition argument said: "What will Britain take, and what method will it use to compensate the United States as a price?" U.S. aid to Britain naturally did not take the method of war debts. From that point of view, the government's answer was also extremely ambiguous. The problem remained vague until the United States entered the war, and it remains so to this day.</p>
<p>The general British sentiment on this issue is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>"What is the Weapon Lend-Lease Act?" "An organization that takes things from the United States without paying."</p>
<p>"So: What does the United States get?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it the air base?"</p>
<p>The Application of the Lend-Lease Act</p>
<p>This time, the criticism of Britain by the five U.S. senators raised this issue again. The reason why it is particularly emphasized is that the Weapon Lend-Lease Act is the biggest weapon for the United States to carry out the war. At the same time, the most acute opposition between British and American interests is lurking here. Since the implementation of the Weapon Lend-Lease Act on March 11, 1941, until the end of June this year, the budget amount considered expendable in the Congress was 24.6 billion yuan, of which 12.9 billion yuan has been spent. After the extension of the law at the end of June, approximately 800 million to 1 billion yuan is spent every month from July to the present.</p>
<p>The number of countries using the Weapon Lend-Lease Act has gradually increased, and now exceeds 44 countries. Most of the materials in the Weapon Lend-Lease Act are of course transported to Britain and the Soviet Union. According to Roosevelt's announcement at the end of July this year, among the total output of 14 billion, 50% are military equipment, 21% are industrial products, 14% are food, and 15% are ships and their repair costs, and equipment improvement costs for factories producing Weapon Lend-Lease Act materials. However, the total exports to Britain at the end of June were about 4 billion yuan, and the total exports to the Soviet Union were about 2 billion yuan. Therefore, it can be seen that most of the above-mentioned weapons, industrial products, and food were transported to Britain and the Soviet Union. 1 billion yuan per month accounts for about 15% of the total U.S. military production. Speaking of various weapons separately, for every 100, 17 are bombers, 25 are fighter jets, 22 are light tanks, and 30 are heavy tanks, which are exported to the anti-Axis countries according to the Weapon Lend-Lease Act.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Each Have Their Own Views　　The above is the actual application of the Weapon Lend-Lease Act seen from the United States. Britain, which has benefited the most from the lease, has received a total of more than 5 billion yuan of leased materials. What did Britain pay for this? It is absolutely certain that it is not cash, and 90% of the British people expected to provide air bases, but it did not happen. The United States, fearing domestic criticism, cited the following figures to defend Britain. From June last year to May this year, Britain supplied 1.36 million tons of military supplies and 2.17 million tons of materials to the U.S. military. The British side also began to defend themselves after the criticism of Britain by the U.S. senators became an issue. For example, the Daily Mail said: "If the United States says that, then we also have a say." Therefore, it detailed the British claims against the United States. According to this: "Until now, Britain does not require the shipping costs of British ships to transport U.S. troops, nor does it require domestic railway transportation costs. This is of course equivalent to the payable expenses for the materials lent by the Weapon Lend-Lease Act. Similarly, U.S. ships in British-owned ports around the world pay repair and mooring fees, as well as the telegrams, telephones, lights, food expenses, etc. used by the U.S. side, as well as the fees for 25,000 British citizens working for the U.S. military in the British mainland, none of which have been claimed from the United States. The food needed by the U.S. military stationed in Britain this year, at most, has reached 400 million pounds. Isn't this also a counter-payment to the United States?"</p>
<p>Britain also disguised the materials imported into the United States as domestic products and secretly transferred them to other countries, using them to expand its own power. The United States criticized this, and Britain responded by mentioning the following facts:</p>
<p>The milk transported to North Africa in November last year, isn't it really to buy the hearts of the natives to the Anglo-American landing forces? And although it was milk transported from the United States and distributed by the American Red Cross, it was actually imported into British reserves.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Strongly Refute</p>
<p>The Daily Mail used this argument to expose the inside story between the two countries, which has always been very secret, to refute the United States. The newspaper also listed various facts, such as: not only Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, last year supplied the MacArthur army with 235 million pounds of food: the number of tanks and aircraft supplied by Britain to the Soviet Union is equal to that of the United States, and Canada is the same as the United States. According to its own Weapon Lend-Lease Act, it supplies the Soviet Union and Australia with about 250 million gold pounds of materials, which is equivalent to twelve times what the United States supplies in terms of population ratio. And the conclusion says: No country has a precise standard that can determine the most contribution to the war. Cash, etc., is not the most suitable standard. Assuming that a British pilot drives a U.S.-made bomber worth 80,000 yuan, fighting with 4,000 yuan of domestic-made bombs, and flies to Berlin to bomb, then the British debt to the United States is 84,000 yuan. But if that pilot dies in battle, how much can we ask for?"</p>
<p>The above is just an example of the British newspapers' most hatred of the United States. This argument, although there are differences in degree, seems to be the atmosphere of support. The Weapon Lend-Lease Act was originally a method of assisting the anti-Axis countries that the United States came up with in the situation where it was impossible to think of a solution to the war debt problem of the previous war. In today's drastic changes in the war situation, it has reached its limit. The opposition of interests between Britain and the United States, which was always embellished in the past, is now inevitably and clearly exposed due to this problem. This is also in common with the phenomenon that various problems at the Moscow Three-Power Conference are about to explode at any time.

He especially recognized the daily necessities and tributes, such as chemical resin substitutes, Taike hot water pots, etc. After Mayor Lian's visit, a reporter from Shenyang News Agency asked about his feelings about the visit. He published the following: "I am very interested in this visit. In terms of art, I am especially interested in arts and crafts. Personal spectrum can express cultural code ideas. For other departments, I have two points to think about: Many of the daily necessities on display are substitutes, such as chemical resins for water and iron. In small countries, it is said that the people are responding quickly to material and emergency authority models. Tools are used as decorations, and the utensils of porcelain are not separated from the group, but lack artistry. They should be harmonized with each other. For example, the folk utensils of the Japanese state are often made with righteousness. I hope that Chinese folk artists will follow suit."</p>

<h3 id="e35">A Large Quantity of Coal Catty Will Be Shipped to Shanghai in the Short Term, and the Reduced Production of Coal Balls is Worth Noting <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>News Revealed by Foreign Huggers: The authorities in charge of this city are keenly aware that the shortage of coal catty is closely related to the revival of industry and commerce. Therefore, they are making great efforts to smooth out the source of coal catty. After active progress, it is heard that a large spring of coal catty has been wired to Wei Jiao, and it can be expected that it will be transferred to this place for sale within the teaching period. At that time, the authorities will still fairly assign each legitimate user to avoid being artificially inflated and illegally raising market prices.</p>
<p>Coal Distribution to Users Has Not Been Interrupted</p>
<p>Shanghai Reporters Zuo Zong learned that the number of fish and white coal catties stored in this city is more difficult than the small amount of shouting that was used two or three months ago, but all the existing stocks are still enough for the needs of the entire city for about two months. Therefore, the coal distribution to users has not been interrupted. However, the reason why the amount of this investment has gradually decreased is due to the obstruction of the tour, not because the product is less from Yingdi. Today, the authorities in charge of the ant transport meal have actively tried to change the maintenance. Because it is a large spring of coal, the transport Zhao Ping can be expected.</p>
<p>The Supply of Coal Beads Should Be Restored Immediately</p>

All coal ball manufacturers should be aware of the difficulties of the times and continue production to meet the needs of the citizens. However, because the supply of coal balls has not yet been fully restored, residents are looking for other secret fuel alternatives, resulting in soaring market prices for charcoal, firewood, and urban coal, which has a great impact on the city's expenses.</p>

<p>Economic Review</p>
<h3 id="e45">Increased Production Requires Avoiding Bankruptcy First <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Increased production requires avoiding bankruptcy first. This is a prerequisite for every sector of local products and foreign trade, especially for agricultural production. For thousands of years, China has relied on agriculture, and its agricultural productivity is as strong as the farmers. However, this most powerful productive force is also struggling at the lowest standard of living today. Speaking of the foundation of productive forces, as this newspaper previously commented, "Due to the impact of the ongoing war, our farmers are not only exhausted but also on the verge of collapse. Therefore, the production of agricultural products is also declining year by year." Therefore, revitalizing the impoverished rural areas is the key to increasing both industrial and agricultural production in China.</p>
<p>However, revitalizing China's rural areas, which encompass the "vast majority of the people," is by no means an easy task. On one hand, it requires the government to gather collective wisdom to develop detailed plans for rural revitalization. On the other hand, it also requires the people to pool their strength to implement detailed rural policies.</p>
<p>In recent years, rural loans have been much talked about. Since the Bank of Communications was ordered to handle agricultural loans, it has issued tens of millions of yuan in rural loans. Moreover, it is cooperating with the local banks in this city. The Zhejiang-Shanghai banking industry is also planning, under the supervision of the Central Government's business department and the guidance of the Central Reserve Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks, to establish an agricultural banking consortium in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, to facilitate the granting of rural loans. This shows that the need to avoid bankruptcy before increasing production has become a key point of public recognition.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Central China to Establish Raw Hide Purchasing Company; Purchasing Cooperatives Already Established <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the establishment of an organization to centrally purchase leather (raw hides) within the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, both Chinese and Japanese parties are actively preparing. According to this newspaper's reporter from the business community, this new centralized leather organization has been confirmed to be jointly operated by Chinese and Japanese parties, with a planned capital of ten million yuan, and is proposed to be named "Raw Hide Purchasing Company." It is expected to be formally established in the near future. However, the internal organizational system has not yet been finalized. Furthermore, according to information obtained by this reporter from leather merchants, the area with the highest leather production (mainly cattle hides) in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces of Central China is Bengbu, followed by Wuhu, and then Ningbo. The production volume in other areas is very small. The purchasing organization in Bengbu was established at the end of last month and is named "Bengbu Raw Hide Purchasing Cooperative." The similar cooperative in Wuhu will also be established soon. Furthermore, the purchasing cooperative in eastern Zhejiang has also been completed in Ningbo.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Stock Exchange Regulations; Duties of the Supervisory Committee <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Since the reopening of the Chinese Stock Exchange on the 8th, trading in the market has gradually returned to normal. Most brokers have installed telephones. Only a very small number of brokers have delayed the reopening date due to telephone installation problems. It is understood that the relevant authorities are deeply concerned about the reopening of the stock exchange, so the Supervisory Committee of the Stock Exchange was established early on, and the Organizational Rules of the Supervisory Committee were promulgated, with the aim of closely supervising all business operations of the stock exchange. The main points are summarized below: The Supervisory Committee may conduct random inspections of all account books and other documents related to the business operations of brokers in the exchange, to determine whether there are any violations of laws or regulations in their business activities. Brokers in the exchange must absolutely obey the orders or inquiries of the Supervisory Committee, and those who deliberately delay or refuse to comply will be reported to the relevant authorities by the Supervisory Committee for disciplinary action. If the Supervisory Committee discovers any falsification or illegal activities in the exchange's business accounts or business operations, it may immediately report the matter to the relevant financial authorities. The Supervisory Committee will submit a monthly work report to the Ministry of Finance by the 10th of each month, reporting the business operations of the exchange, the market conditions, and various related tables and records. Public officials are not allowed to participate in buying or selling on the exchange. Violators will be subject to disciplinary action for dereliction of duty.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Free Movement of Leather Goods within Three Provinces <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Leather Industry Association previously reported that the transportation of leather goods by its affiliated associations along the way has been met with difficulties, and that the shipping companies, not knowing the truth, have refused to transport them, affecting business. The association then turned to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for assistance. According to this reporter's investigation, leather goods are major commodities, but according to the "Provisional Regulations on the Control of Wartime Material Movement," the import and export of goods within the Shanghai area does not require the approval of the Chamber of Commerce, and the free movement is allowed within the three provinces. The Chamber of Commerce has already instructed the governments of each province and city to order the police departments to notify all inspection stations in their respective jurisdictions, to facilitate the transportation of goods.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee, because the public treasury certificates used by the basic members of the committee were still in silver currency, due to practical needs, the committee distributed them to various banks for subscription. They were changed to Central Reserve Certificates at face value, and the number of certificates to be subscribed was determined by the committee. Guarantee deposits were required. The committee has already begun issuing them separately. Regarding the discount interest for public bonds, the standing committee of the committee has set it at eight jiao per thousand yuan per day, which is one jiao less than the interbank lending rate of five jiao per day.</p>

<p>Industrial and Commercial Visit</p>
<h3 id="e54">Wing On Real Estate Co., Ltd. <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The latent real estate industry has been flourishing, and the turnover has been increasing. The most important reason for the prosperity of the real estate industry is that the price increase since the war has been the most frequent, and most investors are also paying attention to the security of real estate after the end of the war. This is a visit to Wing On Real Estate Company, a large-scale company in the industry. The details of the visit are as follows:</p>
<p>Wing On Real Estate Company was established on August 7, 1942, with the business scope of real estate investment, real estate mortgage, real estate leasing, real estate trading and mortgage agency, construction, design, construction supervision, and property valuation. The chairman of the board is Chen Renlan, and the supervisors are Zhu Bo Lai, Chou Tianxing, Jin Zongxu Cheng, Ye Fu Hai, Zhu Ru Tang, etc. The company's original capital was 1.5 million yuan, which was increased by 8.5 million yuan at the shareholders' extraordinary meeting on February 14 of this year, making the total capital of 10 million yuan. All of the investment has been made in real estate, and most of it is in immovable property. According to the detailed valuation of the construction experts, it has already exceeded the original amount of capital by 34 cents. The company's natural appreciation of assets is about 8-9 times. The business income for the current fiscal year is expected to be between 1.2 million yuan and 1.5 million yuan, which is a new profit in addition to the natural appreciation of the above-mentioned assets. As for the company's properties, in addition to the 24 mu of land at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Guangdong Road and Lailin Road, which are built with a large number of four-style houses, residences, and stockpiles, the Wing On Warehouse (i.e., the military expansion of the treasury) is one of the main assets, which can generate a surplus of about 500,000 yuan per year. The construction of the warehouse was completed in 1933. It is located at the corner of Geshu Xiao Road and Huimin Road (formerly Pei Ying'er Road), facing the Huangpu River, and can be reached from Yih Road (formerly Yih Road). It is a neighbor of the Huishan Wharf, with a total area of ​​9.81 acres. It is divided into two parts: the Yangshupu part is a six-story steel-framed building with three water-powered buildings. The Huimin Road part is a four-story building, with a total of 60 warehouse rooms, with a total area of ​​300,000 square meters and a total stacking volume of 4.3 million cubic meters. The internal equipment has two large elevators and three medium-sized duck elevators, which are known as the most modern in the world.</p>

<h3 id="e55">The Decisive Battle and the Awakening of the Japanese People: A Dialogue between Tokutomi Sohō, Honda Tatatarō, and Tomita <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Tokutomi: The China problem is often raised now. Mr. Honda has a wealth of knowledge on this issue. Regarding the situation in China, Mr. Mizutani served as a diplomat in China, from secretary to ambassador. He has personally experienced the recent history of China up to the present. So I would like to hear your high opinion. —— Recently, Chinese writers have often come to Japan, and Japanese writers have also gone to China, talking about the issue of Eastern unity in thought. It seems that many of the people who come from China are novelists and writers of new-style poetry, and the people who go from here are also mostly of this type. These people are not very clear about what is Eastern thought, and what is considered Eastern thought. Therefore, whether there is a so-called foundation for Eastern unity, upon careful examination, isn't that something beyond comprehension?</p>
<h3 id="e56">The Necessity of Ideological Restoration <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>I would first like to give a major warning to our Chinese compatriots in spirit. In China, in any case, ideological restoration is most necessary today. China should return to the way of Confucius. Speaking of myself, I am very ashamed. I was born into a Confucian family. My father established himself in the world as a Confucian scholar, and I myself was also educated in the family tradition. Perhaps due to impetuosity, I was very disgusted with Confucianism when I was young. I only thought of the bad aspects of Confucianism. My first book was to ridicule Confucianism. It seems that in Meiji 17, I published a book "Free Morality and Confucianism", and I printed 300 copies of that book and gave it to people. That was to say that Confucianism was very useless. Generally speaking, it was an attack on Japanese Zhu Xi's philosophy. Since then, the times have changed, and sixty years have passed. During that period, I saw research on various Eastern things, and I also saw thinking on various things. I thought that Confucianism was something that did not suit Chinese life in China, but so-called Confucian scholars, whether good or bad, have dominated China for nearly five generations. If you say 9,000 years is too long, then let's say 4,000 years! In short, Confucianism not only applied to China, but also spread to Japan. The daily ethics and morals that Japanese people possess now are generally integrated with the spirit of Confucianism. If we talk about Eastern thought, then there is no political thought other than that. The most reliable way to carry forward the thoughts of China and Japan is to use Confucianism to carry it forward!</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Essence of Confucianism <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The spirit of Confucius, to borrow the words of Count Gotō Shimpei, is "the moralization of politics." If we can act accordingly, that is naturally very good. Confucianism has undergone more than two thousand years of experience since Confucius. Confucianism has been integrated with the character, customs, tastes, thoughts, and all aspects of life of Eastern people, and has become bone, blood, and flesh. Just as Japan has returned to Emperor Jimmu, the Chinese people cannot but return to the principles of Confucius. This is the most necessary thing. If China wants to take this opportunity to sincerely reform its thoughts, then it must explore here.</p>
<p>The so-called progress does not necessarily mean that new things are progress. Returning to good things from the past is also a kind of progress. Just like people in the past were very healthy, but today they are gradually weakening. If they can return to the same healthy body as before, it is also progress for the body. The situation is exactly the same. However, I think this requires a great effort to cheer up.</p>
<p>We are not saying that ideologically, we should completely adopt what Confucius said and what Song Zi wrote without changing a word. The spirit of Confucianism is order is a basic. Speaking of Eastern thought, order is the most necessary. That order is the thought of . The term "ritual" mentioned in Confucianism is order. And there is also philosophy in Confucianism. For example:</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are in their proper places, and all things are nourished.</p>
<p>When we read the Zhong Yong, there are many philosophical thoughts in it. From daily ethical thoughts to what humans should do, it is completely said. If the Chinese people do not return there, everything will be in vain. Mr. Honda probably also knows this very well: that Chinese ancestors, sages, and outstanding figures also know the affairs of China in great detail.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Chinese People Don't Know About China <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>For example, Liang Qichao, Wang Guowei, etc., who are in the same era as us, know the affairs of China best. Today, the average Chinese politician does not know much about the affairs of China. They know neither history nor literature, and what they know about China is probably only a little knowledge of drama. They have nothing to give us in terms of knowledge about China. Not only that, but they mostly do not have the cultivation, or everything else, that they should receive from us. A Chinese person who studies a little about the national conditions is already considered very good. So I think that when it comes to ideological unity, shouldn't we start from this place?</p>
<p>As this gradually progresses, I think everyone will be able to respect and love each other. However, I don't understand what the thoughts of the so-called Chinese literati are like now.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Grit Your Teeth and Build Victory <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Honda: Twenty years ago, the phrase "The revolution has not yet succeeded" was not Sun Wen's last words. The revolution is still in progress. So at that time, the situation in China was just like the situation in the Meiji Era, when the People's Rights Movement was in full swing, to overthrow the clan cliques. At that time, the Freedom Party, led by Bo Tian, ​​put forward the natural human rights theory and the national covenant constitutional theory advocated by Voltaire and Rousseau. Chinese friends have performed all the phenomena of this transitional era. However, this is only after the completion of the Greater East Asia War, under the guidance of Japan, to regenerate into a new country, learning from our era of European and American dominance in the Meiji 20s and 30s. On national thought, China should also return to the Confucian spirit mentioned by Mr. Tokutomi and concretely express it in things. In this way, no matter how hard we want to endure, we should grit our teeth and build a glorious victory in the Greater East Asia War: (The end) (Xiang: From the Western Daily News on October 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Christian Orphanage for Refugees; Education Expenses Will Soon Be Cut Off; Difficult to Maintain, Pity to Close <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Our orphanage has been in operation for three years, specializing in providing education and care for poor, distressed children and street children. In their spare time, they learn agriculture, animal husbandry, tailoring, weaving, and other skills so that they can support themselves when they leave the orphanage. There are currently 102 children, both boys and girls. In the past few months, the cost of education and care has been 17,000 yuan per month, but there has been no specific funding. The required expenses all depend on the generous members of the Christian Church of Mud Pond, who personally raise monthly donations or temporary donations from enthusiastic people from all walks of life to help. Among them, the donations from several cotton industry tycoons were particularly large.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the government's promulgation of decrees to purchase cotton cloth and cotton yarn, the cotton industry has been greatly affected. Those who were able to enthusiastically donate and support our orphanage in the past are now unable to continue donating monthly. In addition, the cotton cloth prepared by our orphanage for making children's clothing has also been stockpiled, and it is not known when it can be moved. As autumn is approaching, if donations are not sustained, meals will inevitably be cut. If the stored cloth cannot be retrieved, then the children's autumn clothes, clothing, and bedding will also be without resources. If this is the case, then the original intention of our colleagues to set up the orphanage to take in the suffering children will be reversed, making them suffer from hunger and cold. If it is closed down and the children are dismissed, the previous efforts of those who have spent money and efforts will be in vain, which is not worth regretting. But the suffering children who originally had no home, who have received several years of education and their lives are on the right track, will lose education and care again. Regardless of whether it is for the individual, society, or the country, it is a great loss. Therefore, we appeal to enthusiastic volunteers to generously offer their compassion and donate funds to help; at the same time, we will find ways to help retrieve the cloth in time and rush to make autumn and winter clothing. Our orphanage will be very fortunate, and the hundred or so suffering children will be very fortunate. Shanghai Christian Orphanage for Refugees, Cao Lane A28, Columbia Road,</p>
