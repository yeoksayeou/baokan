<p>社評</p>
<h3>談民富國強之道</h3>
<p>參戰與建國興業及政治外交少關係，和民間的期待，已詳前昨兩評。我們認爲中國之參戰，爲求解放中國，保衛東亞；而其前提須有一個自强的中國，吾則切皆是紙上文章。中國自强所須努力之方面甚多，而其最要者，莫如國民經濟生活之改善。</p>
<p>中國過去的錯誤，是沒有努力完成工業化，今後政府及人民，都應向此方面努力；更希望友邦從工具，資本，人才，技術各方面充分援助。因爲中國若不工業化，人民經濟生活即不能改善，中國卽不能富强，而日本所負片面的責任太重。我國幅圓廣闊，各地經濟背景不盡相同，有的天然適合於農業，有的還只能提倡畜牧；但今日在和平區內，則大都適合於現代工業，即工業畜牧，也應作爲向工業化發展的過程，而不能認爲最後的目標。今日世界的一般經濟生活，由於交通距離的日益縮短，各國非有無相通，打成一片不可，友邦的理想，就是要資源互助，有無相通，這是絕對合理近情的。我國的對外經濟政策，自亦根據這理想，對於各友善國家，不僅有所求，且願有所予。所以我們主張，中國要以工業化爲目標，而今日應加緊確定根本經濟政策，以奠立將來建國興業的基礎。我們的主要工作，應注意於（一）切實調查全國資源，何者爲我們富有的，可以分給友邦；何者雖爲我們所有，而資本，人才，技術都不夠，應要友邦共同開發，共同利用。何者爲友邦所缺而爲我們所富有，可大量供應。（二）研究某某區域有某某特產，適宜於某某工業，都應開始作通盤規劃，切實研究，妥爲分配。（三）現在國與國之問，尙宜有無相通，各展所長，我國內部地方與地方間，自更應互通有無，華北華中與華南間之界域觀念，應求其完全消泯。（四）我國地大物博，政府與民間應切實協力。凡不需要政府主持者，應充分給民間有發展其力量的機會。尤有進者，經濟範圍包括本極廣泛，政府今日即應統籌經濟的全局，制定財政的規劃，而不可因財政的便利，輕定經濟的大計。在參戰期內，國家用途不免浩繁，政府自不能不以財政爲重心，但今後應就國家經濟與國民經濟的利害，以定財政設施的範轉，必須達到「地盡其利，民盡其力」，然後才有「民富國强」的希望。</p>
<p>經濟與政治，外交，交通等，都有極密切的關係，欲從經濟上致國家於富强，在參戰時盡參戰之責任，則必須政治之全面的修明，政風之普遍的改善，簡政之澈底的實現，外交陣容之强化，以及對友邦協力的更求其密切。，而經濟與交通，更息息相關，過去以地方未盡平靖，致使公私生活受交通不便之苦，眞可謂創鉅痛深。今幸各地漸復常態，則今後欲言發展經濟，即首須整頓交通。果能在中日誠摯的協力之下，而達到貨暢其流，則不僅公私兩便，抑且中日交利。鐵路公路，固望其有更合理之利用，而水道交通，在華中華南各地，及華北若干省份，亦宜盡發展。同時改善及增加各種輔助的交通工具，務使一蔁可通之水，皆成船舶梳織之塲，一輪可輾之道，悉為車輛輻輳之地，則脈絡貫通，經濟開發，必可「事半功倍」。而沿海及海外交通，凡有助於華南華中華北間之統一，及有利於中日滿與南洋各地之聯絡者，亦望中日專家共同研究籌謀，政府亦應極早規劃。總之，中國之富强，爲解放中國保衛東亞之主要的安定勢力，不僅我國上下，亟須匪勉，即友邦人士，似亦宜多所策勵與協助的。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>七洋海軍與英美關係</h3>
<p>美國海軍部長諾克斯曾在衆議院聲稱：「美國若只有兩洋海軍，早巳不能滿足，非整備足以控制世界七洋之大海軍不可。」和這個主張競爭的，便是其後不久陸軍部長史汀生的大言，他這樣說：「我們到一九四三年底，要整備八百二十萬的陸軍，而且這個計畫並不是建立防衛的陸軍，而是採取即時攻勢，因爲必須抓住業已到來的好機會，使戰爭於最短期內終畢的緣故。」這樣，海陸兩當局競相發表其龐大的計畫，以煽動其民衆，不用說，只是欲以架空的數字，來瞞過其深刻的敗戰煩惱，不得已而出的笨策。</p>
<p>尤其是諾克斯，他不但在做着編練七洋海軍的幻夢，而於現實的問題上，亦作着這樣的傲語：「美國業已造成二倍於開戰以來喪失於太平洋水域的戰艦，因此，在三月裏，當予日本一重大打擊。」美海軍當局誇示其造艦工程的迅迎，累决的發表，即使完全可以相信，然而開戰以後，其戰艦的就役者，也不過華盛頓型四艘，進水二艘而已，至於航空母艦及巡洋艦以下，則寥寥無幾。把這話拿來和日本的偉大戰果－擊沉戰艦十一，航空母艦十一，巡洋艦五十七，驅逐艦五十四－對照，則他們所造的艦，尙不足補充其一半。美海軍所發表者，常爲迥避其敗戰的責任，始終用以欺騙其國民者，可是冷酷的數字，却毫無遺憾地把它證明了。</p>
<p>然而這裏可稱爲滑稽的事，便是一意依靠美國的軍備增强，以美國製造的武器作戰，簞食壺漿以迎派遣至大陸的美軍，那樣萬不獲已的英國，對於諾克斯的囈語，也在大動其神經，露呈了猜疑的感情。不用說，英國最近的對美輿論硬化的傾向，不獨因着七洋海軍而表現的。日前英國殖民大臣斯丹萊在牛津大學演說，謂英國爲換得五十艘驅逐艦而租與美國的西印度羣島，實是構成英帝國的領域者。對之，美國副總統華萊斯，副國務卿威爾士，則同時實稱謂：「設置於中南美的臨時軍事根據地，於戰爭告終時，當然交還，然而美洲以外之根據地則吾，」以此諷示西印度羣島之永久佔有。尤其是參議員密勒·泰定，曾作這樣的盛氣之言：「非英國先表明移讓租借諸島作爲修訂軍備租借法的絕對條件不可。」</p>
<p>這樣，正當英國的政界醞釀着不安的空氣之中，美國的聯合通信社，却對於英國北非常駐大臣麥克米蘭的就職，傳出美國現欲任命紐約市長拉。格迪亞爲北非總督之對抗消息。當然，華盛頓當局對於美聯社的這僩消息，是表示緘默的，然而那個絨默，就使英國感到不快。因此視美國有佔領北非的野心，而使輿論强硬，乃是　所必然的。</p>
<p>英美與蘇聯，同床異夢，這已無用說得，然而英美協調的前途，果眞在那裏呢？際此戰爭遂行方酣，鷸蚌之爭，隨處有得利漁翁，這可說是帝國主義戰爭最後難免的運命吧、（丁：譯自三月十五日讀賣報知）</p>

<p>各國卽將交還</p>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　北京公使館區域係於一九〇一年基於庚子事件所設定者、東西長約一二〇〇米、南北寬約六五米、面積約二〇〇英畝爲一長方形之區域、俗稱東交民巷、條約關係國家、有日、德、義、英、美、西班牙、比利時、奧大利、匈牙利、荷蘭、蘇聯等十一國、淸政府根據該條約承認以各國所在區域、供各國公使館之用、並將同區域內之警察權歸屬於各國公使館、國人無居住之權、並承認該區域爲各國之武裝地帶、故該區域當時之情形已成爲一特別行政區域、中國人中除公使館之雇用人員外、均無居住之權、一切行政、均須受列國外交團主席之指示、我國對此特別區域、屢欲予以收回、然以關係複雜、一時不果實現、而時至今日、當時之條約關係國中之奧大利與匈牙利兩國、已小復存在、英美權益、亦因我國參戰時、國府聲明廢棄、而日本又有先承認我國收回該區域、故預料其他關係國家、亦將隨之交還國府、</p>
<p>褚外長這談話</p>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　中日當局簽訂關於北京公使館區域之條款及了解事項後、外交　　部長特發表談話、茲錄原文於后、本月十四日我國與日本訂立日本專管租界交還實施細目條款後、今日復訂立北京公使館區域收回實施條款、亦規定於本月三十日即還都紀念日實施、可知日本對其所作之諾言、無不積極履行、</p>
<p>北京公使館區域之設立、始於一九〇一年、以自衛爲名、實施獨占的行政、實開國際之惡例、該區域範圍雖小、而儼如敵體、此種特殊狀態成立、巳四十餘年、現因事變境遷、早已消失其存在之理由、我國欲收回其行政權者、已非一日、因關係較爲複雜、遷延至今、迄未成功、友邦日本爲助我國之獨立發展、不但交還其全部專管租界、目卒先同意我國之收回使館區域、其援助我國之熱誠與決意、實深銘感、</p>
<p>自去歲德義等國承認國府之後、歐陸諸邦、相繼取同樣之步驟、並先後派遣外交官駐在我國、友好關係日進一日、本年一月九日，我國參戰以來、與盟邦日本及歐洲諸友好國家之關係益加密切、我國爲求掃除政治經濟等各方發展之障礙、完成獨立與自主、必須收回租界及撤廢治外法權、公使館區域雖非租界、但其自治行政機關之組織與租界相類同、茲我國決心收回、友邦日本首先贊同、已於今日訂立實施之條款、內容允當、作爲模楷、想其他關係國家、必可同樣接受、現我國與成立正常外交關係之各國、正日謀增進其睦誼、上述使館區之特殊狀態、實無復絲毫存在之理由、諒其他關係國家必可贊同我國收回之主張、現我國就此問題、正與關係國商討且多表示同意、且見此等國家之友好精神、俟技術上商定、即可完全實施收回、且爲深信此舉實現、我國與諸友好國家之親善關係、必益加增進、可以無疑、</p>
<p>好富部長談話</p>

<p>柏林二十二日海通社電　柏林居民數千人、昨日覩希特勒元首與戈林元帥之豐采、足以證實郭培爾於數日前對報界所稱、英美謠傳德元首抱恙之訊完全非確之語、德元首面部之皺紋雖較前增加、但精神飽滿、毫無病容、三年半以來之戰事、使希特勒元首之面部益見莊重、其聲浪亦益形嚴肅、希特勒元首昨日之演說、係以德軍總司令之地位而發表之、以政治方面而觀、仍一貫去年十一月八日所採取之觀點、渠昭吿人民曰、「吾方決不再談和平、當此次戰事結束之日、亦即與布爾雪維克携手之國家崩潰之時、英帝國亦因所犯罪惡而自食崩潰之結果、」希特勒元首旋痛斥邱吉爾所持之政策、此與「吾的奮鬬」一書中所闡明之德外國交政策、完全處於敵對之地位、關於最近多所討論之歐洲新秩序問題、德元首昨未直接論及、殆因昨日之演說　屬軍事性質之故元首續稱、德軍在東綫之危機業已安渡、前綫將士所有之限制亦已取消、希氏最後宣布德軍陣亡之數字爲五十四萬二千人、茲爲表示此項數字之正確性起見、將第一次世界大戰時德軍之損失作一比較、按第一次世界大戰四年半之戰事中、德軍之損失爲二、〇三六·八九七人、再加奧匈帝國軍隊中德人之損失爲四二〇·〇〇〇人、而此次三年半之戰事中、德軍損失之數僅及第一次大戰中之四分之一、此由於德蘇戰事之初　、德軍之損失爲數極微之故云、</p>
<h3>邱吉爾演說　戰後計劃　認戰事將曠日持久</h3>
<p>里期本二十二日同盟社電英首相邱吉爾昨夜廣播演說、略謂、一部份人以爲戰事即結束、余實未能如此樂觀實則戰爭或將遷延一年甚至二年、因之、在此大戰正酣之際、即遽爾討論國界問題、其愚實不可及、邱吉爾於是說明其戰後四年計畫、如保障失業、國民健康及普及敎育之類、惟戰後稅則將較戰前爲重云、</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十二日海通社電倫敦電訊、英相邱吉爾昨夜發表廣播演說、曾梗述創立歐洲議會之計劃、其言略謂、此項組織應成爲確有國效力之聯盟、可藉國家或國際力量執行其決議、除列强之外、各小國亦應加入之、但以符合英美蘇三國之利益爲前提、但化此時詳論戰後之問題及爭執疆界等問題、實屬愚者之行爲、邱吉爾繼謂、皮弗里傑計劃乃一改良社會情形之四年計劃、免蹈二十五年前之覆轍、邱吉爾末謂、英第八軍現已在北非發動攻勢云、</p>
<p>德方評論</p>
<p>柏林二十二日海通社電德國外交部重要官員向海通社外交防員費煦爾稱、邱吉爾宣布戰後計劃、顯欲消除英報抨擊波蘭對蘇領土要求之不良印象、但邱吉爾之計劃、並未保證波蘭及波羅的海各國之人民、邱吉爾以爲小國之集團、可以阻止布爾希維克化、然渠已遺忘國聯集體安全機構之失敗、邱吉爾之改良社會狀况之四年計劃、對落伍之英國人似若進步、而在德國、則此項問題久已解決矣、邱吉爾爲取悅於保守份子、故申言在計劃經濟下、亦有個人自動發展之餘地、邱吉爾提及戰局時警吿英國民衆勝利尙難獲致、本年內協約國絕少獲勝之機會云、</p>

<h3>日美空戰座談會　續完　從空襲路綫說到防禦方法種種</h3>
<p>日本爲何不設航空省？日美都有陸海不同的空軍。</p>
<p>記者：現在我們再談一些關於可否設置航空省的問題。是否在很久以前，就有人提出設立航空省的問題？</p>
<p>藤田：這一問題並不在軍事範圍內。這並非指空軍省。是指空軍說的麼？是想把遞信省的航空局改爲省的吧！</p>
<p>記者：是指空軍說的。</p>
<p>藤田：意思是說，想使空軍脫離陸軍和海軍麼？</p>
<p>記者：按理是這種意思。</p>
<p>藤田：我認爲日本還是維持現狀的好。</p>
<p>大西：因爲各個任務有所不同。</p>
<p>藤田：在外國，空軍獨立雖然得到順利發展，但在日本，還是照目前這種情形好。</p>
<p>大西：也許只有日本和美國，特別擁有海軍方面的航空。這是因爲日本和美國必須在太平洋上進行戰爭。這就是海軍方面特別有空軍的理由。英國有時空軍獨立，有時附屬於他部，但現在好像是不附屬於陸軍和海軍裏。也許空軍統一了。</p>
<p>藤田：現在不是這樣。</p>
<p>大西：最初曾劃分過睦海兩方的空軍，這因爲各自有特殊任務。若是不這樣劃分開，我以爲將來雙方底長處就會抹殺的。</p>
<p>中島：這正如大西閣下所指出的樣子，還是照現在的悄形好。</p>
<p>大西：但現在並沒有合併陸海兩省的空軍而成爲一獨立空軍省的意向。</p>
<p>本內：有人說現狀也有困難，且德國有獨立的空軍部，所以我國可以改爲獨立的。這一派人雖然有，但我認爲外國有外國的特殊情形，日本有日本的特殊情形。外國改爲獨立空軍省對，　日本就不一定對。</p>
<p>大西：德國飛機因爲全是陸上機。以前畢斯麥號戰鬥艦被擊沉時，飛機雖然飛去援助，但結果沒有找到戰塲，而竟自飛回來。這是因爲沒有海上飛行的習慣。總之，海上訓練若不隨同艦隊一起，那無論如何是不能收若何效果的。</p>
<p>本內：一般說來，海洋上雖然寬廣，其航行似乎容易，實際上却很難。</p>
<p>大西：船在海中航行，雖然非常寬廣，似乎不容易相互撞碰，但事實上却有時候相互撞傷，以至撞沉。</p>
<p>本內：即使注意看着自己的方向前進，但也需要技術能力。</p>
<p>大西：海面跟陸地不同，用不着「打住」那種麻煩，但航海仍然需要相當的訓練。</p>
<p>記者：我們再回到方才的問題上，請指敎一二關於軍用機將如何發展問題。</p>
<p>大西：就是方才所講的成層圈。</p>
<p>記者：成層圈，以及長距離等問題，前面雖然講過一些，但還請指敎一二。</p>
<p>岡田：成層圈飛行是在飛來的時候，但在轟炸時卻要在一萬公尺的空中。總之，若不低飛，是非常不容易投彈到目標上。</p>
<p>松浦：轟炸大都市的塲台，從高空也可以轟炸的吧！</p>
<p>岡田：在「防空必携」上不是寫着四千公尺麼？如果在這以上的高空轟炸的話，則叫地面上的人看來，就有點輕視牠，說牠太膽小，以致對地面上的影響就會削弱。在高空一方面不容易炸到目標，而另一方面又不足以嚇人，所以一定要在適當的天空上實行轟炸。何况威嚇又是空襲的一個主要任務呢？</p>
<p>阿部：論效果當然是如此囉！</p>
<p>藤田：因爲高空總是刮着强烈的各方面的風，所以從高處投彈是很不容易中的的。</p>
<p>未來日美空軍大戰的輪廓，只有日本轟炸美國方有利。</p>
<p>岡田：投彈中的，與影響人心，這就是空襲的目的。</p>
<p>阿部：或者讓人民聽一些爆炸聲，或者讓人民看一些悲慘景象，也許更收大的效果。</p>
<p>大西：飛到一萬三千公尺以上的高空，該如何困難地俯瞰地面。祇當天氣睛朗的時候，方能看出水陸交界處。</p>
<p>松浦：上看下容易，下看　難。所以上面的人找下面的目標很容易。當飛來數十架或數百架飛機時，自然不會一一尋找目標投彈。</p>
<p>阿部：還有每個投彈者的技術也有很大熟練程度上的差別。</p>
<p>本內：如果不能發明瞄準器，也許在近一二年內不會使用成層圈飛機來轟炸，但現在高速度的飛機大量產出，但機械優美的飛機，也日新月異地製造出來。無論是軍用機，也無論是輸送機，昨天的，到了今天便成爲古董了。</p>
<p>記者：　日本目前也在研究成層圈飛機麼？</p>
<p>本內：　凡是外國正在研究者，日本也正在研究中。</p>
<p>藤田：　日本也許有了相當的成就，而祇是不能講出來。</p>
<p>本內：　降落傘部隊也都以爲對方有，而自己沒有，結果教們的還相當齊備。</p>
<p>藤田：　問體祇是我們必須搶先而不落後。</p>
<p>記者：　這樣說來，我們也許很容易去轟炸紐約吧！</p>
<p>西。　那是不能去的。飛機速力雖然很快，但沒有那種快法。還差百分之三十速度呢。</p>
<p>松浦：　決不是說多快就有多快。</p>
<p>大西：　大概再有百分之三十左右的速度，就差不多了。</p>
<p>松浦：　這是用數學方法得出來的。</p>
<p>大西：　如果是這樣就可以，去的時候是西風，回來的時候是東風，祗要是來回都是順風當然可能轟炸去。但始終是西風，回來時則成爲頂風，去時到是順風。</p>
<p>藤田：　回來時則很不便當。（哄堂大笑）那末回來時可以繞轉地球回來。</p>
<p>記者：　就到此處，我們結東吧！諸位都在百忙中而特別光臨賜敎，鄙人特別致謝。（季譯自二月號實業之世界）</p>
<h3>蘇軍冬季反攻檢討　未能達到預期目的</h3>
<p>（柏林十一日同盟社電）蘇聯之冬季反攻，雖傳史達林親赴前綫，臨陣指揮，然而今年雪融特早，出乎意料，復因南部戰綫德軍之猛烈反擊，致未能達到所期目的，反而處於不得不防備穗軍夏季大攻勢之狀態。德國新聞社軍事記者於十一日就紅軍當初之目標與至今之結果，比較檢討，而作如下之評論。</p>
<p>紅軍此次反攻之目標，第一在於奪回烏克蘭，第二在於使德軍退至聶伯河，第三在於奪回克利米亞半島以恢復黑海支配權，當無疑問餘地。此種見解，衹須一顧二月間紅軍進擊踪跡，卽可了然，且爲蘇聯本身所聲明者。德軍之彈性防禦戰，其最重要結果之一，不得不舉出者，厥爲紅軍在德軍防衛錢中，未看出「戰略」而看出「弱點」是也。</p>
<p>蘇聯軍事專家早已於二月五日，以「德軍除退至聶伯河而待紅軍之新攻勢外，當無其他辦法」爲題，而謂「可堵住德軍之退却者，惟有展開驚人的局叫之一事耳。」然而現在「局面之展開」，旣在進行，但不値以「驚人的」一語稱之。紅軍最高司令部，信爲已得貫通唐納資一綫，乃發動數個軍團於多尼普羅貝特洛烏斯克及柴波羅其挨方面，而在該方面自掘其墳墓。</p>
<p>此等紅軍之撲滅，於第三年之德蘇戰爭，可謂開一新紀元，德軍在此廣泛之戰綫，重握優牛權，烏克蘭之大半，已拒紅軍於門外，而唐納資之大資源，亦不許紅軍到達，將永久拒之於門外歟。在過去二星期間，德軍之攻擊部隊，再如潮湧，開始向東進擊；現在戰鬥之中心地爲卡科夫南方地區與奧萊爾南方地區，尤其在後者之戰塲，紅軍欲挽回在瀾於旣倒，正繼續其必至之反攻。德軍當局曾謂「因精銳部隊巳被調至主要戰塲，故中部戰綫，已許紅軍反攻」：但紅軍在此戰綫策動大攻勢，其目的在於欲奪回波羅的海諸國，則不難明瞭。</p>
<p>共產主義於歐洲任何國家，均爲致命的危險，波羅的海諸國國民，無不知之，故渠等皆來參加此次歐洲戰爭，而與蘇聯作戰。據穗軍當局宣稱，拉特維亞及立陶宛兩國國民，目下正在組織義勇軍，而愛沙尼亞義勇軍，則業已擔當德軍衛隊之一翼，參加反共戰爭矣。在此現狀之下，蘇聯欲奪回波羅的海三國，其企圖實不易實現。（丁：譯自三月十四日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>德軍掌握戰局主動　奪取卡科夫的意義</h3>
<p>（柏林十二日特電）東綫南部正面的德軍，突破卡科夫敵軍防綫，陸續衝入市內，掃湯北部與西部二地區，佔領市街中心部之紅色廣塲，南部地區則尙繼續巷戰，然其殲滅，不過時間問題而已。該市被紅軍克復後，僅經三星期，現在將再歸德軍所有。德軍此次進擊卡科夫，其主力於戰車隊掩護之下，喘良不暇，一氣進擊，把展開於廣大戰錢的紅軍部隊，截成數段，然後一一加以殲滅。而且克服了無數的沼澤，小河，丘陸，山岳地帶，森林地等天然的惡條件。德軍之這種驚人的進擊，不能不爲之極口稱贊的。至於此次戰鬥的眞正重要意義，則可分爲如下三點來述。</p>
<p>第一，由於德軍展開廣大的　圍和深度一齊的總進擊，致使紅軍除作局部的抵抗外，不能再作何等有組織的抗戰。因着這個總進擊，紅軍的三個軍團就此潰滅，附屬的戰車隊和機械化中隊，亦受到徹底的打擊，戰果尙在擴大之中，紅軍兵團的損失可知是極大的。</p>
<p>第二，總反攻的結果，德軍除重佔廣大的地域外，更重要者，爲把龐大的紅軍俘獲和殲滅。這個結果，據前綫傳來報吿，謂其他戰綫上的紅軍，恐蹈前車覆轍，正在撤退中云。</p>
<p>第三，此役及於共他戰綫的影饗，不能忽視。因爲紅軍由於在卡科夫地區的大敗，致其對　綫全部之大規模反攻企圖，完全喪失，作戰的主動性，已完全爲德軍所奪。</p>
<p>這樣，在唐納資，聶伯，米烏斯三河所圍的地帶內，德軍之地盤已全面强化，於將來的春季攻勢，已整備好有利的態勢了。甚至在紅軍優勢下的東綫中部戰區，亦以卡科夫一役爲契機，戰局的主動性，將全爲德軍所掌握。即就維亞茲瑪地區而言，紅軍亦沒有如許預備隊，可以追及穗軍之戰略的撤退，故撤退的德軍，得以其殿車，從容鞏固新防綫。（丁：譯自三月十四日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>英美對蘇的矛盾點　三國之間包含三種利害</h3>
<p>（沮利克多村特派員十五日電），英美對蘇之複雜利害的關係，自加薩勃朗加會談以來，已趨表面化，最近因着美國駐蘇大使斯丹萊的「失言」問題，更呈難以解決的面貌，不過現在這三國關係，美蘇特呈對立深刻化的現象，英國則毋寗居於美蘇間調停的立塲，殊堪注目。此次英國外相艾登的訪美，可說亦是把調整美蘇關係作為其目的之一。</p>
<p>最近美國的對蘇方針，在日前美副總統華萊斯的道個「欲使美英蘇三國間的協力成爲可能，蘇聯先應放棄其世界革命的運動」之要求中，已完全表明了。即美國此時先欲明白蘇聯將來的政策，由此而決定其對蘇的政策，不過美國所抱最大的關心，却是今後蘇聯對於重慶及其他？究將採用如何的政策。關於此點，最近上院議員霍伊拉的宣稱，已明白把它指出，他說：史達林的戰爭目的不能明白，美國就不能樹立將來的世界計劃。」加薩勃朗加會談前後，羅斯福曾希望與史達林會見，這不用說，是基於上述方針的，可是史達林至今，始終把羅斯福的會見要求當作耳旁風，不予理睬。美國欲由租借西伯利亞根據地使蘇聯參與東亞戰局，當爲周知的事實，然而同時，美國對於蘇聯之舉動，却懷着危懼之心，這又是値得注目的，不過這裏應該指出的，乃是美國前駐蘇大使布利特，嘗就美國的對蘇政策，作過如次的公言：</p>
<p>「如果某一個外國政府的政策，不副美國的希望時，則非努力使其依照吾人的意思而動作不可，要達到這個目的，有兩個方法，那兩個方法如拿驅驢的例子來比方，第一個就是用胡蘿蔔拿到驢的鼻端去引誘它，第二個就是用鞭去鞭它的屁股，這樣的比方，就容易明白了」。</p>
<p>美國對蘇的胡蘿葡，是否就是軍備租借法德强化呢？還是第二戰綫的展開呢？現在姑置不論。不過斯丹萊的失言，却可視爲是一種嫌惡蘇聯之意識的「失言」，而關於西伯利亞的根據地問題，則可認爲美國有出以布利特所謂「鞭」的政策的模樣。</p>
<p>處於其間而與美蘇雙方均有比較的親善關係的英國，現在正　其苦心於調停兩者的一事上。然而英蘇關係，共本身亦有波蘭問題在作梗，因此逐漸有碰壁之勢，也是値得注目的。即波蘭的亡命政權，藉大西洋憲章，主張保障戰後的獨立，（當然那是指反軸心國勝利時而說的）對之，蘇聯則徹底主張併呑波蘭而不相讓。英國若是忠於大西洋憲章，則非覺悟有使蘇聯晚離反軸心陣營不可；若是聽從蘇聯的要求，則英美之唯一的戰爭目的之大西洋憲章。即被根本否定，從而將陷於招致比利時，波蘭，捷克，南斯拉夫，希臘等亡命小國政權之全面的離反的窘境。英國政界以這個問題爲中心，已作着種種的議論，然而最近以簽署「和平條件」而聞名的愛德華·哈來特·卡，却於本月十日，投寄倫敦泰晤時報一文，就英美蘇緊密協力的問題，叙述其意見如次：</p>
<p>「不解決東歐問區而保障西歐的安全，絕不可能，此時吾人特應回憶的，就是凡爾賽會議中所決定的東歐劃界全歸失敗的一事。英國不顧這個錯誤而仍堅持，於一九三九年以但澤問題爲中心，予波蘭以保障，結果乃引起德蘇協定的成立，終乃見第二次大戰的爆發。原則上吾人非否定民族自決主義不可，吾人以列强確立絕對的霸權爲最當，認爲小國是應該各各從屬於這個霜權的。</p>
<p>關於上述見解，卡氏於所謂「和平條件」中曾詳述如次。</p>
<p>「大西洋憲童中所包含之民族自決主義的原則，其錯誤就是小國畢竟不能適用；因爲中東歐的小國，實不適合於國家這個概念的。故東歐戰前的「現狀」，不能作爲決定戰後狀態的基準；所以此等小國應劃入蘇聯的勢力範圍而維持其存在。惟有如此，此等小國方能與英國協力和平。」</p>
<p>當地報紙以爲上述卡氏的主張是把英政府的見解，作非正式的表示者，似在使小國亡命政權感到失望耳；然而中立國消息靈通的人士，却以爲蘇聯只要與德軍主力繼續作世紀的決戰，則英國的保身之策，除對東歐諸國採取「出賣」政策外，別無他法。這樣，包含着絕對不能解決的矛盾之英美蘇三國關係，隨着這個矛盾的擴大深化，逐漸進入不能自拔的階段。（丁：譯自三月十七日讀賣報知）</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>節電</h3>
<p>節約，原是一菰美德，在任何時代，任何塲合，都應該節約，尤其戰時，因爲物資消耗量的激增，對於節約，已經不是消極的美德，而是積極的絕對服從的事了。</p>
<p>電力——工切工業生產的動力，是何等迫切的需要，爲了增加生產，就必需把電力集中在工業一點上，至少要把一切非生產的電力消耗减至最少限度；而移用於一切生產上面，這是一種淺顯的理論。</p>
<p>可是，我們來返顧一下目前上海的電力情形，一方面非生產的消耗，雖則屢經限制，然而娛樂塲所，飲食塲所，櫉窗樣子間等處，事實上還是輝煌萬丈，是不是已經减至最小限度的消耗量呢？而另一方面舊有的工廠工塲，因爲電力限制，一星期內只能工作三天或五天，而預備籌設的工廠工塲，因爲得不着雷力，就無法開工。一般的說，戰時國家的工業應該日以繼夜的生產，以滿足需要。那末，我們的工業，怎能算合乎增加生產的原則呢？</p>
<p>我們盼望有關當局注視這一種不合理的現象，消極方面，再限制非生產的電力消耗；積極方面，趕速想法煤斤，增加電力，充分供給生產的工廠工塲，因爲「增加生產」，已是戰時經濟政策綱領中最要的一點，同時，也是爭取大東亞戰爭勝利主要的物資因素呢！</p>

<h3>讀者論壇再論青年就業問題  羅柴夫　　讀了本壇葉敏鶴君的「靑年們的職業問題」後，覺得這實在是一個嚴重問題。眼看着又有一批畢業生要想踏進社會了，爲了畢業勿使它成爲失業的別名，所以我們應宜未雨而綢繆，提出幾點切於實際的辦法，救濟禾來的一批失業羣，更也如葉君所說：一請社會人仕負起眞正領導的責任，是靑年之幸，也是社會之幸」更是國家，人類之幸。　　爲了這些原因，所以我更盼望將畢業的學生們自己組織起來，來解決自己的切身問題，我們每一個同學，都有一點理想，就是舉業之後，仍能够互通友情，記得在自由談有過一篇「溫暖的友情」的文章，內容說在中學時代的朋友，往往是眞正的朋友，可以成爲終生的知己，因爲小學時代是不懂得友情的可貴的，而大學或社會中有了「錢」的毒素滲入，不容易有知己交到。並且大家也想着，如果畢業之後仍再能一塊作事，那是多麼有扶助的一會事。　　有了這幾點益處，所以咱們一班同學已組織了一個有永久性的同學會，在會中也討論到這職業問題，蒙師畏與同學的深切討論，得到了一點實際的方法，所以我不妨記下，以供參考。　　（一）調查表—調查每一個同學畢業後是升學還是就業？想就何種職業？家長的職業是甚麼？　　塡就後就分成二部份，一部分是升學，一部份是就業，再在就業中想就同樣職業的同學放在一塊，而最重要的便是要知道家長的職業。　　爲什麼呢？因爲知道了之後，就懇切地要求家長與學校合作起來，以便傳遞招考的消息，譬如某家長是銀行界很孰悉的，那麼如有某銀行招考的消息透露之後，便可預先通知在表內塡了想就銀行職業的同學加以準備應考，這是一個非常適應現社會招考一斑辦法的，因爲現在每一地方在招考時，在表面全不發表招考消息，更不會登報招考，全需要內裏的人介紹子弟前去應考，無人介紹也根本不知道什麼地方在招考，這是第一點好處，第二點便是有希望達到「一同求學，一同就業」的理想，因爲有多人去同時應考，那同時錄取多人也是可能的。　　（二）通信錄—調查完竣後，再由學校當局與以前畢業的校友通消息，因爲校友畢業之後已有大部份有了職業，那麼在他們所服務的職業圈內，需要添人與否，他們自然也可以預先知道，預先介紹了。　　這兩點方法，我想不論同學本身，學校，家長都很樂意携起手來合作的，尤其是家長們，能見自己下了資本的一張即期支票，能够立刻兌現，那不論職業的高低，薪水的多少也是在內心充滿了安慰的，而我們自己呢，能够早一點得到職業，早一點熟悉社會的實　情形，當然也是非常快樂的。經濟界　　昨聯銀券。成交淸稀中，經營者售出三元七角三分，收進三元六角八分，軋小二分，門市售價須三元七角半，收進三元六角半。日軍票回緊，同業互做價五元五角五分五六釐。小錢莊與銀號鬥市售出五元五角六分，收進四分半評言今後同業公會的責任　　全國商業統制總會旣巳成立，其基層組織的各種同業公會，所負使命最巨，所肩責任最大，尤應加强力量，負起職責，來完成這艱巨的工作。那天成立會時，陳市長言：「全國商業統制總會的設施；必須以民生利害爲前提，能幹須幹，不能幹亦須幹，倘只能幹則幹，不能幹便不幹，試問誰人來幹？」梅部長也說：「商業統制總會之機構，以後能否實施所負的使命，推動統制的工作，胥視機構的强弱而定。但統制工作，單靠政府力量，還嫌不够，必須集中全國經濟力量，才能達到目的。同時統制機構的本身，宜條量發揮自治精神，總合各方面之實力，機構方能健全，工作方能成功。」這許多話，都是强化同業公會的要旨，不但强化而已，還須公會本身要有大無畏的精神，任勞任怨，不折不回；更須要有自治的精神，廉潔公正，淸白乃心。　　已往許多同業公會最大缺點是：（一）散漫無力量，（二）便利少數人的私圖，（三）領袖不負責任，聽一二書記幹事之類，營私舞弊，（四）辦事人一逢困難時候，便想辭職告退，半途而廢，（五）依賴政府，不思團結同業自身，來發生力量。　此五點，不僅同業公會如此，仟何工商團體，總免不了這個大病，這是要絕對避免的。　　希望今後的各種同業公會，要矯正以前的弊病，在全國商業統制總會領導之下，實行下列幾個原則：　　（一）集中同業力量，加緊集體組織。凡屬同業，務必加入公會，不得自由行動。　　（二）凡旣任同業公會職務，以後要絕對公正廉潔，不得瞻顧情面，自便私圖；尤其是要約束部下書記幹事人等，不可營私舞弊；遇到困難時，尤應勞怨不辭，硬着頭皮去幹，咬緊牙關去做。　　（三）公會力量，要從自身發出；如果有自治精神，團結力量，則一方通力合作，以謀本業的福利，同時還可協助政府，推行經濟政策。　　我們希望政府趕快修訂同業公會法，以整飭全國的同業公會，輔佐全國商業統制總會來推行這重要的戰時經濟政策中儲副總裁錢大櫆氏　呈請滬行經理照準　遺缺由監事戴藹廬繼任　　南京二十二日中央社電　中儲上海分行籌備之時，環境險惡，應付困難，故由該行副總裁錢大櫆氏，兼任經理，以資開創，而謀發展，開業之後，因錢氏之努力，基礎日漸穩固，業務日漸發達，大東亞戰爭勃發後，租界內之英美及渝方之殘餘勢力，均已肅淸，租界治安，日漸確立，錢氏以經理已無由副總裁兼任之必要，迭向總裁周佛海氏請辭兼職，均經周氏懇切慰留，以至於今，最近錢氏復以該行局面益大，事業愈繁，應以全力襄贊總裁，謀全行之發展，深覺時間精力均不能再兼滬行職務，故再提出兼職辭呈，經周氏詳加考慮，巳允照准，並內定該行監事兼華興銀行常務童事戴藹廬繼任，聞戴氏奉令將於四月一日前往視事。　　（又訊）該行總務處處長，向由調查處處長吳繼雲兼任，刻吳以不迧兼顧，請辭總務處長，業經周總裁照准，並派該處副處長馬驥良爲處長。新中央儲蓄會　葉扶霄爲主席委員　李達吳繼雲爲黨務委員　　中央社滬訊　中央儲蓄會自於本月十九日解除軍管理後，即經國府財政部呈准由中央儲備銀行籌撥基金繼承其資產負債經營一切儲蓄業務，同時聘任唐壽民等十五人爲該會監理委員會委員，於十九日正式組織成立新中央儲蓄會監理委員會，舉行第一次監理委員會議，推定葉扶霄爲監理委員會主席委員，吳繼雲李達二人爲常務委員，規定每月召開監理委員會議一次其內部組織，仍舊分爲會計庶務文書營業四課，惟營業課之儲蓄事宜，四劃開另設備蓄課。聞業務方面則擴大範圍，籌劃發行復興經濟獎券，特種分期繳款儲蓄，及有獎還本備蓄券等，得多方面鼓勵入民之備蓄興趣，所有事變前舊中央儲蓄會原有之儲戶，經過合法手續，仍可繼續其權益。華北開發公司　津島總裁談話　　北京二十二日中央社電　華北開發公司津島總裁，前此赴南京上海視察，並與華中方面當局懇談後，業於二十日返抵此間。頃據談稱，國府中樞當局對華北之經濟狀况，頗爲明瞭，並對華北經濟建設之順利進展，極表滿意。上海經濟界人士，對日方之新方針頗爲稱讚，日率先表明協力之意向，隨撤廢華中物資移動之防制，同時設立全國商業統制總會，因此華中物價問題，已有圓滿解决之望。此項組織影響於華北經濟者，誠復不小，故似擬於天津設立統制會之分部，然此分會之設，則絕非爲實施華北物資配給統制者。總之，今後華北華中必須以有無相通之方針，而作更進一步之緊密連繫。商統會下層機構　以中日商界合作爲主旨　　全國商業統制總會，成立未久，而內部機構，已大部組織就緒，開始辦理移動許可事務。物資統制委員會之名單亦已決定。日商方面之調整動向，亦頗活潑。商業統制總會之下層機構，尙未具體，目下爲準備時期，未有積極活動，關於下層機構之構成，除特殊物資以外，統以中日商界　作爲主旨，自主組織之，日商方面亦以上項辦法爲基準，着手調整。其堪注目之預備工作，有以下數點：　　（一）日商之組合，有濫設傾向，根據一業一組合主義之方針，故有加以整理合併之必要，凡屬一業兩組合以上之組織，將漸次予以合併撤裁，俾可加强效率。　　（二）不分配給，收買界限之組合，必須予以嚴格區別，分別形成單位加入新統制機關。　　（三）希望設一與商業統制總會交涉之機關，作爲批發商界及民間之發言機關。　　（三月二十一日大陸新報）華股同業昨向　經濟局請求登記　　本市一百三十餘家經營華商股票行號，自遵奉當局明令停營業以來，迄已月餘。茲聞多數同業，已遵照當局意旨，首先向工部局呈請頒發准許營業之執照。又昨日由該業周倫棣，張益林，孫文呈，韓繼湘等人，集合各同業，共向特別市經濟局呈請補行登記，冀使該業復業問題之疆局，得以早獲解決。染織業轉催會員辦理單純廠登記　　本市染織業同業公會，前奉江蘇稅務局函令；略爲：「本局組織成立，凡單純織廠之廠號登記事項，應由各該廠號依式塡具書表，檢同附件呈局登記」該會於接得函令後，當經通吿會員遵照辦理。會員中遵辦者固不乏人，惟意存觀望者亦大有人在，故近日該會迭接局方知照，請爲轉行催吿會員，從速辦理。查單純織廠登記，爲染織業紗布移動及運銷之應具手續。該會特分函通吿，凡尙未申請登記之會員，務須到會領取登記表（每份五元）塡就送核，如有不明手續等情，亦可到會詢問。安定金融公債　定期付息　　政府前爲整理舊法幣安定金融，發行安定金融公債十五萬萬元，業於去年六月一日發行，依照條例規定每年付息二次，自發行之日起，每屆六個月付息一次，十年以內祇付利息，自十一年起開始還本。聞第二期付息爲三千七百五十萬元，業經財政部於特種會計收入照還本付息表所定撥存中央儲備銀行該公債基金戶帳以備償付，聞准五月三十一日起由中央儲備銀行十足付息，屆時再由部公吿，俾衆調知。上海年數月來　工商貿易概況　　中央社滬訊　據向金融關係方面獲悉，上海工商貿易情形近數月以來，顯然已轉活潑，其南洋方面雖尙未全部恢復，唯與菲律賓間自菲港物資協定成立後，已有具體辦法，計由滬運菲者爲絲綢，藥材，棉織品等，而由菲運滬者，則爲砂糖，烟葉，以及岷列拉麻等，同時對新加坡方面，已商妥物資交換辦法，議定上海輸出者爲肥皂，火柴，棉布，綢緞等，輸入者爲原料品，如油及橡皮，又滬港之物資貿易恊定，未經訂立，雙方交易之物資，爲上海之棉織品，雜糧，雜貨，以及香港之存糖。　　國內方面　　華中華北間貿易，於本年一月內由雙方同意，將四月中在此早訂立之貿易協定修改一部份，訂立新協定。　　協定要點　　（一）促進雙方物資交流，保持兩地收支均衡；（二）規定以特別圓爲滙兌決算之通貨，但軍票與申滙亦可並用；（三）將貿易協定分爲特定物資貿易，與一般物資貿易兩種。所謂特定物資，由此輸南者爲石炭，硫化鐵鑛生鐵碱粉等，由南輸北者，爲小麥粉砂糖硫酸铔烟草紗布人造絲茶天通草等，所謂一般物資，由北輸南者爲玻璃花生油及其他農產物等，由南輸北者爲紙中藥金屬製品文具肥皂皮類雜貨等。捲煙配給價格　華中公司公佈　黑市一掃而空　　本市捲烟配給事宜，經華中烟公司精極進行後，各項工作，大致業已就緒，本市各大同行烟號，連日紛紛至該公司接洽批購事宜，茲據該公司當局稱：配給捲烟之數量與價格，業已商酌就緒，日內即可公佈，大同行烟號分甲乙兩級；大致甲級配貨較多，其屬下之小同行亦較多，乙級則較少，於配給捲烟發售日起，本市黑市捲烟價格，將一掃而空，各烟號出售之一切捲烟，均須依照公定價格出售與買戶。簡訊　　中央市塲南市地貨出資組合，業已籌備就緒，特於昨（廿二）日下午三時在中央市塲南市塲舉行成立大會，選出理監事二十三人。　　中國工業銀行編行之「中國工業」月刋，第二期業已出版。內容潘　堯之「工業界與金融界之合作」，蔡受百之「援助工業與中國工業銀行」潘吟閣之「民國三十一年之上海金融」等交，由靜安寺路大華路口一〇一〇號該刋發行部發售，預定全年卅元，半年十六元，零售每冊三元。生活必需品的動態　　食糖　　食糖已從十一日起計口授給。食糖的統制配給，在大東亞戰爭一發生後就實行。關於內地販賣，從前就設立一個內地販賣協議會，搬出方面加以統制，但是上海市內，完全自由。　　戰前的食糖市塲，因爲游資都被利用在這裏，所以形成了重要的商品市塲，尤其時戰爭爆發前的三個月，市塲上混亂不堪，連外行人也都挿足其間。　　隨着日美交涉的緊張，各種開戰的謠言蠭起，市價步步高漲，突破三百元，大東亞戰爭一發生，日本軍進駐租界，各項重要物資，都加限制，食糖也在限制之列，一律向軍配組合登記，華商方面從這時候起所登記的，約有○○萬担，華中每年需要的食糖量，大約○○萬担。事前華商方面預料日美要開戰，所以進足食糖，超過一年的需要量。軍配組合接管了租界內的存貨，句括組合的現貨在內，樹立了配給統制計劃，這是在上海統制食糖的起始。　　因之新設了一所上海糖商合作社，作爲華商方面的配給機關，所有華商方面的有力商號，全都加入，日方的配給機關，不另設置，就委託食料品商業組合代爲統制配給，規定白糖爲日金七角一分一斤，配給數量，中日兩方都未經規定，應時令的需要，隨時增减，施以富有彈力性的統制配給。　　開始統制到現在，已經過一年，其間在統制上沒有什麼變遷，不過價格上有點上落，去年六月跌至日金六角八分一斤，同年九月，又回漲到日金七角八分。去年十一月左右，外間都傳說存底枯竭，將施行憑票授給制，虹口方面也可以看到排列店門口購糖的一字長蛇陣，到後來宣佈了存量充沛，方始解除了擠購風潮，總算沒有發生特別黑市，比了火柴，香烟，肥皂等好得多了。食糖統制的所以比較順利，第—因爲它的存貨比別種商品豐足，其次，就是華商都能積栩協力，沒有絲毫不願意的樣子。　　據軍配組合當局談，本月十一日起實施計口授給制，可以限定消費，這是戰時生活的應當措置，並非存貨减少的原故。　　本年度的食糖，大約從查港，台灣有相當數量可來，今後和南方的交易，也能恢復，食糖供應，無虞匱乏。（三月十九日大陸新報）</h3>

<p>自由談關於「人生缺陷」的理解  徐玉璋　　處身在　個動盪的時代裏，生活高壓的領域中，不論貧賤富貴，恐怕誰都潛伏着一種「缺陷」的暗影吧。我們祗要看這社會上，終日熙熙攘攘，鈎心鬥角地爲自己設法「撈進」用資「彌補」的演出，就是一個明證。　　其實，這種「缺陷」的根苗，不自今日生，人類有生以來，就孕育着缺陷」的胚胎。惟其有「缺陷」，人類纔能繼續不斷地演進。以達兩文的「人類進化論」說，「缺陷」便是進取的逮徑。假使在石器時代裏的人，感覺到宇宙賦予的一切事物，都已「滿足」而無缺陷」的話，那麼，我們說不定會退化到原始時代，做着現代的野蠻人呢。何來偉大的民族，昌明的文化？所以運用合理的方式，完成缺陷」至滿足的「前途」，原爲人類迫切所需要的。可是，人類中根多歪曲了它的定義，走上了「自私」的蹊徑，運用了「巧取」和「榨取」的方式來滿足他的「缺陷」，甚至爲欲滿足一時的「缺陷」而不　手段的。　　人類有着一雙天賦仲屈靈活的「手」，具備着一萬物之　」的「腦」，自可「手腦並進」向着一取之無禁，用之不竭」的大自然境界裏拓荒，發掘你所需要的—不論精神與物質，滿足你的「缺陷」，何用窮兇極惡地「巧取豪壽」啊！　　據說人類在畢生的過程中，一直過着矛盾的生活，永遠佔有「缺陷」的暗影；譬如有了「飽」還想「暖」，「飽」「暖」兼備，還想「淫慾」……雖經天演地變，矢志不渝。所以「人生『的「缺陷」，是無法「滿足」的。　　然而，這種論調，也是偏見，如果人類充分理解了「人生缺陷」中的眞性，具備着一進取」的前進思想，運用孔子所說：「節用而愛人」的方式，取得合理的「滿足」，這個世問就不會像目前那樣凄慘了。談「愛的教育」  寄塵　　在這五方雜處的大都市裏，一切的一切，都給「財」蒙蔽了。人們看見的是錢和比錢更値價的貨物，聽到的是關於「財」的一切。談到敎育，那是很掃興的，除非是淸寒的敎育界人士，與一般高等知識階級者，是沒人會來體昧你的話的。　　敎育，在一班庸俗人的眼裏，以爲是像貨物一樣，可以拿錢購買的。只消繳淸了費，把子女往學校一送，不就完事了嗎？可是不。敎育是需由家裏開始的。本文就是談在家庭裏的，關於「愛」的敎育。　　理論上的敎育，在目前雖然一時不易實行，然而實際的，與兒童將來前途有關的敎育。却不容　們忽視。　　所以鮑歇博士說：「當你的孩子們年幼之時，你使應訓　他們，使他們變成正　，機變和敏捷」　　訓練孩子，我們先得有耐心，徐徐導引他走入正路。如果再三數决後不能見效，已覺得心灰意懶，那麼，你便失敗了。　　在家庭　，　們得特別注意下列數點：（一）兒童日常閱讀書本的良莠。（二）不要冷淡孩子。（三）啟發兒意的興趣。（四）注意其平時所交的友伴。（五）鼓勵其參加集體生活。（六）切不做不良的榜樣。（七）注意其談吐舉止。　　在每一種錯誤第一次發覺的時候，我們便應該立刻去糾正它。因爲每一種不良的言行，都是從小養成的。我們絕不能因爲兒童年歲尙小爲藉口，而使家庭敎育受到很大的阻礙。並且我們尤其不能因溺愛而任意放縱。　　通常，我們極不易自覺溺愛，而祇覺得這是一種合乎情理的正當愛。不料，却無形地害了我們的孩子。這是一件與國家前途極有關係的事，須努力設法糾正。　　偶然在一家照相館的櫥窗裏，看見一幀活潑可愛的小孩照片，上面有四個字：不要吻我。這句話並不是沒有根據的。因爲小孩的疾病，大多從這種視似愛的行爲裏染傳而得，而凡是爲母親的，又大都易犯這種無心的錯誤。或許，孩子就因此而喪失了他的小生命。這是何等危險的事。　　關於種種因「愛」而發生的錯誤，因限於篇輻，不一一細談了。反正，關於這一方面的書籍，各圖書館裏備有都很豐富。爲國家的前途計，爲自己孩子的前途計，我們不妨在百忙中抽暇，借幾木回家看看，糾正我們巳往的錯誤。根  辛波　　「哪，老根，拿了去，洋錢都是好的，要小信，你不妨一塊一塊敲敲看。』　　「黃老爺府上出來的洋錢會有壞的麼。』根明說着，依然將原有的舊報紙包了起來，痙攣着面孔，抖着手，塞進了襯衫袋長。　　『阿五，阿五，」黃崇菴叫着「　酒，將夜飯端出來。』　　在阿五答應聲中，根明就對黃崇菴吿辭：『謝謝黃老爺，使我們一家可以安然過年。」聲音裏有一些冷意，又回過來對楊子傑和兪篤周說：「明大在街上我請二位喝酒。」這話中却含着一些熱誠。　　「還有我呢？」陸柏梀伸手攔着根明，他聽見燙酒，已經完全淸醒了。　　「你麼，明天請你在吳老四的店裏等我。」　　根明一到廳上，阿五芷從東面一間屋子裏定出來，便說。。『老根伯，你回去了麼？』待我點了燈籠送你出去，屋子裏很黑，你又陌生，沒有亮是不大好走的。』　　在根明的遜謝聲中，阿五點好了燈籠，然後二人走入了天井，進入了西首的屋子；然後由此向北，一進一進地走出去。共有五進，每進都空着，不住人。　　『聽聽你那樣的話，我很難過，』阿五提着燈籠，在前面說：「有錢的人都趁沒有良心的！……」　　「唉，誰叫你沒有錢呢！』根明在後面嘆着氣。二月份徵文錄取第二名　怎樣讀書，講什麼書？　（下）  應源澤　　怎樣求博　　求博當用「涉　法」，這是無疑的；但是「涉涉覽法不能一蹴而幾，須在幼年隨時加以培養，俾能養成習慣，習慣旣經養成，以後對於無論什麼書，都能把它涉覽一過了。這極讀法的要點是集中讀者的注意力，利用敏銳的視覺和理解力，很快的把一書的數章讀過，或選讀其中的重要部分，而略去其不重要的。最緊要的是能明　該書思想的綫索，或其內容的大概，以免胡亂混讀的弊害。此外讀者須多方利用片段時間，對於要讀的書又須預先規定决序，以免凌亂無序，或徒耗光陰。　　自廣義言之，主要的讀書法不外乎「求精」和「求博」種，此外許多枝枝節節的讀書法，非屬於「求精」，即屬於「求博」，因限於篇幅，未能一一枚舉了。　　（二）讀什麼書？　　我們旣知道怎樣讀書，接踵而起的問題便是「讀什麼書？」這個問題和第一個問題有密切的關係，因爲，如果我們不知道要讀什麼書，那又何必先談讀書的方法呢？　　選書標準　　世界上可烟海，同時人生中可以供讀書的時間又如此其短少，這樣，要在有限的時間中讀畢許多有益的書籍，唯一的方法是知道怎樣選書；但選畫不是一件容易的事，選書而欲『頭頭是道一：——有百益而無一害——最好在事前規定幾個選書的標準，以作選書時的實際指導。茲按愚見所及，依决略述比較最重要的三點，以供讀者參考：　　（一）須能增進我們的基本知識——道一類書，包括社會，經濟，政治，科學，哲學，史地，和常識等，而報章和雜誌，也屬於這一類。　　（二）須有益於個人的修養——這一類書，包括名人傳記和隨筆，詩歌和小說，倫理和道德，以及立身處世，人格修養之類。　　（三）須對於謀生有直接的貢獻——如職業，技術，工業，將藥，法雜，理化，或語言等，都屬於這一類。它們對於個人所從事的職業，均有直接簡接的關係，它們不是理論書，而是工具書。　　筆者匕提出幾個關於選書的標準，但如果對於實際的書自毫無建議，那也於理不合。至於第三項所包含的工具書，因其範圍過廣，祗得從略了。社會服務咳嗽吐痰患者注意  楊郁生　　近來天時忽冷忽熱，患咳嗽者很多。咳嗽可分：（一）乾性咳嗽，如喉頭發炎，氣管炎，肋膜炎，初期結核，心臓疾病，胃炎，婦人懷娠等皆有咳，然咳嗽而無痰，不必吃化痰藥。（二）濕性咳嗽，如氣管支漏，肺膿瘍，肺壞疽，要檢騐痰液，診查其何種病症，方可擇藥。（三）大吠聲咳嗽，咳聲像犬吠，有長聲，如小孩患白喉（傳染病），百日咳（俗　鷺　咳）因其咳聲特別，不能照普通治法治之。（四）發作性咳嗽，有一陣一陣的咳嗽，如小孩患喉蛾（即扁桃腺腫），流行性感冒，喉咽有病，氣管支病及神經性病，亦要加以辨別。（五）　嚮性咳嗽，咳聲如鳴缶打壺之聲，其聲空空然，咳聲與胸內空氣共鳴，或有氣胸。（六）小咳，很輕微的咳，倒也不可輕看，或係上氣道慢性加答兄，或係初期肺癆。（七）無聲的作咳，咳而　聲，如神經性的喜思得慮」Hystsria或其聲帶麻痺。　　此外，如小兒氣管的淋巴腺腫脹，或因耳內盯　充塞之刺激，或因腸內有寄生蟲所引起之反應，須請醫師鑑別。咳出的痰亦有種種，有粘液痰，有鐵銹　痰，有臭氣的痰，有泡沬樣痰，有血絲血點的痰。咳的時間有不同，有朝醒時咳，有臨睡時咳。至於止咳藥，不可亂買，因藥有種種，有抑止性，有刺激性，有溶解性，要看病情如何而定。關於病情疑難，上海聖母院路友助醫社敝同人可義務解答。敬誠診所施診　　敬誠平民施診所，爲一指禪推拿名醫黃一照主辦送診貧病，一切男婦各症，均所擅長，時間每日上午八至十一時，診所成都路二十一衖二號，電話三二九七三。收款報告　　（一）小本貸金：王朱英五百元，結存八千三百九十元。（二）小學敎師醫藥助金：鮑國昌一千元，義球三輪車夫（六名一天中所得酒資）三十三元，謝燕翼一百元，共收一千一百三十三元，結存四萬五千四百七十一元。</p>

<h3>On the Way to National Prosperity and Strength</h3>
<p>The relationship between participation in the war, national construction and industrial development, and politics and diplomacy, along with the expectations of the people, has been discussed in detail in the previous two commentaries. We believe that China's participation in the war is to seek the liberation of China and defend East Asia; the prerequisite for this is a strong China, otherwise it is all just empty talk. There are many aspects that China needs to work on to become strong, and the most important is the improvement of the national economic life.</p>
<p>China's past mistake was the failure to complete industrialization. In the future, the government and the people should work towards this goal; it is also hoped that friendly nations will provide full assistance in terms of tools, capital, talent, and technology. Because if China is not industrialized, the economic life of the people cannot be improved, China cannot become prosperous and strong, and Japan will bear too much unilateral responsibility. China has a vast territory, and the economic backgrounds of different regions are not entirely the same. Some are naturally suitable for agriculture, and some can only promote animal husbandry; but today, in the peaceful areas, most are suitable for modern industry. Even industrial animal husbandry should be regarded as a process of developing towards industrialization, and not as the final goal. In today's general economic life of the world, due to the increasing shortening of transportation distances, countries must communicate with each other and become one. The ideal of friendly nations is to help each other with resources and share what they have and don’t have, which is absolutely reasonable and close to reality. Our country's foreign economic policy is also based on this ideal, and we are willing to give as well as receive from all friendly countries. Therefore, we advocate that China should take industrialization as its goal, and today we should step up the confirmation of fundamental economic policies to lay the foundation for future national construction and industrial development. Our main work should focus on: (1) Conducting a thorough survey of national resources, which of them we are rich in and can share with friendly nations; which of them we own but lack capital, talent, and technology, and should jointly develop and utilize with friendly nations. Which of them are lacking in friendly nations but we are rich in, and can supply in large quantities. (2) Studying which regions have which specialties and are suitable for which industries, and all should be subject to comprehensive planning, thorough research, and proper allocation. (3) Now that countries should share what they have and don’t have and give full play to their strengths, the internal regions of our country should also exchange what they have and don’t have. The concept of boundaries between North China, Central China, and South China should be completely eliminated. (4) Our country has a vast land and abundant resources, and the government and the people should cooperate sincerely. For those that do not require government leadership, the people should be given ample opportunity to develop their strength. Furthermore, the scope of the economy is extremely broad, and the government should take charge of the overall economic situation today, formulate financial plans, and not lightly determine major economic plans for the convenience of finance. During the period of participation in the war, national expenses will inevitably be vast, and the government cannot but focus on finance, but in the future, the scope of financial facilities should be determined based on the interests of the national economy and the national economy, and it must achieve "making the best use of the land and the people," and then there will be hope for "national prosperity and strength."</p>
<p>Economy, politics, diplomacy, transportation, etc., are all closely related. To make the country prosperous and strong from the economic aspect and fulfill the responsibility of participating in the war during the war, it is necessary to comprehensively improve politics, universally improve political integrity, thoroughly realize streamlined administration, strengthen the diplomatic lineup, and seek closer cooperation with friendly nations. And the economy is more closely related to transportation. In the past, because the local areas were not completely pacified, the public and private lives suffered from the inconvenience of transportation, which can be described as deeply traumatizing. Fortunately, various places have gradually returned to normal, then if we want to talk about developing the economy in the future, we must first rectify transportation. If we can achieve smooth flow of goods with sincere cooperation between China and Japan, it will not only be convenient for both the public and private sectors, but also beneficial to the interests of China and Japan. Railways and highways are hoped to be utilized more rationally, while waterway transportation should also be fully developed in Central China, South China, and some provinces in North China. At the same time, improve and increase various auxiliary means of transportation, and strive to make every stream that can be navigated a place for ships to weave, and every road that can be rolled by wheels a place for vehicles to converge, then the meridians will be connected, and economic development will surely "achieve twice the result with half the effort." As for coastal and overseas transportation, all those that are helpful to the unification of South China, Central China, and North China, and those that are conducive to the connection between China, Japan, Manchukuo, and various places in Nanyang, are also hoped that Chinese and Japanese experts will jointly study and plan, and the government should also plan as early as possible. In short, China's prosperity and strength is the main stabilizing force for liberating China and defending East Asia. Not only our country, but also friendly people, should also give more encouragement and assistance.</p>
<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3>The Seven-Ocean Navy and the Relations Between Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox once stated in the House of Representatives: "If the United States only has a two-ocean navy, it will not be able to meet the needs. It must be equipped with a large navy sufficient to control the seven oceans of the world." Competing with this proposition was the boast of Secretary of War Stimson not long after, who said: "By the end of 1943, we will have an army of 8.2 million, and this plan is not to build a defensive army, but to take an immediate offensive, because we must seize the good opportunity that has arrived and end the war in the shortest possible time." In this way, the two authorities of the sea and land competed to publish their huge plans to incite their people. Needless to say, it was just a clumsy strategy to deceive their deep worries about defeat with fictitious numbers.</p>
<p>In particular, Knox, he is not only dreaming of building a seven-ocean navy, but also making such arrogant remarks on the practical issues: "The United States has built twice as many battleships as it has lost in the Pacific waters since the start of the war. Therefore, in March, we will give Japan a major blow." Even if the repeated announcements of the U.S. Navy authorities boasting about the rapid progress of their shipbuilding projects can be fully believed, the number of battleships commissioned since the start of the war is only four Washington-class ships and two ships entering the water. As for aircraft carriers and cruisers, there are very few. Comparing this with Japan's great achievements—sinking eleven battleships, eleven aircraft carriers, fifty-seven cruisers, and fifty-four destroyers—the ships they have built are not enough to replenish even half of them. What the U.S. Navy publishes is often used to deceive its people to avoid the responsibility for its defeat, but the cold numbers prove it without any regret.</p>
<p>However, what can be called a farce here is that Britain, which relies on the military build-up of the United States, fights with weapons made in the United States, and welcomes the U.S. troops dispatched to the mainland with food and drinks, is also greatly disturbed by Knox's delirium and reveals suspicious emotions. Needless to say, the recent hardening trend of British public opinion towards the United States is not only manifested because of the seven-ocean navy. A few days ago, British Colonial Secretary Stanley gave a speech at Oxford University, saying that the West Indies, which Britain leased to the United States in exchange for fifty destroyers, constitutes the territory of the British Empire. In response, U.S. Vice President Wallace and Undersecretary of State Welles simultaneously stated: "The temporary military bases set up in Central and South America will of course be returned when the war ends, but the bases outside the Americas belong to us," thereby implying the permanent occupation of the West Indies. In particular, Senator Miller Tydings once made such arrogant remarks: "Britain must first declare the transfer of the leased islands as an absolute condition for revising the Military Lending Act."</p>
<p>In this way, just as an atmosphere of unease was brewing in British political circles, the U.S. United Press reported the countermeasure news that the United States now intends to appoint New York Mayor La Guardia as the Governor-General of North Africa for the inauguration of British North African Resident Minister Macmillan. Of course, the Washington authorities remained silent on this news from the Associated Press, but that silence made Britain feel unhappy. Therefore, it is inevitable that the public opinion is hardened because the United States has the ambition to occupy North Africa.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union have different dreams in the same bed, but where is the future of British-American coordination? At this time, the war is in full swing, and the struggle between the snipe and the clam can be said to be the inevitable fate of the imperialist war in the end.

<p>Various Countries Will Return Soon</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegram: The Beijing Legation Quarter was established in 1901 based on the Boxer Rebellion. It is a rectangular area about 1,200 meters long from east to west and about 65 meters wide from north to south, with an area of about 200 acres. It is commonly known as Dongjiaomin Lane. The countries with treaty relations include eleven countries, including Japan, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Hungary, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union. According to the treaty, the Qing government recognized that the area where each country was located was for the use of the legations of each country, and the police power in the same area was attributed to the legations of each country. The Chinese people had no right to reside, and the area was recognized as an armed zone of each country. Therefore, the situation in the area at that time had become a special administrative area. Chinese people, except for the employees of the legations, had no right to reside. All administration was subject to the instructions of the chairman of the diplomatic corps of the countries. Our country has repeatedly wanted to recover this special area, but because the relationship is complicated, it has not been realized for a while. Today, Austria and Hungary, which were treaty countries at that time, have disappeared. The rights and interests of the United Kingdom and the United States have also been declared abandoned by the National Government when our country participated in the war. Japan has first recognized that our country has recovered the area, so it is expected that other related countries will also return it to the National Government.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu's Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegram: After the Chinese and Japanese authorities signed the clauses and understandings on the Beijing Legation Quarter, the Foreign Minister made a special statement. The original text is recorded below. After our country and Japan signed the detailed clauses on the return of the Japanese-controlled concessions on the 14th of this month, the implementation clauses on the recovery of the Beijing Legation Quarter were signed today, and it was also stipulated that they would be implemented on the 30th of this month, which is the anniversary of the return of the capital. It can be seen that Japan is actively fulfilling its promises.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Beijing Legation Quarter began in 1901. In the name of self-defense, it implemented monopolistic administration, which was a bad example in the international community. Although the area of the area is small, it is like an enemy. This special state has been established for more than 40 years. Now, due to the change of circumstances, the reason for its existence has long disappeared. Our country has wanted to recover its administrative rights for a long time. Because the relationship is more complicated, it has been delayed until now and has not been successful. The friendly country Japan, in order to assist our country's independent development, not only returned all its exclusive concessions, but also first agreed to our country's recovery of the Legation Quarter. Its enthusiasm and determination to assist our country are deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>Since Germany and other countries recognized the National Government last year, the European countries have taken the same steps one after another and sent diplomats to reside in our country one after another. The friendly relations are improving day by day. Since our country participated in the war on January 9 this year, the relationship with allied Japan and friendly European countries has become closer. In order to eliminate the obstacles to political and economic development and complete independence and autonomy, our country must recover the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. Although the Legation Quarter is not a concession, the organization of its autonomous administrative organs is similar to that of the concessions. Now our country is determined to recover it, and the friendly country Japan first agrees, and the implementation clauses have been signed today, and the content is appropriate, and can be used as a model. It is thought that other related countries can accept it in the same way. Now our country is seeking to increase its friendship with various countries that have established normal diplomatic relations. The special state of the above-mentioned Legation Quarter really has no reason to exist. It is expected that other related countries can agree with our country's claim to recover it. Now our country is discussing this issue with related countries and many have expressed their agreement. Moreover, it can be seen that the friendly spirit of these countries. After the technical details are agreed upon, the recovery can be fully implemented. And it is deeply believed that the friendly relations between our country and the friendly countries will be further enhanced without a doubt.</p>

The general idea is as follows: "The return of the Beijing Legation Quarter is the elimination of the last legacy of the era when Britain, the United States, and the powers divided China. It has epoch-making significance for China's autonomy and independence. The Japanese government first recognized China's recovery of the administrative rights of the area on January 9 this year, and according to the agreement of this month, the Japanese administrative rights will be returned to China on the anniversary of the return of the National Government this year. As for the enemy countries of Britain and the United States among the contracting countries of the Legation Quarter, the National Government declared the abandonment of the treaty after participating in the war, so the issue has been resolved. Regarding the remaining countries, the National Government is currently discussing the recovery policy."</p>

The Chongqing army's attempt to counter-attack was completely crushed.

<p>Moji, 22nd - Central News Agency: Four Soviet crew members of the freighter "Kola," which was sunk by a torpedo in the East China Sea on February 17, were rescued by a Japanese ship and left Shimonoseki for Tokyo yesterday. They had been drifting in a lifeboat for 17 days until they were rescued by a Japanese ship south of Kyushu on March 5. They expressed extreme hatred for the United States. It is said that when they felt the torpedo explode, although they could not identify the attacker, they later pondered the time and place of the incident and were convinced that the ship that sunk them was an American submarine. In our desperation, we are now able to regain our health and are on our way home. It is truly like a dream. We were exhausted when we were rescued, and we are deeply grateful to the Japanese warship for providing medical care, entertainment, and clothing.</p>
<h3>Italian Consulate Established in Saigon</h3>
<p>Saigon, 22nd - Central News Agency: Italian Consul Maleri was previously ordered to come to Saigon to prepare for the establishment of the Italian Consulate. Now that all preparations have been completed, it has been officially announced today that it has been established and has begun operations. It is reported that Italy will also establish a consulate in Hanoi in the near future.</p>
<h3>Hitler Announces to the People He Will Never Discuss Peace Again; Number of German Soldiers Killed in This War Only One-Quarter of That in Previous World War</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: Thousands of Berlin residents witnessed the demeanor of Fuehrer Hitler and Marshal Goering yesterday, which is enough to prove that Goebbels' statement to the press a few days ago that the British and American rumors that the German Fuehrer was ill were completely untrue. Although the wrinkles on the German Fuehrer's face have increased compared to before, he is full of energy and shows no signs of illness. The war in the past three and a half years has made Fuehrer Hitler's face more solemn and his voice more serious. Fuehrer Hitler's speech yesterday was delivered in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army. From a political point of view, he still adheres to the viewpoint he adopted on November 8 last year. He announced to the people, "We will never discuss peace again. The day this war ends will also be the day when the countries that join hands with the Bolsheviks collapse, and the British Empire will also collapse as a result of its crimes." Fuehrer Hitler then severely criticized Churchill's policies, which are completely opposed to the German foreign policy elaborated in his book "Mein Kampf." Regarding the new order in Europe, which has been discussed extensively recently, the German Fuehrer did not directly mention it yesterday, probably because yesterday's speech was of a military nature. The Fuehrer continued, saying that the crisis on the Eastern Front had been safely passed, and all restrictions on the soldiers on the front line had been lifted. Hitler finally announced that the number of German soldiers killed was 542,000. In order to show the accuracy of this figure, he compared it with the losses of the German army in the First World War. According to the four and a half years of the First World War, the losses of the German army were 2,036,897, plus the losses of Germans in the Austro-Hungarian army were 420,000. The number of German losses in this three-and-a-half-year war is only a quarter of that in the First World War. This is because the losses of the German army were extremely small at the beginning of the German-Soviet war.</p>
<h3>Churchill Speech: Post-War Plan; Believes War Will Be Protracted</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd - Allied News Agency: British Prime Minister Churchill gave a radio address last night, saying briefly: Some people think the war will end soon. I am really unable to be so optimistic. In fact, the war may be delayed for another year or even two. Therefore, it is foolish to discuss the issue of national borders while this war is in full swing. Churchill then explained his four-year post-war plan, such as guaranteeing unemployment, national health, and universal education. However, post-war taxes will be heavier than before.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: London Telegraph, British Prime Minister Churchill gave a radio speech last night, briefly outlining the plan to create a European Parliament. His words were brief: This organization should become a powerful alliance that can enforce its resolutions through national or international forces. In addition to the great powers, all small countries should also join it, but it should be premised on meeting the interests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. But it is the act of fools to discuss post-war issues and disputed boundaries at this time. Churchill continued, the Beveridge Plan is a four-year plan to improve social conditions and avoid repeating the mistakes of 25 years ago. Churchill ended by saying, the British Eighth Army has now launched an offensive in North Africa.</p>
<p>German Commentary</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: An important official of the German Foreign Ministry told Fischer, a foreign affairs reporter of Haitong News Agency, Churchill's announcement of the post-war plan clearly wants to eliminate the negative impression of the British press's criticism of Poland's territorial demands on the Soviet Union. However, Churchill's plan does not guarantee the people of Poland and the Baltic countries. Churchill believes that a group of small countries can stop Bolshevization, but he has forgotten the failure of the League of Nations' collective security mechanism. Churchill's four-year plan to improve social conditions seems progressive to backward Britons, but in Germany, this problem has long been solved. In order to please the conservatives, Churchill stated that there is still room for personal automatic development under the planned economy. Churchill warned the British people about the war situation that victory is still difficult to achieve, and the Allies have very few chances of winning this year.</p>

<h3>German Army Launches Fierce Attack on Upper Donets; War Situation Enters Emergency Stage; Soviet Union Admits Loss of Belgrade</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd - Allied News Agency: The Kharkov-Belgorod Railway on the Eastern Front has now completely fallen into the hands of the German army, and the German army is launching a fierce counter-offensive to the east and northeast on a broad front. According to Reuters from Moscow, the Southern Soviet army's offensive is strengthening, and Moscow is quite anxious. The German army is attacking Yuguev, 30 kilometers southeast of Kharkov, with particular ferocity. This move is enough to threaten the right wing of the Red Army along the Voroshilovgrad-Rostov line, and even its rear. German aircraft are heavily bombing the Donets line, and large-scale air battles occur every day. The Soviet side has strengthened its special air force, as well as infantry, tanks, and artillery.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: A message from the British visitor in Moscow claimed that the battle in the Upper Donets region has entered an emergency stage. German tank forces had breached Togoyev yesterday morning, and Soviet forces were forced to retreat twice to new positions in the past 24 hours. The Soviet-held bridgehead west of Izium on the west bank of the Donets was also under fierce attack by the German army.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 22nd - Havas News Agency: The focus of the war situation on the Eastern Front is still in the South today. The Soviet Union issued a communique last night admitting that the city of Belgrade had fallen. According to German sources today, the German army continued to make progress on the upper reaches of the Donets River. A German communique also stated that the section of the Donets River from the city of Belgrade to the city of Kharkov is now completely under the control of the German army. The Red Army has transferred reinforcements from other war zones to the Donets River front line. A message from Moscow stated that the war situation there is very "critical." In Berlin, it is said that the Red Army's repeated counter-offensives have been repelled. According to the latest news from Moscow, the Red Army is now guarding the Donets River line southeast of the city of Kharkov, and the pressure is increasing, especially in the Chuguev area where fierce fighting is taking place. To the north, the German army, which occupied the city of Seversk, is intensifying its pressure on the city of Kursk, because this is the Red Army's last stronghold on the Orel-Kharkov railway. According to German sources, the Red Army in the Orel area has stopped its offensive, probably because the Red Army has suffered too many casualties in that area, or perhaps the Red Army in that area had to be transferred to other areas for combat, which is also possible.</p>
<p>Soviet Army Launches Offensive on Northern Route; Polotzk Heavily Bombed by German Aircraft</p>
<p>22nd - Havas News Agency: As for the war situation in the central route, there is actually no change. The Red Army continues to attack the city of Dorogobuzh, while the German army continues to counter-attack south of the city of Bely, without success. The Soviet side announced that the Red Army had recovered several locations in the central route, including the Vardino station. At present, the Red Army is fighting on the west bank of the upper reaches of the Dnieper River. Soviet General Timoshenko has also launched an offensive north of Lake Ilmen, but it does not seem to have made progress. The German defenses are solid, and they are resolutely resisting everywhere.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: Responsible officials here announced last night that on the night of the 20th, Soviet aircraft had heavily bombed a Soviet airfield west of Bologoye. Bologoye is located northwest of Moscow, at the intersection of the Leningrad-Moscow railway and the Pskov-Rybinsk railway. At that time, several buildings at the airfield were hit and caught fire.</p>
<h3>Diplomats Gather in Washington; Speculation About Eden's Mission to the United States</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Ambassador to the United States Halifax returned to Washington today from New York. Chongqing's Ambassador to the United Kingdom Gu Weijun, US Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss, and Chongqing's military attache to the United States arrived in Miami, Florida today by plane from Chongqing.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: A report from the Swedish Daily News in London stated that there are many different speculations as to what Eden's mission to the United States is, but one point is generally the same: the United States' views on post-war policy are different from those of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. It is only natural that Eden is attempting to persuade the United States to adopt the same position as the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>British Military Delegation to the Soviet Union; Martel Appointed Leader</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: According to news from London, the British War Office announced that Lieutenant General Martel has been appointed leader of the British delegation to the Soviet Union, succeeding General Miles. Martel is a tank expert who has written books on tanks, which have been translated into Russian. In 1936, Martel visited Moscow with General Wavell. After the outbreak of the European war, he served as commander of the 58th Infantry Division and participated in the Dunkirk battle.</p>
<h3>Elite British and American Troops Begin Action; Major Battle Unfolds in Tunisia; Northern Coastal Area Occupied by Axis Forces</h3>
<p>Fuehrer Headquarters, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: Today's German military report stated that elite British and American troops in southern and central Tunisia have launched a major offensive. Fierce fighting is taking place on both land and air fronts.</p>
<p>Rome, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that the hard battle in Tunisia is progressing. Yesterday, after heavy artillery bombardment, Allied forces launched a fierce attack on the central and southern sectors. Axis air forces participated in the battle, attacking enemy transport lines and advancing troops. Italian aircraft bombed Bone Harbor and Bougie Harbor, and the enemy suffered losses. Italian torpedo planes attacked enemy ships anchored in Algiers Harbor last night, sinking one 10,000-ton ship, setting a medium-sized vessel on fire, and hitting two other ships.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: According to news received here last night from the North African front, German and Italian joint forces continued to advance in northern Tunisia. The entire coastal area as far as the Alag River, 20 kilometers northeast of Tabarka, has been occupied by Axis forces. The Tabarka-Béja coastal road used by the British Eighth Army to transport supplies has now been cut off. The section of the road that crosses the high ground of Abi Woode has also been occupied by Axis tank forces. The Axis forces have captured a great deal of spoils of war in this campaign and captured more than 2,000 enemy troops. Allied forces launched an offensive in central and southern Tunisia on the evening of the 20th, but no major battle has yet taken place. In southern Tunisia, the US 1st Armored Division has advanced eastward from Gafsa, with the apparent goal of reaching the Mediterranean coast and flanking General Rommel's tank forces. The British Eighth Army is advancing northeast in the central sector, but German aircraft are active and have made their progress very difficult.</p>
<h3>Greek Government Moves to Cairo</h3>
<p>Ankara, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: After the news that the Greek government-in-exile has moved from London to Cairo, diplomatic circles here are paying close attention. Responsible officials in Ankara predict that the Allies will take military action in the eastern Mediterranean, and this is the first sign. In the past, before the British army attacked Abyssinia, Negus was taken to East Africa, which can serve as a lesson.</p>
<p>Ankara, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: The Turkish military delegation sent to the Tunisian border has a total of 12 members, led by Generals Womultak and Noyan. They took a US plane south. It is heard that Eisenhower and Giraud will entertain them.</p>
<h3>International Briefs: General Giraud Travels to North Africa</h3>
<p>Ankara, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: General Giraud flew from Beirut to Algiers today to participate in a meeting with Tegel and Giraud to mediate.</p>
<p>Tangier, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: The "Tangier Echo" fought and said that General Tegel is still hesitating about whether to go to Algiers, because Algiers has abolished the laws promulgated by Roche and appointed General Giraud as the leader.</p>
<p>Tangier, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: Algiers news, French Minister to Finland Ganlin has now joined the Giraud faction. Ganlin has long since left his post in Helsinki.</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Exchange Prisoners with Britain</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 23rd - Central News Agency: According to a cable from Ankara, Germany, Italy, and Britain exchanged prisoners, which began on the morning of the 22nd at Mersin Port, southwest of Adana, Turkey.</p>
<h3>Overview of German Arms Production</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: According to the manager of a German arms factory, the number of bombs produced at the same time is now four times higher than before the outbreak of the European war. The amount of steel required to manufacture a 250 kg bomb is now 70 kg less than before, the number of other part workers has been reduced to one-fifth, and the amount of power consumed has also been reduced by 88 percent. 78 percent of the factory's employees are foreigners, and 80 percent of them live near the factory.</p>
<h3>Indian Poetess Naidu Released</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: The Indian poetess Naidu, who was arrested for almost two years, has been ordered to be released by the authorities due to serious illness.</p>
<h3>Air Combat Roundtable Between Japan and the US - Continued - From Air Raid Routes to Various Defense Methods</h3>
<p>Why Doesn't Japan Have an Aviation Ministry? Both Japan and the US Have Separate Army and Navy Air Forces.</p>
<p>Reporter: Now let's talk more about the possibility of establishing an aviation ministry. Has the question of establishing an aviation ministry been raised a long time ago?</p>
<p>Fujita: This question is not within the military scope. It doesn't refer to an Air Force Ministry. Does it refer to the Air Force? Is it intended to change the Aviation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications into a ministry?</p>
<p>Reporter: It refers to the Air Force.</p>
<p>Fujita: Does that mean wanting to separate the Air Force from the Army and Navy?</p>
<p>Reporter: Logically, that's what it means.</p>
<p>Fujita: I think it's better for Japan to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>Oonishi: Because the tasks are different.</p>
<p>Fujita: Although the independence of the Air Force has developed smoothly in foreign countries, it is better for Japan to remain as it is now.</p>
<p>Oonishi: Perhaps only Japan and the United States have aviation in the naval aspect in particular. This is because Japan and the United States must wage war in the Pacific. This is the reason why the naval aspect has a special air force. Sometimes the British Air Force is independent, sometimes attached to other departments, but now it seems that it is not attached to the Army and Navy. Perhaps the Air Force is unified.</p>
<p>Fujita: It's not like that now.</p>
<p>Oonishi: At first, the air force of the Army and the Navy was divided, because each had special tasks. If they are not divided like this, I think that the strengths of both sides will be erased in the future.</p>
<p>Nakajima: It seems that it is better to keep the status quo, as His Excellency Oonishi has pointed out.</p>
<p>Oonishi: But there is no intention to merge the air forces of the Army and Navy into an independent Air Force Ministry at present.</p>
<p>Honne: Some people say that the status quo also has difficulties, and Germany has an independent air force department, so our country can be changed to an independent one. Although there is this faction, I think that foreign countries have special circumstances, and Japan has special circumstances. It is right for foreign countries to change to an independent Air Force Ministry, but it is not necessarily right for Japan.</p>
<p>Oonishi: German aircraft are all land-based aircraft. When the Bismarck battleship was sunk before, although the aircraft flew to assist, they did not find the battlefield and flew back. This is because there is no habit of flying at sea. In short, if maritime training is not conducted with the fleet, no results can be achieved no matter what.</p>
<p>Honne: Generally speaking, although the ocean is wide, navigation seems easy, but it is actually very difficult.</p>
<p>Oonishi: Although ships sailing in the sea are very wide and it seems that they are not easy to collide with each other, in fact, they sometimes collide with each other, even to the point of sinking.</p>
<p>Honne: Even if you pay attention to looking ahead in your own direction, you still need technical skills.</p>
<p>Oonishi: The sea surface is different from the land, and there is no need to "stop" such trouble, but navigation still requires considerable training.</p>
<p>Reporter: Let's go back to the previous question and please teach us about how military aircraft will develop.</p>
<p>Oonishi: That's the stratosphere I just talked about.</p>
<p>Reporter: Stratosphere and long distance problems have been mentioned before, but please teach us more.</p>
<p>Okada: Stratosphere flight is when flying in, but when bombing, it is in the air at 10,000 meters. In short, if you don't fly low, it is very difficult to drop bombs on the target.</p>
<p>Matsuura: Can the platform for bombing large cities be bombed from high altitude?</p>
<p>Okada: Isn't it written at 4,000 meters in "Essentials of Air Defense"? If bombing at an altitude higher than this, it will make people on the ground look down on it, saying it is too timid, so the impact on the ground will be weakened. Bombing at a high altitude makes it difficult to hit the target, and on the other hand, it is not enough to scare people, so bombing must be carried out in a suitable sky. Besides, intimidation is one of the main tasks of air raids.</p>
<p>Abe: Of course, the effect is like this!</p>
<p>Fujita: Because high altitude is always blowing strong winds from all directions, it is very difficult to hit from high altitude.</p>
<p>The outline of the future air war between Japan and the United States is only favorable for Japan to bomb the United States.</p>
<p>Okada: Hitting the target and influencing people's hearts is the purpose of an air raid.</p>
<p>Abe: Perhaps letting people hear some explosions or letting people see some tragic scenes may have a greater effect.</p>
<p>Oonishi: How difficult it is to overlook the ground when flying to an altitude of more than 13,000 meters. Only when the weather is clear can the boundary between water and land be seen.</p>
<p>Matsuura: It is easy to look down, but difficult to look up. So it is easy for people above to find targets below. When dozens or hundreds of aircraft fly over, they will naturally not look for targets to drop bombs one by one.</p>
<p>Abe: Also, there is a big difference in the technical proficiency of each bomber.</p>
<p>Honne: If a sight cannot be invented, stratosphere aircraft may not be used for bombing in the next year or two, but now high-speed aircraft are being produced in large quantities, and mechanically beautiful aircraft are also being manufactured with each passing day. Whether it is a military aircraft or a transport aircraft, yesterday's aircraft becomes an antique today.</p>
<p>Reporter: Is Japan currently researching stratosphere aircraft?</p>
<p>Honne: Japan is researching whatever foreign countries are researching.</p>
<p>Fujita: Japan may have achieved considerable success, but it just can't be said.</p>
<p>Honne: Everyone thought that the parachute troops had it and they didn't, but as a result, their teachings are quite complete.</p>
<p>Fujita: The question is that we must be ahead and not behind.</p>
<p>Reporter: In this way, maybe it's easy for us to bomb New York!</p>
<p>West: That's impossible. Although the speed of the plane is very fast, it's not that fast. It's still 30 percent slower.</p>
<p>Matsuura: It's definitely not as fast as you say.</p>
<p>Oonishi: It's probably almost there with about 30 percent more speed.</p>
<p>Matsuura: This is obtained by mathematical methods.</p>
<p>Oonishi: If this is the case, it is possible, when going there is a westerly wind, and when coming back is an easterly wind, as long as it is downwind both ways, it is of course possible to bomb. But it is always a westerly wind, and when you come back, it becomes a headwind, and when you go, it is a tailwind.</p>
<p>Fujita: It's very inconvenient when you come back. (Laughter) Then you can go around the earth when you come back.</p>
<p>Reporter: Let's end here! Thank you all for taking time out of your busy schedules to come and give us advice. (Translated by Ji from the February issue of Industrial World)</p>
<h3>Review of the Soviet Winter Counter-Offensive: Failed to Achieve Expected Goals</h3>
<p>(Berlin, 11th, Dōmei News Agency) The Soviet winter counter-offensive, despite reports of Stalin personally going to the front to command, has failed to achieve its expected goals due to an unexpectedly early thaw and a fierce German counter-attack on the southern front. Instead, the Soviet Union finds itself in a position where it must prepare for a German summer offensive. A military reporter from the German News Agency, on the 11th, compared and reviewed the Red Army's initial goals with the results so far, and made the following comments.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the Red Army's goals in this counter-offensive were, first, to recapture Ukraine; second, to force the German army back to the Dnieper River; and third, to recapture the Crimean Peninsula to restore control of the Black Sea. This view can be understood simply by looking at the traces of the Red Army's advance in February, and it is what the Soviet Union itself has declared. One of the most important results of the German army's elastic defense strategy is that the Red Army saw "weaknesses" rather than "strategies" in the German defense line.</p>
<p>On February 5, Soviet military experts wrote an article entitled "The German Army Has No Other Option But to Retreat to the Dnieper River and Await the Red Army's New Offensive," and said that "the only way to stop the German army's retreat is to launch a surprisingly local offensive." However, the "deployment of the situation" is already underway, but it is not worth calling it "surprising." The Red Army's high command, believing that it had penetrated the Donets line, launched several armies in the direction of Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporozhye, and dug its own grave in that area.</p>
<p>The annihilation of these Red Army troops can be said to have opened a new era in the third year of the German-Soviet war. The German army has regained the upper hand on this broad front, repelling the Red Army from most of Ukraine, and preventing the Red Army from reaching the vast resources of the Donets, perhaps permanently. In the past two weeks, the German army's attack units, like a rising tide, have begun to advance eastward; now the center of the battle is the area south of Kharkiv and the area south of Orel, especially in the latter battlefield, where the Red Army is continuing its inevitable counter-offensive in an attempt to reverse its previous setbacks. German authorities have said that "because elite troops have been transferred to the main battlefield, the central front has been allowed to counter-attack by the Red Army": but it is not difficult to understand that the purpose of the Red Army's large-scale offensive on this front is to recapture the Baltic countries.</p>
<p>Communism is a deadly danger to any country in Europe. The people of the Baltic countries are well aware of this, so they have all participated in this European war and are fighting against the Soviet Union. According to the German army authorities, citizens of Latvia and Lithuania are currently organizing volunteer armies, and Estonian volunteers have already taken on one wing of the German army's defense and are participating in the anti-communist war. Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union's attempt to recapture the three Baltic countries is not easy to achieve. (Translated by Ding from the March 14th Yomiuri Hōchi)</p>
<h3>German Army Grabs the Initiative - The Meaning of Taking Kharkov</h3>
<p>(Berlin, 12th Special Dispatch) The German army on the southern front of the Eastern Front broke through the enemy's defense line in Kharkov, rushed into the city one after another, swept through the northern and western areas, and occupied the Red Square in the center of the city. Street fighting is still continuing in the southern area, but its annihilation is only a matter of time. Only three weeks after the city was captured by the Red Army, it will now return to German hands. In this German attack on Kharkov, the main force, under the cover of tank units, advanced in one breath, cutting off the Red Army units deployed on the vast front into several sections, and then annihilating them one by one. Moreover, it overcame countless swamps, small rivers, hills, mountains, forests, and other natural adverse conditions. Such an amazing advance by the German army cannot but be praised. As for the true significance of this battle, it can be described in the following three points.</p>
<p>First, due to the German army's widespread encirclement and simultaneous general advance, the Red Army could no longer carry out any organized resistance except for local resistance. As a result of this general advance, three armies of the Red Army were annihilated, and the attached tank units and mechanized squadrons were also thoroughly defeated, and the results of the battle are still expanding. The losses of the Red Army corps are known to be extremely large.</p>
<p>Second, as a result of the general counter-offensive, in addition to reoccupying a vast area, the German army more importantly captured and annihilated a large number of Red Army troops. According to reports from the front, the Red Army on other fronts is retreating for fear of repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>Third, the impact of this battle on other fronts cannot be ignored. Because the Red Army's large-scale counter-offensive attempt on the entire front was completely lost due to the great defeat in the Kharkov area, and the initiative in the battle was completely seized by the German army.</p>
<p>In this way, the German army's territory in the area surrounded by the Donets, Dnieper, and Mius rivers has been comprehensively strengthened, and a favorable situation has been prepared for the future spring offensive. Even in the central war zone of the Eastern Front, which is under the superiority of the Red Army, the initiative in the war will be completely controlled by the German army, taking the Battle of Kharkov as an opportunity. Even in the Vyazma area, the Red Army does not have enough reserves to catch up with the strategic retreat of the German army, so the retreating German army can consolidate its new defense line at ease with its rear guard. (Translated by Ding from the March 14th Yomiuri Hōchi)</p>
<h3>The Contradictions Between Britain and the US Towards the Soviet Union - Three Countries Contain Three Kinds of Interests</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent from Zöhrlikdorf, 15th) The complex interests of Britain and the United States in relation to the Soviet Union have become apparent since the Casablanca Conference. Recently, due to the "slip of the tongue" issue of US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Standley, it has become even more difficult to resolve. However, the fact that the relationship between these three countries, especially the US and the Soviet Union, is showing a deep-seated opposition, while Britain is taking a mediating stance between the US and the Soviet Union, is noteworthy. It can be said that the purpose of British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to the United States this time is to adjust the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Recently, the US policy towards the Soviet Union was fully stated in the demand made by US Vice President Wallace the other day that "in order for cooperation between the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union to be possible, the Soviet Union should first abandon its world revolution movement." That is, the United States wants to understand the future policies of the Soviet Union before deciding its policy towards the Soviet Union. However, the biggest concern of the United States is what policies the Soviet Union will adopt towards Chongqing and others in the future. On this point, the recent claim by Senator Hillaire has clearly pointed it out, saying: "If Stalin's war aims are not clear, the United States cannot establish a future world plan." It goes without saying that Roosevelt hoped to meet with Stalin around the time of the Casablanca Conference, based on the above-mentioned policy, but Stalin has always turned a deaf ear to Roosevelt's request for a meeting. It is a well-known fact that the United States wants to use the lease of the Siberian base to make the Soviet Union participate in the East Asian war. However, at the same time, the United States is wary of the Soviet Union's actions, which is also worth noting. However, what should be pointed out here is that former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, once made the following public statement on the US policy towards the Soviet Union:</p>
<p>"If the policy of a foreign government does not meet the hopes of the United States, then we must make efforts to make it act according to our wishes. To achieve this goal, there are two methods. Those two methods can be compared to the example of driving a donkey. The first is to use a carrot to lure it to the donkey's nose, and the second is to whip its ass. Such a comparison is easy to understand."</p>
<p>Is the US carrot to the Soviet Union military aid or the strengthening of the debt? Or the unfolding of the Second Front? Let's put it aside for now. However, Standley's slip of the tongue can be regarded as a "slip of the tongue" of a kind of aversion to the Soviet Union's consciousness, and the issue of the Siberian base can be regarded as the United States taking a policy with what Bullitt calls a "whip."</p>
<p>Britain, which is in the middle and has a relatively friendly relationship with both the US and the Soviet Union, is now putting its efforts into mediating between the two. However, there is also the Polish issue standing in the way of the British-Soviet relationship, so it is gradually facing a dead end, which is also worth noting. That is, the Polish government-in-exile, citing the Atlantic Charter, claims to guarantee post-war independence (of course, that refers to the victory of the anti-Axis powers), while the Soviet Union thoroughly insists on annexing Poland without giving way. If Britain is loyal to the Atlantic Charter, then it must realize that it may cause the Soviet Union to leave the anti-Axis camp; if it listens to the Soviet Union's demands, then the Atlantic Charter, the only war aim of Britain and the United States, will be fundamentally negated, and it will fall into a difficult situation of causing the overall defection of small governments-in-exile such as Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Greece. The British political world has been discussing this issue, but recently, Edward Hallett Carr, who is famous for signing the "peace conditions," sent an article to the London Times on the 10th of this month, stating his views on the issue of close cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union as follows:</p>
<p>"It is impossible to guarantee the security of Western Europe without solving the East European question. At this time, what we should especially remember is the failure of the East European delimitation decided at the Versailles Conference. Britain ignored this mistake and insisted on giving Poland guarantees with the Danzig issue as the center in 1939, which resulted in the establishment of the German-Soviet agreement, and finally saw the outbreak of World War II. In principle, we must deny the doctrine of national self-determination. We believe that it is most appropriate for the great powers to establish absolute hegemony, and that small countries should each belong to this double power.</p>
<p>Regarding the above-mentioned views, Carr described them in detail in the so-called "peace conditions" as follows.</p>
<p>"The principle of national self-determination contained in the Atlantic Charter is that small countries cannot be applied after all; because small countries in Central and Eastern Europe are not suitable for the concept of a country. Therefore, the "status quo" in Eastern Europe before the war cannot be used as the basis for determining the post-war state; therefore, these small countries should be included in the Soviet sphere of influence and maintain their existence. Only in this way can these small countries cooperate peacefully with Britain."</p>
<p>Local newspapers believe that the above-mentioned Carr's claim is an informal expression of the British government's views, which seems to be disappointing the small government-in-exile; however, well-informed people in neutral countries believe that as long as the Soviet Union continues to fight the main force of the German army in a decisive battle of the century, Britain has no other way to protect itself except to adopt a "sell-out" policy towards the Eastern European countries. In this way, the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which contains absolutely unsolvable contradictions, is gradually entering an inextricable stage as the contradictions expand and deepen.

<h3>The official cooking oil retailers are temporarily issuing sales based on house tax tickets, and it is estimated that planned sales by weight per capita will be implemented by the end of this month or the beginning of next month. It is possible that the ration of coarse grains will be sold concurrently with the household grain of the 31st term</h3>
<p>According to information from the cooking oil industry association wholesale office, cooking oil will soon be sold once based on house tax tickets in accordance with the old method, and the system of issuing oil by per capita quota based on oil purchase certificates will also be realized in the near future, and preparations are actively underway. It is said that in the past few weeks, it has been quite difficult for residents of this city to purchase even the minimum amount of daily cooking oil needed, so the phenomenon of cooking oil shortage has become widespread among the people. However, it is reported that the cooking oil industry association wholesale office has recently obtained from the authorities an amount of oil sufficient for the needs of the oil sales method based on house tax tickets.</p>
<h3>Rice and Sugar Sales Orders to be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the people's food supply, after the authorities implemented per capita rationing of rice, flour, coarse grains, sugar, and cooking oil, purchase certificates for coarse grains, oil, sugar, etc. have been distributed. A commercial news reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday: (1) The rice and flour for the 30th term have been sold by contracted rice stores based on certificates from the 21st, with a valid period until March 30. The 31st term household grain sales order will be collected on the 25th and sales will begin on April 1; (2) The first term of sugar sales has been carried out by retailers based on certificates since the 11th, until March 31. The second term is allowed to be implemented on April 1, and the ration quantity and price will be announced by the cooperative at that time. As for the issuance of sugar purchase certificates, it will be based on newly registered retailers so that certificate holders can purchase nearby; (3) Cooking oil has been purchased by the military authorities from 12 Chinese and Japanese oil factories in this city and handed over to the cooking oil industry association wholesale office to be distributed to retailers based on certificates. It is heard that it will be implemented from April 1, with the price based on the new oil price set on March 1, and the quantity is estimated to be half a catty per capita; (4) The per capita rationing of coarse grains is heard to be sold concurrently by contracted rice stores when purchasing household grain for the 31st term. The types, quantities, and prices will be announced separately at that time.</p>
<h3>First Term Household Sugar Sales in Blockade Zone Areas</h3>
<p>The first term of per capita sugar sales in the West Shanghai District began yesterday. Residents can purchase the allotted household sugar at designated sugar retailers based on the first term sugar purchase certificates. The scope of this sugar ration has been stipulated by the relevant authorities and is temporarily limited to the Nanshi, West Shanghai, Zhabei, and Pudong city center areas within the blockade zone. The number of sugar rations for residents in the district is temporarily based on the population in March. Regardless of age, half a catty of sugar will be issued per month per capita. The first sugar ration is limited to the end of this month, the 31st, and will be invalid if overdue. The retail price of the rationed sugar is 4 yuan 5 jiao in Central Reserve Certificates per catty for brown sugar (2 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen per half catty), and 4 yuan 7 jiao in Central Reserve Certificates per catty for white sugar (2 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen per half catty).</p>
<h3>Military and Police Rice in Urban Areas to be Rationed This Month</h3>
<p>Regarding the supply and adjustment of rice for military and police in urban areas, the Municipal Food Administration has carefully planned this month and has now completely resolved it. A total of 3,600 bags of rice are required, including 1,788 bags for the security team and 1,802 bags for the police. Once the Food Department has allocated the rice, it will be distributed immediately. As for how the supply will be in April, no solution has been planned yet.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Scholarship Donation Report</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received scholarship donations from all walks of life totaling 1,000 yuan from Mr. Han Gongbei and Ms. Lu Ruosi (transferred from the longevity feast to help Mr. Zhou Feijie), 100 yuan each from Mrs. Wei Zhang, Mrs. Lu Tang, Yang Fuqing, and Qiu Feiran, 150 yuan from Kang Bolan, 60 yuan from Wang Meisheng, 32 yuan 9 jiao from Pu Qiting (in memory of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang), 28 yuan 3 jiao from Moor Associates, 20 yuan each from Ye Hong, Li Fenfu, and Tao Jiayu, 20 yuan from Pu Qiting (in memory of late friends Chuan Hongshui and He Zhongxiao), 10 yuan each from Fei Kedun and Guan Zhuming, 8 yuan from Qu Zhongqing, and 5 yuan each from Hua Yi, Wu Erping, and an anonymous person, totaling 1,794 yuan 2 jiao in Central Reserve Certificates, with a balance of 277,082 yuan 6 jiao 9 fen.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Coconuts and Sugar Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to Dōmei News Agency, a large batch of coconuts and sugar will arrive here from the Philippines today (the 23rd). This is the result of an understanding reached between the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China and the Japanese military authorities in the Philippines. The quantity of these goods is estimated to be several thousand tons. The carrying ship will dock at the old Ning Shao Wharf to unload. The coconuts will be distributed to various soap factories in this city, and the sugar will be prepared for use by the citizens of this city. In the future, the shortage of soap can be greatly relaxed, and sugar will be easier to obtain. Through this barter method, Shanghai will be able to obtain various goods for citizens to consume without any difficulty.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Livestock Control to be Improved</h3>
<p>Due to the implementation of the new system for the movement of materials at the Hongkou Livestock Market, the transportation of various livestock will become more convenient. Therefore, the regulations on controlling livestock in this city are also planned to be changed. According to the market, the number of livestock sold in this city last year was 314,000 pigs, 16,000 cattle, 45,000 sheep, 10,000 pigeons, 909,000 ducks, and 20,220 dan of chickens. Most of the above-mentioned livestock are transported to Shanghai from Xingang, Zhanghuanggang, and Xinshenggang in Jiangbei. The total number is only one-third of what it was before the war. Due to the lack of arrivals, black market prices have been created. It is expected that after the market improves the control measures, livestock prices in this city will tend to fall.</p>
<h3>Reader Forum: A Further Discussion on Youth Employment Issues Luo Chaifu After reading Mr. Ye Minhe's "The Vocational Problems of Young People" in this forum, I feel that this is indeed a serious issue. Seeing that another batch of graduates is about to enter society, in order to prevent graduation from becoming a synonym for unemployment, we should plan ahead and propose several practical methods to help the upcoming group of unemployed. As Mr. Ye said: "Please let social figures take on the responsibility of genuine leadership, which is fortunate for the youth, fortunate for society," and even more fortunate for the nation and humanity.</h3>
<p>For these reasons, I hope that the graduating students themselves will organize to solve their own pressing problems. Every one of us students has an ideal, which is to maintain friendship after starting a career. I remember there was an article in "Free Talk" called "Warm Friendship," which said that friends from middle school are often true friends and can become lifelong confidants, because elementary school students do not understand the value of friendship, and in college or society, the "poison" of money seeps in, making it difficult to find close friends. Everyone also thinks that if they can still work together after graduation, that would be a great help.</p>
<p>With these benefits, our class has organized a permanent alumni association. The vocational problem was also discussed in the association. With the deep discussion of teachers and students, we have obtained some practical methods, so I might as well write them down for reference.</p>
<p>(1) Survey Form—Investigate whether each student will pursue further studies or seek employment after graduation? What kind of job do you want? What is the occupation of your parents?</p>
<p>After filling out the form, it is divided into two parts: one part for further studies and one part for employment. Then, among those seeking employment, students who want the same job are put together. The most important thing is to know the occupation of the parents.</p>
<p>Why? Because after knowing, sincerely ask the parents to cooperate with the school in order to pass on recruitment information. For example, if a parent is very familiar with the banking industry, then if news of a recruitment by a certain bank is revealed, students who have filled in the form wanting a banking career can be notified in advance to prepare for the exam. This is a very adaptable method for current social recruitment, because now when recruiting, the recruitment news is not published on the surface, let alone advertised in newspapers. It all requires internal people to introduce their children to take the exam. Without an introduction, you simply don't know where is recruiting. This is the first benefit. The second benefit is that there is hope of achieving the ideal of "studying together and working together," because if many people take the exam at the same time, it is possible to admit many people at the same time.</p>
<p>(2) Mailing List—After the survey is completed, the school authorities should communicate with the alumni who graduated earlier, because most of the alumni have already found jobs after graduation, so whether their professional circles need to add people, they can naturally know in advance and recommend in advance.</p>
<p>I think these two methods are very willing to be cooperated by the students themselves, the school, and the parents. Especially the parents, who can see that an immediate check that they have invested can be cashed immediately, will be filled with comfort in their hearts regardless of the level of the occupation or the amount of salary. And we ourselves, being able to get a job earlier and familiarize ourselves with the reality of society earlier, are of course also very happy. Economic News Yesterday, the Joint Savings Bank bonds. The transaction was light. Operators sold at 3.73 yuan and bought at 3.68 yuan, a difference of 0.02 yuan. The retail price must be 3.75 yuan, and bought at 3.65 yuan. Japanese military notes tightened. Dealers quoted each other at 5.5556 yuan. Small money shops and banks sold at 5.56 yuan and bought at 5.545 yuan. Comments on the Responsibilities of Trade Associations in the Future Now that the National Federation of Commercial Control has been established, the various trade associations at the grassroots level bear the greatest mission and the greatest responsibility. They should strengthen their forces and take up their responsibilities to complete this arduous task. At the inaugural meeting that day, Mayor Chen said: "The facilities of the National Federation of Commercial Control must be based on the interests of the people's livelihood. If you are capable, you must do it. If you are not capable, you must also do it. If you can only do it if you are capable, and you don't do it if you are not capable, then who will do it?" Minister Mei also said: "Whether the organization of the Commercial Control Federation can implement its mission and promote the work of control in the future depends on the strength of the organization. However, relying solely on the government's strength for control work is not enough. We must concentrate the national economic strength to achieve the goal. At the same time, the control organization itself should appropriately give play to the spirit of autonomy and integrate the strengths of all parties so that the organization can be sound and the work can be successful." These words are all the key points to strengthen trade associations. Not only to strengthen them, but also to require the associations themselves to have a spirit of fearlessness, to work hard without complaint, and to be unswerving; they must also have a spirit of autonomy, be honest and impartial, and be of pure heart.</p>
<p>In the past, the biggest shortcomings of many trade associations were: (1) scattered and without power; (2) facilitating the private plans of a few people; (3) leaders not taking responsibility, listening to one or two secretaries and clerks, engaging in corruption and fraud; (4) those who handle affairs wanting to resign and retire when encountering difficulties, giving up halfway; (5) relying on the government and not thinking of uniting the industry itself to generate power.</p>
<p>These five points are not only true of trade associations, but any industrial and commercial organization cannot avoid this major problem, which must be absolutely avoided.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the various trade associations in the future will correct the past malpractices and implement the following principles under the leadership of the National Federation of Commercial Control:</p>
<p>(1) Concentrate the power of the industry and intensify collective organization. All those in the industry must join the association and must not act freely.</p>
<p>(2) Those who have already assumed duties in the trade association in the future must be absolutely fair and honest, and must not consider personal relationships or act for personal gain; in particular, they must restrain their subordinates, secretaries, clerks, and others from engaging in corruption and fraud; when encountering difficulties, they should work hard without complaint and persevere through the hardships.</p>
<p>(3) The power of the association must come from itself; if there is a spirit of autonomy and united strength, then all parties will cooperate to seek the welfare of the industry, and at the same time, they can also assist the government in promoting economic policies.</p>
<p>We hope that the government will quickly revise the Trade Association Law to rectify the national trade associations and assist the National Federation of Commercial Control in promoting this important wartime economic policy. Qian Dagui, Vice President of the Central Reserve Bank, submitted a request for the Shanghai branch manager's approval. The vacancy will be filled by Supervisor Dai Ailu.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd, Central News Agency—When the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank was being prepared, the environment was treacherous and it was difficult to cope. Therefore, Qian Dagui, the vice president of the bank, also served as the manager to create and develop it. After the opening, thanks to Qian's efforts, the foundation gradually became solid and the business gradually developed. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the remaining forces of the British and Americans and the Chongqing side in the concession were all cleared, and the security of the concession gradually became established. Qian believed that the manager was no longer necessary to be concurrently held by the vice president, and repeatedly asked President Zhou Fohai to resign from the concurrent position. Zhou sincerely retained him until now. Recently, Qian stated again that the bank's situation was getting bigger and the business was getting busier, and he should fully assist the president in seeking the development of the entire bank. He deeply felt that time and energy could no longer be spent on the Shanghai branch, so he again submitted his resignation from the concurrent position. After Zhou carefully considered it, he approved it and internally appointed Dai Ailu, supervisor of the bank and executive director of China Prosperity Bank, to succeed him. It is heard that Dai will go to take office on April 1st upon order.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) The position of Director of the General Affairs Department of the bank has always been concurrently held by Wu Jiyun, Director of the Investigation Department. Wu has now requested to resign from the position of Director of the General Affairs Department because he cannot take care of both. President Zhou has approved it and appointed Ma Jiliang, the Deputy Director of the department, as the Director. Ye Fuxiao is the Chairman of the New Central Savings Association. Li Da and Wu Jiyun are the Party Affairs Committee Members.</p>
<p>Shanghai, Central News Agency—After the Central Savings Association was released from military administration on the 19th of this month, it was approved by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government to have the Central Reserve Bank allocate funds to inherit its assets and liabilities and operate all savings businesses. At the same time, Tang Shoumin and other fifteen people were hired as members of the Supervisory Committee of the Association. The Supervisory Committee of the New Central Savings Association was formally organized and established on the 19th, and held the first Supervisory Committee meeting, which elected Ye Fuxiao as the Chairman of the Supervisory Committee, and Wu Jiyun and Li Da as the Standing Committee Members. It was stipulated that the Supervisory Committee meeting should be held once a month. Its internal organization is still divided into four sections: accounting, general affairs, documents, and business. However, the savings matters of the business section are separately planned and set up as a savings section. It is heard that in terms of business, the scope will be expanded, and plans are being made to issue economic revival lottery tickets, special installment savings, and prize-bearing principal-returning savings bonds, etc., to encourage people's savings interest in many ways. All the original depositors of the old Central Savings Association before the incident can continue their rights and interests after going through legal procedures. Talk by Mr. Tsushima, President of North China Development Company</p>
<p>Beijing, 22nd, Central News Agency—Mr. Tsushima, President of the North China Development Company, went to Nanjing and Shanghai to inspect and had earnest talks with the authorities in Central China. He returned here on the 20th. According to his statement, the central authorities of the National Government are quite aware of the economic situation in North China and are very satisfied with the smooth progress of economic construction in North China. Economic circles in Shanghai have praised the new policy of the Japanese side. The Japanese side took the lead in expressing its willingness to cooperate and abolished the prevention and control of the movement of materials in Central China. At the same time, the National Federation of Commercial Control was established. Therefore, the problem of commodity prices in Central China is expected to be solved satisfactorily. The impact of this organization on the economy of North China is indeed not small. Therefore, it seems that it is planned to set up a branch of the Control Federation in Tianjin. However, the establishment of this branch is by no means for the implementation of the allocation and control of materials in North China. In short, North China and Central China must adopt the principle of mutual communication and make closer connections in the future. The Lower-Level Institutions of the Business Control Federation Mainly Based on Cooperation Between Chinese and Japanese Business Circles</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commercial Control has not been established for long, and its internal institutions have been largely organized and have begun to handle movement permit affairs. The list of members of the Materials Control Committee has also been decided. The adjustment trend of the Japanese business community is also quite active. The lower-level institutions of the Commercial Control Federation are not yet specific and are currently in the preparation period, without active activities. Regarding the composition of the lower-level institutions, except for special materials, they are generally based on cooperation between Chinese and Japanese business circles and are organized independently. The Japanese business community is also proceeding with adjustments based on the above methods. The following preparatory work is noteworthy:</p>
<p>(1) There is a tendency for the Japanese business community to establish combinations indiscriminately. According to the principle of one industry, one combination, it is necessary to reorganize and merge them. Organizations with two or more combinations in one industry will be gradually merged and abolished to strengthen efficiency.</p>
<p>(2) Combinations without distribution or purchase boundaries must be strictly distinguished and formed into units to join the new control organization.</p>
<p>(3) It is hoped that an agency will be established to negotiate with the Commercial Control Federation as a spokesperson for the wholesale business community and the public. (March 21st, Continental News) Chinese Stockbrokers Yesterday Requested Registration with the Economic Bureau. More than 130 Chinese stock brokerage firms in the city have been suspended from business for more than a month since they followed the authorities' orders. It is now heard that the majority of the industry has followed the authorities' instructions and first applied to the Engineering Bureau for a license to operate. Yesterday, Zhou Lundi, Zhang Yilin, Sun Wencheng, Han Jixiang, and others gathered the industry and applied to the Special City Economic Bureau for supplementary registration, hoping that the resumption of business in the industry would be resolved as soon as possible. The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Urges Members to Register Simple Factories. The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association of this city previously received a letter from the Jiangsu Tax Bureau, stating in brief: "This bureau has organized and established that the factory registration matters of all simple weaving factories should be filled out by the factory numbers according to the format, and the attachments should be submitted to the bureau for registration." After receiving the letter, the association issued a notice to its members to comply. There are indeed many members who have complied, but there are also many who are waiting to see. Therefore, the association has recently received repeated notices from the bureau, asking them to forward the notice to urge members to process the registration as soon as possible. It is understood that the registration of simple weaving factories is a necessary procedure for the movement and sale of yarn and cloth in the dyeing and weaving industry. The association has issued separate notices, urging all members who have not yet applied for registration to go to the association to collect the registration form (5 yuan per copy), fill it out, and submit it for approval. If there are any unclear procedures, etc., they can also go to the association to inquire. Financial Stabilization Bonds to Pay Interest on Schedule The government previously issued 150 million yuan of financial stabilization bonds to stabilize finances and manage old legal tender. They were issued on June 1st of last year. According to the regulations, interest is paid twice a year, every six months from the date of issuance. Interest is paid only within ten years, and principal is repaid from the eleventh year. It is heard that the second phase of interest payment is 37.5 million yuan, which has been allocated by the Ministry of Finance from the special accounting income according to the principal and interest repayment schedule and deposited in the Central Reserve Bank's bond fund account for repayment. It is heard that full interest will be paid by the Central Reserve Bank starting from May 31st. The ministry will issue a public notice at that time so that everyone knows. Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Trade Conditions in Recent Months Shanghai, Central News Agency—According to financial sources, Shanghai's industrial and commercial trade conditions have obviously become more active in recent months. Although the Nanyang aspect has not been fully restored, there has been a concrete approach with the Philippines since the establishment of the Philippine port material agreement. It is estimated that what Shanghai ships to the Philippines is silk, medicinal materials, cotton textiles, etc., while what the Philippines ships to Shanghai is sugar, tobacco, and Manila hemp, etc. At the same time, an agreement has been reached with Singapore on the exchange of materials. It has been agreed that Shanghai will export soap, matches, cotton cloth, silk, etc., and import raw materials such as oil and rubber. In addition, the Shanghai-Hong Kong material trade agreement has not been concluded. The materials traded by both parties are Shanghai's cotton textiles, grains, groceries, and Hong Kong's stored sugar.</p>
<p>Domestic Aspects Trade between Central China and North China agreed in January of this year to amend a part of the trade agreement concluded here in early April and conclude a new agreement.</p>
<p>Key points of the agreement</p>
<p>(1) Promote the exchange of materials between the two parties and maintain the balance of payments in both regions; (2) Stipulate the special yuan as the currency for exchange settlement, but military tickets and Shanghai exchange can also be used in conjunction; (3) Divide the trade agreement into two types: specific material trade and general material trade. The so-called specific materials are coal, pyrite ore, pig iron, alkali powder, etc., transported from the north to the south, and wheat flour, sugar, ammonium sulfate, tobacco, gauze, rayon, tea, and paper rush, etc., transported from the south to the north. The so-called general materials are glass, peanut oil, and other agricultural products, etc., transported from the north to the south, and paper, Chinese medicine, metal products, stationery, soap, leather, groceries, etc., transported from the south to the north. Cigarette Allocation Prices Announced by China Central Tobacco Company Black Market Swept Away. After the China Central Tobacco Company's intensive efforts, the allocation of cigarettes in this city has been largely completed. Major tobacco dealers in this city have been contacting the company for wholesale matters in recent days. According to the company authorities, the quantity and price of allocated cigarettes have been agreed upon and will be announced in the coming days. Major tobacco dealers are divided into two levels, A and B. Roughly, level A is allocated more goods and has more small tobacco dealers under it, while level B is less. From the date of sale of allocated cigarettes, the black market price of cigarettes in this city will be swept away. All cigarettes sold by each tobacco dealer must be sold to customers at the official price. News in Brief The Central Market Nanshi Land Cargo Investment Consortium has been prepared. A founding meeting was held at the Central Market Nanshi Market yesterday (22nd) at 3 pm, and 23 directors and supervisors were elected. The second issue of the "China Industry" monthly magazine compiled and published by the China Industrial Bank has been published. The content includes Pan Yao's "Cooperation between the Industrial and Financial Sectors," Cai Shoubai's "Assistance to Industry and the China Industrial Bank," Pan Yinge's "Shanghai Finance in 1942," and other articles. It is sold by the magazine's distribution department at 1010 Dahua Road intersection, Jing'an Temple Road. The annual subscription is 30 yuan, half a year is 16 yuan, and the retail price is 3 yuan per copy. The Dynamics of Daily Necessities Sugar Sugar has been rationed by population since the 11th. The control and allocation of sugar was implemented after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Regarding sales in the inland, an inland sales agreement council was established in the past to control the exporting side, but it was completely free in Shanghai. The pre-war sugar market was an important commodity market because idle funds were used here. Especially in the three months before the outbreak of the war, the market was chaotic, and even laymen intervened. With the tension in the Japanese-American negotiations, various rumors of war rose, and market prices rose step by step, breaking through 300 yuan. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, Japanese troops entered the concession, and various important materials were restricted, including sugar. All were registered with the military distribution association. From this time on, about 000,000 dan were registered by the Chinese merchants. The annual sugar demand in Central China is about 000,000 dan. In advance, the Chinese merchants expected Japan and the United States to go to war, so they imported enough sugar, exceeding one year's demand. The military distribution association took over the inventory in the concession, including the association's spot goods, and established a rationing and control plan, which was the beginning of controlled sugar in Shanghai. Therefore, a Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative was newly established as the allocation agency for the Chinese merchants. All the powerful merchants on the Chinese side joined. The Japanese allocation agency was not set up separately, but was entrusted to the Food Commercial Association to control and allocate. The price of white sugar was set at 7 jiao and 1 fen per jin of Japanese gold. The allocation quantity was not stipulated by either the Chinese or Japanese side, but was increased or decreased at any time according to the needs of the season, and a flexible control and allocation was implemented. A year has passed since the start of control, and there has been no change in the control, but the price has fluctuated a bit. It fell to 6 jiao and 8 fen per jin of Japanese gold in June of last year, and then rebounded to 7 jiao and 8 fen in September of the same year. Around November of last year, rumors spread that the inventory was exhausted and a coupon-based distribution system would be implemented. In Hongkou, you could also see long queues of people buying sugar in front of the stores. Later, it was announced that the stock was abundant, and the panic buying was lifted. In the end, there was no special black market, which was much better than matches, cigarettes, soap, etc. The reason why sugar control was relatively smooth was first because its inventory was more abundant than other commodities, and second, because the Chinese merchants were able to cooperate actively without the slightest unwillingness. According to the authorities of the military distribution association, the population-based rationing system implemented from the 11th of this month can limit consumption. This is a necessary measure for wartime life and is not due to a reduction in inventory. This year's sugar, about a considerable amount can come from Zha Port and Taiwan. In the future, trade with the South can also be restored, and there is no need to worry about a shortage of sugar supply. (March 19th, Continental News)</p>

<p>Free Talk Understanding "Human Defects" Xu Yuzhang Living in a turbulent era, in a high-pressure area of life, I am afraid that everyone, whether poor or rich, is lurking in a shadow of "defects." We only need to look at this society, which is bustling and bustling all day long, scheming and fighting for themselves to find ways to "bring in" and use funds to "make up for" the performances, which is clear evidence.</p>
<p>In fact, the root of this "defect" did not originate today. Since the birth of mankind, the embryo of "defect" has been nurtured. Only because there are "defects" can mankind continue to evolve. As Darwin's "Theory of Human Evolution" says, "defects" are the path to progress. If people in the Stone Age felt that everything given by the universe was "satisfied" and without "defects," then we might regress to the primitive era and become modern barbarians. Where would there be great nations and brilliant cultures? Therefore, using reasonable methods to complete the "future" from "defects" to satisfaction is urgently needed by mankind. However, many people have distorted its definition and embarked on the path of "selfishness," using "trickery" and "exploitation" to satisfy their "defects," and even using any means to satisfy their "defects" for a while.</p>
<p>Mankind has a pair of gifted, flexible "hands" and possesses a "brain" that is "superior to all things," and can "advance with both hands and brain" to pioneer in the realm of "unlimited extraction and inexhaustible use" of nature, and excavate what you need—whether spiritual or material, to satisfy your "defects." Why use heinous "trickery and plunder"!</p>
<p>It is said that in the course of his life, man has always lived a contradictory life, forever occupying the shadow of "defects"; for example, having "enough" still wants "warmth," having both "enough" and "warmth" still wants "lust"... Although after natural evolution, the ambition remains unchanged. Therefore, the "defects" of "life" cannot be "satisfied."</p>
<p>However, this argument is also biased. If human beings fully understand the truth in the "defects of life," possess the forward-looking thought of "progress," and use the method of "frugality and love of people" said by Confucius to obtain reasonable "satisfaction," this world would not be as miserable as it is now. Talk about "Education of Love" Ji Chen In this cosmopolitan city, everything is blinded by "money." What people see are money and goods that are more valuable than money, and what they hear is everything about "money." Talking about education is very disappointing. Unless it is a poor educator or a general higher-level intellectual, no one will appreciate your words.</p>
<p>Education, in the eyes of a group of vulgar people, is like goods that can be bought with money. As long as you pay the fees and send your children to school, isn't that the end of it? But no. Education needs to start at home. This article is about the education of "love" in the family.</p>
<p>Although theoretical education is not easy to implement for the time being, practical education related to the future of children cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Therefore, Dr. Boshe said: "When your children are young, you should train them to become upright, resourceful, and agile."</p>
<p>To train children, we must first be patient and slowly guide them into the right path. If you have tried repeatedly without success and feel discouraged, then you have failed.</p>
<p>In the family, we must pay special attention to the following points: (1) the quality of the books that children read daily; (2) do not be indifferent to children; (3) inspire children's interests; (4) pay attention to the friends they make at ordinary times; (5) encourage them to participate in collective life; (6) never set a bad example; (7) pay attention to their speech and behavior.</p>
<p>The first time we discover each mistake, we should correct it immediately. Because every bad word and deed is cultivated from childhood. We must never use the excuse that children are young to cause great obstacles to family education. And we must not arbitrarily indulge out of doting.</p>
<p>Usually, we are not easy to be aware of doting, but only feel that it is a reasonable and proper love. Unexpectedly, it has harmed our children invisibly. This is a matter that is extremely related to the future of the country and must be corrected by all means.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I saw a lively and lovely child's photo in the window of a photo studio with four words: "Don't Kiss Me." This sentence is not without basis. Because most of children's diseases are transmitted from this seemingly loving behavior, and all mothers are prone to this unintentional mistake. Perhaps the child will lose his little life because of this. This is such a dangerous thing.</p>
<p>Regarding the various mistakes caused by "love," due to the limitation of space, I will not discuss them one by one. Anyway, the books on this aspect are very rich in various libraries. For the sake of the future of the country and the future of our children, we may take the time out of our busy schedule to borrow a few books home to read and correct our past mistakes. Root Xin Bo "Here, Old Gen, take it. The foreign money is all good. If you don't believe it, you might as well knock it piece by piece."</p>
<p>"How can the foreign money from Lord Huang's mansion be bad?" Genming said, still wrapping the original old newspaper, twitching his face, shaking his hands, and stuffing it into his shirt pocket.</p>
<p>"A Wu, A Wu," Huang Chong'an called, "Get the wine warm and bring out the supper."</p>
<p>In A Wu's response, Genming said goodbye to Huang Chong'an: "Thank you, Lord Huang, so that our family can have a peaceful New Year." There was some coldness in his voice, and he turned to Yang Zijie and Yu Duzhou and said, "I'll treat you two to a drink on the street tomorrow." There was some warmth in these words.</p>
<p>"What about me?" Lu Baishu stretched out his hand to stop Genming. He had completely sobered up when he heard about warming the wine.</p>
<p>"You, wait for me at Wu Laosi's shop tomorrow."</p>
<p>As soon as Genming arrived in the hall, A Wu ran out from a room on the east side and said, "Old Gen, are you going back?" "Let me light a lantern to send you out. It's very dark in the house, and you are unfamiliar with it. It's not easy to walk without light."</p>
<p>In Genming's polite thanks, A Wu lit the lantern, and then the two walked into the courtyard and entered the house on the west side; then they went north from there, going out one courtyard after another. There were five courtyards in total, all empty and uninhabited.</p>
<p>"I'm very sad to hear you say that," A Wu said, holding the lantern in front, "Rich people are all unscrupulous!..."</p>
<p>"Alas, who told you to have no money!" Genming sighed behind him. Second Place in the February Essay Contest How to Read Books, What Books to Read? (Part 2) Ying Yuanze How to Seek Breadth It is undoubtedly appropriate to use the "browsing method" to seek breadth; however, the "browsing method" cannot be achieved overnight, and must be cultivated at any time in childhood, so that it can be cultivated into a habit. Once the habit is formed, it can be browsed through no matter what book. The key to this reading method is to concentrate the reader's attention, use keen vision and comprehension, quickly read several chapters of a book, or select the important parts to read, and omit the unimportant ones. The most important thing is to be able to understand the train of thought of the book or the general idea of its content, so as to avoid the drawbacks of random reading. In addition, readers must make full use of fragmented time, and must pre-determine the decision order for the books to be read, so as to avoid disorder or wasting time. From a broad point of view, the main reading methods are nothing more than "seeking precision" and "seeking breadth." In addition, many trivial reading methods belong to either "seeking precision" or "seeking breadth." Due to space limitations, it is impossible to enumerate them one by one. (2) What Books to Read? Now that we know how to read books, the next question is "What books to read?" This question is closely related to the first question, because if we don't know what books to read, why talk about reading methods first? Book Selection Criteria The world is like a sea of smoke, and the time that can be used for reading in life is so short. In this way, to finish reading many beneficial books in a limited time, the only way is to know how to select books; but selecting paintings is not an easy task. Selecting books and wanting to "do everything well": - having a hundred benefits and no harm - it is best to stipulate several book selection criteria in advance as practical guidance when selecting books. Now, according to what I have seen, I will briefly describe the three most important points for readers' reference: (1) It must be able to enhance our basic knowledge - books of this kind include society, economy, politics, science, philosophy, history, geography, and common sense, etc., and newspapers and magazines also belong to this category. (2) It must be beneficial to personal cultivation - books of this kind include celebrity biographies and essays, poetry and novels, ethics and morality, as well as self-cultivation and personality cultivation. (3) It must make a direct contribution to making a living - such as occupations, technology, industry, pharmacy, law, physics and chemistry, or languages, etc., all belong to this category. They have a direct or indirect relationship to the occupation that individuals are engaged in. They are not theoretical books, but tool books. The author has put forward several criteria for selecting books, but if there is no suggestion for practical books, that is not reasonable. As for the tool books contained in the third item, the scope is too broad, so I have to omit them. Patients with Cough and Sputum Attention to Social Services Yang Yusheng Recently, the weather has been cold and hot, and many people have coughs. Coughs can be divided into: (1) Dry cough, such as inflammation of the throat, bronchitis, pleurisy, early tuberculosis, heart disease, gastritis, women's pregnancy, etc., all have coughs, but coughs without sputum do not need to take expectorants. (2) Wet cough, such as bronchial leakage, lung abscess, lung gangrene, the sputum must be examined to diagnose what kind of disease, and then medicine can be selected. (3) Barking cough, the cough sounds like a dog barking, with a long sound, such as children suffering from diphtheria (infectious disease), whooping cough (commonly known as egret cough) because its cough sound is special, it cannot be treated according to ordinary methods. (4) Paroxysmal cough, with bursts of cough, such as children suffering from angina (i.e., tonsil swelling), influenza, throat disease, bronchial disease, and nervous diseases, also need to be distinguished. (5) Resonant cough, the cough sounds like the sound of knocking on a jar or pot, its sound is empty, the cough sound resonates with the air in the chest, or there is pneumothorax. (6) Small cough, a very slight cough, should not be taken lightly, or it is chronic rhinitis of the upper respiratory tract, or early pulmonary tuberculosis. (7) Silent cough, coughing without sound, such as nervous "hysteria" or vocal cord paralysis. In addition, such as swelling of the lymph glands in the trachea of children, or stimulation caused by the accumulation of earwax, or reaction caused by parasites in the intestines, a doctor should be asked to identify them. There are also various kinds of sputum coughed out, including mucous sputum, rusty sputum, foul-smelling sputum, foamy sputum, and bloody sputum. The time of coughing is different, there is coughing in the morning when waking up, and coughing before going to bed. As for cough medicines, do not buy them indiscriminately, because there are various kinds of medicines, including suppressants, stimulants, and solvents, depending on the condition. Regarding the condition's doubts, my colleagues at the Friends' Aid Medical Society on Shanghai Notre Dame Road can answer them free of charge.

<h3>Yuanshun Rice Store: Deducting from Ration Allotment</h3>
<p>Cai Ruen and Ye Shineng, employees of the Hengda South Goods Store at No. 265 Qipu Road, went to Yuanshun Rice Store at No. 729 Penglu Road at 11:00 AM on the 21st of this month to collect white rice with nine ration tickets, totaling two dou and two and a half sheng. However, Cai and others had long known that Yuanshun Rice Store's scales were inaccurate and that they deducted rice rations. Therefore, they brought their own scales. Unexpectedly, upon weighing the rice, they discovered that it was short by two and a half pounds. They immediately reported this to the French Concession Police, who dispatched Detective Gao Yongan and Japanese Detective Meguro to investigate. The investigation confirmed the facts, and the police brought Chen Zhongwei, the owner of Yuanshun Store, along with his employees Ni Yongsheng, Lu Laisheng, and Zai Yuexiang, as well as the measuring dipper, to the police station. They were ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police lawyer filed charges according to law. After Judge Yang questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be detained for further verification.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Saving Electricity</h3>
<p>Thrift is originally a virtue. In any era and any situation, one should practice thrift. Especially in wartime, because of the sharp increase in the consumption of materials, thrift is no longer a passive virtue but an active and absolute necessity.</p>
<p>Electricity, the power for all industrial production, is an extremely urgent need. In order to increase production, it is necessary to concentrate electricity on the industrial sector, or at least reduce all non-productive electricity consumption to the lowest possible limit and transfer it to all production uses. This is a simple theory.</p>
<p>However, let us look back at the current electricity situation in Shanghai. On the one hand, non-productive consumption, although repeatedly restricted, is still brilliant in entertainment venues, catering establishments, storefront model rooms, etc. Has it been reduced to the minimum level of consumption? On the other hand, old factories and workshops can only work for three or five days a week due to electricity restrictions, and factories and workshops that are preparing to be built cannot start work because they cannot obtain electricity. Generally speaking, the industry of a country at war should produce day and night to meet the needs. Then, how can our industry be said to be in line with the principle of increasing production?</p>
<p>We hope that the relevant authorities will pay attention to this unreasonable phenomenon, restrict non-productive electricity consumption on the passive side, and quickly find ways to increase coal production and increase electricity supply to fully supply productive factories and workshops on the active side, because "increasing production" is already the most important point in the wartime economic policy outline, and it is also the main material factor in winning the Greater East Asia War!</p>
<h3>Toho Theatre Troupe: Scheduled Performance in Beijing; Chen Yunshang and Others to Accompany</h3>
<p>The Japanese art envoy Toho Kabuki Troupe has been in Shanghai for many days and has been busy responding to various invitations. It is now heard that the entire troupe, led by troupe leader Shibusawa Hideo, will go to Beijing on the 25th of this month to participate in the celebration of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. They will also begin performing at the Dahua Grand Theater for seven days starting on the 29th. Tickets for the Dahua are already on pre-sale starting yesterday, the 21st, with three prices: 15 yuan, 25 yuan, and 35 yuan. Those who went to pre-purchase were very enthusiastic, and it is expected that there will be a grand occasion when the performance begins.</p>
<p>The 30th of this month is the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. The stars of the China United Film Company also plan to make a special trip to Beijing to participate in the celebration. Chen Yunshang and Zhou Manhua are scheduled to leave together on the 29th of this month. Li Lihua, Wang Danfeng, Bai Guang, and Xi Qiuxia are scheduled to go to Beijing with the Toho Kabuki Troupe on the 25th. It is expected that when the celebration of the return to the capital is held, the capital will be filled with starlight, creating a particularly lively scene.</p>
<h3>Civil Cases: Deadline for Settlement</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that civil cases handled by courts in various places are often delayed and not resolved, causing the litigants to suffer from litigation fatigue, which is not appropriate. Therefore, in order to rectify this situation effectively, it specially ordered the Shanghai courts that all unresolved civil cases that have been delayed for more than half a year, except for those with special circumstances, must be cleared and completed within three months and must not be delayed any further, so as to avoid inconvenience.</p>
<h3>Additional Yangtze River Ferry</h3>
<p>Recently, the entry and exit of materials in North China have been frequent, especially those to and from Central and South China. Transportation mainly relies on trains. Last year, there was a new ferry, Jinling Maru, between Nanjing and Pukou, with six tracks laid on the upper deck, a deadweight of 2,300 tons, and operating connections. Currently, freight cars are very crowded and it is already felt that it is insufficient. Therefore, the Central China Railway Company has decided to add another ferry to facilitate freight transport. It is heard that the ship will still be built by the Shanghai Mitsubishi Shipyard (i.e., Jiangnan Shipyard), of the same type and class, and will start construction in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Tourist Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>At about 5:15 PM yesterday, a tourist in his thirties, wearing a blue cloth long gown, secretly swallowed poisonous liquid medicine and committed suicide at the Tianyun Building cinema on the rooftop garden of Wing On Company. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died shortly after.</p>
