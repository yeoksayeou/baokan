<h3 id="c1">「助學運動」的新意義 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>復興中國最重要的條件是什麼？我們拿這個問題去請敎當代專家學者以至實際的從政者。其答案雖不能一致，但是，我們可以斷言，決沒有一個人不提到這一個條件：「人才」！「人才」！「要有足夠的人才」！</p>
<p>我們所希望的中國復興，或新中國的建設，固然需要政治的修明，也就是需要有一個最完善的政治機構和政治綱領，然而，更重要的，是需要推動政治機構和實施政治綱領的人。所以，先賢曾說：「有治法，不可無治人。」近代中國之所以國勢衰弱，固由於政治未見澈底修明，而最根本的原因，是在於缺乏眞正的人才。我們試觀二三十年來的歷史，相當完善的政治機構或政治制度，不能說絕對沒有，相當完善的政綱政策，更不能說絕對缺乏。但是，可以嚴格稱爲「眞正人才」者，尤其居於上層領導地位者，實在太寥落可數了！結果，一切良好的政治機構，制度，綱領與政策，都無從推行盡行，於是，國家便日益陷於衰弱了。追念過去，既已有不勝人才寥落之感，環顧目前，又覺培養人才之工作，未見盡力，而瞻念國運前途，更不能不爲有志者所寢食不安！</p>
<p>我們認這無論在戰時，或準備戰後建設，政府方面有許多必需舉辦的事業，因這沒有適當的人才而不能立即舉辦，也有許多已辦的事業，因爲缺乏充分與適當的人才，而陷於停滯或不能收獲預期的效果。不僅是政府，就是金融界，經濟界，企業界，文化界，這種現象同樣明顯。所以各種事業，終於擱置，不能實現，其原因常是人才不足與人才難得。</p>
<p>今日人才不足的嚴重現象，可以說，，是過去十年二十年間敎育落後，尤其是敎育不普及的結果。我們要問十年二十年後中國的建設如何？國運如何？那就不能不看看今日的人才培養情形如何？今日的敎育普及到什麼程度？後之視今，亦猶今之視昔，那麼，瞻念前途，能不令人爲國運而焦急呢？因此，如何普及敎育，加緊培育人才，實是今日最緊急的任務。否則人才缺乏，什麼完善的政治機構，綱領，政策以至事業計劃，都無從實現。普及敎育的責任，固然在政府有關當局，但是，從目前我國的實際情形而言，由於國家戰時財政的膨大，我們勢不能以敎育及培養人才的全責，完全期待於政府，我們必須喚起民間的有遠見人士，有實力人士，大家振奮起來，協力政府，改善及充實敎育機構，擴大培育人才運動，因此，我們歷年舉辦的「助學金」運動，其意義竊敢附驥於此。</p>
<p>本報創辦助學金的重要意義，實際上已經獲得社會各界人士的深刻認識，我們眼看社會熱心人士，有的捐薪助學，有的變產助學，有的聯合親友集體助學，還有許多在校學生也踴躍參加助學運動。這種熱烈互助的精神，深深地銘刻在我們的心目中，也銘刻在未來新中國建設的光榮歷史上。</p>
<p>我們從參加助學義舉的人數及捐助數額之逐年增加，可以證明社會人士對於助學義舉認識之增强。又從接受助學學生之增加，更可使我們興奮，因這我們的精力沒有白費，而且更可因此期勉其他文化團體同樣努力於助學運動，我們深信，只要大家努力推行，對於國家社會的前途，一定有不可估計的助益。</p>
<p>現在本學期已告結束，下學期的助學事務即將開始，從實際情形說，由於物價的高漲，學校增加收費，或將不免，在下學期，無力繼續就學的人數，不知又將增加多少！準備入學者之望而却步者又不知有多少！我們不忍眼大量的靑少年們，因爲求學的費用不足，而徘徊於學校門外乃至流浪於街頭。爲着國家社會的前途，爲着民族要立足於未來世界，我們社會上每一個人都有責任，盡自己的力，去幫助兒童們少年們靑年們能夠入校求學。以上海一地而論，每個比較富裕的人，能特別節约出十餘元，則數百萬元不難集成於短時期之內，就可使數千靑少年們無愁失學了！因此。我們更積極地舉辦助學金運動，更熱望社會各界一致奮起。踴躍捐助。</p>

<h3 id="c2">重光外相闡明　日本外交政策要旨　平等互惠樹立中善鄰關係　謀各民族解放以建設大東亞 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日重光外相十七日在衆院預算總會，答議員太田正孝所提「帝國大東亞政策所予國際間之影響及其活用方法如何」之質問，乃就任以來初次闡明日本外交政策要旨如次：東條總理於昨日演說時，已闡明帝國之不動大方針，乃在使大東亞永久解脫英美等國之多年桎桔，恢復共本來姿態。今日東亞十億民衆已確信無大東亞戰爭之勝利，即無大東亞之解放；無大東亞之建設，即無大東亞民衆之福祉。吾人對此大東亞民衆之要望，給予精神與協力，此其時矣。故關於使大東亞恢復其本來姿態一事，前曾屢述其具體方案，此即對於各國或予以完全獨立，或許其廣汎的參與政治，以達成其希冀，在相互平等互惠關係上，樹立善鄰之協力關係。根據此種見地，以建設東亞，對於擾亂東亞之安定與和平者予以防禦，所謂使大東亞地域之民族國家實現其多年期待，以平等互惠立塲相互協力者，前已於對華新政策中逐漸見諸實現，此即爲重新開拓中日新關係樹立中日兩國之善鄰關係也。帝國政策乃在澈底實施此方針，使其精神普及於大東亞各地，以謀十億民衆之團結，此亦即大東亞之眞正建設，此種政策乃帝國肇國以來之精神，且爲極古之精神，惟雖如此之古，同時亦係一極新之問題。</p>
<p>綜述國際關係揭破英美野心</p>
<p>關係何所謂新，此處願就國祭關係以陳述之，諸君當知英美荷等國之東洋政策，乃分割統治政策，以言英國，則英國之對印政策乃在離間彼等以治之，對於歐洲大陸則爲勢力均衡之政策，其於東亞則爲離間中日而使之相互爭，蓋其雅不欲東亞有一强大之國家存在也。彼等此種政策，常以擾亂爲目的，而藉以滿足其政治野心，故根本上即爲破壞政策，排除此種破壞政策及其分子而建設大東亞之宏願，並即帝國之大方十。又彼等於經濟方面所採之政策爲何，尤其彼等之殖民地政策爲何，佔領殖民地後將其封鎖而　佔其利益者，乃彼等之政策，其與帝國所倡之解放資源互惠平等等方針根本不同。彼等之對華政策如何，彼等之對印政策如何，彼等之對亞洲政策又如何，此於經濟方面乃極明瞭之事實，不將此等政治上經濟上之魔手予以剷除，即不能開拓建設之途。過去帝國爲實現肇國以來之大精神，曾最大努力，然常遭遇種種困難，共過去不易充分發揚此精神之原因何在，自有種種原因，不易簡單說明。</p>
<p>武力驅除魔手開拓建設途徑</p>
<p>然自大局以觀，英美等勢力侵入東亞，本具有破壞性質，發揮其攪亂作用，英美之魔手因此次帝國之非常努力與鬥爭漸被劇除，亦即以我陸海空軍之直接力量剷除者，於茲乃打開建設之途，此大東亞之建設乃肇國以來忠誠精神之表現，保護此種精神者即帝國之武力。今後此魔手若繼續存在，則我等即須始終從事防衛大東亞，此防衛乃由大東亞全域各國家民族自動協力而實行者，實則如前所述亞洲之解放，即我國策，若不解放大東亞使脫離英美等之榨取，則亞洲即不能安定，更不足以談建設大東亞。如今亞洲已非英美之殖民地，英美政策常遇暗礁，全係因榨取獨占終至演成經濟戰爭所致。彼等雖主張戰爭非政策之工具，但公然宣言經濟戰爭圖使他國屈服，如資金凍結即其一例，凍結至最後，自不能不發生戰爭也是。即此次大東亞戰爭之原因，已無贅述必要，英美自非東亞各國各民族之友邦，乃我等之仇敵，觀西方之近况，可知於現實保護各小國者乃德義軸心國，英美標榜大國主義而不欲小國利益如斯，綜括國際關係觀之，我國對大東亞之大方針，爲解放亞洲建設大東亞，此乃建設政策自與英美之擾亂政策及破壞政策不同，此對於各民族各國家尤其大東亞各民族，均有重大意義。合乎此正義之政策，必得全世界諒解，敵方或亦諒解此政策而屈服於此種意義下，我等須推行此政策以完成戰爭。余認帝國從事此戰爭，將來以一大國資格存在之前途亦在於能推行基於正義之政策，相信可令亞洲黎明，完成大東亞建設，此即將來世界永久之幸福，和平之大基礎也云。</p>
<p>汪兼院長發表談話感謝友邦深厚友誼</p>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　東條首相十六日在日議會發表演說後，我國官民均感興奮，對大東亞戰爭之完遂，東亞民族之共存共榮，益增其確信，而對於東條首相之「根本改訂中日旣存條約」厚意，尤爲歡迎注視。汪兼行政院良對此特發表談話，於十七日下午三時由林宣傳部長對首都中外記者發表全文如後：「友邦日本帝國議會開會之際，東條首相所發表之施政演說，實爲大東亞共榮主義之具體的開示，大東亞戰爭之目的，於此更爲明瞭。余確信全東亞各國家民族聞此演說，對於自國前途，對於東亞全局，必更堅決其信仰，而東亞民族之團結必更固如磐石也。本大東亞戰爭顧名思義，實爲東亞民族自求解放，並無侵略他洲之意。惟百年以來，英美懷侵略世界之野心，尤以東亞爲其殖民地，故促成此次戰爭，凡東亞各國家民族，皆當以東亞同志之資格，立於同一戰綫，絕不容許有東亞叛逆一人之存在。友邦日本目發動大東亞戰爭以來，將英美勢力在東南太平洋一帶根本掃蕩，實已立必勝不敗之基礎，最近聯合艦隊司令長官山本元帥之戰死，阿圖島守軍之全体殉職，更昭示東亞民族以致命遂志之模範，不特友邦日本全體軍民情　爲之緊張，凡東亞民族皆同此感。茲者東條首相更於帝國　會披　決意，扶助東亞各國家民族，俾得永脫英美之覊絆，完成各愛其國互愛其鄰共愛東亞之夙願，東亞各國家民族聞此德音，感激踴躍，益勵其共同邁進之精神有必然者。而對於中國友誼之厚，期望之殷，援助之益力，允使中國政府以及全體人民感奮無已，本年一月九日友邦日本爲援助中國完成獨立起見，首先交還租界撤消治外法權以來，已使中國人士感覺前途之光明，增加無限之勇氣。今更進一步對中日兩國所訂之條約，從根本上予以改訂，此允於中日兩國之親善關係，有莫大之增益。國民政府還都以來，與友邦日本所訂條約，其主要原則在使中日兩國協力，以共同致力於以道義爲基礎之東亞新秩序之建設，此項原則固永久不磨。惟其間因顧慮當時環境，被英美勢力之乘間侵入肆其擾害，不得不有權宜之措置，今英美勢力已經掃蕩，環境巳經改變，從而爲斷然之改訂，使中國在軍事上經濟上，更能發揮總力，完成統一，且更能以其國力貢獻於大東亞戰爭。吾人於感謝友邦日本深厚的友誼之餘，惟有更加奮發戮力邁進，以期中日共勞之實現，大東亞戰爭目的之早日完遂。</p>
<p>三軸心國緊聯擊最後勝利信念益堅</p>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　德國各界對於日東條首相此次於議會中所發表之施政演說，均極爲重視。德施密特博士十六日午於外交部定例接見記者團席上，於說明日東條首相演說之要點時，對於東條首相所述確信歐洲盟邦諸國所遂行之雄渾戰爭，必可獲得成功。及表明日本與盟邦緊密連繫支援之下，共同作戰到底，以擊減英美之決意各點，允特別重視。德各報除於十六日晚刊上大事揭載東條首相之演詞外，並紛紛加以評論。如柏林晚報稱，「三國同盟必可獲得勝利無疑」。柏林交易報稱，義國法西斯黨書記長前會闡明義國民衆決奮戰至獲得最後勝利而後止，今日東條首相復聲明與歐洲盟邦諸國緊密連繫之下作戰，至確保共同勝利而後止之決意。至德民衆於世界戰局之現階段中所表現者，業經德宣傳部長郭培爾及軍需部長施別爾等闡明此種決意，即爲對於英美之精神戰所作之一致而日明確之回答，如軸心各國之國家集團當遭遇外部壓力時，却適足以增强彼此間之團結。英美兩國不論其於歐洲或東亞，每當企圖發動攻勢之時必受重大打擊，英美對於徵諸日德義三國以所作之回答，實應有所覺悟云。又德國民衆新聞亦論稱，徵諸日首相之有力聲明，亦足以再度證明日德義三國對於反軸心國之幻夢，已在事實上予以回答，今後大東亞新秩序之建設，已將漸次趨於具體化，而日首相所作將使菲島獨立之聲明，實將成爲重建東亞政治途徑之指針，關於大東亞共榮圈內之中滿泰緬及其他等國將來之幸福，於日政府之方針中，已予以保障。日政府謀增强與上述各國間之緊密關係，實與日軍之英勇作戰，具有同樣之重大實義。吾人以盟邦之立塲，對於日首相所稱渠確信歐洲盟邦之作戰，必可獲得成功，及闡明日本與歐洲盟邦作緊密速繫支援下共同作戰至獲得最後勝利而後止之決意，至爲欣悅云。</p>
<p>菲島印緬大爲感奮與日協力完遂戰爭</p>
<p>馬尼刺十七日中央社電　菲島行政長官伐爾加斯，十七日發表聲明如次：今日乃菲島民旅史上最幸福之一日，菲島人之深切感激，實非言語所能形容。蓋吾人獲悉日東條首相鑒明將於本年內予菲島以獨立榮譽後，已感激莫名。日本以如此直爽迅速且明確之聲明予菲島以獨立者，實即日本對菲島人之眞摯崇高，且爲親愛殷情之表現，菲島刻已有與日本和戰相共，同甘共苦之覺悟。爲期亞洲民族之勝利，菲島甘願將菲島所有之物質精神等資源，應日本之要求，貢獻於日本，且感覺此乃菲島人之無上光榮。當此菲島最重要之時期，菲島人倘有妨害吾等之獨立事業者，彼實不啻於菲島民族之崇高理想下，自招叛逆之惡名。又菲島人倘有希望再受英美之支配者，彼即係菲島將來新獨立國之不忠者。對於日本在其崇高理想下所賜與吾等之獨立，吾等謹願祈禱上帝，使此獨立成爲有價値之獨立。</p>
<p>馬尼刺十七日中央社電　新菲島服務團鑒於日東條首相此次於議會中闡明准許菲島獨立時期後，已使全菲島官民協力完遂大東亞戰爭之堅固決意益趨昂揚。特定於十八十九兩日假馬尼刺市內之首都劇塲，舉行全菲島服務團大會，屆時菲島行政府長官伐爾加斯及各部民官新菲島服務團副總裁阿基諾暨各州知事各地代表等均將出席參加。團結菲島一千六百萬民衆之總體，以闡明菲島爲響應東條首相聲明今後所採之方針。</p>
<p>仰光十七日中央社電　十五日爲此間印度獨立聯盟結成一週年紀念日，該聯盟經一年來之努力，其基礎與組織巳完全確立。緬甸二百萬印人，將以此第二年爲實行年度，決舉全力向達成反英獨立目的邁進。日東條首相會三次聲明支援印度獨立，此次更明確闡明「願盡一切手段，自印度驅涿英美勢力，完成印度之眞正獨立」之旨趣，使彼等異常感動。現當地印人有力者咸認印度之完全獨立，由此次日東條首相之聲明而觀，即將實現。同時全印度人爲答謝日政府之盛意，決舉全力從事最後之生存鬥爭。當地印獨立聯盟總裁喀里姆加尼氏十六日發表談話，大意謂，甘地自去年八月以來，即對英國展開不屈不撓之鬥爭，該鬥爭乃無武器者對持有殘酷武器者挑戰之鬥爭。我等東亞之印人同胞，爲救援祖國勇敢之同志，會作種種準備。日東條首相之聲明，使我等感無限興奮云。又緬甸亦與日本採同一步調，認應傾全力支援印度獨立，驅逐英美勢力。使印度獨立實現，乃緬甸完全獨立之軍大要素，緬甸印度之戰爭目的實完全相同云。</p>

<p>羅馬十七日中央社電　義國爲防備萬一事態，現正積極加强國內防衛措軒，義政府十六日對國民發出命令，謂若發現反軸心軍將兵間諜及有其嫌疑時者時，應立即向軍方或警察當局報吿。又該命令復規定義國民有對當局報吿有妨害國防行爲者之義務，隠匿嫌疑者或對之與以協力者，處以十年徒刑。</p>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　「柏林金融報」昨發表「東南歐之堡壘」一文，輪述巴爾幹之防衛力量，與反軸心軍在東南歐登陸之機會。略謂最近數週來，一般人皆自極北之那維克起，延伸至法西邊境之伊倫爲止，業已成立無敵之大西洋前綫。是以反軸心之唯一希望，祗有在東南歐登陸入侵，但果如此，則彼等之企圖必將使其覺悟，因忽視東南歐之主要變化而鑄成大錯。目前之局勢已不能再與一九一四年或一九一八年相比較，因巴爾幹久以歐洲之火藥庫著名，現已成爲東南歐之你壘也。今日之保加利亞在其國王鮑里斯領導之下，已準備保衛國王至最後一人：羅馬尼亞軍隊則　安托納斯古元帥指揮與德軍駢肩作戰；匈牙利之國隊亦已在目前戰爭中表現其英勇，對於任何侵犯歐洲者，自將作强有力之抵抗；南斯拉夫現已不復存在，塞爾維亞則正表示其對於在歐洲所負之責任，有日趨瞭解之趨勢；克羅地久遭壓迫，今已解放，實爲德國有力助手；而解放後之斯洛伐克亦擁有强大之陸軍，已在東綫方面有顯著之戰績。反軸心國如實行向東南歐進犯，必將感覺極端困難，因德義軍隊之陸守巴爾幹者，業已準備作有效之防禦矣。希臘爲德軍估領之逾兩載，現已成爲有特殊價値之橋頭堡，對於防守巴爾幹，有不少之便利。英軍在第一次巴爾幹戰役中，曾倉皇退至各海口狼狽遁去，今如再作登陸企圖，結果亦將遭遇同樣命運云。</p>

<p>瑞典京城十七日中央社電　蘇軍於奧勒爾東北地區實行突破作戰受挫後，德軍即乘機在姆資安斯克至貝列夫地區間六十五公里之戰綫上，突行開始總反攻。貝列夫地區布滿烟幕之蘇軍陣地，經德軍猛攻後，蘇軍似已撤退至薪陣地。惟據蘇情報局十六日上午發表公報稱，一已擊退德軍之反攻」云。文姆資安斯克西北郊外，德軍於有力之俯衝機隊掩護下，亦曾四次猛襲蘇軍主力戰綫，與堅守陣地之蘇軍展開機動戰甚烈，其後之戰况尙無報道。又姆資安斯克並巴拉克內亞南方塞夫斯克斯烏姆等地區，德蘇兩軍空戰極烈。又據德國通訊社消息，德空軍曾轟炸斯達羅培利斯克·希蒂格爾斯法托伏附近之蘇軍飛機塲，又曾痛炸伏羅希洛夫斯克·米由羅伏之鐵路設施，予以重大損害。</p>

<h3 id="c15">義國準備迎擊英美 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>（柏林特電十日加藤特派員發）本月十日是在偉大的試鋉中的義國參戰三周年的紀念日，突尼西亞的失陷，在德義不過只以爲是「邊境之戰」而已。英美的「進攻大陸」之呼聲，雖　是一種神經戰的武器，意在恐嚇義國民衆，但突尼西亞戰後英美空軍對義國各地的育炸，則日見激烈，連日對班太雷里亞，撒丁，西西里方面猛烈轟炸，是決不樂觀的情勢。六月七日英軍曾在蘭貝杜薩島試行登陸，被該島義防軍　退。這種試探的敵前登陸作戰，英國煩有繼續向班太雷里亞（譯者按義軍現已放棄），西西里劏試的可能性。義方對此當然已有允分的準備，縱使敵方不出以這種小規模的試探，而企圖用多數軍隊開闢第二戰綫，義方亦已完成了加以擊潰的準備。</p>
<p>五月中旬，軸心方面在突尼西亞停止抗戰的時候，記者恰在羅馬。義國民衆接到此盡痛的報吿後，並沒有出於想像之外地深刻的精神的影響。這當然因爲大家先已知道　白羅美爾將軍撤退以來的戰况於吾不利，而墨索里尼首相亦警吿準備應付　最惡劣的局勢。即是說，大家先已有了心的準備。故突尼西亞的失兒，一點也不感到人望和警詫。三年前義國表年在興奮中執戈而紀時，墨索里尼首相胸中所懷的秘密，姑作別論，但或許有人以爲這是短期戰者，一自對蘇戰爭開始，大東亞者編之爆發以來，變成了遍於全地球的眞正的世界戰，所以義人無不覺悟　這戰爭之世界史的重大性。在悠久的時日中。有光明的日子，亦有黑暗的日子，突尼西亞失陷以以來，義國　遭遇的局勢，和日德經起來，更爲困難，忍耐這困難的處境，而堅苦地完成抗戰，則最後軸心國之燦爛的勝昨利便可獲得。義國民衆的胸中，這種正視冷靜的現實的覺悟和決心，即從外面也可窺知，墨索里尼首相「重還非洲」的話，雖是悲痛的話，但隠藏着死而後已的氣概，這不是新興義國的精神嗎？</p>
<p>最近墨索里尼　首相吿訴民衆對敵人「應懷有神怪的憎厭」。把對敵人的憎厭　銘刻於胸中的話，即在德國，郭培爾宣傳部長也曾反復申述。英美方面把東方的日本，西方的德國當作正面之敵，視義國爲次要的，這無非是想把義國從　軸心陣營中割離出來的一種計劃，一面則專以空軍强壓，挫白義國民衆的戰鬥心，然而得到了相反的效果。拿波里，撒丁等受到盲炸地方的民心，從當地來的報吿淸楚地表　現着憎惡英美情緒的旺盛，英美向蘭貝杜薩的企圖何在，雖尙未明瞭，假定敵方計劃占據此島以爲窺　伺義國本土的立足點，那也顯然已經失敗了。我們姑暫勿論英美的企圖爲何。英美對義攻擊的方法　尤其是空炸，將愈趨激烈　　英美果眞要空襲羅馬嗎？　此問題，有着種種的　測，義國民衆鑒於英美之濫施區差別的空襲　覺悟到羅馬決　幸免，因而正在講求充足的防備。</p>
<p>義國現在立於國家　存亡的關頭。過去二十　未被法西主義鍜鋉的義國民衆，怎樣耐受這磨鋉呢？怎樣戰勝呢？敵方所加於蘭貝杜　島的攻擊被　退，正是遭遇難局的義大利之勝利的　預兆。我們盟邦國民，衷心祝福他們的勝利。（翔譯自六十二日西部每日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c16">反軸心攻歐將遭重大犧牲 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>據倫敦廣播消息，邱吉爾在八日的議支中關於　華盛頓會談的演說，並未涉及所期待的具體的結果，英國一般民衆深感不滿。但歐洲攻勢　疑　地是日趨迫切了。在種種臆測中，流傳着在法國北部登陸重說數，八日瑞典京城的來電，據柏林特派員的報道，德方對此的見解如次：</p>
<p>反軸心軍　即使企圖從英法海峽侵入法國北部，至少非五十萬兵力不可。擔任登陸作戰，一次須約五萬的兵力，第一次的登陸部隊，在橫斷英法　峽的時候，必須犧牲百分之廿五。假令約有三萬五千的兵力突　破德軍的機關槍綱，而在沿海在內地能確保一百至一百五十碼的橋頭堡，其次，第二次的登陸部隊　進達離岸二公里至五十公里的德軍要塞地帶　獲得砲兵陣地並阻止援兵的補充，這時候第一次的登　陸部隊約須損失半數，第三次的部隊約須損失百分之十五。同時，德軍之堅强的防禦陣，因可從背後增兵，故登陸軍將陷於險境，這時，第三次的登陸部隊進違沿岸，迫使尙在抵抗的德軍部隊後退，而在沿岸構築特別火綱。但這時候最初的二部中所殘存的不過一萬，第三次部　的損失或許較少　但三次合計所派　遺的反軸心軍在十五萬中祇乘五萬了。　五萬人，須得堅守至五英哩之長沿岸地帶。此後源源而來的一批一批軍隊，仍應將其海上的損失鈞入，在決定的戰鬥開始之前，至空須喪失三分之二。是以反軸心軍即欲獲得局部的成功，至少須動員九十師團即百八十萬的兵力。在這中間所受的犧牲，交爲他們之致命的打擊。</p>
<p>又反軸心軍無　論怎樣誇張其空軍的威力，但欲掌　英法海峽的制空權，則不可能，故如其把反軸心空軍的力　量估計得在此以上，那是錯誤的，（翔：譯自六月十二日西部每日　閱）</p>
<h3 id="c17">日軍在南方的建設動態 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>（〇〇基地　眞下特派員發）從新幾尼亞的東南部起，新不列顚，新愛爾蘭島等的俾斯麥羣島，在那裏有大小三十餘島所組成的蘇維門羣島，即係所謂東南太平洋一帶的機綫。這戰綫是大東亞戰爭決勝的地點，敵人正在頑强反攻，日本將士在海陸空各方面充滿着　飽滿的戰鬥精神而活躍。而有許多人則躍跟着這些勇士一同克服所有的惡　條件　從事開發，建設，與勇士們分担安勞苦，這些事實，我們不能加以輕視。</p>
<p>基地的建設</p>
<p>在〇〇寺廟，兵站期地的開發建設，正在着着進行。海軍局的直屬部隊　如司政官以次的水產，農林，牧畜，製材，土木建築等關係會社，選胎動其精銳派道遺到北地、盡分們所有的力量和技術，拚命建設。製木材關係的會社，踏進于古未經斧　的森林，做　從巨木的採伐以至製成木材的工作。</p>
<p>水產的蘊藏，豐富無比，南海的魚族，有極良好的成績。漁船所獲的競魚之多，實同意外。兵士們很喜歡　吃這種　魚的生魚片。</p>
<p>此外，在戰綫各地有設計隊，辛勒地勞動着從事於飛機塲，道路，橋樑的建設。及兵舍製造等基地的設計。人們往往因戰爭而連想到破壞，但相反地在原來無人居住的地方　積極建設起許多近代的設施。戰爭實可說是偉大的文化之建設。</p>
<p>海軍機的精神</p>

<p>繼由西野氏報吿田徑情形及預測，關於本市田徑選手，以中日德三國較多，義大利在足項下較多，於田徑項下則未有參加。大連方面由日滿選手合作，計有十五名，自十四日抵滬後，翌日即開始練習。上海方面參加者，共計二十七名，其比賽秩序，（一）千五百米賽，（二）撑竿跳，（三）百米，（四）鉛球，（五）跳選，（六）四百米，（七）鐵餅，（八）跳高，（九）五千米長跑，（十）標槍，（十一）四百米接力賽等，得分計算，除千五百米，五千米兩項取前三名外，接力賽取二名，分數冠軍得四分，亞軍得一分，其他田徑項目均取前四名，計首名得四分，二名得三分，三名得二分，四名得一分。</p>
<p>徑賽預測</p>
<p>繼就大連隊及滬　選手競賽預測而言，（百米）大連選手擁有福田（十秒記錄），日本杉田廣瀨（均十一秒十分之四）等，而滬隊最有希望爲木村隆氏，屆時福田與木村希望最濃，（四百米）大速有日本（記錄五十五秒），瀨口（五十三秒），遠藤（五十六秒）等。滬隊有伊凡諾夫久保田二氏，其記錄均在五十三秒，而近日久保之競習與瀨口之自始自終猛跑，及伊凡諾夫之後力堅强，三人均有激烈之取奪，（千五百米）大連隊瀨口，多田（四分三十秒記錄），迂，富永等以瀨口獲冠軍最有希望。次爲多田富永，（五千米）大連隊富永，　，瀨口（成績十六分），瀨與滬隊王正林及阿部三人競爭必烈，蓋近阿部成績精神好轉，成續突飛猛進，（四百米接力）福田土持，廣瀨，松田，達藤，日本，加藤，以福廣松加四人，最有把握，預測較難。</p>
<p>田賽預測</p>
<p>後述田賽預測，關於（一）跳遠部份，福田至今仍保持七米，而木村隆成績六米九六，二人相差無幾，爭鬬當更熱烈，（二）跳高，木村隆以一米九〇之成績，定有把握希望，惟福田亦不遜色，預測當爲二人爭取。（二）撑竿跳，大連阿部與城户三君最有把握，滬市恐無希望。（四）鐵餅，福田城戶加藤三君均在三十二至三十五米間，滬市選手派洛可，華烈柴，三本三君，亦在三十三至三十四五米間，鹿死誰手，頗難逆料。（五）鉛球，當將爲大連種勝，其成績在廿一十二米間。（六）標槍城戶，加藤福田雖保持五十米以上紀錄，而滬市有天學武，成績五十三米，最近猛習有可觀進步，此次田徑比賽，均採取嚴肅順序，屆時將莊嚴隆重。</p>
<p>足球情形</p>
<p>末由小川氏報吿足球籌備情形，首謂此次大會將足球比賽列入，意義頗深，且足球一項，尤爲全市中國一般民衆最感有興趣者，故足球爲團體運動，此次滬速埠際，均組成强有力球隊從事角逐，先就滬球編成經過而言，自十五日舉行預選，分紅白兩隊，由中日　義各國選手挑選對抗，即經選考委員會剔挑優秀球員後，乃吿成立。名單業經發表，惟綜觀實力以滬隊最優，華員有孫錦順戴麟經李天生等，且義海軍實力增厚，已選出五名。日本方面選西田坂谷二名，至大連隊以整個實力而言，亦謂不弱，蓋均由於個人之平均對衡力量發展。雖滬隊各球員有各之特長及技術，惟大連隊均抱具必勝信念頗堅，如滬隊一旦忽略，恐難取勝云。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3 id="c34">配給公共農具 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>實業部爲復興農林增加農產起見，特購置公共農具，配給各農業改進區，准當地農民申請租用。這樣一個措施，足以發揮以下幾個意義：（一）中國農民的刻苦耐勞木質與農業技術—至少在手的技術方面—是可以超過任何一個民族的：可是，中國農民的經濟狀况，却不允許他們自置各種應有盡有的農具。這是中國農村向來最大的缺陷，有待於我們來彌補的（二）「欲善其事，必先利其器。」中國農村中，即或有自置農具者，其農具亦多陳舊破損，勉强應用，影響農事上的人力與時間，正不可以計算。今以政府之資力，購置嶄新的公共農具，抑且規定農民於歸還時，必須完整無壞，即有損壞，亦必負責修理。所以，公共農具所能產生的工作効能，自必遠駕於私有農具之上，這是毫無疑義的。（三）農民租用公共農具的租價，僅以維持修理費用爲原則，如此則農民所費有限，所得甚多，其素來勤苦耐勞者，固覺格外興奮，益加努力，卽有懶惰成性，不事生產者，目睹農具在前，亦覺從農興趣，油然而生；無形中自足促進農事之活動，增加農業之生產，（四）原來，農業貸款之直接目的，固在於維持農民的日常生活，但其間接目的，亦即是最終的目的，却在於增加農產。農民租用農具旣須繳付租價，則其中無力繳付者，即可仰給於農業貸款，不至有望洋興歎之感。</p>
<p>此外，由於農民可以租用公共農具，因而想到同樣一個原則，也不妨施諸小型工業，藉以增加工業生產。說到今日的生產問題，原來是農工並重的。實業當局旣可購置公共農具，配給農業改進區，亦即可以購置公共工具，配給小型工廠區，因爲事實吿訴我們，許多小型工廠，也是因爲設備不周，器械不全，所以不能充分發揮其生產的能力。今之談工業國款者，似可對於此一問題，加以研究；同時，希望實業當局予以兼籌並顧，藉以增加戰時多方面的生產力量。</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Significance of the "Aid-Education Movement" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>What is the most important condition for the revitalization of China? We took this question to ask contemporary experts, scholars, and even practical politicians. Although the answers may not be consistent, we can assert that there is definitely no one who does not mention this one condition: "Talent!" "Talent!" "There must be sufficient talent!"</p>
<p>The revival of China or the construction of a new China that we hope for certainly requires political reform, that is, a perfect political organization and political program. However, what is more important is the people who promote political institutions and implement political programs. Therefore, the sages once said: "Having laws is not enough without people to govern." The reason why China's national power has declined in modern times is certainly due to the incomplete political reforms, but the most fundamental reason is the lack of true talent. If we look at the history of the past two or three decades, it cannot be said that there are absolutely no relatively complete political institutions or political systems, and it cannot be said that there is an absolute lack of relatively complete political programs and policies. However, those who can be strictly called "true talents," especially those who occupy the upper leadership positions, are really too few! As a result, all good political institutions, systems, programs, and policies cannot be promoted and implemented, and the country falls into decline day by day. Recalling the past, there is already a feeling of being overwhelmed by the scarcity of talent, and looking around at the present, it is felt that the work of cultivating talent has not been fully exerted, and looking forward to the future of the country, one cannot but make those with aspirations sleepless!</p>
<p>We believe that whether it is during the war or in preparation for post-war construction, there are many undertakings that the government must undertake, but they cannot be launched immediately because there is no suitable talent. There are also many undertakings that have been launched, but because of the lack of sufficient and suitable talent, they are stalled or fail to achieve the expected results. This phenomenon is equally evident not only in the government, but also in the financial, economic, business, and cultural sectors. Therefore, the reason why various undertakings are finally shelved and cannot be realized is often the lack of talent and the difficulty of obtaining talent.</p>
<p>The serious phenomenon of talent shortage today can be said to be the result of backward education, especially the lack of universal education, in the past ten or twenty years. We want to ask, what will be the construction of China in ten or twenty years? What will the fate of the country be? Then we must look at the current situation of talent cultivation? To what extent has today's education been universalized? Those who look at the present will also be like those who look at the past. So, looking forward to the future, can we not worry about the fate of the country? Therefore, how to popularize education and accelerate the cultivation of talent is the most urgent task today. Otherwise, without talent, no perfect political institutions, programs, policies, or even business plans can be realized. The responsibility for popularizing education certainly lies with the relevant government authorities, but from the current actual situation in our country, due to the expansion of the national wartime finance, we cannot completely expect the government to take full responsibility for education and talent cultivation. We must awaken far-sighted people and powerful people in the private sector, and everyone must be inspired to cooperate with the government, improve and enrich educational institutions, and expand the talent cultivation movement. Therefore, the significance of the "scholarship" movement we have held over the years dares to be attached to this.</p>
<p>The important significance of our newspaper's scholarship has actually been deeply recognized by people from all walks of life. We see enthusiastic people in society donating their salaries to help education, selling property to help education, and jointly helping education collectively with relatives and friends. There are also many students in school who are enthusiastically participating in the aid-education movement. This spirit of warm mutual assistance is deeply engraved in our minds and also in the glorious history of the construction of the future new China.</p>
<p>From the year-by-year increase in the number of people participating in the righteous act of helping education and the amount of donations, we can prove the increased awareness of people in society regarding the righteous act of helping education. The increase in the number of students receiving assistance can also make us excited, because our efforts have not been in vain, and we can also encourage other cultural groups to work hard in the aid-education movement. We firmly believe that as long as everyone works hard to promote it, it will definitely have an inestimable benefit to the future of the country and society.</p>
<p>Now this semester has come to an end, and the aid-education affairs for the next semester are about to begin. From the actual situation, due to the high prices, schools may inevitably increase fees. In the next semester, I don’t know how much the number of people who cannot afford to continue their studies will increase! I don’t know how many people who are preparing to enroll will be deterred! We cannot bear to see a large number of young people wandering outside the school gate or even on the streets because of insufficient funding for schooling. For the sake of the future of the country and society, and for the nation to stand in the future world, every one of us in society has the responsibility to do our best to help children, teenagers, and young people to be able to go to school. Taking Shanghai as an example, if each relatively wealthy person can specially save more than ten yuan, then millions of yuan can be collected in a short period of time, which can make thousands of young people worry-free from dropping out of school! Therefore, we are more actively organizing the scholarship movement, and we are more eagerly hoping that all sectors of society will rise up together and donate enthusiastically.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Clarifies the Essence of Japan's Diplomatic Policy: Establishing Good Neighborly Relations with China Based on Equality and Mutual Benefit; Seeking the Liberation of All Ethnic Groups to Build a Greater East Asia <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Shigemitsu of Japan, in response to the question raised by Representative Masataka Ota in the general budget meeting of the House of Representatives on the 17th, "What is the international impact of the Empire's Greater East Asia policy and how can it be utilized?" clarified the essence of Japan's diplomatic policy for the first time since taking office as follows: Prime Minister Tojo, in his speech yesterday, already clarified the Empire's unwavering grand policy, which is to permanently liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of the United Kingdom and the United States and restore its original form. Today, the one billion people of East Asia are convinced that without the victory of the Greater East Asia War, there will be no liberation of Greater East Asia; without the construction of Greater East Asia, there will be no welfare for the people of Greater East Asia. It is time for us to give spiritual support and cooperation to the demands of the people of Greater East Asia. Therefore, regarding the matter of restoring Greater East Asia to its original form, we have repeatedly stated its specific plan, which is to grant complete independence to each country or allow it to participate extensively in politics to achieve its hopes, and to establish cooperative good neighborly relations on the basis of mutual equality and benefit. Based on this view, we will build East Asia and defend against those who disturb the stability and peace of East Asia. The so-called realization of the long-awaited national states in the Greater East Asia region, cooperating with each other on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, has been gradually realized in the new policy towards China, which is to re-explore the new relationship between China and Japan and establish good neighborly relations between the two countries. The Empire's policy is to thoroughly implement this policy, spread its spirit throughout Greater East Asia, and seek the unity of one billion people, which is also the true construction of Greater East Asia. This policy is the spirit of the Empire since its founding and the spirit of ancient times, but although it is so ancient, it is also an extremely new problem.</p>
<p>Summarizing International Relations and Exposing the Ambitions of the United Kingdom and the United States</p>
<p>What is new about relations, I would like to state here in terms of national festival relations. You should know that the Eastern policy of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, and other countries is a policy of division and rule. Speaking of the United Kingdom, its policy towards India is to alienate them and rule them, and its policy towards the European continent is a policy of balance of power. In East Asia, it is to alienate China and Japan and make them fight each other, because it does not want a strong country to exist in East Asia. Their policy often aims to disrupt and satisfy their political ambitions, so it is fundamentally a destructive policy. Eliminating this destructive policy and its elements and building the grand vision of Greater East Asia is the Empire's grand policy. Also, what is the economic policy they adopt, especially their colonial policy? Their policy is to occupy the colony and then seal it off and seize its benefits, which is fundamentally different from the Empire's advocated policy of liberating resources, mutual benefit, and equality. What is their policy towards China, what is their policy towards India, and what is their policy towards Asia? This is an extremely clear fact in economic terms. Without eliminating these political and economic clutches, the path of construction cannot be opened up. In the past, the Empire made the greatest efforts to realize the grand spirit since its founding, but it often encountered various difficulties. What are the reasons why it was not easy to fully promote this spirit in the past? There are various reasons, which are not easy to explain simply.</p>
<p>Using Force to Remove the Clutches and Open Up the Path of Construction</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the overall situation, the intrusion of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other forces into East Asia is inherently destructive, exerting its disruptive effect. The clutches of the United Kingdom and the United States have been gradually removed through the Empire's extraordinary efforts and struggles, that is, they have been removed by the direct force of our army, navy, and air force. Here, the path of construction is opened up. The construction of Greater East Asia is the expression of the loyal spirit since the founding of the country, and the protection of this spirit is the Empire's military force. If these clutches continue to exist in the future, we must always engage in defending Greater East Asia. This defense is carried out by the automatic cooperation of all countries and ethnic groups in the Greater East Asia region. In fact, as mentioned earlier, the liberation of Asia is our national policy. If we do not liberate Greater East Asia and free it from the exploitation of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries, Asia cannot be stable, and it is not enough to talk about building Greater East Asia. Now Asia is no longer a colony of the United Kingdom and the United States, and the policies of the United Kingdom and the United States often encounter reefs, all because exploitation and monopoly eventually lead to economic warfare. Although they claim that war is not an instrument of policy, they openly declare economic warfare to force other countries to submit, such as the freezing of funds, which is one example. If the freezing continues to the end, war cannot but occur. It is not necessary to repeat the causes of the Greater East Asia War. The United Kingdom and the United States are not friends of the countries and ethnic groups in East Asia, but our enemies. Looking at the recent situation in the West, we can see that the Axis powers of Germany and Italy are protecting the various small countries in reality. The United Kingdom and the United States flaunt great powerism and do not want the interests of small countries to be like this. Summarizing the international relations, our country's grand policy towards Greater East Asia is to liberate Asia and build Greater East Asia. This is a construction policy that is different from the disruptive and destructive policies of the United Kingdom and the United States. This is of great significance to all ethnic groups and countries, especially the ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. A policy that conforms to this justice will surely be understood by the world, and the enemy may also understand this policy and submit to this meaning. We must promote this policy to complete the war. I believe that the future of the Empire's participation in this war, existing as a major power, also lies in its ability to promote a policy based on justice. I believe that it can bring dawn to Asia and complete the construction of Greater East Asia, which is the great foundation for the permanent happiness and peace of the world.</p>
<p>President Wang, who is also the President of the Executive Yuan, Issues a Statement Thanking Allied Nations for Their Profound Friendship</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - After Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech in the Japanese Diet on the 16th, officials and civilians in our country were excited and more convinced of the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the coexistence and co-prosperity of the East Asian peoples, and especially welcomed and paid attention to Prime Minister Tojo's kindness in "fundamentally revising the existing treaties between China and Japan." Wang, who is also the President of the Executive Yuan, specially issued a statement on this matter, which was released in full by Minister of Propaganda Lin to domestic and foreign reporters in the capital at 3:00 p.m. on the 17th as follows: "At the time of the opening of the Diet of the Allied Empire of Japan, the policy speech delivered by Prime Minister Tojo is a concrete revelation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Doctrine, and the purpose of the Greater East Asia War is even clearer here. I am convinced that all the countries and ethnic groups in East Asia will be more determined in their faith in their own future and in the overall situation of East Asia upon hearing this speech, and the unity of the East Asian peoples will be as solid as a rock. This Greater East Asia War, as its name suggests, is actually for the East Asian peoples to seek liberation for themselves, and there is no intention of invading other continents. However, for a hundred years, the United Kingdom and the United States have harbored ambitions to invade the world, especially East Asia as their colony, and therefore promoted this war. All the countries and ethnic groups in East Asia should stand on the same front as fellow East Asians and never allow the existence of even one East Asian traitor. Since the Allied Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, it has fundamentally swept away the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Southeast Pacific region and has established the foundation for certain victory. The recent death in battle of Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and the collective martyrdom of the defending troops on Attu Island further demonstrate to the East Asian peoples a model of achieving their ambitions at the cost of their lives. Not only are all the soldiers and civilians of the Allied Japan in tension, but all the East Asian peoples feel the same way. Now Prime Minister Tojo has decided in the Diet of the Empire to support the countries and ethnic groups in East Asia so that they can permanently escape the shackles of the United Kingdom and the United States and fulfill their long-cherished wish to love their country, love their neighbors, and love East Asia together. The countries and ethnic groups in East Asia are grateful and excited upon hearing this virtuous sound, and they are encouraged to jointly advance with a spirit of inevitability. Moreover, the depth of friendship, the earnestness of expectation, and the increasing strength of assistance to China allow the Chinese government and all the people to feel inspired. Since the Allied Japan first returned the concessions and abolished extraterritoriality on January 9 this year in order to assist China in completing its independence, it has made the Chinese people feel the brightness of the future and increased their infinite courage. Now, taking a further step, it will fundamentally revise the treaties signed between China and Japan, which will greatly enhance the friendly relations between China and Japan. The main principle of the treaties signed between the National Government and the Allied Japan since the return of the capital is to enable China and Japan to cooperate and jointly devote themselves to the construction of a new East Asian order based on morality. This principle is permanently indelible. However, in the meantime, considering the environment at the time, the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States took the opportunity to invade and肆害.There had to be expedient measures, now that the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States have been swept away and the environment has changed, thereby making a decisive revision so that China can exert its overall strength in military and economic terms, complete its unification, and contribute its national strength to the Greater East Asia War. In addition to thanking the Allied Japan for its profound friendship, we can only work harder to move forward in order to realize the joint efforts of China and Japan and complete the purpose of the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The Three Axis Powers Are Closely Linked, and the Belief in Ultimate Victory Is Even Stronger</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - All circles in Germany attach great importance to the policy speech delivered by Prime Minister Tojo of Japan at the Diet. Dr. Schmidt stated the main points of Prime Minister Tojo's speech at the regular meeting of reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 16th, and expressed special importance to Prime Minister Tojo's statement that he was convinced that the powerful war being waged by the Allied countries in Europe would be successful and that Japan would fight to the end with the close support of its allies to reduce the determination of the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition to publishing Prime Minister Tojo's speech in major newspapers on the evening of the 16th, German newspapers have also commented on it. For example, the Berliner Abendblatt stated, "There is no doubt that the Tripartite Pact will be victorious." The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung stated that the Secretary-General of the Italian Fascist Party had previously clarified that the Italian people were determined to fight until they achieved ultimate victory, and today Prime Minister Tojo reiterated his determination to fight with the close support of the Allied countries in Europe until they secured a joint victory. The determination expressed by the German people at the current stage of the world war has been clarified by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Armaments Minister Speer, which is a consistent and increasingly clear answer to the spiritual war waged by the United Kingdom and the United States. When the national groups of the Axis powers encounter external pressure, it is enough to enhance their unity with each other. The United Kingdom and the United States will suffer major blows whenever they attempt to launch an offensive in Europe or East Asia. The United Kingdom and the United States should be aware of the answer given by the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy, and should be aware of it. Also, the German National News commented that Prime Minister Tojo's powerful statement is also sufficient to prove once again that the dreams of the anti-Axis powers have been answered in fact. In the future, the construction of the new East Asian order will gradually become concrete, and the statement made by Prime Minister Tojo that he will make the Philippines independent will become a guideline for rebuilding the political path in East Asia. Regarding the future happiness of China, Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, and other countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it has been guaranteed in the policy of the Japanese government. The Japanese government's plan to strengthen its close relations with the aforementioned countries has the same important meaning as the heroic operations of the Japanese army. We, from the standpoint of an ally, are very pleased with Prime Minister Tojo's statement that he is convinced that the operations of the European allies will be successful and that Japan will fight to the end with the close support of the European allies until they achieve ultimate victory.</p>
<p>The Philippines, India, and Burma Are Greatly Excited and Cooperate with Japan to Complete the War</p>
<p>Manila, 17th (Central News Agency) - Philippine Executive Director Vargas issued the following statement on the 17th: Today is one of the happiest days in the history of the Philippine people, and the deep gratitude of the Philippine people cannot be described in words. We are grateful to learn that Prime Minister Tojo of Japan has made it clear that he will grant the Philippines the honor of independence this year. Japan's granting of independence to the Philippines with such a straightforward, rapid, and clear statement is a manifestation of Japan's sincere, noble, and affectionate expression to the Philippine people. The Philippines is now aware that it will share weal and woe with Japan in war and peace. For the sake of the victory of the Asian peoples, the Philippines is willing to contribute all its material and spiritual resources to Japan at the request of Japan, and feels that this is the supreme glory of the Philippine people. At this most important time for the Philippines, if there is anyone who hinders our independence, he is tantamount to betraying the lofty ideals of the Philippine people. Also, if there is anyone who hopes to be dominated by the United Kingdom and the United States again, he is a traitor to the future new independent country of the Philippines. For the independence granted to us by Japan under its lofty ideals, we pray to God that this independence will become a valuable independence.</p>
<p>Manila, 17th (Central News Agency) - The New Philippine Service Corps, in view of Prime Minister Tojo's clarification in the Diet of the timing of allowing the Philippines to become independent, has made the firm determination of all Philippine officials and civilians to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War even more vigorous. It has been decided to hold a general meeting of the New Philippine Service Corps on the 18th and 19th at the Capital Theater in Manila. The head of the Philippine Executive Government, Vargas, the deputy director of the New Philippine Service Corps, Aquino, and governors and representatives from various states will attend. The total of 16 million people in the Philippine Islands will be united to clarify the policies adopted by the Philippines in response to Prime Minister Tojo's statement in the future.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 17th (Central News Agency) - The 15th was the first anniversary of the establishment of the Indian Independence League here. After a year of efforts, its foundation and organization have been completely established. The 2 million Indians in Burma will take this second year as the year of implementation and will devote all their efforts to achieving the goal of anti-British independence. Prime Minister Tojo of Japan has stated three times that he will support India's independence. This time, he has clearly clarified that "he is willing to use all means to drive the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States out of India and complete India's true independence," which has deeply moved them. The powerful local Indians believe that the complete independence of India will be realized by Prime Minister Tojo's statement this time. At the same time, all the Indians are determined to devote all their efforts to the final struggle for survival to thank the Japanese government for its kindness. Karim Gani, the president of the Indian Independence League here, gave a speech on the 16th, which meant that Gandhi has launched an unyielding struggle against Britain since August last year. This struggle is a struggle between those without weapons and those with cruel weapons. Our fellow Indians in East Asia will make various preparations to rescue the brave comrades in their homeland. Prime Minister Tojo's statement has made us feel infinitely excited. Burma has also adopted the same pace as Japan and believes that it should devote all its efforts to supporting India's independence and driving out the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States. The realization of India's independence is a major element of Burma's complete independence. The war goals of Burma and India are completely the same.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Supreme National Defense Conference Approves the Restoration of the National Central Research Institute: The Future of Culture Will Be Even Brighter <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Supreme National Defense Conference held its 18th meeting on the morning of the 17th and passed many important cases. The most important items include: (1) It was resolved to restore the National Central Research Institute, change the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee of the Executive Yuan to the National Central Research Institute, and the members of the committee will be the ex officio members of the preparatory committee for the restoration of the National Central Research Institute. Another 8 to 12 members will be hired, and the organizational regulations of the preparatory committee for the restoration of the National Central Research Institute will be formed separately. In addition to the members of the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee being ex officio members, Zhou Zuoren, Su Tiren, Qian Daosun, Zhang Tingquan (of Peking University), Hu Dunfu (of Jiaotong University), Lin Ruheng (of Datong University), Zhao Zhengping (of Guanghua University), and Chen Huangyong (of Shanghai University) will be added as members, and Chu Minyi will be designated as the chairman. (2) Committee Member Chen Qun was elected as a member of the National Government and designated as the director of the National History Compilation Committee. (3) Liang Guobin was appointed as a specialist member of the Economic Committee of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The 18th Supreme National Defense Conference resolved to reorganize the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee, a cultural organization directly under the Executive Yuan, into the National Central Research Institute, and the original members will be the ex officio members of the preparatory committee for the Central Research Institute. Eight people including Zhou Zuoren and others have been added as preparatory committee members. Zhou Zuoren is a master in the Chinese cultural circles and has high expectations. Su Tiren is also a famous cultural figure in the northern provinces and is responsible for the educational administration of the four provinces and three cities in North China. Qian, Zhang, Hu, Lin, and Zhao are all current university presidents, and Chen Huangyong is a former professor at National Sun Yat-sen University. After the incident, he single-handedly preserved plant specimens and traveled to Hong Kong and Guangdong. He was recognized by the government last year, and now the addition of these eight people to the lineup is quite impressive. The future of our country's culture and the research of cultural relics will be even brighter, and all parties attach great importance to this. According to the pre-incident, there was a National Central Research Institute, which played a very large role. Now the National Government has decided to restore it, and its development is worth looking forward to.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Italy Is Actively Strengthening Domestic Defense to Prepare for Any Eventuality; Southeastern Europe Has Become a Strong Bastion of the Axis; Any Landing Attempt by Britain and the United States Will Be Strongly Repulsed <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 17th (Central News Agency) To prepare for any eventuality, Italy is actively strengthening its domestic defenses. The Italian government issued an order to the people on the 16th, stating that if any soldiers, spies, or suspected individuals of the anti-Axis forces are discovered, they should be reported to the military or police authorities immediately. The order also stipulates that Italian citizens have an obligation to report to the authorities any behavior that harms national defense. Those who conceal suspects or assist them will be sentenced to ten years of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) The "Berlin Financial News" published an article yesterday entitled "The Fortress of Southeastern Europe," discussing the defensive strength of the Balkans and the chances of the anti-Axis forces landing in Southeastern Europe. It stated that in recent weeks, an invincible Atlantic front has been established, extending from Narvik in the far north to Irun on the French border. Therefore, the only hope for the anti-Axis forces is to land and invade in Southeastern Europe. But if they do, their attempt will make them realize that they have made a serious mistake by ignoring the major changes in Southeastern Europe. The current situation can no longer be compared with 1914 or 1918, because the Balkans, long known as the powder keg of Europe, has now become the fortress of Southeastern Europe. Today's Bulgaria, under the leadership of its King Boris, is prepared to defend the country to the last man. The Romanian army, under the command of Marshal Antonescu, fights shoulder to shoulder with the German army. The Hungarian army has also shown its bravery in the current war and will strongly resist any invaders of Europe. Yugoslavia no longer exists, and Serbia is showing an increasing understanding of its responsibilities in Europe. Croatia, which has long been oppressed, is now liberated and is a powerful assistant to Germany. And the liberated Slovakia also has a strong army that has achieved significant results on the Eastern Front. If the anti-Axis countries invade Southeastern Europe, they will find it extremely difficult, as the German and Italian troops defending the Balkans are prepared for an effective defense. Greece, occupied by the German army for more than two years, has now become a bridgehead of special value, with many advantages for defending the Balkans. In the first Balkan War, the British army hastily retreated to various ports and fled in embarrassment. If they attempt to land again, they will suffer the same fate.</p>
<h3 id="e10">On the Orel Front, the German Army Launched a General Counter-Offensive <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency) After the Soviet army's breakthrough operation in the northeast of Orel was frustrated, the German army took the opportunity to launch a general counter-offensive on the 65-kilometer front between Mtsensk and Belev. The Soviet positions in the Belev area, covered with smoke, seem to have retreated to new positions after a fierce German attack. However, according to a communiqué issued by the Soviet Information Bureau on the morning of the 16th, "the German counter-offensive has been repulsed." Northwest of Mtsensk, under the cover of powerful dive bombers, the German army also launched four fierce attacks on the main Soviet line, engaging in fierce mobile warfare with the Soviet army defending its positions. There have been no reports on the situation since then. In the areas of Mtsensk, south of Balakleya, and Sevsk, the air battles between the German and Soviet armies were extremely fierce. According to the German news agency, the German air force bombed Soviet airfields near Starobelsk, Shitigersfahtovo, and also bombed the railway facilities in Voroshilovgrad and Milerovo, causing significant damage.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) German News Agency military correspondent Harenslimu declared: Since the situation on the Eastern Front began over four months ago, except for slight changes in the positions of both sides, the general situation remains as before. The German command is taking advantage of the current relatively calm opportunity to add new divisions to reinforce the Eastern Front. Various new equipment and new weapons have further strengthened the firepower of the German army. The correspondent pointed out that the mechanized equipment of the German army on the Eastern Front has reached such a level that it can be called a "wheel front." The enemy's efforts should not be underestimated. Certain signs reveal that the enemy seems to be most concerned about the Kursk area, as the enemy's transportation movements in that area have been very tense in the past few days. German military circles do not want to comment on the German countermeasures, but it can be predicted that the German army is preparing a deep, terraced defense line along the entire front to use flash speed to intercept any offensive actions by the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e11">The Turkish Prime Minister Reaffirmed His Neutrality <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Istanbul, 17th (Central News Agency) The Sixth Congress of the Turkish Republican People's Party, which began on the 8th of this month, lasted for eight days and closed on the 15th. At the closing ceremony, Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu delivered a speech, clarifying the Turkish government's domestic and foreign policies, and reaffirmed Turkey's adherence to its policy of neutrality. The main points are as follows: (1) Foreign policy: In the past four years, the Turkish government has faced imminent war several times, but thanks to the government's consistent foreign policy and the nation's spirit of sacrifice, the Turkish people have been spared from these dangers of war. Looking at the Turkish government's diplomatic relations with various countries, it is clear that the friendly relations between Turkey and the Soviet Union have become closer due to the treaty signed between the two countries. Both countries are faithfully abiding by the treaty. Moreover, the treaty between Turkey and Britain has a long term and a large scope, and there have been talks with British Foreign Secretary Eden and Prime Minister Churchill, which is proof that the views of Turkey and Britain are completely consistent. In addition, the non-aggression treaty concluded with Germany is based on the interests of both Turkey and Germany. This treaty will create conditions that are even more beneficial to both countries. In light of this, what completely protects Turkey from the dangers of war is the Turkish government's foreign policy, which is based on national unity and a strong army. (2) Domestic policy: At the beginning of this war, the Turkish government immediately started to pay its members. In the past three years, the Turkish government's budgeted amount reached 486 million Turkish pounds, and the temporary expenditure amount reached 500 million Turkish pounds. Because a bumper harvest is expected this year, the increase in revenue from agricultural products next year will rise to 1 billion Turkish pounds. The government has not obtained any revenue from domestic ethnic minorities and foreigners, but if difficulties are encountered in the future, taxes will also be levied on these residents.</p>

<p>The Minister of Commerce Details the Current Situation of the Mining Industry in North China</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) At the Budget General Meeting of the House of Representatives on the 17th, the Minister of Commerce, Mr. Kishi, responded to the inquiry of Representative Tanaka regarding the current situation of the mining industry in North Central China, stating: Regarding the utilization of the Yantien iron ore, development is being actively promoted, and a portion has already been transported to Japan and Manchuria. Regarding the on-site iron smelting work in North China, Sun plans to move Japanese factories and equipment there and start iron smelting in Shijingshan. At the same time, small smelting furnaces are being set up in North China and Mengjiang to strengthen the local iron smelting industry. A portion has already been completed and plans are being made. A small smelting furnace has been set up in Qingdao, Shandong Province, with the aim of making full use of local iron ore. The iron ore resources on the Yangtze River coast have long been used. A large part of this year's iron ore production plan relies on iron ore produced in Japan and along the Yangtze River. The iron ore on Hainan Island is of excellent quality, and development is proceeding faster than planned.</p>
<p>Improving Important Enterprises and Strengthening Combat Power</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) At the session of the Enterprise Improvement Committee of the House of Representatives on the 17th, the Minister of Commerce, Mr. Kishi, responded to the questions of Representatives Koyama and Funada by detailing the following four points: (1) the basic policy for enterprise improvement, (2) the improvement between industrial departments, (3) the improvement of the distribution mechanism, and (4) the improvement of the control work. When explaining the basic policy of enterprises, he further pointed out that its purpose is to mobilize the entire industrial power and concentrate it on enhancing combat power. The gist is that this enterprise improvement is not adopting a passive improvement due to lack of raw materials. Its purpose is to mobilize the entire industrial power of Japan and concentrate it on enhancing combat power, so its nature is positive. Therefore, the target of improvement is not limited to the peace industry. The biggest focus of the improvement is on improving the key industrial sectors in order to effectively utilize the factory equipment and labor transferred from other sectors. Therefore, a fundamental restructuring of the content, technology, and organization of key industrial sectors is an urgent task at present.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) At the session of the Enterprise Improvement Committee of the House of Representatives on the morning of the 17th, the Minister of Commerce, Mr. Kishi, and the Minister of Greater East Asia, Mr. Aoki, responded to the question of Representative Ryogoro Kato by explaining the government's policy on improving the weaving industry and moving it to the South as follows: (1) The improvement of the textile industry sector will continue to ensure the supply of infant products. (2) The clothing problem in the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere will also establish a certain clothing plan on the same plan as the material support, so that its export volume can be the same as last year. In addition, a certain relocation plan has been established for the plan to relocate domestic spinning mills, and it is currently being carried out in the Philippines and Java. Weaving machines related to spinning will also be relocated. In addition, the second and third relocation policies have been decided. (3) Although the cotton produced in northern China is not necessarily optimistic, this is because it needs to be solved in combination with the food problem, so we are currently working on research. (4) The procedure for improving the textile industry is that in the cotton, artificial fiber, spinning, and other departments, about 40% of the work is done, 30% or 40% is preserved, and the remaining 20% is transferred or abolished. In addition, about 40% to 50% of the same fabric is still working, 20% is preserved, and the remaining 40% is abolished.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Italy Is Preparing to Repel Britain and the United States <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Berlin, 10th, by Special Correspondent Kato) The 10th of this month marked the third anniversary of Italy's participation in the war, a great test. The loss of Tunisia is regarded by Germany and Italy as "merely a border war." Although the calls for "invading the continent" by Britain and the United States are a weapon of psychological warfare intended to intimidate the Italian people, the bombing of various parts of Italy by the British and American air forces after the Tunisian war has become increasingly fierce. The continuous heavy bombing of Pantelleria, Sardinia, and Sicily is by no means an optimistic situation. On June 7, the British army attempted a landing on the island of Lampedusa, but was repelled by the Italian garrison on the island. The British may continue to try such probing, enemy-before-landing operations on Pantelleria (translator's note: the Italian army has now abandoned it) and Sicily. The Italian side, of course, has made sufficient preparations for this. Even if the enemy does not attempt such small-scale probing, but attempts to open up a second front with a large number of troops, the Italian side has completed preparations to defeat them.</p>
<p>In mid-May, when the Axis forces stopped fighting in Tunisia, I was in Rome. After receiving this painful report, the Italian people did not experience an unexpectedly deep spiritual impact. This was naturally because everyone already knew that the situation since General Rommel's retreat was unfavorable to us, and Prime Minister Mussolini had warned us to prepare for the worst situation. That is to say, everyone had made mental preparations in advance. Therefore, the loss of Tunisia did not cause much surprise or panic. Three years ago, when Italy entered the war in excitement, Prime Minister Mussolini's secret thoughts were another matter, but some people may have thought that this was a short-term war. Since the beginning of the war against the Soviet Union and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has become a true world war that covers the entire globe, so all Italians are aware of the historical significance of this war. In the long run, there are bright days and dark days. Since the loss of Tunisia, the situation encountered by Italy has been more difficult than that of Japan and Germany. Enduring this difficult situation and completing the war of resistance with hardship will eventually lead to the brilliant victory of the Axis powers. In the hearts of the Italian people, this awareness and determination to face the cold reality can be seen from the outside. Prime Minister Mussolini's words "Return to Africa" are sad, but they hide the spirit of dying after death. Is this not the spirit of the new Italy?</p>
<p>Recently, Prime Minister Mussolini told the people to "have a demonic hatred for the enemy." The Minister of Propaganda Goebbels also repeatedly stated this in Germany, inscribing the hatred for the enemy in their hearts. By regarding Japan in the East and Germany in the West as the main enemies, and viewing Italy as secondary, the British and American sides are simply trying to sever Italy from the Axis camp. On the one hand, they are using air power to suppress the fighting spirit of the Italian people, but this has had the opposite effect. Reports from Naples, Sardinia, and other places that have been blindly bombed clearly show the strong emotions of hatred for Britain and the United States. Although it is not yet clear what the British and American intentions are in attacking Lampedusa, assuming that the enemy plans to occupy this island as a foothold for spying on the Italian mainland, it has obviously failed. We will not discuss the intentions of Britain and the United States for the time being. The methods of attack by Britain and the United States, especially air raids, will become more and more fierce. Will Britain and the United States really bomb Rome? There are all sorts of speculations about this question. The Italian people, given the indiscriminate bombing of Britain and the United States, realize that Rome will not be spared and are therefore seeking adequate defenses.</p>
<p>Italy now stands at a critical juncture for the survival of the nation. How will the Italian people, who have been forged by Fascism for the past twenty years, endure this磨鋉 [torment/grinding]? How will they win? The repulse of the enemy's attack on the island of Lampedusa is a harbinger of victory for Italy in the face of difficulties. We, the people of the allied nations, sincerely wish them victory. (Translated by Xiang from the 62nd Western Daily News)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Anti-Axis Offensive in Europe Will Incur Great Sacrifices <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>According to a broadcast from London, Churchill's speech in the House of Commons on the 8th regarding the Washington talks did not mention any expected concrete results, and the British public generally felt dissatisfied. But an offensive in Europe is undoubtedly becoming increasingly imminent. Amid various speculations, there are rumors of a landing in northern France. A dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden on the 8th, citing a report from a Berlin correspondent, states the German view on this as follows:</p>
<p>Even if the anti-Axis forces attempt to invade northern France from the English Channel, they must have at least 500,000 troops. About 50,000 troops must be used for the landing operation. The first landing force must sacrifice 25% when crossing the English Channel. Assuming that about 35,000 troops break through the German machine gun nets and can secure a bridgehead of 100 to 150 yards along the coast and inland, then the second landing force will reach the German fortress area two kilometers to fifty kilometers from the shore to obtain artillery positions and prevent the replenishment of reinforcements. At this time, about half of the first landing force will be lost, and the third landing force will be lost by about 15%. At the same time, because the German army's strong defensive positions can be reinforced from behind, the landing army will be in a dangerous situation. At this time, the third landing force will enter the coast, forcing the German troops who are still resisting to retreat, and build a special fire net on the coast. But at this time, only 10,000 of the original two units remain. The loss of the third unit may be less, but the total number of anti-Axis forces dispatched in three units is only 50,000 out of 150,000. 50,000 people must defend the five-mile-long coastal area. After that, batch after batch of troops should still include their losses at sea. Before the decisive battle begins, at least two-thirds must be lost. Therefore, if the anti-Axis forces want to achieve even local success, they must mobilize at least 90 divisions, that is, 1.8 million troops. The sacrifices made in the middle will be a fatal blow to them.</p>
<p>In addition, no matter how exaggerated the anti-Axis forces are about the power of their air force, it is impossible for them to control the airspace of the English Channel. Therefore, it is wrong to estimate the strength of the anti-Axis air force above this. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Daily News, June 12)</p>
<h3 id="e17">Construction Progress of the Japanese Army in the South <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(〇〇 Base, Special Correspondent Mashi) From the southeastern part of New Guinea, through New Britain, New Ireland, and the Bismarck Archipelago, to the Solomon Islands, composed of over thirty islands, lies the so-called air route in the southeastern Pacific. This battle line is the decisive location for the Greater East Asia War. The enemy is putting up a stubborn resistance, and Japanese soldiers are active on all fronts—sea, land, and air—filled with abundant fighting spirit. Many people are following these brave warriors, overcoming all adverse conditions to engage in development and construction, sharing the hardships with the soldiers. We cannot underestimate these facts.</p>
<p>Construction of the Base</p>
<p>The development and construction of the 〇〇 temple and supply base are steadily progressing. Naval Bureau direct units, such as civil administration officials, and related companies in fisheries, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, lumbering, and civil engineering, are selecting their elite and dispatching them to the northern lands, dedicating all their strength and technology to desperate construction. Lumber companies are venturing into forests untouched by axes since ancient times, undertaking everything from logging giant trees to processing lumber.</p>
<p>The marine resources are incomparably rich. The fish species of the South Seas are yielding excellent results. The amount of fish caught by fishing boats is truly unexpected. Soldiers greatly enjoy eating this fish as sashimi.</p>
<p>In addition, design teams are laboring hard in various war zones, engaged in the construction of airfields, roads, bridges, and the design of base facilities such as barracks. People often associate war with destruction, but conversely, many modern facilities are being actively constructed in formerly uninhabited areas. War can truly be called a great construction of culture.</p>
<p>Spirit of Naval Aviation</p>
<p>In this area, naval aviation units are engaged in fierce battles day and night, filled with a vigorous fighting spirit, never forgetting their mission to destroy enemy aircraft. Even during breaks from combat, they are constantly on alert and reconnaissance, and they continue rigorous training. What I felt during my stay at the 〇〇 base was that the aircrew directly participating in combat are also extremely hardworking. On the eve of tomorrow's departure for battle, comrades shed tears of sympathy for those about to engage in combat. Bathing and other matters are conducted with orderly hierarchy. To avoid disturbing sleep, voices are kept very low. When passing in front of their sleeping quarters, one walks on tiptoe to avoid making even the slightest sound. When the aircraft return safely, everyone embraces in joy.</p>
<p>On one bombing mission, the fuel tank of a night fighter was pierced by enemy fire, leading to a heroic self-detonation. When a wingman was hit by enemy fire and descended from the sky, its speed reduced, the comrade flew alongside to protect it, waving to signal. The other pilot waved back, looking determined. Unable to save himself, he had no choice but to self-detonate. Another pilot, witnessing this, couldn't help but shed tears. Also, when the bombing concluded and they retreated from enemy airspace, the escorting fighter aircraft approached, and they said to each other, "That was great!" "Thank you!" Waving to celebrate each other's safety and valiant fight. That momentary posture was truly admirable.</p>
<p>After landing, after all reports are completed, they always offer a silent prayer of reverence towards their homeland. Ground crew members like mechanics cannot help but shed tears. Standing in a corner of the airfield in the fading twilight, they gaze intently towards the sky, waiting for the return of their beloved aircraft. Seeing that tragic posture, one can only be deeply moved.</p>
<p>Small Transport Ships</p>
<p>The crews of small naval vessels such as minesweepers, destroyers, and small transport ships that transport troops and supplies also endure considerable hardship. Minesweepers and destroyers naturally participate in combat, needless to say. Even when not in combat, they are constantly engaged in minesweeping, vigilance, patrols, and various escort duties for transport ships. Even when the South Sea is calm, there are still violent waves. The ships are very small, so they rock violently. Unable to cook, they often subsist on crackers and water for several days, which is not enough to eat. Fresh water also becomes a precious commodity; each morning, only one beer bottle of water, barely more than a liter, is distributed, which must last through the day. It is also rare to be able to take a bath.</p>
<p>The crews of small transport ships are quite worried because they are not equipped with heavy armament. When they are loaded with troops and supplies, the burden is very heavy, and at night everyone is very anxious.</p>
<p>Marines</p>
<p>Think of the valiant marines in the Wuhan campaign... Especially at this stage, although there are no reports of where the marines are active, their secret missions have not ceased. The current mission of the marines is different from that on the mainland. They are responsible for maintaining security, air defense, and other tasks at various bases. In certain locations, they penetrate deep into the forest, clearing thick undergrowth to deploy troops to take charge of maritime and aerial defense. A certain sergeant Huang said: "Vigilance in the forest and along the coast is extremely important. We tread paths without trails, through mud and wetlands, to perform our duties. The hardship is definitely beyond the imagination of those who do not know." (Excerpt from the Western Asahi Newspaper, June 10)</p>

Yesterday (17th) at three o'clock in the afternoon, the Preparatory Committee hosted members of the press from this city. Mr. Manabe, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, Mr. Nishino, Honorary Secretary of the Japan Amateur Athletic Association, Mr. Ogawa of Mantetsu, and others, entrusted by the Preparatory Committee, reported on the progress of preparations and the impressive training of the Shanghai and Dalian athletes.</p>
<p>Speech by Mr. Manabe</p>
<p>First, Mr. Manabe, Secretary, delivered a speech, stating briefly: The Shanghai-Dalian Intercity Athletic Competition will proceed as scheduled. He hoped that everyone would cooperate in publicity. Intercity competitions are still in their early stages. Although Shanghai has had several large competitions in the past, the nature of this intercity competition is very different. He sincerely hoped that everyone would exert all their efforts to assist the conference in publicity, so as to benefit the progress of the conference. Further details of the athletic competition will be described by Mr. Nishino and Mr. Ogawa. In terms of reporting, Japanese newspapers and the Domei News Agency will make their best efforts. It is anticipated that this grand occasion will not only be known throughout the city, but will also extend to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and any other places.</p>
<p>Track and Field Situation</p>
<p>Mr. Nishino then reported on the track and field situation and predictions. Among the track and field athletes in this city, the Chinese, Japanese, and German athletes are more numerous. Italians are more numerous in football, but have not participated in track and field. Dalian is represented by a cooperative team of Japanese and Manchurian athletes, totaling fifteen, who arrived in Shanghai on the 14th and began training the following day. There are a total of twenty-seven participants on the Shanghai side. The order of the events is: (1) 1500-meter race, (2) pole vault, (3) 100-meter, (4) shot put, (5) long jump, (6) 400-meter, (7) discus, (8) high jump, (9) 5000-meter long distance, (10) javelin, (11) 400-meter relay race, etc. For scoring, the top three finishers are taken into account for the 1500-meter and 5000-meter races, the top two for the relay race, with the champion earning four points and the runner-up one point. For all other track and field events, the top four finishers are taken into account, with the first place earning four points, second place three points, third place two points, and fourth place one point.</p>
<p>Track Race Prediction</p>
<p>He then discussed predictions for the competition between the Dalian team and Shanghai athletes. (100-meter) The Dalian team boasts Fukuda (with a record of 10 seconds), Japan's Sugita Hirose (both 11.4 seconds), and others, while the most promising for the Shanghai team is Mr. Kimura Takashi. Fukuda and Kimura are expected to be the most likely to win. (400-meter) The Dalian team has Japan (with a record of 55 seconds), Seguchi (53 seconds), Endo (56 seconds), etc. The Shanghai team has Ivanov and Kubota, both with records of 53 seconds. In recent training, Kubota's competition and Seguchi's relentless running from beginning to end, and Ivanov's strong stamina, make it likely that the three will vigorously contend for the lead. (1500-meter) Dalian's Seguchi, Tada (with a record of 4 minutes 30 seconds), Yu, and Tominaga are expected to be contenders, with Seguchi most likely to win the championship, followed by Tada and Tominaga. (5000-meter) The competition between Dalian's Tominaga, , Seguchi (score of 16 minutes), and Shanghai's Wang Zhenglin and Abe will be fierce, as Abe's recent performance and spirit have improved, and his results have progressed rapidly. (400-meter relay) Fukuda, Tsuchimochi, Hirose, Matsuda, Tatto, Japan, and Kato, with Fukuda, Hirose, Matsuda, and Kato having the greatest confidence, making prediction difficult.</p>
<p>Field Event Prediction</p>
<p>Later, he described the field event predictions. (1) In the long jump, Fukuda still holds the record of 7 meters, while Kimura Takashi's score is 6.96 meters, with little difference between them, the competition should be even more intense. (2) In the high jump, Kimura Takashi has a confident expectation with a score of 1.90 meters, but Fukuda is also not inferior, and it is predicted that the two will compete for the lead. (2) In the pole vault, Dalian's Abe and Kido are the most confident, and Shanghai is unlikely to have any hope. (4) In the discus, Fukuda, Kido, and Kato are all between 32 and 35 meters, while Shanghai's athletes Palocco, Hua Liechai, and Yamamoto are also between 33 and 34.5 meters, making it difficult to predict who will win. (5) The shot put will be won by Dalian, with scores between 21 and 12 meters. (6) Although Kido, Kato, and Fukuda hold records of over 50 meters in the javelin, Shanghai's Tian Xuewu has a score of 53 meters and has shown considerable improvement in recent training. This track and field competition will be conducted in a solemn and orderly manner, making the event solemn and grand.</p>
<p>Football Situation</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Ogawa reported on the preparations for football. He first stated that the inclusion of the football competition in this conference is of great significance, and football is especially of interest to the general Chinese population in the city. Therefore, football is a team sport, and both Shanghai and Dalian have formed strong teams to compete. Regarding the formation of the Shanghai team, preliminary selections were held on the 15th, dividing into red and white teams, with athletes selected from China, Japan, and Italy to compete. After the selection committee screened the outstanding players, the team was established. The list has been announced, but overall, the Shanghai team is the strongest, with Chinese players such as Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, and Li Tiansheng, and the Italian navy has increased its strength, with five players selected. The Dalian team, in terms of overall strength, is also not weak, with a balanced development of individual strengths. Although Shanghai's players have their own strengths and skills, the Dalian team has a strong belief in winning, and if the Shanghai team is negligent, they may find it difficult to win.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e34">Allocating Public Agricultural Tools <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>In order to revitalize agriculture and forestry and increase agricultural production, the Ministry of Industry has purchased public agricultural tools and allocated them to various agricultural improvement areas, allowing local farmers to apply for rentals. This measure is sufficient to bring out the following meanings: (1) The Chinese farmers' diligence, hardiness, and agricultural techniques—at least in terms of manual skills—can surpass those of any other ethnicity. However, the economic situation of Chinese farmers does not allow them to own all kinds of necessary agricultural tools. This is the biggest shortcoming of the Chinese countryside, which needs to be compensated by us. (2) "If one wishes to do good work, one must first sharpen one's tools." In the Chinese countryside, even those who own agricultural tools often have old and broken tools, which they勉强apply, impacting manpower and time in agricultural affairs, which cannot be calculated. Now, with the government's resources, purchasing brand-new public agricultural tools, and even stipulating that farmers must return them in complete and undamaged condition, and must be responsible for repairs if there is damage. Therefore, there is no doubt that the working efficiency produced by public agricultural tools will far surpass that of privately owned agricultural tools. (3) The rental price for farmers to rent public agricultural tools is only based on maintaining repair costs. In this way, farmers spend limited amounts and gain a lot. Those who have always been diligent and hardworking will feel particularly excited and work even harder. Even those who are lazy by nature and do not engage in production, seeing the agricultural tools in front of them, will feel a surge of interest in farming; invisibly, it will naturally promote agricultural activities and increase agricultural production. (4) Originally, the direct purpose of agricultural loans was to maintain the daily lives of farmers, but its indirect purpose, that is, the ultimate purpose, is to increase agricultural production. Farmers who rent agricultural tools must pay rental prices, so those who cannot afford to pay can rely on agricultural loans, so they do not have a feeling of望洋興嘆.</p>
<p>In addition, since farmers can rent public agricultural tools, it is thought that the same principle can also be applied to small-scale industries, in order to increase industrial production. When it comes to today's production issues, agriculture and industry are equally important. The industrial authorities can purchase public agricultural tools and allocate them to agricultural improvement areas, and they can also purchase public tools and allocate them to small-scale industrial areas, because the facts tell us that many small-scale factories cannot fully发挥their production capacity because of incomplete equipment and insufficient machinery. Those who talk about industrial national funds today may study this issue; at the same time, it is hoped that the industrial authorities will give it overall consideration, in order to increase wartime multifaceted production power.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Silver and Money Industries Form Syndicates to Handle Investment in Production Enterprises <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Since the National Government implemented the wartime economic policy guidelines, the National Commercial Control Council, which secures material control institutions, and the various industry trade associations under its subordinate agencies, and the various major commodity trade associations, have been established and adjusted, and are about to告二段落.</p>

The silver and money industries in this city are also forming syndicates to handle investment in production enterprises. The ones currently in progress include: (1) China and other twenty-one banks jointly formed the China Silk Industry Company Lending Syndicate, lending 50 million yuan, for the company to purchase spring and summer cocoons. (2) The Financial Promotion Association, together with more than forty banks, organized a lending syndicate to handle lending related to production enterprises, hosted by the Shanghai Industrial Bank. (3) The Shanghai Fuhe Exchange Bank, together with twelve同業, organized a lending group to handle industrial and commercial lending. (4) Regarding the purchase of wheat loans, the Yantian Grain Storage and the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Commercial Control Council have agreed to designate the China and Bank of Communications to lend 100,000,000 yuan for wheat loans, in the form of commercial acceptance drafts.</p>

<p>In order to调剂interbank finance and stabilize the market, the Central Reserve Bank, in accordance with the revised Central Reserve Bank Law, handles rediscounting of commercial drafts, bank drafts, etc., stipulating: (2) Rediscounting of domestic bank acceptance drafts, commercial drafts, and promissory notes. The aforementioned negotiable instruments must have arisen for the production, manufacturing, transportation, or sale of goods, and their due date must not exceed six months from the date of acquisition by the Central Reserve Bank. (2) Rediscounting of treasury bills and public debt interest coupons issued or guaranteed by the National Government. The due date of the aforementioned securities and interest coupons must not exceed six months from the date of rediscounting. (3) Real sales of foreign payment drafts. The due date of the aforementioned drafts, if arising from import and export trade, must not exceed four months after sight. All drafts that determine payment dates in accordance with commercial custom should have at least two signatures of reputable商號, but if accompanied by bills of lading, warehouse receipts, or warehouse warrants as担保品, and the value of the goods exceeds 25% of the amount of the negotiable instruments担保ed, one signature of a reputable商號may also be handled. The bank's loans, rediscounts, or other advances and purchases of drafts, checks, or other negotiable instruments to private individuals or companies or other individuals may not exceed 500,000 yuan per household in total. If it is a limited liability company, it may not exceed one-third of the company's capital and accumulated funds.</p>
