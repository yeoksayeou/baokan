<p>社評</p>
<h3>社會福利事業與冬賑</h3>
<p>社會福利事業，範圍至廣，如辦理得當，其效用不僅幫助社會安寗，抑且促進社會繁榮。近代國家對於社會政策，極為重視，計劃推進，不遺餘力，良非無因。政府特設專部，統籌進行，其重視社會福利事業，也可想見。</p>
<p>國家舉辦社會福利專業，應有整個方案與詳細計劃，而執行方案時，需要充分經費，尤其關於慈善救濟事業，經費數量旣極浩繁，又為消費性的經常支出，當然非國家財政所能單獨負担，須向社會各界籌募。至於私人或團體舉辦社會福利事業，偏於慈善救濟性質者，需用經費，或有的款作為基金動用，或臨時向外幕捐，論其旨趣，雖同屬社會福利範圍，但大率獨善共事，鮮與整個社會福利事業發生聯擊。就整個社會立塲，自應矯正。總之，單位事業在整個事業中，分工合作集中力量則可，而各自為政分散力量則不可。</p>
<p>於此，我們巳經知道社會福利業的重要性，而辦理成功，尤賴於經費之籌募與事業之聯擊。換言之，經費的統一籌募，事業的統一管理。以統一力量，推動整個事業，庶於社會福利有所貢獻，有所成就。</p>
<p>最近社會福利部懝訂各省市縣社會福利經費統一籌募要綱，已由行政院公布施行。至於私辦社會福利事業，亦經社會福利部訂定勸募規則，據昨日報載，已由該部呈請行政院核定，不日公布施行。是則今後對於經費的統一籌募，不論公私事業，均已有法令上的根據。我們希望經費統一籌募以後，對於事業的統一管理，不久之將來，在愼重計劃之下，也可以逐漸實現。</p>
<p>此外，報載中央與本市社會福利經費籌慕委員會業巳成立，委員人選經社會福利部與上海市政府審愼商定，並於昨日下午舉行中央暨上海市社會福利經費籌募委員會第一次聯席會議。討論議案中重要者有本市三十二年度冬賑經費籌募一案，我們會於上月二十一日社評，即已提出「準備冬賑」問題，特別主張第一，重視時間性，宜於從容準備，不宜於匆見促成事；第二，重視綜合力量，政府機關與社會團體之間，各團體彼此之間，都須取得聯絡一致，以收綜合力量的效率。我們鑒於去年度本市舉辦冬賑，失之過遲，事實上已屆春賑之期。現在旣經決定舉辦冬賑，就須迅速從事。籌慕經費，旣經規定專設委員會統一負責，就須迅速實行。立即開始計劃籌募方式與辦法，自本月十六日開始至本年年底結束，歷時一個半月，如能積極進行，不算匆促。其次，冬賑的內容，我們前已略貢管見，此際值得重複提出的，　積極性的扶導事業，應較消極性的救濟事業為側重，積極性的如小本貸金使之謀生，流浪兒童之收容敎養，酌辦輕手工業使失業者做工等等。　各施賑團體之間取得聯擊，提高賑務效率，减少取巧弊實。</p>
<p>社會福利事業，由政府領導，民間協力，論理共前途應有圓滿的成績。這次本市的冬賑，却是官民合作最好的試騐，其協力如何，可以決定成績如何，願拭目俟之</p>
<h3>昨為日本明治節　日皇親臨拜祭　東條首相相等晉宮祝賀</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電本日為日本明治節祭，皇宮中特嚴肅舉行祭典，日天皇陛下親臨拜祭，秩父宮如殿下及各皇族，上午十一時並晋宮拜謁日皇及皇后慶賀。又東條首相以次文武百官等，亦相繼晋宮，留帖祝賀。又明治神宮於是日上午八時，在安藤內相，島田海相，本山總參謀長等參列下，執行例祭，繼於十一時執行明治節祭。又日本全國國民，並於上午九時，一齊遙拜明治神宮，緬懷明治天皇之偉繢。</p>
<h3>襲波根維爾島　美空軍重創　三個半月擊落五百架</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日軍自可倫班加拉島撤退後，所羅門方面之美軍攻勢，巳集中于波根維爾島及新不列顚島，日來動員大批飛機，連續出動，企圖予日軍前綫基地以重創，日海軍機隊及陸海軍陸上部隊，對敵軍此種反攻，則布置嚴陣以待，敵軍不動則已，動則予以重創。綜合日大本營所發表者，及前綫基地　來之戰果數字，敵軍于倫特巴島登睦後，七月十七日自　波根維爾島以來，至十月未之三個半月間，來襲該島之敵機，共計達三千五百八十九架，其中被擊落者達五百零四架，擊落比率為百分之十四强。平均轟炸機，戰門機每架以五人計，則僅波根維爾島一地，敵航空員之損失即不下二千五百二十名，此外再加以所羅門全城，及新幾內亞之敵軍損失，其飛機之損失姑置不論，而數千航空員之損失實非小，又徵諸敵方航空員之缺乏，其受創之重，當可想像</p>
<p>奧村兵曹等談空戰經過</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　據南太平洋某基地電，所羅門羣島方面戰况之熾烈，已達極點，波根維爾島布英方面之日本海軍機隊，九月十四日，曾迎擊來襲之敵機三百四十架以上，與地上砲火，共同擊落其六十架，日機亦犧牲五架。是日空戰之日機，以戰門機隊之奧村兵曹最為沽躍，一日間非擊落敵機十架，內有大型機一架，戰鬥機九架，某艦隊司令長官，特授與其　有「武功拔萃「之白鞘軍刀一柄。記者為明瞭是日　敵實情，特往訪　村兵曹等建殊動之空戰勇士，羣詳述當日空戰之　　吹：是　六時半，接敵機來侵之消息，戰鬥機若干架，即昇空哨戒，三十五分鐘後，遙見敵機大編隊，自倫特巴島方面飛來，我等送準備迎擊，是日</p>
<p>天氣晴朗</p>
<p>為絕好之空戰日，瞬間，敵機飛至，我等即與敵統一式　　四型機十一架及職鬥機三十架，展開壯烈之空戰。奧村上等兵曹，首先擊落敵機西哥斯基型一架繼我等陸續擊落敵戰門機七架，於是敵戰門機全部被驅散，僅餘大型轟炸機，日機曾國攻敵大型機一架奧村兵曹又首先射中該機，以最大速度追擊，三十分鐘後，敵機中十餘彈冒火焰墜落。又是日八時，敵機又飛至機塲上空投彈，日機若干架，亦於是時起飛然已稍遲，敵統一式機十二架，戰門機三十架，已向遠處逃去，迄八時四十分，因敵機已逃走無踪，日機將欲着陸，但地上之信號告以「暫緩着陸」，又於</p>
<p>空中等待</p>
<p>然敵機終未來，復欲着陸時，信號仍呼暫待，瞬間，果然敵培爾式與巨人式飛機共四十架，自六千米高空飛來，但培爾式及互人式敵機，均非日機對手，鏖戰三十分鐘，擊落敵機半數以上，計二十二架，共中為奧村兵曹擊落者，計培爾式敵機兩架，巨人式敵機一架。共後，日機若干架因缺乏燃料，於某基地着陸，奧村兵曹及另外一架，則歸還布英，稍事休息，由整備員補給燃料彈藥。正欲補給酸案時，敵機復來力再駕機出陣，陸上之整備員，憂慮無酸素，乃高呼「勿飛至若干千米以上」，即我機若干架騰空待機，果發現敵艦上轟炸機及戰門機大批飛來，前者計五十架，後者計六十架，此時我方士氣愈形昂揚乃不顧一切，突入</p>
<p>數倍之敵</p>
<p>機羣中，敵機相繼被擊落，空戰三十分鐘後，共擊落敵艦上轟炸機五架，戰鬥機二十架，其中被奧村兵習擊落者，計艦上轟炸機一架，巨人式敵機四架。按奧村兵曹於大東亞戰爭勃發後，迄今擊落敵機五十架，現已創擊落敵機五十四架之記錄矣。又某司令談，於長期間中擊落敵機並不新奇，而一日擊落敵機十架之記錄，尙不多見，奧村兵曹之攻擊精神，與强健之體力，實令人敬佩。</p>
<h3>中日締盟後　渝方極衝動　民衆一致渴望和平</h3>
<p>廣州三日中央社電此次中日締結同盟條約，似予渝方以莫大衝動，故重慶當局仍堅持緘默態度，直至今日並未作任何表示，按今之重慶，無論在政治上軍事上經濟上社曾上均已陷於泥足難拔之地位，徒盼世界戰局與國際情勢之推移，依存外力苟延殘喘前此渝國民黨十一中全會之結果，最足以證明其所處情勢之惡劣。但重慶目下尙未有任何積極之施策，打開物價昂騰惡性通貨膨　之難局，冠以蔣介石就任主席之欺瞞政策，與所謂戰後建設等甘辭，欺騙民衆，同時渝十一中全會議決雖決定在戰後一年內實施憲政，但對其四北建設及物價對策之實施、，已不復重提，此足證重慶玫治上之不良。其在軍事方面，戰力日見疲憊，渝方雖極欲奪同緬甸，俾決定重慶存亡之路，但因日軍此次在雲南省怒江作戰，頓受打擊，其與英美軍之聯絡終告切斷，渝方現已處於外援杜絕之逼迫情勢下，其無力打開此項難局，亦為其自身所承認，僅謀賴外力以苟延時日而已。此種脆弱性已使支持抗戰之有力階級發生極大動搖，民心亦因抗戰前途之渺茫而不堪疲憊，無不翹盼和平。最近祇達魯南和平地區之渝方某一官吏稱，渝方民心多在翹望和平之到來，渝方知識階級之抗戰理論，已因日本對華新政策之具體化而告動搖，中國西南中心地桂林也充滿和平熱望　而此次締結之中日盟約，其影鄉於重慶者尤深。此次如汪主席之痛資重慶抗戰，即知其抗戰非為中國，而係為英美，使祖國陷於衰亡深淵，勢必引起民衆之强烈反對。</p>
<h3>仰光上空英機被擊落</h3>
<p>緬甸日日某基地三日中央社電　英空軍二日下午一時，以誇稱快速之新銳偵察機「蚊」號，侵入仰光上空，即經日新銳戰門機　迎擊，乃將其擊落，按英國該種偵察機　初時本預定製為輕轟炸機，以之轟炸德國，但未獲何等效果，乃行變更計劃，製為雙發木製偵察機，七月間始出現於印緬國境上空，此英方將稱之偵察機，至日新銳戰鬥機前，亦無能為力矣。</p>
<h3>檳榔嶼華僑　獻購機捐款　日醫學博士會亦獻金</h3>
<p>擯榔嶼三日中央社電此間華僑協會，前曾準備獻納戰門機製造資金，茲已募得欵項三十萬元，特於三日明治節祝賀典禮完畢後，由華僑協會會長連裕祥，向伊丹州長官呈獻。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日本醫學博士會發起獻呈政府之軍用機醫　號，茲已得日本全國各醫學博士贊助　金，以十二萬　獻納陸海軍兩省。又此軍用機獻呈　式，已於三日下午二　社　　可　你</p>
<h3>渝方對英美　深感不滿</h3>
<p>廣州三日中央</p>
<p>社電　渝方對於英美之無誠意援渝，深表不滿，渝方之機關報中央日報，頃發表一文，痛羅英國之冷淡態度，其大意如次：自美國參院議員於視察戰綫歸國後，曾發表稱，英國之援助渝方，尙未作充分努力，我人對此，極抱同感，我人除攻擊英國之無責任態度外，同時希望英國對此有表示。又英國將美國貸奧之軍器，上加英國　　，送往他國，企圖於戰後獲得有利地位，我人對於此種行為，極感不快。</p>
<h3>各地熱烈慶祝　中日締結盟約</h3>
<p>蘇州</p>
<p>蘇州三日中央社電江蘇省會各界聯合會為擁護中日同盟，於四日上午十時在公共體育塲召開民衆大會，關於大會秩序及遊行路綫與參加單位順序，昨已分別決定。又蘇省王財廳長於三日午後六時四十分在蘇州廣播電　廣播，講演中日締結盟約之眞諦。</p>
<p>杭州</p>
<p>杭州三日中央社電杭市府為慶祝中日同盟條約，促使一般市民對中日同盟之眞諦瞭解了見，日昨特派員分赴市區各通衢大街及公共塲所，舉行擴大宣傳，期使市民深切認識正義和平，及中日友好關係之意義。</p>
<p>鎭江</p>
<p>鎭江三日中央社電鎭江各界為慶祝中日同盟條約，特於今三日上午十時舉行遊行大會，鎭各機關團體亦均參加，悄緒　為熱烈。</p>
<p>蘇淮</p>
<p>中央社蘇淮通凱　中日簽訂同盟條約，全國民衆莫不歡欣鼓舞。蘇淮特別區所屬二十一市縣，即將展開擴大慶祝，以示擁護之熱意。記者為　詢郝行政長官對於中日同盟之感想，特趨前訪矚，承發表談話，大意如次：中日兩國旣已　同甘共苦同生共死的至高精神，則兩國同盟為常然之舉，日本以道義為基礎，以平等待我國，我國自當與之聯合共向革命理想之途邁進，以實現國父遺志，此次簽同盟條約，實為中日關係發展的歸結云云。</p>
<h3>爪哇中參院　開首次會議</h3>
<p>社電　爪哇中央參議院第一次會議，已在此問中央會議堂舉行，會議期間共五日，此實為爪哇歷史上最光榮之一頁。當地日軍最高指揮官對該中央參議院之期望，在使原地住民協力大東亞戰爭。又當　為確立戰時態勢，關於種種施策，曾向原地住民護員聽取關於爪哇風俗習慣宗教等具體意見，原住民議員在此五日間之審議期問，已決定申答案，呈遞日軍最高指揮官，內容如次：　確立强化防肅義勇軍組織，　設立勞動機關，以提供大量之勞動力。　强化原住民之戰時生產態勞，　增强戰時物資之生產。</p>

<h3>蘇軍攻克里米亞遭德軍堅强抵抗　寇許半島登陸部隊被圍殲</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電德元首行營二日公佈東綫戰况如次：　德軍在克里伏洛格北方發動反攻，大獲成功，並阻止蘇軍在克里米亞之登陸企圖。　蘇軍於東綫企圖在寇許半島兩側登陸，德軍在一地點圍殲蘇軍，並壓迫蘇軍至狹小地區，德軍更在其他登陸地點重創蘇軍。　德軍在聶伯河下游南部諾喬草原與進攻之蘇軍機械化部隊繼續戰鬥中。</p>
<p>柏林三日中央社電德國新聞社訊：東綫秋季大戰之中心，目下在於克里曼卓格之南，該處雙方以大隊坦克車與砲兵從事於消耗戰，結果如何尚不可逆睹。蓋雙方均已調到增援之生力軍，該區之戰事以及克里伏洛格以北。諾蓋草原　與寇許海峽等處之戰事，均當視為目下正在進行中之大戰一部份。蘇軍由北面封鎖克里米亞半島，並由東面加以進攻，希望使該半島處於孤立之地位，但德軍顯然已預料此種發展。蓋因企圖在寇許半島兩勞登陸之蘇軍强大部隊尚未抵達海岸之前，幾乎已完全被殲滅，蘇軍則面保護之部隊未能建立一岸頭堡，因此結果蘇軍僅在一處據點完成其登陸之舉，預料蘇軍今後將續有登陸之企圖，故半島之東岸似已由德軍加以堅强之保護。克里米亞以北之局勢，對於蘇軍亦不計樂觀，德軍司令部並不間有撇退克里米亞之理由，關於此點，蘇方所稱克服貝利谷浦（Perekop）一節，並未經德軍證實，或許少數漫散之蘇坦克車在附近平坦無樹之地域上行動，亦未可知。但設有此事，則此等坦克車亦必在貝利谷浦地峽遭遇穗軍堅强之隙碍。敵摩托部隊主力繼續以聶怕河下游爲目標，此則引起一種局勞內有不少令人耐味之可能。</p>
<h3>聶伯河西岸德不斷反攻</h3>
<p>但穗國軍界人士對於此點，繼續保守緘默，如同對於德軍在克里伏洛格以北之勝利一樣。但星期二日穗軍戰報巾所含之數字巳有綫索可尋其更堪注憲者，乃德軍在克里伏洛格以北之損失，實際甚爲輕微，該區戰事雖歷多日，但德軍司令部並無重整其部隊之必要。</p>
<p>柏林三日中央社電德國新聞社訉：星期一日聶伯河彎曲處戰事之重心，仍在克里伏洛格之北，該處德軍衡錄隊殲減四散之蘇軍分隊，事前此等蘇軍分隊與其主力之聯絡已被切斷，而匿於深谷中。據現有之悄息，在此戰事行動中，蘇坦克軍被毀二十一輛，共中包括最重型者三輛，同時德軍坦克車之尖劈，織續向前猛攻，並獲得土地上更多之進展。扎克薩干河與英古勒士河間之摕蕩戰，仍繼續中，僅在該區一處，蘇軍戰死者約有一萬二千名，於此可見該處近一星期以來戰事之劇烈，與蘇軍損失之重大，德軍擒獲紅軍戰俘五千名以上，並奪得大批坦克車與大砲，詳見星期二日之德軍戰報。蘇軍在克果伏洛格區企圖向西南與西北猛攻，以便解救其被壓迫之主力隊，但結果完全無效。</p>
<p>突內諾蓋草原拉鋸戰進行中</p>
<p>柏林三日中央社電海通社訊：德軍在大聶伯河套之反攻，仍在逐漸進行中，德軍生力軍源源開到前綫，故德軍之通攻力將續有增加。突入諾蓋草原之蘇軍亦未有多大之進展，德軍在該草原之邊建立陣地，以阻敵軍進入克里米亞與渡越爺伯河下游，該處陣地於星期一雖遭最嚴重之壓力但尚未至崩漬之地步。在該草原之本部，則穗蘇兩軍之流動部隊正在進行拉距戰在戰事之過程中，蘇軍繼續向聶伯河口推進。蘇軍在寇許海峽登陸之戰事，依整個戰局而觀，不能認爲成功。星期一蘇軍在東綫自克里曼卓格至明斯克與斯摩倫斯克公路之區域内，發動局部之進攻，尤以某輔東面與戈美爾西南更爲激烈，惟敵軍汔未獲遑。</p>
<h3>東錢北路　已降小雪　南部氣候轉劣</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電德國新聞社訊：東綫南部之天氣已更轉惡劣，但軍事之活動亳未受影響。北部泥濘時期已漸漸開始，使該處之戰事行動告緩，若干處甚至已有小雪之報告。</p>
<h3>路易斯與伊克斯商煤礦罷工情形　美各地燃料已大感不足</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電據華盛頓消息，美國礦工聯合會主席路易斯，於星期二與美內長伊克斯會商煤礦罷工情形，星期二僅有一小部份礦工復工，就本雪凡尼亞一州而言，八萬礦工中僅有二萬八千人復工。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城三日中央社電據華盛頓來電，羅斯福巳於一日對東部煤礦礦工公，工人，發出停止罷工之指令，然此等礦工寬對大總統令出以桃戰態度，採取一致行動，繼續罷工，工作中之礦工，亦參加罷工，至此，已形成煤礦礦工會五十三萬工人之總罷工，除一部勞動總同盟系之工人，繼續工作外，美東部煤礦完全停止工作。羅斯颺指定停止罷工之期限爲三日上午，罷工工人表示，若無公會本部可發停止罷　工之指令，大總統　指定復工期限，亦不停止罷工，因此公會會長路易斯之態度極堪注目。路易斯曾於二日兩次會見政府接收煤礦之責任者燃料局長伊基斯，同時，公會之政策委員會，再將其決定延期三日。此次罷工於形成總罷工前，因已有相當長時期之罷工，故自總罷工開始之第一日起，美國之燃料即深感不足，北明罕布製鐵用煤，即仰仗西拉巴馬州煤鑛之供給，現因用煤不足，镕鑛爐巳行停火，新英格關地方及巴茲堡等全美各主要都市，傳一般民用煤不足，例如紐約民用之眝藏量，僅可供今後二三日之用。據煤礦主方面觀測，縱礦工依羅斯福之指令，於三日上午復工，各煤礦至少亦需待一星期後，始能恢復罷工前之狀態。燃料局長伊基斯於二日對刻正運輪中之煤二百萬噸，發出凍結令，並決白十日起對貯殲煤業者停让配給，加强一般民用煤配之限制，以防萬一事態。</p>
<h3>美官方否認凍結阿資金</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電德國新聞社載紐約訊，官方宣稱：美國並無封鎖阿國銀行之資金之事。按昨傳美財部凍結在華盛頓兩阿根廷銀行之資產。</p>
<h3>國府推進决戰經濟　陳實業部長對日記者談話</h3>
<p>國民政府的經濟政策，由於强制收買棉紗布及米穀而逐漸定上眞正的戰時經濟的大道，前次國府部長級人物調動時，汪主席更毅然更迭經濟施策的當局者實業部長，這說明了國府遂行戰時經濟施策的決意，因此，新實業部長陳君慧氏所懷的抱負如何，在今後國府的經濟施策之動向上，極爲重要。每日新聞社記者宮森氏，曾會見新部長，關於目前的經濟情形及今後的施策，獲聞其所懷的抱負。</p>
<p>問回府的戰時經濟施策，因强制收買棉紗布而跨上了眞正的第一步，請問高見對於經濟界的實情如伺？</p>
<p>答戰時經濟綢領決定於本年之初，此中顯示了戰時經濟政策的金貌，問題在於其如何實現。今後爲促進戰時經濟政策起見，第一，注憲於靈心，完成必需品生產的增加及物資供求的調整。第二，强化民間經濟機構，使適應戰時經濟體制，官民協力，以完遂戰時經濟政策之强力的推進。第三，政府的關係當局，從計劉到買行，從中央到地方，强化縱橫二方面各機構的內容，更加緊各機關相互間的關係，以便取一致步調，向共同目標推進政策。</p>
<p>問全國商業統制總會爲國府遂行戰時經濟政策的中樞機關，如何加以活用，似爲國府經濟政策成否的關鍵，其改善方策如何？</p>
<p>答爲運用商統會，且使與國民政府之間發生密切的關係起見，必須實行下列三點：</p>
<p>第一，在政府指導之下，使商統會發揮民間之自動的統制精神及動態的力量，並使從事物資的收買配給，生產的增加，以貫澈戰時經濟政策。第二，政府對商統會典以實質的援助，同時，商統會也應對政府盡最大的努力，如此，戰時經濟政策的完遂可期，而官民協力的實際亦可以實現。第三，政府正在推進戰時經濟政策的遂行，積極實施行政機構的强化。今後的改革，自當以事實的必要而一一實施。唯政策的統一，步調的整頓，意向的一致這三點，是不可缺的條件。細問警如拿强制收買棉紗布一事來說，這强權的統制精神，如何有助於民生的改善，似有具體的努力表示於民衆之必要。</p>
<p>答民衆對統制經濟能夠理解，是最重要的一件事，必須使民衆完全理解政策，並由於實行拿事實來使之理解。所以今後　還要表現事實，並積極的推進宜傳，啟漿。在宣傳工作方面，使理解大東亞戰爭，抑制戰時下的個人利益。</p>
<p>問繼棉紗布之後，統制商品種類的擴充，並地域的擴大之途徑如何？</p>
<p>答要推進戰時經濟政策，不能不強化統制經濟，因此，第一實行重心主義，以此為中心而施行統制。第二，目前在中國實施全而統制的條件尚未十分具備，所以希望積極的進行準備工作以完成諸條件。第三，不能不迅速完成戰時體制下經濟統制計劉之實施。因此，政府希望從簡單而可以實現的部分做起，盡最大的力量，實施强力的統制</p>
<p>問中國民族資本的實情如何？又對於恢復產業並中日分工合作的理想如何？</p>
<p>答這裏有二個問題，一是日本方面發還工廠的活用，另一是這上面所必要的民族資本之利用問題。利用民族責本是最切要的工作，因此，必須排除阻害工廠經營的諸條件。那就是說，由於投資的合理化，以確保利潤，補充原料，燃料，促進工業農業二者間物資的交流，以謀物資之收買，配給，生產之合理的配備，尤以上海工業的發達，和內地物資的交流是最重要的前提條件。現在上海工業的復活遲遲不進。至於中日分工合作，當然，中國從事輕工業，日本從事重工業。唯目前中國的實情，所謂重工業，輕工業的區別，很多人不大明瞭。所以有些人想，在某種程度上中國所能做的重工業，又中國所可以做的重工業，不可以讓中國自己來做嗎？</p>
<p>問統制經濟是用權力以把握經濟。權力依存於信用。期獲實效，胥視有否實行統制經濟的廉潔政治。其方法如何？</p>
<p>答要促進統制經濟，廉潔政治的徹底是不可缺的條件。因此，在稍極方面，政府業巳制定處罰法令，希望今後能徹底的運·積極方面，改善公務員的待遇，强化對各機關的監督指導，希望能由此可獲廉潔政治的成果。此外，對公務員强化似新國民運動等的政治的訓練，也是必要的。</p>
<p>問國府在經濟政策的推進上，對日本的希望如何？</p>
<p>答第一，對華新政策的實施，係全中國民衆最所感激的，今後想更進一步貫　這精神。第二，排除存在於中國國內的地域經濟，是民衆所一致希望的。第三，生產的增加，乃最主要的對策，在技術上，運輛上，及其他各部面，希望在可能節圍內與以最大的援助。（翔：譯自十月二十一日東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>美工團會要求　撤銷兩法案</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城三日中央社電菲拉得爾非亞來電：美國工團會議，頃在此間舉行第六屆年會，議決要求政府即時徹銷禁止罷工法及普及低級鐵工廠工資法兩決議案，該兩案要旨如左：　撇銷禁止罷工法案，察政府對勞工公會行動之蠻擴，不啻表示民主主義及戰事前途之險惡，成立此種法案，實有害於工人之愛國心及國家之統一，政府亟應即行廢止此種惡法。　撇銷普及低級鐵工廠工資法，察國民對健全之經濟安定政策，期望甚大，但迄未實現，實屬不幸，在强力物價政策全面配給制度定當課稅未實施之際，勞工工資必須時時調整，政府亟應放棄基於普及低級鐵工廠工資法而設之安定工資方策。</p>
<h3>蘇格蘭西部　萬餘人罷工　因要求增加工資未遂</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電倫敦息：蘇格蘭西部重工業工人一萬名，因要求增加工資被拒，昨日開始罷工，其他相似工業之工人，亦以今日罷工相要脋。</p>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電據倫敦來電，英國格拉斯哥之發動機製造工廠女工及其他工人一萬名，因要求改善待遇，己自一日起開始罷工，伕工總會雖即日施以安撫工作，然仍有萬餘工人亦參加罷工。</p>
<h3>美州選舉　共和黨獲勝</h3>
<p>日內瓦三日中央社電德國新聞社訉，據來自華盛頓之報告稱：日昨美數州舉行選舉之初次結果，共和黨較民主黨獲票爲多，共和黨在紐約占上風，該州副州長已由大多數票選出共和黨黨員擔任之，紐傑賽州之州長已屢於共和黨，共和黨在菲勒特爾菲亞州亦占優勢。</p>

<h3>阿根廷表示嚴守中立</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城三日中央社電阿根廷外長吉爾勃將軍，頃與智利報駐該處訪員談稱：阿根廷不欲與世界任何一國爲敵，職是之故，阿根廷將維持完全及絕對之中立。阿根廷此種態度，並非獨一無二者，如蘇聯並未向日本宣戰，在歐洲則有瑞典瑞士西班牙葡萄牙，甚至愛爾闡均繼續確守中立，土耳共亦採取同一政策，故阿根廷資無理由不採取此同一之中立政策，且該政策完全滴　阿根廷民衆之心理，阿根廷願與任何人爲友，僅侵犯阿根廷主權及軍嚴之國家，阿根廷方與之斷絕邦交。阿根廷於處理自身半件事，足稱獨立，並無外來之壓力，現府為向所未有之堅强政府。</p>
<h3>日蘇關係　依然不變</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電、海通社訊，據倫敦交換電訉報來自莫斯科之報告稱：莫斯科悄息靈通人士力申日蘇關係，並不因莫斯科會議所決定之反軸心國合作而有所改變。</p>
<h3>莫斯科會議結果　蘇外交勝利　四國宣言數點堪注意</h3>
<p>東京三口中央社電英美蘇三國代表莫斯科會談結果，發表四國共同宣言，及英美蘇二回共同公報。其中引起注意者有以下數點：　四國共同宣言中，渝訪僅具虛名，蓋共同宣言渝駐蘇大使傅秉常雖亦掛名，然共同宣言及三國共同公報內均未涉及渝方之立塲及利益，僅以抽象且概括的決定，圖謀敷衍而已，渝方未被招請會談，乃屬當然之事，其於共同宣言中僅具形式且附屬之地位。　共同宜言及共同公報僅論及歐洲問題，毫未淕及東亞問題，此即莫斯科會談輕視渝方地位，且對東亞問題無何具體決定之明證。　如共同公報所　認者，三國會談所提出之議案中，尚有多數未獲解決，如所謂「附記各委員會」委諸今後之外交處理等是。　未明確硏究第二戰綫間題。共同公報中所謂「巳決定之軍事諸問題，」僅以蘇聯之主張爲中心，　無疑問。　關於討論英美主張之政治問題結果，應詳議之西南歐·四亞·北歐等各重點避而未談，而僅提出義德之闖題，及蘇聯認爲無關重要之奥地利問題，此亦蘇聯壓制英美之意圖，至討論政治問題中途而止。總之，莫斯科會談之結果，與事前所預想者同，爲蘇聯外交之勝利而已。換言之，即英美始終係追隨蘇聯之後，而英美所最感苦惱者，即對此次會談抱最大期待之「斯邱羅會談」問題，未得任何結果，僅以三氏之空名發表一共同宣言，僅由此觀之即可謂此次會談已半歸失敗。</p>
<p>協定效力</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電據華盛頓消息：美國務院發善人淤星期三宣稱：在莫斯科所簽訂之協定，雖未經批准，但對於各簽約國在國際上與條約有同樣效力，關於實施該協定之細則亦然。</p>
<p>德國人士評論一斑</p>
<p>柏林三日中央社電德外交當局二日就莫斯科會談之公報，表明見解如次：　莫斯科會談之公報，乃英美兩國對蘇聯制霸歐洲之降服，確認全歐屈服於共產全義勢力之下。　微諸此次公報內容，可知英美兩國之政策已全面失收。　此次之公報中未言泣與蘇聯有利害關係之飲洲各國，反提出關於奥地利問題，然奧地利已於一九三八年依人民之自由投票，　成穗國之一部，此乃世界大戰後仍爲民主主義體制施行人民投票之主張與德國合併，然英美認人民投票結果遠反凡爾賽條約，故宣言無效。大西洋憲章標榜民族自決，但不尊重該國人民意思，强要所謂「民主主義性質之自由」，實難獲得世人諒解。　該公報非難德軍及國社黨，然思及蘇軍於加多固森林殘殺大批波闌士兵之事實，此種非難實爲無恥之言辭。德國各報亦於二日分別著論批評，漢堡「加大雷姆典布拉報」戰此次之公報中，羅列種種言辭，乃一可怪之文獻，公報中未言及之點，或較其所言及者尤爲重要，且根本未談及三國代表意覓未能一致之湃案，尤其關於蘇聯之國境未作何等公約，此即英美對蘇聯屈服之明證。又德國民衆中亦謂此次之公報果如所料，乃着重神經戰方面，自軍事政治上之見地觀之，並無何等成果，此次會談結果已判明反軸心陣管中最强有力之當事者乃爲蘇聯。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞深爲關切</p>
<p>羅京三日中央社電羅馬尼亞政界人士評莫斯科會議之最後公報稱：因羅馬尼亞係蘇俄西陲接境之小國之一，故受莫斯科會議所決定之領土議案影響甚鉅。蘇陸軍機關報「紅軍報」曾謂紅軍於擊　芬蘭後，並不認為已感滿足，故羅報指出與　鄰近各國均與芬蘭同一命運。</p>
<h3>德軍在義山區　佈梯形陣綫　英美軍進展遲緩</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央記電德元首行營發表義南境戰况：美軍曾於晚間在伏爾托諾河迤西地區發動攻勢數次，約經擊退，該河之東敵軍跟踪德軍正在後撤之殿後部隊，穗重砲及飛機猛力轟炸予以重創。</p>
<p>柏林三日中央社電據海通社訊：自星期一至星期二午刻，亞特里亞海沿岸及特里諾河一帶，局勢未有變更。亞平寗山中部英第八軍左翼則又開始活動，但前進僅有數公里，至星期一猶未越卡達魯普（Cartaluho）至弗萊沙竉（Fresoione）之一綫。向伊索尼亞推進之英先鋒，被德軍砲火所阻，但主力仍推動不已。其左有美第五軍之一部，欲圓襲取米萊特山之德軍，以悄滅對伏爾托諾谷美軍側面之威脅。美軍於星期一續向維納弗洛（Venefro）進攻未有進展，美第五軍之中心現正向克羅斯山進攻，佔領狄埃諾（Teano）後未能續沿山麓進取，在狄埃諾一戰中，美軍損失重火，坦克車被毀二十一輛，蓋塔灣沿海地帶內美軍左翼　末越蒙特拉只小城後，暫停前進，但砲隊及突擊隊則加緊活動，諒屬總攻之先聲。總之，德軍藉敵方遲緩之推進，已依山佈置梯形陳地，配以新式重兵器，敵人恐難以飛渡。</p>
<h3>反軸心機隊　襲德東南部</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電日昨敵機　德之東南部，德民衆略有死傷，房屋亦受損失，敵機七架被擊落。德軍亦於昨晚襲倫敦區之軍事目標。</p>
<p>布遠　斯三日中央社電據海通社訉：匐牙利官方通訊社稱：英美飛機數隊星期二正午飛越匈牙利之西部邊界，旋向西北方面飛去，敵機後仍循原有路綫飛囘，有　　彈尚無報告。</p>
<h3>南非聯邦　選舉結果</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電南非聯邦選舉結果，政府黨及擁護政府黨　三省佔優勢，國家主義黨則在奥倫治自由邦優勢。</p>
<h3>英土兩國外長　開羅舉行會議　美駐土大使亦將參預</h3>
<p>安加拉三日中央社電英駐土大使許閣森及土外長曼里卓格營離安加拉赴開羅途中，在該處將與英外相艾登會談。</p>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電倫教無綫電今　　告：英外相艾登與土耳其外長在開羅會議時，美國駐土大使斯坦哈特亦將參加，斯氏曾在美哀逗留數星期，至上星期一始啟程返任。</p>
<h3>緬甸作戰特輯　緬甸戰塲概况</h3>
<p>蒙特巴頓召集會議</p>
<p>新任東南亞洲反軸心軍司令官蒙特巴頓，抵印就任後，立即邀集英印軍司令官歐慶萊克，印度英空軍司令官披阿斯，英印艦隊司令官薩瑪比爾，英印海軍司令官戈特弗萊，美國駐印第十航空隊司令官台維遜，以及駐渝印美軍總司令官史蒂維爾，渝外長宋子文，聯絡將校等多人，在新德里召開英美渝軍事會議，以克復緬甸爲中心，協商束亞反攻計劉，旋又邀請東南亞洲反軸心軍參謀長亭利蒲那爾，於十六日舉行「在束南亞洲戰域的作戰」會議，東南亞洲反軸心軍首腦部，顯然是在積極活動。今次反軸心軍的反攻東亞計劉，僅是根據奈貝克會談上英美的共同意見，其規模決非今春的阿拉　出擊可比，這是不難想像的，但英美渝軍究竟在如何作戰準備之下實現其反攻計釗呢？這英就來綜合敵方的情報，將其戰力及作戰計劉　况檢討一下。</p>
<p>敵方兵力估計</p>
<p>據可靠消息稱：現在敵方的在印兵力，計有英軍數十萬，重陵駐印遠征軍三師，約五萬之　，駐印美軍三萬，空軍方面，計有英國空軍飾團五個，美國空軍一師團，飛機約共一千五百架，但此全部兵力，並不完全集中於東南亞洲戰域。</p>
<p>綠陸軍部隊，約有二十萬配備於加爾各答以東的東部，其中東部軍力約十五萬，渝軍約五萬，又航空兵力亦同樣有五百餘架配置在東部方面。</p>
<p>敵力今後戰略</p>
<p>敵方憑此兵力，或許要想從北面怒江戰綫突破連接阿拉　山脈，蒙特，安達曼羣島，尼科巴爾，　巴恩，尼亞斯，門這愛一帶的日方弧統形轉勞中的那一點，但是敵方不得不分散兵力，結果或許來突破阿拉實？或在緬甸南部發動登陸作戰？也許後安遠曼，尼科巴爾或門道愛羣島來奇　蘇門答臘，實行對那一點的集中攻擊，但是阿拉貫的天險高峰，不容敵方龐大部隊的全面快速作戰，敵方的進攻路，僅不過從英泊爾直達基多英河中流的巾部阿拉貫路，以及從吉大港取道禁特，日溪南下的海岸路綫二條，况且英印軍今春「阿拉買悲劇」的創痍未復，豈敢再想從阿拉　正面來挑戰，旣然如此。那末集中於東部印緬國境的十五萬及南部印度軍，向何處求其出擊點呢？關於此事，八月二十五日的路透社電訊有這樣一段觀測，題為「東南太平洋反軸心軍作戰」，文中列舉下面三點！</p>
<p>確保孟加拉灣的制海權</p>
<p>奪囘尼科巴爾安達曼</p>
<p>在緬甸沿岸奇襲登陸</p>
<p>幷指出東南亞洲反　軍司令官已由著名奇襲登陸作戰權威蒙特巴頓氏就任的事實，强調南部印度軍有向安達曼，尼科巴爾進攻作戰的可能性，敵方廣播亦稱在加爾各答與吉大港之間擁有重兵，足以決定登陸作戰成功與否的航空戰力方面，亦己策備萬全，但關矯登陸軍接濟綫的海上輸送，笑國民族週刊，發表悲觀論調稱：</p>
<p>登陸大感困難</p>
<p>「登陸部隊的接濟，極其困難，至多在軍事上確保小地區的橋頭堡。』假使實行從錫蘭乃至印度南部發動海上大通攻，則一個師麈的進攻，假定以須要三十萬噸船隻統計，如有二十萬大軍進攻，那末至少要用五百萬噸的船隻，然而議航方面單憑印度洋艦隊是決計不夠的，勞必要目下在東地中海作戰的英義地中海艦隊來增援，要完成一切準備，至少到本年底方行，則其進攻，自非來年之初不可了，其進攻目標，假若如路透社所傳係置於安遠曼，尼科巴爾，則我們在距離上視之，可以窺測下面幾點，從　蘭到安遠曼，是一千〇八于公里，到尼科巴爾是一千一百五十公里，如以就爾各打爲基點，則到安達受爲一千一百八十公里，到尼科巴爾是一千五百七十公里。在航空戰力的基礎上，我日本方面巳確保較對方二倍以上的優勢，敵方利用航空母艦的接濟，除屬服於日本陸上飛機猛威之下，別元其他生路。（企靑　自十月什一日讀資報知）</p>
<h3>英美爭統帥權</h3>
<p>東亞洲反軸心軍總司令官蒙特巴頓氏，二星期前到遠新德里後，除任命總參謀長等人員外，並召集該方面軍事尃家，連日舉行軍事會議，且赴重慶與蔣介石會談。而其目的，袛在於宣傳的效果。二十四的柏林某報刋載一篇題爲「蒙特巴頓的作戰及其可能性」的論文，其大要如左：</p>
<p>蒙特巴頓的暗影</p>
<p>東南亞洲反（軸心軍總司令官蒙特巴頓氏，任命以來，快近二月，最近始漸到達新德里。到任後，立即召集該方面海陸空軍首腦部，連日舉行軍事會議。然而西南太平洋方面反軸心軍司令官麥克沃塞既不應召出席，亦不派遣代表，而一方面重慶亦未有代表出席。可間這邱吉爾新近任命的所謂「陸海空軍名將」蒙特巴頓的統帥範圍，並不達到全東亞反軸心軍。又反軸心軍的對日作戰上所必要的美國太平洋艦隊，向由共司令長官尼密資率領，現在當然不願意在蒙特巴頓之下。所以東亞的反軸心軍作戰，實際上由麥克沃塞，蔣介石，尼密資，蒙特巴頓四人指揮。事見克會談中煞費苦心所決定的任命蒙特巴頓爲總司令官，點果，一點也沒有實際的意義。從這裹面可以看出英美二軍之間存在着深不可越的泓溝，英美反軸心軍的對日攻勞計劃，在統　間題上殊爲混亂。</p>
<p>四處戰塲大勢</p>
<p>其次，英美軍的攻擊日本的基地有阿留申羣島中國大陸，西南太平洋，印度東部四處。這戰綫兩起熱帶、北近北極團。區域　袤，在緬旬作戰及南太平洋作戰中，其補充首先成爲問題。且阿留申羣島可以作戰的祗低有夏季的二個月，緬甸國境地帶作戰的，在雨季是不可能的，因這氣候上的限制，所以英美所希望的全綫同時開始攻勢，是絕對不可能的。英美把重慶的實力估計極高，抱着將來以此爲基地空襲日本本土的夢想。堡最近在山東省，浙江省發動反攻的渝軍，不久即被日軍擊退，由此事實足以證明今日的渝軍不能說是英美有力的同盟軍。要有效地推動渝軍，不能不從緬甸逐出臼軍，確保對重慶的補充綫。但那在今日是不可能的。</p>
<p>前述四戰綫中，今日積極活動着的，祖有麥克沃塞所指揮的西南太平洋戰綫。這巳經繼續了一年多，和奎貝克會談沒有直接的關係。麥克沃塞軍在此方面怎樣苦戰，祇要看自從去年八月在違爾加納爾島開始反攻以來，經過一年有餘，直至今日，他們所獲得的登陸地島屈指可數，就可以明白，僅在瓜島登陸戰一役中，笑軍的犧牲已達數萬，蒲那方面澳軍的損失極大，從蒙遂飛機塲到潘洛哥一點點的距離需時二十三日，薩剌莫阿的森林戰之役，費時六週，犧牲澳軍五千，這此都是事實勝於雄辯的地方，且日軍機巧地轉進，再在另一陣地遨擊敵人，所以麥克沃塞軍的戰鬥，極爲困苦。另一方面，在緬甸戰綫，懲於本年四月及五月的慘敗，不敢輕率妾動。</p>
<p>英美海軍將遭危機</p>
<p>倫敦方面以爲，緬甸戰役中有力的海軍的援助，是不可缺的。自從義大利海軍投降之後，英國地中洵艦隊得以抽調相當有力的艦隊至遠東，但尚不能獨力對付日本海軍。爲了西南太平洋作戰，美海軍常希望這英國艦隊的位置移調到遠東。從這事實中可以看出自從珍珠灣一役以來美國海軍的痛苦情形。至於日木海軍的主力，迄今依然絲亳無損，以具有世界第一的訓練，具有旺盛的戰鬥精神之臼本国民爲背景的日本海軍，其地盤穩固逾恒，亳不動搖。笑海軍長官諾克斯曾銳，如和日本開戰，三個月統可以使日本屈服。但在這二年問，諾克斯已經得了很多的敎訓了，現在甚至於銳過：英笑海軍有被日本海軍殲減的危險。諾克斯很明瞭英美的對臼攻勢，須付出意想不到的龐火的犧牲，諾克斯所抱的不安，現在在蒙特巴頓的作戰計劃上，也投下了陰影。（翔：　自十月二十八日西部期日新聞）</p>

<h3>參加赴滿考察團　北行感想</h3>
<p>— 黃頑</p>
<p>宣傳都於上月組轍中國記者赴滿考察團，召集京　　杭漢皖等地各報記奢，一行七人，　於日前分別安抵京滬·本人受本報特漲滲加，亦於日昨返滬。略誌此行感想如次：</p>
<p>北方氣候溫暖</p>
<p>「本人六年不乘火軍，此次率派赴滿觀光，帶目疾而行，率今冬北方氣候溫暖，夾在尙不覺寒。在滿只勾留半個月，歷經新京，吉林，給爾　，奉天，按山等都市，每處停留時最短的四小時，最多有四天。日親早恕排定，走馬看花，絕少個別瀏覽機會。益以眼病足病，不良於行，如果說我認驖了滿洲國，則等於說謊。但也不能推說此行亳無感想。我等到滿第個印象，就是朝野共同刻苦奮鬥的精神，具有新興國家的氣象。所到各地，承當局及文藝界新闡界熱烈數迎招待，又蒙弘報處特　事務官羅仲梁君，一路引導遠絡，得與各界推誠相與，增張。愛其　之感悄。束亞其榮之僧念，愈益普　化。</p>
<p>全國在躍進中</p>
<p>我等目覩十一年來滿洲國　通實况：　治安之確保，　內政之刷新；　史治之廉明：　教　之改善：　產業之開發；　工藝之振興。行政事務集於總務應，實踐戰時體制，統一而有效，上下一心，爲建國而努力，協和的空氣，非常濃厚，正與中國人民苦幹精神互相　　，到處領會到滿洲國人的勸勞興國令人驚傳。滿洲國自行　　給辨法，生活必需晶由政府公平既給，物價絕無黑布。一致希絮國內的生產，足數體全國民的消耗，因爲糧食不足，民食有一定限制。公務員都吃大麥　米，飯館亦規定時間，中午不買酒，四　只有一片麵包，和榮只一碗粗飯，吃完不得再添。一般人都　協和服，掛上錦帶，也就算禮服。女子亦多短服雅淡樸素，無燙髮高跟鞋等奢糜現象。穿奢侈的服裝，反遭蔑視。</p>
<p>物價一斑</p>
<p>在配給制度下，貧富受同樣的數目，米小孩四公斤，十一至二于五歲九公斤，二十六至四十歲八公斤，四十至六十歲七公斤，配給價格是相當的低廉，以滿票計，高梁一斤九分，一等粉一袋十一元六角，鹽一斤一角五分，糖一斤四角，火柴一大包六角，鶴　每只一角八分，牛度用馬皮猪皮代　，　毛用麻，咖啡牛　均用代替品，旅館水電燃料，均節約，洗滌五時開始，有家眷不許久屠，白天用馬車代人力車，加上公共汽車和電車，晚上只好步行。</p>
<p>現代都市的新京</p>
<p>滿洲國人口總數，現有四千三百萬，漢滿佔最多數。文字言語，風俗習慣，全係中國化。採用王道政治，尊崇聖教，發揚東方固有之文明。各省設立王逍書院，培養建國人才。在新京遍游全市，經十一年之建設，今已長成爲現代之都市，種種設施，足資吾國借錢者甚多。無奈爲時迫切，所見又都個於東滿一帶。幸承各昇惠贈寫眞及參考資料，他日有暇當冉分別作記，以餉國人。</p>

<p>本市經香切麵之商號，約達一千家以上，晚近國無法獲得充分原料（麵紛），以致管業大受影饗，但全體局業鑒於切麵亦爲市民主要食糧之一，不容一日或斷，爰各認痛黑市添購原料，繼續製貨，以應市需，昨據該業公會負責人稱：各米店相繼兼一售切麵後，美共名因爲便利市民易於煮食戶口麵粉，但各該米店辦法互異，尅扣份最，及冀獲非分利潤，並無「切麵營業執照」，竟然公開兼售，顯然違反當局法令。反之，本業各會員因礙於法令，及顧全市民生計，不得不勉爲管業，今已遭受嚴重威脅　倘一旦被迫停業，數千工友生計，將何堪設想，因是特具呈當局，予以切實取缔米店兼營切麵。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>檢驗商業體格</h3>
<p>商業構構猶如人類體格，不可以不時加檢騐，以策體格之健全，而檢騐的項目則均有周詳的規定。例如體重如何？心　活動如何？血壓高低如何？欽食消化如伺？在在　爲檢騐人體所必須遵循的幾個綫衆·檢騐商柴機構的原則，也是如此；資本幾何？營　活動如何？利潤多少如何？交易形態如何？在在都足以顯示一個商業機　之是否正常，是否健全。</p>
<p>可是檢騐身體者是醫生，而保養身體者是自己；經過醫生的檢驗以後，即須自己訂爲約束身心的規律，以　體態的健全；商槳機構，也是如此，諸如近來銀行的覆行自　，各業的重訌限價，市傷的買賣章程，以及證交的營業則，無一不是猶如個人約束身心的規律。現在，姑以證交警業細而論，其所規定之懲處各點，不可謂不嚴格、而第七點：「流佈虛僞之風說，行使跪詐之買　，以謀搖動市面者，」以及第九點：「違反一般商業道德認共爲對於該所經紀人間之喪失信用者，」正與本欄以前所論「貍濟毒素」與「商人道德」兩個題目互相映照，而其盡個營弊細則的主旨，正是我們所說過的，就是在證交恢復正式交易以後，要隨時注意於如何防止投機，穩定價格，以期證究市塲，趨於正軌；如是而後華商蹬券交易所自有其健全的商業體格！</p>
<h3>華中對各地間　實施物資交易　商統會統制下交易現况</h3>

<h3>申莊學徒生活實况</h3>
<p>— 頴士</p>
<p>我是一個陋居在三　樓上申莊內的學徒，今年才十七歲，　日躱在常年不間陽光約　房裏，幹着機械式　的奴隸工作，一年，二年、三年時代的巨輸一刻不停的前進着，而我的工作老是這樣刻板，卑　的，一直沒有更改過。十二月八號出口輪雙停頓後，店中職員，辭職的辭職、停歇的停歇，無形中又加上了工作的　負起上至寫信算賬，來往銀行，下至燒飯煮菜，掃地　孟，都有我的責任、閒時還得抱抱小孩，軋軋限價品，終日奔東走西，眞是不勝其苦、</p>
<p>至於薪工呢？却是　乎其微，雖然物價從十元一　米躍到近二十元一擔米的今日，然而我的月規仍停滯在二十元大關上，試　這區區的二十元，可持作伺用呢？我也曾將日常用途儘量的緊縮，但是按月萬不能免的剃頭，洗衣洗澡，鞋，襪等固定的費用，總是按期無問的循環的緊迫着我，結果還是借債了事。</p>
<p>然而，一個剛路進社會未久的費年，有多少親戚朋友好給你備錢呢？而且——而且　惜了是要還的啊，維使給你借了一次，二次，甚至三次之後，如果沒錢歸還的　，以後由肯偕給你嗎？啊！往後的事，絕對不敢再用理智去設想了。</p>
<p>在這　商雲集的上海市裏，一定還有成千萬和我同樣量况的學　們，在奈何天中掙扎有各人的命運，渴待社會來替他們呼一口不平之氣哩！</p>
<p>每見報端刻戰，代難民募捐啦，爲小學教師呼籲哩！然而我們這一軍若干年來被封建思想踐踏善的學徒們，難道就被社會遺忘了麽？不，不，絕對不，在你高唱人類平等的現代世紀裹，一定有許多新思想的人們，爲我們在呼援，同時，我也竭望各界饗應起來，用妥善的辦法調整我們的　活。</p>

<h3>華北實行　决戰生活北燕</h3>
<p>— 北燕</p>
<p>戰爭是一步一步的行上了最後的階段，戰時生活的調整是目前的急務。華北當局在新建設實施工作的最後十天就舉行了促進華北新建設確立決戰土活旬間，使民衆瞭解日常生活和戰爭的關係。這旬間已自本月二十一日開始，王委員　而且　電令華北四省和三市長官轉飭各地於決戰生活旬問不宴會，不飲酒，非必需物件一概不買，公務員上下班時，非不得已不坐車。情報局趙科長也特別爲此次廣播了一動人的演講，而各報紙的論社也都以此作爲主筆先土發輝高論的題材。決戰生活旬問的重要性也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>防空成績良好</p>
<p>北京市因爲防疫的緣故，曾把籌備已久的防空演習暫時停止，讓華北共他各城市去舉行。現在防疫已成過去，防疫措置全面撤除的消息已經於二十二日的報紙上發表出來，而防疫本部也於二十一日正式解散。於是，來空的空氣又歲之而來。新北京報和民衆報社還爲着要使防空思想滲透民間起間舉行過一次防空　語　集運動，應選者屠然有十八名之多，其中第一名陳曉山還得了一百元的獎金。另一方面故都的警防團也舉行了防讀組的訓練大檢閱，由二十二日關始。第一日上午檢閱內一區第一會關，由團本部山下陳雄常任部員及劉鉅濂常任部員檢閥，地點在王府井大街。下午由高級部員孫雲章和山下檢閱內三區第三分團，地點在東四北大街。所檢閱的是防護組員的對定監視動作防火消火動作救體動作，待避及伏臥等動作。據說「成績均為良好」。第二晶　檢閥的是上午內六區，下午內五區。不悄說成績也是均爲良好了，報紙上而且還載有市署定期舉辦防空電影大會的悄息。據說這大會要擠二十九和三十兩天在中央眞光兩仰電影院舉行，除了華北電影公司，提供猿三吉防空戰山之防空大梨燒夷彈等有關防空知識之影片」外，還要由各機關派人演講。</p>
<p>敵產管理成立委會</p>
<p>自從南京國民政府和英吳宣戰以來，被日三所沒收的英美等敵國的在華產業，大部分都由日本歸還，交給南京國民政府管理，其在華北的敵國產櫐則由華北當局決定組織華北敵座管理委員會來管理。委員長是財政總署督辦汪時　，其他的常然委員是政委會政務應長張仲直，秘書廳長祝書元，和各總署署長。這委員會已經於最近籌備好，水月十八日就在財政總署召開成立大會。英美在北京的敵產，其文化機關大體都由中日當局利用。四郊的燕京大學除了住兵外，還辦了一個華北綜合調查硏究所，協和醫院則用於住軍。其他各中小學如教英貝滿等都改爲市立學校，而各醫院，如道濟同仁等也都改爲市立醫院，至於教堂靑年會等則繼續存在，不通是歸華北基督教團管理就是了。</p>
<p>電力節約運動</p>
<p>近日北京人士晚問外出，往往會碰着電燈頓時減絕的現象。據調查，原來這是電燈公司有意的省電辦法，全城分為幾區。輪流的　燈、斷絕電流二十分鐘。可知電力的節省已成爲戰時華北的必要情置了，不但是煅燈，近日報上還登戰有華北各地　省電話資料的情息，就是由華北電話公司決定於十　月一日至十二月三十一日兩個月間把北京，天津，靑島，濟南，徐州　太原，石門　保定。唐山，塘沽，芝罘各地所有不急需和不常用的電話加以統制收囘。收間之後，就由公司付與「一等地六百元，二等地六百元、三籌地四百五十元，四等地四百五十元　五等地四百五十元，六等地三百元」的補償金。這實在是很正當的辦法。另一方面，華北電業公司也自九月一日起限制用戶添設電燈或揰肖，非經公司許可，不可私行　嚴，同時又改　了電至制度，超過一定電量，取費特貴　中國人向來不知愛惜電力，這不但是戰時的一種必要措置，同時也可以給中國人　練成一種愛惜原動力的習　。</p>
<p>解決　荒油荒</p>
<p>北京的　汕二荒現在是愈演意烈。煤球已經漲到每一百斤四元聯鈔的程度。隨着煤的荒，劈柴也大漲價，日來街中鄉下人　來的辟柴已經　到每一百斤三十二元。　荒而發生在　　區的華北可以說是有點莫明其，然而奸商的操縱至少是其中的一個原因。北京市社會局局長　宗紀氏認為這種，「有漲無巳」的現象對於一般市民實在有莫大的害處，就決定對於。皺價格和各煤商存量派員分別予以關查，而且在十九日下論給煤商；「應本自肅觀念，按照公允價格售與市氏不得有　縱居奇之行爲，一經查出或被市民告舉，決予　　不稍寬貸。」至於油均問題。其嚴重化更是想象不到。一切的油坊都停止造油，現在是除了小挑　零油外，一切油　店都不賣油偶爾遇到暗盤交易則花生油每斤　至十元以上。一般人沒有辨法，就到食品商店去買生菜油代替，於是生菜油也從每　四元基右漲到十元上下。然而現在就連生菜油也不容易購到。在這種情形之下，北京市物資價處理文員會就特別於本月二十二日召集北京芝　油業公會和油店業公會關係人員商討解決油荒的辦法、同時又向油店業和芝麻油業等公會開始調查油類來源及其供給情形。（十月二十四日航寄）</p>

<h3>紙烟黑市的由來</h3>
<p>— 公炳</p>
<p>紙烟自今年春季起，由華中烟草配給組合按期統一（包括頤中·中華·華商各廠出品），　給與各小賣商限價出售，小賣商計分甲·乙·丙·了·四級，配給量爲一之四八個，（例如丁級一千元則甲級八千元），第一期配給時日爲今春三月廿大日，刻已　至第十五期，平均約可每月配給二吹，配給數量，了級始終每期在二千元左右。（丙級四千一元，乙級八千元，甲級一一萬六千元）合法利潤規定爲百分之十五，第十三期起提高爲百分之二十。</p>
<p>敝處忝在末級姻紙店之列，每月得配給姻約四千元，規定合法利潤爲八百元　第十三期前僅六百元），查姻紙店係以出管紙姻爲主要營業者，其貿易殆佔　營業額百分之八十强，（敝處即專售捲姻火柴之姻紙店　，試間一姻紙店，若只靠此號稱主要營業之八百元毛利一月，是否即能開支？若再除去厭大捐稅　計有營業捐，牌照捐所得稅經濟局登記費，執照費，以及同業公會會費等）外，恐連水電房錢亦付不出也，更　論伙食薪金。小店既不能開支　大店亦同甲級合法利潤，每月僅六千四瓦元），即不能不　險做黑市以圖存　根本談不到侔利），故愚以爲當局取締黑市固須雷勵風行，但於小　商之合法利潤，亦宜稍稍檢討，務使能雜持最低限度之開支也。</p>
<p>紙姻價格第十三期起，增加一倍餘，照理小賣商合法利潤，可以此例增多一倍餘，乃事實上，極不如此，即增價後之紙烟配給量，突减少一倍餘，致合法利潤，依然如昔，未多分亳。且增價後，雜牌烟增多，幾佔什之八九，（十四期無賢中烟，十五十六期，僅各大英老刀兩盒而已）　牌姻價高質劣，極難脫手，（如高而夫·黎明·黑姑娘·好來西·發遠爾·等，）且須虧本。因雜牌烟要虧本，故不能不將頭中出品價格抬高或搭儘以彌補，此事實之彰彰在人耳目者，不容　飾也。</p>
<p>此黑市之基於小　商方面者，再查黑市之眞正原因，原係由於供求有平衡，（即求多供少），　烟非生活主要品，愚意不妨將其價格，照黑市不斷提高，限價一冗員，消費量必減少，消發量減少，則供求平衡，供求平衡，黑市不絕自絕，故欲徹底消減紙姻黑市　必探用價格提高法，姻廠因之而獲得之過餘利潤，可提充公益用途，紙姻係消　品，有之不多，無之不少。提高價佫，絕不影響平民生計也，（且可將紙烟益價利潤，補貼苦口米售價，則戶口米價格將壓低，造福平民，不可限量，）價格經提高後，小賣商配給數量不減少，則合法利潤，可比例的增多，同時不以雜牌濫竽充數，小賣商能維持開支，自不樂於遠法賣黑市也。</p>
<p>但有一事，亦宣注意，即烟價不斷提高後，如超過黑市售價，因之不能售脫時，在規定限期內，得仍以原價收同，以免小賣商虧折，同時更必須取銷南貨店，百貨店，油酒店之紙烟配給，務使眞正烟紙店之配給量增多，獲得較多之合法利潤，實行以烟紙養烟紙店主義，此則希望於配給組合方面者，以上各點，如能辦到，自是釜底抽薪之根絕黑市辦法，茲再規納如下：　不斷提高限價，減少消費，使供求平衡。　不減少配給量或以雜牌烟濫竽充數，使小賣商合法麗人增多。　限價過高，因之小賣商未能完全售脫時，在相當限期內，組合仍以原價收同未售去部份。　取銷非烟紙店之紙烟配給，一使姻紙店配給量增多。（却　）</p>

        <h1>1943.11.04</h1>
<h3>Social Welfare Undertakings and Winter Relief</h3>
<p>The scope of social welfare undertakings is extremely broad. If properly managed, their effects will not only help maintain social stability but also promote social prosperity. Modern nations attach great importance to social policies, vigorously promoting them with all their might, and this is not without reason. The government has established a dedicated department to oversee their implementation, demonstrating the importance it places on social welfare undertakings.</p>
<p>The state should have a comprehensive plan and detailed program for conducting professional social welfare. Executing the program requires ample funding. In particular, charitable relief undertakings require a large amount of funding, which is a consumption-based recurring expenditure. Naturally, it cannot be borne solely by the national treasury and must be raised from all sectors of society. As for social welfare undertakings organized by private individuals or groups, those inclined towards charitable relief in nature require funding that may be used as a fund or raised temporarily through external donations. Although their purpose falls within the scope of social welfare, they tend to focus on individual good deeds and rarely connect with the overall social welfare undertaking. From the perspective of society as a whole, this should be corrected. In short, unit undertakings can cooperate and concentrate their efforts within the overall undertaking, but they should not act independently and disperse their efforts.</p>
<p>At this point, we already know the importance of social welfare undertakings, and their successful implementation depends on fundraising and the connection of undertakings. In other words, unified fundraising and unified management of undertakings. By using unified strength to promote the entire undertaking, we can make contributions and achieve something in social welfare.</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Social Welfare has drafted the "Outline for Unified Fundraising of Social Welfare Funds in Provinces, Cities, and Counties," which has been promulgated and implemented by the Executive Yuan. As for privately run social welfare undertakings, the Ministry of Social Welfare has also formulated "Rules for Fundraising," which, according to yesterday's newspaper, have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and will be promulgated and implemented soon. Therefore, in the future, there will be a legal basis for unified fundraising for both public and private undertakings. We hope that after unified fundraising, unified management of undertakings can be gradually realized in the near future under careful planning.</p>
<p>In addition, it was reported that the central and municipal social welfare fundraising committees have been established. The selection of committee members was carefully discussed and decided by the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the first joint meeting of the central and Shanghai social welfare fundraising committees was held yesterday afternoon. Among the important items discussed was the fundraising plan for the city's winter relief for the 32nd year. We raised the issue of "preparing for winter relief" in our editorial on the 21st of last month, and specifically advocated that: first, the importance of timeliness should be emphasized, and preparations should be made calmly, not hastily; second, the importance of comprehensive strength should be emphasized, and communication and consistency should be achieved between government agencies and social organizations, and among various organizations, in order to achieve the efficiency of comprehensive strength. We are aware that the winter relief held in our city last year was too late, and in fact, it was already the time for spring relief. Now that it has been decided to hold winter relief, it must be done quickly. Now that it has been stipulated that a special committee will be responsible for fundraising, it must be implemented quickly. Start planning the fundraising methods and measures immediately, starting from the 16th of this month and ending at the end of this year, lasting for one and a half months. If we can proceed actively, it will not be hasty. Secondly, regarding the content of winter relief, we have already offered some preliminary views before, and it is worth repeating at this time that active guidance undertakings should be emphasized more than passive relief undertakings, such as small loans to help people make a living, sheltering and educating homeless children, and organizing light handicrafts to enable the unemployed to work, etc. Communication should be established between various relief organizations to improve the efficiency of relief work and reduce fraud.</p>
<p>Social welfare undertakings, led by the government and assisted by the people, should, in theory, have a bright future with satisfactory results. This winter relief in our city is the best test of cooperation between officials and civilians. The quality of their cooperation can determine the quality of the results. Let us wait and see.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was Japan's Meiji Day: The Emperor Personally Performed Sacrifices, Prime Minister Tojo and Others Visited the Palace to Offer Congratulations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Today was Japan's Meiji Day festival. A solemn ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace. His Majesty the Emperor personally performed sacrifices. Prince Chichibu and other members of the imperial family also visited the palace at 11:00 AM to pay respects to the Emperor and Empress and offer congratulations. Prime Minister Tojo and other civil and military officials also successively visited the palace to leave messages of congratulations. In addition, the Meiji Shrine held a regular festival at 8:00 AM this morning, with Minister of Internal Affairs Ando, Minister of the Navy Shimada, Chief of General Staff Motoyama, and others attending. It then held a Meiji Day festival at 11:00 AM. Furthermore, the entire Japanese nation simultaneously paid respects to the Meiji Shrine at 9:00 AM in the morning to commemorate the great achievements of Emperor Meiji.</p>
<h3>American Air Force Heavily Damages Bougainville Island: 500 Aircraft Shot Down in Three and a Half Months</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army withdrew from Kolombangara Island, the American offensive in the Solomon Islands has concentrated on Bougainville Island and New Britain Island. Recently, a large number of aircraft have been mobilized and continuously dispatched in an attempt to inflict heavy damage on the Japanese army's front-line bases. The Japanese naval air force and the army and navy ground forces have established a strong defensive posture against this counterattack by the enemy. If the enemy does not move, they will not be attacked, but if they do, they will be dealt a heavy blow. According to the figures released by the Japanese General Headquarters and the battle results from the front-line bases, from July 17, after the enemy landed on Rendova Island, to the end of October, in the three and a half months since the invasion of Bougainville Island, the total number of enemy aircraft attacking the island reached 3,589, of which 504 were shot down, a shooting down rate of over 14%. Assuming an average of five people per bomber and fighter plane, the loss of enemy airmen in Bougainville Island alone is no less than 2,520. In addition, adding the losses of the enemy forces in the entire Solomon Islands and New Guinea, regardless of the loss of aircraft, the loss of thousands of airmen is not small. Furthermore, considering the enemy's lack of airmen, the severity of the damage they have suffered can be imagined.</p>
<p>Airman Okumura and Others Talk About Their Experiences in Air Combat</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain base in the South Pacific, the intensity of the fighting in the Solomon Islands has reached its peak. The Japanese naval air force on Bougainville Island near Buin, on September 14th, intercepted over 340 attacking enemy aircraft, and together with ground fire, shot down 60 of them. The Japanese aircraft also sacrificed five aircraft. On this day of air combat, Airman Okumura of the fighter squadron was the most active, shooting down ten enemy aircraft in one day, including one large aircraft and nine fighter planes. The commander of a certain fleet specially awarded him a white-sheathed military sword with the inscription "Exceptional Military Achievement." In order to understand the truth about the enemy on this day, the reporter visited Airman Okumura and other air combat heroes who had performed outstanding deeds. They described the details of the air combat on that day: "At 6:30 AM that day, we received news of an enemy aircraft invasion. Several fighter planes immediately took off for patrol. After 35 minutes, we saw a large formation of enemy aircraft flying in from Rendova Island. We made preparations to intercept them. The weather was clear that day, making it an excellent day for air combat. In an instant, the enemy aircraft arrived, and we immediately engaged in a fierce air battle with eleven Type Zero fighter planes and thirty occupational fighter planes. Senior Airman Okumura was the first to shoot down a Sikorsky-type enemy aircraft, and then we successively shot down seven enemy fighter planes. As a result, all the enemy fighter planes were scattered, leaving only the large bombers. Japanese aircraft once attacked a large enemy aircraft. Airman Okumura was the first to hit the aircraft, and chased after it at maximum speed. After 30 minutes, the enemy aircraft was hit by more than ten bullets, burst into flames, and crashed. At 8:00 AM on the same day, enemy aircraft flew over the airfield and dropped bombs. Several Japanese aircraft also took off at this time, but it was a little late. Twelve Type Zero aircraft and thirty fighter planes had already fled into the distance. By 8:40 AM, because the enemy aircraft had fled without a trace, the Japanese aircraft were about to land, but the signal from the ground told them to 'delay landing' and wait in the air. However, the enemy aircraft never came. When we wanted to land again, the signal still called for a delay. In an instant, a total of forty enemy aircraft, including P-38s and B-24s, flew in from an altitude of 6,000 meters. However, the P-38 and B-24 enemy aircraft were no match for the Japanese aircraft. After a fierce battle of 30 minutes, more than half of the enemy aircraft were shot down, a total of 22, including two P-38 enemy aircraft and one B-24 enemy aircraft shot down by Airman Okumura. Afterwards, several Japanese aircraft landed at a certain base due to lack of fuel. Airman Okumura and another aircraft returned to Buin for a short rest, and the maintenance crew replenished fuel and ammunition. Just as we were about to replenish oxygen, the enemy aircraft attacked again, and we had to fly out again. The maintenance crew on the ground, worried about the lack of oxygen, shouted 'Do not fly above a certain number of kilometers!' Then several of our aircraft took off and waited. As expected, we discovered a large number of enemy carrier-based bombers and fighter planes flying in, 50 of the former and 60 of the latter. At this time, our morale became even higher, and we rushed into the enemy aircraft formation, which was several times larger than ours, regardless of everything. Enemy aircraft were successively shot down. After 30 minutes of air combat, a total of five enemy carrier-based bombers and twenty fighter planes were shot down, including one carrier-based bomber and four B-24 enemy aircraft shot down by Airman Okumura. Airman Okumura has shot down 50 enemy aircraft since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and has now set a record of 54 enemy aircraft shot down. A certain commander said that shooting down enemy aircraft over a long period of time is not new, but the record of shooting down ten enemy aircraft in one day is still rare. Airman Okumura's attacking spirit and strong physique are truly admirable."</p>
<h3>The Chongqing Side Is Extremely Disturbed After the Sino-Japanese Alliance, The People Unanimously Yearn for Peace</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) - This conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty seems to have greatly disturbed the Chongqing side, so the Chongqing authorities have maintained a silent attitude and have not made any statement to this day. At present, Chongqing, whether politically, militarily, economically, or socially, has fallen into a difficult position from which it cannot extricate itself. It merely hopes for the shifting of the world war situation and the international situation, relying on external forces to prolong its life. The results of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Chongqing Kuomintang are the best proof of the worsening situation it is in. However, Chongqing has not yet taken any positive measures to solve the difficult situation of rising prices and rampant inflation. It is using Chiang Kai-shek's assumption of the chairmanship as a deceptive policy, and so-called post-war construction and other sweet words to deceive the people. At the same time, although the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Chongqing Kuomintang decided to implement constitutional government within one year after the war, it no longer mentions the implementation of its Four Northwestern Constructions and price countermeasures. This is enough to prove the political ills of Chongqing. In terms of military affairs, its combat strength is declining day by day. Although the Chongqing side is eager to seize Burma to determine the path of Chongqing's survival, it has been struck by the Japanese army's operation in the Nu River in Yunnan Province, and its connection with the British and American forces has been cut off. The Chongqing side is now in a forced situation where external assistance is cut off, and it admits that it is unable to solve this difficult situation, and is merely seeking to rely on external forces to prolong its time. This fragility has caused great turmoil among the powerful classes supporting the war of resistance, and the people's hearts are exhausted due to the bleak prospects of the war of resistance, and they are all looking forward to peace. Recently, a certain official of the Chongqing side who arrived in the Lunan peace zone stated that the people of Chongqing are mostly looking forward to the arrival of peace. The anti-Japanese theories of the Chongqing intellectuals have been shaken by the concretization of Japan's new policy towards China. Guilin, the central city of southwestern China, is also full of hope for peace, and the impact of this Sino-Japanese alliance treaty on Chongqing is even deeper. This time, if Chairman Wang denounces Chongqing's war of resistance, it will be known that its war of resistance is not for China, but for Britain and the United States, which will inevitably cause strong opposition from the people.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Shot Down Over Yangon</h3>
<p>A certain base in Myanmar, 3rd (Central News Agency) - At 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, the British Air Force sent a new, fast reconnaissance aircraft, the "Mosquito," to invade the airspace over Yangon. It was immediately intercepted by a new Japanese fighter aircraft and shot down. It is reported that the British reconnaissance aircraft was originally intended to be made into a light bomber to bomb Germany, but it did not achieve any results, so the plan was changed to make it into a twin-engine wooden reconnaissance aircraft, which first appeared in the skies over the India-Myanmar border in July. This reconnaissance aircraft claimed by the British is powerless before the new Japanese fighter aircraft.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Is Deeply Dissatisfied With Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The Chongqing side is deeply dissatisfied with the lack of sincerity of Britain and the United States in assisting Chongqing. The Chongqing organ newspaper, the Central Daily News, recently published an article criticizing Britain's cold attitude. The main points are as follows: Since American senators returned home after inspecting the front lines, they have stated that Britain has not made sufficient efforts to assist Chongqing, and we deeply agree with this. In addition to criticizing Britain's irresponsible attitude, we also hope that Britain will express itself on this matter. In addition, Britain adds British marks to the military equipment loaned by the United States to Austria and sends it to other countries in an attempt to gain an advantageous position after the war, and we are extremely unhappy with this behavior.</p>

This signing of the alliance treaty is the culmination of the development of Sino-Japanese relations.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Army Captured Crimea But Faced Strong German Resistance; Landing Forces on the Kerch Peninsula Were Annihilated</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced the Eastern Front situation on the 2nd as follows: German forces launched a successful counterattack north of Kryvyi Rih and thwarted the Soviet attempt to land in Crimea; Soviet forces attempted to land on both sides of the Kerch Peninsula on the Eastern Front. German forces encircled and annihilated the Soviet forces at one location, forcing them into a small area. German forces also heavily damaged Soviet forces at other landing sites; German forces continued to fight Soviet mechanized units attacking in the southern Nohai Steppe downstream of the Dnieper River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: The center of the autumn battle on the Eastern Front is currently south of Kryvyi Rih, where both sides are engaged in a war of attrition with large tank units and artillery. The outcome is unpredictable. Both sides have transferred reinforcements. The battle in this area, as well as the battles north of Kryvyi Rih, in the Nohai Steppe, and in the Kerch Strait, should be regarded as part of the large battle currently underway. The Soviet forces are attempting to isolate the Crimean Peninsula by blockading it from the north and attacking it from the east, but the German forces have apparently anticipated this development. Powerful Soviet forces attempting to land on both sides of the Kerch Peninsula were almost completely annihilated before they even reached the coast. The Soviet forces protecting the operation failed to establish a beachhead. As a result, the Soviet forces only completed their landing at one location. It is expected that the Soviet forces will continue to attempt to land in the future, so the eastern coast of the peninsula seems to have been strongly defended by the German forces. The situation north of Crimea is not optimistic for the Soviet forces either. The German command does not have any reason to withdraw from Crimea. Regarding this point, the Soviet claim to have conquered Perekop has not been confirmed by the German forces. It is possible that a few scattered Soviet tanks are operating in the nearby flat, treeless area. But even if this is the case, these tanks would encounter strong German obstacles in the Perekop Isthmus. The main force of enemy motorized units continues to target the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, which raises a number of interesting possibilities within a certain scope.</p>
<h3>German Forces Continuously Counterattacking on the West Bank of the Dnieper River</h3>
<p>However, Soviet military officials continue to remain silent on this point, as they do on the German victory north of Kryvyi Rih. But the figures contained in the Soviet war report on Tuesday provide some clues. What is even more noteworthy is that the German losses north of Kryvyi Rih were actually very light. Although the fighting in the area lasted for many days, the German command did not need to reorganize its forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: On Monday, the focus of the fighting in the Dnieper River bend remained north of Kryvyi Rih, where German harassment teams annihilated scattered Soviet units. Prior to this, the connection between these Soviet units and their main force had been severed, and they were hiding in deep valleys. According to current reports, 21 Soviet tanks were destroyed in this military operation, including three of the heaviest type. At the same time, the spearheads of the German tanks continued to attack fiercely and made further gains on the ground. The fierce fighting between the Saksagan River and the Inhulets River continues. In one area alone, approximately 12,000 Soviet soldiers were killed, which shows the intensity of the fighting in the area in the past week and the heavy losses suffered by the Soviet forces. German forces captured more than 5,000 Red Army prisoners and seized a large number of tanks and artillery, as detailed in the German war report on Tuesday. The Soviet forces' attempts to attack fiercely to the southwest and northwest in the Kryvyi Rih area in order to relieve their oppressed main force were completely ineffective.</p>
<p>Tug-of-War Continues in the Nohai Steppe</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to the Overseas Chinese News Agency: The German counterattack in the Great Dnieper bend is still gradually progressing. German reinforcements are continuously arriving at the front line, so the German attack power will continue to increase. The Soviet forces that have penetrated into the Nohai Steppe have not made much progress either. German forces have established positions on the edge of the steppe to prevent enemy forces from entering Crimea and crossing the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. Although these positions were subjected to the most severe pressure on Monday, they have not collapsed. In the main part of the steppe, the mobile units of the Soviet and German forces are engaged in a tug-of-war. In the course of the fighting, the Soviet forces continue to advance towards the mouth of the Dnieper River. The Soviet landing operation in the Kerch Strait cannot be considered successful from the perspective of the overall war situation. On Monday, the Soviet forces launched local attacks within the area from Kryvyi Rih to Minsk and Smolensk on the Eastern Front, especially fierce to the east of a certain auxiliary area and southwest of Gomel, but the enemy forces have not gained anything.</p>
<h3>Light Snow Has Fallen on the Northern Section of the Eastern Front; Climate in the South Is Deteriorating</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: The weather in the southern part of the Eastern Front has deteriorated, but military activity has not been affected. The muddy season in the north has gradually begun, slowing down military operations in the area. There have even been reports of light snow in some places.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Coal Mine Strike by Lewis and Ickes: Severe Fuel Shortage in Various Parts of the US</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Washington reports that Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, conferred with US Secretary of the Interior Ickes on Tuesday regarding the coal mine strike. Only a small number of miners returned to work on Tuesday. In Pennsylvania, only 28,000 out of 80,000 miners resumed work.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Washington reports that Roosevelt issued an order to the eastern coal miners on the 1st, instructing them to cease striking. However, these miners showed a defiant attitude towards the President's order, taking concerted action and continuing the strike. Miners who were working also joined the strike. As a result, a general strike of 530,000 workers in the coal mine workers' union has formed. Except for some workers affiliated with the American Federation of Labor who continue to work, coal mining in eastern America has completely stopped. Roosevelt set the deadline for ending the strike at the morning of the 3rd. The striking workers stated that unless the union headquarters issued an order to end the strike, they would not cease striking even if the President designated a deadline for resumption of work. Therefore, the attitude of union president Lewis is attracting great attention. Lewis met twice on the 2nd with Ickes, the Director of the Fuel Administration, who is responsible for government-controlled coal mines. At the same time, the union's policy committee further postponed its decision for three days. Prior to the formation of this general strike, there had already been a prolonged strike, so from the first day of the general strike, the US has been experiencing a severe fuel shortage. Coal for steelmaking in Birmingham relies on the supply from coal mines in West Alabama. Currently, due to the coal shortage, smelting furnaces have been shut down. Major cities across the US, including New England and Pittsburgh, are reporting a shortage of civilian coal. For example, New York's civilian coal reserves are only enough for the next two or three days. According to observations from the coal mine owners, even if the miners return to work on the morning of the 3rd according to Roosevelt's orders, it will take at least a week for the coal mines to return to their pre-strike state. Fuel Administration Director Ickes issued a freeze order on the 2 million tons of coal currently being transported on the 2nd, and decided to suspend allocations to coal storage operators from the 10th, and to strengthen restrictions on civilian coal allocations to prevent any contingency.</p>
<h3>US Officials Deny Freezing Argentine Funds</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports from New York that officials have stated that the US has not frozen the funds of Argentine banks. This is in response to yesterday's report that the US Treasury Department had frozen the assets of two Argentine banks in Washington.</p>
<h3>The National Government Promotes a Decisive Economic War: Interview with Minister of Industry Chen by Japanese Journalists</h3>
<p>The National Government's economic policy is gradually establishing a genuine wartime economy through the compulsory purchase of cotton yarn, cloth, and rice. During the recent reshuffle of ministerial-level figures in the National Government, Chairman Wang resolutely replaced the Minister of Industry, the authority responsible for economic measures. This illustrates the National Government's determination to implement wartime economic measures. Therefore, the aspirations of the new Minister of Industry, Mr. Chen Junhui, are of utmost importance in terms of the future direction of the National Government's economic policies. Mr. Miyamori, a reporter from the Mainichi Shimbun, met with the new minister and learned of his aspirations regarding the current economic situation and future policies.</p>
<p>Q: The National Government's wartime economic measures have taken a genuine first step with the compulsory purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. What are your views on the actual situation of the economic world?</p>
<p>A: The outline for the wartime economy was decided at the beginning of this year, which shows the general picture of the wartime economic policy. The question is how to realize it. In the future, to promote wartime economic policies, first, we will focus on the spirit of the decree and complete the increase in production of necessities and the adjustment of supply and demand of materials. Second, we will strengthen private economic institutions to adapt to the wartime economic system, and officials and civilians will cooperate to vigorously promote the wartime economic policy. Third, the relevant government authorities, from planning to implementation, from the central to the local level, will strengthen the content of various institutions in both vertical and horizontal aspects, and further tighten the relationship between various agencies, so as to take a consistent pace and promote policies towards common goals.</p>
<p>Q: The National General Chamber of Commerce is the central organization for the National Government to implement wartime economic policies. How to make good use of it seems to be the key to the success or failure of the National Government's economic policy. What are the improvement plans?</p>
<p>A: In order to operate the General Chamber of Commerce and to establish a close relationship with the National Government, the following three points must be implemented:</p>
<p>First, under the guidance of the government, the General Chamber of Commerce should exert the automatic control spirit and dynamic power of the private sector, and use it for the purchase and allocation of materials and the increase in production, so as to implement the wartime economic policy. Second, the government should give substantial assistance to the General Chamber of Commerce, and at the same time, the General Chamber of Commerce should also make its best efforts to the government. In this way, the completion of the wartime economic policy can be expected, and the reality of official-civilian cooperation can be realized. Third, the government is promoting the implementation of wartime economic policies and actively implementing the strengthening of administrative institutions. Future reforms will be implemented one by one based on actual needs. However, the unification of policies, the adjustment of pace, and the consistency of intentions are indispensable conditions.</p>
<p>Q: For example, regarding the compulsory purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, how can this spirit of authoritarian control help improve people's livelihoods? It seems necessary to make concrete efforts to show this to the public.</p>
<p>A: It is most important for the public to understand the controlled economy. The public must fully understand the policy and understand it through implementation based on facts. Therefore, we must continue to present the facts and actively promote publicity and enlightenment. In terms of publicity work, make them understand the Greater East Asia War and restrain individual interests during wartime.</p>
<p>Q: How will the types of controlled commodities be expanded and the scope of regions expanded after cotton yarn and cloth?</p>
<p>A: To promote wartime economic policies, we must strengthen the controlled economy. Therefore, first, we will implement the principle of centralism and implement control around this center. Second, the conditions for implementing full control in China are not yet fully available, so we hope to actively carry out preparatory work to complete all conditions. Third, we must quickly complete the implementation of the economic control plan under the wartime system. Therefore, the government hopes to start with simple and feasible parts, make its best efforts, and implement strong control.</p>
<p>Q: What is the actual situation of Chinese national capital? Also, what are your thoughts on the ideal of restoring industry and Sino-Japanese division of labor?</p>
<p>A: There are two questions here. One is the utilization of factories returned by the Japanese side, and the other is the issue of the use of national capital necessary for this. Utilizing national capital is the most important task. Therefore, we must eliminate the various conditions that hinder factory operation. That is to say, through the rationalization of investment, to ensure profits, supplement raw materials and fuels, promote the exchange of materials between industry and agriculture, to seek the rational allocation of material procurement, allocation, and production. Especially, the development of Shanghai's industry and the exchange of materials with the interior are the most important prerequisites. Currently, the revival of Shanghai's industry is slow. As for the Sino-Japanese division of labor, of course, China engages in light industry and Japan engages in heavy industry. However, in the current situation in China, many people do not understand the distinction between so-called heavy industry and light industry. Therefore, some people think, to what extent can China do heavy industry, and can China not do the heavy industry that China can do on its own?</p>
<p>Q: The controlled economy uses power to grasp the economy. Power depends on credibility. To achieve practical results, it depends on whether there is clean politics to implement the controlled economy. What are the methods?</p>
<p>A: To promote the controlled economy, the thoroughness of clean politics is an indispensable condition. Therefore, in the passive aspect, the government has already formulated punishment laws, and hopes to thoroughly implement them in the future. In the active aspect, improve the treatment of civil servants and strengthen supervision and guidance to various agencies, hoping to obtain the results of clean politics from this. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen political training for civil servants, such as the New National Movement.</p>
<p>Q: What are the National Government's hopes for Japan in the promotion of economic policies?</p>
<p>A: First, the implementation of the New China Policy is most appreciated by the Chinese people, and we hope to further implement this spirit. Second, eliminating the regional economy existing in China is what the people unanimously hope for. Third, increasing production is the most important countermeasure. In terms of technology, transportation, and other aspects, we hope to provide the greatest assistance within the possible range. (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, October 21st)</p>
<h3>US Labor Union Congress Demands Repeal of Two Bills</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Philadelphia reports that the American Federation of Labor Congress recently held its sixth annual meeting here and resolved to demand that the government immediately repeal the No-Strike Act and the Universal Low-Wage Iron Factory Wage Act. The main points of the two proposals are as follows: Repeal the No-Strike Act. Observing the government's brutal expansion of actions against labor unions is tantamount to indicating the dangers of democracy and the future of the war. The establishment of such legislation is detrimental to the patriotism of workers and the unity of the nation. The government should immediately abolish this evil law. Repeal the Universal Low-Wage Iron Factory Wage Act. The people have great expectations for a sound and stable economic policy, but it is unfortunate that it has not yet been realized. At a time when a strong price policy and a comprehensive allocation system are implemented before taxation is implemented, workers' wages must be adjusted from time to time. The government should abandon the stabilization wage policy based on the universal low-wage iron factory wage law.</p>
<h3>Over Ten Thousand People Strike in Western Scotland Due to Unsuccessful Wage Increase Demands</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - London reports that 10,000 workers in the heavy industry of western Scotland began a strike yesterday because their demands for a wage increase were rejected. Workers in other similar industries are also planning to join the strike today.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) - London reports that 10,000 female workers and other workers in an engine manufacturing factory in Glasgow, England, began a strike on the 1st due to demands for improved treatment. Although the General Federation of Trade Unions immediately carried out appeasement work, more than 10,000 workers also joined the strike.</p>
<h3>Republican Party Wins US State Elections</h3>
<p>Geneva, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports from Washington that according to the initial results of yesterday's state elections in the US, the Republican Party received more votes than the Democratic Party. The Republican Party has the upper hand in New York, and a Republican Party member has been elected as the Lieutenant Governor of the state by a majority of votes. The Governor of New Jersey has repeatedly belonged to the Republican Party, and the Republican Party also has an advantage in Philadelphia.</p>
<h3>Spanish Government Appoints Chargé d'Affaires to China</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Spanish government recently appointed Kong Shi Lei Xi Ge Li Ya Li Bo Si, the first secretary of the Spanish embassy in Manchukuo and concurrently Chargé d'Affaires, as the interim Chargé d'Affaires to China. Spanish Foreign Minister Yueh Tan Na recently sent a special telegram to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government for reference. The original telegram is as follows: To His Excellency the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, I hereby appoint Kong Shi Lei Xi Ge Li Ya Li Bo Si, the first secretary of the Spanish Embassy in Manchukuo and concurrently Chargé d'Affaires, as the interim Chargé d'Affaires to the National Government of the Republic of China. Best regards, Yueh Tan Na, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain.</p>
<h3>Argentina Expresses Strict Neutrality</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Argentine Foreign Minister General Gilberto recently said in an interview with a reporter from a Chilean newspaper stationed there that Argentina does not want to be an enemy of any country in the world. Therefore, Argentina will maintain complete and absolute neutrality. This attitude of Argentina is not unique. For example, the Soviet Union has not declared war on Japan. In Europe, there are Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, and even Ireland that continue to adhere firmly to neutrality. Turkey also adopts the same policy. Therefore, Argentina has no reason not to adopt this same neutral policy, and this policy is completely consistent with the psychology of the Argentine people. Argentina is willing to be friends with anyone. Only countries that infringe on Argentina's sovereignty and dignity will Argentina sever diplomatic relations with. Argentina is independent in handling its own affairs and has no external pressure. The current government is the strongest government it has ever been.</p>
<h3>Relations between Japan and the Soviet Union Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency), Huitong News Agency reports from London that well-informed sources in Moscow strongly state that Japanese-Soviet relations will not change due to the anti-Axis cooperation decided at the Moscow Conference.</p>
<h3>Results of the Moscow Conference: A Diplomatic Victory for the Soviet Union; Several Points of the Four-Nation Declaration are Worthy of Attention</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - As a result of the Moscow talks between representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, a joint four-nation declaration and a joint communique between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union were issued. The following points are noteworthy: In the four-nation joint declaration, the Chongqing side is merely a figurehead. Although Fu Bingchang, the Chongqing Ambassador to the Soviet Union, is nominally included, the joint declaration and the joint communique do not involve the position or interests of the Chongqing side, but only attempt to deal with it with abstract and general decisions. It is only natural that the Chongqing side was not invited to the talks. Its status in the joint declaration is only formal and subordinate. The joint declaration and the joint communique only discuss European issues and do not touch on East Asian issues at all. This is clear evidence that the Moscow talks downplayed the status of the Chongqing side and made no concrete decisions on East Asian issues. As recognized in the joint communique, many of the proposals put forward at the trilateral talks have not yet been resolved, such as the so-called "attached committees" delegated to future diplomatic handling. The issue of the second front was not clearly studied. The so-called "military issues that have been decided" in the joint communique are undoubtedly centered on the Soviet Union's demands. Regarding the results of the discussion of political issues proposed by the UK and the US, key points such as southwestern Europe, South Asia, and Northern Europe were avoided, and only issues of Italy and Germany and the Austrian issue, which the Soviet Union considered unimportant, were raised. This is also the Soviet Union's intention to suppress the UK and the US, and the discussion of political issues stopped midway. In short, the results of the Moscow talks were the same as expected beforehand, a diplomatic victory for the Soviet Union. In other words, the UK and the US have always followed the Soviet Union. What has troubled the UK and the US the most is that the "Hull-Molotov talks" issue, which had the greatest expectations for this meeting, did not yield any results, and only a joint declaration was issued with the empty names of the three gentlemen. From this point of view, it can be said that this meeting has been half a failure.</p>
<p>Effectiveness of the Agreement</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Washington reports that a spokesperson for the US State Department declared on Wednesday that although the agreement signed in Moscow has not been ratified, it has the same effect as a treaty in international law for each signatory country, as do the details regarding the implementation of the agreement.</p>
<p>German Commentary</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German Foreign Office expressed its views on the Moscow Conference communique on the 2nd as follows: The Moscow Conference communique is the UK and the US surrendering to the Soviet Union's hegemony in Europe, confirming that the whole of Europe is succumbing to communist forces. Judging from the content of this communique, it can be seen that the policies of the UK and the US have completely failed. This communique does not mention European countries that have interests related to the Soviet Union, but instead raises the issue of Austria. However, Austria became part of Germany in 1938 based on the free vote of the people. This is the principle of democratic voting and merging with Germany after the world war, but the UK and the US believe that the results of the people's vote are contrary to the Treaty of Versailles, so they declare it invalid. The Atlantic Charter touts national self-determination, but does not respect the will of the people of the country, and strongly demands so-called "freedom of a democratic nature," which is difficult for the world to understand. The communique criticizes the German army and the National Socialist Party, but considering the fact that the Soviet army massacred a large number of Polish soldiers in the Katyn Forest, this criticism is a shameless statement. German newspapers also wrote separate criticisms on the 2nd. The Hamburg "Hamburger Fremdenblatt" stated that the communique listed various words and phrases and is a strange document. The points not mentioned in the communique are perhaps more important than those mentioned, and it does not fundamentally mention the proposals on which the representatives of the three countries could not agree. In particular, no agreement was made regarding the Soviet Union's borders, which is clear evidence of the UK and the US succumbing to the Soviet Union. Some members of the German public also said that this communique was as expected, focusing on the psychological warfare aspect. From a military and political point of view, there were no results. The results of this meeting have determined that the most powerful party in the anti-Axis camp is the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Romania is Deeply Concerned</p>
<p>Bucharest, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Romanian political figures commented on the final communique of the Moscow Conference, saying that because Romania is one of the small countries bordering the Soviet Union on the west, it is greatly affected by the territorial proposals decided at the Moscow Conference. The Soviet Army newspaper "Red Star" once said that after defeating Finland, the Red Army did not consider itself satisfied. Therefore, the Romanian newspaper pointed out that neighboring countries all shared the same fate as Finland.</p>
<h3>German Troops Deploy Trapezoidal Defense Line in Italian Mountain Area; British and American Advances are Slow</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced the battle situation in southern Italy: US troops launched several offensives in the area west of the Volturno River in the evening, which were repelled. East of the river, enemy troops were tracking the rearguard units of the German army that were retreating, and were heavily damaged by heavy artillery and aircraft bombing.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: From Monday to noon on Tuesday, the situation along the Adriatic coast and the Trigno River remained unchanged. On the left wing of the British Eighth Army in the central Apennine Mountains, activities began again, but they only advanced a few kilometers, and had not yet crossed the line from Cartaluho to Fresoione as of Monday. The British vanguard advancing towards Isernia was blocked by German artillery fire, but the main force continued to push forward. To their left, part of the US Fifth Army attempted to encircle the German troops occupying Mount Miletto, in order to eliminate the threat to the flank of the US troops in the Volturno Valley. The US troops continued to attack Venefro on Monday without progress. The center of the US Fifth Army is now attacking Mount Croce. After occupying Teano, they were unable to continue advancing along the foothills. In the battle of Teano, the US military suffered heavy losses, with 21 tanks destroyed. In the coastal area of ​​the Gulf of Gaeta, the left wing of the US troops temporarily stopped advancing after crossing the small city of Montella, but the artillery and assault teams intensified their activities, which are expected to be a prelude to a general offensive. In general, the German army has deployed a trapezoidal array along the mountains, equipped with new heavy weapons. It will be difficult for the enemy to cross.</p>

<h3>Special Edition on the Burma Campaign: Overview of the Burmese Theater</h3>
<p>Mountbatten Convenes Meeting</p>
<p>Upon assuming office as the new Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia, Lord Mountbatten immediately convened a military conference in New Delhi. Present were British and Indian military commanders, including General Auchinleck, Air Marshal Peirse, Admiral Somerville, Vice-Admiral Godfrey, Major General Davidson (Commander of the U.S. Tenth Air Force stationed in India), General Stilwell (Commander of U.S. Forces in the China-Burma-India Theater stationed in Chongqing), Song Ziwen (Foreign Minister of the Chongqing government), liaison officers, and many others. The conference focused on the recovery of Burma and coordinated the Allied counter-offensive strategy in East Asia. Subsequently, on the 16th, he invited Lieutenant General Sir Henry Pownall, Chief of Staff of the Southeast Asia Command, to a meeting on "Operations in the Southeast Asian Theater." The headquarters of the Southeast Asia Command is clearly actively engaged. This Allied counter-offensive in East Asia is based solely on the common views of Britain and the United States at the Quebec Conference. Its scale is undoubtedly far greater than the Arakan offensive this spring. It is not difficult to imagine this. But how exactly are the British, American, and Chongqing forces preparing to implement their counter-offensive plan? Let us examine the enemy's intelligence, assess their strength, and review their operational plans.</p>
<p>Enemy Force Estimates</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the enemy's forces currently in India include hundreds of thousands of British troops, three divisions of the Chongqing Expeditionary Force stationed in India (approximately 50,000 men), 30,000 U.S. troops stationed in India, and an air force consisting of five squadrons of the British Royal Air Force and one division of the U.S. Air Force, totaling approximately 1,500 aircraft. However, this entire force is not entirely concentrated in the Southeast Asian theater.</p>
<p>Approximately 200,000 ground troops are deployed east of Calcutta, with approximately 150,000 in the eastern sector and 50,000 from Chongqing. Similarly, approximately 500 aircraft are also deployed in the eastern sector.</p>
<p>Enemy's Future Strategy</p>
<p>With this force, the enemy may attempt to break through the Nu River front in the north, connecting the Arakan Mountains, the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar Islands, the Sabang, Nias, and Mentawai Islands – the weakest point in the Japanese arc-shaped defense line. However, the enemy must disperse their forces. Will they attempt to break through Arakan? Or launch a landing operation in southern Burma? Perhaps use the Andaman, Nicobar, or Mentawai Islands to strike at Sumatra, concentrating their attack there. However, the natural barriers of the Arakan peaks do not allow for large-scale, rapid operations by the enemy's forces. The enemy's invasion routes are limited to two: the Imphal route directly to the Kaladan River in central Arakan, and the coastal route south from Chittagong via Cox's Bazar and Teknaf. Moreover, the wounds from the British-Indian army's "Arakan tragedy" this spring have not yet healed. How dare they contemplate challenging Arakan head-on again? If so, where will the 150,000 troops concentrated on the eastern Indo-Burmese border and the southern Indian army find their point of attack? Regarding this matter, a Reuters dispatch on August 25, titled "Southeast Pacific Allied Operations," offers the following observations:</p>
<p>Ensuring Naval Supremacy in the Bay of Bengal</p>
<p>Recapturing the Nicobar and Andaman Islands</p>
<p>Surprise Landing on the Burmese Coast</p>
<p>It also points out that Admiral Lord Mountbatten, a renowned expert in surprise landing operations, has assumed command of the Southeast Asia Command, emphasizing the possibility of the southern Indian army launching an offensive against the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Enemy broadcasts also claim that they have heavy troop concentrations between Calcutta and Chittagong and have made thorough preparations for air power, which is crucial to the success of a landing operation. However, the "Ethnic Weekly" in the United Kingdom expresses a pessimistic view regarding the maritime transport for the landing force's supply lines, stating:</p>
<p>Landings Are Extremely Difficult</p>
<p>"Supplying landing forces is extremely difficult, at most securing a small bridgehead militarily." If a large-scale naval offensive is launched from Ceylon or southern India, a single division's offensive would require an estimated 300,000 tons of shipping. If 200,000 troops are involved, at least 5 million tons of shipping would be needed. However, the Indian Ocean fleet alone is definitely not sufficient for navigation. It would be necessary to reinforce with the British Mediterranean Fleet, which is currently operating in the eastern Mediterranean. To complete all preparations would take at least until the end of this year, so the offensive would not be possible until the beginning of next year. If the offensive target is, as Reuters suggests, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, we can infer the following points from the distances involved. From Ceylon to the Andaman Islands is 1,080 kilometers, and to the Nicobar Islands is 1,150 kilometers. If Calcutta is used as the base, then it is 1,180 kilometers to the Andaman Islands and 1,570 kilometers to the Nicobar Islands. Based on our air power, Japan has already secured more than twice the advantage of the enemy. The enemy's reliance on aircraft carrier supply would be entirely under the fierce power of Japanese land-based aircraft, leaving them no other way out.

<h3>Anglo-American Struggle for Command</h3>
<p>Since arriving in New Delhi two weeks ago, Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia Lord Mountbatten, in addition to appointing his chief of staff and other personnel, has convened military conferences with military experts in the region daily. He also traveled to Chongqing to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, but the purpose was merely for publicity. A Berlin newspaper published an article on the 24th titled "Mountbatten's Operations and Possibilities," the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Mountbatten's Shadow</p>
<p>Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia, Lord Mountbatten, has been in office for nearly two months, and only recently arrived in New Delhi. Upon arrival, he immediately convened military conferences with the heads of the army, navy, and air force in the region daily. However, Commander of the Southwest Pacific Area General MacArthur neither accepted the invitation to attend nor sent a representative. Furthermore, Chongqing did not send a representative. It can be inferred that the command scope of Churchill's newly appointed "military genius" Mountbatten does not extend to the entire East Asian Allied forces. Moreover, the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which is necessary for the Allied operations against Japan, is naturally under the command of its commander, Admiral Nimitz, and is unwilling to be under Mountbatten's command. Therefore, the Allied operations in East Asia are actually commanded by MacArthur, Chiang Kai-shek, Nimitz, and Mountbatten. The appointment of Mountbatten as Supreme Commander, so painstakingly decided at the Quebec Conference, has no practical significance whatsoever. From this, it can be seen that there is a deep and insurmountable divide between the British and American armies. The Anglo-American Allied plan for attacking Japan is extremely chaotic in terms of command.</p>
<p>The Overall Situation in Four Theaters</p>
<p>Secondly, the Anglo-American forces have four bases for attacking Japan: the Aleutian Islands, mainland China, the Southwest Pacific, and eastern India. These battle lines span tropical regions and areas near the Arctic Circle. The regions are vast, and replenishment becomes a problem first in the Burma campaign and the South Pacific campaign. Furthermore, operations in the Aleutian Islands are only possible for two months in the summer, and operations in the Burmese border area are impossible during the rainy season. Due to these climatic constraints, the Anglo-American desire for a simultaneous offensive on all fronts is absolutely impossible. The Anglo-Americans greatly overestimate Chongqing's strength, harboring the dream of using it as a base to bomb the Japanese mainland in the future. However, the Chongqing forces, which recently launched counter-offensives in Shandong and Zhejiang provinces, were soon defeated by the Japanese army. This fact proves that the Chongqing forces cannot be considered a strong ally of the Anglo-Americans today. To effectively promote the Chongqing forces, it is necessary to drive the Japanese army out of Burma and secure the supply line to Chongqing. But that is impossible today.</p>
<p>Among the aforementioned four battle lines, the only one actively engaged today is the Southwest Pacific front commanded by MacArthur. This has been ongoing for over a year and has no direct connection to the Quebec Conference. Just how fiercely MacArthur's forces are fighting in this area can be seen by the fact that, since the counter-offensive began on Guadalcanal Island last August, it has been over a year, and to this day, the number of landing sites they have secured can be counted on one's fingers. In the Guadalcanal landing battle alone, the Allied forces suffered tens of thousands of casualties, and the Australian army suffered extremely heavy losses in the Buna area. It took 23 days to cover the short distance from the Moresby airfield to Buna. The forest battle of Salamaua took six weeks and cost the lives of 5,000 Australian soldiers. These are all facts that speak louder than words. Furthermore, the Japanese army skillfully retreats and ambushes the enemy at another location, so MacArthur's battles are extremely difficult. On the other hand, on the Burmese front, chastened by the disastrous defeats of April and May this year, they dare not act rashly.</p>
<p>The Anglo-American Navy Will Face Crisis</p>
<p>London believes that strong naval support is indispensable in the Burmese campaign. Since the surrender of the Italian navy, the British Mediterranean Fleet has been able to transfer a sizable fleet to the Far East, but it is still unable to independently confront the Japanese navy. For the Southwest Pacific operation, the U.S. Navy constantly hopes that the British fleet will be relocated to the Far East. From this fact, one can see the painful situation of the U.S. Navy since the Pearl Harbor attack. As for the main force of the Japanese Navy, it remains intact to this day. With the best training in the world and backed by the Japanese people with their vigorous fighting spirit, the Japanese Navy's foundation is stable and unshakable. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox once said that he could subjugate Japan in three months if war were declared. But in these two years, Knox has learned many lessons and now even says that the Anglo-American navy is in danger of being annihilated by the Japanese navy. Knox clearly understands that the Anglo-American offensive against Japan will require an unexpectedly enormous sacrifice. Knox's anxiety now casts a shadow on Mountbatten's operational plans.

<h3>Special Police Division of the First Bureau Renamed Special Higher Division</h3>
<p>The First Police Bureau had an existing Special Police Division, but after the merger, the name "Special Police Division" was abolished and renamed the "Special Higher Division." The director of the division is still Wu Maomao, and the deputy directors are Yao Yunbo and Kin Anjo. In addition to Matsumoto Goro and Zhao Xuantang serving as director and deputy director of the General Affairs Division, respectively, Shen Jingan has also been appointed as deputy director. Xue Zhiliang is the director of the Inspection Division, and Tabata Minoru is the deputy director. He Qisheng is the deputy director of the Accounting Section of the General Affairs Division, and Lan Yisu is the assistant. According to this bureau's adjustment, one or two deputy directors and section chiefs have been added to each division and section to strengthen the structure and complete sound police affairs.</p>

<h3>Impressions of Traveling North with the Inspection Group to Manchukuo</h3>
<p>— Huang Wan</p>
<p>The Propaganda Department organized a Chinese journalist inspection group to Manchukuo last month, gathering reporters from newspapers in Beijing, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Anhui, and other places, a group of seven people, who arrived safely in Beijing and Shanghai a few days ago. I was honored to participate on behalf of this newspaper and also returned to Shanghai yesterday. I will briefly record my impressions of this trip as follows:</p>
<p>Warm Climate in the North</p>
<p>"I haven't traveled by train for six years. This time, I was sent to Manchukuo for sightseeing, traveling with an eye disease. Fortunately, the climate in the north is warm this winter, and I didn't feel cold. I only stayed in Manchukuo for half a month, passing through cities such as Xinjing, Jilin, Qiqihar, Fengtian, and Anshan, with the shortest stay of four hours and the longest of four days in each place. The daily itinerary was arranged early, a superficial observation, with very few opportunities for individual browsing. Moreover, my eye disease and foot problems made it difficult to walk. If I said I understood Manchukuo, it would be a lie. But I can't say that this trip left me with no impressions at all. Our first impression upon arriving in Manchukuo was the spirit of hard work and struggle shared by the government and the people, which gave it the atmosphere of an emerging country. Wherever we went, we were warmly welcomed and entertained by the authorities and the literary and artistic circles. We were also grateful to Mr. Luo Zhongliang, a special affairs officer of the Information Department, who guided us all the way, allowing us to sincerely interact with various circles and increase our knowledge. The feeling of loving their [Manchukuo's] prosperity is becoming increasingly universal.</p>
<p>The Whole Country is Advancing</p>
<p>We witnessed the real situation of Manchukuo after eleven years: (1) The security of peace; (2) The reform of domestic affairs; (3) The integrity of officials; (4) The improvement of education; (5) The development of industry; (6) The revitalization of crafts. Administrative affairs are concentrated in the General Affairs Office, practicing a wartime system that is unified and effective. From top to bottom, everyone is working hard for nation-building. The atmosphere of harmony is very strong, which coincides with the hard-working spirit of the Chinese people. Everywhere, we experienced the diligence and hard work of the people of Manchukuo, which was astounding. Manchukuo has its own methods for solving problems. Daily necessities are fairly distributed by the government, and there is no black market for prices. They are consistently hoping that domestic production will be sufficient to meet the consumption of the entire nation. Because of the shortage of food, there are certain restrictions on people's diet. Civil servants eat barley and glutinous rice. Restaurants also have fixed hours, do not sell alcohol at noon, and only have one slice of bread and a bowl of coarse rice for each person at 4 pm. No refills are allowed. Generally, people wear coordinated clothes, put on a brocade belt, and that is considered formal wear. Women also mostly wear short, elegant, and simple clothes, with no extravagant phenomena such as perms or high heels. Wearing luxurious clothes would be despised.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Prices</p>
<p>Under the rationing system, the poor and rich receive the same amount. Rice: 4 kilograms for children, 9 kilograms for those aged 11 to 25, 8 kilograms for those aged 26 to 40, and 7 kilograms for those aged 40 to 60. The rationed prices are quite low. In Manchukuo currency, sorghum is 9 fen per jin, first-class flour is 11.6 yuan per bag, salt is 1.5 jiao per jin, sugar is 4 jiao per jin, a large bundle of matches is 6 jiao, and Crane brand cigarettes are 1.8 jiao each. Leather for cattle is replaced with horsehide and pigskin, and wool is replaced with hemp. Coffee and milk are all replaced with substitutes. Hotels save on water, electricity, and fuel. Washing starts at 5 am. Those with families are not allowed to take long showers. During the day, horse-drawn carriages are used instead of rickshaws, along with buses and streetcars. At night, people have to walk.</p>
<p>Xinjing, a Modern City</p>
<p>The total population of Manchukuo is currently 43 million, with Han and Manchu people making up the majority. The writing, language, customs, and habits are all Chinese. They adopt a politics of benevolence, respect sacred teachings, and promote the inherent civilization of the East. Wangdao academies are established in each province to cultivate nation-building talents. Touring the entire city of Xinjing, after eleven years of construction, it has now grown into a modern city. There are many facilities that our country can learn from. Unfortunately, time was pressing, and what I saw was limited to eastern Manchukuo. Fortunately, I received photographs and reference materials from various people. When I have time in the future, I will write separate notes to share with my countrymen.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's "Scholarship Aid Honor Certificate": Method of Sale Determined</h3>
<p>This newspaper, to raise scholarship aid, has been staging plays for a long time. The first performance was the famous play "Gone with the Wind," whose plot was subtle and tortuous and whose acting was so vivid and lifelike that it caused a sensation throughout Shanghai, with every performance sold out. In response to the requests of enthusiastic people from all walks of life, it has been decided to reserve the best seats for the Saturday and Sunday matinees (2:30 PM) and the Sunday evening performance (8:00 PM) and sell "Scholarship Aid Honor Certificates" for 50 yuan each. Each certificate sells for 150 yuan (including 50 yuan for the ticket and 100 yuan for a charitable donation to the scholarship fund). Those who wish to purchase certificates should contact the social service department of this newspaper between 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM from Monday to Friday. Telephone 93248. The seats will be assigned immediately, and the names of the certificate holders will be published in this newspaper in succession to show their enthusiasm. Watching famous plays and helping students at the same time is a win-win situation. Why not do it?</p>
<h3>Household Flour Distribution in Huxi Ends Today</h3>
<p>The Hu Fourth District Office, in order to ensure the smooth distribution of grain in the next period, has ended the distribution of the 25th period of household rice yesterday. The distribution of the current (18th) period of household flour is also scheduled to end today. It will be invalid if overdue.</p>
<h3>Cutting Noodle Industry Requests Crackdown: Rice Shops Selling Cutting Noodles</h3>
<p>In this city, there are approximately over one thousand merchants dealing in fragrant cutting noodles. Recently, due to the inability to obtain sufficient raw materials (wheat flour), the industry has been greatly affected. However, the entire industry, recognizing that cutting noodles are also a staple food for citizens and cannot be interrupted even for a day, have been painfully purchasing raw materials on the black market to continue production to meet market demand. Yesterday, according to the responsible person of the industry association, after various rice shops successively began to sell cutting noodles concurrently, ostensibly for the convenience of citizens easily cooking flour noodles, each of these rice shops has different methods, deducting the amount, and hoping to obtain undue profits. Without "Cutting Noodle Business Licenses," they are openly selling concurrently, which is clearly violating the authorities' regulations. Conversely, each member of our industry, due to legal constraints and consideration for the citizens' livelihoods, cannot but reluctantly manage the business, and now we are suffering a serious threat. If we are once forced to shut down, the livelihoods of thousands of workers will be unimaginable. Therefore, we specifically submit a petition to the authorities to effectively crack down on rice shops concurrently selling cutting noodles.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Raw Materials for Various Cotton Textile Factories To Be Rationed; Factories Are Preparing to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the purchase of yarn and cloth, various cotton textile factories in the Shanghai area, such as cotton cloth, woolen cloth, blankets, socks, and other cotton products, have successively temporarily suspended operations. The measures for centralized allocation of cotton products and the regulations for the production and allocation of cotton products have been approved by the Materials Control Review Committee. The raw cotton yarn needed by various cotton textile factories will be allocated by the authorities according to law. Therefore, recently, various factories have already prepared to resume operations. As soon as the cotton yarn allocation is implemented, they will process and manufacture products to meet the market demand.</p>
<h3>Youth City Corps: Second Symposium</h3>
<p>The "Sino-Japanese Alliance" symposium, organized by the Shanghai City Corps of the Chinese Youth League, held its second session yesterday at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA Auditorium in the Eighth District. The school corps representatives attending included National Chiao Tung University, Qingnian Middle School, Zhengfeng Middle School, Huizhong Middle School, Zhengxing Girls' Middle School, China Middle School, St. Francis Middle School, Qilu Middle School, Guangxia Middle School, Municipal No. 2 Middle School, Pudong Middle School, Nanyang Middle School, and the Shanghai Youth Association, with over 300 member representatives from the district. Leading officials attending to provide guidance included Liu Yangshan, Deputy Director-General of the Lian Guo Bu, Xi Peiwen, Deputy Commander of the City Corps, Ma Jinren, Secretary of the City Education and Youth Bureau, Fang Qian, Section Chief of the City Propaganda Department, etc. After Deputy Commander Xi, the chairman, reported the significance of the symposium, he read Director-General Liu's instructions. Subsequently, based on the regulations, discussions began on: Issues concerning the Sino-Japanese Alliance and overall peace; Issues concerning the New National Movement in this city; Issues concerning the organization and training of the Youth League in this city. Representatives from various school corps raised opinions and numerous relevant practical issues. After two hours of heated discussion, the results obtained were very satisfactory. It is also learned that the symposium will continue to be held at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th at the auditorium of the Old Shanghai Fourth Police Station.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service Held Solemnly Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Memorial Service held by the Greater East Asia Buddhist Federation was held at the Jade Buddha Temple on Binlang Road yesterday. The service will last for seven days, until the 9th of this month. Major Chinese and Japanese Buddhist masters from the city will attend the temple to chant sutras. It officially began at 10:00 AM. Chairman Xu Qianlin, Vice Chairman Ogawara Akizane, the Presidium Zhu Zhengdong, etc., all attended and presided. All the dancers and the two Mongolian Living Buddhas, Losang Basang, began the prayer ceremony, led by Grand President Otani Kozui to comfort the spirits. In the afternoon, Japanese Army and Navy officers also went to comfort and worship, along with Wang Wuquan, President of the Zhejiang Branch, Vice President Kabe Ho, committee member Zhang Wenmo, etc., and Chinese and Japanese officials jointly offered sacrifices. The situation on the first day was solemn and grand, and the number of pilgrims from all walks of life was also very enthusiastic. The Association specially announced that, in order to show the solemnity of the event, anyone coming to the service should not bring any items inside. Even incense, candles, and paper money will be prepared and sold by the Association. Those who wish to visit the service during the event period must purchase tickets for entry, with a ticket price of 20 yuan per person. The antique and cultural exhibition displayed in the hall also requires the purchase of separate tickets for entry. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically participate, praying together for lasting world peace and comforting the spirits of the Chinese and Japanese soldiers who died in battle. It is also reported that Great Master Uejo Jikyo will expound Buddhist teachings on Shanghai Radio Station from 7:00 AM to 7:30 AM on the 4th of this month.

<h3>Residence Certificates of Deceased Persons Should Be Returned Immediately</h3>
<p>In order to ensure local security in all districts under its jurisdiction, the Second Cotton Inspection Bureau of this city has implemented the issuance of residence certificates under orders. Since its implementation, the public has generally prepared residence certificates. As a result, it is particularly difficult for villains to mix in. However, it has been found that when the person using the residence certificate dies, their relatives and children often do not immediately return the certificate, causing it to be lost into the hands of bad people, who replace the photo and use it, which is a serious violation of discipline. Therefore, the Bureau specifically ordered its subordinate branch bureaus and district police bureaus to strictly check residence certificates and, more strictly, to pursue and recover them after the death of the people, so as to eliminate evil.</p>

<p>Economic Circle Commentary</p>
<h3>Checking Commercial Fitness</h3>
<p>The structure of a commercial organization is like the human body. It is necessary to check it from time to time to ensure its soundness. The items to be checked all have detailed regulations. For example, what is the weight? How is the heart activity? What is the blood pressure? How is the diet and digestion? These are all the guidelines that must be followed by those who examine the human body. The principles for checking commercial organizations are also the same; What is the capital? How is the operation? How much profit? What is the trading form? All of these are sufficient to show whether a commercial organization is normal or sound.</p>
<p>However, the doctor examines the body, and the individual maintains it. After the doctor's examination, it is necessary for the individual to set the rules to restrain the body and mind, in order to maintain the health of the body; Commercial organizations are also the same. For example, the recent self-discipline of banks, the repricing of various industries, the trading rules of the market, and the business rules of the stock exchange are all like the rules for individuals to restrain their body and mind. Now, let's take the details of the stock exchange industry as an example. The punishment regulations it stipulates cannot be said to be not strict. Point 7: "Spreading false rumors and using fraudulent transactions to shake the market," and Point 9: "Violating general commercial ethics and being recognized as losing credibility among the brokers of the exchange," directly reflect the two topics "Economic Toxins" and "Merchant Morality" discussed in this column before. The main purpose of its exhaustible operational malpractices is exactly what we have said, that is, after the stock exchange resumes formal trading, we must pay attention to how to prevent speculation and stabilize prices at any time, so as to make the stock market tend to the right track. Only then will the China Merchants Stock Exchange have a sound commercial fitness!</p>

<h3>Rumor of Stock Exchange Auction Postponed Again</h3>
<p>Thirty-one brokers registered; forty-six stocks for trading.</p>
<p>The opening date of the China Merchants Stock Exchange, which is attracting the attention and concern of the entire city's financial circles, was once decided to be the beginning of the month for trial operation, but it was eventually postponed due to some reason. In addition to the telephone installation not yet being fully in place, procedural adjustments are also required for this postponement. The official opening date is rumored to be later, perhaps postponed to the 15th. As for the number of brokers, although it is set at 200, due to the high cost of brokers, only the first 19 and the second 12 have been completely decided, totaling 31. In addition, the number of Chinese stocks for trading has been set at 46, including 4 cultural stocks, 3 financial stocks, 2 investment stocks, 22 textile stocks, 2 real estate stocks, 3 department store stocks, 4 new drug stocks, and 6 industrial stocks.</p>
<h3>170+ New or Expanded Banks and Financial Institutions in This City in Four Months</h3>
<p>Previously, the Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that new financial institutions in Shanghai have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain in recent years, including general banks and financial institutions with insufficient capital and unsound organization, feared that this would affect the entire finance under this wartime situation. In order to implement the management of financial institutions, it promulgated new measures to address the reorganization of general small financial institutions (such as banks and financial institutions), ordering the banking and financial industries to increase the amount of capital within six months from July 1st of this year. The capital of banks and financial institutions must be increased to at least 6 million yuan. According to the provisions of the Company Law (because financial institutions have been ordered to change to a limited company organization), one-half of the amount, that is, 3 million yuan, must be collected first before they can operate. Ordinary commercial banks engaged in agency business must have a minimum fee of 5 million yuan, of which 3 million yuan is the capital of the banking department and 1 million yuan is the capital of the trust department. If financial institutions do not increase their capital according to the amount within six months of receiving the order, they will be ordered to merge or close. It is now known that after receiving the order, various financial institutions have gathered to increase their capital. Up to now, 78 banks have increased their capital, and more than 100 financial institutions have done so. About 3% of the financial institutions are still preparing to increase their capital. It is expected that all financial institutions will be able to complete the increase in capital by the end of December.</p>
<p>Statistics on New Financial Institutions in This City</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance has implemented the management of financial institution operations, the restrictions on new banks and financial institutions have been very strict. It is now known that from three years ago to the end of July this year, the statistics on new financial institutions in this city are as follows: 194 new banks and 51 new branch banks; 136 financial institutions.</p>
<h3>National Savings Week Ends in Nanjing with Excellent Results</h3>

<h3>The Reality of Apprentice Life in Shenzhuang</h3>
<p>— Ying Shi</p>
<p>I am an apprentice living in a Shenzhuang shop on the third floor. I am only seventeen years old this year. All day long, I hide in a room that is not exposed to sunlight all year round, doing mechanical slave work. One year, two years, three years, the giant wheel of time keeps moving forward, and my work is always so stereotyped, humble, and has never changed. After the suspension of export vessels on December 8th, the staff in the store either resigned or stopped working. Invisibility adds to the burden of work. I am responsible for everything from writing letters and calculating accounts, going to and from banks, to cooking and cooking, sweeping the floor, and everything else. In my spare time, I have to hold the children and squeeze the limited-price goods. I am really overwhelmed.</p>
<p>As for the salary? It is almost negligible. Although the price of rice has jumped from 10 yuan per load to nearly 20 yuan per load today, my monthly salary is still stuck at 20 yuan. How can this meager 20 yuan be used? I have tried my best to tighten my daily expenses, but fixed expenses such as haircuts, laundry, bathing, shoes, and socks, which are inevitable every month, always put pressure on me on a regular basis. As a result, I still have to borrow money.</p>
<p>However, how many relatives and friends are willing to lend you money when you are a young man who has just entered society? And—and unfortunately, it has to be repaid. Even if you lend it to you once, twice, or even three times, if you have no money to pay it back, will you be willing to lend it to you in the future? Ah! I absolutely dare not use reason to imagine what will happen in the future.</p>
<p>In this Shanghai city where merchants gather, there must be tens of millions of apprentices in the same situation as me, struggling with their own destiny in desperation, and eager for society to speak out for them!</p>
<p>Every time I see in the newspapers about raising donations for refugees and appealing for elementary school teachers, have we, this army of apprentices who have been trampled on by feudal ideas for many years, been forgotten by society? No, no, absolutely not. In this modern century where you are singing about human equality, there must be many people with new ideas who are calling for us. At the same time, I also hope that all walks of life will respond and use appropriate methods to adjust our lives.</p>

<h3>Implementation of the "Decisive Battle for Life" in North China</h3>
<p>— Beiyan</p>
<p>The war is gradually entering its final stage, and adjusting wartime life is a pressing matter. In the last ten days of the new construction implementation work, the North China authorities held a "Decisive Battle for Life" campaign to promote new construction in North China, aiming to make the public understand the relationship between daily life and the war. This campaign started on the 21st of this month. Chairman Wang even telegraphed to the chief officials of the four provinces and three municipalities in North China, instructing them to prohibit banquets and drinking during the "Decisive Battle for Life" campaign, not to buy any non-essential items, and for public officials to avoid taking cars to and from work unless absolutely necessary. Chief Zhao of the Information Bureau also gave a moving speech on the radio for this campaign. The newspaper editorials also used this as a topic to express their high opinions. The importance of the "Decisive Battle for Life" campaign can be imagined.</p>
<p>Good Air Defense Results</p>
<p>Because of the epidemic prevention, Beijing temporarily suspended the long-prepared air defense exercise and let other cities in North China hold it. Now that the epidemic prevention has become a thing of the past, the news of the complete removal of the epidemic prevention measures has been published in the newspaper on the 22nd, and the epidemic prevention headquarters was officially dissolved on the 21st. As a result, the atmosphere of air defense has come again. The "New Beijing Daily" and "Mass Daily" also held an air defense speech contest to permeate the public with air defense ideas. There were as many as 18 applicants, and the first prize winner, Chen Xiaoshan, even received a bonus of 100 yuan. On the other hand, the police defense corps of the old capital also held a training review of the air defense groups, starting from the 22nd. On the morning of the first day, the first session of the first district was reviewed by Chen Xiong, a standing member of the corps headquarters, and Liu Julien, a standing member. The location was Wangfujing Street. In the afternoon, senior member Sun Yunzhang and Yamashita reviewed the third detachment of the third district in the east, located at Dongsi North Street. The review focused on the protection team members' fixed monitoring actions, fire prevention and firefighting actions, rescue actions, avoidance, and prone positions. It is said that "the results were all good." On the second day, the sixth district was reviewed in the morning and the fifth district in the afternoon. Needless to say, the results were also good. The newspaper also carried the news that the Municipal Government regularly holds air defense film festivals. It is said that this conference will be held on the 29th and 30th at the Central Zhenguang two film studios. In addition to the North China Film Company providing "films related to air defense knowledge such as Ape Sanji's Air Defense Battle and Air Defense Big Pear Incendiary Bomb", various agencies will also send people to give speeches.</p>
<p>Enemy Property Management Committee Established</p>
<p>Since the Nanjing National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, most of the British and American enemy properties in China that were confiscated by Japan have been returned by Japan to the Nanjing National Government for management. The enemy properties in North China will be managed by the North China authorities, which have decided to organize the North China Enemy Property Management Committee. The chairman is Wang Shi, the superintendent of the Ministry of Finance. The other standing committee members are Zhang Zhongzhi, the director of political affairs of the Political Affairs Committee, Zhu Shuyuan, the director of the Secretariat, and the directors of various General Offices. This committee has been prepared recently, and the inaugural meeting was held at the Ministry of Finance on the 18th of this month. The cultural institutions of British and American enemy properties in Beijing are mostly used by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. In addition to housing soldiers, Yenching University in the suburbs also runs a North China Comprehensive Survey and Research Institute. The Xiehe Hospital is used to house troops. Other primary and secondary schools, such as Jiao Ying Baiman, have been changed to municipal schools, and hospitals such as Daoji Tongren have also been changed to municipal hospitals. As for churches and YMCA, they continue to exist, and are either managed by the North China Christian Church.</p>
<p>Electricity Saving Campaign</p>
<p>Recently, people in Beijing often encounter the phenomenon of sudden dimming of electric lights when going out at night. According to the investigation, this is an intentional power-saving method by the electric light company, which divides the entire city into several districts and takes turns to dim the lights and cut off the current for 20 minutes. It can be seen that saving electricity has become a necessary measure in wartime North China. Not only are electric lights being limited, but recently the newspaper also published news about saving telephone resources in various parts of North China. The North China Telephone Company decided to control and recover all non-urgent and unused telephones in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Xuzhou, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Tangshan, Tanggu, and Zhifu from October 1st to December 31st for two months. After the recovery, the company will pay "600 yuan for the first class, 600 yuan for the second class, 450 yuan for the third class, 450 yuan for the fourth class, 450 yuan for the fifth class, and 300 yuan for the sixth class" as compensation. This is really a very proper method. On the other hand, the North China Electric Power Company has also restricted users from adding electric lights or sockets since September 1st. Without the company's permission, they are not allowed to do so privately. At the same time, the electricity system has been changed, and the fees for exceeding a certain amount of electricity are particularly expensive. Chinese people have never known how to cherish electricity. This is not only a necessary measure during wartime, but it can also train Chinese people to cherish motive power.</p>
<p>Solving the Coal and Oil Shortage</p>
<p>The coal and oil shortage in Beijing is now getting worse. Coal briquettes have risen to the level of four yuan of joint currency per 100 jin. Along with the coal shortage, firewood has also risen sharply. The firewood brought by the villagers in the streets has risen to 32 yuan per 100 jin. The coal shortage in North China, which is located in the coal-producing area, can be said to be a bit inexplicable, but the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants is at least one of the reasons. Zong Ji, the director of the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, believes that this phenomenon of "rising prices without end" is very harmful to the general public, and has decided to send personnel to investigate the wrinkled prices and the inventory of coal merchants, and on the 19th, he issued a statement to the coal merchants: "They should adhere to the concept of self-discipline and sell to the city at fair prices, and must not engage in hoarding and speculation. Once discovered or reported by the public, they will be severely punished without leniency." As for the oil shortage, its severity is unimaginable. All oil mills have stopped making oil. Now, except for small peddlers selling zero oil, all oil shops do not sell oil. Occasionally, in black market transactions, peanut oil is sold for more than ten yuan per catty. The general public has no way, so they go to food stores to buy raw vegetable oil instead, so raw vegetable oil has also risen from about four yuan per catty to around ten yuan. However, now even raw vegetable oil is not easy to buy. Under this situation, the Beijing Municipal Materials Price Handling Committee specially convened the relevant personnel of the Beijing Sesame Oil Industry Association and the Oil Shop Industry Association on the 22nd of this month to discuss ways to solve the oil shortage, and at the same time began to investigate the sources and supply of oil from the oil shop industry and sesame oil industry associations.

<h3>The Origin of the Cigarette Black Market</h3>
<p>— Gong Bing</p>
<p>Since the spring of this year, the China Tobacco Distribution Association has uniformly distributed cigarettes (including products from Yizhong, Zhonghua, and Huashang factories) to small retailers at a limited price. Small retailers are divided into four levels: A, B, C, and D. The distribution volume is one to fourty eight (for example, if the D level is 1,000 yuan, then the A level is 8,000 yuan). The distribution period for the first phase was March 20th of this spring, and it has now reached the fifteenth phase, with an average of about two distributions per month. The distribution quantity for the D level has always been around 2,000 yuan per period (C level 4,001 yuan, B level 8,000 yuan, A level 11,600 yuan). The legal profit is stipulated as 15%, and it was increased to 20% from the thirteenth phase.</p>
<p>My shop is in the lowest level of cigarette shops, and we get about 4,000 yuan of cigarettes per month. The stipulated legal profit is 800 yuan (only 600 yuan before the thirteenth phase). It is found that cigarette shops mainly sell cigarettes, and their trade accounts for more than 80% of the turnover (my shop specializes in selling rolled cigarettes and matches). May I ask if a cigarette shop can cover its expenses by relying only on this so-called main business of 800 yuan gross profit per month? If you remove the heavy taxes (including business tax, license tax, income tax, Economic Bureau registration fee, license fee, and trade association membership fee), I am afraid that even the water, electricity, and rent cannot be paid, let alone food and salaries. Since small shops cannot cover their expenses (and large shops with A-level legal profits can only earn 6,400 yuan per month), they have to take the risk of doing business on the black market to survive (there is no question of profiting). Therefore, I think that while the authorities should vigorously crack down on the black market, the legal profits of small retailers should also be reviewed slightly to ensure that they can maintain a minimum level of expenditure.</p>
<p>The price of cigarettes has more than doubled since the thirteenth phase. In theory, the legal profits of small retailers can be increased by more than double in this case. However, in fact, this is not the case. The amount of cigarettes distributed after the price increase has suddenly decreased by more than half, so that the legal profit remains the same as before, without any increase. Moreover, after the price increase, the number of miscellaneous brands of cigarettes has increased, accounting for almost 80 to 90% of the total (there were no Yizhong cigarettes in the fourteenth phase, and only two boxes of British Old Knife in the fifteenth and sixteenth phases). These miscellaneous brands of cigarettes are high in price and of poor quality, making them very difficult to sell (such as Gaoerfu, Liming, Black Girl, Haolaixi, Fayuaner, etc.), and they must be sold at a loss. Because miscellaneous brands of cigarettes have to be sold at a loss, the prices of cigarettes produced by the major brands have to be raised or bundled to make up for it. This fact is obvious to everyone and cannot be denied.</p>
<p>This is the basis of the black market from the perspective of small retailers. Furthermore, the real reason for the black market is that the supply and demand are not balanced (that is, demand is greater than supply). Cigarettes are not essential for life. I think that the price of cigarettes can be continuously increased according to the black market price to reduce the demand. If the demand decreases, the supply and demand will be balanced. If the supply and demand are balanced, the black market will naturally disappear. Therefore, to completely eliminate the cigarette black market, it is necessary to adopt the price increase method. The excess profits obtained by cigarette factories can be used for public welfare purposes. Cigarettes are consumer goods. Having them is not too much, and not having them is not too little. Increasing the price will not affect the livelihood of ordinary people (and the profits from the cigarette price increase can be used to subsidize the price of hardship rice, which will lower the price of household rice, benefiting ordinary people immeasurably). If the quantity distributed to small retailers does not decrease after the price increase, the legal profits can be increased proportionally. At the same time, if miscellaneous brands are not used to make up the numbers, small retailers can maintain their expenses and will naturally not be happy to sell on the black market illegally.</p>
<p>However, one thing should also be noted, that is, after the price of cigarettes continues to rise, if it exceeds the black market price and cannot be sold, the unsold cigarettes can be taken back at the original price within the stipulated time limit to avoid losses for small retailers. At the same time, it is also necessary to cancel the cigarette distribution to South goods stores, department stores, and oil and wine shops, and ensure that the distribution quantity of real cigarette shops is increased, so that they can obtain more legal profits and implement the principle of using cigarette shops to support cigarette shops. This is what is hoped for from the distribution association. If the above points can be achieved, it will be a fundamental solution to eradicate the black market. Now I summarize it as follows: Continuously increase the limited price, reduce consumption, and balance supply and demand. Do not reduce the distribution quantity or use miscellaneous brands of cigarettes to make up the numbers, so that small retailers can increase their legal profits. If the limited price is too high and small retailers cannot sell all of them, the association will still take back the unsold portion at the original price within a reasonable time limit. Cancel the cigarette distribution to non-cigarette shops to increase the distribution quantity of cigarette shops. (End)</p>

<h3>Ranked First But Did Not Apply for Scholarship</h3>
<p>Although my father is noble and self-respecting, I can't help but cry out</p>
<p>I am a poor elementary school student studying at the Sapo Sai Elementary School in the Eighth District. I have been there for three years. Fortunately, I ranked first in the last semester of last year and the first semester of this year. Now I am in the fifth grade, but I have never received a scholarship or loan. I see that my family is in difficulty. My father is a professor at ×× University, and his monthly income is less than 1,000 yuan. He can't find a part-time job, and he has to support my mother, my two sisters, and me. My brother is still asking for money from home from time to time. It really makes my father feel desperate, but my father's stubborn nature always suffers in silence and doesn't try to get a loan for me. I think what kind of society is this? My father's nobility is just suffering. Next door, there is a family with two concubines who seem to be quite wealthy, but two of their sons have received loans, which makes me feel that there will be no good days for high-ranking people, and I will have no books to read. I see that my clothes are not warm enough this winter, and my schooling next year has become a problem. I want to take first place every semester, but taking first place can't solve the family's difficulties. So I wrote this letter to your newspaper for publication. I ask to be able to continue studying in the future, and I ask to be able to get some loans in the future. Can't society give me some sympathy? Student Wu Shaohua, 12 years old (Correspondence Address: No. 5, Si Hu, Ximen Road)</p>
<h3>Fuyou Orphanage Donates Good Books</h3>

<h3>Deaf Person Seeking Employment</h3>
<p>Ming Sheng, 38 years old, is from Pinghu, Zhejiang. He graduated from the Department of Arts of St. John's University. He once served as the director of the post and telecommunications office and an English translator and typist at Wantai Foreign Company for more than 11 years. He was laid off after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. He is proficient in English translation, typing, small regular script, and abacus, and is also good at managing documents, advertisements, stationery, postal and telecommunications, and all general office work. (He has a wife and three young children) He relies on Ming to make a living. He has been unemployed for a long time, and his economy is tight. His family lacks permanent property, and he has no hometown to return to. What is even more hateful is that he is hard of hearing in both ears, making it difficult to find a job. He has applied for many jobs, but none have been successful due to his deafness. He has no strength to bind a chicken and cannot run a small stall. Today, rice and firewood are expensive, and his livelihood is cut off. He is at a loss and waits to die. He thinks that there are many charitable and enthusiastic people in society who may pity his disability and give him a job to help him. (When I worked at Wantai Foreign Company, I had a hearing aid, so my work efficiency was not affected at all, and I can provide a guarantee). Xu Mingsheng informs.

<h3>By Mail</h3>
<p>After Yang Sujun's article "The Imminent Wheat Production Increase Work" was published in the National Forum on October 26th, a reader, Mr. Lv Wenrui from the Chinese Alcohol Factory, inquired about the purchase place of Jinda 2905 wheat. Here is the author's reply:</p>
<p>The Tongde Agricultural Research Institute of the Chinese Science Society on Yale Road, Shanghai, recently purchased 10 tons of this wheat from the Nanjing Chinese Youth Workers' Association. You can inquire whether it can be distributed.</p>
<p>The Jiancun Seed Education Department attached to the Chinese Youth Workers' Association at No. 12, Embroidery Flower Lane, Nanjing, has a large number of this wheat seed. You can write to inquire.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Grain Department recently ordered a certain food production increase plan, and will centrally distribute the 2905 wheat after centralization. You can write to the Department's Production Increase Department to request it. If permission is granted, it will also be much more convenient in terms of delivery.</p>
