<p>社評</p>
<h3>日趨嚴重的公務員生活問題</h3>
<p>如果說一切國策實施之成敗，其最後的決定力量是在執行的人，——所謂「治人」，那麼對於實際執行國策的各級公務人員的生活，首先應當加以特別注意。因爲公務員生活之安定與否，無論直接間接，都要影響到他的實際工作的。而所謂公務員的生活，最値得注意的還是物質上的生活。具體的說，就是關於公務員的衣食住諸問題。諺云：「衣食足而後知榮辱」，如果每一公務員的物質生活，無法解決，那麼，狡黠者不免藉公務地位而營私，忠實者雖能克守節操，但家屬愁嘆之聲，時縈於耳，衣食薪火之慮，紛集於胸，欲求其專心奉公，實際上不易收獲良好的效能。那麼，現在一般公務員的生活，是否已經發生問題了呢？首先，我們以上海爲例，來看近年來生活指數之動向。據本年五月份出版的「上海經濟年鑑」上半年號所載，上海日僑生活必需品物價指數，如次：</p>
<p>民國二十五年總平均　一〇〇·〇〇</p>
<p>民國二十八年總平均　一五八·一四</p>
<p>民國三十年總平均　三三八·五九</p>
<p>三十二年一月總平均　四七八·八四</p>
<p>民國二十七年總平均　一二八·五九</p>
<p>民國二十九年總平均　二八二·〇七</p>
<p>民國三十一年總平均　四〇一·六〇</p>
<p>三十二年二月總平均　四九二·二二</p>
<p>國人薪水階級生活費指數之動向如次：</p>
<p>再看一般勞動者的生活指數，有如下表：（以民國二十五年冬月平均指數爲一〇〇，三十一年三月份以下爲中儲券計算之指數）</p>
<p>本年的生活指數，雖然尙無公開的數字可資依證，但就實際經騐，可知在舊曆年關以後，一般物價，已高漲自三分之一至二分一以上。自三月間撤消物資移動限制辦法以後，米價有顯著之低抑，肥皂價格亦有極大降落，然實際上一般日用物品，不僅未能隨之下跌，反有日趨上漲之事實，特別以衣料雜用品油類等所漲尤爲驚人。至最近以配給戶口麵粉之漲價一倍，以及其他公定價格如食油，公用事業如電車公共汽車收費，以及限價物品之價格提高，我們雖然看到若干公司商店賤價的廣告，按之實際一般人民生活必需品，較諸本年舊曆新年以後之漲價，至少又有三分之一以上的增漲。現在假定以一五口之家的生活費用，計（每日兩餐每餐每人吃三碗飯）</p>
<p>以上尙未將車馬費，衣着費。孩童雜費，敎育費，醫藥費，交際費，正當娛樂費，書報費，等正常生活所必需的費用計入，而且必須自己担任烹飪雜務。否則，雖有月薪三千元，恐怕實際上亦必不及民國廿五年月薪八十元的滿意吧！然而現在公務員中有那幾級的薪俸高達三千元呢？我們要請當局重視這個日趨嚴重的生活問題，戰時的刻苦，應母庸說，每一個公務人員都很明瞭，但同時，最低限度的生活，無論如何要充分給予維持。傳聞政府將實施實物俸給制，這自然是一個最適時宜的好制度，但一時似乎還未能實現。那麼，目前的問題的解決，唯一的是增加薪津，至於增加標準，第一，必須依據各地實際物價指數，作比例的增加。第二，注意工作的輕重性，工作的效能，奉公的精神。第三，注意公務人員子女過多家庭負担特重的，應特別補助；但同樣重要的，必須提高政治效率，一面增加待遇，一面就須實行「簡政」，不必要的駢枝機關必須裁撤，與合併，不會做事，不肯做事，做事不力，掛名拿錢的冗員閒缺，必須裁免。這樣，政府機關可以一面節省應節的浮費，而用之於應用的開支，滿足公務員的物質生活，俾增加行政效率，實在是戰時施政的主要原則。公務人員與民營事業機關職員的待遇，性質上微有不同，一般的說，政府機關如有必要支出時，可以量出爲入，而民營事業機關，祗能量入爲出。所以，公務員待遇的提高，比較容易着手，何况目前的事實，公務人員的待遇還不及民營事業機關職員的待遇呢？爲了提高行政效率，爲了貫澈戰時國策，不辭一再爲公務員呼籲改善生活。我們敢於重複的申說，日趨嚴重的公務生活問題，如不加以迅速和妥善的解決，那麼，對於政府一切良政的推行，實是　大阻力。</p>

<h3>日山本元帥國葬　汪院長舉行廣播</h3>

<h3>滿皇頒贈勳章</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　滿洲國皇帝陛下爲紀念日本故山本元帥生前偉勳，曾決定以滿最高勳章大勳位蘭花大綬章頒贈山本元帥。茲滿洲駐日大使王允卿氏，特於三日上午十一時偕同秘書室野間施政課長赴日海軍省訪問島田海相傳達勳章，並鄭重致弔辭。又該勳章常即送至水交社，供於故山本元帥靈前。</p>
<h3>菲島民衆誌哀</h3>
<p>馬尼拉三日中央社電</p>
<p>菲島行政長官伐爾加斯於三日下午頒發布告，大意謂五日爲日本故山本元帥舉行國葬之日，菲島各機關學校團體及住戶應均懸半旗誌哀。又全島民衆並須於上午十時五十分一齊默禱，又是日凡歌舞音樂等均一律停止，以示儆弔山本元御英靈之意。</p>
<h3>泰政府致弔辭</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　泰國駐日大使泰略克，三日下午帶同該國大使館陸海軍武官，訪問東條首相，傳達畢本總理於山本元帥國葬時所致之弔辭，弔辭內容略謂，値茲故，山本元帥於六月五日，即將舉行國葬之典禮，泰國政府，不勝哀悼，敬與大日本帝國官民同申哀悼之忱，並對大日本偉大精神之陣亡，表示惋惜。</p>
<h3>國府明令嘉獎　蘇北募解獻金</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　三十二年六月三日國府命令，據軍事委員會委員長蘇北行營參謀長富雙英秘書長掌收民電呈，爲政府參戰，萬民振奮，爰經組織蘇北各界擁護參戰委員會，募集國防獻金四十八萬元，已匯解財政部請鑒核等情，該參謀長等導率知方，該地民衆輸財衛國，忠義可風，洵堪嘉獎，著交行政院轉飭財政部核收，並由軍事委員會轉飭知照，此令。</p>
<h3>禁烟紀念日　粵蘇舉行紀念</h3>
<p>廣州三日中央社電　省黨部以六月三日爲禁烟紀念日，特決定是日派出宣傳隊四隊，分在市內繁盛馬路，宣傳英帝國主義，以鴉片禍毒我國之侵略野心，及林則徐禁烟之偉大事蹟，以喚起市民打倒英美之情緒云。</p>
<p>蘇州三日中央社電　三日爲六三拒毒紀念日，黨務辦事處新運指道特舉行六三拒毒紀念大會。參加者爲各機關及人民團體代表，並令知大光明戲院於上午放映萬世流芳影片，半價招待觀衆，以廣宣傳鴉片之流毒。</p>
<h3>華北各縣警備隊　改編爲保安隊</h3>
<p>北京三日中央社電　國民政府華北政委會前曾將治安强化運動總本部，與防共委員會合併，設立華北剿共委員會，朱深氏兼任該委員會委員長，同時於各地設立分會，以統一剿共組織。茲爲加强地方警備隊與中央之聯繫起見，今政委會常會復議決保安隊編成暫行規則，將各縣縣警備隊，予以改編强化，並改名爲保安隊，直受剿共委員會之指揮。該規則已決定，近即公布實施。此次各縣警備隊改編爲保安隊之要點，即爲統一指揮强化實力。蓋以前各縣警備隊乃歸各該省警務廳指揮統轄，因各省指揮之万策不同，所以省與省間之聯絡亦欠圓滑。爲補救此缺點，今特將總指揮權歸於剿共委員會。而由治安總署督辦齊變　氏任保安總司令，各省長任保安司令，各道尹任保安指揮，各縣長任縣保安隊長。由此則治安組織與行政組織已形一體化。按華北剿共委會自四月間成立後，即已展開積極工作。民衆武裝組織亦已逐漸整備。未來之華北治安其必日愈良好，實可期待也。</p>
<h3>鎭淸鄕公署發表　渝共火併眞相</h3>

<h3>鄧省長定期赴漢</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　江西省省長鄧祖禹氏以該省各項政務與湖北省關係至爲密切，爲求聯絡起見，特定於五日晨偕同財政廳長及經濟顧問由京飛漢。預定至漢躭留數日，即直接轉潯履新。日來正分向各方辭行，甚爲忙碌。</p>
<h3>蘇北各檢問所工作</h3>
<p>南通三日中央社電　蘇北地區淸鄉主任公署以本地區封鎖設施，業已全部完成，特電飭各特區公署曁封鎖管理所，於本月五日起，各大檢問所一律開始工作。</p>
<h3>專家評論　日軍在大陸作戰</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　此間專家對日軍在大陸方面作戰及渝方所受影響，表明見解如左：五月上旬日華中軍於洞庭湖附近至宜昌對　一帶，展開江南作戰後，已完全達到作戰目的，而收獲莫大戰果。結果渝軍棄屍三六〇〇〇，被俘五〇〇〇，實予渝抗戰陣營以極大打擊。本年日中國派遣軍之作戰，華中華北相互呼應，實極活潑。日軍自本年二月中旬至三月中旬之一月間，於華中蘇淮地區及洞庭湖北方地區，展開華中春季進攻作戰，擊滅渝軍「第百十八師」，「第八十九軍」，江北挺進軍及共產新四軍等。四月中旬復於華北晉冀豫省境方面，展開太行作戰，攻擊渝第二十四集團軍，並將共產第十八集團軍擊滅。五月中旬再於華中展開江南夏季進攻作戰，使渝第六戰區蒙極大打擊。以上三作戰即本年初日軍於中國大陸展開之主要作戰。自此等作戰覜之，即可明瞭擊減重慶作戰之特徵。緣本年初國府參戰及日本對華交還專管租界後，已使中日關係進入新階段。渝方已喪失抗戰目的，乃頓感動搖。此對渝軍各將領及第一綫士兵影響甚大。使彼等抗戰意識極度低下，俘虜及投降者日漸增加，其數額遠超過遺棄屍體之數。又脫離渝方抗戰陣營參加國府陣營者亦有激增之勢。華北唯一之渝直系軍第二十四集團軍長龐炳勳上將及孫殿英已率部下七萬餘參加國府陣營，渝方對此頗爲苦惱。同時國府軍自參戰以來，即協力日軍作戰，於各戰綫發揮高速度之戰鬥力，此點對國府貫澈政治力之助力甚大。如斯渝軍戰力减低，必將逐漸崩潰，其苦悶之愈形深刻，不難想像云。</p>
<h3>華中日軍　獲要塞砲十門</h3>
<p>漢口三日中央社電　日軍此次在華中方面展開之夏季進攻作戰中，長驅深入渝第六戰區要銜長陽偏岩等，會在該地一帶攻擊渝軍所築之堅固陣地，截獲要塞砲六門。又二十四日在宜昌對岸猛追渝軍第十八師之日軍部隊，亦在台山附近奪獲同型之要塞砲四門，並截獲砲彈甚夥。此項要塞砲當爲渝軍防備日軍之溯江作戰而設，但因日軍此次夏季進攻作戰，用兵極爲神速，致渝軍措手不及，該項要塞砲遂被日軍所獲。已將此項砲身卸下，運往某地。渝軍原即深感要塞砲不足，此次又喪失此項大砲十門，故其所受打擊極大。</p>
<h3>冀南日軍　圍攻渝共軍</h3>
<p>石門三日中央社電　冀南日軍各部隊於五月廿六日在冀省西南部大名南方之南台附近，圍攻共軍冀南軍區第一軍分區殘軍。至廿九日止，查明共軍遺屍六一四具，被俘一六八人，日軍並截獲重機槍一挺，步槍一八八架，手槍五十三架等。（又電）日軍各部隊目上月下旬以來，即繼續進剿冀省中部渝共軍殘部，某日軍部隊於上月廿二日拂曉，在王家莊圍攻渝共軍時，在共軍屍中，發現共軍冀中軍區第六軍分區副司令夏祖盛屍體，亦在其內</p>
<h3>日大政翼贊會　召開地方局長會議　東條總裁懇切致詞</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　東條首相兼翼贊會總裁，三日正午邀請翼贊會全國地方支部事務局長及壯年團長舉行會議，並招待午餐會，即席懇談一時許，席間東條首相並懇切致詞。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日大政翼贊會東條總裁，因該會事務總長後藤丈夫已昇任副總裁，故決起用貴族院議員丸山鶴吉爲事務總長，三日微得丸山氏同意後，即於是日正式發表。</p>
<h3>日翼贊壯年團舉行　全國團長會議</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日翼贊壯年團於三日晨在此間大政翼贊會總會會議室，舉行全國團長會議。開會後，首由團長後藤丈夫致訓詞，詳述該團運動之根本精神，在於明徹團體本義，集中國家總力，完成高度之總力戰體制，以集中確立大東亞共榮圈，並指出翼壯運動已渦準備時期，而到達展開眞運動之階級，故將以今夏爲期，積極展開活動。又闡明此項運動之基本原則：（一）爲組織該團同志之精銳主義，並實施一貫之人事，由訓練　更提高其水準。（二）爲百四十萬團員今後斷然挺身而起，推除種種障碍，努力完成本位使命。（三）爲實現該團全國組織之本質，團結全國團員，增强中央與地方之連繋，以期展開具體而妥協之全國運動等，要請呼應政府之斷然施策，以展開積極而果敢之國氏運動。</p>
<h3>中政會例會通過　中儲會發行兩獎券</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　中政會於三日上午九時舉行第一二四次會議，主席在兆銘，報吿事項略，討論事項，（一）主席交議，據行政院呈據財政部呈，爲最高國防會議，通過採辦軍需物資特別規定之原則，曁軍需物資統制及委託採辦暫行辦法，均與中央稅警學校及中央稅警總團所需之軍需物資有關，擬淮照案，援用一案，轉呈鑒核等情，請公決案，決議通過，送國府轉飭遵照。（一）主席交議，據政院呈據財部呈，爲中央儲備銀行轉據中央儲蓄會，呈擬舉辦特別儲蓄獎券及福利獎券附具章程條例草案呈核一案，轉陳鑒核頭情，除特別儲蓄獎券暫行章程，應准備案外，所呈福利獎券暫行條例草案請公決案，決議通過，福利獎券暫行條例，送國民政府公布之，交立法院備查。</p>

<p>（一）蘇聯的解散　國際共產黨，傳說是英美首腦者華府會談的結果之一。這是蘇聯和英美之政治的提携强化之一種姿態，而爲對軸心之有作用的宣傳。表面上國際共產黨雖告解散，但並不決定解散各國的共產黨，或放棄共產主義的世界革命方針。對各國共產黨的指導聯絡，因共產黨的從事秘密工作、將不致和以前有何變更。因而對中國共產黨的關係，亦將不致有大變化。對四北路綫的開發計劃。英美和蘇聯或許暫時已成立妥協。</p>
<p>（二）中國應付目前世界戰局的決意和信念，決勞力推進旣定方針，爲了和日本共同協力完成大東亞戰爭而向增强戰力之途邁進。不久之前，曾視察滿洲國及華北，更加感到增强生產，大陸經濟之有機的一體化之必要。滿洲國重工業方面的發達，極堪驚異，足資參考。關於華中與華北的一體化，在訪問北京時，也曾與中日首腦人士充分詳談，今後各方面的施策將一一見之實行，而根本問題應首先解決聯銀券和儲備券之通貨統一問題。對華北的食糧問題，正從華中急運麵粉，雜糧等物。全面協力救濟華北民生。民國三十二年度的華中華北物資交流計劃，業已商有成案，在商統會的統制下實施運營。至於上述交易差額之決算，決定在儲備銀行和聯銀之間設定若干億圓的信用貸款，預定不久即可和聯銀代表簽訂協定。</p>
<p>（三）白七月一日閉始向下半期決戰財政，預料約比上期增加約七·八成。現在正在趕編預算中。因渝軍部隊參加和平陣營日見加多，故軍事費相當增加。又因物價的騰貴，文武官員的增俸亦有必要，因而預算不能不隨之龐大。文武官增俸之一部，採物資俸給的辦法。淸鄉工作進展的結果，地方稅中田賦的收入，正在飛踹的增加。將來擬將如田賦等直接稅改爲中央稅，由中央支給財政補助金與地方。</p>
<p>（四）五月二十日的第五次國防會議，將商業統制總會由行政院直轄。監督行政雖更提高，但並不另在行政院新設事務機關，實際上仍由實業部及糧食部執行事務的監督。他方，諮詢審議機關的物資統制審議會，新設秘書處，強化事務的機構，以謀中日合作之企劃活動上的周密。</p>
<p>（五）商統會的全部機構完成，經濟的流通恢復後，積極進行傾注全力以復興上　的工業生產之計劃。在生產方面，正在硏究獲得原料，融通生產資金等各種側面的援助方策，但不另設如商統會之新機構。如其上海和內地的物資交流，生產增强能告實現，則與華北的物資交流，經濟的一體化，便易於進行，而向重慶地區的經濟攻擊亦成爲可能。經由經濟以把握民心，展開全而和平的道路，同時並實現中日　經濟的一體化，以對抗英美的生產力，而完遂大東亞戰爭。（翔：譯自五月二十八日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>緬甸一年來　軍政成績斐然可觀</h3>
<p>仰光三日中央社電　日軍自於去年敉平緬甸後即於六月三日頒布軍政，迄今適屆一年。在此一年間，緬甸之飛躍發展，實足令人驚嘆。今日之緬甸？已以大東亞共榮圈有力之一翼，而舉全國之力，協力完成大東亞戰爭。軍政監部政務部長大迫元繁氏特於二日發表談話，說明緬甸自實施軍政一年來之成績，茲錄其大意如次：緬甸自實施軍政以來迄今一年，已獲得飛躍之進展，軍政因得巴莫長官及行政府各部首腦之竭誠協力，故行政機構已備，政治力亦得滲透各地。國內輿論之統一工作，自德巴瑪新愛薩黨成立以來，即着着進行。緬甸前在英國統治時代，缺乏民族之團結力，現已藉此而逐漸予以修正。新緬甸必爲一民族協和之國家，其建國工作，今已準備就緒。至於治安亦極鞏固。惟目前須要强化地方警察刷新警政，造就優秀人材，派往各地服務，以謀治安之確保。又產業開發及復興工作，進行亦極順利。同時運輸機關之恢復，鐵道公路橋樑之修築工作，因得居民之熱誠協力，已獲莫大效果。緬甸產業向以米穀爲大宗，關於米穀之收買配給貯藏及防止生產降低等事，當局已採取各種對策，現當局對於生活必需品，已設立公定價格及標準價格，以期其安定。以言敎育，本年緬甸各地，預定開設日語學校五十所，日本文部省所派之日語敎師十名近將抵此。至職業敎育·海員養成所·及船工養成所等亦已開設，以海事局爲中心，授以必需之敎育。電信郵政於電政郵政兩總局開始辦公後，工作進行頗爲順利。衛生方面於義勇救護隊開始活動。及私立醫院成立後，漸吿充實，預料緬甸民衆對衛生之知識提高以後，霍亂鼠疫及瘧疾等傳染病必將减少。茲有最堪吾人注意之一事，即緬甸民衆於敵機猛烈空襲之下已毅然崛起，着手組織民防工作，並已於去年十二月十三日在各防衛地區，設立防衛聯絡委員會。現全國各地均組織義勇消防隊·養勇救護隊·防空監視隊·鐵道公路愛護隊·飛機塲輸油管警護團等，此等防衛組織，均由保甲　及村長負責，而以靑年階級爲組織之中心。按緬甸過去向乏民衆祖織，故民衆對於　種新組織均極感興味，且多樂於參加，其對緬甸之建設，必有莫大貢獻。緬甸施行軍政一年來之成績，槪括言之，乃爲緬甸業已成爲大東亞共榮圈之一份子，且已確立參戰體制，與日本共同協力打倒英美。同時當此種基礎上着重確立緬甸國內體制及復興民生工作而向前邁進。</p>
<h3>美煤礦罷工潮擴大　戰時勞工局下令中止談判　軍事工業已蒙受嚴重影響</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據此間砟晚接獲消息：美國煤業之大罷工潮已開始蔓延至伊利諾斯州各礦塲之美國勞工聯合會礦工。華盛頓之戰時勞工局昨日巳下令在罷工工人復工之前，停止進行談判解決工潮辦法。戰時勞工局致電與礦主及隸屬於工業組織大會之礦工聯合會主席路易斯，指摘此次罷工爲「無理由的違反不罷工之諾言」，並力言勞工局將不認許以脅迫而訂立之協定，電文中並謂該局又已將此事呈達羅斯福總統，請其爲必要之措施云，礦主及工會已遵照此項命令，將彼等之工資會議延展至下午二時，雙方皆未作任何評論。昨日下午羅斯福總統特召見內長伊克斯及戰時勞工局各員，於白宮討論罷工情况。同時煤礦停工之風潮昨日已蔓延至伊利諾斯州基萊斯比地方之礦塲五處，該五處雇有進步礦工工會之會員二千二百人，該工會係隸屬於曾正式拒絕參加全國罷工之美國勞工聯合會者。美國報紙對罷工事件仍甚重視，以大字爲「美國自開戰以來之最嚴重危機」「煤礦工人五十萬罷工對美國軍事工業有嚴重之　脅」等標題。據賓夕法尼亞·西弗吉尼亞及肯塔基等地之最近消息，所有隸屬於路易斯所領導之礦工聯合會之礦工，幾已全部罷工，但煤礦生產尙未至完全停頓，蓋一部份礦塲之礦工，並不隸屬於任何組織。羅斯福總統爲證實其所主張罷工礦工乃叛國之徒之立論，已要求勞工部發表軍工生產因罷工而受損失之數字，據此項統計，上月份軍用品產額所受罷工之影響，較之開戰以還之任何月份爲嚴重，工作時數之損失，從無該月之多，四月份內計損失六七五·〇〇〇工作日，但在五月份則煤礦克里斯勒工廠及俄亥俄州亞克倫橡皮業等罷工風潮紛起，損失之數又超過四月份矣。又據透露此次罷工使美國軍事工業每日損失烟煤二·二五〇·○〇○噸，白煤一〇三·〇〇〇噸，銅鐵業電力廠及鐵路等受礦工罷工之　脅尤甚。如罷工繼續，則鐵路之載客交通將更受限制，伊克斯內長已再度要求路易斯儘速終止罷工，伊氏係兼任燃料管理員，渠稱，罷工事件應由路易斯首任其咎，其次則一部份礦主堅決拒絕任何調協，亦不啻助紂爲虐。關於此點，據現時所得知，礦工已願意接受每日增加工資一元五角而不堅持其以前所要求之每日增加二元，但堅持此項增加工資，須追溯至四月一日起發生效力，但礦主方面則拒絕此項要求。</p>
<h3>英戰時內閣中　貝文地位重要</h3>

<h3>日本戰爭科學上的新利器　（五）</h3>
<p>超短波警戒機</p>
<p>在二三百籽的距離，目光所不能達到的天空中，向敵機放射强力　電波，從敵機的機體上立即發生反射作用，而電波仍復返原來發出的地點，於是敵機的所在，遂無從隱遁。　上，在聽不到聲音的上空，厚厚的雲層，遮蔽着日本的本土，敵機茍來偷襲，祗要一觸到這强力的雷波網，立即被發覺，而基地的戰鬥機，遂可以飛起迎擊。高射砲陣在茫茫黑夜中，可以向無形的鵠的，發射準確的砲火，佈成火網—「超短波警戒機」，乃是爲了準備比次大東亞戰爭，在電波戰上，經　十年來的辛勤硏究，恰在大東亞戰爭勃發之前，日本科學戰士完全研究成功，而成就了千古不滅的戰績。</p>
<p>發明者是陸軍第五技術硏究所稻葉榮中佐，此次亦榮授表彰。以下是他的談話—</p>
<p>天空是那樣的廣大，飛機在天空中所佔的地位是那樣的渺小。要向那樣渺小的目標從極遠的距離發射電波，果然能够得到它的反射嗎？關於這根本的問題，從十五六年前起，巳經是日本科學陣營中議論之的。此後數年間，與大電力之超短波發生的問頤聯繋起來，進行更深入的研究。爲適應世界航空戰術的進展，終究開始了自己着手這種兵器的製造。時在大東亞戰爭勃發前的昭和十五年。</p>
<p>戰爭勃發之後，從各地所鹵獲的敵軍兵器中，明瞭了世界各國從戰前起即巳在這種兵器的發明上費了不少　硏究。</p>
<p>在開始進行的時候，已經知道了即使那樣渺小的飛機，如向之發射電信，那電波可以發生相當强的反射。在我們的繼續硏究中，用電視術見到了飛機在飛行中的反射像，我們遂研究　樣應用那現象，同時並應用短波通信中測定空中電離層因季節，時刻而變化的狀態之原理，用這二種方法來測定從放射電波以至其反射歸回的這一瞬間的時間，於是正確地測定目力尙未見到的飛機之距離方向，位置，遂吿成功。這就是現在用以探知遠距離飛機的「超短波警戒機」。用於探知比較近的距離而精密度特別高的一種「超短波標定機」，同時亦吿成功。</p>
<p>這成功當然小是我仙人的力量，經過十年之久的基礎硏究，更廣泛地蒐　了衆智之粹，並由各方面的協力，特別不能忘却的是此次同被表彰的小林正次博士（現爲住友通　工業社員）給　　絕大的幫助。</p>
<p>我國在此方面的硏突，素落人後，故開始製造的時候，不能不先從試造基礎上的送信管，受信管着手。又爲保守硏究的秘密起見，這些試騐器材的意圖亦不能被民間的製造會社明瞭。因此，即使會社方面也不知道這在戰力上究有怎樣重大的影響，不知道有多少次對這硏究抱着焦慮之念。在此期間小林博士實在很辛勤地不偷片刻之暇而繼續研究。完成後不久，戰爭即行勃發，這兵器立即在各所準備起來，我鞏固的防空陣上更加上了新的威力。即使與鹵獲的兵器比較起來，其精度性能，並不較任何英美兵器有遜色。想起在此次聖戰中保衛東亞天空的使命時，小秣博士的勞苦實不是用言語所可報答的。（翔：譯自四月二十一日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>庫彭橋頭堡　德防禦戰進行順利　蘇軍大規模攻勢又遇挫　德機集團轟炸庫爾斯克</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　德元首大本營發表，庫彭河橋頭堡之東綫德軍，仍賡續進行激烈之防禦戰。德軍集中火力，卒使敵軍突破德軍之企圖歸於失敗。德軍常在敵軍未發動攻勢之前，即力挫之。該項防禦戰之成功，德機亦與有力焉。在東綫其他戰塲中，德軍突擊隊曾烽毀無數之敵軍埋伏地，蘇軍傷亡慘重。</p>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電　庫彭地區第三天作戰，自一日晨德軍展開攻勢後，又告開始。蘇軍爲德軍之誘導攻勢所吸引，實行猛烈反擊後，戰局對德軍愈形有利。蘇軍以坦克車五旅團狙擊兵約六師團，展開頑强之突破作戰。然到處遭德軍包圍殲滅，現德軍已獲偉大戰果。茲綜合各地區戰况如次：（一）蘇軍攻勢之主力，集中於庫爾伊妙斯克西方，曾以坦克車約二百輛爲先鋒，强製德軍陣地。然戰鬥開始後未及數分鐘，即喪失五十八輛，僅廿二輛坦克車突破成功。然此，坦克軍於庫爾伊妙斯克通達摩爾達朋斯克之道路上，遭德軍對戰車砲與高射砲之射擊，殆全被擊滅。（一）德蘇兩軍於庫爾伊姆斯克西北方之池沼地帶，亦展開激烈之坦克車戰，至一日下午止，蘇軍已喪失坦克車廿四架。關於該方面戰况因無確報，故尙未判明。（一）蘇軍爲攻擊泰曼半島入口之德軍陣地，曾以狙擊兵一師團圖於狄雷留克北方上陸，結果僅有一大隊上陸成功，蘇軍主力蒙致命打擊後已被擊退。上陸之蘇軍部隊亦爲德軍所包圍，不久即可殲滅。又德軍當局對中部戰綫斯摩倫斯克西北方威里保地區之戰鬥極爲重視，曾謂蘇軍已停止斯摩倫斯克之正面攻勢。而自西方展開迂廻作戰云。又蘇軍於一日自威里克爾基方面開到援軍後，對烏斯維牙多及伊利諾方面德軍陣地正面，終日展開攻擊激戰，結果蒙受重大打擊而向北方潰走，現戰鬥已略告一段落。其他戰綫蘇軍之局部攻勢甚活躍，然僅係偵察戰性質，經德砲兵隊之猛烈射擊，瞬即被擊退。又德軍當局二日發表東綫德軍於一日擊落蘇機五十一架。</p>
<p>莫斯科三日中央社電　據此間三日廣播：德空軍曾以一百架飛機之大隊，連續五次猛炸庫爾斯克市及該處鐵道設施，重創蘇軍部隊及其軍事設施。</p>
<h3>羅馬敎皇演說　指摘非人道轟炸</h3>
<p>梵蒂岡三日中央社電　敎皇庇護斯十二世，昨日向紅衣主敎發表演說，檢討空前戰及和平可能性各項問題。略謂敎會準備援助全世界之民眾，其最重大之使命，爲保障精神之遺產，而指增各項罪惡之錯誤。渠等不欲指　他人，而將領導人類向　理之途　進。敎令對各民族並不歧視，在現行戰畫中，渠已竭力使交戰國在空戰中尊重人道之法律，戰爭不能產生正義之和平，但　　和平人士於適當時機，必能竭力建設新世界，各國將恢復戰爭之創傷而携手前進。敎會以爲目前尙缺乏此項精神，渠籲請天主敎徒一致祈禱云。</p>
<p>羅馬三日中央社電　反軸心軍根據華盛頓會議之決定，乃當從事擾　軸心軍之後方，尤對義國本土曾屢行非人道之盲炸，而殘害一般無辜市民，且曾投彈轟炸修道院，神學校及敎會等地。羅馬敎皇於二日就任紀念日，對此曾指摘稱，戰鬥方法隨戰局之進展日益激化，所謂軍事目標似已無何區別，現不僅殘害個別之市民，甚至已威脅國民全體。敎會方面自歐戰開始時，即曾由盡方法，要求各交戰國於空襲時，務須尊重維護人道之各法則。此乃敎會對人類所　盡之義務云。又據義電訊報消息，英美兩國新聞界對反軸心空軍盲炸義本土事之態度已顯然對立，英國邱吉爾以下各當局及新聞界均主張以非人道之盲炸爲戰爭方法，而美國新聞檢查當局慮及將來選舉大總統時天主敎徒從中作梗，故關於反軸心軍空軍盲炸義本土，都市之消息則嚴重取締。</p>
<h3>哈里法克斯稱　戰事勢將延長　里斯本三日中央社電</h3>
<p>美京電訊云：英駐美大使哈立法克斯勛爵昨在波德蘭向各報記者發表談話，警告切勿輕信戰事將迅速結束之宣傳，並謂反軸心各國或不至在歐洲戰塲上長此毫無活動，惟戰事頗有長期及艱難之可能云。</p>
<h3>英美船舶損失　三千二百萬噸</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　此間海軍界人士宣稱：自戰事爆發以來，英美損失之船隻總數約爲三二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇噸，換言之，即彼等所損失之噸數，已超過戰爭開始時其商船隊之總噸位也。目前英美所有之貨船總數恐不足二一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇噸，約較一九三九年九月一日時減少一〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇噸，因美國之造船事業刻在積極進行，故上述情形倍堪注意。過去四十五個月中，英美始終未能克服德潛艇之危脅，日後自亦必如此。本年五月中反軸心方面損失船隻五〇〇·〇〇〇登記毛噸，或七五〇·〇〇〇載重噸位。自一九四三年一月以來，被日德義海空軍擊沉之反軸心船隻，共計三·四〇〇·〇〇〇登記毛噸。至於觸水雷或在海上受損而沉失之大批船隻，尙未列入以上數字之內。</p>
<h3>反軸心海軍　攻擊班泰勒利亞島　當被義軍砲台所擊退　東地中海德改善防務</h3>

<h3>埃及內閣改組</h3>
<p>開羅三日中央社電　據埃及內閣昨晚宣布改組，公共衛生部長兼代理社會部長埃狄恩被任爲內政部長。按該職前由總理那哈斯兼任，現那哈斯除任總理之職外，仍兼外交部長。奧斯曼被任爲財政部長，前社會事務部長哈克任農業部長。</p>
<h3>德國社黨　保安隊之任務</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　海通社訊：德國社黨黑衫衛隊領袖紐喀琴昨在德總彙報發表一文，對於國社黨保安隊之活動與任務，作初次之公開討論。據稱，該隊係由國社黨產生，並與德警察及秘密警察有密切之連繫。該隊隊員均爲行政專家·科學家·敎員·及經濟專家，均予以政治戰爭之工作。此項組織係於一九四〇年首次在報章披露，其時該隊若干領袖曾在荷蘭邊境附近文洛地方，捕獲英間諜二名，目前該隊在後方極爲活躍，其任務爲保護居民，該隊爲德秘密警察之一部，故自設宣傳部與德軍隊相同。</p>

<h3>時事選譯　美海空軍的訓練困難</h3>
<p>（里斯本義木特派負二十八日發）　美國誇說每月建造飛機七千架，一日造商船四艘。如果這是事實，則美國在大西洋太平洋上每日喪失的鉅額飛機和商船　或許可以補充了，但他們雖有的是物資，但苦於人力的不足。而且在海軍方面，更需要長時期的訓練。因此，英美最近正在拚命訓練補充的海軍兵員及航空隊員。</p>
<p>（一）航空隊員的大量養成問題</p>
<p>美海軍最緊要的問題是航空隊員的大量速成。自珍球灣一役以來，美國極力避免與日本艦隊作正面衝突，而企圖以空軍爲中心的太平洋長期戰。日美戰爭發開後，美海軍樹立二萬七千五百架的大空軍計劃，同時並擬每年向前綫供給飛行士三萬人，美國集合各軍艦所屬的專門家，組織「海軍飛行士訓練團」，以爲指導機關。但這龐大的計劃顯然是難於實行的。</p>
<p>培養一個飛行士，使能上第一綫戰鬥，至少需二百五十小時以上的訓練飛行時間。假定有學生用每月費一百小時的飛行時間來熱心練習，成績亦不見優良。又一個敎官如其訓練六個學生，其中必有二人不及格，這是通例。那就是說，訓練的三分之一的時間是白費的。</p>
<p>因訓練的能率化之要求，美海軍最近樹立了難於實行的「所有飛行訓練的人都必須卒業」的方針。可是到現在爲止，實際擔任飛行士訓練的專家，視此爲無理的要求。事實上據美國陸海軍飛行士養成的經騐，大槪有百分之四十的學生是不及格的，那末他們採甚麼對策呢？第一，嚴於事前的銓衡，第二，增大敎官的指導能率。</p>
<p>關於第一項，首先恢復　募者的心理試騐，這試騐現由人的資源委員會及徵兵局任之。第二項指導能率化的問題，從事敎官的指導飛行之劃一化，標準化，由飛行士七名組設特別的指導機關，他們巡迴全國的訓練飛行塲，試騐各敎官的飛行技術，檢查指導能力。</p>
<p>其訓練程序，被取爲飛行士候補生者，先入民間飛行訓練所的初等科，通過初級訓練，昇入海軍預備飛行學校，受海軍航空隊員的基礎敎育，飛行士的優劣，大槪在此過程中決定。自開始飛行　。約七個月後，始承認其有海軍航空隊員的資格。</p>
<p>以上是一年前美海軍產生航空隊員的手續。其訓練的理想。固然在日數上須經七個月以上，在飛行時間上須二百五十小時以上，但在現在這樣飛行士大量消耗的戰爭中，派遣至第一綫的是否都經過這理想的訓練，不無疑問。據美方的發表，據說每月有數千人，進入海軍飛行訓練所的大門，七個月後到艦隊去服務的新飛行士，如其不從寬允許其卒業，則勢必不能與天文學數字的飛機增產率相符應。但他們對質的向上亦正加以最大的注意，以本年夏季爲期，以最高度的完成爲目標而拚命努力。</p>
<p>（二）艦隊人員的補充問題</p>
<p>珍珠灣一役以來，和無數被擊沉的軍艦同在命運的美國士官，水兵敵，當然超過了萬數。爲了補充並募集水兵起見，他們許下了莫大的俸給和種種特權給與投効海軍者。</p>
<p>在和平時代，因此動機而應募爲水兵者佔大部分，故常多脫走。一九三六年美日危機在謠傳的時候，美國水兵的脫走者特別多。這是美海軍首腦感到頭痛的一件事。此次戰爭中，這種事實當然不再發表，所以其詳不得而知，不過美國水兵的氣質不會有何變更，恐脫走的情況今日仍未絕跡。</p>
<p>他們因體騐了日本海軍之直接間接的威脅，不願意再當吃力不討好的水兵，而想投到出風頭的航空部隊中，即其明證，水兵內稱爲麥令（Marine）的海兵部隊，美海軍在此次戰爭中特加重視。從水兵中選撥素質特別優良者組成如日本海軍中的海軍陸戰隊，在瓜島上陸的就是這種麥令部隊。瑪伊阿密海岸的旅館，跳舞塲，酒吧間，都爲了大量的訓練麥令部隊而一變爲麥令的宿舍，敎室。</p>
<p>士官的服裝也是美海軍感到頭痛的所事。阿那波里斯的海軍學校是以戰時特權階級的學校著稱的大總統，上下二院的議院，州知事等都各有向海軍兵學校推薦若干名入學學生的權利。所以該校學生的大都是特權階級的寵兒，是社交界的明星，其敎育亦極繁重。</p>
<p>但其反面，學校中所實施的敎育相當嚴重，入學者普通有二成以上不能及格一日入學後，如決定其不適於爲海軍士官，則與軍務的關係就此告終。在目前的戰事方甜中，是否還照舊繼續這種繁重的敎育嗎？在事實的必要之前，這傳統恐要崩壞了吧！據最近的新聞所傳，學生的　集，急速地增加了。（詳：譯自五月二十九日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>英國膽怯了</h3>
<p>歐戰的現階段，據消息所傳是：德義與英國之間的猛烈轟炸戰，但是在英國却發現了奇怪的反響。</p>
<p>英當局向國民鼓吹道：最近轟炸德國兩部工業區，頗奏奇效。但是因爲此項轟炸而產生了二個不容易的結果，他們現在大爲狼狽。因了當局一個誇張宣傳，以致於錯覺的觀心理，充斥在國內，英當局動員言論機關，向國民宣稱：「轟炸遍及德國土地，予以重創，德國再不能來空襲英國。爲求阻碍德國的積極戰事起見，所以尙須大規模的空襲」。還有一個怪現象，就是其本國空軍的損害太大。據英國航空部長在下院發表：自本年正月起，喪失的飛機爲六百九十九架，駕駛員爲四千六百人。然則喪失率，也隨着歲月而增多，單是四月份，就喪失了二百八十　。五月份如何，我們祇要看看擊落英機的消息不斷傳來，就曾明折了。例如最近英機在轟炸特爾陪蒙德之際，喪失了飛機四十四架與駕駛員三百五十名，這一個月喪的　字，也足夠驚人了。對於德國的軍事工業，未能予以重創，自身反而蒙受了致命打擊，國內的物議是當然的了。</p>
<p>然而，一方面德國的報復空襲倒非常厲害，尤以德國最近所使用之新的炸彈，威力驚人，英國國內大感威脅，居然　出了悲鳴。德當局關於此項炸彈的性能，不加何種說明，還是保守沉默。宣傳工作，不用仿照英美那樣自吹自擂，儘可由炸彈的威力去表現，　敵人去體味它的神效吧。省了些宣傳工夫，還是繼續多加轟炸的好。（雲鵬：譯自五月二十九日每日新聞社論）</p>
<h3>華盛頓會議</h3>
<p>歷時半月的華盛頓會議，直至五月二十五日，方告結束，結論如何，我們無從得悉，也不一定要知其究竟。但是宣傳機關則循例有各種富於興趣之報導。</p>
<p>來　消息，是否爲其眞相，又當別論，總之其議題是那一種，早就明瞭的了。曾經反覆說過，他們的第一議題，就是今後的作戰重心，置於歐洲或是置於太平洋；第二個議題，京是英美與蘇聯之關係如何做到共同戰綫的形式，當然除此之外，還有其他附屬於戰局的問題提出討論，但求最重要者，不外爲以上兩種議題。聽說第一種議題，因爲英美本身各不抵觸，所以已獲結論。大槪美國儘量注重於太平洋，英國儘量注重於歐洲。至少在本年內，不會在東亞發動大規模攻勢。滇緬公路的奪囘等等，也不會嘗試的。所以就整個局勞而視，爲英美作戰的蔣介石與蘇聯，蔣介石方面在英美未能綽有餘裕之前，唯有痛苦，對於蘇聯，好像有從地中海予以援助的意向。</p>
<p>總之，華盛頓會議的結果，羅斯福的政治上理想，沒有得到便宜，無疑是邱吉爾的勝利。因爲獨擋日德義軸心的羅斯福，他想把邱吉爾拉到東亞來，可是沒有成功，而且與史太林的會談尙未實現，兩者之間不能作何具體決定，我們對於報導機關所傳對方的決定案如何，不能置信，應該自己來考察其報導的矛盾地方。（雲鵬：譯自五月十九日每日新聞社論）</p>

<h3>陳市長談　調查存底取締囤積　積極籌設物資調查委員會</h3>
<p>本市陳市長奉令兼任物資調查財委員長後，即積極籌備會務，昨日記者記者晋謁陳市長，叩詢一切，承發表談話如次：</p>
<p>查戰時經濟，最重要者，莫如生產之增加，與物資之支配，而支配適當，尤在於取締囤積，調查存底。上海一隅，自事變以後，游資充斥，商儈因緣爲利，莫不趨於囤積之途，紇至主要物品，存義豐富，流通絕少，價格日漲，民生維艱，長此以往，勢必小而貽害社會，大而影響戰局。政府有鑒於有此，特先明令取締囤積，嚴定罰則，俾奸商知所警懼，物資便於流通。前此特派大員，來滬澈查，一切情形，具見報載；同時對於金融事業，亦經澈底調查，一面由中儲收回放款，以減少市面之游資：一面嚴厲檢查行放，以免人民獲有囤積之機會。經月以來，懲前毖後，故復有物價調查委員會之設立。本人以市長職責所在，奉令兼任該會委員長，並由政府特派高級官員，會員友邦官吏，組織本會，俾可通力合作，分別調查，倘查有囤積操縱情事，自當呈報政府，依法處理，庶物資存底之數量，因而明瞭，則將來適當之支配，自易著手，需要旣可不感缺乏，價格亦更期更低落，俾合於戰時統制經濟之原則云。</p>
<h3>短評　爲張案敬告法當局</h3>
<p>轟動全滬，羣情憤激的張金海一案，自經法總領事馬傑禮，於五月十二日答覆上海市陳市長一文，承認法捕房探長米雷有犯罪行爲，飭令拘禁法辦，並賠償張氏家屬恤金十萬元，曁聲明歉意，保證以後嚴令捕房人員不准有粗暴行爲以外，復對該案其餘人犯，解送中國法院訊辦。該案至此，原可告一段落。我們曾言：「法當局能重視與情，依法措置，尙屬差强人意。」老實說，上海市民，也可以說中國人民，素來具有最肯忍耐尊重友誼的德性。可是，並不漠視公理，在公理與友誼的比重過於懸殊的情勢之下，也會「好人發怒」的。張案的本質，固然是社會事件，法律事件，而所以引起羣情的一致憤激者，其原因就在「公理與友誼的比重過於懸殊。」迨至法當局正式表示以後，大家認爲公理與友誼的比重相當接近，在「差强人意」的忍耐之下，羣情纔告平息。我們相信法租界當局者，決不至於不領會這個關鍵吧。</p>
<p>然而，法租界行政當局對於張案人犯的起訴，初則一再以偵查未畢而聲請展期，特二法院已屢次勉允，並聲明今日庭期不能展期，而法租界方面，正式送達之起訴書，對該案中三人犯，竟不予起訴。我們雖不忍遽說法當局有意爲該在人開脫罪刑，可是，旣經特二院檢察處偵查終結，事實明瞭，凡涉有犯罪嫌疑者，均應依法起訴。難道法當局認爲三人竟毫無犯罪嫌疑而不予起訴呢？實在令人難於索解。中國法院自當依據法例進行審理，不能負「執法者違法」的責任。</p>
<p>我們著重的告訴對於此案有關係的法租界當局諸位，千萬愼重的依法處理，不能逞使意氣。遵守中法協定的約束，尊重中國法律的尊嚴，這是共應具備的條件。</p>
<h3>經濟界　評言　經濟界與華北急賑</h3>
<p>華北災况，嚴重達於極點，數千萬嗷嗷待賑之飢民，舉延頸企踵，等待我們急急賑濟，以解倒懸之厄。我工商金融各界人士處　較優，手頭較寬，對此慘痛的災情，更覺責無旁貸，　不容辭了。我們認爲目前經濟界做的幾件事，要趕快的來實行的是：</p>
<p>（一）各人將所有經營工商業的機關，來實行節約，把平時可省的費用，如節酒禮品，悉數捐入華北賑災之用。</p>
<p>（二）自後工商金融各界辦理喜慶祝壽時，均須特別節約，不備酒筵，並將筵席費用，悉充華北賑災之用，（聞五和織造廠任君弄璋即以筵席費移充賑濟華北災民，爲親友祝福，又培養蒙　服公司同人移　端節筵資助賑等，大可效法）。</p>
<p>（三）金融業應先貸金賑災會，準備巨金趕快採辦雜糧，運赴華北，以供災民嗷嗷之用。</p>
<p>（四）商統會應會同雜糧業同業公會商量收購雜糧步驟，義務買賣，以盡商民救災的責任。</p>
<p>（五）工商界應與金融界共同推選公正人士赴華北實施測勘災情，商量整個的救濟辦法，同時並應與上海華北急賑會通力合作，連籌救濟方案。張雲搏氏言：「目前我們救濟賑災的責任，只有一個速字」。希望工商界，大家來實行速賑，因爲辦賑愈速，活人愈多。</p>
<h3>中儲接辦銀聯會交換所後　票據交換差額清算辦法</h3>
<p>爲增强中央儲備銀行之金融調整力，而使一般金融機關能漸次適應國家金融政策起見，上海銀行業聯合準備委員會票據交換所各銀行交換差額之清算，自六月一日起移交中央儲備銀行辦理，其交換要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）聯合準備委員會票據交換所，於本年五月卅一日交換清算完畢後，將各交換銀行所有存款之餘款，全部移存於中央儲備銀行上海分行，各銀行之交換清算戶，各交換銀行交換差額之清算，自六月一日起，每日交換終了後，就各交換銀行交換清算戶收付之，每日交換之地點，仍在聯合準備會交換所，該所之內容及原有業務，決不加以變更，（二）各交換銀行，因交換清算存款餘額不足卻說付該行當日應付之差額，而需要補充資金時，或向中央儲銀行拆借，或照向例辦法，向聯合準備會交換拆借，悉聽交換娗之便。（三）聯合準備委員會交換所，至現在爲止，代理各銀行收款業，凡爲非交換銀行委託辦理理，其辦法均仍照售，凡爲交換銀行委託辦理者，應於收得款項後，開具中儲支票交付，委託銀行應不再有交換銀行存款戶之開立云。</p>

<h3>大眾生活　南貨店員的生活</h3>
<p>— 培</p>
<p>我們這一羣的店員，也被一般人們稱一聲先生。這大　是套着一件破長衫的關係罷？想想眞覺得慚愧。現在把我們的生活情形說說：</p>
<p>早上七時左右，我們都要起身了。經過洗面，吃粥後，一個個像石獅如的伏在櫃臺上等待買主。九時後買主漸漸的多了，我們開始拿了秤，在店堂裏轉開了秤貨化，有的在櫃臺上紮紙我。老板呢，如悠閒如監視的坐在賬臺上。</p>
<p>十二點鐘見午飯時候了，大的店家是分先後二次　前，中等以下的店家是一次吃的，那就有點可憐了！飯才得進口，買主已在櫃臺上敲起來了，只好立起來包着一口飯做生意，如果在冷天，　好生意再吃，飯菜都冷了。只好用開水來送上去。</p>
<p>下午比較空一點，店規寬一點的，那末大家坐一會兒看看報，店規嚴一些的，老板正會面現怒容的監視，你唯恐偷懶，所以只好早上立到晚上，身體疲乏，只好忍受着。又有誰來憐惜呢！</p>
<p>因爲米價貴，所以多數的店家的夜飯改成粥了，這是老板們會打算處。</p>
<p>近時因爲當局　通告節電，所以我們在八時後因打烊而得休息了。否則非到十時後不可。</p>
<p>我們的睡室是怎樣呢？多數是擱樓。三塊板幾只箱子所組織成的床，新鮮空氣當然沒有，陽光是終年不會光臨的，衛生是根本談不到了！</p>
<p>再談談我們的收入罷，月薪月規米貼三合一自七十元至一百六十元，這個數目夠什麼用，在這百物飛漲的目前，所以已結婚者家裏有點家產還可，沒有家產的，只能另想方法，如今眷屬忍苦販米販貨等。</p>
<p>這幾年的店家都很有錢的，可是多數的老板的心是很兇的，派給店員之花紅，只有百分之五，這做店員的又有什麼話呢！誰致抗議，誰就準備捲舖蓋。</p>
<p>我們還有一件苦事，就是要套一件勞什子的長衫，襪子和鞋子。不能　　　者的服裝守在櫃臺裏。</p>
<p>記得某君發明過一個名辭呌「隱貧」。眞是好像我們這一羣所設想的呢。</p>

<h3>國民論壇　對於救災的建議與籲求</h3>
<p>— 名世</p>
<p>我是新從華北來的，身受過災民的苦痛，說幾句切膚的話，貢獻於救災當局諸公：</p>
<p>（一）賑款與賑糧；這次華北的災情，不在「款」的不足，而在「糧」的不足。說起糧的不足，本不自今日始，原來華北在豐收的年頭，所產食糧，也只夠消費量的百分之八十，後來華北在東亞共榮團內，努力於棉花的供給，結果因爲棉田的遞增，遂致產糧的田畝面積，隨之日減。</p>
<p>所以即使沒有此次大旱，民食的不足，業已非常顯明。譬如前年北京的郊民，已經在吃樹皮了。但是市內的糧荒，都還不十分顯明，乃是因事變以來，　商從澳美國進的麵粉來源斷絕，於是在北京市內，糧食市塲中，樹皮也就開盤了。所以惟有能在華北以外，購進食糧，運入災區，才是眞正的救濟。</p>
<p>（二）賑糧的選購；目前在南方採購大米，北運救災，似乎是最簡單敏捷的方式。可是大米是南方人民的主要食糧，若有大量北運，當然不致造成華中的米荒，亦必因之抬高米價，而增加貧民生活的苦痛。所以採購大米不如採購麵粉不如採購雜糧。這樣一方面救濟了華北的災民，一方面也不很影響華中人民的生計。因爲大部分華中人民是不吃雜糧的。</p>
<p>此中當然也有經濟的理由，因爲雜糧總比大米價　；以同量的金錢，購買雜糧，要比購進大米多救活幾多人命。</p>
<p>還有極有興趣的一點：某一時期，北京的糧價非常混亂，譬如麵粉賣三塊錢一斤，小米也是同價。結果貧民仍是爭前恐後地搶買小米。其實小米是粗糧，麵粉是精製品，平常麵粉的價錢總比小米要高一倍的。但是貧民爲何不買麵粉呢？因爲他們不是囤積，而是治肚子飯。普通人吃半斤小米可以飽的，要吃麵粉，半斤就不夠了。所以要救濟化境經，無論從那一方面着想，雜糧是最合宜的賑糧。</p>
<p>（三）採購賑糧的地點：按照由報募捐的報告，截至現在共收四十餘萬元。此數若匯往河南開封，只能購進小米一萬六千斤，但在濟南即可購入三萬二千斤，在張家口即可購入八萬斤，在滿洲國就可以購進差不多十六萬斤了。反之，要是在開封以外的商邱等災區，就地購糧發放，大約連一萬六千斤也買不到手。</p>
<p>在戰時統制經濟的狀況一，物價的畸形形態，原是無可避免的。而爲着救濟將死的災民，我們似應盡最善的努力，務必在不妨害各區域的整個的政策的條件之下，希望獲取最大的政策的條件之下，希望獲取最大的效果。我想我們這種努力必能博得友邦日本滿洲蒙疆的政府的同情的攷慮。</p>
<p>（四）對　中央的籲求；從上所述，可知慈善家的力量是微弱的。我們并且知道化華北一部分的政治力量也是不夠的。從去年華北人民有錢買不着食糧的恐慌發生後，華北執政當局就和各方面折衝了，結果至今情形的嚴重，絲毫未減。這是在戰時情態下，統制的機構太多，所以事項的圓滑進行，未免非常困難。</p>
<p>如果由中央出面，和友邦日本，滿洲及蒙疆的中央機構接洽，則一切難題，迎刃而解。譬如如蒙疆，其食糧的消費量恰與華北成爲反比，即消費量只佔生產量百分之廿。從蒙疆駐北京的發主從的聲說，蒙疆希望以其食糧來交換華北的製成品，也如同華北想以製成品來交換蒙疆的食糧一樣的殷切。</p>
<p>何時這種交換能夠實現呢？在友邦改換對華政策的今日，中央政府的努力，一完會獲得成功的。</p>
<h3>「把握現在」與「關心政治」</h3>
<p>— 張亦聯</p>
<p>邇自國府參戰後，友邦日本自動改變對華政策以還，有識之士咸深慶幸。按斯舉乃吾人夙所渴望者，一旦來之，誠是可貴難得之時機，更是復興中國之轉捩關鍵。</p>
<p>當政者在斯時比如「六　在握」，不似從前礙手礙足或顧此失彼，是以正可兼程並進，表現作爲，而取得民心之最好時季。所以凡仍在觀望而滯留於現階段者，已屬落伍，甚而若忽視時機，致交臂失之，則爲可恥。諒當政者大都認識清楚，不致有些失悮也。</p>
<p>故在人民方面，更應如何「臨深履薄」地去把握這不易之時機，應知努力本位，急起直追尙趕人不及。至於少數頑固份子，意識不清仍錯視現在祇不過是「過渡時期」，政治尙未澄澈，故無需緊張，無需把握，儘可徘徊，此種見解實屬大謬，宜亟告以利益，示知新認識。</p>
<p>蓋國人習慣，大都忽視現在，理想將來，要知，沒有現在的努力，美滿的將來，豈會從天而降？</p>
<p>綜括言之，政府已逐步顯出把握有爲，人民當更增强信念，必能追踪前進的。</p>
<p>上述是提倡「把握現在」之重要性，後面是「關心政治」的理由。</p>
<p>一般人民大都受昔日渝共時代言論思想之縛束，壓抑久之，遂養成不管國事之風氣，致政府自政府，人民自人民，政府之國策法令，非强迫行之則置若不聞，平日如此已不可以，今在此自拔自救之時機內，則更不應該。故人民亟應關心政治，以期了解政府，與政府融融洩洩打成一片，則辦事成効當事半功倍，而復興强國亦有待矣。且還消除目前一般人民「羣居終日本言不及義」之不良現象。</p>
<p>故「關心政治」，積極方面可促成政民一體，消極方面使人民更適應戰時生活。惟人民旣關心政治後，或者有言論來表示，此則有需當政者有容言雅量，不讀批評，幸而吾人責明的領袖汪主席是贊許人民言論的，那麼，現在正是「關心政策」的好時候。</p>
<p>假使能提倡這二個口號普及於大眾，諒必對復興中國，與建設東亞上都有極大之幫助。</p>

<h3>原始的生活藝術</h3>
<p>— 包明</p>
<p>在生活的藝術這個名詞未創出以前，人們的藝術生活早就存在着，自西洋的新名望兒傳入後，使人覺得自己平凡的生活原來就有高尚的藝術包括在其中。</p>
<p>鄉間的老農他們的簡樸而刻板的生活，生活在一般人看來應該撇在藝術範圍以外，可是別小看了他們在年頭好的時候，白天忙完了工作，夕陽西沉，烏鴉歸巢，他們會有一瞬間的休息，啣着根早烟竿，眺向無邊際的原野，一口口烟悠閒地吐出，誰也不知道他們在想什麼。</p>
<p>原野上的一片土息氣，透進了每一個毛孔中，他們想到遼遠的天涯，這就是他們的生活藝術，在這個時候他們就在欣賞生活，忘知了一切，將身心弛鬆，消融在領會的興味中。</p>
<p>可是當天災人禍想隨屬，苦痛悲慘的命運緊逼着他們，他們亦會起來奮鬬求解放，求生存，這也可說他們的生活藝術。</p>
<p>這是藝術，高尚的藝術人類的光輝，就從這單純的念頭中發身出文化的光輝，在他們的簡樸生活中創造了藝術，這種生活藝術是值得景崇的，學習的。</p>
<p>他們表現在生活中的藝術不是形式的，不是修飾的，更沒有享受這高善的藝術的自覺，像紳士們坐在沙發上嘴裏含着大烟斗，欣賞油畫或圖案，隨便翻末書吟哦聲，默想着女人，鈔票，營私，自命過着藝術的生活。</p>
<p>但這樣的生活算是藝術，那我始終不敢贊同，正因爲我欽仰那單純的出自內心的優美生活，人類的最高尙的深處爲出發點。雖然我們從紳士的表面所見到的整潔，富麗，光彩。而不知這整潔，光彩，富麗的後面是包藏着罪惡，吃人的血他們假裝的藝術生活令人作嘔，痛心。</p>
<p>爲什麼呢？這是因爲他們的手段太毒險，他們的外貌太和善，想要在吃人的工作之暇來消遣一下身心名之曰「生活的藝術」，以圓滿過罪惡。他們以爲一投足一舉手要有藝術的表現，讀書要有藝術，談話會客也要有藝術的條件，這些瑣屑的僞飾有什麼用，想掩蓋一切罪惡，名曰清高，使那眞正藝術永離開他們。</p>
<h3>災民進行曲</h3>
<p>— 災民</p>
<p>天吝嗇給我們雨露，</p>
<p>這兒是滿眼的枯焦，滿耳的啼號！</p>
<p>活過了今宵，不知道明朝。</p>
<p>太陽在頭上燒着，</p>
<p>飢餓在肚子裏熬着，</p>
<p>天哪，我們已經掘盡了蕨根，</p>
<p>抽盡了蘆茅；</p>
<p>剝盡了梧桐，斫盡了芭蕉，</p>
<p>我們已吃到了地下的泥，</p>
<p>連死人的肉也沒有饒！</p>
<p>我們逃到別處去吧？</p>
<p>別處的也往我們這兒逃。</p>
<p>天哪，我們千百萬無辜的人民，</p>

<p>難道祇有死路一條！</p>
<p>難道祇有死路一條！</p>

<p>你們喝茶的時候，別忘了我們挑水要走十里遙，</p>
<p>你們一元錢可以活我們一條命，</p>
<p>你們一滴眼淚可以潤我們一根苗。</p>
<p>我們全國親愛的同胞，全國親愛的同胞！（移酬捐華北旱災）</p>
<h3>誠勤耐勞</h3>
<p>— 蔣國璋</p>
<p>我記得上海某大藥廠的廠訓是誠·勤·耐·勞，這四個字用作廠訓雖然是再適宜也沒有。然而用作我們的座右銘。亦未她不可。</p>
<p>誠就是誠實。不誠實就是欺騙，喜歡欺騙的人，是終究不會成大事業的，試問世界上成大事業的人，那一個是由欺騙得來的？</p>
<p>勤就是勤儉。不勤儉就是懶惰，崇德老人說，人勤則健，家勤則興。我們要人健家興。能不勤儉嗎？</p>
<p>耐就是忍耐。不忍耐就是燥急。所謂小不忍耐則能亂大謀。普通一個脾氣燥急的人，容易肇禍，也就是不忍耐的緣故。</p>
<p>勞就是勞苦。不勞苦就是安逸，往往窮苦人家的孩子，能成大事業，富貴人家的子女要墮落，也是就勞苦和安逸的結果。世界上的大人物，那一個不是從勞苦中扎掙來的？</p>
<p>總而言這：這誠·勤·耐·勞·四個字是否人立身處世所不可缺少的。我希望我們大家能把他作爲座右銘。時時照着他做去（酬移助學）</p>
<h3>日本海軍與聞錄（九）</h3>
<p>— 大下宇陀兒</p>
<p>（十二）海防費獻金的先驅者</p>
<p>明治天皇對於海防的事情　爲軫念。明治二十六年二月十日，頒詔稱自今起六年間，在御內帑金中提出三十萬圓，並　納一般文武官的俸給的十分之一，用以建造軍艦富士，八　明石，宮古四艘。（這四艘中的富士艦，今爲航海學校的練習艦，去年六月，大日本學徒海洋班指導者在此艦上經受五日間的實務講習）在此以前，明治二十年三月十四日，頒詔下賜海防充實費三十萬圓。</p>
<p>明治二十年的前一年，那年從法國歸航途中的軍艦畝傍號，行踪不明。拜受了三月十四日詔書以後，重臣就集議今後的方針。三月二十三日在鹿鳴館也曾協議海防問題。明日早晨，茨城縣人川崎某，訪問上京中的茨城縣知事於其宿舍，問縣知事說：</p>
<p>「聽說昨日在鹿鳴館曾集議天皇陛下的諭旨。我平時一向想爲了報答國恩，多少爲國家出點力。鹿鳴館所討論的是些甚麼呢？」</p>
<p>知事就告訴他皇上賜金的意思。川崎某立即到隣室去，寫就一封信獻於知事，願以茨城縣一個民眾的地位，獻納三萬金爲海防費。</p>
<p>那次的申請獻納，就成爲先驅，民間繼之獻納者達二百萬金以上。</p>
<p>這可說是獻艦運動的嗃矢。另一感動的故事，在日俄戰爭的時候，有一上崎雪子的女人，首倡水雷艇獻納運動。</p>
<p>上崎雪子的丈夫，是參加日清戰爭時威海衛夜襲戰的水雷艇船員。然而那時候上崎上等兵曹遭遇了大失敗。當時以敵旗艦定遠爲目標，想放射水雷，但被冰把發射管封閉了。敵方的子彈，如雨般飛來，故不能發射水雷。</p>
<p>是夜確確實實命中定遠的水雷有三顆。然而到明天早上，那定遠艦依然悠哉遊哉地浮沈於該港的中央，我方以爲水雷這東西對鐵甲艦沒有效果。正在這樣想時，那艦漸趨下沉，在黃昏之前，完全沈沒了，大家方才覺得安心。但上崎上等兵曹，因感到發射水雷遇到窒碍的責任，自行切腹以殉。</p>
<p>之後，未亡人的胸中，秘藏着一顆怎樣爲丈夫償夙志的念頭。明治三十七年五月，日本海軍因在濃霧中發生事故，喪失了軍艦初漱號與吉野號。波羅的海艦隊，向東洋航行中，常陸丸佐渡丸被派遣去了。於是聽說敵艦三艘出沒於東京灣附近，伊豆大島洋面發現艦踪跡，可聞砲聲。這時候，上崎未亡人，亦即着手水雷艇的獻納運動。</p>
<p>下田歌子女史爲其後援，在本所壽座爲了獻艇運動而舉行演劇。於是艦　水雷艇的獻納運動終告完成。（翼：譯自西部朝日新聞）（完）</p>
<h3>美之原理</h3>
<p>— 江渢</p>
<p>「愛美是人的天性」這句話，現在幾乎成爲一般摩登小姐的幌子了！</p>
<p>時常看到一些年青女郎塗脂，抹粉，畫眉毛，搽脣膏，塗指甲，奶油電燙，着高跟鞋，穿花色炫人眼目的緊裏着身子的衣服，甚至在脚指上塗蔻丹，在脚踝骨上戴鐲子……把自己打扮得「妖裏妖氣」。若是誰問她們：「爲什麼這么漂亮？」囘答是：「愛美是人的天性，人生來就是喜歡漂亮的！」</p>
<p>其實，他們只是慕虛榮罷了，那裏懂得美的眞諦。有「內心的美」和「外表的美」二種，一個人所最需要的是前者，諸如純潔的靈魂，堅強的意志，完美的人格，崇高的道德，溫和的品性，奮鬥的精神……；而非後者。</p>
<p>況且，即使「外表的美」，也沒有一定的標準。甲以爲美的，乙未必也可以爲美。在有一班人看來，果然是花枝招展，艷麗非凡；但在另一些人，也許會認爲妖形怪狀，醜惡不堪。你不信嗎？有小詩一首爲證：</p>
<p>鮮花上塗了奶油，</p>
<p>旣不美麗又不雅觀；</p>
<p>自然的美被其遮掩，</p>
<p>獨立的人格遭其損傷；</p>
<p>只引來了一羣嚵嘴的蒼蠅！</p>
<p>但是我很奇怪：</p>
<p>爲什麼偏有些花兒</p>
<p>歡喜自動地塗上奶油？！</p>
<p>妓女，舞女等被男人視爲玩具的女人，爲了麪包，不得不塗上厚厚的一層奶油，這在醜惡的現社會，是免不了的事。但是有些閨閣千金，小家碧玉，並沒有受到生活的鞭策，爲了錯誤的「愛美」心理，居然也學起舞女等的榜樣來，殊使人大惑不解！</p>
<h3>吸收</h3>
<p>— 百廖</p>
<p>記得有次生物先生講到消化的時候，特別提出人類以及一切生物要食物以維持其生命，最重要的一點，就在於消化後能將異體變爲已體。那時這句話已相當引起我的注意，現在我更深深體騐到這是一個人成功事業的關鍵。</p>
<p>從人生長方面來講，有些人吃許多東西不見強壯，有的人吃東西並不多而身體挺結實，這就在於後者能「吸收」。</p>
<p>再從讀書方面來講，我們可以看見許多人讀了許多書，學問豐富，但是他並不能出人頭地，相反地，有些人讀的書並不多，而有作爲，有本領，事業成功，理想實現。這是什麼緣故？簡捷地說一句，就是一種人會讀書，一種人不會讀書。會讀書的人注重「吸收」，無論那種書本，只要是有益的，就拚命吸收，使書上的東西，做爲自己的東西，那麼眞正地進步了；不會讀書的人，不知道「吸收」，徒然浪費精力，時間和金錢，而沒有進步，這是多麼可惜呢！</p>
<p>我們可以知道，往往事情一樣，而人人得益不同，這全在乎各人「吸收」能力的強弱了。我敢說，偉人的成功主要的原因是他們能絲毫不浪費地「吸收」。</p>
<p>不要放鬆任何小機會，努力地吸收！</p>
<p>這樣你可發現，到處都是訓練的地方。</p>
<h3>萍踪小語（三）</h3>
<p>— 謙父</p>
<p>眞正的學問，不在乎多記書本上的東西，而在乎能得與人生有關之事物的眞道理。所以，在讀書中，當有充分的時間做默想和修省的工夫，就能綜合書中的精義，而憬悟人生的眞理。</p>
<p>有「道德」才有「道理」，沒有「道德」，就沒有「道理」，因爲「道理」是由「道德」所產生的。所以不講「道德」的人，必定是不講「道理」的，也許他們會根據着風俗，習習慣，規條，法律當着是「道理」，但那不過是「道其所道」「理其所理」，並不是切合當時，當地，該人，該事，其情，　景的「眞道」「眞理」。（却酬）</p>
<h3>金玉良言</h3>
<p>— 蔡痴墨</p>
<p>奢華是貧困的引導，貧困是奢華的成功。</p>
<p>貧困可解散友誼，富貴可引起朋友。</p>
<p>大丈夫除當然服從外，悉宜自動。</p>
<p>生活越勞苦，越能生活，精神越快樂，越有精神。</p>
<p>「福氣」不是指多子多孫，多財多勢。乃指能遊歷各處，增長見識，纔是「福氣」。</p>
<p>現在的辛苦，是將來的快樂。</p>
<p>用研究工夫，在正當方面，便成了事業，用研究工夫，在不正當方面，便成了罪惡。</p>
<p>懷疑生，而猜忌多，猜忌多，而誤會生。</p>
<p>和氣不蝕本，生氣不賺錢。</p>
<p>待已，當無過中求有過，待人，當有過中求無過。</p>
<p>世界最苦惱的，只是貪心。</p>
<p>常在正大良善方面着想，心地自然光明。</p>
<p>人生脫不了互助，脫互助，便難生活。</p>
<p>去一分奢華，少一分罪過。</p>
<p>事物須加研究，不研究，總是糊塗。</p>

<h3>滬江小學師生　響應街童救濟運動</h3>
<p>私立滬江小學全體敎職員及學生昨日來函云：「兒童是人間的天使，國家未來命運的主宰者，際此生活受嚴重威脅的時候，這些活潑的小主人翁也遭受到空前的浩刧，尤其是那些喪失了父母的孤兒，他們孤苦無依，流浪失所，這一羣迷途的羔羊，誰也知道是亟待着吾人的救護及留養。古語云：「救人一命，勝造七級浮屠」這不是老生常談，我們推已及人，當救濟這一羣嗷嗷待哺的孤兒，直接改少街頭孤雛，間接爲國家蓄養一份元氣，本校校長曁職敎同人及全體兒童，困感到救濟孤兒的迫切需要，是以不嫌微薄，謹將節省糖果費三百元三角捐送貴報請即捐助孤兒敎養機關，雖杯水車薪，但也稍盡吾人一點責任。」（按款已收到謝謝。並　各界源源輸將，俾到達十萬元目標。）</p>
<h3>三位小學生　同情蘇益之</h3>
<p>（來函）閱報知平涼路聖心中小學蘇益之先生，被無理家長嚴辱憤恨而死，中心惋惜，非方可宣。茲將糖果費二百二十元，懇徐子長先生帶奉轉致，蘇先生家屬，並盼全市小朋友熱心解　，俾積少成多，共襄善舉。新寰中小學學生徐貴珍徐金根徐貴萍敬啓（按小友節省零用積成二百二十元，用以敬贈蘇先生家屬，尊重師道殊爲難得。）</p>
<p>又一羣小學生來函：「聖心小學的蘇益之先生因受學生家長無理的侮辱，氣憤而死，我們看到了這段消息，心裏有無限的難受。蘇先生是教導學生的良師，爲了希望學生的上進，鼓勵學生的努力，對於學生稍加懲罰，原是一件很平常的事。現在不幸反遭非命，我們做學生的人沒有一個不悲傷的。我們覺得蘇先生的死，在表面上看來，是死在不講情理的家長手裏。可是仔細一想，殺蘇先生唯一的劊子手，却是那個頑皮的劉姓小友，因爲如果那位劉姓小友是一個好學生，能接受老師的敎導，那末也決不會發生這種不幸的事來。所以我們敬告全市的小學生，今後必需努力學好，聽從教師的敎導，痛下決心做個好學生，來紀念這位爲敎育而犧牲的蘇益之先生。」</p>

<h3>The Increasingly Serious Problem of Civil Servants' Livelihood</h3>
<p>If the success or failure of all national policies ultimately depends on the people who implement them – the so-called "governing people" – then special attention should be paid to the livelihood of civil servants at all levels who actually implement national policies. Because the stability of civil servants' lives, whether directly or indirectly, affects their actual work. And the most noteworthy aspect of civil servants' lives is their material well-being. Specifically, it concerns the issues of clothing, food, and housing for civil servants. As the saying goes, "When clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and shame." If the material life of every civil servant cannot be resolved, then the cunning may exploit their official position for personal gain, while the loyal, though able to maintain integrity, are constantly troubled by the sighs of their families, and their minds are filled with worries about clothing, food, and firewood. It is difficult to expect them to dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to public service and achieve good results. So, has the livelihood of civil servants in general become a problem now? First, let's take Shanghai as an example to look at the trend of the cost of living index in recent years. According to the first half of the "Shanghai Economic Yearbook" published in May of this year, the price index of daily necessities for Japanese residents in Shanghai is as follows:</p>
<p>1936 Total Average: 100.00</p>
<p>1939 Total Average: 158.14</p>
<p>1941 Total Average: 338.59</p>
<p>January 1943 Total Average: 478.84</p>
<p>1938 Total Average: 128.59</p>
<p>1940 Total Average: 282.07</p>
<p>1942 Total Average: 401.60</p>
<p>February 1943 Total Average: 492.22</p>
<p>The trend of the cost of living index for salaried Chinese workers is as follows:</p>
<p>Let's look at the cost of living index for general laborers, as shown in the following table: (With the average index in the winter month of 1936 as 100, the index from March 1942 onwards is calculated in Central Reserve Bank notes)</p>
<p>Although there are no publicly available figures for this year's cost of living index to rely on, practical experience shows that since the Lunar New Year, general prices have risen by more than one-third to one-half. Since the abolition of the material movement restriction measures in March, rice prices have significantly decreased, and soap prices have also fallen significantly. However, in reality, the prices of general daily necessities have not only failed to fall accordingly but have instead continued to rise, especially clothing, miscellaneous items, and oils. Recently, with the doubling of the price of flour rationed to households and the increase in other official prices, such as cooking oil, public utilities such as streetcar and bus fares, and the prices of limited-price goods, although we have seen some companies and stores advertising at low prices, in reality, the prices of general necessities for the people have increased by at least one-third since the Lunar New Year of this year. Now, let's assume the cost of living for a family of five is calculated (two meals a day, three bowls of rice per person per meal):</p>
<p>The above does not include the necessary expenses for normal life such as transportation costs, clothing costs, children's miscellaneous expenses, education costs, medical expenses, social expenses, legitimate entertainment expenses, and newspaper expenses, and it is necessary to handle cooking and miscellaneous tasks oneself. Otherwise, even with a monthly salary of three thousand yuan, it would probably not be as satisfactory as a monthly salary of eighty yuan in 1936! However, how many civil servants now have a salary as high as three thousand yuan? We would like to ask the authorities to pay attention to this increasingly serious problem of livelihood. Needless to say, every civil servant understands the hardships of wartime, but at the same time, the minimum standard of living must be fully maintained. It is rumored that the government will implement a system of payment in kind, which is naturally a very timely and good system, but it seems that it cannot be realized for the time being. So, the only solution to the current problem is to increase salaries and allowances. As for the increase standard, first, it must be increased proportionally based on the actual cost of living index in each region. Second, pay attention to the intensity of work, the effectiveness of work, and the spirit of serving the public. Third, pay special attention to providing special subsidies for civil servants with too many children and especially heavy family burdens; but equally important, political efficiency must be improved. While increasing salaries, "streamlining administration" must be implemented. Unnecessary redundant agencies must be abolished and merged. Redundant personnel and sinecures who do not work, are unwilling to work, or are ineffective in their work must be dismissed. In this way, government agencies can save unnecessary expenses and use them for necessary expenditures to meet the material needs of civil servants, thereby increasing administrative efficiency. This is indeed the main principle of wartime governance. The treatment of civil servants and employees of private enterprises differs slightly in nature. Generally speaking, government agencies can determine their expenditures based on their income when necessary, while private enterprises can only determine their income based on their expenditures. Therefore, it is easier to improve the treatment of civil servants. Moreover, the current reality is that the treatment of civil servants is not as good as that of employees of private enterprises. In order to improve administrative efficiency and implement wartime national policies, we will not hesitate to repeatedly appeal for improving the livelihood of civil servants. We dare to reiterate that if the increasingly serious problem of civil servants' lives is not resolved quickly and properly, it will be a major obstacle to the implementation of all the government's good policies.</p>

Especially regarding the security of North China, due to the continuous efforts of both China and Japan, the bandits and communists are gradually being suppressed, and the situation is improving day by day. Furthermore, the general economic construction situation in North China is better than what I heard in Tokyo, which is deeply gratifying. Due to the limited time, I was unable to go to Zhangjiakou this time, but Minister Iwasaki and others came to Beiping to report on the various situations in Zhangjiakou.

<h3>North China Counties' Garrison Troops Reorganized into Security Teams</h3>
<p>Beijing, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The North China Political Affairs Committee of the National Government previously merged the General Headquarters for Strengthening Security Movement and the Anti-Communist Committee to establish the North China Anti-Communist Committee, with Zhu Shen concurrently serving as the chairman of the committee. At the same time, branch offices were established in various places to unify the anti-communist organization. In order to strengthen the connection between the local security teams and the central government, the Standing Committee of the Political Affairs Committee has now re-deliberated and resolved the Provisional Rules for the Formation of Security Teams, reorganized and strengthened the county garrison teams in various counties, renamed them Security Teams, and placed them under the direct command of the Anti-Communist Committee. The rules have been decided and will be promulgated and implemented soon. The main points of this reorganization of the county garrison teams into Security Teams are to unify command and strengthen strength. Previously, the county garrison teams were under the command and jurisdiction of the provincial police departments. Because the command strategies of each province were different, the liaison between provinces was also lacking. In order to remedy this shortcoming, the overall command authority is now assigned to the Anti-Communist Committee. The Director-General of the Security Administration, Qi Bian 氏, serves as the Commander-in-Chief of Security, the provincial governors serve as the Commanders of Security, the Tao Yins serve as the Commanders of Security, and the county magistrates serve as the Chiefs of the County Security Teams. In this way, the security organization and the administrative organization have become integrated. It is reported that the North China Anti-Communist Committee has launched active work since its establishment in April. The armed organizations of the people have also been gradually prepared. It is truly expected that the future security of North China will become better and better.</p>
<h3>Zhenqing Township Office Announces the Truth About the Conflict Between the Chongqing Communists</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Since the start of the township cleansing work in the Zhenjiang area, the conflict and friction between the Chongqing Communists has become increasingly fierce.

The Jiangsu-Southern puppet New Fourth Army was once surrounded. Luo Zhaochang, the chief of the 16th Brigade, and the political commissar both died in this conflict. During this conflict, the 16th Brigade also seized firearms and weapons from the puppet Loyalty and National Salvation Army and subsequently issued a so-called "Announcement to Jiangnan Compatriots and Friendly Forces" calling for unity against Japan and informing them of the truth about the friendly forces' cleansing and suppression.

<h3>Expert Commentary on the Japanese Army's Operations in Mainland China</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Experts here have expressed the following views on the Japanese army's operations in mainland China and the impact on the Chongqing side: After the Japanese Central China Army launched the Jiangnan Campaign in early May in the area near Dongting Lake to Yichang 対, it has completely achieved its operational objectives and reaped great combat results. As a result, the Chongqing army abandoned 36,000 corpses and 5,000 were captured, giving the Chongqing anti-Japanese camp a great blow. The operations of the Japanese China Expeditionary Force this year, with Central China and North China echoing each other, are very active. From mid-February to mid-March this year, the Japanese army launched the Central China Spring Offensive in the Su-Huai area of Central China and the area north of Dongting Lake, destroying the Chongqing army's "118th Division," "89th Army," Jiangbei Advance Army, and the Communist New Fourth Army. In mid-April, the Taihang Operation was launched in the Jin-Ji-Yu provincial area of North China, attacking the Chongqing 24th Army Corps and destroying the Communist 18th Army Corps. In mid-May, the Jiangnan Summer Offensive was launched in Central China, inflicting a great blow on the Chongqing Sixth War Area. The above three operations are the main operations launched by the Japanese army in mainland China at the beginning of this year. From these operations, one can understand the characteristics of the Chongqing strike-reduction operation. At the beginning of this year, the National Government's participation in the war and Japan's return of leased territories to China have brought Sino-Japanese relations into a new stage. The Chongqing side has lost its anti-Japanese purpose and is shaken. This has had a great impact on the Chongqing army's generals and frontline soldiers, making their anti-Japanese consciousness extremely low. The number of prisoners and surrenders is increasing day by day, far exceeding the number of abandoned corpses. Moreover, there is a surge in the number of those who have left the Chongqing anti-Japanese camp to join the National Government camp. General Pang Bingxun, the commander of the only Chongqing direct-line army, the 24th Army Corps in North China, and Sun Dianying have led more than 70,000 of their subordinates to join the National Government camp, which is causing Chongqing great distress. At the same time, since the National Government army's participation in the war, it has cooperated with the Japanese army in combat and has shown a high speed of combat power on all fronts, which is of great help to the National Government's implementation of political power. As the Chongqing army's combat power declines, it will gradually collapse, and its increasingly deep distress can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Central China Captures Ten Fortress Guns</h3>
<p>Hankou, 3rd (Central News Agency) – In the Summer Offensive launched by the Japanese army in Central China this time, the Japanese army drove deep into Changyang Pianyan and other important areas of the Chongqing Sixth War Area, attacking the solid positions built by the Chongqing army in the area and capturing six fortress guns. On the 24th, the Japanese army unit that was chasing the Chongqing 18th Division on the opposite bank of Yichang also seized four similar fortress guns near Mount Tai and captured a large number of shells. These fortress guns were originally set up by the Chongqing army to guard against the Japanese army's upstream operations, but due to the Japanese army's extremely rapid use of troops in this Summer Offensive, the Chongqing army was caught off guard and the fortress guns were captured by the Japanese army. The gun bodies have been unloaded and transported to a certain place. The Chongqing army has always felt that there were not enough fortress guns, and the loss of ten such large guns this time has been a great blow to them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Southern Hebei Encircles and Attacks Chongqing Communist Army</h3>

<h3>Minister Zhou's Talk with Japanese Reporters: Current Policies of the National Government</h3>
<p>(Nanjing Special Dispatch from Hobart on the 24th) This reporter met with Zhou Fohai, Deputy President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of the National Government, at the Yingbingguan at noon on the 24th. Mr. Zhou gave a very detailed and clear explanation of the National Government's firm belief in dealing with the current world situation and its policies on important issues:</p>
<p>(1) The Dissolution of the Soviet Union International Communist Party is said to be one of the results of the Washington talks between the British and American leaders. This is a gesture to strengthen the political cooperation between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, and to provide effective propaganda against the Axis powers. Although the International Communist Party is nominally dissolved, this does not mean the dissolution of communist parties in various countries or the abandonment of the world revolution policy of communism. The guidance and liaison with communist parties in various countries will not change much from before, due to the communist parties engaging in secret work. Therefore, the relationship with the Chinese Communist Party will also not undergo major changes. Regarding the development plan for the four northern routes, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union may have reached a temporary compromise.</p>
<p>(2) China's determination and belief in responding to the current world war situation is to vigorously promote the established policy, to cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War, and to move towards strengthening its war capabilities. Not long ago, he inspected Manchukuo and North China and felt even more the need to increase production and integrate the mainland economy organically. The development of heavy industry in Manchukuo is truly amazing and worthy of reference. Regarding the integration of Central and North China, he also had thorough discussions with Chinese and Japanese leaders during his visit to Beijing. In the future, policies in various aspects will be implemented one by one, and the fundamental issue to be resolved first is the currency unification of the Joint Reserve Bank notes and the Reserve Bank notes. Regarding the food problem in North China, flour and miscellaneous grains are being urgently transported from Central China. Comprehensive cooperation to relieve the people's livelihood in North China. The material exchange plan between Central and North China for the 32nd year of the Republic of China has already been agreed upon and will be implemented and operated under the control of the Trade Control Commission. As for the settlement of the aforementioned transaction balance, it has been decided to set up a credit loan of several hundred million yuan between the Reserve Bank and the Joint Reserve Bank, and it is expected that an agreement can be signed with the Joint Reserve Bank representative soon.</p>
<p>(3) The second half of the decisive battle for finance will begin on July 1, and it is expected to increase by about 70-80% compared to the previous period. The budget is currently being rushed. As more and more Yu army troops join the peace camp, military spending has increased significantly. Also, due to rising prices, it is necessary to increase the salaries of civil and military officials, so the budget has to be large. Part of the salary increase for civil and military officials will be in the form of in-kind payments. As a result of the progress of the "clearing the countryside" work, the income from land tax in local taxes is increasing rapidly. In the future, it is planned to change direct taxes such as land tax into central taxes, and the central government will provide financial subsidies to local governments.</p>
<p>(4) The 5th National Defense Conference on May 20 placed the General Commercial Control Association directly under the Executive Yuan. Although administrative supervision has been further enhanced, no new administrative organs will be established in the Executive Yuan. In practice, the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Food will still carry out the supervision of affairs. On the other hand, the Materials Control Review Committee, a consulting and deliberative body, has established a new secretariat to strengthen the administrative structure in order to plan more carefully for Sino-Japanese cooperation activities.</p>
<p>(5) After the completion of the entire structure of the Trade Control Commission and the restoration of economic circulation, a plan will be actively implemented to devote all efforts to the revival of industrial production in Shanghai. In terms of production, various aspects of assistance policies such as obtaining raw materials and financing production funds are being researched, but no new organization such as the Trade Control Commission will be established. If the material exchange and production increase between Shanghai and the inland can be realized, then the material exchange and economic integration with North China will be easier to carry out, and economic attacks on the Chongqing area will also become possible. By grasping the hearts of the people through the economy, a path to complete peace will be opened, and at the same time, the economic integration of China and Japan will be realized to confront the productive power of Britain and the United States, and to complete the Greater East Asia War.

<h3>Remarkable Military and Political Achievements in Burma in the Past Year</h3>
<p>(Rangoon, 3rd, Central News Agency) It has been exactly one year since the Japanese army pacified Burma last year and promulgated military administration on June 3. In this year, the rapid development of Burma has been truly amazing. Today's Burma? has become a powerful wing of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and is cooperating with all its national strength to complete the Greater East Asia War. Mr. Motoshige Osako, Minister of Political Affairs of the Military Administration Headquarters, gave a speech on the 2nd to explain the achievements of Burma since the implementation of military administration one year ago. The main points are recorded as follows: Burma has made rapid progress in the year since the implementation of military administration. The military administration has been able to establish administrative institutions and penetrate political power into various regions thanks to the sincere cooperation of Chief Minister Ba Maw and the heads of various departments of the Executive Government. The work of unifying domestic public opinion has been steadily progressing since the establishment of the Dobama Asiayone Party. Burma lacked national unity during the British rule, and this is now gradually being corrected. The new Burma will be a nation of ethnic harmony, and its nation-building work is now ready. Security is also very solid. However, it is currently necessary to strengthen the local police, reform the police administration, and cultivate outstanding talents to be sent to various places to serve in order to ensure security. In addition, the work of industrial development and revitalization is also progressing very smoothly. At the same time, the restoration of transportation agencies and the construction of railways, roads, and bridges have achieved great results thanks to the enthusiastic cooperation of the residents. Burma's industry is mainly based on rice. The authorities have taken various measures to purchase, distribute, store, and prevent the decline of rice production. At present, the authorities have established official prices and standard prices for daily necessities in order to stabilize them. In terms of education, 50 Japanese language schools are planned to be opened in various parts of Burma this year, and 10 Japanese language teachers dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of Education will arrive here soon. Vocational education, seaman training schools, and shipwright training schools have also been established, with the Maritime Affairs Bureau as the center, providing the necessary education. After the establishment of the two general bureaus of telecommunications and postal administration, the work of telecommunications and postal administration has been progressing smoothly. In terms of health, the activities of the volunteer rescue team and the establishment of private hospitals have gradually enriched the medical field. It is expected that infectious diseases such as cholera, plague, and malaria will be reduced after the Burmese people's knowledge of health is improved. One thing that deserves our attention the most is that the Burmese people have resolutely risen up under the fierce air raids by enemy aircraft and have begun to organize civil defense work. On December 13 of last year, defense liaison committees were established in various defense areas. At present, volunteer fire brigades, self-help rescue teams, air defense surveillance teams, railway and road protection teams, and aircraft field oil pipeline guard groups are organized throughout the country. These defense organizations are responsible by the Baojia and village chiefs, and the youth class is the center of the organization. Burma has lacked popular organizations in the past, so the people are very interested in new organizations and are happy to participate, which will surely make a great contribution to the construction of Burma. To sum up the achievements of Burma in the year since the implementation of military administration, Burma has become a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and has established a war system to cooperate with Japan to overthrow Britain and the United States. At the same time, on this basis, it focuses on establishing the domestic system of Burma and revitalizing people's livelihood work and moving forward.</p>
<h3>U.S. Coal Mine Strike Wave Expands War Labor Board Orders Suspension of Negotiations Military Industry Already Suffering Serious Impact</h3>
<p>(Lisbon, 3rd, Central News Agency) According to news received here last night: The large-scale strike wave in the American coal industry has begun to spread to the miners of the American Federation of Labor in the coal mines of Illinois. The War Labor Board in Washington yesterday ordered that negotiations to resolve the strike be suspended until the striking workers return to work. The War Labor Board telegraphed the mine owners and John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, which is affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, accusing the strike of being "an unjustified violation of the no-strike pledge" and emphasizing that the Labor Board would not recognize agreements made under coercion. The telegram also stated that the board had submitted the matter to President Roosevelt and asked him to take necessary measures. Mine owners and unions have complied with this order and have postponed their wage meetings until 2 pm. Neither side made any comment. Yesterday afternoon, President Roosevelt specially summoned Secretary of the Interior Ickes and members of the War Labor Board to the White House to discuss the strike situation. At the same time, the wave of coal mine shutdowns yesterday spread to five coal mines in Gillespie, Illinois, which employ 2,200 members of the Progressive Mine Workers Union, which is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, which had formally refused to participate in the national strike. American newspapers are still paying great attention to the strike, with headlines such as "The most serious crisis in the United States since the start of the war" and "The strike of 500,000 coal miners poses a serious threat to American military industry." According to the latest news from Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky, almost all the miners affiliated with the United Mine Workers of America, led by Lewis, have gone on strike, but coal production has not completely stopped, as some miners are not affiliated with any organization. President Roosevelt, in order to confirm his argument that striking miners are traitors, has asked the Department of Labor to release figures on the losses suffered by military production due to the strike. According to this statistic, the impact of the strike on the amount of military supplies produced last month was more serious than in any month since the start of the war. The loss of working hours was greater than in any month. In April, 675,000 workdays were lost, but in May, strikes in coal mines, the Chrysler factory, and the Akron rubber industry in Ohio broke out one after another, and the losses exceeded those of April. It was also revealed that the strike caused the American military industry to lose 2,250,000 tons of bituminous coal and 103,000 tons of anthracite coal every day. The copper and iron industry, power plants, and railways are particularly threatened by the miners' strike. If the strike continues, passenger traffic on the railways will be further restricted. Secretary of the Interior Ickes has once again asked Lewis to end the strike as soon as possible. Ickes, who also serves as fuel administrator, said that Lewis should be primarily responsible for the strike, and that some mine owners' firm refusal to compromise is tantamount to adding fuel to the fire. In this regard, it is now known that the miners are willing to accept a daily wage increase of $1.50 without insisting on their previous demand for a daily increase of $2, but insist that this wage increase should be retroactive to April 1. However, the mine owners refuse this request.</p>
<h3>Bevin's Important Position in British War Cabinet</h3>
<p>(Geneva, 3rd, Central News Agency) The German news agency reported from London that, according to the New Statesman, Prime Minister Churchill's recent visit to the United States was on the advice of British Minister of Labour Bevin, who now occupies a very important position in the British Cabinet. According to the report, when Churchill fell ill at the beginning of this year, the question arose as to who would succeed him if Churchill were to die. At that time, it was agreed that if Churchill died, Bevin should succeed him as Prime Minister.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Milne Bay</h3>

<h3>New Weapons in Japanese War Science (5)</h3>
<p>Ultra-Shortwave Warning Device</p>
<p>At a distance of two or three hundred li, in the sky beyond the reach of sight, powerful radio waves are emitted towards enemy aircraft, and reflection immediately occurs from the aircraft's body, and the radio waves return to their origin, so the enemy aircraft's location cannot be concealed. In the sky, above the hearing range, thick clouds cover the Japanese mainland. If enemy aircraft come to attack, as soon as they touch this powerful radio wave net, they will be detected, and the base's fighters can take off to intercept them. In the vast darkness, anti-aircraft gun positions can fire accurate artillery fire at invisible targets, forming a fire net—the "Ultra-Shortwave Warning Device" was prepared for the next Greater East Asia War. After ten years of hard research in radio wave warfare, Japanese scientific warriors completely succeeded in their research just before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, achieving a thousand-year-lasting war record.</p>
<p>The inventor is Lieutenant Colonel Sakae Inaba of the 5th Technical Research Institute of the Army, who was also awarded an award this time. The following is his talk—</p>
<p>The sky is so vast, and the position occupied by an aircraft in the sky is so small. Is it really possible to emit radio waves from a very long distance towards such a small target and get its reflection? This fundamental question has been the subject of discussion in Japanese scientific circles for fifteen or sixteen years. In the following years, it was linked to the question of generating ultra-short waves of great power, and more in-depth research was conducted. In order to adapt to the progress of world aviation tactics, we finally began to manufacture this weapon ourselves. This was in Showa 15, before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, it became clear from enemy weapons captured from various places that countries around the world had spent a lot of research on the invention of this weapon since before the war.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the project, it was already known that even for such a small aircraft, if a radio wave is emitted towards it, the radio wave can generate a fairly strong reflection. In our continued research, we saw the reflected image of the aircraft in flight using television technology, so we researched how to apply that phenomenon. At the same time, we applied the principle of measuring the state of the ionosphere in the air, which changes with the seasons and times, in shortwave communications, and used these two methods to measure the time from the emission of the radio wave to its reflection back, and then accurately measure the distance, direction, and position of aircraft that were not yet visible, and we succeeded. This is the "Ultra-Shortwave Warning Device" that is now used to detect aircraft at long distances. An "Ultra-Shortwave Ranging Device" used to detect relatively short distances with particularly high precision was also successfully developed at the same time.</p>
<p>This success is of course not due to the power of my individual, but to the collective wisdom collected over ten years of basic research, and the cooperation of all parties. In particular, it cannot be forgotten that Dr. Masaji Kobayashi (currently an employee of Sumitomo Electric Industries), who was also commended this time, gave great help.</p>
<p>Our country was behind in this research, so when we started manufacturing, we had to start with trial manufacturing of transmitting tubes and receiving tubes. Also, in order to keep the research secret, the intention of these experimental materials could not be understood by private manufacturing companies. Therefore, even the companies did not know how important this was in terms of combat power, and did not know how many times they held anxious thoughts about this research. During this period, Dr. Kobayashi worked very hard and continued his research without taking a moment's break. Shortly after completion, the war broke out, and this weapon was immediately prepared in various places, adding new power to our solid air defense front. Even compared with captured weapons, its precision and performance are not inferior to any British or American weapons. When I think of the mission of defending the East Asian sky in this holy war, the hard work of Dr. Kobayashi cannot be repaid in words. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, April 21)</p>

<h3>Kuban Bridgehead German Defensive Battle Progressing Smoothly Soviet Large-Scale Offensive Again Thwarted German Aircraft Groups Bomb Kursk</h3>
<p>(Berlin, 3rd, Central News Agency) The German Führer Headquarters announced that the German army on the eastern line of the Kuban River bridgehead is continuing to conduct fierce defensive battles. The German army concentrated its firepower and finally thwarted the enemy's attempt to break through the German army. The German army often thwarts enemy attacks before they are launched. The success of this defensive battle is also due to the strong participation of German aircraft. In other battlefields on the eastern front, German shock troops destroyed countless enemy ambush sites, and the Soviet army suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>(Stockholm, 3rd, Central News Agency) The third day of operations in the Kuban region began again on the morning of the 1st after the German army launched an offensive. The Soviet army was attracted by the German army's diversionary offensive, carried out a fierce counterattack, and the battle situation became more favorable to the German army. The Soviet army launched a stubborn breakthrough operation with about six divisions of snipers from five tank brigades. However, they were surrounded and annihilated by the German army everywhere. Now the German army has achieved great results. The battle situation in various regions is summarized as follows: (1) The main force of the Soviet offensive was concentrated in the west of Kuryumsyk, and about 200 tanks were used as pioneers to forcibly attack the German positions. However, within a few minutes of the start of the battle, 58 tanks were lost, and only 22 tanks succeeded in breaking through. However, this tank army was attacked by German anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns on the road from Kuryumsyk to Moldapensk, and was almost completely destroyed. (2) The German and Soviet armies also launched fierce tank battles in the marshland northwest of Kuryumsk. As of the afternoon of the 1st, the Soviet army had lost 24 tanks. The situation on this front has not been clarified due to the lack of accurate reports. (3) In order to attack the German positions at the entrance of the Taman Peninsula, the Soviet army attempted to land one division of snipers north of Delyuk, but only one battalion succeeded in landing. After suffering a fatal blow, the main force of the Soviet army was repulsed. The landed Soviet troops were also surrounded by the German army and will be annihilated soon. In addition, the German authorities attached great importance to the battle in the Velibao area northwest of Smolensk on the central front, saying that the Soviet army had stopped the frontal offensive on Smolensk and launched a roundabout operation from the west. Also, after the Soviet army dispatched reinforcements from the Velikerki area on the 1st, they launched attacks on the German positions in the Usvyat and Illinois areas all day long, but suffered heavy blows and fled north. The battle has now come to a close. Local offensives by the Soviet army on other fronts were very active, but they were only reconnaissance battles in nature and were repulsed immediately after being fiercely fired on by the German artillery team. In addition, the German authorities announced on the 2nd that the German army on the eastern front shot down 51 Soviet aircraft on the 1st.</p>
<p>(Moscow, 3rd, Central News Agency) According to a broadcast here on the 3rd: The German Air Force used a large group of 100 aircraft to bomb the city of Kursk and its railway facilities five times in a row, seriously damaging Soviet troops and their military facilities.</p>
<h3>Pope's Speech Denounces Inhumane Bombing</h3>
<p>(Vatican City, 3rd, Central News Agency) Pope Pius XII delivered a speech to the cardinals yesterday, reviewing the unprecedented war and the possibility of peace. He briefly stated that the Church is prepared to assist the people of the world, its most important mission is to protect the spiritual heritage, and he pointed out the errors of increasing various sins. They do not want to accuse others, but will lead humanity towards the path of reason. The decree does not discriminate against any nation. In the current war, he has tried his best to make the belligerent countries respect the laws of humanity in air warfare. War cannot produce a just peace, but peace-loving people will certainly be able to do their best to build a new world at the appropriate time, and all countries will heal the wounds of war and move forward hand in hand. The Church believes that this spirit is still lacking at present, and he calls on Catholics to pray together.</p>
<p>(Rome, 3rd, Central News Agency) According to the decision of the Washington Conference, the Allied forces are engaged in harassing the rear of the Axis forces, especially carrying out inhumane blind bombing on the Italian mainland, harming innocent civilians, and bombing monasteries, seminaries, and churches. On the 2nd, the anniversary of his inauguration, the Pope pointed out that the methods of combat are becoming increasingly fierce with the progress of the war, and it seems that there is no distinction between so-called military targets. Now, not only are individual citizens being harmed, but the entire nation is being threatened. Since the beginning of the European War, the Church has tried its best to ask the belligerent countries to respect and maintain all the rules of humanity during air raids. This is the duty that the Church owes to humanity. According to news from Italian telegrams, the attitude of the news media in Britain and the United States towards the blind bombing of the Italian mainland by the Allied air forces is obviously opposed. British officials and the news media, including Churchill, advocate inhumane blind bombing as a method of warfare, while the American news censorship authorities, considering that Catholics will interfere in the presidential election in the future, are severely cracking down on news about the Allied air force's blind bombing of the Italian mainland and cities.</p>
<h3>Halifax Claims War Will Be Prolonged</h3>
<p>(Lisbon, 3rd, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>A telegram from Washington stated: British Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax warned reporters in Portland yesterday not to easily believe the propaganda that the war will end quickly, and said that the Allied countries may not be inactive in the European theater for a long time, but the war is likely to be long and difficult.</p>
<h3>British and American Ship Losses: 32 Million Tons</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Naval circles here claim that since the outbreak of war, the total number of ships lost by Britain and the United States is approximately 32,000,000 tons. In other words, the tonnage they have lost exceeds the total tonnage of their merchant fleets at the beginning of the war. The total number of cargo ships currently owned by Britain and the United States is feared to be less than 21,000,000 tons, a decrease of approximately 10,000,000 tons compared to September 1, 1939. Because the American shipbuilding industry is actively underway, the aforementioned situation is particularly noteworthy. Over the past 45 months, Britain and the United States have consistently failed to overcome the threat of German submarines, and it will inevitably be the same in the future. In May of this year, the anti-Axis forces lost 500,000 registered gross tons of ships, or 750,000 tons of deadweight tonnage. Since January 1943, a total of 3,400,000 registered gross tons of anti-Axis ships have been sunk by the Japanese, German, and Italian air and naval forces. As for the large number of ships sunk due to hitting mines or being damaged at sea, they are not included in the above figures.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Navy Attacks Pantelleria Island, Repelled by Italian Artillery; Germans Improve Defenses in Eastern Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Rome, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters announced on the 2nd that anti-Axis naval forces attacked Pantelleria Island, located between Tunisia and Sicily, on the afternoon of the 1st. The island's Italian artillery immediately counterattacked, heavily damaging one enemy destroyer, and the other ships and vessels immediately fled.</p>
<p>Beunos Aires, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Stamford in the New York Times: Japanese army and navy experts, along with technical personnel, have arrived in the Middle East to inspect the defenses constructed by the German army in the eastern Mediterranean. The Japanese delegation is led by a senior active-duty naval officer and has visited Crete, Salamis, Lemnos, and the Greek coast. The German side has also improved defenses in accordance with the recommendations of Japanese experts.</p>

<h3>Egyptian Cabinet Reorganization</h3>
<p>Cairo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - It was announced last night that the Egyptian cabinet has been reorganized. Minister of Public Health and Acting Minister of Social Affairs, Edian, has been appointed as Minister of the Interior. Previously, this position was concurrently held by Prime Minister Nahas. Now, in addition to serving as Prime Minister, Nahas remains the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Osman has been appointed as Minister of Finance, and former Minister of Social Affairs, Haq, has been appointed as Minister of Agriculture.</p>
<h3>Tasks of the German Social Party's Security Team</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) - News: Newkatchen, leader of the German Social Party's Black Shirt Guards, published an article in the German Review yesterday, giving the first public discussion of the activities and tasks of the National Socialist Party's security team. It is claimed that the team is generated by the National Socialist Party and has close ties with the German police and secret police. The team members are administrative experts, scientists, teachers, and economic experts, all of whom are given political warfare work. This organization was first disclosed in newspapers in 1940, when some of the team's leaders captured two British spies near Venlo on the Dutch border. Currently, the team is very active in the rear, and its task is to protect residents. The team is part of the German secret police, so it has its own propaganda department, which is the same as the German army.</p>

<h3>Selected Translations of Current Events: Difficulties in Training American Naval and Air Forces</h3>
<p>(Report from Lisbon, Yoshimitsu Special Correspondent, 28th) The United States boasts of building 7,000 aircraft per month and four merchant ships per day. If this is true, then perhaps the huge amount of aircraft and merchant ships that the United States loses in the Atlantic and Pacific every day can be replenished. However, although they have abundant resources, they suffer from a shortage of manpower. Moreover, in the naval aspect, long-term training is even more necessary. Therefore, Britain and the United States are currently desperately training and replenishing naval personnel and aircrews.</p>
<p>(1) The Problem of Massively Training Aircrews</p>
<p>The most urgent problem for the U.S. Navy is the mass rapid training of aircrews. Since the Pearl Harbor incident, the United States has tried its best to avoid direct confrontation with the Japanese fleet and attempted a long-term Pacific war centered on the air force. After the outbreak of the Japanese-American war, the U.S. Navy established a plan for a large air force of 27,500 aircraft and, at the same time, planned to supply 30,000 pilots to the front lines every year. The United States gathered experts from various warships and organized a "Naval Aviator Training Corps" as a guiding organization. However, this huge plan is obviously difficult to implement.</p>
<p>To train a pilot so that they can go into front-line combat requires at least 250 hours or more of training flight time. Assuming a student diligently practices with 100 hours of flight time per month, the results are still not necessarily excellent. Also, if an instructor trains six students, it is common for two of them to fail. That is to say, one-third of the training time is wasted.</p>
<p>Due to the demand for rationalizing training, the U.S. Navy recently established the difficult-to-implement policy that "all those in flight training must graduate." However, experts who are actually in charge of pilot training regard this as an unreasonable requirement. In fact, according to the experience of the U.S. Army and Navy in training pilots, roughly 40 percent of students fail. So, what countermeasures are they taking? First, be strict in pre-assessment; second, increase the instructor's guidance efficiency.</p>
<p>Regarding the first item, the psychological testing of recruits is first restored. This testing is now carried out by the Human Resources Committee and the Conscription Bureau. Regarding the second item, the problem of increasing guidance efficiency, the instructor's guidance flight is unified and standardized. A special guidance organization is established by seven pilots. They tour training airfields across the country, test the flight skills of each instructor, and inspect their guidance ability.</p>
<p>The training procedure is that those who are selected as pilot candidates first enter the elementary course of a private flight training school. After passing the elementary training, they advance to the naval preparatory flight school, where they receive basic education as naval aircrew members. The quality of pilots is largely determined during this process. About seven months after starting flight, their qualification as a naval aircrew member is recognized.</p>
<p>The above is the procedure for the U.S. Navy to produce aircrew members one year ago. The ideal of training is that it should take more than seven months in terms of days and more than 250 hours in terms of flight time. However, in the current war where pilots are consumed in large quantities, there is no doubt whether those dispatched to the front lines have all undergone this ideal training. According to the American announcement, it is said that several thousand people enter the gates of naval flight training schools every month. If the graduation of new pilots who go to serve in the fleet after seven months is not liberally permitted, it will inevitably be inconsistent with the astronomical aircraft production rate. However, they are also paying the greatest attention to improving quality, aiming to achieve the highest degree of completion by this summer.</p>
<p>(2) The Problem of Replenishing Fleet Personnel</p>
<p>Since the Pearl Harbor incident, the American officers and sailors who shared the fate of countless sunken warships have naturally exceeded tens of thousands. In order to replenish and recruit sailors, they have promised huge salaries and various privileges to those who enlist in the Navy.</p>
<p>In peacetime, most people enlist as sailors because of this motivation, so there are often many desertions. When the U.S.-Japan crisis was rumored in 1936, there were particularly many deserters among American sailors. This was a headache for the U.S. Navy's leaders. During this war, this fact is of course no longer published, so the details are unknown. However, the character of American sailors has not changed, and it is feared that the situation of desertion has not disappeared today.</p>
<p>They have experienced the direct and indirect threat of the Japanese Navy and are unwilling to be thankless sailors again, instead wanting to join the high-profile air force, which is clear evidence. The Marine Corps, called Marines by sailors, is given special importance by the U.S. Navy in this war. The Marines, composed of particularly high-quality sailors, are selected from among the sailors, just like the naval landing forces in the Japanese Navy. It was this Marine Corps that landed on Guadalcanal. Hotels, dance halls, and bars on the coast of Miami have all been transformed into Marine dormitories and classrooms for the large-scale training of Marine units.</p>
<p>The clothing of officers is also something that the U.S. Navy finds a headache. The Naval Academy at Annapolis is a school famous for its wartime privileged class. The President, the Houses of Congress, and state governors all have the right to recommend a certain number of students to enter the Naval Academy. Therefore, most of the students at the school are darlings of the privileged class and stars of the social scene. Their education is also extremely rigorous.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, the education implemented in the school is quite severe, and more than 20% of those who enter usually fail. Once they enter the school, if it is determined that they are not suitable to be naval officers, then their relationship with military affairs ends there. In the current situation where the war is raging, will this rigorous education continue as before? Before the necessity of reality, this tradition may collapse! According to recent news, the gathering of students has increased rapidly. (Detailed translation from the May 29 issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Britain is Afraid</h3>
<p>The current stage of the European war, according to news reports, is a fierce bombing war between Germany, Italy, and Britain, but a strange reaction has been found in Britain.</p>
<p>The British authorities are touting to the public that the recent bombing of two industrial areas in Germany has been very effective. However, this bombing has produced two difficult results, and they are now very embarrassed. Because of an exaggerated propaganda by the authorities, a misleading psychological state fills the country. The British authorities are mobilizing media outlets to declare to the public: "The bombing has spread throughout German territory, inflicting heavy damage. Germany can no longer launch air raids on Britain. In order to hinder Germany's aggressive war, large-scale air raids are still necessary." Another strange phenomenon is that the damage to its own air force is too great. According to the British Minister of Aviation, speaking in the House of Commons, since January of this year, 699 aircraft have been lost and 4,600 pilots have been lost. Therefore, the loss rate has also increased with the years. In April alone, 280 were lost. What about May? We only need to look at the news of British aircraft being shot down constantly being reported to understand. For example, recently, when British aircraft bombed Telbermond, 44 aircraft and 350 pilots were lost. The number lost in this one month is staggering enough. It is only natural that there is domestic criticism for failing to inflict heavy damage on German military industries and instead suffering a fatal blow themselves.</p>
<p>However, on the one hand, Germany's retaliatory air raids have been very fierce. In particular, the new bombs recently used by Germany are amazingly powerful, and Britain feels greatly threatened, even letting out a lament. The German authorities are keeping silent about the performance of these bombs, still maintaining silence. Propaganda work does not need to imitate the self-praise of Britain and the United States. It can be expressed by the power of the bombs, allowing the enemy to experience its miraculous effect. It is better to save some propaganda effort and continue to bomb more. (Yun Peng: Translated from the May 29th Mainichi Shimbun editorial)</p>
<h3>The Washington Conference</h3>
<p>The Washington Conference, which lasted for half a month, only concluded on May 25. We have no way of knowing what the conclusion is, nor do we necessarily need to know its exact nature. However, propaganda organs, as usual, have various interesting reports.</p>
<p>Whether the news is true or not is another matter, but in any case, what the agenda is has long been clear. It has been repeatedly said that their first agenda item is whether the future center of operations should be placed in Europe or in the Pacific; the second agenda item is how to achieve a common front between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Of course, in addition to this, there are other issues subordinate to the war situation for discussion, but the most important issues are none other than the above two. It is said that the first agenda item has been concluded because Britain and the United States themselves do not contradict each other. Roughly speaking, the United States pays as much attention to the Pacific as possible, and Britain pays as much attention to Europe as possible. At least within this year, no large-scale offensive will be launched in East Asia. Recovering the Yunnan-Burma Road, etc., will not be attempted either. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall situation, for Chiang Kai-shek and the Soviet Union, who are fighting for Britain and the United States, Chiang Kai-shek's side will only suffer until Britain and the United States have enough resources to spare. As for the Soviet Union, it seems that there is an intention to provide aid from the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>In short, as a result of the Washington Conference, Roosevelt's political ideals did not benefit. There is no doubt that Churchill won. Because Roosevelt, who was single-handedly resisting the Japanese-German-Italian axis, wanted to pull Churchill to East Asia, but he did not succeed. Moreover, the meeting with Stalin has not yet been realized, and no concrete decision can be made between the two. We cannot believe the decisions of the other party reported by the news organs and should examine the contradictions in their reports ourselves.

<p>The Zhang Jinhai tragic death case has been delayed until now. The French Concession police did not prosecute the main culprits Guo Shiyuan, Li Xiuying, and Feng Quansheng. After the news was released, it once again aroused the indignation of all sectors of society. This morning (4th), the Second Special District Local Court of this city will reopen a public hearing. Yesterday, the Central News Agency reporter specifically inquired with the Dean of the Court, Chen Bingjun, about everything. It is said that the official indictment of the French Concession Police has now been delivered to the court. The criminal court decided to hold a public hearing this morning. In addition to officially prosecuting Zhu Songcheng and Wang Shu and the other four culprits, the French Concession Police have formally declared that they will not prosecute Guo Shiyuan, Li Xiuying, and Feng Quansheng. After investigating the case, the Procuratorate of this court held a hearing and concluded that Guo and others did have criminal acts. How can they be allowed to roam freely? Therefore, although the French Concession Police will not prosecute, in order to respect the law and protect the legal interests of the citizens in the concession, the Procuratorate of this court decided to file a public prosecution alone to maintain the national law and extend the law, etc. It is said that Shen Wenjie, the chief procurator of the court's procuratorate, is currently personally drafting the indictment, listing the facts of the crime. The entire draft was completed last night and will be directly delivered to the criminal court this morning when the court opens and a public prosecution is filed.</p>

<p>The Public Works Bureau Information Department announced: "According to the Shanghai West Financial Agreement signed by this bureau and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government on December 10 of the year before last, all taxation matters in the district have been transferred to the Municipal Finance Bureau's West Shanghai Office for handling. However, since its implementation, all other administrative affairs have not been resolved. Therefore, the two municipal authorities have often found it difficult to implement various administrative affairs in the district, especially those related to public health. In order to resolve the aforementioned difficulties, the two municipal authorities have held meetings since February of this year, jointly discussing solutions in the spirit of full cooperation and harmony. Now, the two parties have reached a complete understanding on all issues and signed the "Supplementary Agreement" at 10:00 AM on the 3rd (yesterday) in the bureau's conference hall.</p>

<h3>### Loss of Resident Certificates in Urban Areas; Replacements Issued After Six Months</h3>
<p>In order to ensure the stability of public order in the urban areas, the Municipal Police Bureau, acting on orders, processed and issued resident certificates for the urban area to prevent petty criminals from infiltrating the area and disturbing the peace. Since the issuance of these certificates, many citizens who have received them have failed to properly keep them, resulting in repeated losses, which is highly inappropriate. It is now learned that the allied gendarmerie has held discussions and decided that, in the future, if a resident certificate is lost, a replacement can only be applied for after six months, as a form of minor punishment.</p>
<h3>Automobile Fuel Rationing</h3>

<h3>### Mayor Chen Discusses Investigating Stockpiles and Suppressing Hoarding; Actively Preparing to Establish a Materials Investigation Committee</h3>
<p>Mayor Chen of this city, after being appointed as the concurrent Chairman of the Materials Investigation Committee, has actively been preparing for the committee's work. Yesterday, reporters paid a visit to Mayor Chen to inquire about everything, and he kindly shared the following remarks:</p>
<p>In wartime economics, the most important factors are increasing production and managing materials. Appropriate management particularly relies on suppressing hoarding and investigating stockpiles. Since the incident, Shanghai, a small area, has been flooded with speculative capital. Merchants, seizing the opportunity for profit, are all inclined to hoarding, resulting in abundant reserves of essential goods but very little circulation. Prices are rising daily, making life difficult for the people. If this continues, it will inevitably harm society on a small scale and affect the war effort on a large scale. The government, recognizing this, has first issued a clear order to suppress hoarding, strictly defining penalties to warn unscrupulous merchants and facilitate the flow of materials. Previously, special officials were dispatched to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation, the details of which have been reported in the press. At the same time, financial institutions have also been thoroughly investigated. On one hand, the Central Reserve Bank has recalled loans to reduce speculative capital in the market; on the other hand, it has strictly examined lending to prevent people from having the opportunity to hoard. Over the past month, learning from past mistakes and preventing future ones, the Materials Price Investigation Committee has been established. I, in my capacity as mayor, have been appointed as the concurrent Chairman of the committee, and the government has specially appointed senior officials and officials from allied nations to form the committee to work together and conduct separate investigations. If hoarding or manipulation is discovered, we will report it to the government for legal action. In this way, the quantity of material reserves will become clear, making appropriate allocation easier to implement in the future. Needs can be met without feeling scarcity, and prices can be lowered, aligning with the principles of wartime controlled economy.</p>
<h3>### Short Commentary: A Respectful Admonition to the French Authorities Regarding the Zhang Case</h3>
<p>The Zhang Jinhai case, which has caused a sensation throughout Shanghai and aroused widespread public indignation, has reached a point where, after the French Consul General Magre replied to Mayor Chen of Shanghai on May 12, admitting that French Concession Detective Miret had committed a crime, ordering his detention for legal action, compensating the Zhang family with a consolation payment of $100,000, expressing regret, and guaranteeing that future police officers would be strictly instructed not to engage in brutal behavior, the remaining perpetrators in the case were handed over to the Chinese courts for trial. The case could have ended there. We once said, "If the French authorities can value reason and act according to the law, it is still somewhat satisfactory." To be honest, the people of Shanghai, and indeed the Chinese people, have always possessed the virtues of patience and respect for friendship. However, they do not disregard justice. When the balance between justice and friendship is too skewed, they will also "become angry." The essence of the Zhang case is, of course, a social and legal event, but the reason it aroused such unified public indignation is that "the balance between justice and friendship was too skewed." After the French authorities made a formal statement, everyone believed that the balance between justice and friendship was approaching, and public indignation subsided under "somewhat satisfactory" endurance. We believe that the authorities of the French Concession will not fail to understand this key point.</p>
<p>However, the French Concession administrative authorities repeatedly requested postponements for the prosecution of the perpetrators in the Zhang case, claiming that the investigation was not yet complete. The Second Special Court has repeatedly and reluctantly granted these requests, and declared that today's court session cannot be postponed. However, the indictment formally delivered by the French Concession did not prosecute three of the perpetrators in the case. Although we are reluctant to say that the French authorities intentionally exonerated these individuals, after the Second Special Court Prosecutor's Office concluded its investigation, the facts were clear, and all those suspected of committing crimes should have been prosecuted according to the law. Do the French authorities believe that these three individuals had no criminal suspicion at all and therefore did not prosecute them? This is truly difficult to understand. The Chinese courts must conduct trials in accordance with the law and cannot bear the responsibility of "law enforcers violating the law."</p>
<p>We solemnly tell those in the French Concession authorities who are related to this case: be extremely cautious in handling this case according to the law, and do not act on impulse. Obey the constraints of the Sino-French Agreement and respect the dignity of Chinese law. These are the conditions that must be met.</p>
<h3>### Economic Commentary: The Economic Sector and Urgent Relief for North China</h3>
<p>The disaster situation in North China has reached an extreme level. Tens of millions of starving people awaiting relief are eagerly awaiting our urgent assistance to alleviate their suffering. Our industrial, commercial, and financial sectors are in a relatively better position and have more financial capacity. They feel an even greater sense of responsibility and cannot shirk their duty in the face of this tragic disaster. We believe that the following actions should be implemented by the economic sector as quickly as possible:</p>
<p>(1) All organizations engaged in industry and commerce should implement thrift measures and donate all normally dispensable expenses, such as those for alcohol and gifts, to North China disaster relief.</p>
<p>(2) In the future, when industrial, commercial, and financial sectors hold celebrations and birthdays, they should be especially thrifty, not prepare banquets, and donate all banquet expenses to North China disaster relief. (It is reported that Ren Jun of Wuhe Weaving Factory donated banquet expenses to relieve North China disaster victims upon the birth of his son, offering blessings to relatives and friends. The staff of Mengfu Clothing Company also transferred their Dragon Boat Festival banquet funds to aid relief efforts, which is worthy of emulation).</p>
<p>(3) The financial sector should first lend funds to the disaster relief association, prepare large sums of money, and quickly purchase miscellaneous grains to transport to North China for the starving people.</p>
<p>(4) The Commerce and Trade Association should consult with the Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association to discuss the steps for purchasing miscellaneous grains and engage in voluntary buying and selling to fulfill the responsibility of merchants to provide disaster relief.</p>
<p>(5) The industrial, commercial, and financial sectors should jointly select impartial individuals to go to North China to conduct a survey of the disaster situation, discuss overall relief measures, and work together with the Shanghai North China Urgent Relief Association to develop relief plans. Zhang Yunbo said, "Our responsibility for disaster relief at present is simply to act quickly." We hope that the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors will implement urgent relief efforts because the faster the relief is provided, the more lives will be saved.</p>
<h3>### After the Central Reserve Bank Takes Over the Silver Union Association Exchange, Measures for Clearing Check Exchange Differences</h3>
<p>In order to enhance the financial adjustment capacity of the Central Reserve Bank and enable general financial institutions to gradually adapt to national financial policies, the clearing of exchange differences for each bank in the Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Preparatory Committee Check Exchange will be transferred to the Central Reserve Bank, effective June 1st. The main points of the exchange are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) After the Joint Preparatory Committee Check Exchange completes the exchange clearing on May 31st of this year, it will transfer all remaining funds from the deposits of each exchange bank to the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank. The exchange clearing accounts of each bank will be used for the receipt and payment of exchange differences for each exchange bank after each day's exchange, starting from June 1st. The location of the daily exchange will remain at the Joint Preparatory Committee Exchange, and the content and original business of the exchange will not be changed. (2) If an exchange bank lacks sufficient funds in its exchange clearing deposit balance to pay the difference it owes that day and needs to supplement funds, it can either borrow from the Central Reserve Bank or, as in the past, borrow from the Joint Preparatory Committee Exchange, whichever is more convenient for the exchange bank. (3) The Joint Preparatory Committee Exchange, as of now, acts as an agent for collecting payments for each bank. The method for handling transactions entrusted by non-exchange banks will remain the same. For transactions entrusted by exchange banks, after receiving the funds, they should issue a Central Reserve Bank check. The entrusted bank should no longer have the opening of a deposit account with the exchange bank.</p>

<h3>### Public Life: The Life of a Shop Assistant in a Native Produce Store</h3>
<p>— Pei</p>
<p>Our group of shop assistants is also called "Sir" by the general public. Is this mostly because we are wearing a tattered long gown? Thinking about it makes me feel ashamed. Now, let me talk about our living conditions:</p>
<p>We all have to get up around 7 AM. After washing our faces and eating porridge, we sit on the counter like stone lions, waiting for customers. After 9 AM, the number of customers gradually increases, and we start to take the scales and move around the store, weighing goods. Some of us are tying paper bags at the counter. The boss, leisurely or vigilantly, sits at the accounting desk.</p>
<p>At 12 o'clock, it's lunchtime. Large stores have two separate mealtimes, while medium and small stores have only one, which is a bit pitiful! Before the rice can even enter our mouths, customers are already knocking on the counter. We have to stand up and do business with a mouthful of rice. If it's cold weather, we have to wait until business is slow to eat again, and the food is already cold. We can only wash it down with boiling water.</p>
<p>The afternoon is a bit slower, and stores with more relaxed rules allow everyone to sit for a while and read the newspaper. Stores with stricter rules have the boss watching with a displeased expression. You're afraid of being seen as lazy, so you have to stand from morning to night. We endure our physical exhaustion. Who is there to pity us!</p>
<p>Because rice prices are high, most stores have switched to porridge for dinner, which is how bosses save money.</p>
<p>Recently, because the authorities issued a notice about saving electricity, we can rest after closing at 8 PM. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to rest until after 10 PM.</p>
<p>What are our sleeping quarters like? Most are lofts. A bed made up of three boards and a few boxes. Of course, there's no fresh air, sunlight never shines in, and hygiene is out of the question!</p>
<p>Let's talk about our income. Our monthly salary, monthly allowances, and rice subsidy combined range from seventy to one hundred and sixty yuan. What can that amount do? In the current environment of soaring prices, those who are married and have some family property can still manage, but those without family property have to find other ways. Now, our families are enduring hardship by selling rice and goods.</p>
<p>Stores have been making a lot of money in recent years, but most bosses are very stingy. The bonuses given to shop assistants are only 5%. What can shop assistants say about this! Anyone who dares to protest prepares to pack their bags.</p>
<p>We also have a hardship to bear, which is having to wear a damn long gown, socks, and shoes. We cannot be casually dressed while standing at the counter.</p>
<p>I remember someone invented a term called "hidden poverty." It really seems to describe our group.</p>

<h3>National Forum: Suggestions and Appeals Regarding Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— Ming Shi</p>
<p>I am newly arrived from North China, having personally experienced the suffering of disaster victims. I will say a few heartfelt words to contribute to the disaster relief authorities:</p>
<p>(1) Relief Funds and Relief Grain: The disaster in North China this time is not due to a lack of "funds," but rather a lack of "grain." Speaking of the grain shortage, it did not begin today. Originally, in years of good harvest, North China only produced enough food for 80% of its consumption. Later, North China, within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, strived to supply cotton, resulting in an increase in cotton fields and a corresponding daily decrease in the area of land producing grain.</p>
<p>Therefore, even without this major drought, the shortage of food for the people was already very evident. For example, the suburban residents of Beijing were already eating tree bark the year before last. However, the grain shortage in the city was not very apparent, because since the incident, the source of flour imported from Australia and the United States has been cut off. As a result, tree bark also opened for sale in the grain market of Beijing. Therefore, only by purchasing food outside of North China and transporting it into the disaster area can there be true relief.</p>
<p>(2) Selection and Purchase of Relief Grain: Currently, purchasing rice in the South and transporting it north for disaster relief seems to be the simplest and quickest method. However, rice is the staple food of the people in the South. If a large amount is transported north, it will inevitably not only create a rice shortage in Central China, but also increase rice prices and add to the suffering of the poor. Therefore, purchasing miscellaneous grains is better than purchasing flour, which is better than purchasing rice. In this way, on the one hand, the disaster victims in North China are relieved, and on the other hand, the livelihood of the people in Central China is not greatly affected, because most of the people in Central China do not eat miscellaneous grains.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also economic reasons for this, because miscellaneous grains are always cheaper than rice; with the same amount of money, buying miscellaneous grains will save more lives than buying rice.</p>
<p>There is also a very interesting point: At one time, the grain prices in Beijing were very chaotic. For example, flour was sold for three yuan per catty, and millet was the same price. As a result, the poor still rushed to buy millet. In fact, millet is coarse grain, and flour is a refined product. Usually, the price of flour is twice as high as that of millet. But why didn't the poor buy flour? Because they were not hoarding, but rather feeding themselves. Ordinary people can be full by eating half a catty of millet, but half a catty of flour is not enough. Therefore, to relieve the suffering, no matter from which aspect you consider it, miscellaneous grains are the most suitable relief grain.</p>
<p>(3) Location for Purchasing Relief Grain: According to the report on donations solicited by the newspaper, a total of more than 400,000 yuan has been received so far. If this amount is remitted to Kaifeng, Henan, it can only purchase 16,000 catties of millet, but in Jinan, 32,000 catties can be purchased, in Zhangjiakou, 80,000 catties can be purchased, and in Manchukuo, almost 160,000 catties can be purchased. Conversely, if grain is purchased and distributed locally in disaster areas such as Shangqiu outside of Kaifeng, it will probably not even be possible to buy 16,000 catties.</p>
<p>In a wartime controlled economy, distorted prices are unavoidable. In order to relieve the dying disaster victims, we should make the best efforts to obtain the greatest results, provided that we do not harm the overall policies of the various regions. I think that our efforts will certainly win the sympathetic consideration of the governments of friendly Japan, Manchuria, and Mengjiang.</p>
<p>(4) Appeal to the Central Government: From the above, it can be seen that the power of philanthropists is weak. We also know that the political power of a part of North China is not enough. After the panic of the people of North China not being able to buy food with money occurred last year, the ruling authorities in North China negotiated with all parties, but the severity of the situation has not diminished at all to this day. This is because, under wartime conditions, there are too many controlled institutions, so the smooth progress of matters is inevitably very difficult.</p>
<p>If the central government comes forward and contacts the central institutions of friendly Japan, Manchuria, and Mengjiang, all difficulties will be easily resolved. For example, in Mengjiang, the amount of food consumption is inversely proportional to that of North China, that is, the amount of consumption only accounts for 20% of the amount of production. According to the statement of the Mengjiang representative stationed in Beijing, Mengjiang hopes to exchange its food for manufactured products from North China, just as North China wants to exchange its manufactured products for food from Mengjiang.</p>
<p>When can this exchange be realized? Today, when friendly countries are changing their policies toward China, the efforts of the central government will be completely successful.</p>
<h3>"Grasping the Present" and "Caring About Politics"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yilian</p>
<p>Since the National Government joined the war, the friendly country Japan has automatically changed its policy toward China, and enlightened people are deeply grateful. This move is what we have long desired. Once it comes, it is a valuable and rare opportunity, and even more a turning point for the revival of China.</p>
<p>At this time, those in power are like "having all the strings in their hands," unlike before when they were hindered or lost sight of one thing while attending to another. Therefore, they can make progress at double speed, show their achievements, and win the hearts of the people at the best time of the year. Therefore, anyone who is still watching and staying at the current stage is already behind the times, and even more shameful if they neglect the opportunity and miss it. It is hoped that those in power will recognize this clearly and not make any mistakes.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the part of the people, how should we "tread on thin ice" to grasp this hard-won opportunity? We should know that working hard in our positions and catching up is not as good as others. As for the small number of stubborn elements, their consciousness is not clear and they still wrongly see the present as nothing more than a "transitional period," that politics has not yet become clear, so there is no need to be nervous, no need to grasp the present, and they can just hesitate. This kind of view is really wrong, and they should be quickly told the benefits and shown the new understanding.</p>
<p>The Chinese people are generally accustomed to neglecting the present and idealizing the future. We must know that without present efforts, a beautiful future will not fall from the sky.</p>
<p>In summary, the government has gradually shown that it is grasping the situation and making achievements, and the people should further strengthen their beliefs and be able to follow up and move forward.</p>
<p>The above is to promote the importance of "grasping the present," and the following is the reason for "caring about politics."</p>
<p>Most of the general public are bound by the rhetoric and ideology of the former Chongqing Communist era. After being suppressed for a long time, they have developed a habit of not caring about national affairs, so that the government is the government and the people are the people. The government's national policies and laws are ignored unless they are forcibly implemented. This has been the case in the past and is even more inappropriate at this time of self-extraction and self-rescue. Therefore, the people should urgently care about politics, in order to understand the government and integrate with the government in harmony, so that the effectiveness of doing things will be doubled, and the revival of a strong country depends on it. It can also eliminate the current bad phenomenon of the general public "living in groups all day long and not mentioning righteousness."</p>
<p>Therefore, "caring about politics" can promote the integration of politics and people on the active side, and enable people to better adapt to wartime life on the passive side. However, after the people care about politics, they may express their opinions, which requires those in power to have a tolerant and elegant attitude, not to criticize. Fortunately, our responsible leader Chairman Wang appreciates the opinions of the people, so now is a good time to "care about policies."</p>
<p>If these two slogans can be promoted to the public, it will surely be of great help to the revival of China and the construction of East Asia.</p>

<h3>Primitive Art of Living</h3>
<p>— Bao Ming</p>
<p>Before the term art of living was coined, people's artistic life already existed. After the new darling from the West was introduced, it made people feel that their ordinary life originally included noble art.</p>
<p>The simple and rigid life of the old farmers in the countryside, in the eyes of ordinary people, should be excluded from the scope of art. But don't underestimate them. When the year is good, after they finish their work during the day, the setting sun is sinking, and the crows are returning to their nests, they will have a moment of rest, holding a dry tobacco pipe, looking out at the boundless wilderness, puffing out smoke leisurely, and no one knows what they are thinking.</p>
<p>The earthy smell of the wilderness penetrates into every pore. They think of the distant horizon. This is their art of living. At this time, they are appreciating life, forgetting everything, relaxing their bodies and minds, and dissolving into the interest of understanding.</p>
<p>But when natural disasters and man-made misfortunes follow, and a painful and miserable fate forces them, they will also rise up to fight for liberation and survival. This can also be said to be their art of living.</p>
<p>This is art, noble art. The glory of mankind emanates from this simple idea, creating the glory of culture in their simple lives. This art of living is worthy of admiration and learning.</p>
<p>The art they express in life is not formal, not decorative, and even lacks the awareness of enjoying this noble art, like gentlemen sitting on sofas with tobacco pipes in their mouths, appreciating oil paintings or patterns, casually flipping through books, chanting, and silently thinking about women, banknotes, and seeking private gain, claiming to live an artistic life.</p>
<p>But if such a life is considered art, then I will never agree, precisely because I admire that simple, beautiful life that comes from the heart, starting from the noblest and deepest place of mankind. Although we see cleanliness, magnificence, and brilliance from the surface of gentlemen, we do not know that behind this cleanliness, brilliance, and magnificence lies evil, and the blood of cannibals. Their fake artistic life is disgusting and heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Why is that? This is because their methods are too vicious and dangerous, and their appearance is too kind. They want to relax their bodies and minds in the spare time of cannibalistic work, calling it "the art of living," in order to complete their sins. They think that every step and every move should have artistic expression, reading should have art, and talking to guests should also have artistic conditions. What is the use of these trivial pretenses? They want to cover up all sins, calling it nobility, so that true art will forever leave them.</p>
<h3>March of the Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>— Disaster Victim</p>
<p>Heaven is stingy with rain and dew,</p>
<p>Here is a wasteland of dryness, a chorus of cries!</p>
<p>We live through tonight, not knowing tomorrow.</p>
<p>The sun is burning overhead,</p>
<p>Hunger is tormenting our stomachs,</p>
<p>Heaven, we have dug up all the ferns,</p>
<p>Drained all the reeds;</p>
<p>Stripped all the tung trees, cut down all the banana trees,</p>
<p>We have eaten the mud under the ground,</p>
<p>Even the flesh of the dead has not been spared!</p>
<p>Let us flee elsewhere?</p>
<p>Those elsewhere are also fleeing to us.</p>
<p>Heaven, we hundreds of millions of innocent people,</p>
<p>'</p>
<p>Is there only a dead end!</p>
<p>Is there only a dead end!</p>
<p>Heaven, no, we do not beg Heaven,</p>
<p>We only beg our dear compatriots across the country,</p>
<p>When you eat, do not forget that we are eating mud,</p>
<p>When you drink tea, do not forget that we have to walk ten miles to fetch water,</p>
<p>One yuan can save our lives,</p>
<p>One tear can moisten our seedlings.</p>
<p>Our dear compatriots across the country, our dear compatriots across the country! (Moving to donate to the North China drought)</p>
<h3>Sincerity, Diligence, Endurance, and Hard Work</h3>
<p>— Jiang Guozhang</p>
<p>I remember that the motto of a certain large pharmaceutical factory in Shanghai is Sincerity, Diligence, Endurance, and Hard Work. These four words are most appropriate as a factory motto. However, it is also not impossible to use them as our motto.</p>
<p>Sincerity is honesty. Dishonesty is deception. People who like to deceive will never achieve great things. May I ask, who in the world has achieved great things through deception?</p>
<p>Diligence is thrift. Non-diligence is laziness. Old man Chongde said, "People are healthy if they are diligent, and families prosper if they are diligent." We want people to be healthy and families to prosper. Can we not be diligent and thrifty?</p>
<p>Endurance is patience. Non-endurance is impatience. As the saying goes, "Small impatience can ruin big plans." An ordinary person with a bad temper is prone to causing trouble, which is also due to impatience.</p>
<p>Hard work is labor. Non-hard work is ease. Often, children from poor families can achieve great things, while children from wealthy families tend to fall, which is also the result of hard work and ease. Which great person in the world did not struggle from hard work?</p>
<p>In short: These four words of Sincerity, Diligence, Endurance, and Hard Work are indispensable for people to conduct themselves in the world. I hope that we can all take them as our motto and do them at all times (Moving to help education).</p>
<h3>Records of the Japanese Navy (9)</h3>
<p>— Oshita Udaer</p>
<p>(12) Pioneer of the Sea Defense Fee Donation</p>
<p>Emperor Meiji was deeply concerned about sea defense. On February 10, 1893, he issued an imperial edict stating that for the next six years, 300,000 yen would be drawn from the imperial treasury and one-tenth of the salaries of general civil and military officials would be paid to build the warships Fuji, Hachijo, Akashi, and Miyako. (The Fuji warship is now a training ship for navigation schools. Last June, leaders of the Japanese student marine class underwent a five-day practical training on this ship.) Prior to this, on March 14, 1887, an imperial edict was issued to grant 300,000 yen for sea defense enhancement.</p>
<p>The year before 1887, the warship Mutsu, which was returning from France, went missing. After receiving the edict of March 14, senior officials gathered to discuss future policies. The sea defense issue was also discussed at the Rokumeikan on March 23. Early the next morning, a certain Kawasaki from Ibaraki Prefecture visited the governor of Ibaraki Prefecture, who was visiting Tokyo, at his residence and asked the governor:</p>
<p>"I heard that there was a meeting at the Rokumeikan yesterday to discuss His Majesty the Emperor's edict. I have always wanted to do something for the country to repay the national grace. What was discussed at the Rokumeikan?"</p>
<p>The governor told him the meaning of the Emperor's donation. Kawasaki immediately went to the next room, wrote a letter and presented it to the governor, expressing his willingness to donate 30,000 yen as a civilian of Ibaraki Prefecture for sea defense fees.</p>
<p>That application for donation became a pioneer, and the people who followed the donation reached more than 2 million yen.</p>
<p>This can be said to be the arrow of the warship donation movement. Another touching story is that during the Russo-Japanese War, a woman named Kamizaki Yukiko initiated a torpedo boat donation movement.</p>
<p>Kamizaki Yukiko's husband was a torpedo boat crew member who participated in the Weihaiwei night attack battle during the Sino-Japanese War. However, at that time, Petty Officer Kamizaki suffered a major failure. At that time, the enemy flagship Dingyuan was targeted, and it was intended to launch a torpedo, but the launch tube was sealed by ice. Enemy bullets flew like rain, so the torpedo could not be launched.</p>
<p>That night, three torpedoes did hit the Dingyuan. However, the next morning, the Dingyuan was still leisurely floating in the center of the port, and we thought that torpedoes had no effect on ironclad ships. Just as we were thinking this, the ship gradually sank, and it was completely submerged before dusk, and everyone felt relieved. However, Petty Officer Kamizaki, feeling responsible for the obstacles encountered in launching the torpedo, committed seppuku to martyr.</p>
<p>After that, the widow's heart harbored the idea of how to fulfill her husband's long-cherished wish. In May 1904, the Japanese Navy lost the warships Hatsuse and Yoshino due to accidents in dense fog. The Baltic Fleet was sailing to the Orient, and the Hitachi Maru and Sado Maru were dispatched. Then, it was heard that three enemy ships appeared near Tokyo Bay, and traces of warships were found off the coast of Izu Oshima, and the sound of cannons could be heard. At this time, the widow Kamizaki also started the torpedo boat donation movement.</p>
<p>Ms. Shimoda Utako was her supporter, and a play was held at the Honjo Kotobuki Theater to donate boats. As a result, the warship torpedo boat donation movement was finally completed. (Wing: Translated from the Seibu Asahi Shimbun) (End)</p>
<h3>Principles of Beauty</h3>
<p>— Jiang Feng</p>
<p>"Loving beauty is human nature" This sentence has almost become the facade of general modern ladies now!</p>
<p>I often see some young girls applying rouge, powder, drawing eyebrows, applying lipstick, painting nails, perming with cream, wearing high heels, wearing tight-fitting clothes with dazzling colors, and even applying rouge on their toes and wearing bracelets on their ankles... Dressing themselves up in a "foxy" manner. If someone asks them: "Why are you so beautiful?" The answer is: "Loving beauty is human nature, people are born to like beautiful things!"</p>
<p>In fact, they are just admiring vanity, and they don't understand the true meaning of beauty. There are two kinds of "inner beauty" and "outer beauty." What a person needs most is the former, such as a pure soul, a strong will, a perfect personality, noble morality, gentle character, and a fighting spirit...; not the latter.</p>
<p>Moreover, even "outer beauty" does not have a fixed standard. What A thinks is beautiful, B may not necessarily think is beautiful. In the eyes of some people, it is indeed colorful and gorgeous; but in the eyes of others, it may be considered grotesque and ugly. Don't you believe it? Here is a short poem as proof:</p>
<p>Cream smeared on fresh flowers,</p>
<p>It is neither beautiful nor elegant;</p>
<p>Natural beauty is obscured by it,</p>
<p>Independent personality is damaged by it;</p>
<p>It only attracts a group of gluttonous flies!</p>
<p>But I am very strange:</p>
<p>Why do some flowers prefer</p>
<p>To automatically apply cream?!</p>
<p>Prostitutes, dancers, and other women who are regarded as toys by men have to apply a thick layer of cream for the sake of bread. This is unavoidable in the ugly modern society. But some daughters of noble families and daughters of ordinary families have not been whipped by life, and for the sake of wrong "loving beauty" psychology, they actually learn from the examples of dancers and others, which makes people very puzzled!</p>
<h3>Absorption</h3>
<p>— Bai Liao</p>
<p>I remember that when my biology teacher talked about digestion, he specifically pointed out that the most important point for humans and all living things to maintain their lives with food is that after digestion, they can turn foreign bodies into their own bodies. At that time, this sentence had already attracted my attention, and now I deeply realize that this is the key to a person's success.</p>
<p>From the perspective of human growth, some people eat a lot of things and do not see them getting stronger, while some people do not eat much and their bodies are very strong. This is because the latter can "absorb."</p>
<p>From the perspective of reading, we can see that many people read many books and have a wealth of knowledge, but they cannot stand out. On the contrary, some people do not read many books, but they have achievements, abilities, successful careers, and realized ideals. What is the reason for this? Simply put, it is that one kind of person can read, and one kind of person cannot read. People who can read pay attention to "absorption." No matter what kind of book it is, as long as it is beneficial, they desperately absorb it, so that the things in the book become their own things, and then they truly progress; people who cannot read do not know how to "absorb," wasting energy, time, and money in vain, and there is no progress, which is so regrettable!</p>
<p>We can know that often the same thing happens, but everyone benefits differently, which all depends on the strength of each person's "absorption" ability. I dare say that the main reason for the success of great people is that they can "absorb" without wasting anything.</p>
<p>Do not let go of any small opportunity, and work hard to absorb!</p>
<p>This way you can find that there are places to train everywhere.</p>
<h3>Small Words on Duckweed (3)</h3>
<p>— Qian Fu</p>
<p>True knowledge does not lie in memorizing a lot of things in books, but in being able to obtain the true principles of things related to life. Therefore, when reading, there should be ample time for meditation and self-reflection, so that the essence of the book can be synthesized and the true principles of life can be understood.</p>
<p>There is "reason" only with "morality," and there is no "reason" without "morality," because "reason" is produced by "morality." Therefore, people who do not talk about "morality" will definitely not talk about "reason." Perhaps they will regard customs, habits, rules, and laws as "reason," but that is only "talking about what should be talked about" and "reasoning about what should be reasoned about." It is not the "true way" and "true principle" that are appropriate for the time, place, person, thing, situation, and environment. (Rather than paying)</p>
<h3>Golden Words of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Cai Chi Mo</p>
<p>Luxury is the guide to poverty, and poverty is the success of luxury.</p>
<p>Poverty can dissolve friendship, and wealth can attract friends.</p>
<p>A great man should automate all that he can outside of natural submission.</p>
<p>The more laborious life is, the more one can live; the happier the spirit is, the more one has spirit.</p>
<p>"Good fortune" does not refer to many children and grandchildren, or much wealth and power. It refers to being able to travel everywhere and increase knowledge, which is "good fortune."</p>
<p>The hardship of today is the joy of the future.</p>
<p>Using research efforts in the right direction becomes a career, and using research efforts in the wrong direction becomes a crime.</p>
<p>Doubt arises, and suspicion increases. Suspicion increases, and misunderstandings arise.</p>
<p>Good temper does not cost money, anger does not make money.</p>
<p>Treat yourself, when there is nothing wrong, seek fault; treat others, when there is fault, seek no fault.</p>
<p>The most suffering thing in the world is greed.</p>
<p>Always think in the direction of righteousness, integrity, and goodness, and the heart will naturally be bright.</p>
<p>Life cannot be separated from mutual assistance. Without mutual assistance, it is difficult to live.</p>
<p>Take away one point of luxury, and reduce one point of sin.</p>
<p>Things must be studied. Without research, they are always confused.</p>

<h3>Teachers and Students of Shanghai Jiang Primary School Respond to the Street Children Relief Movement</h3>
<p>All the faculty and staff and students of the private Shanghai Jiang Primary School sent a letter yesterday saying: "Children are the angels of the world and the masters of the future destiny of the country. At this time when life is under serious threat, these lively little masters are also suffering an unprecedented catastrophe, especially those orphans who have lost their parents. They are lonely, helpless, and homeless. Everyone knows that this group of lost lambs is in urgent need of our rescue and care. As the saying goes: "Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda." This is not an old saying. We extend ourselves to others and should relieve this group of orphans who are waiting to be fed, directly reducing the number of street orphans and indirectly accumulating a portion of vitality for the country. The principal, faculty, staff, and all children of our school are deeply aware of the urgent need to relieve orphans, so we are not ashamed of our meager efforts and respectfully donate 300 yuan and 3 jiao saved from candy expenses to your newspaper, requesting that you donate it to orphan education institutions. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is also a little bit of our responsibility." (The money has been received. Thank you. And we hope that all sectors will continue to contribute so that we can reach the target of 100,000 yuan.)</p>
<h3>Three Elementary School Students Sympathize with Su Yi of</h3>
<p>(Letter) Reading the newspaper, we learned that Mr. Su Yi of, of Pingliang Road Sacred Heart Primary School, died of resentment due to unreasonable parents. We felt very sorry and could not express it. Now, we are requesting Mr. Xu Zichang to forward the 220 yuan in candy expenses to Mr. Su's family, and we hope that all the children in the city will enthusiastically contribute, so that they can accumulate a little and do good deeds together. Respectfully, Xu Guizhen, Xu Jingeng, and Xu Guiping, students of Xinhuan Primary School (The little friends saved 220 yuan from pocket money to give to Mr. Su's family, and it is rare to respect the way of teachers.)</p>
<p>Another group of elementary school students wrote a letter: "Mr. Su Yi, of Sacred Heart Primary School, died of anger due to unreasonable insults from students' parents. We felt infinitely sad when we saw this news. Mr. Su was a good teacher who taught students. In order to hope that the students would improve and encourage the students to work hard, it was a very common thing to punish the students slightly. Now, unfortunately, he has died in vain. None of us students are not sad. We feel that Mr. Su's death, on the surface, was due to unreasonable parents. But after thinking carefully, the only executioner who killed Mr. Su was the naughty little friend named Liu, because if that little friend named Liu was a good student who could accept the teacher's teaching, then this unfortunate thing would never have happened. Therefore, we would like to inform all the elementary school students in the city that they must work hard to study well in the future, listen to the teacher's teaching, and make up their minds to be good students to commemorate Mr. Su Yi, who sacrificed himself for education."</p>
<h3>Conservancy Relocation</h3>

To concentrate manpower and intensify work, the office location will be moved to Room 304, Guolou Building, 97 Renji Road, inside the China International Famine Relief Commission, starting June 1. The telephone number is 15845. Hereafter, for any contact, please go directly to the Conservancy's new office.</p>
<p>Seeking Diseased Chickens The China Huinong Society, in view of the significant losses to farming families every spring due to chicken plague, making chicken farming a perilous path, is now dedicated to researching the origins of the plague and manufacturing medicines for prevention. We are now seeking live, plague-stricken chickens. Please send the chickens to Dr. Lan at 165 Great Western Road. We are willing to purchase them at market price. We would be even more grateful for those who voluntarily donate.</p>
