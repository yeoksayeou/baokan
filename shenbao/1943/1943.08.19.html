<h3 id="c1">重慶政權之命運 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>政治是複雜而微妙的，然而我們如果能夠以歷史家的眼光去作客觀的解剖，還是可以觀察到可能的趨勢的。我們記得，在大東亞戰爭爆發以前，重慶政權用以安慰人心的，彷彿說，只要一旦英美有了對日作戰的決心；「抗戰」形勢就會激變，「勝利」便可翹首以待了。實際上，企圖利用人心的麻醉，來繼續其拖戰政策而已。</p>
<p>然而，大東亞戰爭一年八個月來的官方補給的實，第一，日本已在短時期內，驅除了太平洋上的英美勢力，重慶政權所倚爲泰山的，竞如雲人一樣在烈日下消融無踪了。這是重慶在國際政策上最大的打擊。第二，在日本以一國之兵對付世界最大帝國主義聯合戰力之際，重慶政權不僅求能同時踐約「反攻」，相反的，東有浙贛路之慘敗，北有中條山之崩潰，特別是西南的生命綫——滇緬路，竟變為日軍進攻「抗戰」最後根據地的進兵路綫，日軍已衝破重慶西南最前綫雲南的防綫。第三，重慶對外的交通完全阻塞以後，內部經濟上的混亂與危岌也日趨嚴重，尤以物價及物咨問題，到了「治絲益棼」的地步，所謂「增加生產」，以及「改善民生」，也只是徒托空言。</p>
<p>重慶政權的危機既如此嚴重，因此，在他控制下的地區，又醞釀浙的事熊。首先，是人民普遍的對　重慶政權的懷疑與不滿，人民眼看一年八個月以來重慶政權所有理論與政策的無信用，無實力，而人民處境之痛苦，尙不知要忍受到何時。於是，我們聽到了湖南·甘肅·陜西等地不斷發生民　與暴動的消息，日前渝方甘肅民政廳長王漱芳，據傳亦已於混亂中被害。少數統治者及發「國難財」的窮奢極慾，與大多數公務員及生產者之貧困瀕死，這種矛盾，怎能不加深人民叛難的危機。</p>
<p>其次，是共產勢力因此坐大。所謂「陝廿寗邊區」，發令施政，誘脅民心，軍事·行政·經濟·文化·敎育·……完全自成體制，成為重慶政權的腹心大患。這是「拖戰政策」的惡果之一，重慶政權中人，也不能不自已承認與痛悔吧？</p>
<p>重慶政權所以遭遇這樣嚴重的危機，最主要的原因，就是由於對英美認識的錯誤，在事變以前不必說了，事變以後，原有許多事態，可以看到英美挑撥中日關係的罪行，和一切對華不利的陰謀，然而重慶政權寗可放棄許多可以挽救本身及中國命運的機會，如德大使陶德曼氏調停及後來近衛首相對華政策宣言等，竟仍一意孤行，甘心爲英美犧牲，作東亞叛逆。入阱愈深，擺脫愈難，被英美固拍手租快，而我人民則痛苦益深。重慶政權本身亦無法自拔於日趨嚴重的危機。共次，重慶方以參加反軸心國陣營爲得計，可是，試一覆按二次大戰爆發以來的事實，動慶所得英美之助爲多少？當德蘇戰機未發之時，蘇聯以世界革命及助長中國共產運動之動機，固曾作較多的援助，其數字數　於英美，然其結果對中國究竟是禍是　？執重慶份子　詢之，似亦無以自解！自從歐洲東綫戰起，蘇聯對渝之接濟斷電，英美之協　頗形喧囂，可是，初有滇緬路的封　，繼有對　內政與軍事的干涉，英美所謂「友誼」究爲　物？早　引起渝方輿論之　起指摘。但重慶政權並不介意，廿為英美之傀儡。至大東亞戰起，英美始擬進一步支　重慶使其牽制日本一部份軍力，但不旋踵而南洋失陷，緬甸淪亡，援渝路絕。英美本身也自太平　上狼狽遁　。執迷的重慶政權安得不受嚴重之打擊。此外，反軕心國英美蘇聯間，爾虞我詐，表面以彼此利用而合作，實際則彼此嫉惡而衝突，此在最近難斯　邱吉爾第六次會談中所表現者，已可洞燭其內幕。重慶廁身於美英蘇聯之間，事齊事秦，徬徨躊躇，福未必見而禍則必至，這是稍明事勢者所共知，但重慶政權則甘心自處於衝突之中，以國事委之於人，卒至　可自拔，今日對蘇聯固無友誼好感可見，二宋對美之活動又告失敗，今宋子文赴英活動，又以「不滿之永嘉一而結束了。</p>
<p>對外毫無辦法，自然只有對內打算盤了——於是對西北發展啦，對中共摩擦啦，這種消息便不斷的傳出來了！老實說，重慶之「安內」完全是最後的一種掙扎而已。如果因爲他標榜「反共一而加以過高的評價，顯然是一種錯誤。然而，專心安內的結果，對重慶政權，必然引起更大的內部的分裂與危機，近數年來，在重慶政區內，不滿於重慶政權一切內外政策及施政的呼聲，不僅　及於各黨各派，如「民主政團同盟」更不辭加以正面的打擊，而倡導改組渝府：即在一般靑年及無黨無派之羣衆中，也早因種種事實而激起各方的反感。重慶政權早已面臨離心運動的危機。今日加緊「安內」勢必促使此種危機的總爆發。重慶政權爲了對外無辦法無出路，而轉注全力於「安內」，在六年來高唱「抗戰」「民主」「容共一「聯蘇」口號之後，而有此斷然相反的暗示，不能不認係一大轉變。現在一面在政治上强調中央集權，以反對地方分裂割據，以一西北中央化」爲其中心；一方面在軍事上强調統一編制號令，强化軍事獨裁，而以準備剿共爲其中心口號。</p>
<p>我們就上面的分析，可以覜察重慶政權終於走上末落之途，諺云：「棋差一着滿盤楡」。在英美發動所謂「太平洋反攻」之日，重慶已無力搖其吶喊之旗，因而向以利用人心的「總反攻」之說，不攻自破。在此四面楚歌的情勢之下，於是重溫「安內」舊夢。另一方面，友邦日本現在太平洋上擊退英美之「反攻」，確保優勝地位；同時，爲貫澈解放柬亞民族與建設東亞新秩序之旨，促成緬甸實現獨立，協助菲律賓準備獨立，協力印度的獨立運動，尤其是對華新政策的逐步實踐，對於東亞民族尤其中國人民的心理上發生極大的轉變。在兩種不同的情勢比較之下，重慶政權統治地區的無黨無派及一般靑年羣衆，自然更得激起離心的反感，以至於危機的爆發，所以，南京國民政府能以强有力的事實因勢利導，那末，重慶統治區的大衆趨向合流，將爲必然趨勢，全面和平，也將從此促成。</p>

<p>全師撤至義大利本土準備繼續作有效抗戰</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電德元首大本營十七日下午一時、以特別戰報發表：軸心軍於十七日上午六時依照預定計劃·全軍秩序整然·自西西里島撤至義本土之加拉布利亞省。</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　據德國新聞社特派員訊：自西西里島整裝撤退之軸心强大軍隊·實爲撤離歐洲之突出點而已，因敵人在海陸空三面均佔優勢·故此次撤退與英國在鄧扣克之役相較，實覺光榮。英異之德義軍隊現已抵達義國大　·除携囘受傷之同志及俘獲之敵軍外·其他武器如坦克車大砲數千　之運　車等均同時帶囘·即可重行參加作戰·且其他軍需及裝備亦獲完全撤退·此可爲有組織行動之表現。</p>
<p>德軍光榮戰史一頁</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電據海通社軍事特派員訊：西西里島之撤退現已完成，此乃依照德軍指揮部之預定計劃。於事實上言之，即自反軸心軍登陸之數日後，軸心軍未能將之擊退，則軸心軍之撤退，即已趨於明顯。在七月十六日，英美軍隊在西西里內地獲得相當之進展，此使其後至之軍隊在繼　夕戰鬥中獲得展開之機會，故反軸心軍將再不能被　東西島之外，因其控制海面，則其增援部隊及供應之可能性，自較軸心軍爲大也，即使德軍自義國大陸儘量增援·亦不能抵消軸心軍自始之不利也。依照此種局勢，德軍指揮部早已決定盡可能之範圍內，更以抵抗及予敵軍以最大之損失，而羈留敵軍於數星期之久，德軍對擠此項工作，以其執行之良好，於戰爭史上　無先例。以兩師團之德軍傷害十五師之反軸心部隊，德軍之增援最多不過半師團而已，而竟能拖延至六星期之久，於加拿人第一師之受損百份之七十觀之，可知德軍作戰之勇猛，故雖犧牲二個半師團之德軍亦竟值得。但德軍現已全師而退矣，此其成功猶足多者。</p>

<p>英美蘇問之微妙的關係，成爲最近即將舉行的英美會談之背景，十一日夜　朝日新聞社用國際電話向柏林守山特派員探詢雜國方面對此作何觀測。</p>
<p>本社</p>
<p>英美雖然希望蘇聯派遣代表出席三國會議，但蘚聯仍未有代表前往。在戰局嚴重的時候，反軸心方面仍祗有羅邱二人商談，英美蘇三國之間·似乎還沒有互相妥協諒解。</p>
<p>守山</p>
<p>最近英美與蘇聯的關係，並不十分圓滿有許多材料足資證明，其中成爲問題的事件，可列舉之如次：</p>
<p>八月十日，亡命倫教的南斯拉夫國政府改組，前駐法公使普然區就任總理兼外交部長，蘇聯所嫌壓的南國游擊戰隊長密哈葉洛維區將軍依然留任陸軍部長。新內閣是南國畢達國王所領導的國粹的政府，這自然違反丁蘇聯本身改造南國政府的希望二這一次沒有考慮到蘇聯的意見，因而蘇聯不表好感。</p>
<p>蘇聯境內的波蘭軍隊，向來與英方的波蘭亡命政府不合。蘇聯境內波蘭師團司令官海林格上校·於十日由史太林命令昇任爲少將。此與在英國的波關亡命政府全然不同，乃係仰蘇聯鼻息的軍隊。這是因爲將來處理波蘭時，可以加强蘇聯發言權的綠故。</p>
<p>德國最近發表史太林的秘密命令書。這是在斯達林格勒之戰後的二月十八日史太林給　蘇聯前綫司令官的秘密命令書。其內容爲。史太林把這次的戰爭分爲三個階段。第一階段是防遏德軍向蘇聯進攻，第二階段是從蘇聯領土內馳逐這外敵。第三階段是無產階級獨裁，世界共產革命。那密令上說：「我們現在是第二階段的時候，這次驅逐成功之日，則立即進入第三階段，實現共產黨的目標。」自經德國發表之後，對歐洲諸國有極大的彩響，第三國際解散之後·英美振振有詞地說現在的共產主　不是昔日的共產主義，但深刻的動搖典不安，則是無　掩　的。</p>
<p>蘇聯與英美間的　種傾軋日趨深刻的事件，層出不窮。而微妙的義大利問題，乘時以起</p>
<p>本社</p>
<p>據說義大利問題英美蘇之間亦不一致·今後如其英美方而竟然在巴爾幹作戰，然因蘇聯在巴爾幹的勢力　大，是以英美蘇問的步調·將更形錯亂罷！此次的英美會談·即在討論將來戰局的對策·關於巴爾幹問題·想妥協反軸心方而的意見。</p>
<p>守山</p>
<p>是的。然而蘇聯方面强硬主張，與其商討義大利作戰，巴爾幹作戰等問題，如其不先在法國開闢第二戰綫，終感不快。</p>
<p>本社</p>
<p>關於英美蘇意。不一致的將來，作何看法？</p>
<p>守山</p>

<p>— 學子</p>
<p>喜雨聲中</p>
<p>久旱後的甘霖，一連下了好幾天：不　是宇宙的　埃一洗而　，就是每個市民的　心也略爲　淸一番。雖然這姍姍來遲的雨水對於秋收是否有極大的影響，尚不可知，但希望的細芽總因此而種在每個A的心中。再加以时逢佳節，七巧立秋相繼而來。於是「加倍思親」的，想　久別的·　雨的，乘涼的，討論　積計劃的，實行官塲交際的，傷時的，憂世的，採訪新開的，欣賞藝術的，尋花問柳的，追求愛情的，糊裏糊塗的，莫明其妙的，帶有各種情緒的人們就被這夏末秋初的晚風吹到娛樂塲中消遣這漫漫的長夜。結果是連日西長安街的長安大戲院「上座情況，皆突破已往記錄，」（八月八日「晨報」語）·而新新大戲院也就「未到八時，……早已高懸客滿牌矣。」（八月九日晨報語）了。</p>
<p>到底這兩個戲院的是什麽把戲能夠如此轟動故都面有榮色的市民呢？</p>
<p>兩個劇團</p>
<p>說起來應當感謝海上的藝術圈。長安和新新的『盛况空前」正是海上送來的兩個話劇團所做出的空氣。去年中旅創辦人唐槐秋氏就帶着他的一批人到故都來獻技。那時　就在長安戲院演過幾天熱鬧戲。不幸去年冬天正在演『綠窗紅淚」的時候，却突然因「故」停演·而唐氏父女及導演陳綿博士也就貫現共「緣窗紅淚」的生涯了。這「故」畢竟是過去了。於是唐訓團的名聲又給市民一個更深切的印象。中旅是解散了。新中國劇團　繼之而生，其　還是以唐氏父女爲中心的話劇團。唐氏父女脫「故」後曾於中央公園音樂堂演過一次「合作劇」，大受歡迎。最近因爲長安戲院彩頭戲的糾紛，「天上斗牛宮」算是搬到天上去了。　新中　劇團也就乘機佔　了長安</p>
<p>新中國劇團　長安一共演過三齣戲。第一個「茶花女」就已「成績甚侍」，第二齣，新劇「金絲雀」更爲動人，晨報記老甚至於在「辛酸的「金絲雀」觀後題目下，特別寫過一篇批評。第三齣就是「梅維香」。此劇本是唐氏的拿手戲無怪乎「成緒空前」（八月八日晨報語）。　說繼「梅羅香」之　就要出演，去冬因故停　的「緣窗紅淚」、而進畢就要到津門去一走。</p>
<p>新新本來就常出演話據。四一劇社的「北京人」和「財狂」就是在新新出演的。然而這一次「連　滿堂」的却是海上影人嚴重所帶領的華藝劇團的「秋海棠」。這位中旅　將自從加入電影界後。　算是成功了一個小小的明星‘據說「因爲電影會　沒了他的夭才的」，所以他「又跳出銀幕，而重返到話劇團裏來了。「（語見八月七日晨報「介紹華藝劇團」一文）他這次的確是以「鄭重」的熊度來故都獻技的。未到之　，先來一個宣傳。既到之後、就到晨報社去拜訪，而八月七日的農　也就出丁一期「上海華藝劇團公演特刊。」第一次公演的日期遲的正是七巧夜。於是「未到八時·新新門首，早已·　　「客滿」矣，不但是七巧夜一次「客滿」·而且是「連售滿堂」的。「秋海棠」還在演、演　　說就要開演「三千金」。</p>
<p>舊劇式徵</p>
<p>近來話劇在北京確是走了紅運。所以晨報　宮　的「每日一事」就說：「　京與上淸觀衆的眼光，頭然已經有互相調換的現象。上海方面歡迎售劇，而北京的話劇彩面戲確相當活躍」·（八月八日）不過這「相當活躍」是不是「眼光調換」的結果　有討論的餘地。北京人一向是古典派的，一向是喜歡舊劇的。像楊小樓那樣的「絕技」恐怕也只有北京人博得歡迎。然而現在話劇却如是活躍。這是不是證明北京人的眼光已經調換了呢？只要觀察一下近來戲劇界的演變，我們就知道話劇的活躍正足以證明北京人之歡迎舊劇。這幾年來總　是舊劇的厄運哪。繼楊小樓·王又宸之後的·去年死了高慶奎·程繼先·言菊朋，今年又死了余叔岩。其他次要的角色還不算在內·死去的算是死去了，然而活着的却不獻技。梅蘭芳早已和故都人士作別了：程艷秋又因爲受了「某種刺激」而解散秋文社，荀　生總算是相當努力，然而「病倒上海灘」之後，就連「　　婦」的勇氣也沒有了，四人名旦剩下的只有尙小　。然而尙小雲畢竟是太老了。其他比較有名的鬚生，如馬連良，譚當英等。且不說其「勉充其數」，就算他是名角，然而也多半被人體聘而走江湖了。只有孟小冬不出京門，可是她是連開門也不常出的；一年遠上不了兩次裏。在這種情形之下，到處都是新派的人物，儘管報紙上如何宣傳其爲名旦或名聚生，但在一般北京人眼光裏確是「瞧不上」的。北京人不是不歡迎舊戲，乃是不歡迎「不夠味」的舊戲。因此統得另找　樂的出路。第一個應運而生的就是所謂「彩頭戲」。這彩頭戲也曾轟動過一時，然而不久長安的「天上斗牛宮」就搬到天上去，而東安市塲內吉祥戲院的「開闢天地」也就到地下去開關了。彩頭戲倒運之後，取而代之者就是話劇。目前北京的話劇確是很活躍，活　到連程艷秋老板都有點不服氣。聽說有一次唐槐秋請客，席間大加批評舊戲；彼時程老板正在坐，聽到這些批評，退席後，就發牢騷說：「一個唐　秋可眞可以啊！你幹擬的話劇，爲什麼褒眨我們舊劇呢！」（八月三日晨報藝宮欄）</p>
<p>話劇前途</p>
<p>可是北京人壓根兒是喜歡夠味的舊戲的。所以就在話劇盛況空前的時候，晨報的記老就幫着　艷秋說了一句話：「話劇界，舊劇界同致力於藝爾者，雖立塲不同，而目的確一，以立塲不同而貶薄他人，於理所不取也！」（八月四日晨報藝宮　「每日一事」）就是前些日子，實報誤戰梅蘭芳囘返故都的消息，也曾激動了北京人士莫大的感情。這些都足以證明北京人是如何的思念舊戲的「味」至於這種眼光是否錯　，則是另外的問　了。我們可以預言：在不久的將來，話劇又將在北京消沉下去。至於再後是否　　舊戲人才的缺乏而不得不走上接受話劇的路，則不是我們所得而知的了，（八月十日）</p>

<p>治標方法就斷然是實打嚴制收買囤積最大之物資，使囤積的對象消減，然後始能誘　游資納入正軌，則治本增加生產方法，才能實現。</p>

<p>對受訓學員致訓詞</p>

<h3 id="c38">如何保證資本安全？ <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>日昨大陸新報於其所說「生產活動强化的前提」中，認爲促進生產活動，其最重要者爲對資本安全之保證，同時必須根除心理不安之狀態。無疑地，心理不安之狀態，亦即源於資水之不能獲得安全保證。</p>
<p>鑒於最近中央儲備銀行曁銀行聯合準備會錢業聯合準備庫調劑同樂資金之舉，尤其中央儲備銀行供給各行莊因扶助正當生產事業所需要之資金，深覺財政當局以及金融界領袖能夠把握人民的心理，以强化生產活動，爲保證資本安全的條件。</p>
<p>以囤積日常用品爲資本安全之保證、那是不啻飲酖止渴，其結果必等於自殺；以强化生產活動爲資本安全之保證，共保證的力量方爲澈底的，方爲無窮盡的，所以，囤積紗布不是恃，囤積一切日常用品亦不足待、所可恃者、投資於正當生產事業，「取之不盡，用之不竭，」那欃是保證資本安全的正路。</p>
<h3 id="c39">中儲銀行辦理　各業生產貸款 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行爲調　各業資金安定市面起見，允供給各行莊頭寸·充辦理各業貸款之用，其利率特別低落，規定凡各行莊得向中儲申請供給資金，將是項資金轉貸給各業，惟借款人應以本業確有正當需要者爲限、視各工廠生產狀况酌定借款協助數額，但欲請貸款之工廠公司行號，必須各該業同業公會會員，及領有主管官署所發執照者，至於質押物之運揮，以不　反現行法令，不致助長囤積投機者爲限。凡棉紗布　以及日用必需之品，一概不得承受抵押，關於實物之折扣，　受統制有限　之貨物，不得高於限有十分之六，　不動產不得高於估價十分之五，　股票不得高於市價三折，　無限信之貨物不得高於市價三折，時期最長不得找過三個月，所以若干工廠公司行號，因收買原料增加生產，垮已獲得各行莊之貨款協助助。</p>
<h3 id="c40">原料統一收配　各工廠開工 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>水市各工廠，今春因原料缺乏，一部分不得已停工，或減少生產。自二十二同業聯合會及四專業委員會全部成立後，各工廠所需原料，已由各該業聯合會及專業委員會員負重統一收買及配給，故原責缺乏之恐慌，業已解除料目下本市大小工廠，均。全部開工，茲據調查各已要商品工廠之近況如此</p>

<p>目前開工者有五六家，油棉專業委員會正　華北方面大量收買大豆芝蔴菜籽花生等原料，一部分已經抵滬。</p>
<p>紡織廠</p>
<p>已大抵開工，一俟新花登塲，即將加緊生產，棉業奪委會正按照擬就之統一教　方案，在各地產區積　收花。</p>
<p>麵粉廠</p>
<p>今春小麥豐收，粉麥專委會已將小麥八百萬包配給各廠，現各廠正日夜加緊出粉中。</p>
<p>絲廠</p>
<p>春蘭收買已告竣事，中國絲業公　已收得春繭一萬担，現今開工　絲者共有三廠，每日出絲四担左右。至於本市各小型工廠，關係當局爲欲節省生產費起見，擬加以調整，詳細辦法，現正　密考慮中。</p>

<p>關係當局爲鼓勵農人繪加棉花生產，並儘量將　物出　起見。對於棉花之價格·將予以調整，如是收花工作，庶能便利進行。當局並擬協助棉花商人，在收買過程中·如遇資金不足，得向銀行辦理貸款·其乎　與小麥貸款相同，卽由商人出一票據求中交等銀行貼現，銀行將此票解往中央儲備銀行，淸求重貼現。</p>

<p>— 蔣同</p>
<p>處此百物　　之際，敎　　負敎育靑年之重任，度異常淸苦之生活，廣爲社會所景　與同情。蔣君壽同　議設立敎職員消費合作社，本報前曾提供意見，頃蔣君復爲交中論，然　殘佩，本　業爲發表於此，並盼敎育界曁社會熱心人士對於此項建議發抓切實意見，本報當葉集發表，共同研討，以期早觀厥成俾從連减輕敎職員之生活負擔也，—塲者附識</p>
<p>我最近曾發表一爲「創設上　市敎職員消費合作計芻議」的文章，引起各方面的討論，中報的「短評」也曾作有力的表示，提供很好的意見。現在，想再就合作社水身作進一步的闡述和探討。</p>
<p>爲了維繫民族的文化生命，要使文化的生命繼續成長和發展，首先便得顧到培養交化的教育事柴。上海一隅，戰後的敎育事業已遠非戰前的敎育事業所可比擬，敎育的設備固不必說，敎師的待遇更是慘不忍聞。時至今日一個，大學教授的收入已不及一個黃包車夫，一個小學敎員的月薪己在娘姨阿媽之下。敎師的生活既不安定，試問還有什麼健全的心情去從事神聖的教育事業呢？爲了幫助解決教職員們的生沾問題，减經教職員的生活魚扣，實有組織本市敎職員消費合作社的必要。</p>
<p>消費合作社的組織其目的是在避免商人的剝削，而將自己的必需品，自動　向生產者直接大損聯入，獲得廉價的機會。現在上海市的敎職員消費合作社，性質和目的也是如此·這是一個自動的爲解決切　生活問題的組織，其內容大抵是這樣—</p>
<p>宗旨：純粹爲敎職佩的生計問題着想，用敎戰員自身的集　力最來　貿廉價物，如內地的農業土產品，及當局的物資配給，由合作社公平分配於合作社員。</p>
<p>立塲：完全是敎職員自動的組織，經濟獨立，與政治絕無關聯。</p>
<p>組織：照選敎台界有名望的公正人十主持社務。凡現任本市服務半年以上之大巾小學校中國籍敎職員，都可入社。</p>
<p>範圍：包括敎職員本身及其家屬。</p>
<p>資　：（甲）每一社員（即敎職員）須自認一股·計二白元，內一百元可向各該學校移借。（乙）學生家長須墊　，暫定大學生每人一百元，中學生七十元，小學生三十　，無力負担者可向校方中請免繳。（丙）公開接受工商界人士的自動捐款　借款，（丁）得求名敎授著作及書畫等義實。</p>
<p>配給及購買：由該社向當局申請准予配給。包括日常生活的一切必需品，如米，汕，糖，布之類。並由該社派員直接向各物產地區大批購貿後分發。</p>
<p>分配：分配業象爲每一社員及其父母妻並子女，每一社員之分配份長並限制，但非直接家屬（即非父母妻及子女）者不得享受此項利益。</p>
<p>收款及分發：款項由各學校代收後送存指定銀行，公開之捐助或義　所得，則由該社魚責保管，賬目絕對公開，每月中會計師審核報告。</p>
<p>調查：凡社員及其家屬人數，由各該學校據實　吿，經該社確買調查後承認之。</p>
<p>轉限：合作社的建立爲永久性，惟魚責人員每年改遷一次。（學生家長之墊款及借款每年結算一次）。</p>
<p>以上的組識大綱，是我和幾位教育界同事屢次討論以後的結果，希望社曾的熱心人士以及敎育界同仁各本良心上的需要，多多發表意見，來共同促進這一有意義組織的實現。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Fate of the Chongqing Regime <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Politics is complex and delicate. However, if we can dissect it objectively from a historian's perspective, we can still observe potential trends. We remember that before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing regime used to comfort people by saying that as soon as Britain and the United States were determined to fight Japan, the "War of Resistance" situation would drastically change, and "victory" could be expected soon. In reality, it was merely an attempt to numb people's minds to continue its policy of protracted war.</p>
<p>However, in the past year and eight months since the Greater East Asia War, firstly, Japan has eliminated British and American forces in the Pacific in a short period. What the Chongqing regime relied on as its mainstay has vanished like clouds in the blazing sun. This is the biggest blow to Chongqing in terms of international policy. Secondly, while Japan is using the strength of one country to fight against the combined forces of the world's largest imperialists, the Chongqing regime not only failed to fulfill its promise of a simultaneous "counter-offensive," but instead suffered disastrous defeats in the east on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line and the collapse of the Zhongtiao Mountains in the north. In particular, the lifeline of the southwest, the Yunnan-Burma Road, has become the route for the Japanese army to advance on the last base of the "War of Resistance." The Japanese army has broken through the defense line of Yunnan, the southwestern frontier of Chongqing. Thirdly, after Chongqing's external transportation was completely blocked, the internal economic chaos and precariousness became increasingly serious, especially the problems of prices and supplies, which reached the point of "making things more confusing than they already are." The so-called "increase in production" and "improvement of people's livelihood" are merely empty words.</p>
<p>Since the crisis of the Chongqing regime is so serious, it has brewed signs of unrest in the areas under its control. First of all, there is widespread suspicion and dissatisfaction among the people towards the Chongqing regime. People see that all the theories and policies of the Chongqing regime have been untrustworthy and powerless in the past year and eight months, and they do not know how long they will have to endure their suffering. As a result, we have heard news of continuous civil unrest and riots in Hunan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and other places. It is said that Wang Shufang, the Gansu Civil Affairs Director of the Chongqing side, has also been killed in the chaos. The extravagance and extreme desire of a small number of rulers and those who make "national crisis fortunes," and the poverty and near-death conditions of the majority of civil servants and producers—how can this contradiction not deepen the crisis of popular rebellion?</p>
<p>Secondly, the communist forces have therefore become stronger. The so-called "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region" issues orders and implements policies, and uses enticement and coercion to win over people's hearts. Its military, administration, economy, culture, education,... are completely self-contained, becoming a major hidden danger for the Chongqing regime. This is one of the evil consequences of the "protracted war policy." People in the Chongqing regime cannot but admit and regret it themselves, right?</p>
<p>The most important reason why the Chongqing regime has encountered such a serious crisis is due to its misjudgment of Britain and the United States. Not to mention before the incident, after the incident, many situations have shown the crimes of Britain and the United States in provoking Sino-Japanese relations and all kinds of conspiracies that are detrimental to China. However, the Chongqing regime would rather give up many opportunities that could save itself and China's destiny, such as the mediation of German Ambassador Trautmann and the later declaration of Prime Minister Konoe's policy towards China, and stubbornly insisted on sacrificing itself for Britain and the United States, acting as a traitor to East Asia. The deeper it goes into the trap, the harder it is to get out. Britain and the United States clap their hands and applaud, while our people suffer more and more. The Chongqing regime itself cannot extricate itself from the increasingly serious crisis. Secondly, Chongqing considers it a good idea to join the Allied camp. However, if we review the facts since the outbreak of World War II, how much assistance has Chongqing received from Britain and the United States? When the German-Soviet war had not yet broken out, the Soviet Union, motivated by world revolution and promoting the Chinese communist movement, did provide more assistance, and its numbers exceeded those of Britain and the United States. But what was the result for China, good or bad? If you ask the Chongqing people, they seem to have no way to explain it themselves! Since the start of the war on the Eastern Front in Europe, the Soviet Union has cut off its aid to Chongqing, and the cooperation of Britain and the United States has been quite noisy. However, first there was the closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road, followed by interference in internal affairs and military affairs. What is the so-called "friendship" of Britain and the United States? It has long aroused criticism from Chongqing's public opinion. But the Chongqing regime does not care, and acts as a puppet of Britain and the United States. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, Britain and the United States initially planned to further support Chongqing to contain part of Japan's military strength, but soon after, Southeast Asia fell and Burma was lost, and the road to aid Chongqing was cut off. Britain and the United States themselves also fled from the Pacific in a panic. How could the deluded Chongqing regime not suffer a serious blow? In addition, among the Allies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, there is mutual deception and exploitation on the surface, but in reality, there is mutual jealousy and conflict. This can be seen from the recent sixth meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill. Chongqing is caught between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, serving both Qi and Qin, hesitating and wavering. Fortune may not be seen, but misfortune will certainly come. This is well known to those who are slightly aware of the situation. However, the Chongqing regime is willing to put itself in a state of conflict, entrusting national affairs to others, and eventually cannot extricate itself. Today, there is no friendship or goodwill towards the Soviet Union, and the two Song's activities in the United States have failed again. Now Soong Tzu-wen's activities in Britain have ended with "dissatisfaction."</p>
<p>Without any external solutions, it is natural to only plan internally—so there are messages constantly coming out about developing the Northwest and friction with the CCP! To be honest, Chongqing's "internal pacification" is entirely a last-ditch struggle. It would be a mistake to give it too high an evaluation simply because it trumpets "anti-communism." However, focusing on internal pacification will inevitably cause greater internal division and crisis for the Chongqing regime. In recent years, within the Chongqing-controlled areas, dissatisfaction with the Chongqing regime's internal and external policies and administration has not only extended to various parties and factions, such as the "Democratic League," which has not hesitated to launch frontal attacks and advocate the reorganization of the Chongqing government. Even among the general youth and non-partisan masses, various facts have long aroused resentment from all sides. The Chongqing regime has long faced a crisis of centrifugal movement. Today, stepping up "internal pacification" will inevitably lead to a total outbreak of this crisis. The Chongqing regime, having no external solutions or way out, is shifting its full attention to "internal pacification." After singing the slogans of "War of Resistance," "Democracy," "Tolerance of Communism," and "Alliance with the Soviet Union" for six years, this sudden and opposite implication cannot but be considered a major change. Now, on the one hand, it politically emphasizes centralism to oppose local division and secession, taking "centralization of the Northwest" as its center; on the other hand, it militarily emphasizes unified organization and command, strengthens military dictatorship, and takes preparing to suppress the communists as its central slogan.</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, we can see that the Chongqing regime is finally on the path to decline. As the saying goes, "One wrong move loses the whole game." On the day the United States and Britain launched their so-called "Pacific counter-offensive," Chongqing was unable to wave its flag of support, and thus its "general counter-offensive" theory, which used to exploit people's minds, collapsed on its own. In this situation of being besieged on all sides, it is reviving the old dream of "internal pacification." On the other hand, our friendly nation Japan is now repelling the British and American "counter-offensive" in the Pacific, ensuring its superior position. At the same time, in order to implement the purpose of liberating the East Asian nations and building a new order in East Asia, it is promoting the independence of Burma, assisting the Philippines in preparing for independence, and cooperating with the Indian independence movement. In particular, the gradual implementation of the new policy towards China has had a great psychological impact on the East Asian nations, especially the Chinese people. Comparing the two different situations, the non-partisan and general youth masses in the Chongqing regime's controlled areas will naturally be more aroused to a centrifugal resentment, leading to the outbreak of a crisis. Therefore, if the Nanjing National Government can take advantage of the situation with strong and forceful facts, then the trend of the masses in the Chongqing-controlled areas toward convergence will be an inevitable trend, and overall peace will be promoted from this.</p>

Furthermore, from late that day until dawn on the 16th, they bombed the vicinity of the American troop landing site on the island five times. Because it was not yet dawn and visibility was poor, the results of the battle could not be accurately determined, but it is known that there must have been considerable gains, and the advancing enemy troops have been suppressed from the air.</p>
<p>Tokyo, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - The Japanese naval air fleet, working closely together with the land operations on New Georgia Island, repeatedly bombed the enemy positions that were on their way, from the night of the 15th to the dawn of the 16th, inflicting considerable damage.</p>

<p>Entire Army Withdraws to Mainland Italy to Prepare to Continue Effective Resistance</p>
<p>Berlin, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - The German Supreme Headquarters issued a special battle report at 1:00 PM on the 17th: According to the planned schedule, the Axis forces completely and orderly withdrew from Sicily to the Calabria province of mainland Italy at 6:00 AM on the 17th.</p>
<p>Berlin, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - According to reports from a German News Agency correspondent: The powerful Axis army that has withdrawn in good order from Sicily is actually withdrawing from a salient point in Europe. Because the enemy has an advantage in all three areas of sea, land, and air, this withdrawal is more glorious compared to the British evacuation at Dunkirk. The German and Italian troops have now arrived in mainland Italy. In addition to bringing back wounded comrades and captured enemy troops, other weapons such as thousands of tanks and artillery pieces and transport vehicles have also been brought back at the same time and can be used in combat again. Moreover, other military supplies and equipment have also been completely withdrawn. This can be seen as a demonstration of organized action.</p>
<p>A Page in the Glorious History of the German Army</p>
<p>Berlin, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - According to reports from a Havas military correspondent: The withdrawal from Sicily has now been completed, in accordance with the pre-arranged plan of the German command. In fact, from several days after the Allied forces landed, if the Axis forces were unable to repel them, then the withdrawal of the Axis forces would have become obvious. On July 16, the British and American forces made considerable progress in the Sicilian interior, which gave the subsequent troops the opportunity to deploy in subsequent battles. Therefore, the Allied forces will no longer be able to cut off the east and west of the island, because they control the sea, so their possibility of reinforcements and supplies is greater than that of the Axis forces. Even if the German army sent as many reinforcements as possible from mainland Italy, it could not offset the Axis forces' initial disadvantage. According to this situation, the German command had already decided to resist as much as possible and inflict the maximum losses on the enemy, and hold the enemy for several weeks. The German army's execution of this task was so good that it was unprecedented in military history. Two German divisions damaged fifteen Allied divisions. The German reinforcements were at most half a division, yet they were able to delay for as long as six weeks. Considering the 70% damage suffered by the Canadian First Division, it can be seen that the German army fought bravely. Therefore, even the sacrifice of two and a half German divisions was worthwhile. But the German army has now retreated completely, which is a success in itself.</p>

<p>Lisbon, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - According to a dispatch from La Faleta: The Allied headquarters announced on the night of the 17th that American troops entered Messina on the morning of the 17th, and the battle of Sicily has now ended.

<p>Rome's Non-militarized Zone Not Recognized by Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Rome, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - Italian Prime Minister Marshal Badoglio convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the night of the 16th.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - According to an Associated Press dispatch from Quebec: The Roosevelt-Churchill talks were originally intended to review the response to the declaration of "Rome as a non-militarized city," but it is reported that the military leaders of Britain and the United States reached a consensus before the talks, that the Badoglio government must surrender unconditionally before the declaration can be recognized.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Appear to be Discordant, and Their Attitudes Towards the Current War Are Not Consistent <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The subtle relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has become the background for the upcoming Anglo-American talks. On the night of the 11th, the Asahi Shimbun used an international telephone to inquire with its Berlin correspondent, Moriyama, about the views of the various countries on this matter.</p>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun</p>
<p>Although Britain and the United States hope that the Soviet Union will send a representative to the tripartite meeting, the Soviet Union has not yet sent a representative. At a time when the war situation is serious, only Roosevelt and Churchill are still discussing matters, and it seems that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have not yet reached a compromise and understanding with each other.</p>
<p>Moriyama</p>
<p>Recently, the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has not been very satisfactory. There are many materials to prove this. Among the problematic events, the following can be listed:</p>
<p>On August 10, the exiled Yugoslav government in London was reorganized. The former ambassador to France, Purić, took office as prime minister and foreign minister. General Mihailović, the leader of the Yugoslav guerrillas, who was disliked by the Soviet Union, remained as the army minister. The new cabinet is a nationalist government led by King Peter II of Yugoslavia. This naturally violates the Soviet Union's own desire to transform the Yugoslav government. This time, the Soviet Union's opinion was not considered, so the Soviet Union did not express its approval.</p>
<p>The Polish troops in the Soviet Union have always been at odds with the British-backed Polish government-in-exile. Colonel Berling, the commander of the Polish division in the Soviet Union, was promoted to major general on the 10th by order of Stalin. This is completely different from the Polish government-in-exile in Britain, and is a military force that relies on the Soviet Union. This is because it can strengthen the Soviet Union's voice when dealing with Poland in the future.</p>
<p>Germany recently published Stalin's secret order. This is a secret order from Stalin to the Soviet front-line commanders on February 18, after the Battle of Stalingrad. The content is as follows: Stalin divided this war into three stages. The first stage is to prevent the German army from attacking the Soviet Union. The second stage is to drive out the foreign enemies from within Soviet territory. The third stage is proletarian dictatorship and world communist revolution. The secret order said: "We are now in the second stage. The day we succeed in driving out the enemy, we will immediately enter the third stage and realize the goals of the Communist Party." Since being published by Germany, it has had a great impact on European countries. After the dissolution of the Third International, Britain and the United States eloquently stated that the current communism is not the communism of the past, but the profound tremors and unease are undeniable.</p>
<p>Events in which the friction between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States is becoming increasingly severe are emerging one after another. And the delicate Italian issue arose at this time.</p>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun</p>
<p>It is said that the Italian issue is also inconsistent between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. In the future, if the British and American forces actually fight in the Balkans, but because the Soviet Union's influence in the Balkans is too great, the pace of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will be even more chaotic! The upcoming Anglo-American talks will discuss countermeasures for the future war situation, and attempt to compromise the opinions of the anti-Axis forces regarding the Balkan issue.</p>
<p>Moriyama</p>
<p>Yes. However, the Soviet Union strongly insisted that instead of discussing the Italian campaign and the Balkan campaign, they would feel unhappy if they did not first open a second front in France.</p>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the inconsistent futures of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>Moriyama</p>
<p>The Eastern Front, the Sicilian Front, the British and American strengthening of bombing against Germany, etc., seem to have slightly faltered on the Axis side. Therefore, one cannot arbitrarily exaggerate the friction between the Soviet Union within Britain and the United States. But they will never be able to stand on a common front in the future. Their goals, before defeating Germany, are to haggle over post-war issues, which is not the point. Therefore, Stalin boldly took military action without being polite to Britain and the United States. In response, the British and American sides did not pay attention to the Soviet Union's attitude. Only Roosevelt and Churchill held talks. Before defeating Japan, Germany, and Italy, the British and American sides seemed to intend to cooperate. However, there is a fundamental incompatibility between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and therefore various problems arise. But in the future, we believe that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will take a common combat stance and move forward before defeating the Hitler regime. Therefore, it is very dangerous to over-evaluate the intentions of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. (Note: Translated from the August 13th Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Wang Kemin Returns to Beijing After Official Visit, Publishes Impressions <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Beijing, August 18th, Central News Agency dispatch - Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission of the National Government, departed on the 11th to inspect the grain production and purchase situation and local security conditions in various parts of North China. After a week, he returned to Beijing on the morning of the 18th and met with a group of reporters at the Foreign Affairs Building at 4:30 PM to publish his impressions of the visit. He said in general that he had visited Tianjin, Jinan, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, and other places, especially Xuzhou, which is deeply related to the food supply of North China, so he made a special trip to inspect it. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to Japan's implementation of its policy towards China, the national relations between China and Japan have become closer. The people of the two countries are better able to achieve further understanding. Food countermeasures are currently being actively promoted, and all provinces and counties are paying close attention to the food issue. He has been to various places to inspect the actual situation of grain production, purchase, and transportation, especially in the Xuzhou-Huai area, which is the best. Officials in various places are currently working wholeheartedly, so considerable results have been achieved in purchasing grain. As for the security in various provinces, the provincial and city officials are paying great attention, and the police force of the farmers and civilians is gradually being strengthened. At the same time, Japan's implementation of the new policy has made the blind resistance of the surrendered side lose its rational basis. Recently, the number of Chongqing troops who have defected to the peace movement has been gradually increasing, and the communists have suffered a great blow. This phenomenon is promising for the future of security. In addition, the first promotion of the new construction of North China began on the 9th of this month. When the provincial and city officials met in Beijing, they had a full understanding of the significance of the new construction. He saw that all places were implementing it during this inspection, and officials and civilians were working together actively, and great success can be expected.</p>

<p>Amidst the Sound of Joyful Rain</p>
<p>After a long drought, a welcome rain fell for several days. It seemed that not only was the dust of the universe washed away, but also that the hearts of every citizen were slightly cleansed. Although it is not yet known whether this late rain will have a great impact on the autumn harvest, the tiny sprouts of hope are always planted in everyone's heart because of it. In addition, it happened to be the season of festivals, with the Double Seventh Festival and the Beginning of Autumn following one after another. Thus, those who "doubled their yearning for family," those who missed loved ones they had not seen for a long time, those who enjoyed the rain, those who sought coolness, those who discussed savings plans, those who carried out official social interactions, those who lamented the times, those who worried about the world, those who covered new openings, those who appreciated art, those who pursued pleasure and dalliances, those who sought love, those who were confused, and those who were inexplicable—people with all kinds of emotions—were blown by the late summer and early autumn breeze into entertainment venues to while away the long night. As a result, "the seating situation" at the Chang'an Grand Theater on West Chang'an Street "has broken previous records" for several consecutive days (as stated in the "Morning Post" on August 8), and the Xin Xin Grand Theater also "hung up the 'Sold Out' sign long before 8:00 PM" (as stated in the "Morning Post" on August 9).</p>
<p>What kind of tricks are these two theaters playing that can so stir up the proud citizens of the old capital?</p>
<p>Two Theater Troupes</p>
<p>Speaking of which, we should thank the art circles of Shanghai. The "unprecedented success" of Chang'an and Xin Xin is precisely the atmosphere created by the two drama troupes sent from Shanghai. Last year, Tang Huaiqiu, the founder of the China Travel Troupe, brought his group of people to the old capital to show off their skills. At that time, they performed several lively plays at the Chang'an Theater. Unfortunately, last winter, while they were performing "Green Window and Red Tears," the performance was suddenly stopped due to an "accident," and the Tang family and director Dr. Chen Mian also experienced the life of "Green Window and Red Tears." After all, this "accident" is in the past. Thus, the name of the Tang Troupe gave the citizens an even deeper impression. The China Travel Troupe was disbanded. The New China Drama Troupe was then born, which was still a drama troupe centered on the Tang family. After escaping the "accident," the Tang family once performed a "cooperative play" at the Central Park Concert Hall, which was very popular. Recently, due to a dispute over the featured play at the Chang'an Theater, "Heavenly Bull Palace" was moved to heaven. The New China Drama Troupe took the opportunity to occupy Chang'an.</p>
<p>The New China Drama Troupe has performed three plays at Chang'an. The first, "Camille," was already a "very successful achievement." The second, the new play "Canary," was even more moving. A Morning Post reporter even wrote a special critique under the title "After Watching the Heartbreaking 'Canary.'" The third was "Mei Weixiang." This play was Tang's forte, so it is no wonder that it was an "unprecedented success" (as stated in the "Morning Post" on August 8). It is said that after "Mei Weixiang," they will perform "Green Window and Red Tears," which was stopped due to an accident last winter, and then they will go to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Xin Xin has always performed dramas. The 41st Drama Society's "Peking Man" and "Money Mad" were performed at Xin Xin. However, this time, it was the "consecutive full houses" of the Shanghai film star Yan Zhong's China Art Drama Troupe's "Autumn Begonia." This general of the China Travel Troupe has been considered a small star since joining the film industry. It is said that "because movies would bury his talent," he "jumped out of the screen again and returned to the drama troupe" (quoted from the "Morning Post" on August 7, "Introducing the China Art Drama Troupe"). This time, he is indeed coming to the old capital to show off his skills with a "serious" attitude. Before his arrival, there was already promotion. After his arrival, he visited the Morning Post, and the Morning Post on August 7 published a special issue of "Shanghai China Art Drama Troupe Public Performance Special." The date of the first public performance was precisely the night of the Double Seventh Festival. Thus, "long before 8:00 PM, at the entrance of Xin Xin, the 'Sold Out' sign had already been hung up." Not only was it "Sold Out" once on the night of the Double Seventh Festival, but it was also "consecutively sold out." "Autumn Begonia" is still being performed, and it is said that "Three Thousand Gold" will be performed soon.</p>
<p>The Decline of Old Operas</p>
<p>Recently, dramas have indeed been lucky in Beijing. Therefore, the "One Thing a Day" column in the Morning Post said: "The tastes of the audiences in Beijing and Shanghai seem to have suddenly exchanged. Shanghai welcomes operas, while drama and comic operas are quite active in Beijing" (August 8). However, whether this "quite active" is the result of "exchanged tastes" is open to discussion. Beijingers have always been classicists and have always liked old operas. Perhaps only Beijingers welcome "superb skills" like Yang Xiaolou's. However, dramas are now so active. Does this prove that Beijingers' tastes have already changed? By observing the evolution of the theater world recently, we can see that the activity of dramas is enough to prove that Beijingers welcome old operas. These years have always been a bad luck for old operas. After Yang Xiaolou and Wang Youchen, Gao Qingkui, Cheng Jixian, and Yan Jupeng died last year, and Yu Shuyan died this year. Other minor roles are not even included. Those who died have died, but those who are alive are not showing off their skills. Mei Lanfang has long bid farewell to the people of the old capital; Cheng Yanqiu disbanded the Qiuwen Society because of "some kind of stimulus"; Xun Huisheng can be considered quite hardworking, but after "falling ill on the beaches of Shanghai," he did not even have the courage to perform "Huo Xiaoyu." Of the four famous female impersonators, only Shang Xiaoyun is left. However, Shang Xiaoyun is too old after all. Other more famous male performers, such as Ma Lianliang and Tan Fuying, not to mention that they are "barely adequate," even if they are famous actors, most of them are hired and wander around. Only Meng Xiaodong does not leave Beijing, but she does not even open the door often; she does not perform more than twice a year. Under these circumstances, new people are everywhere. No matter how the newspapers promote them as famous female impersonators or famous male performers, in the eyes of ordinary Beijingers, they are "not worth looking at." Beijingers do not dislike old operas, but they dislike old operas that are "not flavorful" enough. Therefore, they have to find another way out for entertainment. The first thing to emerge was the so-called "comic opera." This comic opera was also sensational for a while, but soon the "Heavenly Bull Palace" in Chang'an moved to heaven, and the "Opening the Heavens and the Earth" in the Jixiang Theater in the Dong'an Market went to hell. After the comic opera went bankrupt, it was replaced by dramas. Currently, dramas in Beijing are indeed very active, so active that even Cheng Yanqiu is a little unconvinced. It is said that once Tang Huaiqiu was hosting a dinner party and greatly criticized old operas. At that time, Boss Cheng was sitting there. After hearing these criticisms, he left the table and complained: "That Tang Huaiqiu is really something! Why do you belittle our old operas while you are doing dramas!" (August 3, "Yigong" column in the Morning Post)</p>
<p>The Future of Dramas</p>
<p>But Beijingers fundamentally like flavorful old operas. Therefore, even when dramas were extremely popular, a reporter from the Morning Post helped Cheng Yanqiu by saying: "Those in the drama world and those in the old opera world are all dedicated to art. Although their positions are different, their goals are the same. It is unreasonable to belittle others because of different positions!" (August 4, "One Thing a Day" in the "Yigong" column of the Morning Post) Just a few days ago, the false news in the Real Report that Mei Lanfang had returned to the old capital also stirred up great emotions among the people of Beijing. All of this is enough to prove how much Beijingers miss the "flavor" of old operas. As for whether this taste is wrong, that is another question. We can predict that in the near future, dramas will decline again in Beijing. As for whether they will have to take the path of accepting dramas again due to the lack of old opera talent, it is not something we can know (August 10).</p>

<h3 id="e21">She Yiqian Appointed as Director of the Municipal Security Bureau <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Xu Jinyuan, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Security Bureau, has been honorably transferred to the post of Lieutenant General Staff Officer of the Military Commission of the Executive Yuan. The vacancy of Director has been filled by She Yiqian, appointed by the Central Government. After receiving the order, Director Du officially took office on the 9th of this month. Director Du is a native of Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, and is currently 52 years old. He graduated from the 3rd class of the Baoding Military Academy and previously served as the Lieutenant General Commander-in-Chief of the 8th Route Army Headquarters, the Lieutenant General Chief of Staff of the First Army Group Headquarters, and the Lieutenant General Chairman of the Guangdong Air Defense Committee. He currently serves as a member of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, among other positions.</p>
<h3 id="e22">The Commercial Control Commission Plans to Improve Rationing of Major Food Items <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Proposed a Complete Implementation Plan and Sought to Promote Increased Production</p>
<p>Shanghai News from the Central News Agency – Since the National Government implemented the wartime material control policy to enhance wartime production, stabilize people's livelihoods, and strengthen the organization of economic institutions, the entire statistical organization has been fully completed. Important tasks such as material control purchase and allocation, exchange and operation of materials in various regions of the country, and increased material production are gradually being carried out. Under the guidance of the National Government Material Control Deliberation Committee, the National Commercial Control Commission has gradually implemented unified purchases and allocations for controlled major food items such as flour, wheat, cotton, edible oil, and staple grains. Recently, it has been entrusted by the National Government to purchase and allocate cotton yarn and cotton cloth in a unified manner. Other items such as matches, soap, and native tobacco leaves are also allocated separately. In the future, it will further implement the management and operation of all major materials by the government, and average the allocations. The goal is to eliminate the negative phenomena of hoarding and speculation, creating material panic, and manipulating material disorder in the past, in order to complete the economic construction of Greater Shanghai and even the entire country and Greater East Asia. According to Central News Agency reporters' inquiries with the Commercial Control Commission, there are currently complete and proper implementation plans for the allocation of items related to people's livelihoods such as flour, edible oil, rice, and sugar. It is also planned to gradually improve the current status of allocation to meet the standard of sufficient supply of people's livelihood materials. However, the most important goal in the future is to strive to promote increased production, which is nothing more than investing in rural areas, encouraging breeding, and promoting industrial products to balance the supply and demand of people's needs.</p>
<p>Government Authorities Negotiating with Third-Country Merchants Regarding Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>After the Regulations on the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth were implemented, the cotton yarn and cloth stored by Chinese and Japanese merchants in this city were all included in the scope of purchase. However, due to the fact that extraterritoriality has not yet been abolished for merchants from third countries, they cannot be directly dealt with. Therefore, no decision has yet been made. Among the companies and foreign firms established by third-country merchants in this city, whether they belong to the Axis countries of Germany and Italy or other neutral countries, quite a few have switched to other industries. Whether these commercial firms still have cotton cloth and cotton yarn is worth noting. Therefore, the authorities have already begun negotiations with the diplomatic missions of various third countries in China. Once results are obtained, the authorities will also take strict measures against those third-country merchants who hoard goods.</p>
<h3 id="e23">44th Period Household Rice - Non-Red Rice - Retail Rice Shops Universally Distributing Today <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The 44th period household rice, at a price of six yuan per liter for each coupon, will be distributed starting today and will last until the 24th. Today is the last day for the distribution of the same period's flour, which is half a catty per coupon. The 45th period's flour, which is two catties per coupon at a price of fourteen yuan, is scheduled to be distributed from the 22nd to the 30th. The price, quantity, and distribution period of the same period's household rice will be determined separately. According to a Great Datong News Agency reporter, this period's household rice is pure white brown rice without any polished rice mixed in. If the retail rice shops have red rice mixed in, you can negotiate reasonably.</p>
<p>One More Rationing Period This Month</p>
<p>All of this period's household rice is allocated by the Rice and Grain Joint Venture, totaling 19,070 bags, so each person can only purchase one liter. According to news from the Rice and Flour Procurement Section of the First District Office, there will be one more period of rice distribution this month to adjust the original situation of three periods per month.</p>
<p>Flour Bags Should Be Returned</p>
<p>The Rice and Flour Procurement Section of the First District Office announced yesterday to all flour factories and flour retail shops that starting today, each empty flour bag should be returned to the office. Upon presentation of the office's bag stack receipt, a refund of twelve yuan and two jiao in national currency can be obtained. If the bakery or flour retail shop does not return the empty flour bags, a fine of thirty yuan in national currency will be imposed for each bag.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Reform of Institutions in Old Bureau-Established Schools <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>With the autumn semester approaching for various schools, reporters interviewed education officials in the First and Eighth Districts to inquire about general education facilities for the next semester. They said that all primary and secondary schools established by the former Public Works Department and the former French Municipal Council will be changed to municipal or district-established schools. The administrative structure of the schools will be partially adjusted within the limits of not affecting administrative efficiency. It is noted that there are currently about 150 qualified primary and secondary schools in the First District, including five secondary schools, seven primary schools, and six charity schools originally established by the Public Works Department. Starting next semester, the bureau-established primary and secondary schools will be changed to municipal or district-established schools, and the compulsory primary and secondary schools will be changed to municipal or district-established public night schools. The Eighth District Education Office will formulate expansion and reform plans for the educational administrative agencies and personnel organization, which are expected to be announced soon. The former bureau-established schools, which have been taken over by the Eighth District authorities, include Lagrune Elementary School, Zapo Elementary School, and Remi College, which are currently being reorganized separately. In accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, the Municipal Education Bureau is handling matters for middle and primary school teachers' salaries. It is highly regarded, or may be considered for universal improvement. All schools are currently watching its development.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Receiving Concessions and the Broadcast of the Vice Minister of the New Economic and Industrial Department <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Propaganda Department designated Yuan Ciliang, Vice Minister of the Industrial Department, to broadcast the night before last, discussing the issues of recovering concessions and our country's new grain policy. He said roughly that with the existence of concessions, the strength of the national economy, unknowingly nourishes the concession areas, forming a kind of deformed development, especially Shanghai, because of the existence of concessions, it has become the central place of the national industry and commerce, it can simply be said to be a large reservoir of the national economic power. In the current situation, Shanghai after the incident is the only hub connected to the economic lifeline of the country, equivalent to the power plant that maintains the light of the entire metropolis. If this power plant has obstacles, the entire city will inevitably fall into a dark world.</p>
<p>Now that we have recovered the concessions, the government's greatest mission, it can be said, is how to use the economic power preserved in the concessions, especially the Shanghai concessions, to promote the economic policies under the wartime system, and whether to assist the war or stabilize people's lives, the only effective method is to work hard to increase production. To achieve the goal of increasing production, it is necessary to stabilize prices, so that the activity of real money does not go to speculation and hoarding, but is used in production undertakings. However, during wartime, the consumption power of materials exceeds the production power, and the supply and demand cannot be balanced, which naturally evolves into material shortages, soaring prices, inflation, and unreasonable phenomena such as hoarding by merchants, which are well known to the world. Therefore, the direction of activity of floating capital cannot be directed to unprofitable production undertakings, but concentrates on hoarding goods with guaranteed exorbitant profits, so prices soar day by day, and the evil wind of hoarding becomes more and more intense. If rescue measures are not taken quickly, the so-called goals of cooperating with the war and stabilizing people's livelihoods will be impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>The symptomatic method is to resolutely and strictly restrict the purchase of the largest hoarded materials, so that the targets of hoarding are reduced, and then it can induce floating capital to enter the right track, so that the fundamental method of increasing production can be realized.</p>

<p>Address to Trainees</p>
<p>Under the personal command of Camp Commander Lin Baisheng, the second phase of the New National Movement Youth Corps Summer Training Camp is carrying out active training. Yesterday (18th) at 8:40 AM, Lieutenant General Nagata, Minister of the Shanghai Japanese Army Department, made a special visit to the camp and delivered an address to all the trainees, hoping for the rise of Chinese youth. Minister Nagata roughly stated: "I once served as the commander of a combat army unit and participated in many battles in various parts of the mainland. Only then did I begin to realize that the current Chinese people's views on Japan and the Japanese people's views on China are quite different from those before the war. The reason why both sides are misled is that the United Kingdom and the United States are scheming behind the scenes regarding Sino-Japanese affairs. I realized this in the field command and strongly told my subordinates that we must defeat the United Kingdom and the United States in order to establish genuine Sino-Japanese friendship. I feel even more the necessity of this now. Moreover, this is in line with the great Asianism advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation. China and Japan must recognize that China's enemy is not Japan, and Japan's enemy is not China. The common enemy of China and Japan is actually the United Kingdom and the United States. We must use this new understanding and cooperate to defeat the United Kingdom and the United States. This is the way to love the country. This summer training is based on this great spirit. I can't help but bless the future of China, and I hope that the training can achieve great results."</p>

However, some students who have been approved have sent letters requesting an increase in the scholarship. Due to the regulations, it is not easy to handle. The amount of funds approved for each group of students is based on the students' test scores, school performance, and family situation, after careful consideration, and with the signature of the person in charge. Everything is done fairly, and it is not easy to make any changes. The list of students who have been approved for the examination and assistance is disclosed below:</p>

<h3 id="e38">How to Ensure Capital Security? <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>In its "Prerequisites for Strengthening Production Activities" yesterday, the Continental New Daily believed that the most important factor in promoting production activities is the guarantee of capital security, and that the state of psychological insecurity must be eradicated. Undoubtedly, the state of psychological insecurity stems from the fact that capital cannot obtain security guarantees.</p>
<p>In view of the recent actions of the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank United Reserve Association and the Money Industry United Reserve Treasury to adjust interbank funds, especially the Central Reserve Bank's supply of funds to various banks to support legitimate production undertakings, it is deeply felt that the financial authorities and financial leaders can grasp the psychology of the people in order to strengthen production activities, which is a condition for ensuring capital security.</p>
<p>Taking hoarding daily necessities as a guarantee of capital security is tantamount to quenching thirst with poison, and the result will inevitably be suicide; taking strengthening production activities as a guarantee of capital security, its guarantee power is thorough and infinite, so hoarding gauze is not reliable, hoarding all daily necessities is also not sufficient to rely on, what can be relied on is investing in legitimate production undertakings, "inexhaustible," that is the right way to ensure capital security.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Central Reserve Bank Handles Production Loans for Various Industries <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>In order to adjust funds for various industries and stabilize the market, the Central Reserve Bank allowed the supply of head-office funds to various banks and Zhuanghao for the purpose of handling loans for various industries. The interest rate was particularly low. It was stipulated that all banks and Zhuanghao could apply to the Central Reserve Bank for the supply of funds, and transfer the funds to various industries. However, borrowers should be limited to those who have genuine needs in their own industries. The amount of loan assistance was determined according to the production status of each factory, but the factory companies and firms that wanted to apply for loans must be members of the industry association and have a license issued by the competent authority. As for the transportation of pledged goods, it must not violate current laws and regulations, so as not to promote hoarding and speculation. All cotton yarn and daily necessities shall not be accepted as mortgages. Regarding the discount on physical objects, for goods with limited control, it shall not be higher than six-tenths of the limit, for real estate, it shall not be higher than five-tenths of the estimated value, for stocks, it shall not be higher than three-tenths of the market price, for goods with unlimited credit, it shall not be higher than three-tenths of the market price, and the period shall not exceed three months. Therefore, some factory companies and firms have already obtained loan assistance from various banks and Zhuanghao for purchasing raw materials and increasing production.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Raw Materials Unified Collection and Distribution, Factories Start Work <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>In the spring of this year, factories in the city were forced to stop work or reduce production due to a lack of raw materials. Since the establishment of the Twenty-two Industry Federation and the Four Professional Committees, the raw materials required by each factory have been uniformly purchased and distributed by the members of each Industry Federation and Professional Committee. Therefore, the panic of lack of raw materials has been relieved. At present, all large and small factories in the city are starting work. According to a survey, the current situation of various essential commodity factories is as follows:</p>
<p>Oil Pressing Plant</p>
<p>Currently, there are five or six factories in operation. The Oil and Cotton Professional Committee is actively purchasing a large number of raw materials such as soybeans, sesame, rapeseed, and peanuts from North China, and some have already arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Textile Factory</p>
<p>Most of them have started work. Once the new cotton appears on the market, production will be stepped up. The Cotton Industry Committee is actively collecting cotton in various producing areas in accordance with the unified teaching plan that has been drawn up.</p>
<p>Flour Mill</p>
<p>This spring's wheat harvest was abundant, and the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has distributed 8 million packages of wheat to various factories. Currently, the factories are stepping up flour production day and night.</p>
<p>Silk Factory</p>
<p>The spring cocoon purchase has been completed. The China Silk Industry Association has received 10,000 loads of spring cocoons. Currently, there are three silk factories in operation, producing about four loads of silk per day. As for the small factories in the city, the relevant authorities intend to adjust them in order to save production costs. The detailed measures are currently under confidential consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Encouraging Farmers to Increase Production and Sales; Adjustment of Cotton Prices; Banks Provide Loans for Universal Purchase <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>In order to encourage farmers to increase cotton production and facilitate the sale of produce, relevant authorities will adjust cotton prices to facilitate the purchase process. The authorities also plan to assist cotton merchants in the purchasing process. If they encounter insufficient funds, they can apply for loans from banks. The procedures are similar to those for wheat loans, that is, merchants issue a promissory note and seek discounting from banks such as the Communications Bank. The bank then sends the note to the Central Reserve Bank for rediscounting.</p>
<p>All Factories Preparing to Fully Resume Operations</p>
<p>Previously, major yarn factories reduced production due to insufficient raw materials. Now, cotton raw materials are uniformly allocated by the Cotton Industry Commission. As new cotton is about to enter the market, factories will immediately fully resume operations once they receive sufficient raw materials and strive to increase production to meet wartime needs. Currently, factories are repairing machinery and preparing for production. It is reported that Shanghai Chinese-owned yarn factories currently have 1,395,664 spindles and 16,675 looms.</p>
<p>Authorities Plan to Increase Production</p>
<p>The Cotton Industry Commission is currently actively carrying out purchasing operations in the cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces in accordance with the cotton purchasing control plan. The cotton collected from various places is uniformly concentrated in public warehouses. Yesterday, a cotton industry authority stated that in order to supply wartime needs, the central authorities are currently formulating a production increase plan to expand cotton fields, plant superior seeds, irrigate with scientific methods, and hire experts to serve as technical designers, so that this year's cotton production can be increased by 30% compared to previous years, and the Hua Zhong production area can have a harvest of 440,000 dan.</p>

<p>Shanghai is the economic center of the country. After the war, the financial situation became extremely chaotic, directly and indirectly affecting the lives of the people. In order to stabilize Shanghai's financial situation, the central government had previously banned the buying and selling of enemy currency. However, it was found that a few unscrupulous merchants were still trading in secret. The Second Police Bureau of the Municipal Government yesterday specifically instructed its subordinate branch bureaus and district police bureaus to strictly investigate and prohibit the buying and selling of US dollars and Hong Kong dollars within their respective jurisdictions.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Stock Market Trends <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market initially rose, then entered a consolidation phase. The trend for the day was high to low, with a brief period of stability at noon. In the afternoon, the market saw renewed selling pressure. Although there were buyers looking for bargains, selling pressure from those forced to liquidate due to tight credit conditions overwhelmed the market. As a result, most stocks saw slight declines. Amidst general uncertainty, New China Construction and Jianye traded the most actively. Their prices initially showed weakness, but around noon, news of capital increases and stock bonuses led to large-scale buying, pushing prices up by several yuan, approaching the XX mark and showing a unique surge. Jiuan Industrial remained around the X range. Dazhonghua Industrial also rumored a capital increase, and its price was firm and stable. China Investment traded at 22. Xinyi Real Estate once approached X but then declined. Xinhua Real Estate both saw gains. Among the old stocks, New Pharmaceutical was the strongest, trading around the FX mark. Xinyi, New Star, and others also closed flat. In the department store sector, Wing On and Sincere lost small amounts. New Sun halted trading due to shareholder changes, and some transactions occurred around the X mark. China Underwear also carried out a capital increase, with trading still taking place outside the X mark. Jingfu remained stagnant, while Jinglun showed weakness. In the textile sector, Wing On Textile fell another half a percent to the XX mark. Maya New Stocks traded around XX. Xinyi, Lunhua, An Sheng, and Dazhonghua Textile saw slight fluctuations. Five Harmonies was stable. New Family Industry Stocks saw buying interest lift prices outside the X mark. Xilin Canned Goods saw more demand than supply outside the X mark. Weisheng reached nearly the XX mark. Standard Flavoring and Kangyuan Cans both saw declines. Dazhonghua Match remained stagnant around the 4 mark. Nanyang Tobacco saw selling pressure pushing prices down to the X mark. Public utilities showed mixed trends. Zhabei Water and Electricity declined slightly, while Huashang Electric rose slightly. Public Motor traded at 33. In the cultural sector, Zhonghua again approached X, closing slightly lower XX in the morning. World and Yongxiang Printing traded around the previous day's prices. Jinshun Paper and Standard Paper both saw declines. Huajin Land traded actively at X. Xiang Sheng and Shanghai Tricycle saw trading similar to the previous month. Other stocks generally showed weakness. Zhongfa Pharmacy was the sole investor. Xingzhong Zhenye's new shares, which have not yet obtained a business license from the Ministry of Industry, actually entered the market and began trading.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Rational Countermeasures for Financial Institutions <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>After the implementation of the cotton yarn and cloth purchase program, financial institutions in Shanghai and other places suffered a great blow. It is said that dozens of them were forced to suspend operations or go bankrupt. This incident clearly shows that these financial institutions were engaged in abnormal business operations on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The banks and money shops directly affected by the cotton yarn and cloth purchase program were those that held cotton yarn and cloth themselves or made loans secured by cotton yarn and cloth. These banks involved in hoarding and speculation were mostly small and medium-sized banks, which did not have a large amount of deposits. Because those small and medium-sized banks simply do not have the ability to attract deposits. Using their own funds to engage in speculation, even if they suffer losses and suspend operations or go bankrupt, it will not have a significant impact on the entire financial sector.</p>
<p>Some people believe that after the implementation of the cotton yarn and cloth purchase program, in order to prevent financial fluctuations, financial institutions should be reorganized and integrated. However, in the case of China, because the inherent characteristics of banks are strong, it is ultimately impossible. If mandatory reorganization is implemented, it will only allow unscrupulous schemers and parasites to reap the benefits. Large banks that can be integrated do not need to be because they are substantial. Small and medium-sized banks that need to be integrated have funders and operators with hometown, kinship, and industry connections. Integration would not only be difficult but also meaningless.</p>
<p>The most rational countermeasure for financial institutions is to let them be naturally eliminated. The Ministry of Finance's intervention in the Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank can be said to be the most appropriate method. This method itself can prevent financial chaos before it happens. The Ministry of Finance must adhere to this policy, consistently implementing it through the Central Bank, while also guiding banking associations, in order to unify this policy. Many small banks should be allowed to be naturally eliminated. Unstable banks caused by illegal behavior should be handled by the banks themselves. This is the most necessary financial policy at present. (Translated from the August 18th Continental News) (Yun Yu)</p>

<h3 id="e46">The Establishment and Content of Teacher and Staff Consumer Cooperatives <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Tong</p>
<p>At this time of high prices and shortages, teachers and staff bear the heavy responsibility of educating young people and lead an unusually difficult life, which is widely admired and sympathized with by society. Mr. Jiang Tong and Shou Tong discussed the establishment of a teacher and staff consumer cooperative. This newspaper has previously provided opinions. Recently, Mr. Jiang submitted another article for discussion. This newspaper is pleased to publish it here and hopes that people in the education field and enthusiastic people in society will give concrete opinions on this proposal. This newspaper will publish them and discuss them together to achieve its early realization and reduce the burden of life for teachers and staff. — Editor's Note</p>
<p>I recently published an article entitled "A Preliminary Proposal for Establishing a Teacher and Staff Consumer Cooperative in Shanghai," which aroused discussion in various quarters. The "Short Commentary" in the Central Daily News also made a strong statement and provided good opinions. Now, I would like to elaborate and explore further on the cooperative itself.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the cultural life of the nation, and to enable the cultural life to continue to grow and develop, the cultivation of cultural education must first be taken care of. Shanghai is now very different from its pre-war educational ventures, whether you're looking at the educational facilities or the treatment that teachers are receiving. As of today, a university professor's income is less than that of a rickshaw puller, and an elementary school teacher's monthly salary is lower than that of a nanny. With the lives of teachers so insecure, how can one expect them to engage in the sacred cause of education with a sound frame of mind? In order to help solve the problem of teachers' and staff's livelihoods, reduce the burden of their lives, it is necessary to organize a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff in this city.</p>
<p>The purpose of a consumer cooperative is to avoid the exploitation of merchants and to directly purchase necessities from producers at a lower price. The Shanghai Teacher and Staff Consumer Cooperative is the same in nature and purpose. This is a self-initiated organization to solve practical life problems, and its contents are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Purpose: Purely for the sake of teachers' and staff's livelihoods, using the collective power of teachers to buy cheap goods, such as agricultural products from the interior and material allocations from the authorities, to be fairly distributed to cooperative members by the cooperative.</p>
<p>Position: It is an autonomous organization for teachers and staff, economically independent, and has nothing to do with politics.</p>
<p>Organization: Elect ten well-known and impartial people from the education sector to manage the cooperative. All Chinese teachers and staff currently serving in the city's large and small schools for more than six months are eligible to join the cooperative.</p>
<p>Scope: Includes teachers and staff themselves and their families.</p>
<p>Funds: (A) Each member (i.e., teacher or staff member) must subscribe for one share, totaling 200 yuan, of which 100 yuan can be borrowed from the school. (B) Student parents must advance funds, tentatively set at 100 yuan per college student, 70 yuan per middle school student, and 30 yuan per elementary school student. Those who cannot afford to pay may apply to the school for exemption. (C) Openly accept voluntary donations and loans from people in the business community. (D) Seek the voluntary sale of works and paintings by famous professors.</p>
<p>Allocation and Purchase: The cooperative applies to the authorities for permission to allocate daily necessities, such as rice, oil, sugar, and cloth. The cooperative also sends staff directly to various production areas to purchase in bulk and then distribute.</p>
<p>Distribution: Distribution targets are each member and their parents, spouse, and children. The amount of distribution for each member is limited, but those who are not direct family members (i.e., not parents, spouse, or children) are not eligible for this benefit.</p>
<p>Collection and Distribution of Funds: Funds are collected by the schools and deposited in a designated bank. Open donations and proceeds from voluntary sale are managed by the cooperative, and the accounts are absolutely open. A certified public accountant audits and reports every month.</p>
<p>Investigation: The number of members and their family members is reported truthfully by each school and confirmed by the cooperative.</p>
<p>Transfer and Restrictions: The establishment of the cooperative is permanent, but the persons responsible are changed once a year. (Student parents' advances and loans are settled once a year.)</p>
<p>The above organizational outline is the result of repeated discussions between me and several colleagues in the education field.

<h3 id="e51">A Visit to the Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Catholic Church <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Operating schools, hospitals, factories, and rescuing women, children, the poor, the sick, and prisoners</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the cross on the top of the Catholic Church radiated the brilliance of the rising sun. The melodious sound of the bell slowly spread. Quietly, the Tianjin Catholic Church Street began to bustle with a group of people struggling to survive. Chinese and foreigners, men and women, old and young, with a zeal for life, walked through the gate of the Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Catholic Church. But, who would have noticed that behind this gate, there is a myriad of worldly affairs! And even a paradise in the hell of this world!</p>
<h3 id="e52">A Paradise in Hell <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Sacred Heart Church's work to save the lost began more than eighty years ago. In 1856, it was founded in Paris by the French female philanthropist Ougenie (Sister Superior). It is dedicated to serving women and children in misery. Because both in China and abroad, among the poor masses, women and children lived in the hell of hell. The Sacred Heart Church's benevolent work was immediately supported by all walks of life. Not only in France, but also in other countries around the world, it was established. In China, Sister Superior came to China to establish the Sacred Heart Church to save lives. The first institution established was the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Church, followed by the Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Church, the Hongkou Kunshan Road Sacred Heart Church, the Yangzhou Sacred Heart Church, and the Hebei Xianxian Sacred Heart Church. The Sacred Heart Church's work to help the poor laid a solid foundation and developed.</p>
<p>The Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Catholic Church, founded by Sister Dominick in 1871 after the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Catholic Church, has been around for seventy-three years now. At the beginning, there were only a few huts. Foreign nuns worked hard to adopt orphans and went to the slums in Yangjingbang to diagnose diseases and dispense medicine from time to time, gradually gaining the belief and love of the masses, and the cause also developed greatly. Philanthropists from France and other foreign countries donated one after another. In less than ten years, this towering Sacred Heart Cathedral building was built on this ancient Catholic Church Street, and the charitable works it undertakes also developed rapidly.</p>
<p>The undertakings of the Zejingbang Sacred Heart Catholic Church are quite extensive, with special emphasis on receiving infants in misery, educating Chinese and foreign orphans, teaching and providing relief to the poor, providing skills and medical care, and protecting female prisoners. From a regional perspective, the Sacred Heart Catholic Church on Tianjin Catholic Church Street includes: a destitute orphanage, a refugee relief center, Xiaoming Girls' Middle and Elementary School, Qian De Elementary School. Outside the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, leased for operation are: the Ren Ci Tang Children's Clinic, the Yangjingbang Catholic Women's Association, the Ren Shan Nursery, the Ren Shan Civilian Factory, the Ren Shan Clinic, Qiu De Girls' Middle and Elementary School; Chong Zhen Elementary School; Xiaoxing Elementary School; Ren Ji Clinic; preaching and treating diseases in the women's prison. Seeing the breadth of its charitable undertakings and the spirit of its earnest management, it truly deserves to be called a paradise in the hell of this world.</p>
