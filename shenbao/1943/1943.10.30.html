<h3>社評　把握住必勝的鎖鑰　對於日本八十三屆臨時議會的感想</h3>
<p>日本第八十二屆臨時議會，巳於二十六日開幕，至一十九日圓滿結束。此次臨時議會之召開，在世界戰爭進入決戰階段之時，在東亞民族臨於總動員爭取最後勝利之時，其憲義之重大，無待贅述。綜觀此次臨時議會之成果，殊足以使東亞民族解放前途，拓展坦蕩之境。我們特別感到有為國人告者，約有如下諸端。</p>
<p>八十三屆臨時議會所完成之第一個重要任務，為加强日本國內決戰態勢，集中總力確保勝利，通過國內施政要綱的諸重要法案及預算案，以適應時局之緊急需要而保障在未來決戰中的勝利。就當前時局而論，誠如東條首相所指示的，敵人英美，因犬東亞各民族以帝國為中心團結愈益緊密及豐富資源與戰力之愈益充沛，而不擇手段，企圖反攻，今後戰事旣將日趨激烈，則日本乃至東亞諸國，自應猛然警覺，振奮起各國的總力，予敵人以最後之一舉。現在日本為此，業已努力强化國內決戰體制，舉其要者，厥為刷新官廳事務，實現行政決戰化，設置農商軍需及運輪通信三省。同時擴大國民動員，停止學生等一般之徵集延期制度，擴大微用範圍，統一國內防衛方策，特別設立防空本部，並決定疏散城市人口，凡所以强化國內態勢而集中總力以應付未來決戰者，都已澈底在實行中了。</p>
<p>我們於此欽佩日本政府的英斷。爲完遂戰爭而必須强化國內決戰政治的種種非常措施，絕不猶豫遲疑而迅速決定實施。誠如東條首相所指出，「當此緊迫時機，吾等國民所應盡之責任，亦僅有急速增加戰力之一途，迅速繼績整備摧毀英美之必勝戰力，以應前綫之要求。惟盡責任，決非易事，如前之所思所行，決不能有所成就，必須全體國民眞正袪除一切惰性，排除一切障碍，傾舉一切力量，方可有成。」我們一方面認識日本國家組織之完密，國民擁護國策之忠誠，另一方面認識日本當局信賴國民與尊重民意的精神。即以此次決定强化國內決戰態勢諸政策而言，鄭重召集議會討論，東條首相自始至終主持會議，披肝瀝膽的向議員剖陳時局，縷析政策，解答貴問，籲請議員協力。惟有如此，惟有澈底實現政府與民衆的充分協調合作，才能傾舉全國總力，以貫澈一切政策，而爭取最後勝利。此實值得我國當局深思熟慮而有以取法。</p>
<p>東條首相鄭重說到：「關於改訂中日條約事宜，最近即將具體化，余對此為達成「中國人之中國」之理想，及為大東亞十億民衆之解放而邁進之氣魄，衷心表示敬意。」又說，「當此之際，兪方仍在兄弟閱牆，不得參與中國史生之雄圖，更不能復事大東亞民族共同事業，余實表遺憾·但對渝方治下之民衆，則深其同情之念·」我們對於這幾句話，不勝感觸！關於中日條約之根本改訂，不久即可具體化一點，實為今日我國朝野一致之期待，亦為促進中日兩國新關係，尤其是促進中國全面和平的重要因素！「中國人之中國」的理想，以及對渝方統治下民衆之同悄，尤將激起我全國一致之激舊。我們深信，「中國人之中國」的理想與大東亞戰勝之勝利，是不能分裂的整體，我們要從這裹担負起新的任務。</p>
<p>日本此次臨時議會中，東條首相詳述日本協助中，滿，泰，緬，菲島，馬來，蘇鬥答臘，爪哇，婆維洲，西里伯乃至印度民族獨立之政策，宜示將進一步增進其福社，「使萬邦各得共所，使兆民悉安其堵」，不僅為日本肇國之大理想，並為建設基於這義的新世界的前提。此次議會終於通過了大東亞總動員案，而關於大東亞民族政策的六項原則：　取消人種差別，　民族平等互讓，　實行經濟提携，　發展並溝通文化，　解放資源，　共同防衛大東亞等，有明確之討論。所有這些，實爲東亞十億民族打成一片，共同擊滅敵人，永久解放東亞及樹立世界永久和平的基本條件。從這裹，更看出此次議會在世界民族史上劃時代的意義，不只是對英美一種政治攻勢中的最有力的武器而巳！</p>
<p>從日本第八十三屆臨時議會的成就，可以明白的看到，未來決戰中打開最後勝利之門的鑰匙，已經把握在我們東亞民族的手裹了！今日我們對國內必須加强政府與民衆的團結，促進全國統一和平；對國際建立中日新關係，促進東亞十億民族的總力。只有這樣，才能永遽把握住必勝的鎗匙！但是東條首相說得對：「戰局之演變，決不許吾人有寸刻之猶豫」，願國人猛省！</p>

<h3>中日改訂條約　交涉頗順利　極短期內即將實現</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　甘束條首相於二十六臼在第入十三屆臨時議會席上發表之施政淀說中，有謂　於中日基本條約之根本改訂最近巳貝且體化，汪主席前次蒞臼訪問時，會輿余就中。日兩國完成共同戰爭方策，竭誠交換意，，結果雙方意見已趨一致。現中·日兩方均極力期待束條首相之聲明能於最近期內實現，着汪主席司於九月問蒞日訪問，勾留期間、雖僅兩日，除拜會日天皇陛下外，並與東條首相，重光外相，靑木大束亞相舉行長談後，即於二十三日離日返國，於安返南京後，會發表重要談話。又日駐華谷大使會於上月中旬返日，達日與各方磋商要務，公畢當即赴南東返任，近正與國民政府進行折衝，雙方交涉進行極為順利。按日本之正式表示意見，認為適應大東亞戰爭勃發後之新情勢，日方對中日基本條約買有加以改訂之必要者，乃為本年一月九日中國參戰後日本政府所聲明，日本在該聲明中龍：為適應中日關係今後之發展，關於既定各項條款、應從新加以考慮。又束條首相復於本年六月十六日在日本第入十二屆臨時講會席上發表施政演說，其中有鑼：日本擬對中日問之條約加以根本之改訂，使兩國協力態勢更趨緊密。束條首相聲明以後，甘本態度更趨鮮明，最近中日兩國　局問已依照右項聲明之旨趣，進行各項交滲，預料必將於最近付諸實現。</p>
<h3>滿食糧增產</h3>
<p>新京二十九日中夾社電　滿洲國為謀積據增產食糧，菸本年初即已衛立戰時艇產物緊急增產方策以後，除開墾荒地設置自給農塲以擴充耕地外，並濱極促進軍位面積之收獲量，迄今已得確保其增產目標。今當秋收之期上市情形，較往年爲佳，收買目標已可保不成問題，日本之對滿期待量亦　保無虞。至於明年之增產對策，乃以確保食糧自給爲目標，主要者除促使本年度實施之戰時農產物緊急增產方策更趨澈底外，並計劃由土地開發公司及滿拓等機關，積極實施改良土地開拓水出·此外並以二年計劃在第二松花江下游及東遼河地區，大舉開拓新耕地若干公頃，並期以增產米作爲中心，導入日本開拓民及勤勞奉公墜。關於此點，雖尙需要由日本輪入資料及技術人才，但此巳於武部總務長官訪日之時獲得解決。因日當局重行聲明決予滿洲增產計劃以絕大協力，故今後較日本內地迅速增產餘力之滿洲農業發展實堪期待，從而日滿共同確保食糧自給計劃亦可早獲成果</p>

<p>國府當局談話　　華中　縣公司我國政府當局談話如下：我國自參加大東亞戰爭以來，舉凡軍事上政治上經濟上一切均有　於友邦之支援，我國政府亦正集中全力，以　在此戰時體制下完遂此項重大之任務承友邦於我國參戰後交還租界撤廢治外法權。以完成中國獨立自主必須且備之條件。茲復積極協力，將事　後中日合辦之各公司予以調　，使我政府政治之滲透，以及經濟之復興，民心之把握，均獲有莫大之援助，實為感謝。近來華中方面之華中　業公司及華中蠶絲公司，已獲得具體之解決，雙方意見一致，華中鹽業公司，日本方面所有股份悉數議與我國，成為我國經　之公司、其華中　絲公司，則將公司解散原以有資產交還出資之各股束。迥溯華中　業公司，創設於民國二十八年八月問，當時海州鹽塲經事變及風潮災害之損失，踓田幾　荒廢、該公司以運鹽機　隨時貸　塲商補助鹽民，俾仍能從事生產，使華中一帶需要之鹽不慮缺乏，且以餘力對日本　出工業用　，並兼營大浦新鹽田及　鹽工廠，以技術上之改　爲我國之　獻、誠有足沭者。此次經友邦美意，將日方股本移　中國、改組爲我國官商合辦之公司、定名爲中華鹽業公司。我政府自當督飭新設之中華公司，按照原來之使命按　推　，且謀更大之發展，所有從前華中鹽業公司計劃建設中之苦　原料兩廠。亦由中華鹽業公司繼續與友邦合作，另組新公司經營之，其大浦新鹽田精鹽工廠，並將由中華鹽業公司委託此新公司綜合經營，以日方之技術爲中國鹽田之改善，與鹽類化學工業之進展。</p>
<p>至華中　絲公司係民，正常中國　絲　萎靡不振之時，該公司對於中國　絲業力謀發展，並由日本輸入　良　穗，改良中國原有　種　資增產，得以蘇保中日織維資源，其　獻殊多。此次友　並將該公司予以解　。將其製絲事業移交中國方向實施、我政府自當督飭　絲幾加緊努力，以求健全之發展，至絹布短織維等之生絲精裝事業、在中國尙在試騐過程中，仍有賴於日方之支援，將以新企業之形熊設計經營之、</p>
<p>以上兩公司經生次調　後、我國政府益感今後責任之加重，惟有盡其全力積極運營，一方面使我國經濟趨於復與，一方面　日本諾要得以供給，俾職時體制下之生產方，日有增加、藉副友邦　烈之期待。</p>
<p>日方當局談話</p>
<p>日大使館發表關於　聲華中　業及華中　絲業之談話如下：國民政府還都以來，已三年有餘工因獲得一般中國民衆全面的支持，及上海其他各方面有力實業界人士之協力，故其基礎益趨　固，本年一月九日國府　英美宣戰，參加大東亞戰爭後，其多年　案如收囘租界撤廢治外法權等問題，亦一舉而獲解決，並舉北總力完遂共同戰爭邁進於大東亞建設，此劃期的活　於焉開始。</p>
<p>自中日合辦公司實施調整以來，諸項車要企業漸歸中國政府並民間有力實業家經營，此在國府洵屬可慶可賀，關於各公司調整之具體方案。中日當局及關係方面，仍在協議中，關於華中　業公司及華中　絲公司之意見已完全趨於一致，前者日本方面已將其所有股份完全　濺於中國，改由中國公司經營，後者則將該公司解　，所有財產悉歸還於各投資者。</p>
<p>華中鹽業公司建設並計劃中之以苦滷爲原料之化學工塲，鑒於其事機之性　決定方針，另設中日合辦之新公司　行經營，以華中　業公司所有之　田並精鹽工廠，委托該和公司以期與新化學工塲能綜合經營，並以日本之技　而使中國之製監方法及　化學工業等，得以進步發展。華中囂絲公司今次之交涉結果而解散，其製絲事業委諸中國方而，惟絲終於親布短　維及生絲加工事業等新技術上說，現尙未脫試騐　　。似　參加日本的技術與資本者，以　的企業形態經營之，中國蠶絲業則確保東亞資料。</p>
<p>但其使命至爲重大，深望今後加倍努力，促成　絲業之健全發展。</p>

<p>第二陛段，為現在戰局敵方是在謀回復其生產。今年之敵方生產力巳這項點，故彼舉全力以反攻，但日方不斷粉碎敵之戰力，對無蠶大價値之島漸以至必要地，以减少損失戰門力，並使敵方無鎮消耗艦以及人力實源，時南方庫，化我方生這力，方面實行大東亞之政治攻勞南方實益加强大，在人的方面亦然可赴綫之兵力，尤其是空軍方面，吾人極有生之參加戰綫南經開始對於和銳之兵力，有極大自信，大東亞共榮各國勞動之參加作戰體制亦完成，總之從人力物力兩方面而觀，　最近之將來，敵我之戰鬥力，當有極利用防禦戰術所獲得之人力，物力在該時將以如何形式出現，成為何種兵器出現下尙朱能告，但必可預料敵人被逐太平津及印度洋。</p>
<p>第三階段</p>
<p>第一階段第二能依照預定方針遂行，故獲得最後勝利之第三階段當亦可依照預定劃實現，大亞各國之立係表示大東亞對於數之偉大政攻勞，例如之獨立及印度時政府之成立等，即為大東對於英榨取之反攻，如此吾人方面在戰鬥力上粉碎敵人時在政治經濟上基於義精神，立大東亞共榮圈，深信以大東亞之力最，必能獲致最後勝利。</p>
<h3>出淵報道部長講述　南太平洋戰况　日軍出血戰略成功</h3>
<p>中央社訉　上海陸軍部報道部出淵部長，昨在陸海外聯合報道常會發表四南太平洋方面所羅門及新幾內戰况詳，茲分誌如次，</p>
<p>必勝不敗</p>
<p>出淵部長首謂：自本年春日軍四太平洋方而朱予以進展，而敵方則乘機動，此種狀况，在戰爭現階段中當有之現象。我方早已料所及，以準　充分特展開張有力之習禦作戰　，相常激烈，當戰爭之初。日軍即完成必勝不敗　　固地位，最初即獲得大勝，反　敵方則受挫大敗，乃不得不從事　允，　圖挽囘危局、以消　過去失收、於是作反攻之舉，在我人檢視敵方反　狀況而觀，我方事先已有預定充分之計劃、按照計劃以　，如爪這爾加納爾反攻之事實，及敵方克復所羅門幾小島與新幾內亞島之極小部份，敵方運用鉅大力量，僅取得極小戰果，故在我方之戰爭，早巳獲得　大戰果，在南方四南太平洋，均建立戰果頗多，將戰略根據地之克復，惟在本月份起，戰况較為減少，總之敵方此次反攻，實不能言為反攻之事實。</p>
<p>出血戰略</p>
<p>再觀過去敵方在所羅門島新佐治亞島之　逮，新幾內亞島之　賴摩之發動攻勢，頗為渺，但在我方駐在兵力雖戰不。足以從容抵抗敵大隊人馬，與之交戰，相時在兵力雖薄，而發揮强大力量，故我方所採取之出血戰略，實能發揮百分之百之效力，故敵方之欲獲取一島，先須耗費龐大空軍兵力，繼須大隊軍人作戰，自我採有此項戰略後，敵寰遭受慘重創傷，結果仍歸失收，斷就敵方飛機損害之此例，則我方為一，而敵方居其四，損害巨大，於此可見。同時日軍敵方損害　落飛機五，沉擊舟挺五十艘，死傷士一萬四千名以上，總之，敵方之反攻　無收獲而損失慘重。　敵方一貫之目的，乃欽蹀向日本土作總反攻之舉，此實可謂無可能性。　在敵方旣不能進展而又增加損失，但在我方則充分利用大東亞內之物資　戰威赫赫，準備於未凍予以迎頭痛擊之總反攻。</p>
<p>預定計劃</p>
<p>今我方採取攻勢，作防禦戰，盡量將大東亞各地確保，且努力减少我方之損害，予敵人極大之打擊及重大之創傷，此乃出血戰略方面則勞力凖　作今後總力反攻，此全依照預定之作戰劃。再前幾日為美國海軍紀念日工前美駐日大使格　。再度戰告美民衆之　計播，謂日海軍力量之戰大無匹，惟至何時作發動攻勢之舉，尙難料想，故為戰略上之計劃，於此已見美國內深　日本之力量，雖美國表面上雖强白樂觀，其實中心惴惴，對日本實相當怕　也。</p>
<h3>大東亞圈　團結堅固　廣田課長談話</h3>

<p>廣田情報髁長，昨在陸海外報道常會席上、就記者　提出之訽問，說明大東亞團內各國之團結　固强化，廣田課長首謂，自日對美宜　後、日即不承認國際聯盟組織，繼廣田氏又謂、束亞各國由於國家集團關　上在大東亞共內又加强團結足以較大東亞共榮圈外之團結更為強大同時圖內之各團結且更加强樞紐，異常堅固，此事余當予說明之，最後氏謂此種之團結，余斷言較國際聯盟組更為堅固。</p>

<p>經濟界</p>
<h3>評言　雲霓之望</h3>
<p>處於今日國民經濟之戰時形態中，就是最大多數的貧乏與困苦！我們對於戰時經濟政策之全面實施，是朝夕抱着雲霓之望。「最大多數的中國人民」，芷如本報福評以前說過，「今日是最低限度的生活水準之下掙扎着。因此，當局對於促通國民戰時經濟生活，使國民忍痛耐苦，一方面應該用勸募，　　和鼓勵方法，一方面更應　時詳察民隱與不平，務求人人為國家民族與東亞之解放而奮門，沒有人可以巧取豪奪，獨獲暴利。」</p>
<p>人生最雖消受者為飢寒。人民儘可承受戰醫生活之犧牲，可是。最低限度的溫飽，畢竟是為能不顧到的。因此，自從巨口米制度實施以還、我們最大的渴望，就是民食問題之獲得相當妥善的解決；自從棉紗布數買以後、我們最大的濁望，就是合理的紗布配給方案之早日公布實施。如今，由於上海　食配給調　會與米統會之協力，戶口米之配給數量，在短期內，每月每口可逐漸遞增至六升以上，從此滬市民食當可無憂，而黑市米價自當劃烈挫跌了：由於物資統制審蟻委員會與商統會之協力，紗布實施配給民用的辦法，一俟今日修正通過後，即將公佈實施了。以上兩個消息，一關民衣問題的善後，一關民食問　的解決，自足以差慰我們雲見之望，祇是配給棉紗布，增加戶口米以後，這須注意於未雨綢繆之計，使解決民衆饑寒之米與布的供應，能夠特之以久恒，所以，不伯要來　　　年五年之米與棉紗布的生產計劃纔好。</p>
<h3>銀錢業準備　安渡十底比期　新信用放款決酌予貸放</h3>
<p>滬工商業十底比期巳屆，各行莊對於到期之長期信用放欵，分別通知淸償以守信用。惟信用素著之老戶，凡具有正當用途者，準予通融。必須將以前應付之</p>
<p>利息償淸</p>
<p>另訂新貸放契約，利率依照市面酌予提高。至於新和信用放欵在緊縮原則之下酌予貸放，但對於審查則特別審愼，以社利用行莊資金，從事投機　積，以上舊欵</p>
<p>通融展期</p>
<p>以及新貨欵手續，必須於寸底以前完全辦竣。所以連日各行莊因卞底比期問題甚為忙碌，現欵之收解與票據之交換領驟增，並　整個金融市塲因中央儲備銀行及銀行聯合準備會錢業準備庫之調劑得力，</p>
<p>依然穩定</p>
<p>銀根反較以前爲鬆。至各滬劉錢莊對內之結息則依照公會內盤行市七元五角結算。故各業之安渡十底，決無問題。</p>
<h3>烟藥統制將　成立新機構</h3>
<p>關於烟藥統制事宜，將由中日烟商合作以一年萬元之資金組織一新機構，由此新機構負責進行統制收買及配給。在此新機構之下，日商方面即由中支會社參加，我華商方面將由各製烟廠合組聯合會，參加此統制機關。聞此項計劃在今日南京召開之物資統制審議無會中，可以提出審議。</p>
<h3>華中鹽業公司　即將改組</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　華中鹽樂公司創設於民國二十人年人月二十一日，當時因各處鹽民散失，鹽田幾瀕荒廢，該公司以運鹽機構性毶，臨時貨欵鹽塲商，補助各鹽民，俾使仍能恢復舊觀，從事生產，使華中一帶食鹽供應無感缺乏，且向日本輸出禽鹽，除此並　營大浦新鹽塲及精鹽，對我國鹽業技術改善，頗多貢獻。此次友邦方面股份移　國府後，將改組為中華官商合辦之臨業公司，定名為中華業業公司，循以往之使命，更作進一步之發展。</p>

<h3>饑饉的印度</h3>
<p>— 丹羽吾</p>
<p>在未到度之前我決不想到民在過那梯悲慘的生活。以前大概不這的吧有那麼優秀的哲學，文學建築，學，以及宗教的國家，怎會到現在的地步不能不是非常奇怪的擁有度斯坦原的北部印度土地廣，人口多，民自然不能說是裕，他們居住於問狹小的土屋中，能夠有塊粗布裏的巳算很好了，全家七八糟的和泥土黏在起，過着不生的生活在天氣朗的日子，沙濛四而糊，如在雨天則水滔滔成小河道路不辨完全不像朋人居住的部落像電氣等設當然沒有取馬以取煖，點着種子油的燈。</p>
<p>農民貧不聊生</p>
<p>因爲貧困的故，如施肥等方法是從來不曾想到的，耕種方法亦不　究，每英　的收獲關比任何地方為低。在這烈日滬射下的土地上，水利之便從不加以考慮，灌溉祗有十五六政府對那些事情不注意唯知榨取那麼何故把印度當作英國的寶庫而守，恐有失呢？那是因為而織，口多的且在米，麻絕對　鉅小每年有四十五六萬可供出是每個民是那樣貧但那些事情是從來不加者的祗要能增加就好了。以前秀的民族，如何到步，簡地説乃是社會機構，級制度的缺陷在僧階級有婆賴米武士階級有庫希耶特利亞商階級有派伊夏，奴婢有特拉，這四個階級分得極嚴密而淸楚，世代相不進取的象完全被阻止拿於宗殺的上來說，宗殺上有所謂退斐，那就是指今日的度之落的悄形這也是實但我殺說比這要大的原因，我想斷言那是英國的帝國主義。是才　泰利的组織。</p>
<p>租稅承包制度　　這名詞還是到印度來之後才知道的。那是稅承包制度。那制度是從有名的勃拉茲希會戰中獲得勝利後的克拉普所開始的。他戰敗了法屬和土侯，掌握霸權，即用其權勢開始這制度。其意思是把一定的土地的租稅，使一定的人承包承包人祗繳納一定的租稅，就能自由處分其土地也可以割成一小塊一小塊分貨於他人。而貸得再可分於他人。於是其價格層層遞增上去，民的佃租也依着比例層層加上去。土地分得愈零碎，農民愈繳納次租稅，甚至經五十人的手。從徵親賦的方面說來，沒有樣苛的组織不能確保這樣多的財源。這雖是束印度公司之有力的財產，在今日為英國實富的源泉農民辛苦苦地耕種出來的作物，自已的家裹不能到手，全部被剝去了。度人雖種出作物但所種出的不是自己的束西。借錢這價務愈積愈重在借價中生，在借中生活，而把務留傳於子子孫孫以至於死。遺種農民在印度最盛的北部度，孟之北最多現實比想像中的要慘苦。與其說他是生，不如說是在死的前日。</p>
<p>軍需品供給地</p>
<p>英帝國的實，其土地的人民是在餓死綫上。平時即已百四十年十月二十五日，亞歷山大傑士到新德里來指導舉行束方需會集了英本國及其他殖民地政府的代者，討論蘇士以東的英屬領之需品的自給自足於是決定從度應供出，小麥，年常設東方需評議於新德里。印度成爲需品的供給基地，因而向各屬領船船的滿而出數極夥到非洲，到亞送到軍隊中去於是度國內的物資缺乏遂甚嚴重因日軍進擊，緬旬卒告獨立以前每年從緬甸入的五十萬噸米，亦告斷絕食糧的，乃極形嚴。加以度在日的壓制下，沿岸航路不斷受威脅，陸路則極不自由，故物偏於地不能公佈</p>
<p>孟加拉的暴動</p>
<p>最近常有種種傅說，孟加拉洲因食糧不足而發生暴動。百分之九十三的印度人是文盲而又貧窮。那暴動大概是餓死之前的浴血奮鬥吧！印度人的平均死亡率另爲二十三四·女爲二十四·五，幼兒的死亡率爲世界第一。英國的紳士風度在這裏也顯出眞面目來了。不受印度人怎樣饑荒，他們無動於中。英國且竭力加以彈壓。他們以爲是可以用刀槍解決的。然而澎湃的獨立運動，遍佈全國。現在是印度人本身應該覺醒的時候了。他們正在尋求推進的力量。那是爲了人類的前途。（翔：譯自「朝日週刋」十月三十一日號）</p>

<h3>解決人事問題的基點</h3>
<p>— 楊肅</p>
<p>本月六日申報社評一論兼戰「一文中，於人事問題，再三致意，語重心長，對於今日的政治現狀，可以說是，針見血之談，不過在人事問原解決之際，有個先決問題，必先加以考慮。</p>
<p>最重要最基本的自然是待遇問題。關於問題的理論不必辭費。我們要觀察的是事實。現在公務員的俸給表。是依據民國二十上年的標準，最多遺沒有加上三倍。如上個科長，底薪三百六八十元，連加成約一千一百五十元，平均每天的收入不到四十元，現在客飯每　至少二十元，則供一個人的飯費尚不夠，　論其他的消費，遮論家族的瞻養。科長的地位，不能算低了，等而下之的科員，記更談不到。就是位高於科長的參事司長之類也一樣的同病相憐，愁窮嘆苦。</p>
<p>因爲待遇之不足以維持最低限度的生活，於是今日的公務員就發生下列的現象：第一是　，「地不足，則顧而之他，」這是自然的趨勢。申報社論痛陳兼職之弊，可是現在的公務員非兼不可。上級官，自己去活動兼職又要代部下設法職。下級官，也紛紛鑽營以求兼職兼職愈多，就愈一有辦法所以身兼五職的公務員，在今日恐怕並不稀平心而論，把事業的效率丟開靠出一自己的心血，來幾個辛一苦錢，總是公守法的最要緊的，應該從改善待遇入手第二是溜，公務員的收入，旣不足維持生活，當然不能安於其位，日日求去，於是有機會，就向外發展形成了公務員的逃避現象如就以申報社論提及的米統制會而論，筆者所知該會職員，確有部分是商會舊人，但是轉職而不。戰的原因，也並非興趣問題，而是待遇問題因爲如在商會任斡事月入約六百元，而在米統會的助理員，可以千多元。米統會的待遇，不能算高，以生活指數此戰前高一百倍論，只合二十元可是商食的俸給，的確太低米統會和商會的全持者，旣屬人，那末以久經辛苦的同伴，新缺，原在情理之中。遺不過是個例其餘捨差而就乙缺，捨甲而乙地，捨公務員而改就他業的，更舉不勝舉溜的現象，成爲公務員的出路了第三是庸，有神通的，有辦法的，旣是兼的兼，溜的溜了，下來的，就大半是庸劣無能途窮路末的了。並不是故意輕視公務員，實際情形，確是如此其實社會上對於公務員的輕視，非一日。木匠泥瓦匠要七八十元一，而公務員只須三四十元第四是會，因爲正俸的收入，旣不足口，於是只有找尋外快之途，憑，身歷者不以爲非，旁觀老轉其福官常淪廢綱紀敗壞，益不可問種情形，雖不普遇亦非尠見務員的待遇，政府曾有次加成，今春又公布物資俸給辦法，不能說不關心可是加成的數目遠落於物價上漲之後，而物資俸給，卒以阻梗很多，到現在只有南京各機關，以每石四百五十元的官價，每人配給六斗糙米，也不過是聊勝於無罷今日政府政的困，也是實情，是我們不唱高調，那末，滅少駢枝機關汰冗員，實現行政的简素化，以增加現任公務員的待遇，或者是比較最爲妥的辦法。</p>
<p>待遇問題是人事問的基本，如果合理的待標準不能定，那末任何廉潔政洽的厲行，行政效率的請求，優秀才之羅致，人事管理之實現等，俱將無從談到。點，是值得注意的照常爲貧病服務</p>
<p>社會服務</p>

<h3>Editorial: Grasp the Key to Inevitable Victory: Thoughts on Japan's 83rd Extraordinary Diet Session</h3>
<p>Japan's 82nd Extraordinary Diet Session concluded successfully on the 19th, having commenced on the 26th. The significance of this session's convocation, during the decisive phase of the world war and as East Asian peoples face total mobilization to strive for final victory, needs no elaboration. Overall, the achievements of this session are truly sufficient to broaden a smooth path for the future liberation of East Asian peoples. We especially feel compelled to inform our countrymen of the following key points:</p>
<p>The first important task accomplished by the 83rd Extraordinary Diet Session was to strengthen Japan's domestic war footing, concentrate total power to ensure victory, and pass crucial laws and budget proposals related to domestic administration guidelines to meet the urgent needs of the current situation and guarantee victory in the coming decisive battle. Regarding the current situation, as Prime Minister Tojo has indicated, the enemy, the United States and Britain, is resorting to any means to attempt a counteroffensive, seeing that the East Asian nations, united under the Empire, are becoming increasingly close-knit, and their abundant resources and combat power are growing ever stronger. The coming battles will only intensify. Japan, and indeed all East Asian nations, should be keenly aware and rouse the total power of each nation to deliver the final blow to the enemy. To this end, Japan is already working to strengthen its domestic war system. Key measures include reforming government offices, implementing administrative streamlining for wartime, and establishing the Ministries of Agriculture, Commerce, Military Procurement, and Transportation &amp; Communications. Simultaneously, efforts are underway to expand national mobilization, suspend general student deferments, broaden the scope of recruitment, unify domestic defense strategies, establish an Air Defense Headquarters, and decide on evacuating urban populations. All measures to strengthen the domestic situation and concentrate total power to face the coming decisive battle are being thoroughly implemented.</p>
<p>We admire the decisive judgment of the Japanese government in this regard. Without hesitation or delay, they swiftly decided to implement various extraordinary measures necessary to strengthen domestic war politics in order to complete the war. As Prime Minister Tojo pointed out, "In this urgent time, the only responsibility that we, the people, should fulfill is to rapidly increase combat power, and swiftly continue to develop the inevitable combat power to destroy the United States and Britain, to meet the demands of the front lines. However, fulfilling responsibility is no easy task. We cannot achieve anything if we think and act as we did before. The entire nation must truly eliminate all inertia, overcome all obstacles, and dedicate all our strength to succeed." On one hand, we recognize the completeness of the Japanese national organization and the loyalty of the people in supporting national policies. On the other hand, we recognize the Japanese authorities' spirit of trusting the people and respecting public opinion. For example, regarding the decision to strengthen the domestic war posture, the Diet was solemnly convened for discussion. Prime Minister Tojo presided over the meeting from beginning to end, candidly explaining the situation, analyzing policies, answering questions, and appealing for the cooperation of the Diet members. Only in this way, only by thoroughly realizing full coordination and cooperation between the government and the people, can we concentrate the total power of the nation to implement all policies and strive for final victory. This is truly worthy of deep consideration and emulation by our country's authorities.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo solemnly stated: "Regarding the revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, it will soon be materialized. I express my heartfelt respect for the spirit of achieving the ideal of a 'China for the Chinese' and advancing for the liberation of the one billion people of Greater East Asia." He also said, "At this time, it is truly regrettable that Yu (Chiang Kai-shek's government) is still engaged in internal strife and cannot participate in China's historical grand plan, nor can it join the common cause of the Greater East Asian nations. However, I deeply sympathize with the people under Yu's rule." We are deeply moved by these words! The fundamental revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, which will soon materialize, is truly the unanimous expectation of our country's government and people, and an important factor in promoting new relations between China and Japan, especially in promoting comprehensive peace in China! The ideal of a "China for the Chinese," as well as the sympathy for the people under Yu's rule, will especially arouse unanimous excitement throughout our country. We firmly believe that the ideal of a "China for the Chinese" and the victory of the Greater East Asia War are an indivisible whole, and we must take on new tasks from here.</p>
<p>During the Japanese Diet session, Prime Minister Tojo detailed Japan's policy of assisting the independence of China, Manchukuo, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, Malaya, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, and even the Indian peoples, and indicated that their welfare would be further enhanced, "so that all nations can each find their place, and all people can live in peace." This is not only Japan's founding ideal but also a prerequisite for building a new world based on righteousness. The Diet ultimately passed the Greater East Asia General Mobilization Act, and the six principles of Greater East Asian ethnic policies were clearly discussed:　Eliminating racial discrimination,　Mutual equality and concession among ethnic groups,　Implementing economic cooperation,　Developing and communicating culture,　Liberating resources,　Jointly defending Greater East Asia. All of these are fundamental conditions for the one billion East Asian peoples to unite as one, jointly destroy the enemy, permanently liberate East Asia, and establish lasting world peace. From here, we can see the epoch-making significance of this Diet session in world ethnic history, and it is not merely the most powerful weapon in a political offensive against the United States and Britain!</p>
<p>From the achievements of Japan's 83rd Extraordinary Diet Session, it is clear that the key to opening the door to final victory in the coming decisive battle is already in the hands of us East Asian peoples! Today, we must strengthen the unity between the government and the people domestically, and promote national unity and peace. Internationally, we must establish new Sino-Japanese relations and promote the total power of one billion East Asian peoples. Only in this way can we forever grasp the key to inevitable victory! However, Prime Minister Tojo is right: "The evolution of the war situation does not allow us even a moment's hesitation." May our countrymen be keenly aware!</p>

<h3>Revision of Sino-Japanese Treaty: Negotiations Proceed Smoothly, Implementation Imminent</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) In his policy speech at the 83rd Extraordinary Diet Session on the 26th, Prime Minister Tojo stated that the fundamental revision of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty has recently begun to materialize. When Chairman Wang Jingwei visited Japan last time, he sincerely exchanged views with me on completing joint war strategies between China and Japan, and as a result, both sides' opinions have converged. Currently, both China and Japan strongly expect that Prime Minister Tojo's statement can be realized in the near future. Chairman Wang visited Japan in September, and although his stay was only two days, in addition to meeting with His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, he held long talks with Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and Greater East Asia Minister Aoki before leaving Japan and returning to Nanjing on the 23rd. After safely returning to Nanjing, he issued an important statement. Furthermore, Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani, returned to Japan in mid-September to consult with various parties on important matters. After completing his official duties, he immediately returned to Nanjing to resume his post and is currently engaged in negotiations with the National Government. The negotiations are proceeding extremely smoothly. According to Japan's formal expression of opinion, considering the new situation after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan finds it necessary to revise the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty. This was stated by the Japanese government after China's entry into the war on January 9 of this year. In that statement, Japan stated: "To adapt to the future development of Sino-Japanese relations, the established terms should be reconsidered." Prime Minister Tojo also delivered a policy speech at the 82nd Extraordinary Diet Session of Japan on June 16 of this year, in which he stated: "Japan intends to fundamentally revise the treaty between China and Japan to make the cooperative relationship between the two countries closer." Since Prime Minister Tojo's statement, Japan's attitude has become clearer. Recently, the authorities of China and Japan have been conducting various negotiations in accordance with the spirit of the aforementioned statement, and it is expected that it will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Manchurian Food Production Increase</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) In order to increase food production in Manchuria, the country has been establishing wartime agricultural production emergency increase policies since the beginning of this year. In addition to expanding arable land by reclaiming wasteland and establishing self-sufficient farms, it has also been actively promoting increased yields per unit area. So far, it has been able to secure its production increase targets. The market situation at the time of the autumn harvest is better than in previous years, and the purchase targets can be guaranteed without problems. Japan's expected amount from Manchuria is also guaranteed without worry. Regarding next year's production increase countermeasures, the goal is to ensure food self-sufficiency. The main measures include further thoroughly implementing the wartime agricultural production emergency increase policies implemented this year, and planning to actively implement land improvement and reclamation by the Land Development Corporation and other institutions. In addition, a two-year plan is underway to reclaim several hectares of new arable land in the lower reaches of the Second Songhua River and the Dongliao River area, with the aim of increasing rice production, and introducing Japanese settlers and labor service corps. Although this still requires the import of materials and technical personnel from Japan, this has been resolved during the visit of Chief of General Affairs Takebe to Japan. As the Japanese authorities have reiterated their determination to provide strong support for Manchuria's production increase plan, the agricultural development of Manchuria, which has more spare capacity for rapid production increase than mainland Japan, is worth looking forward to, and the joint Japan-Manchukuo food self-sufficiency plan can be achieved sooner.</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Authorities Release Statements Regarding the Transfer of Japanese Shares in Central China Salt and Silk Companies to China</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - To promote the economic development of our nation, our ally Japan has decided to transfer all Japanese-owned shares in the Central China Salt Company and the Central China Silk Company. The Ministry of Finance held a press conference yesterday, the 29th, at 3:00 PM, attended by both Chinese and foreign journalists. Chief Secretary Cha, representing Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance, made the following statement: The Central China Salt Company was established in October of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), jointly operated by China and Japan to restore salt production in the Haizhou salt fields. Through diligent management, Central China has not faced a salt shortage in recent years. Now, with the transfer of shares by our ally, the company will be reorganized as the Sino-Chinese Salt Industry Company, a joint official-private enterprise, which will be established soon. It is expected to have a significant impact, not only solving the salt problem in Central China, but also maintaining the same policies regarding industrial salt for our ally. Furthermore, our ally will also transfer its silk industry to China. A new organization is currently under consideration by the relevant authorities and is expected to be established within this year. The Ministry has already established a special tax office for silk industry development in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, with branches in the Ministry and Guangdong. Xu Jiang has been appointed as the director of the special tax office for the three provinces, and Li Dong as the deputy director and head of the Guangdong branch. Direct collection will increase tax revenue from silk, and the Ministry will do its utmost to revitalize the silk industry.</p>
<p>Government Authorities' Statement Regarding the Central China Salt Company</p>
<p>The statement from our government authorities regarding the Central China salt company is as follows: Since participating in the Greater East Asia War, our nation has received support from our ally in military, political, and economic affairs. Our government is concentrating all its efforts to fulfill this important mission under the wartime system. Our ally has returned concessions and abolished extraterritoriality after our participation in the war, fulfilling the necessary conditions for China's independence and sovereignty. They are now actively cooperating in adjusting the various companies jointly operated by China and Japan after the war, which greatly assists our government's political penetration, economic recovery, and popular support. This is deeply appreciated. Recently, concrete solutions have been reached for the Central China Salt Company and the Central China Silk Company in Central China. Both sides have reached a consensus that Japan will transfer all of its shares in the Central China Salt Company to China, making it a Chinese-owned company. The Central China Silk Company will be dissolved, and its assets will be returned to the investors. The Central China Salt Company was established in August of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). At that time, the Haizhou salt fields had suffered losses due to incidents and disasters, and the fields were almost abandoned. The company provided salt transport machinery, loans to field operators, and subsidies to salt farmers, enabling them to continue production and ensuring that the salt needs of Central China were met. Furthermore, it exported industrial salt to Japan and also operated the Dapuna new salt field and salt factory, contributing to technical improvements for our country. This is truly commendable. With the good intentions of our ally, the Japanese share capital will be transferred to China, and the company will be reorganized as the Sino-Chinese Salt Industry Company, a joint official-private enterprise, named the China Salt Industry Company. Our government will supervise the newly established China Salt Industry Company to continue its original mission and seek greater development. The potash and raw material plants planned by the former Central China Salt Company will continue to be developed by the China Salt Industry Company in cooperation with our ally, forming a new company to manage them. The Dapuna new salt field and fine salt factory will be entrusted to this new company for integrated management, using Japanese technology to improve Chinese salt fields and advance the salt chemical industry.</p>
<p>As for the Central China Silk Company, when the normal Chinese silk industry was declining, the company strived to develop the Chinese silk industry and imported superior silkworm eggs from Japan to improve the original Chinese breeds and increase production, thereby securing Sino-Japanese textile resources. Its contributions are considerable. This time, our ally will dissolve the company and transfer its silk business to China for implementation. Our government will supervise the silk industry to intensify efforts for sound development. However, the production of silk fabrics, short fibers, and refined raw silk is still in the experimental stage in China and still relies on Japanese support. It will be designed and operated in the form of a new enterprise.</p>
<p>After these two companies are adjusted, our government feels the increased responsibility in the future. We will do our best to actively operate, on the one hand, to make our economy tend to recover, and on the other hand, to supply Japan's needs, so that production under the wartime system can be increased daily, in order to live up to our ally's ardent expectations.</p>
<p>Statement by Japanese Authorities</p>
<p>The Japanese Embassy issued the following statement regarding the Central China Salt Industry and Central China Silk Industry: More than three years have passed since the National Government returned to Nanjing. Thanks to the comprehensive support of the general Chinese public and the cooperation of influential industrialists in Shanghai and other fields, its foundation has become increasingly solid. After the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9th of this year and participated in the Greater East Asia War, long-standing issues such as the recovery of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality were resolved in one fell swoop, and the epoch-making act of marching towards Greater East Asia construction by exerting all-out efforts in the joint war began.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the adjustment of Sino-Japanese joint ventures, key enterprises have gradually been managed by the Chinese government and influential private industrialists. This is truly gratifying for the National Government. The specific plans for the adjustment of the companies are still under discussion by the Chinese and Japanese authorities and related parties. The opinions on the Central China Salt Industry Company and the Central China Silk Industry Company have completely converged. The former has had all its shares completely transferred to China by the Japanese side and will be operated by a Chinese company. The latter will be dissolved, and all assets will be returned to the investors.</p>
<p>Regarding the chemical plant that uses bittern as raw material, which is under construction and planned by the Central China Salt Industry Company, the policy has been determined based on the nature of the project: a new Sino-Japanese joint venture will be established to operate it. The salt fields and refined salt factory owned by the Central China Salt Industry Company will be entrusted to this joint venture so that it can be integrated with the new chemical plant. With Japanese technology, Chinese salt production methods and salt chemical industries can be developed. The Central China Silk Company will be dissolved as a result of this negotiation. The silk business will be entrusted to the Chinese side. However, in terms of new technologies such as silk fabrics, short fibers, and raw silk processing, it is still in the experimental stage. It seems that enterprises in the form of participation in Japanese technology and capital will be operated, and the Chinese silk industry will ensure East Asian materials.</p>
<p>But its mission is extremely important, and it is hoped that redoubled efforts will be made in the future to promote the sound development of the silk industry.</p>
<h3>Advisor Ishiwata Discusses Chinese Finance</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (China-Japan News Agency) - Mr. Shotaro Ishiwata, the highest economic advisor to the National Government, arrived here the other day to hold key discussions with the Japanese government. Today, the 29th, he met with a group of reporters at the Imperial Hotel here to issue a statement about the recent economic situation in China. The gist of the statement was that the foundation of the National Government's finances has been further strengthened by the abolition of extraterritoriality and taxation rights. Once the tax system is straightened out, it is expected to contribute even more to the political power of the National Government. The compulsory procurement of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has been carried out very smoothly. As for other essential living materials, an investigation is underway following the method of procuring cotton yarn and cotton cloth. Furthermore, the fixed price for procuring rice for this year has been determined by the Rice and Grain Control Council and procurement has begun on the 20th. It is expected that procuring rice at the fixed price will yield good results, as prices in Central China have dropped sharply and prices have stabilized due to the implementation of procuring cotton yarn and cotton cloth. Bank deposits have also increased accordingly.</p>

The results are quite promising.</p>
<h3>Japanese Americans Detained in the United States Refuse to Work to Protest Unfair Treatment by Administrators</h3>
<p>Argentina Township, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to news from San Francisco: Approximately 1,000 Japanese Americans detained in the Strike Isolation Camp in California refused to engage in agricultural work a few days ago to protest the unfair treatment by administrators. The isolation camp was recently established to transfer 7,500 Japanese Americans from various concentration camps to this place under the unwarranted charge of being "disloyal elements". Among them, there are even Japanese born there. This time, more than a thousand people went on strike during the harvest of agricultural products, making it difficult for administrators. They have been working hard to recruit laborers from various places. A spokesman for a certain administrative authority said that although the striking Japanese Americans refused to work, there have been no riots so far. The direct cause of this strike was a military truck accident that killed one Japanese coward and injured several others.</p>
<h3>German Troops in Southern Italy Hold Firm: Intense Battles in the Upper Reaches of the Futo River</h3>

According to reliable sources, the current German front in Southern Italy is as follows: From west to east, the entire line roughly extends along the northern part of the Campania Plain, continues to cross the middle section of the Apennine Mountains, through the area near Campobasso, and straight down to the Adriatic coast between Termoli and Vasto. Each road in the mountainous area of this war zone is favorable for defense, as they are all fortified with artificial bunkers everywhere. These figures also said that the key point of Isernia may be the target of the anti-Axis attack on the Western Front.</p>

<h3>German Reinforcements Arrive in the Nogais Steppe for a Counteroffensive: Tank Battles Unfold in the Fight for the City of Kerch</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - Transocean News Agency: The Soviet army is continuing its offensive on the eastern Qiannan Road, and the battles are most fierce in the Nogais Steppe. The flat terrain is the most ideal place for tank and mechanized forces to fight. The enemy is transferring reinforcements to join the battle. In Melitopol, the Western army has penetrated into our army's positions and is now attempting a fan-shaped advance. There are currently two vanguard units of the Soviet army in the far south, one targeting Kenigsberg and the other advancing southwest along the Leccop Isthmus, attacking west and northwest, targeting the Lower Dnieper River between Nikopol and Bolsral. However, their concentrated pressure is also encountering strong counterpressure from the German army, as large German reinforcements have also arrived to stop their progress. The enemy launched another offensive between Crimea and the Lower Dnieper River yesterday morning, and fierce battles are still underway. The situation in the Dnieper River remains unchanged. The German positions east of Krivoy Rog and Zappruki were subjected to strong attacks the day before. There were only local battles in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River. The Soviet army's offensive against our positions north of Gomel was unsuccessful. The Soviet army's attempts to break through west of Krichev and east of Orsha were also unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - A war report from the Supreme Headquarters stated that west of Melitopol, the Soviet army launched an attack to break through the gap, but was repelled. The offensive and defensive battles north of Krivoy Rog have become a tank battle, and fierce battles are currently underway.</p>
<h3>The Future of the War is Still Favorable to Germany: Goebbels Publishes Essay</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to the Transocean News Agency, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the latest issue of "German Weekly" stating that German generals are still paying attention to the Soviet Union's continuous resources, so the German military's operational plans still focus on the Eastern Front. The military positions that the people wanted to rely on in Western Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, and Southern Europe during the "Second World War" are now still in German hands in the fifth year of this war. Furthermore, during the First World War, the enemy was not under pressure from the Japanese army in East Asia. Now, Japan is also fighting with our country, which weakens the strength of the Allied countries a lot. The domestic situation in Germany in 1942 is also different from that in 1918. There is no opposition force. The whole country is under the guidance of the National Socialist Movement, and the people are united. Therefore, the enemy's so-called German "military and industrial circles have friction" is purely their fantasy. The occasional fatigue after long-term operations may exist, but this can also be seen in the enemy's camp. The special allocations during the Christmas season can prove that Germany's food situation is still extremely stable in the fifth year of this war, the military machine is also extremely complete, the people are also strong, and the strength of defensive warfare is increasing day by day, giving the enemy significant losses. It concludes by saying that the air raids on the enemy will also be retaliated against.</p>

<h3>Additional Postage Surcharge of 100% to be Implemented Starting Next Month, November 1st</h3>
<p>Shanghai. The political and business management bureau, in order to collect postage surcharges, issued a notice yesterday stating: "Starting November 1st of this year, a new surcharge of 100% will be added to the basic postage and existing surcharges listed in the fee schedule for all types of mail in the first category (local delivery within the city), second category (domestic inter-bureau mail), fourth category (Japan, Korea, Kwantung Leased Territory, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), and fifth category (Macau and the Shanghai Concession)."</p>
<p>Talk from Postal Authorities</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to the person in charge yesterday, who gave the following statement: "This increase in surcharges is truly a last resort. In recent years, commodity prices have soared, some exceeding pre-incident levels by hundreds of times, while current postage rates have only increased tenfold. This has resulted in severe deficits for postal bureaus across the country, making it impossible to make ends meet. Therefore, we had no choice but to submit a request to the Ministry of Construction, which was then forwarded to the Executive Yuan, to double the current postage rates, which is only twenty times higher than before the incident, to make up for the losses. However, this will undoubtedly increase the burden on the people. We sincerely hope that postal employees will work even harder and be more dedicated, overcoming all difficulties, to achieve the highest standards of service to the public, so as not to fail the government's mandate and the public's expectations." The revised fee schedule for various types of mail is listed below:</p>

<h3>City Propaganda Department Convenes Second Regular Press Conference to Discuss Municipal Issues</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report. The City Propaganda Department convened its second regular press conference at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 29th) in the City Government Conference Room. Reporters from various newspapers attended, including Sun Ming from the Chinese Department of Domei News Agency, Cheng Yiping from the Central News Agency, Jiang Lingzhang from the China Daily News, Liu Han'er from Shen Bao, Tang Xiongfeng from Ping Bao, Xu Wei from Xin Zhong Guo Bao, Cao Youzhi from Xin Kai Bao, Liu Xinggong from Guomin Xin Kai Bao, Yamazaki from Dalu Xin Bao, and representatives from various agencies: Secretary Ma Mingfu from the City Government Secretariat, Liu Wenzhen from the Food Bureau, Yu Pingshan from the City Baojia Association (represented by Qi Tianliang), Suo Chen, Director of the Health Bureau, and Fang Qian, Section Chief of the City Propaganda Department, totaling more than twenty people. Director Liang, head of the Propaganda Department, presided over the meeting. Representatives from various agencies answered questions raised by the newspapers. The questions and answers are recorded below:</p>
<p>Clearing Garbage in the Southern City</p>
<p>China Daily News asked: "Garbage piles up in the Southern City, which hinders the appearance and sanitation of the city. How will the Health Bureau address this issue?" The Health Bureau replied: "The Sanitation Office of the Southern City drafted a plan in March of this year to thoroughly reorganize the sanitation of the Southern City and submitted it to the City Government for approval. Subsequently, the City Government decided to first start with clearing the accumulated garbage in the plan, and work began on May 13th. By June 10th, the accumulated garbage in all listed locations had been completely cleared. However, due to excessively low wages for sanitation workers, they have been leaving one after another, resulting in an inability to clear garbage daily and the appearance of accumulated garbage. The completion of sanitation tools is underway. In areas far from the terminal, temporary dumping grounds are set up, transportation is organized, and garbage boats are used to solve the garbage disposal problem. Restricting the time for dumping garbage, setting up public trash cans, and supervising shops to provide their own trash cans are all measures that can be implemented one by one once funding is sufficient."</p>
<p>Prohibiting Smoking and Gambling</p>
<p>China Daily News asked: "The prohibition of opium smoking and gambling has been repeatedly proclaimed, but has not yet been thoroughly implemented. What specific measures does the City Government have in this regard?" Ping Bao asked: "Strictly prohibiting smoking and gambling is an urgent task in the process of actively building a new Shanghai. What measures will the authorities take and when will they be implemented?" The reply was: "The government is well aware of the harm caused by smoking and gambling. In the past, due to the city's financial situation, gambling taxes were levied in the Southern City. Recently, the special tax in Zhabei has been stopped. Efforts are now being made to offset the impact in the Southern City, and the prohibition is scheduled to be implemented by the end of the year. As for opium, it is a special tax levied by the state and is absolutely prohibited, which must wait for the country to be relatively prosperous. However, the sale and smoking of opium by the Central and South Central News Agencies have become an open secret, and strict orders have now been issued to prohibit it."</p>
<p>Resolving the Coal Briquette Panic</p>
<p>Xin Zhongguo Bao raised four questions, which were answered by the City Government Secretariat. "How to resolve the coal briquette panic?" (Answer) "The coal briquette panic is caused by a shortage of supply and coal merchants hoarding goods for speculation. The only way to solve this is to clear the supply channels and suppress prices. The government is paying attention to the investigation and research in cooperation with relevant parties." "The black market for cigarettes is rampant. Has the City Government already taken over the market and implemented price controls?" (Answer) "Cigarettes are also within the scope of price controls. As for cracking down on the black market, the police agencies will be ordered to strictly enforce the law." "Has the merger of the Eighth and Thirteenth District Public Offices been decided, and has the merger date been determined?" (Answer) "The City Government has decided to merge the eight districts, but the date is still under consideration." "How to resolve the edible oil panic?" (Answer) "We are currently studying methods with the relevant parties in the Chamber of Commerce to hopefully increase the supply, and the panic can be reduced."</p>

<h3>Lieutenant Shi Yan Talks About the Pacific War Situation, Crushing Enemy Counterattack Attempts</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report. Lieutenant Shi Yan, representative of the Fleet Press Department, gave a detailed report on the Pacific war situation at yesterday's Army and Navy Joint Press Conference. Lieutenant Shi Yan stated, "In the South Pacific, the enemy's counteroffensive operations are becoming increasingly fierce. We can also foresee that the enemy will attempt to push forward in the Western Pacific. The enemy country is mobilizing its total production capacity to produce aircraft to use in Japan's occupied territories. Once occupied, they will immediately establish air bases there, adopting the so-called 'island hopping' strategy. The most intense enemy counterattacks are aimed at Rabaul in New Britain, attempting to recapture it. Therefore, they are constantly bombing various places in the Southeast Pacific, such as Bogenville and Finschhafen, and sending large formations of aircraft to attack the Gilbert Islands and Makin Island in the central Pacific. In order to hinder Japan's production capacity, they are also fiercely counterattacking areas such as the Celebes and Borneo, which are rich in resources. Their intention is nothing more than to make up for the losses suffered at the beginning of the war, using aircraft and warships manufactured at the highest level of production to suppress the Eastern Pacific, cut off Japan's connection with the south, and eliminate Japan's war power. Therefore, they disregard any sacrifices, concentrating their forces in the Southeast Pacific, and adopting aircraft carrier-based guerrilla warfare in an attempt to sink Japanese ships.</p>
<p>Planned Strategy</p>
<p>In a nutshell, if the enemy does not take advantage of the current opportunity when their production capacity is at its peak, they will never be able to cut off Japan's connection with the South. But in fact, the enemy's production capacity has already reached its peak this year. The Japanese side is crushing the enemy's counterattacks everywhere, achieving brilliant results. Japan had already anticipated that the war would develop to today's stage before the war, and had a predetermined operational plan. If people deeply desire to achieve final victory, they must go through the following stages, and they are already in the plan.</p>
<p>First Phase</p>
<p>The first stage is to ensure the resources needed to maintain the war effort. In order to cope with the two major empires of the world, it is necessary to ensure the resources needed to maintain the war effort. Therefore, the Japanese army made every effort to occupy the South and tried its best to bring the front line closer to India. Therefore, there must be an air raid on Hawaii and an air raid on Midway and the Indian Ocean naval battle. It is also necessary to crush the enemy's production capacity before establishing the sure-win state of the Greater East Asia War. This battle plan has been successful.</p>
<p>Second Phase</p>
<p>The second phase is the current battle situation where the enemy is trying to recover its production. This year, the enemy's production capacity has reached this point, so they are using all their strength to counterattack. However, the Japanese side continues to crush the enemy's war power, and gradually reduces the loss of war power by reducing the value of islands to the point of necessity, and prevents the enemy from consuming warships, manpower and material resources. At the time, the South was used as a warehouse to convert our production power, and the political merits of Greater East Asia were implemented, and the South was actually strengthened. The same is true in terms of manpower. Our extremely capable students will participate in the front line's southern economic war, and we are extremely confident in our participation in the sharp military strength on the front lines. The system for participating in the war by the labor of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity nations is also complete. In short, from the perspective of both human and material resources, in the near future, the enemy's combat power will be extremely effective. How the human and material resources obtained through defensive tactics will appear at that time and what kind of weapons will appear next cannot be told, but it can be predicted that the enemy will be driven out of the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Third Phase</p>
<p>The first and second phases can be carried out in accordance with the predetermined guidelines, so the third phase to achieve final victory can also be realized in accordance with the predetermined plan. The establishment of Greater Asia reflects the great political merits of Greater East Asia for a number of achievements. For example, the independence of Great Britain and the establishment of the Indian Provisional Government are the counterattacks against the British exploitation of Greater East Asia. In this way, while our side crushed the enemy in combat power, it established the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere based on the spirit of justice in politics and economy, and deeply believes that with the power of Greater East Asia, we will be able to achieve final victory.</p>
<h3>Director of the Press Bureau, De Yuyuan, Speaks on the South Pacific War Situation, Japanese Army Bleeding Strategy is Successful</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report. Director of the Press Bureau of the Shanghai Army Department, De Yuyuan, gave a detailed report at the Army and Navy Joint Press Conference yesterday on the Solomon and New Guinea war situations in the South Pacific. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Victory and Invincibility</p>
<p>Director De Yuyuan first stated: "Since the spring of this year, the Japanese army has not made progress in the four Pacific directions, and the enemy has taken advantage of the opportunity to move. This situation should exist in the current stage of the war. Our side had already anticipated this and fully deployed a strong defensive operation, which was quite fierce. At the beginning of the war, the Japanese army completed its must-win and invincible position, and initially achieved a great victory. On the other hand, the enemy suffered a setback and a major defeat, so they had to engage in a campaign to try to recover the situation and eliminate past losses. Therefore, they launched a counteroffensive. When we reviewed the enemy's counteroffensive situation, our side had a predetermined and adequate plan. As we implemented the plan, such as the fact that the enemy captured a few small islands in the Solomon Islands and a very small part of New Guinea, the enemy used tremendous power to achieve very small results. Therefore, our side had already achieved great results in the war, and established many strategic bases in the South and South Pacific. However, since this month, the battle situation has been less intense. In short, the enemy's counterattack cannot really be described as a counteroffensive."</p>
<p>Bleeding Strategy</p>
<p>Looking back at the past offensives launched by the enemy in the Solomon Islands, New Georgia Islands, and in New Guinea, they were quite small. However, the troops stationed on our side were not strong enough to easily resist the enemy's large forces and engage them in battle. At that time, our troops were small in number, but they displayed great strength. Therefore, the bleeding strategy that our side adopted was able to exert 100% of its effectiveness. Therefore, in order to capture an island, the enemy must first expend enormous air force power, followed by large numbers of troops to fight. Since we adopted this strategy, the enemy has suffered severe wounds, and the result has still been a loss. Judging by the example of enemy aircraft damage, our side was 1, while the enemy was 4. The damage was enormous, as can be seen from this. At the same time, the Japanese army damaged and shot down 5 enemy aircraft, sank 50 ships, and caused more than 14,000 casualties. In short, the enemy's counteroffensive achieved no results and suffered heavy losses. The enemy's consistent goal is to launch a general counteroffensive towards the Japanese mainland, but this is really impossible. While the enemy cannot make progress and is increasing losses, our side is making full use of the resources within Greater East Asia to prepare for a counteroffensive that will deliver a head-on blow to the enemy.</p>
<p>Planned Strategy</p>
<p>Now our side is adopting an offensive posture, conducting defensive warfare, making every effort to secure various parts of Greater East Asia, and striving to reduce our losses, while inflicting great blows and significant wounds on the enemy. This is the bleeding strategy, while preparing for a full-scale counteroffensive in the future, all in accordance with the predetermined war plan. Also, on the previous day, the former US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, issued a warning to the American public once again, stating that the strength of the Japanese navy is unmatched, but it is difficult to predict when it will launch an offensive. Therefore, in terms of strategic planning, it can be seen that the United States is deeply wary of Japan's power. Although the United States is ostensibly strong and optimistic, its heart is filled with apprehension and it is quite afraid of Japan.</p>
<h3>The Greater East Asia Sphere is Firmly United: Talk by Section Chief Hirota</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report. The Japanese side held a joint press conference by the three authorities of the Shanghai Army and Navy yesterday (29th) at the Hui Zhong Hotel, following the usual practice. The Army Department Press Bureau was attended by Director De Yuyuan and Trustee Akahoshi. Fleet Department Press Bureau Director Matsushima returned to Japan on official business and was represented by Lieutenant Shi Yan, as well as reporter Uzaki, Mr. Wang Bingnan, and representatives from the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, including Chief Hirota of the Information Section, Consul Fukuma, and others. Fleet Department Press Bureau representative Lieutenant Shi Yan and Army Department Press Bureau Director De Yuyuan successively gave reports on the Pacific war situation. Chief Hirota then answered questions from the press corps on the unity of spirit within the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere in great detail. The conference ended at 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>Chief Hirota of the Information Section, at the Army and Navy Press Conference yesterday, explained the strengthening of the unity of various countries within the Greater East Asia Sphere in response to questions raised by reporters. Chief Hirota first stated that since Japan declared war on the United States, Japan no longer recognizes the League of Nations organization. Hirota further stated that the countries of East Asia have strengthened their unity within the Greater East Asia Sphere due to national group relationships, which is more powerful than the unity outside the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. At the same time, the unity of each group within the Sphere has been strengthened, and the hub is extremely strong. He would explain this further. Finally, he stated that he asserted that this kind of unity is more solid than the League of Nations organization.</p>
<h3>Grain Control Committee Takes Over Grain Warehouses in Various Districts, Selecting Cadres to Go and Take Inventory</h3>
<p>After the former Rice and Grain Joint Management Society was ordered to close, the Food Ministry and the Grain Control Committee have determined, through consultation, how to handle all the goods and items stored in various districts and other locations. It is approved that the Food Ministry will transfer all goods stored in various locations such as Nanjing and Hubei to the Grain Control Committee for management. The committee has already selected capable personnel to go to the various locations yesterday to work with the directors and deputy directors of the offices to inspect and take inventory. In addition, the Grain Control Committee previously issued identity cards to the preparatory committee members of the Rice and Grain Purchasing Industry Association in various districts. Because these cards still need to be submitted to the Liaison Department of the Friendly Nations for registration and stamping to demonstrate solemnity, the committee has notified the preparatory committee members who have already received identity cards to return the identity cards they have received as soon as possible, and to submit a photo.</p>

<p>Economic Circle</p>
<h3>Commentary: Yearning for Rain Clouds</h3>
<p>In today's wartime state of the national economy, the greatest majority suffers from poverty and hardship! We look forward to the comprehensive implementation of wartime economic policies with the yearning for rain clouds. "The vast majority of the Chinese people," as this newspaper's commentary has said before, "are struggling below the minimum standard of living today. Therefore, while the authorities are promoting wartime economic life among the people and encouraging them to endure pain and hardship, they should use persuasion and encouragement, and at the same time, they should promptly investigate the people's hardships and grievances, and strive to ensure that everyone works hard for the country, the nation, and the liberation of East Asia, and that no one can take advantage of the situation to seize and hoard wealth and obtain windfall profits."</p>
<p>The most difficult things to endure in life are hunger and cold. The people can endure the sacrifices of wartime life, but the minimum level of food and clothing must be taken care of. Therefore, since the implementation of the giant-mouth rice system, our greatest desire has been to obtain a reasonably satisfactory solution to the problem of food for the people. Since the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth has been restricted, our greatest desire has been for the early announcement and implementation of a rational yarn and cloth allocation plan. Now, thanks to the cooperation of the Shanghai Grain Distribution Adjustment Association and the Rice Control Association, the amount of rice distributed per capita per month can be gradually increased to more than six liters in the short term. From then on, the food of the people of Shanghai can be worry-free, and the black market price of rice will plummet sharply. Due to the cooperation of the Materials Control Review Committee and the Chamber of Commerce, the method of allocating yarn and cloth for civilian use will be announced and implemented after it is amended and passed today. The above two pieces of news, one concerning the follow-up of the people's clothing problem and the other concerning the solution to the people's food problem, are sufficient to comfort our longing. However, after allocating cotton yarn and cloth and increasing household rice, we must pay attention to planning for the future, so that the supply of rice and cloth to solve the people's hunger and cold can be lasting. Therefore, it is best to have a five-year production plan for rice and cotton yarn and cloth in the coming year.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Prepared: Safe Passage Through the End-of-the-Month Period; New Credit Loans Granted Discretionally</h3>
<p>The end-of-the-month period for Shanghai industry and commerce has arrived. Various firms and businesses have notified those with long-term credit loans due to repay them to maintain credibility. However, established customers with a good credit history and legitimate uses for the funds will be accommodated. They must:</p>
<p>Repay Previous Interest Due</p>
<p>A new loan agreement will be drawn up with the interest rate increased appropriately based on market conditions. As for new credit loans, they will be granted selectively under a tightening principle. However, examination will be particularly thorough to prevent use of firm and business funds for speculation and hoarding. Extending old loans and processing new loans must be completed before the end of the month. Therefore, various firms and businesses have been very busy these days due to the end-of-the-month period. The receipt and disbursement of cash and the exchange of bills have increased sharply. However, the entire financial market remains stable due to the effective regulation by the Central Reserve Bank and the Joint Bank Preparatory Committee's money industry reserve.</p>
<p>Financial conditions are even looser than before. As for the settlement of interest among Shanghai money houses, it will be settled according to the internal market rate of 7.5 yuan per tael set by the association. Therefore, there is no problem with various industries safely passing through the end-of-the-month.</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Drug Control: New Organization to be Established</h3>
<p>Regarding tobacco and drug control matters, a new organization will be established through the cooperation of Chinese and Japanese tobacco merchants with a capital of 10,000 yuan. This new organization will be responsible for conducting controlled purchasing and distribution. Under this new organization, the Japanese side will participate through the China Branch Company, while the Chinese side will participate in the control organization through a joint association of various cigarette factories. It is reported that this plan may be submitted for review at today's material control review meeting in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Central China Salt Industry Company to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Central China Salt Industry Company was established on January 21st of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). At that time, due to the dispersal of salt farmers everywhere and the near abandonment of salt fields, the company, with its salt transportation organization, temporarily provided loans to salt field merchants and subsidies to salt farmers to enable them to restore their former conditions, engage in production, ensure that the supply of edible salt in the Central China area was not deficient, and export poultry salt to Japan. In addition, it operated the Dapu New Salt Field and refined salt, making considerable contributions to improving salt industry technology in our country. After the transfer of shares from friendly countries to the National Government, the company will be reorganized into a joint state-private-run salt industry company, named the China Salt Industry Company, to continue its past mission and make further progress.</p>

<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks soared dramatically, recovering the declines of the past five days. Some stocks even reached new highs. Wing On Textile strongly advanced. New drugs, the Huang Ye (Yellow Leaf) industry, real estate, and other stocks were also consistently in strong buying ranges. This was mainly due to enthusiastic buyers. With the resumption of trading approaching, investors were thinking of pulling in advance before the market opened, and demand exceeded supply. In the morning, stocks soared across the board. After the high opening in the afternoon, there was a temporary pullback due to a slight easing of sentiment. However, after 3:00 PM, the market regained its footing and rose sharply across the board. Trading was extremely active. The detailed records of each market are listed below:</p>

<p>Rice and Grain: Sources have disappeared. There are minimal scattered transactions. Retail buyers are still operating, and because of the scarcity of arrivals, people's hearts are uneasy. The market situation has risen sharply. New japonica rice has already knocked on the gate. Transactions in miscellaneous grains are rare and the market is flat.</p>

<h3>Starving India</h3>
<p>— Niwa Go</p>
<p>Before arriving in India, I never thought that the people lived such a tragic life. It probably wasn't like this before. How could a country with such excellent philosophy, literature, architecture, science, and religion have reached the point it is now? It is extremely strange. The northern Indian land of Hindustan is vast and the population is large, but the people cannot be said to be well-off. They live in narrow earthen houses, and it is considered good if they have a piece of coarse cloth. The whole family is seven or eight together, living an unnatural life stuck to the mud. On clear days, sand covers everything. On rainy days, the water flows into small rivers, making it impossible to distinguish roads. It doesn't look like a tribal village where people live. There are no electrical facilities, of course. They take horses to warm themselves and light lamps with seed oil.</p>
<p>Farmers are destitute</p>
<p>Because of poverty, methods such as fertilization are never considered. Farming methods are also not studied, and the yield per acre is lower than anywhere else. On this land under the scorching sun, the convenience of water conservancy is never considered. Irrigation is only fifteen or sixteen. The government does not pay attention to these things and only knows how to squeeze them. So why should India be regarded as a treasure trove of Britain and guarded, lest it be lost? That is because weaving, mouth-to-mouth, and rice and hemp are absolutely huge and small. There are 450,000 to 600,000 available for export every year. But every civilian is so poor that these things are never added. As long as it can be increased, that's fine. How did a previously excellent nation reach this point? Simply put, it is the defect of the social structure and the class system. In the monk class, there are Brahmins, in the warrior class, there are Kshatriyas, in the merchant class, there are Vaishyas, and in the slave class, there are Shudras. These four classes are strictly and clearly divided, and the phenomenon of not being aggressive from generation to generation is completely blocked. In terms of religious killing, there is the so-called decay, which refers to the decline of India today. This is also true, but the reason for the killing is greater than this. I would like to assert that it is British imperialism. It is a very terrible organization.</p>
<p>Tax Contracting System This term was only known after coming to India. That is the tax contracting system. That system was started by Clive after winning the famous Battle of Plassey. He defeated the French and the local lords, seized hegemony, and used his power to start this system. Its meaning is to contract the taxes of a certain piece of land to a certain person. The contractor only pays a certain tax and can freely dispose of the land. He can also divide it into small pieces and divide it among others. The rent can be further subdivided to others. Therefore, its price increases layer by layer, and the rent paid by the people is also increased layer by layer in proportion, even through the hands of fifty people. From the point of view of collecting personal taxes, no organizational method is so harsh that it cannot ensure so many sources of wealth. Although this is the powerful property of the East India Company, today it is the source of wealth for Britain. The crops that the farmers work so hard to cultivate cannot be obtained in their own homes and are all stripped away. Although the people of India grow crops, what they grow is not their own. Borrowing money is becoming more and more important. They are born in borrowing, live in borrowing, and pass on the debt to their children and grandchildren until they die. The poorest farmers are in northern India, where the Ganges is most abundant. The reality is crueler than imagined. It is better to say that he is alive than to say that he is on the day before death.</p>
<p>Supply Site for Military Supplies</p>
<p>The empire of England, the people of its land are on the starvation line. Usually, on October 25th, 140, Alexander Jess came to New Delhi to guide the convocation of the Eastern Needs and gathered representatives from the British mainland and other colonial governments to discuss the self-sufficiency of the British territories east of the Suez Canal. It was then decided that wheat should be supplied from India. The Eastern Needs Council was permanently established in New Delhi. India has become a supply base for military supplies. As a result, ships to various colonies are full and sent out in extremely large numbers to Africa, to Asia, and to the army. Therefore, the shortage of materials in India is very serious. Due to the Japanese attack, Burma suddenly became independent. The 500,000 tons of rice that entered from Burma every year was also cut off, and the food shortage was extremely severe. In addition, under the pressure of the Japanese, coastal routes in India were constantly threatened, and land routes were extremely unfree, so objects were biased and the land could not be announced.</p>
<p>The Bengal Uprising</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that the province of Bengal has experienced uprisings due to food shortages. Ninety-three percent of Indians are illiterate and poor. The uprising is probably a bloody struggle before starvation! The average mortality rate in India is 23-24 for men and 24-5 for women. The infant mortality rate is the highest in the world. British gentlemanliness is showing its true face here. No matter how much famine Indians suffer, they are unmoved. Britain is also trying its best to suppress them. They think it can be solved with guns. However, the surging independence movement is sweeping the country. Now is the time for the Indians themselves to wake up. They are seeking the power to advance. That is for the future of mankind. (Xiang: Translated from "Asahi Weekly" October 31st issue)</p>

<h3>The Basis for Solving Personnel Problems</h3>
<p>— Yang Su</p>
<p>In an editorial in the Shen Bao on the 6th of this month, "On Concurrent Warfare," attention was repeatedly paid to personnel issues, and the words were earnest. It can be said that it is a sharp and insightful comment on the current political situation. However, when solving personnel problems, there is a prerequisite that must be considered first.</p>
<p>The most important and most basic issue is naturally the treatment issue. There is no need to dwell on the theory of the issue. What we want to observe is the facts. The current salary schedule for civil servants is based on the standard of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), with a maximum increase of three times. For example, a section chief has a base salary of 3680 yuan, which amounts to about 1150 yuan after the increase, averaging less than 40 yuan per day. Currently, a meal costs at least 20 yuan, which is not enough to cover the cost of one person's meals, let alone other expenses, let alone the support of the family. The position of section chief cannot be considered low. The section members below are even more out of the question. Even those with positions higher than section chief, such as councillors and directors, are in the same boat, worrying about poverty and sighing about hardship.</p>
<p>Because the treatment is not enough to maintain the minimum standard of living, the following phenomena occur among today's civil servants: First is to "go elsewhere when the land is insufficient," which is a natural trend. The Shen Bao editorial bitterly criticizes the abuse of moonlighting, but now civil servants have to do it. Senior officials go to moonlight themselves and also have to find ways to get their subordinates to moonlight. Junior officials also scramble to find ways to moonlight. The more they moonlight, the more ways they have. Therefore, civil servants who hold five positions at the same time are probably not uncommon today. Putting aside the efficiency of the career, it is always the most important thing for the government to do its best to make a few hard-earned money. We should start by improving the treatment. The second is to slip away. Since the income of civil servants is not enough to maintain a living, they naturally cannot be satisfied with their positions and seek to leave every day. When there is an opportunity, they develop externally, forming a phenomenon of civil servants escaping. For example, taking the rice control association mentioned in the Shen Bao editorial, to take the rice control association, some of the association's staff members that I know are indeed old members of the chamber of commerce, but the reason for the change is not a matter of interest, but a matter of treatment. For example, working in the chamber of commerce earns about 600 yuan per month, while an assistant in the rice control association can earn more than 1000 yuan. The treatment of the Rice Control Association cannot be considered high. If the cost of living is a hundred times higher than before the war, it is only equivalent to 20 yuan, but the salary of the chamber of commerce is indeed too low. Since the holders of the Rice Control Association and the Chamber of Commerce are the same people, it is only natural that long-suffering companions be newly missing. This is only an individual case. It is impossible to enumerate the rest who give up B for A and give up public service for other industries. The phenomenon of slipping away has become the way out for civil servants. The third is mediocrity. Those with supernatural powers and methods are either moonlighting or slipping away. Those who come down are mostly mediocre, incompetent, and at the end of their ropes. It is not intentional to despise civil servants, but the actual situation is indeed like this. In fact, society has despised civil servants for more than a day. Carpenters and masons want 70-80 yuan a day, while civil servants only need 30-40 yuan. The fourth is to meet. Because the income from the regular salary is not enough, they can only find ways to make extra money. Those who have experienced it do not think it is wrong, but the bystanders often turn their blessings and officials often become corrupt, and the breakdown of discipline is even more unspeakable. This situation, although not common, is not uncommon. The government has increased the treatment of civil servants several times, and this spring it also announced measures for material salaries. It cannot be said that they are not concerned, but the number of increases has fallen far behind the rise in prices, and the material salaries have finally been blocked a lot. Today, only Nanjing agencies distribute six dou of rough rice to each person at an official price of 450 yuan per stone, which is better than nothing. Today, the government's political difficulties are also real. If we do not sing high-profile, then reducing bureaucratic agencies, eliminating redundant personnel, and realizing administrative simplification to increase the treatment of current civil servants may be the most appropriate method.</p>
<p>The treatment problem is the basis of personnel problems. If a reasonable treatment standard cannot be set, then any strict implementation of integrity and political harmony, the request for administrative efficiency, the recruitment of outstanding talents, and the realization of personnel management will all be out of the question. This point is worth paying attention to and continuing to serve the poor and sick as usual.</p>

<h3>Grove Hospital Renamed: Continues to Serve the Poor and Sick</h3>
<p>Grove Hospital, located at No. 64 Grove Road, District 1 of this city, has expanded its facilities and reorganized its personnel since the Bridge Old People's Medical Fund Committee took over the management. It has various departments and specialized services. Because Grove Road has been renamed Yanqing Road, the hospital will also be renamed Cambridge Hospital from November 1st and will continue to provide services at the original location. The hospital has recently added an economy ward to serve the general salaried class. The Three Religions Moral Society begins winter relief</p>
<p>The climate in this port is getting colder day by day. Moreover, the price of goods is rising endlessly, causing the poor citizens to cry for hunger and cold. The Shanghai Three Religions Moral Charity Council has not stopped killing the poor and helping orphans and widows. It has also decided to start distributing cash today. All poor people who have lost their lives and have orphans can apply to the council with their citizen certificates. In order to expand the distribution in person, so that the relief work can be carried out effectively.</p>
<p>Those who want to send porridge coupons can call 91067 to contact the association. Each porridge coupon costs one yuan and can be used to redeem a bowl of white porridge weighing 12 yuan. Each book of fifty coupons costs five yuan and can be sent to the association's office at No. A, 70 Lane, West End of New World, Ansi Road.</p>
<p>The Poor Need Help. My relative, Qi Shi, is originally from Guangdong and is 67 years old this year. She lost her husband and daughter in middle age. Later, she lost her job and went to Vietnam with his wife. In the beginning, she still sent remittances to Shanghai, but after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the voice was cut off. Zheng Shi became ill from remembering her daughter and was suffering from poverty and illness. After medical treatment, her illness has gradually recovered, but she has lost everything in half a year of illness. She is in a desperate situation and has no relatives to turn to. Moreover, the days are long, and rice is expensive. She often thinks that the environment is like this, and she often has suicidal thoughts. I, Jiang Youxin, have a limited amount of cotton. If I can give a little help, I can save Zheng Shi from the depths of the fire and prolong her life. One day, mother and daughter will be reunited and enjoy the joy of family life. The merit is immeasurable.
