<h3 id="c1">現階段的日本 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>彬龢上月赴日觀光，返滬後會兩述東行觀感，以吿國人。日昨復承聞蘭亭，張雲搏，林康侯，許冠羣，顧南羣，項康元諸公茶會招待，諄囑再述東行所見，乃不辭簡陋。略作報吿，茲並追記，揭載於此，幸讀者垂　。</p>
<p>今天想報吿的，是我到日本後，最重視的兩大問題。一是戰時生產，一是戰時國民動員與國民生活。同時，這兩個問題，也可以歸納爲一個問題，就是增强戰力問題。</p>
<p>先說日本的戰時生產，一言以蔽之，日本巳在動員一切人力物力，爭取時間空間，爲生產的最高效率而努力。</p>
<p>第一，產業超重點主羲，爲日本從事生產的總方針。目前則因南太平洋方面，戰爭日烈，同時，日本當局深感所產飛機斗質的方面縱極優秀，但數量方面更不可忽略，非達到超過敵方數量不可，為爭取時間上的決勝，在短時間內增加產量，更要於年以後的增加。因，日本過所側重的「五大點主航空，船舶鋼鐵，煤，輕金等業，現在改重點主即航空第一主義」。</p>
<p>第二，生一元化問，日本近來頗多更張，積極趨同於一元之途。過去管理生產部門頗多例如材歸商工省，勞務歸厚生省，資金財務大藏省，此管理上的不統一。其次如設計歸企院，施歸陸，海，商工各省，此爲設計與施上的不統以廠區別，則海軍各有管理之工廠，民營工廠則受商統，軍管工廠之產品，民營工廠不能取得結影饗生產，此經營上的不統陸軍海一軍各視需而定，生產因此有過與不及之弊，此爲定貨上的不統一。</p>
<p>日本當局鑒於種種不能統一的現狀，足為生產上之阻力，決定設置軍需省，視事態緩急，製造易，使實施定貨一元化。各種工廠，除海軍有特殊性外，統由軍需省管理或統制，使管理一元化。劃院歸併於軍需省，使設計與實施。此外，並設置運輸通信省，使一港船隻，鐵道等工具，與戰增加生產相配合。</p>
<p>以上是關於日本戰生產的種種動態。</p>
<p>再說日本民動員，以及國生活問題。日本政二日發表，十月份起全國實施「國內態勢強化方案」，中關於國動的，歸納之約如下數點：</p>
<p>大生除理工科外，止延期入伍。</p>
<p>裁减公，對於公務員範圍，再予縮小。</p>
<p>擴大徵用男子勞役，禁止男子就輕易職業。</p>

<h3 id="c2">波根維爾島激戰日機聶炸美陣地　印東部軍事設施亦受空襲 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　南太平洋日軍基地二日電：日海軍機隊曾於十一月十七日，急襲所羅門羣島摩諾島西方海面航行中之敵運輸船團，炸毀其大型運輸船一艘。又是日傍晚猛炸波根爾特羅基納角附近之敵軍陣地，當有一處被炸起火。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二日中央社電　在波根維爾島登陸之美這，雖陸上部隊之熾烈攻擊，但該方面之虞事仍甚軹烈，然美軍之損失已為驚人矣。傳僅在十日間其損害已不下一千人。據合衆社電，美軍自在該島日下午空襲印度東部，聶炸軍事設施。</p>
<p>東京二日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地電：十一月三十日上午八時餘，曾有敵B24型用戶P40型機共三十架，來襲新幾內亞島當附近之日軍陣地，被日軍陸上砲火擊落其B24型三架，日方無損害。</p>
<h3 id="c3">攻吉島損失重大美承認作戰失算　日軍壯烈精神尤使畏懼 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>阿根廷京城二日中央社電　美軍第二海兵師團長史密司少將，頃發表談話，姑婆認美軍於達拉瓦島登陸作虞時失算，其大意謂：美軍於此次作戰中失算，損失異常重大，日軍曾以十五個月之長進間，使達拉瓦島要塞化，並構築堅固之特據點，非以二千磅之炸彈直聶，不能破壞其陣地。達拉瓦島海岸附近百米內，竟發現美海軍屍體百另五具。傳尼關資根據預備報告，發表美軍損害，計陣亡一千九百零二名，負傷二千六百八十名，共計三千七百七十二名。然美軍當局亦承認以上數字僅爲豫備之候定數字，衆料美軍至少陣亡三千或四千。日軍守衛吉爾具特羣島之壯烈精神，似使美軍登陸部隊異常恐慌，美軍指揮官及從軍記者盡力言美軍作戰實況及其所　損害，惟羅斯福長子詹姆士退抵珍珠港後，謂日軍一部隊曾於瑪金島勇敢攻擊美軍，曾見日軍四將校着軍服　證服，價帶動章，率兵數百名，向美軍地　錄。史密斯於其機動部隊達那之報吿中，敘述日軍於敵前　腹之壯烈情形謂，紐之第六十九聯隊、於此次登陸作戰中，曾企圖進攻某地區日軍部隊知衆寡不敵，曾有將校五頸自殺云云。美軍獎於達拉登陸時，損害最大，據前綫捐揮官愛迪生報吿，美水兵二千名至三千名企圖登陸然於日軍猛烈攻擊下登陸成功之生存者，僅數百名，如史密斯所談，日軍僅以十五個之時間，將達拉亞島要塞化，使軍登陸陷於苦戰，故美朝野悉認美軍今後於日軍統治地構築之陣地實行作戰，將愈感困難。例如約新聞報評論謂，徵諸吉爾貝特羣島之登陸作戰，今後美軍縱對及基地加以攻擊。唯有增加死傷，至最後或將不能獲得勝利，此時自美軍而言，仍以使用毒瓦斯為佳。</p>
<h3 id="c4">農業開發公司　菲正籌設中 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>馬尼刺二日中央社電　菲律賓國會開會中，產提出關於業之二法案如次：　設立農業開發公司案，以資本金百萬比率，由菲政府設立菲律賓農業開發公司，其目的在使尙未着手栽培之農業資源，如蓖麻·小麥及麻類　維等，由該公司指民獎勵栽培，並開闢巿塲。　限制民有土地面積　，依菲律賓憲法第八條第三項之規定，國民議會得決定個人公司，公會等所取得保有私有面積之面積，此法案決定土所有面積為個人最多為二百公畝，公司或公會等為一千另二十四公畝，共目的在防止以大資源獨占農業用地，盡量使民保有土地。</p>

<p>南京二日中央社電　自本年一月國府正式與英·美宣戰以來，我正從事於驅逐英·美之方準備·至十月三日，中·日締結同盟條約後，我國更與盟邦日本緊密協力，除努力國內建設外，更以同一步調齊向擊滅英·美之途邁進。最近邦日本於南太平洋一帶發揮無上戰力，收獲莫大戰果後，我國民衆極爲興奮，咸對盟邦強力戰果，本於其建東亞之立塲上，表示無限敬意，此種光榮勝利對完成復興中華，保衛東亞二大使命上，貢獻極大。同時敵方英·美於連戰連敗之劣運，深恐引起國內民衆反感，除積極隱匿敗　外，復於開羅召開英美渝之首腦部會議，討論今後戰爭策略，擴大宣傳，藉口緩和國民反戰氣氛，虛張聲勢，自恃方文明之英·美帝國，其崩潰之期，必在不遠矣。中央社記者自接獲日本大本營發表第四次吉爾具特羣島大戰果後，特往日本南京在勸　軍武官府，訪問海軍武官輔助官小柴中佐、承其發表觀感如下日本自發動大東亞戰爭，獲得共勞圈內豐富資源後，給予敵方失極大。敵為謀奪取　此項失，特其所有之資源，開始總反攻。本於確保澳洲之意，於去年秋季，在所羅方面開始鬥，遂有拉巴爾，波根維爾之役。敵方企圖由所羅門起，經新幾內亞，菲律賓搆成一虛假棧，分割日本於大東亞共榮圈外，再行個別擊破日本與大東亞共榮圈。但因六次波根維爾島海戰之慘敗，其攻勢進攻受阻折，此次意圖克服危運改變制、於是吉爾貝特　戰又起。該處戰役，敵方迄今接連四次犧牲，到處出演之空戰，仍與所羅門方面相同之烈空戰。此種戰　乃爭奪內南洋諸島而作為進攻準備。吉爾貝特海戰為敵方第一拙作，因此本亦曾有萬全準備，我人利用南方南機之天賜　，極易據守，因此敵人亦感覺本身之危險性，幫復改絲易轍，捲土來，因日本保有大東亞共榮圈天賦獨特無二之島嶼，為日本作戰，爲保衛東亞，是為上天賜給東亞民族之天運，實出於敵人料之外。敵具有龐大之遣艦費，數年之建造工程，及千人以上人員結晶之航空母艦，在日本空軍威脅下，一艘一艘沉入海底，藍天有知，對暴處者亦有理所應有之懲罰。美國深恐動搖軍心，遂有開羅會議產生，今日緬甸方面戰況，亦正在我人勝利中不屢進展，凡此種種，皆足確信今後勝利絕對屬於我人。</p>

<p>柏林二日中央社電　據海通社訊：此間軍事專家檢討歐亞二處戰綫敵軍所受之損失情形日，最近二十週來，蘇軍在東綫之集園攻勢，所受損失極為重大，今其戰鬥力已大見削弱。反軸心軍在東西戰塲所受之損失亦極重大，如近二　內美軍在西南太平洋作戰，計損失航空母艦七艘，亦即美在年內所建之航空艦已盡　於此，航空母在遼　之平洋戰塲上作戰頗關重重，今損失七之多，誠可謂爲美國之第次珍珠港事件，　處戰塲迄今並款達到目的，美軍之企圖突破日軍海島根據之鎖鏈亦未如順，且日本尙未以海軍主力出戰，僅以其優秀之空軍與之周旋而已。</p>

<p>柏林二日中央社電　據海通社訉：軍界發言人昨晚稱，德國生力軍現已參加作戰，故東綫各路之蘇軍皆被抑阻，蘇軍戰報中一再述及天氣惡劣之事實，並稱泥濘時期業已開始。此間承認東綫中路之道路情形甚爲惡劣，惟蘇軍所遭最大之困難，不在氣候而在德國生力軍。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二日中央社電　據前綫消息：德軍已於聶伯河中游契爾喀賽區展開大規模反攻，傳德坦克車隊已突被蘇軍防衛綫，將蘇軍一强力部隊殲滅後，並將另一部隊包圍。又據德方消息，德戰鬥機俯衝轟炸機之强力編隊，自二十九日以來，於東綫各主要戰塲開始活躍於契爾喀賽區，並曾猛炸蘇軍兵營砲兵陣地，及機械化部隊等，積極支援陸上部隊作戰。</p>
<p>奧爾厦公路攻防戰劇烈</p>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　德國新聞社訉：星期二日東綫中部重大防禦戰之重心，再度在於斯摩倫斯克之西，蘇軍利用過去九日之平靜，補充其疲態之步兵與坦克師團，並增調援軍與大批重砲隊，此後敵即在斯　倫斯克至奧爾厦之公路兩旁深梯形陣地內，向德軍戰錢發動，早在預料中之攻勢。雙方激戰竟日，甚至天色黑暗仍繼續作戰，但駐於該區之德軍師團始終堅守其最前之陣綫，蘇軍前鋒隊雖不斷獲得來自後方之援軍，但在暫時突破處各據點之蘇軍，在當地得軍立即反攻中均被擊退，黃昏時僅狹隘之回陷處尙在繼續作戰。同時其餘各防禦陣地則均堅守在德軍手中。蘇軍在戈美爾以西與西北所施壓力仍未減，德軍由該區內若干據點撤退而縮短防綫，而未受敵軍之阻。</p>

<p>人—二萬四千人　物—六億二千六百萬元</p>
<p>自從十月二十七日晨，敵部隊登陸擊諾島以來，迄十一月十七日的第五次波根維爾島的空戰止，僅二十日中，日本海軍航空部隊獲得了世界海戰史上空前的由飛機造成的大戰果，粉碎敵的反攻企圖。美國海軍部對此大敗照例旣不皆定，又不否定，掩飾戰局眞相，以欺曚民衆。蓋羅斯福恐除戰爭政策失敗之外，如再承認這敗積，將成爲政府的致命傷。</p>
<p>日本情報局井口情報官在前次會見外籍記老團上，對美當局悄然湮沒美國將士戰死的事實，痛加抨擊。在二十二日的該次會見上，舉出數字，證明敵方所受損失，不僅在物的方面，即在人的方面，美國約喪失兵力二萬四千，這是比一切最痛苦的損失。又被轟炸擊沉的軍艦，其建造費合計達六億三千萬萬元之鉅。敵方之欺瞞的宣傳，經此分析，被粉碎無遣。</p>
<p>先看人的喪失，炸沉者百分之八十，至百分之一百，擊沉者百分之三十，至百分之四十，擊毀的百分之十之船員數，計戰艦及大型航空母艦二千名，重巡洋艦及中型航空母艦九百名，巡洋艦四百名，驅逐艦二百至二百五十名，大型運輸船所裝兵力及船員合計一千名，中型運輸船大百五卞名，小型運輸船四百名。總計起來，最少一萬九千五百名，最多二萬四千四寸五名，這一個鉅數的兵力，業已葬身魚腹。</p>
<p>另一方面，再看物的數字：擊毀者不在內，僅就炸沉擊沉的軍艦而言，戰艦一艘的平均建造費六千萬元（四艘），大型航空母艦三千二百萬元（二艘），中型航空母艦二千萬元（三艘，重巡洋艦一千五百萬元（六艘），巡洋艦一千萬元（九艘），驅逐艦六百萬元（十二艘），艦類不詳一千萬元（一艘），合計六億二千六百萬元的鉅額，沉入南太平洋的海底。（翔：譯自十一月二十五日四部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>土深切注意</p>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　據海通社外交特派員費師爾稱：反軸心國在德黑　舉行之會議，勢將壓迫土耳其改變其中立政策，此乃士耳其負責當局之一致意見。艾登與土外長在開羅之會議，爲蘇聯堅持英國須壓迫土耳其向軸心國宜戰，此爲衆所共知之事。土耳其之巧妙外交手段，係向不願受束縛之途徑推進，並指出土國之交通中心，最容易受空襲，倘土國參戰則交之受破　及其一切後果，均應由英國負責。但英國似不致於迫土國走葡國所走之路，因德國之態度及德國在巴爾幹之兵力，足使英不敢出此，且愛琴海之入口現由德軍控制，故通過韃尼爾海峽之夢想，實無從實現。以上各點之自足，已被此次德黑闌之反軸心國會議所威脅，土當局深　反心國前此壓迫土國參戰之一切企圖既經失敗，此次或將對土國聯合施壓力，故土對此次會議正予最大之注意。</p>
<p>德方之觀察</p>
<p>柏林中央社電　據海通社訉：德國報紙今德國公衆透露，反軸心國企圖對德人民發表在德黑蘭會中草就之宣言。施密特公使昨在情報會議中稱，若細讀英美報紙，即知最近將有類似宣言書之發，德國對德黑蘭會議並不驚異，反之，使吾人極為滿意。德黑蘭會議中將討莫斯科外長會議中未解決之問題，如斯達林堅持第二戰綫之嬰求因渠如無法對德獲得軍事之利，故需要第二戰綫甚迫。惟依德國在義國事件中所獲之敎訓，深悉羅斯福與邱吉爾皆無意於開闢第二戰綫，故德黑蘭會議中充滿種種不洽之暗影。反軸心國對德國人民之宣傳運動，殊無提及之價値，吾人雖不希望敵方繼續實施空　戰術如過去所爲者然，但吾人拒絕接受敵方之恩典。</p>

<h3 id="c36">限制用電 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>近來書局有電力自來火節制辦法之規定，電力消費量，除重要之企業公司外，普遍　　及店戶，减少百分之三十，其原因則為本埠煤斤缺乏。</p>
<p>我們對誰書局因煤斤缺乏而節制電力消耗，在原則上極端的贊同，並且擁　這一辦法的堅決執行。可是，對於事實上的予盾與緩急，當局應在事前充分考慮，務必澈底調整。我們　獻　點意見：</p>
<p>第一，各大公庽旅店等等的熱水汀，完全為養尊處優的享受而用的，在此戰時，這種享受上所　的　斤，大可省　。所以，我們主張因享受而使用水汀者，不但限制用謀，尤應絕對禁止用煤，移水汀煤斤用於生產事業。</p>
<p>第二、生產事業的工廠，以及醫院報館等社會公益事業，祗能估計其最適當用電數量，而予以節制，不應普遍予以减，致影響生產與服務效能。</p>
<p>如果一方面對於生產事業，社會公益事業，為節約煤斤，而减少電力，使之减低生產，减低服務效率。而一方面却任令大公庽，旅館、酒店、娛樂塲，使用熱水汀，消耗煤斤，盡情享受。那末，我們認為這是予盾的不合理現象，盼望當局特別注意之。</p>

<p>最近數週以來，人民日常生活之最感威脅者，莫如一日不可或缺的主要燃料煤球，因此，如何解決本帀煤球恐慌？乃成為上海五百萬巿民，除掉少數囤有大量煤球之富戶，人人所最關切的一個問題。差幸煤球現已計劃實施計口配給，與計口授米，麵粉，糖，油，火柴，肥皂相同了。本來，在生活日用品中。煤球的必需性僅次於米糧，早就應當在實施計口配給之列，雖然以前所規定的標準限價，不能不說是曾經著有安定特價的　效。</p>
<p>前日巿宣傳處所召集之四次記者例會中，大陸新報問：「煤球為日用必需品，然近日不易購置，不知當局對巿民此種痛苦，能設法補救否？」經濟局答：「本巿煤球恐慌，原因在來源缺乏，運輸，曁產煤地產量减少所造成，現在計書實施計口配給，可望於最近將來實行，惟煤球配給每月二萬噸，不足之數亦正與實業部接洽裝運非統制煤，以謀補救。」由於經濟局以上一個答案，我們感覺解決煤球恐慌之重點在於　疏通煤產來源：例如接近華中之蘇淮地區，產煤豐富，其有煙煤灰分甚多，最適於家庭鍋爐之用，且該地區工業並不發達，農民亦不需煤，故產地之消耗甚少，亟宜乘此蘇淮通貨調整期間，圓滑推進其物資——尤其是煤產——之輸出。　增加配給數量：煤球實施計口配給以後，其每人每月之平均數量，必須充分合理化，庶不至於有力者儘管取諸黑巿，而黑巿又復猖獗，無力者終　難乎為繼，而燃料又成問題。以上兩點是我們所願貢獻於統制經濟當局者。</p>

<h3 id="c57">關於水電新限制的意見 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>其一</p>
<p>本市電力消費，自本月一日起，將受新的限制，並嚴訂罰則，超越限度，須受自三倍至二十倍之重罰，越限二次，即停止供鉛。</p>
<p>電力公司方面，爲應付煤斤來源不暢之現象，力謀節約消費，這原是無可非議，並應當一致協力，尤其對於各種者侈消費場所及不正當之消耗，應採取更嚴厲的限制，惟於一般家庭正當需用之電燈，似乎應該顧到大衆視官的健康，就用量大小，取遞增法的限制，不應不問甩電多少，一律予以同一的限率。</p>
<p>按現在電燈用電限制，上海電力公司轄區。减爲供給百分之六十至七十，華中水電公司轄區，減爲供百分之五十五至六十五，法商水電公司轄區，减爲百分之六十五，並且限制用水，祇供給百分之六十。</p>
<p>這個限制，不管是每月消耗數十度或數百度的大富戶，或是每月僅消耗數度小住戶，都是一對待，可是消耗數十百度的大戶，叫他節省用電，打一個六五折。尙無多大困難，但是月用數度的小住戶，平日爲求扣負减少，早已自知節約，再叫他們對無可再節之用電，再打一個六五折或五五折，則勢非極力把十支光十五支光的燈，改成一支光或二支光不可，何况時屆冬令，用燈時間較長。豈非對於視官健康，要予以傷害，至於用水限制，對大富戶亦尙無所謂，而對於早已在自求節省的小住戶，則勢必减少洗瀝，直接影響一般淸潔，即間接影響一般健康。</p>
<p>公用事業根本是為大衆而設，試想整個大上海，究竟還是大富戶人家多呢，還是一般受經濟困難的小住戶多？賢明的當局，必能早經洞察，無待詞費。</p>
<p>所以我有一小建議：主張對於一般住戶用電（水亦然）凡每月用二十度以下的，不予限制。（以單幢三樓房子以準）在二十度以上的。每超過十度，則予以减少百分之幾十，如此則公允易行，而造福大衆不淺。希望市政當局，勿以其事小而忽視之是幸！（白虹）</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>昨見法商水電公司限制水電使用量之通吿一則，現在非常時期，燃料運輸不暢，來源日少，加以限制，事非得巳，凡屬居民，當亦　體當局應急措施之苦心，惟限制之方法甚不平允，蓋向來浪費者，精加减少，並不覺苦，而本來節　至减　可减者，再硬减一如此大折扣，則明明便其受罰或不得使用水電耳。尙有房東包水者．若一里弄有若干家者，何家浪費，何家節省，如何能分別。况近年風氣，房東如何能管制房。</p>
<p>若房束受罰，則恐惟有出於使其停供一途，試問一里弄數十家無水，成何　象，必致糾紛百出耳。</p>
<p>水電二項，爲居民一日不可缺者，限制固當，惟其方法希望市政當局，重加考慮，或以房局間數，或以人口之多專，根據保甲戶口册爲限制使用量之標準，俾使一律平等，且事亦簡單而少紛擾也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan in the Current Phase <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Last month, Binhe traveled to Japan for sightseeing. After returning to Shanghai, he spoke twice about his impressions of the trip eastward to inform the people of our country. Yesterday, he was again invited to a tea party by Messrs. Lan Ting, Zhang Yunbo, Lin Kanghou, Xu Guanqun, Gu Nanqun, and Xiang Kangyuan, who earnestly requested him to further describe what he had seen on his trip eastward. Therefore, he does not decline to give a simple report. The following is a record of his remarks, published here, and hopes that readers will give it their attention.</p>
<p>Today, I want to report on the two major issues that I considered most important after arriving in Japan: wartime production and wartime national mobilization and national life. At the same time, these two issues can also be summarized into one: enhancing war capability.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about Japan's wartime production. In short, Japan is already mobilizing all its manpower and resources, seizing time and space, and striving for the highest efficiency in production.</p>
<p>First, the "super-priority industry doctrine" is Japan's general guiding principle for engaging in production. Currently, due to the escalating war in the South Pacific, and at the same time, Japanese authorities deeply feel that while the quality of domestically produced aircraft is excellent, the quantity cannot be ignored. It is imperative to exceed the enemy's quantity in order to win the decisive battle in terms of time and increase production in a short period, even more so than increasing it in the years to come. Therefore, Japan has changed its previous emphasis on the "five major focus industries" (aviation, shipbuilding, steel, coal, and light metals) to now prioritize "aviation first."</p>
<p>Second, the issue of production unification. Japan has recently undergone many changes, actively moving towards unification. In the past, the management of production departments was fragmented, for example, materials were under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, labor was under the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and funds were under the Ministry of Finance, leading to inconsistencies in management. Secondly, design was under the Planning Board, while implementation was under the various ministries of the Army, Navy, and Commerce and Industry, leading to inconsistencies between design and implementation. In terms of factory distinction, the Navy had its own managed factories, while private factories were under the control of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Products from military-managed factories could not be obtained by private factories, affecting production. This was an inconsistency in management. The Army and Navy each determined production based on their needs, leading to surpluses and deficiencies in production. This was an inconsistency in ordering.</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities, recognizing that the various inconsistencies were obstacles to production, decided to establish the Ministry of Munitions, to expedite or slow down matters, to make manufacturing easier, and to implement unified ordering. All kinds of factories, except for those with special characteristics within the Navy, are to be managed or controlled by the Ministry of Munitions to unify management. The Planning Board is to be merged into the Ministry of Munitions to unify design and implementation. In addition, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications is to be established to coordinate port ships, railways, and other tools with wartime increased production.</p>
<p>The above is about the various dynamics regarding Japan's wartime production.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about Japan's national mobilization and national life. The Japanese government announced on the second day that it would implement the "Domestic Posture Strengthening Plan" nationwide starting in October. The points regarding national mobilization can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>University students, except for those in science and engineering, will no longer be granted deferments from military service.</p>
<p>Reductions in civil servants, further narrowing the scope of civil service.</p>
<p>Expansion of the conscription of men for labor service, prohibiting men from taking up light and easy occupations.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Fierce Battle on Bougainville Island: Japanese Aircraft Bomb Enemy Positions, Military Facilities in Eastern India Also Attacked <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency): A Japanese naval air unit in the South Pacific reported on the 2nd: On November 17th, Japanese naval air units launched a surprise attack on an enemy transport convoy sailing west of Mono Island in the Solomon Islands, destroying a large transport ship. That evening, they heavily bombed enemy positions near Torokina Point on Bougainville Island, setting one area on fire.</p>
<p>Argentina, Jingcheng, 2nd (Central News Agency): The Americans landing on Bougainville Island are under fierce attack by ground forces, and the fighting in that area is very intense. The losses of the American army have been staggering. It is said that in just ten days, their casualties have reached no less than one thousand men. According to a report by the Associated Press, American forces have been raiding eastern India since the afternoon of that island, bombing military facilities.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency): According to a report from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific: On November 30th, at 8:00 AM, enemy B-24 and P-40 aircraft, totaling 30 planes, attacked Japanese positions near Dang in New Guinea. Japanese ground artillery shot down three of the B-24s. The Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Heavy Losses in Attacking Gilberts, U.S. Admits Miscalculation, Awe of Japanese Troops' Heroic Spirit <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Argentina, Jingcheng, 2nd (Central News Agency): Major General Smith, commander of the U.S. 2nd Marine Division, recently gave a speech, frankly admitting that the U.S. military miscalculated when landing on Tarawa Island. The gist of his remarks was: The U.S. military miscalculated in this operation, suffering unusually heavy losses. The Japanese military had spent fifteen months fortifying Tarawa Island and building strongholds that could only be destroyed by direct hits from 2,000-pound bombs. Within 100 meters of the coast of Tarawa Island, 105 corpses of U.S. Navy personnel were found. It is reported that preliminary reports estimate U.S. casualties at 1,902 dead and 2,680 wounded, totaling 3,772. However, U.S. authorities also admit that these figures are only preliminary estimates, and it is expected that the U.S. military lost at least 3,000 or 4,000 dead. The heroic spirit of the Japanese soldiers defending the Gilbert Islands seems to have caused extreme panic among the U.S. landing forces. U.S. commanders and war correspondents have tried their best to describe the real situation of the U.S. military operations and the losses they suffered. However, James Roosevelt, the eldest son of Roosevelt, stated after returning to Pearl Harbor that a Japanese unit had bravely attacked U.S. forces on Makin Island. He saw four Japanese officers wearing military uniforms and badges, leading several hundred soldiers to attack U.S. positions. Smith, in his report to his mobile unit in Dana, described the heroic conduct of the Japanese in the face of the enemy, stating that the 69th Regiment of New Zealand attempted to attack a certain area. Japanese troops, knowing they were outnumbered, had five officers commit suicide. The U.S. military suffered the greatest losses when landing on Tarawa. According to a report by frontline commander Edison, 2,000 to 3,000 U.S. sailors attempted to land, but only several hundred survived the fierce Japanese attack. As Smith said, the Japanese military had fortified Tarawa Island in just fifteen months, causing the U.S. military landing to be a difficult battle. Therefore, U.S. officials and the public alike recognize that it will become increasingly difficult for the U.S. military to carry out operations in areas fortified by the Japanese. For example, the New York News commented that, based on the landing operation in the Gilbert Islands, even if the U.S. military attacks Japanese bases, they will only increase casualties and may ultimately fail to achieve victory. In this case, it would be better for the U.S. military to use poison gas.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Agricultural Development Corporation to be Established in the Philippines <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Manila, 2nd (Central News Agency): During the session of the Philippine Congress, the following two bills regarding agriculture have been presented: The establishment of an Agricultural Development Corporation with a capital of one million pesos. The Philippine government will establish the Philippine Agricultural Development Corporation to encourage the cultivation of agricultural resources that have not yet been cultivated, such as castor beans, wheat, hemp, and ramie, and to develop markets. Restriction of private land area. According to Article VIII, Section 3 of the Philippine Constitution, the National Assembly may determine the area of private land that individuals, companies, and associations can acquire and hold. This bill limits the area of land owned to a maximum of 200 hectares for individuals and 1,024 hectares for companies or associations, with the aim of preventing large-scale monopolies of agricultural land and maximizing land ownership by the people.</p>

The Tokyo headquarters will maintain close contact with the Shonan area and actively launch a powerful new movement. This reorganization was based on the work carried out when Bose visited Tokyo, and it was decided that the Tokyo headquarters would be temporarily located at the Sanno Hotel.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Japan's Attitude Towards Timor Island is Extremely Serious, Embassy in Portugal Clarifies Facts <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon (Central News): Regarding Portuguese Timor, recent rumors from anti-Axis propaganda agencies have been completely clarified by Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar's speech last week and the special statement made by the Japanese Embassy in Lisbon on the 30th. The statement by the Japanese Embassy is as follows: The Japanese troops stationed on Timor Island are doing their best to protect the lives and property of the local Portuguese people and have never infringed upon the slightest freedom of the Portuguese people in farming and fishing. The Japanese authorities provide all possible convenience to the Portuguese people for sending and receiving telegrams and contacting their home country, but naturally cannot allow the sending and receiving of secret coded telegrams in order to maintain confidentiality. On October 5th, the anniversary of Portugal's National Day, the Japanese military commander and consul general visited the governor of Timor Island to offer congratulations. Japan's attitude towards the Timor Island authorities is very serious. The Japanese fleet also protected the Portuguese people who were arrested at the Macau Customs due to pirate disturbances, and sent them back to their families separately. They also released British women.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Lieutenant Commander Koshiba of the Navy Gave a Speech Yesterday, Confident of Ultimate Victory <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency): Since the National Government officially declared war on Britain and the United States in January of this year, we have been preparing to drive out Britain and the United States. After China and Japan concluded a treaty of alliance on October 3rd, our country has been working closely with our ally Japan. In addition to striving for domestic construction, we are also marching in the same step towards defeating Britain and the United States. Recently, our ally Japan has demonstrated unparalleled combat power in the South Pacific and achieved great victories. Our people are extremely excited and express their infinite respect to the strong combat results of our ally, based on their position of building East Asia. This glorious victory has made a great contribution to the completion of the two major missions of revitalizing China and defending East Asia. At the same time, the enemy, Britain and the United States, is deeply afraid that the adverse fortune of successive defeats will arouse resentment among the people at home. In addition to actively concealing their defeats, they also convened a summit conference of the heads of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Cairo to discuss future war strategies and expand propaganda, in an attempt to alleviate the anti-war atmosphere among the people. The British and American empires, who boast of their superior civilization, are bound to collapse in the near future. After the Central News Agency received the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement of the fourth great victory in the Gilbert Islands, it went to the naval attaché's office of the Japanese army in Nanjing and interviewed Lieutenant Commander Koshiba, assistant naval attaché, who made the following remarks: Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, it has gained abundant resources within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, giving the enemy a great loss. In order to seize this loss, the enemy has concentrated all its resources and started a general counterattack. Based on the intention to secure Australia, they started fighting in the Solomons area last fall, resulting in the battles of Rabaul and Bougainville. The enemy attempted to construct a false rampart from the Solomons, through New Guinea, and the Philippines, dividing Japan outside the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and then individually defeating Japan and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, due to the disastrous defeat in the six naval battles of Bougainville Island, their offensive progress was obstructed. This time, they intended to overcome the crisis and change the system, and thus the Gilbert Islands battle began again. In that battle, the enemy has suffered four consecutive sacrifices to date. The air battles that are staged everywhere are still as fierce as the air battles in the Solomons. This kind of war is a struggle for the inner South Sea islands as a preparation for attack. The Gilbert Islands naval battle was the enemy's first clumsy work. Therefore, we have also made full preparations. We utilize the heavenly gift of the southern base, which is very easy to defend. Therefore, the enemy also feels its own danger and is returning with a renewed offensive. Because Japan possesses the unique and unparalleled islands of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, fighting for Japan and defending East Asia is a heavenly fortune bestowed upon the East Asian nations, which is beyond the enemy's expectations. The enemy has a huge fleet expenditure, years of construction projects, and an aircraft carrier that is the culmination of thousands of people's efforts. Under the threat of the Japanese Air Force, they are sinking one by one into the seabed. The blue sky knows, and there is a rightful punishment for those who act violently. The United States is deeply afraid of shaking military morale, and thus the Cairo Conference was created. Today, the situation in Burma is also progressing in our victory. All of this is enough to convince us that future victory absolutely belongs to us.</p>
<h3 id="e10">German Military Experts Review the Overall Situation <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency): According to the Huitong News Agency: Military experts here reviewed the losses suffered by the enemy on the European and Asian fronts, saying that in the past twenty weeks, the Soviet army's concentrated offensive on the Eastern Front has suffered extremely heavy losses, and its combat power has been greatly weakened. The losses suffered by the anti-Axis forces in the Eastern and Western theaters are also extremely heavy. For example, in the recent two weeks, the U.S. military's operations in the Southwest Pacific have resulted in the loss of seven aircraft carriers, meaning that all the aircraft carriers built by the U.S. this year have been lost here. Aircraft carriers are very important in the Pacific theater, and the loss of as many as seven can be said to be America's second Pearl Harbor event. The battlefields have not yet achieved their goals, and the U.S. military's attempt to break through the chain of Japanese island bases has not gone smoothly. Moreover, Japan has not yet deployed its main naval force, but has only used its excellent air force to deal with it.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Fresh German Troops Open Eastern Front, Fierce Battle in Middle Reaches of Dnieper River, Soviet Defense Line at Cherkasy Breached <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency): According to the Huitong News Agency: A military spokesman said last night that fresh German troops have now joined the fighting, so the Soviet forces on all fronts of the Eastern Front have been suppressed. Soviet war reports repeatedly mention the fact that the weather is bad and that the muddy period has begun. It is acknowledged here that the road conditions in the middle of the Eastern Front are very bad, but the greatest difficulty faced by the Soviet army is not the climate, but the fresh German troops.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency): According to frontline news: The German army has launched a large-scale counteroffensive in the Cherkasy area in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River. It is reported that a German tank formation has broken through the Soviet defense line, annihilated a strong Soviet unit, and surrounded another unit. According to German sources, powerful formations of German fighter-bombers have been active on the main battlefields of the Eastern Front since the 29th, and have been actively supporting ground operations by bombing Soviet barracks, artillery positions, and mechanized units.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in the Orsha Highway Offensive and Defensive Battle</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (German News Agency): On Tuesday, the focus of the major defensive battle in the center of the Eastern Front was once again west of Smolensk. The Soviet army took advantage of the calm of the past nine days to replenish its exhausted infantry and tank divisions, and transferred reinforcements and a large number of heavy artillery units. After that, the enemy launched a predictably offensive against the German war front in the deep trapezoidal positions on both sides of the Smolensk-Orsha highway. The fierce battle between the two sides continued all day, even when it was dark, but the German divisions stationed in the area always firmly defended their front lines. Although the Soviet vanguard continued to receive reinforcements from the rear, the Soviet troops who temporarily broke through various strongholds were repelled in the immediate counterattack by the local German troops. At dusk, only narrow depressions were still in combat. At the same time, the remaining defensive positions were all firmly held by the German army. The pressure exerted by the Soviet army west and northwest of Gomel has not diminished. The German army withdrew from some strongholds in the area to shorten the defense line, without being resisted by the enemy army.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: Propaganda Department Formulates Propaganda Plan <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency): Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, two years have passed. Over the past two years, the military victories of our allies have swept away the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia, achieving glorious results. At the same time, in order to establish the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, our allies have spared no effort to assist Myanmar and the Philippines in achieving independence and the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India. Moreover, in view of the evolution of the world situation, China and Japan have signed a treaty of alliance, and the recently announced Greater East Asia Conference Declaration has ushered in a new stage in the East Asian situation. At this critical juncture of the war entering a decisive phase, as we approach the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, in order to strengthen the alliance between the two countries, enhance the awareness of the East Asian nations, promote the enthusiasm for combat, encourage unanimous cooperation to increase production, cooperate in the completion of the war, and promote the realization of comprehensive peace, the Propaganda Department has formulated a propaganda plan and distributed it to local propaganda agencies for implementation. It is learned that the plan stipulates that at 10:00 AM on the 8th, all agencies, organizations, schools, and district offices will hold commemorative ceremonies separately. In order to show the solemn commemoration of the Greater East Asia War, the ceremony includes programs such as silence, paying tribute to the fallen soldiers, praying for the recovery of wounded and sick soldiers, and for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. The above gatherings are based on the principle that each agency holds them separately. If it is deemed necessary to hold joint meetings, a joint commemorative meeting can be held. In addition to the gatherings, each school and youth group can spontaneously hold sports meets or labor services and other activities to stimulate wartime spirit. As for the newspapers, in addition to continuously publishing manuscripts related to the war results of the Greater East Asia War, they will also publish a special issue commemorating the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War to increase production, detailing the relationship between increasing production and cooperating in the war, and various methods of increasing production. From the 8th to the 14th, a week-long campaign will be launched to expand wartime production promotion. Radio stations will invite celebrities to give speeches and hold special lectures on increasing production, inviting experts to give lectures. It has been learned that this propaganda focuses on achieving practical results, avoids empty and ostentatious actions, and cooperates with the overall youth rise movement in order to achieve greater results. (It is also learned) that the Greater East Asia Youth Overall Rise Movement will also begin on the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. According to the regulations of the Central Practice Committee, at 8:00 AM on the 8th, all youth in the country will get up early to implement dawn mobilization, depart for parades, express commemoration of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, and implement the warm spirit of the youth in the overall decisive battle. On the day of the anniversary, people across the country will hold commemorative ceremonies separately. In addition, on the 9th, the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, a joint Sino-Japanese public decisive battle conference commemorating the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War and the National Government's participation in the war will be held at the Dahua Theater. Citizens and youth of the capital of China and Japan must participate, presided over by Mayor Zhou and Consul General Tanaka. After the ceremony, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department and Minister An of the Information Department of the Embassy will give speeches, and there will be Japanese military music performances and screenings of the Greater East Asia War newsreel "Bloody Battle in the South China Sea," military construction of the National Government, and other films. The propaganda slogans for this event are as follows: Commemorate the Greater East Asia War, support the Sino-Japanese alliance; Commemorate the Greater East Asia War, practice the Greater East Asia Declaration; Commemorate the Greater East Asia War, increase production; Commemorate the Greater East Asia War, ensure public order; Commemorate the Greater East Asia War, stabilize people's livelihood; Advance bravely and vigorously, destroy Britain and the United States.</p>

All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their original defense positions.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Enemy Losses Statistics in the Battle of Bougainville Island <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Personnel – 24,000 People, Material – 626 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Since the enemy troops landed on Bougainville Island on the morning of October 27th, up to the fifth aerial battle over Bougainville Island on November 17th, in just twenty days, the Japanese naval air force achieved unprecedented air combat results in the history of naval warfare, thwarting the enemy's counter-offensive attempts. As usual, the United States Navy Department neither confirms nor denies this major defeat, concealing the truth of the battle to deceive the public. Roosevelt fears that in addition to the failure of his war policy, admitting this defeat would be a fatal blow to his government.</p>
<p>At the previous meeting with foreign reporters, Japanese Intelligence Officer Iguchi strongly criticized the US authorities for quietly concealing the fact that American soldiers died in battle. At the meeting on the 22nd, he presented figures proving that the enemy suffered losses not only in terms of materials, but also in terms of personnel. The United States lost about 24,000 troops, which is the most painful loss of all. In addition, the construction cost of the warships bombed and sunk totaled 626 million yuan. The enemy's deceptive propaganda was shattered by this analysis.</p>
<p>Looking first at the loss of personnel, the number of crew members on ships that were sunk was 80% to 100%, on ships that were heavily damaged was 30% to 40%, and on ships that were destroyed was 10%. The estimated number of crew members is 2,000 for battleships and large aircraft carriers, 900 for heavy cruisers and medium aircraft carriers, 400 for cruisers, 200 to 250 for destroyers, 1,000 for large transport ships (including troops and crew), 550 for medium transport ships, and 400 for small transport ships. In total, there were at least 19,500 and at most 24,450 troops, a huge number, who have already been buried at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>On the other hand, let's look at the numbers for materials: not including those destroyed, just the warships that were sunk: the average construction cost of a battleship is 60 million yuan (4 ships), a large aircraft carrier is 32 million yuan (2 ships), a medium aircraft carrier is 20 million yuan (3 ships), a heavy cruiser is 15 million yuan (6 ships), a cruiser is 10 million yuan (9 ships), a destroyer is 6 million yuan (12 ships), and an unidentified ship is 10 million yuan (1 ship). The total is a huge amount of 626 million yuan, which has sunk to the bottom of the South Pacific Ocean. (翔: Translated from the November 25th edition of the Yomiuri Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3 id="e27">Anti-Axis Leaders' Cairo Conference Concludes <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – It is reported that Roosevelt and Churchill arrived in Cairo one after the other on November 20th. Chiang Kai-shek also flew to the area with his wife. The three began holding talks on the 22nd, which lasted for eight days. According to a telegram from Cairo, the Cairo Communique regarding the talks was issued on the 1st. It is reported that the purpose of the talks was primarily to find a way to placate the Chongqing regime. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been steadily progressing. The purpose of this conference was to prevent Chongqing from breaking away from the anti-Axis camp. In particular, the anti-offensive operations in the Pacific are unexpectedly difficult. This conference is a manifestation of the anxiety of the anti-Axis camp. The Cairo Communique also admits that the war against Japan is extremely difficult and will be prolonged. Judging from this point, it can be said that they have recognized the nerve war and that it has no impact on the Japanese people.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a telegram from Washington: The US government stated on the 1st regarding the Cairo Conference: Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek held a meeting in a certain location in North Africa. Participants also included Supreme Allied Commander Southeast Asia, Mountbatten, British Commander-in-Chief of Forces in China, Stilwell, and Air Force Commander Chennault. The US Air Force Commander in India, Meyer, British Chief of Staff Brooke, Army Chief of Staff Cunningham, and Air Force Commander Portal also attended. After the meeting ended, Chiang, Roosevelt, and Churchill traveled together from Cairo to a certain location.</p>
<p>Turkey Paying Close Attention</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Hai Tong News Agency diplomatic correspondent, Fischer: The conference held by the anti-Axis powers in Tehran will pressure Turkey to change its neutral policy. This is the unanimous opinion of Turkish authorities. The meeting between Eden and the Turkish Foreign Minister in Cairo was due to the Soviet Union insisting that Britain must pressure Turkey to declare war on the Axis powers. This is a well-known fact. Turkey's skillful diplomatic tactics are advancing along a path that is unwilling to be bound, and it points out that Turkey's transportation hub is most vulnerable to air raids. If Turkey participates in the war, the damage to transportation and all its consequences should be the responsibility of Britain. However, Britain does not seem likely to force Turkey to follow the path taken by Portugal, because Germany's attitude and Germany's military strength in the Balkans are enough to prevent Britain from doing so. Furthermore, the entrance to the Aegean Sea is currently controlled by German forces, so the dream of passing through the Dardanelles Strait cannot be realized. All of the above points have been threatened by this anti-Axis conference in Tehran. Turkish authorities are deeply concerned that since previous attempts by the anti-Axis powers to pressure Turkey to join the war have failed, this time they may jointly exert pressure on Turkey, so Turkey is paying the utmost attention to this conference.</p>
<p>German Observations</p>
<p>Berlin, (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to the Hai Tong News Agency: The German newspapers today revealed to the German public that the anti-Axis powers intend to issue a declaration drafted at the Tehran Conference to the German people. Minister Schmidt stated at the information conference yesterday that if one reads the British and American newspapers carefully, one will know that a similar declaration will be issued recently. Germany is not surprised by the Tehran Conference; on the contrary, it makes us extremely satisfied. The Tehran Conference will discuss issues not resolved at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, such as Stalin's insistence on the demand for a second front, because he urgently needs a second front since he cannot gain military advantage against Germany. However, based on the lessons Germany has learned from the events in Italy, it is well aware that Roosevelt and Churchill have no intention of opening a second front, so the Tehran Conference is full of shadows of discord. The anti-Axis powers' propaganda campaign against the German people is not worth mentioning. Although we do not hope that the enemy will continue to implement air combat tactics as they have in the past, we refuse to accept the enemy's favors.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Adjusting Purchase Prices to Encourage Cotton Production <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Cotton Control Committee's unified purchase and distribution work is currently being promoted according to the established plan. The points currently under consideration total three: (1) Determining the purchase price of cotton; (2) Raising and utilizing purchase funds; (3) Establishing central warehouses in key cotton-producing areas. According to a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency, the Cotton Control Committee attaches great importance to the adjustment of cotton prices, because past cotton prices were set too low, so farmers have been switching cotton fields to grow miscellaneous grains, resulting in a significant decrease in cotton production. In order to avoid the recurrence of this problem, it has been decided to assess and set purchase prices according to planting costs and with a reasonable profit margin. As for raising purchase funds, in principle, purchasing merchants will handle it themselves. However, the Cotton Control Committee will determine the purchase funds based on actual needs and lend them from the Central Savings Bank.

<p>According to an announcement issued by the First District Public Office: This office, in view of the fact that it is now winter and incidents of poisoning from eating pufferfish are frequent, cautioned fish vendors last month not to sell pufferfish, and urged citizens to pay attention to the danger of eating pufferfish and not to try it lightly, bringing disaster upon themselves. The sale of any kind of pufferfish within the jurisdiction of the First District has long been repeatedly announced as prohibited by the authorities. Those formally approved to sell are not subject to this restriction, but they must incinerate the discarded parts of the pufferfish or send them to the sanitation branch of this office for proper disposal. Do not arbitrarily throw them into the garbage cans, to prevent beggars from eating them and causing danger. Those who deliberately violate this will be severely punished.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Province is implementing the registration of colored wine converted from flower wine and levying taxes on it. The Shanghai District Wine Industry Mutual Aid Association has petitioned the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance to cancel this, because not only are the flower wine licensing procedures quite cumbersome, but also because the raw materials for this colored wine are converted from already-taxed Gaoliang native wine. It should not be re-levied to maintain the difficulties of merchants. The Tax Bureau has approved this, and has ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau to review and decide accordingly.</p>

<p>The work of rechecking household registration in the entire Nanshi district has been completed by the district's Baojia Force Affairs Office. In order to ensure the thoroughness of household registration in its jurisdiction in the future, the office has specially requested the Municipal Baojia Association to organize a clearing team to implement the comprehensive household registration check.

<h3 id="e35">Old Deeds Should Be Exchanged for Practice Certificates at the Land Bureau <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Since this city became a major trading port in our country, land prices have been expensive, and with the flourishing of construction, the terrain has changed greatly, resulting in frequent disputes over land dimensions. Furthermore, this city was surveyed in the third year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty, and land deeds were issued in the fifth year of Xianfeng. These land deeds only stated the number, household name, and mu (unit of area), without maps or boundaries. Therefore, those holding land deeds had no basis. These land deeds are old, and without extremely deep knowledge and old reference books, it is difficult to distinguish the true from the false. Furthermore, there are splits or divisions, with land deeds being cut apart and becoming a corner or a strip, and the acreage being freely filled in, so abuses have arisen. The Land Administration Bureau recognized this change, and since the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, it has been surveying according to the latest methods. For each old section that has been surveyed, it has announced and exchanged land practice certificates since the nineteenth year, collecting miscellaneous documents. These land practice certificates are attached with detailed and accurate maps, so even if the actual boundaries are obliterated, the Land Administration Bureau can measure them accurately according to the map. Currently, many citizens are still using old land deeds for buying and selling, but not only is their property right unstable, but they also have no protection if they are deceived. Because the Land Administration Bureau only transfers and registers rights in the land within the area that has already been announced for certificate exchange based on the land practice certificate. Therefore, buying and selling old deeds is very dangerous. The seller should be quickly ordered to exchange the old land deeds for the land practice certificate from the Land Administration Bureau before the purchase can be accepted. As for the procedures for the exchange, first submit the land deed and matching grain skewers to the Land Administration Bureau, and after the bureau reviews and finds no errors, it will issue a map of the land to the owner, who can check it themselves. If they think it is correct, then sign and seal it and return it to the Land Administration Bureau, which will issue a land practice certificate based on the signed map. This land practice certificate has now become the only reliable property certificate for our Chinese people in this city.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Restrictions on Electricity Use <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Electricity Bureau has stipulated measures for controlling electricity and gas, and the amount of electricity consumed by general enterprises and shops has been reduced by 30%. The reason for this is the shortage of coal in this port.</p>
<p>We are in principle in extreme agreement with and support the resolute implementation of the Shanghai Municipal Electricity Bureau's control of electricity consumption due to the shortage of coal. However, the authorities should fully consider the contradictions and priorities in practice beforehand and make thorough adjustments. We offer a few suggestions:</p>
<p>First, the hot water tanks in major public buildings and hotels are entirely for the enjoyment of the privileged, and the coal used for this kind of enjoyment can be greatly saved during this time of war. Therefore, we advocate that those who use water tanks for enjoyment should not only have their use restricted, but should be absolutely prohibited from using coal, and the coal for water tanks should be shifted to productive enterprises.</p>
<p>Second, the electricity used by factories in productive enterprises, as well as social welfare undertakings such as hospitals and newspapers, should only be restricted by estimating the most appropriate amount of electricity they use, and should not be universally reduced, so as not to affect production and service efficiency.</p>
<p>If, on the one hand, in order to save coal, the electricity for productive enterprises and social welfare undertakings is reduced, causing them to reduce production and reduce service efficiency, but on the other hand, major public buildings, hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues are allowed to use hot water tanks, consume coal, and enjoy themselves to the fullest, then we believe that this is a contradictory and unreasonable phenomenon, and we hope that the authorities will pay special attention to it.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office will soon actively commence its work regarding the unified allocation of flour and bran in this city. According to Shanghai News Agency reporters who inquired with relevant authorities, the fund for the Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office has been temporarily set at 10 million yuan in national currency, to be collected from members of both the Chinese and Japanese sides, with each side contributing 5 million yuan. However, both sides may each first pay half of their share, and jointly pay the remainder when necessary. This fund will accrue interest at an annual rate of less than 1%, paid monthly based on the actual amount paid. All expenses related to the operations and allocation of the Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office will be collected according to the amount approved by the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee. Therefore, all income and expenditure items of the Unified Allocation Office must be budgeted and audited, and submitted to the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee for approval. It is also learned that in addition to seeking to adapt to the special allocation environment of flour and bran and widely establishing flour and bran retail allocation points, the Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office will, if necessary, set up branch offices in various locations within this district.</p>
<p>Tea and Food Guild Handles Flour Collection</p>
<p>Since receiving a letter from the Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office to handle the unified allocation of raw rice for food, the Shanghai Special Municipality Tea and Food Industry Guild has created a roster of members and the quantity of flour required, and submitted it to the office for unified allocation. After passing the examination, a special flour purchase certificate will be issued and then forwarded to its members who are tea and pastry businesses, allowing them to collect flour from designated retail allocation points upon presentation of the certificate. The back of the flour collection certificate is stamped with the guild's seal. It is also heard that the flour obtained by each business is only allowed to be used for manufacturing food in its business operations, and absolutely not be resold for profit. Violators will have their allocation suspended and be subject to punishment. In addition, all members are notified that those who join various guilds and mix and collect flour under the same address, same brand, and same business for the purpose of applying for flour allocation will be severely punished.</p>

<p>Central News Agency report: Although the coal briquette panic in this city has been repeatedly publicized and attempts have been made by the authorities to remedy it, it has not yet been implemented, and the coal briquette black market is rampant, causing great suffering to the citizens and almost leading to a cooking fuel shortage. It is now learned that the Central Market has been approved by the authorities to resolve the fuel problem for the citizens, and the Central Market Miscellaneous Firewood and Charcoal Group will implement a comprehensive purchase of miscellaneous firewood and dredge sources to distribute it to the citizens at fair prices. It is also learned that the market is working jointly with the First District Economic Office to suppress vegetable prices. In addition to the previous registration of vegetable vendors to join the association, wooden signs are now being made to mark the price limits and set up in each vegetable market, ordering compliance. Personnel from the First District Economic Office are also monitoring to ensure that vegetable prices are effectively suppressed.</p>

<p>Cai Rixin, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Procuratorate, in order to effectively rectify law and discipline and strictly prohibit swindling under the name of the procuratorate's staff, yesterday issued a special notice, stating: "Criminal defendants often, after the case occurs, either ask someone for help or try to bribe, vainly hoping to avoid criminal punishment and remain at large. It must be known that intercession is forbidden in thousands of cases, and there are constant punishments for monetary maneuvers. Not only is it a waste of money, but it also leads to the legal net. Litigants should rely on the law for defense. Criminal summons, service, and bail are never charged fees. Buying written complaints and paying fines all require formal receipts to be issued, and no extra money should be collected. This should also be noted, and do not be fooled by others. If unscrupulous people engage in swindling under the name of the procuratorate's staff, or laborers demand money outside, formal accusations and reports can be made, and if investigations confirm the facts, severe punishment will be given without leniency."</p>

<h3 id="e45">Commentary: The Coal Briquette Allocation Problem <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>In recent weeks, the most threatening aspect of people's daily lives has been the essential fuel coal briquettes, which are indispensable every day. Therefore, how to solve the coal briquette panic in this city has become the most concerning issue for the five million citizens of Shanghai, except for a few wealthy households who have hoarded large amounts of coal briquettes. Fortunately, coal briquettes are now planned to be allocated based on population, similar to rice, flour, sugar, oil, matches, and soap. Originally, among daily necessities, the necessity of coal briquettes is second only to rice and grain, and it should have been included in the list of population-based allocation a long time ago. Although the standard price limit previously stipulated cannot be said to have had a stabilizing effect on special prices.</p>
<p>At the fourth press conference convened by the City Propaganda Office the other day, the Continental News asked: "Coal briquettes are daily necessities, but they are difficult to purchase recently. I wonder if the authorities can find a way to remedy this suffering of the citizens?" The Economic Bureau replied: "The reason for the coal briquette panic in this city is due to the lack of supply, transportation, and reduced production in coal-producing areas. Now, the plan to implement population-based allocation is expected to be implemented in the near future. However, the monthly allocation of coal briquettes is 20,000 tons, and the shortage is also being discussed with the Ministry of Industry to transport non-controlled coal to remedy the situation." Based on the above answer from the Economic Bureau, we feel that the focus of solving the coal briquette panic lies in dredging the source of coal production: For example, the Su-Huai area near Central China is rich in coal production. Its bituminous coal has a lot of ash content, which is most suitable for household boilers. Moreover, the industry in the area is not developed, and farmers do not need coal. Therefore, the consumption of production areas is very small. It is urgent to take advantage of the currency adjustment period in Su-Huai to smoothly promote the export of its materials—especially coal production. Increase the amount of allocation: After the implementation of population-based allocation of coal briquettes, the average amount per person per month must be fully rationalized, so that those with strength can still take from the black market, and the black market will become rampant again, and those without strength will eventually find it difficult to continue, and fuel will become a problem again. The above two points are what we would like to contribute to the authorities in charge of the controlled economy.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Industry Appraisal Committees Review Price Limits <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The appraisal committees for goods under various industry guilds in this city have recently held separate meetings to review whether the standard price limits assessed in the past are suitable and to examine the purchase cost reports and general business conditions repeatedly submitted by industry members.</p>
<p>It is understood that some guilds are still strictly enforcing the price limits set in the past, but a few guilds are adapting to the current situation and making appropriate changes to the price limits assessed in the past.</p>
<p>These changes are listed in a table and sent to the competent authorities for approval. After the authorities approve them, they are printed and distributed to all members of the industry for compliance and sale at the limited prices. Once member merchants receive this price list, they must post it in a prominent place for people to refer to. Anyone who purchases the items listed on the table must not engage in any transgressions, otherwise anyone can file a written complaint with the industry guild or relevant authorities for investigation. If the facts are confirmed, strict penalties will be imposed to serve as a warning to others. Yesterday, it was learned that the city's enamelware industry guild has assessed price limits for various</p>
<p>Enamelware</p>
<p>and has submitted them to the Economic Office of the First District Public Office for approval. Price lists have now been printed. Notices have been issued that they can be obtained from 228 Avenue Joffre from today, but a letter with a seal must be provided, and each industry trading company is limited to one copy.</p>

<p>Tea has long been included by the government authorities in the scope of major commodities, but at present, tea sales have not yet been controlled. This is because the tea control organization under the National General Association of Commerce has not yet been organized. According to reporters from relevant parties, regarding the control of tea, the Chinese and Japanese sides will each form a tea industry association and then cooperate to carry out unified procurement and allocation work. At present, the Japanese tea industry association has been organized. The Chinese tea industry guild association will be prepared and organized by the Shanghai Tea Industry Guild as the center, uniting local industry guilds.</p>

<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday, the market was relatively firm. Although there were a large number of short sellers in the market, there were occasional hedges, so the market price did not easily fall. Yesterday, Category C opened and rose immediately, then eased back, and finally was slightly better than before. The four types A, B, D, and E were all good, and the trend may continue to rise.</p>
<p>Grains: Yesterday, the market was still difficult to improve. Because of the sales of rice per household, the actual sales were increasingly inferior, and the market situation was ultimately weak. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice fell again. Although the owners of oil and grain goods hoped to raise prices due to the rise in production prices, buyers were still rare, and it was still difficult to rise.</p>

<p>It has been found that in this city, except for the special district and the prosperous areas of the old Shanghai County, the land certificates of each area have been announced and exchanged before the incident (the drawings of each map can be seen at the display offices of this bureau and the Central District Office). To date, many people have come to exchange them, but there are still quite a few who have not exchanged them. Now, it is reported that there are still cases of using old deeds for trade and mortgage. It must be known that the old land deeds have no topography and many deeds do not match the land, which can easily lead to disputes. Therefore, this bureau handles the registration of transfer, mortgage, land easement, and other rights in the exchanged map shares based on the land certificate. It is further announced for general knowledge that all old single lands in the publicly announced maps that have not been exchanged for certificates should be quickly exchanged by the owners with various property certificates to the Central District Office of this bureau at 66 Zhapu Road for land exchange registration to obtain a certificate to solidify property rights. Those who still engage in old single trade, mortgage, and other acts will not be protected by this bureau. Please do not delay and mislead yourself. Please be aware of this announcement.

<p>In accordance with the Executive Yuan's Instructions No. 3176: "The case is based on the Ministry of Industry's presentation of November 22nd, 32nd year regarding the case of investigating and dealing with the movement of materials within the regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and Nanjing and Shanghai special cities, which has been announced in the Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Wartime Material Movement formulated by the National Government. In accordance with the provisions of the said regulations, except for the materials specified in Article 5, which may not be moved without the permission of the legal authority, and the materials specified in Article 6, the movement of materials into and out of the Shanghai region shall require the permission of the National General Association of Commercial Control. Apart from the special regulations, the movement of materials within the three provinces and two cities other than Shanghai shall not be restricted. The regulations then stipulate that materials other than those in Articles 5 and 6 may not be restricted within the three provinces and two cities unless there are special regulations (such as goods similar to bullion or silver products). The above regulations imply the promotion of smooth flow of goods while controlling them, and the intention is excellent. However, in recent years, the suppression of the movement of materials by local provinces and cities has been too restrictive, failing to fully comply with the original intention of the legislation. In addition to further liaison with the relevant authorities by this Ministry, the provincial and municipal governments are requested to strictly follow the above regulations to ensure that materials whose movement is not restricted by laws and regulations can circulate as freely as possible to secure people's livelihoods and comply with the intention of the law. Is this appropriate? The case is hereby submitted to the Executive Yuan for examination and implementation. It is appropriate," etc. Therefore, in addition to ordering subordinates to comply, this announcement is urgently issued for public knowledge. Mayor Chen Gongbo, December, 1943</p>

<p>Promote female labor and ensure full employment for women.</p>
<p>Abolish the retirement system; the elderly should not retire either.</p>
<p>Government offices should abolish the half-day work system on Saturdays, and sometimes even work on Sundays. Production should implement a 24-hour non-stop system.</p>
<p>The allocation and utilization of labor should be further considered to ensure it is appropriate. One point that deserves our attention is that while Japan is making every effort to requisition national labor, it is also strengthening the rationing system to provide greater security and stability to the lives of ordinary people.</p>
<p>From this, we can glean a general understanding of the stability of Japanese people's lives from Japanese price trends and salary income.</p>
<p>(A) Salaries of Business and Industrial Employees</p>
<p>Entry-level employees: Monthly salary of 55 to 80 yuan, with an annual increase of 3 to 8 yuan. (After 2-3 years, they can be promoted to section chief)</p>
<p>Section Chief (Entry Level) Income: Monthly salary of 160 yuan</p>
<p>A medium-level writer receives 3 to 5 yuan per manuscript page, creating about 2 articles per month, totaling 60 pages, with an income of 180 to 300 yuan. Royalties for a single-volume book are 15%, with a novel selling for 2 yuan per copy, and 5,000 copies printed, resulting in royalty income of 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Overall, the above figures show that whether in business, industry, or culture, personal life is generally prosperous. Moreover, a significant proportion of personal expenditure is allocated to government bonds and savings, which further illustrates the effectiveness of the government's savings policies and the inevitable stability of the currency.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Opinions on the New Restrictions on Water and Electricity <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>One</p>
<p>From the first day of this month, electricity consumption in the city will be subject to new restrictions, with strict penalties. Exceeding the limit will result in heavy penalties ranging from three to twenty times the original rate. Exceeding the limit twice will result in the suspension of supply.</p>
<p>The power company is striving to conserve consumption in response to the irregular supply of coal, which is undoubtedly justifiable and should be jointly supported. In particular, stricter restrictions should be imposed on various extravagant consumption venues and improper consumption. However, regarding the legitimate use of electricity for lighting in general households, consideration should be given to the health of the public's eyesight. A progressive approach should be taken, with restrictions based on the amount of consumption, rather than applying the same restriction rate regardless of how much electricity is used.</p>
<p>Currently, electricity consumption restrictions are as follows: Shanghai Power Company's service area is reduced to 60% to 70% of supply, China Central Water and Electricity Company's service area is reduced to 55% to 65%, and the French Water and Electricity Company's service area is reduced to 65%. Water consumption is also restricted, with only 60% supply.</p>
<p>This restriction treats large wealthy households that consume dozens or hundreds of kilowatt-hours per month the same way as small households that consume only a few kilowatt-hours. It is not too difficult for large households that consume hundreds of kilowatt-hours to save electricity by reducing their consumption by 35%. However, for small households that use only a few kilowatt-hours per month, who are already consciously conserving to reduce expenses, asking them to further reduce their already minimal electricity consumption by 35% or 45% would inevitably force them to replace ten or fifteen-watt bulbs with one or two-watt bulbs. Moreover, as winter approaches, lighting hours are longer. Wouldn't this be harmful to eyesight? As for water restrictions, they are not a problem for large wealthy households, but for small households that are already trying to save water, it will inevitably lead to reduced washing, directly affecting general cleanliness, and indirectly affecting general health.</p>
<p>Public utilities are fundamentally established for the public good. Consider whether there are more wealthy households or economically struggling small households in Shanghai. The wise authorities must already be aware of this and do not need to be told.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have a small suggestion: I advocate that households consuming less than 20 kilowatt-hours of electricity (or water) per month should not be restricted. (Based on a three-story house) For those consuming more than 20 kilowatt-hours, a reduction of several tens of percent should be imposed for every ten kilowatt-hours exceeded. This would be fair and easy to implement, and would greatly benefit the public. I hope the municipal authorities will not neglect this matter just because it seems trivial! (Bai Hong)</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw a notice from the French Water and Electricity Company restricting the use of water and electricity. In these extraordinary times, fuel transport is disrupted, and supplies are dwindling daily. Restrictions are inevitable. All residents should understand the hardship of the authorities' emergency measures. However, the method of restriction is very unfair. Those who have always been wasteful do not feel much hardship from careful reduction, while those who have already economized to the point of being unable to economize further are being forced to reduce consumption by such a large discount, which clearly leads them to be fined or unable to use water and electricity. There are also landlords who include water in the rent. If there are several households in an alley, how can one distinguish which household is wasteful and which is economical? Moreover, in recent years, how can landlords control their tenants?</p>
<p>If landlords are fined, they may resort to cutting off the supply. Imagine dozens of households in an alley without water, what a scene it would be, inevitably leading to numerous disputes.</p>
<p>Water and electricity are indispensable for residents. Restrictions are appropriate, but I hope the municipal authorities will reconsider the method, or base the restriction on the number of rooms in a house, or on the number of people, according to the household registration books, so that it is uniformly equal, simple, and less disruptive.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Rocks Found in Rice Sold in Dumi Ne, Each "Dou" Lacking As Much As Four or Five Jin <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Recently, some unscrupulous individuals have formed gangs to sell rice in Xujiahui. They use skillful means and false scales to deceive those who do not bring their own scales. Because there are many accomplices, it is difficult to detect. Each "dou" of rice (weighing sixteen jin) is short by as much as four or five jin. They also sometimes switch bags of rice. They also mix stones into the rice. Various fraudulent tactics easily deceive people. Even when bystanders notice, they dare not speak out, fearing retaliation from the gang. The other day, I went to buy two "dou" of rice and borrowed someone else's scale. Unexpectedly, the nearby rice sellers were all accomplices. When weighing the rice, the weight seemed sufficient, but after returning home, I discovered that the two "dou" of rice were short by ten jin, and there were two stones in the rice. Many people have suffered from this. I advise those who buy rice in that area in the future to bring their own scales to avoid being victimized. (Xia Bingheng)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Various Educational and Welfare Organizations Face Difficulties <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>According to the China Child Welfare Association, there are 39 educational and welfare organizations in the city, accommodating a total of over 5,000 children. Recently, due to rising prices, expenses have increased several times, while donations have decreased sharply compared to before, making it difficult to maintain operations. The most difficult issue is the food problem. Although the authorities allocate rice monthly, it is far from sufficient, so coarse grains such as wheat, sweet potatoes, and red beans are used to supplement the supply. We deeply hope that the authorities will provide timely assistance and allocate special rations of rice to help them maintain operations. According to current prices, each child requires at least 300 yuan per month for food expenses. The association is currently conducting a survey of the feeding conditions of various educational and welfare organizations.</p>
