<p>社評</p>
<h3>論人才與用人</h3>
<p>司馬光曾經說過：「爲政之道，莫若得人，百官稱職，萬務咸治」。所謂得人，當然指人　而言。得了人才，同時還須善於仟用，才職相稱，始能「萬務咸　」。司馬光這段話的中心，是說人才與用人佔着相等重要的地位。衡　目前，時代雖有今昔之別，政治雖有環境之異，而這段話的眞理，却完全適用而顛撲不破。</p>
<p>人才原是相對的，而非絕對的。必須經過比較，然後方顯出才能的程度；必須仟用適當，然後可以發揮其效率。舉例言之，甲乙二人担仟同樣職務，考核成績，甲優於乙，這是經過比而顯出才能的高低。又如甲是學法律的，去做會計的事；乙是學會計的，去做律師的幫辦，結果縱不　事，必無效率。學非所用用非所習，在個人則寒窗苦鑚，白費功夫。在國家則十年敎訓，無一成器。互相埋怨，互相責備。</p>
<p>我國自晚淸以來，政治迄未走卜軌道，行政機關積弊重重，其原因雖非一端，但人事上的不健全，無疑是一個最大的關鍵。淸未與民初之際，行政人員類多腐化官僚，氣習甚深，能力薄弱，以致把政治弄成黑漆一團的局面。論者都歸咎於新敎育未能普遍的推行，從政人目未經學校敎育的訓練，才有如此現象。時至今日，新敎育的推行，已可說相當的悠久，而從政人員的大多數，又均從學校敎育訓練出來，然而政治的修明，距我們的期望尙遠，行政機關的積習，迄未澄淸。其最主要的原因，就是由於敎育的功能，只限於學校範圍以內，受過學校訓練的分子，一出校門，投身社會，即已完全忘却在學校時代的精神，而與氣習深重的環境同化。馴至漸變本來面目；甘與往日的腐化官僚同流合汚，這不僅是影響到行政效率的低微，更使政治德日趨墮落。</p>
<p>因此，人才問題在今日，格外顯得重要。目前的事實，行政機關，感覺人才缺乏，人才恐慌，我們試加分析其恐慌的原因；第一，還是政治未上軌道，具有專門性質的政爭，需要專門學識的人才辦理的，却充塞着庸碌之流。縱有少數專門人才，却被擯門外，末由登用。第二，政治上旣不重視專門人才，一般後進靑年乃避重就輕，於是學習文科法科的特別充溢，研究專門技術的漸漸减少。文科法科人才，當然也有其需要，但任用於專門職務，自然不能稱職。第三，政府對於從事專門硏究的學術機關旣少設立，民間硏究團體又少獎勵扶助，對於專門人才之培養，影響極大。凡此三點，都爲今日人才恐慌的主要原因。</p>
<p>至於用人之道，如能「知人善用」，也可以消極的補救人才恐慌。所謂「知人」，是在用人之先，必須詳細考察共長處與短處，用其所長，容其所短，務使才稱其職，方能盡量發揮其才能。這話雖極淺顯，而事實上眞能做到的，却不多見。目前一般情形，不無「有事無人做」，或「事事有人做，件件辦不好」的現象。小才大用，旣足貽誤事機：或者職務太多，責任不專，浪費人才。所以「知人」之後，必須將一定的人才，支配在一定的位置，專共職責，一其事權，我們相信對於政治效率，必可提高。</p>
<p>所謂「善用」，就是絕對信任，絕對愛護。考察其的確是人才，便須特別珍惜，付以全權，切不可疑忌牽掣，致使不安於位；也不宜時常更換，致使心存五日京兆，只圖敷衍於一時，而不能安心於勵精圖治。</p>
<p>我們如再分析用人標準與政治效率，則適成正比例，如果用人標準趨向私的觀念，則政治效率必然低微。蓋如　用人不問才具，而惟私惟親。　用人抱具同鄕觀念，地域觀念。　物以類聚，因私利而互相結合。重慶政權的蔣宋孔三位一體，用人標準，非親戚，即同鄉。如因親戚同鄉關係而識得顯要，則其人縱是飯囊酒袋，也成萬能通才，無事不可做，而結果必然無事辦得好。尤爲可哂者，乃政府官員之妻妾干政，形成專制時代之專寵擅權現象，如宋美齡宋靄齡之於重慶政權。政治末落，此爲最大原因。</p>
<p>欲求政治走上軌道，達到修明之境，對於用人絕對需要「唯才主義。」眞有才具能稱職位者，私人可用，即抆對我者，亦可引用，純爲辦事效率着想，應有此種態度與容量。所以，我們主張，處理人才與用人問題，必須採取公開考試與嚴格銓叙制度，無所謂私人情感的愛惡，只依才能的質量爲標準，有才幹者委任適稱的重任。尸位素餐者就須罷黜。登庸之選，卽以才能爲衡量的標準，則备緣臘等的流弊，可以改善。而使抱具才幹之士，不致抑　於野而克展所長。</p>
<p>我們提出用人唯才主義，以爲匡正政府機關人事的偏弊，更爲政治踏上軌道的階梯。</p>

<h3>日陸海空軍呼應新幾內亞島激戰　霍巴附近敵方艦艇受重創</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日大本營六日午十二時發表：九月二日有敵機約四十架，來襲新幾內亞島之威瓦克港，攻擊停於該港內之我運輸船，我戰鬥機隊及地上砲火即對之加以攻擊，當擊落敵機十九架，我方運輸船一艘沉沒。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日大本營六日下午四時卅分發表：　九月四日晨，敵軍以強力運輸船團，在新幾內亞島拉埃東方卅五公里處之霍巴附近開始登陸。　日陸海軍當即出動，於緊密協力之下，在敵軍登陸地點附近及海上攻擊敵軍中，迄現在爲止，查明戰果如次：擊沉敵運輸艦六艘，巡洋艦一艘及舟艇多艘，另有敵運輸船五艘及驅逐艦兩艘中彈起火受創，並擊落戰鬥機廿七架。日方損害有炸及未歸還飛機九架。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　新幾內亞方面日軍，現在於　拉摩亞附近與敵軍激戰，敵方受害極大，同時日空軍亦與陸上部隊相呼應，強襲敵空軍根據地，澈底摧毀敵空軍勢力，保確制空權，日軍陸上防空部隊亦對來襲之敵機施以準確射擊，活躍甚力。根據日大本營之發表，日機及防空部隊，二日邀擊來襲新幾內亞島威瓦克之敵機約四十架，當擊落其十九架，蓋九月二日八時半，敵機約四十架來襲日軍基地威瓦克，攻擊停泊於該港之日運輸船，但因人員及軍需品均已登陸卸運完畢，故除炸沉運輸船一艘外，別無損失。反之，敵機則被日戰鬥機擊落（P38）型機六架，（B15）型機八架。合計十四架，地上砲火亦擊落其（P38）型機二架，（B25）型機三架，計五架，總計十九架，其餘倉皇退去。</p>
<h3>所羅門島方面日機隊戰果　波根維爾有激烈空戰</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日海軍水上飛機隊，三日夜半在哥倫班喀拉島南岸發見敵魚雷艇四艘，當加以熾烈襲擊，將其二艘擊毀，又日水上機曾於三四兩日之未明，二次襲擊佐治亞島之拜洛亞，因係夜間，故所獲戰果不明。又日海軍機隊三日傍晚會轟炸孟逢方面之敵軍陣地，戰果亦不明。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　西南太平洋方面美空軍，四日晨以陶格拉斯型轟炸機及巨人式　特西科爾　基型等戰鬥機，合計六十六架之大編隊來襲哥倫班喀拉島日軍陣地，日軍陸上部隊即以猛烈之砲火應戰，當擊落美機七架，餘皆　去，而日方損害輕微。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　南太平洋日軍某基地電，三日上午美軍以大型轟炸機二十九架，巨人式渥特西科斯基型等戰鬥機三十架，合計五十九架，聯合大編隊來襲波根維爾島東南方而軍陣地，日戰機隊當在該島上空迎擊，經數十分鐘之壯烈空戰，當擊毀其大型轟炸機二架，擊毀巨人式戰鬥機二架，餘皆遁去，日方損害輕微。</p>
<h3>渝方承認日機空襲</h3>
<p>廣州六日中央社電　陸軍航軍空部隊連日來對駐渝美空軍基地加以猛攻，渝方電合廣播亦承認福建省之建甌及廣西省之梧州兩機協，於三四兩日受日機空襲，曾　相當損害，並稱其他各地，亦有日機來襲。</p>
<h3>泰軍事考察團訪日陸海軍省</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　泰國軍事考察團團長培齊德中將，六日偕同代表五名往訪日陸軍省及海軍省，並各贈金一封。</p>
<h3>實業部主管主要商品品目行政院會議修正</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　政府前於行政院會議時，曾決定修正實業部主管主要商品品目，茲據行政院發表其所修正者如左：　棉花，　棉紗，　棉製品，（包括布疋及針織品）　化學工業品，（包括原料西華顏料染料及酒精）　毛織維及其製品，　繭，　　及絲製品，　工業油脂，　蠟燭，　肥皂，　　火柴，　　塊煤及煤球。　　捲烟及姻葉，　　橡膠，（包括原料及製品）　　五金，（包括鐵，鋼，白鐵，及非鐵金屬之原料及製品，　　玻璃，（包括原料及製品）　　電氣器具，（包括原料及製品）　　皮革，（包括原料及製品）　。藏及　製品。</p>
<h3>日靑木大臣訪東條首相　報告赴中滿考察經過</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日靑木大東亞相，六日下午三時半訪問東條首相，報告訪問中，滿經過，幷進行種種要談。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日靑太大東亞相六日下千五時半，在大東亞省接見記者團，就訪問中滿兩國經過發表談話，大意如次：余於八月十九日自東京啓程，歷訪華中華北　疆及滿洲等地，於五日始返東京。</p>
<p>中日提携愈加緊密</p>
<p>當余訪問中華民國時，曾與注全席國府各要人開誠懇談，總之，中日關係已因日本本年初實施對中國新政策及中國對英美宣戰而踏入新局面。其提携之緊密，已愈益加深，汪主席曁國府要人均能理解日本之眞意，且其以利的勇往精神貫徹戰爭，建設大東亞共榮　之決意，益形堅決。並爲謀加强整備戰時態勢，伸張行政力，維持治安，提高國民精神，增强生產起見，刻正作最大之努力。又中國國民中之智識份子理解日本新政策之主旨者，已逐漸增多，蓋日本新政策全旨如撒廢治外法權，交還租界等，均在援助中國完成自主獨立，且尊重中國之獨立，在此等知識份子中，其積極協力日本收拾時局，以謀中國復興之意義正日益滋長。至於渝方今猶依賴英美援助，惟以游擊戰，宣傳戰爲能事，雖妄冀反軸心方面在世界戰爭中獲得最後勝利，但最近渝方戰力更大爲低下，經濟困難已無可掩飾。試就世界戰局之影響及目下　雜之經濟情形而觀，則根本解決中日問題，今後尙須努力，但余相信賢明之中國人士，無不處及東亞將來之趨勢，亦無不理解日本之誠意，余此次訪問中國之後，確信日本根據既定方針，推進各項施策，同時因中國之自覺，必能使中日兩國關係恢復本然姿態。</p>
<p>歷訪各地農產豐收</p>
<p>其次余訪問滿洲國時，是該國政治經濟交通等各部門，均有驚異之進展，尤以製鐵業與其他重工業之發達最爲顯明。該國現爲貫澈大東亞戰爭，與日本作絕大協力，其中如共給鐵糧食等重要資源，貢獻極多，此爲余所目睹之現狀，余此次歷訪華中華北　疆滿洲各地，其農產物之豐收，均在預期以上深威天佑。余前曾巡視南方，今又訪問中滿兩國，視察大東亞各民族與日本協力，貫澈大東亞之現狀，則必勝之信念，於此已益形强固。</p>
<h3>全國政工會議定期在京舉行　謀強化軍隊政治訓練</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　軍委會定於本月九日召開全國政工會議，其目的：　自軍事機構改組以來，於今已八月，此次政工會議中，在檢討過去陸海空軍政治訓練工作，並計劃未來的劃一進行，以强化軍隊政治訓練。　自國府參戰以來，爲使軍隊深切明瞭中國之獨立生存，必須於大東亞戰爭之勝利中獲得，由此綜合才能發揮軍事力量，故政訓工作尤爲重要，是以此次會議討論之中心，一·爲陸海空軍實行新國民運動，奉行軍人信條，發動軍隊精神總動員力量，以期努力完遂大東亞戰爭之目的，二·爲國府參戰後政訓人員應有之認識與今後工作之策進。此次出席參加會議者共有五十餘單位，係各方面軍各集團軍各師國政訓處長各軍事學校軍事機構政訓主任，及各省市保安處第三科科長，首都出席人員曁漢口出席人員業已報到，華北及廣東方面之出席人員亦將於今明兩日趕到，屆時該會並邀請各軍訓有關機關派員列席會議，以謀政治訓練與軍事訓練之密切聯絡，連日來已收提案九十件，預料對於今後政訓工作，定有一番新貢獻。又悉，全國政工會議會塲，假國府大禮堂，會期自九日至十一日共三日，大會秘書廳秘書長由軍事委員會政訓司周司長擔任，下分議事，招待，文書，事務四組，由軍委會政治訓練總務司科長分任，現以開會日期在即，秘書廳已於八月三十日開始辦公。</p>
<h3>榮子恒返防</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　暫編　十軍軍良榮子恒前偕師長孫夢悌來京，晉　當局，茲任務完畢、於五日乘車返防。</p>
<h3>東線德軍調整新陣綫　斯摩倫斯克區有劇戰</h3>
<p>沮里克六日中央社電　德軍當局前會言明因與反軸心軍職兵力相異，故已轉攻爲守，東綫之德軍經卡科夫及泰幹洛格之巧妙撤退作戰，似已逐漸向聶伯河一帶作有秩序之撤退，過去六十餘日間，東線戰況規模之大，戰鬥之烈，爲世界戰史所未有。以蘇軍犧牲之大而觀，其是否已收獲所期戰果，殊爲疑問。據德軍常局之統計，蘇軍於七月五日至八月廿六日問，死傷達一百八十萬，損失坦克車一萬六千輛，飛機五千架，大砲五千門。蘇軍以如此犧牲，始獲得若千進展，惟倘不能擊破德軍之野戰兵力，即不能奪回控制德軍死命之戰咯要地，徵諸德軍最近之作戰情形，其已轉爲巧妙防禦作戰者，當可明瞭德軍之作戰方針，爲滴於守時即極力防守，惟蘇軍兵力顯行增大時，即將陣地先行破壞而撤退。德軍司令庫爾戈將軍及曼斯坦將軍之此種撤退作戰，蘇軍司令查鮑西尼哥夫元帥似亦極感威脅。據觀　軍或已動員口口萬之預備兵專待蘇軍攻勢低落時斷然出以猛烈抗戰。東綫之夏季作戰尙未到達最後階段，當此雨季之前，德軍與蘇軍之戰略均已顯　一極礎妙動向，蘇聯新聞界之急於要求英美急速結成第二戰錢，亦足以說明歐洲戰局已臨重大轉機。</p>
<p>莫斯科六日中央社電　據此間昨晚宜稱：沿莫斯科至斯摩倫斯克公路之戰事，其激烈狀况一如唐納資盆地及烏克　北部，該處地區之德軍，方使用其巨型「虎」坦克車及福迭南大砲，以應付來攻之蘇軍。</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　海通社本日自德國權威方面獲悉：德軍繼續縮短東綫南　之陣線，蘇軍指揮企圖阻撓德軍之避離運動，並以大量坦克車企圖突破德軍之防綫皆未得逞。蘇坦克車一隊在卡科夫之西進攻，遭德軍後備軍反攻擊退，在奥勒爾西面地區，蘇軍坦克車密集進攻，亦遭德軍砲火完全擊潰，蘇坦克車三百四十九輛中有四分之一以上被擊毀。</p>
<p>蘇軍在芬蘭灣試圖登陸失敗</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德國新聞社訉：德軍沿海防禦砲，日昨擊退企圖在芬蘭拉杜加　東岸登陸之蘇軍，蘇艦亦擬衡入海灣中，但被德艦發　當即發砲，敵艦不及還擊即退</p>
<h3>法荷沿岸德英海空戰</h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　據倫敦來電稱·英海軍部五日夜發表公報稱：英輕艦隊於五日黎明在法國海岸與德海軍哨戒艇遭遇，交戰達兩小時始撤退</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德國新聞社海軍訪員昨稱，英噴火式轟炸機三十架與雙引擎之驅遂機四架，淸晨襲擊在荷蘭口岸中之德小艦隊，敵機投彈數枚，並由低空開放緊張之砲火，德小艇立即以排砲火還擊，使敵之轟炸不能中的、港口設備亦未受傷，僅泊於港口外之荷蘭駁船一艘，直接中彈沉沒。　引擎驅逐機與噴火式轟炸機各一架被擊落，敵機隊長即在被擊落之噴火式轟炸機中被擒，其駕駛員亦被捕，我艇司令一名戰死，船員數人受傷，但艦艇無一損失。</p>

<h3>水雷戰隊南洋血戰記</h3>
<p>美國，大吹大擂地在說一九四三年爲「決戰年」，企圖一擊即挽囘已經的敗績，而在向西南太平洋大批動員一切的人力與物力，就是有這個地方不斷進行着你死我活的最激烈鬥爭。自從開戰以來，充任驅逐艦〇〇艦長，參與多次海戰，建立赫赫武勳的〇〇中校，近來歸還〇〇基地。下而就是該中校初次所諸出來的日本海軍至　水雷戰隊的「雨太平洋血戰記」，也就是向後方呼　的前綫聲音。</p>
<p>潛入敵艦海峽</p>
<p>日本水雷戰隊在此次戰爭中所獲得的最大戰果中而應大寫特　者，是所羅門的夜戰和倫特巴島的攻擊。然而這全是偶發的戰鬥，當然還不能說，我們水雷戰隊，已經發揮了眞正的帝國獨特的猛攻，因而正式的水雷戰隊的實力，尙朱暴露於全世界，瓜達卡那爾島驅逐艦的任務，是非常重大的，無論那一艘艦，都不抱着生還的決心，迫近瓜達卡那爾島的我方哨戒機，不斷地向我們報告。</p>
<p>「美國巡洋艦和驅逐數艘哨戒中。」</p>
<p>須臾間，在我們的　遠鏡中便出現了類似桅杆尖的柬西。再迫近一下距離的時候，敵人突然用猛烈的防禦砲火開始向我們哨戒機放射。「他媽的，現在就給你們個眼色看看！」我們便開足馬力向敵人衝去。砲轟和雷擊的準備早已準備好。還有五分鐘，但到了這個時候，敵人一定逃避到慈拉基海峽去了，因爲這差不多已經成爲他們的常事了。</p>
<p>他們對於夜戰，在許多次戰鬥經騐中是很知道沒有戰勝希望的。我們不管三七二十一　竟向瓜島前進。這正如收起劍法而投入敵人懷抱去一樣。但我們的驅逐艦隊，是跳入死地而開關活路的意思，即置之死地而後生之意。在陸海軍部隊完全完成任務前，我們只是暫時停泊着不動。敵人突然向我們的艦艇實行猛烈的轟炸。雖然如此，我們在任務末完成前，遼是　亳不動地忍耐下去。</p>
<p>敵人照例在轟炸之外，還出動六批魚雷艇。敵人的飛機塲和基地，是眼睛可以看到的海上。在航行中如遇到魚雷艇，則我們的驅逐艦就使艦體停下來，减低動搖，而開始砲轟。這樣就不會浪費砲彈，可能一發即中，在生死關頭的時侯，爲了生則只有拿出剛毅的胆力來。</p>
<p>舍特　島的基地，每天不分晝夜，敵人的大型機　B十七型不斷地飛來。我方的戰鬥機一追趕的時候，B十七型飛機，就鑽入雲　去，但傾刻間還會囘來的。我們稱這種B十七型爲「銀色蒼蠅」（即討厭之意）。</p>
<p>且這種「銀色蒼蠅」不管下雨刮風，也不管伸手不見　的黑夜，總是不客氣地來。大家都笑談着銀色蒼蠅，但精神都非常的鎭靜。</p>
<p>常敵人空襲時，如一聽到「空襲：」再準備，那已經遲了。所以驅逐艦的艦長有一次竟　疲備不堪的部下慢慢地睡下去，然而假如當時部下答應了這樣的事情，那末那種愛部下的心，就會成了害部下了。所以全都整裝枕戈待旦，一出緊急事故，馬上就可以射擊。</p>
<p>帶着重大任務，早晨向〇〇出航時，就得到了敵人的潛水艇。但潛水艇在航行迅速的驅逐艦來看，簡直不成問題。同時若一一的和潛水艇打交涉，則驅逐艦領到任務就不能完成了，只好捨棄牠們。</p>
<p>擺脫潛水艇後，B十七型的「銀色蒼蠅」又飛來了。在〇〇公尺處始終監視着我們的船，無論走到何處，總是和我們糾纏不淸。由於敵機的電台，須臾間竟來了無數敵機，我便對不下說我平常喜歡說的話「今天能擊落幾架飛機呢？擊落一架就是登陸一天」，於是兵士們濟脆地囘答說·「我們打算住四天」。這秤鎭靜的玩笑，甚至在最危急的時候我們也這樣談。緊接着就是空與海的空前大格鬥。</p>
<p>飛下來的敵機，先由蜻蜓樣的大小，突然成爲鳥般大小，而艦的周圍，雄壯的水柱到處便湧起來。艦就像完全曉得躱避投下來的炸彈一樣，左轉右旋。敵人的空襲，並不是單純轟炸，有時候也夾雜着雷擊。好容易等到敵人離去而沉靜下來的時候，但並不發「停止轟擊！」的號令。因爲如一發這樣號令，則兵士會目瞪口呆起來。</p>
<p>漂浮機的撞碰</p>
<p>有一天的事。在我們艦的天空上，有漂浮機在護送着。當時有B十七型飛機五架和戰鬥機多架襲來。突然便在天空上展開了猛烈的空戰。交綏不及十數分，在雲端上突然出現了一個紅色花火，而一個龐然大物的B十七型就直綫地落下來。艦上的人們都雀　着，大聲喊。。「萬歲！擊落一架了！」在這個期間，隨着B十七型下來的是張開的兩個降落傘，慢慢地降落到海面上。</p>
<p>就在這同一個時間，我們不知道爲什麽，敵機羣就開始零星地散開了，一隻我方的軍艦迅速地去接降落傘，而我們就先囘〇〇基地去</p>
<p>每位砲　長都爭論着說，是自己的軍艦擊落的。正在橫飛着嘴邊唾沬而各自說是自己打下來的時候、從傍面就有人搭話說，「大家都想錯了」，說這話的，是去接降落傘的艦長，而根據這位艦長的話，才知道B十七型是誰打下來的。據說我方的水上機衝入敵機羣的最中間，就一直地斷然向敵人指揮官機撞碰。在雲端上突然看到花火時，就是這個時候的火，B十七型緩緩地落下來，但實行撞碰的漂浮機也就化爲灰塵了。</p>
<p>聽到這一點，我們眞是覺得慚愧萬分，同時對於以漂浮機來撞碰B十七型的我們海鷹之偉大精神，只有喳舌驚嘆。再說撞碰這一件事本身，即使海鷹有這種令人歌頌的偉大精神，但眞能鐘碰上敵機也是一件絕大的困雜事。因爲二者間速度有極大的不同，漂浮機比起B十七型來說，眞是小巫見大巫，若談到撞碰，是在普通數學上得不出來的答案。慰勞品袋中的蠶豆</p>
<p>有一天從長子讀書的國民學校裏寄給我一個慰勞袋，其中裝着一個「蠶豆」罐頭，當時我只是把牠好好收藏起來，等到最後的一刻吃。現在受到激烈凄慘的轟炸，甲板上業已落上〇顆炸彈，甚至砲塔都炸倒了。在這樣激戰的一天，敵機飛走後，自已認爲今天就是最後的一刻了，所以急忙打開罐頭。其中有十粒蠶豆。把兩粒蠶豆放到嘴裏的時候·似乎像作夢一樣、眞覺得味道特別香，足使我一生不能忘掉</p>
<p>我把砲術長叫來，讓他吃其餘的蠶豆。而最喜歡吃香東西的砲術長只吃了一粒就不吃了。我問：「你怎麼了」？他說：「其給的就給航海長和水雷長留着吃吧！」於是就把航海長和水雷長叫來，這兩個人也只吃了兩粒，便說：「還有機關長和機關少尉呢，應當也給他們　　」，這樣說完，便走開了。機關長和機關少尉也各自吃了一粒，便交給了上士，上士吃了一粒後，便留下最後的兩粒問說：「可以交給兵卒吃麼？」我便心頭　際覺得一酸，而認爲「這就是我們帝國海軍强勝無敵的地方」。</p>
<p>從奔走於〇〇方面的朋友處寄來了一盒巧克力糖，有一次在新幾內亞激戰數夜從未得到一眠的時候，是一個晚上，我便把巧克力　分成小塊，一塊一塊地放至士兵的嘴里。而每一個兵士都不看我的臉，只是默默地含着巧克力糖，同時仍然在望遠鏡裏繼續不斷地張望着敵人。訓練既達到這步程度，可以說是什麽也不必怕了。艦長和水兵——在戰鬥中的我們，當此時都湧現出一種堅强的自信！「決不能敗於美國」。</p>
<p>希望速派飛機來！</p>
<p>敵人美國的戰法，可以說是日新月異，向來不採取同樣的戰法。如說他們是好　喜變的國民性之結果，也無不可，但他們經常建立新的計劃，採取新的戰法，這一點決不可以輕視的。</p>
<p>敵人還對於建造軍艦也非常的快。但關於軍艦，如上至艦長下　一個水兵，不能團結一致，則戰鬥力完全會等於零。無論艦如何新，如何好，都不足怕。總之，帝國水雷戰隊發揮眞正威力的時候，這剛要開始、隨着這種　　戰隊，如再有更多的　機、那來戰爭就可以完全由我們支配。我在最後再鄭重地說一句：「派更多的飛機到前綫來！」——（海軍報道班員吉田由〇〇基地發）（漢譯自八月二十四日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>要人財產</h3>
<p>義王於　索里尼下臺及法西斯　解散後，即任命一委員會下令査抄前法西斯黨要員財產。該委員會已於九月二日發表一官式公告，略請：「義大利全國已開始查抄前法西斯黨要員之貴重財產，現時查悉有非法積聚財產行爲者，計有前任部長次長及大使等多人……巳被起訴，而對於前外長齊亞諾夫婦之財產査抄尤嚴，其大部財產已被査抄，現仍　續偵査其餘財產」。</p>
<p>凡讀了上段新聞的，終覺有一種快感吧！尤其是墨氏婿女齊亞諾夫婦財產之查抄尤嚴，更能使讀者發生一種怏感，就是　信仰一種主義。本書爲國爲民，今竟借公濟私，上發其橫財，自然逃不了人民的耳目；一至局勢轉變，黨勢由盛而　，則樹　猢猻散，橫財還須吐了出來。實在也是一種報應</p>
<p>主義本無罪，實行主義者的爲非作歹，乃便主義有　；主義本無好歹，實行主義者的貪汚自私，乃使主義有好歹</p>
<p>其實，主義之最可貴者即爲主義的本身，而實行主義中最可貴的行爲，則爲廉潔，有人格。否則什麽主義，十九也是不會光明的，而要人財產，乃成爲任何主義之玷！</p>

<p>爲各項證券之現期及定期買賣，惟爲防止投機操縱起見，對期貨之買賣，暫不承做，至於營業方針，買賣證券之理類，以及　手費　渡費　額等，業由理事會考　　定，該交易所又</p>
<p>設評議會</p>

<p>商情摘要</p>
<p>公債昨仍上漲無力，多戶雖能拉拾，但仍未能壓制賣戶之踴躍，故有再而表之象。大半亦因環境雖利多，而銀根未與方便，是以抑而不竄，但抑之過久，必有反　也。昨丙種初微高，比上週價，但入後仍　供過於求，市况依然不振，終乃下降，比上週反小。甲乙丁戊四種均已入關。</p>

<h3>怎樣實踐對華新政策</h3>
<p>— 緋田</p>
<p>本文是友邦思　界權威緋田工先生在上海內河輸船公司演講的大意。氏指出日本人在上海不受中國人尊敬的原因，在於忘却了日本的的本來而目·結論說實踐對華新政策必須首先排除英美思想的殘滓·這樣自　的精神，量値得欽佩的。（譯者註）</p>
<p>新政策的內容</p>
<p>對華新政策這句話，最近甚　塵上·這新政策究竟是什麽？能夠明確地把握其實體的，即使在日本人之中，又有多少呢？我想一定爲數不多。到現在爲止的所謂對華政策，尙未十分明確。民衆固不必說，即指導者亦不淸楚，一般大衆聽從這不了解的指導者的指導，所以弄得更不淸楚了。於是這不淸不楚的事實，從中國事襲一直展開到大束亞戰爭。可是儘管大家都這樣不求甚解，然而所走的却大致是很良好的方向，這實有神助，誠爲我們稀有的團體所致。</p>
<p>話歸本題，此次對華新政策的目標，和大東亞建設的目標是相當一致的。大東亞建設由於大東亞戰爭的意義而可以明瞭·大東亞戰爭的目的，和中國事變的目的是一貫的，而大東亞民族的指導，和建設中國又是一貫的。</p>
<p>確立自己信念</p>
<p>現在從事建設中國的人們的心理狀態，很類似幕未時代人士的心理，明治維新的幕臣，誰也不知道維新以後的情形將如何，但不管知與不知，一致向應走的方向前進。</p>
<p>我們自己覺得迷惑的時候，當要求他人的指導，但是眞正應該在這裏求的，却是自己的信念，信念決不是依賴他人能夠獲得的東西。換句話說，用他人的力量，不能製造自己的信念。自己的信念，唯有賴自己的良心，即天性始能獲得。</p>
<p>去除私慾心裏</p>
<p>很多人說中國人在迷惑當中，其實這大東亞民族的指導者日本人本身也正在迷惑中。以迷惑的日本人而想領導中國人，所以弄得更迷惑了，許冬人都被囿於追求一己的私慾的心理。而想另立旗幟，日本人本來祇有一面國旗就夠了，然而再想在那上面另立起一面自己的旗來，因而也不被中國人尊敬了。這是當然的事，不足爲奇，日本人把實踐正當的事感到喜悅。所以應該毫不躊躇，亳不疑慮地實踐。</p>
<p>例如：說到此次業已實行的交還租界，一部份日本人以爲即使交還租界，在中國人方面，感謝的意思也很　　。本來這是應該可喜的，然而他們不是欣喜而却憂悶。　這在日本人是件可恥的事。亞細亞民族的「皇化統一」，卽是顯現其原來應有本質的統一，稱之爲「　伸之道」，「八　，宇」，發揮日本人的能力，用大和精神，無論在道義上，在武力上，勇往直前的邁　。此次我們不過做了當然應做的事，如其使　方欣喜，固然很好，如其不感欣喜，也無所其用愼憑。在消滅大東亞之恥等的租界存在之日，在八月一日交還租界之日，上海沒有幾個日本人高揭　旗以表慶祝。這在我實覺得痛心。</p>
<p>回復本來面目</p>
<p>總之，對華政策的實踐，日水人如其不復返於日本人的本來面目，是絕對不可能的。我相信日本人如其大家都復返做一個眞正的日本人，那麼，中國事變的解決一定是可能的。以陸下的大御心來做自己的心，而躬行實踐，則一切問題均可容易解決，如其漠視這一點，想以自己淺　的思想來推行，那麼就是可以解決的也不能解決了，</p>
<p>發揮產靈精神</p>
<p>國策公司中，　着前述另張旗幟的心理的日本入，爲　很多。中日人的待遇差別等，都是不能不大加考慮的問　，雖然或許因種種情形而不能一舉即加改　，但内逐漸加以改着，提使中國職員覺悟從「　死」到「同生　的意義，在　塲中日本和中國密切地　繫起來，用「產靈精神」，「大和精神」未發揮之。</p>
<p>總之，大東亞共榮　的確立，也就是在大東亞中組織保甲，在英美思想沒落後的今日，其指導精神應以我國肇國以來所　的「　靈精神」來取而代之。差別待遇或榨取等　事，不必說自是蹈　英美的所謂自由主義的覆轍，尤以「商業精神」。在商業都市中已成爲一種最腐敗的習性。這些都已到達了改組的時期了。</p>
<p>中日共同犧牲</p>
<p>日本　　了大東亞戰爭中的犧牲，同時，中國也當然應該分担其犧牲，使全中國民衆樂於協力分担，絕對不能用英美的榨取思想，運用欺騙蒙詐這類伎倆，中國人遠比日本人來得精明，猶太人更爲拿手，日本人望塵莫及。所以我們　論如何必須誠心誠　的用　靈思想及大和精神來感化，增强　產力的問題，也可以用這種精神力來解決，而得以實　，</p>
<p>我敢斷言，對華新政策的實　，應在我們切身的職塲中，完全　　英美思想的殘　，我想信滿位如其在職塲中加以切實的檢討，自然可以明瞭，這就是我的結論（一鳴羣之合譯）</p>

<h3>On Talent and Employing People</h3>
<p>Sima Guang once said: "The way to govern is none better than to obtain the right people. When all officials are competent, all affairs are well managed." The so-called "obtaining the right people" naturally refers to talent. Having obtained talent, one must also be good at employing it, matching ability with position, so that "all affairs are well managed." The core of Sima Guang's words is that talent and its employment are equally important. Considering the present situation, although times have changed and political environments differ, the truth in these words is fully applicable and irrefutable.</p>
<p>Talent is relative, not absolute. It must be compared to reveal the degree of ability; it must be employed appropriately to realize its efficiency. For example, if A and B hold the same position and A performs better than B, this comparison reveals the difference in their abilities. Furthermore, if A, who studied law, is made to do accounting, and B, who studied accounting, becomes a law clerk, the result, even if not failure, will certainly be inefficient. Learning is not applied to what one studies, and what one uses is not what one has learned; for the individual, years of hard work are wasted. For the nation, a decade of education produces no talent. They complain and blame each other.</p>
<p>Since the late Qing Dynasty, China's politics has not been on the right track, and administrative organs have accumulated many malpractices. Although the reasons are varied, the unsoundness of personnel management is undoubtedly a major key. During the late Qing and early Republic, most administrative personnel were corrupt officials, deeply entrenched in bad habits and lacking ability, resulting in a dark and chaotic political situation. Commentators attributed this to the failure to universally promote new education and the fact that political figures had not undergone school education. Today, the promotion of new education can be said to be quite long-standing, and most political personnel have been trained in schools. However, political improvement is still far from our expectations, and the accumulated bad habits of administrative organs have not been cleared up. The most important reason is that the function of education is limited to the scope of schools. Those who have received school training completely forget the spirit of their school days once they leave school and enter society, assimilating into the deeply entrenched environment. Gradually, they change their original appearance, willingly joining the ranks of the corrupt officials of the past. This not only affects the low administrative efficiency, but also makes political morality increasingly degenerate.</p>
<p>Therefore, the issue of talent is particularly important today. The current reality is that administrative organs feel a lack of talent, a "talent panic." If we analyze the reasons for this panic: first, politics is still not on the right track. Political disputes with specialized nature need talent with specialized knowledge, but are filled with mediocre people. Even if there are a few specialized talents, they are rejected and unable to be employed. Second, since politics does not value specialized talent, most young people avoid difficult tasks. Thus, the study of arts and law is particularly prevalent, while the study of specialized technology gradually decreases. Of course, there is also a need for arts and law talent, but they are naturally not competent when employed in specialized positions. Third, the government establishes few academic institutions for specialized research, and provides little reward or support for private research groups, which has a great impact on the cultivation of specialized talent. All three points are the main reasons for the talent panic today.</p>
<p>As for the way to employ people, if one can "know people and make good use of them," it can also passively remedy the talent panic. The so-called "knowing people" means that before employing someone, one must carefully examine their strengths and weaknesses, use their strengths, tolerate their weaknesses, and ensure that their talent matches their position, so as to maximize their ability. This is a very simple idea, but in reality, few can truly achieve it. The current general situation is not without the phenomenon of "there are things to do but no one to do them," or "there are people doing everything, but nothing is done well." Using small talent for big tasks can easily delay opportunities; or there are too many duties, responsibilities are not focused, and talent is wasted. Therefore, after "knowing people," it is necessary to assign certain talents to certain positions, focusing their duties and unifying their powers. We believe this will certainly improve political efficiency.</p>
<p>The so-called "making good use of" means absolute trust and absolute care. If it is determined that someone is truly talented, they must be particularly cherished, given full authority, and not be suspected or hindered, so that they do not feel insecure in their position; nor should they be frequently replaced, so that they do not have a short-term, fleeting mentality, only seeking to muddle through for the moment, and are unable to focus on diligent and effective governance.</p>
<p>If we further analyze the standard of employing people and political efficiency, they are directly proportional. If the standard of employing people tends towards private considerations, political efficiency will inevitably be low. For example: employing people without regard to talent, but only to personal connections. Employing people with the concept of hometown or region. Things gather by type, and they combine for private interests. The Jiang, Song, and Kong trio of the Chongqing regime used people who were either relatives or fellow villagers. If someone becomes prominent through kinship or hometown ties, then even if that person is useless, they become an omnipotent genius, capable of doing anything, but the result is inevitably that nothing is done well. What is even more ridiculous is that the wives and concubines of government officials interfere in politics, forming the phenomenon of exclusive favoritism and abuse of power seen in autocratic eras, such as Song Meiling and Song Ailing in the Chongqing regime. This is the biggest reason for the decline of politics.</p>
<p>To get politics back on track and achieve a state of good governance, "meritocracy" is absolutely necessary in employing people. Those who are truly talented and competent for their positions, even if they are from private circles, even if they are against us, can be hired, purely for the sake of efficiency. This kind of attitude and capacity should be present. Therefore, we advocate that the issue of dealing with talent and employing people must adopt a system of open examinations and strict evaluations, without the affection or aversion of personal emotions, only based on the quality of talent as the standard, entrusting those with talent to appropriate and important tasks. Those who hold positions without performing their duties must be dismissed. The selection of those to be promoted should be based on talent as the standard, so that the abuses of seniority and qualifications can be improved. And to prevent those with talent from being suppressed in the wilderness and enable them to develop their strengths.</p>
<p>We propose meritocracy as a ladder for correcting the biases in personnel matters of government agencies and putting politics on the right track.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Coordinate in Fierce Battle on New Guinea Island; Enemy Ships Heavily Damaged Near Hobba</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 12:00 noon on the 6th: On September 2nd, approximately 40 enemy aircraft attacked Wewak Harbor on New Guinea Island, attacking our transport ships docked in the harbor. Our fighter squadron and ground fire immediately engaged them, shooting down 19 enemy aircraft. One of our transport ships sank.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 6th: On the morning of September 4th, enemy forces began landing near Hobba, 35 kilometers east of Lae on New Guinea Island, with a strong transport fleet. The Japanese army and navy immediately dispatched forces. Through close cooperation, they attacked the enemy forces near the landing site and at sea. So far, the confirmed results are as follows: 6 enemy transport ships, 1 cruiser, and many boats sunk. In addition, 5 enemy transport ships and 2 destroyers were hit and caught fire. 27 enemy fighters were shot down. Japanese losses include 9 aircraft bombed or not returning.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces in the New Guinea area are currently engaged in fierce battles with enemy forces near Lae, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. At the same time, the Japanese air force is also coordinating with ground troops, strongly attacking enemy air force bases, thoroughly destroying enemy air force strength, and securing air supremacy. The Japanese army's ground air defense units are also accurately firing at attacking enemy aircraft, demonstrating considerable activity. According to the announcement of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, Japanese aircraft and air defense units intercepted approximately 40 enemy aircraft attacking Wewak on New Guinea Island on the 2nd, shooting down 19 of them. The enemy aircraft, approximately 40 in number, attacked the Japanese military base at Wewak at 8:30 AM on September 2nd, attacking Japanese transport ships docked in the harbor. However, because personnel and military supplies had already been landed and unloaded, there were no losses except for one transport ship being sunk. In contrast, enemy aircraft were shot down by Japanese fighters (6 P-38s and 8 B-15s, totaling 14). Ground fire also shot down 2 P-38s and 3 B-25s (5 in total), bringing the total to 19. The remaining aircraft retreated in panic.</p>
<h3>Results of Japanese Air Squadron Operations in the Solomon Islands Area; Fierce Air Battle Over Bougainville</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – On the night of the 3rd, a Japanese naval seaplane squadron discovered 4 enemy torpedo boats off the south coast of Kolombangara Island and launched a fierce attack, destroying two of them. Japanese seaplanes also attacked Bairoko on Georgia Island twice in the pre-dawn hours of the 3rd and 4th. Because it was night, the results were unclear. Also, on the evening of the 3rd, a Japanese naval air squadron bombed enemy positions in the Munda area. The results were also unclear.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – On the morning of the 4th, the American air force in the Southwest Pacific area, with a large formation of 66 aircraft, including Douglas bombers and Corsair fighter aircraft, attacked Japanese positions on Kolombangara Island. Japanese ground units responded with heavy artillery fire, shooting down 7 American aircraft. The rest fled, and Japanese losses were light.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a radio dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, on the morning of the 3rd, a large joint formation of 59 American aircraft, including 29 large bombers and 30 Corsair fighters, attacked Japanese positions southeast of Bougainville Island. The Japanese fighter squadron intercepted them over the island. After a fierce air battle lasting several tens of minutes, they destroyed 2 large bombers and 2 Corsair fighters. The rest fled, and Japanese losses were light.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Admits to Japanese Air Raids</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 6th (Central News Agency) – Army and naval air force units have been fiercely attacking American air force bases stationed in Chongqing for days. A Chongqing radio broadcast also admitted that Jian'ou in Fujian Province and Wuzhou in Guangxi Province were subjected to Japanese air raids on the 3rd and 4th, suffering considerable damage. It also stated that other locations were also attacked by Japanese aircraft.</p>
<h3>Thai Military Delegation Visits Japanese Army and Navy Ministries</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Lieutenant General Phya Phichai Rit, head of the Thai military delegation, along with five representatives, visited the Japanese Army and Navy Ministries on the 6th, presenting each ministry with a gold gift.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Conference Revises List of Major Commodities Under the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – The government previously decided at an Executive Yuan conference to revise the list of major commodities under the Ministry of Industry. The Executive Yuan has announced the revised list as follows: Cotton, Cotton yarn, Cotton products (including cloth and knitted goods), Chemical industrial products (including raw materials, pigments, dyes, and alcohol), Wool and its products, Cocoons and silk products, Industrial oils, Candles, Soap, Matches, Lump coal and coal balls, Cigarettes and tobacco leaves, Rubber (including raw materials and products), Hardware (including raw materials and products of iron, steel, galvanized iron, and non-ferrous metals), Glass (including raw materials and products), Electrical appliances (including raw materials and products), Leather (including raw materials and products), Fur and fur products.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister Aoki Visits Prime Minister Tojo; Reports on Inspection Trip to China and Manchuria</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki visited Prime Minister Tojo at 3:30 PM on the 6th, reporting on his inspection trip to China and Manchuria and holding various important discussions.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki met with a group of reporters at the Ministry of Greater East Asia at 5:30 PM on the 6th, and made a statement on his inspection trip to China and Manchuria. The gist of his statement is as follows: I departed from Tokyo on August 19th, visiting various regions of China including Central China, North China, Xinjiang, and Manchuria, before returning to Tokyo on the 5th.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Cooperation Becomes Increasingly Close</p>
<p>When I visited the Republic of China, I had frank and sincere conversations with President Wang Jingwei and various important officials of the National Government. In general, Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new phase due to Japan's implementation of a new policy towards China at the beginning of this year and China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States. The closeness of cooperation has become increasingly deeper. President Wang and the important officials of the National Government can understand Japan's true intentions, and their courageous spirit of carrying out the war and building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is increasingly firm. They are also making the greatest efforts to strengthen and improve the wartime situation, expand administrative power, maintain public order, improve national morale, and increase production. Furthermore, the number of intellectuals among the Chinese people who understand the purpose of Japan's new policy has gradually increased. The entire purpose of Japan's new policy, such as abolishing extraterritoriality and returning concessions, is to help China achieve independence and autonomy, and to respect China's independence. Among these intellectuals, the significance of their actively cooperating with Japan to resolve the current situation in order to promote China's revival is growing daily. As for Chongqing, it is still relying on aid from Britain and the United States, and is only capable of guerrilla warfare and propaganda warfare. Although it vainly hopes that the anti-Axis powers will achieve final victory in the world war, the fighting power of Chongqing has recently become greatly weakened, and its economic difficulties can no longer be concealed. Judging from the impact of the world war and the current complex economic situation, efforts are still needed to fundamentally resolve the Sino-Japanese problem. However, I believe that wise Chinese people cannot fail to assess the future trend of East Asia, nor can they fail to understand Japan's sincerity. After my visit to China this time, I am convinced that Japan, based on its established policies, will promote various measures. At the same time, due to China's self-awareness, the relationship between China and Japan will be able to return to its original state.</p>
<p>Abundant Harvests of Agricultural Products in Various Regions Visited</p>
<p>Next, when I visited Manchuria, I saw that the country's political, economic, transportation, and other sectors had made astonishing progress, especially the development of the iron and steel industry and other heavy industries. The country is currently cooperating greatly with Japan to carry out the Greater East Asia War, making many contributions, such as providing important resources such as iron and food. This is the current situation that I witnessed. During my visits to Central China, North China, Xinjiang, and Manchuria, the abundant harvests of agricultural products were all above expectations, demonstrating divine favor. I previously inspected the South, and now I have visited China and Manchuria, observing the cooperation between the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia and Japan to carry out Greater East Asia. As a result, my belief in certain victory has become increasingly strong.</p>
<h3>National Political Work Conference Scheduled to Be Held in Nanjing; Seeking to Strengthen Political Training of Troops</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Military Affairs Commission is scheduled to convene a National Political Work Conference on the 9th of this month. Its purpose is: Since the reorganization of military organizations eight months ago, this political work conference will review the past political training work of the army, navy, and air force, and plan for future unified implementation, in order to strengthen the political training of the troops. Since the National Government's entry into the war, in order to make the troops deeply understand that China's independent survival must be obtained through victory in the Greater East Asia War, and thereby comprehensively exert military strength, political training work is particularly important. Therefore, the focus of this conference is 1. To implement the New Life Movement in the army, navy, and air force, follow the military creed, and launch a total mobilization of the spirit of the troops, in order to strive to complete the goal of the Greater East Asia War. 2. The understanding that political training personnel should have after the National Government's entry into the war and the promotion of future work. There are more than 50 units attending the conference, including the chiefs of political training departments of various front armies, army groups, and divisions, the directors of political training of various military schools and military institutions, and the chiefs of the third sections of the security departments of various provinces and cities. The attendees from the capital and Hankou have already reported. The attendees from North China and Guangdong will also arrive in the next two days. At that time, the conference will also invite representatives from relevant military training organizations to attend the meeting in order to seek close contact between political training and military training. Ninety proposals have been received in recent days. It is expected that there will be a new contribution to the political training work in the future. It is also learned that the venue for the National Political Work Conference is the National Government Auditorium. The conference will last for three days from the 9th to the 11th. The Secretary-General of the General Assembly Secretariat is Zhou, Director of the Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission. It is divided into four groups: agenda, reception, documents, and affairs, which are assigned to the section chiefs of the General Affairs Department of Political Training of the Military Affairs Commission. With the opening date approaching, the Secretariat has been working since August 30th.</p>
<h3>Rong Ziheng Returns to Defense</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – Rong Ziheng, commander of the Provisional 10th Army, previously came to Nanjing with Division Commander Sun Mengti to meet with the authorities. His mission has now been completed, and he returned to his defense area by train on the 5th.</p>
<h3>German Army on Eastern Front Adjusts New Line; Heavy Fighting in Smolensk Region</h3>
<p>Zurich, 6th (Central News Agency) – German military authorities previously stated that due to differences in troop strength with the anti-Axis powers, they have shifted from offensive to defensive. The German army on the Eastern Front, after the skillful withdrawal operations from Kharkov and Taganrog, seems to have gradually made an orderly withdrawal towards the Dnieper River area. The scale of the battles on the Eastern Front in the past sixty days or so and the intensity of the fighting are unprecedented in world military history. Considering the great sacrifices made by the Soviet army, it is doubtful whether they have achieved the expected results. According to statistics from the German army, from July 5th to August 26th, the Soviet army suffered 1.8 million casualties, losing 16,000 tanks, 5,000 aircraft, and 5,000 artillery pieces. With such sacrifices, the Soviet army has only made some progress. However, if they cannot defeat the German army's field forces, they cannot retake strategic locations that control the fate of the German army. Judging from the German army's recent operations, it is clear that they have shifted to a skillful defensive operation. The German army's operational policy is to defend vigorously when it is suitable for defense. However, when the Soviet army's strength increases significantly, they destroy the positions in advance and retreat. The Soviet army commander, Marshal Zhukov, seems to feel extremely threatened by this kind of withdrawal operation by the German army commanders, General Kurt von Tippelskirch and General Erich von Manstein. It is observed that the German army may have mobilized 100,000 reserve troops, waiting for the Soviet army's offensive to weaken before launching a fierce counterattack. The summer operations on the Eastern Front have not yet reached the final stage. Before the rainy season, the strategies of both the German and Soviet armies have revealed a very subtle trend. The eagerness of the Soviet press to demand that Britain and the United States quickly form a second front is also sufficient to illustrate that a major turning point has come to the European war situation.</p>
<p>Moscow, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a statement here last night, the battles along the Moscow-Smolensk highway are as fierce as those in the Donets Basin and northern Ukraine. The German army in that area is using its giant Tiger tanks and Ferdinand artillery to deal with the attacking Soviet army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Havas News Agency learned today from authoritative German sources that the German army is continuing to shorten its lines on the southern sector of the Eastern Front. The Soviet command attempted to obstruct the German army's withdrawal movement and attempted to break through the German defense line with a large number of tanks, but failed. A Soviet tank force attacked west of Kharkov and was counterattacked by German reserve forces and repulsed. In the area west of Orel, concentrated attacks by Soviet tanks were completely shattered by German artillery fire. More than a quarter of the 349 Soviet tanks were destroyed.</p>
<p>Soviet Attempt to Land in Gulf of Finland Fails</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a German news agency, coastal defense artillery yesterday repelled a Soviet army that attempted to land on the east coast of the Gulf of Ladoga in Finland. Soviet ships also attempted to enter the bay, but were spotted by German ships, which immediately opened fire. The enemy ships retreated without returning fire.</p>
<h3>German-British Naval and Air Battles Off the French and Dutch Coasts</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from London, the British Admiralty issued a bulletin on the night of the 5th stating that a British light fleet encountered German naval patrol boats off the French coast at dawn on the 5th and engaged in battle for two hours before withdrawing.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – A German news agency naval correspondent stated yesterday that 30 British Spitfire bombers and 4 twin-engine fighter planes attacked a small German fleet in a Dutch port in the early morning. The enemy aircraft dropped several bombs and opened intense fire from low altitude. The small German boats immediately returned fire with multiple guns, causing the enemy's bombing to be inaccurate. The port facilities were also not damaged. Only one Dutch barge moored outside the port was directly hit and sunk. One engine destroyer and one Spitfire bomber were shot down. The enemy squadron leader was captured in the shot-down Spitfire bomber, and its pilot was also arrested. One of our boat commanders was killed in action, and several crew members were injured, but no ships were lost.</p>
<h3>Rumors of a Meeting Between the British, American, and Soviet Three Giants; Location and Date Undecided</h3>
<p>Geneva, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a German news agency dispatch from Washington, an agreement has been reached on a meeting between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. However, the location and time of the meeting are still under discussion. Roosevelt and Churchill will not hesitate to personally travel to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 6th (Central News Agency) – Churchill has been discussing relations with the Soviet Union with Roosevelt at the White House for several days. Recently, there have been frequent rumors that the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will hold a meeting. According to the highest official sources in Washington, the Soviet Foreign Minister will not attend this meeting of the three foreign ministers. Instead, Deputy Foreign Minister Maisky, who is currently in London, will represent the Soviet side. The US representative will also not be Hull, but a representative selected by the State Department will attend.</p>
<h3>Axis Forces Retreat to New Positions in Southern Italy; British Forces Land at Palmi</h3>
<p>Rome, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Italian Supreme Command announced on the 5th that the Italian army had withdrawn from Nicastro in Calabria.</p>
<p>Rome, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Italian Supreme Command announced today that the German and Italian forces in southern Italy have retreated to new positions. The Axis air force is continuing to attack enemy supply columns and engaged in fierce battles with British and American aircraft covering enemy ground forces. Enemy aircraft bombed areas such as Aversa, Capua, Formia, Villaritano, and Vitanlupo.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a German news agency military correspondent in the Mediterranean, the British army's attempt to encircle the rearguard of the German army in Calabria was forced to abandon due to heavy losses. British troops landing at Palmi in northern Calabria are pushing forward under the cover of British naval artillery.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a Swedish correspondent in London today, although the British are still unclear about the purpose of the Sicilian campaign, the general view is that the anti-Axis powers do not intend to occupy the entire Italian territory. It is reported that it is not necessarily a fact that the anti-Axis powers intend to launch an attack on Germany in northern Italy. The anti-Axis powers may consider taking action in the Balkans to be more advantageous. Therefore, General Montgomery will not be the hero of conquering Italy, but the advancing soldier of the Adriatic Sea.</p>
<h3>Representative Su Attends British Trade Union Congress</h3>
<p>Lisbon, September 6th, Central News Agency: London reports that ten Soviet representatives arrived yesterday at the port south of Lancaster to attend the Trade Union Congress, which opened today. It has been eighteen years since Soviet representatives participated in a British Labor conference. There will be two sessions this week that are of particular interest to the Soviet representatives: one is the Second Front issue, and the other is the expansion of the Anglo-Soviet Trade Union Committee to include representatives from other countries. Regarding these two issues, the British delegation recently sent to Moscow failed to reach an agreement with the Soviet side.</p>
<h3>Soviet Deputy Foreign Ministers Increase to Seven</h3>
<p>Moscow, September 6th, Central News Agency: Gavriil Ter-Ghazaryan has been promoted to Deputy Minister of the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee, bringing the number of deputy ministers in the Foreign Affairs People's Committee to seven.</p>
<h3>State Funeral of Former Bulgarian King Boris Held at Rila Monastery</h3>
<p>Sofia, September 6th, Central News Agency: Agence Havas reports that the remains of King Boris III of Bulgaria were laid to rest last night at 8:30 PM in the ancient thousand-year-old monastery in the Rila mountain valley south of the capital, after a state funeral ceremony. The vehicle carrying the stone coffin, along with royal family members, Prime Minister Filov, cabinet ministers, and two archbishops, arrived at the monastery gate at 7:30 PM. The Queen and Prince Kiril, along with other royal family members, followed the hearse, which entered the church to the sounds of bells and mourning music. After the monks scattered holy water, the hearse was moved to the prayer room on the right side of the church. At 8:30 PM, the hearse was entombed in the tomb, and the honor guard fired a salute. The tomb was covered with granite, engraved with the national flag and gold lettering, stating "Boris III, King of Bulgaria," born January 18, 1894, died August 28, 1943. As the King's remains were entombed, the capital's artillery batteries fired a salute.</p>
<h3>Ushuaia Port Placed Under Military Administration</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, September 6th, Central News Agency: The Argentine government has decided to place Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost part of South America, under military administration, and has appointed Navy Captain Yamadun as the governor of the area.</p>
<h3>Over Four Hundred Casualties in Paris Air Raid</h3>
<p>Paris, September 6th, Central News Agency: According to recent statistics, the Allied air force raid on Paris on the 3rd resulted in one hundred deaths and approximately three hundred injuries. A workers' residential area in northern France was almost completely destroyed in the Allied air raid, with approximately twenty-five deaths and approximately seventy-five injuries, all of whom were Chinese workers living there.</p>
<h3>War Record of a Minesweeper Squadron in the South Seas</h3>
<p>The United States is loudly proclaiming 1943 as the "Year of Decisive Battle," attempting to reverse its past defeats in one stroke. It is massively mobilizing all manpower and resources towards the Southwest Pacific, where fierce, life-or-death struggles are constantly taking place. Since the start of the war, Lieutenant Commander 〇〇, who served as the captain of a destroyer and participated in numerous naval battles, establishing outstanding military achievements, has recently returned to 〇〇 base. What follows is the Lieutenant Commander's initial account of the Japanese Navy's fierce minesweeper squadron's "Blood-Soaked War Record in the Pacific," a frontline voice calling out to the rear.</p>
<p>Sneaking Into Enemy-Held Straits</p>
<p>Among the greatest achievements of the Japanese minesweeper squadron in this war that deserve special mention are the night battles in the Solomon Islands and the attack on Runtbar Island. However, these were all incidental battles. It cannot yet be said that our minesweeper squadron has truly displayed the unique fierce attacks of the Empire, and therefore the true strength of the minesweeper squadron has not yet been revealed to the world. The task of the destroyers at Guadalcanal Island is extremely important. No ship embraces the determination to survive. Our patrol aircraft approaching Guadalcanal Island constantly report to us:</p>
<p>"American cruisers and several destroyers on patrol."</p>
<p>In a moment, something resembling a mast tip appeared in our binoculars. As we approached closer, the enemy suddenly began firing intense defensive artillery at our patrol aircraft. "Damn it, let's show them what we've got!" We went full speed ahead towards the enemy. Preparations for artillery fire and torpedo attacks were already complete. There were five minutes left, but by this time, the enemy would definitely escape to the 慈拉基 Strait, as this had almost become their routine.</p>
<p>Based on many combat experiences, they knew they had no hope of winning in a night battle. We advanced towards Guadalcanal Island regardless. This was like sheathing our swords and throwing ourselves into the enemy's embrace. But our destroyer fleet was jumping into a place of death to open up a path to life, meaning to put oneself in a do-or-die situation. We temporarily remained stationary until the army and naval forces had fully completed their mission. The enemy suddenly carried out intense bombing of our ships. Even so, we endured without moving an inch until the mission was completed.</p>
<p>As usual, in addition to bombing, the enemy also sent out six waves of torpedo boats. The enemy airfield and base were visible from the sea. When encountering torpedo boats during navigation, our destroyers would stop and reduce sway, and then begin artillery fire. This way, no shells would be wasted, and a direct hit was possible. At the critical moment of life and death, one had to show unwavering courage in order to survive.</p>
<p>From the base on Shete Island, the enemy's large B-17 aircraft constantly flew in day and night. When our fighter planes chased after them, the B-17 aircraft would dive into the clouds, but would return in an instant. We called these B-17 aircraft "Silver Flies" (meaning annoying).</p>
<p>And these "Silver Flies" came uninvited, regardless of rain or wind, or pitch-black nights. Everyone joked about the Silver Flies, but their spirits were very calm.</p>
<p>Usually, when the enemy air raid comes, it is already too late to prepare after hearing "Air Raid!" So, one day, the destroyer captain slowly laid down his exhausted subordinates to sleep. However, if the subordinates had agreed to such a thing at that time, then that love for the subordinates would have harmed them. So, everyone was fully equipped and on alert, ready to fire immediately in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>When setting sail from 〇〇 in the morning with an important mission, we encountered an enemy submarine. But from the perspective of a fast-moving destroyer, submarines were simply not a problem. At the same time, if we dealt with the submarines one by one, the destroyer would not be able to complete the mission it had been assigned, so we had to abandon them.</p>
<p>After shaking off the submarines, the B-17 "Silver Flies" flew in again. They constantly monitored our ship from 〇〇 meters away, always entangling us no matter where we went. Thanks to the enemy plane's radio, countless enemy planes came in an instant. I said to my subordinates what I usually liked to say: "How many planes can we shoot down today? Shooting down one plane is worth one day of rest." Then the soldiers crisply replied, "We plan to stay for four days." We talked in this calm manner even in the most critical moments. What followed was an unprecedented great battle in the air and sea.</p>
<p>The enemy planes flying down, first like the size of dragonflies, suddenly became the size of birds, and majestic water columns erupted everywhere around the ship. The ship seemed to know how to dodge the falling bombs, turning left and right. The enemy's air raids were not just simple bombing, but sometimes mixed with torpedo attacks. We waited until the enemy left and it calmed down with great difficulty, but we did not issue the order "Cease fire!" Because if such an order were issued, the soldiers would be dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The Collision of a Floatplane</p>
<p>One day. There was a floatplane escorting us in the sky above our ship. At that time, five B-17 aircraft and many fighter planes attacked. Suddenly, a fierce air battle unfolded in the sky. Less than ten minutes into the battle, a red firework suddenly appeared in the clouds, and a huge B-17 fell in a straight line. The people on the ship cheered and shouted, "Hooray! One plane shot down!" During this time, following the B-17 were two opened parachutes, slowly descending to the sea surface.</p>
<p>At the same time, we don't know why, the enemy planes began to scatter in a scattered manner. One of our warships quickly went to pick up the parachutes, while we first returned to 〇〇 base.</p>
<p>Each gunner was arguing, saying that their warship had shot it down. Just as they were wildly gesturing and claiming that they had shot it down, someone from the side interjected and said, "Everyone is wrong." The person who said this was the captain who went to pick up the parachutes, and according to this captain's words, we learned who had shot down the B-17. It is said that our seaplane charged into the middle of the enemy plane formation and resolutely crashed into the enemy commander's plane. The fire that was suddenly seen in the clouds at that time was the fire from this crash. The B-17 slowly fell, but the floatplane that carried out the crash was also reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Hearing this, we truly felt extremely ashamed, and at the same time, we could only gasp in amazement at the great spirit of our sea eagles who used floatplanes to crash into B-17s. Furthermore, even if the sea eagles had this laudable and great spirit, the act of crashing into an enemy plane itself was an extremely difficult task. This is because there is a huge difference in speed between the two. The floatplane is truly insignificant compared to the B-17. When it comes to crashing, it is an answer that cannot be obtained in ordinary mathematics.</p>
<p>Dried Broad Beans in the Comfort Package</p>
<p>One day, I received a comfort package from my eldest son's national school, which contained a can of "dried broad beans." At that time, I just carefully stored it away, waiting to eat it at the very last moment. Now, we were being subjected to intense and tragic bombing, and 〇 bombs had already landed on the deck, and even the gun turrets had been blown down. On this day of fierce battle, after the enemy planes flew away, I thought to myself that today was the last moment, so I hurriedly opened the can. There were ten dried broad beans inside. When I put two dried broad beans into my mouth, it seemed like a dream. I truly felt that the taste was particularly fragrant, enough to make me never forget it in my life.</p>
<p>I called the artillery officer over and let him eat the remaining dried broad beans. But the artillery officer, who loved to eat fragrant things the most, only ate one and didn't eat any more. I asked, "What's wrong?" He said, "Let's leave the rest for the navigation officer and the torpedo officer to eat!" So I called the navigation officer and the torpedo officer over, and these two people also only ate two and said, "There are also the chief engineer and the junior engineer, we should also give them some." After saying this, they walked away. The chief engineer and the junior engineer also each ate one and handed the last two over to the sergeant. After the sergeant ate one, he left the last two and asked, "Can I give them to the soldiers to eat?" I suddenly felt a twinge in my heart and thought, "This is where the invincible strength of our Imperial Navy lies."</p>
<p>A box of chocolates was sent to me by a friend who was running around in the 〇〇 area. One night, after several nights of fierce fighting in New Guinea without getting a wink of sleep, I divided the chocolates into small pieces and put them into the mouths of the soldiers one by one. But every soldier did not look at my face, but just silently held the chocolate in their mouths, while still constantly peering at the enemy through their binoculars. When training has reached this level, it can be said that there is nothing to fear. The captain and the sailors - we in battle, at this time, all felt a strong confidence! "We must not be defeated by the United States."</p>
<p>Hope Aircraft Are Dispatched Quickly!</p>
<p>It can be said that the enemy's (the United States') tactics are changing day by day, and they never adopt the same tactics. It may be said that this is the result of their fickle national character, but we must not underestimate the fact that they are constantly creating new plans and adopting new tactics.</p>
<p>The enemy is also building warships very quickly. But regarding warships, if everyone from the captain down to the lowest sailor cannot unite as one, then the combat power will be completely equal to zero. No matter how new or how good the ship is, there is nothing to fear. In short, the time when the Imperial minesweeper squadron will display its true power is just about to begin. Along with this strong squadron, if there are more planes, then the war can be completely dominated by us. I will say again solemnly at the end: "Send more planes to the front lines!" -- (Report from Navy Reporting Team member Yoshida from 〇〇 Base) (Translated from the August 24th Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>New Union Association Hosted a Reception for the Fleet Reporting Department Yesterday, Colonel Kamada Delivered an Impromptu Speech</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The eight major member newspapers of the Sino-Japanese Shanghai New Union Association hosted a banquet at noon yesterday in the meeting hall of the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association in the Waibaidu Bridge Xingya Building to bid farewell to Colonel Kamada, the outgoing department head of the Japanese Fleet Reporting Department, and to welcome Colonel Matsushima, the new department head. Colonel Matsushima, the new department head, was unfortunately unable to attend the banquet due to illness. Colonel Kamada, the outgoing department head, arrived on time, and the atmosphere was cheerful.</p>
<p>Hosting a Banquet</p>
<p>When the banquet was held, in addition to Colonel Kamada, the former department head of the Fleet Reporting Department, there were also Mr. Shiotani, Mr. Sakazume (trustee), Mr. Akahoshi (trustee) from the Army Reporting Department, Mr. Iwai (police officer) from the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, Vice Consul Fukuma, and other members of the New Union Association member newspapers and members of the three committees (editorial, business, and thrift), and directors of the consumer cooperative, including Mr. Osaka and Mr. Kojima from the Continental New Daily, Mr. Xu Liqiu and Mr. Yan Jiabao from the China Daily, Mr. Chen Binhe, Mr. Liu Hanru, and Mr. Xie Qu from the Shen Bao, Mr. Lu Guangjie and Mr. Shao Zhiju from the Ping Bao, Mr. Weng Yongqing, Mr. Wang Ping, and Mr. Peng Zhengguang from the New China Daily, Mr. Akamatsu and Mr. Hidaka from the New Shen Bao, Mr. Cheng Zhongquan and Mr. Pan Leshan from the News Daily, Mr. Zong Jingze, Mr. Xue Zhiying, and Mr. Rui Xinrong from the National News, and the association's director-general, Ren Yunpeng, totaling more than sixty people. First, Mr. Cheng Zhongquan of the News Daily, the monthly director of the association, delivered a speech on behalf of the entire body, stating: "Colonel Kamada has been serving as the department head of the fleet reporting department for more than three years, and the New Union Association has been established for eight months. Thanks to the guidance and assistance of the department head, our work has been able to proceed smoothly. Colonel Kamada has been in China for more than ten years, and he has deep connections in the press and cultural circles. Therefore, we have had a lot of cooperation in the past three years. We are reluctant to see him return to his country this time, and we hope that after the department head returns to his country, he will continue to assist the press in his country and the press in Shanghai. We wish the department head a bright future with this cup of wine."</p>
<p>Kamada's Speech of Thanks</p>
<p>Then, Department Head Kamada delivered a speech of thanks, stating: "This time, I have been ordered to return to my country, and Colonel Matsushima will succeed me. At this handover between the old and the new, I am very grateful for the great praise from all parties. Today, Colonel Matsushima is unfortunately indisposed and unable to attend, and has asked me to apologize on his behalf. During my tenure as department head of the reporting department, the Greater East Asia War broke out, followed by China's entry into the war, and the National Government took over the concessions. I was personally involved in these events. These events have great significance in world history, East Asian history, and the history of Shanghai. Therefore, I am greatly comforted that the importance of my work during this mission has been fully unfolded, and I am also very grateful for the close contact and assistance from everyone. Looking back, I came to Shanghai to serve as the department head of the reporting department. Over the years, I have received the assistance of everyone and the New Union Association, and I am deeply grateful. The New Union Association is an autonomous organization initiated and organized by the Sino-Japanese press in Shanghai. Since its establishment, it has made many contributions to the press. The press is a channel for transmitting information and has a difficult responsibility. This is a critical mission. At this time, the situation is becoming increasingly fierce, and the influence of Britain and the United States in East Asia has been completely eradicated. From now on, we must start from today and strive to work harder for East Asia, China, and ourselves. I hope that everyone will redouble their efforts and move forward. This time, I am leaving my post and returning to my country, and I hope that everyone will cooperate and give me your guidance. Thank you very much for your sincere invitation today. I wish everyone good health and the New Union Association a bright future."</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Property of Important Figures</h3>
<p>After King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed Mussolini and dissolved the Fascist Party, he appointed a committee to order the confiscation of the property of former Fascist Party leaders. The committee issued an official announcement on September 2, stating: "Italy has begun to confiscate the valuable property of former Fascist Party leaders. It has now been discovered that many former ministers, vice-ministers, and ambassadors have engaged in illegal accumulation of wealth... They have been prosecuted, and the confiscation of the property of former Foreign Minister Ciano and his wife is particularly strict. Most of their property has been confiscated, and the investigation of the remaining property is still ongoing."</p>
<p>Anyone who reads the above news must feel a sense of satisfaction! Especially the strict confiscation of the property of Mussolini's son-in-law and daughter, Ciano and his wife, can evoke a sense of pleasure in the reader. It shows that if one uses a belief, a country, or the people as a pretext, but in fact uses public office for private gain and amasses wealth, one cannot escape the eyes and ears of the people. When the situation changes and the party's power declines, those who benefited will scatter, and the ill-gotten gains must be returned. This is truly a kind of retribution.</p>
<p>The belief itself is not guilty, but the wrongdoing of those who implement the belief taints the belief. The belief itself is neither good nor bad, but the greed and selfishness of those who implement the belief makes the belief good or bad.</p>
<p>In fact, the most valuable thing about a belief is the belief itself, and the most valuable behavior in implementing a belief is integrity and having a personality. Otherwise, no matter what belief it is, it will not be bright, and the property of important figures becomes a stain on any belief!</p>

In the afternoon, it fell again, and all stocks had considerable declines. Trading was not bad. The Yong An Company of the department store industry fluctuated the most. It opened at a new high, but it was a flash in the pan, and it fell sharply. It was even weaker in the afternoon, and the final decline was slightly smaller than on the previous weekend. Xinxin and Guohuo moved together with small fluctuations. Lihua was flat alone. Chinese underwear also fell, and it was even more virtual in the afternoon. Guanghua Department Store hovered, and Jingfu socks were flat after falling. The textile industry's Yong An Textile had news of capital increase in the morning and jumped by more than one level in the buying trend, but it soon fell sharply, and the final decline was slightly greater than the previous day. Dasheng Factories 1, 2, and 3 were lackluster. Meiya and Xinhe each withdrew into the customs. Meilun wool fell into a premium of 1.5. Hehe, Dachina, and Hongsheng were also declining, and Sanyou Industrial could not revive. The new industry was also strong, and Zhongfa, Xinya, Xinyi, and Xinwu all saw small fluctuations. Wuzhou, Zhongsi, Science, and Chemical were all flat. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press rose slightly, Zhonghua and World rebounded slightly.

<p>Summary of Market Conditions</p>
<p>Government bonds were still unable to rise yesterday. Although many buyers were able to pull them up, they were still unable to suppress the enthusiasm of sellers, so there was a sign of reappearance. Most of it was also because although the environment was beneficial, funds were not convenient, so it was suppressed but not窜. However, if it is suppressed for too long, there will inevitably be a rebound. Yesterday, Class C was slightly higher, compared to last week's price, but after entering, supply still exceeded demand, the market situation was still sluggish, and finally declined, which was smaller than last week's rebound. Types A, B, D, and E have all entered the customs.</p>

<h3>Economic Office of District One Convenes Talks with Various Industries</h3>
<p>The Economic Office of the Shanghai Special City District One Public Office, in order to regulate prices and stabilize people's livelihood, decided to convene a discussion meeting with the heads of various industry associations starting tomorrow to exchange opinions on balancing prices. Tomorrow (8th) afternoon at 3:00 PM, the heads of the department store industry, Chinese and foreign department stores, and the leading food industry associations will be convened first to talk in the conference room of the District One Public Office. Discussions with other industries will be held regularly in succession, and the relevant offices will be notified separately in advance.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Establish New Trading Rules to Prevent Illegal Operations; Strictly Implement Supervision Work</h3>
<p>In the past, various industry associations have spared no effort in suppressing prices, establishing evaluation committees, and evaluating and limiting the prices of hundreds of goods. In order to prevent colleagues from being outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient, investigation teams were established, and investigation committees were appointed to conduct secret investigations in various stores and branches. On the other hand, they tried to dredge the materials needed by members, set up material distribution groups, and requested the authorities to assist in purchasing a large number of materials from various production areas and transporting them to Shanghai for distribution to member stores. The above measures have achieved considerable results in suppressing prices. Recently, various associations, in view of the intensified investigation work by the authorities, and since the implementation of the yarn and cloth purchase methods, other hoarders have released their hoarded goods. Various associations are deeply afraid that their member stores will be used by hoarders to engage in black market transactions, so they are supervising member stores more strictly. It was learned yesterday that various associations have also newly established trading rules and notified all members to know them.</p>
<p>Seven New Rules</p>
<p>Those who specialize in wholesale goods are limited to wholesaling existing goods to retailers in this industry. People outside the industry and merchants not in this industry are refused wholesale. Retailers should mark the price of each item sold and issue sales invoices. Various industries and markets must not engage in illegal buying and selling short. All spot transactions are limited to merchants in their own industry. If there is a shortage of goods, it is not allowed to hoard goods and profit by raising prices, changing grades, or engaging in other improper behaviors. All factories and stores must join the association. Non-members of the association may not engage in the sale and purchase of the relevant goods. , For items that have been evaluated and priced, whether wholesale or retail merchants must buy and sell in accordance with the evaluated price and must not deliberately violate it. If you want to change the price due to cost reasons, the association should forward it to the authorities for approval.</p>
<h3>Cotton Industry Association and Others Purchase Cotton</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) The cotton harvest in various parts of Central China this year is extremely abundant. Currently, the Cotton Industry Professional Committee and the Cotton Industry Association have drafted a purchase plan, and the estimated purchase quantity is 4 million dan.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Adjusts Exchange Rates in Various Regions</h3>
<p>In order to adjust inland funds and reduce the burden on merchants, the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank, in addition to entrusting the China Bank and the Bank of Communications to expand exchange services as much as possible, has specially adjusted the exchange rates for remittances in various regions. It has been implemented since September 1st. It is reported that the exchange rate has been reduced, especially the exchange rate in various parts of South China. For example, the exchange rate to Guangzhou was originally 20 yuan per thousand yuan, but now it has been reduced to 5 yuan. The exchange rate to Youdun Xiamen was originally 15 yuan, and the next reduction was to 4 yuan per thousand yuan. The exchange rate to Hankou, Jiangnan, Nanchang, Anqing, and other places was originally 10 yuan per thousand yuan, but now it has been reduced to 3 yuan. Anshun is 2 yuan, the original 5 yuan, and Nantong was originally 3 yuan, but now it has been reduced to 1.5 yuan, and the remaining exchange rates are also 1.5 yuan. As for telegraphic transfers, in addition to the established letter of credit and draft exchange rates, an additional telegram fee is charged: 80 yuan per item for Guangzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen, and 50 yuan for other regions.</p>
<h3>No Movement Permit Required for Silk Cocoons and Silk Fabrics</h3>
<p>According to a reporter's inquiry to the General Chamber of Commerce, regarding the movement of silk cocoons and silk fabrics within three provinces and two cities or within this city, in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on the Prohibition of Movement of Wartime Materials, it is not necessary to obtain permission from the General Chamber of Commerce, nor is it necessary to apply for a removal permit or movement permit.</p>
<h3>Authorities Thoroughly Investigate Eggs Exceeding the Limited Price</h3>
<p>The recent increase in egg prices in this city has attracted much attention from all parties. According to a reporter's investigation, the reason is actually that the new price list issued by the Transportation Industry Association on the 17th of last month seems to have the intention of taking advantage of the situation to obtain huge profits, and the excess limit price is too large. The Price Investigation Committee of this city believes that eggs are related to people's livelihood, and the source is constant, and it should not be increased again, so it has recently conducted a thorough investigation. It is heard that the Egg Industry Tongle Association has re-deliberated and set a new limit price, which is being submitted to the General Chamber of Commerce for approval, and it is expected that the egg price in this city will be suppressed within a few days.</p>
<h3>Chinese Communications and Other Banks Promote Acceptance Discount</h3>
<p>After the Silver Industry followed the methods established by the small group to promote the acceptance discount business, and ordered all banks and money houses to follow it, yesterday, it was learned that the China, Communications, Zhejiang Industrial, Shanghai, Xinhua, Damu, Guohua, and China Industrial Banks have taken the lead in promoting the acceptance discount business, and believe that factories and commercial houses use the discount of acceptance drafts to finance funds from banks, which is the most advanced way of borrowing. If various industries agree to promote acceptance drafts, please contact each bank directly. At the same time, each announced "This bank handles acceptance drafts and bill discount business." The regulations stipulate that after a commercial acceptance draft is accepted, the drawee or holder directly requests a discount from the bank. Fixed-term credit loans are handled using commercial promissory note discount methods. Ordinary collateral loans or overdrafts are handled by means of bank acceptance. The interest rate on acceptance discounts is determined to be lower than ordinary loans, and the procedures are simplified as much as possible, and various benefits are given to promote promotion. All bills for acceptance discount are allowed to be circulated among colleagues as a reserve, and if necessary, they may be submitted to the Central Reserve Bank for rediscount.</p>

<h3>How to Practice a New Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>— Hiata</p>
<p>This article is the gist of a speech given by Mr. Hiata, a renowned authority on friendly nation affairs, at the Shanghai Inland Water Transport Company. He pointed out that the reason why Japanese people are not respected by Chinese people in Shanghai is that they have forgotten the original nature of Japan. He concluded that practicing a new policy towards China must first eliminate the remnants of Anglo-American thought. Such a spirit of self-reliance is indeed admirable. (Translator's Note)</p>
<p>The Content of the New Policy</p>
<p>The phrase "new policy towards China" has been much talked about recently. What exactly is this new policy? How many people, even among the Japanese, can clearly grasp its substance? I think the number must be small. The so-called policy towards China up to now has not been very clear. Not to mention the general public, even the leaders are not clear about it. The general public listens to the guidance of these leaders they don't understand, so it becomes even more unclear. Thus, this unclear state of affairs has unfolded from the China Incident all the way to the Greater East Asia War. However, despite everyone's lack of thorough understanding, the direction taken has been generally good, which is truly a divine blessing and due to our rare group.</p>
<p>Returning to the main topic, the goal of this new policy towards China is quite consistent with the goal of Greater East Asia construction. The construction of Greater East Asia can be understood through the significance of the Greater East Asia War. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is consistent with the purpose of the China Incident, and the guidance of the Greater East Asian nations is consistent with the construction of China.</p>
<p>Establish Your Own Beliefs</p>
<p>The psychological state of those engaged in the construction of China today is very similar to that of people at the end of the Edo period. The vassals of the shogunate in the Meiji Restoration did not know what the situation would be like after the Restoration, but regardless of whether they knew or not, they all moved forward in the direction they should go.</p>
<p>When we ourselves feel confused, we should seek guidance from others, but what we should truly seek here is our own belief. Belief is by no means something that can be obtained by relying on others. In other words, one cannot create one's own belief using the power of others. One's own belief can only be obtained by relying on one's own conscience, that is, one's innate nature.</p>
<p>Remove Selfish Desires</p>
<p>Many people say that the Chinese are confused, but in fact, the Japanese, the leaders of this Greater East Asian nation, are also confused. Trying to lead the Chinese with confused Japanese people only leads to greater confusion. Many people are confined to the pursuit of their own selfish desires and want to establish another banner. The Japanese originally only needed one national flag, but they want to raise their own flag on top of that, and therefore are not respected by the Chinese. This is natural and not surprising. Japanese people find joy in practicing what is right, so they should practice it without hesitation or doubt.</p>
<p>For example, when it comes to the already implemented return of concessions, some Japanese people think that even if the concessions are returned, the Chinese people will not be very grateful. This should have been something to be happy about, but they are not joyful but worried. This is a shameful thing for the Japanese. The "imperialization and unification" of Asian nations is the unification that reveals their original essence, called "Shinshin no Michi," "Hakko Ichiu," giving full play to the abilities of the Japanese people, using the Yamato spirit, and moving forward bravely in both morality and military force. This time we have only done what we should have done. If the other party is happy, that is good, but if they are not happy, we don't need to be concerned. On the day when the shame of Greater East Asia, such as the existence of concessions, was eliminated, on the day when the concessions were returned on August 1st, few Japanese people in Shanghai raised the national flag to celebrate. This makes me feel truly sad.</p>
<p>Return to Original Nature</p>
<p>In short, the practice of the policy towards China is absolutely impossible if the Japanese people do not return to their original nature. I believe that if all Japanese people return to being true Japanese people, then the resolution of the China Incident will be possible. Taking the great heart of the Emperor as one's own heart and practicing it diligently, all problems can be easily solved. If one ignores this point and tries to promote things with one's own shallow thoughts, then even what can be solved cannot be solved.</p>
<p>Give Full Play to the Spirit of Musubi</p>
<p>Within the national policy companies, there are many Japanese people with the aforementioned mentality of wanting to raise another banner. The difference in treatment between Chinese and Japanese people, etc., are all issues that need to be given great consideration. Although perhaps they cannot be changed all at once due to various circumstances, they should be gradually changed, making Chinese employees aware of the meaning of moving from "dying together" to "living together," and in the workplace, Japanese and Chinese people should be closely connected, using the "spirit of Musubi" and the "Yamato spirit" to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>In short, the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere means organizing baojia within Greater East Asia. In today's era when Anglo-American thought has declined, its guiding spirit should be replaced by the "spirit of Musubi" that has been cherished since the founding of our country. Discriminatory treatment or exploitation, etc., needless to say, are following in the footsteps of Anglo-American so-called liberalism, especially the "commercial spirit," which has become a most corrupt habit in commercial cities. These have all reached the stage of reorganization.</p>
<p>Common Sacrifice Between China and Japan</p>
<p>Japan has shouldered the sacrifices in the Greater East Asia War, and at the same time, China should of course share its sacrifices, making all Chinese people happy to cooperate and share the burden. One must never use the Anglo-American idea of exploitation or employ deceptive tricks. Chinese people are far more astute than Japanese people, and Jewish people are even more adept at it, which Japanese people cannot match. Therefore, we must, by all means, sincerely use the spirit of Musubi and the Yamato spirit to influence them, and the issue of increasing productivity can also be solved with this spiritual power and put into practice.</p>
<p>I dare say that the practice of the new policy towards China should be to completely eliminate the remnants of Anglo-American thought in our own workplaces. I believe that if everyone thoroughly examines this in the workplace, they will naturally understand. This is my conclusion. (Translated in collaboration by Yiming Qun)</p>

<h3>Banning Smoking, Gambling, and Promoting New Entertainment</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ximing</p>
<p>Old smoking and gambling are wasteful and bad habits. To get rid of bad habits, one must plant good causes and conditions. By planting good causes and eliminating the evil of bad habits, the promotion of new entertainment becomes a great way to eliminate the root causes of smoking and gambling, creating a mutually reinforcing cycle. Many smoking addictions start because of unsanitary conditions and illness. Now, by using sanitary new entertainment to strengthen the body, eliminate diseases, and prevent the new causes of smoking, the old bad habits will inevitably be renewed and reduced. This physical education entertainment eliminates the toxins of smoking that cause illness. Gambling often arises from the desire for profit. Now, by using morally educational new entertainment to increase knowledge, enlighten talents, and guide the great path of generating wealth, greed will inevitably be reformed and reborn. This morally educational new entertainment eliminates the gambling caused by greed. If these efforts are carried out simultaneously, the old smoking and gambling and the new entertainment can be resolved at the same time, which will greatly please the people.</p>
<p>Arenas were originally a form of sports and social interaction. Now, changing dance halls into exercise fields is also consistent with the meaning. It is a pity that human nature tends towards evil, turning goodness into harm and oranges into tangerines, leaving behind regrets. Theaters originally told stories of filial piety and righteousness. Now, changing theaters into libraries is also the same principle, but it is regrettable that people's hearts are unpredictable, calling a deer a horse, painting a tiger but resembling a dog, and instead casting great mistakes. In summary, old evils must be eliminated, and new entertainment must be perfected, which can only be achieved when people's hearts are reformed.</p>

<h3>Accusation of Plagiarism</h3>
<p>(1) The article "The Chinese People and the Chinese Language" by Gou Sheng, published in the "National Discourse" on the morning of September 4, is found to be completely identical to the text "Youth and the Chinese Language" published in the first issue of the third volume of the China Cultural Service Agency in February 1940. The original author is Runren, but the word "youth" in the title has been changed to "Chinese people." This is to warn plagiarists. (Liaofan)</p>
<p>The article "Hatred" published in the 25th issue of Baimao is copied from a section of the American movie in the third collection of contemporary novels published by the Nongshen Zhouguo Society in January 1935. This is a special accusation. (Luo Changsheng)</p>
