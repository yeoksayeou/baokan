<p>社評</p>
<h3>粉碎英美外交戰的陰謀</h3>
<p>國際戰爭的形勢，一天天的向決戰階段邁進，在太平洋上受到了慘重打擊的英美，雖然天天嚷着向歐洲進攻，甚至於侈言太平洋的反攻，實際上却毫無力量，實行冒險。因此，他們的活動，仍不放鬆於政治外交方面。英美既以其傳統的狡猾的國際陰謀方針，不敢以正面作戰，而企圖用外交陰謀，來取巧獲勝。爲了他們自已的勝利，他們曾經不斷地犧牲他國的利益，犧牲盟邦的利益。第二次歐戰以前，曾經犧牲過捷克斯拉夫，戰爭以來，更曾犧牲法國，加拿大，印度，重慶和蘇聯的兵力，甚至在英美之間，彼此也時時刻刻在互相欺騙，互相規避。不久以前華盛頓的羅邱會談，以始終得不到史太林的信任參加而悄然閉慕了，結論之簡略恰與會談前之轟傳相反，充分顯示了反軸心國家間的暗影。正因爲如此，他們就一面誇大宣傳在某港某灣集中登陸艦艇，在某處某處移調大批軍隊以及空中惡戰等等的消息，另一方面却用政治外交的陰謀來代替軍事的攻勢。</p>
<p>英美政治與外交攻勢，我們可以看出，是集中在下列三點：第一是以太平洋反攻爲中心的對蘇外交陰謀，企圖以蘇聯出讓遠東地區供給英美作空軍根據地爲交換條件，然後在歐洲開闢第二戰綫。這本來是美國乃至重慶方面多年來夢想而未曾實現的企圖。美國之對蘇陰謀，一向爲各方注意，而且不斷有人向蘇聯提出警告，經過苦戰兩整年而實力大大消耗了的蘇聯，縱使愚笨到看不到美國這種貪慾的欺騙，事實上也決不可能在東方國境進行戰爭，替英美作貓脚爪。英美第一個外交陰謀，是不免要遭遇完全的失敗。第二就是以不惜冒險犧牲向歐洲開闢第二戰綫爲威脅，對歐洲各國展開政治工作。這種工作的主要方面，首先自然是放在土耳其和西班牙兩國的。遠在卡薩勃期加會談之後，邱吉爾即曾報聘土耳其，不久之前，英國中東方面軍總司令威爾遜，現在又有英國海軍上將克密漢之先後訪問土政府當局，不外爲威脅利誘，企圖土耳其允許反軸心軍科用土耳其的疆土及兵隊以進攻巴爾幹等地。其次，就是對西班牙之活動，有如六月十二日日本朝日新聞所指出的：「他們更想在西屬及法屬摩洛哥國境編組英美特殊軍，這軍隊的目的大概具有政治的意義，企圖用以推翻法朗哥將軍的獨裁，支持西班牙的自由民主主義運動，樹立由親英人士所組織的新政府或樹立王政，法屬摩洛哥目前正在集合西班牙的各反對黨編組民主主義義勇軍，也可看出這一傾向」。</p>
<p>除了對中立國的政治活動日益加劇之外，第三個陰謀，就是煽起歐洲軸心國軍事控制及政治統治地區的政治的變亂，他們所運用的最重要的工具就是「和平」的謠傳，企圖藉此製造所謂第二個第三個「達蘭」。製造出一連串的政治事變乃至煽起武裝暴動，藉以動搖人心及動搖軸心國家後方的秩序，有如本月十一日日本朝日新聞社論所指出的那樣。這種種陰謀，實際上都不過是英美當局因爲軍事上的軟弱而採取的卑鄙的活動而已，自然不會產生多大效果。不過，同時也不能不警惕到歐洲各小國，目前確已面臨極嚴重的危機，他們每一個國家，都得一面應付日趨兇惡與殘暴的轟炸，一面還必須加强國內戰綫的力量。目前，意大利已在最慘酷的試煉之下，有如意大利本土及地中海上大小島嶼所遭受的轟炸正在加劇，特別是從班泰雷利亞島失陷以後，空襲的殘暴性更挾着神經戰的兇具而向意國侵襲。但是，參戰恰已三年的意大利，正在與日本德國加强團結，人人抱着最後勝利的決心，不會在轟炸下有絲毫的動搖和分化的事件。我們相信，曾經創造了歐洲文藝復興的機運並且在世界民族解放鬥爭中久被羨讚的意大利人，一定不會在困難前在敵人面前動搖或低頭的。</p>
<p>敵人一切政治的外交的陰謀一定要失敗，阿根廷政變之演變漸趨對美不利，洪都拉斯反英美鬥爭之展開，伊期印度反英美運動的發展，北非季勞德與戴高樂所合組的法國民族委員會內部之迄未獲得澈底協調，乃至史太林對於美國利用遠東地區爲作戰基地之斷然的拒絕，都可說是英美整個政治外交陰謀失敗的開端。最重要的力量，足以給英美陰謀以決定性打擊的，是太平洋大小諸國之團結無間，軍事協力的淮展，生產建設之發達，有如本月十六日友邦東條首相在第八十二屆臨時議會開慕時所明白宣言的，我們要向打倒英美之途邁進，確立東亞民族解放運動必勝的基礎。我們東亞民族精誠團結，通力合作，同生共死的精神與實踐，必然可以刺激歐洲，作爲他們粉碎敵人陰謀的模範。在未來的決戰中，自然也將東方民族之團結無間而奠立最後勝利的基礎。但是，儘管如此，我們仍不能喚起東方民族注意，英美正在歐洲各地秘密活躍的政治陰謀，當然不能同時向東亞伸展其魔手，我們必須時時警惕，大家嚴肅緊張，加强團結，澈底粉碎敵人的神經攻勢與外交陰謀，揭發敵人在東亞的任何陰謀，加以迎頭痛擊，然後才會保證反英美的最後勝利。</p>

<p>馬尼刺二十日中央社電　菲島方面黑田陸軍指揮官，二十日正午設宴招待新菲島服務團代表百餘人，讚譽菲人之努力建設新菲島，並切望今後益加邁進，俾達目的。</p>
<p>新生服務團員超過六十萬人</p>
<p>馬尼刺二十日中央社電　菲島今已掙脫美西兩國四百年來之覊絆，而行將以大東亞共榮圈一幼子之地位，完成其光榮之獨立新生菲島，服務團這菲島復興東亞之精神之民族團體，自成立以來，迄今雖尙僅半年，但已展開積極之活動，本月十八日巳奉菲島日派遣軍之命組織委員會，而成這實現獨立之母體，其政治上之重要性，殊値注目。良以菲鳥服務團組織綱領，在使全島人民團結一致，積極協助日本軍政，而增進共同之福祉，換言之，其目標在使現在之社會，文化及經濟等各團體之活動及服務能力趨統一化，完全廓淸英美色彩，而培養東亞固有之美德，如誠實謹誠奉公勤勞及犧牲之精神，並提高體力使其恢復這健全之東亞民族。其組織規定，凡滿十八歲以上之男女均有入團資格，總裁由伐爾加斯長官擔任，現團員人數已超過六十萬人，該團員自成立以來，成這一思想文化團體，絲毫未涉政治色彩，依照軍政監前所提利於菲島實行獨立之原則，即積極協助軍政確保治安重編經濟，以謀當地之自給自足及恢復東亞精神，此在菲島服務團實這具體運動之指針。菲島服務團這改正依賴英美之錯誤觀念，恢復東亞人本來勢態，貫澈大東亞共榮圈之理念，自展開熱烈之啟蒙運動，高呼「菲島治安應由菲島人維持」以來，一般菲人均能自動協助日軍確保治安。此外，又在行政府內添設中央治安委員會，凡此對於治安之確立，均有莫大貢獻，至於重編經濟運動這完成糧食增產五年計劃起見，已動員團員之勞力，並參加收集糧食活動，曾於本年五月成立勞務人員訓練所，對勞務人員施以精神敎育涵養勤勞之美德，以外並設立農村團體等作積極之協助，又展開健民運動，添設體育設備，普及無綫電等，於公益事業亦巳大這振興，菲島服務團之活動，最近本已趨積極而益形具體，迨至東條首相躬親訪菲島後，菲人這求獨立之迅速實現，其情緒乃更激揚，而高呼「貢獻吾人之熱血」。綜上所述，吾人可知菲島服務團實已這新菲島國誕生之母體，其使命實至這重大，且已由過去之思想文化團體變而具有政治之性格。</p>
<h3>菲島感謝大會　伐爾加斯演說</h3>
<p>馬尼刺二十日中央社電　新菲島勤勞服務團主持之感謝獨立民衆大會，十九日下午五時在馬尼刺舉行。參加大會民衆不下三十萬人，盛况空前，軍政監及其他各部長均行出席，新菲島勤勞服務團總裁伐爾加斯等先後對大會羣衆演說，羣情異常興奮，後大會於歡騰聲中閉幕。</p>

<p>福岡二十日中央社電　日駐華大使谷正之氏，日前返國述職，頃因任務已畢，二十日上午搭飛機首途返任。</p>
<h3>日軍攻擊　渝方第五戰區戰果</h3>
<p>漢口日中央社電　渝（第五戰區）李宗仁所部這牽掣此次之日軍夏季攻勢，會在應城北方地區，積極反攻，然迭遭日軍痛擊，即倉皇向北方潰退，蓋日軍某部隊，於六月二日對在應城北方反攻之渝「第四十一軍百二十二師」進擊時，於京山東方十四公里之天王寺高地，將渝軍的三千人包圍擊漬，又於六月六日在應城西北三十二公里之仁和店附近，擊潰渝「第四十五軍第百二十七師」，迫其向北方山中潰走，後日軍雖行反轉，但仍隨時乘機反攻，故復於十三日拂曉在航空部隊協力下，自應城西北三十二公里之賈店仁和店及雷公店三方面，將渝軍包圍，更於十四日傍晚展開勇敢之殲滅戰，完全粉碎渝軍之企圖，該方面日軍所獲之戰果，這渝棄屍八五六具，被俘一七五人，日軍鹵獲迫擊砲三門，重機槍八挺，步槍一三二支，及其他輕機槍另件各種子彈藥品等甚夥。</p>
<p>廣州廿日中央社電　自龐炳勳孫殿英兩將軍參加和運後，渝方將領繼續來歸者日衆，此項事實，巳充分爆露渝方於喪失抗戰名目後，所處進退維谷窘境之眞相，渝電內部亦因此而大這衝動，參加和運之傾向，乃日漸顯著。渝方當局及將領間，因此亦互相猜疑及警戒，致渝軍內部情形異常混亂。據此間所接情報稱。川軍某師師長，因有反正嫌疑已被捕，又第七戰區之某將校，亦因致其同僚之信中而厭戰言辭而被處刑，此等事實，實這目前渝方內部混亂情况之確證。又據重慶電稱：渝軍委會後方勤務部長兪鵬飛，於十五日經寳鷄抵西安，至彼此行目的，似這調整關於冀察邊區軍潰滅後之運輸接濟，及其他後方　備事宜，及與各該地當局間協議善後方策者，但冀察邊區軍，因龐孫兩將軍等主要將領率部七萬參加和運後，在精神上已受重大之打擊，恢復已不可能，渝方刻雖極力企圖隱蔽事實眞相，以安定軍心，惟因渝方之抗戰名目已失，以及戰局不利等關係，其前途實不可容樂觀，終必將形成崩潰主要原因之一，實無疑義。</p>
<h3>美水利委長談　防水問題</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電　本年春季陰雨連綿，夏秋恐有水災這慮，建設部水利委長姜佐宣談，南京雨量，本年三月份這一百十餘公厘，四月份這一百公厘，五月份這一百三十餘公區，（去年五月份這一百七十餘公厘）較之過去三年，並未特多，再考南京長江水位，現時的這七公尺，尙不致較去年此時這高，本年淮水早漲，四月份即達十四公尺半，現且近十六公尺，雖已甚高，但尙能常如去年之例，則亦容有不致再高之希望。綜上所述，是本年淮水固高，江水亦不能云低，然尙無庸遽憂將有水災，要當以此後降雨情形及黃河來水爲判斷。惟天意雖不可測，而人力則不可不盡，故防汎工作，決不容疏忽，尤以在七八兩月內最這吃緊。建設部有鑒於此，早經擬具三省兩市防汎辦法大綱，呈院核准，分段施行該辦法大綱對防汎工作，採分序負責制：（一）首由中央訂頒辦法補助經費，負倡導之責，（二）次由地方政府厘定細則，實地分段，組織民衆，並加撥經費預購材料，負籌備之責，（三）汎至之時，由當地民衆除領用政府所備經費及材料外，再攤及本身財力，負日夜巡防及臨時搶險之責，庶幾政府無鞭長莫及之苦，民衆著這已奮鬥之功，官民合作，增大效率。</p>
<h3>廈門李市長　今向國府獻金</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電　厦門特別市李市長於日前晉京述職，幷恭謁主席致敬請訓，二十日下午李市長在中央飯店招待本京新聞界，報吿廈門市施政近况，及該市民衆這表示熱烈愛護國府起見，特向中央獻機一架，國防獻金十五萬元，巳定二十一日上午由李市長代表向國府呈獻。</p>

<p>南京二十日中央社電　保加利亞駐華公使斐利浦，前來華履新，於呈遞國書後，旋因公赴滬，頃悉斐氏巳在滬勾留完畢，業於昨日二十日由滬搭車過京赴津，外交部並派員往站照料，並悉斐氏抵津後，即將乘輪赴日。</p>
<h3>廣播會議華北代表　離京來滬觀光</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電　第二次東亞廣播會議，於本月十八十九兩日在首都舉行，集各地廣播事業專門家及負責人於一堂，交換對廣播事業推動之意見，結果極這圓滿。本次會議中華北政委會情報局特派黃凌雲大森正兩氏參加，於開會前二日抵京，會拜訪各面，黃氏服務華北新聞界多年，與京中新聞同業，大部這舊交，大森氏係事變後來華者，初服務新民會，旋轉任情報局，兩氏對於廣播事業均深有研究，本次聯絡會議中，貢獻頗多，現兩氏在京事務已吿一段落，業於（二十）日上午離京赴滬觀光，預定在滬逗留三天，轉赴杭州蘇州蕪湖等地考察，的於本月二十九日左右即行搭車返平。</p>

<h3>東京各報論述　鮑斯氏蒞日意義　義朝野對此表示歡迎　英關心鮑斯今後動向</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　印度獨立運動領袖江特拉鮑斯來日後，印度之前途頓充滿無限光明，此間各報二十日社論均以此爲題，加以評論。茲誌朝日新聞社論大意如次：印度獨立運動之前衛領袖江特拉鮑斯，此次突抵東京，爲爭取印度獨立而向世界呼籲，此對於全世界固爲一驚人之消息，同時實爲極大之喜訊，誠如鮑斯聲明中所言者，英人雖好高唱民族自決，並不斷謳歌民主主義及平等，然其對印政策則極盡暴虐及壓迫之能事。據此以觀，則英國實如氏所謂爲印度之「永遠敵人」。同時亦爲愛好永久和平及國民自由之世界各國家民族之仇敵。氏謂，軸心勝利後，則美國制霸世界之野心及英帝國必吿崩潰，印度因而獲得獨立良機，故軸心各國與印度間之聯繫實悉基於此種共通之利害。同時，日印兩國間之關係，因地理經濟政治各方面及其他各項重要條件，故具有特別緊密之關係，日本國民昔即衷心希望印度以獲得解放自由之立塲，使以印人建設印度之事能得實現，故於此對印度之偉大指導者鮑斯氏至表歡迎，且深悉氏對於以謀東亞永遠和平爲目標之大東亞建設所表示之努力與誠意，實具有充分之理解及協力之誠意，故衷心實至感愉快焉。</p>
<p>羅馬二十日中央社電　義國朝野聞印度獨立志士江特拉鮑斯安抵東京後，均一致表示歡迎，並祝福印度獨立運動前途光明。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十日中央社電　據倫敦電：英朝野對印度獨立巨頭江特拉鮑斯之訪問日本事，極爲重視，對該氏今後之動向，亦極爲關心，路透社並會接日本放送事實作同樣之報道，而未加任何批評。</p>
<p>德國民間引起反響</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　昨日德國各報均刊載鮑斯到達東京之消息，德意志普報著論云：此印度領袖之抵日，實爲重要政治因素，渠自德國前往日本，可爲軸心國密切合作之明證。各報皆希望印度民衆能在鮑斯之領導下獲到獨立。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　印度獨立運動志士江特拉鮑斯氏，此次來訪日本，於德國民間引起一大反響，「德外交通訊社」對此論述稱　當鮑斯氏啓程離歐之際，吾人雖不勝惜別，然因彼歸還東洋，實具有正當之理由，不便阻攔，日本軍於東南亞細亞收獲之赫赫戰果，已予印度獨立運動一新時機，爲利用此絕好之機會，着手進口重要之任務，鮑斯氏之歸返東亞，實爲至善。東條首相於最近之演說中，曾反復申言爲使印度脫離英國之桎梏，日本將準備以各種援助，又日本對大東亞共榮　諸民族之態度，已爲印度民衆所深切了解．又鮑斯氏得以自印度到歐洲，而此次又自歐洲到日本，此足以對印度民衆表示盎格魯薩克遜早已非世界之支配者，故於精神上之影響亦甚大。而同峙印度民衆爲求解放，已發現自已之力量，依此視之，印度之獨立運動定能急速進展，且於如是愛圃之鮑斯跳領導下，印度不久即能獲得　自由，當可無疑。</p>
<h3>鮑斯在印地位</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　現代印度之指　者，除甘地占有待殊崇高之地位外、其次當推江符拉鮑斯及尼赫魯，彼等同爲「戰鬥印度」中之最英勇鬥士　而江特拉鮑斯在政治上之立塲尤爲卓特。蓋尼赫魯雖與鮑斯同屬於國民會議派中之急進派而首稱「社會主義者』，但渠於實踐方面則仍悉以甘地爲楷模，至於江特拉鮑斯其崇敬與讀仰甘地亦絕不後人，且爲印度國內可直接評論甘地之一人。渠嘗讚楊甘地之事業，今日之國民會議派大部爲甘地所創造，會議派之組識即爲甘地之事業，渠且使會議派自單純之議論團體立塲進而變爲鬥爭之機關。當一九一九—二〇年時，印度獨立鬥爭方式中之立憲主義已趨消沉，暴力主義將代之而起，其時。衆羣起尋求新鬥爭方法，需要新領袖，甘地乃應時而起，領導大衆，故鮑斯曾譽甘地爲，印度運命之子」，及至一九三五年，鮑斯曾推測甘地未來之鬥爭謂，將來富英政府以强力加諸印度之時，甘地能否保持其在政治上之固有立塲，將視渠能否採取更急進之政策而決定，設渠於其時能　然獻身於急進之鬥爭工作，則恐任何人不能阻遇，余認爲其時於印度　爭在階段中領導印人鬥爭之英雄。在印度鬥爭之下一階段中，必仍爲領　印人鬥爭之英雄。自大東亞戰事爆發後、甘地　果如　斯黃日所言　起　導反英運動，爲覆減壓迫印度之「有秩序之無政府狀態」起　，終至發起武力暴動，鮑斯對此實至感欣快，目前鮑斯正循甘地所開拓之鬥爭大道而努力。鮑斯之政治信條　爲朗確。　認爲謀印度政治獨立，實爲復興印度、解放印度民族之大前提，爲達目的，必須採取一切手段、從事鬥爭。故渠主張謂：「吾人應毋忘以暴力政策敎印人者，實爲英人，吾人對於英人，應以其人之道還治其人之身」。故渠堅決主張爲爭取印度獨立，應立即發動武力革命、吾人於此即可窺知鮑斯所以能自困難環境中展開「前衛派　運動者，實因渠具有熱情及組纔力，足以把拼羣衆。鮑斯在此點上實較甘地尤爲前進。渠之强烈信條爲「不奮鬥即無榮譽』，此言實可視爲渠之座右銘，事實七　亦　爲英　之鬥士、爲希自血腥之戰塲中以爭取印度獨立之　　。故　實爲甘地之後繼者，　不僅爲甘　之忠實信從，且爲具有　甘　　　究成印度獨立之熱情與鬥忠之英雄，足可爲現代印度鬥士中之代表人物，此爲甘地及印度民衆亦深悉者。大　亞戰爭爆發以　，印度民衆悉　，鮑斯爲「保衛印度者」而急盼渠自德　來，領導印度獨立運動，去年五月曾盛傳鮑斯於柏林因乘機失事不幸殞命，印人莫不大驚失色。全印各地並紛　　旗罷市，以誌哀悼，其時甘地且曾對鮑斯之　　謂：「印度失一巨星」，但未幾知此項消息爲英國所揑造、鮑斯之吼聲自柏林傳至印度，印人於此瞬間始再重燃其費日之希望，全印欣喜若狂，紛揭印度獨立之旗，大畢慶祝，使英當局極感狼狽，而甘地亦復公開向鮑斯之母致詞道賀。總之　今日之江特拉鮑斯，其一身之安危，寳足以左右全印民衆之心情』故渠寳已成爲全印民衆崇拜之偉人，而爲印度瑪哈特瑪（偉大之靈魂之意）之繼承者。</p>
<h3>奧萊爾及威里休區　發生猛烈陣地戰　庫班蘇軍進攻又受創　其戰鬥精神顯已大減</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十日中央社電　據東綫消息，庫班地區蘇軍曾於十八日晚突然再取攻勢，在有力之砲兵及空軍掩獲下，進攻德軍堡壘，但被德軍擊退，受創綦重，此外，奧萊爾地區及威里休地區十八日亦發生熾烈之陣地戰，允奧萊爾突出陣地之攻防戰，速日畫夜激戰不已，現巴漸吿擴大。另息，蘇軍在奧萊爾西北三十公里之姆資安斯克地區再行反攻，德。蘇兩軍刻正在死鬥中，觀此情勢，東綫戰事將以庫彭，奧萊爾及威里休主要戰區爲中心，而漸發展爲全綫之大作職，衆認此已暗示本年夏季作戰之性質殊堪注目。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德國新聞社昨晚獲悉，蘇軍於屋期五會以强大之部隊教次向庫班橋頭堡之德軍陣地作局部攻擊，但並無仟何成就，蘇步兵隊雖使用强大之砲隊及戰鬥機隊，但並未能突入德軍防綫，在各處地點皆被擊退，蘇軍除陣亡數百人外，又被俘二百四十八人。庫班下游地區之戰鬥，至今已達兩月，蘇軍僅獲得少量之補充，其戰鬥精神顯已大减，據被俘　稱：該地區蘇軍之糧食及其他供應已大减，因此士氣亦萎麼不振。在其他前綫地區僅有小規模之戰鬥，尤以奧萊爾前綫之東北部地區及維立許之東爲允甚，各處蘇突擊隊之前進，皆被阻於德軍前方陣地。德國新聞社空軍代表佛萊太格少校稱：德空軍於星期五繼續對蘇方之鐵道及公路，作有計劃之襲擊，頗著成效，蘇方軍事工業設備亦於星期五晚被襲擊，德機又在伏爾加河口擊沉滿載之貨船兩艘，共計一萬一千噸，又重創貨船兩艘，共計八千噸。俯衝轟炸機一隊，在列寗格勒之南擊毀蘇方之鐵路鐵橋一座，蘇戰鬥機企圖阻止德機，亦遭德戰鬥機截擊，擊落蘇機三十一架，德機並無損失，是期五蘇方共損失飛機四十五架，德機亦有兩架米飛回。</p>
<h3>華維爾任總督　印度民衆不滿</h3>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　據孟買消息，馬德拉斯印度報，昨對華維爾元帥之被委爲印度總督，表示惋惜，該報稱：「印度之民衆在現時之情緒下，必反對此項任命，認爲乃係證明邱吉爾仍反對印人之企望」。</p>
<p>北京通信</p>
<h3>端午在北京</h3>
<p>— 學子</p>
<p>續齊諧記稱：「屈原以五月五日沉江死，楚人哀之，以竹簡貯米投水，裏以棟葉，纏以綵縷，使不爲蛟龍所吞。」端午之爲紀念人詩人自殺之節日至少是傳說中所承認的事實？根據傳統的風俗，。一天不但是如風土記之所云：「烹驚角黍，」還有龍舟競渡，挿蒲艾，欽雄黃酒，貼驅毒符，栩香囊等等。龍舟競渡，隋書地瑰志云，係「屈原以五月望日赴汨羅，土人追至洞庭不見，湖大船小，莫得濟者，乃歌曰：「何由得渡湖？』因爾鼓櫂爭歸。競會亭上，習以相傳，以爲競渡之戲。」然而，荊楚歲時國引曹娥碑云：「五月五日，時迎伍君，逆濤而上，爲水所淹，」則是吳中風俗，事關伍子胥，和屈原毫無關係，荊楚歲時記又引越地傅，謂係起於越王勾踐。這樣說起來，龍舟競渡，甚至於節日的水身是否與屈原有絕對的關係，就不能和北京大學敎授趙蔭棠先生端午日在北京中央廣擴電台說的那樣準確了。可是這並不是重要的問題，反正一個節日紀念，總有其社會的原因在，而世俗的沿習又往往會參入其他的成分。端午的縣藩挿艾，門貼驅毒符，明明是後來的新加成分。明朝京師吏民每逢端午，必結遊天壇，舉行賽馬，穿起艾衣蒲鞋，不只是在再上懸挿幾根蒲艾而已，而遼代的帝王且以端午日所採的艾葉興棉花相和而綴成的衣服穿在身上，大出其時髦的風頭。至於福毒符則與張天師驅逐五毒的辦話有關。去年端午節北京中央電合還有人用淸脆嬌嫩的腔調對小孩子們廣播張天師如何到北京驅逐五毒的故事。這些却興三閭大夫的投江故事毫無關係了。</p>
<p>端午的來源我們不必細加追究，但這一節日之爲中國民間所紀念的一個大節則　不成問題的</p>
<p>如果端午節是起源於屈原的話，則這位失意詩人總算是在他的投江一死衷出了一口大氣。他的自殺是給窮人們建築了一座鬼門關，多少的窮人是因爲無法過此節關，而和屈原採了同一的步驟。但是在另一方面，他又給寶　豪家，風流詩人造下了許多享盡人生樂趣的機會。這樣作威作語的權力恐怕是人問的任何帝王都做不到的。屈原的陰靈應該是十二萬分滿意的了。</p>
<p>然而，因爲一般經濟的破產，除了這座鬼門關是越來越堅以外，端午節已經不能再給人們多少享樂的機會了。十餘年前我們還可以看得到一年不如一年的龍舟競渡的盛况，現在這種習俗差不多是到處都隨着破損而無力修補的船板一同沉沒在江河的最深處。就是在這舊日帝部所在的北京，年紀稍爲輕一點的人們就連龍舟是什麼樣子，也沒有法子想像出來。</p>
<p>去年的端午過得就夠　意思。今年是北京食的問題最是恐慌的時節，然而端午却過得沒有一般人所想像的那樣的蕭條。三星期之前，政府就在第四次配給之中特別爲端午節每人多配給了兩斤麵。因爲報紙上說得太含忽，一般人都以爲是在第四次配給以外還有特別的端午配給，一直等到端午之前兩天，報紙上再來一個聲明，這才冰然若釋了。然而爲了這兩斤的端午配給確是熱鬧了不少的時間。因爲節關的關係，或是政府嚴勵實行公定價格的影響，都說不定，端午之前幾天，糧食居然是落了一些價，雖然每斤米只由三元二角落到三元，可是也給人不少的興警。最惹人注意的是報紙上登有北京市政府和新民會總脅要於端午日上午十時舉行「龍舟競渡」的籌劃，而該日下午北海和中央公園又將分別舉行市民賽艇和市民同樂會的消息。娛樂的廣告上也居然有張君秋將於端午日演應節戲「混元盒」的報這。這似乎都可以使人有「過節」的感覺。</p>
<p>端午節的前兩天，朱委員長又特別給所屬出了一張通知，說是適値戰爭時期應常免除一切稱賀虛文，然而「節」的味道所以能夠在那幾天聞出來，却正是因爲這虛文所在的街上所見的一大包一大包的送節禮品。然而這畢竟是少數，一般中等的人家是連幾個棕子也捨不得買的，而東西四牌樓菜市上的公開搶食也給端午節點綴了不小的熱鬧。</p>
<p>端午是到了。於是一羣一羣的男女靑年也就抱着莫大的希望去參默這宣傳已久的龍舟競渡。北海公園的遊人雖然還不及十年前一個平常星期日的人多，然而也總算是不少了。其中居然也還有兩位妙齡少女胸前掛着兩顆香　子，令人囘想昔年的盛况，而興起無限的惑想。然而太液波上却找不到龍舟的踪跡。五龍享上結着不少的花綵，多少可以聞出一些節的氣味。一直等到十一點半，在　眼欲穿的當中，忽然聽到吹笛的聲音。於是，在一陣「來了」的叫聲裏，從五龍亭那邊就慢呑吞的爬出了幾條小艇。原來所謂龍舟競渡者就是這些「羣舟無能」的摩登小艇的比賽。每艇有這麼三個兩個的划手，就是有牛大的勁兒也無法把船划得怎樣的快。這和七十幾個划手隨着暄天的鑼鼓一起一落的飛也似的鬥着龍頭龍尾的快舟比，簡是小巫見大巫了。近世的宣傳多半是這一類的。</p>
<p>下午在中央公園新修的音樂堂裏還舉行了市民同樂會，其中的節目有相聲，有　子，有京戲等。然而天氣太熱，頗有一點殺風景。而在北海方面，市民的划船此賽也依原定的計劃進行着。</p>
<p>可是出了這兩個公園，節的氣時就漠薄　來。言蒲和艾子的踪跡是無論如何也找不到了。而晚來街頭到處的要飯聲又把這「同樂」後的市民添上了一層灰色的情緒。</p>
<p>戰時的端午節就算是這樣的過去了。（端節夜）</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>潮汕災荒也値重視</h3>
<p>潮汕各屬，今歲也岡皐災，災區雖無華北之大，而災情也有同樣之苦，我們居於同　的地位，常然無所厚此薄彼。</p>
<p>關於潮汕災况，我們也曾接到過若干報道，中間以强樑　然李訓庭諸君潮汕同鄕的報吿最爲眞切，如「今春以來，久旱不雨，田野盡赤，糙米每斗售價達五百餘元，山薯每斤十餘元，亦不易購得，小康之家，面有菜色，貧苦大衆餓斃累累，虎疫猖獗，生老亦不保夕。」總而言之，滿紙悽楚，不忍卒讀</p>
<p>我們知道潮汕同鄉，旅滬經商，積資殷富者，頗不乏人，其次廣東同鄉，亦佔工商界重要地位，我們首先盼望潮汕人士以及廣東人士，在同鄉地位，加倍出力，我們並不是主張地域觀念，當然同時希望各界一致捐助。不過有實　的潮汕人，實應居倡導與率先地位，也是義所應常的事。</p>
<p>本報社會服務處，早已代收潮汕災捐，截止目前止已有一萬餘元，此後自當繼續代辦，以盡一分子責任。</p>
<h3>日文化振興會主催　中日書畫座談紀錄</h3>
<p>日本國際文化振興會，日前茶會招待本市書畫家馬公愚。在亞塵·王季遷·熊松泉·房虎卿·鄭午昌·王季眉·吳湖帆等舉行座談會，即席均發表意見，摘述如下：　吳湖帆　此次日本在滬舉行盡展，爲期甚促，若中國把作品介紹到日本舉行短期的　覽會，其效果一定很少，故需有一組織藉供長期研究，方能獲得較好的效果、</p>
<p>王季眉　希望國際文化振興會能出而拉攏中日書畫家長時研究，使東亞的文化，得有進展，則將來再開展覽會時，其成績自將更臻斐然。</p>
<p>王季遷　希望將來對中國寫意的畫，能多多介紹到日本，而日本把西洋畫的技巧，也不妨介紹到中國。</p>
<p>王亞塵　繪書藝是有感覺有美觀的，中國畫在近五年來，每一畫家以時局的關係，都特別打起精神埋首研習，但這不是政治力量，要是畫是以政治背景來推動提倡的話，是沒有成效的。</p>
<h3>響應「節省宴會公約」（第十一回）</h3>

<h3>爲華北急賬貢獻另一籌款辦法</h3>
<p>— 狄繼堂</p>
<p>此次華北災情儼重，哀鴻邇野，餓殍載途、傷心怵目、慘不忍聞。惻隱之心，人皆有之、凡屬人類，能無動心　本市之捐款籌賬者。既有申報提倡於前、現在復有各界熱心人士組織急賬會、本悲天憫人之心，抱居安思危之意，將來　集巨款，加惠災黎，自非淺鮮。惟是災區遂闊、災民衆多、雖有各界人士踴躍捐輸、猶恐杯水車薪。難以普遍。是以對於　款，亟宜多方　措、除捐款及舉辦球賽遊藝會書畫　　會等等之外、如有可能方法、自應同時舉行、總期賬款多多益普、俾得普惠災黎，是用不揣愚陋、將管見所及，貢獻於辦賬諸公、以作義集賬款之補充辦法，亦愚者一得之意耳。</p>
<p>按前歲哈同夫人羅迦陵女士去世，其遺囑中有一項曰：</p>
<p>「余給付一百萬元之財產（依照一九三七年工部局估價）於中國政府、以充增進公衆福利之經費。</p>
<p>上項財產、照一九三七年估價一百萬元。則現時市價當在千萬元以上。羅氏之產、雖屬敵產、但上項指定部份、既已指給中國政府，作增進公衆福利之經費，自可提出於敵產範圍之外，交中國政府移充此次華北賑災之需、想友邦當局必樂予贊同。倘能商得同意，允予移撥，即可由我政府委托急賬會分別標賣。値此非常時期，證之上海近年市况，購置地產者多，則立集巨款，自非難事，以之辦賬，常較零星招募爲有把握矣。至於如何向當道商請、以及手續應如何辦理，是在辦　諸君子商討而善行之。想我政府諸公，社會碩彥。倘亦以鄙言爲可採乎？災民幸甚！</p>
<h3>提倡一日所得助振運動</h3>
<p>— 張一冲</p>
<p>無論救災賬款。必須羣　羣力，本救人救己精神，努力輸將。自華北急賬會成立後，一切救濟辦法。均在積極推行中。本產市民捐款已有成數，惟以華北災區撩擴，災民衆多，而上海捐款總數截止目前止、尙不及二百萬元、如按分配、每個災民所得恐爲數極有限。</p>
<p>爲擴大賬災捐欽運動，仍須本過去精神、策動全市民衆努力輸將，以　危急，救災如救火，必須迅速、茲建議提偶一日所得助賬運　，無論公司，行號，商店，銀行，教育，勞動工人，自由戰　，戲院，娛樂場，以及其他工商各界團體或個人均可參加，以一日營業之所得，或一日酬勞之所得，全部捐作賬災款項，在商人固所樂爲，在個人亦屬輕而易舉之事。望新聞界全力發動，擴大宣傳，爲華北災民再度請命，寶深盼禱焉。（移酬助賑）</p>

<p>平分秋色</p>
<p>滬速埠際（田徑對抗）首先開始，首爲千五百米決賽，大連　口希望較濃、以快步一路佔先，上海久保田亦不示弱，在後　隨，至最後四分之一行程，猛穿於前，結果將至終點時瀨口不捨直直衝剌，榮獲冠軍。（撑竿跳）大連希　最優。結果果爲阿部城戶二人包辦，（百米）大連福田十一秒一之成績已與平日紀錄迫近，上海木村亦屬非凡，競爭熱烈，結果以點一之差而退。（鉛球）本可爲大連所勝，上海德選手派克及華烈柴二人與之力爭派克以十一米八五取得首席，大連加藤遂爲所屈。（跳遠）大連福田保持七米，昨突破紀錄爲七米十八。（四百米）上海久保田，經積極猛習，銳不可當，昨以五十二秒七，打破保持五十三秒之大連瀨口，該隊四本亦告不弱，以同一時問。與久保田對衡，惜落一肩吿退（鐵餅）一項，以保持三十二米之大述福田，昨乃成績退化，加藤以三十五米二八取勝，上海山本仍保持以前紀錄，日著名上海隊木村果名不虛傳，結果以一米八五獨佔鰲　，與平時紀錄僅差點五。至（五千米長跑）滬華老將王正林，本有亞軍希望，礙於大連瀨口所阻起步，王將一度穿出瀨口領頭，嗣爲瀨之快步穿出，王即退後，中途又爲上海阿部及富永所追上最後衝　，得獲第三，王之步伐平勻及猛銜姿態。獲得滿塲采聲。（標槍）滬華將王學武之技能、難能可貴，益顯不凡，姿勢之美妙，更爲全塲所矚目，昨突破大述加藤城戶，以五二米九輕取首席。（上海田徑）二項總分，初時以一分之差暫屈，其後於跳高平添四分　可望穩取，滬在四百米接力爲大連所勝，共加三分，打成五二對五二平手。茲將總分數探錄如：</p>

<p>足球滬勝</p>
<p>下午五時半滬連足球對抗賽於廣塲中央揭幕，滬隊集中日西精銳大將，勝利已在預料中。然大連全體將員實力亦不柔弱。末可小視。祗因聯絡技術較欠，與滬隊各將之各有所長、是乃最大之致命打擊。雙方守門，滬羅蒂與連魏中華確是可兒、以職責所在，力敘險球，門禁戒衛相當森嚴。大述因全陣調戊離山，故魏門孤掌難鳴，造成一面倒之勢。滬隊華將孫錦順戴麟經吳祺祥買幼良韓龍海瞿永福等大爲活躍，日將四田義將維拉羅西爾亦此起彼落，身先擋前。初賽時，雙方反復攻門，狀頗緊張。二十五分鐘後，維拉首開記錄於三十碼處，踢中綱心，一對〇。大連失球未及五分鐘，吳祺祥挿翅而入以頭頂進又勝一球、旋爲戴麟經迪盤那，連續中的。上半時四對〇，上海大勝。檸檬後雙方互易陣地興兵再起，孫錦順大步直衝，攻進一球。朱幾，瞿永福又在三十碼打門得中，成爲六對〇，一時大連方面大起恐惶，經拚力反攻，爲譚學銘所中　破鴨蛋，扳囘一局。於後滬隊迪盤那再進一局，下半時計爲三對一。全塲吿終，上海隊以七對一高凱奏歌。</p>

<h3>母親</h3>
<p>— 李學平</p>
<p>是一個靜悄悄的秋夜，沒有月亮，窗外一片漆黑得可怕，馬路上的聲音早已沈寂了，只有遠處教堂的鐘給西風振盪着傳來一陣陣的鐘聲。</p>
<p>小牀上躺着一個三四歲的小孩，在暗淡的燈光下可以看到他那張非常瘦削的靑灰色的臉，時時顫動的眉頭顯出他身上的痛苦，沒力氣的呼吸，或張或閉無神的眼睛表示他已病了好幾天。</p>
<p>母親帶着憂　的臉，斜坐在床沿上，幾天幾夜的辛勞憂慮使她的眼眶陷了進去，面孔現出了憔悴的黃色。她愁苦地望着床上止和痛苦爭鬥的小生命，當他不時發出苦楚的　聲時，如靈魂好像受到了殘酷的撕裂。她眼看着這小小的生命在病魔的手掌裏掙扎，在受着酷刑；她覺到千萬顆子彈射進了她的心臟，千萬頭野默在支解着她的肢體。但她寗願給千萬顆子彈射中，給千萬頭野獸支解，不願看這幼小的靈魂受病魔無情的蹂躪。</p>
<p>孩子的呻吟突然加重了，雙目現出了直光，嘴角痛苦地扭了下去，兩手不住地抖動。母親驚慌得呌喊一聲，瘋在似的將他抱了起來。這時在大床上輾轉的父親立刻躍了起來，</p>
<p>「孩子怎麼了？」</p>
<p>「不…好，快拿藥」母親聲音顫動得很利害。</p>
<p>父親很快的到桌上拿了藥，又倒了一杯開水。</p>
<p>小孩的知覺差不多沒有了，母親一面喂着藥，一面眼睛裏現出了水在在的兩點。</p>
<p>小孩吃下了藥似乎好了許多，呻吟聲止了，臉上也减去了痛苦的表現，很安靜地躺在母親的壞裏。</p>
<p>「醫生說今晚是最危險的時候，過了便可無事，但是恐怕…」母親喉嚨梗住了。</p>
<p>「我想不至於吧，現在他已很好了，你太辛苦，也該休息一刻，讓我來看他吧」父親看有母親焦黃疲乏的臉，實在過意不去。</p>
<p>「不，不，你自已睡吧，明天還得上寫字問，孩子如果不好了我再喊你。</p>
<p>「你已好幾夜沒有睡了，你看你的而孔，你也得當心自已」</p>
<p>「不，不，我不……要緊，他現在安靜了點，就讓他安定一會」</p>
<p>孩子在母親的懷裏，一半靠藥力的幫助，一半爲了舒適，不久便睡着了。</p>
<p>秋天的深夜是格　外凄凉可怕，嘖嘖的虫聲像荒山怨鬼的哀鳴。一陣陣凄風吹得窗戶格格的響，像魔鬼在敲門。樹葉震動的聲音，夾着一兩陳遠處傳來的犬吠，和那敎堂的鐘聲，織成一首悲凉的交響曲。</p>
<p>父親爲了白天的辛苦已睡着了，那邊床上的兩個姊姊也睡得正濃，母親抱着小孩呆呆地坐在床沿上，只有對面牆上的鐘，的答的答走着好像是她唯一的伴侶，然而它也是她的宰判，她的全部希望寄托者，只要它的針多走一分，便是小孩的危險期减少一分，也就是她的憂慮除去一分。</p>
<p>當小孩面孔有着苦楚的表示時，她便彷彿看到死神在向她露着得意的笑，她戰慄着緊緊抱住這可憐的小生命，一面不斷的默禱，懇祈上天准她自己受無論任何犧性去換得這小生命的安全。她一直抱着小孩，不敢放下，一面爲了怕他不安適，一面爲了心中有一陣莫名的恐怖，好像他一離開她的懷裏就要給人奪去，永遠再不囘來了。</p>
<p>時鐘好像沒有理眯她的祈求，走得特別的慢；束方的太陽也好像沒有聽見她的禮吿，遲遲不露出身子來。但小孩的情形却很良好，除了幾次要喝水以外，一直很平靜的睡着。母親心裏稍感一點快慰，但同時也覺到一陣不可抑制的疲倦。一連幾天的全夜辛苦削剝盡她全部的精神。但抱着小孩常然不好睡覺，而且也小敢睡覺，她想她睡了，小孩便立刻會給死神搶去。只好勉强撑起了酸麻的腰，張大了無力的眼，一分鐘一分鐘地不知支持了多少時候。終於她覺得眼前漸漸變做漆黑，全身好像灰塵般的散開，屋子裏的東西都昏暗起來。忽然她見到小孩的病已經好了，像平時一樣的天眞活潑，在屋子裏跑來跑去。她正在欣喜欲在的時候，窗外突然伸進一隻魔手，向小孩子抓來。母親大驚愈忙把小孩抱住不放。醒覺原來是一塲夢。小孩子仍舊很安靜地睡在母親懷裏，束方也已　略略現出了一片灰白顏色。</p>
<p>「感謝蒼天，保佑孩子平安過了這一夜。」母親看看東方灰白的天空，又看看孩了的小臉，幾乎湧出了眼淚。</p>
<p>隨着窗口映　來的晨囑，她看了看床　甜睡的丈夫，瘦黑的臉上刻着全家負担和兒女病痛　賜與的皺紋。她又看了看那邊兩個女兒，正在留戀着美麗的夢境。牛乳色的手臂壓在烏黑的　髮下面。合着的眼睛下印着粉紅的頰，倍覺得天眞可愛。她也看到自己枯瘦的手。給小孩吸得　下去的乳房，那裏是自己的靑春？那裏是少女時代的肥嫩的纖手？圓滿的乳峯？苗條約身段？曾小心地用手帕遮過陽光的嫩頰？她記起了昨晚丈夫對她說的話。</p>
<p>「你太辛苦，也該休息一刻。」</p>
<p>「你看你的面孔，你也得當心自已，」</p>
<p>她心中感到一陣痛苦，但立刻便消失了。陽光已經透進了窗帷映到兩個女兒蘋果似的面孔，和病孩非常安靜露着快適微笑的臉。</p>
<p>「是，爲了他們，我自已是不要緊的。」母親覺到無上的安慰。</p>
<h3>論「新文藝」底創作者</h3>
<p>— 征原</p>
<p>最近在「雜誌」上登載了幾篇討論「新文藝」問題的文章，對於目前一般「新文藝」底創作，就其內容與形式。筆法與腔調，各各加以透澈的檢討和批判，貢獻了許多寳貴的見解。不過他們所談的，都不外是幾個創作上的枝節細目，至於「新文藝」底創作者的本身，則尙未曾論到；現在就將管見所及，略爲一談。</p>
<p>大凡一篇優秀作品的產生—無論是屬於「新文藝」或「舊文學」底範疇——必需要有實際經騐作爲後盾；嚮壁虛搆，一無基架，大概不會寫出好文章的、據說趙子昂盡馬之前，關起門來，俯仰跳騰，先做了許多馬底動作姿態，纔能畫出神采生動的馬來；左拉爲了要寫工人的生活，自己就到工人羣裏去經歷了一番；「日出」的作者曹禺，因爲要寫妓院的內情，聽說也到八大胡同逛上個把月。由此可知，必要有眞實的感印，纔能寫出內容充實的作品來。</p>
<p>反顧目前許多「新文藝」底創作者，他們整天深居象牙塔中——更確切些不如說鴿籠式的亭子間中——生活空虛，經騐貧乏，不要說劃時代的巨著，就連稍爲含義豐富，眞切反映人生的文章都寫不出；於是誠如哲非先生所說的，只能毫無來由的空嚷着甚麼「紫丁香花的夢呵」，「夜鶯哀歌的煩惱呀」，「百合花的潔白啦」，而所形容的對象，祇不過是舞女的嘴脣，歌女的喉嚨，虛無的情人而已。至於紫丁香，夜鶯，百合花，恐怕他連做夢也沒有見過是怎麼樣子的。</p>
<p>也許有人要嘆息說，我們何嘗不想寫些內容較有意義，觀點較爲積極的文章，可是不能不顧及此時此地的環境呀。其實，這種理由是極不充分的。一個眞正懂得「創作」藝術的人，他是能將別人所不敢言，所不敢寫的東西，用巧譬妙喻，婉轉曲折的技巧，旁敲側擊，烘雲托月的方法，表露傳寫出來，使讀者心領意會，而仍不觸犯環境的禁忌的。何况，除了那些「悲哀的灰色製」，「沙漠似的寂寞」，「絕望的靈魂」，或流綫型式的多角戀愛。二十世紀的風花雪月，以及摩登才子佳人在薔薇花下的羅曼史等外，難道就再沒有旁的材料可以採用了嗎？假使我們「新文藝一的創作者，能眺出象牙塔，走到十字街頭上，用眼看，用耳聽，用腦思索，那末在這人生的檢閱塲中，大自社會內部的不安，勞苦大衆的騷動，小至販夫走卒的咒詛，賣報童子的泣訴，在在都是絕　的題材；再不然，就是寫寫自己所熟悉。所經歷過的日常見聞身邊瑣事，豈不也較那種海市蜃樓更要親切動人一些嗎？</p>
<p>不過，即使有了像高爾基那般豐常繁複，難以比擬的生活閱歷，而缺少從那實際經騐中汲取資料，提煉精華，以及將題材組織安排，穿綴歸納起來的氣魄和才調，還是無濟於事的，從戰壕中囘來的兵士，不能每個都成爲巴比塞或雷馬克，也正如豪貴子弟之不能人人都成爲曹雪芹或託爾斯泰一樣；僅僅有了經騐，未必就能創作優秀傑出的「新文藝」。那末，才調和氣魄是天賦的嗎？那些「天才論」者，他們說創作是要有甚麼「靈感」之類的東四的；於是他們甚麼也不想。一心等着那靈感之到來。他們喝了點酒，打算像谷訶一樣，一衝動起來。就祚畫布上歇斯底里地抹起顏料來；他們又帶着紙和筆到公園裏夫、想學悲多芬隨　帶了畫着五綫譜的紙，心血一來潮馬上就創作；可是等了老半大，靈感影踪毫無……。這樣看來。天才雖不能說完全沒有，可是單想憑　天才而創作，那是一件非常幼稚而可笑的事了。愛迪生再三吿訴靑年們說，「成功」是由一份的「靈感」拌和九份的「流汗」所造成的；僅有　體中的火花而不與努力聯綀，那末這火花是不能發揚光大而燃還原野的！</p>
<p>所謂「流汗」與「努力」，對於一個從事「新文藝」底創作者，就是指日積月累的不斷的修養而言。至於修養的方法，當然只有多讀。多寫，多思索，多批評。一個創作者總須具備三稱特長的器官：一是科學的眼睛，二是哲學的頭腦，三是藝術的手腕；其所以要具備科學的眼睛。就在用作觀察，要具備哲學的頭腦，就在用作於思辨，至於要具備藝術的手腕呢？那是因爲要表現創作的技巧。</p>
<p>但就創作的立塲而論，文體的修飾遠不及思想的修飬來得重要。果然，行文秀麗，修詞華贍，這是一個作家的必具條件；雖說雕字琢句是雕蟲小技，韓昌黎恥之爲俳優粉墨，倘使不講究修詞，便有實質巧思，也無法灌注到讀者的心裏去；但文飾只是形式，思想是是內容，文飾好似胭脂花粉，思想好似美人，有了美人，加上胭脂花粉，纔愈顯出美麗。你倘然是眞美喝便沒有胭脂花粉，也不致失了你的美，倘使你不是美人。用了胭脂花粉，反而叫你獻醜！我們看一篇羽獵賦，壽序，或某某公的墓誌銘。還不如聽一隻山歌好。因爲後者是有眞趣的，側重感情的，而前者是徒講關體的，戴假面具的；任何事物，假使不「眞」，也就不「着」，更談不到「美」了。</p>
<p>說到這裏，使我想起一部份「舊文學」的擁護者對於「新文薛」所加的批評。他們說目前許多「新文藝」底作品不是太幼稚，便是「拖泥帶水」，「韓灣抹角」，「濃得化不開」……，這是誰部不能否認的：可是他們不肯平心靜氣地想想，「新文藝」的發展還是「五四啓蒙運動」以後，近數十年來的事；目前尙在抽芽長莖的時期中。具有數千年悠久歷　的「舊文學」，還不免有計多缺點，何况是這個出世未久，尙未發育的嬰孩？但僅僅就這數十年，牠就已產生了如此許多劃時代的偉大作品，受了千千萬萬前進老的推重和愛好，在廣大的羣衆中普遍流行，那未，牠底前途的伸展滋榮，光明燦爛，是不難預期的。</p>
<p>因此，我們謹以萬分的熱忱，盼望每一個事業「新文藝」底創作者，要認眞地生活，不斷地學習，鄭重地寫作，才不辜負時代所賦與的使命，</p>
<h3>爸爸的眼睛睜着</h3>
<p>— 天棄仲弢</p>
<p>爸爸：你到了另一個世界，已經有九個月了。是去年九月十二日八點半鐘，一個深秋的晚上，因爲是鄉村，四週寂寞得可怕我和母親弟妹坐在牀前陪着你，你那時的神態很安靜：你眼睜睜的望着我們，你是否是覺得你自己就要離開我們，因而要在我們中間竭力找尋出一絲希望來，我不知道。慢慢的你的四肢冷起來，你的心贓停止跳動，然而你的眼睛仍舊睜得很大，再也不能揉攏。爸爸！你放心不下：恐怕我們不能在社會上立足！啊，爸爸！母親弟妹號咷大哭着，那時的我，却並不哭，也沒有一點感覺，我只是茫茫然。我痴痴的望着橫在牀上却再也不會活動的你的體軀，我覺得生和死太神秘了，這中問的距離竟是這樣的近，像跨過一條門限一般。夜色非常的濃，母親哭得疲倦，已經睡着：牀旁點着一盞豆油燈，天井裏的　風把火燄威脅著，也把天竹搖撼得颯颯的響。</p>
<p>爸爸！你在這個世界中沒有產業，然而有着好幾個子女，二個已經成年的（哥哥和我），沒有一點建樹：二個尙在童年，正是需要敎育的時期：一個女兒沒有出嫁，我也沒有婚娶這責任是相當的重大。你病得很重，睡在牀上，想到了這一點，你說：「再活十年，子女的敎育婚嫁，粗粗可了，我也就放心了。只要十年呵……」然而你終竟給病魔殘殺了。在最後的一刹那，你並不甘心，還想掙扎一下，你的眼睛睜得很大；你恐怕你的子女受苦，你態傷得落下淚來！爸爸，你丟下我們走了，我們就生活在苦難中，正如你所想像的！</p>
<p>啊，不敢再想。爸爸！你在幾個子女中是比較的喜愛我，也對我寄着很深的希望；但是，現在呢？我數年奮鬬的結果，我比不上一個小商店裏的職員，我比不上一個茶役，一個工人，不，簡直此一個乞食者還不如！我在物質方而沒有享受，在精神上沒有慰藉，我孤單地過着寂寞的歲月。於是我看戲，吃酒，我要麻醉我痛苦的神經。爸爸！我不再想到努力，我不再要求成功，只是糊糊塗塗的打發日子。然而我在一想到你的睜着的眼時——啊，我就聯想到母親的幸福，弟弟的敎育，妹妹的出嫁，我自己的前途，我壓抑不住我的情感，我覺得我的心像紋一般的在痛，我是這樣的荒廢，我對不起你——爸爸，我還對得起你嗎？我就只有哭若，哭着，直到疲倦把我帶入了睡鄉……。</p>
<p>爸爸，你時常教訓我們：不要食求不義的錢財，並且說，用不正當的手段得來的財富也是不會久長的。所以你辦了一世的敎育，幫助着地方上的行政還是非常的窮困。你一些也不怨憤，你只是　勉着我們努力求得一種自立的技能，你也就安心了。你在經濟寬裕的時候，你總把它來送給貧民；在吃飯的時候，也時常把飯送給乞食者。你說：「有多餘的施送給人家，這是最好的事，切不要吝嗇。」啊，爸爸，你在自己也只吃粥的時候，還省下一點來送給人家，你的心是多麼的慈悲！你不肯投機取巧，又是如何的忠厚！你日常所巡見的，都是一羣沒有地位，毫無知識的鄕民，但是你對他們非常和藹，他們也非常的敬重你；他們知道你病重，常常來問：好了些沒有？待到他們聽到你的噩耗，沒有一個不嘆息的！爸爸，你太好了，你給我的印象，叫我永遠忘不了；不但在疾痛慘怛的現在，在將來，在我死前的一剎那，我仍舊不曾忘懷你的恩情！</p>
<p>爸爸！兒子現在的心緒異常的煩亂，我想着你，我經歷着人世問的一切不平，啊，我不能再忍受，我眞想自殺！但是，你眼睜睜的　着我，這眼光裏而含着悲哀，懇求，希望，不安，驚駭，種秤的情緒，就把我死的念頭動搖了；可憐的生命，還有再比既無生活趣味而又不能死去痛苦的麼？我彷徨，彷徨在生死途上。爸爸！恕我！我不能繼續你的事業，我不能實現你的希望，我再也沒有勇氣生活下去！而且，我只想和你厮守在一起……。</p>
<p>爸爸！我在聽到別人說起他的父親時，我就想念你；在夜間，我想念你；在日裏有一點空閒，也就往往想起你；一想起，我只覺得心酸萬分，淚珠就不禁流下來。啊，爸爸！我不知怎樣才好！我不能解決現實的事，我不能丟開我對你的悲痛，希望你在夢中告訴我！爸爸！請你告訴我，我是你可憐的兒子喲！</p>

<h3>商統會與中日經濟關係（一）</h3>
<p>— 栗木寅治</p>
<p>日本對華政策的推進　就是移政策於實踐的最顯著表現，第一應該提出的。就是在中國主權之下、中國的統治經濟快要發展成功了。而且這種工作，交給華方民問人士來國，這的確是劃時期的創舉。這次設立的商統會、就是具有如此性格的組織。商統會的性能，可以說是中國經濟的中樞神經，</p>
<p>用這種自治統制經濟形式來處理中國經濟，恐怕還是中國有史以來的創舉吧。所以，自治統制經濟的成功與吾，還得要看今後的成績如何，然而就中國自主參戰典其參　意義來說，那末中國人無論遭遇何種困難，爲完成大東亞戰爭的勝利，必然要負起責任來完成這個重大責務，就是我日本方而。尤其是在中國的日本經濟人，更要如此，總之，我們不惜與華方經濟人携手，傾全力來協助中國確立統制經濟，這也是課於我們的義務。</p>
<p>當地的日僑，旣　商統會下層機構的構成份子　地位而參加，則日本人應該傾其特種技能　憑或多年經騐所得的知能，儘量發揮，以達成共同目的。</p>
<p>商統會的根本原則：就是屬於中國主權的公益性機關。所以其運用事項，規定完全由華方掌理，這是極公正而賢明的措置，這一點我們衷心感到愉快，同時也是中日當道的賢明措置有以致之。這種事實，和日本的撤廢在華治外法權，交還租界，都可以說是日本實踐對華政策的左　證。換句話說，這就是證明日本的對華政策不是口頭禪，始終尊重中國的主權，而且中日間的一切問題，都從這種見地出發的。這一次的措置，經濟上也實現了，政治上也實現了，可以認爲是實行中日平等的階段已經達到了。</p>
<p>所以，華方官民，也必須與日方抱同一見解努力運用這一點，過去唐理事長數度說明；商統會所　的重大使命，同時對商統會及下層機構的職員訓話中。也說得很明白，不過找想在此稍爲强調一下，並展望對商統會的期待。（未完）</p>

<h3>Crushing the Anglo-American Diplomatic Conspiracy</h3>
<p>The situation of the international war is advancing towards a decisive stage day by day. Having suffered heavy blows in the Pacific, Britain and the United States, although constantly clamoring to attack Europe, and even extravagantly talking about a counter-offensive in the Pacific, in reality have no strength to carry out adventures. Therefore, their activities are still not relaxed in the political and diplomatic spheres. Britain and the United States, with their traditional cunning international conspiracy policy, do not dare to engage in frontal warfare, but attempt to win by trickery through diplomatic conspiracies. For their own victory, they have constantly sacrificed the interests of other countries and the interests of their allies. Before the Second European War, they sacrificed Czechoslovakia. Since the war, they have sacrificed the military strength of France, Canada, India, Chongqing, and the Soviet Union. Even between Britain and the United States, they are constantly deceiving and evading each other. Not long ago, the Washington Ro-Chu talks quietly ended without gaining the trust of Stalin, and the brevity of the conclusions was the opposite of the sensationalism before the talks, fully revealing the shadows among the anti-Axis countries. Precisely because of this, they are exaggerating and publicizing news such as the concentration of landing ships in a certain port or bay, the transfer of large numbers of troops in a certain place, and fierce air battles, while using political and diplomatic conspiracies to replace military offensives.</p>
<p>We can see that the political and diplomatic offensive of Britain and the United States is concentrated on the following three points: First, a diplomatic conspiracy against the Soviet Union centered on a counter-offensive in the Pacific, attempting to exchange the Soviet Union's concession of the Far East region as an air force base for Britain and the United States, and then open a second front in Europe. This was originally an attempt that the United States and even Chongqing had dreamed of for many years but had not realized. The US conspiracy against the Soviet Union has always been noticed by all parties, and warnings have been constantly issued to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, which has greatly depleted its strength after two full years of arduous fighting, even if it is so foolish as not to see the deceptive nature of this greed of the United States, is in fact impossible to wage war on the eastern border and act as a cat's paw for Britain and the United States. The first diplomatic conspiracy of Britain and the United States is bound to encounter complete failure. The second is to launch political work against European countries, threatening to sacrifice the opening of a second front in Europe at all costs. The main aspect of this work is naturally placed in Turkey and Spain first. As early as after the Casablanca Conference, Churchill paid a visit to Turkey. Not long ago, the British Middle East Army Commander-in-Chief Wilson, and now British Admiral Cunningham, visited the Turkish government one after another, nothing more than threats and inducements, attempting to get Turkey to allow the anti-Axis forces to use Turkish territory and troops to attack the Balkans and other places. Secondly, there are activities against Spain, as pointed out by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun on June 12: "They also want to form Anglo-American special forces on the border of Spanish and French Morocco. The purpose of this army probably has political significance, attempting to overthrow General Franco's dictatorship, support the Spanish free democracy movement, establish a new government organized by pro-British people, or establish a monarchy. French Morocco is currently gathering various Spanish opposition parties to form a democratic volunteer army, which also shows this tendency."</p>
<p>In addition to the increasing political activities against neutral countries, the third conspiracy is to incite political turmoil in the military control and political rule areas of the European Axis countries. The most important tool they use is the rumor of "peace", attempting to use this to create the so-called second and third "Darland." To create a series of political incidents and even incite armed rebellions, in order to shake people's hearts and the order in the rear of the Axis countries, as pointed out by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun editorial on the 11th of this month. These conspiracies are actually nothing more than despicable activities taken by the British and American authorities because of their military weakness, and naturally will not produce much effect. However, at the same time, we cannot fail to be vigilant that the small countries in Europe are currently facing extremely serious crises. Each of them has to cope with increasingly fierce and brutal bombings, and at the same time, they must strengthen the strength of the domestic front. At present, Italy is under the most cruel test. The bombings of the Italian mainland and the large and small islands in the Mediterranean are intensifying. Especially since the fall of Pantelleria Island, the brutality of the air raids has been invading Italy with the fierce tools of nerve warfare. However, Italy, which has been participating in the war for exactly three years, is strengthening its unity with Japan and Germany. Everyone is holding the determination to win the final victory and will not have the slightest wavering or division under the bombing. We believe that the Italians, who once created the opportunity for the European Renaissance and have long been admired in the world's national liberation struggle, will certainly not waver or bow their heads in front of difficulties or enemies.</p>
<p>All the political and diplomatic conspiracies of the enemy must fail. The evolution of the Argentine coup is gradually becoming unfavorable to the United States. The development of the anti-British and American struggle in Honduras, the development of the anti-British and American movement in India, the lack of thorough coordination within the French National Committee jointly formed by Girod and de Gaulle in North Africa, and even Stalin's resolute rejection of the United States' use of the Far East as a base of operations, can all be said to be the beginning of the failure of the entire British and American political and diplomatic conspiracy. The most important force that can give a decisive blow to the Anglo-American conspiracy is the unity and seamless cooperation of the large and small countries in the Pacific, the development of military cooperation, and the development of production and construction, as clearly declared by Prime Minister Tojo of the friendly country at the opening of the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet on the 16th of this month. We must move towards the path of defeating Britain and the United States and establish the foundation for the inevitable victory of the East Asian national liberation movement. The spirit and practice of our East Asian nations' sincere unity, cooperation, and shared life and death will surely stimulate Europe and serve as a model for them to crush the enemy's conspiracies. In the decisive battle in the future, the seamless unity of the Eastern nations will naturally lay the foundation for the final victory. However, despite this, we still cannot fail to call on the Eastern nations to pay attention. The political conspiracies that Britain and the United States are secretly active in various parts of Europe will certainly not extend their claws to East Asia at the same time. We must always be vigilant, everyone must be serious and tense, strengthen unity, thoroughly crush the enemy's nerve offensive and diplomatic conspiracies, expose any conspiracies of the enemy in East Asia, and give them a head-on blow, and then we will guarantee the final victory against Britain and the United States.</p>

<h3>Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee Held Appointment Ceremony Yesterday, Commander Kuroda Hosted a Banquet for Service Corps Representatives, Praising the Filipino People's Efforts to Build a New Philippines</h3>
<p>Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese dispatch army to the Philippines announced the matter of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee at 11:00 a.m. on the 20th, saying: The supreme commander of the Japanese army in the Philippines recently approved the personnel selected by the Special All-Island Congress of the New Philippine Service Corps to form the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee and ordered them to proceed with the preparation of the Philippines' independence as soon as possible. The chairman of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee is Laurel, the first vice chairman is Avanceña, the second vice chairman is Aquino, and there are a total of 18 preparatory members.</p>
<p>Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) - The appointment ceremony for the preparatory members of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee was solemnly held at the official residence of the Supreme Commander at 11:00 a.m. today. At that time, 20 preparatory members (Chairman Laurel was absent due to illness) gathered in the hall of the official residence. The Japanese dispatch army, led by Supreme Commander Kuroda and more than 20 military and political supervisors, also attended. The meeting started on time. First, Supreme Commander Kuroda read out the appointment letter, and then Vice Chairman Avanceña represented Chairman Laurel to express the determination to advance the independence movement. The appointment ceremony was then concluded, and everyone toasted together, wishing the future well.</p>
<p>Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) - Kuroda, the army commander of the Philippines, hosted a banquet at noon on the 20th to entertain more than 100 representatives of the New Philippine Service Corps, praising the Filipino people's efforts to build a new Philippines, and hoping that they would continue to make progress in the future to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>The New Life Service Corps Has More Than 600,000 Members</p>
<p>Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Philippines has now broken free from the shackles of the United States and Spain for 400 years, and will complete its glorious independence as a young member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The New Life Philippine Service Corps is a national organization with the spirit of restoring East Asia in the Philippines. Since its establishment, it has only been half a year, but it has already launched active activities. On the 18th of this month, it was ordered by the Japanese dispatch army to the Philippines to organize a committee and become the mother body for realizing independence. Its political importance is particularly noteworthy. Because the organizational program of the Philippine Bird Service Corps is to unite all the people of the island, actively assist the Japanese military administration, and increase common welfare. In other words, its goal is to unify the activities and service capabilities of the current social, cultural, and economic groups, completely eliminate Anglo-American colors, and cultivate the inherent virtues of East Asia, such as honesty, prudence, devotion to public service, diligence, and sacrifice, and improve physical strength to restore it to a healthy East Asian nation. Its organizational regulations stipulate that men and women over the age of 18 are qualified to join the group. The president is held by Director Vargas. The current number of members has exceeded 600,000. Since its establishment, the group has become an ideological and cultural group and has not involved political colors at all. In accordance with the principles proposed by the military and political supervisor that are conducive to the Philippines' implementation of independence, it actively assists the military administration in ensuring security, reorganizing the economy to seek local self-sufficiency, and restoring the spirit of East Asia. This is a concrete movement guideline for the Philippine Service Corps. The Philippine Service Corps is correcting the wrong concept of relying on Britain and the United States, restoring the original state of East Asians, and implementing the concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Since launching a enthusiastic enlightenment campaign and shouting "Philippine security should be maintained by the Philippine people," the general Filipino people have been able to automatically assist the Japanese army in ensuring security. In addition, a central security committee has been added to the executive government. All of this has made great contributions to the establishment of security. As for the reorganization of the economic movement, in order to complete the five-year food production increase plan, it has mobilized the labor force of the members and participated in food collection activities. A labor personnel training center was established in May of this year to provide labor personnel with spiritual education to cultivate the virtues of diligence. In addition, rural groups have been established to provide active assistance. A healthy people's movement has been launched, sports equipment has been added, and radio has been popularized. The welfare business has also been greatly revitalized. The activities of the Philippine Service Corps have recently become more active and concrete. After Prime Minister Tojo personally visited the Philippines, the emotions of the Philippine people in seeking the rapid realization of independence became more激揚, and they shouted "Contribute our blood." In summary, we can know that the Philippine Service Corps is the mother body for the birth of the new Philippine country. Its mission is very important, and it has changed from a past ideological and cultural group to a political character.</p>
<h3>Philippine Thanksgiving Assembly Vargas Speech</h3>
<p>Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Thanksgiving Independence Public Assembly hosted by the New Philippine Labor Service Corps was held in Manila at 5:00 p.m. on the 19th. No less than 300,000 people participated in the conference, an unprecedented grand occasion. The military and political supervisors and other ministers attended. Vargas, the president of the New Philippine Labor Service Corps, and others gave speeches to the crowd at the conference. The crowd was extremely excited. The conference then closed in a joyous voice.</p>
<p>Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) - On the second day of the Philippine Service Corps National Congress on the 19th, Vargas, the president of the group, delivered a speech, mainly saying: Today, the "bright day has begun" for our beloved motherland, the Philippines. The entire Philippines is full of joy, which is a happy thing. This glorious independence will be realized within the year due to the lenient measures taken by Japan. Recalling that we were previously used by the United States and mistakenly resisted the Japanese army, we now have no right to demand independence from Japan. However, Japan is helping us as a brotherly country, making us a member of the big family composed of East Asian countries. First, it allows us to be independent and declares that it will be realized within the year. We Filipinos should repay Japan's kindness with sincerity. I dare to say that Japan has assisted the independence of the Philippines in the past. Therefore, after independence, the Philippines should permanently share weal and woe, live and die together with Japan. Today, in addition to thanking God, we also thank Japan, and we are determined to move forward together with Japan in the future.</p>
<h3>Thai Prime Minister Phibun Telegraphs to Thank Prime Minister Tojo</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency) - Thai Prime Minister Phibun, with Prime Minister Tojo of Japan having stated in the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet that Japan intends to cooperate again in Thailand's development, telegraphed to Prime Minister Tojo on the 19th to express his gratitude.

<h3>Japanese Ambassador Tani Masayuki Leaves Japan to Return to His Post</h3>
<p>Fukuoka, 20th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to China Tani Masayuki returned to his country some time ago to report on his duties. Recently, because his mission has been completed, he took a plane on the morning of the 20th to return to his post.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Attacks, War Results of the Fifth War Zone of Chongqing</h3>
<p>Hankou, (Central News Agency) - The troops of Li Zongren of Chongqing (Fifth War Zone), in order to contain the Japanese army's summer offensive this time, actively counter-attacked in the area north of Yingcheng. However, after suffering repeated heavy blows from the Japanese army, they retreated northward in panic. On June 2, when a certain unit of the Japanese army attacked the Chongqing "122nd Division of the 41st Army" which was counter-attacking north of Yingcheng, it encircled and struck the 3,000 Chongqing troops at the Tianwang Temple Heights 14 kilometers east of Jingshan. On June 6, it defeated the Chongqing "127th Division of the 45th Army" near Renhedian, 32 kilometers northwest of Yingcheng, forcing them to flee into the mountains to the north. Although the Japanese army reversed its direction, it still seized the opportunity to counter-attack at any time. Therefore, at dawn on the 13th, with the cooperation of the aviation unit, it encircled the Chongqing troops from three aspects: Jiadian Renhedian and Leigongdian, 32 kilometers northwest of Yingcheng. It launched a brave annihilation battle on the evening of the 14th, completely crushing the Chongqing army's attempt. The war results obtained by the Japanese army in that area were that Chongqing abandoned 856 corpses, and 175 people were captured. The Japanese army seized three mortars, eight heavy machine guns, 132 rifles, and other light machine gun parts, various bullets and medicines, etc.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) - Since Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying participated in the peace movement, more and more Chongqing generals have continued to come back. This fact has fully exposed the truth that Chongqing is in a dilemma after losing the name of resistance war. Chongqing's internal electricity has also been greatly impacted because of this, and the tendency to participate in the peace movement is becoming increasingly obvious. Therefore, Chongqing officials and generals also suspect and guard against each other, resulting in an abnormal chaotic situation within the Chongqing army. According to the information received here, a division commander of a certain Sichuan army has been arrested on suspicion of defecting, and a certain officer of the 7th War Zone has also been executed for expressing war-weary words in a letter to his colleagues. These facts are solid evidence of the current chaotic situation within Chongqing. According to Chongqing electricity, Yu Pengfei, the rear service minister of the Chongqing Military Commission, arrived in Xi'an via Baoji on the 15th. The purpose of this trip seems to be to adjust the transportation and supply after the annihilation of the Jicha Border Region Army, and other rear preparation matters, and to discuss the aftermath policies with the local authorities. However, the Jicha Border Region Army has suffered a major blow in morale due to the participation of the two generals, Pang and Sun, and other main generals, leading 70,000 troops in the peace movement. Recovery is impossible. Although Chongqing is now making every effort to conceal the truth to stabilize the military's morale, due to the loss of Chongqing's name for the war of resistance and the unfavorable war situation, its future is truly not optimistic, and it will inevitably become one of the main reasons for the collapse. There is no doubt.</p>
<h3>U.S. Water Conservancy Committee Chairman Discusses Flood Control Problems</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - This year's spring has been continuously rainy, and there are concerns about floods in summer and autumn. Jiang Zuoxuan, chairman of the Water Conservancy Committee of the Ministry of Construction, said that the rainfall in Nanjing this year was more than 110 mm in March, more than 100 mm in April, and more than 130 mm in May (more than 170 mm in May last year), which was not particularly much compared to the past three years. Examining the water level of the Yangtze River in Nanjing, it is currently 7 meters, which is not necessarily higher than this time last year. The Huai River rose early this year, reaching 14 and a half meters in April, and now it is close to 16 meters. Although it is very high, there is still hope that it will not be as high as last year. In summary, the Huai River is indeed high this year, and the Yangtze River cannot be said to be low, but there is no need to worry about floods immediately. It is necessary to judge the rainfall and the water coming from the Yellow River in the future. Although God's will is unpredictable, human efforts must be exhausted. Therefore, flood control work must not be neglected, especially in the months of July and August. In view of this, the Ministry of Construction has long prepared a general outline of flood control measures for three provinces and two cities, which has been submitted to the court for approval and implemented in sections. The general outline of the measures adopts a system of hierarchical responsibility for flood control work: (1) First, the central government formulates methods and subsidizes funds, and is responsible for advocacy; (2) Second, local governments formulate detailed rules, divide the area on the ground, organize the people, and allocate funds to pre-purchase materials, and are responsible for preparation; (3) When the flood arrives, in addition to receiving the funds and materials prepared by the government, the local people share the financial resources and are responsible for day and night patrols and temporary emergency rescue. In this way, the government will not suffer from the pain of being out of reach, and the people will benefit from the power of struggle. Official-civilian cooperation will increase efficiency.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Shonan, 20th - The Malayan military administration has decided to establish a five-year plan for the development of southern industries. They are striving to establish a self-sufficient system in the military-occupied areas in the south and to obtain important national defense resources. Therefore, they initially plan to utilize the iron ore available in Malaya to establish an iron-making industry, and actively enhance power generation capacity and the manufacture of alum and lead industries using bauxite ore as raw material, as well as the textile industry and other daily necessities and sundry goods manufacturing industries. Currently, the military administration is formulating specific plans based on the principle of suitability for each location, targeting the entire southern region.</p>

<h3>Syrian Coast Declared a Military Zone - Batch of Black Soldiers Arrives in Egypt</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Ankara, 20th - According to a Beirut dispatch from the Maritime News Agency, the entire coast from Beirut to Latakia has been declared a military zone.

<p>Central News Agency, Istanbul, 20th - The border between Syria and Turkey was suddenly blocked by British garrison authorities on the 15th and was only lifted at 6:00 AM on the 17th, lasting a total of 48 hours. According to observers, this is probably because reinforcements for the anti-Axis forces have departed from the Belgian Congo in Africa and are heading towards Syria. The British blockade of the border is likely to conceal the movement of these troops.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rome, 20th - According to the Fascist newspaper, the first batch of African black soldiers recruited by the United States in the Belgian Congo has already arrived in Egypt. These black soldiers will be under the command of the British and American forces in the Middle East.</p>

<h3>Tokyo Newspapers Discuss Significance of Bose's Arrival - Italian Government and Public Welcome - Britain Concerned About Bose's Future Movements</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - Since the arrival of Indian independence movement leader Chandra Bose in Japan, the future of India has been filled with limitless brightness. Editorials in various newspapers here on the 20th focused on this topic, adding commentary. The following is the gist of the Asahi Shimbun's editorial: The sudden arrival in Tokyo of Chandra Bose, the vanguard leader of the Indian independence movement, to appeal to the world for Indian independence, is not only shocking news for the whole world, but also extremely welcome news. As Bose stated in his declaration, although the British are fond of advocating national self-determination and constantly praising democracy and equality, their policy toward India is extremely tyrannical and oppressive. From this perspective, Britain is indeed, as he said, India's "eternal enemy." It is also the enemy of all countries and nations in the world that love permanent peace and national freedom. He said that after the Axis victory, the United States' ambition to dominate the world and the British Empire would inevitably collapse, and India would thus obtain a good opportunity for independence. Therefore, the connection between the Axis countries and India is based on this common interest. At the same time, the relationship between Japan and India is particularly close due to various important conditions in geography, economy, politics, and other aspects. The Japanese people have always sincerely hoped that India can be liberated and that the construction of India by the Indian people can be realized. Therefore, they express their welcome to the great leader of India, Bose, and deeply understand the efforts and sincerity he has shown for the construction of the Greater East Asia, which aims at eternal peace in East Asia, and have the sincerity of full cooperation, which is sincerely pleasing.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rome, 20th - The Italian government and public unanimously expressed their welcome after learning that Indian independence fighter Chandra Bose had arrived safely in Tokyo, and wished the Indian independence movement a bright future.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 20th - According to a London dispatch: The British government and public attach great importance to the visit of Indian independence giant Chandra Bose to Japan, and are extremely concerned about his future movements. Reuters also received a similar report from Japan Broadcasting Corporation without any criticism.</p>
<p>Reactions Among the German People</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 20th - Yesterday, German newspapers all published the news of Bose's arrival in Tokyo. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung commented: The arrival of this Indian leader in Japan is an important political factor. His departure from Germany to Japan proves the close cooperation of the Axis powers. All newspapers hope that the Indian people can achieve independence under Bose's leadership.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 20th - The visit to Japan by Indian independence movement fighter Chandra Bose has caused a great reaction among the German people. The German Foreign Communication Agency commented: When Mr. Bose set off to leave Europe, we were sad to say goodbye, but because his return to the Far East has a legitimate reason, it is not convenient to stop him. The great achievements of the Japanese army in Southeast Asia have given the Indian independence movement a new opportunity. In order to take advantage of this excellent opportunity to start importing important tasks, Mr. Bose's return to East Asia is very good. In his recent speech, Prime Minister Tojo repeatedly stated that in order to free India from the shackles of Britain, Japan will prepare to provide various assistance. Moreover, Japan's attitude towards the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and all ethnic groups has been deeply understood by the Indian people. Moreover, Mr. Bose was able to go from India to Europe, and this time from Europe to Japan. This is enough to show the Indian people that the Anglo-Saxons are no longer the rulers of the world, so the spiritual impact is also great. At the same time, the Indian people have discovered their own strength in seeking liberation. According to this view, the Indian independence movement will definitely progress rapidly, and under the leadership of such a lover of gardens as Bose, India will soon be able to obtain freedom without any doubt.</p>
<h3>Bose's Status in India</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - Among modern Indian leaders, besides Gandhi, who occupies a uniquely high position, the next most important are Chandra Bose and Nehru. They are both the bravest fighters in "Fighting India," and Chandra Bose's political position is particularly unique. Although Nehru and Bose both belong to the radical faction of the National Congress Party and are known as "socialists," in practice, they still follow Gandhi as their model. As for Chandra Bose, his respect and admiration for Gandhi are second to none, and he is one of the few people in India who can directly comment on Gandhi. He once praised Gandhi's career, saying that most of today's National Congress Party was created by Gandhi, and the organization of the Congress Party is Gandhi's career. He has also transformed the Congress Party from a mere discussion group into a fighting machine. When constitutionalism in the Indian independence struggle declined in 1919-20, and violentism was about to replace it, the masses rose up to seek new methods of struggle and needed new leaders. Gandhi arose at the right time and led the masses, so Bose once praised Gandhi as "the son of India's destiny." As for 1935, Bose once speculated on Gandhi's future struggle, saying that when the British government uses force against India in the future, whether Gandhi can maintain his inherent political position will depend on whether he can adopt a more radical policy. If he can dedicate himself to the work of radical struggle at that time, I am afraid that no one can stop him. I believe that at that time, he will still be the hero who leads the Indian people in the stage of the Indian struggle. In the next stage of the Indian struggle, he will still be the hero who leads the Indian people. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Gandhi has indeed, as Bose had said, initiated an anti-British movement, starting to reduce the "orderly anarchy" that oppresses India, and finally launching an armed rebellion. Bose is very happy about this. Currently, Bose is working hard along the path of struggle pioneered by Gandhi. Bose's political beliefs are very clear. He believes that seeking India's political independence is the major premise for reviving India and liberating the Indian nation. To achieve this goal, all means must be adopted and struggles must be engaged in. Therefore, he argues: "We should not forget that it was the British who taught the Indians the policy of violence. We should treat the British in the same way they treat us." Therefore, he firmly advocates that in order to win India's independence, an armed revolution should be launched immediately. From this, we can see that Bose can launch the "vanguard movement" from a difficult environment because he has the passion and organizational skills to mobilize the masses. Bose is even more advanced than Gandhi in this regard. His strong belief is "no struggle, no honor." This saying can be regarded as his motto. In fact, he is a fighter for the British, and hopes to win India's independence from the bloody battlefield. Therefore, he is the successor to Gandhi, not only a loyal follower of Gandhi, but also a hero with the passion and fighting spirit to complete Gandhi's cause of Indian independence. He can be regarded as a representative figure among modern Indian fighters. This is also well known to Gandhi and the Indian people. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Indian people have all learned that Bose is a "defender of India" and are eager for him to come from Germany to lead the Indian independence movement. Last May, it was rumored that Bose died in Berlin due to a plane crash, and the Indian people were greatly shocked. All over India, flags were flown at half-mast and markets were closed to express mourning. At that time, Gandhi even said of Bose's death: "India has lost a giant star," but soon learned that this news was fabricated by the British. Bose's roar spread from Berlin to India, and the Indian people rekindled their long-lost hope in that instant. All of India was overjoyed, and they raised the flag of Indian independence and celebrated, which made the British authorities very embarrassed, and Gandhi also publicly congratulated Bose's mother. In short, today's Chandra Bose's safety is enough to influence the mood of the entire Indian people. Therefore, he has become a great man worshiped by the entire Indian people, and is the successor to the Indian Mahatma (meaning great soul).</p>
<h3>Fierce Positional Warfare in the Orel and Velizh Areas - Soviet Offensive in Kuban Suffers Further Losses - Their Fighting Spirit Has Significantly Decreased</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 20th - According to reports from the Eastern Front, Soviet forces in the Kuban region suddenly launched another offensive on the evening of the 18th, attacking German strongholds under the cover of powerful artillery and air force, but were repelled by German forces and suffered heavy losses. In addition, fierce positional warfare also took place in the Orel and Velizh areas on the 18th. The offensive and defensive battles in the Orel salient have been fought intensely day and night for several days, and are now gradually expanding. In another report, Soviet forces launched another counterattack in the Mtsensk area, 30 kilometers northwest of Orel. German and Soviet forces are currently engaged in a death struggle. Observing this situation, the Eastern Front war will gradually develop into a large-scale operation on the entire front, centered on the main battle areas of Kupiansk, Orel, and Velizh. The public believes that this implies that the nature of this year's summer campaign is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 20th - The German News Agency learned last night that Soviet troops launched a local attack on the German positions in the Kuban bridgehead with strong troops on Wednesday, but without any success. Although the Soviet infantry used powerful artillery and fighter squadrons, they failed to break into the German defense line and were repelled at all locations. In addition to the death of hundreds of Soviet troops, 248 people were captured. The fighting in the lower Kuban region has lasted for two months, and the Soviet army has only received a small amount of replenishment, and its fighting spirit has obviously decreased. According to prisoners, the food and other supplies of the Soviet army in the area have been greatly reduced, so morale is also depressed. There have been only small-scale battles in other front areas, especially in the northeastern part of the Orel front and east of Velizh. The advance of the Soviet assault troops in each place was blocked in front of the German forward positions. Major Freytag, an air force representative of the German News Agency, said: The German Air Force continued to carry out planned attacks on the Soviet railway and highways on Friday, with considerable success. Soviet military industrial equipment was also attacked on Friday evening. German aircraft also sank two fully loaded freighters with a total of 11,000 tons at the mouth of the Volga River, and severely damaged two freighters with a total of 8,000 tons. A dive bomber squadron destroyed a Soviet railway bridge south of Leningrad. Soviet fighters attempted to intercept German aircraft but were also intercepted by German fighters, shooting down 31 Soviet aircraft. There were no losses for German aircraft. In total, the Soviets lost 45 aircraft on Friday, and two German aircraft failed to return.</p>
<h3>Wavell Appointed Governor-General - Indian People Dissatisfied</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 20th - According to a Bombay dispatch, the Madras Indian newspaper yesterday expressed regret over the appointment of Marshal Wavell as Governor-General of India. The newspaper said: "The Indian people, in their current mood, will definitely oppose this appointment, believing that it proves that Churchill is still opposed to the aspirations of the Indian people."</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence</p>
<h3>端午在北京</h3>
<p>— Scholar</p>
<p>The Sequel to the Records of the Qi Harmonizer states: "Qu Yuan drowned himself in the river on the fifth day of the fifth month. The people of Chu mourned him and put rice in bamboo tubes and threw them into the water, wrapped in reed leaves and tied with colored threads, so that they would not be swallowed by dragons." Is the Dragon Boat Festival, as a festival to commemorate the suicide of a patriotic poet, at least a recognized fact in legend? According to traditional customs, the day is not only as described in the Records of Customs: "cooking horn-shaped dumplings," but also includes dragon boat races, inserting cattails and wormwood, drinking realgar wine, pasting pest-repelling talismans, wearing sachets, and so on. Regarding dragon boat races, the Sui History: Geography states that "Qu Yuan went to the Miluo River on the fifteenth day of the fifth month. The local people chased him to Dongting Lake but could not find him. The lake was large and the boats were small, so no one could cross. Then they sang, 'How can we cross the lake?' Therefore, they drummed and rowed to compete to return. They gathered at the pavilion to compete, and the custom was passed down as a dragon boat race." However, the Record of the Seasons of Jing and Chu quotes the Cao E Stele, saying, "On the fifth day of the fifth month, they welcomed Wu Jun against the tide, but she was drowned by the water." This is a custom in the Wu region, related to Wu Zixu, and has nothing to do with Qu Yuan. The Record of the Seasons of Jing and Chu also quotes the Records of Yue, saying that it originated with King Goujian of Yue. In this case, it is uncertain whether dragon boat races, or even the act of throwing oneself into the water during the festival, have an absolute connection with Qu Yuan, as Professor Zhao Yintang of Peking University stated accurately on the Dragon Boat Festival on the Beijing Central Broadcasting Station. But this is not the important issue. Anyway, a festival commemoration always has its social reasons, and secular customs often incorporate other elements. Inserting wormwood on the doorframe and pasting pest-repelling talismans on the door on the Dragon Boat Festival are clearly later additions. During the Ming Dynasty, officials and people in the capital would gather at the Temple of Heaven, hold horse races, and wear wormwood clothes and cattail shoes on the Dragon Boat Festival, not just hanging a few cattails and wormwood. The emperors of the Liao Dynasty even wore clothes made of wormwood leaves and cotton picked on the Dragon Boat Festival, making a great fashion statement. As for pest-repelling talismans, they are related to Zhang Tianshi's exorcism of the five poisonous creatures. Last year, during the Dragon Boat Festival, Beijing Central Radio broadcast a story in a crisp, delicate voice to children about how Zhang Tianshi came to Beijing to expel the five poisonous creatures. These have nothing to do with the story of the Minister of the Three Households throwing himself into the river.</p>
<p>We do not need to investigate the origin of the Dragon Boat Festival in detail, but it is undeniable that this festival is a major festival commemorated by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>If the Dragon Boat Festival originated with Qu Yuan, then this frustrated poet can be considered to have exhaled a sigh of relief in his death by throwing himself into the river. His suicide built a gate to the underworld for the poor, and many poor people, unable to pass this festival, took the same step as Qu Yuan. But on the other hand, he created many opportunities for the wealthy and romantic poets to enjoy the pleasures of life. Such powers of exercising authority and granting favors are probably beyond the reach of any emperor in the human world. Qu Yuan's spirit should be extremely satisfied.</p>
<p>However, due to general economic bankruptcy, besides this gate to the underworld becoming increasingly solid, the Dragon Boat Festival can no longer provide people with much opportunity for enjoyment. More than a decade ago, we could still see the dragon boat race spectacle declining year by year. Now, this custom has almost sunk to the bottom of the rivers along with the broken, irreparable planks everywhere. Even in Beijing, the former imperial capital, people who are slightly younger cannot even imagine what a dragon boat looks like.</p>
<p>Last year's Dragon Boat Festival was already dull enough. This year, the food problem in Beijing is the most alarming, but the Dragon Boat Festival was not as bleak as most people imagined. Three weeks ago, the government specially allocated an extra two catties of flour per person for the Dragon Boat Festival in the fourth ration. Because the newspapers reported it too vaguely, most people thought there would be a special Dragon Boat Festival ration in addition to the fourth ration, until two days before the Dragon Boat Festival, the newspapers made a clarification, and everyone suddenly understood. However, these two catties of Dragon Boat Festival rations did cause quite a stir for some time. Perhaps due to the festival or the government's strict enforcement of fixed prices, the price of grain actually fell a bit a few days before the Dragon Boat Festival. Although the price of rice only dropped from three yuan and two corners to three yuan per catty, it still gave people a lot of relief. What attracted the most attention was the newspaper announcement that the Beijing Municipal Government and the New People's Association would jointly hold a "dragon boat race" at 10:00 AM on the Dragon Boat Festival, and that citizen regattas and citizen carnivals would be held in Beihai Park and Central Park in the afternoon. The entertainment advertisements even had reports that Zhang Junqiu would perform the festival opera "Hun Yuan He" on the Dragon Boat Festival. All of this seemed to give people the feeling of "celebrating the festival."</p>
<p>Two days before the Dragon Boat Festival, Chairman Zhu issued a special notice to his subordinates, saying that during wartime, all celebratory formalities should be avoided. However, the "flavor" of the festival that could be smelled in those days was precisely because of the large packages of festival gifts seen on the streets where these formalities were practiced. However, this was, after all, a minority. Most middle-class families could not even afford to buy a few zongzi, and the public scramble for food at the markets in the East and West Fourth Memorial Archways added a considerable amount of excitement to the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival arrived. So, groups of young men and women went to participate in the long-advertised dragon boat race with great hopes. Although the number of visitors to Beihai Park was not as large as on an ordinary Sunday ten years ago, it was still quite a few. There were even two young girls wearing two sachets on their chests, reminiscent of the past glory and sparking infinite reverie. However, there was no trace of dragon boats on the waters of Taiye Pool. Many colorful decorations were hung on the Five Dragon Pavilion, which could somewhat evoke the atmosphere of the festival. It was not until 11:30, amid eager anticipation, that the sound of flutes was suddenly heard. Then, in a burst of cries of "Here they come!" a few small boats slowly crawled out from the direction of the Five Dragon Pavilion. It turned out that the so-called dragon boat races were competitions of these "unskilled" modern small boats. Each boat had two or three rowers, and no matter how strong they were, they could not row the boat very fast. Compared with the fast boats with seventy or eighty rowers, flying up and down to the sound of deafening gongs and drums, competing for the dragon head and dragon tail, these were simply a small witch seeing a great witch. Most modern propaganda is of this kind.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a citizen's carnival was also held in the newly built concert hall in Central Park, with programs including cross-talk, drums, and Beijing opera. However, the weather was too hot, which somewhat spoiled the fun. On the Beihai side, the citizen regatta also proceeded according to the original plan.</p>
<p>But outside these two parks, the atmosphere of the festival faded away. Traces of cattails and wormwood could not be found anywhere. And the sounds of beggars everywhere in the streets in the evening added a layer of gray emotion to the citizens after this "carnival."</p>
<p>The wartime Dragon Boat Festival passed like this. (Dragon Boat Festival Night)</p>

<h3>The Police Authorities of the Two Concessions Intensify Inspections of Public Places: Those Entering Without a Citizen's Certificate Will Be Questioned and Detained; Procedures for Moving Households Must Be Noted</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions believe that public places such as hotels and entertainment venues are crowded with people, and it is inevitable that unscrupulous people will mix in. Therefore, they must intensify inspections of the above-mentioned places and strengthen the special self-defense corps of each place. The authorities have now stationed personnel at the entrances of some hotels and entertainment venues in the concession to check the citizen's certificates of those entering. Those who cannot produce them will not only be absolutely prohibited from entering but will also be questioned and detained.</p>
<p>Relocation Procedures</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Baojia authorities believe that citizens either do not fully understand the relocation procedures or have neglected them over time, which has greatly affected the accuracy of household registration. Therefore, they have further clarified the various procedures. Citizens who move to other places must declare to the Baojia chief and take their citizen's certificate to the issuing police station to cancel it. For short-term travel, they can take their citizen's certificate with them, but they must also declare it to the Baojia chief. As for moving to this city, they must go through relocation procedures with the Baojia chief.</p>
<p>Immigration Procedures</p>
<p>People who move in from other places must report to the Baojia chief of the place they are moving to with a county magistrate's certificate, a good citizen certificate, or a travel permit. Only after the household registration procedures have been completed can they be issued a rationing certificate for food distribution based on the number of people. If the county magistrate's certificate or other certificates have been lost, the head of the household and the Jia chief must issue a certificate confirming that they are indeed good citizens, and the head of the household and the Jia chief must take full responsibility if any accidents occur in the future.</p>
<p>Completing Certificates</p>
<p>The Public Concession Baojia conducts spot checks of households and requires the head of the household to complete a certificate in advance, guaranteeing that there are no falsely reported people in the household and no residents without citizen's certificates. The certificate must be completed and submitted by the deadline. If it is found to be inconsistent with the household registration during the spot check, the head of the household will be punished.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Cleaning Campaign Week Begins Today: Relevant Authorities Cooperate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West district street cleaning campaign has been decided by the relevant authorities, including the Public Works Department's General Affairs Section, the Baojia Office of the district, the Police Department, the Health Bureau, and the Shanghai West Office of the bureau. All implementation methods have been determined, and the period from today to the 27th has been designated as "Shanghai West District Street Cleaning Campaign Week." The relevant authorities, in order to awaken citizens' attention to hygiene and closely assist the authorities in carrying out the street cleaning campaign, have specially printed a large number of large banners with white characters on a red background, with the words "Shanghai West Cleaning Campaign," etc. The Baojia authorities of the bureau have ordered them to go to public places such as hotels, restaurants, bars, and parks in the district, as well as busy streets and road junctions, to post them in places where pedestrians can see them. At the same time, each cleaning campaign worker will also wear a yellow "Shanghai West Cleaning Campaign" armband to show identification. This cleaning work is of great significance, so all relevant authorities are closely cooperating in order to achieve the ideal level. The Shanghai West Baojia Office will send 27 staff members to the 54 joint Bao offices in the district to supervise the citizens' cleaning work and concentrate all garbage at the locations designated by the Shanghai West Police, and then the Public Works Department will send vehicles to the garbage accumulation locations of each joint Bao to clear them out. At that time, the City Health Bureau, the Shanghai West Office of the Health Bureau, and the Shanghai West Police Department will all send personnel to supervise the citizens' efforts to clean up.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Phase of Household Sugar Distribution Is About to Be Completed</h3>
<p>The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office is about to complete the distribution of the fourth phase of household sugar. It is reported that the quantity and price of the household sugar in this phase will remain unchanged. The distribution period was originally scheduled for the 25th of this month, but it may be delayed until the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Coal for Boiled Water Shops Limited to Self-Use</h3>
<p>Since the Great China United Coal Company agreed to supply fuel to the city's hot water shops at the allocated coal price, the industry association has been handling the registration of purchases by fellow businesses. The registration period ended yesterday. After the Great China United Coal Company notifies each hot water shop, they can pay and collect the goods. This coal must not be resold for profit and is limited to self-use only. Otherwise, membership will be revoked, and allocations will be stopped.</p>
<h3>Summer Hygiene Work: Epidemics of Cholera Must Be Reported Promptly</h3>
<p>As summer approaches, epidemics are gradually emerging. In view of this, the Public Concession Baojia authorities have issued a special order to the self-defense corps members within the concession to intensify their assistance to the currency affairs personnel in promoting hygiene campaigns, maintaining local security, and protecting the health of citizens. Regarding summer hygiene, the self-defense corps members should pay attention to: (1) Strict prohibition of urination in the corners of alleys; citizens who violate this can be handed over to nearby police officers. (2) Attention to the accumulation of sewage and garbage in the gutters. (3) Attention to vendors selling unclean food and drink. (4) Urging citizens to get vaccinations as soon as possible. (5) If cholera epidemics are found in nearby areas, the self-defense corps must promptly report them to the authorities. In addition, citizens must pay attention to their health, diet, and daily life, and special attention should be paid to vaccinations. Those who have not been vaccinated will be severely punished once discovered.</p>
<h3>Tram Collision</h3>
<p>At the Bund, at the foot of the Waibaidu Bridge, at around 8:30 last night, two trams collided. One of the trailers overturned, causing five passengers in the car to suffer minor injuries. Lu Xiuxiang injured his head, Chai Changwei suffered abrasions to his left hand, Zhou Jinyuan injured his arm, Tang Zhishi injured his chest, and Zhang Tuzi injured his face. They were later taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment.</p>
<p>Also, at 2:45 yesterday afternoon, at the Kade Road Jing'an Temple Road intersection station, a tram on Route 2, due to excessive speed and stopping too abruptly, broke an axle. Fortunately, no passengers were injured.</p>
<h3>The Fifth Session of the Shenbao Scholarship Fund: Hoping for Continued Support from All Sectors; Increased School Fees and Numerous Student Applications Expected; Existing Scholarship Funds Are Still Far from the Expected Goal</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the fifth session of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund, enthusiastic individuals and schools who are concerned about out-of-school children have responded by sending letters, generously donating scholarship funds, donating free places, or holding charity exhibitions of calligraphy and painting to benefit poor students, which is deeply admired. However, it is expected that the tuition fees of various schools will increase sharply in this session, and the number of applicants will be several times that of previous sessions. Compared with the current scholarship funds of this newspaper, it is still far from the expected goal, and we still hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will continue to support us. Details of various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tingyunlou Scholarship Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition</p>
<p>Tingyunlou, an organization of Shanghai calligraphers and painters, in order to support poor students, has collected more than 2,000 pages of calligraphy, painting, and fan surfaces donated by famous calligraphers and painters from home and abroad. It will be held at the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Great New Company for three days on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th of this month. All proceeds will be donated to the scholarship funds of the Shen and Xin newspapers. All sectors are welcome to visit and purchase to support this charity.</p>
<p>Renwu Guangxia Donates School Places</p>
<p>In previous sessions of the scholarship fund organized by this newspaper, we have received donations of free school places from various schools, but there have also been donations of half-fee places or designated special methods. It has now been decided that the donation of free school places by various schools is very welcome; however, it is difficult to handle donations of half-fee places or designated methods. Yesterday, the Renwu Tutorial School donated five free places for the first grade of junior high school, and Guangxia Middle School donated two places each for the first grade of junior and senior high school.

<p>Short Comment</p>
<h3>The Chao-Shan Disaster Also Deserves Attention</h3>
<p>The Chao-Shan regions are also suffering from drought this year. Although the disaster area is not as large as that of North China, the disaster situation is equally severe. We are in the same position and naturally do not favor one over the other.</p>
<p>We have also received some reports on the Chao-Shan disaster, among which the reports from Mr. Qiang Liang and Mr. Li Xunting and other Chao-Shan fellow villagers are the most authentic. For example, "Since the beginning of this spring, there has been a long drought without rain, and the fields are all red. The price of coarse rice is more than 500 yuan per dou, and sweet potatoes are more than 10 yuan per catty, and they are not easy to buy. Middle-class families have a pale complexion, and the poor are starving to death one after another. The cholera epidemic is rampant, and the lives of the old are not guaranteed." In short, the whole article is tragic and unbearable to read.</p>
<p>We know that there are quite a few people from Chao-Shan who are doing business in Shanghai and have accumulated a wealth of assets. Secondly, Guangdong fellow villagers also occupy an important position in the industrial and commercial circles. We first hope that Chao-Shan people and Guangdong people will put in double the effort in the position of fellow villagers. We are not advocating regionalism, and of course, we also hope that all sectors will donate together. However, the well-to-do Chao-Shan people should take the lead, which is also a matter of righteousness.</p>
<p>The Social Service Department of this newspaper has long been collecting Chao-Shan disaster donations. As of now, we have collected more than 10,000 yuan, and we will continue to handle this in the future to fulfill our responsibility.</p>
<h3>Record of Sino-Japanese Calligraphy and Painting Forum Sponsored by the Japan Cultural Promotion Association</h3>
<p>The Japan International Cultural Promotion Association recently hosted a tea party to entertain Mr. Ma Gongyu, a calligrapher and painter from this city. A forum was held with Ya Chen, Wang Jichien, Xiong Songquan, Fang Huqing, Zheng Wuchang, Wang Jimei, Wu Hufan, and others, and they all expressed their opinions on the spot. Excerpts are as follows: Wu Hufan: The current exhibition held by Japan in Shanghai is very short. If China introduces its works to Japan for a short-term exhibition, the effect will definitely be minimal. Therefore, there needs to be an organization to provide long-term research in order to obtain better results.</p>
<p>Wang Jimei: I hope that the International Cultural Promotion Association can come forward to bring together Chinese and Japanese calligraphers and painters for long-term research, so that East Asian culture can be developed. Then, when exhibitions are held in the future, the results will naturally be even more remarkable.</p>
<p>Wang Jichien: I hope that in the future, more Chinese freehand paintings can be introduced to Japan, and Japan may also introduce Western painting techniques to China.</p>
<p>Wang Yachen: Painting and calligraphy have feelings and aesthetics. In the past five years, every Chinese painter has been particularly energetic in studying because of the current situation. However, this is not political power. If painting is promoted by political background, it will not be effective.</p>

<h3>Contributing Another Fundraising Method for the Urgent Relief in North China</h3>
<p>— Di Jitang</p>
<p>The disaster in North China is extremely severe, with wailing everywhere, starving people lining the roads, a heartbreaking and unbearable sight. Everyone has a compassionate heart, and all humans are moved by it. In this city, there are those who donate and raise funds for relief. Not only did Shenbao advocate for it previously, but now enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life are organizing an urgent relief association, with a heart of compassion and a sense of vigilance in times of peace, hoping to collect a large sum of money to benefit the disaster victims, which is no small feat. However, the disaster area is vast, and the number of victims is large. Although people from all walks of life are actively donating, it is feared that it will be like a drop in the bucket, making it difficult to be widespread. Therefore, it is imperative to find multiple ways to raise funds. In addition to donations and holding ball games, art exhibitions, calligraphy sales, and other events, any possible methods should be implemented simultaneously, aiming to raise as much money as possible to universally benefit the disaster victims. Therefore, I humbly offer my limited views to the gentlemen handling the relief efforts, as a supplementary method for raising funds, which is just a thought from a humble person.</p>
<p>According to a clause in the will of the late Mrs. Luo Jialing, the wife of Hardoon, states:</p>
<p>"I bequeath property worth one million yuan (according to the 1937 Shanghai Municipal Council valuation) to the Chinese government to be used as funds to enhance public welfare."</p>
<p>The aforementioned property, valued at one million yuan according to the 1937 valuation, should now be worth over ten million yuan at current market prices. Although Luo's property is enemy property, the designated portion assigned to the Chinese government for enhancing public welfare should be excluded from the scope of enemy property and handed over to the Chinese government to be used for the current North China disaster relief needs. It is believed that the Allied authorities will gladly agree. If agreement can be obtained to allow the transfer, the government can entrust the urgent relief association to sell it through public auction. In this extraordinary period, considering the Shanghai market situation in recent years, there are many buyers of real estate, so it is not difficult to raise a large sum of money, which is more reliable for disaster relief than scattered fundraising. As for how to negotiate with the authorities and how to handle the procedures, it is up to the gentlemen handling the relief efforts to discuss and implement. I hope that the officials of our government and the prominent figures of society will also find my humble suggestions acceptable. The disaster victims would be extremely fortunate!</p>
<h3>Advocating for a "One Day's Income for Relief" Movement</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yichong</p>
<p>Regardless of disaster relief funds, it is necessary to have the strength of the masses and the spirit of saving others as saving oneself, and work hard to contribute. Since the establishment of the North China Emergency Relief Association, all relief measures have been actively promoted. The citizens of this city have already donated a certain amount, but due to the vast disaster area in North China and the large number of victims, the total amount of donations in Shanghai has not yet reached two million yuan as of the current date. If distributed, the amount each victim receives may be extremely limited.</p>
<p>In order to expand the disaster relief donation movement, it is still necessary to maintain the spirit of the past and mobilize all citizens to work hard to contribute, in order to alleviate the urgent situation. Disaster relief is like putting out a fire, it must be done quickly. I suggest advocating for a "One Day's Income for Relief" movement. Whether it is companies, firms, stores, banks, educational institutions, laborers, freelance writers, theaters, entertainment venues, or other commercial and industrial organizations or individuals, all can participate by donating all of their day's business income or day's labor income to disaster relief funds. This is something that merchants would be happy to do, and it is also an easy task for individuals. It is hoped that the press will fully mobilize and expand publicity, and once again plead for the lives of the disaster victims in North China. This is deeply hoped and prayed for.

Finally, Chief Referee Koyama Ryoichi announced the start of the competition.</p>
<p>Evenly Matched</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Dalian inter-city (track and field competition) began first. The first event was the 1500-meter final. Dalian's Lai Kou was expected to win, taking the lead with a fast pace. Shanghai's Kubota also did not show weakness, following closely behind. In the last quarter of the race, he surged forward, and as he approached the finish line, Lai Kou did not give up and sprinted straight ahead, winning the championship. (Pole Vault) Dalian was expected to excel. As a result, Abe and Kido dominated, taking first and second place. (100 Meters) Dalian's Fukuda's time of 11.1 seconds was close to his usual record. Shanghai's Kimura was also extraordinary, and the competition was fierce. In the end, he lost by a fraction of a second. (Shot Put) This event could have been won by Dalian, but Shanghai's German athlete Pike and Hua Liechai competed fiercely. Pike took first place with 11.85 meters, while Dalian's Kato was defeated. (Long Jump) Dalian's Fukuda maintained 7 meters and broke the record yesterday with 7.18 meters. (400 Meters) Shanghai's Kubota, after actively training hard, was unstoppable.

Dalian's Yotsumoto was also not weak, competing with Kubota at the same time, but unfortunately fell behind by a shoulder and conceded. (Discus) Fukuda, who maintained 32 meters, regressed yesterday, and Kato won with 35.28 meters. Shanghai's Yamamoto still maintained his previous record. The famous Shanghai team's Kimura lived up to his name and dominated the event with 1.85 meters, only 0.5 meters short of his usual record. In the (5000-meter long-distance race), Shanghai's veteran Wang Zhenglin originally had hope for a silver medal, but was blocked by Dalian's Lai Kou at the start. Wang once surged past Lai Kou to take the lead, but Lai Kou quickly surged ahead. Wang retreated, and was then overtaken by Shanghai's Abe and Tominaga. In the final sprint, he finished third. Wang's even pace and fierce sprint posture won applause from the entire stadium. (Javelin) Shanghai's Hua Jiang Wang Xuewu's skills were commendable and extraordinary.

<p>Shanghai Team Wins in Soccer</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Dalian soccer match kicked off in the center of the field at 5:30 p.m. The Shanghai team concentrated the elite generals from Japan, Italy and China. Victory was already expected. However, the overall strength of the Dalian generals should not be underestimated. The only reason was the lack of contact and technical coordination in contrast to the strength of individual players on the Shanghai side, which was the fatal blow. Both goalkeepers, Shanghai's Rotti and Dalian's Wei Zhonghua, were indeed capable, doing their duty to block dangerous balls. The defense was quite strict. Dalian's entire team was shifted to a defensive stance, making it difficult for Wei Zhonghua alone to block all the balls, resulting in a one-sided situation. Shanghai's Chinese generals Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Wu Qixiang, Mai Youliang, Han Longhai, and Qu Yongfu were very active. The Japanese generals Yoda Yoshiyuki and Villaroel were also taking turns to go on the attack. In the initial stage of the match, both sides were attacking repeatedly, and the situation was quite tense. After 25 minutes, Villa opened the scoring from 30 yards out, hitting the center of the net, 1-0. Less than five minutes after Dalian conceded a goal, Wu Qixiang inserted himself in and scored another goal with a header. Then Dai Linjing scored another with a dribble. The score at halftime was 4-0, a big win for Shanghai. After the break, both sides switched positions and resumed the attack. Sun Jinshun charged straight in and scored another goal. Zhu Ji and Qu Yongfu also scored from 30 yards out, making it 6-0. At this point, Dalian became frightened and counterattacked with all their might. Tan Xueming scored a goal, breaking the duck egg and pulling back one goal. Later, Shanghai's Deipana scored another goal, making the second half score 3-1. At the end of the match, the Shanghai team won 7-1, singing triumphantly.</p>

<p>It was a quiet autumn night. There was no moon, and it was terribly dark outside the window. The sounds of the road had long faded, and only the sound of the church bell, vibrated by the west wind, carried over in bursts from afar.</p>
<p>A three- or four-year-old child lay on a small bed. In the dim light, one could see his very thin, ashen face. His constantly twitching eyebrows revealed the pain in his body. His weak breathing, or opening and closing of his lifeless eyes, indicated that he had been ill for several days.</p>
<p>The mother, with a worried face, sat diagonally on the edge of the bed. Days and nights of hard work and worry had caused her eye sockets to sink in, and her face appeared haggard and yellow. She looked anxiously at the small life on the bed, struggling with pain. When he let out a painful moan, it was as if her soul was cruelly torn apart. She watched this small life struggle in the hands of the illness, undergoing torture; she felt a thousand bullets shooting into her heart, and a thousand wild beasts dismembering her limbs. But she would rather be shot by a thousand bullets and dismembered by a thousand wild beasts than see this young soul mercilessly ravaged by illness.</p>
<p>The child's groans suddenly intensified. His eyes showed a straight light, the corners of his mouth twisted painfully, and his hands trembled constantly. The mother cried out in alarm and picked him up as if she had gone mad. At this moment, the father, who had been tossing and turning in the big bed, jumped up immediately.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with the child?"</p>
<p>"Not...good, get the medicine quickly," the mother's voice trembled terribly.</p>
<p>The father quickly took the medicine from the table and poured a glass of water.</p>
<p>The child had almost lost consciousness. As the mother fed him the medicine, tears welled up in her eyes.</p>
<p>The child seemed much better after taking the medicine. The groaning stopped, and the painful expression on his face was reduced. He lay quietly in his mother's arms.</p>
<p>"The doctor said tonight is the most dangerous time. He will be fine after it passes, but I'm afraid..." The mother's throat choked.</p>
<p>"I don't think so. He's already much better. You've worked too hard. You should rest for a moment and let me watch him," the father felt really bad seeing the mother's sallow and tired face.</p>
<p>"No, no, you go to sleep. You still have to write tomorrow. I'll call you if the child gets worse."</p>
<p>"You haven't slept for several nights. Look at your face, you have to take care of yourself."</p>
<p>"No, no, I don't... it doesn't matter. He's quiet now, so let him rest for a while."</p>
<p>The child fell asleep in his mother's arms, partly helped by the medicine and partly for comfort.</p>
<p>The late autumn night was particularly desolate and terrifying. The croaking of insects sounded like the wailing of ghosts in the barren mountains. A gust of wind blew, causing the window to rattle, like a demon knocking on the door. The sound of rustling leaves, mixed with a dog barking from afar and the sound of the church bell, wove together a mournful symphony.</p>
<p>The father, exhausted from the day's work, had fallen asleep. The two older sisters in the bed over there were also sound asleep. The mother sat blankly on the edge of the bed, holding the child. Only the clock on the opposite wall, ticking away, seemed to be her only companion. Yet it was also her judge, the one on whom all her hopes rested. As long as its hands moved one more minute, the child's period of danger would decrease by one minute, and her worries would be reduced by one minute.</p>
<p>When the child's face showed a painful expression, she seemed to see death grinning at her triumphantly. She trembled and held the poor little life tightly, constantly praying silently, begging heaven to allow her to sacrifice herself in any way to exchange for the safety of this small life. She kept holding the child, not daring to put him down, partly because she was afraid he would be uncomfortable, and partly because there was a nameless terror in her heart, as if he would be snatched away from her arms as soon as he left her arms, never to return.</p>
<p>The clock did not seem to heed her prayers and moved especially slowly. The sun in the east also seemed not to have heard her prayers and was late in showing its face. But the child's condition was very good. Except for a few times when he wanted a drink of water, he had been sleeping very peacefully. The mother felt a little relief in her heart, but at the same time, she also felt a wave of uncontrollable fatigue. Days and nights of hard work had depleted all her energy. But it was always difficult to sleep while holding the child, and she also didn't dare to sleep. She thought that if she fell asleep, the child would be snatched away by death immediately. She had no choice but to force herself to straighten her aching waist, widen her powerless eyes, and support herself minute by minute for an unknown length of time. Finally, she felt the scene in front of her gradually turn pitch black, and her whole body seemed to scatter like dust. The things in the room all became dim. Suddenly she saw that the child's illness had been cured, and he was as innocent and lively as usual, running around the room. Just as she was about to rejoice, a demonic hand suddenly reached in from outside the window, reaching for the child. The mother was shocked and frantically hugged the child tightly. She woke up to realize it was a dream. The child was still sleeping very quietly in his mother's arms, and the east had already faintly revealed a patch of gray-white color.</p>
<p>"Thank you, heavens, for protecting the child and helping him through this night." The mother looked at the gray-white sky in the east, and then at the child's small face, and tears almost welled up in her eyes.</p>
<p>Following the morning light reflected through the window, she looked at her husband sleeping soundly in bed. His thin, dark face was etched with wrinkles, a gift from the burden of supporting the whole family and the illness of his children. She also looked at the two daughters over there, still lingering in beautiful dreams. Milk-white arms pressed against the black hair. Pink cheeks were printed under the closed eyes, making them look even more innocent and lovely. She also saw her own withered hands and breasts, sucked dry by the child. Where was her youth? Where were the tender, slender hands of her girlhood? The full breasts? The slender figure? The tender cheeks that had been carefully shielded from the sun with a handkerchief? She remembered what her husband had said to her last night.</p>
<p>"You've worked too hard, you should rest for a moment."</p>
<p>"Look at your face, you have to take care of yourself."</p>
<p>She felt a pang of pain in her heart, but it disappeared immediately. The sunlight had already penetrated the window curtain and shone on the apple-like faces of the two daughters and the very quiet face of the sick child, showing a comfortable smile.</p>
<p>"Yes, for them, I don't matter." The mother felt supreme comfort.</p>
<h3>On the Creators of "New Literature"</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yuan</p>
<p>Recently, several articles discussing the issue of "New Literature" have been published in "The Magazine." These articles thoroughly examine and critique the content, form, style, and tone of current "New Literature" creations, offering many valuable insights. However, they all focus on minor details of creation, without addressing the creators of "New Literature" themselves. Now, I will briefly discuss what I have observed.</p>
<p>Generally, the creation of an excellent work—whether it belongs to the category of "New Literature" or "Old Literature"—requires practical experience as its foundation. Imagining everything from scratch, without any basis, will likely not produce good writing. It is said that before Zhao Ziang exhausted his representations of horses, he locked himself in a room, looking up and down, leaping and jumping, first performing many horse-like movements and postures, only then could he paint horses with vivid spirit. Émile Zola, in order to write about the lives of workers, went himself to experience life among them. Cao Yu, the author of "Sunrise," reportedly frequented the Eight Great Hutongs for a month or two to understand the inner workings of brothels. From this, we can see that genuine impressions are necessary to write substantial works.</p>
<p>Looking back at many current creators of "New Literature," they spend all day deep within their ivory towers—or, more accurately, in pigeonhole-style garret rooms—leading empty lives with limited experience. They cannot write groundbreaking masterpieces, nor even articles that are slightly rich in meaning and genuinely reflect life. Thus, as Mr. Zhe Fei said, they can only meaninglessly shout about things like "dreams of lilac flowers," "the sorrows of nightingale elegies," and "the purity of lilies," while the objects they describe are merely the lips of dancers, the throats of singers, and non-existent lovers. As for lilacs, nightingales, and lilies, they probably haven't even seen what they look like, even in their dreams.</p>
<p>Perhaps some might sigh and say, "We don't want to write articles with more meaningful content and more positive viewpoints, but we can't ignore the current environment." In fact, this reason is extremely insufficient. A person who truly understands the art of "creation" can express things that others dare not say or write, using clever metaphors, subtle and roundabout techniques, indirect allusions, and methods of "setting off the moon with clouds," allowing readers to understand implicitly without violating the taboos of the environment. Moreover, besides those "sorrowful gray systems," "desert-like loneliness," "desperate souls," or streamlined multiple love affairs, the "flowers in the wind and moon" of the 20th century, and the romances of modern talented men and beautiful women under rose bushes, are there no other materials that can be used? If our "New Literature" creators can step out of their ivory towers, walk onto the crossroads of life, and use their eyes to see, their ears to hear, and their brains to think, then in this arena of life's review, from the internal unrest of society and the agitation of the working masses to the curses of vendors and the weeping of newspaper boys, everywhere there are inexhaustible subjects. If not, then writing about one's own familiar and experienced daily sights and trivial matters would be more intimate and moving than those mirages, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>However, even with the rich, complex, and unparalleled life experiences like those of Maxim Gorky, lacking the ability to extract information, refine essence, and organize, arrange, and synthesize the material from that practical experience, it is still futile. Soldiers returning from the trenches cannot all become Henri Barbusse or Erich Maria Remarque, just as sons of wealthy and noble families cannot all become Cao Xueqin or Leo Tolstoy. Merely having experience does not necessarily lead to the creation of excellent "New Literature." Then, are talent and spirit innate? Those "genius theorists" say that creation requires something like "inspiration," so they don't think about anything and wait for inspiration to arrive. They drink a little wine, planning to, like Van Gogh, become impulsively hysterical and smear paint on the canvas. They also bring paper and pens to the park, wanting to learn from Beethoven, who carried paper with musical staff lines and would compose whenever inspiration struck. But after waiting a long time, there is no trace of inspiration... From this, it seems that while genius cannot be said to be completely non-existent, wanting to create solely based on genius is an extremely childish and laughable matter. Thomas Edison repeatedly told young people that "success" is made up of one part "inspiration" mixed with nine parts "perspiration." If a spark exists in the body but is not connected with effort, then this spark cannot be promoted and expanded to burn across the wilderness!</p>
<p>The so-called "perspiration" and "effort," for a creator engaged in "New Literature," refer to the continuous cultivation accumulated over time. As for the methods of cultivation, of course, there are only reading more, writing more, thinking more, and critiquing more. A creator must possess three particularly long organs: first, the eyes of a scientist; second, the brain of a philosopher; and third, the hands of an artist. The reason for needing the eyes of a scientist is for observation, the reason for needing the brain of a philosopher is for speculation, and the reason for needing the hands of an artist is for the techniques of expression in creation.</p>
<p>But in terms of the standpoint of creation, the refinement of style is far less important than the cultivation of thought. Indeed, beautiful writing and ornate rhetoric are necessary conditions for a writer. Although the carving of words and phrases is a trivial skill, which Han Yu was ashamed to use as an actor's makeup, if one does not pay attention to rhetoric, even with substantial ingenuity, it cannot be instilled into the reader's heart. However, style is only form, and thought is content. Style is like rouge and powder, and thought is like a beautiful woman. With a beautiful woman, adding rouge and powder will make her even more beautiful. If you are truly beautiful, then even without rouge and powder, you will not lose your beauty. But if you are not a beauty, using rouge and powder will only make you look ugly! We would rather listen to a mountain song than read a "Rhapsody on Hunting," a congratulatory preface, or a certain person's epitaph, because the former is genuine and emphasizes emotion, while the latter merely emphasizes official style and wears a mask. Anything that is not "true" is not "real," and there is no question of "beauty."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, it reminds me of the criticisms that some supporters of "Old Literature" make of "New Literature." They say that many current "New Literature" works are either too immature or "protracted and muddled," "circuitous and evasive," "too thick to dissolve"... This is undeniable. However, they are unwilling to calmly think that the development of "New Literature" is only a matter of the recent decades since the "May Fourth Enlightenment Movement." It is currently in the stage of sprouting and growing. "Old Literature," with thousands of years of history, still has many shortcomings, let alone this newborn infant. But in just these few decades, it has already produced so many groundbreaking masterpieces, esteemed and loved by tens of millions of progressives, and has become widely popular among the broad masses. Therefore, the expansion and flourishing of its future, bright and splendid, is not difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Therefore, we sincerely hope that every creator engaged in "New Literature" will live earnestly, learn continuously, and write solemnly, so as not to fail the mission entrusted by the times.</p>
<h3>Father's Eyes Are Open</h3>
<p>— Tian Qi Zhong Tao</p>
<p>Father: It has been nine months since you went to another world. It was on the evening of September 12th last year, at half past eight, a late autumn night. Because it was the countryside, the surroundings were frighteningly quiet. My mother, siblings, and I sat by your bed, accompanying you. Your expression was very peaceful at that time: you were staring at us with your eyes wide open. Were you feeling that you were about to leave us, and therefore trying your best to find a glimmer of hope among us? I don't know. Slowly, your limbs grew cold, your heart stopped beating, but your eyes remained wide open, unable to close. Father! You were worried: afraid that we would not be able to stand on our own in society! Ah, Father! Mother and siblings wailed loudly, but at that time, I didn't cry, nor did I feel anything. I was just dazed. I stared blankly at your body, lying on the bed but never moving again. I felt that life and death were too mysterious, and the distance between them was so close, like crossing a threshold. The night was very thick. Mother, exhausted from crying, had already fallen asleep. A bean oil lamp was lit beside the bed, and the wind in the courtyard threatened the flame, shaking the bamboo, making a rustling sound.</p>
<p>Father! You had no property in this world, but you had several children, two of whom were already adults (my elder brother and I), with no achievements; two were still in childhood, precisely at the stage where education was needed; a daughter was not yet married, and I was not yet married. The responsibility was quite heavy. You were very ill, lying in bed, thinking of this, you said: "If I can live for another ten years, the education and marriage of my children can be roughly settled, and I will be at ease. Just ten years..." But you were ultimately killed by the disease. In the final moment, you were unwilling, still wanting to struggle a bit. Your eyes were wide open; you were afraid that your children would suffer; you were so distressed that tears fell! Father, you left us, and we are living in hardship, just as you imagined!</p>
<p>Ah, I dare not think further. Father! Among your children, you loved me comparatively more, and you placed deep hopes on me; but what about now? The result of my years of struggle is that I am not as good as a clerk in a small shop, I am not as good as a tea servant, a worker—no, I am simply worse than a beggar! I have no enjoyment in material terms, no comfort in spirit; I live lonely years in solitude. So I watch plays, drink wine; I want to numb my painful nerves. Father! I no longer think about effort, I no longer demand success, I just pass the days muddledly. But when I think of your open eyes—ah, I am reminded of my mother's happiness, my younger brother's education, my younger sister's marriage, my own future, I cannot suppress my emotions, I feel my heart aching like a pattern, I am so wasted, I am letting you down—Father, am I worthy of you? I can only cry, cry, until exhaustion takes me into sleep...</p>
<p>Father, you often taught us: do not seek unrighteous money, and you said that wealth obtained by improper means will not last long. So you ran education for a lifetime, helping local administration, and were still very poor. You did not complain at all; you only encouraged us to strive to acquire a skill for self-reliance, and you would be at ease. When you were financially well-off, you always gave it to the poor; when eating, you often gave food to beggars. You said: "Giving what is surplus to others is the best thing, do not be stingy." Ah, Father, when you yourself only ate porridge, you still saved a little to give to others, how compassionate your heart was! You were unwilling to speculate, and how honest you were! Those you usually saw were a group of villagers without status or knowledge, but you were very kind to them, and they respected you very much; they knew you were seriously ill, and often asked: "Is he any better?" When they heard the news of your death, none of them did not sigh! Father, you were too good, the impression you gave me, I will never forget; not only in the painful and miserable present, but in the future, in the last moment before my death, I will still not forget your kindness!</p>
<p>Father! My son's mood is extremely disturbed now. I am thinking of you, I am experiencing all the injustices of the world, ah, I can't bear it anymore, I really want to commit suicide! But, you are staring at me with your eyes wide open, and in this gaze there is sorrow, entreaty, hope, unease, horror, all kinds of emotions, which shake my thoughts of death; is there anything more painful than a life that has no interest in living but cannot die? I wander, wander on the road of life and death. Father! Forgive me! I cannot continue your career, I cannot fulfill your hopes, I no longer have the courage to live! Moreover, I just want to be with you...</p>
<p>Father! When I hear others mention their fathers, I miss you; at night, I miss you; when I have a little free time during the day, I often think of you; as soon as I think of you, I only feel heartbroken, and tears can't help but flow down. Ah, Father! I don't know what to do! I cannot solve the realities of the world, I cannot let go of my grief for you, I hope you will tell me in a dream! Father! Please tell me, I am your pitiful son!</p>

<h3>Commentary: Amending the Central Reserve Bank Law</h3>
<p>On the 14th of this month, the National Government announced amendments to the Central Reserve Bank Law, with the following key points regarding issuance:</p>
<p>(1) The maximum amount of Central Reserve notes to be issued shall be approved by the National Government.</p>
<p>(2) Central Reserve notes shall be issued in five denominations: one, five, ten, fifty, and one hundred yuan, and may also issue decimal fractional notes.</p>
<p>(3) The reserve for Central Reserve notes shall be at least 40% cash reserve, with the remainder secured by securities issued or guaranteed by the National Government, domestic bank acceptances, drafts, checks, domestic commercial drafts, and drafts payable abroad.</p>
<p>(4) The cash reserve for Central Reserve notes shall be divided into two types: (1) silver coins and raw gold and silver, and (2) foreign currency and foreign currency deposits.</p>
<p>(5) The Central Reserve note reserve shall be fully transparent, and the amount issued and the amount of the reserve shall be published weekly.</p>
<p>After reading the above five points in the new Central Reserve Bank Law, we feel greatly pleased, because: (1) according to the first point, the issuance of Central Reserve notes will henceforth have a maximum limit, to reassure people; (2) according to the second point, there will be no more rumors of the issuance of 500 large notes in the market; (3) according to the third point, Central Reserve notes will henceforth maintain at least 40% cash reserve, and the amount issued will be limited in an invisible way; (4) according to the fourth point, part of the cash reserve of Central Reserve notes will be deposited in friendly countries, and from this we can infer that the new gold production of friendly countries may help stabilize the value of Central Reserve notes; (5) according to the fifth point, the amount of Central Reserve notes issued and the amount of the reserve will be re-published weekly as in the past, to gain public trust.</p>
<h3>Municipal Economic Bureau Stipulates Measures for Registering and Transferring Major Commodities</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau, in accordance with the provisions of the Ministry-promulgated Major Commodities Registration Rules, has specially drafted the Shanghai Special Municipal Measures for Registering and Reporting the Transfer of Major Commodities.

The measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>Registration of Major Commodities</p>

(4) In registering major commodities, the type, name, quantity, source, value at the time of acquisition, packaging method, or storage location of the commodity, as well as the brand name, business location, name, address, and date of completion of the commodity owner and applicant, must be filled in separately and in detail. (5) Members of all trade associations who store, buy, or manufacture the various major commodities listed in Article 1 may have their registration applied for by the trade association on their behalf.

<p>Procedures for Reporting Transfers</p>

(14) If there is a change or reduction in the quantity of major commodities after registration by the Bureau, and a report is not submitted in accordance with the procedures, strict penalties will be imposed upon verification.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations Establish Evaluation Committees</h3>
<p>Various trade associations in this city, in order to comply with the orders of the authorities, have been reorganized and established one after another. To take things a step further, starting from the beginning of this month, they have successively launched the establishment of evaluation committees for various trade associations. These committees have now been established one after another. All committee members are naturally the directors and supervisors of the respective trade associations, with the chairman of the board serving as the chairman of the committee. Additionally, individuals with outstanding talent and broad knowledge within the trade are hired as consultants to provide opinions and serve as evaluation material at any time. The organizational system is quite simple, mostly consisting of (1) an assessment section, (2) an investigation section, (3) an allocation section, and (4) a procurement section. Simultaneously, a research committee is established to study issues such as the adjustment of commodity prices, the stability of the commercial market, and the improvement of production efficiency.</p>
<p>Observing and Establishing Rules</p>
<p>For the convenience of promoting the work of the various evaluation committees, regulations that members of the trade should abide by have been established. The main points are as follows: (1) The price limits for goods of all grades evaluated and determined by the committee must be observed by the trade members. They must sell according to the limits and are not allowed to disobey openly and comply secretly, or sell above the set prices in secret. (2) Engaging in black market transactions or illegal activities such as speculation is prohibited. Any member of the trade who knows of such situations must report directly to the committee for punishment according to the law. (3) Monthly (or every ten days), a report form, in duplicate, must be filled out and submitted to the committee for record. This form should include the following items: A. Name of the business; B. Address; C. Nature of the business; D. Total value of existing goods; E. Quantity sold; F. Quantity of goods purchased; G. Business conditions. (4) Various goods are limited to being sold to legitimate users only and may not be resold to vendors or merchants outside the trade for profit.</p>
<p>Punishments for Violating Regulations</p>
<p>(5) Any items sold in retail stores should be marked with the price limits evaluated and determined by the committee. The size of the characters and the style of the labels should be limited to what is stipulated by the authorities and must be placed in a prominent location so that every customer can easily see and distinguish them clearly. (6) The measuring instruments used must meet the standards. Forgery, or being too long or too short, or too big or too small, is strictly prohibited. (7) Purchases of various goods must be recorded in a register for future inspection by the authorities and the committee investigators at any time. If such a situation occurs, the account books should be presented promptly without any other excuses. (8) The allocated goods must not be concealed and refused to be sold, so as not to confuse people. (9) It is strictly forbidden to reduce the quality or quantity for profit. Regardless of whether the customer is old, young, male, or female who wants to buy any kind of item, the item should be shown and the price limit should be told, without any deception. (10) If any of the above items are violated, they will be punished according to the law, or sued in court. No leniency will be shown.</p>
<p>Responsible for Promoting Evaluation</p>
<p>Thereafter, in addition to selling according to the limits, if members of the trade need to adjust the selling price slightly due to cost considerations, they must submit a cost sheet in advance, filling in the type of goods, the current market price, and the purchase price in detail. At the same time, the name of the business, the name of the representative, the name of the manager, and the detailed address must be written clearly. After the detailed price committee receives the cost sheet, it will be submitted to the evaluation meeting for lengthy discussion, and then handed over to the investigation section for investigation. After that, a document will be sent to the relevant authorities for approval. Only after the authorities approve can the new price limit be sold at. Otherwise, no changes can be made. As for the distribution and purchase of goods, it is hoped that the relevant authorities will supervise and assist, and that all members of the trade will contribute opinions at any time to promote public welfare.</p>
<h3>Six Items Such as Steel Will Establish a Control Association</h3>
<p>In order to meet the needs, the relevant authorities are now planning to include six items, including steel, machinery, non-ferrous metals, wood, rubber, and chemical products, into a unified control organization. Currently, the control organizations for steel, machinery, and non-ferrous metals have been completed, and the control organization matters for wood, rubber, and chemical products are currently under review by the relevant authorities and will be finalized soon.</p>
<p>Cement Incorporated into Chemical Products</p>
<p>Cement for construction is also an important material for the war effort. In view of the increasing demand, in addition to the relevant parties actively procuring and manufacturing raw materials for cement, such as limestone, coal stone, and gypsum, to facilitate mass production, it has been decided to include organizations related to the production and sale of cement in the chemical products department for unified control.</p>
<h3>Hua Yi No. 1 Vessel Held Launching Ceremony Yesterday - Allied Nation Lieutenant Colonel Nakajo Attended in Person</h3>

At present, the promotion of material exchange and transportation is of utmost importance. In addition, the general manager Yao Runhua and engineer Chen Shiying, who are employed by the company, are both former specialized technicians from the Jiangnan Shipyard and have rich experience. Therefore, the company's contribution to the future of the shipbuilding industry will be great.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Office of the Metal Industry Federation is ready, and it is scheduled to convene an inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 23rd) at No. 150 Hong Kong Road. All registered iron and steel, machinery, and hardware trade associations in various regions must send representatives to attend on time.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Stack Industry Trade Association was ordered by the Economic Bureau to reorganize within a time limit, renaming itself as the Shanghai Special City Warehouse Industry Trade Association. Geng Xuekun, Zhuang Zhiyao, and others were designated as responsible conveners to establish it soon. All those engaged in warehouse business or part-time warehouse business in this city must apply to the trade association for registration before the 25th.</p>
<p>The Regional Egg Industry Trade Associations and the Japanese Egg Industry Joint Venture Company decided to establish a Sino-Japanese Egg Merchant Friendship Association, with Lu Boqi as the Secretary-General. Following the instructions of the Business and Trade Unification Association, it is also recommended to establish an Egg Industry Professional Committee, with Zhou Zizhuan as the Secretary-General. It is stipulated that from the 10th of this month, members who have goods arriving in Shanghai without being appointed by the trade association to purchase them will be considered private goods and will be punished according to the charter of the trade association.</p>
<p>In order to solve the problem of raw materials, the printing ink manufacturing industry in this city is currently organizing the Shanghai Printing Ink Industry Association. The organizational content has been applied to the authorities. It is reported that once the association is established, unified measures will be taken regarding the raw materials for manufacturing printing ink, such as pigments, mineral oil, rosin, and the sale of products.</p>
<p>Fu Min Dairy Company started production and delivery in October of this year. The original capital was 2 million yuan, which was approved for registration and held a license. This spring, due to business expansion, an additional 3 million yuan of capital was added, totaling 5 million yuan. The products include two types of milk powder, namely white tower and powdered milk, to meet the needs of the industry.

<h3>Saying that the Central Reserve Bank Will Issue 500-Yuan Notes - There is No Provision in the Constitution</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a widespread rumor that the Central Reserve Bank will issue banknotes with a face value of 500 yuan, causing public anxiety, believing that this move will easily stimulate the market. However, according to sources with inside information consulted by reporters from Guofeng News Agency, there is no legal basis for this statement. The amended Central Reserve Bank Law promulgated on the 14th of this month, Article 19, states that the bank can issue exchangeable notes in five denominations: one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan. According to the latest laws and regulations, there is no provision for the issuance of 500-yuan banknotes, so the above rumors are hard to believe for the time being.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Liaison Association Holds General Membership Meeting Today</h3>

The association will also hold a farewell party at that time, and the enthusiastic atmosphere is foreseeable.</p>
<h3>Commercial and Trade Unification Association and Sino-Japanese Economic Relations (1)</h3>
<p>— Toraji Kuriki</p>
<p>The advancement of Japan's policy toward China is the most significant manifestation of putting policy into practice. The first thing that should be mentioned is that under Chinese sovereignty, China's controlled economy is about to develop successfully. Moreover, this work is entrusted to Chinese civilians, which is indeed a groundbreaking initiative. The Commercial and Trade Unification Association established this time is an organization with such characteristics. The function of the Commercial and Trade Unification Association can be said to be the central nervous system of the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>Using this form of autonomous controlled economy to handle the Chinese economy is probably the first time in Chinese history. Therefore, the success or failure of the autonomous controlled economy still depends on future results. However, in terms of the significance of China's independent participation in the war, the Chinese people, no matter what difficulties they encounter, must take responsibility for completing this important task in order to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War. This is especially true for Japanese economic people in China. In short, we will not hesitate to join hands with Chinese economic people and do our best to help China establish a controlled economy, which is also our duty.</p>
<p>Since the local Japanese residents participate in the Commercial and Trade Unification Association as the lower-level organization, Japanese people should make full use of their special skills or knowledge gained from years of experience to achieve common goals.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle of the Commercial and Trade Unification Association is that it is a public welfare institution belonging to Chinese sovereignty. Therefore, the regulations on its operation are entirely handled by the Chinese, which is an extremely fair and wise measure. We are sincerely pleased with this, and it is also due to the wise measures taken by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. This fact, along with Japan's abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions, can be said to be proof of Japan's practice of its policy toward China. In other words, this proves that Japan's policy toward China is not just empty talk. It always respects China's sovereignty, and all issues between China and Japan start from this point of view. This time, it has been realized economically and politically, and it can be considered that the stage of implementing Sino-Japanese equality has been reached.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chinese officials and civilians must also strive to implement this point with the same understanding as the Japanese. Chairman Tang has repeatedly explained the important mission of the Commercial and Trade Unification Association. He also spoke very clearly in his instructions to the staff of the Commercial and Trade Unification Association and its lower-level organizations. However, I would like to emphasize it a little bit here and look forward to the Commercial and Trade Unification Association. (To be continued)</p>
