<p>社評</p>
<h3>糧價下跌與物價反漲</h3>
<p>我們今天再提出物價問題，也許有人說：「物價！物價！聽得太多了。辦法儘管說得怎樣周密，還是得不到事實的反響。」然而，我們始終認爲當前的物價問題，是最關民生的重大問題。惟其因爲得不到事實的反響，就更應透澈的討論，務必得到合理的解決。這綫是與論界的責任。</p>
<p>在本月二日的社評中曾說：『我們曾經說過，也可以說，大多數人都同樣說過，糧食問題爲物價問題的中心，一般物價的漲落，常隨糧價爲轉移：可是，目前的事實，並不能證實這一論斷，因爲糧價已在下跌了，而別的物價並不隨之下跌。』三日的社評中又說：『就最近的趨勢而言，糧價是跌了，而別種物價一部分還在漲，幾年來爲了物價高漲而成了「驚弓之鳥」的大衆們，心弦上籠罩着「糧價也許就要回漲」的暗影，其實大可不必顧慮這一點，我們應該研究如何制止一部分物價上漲的辦法，才。是有意義的出路。』今天我們想把這兩段話爲中心，申述一些意見：</p>
<p>第一，過去一般物價，是不是隨着糧價上漲呢？可說絕對是的。勞力者說：要吃飽了飯，才可以工作，所以糧價漲，就要增加工資；工業生產者說：因爲工資增加，原料增價，所以製成品也要加價。市塲販賣者說：因爲批貨加價，如以低價售出，高價補進，即須虧本，所以要漲價。在糧價高漲時，就沒有理田抑制其他物價亦步亦趨。所以，我們當時在根本上要求抑制糧價，而穩定其他物價，這也可以說同情糧食以外的其他物價的上漲。可是，自從戶口米的增加，搬運限制的調整以後，糧價開始在上月中旬下跌了，而且跌的比率相當大，那末，旣然承認一切物價隨糧價上漲，也就沒有理由說不能隨糧價下跌，所以，目前糧價已跌，而其他物價不跌反漲的現象，是不合理的，必須設法加以制止。</p>
<p>第二，我們雖則說『糧價也許就要回漲』的話，不必顧慮。母寗是安定一般心理的成分比較多。如果不即設法限制其他物價的上漲，因此刺激糧價的回漲，自然也是很可能的事。在某種人爲的惡劣形勢裏，常會歪曲經濟的道理，事實的邏輯的。我們過去已經受够了糧價高漲的苦痛，再不能仟令復活，所以必須愼防一般物價不隨糧價而跌的惡現象，可以產生刺激糧價再漲的反作用。</p>
<p>第三，大凡一部分持有貨物者的心理，以爲糧價漲，我的貨物也可以漲，這輩人受不到糧價的威脅，壓根兒不重視糧價的高漲，歷年高物價的環境，造成了他們「混水撈魚』，『幸災樂禍』的根性，趁機會落得賺錢，彼此觀望，你漲我也漲，你不跌我也不跌，我們爲了安定大衆生活着想，對於這種心理，非設法打破不可。</p>
<p>第四，我們强調現階段物價問題，在於一部分心理恐慌和心理不良，造成漲價賽跑的現象。可以作一個比喻：「譬如戲院失了火，大家手忙脚亂，擠在門內不敢外出，只要有人大聲疾呼，退後三步，把門打開，大家魚貫而出，一定都可得救。』所以，我們也期待漲價賽跑的商人們，也能退後三步，爲大家求出路哩！</p>
<p>我們認爲合理調整當前一般物價，最適當的辦法，是實施「全面限價」。而且已經到了不能不急迫實施的階段了。至於限價的標準，具體的說：「限價應以糧價爲標準』。一切物價價率，應根據三月中旬糧價最高時爲藍本，然後依照糧價的比率，隨之遞降。除因原料與器材不易取得，成本確實　加者，作爲特例，但也須嚴格考查外，必須遵守這一原則。此外，自然需要多方面顧慮周到，斟情酌理，以期公平合理。</p>
<p>最後，我們是坐而言者，亟盼政府各有關部門，迅速起而行。深信這個最關民生的重大問題，一定會得到廣大民衆的擁護和協力的。</p>

<h3>英向印度提出　白皮書的眞相</h3>
<p>關於印度政策，英首相邱吉爾與印度事務大臣阿利美等的無力無能，英國政界對之，頗　不滿，甚至連美　的言論機關，也一齊加以非難。爲應付此種不滿和非難，印度政廳乃於三月廿四日發表誹謗甘地及國民會議派之長言文件，倫敦印度事務部，亦於同日下午十一時，發表白皮書，全文長達五萬言。該白皮書之目的，不外在於爲了甘地與國民會議派等，斷乎反抗英國施於印度之積年的壓制政策，決意向着實現所謂「完全的自由」邁進之故，印度政廳對之，除將會議派視爲叛逆分子而爲徹底的對付外，別無懷柔政策可言之旨，加以力說而已。尤其是因着甘地的絕食，印度總督林里斯哥對於英國政界及其他反軸心陣營內的進步派等所提關於無條件釋放之要求，置之不理的結果，致邱吉爾的印度政策正遭到論難之際，印度政廳視甘地之要求爲「暴動」，乃圖在英國民之前，力說其除加鎭壓之外，別無他策，以爲自已辯護，爲其主要目的。然而由於此次白皮書的發表，吾人便不能不認爲英國政府，鑒於以甘地及國民會議派爲領袖之印度民衆的反英抗爭，已趨於熾烈化而且軸心化的事實，而肆其悲鳴。</p>
<p>英國此次的對印白皮書，於其最後，仍以向例的手法，根據分割統治的政策，而提及回敎徒，學生等並未參加騷擾啦，勞動團體比較的保持「自制」啦，等等的訴說，可是這些不過是其歪曲印度實情的濫言，顯然與其白皮書的前半相矛盾。總之，這次英國政府對於印度所加較前更爲强暴之帝國主義的壓迫，意欲把印度永遠淪爲英國的殖民地，這種非人道的野心，因着這次白皮書的發表，已明白暴露出來了。該白皮書的內容如左：</p>
<p>白皮書的內容</p>
<p>甘地於一九四二年四月十九日，公然對英政府提出自印度撤退的要求，嗣後至八月七日會議派委員在孟買舉行會議以前，會議派的最高司令部或該派的組織全體，有計畫地準備民衆運動的基礎，其究極目的，則企圖把印度由英國的統治而解放。又甘地雖被視爲非暴力運動的源泉，然彼固熟知印度人民大衆畢竟不能實踐非暴力運動者。甘地及會議派中之甘地門徒，每述及會議派的運動樣式時，必以非暴力運動爲說，這不外是敬虔的希望而已。</p>
<p>嗣後甘地曾官稱：「英國人的駐在印度，無異對日本軍請求其侵入印度，故英國人之退出印度，實爲先決問題。」其後甘地似已同意於反軸心國軍隊駐屯於印度國內，然而成爲其提案基礎之二個根木的動機，却不能等閑看過。第一就是希望最後把印度由英國的支配而解放，第二就是希望無論如何印度必須避免成爲日英兩國實際戰鬥的戰塲。不用說，甘地自身固亦不信僅以非暴力遝動而能防禦印度，然而更完全不相信反軸心　能　在印度防禦日本軍。更進一步考之，假定甘地與會議派諸人有望於反軸心軍具有防衛印度之力，但甘地自身還是宣　着反軸心軍能否有效的作戰，須由糾成適當的臨時政權或其他而定。然而如斯的臨時政權，似完全爲站於敗北主義的見地之一派所支配，而該派的指導者，不是已經聲明業已有與日本政府交涉的準備嗎？</p>
<p>會議派領袖咸謂唯在英國瀕於危險之際，會議派方有達成年來目的之機會，並相信在反軸心國命運瀕於累卵之危的形勢尚未一轉之間，必須抓住會議派實現政治要求的機會，這能够否認嗎？</p>
<p>如果檢討甘地的演說及其論文，則旣於七月之前，已堅定其最後鬥爭的决意；如果引用甘地自身的話，則早已沒有退却餘地，也沒有交涉餘地。即已經沒有再給一次機會以觀後效的問題。總之，甘地所企圖之運動，是「公然的叛逆」，是「縱令付出任何犧牲，也是爲要把行於印度的外國支配，從此使其告終的鬥爭，是最後的鬥爭。」他企圖非武裝的叛亂；他預期於短期內迅速而且確實地把印度全國投入於大火之中，其間實行暴動；更於必要時，甚至有實行指揮總罷業的決心。</p>
<p>甘地的鬥爭計畫，預想着非暴力大運動的一切手段，舉凡罷業，攔斷鐵路等等，更進而企圖妨害英軍的移動，尤其是企圖儘量活用現在印度人間對於英國的不滿。八月九日拂曉，甘地與其他會議派領袖，在孟買被捕，同時在印度全國，有力的會議派領袖，咸被檢舉。然被捕之會議派領袖，其總數未出九百。嗣後會議派即不絕主張其詞，謂此次之騷擾，實起因於印度政廳的彈壓；然而此次騷擾以來，政廳之最初動手，僅爲以上一齊檢舉的一事耳。</p>
<p>上述檢舉時在瑪得拉斯省，孟買省，比哈爾省，中央省，以及聯合省等各地，均發生騷擾，而且損害範圍極廣，所用特殊的器具與事前未爲準備而突如其來的暴行，實有不堪想像者。更徵諸多數的實例，則可知此等破壞工作，實有着許多技術的知識爲基礎。例如對於鐵路施行破壞工作之際，特以閉塞機及轉轍室等爲目標，同樣，其技術上的巧妙，無論於選擇攻擊目標，或於實施攻擊方法，無不可以再三窺見。又其發生最大騷擾的地區，同時亦爲軍事上極重要之地，此則更不能　閑看過。例如在印度煤礦業中心地，乃至於日本軍攻擊上曝露最著的地方之直接背後，廢生騷擾。</p>
<p>假定煤的供給停止，則印度的運輸業及一般工業，即陷於麻痺狀態。如果使位於印度東岸之防軍的後方連絡，發生破綻，則沒有再比這更佳的攻擊目標。不過在會議派領袖被捕的最初一星期間，在阿薩姆，奧利薩，判查布，以及西北國境省等諸省，重大的騷擾比較爲少。而且發生騷擾之區，參加的學生團，從無例外，僅限於印度敎徒的學生，他們常爲騷擾的先鋒。這次的暴行，是不能視爲單純的暴徒之暴行的。又這次的騷擾，回敎徒差不多沒有參加，勞動大衆亦除屈於政治的壓迫者外，大體保持「自制」。</p>
<p>大衆暴動的第一階段告終時，新的三種傾向同時明白。第一就是本格的非暴力，非軍事不服從運動的表現，第二就是重大犯罪的發生，第三就是轉向於恐怖行動。</p>
<p>放火，念業，以及對於官吏的殘殺，暴行等，相繼發生，在孟買省，聯合省，中央省等地，已至發生了炸彈事件。此等暴行，最初雖未見有重大的效果，然嗣後卽急速呈現技術的改善，到了運動開始後第十二星期，已至使用炸彈或其他爆炸裝置，尤其是在孟買省，使用範圍相當廣大。至十一月底，會議派的組織，乃完全潛行於地下。淪議派左翼領袖，特負運動指導的重要任務，其所作爲，完全漠視印度人一般的安全與福祉而不爲一顧。印度政廳的手邊，尚留有許多情報，惟鑒於現在情勢，證據的大半，則不能公布耳。</p>
<p>白皮書的重點</p>
<p>英國政府以其所發表的白皮書而告白於世界者，計有如，左各點：</p>
<p>（一）確實認　印度最有力的政治團體之國民會議派，在甘地指導之下一本犧牲到底，不惜身命的重大決意，確立其斷乎把英國人之統治逐出印度的方針，而與印度政廳之間，絕對沒有妥協餘地。</p>
<p>（二）甘地雖從來以「非暴力之使徒一聞名於世，然對於貪得無厭的印度政廳之壓制政策，終於定下最後的決意，有不得已而採取多少暴動之悲壯的覺悟。</p>
<p>（三）甘地及會議派諸人，不但不受英美的「惡虐日本」之宣傳所惑，而竟表示其有與日本舉行交涉之準備。</p>
<p>（四）英國政府屢次要求印度全面的協助世界戰爭的遂行，然而印度民衆，尤其是會議派，却立足於「英國的危機即印度獨立的絕好機會」、之認識，更看透反軸心軍畢竟沒有防衛印度的實力。</p>
<p>（五）會議派此次運動的規模極大，且爲有組織的，對於以印度爲寳庫之英國的戰爭努力，予以重大陣碍。（丁譯自三月二十九日東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>日本輿論</h3>
<p>無用的白皮書</p>
<p>印度政廳於三月二十四日，以辯護其加於印度國民之慘酷的彈壓爲目的，發表白皮書，繼之，印度政廳的內務長官馬克斯威爾，於二十六日對國民會議派官稱，將無假借而續施其彈壓政策。</p>
<p>印度的大衆，現正爲其指導階級所率領，趁此千戰難逢之世界歷史轉變的機會，努力於解脫英國的羈絆，而創造其新的運命。這正是一八五七年以來第二次的獨立戰爭。英人深知這事，所以他們知道用空虛的約諾去誑騙印度人，早已不可能了。因此，英國人無論對於印度人所要求的獨立、所要求的新憲法，一切都以「必須等到戰後再講一的一語做前提，不肯退讓一步，而專致力於彈壓政策。換句話說，他們已是無法使印度人心滿意足，乃欲以暴力來挫其鬥志。誠如馬克斯威爾所說，把二萬八千名以上的國民會議派黨員，加以檢舉監禁，獨立運動的氣燄，尚且不衰，然則，將如何對付之呢？國民會議派雖爲一誇稱擁有黨員數百萬之大政黨，然其二萬八千名被檢舉監禁，差不多可說已把其指導層一網打盡，然而在監禁着的甘地之根據地阿美達巴德，必須新頒。布戒嚴令，這又是什麼意思呢？印度的獨立運動，已不如英國人往昔所嘲笑，謂其僅爲少數國權主義者之策動，今則獨立的精神，旣已深入於國民的下層了。</p>
<p>英國人也許以爲其二十四日所發表的白皮書，可把其兇暴的行爲轉爲正當化，然而爲今日英國人之淺薄的詭辯所騙倒者，實唯有英國人的自身而已。因爲無論是印度人，無論是現在的世界，都不是盲人聾子。所謂印度的自治，從維多利亞女王以來，到底已經有過了幾次的的諾呢？像所謂第一次自治制度，是在一九二一年實施的，當時英王喬治五世會這樣說：『這是我的帝國內自洽獨立的開始』，然而這裏够諷刺的事，就是那次印度的自治制度，原來是有始無終的。這正像把借款逐次償還半數而永無還淸之期一樣。第二次的自治法案向英國議會提出時，現任首相邱吉爾，其身雖在野，而對於該法案的破毀，曾出全力爲之，當時他曾這樣說：「使印度的政客等懷有對於獨立及完全自治之希望，是有害而無益的。這種事情，要到幾時方才可能，實無從想像。」他的理由很　明，那就是：「印度的喪失，於英帝闖實爲致命之傷，我的競爭國羣，個個都在耽耽地等待機會哩。』這是邱吉爾的本意，也就是英帝國主義者的本意。現在印度政巍，怱怱發表了一片法律理論，然而其所辯護的到底是什麼？其可承認的到底是什麼？</p>
<p>爲了印度人，箭已離弦而出了。英國人正像在其他一切的對外關係一樣，在印度也放棄了擬裝而暴露出自私殘虐的本相。他們已經回復到克來烏·赫斯欽格斯時代的英人了。這譬如受傷的野獸，對付它的方法，不在於說理，而只有把它射死的一法而已。（丁：譯自三月二十九日東京每日新聞社評）</p>
<p>英國白皮書的矛盾</p>
<p>英國政府於三月廿四日發表白皮書，就印度獨立運動之對策，闡明本國的立塲。據其所言，獨立運動的動機，在於把印度由英國的統治而完全解放，並希望避免以印度爲戰塲，爲要達成這目的，乃展開着有組織的反英運動。</p>
<p>該白皮書對於該二種動機，加以責難，尤注意於其反英運動　有組織的行動，而得出一個本格的叛亂之結論，因此而認爲有須加以徹底的彈壓之必要。</p>
<p>吾人一讀此白皮書的立論，不禁興起非常奇異之感。那就是把吾人所認爲最安當，最正當者，英國人竟極力加以責難的緣故。</p>
<p>白皮書中所舉作爲印度獨立運動的動機之二個願望，到底在什麼地方是不對的呢？其所謂似乎爲有組織的暴動行爲，不外由於英國自身對於印度沒有理解和壓迫而生的。</p>
<p>英國爲要遂行其難操勝算的戰爭，在全世界上，多行其無理的勾當。在印度國內，奪去食品的大部分，並且强制的抽　壯丁，使服軍役，種種重壓，難以　述。故　見若有組織似的印度反英抗　，實其全體民衆所受如斯水深火熱的生死苦惱爲其起因的。</p>
<p>英國若不爲這種壓迫虐待之事，則印度也不至於困苦飢餓，可以泰然而超越戰火的。狡猾而老於術策的英國，現在正不免有猢猻墜樹之感。日本人對於印度的立塲，當然是容易諒解容易同情的，欲逞非望的英國，到底不能得到印度人的容忍。那正是英國沒落的重大原因之一。簡直說，印度的反英運動，實是基於他們自己所播之種子的。尚是傲岸的英國，其所抱對於印度人之優越感和侮蔑感，甚至連大西洋憲童所規定的獨立之空名，也斷乎不適用於印度的吧。（丁：譯自三月廿八日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<p>白皮書之歷史的意義</p>
<p>近來英美的謀略戰，揭　了所謂大西洋憲章那樣渺茫的文件，呶呶於戰後世界的經營，恰如反軸心的勝利乃爲必至之勢者。可惜這辛勤策劃的謀略，在事實面前，露出破綻來了。關於波蘭及其他諸小國的戰後處置的紛爭，爲其一例。二十四日，因發表白皮書而暴露英印的關係，爲其又一例。</p>
<p>尤其是後者，最明顯地露出了英美民主主義的馬脚，而値得我們注意。這白皮書的意義，我們以爲在以大東亞戰爭爲機緣的英印關保上，將產生劃時期的變化，同時，英國本身用正式文件承認英國沒有處理印度問題的能力。在印度獨立運動史上，促進印度民族覺醒的事實有三。第一，日俄戰爭；第二，第一次歐洲大戰；第三，此次的大東亞戰爭。此次的大東亞戰爭，動搖了三世紀來以東亞爲殖民地的英國的根柢，與印度民族以特別深切的感銘。大東亞戰爭勃發以來，完成了不世之績的日本，並不恃功傲武，首先對中國一步步實行其諾霄，反映出英美的口　而實不至，並暴露出英美對印度民族反宣傳的本體，使英美喪失援蔣之理論的根據。其次，日本對南方諸民族的施策，使英荷的東亞政策與日本的東亞政策成一顯著的對照，而揭開了印度民族的眼目。第三，且最重要的，是日本履行約東允許緬甸獨立。與印度民族同困於悠久的英帝國桎梏之下的緬甸民族，今將獲得光榮的獨立，而印度民族則仍呻吟於英帝國的重壓之下。這些鐵一般的現實，昂揚了他們的獨立意　，使他們對日本的觀念爲之一變。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭中日本的戰績及對東亞民族的政策，從外面促進了印度民族的覺醒，而聖雄甘地的絕食，則從內部促進了他們的民族的自覺，在他們與壓迫者英國之間，劃出了一條決定的鴻溝。英國對這老聖雄必死的抗議，漠然處之，這是英國致命的笨策。因這英國冷酷的態度，使印度國民，甘地，在英印間的妥協上，無商議的餘地，協力英國　行戰爭，結果，更加重對印度民衆的壓迫，因而確信非暴力主義決不是完成印度國民的解放的途徑。眞正的友人，乃係從東方乘白馬而來的人，這是印度民挨傳統的信念，茲將因此而愈堅固。此次的白皮書，我們認爲不能適應上述的事實，在這事實之前，英國坦然自認完全無能爲力。正是具有歷史的意義的東西。（翔　自三月二十九日東京　賣報知）</p>

<p>當局爲維持滬市糧食實施計口授糧後、第三十一期戶口糧已於四月二日起、由兩租界六百六十五家立約米店依照規定辦法發售、至明日爲止、逾期不領作廢、關於三十二期戶口糧、已由各立約米店於昨日領取賣單、即已起繳款、向指定棧房提貨、準十一日起憑證發售至十九日爲止、</p>
<p>二批食油月內續售</p>
<p>此次食油、自經食油同業批發處實施憑房捐票計口授給以來、情形尚善、該　爲謀敷足民眾需用起見、刻已積極疏通後批來貨頃聞第二批五百噸、業於前日抵埠、大致預定待第一批售賣期於本月十二日截止後、即可繼續發售、</p>
<p>下期戶口糖十一起發售</p>
<p>全市自於上月初實行計口授糖以來、本埠食糖恐慌、業已消失、據大通社記者探悉、第二期戶口糖業已由零售商繳款出貨、決於十一日起、聞始憑二期買糖證出售、其數量仍爲第人半斤、售價連捐二元四角、</p>
<p>配給之食品全市將一致</p>
<p>頃據大通社記者向本埠各有關方面探悉、據云、嗣後全市居民、關於米·麺·糖·油·以及雜糧之計口授給量、均將逐漸趨於一律、截至目前、糖油二項、各區居民所能領到之量、已無不同、惟食米及麺粉二項、租界方面及市區仍有差異、</p>
<p>市區二期普遍售糖</p>
<p>市區第二期計口授糖、業經市糧食局飭令糖商合作營業處、先時準備、定本月十一日起至月底止、各區普遍發售、除南市滬西兩區、仍委由糖商合作營業處辦理外、其他各區則由糧局直接督導辦理、並聞浦東及市中心區等處、業成立食糖公賣處、用資防杜流弊、至授糖數量、仍規定每人爲半市斤、售價則每市斤仍以中儲券四元七角計算、</p>
<h3>廣田情報部長　昨發表談話</h3>
<p>日大使館上海事務所、昨循例招待本市中國新聞記者團、由廣田情報部長、福間副領事主席、海軍報道部長鐮舊大佐、監田中尉亦列席、</p>
<p>印渝航運力量微薄</p>
<p>席間由廣田情報部長發表談話謂：「英外相艾登於本月五日訪美完畢後、反歸英倫、此項任務乃吿一段落、但艾登該美調和協約關係之結果、一無所獲、我人可覘英美態度如何之外交暨渝對英美之影響、此外並可見蘇聯對渝之程度如何、在渝方本身之期望、爲確保英美蘇軍火及外交上之援助、但在運輸路綫困難重重之下、殊難有大規模之援助、渝方賴滇緬路之接濟、自去歲經日軍將緬甸路綫封鎖截斷後、即倚靠由印越喜馬拉雅山至渝之航空綫、力量微薄、故有向美積極要求接濟援助、供給驅逐機五百架、以及七萬五千噸汽油與其他材料、曾經美租軍委員會主席特別聲明、</p>
<p>船舶輸運又慮潛艇</p>
<p>我人在切實估計之下、渝方在輸運汽油方面、循印渝航空綫　接濟、非千架運輸機莫辦、以一機裝運十噸計算、在印渝途經消耗二噸半、實數僅剩七噸半、以每月一次、往返須經十次、以是英美之助渝、異常困難、英財院對此亦昭然透示、然英美在本國領土、北非南太平洋等作戰、以及其他各地等需機頗殷、殊難以千機援渝、若在海道以船舶運輸、又慮德國潛水艇之威脅、何况英美對南方作戰、處心積慮、更無力恢復緬甸路綫、故對渝之冀求、無法履行、而渝方尚希圖援助、雖有宋美齡之訪美、保應欽之訪英、以外交手腕强調、却亦難如願以償也、</p>
<p>羅邱會議所決方針</p>
<p>在加蕯勃朗加之羅邱會議決定、英美以歐洲爲先決問題、在此情形之下、渝方求英美之援助、當爲夢想、幫瓬英美協約政策在最後階段、毫無意義、更可異者、其對外工作、雖與英美締爲同盟、推行本身之外交政策、亦難求英美之特別協助、故雖積極如圖外交工作、亦未獲取良好結果、</p>
<p>三國隔膜並未剷除</p>
<p>最近英外相艾登訪美、我人估其目的、乃爲調整英美蘇三國之隔膜、擬定根本作戰方策、按英對蘇之態度、爲英承認蘇對歐波芬羅等小國所抱野心、犧牲弱小國家領土、並允許赤蘇勢力伸展全歐、此點經英邱吉爾首相發表談話及倫敦泰晤士報著論、均已明白顯露、允許蘇在歐洲小國、擴展共產主義、而美對蘇之態度、則分援蘇與反蘇兩派、援蘇派承認蘇侵略領土之野心行動、反蘇派由美資本家天主敎徒穩健派等融合、反對蘇聯共產主義及一般政策、以是美政府經二派之互傾、迄未表露對蘇之明朗態度、故英外長艾登赴美之結果、一無所成、</p>
<p>東亞立塲恢復共榮</p>
<p>英所發表之大西洋憲章中、有規定與弱小國家以獨立自由之協定、予以保障、惟邱之聲明、犧牲小國協約作戰、對此憲章極端矛盾即蘇聯雖因邱吉爾之表示能加援助、又因美方猶豫、故蘇聯亦難獲取英美實行一致援助、然我人之主張、渝方不應站於東亞立塲之外、要恢復東亞共榮、須與世界罪魁英美之關係斷絕根源、作自新之反省、</p>

<h3>先樂山公醫藥濟人之報</h3>
<p>— 聶雲台</p>
<p>雲臺爾士幼承母敎（曾文正公之幼女）、常以曾公不忮不求詩以補不足、世代行慈、不慕榮利、家非鉅富、而樂善好施、施學施衣施粥施茶施藥至今不倦、去冬忽遭母喪、傷感逾恒、咯血病床、尚不忘戰時人民之苦難、述樂山公醫藥濟人之報、作爲保富法下篇、爰爲刋布、以供同好、</p>
<p>先七世祖樂山公諱繼模、本江西籍、祖父起龍公始遷居衡山、公生於康熙十一年、績學能文而未應試、從祖父學醫、設小藥店、醫名大者、然公好善樂施、藥店被竊、以至閉歇、質去住屋、暫居鄰間、當地官紳因公以醫濟人、助資贖回原居、另賃屋開小藥店、康熙四十二年、衡山大疫、乞藥者晝夜不絕、全活甚眾、對於貧民禁犯救濟尤多、縣官葛公以公盛德博學、聘入縣幕、謂公曰、翁存心救人、吾無以報公、當敎汝子讀書成名、即所以云報也、即送公子先　入雯峯集賢兩書院肄業、先　旋中舉成進士、</p>
<p>公六十六歲率子入京會試、過灄口、嚴冬有疫、公施藥治之皆立愈、七十四歲率子入京銓選、由運河北上、糧船多染疫、公給以藥立愈、諸幫號呼於船側、繫公舟使不得行、公不忍捨去、命子先瀝　騾轎從陸路先行、公遲數月候疫止始抵都、（按放下自己要事以救他人、最爲難能、）時先　已選得陜西鎭安知縣、公偕赴任、鎭安山路崎嶇、辛苦萬狀、公策馬旅　、健若神仙、在署指示山民採藥、以資生產、次年返衡、寄書訓子、危以治民敎士之法、陳文恭公時爲陜西巡撫、見其書大爲稱賞、刋發通省官應以資策勉、此書後刻入皇淸經世文編、爲世何誦、公在衡常入縣獄爲禁犯治病、及妥子貴顯、公年亦八十餘歲、仍照常入獄視病、縣已使人辭謝、公曰、我自樂爲之、八十四歲、子先　丁繼母憂歸、以公高年、遂不復出、</p>
<p>一日深夜雪中有來敲門乞赴診者、子先　起應門、吿來人曰、老人年高、深液不能驚醒、候天明來可也、公憶聞聲披衣起矣、即呼子入內曰、此是生產危急、何可遲誤、遂着屐偕行、其捨已濟人之心、如此眞切、殆醫界所罕有也、</p>
<p>天之報施於公者亦至厚、公壽至九十三歲、孫肇奎乾隆壬子鄕試亞魁、曾孫七人、鎬敏銑皆翰林、歷任主考學政、　敏鈺敏皆舉人、歷任知縣、鏡敏拔貢、增生、任京秩、钑每優增生、舉孝廉力正、當時稱爲衡山七子、先高祖妣康太夫人、七十壽辰、阮文達公有賀聯云、「南獄鍾靈南陔衍慶、七旬介濤七子成名」、亦人間少佳話矣、</p>
<p>元孫即先祖父、諱爾康、號亦峯、咸豐癸丑翰林、歷任廣東石城新會知縣、高州府知府、奏獎道員、居官司廉潔、盡心民事、造福地方、積德甚厚、人民立生祠祀之、當另爲文叙述、竊嘗思之、孟子言、君子之澤五世而斬、先樂山公子係曾玄四代、科第至亦峯公爲第五世、復能勤修令德、至先君中丞公而更貴顯、不肖兄弟爲第七世、至今食其遺澤、樂山公之澤可謂久矣、</p>
<p>醫衡能活人已難、醫術精而難、吾所見各地名醫、積資至數十萬或百萬者不少其人、能傳至三世者甚少、偶有之、必爲醫　精而又好善者也、如此之人、何時不有、吾不禁馨香視之、幸願遇之、</p>
<p>然世人目光短淺者多、好善輕利者少、醫家志在發財、高抬身價、藥效如何所不研究、貧病困苦更不在念、藥店則不僅圖利、且於貴藥偷减作弊、此種情形切宜有則戒之無則加勉、近來藥價高貴異常、病者無力服藥、此爲最好行方便之時、然而有智慧之眼光能爲子孫後世着想者有幾人乎、故敬述先樂山公事、以爲業醫藥者勸、</p>
<p>先樂山公醫術活人甚多、藥店被竊、至於質屋還賬、其無發可知、八十餘歲、子作縣官司歸來雪衣署屐赴診、其到老淸貧可知、大學曰、仁者以財發身、不仁者以身發財、醫生藥店皆可發財、然對於貧家贈診贈藥、則不能發財矣、然而公雖不能發財、而竟能發身、德譽盛於當時、名聲傳於後世、公之行誼、載於陜西鎭安縣志、湖南衡州府志、衡山縣志、子孫五六代科第貴盛、此所謂以財發身者也、</p>
<h3>經濟界</h3>
<p>本市中晶橡膠商聯合會，上週開會結果，除對於原料之分配有所決定外，聞對於各橡膠廠之生產程序曾有如下之決定：（一）嚴着軍爲軍備事業，（二）其次爲工業用品，（三）再其次爲民間需用品。</p>
<p>油燴熟食，餅饅，餅麺，油條四同業公會新組聯合公會，決定自六日起開始會員登記。</p>
<h3>評言　調整同業公會的實現</h3>
<p>關於如何强化同業公會一個問題，本欄曾作多方的討論，誠以工商同業公會爲民間經濟的基層機構，其在戰時經濟上所負的責任，異常繁重，而整個的統制機構，如全國商業統制總會，尤非總台各同業公會的力量，强化各同業公會的組織，不能得到理想的成績。商業統制總會與工商同業公會，在統制工作上的聯繫，必須做到「身之使臂臂之使指」的地步，方能圓滑地推進戰時經濟統制工作。</p>
<p>實業部所公布的工商同業公會暫行條例，旣已明示同業公會的責任，而日昨實業部所組設的工商同業公會如何分類，以及主要商品同業公會及聯合會組織程序等問題，足見調整强化同業公會的一個問題，已經開始步入實現的階段，尤足徵當局的勇於採納輿論。</p>
<p>我們在三月十十九日的評言中說過：「今後同一行業，急應規定一種劃一性的同業公會，釐正名稱，並責成本業中公正淸廉負有信譽的領袖若干人，出而負責組織」。現在旣有工商同業公會整理委員會的組設，自覺指導有人；希望整理委員會諸公，於指導督率之中，多多注意於各業公會中「公正淸廉」的中堅份子，作爲相互商研的對象。</p>
<h3>商統會組織就緒　積極進行統制工作</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　全國商業統制總會，自成立後，對於物資統制工作，即積極進行，所有實施要領及物資收買配給系統，業經物資統制審議委員會第一次會議通過，正由物資統制審議委員會繼續　幹事會研究審議中。茲將該會最近情形，分詩以如下：</p>
<p>棉紗棉布登記完畢</p>
<p>該會爲實施物資統制，首先辦理中日商人棉紗布存貨登記，業於本月二日截止，華商方面，紗廠聯合會，紗業公會，布業公會，染職業公會，業已將同業會員塡就之紗布存貨登記表格，送商商統會，日商方面，已由日本上海商工會議所，將登記表格，送交商統會。現正辦理統計手續，所有各紗布商已登記之存貨，遵照當局命令，暫行停止移動。</p>
<p>物資移動申請日繁</p>
<p>該會物資移動許可事務所，自三月十六日起，開始辦理物資移動申請許可事宜後，本市中日商人，依照當局頒布條例，向該事務所申請移動者頗爲眾多，經該會審查簽發許可證，准予移動之物資事件，迄今已達千餘件之多。日來申請移動者，較前更見繁多。</p>
<p>內部組織大致就緒</p>
<p>關於該會內部組織系統，業經上次物資統制審議會議通過，決定　理事會理事長之下，有秘書長，秘書，專員，參事，評議等外，計事務部門下，設總務，審核，物資，財務四處。總務處內分文書組，會務組，簽證組，庶務組。審核處內分移動審核組，物資審核組。物資處內分交換組，登記組，購儲組，運銷組。財務處內分調度組，會計組，收支組等。共四處十五組辦公，其他專業部門，則由各工商同業工會，或聯合會改組後之每一單位，設專門研究委員會。</p>
<h3>華中振興公司召開　董監事懇談會</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　高島氏新任華中振興公司總裁後，首次振興公司及關係公司董監事懇談會，六日爲第一日。上午十時，在華中振興公司會議室舉行振興公司方面計出席高島總裁，園田理事，伴野理事，油谷理事，暨各關係理監事等，懇談會，開始，首由華中鐵　田副總裁上　理事何志杭理事等報吿該公司業務內容，並說明浙贛地區鐵道建設狀况及本年度隨時發地下資源進展，增强運輸力之計劃，至十二時半報吿比，繼於下午二時起，中華中運輸公司加賀山副董事長，井上董事，金　鳳常務董事，就去年七月創立該公司之內容爲主要業務，擴充物資收買綢增加物資運輸量等等作筆說明。最後華中蠶絲公司於三時申鈴木常務董事，王紹鈞常務董事，池上照董事等對業務內容，及今後經營方針，申述起見，末由高島總裁傳達今後適應新情勢之新方針，至下午四時半散會。又悉高島總裁於七日中午假都城飯店舉行午餐會，招待十四家關係公司董監事，進行種種懇談云。</p>
<h3>正金銀行收回軍票　日逾一千萬元</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　軍票停止新發生後其收回手續，現正順利進行，自四月一日至七日之一週間，流入橫濱正金銀行之軍票數量，日逾一千萬圓。聞橫濱正金銀行收復之此項軍票，大部份來自日方各銀行，軍票新發行旣停止，其經濟範圍自將大見狹小，故料日方各銀行將以提高利息等具體辦法，吸引華方資金，又此前集中於橫濱正金銀行之滙票買賣，今後料將由日方三菱，住友·朝鮮·臺灣·等銀行辦理。</p>
<h3>公會整委會通過　各業聯會組織程序　主要商品聯會分十類</h3>
<p>中同社滬訊　實業部爲實施戰時經濟機構，督促工商同業公會健全組織起見，特根據現行公佈之工商同業公會暫行條例之規定，組織工商同業公會整理委員會，於前（五）日起，在滬實業部駐滬辦事處內，開第一次會議，因論主要商品同業公會如何　分類，及主要商品同業公會聯合組織程序等重要問題，昨（七）日下午一時，繼續舉行會議，各委員皆出席，由主任委員袁愈佺主席，討論結果，當經通過（一）主要商品同業公會分類表，（二）商品同業公會聯合會組織程序，備文呈請實業部轉呈國民政府核准備案。</p>
<p>聯合會分十類組織</p>
<p>茲據記者探悉，主要商品同業公會聯合會，由性質中同之若干同業公會組織之，其主要商品同業公會聯合會，共分十類，計（一）絲綢業同業公會聯合會，（二）　紗布業同業公會聯合會，（三）毛紡織業同業公會聯合會，（四）煤業同業公會聯合會，（五）化學工業同業公會聯合會，（六）捲菸業同業公會聯合會，（七）火柴業同業公會聯合會，（八）皮革業同業公會聯合會，（九）橡膠業同業公會聯合會，（十）金豐業同業公會聯合會。</p>
<p>聯會組織程序要點</p>
<p>並悉主要商品同業公會聯合會組織程序之要點。（一）各業同業公會聯合會發起人，將由省市經濟局指定後，呈報實業部備案。（二）主要商品同業公會聯合會組織之單位及地域之限制，由實業部審定之，（三）聯合會發起組織及聯合會發起人，由實業部核准或指定之。</p>
<h3>大阪棉紗　人造纖維統制會　議設華北棉花營團</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　據大阪電話稱，此間棉紗人造纖維統制會，六日曾假棉業會館召開原料部會及評議員會，協義關於華北棉花增產之種種對策，結果：決定設立一棉花營團，以爲該會之中心機關，該營團將統合在華北所有之棉花關係機關，由中日官出資設立，預定出資一億元，辦理一棉花栽培之指導，（二）栽培及收買，（三）價格之決定及調整，（四）開發鹼地等。統制會刻正努力使該營團　日實現云。</p>
<h3>對於全國商業統制總會之觀感（二）</h3>
<p>— 兼言</p>
<p>（二）務　達到增產之目的：商業統制會，目的，在於以統制之方式，增加生產，解決民生。限制物資之移動，係因物資之存量不多者，不得不以消極的方式，設立保存，以免有關工業之中輟。故商業統制總會，最終目的，仍爲有關各工業之普通增產。爲達到增產之目的，被限制物品之種類，實以愈少爲愈妙。現經頒佈限制移動之物品，計爲汽車及零件，汽油及石油，機械，通訊材料，金屬，藥品，橡皮，紗布，蠟燭，火柴，肥皂，糖，棉花，米等十四類。除此十四類以外，除非絕對的必需，實不宜再增，以免阻碍貨物流通，並接削减生產。以言積極增加生產，商統會首應注意，如此促進華中華北華南物資之交流，以期疏通原料來源，直接增加工業生產。蓋目前物價所以如此昂貴，其因固多，然物資缺乏，實爲其主因之一。物資缺乏，由於生產减少，而生產减少，又由於原料不足。故最近數年以來，原料品價格升漲之速，有時超出製成品之上，（如礦產原料，三十一年十二月指數增至八二五一，機器等製成品指數，偶爲五一九〇）。一般工廠，鑒於原料較製成品價格之升漲迅速，反不積極生產，而轉事囤積原料；因出售原料可獲之利益，反較出售製品遠爲優厚。由於此種畸形狀態之存在，物資缺乏，乃益嚴重，物價高昂，益無止境。故商統會如能促進華中華北華南物資之交流，則原料缺乏之困難，或可相當减輕。據吾人所知，華北物資可以南運者，計有煤，油，油籽，生皮，烟葉，碱，棉花，羊毛，生鐵等原料；華南物資可以北運者，計有椰子乾，牛皮，生絲，木材等原料。此數項原料，果能與華中餘之紗布以及各種輕工業製造品，互相交換，則（一）可使華中一帶工業原動力之成本輕减，一般工業製品之價格减價；（二）可使一般工廠，因受原料力供給限制而减少生產者，恢復其正常產量，（三）可使過云紡紗，染織，捲烟，肥皂，毛織，榨油，絲織等工業，因原料匱乏而减工者，照常開工。故商統會　能眞正做到華中，華北華南間物資交流之實現，其嘉惠於國計民生者實無限量。</p>

<h3>環境與心理</h3>
<p>— 宗文</p>
<p>環境是客觀的，心理是主觀的，形成環境的條件是政治制度，經濟機構和社會階級。改變心理的條件是學力，經騐，意志，思想，遺傳，想像。但兩者是互爲因果的，有着密切的關係，環境的決定，有心理作用的原因，心理的轉變，受環境力量的影響。不過心理是主觀的意志力，環境是客觀的社會力，主觀的意志力，可以戰勝客觀的社會力。但是客觀的環境，決定主觀的心理。</p>
<p>環境與心理的具體表現，是在社會與思想，但是思想是社會生活的反映，所以心理的基礎仍在環境。有了心理上的悲感，就會覺着環境上愁悶。因着環境上的苦悶，就會增加心理上的愁緒。</p>
<p>誤解環境的靑年，受着了挫折和艱困，不但不去努力的奮鬥，勇敢的在人生的征途上挑戰，却拒絕了環境的敎訓，走到反常的路途，表顯消極的心理。</p>
<p>你看，那般不願意接受環境鍛鍊他的靑年，意志是消極頽唐了，心理是失望悵惘了，不滿於現實的環境，痛恨於社會的黑暗，就沉醉在聲色犬馬物質的享受和肉慾的發洩，漸漸把生命犧牲在這種反常心理的歡樂下。又有些靑年在這環境下，專門去根據了他的幻想妄動，結果也被這社會排擠出了生存圈。這種反動現象和反常生理，是因爲誤認了環境。</p>
<p>另有一種靑年，對於環境，確能够把握着正確的認識，在艱苦裏不間斷的努力，有毅力，有思想，能够利用環境，鍛鍊自己的意志，豐富自己的經騐，最後能　破不幸的環境，征服惡劣的環境，達到了事業的成功。</p>
<p>能利用環境而堅定意志的這種人，常常就是我們在歷史上所謳歌的偉人們。</p>
<p>時代在演進，環境在轉變，心理在變更，社會是動的，封建的社會崩潰了，就會有新的社會建立。在道樣環境裏，我們不應該有反常的心理！</p>
<p>我們需要以科學的精神，和求眞的態度，健全我們的心理狀態，改造我們惡劣的環境，纔不爲虛榮名利所誘惑。</p>
<h3>閒話</h3>
<p>— 企洛</p>
<p>娓娓　聽的「規勸是我們所缺乏的潤滑的油；袖手旁觀的「閒話」是我們不需要的粗燥的沙。有了油，我們可以順利地進行；有了沙，我們祗會受挫折或停頓。</p>
<p>我們常常喜歡說人家的「閒話」。可是，一定沒有計及當我們在進行某一件工作的時候，他人的「閒話」也會接二連三不斷地迎頭而來。如果當事者是個自信力決斷力極强的人。還沒有大妨礙。如果是一個優柔寡斷的人，那麼，他便很可能徘徊途中，毫無成就，取得最劣的後果。</p>
<p>做一個拙劣的譬喻：「閒話」好像是一頭勢利的惡狗，你穿得愈破爛，它愈是叫囂隳突聲勢煊嚇。你愈是陷於深淵中，「閒話」愈會源源而來。所以我國有句俗諺說：「勝則爲王，敗則爲寇」。這就是「閒話」的作用呀！</p>
<p>我們不要去嗔怪他人說「閒話」，只要自己不說他人「閒話」戲够了。如果每個人能够這樣做，「閒話」自然會銷聲匿跡。</p>
<p>所以，爲己爲人的前途起見，我們得努力自制，不要說人家的「閒話」。</p>
<p>我們需要娓娓動聽的「規勸」；我們不要袖手旁　的「閒話」。</p>
<h3>「潛意識」</h3>
<p>— 企洛</p>
<p>尋常，有許多事情成於『潛意識』；但，有更多審情，却因「潛意識」而失敗。</p>
<p>往往當我們做一件事　時，有一種無形的力量支配着我們，這就是「潛意識」的作用。</p>
<p>『潛意識」又名「下意識」，是一種隱藏於內心的意識；是一種特强的情感。每一個人都有，但各人因學識，修養，情操的不同而互異。它侖驟然跑來，又會突然失踪。理智無力控制它，也不能去阻止它。它偶然可以得到勝利，但如果它的成功是與法律相牴觸的；那麼，便是犯罪。因此，造成了很多不幸的失敗者。</p>
<p>所以，我們平時要注意於學識，修養，情操的培植，造成較强的理智。不要使『潛意識』時常拋頭露面。</p>

<p>「在黃家那有自由自在的一刻—而且做死也沒有什麼成績，更沒有誰說一聲好，我眞不高興再做下去了！他們富，我也不要再看，而日他們富，我看也不會保得長久的，因爲裏面一個好人都沒有，這種人家那有不敗的道理！」</p>
<p>「眞的麼：」大根說時，手把着滿滿的茶杯，瞪目看着水面上的蒸汽，只見一陣過了，水面上淸了一下，似乎就將淸下去，然而立即水面上又結成了一層白膜，一片一片地裂開來，再化成了一陣汽，飛起來，消散在空氣中。他一連看了好幾陣，似乎看出了神。</p>
<p>「不過，」阿五的聲調放得和平些，「三小姐到底是好的。—」</p>
<p>大根將手放開了茶杯，不再呆看，只用嘴輕輕地吹着，水面上的白膜，便格外結得快，裂得快，消散得快。</p>
<p>「今年正月裏，楊老頭子來爲前塘橋周家做媒人，給她知道了，竟被她駡了出去。她說她不希罕有錢的人家！……」</p>
<p>「眞的麼？」將茶杯端起來，再吹兩下，一口氣就喝了下去，喝完，取起茶壺，給阿五斟斟滿，自己也斟滿了。</p>
<p>「誰設不眞。」</p>
<p>「那倒很可惜的。周家我也見過，眞是一個豪富的人家。這樣的人家她還不要，那她一定要嫁一個有才　有品貌的洋狀元了。」</p>
<p>「我也想只有　狀兀才可以　她。看她的情形，像大姑爺二姑爺的人都不在她的眼裏……」</p>
<p>黃家的事情，作了談話的資料。賣西瓜子的走過來，阿五取出三個銅圓，買了一堆邀大根吃。大根只好拙手笨脚地學着吃。阿五則很會吃，用不到手，整整的一粒，丟進嘴裏，馬上就　有兩爿穀吐出來。大根若有所感地說：</p>
<p>「阿五哥，我覺得你是不應該住在鄉下的，應該住在城裏的。……」</p>

<h3>記東寳歌舞</h3>
<p>— 獨樂</p>
<p>這一次到南京去，唯一的意外牧穫，便是看到了大華大戲院東寳歌舞團的大公演，這在到過日本的人，也許不覺得什麼希罕，我們却是從來衹聽得人家談起寳塚　　的偉大，而現在寳塚劇塲的東寳歌舞團居然浩浩蕩蕩的來到了中國，而我却在他們慶祝使節的任務下在南京獲到了一個「先覩」的機會眞是欣喜萬狀起初，我還以爲在東寳歌舞團旣是日本的產物，所有的歌舞一定富於日本風味，那至多表露日本的古代美，在演出方面，我並沒有多大希望，但結果使我大大的詫異：東寳少女不是我們想像中的那麼矮，都是很高的身材。非常健美的體格，七八年前我們在上海看到的萬花團，許多美國少女也許還不能和她們媲美，這纔是奇蹟。因之她們的歌舞也就並不偏重於日本風格，日本風格的歌舞衹有十個節目，完全歸納在第一部裏邊，第二部開始都變了</p>
<p>輕鬆明朗的東西，却有二十四個大節目，節奏非常明快，一秒鐘不停留，觀衆在臺下也似乎「目不暇接」，陶醉在這個曼妙的氛圍中了。歌舞之外，他們還有短劇有一個短劇，臺上站着兩個人，一人描摹猩猩動作，十分酷肯，戴了假面具，把一個女人嚇跑了；接着又有一個女人走來，他仍舊把面具戴上了，可是那女人一點不覺得駭怕似的站着不動；等到他把面具卸下，這女人瞧了他一面反而駭叫起來，返身即跑。這短劇在臺上衹有一分多鐘，臺下看客的笑聲，恐怕還不止一分鐘哩！</p>
<p>東寳歌舞，我覺得很滿意</p>

<h3>Falling Grain Prices and Rising Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>Today, we are raising the issue of commodity prices again. Perhaps some will say: "Commodity prices! Commodity prices! We hear too much about it. No matter how thorough the solutions are, they do not get any response in reality." However, we still believe that the current commodity price problem is the most important issue concerning the people's livelihood. Precisely because it does not get any response in reality, it should be discussed more thoroughly to ensure a reasonable solution. This is the responsibility of the journalistic world.</p>
<p>In the editorial on the second of this month, it was said: "We have said, and most people have said the same, that the grain problem is the center of the commodity price problem. The rise and fall of general commodity prices often changes with grain prices. However, current facts do not prove this assertion, because grain prices have fallen, but other commodity prices have not fallen accordingly." The editorial on the third of this month also said: "Judging from recent trends, grain prices have fallen, but some other commodity prices are still rising. The masses, who have become 'birds startled by the twang of a bow' due to high commodity prices in recent years, are shrouded in the shadow of 'grain prices may rise again' on their heartstrings. In fact, there is no need to worry about this. We should study how to stop the rise of some commodity prices, which is a meaningful way out." Today, we want to use these two paragraphs as the center to state some opinions:</p>
<p>First, in the past, did general commodity prices rise with grain prices? It can be said that it was absolutely true. Laborers said: We must eat enough to work, so if grain prices rise, wages must be increased. Industrial producers said: Because wages increase and raw materials increase in price, the price of manufactured goods must also be increased. Market vendors said: Because the wholesale price has increased, if we sell at a low price and replenish at a high price, we will lose money, so we must raise prices. When grain prices were high, there was no reason to suppress other commodity prices from following suit. Therefore, we fundamentally demanded at the time to suppress grain prices and stabilize other commodity prices, which can also be said to sympathize with the rise of other commodity prices besides grain. However, since the increase in registered household rice and the adjustment of transportation restrictions, grain prices began to fall in the middle of last month, and the rate of decline was quite large. Then, since we admit that all commodity prices rise with grain prices, there is no reason to say that they cannot fall with grain prices. Therefore, the current phenomenon that grain prices have fallen, but other commodity prices have not fallen but have risen, is unreasonable and must be stopped.</p>
<p>Second, we say that there is no need to worry about 'grain prices may rise again', mostly to stabilize the general psychology. If we do not immediately take measures to limit the rise of other commodity prices, thus stimulating the rebound of grain prices, it is naturally very likely. In some artificial and adverse situations, economic principles and the logic of facts are often distorted. We have suffered enough from high grain prices in the past, and we can no longer allow it to revive. Therefore, we must be careful to prevent the bad phenomenon of general commodity prices not falling with grain prices, which may produce the opposite effect of stimulating grain prices to rise again.</p>
<p>Third, the mentality of most holders of goods is that if grain prices rise, my goods can also rise. These people are not threatened by grain prices and do not value the rise of grain prices at all. The environment of high commodity prices over the years has created their nature of "troubled waters" and "schadenfreude", taking the opportunity to make money, watching each other, you rise and I rise, you don't fall and I don't fall. For the sake of stabilizing the public's life, we must find a way to break this mentality.</p>
<p>Fourth, we emphasize that the current commodity price problem lies in the psychological panic and bad psychology of some people, creating a phenomenon of a price increase race. An analogy can be made: "For example, if a theater catches fire, everyone is in a hurry, crowding in the door and daring not to go out. As long as someone shouts loudly, takes three steps back, and opens the door, everyone can come out in an orderly manner and be saved." Therefore, we also expect the merchants who are racing to raise prices to take three steps back and seek a way out for everyone!</p>
<p>We believe that the most appropriate way to reasonably adjust the current general commodity prices is to implement "comprehensive price controls." And it has reached a stage where it must be implemented urgently. As for the standard of price limits, specifically speaking: "Price limits should be based on grain prices." All commodity price rates should be based on the highest grain price in mid-March, and then decrease accordingly according to the ratio of grain prices. Except for special cases where raw materials and equipment are not easy to obtain and costs have indeed increased, which must be strictly investigated, this principle must be followed. In addition, it is naturally necessary to consider all aspects carefully, carefully consider the circumstances and reason, in order to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Finally, we are the ones who sit and talk, and we urge the relevant government departments to quickly take action. We firmly believe that this major issue concerning the people's livelihood will surely be supported and cooperated by the broad masses of the people.</p>

<h3>Huang Ziqiang Talks About His Opinions on Army Training</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: The newly appointed Lieutenant General Huang Ziqiang, Director-General of Army Training of the Military Commission, at the request of a Central News Agency reporter yesterday, gave an important talk, elaborating on his opinions on army training, roughly saying: "The work of army training of the National Army can be divided into two parts: one is building the army, and the other is reorganizing the army. Regarding building the army, the National Government has long announced the General Outline for Army Preparation. In the future, we should strive to build a new army and strengthen the strength of various units according to the General Outline. As for reorganizing the army, I believe that the current National Army has not yet reached the level of a modern army. Therefore, in the future, we must take building a modern army as the goal of advancement. The main points are to eradicate all the bad habits of the old dyes, especially the feudal ones must be thoroughly broken, and eliminate the bad habits of sticking to the local area. For this reason, we must follow the outline of the New National Movement, cultivate the spirit of a new national, so that the generals and soldiers of the National Army have firm beliefs, so as to improve the quality of the National Army. The quality of the army is closely related to the establishment of the organizational system, equipment, education and training, the development of the resources industry of the entire country, the level of national education, and national morality. Therefore, under the current situation, we should focus on full-strength spiritual training, that is, political training, and combat technical training, and then we can talk about improving the organizational system and equipment. The current focus of training must be to do our best to enrich the beliefs of the national generals and soldiers, to serve the country, and to respect the leaders, to fulfill the new spirit of the New National Movement, to make up for other shortcomings, and to serve as the guide for improving the army.</p>
<h3>Chen, Special Envoy to Japan, Arrives in Tokyo, Pays His First Visit to Various Ministers, Attends Ambassador Xu's Welcome Banquet That Evening</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: Chen Gongbo, the special envoy of the National Government to Japan, and his entourage arrived here at 3:25 pm today and entered the Imperial Hotel to rest. At 4:10 pm, he went to the Army Ministry to visit Army Minister Tojo and Chief of Staff Sugiyama. At 4:35 pm, he went to the Foreign Minister's official residence to visit Foreign Minister Tani. At 4:50 pm, he visited Aoki, Minister of Greater East Asia. At 5:00 pm, he went to the Prime Minister's official residence to visit Prime Minister Tojo to exchange greetings after arriving in Japan. At 5:30 pm, he visited Navy Minister Shimada and Chief of Naval Operations Nagano. At 6:30 pm, he attended the welcome banquet hosted by Xu, the Chinese ambassador to Japan.</p>
<p>In addition, my country's special envoy to Japan, Mr. Chen Gongbo, and his four entourage members, departed from Nanjing on the 6th and arrived here at 3:25 pm on the 7th. Xu Liang, my former ambassador to Japan, Japanese Foreign Minister Tani, Aoki, Minister of Greater East Asia, Hori, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tominaga, Vice Minister of the Army, Sawamoto, Vice Minister of the Navy, and people from all walks of life came to the station to welcome him. After arriving in Tokyo, Special Envoy Chen plans to visit Prime Minister Tojo and representatives from all walks of life in Japan to express his gratitude for the friendly assistance of the National Government and to express the determination of the National Government to complete the Greater East Asia War to the Japanese government and people. He will also hold talks with various parties in Japan on various policies for cooperation between China and Japan. Relations between China and Japan will therefore become closer. The mission and significance of Ambassador Chen's visit to Japan are extremely significant. Due to Prime Minister Tojo's visits to China and Manchukuo, the visit of Burmese Ba Maw, Administrative Head, to Japan, and Ambassador Chen's visit to Japan, the link to complete the Greater East Asia War and build the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is becoming stronger.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: After arriving here on the afternoon of the 7th, Chen Gongbo, the special envoy of the National Government to Japan, made a statement on this visit to Japan. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>This time, our country is participating in the Greater East Asia War. I was specially appointed to visit your country to listen to the teachings of your country's government and people, and to thank you for returning the special concession and abolishing extraterritoriality. I still remember that three years ago, when the National Government returned to the capital, I was ordered to visit Japan as a thank-you gift. I will never forget the sincere hospitality and warm intentions of your country's government and people. Now, from the belief of sharing joys and sorrows, we have advanced to the practice of sharing life and death. I am very honored and pleased to be ordered to visit your country again. Your country launched the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the year before last, and has been invincible. All East Asian nations have felt deeply inspired. Our country has been oppressed by British and American imperialism and bound by unequal treaties for hundreds of years. Now, we can be liberated at the same time as other East Asian nations. All nationals are willing to do their best to follow your country and seek their own liberation and the liberation of all East Asian nations. Therefore, when your country launched the Greater East Asia War, Chairman Wang immediately issued a statement of sharing joys and sorrows, and now he has implemented participation in the war and issued a vow of sharing life and death. On the day when the National Government returned to the capital, the Chairman and his colleagues in the National Government had the idea that they would not be satisfied with the peace between China and Japan and the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, but would take the great task of China and Japan jointly shouldering the security of East Asia as their highest ideal and ultimate goal. This ideal and goal is shared by those with the same aspirations for the alliance of the past and today. On the day our country participated in the war, your country issued a statement, returning the special concessions in our country and recognizing the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Beijing Embassy District, abolishing extraterritoriality, and other good measures, and doing its best to exchange for the construction of a new China. In the future, in order to adapt to the development of the new Sino-Japanese relations, various existing agreements will also be reconsidered in the same spirit. Moreover, on the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital this year, your country first implemented the return of the special concessions and cooperated in the handover of the Xiamen Public Concession and the Beijing Embassy District. This kind of enthusiasm for cooperating in the liberation of China and the decision to assist China's independence has made the people of our country hold an indescribable sense of gratitude and are more willing to cooperate with your country with manpower and material resources on the front line and in the rear. In addition to listening to the teachings of your country's government and people, this visit to your country is also a mission to express our heartfelt gratitude to your country. What I would like to express to your country's government and people is that your country resolutely participated in the war this time, completely driven by morality and conscience, and even more inspired by your country's enthusiasm and sincerity. Our country will never be satisfied with the name of participating in the war in vain, but after the desolation, we sincerely hope to contribute our manpower and material resources to the Greater East Asia War, but we only hope to advance hand in hand with your country and fight side by side, no matter what sacrifices we cannot refuse. Secondly, today's Sino-Japanese sincere cooperation is completely based on the ideals and aspirations of those with the same aspirations on both sides. Before the National Government returned to the capital, no one could believe that China and Japan could cooperate sincerely. After returning to the capital, no one could believe that China could cooperate as sincerely as it does today. However, both parties have unwavering confidence and continue to make unremitting efforts, and finally have the good results of today. This also cannot but thank the far-sightedness and lofty ideals of the authorities of the two countries and the great achievements of the people's cooperation. From now on, China and Japan will not only be sincere friends, but also brothers. As the saying goes, "Without suffering, there is no friendship; without hardships, there is no talk of life and death." Today, when I return to your country, I am overwhelmed with emotion. The colleagues of the National Government are determined to make efforts for the future of China and the overall situation in East Asia. It is hoped that your country's government and people will understand China's difficulties and hardships, and cooperate further. This is what I deeply feel.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang Orders Prohibition of Gambling</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: Military Commission Order: The chairman believes that the gambling atmosphere in the capital has been rampant recently, neglecting duties, corrupting customs, leading to the abandonment of discipline and the decline of personality, which is extremely hateful. Therefore, he specially ordered the capital garrison headquarters to strictly investigate and ban it. If anyone deliberately violates it, they will be arrested and severely punished to prevent others from following suit. After Commander Li received the order, he immediately convened the relevant agencies of the capital on the 7th of this month to discuss the measures for investigation and prohibition. It is reported that after the regulations for prohibiting gambling are formulated and announced, they will be strictly investigated and prohibited.</p>
<h3>Head of the Japanese Cultural Mission, Shioya On, Expresses His Thoughts</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: Before the Japanese cultural circles celebrated the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital and attended the Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, they specially organized a cultural mission to visit China. After completing their mission, the group is now going to various places to visit and inspect. Dr. Shioya On, the head of the group, specially wrote an article about his thoughts on this trip and sent it to the local Mainichi Shimbun. The general meaning is as follows: During the opening ceremony of the Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, I respectfully listened to Chairman Wang's speech, which was deeply admired and felt the same. China and Japan have very close relations with the same race, the same writing system, and the same way. What is the same race? That is, the Chinese and Japanese nations both have a strong East Asian bloodline. We are brothers. What is the same continent? China and Japan are both building countries in East Asia adjacent to each other, only separated by a strip of water. At present, Japan is the vanguard of East Asia, and China is the rear base. Considering the meaning of "when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold", the two countries have a close relationship that is related to survival. What is the same writing system? China and Japan use the same writing system and read Chinese characters. Even literature written in Japanese can be understood. What is the same way? China and Japan are both agricultural countries, and the family system is quite developed. In ancient Japan, there was only the way but no religion. The so-called way is the ancient Japanese "Shinto". The cultivation of "Shinto" depended on Confucianism. The first book of Confucius to be introduced to Japan was the Analects. The Analects is the teaching of Confucius, and the teaching of Confucius is the way of the spirit. This way of the spirit is the inherent spiritual culture of China. Chairman Wang once said that the Three Principles of the People and the way of governing the country and the world with the kingly way and righteousness of the inherent Chinese culture are the same, that is, the same as Confucianism. At this Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Congress, Chairman Wang vigorously advocated the spiritual cooperation between China and Japan, and I deeply agree with this. We must quickly destroy the common enemy of British and American imperialism and strive to build a new order in East Asia, that is, a moral country. Therefore, in addition to punishing the enemy with force, we should also actively revitalize the traditional spiritual culture inherent in the two countries. Here, I sincerely hope that the cultural fighters of China and Japan will unite in the future to promote Sino-Japanese friendship, defend East Asia, and work hard to establish world peace. In addition, Mr. Okushi Toushiro, a representative of this cultural mission, also wrote an article and sent it to the local Mainichi Shimbun, expressing his impressions of this trip. The general meaning is that I have three impressions of the new China after participating in the war. First, the chairman is absolutely admired and trusted by the Japanese living in China. No one among the Japanese living in China does not admire Chairman Wang's personality and vision. I think the foundation for the future development of China has been laid here. Second, I have had many talks with Chinese people who are open-minded, which is my first time. This is Mr. Cui Peitong, a young student about 30 years old, who will serve as the deputy director of the Baoding Education Research Institute. When Mr. Cui discussed Sino-Japanese relations in detail, he was eloquent and tireless all night. It was the first time that I had a conversation with such an open-minded Chinese person, and I felt sincerely happy. Third, Japan's abolition of extraterritoriality in China is extremely important in political relations. Chinese people must be grateful for Japan's kindness, so this will allow various places to develop vigorously. I am convinced of this. The Chinese and Japanese nations were both born in Asia and both suffered from British and American aggression. Therefore, they should help each other. However, the reason why the two countries have not been able to fully cooperate until today is because China still has British and American colors in its thinking and politics, but also because Japan has not completely cleared the remaining poison of the British and Americans. If China still has doubts about maintaining its territory, it will be difficult to expect it to jointly devote itself to the great cause of reviving East Asia. Now, Japan, based on the concept of moral politics, first abolished extraterritoriality in China, which can be regarded as Japan's expression of respect for the territorial rights of various countries in the great cause of building the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.</p>

<h3>Soviet Large-Scale Offensive in the Kuban Region of Northern Caucasus Fails, Germany Completes Cleaning Up of Donets River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Soviet army has launched a large-scale offensive against the mouth of the Kuban River in northern Caucasus since the 4th. However, according to a war situation announced by the German military headquarters on the 6th, the Soviet army suffered heavy losses after only one day of attack and had to abandon the attempt to attack. In addition, according to German authorities, the Soviet army's failure to attack Kuban is of great significance in view of the current situation in the southern battlefield. Most of the German troops who retreated from various parts of the Caucasus in winter have now gathered in the Kuban region. Therefore, it can prevent the Soviet army from attacking and ensure the position. In the eyes of the Soviet army, this is a great threat to the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: The official German news agency announced last night that the German army had captured the last two bridgeheads defended by the Soviet army and had occupied the entire west bank of the middle reaches of the Donets River on Monday. The large-scale clearing war has now been completed. German wireless broadcasts that the German troops north of Balaklava had attacked a certain military stronghold and reached the Donets River bank on the 5-mile front line. Balaklava is 30 miles northwest of Izyum. According to a Reuters reporter in Moscow, there are also fierce battles day and night south of Izyum. The German army is increasing its deployment of tank troops and aircraft to fight there. The German mortars are now densely firing at the Soviet artillery in the area. The German and Soviet armies are now preparing for the second phase of the battle, so there is a large movement of troops and materials along the 1,200-mile front line inside the Soviet border. A German news agency said that the Soviet army in the upper reaches of the Donets River southeast of Belgorod attacked the German forward bridgehead on the east bank of the river on Monday, but was repelled and suffered heavy losses. According to Berlin, the German offensive forces on the eastern section of the Orel front line have achieved significant success, occupying a village and capturing many outposts and fortified positions in front of the main front line. During the street fighting, part of the Soviet army was wiped out, and the rest was driven away. By dawn on April 5, the area was firmly in German hands. German troops in the Sochi and base area northwest of Orel have made further progress after several local battles. The Soviet army made a large-scale attack south of the German Kuban bridgehead in northwestern Caucasus, and was completely defeated. It no longer took large-scale actions. On the northwestern front, the Red Army continued to try to break through the German line south of Lake Ilmen in Staraya Russa, but each attack was repelled by the German defenders. The German long-range artillery south of Lake Ladoga bombarded the moving Soviet army with great effect. The German Air Force also provided important assistance to the ground troops and attacked several strongholds of the Murmansk Railway. Both Germany and the Soviet Union naturally took advantage of the current silence of the Eastern Front to devote themselves to reorganizing their troops and other preparations for the future summer battles. British and American reporters in Moscow said that the Soviet army would never want to just defend in the summer of this year, and would do its best to regain the initiative, at least to restrain a large part of the German army elsewhere. This can be regarded as the Soviet Union's request to its allies to establish a second front again. However, Captain Falls, the military reporter of the London Times, recently pointed out that the British and American offensive on the European continent would be difficult to succeed without the effective assistance of the Soviet army. Britain and the United States seem to hope that the Soviet army will win the first battle against the Axis powers in the summer of this year. Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union all seem to have realized that Germany's military power is stronger than ever before, so they are shirking each other, so as to avoid hurting their own wrists by attacking the solid German army first.</p>
<h3>Tunisia: Anglo-American Forces Launch Offensive Against Axis</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th - Central News Agency: The brief lull on the Tunisian battlefront ended yesterday. The British Eighth Army has launched an attack against the Axis forces under the command of Field Marshal Rommel and Lieutenant General Arnim. The Berlin side was not surprised by this British attack, as they had anticipated it for several days. Over the past few days, Anglo-American forces have carefully redeployed their troops and undertaken other preparations. According to anti-Axis sources in North Africa today, the British army began attacking Axis positions at Shang Akarit at 4:30 AM yesterday. Their primary objective appears to be to join forces with the American troops stationed 40 miles away at El Guettar. Anti-Axis sources emphasize the strength of the Axis defense and believe that this offensive will be quite difficult. Reuters reports that the Axis-held positions are actually superior to what the advancing troops had originally imagined, so General Montgomery had to wait several days.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th - Central News Agency: According to reports from the Tunisian front, the two armies on the Tunisian front had reached a stalemate by the 5th. The Axis positions are becoming increasingly fortified, leaving no openings for the anti-Axis forces. In the northern sector, Anderson's army is divided into three groups. One group crossed the Sedjnane mountains and advanced along the coast towards Bizerte. The other two main groups are confronting Arnim's forces in the Mazel area. On the 5th, they attacked the left flank of the Axis forces at Jebel Bab, but were repelled after fierce fighting by the Axis forces. In the central sector, the Axis forces launched a sudden offensive and captured several heights in Pichon, which is extremely advantageous to the Axis defensive posture. American forces east of Maknassy have been continuously attacking for nearly twelve days, attempting to break through the Axis positions, but have failed. According to a report from Axis reconnaissance planes on the 5th, the American forces in that area are currently moving north. Furthermore, on the 5th, Axis air forces attacked the enemy airfield at Télerpte, behind the first line in the central sector, destroying twenty enemy aircraft. They also shot down ten enemy aircraft in aerial combat.</p>
<h3>Tagore Cancels Trip to North Africa</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th - Central News Agency: The Allied governments are deeply surprised by Tagore's sudden cancellation of his planned meeting with Giraud in North Africa at the last minute. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull also denied any knowledge that Tagore was forced to take this step by General Eisenhower. When the President and Secretary of State addressed the press in Washington today, they both said that they had not received any information that would confirm that General Eisenhower had sent a telegram to London to delay Tagore's meeting. Neutral parties have openly expressed suspicion about the background of the political situation in North Africa, and that there is even more manipulation. London sources said that this matter is also related to the return of British Foreign Secretary Eden to Britain. American newspaper reports stated that Eden had recently promised the American side during his visit to the United States that Giraud was the leader of the French rebellious movement, so the American military commander sent a telegram to London. However, it is still unclear tonight whether Tagore's actions were actually instigated by General Eisenhower, or whether they were initiated by Tagore or Giraud. However, this action will undoubtedly deal a major blow to Tagore's committee in London. Reuters and American newspapers in London both emphasize this fact. According to reports from Stockholm, the London correspondent of the Swedish newspapers said that no possible future meeting date has been specified, which will make the disappointment of Tagore's faction even greater.</p>
<h3>British House of Lords Discusses the Indian Question</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th - Central News Agency: According to reports from London, during the concluding debate in the British House of Lords today on the government's motion to extend the state of emergency in six Indian provinces for another year, someone suggested inviting experts from other countries to resolve the Indian deadlock. Lord Hailey said, "Further negotiations with the All-India Congress Party and Gandhi will also be fruitless, and it is dangerous to let the situation stagnate. We have promised to grant India autonomy and cannot go back on our word. We can only move forward and show India and the world our sincerity." He advocated for the Indianization of the Indian Governor-General's Executive Council and invited experts from other countries to form a fact-finding committee to consider a constitutional system with a representative government for India. Before adjourning, the House of Lords passed all six government motions. During the debate, Lord Munster revealed that the taxes borne by Indians last year had increased more than fivefold compared to before the war. In the past fiscal year, Indian taxpayers contributed £180,000,000 to national defense expenditures, compared to £34,000,000 before the war. The runways built by the British in India total no less than 1,100 miles, and the cost is borne by India. Lord Munster also said, "We still adhere to the principle that India should bear the cost of its own defense. All British and Indian troops stationed in India are paid by India, and the airfields and other military projects built in India are also paid for by India. Factories producing military supplies also bear a portion of the costs in proportion to their benefits."</p>
<h3>Axis Submarines Active, Allied Ship Losses Increase</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th - Central News Agency: According to reports from Washington, US Secretary of the Navy Knox declared this month that the number of ships lost by the Allies in the Atlantic last month was much higher than in February, and that German submarines have intensified their operations and are using new tactics. Answering questions at a routine press briefing today, the US Secretary of the Navy said, "There is much evidence of increased submarine activity in the Atlantic. Many ships have been sunk, and many German submarines have also been lost. This is a serious and difficult situation, and there is no room for optimism." The US Secretary of the Navy expressed doubts about the effectiveness of Allied bombing of Axis submarine bases in Europe, saying, "It is difficult to say. We should assume that it has caused them considerable hindrance." Reuters' naval correspondent said that the US Secretary of the Navy's remarks did not shock naval circles in London. Hitler has declared that he will launch a spring offensive, and the reduction of Atlantic storms is also conducive to submarine warfare. The correspondent said, "The number of submarines in the Atlantic area has recently increased significantly. It is expected that Churchill will soon issue a statement on this issue. Since Colonel Knox has expressed doubts about the results of bombing submarine bases on the continent and expressed concern about the increase in ship sinkings, it is expected that Churchill will also inform the public about this matter as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>South American Bolivia Declares War on Axis Powers</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 7th - Central News Agency: According to reports from La Paz, the Bolivian cabinet has passed President Castillo's proposal to declare war on the Axis powers.

<h3>Large Squadrons of Japanese Planes Bomb Indian-Burmese Border</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 7th - Central News Agency: A dispatch from New Delhi states that the Indian anti-Axis military headquarters announced on the 6th that large formations of Japanese air force fighters and bombers came to southern Bengal state on the 5th, and another squadron heavily bombed the Indian-Burmese border.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 7th - Central News Agency: A dispatch from New Delhi states that the headquarters of the British Indian Expeditionary Force announced that Japanese air force units bombed British positions in Chittagong again on the 5th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th - Central News Agency: According to reports from New Delhi, the British Expeditionary Force Headquarters in India recently acknowledged that the Japanese had resumed attacks on military targets in northeastern India. According to a declaration yesterday, Japanese planes heavily bombed Chittagong in Assam province on the 5th. The British headquarters disclosed that all targets in Feni, Bengal, were bombed by Japanese planes. One Hurricane fighter was lost on the 2nd. On the same day, Japanese planes also bombed British positions on the Indian-Burmese border, causing considerable damage.</p>
<h3>New Medicine for Diphtheria: Goat Serum Invented by the Medical Department of the Shonan Administrative Department</h3>
<p>Shonan, 7th - Central News Agency: Serum for the treatment of diphtheria has previously only been extracted from horses. However, the Medical Department of the Shonan Special Municipality has, after painstaking research, invented a serum that is superior to that of horses. This is a major invention in the world of medicine. This serum is extracted from goats and has been successfully tested repeatedly. In Malaya, Shonan Island, there has always been a shortage of horses, so diphtheria serum has always relied on imports from other places. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, sources from various places have been cut off. The Shonan Special Municipal Government has actively established countermeasures and cultivated diphtheria seedlings in other animals to extract serum. After a long period of research, goat serum was found to have the best composition. After its invention, a research laboratory was established in the Shonan City Infectious Disease Research Institute in January to conduct further in-depth research and analysis. As a result, the collection of goat diphtheria serum has been completely successful.</p>

The sole purpose of this trip is to present his preliminary report, which includes his observations in India over the past few months.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the British White Paper Presented to India</h3>
<p>Regarding British policy towards India, the British political circles are quite dissatisfied with the powerlessness and incompetence of British Prime Minister Churchill and Indian Affairs Minister Amery, and even the American media have criticized them. To cope with this dissatisfaction and criticism, the Indian government released a long document slandering Gandhi and the National Congress Party on March 24. The London Indian Affairs Department also issued a White Paper at 11:00 PM on the same day, with a full text of 50,000 words. The purpose of the White Paper is none other than to say that because Gandhi and the National Congress Party resolutely resist the British policies of oppression imposed on India for many years, and are determined to move towards the realization of so-called "complete freedom," the Indian government, in addition to regarding the Congress Party as rebellious elements and dealing with them thoroughly, has no conciliatory policies to speak of. In particular, because Gandhi's hunger strike and the Indian Governor-General Linlithgow's disregard for the requests from the British political circles and other progressive parties in the Allied camp regarding unconditional release, Churchill's Indian policy is being criticized. The Indian government regards Gandhi's request as a "riot" and aims to persuade the British people that there is no other option but to suppress it, in order to defend itself. However, due to the release of this White Paper, we cannot but believe that the British government, in view of the fact that the anti-British struggle of the Indian people, led by Gandhi and the National Congress Party, has become fierce and Axis-oriented, is crying out in despair.</p>
<p>In its conclusion, the British White Paper on India still uses the usual method, based on the policy of divide and rule, to mention that Muslims, students, etc., did not participate in the disturbances, and that labor groups maintained "self-restraint" to a comparative extent, etc. However, these are just distorted fabrications of the actual situation in India, which clearly contradict the first half of the White Paper. In short, the British government's intention to subject India to even more violent imperialist oppression than before, and to forever make India a British colony, this inhumane ambition has been clearly exposed by the release of this White Paper. The contents of the White Paper are as follows:</p>
<p>Contents of the White Paper</p>
<p>On April 19, 1942, Gandhi openly demanded that the British government withdraw from India. Subsequently, until the meeting of the Congress Party Committee in Bombay on August 7, the Congress Party's supreme command or the entire organization of the party systematically prepared the foundation for a mass movement, with the ultimate goal of liberating India from British rule. Although Gandhi is regarded as the source of the non-violent movement, he is well aware that the Indian people cannot practice the non-violent movement after all. Gandhi and the disciples of Gandhi in the Congress Party must speak of the non-violent movement when referring to the style of the Congress Party's movement, which is nothing more than pious hope.</p>
<p>Later, Gandhi officially stated: "The presence of the British in India is no different from requesting the Japanese army to invade India, so the withdrawal of the British from India is a prerequisite." Later, Gandhi seemed to have agreed to the stationing of Allied troops in India, but the two fundamental motives that formed the basis of his proposal cannot be taken lightly. The first is to hope to finally liberate India from British rule, and the second is to hope that India must avoid becoming a battlefield for the actual fighting between Japan and Britain. Needless to say, Gandhi himself did not believe that India could be defended only with non-violent movements, but he completely disbelieved that the Allies could defend India against the Japanese army. Further considering it, assuming that Gandhi and the members of the Congress Party hoped that the Allied army had the strength to defend India, Gandhi himself still declared that whether the Allied army could fight effectively must be determined by the establishment of an appropriate provisional government or other means. However, such a provisional government seems to be completely dominated by a faction standing on a defeatist point of view, and the leader of that faction has not already declared that he is prepared to negotiate with the Japanese government?</p>
<p>The leaders of the Congress Party all said that only when Britain is in danger will the Congress Party have the opportunity to achieve its goals over the years, and they believe that before the fate of the Allied countries turns from a precarious situation, they must seize the opportunity for the Congress Party to realize its political demands. Can this be denied?</p>
<p>If we review Gandhi's speeches and essays, he had already firmly resolved on his final struggle before July; if we quote Gandhi's own words, there was no room for retreat and no room for negotiation. That is, there is no longer a question of giving another opportunity to observe the effect. In short, the movement that Gandhi attempted was "open rebellion," a "struggle to end foreign rule in India from now on, even at any sacrifice, is the final struggle." He attempted an unarmed rebellion; he expected to quickly and surely throw the entire country of India into a great fire in a short period of time, implementing riots in the process; and if necessary, he even had the determination to implement a general strike.</p>
<p>Gandhi's struggle plan envisioned all the means of a non-violent mass movement, including strikes, cutting off railways, etc., and further attempted to hinder the movement of British troops, especially attempting to maximize the use of the current dissatisfaction of Indians with Britain. At dawn on August 9, Gandhi and other Congress Party leaders were arrested in Bombay. At the same time, influential Congress Party leaders across India were arrested. However, the total number of Congress Party leaders arrested did not exceed 900. Subsequently, the Congress Party continued to assert its argument, saying that the disturbances were caused by the suppression of the Indian government; however, since this disturbance, the first move of the government was only the above-mentioned collective arrest.</p>
<p>At the time of the aforementioned arrest, disturbances occurred in various places such as Madras Province, Bombay Province, Bihar Province, Central Province, and the United Provinces, and the scope of damage was extremely wide. The special equipment used and the sudden and unexpected violence were unimaginable. Furthermore, referring to many examples, it can be seen that these destructive works were based on a lot of technical knowledge. For example, when sabotaging railways, the targets were specifically interlocking devices and switch rooms. Similarly, its technical skill can be seen repeatedly, whether in selecting attack targets or in implementing attack methods. Moreover, the areas where the greatest disturbances occurred were also extremely important places militarily, which cannot be taken lightly. For example, riots broke out in the center of India's coal mining industry, and directly behind the area most exposed to Japanese military attacks.</p>
<p>If the supply of coal stops, India's transportation industry and general industry will be paralyzed. If the rear communication of the defense forces located on the east coast of India is disrupted, there is no better target for attack. However, in the first week after the arrest of the Congress Party leaders, there were relatively few major disturbances in the provinces of Assam, Orissa, Punjab, and the Northwest Frontier Province. Moreover, the student groups participating in the disturbance were without exception limited to Hindu students, who often served as the vanguard of the disturbance. This violence cannot be regarded as the violence of simple thugs. Moreover, Muslims hardly participated in this disturbance, and the labor masses generally maintained "self-restraint," except for those who succumbed to political oppression.</p>
<p>When the first stage of the mass rebellion came to an end, three new trends were clear at the same time. The first is the manifestation of a genuine non-violent, non-military disobedience movement, the second is the occurrence of serious crimes, and the third is a shift to terrorist acts.</p>
<p>Arson, arson, and the murder of officials, violence, etc., occurred one after another. Bombing incidents have occurred in Bombay Province, the United Provinces, and the Central Provinces. Although these acts of violence did not have significant effects at first, they rapidly showed technical improvement. By the twelfth week after the start of the movement, bombs or other explosive devices were used, especially in Bombay Province, where the use was quite extensive. By the end of November, the Congress Party organization was completely underground. The left-wing leaders of the Congress Party took on the important task of guiding the movement. What they did completely disregarded the general safety and well-being of the Indian people. The Indian government still has a lot of information on hand, but in view of the current situation, most of the evidence cannot be made public.</p>
<p>Highlights of the White Paper</p>
<p>The British government announced to the world through its published White Paper the following points:</p>
<p>(1) It is confirmed that the National Congress Party, the most powerful political group in India, under the guidance of Gandhi, has established its policy of resolutely driving the British rule out of India with a determination to sacrifice to the end, regardless of life, and that there is absolutely no room for compromise with the Indian government.</p>
<p>(2) Although Gandhi has always been known to the world as an "apostle of non-violence," he has finally made a final decision regarding the Indian government's insatiable policies of oppression, and has the tragic awareness of inevitably resorting to a certain amount of rioting.</p>
<p>(3) Gandhi and the members of the Congress Party are not only not deceived by the British and American propaganda of "evil Japan," but even express their willingness to negotiate with Japan.</p>
<p>(4) The British government has repeatedly requested India's full assistance in carrying out the world war, but the Indian people, especially the Congress Party, are based on the recognition that "Britain's crisis is an excellent opportunity for Indian independence," and have seen through that the Allied army has no ability to defend India after all.</p>
<p>(5) The scale of the Congress Party's current movement is extremely large, and it is organized. It has seriously hindered Britain's war efforts, which regard India as a treasure trove. (Translated by Ding from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun of March 29)</p>
<h3>Japanese Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Useless White Paper</p>
<p>On March 24th, the Indian government issued a white paper with the aim of defending its cruel suppression of the Indian people. Following this, on the 26th, the Home Secretary of the Indian government, Maxwell, officially stated to the members of the National Congress Party that they would continue their policy of suppression without pretense.</p>
<p>The masses of India, now led by their guiding class, are seizing this world-historical turning point, hard to come by in a thousand battles, to strive to break free from British shackles and create their new destiny. This is the second war of independence since 1857. The British know this well, so they know that it is no longer possible to deceive Indians with empty promises. Therefore, the British refuse to budge an inch on anything that the Indians demand, be it independence or a new constitution, always using the phrase "must wait until after the war to discuss" as a prerequisite, and focus solely on the policy of suppression. In other words, they are unable to satisfy the Indians and want to crush their fighting spirit with violence. As Maxwell said, even with the arrest and imprisonment of over 28,000 members of the National Congress Party, the fervor of the independence movement has not waned. So, how will they deal with it? Although the National Congress Party boasts of having millions of members, the arrest and imprisonment of 28,000 of them is almost like wiping out its leadership. Yet, in Gandhi's base of Ahmedabad, which is under imprisonment, it is necessary to newly promulgate martial law. What does this mean? The Indian independence movement is no longer what the British used to mock, saying it was merely the agitation of a few nationalists. Now, the spirit of independence has deeply penetrated the lower strata of the people.</p>
<p>The British may think that the white paper they issued on the 24th can justify their brutal behavior, but the only ones who are deceived by the shallow sophistry of the British today are the British themselves. Because neither the Indians nor the world today are blind or deaf. Since Queen Victoria, how many promises have there been regarding Indian autonomy? For example, the so-called first self-government system was implemented in 1921. At that time, King George V said: "This is the beginning of self-governing independence within my empire." However, the irony is that that Indian self-government system turned out to be endless. It's like repaying half of a loan in installments with no end in sight. When the second self-government bill was submitted to the British Parliament, the current Prime Minister Churchill, though in opposition, did his best to destroy the bill. At that time, he said: "It is harmful and useless to give Indian politicians hope for independence and complete autonomy. When this kind of thing will be possible, there is no way to imagine." His reason was clear: "The loss of India would be a fatal blow to the British Empire. My competitors are all eagerly waiting for the opportunity." This is Churchill's true intention, which is also the true intention of British imperialists. Now, the Indian government hastily issued a piece of legal theory, but what is it defending after all? What is it acknowledging?</p>
<p>For the Indians, the arrow has already left the string. The British, just like in all other foreign relations, have abandoned their disguise in India and exposed their selfish and cruel nature. They have returned to the British of the Clive-Hastings era. This is like a wounded beast. The way to deal with it is not to reason with it, but only to shoot it dead. (Ding: Translated from the editorial of the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun on March 29)</p>
<p>The Contradiction of the British White Paper</p>
<p>The British government issued a white paper on March 24th, clarifying its position on countermeasures against the Indian independence movement. According to it, the motive of the independence movement lies in completely liberating India from British rule and hoping to avoid using India as a battlefield. To achieve this goal, an organized anti-British movement is underway.</p>
<p>The white paper criticizes these two motives, paying particular attention to the organized anti-British movement, and concludes that it is a full-scale rebellion. Therefore, it believes that it is necessary to thoroughly suppress it.</p>
<p>When we read the argument in this white paper, we cannot help but feel very strange. That is because what we consider to be the most appropriate and justifiable is being strongly criticized by the British.</p>
<p>Where exactly are the two desires mentioned in the white paper as the motives of the Indian independence movement wrong? The so-called seemingly organized riotous behavior is nothing more than the result of Britain's own lack of understanding and oppression of India.</p>
<p>In order to carry out a war that is difficult to win, Britain is engaging in unreasonable activities all over the world. Within India, it is taking away most of the food and forcibly conscripting strong men into military service. The various heavy pressures are difficult to describe. Therefore, the seemingly organized anti-British resistance in India is actually caused by the life-and-death suffering of the entire people.</p>
<p>If Britain did not engage in this kind of oppression and abuse, then India would not be in distress and hunger, and could have calmly transcended the flames of war. Cunning and scheming Britain is now inevitably experiencing the feeling of a monkey falling from a tree. The Japanese, of course, can easily understand and sympathize with the Indian position. Britain, which wants to achieve its extravagant hopes, will ultimately not be tolerated by the Indians. That is one of the major reasons for Britain's decline. Simply put, the anti-British movement in India is based on the seeds they themselves have sown. The still arrogant Britain, with its sense of superiority and contempt for the Indian people, will definitely not apply even the empty name of independence stipulated in the Atlantic Charter to India. (Ding: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, March 28)</p>
<p>The Historical Significance of the White Paper</p>
<p>Recently, the strategic warfare of Britain and the United States has revealed a vague document called the Atlantic Charter, babbling about the management of the post-war world, as if the victory of the anti-Axis powers is inevitable. Unfortunately, this painstakingly planned strategy has revealed flaws in the face of reality. The disputes over the post-war disposition of Poland and other small countries are one example. The exposure of the British-Indian relationship due to the publication of the white paper on the 24th is another example.</p>
<p>In particular, the latter most clearly exposes the shortcomings of Anglo-American democracy and is worthy of our attention. We believe that the significance of this white paper lies in the fact that the British-Indian relationship, taking the Greater East Asia War as an opportunity, will produce a epoch-making change. At the same time, Britain itself formally acknowledges in an official document that it does not have the ability to handle the Indian problem. In the history of the Indian independence movement, there are three facts that promoted the awakening of the Indian nation. First, the Russo-Japanese War; second, the First European War; third, the current Greater East Asia War. The current Greater East Asia War has shaken the foundation of British colonialism in East Asia for three centuries and has given the Indian nation a particularly deep impression. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan, which has accomplished unprecedented achievements, does not rely on its merits to show off its power. First, it has gradually implemented its promises to China, reflecting the words of Britain and the United States without action, and exposing the essence of Anglo-American anti-Indian propaganda, causing Britain and the United States to lose the theoretical basis for aiding Chiang Kai-shek. Secondly, Japan's policies towards the southern nations have made the East Asia policies of Britain and the Netherlands a clear contrast to Japan's East Asia policies, opening the eyes of the Indian nation. Third, and most importantly, Japan fulfilled its promise to allow Burma to become independent. The Burmese nation, trapped in the shackles of the long-standing British Empire like the Indian nation, will now gain glorious independence, while the Indian nation still groans under the heavy pressure of the British Empire. These iron-like realities have raised their spirit of independence and changed their perception of Japan.</p>
<p>Japan's achievements in the Greater East Asia War and its policies towards the East Asian nations have externally promoted the awakening of the Indian nation, while Mahatma Gandhi's hunger strike has internally promoted their national self-awareness, drawing a decisive line between them and the oppressor Britain. Britain's indifference to this old saint's life-or-death protest is a fatal blunder by Britain. Because of this cold attitude of Britain, the Indian people, Gandhi, have no room for negotiation in a compromise between Britain and India. Helping Britain to carry out the war only further aggravated the oppression of the Indian people, thus confirming that non-violent resistance is by no means the way to complete the liberation of the Indian nation. The true friend is the one who comes from the East on a white horse. This traditional belief of the Indian people will therefore become stronger. We believe that the current white paper cannot adapt to the above-mentioned facts. Before these facts, Britain frankly admits that it is completely powerless. This is something with historical significance. (Sho: Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, Tokyo, March 29)</p>

<h3>The Next Ration of Rice for Households is rumored to be distributed with Broad Beans. It is rumored that each person can purchase one catty at a price of $1.90.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, our reporter learned from the rice industry that the sales slips received by the rice shops this time include broad beans in addition to rice and flour. It is rumored that the quantity of rice is about the same as in the previous period, but the quantity of flour may be slightly reduced. The exact distribution, quantity, and price are subject to the official announcement today. As for the allocation of broad beans, it is stipulated that they can be purchased with the previously issued grain certificates. Each certificate can purchase one catty at a price of $1.90, sold concurrently by the contracting rice shops. All residents of the two concessions who hold grain certificates can purchase them from the same rice shop as indicated on the certificate.</p>
<p>The Sales Slips for the 32nd Ration have been Issued</p>
<p>Since the authorities implemented the policy of rationing food based on population to maintain the food supply in Shanghai, the 31st ration for households has been distributed by 665 contracting rice shops in the two concessions in accordance with the regulations since April 2nd.

Regarding the 32nd ration for households, the contracting rice shops received the sales slips yesterday and have already started making payments and picking up goods from the designated warehouses. It will be sold from the 11th to the 19th upon presentation of certificates.</p>
<p>The Second Batch of Cooking Oil will continue to be sold this Month</p>
<p>Since the Cooking Oil Association Wholesale Department implemented the policy of rationing cooking oil based on house tax tickets, the situation has been good. In order to meet the needs of the people, the association has been actively communicating and the second batch of 500 tons of goods has arrived at the port the day before yesterday. It is generally expected that it will continue to be sold after the first batch of sales ends on the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>The Next Ration of Sugar for Households will be sold from the 11th</p>
<p>Since the implementation of population-based sugar rationing in the city at the beginning of last month, the sugar panic in this port has disappeared. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the second ration of sugar for households has already been paid for and shipped out by the retailers, and it is decided to start selling it from the 11th upon presentation of the second-period sugar purchase certificate. The quantity is still half a catty per person, and the selling price is $2.40 including tax.</p>
<p>The Rationing of Food throughout the City will be Unified</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who learned from relevant parties in this port, it is said that in the future, the quantity of rice, flour, sugar, oil, and miscellaneous grains rationed to residents throughout the city will gradually become uniform. As of now, the amount of sugar and oil that residents in each district can receive is the same, but there are still differences between the concession area and the city area in terms of rice and flour.</p>
<p>The Second Phase of Sugar Sales is widespread in the City Area</p>
<p>The second phase of population-based sugar sales in the city area has been ordered by the City Food Bureau to be prepared by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office. It is scheduled to be widely sold in each district from the 11th of this month to the end of the month. Except for the Nanshi and Huxi districts, which are still handled by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, the other districts will be directly supervised by the Food Bureau. It is also heard that sugar public sales offices have been established in Pudong and the city center to prevent malpractices. As for the amount of sugar sold, it is still stipulated to be half a catty per person, and the selling price is still calculated at $4.70 per catty in Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>
<h3>Director of Information Department Hirota gave a speech yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy, as usual, hosted a group of Chinese journalists from this city. Director of Information Hirota and Deputy Consul Fukuma presided over the meeting. Navy Information Director Colonel Kamakyū and Lieutenant Tanaka were also present.</p>
<p>The Shipping Power from India to Chongqing is Weak</p>
<p>During the meeting, Director of Information Hirota delivered a speech, saying: "British Foreign Secretary Eden has completed his visit to the United States on the 5th of this month and has returned to England. This task has come to an end, but Eden's result of coordinating the treaty relationship with the United States has yielded nothing. We can see the attitude of Britain and the United States, as well as the influence of Chongqing on Britain and the United States. In addition, we can see the extent of the Soviet Union's support for Chongqing. The expectation of Chongqing itself is to ensure the supply of British, American, and Soviet military equipment and diplomatic assistance. However, under the difficult transport routes, it is difficult to have large-scale assistance. Chongqing relies on the supply of the Yunnan-Burma Road. Since the Japanese army blocked the Burma Road last year, it has relied on the air route from India across the Himalayas to Chongqing. The power is weak, so it has actively requested supplies and assistance from the United States, supplying 500 fighter planes, as well as 75,000 tons of gasoline and other materials. The chairman of the American Lease Army Committee has specifically stated this.</p>
<p>The Transport of Ships also has to consider Submarines</p>
<p>After our practical assessment, Chongqing's supply of gasoline via the India-Chongqing air route requires no less than a thousand transport planes. Assuming that one plane carries ten tons, it consumes two and a half tons on the India-Chongqing route, leaving only seven and a half tons. Once a month, it must go back and forth ten times. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for Britain and the United States to assist Chongqing. The British Treasury also clearly understands this. However, Britain and the United States need a lot of planes for operations in their own territories, North Africa, the South Pacific, and other places, so it is difficult to assist Chongqing with a thousand planes. If transporting by sea by ship, there is also the threat of German submarines. Moreover, Britain and the United States are preoccupied with operations in the South, and are even more unable to restore the Burma Road. Therefore, they cannot fulfill their expectations for Chongqing. Although Chongqing still hopes for assistance, even with Soong Mei-ling's visit to the United States and Bao Yingqing's visit to England, it is difficult to achieve their wishes even with diplomatic maneuvers.</p>
<p>The Policy Decided at the Roosevelt-Churchill Conference</p>
<p>The Roosevelt-Churchill conference in Casablanca decided that Britain and the United States would prioritize the European issue. Under these circumstances, it is a dream for Chongqing to seek assistance from Britain and the United States. Helping the Allies with the British-American policy is meaningless in the final stage. What is even more strange is that although its foreign work is allied with Britain and the United States, it is difficult to seek special assistance from Britain and the United States in pursuing its own foreign policy. Therefore, even with active diplomatic efforts, it has not achieved good results.</p>
<p>The Estrangement among the Three Countries has not been Eliminated</p>
<p>Recently, British Foreign Secretary Eden visited the United States. We estimate that his purpose was to adjust the estrangement among Britain, the the United States, and the Soviet Union and to formulate a fundamental strategy for combat. According to Britain's attitude towards the Soviet Union, Britain recognizes the Soviet Union's ambitions for small countries such as Europe, Poland, and Finland, sacrificing the territory of small and weak countries, and allowing the expansion of Red Soviet forces throughout Europe. This point has been clearly revealed in speeches by British Prime Minister Churchill and editorials in the London Times. The Soviet Union is allowed to expand communism in small European countries. However, the attitude of the United States towards the Soviet Union is divided into two factions: pro-Soviet and anti-Soviet. The pro-Soviet faction recognizes the Soviet Union's aggressive territorial ambitions, while the anti-Soviet faction is composed of American capitalists, Catholics, and conservatives, opposing Soviet communism and general policies. Therefore, the US government has not expressed a clear attitude towards the Soviet Union due to the mutual influence of the two factions. Therefore, British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to the United States has achieved nothing.</p>
<p>Restoring Co-prosperity from an East Asian Standpoint</p>
<p>The Atlantic Charter announced by Britain stipulates an agreement to provide independence and freedom to small and weak countries and to guarantee them. However, Churchill's statement that small countries should be sacrificed for Allied operations is extremely contradictory to this Charter. Although the Soviet Union can gain assistance due to Churchill's expression, and due to the United States' hesitation, it is also difficult for the Soviet Union to obtain consistent assistance from Britain and the United States. However, our claim is that Chongqing should not stand outside the East Asian standpoint. To restore East Asian co-prosperity, it must sever the root of its relationship with the world's culprits, Britain and the United States, and reflect on its own renewal.</p>
<h3>Silk and Cloth Industry Checks Measuring Tools, Preventing Variations in Violation of Appraisals</h3>
<p>The registration of inventory by silk and cloth shops in this city has been completed by the industry association. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the industry has decided to implement inspections of the measuring tools used in order to prevent merchants from engaging in activities that vary and violate appraisals.</p>
<h3>Pedestrians are Absolutely not Allowed to Cross the Road</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions are strictly managing the traffic rules for residents in order to avoid danger and ensure safety first. The Public Concession has increased the number of police officers at key traffic roads, with six to eight officers directing traffic, absolutely prohibiting pedestrians from crossing the road and requiring them to walk on the sidewalk on the left. At the same time, the vehicles are also strictly directed, and they are absolutely not allowed to run red lights or cross the road. Violations will be punished in accordance with the regulations. In addition, the Air Defense Traffic Section dispatched police officers to form special traffic teams to assist the police in directing traffic at the Sanxiao intersections and busy areas. In the French Concession, in addition to increasing the number of police officers directing traffic, warning lines have also been set up on the section of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Joffre, with civilian police assisting in directing pedestrians to walk on the sidewalk on the left. The implementation has been going on for many days, and dangerous incidents have been sharply reduced.</p>
<h3>The names on Ship Tickets to Ningbo must match. Passengers must first recognize, in order to avoid trouble</h3>
<p>The number of passengers traveling from this port to Ningbo is increasing every day, making ship tickets difficult to purchase. According to Wang Chunji Travel Agency, in order to facilitate the purchase of tickets for groups and institutions and to avoid overcrowding, groups or commercial firms traveling to Ningbo as a group can submit a letter with a seal from the person in charge to apply for the purchase of tickets. It is also learned that in order to eliminate scalping and price gouging, starting from this ship, the identity cards of passengers on board, or the residence permits issued by Ningbo, will be checked to see if they match the name on the ship ticket. Once it is found that there is a substitute or false use, they will be ordered to make up for the ticket and will be given appropriate punishment. Therefore, passengers traveling to Ningbo in the future must recognize whether the changed name on the ticket is their own name, so as to avoid trouble after boarding the ship.</p>
<h3>Nanshi plans to install Cheap Tap Water. Folk Wells will be blocked</h3>
<p>The Nanshi office of the Health Bureau is now planning to install cheap tap water in order to eliminate epidemics, so that the common people's drinks this summer will not be drawn from well water again. The office specially discussed this matter with the mayors of each ward in Nanshi yesterday afternoon. Deputy Director Yang Zhengzhi of the office presided over the meeting, and representatives from the China Water &amp; Electric Company also attended the meeting. As a result, they unanimously expressed their support for the installation of cheap tap water. It is heard that once it is implemented, all the folk wells in the entire Nanshi area will be blocked separately and the extraction of water will be prohibited in order to contain the source of the epidemic.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department announces the winning Air Defense Slogans</h3>
<p>In order to enable citizens to understand the meaning of air defense, the Public Works Department plans to show air defense slogans on the screen in various cinemas. The awards were given out yesterday. The first prize winner received a prize of $500: (1) Zhang Lizhang from the Tax Department, slogan "Air defense is the guarantee of life and property." The second prize winners each received a prize of $50: (2) Ou Jingxing from the Health Department, slogan "With 'air defense preparations' you can live and work in peace, without 'air defense preparations' your family will be ruined." (3) Chen Ziwei from Seymour Road Primary School, slogan "Everything is prepared, everywhere is safe, everyone can defend the air, and everyone is free from danger."</p>
<h3>Refusal to sell Rationed Cigarettes will be strictly investigated and punished</h3>
<p>Since the Hua Zhong Tobacco Rationing Association stipulated the limited price for the implementation of cigarette rationing in this port, the black market for cigarettes has gradually subsided. However, most cigarette shops often refuse to sell them on various pretexts, so recently, the average smoker has suffered from the pain of not having cigarettes anywhere, or there are still situations where the limited price is exceeded, which is very wrong. Some stores even often hang wooden signs at the door saying "Rationed cigarettes are sold out" and refuse to sell cigarettes, which is even more unreasonable. The authorities stipulate that whether it is rationed cigarettes or stockpiled cigarettes, they must be sold in accordance with the limited price. It is learned that the authorities are now conducting a strict investigation of these illegal stores, and once the evidence is verified, they will be severely punished and the market will be rectified.</p>

<h3>Thorough Investigation of Speculative Behavior in Shanghai. The decision to punish specially. The Financial Institutions Speculators Closed.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News: The National Government issued an order on the 7th, stating that large-scale speculation and hoarding of important materials has been found in Shanghai recently, which harms society and disrupts the market, which is extremely hateful. Chen Zhishuo, Deputy Minister of Finance, Yuan Yuqian, Deputy Minister of Industry, Zhao Shuyong, Secretary General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and Chen Yunwen, Superintendent of the National Commercial Control Association, are ordered to immediately and impartially investigate thoroughly. If the main staff of financial institutions engage in speculative transactions, if they are government-run, they will be suspended and reorganized immediately. If they are commercially run, they will be closed. All those who engage in speculative transactions, manipulate market prices, and disturb the teachings will be reported to the Supreme National Defense Council for special punishment after the facts have been determined, regardless of who they are. The materials seized will be confiscated in their entirety as a warning to the wicked. This order was issued by Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the National Government, and Wang Zhaoming, Prime Minister of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>The Report of Ancestor Le Shan Public's Medical Benevolence</h3>
<p>— Nie Yuntai</p>
<p>Yuntai Ershi was educated by his mother from a young age (the youngest daughter of Zeng Wenzheng Public), and he often used Zeng Public's poem of "no envy, no greed" to supplement his shortcomings. His family practiced charity for generations, not seeking glory or profit. Although not wealthy, they delighted in doing good deeds, providing schooling, clothing, porridge, tea, and medicine, never tiring. Last winter, he suddenly suffered the loss of his mother, and his grief was immense. Confined to bed with hemoptysis, he still did not forget the suffering of the people during the war. He described the report of Le Shan Public's medical benevolence as the next chapter of "The Method to Preserve Wealth," and thus had it published for like-minded individuals.</p>
<p>Our seventh-generation ancestor, Le Shan Public, whose given name was Ji-mo, was originally from Jiangxi. His grandfather, Qi-long Public, first moved to Hengshan. Public was born in the eleventh year of the Kangxi reign. He excelled in learning and writing but did not take the imperial examinations. He learned medicine from his grandfather and established a small pharmacy. His reputation as a doctor grew, but Public was fond of doing good deeds and giving alms. The pharmacy was robbed and eventually closed down. He pawned his residence and temporarily lived nearby. Local officials and gentry, because Public treated people with medicine, helped him redeem his original residence and rented another house to open a small pharmacy. In the forty-second year of the Kangxi reign, a major epidemic struck Hengshan. Those seeking medicine came day and night, and many were saved. He especially provided relief to poor criminals. Magistrate Ge, recognizing Public's great virtue and erudition, hired him into the county government, saying, "Elder, you have dedicated your heart to saving people. I have no way to repay you. I will ensure your son studies and becomes famous, and that will be my repayment." He then sent Public's son, Xian, to study at the Wenfeng and Jixian Academies. Xian later passed the provincial examination and became a Jinshi.</p>
<p>When Public was sixty-six years old, he led his son to Beijing for the metropolitan examination. Passing through Shekou, there was an epidemic in the severe winter. Public administered medicine and cured everyone immediately. When he was seventy-four years old, he led his son to Beijing for official selection. Traveling north by the Grand Canal, many grain ships were infected with the epidemic. Public gave them medicine and cured them immediately. The boatmen shouted from the sides of the ships, tying Public's boat so it could not leave. Public could not bear to leave them and ordered his son Xian to take a mule cart and proceed ahead by land. Public waited several months until the epidemic subsided before arriving in the capital. (Note: putting aside one's own affairs to save others is most commendable.) At that time, Xian had already been selected as the magistrate of Zhen'an County in Shaanxi. Public accompanied him to his post. The mountain roads of Zhen'an were rugged and arduous. Public rode his horse with ease, appearing as fit as an immortal. At the government office, he instructed the mountain people to gather medicinal herbs to support their livelihoods. The following year, he returned to Hengshan and sent a letter to his son, instructing him on the methods of governing the people and educating the officials. Chen Wengong Public, then serving as the governor of Shaanxi, greatly admired his letter and had it published throughout the province for officials to learn from. This letter was later included in the "Huang Qing Jingshi Wenbian," and is recited by the world. While in Hengshan, Public often entered the county prison to treat the inmates. Even after his son became prominent and wealthy, Public, at the age of eighty, still routinely visited the prison to examine the sick. The county had people decline his services, but Public said, "I enjoy doing it myself." At the age of eighty-four, his son Xian returned home due to mourning for his stepmother. Considering Public's advanced age, he did not go out again.</p>
<p>One night, late at night, someone knocked on the door in the snow, begging him to come for a consultation. His son Xian got up and answered the door, telling the person, "The old man is old and cannot be awakened in the deep night. Come again in the morning." Public overheard the sound and got out of bed, putting on his clothes. He immediately called his son inside and said, "This is an emergency childbirth. How can we delay?" He then put on his clogs and went with him. His heart of selflessly helping others was so sincere and rare in the medical community.</p>
<p>Heaven's rewards to Public were also very generous. Public lived to the age of ninety-three. His grandson Zhao-kui was the second-place candidate in the Qianlong Renzi provincial examination. His great-grandsons Hao-min and Xian were both Hanlin scholars, serving as chief examiners and education commissioners. Jun-min and Yu-min were both successful candidates in the provincial examination, serving as county magistrates. Jing-min was a Ba Gong, Zeng Sheng, and served in a position in the capital. Sa excelled as a Zeng Sheng and was recommended as an upright and filial candidate. At the time, they were known as the "Seven Sons of Hengshan." When the first great-grandmother, Kang Tai-furen, celebrated her seventieth birthday, Ruan Wendagong wrote a congratulatory couplet: "The Southern Peak embodies the spirit, the Southern Slope extends the blessings; seventy years celebrate the Tao, seven sons achieve fame." It was a rare and beautiful story.</p>
<p>The great-grandson, who was our grandfather, his given name Er-kang, styled Yifeng, was a Hanlin scholar in the Xianfeng Guichou year. He served as magistrate of Shicheng and Xinhui counties in Guangdong, and as prefect of Gaozhou Prefecture. He was commended and promoted to the rank of Daotai. He was honest and upright as an official, dedicated to serving the people, and brought blessings to the local area. He accumulated great virtue, and the people erected a living shrine to worship him. I will write another article to describe him. I have often thought about it. Mencius said, "The blessings of a gentleman last for five generations and then cease." Le Shan Public's son was a fourth-generation descendant. The imperial examination success extended to Yifeng Public as the fifth generation. He was also able to diligently cultivate his virtue. It extended to our father, the Central Commissioner, who became even more prominent and wealthy. The unworthy brothers are the seventh generation and still enjoy the legacy. The blessings of Le Shan Public can be said to be long-lasting.</p>
<p>To be able to save people through medicine in Hengshan is already difficult, to be skilled in medicine is even more difficult. Among the famous doctors I have seen in various places, many have accumulated assets of hundreds of thousands or millions. Few can pass it down to the third generation. Even if there are, they must be both skilled in medicine and fond of doing good deeds. Such people are always present. I cannot help but view them with reverence and hope to meet them.</p>
<p>However, many people in the world are shortsighted, and few are fond of doing good and indifferent to profit. Doctors aim to get rich, raising their prices. They do not research the efficacy of the medicine, and they do not care about the poor, sick, and destitute. Pharmacies not only seek profit but also cheat by reducing the amount of expensive medicine. This kind of situation should be warned against if it exists, and encouraged if it does not. Recently, medicine prices have been unusually high, and the sick cannot afford to take medicine. This is the best time to act with convenience. However, how many have the wisdom and foresight to think for their children and descendants? Therefore, I respectfully recount the story of our ancestor Le Shan Public as a recommendation to those in the medical profession.</p>
<p>Le Shan Public saved many lives through his medical skills. The pharmacy was robbed, and he even pawned his house to pay the debts. His lack of wealth is evident. At the age of eighty, his son returned from being a county official, and he still went for consultations in snowy clothes and clogs. His poverty in old age is evident. The Great Learning says, "The benevolent use wealth to develop themselves, while the unbenevolent use themselves to develop wealth." Doctors and pharmacies can all get rich. However, giving free consultations and medicine to poor families will not lead to wealth. Yet, although Public could not get rich, he was able to develop himself. His virtue and reputation flourished in his time, and his fame has been passed down to future generations. Public's deeds are recorded in the Zhen'an County Chronicle of Shaanxi, the Hengzhou Prefecture Chronicle of Hunan, and the Hengshan County Chronicle. His descendants achieved success and wealth for five or six generations. This is what is meant by using wealth to develop oneself.</p>
<h3>Economic Realm</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rubber Merchants Joint Association held a meeting last week, and in addition to making decisions on the allocation of raw materials, it is reported that the following decisions were made regarding the production procedures of various rubber factories: (1) Strictly prioritize military supplies for military preparations, (2) Secondly, prioritize industrial products, (3) Thirdly, prioritize civilian necessities.</p>
<p>The four industry associations of cooked food in oil, cakes and steamed buns, cakes and noodles, and fried dough sticks have newly formed a joint association, which has decided to begin member registration starting from the 6th.</p>
<h3>Commentary: Realizing the Adjustment of Industry Associations</h3>
<p>This column has made many discussions on the question of how to strengthen industry associations. Since industry and commerce associations are the grassroots organizations of the private economy, they bear extremely heavy responsibilities in the wartime economy, and the entire control mechanism, such as the National Commercial Control Association, cannot achieve ideal results without strengthening the power of the industry associations under the General Headquarters. The connection between the Commercial Control Association and the industry and commerce associations in control work must reach the point of "the body directing the arm and the arm directing the finger" to smoothly advance the wartime economic control work.</p>
<p>The Provisional Regulations on Industry and Commerce Associations promulgated by the Ministry of Industry have already clearly stated the responsibilities of industry associations. The Ministry of Industry established yesterday regarding how to classify industry and commerce associations and the organizational procedures for major commodity industry associations and joint associations, shows that the issue of adjusting and strengthening industry associations has begun to enter the stage of realization, and it also shows that the authorities are courageous in adopting public opinion.</p>
<p>We said in the commentary on March 19: "In the future, the same industry should urgently stipulate a uniform industry association, correct the name, and hold several fair, honest, and reputable leaders in the industry responsible for organizing." Now that the Industry and Commerce Association Reorganization Committee has been established, there is someone to guide them consciously. I hope that the gentlemen of the Reorganization Committee will pay more attention to the "fair and honest" backbones in the associations of various industries as objects for mutual consultation in the guidance and supervision.</p>
<h3>Commercial Control Association's Organization is Ready, Actively Carrying Out Control Work</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai: Since its establishment, the National Commercial Control Association has been actively carrying out the work of material control. All implementation essentials and the material purchase and allocation system have been approved by the first meeting of the Material Control Review Committee and are being further researched and reviewed by the Material Control Review Committee and the Executive Committee. The latest situation of the association is divided into the following:</p>
<p>Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Completed</p>
<p>In order to implement material control, the association first handled the registration of cotton yarn and cloth inventory of Chinese and Japanese merchants, which ended on the 2nd of this month. On the Chinese merchant side, the Yarn Factory Association, the Yarn Industry Association, the Cloth Industry Association, and the Dyeing Industry Association have submitted the yarn and cloth inventory registration forms filled out by their members to the Commercial Control Association. On the Japanese merchant side, the Japanese Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Industry has submitted the registration forms to the Commercial Control Association. The statistical procedures are currently being handled. All registered inventory of yarn and cloth merchants has been temporarily suspended from movement in accordance with the orders of the authorities.</p>
<p>Applications for Material Movement Are Increasing Daily</p>
<p>Since the Material Movement Permit Office of the association began handling material movement permit applications on March 16, many Chinese and Japanese merchants in the city have applied to the office for movement in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the authorities. The association has reviewed and issued permits, and the number of approved material movement events has reached more than a thousand to date. In recent days, the number of applications for movement has been even more numerous than before.</p>
<p>Internal Organization Largely Ready</p>
<p>Regarding the internal organizational system of the association, it has been approved by the last Material Control Review Meeting. It was decided that under the chairman of the board of directors, there would be a secretary-general, secretary, commissioners, advisors, reviewers, etc. In addition to the administrative departments, there will be four departments: General Affairs, Review, Materials, and Finance. The General Affairs Department is divided into a Documentation Group, a Conference Affairs Group, a Visa Group, and a General Affairs Group. The Review Department is divided into a Movement Review Group and a Material Review Group. The Materials Department is divided into an Exchange Group, a Registration Group, a Purchase and Storage Group, and a Sales Group. The Finance Department is divided into a Dispatch Group, an Accounting Group, and a Revenue and Expenditure Group. A total of four departments and fifteen groups are working. Other professional departments are composed of specialized research committees established by each unit reorganized from various industry and commerce associations or joint associations.</p>
<h3>Central China Revitalization Company Holds a Board of Directors and Supervisors Symposium</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai: After Mr. Takashima took office as the new president of the Central China Revitalization Company, the first symposium for directors and supervisors of the Revitalization Company and related companies was held on the 6th as the first day. At 10:00 a.m., the symposium was held in the conference room of the Central China Revitalization Company. The attendees from the Revitalization Company included President Takashima, Director Sonoda, Director Ban-no, Director Aburaya, and related directors and supervisors.

<h3>Yokohama Specie Bank Recovers Military Scrip, Exceeding 10 Million Yuan Per Day</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai: The recovery procedures after the cessation of new military scrip issuance are currently progressing smoothly. In the week from April 1 to 7, the amount of military scrip flowing into the Yokohama Specie Bank exceeded 10 million yen per day. It is reported that most of the military scrip recovered by the Yokohama Specie Bank comes from various Japanese banks. Since the new issuance of military scrip has been stopped, its economic scope will be greatly reduced. It is expected that various Japanese banks will use specific methods such as raising interest rates to attract Chinese funds. In addition, the buying and selling of drafts previously concentrated in the Yokohama Specie Bank will be handled by Japanese Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Korea, Taiwan, and other banks in the future.</p>

<h3>Osaka Cotton Yarn and Artificial Fiber Control Association Plans to Establish a North China Cotton Corps</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th Central News Agency: According to a telephone call from Osaka, the Cotton Yarn and Artificial Fiber Control Association here held a Raw Materials Committee and a Council Meeting at the Cotton Industry Hall on the 6th to discuss various countermeasures regarding the increase in cotton production in North China. As a result, it was decided to establish a cotton corps as the central agency of the association. The corps will integrate all cotton-related agencies in North China and will be established with investment from Chinese and Japanese officials, with a planned investment of 100 million yuan, to handle (1) guidance on cotton cultivation, (2) cultivation and procurement, (3) determination and adjustment of prices, (4) development of alkaline land, etc. The Control Association is currently working hard to realize the corps as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the National Commercial Control Association (II)</h3>
<p>— Jian Yan</p>
<p>(2) Strive to Achieve the Goal of Increased Production: The purpose of the Commercial Control Association is to increase production and solve the people's livelihood through control. Restricting the movement of materials is because the inventory of materials is small, and it is necessary to establish preservation in a passive way to avoid the interruption of related industries. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the Commercial Control Association is still the ordinary increase in production of related industries. In order to achieve the goal of increased production, the types of restricted items should be as few as possible. Currently, the items that have been promulgated to restrict movement include 14 categories: automobiles and parts, gasoline and petroleum, machinery, communication materials, metals, medicines, rubber, gauze, candles, matches, soap, sugar, cotton, and rice. Except for these 14 categories, unless absolutely necessary, it is not advisable to increase them again, so as not to hinder the circulation of goods and reduce production. In terms of actively increasing production, the Commercial Control Association should first pay attention to promoting the exchange of materials between Central China, North China, and South China, so as to dredge the source of raw materials and directly increase industrial production. The reason why prices are so expensive at present is due to many factors, but the lack of materials is one of the main reasons. The lack of materials is due to reduced production, and reduced production is due to insufficient raw materials. Therefore, in recent years, the price of raw materials has risen so quickly that it sometimes exceeds that of manufactured products (such as mineral raw materials, the index increased to 8251 in December 31, while the index of manufactured products such as machinery was occasionally 5190). Generally, factories, in view of the rapid rise in the price of raw materials compared with manufactured products, do not actively produce, but turn to hoarding raw materials; because the profit that can be obtained from selling raw materials is far more favorable than selling products. Due to the existence of this abnormal state, the lack of materials is becoming more serious, and the high price is endless. Therefore, if the Commercial Control Association can promote the exchange of materials between Central China, North China, and South China, the difficulty of the lack of raw materials can be alleviated considerably. As far as we know, the materials in North China that can be transported south include coal, oil, oilseeds, raw hides, tobacco leaves, alkali, cotton, wool, and raw iron; the materials in South China that can be transported north include coconut dry, cowhide, raw silk, and wood. If these raw materials can be exchanged with the remaining yarn and cloth in Central China and various light industrial manufactured products, then (1) the cost of industrial power in the Central China area can be reduced, and the price of general industrial products can be reduced; (2) general factories can restore their normal output due to the limited supply of raw materials and reduced production; (3) industries such as over-cloud spinning, dyeing and weaving, cigarettes, soap, wool weaving, oil extraction, and silk weaving can be restarted because of the lack of raw materials. Therefore, if the Commercial Control Association can truly achieve the realization of material exchange between Central China, North China, and South China, its benefits to the national economy and the people's livelihood are immeasurable.</p>

<h3>Environment and Psychology</h3>
<p>— Zongwen</p>
<p>The environment is objective, and psychology is subjective. The conditions that form the environment are political systems, economic institutions, and social classes. The conditions that change psychology are academic ability, experience, will, thought, heredity, and imagination. However, the two are mutually causal and have a close relationship. The decision of the environment has psychological reasons, and the change of psychology is influenced by the power of the environment. However, psychology is a subjective willpower, and the environment is an objective social force. Subjective willpower can overcome objective social forces. But the objective environment determines the subjective psychology.</p>
<p>The concrete manifestations of environment and psychology are in society and thought, but thought is a reflection of social life, so the foundation of psychology is still in the environment. With psychological sadness, one will feel melancholy in the environment. Because of the depression in the environment, one will increase the psychological sorrow.</p>
<p>The youth who misunderstands the environment, suffers setbacks and difficulties, not only does not strive to fight bravely on the journey of life, but refuses the lessons of the environment and goes to the abnormal road, showing a negative psychology.</p>
<p>You see, those youths who are unwilling to accept the environment to train him, his will is negative and decadent, his psychology is disappointed and regretful, dissatisfied with the current environment, hates the darkness of society, and is immersed in the enjoyment of the pleasures of sound and color, dogs and horses, and the catharsis of carnal desire, gradually sacrificing his life under the joy of this abnormal psychology. Some youths in this environment specialize in making rash actions based on their illusions, and as a result, they are also squeezed out of the survival circle by this society. This kind of reactionary phenomenon and abnormal physiology is because they misunderstood the environment.</p>
<p>There is another kind of youth who can grasp the correct understanding of the environment, work tirelessly in hardship, have perseverance, have thought, can use the environment to train their own will, enrich their own experience, and finally can break the unfortunate environment, conquer the bad environment, and achieve success in their careers.</p>
<p>This kind of person who can use the environment to strengthen his will is often the great men we sing about in history.</p>
<p>The times are evolving, the environment is changing, the psychology is changing, society is dynamic, and when the feudal society collapses, a new society will be established. In such an environment, we should not have an abnormal psychology!</p>
<p>We need to use the spirit of science and the attitude of seeking truth to improve our psychological state, transform our bad environment, and not be tempted by vanity and fame.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk</h3>
<p>— Qi Luo</p>
<p>The gently persuasive "admonition" is the lubricating oil we lack; the "idle talk" of bystanders is the coarse sand we do not need. With oil, we can proceed smoothly; with sand, we will only be frustrated or stagnated.</p>
<p>We often like to say "idle talk" about other people. However, we must not have considered that when we are doing something, other people's "idle talk" will also come one after another. If the person involved is a very confident and decisive person, it will not be a big obstacle. If it is an indecisive person, then he is likely to wander on the way, without any success, and get the worst results.</p>
<p>To make a clumsy metaphor: "Idle talk" is like a snobbish dog. The more ragged you wear, the more it barks and makes a lot of noise. The more you are in the abyss, the more "idle talk" will come. So, there is a saying in our country: "Victory is king, defeat is bandit." This is the effect of "idle talk"!</p>
<p>We don't have to complain about others saying "idle talk", as long as we don't say "idle talk" about others. If everyone can do this, "idle talk" will naturally disappear.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of our own and others' future, we must strive to restrain ourselves and not say "idle talk" about others.</p>
<p>We need gently persuasive "admonition"; we do not want the "idle talk" of bystanders.</p>
<h3>"Subconsciousness"</h3>
<p>— Qi Luo</p>
<p>Usually, many things are accomplished by "subconsciousness"; but more things fail because of "subconsciousness."</p>
<p>Often, when we do something, there is an invisible force that dominates us, and this is the effect of "subconsciousness."</p>
<p>"Subconsciousness," also known as "unconsciousness," is a kind of consciousness hidden in the heart; it is a kind of special emotion. Everyone has it, but it varies from person to person due to different knowledge, cultivation, and sentiment. It runs away suddenly and disappears suddenly. Reason is powerless to control it, nor can it prevent it. It can occasionally achieve victory, but if its success is contrary to the law, then it is a crime. Therefore, it has created many unfortunate losers.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should usually pay attention to the cultivation of knowledge, cultivation, and sentiment to create a stronger reason. Do not let "subconsciousness" show up often.</p>
<h3>Root</h3>
<p>— Xinbo</p>
<p>"In the Huang family, there isn't a moment of freedom—and even working to death yields no results, no one even says a good word. I really don't want to continue! They're rich, but I don't want to keep watching. And I don't think their wealth will last long, because there isn't a single good person among them. Such a family is bound to fail!"</p>
<p>"Really?" Dagen said, holding a full teacup, staring at the steam above the water. After a while, the water surface cleared up a bit, seemingly about to become clear. But immediately, a layer of white film formed again, cracking into pieces, then turning into vapor, rising and dissipating in the air. He watched several times, as if he were entranced.</p>
<p>"However," A'wu's tone became more peaceful, "the third Miss is good after all.—"</p>
<p>Dagen released the teacup, stopped staring blankly, and gently blew on the white film on the water surface, causing it to form faster, crack faster, and dissipate faster.</p>
<p>"This year, in the first month, old man Yang came as a matchmaker for the Zhou family of Qiantang Bridge. When she found out, she scolded him away. She said she didn't care for wealthy families!…"</p>
<p>"Really?" He picked up the teacup, blew on it twice, and drank it down in one gulp. After finishing, he picked up the teapot, filled A'wu's cup, and filled his own.</p>
<p>"Who would lie about that?"</p>
<p>"That's a pity. I've seen the Zhou family too; they're truly wealthy. If she doesn't want such a family, she must want to marry a foreign top scholar with both talent and good looks."</p>
<p>"I think only a top scholar is worthy of her. Judging by her attitude, people like the eldest son-in-law and the second son-in-law are not in her eyes…"</p>
<p>The Huang family's affairs became the topic of conversation. A watermelon seed seller passed by. A'wu took out three copper coins and bought a pile, inviting Dagen to eat. Dagen awkwardly tried to learn how to eat. A'wu, however, was very good at it, without using his hands, he tossed a whole seed into his mouth and immediately spat out two pieces of shell. Dagen said with a sense of realization:</p>
<p>"Brother A'wu, I think you shouldn't live in the countryside; you should live in the city…"</p>
<p>"But now there isn't even a single person wearing a long gown in the city. What would I do there?…" (Twenty-six)</p>
<h3>A Record of the Dongbao Revue</h3>
<p>— Dule</p>
<p>This time, going to Nanjing, the only unexpected gain was seeing the grand performance of the Dongbao Revue of the Dahua Theater. Those who have been to Japan might not find it rare, but we have only ever heard people talk about the greatness of the Takarazuka Revue. Now, the Dongbao Revue of the Takarazuka Theater has actually come to China with great fanfare, and I, as part of their mission to celebrate the envoy, had the opportunity to "see it first" in Nanjing, which is truly delightful. At first, I thought that since the Dongbao Revue is a product of Japan, all the songs and dances would be rich in Japanese flavor, at most expressing the ancient beauty of Japan. I didn't have much hope for the performance aspect, but the result greatly surprised me: the Dongbao girls are not as short as we imagined; they are all very tall, with very healthy figures. Many American girls from the Wanhua Troupe we saw in Shanghai seven or eight years ago might not even compare to them. This is a miracle. Therefore, their songs and dances do not particularly emphasize Japanese style. Japanese-style songs and dances only make up ten programs, entirely included in the first part. The second part onwards all became</p>
<p>light and cheerful things, with twenty-four major programs, the rhythm is very lively, without pausing for a second, the audience in the audience seems to be "overwhelmed", intoxicated in this wonderful atmosphere. In addition to songs and dances, they also have short plays. In one short play, two people stand on stage, one imitating the movements of an orangutan, which is very realistic. He put on a mask and scared a woman away; then another woman came along, and he put on the mask again, but that woman stood still, seemingly not afraid at all. When he took off the mask, that woman looked at him and screamed instead, turning around and running away. This short play only lasted a little over a minute on stage, but the laughter of the audience was probably more than a minute!</p>
<p>I am very satisfied with the Dongbao Revue.</p>

<h3>The Paradise for Refugee Children: A Sketch of the Shanghai Fuyou Institute</h3>
<p>— Yao Shaosheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fuyou Institute is located in a corner of Dongjiadu in the south of the city. The institute is an old-fashioned house, and the architecture is quite exquisite. The upstairs is used as bedrooms, and the downstairs as classrooms. The "Fuyou City Government," library, recreation room, and offices for the children's extracurricular activities, as well as bathrooms, etc., are downstairs. The workshops are located upstairs and downstairs. The dining hall also serves as a classroom. The institute accommodates more than 200 refugee children, the youngest being six years old, and the oldest being over ten years old, divided into six grades. Both male and female teachers are rich in education. The management emphasizes absolute student self-government, hence the establishment of "Fuyou City," to cultivate the spirit of student self-government. Children of slightly older age, in addition to studying, learn various crafts according to their interests. The characteristics of the institute's management are: (1) simplification, (2) scientification, (3) productionization. Whether teachers or students, they all possess this spirit. Therefore, they can enjoy even miscellaneous grains such as broad bean flour, corn flour, and wheat grits. The teachers treat the children with kindness and affection, as if they were their own children.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Moral Education Society Appeals for Support from All Circles</h3>
<p>The Chinese Moral Education Society has been established for more than ten years, and has been engaged in good deeds such as providing porridge, clothing, materials, medical treatment, and medicine, as well as collecting infant corpses, providing small loans to the poor, and establishing charity schools, which have won the sympathy and support of all circles. Last winter, it expanded its porridge and clothing distribution to eleven branches in the local area and other places. This spring, it established an orphanage in Wuxi. Currently, more than a thousand poor people go to the society to receive porridge every day. The provision of materials, medical treatment, and medicine requires funds to maintain, so the expenses are huge. It appeals for support from all circles. Donations can be sent to the society at Lane 121, Tongfu Road, or call 37819, and a representative will be sent to collect them.</p>
<p>Seeking Talents with Modest Positions: The China Vocational Guidance Institute has recently been entrusted by various parties to recruit the following talents: (1) A Chinese bookkeeper for a machine factory in Hongkou, with rich experience, honesty, and diligence, provided with board and lodging, and a monthly salary of 400 yuan or more. (2) An accounting assistant for a hotel, with experience, good at calculation, provided with board and lodging, and a monthly salary of 200 yuan. (3) Two teahouse workers for a school, physically strong, hardworking, familiar with routes, slightly literate, and able to ride a bicycle, with a monthly salary to be discussed. All of the above require males, with substantial shop guarantees, around the age of thirty. Applicants can go to the institute on the third floor, No. 80 Hualong Road, every morning for an interview.</p>
