<h3 id="c1">保障國家的安定力量 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>「民爲邦木」，這是我國歷代政治家一切政治理論的中心，所以「爲政在得民」，我們對此也曾反復說過，以喚起當局的特別重視。但是進一步問，在全體人民中，那一階層才是我們國家的主要安定勢力呢？我們知道近代列强的重要安定勢力是金融資本，產業資本，和廣大的勞動者。我們呢，大家知道「以農立國」，最大多數的是農民。那麽，我們國家的安定勢力，自然應該是大多數農民，可是他們還沒有像列强之資本家與勞工那樣對于國家的命運起決定的作用。在我國，沒有近代的大資木家，缺少對國家具有決定力量的勞動者，農民數量雖多，但是無知識無組織，爲普遍的現象，因此也沒有重大的力量。所以中產階級，尤其是中產階級中的前進份子，具有左右社會政治風氣的力量。而且我國傳統的習慣，政敎不分，，一學而優則仕，仕而優則學」，是以當政者多爲知識階級，也就是社會中的中產階級或中層份子。這些人不僅只可以影響社會政治的風氣，而且在國民文化上居于最先進的領導地位。廣大的農民的動態是隨着他們走的。因爲我國的文盲極多，「草上之風必偃」的古訓，在實際上仍在發生作用。一般民衆的習慣，風氣，乃至嗜好，都隨着中產階級的習慣，風氣以及嗜好而轉移。所以中產階級在我國社會中，佔有領導的地位，我國社會，政治，文化能吾進步，都要看中產階級或中層份子爲轉移的。</p>
<p>我國社會的這種重要安定力量或領導階層，包括學校敎職員，中下級公務員，從事於正當工商業的人士，以及自由職業者如醫生，律師，技師，記者，文化人等等。但是，我們不能不承認事變以來五年有餘，受戰時經濟狀況損害最大的，也正是這一般人，無論任何方面的專家都不能不承認，現時物價的高漲，除了工農階層以外受害最大的，就是中產階級，尤共是智識份子，或文字勞工。智識份子的數量固然不多，一般領袖譏之爲「書生造反，三年不成」；但是實際上他在對中國社會，政浪，文化的重要地位旣如上述，那麼他們遭受莫大的損害，對于國家社會之影響，自可想見。在戰時大家應該苦耐勞，廢除奢侈習慣，然而我國中層份子，絕大多數已降低生活水準，至於影響到他們的全家的健康與精神，以及他個人的事業與工作效率。假如這僅有害於他們個人與家庭乃至於他們的兒童，那還不甚重要，在偉大的時代中，犧牲個人與其所有的一切以爲國家民族，那是應當的。但是目前問題的重心，在于歷來居於中國社會中堅地位，爲社會重要安定力量，並一向領導社會的整個中產階級，特別是知識份子，已有完全趨於沒落的可能。這在戰爭期中及戰後對于國家民族的損失與傷害，將達到何種程度，實在値得嚴重的注意。</p>
<p>物價高漲與生活困難，那是戰時不可避免的現象。但是戰時經濟的損害，如果只集中于全國人民中絕對少數的，知識程度較優，技術水準較高，以及國家民族思想較完全與芷確的中層份子，因而擾亂了整個社會的正常秩序，損害了國家最有力的中堅勢力，與重要的領導階層，那長應該呼籲全國迅速加以糾正的。爲了戰時政策的貫澈，更爲了戰後國家的建設，我們於呼籲改等公務員生活之後，更竭誠呼籲扶植國家之重要安定勢力的中產階級——中層份子，尤其是知識份子。</p>

<h3 id="c2">德義會談與中立國 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>德國外交部長里賓特羅甫，代表希特勒元首赴羅馬，與義國首相墨索里尼等前後會見共四次。關於東綫戰局，最近的突尼西亞戰局，前幾天義國內閣的大改組及外交陣營的刷新，以及兩同盟國間軍事，政治，經濟各方面的問題，二國的首腦者，聚首懇談所涉及的，想必很多。羅馬會談的結果，「確認穗義二國受日本及其他盟國之堅實的支持，在保障共同作戰的成功上意見完全一致。」</p>
<p>在達到最後勝利之前，德義二國在歐洲同心一德，傾其全力以戰的決意，我們毫無疑慮。對於敵國方面之惡意的離問宣傳，實有把此點反覆向內外闡明的必要。德義二國在軍事，經濟上的積極合作，有顯著的事實可　證明，敵國無論怎樣煽惑宣傳，終不能雕間德義間的聯繫。</p>
<p>歐洲除穗義二國之强固的團結外，必須要求法國，西班牙，及其他巴爾　諸國，在目前戰時中，戰事結束後，與軸心國家密切合作，羅馬會談「重申德意二國促進大歐洲圈內各國人民的活動，保障相互的雜益，用以保全歐洲各國人民的生存，建設歐洲新秩序的決意。」這與英美方面所侈談的大西洋憲章，有　壤之別，歐洲諸國開誠佈公，密切合作，則歐洲新秩序的實現，指日可待。現在諸中立國，若在戰後始在新秩序上合作，則將不能享受其權利，所以爲全體的將來福社計，各國應在戰時下盡其力之所能與德義合作。單是內心的同情，空口的援助，決不是參加知易行難，復興歐洲的大業，而欲分得一杯羹所應持的態度。對於此點，切望德義二國在政治外交上當應加緊活動。（翔：譯自三月四日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>德外長里賓特羅甫，在二月二十四日代表希特勒總統來到羅馬，先後四次會晤　索里尼首相，全面檢討歐洲的現狀，關於推進戰爭的共同措置，雙方意見一致，已經在二十八日啟程返德。</p>
<p>在會談席上，德國參謀次長，義國參謀總長也代表兩國的軍部列席參加。</p>
<p>里賓特維　氏這决訪問義國的目的，有政治，軍事，經濟三點，硏究兩國共同措置，檢討推進戰爭的新方策，關於其具體的內容雖然無法窺知，可是就現在的情勢推測起來，總不外乎以下幾點：</p>
<p>（一）對抗加　勃朗加會後的協約國的政治上示威。最近德軍在東戰塲的反攻和突尼西亞中部的新作戰，軸心國潛水艦的勝利，在客觀的情勢下，大家認爲使英美發生手足無措的慌張，協約國對歐開闢第二戰綫，在時間上已經失算，德義就趁此機會，協商辦法來消滅英美的包圍歐洲劃，檢討政治上，軍事上的一切辦法，同時爲了應付蘇冬季反攻後所造成的歐洲全局形勢起見，協議加强歐洲的反共主義陣綫。</p>
<p>（二）爲了促進法國木國的協力起見，故而探聽義大利的對法態度。</p>
<p>（三）借用義國的豐富人力資源，尤其是勞工，同時加强軸心和其與國的物資流通。</p>
<p>（四）共同研究應付以教廷為主體的英美謀略戰，俾在事前先定對策，又為要預防全歐赤化的危機，必須使教廷的人道主義和傳統反共主義與軸心軍作戰標榜的反共產，反猶太主義符合一致。</p>
<p>總之，這一次的會談，更加强了德義的一體聯合關係，對於決戰的形勢，必能更加鞏固，上面我們推測的第二項，聽說義大利方面提出的交換條件，相當厲害，關於這件事，里賓特羅甫外長，沒有決定的權力，必須希特勒總統和墨索里尼首相直接折衝，才能解決，所以外界預料希墨兩巨頭的會談，或許不久就要舉行。（雲鵬：譯自三月三日每日新聞羅馬專電）</p>

<h3 id="c21">日本重要產業槪況　（二） <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>經金屬工業戰事中具有決定性，所以應排除萬難，傾全力從事於增強飛機的生產。飛機工業的基礎資材是鋁與鎂，屬於輕金屬工業部門。目前日本輕金屬工業的規模與機構大概如次：</p>
<p>鋁的原料有二種，一種是滿洲華北埋藏量很豐富的　土頁岩，及朝鮮的明莽石，一種是馬來等南洋產的精鋁，第一種原料所含鋁的成份極少，不純物很多，比起精鉅來，在技術上，採算上都較爲遜色。該業的五大主要會社為昭和電工會社，住友鋁會社，日本鋁會社，日本輕金屬會社，及日本曹　會社，各社都以精鍋為原料而製造鋁。大東亞戰爭勃發前，因英荷二國凍結資產，致精鋁的輸入完全杜絕，於是乃採用國產原料簪代。大東亞戰爭的結果，品質·性狀，全世界第一的東印度·馬來的精鋁，完全歸入日本的掌握，鋁工業得到了這寶藏之後，宛如沙漠中發見了水源，在精鋁這原料上，確立了絕對不敗的基礎。</p>
<p>日本的鋁製造會社，除滿洲外，現在共有〇社，由帝國輕金屬統制會社任一元的配給統制之責。因大東亞戰爭的進展，鋁工業的重要性愈爲增加，於是產生了高度的一元統制的必要。結果，乃於去年九月一日，根據重要產業團體令設立了輕金屬統制會。該統制會的職員：</p>
<p>會長大屋敦氏（前住友鋁會長）。理事長小細嚴三郞氏（前帝國輕金屬會社常務）。理事兼總務部長　中大輔氏（前商工省燃料局部長）。企劃部長宮野春之進氏（前日滿鋁會針常務）。鋁至產部長安生　二氏（前日本鋁薈社董事）。鎂生產部長島田乙駒氏（前帝國輕金屬會社常務）。配給部長篠原照一氏（帝國輕金屬會社常務）。監理部長高山德氏（前日本輕金屬調度課長）。技術部長杉村盛一氏（前帝國輕金屬會社董事）。朝鮮支部長內野正夫氏（前商工省囑託）。福原豐三氏（帝國輕金屬會社董事）。野田淸氏（同）。</p>
<p>統制會的職員，由上述五家重要會社的代表者充任，並由帝國輕金屬會社作其經濟的後援。爲使與統制會一體化，故統制會長大屋氏除留任帝國輕金屬會長外，另由該社的董事三名兼任理事，以期由人的聯繫，而使生產部面與配給部面得有一元的統制。</p>
<p>會長大屋氏爲茨城縣出身，今年五十九歲，明法四十三年卒業於東大電氣工學科後。在遞信省曾任職數年。大止七年轉入住友本社，至昭和十五年四月任該社常務董事，十六年起歷任住友鋁製鍊會長，住友化學社長，帝國輕金屬會社長，去年九月就任統制會長，以迄今日。</p>
<p>氏在柬大　業時，會受特別獎賞，頭腦聰敏，用學究的態度澈底硏究事物的眞相，對事業非常努力，今已傾其全部精力於輕金屬的增產，深得該業中人的信賴。</p>
<p>鋁工業的統制，如上所述，根據重要產業團體會而設立統制會。對於重要的製造工塲，根據去年六月的工塲事業管理會，由商工省自打管理。商工大臣指抓監督各鋁的生產工塲主人，同時，於各該工塲，事業塲派有管理官，詳細調査研究勞務，資材，及動力等的營運狀况，與工塲長互相合作，使運營圓滑化。假使發見障碍的事項，立即由統制會，商工省會商解決。例如〇〇工塲，賴管理官的活躍努力而得以順利運轉，故該業人士對於管理官的配置大爲歡迎。在將來戰時經濟的進展上，因此而使管理制度有擴大的可能。</p>
<p>美國本年度飛機生產的目標爲月產一萬架，所以鋁工業的擴充，很爲努力。日本爲適應本年度的決戰姿態所取的增產對策，第一上述南方豐富的精鋁，雖能確保，但依目前的情况，因受船舶等運輸上的制約，故祗能採用在技術上，採算上，較爲不利的國產原料製鋁。</p>
<p>日滿製鉅會社，朝鮮理研金屬，日窒等業已用礬土頁岩製鋁，此次淺用化學硏究用天城山農的明礬石製鋁成功，國產原料可以大量採用，大可値得注目。</p>
<p>第二，是現存設備加以最大限度的利用。新創與擴充，需要時日與資村，在決戰階段無此餘裕。所以祗能把現有設備設法利用，使能盡其最大的效果。由產業設備營團供給空閑資材以爲修理補充之用，又鋁的電解設備能力，與鋁的製造能力的不均衡，如何加以改善，亦爲當務之急，而應急籌萬全的對策。</p>
<p>第三，爲技術的交流問題。製鋁工業必備有高級的程度，因技術的交流而使品質向上，極爲重要，故統制會網羅該業第一綫的技術者加入技術協力委員會共同愼重硏究。最初公認的優秀技術，而經各會社普遍採用的，是昭和電氣工業會社橫濱工塲的精鋁處理法之一種不焙燒法。用精鋁製鋁的時候，爲除去其化合水，普通都把精鋁加以焙燒。柔佛州，檳榔，婆羅門等南洋所產的精鋁，含化合水約有三〇％。鋁除用鎔焙的方法之外，很難熔解。現在不用焙燒的方法，結果，每年處理百萬噸鑛石的　候，可以節約石炭〇〇萬噸。此外，又可以節約焙燒用的資材，而鋁却可以增百分之二十乃至三十。所以這一方法實是一舉三得的優秀技術。</p>
<p>日本曹達會社亦已採用該法的一部。日本製鋁會社近亦進行種種準備，以便採用該法。假使其他工塲全部採用這方法，則鋁的增產可以獲得劃時期的效果。</p>
<p>最後，製鋁工業部門所應注意的傾向，爲各社進出朝鮮的計劃。製鋁工業需要大量的電力，故今後的擴充，必然將在朝鮮，滿洲各地。昭和電工，住友製鋁工會社經與關係當局疏通後，今正從事進出朝鮮計劃的準備。此與日本製鋁會社的進出台灣的計劃同爲國家百年大計中之第二次的生產力擴充。爲確立大東亞國防態勢的必要條件。</p>
<p>鎂的比重比鋁更輕，而且因其合金對於衝擊有强靱的性質，所以是飛機降陸的車輪上絕對必要的資村，且爲製造燒夷彈，照明彈，不可缺的原料，因戰事的進展，鎂也不能不有飛躍的增產。現在日本的鎂生產會社計有日本製鎂，日本鎂金屬，東洋金屬，大倉鑛業，旭電化，關東電化，東亞輕金屬，三菱製鎂，信越化學理硏金屬等十家。其製造原料爲製鹽時所產生的副產物苦汁，和朝鮮滿洲蘊藏甚多之鎂曹達鑛等。經營規模較小，製鎂技術世界各國都嚴守秘密，所以比製鋁工業約遲十年以上，生產原價亦不甚高。由上述統制會統制，調整其適當的販賣價格。爲適應增產的推進，把經營規模提高至適當的程度。最先實施的措置是把大倉產業的製鎂部門與柬亞輕金屬合併而設立帝國製鎂會社，目前該新會社正在準備設立中。今後製鎂工業的企業將一一加以調整。</p>
<p>上述新會社的製鎂法，把石灰石混入海水，作成水酸化鎂。再用水酸化鎂製成鎂，這是日本最原始的方法。縱令朝鮮，滿洲鎂曹達鑛的埋藏很爲豐富，然在現在因巡輸上不免有所制約，故採用易於獲得海水作原料，爲絕對有利的增產對策。統制會現正誘使內地的製鎂工業會社採用該法。在製鎂工業決戰態勢的準備上，這是値得注意的傾向。（翔：譯自三月一日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>— 地靈</p>
<p>（一）參戰以前的擴軍情況</p>
<p>美國正式整軍備戰，是在大東亞戰爭以前約一年半以上，還只一九四〇年初夏的事。即當一九四〇年五月，西歐方面，英法反軸心國的狼狽敗退，已成決定的事實，英帝國主義的慘敗，不僅使美帝國主義有「免死狐悲」之痛，而她在歐洲制覇的野心，以及美國對地中海和對西亞的活動，也不能不受到致命的打擊，在這種顧慮下面，援英的政策決定了，軍備擴張的計劃開展了。爲此，美國的財政，有了驚人的膨脹。一九四〇年-四一年度的軍事費，當初原預算爲十五億三千九百萬美元，實際支出爲六十四億六千三百萬美元，軍事費佔支出全額，從原預算之一八·二％，站至四八。九％，軍事費增大的原因，爲一九四〇-四一年度之支出，對一年度之一百二十七億增加三十八億美元。以上爲實支的數字，單單議會通過預算，從一九四〇年五月起至同年十月止半年間，僅軍事費即達當初預算的八倍，爲數一百二十六億九千九百萬美元。</p>
<p>一九四〇年夏，英國遭遇到德國的反封鎖，更加孤立化了，於是美國對英軍需品的輸出開始和增加了。一九四○年八月出現了對英輸出佔美國喩出總額之八五％的新紀錄。一九四〇年美國對英輸出一百十億美元，較戰前卽一九三八年增加到九三·七％。一九四〇年底，英國又失償付能力，因此，美國的後英開始僅貸與實物，而有　動世界的軍火租借法案之通過。軍火租借法案於一九四一年一月十日提出於議會，經過二個月的商討辯論，終於三月十一日經大總統簽名成立。根據這一立法而成立的預算，一九四一年三月底爲七十億美元，同年十月底爲五十九億八千五百萬美元，一九四二年二月中旬爲五十四億二千五百萬美元，合計共達一百八十四億一千萬美元，而依此預算，實際運往英國的軍需品，自一九四一年三月至一九四二年八月一年半期閘，達六十四億八千九百美元。不過，這個數字只是實際由美國輸往英國的車需品的數額，實際上美國依照軍火租借法案支出的數字還要比較得多，即自一九四一年三月至一九四二年二月一年間實際支出，爲輸英之額約二倍，達一百二十二億七千二百萬美元。如一九四二年六月十五日羅斯福總統所說，當爲貸與武器的生產，爲一年八十億美元，約合全部軍需生產的百分之十五。</p>
<p>（二）大東亞戰後的擴擴軍運動</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭爆發後，夏威夷珍珠港等美國在太平洋的軍略根據地迭受破壞，美國就更進一步積極的擴張軍備。</p>
<p>在大東亞戰爭爆發之後不久，一九四二年一月美國議會中，羅斯福提出咨文。從軍需生產的實際支出來看，一月爲二十一億元，二月爲二十九億元，四月爲三十四億元，五月爲四十四億元，是現急劇的上昇，其後半期支出之增加。則可視一九四一－四二年度（一九四一年七月至一九四二年六月）配出數爲三百二十四億美元這個數字而知。</p>
<p>一九四二－四三年度預算，在一九四二年年初，總統送交議會的預算諮文中估計爲五百八十九億美元，而據一九四二年十月十六日羅斯福總統送交議會的長文報吿書，預算包含七百四十億元的軍事費而超過八百億美元。又在一九四二年十二月十六日閉慕的一九四二年中之第七十七次議會中，通過了二千億美元的新預算。當然，這裏不只是一九四二－四三年度的追加預算，還包含着一九四一－四二年度的追加預算，及依據軍火租借法案的預算在內。由此也可以看到通過於美議會的預算之驚人的膨限。</p>
<p>在本會計年度（一九四二年七月以來），美國的實際支出數字有了高速度的增加，例如在一九四二年九月實支即達五十三億八千四百萬美元，軍臺費的支出，在一九四〇年六月爲一億五千萬美元，幾乎不及現在一日的支出，即九月份的支出，又較上年增加到百分之四百。</p>
<p>這樣拼命擴張軍備的結果，據一九四二年九月二十一日美國軍、需局長官德拿爾，納爾遜說，一九四二年，首七個月間的軍事支出相當於美國國民所得之三六％，回顧一九四一年的軍事支出只佔國民所得的一四％，一九四〇平只佔四％，而一九三九更佔二％，由此可見軍火生產增加之大　又據納爾遜那天的演說，上述期間，美國的軍需生產，均佔同一期間美國全部生產的四〇％，而在一九四一二年，則更將達到六〇%。</p>
<p>而羅斯顯總統更於一九四三年歲首的美國第七十八屆議會，提出一九四三-四四年度預算，據傳爲總額達一千零三十億的空前未見的龐大預算案，其中軍事費達九百六十億美元，較之一九四二-四三年度原預算中軍事費之五百三十億元，一舉而又增加達七〇％，這樣鉅大的軍事費，每月約佔八十億元以上，如果再加上追加預算，則以後每月的軍事實，就要超過百億元的大關。</p>
<p>（三）美國一九四三年的目標</p>
<p>如此擴張軍備的行爲，其目標是什麽呢？大東亞戰爭第一年，美國提出了「毋忘珍珠港」的口號，第二年的標語爲「由守勢轉到攻勢！」在大東亞戰爭第一年被迫自太平洋退軍的美國，自十一月中旬以來，以侵入法屬北菲來鼓舞國民的士氣，偉大宜傳「第二軍是反攻軍！」那麽，美國今後的戰略攻勢的眞意是什麽呢？</p>
<p>美國自從這一次世界大戰爆發以來，在一九四〇年夏，即爲防衛英國而以五十隻驅逐艦售於英國，同時，作爲交換條件，獲得將英領西印度羣島化作美國海空軍根據地的權利。而在這件事的前後，同年八月，加拿大又成立了美加共同防衛委員會，美國對加拿大這廣裘的領土的支配權擴大了，事實上美國的外交政策，已經利用了這次大戰而對西半球加强其支配力了。今日美國人已經視加拿大爲合衆國四十八州之後新成立的、第四十九州」了。而且，那時美國還立在中立圈內，它就開始自中美和南美伸展其控制力，排除拉丁美洲的英，德，義各國的權利，扶植美國的權利，並頣使中南美洲諸國，停止對軸心國的貿易，到了大東亞戰爭以後幾乎所有中南美洲諸國都已先後參戰，到了一九四二年八月，秘魯，和一九四三年一月，智利零國，也都宣戰了。</p>
<p>一九四二年五月，美國在西印度諸島中侵犯法屬馬丁尼克島，從此更向東方伸展其勢力，進而達到菲洲的西海岸。自一九四二年七月以來，美軍雖先後在法領赤道非洲，比領剛果，英領尼及利亞，富里太溫等繼續活動，到了十月裏，更進駐利比里亞共和國，威脅全部法領非洲殖民地，而到了十一月七日，美軍更狂暴地　入法領北非殖民地。對菲洲，歐洲以至對近東中亞各地實行軍事侵略的野心是開始暴露於天下了！對東亞，一方面固然已被日本逐出太平洋各重要的基地，然而英國近來放棄其反攻的野心，而對重慶和蘇聯的「援助」自然也是美國企圖恢復其對東亞制覇野心的另一種表現。</p>
<p>紐約太晤士報的軍事記者曾經說，現在英國軍隊駐屯了全世界五十個以上的軍略要點。這決不是不値得注目的一句空話。</p>
<p>英帝國在解體過程中，一切舊英帝國廉下的屬領，在先後歸附至美國麾下的過程中，而法國所有殖民地，也漸需美軍所蠢食。</p>

<h3 id="c51">太湖東南地區　清鄉工作的成績 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>肅靖治安的象徵</p>
<p>太湖東南地區第二期淸鄉工作地點，是松江南部，金山，平湖，嘉興，嘉善，海鹽，海寗一帶。這些地方，都在今年一月裏，劃作新行政區。這七縣的面積，在西約八十公里，南北約三十公里，總平均約有二千五百平方公里。，這一帶都是農業地區，主要的出產是米和小麥，雜糧等等，所以人家把這七縣認爲和湖州方面一樣是浙江省的穀倉。</p>
<p>這一帶櫛比滬杭綫，水陸交通都很發達，但是過去在治安上不甚太平，行政力量也不容易貫澈在這一方，蓋因太接近上海的緣故，所以上海的那種不艮影響，流到了這些地方，這些地方是偷運重要物資到上海的路綫，所以人家認爲這般偷運物資的人，阻碍了治安的改進。</p>
<p>大概偷述貨物的系統如下，餘姚等地出產的鹽，取道乍浦，金山衛等地偷運進來，無錫，常州方面出產的麵粉，雜糧，取道松江偷運出去，嘉興，嘉善的米，取道平湖，閔行等處的路綫偷運，縱横行駛在水上的船舶，也是偷運物資的有效工具。同樣的事實，從上海也能够把物資偷運到內地，上海的物資，大都是運到松江等地，有的用船，有的用人力，就是用所謂蜜蜂式的輸送方法偷運出口，松江，嘉興等處，是收發地點，到了這裏再轉到內地去。幹這種偷運勾常的人，大部份是依賴偷運物資爲生的地痞，流氓。還有一部份也是靠此營生的勞工階級，種極的不合理事實，使這一帶的治安趨於惡化，阻碍了行政力不能貫澈。</p>
<p>太湖東南地區第二期淸鄉工作，着手在去年十月，實施以還，在當局積極進行下，同時又得到民衆的協力，治安騾然改進，現在該處一帶，已能自由安全進出，從事偷運工作的流氓，也被驅逐出境，失粱後幹　偷運工作的勞工，都要恢復正業，滬杭綫上蟻接不斷的偷運物資的人們，也不再看見了。</p>
<p>現在鄕村和都市的人口來往，已經增加不少，這就是治安已吿平靖的明證。鄉下人心目中的都市嘉興，硤石，每天擠滿着四鄉的鄉人，無論茶館，菜館，戲院總是客滿，繁榮的情形，不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>經濟的復興</p>
<p>在淸鄉以前，因爲有偷運等事，能够收入一部非法利益。所以在經濟上有不少貢獻。自從淸鄉以後，經濟實行封鎖，物資都受管理，這種不法利益，已被澈底消滅。逐步建設合法正當的經濟，這一帶地方是大家知道的庶富之區，就地的出產來給養常地人民，是富足有餘的，下面是這一帶地方的食米出產和消耗的比較表：</p>
<p>縣名　產米量　食米消耗量</p>
<p>（單位一千石）　（單位一千石）</p>
<p>嘉与嘉善　六四五　四七二</p>
<p>平湖　二三八　二六四</p>
<p>海寗　六〇　七二</p>
<p>海盬　七〇　七一</p>
<p>金山　六四三　四二五</p>
<p>共計　一、六五六　一、三〇四</p>
<p>以上的統計，是根據各縣在淸鄕以前的報告，現在或許有不準確的地方，亦未可知。但是觀了上面的數字，當然有相當的剩餘。其他主要產物，約計小麥四十萬石，蠶豆二十萬石，大豆十一萬三石，菜子一萬五千担，蘭子二萬担，西瓜六萬担，以及其他種種，沿海還有食鹽，魚鮮等類不少。燃料（柴）也很豐富。</p>
<p>這裏淸鄉區的治安平靜，民衆得能安居樂業，才有了增產的現象，多耕一畝，多收一斗是任何農民所希望的，現在淸鄕工作當局，努力指導生產，設法搜集肥料，所以今後的增產是値得刮目相看的。</p>
<p>在太湖東南淸鄕地區內，農業上比較有進步的，就是松江及嘉興，嘉善，使用的肥料代價，每一畝是一百六十元，所收的米約二石到二石五斗左右。</p>
<p>收買，配給機構，漸决準備就緒，成績大概不差。米穀收買組合的指定商號和各地米業公會的關係，相當密切，最近又組織了食油，雜糧中日收買統制食等，有組織的收買工作，又因此而普及到了食油，雜糧方面。至於配給物資，由日華商業組合分發給另售商，但一般人認爲對於中國人方面的分配數量，尙有增多的必要。</p>
<p>地方財政的確立</p>
<p>這些地方，從前在財政上，不甚富裕，地方稅的大宗當然是田賦，可是祗有嘉善一縣有這種田賦宗卷，土捐宗卷，當然也不完備，簡直摸不着徵收田賦的頭緒，在這種情形之下，微收田賦那裏會有艮好的成績呢？納稅人但求少繳，收稅稅吏獨望中飽私囊，然而省縣方面竟也沒有辦法可以澈底査明這個稅收不振的原因。</p>
<p>跟着淸鄉工作的進展，一切土地關係，耕作係等，自然會明瞭了，田賦的稅收，漸漸地有了起色，去年度全部的徵收額超過了二千二百萬元，從前的田賦收入有多少，雖不明瞭，可是推測起來，想必還不滿現在的十分之一，這個二千二百萬元，完全是淸鄉工作所賜的，即此一端，可見得淸鄕工作是何等的重要。</p>
<p>第二期淸鄉區所採用的稅率，和江蘇省一樣，每一畝最高二十元，但是看田畝的等則，也有差額，如果能够照這個稅率實收的話，預料這一帶可以收入四千五百萬元。據淸鄉當局的表示，第一年度和江蘇省採取同一稅率，但是等到某一個程度，準備减低稅額。</p>
<p>太湖東南地區，從前在政治上，財政上都可謂係荒蕪之區，可是消鄕工作着手以還，有了顯著的成績，這就是事實吿訴我們，假使有其他荒蕪地區，而政治力不能深入民間，財政空虛的地方，也祗要實施淸鄕工作。自會轉好而變成沃肥之區，稅收可觀的地方了。</p>
<p>土地陳報和測量</p>
<p>上面已經說過這幾縣裏，沒有土地宗卷，沒有賦稅宗卷，這樣說起來，難道擱置不理囑，道是不行的，現在淸鄉當局已經下令各縣，尅日派員測量，陳報土地狀况，測量班分開數班，每一班有日籍技術人員協力丈量，測量工作最有進步的，就是嘉興·平湖方面，最近專門集中力量於嘉興，測量市街土地，陳報的面積和測量的結果，沒有多大相差，平均不過相差百分之五左右。</p>
<p>今後問題</p>
<p>丈量土地之後，將來對於租田關係，一定也有良好影響，這一帶還有一種特別現象，就是轉輾租借田地的傾向比較少，據淸鄕當局的調査，這一帶的農民，大部份是租田或半租田性質，嘉興·嘉善·金山等區的比率如下：</p>
<p>嘉興，嘉善兩區，平均有百分之八十一的農佃是替業主耕作的，金山區更甚於兩嘉，租田占百分之八十，自由兼租田占百分之十五，自田不過百分之五，我們看了這個數字，雖然不作一言，可是在腦海裏浮起了一種感覺，覺得必須要考應建設農業的問題。</p>
<p>淸鄕工作在今後階段的重要工作，就是要推進測量土地，整頓稅制，普遍組織合作社等問題，積極增量，和確立中國參戰後的經濟，有着莫大關係，每一個人都　首企盼積極生產。</p>
<p>就這裏的農產狀況來觀察，收成的數量和土地面積來比較起來，還不能達到理想，即就是肥沃之土的嘉興·嘉善·每一畝的收成也不多。</p>
<p>全部耕地之中，有多少水田，多少旱田，並不明白，不過產米的數額和耕地的面積來比較，產米不能算豐富，雜糧和其他農產物，也比較稀少，這是爲了什麽原故呢，上面的統計，雖不能完全置信它是確實不錯，可是這個生產不足的原因，當局宜乎愼　的考慮一下。（雲鵬：譯自三月八日大陸新報）</p>

<p>— 盧英</p>
<p>保甲爲現行之良好制度、關係地方治安至鉅、其糾織之週密健全與吾、不獨與市民有切膚痛癢之關、抑與整個社會之進化相聯繫、本局奉令接管南市保甲、迄今已有一年之歷史、在此過去一年中、警察與保甲能獲得澈底之合作、轉使南市治安力量益形充實、爰將過去一年來南市保甲之設施、分錄於後、用資檢討過去、策勵來茲、使南市之警保合作、更臻緊密也、</p>
<p>南市保甲　肇始時期</p>
<p>事變以來、南市慘遭兵燹、地方治安紊亂、達於極點、本人出長滬市警政、首先安定地方、使治安早日恢復、人民得以安居樂業、常時保甲制度、猶未推行、治安之維護、端賴警察、至民國二十八年八月間、南市政務署始奉市府命令舉辦保甲、南市保甲制度之肇始於此、當時全區劃分爲五坊、各設坊公所、每坊置坊長一人、惜限於經費、保甲制虔未能澈底完成、僅粗具規模而已、</p>
<p>警保合作　防止反動</p>
<p>至去年一月間、南市區公署奉令裁撤、全區保甲之管理工作遂由本局奉令接管、同時復委派前南市區公署保甲股中任詹希禹爲本局保甲管理員、俾資駕輕就熟、庶幾强化保中、得以事半功倍、而各坊坊畏、亦以熟諳保甲情形、未予更迭、本人以南市地方重要、乃於上年一月間、倡導警保合作、藉以消弭反動份子之蠢動、應密切聯繫、遇事無分彼此、以共同維護全區地方之安全、</p>
<p>複查戶口　辦理切結</p>
<p>査南市昆連租界、地處重要、而每月戶口異動頻繁、自易潛伏宵小、危害地方、本局於接管南市保甲後、首先飭令複査全區戶口、爲强化全區保甲之基本必要措施、複查全區戶口之工作完竣後、卽行辦理保甲規約、實施連保切結、惟當時因囿於民智、推行是項工作確有相當困難、經本局保甲管理員切實指導、歷時三個月、始克吿成、</p>
<p>重行改選　全區甲長</p>
<p>南市全區、於實施連保切結後、同時爲進一步强化南市保甲計、以全區五幼境內所設置之保甲長、良莠不齊、奉公守法者固多、而一部份乘機脅詐、魚肉民衆、恐亦難免、轉使失去推行保甲、維護地方治安之木旨、乃於同年七月間、決將全區保甲長重行改選、即行分令各坊公所、認眞切實辦理、爲期一月、全區保甲長、如數改選竣事、至此南市保甲制度、始逐漸納人正軌、</p>
<p>防杜流弊　須發證章</p>
<p>南市全區保甲制度、雖已漸臻週密、但爲遵照條例規定起見、復設立各坊聯保辦公處、計全區共五十二區、每處聯保長一人、專任保長一人、書記一人、同時爲便利服務訂、特頒發各保甲畏證章及服務證曁袖章等、以資識別、而杜流弊、惟全區保甲經費無着、各坊公所經常費用、尤極艱窘、益以聯保長辦公處成立後、開支益臻浩大、爰經呈奉市府核准、自本年一月份起、合併征收保甲經費、規定住戶每月一元、商店每月二元、從此保甲經費規定後、而保甲工作之推進、當可益臻順利也、</p>
<p>籌設警團　鞏固地方</p>
<p>南市區自警團之設立、旨在協助警察、加强地方治安、戢止匪徒蠢動、防患於未然、除令委南市三警察分局長爲該團分團長外、各坊坊畏爲隊長、並指委邑廟警察分局長王德林兼任該團總團長俾資統一、溯自去年一月成立迄今、全區恐怖不安事件、從未發生、地方治安、得以鞏固、此不能不歸功於警保之切實合作也、</p>

<p>由於保甲制度之確立、本埠辦理各項地方事業之機關、均擬借重此種組織、以與居民共同協力推進公共事務、</p>
<p>隨時督導　注意衛生</p>
<p>據探悉、兩租界衛生處、刻已積極籌備利用保甲制度、使公共衛生事業、有良好之發展、其辦法大致將令各保甲首腦、管理其所屬區域內淸潔工作、在平時須隨時督察居民注意衛生、在必要時、則由衛生當局、特別發起宣傳運動、飭令各保甲長轉知各戶、對於所指定之衛生工作、協力進行、</p>
<p>自警協助　管制交通</p>
<p>對於公共交通規則之維持、在本月十二日、由保中靑年部舉辦安全運動之後、嗣後各守崗之自警員、亦將由當局飭令若輩協助巡捕負責監督行人或車輛遵守交通規則之職務、惟自警員之管制交通、其辦法以「勸誘」爲主、務使居民樂於遵行、</p>
<p>共同監督　防免火災</p>
<p>上海救火會、自力圖革新以來、訓練救火員以及購置新式救火器具等、均已積極辦理、惟悉火政處當局、於最近亦有利用保甲組織、以防止發生火警之計劃、此項計劃、大概在使各戶居民、由保甲長領導、作各種防免火災之準備、並互相監督、勿使有易於火燒之機會產生、同時在緊急時、並將令各戶共同幫助滅火云、</p>

<p>— 青蓮</p>
<p>（四）民族解放運動</p>
<p>緬甸人民的民族獨立運動，自從英國建立在緬的殖民地政權以後，始終沒有停止過。而且是向愈演愈烈的過程中。</p>
<p>一九二〇年開始的印度民族解放運動領袖「聖雄」甘地倡導的對英不合作運動，燃燒起全印度反抗英帝國主義的民族怒潮，國民會議派在印度取得了民族運動的領導權，這繼續了兩年的第一次印度民族運動，給予緬甸人民以强烈的反帝意識的刺激，也推動了緬甸的民族獨立運動。</p>
<p>一九三二年，隨着國際帝國主義的經濟恐慌之後，緬甸人的民族獨立運動者提出了脫離英國覊絆爭取政治獨立的口號，獨立運動的潮流泛濫了全緬甸。英國人對他們也像對付印度民族解放運動一樣，採取了慘無人道的高壓手段，然而由於緬甸民族運動者出人意表的犧牲精神，絕不屈服的堅持鬥爭，把老奸巨猾的英帝國主義者怔住了！他們不得不慌忙改變顏色，設立所謂西門委員會，進行印度和緬甸的政情調査。但是，這並無絲毫放棄特權的誠意，只是一種遮眼術，企圖暫時緩和緬甸人的反抗，有時間作進一步的鎮壓。緬甸人當然不會看不到此就在「委員會中無印緬人民代表」的理由之下，對該委員會進行「杯葛」。於是，英國統治者不得不作「更大的」讓步，西門案就成爲倫敦圓桌會議的中心，決定印度與緬甸分治。——雖然，實際上這又是一種新的欺騙的開始。</p>
<p>原來英國將印度作爲本國的商品市塲，已達到了飽和點，印度的民族解放運動也已發展到成爲英國致命的痛苦的階段，爲了保持這個「大英帝國之皇冠」首先在設法擊破印度民族的團結力量其中之一就是實行印緬分治，對緬甸方面，表面上似乎是「讓步」了，有了「自治」的前途了，這樣，對印度民族運動，是分裂去一部份的力量，而且英國更利用過去印度人在緬甸密佈高利貸剝削所引起的緬人對印人的仇恨，而使「自治」的緬甸成爲牽制印度民族運動的一支別働隊。英國分化相鎭壓殖民地反帝運動的手段是如何巧妙和惡毒啊！</p>
<p>從印度分裂出來的緬甸，成爲英帝國的直轄殖民地，首先創設兩院議會制。議會中分上下兩院，上院爲由總督任命的議員所組成，結果便成爲英國在緬權利的保護機關。下院則由緬甸人民中自行公選的議員組成，但在緬的印度人和英國人也有選舉和被選舉權。內閣由十個大臣組成，但其行政權不及於總督和國防部統轄下的部撣（Shau）聯邦州和西北部酋長統治下的地域，而且內閣對於國防費之支出也沒有發　樣。換一句話，國防預算由國防部決定，不經過議會及內閣大臣的裁議，而總督又對議會的決議案　否狀權，所以緬甸雖有議會政治的名義，實際上英國政府還保持着廣大的權限，緬甸人民絕無眞正的政治上的自治權。</p>
<p>這種虛偽的政策，自　激發了全緬人民對憲法的不滿和助長了緬甸的民族獨立運動。新時代之光，早已照耀到佛國的全域，民族解放鬥爭的怒火，已在伊洛瓦底江兩岸和三面叢山中燃燒起來了。</p>
<p>（五）英國的榨取</p>
<p>英國實際地統治緬甸，始於第二次英緬戰爭後的一八六二年（淸同治元年），英國派任政務長官，統治下緬甸。這個統治，直繼續到完全併吞以後的一八九七年（光緒二十三年），到了一九二三年（民國十二年）才正式併爲英　印度的一省，直轄於印度總督的統治之下。</p>
<p>緬甸被併後最顯著的事情是印度人移緬的增加，英帝國主義利用印度人爲商業代理人，軍人和警察，即「以印制緬」的政策，控制全緬的國民生活。但同時，印度人都漸得在緬甸與英人頡頏而掌握緬甸商業的牛耳，到了蘇彝士運河開通之後，緬甸漸成爲國際性市塲，促進了緬甸土地的開發，更使緬甸經濟出現了根本的變革。首先是將緬甸所產的米穀等各種資源，列爲國際商品，利用善於經營的印度商人，增加英資本主義的貿易利潤，在這裏緬甸的產米地區，便也由上緬甸，而移到下緬甸了，其次，跟着土地的開拓，印度移民像浪潮一般向東湧進，同時以馬德斯拉爲根據，所謂「揭貼」的印度人高利貸資本，也作爲土地金融而深入緬甸，絞吸了緬甸農民的膏血。</p>
<p>印度及印度人在緬甸的地位，漸漸成爲足以支配緬甸國民生活的重要因素，近二百萬的印度人中，三分之一爲勞工，三分之二都從事於貿易和一般商業，而官廳及交通機關也充滿着印度人。一千餘緬甸工廠勞工中，印度人占百分的七十五，尤其是仰光方面印度勞工占未熟練工人的百分之九十五。占熟練工人的百分之七十。緬甸工人，以石油工人爲主，與印度相較，其生活程度與素質都較低下。只有在上緬旬，還多少保存着緬甸的原有狀態，多數汽車運輸業，家庭工業，印刷業等，還由緬甸人在從事。近幾年來，由於滇緬公路的通車，華僑勢力又在上緬甸增加了。</p>
<p>對緬甸最大多數居民—百分之八十的農民實行苛酷的剝削的高利貸資本，到處遍佈其吸血的細胞網，幾無一寸土地或無一個緬人可以漏網。牠們在農忙時期對緬甸農民借款，以採取高額的利息，如果農民無力償還，就沒收其土地。由於沒收土地之刺激，在一九三〇年造成了米價暴跌的紀錄，據當時統計，「揭貼」對土地的融資額爲五億盧比以上，實占全緬融資額七億五千萬盧比的三分之二。於是，一九二八年爲七二·一％的下緬甸的自耕農土地，至一九三〇年减至五四·二％；上緬甸的自耕農土地，則自九〇％减至八六·三％，高利貸資本席捲去緬甸自耕農的土地，造成了緬甸農業的恐慌。</p>
<p>英國爲了避免獨立運動，於一九三七年允許緬甸實行自治，不再是印度的一省了。他利用政治上的欺騙和軍事上的優勢，鞏固其在緬甸的剝削和掠奪。</p>
<p>緬甸最重要資源的石油工業，始創於一八八六年（淸光緒十二年），爲與英國政府保持密切關係的緬甸石油公司（資金一千八百五十萬磅）所獨占，其　鉛，銀，亞鉛，錫等也爲以濃厚的英國勢力爲背景的緬甸商會所一手掌握，而森林的採伐，米糧的販賣等等，也由英國資本組成的史蒂爾布拉遮斯商行和同樣爲英國系的孟買緬甸商務公司所壟斷。碾米工業，也以英國經營的爲最大，雖然全緬六百四十家中只有四十五家，而其雇傭的勞工已達二萬人；緬人經營的三百家，所用工人不過一萬人，印度人及華僑經營的共爲一百五十家，工人各約五千人。所以，無論從那一角度看，英國資本穩然爲緬甸經濟的中樞，壟斷着碾米，鑛產，林產等的主要部門。而在緬的英人，又在緬甸政治，經濟和軍事上占有最重要的地位，不是大官和軍人，就是大商人大企業家。</p>
<p>據一九三七年英國外務次官白特拉在下院報吿，英國對緬投資額爲六千萬至七千萬磅，印度人爲七千萬盧比（合五百二十五萬英磅），可見英國對緬的投資，也佔有壓倒一切的多數，於是，我們可以說，在大東亞戰爭以前儘管政治上的地位已在開始動搖，但是英國在緬甸的經濟的優勢，還是根深蒂固的。</p>
<p>（六）華僑在緬甸</p>
<p>緬甸和中國發生關係至少有一千年了。從民族的分佈上看，從經濟結構生產方式來看，更從地理上的關係和文化上的關係來說，中國和緬甸的關係是非常親密。事實上，一部緬甸歷史，尤其是緬甸文化史，是和中國印度分不開的，特別是中國人民和緬甸土著民族，大體上說，就使在過去也是最親善相愛的民族，誰也沒有侵略的野心。僑緬的同胞中，以雲南，福建和兩廣的同胞爲最多，至要的職業是小買賣和手工業，農民也不少，而開鑛的勞工中，也有大部份是華僑，他們多數是從雲南來的。由於華僑絕對沒有政治上的野心，而且一向站在被壓迫民族反抗英帝國主義的立塲，同情和援助緬甸民族的獨立運動，所以在緬甸有着普遍的眞正的好感。</p>

<p>陳夫人詞</p>
<p>陳市長夫人在上海特別市婦女會致詞原文如下、「各位來賓、各位姊妹、今天我來參加這個國際婦女節、領到各位敎益、我萬分的高興和快慰、可是我於高興和快慰當中、生出數點感想、現在讓我說出來、給各位參考、如有不妥當的地方、還望各位指敎、</p>
<p>第一點、關於國際婦女節的歷史和國際婦女的地位、想今天到來參加這大會的同胞都明瞭、用不着我在這短短時間中來說、現在我要說的、是中國婦女知識和道德問題、我主張中國婦女的知識、要迎頭趕上、與日俱增、有了相當新的知識、才能擔當今日新中國劃時代的使命、但是道德方面、不能過於左傾、換言之、思想要新、道德要舊、是我生平抱負的見解、古人說得好、「其身不正雖令不從」、我受到這敎育思想頗深、所以我認爲道德的出發點、不外乎禮義廉恥四字、</p>
<p>第二點、我主張婦女擔任敎育事業和慈善工作、我感覺得婦女的生理心理和性情、都和男子們不同、這是天然的很難改進的、因爲不同、所以我們婦女的工作、不一定和男子一樣、例如現在擴展到大東亞戰爭、我們婦女是不是要和將士們到前方去才算愛國、才算盡了我們的責任、不是的、我以爲我們在後方協助將士們的工作、更爲重要、這個道理、我於婦人朝日新聞刋載「我的家庭生活」一文中、已經說過了、我還感覺婦女的本性、是偏於感情的、這是婦女的好處、假定她偏於理智而薄於感情、那就不能維持家庭撫育子女了、要而言之、婦女的生理·心理·和性情、都適宜於擔任敎育事業和慈善工作、尤其是家庭敎育的重責、非婦女擔當不可、沒有好的家庭敎育、專靠學校敎育是不能得到完滿的效果的、</p>
<p>第三點、我不主張婦女參政、我觀察到婦女天性是偏於感情、不重理智、而政治問題、是關乎國家大政、一興一革、與乎用人行政、着着影響於國家命脈、偶一不愼、喪權辱國了、古人說、「一言足以興邦、一言足以喪邦、」追溯古往今來、婦人參政的、能有幾人、古之視今、猶今之視昔、我們應知所進退了、更進一步來說、婦女的能力知識、未有充分以前、不宜參政、縱使有了相當的知識和能力、也應當拿出自己的本領來幹、如果只靠着背境、依附他人的力量去染指政治、爭爭口氣、這不獨危害國家社會、甚至足以身敗名裂、後悔無及、我很希望中國婦女、對於這點認識淸楚、不可輕舉妄動、</p>
<p>第四點、我贊成婦女提倡正當娛樂、首先潔身自愛、所謂貧賤不能淫、富貴不能移、威武不能屈、這叫做女丈失、時時刻刻、我們要加緊我們的本位工作、工作完畢、我們就要提倡正當娛樂、因爲正當娛樂、一方面固然自己身心愉快、他方面也可以感激朋友、影響到家庭、我相信人性是「性相近」的、進了好的環境、惡人漸變爲善、進了壞的環境、善人也漸變惡、這是「性相近習相遠」的道理、我希望各位注意、</p>
<p>我說得太長了、現在歸納來說、我希望各位婦女、拿出精神來、把本位的工作做好、那麼、劃時代的新中國、自然蒸蒸日上、我們也心安理得、不會把今日的婦女節虛度、我們彼此努力吧、昨日紀念情况殊稱熱烈、大會主席團並肅電汪主席曁陳璧君中委致敬、</p>

<p>— 孫貽讓</p>
<p>此次申報月刊徵文，以「今日之上海文化界」爲題，承讀者踴躍惠文。因月刊篇幅不多，未能盡取，茲摘選數篇移載本報。　—編者註</p>
<p>照「文化」一詞的原有的含義，說來，實在相當的廣泛和繁複——但這里只得縮小界限來說就是指的所謂「出版物」，也便是「著諸竹帛」的文學方面而已。</p>
<p>從表面上看，「文化」似乎是一個抽象的詞眼，但從實際上論，則文化的萌芽，發展，郤必須嚴密的和物質條件，配合着；尤其是政冶的經濟的得失，正是決定文化消長的重要因素。以此而推論上海有一時期的文化界，其所以蕭條荒凉的原因，大約也不外乎當時政治方面之尙未改善。倘用較爲簡雅的詞眼作譬喩，則作爲那時候的「文苑」，恰如前幾月的叢野：處處的呈現着飄零憔悴。</p>
<p>然而天時旣有轉機，人事亦當然一樣，而回溯一下上海文化界的「轉機」，似乎還是始於還都以後。跟着各種的設施，組織逐漸的上了軌道，在文化界，也多少顯出了復與的朕兆。於是而有蓬勃，於是而有熱烈，縱然未能盡如人意，但也不無差强人意，較諸過去的蕪雜，也更顯出了今日的磅礴</p>
<p>就「今日上海文化界」而論，正可套用一句成語來說：良莠不齊。換言之，就是中間也未嘗不有保持嚴謹的態度，優良的水準的出版物。筆者手頭凑巧有幾本近出的期刋，如萬象，古今，雜誌等。這里就以出版已有一年餘的「古今」來作一個具體的例子。</p>
<p>「古今」的社長是朱樸之氏。他在黨政界中雖先後擔任了許多要職，但他的興趣郤是傾向於文化事業。而「古今的崛起，亦正當當時文化界寂寥之秋，據它的發刊詞說，是「想在此出版界萬分沈寂之時，來做一點我們所自認尙能勉爲其難的工作」。這倒確是事實：並且由此而開了此復熱鬧的出版空氣，則也可說是一點値得表彰的勞績。不象前於此的「萬象」月刊等，能始終克服各種困難，束縛而一直支持到現在，並且還保持一個適當的水準，這種精神也使人覺得欽佩的。至於「古今」的取材之謹嚴，風格的獨特，在眼前作家零落，題材空虛的局面下，不能不說是極爲難得的了。尤其是幾篇名人的文章，都能於個人的生活，經歷和性格上作自我的批判，令人更覺親切有味—說到名人的文章，倘非出諸藝術手捥高超的，往往有一種缺陷：非流於應酬性的淺率，即失諸敎訓式的枯燥。但以「古今」所刋的而論，郤於字裏行間刻劃着作者的至性。至情！「即小以見其大」，使讀者像面對着他們的影子，而窺到了他們的胸樣，氣魄與才幹，讀罷而自然地起着欽慕，惕勵之感。較之刻意爲之的格言，敎條之類，其作用就不可同日而語了。至於其他的作品，雖不是篇篇可誦，但十之七八都還有一讀的價値。總之，不管因讀者的興趣，嗜好而對它的欣賞有程度上的距離，但對編者的工作態度之嚴肅，水準之高尙，郤是一致的感想。雖然也許有人要說它是　門搬弄古董，挾述舊事，但在此時此地而對有意義的史料，掌故，和値得敬佩的人物，加以鈎稽探索，發揚光大，該是另眼相看的事吧？此外，如屬於新中國報系的「雜誌」月刊，雖然有幾處稍覺得眞正的，「雜」，然在大體上，也還够得上「結實」二字。</p>
<p>這是今日上海文化界中較爲努力的一　。</p>
<p>但在另一方面，則頗有令人覺得骨鯁在喉，聊盡區區之言責的，即有一部分文化人的活動的目標，態度，我以爲必須加以糾正與反省。由於眼前的現實條件的限制，有許多事情之無能為力固是實情，但文化界的某一部人在主觀上不作嚴肅認眞的努力，也是無可否認的缺點——特別是紙商的如虎添翼之際，如果我們多辦一個無聊的刊物，多寫一篇無聊的文章，就不啻多增加國家一分不必要的消耗，無意義的浪費。何况文化人之於紙　，原是相依爲命的供具，更應有分外的愛惜與珍重。</p>
<p>但自然，這樣的說法，不免大有問題。因爲所謂無聊和「有聊」之間，它的界限又在那裏，而它的標凖又怎樣取舍？是不是除了「經國使野」的大品文之外，其餘的就全是不足道哉？</p>
<p>不錯，這兩者之間的區別，確使回覆者頗費躊躇。不過天下的是非說來雖曰不一，但我們如能取決於多數人的好惡，大約雖不中亦不遠的了。例子之一是；當一個刊物送到廣大的讀者之前時，至少有一特點是可以看得出來的，即主編者的認眞與馬虎，嚴肅與苟且。像有一部分的刋物——幸而還是少數的，我人閔一望而知其為「噱頭」透頂，生意眼十足，而一味的在迎合庸俗的讀者的趣味。</p>
<p>但自然，我們也決不大唱高調，要怎樣的「前進」，「正義」。在眼前而有毅力，金錢來辦「文化事業」，則出版者之不能不顧到「生意眼」，似乎已成爲大經地義的了。然而我又想，即使是這樣，我們總還得有點分寸，有個節制。我們在說起話來的時候，彷彿誰都會說一套什麼「文化」呀，「精神食糧」呀一　的美麗的　句，堂皇磊落，搖筆即來。因此，當我們一日眞的做了起來，也得多少的顧到「文化」的實效。即以「生意眼」而論，我們也多少要爲「主客」讀者的代價設想一下，從而讓他們帶一點眞正的食糧回去，使他們添一點良好的營養，不要僅僅在讀者惡濁的趣味上兜圈子。對於文化，尤其應該保持一點尊嚴與純潔。飲水思源，我們終究是一個文化人！</p>
<p>但在今天而作這種「不合時宜」的論調，也未有不笑爲「書生之見」的。例如有許多短視的人，看到政治上的若干貪汚跋扈的現象，商業上的投機操縱的風氣，無不環着得過且過，醉生夢死的心理，於是在文化界的有些蠕蠕而動的人，先覺到「眼紅」，還不够，接着便「技癢」起來。理由是：反正大家這樣，何妨混水摸魚！這樣，一切香噴噴，軟迷迷的色情文學，都在這種心理下泛了起來。但我們還得理性地想一想：國家，社會之於文化人，畢竟　望較大，而且也較爲優遇。因而我們的使命，任務，也不能和貪汚投機之輩相提並論。我們不必怨天尤人的責怪別人不加重視，只要嚴正的做起來，我們的精神上一定有崇高，尊責的收穫，而廣大的讀者必定站在嚴正的工作者這一面的！讓我們來聽一聽那些苦留巴黎的文化人的話：「他們的良知囑咐他們留在受了創傷的祖國。」在今日的上海的文化人，倘想真的替「受了創傷的祖國」出一些汗汁與墨汁，那末，就請脚踏在苦難的土地上做一點切實的事，至少限度，也別再製造文化的毒素。</p>
<p>其次，除了上述色情文學的乘機起哄以外，就是一些較純正的刊物，在質的方面，還顯得貧弱與不調和，而可以卓然　成爲獨特的風格的，除了前面說的「古今」等外，也感到絕少，否則，它的銷數便有限。所以在出版者和編輯者，就不得不採取五花八門的方針，展讀之下，眞可謂應有盡有，以至於無奇不有；優因大部分作家的星散，留在上海的便覺寥寥可數，而這「寥寥可數」，有的改行，有的擱筆，因此，當我們翻開一本新出的刊物時，愈感到單調，沈悶了。而這些作家之中，又因生活的不安定，村料的空虛，心境的徬徨，就雖得有傑出的作品。同時，在單行本方面，情形似乎更加悽凉。像過去的以「日出一書」相號召的商務印書館，這一年多來簡直沒有出過半本！以這樣一個代表中國最大的文化機關，却過着這種冷板凳生活，總不能不說是一個大遺憾，至於自劊以下的其他出版機關，自更不必贅說了。這說起來固然是經緯萬端，但最大的原因，却還是紙價的汹汹撲人，晋書記左思成三都賦，而有「洛陽紙貴」之語，這在那時是一句頌贊，但在目前却是一個尖刻的諷刺了！這一點，我們竭誠的希望有關當局能够早定大計，應該像對其他的日用品一般，加以合理的統制。然後再進一步的，對少數的無聊，庸俗的刋物，報紙，不管是淘汰也好，合併也好，總之必須有調節的辦法，均匀的分配，這樣，才可「損有餘以補不足」</p>
<p>最後，對於一些眞正埋頭苦幹，而又淸苦侘傺的文化人，也應有一種補助和酬答。所謂「賣文爲生」的文人，在今天雖非賣文爲死，但以素來荏弱的身體，　應付這樣　壓的物價，却無疑的在接近「死」了！而且我們又如何能望其有「偉大作品」的出現？又如何能遏止其嘆窮與訴苦？像有一部分的文人的改弦易轍，就是鑒於筆耕所人不足以養八口之家的緣故，但爲整個的文化着想，又是何等嚴重的損失。</p>
<p>「爲政不在多言，顧力行如何耳」？當此風雨如晦之際，無論是秉國政的，或執筆政的，得緊記這兩句話。然後互相督促，提絜，來作曙色依稀中的鷄聲，啼破寥寂的文苑，進而啼醒東方的一角！</p>

<p>三月五日最高國防會議舉行會議時，通過實業部部長梅思平氏所提政府實施絲制主要物資及管理平定物價案，此一提案，包含一個重要法令，存乎其中，即工商團體應爲純粹經濟機構，不得參加政治運動。初觀此點，或以爲此項提案，等於枝節，實則任何一個政府，爲維持公衆利益計，絕不當假借政治勢力以爲商業之經營。以吾人所知，國民政府原有法定條文，禁止官吏參加商業活動，亦即此意。</p>
<p>根據國家法令，政府人員或社會人士，不做官吏，便做商人，不當同時以一身而兼爲官吏與商人，緣在任何情形之下，無論平時，或戰時，一人同時活動於官商二者，必不能爲公衆最高之利益着　，其結果必至政治腐敗，而與政府維護人民公衆利益之目標成爲逕庭。反之，社會人士，因其本身之地位關係，不宜令其參加政治活動，在世界各國，亦均有其規例。故梅部長之提案，實應爲全國公衆所擁護，以其不但成爲南京新經濟政策中之一個特點，抑且爲促進公衆利益的一個先決問題。</p>
<p>其次，梅部長之提案原文，認爲物資價格與物資供求，其間有密切關係，由是言之，是知製成品之價格有繫於物品原料之價格，故物資之供求關係最爲重大，而增强戰時經濟力量，實乃爲梅部長提案全文之中心點。（依人譯自三月八日泰晤十報）</p>

<h3 id="c71">再論强化同業公會 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>同業公會爲民間經濟之重要組織，自應予以力量，賦以全權，俾得行使其職權，協助政府實施戰時經濟政策。本月五日國防會議爲政府實施統制主要物資及管理平定物價起見，規定工商團體爲純粹經濟機構，以便專心一意協助政府奉行各種經濟方策，原案略謂安定民生，增强經濟力量，實爲戰時體制下政府施政首要急務，現在政府對於主要物資應予實施統制，以謀生產分配曁消費之調整與合理化。關於物資價格，與物資供求，其間有密切關係，亦應同時實施管理，以防止投機囤積，致價格不易抑平。所有各種工商團體，實爲施行物資統制及保持物價均衡之主體，故應規定爲純粹經濟機構，此後凡有政治性質之運動及訓練，擬請以保甲爲對象，不得再在工商團體範圍以內活動，期使工商團體組繳之健全，庶有利於物資統制及平定物價政策之推行。</p>
<p>此種規定，非但可以一矯已往工商團體惟知酬應官塲徵逐於開會演說之缺點，抑且足以加强工商團體本身崗位以內之基本工作。工商團體之基層組織，厥爲同業公會，而以商會總其成。昔日之同業公會，往往徒擁虛名毫無實際，早已等於告朔之餼羊。以此種無力量無權能之同業公會，欲其應付極重要之戰時經濟政策，其絕無效力固已彰彰明甚。今則賦以全權，加重其力量，使之專心於物資之生產分配，以及消費之調整，而不涉政治運動，當能以全力從事於物資價格與物資供求之合理化，藉明個人之立塲，以副政府之期望。</p>
<p>惟欲其發生力量，應强迫廠號全體加入同業公會，使其有絕對服從之義務，使其對於同業公會之權力，絕對不可反抗。今後同業間之進貨，出貨購料製造，以及種種設施，只有在一個統御之下，絕對遵守。關於物資價格，一經規定以後，絕劉不得違背，私自增减。會中可以採用切結連坐之法，以若干家爲一組，一組之中，互相聯保，時加密査，如發現違背者，立即予以嚴厲之處罰。如是，同業公會之責任旣重，工作更繁，當然無暇於本身業務以外之活動矣。即以華商股票同業而言，如果早經組織同業公會，予同業以範疇，作軌道以內之現貨交易，以正常業務爲原則，在軌範以內買賣，何至每生枝節，時多問題，以致同業常在恐慌飄忽之中，度其歲月，可見加强同業公會，不僅可以協助政府奉行經濟策略，即爲同業自身計，亦足策業務之安全，謀交易之穩定，於公於私，實爲兩利之道。</p>
<h3 id="c72">華股同業　昨舉行臨時集會　選定十五人為同業臨時代表團　擬向各有關當局商討復業問題 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>華股市塲自停止交易以來，因當局對經營華股各行號，業已規定登記辦法，今後凡依法登記獲准，亦領有執服之華股行號，經營股票交易，即可認爲合法，故目前各股票公司，均在辦理手續，準備復業。惟在正式復業之前，若干公司鑒于該業尙無同業公會之組織，於業務之推進上，殊多阻碍，故由永昌，興業，樂茂等二十九家股票公司聯名邀集全市同業，於昨日下午二時假座四馬路杏花樓集議。商討組織同業公會辦法，同時並以華股市塲之復業問題，爲討論中心。茲將昨日下午會議情形探悉如下：</p>
<p>與會代表</p>
<p>査本市經營華股買賣之行號，所謂股票公司，據估計恐不下一二百家，惟以缺乏組織之故，同業間向甚散漫。去歲八，九月間雖一度有將籌組同業公會之訊，但不久終吿流產，殊屬可惜。此屆同業集會，到會代表，計有良濟，永昌，興業，等共達一百三十一家，其規模之大，可謂該業有史以來之創見。當日工部局特高課並特派錢順堂君蒞塲監視。</p>
<p>籌備經過</p>
<p>此次會議最先發動者，係業中少數熱心份子，如興業股票公司兪明時，國泰股票公司張益林，華商股票公司周倫棣等。事前據聞已曾一度召集雛形的非正式會議，當塲議決由當日與會之興業樂茂等二十九家股票公司聯合具名，發起邀集全體同業舉行臨時集議，同時通知主管當局派員蒞會。</p>
<p>集會動機</p>
<p>會中公推兪明時爲臨時主席。繼由張益林，周倫棣分述此次籌備邀集全體同業會議之宗旨及其經過·張，周二君力言華股事業在整個商業與金融上所佔地位之重要，繼又坦白承認『過去同業經營華股買賣，於手續上容有錯誤，至少在主管當局目中已認爲必有錯誤』因此，爲謀打破目下嚴重而沉悶之僵局，爲圖籲請各有關當局迅予經營華股合法途徑之指示，遂形成昨日首次集會之動機。</p>
<p>論題一斑</p>
<p>會議討論之中心，幾完全集中於推派代表團以求解決復業問題之一點。雖亦曾有人主張立即產生一永久性類似同業公會之組織，然大多數意見，似尤注重於澄淸目前僵局之問題。故最後唯一之決定，僅爲推選同業代表十五人，搆成一「華商股票同業臨時代表團」，由大會授權，分向各有關機關接洽，庶如何可獲恢復正常營業，方能切符政府當局統制物價等等法令之意旨。</p>
<p>當選代表</p>
<p>繼推選代表團，當選者十五人，名單如下：張孝賢周倫棣，兪明時，殷文釗，趙鐵章，張益林，馬維元，孫文呈，韓繼湘，陸君福，沈章甫，姚兆塘，王敦甫，金誦甘，鄭學誥。</p>

<p>銀錢業各行莊奉部令，爲杜絕投機囤積抑平物價，審愼貸放後，銀行聯合凖備會曁錢業聯合凖備庫實施緊縮會員同業拆放，各行莊對於一切貸放，包括抵押，信用，以及往來透支等，已決定下列各原則：（一）抵押放款，對於以貨物爲担保者，極端審愼。凡有關民生之日用必需品，拒絕承做，前已做者，限期分別取贖絕對不准展期。各業正當商人之申請抵押，須保證持有之貨物非爲囤積圖利者，並限於各該本業之貨，例如棉布業祇准以經營之棉布爲抵押，不得以其他商品爲担貸款，申請貸款之工廠商號，須以該業同業公會會員爲限，期限至多不得超過二個月，並須說明請求貸款之用途，如經審査合格予以貸放後，承貸之行莊發覺其貸款用途不當，有立即追回欠款之權。（二）信用放款六個月畏期，依照向例分四底，十底，兩期，惟此後則特別審愼，並竭力予以緊縮，且以老戶信用素著，及從事生產事業者爲限，（三）須有殷實保證人担任償還本息之責。短期信用放款，由各行莊酌量辦理，並視承借者之營業情形，予以限制貸款，最高額。關於往來透支，依照原定透支額辦理，絕對不准通融超過透支額，至於凡不生產之公司行號往來，概予停止，蓋有利用信用放款及往來透支資金，投機操縱市價，以及囤積貨物，抬價居奇。聞自各行莊實施以上之限制辦法後、，一般利用行莊貸款資金之投機商人，勢必受極大之打擊，此舉實有助於制裁投機囤積及物價波動，使正當商人得以合法經營其業務云。</p>

<p>— 趙希賢</p>
<p>「游資」就是游離性的資本，資本是生產需要素之一，而游資是資本游離了生產本位，而進入消費性的資本，故游資在承平時代已是社會之贅，至戰時其爲患更烈。</p>
<p>自近數年來戰火燎遍全球，各項戰時之特殊現象，如社會不安，生產不足，幣制貶値等等，都使游資本主夢寐不安，他們爲本身生存起見，於是挾其游資，找尋出路，不顧法律，不顧道義，不顧國家社會之安全，在自私自利之目標下，無孔不入，謀取其利，加以戰事擴大，社會不安，一般企業，無從經營，企業家挾其資本，遷居安全地帶，於是游資羣集一隅，作祟更烈，故游資雖以自私自利爲出發點，但其目的則欲覓一安全園地而已。</p>
<p>上海爲國際性都市，一時游資集中一隅，據銀行非正式估計，爲數甚鉅，至足驚人，於是此龐大游資爲其本身出路起見，經營金匯，囤積貨物，同時生產激减，幣値貶縮，適逢其會，使一般盲目經營者大發其國難財，於是倒因爲果，以爲一切企業經營，尙不如稍事投機稍事囤積，其獲利反輕而易舉也，而游資本主誰願埋首投資經營生產事業，期待日久夜長之利得耶？</p>
<p>貿易自由在私有資本的今日，自屬無可誹議，但在戰爭非常時期，其行爲有類於後方搗亂，當局對於此項行爲取締頗爲積極，邇來當局對游資作祟之處置，有如下：（一）取締賣空買空之投機，以及囤積居奇，（二）限制押款。（三）提高拆息。（四）勸導投資農村。</p>
<p>其他則有提議設立有獎彩券，與設立行莊存款部等等。</p>
<p>觀於上述，游資的根本解決途徑，終不出經濟原則。資本旣是生產要素，我們仍須歸到生產本位，使之「歸元」而已導淮導河使之歸海，其途一也。我們的建議有如下列：</p>
<p>（一）由政府授權國策公司或另設專部，擬具一整個的經濟建設計劃——三年計劃或五年計劃，關於生產各部門如紡織，磨粉，造林，墾荒，畜牧等等，皆就其性質分別緊要或次要，按照計劃實行之。</p>
<p>（二）由政府發行一鉅額經濟建設公債，數額或三十萬萬或五十萬萬，酌定八厘利率，募集之公債，授權國策公司，根據已定計劃，作廣泛之投資，各項生產部門旣經整個計畫之下，其主要目標務期適合民生最低限度之需求，而生產過剩與不足之弊，自然不再存在，即生產經營者之避勞取巧與盲目投資之現象，亦不再見。</p>
<p>（三）政府對生產組織之投資，其性質概爲貸放性質，如某一生產組織經投資擴充後，即對政府有償本付息之義務，其利益可分述如下：（Ａ）政府對生產組織之投資，旣屬貸放之借款性質，則此鉅額公債之利息，即可由生產組織負担。（Ｂ）政府之投資旣爲貨放，則生產組織即須對政府按期償本付息，如此政府又可將資金循環投資另一生產組織。（Ｃ）經濟建設公債旣有政府爲其第一層担保，而又有規模宏大之生產組織爲其第二層担保，如此信用卓著自屬投資之安全樂園。</p>
<p>（四）生產組織之建設，大部份可就原有之生產組織，加以强制之擴充或合併，使小規模成大規模，古代化變爲近代化而已，如此旣省力而又收効速，自能迅速適合生民之需求，不致浪費時間。又生產組織旣屬現代化之大規模組織，且有政府爲其援助，信用自然卓著。但爲其本身發展起見，又可在公開市塲上發行股票，以爲伸縮之地，股票之發行，其利益有二：（Ａ）發行股票之後，即可利用外來投資，如此對政府投資可以加速償付，使之從速建設另一生產組織，最低限度勿使償本付息之延滯或擱淺，而簡接使經濟建設計劃，未能如期次第完成。（Ｂ）發行股票，則生產組織可在市塲上有餘地爲其伸縮，則其本身之發展，可不專恃政府爲其後援，如此則政府可有餘力經營其他建設而無後顧之慮矣。（Ｃ）此項股票信用卓著，自足使擁有游資者另得一安全之樂園矣。</p>
<p>（五）政府對於生產組織之投資，冀利率必須具有伸縮性，不能一律，因生產組織旣有勞逸不均之處，有的竟歷久不能獲利，有的竟獲利易而且厚，政府於此爲奧援起見，於不易獲利者須减低利率或予免利，獲利厚者則抬高利率，以期平均發展，而投資者顧此瞻彼，合算起來，可以相扯平衡，並無過份軒輊，自無樂此就彼選擇之必要。</p>
<p>（六）生產組織之經營必須政府委任著名之企業領袖負責經營之，政府僅予必要之督促與指導而已，簡言之即官督商辦是也，就過去事實而言，純粹官辦事業過份具有官僚意味，十九失敗，母庸諱言，一聞官辦事業，令人却步，故爲適應國情民習起見，必須假延企業領袖爲之經營，事實上，生產組織旣屬規模宏大之國營組織，而又有經騐豐富之領袖爲之經營，自屬錦上添花，足令人起信仰之心。</p>
<p>（七）生產組織旣屬國營，則無論原料供給，市塲推銷各方面，實具有壟斷專利性質，雖計利極薄，亦必甚可觀，政府對於此項之投資者，得另徵一種資本稅，並以資本稅收入爲償付公債之一部份。</p>
<p>（八）該項公債之還本須俟經濟建設計畫完成半程，方始還本，各項建設計畫如能如期吿成，則生產部門本身即能自立生產，同時即能吸取游資，自漸無賴政府資金之必須，如各項建設完全吿成，則游資納入正軌，政府自更無擁有鉅額資金之必要。</p>
<p>（九）游資得有投資之正確對象，從而進入企業國營化，從戰時經濟立足點觀之，尤爲當前之急務。</p>
<p>總之，凡百政事，非財莫舉。資本是百事之原動力，事實照然。中國生產落後，加以連年兵燹，以些小之資本，尙不作生產努力，而作游離性之消耗，國民經濟之前途危險實甚。故導之生產使之歸元，實爲當前之急務。方今鉅額游資苦無一安全獲利之出路，政府餌之以利，予以安全保障，導之生產，故今日之游資能善加利用，未始非復興中國之原動力。况公債用之於建設，並非政費流用可比，自爲民衆所樂聞。故此項計劃能次第實現，則目前盲目投機之現象，過份狂抬之證券，操縱飛漲之物價，囤積居奇之壟斷，種種民生杌揑不安之現象，自可一掃無遺。</p>

<h3 id="c82">工作和興趣 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>工作和興趣不是兩件不相關的事。相反的，要求工作有最大的效果，最優良的成績，我們就不能忽視了興趣這一個因素。</p>
<p>一個對工作發生興趣的人，他一定能工作得更好，更迅速，而覺得非常勝任；絲毫沒有痛苦。就是在他工作之路程上遭遇到很多很難克服的阻礙，他也沒有退縮灰心的意思。</p>
<p>大發明家愛迪生，要不是他對硏究工作發生了興趣，他不會從火車上趕了下來；打聾了耳朶後再從事於他的發明工作了。他一身的發明不能說不多，遭遇的困難不能說不少，但他終於能排除寓難。這無疑是堅毅忍耐精神的賜予，但未始不是興趣給予他工作的勇氣，在失望中領導他，勉勵他，完成了他一身的偉業。</p>
<p>興趣並不都是好的，我們應當在有益於人的事業上培植興趣，否則與人與己都要蒙受到不利。</p>
<p>因爲經濟，環境，客觀條件的限制，工作並不都能適合每個人的興趣，這樣「吃一行，怨一行」的怨言就產生了。要消除這種現象。我們可以從兩方面着手，第一也許沒有發見工作的眞趣，所以應當用工作去培植。第二工作根本不適性情，那末應當發掘自己的興趣所在，好好地栽培它，因爲有了好的修養，再找機會去發展，不會不成功的</p>
<p>工作能够解除煩惱，啟迪新的智慧，鍛鍊强健的筋骨。工作並不是受苦，工作就是興趣。什麽比工作完畢後的愉快更令人滿足呢？但是興趣究竟是什麽？這我不能吿訴你，我只能說：「它像一杯美酒，美味還要你自己去領略」</p>
<h3 id="c83">觀察與覺悟 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 啓洛</p>
<p>惟有觀察能增進我們的見聞，惟有覺悟能醞　我們的成功。</p>
<p>觀察是日常生活中非常重要的一件事。我們處身於這生存競爭的現實社會裏，如果不時時刻刻準確觀察，必將立刻被淘汰。胡思亂想是觀察的最大妨礙物，正如星星之火足以燎原一樣，我們必須設法撲滅它。</p>
<p>吉貝羅頻說：「夢想的人，乃是忘記了周圍的環境。而胡思亂想的人，他們時常耽於幻想的生活，對於現實生活則並不感覺興趣」。這句話，就是針對着專耽於空想，而不注意現實生活的人發的。</p>
<p>愛迪生說：「一般人腦中所記憶的事物，還不及他眼中所見的千分之一，從道裏可見我們的觀察力，眞是貧弱得可憐」。</p>
<p>像愛迪生這樣的注意力特强的大科學家，尙且自嘆觀察力的貧弱；何况一般享用他發明物的我們。可見觀察眞不是挺容易的一件事。</p>
<p>世人常因自負或懦怯，而不願自認他們的缺點，因此在他們的一生中，就埋下了許多不可測知的危機。這些危機能使他們被排擠出前進隊伍之外，而成爲身敗名裂的一份子。</p>
<p>先哲曾有一句名言：「明瞭你自己」。尋常，我們能够如數家珍地把他人指摘，但最不瞭解者，便是自己。有許多絕頂聰穎的人，對於他們本身的事，反　糢糊，這便是不能澈底覺悟的緣故。澈底覺悟等於　靜地旁觀。因爲當局者迷，旁觀者淸。</p>
<p>寳邦魯氏說：「每人必有若干未曾發現的缺點。許多人往往到了四五十歲以上，尙未覺察到使他們一生遭遇不幸的某些缺點」。所以，如果我們不能及早發現本身的缺點，而努力去矯正它。那麽，我們必不會輕而易舉地到達成功之康莊大道。</p>
<p>我人必先觀察，而然後能覺悟。如果我們未曾發現自己的缺點，那麽，我們也沒有什麽可以覺悟了。所以觀察與覺悟是有很密切的關係，同時它們也都是我們致成功的要素。</p>
<p>我們必須交觀察與覺悟，成爲我們的知友。時時刻刻在我們身旁，提醒並幫助我們處理複雜的事務。我們需要觀察力與覺悟力。</p>

<h3 id="c85">一月份徵文錄取第九名　我的生活—看護生 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴蕙蓀</p>
<p>我是一個看護生，一個預備將來做看護婦的看護生，在中國的社會裏，看護婦是被一般人們所賤視的，的確，看護婦所做的工作委實是下賤，斟藥倒茶以及給病人洗澡捧溺器，這誠好像是婢女們所做的事情，一般摩登的姑娘小姐們是不屑做的，我雖還未做到一個看護婦，不過在這一年多以來的實習工作，我却也做了許多看護婦的工作，我看到很多的病人，我感覺着一個人最痛苦最無聊的時候，是在害病時候，而看護婦是一切人們最痛苦最無聊的時候的看護者，解除了病人不少的痛苦無聊，我以爲這種的工作是非常的高尙，我以爲這種爲大衆謀幸福的工作才是人們應該做的工作！</p>
<p>我做看護生的第一年是只有念書，和一切的學生們一樣的念書，到了第二年的開始，才一方面念書，一方面在醫院裏的普通鬥診部做一點實習工作，這門診部所醫的是一些還沒有到臥床不起的病者，却也沒有什麼工作：只不過是聽醫師怎樣的探問病源，怎樣的下藥，怎樣的吩咐病者。以及　外科室幫助醫師替病者塗塗藥膏，紮紮綳帶而已。</p>
<p>在門診部實習了兩個月以後，我便被調到手術室實習，手術室是一個專門施行手術的處所，什麽開腹啊，鋸手鋸足啊，割瘤啊……眞是應有盡有，而我所實習的工作，乃是在未施手術以前應該樣預備和消毒儀器。以及施手術　看醫師怎樣麻醉病人和怎樣下刀。起初我看見外科醫師用他的利刀那樣快地在病人身上割來割去，甚至把五臟都翻出來，眞有點怕，但是幾次以後也就習慣了，有時候要施行比較大的手術，使得先用伊脫（Ether）把病人麻醉了，那時候病　完全不省人事，只剩下脈搏和心在跳動，以及急喘的呼吸，任什麼刀割都不覺得痛楚，這樣能够在一個時候把七情都忘了，眞是可憐而又可羨！遇着肓腸炎的病人到來，便要開腹，把腸的爛地方割掉，然後再縫好，使我眞是佩服科學的萬能；但是同時我又感到人類的矛盾；如果起先沒有發明這殺人的利器，又何必費盡心血和絞盡腦汁去想這救治的方法呢。</p>
<p>在手術室實習了兩個月以後，我又被調到住院部的產科室實習，這時候我所實習的工作是看護那些生產前後一兩個月的女人，和剛出世的小孩，這時我才知道生產小孩的痛苦，而悟到慈母的疼愛兒女原來是爲了這生產時的辛辛苦苦。平常一個女人在要生產的十二小時以前，便感着一陣陣的腹痛，呼娘喚爹地呻吟個不止，其痛苦眞是令人耳不忍聞，目不忍睹。到了生產以後，還要經過好幾月的身體衰弱，遇着難產的時候，還要動儀器甚至開腹才能把小孩抱出來，生孩子眞是不容易呀！至於孩子們，一些好的固然是肥白可愛，一些受了父母梅毒的遺傳的孩子，却又難看得很！重的骨瘦如柴，幾日便夭折，輕的也得成個終身殘廢，世間一切，跛足失明啞吧……的殘廢者原來都是爲了父母梅毒遺傳的緣故，我每次抱着梅毒孩子洗澡換衣服的時候，總要，恨恨地埋怨他們的父母幾句。</p>
<p>四個月後，我再被調到住院部的外科病室實習，這時候我的工作一變而爲看護外科病人了，那些經過手術的外科病人，在手術室爲了麻　的麻醉，並不覺得下刀時的痛楚；但是到了醒過來時，却又疼痛異常，呻吟不止，而且要經過兩三天的全身不能動彈，撒尿拉矢都要躺在床上，這時候是很需要人家看護的，其餘的都是一些折手斷足以及生大瘡口的外傷病人，這些病人很多醫好了要成爲殘廢的，所以我這四個月的外科室實習生活，是天天都在這些將近殘廢的病人和聽他們刺耳的叫痛的呼聲！</p>
<p>現在我是再被調到住院部的內科病室實習了，中國人的習慣定要到了病很重才肯進醫院的，所以這一些內科的病人幾乎都是將死的人了。他們完全和外科病人不一樣，他們都是到了身體非常衰弱的程度，他們不能似外科病人那樣地大聲呼痛，他們只是有氣無力地呻吟着，一部份的他們還常常有幾小時的昏去，這樣的病人是最難看護的，除了每天規定的檢溫，檢脈搏，檢呼吸，食藥和注射以外，還要不斷地到病房裏去看顧看顧他們，一不小心便會有斷氣之虞。</p>
<p>我因看慣了病人，深知病魔給予人們的痛苦，對於病人也就不期然而然地起了同情之心，總是極力去看護他們，安慰他們，　使我難過的就是遇到病人要死的時候，大都爲了捨不得家人，眞有所謂死不瞑目，在要斷氣時的惰景，眞是令人難忍而那些後死者的悲哀，那些後死者傷心的哭泣，男的，女的，老的，幼的，更常常使我也爲之流淚！更可憐的是那些異鄉飄泊者的客死他鄕，死的時候是沒有親人在身旁的，這情景够多麽凄凉！我看到這一切死別的悲哀，我眞希望着我會有起死回生的法術呀！</p>

<p>又是一片吵嚷聲。</p>
<p>「唉！…』黄崇菴嘆氣。</p>
<p>「崇翁，…」楊子傑勸慰。</p>
<p>兪篤周還是瞪着眼，根明却皺着眉。兪篤周確實在擔着心事，因爲此刻他已記起，前幾天楊子傑會代表黃崇菴對他說，開了除歷年，有功就要到他的私塾裏來讀書，黃崇菴說有功原來讀的一個私塾，敎法不好，以致有功的脾氣越變越壞。</p>
<p>根明則在苦苦硏究着：爲什麽有了這樣吃，偏要吃那樣；爲什麼這樣吃法不好，偏要那樣吃法。</p>
<p>『去叫三花來，只有去叫三花來，』母親略有決意的聲音，然後提高了些喉嚨喊着說：『錢媽，錢媽，去叫三小姐來。』</p>
<p>『我不吃，嘔嘔，……』還在哭着，不過聲音裏已沒有了力，正像遠去的雷聲，雖然在發着餘威，聽來也不過像殘蟬過別枝時的曳聲，一些不可怕，反見其有即刻沒落的悲哀。</p>
<p>片刻之後，忽然寂靜也統治了那間屋子。其他的人固然不再數說，勸解，便是有功也一些聲息都沒有，使這邊書房裏的人，暗暗地覺到，那間屋子裏已有了一個非常的局面，不，一定已出現了一個非常的人物。</p>
<p>『要吃就吃，不吃就拉倒，又是什麼大驚小怪的！』淸脆的聲音，朗朗地饗徹了兩面的屋子。『我看他不吃！』言下大有監視着的意味。</p>
<p>『吃了，吃了，三妹你請去吧。』薛鳳春含着笑意的話。</p>
<p>『我看他不吃！』這一句括在天井裏發了出來，接着，一陣細小而急促的脚步，將說這話的人送進了書房。</p>
<p>『三小姐來了，』根明第一個立了起來。『三小姐好，好久不見了，……』一連串地說下去，態度很自然，大非初進來時可比。</p>
<p>『王家伯伯，你好。』眞誠的問候。</p>
<p>『不敢當，託福。』　（七）社會服務</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Power to Secure National Stability <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>"The people are the root of the nation" – this is the core of all political theories of our country’s historical politicians. Therefore, "governing lies in winning the people." We have repeatedly said this to awaken the special attention of the authorities. But further, among all the people, which class is the main stabilizing force of our country? We know that the important stabilizing forces of modern powers are financial capital, industrial capital, and a large number of laborers. As for us, everyone knows that we "establish the nation on agriculture," and the vast majority are farmers. Then, the stabilizing force of our country should naturally be the majority of farmers. However, they do not yet play a decisive role in the fate of the country like the capitalists and laborers of the powers. In our country, there are no modern large capitalists, and there is a lack of laborers with decisive power over the country. Although the number of farmers is large, the universal phenomenon is lack of knowledge and organization, so there is no significant power. Therefore, the middle class, especially the progressive elements in the middle class, has the power to influence social and political trends. Moreover, in our country's traditional habits, politics and education are not separated. "One excels in learning and then serves as an official, and one excels as an official and then learns." Therefore, most of those in power are the intellectual class, that is, the middle class or middle-level elements in society. These people can not only influence the social and political atmosphere, but also occupy the most advanced leading position in national culture. The dynamics of the vast number of farmers follow them. Because there are extremely many illiterate people in our country, the ancient teaching of "the wind over the grass must bend" still has a practical effect. The habits, trends, and even hobbies of the general public follow the habits, trends, and hobbies of the middle class. Therefore, the middle class occupies a leading position in our society. Whether our society, politics, and culture can progress depends on the middle class or middle-level elements.</p>
<p>This important stabilizing force or leading class in our society includes school teachers and staff, low- and mid-level civil servants, people engaged in legitimate industry and commerce, and free professionals such as doctors, lawyers, technicians, journalists, and cultural figures. However, we must admit that for more than five years since the Incident, it is precisely these people who have suffered the most from the wartime economic situation. Experts in any field cannot but admit that, besides the working and peasant classes, the middle class, especially intellectuals or white-collar workers, suffers the most from the current high prices. Although the number of intellectuals is not large, leaders generally ridicule them by saying, "Scholars rebel and will not succeed in three years." However, in fact, given their important position in Chinese society, politics, and culture as mentioned above, the immense damage they suffer will inevitably affect the country and society. In wartime, everyone should endure hardship and abolish luxurious habits. However, the vast majority of the middle-level elements in our country have already lowered their living standards, to the point of affecting the health and spirit of their whole family, as well as their personal career and work efficiency. If this only harms them personally and their families and even their children, it is not very important. In a great era, it is right to sacrifice oneself and everything one owns for the country and the nation. However, the focus of the current problem is that the entire middle class, especially intellectuals, who have historically been the backbone of Chinese society, an important stabilizing force in society, and have always led society, may be completely on the verge of decline. To what extent this will cause loss and harm to the nation during wartime and after the war is a matter worthy of serious attention.</p>
<p>High prices and difficult living conditions are inevitable phenomena in wartime. However, if the damage of the wartime economy is only concentrated on an absolutely small number of people in the whole country, those with better knowledge, higher technical levels, and more complete and correct national and nationalistic ideas, thereby disrupting the normal order of the entire society and damaging the most powerful backbone force and important leading class of the country, then it should be called upon the entire country to quickly correct it. For the sake of implementing wartime policies and even more for the sake of post-war national construction, after calling for an improvement in the lives of civil servants, we sincerely call for supporting the middle class—middle-level elements, especially intellectuals—who are the important stabilizing force of the nation.</p>

<h3 id="e2">German-Italian Talks and Neutral Countries <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, representing Reich Chancellor Hitler, went to Rome and met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and others a total of four times. Regarding the Eastern Front, the recent battle of Tunisia, the major reorganization of the Italian cabinet a few days ago and the refreshing of the diplomatic ranks, as well as various military, political and economic issues between the two allied countries, the heads of the two countries gathered to discuss many things. As a result of the Rome talks, it was "confirmed that the Axis Powers (Germany and Italy) have the solid support of Japan and other allied countries, and have reached a complete consensus on ensuring the success of joint operations."</p>
<p>We have no doubt about the determination of Germany and Italy to fight with one heart in Europe and devote all their efforts until the final victory is achieved. It is really necessary to repeatedly clarify this point internally and externally in response to the enemy countries' malicious attempts to create discord. The positive cooperation between Germany and Italy in military and economic matters has been proven by significant facts, and no matter how the enemy countries incite propaganda, they will ultimately not be able to drive a wedge between Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>In addition to the strong unity of Germany and Italy in Europe, it is necessary to require France, Spain, and other Balkan countries to cooperate closely with the Axis countries during the current wartime and after the end of the war. The Rome talks "reiterated the determination of Germany and Italy to promote the activities of people of all countries in the Great European Sphere, protect mutual interests, preserve the survival of people of all European countries, and build a new order in Europe." This is vastly different from the Atlantic Charter that the United Kingdom and the United States boast about. If European countries cooperate openly and closely, the realization of a new order in Europe can be expected soon. Now, if the neutral countries only cooperate in the new order after the war, they will not be able to enjoy its rights. Therefore, for the sake of the future welfare of the whole, all countries should cooperate with Germany and Italy to the best of their ability during the war. Mere inner sympathy and empty promises of assistance are definitely not the attitude that should be taken to participate in the great cause of restoring Europe, which is easy to know but difficult to do, and to share a piece of the pie. On this point, it is hoped that Germany and Italy should step up their activities in politics and diplomacy. (Translated by Xiang from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, March 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e4">Nanjing to Hold Joint Sino-Japanese Offensive and Defensive Exercises Tomorrow; Celebrating Japanese Army Memorial Day <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - The 10th of this month is Japanese Army Memorial Day. Recalling thirty-eight years ago, on this day, our friendly country Japan defeated Russia in the great Battle of Mukden in Manchuria, marking the beginning of the war of liberation for East Asia. Since then, the awareness of self-consciousness among East Asian nations has grown day by day. Therefore, the launch of the Greater East Asia War two years ago was in fact a continuation of this spirit. Now that our country is participating in the Greater East Asia War and fighting side by side with friendly countries, this year's friendly army anniversary has historical significance. For this reason, the Nanjing Japanese Army Air Defense Headquarters will hold a large-scale joint Sino-Japanese land-air offensive and defensive exercise on the morning of this day, inviting more than 1,000 students from our country's military academies to participate, and inviting senior Chinese and Japanese officers, representatives of the military and civilians, students, and members of youth groups to visit. Since the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, China and Japan have fought side by side with the spirit of sharing weal and woe and the determination to live and die together under the goal of defending East Asia, thoroughly destroying Britain and the United States, and we are firmly confident of this. The foundation of this confidence was laid thirty-eight years ago. Therefore, Japanese Army Memorial Day is the first cry for the liberation of East Asia. It is not only a glorious memorial day for friendly countries, but also a glorious memorial day for the entire East Asia.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) The Japanese troops stationed in Nanjing will hold a live-fire offensive and defensive exercise at 9:30 am on the 10th, the 38th Japanese Army Memorial Day, to show their enthusiastic celebration. The air force will also assist in combat at the same time.

On the 23rd, after annihilating the Chongqing army in a certain area, it also defeated the Chongqing army near Sanjiao Village in southwest Xinjiang, inflicting a great blow to the Chongqing army in southern Jin and completely stopping its unrest. The Japanese army's battle results in February are recognized as follows: 217 engagements, 26,117 members of the Chongqing army engaged, 18,159 communist troops, 1,728 corpses of the Chongqing army, 1,174 prisoners, and a large number of heavy machine guns, light machine guns, and hand grenades were captured.</p>
<h3 id="e6">National Government Proclamation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th two years ago, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with our friendly nation, Japan. Since then, we have embarked on a new national movement, committed to ensuring public order and improving people's livelihoods, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and other countries continue to use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and they have intensified their efforts, even colluding with Chongqing elements to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front and send troops to Burma and India to slaughter East Asians. Recently, as their violence has been gradually defeated by the friendly Japanese Army and Navy, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost, they have become even more cunning. They are jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's ruling area, inciting Chongqing elements to constantly harass it in order to hinder the progress of various constructions, and even using their own aircraft, using Chongqing as a base, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, killing civilians. The Chongqing elements are willing to be driven by Britain and the United States, acting as traitors to East Asia, which is shameful. Britain and the United States have been scheming against East Asia for a long time, doing everything they can to sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, which East Asian nations should fight against with the same hatred. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States and will do its best to cooperate with our friendly nation Japan to sweep away the tyranny of Britain and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The nations of Manchukuo and Thailand have always maintained friendly relations and share a common desire for East Asian prosperity. In the future, we should strengthen cooperation to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been dealing with British and American forces in the West for several years and have repeatedly won glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and will echo each other in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our people should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Great Asianism of our National Father. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the achievement of justice, peace, and the integrity of the world all depend on this. Let us work together with one heart and one mind from beginning to end to carry out this great mission of this great era!</p>

<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) Various daily necessities in the capital have recently seen another surge in prices, and underground markets are rampant, greatly affecting the lives of citizens. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Lin Dazhong, the Director of the Nanjing Municipal Economic Bureau, to inquire about measures to suppress price increases and crack down on the black market. According to him, the Bureau is paying close attention to this issue. Considering that in order to suppress price increases and bring commerce back on track, the first step must be to reorganize the various trade associations in the city to make the association organization sound and have people in charge so that the method of material distribution can be carried out smoothly. Merchants can comply with the official price limits set by the authorities, and black market transactions can be eliminated invisibly. After the first step is completed, the first step of the plan will be implemented, such as increasing production. In short, I will do my best to ensure that merchants, under the guidance and cooperation of the government, strive to stabilize prices.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) According to Kangqing sources, Chongqing is recently using every problem as an excuse to ask Britain and the United States to strengthen aid to Chongqing. Therefore, it is very concerned about the aid to Chongqing cases currently being discussed in the British House of Commons. A spokesperson for Chongqing explained to a press corps on the 7th that what Chongqing most hopes for from British aid is that Britain will attack Burma from India. It was generally said that if Britain and the United States want to retake Burma, then sending hundreds of planes to Chongqing is an urgent matter. If Chongqing and Britain are fully prepared, and start joint operations from Assam and Yunnan at the same time, it is possible to succeed. In addition, the Chongqing "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" newspaper "National Daily" also called on Britain and the United States to urgently aid Chongqing in an editorial on the 6th, generally saying, "We hope that Britain can work with the United States to solve the difficulties of aiding Chongqing materials. We especially hope to reopen the Burma Road as soon as possible and strengthen the current Burma operations."</p>

<p>German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, representing President Hitler, arrived in Rome on February 24th. He met with Prime Minister Mussolini four times to comprehensively review the current situation in Europe. Both sides reached an agreement on the common measures to advance the war and he departed for Germany on the 28th.</p>
<p>The German Deputy Chief of Staff and the Italian Chief of Staff also attended the meetings on behalf of their respective military departments.</p>
<p>Mr. Ribbentrop's decision to visit Italy had three purposes: political, military, and economic. He aimed to study common measures between the two countries and review new strategies for advancing the war. Although the specific details remain unknown, based on the current situation, the following points can be inferred:</p>
<p>(1) To counter the political demonstrations by the Allied powers following the Casablanca Conference. The recent German counter-offensives on the Eastern Front and the new operations in central Tunisia, along with the victories of the Axis submarines, have objectively caused panic among the British and Americans. The Allies have miscalculated the timing of opening a second front in Europe. Germany and Italy are taking this opportunity to discuss ways to eliminate the Anglo-American encirclement of Europe, reviewing all political and military options. At the same time, they will agree to strengthen the European anti-communist front in order to cope with the overall European situation created by the Soviet winter counter-offensive.</p>
<p>(2) To ascertain Italy's attitude towards France in order to promote cooperation between France and the Axis powers.</p>
<p>(3) To utilize Italy's abundant human resources, especially labor, and to strengthen the flow of materials between the Axis powers and their allies.</p>
<p>(4) To jointly study how to counter the Anglo-American strategic warfare led by the Vatican, and to formulate countermeasures in advance. Furthermore, in order to prevent the crisis of the entire European continent turning red, it is necessary to align the humanitarianism and traditional anti-communism of the Vatican with the anti-communist and anti-Semitic stance advocated by the Axis powers in the war.</p>
<p>In summary, this meeting has further strengthened the unified relationship between Germany and Italy, which will surely consolidate the situation for the decisive battle. Regarding the second point we speculated above, it is rumored that the conditions proposed by the Italian side were quite severe. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop does not have the authority to make a decision on this matter, and it must be resolved through direct negotiations between President Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini. Therefore, it is expected that a meeting between the two leaders may take place soon. (Yun Peng: Translated from a Rome dispatch from the Mainichi Shimbun on March 3rd)</p>

<p>Lisbon, 8th, Allied News Agency: According to news received here from North Africa, Axis forces on the Tunisian front, responding to friendly forces on the northern front, have launched a large-scale offensive on the southern front since the 6th. The battle situation on the 7th is as follows:</p>
<p>In the north, Axis forces occupied Settnan on the 6th and continued to pursue the British First Army. On the 7th, they occupied Cape Sella, a key point on the Mediterranean coast northeast of Dameira. British forces are now regrouping in the Dameira area, attempting to stop the Axis advance. In the center, Allied forces launched counter-offensives in various locations. On the 7th, they launched a large-scale offensive in the Ussel Gabès area in the Mejez el Bab region. Although they briefly penetrated Axis positions, they were completely repelled after a fierce Axis counter-offensive. It is reported that Allied forces in the Gafsa area have approached a point two miles from Gafsa. In the south, Rommel's army has launched a major offensive since the 6th, intensifying the fighting on the southern front.

<h3 id="e22">General Overview of Important Industries in Japan (2) <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Non-ferrous metal industries are crucial during wartime. So we should remove every difficulty and make all-out efforts to increase production of airplanes. Airplanes industry’s basic materials are aluminum and magnesium. Those belong to light metal industries. Currently the scale and structure of Japan’s light metal industries are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>There are two kinds of raw materials for Aluminum. One kind is shale which contains abundant of soil buried in Manchuria and North China, also alums in Korea. The other kind is refined aluminum from Malay and other Southeast Asia areas. The first kind of raw material has very little content of Aluminum and has a lot of impurities. Compared to refined aluminum, it is technically inferior and less cost effective. The five main companies in the industry are Showa Denko, Sumitomo Aluminum, Japan Aluminum, Japan Light Metal, and Japan Soda. Each company manufactures aluminum using refined aluminum as raw material. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the assets of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands were frozen, completely cutting off the import of refined aluminum. Thus, domestic raw materials were used as a substitute. As a result of the Greater East Asia War, the highest quality and best characteristics in the world - the refined aluminum of the East Indies and Malaya - came entirely under Japan's control. After obtaining this treasure, the aluminum industry found a water source in the desert, establishing an absolutely unbeatable foundation on the raw material of refined aluminum.</p>
<p>Currently, there are 〇 aluminum manufacturing companies in Japan, excluding Manchuria. The Imperial Light Metal Control Company is responsible for unified distribution control. As the importance of the aluminum industry increased with the progress of the Greater East Asia War, the need for a high degree of unified control arose. As a result, the Light Metal Control Association was established on September 1st of last year based on the Important Industries Group Order. The officers of the Control Association:</p>
<p>Chairman: Atsushi Oya (Former Chairman of Sumitomo Aluminum). Managing Director: Sanzuro Kosobe (Former Managing Director of Imperial Light Metal). Director and General Affairs Manager: Daisuke Naka (Former Director of the Fuel Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry). Planning Manager: Harunosuke Miyano (Former Managing Director of Nichiman Aluminum). Aluminum Production Manager: Tsuguji Aose (Former Director of Japan Aluminum). Magnesium Production Manager: Otokoma Shimada (Former Managing Director of Imperial Light Metal). Distribution Manager: Shoichi Shinohara (Standing Director of Imperial Light Metal). Inspection Manager: Toku Takayama (Former Head of the Dispatch Section of Japan Light Metal). Technical Manager: Seiichi Sugimura (Former Director of Imperial Light Metal). Korean Branch Manager: Masao Uchino (Former Consignee of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry). Toyozo Fukuhara (Director of Imperial Light Metal). Kiyoshi Noda (Same).</p>
<p>The officers of the Control Association are composed of representatives from the above five important companies, and the Imperial Light Metal Company provides economic support. To integrate with the Control Association, Chairman Oya remains Chairman of the Imperial Light Metal Company, and three directors of the company also serve as directors of the Control Association, in order to achieve unified control of the production and distribution aspects through personal connections.</p>
<p>Chairman Oya is from Ibaraki Prefecture, and is 59 years old this year. He graduated from the Electrical Engineering Department of Tokyo University in Meiji 43. He worked at the Ministry of Communications for several years. In Taisho 7, he transferred to Sumitomo Headquarters, and in April of Showa 15, he became a Managing Director of the company. From Showa 16, he successively served as Chairman of Sumitomo Aluminum Smelting, President of Sumitomo Chemical, and President of Imperial Light Metal. He assumed the position of Chairman of the Control Association in September of last year, and continues in that role today.</p>
<p>Mr. Oya received a special award during his studies at Tokyo University. He is intelligent and thoroughly researches the truth of things with a scholarly attitude. He is very diligent in his work and has devoted all his energy to increasing the production of light metals, earning the trust of people in the industry.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the control of the aluminum industry is based on the Important Industries Group Order, and a Control Association is established. For important manufacturing factories, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry manages them directly based on the Factory Business Management Act of June last year. The Minister of Commerce and Industry directs and supervises the owners of various aluminum production factories. At the same time, management officials are dispatched to each factory and business site to thoroughly investigate and study the operational status of labor, materials, and power, and cooperate with the factory director to streamline operations. If obstacles are found, the Control Association and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will consult and resolve them. For example, 〇〇 factory has been able to operate smoothly thanks to the active efforts of the management officials. Therefore, people in the industry greatly welcome the deployment of management officials. This may lead to the expansion of the management system in the future development of wartime economy.</p>
<p>The United States' goal for this year's aircraft production is 10,000 aircraft per month, so they are working hard to expand the aluminum industry. Japan's measures to increase production to meet this year's decisive battle posture are: first, although the abundant refined aluminum from the South can be secured, under the current circumstances, due to restrictions on shipping and other transportation, only domestic raw materials, which are technically and economically less favorable, can be used to produce aluminum.</p>
<p>Nichiman Aluminum, Korean Riken Metal, and Nitto already use alumina shale to produce aluminum. This time, the Chemical Research Institute succeeded in using alunite from Mt. Amagi to produce aluminum. The large-scale use of domestic raw materials is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Second, maximize the use of existing equipment. New construction and expansion require time and resources, which are not available in the decisive battle stage. Therefore, only existing equipment can be utilized as much as possible to maximize its effectiveness. The Industrial Equipment Corporation will supply spare materials for repairs and supplements. How to improve the imbalance between the electrolytic capacity of aluminum and the manufacturing capacity of aluminum is also an urgent matter that requires comprehensive countermeasures.</p>
<p>Third, is the issue of technical exchange. The aluminum manufacturing industry requires a high level of expertise. It is very important to improve quality through technical exchange. Therefore, the Control Association has recruited leading technicians in the industry to join the Technical Cooperation Committee for careful joint research. The first publicly recognized and widely adopted technology by various companies is a type of non-calcination method for processing refined aluminum at the Yokohama Factory of Showa Electric Industries. When producing aluminum from refined aluminum, the refined aluminum is usually calcined to remove its combined water. The refined aluminum produced in Johor, Penang, Borneo and other parts of Southeast Asia contains about 30% combined water. Aluminum is difficult to dissolve unless it is melted and calcined. Now, without the calcination method, it is possible to save 〇〇 million tons of coal when processing one million tons of ore per year. In addition, it can save materials used for calcination, while aluminum production can increase by 20% to 30%. Therefore, this method is an excellent technology that achieves three benefits at once.</p>
<p>Japan Soda has also adopted a part of this method. Nippon Light Metal is also making various preparations to adopt this method. If all other factories adopt this method, a landmark effect can be achieved in increasing aluminum production.</p>
<p>Finally, the tendency that the aluminum manufacturing industry should pay attention to is the plan for various companies to enter Korea. The aluminum manufacturing industry requires a large amount of electricity, so future expansion will inevitably take place in Korea and Manchuria. Showa Denko and Sumitomo Aluminum Industries have been in communication with relevant authorities and are now preparing to enter Korea. This, along with Nippon Light Metal's plan to enter Taiwan, is the second expansion of production capacity in the country's long-term plan. It is a necessary condition for establishing the Greater East Asia defense posture.</p>
<p>Magnesium has a lighter specific gravity than aluminum, and its alloys have strong resistance to impact. Therefore, it is an absolutely necessary material for aircraft landing wheels and an indispensable raw material for manufacturing incendiary bombs and flares. With the progress of the war, the production of magnesium must also be increased dramatically. Currently, there are ten magnesium production companies in Japan: Japan Magnesium, Japan Magnesium Metal, Toyo Metal, Okura Mining, Asahi Denka, Kanto Denka, Toa Light Metal, Mitsubishi Magnesium, Shin-Etsu Chemical, and Riken Metal. The raw materials for manufacturing are bittern, a by-product produced during salt production, and magnesite, which is abundant in Korea and Manchuria. The scale of operation is small, and the magnesium manufacturing technology is kept strictly secret by various countries around the world. Therefore, it is about ten years behind the aluminum manufacturing industry, and the production cost is also not very high. The above-mentioned Control Association controls and adjusts its appropriate selling price. To promote the increase in production, the scale of operation is increased to an appropriate level. The first measure implemented was to merge the magnesium manufacturing division of Okura Sangyo with Toa Light Metal to establish the Imperial Magnesium Manufacturing Company. The new company is currently preparing to be established. In the future, the enterprises in the magnesium manufacturing industry will be adjusted one by one.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned new company's magnesium manufacturing method involves mixing limestone with seawater to create magnesium hydroxide. Magnesium is then produced from magnesium hydroxide. This is Japan's most primitive method. Even though the deposits of magnesite in Korea and Manchuria are abundant, the current transportation restrictions make it absolutely advantageous to use easily obtainable seawater as a raw material as a measure to increase production. The Control Association is currently encouraging magnesium manufacturing companies in the mainland to adopt this method. This is a noteworthy trend in preparing the magnesium manufacturing industry for the decisive battle posture. (Sho: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on March 1st)</p>

<p>— Di Ling</p>
<p>(1) Military Expansion Before Entering the War</p>
<p>The United States formally prepared for war more than a year and a half before the Greater East Asia War, around the early summer of 1940. By May 1940, the disastrous defeat of Britain and France against the Axis powers in Western Europe was a foregone conclusion. The humiliating defeat of British imperialism not only caused American imperialism to feel a "fox mourning its kind," but also threatened its ambition to dominate Europe, as well as its activities in the Mediterranean and West Asia. Under these concerns, the policy of aiding Britain was decided, and the plan for military expansion was launched. As a result, American finances experienced astonishing inflation. The military expenditure for the 1940-41 fiscal year was originally budgeted at $1.539 billion, but the actual expenditure was $6.463 billion. The military expenditure accounted for 18.2% of the total expenditure in the original budget, but rose to 48.9%. The increase in military expenditure was due to an increase of $3.8 billion in the 1940-41 expenditure over the previous year's $12.7 billion. The above figures are actual expenditures. The military expenditure alone passed by Congress from May to October 1940, within half a year, reached eight times the original budget, amounting to $12.699 billion.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1940, Britain encountered a German counter-blockade and became even more isolated. As a result, the export of military supplies from the United States to Britain began and increased. In August 1940, a new record appeared, with exports to Britain accounting for 85% of the total exports of the United States. In 1940, American exports to Britain amounted to $1.1 billion, an increase of 93.7% compared to the pre-war year of 1938. At the end of 1940, Britain again became insolvent. Therefore, the United States began to lend only physical goods to Britain, leading to the passage of the Lend-Lease Act. The Lend-Lease Act was submitted to Congress on January 10, 1941, and after two months of discussion and debate, it was finally signed into law by the President on March 11. According to this legislation, the budget established by the end of March 1941 was $7 billion, by the end of October of the same year it was $5.985 billion, and by mid-February 1942 it was $5.425 billion, totaling $18.41 billion. According to this budget, the actual military supplies shipped to Britain from March 1941 to August 1942, a period of one and a half years, amounted to $6.489 billion. However, this figure is only the amount of military supplies actually shipped from the United States to Britain. In fact, the amount spent by the United States under the Lend-Lease Act was much larger, that is, the actual expenditure in the one year from March 1941 to February 1942 was about twice the amount shipped to Britain, reaching $12.272 billion. As President Roosevelt said on June 15, 1942, the production of loaned weapons was $8 billion a year, accounting for about 15% of the total military production.</p>
<p>(2) Military Expansion Movement After the Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, American military strategic bases in the Pacific, such as Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, were repeatedly damaged, and the United States further actively expanded its military armaments.</p>
<p>Shortly after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in January 1942, Roosevelt submitted a message to the U.S. Congress. From the perspective of actual military production expenditures, January was $2.1 billion, February was $2.9 billion, April was $3.4 billion, and May was $4.4 billion, showing a sharp increase. The increase in expenditures in the second half of the period can be seen from the figure of $32.4 billion for the 1941-42 fiscal year (July 1941 to June 1942).</p>
<p>The budget for the 1942-43 fiscal year was estimated at $58.9 billion in the budget message submitted by the President to Congress in early 1942. According to a long report submitted to Congress by President Roosevelt on October 16, 1942, the budget included $74 billion in military expenditure and exceeded $80 billion. In the 77th Congress of 1942, which adjourned on December 16, 1942, a new budget of $200 billion was passed. Of course, this includes not only the supplementary budget for the 1942-43 fiscal year, but also the supplementary budget for the 1941-42 fiscal year, and the budget based on the Lend-Lease Act. This also shows the astonishing expansion of the budget passed by the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>In the current fiscal year (since July 1942), the actual expenditure figures of the United States have increased at a high speed. For example, the actual expenditure in September 1942 reached $5.384 billion. The expenditure on military equipment in June 1940 was $150 million, almost less than the current daily expenditure. That is, the expenditure in September increased by 400% compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>As a result of this desperate military expansion, according to Donald Nelson, head of the U.S. Military and Supplies Bureau, on September 21, 1942, military expenditures in the first seven months of 1942 were equivalent to 36% of the U.S. national income. Looking back, military expenditures in 1941 accounted for only 14% of national income, in 1940 only 4%, and in 1939 even less at 2%. This shows the great increase in military production. According to Nelson's speech that day, military production during the above period accounted for 40% of the total U.S. production during the same period, and in 1942 it would reach 60%.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt further submitted the 1943-44 budget to the 78th U.S. Congress at the beginning of 1943. It is said to be an unprecedentedly large budget plan with a total amount of $103 billion, of which military expenditure reached $96 billion, an increase of 70% compared to the $53 billion in military expenditure in the original budget for the 1942-43 fiscal year. Such a huge military expenditure accounts for more than $8 billion per month. If the supplementary budget is added, then the monthly military expenditure will exceed the $10 billion mark.</p>
<p>(3) The Goals of the United States in 1943</p>
<p>What are the goals of such military expansion? In the first year of the Greater East Asia War, the United States put forward the slogan "Remember Pearl Harbor." The slogan for the second year was "From defensive to offensive!" The United States, which was forced to retreat from the Pacific in the first year of the Greater East Asia War, has been inspiring national morale by invading French North Africa since mid-November, greatly publicizing "The Second Army is the counter-offensive army!" So, what is the true meaning of the strategic offensive of the United States in the future?</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of this World War, the United States has sold 50 destroyers to Britain in the summer of 1940 in order to defend Britain. At the same time, as a condition of exchange, it obtained the right to turn the British West Indies into American naval and air force bases. Before and after this event, in August of the same year, Canada established the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Committee, and the United States expanded its power over Canada's vast territory. In fact, American foreign policy has used this war to strengthen its control over the Western Hemisphere. Today, Americans have regarded Canada as the "49th state" newly established after the 48 states of the United States. Moreover, at that time, the United States was still in the neutral circle, and it began to extend its control from Central and South America, excluding the rights of Britain, Germany, and Italy in Latin America, supporting the rights of the United States, and ordering the countries of Central and South America to stop trading with the Axis powers. After the Greater East Asia War, almost all countries in Central and South America have successively joined the war. By August 1942, Peru, and in January 1943, Chile, had also declared war.</p>
<p>In May 1942, the United States invaded French Martinique in the West Indies, and from then on extended its power eastward, reaching the west coast of Africa. Since July 1942, the U.S. military has successively operated in French Equatorial Africa, Belgian Congo, British Nigeria, and Freetown. In October, it stationed troops in the Republic of Liberia, threatening all French African colonies. On November 7, the U.S. military violently invaded French North African colonies. The ambition to carry out military aggression against Africa, Europe, and even the Near East and Central Asia has begun to be exposed to the world! As for East Asia, while Japan has been driven out of important bases in the Pacific, Britain's recent abandonment of its ambition to counter-attack, and its "aid" to Chongqing and the Soviet Union, are naturally another manifestation of the U.S. attempt to restore its hegemonic ambitions in East Asia.</p>
<p>A military reporter for the New York Times once said that British troops are now stationed at more than 50 strategic points around the world. This is by no means a worthless statement.</p>
<p>In the process of the disintegration of the British Empire, all the territories under the former British Empire are successively returning to the banner of the United States, and all French colonies are also gradually being encroached upon by the American military.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Following Napoleon's Advancement Route, the War Intensifies, German Troops Abandon Sychevka, Soviet Troops Southwest of Kharkov Annihilated <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>German Leader's Headquarters, Haidong News Agency, 8th. This afternoon's German military report stated that powerful German forces southwest of Kharkov yesterday defeated enemy resistance and advanced to the west of the city. Soviet forces repeatedly attacked in the Orel region but were unsuccessful. The enemy's attacks in the central sector, attempting to hinder the German army's operations, were all repelled. The German army, in accordance with its original plan, has now withdrawn from the city of Sychevka in West. South of Lake Ilmen, the fighting was extremely fierce yesterday. Soviet forces launched fierce attacks, but were heavily damaged and repelled by our defending forces. German aircraft assisted in the battle, shooting down sixty Soviet aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, Haidong News Agency, 8th. Haidong News Agency recently learned from responsible authorities that the German army has withdrawn from the city of Sychevka south of Rzhev (Sychevka is 120 miles west of Moscow) in accordance with its original plan. This plan has been prepared for some time, and its purpose is to correct the German positions in the central sector of the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, Havas News Agency, 8th. On the Eastern Front, from the city of Orel south to the Sea of Azov, the climate is mild and conducive to German military operations. Therefore, yesterday the Red Army only launched an offensive in the ice and snow area north of the city of Orel. The line from the city of Orel north to Staraia Russa, stretching for 700 miles, has extremely strong German positions. According to Berlin sources, repeated Red Army attacks have been repelled and have suffered heavy damage. On the Soviet side, it is claimed that the Red Army is advancing north from the city of Gzhatsk (south of Rzhev), occupying many towns and cities, but it also admits that the Red Army has encountered strong German resistance. The two sides are engaged in fierce battles along the road traveled by Napoleon's army in 1812, and the outcome is still undecided. The locations of the Red Army's attacks are the four cities of Velikiye Luki, Rzhev, Vyazma, and Smolensk, forming a four-sided formation. Last night, the fighting around the city of Vyazma was particularly fierce. It is reported that the German army is resolutely resisting the Red Army's attempts to approach the city. The Red Army is still thirty miles away from the city. According to the Red Army's war report, "The Red Army is still launching offensives in the previous directions." A Soviet official supplement stated that a German ship of 6,000 tons was sunk in the Barents Sea, and 129 German aircraft were shot down this week. The Soviet side also lost 76 aircraft. Finally, it was officially announced that the Red Army occupied 74 densely populated villages north and southwest of the city of Gzhatsk, but the locations were not specified. In the southern sector, especially in the Donets and Kupiansk regions, the German army has been on the offensive for the past two weeks, continuously attacking the retreating Red Army.</p>
<p>Berlin, Haidong News Agency, 8th. The Soviet Third Tank Army south of Kharkov was annihilated. The number of Soviet soldiers' corpses left on the battlefield has reached 28,000. The number of prisoners and captured war trophies has not yet been calculated. The Soviet army resisted fiercely, so the number of prisoners may not be very large. The German army continues to carry out mopping-up operations at the Kupiansk bridgehead, capturing hundreds more prisoners. More than 600 Soviet soldiers were killed. The Soviet 58th Army suffered extremely heavy losses. The Soviet concentration of new forces north of the bridgehead has been repelled. German tank units advanced towards the Sea of Azov, defeating a Soviet unit of about 1,200 men. West of Orel and north of Staraia Russa, the enemy continues to launch large-scale offensives. The Soviet army dispatched seven infantry divisions and three tank brigades west of Orel, launching fierce attacks but failing. The Soviet attacks west of Sukhinichi have been going on for more than two weeks, and the offensive has now subsided slightly. Fierce fighting is still taking place south of Lake Ilmen.</p>

<p>Berlin, Haidi News Agency, 8th. According to information received here last night, German and Croatian forces launched a mopping-up operation against guerrillas in Bosnia last month, occupying the Pihac and Vruni districts. A second large-scale offensive is now underway. A few days after launching the second offensive, German and Croatian forces captured the city of Glamoc and seized a large amount of clothing, war equipment, and food. The Bosnian Communists are now operating in small mountain villages near the Dalmatian border. (Editor's note: Bosnia is the name of a province in southwestern coastal Yugoslavia.)</p>

<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency, 8th. General Jiro Minami, Privy Councilor of Japan, recently inspected various parts of the South for more than a month. He arrived in Fukuoka by plane at 1:15 p.m. today and gave a special speech, saying, in brief, that the military and political affairs in the South are on the right track and have spread to all parts of the region. Public security has almost been completely restored. There are occasional movements of a small number of enemy aircraft and submarines in Myanmar, Java, and other islands from the eastern end to New Guinea, but there is no major action. Therefore, the administration, which focuses on combat but also proceeds simultaneously, is also progressing smoothly. After the Asian residents have broken away from the shackles of countries such as Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, they are now sincerely cooperating in building a new East Asia as members of Asia. Prime Minister Tojo's statement in his speech to the Diet that he would recognize the independence of Myanmar and the Philippines has given great comfort to the residents of those places. In particular, Myanmar is even more excited because its independence can be realized this year. Moreover, the construction of Myanmar is very promising. Iron, oil, and various other underground resources are being explored. About 80% of the port facilities and the salvage work of enemy sunken ships have been completed. The residents are all cooperating with Japan with great determination to complete the construction of Greater East Asia, so the propaganda of Britain and the United States has no effect. In short, the security and resource development in various parts of the South have made great progress, and the situation of certain victory has been completely established.</p>

<p>Jakarta, Central News Agency, 8th. The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in Java issued a statement on the occasion of the first anniversary of the establishment of Japanese rule in Java, saying that looking back on the past year, the elite Japanese army conquered Java and established the foundation for building a new Java. It has been one year since then. On this significant anniversary, recalling the scenes at that time makes people feel sincerely grateful, especially to the heroic spirits who died valiantly in the Java conquest. Now the security of Java has been completely established, and the government orders have been carried out throughout the island. Moreover, thanks to the sincere trust and cooperation of the residents of the entire island with the Japanese army, the progress of the construction of the new Java is truly advancing by leaps and bounds, which is what we are most pleased to see. From the perspective of the overall situation of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has established a situation of certain victory and invincibility, and its final victory must belong to us, which is beyond doubt. However, we should not be negligent because of this. We must know that there are still many hardships ahead of the war, which we must overcome. This is what we must realize. Military officers and civilians must uphold the declaration of war and clarify the imperial edict. From now on, we must work together with one heart and one mind, eliminate selfishness, and devote ourselves to public service, and advance toward the goal of all things in harmony.</p>
<p>Jakarta, Central News Agency, 8th. The Japanese Military Administration Department implements the military-political alliance in Java and employs indigenous officials to assist in promoting military and political affairs. This has contributed a lot to the construction of the new Java. Recently, in order to enable indigenous officials to assume the responsibility of educating the general public, to understand the true meaning of the East Asia War, and to make a firm determination to cooperate in the war, it was decided to establish a new official system on the anniversary of the first anniversary of Java's rule. Currently, a draft is being prepared. The new system is based on safeguarding the status and life of indigenous officials, so that they can dedicate themselves to the construction of the new Java system, and respecting the New Greater East Asia concept of Javanese customs. It is the first new indigenous official system formulated by Japan in the occupied territories of the South, so it is attracting much attention.</p>

<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency, 8th. Yokohama telegram, After the news of Mahatma Gandhi's safe completion of his fast, Indians living in various parts of East Asia were all extremely encouraged, which greatly increased their determination to strive for the independence of their motherland. The Yokohama branch of the Indian Independence League held a "Completion of Independence Prayer Ceremony" at the Basaran Temple at 10:00 a.m. today, attended by branch director Sadani and 28 Indian compatriots. Then, at 1:00 p.m., a "Indian Independence Completion Lecture Conference" was held at the Kannai Memorial Hall, which was very lively. After the opening address by Sadani, director of the Yokohama branch of the Indian Independence League, Okawa Shumei, Noguchi Yonejiro, and Kimura Nikki, authorities on Indian issues in Japan, successively gave speeches, strongly advocating that India should first overthrow Britain and the United States in order to promote the timely rise of the Indian nation. Afterwards, Sadani, director of the Yokohama branch of the Indian Independence League, told reporters that the Anglo-Saxons are indeed the common enemy of the East Asian nations. This time, they wanted to harm Gandhi, who is revered by our Indian people. All 400 million Indian people are praying for God's blessing. Fortunately, Gandhi has safely completed his fast. His fast has made us deeply feel the cruelty and injustice of Britain, and has increased our determination to strive for the independence of our motherland. We Indians are determined to do our best to continue fighting and drive the British out of East Asia. We firmly believe that this is inevitable. The Japanese government's statement that it does not regard Indians as enemies and does not apply the law freezing enemy property has dealt a deep and significant blow to the enemy, while all of us Indians are deeply grateful, and it is of infinite encouragement to the Indian independence movement.</p>

After the retailers have been re-registered and merged, it has been decided that there will be (1) more than 130 retailers in the Public Concession, and (2) more than 110 retailers in the French Concession. Each retailer will be assigned a registration number. However, each registration number is not a single number, but is based on the rationed quantity. The sugar distributed to each retailer in February has been properly stored for the distribution of sugar to households in March. The validity period of the first coupon of the sugar certificate is from March 11 to March 31. The quantity is fixed at eight taels per person, regardless of whether they are adults or children. The price will be sold according to the revised price announced on March 2, which will be announced jointly by the Cooperative Business Office, the Public Works Bureau, and the Board of Directors of the Public Concession. As for the sugar distribution based on population in Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai, preparations have been made. The sugar purchase certificates have been issued by the Food Administration Bureau when distributing household food rations. They will be implemented simultaneously with the two concessions. The quantity, price, start date, and end date will be exactly the same for the sake of fairness.</p>
<p>The 29th Phase of Rice Rations: A Total of Two and a Half Sheng</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's Information Office announced that the Bureau had recently issued Notice No. 6286, explaining that the validity period of Coupon No. 28 of the Rice and Flour Certificate will end on the 9th of this month, and will be invalid after the deadline. From the 11th to the 19th of this month, the Bureau's rice sales offices and rice stores will only sell rice and flour based on Coupon No. 29 of the Rice and Flour Certificate. At that time, the rice stores with registered numbers marked on the coupon will sell one and a half sheng of white rice or brown rice and one sheng of broken rice for each rice purchase certificate coupon, with a total selling price of six yuan and three jiao. In addition, one and a half jin of No. 2 flour and four liang of No. 3 flour will be sold for each flour certificate coupon, with a total selling price of three yuan, eight jiao, and five fen. Furthermore, all rice stores and the Bureau's rice sales offices will suspend sales for one day on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil and Miscellaneous Grain Certificates: Two Days for Supplementary Issuance</p>
<p>The offices for issuing rice purchase certificates in the Public Concession first issued the eighth batch of rice flour purchase certificates and sugar purchase certificates from the 22nd of last month, and then continued to issue cooking oil certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates from the 1st of this month. According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, most of the taxpayers in the Central, Northwest, East, and West districts have received the above-mentioned purchase certificates since they were issued, and they have been distributed evenly to each dependent household. Therefore, each certificate issuing office has set the 9th as the last day for issuing purchase certificates. The 11th and 12th will be specifically for the supplementary issuance of cooking oil and miscellaneous grain certificates to those who have only received rice flour purchase certificates and sugar purchase certificates.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Federation, to ascertain the amount of coal stock in Shanghai, specifically sent a letter to Da Zhong Lian Coal Company last month, responsible for re-registering coal stocks. After Da Zhong Lian Coal Company forwarded the letter to the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association and the process began, nearly ten days have passed. A reporter learned yesterday that Da Zhong Lian Coal Company has decided to extend the deadline for coal stock registration to the 10th of this month. Therefore, all fellow businesses who have not registered must obtain and submit the forms before this date. Failure to do so will result in restrictions on the movement of said coal, with the authorities taking action. According to news from the coal industry, coal shipments to Shanghai have continuously arrived, mostly from North China and Korea. Therefore, the amount of coal stock in the city is increasing daily.</p>

<p>The military authorities have designated the Shanghai Special Municipal Liquor Industry Friendship Association to handle liquor rationing in the city. The Bureau of Public Works' Goods Control Department has also assessed and set price limits for various types of liquor. However, for the past two months, liquor market prices have been volatile. To stabilize valuations, the Friendship Association has drafted comprehensive measures to promote the welfare of its members. Hotel members can apply to the Association and declare their monthly requirements to facilitate readjustment.</p>
<h3 id="e42">All Charity Organizations Plan to Relocate to the Countryside: Due to Financial Difficulties and Heavy Burden, Hoping for Donations from All Sectors to Evacuate Distressed Children from the City <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The English-language *North-China Daily News* reported that a member of the China Children's Welfare Association yesterday continued to request public donations to facilitate the evacuation of more distressed children from the city, after the relocation of five charity organizations to nearby rural areas, and to prevent them from stopping due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Supporting Children Requires Public Assistance</p>
<p>It is stated that sending distressed children to the countryside is one of the best strategies in the charitable plan. However, in reality, without financial support, it is impossible to send more groups of children to the countryside. As for the five charities that have already moved to Suzhou and its neighboring areas, they are said to have sufficient funds and are not worried about financial difficulties. However, the Association relies on continued public support to sustain the children.</p>
<p>Planning to Resolve Donation Issues</p>
<p>Charity organizations currently remaining in Shanghai plan to relocate to the countryside to reduce their burden. However, the public often assumes that since these organizations are moving to the countryside, they are no longer relevant to Shanghai and are unwilling to donate funds for relocation expenses. The China Children's Welfare Association is devising solutions to this difficulty to smoothly send the children to the countryside.</p>
<p>Distributing Over a Thousand Pieces of Winter Clothing</p>
<p>The member also revealed that in the past three months, the China Children's Welfare Association distributed 1,379 sets of clothing to various charity organizations for distribution. At that time, 2,000 sets of clothing were made, costing 30 yuan per set, funded by public donations. Currently, 621 sets remain in the Association's possession, ready to be distributed to other needy children without clothing.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Achievements of the Clean-Up Campaign in Southeastern Taihu Lake Area <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Symbol of Tranquility and Security</p>
<p>The second phase of the Clean-Up Campaign in the southeastern Taihu Lake area covers the areas of southern Songjiang, Jinshan, Pinghu, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Haiyan, and Haining. These places were designated as new administrative districts in January of this year. The area of these seven counties is approximately 80 kilometers east to west and 30 kilometers north to south, with a total average of about 2,500 square kilometers. This area is an agricultural region, with the main products being rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, so people consider these seven counties, like Huzhou, as the granary of Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>This area is adjacent to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Line, and both land and water transportation are well-developed. However, in the past, the security was not very stable, and administrative power was not easily implemented in this area, because it was too close to Shanghai. So the kind of bad influence from Shanghai flowed into these places. These places were routes for smuggling important materials into Shanghai, so people thought that these smugglers hindered the improvement of security.</p>
<p>The system for smuggling goods is roughly as follows: salt produced in Yuyao and other places is smuggled in through Zhapu, Jinshanwei, and other places. Flour and miscellaneous grains produced in Wuxi and Changzhou are smuggled out through Songjiang. Rice from Jiaxing and Jiashan is smuggled through Pinghu, Minhang, and other routes. Ships traveling horizontally and vertically on the water are also effective tools for smuggling materials. Similarly, materials can also be smuggled from Shanghai to the interior. Materials from Shanghai are mostly transported to Songjiang and other places, some by boat and some by manpower, using the so-called "bee-style" method of smuggling exports. Songjiang, Jiaxing, and other places are collection and distribution points, and from there they are transferred to the interior. Most of the people who engage in smuggling are local ruffians and hooligans who depend on smuggling for a living. There is also a portion of the working class who rely on this for a living. This extremely unreasonable situation has led to the deterioration of security in this area, hindering the implementation of administrative power.</p>
<p>The second phase of the Clean-Up Campaign in the southeastern Taihu Lake area began in October of last year. Since its implementation, with the active efforts of the authorities and the cooperation of the people, security has improved significantly. Now, people can freely and safely enter and exit the area. The hooligans who engaged in smuggling have also been expelled, and the workers who engaged in smuggling after losing their jobs have to return to legitimate employment. The people constantly smuggling materials along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Line are no longer seen.</p>
<p>Now, the number of people traveling between rural and urban areas has increased significantly, which is clear evidence that security has been restored. Jiaxing and Xiashi, the cities in the countryside, are crowded with people from the surrounding villages every day. Tea houses, restaurants, and theaters are always full, and the prosperity is beyond description.</p>
<p>Economic Revival</p>
<p>Before the Clean-Up Campaign, smuggling could bring in some illegal profits, so it made some contributions to the economy. Since the Clean-Up Campaign, the economy has been blockaded, and materials are managed. This illegal profit has been completely eliminated. Step by step, a legal and proper economy is being built. This area is known to all as a prosperous area. Local products are more than enough to feed the local people. Below is a comparison table of rice production and consumption in this area:</p>
<p>County Name Rice Production Rice Consumption</p>
<p>(Unit: 1,000 Stone) (Unit: 1,000 Stone)</p>
<p>Jiaxing and Jiashan 645 472</p>
<p>Pinghu 238 264</p>
<p>Haining 60 72</p>
<p>Haiyan 70 71</p>
<p>Jinshan 643 425</p>
<p>Total 1,656 1,304</p>
<p>The above statistics are based on the reports of the counties before the Clean-Up Campaign. Now, there may be inaccuracies, but this is not known. But looking at the above figures, there is of course a considerable surplus. Other major products include approximately 400,000 stone of wheat, 200,000 stone of broad beans, 113,000 stone of soybeans, 15,000 dan of rapeseed, 20,000 dan of orchid seeds, 60,000 dan of watermelons, and various others. Along the coast, there is also a lot of edible salt and fresh fish. Fuel (firewood) is also abundant.</p>
<p>The security in this clean-up area is stable, and the people can live and work in peace, which has led to an increase in production. Cultivating one more mu and harvesting one more dou is what any farmer hopes for. Now, the authorities in charge of the Clean-Up Campaign are working hard to guide production and find ways to collect fertilizer, so the increase in production in the future is worth looking at.</p>
<p>In the southeastern Taihu Lake clean-up area, the agricultural progress is relatively greater in Songjiang and Jiaxing, Jiashan. The cost of fertilizer used per mu is 160 yuan, and the harvest is about 2 shi to 2.5 dou of rice.</p>
<p>Purchasing and distribution agencies are gradually being prepared, and the results are likely to be good. The designated merchants of the rice purchase cooperatives have a close relationship with the local rice industry associations. Recently, the controlled purchase of edible oil and miscellaneous grains has also been organized, and organized purchasing work has also been extended to edible oil and miscellaneous grains. As for the distribution of materials, it is distributed by the Japanese-Chinese Commercial Association to retailers, but some believe that the quantity distributed to the Chinese side needs to be increased.</p>
<p>Establishment of Local Finances</p>
<p>In the past, these places were not very wealthy financially. The largest source of local taxes was of course land tax, but only Jiashan County had such land tax registers and land donation registers, which were not complete. It was simply impossible to find a way to collect land tax. In this situation, how could the collection of land tax be successful? Taxpayers only wanted to pay less, and tax collectors only wanted to enrich themselves. However, the provincial and county governments had no way to thoroughly investigate the cause of this tax revenue decline.</p>
<p>With the progress of the Clean-Up Campaign, all land relations and cultivation systems will naturally become clear. Land tax revenue has gradually improved. Last year, the total collection exceeded 22 million yuan. It is unclear how much land tax revenue was in the past, but it is estimated that it was less than one-tenth of the current amount. This 22 million yuan is entirely thanks to the Clean-Up Campaign. From this alone, it can be seen how important the Clean-Up Campaign is.</p>
<p>The tax rate adopted in the second phase of the Clean-Up area is the same as in Jiangsu Province, with a maximum of 20 yuan per mu. However, there are also differences depending on the grade of the fields. If it is possible to collect according to this tax rate, it is expected that this area can generate 45 million yuan. According to the Clean-Up authorities, the same tax rate will be adopted as in Jiangsu Province in the first year, but at some point, they plan to reduce the tax rate.</p>
<p>The southeastern Taihu Lake area was previously a desolate area in terms of politics and finance. However, since the Clean-Up Campaign began, there have been significant achievements. This is a fact that tells us that if there are other desolate areas where political power cannot penetrate the people and where finances are empty, as long as the Clean-Up Campaign is implemented, it will turn for the better and become fertile areas with considerable tax revenue.</p>
<p>Land Declaration and Measurement</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are no land registers or tax registers in these counties. Saying this, is it possible to put it aside and ignore it? This is not possible. Now, the Clean-Up authorities have ordered the counties to send personnel to measure and report on the land situation by a specific date. The measurement teams are divided into several teams, and each team has Japanese technicians to assist in the measurement. The most advanced measurement work is in Jiaxing and Pinghu. Recently, efforts have been focused on Jiaxing, measuring urban land. The declared area and the measurement results are not much different, with an average difference of about 5%.</p>
<p>Future Issues</p>
<p>After the land is measured, the relationship of the rental of the land will be certainly affected. This area has a special problem, that is, the tendency of renting out a piece of land to multiple tenants. According to the investigation of the Clean-Up Headquarters, a great portion of farmers rent or partially rent the land. The figures in Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Jinshan are as follows:</p>
<p>In average, 81 percent of farmers in Jiaxing and Jiashan work for the landowners. The case is even worse in Jinshan, where 80 percent of the farmers rent the land, 15 percent rent land and work as free labors, and only 5 percent own the land. Although we may not say anything after reading the figures, we feel a sense of urgency of constructing the agricultural issues.</p>
<p>The future important works of the Clean-Up plan are to promote the land measurement, to sort out the tax plan, and to popularize the organization of the cooperative society. Boosting the output and establishing the economy after China joining the war are related to the above issues a great deal, and we all hope to actively construct.</p>
<p>Judging from the farming products in this area, the ratio of output quantity and land is still far from perfect. Even the soil is fertile in Jiaxing and Jiashan, the output per acre is still not great.</p>
<p>The number of farming fields and dry fields is not clear, but compared to the production of rice and the area of fields, the production of rice is not that rich, and other groats and farming products are relatively few. For what reasons? Although we can not fully trust that the figures are certain, the officials shall seriously consider the above reasons that are leading to the insufficieny of production.

<h3 id="e55">One Year of Nanshi Baojia Facilities <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Ying</p>
<p>Baojia is a good current system and is of great importance to local security. Its meticulous and sound organization is related to our well-being and the people's. Not only is it closely related to the city's residents, but it is also linked to the evolution of the entire society. The Bureau was ordered to take over the Nanshi Baojia, and it has been a year since then. In the past year, the police and Baojia have been able to cooperate thoroughly, which has made the security forces in Nanshi more substantial. Therefore, the facilities of Nanshi Baojia in the past year are recorded below for the purpose of reviewing the past and encouraging the future, so that the police-Baojia cooperation in Nanshi will be even closer.</p>
<p>Nanshi Baojia: The Beginning</p>
<p>Since the Incident, Nanshi has suffered terribly from the ravages of war, and local security has been extremely chaotic. After I took charge of the Shanghai police administration, my first priority was to stabilize the local area so that security could be restored as soon as possible and people could live and work in peace. At that time, the Baojia system had not yet been implemented, and the maintenance of security depended entirely on the police. It was not until August of the 28th year of the Republic of China that the Nanshi Political Affairs Office began to implement the Baojia system under the order of the municipal government. This was the beginning of the Nanshi Baojia system. At that time, the entire area was divided into five districts, each with a district office and a district chief. Unfortunately, due to limited funds, the Baojia system could not be fully completed, and only a rough framework was established.</p>
<p>Police-Baojia Cooperation: Preventing Reaction</p>
<p>In January of last year, the Nanshi District Office was ordered to be abolished, and the management of Baojia in the entire district was taken over by the Bureau. At the same time, Zhan Xiyu, who was in charge of the Baojia section of the former Nanshi District Office, was appointed as the Baojia administrator of the Bureau, so that he could easily handle the work and strengthen the Baozhong, which would achieve twice the result with half the effort. The district heads of each district were also familiar with the Baojia situation and were not replaced. Considering the importance of Nanshi, I advocated police-Baojia cooperation in January of last year to eliminate the agitation of reactionary elements, maintain close contact, and work together regardless of each other to jointly maintain the security of the entire region.</p>
<p>Rechecking Household Registration: Handling Pledge</p>
<p>Nanshi is connected to the Concession and is located in an important area, but the household registration changes frequently every month, making it easy for criminals to hide and endanger the local area. After the Bureau took over the Nanshi Baojia, it first ordered a recheck of the household registration in the entire area, which was a basic and necessary measure to strengthen the Baojia in the entire area. After the rechecking of the household registration in the entire area was completed, the Baojia regulations were immediately handled, and a joint guarantee pledge was implemented. However, at that time, due to the limited level of public knowledge, it was quite difficult to promote this work. With the sincere guidance of the Bureau's Baojia administrator, it took three months to complete.</p>
<p>Re-electing District Heads: Entire District</p>
<p>After the implementation of the joint guarantee pledge in the entire Nanshi District, and at the same time, in order to further strengthen the Baojia in Nanshi, the Baojia chiefs set up in the five districts in the entire region were of mixed quality. While most of them were dutiful and law-abiding, some took the opportunity to coerce and exploit the people, which was unavoidable, which would lead to the loss of the purpose of promoting Baojia and maintaining local security. Therefore, in July of the same year, it was decided to re-elect the Baojia chiefs in the entire region. The district offices were immediately ordered to handle the re-election carefully and conscientiously. Within one month, all the Baojia chiefs in the entire district were re-elected. Since then, the Baojia system in Nanshi has gradually been put on the right track.</p>
<p>Preventing Abuses: Badges Must Be Issued</p>
<p>Although the Baojia system in the entire Nanshi District has gradually become meticulous, in order to comply with the regulations, the joint Baojia offices of each district were established. There are a total of 52 districts in the entire district, with one joint Baojia chief, one full-time Bao chief, and one clerk in each office. At the same time, in order to facilitate services, badges, service certificates, and armbands were issued to each Baojia to facilitate identification and prevent abuses. However, the Baojia funds in the entire district are insufficient, and the regular expenses of each district office are extremely difficult. In addition, after the establishment of the joint Baojia chief office, the expenses have become even greater. Therefore, the municipal government has been requested to approve the collection of Baojia funds from January of this year, stipulating that households pay one yuan per month and shops pay two yuan per month. Since then, after the Baojia funds are stipulated, the promotion of Baojia work will be smoother.</p>
<p>Establishing Police Corps: Consolidating the Local Area</p>
<p>The establishment of the police corps in the Nanshi District aims to assist the police, strengthen local security, prevent bandits from moving, and prevent problems before they occur. In addition to ordering the chiefs of the three police stations in Nanshi to be the deputy chiefs of the corps, the district chiefs of each district are the captains, and Wang Delin, the chief of the Yemiao Police Station, is appointed as the chief of the corps to achieve unity. Since its establishment in January of last year, no incidents of terror and unrest have occurred in the entire district, and local security has been consolidated. This cannot but be attributed to the effective cooperation between the police and Baojia.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Various Parties Plan to Leverage Baojia to Promote Public Affairs and Assist the Work of the Hygiene and Fire Departments <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Due to the establishment of the Baojia system, the agencies in this port that handle various local undertakings are planning to leverage this organization to work with residents to jointly promote public affairs.</p>
<p>Supervising at All Times: Paying Attention to Hygiene</p>
<p>According to inquiries, the hygiene departments of the two concessions are actively preparing to use the Baojia system to enable the public hygiene undertakings to have good development. The general method will be to order the heads of each Baojia to manage the cleaning work in their respective areas. They must supervise residents to pay attention to hygiene at all times. When necessary, the hygiene authorities will specifically launch a publicity campaign to order each Baojia chief to inform each household to cooperate in the designated hygiene work.</p>
<p>Self-Policing Assistance: Regulating Traffic</p>
<p>For the maintenance of public traffic regulations, after the safety movement was held by the Youth Department of Baozhong on the 12th of this month, the self-policing officers guarding each post will also be ordered by the authorities to assist the police in supervising pedestrians or vehicles to comply with traffic regulations. However, the method of traffic control by self-policing officers is mainly "persuasion" to ensure that residents are happy to comply.</p>
<p>Joint Supervision: Preventing Fires</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Fire Brigade has been striving for innovation, the training of firefighters and the purchase of new fire-fighting equipment have been actively carried out. However, it is learned that the fire department authorities also have a plan to use the Baojia organization to prevent fires from occurring recently. This plan is probably to enable residents of each household to be led by the Baojia chief to make various preparations for preventing fires and to supervise each other to prevent opportunities for fires to occur. At the same time, in an emergency, each household will be ordered to help put out the fire.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Insurance Contracts Must Be Affixed with Revenue Stamps, Effective Tomorrow <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Insurance Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has issued an order for the implementation of the insurance revenue stamp regulations. Insurance contracts should be affixed with revenue stamps, and the insurance industry should collect the revenue stamp fee from the policyholders and affix them. The amount is 1% of the insurance premium stated on the insurance contract. The Bureau has ordered the matter to be handled. It is now stipulated that from the 10th of this month, all insurance contracts signed in this city must be affixed with revenue stamps. In the future, when policyholders receive insurance contracts, they should pay the revenue stamp fee and check whether the revenue stamps have been affixed and whether they are sufficient. Insurance managers should also check clearly when issuing insurance contracts. If there is any intentional failure to affix revenue stamps or insufficient revenue stamps, it will be handled according to law. If policyholders refuse to pay the revenue stamp fee, the insurance industry may report to the Bureau for severe punishment according to law. In addition to the Bureau's announcement of the above measures, the Insurance Industry Association of this city has also notified its member companies to comply.</p>

<p>This newspaper's student aid fund received assistance from the owner of Lianyin Bookstore, who used birthday celebrations to help students. We are deeply grateful for this care. We also received a donation from students of the Southeast Senior Vocational School's pharmacy department to commemorate Women's Day by collecting donations to help students. It is commendable to do something worth commemorating on a meaningful memorial day. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A letter from the students of Southeast Senior Vocational School said, "Our school's female students, in order to commemorate this year's Women's Day and respond to your museum's student aid fund-raising campaign, specially raised 230 national currency yuan to donate to your museum for student aid. The small amount is just a token of mutual assistance, and we hope that all sectors of society will enthusiastically support it."</p>

<p>In order to save materials, the rubber industry in this city has stipulated that citizens can only purchase overshoes on rainy days and must bring a house tax bill and a corresponding citizen ID card. Although this method has achieved the purpose of restriction since its implementation, the general public still purchases them even if they are not needed, and they are not used after being prepared. This phenomenon is similar to hoarding in disguise. Therefore, the rubber industry has formulated another remedy. In addition to complying with the original method of limiting purchases to rainy days, when purchasing new shoes, old shoes must be brought for exchange. New shoes will not be sold to those who do not bring old shoes. Other documents such as house tax bills and citizen ID cards must still be brought. The old shoes exchanged can still be recycled by the rubber industry.</p>

<p>— Qinglian</p>
<p>(IV) National Liberation Movement</p>
<p>The Burmese people's national independence movement has never stopped since the British established their colonial regime in Burma. Moreover, it is in the process of intensifying.</p>
<p>The non-cooperation movement against the British initiated by Mahatma Gandhi, the leader of the Indian national liberation movement that began in 1920, ignited a national wave of anger against British imperialism throughout India. The National Congress Party gained leadership of the national movement in India. This first Indian national movement, which lasted for two years, gave the Burmese people a strong anti-imperialist consciousness and promoted the Burmese national independence movement.</p>
<p>In 1932, following the international imperialist economic panic, Burmese national independence activists put forward the slogan of breaking away from British shackles and striving for political independence. The tide of the independence movement flooded throughout Burma. The British adopted inhumane repressive measures against them, just as they did against the Indian national liberation movement. However, due to the unexpected spirit of sacrifice of the Burmese national activists and their unwavering persistence in the struggle, the cunning British imperialists were stunned! They had to hurriedly change their colors and set up the so-called Simon Commission to conduct a survey of the political situation in India and Burma. However, this was not a sincere intention to give up privileges in the slightest. It was just a trick to temporarily ease the Burmese people's resistance and have time for further suppression. The Burmese people certainly could not fail to see this, so they "boycotted" the committee on the grounds that "there were no Indian and Burmese people's representatives in the committee." Therefore, the British rulers had to make "greater" concessions, and the Simon case became the center of the London Round Table Conference, which decided to separate India and Burma. — Although, in fact, this was again the beginning of a new deception.</p>
<p>Originally, Britain had reached the point of saturation in treating India as its commodity market. The Indian national liberation movement had also developed to the stage of becoming a fatal pain for Britain. In order to maintain this "crown of the British Empire," they first tried to break the unity of the Indian nation, one of which was to implement the separation of India and Burma. For Burma, on the surface, it seemed to be a "concession," and there was a prospect of "autonomy." In this way, for the Indian national movement, it was to split off a part of the force. Moreover, Britain further used the hatred of the Burmese people towards the Indians caused by the rampant usurious exploitation of Indians in Burma in the past to make the "autonomous" Burma a separate force to contain the Indian national movement. How clever and malicious are the British tactics of dividing and suppressing the anti-imperialist movements in the colonies!</p>
<p>Burma, which was split from India, became a directly governed colony of the British Empire. First, a two-house parliamentary system was established. The parliament was divided into upper and lower houses. The upper house was composed of members appointed by the governor, and as a result, it became an organ for protecting British rights in Burma. The lower house was composed of members elected by the Burmese people themselves, but Indians and British people in Burma also had the right to vote and be elected. The cabinet was composed of ten ministers, but its administrative power did not extend to the Federated Shan States under the jurisdiction of the Governor and the Ministry of National Defense, and the areas under the rule of chieftains in the northwest. Moreover, the cabinet had no say in the expenditure of national defense funds. In other words, the national defense budget was decided by the Ministry of National Defense without the deliberation of the parliament and the cabinet ministers, and the governor had the power to veto the resolutions of the parliament. Therefore, although Burma had the name of parliamentary politics, in reality, the British government still retained extensive powers, and the Burmese people had no real political autonomy.</p>
<p>This hypocritical policy naturally aroused the dissatisfaction of the entire Burmese people with the constitution and fueled the Burmese national independence movement. The light of the new era has long shone on the entire territory of the Buddhist country, and the flames of the national liberation struggle have been burning on both sides of the Irrawaddy River and in the surrounding mountains.</p>
<p>(V) British Exploitation</p>
<p>Britain actually ruled Burma from 1862 (the first year of the Qing Tongzhi reign) after the Second Anglo-Burmese War. The British appointed political officers to rule Lower Burma. This rule continued until the complete annexation in 1897 (the 23rd year of the Guangxu reign), and it was not until 1923 (the 12th year of the Republic of China) that it was officially incorporated into a province of British India, directly under the rule of the Governor-General of India.</p>
<p>The most prominent thing after Burma was annexed was the increase in Indian immigration to Burma. British imperialism used Indians as commercial agents, soldiers, and police, that is, the policy of "using Indians to control Burma," to control the national life of the entire Burma. At the same time, Indians gradually gained the upper hand in Burma and mastered the leadership of Burmese commerce. After the opening of the Suez Canal, Burma gradually became an international market, which promoted the development of Burmese land and brought about a fundamental change in the Burmese economy. First, the rice and other resources produced in Burma were listed as international commodities, and the Indian merchants who were good at business were used to increase the trade profits of British capitalism. Here, the rice-producing areas of Burma also shifted from Upper Burma to Lower Burma. Second, following the development of land, Indian immigrants poured in like a tide. At the same time, the so-called "Chettiar" Indian usurious capital, based in Madras, also penetrated into Burma as land finance, strangling the Burmese farmers.</p>
<p>The status of India and Indians in Burma gradually became an important factor sufficient to dominate Burmese national life. Among the nearly two million Indians, one-third were laborers, and two-thirds were engaged in trade and general commerce. The government offices and transportation agencies were also full of Indians. Among the more than 1,000 Burmese factory workers, Indians accounted for 75%, especially in Rangoon, where Indian laborers accounted for 95% of unskilled workers and 70% of skilled workers. Burmese workers, mainly oil workers, had a lower standard of living and quality compared to Indians. Only in Upper Burma was the original state of Burma still preserved to some extent. Most of the automobile transportation industry, household industry, printing industry, etc., were still engaged in by Burmese people. In recent years, due to the opening of the Burma Road, the power of overseas Chinese has also increased in Upper Burma.</p>
<p>The usurious capital that cruelly exploited the vast majority of Burmese residents—80% of farmers—was everywhere, with its blood-sucking cell network covering almost every inch of land and every Burmese person. They lent money to Burmese farmers during the busy farming season to collect high interest rates. If the farmers were unable to repay, they would confiscate their land. Due to the stimulation of land confiscation, the price of rice plummeted in 1930. According to statistics at that time, the amount of financing provided by "Chettiar" to land was more than 500 million rupees, accounting for two-thirds of the total financing amount of 750 million rupees in Burma. As a result, the self-cultivating farmers' land in Lower Burma, which was 72.1% in 1928, decreased to 54.2% in 1930; the self-cultivating farmers' land in Upper Burma decreased from 90% to 86.3%. Usurious capital swept away the land of Burmese self-cultivating farmers, causing a panic in Burmese agriculture.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the independence movement, Britain allowed Burma to implement autonomy in 1937 and was no longer a province of India. It used political deception and military superiority to consolidate its exploitation and plunder in Burma.</p>
<p>The most important resource of Burma, the petroleum industry, was founded in 1886 (the 12th year of the Qing Guangxu reign) and was exclusively occupied by the Burma Oil Company (capital of 18.5 million pounds), which maintained close relations with the British government. Its lead, silver, zinc, tin, etc. were also controlled by the Burma Chamber of Commerce with strong British power as its background. The logging of forests and the sale of rice, etc., were also monopolized by the Steel Brothers Trading Company, which was composed of British capital, and the Bombay Burma Trading Corporation, which was also a British company. The rice milling industry was also the largest under British management. Although there were only 45 out of the 640 rice mills in Burma, the number of workers they employed reached 20,000; the 300 rice mills operated by Burmese people employed only 10,000 workers; the 150 rice mills operated by Indians and overseas Chinese employed about 5,000 workers each. Therefore, from whatever angle, British capital was firmly the center of the Burmese economy, monopolizing the main sectors of rice milling, mining, and forestry. British people in Burma occupied the most important positions in Burmese politics, economy, and military, either as high officials and soldiers, or as big businessmen and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>According to a report by British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler in the House of Commons in 1937, British investment in Burma was 60 million to 70 million pounds, and Indians invested 70 million rupees (equivalent to 5.25 million pounds). It can be seen that British investment in Burma also accounted for an overwhelming majority. Therefore, we can say that before the Greater East Asia War, although the political position had begun to waver, the British economic superiority in Burma was still deeply rooted.</p>
<p>(VI) Overseas Chinese in Burma</p>
<p>Burma and China have had relations for at least a thousand years. From the perspective of ethnic distribution, from the perspective of economic structure and production methods, and from the perspective of geographical and cultural relations, the relationship between China and Burma is very close. In fact, a history of Burma, especially the cultural history of Burma, cannot be separated from China and India. In particular, the Chinese people and the native Burmese people have generally been the most friendly and loving nations in the past, and no one has the ambition to invade. Among the overseas Chinese in Burma, the compatriots from Yunnan, Fujian, and Guangdong are the most numerous. The most important occupations are small business and handicrafts, and there are also many farmers. Most of the workers in mining are also overseas Chinese, most of whom come from Yunnan. Because the overseas Chinese have absolutely no political ambitions, and have always stood on the side of the oppressed nations in resisting British imperialism, sympathizing with and aiding the Burmese national independence movement, they have a general and genuine good impression in Burma.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Women's Circles Held Yesterday: March 8th Commemorative Meeting - Proceeds from Paper Flower Charity Sale Entirely for Relief of Poor Women <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was March 8th, Women's Day. The Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association specially held a city-wide women's commemorative meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium in Tianhougong Bridge at 10:00 AM. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendance from Various Quarters</p>
<p>The venue was set up in the auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce. A long red banner with the words "General Assembly Title" was hung high at the entrance, flanked by two national flags. The platform in the meeting hall was decorated with a high colorful dais, with various colored silk curtains crossed. Colorful slogans were posted all over the walls. Government officials and guests attending included Mayor Chen Gongbo, his wife, and Minister of Social Welfare Ding Mocun, as well as Zhang Kechang, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Social Welfare, and Luo Shouzhang, Yu Yaoqiu, Chen Dongbai, etc. Hu Shouqi and Liu Qimin, secretaries and directors of the Municipal Bureau of Social Welfare, Principal Zhao Zhengping, Wu Jiyu representing Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce, and representatives from the City Women's Association, the Chinese Women's Progressive Association, the Chinese Young Women's Christian Association, the City Women's Welfare Association, and friendly foreign women's groups, including Tokuda Aziko of the East Asian Women's Association and Ota Asako of the Shanghai Situation Women's Association, totaled no less than four hundred people.</p>
<p>Flower Sale Results</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association, in order to relieve poor women, launched a paper flower charity sale on the 7th of this month. Fifty teams were organized by the city's girl scouts to go to various important intersections, movie theaters, tea houses, coffee shops, parks, and other entertainment venues in the city to solicit donations. With the assistance of various parties, over 7,000 paper flowers were sold throughout the day. Before the commencement of yesterday morning's assembly, the donations were unsealed in public under the supervision of Social Welfare Minister Ding Mocun. After sorting, Miss Huang Yunping achieved the highest donation collection. The total donations collected throughout the day amounted to 12,081.90 National Currency yuan and 31.83 Military Scrip yuan. The Women's Association will allocate these funds to women and children relief organizations after the meeting to support this charitable cause.</p>
<p>Madam Chen's Speech</p>
<p>The original text of Mayor Chen's wife's speech at the Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association is as follows: "Distinguished guests, sisters, I am very happy and gratified to be here today to participate in this International Women's Day and receive your guidance. However, amidst this happiness and gratification, a few thoughts arise, which I would like to share with you for your reference. I welcome your guidance if there is anything inappropriate.</p>
<p>Firstly, regarding the history of International Women's Day and the status of international women, I believe that all compatriots attending this conference today are aware, so there is no need for me to elaborate in this short time. What I want to talk about now is the issue of Chinese women's knowledge and morality. I advocate that Chinese women's knowledge should catch up and increase day by day. With sufficient new knowledge, we can shoulder the epoch-making mission of today's New China. However, in terms of morality, we must not be overly left-leaning. In other words, thoughts should be new, and morality should be old. This is the viewpoint I have held throughout my life. As the ancients said, 'If one is not upright, one's orders will not be followed.' I have been deeply influenced by this educational thought. Therefore, I believe that the starting point of morality is nothing more than the four virtues of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame.</p>
<p>Secondly, I advocate that women should engage in education and charitable work. I feel that women's physiology, psychology, and temperament are all different from men's. This is natural and difficult to change. Because of these differences, our women's work does not necessarily have to be the same as men's. For example, now that the Greater East Asia War is expanding, do we women have to go to the front lines with the soldiers to be considered patriotic and to have fulfilled our responsibilities? No, I believe that it is more important for us to assist the soldiers in the rear. I have already discussed this principle in my article 'My Family Life' published in the Women's Asahi Shimbun. I also feel that women's nature is biased towards emotion, which is a good thing for women. If she is biased towards reason and lacks emotion, she cannot maintain the family and raise children. In short, women's physiology, psychology, and temperament are all suitable for engaging in education and charitable work, especially the important responsibility of family education, which must be borne by women. Without good family education, relying solely on school education cannot achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I do not advocate women's participation in politics. I have observed that women's nature is biased towards emotion and does not emphasize reason. However, political issues concern the major policies of the country, where every reform and appointment of personnel directly affects the country's lifeline. Even a slight carelessness can lead to the loss of sovereignty and humiliation. The ancients said, 'One word can make a country prosper, and one word can make a country perish.' Looking back at the past and present, how many women have participated in politics? The past is to the present as the present is to the past. We should know when to advance and when to retreat. Furthermore, women should not participate in politics until their abilities and knowledge are sufficient. Even if they have sufficient knowledge and abilities, they should still use their own skills. If they only rely on their background and attach themselves to the power of others to dabble in politics and argue for the sake of argument, it will not only harm the country and society but may even lead to disgrace and ruin, leaving no room for regret. I hope that Chinese women will have a clear understanding of this point and not act rashly.</p>
<p>Fourthly, I support women in promoting proper entertainment, first and foremost by cherishing and loving themselves. As the saying goes, 'Poverty and meanness cannot corrupt, wealth and honor cannot move, and power and force cannot subdue.' This is called womanhood. At all times, we must intensify our own work. After finishing our work, we should promote proper entertainment, because proper entertainment not only makes ourselves feel happy physically and mentally, but also allows us to appreciate our friends and influence our families. I believe that human nature is 'similar at birth.' When we enter a good environment, evil people gradually become good. When we enter a bad environment, good people also gradually become evil. This is the principle of 'similar at birth, but different through habit.' I hope everyone pays attention.</p>
<p>I have spoken for too long. Now, to summarize, I hope that all women will muster their spirits and do their jobs well. Then, the epoch-making New China will naturally prosper, and we will feel at ease and will not have spent today's Women's Day in vain. Let us work together."</p>
<p>Yesterday's commemorative event was very enthusiastic. The presidium of the assembly also sent a respectful telegram to Chairman Wang and Central Committee Member Chen Bijun to pay their respects.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Japanese Staff Officer Talks About the Recent Situation in Guangzhou Bay <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>A staff officer of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, who participated in the landing in Guangzhou Bay last month and negotiated with the French Chief Administrator of the Guangzhou Bay Leased Territory, Tremanck, on the peaceful entry, has recently returned to Shanghai. According to him, the operation initially caused great agitation among the residents, but the non-interference policy towards the French administration stabilized the people's hearts, and the area has now recovered its past prosperity. The French administrative organs in Guangzhou Bay, from the Chief Administrator down to the department heads and the police captain, consist of only three people. Three hundred Guangdong people and one hundred Annamese are responsible for security. The population consists of over 230,000 Li and Guangdong people, while there are only sixty French people. The staff officer continued that the soil in the area is clay and sandy, making it unsuitable for agriculture. Most of the food supply depends on imports from the mainland. Therefore, during the entry, although the outer areas were strictly guarded, the inflow of materials was allowed freely, so there was no shortage of food or other unrest. However, due to the impact of high prices in non-peaceful areas, prices have risen sharply. A pack of ten cigarettes sells for twenty yuan. The French authorities are currently seeking countermeasures.</p>

<p>Since Chairman Wang of the National Government resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, national morale has been high, and the significance of China's participation in the war has been deeply understood. The Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, in order to arouse the public's commemoration of China's participation in the war, has published an advertisement offering a cash prize for lyrics for the Chinese Participation in the War Commemorative March. The theme must be profound and the wording concise, with simplicity and popularity as the main focus. The best works, after passing the review, will be awarded a prize of 500 yuan in currency for the first place, 200 yuan for the second place, and 100 yuan for the third place. The submission period is from now until March 25th. Entrants must write clearly in ink or pen, affix their name stamp, and indicate their detailed address. Submissions must be sent to No. 15 Jisi Feier Road before the deadline. Once all reviews are completed, a date will be set, and a special letter will be sent to notify the winners, and the results will be published in various newspapers.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Sino-Japanese Women's Forum <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Welfare Association, in view of the past failure of thorough cooperation between Chinese and Japanese women, held the first Sino-Japanese Women's Forum at the Dakele Cafe on Nanjing Road at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 8th), which was Women's Day. Over a hundred people, including Mayor Chen's wife, attended and proposed various cooperation plans. Later, Zhao Wenyi, the president of the association, reported on the general situation of the association's work as follows: (1) Continue to hold Sino-Japanese Women's Forums every month, scheduled for the second Sunday afternoon of each month at 2:00 PM at the Xinya Restaurant on Nanjing Road.

<h3 id="e70">Shanghai Cultural Circles Today <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Yirang</p>
<p>For this issue of the Shen Bao Monthly, we solicited articles on the theme of "Shanghai Cultural Circles Today," and we received enthusiastic submissions from readers. Due to the limited space in the monthly, we were unable to include all of them, so we have selected a few to be reprinted in this newspaper. — Editor's Note</p>
<p>According to the original meaning of the word "culture," it is indeed quite broad and complex—but here we can only narrow the scope to refer to so-called "publications," that is, the literary aspect of "writing on bamboo and silk."</p>
<p>On the surface, "culture" seems to be an abstract term, but in practice, the germination and development of culture must be closely coordinated with material conditions; in particular, political and economic gains and losses are the most important factors determining the rise and fall of culture. Reasoning from this, the reason why the cultural circles in Shanghai were once so desolate and barren is probably no more than the fact that the political situation at that time had not yet improved. Using a more refined analogy, the "literary garden" at that time was like a wilderness a few months ago: everywhere was withered and desolate.</p>
<p>However, as the times changed, so did human affairs, and looking back at the "turning point" of the Shanghai cultural circles, it seems that it began after the return to the capital. Following this, various facilities and organizations gradually got on track, and in the cultural circles, there were also signs of recovery. Thus, there was vigor, and thus there was enthusiasm, even if it was not entirely satisfactory, it was not entirely unsatisfactory, and compared with the past mess, today's vigor was more obvious.</p>
<p>As for "Shanghai Cultural Circles Today," a common saying can be used to describe it: good and bad are mixed. In other words, there are also publications that maintain a rigorous attitude and a good standard. I happen to have a few recently published periodicals on hand, such as "Cosmos," "Ancient and Modern," and "The Magazine." Here, I will take "Ancient and Modern," which has been published for more than a year, as a concrete example.</p>
<p>The president of "Ancient and Modern" is Zhu Puzhi. Although he has held many important positions in the party and government, his interest is inclined towards cultural undertakings. And the rise of "Ancient and Modern" was also during the autumn of the cultural circles at that time. According to its inaugural statement, it was "wanting to do something that we think we can barely manage to do at this time when the publishing world is extremely silent." This is indeed a fact: and it can also be said that it has opened up this revival of the publishing atmosphere, and it is a praiseworthy achievement. Unlike the "Cosmos" monthly and other publications before it, it has been able to overcome various difficulties and restrictions and has continued to support itself to this day, and it has also maintained an appropriate standard. This spirit is also admirable. As for the rigor of the material selection of "Ancient and Modern" and the uniqueness of its style, in the current situation of scattered writers and empty themes, it must be said to be extremely rare. In particular, several articles by famous people can make self-criticisms on their personal lives, experiences, and personalities, which makes people feel more intimate and interesting—speaking of articles by famous people, if they are not written by highly skilled artists, they often have a defect: either they are shallow and perfunctory, or they are dry and didactic. But as far as the articles published in "Ancient and Modern" are concerned, the author's sincerity and feelings are engraved between the lines! "Seeing the big from the small," it allows readers to see their shadows and glimpse their minds, their spirit, and their talent, and naturally inspires admiration and encouragement after reading. Compared with deliberately made maxims and creeds, its effect is not the same. As for other works, although not every article is worth reading, seven or eight out of ten still have a value to read. In short, regardless of the distance in the degree of appreciation due to the reader's interest and preferences, the serious working attitude of the editors and the high standard are consistent impressions. Although some people may say that it is just moving antiques and retelling old stories, but at this time and in this place, it should be looked at differently to examine, explore, and promote meaningful historical materials, anecdotes, and admirable figures, right? In addition, "The Magazine" monthly, which belongs to the New China newspaper system, although it feels a bit too "miscellaneous" in a few places, is still worthy of the word "solid" on the whole.</p>
<p>This is one of the more hardworking groups in the Shanghai cultural circles today.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, there are many things that make people feel uncomfortable, and I just want to fulfill my humble duty to speak out, that is, the goals and attitudes of some cultural people's activities, which I think must be corrected and reflected upon. Due to the limitations of the current real conditions, it is true that there are many things that cannot be done, but it is also an undeniable shortcoming that some people in the cultural circles do not make serious and conscientious efforts in their subjective aspects—especially when paper merchants are adding fuel to the fire, if we run one more boring publication or write one more boring article, it is tantamount to increasing unnecessary consumption and meaningless waste for the country. What's more, cultural people and paper are originally tools that depend on each other, and they should have extra care and cherishing.</p>
<p>But naturally, such a statement is inevitably problematic. Because the boundary between so-called boring and "interesting" is where, and how is its standard chosen? Is it that besides the great articles of "managing the country and making the fields wild," everything else is not worth mentioning?</p>
<p>Indeed, the distinction between these two makes the responder quite hesitant. However, although the rights and wrongs of the world are said to be inconsistent, if we can decide based on the likes and dislikes of the majority of people, it will probably not be far off. One example is: when a publication is sent to the vast number of readers, at least one characteristic can be seen, that is, the editor's seriousness and carelessness, rigor and perfunctoriness. Like some publications—fortunately, they are still a minority—we can tell at a glance that they are full of gimmicks and business acumen, and they are blindly catering to the tastes of vulgar readers.</p>
<p>But naturally, we will never shout high-sounding slogans about how to "advance" or be "righteous." In the current situation, with the perseverance and money to run a "cultural undertaking," it seems to have become a matter of course that publishers cannot ignore "business acumen." However, I also think that even so, we still have to have a sense of proportion and moderation. When we talk, it seems that everyone can say a set of beautiful sentences about "culture" and "spiritual food," which are grand and upright, and can be written with a stroke of the pen. Therefore, when we really do it one day, we must also consider the practical effect of "culture" to some extent. Even in terms of "business acumen," we should also consider the cost of the "patrons" and readers to some extent, so that they can take back a little real food and add a little good nutrition, and not just circle around the readers' turbid tastes. We should maintain a little dignity and purity for culture. When drinking water, remember the source, we are ultimately cultural people!</p>
<p>But today, making this kind of "inopportune" argument will inevitably be laughed at as "the opinion of a bookworm." For example, many shortsighted people, seeing some phenomena of political corruption and overbearing, and the atmosphere of commercial speculation and manipulation, are all surrounded by the mentality of getting by and living a drunken life, so some wriggling people in the cultural circles first feel "envious," which is not enough, and then they feel "itchy." The reason is: anyway, everyone is doing this, why not fish in troubled waters! In this way, all kinds of fragrant, soft, and seductive pornographic literature have emerged under this mentality. But we still have to think rationally: the country and society, after all, have higher expectations and more preferential treatment for cultural people. Therefore, our mission and task cannot be compared with those of corruption and speculation. We don't have to complain about others not paying attention, as long as we do it rigorously, our spirit will definitely have a noble and respectable harvest, and the vast number of readers will definitely stand on the side of the rigorous workers! Let us listen to the words of those cultural people who are struggling to stay in Paris: "Their conscience tells them to stay in their wounded motherland." Today's cultural people in Shanghai, if they really want to contribute some sweat and ink for "the wounded motherland," then please set foot on the suffering land and do something practical, and at least, don't create cultural toxins anymore.</p>
<p>Secondly, in addition to the above-mentioned pornographic literature taking the opportunity to stir up trouble, that is, some more pure publications, in terms of quality, are still weak and uncoordinated, and besides the "Ancient and Modern" mentioned above, which can stand alone and form a unique style, there are very few, otherwise, its sales will be limited. Therefore, publishers and editors have to adopt a variety of strategies. After reading them, it can be said that everything is available, and there is nothing that is not strange; because most writers are scattered, those who remain in Shanghai feel few, and these "few" have either changed careers or put down their pens. Therefore, when we open a newly published periodical, we feel more and more monotonous and dull. And among these writers, due to the instability of life, the emptiness of materials, and the confusion of mind, it is difficult to get outstanding works. At the same time, the situation in terms of single-volume books seems even more desolate. For example, the Commercial Press, which used to be called "one book a day," has hardly published half a book in the past year or so! It cannot but be said to be a great regret that such a representative of China's largest cultural institution is living such a cold life. As for other publishing institutions below it, it is not necessary to say more. This is of course a long story, but the biggest reason is the surging price of paper. Zuo Si of the Jin Dynasty wrote the "Three Capitals Rhapsody," and there is a saying that "the paper in Luoyang is expensive," which was a compliment at that time, but it is a sharp satire now! On this point, we sincerely hope that the relevant authorities can make a grand plan as soon as possible, and should reasonably control it like other daily necessities. Then, further, for a small number of boring and vulgar publications and newspapers, whether it is elimination or merger, in short, there must be a way to regulate and distribute evenly, so that we can "take from the surplus to make up for the deficiency."</p>
<p>Finally, there should also be some subsidies and rewards for some cultural people who are truly buried in hard work and are poor and lonely. Although the "selling articles for a living" literati in today's world are not selling articles to die, but with their inherently weak bodies, dealing with such high prices is undoubtedly approaching "death"! And how can we expect the emergence of "great works"? And how can we stop them from lamenting poverty and complaining? Like some of the literati who have changed their ways, it is because their writing income is not enough to support a family of eight, but for the sake of the entire culture, it is a serious loss.</p>
<p>"Governing is not in many words, but in how to implement it"? At this time of storms and darkness, whether it is in charge of the country's politics or in charge of the pen's politics, we must keep these two sentences in mind. Then we must encourage each other and raise each other up to make the cockcrow in the faint dawn, breaking the desolate literary garden, and then waking up a corner of the East!</p>

<p>Economic Circles</p>
<h3 id="e71">On the National Government's New Economic Policy <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>During a meeting held by the Supreme National Defense Council on March 5th, a proposal was passed regarding Minister of Industry Mei Siping's plan for the government to implement control over essential materials and manage and stabilize commodity prices. This proposal includes an important decree, which states that industrial and commercial organizations should be purely economic entities and should not participate in political movements. At first glance, this point may seem like a minor detail, but in reality, any government, in order to maintain public interest, should never use political power for commercial operations. As far as we know, the National Government already has statutory provisions prohibiting officials from engaging in commercial activities, which is the same idea.</p>
<p>According to national laws, government personnel or members of society should either be officials or merchants, and should not simultaneously be both officials and merchants. This is because in any situation, whether in peacetime or wartime, a person who is simultaneously active in both official and commercial circles cannot act in the best interests of the public. The result will inevitably be political corruption, which is contrary to the government's goal of protecting the public interest. Conversely, members of society, due to their own positions, should not be allowed to participate in political activities. This is a regulation that exists in various countries around the world. Therefore, Minister Mei's proposal should be supported by the entire public, as it is not only a characteristic of Nanjing's new economic policy but also a prerequisite for promoting public interest.</p>
<p>Secondly, Minister Mei's original proposal recognizes a close relationship between the prices of goods and the supply and demand of goods. From this, it is known that the price of manufactured goods is tied to the price of raw materials. Therefore, the relationship between the supply and demand of goods is of utmost importance, and strengthening wartime economic power is the central point of Minister Mei's entire proposal.

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e72">Further Discussion on Strengthening Trade Associations <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Trade associations are important organizations in the private economy and should be given power and full authority to exercise their functions and assist the government in implementing wartime economic policies. On the 5th of this month, the National Defense Council, in order to implement government control over essential materials and manage and stabilize commodity prices, stipulated that industrial and commercial organizations should be purely economic entities so that they can concentrate on assisting the government in implementing various economic policies. The original proposal stated that stabilizing people's livelihoods and strengthening economic power are the primary urgent tasks for the government's administration under the wartime system. Now, the government should implement control over essential materials to adjust and rationalize production, distribution, and consumption. Regarding commodity prices and the supply and demand of goods, there is a close relationship between them, and management should also be implemented simultaneously to prevent speculation and hoarding, which would make it difficult to suppress prices. All kinds of industrial and commercial organizations are the main bodies for implementing commodity control and maintaining price equilibrium. Therefore, they should be designated as purely economic institutions. In the future, any political movements and training should be aimed at the Baojia system and should no longer be conducted within the scope of industrial and commercial organizations. This is to ensure the sound organization of industrial and commercial organizations, which will be conducive to the implementation of commodity control and price stabilization policies.</p>
<p>This regulation can not only correct the past shortcomings of industrial and commercial organizations, which only knew how to entertain officials and engage in meetings and speeches, but also strengthen the basic work within the scope of the industrial and commercial organizations themselves. The basic organization of industrial and commercial organizations is the trade association, with the chamber of commerce as its overall body. In the past, trade associations often had only a nominal existence without any practical substance, and were already equivalent to a ceremonial sheep offered without substance. With this kind of powerless and incompetent trade association, wanting it to cope with the extremely important wartime economic policy would be obviously ineffective. Now, by giving it full authority and increasing its power, allowing it to focus on the production, distribution, and adjustment of consumption of materials without involving political movements, it will be able to devote its full efforts to rationalizing the prices of materials and the supply and demand, thereby clarifying the individual's position and fulfilling the government's expectations.</p>
<p>However, in order for it to exert its power, all factories and firms should be forced to join the trade association, so that they have an absolute obligation to obey, and they must never resist the power of the trade association. In the future, the purchase of goods, the shipment of goods, the purchase of materials, manufacturing, and all kinds of facilities among the same industry can only be carried out under unified control and absolute compliance. Once the prices of goods are set, they must never be violated or increased or decreased privately. The association can adopt the method of joint commitment, with several families as a group, and each group provides mutual guarantee, and inspections are intensified from time to time. If violations are discovered, severe punishments will be immediately imposed. In this way, the trade association will have heavier responsibilities and more complicated work, and of course, it will have no time for activities outside its own business. Taking the Chinese stock industry as an example, if a trade association had been organized earlier, giving the industry a scope and conducting spot transactions within the framework, with normal business as the principle, and buying and selling within the regulations, how could there be so many problems from time to time, so that the industry is often in panic and fluctuating, spending its years. It can be seen that strengthening the trade association can not only assist the government in implementing economic strategies, but also, for the sake of the industry itself, it is sufficient to plan the safety of business and seek the stability of transactions. For both the public and private sectors, it is a win-win situation.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Chinese Stock Industry Held Temporary Meeting Yesterday to Select Fifteen People as a Temporary Delegation to Discuss Resumption of Business with Relevant Authorities <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Since the Chinese stock market suspended trading, the authorities have already stipulated registration methods for Chinese stock firms. In the future, any Chinese stock firms that are legally registered and approved and have a license to operate stock trading will be considered legal. Therefore, all stock companies are currently going through the procedures to prepare for resumption of business. However, before the official resumption of business, some companies, considering that the industry does not yet have a trade association, face many obstacles in promoting their business. Therefore, Yongchang, Xingye, Lemao and 26 other stock companies jointly invited the industry in the city to gather at Xinghualou on Simalu at 2 pm yesterday. They discussed ways to organize a trade association, and at the same time, the resumption of the Chinese stock market was the focus of discussion. The details of yesterday afternoon's meeting are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Attending</p>
<p>It is estimated that there are no less than one or two hundred firms in this city that engage in the trading of Chinese stocks, so-called stock companies. However, due to the lack of organization, the industry has been very disorganized. Although there was news of forming a trade association once in August and September of last year, it unfortunately ended in failure. This gathering of the industry had a total of 131 representatives attending, including Liangji, Yongchang, and Xingye. The scale can be described as unprecedented in the history of the industry. The Special High Section of the Public Works Department also sent Qian Shuntang to the scene to monitor the meeting.</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>The initial initiators of this meeting were a small number of enthusiastic members of the industry, such as Yu Mingshi of Xingye Stock Company, Zhang Yilin of Guotai Stock Company, and Zhou Lundi of Huashang Stock Company. It is said that an informal meeting in the form of a prototype had been convened once before, and it was decided on the spot that the 29 stock companies attending the meeting, including Xingye and Lemao, would jointly issue a letter to invite the entire industry to hold a temporary gathering, and at the same time notify the competent authorities to send personnel to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>Motivation for the Meeting</p>
<p>Yu Mingshi was publicly elected as the temporary chairman of the meeting. Then, Zhang Yilin and Zhou Lundi separately stated the purpose and process of preparing for and inviting the entire industry to the meeting. Zhang and Zhou emphasized the importance of the Chinese stock business in the entire commerce and finance, and then frankly admitted that "in the past, the industry's operation of Chinese stock trading may have had errors in procedures, at least the competent authorities have considered that there must be errors." Therefore, in order to break the current serious and depressing stalemate, and to seek instructions from the relevant authorities on a legal way to operate Chinese stocks as soon as possible, the motivation for yesterday's first meeting was formed.</p>
<p>Glimpse of the Topics</p>
<p>The focus of the meeting's discussion was almost entirely on the point of sending a delegation to seek a solution to the resumption of business. Although some people also advocated the immediate establishment of a permanent organization similar to a trade association, the majority of opinions seemed to focus more on clarifying the current stalemate. Therefore, the only decision at the end was to elect 15 industry representatives to form a "Temporary Delegation of the Chinese Stock Industry," which was authorized by the general meeting to contact the relevant authorities to find out how to resume normal operations in order to comply with the government authorities' intention to control commodity prices and other laws.</p>
<p>Elected Representatives</p>
<p>Following the election of the delegation, the fifteen elected representatives are as follows: Zhang Xiaoxian, Zhou Lundi, Yu Mingshi, Yin Wenzhao, Zhao Tiezhang, Zhang Yilin, Ma Weiyuan, Sun Wencheng, Han Jixiang, Lu Junfu, Shen Zhangfu, Yao Zhaotang, Wang Dunfu, Jin Songgan, Zheng Xuegao.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Decides on Prudent Lending Principles <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Following the Ministry's order to prevent speculation and hoarding and suppress commodity prices, the Shanghai Banking Association Preparatory Committee and the Money Industry Joint Reserve have implemented tight restrictions on interbank lending among members. All banks and money shops have decided on the following principles for all lending, including mortgages, credit, and overdrafts: (1) Mortgage loans: Extreme caution should be exercised when providing loans secured by goods. Loans related to daily necessities for people's livelihoods should be refused. Those that have already been made should be redeemed within a specified period and should absolutely not be extended. Applications for mortgages from legitimate merchants in various industries must guarantee that the goods they hold are not for speculation and profiteering, and are limited to the goods of their respective industries. For example, the cotton cloth industry is only allowed to use the cotton cloth it operates as collateral, and no loans can be made with other commodities as collateral. The industrial and commercial firms applying for loans must be members of the industry association, and the term shall not exceed two months at most, and the purpose of the loan must be stated. After the loan has been approved after examination, the lending bank or money shop has the right to immediately recover the loan if it finds that the use of the loan is improper. (2) Credit loans: The term is six months, and according to the usual practice, it is divided into four draws, ten draws, and two installments. However, from now on, special care should be taken to tighten them, and they should be limited to old customers with good credit and those engaged in production. (3) There must be a reliable guarantor responsible for repaying the principal and interest. Short-term credit loans are handled at the discretion of the banks and money shops, and the maximum amount of the loan is limited depending on the business situation of the borrower. Regarding overdrafts, they are handled according to the original overdraft amount, and it is absolutely not allowed to exceed the overdraft amount. As for companies and firms that do not produce, they will be stopped altogether, as they may use credit loans and overdraft funds to speculate and manipulate market prices, as well as hoard goods and raise prices for profit. It is said that after the banks and money shops implemented the above restrictions, speculative merchants who use loan funds from banks and money shops will inevitably suffer a great blow. This move will help curb speculation, hoarding, and price fluctuations, so that legitimate merchants can legally operate their businesses.</p>

<p>Recently, new banks have been established in this city like mushrooms after rain. In addition to those that have officially opened, there are still 23 that have held inaugural meetings but have not yet officially opened. The names of the banks, the amount of capital, the date of the inaugural meeting, and the address or telephone number are listed below.

<p>In order to absorb floating capital in the market and maintain the value of reserve certificates, the Central Reserve Bank plans to revise its deposit interest rates in the shortest possible time. The bank's deposit interest rate is currently one fen per week, while the general Chinese banks in the city are above two fen. Therefore, the total amount of deposits in the bank is decreasing day by day. The degree of future increase is expected to be around two fen. In addition, the interest rate of the Central Reserve Bank is similar to that of the six Japanese banks, and this matter must be agreed upon with the Japanese banks before it can be formally decided.</p>

<p>The flat-priced soybeans of the Shanghai Grain and Sundries Group began to be shipped on the 6th, and the extraction continued yesterday. It is said that those who went to ship the goods in two days included 207 packages from the French Concession, totaling 1,071 packages, 43 from Zhabei, totaling 223 packages, and 236 from Nanshi, totaling 1,160 packages. There are also areas in the Public Concession and Hongkou in West Shanghai that will pick up the goods in the near future. As for the request for allocation from the Pudong tofu industry, it has been approved. However, it is worth noting whether the retail stores sell these soybeans at flat prices.</p>

<p>Chile Controls Excessive Profits</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, March 7th, Havas News Agency - The Chilean government recently submitted a bill to Congress proposing to control excessive profits in industry and commerce. Any company whose profits exceed 15% of the company's capital must set aside a certain amount. 40% of this additional profit must be used to increase work efficiency, and the remaining 60% must be invested in special bonds issued by public economic associations. These bonds are guaranteed by the state with an interest rate of 3% to 5%.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Chilean government requested Congress to set price limits for all raw materials, daily necessities, rent, and wages, based on the price limits implemented on December 1, 1942. The proposal also gives the president broad powers to decide on economic controls, as well as wages and working hours.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Adjustment of Exchange Rate Between North and Central China, Specific Methods to Be Established Soon <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>When Mr. Wang Shijing, President of the North China United Bank, came to Shanghai earlier, he planned to promote the exchange of goods between North and Central China in financial work, and discussed various plans with the relevant parties here on this issue. As a result, all parties agreed that adjusting the exchange rate was the most appropriate method. As for the specific methods for adjusting the exchange rate, they can be established soon. This matter is of great importance to the exchange of goods, so all parties are paying close attention. Since the new year, prices in North China have fluctuated sharply due to restrictions on the movement of goods. At the same time, the financial policies in Central China have also changed due to the preparation of purchasing institutions for goods in the inland and the implementation of loan restrictions. Under the conditions of this basic situation that is about to change, a new plan for adjusting the exchange rate between the United Note and the Reserve Certificate will be implemented. (According to the trade of imports and exports between North and Central China, the United Note and the Reserve Certificate cannot be directly exchanged, but must be indirectly exchanged through special yuan. This new plan is related to the chained exchange rate of the special yuan in North China and the trade between North and Central China in the future, and the rise and fall of the United Note will also have an impact.)</p>

<h3 id="e82">A Humble Opinion on Production Organizations <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Xixian</p>
<p>"Floating capital" is capital that is detached. Capital is one of the essential elements of production. Floating capital, however, is capital that has strayed from its fundamental role in production and entered the realm of consumption. Therefore, floating capital is a burden on society even in times of peace, and its harmful effects are even more pronounced during wartime.</p>
<p>In recent years, as the flames of war have spread across the globe, various unique wartime phenomena such as social unrest, insufficient production, and currency devaluation have caused the owners of floating capital to feel uneasy. For their own survival, they seize their floating capital and seek an outlet, disregarding laws, morality, and the safety of the nation and society. Driven by selfish motives, they exploit every opportunity to seek profit. Furthermore, as the war expands and social unrest increases, businesses find it impossible to operate. Entrepreneurs take their capital and relocate to safe havens, where floating capital congregates and wreaks even more havoc. Thus, although floating capital is driven by selfishness, its ultimate goal is simply to find a safe haven.</p>
<p>Shanghai, as an international metropolis, has temporarily become a gathering place for floating capital. Unofficial estimates from banks suggest that the amount is alarmingly large. To find a way out, this massive amount of floating capital engages in currency speculation and hoarding of goods. At the same time, production sharply declines and currency values plummet, creating an opportune moment for unscrupulous operators to amass wealth from the nation's crisis. Thus, the cart is put before the horse, and it is believed that all business operations are not as profitable as engaging in speculation and hoarding, which can yield easy profits. What owner of floating capital would be willing to bury themselves in investing in and operating a production enterprise, hoping for long-term gains?</p>
<p>In the context of private capital today, the freedom of trade is undeniably justifiable. However, during extraordinary times of war, such behavior is akin to causing disruption in the rear. The authorities are actively cracking down on such activities. Recently, the authorities have taken the following measures to address the problems caused by floating capital: (1) cracking down on speculation involving short selling and buying, as well as hoarding; (2) restricting collateral loans; (3) raising interbank lending rates; (4) encouraging investment in rural areas.</p>
<p>Other proposals include establishing prize-winning lottery tickets and setting up savings departments in banks and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Based on the above observations, the fundamental solution to the problem of floating capital ultimately lies in economic principles. Since capital is an essential element of production, we must return to the foundation of production and guide it back to its origin, just as diverting the Huai and Yellow Rivers leads them back to the sea. Our recommendations are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The government should authorize a state-owned enterprise or establish a special department to formulate a comprehensive economic construction plan, such as a three-year or five-year plan. Regarding various production sectors such as textiles, milling, afforestation, land reclamation, and animal husbandry, each sector should be classified as essential or secondary according to its nature, and the plan should be implemented accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) The government should issue a large-scale economic construction bond, with an amount of 300 billion or 500 billion, with an interest rate of 8%. The funds raised from the bond should be authorized to the state-owned enterprise for extensive investment based on the established plan. The main objective of various production sectors under the overall plan should be to meet the minimum needs of people's livelihood, so that the problems of overproduction and underproduction will naturally cease to exist. The phenomena of production operators avoiding hard work and seeking shortcuts, and blind investment will also disappear.</p>
<p>(3) The government's investment in production organizations should be in the nature of loans. If a production organization expands through investment, it will have the obligation to repay the principal and interest to the government. The benefits can be described as follows: (A) Since the government's investment in production organizations is in the nature of loans, the interest on this huge bond can be borne by the production organizations. (B) Since the government's investment is in the form of loans, the production organizations must repay the principal and interest to the government on schedule. In this way, the government can circulate the funds and invest in another production organization. (C) Since the economic construction bond is guaranteed first by the government and then by large-scale production organizations, its creditworthiness is outstanding, making it a safe haven for investment.</p>
<p>(4) The construction of production organizations can largely be achieved by forcibly expanding or merging existing production organizations, transforming small-scale operations into large-scale operations and modernizing them. This will save effort and yield quick results, quickly meeting the needs of the people without wasting time. Moreover, since the production organization is a modern, large-scale organization with government assistance, its creditworthiness will naturally be outstanding. However, for its own development, it can also issue shares on the open market to provide flexibility. The issuance of shares has two benefits: (A) After issuing shares, it can utilize external investment, which can accelerate the repayment of government investment and allow it to quickly build another production organization. At the very least, it should prevent delays or defaults in principal and interest payments, which would indirectly prevent the economic construction plan from being completed on schedule. (B) The issuance of shares allows production organizations to have room for expansion and contraction in the market, so that their own development does not rely solely on government support. In this way, the government can have the resources to manage other construction projects without worries. (C) These shares have outstanding creditworthiness, which will provide owners of floating capital with another safe haven.</p>
<p>(5) The government's investment in production organizations should have a flexible interest rate that is not uniform. Because production organizations have uneven performance, with some failing to make a profit for a long time and others making profits easily and abundantly. To provide assistance, the government should lower interest rates or exempt them from interest for those that are not easy to profit from, and raise interest rates for those that are highly profitable, in order to achieve balanced development. Investors should consider both factors, and the overall balance should be relatively even, without excessive disparity, so that there is no need to choose between one or the other.</p>
<p>(6) The management of production organizations must be entrusted to renowned business leaders appointed by the government, with the government only providing necessary supervision and guidance. In short, it is government supervision with merchant operation. In terms of past experience, purely government-run enterprises are overly bureaucratic and often fail. It is undeniable that the mere mention of a government-run enterprise is daunting. Therefore, to adapt to national conditions and public habits, business leaders must be engaged to manage them. In fact, a production organization that is a large-scale state-owned organization and is managed by experienced leaders is the icing on the cake, which is enough to inspire confidence.</p>
<p>(7) Since production organizations are state-owned, they have a monopolistic and patented nature in terms of raw material supply and market sales. Even if the profit margin is extremely thin, it will still be considerable. The government may levy a capital tax on investors in this project and use the capital tax revenue to repay part of the bond.</p>
<p>(8) The repayment of the principal of the bond should only begin after half of the economic construction plan has been completed. If various construction plans can be completed on schedule, the production sector itself will be able to stand on its own and absorb floating capital. Gradually, there will be no need for government funding. If all construction projects are fully completed, floating capital will be brought into line, and the government will no longer need to possess large amounts of capital.</p>
<p>(9) Floating capital can have a correct investment target, thereby entering the state-owned enterprise system. From the perspective of wartime economic footing, this is especially urgent at present.</p>
<p>In short, all government affairs cannot be carried out without finance. Capital is the driving force behind everything. This is an undeniable fact. China's production is backward, coupled with years of war. With such little capital, it is not being used for production but for detached consumption. The future of the national economy is in grave danger. Therefore, guiding it to production and returning it to its origin is an urgent task at present. At present, large amounts of floating capital are struggling to find a safe and profitable outlet. The government should lure it with benefits, provide safety guarantees, and guide it to production. Therefore, if today's floating capital can be put to good use, it may well be the driving force behind China's revitalization. Moreover, the use of bonds for construction is not comparable to the misappropriation of government funds, which is something that the public will be happy to hear. Therefore, if this plan can be implemented step by step, the current phenomenon of blind speculation, excessively inflated securities, manipulated and soaring prices, hoarding and speculation, and all kinds of anxiety and instability in people's livelihood can be swept away.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Work and Interest <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Liuyun</p>
<p>Work and interest are not two unrelated things. On the contrary, to demand the greatest effect and the best results from work, we cannot ignore the factor of interest.</p>
<p>A person who is interested in their work will surely be able to work better, faster, and feel very competent; without the slightest pain. Even if they encounter many difficult obstacles on their work journey, they will not have the intention of retreating or becoming discouraged.</p>
<p>If the great inventor Edison had not been interested in research, he would not have been driven off the train; nor would he have continued his invention work after becoming deaf. It cannot be said that he had few inventions or encountered few difficulties, but he was finally able to overcome them. This was undoubtedly a gift of perseverance, but it was not without the courage that interest gave him in his work, leading him and encouraging him in disappointment to complete his life's great achievements.</p>
<p>Not all interests are good. We should cultivate interest in undertakings that are beneficial to people, otherwise both people and oneself will suffer.</p>
<p>Because of economic, environmental, and objective constraints, work cannot always suit everyone's interests, and thus the complaint of "disliking whatever line you're in" arises. To eliminate this phenomenon, we can start in two ways: first, perhaps the true interest in the work has not been discovered, so it should be cultivated through work. Second, if the work is fundamentally unsuitable for one's temperament, then one should explore where one's interests lie and cultivate them well, because with good cultivation, there will be opportunities to develop them, and it will not be unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Work can relieve worries, inspire new wisdom, and strengthen muscles and bones. Work is not suffering, work is interest. What is more satisfying than the joy after completing work? But what exactly is interest? I can't tell you, I can only say: "It's like a glass of fine wine, the taste is something you have to experience for yourself."</p>
<h3 id="e84">Observation and Enlightenment <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Qiluo</p>
<p>Only observation can increase our knowledge, and only enlightenment can nurture our success.</p>
<p>Observation is a very important thing in daily life. We live in this real society of survival of the fittest, and if we do not observe accurately at all times, we will be eliminated immediately. Wild thoughts are the greatest obstacle to observation, just as a spark of fire can start a prairie fire, so we must find a way to extinguish them.</p>
<p>Gibberish said: "Dreamers forget their surroundings. And those who daydream are often addicted to fantasy lives and have no interest in real life." This sentence is aimed at people who are addicted to daydreaming and do not pay attention to real life.</p>
<p>Edison said: "The things that ordinary people remember in their minds are not even one-thousandth of what they see with their eyes. From this, we can see that our ability to observe is truly pitifully weak."</p>
<p>Even a great scientist like Edison, who had such a strong attention span, lamented his weak observation skills; how much more so we who enjoy his inventions. It can be seen that observation is really not an easy thing.</p>
<p>People often do not want to admit their shortcomings because of arrogance or timidity, and therefore, many unpredictable crises are buried in their lives. These crises can cause them to be squeezed out of the advancing ranks and become a member of disgrace.</p>
<p>The ancient sages had a famous saying: "Know yourself." Usually, we can list others' faults like family treasures, but what we understand the least is ourselves. There are many extremely intelligent people who are vague about their own affairs, which is why they cannot be thoroughly enlightened. Thorough enlightenment is like watching quietly from the sidelines. Because those involved are confused, and those on the sidelines are clear.</p>
<p>Bobbons said: "Everyone must have some undiscovered shortcomings. Many people often do not realize until they are forty or fifty years old some shortcomings that have made them encounter misfortune in their lives." Therefore, if we cannot discover our own shortcomings early and work hard to correct them. Then, we will certainly not reach the road to success easily.</p>
<p>We must first observe, and then we can be enlightened. If we have not discovered our own shortcomings, then we have nothing to be enlightened about. Therefore, observation and enlightenment are closely related, and at the same time, they are both elements of our success.</p>
<p>We must make observation and enlightenment our friends. Always by our side, reminding and helping us deal with complex affairs. We need the power of observation and the power of enlightenment.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Ninth Place in the January Essay Contest: My Life as a Nursing Student <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Huisun</p>
<p>I am a nursing student, a nursing student preparing to become a nurse in the future. In Chinese society, nurses are generally despised. Indeed, the work done by nurses is really base, pouring medicine and tea, and giving patients baths and holding bedpans, which seems like something that maids do. Ordinary modern girls and young ladies disdain to do it. Although I have not yet become a nurse, in the year or so of my internship, I have also done a lot of nursing work. I have seen many patients, and I feel that the most painful and boring time for a person is when they are sick, and the nurse is the caretaker for all people in their most painful and boring times, relieving patients of a lot of pain and boredom. I think this kind of work is very noble, and I think this kind of work that seeks happiness for the masses is the work that people should do!</p>
<p>My first year as a nursing student was only reading, reading like all the students. It was not until the beginning of the second year that I read on the one hand and did a little internship in the ordinary outpatient department of the hospital on the other hand. This outpatient department treats some patients who have not yet been bedridden, but there is not much work to do: just listening to how the doctor asks about the source of the disease, how to prescribe medicine, and how to tell the patient. And in the surgical room, helping the doctor to apply ointment and bandages to the patient.</p>
<p>After interning in the outpatient department for two months, I was transferred to the operating room for an internship. The operating room is a place dedicated to performing surgery. What abdominal surgery, sawing off hands and feet, cutting tumors... It really has everything, and the work I interned in was to prepare and disinfect instruments before surgery. And watch how the doctor anesthetizes the patient and how he makes the incision during surgery. At first, I was a little afraid to see the surgeon using his sharp knife to cut back and forth on the patient's body so quickly, and even turning out the internal organs, but after a few times I got used to it. Sometimes, when a relatively large operation had to be performed, the patient had to be anesthetized with ether first. At that time, the patient was completely unconscious, leaving only the pulse and heart beating, and rapid breathing. No matter what knife cut, he did not feel pain. It is really pitiful and enviable to be able to forget all the emotions at one time! When a patient with appendicitis came, I had to open the abdomen, cut off the rotten part of the intestine, and then sew it up again, which made me admire the omnipotence of science; but at the same time, I also felt the contradiction of mankind; if the lethal weapon had not been invented in the first place, why bother to think of this method of rescue?</p>
<p>After interning in the operating room for two months, I was transferred to the obstetrics department of the inpatient department for an internship. At this time, the work I interned in was to take care of women who were one or two months before and after childbirth, and newborn children. At this time, I realized the pain of giving birth to children, and realized that the love of a loving mother for her children was originally for the hard work of giving birth. Usually, a woman feels a burst of abdominal pain about twelve hours before she is about to give birth, shouting for her mother and father and groaning non-stop. The pain is really unbearable to hear and unbearable to see. After giving birth, she has to go through several months of physical weakness. When she encounters difficult labor, she has to use instruments or even open her abdomen to bring the child out. Giving birth to a child is really not easy! As for the children, some good ones are indeed fat, white and lovely, but some children who have inherited their parents' syphilis are very ugly! The heavy ones are as thin as firewood and die in a few days, and the light ones also become lifelong disabled. All the disabled people in the world, limping, blind, and dumb... were originally due to the inheritance of their parents' syphilis. Every time I held a syphilis child to bathe and change clothes, I always hated and complained about their parents a few words.</p>
<p>Four months later, I was transferred to the surgical ward of the inpatient department for an internship. At this time, my job changed to taking care of surgical patients. Those surgical patients who had undergone surgery did not feel the pain of the incision because of the anesthesia in the operating room; but when they woke up, they were in extreme pain and groaned non-stop, and they had to go through two or three days of being unable to move their whole body. Urinating and defecating had to be done in bed. This time was very in need of someone to take care of them. The rest were some patients with broken hands and feet and large sores. Many of these patients became disabled after being cured. Therefore, my four-month internship in the surgical room was every day among these patients who were about to become disabled and listening to their piercing cries of pain!</p>
<p>Now I have been transferred to the medical ward of the inpatient department for an internship. Chinese people are used to going to the hospital only when they are very sick, so almost all of these medical patients are dying. They are completely different from surgical patients. They have reached a state of extreme physical weakness. They cannot shout in pain like surgical patients. They just groan weakly. Some of them even faint for a few hours. Such patients are the most difficult to take care of. In addition to the daily prescribed temperature checks, pulse checks, breathing checks, medication, and injections, they also have to constantly go to the ward to take care of them. If you are not careful, there is a risk of death.</p>
<p>Because I am used to seeing patients, I know deeply the pain that disease brings to people, and I cannot help but feel sympathy for the patients. I always try my best to take care of them and comfort them. What makes me sad is when I encounter patients who are about to die, they mostly cannot bear to leave their families. It is true that they do not want to close their eyes in death. The inertia when they are about to die is really unbearable, and the sorrow of those who die later, the sad crying of those who die later, men, women, old, and young, often make me cry too! What is even more pitiful are those who wander in other places and die in a foreign land. There are no relatives by their side when they die. How desolate this situation is! When I see all the sorrows of this death, I really hope that I have the magic of bringing the dead back to life!</p>

<p>There was another noisy sound.</p>
<p>"Alas!..." Huang Chong'an sighed.</p>
<p>"Chongweng,..." Yang Zijie comforted.</p>
<p>Yu Duzhou was still staring, but Genming frowned. Yu Duzhou was indeed worried, because at this moment he remembered that a few days ago Yang Zijie had said to him on behalf of Huang Chong'an that after the lunar year, if he had merit, he would come to his private school to study. Huang Chong'an said that the private school that Yougong originally attended had poor teaching methods, which caused Yougong's temper to become worse and worse.</p>
<p>Genming was racking his brains to study: why did he have to eat that way when he had this to eat; why was eating this way bad, but he had to eat that way.</p>
<p>"Go and call Sanhua, only go and call Sanhua," the mother's slightly decisive voice, and then she raised her throat and shouted, "Aunt Qian, Aunt Qian, go and call Miss Three."</p>
<p>"I don't want to eat, vomit, vomit,..." he was still crying, but there was no strength in his voice, just like the distant sound of thunder. Although it was still showing its remaining power, it sounded like the trailing sound of a cicada passing by another branch. It was not terrible at all, but it showed the sadness of its imminent demise.</p>
<p>After a while, silence suddenly reigned over the room. The others certainly stopped talking and persuading, and even Yougong had no sound, which made the people in the study on this side secretly feel that there was an extraordinary situation in that room. No, an extraordinary figure must have appeared.</p>
<p>"Eat if you want to eat, or forget it. What's all the fuss about!" A clear voice resounded throughout the two rooms. "I don't think he'll eat it!" The words implied a meaning of surveillance.</p>
<p>"He ate it, he ate it. Third Sister, please go." Xue Fengchun said with a smile.</p>
<p>"I don't think he'll eat it!" This sentence came out in the courtyard, and then a series of small and rapid footsteps sent the person who said this into the study.</p>
<p>"Miss Three is here," Genming was the first to stand up. "Hello, Miss Three, long time no see,..." he said in a row, his attitude was very natural, very different from when he first came in.</p>
<p>"Uncle Wang, hello." Sincere greeting.</p>

<p>Many grains of sand form a pagoda. Many tiny hairs form a fur coat.</p>
<p>(Letter) We are a group of elementary school students who live with our teachers every day, so we deeply understand the difficulties of the teachers' lives, but we are still children of the consumption era, "our hearts are willing, but our strength is not enough", and we can only sigh helplessly.</p>
<p>Since the Shih Pao Daily News launched the "Elementary School Teacher Medical Assistance Fund", it has aroused the enthusiastic sympathy of the community, which is really admirable. Although we are children, we are also a part of society, and those who are directly helped are the elementary school teachers who do their best for us day and night. Can we stand by and watch? No! Therefore, we all gathered two hundred yuan, which is a small amount, but "small gifts mean a lot," please accept it.</p>
<p>This amount is only one-thousandth of the 200,000 yuan target set by your newspaper, but if all the children in Shanghai can "gather sand to form a pagoda", we will definitely get satisfactory results. All the students of the Private Qicheng Elementary School.</p>
