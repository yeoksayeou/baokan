<p>社評</p>
<h3>希望於全國商業統制總會者</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會於三月十五日成立，到今天恰巧一個月，在這短短的時期中，我們雖在報紙上常常看到該會的動態記載，可是會內的設施以及會務的進展，社會上還不十分明瞭。昨天該會招待新聞界後（載今日本報第四版），我們對於該會的進展，已有一個輪廓的認識。</p>
<p>「統制」是自由的反面，其本身是一個科學方法，凡現時進步的國家，都早巳施行了；尤其在戰時，更有實施的必要性。不過，也有一個前提，就是必須內時因地而制宜合理，在重慶政以統治的省份往往因爲運用上過了火，引起人民的反感，把好的制度演成惡的現象。提到「統制」，令人談虎色變，把它當作惡名詞，這是因爲政治不良，致使「統制」受到不幸的遭遇。</p>
<p>目前全世界各戰時國家，對於物資管理，大都已採用嚴格統制的辦法，尤其日本和德國收到效益最大。我們觀察「統制」的結果，不能因人民受釗刻苦生活，而加以詬病。因爲戰時生活，本來是刻苦的，祇要苦得平等，苦得平均。它們沒有高物價的壓迫，也沒有苦與樂的不均。反觀我們目前情况，因爲未能澈底合理實施統制，就產生了囤積居奇，物價飛漲，有錢者向黑市中仍可得到享受，無錢者連最低的刻苦生活亦不可得。</p>
<p>不過華中的物資統制，過去由友邦日方中持，也巳實施了一年以上，未能獲得預期效果，這是毌容諱言的，最大的原因，就在未能因時因地制宜合理所致。這次日本對華政策轉變以後，即以此物資統制工作交還中國自辦，而政府即遴選民間經濟界領導人物，組織全國商業統制總會，以自治方式辦理統制，這是一種最理想的嘗試。</p>
<p>我們懍於過去統制工作之未能順利進行，而此一工作，在戰時則爲必須辦理，而必須辦到成功。因此，這一責任就落在該會肩上，我們竭誠的盼望該會負起全責，並獻議如次：</p>
<p>（一）統制物資，爲平抑物價，安定民生，該會應懸此爲最高目標，一切措施運用，都以此爲方針。</p>
<p>（二）統制工作，在我國民間毫無經騐，故人民對此尙少認識，辦得好是　當，辦得不好，受責備，恐怕不免的。所以該會領導人物必須胸襟放寬，具有任勞任怨之精神，一切困難毀譽，切不計較，他日成就，社會自有定評。</p>
<p>（三）統制之理論與實踐，正因爲我國尙少硏究與經騐，所以一切設施規章，無例可援，此際自常不厭煩複，考慮周詳。我們認爲統制原是近乎獨裁的制度，所以該會的措置，容或傾向獨裁，這是自然的現象。不過另方面，應　博採輿論，以爲不斷改進的張木。</p>
<p>（四）該會旣爲全國性之商業自治機構，自應避免違背自治精神之現象，現有理監事悉由政府指定，已屬權宜；而限於上海一地，尤與「全國」性不符。應增加名額，容納各重要城市之民間工商界領袖，並以工商界推舉爲原則。</p>
<p>（五）目前除該會以外，辦理物資管理之機構尙多，對於統制工作不無彼此牽掣推諉之處，爲期事權與責任之明確，以利整個統制工作起見，應加歸併或嚴格劃淸事權。</p>
<p>（六）租界內移動物資，雖照條例可自由移動者，有時不能自由，且須向工部局請領移動證，此與整個權職，不免發生衝突與矛盾，也足以影響政府與法令的威信。我們盼望日方當局充分協動，開誠商討，務使不合理的現象，漸决消減。</p>
<p>最後，對於該會的用人，我們特別提出「操守廉潔」四字。老實說，在　風澆漓的今天，莫不誤認「統制」爲「生財之道」，這固然一般人的齷齪心理，因此，當事者更應格外小心，愼於錄用，嚴於考查，樹立揩模。過去曾利用統制機會，假藉日方權勢，而自肥之輩，萬勿容許挿足，以維護刷新人事之優點。</p>
<p>我們站在人民立塲，盼望物資的合理統制，合理分配，是多麽的迫切。在這種情緒之下，期望於該會者也同樣的迫切。當然該會仍需要日方當局的誠意協助與政府機關的督導支持。同時，我們站在輿論界的立塲，也願意溝通人民與該會雙方的意見，共同達成「統制盡利」的目的。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>「戰後問題」是英美的烟幕</h3>
<p>英美爲挽回頽勢，又展開了他們拿手的宣傳戰了，那就是對於處理戰後諸問題的種種提議和討論。</p>
<p>反軸心陣營無論在太平洋在歐洲，都面臨着重大的難關。自蘇聯　至於重慶，雖然利用了所有可以利用的大小國家，但都已到了山窮水盡的地步，無法解救。英美不問這昭昭在目的事實，尙呶呶於戰後諸問題的討論。這雖可視爲盎格魯撒克遜人的頑强，但用之作爲挽回頽勢的宣傳戰，實是不得已而求其次的下策。</p>
<p>在東西兩面，頽勢與日俱深的反軸心陣綫，而討論以勝利爲先決條件的戰後問題，那不是可笑的掩耳盜鈴之愚策，即是悲劇的錯覺的其實反軸心的指導性，很明白在此時討論戰後問題的矛盾與非現實性，他們明知這事實，然而仍播弄愚昧的空論，這裏面包藏着敵方指導們狡猾的詭謀。</p>
<p>在反軸心陣綫日趨衰頹的戰局的現階段，使敵方的指導者們最感到困惑，苦悶的大問題，就是敵國的人民至今還沒有把握住他們自身的戰爭目的。他們還沒有知道爲什麼要把他們的生死來賭博，爲什麼要負担重稅，爲什麼要把他們享樂生活水準减低至饑餓綫上。就以美國而論，軍需生產雖機械地繼續着其程度的增產，但爲了目的不明的戰爭，而無異議地盲目地永無止期的每日支出二億五千萬金元的戰費者，並不是美國的人民。似美國副國務卿威爾斯所稱：敵的指導者現在也不能不從速提出國民所能接受的戰爭目的。這就是最近英美國內乃至歐洲美洲廣佈「戰後新世界的靑色照相」</p>
<p>敵方的指導者們所以把敵國人民認爲無意義的「戰後新世界的建設」爲題目，盛爲討論者，乃是想由此而麻痺本國人民的不安與焦燥之感，而驅之於暴虐的侵略戰。更想因此而欺瞞殘存的中立國家，加入英美的陣營。</p>
<p>羅斯福曾表示「召集反軸心六國會議，討論戰後各種問題。」一面，又從邱吉爾的口中說：「亦戰爭的現階段，而輕易討論戰後的問題等，實愚笨之極。」英美遙相呼應，散放「戰後問題」的烟幕，使無名之師，披上了好看的外衣，把必敗的戰爭，當作必勝的戰爭。</p>
<p>可是羅斯福和邱吉爾的幼稚的詐術，早已露出了很大的破綻，現實主義的蘇聯，鄭重地提出了領土的要求，把英美所高唱的大西洋憲章漠視爲等於零的東西，即爲一例。邱吉爾在蘇聯的强硬態度之前低頭了，向羅斯福懇請把大西洋憲章撕毀。酷虐的現實事態，一舉而摧毀了英美的欺騙手段「戰後問題的討論」。換句話說，英美迫於眉睫的問題，是怎樣跳出敗績與崩潰的運命。他們沒有資格，沒有實力，沒有準備可以討論戰後問題。這是迷惑反軸心陣營諸國家的一種偽裝的狀態。（翔：譯目四月四日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>突尼西亞大戰中心　現更偏重東北境內　軸心軍撤離蘇薩避免威脅　據守新陣地較前愈益鞏固</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　據海通社軍事記者稱、突尼西亞大戰之中心、現更偏重於東北境內、週末時、突尼西亞中部之海岸平原及其西面邊境之山丘間、仍有戰鬥、但軸心軍自失守其　特陣地後、即不能再以弱小之部隊據守南面一帶平原及毫無屏障之中部廣大地區、以抵抗自兩面猛烈攻擊之優越敵軍、因此軸心軍指揮部之任務、爲逐步向突尼西亞東北撤退、蓋該處山丘之區直達海岸、較宜於防守、爲求得實行此項行動、軸心軍乃不得不採取步驟、以阻止美第五軍曁英軍增援部隊在德·義軍大部避離英第八軍而越過開魯安、蘇隨一線向北撤退完成之前、向海岸之蘇隊推進、軸心軍且戰且退、自星期五晨起、劇戰爭星期日晚、已避免此項危險、敵軍使用坦克車二百五十輛（此數在非洲情況中可算爲巨大）、且又僅量利用其步兵及砲隊之優越、故能逐漸將數處陣地之軸心軍迫離、但其向海岸急速推進之冀圖、則未實現、如美軍能較蒙特戈姆萊將軍所部早一日或兩日抵達蘇薩、則與英第八軍作戰之南路德·義軍將受包圍、但巴東將軍所部美軍、於星期日晚始抵開魯安、並未較從南面進攻之英軍前鋒爲早、其時、德·義軍之最後殿後軍、已向北撤退到開魯安、蘇薩一綫之外、此項軸心後衛部隊、於週末掩護主要部隊退卻、其任務頗爲困難、其所掩護之地區、系自史法克斯地區至蘇薩之北進行、殊爲費力、同時此項　後軍又須屢屢回頭與追擊之敵軍苦戰、蒙受損失、突尼西亞北部、週末時、僅有英第一軍之局部攻擊、但敵軍並無値得一提之成就、現時就一般局勢而言、德·義軍放棄突尼西亞南部及中部、已將陣綫大爲縮短、現時軸心軍所守之陣地、較之英軍對馬萊斯陣綫開始大規模攻擊之前、僅及三分之一、陣綫縮短之後、守軍已可集中其部隊、且可充分利用業已縮短之內部交通綫、迅速而輕易的使用其後備於受威脅之地點、但縮短陣綫對於敵人亦屬有利、蓋其可集中其優越之砲火於特定之地段、總之雙方實力仍甚懸殊、</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　軍事專家稱、羅美爾元帥使其軍隊避開敵人之行動旣吿完成、軸心軍在突尼西亞之地位、乃愈益鞏固、德義軍現集中於突尼西亞東北角之新陣地、佔有內綫之一切利益、此在地勢艱險之非洲、特別重要、守軍所需飲料、燃料及軍火等之接濟、已較前數日爲多、突尼斯、比塞大橋頭堡之形勢、尤利於守軍、軸心軍在米特傑遠山谷入口處所佔之山中陣地、可使用重武器、是以羅美爾部隊之撤　新陣地、兵士與軍需實際並無任何損失、</p>

<h3>蘇波國境糾紛的真相　蘇聯堅拒東歐諸亡命政權的要求</h3>
<p>以東歐及巴爾幹諸國爲中心的英美政治工作，在蘇聯的冬季攻勢進展聲中，甚爲活躍，歐洲各亡命政權，亦追隨其後，亦步亦趨，熱中於戰後的處理問題。其中　　著的就是波蘭亡命政權的暗中活動。紅軍的冬季攻勢被德軍阻遏，德軍反攻成功之後，蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基重又提出開闢第二戰綫問題。英美方面的政治第一主義與蘇聯的軍事第一主義的對立更尖銳化起來。而波蘭亡命政權在大西洋　章中所投下的一石，使大西洋　章發生了裂縫，其渦紋漸漸擴大，竟疏間了美蘇的關係，而展開了重大的後果。英外相艾登忽邇地方訪問華盛頓的目的，即想調整史丹萊失言事件以來出軌的美蘇關係，並商議英美對蘇聯與波蘭亡命政權之間發生的國境糾紛問題應取的態度。那麼蘇波國境問題的真想究竟何在呢？</p>
<p>重建波蘭案</p>
<p>問題的開始，由於波蘭亡命政權的首領當一月下旬渡美的時候，行囊中帶了所謂重建波蘭案。據此案，戰後波蘭比　蘇分　前的國境更爲擴大，　　　　　　，　　　　　　，　　　　　　，　　　　　　。</p>
<p>當時紅軍的冬季攻擊正在　　進行中，英美方面對蘇聯勢力的波及歐洲極爲恐　，亟思與蘇聯在此方面成立政治的諒解。英美首腦者不惜低首下心，邀請蘇聯最高國防委員長斯達林出席加　勃朗加會談，終未如願。其焦慮不安的狀態，經由波蘭亡命政權，用試探蘇聯　　的形式表現出來，蘇聯對　　波蘭問題的態度空間如何呢？實爲各方面注意的目標。</p>
<p>英美方面　新聞對此問題分　否兩派，　紐約民　講壇報上伏爾泰李　　所論：一斯堪的那維亞，芬蘭及波羅的海沿岸諸國可「任蘇聯處置。」但據華盛頓的明星報上康斯頓金·普拉溫所論「蘇聯若擊破德軍而獲得了東普魯士地帶的時候，　如保加利亞等亦將參加蘇聯聯邦的組織，而南斯拉夫亦將進入大斯拉夫國俄羅斯同盟關係，而將給與俄羅斯出地中海的出口。」</p>
<p>對於這些英美的國內議論及波蘭亡命政權的暗中活動，蘇聯在二月八日的「真理報」上，由塔斯通訊社表示斷然的否定態度。波蘭亡命政權的要求，否定了烏克蘭人與白俄人之團結的權利，波蘭亡命政權的這種強奪政策，實即暴露了其帝國主義的企圖。波蘭亡命政權的要求原以大西洋　章爲根據，但蘇聯對於大西洋　章的解釋，用其自身的態度稱：「保障各民族因其所好而決定其政治組織的權利」，故大西洋　章並不是支持波蘭亡命政權的護身符」。</p>
<p>這蘇聯的強硬態度，波蘭亡命政權對之問極爲恐慌，即東歐各亡命政權亦均爲之惴惴不安。蘇聯的企圖，不單想併吞舊波蘭國境，並有併吞巴爾幹諸國及西亞諸國的野心。這種恐怖的觀測，使英美感到與蘇聯成立政治的諒解，實爲當務之急。尤其在美國，　駐蘇美大使史丹萊的失　問題，國內不信任蘇聯的思想，　見抬頭。於是在蘇聯對大西洋　章的解釋上，發生神經過敏的揣測。</p>
<p>蘇聯辯解的限度</p>
<p>波蘭亡命政權所提出的重建波蘭案中，是否含有擴張德蘇分割前波領之外的東普魯士蘇北西里西亞等的要求，不甚明瞭。但波蘭亡命政權方面的主張，辯稱：大部分引起現在糾紛的區域，在歷史上固屬於波蘭，即其居民也是波蘭人，尤以威爾那，倫貝爾克二主要都市，在文化上是純粹波蘭都市。問題的中心是蘇聯的戰爭目的與其主張以本國領土爲範圍，斯達林親口說過。</p>
<p>「我們並不以占領別國領土，征服別國國民爲戰爭目的。……我們的第一目的要從德軍手中奪回我們的領土與我們國民。」</p>
<p>但這斯達林的宣言之中所稱的領土與國民，指何範圍而言，成爲問題。二月二十三日紅軍成立二十五周年紀念日斯達林所發的命令書中說：</p>
<p>「我們現在開始蘇維埃·烏克蘭的解放戰，在那裏有數百萬烏克蘭人，更有白俄羅斯，立陶宛，拉脫維亞，愛沙尼亞，摩爾達維亞，克里姆，加萊裡亞諸民族等待我們去解放。」</p>
<p>些指定的民族與領土，蘇聯顯然是認爲本國的領土與國民。　此，波羅的海三國固不必說，即加萊里亞與貝薩刺比亞，並舊　屬白俄及烏克蘭人，如廣義的解釋起來，據蘇聯的斯達林　法所規定，凡德芬分割後的領土與居民，全部算作是屬於蘇聯的。所以波蘭亡命政權的要求，與蘇聯的態度，是否對立，一目瞭然。</p>
<p>英國在背後支持蘇聯</p>
<p>蘇聯的態度，怎樣使與大西洋　章調和呢？這問題的解決，其影響不單決定波蘭亡命政權的命運，並也決定其他東歐諸亡命政權的命運，甚至於誘發英美蘇之間的戰後處理案的破綻。現在　問題已經在事實上使大西洋　章發生破綻，英外相艾登的方美，即爲了彌補修理這破綻，承認蘇聯的態度，而漠視東歐諸亡命政權的要求呢！還是接受諸亡命政權的要求而使蘇聯從其陣營退出。英美現正立於二大之間難爲婦的歧路。但採取現實政策的英國，現在把亡命政權視同幽靈，迎合蘇聯的態度，而企圖調整美蘇的關係。（翔：譯自三月三十一日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>兒童福利座談會(二)　本報社會服務處召集</h3>
<p>本文續四月十日第四版，因連日稿擠未能續刊，今日特移載於此。　編者註</p>
<p>丁秉南先生：現在上海生活高漲，給養不易，難童團體中已有四個遷往鄉間，即幼幼敎養院，上海貧兒院，太嘉賓敎養院，土山灣孤兒院。鄉間空氣好，物價低，且有農事可作生產對象。不過這四個團體均有其條件上的可能性才撤回去的，其他團體或許不易辦到。第一是在上海募款較易，移鄕則募款較難。第二是管理問題，委員會有鞭長莫及之感。第三是經濟問題，搬塲需費，在內地找屋又不易。一個團體移鄕，須準備三個月用費。</p>
<p>阮斌先生：幼幼敎養院，已有一百個小朋友移往徐公橋。遷移時，一切均用自力，兒童且自行背負行裝，故衹費五百元。已移鄕的敎養團體，大可利用其在上海的空校舍，舉辦義務小學，不供給養，經濟方面自較易辦到。這樣，難童移鄕的好處旣可以獲得，同時，都市中另一部份及齡的失學兒童，也可得到求學的機會。</p>
<p>黃好友先生:關於難童營養，工部局兒童保障科也已有研究結果，總之，要以科學的，最低限度的營養標準，供難童需要。</p>
<p>丁福保先生：每個人都希望身體強壯多活幾十年，據我研究，要達到這個目的不難，第一是吃的問題，我國人以前以爲吃肉吃雞吃葷腥，一定會使人強壯，其實大　不然，吃葷有時竟要中毒，吃素也可使身體強壯。蔬菜　面有維太命不少，但不可燒得太透，以免維太命消失。現在米價很貴，可以黃豆粉代，滋養　極度充足，水果中含有維太命C最多，然而吃不起，可以紅蘿蔔白蘿蔔來代替，惟須生食。至於衛生方面，（一）新鮮空氣：在美國，有一種叫「林間學校」的小學，裏面收的學生都是身體較衰弱的兒童，由上可知露天實較室內好。難童學校最好能於晴天時在露天上課，暑天可戴帽，至低限度須將敎室打開窗子。（二）深呼吸：一日三次，每次廿口，繼續行之一月，結果紅光滿面，煥然一新。（三）接觸太陽光：這就是坦胸受日光浴，即日光療法。太陽光爲人生最偉大且不必化錢的補劑。即在冬天，只要溫度在八十度以上，亦可在戶外坦胸行日光浴。</p>
<p>王鶴峯先生：他對土山灣孤兒院因地點關係，難童糧食採辦相當困難，因此月前曾將孤兒七十人遷往靑浦，但因管理上的不便，近又遷回。難童糧食，我人渴望由當局配給。</p>
<p>鍾志剛先生：難童敎養團體能產生一聯合機構，可聯合當局請求配給。</p>
<p>楊頌　先生：難童敎養院難童食米，可代向社會福利局接洽，使最短期間，能獲配給。</p>
<p>陳征帆先生：難童敎養院難童食米，上海市慶祝兒童節籌備委員會已呈請陳市長予以便利，已蒙允許，這真是難童們的一個福音。</p>
<p>陳已先生：義務工作人員，不能久持，應以四育兼長，肯廉潔，有計劃，願苦幹，遂公意，給相當報酬　　之安定生活。難童敎養，只要經費有辦法，養是不成問題的，但養活了，怎麼辦？可知敎的問題極端重要。難童敎養，不能如普通小學，須從小養成他們自立能力。以前辦難童敎養的，每每注重生產，但據我看以生產工作，作難童生活上技術上的訓練則可，如謂將來可以賴之生活，則不可能。所以敎的問題，最好由難童團體合作，共同研究出一新的辦法推行之。以前陶行知所創的小先生制，工學團，在養成兒童自立的能力上，頗有成效，可以仿行。</p>
<p>沈伯英先生：各敎養院過去對難童所施敎育，稍欠合理化，均各有所長，但亦有所短，以後希望能共同討論，互採其長，互去其短。授課時間與年限，要縮短，普通敎本，亦不適用，最好另編。</p>
<p>丁福保先生：難童的寫字能力，大多很差，故須從小加以訓練，敎師在黑板上寫，兒童照着抄寫。同時，寫信也極爲重要。這對於難童將來的出路上，頗有幫助。</p>
<p>丁秉南先生：辦慈幼工作，要出錢，出力，工作人員，三位一體，主持人之稱職，更爲重要。一般敎養院收容難童的出路，依他們年齡上的分別，可分三個時期：（一）初生到六歲，他們的可能出路是被人認養；（二）十歲至十三歲，他們的可能出路是做學徒或練習生；（三）十三至十八，可就一般職業，女生是擇配，辦難童敎育，如果是注重敎，注重養，而不從難童的出路着　，可說只能救一部，而不能救全部。目下由敎養院認養出去的兒童，一般家庭認爲滿意的固有，不滿意的亦多。所以敎師與學生間要發生情感，如學生稱男先生爲爸爸，女先生爲媽媽等，藉以啟發其對家庭樂趣的天性，並養成他們的禮貌。由敎養院出去做學徒的兒童，據調查，遠不及普通淸寒兒童之受歡迎。其故不外普通淸寒家庭，兒童知生活痛苦，謀事困難，故肯刻苦耐勞，敎養院則喫飯無問題，且較窮苦家庭爲舒服。難童做學徒後，他認爲如廠家對己不滿，儘可仍回敎養院去。因此，爲補救是英缺憾　，院方必須調查各工廠學徒的生活標準，以作平日訓導上的參考。將來要擇配的女生，須對她們訓練家事上的常識及技能。</p>
<p>李瑞華女士：難童的年齡有大小的不同，性別有男女的不同，他們的出路，可分認養，就業，擇配等數種。因此所施之敎導，也宜予以劃分。如對預備被人認養的兒童，應特別注重他們的禮貌，對就業者，應養成他們刻苦耐勞的習慣；擇配的女生，須有烹飪，縫紉等家事上的技能。</p>
<p>趙樸初先生：敎養院須辦輕而易舉的手工業，材料可向各敎養團體徵求，或向社會征求，以適應最貼近眼前的需要，　業兒童，多係監獄送來，特重感化品性。</p>
<p>榮柏雲先生：難童在求學時期，必須使他們工作，藉以養成他們的勞苦精神。就土山灣孤兒院的辦法，兒童過了十歲，卽可看出他們對工作的近性，精細的使習細膩的工作，反之，即做較粗的工作，如木工銅匠等。敎養院同時也可因環境上的不同，施以各種不同的勞作生產訓練，如天平農工敎養院，接近郊外，可從事農產製造等。造就有用之人才，所以減少社會不良份子。</p>
<p>朱鈺寶女士：難童給養困難，應提倡認養或領養，至於勞作生產每不適合社會實際需要。最好由難章敎養團體向一般工廠接洽，如有輕　手工藝，可分發至敎養團體工作；或由廠方派技師到敎養團體內訓練兒童，使他們學習適合工廠實際需要的技能。這樣，兒童的生產技能旣可養成，出路也得了保障。</p>
<p>楊頌　先生：工部局近對收容乞丐問題，已有了具體辦法。由工部局撥款一百五十萬元，市政府一百萬元，法公　局七十五萬元，作經常費用，委託世界紅　字會主辦，利用漕河涇游民習　所舊址以收容之，不久可望見諸事實。流浪街頭的難童，也在收容之列。這誠然是街頭窮苦無吿的難童們的福音。</p>
<p>卞煦　女士：在此生活高漲的時候，一般勞工婦女，平日工作收入，還不夠開銷，添了孩子之後，欲顧及孩子即不能工作，欲工作即不能顧及孩子，所以托兒所的增設與改進，實感需要。（完）</p>

<h3>防空須知　問答（一）</h3>
<p>本月十二日起，上海地區連續舉行防空訓練四天，在過去雖然數度實施過防空空訓練，可是一般人的防空知職，還不能說是完全，故特闢一防空講座，解答一切關於防空的疑間，普遍家庭防空知識。</p>
<p>（問）還有一部份人對於警戒管制，空襲管制，燈火管制的區別和處置，似乎不十分明瞭，所以請把警戒警報（晝·夜）空襲警報（晝·夜）的區別和處置詳細解答。</p>
<p>（答）警戒警報一發出，立刻吿訴全部家屬，大家穿起防空工裝，在太平桶內裝滿淸水，把防火用具等，搬到固定地方，同時把發揮油，煤油，以及其他引火物危險品，移到一定的收藏地方，整頓室內，注意一切引火物，這些軍備就緒之後，除了由羣長特別指定担任任務者外，沒有被指派工作的人，應該鎭靜如恒，照常工作。燈火警戒制管的時候：</p>
<p>（一）室外燈火，除該管官廳指定或特許者外，須一律熄滅。（二）室內燈火，必須减小或遮蓋，以不漏燈火至室外爲原則，（1）遮掩可能使燈火外露的窗戶塲合，室內的廣度每三平方米者，應該减小燈火或遮掩燈火在十支光以下的光度，燈火的大小，按照室內面積大小的比率來決定，但最大之房屋，亦不得使用五十支光以上的電燈，故大房間可使用二盞以上的電燈。（2）不遮掩燈光外　的場合，室內的廣度每三平方米，應把光度減小或掩蓋至一支光以下，燈的位置，和窗門口的距離應該相距一·八米以上。</p>
<p>空襲警報一發出，先要防火，把自來火關閉，再把貯水的太平桶檢點一下，必須貯滿淸水，再把自來水總鬥關斷，然後從事下面各種行動，凡是從事防空工作者，一律遵守羣長的指導分配，老弱病者，避在避難所或屋內的安全地點，汽車和一般車輛，一律停靠於不礙交通的地方，普通行人必須遵守鹽督機關和自警團員的指導，從速歸家。燈火管制，室外燈光，除了標職燈之外，全部熄滅，但屬於工作必須的燈，經特別許可者，仍得妥爲遮蓋後使用，室內燈光，能使燈光不外露的室內，務須减小或掩蓋燈光，不能遮掩的地方，必須熄滅。（四月十三日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>全國商業統制總會　昨招待新聞界　報告會務及今後展望　新聞界提出三個問題</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會成立以來、業巳一月、昨日下午假座國際飯店招待本市新聞界、到有中外名報記者二十餘人、該會方面計到理事長唐壽民、監事長聞蘭亭、及高級職員等、首由唐理事長起立致詞、略謂、</p>
<p>唐理事長致詞</p>
<p>今日爲本會成立後第一次正式招待新聞界、蒙諸位光臨指導、不勝榮幸、所有本會工作及任務、已另有書面報吿、爲節省諸位寳貴之時間起見、不再贅述、此外尙有幾點、須請新聞界研究提倡與指敎者、特利用今日機會、提出請諸位賜敎、</p>
<p>（一）此次世界戰爭、各國物資、損耗過鉅、平時生產份子、大部份須從事兵役、同時各國政府、都側重於軍需工業生產、即不得不减少一般生產、此乃事實所必然、故無論在戰爭期內、或在戰事終止以後、欲於最短時期、恢復正常生產、恢復自由貿易、其勢實不可能、必仍繼續採用切合事實之統制主義、毫無疑義、希望新聞界對於統制主義與功用、多多研究提倡、使社會人士注意明瞭、亦即將來减少人民苦悶、與减少推行統制工作阻礙之一法、</p>
<p>（二）投機囤積一事、在任何國家、每遇戰事發生、總不能免、現在成立統制機構、當然希望投機囤積之風、可以消滅、不過個人意見、仍希望各投機份子、能自本良心主張、毅然停止一切有妨礙民生之舉動、其效果當較任何干涉、更爲有力、對於政府方面、第一希望能積極促進生產事業、導納游資於正軌、第二更希望能嚴定法令、公正執行、俾投機囤積之事實、無從發生、以免事後補救、徒滋疑懼紛擾、</p>
<p>（三）本會在中國爲創始機關、事無前例、人無經騐、一切措施、自難期其周密、尤其用人方面、雖一本人才主義、審愼選擇、但人數衆多、賢不肖在所難免、新聞界爲社會喉舌、希望諸位站在監視地位、對於本會各級同人、無論何人、皆採取監察主義、設有所聞、毫不客氣、盡量批評、或逕向本人責問、如有事實可憑者、即逕行露佈、公諸社會、俾有所制裁、以補個人耳目所不及、尤所萬分歡迎、</p>
<p>（四）同盟國在華經營商業、本會已向當局建議公道辦法、不久政府將頒佈保障法令、目前不必過慮、</p>
<p>商統會書面報告</p>

<p>（一）關於組織方面、現在本會事務部門、大致業已完成、關於原在漢彌爾登大厦之許可事務所、當時幸賴實業部派員先行代爲接管、現因本會人事佈置就緒、正向實業部接洽移交、至於業務部門、因各業同業聯合會之組織、最近纔由實業部主持召集發起、並指定發起人、本會擬俟各業聯合會、每成立一業、即設一專部、至逐漸完成爲止、</p>
<p>（二）本會與各業同業公會之聯繫方面、本會原爲商業自治團體、雖第一任理監事人選、俱由政府指定、但其會員、則以各業同業聯合會員爲單位、而各業同業聯合會之會員、則以各地同業公會爲單位、依照步驟、本應由下而上、逐步組織、雖因時間關係、先就總會倉卒組成、但本會使命、仍須俟會員組織完成後、方能順利推行、照上述系統、各地同粱公會應參加聯合會爲會員、並不與本會發生直接聯繫、現在各地同業公會有以組織地方分會爲請、或誤向本會申請備案、是對於規定之系統、尙不免有所誤解、用特就便說明、</p>
<p>（三）關於物資移動方面、一切物資、在蘇浙皖三省及京滬兩特市區域內、其取締範圍、巳經政府頒布戰時物資移動取締暫行條例、詳細規定、依照上項條例規定、取締移動之物資、計分一、由上海統制綫內運出者計十二項、二、運入上海統制綫內者計二項、均須經本會許可、方得運入運出、即以上十四項取締移動之物資、如不經過上海統制綫、而祗在上海統制綫以內及三省兩市區域間之移動、亦可自由、不加限制、此外不受取締之物資、自更無論矣、現在法令初行或尙未普遍周知、難免有誤會阻止情事、各地同業公會及商人等、紛紛來函請求救濟、現已由本會電請實業部再行分別咨令關係機關查照、以恤商艱、</p>
<p>（四）關於本會以後工作之預期方面、此次友邦毅然將物資統制權交還我國、固屬萬分熱忱、令人欽感、且交還以後、仍本友好精神、眞誠協助、允應感謝、此事關係民生至重且大、深望友邦及我工商各界、協助本會通力合作、以底於成、本人以爲統制之意磯、不僅以配給及許可爲限、其重要工作、當謀物資來源之疏通、產量之增加、調節供求、以期適合支配、而物價亦可得合理之調整、此則本人所尤爲企求、自當督率本會同仁、本上下一貫之精神、努力推進、以副各界之期望、更有言者、本人立身社會、供職金融界三十餘年、未嘗一日間斷、今承政府之謬選、本不敢負此重任、因鑒於此事有利民生、義不容辭、乃勉力承担、所幸同會諸公、均爲社會之領袖、且有爲本人之前輩、有自遵循、惟一般社會人士、對於此統制工作之精神、能吾深切了解、實有顆於新聞界諸公不時提不、則其效力之宏大、當較政令尤爲有力、至於本會一切措施、今後亦本萬分眞誠、接受新聞界之隨時指示、俾本會得採納各方意見、以完成任務、不僅本人深切感謝、凡我同會諸公、亦無不感謝也、</p>
<p>新聞界代表致詞</p>
<p>新聞界代表陳彬龢起立發言、略謂、商統會成立以來、未逾一月、而內部機構已組織完善、今日承貴會招待、得能參加、甚爲欣幸、商統會之工作、最爲艱難、而領導工作諸公、皆能任怨任勞、尤爲吾人所欽佩、查統制工作、自大東亞戰爭迄今、向由友邦日方主持、過去因民間對於統制工作之意義、頗多不能了解者、而友邦統制當局方面、亦因缺乏與中國民間工商界接觸之機會、雙方均感不便、今次友邦日方毅然將物資統制權交還我國、由經濟界領導人物唐壽民聞蘭亭諸氏等主持、相信從此之後、統制工作必能較過去便捷而順利、過去我們常常批評政府辦理不善、現在旣然交由人民辦理、那末我們一定要辦好、頃間唐壽民先生云、請新聞界站於監察地位、此言似覺過謙、但吾人亦不欲辭其責、願在合作地位、將民間之希望與意見傳達於商統會、同時將商統會當局之意向與抱負、轉達於民間、疏通雙方之情意、不特我言論界如此、更願各界人士一致協力推動、協助統制工作之成功、末有三點、擬請唐理事長在可能範圍中予以解答、第一、各業同業聯合會、何時可以組織完成、第二、工部局所轄之統制機構、何時可移交、第三、棉紗棉布何以要特別處理、</p>
<p>唐氏解答三點</p>
<p>旋由唐理事長起立答復、略謂、陳先生、所詢問之三點、分答如决、第一、本會自三月十五日成立迄今、不滿一月、在創辦伊始、致力於內部機構之組織、目下之工作狀况、可分兩部份、一爲事務部門、大體巳吿完成、一爲業務部門、此卽各粱同業聯合會之組織、此事最近由主管機關實業部主持進行中、大的遲至本月底可望完成、第二、工部局所辦理之統制事宜、並不因本會成立而中止、他如市政府法公董局亦照常辦理一部份之統制工作、本會與以上三機關密切聯絡、故無所謂移交、第三、棉紗布並朱特別處理、棉紗布爲重要物資之一、曾經先辦登記、惟以政府認爲上海之棉紗棉布市價、上落過巨、曾下令澈查原委、故雖經登記之棉紗棉布、仍暫不能移動、但本會亟　政府能早日查明、故已向政府建議辦法、希望早得自由移動、</p>
<h3>經濟界</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，新　業向志記茶號　茶芯六十餘箱，市氣堅秀。龍井茶初次新貨，已有十餘斤到滬，開價甚昂。</p>
<h3>評言　澈查投機囤積感言</h3>
<p>最近最動人聽聞的，要算是本月七日國府澈查上海金融機關主要職員投機囤積重要物資情事的命令了</p>
<p>本月八日滬上各重要物資的黑市價格果大跌特跌。本來，過去滬上許多物資黑市價格的上漲是人爲的成份居多，所以對症下藥，負安定民生責任的行政當局，亦必須以人爲手段使之下降。</p>
<p>古書說：「民之所好好之，民之所惡惡之。」民就是最大多數的老百姓。老百姓所最好的即爲物價低平，生活安定，所最惡的即爲物價高漲，生活困苦。所以老百姓最痛恨投機囤積，高抬物價者，今政府從而痛恨之，下命澈底查辦，眞可謂能從民所惡的了。</p>
<p>或謂司馬遷說過：「天下熙熙。皆爲利來；天下攘攘，皆爲利往，」可知社會上各色人等無一不爲利，彼投機囤積者亦不過是熙熙攘攘之允者，何足深責？記者以爲此言錯了，因爲史公所說的乃指人已兩利的尋常謀生者而言，非指黑了良心，瘦人肥己，人哭己笑，人死己活，拚命發國難財者而言。孟老夫子說：「惻隱之心，人皆有之，」想不到投機囤積大發國難財者之爲例外。此則不但是利令智昏，而且是利令心黑了。</p>
<p>國家對已經利令智昏心黑者，查出後目須法辦，對尙未利令智昏心黑者，此後亦須提倡君子以義爲利的高尙人生哲學；國家爲增强國防起見雖須側重物質，而人民個人爲人己交利起見則必須側重精神，以德性爲財富。法治與德治兼施，則目前的難局一定可以克服。</p>

<h3>不滿足</h3>
<p>— 凌祖仁</p>
<p>有人說：人的慾望是永不會滿足的。有上千百萬資產的人，還仍不是削尖了頭，儘往錢眼裏鑽？慾壑的確難塡的。</p>
<p>知足可以常樂，但是在現實世界上，有那一個是知足的大傻瓜呢？</p>
<p>張開眼看見的，耳朶聽見的，報紙上記載着的，全是一些不滿足的消息，『生活上的不滿足』，『精神上的不滿足』，『事業上的不滿足』，一切都是『不滿足』，『不滿足』差不多已成爲世界上一種時髦病了。</p>
<p>寫文章，一定須寫『不滿足』的女章，說話，也須說『不滿足』的話，否則，就是不適合時代；也實在的，現時代，不是一個令人滿意的時代，是太使人失望的一個時代呀！</p>
<p>不過，話又說回來了，「不滿足」，實亦是一種人類進化的現象，因爲：他們的所以對於現實的世界，會感到『不滿足』，那末一定是給他們發現了世界的劣點，同時，在他們的理想上，也一定有着一種美滿的憧憬。</p>
<p>所以，『不滿足』也該是値得禮讚的一種人類應有的雄心，因爲，它既感到現實的不滿足，一定會在理想上，潛藏着一種美滿的改造，但是，假使它僅會感到『不滿足』，而想不到改造，那末，這一種『不滿足』，是一種徒然的直覺。</p>
<p>感到『不滿足』，而蓄意去改進，才是人類一種美的德性</p>
<p>幾千年以前的我們的人類，假使僅是『不滿足』它當時的現實環境而不去改進，那末，到現在我們仍該依舊逗留在茹毛飮血的生活環境裏。</p>
<p>所以，人類的『不滿足』，並不是一種不知足的劣性，但是您須記得，『不滿足』並不是光是搖搖筆桿，或者唱唱高調，就能夠給您帶來滿足的，應該由您自己努力改進的。</p>
<p>現世界和現社會上的一切，固然是那般的使我們不能够滿足，但是，我們何嘗不可以把它銳變呢？您們瞧，不是已有着小少的先進，把他們的實血，在代我們創造了一條前進的路嗎？那末；我們該踏着他們的血跡，走向我們理想巳久的，使人滿足的世界裏去呀！</p>
<h3>二月份徵文錄取第六名　怎樣讀書？讀什麼書？</h3>
<p>— 梅志存</p>
<p>我們求學問的目的是爲了學習做人的道理，生活的技能和謀增進人類的幸福。達到這目的方法之一就是讀書。我們固然可以從日常實際生活中，獲得比書本上更爲深刻而切實的經騐和智識。但是這種由直接觀察自身體騐得到的學問究屬有限，費力也多。書籍是有系統組織記錄人類一切經驗和智識的寳庫，所傳達的最爲廣博，學習起來也比較經濟簡捷。現代世界文明日進，　讀的書實在多得不可勝算。在這種情况之下，讀書要得到確實的效果，只有講求經濟以硏究之</p>
<p>讀書的經濟不外乎精力經濟和時間經濟。要達到這目的就須明瞭讀書的原則，具備推動和進行的要素，實行科學的方法。</p>
<p>（一）原則—「精」與「博」是讀書的兩大原則。古今論讀書的人，有的主專精，有的主通博，都是經騐之談。但是「精而不博則迂，博而不精則濫。」單偏於一種是不行的。如果興之所至什麽書都讀，什麽學問都研究，結果是什麽都小懂得透澈，一無所用。然矯枉過正，只讀一門書，其他一概不讀；這樣就雖免鑽到牛角尖裏去，迂而不化了。學問是共通的互相關連的。假如沒有其他部門的普通智識，坐井觀天就小會知道自己所硏究的對於人類有多少價値，處於何種地位，應該做些什麽工作；結果是成了一個與實際社會脫離關係的書獃子，又有何用處？所以爲求學以致用，我們讀書必須專精一門—你所愛讀及　讀的還要博通其他基本學識。</p>
<p>要素—讀書原是一種心理的活動，若無推動它的原動力和具有定向恒久不變的推進力；便易受外界刺激紛擾之影響，時易方針或半途而廢。原動力是什麽呢？父母的敎訓，師長的督促，不，都不是。眞芷的原動力是興趣、推進力又是什麽呢？恒心堅毅和進取的精神，健全的身體，生活的需要及社會的讚賞都是支持讀書的推進力。換句話說，興趣，恒心，堅毅和進取的精神及健全的身體是讀書必須具備的要素；這些都關係個人的修養，尤須培養鍛鍊的。</p>
<p>（三）方法—讀書旣定了原則，具備了動力，怎樣去實行才能得到確實的效果，最大的效　呢？這就要運用科學的方法了。簡括的說，科學的方法是一種有系統有計劃的方法。將我們所讀書籍中的智識，按步就班施以有系統的檢討，分門別類來研究，擇其精要的吸收而運用罷了。</p>
<p>（甲）原理的方法：（一）分析（二）歸納（三）比較（四）觀察（五）推論（六）假想（七）應用</p>
<p>（乙）技巧的方法（一）理解（二）記憶（三）默讀（四）朗誦（五）靜思（六）筆記（七）練習（八）疑問。</p>
<p>在運用讀書的方法時，還須注意後列三點：</p>
<p>（一）各種學術都有它獨特之點，讀書方法不外上述各種；然採取那幾種，怎樣分配運用，要在能隨機應變，因事制宜。—活的運用。</p>
<p>（二）我們須將讀咨的時間以適當合理的支配，充分的利用，以期用最少的工夫獲得最大的效果，譬如在淸晨精神最飽滿的時候去讀書自然可得較大的效率。</p>
<p>（三）取得讀書的環境—注意空氣，光綫，淸靜等，務求適當。</p>

<h3>根</h3>
<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>「胡說！」大根一篩身體將虎根的手篩去了。不過大根並不走開，他只在那裏着。片刻之間，他雖不迎上去，而打架的中心却迎過來了，他發見四週巳都是打架的人。</p>
<p>「就是那個小婊子養的！就是那個小婊子養的！」一個麻面的大漢，一面駡着，一面向虎根奔來，等到虎根要想防備，肩胛上已着了一拳，受不住，就此跌到了地上。</p>
<p>「嚇，你欺侮孩子！」麻面的大漢還想再打地上的虎根，大根喝了一聲，也照樣一拳打在他的肩胛上，他也就踉蹌幾步，坐到了地上</p>
<p>麻面的同幫，山北人，倚仗人多，向大根一齊湧來。</p>
<p>「阿虎快些走開！」大根一面招架，一面掩護着已從地上爬起來的虎根，逐步退開去。</p>
<p>山北人受不了大根的拳頭，因此雖然人多，並不敢十分切近，當面搏鬥，只想覷便在背後打冷拳。不過他們的嘴裏，還在喊着「打死這些婊子養的！」以示威。</p>
<p>虎根乘一個便鑽了出去，一路上喊着：「山北人打山南人，山南人快快上去！」他向四處叫救兵。</p>
<p>大根退到了一個高墩邊。他往墩上一站，握着拳，怒着目，看着四週的人。誰想上來，他就對付誰，誰果然衝上來，他就跨下一步，一拳將他打回去。打了幾個，因此誰也不敢眞正衝上來，至多只衝到一大半的高度，大根的拳頭打不到他身上的地方，就連忙退下去。久而久之，大人與大人的眞正打架，却變得像孩子與孩子的有意玩笑。不過他們還老是圍着不散開，似乎圍了一個城，要等城中人筋疲力盡，自然屈伏。（三十）</p>

<h3>爲何你能自由行動？</h3>
<p>— 李思遂</p>
<p>有人問一你怎樣知道上和下的？」回答是和當困難的，大多數人說「這是天生的機能。」但這回答不够科學化。當你站直時，你會知道頭在上，當你游泳跳水時，你會知道頭向下。爲什麼你小會弄錯呢？</p>
<p>在你耳朶內部，有一個橡皮袋，裏面盛滿了油質還有一些小的石灰石。袋的內部邊緣佈滿了細毛連　着神經系統。當你站直在地上時，由於地心吸力的關係，小石灰石聚在橡皮袋的下端，細毛受了壓力，神經系統立刻吿訴你，你的頭是向上了。如果你睡在牀上，小石灰石便聚在袋的側面，同樣地吿訴你方向。這能發生機械作用的橡皮袋，普通稱它做耳囊。</p>
<p>「啊，原來如此，其關誰不知道呢！」但是，朋友！你別輕視它。如果耳囊裏那些細毛失去作用時，你也就上下不分的了。</p>
<p>魚在水中之所以不會翻過身來游，也單憑這些作用。你如果不信，你自己可以做個實騐。拿去在魚缸中的沙石，代以很細的鐵砂。魚還能知道方向的。如果你用一塊磁鐵繫在魚的兩側，然後再放回原缸中。鐵砂很迅速地聚在魚的兩側，那條魚便失去辨別方向的能力，或者神經系統因而破壞，便做了你試騐的犧牲品。</p>
<p>你已知道上下左右的方向以後，你又怎樣知道走上和走下呢？耳神經吿訴你那裏在上以後，神經中樞立刻命令你的手足去把身體向上移，誰是郵差呢？命令交到什麼地方呢？所有情報，是由「京尼些踢」Kinaesthetie神經帶到骨節和肌肉去的。傳遞路綫是脊髓骨旁的神經主系。如果花柳菌侵入該部，整個「京尼些踢」神經首當其衝，手足因而脫離司令部的指揮的了。癱瘓或者中風就出現了。這種人走起路來不能正步，就是我們常說的曳行。如果你把他雙自縛起來，他就不能行動的了。這是「淋巴」症象。因爲京尼些踢」神經再也不能把情報從腦帶到肌肉和骨節去。折骨和嚴重傷害神經同樣會產生這種可怖的結果。</p>
<p>息了這種疾病的人，上下扶梯尙能自如，那簡直是奇跡，雖然在常人看來是最平常沒有的事。</p>
<p>朋友，現在你知道爲什麼你能自由行動了嗎？</p>
<h3>謙虛之眞偽</h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>眞率的謙虛，是人類最好的特性之表現，是「鎮定」和「坦白」之產物。眞的謙虛是不傲慢的，光明磊落的，他承認自己有限的能力和思想是不能够去解決世界一切的問題，但並不因此而消沉；在表面上儘可謙虛，但內裏他知道在這廣大無垠的世界上有自己的一席地位與計劃，雖然能力有限，頭腦薄弱，但仍是要長久地勇敢，毅力地去硏究，擴大自己的一份力量，有多少成就便是酬報，但絕不誇張……這種「積極性」的謙虛，正像一顆生得低矮的百合花，外表雖謙虛，但仍不失爲一種聖潔高貴的花，放出芬芳的香味來。</p>
<p>當然，我們需要的是這種「謙虛」。</p>
<p>可是，很不幸，我們已發現了冒牌的謙虛。已有一種僞的謙虛存在一些人們心中。</p>
<p>僞的謙虛，說得明白點，他比了自誇自大更爲惡劣，自誇自大倒是有坦白存在，因爲他是利己的直認，雖爲惡德，但可以使別人防備他，欺騙不了別人，因爲自大自誇的結果，受罪的是他自己，與別人毫無關係，可是，僞的謙虛却不同了……</p>
<p>偽的謙虛騙自己又騙別人的惡德，戴了面具，別人旣不能不受欺騙，而當他走到鏡子面前時，他自己也受了蒙；但到底什麽是僞的謙虛呢？張開慧目，你便可以有經騐遇到這種僞君子。</p>
<p>譬如有一種人，他實在很有能力去幫助別人，幫助社會上受到痛苦的人，但他却「謙虛」地說：「我實在沒有能力呀！』可是我敢說世上沒有一個人會得不能分毫幫助別人。</p>
<p>更有一種人，他們終身被僞的謙虛所害，明明他可以有能力去幹某種事業，但是他却在想「算了，我有這種能力嗎？」當別人交給他一件義務時，他也是說：「唉！我是一個手無縛鷄能力的可憐人啊！請你去找別人吧！』……我們可以設想這種人所應得的結果的是什麼！</p>
<p>所以當我們在謙虛時，應要自問這種謙虛是必要的嗎？眞的？僞的？千萬別把自己埋葬，和欺騙別人，否則，那太可惜！也太可怕了！</p>
<h3>今日</h3>
<p>— 丹若</p>
<p>『今日事，今日畢』這是一句很通俗的格言，世人雖然很了解這句格言的眞諦，確是爲人處世的金科玉律，但是多數都沒有毅力去實行，於是失去機會，錯過現實，許多的事業都失敗了。</p>
<p>我們要知道：今日就是今日，就在我們的眼前，是實際的。我們爲什麼要錯過這樣的機會呢？雖然過了今日，還有明日，可是明日是想像的，是空虛的，況且明日有明日的事，今日事而今日不畢，至少明日事也要蒙受相當侵蝕了！今日旣然現關在我們的眼前，我們就得有決心的用力抓住它，充分利用它，切不可虛度它！每人要反詢自己——今日應該吃的飯，可以今日不吃，等待明日去吃嗎？那麼今日應該做的事，爲什麼要等待明日去做呢？</p>

<h3>Hopes for the National Commercial Control Association</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association was established on March 15th, and today marks exactly one month. During this short period, although we have often seen reports of the association's activities in the newspapers, the facilities within the association and the progress of its work are still not well understood by the public. Yesterday, the association hosted the press (as reported in today's fourth edition of this newspaper), giving us a rough understanding of the association's progress.</p>
<p>"Control" is the opposite of freedom, but it is itself a scientific method. All advanced countries today have already implemented it; especially during wartime, its implementation is even more necessary. However, there is also a premise that it must be appropriate and reasonable, adapting to the time and place. In provinces ruled by the Chongqing government, the excessive use of control has often aroused resentment among the people, turning a good system into a bad phenomenon. Mentioning "control" makes people turn pale, regarding it as a bad word. This is because of poor governance, which has led to "control" suffering an unfortunate fate.</p>
<p>Currently, all wartime countries around the world have adopted strict control measures for the management of materials, with Japan and Germany achieving the greatest benefits. Observing the results of "control," we cannot criticize it simply because the people are forced to endure a hard life. Because wartime life is inherently hard, it is only important that the hardship is equal and average. There is no oppression of high prices, nor is there an imbalance between hardship and pleasure. Looking back at our current situation, because we have failed to thoroughly and reasonably implement control, speculation and hoarding have arisen, prices have soared, and those with money can still enjoy luxuries in the black market, while those without money cannot even afford the most basic hardships.</p>
<p>However, the control of materials in Central China, which was previously overseen by our ally Japan, has also been implemented for more than a year, without achieving the expected results. This is undeniable, and the biggest reason is the failure to adapt reasonably to the time and place. After the recent change in Japan's policy towards China, this work of material control was handed back to China for self-management, and the government selected leaders from the private economic sector to organize the National Commercial Control Association to manage control in a self-governing manner. This is the most ideal attempt.</p>
<p>We are apprehensive about the past failure of control work to proceed smoothly, and this work, in wartime, is necessary and must be successfully completed. Therefore, this responsibility falls on the shoulders of the association. We sincerely hope that the association will take full responsibility and offer the following suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) The association should set the highest goal of controlling materials to stabilize prices and secure people's livelihoods, and all measures and operations should be guided by this principle.</p>
<p>(2) Control work is without experience in our private sector, so the people still lack understanding of it. If it is done well, it is appropriate; if it is done poorly, criticism is probably unavoidable. Therefore, the leaders of the association must have a broad mind and a spirit of hard work and dedication, without being concerned about difficulties, praise, or criticism. The achievements will be evaluated by society in the future.</p>
<p>(3) The theory and practice of control are lacking in research and experience in our country, so there are no precedents for all facilities and regulations. At this time, one should not be afraid of complexity and should consider things thoroughly. We believe that control is inherently a near-dictatorial system, so the association's measures may tend towards dictatorship, which is a natural phenomenon. However, on the other hand, it should widely solicit public opinion as a basis for continuous improvement.</p>
<p>(4) Since the association is a national commercial self-governing organization, it should avoid phenomena that violate the spirit of self-government. The current directors and supervisors are all appointed by the government, which is expedient; and being limited to Shanghai is inconsistent with being "national." The number of positions should be increased to include leaders from the private industrial and commercial sectors of major cities, and the principle of election by the industrial and commercial sectors should be followed.</p>
<p>(5) At present, there are many institutions besides the association that manage materials, which inevitably lead to mutual constraints and buck-passing in control work. To clarify authority and responsibility and to facilitate the overall control work, these institutions should be merged or their authority should be strictly demarcated.</p>
<p>(6) The movement of materials within the concessions, although freely movable according to regulations, is sometimes not free and requires applying to the Municipal Council for a movement permit. This inevitably conflicts with the overall authority and is sufficient to affect the credibility of the government and laws. We hope that the Japanese authorities will fully cooperate, discuss openly, and gradually resolve unreasonable phenomena.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the association's employment of personnel, we specifically propose the four words "integrity and honesty." To be honest, in today's declining moral atmosphere, many people mistakenly regard "control" as a "way to make money," which is the sordid mentality of the general public. Therefore, those in charge should be extra careful, prudent in employing people, and strict in investigating, to set a model. Those who have previously used control opportunities, taken advantage of Japanese power, and enriched themselves must not be allowed to intervene in order to maintain the advantages of refreshing personnel.</p>
<p>Standing from the people's perspective, we hope for the rational control and allocation of materials, how urgent it is. Under this sentiment, the expectations for the association are equally urgent. Of course, the association still needs the sincere assistance of the Japanese authorities and the guidance and support of government agencies. At the same time, standing from the perspective of public opinion, we are also willing to communicate the opinions of the people and the association to jointly achieve the goal of "maximizing the benefits of control."</p>
<p>Translation and Discussion</p>
<h3>"Post-War Problems" are a Smokescreen of the United States and Britain</h3>
<p>In order to save their declining momentum, the United States and Britain have launched their familiar propaganda war, which is the various proposals and discussions for dealing with post-war issues.</p>
<p>The anti-Axis camp is facing major difficulties in both the Pacific and Europe. From the Soviet Union to Chongqing, although they have used all the large and small countries that can be used, they have reached the end of their ropes and cannot be saved. The United States and Britain, regardless of this obvious fact, are still chattering about discussing post-war issues. Although this can be seen as the stubbornness of the Anglo-Saxons, using it as a propaganda war to save the declining momentum is really a last resort.</p>
<p>With the anti-Axis front declining day by day on both the Eastern and Western fronts, discussing post-war issues that take victory as a prerequisite is either a ridiculous ostrich policy or a tragic illusion. In fact, the Axis leadership clearly understands the contradiction and unreality of discussing post-war issues at this time. They know this fact, but they still play with ignorant empty talk. This contains the cunning schemes of the enemy leaders.</p>
<p>At the current stage of the war, when the anti-Axis front is increasingly declining, the biggest problems that the enemy leaders feel most confused and depressed about are that the people of the enemy countries have not yet grasped their own war aims. They still do not know why they should gamble their lives, why they should bear heavy taxes, and why they should reduce their standard of living to the starvation line. Taking the United States as an example, although military production continues to increase mechanically, it is not the American people who blindly and endlessly spend 250 million gold dollars a day for a war with an unclear purpose. As U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Welles said: The enemy leaders must now quickly propose war aims that the people can accept. This is why the "Blue Photograph of the Post-War New World" has recently spread widely in the United States and Britain, and even in Europe and the Americas.</p>
<p>The reason why the enemy leaders are vigorously discussing the "construction of a post-war new world," which the enemy people consider meaningless, is to paralyze the sense of unease and anxiety of their own people and drive them to violent aggression. They also want to deceive the remaining neutral countries and join the camp of the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>Roosevelt once said that he would "convene a conference of the six anti-Axis countries to discuss various post-war issues." On the one hand, Churchill said: "It is extremely stupid to easily discuss post-war issues at the current stage of the war." The United States and Britain echoed each other, releasing the smokescreen of "post-war issues," putting a good-looking coat on the nameless division, and treating the doomed war as a sure victory.</p>
<p>However, Roosevelt and Churchill's childish tricks have already revealed great flaws. The realistic Soviet Union solemnly put forward territorial demands, disregarding the Atlantic Charter that the United States and Britain trumpeted as equal to nothing, which is one example. Churchill bowed his head to the Soviet Union's tough attitude and begged Roosevelt to tear up the Atlantic Charter. The cruel reality destroyed the United States and Britain's deceptive means, "the discussion of post-war issues," in one fell swoop. In other words, the pressing issue for the United States and Britain is how to jump out of the fate of defeat and collapse. They have no qualifications, no strength, and no preparation to discuss post-war issues. This is a disguised state to confuse the countries of the anti-Axis camp.

<h3>The Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Naval Air Force War Results, Large-Scale Offensive Launched in the Pacific, Two British Military Bases in Arakan Bombed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 13th: (1) The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force bombed enemy ships in the Oro Bay area of New Guinea on April 10th and 11th, and attacked a large number of enemy aircraft, sinking three enemy transport ships, one destroyer, shooting down 21 fighters, and severely damaging several small ships. Six of our aircraft were self-detonated or did not return. (2) The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force bombed enemy airfields and ships in Port Moresby on April 12th. The results and our losses are recorded as follows: one enemy transport ship sunk, 28 enemy aircraft shot down, several large aircraft and more than ten small aircraft destroyed on the ground. In addition, several ground military facilities and more than 20 barracks were destroyed. Our losses were limited to only five aircraft self-detonated.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) In the South Pacific, the Japanese Naval Air Force, with a large joint formation of fighter-bombers, attacked enemy positions in Oro Bay and Port Moresby, New Guinea, during the day on the 12th and 13th, and immediately launched a fierce air annihilation battle. Not only did it pose a great threat to the heart of the American and Australian forces in the South Pacific, but also the enemy's supply routes in New Guinea were severely hit. At the same time, the enemy's attempted movements will also be completely crushed. It is reported that on the 12th of this month, when the Japanese aircraft attacked Oro Bay in New Guinea during the day, they first sank one enemy destroyer and one small transport ship each heading west 15 kilometers east of the bay. Then, in Huawai Bay, 20 kilometers south of Oro Bay, they sank another enemy 2,000-ton transport ship. Several small enemy ships docked on the coast of Oro Bay were also damaged. These attacked transport ships were all loaded with soldiers, supplies, or military supplies. The enemy suffered heavy losses, and their embarrassing situation is not difficult to imagine. Some Japanese aircraft were self-detonated or did not return due to enemy anti-aircraft fire, totaling six aircraft. The next day, the Japanese aircraft were dispatched again during the day to bomb Port Moresby. At that time, they engaged in a fierce air battle with the American and Australian air forces. The Japanese aircraft first sank one enemy 7,000-ton transport ship docked in the port, and then fought with the enemy aircraft groups that took off to reinforce from various places. As a result, 28 enemy aircraft were shot down, and several large enemy aircraft parked on the ground were bombed, causing heavy damage. Nearby enemy military facilities, fuel depots, etc., were also bombed and caught fire. In addition, more than ten small enemy aircraft were also strafed by Japanese aircraft, and were hit by bullets and caught fire and burned. At that time, the Japanese aircraft turned to attack more than 40 enemy barracks, destroying more than half of them. The power of the Japanese naval aircraft has been fully demonstrated, and the enemy forces here have to be terrified.</p>
<p>Argentina, Kyoto, 13th (Central News Agency) After the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced the news of the fierce bombing of Oro Bay by the Japanese naval air force on the 12th, it stated that the Japanese army is now increasing its air force strength and can launch an offensive in the Southwest Pacific at any time. According to a telegram from Melbourne, the Anti-Axis Command announced that Japanese bomber squadrons and fighter squadrons came together to bomb Oro Bay on New Guinea Island and engaged the Anti-Axis Air Force in a fierce battle. Japanese aircraft dropped many bombs on the fleet, and one small ship of 2,000 tons was hit by two bombs. In addition, there was some damage and casualties. According to reconnaissance, the Japanese air force's combat power has increased significantly. Judging from the recent attacks by the Japanese army, it is expected that the Japanese army has launched an air force offensive, and the scale is very large.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Melbourne, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 12th that the Japanese air force bombed the Anti-Axis landing ground in Port Moresby on the 12th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Wellington, New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser stated on the 12th that a New Zealand bay defense ship was sunk by Japanese naval aircraft in the Solomon Islands on the 8th.</p>
<p>Stanford, 13th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from New Delhi, the British Indian Military Headquarters announced that the Japanese air force bombed two British military bases on the northern coast of Arakan on the 11th. The detailed damage is unknown.</p>

<h3>Lu Yu-Jin, War Results of the Japanese Army in Three Provinces</h3>
<p>Beijing, 13th (Central News Agency) The Chinese and Japanese armies, in order to annihilate about 5,000 people under the command of Zhang Jingyue, commander of the 15th Shandong Security Brigade of the Chongqing forces, who were entrenched near Shouguang County, Shandong Province, began operations on the 11th, and immediately captured the Chongqing army's bases in Tianliuhe and Lintan Sanjiamiao Dian Shizhuang, and compressed the encirclement.

<h3>Relief for Civil Servants: Implementing a Material Salary System Approved Yesterday by the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - Minister Gu of the Food Ministry, previously noting the difficult living conditions of civil servants, proposed to the Executive Yuan the implementation of a material salary system to provide relief. This proposal was submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Central Political Committee, chaired by Mr. Chen, and then presented to the Supreme National Defense Council's temporary meeting on April 9th for discussion. The Executive Yuan has now received a reply from the Secretariat of the Supreme National Defense Council, instructing the ministries of Food, Finance, and Industry to draft detailed implementation measures for review and approval. After receiving the order from the National Government, the entire plan will be promulgated and followed.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the scarcity of materials and rising prices, the living conditions of general civil servants have become increasingly difficult. Although the government has repeatedly tried to increase salaries, a fundamental solution has not been achieved. Simultaneously, since the National Government's entry into the war, all materials, under the wartime system, must be considered comprehensively for reasonable and effective distribution and production. Therefore, the central government has decided to adopt a material salary system. On one hand, this will ensure that general civil servants receive essential living materials from the government, shielding them from the impact of rising prices. On the other hand, the government will manage the distribution of materials reasonably and effectively.</p>
<p>However, given the significant nature of this matter, careful and thorough consideration and meticulous planning are required before implementation. The Executive Yuan meeting today has tasked relevant ministries with drafting implementation measures, which will be promulgated soon. The lives of general civil servants are expected to stabilize as a result.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Executive Yuan held its 157th meeting at 10:00 AM on the 13th, chaired by Premier Wang. Matters reported included: (1) The Premier's report regarding the proposal by Minister Gu of the Food Ministry at the 152nd meeting of the Executive Yuan to adopt a material salary system to provide relief for civil servants. In accordance with the resolution, Secretary-General Chen of the Executive Yuan submitted a review opinion. This was forwarded to the Central Political Committee, chaired by Mr. Chen, and presented to the temporary meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council on April 9th for discussion. The resolution stated, "Approved. The Executive Yuan's resolution, Articles 2 and 3, the six articles resulting from the review by various ministries and commissions, and the Ministry of Finance's outline for salt allocation are to be sent to the National Government for respective compliance. The Executive Yuan is to order the relevant ministries to draft detailed measures and supervise their implementation." After receiving the communication from the Secretariat of the Supreme National Defense Council, the ministries of Food, Finance, and Industry were instructed to draft detailed implementation measures for review and approval. After receiving the order from the National Government, the entire plan will be promulgated and followed.</p>
<p>Matters discussed included: (1) The Premier submitted a proposal from Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the establishment of a committee to take over the French concession. It was proposed to allocate 30,000 yuan per month, starting from April, for expenses, with actual expenditures reported. A budget estimate was attached for review and approval. The resolution was to task the Secretariat with convening meetings of the ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs for joint review and submission for approval. (2) The Premier submitted a draft of the "Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits" presented by Minister Luo of the Ministry of Judicial Administration for review and approval. The resolution was to submit it to the Central Political Committee.

<h3>Group Wedding Held by Muslims in Peiping</h3>
<p>Beijing, 13th (Central News Agency) - A group wedding for Muslims was held on the 12th at Huai Ren Hall in Zhongnanhai Park. A total of 26 couples participated, and a large number of people from all walks of life attended the ceremony. The wedding was conducted according to Islamic rites, with Zhao Guo Kuang, Chairman of the General Federation of Muslims, officiating. Afterwards, Mr. Zhao told reporters that the cost of Muslim weddings has always been quite high, ranging from two or three thousand yuan to as much as ten thousand yuan, which is a great waste. In this time of war, all Muslims should establish a new wartime system and practice thrift. The group wedding only charged a registration fee of twenty yuan, which is truly a new reform in our lives. Therefore, both old and new Muslims unanimously praised this and hope that Muslims will implement group weddings in the future to break old customs and promote the healthy development of the community.</p>

<h3>Center of Tunisian Battle Shifts Further Northeast: Axis Forces Withdraw from Sousse to Avoid Threat, Occupying New Defenses, More Consolidated Than Before</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a military correspondent from the Havas News Agency, the center of the Tunisian battle has now shifted further northeast. Over the weekend, fighting continued in the coastal plains of central Tunisia and the hills along its western border. However, after losing their strong positions, the Axis forces could no longer defend the southern plains and the vast, undefended central regions with their weak forces against the superior enemy forces attacking from two sides. Therefore, the task of the Axis command was to gradually retreat towards northeastern Tunisia, where the hilly terrain reaches the coast, making it more suitable for defense.</p>
<p>To carry out this operation, the Axis forces had to take steps to prevent the American Fifth Army and British reinforcements from advancing towards the coastal city of Sousse before the bulk of the German and Italian forces had withdrawn north of the Kairouan-Sousse line, evading the British Eighth Army. The Axis forces fought as they retreated. From Friday morning to Sunday evening, they successfully avoided this danger. The enemy used 250 tanks (a significant number in the context of Africa) and maximized the use of their superior infantry and artillery to gradually force the Axis forces out of several positions. However, their attempt to rapidly advance towards the coast was not realized.</p>
<p>If the American forces under General Patton had arrived in Sousse a day or two earlier than General Montgomery's troops, the German and Italian forces on the southern route fighting the British Eighth Army would have been surrounded. However, the American forces under General Patton only arrived in Kairouan on Sunday evening, not earlier than the vanguard of the British forces advancing from the south. By that time, the last rearguard of the German and Italian forces had retreated north of the Kairouan-Sousse line. This Axis rearguard force had a difficult task over the weekend, covering the retreat of the main forces in the area from the Sfax region to the north of Sousse, which was a laborious effort. At the same time, this rearguard had to repeatedly turn around and fight fiercely against the pursuing enemy, suffering losses.</p>
<p>In northern Tunisia, there were only localized attacks by the British First Army over the weekend, and the enemy did not achieve any noteworthy gains. Currently, in terms of the overall situation, the German and Italian forces have abandoned southern and central Tunisia, greatly shortening their defensive lines. The area now defended by the Axis forces is only about one-third of what it was before the British launched their large-scale attack on the Mareth Line. After shortening the defensive lines, the defending forces can concentrate their troops and make full use of the shortened internal communication lines to quickly and easily deploy their reserves to threatened areas. However, shortening the defensive lines also benefits the enemy, as they can concentrate their superior firepower on specific sectors. In summary, the strength of the two sides is still very disparate.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - Military experts say that the Axis position in Tunisia is becoming more and more consolidated as Marshal Rommel has completed his operation to keep his troops away from the enemy. The German and Italian forces are now concentrated in the new positions in the northeastern corner of Tunisia, taking advantage of all the benefits of the internal line, which is especially important in the difficult terrain of Africa. The supply of drinks, fuel, and armaments needed by the defenders is more than it was a few days ago, and the shape of the bridgehead of Tunis and Bizerte is especially favorable to the defenders. The mountain positions occupied by the Axis forces at the entrance to the valley of Mitterdjé allow the use of heavy weapons, so Rommel's withdrawal to the new positions has not resulted in any loss of soldiers or military supplies.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Active in Coastal Area, German and Italian Forces Deploy with Their Backs to the Sea</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to news from North Africa, the war situation in Tunisia has entered a decisive stage since the Axis forces retreated from Sousse and Kairouan. General Rommel is using mine warfare to the British Eighth Army, which is heading north along the coast from Sfax, and is trying to avoid major battles. Against the American forces in the Kairouan area, he is using clever tactics to carry out fierce attacks. At present, on the Tunisian front, the two armies are fighting west of Lake Kélibia. Air forces on both sides are very active in the coastal area. At the same time, the main force of the British First Army under Anderson on the northern front is divided into two teams, one advancing north from Mejez el Bab along the small stream towards northern Tunisia, the other advancing from Pont du Fahs along the Medjerda River towards southern Tunis. The Axis forces plan to join up with Rommel's forces in the northern coastal area of Tunisia, deploying with their backs to the sea to contain the main anti-Axis forces or to engage in a final decisive battle. It is also reported that the Axis forces are still continuously transporting new troops.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington, Davis, the head of the US Office of War Information, declared that the fighting in Tunisia has now shifted to the mountainous regions, and the task of the anti-Axis forces is gradually becoming more difficult. He said that the German and Italian forces are clearly determined to maintain the African bridgehead at any cost. He also stated that the Axis forces are preparing to replenish their troops in northern Tunisia.</p>
<p>Tangier, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Paul Baldwin, military correspondent for the New York Times, although Marshal Rommel is threatened by numerically superior anti-Axis forces in all directions, there is no sign that he intends to withdraw from North Africa. Correspondent Colin Hart of Columbia Broadcasting Company reported that Rommel's rearguard was retreating north of Sousse towards Enfidaville. The anti-Axis headquarters in North Africa announced that the field and supply stations in Kairouan had been completely destroyed by the Axis forces before their retreat. It is said that the British forces engaged in fierce combat with Italian tank forces twelve miles northwest of the city before occupying it. According to a Reuters correspondent, communication between the British First Army and General Montgomery's forces advancing in Sousse is extremely difficult. This is due to the systematic destruction carried out by the Axis rearguard and the deployment of landmines.</p>
<h3>Preparing for Summer Offensive: Germany Maintains Initiative, Soviet Attempt to Cross the Donets River Fails in Central Sector, German Forces Penetrate Soviet Lines in Leningrad Area</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - General Dietmar, a renowned German military commentator, explained the Eastern Front situation in a broadcast speech on the night of the 11th, saying the Soviet army did not easily announce the end of the winter offensive, which consumed a large number of manpower and material resources without achieving any results. In terms of viewing this from above, the Soviets appear very anxious. The German army does not underestimate the Soviet forces' ability to recover after the winter fighting. Both the German and Soviet armies are now engaged in preparations for launching the summer offensive. In this regard, the German army is completely maintaining the initiative. The German army gained valuable experience in the winter war and at the same time recognized the limits of the Soviet army's fighting power. This will greatly contribute to the German army's most victorious gains.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - The German official news agency announced last night that German reconnaissance patrols made progress in localized fighting in the Leningrad sector on Sunday, while Soviet attempts to cross the Donets River or approach the German lines in the central and northern sectors were repelled by the German forces. Due to the melting of ice and snow, large areas of the Eastern Front are muddy and flooded, preventing large-scale operations. The Soviet army is engaged in building dikes to establish communication lines, especially in the positions in the Kuban bridgehead and the Donets River region. German reconnaissance patrols in the Leningrad sector penetrated and attacked several Soviet positions, destroying many of their fortifications and outposts and incorporating the captured land into the German positions. Two Soviet attacks were repelled. The Soviet army attempted to cross the river again in the Izyum, Balakliya, and central Donets River regions but failed. In the central and northern sectors, the Soviet army attempted to approach the German lines in several places with armored vehicles and troops. German anti-tank heavy artillery and anti-aircraft batteries on the front lines were prepared and repelled them. On Sunday, German bombers continuously attacked the Soviet lines throughout the day, extending to the Novorossiysk region. German and Hungarian rapid bombers attacked many railway stations near the front lines, inflicting heavy damage, especially in the Kursk area. It is reported that five trains carrying troops and military supplies were destroyed. In addition, an oil station in Kursk was burned down. German fighter planes shot down a total of thirty-six Soviet planes.</p>
<h3>Stalin Receives Head of British Military Mission</h3>
<p>Moscow, 13th (Central News Agency) - Stalin received Lieutenant General Martel, the new head of the British military mission in the Soviet Union, yesterday. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Ambassador Sir Kerr were also present.</p>
<h3>German Camera Invention: New Lens Can Photograph Bullets in Flight</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - German engineers have created a camera that can expose in three millionths of a second. To achieve this, an extremely intense light source is needed. As a result, electric light has been found to be very suitable for this purpose. This new invention is especially important for photographing bullets in flight during wartime. The speed of a bullet is one thousand meters per second, so each millisecond can take three photos, which can reveal the air turbulence caused by the bullet's flight.</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister Cables German Leader, Expressing Extreme Satisfaction with Conference Results, Goebbels Says Axis Powers Have Entered New Phase</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - When Italian Prime Minister Mussolini left Germany, he cabled German leader Hitler, saying that he was extremely satisfied to have witnessed the sincere unity of the two countries in the war, continuing to fight to achieve final victory. Italian Foreign Minister Bastianini, who accompanied the Italian Prime Minister to the meeting, also cabled German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to express his gratitude.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to responsible sources here last night, the communiqué of the recent meeting between Hitler and Mussolini has become the focus of attention for Berlin political circles. The phrase "resolute struggle" is not merely empty words. The war potential from the Atlantic to the Donets River gives the Axis powers enormous advantages. Germany and Italy do not underestimate the enemy's strength, especially the great resources of the United States. However, the Axis powers have a great advantage in that they can draw on their own resources at any time, while the enemy still has a very difficult transportation problem to solve between the production areas and the front lines. The second half of the communiqué is particularly important because it refers to the post-war order, which has not been seen in previous communiqués. Especially because the result of British Prime Minister Eden's visit to the United States has left all post-war matters to be discussed in detail in the future, the opinion of people in Berlin is that it will be difficult for the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union to compromise with each other on this matter, which is in stark contrast to the complete consistency shown by the Axis side.</p>
<p>Rome, 13th (Central News Agency) - A special correspondent for the Havas News Agency here declared last night that the recent meeting between the Italian Prime Minister and the German leader has caused a great impression in Italy. It is believed here that the communiqué issued after the meeting is sufficient to prove that this meeting is extremely important for the formation of German and Italian policies. Sources familiar with the communication were aware of this meeting weeks before and had high expectations for it. They also recalled that the last meeting between the Italian Prime Minister and the German leader at the end of April last year led to the favorable development of the Axis powers' war in Africa and on the Eastern Front. Qualified political circles say that this meeting has achieved complete consensus on the general political situation and future strategy, and that two results should be noted: one is the decision to intensify the achievements of the war, and the other is a careful new definition of the Axis' ideal war aims. The Piccolo newspaper said yesterday that this meeting was not a "routine contact", and that the "important new tone" revealed in the communiqué was in line with the "firm situation reached by the war". The Messaggero newspaper also discussed intensifying the achievements of the war, saying that it would exceed all fantastic surprises and that the expected results must be achieved.</p>
<p>Rome, 13th (Central News Agency) - Goebbels wrote in the Italian newspaper yesterday, commenting on the recent meeting between the Italian Prime Minister and the German leader, saying that the Axis countries would have great new achievements. He said that the Axis countries, based on this discussion, will now enter a new phase, using all national forces for war. Now is not the time to announce the great plan to establish a new European order, but the Axis countries will plan to unite Europe both internationally and domestically, guaranteeing the free development of all countries, in order to counter the operational goals of the enemy in Africa and Europe.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Aizawa Returns to His Post</h3>
<p>Hanoi, 13th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Aizawa arrived here from Saigon at noon on the 13th. It is reported that the ambassador returned to his country at the end of last year and has been back for four months, and is now returning to his post.</p>
<h3>British Acknowledge Difficulty of Counter-Attacking in Burma</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army swiftly defeated Britain's attempt to retake Burma, in order to cover up the defeat and falsely claim that Jichun and others have now been occupied by the British army, the British army can now hinder the Japanese army's air base there. However, a Reuters telegram on the 12th still strongly stated that the counter-offensive in Burma was extremely difficult, and at the same time, it was said that the reopening of the Burma Road was only an optimistic observation, meaning that in order to retake Jichun, the cooperation of the army, navy, and air force was required, and more boats were needed. However, after the anti-Axis forces started this operation, the boats were in short supply, so it was impossible to carry out large-scale operations in Arakan. The results of this Arakan operation gave the US military the following experience: First, in order to retake Burma, it is necessary to gather a strong air force and fleet, and at the same time maintain contact between the various fronts. Second, during the initial operation, preparations for the next operation should be actively carried out, and the border area must be monitored by troops. Third, the valuable experience gained in the Arakan operation needs to be studied in order to develop new operational methods in preparation for the actual counter-offensive in Burma.</p>
<h3>Losses of British and American Merchant Ships Exceed 20 Million Tons</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to an announcement by the German military authorities, from September 1939 to March 1943, the United Kingdom and the United States lost a total of 30.4 million tons of merchant ships. This figure is roughly equivalent to the total tonnage of ships owned by the UK and the US at the start of the war.</p>
<p>Rome, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters announced on the 12th that the Axis forces' achievements from the 4th to the 10th were as follows: 1. 175 enemy aircraft were shot down, of which 104 were shot down in air combat and 71 were shot down by anti-aircraft fire. 2. In the Atlantic, one enemy destroyer was sunk, and German naval units sank two British fast boats in the English Channel. 3. 108,000 tons of enemy ships were sunk, of which 102,000 tons were sunk by German submarines in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, and 6,000 tons were sunk by Italian submarines in the Atlantic. 4. Five enemy ships were damaged.</p>
<h3>German Submarines Active, American Shipping Circles Panic</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, American shipping circles are panicking after learning that German submarines are again active off the east coast of the United States. An American magazine on February 1st also published information on the performance and tactics of German submarines, stating that the German Navy has recently deployed large, high-speed submarines in the Atlantic. The steel plates of these submarines are extremely thick and they can easily dive, and can also cruise underwater, making them difficult to sink with mines. Furthermore, the submarines often take group actions. When attacking convoys, two or three submarines approach the convoy first, launch torpedoes, and then quickly escape. If escort warships pursue these submarines, other submarines will then launch a fierce attack.</p>
<h3>Turkish Foreign Minister Invites Ambassadors from Various Countries to a Banquet</h3>
<p>Ankara, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Turkish Foreign Minister is scheduled to host a banquet tonight for ambassadors from the anti-Axis countries, including the ambassadors from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. On April 19th, he will host another banquet for diplomatic representatives from the Axis countries.</p>
<h3>British Air Ministry Announces Changes in Air Force Personnel</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch, the British Air Ministry announced yesterday that there will be changes in the command of the British Air Force. Air Marshal Drummond, Deputy Commander of the British Air Force in the Middle East, will become a member of the Aircrew Training Committee. Air Marshal Garrod, a member of that committee, will become Deputy Commander of the Indian Air Force. Sir Baldwin, who currently holds the position, will have a special mission. Air Chief Marshal Sir Wauchope will be appointed as the head of the British Air Force delegation in Washington.</p>
<h3>Indian Sergeant Recounts Recent Situation in India</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 13th (Central News Agency) - After being fiercely attacked by the Japanese army, the British Indian army on the western border of Burma has been defeated. There are many Indian soldiers in the British army who have repeatedly waited for an opportunity to escape. This time, taking advantage of the British army being attacked and in a state of chaos, they surrendered to the Japanese army one after another. The reporter specially visited Sergeant Harko Ansin of the British Indian Army's Punjab Regiment on the 12th. He stated that he and his comrades surrendered to the Japanese army on the 9th of last month in Rathedaung. His answers to the reporter's questions and his account of the recent situation within the British Indian Army and the current situation in India are recorded below: Question: What was your motive for surrendering? Answer: I have been in the military for more than ten years, but I never thought that we would be fighting Japan for the benefit of Britain. A few years ago, I followed Mr. Bose and later worked hard to promote his ideas. Question: Why did you join the military? Answer: After graduating from school, I could not find a job, which led to problems with my livelihood, so I joined the military. Most of my comrades were also forced by life. Question: What was the process of surrendering like? Answer: Before we escaped, twenty of our comrades had already escaped into the Japanese army's camp, so the British army was monitoring us very closely at that time. That night, we also escaped, first hiding in the forest, and the next morning we entered the Japanese army's position. Question: What is the morale of the Indian soldiers? Answer: It can be said that the soldiers have no morale or fighting spirit. Most of them will escape and surrender to the Japanese army whenever they have the opportunity. Question: What is the attitude of Indian soldiers towards the British army? Answer: In general, it is outward agreement but inward disagreement. Although we do not show it on the surface, we all resent it in our hearts. The British army treats us very harshly. The food and clothing are not as good as theirs. Even when we are deployed, the British army takes first-class carriages, while we take third-class carriages or freight cars. Question: Are the orders of the British effective? Answer: This is also only on the surface. In general, Indian soldiers believe that if we had weapons, we would definitely be stronger than the British, so everyone inwardly despises the British. Question: What do you think of the Japanese army? Answer: The Japanese army fights well, which is beyond expectations. I arrived at the front line on February 15th, so I did not directly build trenches or fight. It is amazing that the Japanese army crossed the natural barrier of Rakhaing Yoma. Before the fighting started, we mistakenly believed the British propaganda and thought that we might be able to recover Razabil, but after the fierce attack by the Japanese army, the British and Indian soldiers all suddenly woke up. We have long known about the Japanese army's preferential treatment of prisoners. Question: What is the atmosphere among the people in India? Answer: Most Indians hope that the Japanese army will enter India and help them fight for independence, but due to the lack of organization, they have not been able to start collective action. Although the Indian Governor-General's Office has recently actively suppressed speech and gatherings, the anti-British sentiment is still very strong. Question: What is the difference between the Indian independence movement before and after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War? Answer: The Indian independence movement has always been consistent, but after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the independence movement has become more intense. All Indians believe that the good opportunity for Indian independence has arrived. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo's statement in the Diet recognizing the independence of Burma has had a great impact on the Indian people's hearts. Question: What is the recent food situation in India? Answer: Due to the interruption of external sources and the forced purchases by the British army internally, the food of the people has become a serious problem. Australian flour has also not been shipped, and the price has increased threefold. We have not tasted sweets for a long time. Question: What are your hopes? Answer: I would very much like to tell my friends in the country the truth about Britain's deception, and I hope to tell my compatriots that today is really a good opportunity for the Japanese army to help India gain independence.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Soviet-Polish Border Dispute: The Soviet Union Firmly Rejects the Demands of Various Exile Governments in Eastern Europe</h3>
<p>British and American political work, centered on Eastern Europe and the Balkan countries, is very active amid the progress of the Soviet winter offensive. Various exile governments in Europe are also following suit, eagerly pursuing post-war settlement issues. Among them, the most prominent is the covert activity of the Polish exile government. After the Red Army's winter offensive was thwarted by the German army, and the German counter-offensive succeeded, Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky once again raised the issue of opening a second front. The conflict between the political primacy of the British and American sides and the military primacy of the Soviet Union became more acute. And the stone thrown by the Polish exile government in the Atlantic Charter caused cracks in the Atlantic Charter. The ripples gradually expanded, eventually alienating US-Soviet relations and unfolding significant consequences. The purpose of British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to Washington was to adjust the US-Soviet relations that had gone off track since the Stanley gaffe, and to discuss the attitude that the United Kingdom and the United States should take toward the border dispute between the Soviet Union and the Polish exile government. So what exactly is the truth about the Soviet-Polish border issue?</p>
<p>The Rebuilding of Poland Plan</p>
<p>The problem began when the leader of the Polish exile government brought the so-called "Rebuilding of Poland Plan" in his luggage when he crossed to America in late January. According to this plan, the post-war Poland would be larger than the pre-Soviet division, [redacted], [redacted], [redacted], [redacted].</p>
<p>At that time, the Red Army's winter offensive was in full swing. The British and American sides were extremely frightened of the spread of Soviet power in Europe, and were eager to reach a political understanding with the Soviet Union in this regard. The leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States did not hesitate to bow their heads and invite Soviet Supreme Defense Committee Chairman Stalin to attend the Casablanca Conference, but their wishes were not fulfilled. Their anxious state was expressed through the Polish exile government's probing of the Soviet Union. What is the room for the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Polish issue? This is the goal of attention from all parties.</p>
<p>The British and American news media were divided on this issue, with two factions. Voltaire Lee on the New York Tribune forum argued: "Scandinavia, Finland and the Baltic countries can be 'disposed of by the Soviet Union.'" But according to Constantine Brown on the Washington Star, "If the Soviet Union defeats the German army and gains the East Prussian area, Bulgaria and other countries will also join the Soviet Union Federation, and Yugoslavia will also enter the Great Slavic Russian League, and will give Russia an outlet to the Mediterranean."</p>
<p>Regarding these domestic British and American discussions and the covert activities of the Polish exile government, the Soviet Union expressed a firm denial attitude on February 8th in the "Pravda" newspaper by the TASS news agency. The demands of the Polish exile government deny the right to the unity of Ukrainians and Belarusians. The Polish exile government's policy of plunder exposes its imperialist ambitions. The demands of the Polish exile government were originally based on the Atlantic Charter, but the Soviet Union's interpretation of the Atlantic Charter, in its own attitude, stated: "Guarantee the right of all nations to determine their political organization as they please," so the Atlantic Charter is not a talisman supporting the Polish exile government."</p>
<p>This tough attitude of the Soviet Union terrified the Polish exile government, and all the exile governments in Eastern Europe were uneasy. The Soviet Union's ambition is not only to annex the former Polish territory, but also to annex the Balkan countries and West Asia. This terrifying observation made the United Kingdom and the United States feel that reaching a political understanding with the Soviet Union was a matter of urgency. Especially in the United States, due to the gaffe of the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley, the idea of distrusting the Soviet Union in the country has begun to rise. As a result, oversensitive speculation arose on the Soviet Union's interpretation of the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>The Limits of Soviet Justification</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the "Rebuilding of Poland Plan" proposed by the Polish exile government contains demands for the expansion of East Prussia, North Silesia, etc., beyond the pre-German-Soviet partitioned Polish territory. However, the Polish exile government's side argued that most of the areas causing the current disputes historically belonged to Poland, and that its residents were also Poles, especially the two major cities of Vilnius and Lviv, which are purely Polish cities in culture. The core of the problem is the Soviet Union's war aims and its claim to confine itself to its own territory, as Stalin himself said.</p>
<p>"We do not aim to occupy other people's territory or conquer other people's people as a war aim... Our primary goal is to take back our territory and our people from the German army."</p>
<p>But what scope do the territories and people mentioned in Stalin's declaration refer to? This has become a problem. In the order issued by Stalin on February 23rd, the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, he said:</p>
<p>"We are now starting the liberation war of Soviet Ukraine, where there are millions of Ukrainians, and even Belarusians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Moldavians, Crimeans, Galician peoples waiting for us to liberate."</p>
<p>The Soviet Union clearly regards these designated peoples and territories as its own territory and people. Therefore, not to mention the three Baltic countries, even Galicia and Bessarabia, as well as former Belarusian and Ukrainian peoples, if broadly interpreted, according to Stalin's law, all the territories and residents after the German-Finnish division are considered to belong to the Soviet Union. Therefore, whether the demands of the Polish exile government are opposed to the attitude of the Soviet Union is clear at a glance.</p>
<p>Britain Supports the Soviet Union Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>How can the Soviet Union's attitude be reconciled with the Atlantic Charter? The resolution of this problem will not only determine the fate of the Polish exile government, but also determine the fate of other exile governments in Eastern Europe, and even trigger flaws in the post-war settlement plans between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Now, the problem has already de facto caused flaws in the Atlantic Charter. Is the British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to America to mend these flaws, recognize the Soviet Union's attitude, and disregard the demands of the exile governments in Eastern Europe? Or accept the demands of the exile governments and make the Soviet Union withdraw from its camp. The United Kingdom and the United States are now standing at a crossroads, making it difficult for women. However, the United Kingdom, which adopts a realistic policy, now regards the exile government as a ghost, caters to the attitude of the Soviet Union, and attempts to adjust US-Soviet relations.

<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Explains Budget Contents in the House of Commons: Financial Difficulties Increase Due to Prolongation of War; Decision to Increase Taxes Again to Raise War Funds</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency) - Britain is deeply distressed due to the prolongation of the war and increased war expenses, which have caused a crisis of inflation. According to dispatches from London, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood explained in detail the contents of the last year's budget and the 1943-1944 budget in the House of Commons on the 12th. The main points are as follows: (1) The total expenditure for last year was £5,286 million, and the budget proposal for this year is set at £5,756 million, an increase of £470 million over last year. The actual expenditure of the budget may exceed this amount. The actual expenditure for last fiscal year reached £5,637 million, while the revenue was £2,819 million. (2) Since the beginning of the war, Britain has spent a total of £15.6 billion on war expenses. According to the 1940-1941 budget, the daily expenditure on war expenses was £5 million, which has increased to £12.6 million last year, and is now increasing to £15 million, which is three times more than the previous year. (3) Britain has shipped armaments worth £170 million to the Soviet Union. The armaments that Britain has received from the United States under the Lend-Lease Act are less than the amount of armaments that Britain has assisted to anti-Axis countries. Furthermore, Britain has allocated approximately £150 million for the construction of airfields, barracks, and hospitals for the US military stationed in Britain, and has spent £150 million for purchasing US armaments, etc. (4) In order to raise the huge war expenses for this year, Britain has decided to increase taxes again. Cigarettes that were formerly sold for one shilling and ten pieces will now be sold for one shilling and two pence. Beer (per pint) of one-eighth gallon will increase in price by one penny. Whisky will also increase by two shillings and four pence per bottle. In addition to the comprehensive tax increase on lottery tickets, the consumption tax will also be increased by another 10%. The new tax increase measures will take effect from the 13th. (5) Currently, Britain's exports have not only been drastically reduced to a quarter of what they were before the war, but the total amount of credit loans borrowed by various countries from Britain has also increased. The public bonds issued by Britain last year actually exceeded the planned amount. It is expected that the amount of public bonds issued this year will also exceed the planned amount. (6) The defense of India and its borders is almost entirely borne by Britain, so Britain's financial situation will become more and more difficult in the future.</p>

<h3>Children's Welfare Symposium (2) Hosted by This Newspaper's Social Service Department</h3>
<p>This article is a continuation from the fourth page of the April 10th edition. Due to a backlog of submissions in recent days, it could not be published continuously. It is now specially moved here for publication. - Editor's Note</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Bingnan: Now, the cost of living in Shanghai is soaring, and providing sustenance is difficult. Four groups of orphaned children have already moved to the countryside, namely the Youyou Nursery, the Shanghai Poor Children's Home, the Tai Jiabin Nursery, and the Tushanwan Orphanage. The air is better in the countryside, prices are lower, and there are agricultural tasks that can be used for production. However, these four groups all had the possibility of returning due to their conditions; other groups may find it difficult to do so. First, it is easier to raise funds in Shanghai; it is more difficult to raise funds if one moves to the countryside. Second, there is the issue of management; the committee feels that its reach is limited. Third, there is the economic problem; moving the venue requires expenses, and it is not easy to find houses in the interior. A group that moves to the countryside must prepare three months' worth of expenses.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruan Bin: The Youyou Nursery has already moved one hundred children to Xu Gongqiao. When relocating, everything was done independently, and the children even carried their own luggage, so it only cost five hundred yuan. The educational groups that have already moved to the countryside can make good use of their empty school buildings in Shanghai to run free elementary schools without providing sustenance, which would be easier in terms of finances. In this way, the benefits of moving the orphaned children to the countryside can be obtained, and at the same time, another part of the school-age children in the city who are out of school can also get the opportunity to study.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Haoyou: Regarding the nutrition of orphaned children, the Children's Protection Section of the Public Works Department has also conducted research. In short, it is necessary to provide the needs of orphaned children with scientific, minimum nutritional standards.</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao: Everyone hopes to be strong and live for decades. According to my research, it is not difficult to achieve this goal. The first is the issue of eating. Chinese people used to think that eating meat, chicken, and greasy food would definitely make people strong, but in fact, it is not the case. Eating meat can sometimes lead to poisoning, while eating vegetarian food can also make the body strong. There are many vitamins in vegetables, but they should not be cooked too thoroughly to avoid the loss of vitamins. Now rice is very expensive, so soy flour can be used as a substitute, which is extremely nutritious. Fruits contain the most vitamin C, but they are too expensive to eat, so red and white radishes can be used as substitutes, but they must be eaten raw. As for hygiene, (1) Fresh air: In the United States, there is a type of elementary school called "Forest School," which admits students who are physically weaker. From this, we can see that the outdoors is better than indoors. Orphaned children's schools should preferably have classes outdoors on sunny days, and wear hats in summer. At the very least, the classroom windows must be opened. (2) Deep breathing: Three times a day, 20 breaths each time. Continue this for one month, and the result will be a rosy complexion and a completely refreshed look. (3) Exposure to sunlight: This is sunbathing with the chest exposed, which is sun therapy. Sunlight is the greatest and free tonic for life. Even in winter, as long as the temperature is above 80 degrees, sunbathing with the chest exposed can be done outdoors.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Hefeng: Due to the location of the Tushanwan Orphanage, it is quite difficult to purchase food for the orphaned children. Therefore, seventy orphans were moved to Qingpu a month ago, but they were moved back recently due to management inconveniences. We hope that the authorities can allocate food for the orphaned children.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhong Zhigang: Orphaned children's educational groups can create a joint organization to jointly request allocations from the authorities.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Song: Food rice for orphaned children in the orphanage can be contacted with the Social Welfare Bureau on behalf of the orphanage, so that it can be allocated in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Zhengfan: The Shanghai Municipal Children's Day Preparatory Committee has requested Mayor Chen to provide convenience for the food rice for orphaned children in the orphanage, which has been approved. This is really good news for the orphaned children.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Yi: Voluntary workers cannot last long. They should be given a stable life with a reasonable salary if they are well-rounded in the four areas of education, incorruptible, have a plan, are willing to work hard, and follow public opinion. As long as the funding is available, raising orphaned children is not a problem, but what to do after raising them? It can be seen that the issue of education is extremely important. The education of orphaned children cannot be like that of ordinary elementary schools. They must be cultivated with the ability to be self-reliant from an early age. In the past, those who ran orphaned children's education often focused on production, but in my opinion, using production work as technical training for the lives of orphaned children is acceptable. However, it is impossible to rely on it for a living in the future. Therefore, the issue of education should be jointly studied by the orphaned children's groups to jointly research a new method to promote it. The Little Teacher System and Work-Study Groups created by Tao Xingzhi in the past were quite effective in cultivating children's ability to be self-reliant and can be imitated.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Boying: The education that various orphanages have given to orphaned children in the past has been slightly irrational. Each has its own strengths, but also has its own weaknesses. In the future, I hope that they can discuss together, learn from each other's strengths, and eliminate each other's weaknesses. The teaching time and years should be shortened, and ordinary textbooks are not suitable. It is best to compile them separately.</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao: The writing ability of orphaned children is mostly very poor, so they must be trained from an early age. The teacher writes on the blackboard, and the children copy it. At the same time, writing letters is also very important. This is very helpful for the future of orphaned children.</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Bingnan: To run childcare work, one must contribute money and effort. The workers are three in one, and the competence of the person in charge is even more important. The possible outlets for general orphanages that take in orphaned children can be divided into three periods according to their age: (1) From birth to six years old, their possible outlet is to be adopted; (2) From ten to thirteen years old, their possible outlet is to be an apprentice or trainee; (3) From thirteen to eighteen, they can take up general occupations, and girls can choose a spouse. If orphaned children's education focuses on education and care, but does not consider the outlet for orphaned children, it can be said that it can only save a part, but not all. At present, among the children who are adopted from the orphanage, some families are satisfied, but many are not. Therefore, there must be affection between teachers and students, such as students calling male teachers "dad" and female teachers "mom," etc., to inspire their natural inclination for family fun and cultivate their politeness. According to the survey, orphaned children who go out to be apprentices are far less popular than ordinary poor children. The reason is that ordinary poor families know the pain of life and the difficulty of finding a job, so they are willing to work hard. However, orphaned children do not have problems with eating and are more comfortable than poor families. After an orphaned child becomes an apprentice, he thinks that if the factory is dissatisfied with him, he can still return to the orphanage. Therefore, in order to remedy this shortcoming, the orphanage must investigate the living standards of apprentices in various factories to serve as a reference for daily training. Girls who will choose a spouse in the future must be trained in common sense and skills in household affairs.</p>
<p>Ms. Li Ruihua: Orphaned children are of different ages and genders. Their outlets can be divided into adoption, employment, spouse selection, and other types. Therefore, the guidance given should also be divided accordingly. For example, children who are prepared to be adopted should pay special attention to their politeness. Those who are employed should develop the habit of hard work. Girls who choose a spouse must have household skills such as cooking and sewing.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao Puchu: Orphanages must run light and easy handicrafts. Materials can be solicited from various educational groups or from society to meet the most immediate needs. Most of the industries are for children sent from prisons, with special emphasis on reforming their character.</p>
<p>Mr. Rong Boyun: During the schooling period of orphaned children, they must be made to work to cultivate their spirit of hard work. According to the method of the Tushanwan Orphanage, after children are over ten years old, they can see their affinity for work. The meticulous ones are made to learn delicate work, and vice versa, they do rougher work, such as carpentry and coppersmithing. At the same time, orphanages can also provide various labor production training according to different environments, such as the Tianping Agricultural Work-Study Group, which is close to the suburbs and can engage in agricultural production and manufacturing. Cultivate useful talents, so as to reduce social delinquents.</p>
<p>Ms. Zhu Yubao: It is difficult to provide sustenance for orphaned children. Adoption or sponsorship should be promoted. As for labor production, it often does not meet the actual needs of society. It is best for the orphanage to contact general factories. If there are light handicrafts, they can be distributed to the orphanage for work; or the factory can send technicians to the orphanage to train children, so that they can learn skills that meet the actual needs of the factory. In this way, children's production skills can be cultivated, and the outlet is also guaranteed.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Song: The Public Works Department has recently come up with concrete measures to deal with the problem of taking in beggars. The Public Works Department will allocate 1.5 million yuan, the Municipal Government will allocate 1 million yuan, and the French Concession Bureau will allocate 750,000 yuan as regular expenses, which will be entrusted to the World Red Cross Society to manage. The old site of the Caohejing Vagrant Training Center will be used to accommodate them, and it is expected that it will come to fruition soon. Homeless orphaned children are also included in the accommodation. This is indeed good news for the poor and helpless orphaned children on the streets.</p>
<p>Ms. Bian Xu: In this time of high cost of living, the income of ordinary working women is not enough to cover their expenses. After having children, they cannot work if they want to take care of their children, and they cannot take care of their children if they want to work. Therefore, the increase and improvement of nurseries is really needed. (End)</p>

<h3>Comprehensive Air Defense Drills to be Conducted Today and Tomorrow. Citizens and Air Defense Personnel Should Be Prepared at All Times. Three Air Raid Alarms on the Second Day of Yesterday's Independent Air Defense Drills.</h3>
<p>According to the regulations of the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters, the preliminary stage of this four-day continuous comprehensive air defense exercise, which started on the 12th, ended yesterday. During the period, independent air defense drills were conducted under the guidance of various civil guidance agencies. Today and tomorrow are called the later stage, and comprehensive air defense drills will be conducted. Each drill will begin after the alarm is issued, and its end or suspension will be ordered by special command. Therefore, unlike independent drills, comprehensive drills cannot give hints to relevant personnel or Baojia chiefs in advance for early preparation. Therefore, the authorities hope that all citizens of the city will be especially prepared at all times during these two days. Upon hearing the alarm, they should strictly abide by the various air defense and lighting control regulations and take necessary measures. In addition, the fire brigades, ambulance teams, engineering teams, and Baojia cadres under the administrative agencies of each district must all be ready and ready to be dispatched to work at any time. It is investigated that this air defense exercise fully demonstrates the determination of the military authorities to raise the people's air defense awareness and eliminate the threat of air raids. Therefore, residents must cooperate closely with the responsible departments. Those who violate the lighting control regulations will have their electricity supply cut off for a considerable period. If they spread rumors, shake people's hearts, and affect social order, they will be deported or punished according to law, to deter evildoers.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Second Day of Air Defense Drills</p>
<p>The city conducted another air defense drill, yesterday was the second day, and it was always in a state of alert. Therefore, all districts of the city were in a state of air defense, and warning ropes were still set up. The members of the self-defense corps were on duty all night the night before, and the ambulance team, fire brigade, lamp management team, security team, lookout, and liaison officer were also on duty in shifts. The situation was quite tense, and the order was very good. A total of three air raid alarms were issued throughout the day.</p>
<p>Early Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:00 AM, while everyone was asleep, an air raid alarm was issued. The self-defense corps were all dispatched to prohibit all kinds of vehicles from driving. Pedestrians were only allowed to walk along the street and keep to the left. The lamp management team was dispatched to the areas under their jurisdiction to strictly inspect the lights of the households. The ambulance and firefighters were all ready to be dispatched, preparing for various measures. The alarm was lifted at 6:30 AM, but the alert alarm continued to exist.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>The second air raid emergency alarm began at 2:30 PM. At that time, it was during the day. When the alarm sounded in all districts of the city, members of the self-defense corps were dispatched to implement traffic control and sent people to shake bells in the sections of the city to inform them and to display the air raid emergency alarm flags to assist in the work. The situation was good. At the same time, after sounding the alarm, the local army and navy air defense authorities in the city took off a simulated enemy aircraft to soar in the city's air and sent a fighter plane to follow. High-altitude takeoffs and landings were non-stop. The ground air defense forces also simulated firing anti-aircraft guns, and the sound of artillery fire was deafening, creating a realistic performance. The second emergency alarm was not lifted until 4:00 PM. In the air raid alarm, all districts of the city continued to practice firefighting, rescue, and evacuation.</p>
<p>Evening</p>
<p>The third air raid alarm began at 7:30 PM. All police, military police, and constitutions in all districts of the city were dispatched to take charge of traffic and lighting control. The lights on the roads in all districts were completely extinguished, and the lights in shops and households were completely covered. The whole city was in darkness. The Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters dispatched two aircraft to patrol back and forth in the city's air until 9:00 PM, when the alarm was lifted. Vehicles in various districts resumed driving, but only a few lights were turned on at various important intersections of lighting control after the alarm was lifted, and unnecessary street lights were completely extinguished. During the alarm period last night, citizens could still walk on the left side of the sidewalk, and the order was good. At the same time, various districts continued to hold various exercises in their respective districts last night.</p>
<p>Last night's Alert Lifted</p>
<p>The city conducted another air defense drill, which began with the issuing of an alert alarm at 8:00 AM on the 12th, and has never been lifted. Therefore, the city spent the night of the 12th in darkness until 10:30 PM last night, when the Air Defense Headquarters issued an order to lift the alert alarm. Then all the street lights and various lights in the city were lit up, restoring the original appearance of Greater Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Second Phase of Household Sugar and Oil to be Sold Simultaneously Starting Tomorrow. The Purchase Method Remains Unchanged. Raw Materials for Oil Extraction Continue to Arrive in Shanghai.</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the new method of providing sugar and oil, the phenomenon of sugar and oil panic in this city has gradually disappeared. The relevant parties are quite satisfied with the current provision system and believe that after the phenomenon of shortage existed in this city, the current method is the best one ever implemented.</p>
<p>Sugar</p>
<p>The second phase of sugar provision based on population will be implemented starting tomorrow (15th). The purchase method is the same as the first phase. Each person can purchase half a catty of sugar with the second sugar purchase certificate at a price of 2.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Oil</p>
<p>The sale of the second batch of edible oil will also begin simultaneously tomorrow. It will still be based on the house donation ticket and the head of household's household registration certificate. The provision amount will be determined according to the number of people in each household. Each person can purchase four taels of oil at a price of 2.55 yuan. In addition, the raw materials for oil production supplied to various oil extraction factories in this city have recently arrived in Shanghai. In addition to a large amount of cotton seeds that have arrived, it is said that 4,000 tons of soybeans have also arrived in Shanghai and have been distributed to various oil factories.</p>
<h3>Black Market Rice Prices Fall, People's Food Supply Becomes More Stable</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of food rationing in urban areas, the serious threat to people's food has been lifted. The recent decline in black market prices of rice has made the supply of people's food more stable. However, Baojia chiefs in various districts often rely on their power to repeatedly create malpractices in the distribution of rice tickets, directly depriving residents of their rights and indirectly undermining food administration, which is extremely hateful. The Municipal Food Bureau has separately punished the Baojia chiefs who committed fraud to rectify food administration. It is learned that Zhao Gensheng, the head of Qiujiazhai Township in the central area of the city, and Xu Duolang, the Baojia chief, have been removed from their posts by the district office upon the instructions of the Food Bureau to serve as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Widespread Vaccination to Begin Within the Week. Applying for Vaccination by Region. At Least Twice Per Person This Year.</h3>
<p>In view of the cholera epidemic in the summer of last year, the health authorities in various districts of this city have decided to hold epidemic prevention matters earlier this year. It is learned that the widespread vaccination will also begin within the next week, and the health departments of the two concessions have actively handled the prevention of malaria, scarlet fever, and other spring and summer epidemics since the first day of this month. Clogged ditches have been dredged by staff to prevent mosquitoes and other insects from breeding. The health inspectors have also stepped up inspections of vegetables and food on the streets and in the vegetable markets. Food that does not meet hygiene principles will be destroyed by the authorities. Within a week, the authorities will divide the residents of the city into regions and order them to apply for vaccination. Each resident will be required to be vaccinated at least twice this year and must carry a vaccination certificate at all times.</p>
<h3>Motorcycle Substitute Fuel to be Allocated in Early May</h3>
<p>The registration of motorcycles in various districts of this city has been completed. All vehicles with safe equipment have been issued new licenses by the authorities and are allowed to drive. The substitute fuel used by them will be fairly allocated by the Fu Bureau in early May. This substitute fuel has been tested by the authorities and is absolutely safe.</p>
<h3>Demolishing Houses and Selling Old Materials to be Strictly Prohibited</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Social Welfare Bureau recently discovered that some landlords are actually demolishing complete and like-new houses and selling all the wood, bricks, and tiles for profit. They are also selling the land at high prices, causing ordinary residents to be evicted. In order to safeguard the people's livelihood, the Municipal Welfare Bureau has decided to strictly prohibit it to serve as a warning to others. Those who deliberately violate the law will be dealt with.</p>
<h3>Goods Passing Through the Customs Branch Cards Pay Taxes Directly. Many Cases of Smuggling Have Been Seized Recently.</h3>
<p>Starting today, all local goods passing through the Xifenka branch card of the Suzhou River of the Jianghai Customs will pay the transit tax and Junpu donation in the general affairs section of the customs headquarters. All local goods passing through the branch card should directly pay the above-mentioned donation taxes at the branch card. In addition, the anti-smuggling section recently seized a large number of smuggled goods, including a used tire with voucher number 57658, Zhou Kunquan, all confiscated; a bag of mushrooms with voucher number 57655, Dashun Company, fined 50 yuan and paid back the transit tax; a bag of steel balls with voucher number 57292, all confiscated; four bags of seaweed with voucher number 57232, Ni Yunfang, fined 800 yuan and paid back the transit tax; seventeen pieces of straw hats and groceries with voucher number 57855, Chen Ci, fined 1,800 yuan. If the owners of the above-mentioned goods still seek to pay the fines within one month, the customs may confiscate the goods.</p>
<h3>Police Authorities in Urban Areas Clearing Pickpocketing Campaign</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the second clearing pickpocketing campaign by the Public Concession Police Department, the police authorities in the urban area, in order to ensure the safety of travelers and maintain local order, fear that general petty thieves have nowhere to set foot in the concession and sneak into the stations or wharfs in the urban area, and take the opportunity to use their skills to harm passengers. They have worked in cooperation with the concession police department to strictly arrest the pickpocketing gang and thoroughly search for the pickpocketing traces. Yesterday, they specifically ordered all branch offices to transfer to the subordinates to prevent and guard against them, and must pay attention to reconnaissance at all times to ensure the safety of the journey.</p>
<h3>Revising the Shanghai West Entertainment Tax</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau, according to the report of the Shanghai West Office, that Article 2 of the draft temporary rules for collecting the Shanghai West entertainment tax needs to be amended according to the actual situation in Shanghai West. It specially submitted opinions and requested for record. According to the report, the Finance Bureau has submitted to the Municipal Government Article 2 of the temporary rules for the entertainment tax and revised the entertainment tax rate to 20% of the ticket sales revenue. However, nightclubs and other places are not calculated based on tickets and should be collected 10% of the tourist bills.</p>

<h3>Essentials of Air Defense: Questions and Answers (1)</h3>
<p>Starting from the 12th of this month, Shanghai will hold four consecutive days of air defense training. Although air defense training has been carried out several times in the past, the general public's knowledge of air defense cannot be said to be complete. Therefore, a special air defense lecture is set up to answer all questions about air defense and popularize family air defense knowledge.</p>
<p>(Question) Some people still don't seem to fully understand the difference and handling of alert control, air raid control, and light control. Please explain in detail the difference and handling of alert alarms (daytime/nighttime) and air raid alarms (daytime/nighttime).</p>
<p>(Answer) As soon as an alert alarm is issued, immediately inform all family members to put on their air defense work clothes, fill the fire buckets with clean water, and move the fire prevention equipment to a fixed place. At the same time, move volatile oils, kerosene, and other flammable and dangerous goods to a designated storage place, tidy up the room, and pay attention to all flammables. After these preparations are completed, except for those specially designated by the group leader to perform tasks, those who have not been assigned work should remain calm as usual and continue working. During light alert control:</p>
<p>(1) All outdoor lights must be turned off, except for those designated or specially permitted by the responsible authorities. (2) Indoor lights must be reduced or covered, with the principle of not leaking light to the outside. (1) Cover windows and locations where light may be exposed. For every three square meters of indoor space, the light intensity should be reduced or covered to below ten candles. The size of the light should be determined according to the ratio of the indoor area, but the largest room should not use electric lights with more than fifty candles. Therefore, large rooms can use more than two electric lights. (2) In cases where the light is not covered, for every three square meters of indoor space, the light intensity should be reduced or covered to below one candle. The distance between the position of the light and the windows and doors should be more than 1.8 meters.</p>
<p>As soon as an air raid alarm is issued, first prevent fire, turn off the gas, and then check the water storage in the fire buckets to ensure they are filled with clean water. Then, turn off the main water valve and proceed with the following actions. All those engaged in air defense work must abide by the guidance and assignment of the group leader. The elderly, weak, and sick should take refuge in shelters or safe places inside the house. Cars and general vehicles should be parked in places that do not obstruct traffic. Ordinary pedestrians must abide by the guidance of supervisory agencies and self-defense team members and return home as quickly as possible. During light control, all outdoor lights, except for marker lights, must be turned off. However, lights that are necessary for work and have been specially permitted can still be used after being properly covered. Indoor lights must be reduced or covered in rooms where the light cannot be exposed. Places that cannot be covered must be turned off. (Continental New Daily, April 13)</p>
<h3>National Commercial Control Association Holds Reception for the Press Yesterday, Reports on Association Affairs and Future Prospects, The Press Raises Three Questions</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association has been established for a month. Yesterday afternoon, it held a reception for the local press at the International Hotel. More than 20 reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers attended. The association was represented by Chairman Tang Shoumin, Supervisor Wen Lanting, and senior staff. Chairman Tang delivered a speech, stating:</p>
<p>Chairman Tang's Speech</p>
<p>Today is the first formal reception for the press since the establishment of this association. We are honored by your presence and guidance. A written report has been prepared on all the work and tasks of this association. To save your valuable time, I will not repeat it. In addition, there are several points that require the research, promotion, and guidance of the press. I would like to take this opportunity to present them to you for your consideration:</p>
<p>(1) During this World War, the resources of various countries have been severely depleted. Most of the peacetime production forces must be engaged in military service. At the same time, the governments of various countries are focusing on military industrial production, which inevitably reduces general production. This is an inevitable fact. Therefore, whether during the war or after the end of the war, it is impossible to restore normal production and free trade in the shortest possible time. It is certain that a realistic control system will continue to be adopted. It is hoped that the press will conduct more research and promotion on the control system and its functions, so that people in society will pay attention and understand, which will also reduce public suffering in the future and reduce obstacles to the implementation of control work.</p>
<p>(2) Speculation and hoarding are unavoidable in any country when war breaks out. Now that a control mechanism has been established, it is hoped that the practice of speculation and hoarding can be eliminated. However, in my personal opinion, I still hope that all speculators can advocate from their conscience and resolutely stop all actions that hinder people's livelihood. The effect will be more powerful than any intervention. Regarding the government, first, I hope that it can actively promote production enterprises and guide idle funds into the right track. Second, I hope that it can strictly formulate laws and execute them fairly, so that the facts of speculation and hoarding will not occur, so as to avoid post-event remedies that cause suspicion and chaos.</p>
<p>(3) This association is a pioneering organization in China. There are no precedents and no experience. It is difficult to expect all measures to be thorough. Especially in terms of personnel, although we are committed to talent and careful selection, the number of people is large, and it is inevitable that there will be both virtuous and unworthy individuals. The press is the voice of society. I hope that you will stand in a supervisory position and adopt a monitoring approach to all colleagues at all levels of this association, regardless of who they are. If you hear anything, do not hesitate to criticize or directly question me. If there are facts to rely on, directly reveal them and make them public to society, so as to impose sanctions and make up for the shortcomings of personal vision. This is most welcome.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the operation of Allied powers' businesses in China, this association has suggested fair measures to the authorities. The government will soon promulgate protection laws, so there is no need to worry too much at present.</p>
<p>Written Report of the Commercial Control Association</p>
<p>The council and supervisors of this association were established on March 15. It has been more than two weeks since then. Here is a summary of the current situation and future prospects of this association:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the organizational aspect, the administrative departments of this association have been largely completed. Regarding the licensing office originally located in the Hamilton Building, fortunately, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce sent personnel to take over in advance. Now that the personnel arrangements of this association have been completed, we are negotiating with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for handover. As for the business departments, the organization of the industry associations has only recently been initiated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and initiators have been designated. This association plans to establish a specialized department for each industry as soon as each industry association is established, until it is gradually completed.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the connection between this association and the industry associations, this association was originally a commercial autonomous organization. Although the first council and supervisors were appointed by the government, its members are industry association members, and the members of the industry associations are local industry associations. According to the steps, the organization should be gradually organized from the bottom up. Although the general association was hastily formed due to time constraints, the mission of this association can only be smoothly promoted after the member organization is completed. According to the above-mentioned system, local industry associations should participate in the federation as members and do not have direct contact with this association. Now, some local industry associations have requested to organize local branches or mistakenly applied to this association for filing. They still misunderstand the prescribed system. This is specially explained for convenience.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the movement of goods, all goods within the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai are subject to the "Provisional Regulations on the Prohibition of Wartime Goods Movement" promulgated by the government, which details the scope of the prohibition. According to the regulations, the goods prohibited from movement are divided into two categories: 1. Twelve items that are transported out of the Shanghai control line. 2. Two items that are transported into the Shanghai control line. Both must be permitted by this association before they can be transported in and out. That is to say, the above fourteen items that are prohibited from movement can be moved freely within the Shanghai control line and between the two cities and three provinces without passing through the Shanghai control line without restriction. In addition, goods that are not subject to prohibition are, of course, even more unrestricted. Now that the laws and regulations have just been implemented or have not been widely known, misunderstandings and obstructions are inevitable. Local industry associations and merchants have sent letters requesting assistance. This association has telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to issue separate orders to the relevant authorities for investigation to relieve the difficulties of merchants.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the expected work of this association in the future, this time, the friendly country resolutely returned the control of goods to our country, which is very enthusiastic and admirable. Moreover, after the return, they still maintain a friendly spirit and sincerely assist, which should be thanked. This matter is of great importance to the people's livelihood. It is hoped that the friendly country and our industrial and commercial circles will assist this association in working together to achieve success. I believe that the meaning of control is not limited to allocation and permission. Its important work should be to seek the smooth flow of goods sources, increase production, and adjust supply and demand, so as to meet the distribution, and the prices can also be reasonably adjusted. This is what I especially desire. I will supervise and lead the colleagues of this association to promote it with the spirit of consistency from top to bottom, so as to live up to the expectations of all circles. Furthermore, I have been in the financial sector for more than 30 years and have never interrupted for a day. Now, I am entrusted with this important task by the government, and I dare not bear this heavy responsibility. Because I believe that this matter is beneficial to the people's livelihood and I cannot refuse, I will try my best to undertake it. Fortunately, all the gentlemen of the association are leaders of the society, and some are my predecessors. I hope that the general public can deeply understand the spirit of this control work. It is thanks to the continuous reminders of the gentlemen of the press that its effect will be even more powerful than government orders. As for all the measures of this association, in the future, we will also accept the instructions of the press at any time with great sincerity, so that this association can adopt the opinions of all parties to complete the task. Not only I am deeply grateful, but all the gentlemen of this association are also grateful.</p>
<p>Speech by a Representative of the Press</p>
<p>Chen Binhe, a representative of the press, stood up and spoke, stating: Since the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, it has not been a month, and the internal organization has been perfected. We are very pleased to be able to participate in this reception by your association. The work of the Commercial Control Association is the most difficult, and all the gentlemen who lead the work can endure hardship and are admirable to us. Since the Greater East Asia War, the control work has been presided over by the friendly Japanese side. In the past, many people did not understand the meaning of control work, and the friendly control authorities also lacked the opportunity to contact the Chinese private industrial and commercial circles. Both sides felt inconvenient. This time, the friendly Japanese side resolutely returned the control of goods to our country and entrusted it to the economic leaders Tang Shoumin, Wen Lanting, and others. I believe that from now on, the control work will be more convenient and smooth than in the past. In the past, we often criticized the government for its poor management. Now that it has been handed over to the people, then we must do it well. Mr. Tang Shoumin said just now that he asked the press to stand in a supervisory position. This remark seems too modest, but we do not want to shirk our responsibility. We are willing to stand in a cooperative position to convey the hopes and opinions of the people to the Commercial Control Association, and at the same time, convey the intentions and ambitions of the Commercial Control Association authorities to the people, so as to dredge the feelings of both sides. Not only our press circles, but also people from all walks of life are willing to work together to promote and assist the success of the control work. Finally, there are three points that I would like to ask Chairman Tang to answer within the possible scope: First, when can the organization of the industry associations be completed? Second, when can the control mechanism under the jurisdiction of the工部局 be handed over? Third, why should cotton yarn and cotton cloth be treated specially?</p>
<p>Tang's Answers to the Three Points</p>
<p>Chairman Tang stood up to reply, stating: Mr. Chen, the three points you asked will be answered as follows: First, this association has been established since March 15, which is less than a month. At the beginning of the founding, we devoted ourselves to the organization of the internal mechanism. The current work situation can be divided into two parts: one is the administrative department, which has been largely completed, and the other is the business department, which is the organization of the industry associations. This matter is currently being conducted by the competent authority, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It is expected to be completed by the end of this month at the latest. Second, the control matters handled by the 工部局 will not be suspended due to the establishment of this association. Other agencies, such as the Municipal Government and the French Municipal Council, will also continue to handle a part of the control work. This association has close contact with the above three agencies, so there is no so-called handover. Third, cotton yarn and cloth are not treated specially. Cotton yarn and cloth are one of the important materials. Registration was previously handled, but because the government believes that the market price of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Shanghai is too high, it has ordered a thorough investigation of the cause. Therefore, even the registered cotton yarn and cotton cloth cannot be moved temporarily. However, this association is eager for the government to find out the truth as soon as possible, so it has suggested a method to the government, hoping to get free movement as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Economic Circles</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market: Xin Xin Ye Tea Company ordered more than 60 boxes of tea hearts from the Zhi Ji Tea Company. The market atmosphere was firm and elegant. The first batch of new Longjing tea, more than ten pounds, has arrived in Shanghai, with a very high asking price.</p>
<h3>Commentary: Thoughts on Thoroughly Investigating Speculation and Hoarding</h3>
<p>The most touching news recently is the order issued by the National Government on the 7th of this month to thoroughly investigate the speculation and hoarding of important materials by the main staff of Shanghai's financial institutions.</p>
<p>On the 8th of this month, the black market prices of various important materials in Shanghai plummeted. Originally, the rise in the black market prices of many materials in Shanghai in the past was mostly due to artificial factors. Therefore, to prescribe the right medicine, the administrative authorities responsible for stabilizing people's livelihood must also use artificial means to lower them.</p>
<p>The ancient books say: "What the people like, like; what the people hate, hate." The people are the largest majority of the common people. What the common people like best is low prices and stable life, and what they hate most is high prices and difficult life. Therefore, the common people hate speculation and hoarding, and those who raise prices high. Now the government hates them too, and orders a thorough investigation, which can be said to be able to follow what the people hate.</p>
<p>Some say that Sima Qian said: "The world is bustling, all for profit; the world is hustling, all for profit." It can be seen that all kinds of people in society are for profit. Those speculators and hoarders are just among the bustling, why should they be deeply blamed? The reporter believes that this statement is wrong, because what Shi Gong said refers to ordinary livelihood earners who benefit both people, not those who have blackened their conscience, fatten themselves at the expense of others, laugh when others cry, live when others die, and desperately make a fortune from the national crisis. Mencius said: "The heart of compassion is possessed by everyone." Unexpectedly, those who speculate and hoard and make a fortune from the national crisis are an exception. This is not only being blinded by profit, but also blackening the heart.</p>
<p>The country must punish those who have already been blinded by profit and blackened their hearts after they are found out. For those who have not yet been blinded by profit and blackened their hearts, they must also advocate the noble philosophy of life in which gentlemen take righteousness as profit. Although the country must focus on material things for the sake of strengthening national defense, the people must focus on the spirit for the sake of their own benefit, and take virtue as wealth. With the combination of the rule of law and the rule of virtue, the current difficult situation can be overcome.</p>
<h3>Guidance from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce: Organizing Industry Associations</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: In order to implement wartime economic policies, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has decided to adjust or reorganize various existing economic institutions that are not suitable for the wartime system. It has formulated the Provisional Regulations on Industry and Commerce Associations, which were promulgated on March 25 this year, and the Law on Industry and Commerce Associations was repealed. Since then, the industry and commerce associations in various places have become wartime economic institutions. Their purpose of establishment is different from the past, and their responsibilities are also heavy. Their organization should be sound. Therefore, a special整理委員會 is set up to guide their organization. The整理委員會 has been meeting in Shanghai for days, and the organizational procedures of the major commodity associations and federations have been largely determined. The Ministry will announce them within days, and the industry federations will be the upper-level organizations of the industry associations. They should be organized and established as soon as possible. It is reported that the first batch of federations to be established are: (1) Cotton Industry Federation, (2) Cotton Products Industry Federation, (3) Match Industry Federation, (4) Soap and Candle Industry Federation, (5) Tobacco Industry Federation. The remaining industry federations will also be guided and organized successively in the near future. In addition, the initiators of the industry federations are approved or designated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce according to law. Except that the initiators of the Cotton Products Industry Federation have been designated by the Ministry to start preparing for the organization, and the initiators of the Cotton Industry Federation are still being carefully selected and will be announced separately, the initiators of the other Match, Soap and Candle, and Tobacco Industry Federations have also been designated by the Ministry. The list of initiators of the above federations is as follows:</p>

<h3>Thorough Investigation of Speculation and Hoarding in Shanghai Already Shows Clues; Han Gongbei Severely Punishes Futong Bank by Suspending Operations; The National Government Issued a Clear Order Yesterday to Comply</h3>
<p>National Government Order (April 13, 32nd Year): According to the report from Chen Zhishuo, Minister of Finance, and others, regarding the thorough investigation of the speculation and hoarding of important materials in Shanghai, it has been found that Han Gongbei used the unregistered Zhenhua Company to purchase large quantities of important materials and disrupt the market. There is conclusive evidence. He is ordered to be arrested and sent to the court for severe punishment. Zao Tong Bank is suspected of major crimes and is ordered by the Ministry of Finance to suspend operations temporarily and send personnel to thoroughly investigate. The rights and interests of its depositors should be properly protected without any loss to show the government's concern for the people. Other matters of strictly investigating rice are ordered to be continued by the competent department to ensure that unscrupulous merchants know how to restrain themselves and that prices can tend to be level. There are high hopes for this, this order.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Formulates Procedures for Industry Associations to Apply for Organization</h3>

<h3>Food Ministry Consults with the Ministry of Construction to Crack Down on Private Transportation of Rice</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th, Central News Agency: The Food Ministry recently stated that some Chinese and Japanese merchants misunderstand that materials in the interior are free to circulate, and rice is also among them, which has led to the trend of private transportation, which has a huge impact on rice control. Therefore, in addition to issuing and ordering strict investigation and handling, the management area table for the sale of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has been attached and consulted with the Ministry of Construction for verification and forwarding to all ship and land transportation agencies. In the future, the Ministry will issue transportation certificates for transporting rice, and it is hoped that they will assist in cracking down on illegal transportation to maintain the political order.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Control Association Expands its Organization and Establishes Specialized Committees. The Office of the Japanese Embassy will Hand Over the Affairs of Material Movement Permits.</h3>

Yesterday, it was learned that in addition to the original general affairs, review, materials, and finance departments, the association has also added specialized committees for each industry to handle the specialized affairs of each industry.</p>
<p>It was also learned that since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association on March 16, the office of the Japanese Embassy transferred the procedures for the transportation of materials. Because the various procedures could not be completed at one time, a part of the staff was retained to give instructions on everything. Now that the organization of the Commercial Control Association is becoming more and more perfect, the procedures for the transportation of various materials will be transferred to the association at the beginning of next week.</p>

<h3>Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>Some say: human desires are never satisfied. People with millions upon millions in assets, aren't they still racking their brains and squeezing themselves into the eye of the money? The chasm of desire is indeed difficult to fill.</p>
<p>Contentment can bring lasting joy, but in the real world, who is that contented fool?</p>
<p>What we see with our eyes, hear with our ears, and read in the newspapers are all messages of dissatisfaction. "Dissatisfaction with life," "dissatisfaction with the spirit," "dissatisfaction with career." Everything is "dissatisfaction." "Dissatisfaction" has almost become a fashionable disease in the world.</p>
<p>Writing articles must involve writing about "dissatisfied" women; speaking must also involve speaking of "dissatisfaction." Otherwise, it's unfitting for the times. And truly, the present era is not a satisfying one, it is an era that is far too disappointing!</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, "dissatisfaction" is actually a phenomenon of human evolution, because: their "dissatisfaction" with the real world must mean that they have discovered the shortcomings of the world, and at the same time, they must have a kind of beautiful aspiration in their ideals.</p>
<p>Therefore, "dissatisfaction" should also be a kind of ambition inherent in mankind that is worthy of praise because since it feels dissatisfied with reality, it must be harboring a beautiful transformation in its ideals. But, if it can only feel "dissatisfaction" without thinking about transformation, then this kind of "dissatisfaction" is a futile intuition.</p>
<p>Feeling "dissatisfied" and deliberately intending to improve is a beautiful virtue of mankind.</p>
<p>If our human ancestors of thousands of years ago were only "dissatisfied" with their then real environment without improving it, then we would still be lingering in a life environment of eating raw meat and drinking blood.</p>
<p>Therefore, human "dissatisfaction" is not a kind of insatiable inferiority. But you must remember that "dissatisfaction" cannot bring you satisfaction just by waving a pen or singing high-sounding tunes; it should be improved through your own efforts.</p>
<p>Everything in the present world and present society is indeed so unsatisfying to us, but why can't we transform it sharply? Look, aren't there already some progressives sacrificing their real blood to create a path forward for us? Then we should follow their bloodstains and walk into our long-idealized, satisfying world!</p>
<h3>February Essay Contest 6th Place: How to Read Books? What Books to Read?</h3>
<p>— Mei Zhicun</p>
<p>Our purpose in seeking knowledge is to learn the principles of being human, life skills, and to increase the happiness of mankind. One of the ways to achieve this goal is to read books. Of course, we can gain more profound and practical experiences and knowledge from daily life than from books. However, this kind of knowledge gained from direct observation and personal experience is ultimately limited and requires a lot of effort. Books are a treasure trove of systematically organized records of all human experience and knowledge. What they convey is the most extensive, and learning is relatively economical and straightforward. Modern world civilization is advancing rapidly, and there are really too many books to read. Under these circumstances, to achieve real results in reading, one must focus on economy and research.</p>
<p>The economy of reading is nothing more than energy economy and time economy. To achieve this goal, one must understand the principles of reading, possess the elements of driving and carrying it out, and implement scientific methods.</p>
<p>(1) Principles - "Precision" and "Extensiveness" are the two major principles of reading. People of ancient and modern times who have discussed reading, some advocate specialization, some advocate extensive knowledge, all are talks based on experience. However, "being precise without being extensive leads to pedantry, and being extensive without being precise leads to superficiality." Being biased toward one is not acceptable. If one reads whatever book one is interested in and studies whatever knowledge, the result is a small understanding of everything, and nothing is useful. However, correcting the wrong by going too far, only reading one subject and not reading anything else; in this way, although one avoids drilling into a dead end, one becomes pedantic and inflexible. Knowledge is common and interconnected. If one does not have general knowledge of other departments, sitting in a well and looking at the sky, one will not know how much value one's research has for mankind, what position it occupies, and what work one should do. The result is becoming a bookworm who is disconnected from the real society. What use is that? Therefore, in order to learn for application, we must specialize in one subject—what you love to read—and we must also have extensive knowledge of other basic knowledge.</p>
<p>Elements—Reading is originally a mental activity. If there is no driving force to promote it and no driving force that is directional, lasting, and unchanging; then it is easily affected by external stimuli and distractions, and one is prone to changing direction or giving up halfway. What is the driving force? Parents' teachings, teachers' supervision, no, none of these. The true driving force is interest, and what is the driving force? Perseverance, determination, and an enterprising spirit, a healthy body, the needs of life, and social appreciation are all supporting the driving force of reading. In other words, interest, perseverance, determination, and an enterprising spirit, and a healthy body are essential elements for reading; these are all related to personal cultivation and need to be cultivated and exercised especially.</p>
<p>(3) Methods—Since reading has established principles and has the motivation, how can one put it into practice to get real results and the greatest effect? This requires the use of scientific methods. In short, a scientific method is a systematic and planned method. Subjecting the knowledge in the books we read to a systematic review step by step, studying them by category, and selectively absorbing and applying their essence.</p>
<p>(A) Methods of Principles: (1) Analysis (2) Induction (3) Comparison (4) Observation (5) Reasoning (6) Hypothesis (7) Application</p>
<p>(B) Methods of Techniques: (1) Understanding (2) Memory (3) Silent Reading (4) Recitation (5) Quiet Contemplation (6) Note-taking (7) Practice (8) Questioning</p>
<p>When using reading methods, one must also pay attention to the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) Various academic disciplines have their unique points, and reading methods are nothing more than the above. However, which ones to adopt and how to allocate and apply them must be able to adapt to changes and adapt to circumstances.—Living application.</p>
<p>(2) We must allocate our reading time appropriately and reasonably and make full use of it in order to obtain the greatest effect with the least effort. For example, reading in the morning when one's mind is most refreshed will naturally produce greater efficiency.</p>
<p>(3) Obtain a reading environment—pay attention to air, light, quiet, etc., to be as appropriate as possible.</p>

<h3>Root</h3>
<p>— Xinbo</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" Da Gen shook his body and shook Hu Gen's hand away. However, Da Gen didn't leave, he just stayed there. In a moment, although he didn't go up to meet them, the center of the fight came over. He found that all around him were fighting people.</p>
<p>"It's that little bastard! It's that little bastard!" A pockmarked man, cursing, ran towards Hu Gen. By the time Hu Gen wanted to defend himself, he had already taken a punch on the shoulder blade and fell to the ground, unable to bear it.</p>
<p>"Hah, you bully children!" The pockmarked man wanted to hit Hu Gen on the ground again, Da Gen shouted, and punched him on the shoulder blade as well. He staggered a few steps and sat on the ground.</p>
<p>The pockmarked man's gang, people from Shanbei, relied on their numbers and rushed towards Da Gen together.</p>
<p>"A Hu, get away quickly!" Da Gen, while parrying, protected Hu Gen, who had already gotten up from the ground, and gradually retreated.</p>
<p>The Shanbei people couldn't withstand Da Gen's fists, so although there were many of them, they didn't dare to get too close and fight face-to-face. They just wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to throw cold punches from behind. However, they were still shouting "Beat these bastards to death!" to show their power.</p>
<p>Hu Gen took advantage of an opportunity to get out and shouted all the way: "The Shanbei people are beating the Shannan people, the Shannan people go up quickly!" He called for reinforcements everywhere.</p>
<p>Da Gen retreated to the edge of a high mound. He stood on the mound, clenched his fists, glared at the people around him. Whoever wanted to come up, he would deal with whoever, and whoever really rushed up, he would step down and punch him back. After hitting a few, no one dared to really rush up, at most only rushing to a height of a large half, where Da Gen's fist couldn't reach him, and then hurriedly retreated. Over time, the real fighting between adults turned into an intentional game between children. However, they still surrounded him and did not disperse, as if surrounding a city, waiting for the people in the city to be exhausted and naturally submit. (30)</p>
<p>Scientific Essays</p>
<h3>Why Can You Move Freely?</h3>
<p>— Li Sisui</p>
<p>Someone asked you, "How do you know up and down?" The answer is difficult, most people say, "It's an innate function." But this answer is not scientific enough. When you stand upright, you will know that the head is up, and when you swim and dive, you will know that the head is down. Why can't you get it wrong?</p>
<p>Inside your ear, there is a rubber bag filled with oil and some small limestone. The inner edge of the bag is covered with fine hairs connected to the nervous system. When you stand upright on the ground, due to the earth's gravity, small limestone stones gather at the lower end of the rubber bag, the fine hairs are under pressure, and the nervous system immediately tells you that your head is up. If you sleep in bed, small limestone stones gather on the side of the bag, similarly telling you the direction. This rubber bag that can generate mechanical action is commonly called the otolith.</p>
<p>"Ah, so that's how it is, who doesn't know it!" But, friend! Don't underestimate it. If the fine hairs in the otolith lose their function, you will also be unable to distinguish up and down.</p>
<p>The reason why fish don't turn over when swimming in the water is also due to these effects. If you don't believe it, you can do an experiment yourself. Take sand and stones in the fish tank and replace them with very fine iron sand. The fish can still know the direction. If you tie a magnet to both sides of the fish and put it back in the tank. The iron sand quickly gathers on both sides of the fish, and the fish loses the ability to distinguish direction, or the nervous system is destroyed, and it becomes a sacrifice for your experiment.</p>
<p>After you know the directions of up, down, left, and right, how do you know to go up and go down? After the ear nerve tells you where the top is, the nerve center immediately orders your hands and feet to move your body upward. Who is the mailman? Where is the order delivered? All information is carried to the joints and muscles by the "Kinaesthetie" nerve. The transmission route is the main nerve system next to the spinal cord. If syphilis invades this part, the entire "Kinaesthetie" nerve bears the brunt, and the hands and feet are therefore separated from the command headquarters. Paralysis or stroke appears. Such people cannot walk straight, which is what we often call shuffling. If you tie his feet together, he will not be able to move. This is a "lymphatic" symptom. Because the "Kinaesthetie" nerve can no longer bring information from the brain to the muscles and joints. Broken bones and serious nerve damage can also produce this terrible result.</p>
<p>It is a miracle that people who are suffering from this disease can still go up and down stairs freely, although it is the most common thing in the eyes of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Friend, now you know why you can move freely?</p>
<h3>The Truth and Falsehood of Humility</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>Genuine humility is the expression of the best characteristics of mankind, the product of "calmness" and "frankness." True humility is not arrogant, it is upright and honest, it acknowledges that its limited abilities and thoughts cannot solve all the problems in the world, but it does not become depressed because of it; on the surface, it can be humble, but inside it knows that in this vast world it has its own place and plan, although its abilities are limited and its mind is weak, it still has to study bravely and perseveringly for a long time, expand its share of strength, and whatever achievement is a reward, but never exaggerate... This kind of "active" humility is like a lily that grows low, although it is humble in appearance, it is still a sacred and noble flower, releasing a fragrant aroma.</p>
<p>Of course, what we need is this kind of "humility."</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, we have discovered counterfeit humility. There is already a kind of false humility existing in the hearts of some people.</p>
<p>False humility, to put it bluntly, is worse than boasting and arrogance. Boasting and arrogance have frankness in them, because it is a straightforward admission of selfishness, although it is a vice, it can make others wary of him, unable to deceive others, because the result of arrogance and boasting is that he himself suffers, which has nothing to do with others, but false humility is different...</p>
<p>False humility is a vice that deceives oneself and others, wearing a mask, others cannot but be deceived, and when he walks in front of the mirror, he himself is also deceived; but what exactly is false humility? Open your wise eyes, and you can experience encountering this kind of hypocrite.</p>
<p>For example, there are some people who really have the ability to help others, to help people in society who are suffering, but they "humbly" say: "I really don't have the ability!" But I dare say that there is no one in the world who cannot help others in the slightest.</p>
<p>There are even some people who are harmed by false humility all their lives. Clearly, they could have the ability to do some kind of career, but they are thinking, "Forget it, do I have this ability?" When others hand him an obligation, he also says: "Alas! I am a pitiful person with no ability to bind a chicken! Please go find someone else!"... We can imagine what the consequences of such a person should be!</p>
<p>Therefore, when we are being humble, we should ask ourselves whether this humility is necessary? True? False? Never bury yourself and deceive others, otherwise, it's too bad! And too terrible!</p>
<h3>Today</h3>
<p>— Dan Ruo</p>
<p>"What should be done today, finish it today" is a very common motto. Although the world understands the true meaning of this motto, it is indeed a golden rule for dealing with people and affairs, but most people do not have the perseverance to implement it, so they lose opportunities, miss reality, and many careers fail.</p>
<p>We must know that today is today, right before our eyes, it is real. Why should we miss such an opportunity? Although after today, there is tomorrow, but tomorrow is imagined, it is empty, and besides, tomorrow has its own affairs. If today's affairs are not finished today, at least tomorrow's affairs will also suffer considerable erosion! Since today is right before our eyes, we must resolutely grab it firmly, make full use of it, and never waste it! Everyone should ask themselves—the meal that should be eaten today, can it not be eaten today and wait until tomorrow to eat it? Then why wait until tomorrow to do what should be done today?</p>

<h3>This Newspaper Cooperates With Various Hospitals to Prepare for Expanding the Vaccination Campaign</h3>
<p>The weather has suddenly warmed up in recent days, especially at noon, and everything presents an early summer scene. If judged by the solar terms, it is actually abnormal. Therefore, citizens should try their best to take care of themselves in terms of clothing, food, and housing. Because under this kind of temperature, if they are slightly exposed to cold, they are prone to influenza. Recently, the number of patients with throat problems has increased, which is the reason. As for vaccination against smallpox, it is a kind of preventive treatment. For the sake of their own health, citizens should automatically carry out vaccination. Although smallpox has not yet appeared, it is still necessary to get vaccinated against smallpox. The need for a vaccination certificate can be determined according to individual circumstances, but getting vaccinated is necessary for personal health and social welfare. This newspaper has cooperated with various hospitals to prepare for expanding the vaccination campaign. At the same time, the police and health departments will also inspect vaccination certificates of passengers traveling to and from this city and other places. Therefore, we hope that citizens will automatically get vaccinated together. In this period of high medical costs, preventing diseases before they occur should be emphasized by every citizen. The health authorities will soon be forcibly vaccinating and injecting in the streets or from door to door, so we hope that citizens will go ahead and get vaccinated as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Preferential Treatment for Teachers in Various Hospitals</h3>
<p>(1) In order to give preferential treatment to poor and sick primary school teachers, the Southeast Hospital has specially added a clinic department from the first of this month. Those who go to the clinic from 8:00 am to 10:00 am every day will be exempt from the registration fee and consultation fee, and will also reduce drug costs and material costs. The hospital address is No. 299 Saposai Road, French Concession. (2) Mr. Jin Yinggeng, a world-renowned doctor from Nanhui, responded to this newspaper's medical assistance fund for primary school teachers. It is stipulated that from the first of this month, sick teachers who have a certificate from the school can receive free medical treatment at No. 43, Chongan Lane, Haifang Road, and provide medical treatment in the hygiene hall at the intersection of Aiwanyi Road and Jiaozhou Road from 1 to 2 pm every day, and no registration fee will be charged. (3) Tao Gengyu, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, specializes in internal medicine and gynecology and has been practicing medicine for 20 years. In order to respond to the medical assistance fund for primary school teachers, he was introduced by your newspaper and proved to be a diligent and poor scholar. He can receive free medical treatment. The outpatient hours are from 10 am to 3 pm. For house calls after hours, the doctor's residence is in Yongyu Lane, Jule Road, French Concession.</p>
