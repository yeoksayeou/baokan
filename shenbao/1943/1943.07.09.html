<p>社評</p>
<h3>獻言於友邦日本經濟使節團</h3>
<p>友邦日本經濟使節團一行，前日抵滬，即將與各方交換意見，我國朝野，莫不表示衷心的歡迎與極大的期待。因爲中日向爲兄弟之邦，近來在大東亞解放戰爭中，更有休戚相北的親密關係，無論政治經濟任何方面的好惡，都足以影響到對方，所以，在友邦經濟使節方面，旣來中國，自然不能只從表面的部分的或文字言論上用功夫，而要切切實實的去　察種種現實，同時，在我國朝野，尤其不應稍存諱疾忌醫的心理，必須說老實話，以眞相示友邦使節，務使不負其遠道僕僕的盛意。也正因爲如此，我們昨天曾就我國目前經濟病况，擇其大要，一一列陳，說者實話，以表忠忱，爲期中日經濟眞正的提携，我們這種誠意，一定爲大家所了解的。我們今天更懇摯地指出，我國這種經濟的病象已經很深，兩國朝野，如不及早妥謀補救之策，則前途危機嚴重，對於中國，對於友邦，對於整個大東亞解放事業，都有嚴重的後果。</p>
<p>但是，徒知病家與病况，而不査究其病源，則補救工作，不免蹈於空虛，或者事倍而功未及其半。至於我國和平區內經濟病根所在，老實說，是與政治不可分離的，政治的病是因，經濟的病是果，因此，要救經濟的病，就必須首先—至少須同時救治政治的病，否則，終不免徒勞無功。今日中國經濟之病，最大的根因，是中國政治不上軌道，政治不健全，一部分領導的人一負人望。在政綱政策方面，近數十年來，不無跟着外國的政策跑，根木沒有適應本國國情與人民實際需要的，因此，隨波逐流，朝令夕改。同時，從政的人，也是這樣走馬燈一般的團團轉，彼去此來，虛應故事，沒有認眞切實有辦法有事做，而且實際上也不可能，結果，在中國形成政治的不健全，影響到經濟的病態，而在幕後支配的外國勢力，祇在表面上在中國取得某種限度某種形態的半殖民地性的「權益」，這種權益大抵是片面的，局部的，暫時的，對於國際遠大的前途的利益，絲毫說不上，當另一國際勢力抬頭之時，就有被逼完全退却的危險。如今日之英美，可爲明顯的例子，他們不知幫助改善中國政治，爭取人心，樹立國交的基礎的惡果，正是我們今日的敎訓。</p>
<p>中國經濟最受政治影響而病態的，除了上述之外，就是政治機構職權的不統一，歷史上的例子不必多舉，單就不久過去的事實而言，與經濟有關的政治機關及統制機構的職權，也是不統一不明朗的，日本方面與中國當局問形成重複，以及中國本身機構之重複，又是司空慣見的事，於是，經濟界與一般人民，都有莫知適從之苦，阻礙了經濟之改善及其正常的發展。除了機構的重複，職權不統一之外，還有不合理不合情的許多「原則」與「法令」「條例」之類，其動機或者都是很好的，但是因爲沒有對症下藥，沒有經過細的，全面的，深入的硏究，忽促擬定，率爾實施，結果便與預期相反了。此外，有許多制度，從政治到經濟，都不適合中國國情，不適合各個區域特殊條件，更不適合不同地區之不同的民情。有些制度，在東京或者確是很好，而獲得優良效果，可是一到上海，也許會得到全不相同的結果。我們今後不言挽救中國經濟病症則已，否則，對於以上各點，必須首先細心研究一下。我們的話，也許因爲太懇切而率直些，但爲了中日經濟前途着想，我們不得不說。</p>
<p>中國經濟病症之挽救，中國經濟事業之好轉，應以上海爲開始，這是誰都不用懷疑的。而中日經濟之眞正的合作，更應由上海發動，爲中日有識人士共同的意見，我們更應指出，東亞共榮圈的達全與否，亦應以上海當地經齊可入正軌與否爲關鍵。但上海經濟之病象，又爲全國經濟病之典型，其與政治病態之密切關係，尤爲明顯。舉凡囤積·投機·生產减少·暴富與極貧之尖銳的對立等惡現象，無不當從政治與經濟兩方面同時並進謀求解救之法。當此上海租界實行交還，而友邦經濟使節蒞華玫察之際，上海經濟之復甦·中國經濟之發展，中日經濟更切實與全面之合作，東亞共榮圈經濟之最後完成，我們不禁竭誠額手以期待之！</p>
<p>我們昨今兩天所說的徧於病狀和病源，希望使節團諸君於處方前的參考。此外，中國人民與上海工商界積極的具體的意見，我們也將　情的傳達於團員諸君，以期得到對症的藥方。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>中日經濟提携的推進</h3>
<p>日華交歡民間經濟使節團，由小倉正恒氏任團長，來訪中國，對於前進中的中日新關係，具有莫大意義。</p>
<p>交還租界，撤廢治外法權，使中國成爲眞正獨立國，中國欲適應此新國除地位，則經濟之復興，爲不可缺的條件。而復興經濟、國外的助力，實不可缺。關於此點，則捨日本以外莫求。這次經濟考察團的來華，正適合了這個必然性。</p>
<p>國府的參戰，就表示中日同心合力，向完成戰爭與建設共榮圈邁進。中國要完成此重任的道路，多數還在於經濟方面，這是一致公認的。所以中日經濟提携更具有深切的意義。小倉團長說：「就現在的世界戰爭性格而論，大東亞戰爭不完全勝利，則大東亞共榮圈的建設勢不可能，大東亞共榮圈之建設不成，更何從求東亞民族的福利」此言實具有深意。</p>
<p>然則使而團之使命，具體的是什麼呢？第一，使節團應就中日兩國經濟的相互關係與華方經濟人坦白交換意見。第二，使節團應該把日本對於統制經濟的經騐，坦白公開。誠懇的指導中國經濟界。第三，使節團亦應努力促進國民政府與中國經濟界的意志疏通，換言之，即使節團應該充分理解雙方的意見，使兩者的見解一致，發展，而能有所貢獻於中國經濟的復興。（雲鸝：譯自七月八日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>新幾內亞島日軍　向登陸敵軍施反攻　日陸海空軍互相呼應　展開立體予敵重創</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日大本營八日下午卅分發表：新幾內亞島東南部薩拉摩亞（Salamaua）附近之日軍守備隊，自六月卅日以來，即對於那索灣（NassauBay）登陸之美軍及與此呼應自瓦屋（Wan）方面前進之澳洲軍，實施反擊作戰。七月五日在伯布比附近急襲敵軍之背後，使之潰亂。日航空部隊亦於一日三日及五日攻擊那索灣之敵軍，與敵舟艇羣及上陸地點等以極大損失東京八日中央社電據此問軍事專家談：美軍自大月卅日以來，爲圖以有力部隊，在太平洋水域實行反攻，乃在所羅門羣島·倫巴特島·新佐治亞島登陸實行反攻。刻正與日陸海兩軍部隊，在陸海空三方展開激烈之立體載中，如八日下午三時半日大本營所發表者。美軍在倫特巴島登陸之日，並在新幾內亞島東南部那索灣登陸，同時澳洲軍與美軍互相呼應，由瓦屋方面向前挺進，日駐薩拉摩亞方面守備隊，當即向敵軍實行反攻，尤其於五日曾在伯布他潛附近急襲敵軍背後使其潰亂，同時日航空部隊亦呼應陸上部隊，於一日三日五日三日間猛炸那索灣之美軍，炸沈美軍大批舟艇，重創其碼頭，並於十日戰中，擊落美機多架。又美軍之在倫特巴島新佐治亞島及那索灣之登陸，與澳洲軍在瓦屋方面之前進，顯爲在一聯作戰下實行者。此次敵軍之反攻，觀其戰意兵力裝備，均未可輕視，然日軍守備隊已與陸海空三軍打成一片，猛烈反擊，敵軍計自六月卅日以來，該方面日軍已擊落美機一百廿八架以上，擊沈其艦艇多艘，其兵員之損失，實已達一萬一千餘人。</p>

<p>統帥鮑斯訓勉將士</p>
<p>昭南八日中央社電　印度獨立聯盟會長兼印度國民軍總帥江特拉鮑斯，於八日印度國民軍發表創立時，向國民軍將士親致訓話，勗勉努力，茲誌其大意如下；國民軍將士諸君，今日應爲余生平最得意之一日，神已欣然囑余，向全世界發表印度國民軍之光榮創立，茲印度國民軍已於昔爲英帝國牙城之新加坡要塞古戰塲，即今日之新昭南，已完成組織。本軍不僅應爲掙脫英國桎梏，爭取解放，且應爲建設自由印度國軍之根幹，全印人士對於本軍之完全在印指導下組成人，且將在歷史的重大時機來臨時，踴躍出發前綫，實可引爲無上之光榮。一九四一年十二月，日軍開始進擊時，衝至新加坡，而我等於未來之戰鬥，則應高呼衝到德裏，屆時我軍中究有幾人能得生還尙不可知，但余今可斷言者，即最後之勝利必屬於吾人。迄今爲止，印度抗敵工作之最遺憾者，即在各方面雖已逐漸形成印度獨立之氣運，但第一條件尙付缺如，此即尙未有爲印度解放之軍隊。但今則得諸君之率先參加，而組成印度國民軍，此爲諸君之特權及名譽，而印度自由解放前途之最後障碍，亦已由諸君之手將其消除。故諸君對此爲達成紳聖目的之先驅者，實可引爲光榮，予願於此說明印度民衆，在今日戰爭中之兩大使命，其一爲印人應不惜任何犧牲，以武力爲爭取印度之自由、其二爲應組織足以永久確保印度自由獨立之常備軍隊。吾人今後應在國防上建築成堅强之堡壘，諸君尤應以誠實義務犧牲爲軍人之信條，且須躬行實踐。余有生以來自最可誇示者既如上述，且更信今日印人除參加民族解放戰爭而外，我人能得最高之榮譽，然余認爲獲得此種光榮，同時即有重大之責任。余誓於無論何時，與諸君同其命運，而余款向諸君請求者，惟積極進運與不惜犧牲而已，諸君苟能不願生死隨余前進，則余確信將導諸君於勝利與自由之途。吾等唯一願望，不僅在爭取一部份印人之自由，而欲求印度之完全獨立，故吾人爲印度獨立，亦惟有準備一切犧牲。</p>
<h3>英印軍司令　抵新德裏</h3>
<p>斯丹埠八日中央社電　據新德里電：新任英印軍司令官歐慶萊克，於六日抵新德里，旋即赴任，當會見記者團時曾稱，「印度現爲反軸心國空軍之根據地但印度之危機正僡益深刻化」云。</p>
<h3>日華南軍報道部長談　美機襲粵之殘暴</h3>
<p>廣州八日中央社電　日華南派遣軍八日上午十一時發表，美駐渝空軍戰鬥轟炸機軍聯合編隊廿架，十七日下午三時五分侵入廣州上空，盲炸東江地區，及黃埔附近，日軍航空部隊當即起飛迎擊，擊落敵機二架，（一架不確）所餘敵機，即向西北逃去，是役日方無損失。</p>
<p>廣州八日中央社電　日華南派遣軍報道部長於八日上午十時就美機濫炸廣州事發表談話，大意謂，五月八日美駐渝空軍濫炸廣州市內，曾　盡　暴之能事，此事現猶深印於民衆腦海中美國動輒高呼正義人道，但美機竟於白畫恣意濫炸市內繁華街市，炸傷市民一千餘人之多，此種殘暴行爲，實爲人神所共憤。中國民衆今不僅已知美駐渝空軍之企圖，在借援助之美名，以逞其制覇中國之野心，且已親身體騐。美駐渝空軍司令部，深恐本國及渝方知其無能爲力，曾於七月四日美駐渝空軍成立紀念日發表，　過去一年間美國駐渝空軍人員之損失僅爲九人，行踪不明者僅三人云云，此種事實完全不符。即使美國空軍人員陣亡於昆明及梓林等地上空者姑置不談，則僅廣州一地所已超過此數、蓋去年十月在珠江河畔被擊落之美機中被俘者計有阿拉斯中尉，路諾斯少尉，馬尤普隊長，揚格隊長等四人，去年十一月在廣州地區被擊落之美機中有唐爾中尉等二人被俘。又本年五月八日在廣州市內被擊落之美機中亦有普萊曼少尉等六人被俘。觀此事實駐渝美空軍之故意隱瞞損害，已至爲顯然。</p>
<h3>美空軍少校　被日擊落</h3>
<p>廣州八日中央社電　據渝息，駐渝美空軍司令部七日發表，駐渝美空軍戰鬥機隊中隊長羅巴德少校，於一日單獨駕機偵察洞庭湖北岸石首華容之際，被日軍地上砲火擊落</p>
<h3>珠江航行　解除宵禁</h3>
<p>廣州八日中央社電　珠江夜問航行，過去規定下午十時爲止，茲因治安業已恢復，並爲增强船舶運輸能力起見，廣州日海軍武官府已於八日發表，自本月十日起，許往來船舶，不論晨夜，可在珠江內自由航行。</p>
<h3>日經濟考察團　即將赴京</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　日中國經濟考察團團長小倉正恒氏等一行，定在滬稍作勾留後，即行來京，並將晋謁國府汪主席致敬，及訪晤國府各當局，就今後中日經濟合作問題，開誠懇談。</p>
<h3>日大本營發表　海南島日軍戰果</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日大本營八日正午發表：中國海南島方面之日海軍部隊，自本年二月廿一日以來，即對盤踞於該島西北部山岳地帶之敵軍加以攻擊，迄六月下旬止所獲戰果如左：（一）棄屍九千五百具，（二）投誠者三千六百人，（三）日軍鹵獲步槍千二百枝，彈藥十五萬二千發，機關槍手槍等二百九十挺，手溜彈一千八百六十六個，地雷三十個，捕獲船隻九十艘。</p>

<p>前年十二月八日大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府　據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明決與友邦日本同甘共苦，自是以來，着手新國民運動，從事保障治安，改善民生。期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭之完遂。乃英美等國仍沿用其百年以來分裂東亞之政策，且變本加厲，竟勾引渝方分子，參加所謂英美戰綫，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，最近因共暴力已次第爲友邦日本陸海空軍所擊破，侵略東亞之根據地亦已喪失，乃益逞狡謀。且嫉視國民政府統治區域之和平發展，嗾使渝方分子不斷侵擾，以阻撓各種建設之進行，並逕以自國飛機，藉渝方爲根據，向我武漢廣州等處屢施轟炸，殘害平民，在渝方分子，甘受英美驅使，躬爲東亞叛逆，固屬可恥：而英美對於東亞處心積慮，盡其挑撥離間之能事，以圖遂其最後併吞之欲，尤爲東亞民族所當同仇敵愾，國民政府爲此宣告，自今日起，對英美處於戰爭狀態，當悉其全力，與友邦日本協力，一掃英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放。滿泰兩國，夙敦友好，對於東亞共榮，尤貝同心，今後當益謀提携，以期共同建設以道義爲基礎之東亞新秩序。德義諸友邦，數年以來，在西方與英美勢力周旋，迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相與呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秩序有所實獻，凡我國民，當知此爲實現國父大亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之復興，大東亞共榮建設之實現，世界全體　義和平之獲得，胥繫於此，其一德一心，我力始終，以貫徹此偉大時代之偉大使命！</p>

<h3>畑總司令　發表赴魯觀感</h3>
<p>南京八日中央電　日中國派遣軍畑總司令官，前於六月二十一日曾赴營省視察日軍部隊，公畢以後，即於六月二十八日返抵此間，八日並招待記者團發表視察觀感，其意謂日本對中國新方針之精神，已着着推至日軍各方面，並使其具體實行，此種事業已在中國方面反映，即最近中國方面對日本眞意已漸瞭解而相互協力。今日中國軍警對於地方治安之努力維持極爲認眞，各省政府及縣政府均深知施政責任重大，故無不努力以赴，而與日方之聯絡亦更趨緊密，最近渝軍來歸擁護國府者已見激增。本年魯省各地農作經過良好，定卜豐年，且各地治安極爲鞏固，此實深堪欣慰，余於此次視察途次，曾順道至曲阜瞻謁孔廟，得悉該地在過去千餘年中雖屢遭兵燹而不毀，尤令人深惑儒敎潛勢力之偉大。</p>
<h3>吳化文飛京</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　山東方面軍自經中央特派軍事參議院院長蕭叔宣上將前往點騐，業經點騐完竣，該軍總司令吳化文將軍於七日下午乘機飛京。茲悉吳將軍來京任務係向最高軍事當局請示戎機，並商討該軍整編步驟。</p>

<p>南京八日中央社電　，財部銳務署長邵式軍氏上月奉命赴滿考察稅務，茲已公畢，於昨日八日下干二時五十分自北平率隨員一行，搭機返京。</p>
<h3>蔡大使觀宴　日外交要員</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　中國駐日大使蔡培氏，於七日正午歡宴日外務省高級人員。到重光外相，松木次官，暨各局長等，席間並互相懇談至爲歡洽。又蔡大使於八日下午三時應母校早稻田大學之請，前往演講，以中日邦交之增進爲題，詳述中日邦交之現况與將來，並指出中日兩國之眞誠合作，必能完成大東亞共榮圈之建設，歷時四十分鐘始畢，聽講教授及學生數十人，無不深爲動容。</p>
<h3>渝方中共　發生糾紛</h3>
<p>里斯水八日中央社電　據路透社重慶來電，渝「宣傳部長」張道藩於七日會見記者團時曾發表謂，中共駐渝代表周恩來，此次因第三國際解散、中共內部發生糾紛，故已離此赴延安云。觀此項說明，可知中共內部因一部黨員主張改　國家中心政策，而另一部則仍堅持繼續國際運動，故分成兩派，途致發生對立。</p>

<p>里斯本八日中央社電　據華盛頓消息，北非法分裂滬領袖季勞，昨日下半乘飛機抵美華盛噸，羅斯福總統偕其全體僚屬立即加以延見。季勞及其隨員三人所乘之機，在波林塲陸軍根據地降落時，美方會　禮砲十七　，歡迎委員會係由總統之私人參謀長李希海軍上將領　，季勞之　員爲其密友鮑弗爾少校。波尼斯基少校及維萊海軍中尉。</p>
<h3>軸心外交人員　撤離智利</h3>
<p>倍　斯愛勒八日中央社電　據智利外交部昨日宣佈：第一批軸心外交人員暨以前僑居智利之義人六十五名，業已離智京赴阿根廷京城。</p>
<h3>美總統召回　駐瑞典代表</h3>
<p>赫爾辛基八日中央社電　據德國新聞社訊：駐瑞典美大使館參事霍柏教授最近被召囘國，業已啓程返美。霍氏駐瑞京任美國戰時情報局之代表，並主持駐瑞使館之宣傳事務，渠被認爲係羅斯福總統之特派全權代表，負有代蘇聯及波羅的海國家任「觀察員」之特殊使命。渠任職僅一年即被召囘，其原因爲渠對於東方政策之問題發言不愼云。</p>
<h3>庫斯克前綫　展開坦克大戰　德稱已突破蘇主要防綫</h3>
<p>瑞典京城八日中央社電　東綫開戰以來最大之坦克車戰爭，已於今日發生。柏林方面宜佈：昨日德軍擊毀蘇軍坦克車逾四百輛及飛機一九三架，莫斯科報吿謂貝爾哥洛特及奥勒爾南部區域之戰事，其激烈情形爲前所未有，巨量坦克車之衝擊及不休止之空戰，仍在繼續增强中。柏林方面謂，雙方在庫斯克區之空戰，均已全力相持，所用之飛機數量，亦爲前所未見，蘇軍且以從未用過之巨大數量之坦克車加入戰事。據云蘇方所投失之四百輛坦克車，係被德陸軍高射砲隊及俯衡轟炸機與戰鬥機所擊毀者。蘚軍於三日戰事內，損失飛機達八百三十架，而柏林方面稱，　機所損失者僅五十四架。柏林方面復稱，蘇方之堅强防禦制度，已於昨日激戰後被德軍突破，德俯衝轟炸機及戰鬥機，隨時隨地均給與地上作戰部隊莫大之協助，德軍於忍受蘇軍之攻勢，歷二日後，即轉取反攻，於慘烈之戰爭下，曾突破蘇主要戰綫數處。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社軍事特派員稱：庫斯克（Kurski）戰事之第三日，因德軍深入蘇軍堅强梯形防守陣地之結果，奧勒爾（Orle）以北與貝爾哥洛特（ByGlfiorod）以南之前綫業已大形縮短。此四十萬蘇軍精銳所在之半圓形，雖尙有極强大之坦克車與砲兵隊爲輔，但在戰略上實爲敵方處境最爲危險之陣地，目前德軍已突破奥勒爾與米森斯克間之義軍陣綫，同時另一德軍部隊亦攻入貝爾哥洛特更南之蘇軍防綫。蘇軍陣地現有愈趨不利之現象，故蘇軍刻企圖進攻該半圓形西部之德陣綫，以避免德軍之兩翼包抄行動。星期三戰事重心仍在南北兩翼，蘇軍之進攻已在多處被德軍擊退。蘇軍集合如許大批精銳於東斯克灣，可見其有意在該處發動大規模攻勢，以改進其軍略地位，現庫斯克之蘇方機塲均羣集飛機，故可以斷言蘇軍攻勢之最後目的，係在奪囘基輔與聶普羅披特羅夫斯克兩地。</p>
<p>目前庫斯克戰事尙未達到頂點，似無可疑。蘇軍此次攻勢實毫無成就。事實上德軍在東綫方面由原來之守勢地位而改爲攻勢，今已爲第三次，第一次係在一九四二年五月，因丁莫森柯元帥在卡柯夫之攻勢而引起德軍之反攻，第二次仍在卡柯夫區，時在水年三月，孟斯坦上將統率精兵在唐納資盆地與波爾達伐發動反攻，卒將卡柯夫奪囘。</p>
<p>此次德軍在庫斯克發動攻勢之前。早已偵悉蘇軍之企圖，故在奧勒爾與貝爾哥洛特已集有充足之兵力。該處德軍配備精良，敵方亦以新式坦克車出動作戰，雙方皆使用新式兵器，故此次庫斯克之戰局發展，當可試騐新兵器之效用矣。同時雙方均使用堅强之砲兵及大隊空軍作戰，亦爲此次戰事之特徵。目前庫斯克區空戰之激烈，實爲東綫前所未見，德軍所出動之飛機，更多於英美在突尼西亞所使用之飛機，故德空軍在庫斯克極佔優勢，制空權已於昨日落入德軍手中云。</p>
<h3>物資調查委員會　分區調查囤積</h3>
<p>中央社八日南京電　物資調査委員會自經最高國防會議這過組織條例及委員人選後，該會既已在滬辦公，計調査官十五名，由滬市府日本總領署，日憲兵隊，及公共租界工部局與法租界公董局，分別選派，由滬市市長兼任委員長，調査重要囤積物資，並先後舉行會議，商討具體之調査方案及調查結果之法律處置問題。聞其調査原則，（一）中日調靑官分別調査其該國人士，故工作進行頗爲相宜，（二）市區公共租界區，法租界區分別調査，以收事中功倍之效。如査出國積重要物資等情，當依囤積治罪條例議處。</p>
<p>德國名將指揮作戰雙方兵力百萬以上</p>
<p>斯德哥爾摩八日中央社電　據德元首大本營七日正午發表：庫斯克突出部分之攻防戰，激戰三目來，其特點現已判明，（一）冬季戰後，德蘇兩軍即集結大軍於該地，據推算德蘇兩軍於該地集結之兵力均在百萬以上，戰車千輛左右，又據路透社莫斯科電稱：德軍之裝甲兵力及空軍力，均較蘇軍佔有絕對優勢，此證七日一日間蘇聯損失戰車百九十大輛之多，即可知此乃確係事實。（一）以言戰綫之制空權，此以七日一日間蘇軍喪失飛機百四十架，德軍僅損失八架之事實而觀。則該綫之制空權，實已完全入於德軍手中。又據德軍當局之測定，德空軍與蘇空軍之比率乃爲十四對一，又此次作戰雙方均已使用重輕咆火已達最高數。德軍當局且謂「砲擊戰規模之大與熾烈，實屬空前」。（一）據路透社莫斯科電，直接指揮庫斯克突出部分作戰之德軍首腦爲克魯格元帥，克氏於一九四〇年之法蘭德爾戰役，曾樹立殊勳，一九四一出現於東部戰綫，於比雅利斯多克·明斯克·斯摩倫斯克等戰役，曾發揮其超特之機動戰術，故克魯格元帥實德軍之第一流名將</p>
<h3>軸心國在地中海　仍保持天空優勢　比塞港猛烈空襲</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　據海通社訊：德軍界人士認爲最近數日地中海方面，尤其是西西里與撒丁島之激烈空戰，已足證明軸心國空軍仍在該處佔有優勢，英美亦承認屢圖殲毀該處義飛行塲之行動，而所得結果適相反。軸心國之防務則愈戰愈强，計英美於本月三日在上述兩地視失飛機五十二架，四日五十六架，六日五十一架，多數均爲四引擎之轟炸機，軸心國在此三日內則僅損失十六架。英國現亦承認軸心國防務極强，協約機三十架企圖轟炸西西里之甘比尼時，曾遭軸心國戰鬥機百餘架之攔截，至敵方所稱軸心國空軍所受之損失，則目擊者類能證明其失實純係出睹揑造云。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德國新聞社特約訪員論地申海區之戰事稱：據德方偵察飛機員於星期三日所得之觀察，德轟炸機强大部隊於六月六日晚猛襲比塞大港，引起敵方重大之損害，德機一部份向整個港口低飛襲擊，使英美艦隊最電要之砲合之一，遭受嚴重之打擊，此外停泊於港內或堤道外之敵船數艘，亦遭重型炸彈直接擊中，受創甚重，其中大多數可認爲已告損失。同時英美空軍昨日繼續空襲西西里島，敵機十七架爲德義戰鬥機與高射砲隊所擊落，該記者宋稱，英美在過去四日內空襲義大利城市、損失飛機不下一百七十六架，其中大多數爲四引擎之轟炸機。</p>
<p>反軸心軍集中作攻歐之準備</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德國新聞社特別訪員稱，據可靠消息稱，英美艦隊包括英皇喬治號式者數艘，已　直布羅陀港西駛，此舉究與進攻歐陸有何關係，尙屬未詳。所知者，數星期來反軸心國在地中海之艦隊，確已大增其實力，其中包括有美國戰艦及航空母艦數艘，運兵至北非及遠東之輪舶及供應船亦大見增加，惟現代戰爭之趨勢，已指出僅願空軍力量，不足奏攻佔之功，故文森霍華將軍自八星期來，即盡力補充兵力及軍火，反軸心軍在地中海之實力，自北非起至叙利亞止，已集結四十四師團之步兵及坦克車編隊十五至二十隊之多，內包括有英美傘兵部隊及空中登陸部隊二師團，其使命顯爲造成橋頭堡壘，此項兵力尙包括有小組坦克車隊乃附屬於摩托化步兵隊者。巴氏謂，以上所列數字，乍視之似覺極可畏懼，惟經詳細硏究後，即知此項軍力之一半，必須留駐于原來駐紮地點，尤要者爲阿爾及里亞·叙利亞·巴勒斯坦·埃及·及義屬北非諸地，蓋反軸心團必須以雄軍駐留，方可維持其統治力量也。更有甚者，乃反軸心軍之一部包括有希臘軍·捷克軍·塞爾維亞軍及敘利亞軍，渠等戰鬥力即英美方面亦認爲不高，且此種混雜烏合軍隊，本身之戰鬥力亦屬疑問。另一方面則爲在北非之戰具之運輸及轉渡，必須由反軸心軍自行處理，因該處之土著工人不敷故也。且北非之道路及鐵道亦必須用軍隊建造之，而艾森霍華將軍尙須特別訓練戰鬥力並不强之美軍，此項美軍之戰鬥力，於突尼西亞戰事中已可證明。由此觀之，在地中海區之反軸心軍欲攻雨歐時，僅有一部份之兵力可用，而此可用之兵力必須爲反軸心軍隊中之最優秀份子，目前軸由軍之防禦工事，益使反軸心軍之侵歐暫試，，冒有更大之危險性。反軸心軍欲與東綫戰事同時發動侵歐，乃係危舉，因在地中海之德空軍之威力，仍足予以侵犯者極大之打擊也。</p>
<h3>德國郵船　成爲少女營</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　前服務於南美航綫之德華麗航輪「卡潑阿爾柯那」號，現已成爲海軍輔助隊之四百名德國少女之家庭。渠等不僅在船上臥　且以大部份時間，消磨於船中，尤喜該船所備之廣大甲板運動塲。</p>
<h3>華北最近的動態</h3>
<p>自日本實施對華新政策後，跟着有租界的交還，敵產的移交國府管理，地方行政機關中日藉指導員的撤退等政治的處置，並加緊把占領地經營的事業移交中國。在華北方面在着着進行中者，有限制物資移動的緩和及撤廢，廢止特務機關，大最撤退新民會中的日籍指導員，並把民生機關的主體及製共委員會等移交中國方面管轄。這證明了日本的新政策不分華中華北，以中國全體爲對象。以前華北的諸施策，在「華北的特殊性」之下而建設起來的華北一帶的既成事實，完全凝集於協力遂行大東亞戰爭的兵站基地這一點，這與新政策的運營應在那一點上加以調整呢？以下來看從當地所見聞的種種近况：</p>
<p>（一）物價，食糧，燃料問題　華北政務委員會前曾在物價，物資調整委員會之下設置食糧監理局，在各省各特別市設食糧聯運社，以期確立收買機構而維持糧食。更於五日爲防止囤積而頒布有關食糧物價的條例，自二十日起實施公定價格制。</p>
<p>這幾種施策都已奏效，食糧物價自六日以來即告囘跌，現在已經比本年三月的物價還要低。又本年收成，據五月末的調査，較往年的增加二成。這是食糧問題可吿解決的一點。</p>
<p>（二）對中共問題　如前次日軍大城戶部隊長的談話中所示，日本方面指導的剿共委員會已告解散，在華北政務委員會下新設剿共委員會，與政務委員會，新民會等協力磋商剿共對策。</p>
<p>各縣現已設有剿共委員會的支部，對中共的政治攻勢開始猛烈的鬥爭。山西省省長司直答覆記者關於中共的質問如次：</p>
<p>「中共現在依然繼續三分軍事，七分政治的工作。中共的政治，因其宣傳之故，對民衆眞有相當的魅力，這是不容爭的事實，但中共方面之有貪官汚吏的存在。確屬無可諱飾，他們獎勵民衆栽培鴉片，這是毒害民衆的東西。我們在二月曾嚴禁栽培鴉片，對於中共的貪官劣跡，我們則保守廉潔政治。他們用鴉片來毒化民衆，我們則嚴加禁止。六月中普乘飛機視察全省，全然不見有栽培鴉片的農地。這是本省政治力的滲透之晴雨計。」</p>
<p>一面山西省並編成民衆自衛組織性質的靑年隊，建築起防共的堡壘，蒐集情報，頗有相當成績。</p>
<p>（三）勞働問題　關於晋四。晋北一帶的煤·鐵·石·等重要資源的開發之勞働問題，華北向來是世界有名的勞働力供給市塲，所以並無因難。</p>
<p>例如大同煤礦，中日工我共同在幾百尺之深的礦道中開始增加產煤運動，業已突破預定量，可惜運輸力尙不能相應。</p>
<p>（四）治安　原第二十四集國軍軍長龐炳勳，孫殿英兩將軍，毅然參加和平運動，擊潰以太行山脈爲根據的渝車，翼東，晋北，晋西各地的中共軍亦告覆滅，治安日見進步，</p>
<p>因而華北的治安强化運動的任務暫告完成，七月起，展聞了華北新建設運動、該運動把日方的對華新政策貫澈於中國方而，同時，爲了完遂大東亞戰爭，如何建設華北，如何使之成爲兵姑基地，當爲今後重點的所在。</p>
<p>（五）新國民運動　國民政府自日本開始對華新政策以來，即全面的展開新國民運動，以爲向建設統一國家而邁進的一部，從這見地看來亟應打破華北的特殊性以謀强化中央政治力。</p>
<p>自去秋汪主席訪問北京以來，如主席之就任新民會名譽會長。新民會採納新國民運動，靑天白日旗在華北的採用，華北政務委員會委員長之參輿國府最高國防會議，修正政務委員會的組織條例等許多政治的措置，無不不爲華北中央化的措置，華北方面對此亦爲「無華北即無中央、無中央即無華北」的熱情以酬應，向完遂戰爭邁進。</p>
<p>華北原具有防共第一綫及中日滿經濟中核體的二面性、包括這具有特殊性的華北之中國歷日本新協力關係的骨幹，應爲以兩國的能率主義爲中心的平等分担主義。無論如何，華北對國府固然不應該强調特殊性，亦不應對日本立於特殊的立塲，參戰中國應發展其大東亞共榮圈的特殊性，換言之，即完遂大東亞戰爭之兵站基地的有力地位，與南方諸民族共同努力以戰勝這一次大戰，這是華北，國府，日本所應共間牢記不忘的。（翔：譯自六月二十六日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>唐理事長致歡迎詞</h3>
<p>商統會唐理事長致歡迎詞云：今日全國商業統制總會全體理監事竭誠歡迎日本經濟考察團小倉團長閣下及諸位先生，承蒙撥冗光臨，非常榮幸，小倉團長閣下及諸位先生，都是日本國內金融界經濟界有力權威，同時分別担當國內各項重要任務，此次暫時放下本身工作，不遠千里而來，足見對於中日經濟提攜，和中國各項經濟問題，都　重視。我們很顧藉此機會，表示一點我們對於經濟問題的意見。中日經濟提攜，已爲兩國政府旣定方針，列入國策，但是如何方能實現。全仗兩國金融界經濟界互相認識，互相了解，通力合作，中國一向是個生產落後的國家，無論工業方面或農業方面，都顯呈一種成產不足的現象，平時如此，戰時爲尤甚，所以增加生產實爲中國目前第一要務。但是如果所有的條件不具備，所用的方法不適當，不但不能得到增產的效騐，還恐不免得到相反的結果，中日經濟提攜的最要條件，是中國先有一個鞏固的經濟基礎，而鞏固的經濟基礎，則奠立於生產方面，所以很希望友邦金融經濟界先進，儘可能的幫助中國解決增加生產的先決條件，並研究增加生產的所用的各種方法，最重要者，尤其是如何方能引起生產者對於增加生產之興趣，在戰爭時期，人民應該節衣縮食，固屬天經地義，可是人民生活民最低限度，必要設法維持，否則不但不能增加生產，甚至減低生產，因之對於分配方面，大之如兩國間物資分配，小之如國內人民日用品之分配，皆應爲迅速合理之調整，這是一個現實的問題，也就是中日經濟提攜的基礎條件。</p>
<p>物資統制，名義上自三月十五全國商業統制總會成立之日起實行，但是事實上固爲下層機構有待逐層一一組織，直至現在，猶未組織完善，故工作推動尙有所待，物資統制在中國是一個創舉，担任統制工作的各同人，對於統制的學識經騐，又素感缺乏，所以對於統制工作的前途，還不敢十分置信，貴國對於物資統制在事變前即已局部實行，近年來逐步改善，愈見完備周密，此次貴國中並有辦理貿易統制專家參加，如蒙不吝賜敎，多多指示，俾獲牽作南針，尤所欣幸</p>
<h3>日使節團長致辭</h3>
<p>今晚承全國商業統制總會舉行盛大的歡迎會，衷心非常感謝，幣人謹代表全體同人表示謝意。</p>
<p>囘想我們中日兩國國民，旣是東亞的隣人，又是同文　　的民族，自古以來，就有　　相依的關係，不幸自西歐人侵入東亞後，兩國之間，受他們的挑撥反間，不知不覺發生種種複雜的關係，致引起了不幸的事件發生，這實在是不勝遺憾的事，幸而汪主席閣下調察大　，毅然離開渝方，　都南京，並決意與日本協力，拯救中國於危亡，向建設大東亞共榮國之途邁進。今年一月，再進一步，對英美宣戰，表示與我日本同生共死之決心，中日兩國於是同立於一條戰綫上，一致協力共禦外敵，這眞是從未有過的事情，現在在歐洲方面，則是軸心國的互相死鬥，此可謂爲建設世界新秩序有史以來未有的大轉換期了。我們處此環境中，是應盡我們所有的智能，以期得到必勝。我們知道，要建設世界新秩序，首應建設東亞龔榮國，換句話說，東亞龔榮國未建設以前，世界新秩序就不能再建於後，然而東亞共榮國的建設，必要中日兩國全面的協力爲中樞，其中特別重要的，則爲經濟協力，這也是各位已經調察的，所以我們兩國經濟協力上所負的歷史的使命，是至重且大的。敵人敢信中日兩國經濟協力之逾，黨　　　經濟人士之誠心誠意的提攜，中日經濟人士如能互相信任堅强團結，無論前途難局重重，亦可迎刃而解。果如此言，則東亞經濟共榮團建設必成，大東亞各民族亦可永享和平安居榮　得幸福，同時燦爛的世界新秩序，業可在這時完成，再進一步說，兩國經濟人士應如何方能誠心的信任呢？那當然是從用　　得態度，互相諒解對方的立塲，尊重人格，屈膝暢談做起，此次我們一行到貴國來訪的目的，不外乎以上所說的各點，我們在這裏能夠親與貴國經濟界權威人士相聚一堂，並對貴國因收囘租界等關係脫離百年來英美桎梏，對於明朗的中國，謹表無限慶賀。且得拜玲種種坦白高見，希望增強中日提攜的基礎，所以幣人等在滬，儘時日所許，很希望和各方面交換意見，今晚承聚盛大招宴，非常感謝，現在借主人的美酒，恭祝全國商業統制總會之發展</p>

<p>渝方及中共對於交還租界，有何態度表明，尙不得而知。但據確息稱：中共對此之意見如次：</p>
<p>我們對於日本的軍事力景，政治力量及南京政府的政治力量，向來能作正確估計，對於日本交還租界亦能作正確估計者，恐怕祗有我們吧。有人以爲交還租界就是日本從中國敗退的初步，蓋日本必須進軍澳洲，蘇聯，印度方面，所以交還租界即可認爲日本從中國敗退的象徵，我們對於這種見解，　端反對，吾人深知今後日本在中國戰綫上仍能繼續若干亡勢，在政治上，經濟上强化南京政府的方策，將更進一步，而南京政府的政治力，亦不容忽視，上海的中國國民，對於國際的政治情勢，較對國內更爲關心，認爲日本立刻就要敗退，或則，在此國際情勢下，南京政府對於國民，沒有什麽力量。總之，他們因國際情勢而一喜一憂，昨日冷眼　觀，今日起來協力，明日又復離反，採取一種政治投機的態度，但是此種政治投機的態度，在我們的工作上是絕對不予以採取的。須知今後的抗戰，說不定會拖上二十年，三十年，應該正確估計敵方的力量，斷不可因國際政局的幻變而一喜一憂，須憑自己的力量來建設牢不可破的抗戰根據地，這就是我們對於日本及南京政府的基本態度。</p>
<p>上面這一段是中共的態度，而爲其所指摘的，就是政治投機與經濟投機，這是絕對應該注意的，關於經濟機濟，數月來已爲中日兩國國身所經歷的了，但是租界交還以後，假使政治投機再不絕跡，則其影響上海經濟殊非淺鮮，國府爲上海政治經濟之健全化，今後將取何種對策，極堪注目，汪主席在出席蘇州清鄉工作紀念大會時，曾於途次發表肅清上海投機思想的決意。要肅清投機思想，必須確立廉潔政治，肅清貪官污吏，才能收到偉大成果。（雲鵬：續譯大陸新報）</p>

<h3>好學近乎知</h3>
<p>— 梭羅金</p>
<p>知者天才也，天才是由於環境之誘發，而表現出之先天性才富，但是非常的可惜，世界上往往有很多的人，由於環境之不良。因此不能將自己的天賦才能表現出來、以至於終身不得志。</p>
<p>人類——是世界之主宰，所以我們決不可以把自己一生之命運，支配於環境手中，我們應該奮鬥。使自己在不良之環境中，開闢出一條新路程。</p>
<p>羅曼羅蘭曾說：「天才是免不了有障礙，因爲障礙是創造天才的。」好學就是消滅障礙的唯一途徑，並且也是成就事業的最大原因。</p>
<p>俗語說：「我們的成績。就是我們血汗的結果。」我們自己不管是否缺乏先天性的才富，總之應該隨時隨刻的利用自己未開發的後天性的財源——好學，因爲愛迪生曾說：「天才是一分靈感和九十九分的血汗，」換句話說，天才是由努力所造成的，所以我們只要努力，也就是天才。</p>
<h3>國樂藝術在我國</h3>
<p>— 潘仰堯</p>
<p>音樂足以陶情，並能移風易俗，爲用至廣，厥效至宏，慨自歐風東漸以還，承學之士，多醉心於西樂，而於關係國粹乏國樂，特多漠視幾至廣陸散矣，禮失而求諸野，是可憂也。國樂專家衛仲樂教授爲我國國樂界之權威。衛先生自幼具藝術天才。弱冠時即從國樂前輩鄭　文先生硏習古樂十餘年，其心得既富，造詣更深。而於琵琶古琴等尤臻玉潤珠圓爐火純靑之至境。歷任上海美術專門學校，滬江大學音樂敎授，大同樂會音樂主任等職，造就人才，斐聲各界，曾周歷南京，湘，鄂及香港各地，舉行個人演奏會。每至一地，備受各界歡迎，輙載盛譽以歸。滬戰發生後，難胞邇地，衣食堪虞，衛君乃組音樂隊赴美演奏，以收入所得悉充救濟難民之用，在美遍歷各大都市，舉行音樂會凡百餘次，聽衆然烈歡迎，紐約泰晤士報評論衛君之演技竟與世界名提琴家克拉司雷相比擬，美國各著名廣播電台爭相羅致，衛君均以國樂播送，以國樂而博得歐美人士之稱　者，當以衛君爲嚆矢矣，茲者華北災祲，餓殍載道，中華基督敎靑年會少年部聯靑團契暨震旦高級中學同學會　君惻然憂之，舉辦音樂大會以所得悉充華北災民賑款，熱忱可敬，震旦暨聯　醫諸君商諸衛君請其聯辦演奏國樂以償滬上中外人士愛好衛君藝術之願，此舉不但於華北災民得益至巨，且有提倡及普遍國樂之重大意義。</p>
<h3>評逃婚</h3>
<p>— 陸光</p>
<p>「逃婚」是言慧珠的處女作，以一個京劇演員改演電影，多少在演技上留着一點京劇的素質，過去銀幕上有王熙春的說話完全「京劇化」就是一個顯明的佐證。言慧珠當然不能例外，在「逃婚」中處處流露京劇化，因此那過度的演技，給於觀衆新異的感覺。</p>
<p>「逃婚」是說一個有勇敢的女子，爲婚姻奮鬥，經過許多曲析的悲歡離合，達到有情人終成眷屬的結果，故事有現實性，在這新舊思想擊衝的大時代中，這樣的故事、時常發現在我們的四週。</p>
<p>因爲故事曲折。所以如果鄭小秋以純粹喜劇的導演手法處理，相信一定有更大的成功，現在祗在極經濟的剪接下，把故事交代明白，外景攝於揚州瘦四湖，大自然的景色，美麗的畫面，活躍在眼裏，好像參觀了繪畫展覽會　。</p>
<p>演員以言慧珠最佳，一舉一動，模仿陳雲裳活潑天眞，不過說話的聲浪，帶有京腔，聲調的高低，似乎並沒有表現出情感的流露，舒適莊嚴詼諧兼而有之，是最近最作的演出，歐陽莎菲也是很有希望的演員，表情自然，前途未可限量，賈子秋尙待努力，樂煒老練之匱。</p>
<p>總之，言慧珠的客串主演，一般的說法，還沒有給觀衆們失望，如果她能再拍一兩部片子，也許演技會得到更深的造就。</p>
<h3>抵家</h3>
<p>— 楊樹綱</p>
<p>抵家餘十里，山水步步親，旅　猶在箱，　衣俄覺新。原　未改昔，君落多因陳，迎問諸父老，迷眼少年人，隔　動歡呼，會面展懇懃，東家傳耗去，四　駐我輪，大嫂言辦飯，阿母釋我中，衆　四面會，庭堂一時紛。這行愧落泊。未定慰親姻。但道身無恙客子多酸辛。</p>
<h3>雞</h3>
<p>— 沈沈</p>
<p>接着三個人面面相覷了半晌，還是李鎭長先開。說：</p>
<p>「那未究竟怎樣了結呢？老實告訴你吧！他—指着屋角裏的阿坤，是一個頂窮頂窮的人，你們在他身上發洩，根本就弄錯了，我們替他跑了一黃昏，還是拿他的一張僅有的田單，向人家抵押到一筆錢，數目當然不多。可是，在我們看來，已經很爲吃力。剛才聽司令的口氣，似乎要重重的拷一記，那是無論如何辦不成的。就是打死他，也只好算命中註定了。」李鎭長一口氣說完，用冒着火的眼光，向張參謀緊瞧着。</p>
<p>「這種事情，都是這個小火夫弄出來的亂子。因爲司令要吃難，廚房沒有現成的，就派這小子去鄕下想法，不曉得　的他去了半天，跑囘來哭喪着說，雞是有的，人家不肯放手，反而給駡了一頓，還被打兩個嘴巴。加油加醬的說了一大套，廚子跑到司令面前，又是加油加醬的說一套。激得司令發怒起來、馬上派幾名弟兄，帶了小火夫把這個人拉來。我雖然明明曉得在搗鬼，可是，又有什麼辦法去阻止他們？現在事情既然弄假成眞了。其勢就不能不將計就計，李鎭長！你也不要動氣，現在究竟想法到多少錢，我看還是了結的好。」張參謀好像不耐煩。也很不平的樣子，說到本題了。</p>
<p>「多少錢嗎？只有六百元錢。還是我們兩個人趕到河東黃老伯家裏說情來的。」李鎭長已經是老於世故，時得隊部裏人，總是越多越好，所以少說二百元，留作退一步的需索。張參謀聽了，露了苦笑的臉色說這：</p>
<p>「那倒是尷尬的！這個數目，從來朱會有過。司令一定不會滿足的。就是我去說，恐怕也要挨他的駡，怎麼辦呢！」說罷低着頭，一面斜着眼望望綁在屋角裏的阿坤。</p>
<p>這時候阿坤雖然聽不淸楚他們三個人在講的什麼？可是隱隱的曉得了一些，料必是關於他自已怎樣發落的事了。他也疲乏得很，懶得抬起頭去着急了。他雖只是一個鄕下人，不曾經過世間複雜的事，可是在他腦海裏，想着爲了白吃雞不到，難道就可以吃我人了嗎？然而，事實是已經被牽被綁，好像待宰的羔羊，不能動彈了。（七）</p>

        <h1>1943.07.09</h1>
<h3>Advice to the Economic Delegation from Friendly Japan</h3>
<p>The economic delegation from friendly Japan arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is about to exchange opinions with various parties. Our government and people are expressing sincere welcome and great expectations. Because China and Japan have always been brotherly nations, and in the recent Great East Asia Liberation War, they have had a close relationship of sharing weal and woe. Good or bad in any aspect of politics and economy is enough to affect the other. Therefore, when the economic delegation from the friendly nation comes to China, they naturally cannot only work on superficial, partial, or written words and speeches, but must truly and practically observe all kinds of realities. At the same time, our government and people, in particular, should not harbor a psychological fear of admitting their faults and avoiding treatment. They must tell the truth and show the true situation to the friendly nation's delegation, so that it will not fail their ardent intention of traveling a long distance. It is precisely for this reason that we yesterday selected the main points of our country's current economic maladies and listed them one by one, speaking truthfully to express our loyalty, in order to achieve genuine cooperation between China and Japan in the economy. Our sincerity will surely be understood by everyone. Today, we earnestly point out that our country's economic illness is already very deep. If the governments and people of both countries do not devise remedies as soon as possible, the future crisis will be severe, with serious consequences for China, for the friendly nation, and for the entire Great East Asia Liberation cause.</p>
<p>However, if we only know the sick and the illness, without investigating the source of the illness, then the remedial work will inevitably be empty or achieve less than half the effort. As for where the root of the economic illness lies in the peace zone of our country, to be honest, it is inseparable from politics. Political illness is the cause, and economic illness is the result. Therefore, to cure the economic illness, we must first—at least simultaneously—cure the political illness; otherwise, it will ultimately be futile. The biggest root cause of China's economic illness today is that Chinese politics is not on the right track, and politics is not sound. Some leaders are failing in public expectations. In terms of political programs and policies, in recent decades, they have followed foreign policies without adapting them to the actual conditions of the country and the practical needs of the people. Therefore, they drift with the tide, and orders change frequently. At the same time, those in politics also rotate like revolving lanterns, coming and going, responding perfunctorily, without seriously and practically having a way to do things. And in reality, it is also impossible, resulting in the formation of unsound politics in China, affecting the economic illness. And the foreign forces that dominate behind the scenes only obtain a certain degree and form of semi-colonial "rights and interests" in China on the surface. These rights and interests are mostly one-sided, partial, and temporary, and they have nothing to do with the long-term interests of the international future. When another international force rises, there is a danger of being forced to retreat completely. Today's Britain and the United States can serve as a clear example. The bitter fruit of their failure to help improve Chinese politics, win people's hearts, and establish the foundation of state relations is precisely today's lesson for us.</p>
<p>Besides the above, what affects China's economy the most and makes it morbid is the lack of unity in the functions and powers of political institutions. There is no need to cite many historical examples. In terms of facts that have just passed, the functions and powers of political organs and control institutions related to the economy are also not unified or clear. It is commonplace for the Japanese side and the Chinese authorities to form overlaps, as well as overlaps within the Chinese institutions themselves. As a result, the economic circles and the general public suffer from not knowing what to do, hindering the improvement of the economy and its normal development. In addition to the duplication of institutions and the lack of unified powers, there are also many unreasonable and inhumane "principles" and "laws," "regulations," and the like. The motives may all be good, but because they are not prescribing the right medicine and have not undergone detailed, comprehensive, and in-depth research, they are drafted hastily and implemented rashly, and the result is the opposite of what was expected. In addition, there are many systems, from politics to economics, that are not suitable for China's national conditions, not suitable for the special conditions of various regions, and even less suitable for the different customs of different regions. Some systems may indeed be very good in Tokyo and achieve excellent results, but when they come to Shanghai, they may get completely different results. If we don't talk about saving China's economic ailments from now on, otherwise, we must first carefully study the above points. Our words may be too earnest and straightforward, but for the sake of the economic future of China and Japan, we have to say them.</p>
<p>The salvation of China's economic ailments and the improvement of China's economic undertakings should begin with Shanghai. No one needs to doubt this. And the genuine cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese economies should be initiated by Shanghai, which is the common opinion of knowledgeable people from China and Japan. We should also point out that whether the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can be fully realized depends on whether the local economy of Shanghai can be brought back on track. However, the economic illness of Shanghai is a typical example of the economic illness of the whole country, and its close relationship with political morbidity is particularly obvious. All the evil phenomena, such as hoarding, speculation, reduced production, sharp opposition between sudden wealth and extreme poverty, must be solved simultaneously from both political and economic aspects. As the Shanghai concessions are being returned and the economic delegation from the friendly nation is visiting China to investigate, we cannot help but sincerely look forward to the recovery of Shanghai's economy, the development of China's economy, the more practical and comprehensive cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese economies, and the final completion of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere economy!</p>
<p>What we have said in the past two days is about the symptoms and sources of the disease, in the hope that the members of the delegation will refer to it before prescribing a prescription. In addition, we will also convey the active and concrete opinions of the Chinese people and the Shanghai business community to the members of the delegation, in order to obtain the right medicine.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Promoting Economic Cooperation between China and Japan</h3>
<p>The Japan-China Friendship Economic Delegation, led by Mr. Masatsune Ogura, is visiting China, which is of great significance to the advancing new relationship between China and Japan.</p>
<p>The return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality have made China a truly independent country. If China wants to adapt to this new national status, the revitalization of its economy is an indispensable condition. And for the revitalization of the economy, external assistance is indispensable. In this regard, there is no other place to seek help but Japan. The arrival of this economic survey team is precisely in line with this inevitability.</p>
<p>The participation of the National Government in the war indicates that China and Japan are working together to complete the war and build the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The road for China to complete this important task mostly lies in the economic aspect, which is universally recognized. Therefore, economic cooperation between China and Japan is of even deeper significance. Chairman Ogura said: "Judging from the nature of the current world war, the Greater East Asia War cannot be completely won, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is impossible. If the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is not successful, how can we seek the welfare of the East Asian nations?" These words are indeed profound.</p>
<p>What, then, is the specific mission of the delegation? First, the delegation should frankly exchange opinions with Chinese economic people on the mutual relationship between the economies of China and Japan. Second, the delegation should frankly and publicly disclose Japan's experience in controlling the economy. Sincerely guide the Chinese economic community. Third, the delegation should also strive to promote the smooth communication of wills between the National Government and the Chinese economic community. In other words, the delegation should fully understand the opinions of both parties, so that the views of both parties are consistent, developed, and can contribute to the revitalization of the Chinese economy.

<h3>Japanese Troops on New Guinea Island Launch Counterattack Against Landing Enemy Troops Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Cooperate to Launch Three-Dimensional Attack, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 pm on the 8th: The Japanese garrison near Salamaua in southeastern New Guinea Island has been conducting counterattacks against the American troops landing at Nassau Bay and the Australian troops advancing from Wan since June 30th. On July 5th, they ambushed the enemy's rear near Bobdubi, causing them to collapse. The Japanese air force also attacked the enemy at Nassau Bay on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th, inflicting great losses on the enemy's boat groups and landing points. Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) According to military experts here: Since June 30th, in order to carry out a counterattack in the Pacific waters with powerful troops, the American troops landed on the Solomon Islands, Lombard Island, and New Georgia Island to carry out a counterattack. They are currently engaged in fierce three-dimensional battles with the Japanese army, navy, and air force on land, sea, and air, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters at 3:30 pm on the 8th. On the day the American troops landed on Lenteba Island, they also landed at Nassau Bay in southeastern New Guinea Island. At the same time, the Australian troops cooperated with the American troops and advanced from the Wan side. The Japanese garrison in Salamaua immediately launched a counterattack against the enemy. Especially on the 5th, they ambushed the enemy's rear near Bobdubi, causing them to collapse. At the same time, the Japanese air force also cooperated with the ground forces and bombed the American troops in Nassau Bay fiercely for three days on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th, sinking a large number of American boats and severely damaging their docks. In the ten-day battle, many American aircraft were shot down. The landing of American troops on Lenteba Island, New Georgia Island, and Nassau Bay, and the advance of the Australian troops on the Wan side, are obviously carried out under a joint operation. The enemy's counterattack this time, judging from their combat intent, troop strength, and equipment, should not be underestimated. However, the Japanese garrison has integrated with the army, navy, and air force and is launching fierce counterattacks. Since June 30th, the Japanese troops in that area have shot down more than 128 American aircraft and sunk many of their ships. The loss of their personnel has actually reached more than 11,000.</p>
<p>Penochi Allez, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 7th: (1) The Japanese air force bombed the Anti-Axis forces' positions in Penapena, New Guinea Island, (2) The Japanese army attacked an Anti-Axis convoy in the Heraflara Sea.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) According to Australian sources: The Japanese air force bombed Darwin Harbor heavily on the 6th.</p>
<p>One American Ten-Thousand-Ton Ship Sunk in Kula Bay</p>
<p>Penos Erler, Central News Agency According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy Department announced on the evening of the 7th: The U.S. cruiser "Helena" was sunk by the Japanese fleet in the Kula Bay naval battle on the morning of the 6th. The "Helena" was launched in August 1938 and commissioned the following year. It was a new U.S. cruiser with a displacement of 10,000 tons, equipped with fifteen 5.2-inch guns, eight 12.7 cm anti-aircraft guns, four 4.7 cm guns, eight 4 cm anti-aircraft guns, and four amphibious on-board aircraft. The normal crew was 888 people.</p>
<h3>Indian Independence League Announces Establishment of Indian National Army Determined to Fight for Independence</h3>
<p>Shaofu, 8th (Central News Agency) The headquarters of the Indian Independence League announced at 3:00 pm on the 8th the establishment of the Indian National Army, expressing the determination of the Indian people to fight for independence. The main idea is: The Indian Independence League in East Asia established the National Army on the 8th, called the "Indian National Army." The Indian National Army is determined to achieve the complete independence of India. The Indian soldiers are also determined to drive the British army out of India in order to complete the sacred and great cause of building "India for Indians."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo Personally Inspects</p>
<p>Shonan, 8th (Central News Agency) The Indian National Army here was inspected by Jiangtela Bose on the 5th. On the 6th, Prime Minister Tojo also inspected the army again. On that day, at 11:20 am, the Indian National Army gathered in front of the city hall square. Indian people welcoming Prime Minister Tojo also gathered. The new leader of the Indian people, Mr. Kangtela Bose, arrived first. Soon, Prime Minister Tojo, followed by Mr. Jiang and other independent volunteers, entered the arena amid cheers and shook hands with Mr. Jiang and others. He also greeted the entire body. The Indian National Army elite and the people all looked at Prime Minister Tojo with grateful eyes. Then, Mr. Jiang stood up and delivered a welcome speech, saying, "We are deeply grateful to Prime Minister Tojo for personally coming to guide us, so our determination to achieve independence is even stronger." His tone was full of enthusiasm and determination to achieve independence. After Mr. Jiang's speech, the inspection began, and a march-past was held. The Indian National Army marched in an orderly manner, and Prime Minister Tojo greeted them one by one as they passed the reviewing stand. After the infantry was the ×× unit. The morale of the entire army was strong, with a strong momentum to march to India. The march-past lasted about 20 minutes. Prime Minister Tojo then had a cordial talk with Mr. Kang in a separate room. Finally, the Indian national anthem was played, and Mr. Jiang and others withdrew from the arena amid cheers from the people.</p>
<p>Commander Bose Encourages Officers and Soldiers</p>
<p>Shonan, 8th (Central News Agency) Jiangtela Bose, chairman of the Indian Independence League and commander-in-chief of the Indian National Army, delivered a speech to the officers and soldiers of the National Army on the 8th when the Indian National Army was announced to be established, encouraging them to work hard. The main idea is as follows: Soldiers of the National Army, today should be one of the most proud days of my life. God has happily instructed me to announce to the world the glorious establishment of the Indian National Army. The Indian National Army has now completed its organization in the ancient battlefield of the Singapore Fortress, which was once the stronghold of the British Empire, and is now the new Shonan. This army should not only break free from the shackles of Britain and strive for liberation, but also be the foundation for building a free Indian army. All the people of India are proud that this army is composed of people under the full guidance of India, and that they will rush to the front line when the major historical moment comes. When the Japanese army began to attack in December 1941, it rushed to Singapore. In the future battles, we should shout to Delhi. At that time, it is still unknown how many of our troops will be able to survive, but I can assert today that the final victory will belong to us. The most regrettable thing about the Indian resistance work so far is that although the atmosphere of Indian independence has gradually formed in all aspects, the first condition is still lacking, that is, there is no army for the liberation of India. But now, thanks to your lead in participating, the Indian National Army has been formed. This is your privilege and honor, and the last obstacle to the future of India's freedom and liberation has also been eliminated by your hands. Therefore, you should be proud to be the pioneers in achieving this sacred goal. I would like to explain here the two major missions of the Indian people in today's war. One is that Indians should not hesitate to make any sacrifices to use force to fight for India's freedom. The second is that they should organize a regular army that is sufficient to permanently ensure India's freedom and independence. In the future, we should build a strong fortress in national defense. You should especially take honesty, duty, and sacrifice as the creed of soldiers, and you must practice it. The most praiseworthy thing in my life has been as described above, and I believe that today, Indians can gain the highest honor in addition to participating in the national liberation war, but I believe that gaining this honor also has a great responsibility. I vow to share my fate with you at all times, and what I ask of you is only active advancement and no sacrifice. If you are willing to follow me forward regardless of life or death, I am sure that you will lead you to victory and freedom. Our only wish is not only to fight for the freedom of some Indians, but to seek the complete independence of India, so we have to prepare all sacrifices for the independence of India.</p>
<h3>British Indian Army Commander Arrives in New Delhi</h3>
<p>Stanford, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from New Delhi: The new commander of the British Indian Army, Auchinleck, arrived in New Delhi on the 6th and immediately took office. When meeting with reporters, he said, "India is now a base for the Anti-Axis Air Force, but the crisis in India is deepening."</p>
<h3>Japanese South China Army Press Officer Discusses the Brutality of American Aircraft Attacking Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) The Japanese South China Expeditionary Force announced at 11:00 am on the 8th that 20 American-stationed Chongqing Air Force fighter-bomber joint formations invaded Guangzhou airspace at 3:05 pm on the 17th, blindly bombing the Dongjiang area and the vicinity of Huangpu. The Japanese air force immediately took off to intercept and shot down two enemy aircraft (one unconfirmed). The remaining enemy aircraft fled to the northwest. The Japanese side suffered no losses in this battle.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) The Japanese South China Expeditionary Force press officer gave a speech at 10:00 am on the 8th regarding the American aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of Guangzhou, the main idea being: On May 8th, the American-stationed Chongqing Air Force indiscriminately bombed Guangzhou city,尽尽暴之能事 (exerting all possible brutality), and this matter is still deeply imprinted in the minds of the people. The United States constantly shouts for justice and humanity, but American aircraft arbitrarily and indiscriminately bombed prosperous streets in the city during the day, injuring more than 1,000 civilians. This kind of brutal behavior is outrageous to both humans and gods. The Chinese people now not only know that the American-stationed Chongqing Air Force's intention is to take advantage of the name of aid to achieve its ambition to dominate China, but they have also personally experienced it. The headquarters of the American-stationed Chongqing Air Force, fearing that its own country and Chongqing would know that it was powerless, announced on July 4th, the anniversary of the establishment of the American-stationed Chongqing Air Force, that the loss of American personnel stationed in Chongqing in the past year was only nine people, and only three people were missing. This kind of fact is completely inconsistent. Even if the American air force personnel who died over Kunming and Zilin are not discussed, the number has already exceeded this number in Guangzhou alone. It is estimated that in October last year, four people were captured in the American aircraft shot down on the Pearl River: Lieutenant Alas, Lieutenant Lunos, Captain Mayup, and Captain Young. In November last year, two people, including Lieutenant Tang Er, were captured in the American aircraft shot down in the Guangzhou area. In the American aircraft shot down in Guangzhou on May 8th of this year, six people, including Lieutenant Plaeman, were captured. Judging from this fact, the intentional concealment of damage by the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing is already very obvious.</p>
<h3>American Air Force Major Shot Down by Japanese</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) According to news from Chongqing, the headquarters of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing announced on the 7th that Major Robard, the squadron leader of the fighter squadron of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing, was shot down by Japanese ground fire while flying alone on a reconnaissance mission over Shishou Huarong on the north bank of Dongting Lake on the 1st.</p>
<h3>Pearl River Navigation Curfew Lifted</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) The Pearl River night navigation, which was previously stipulated to end at 10:00 pm, has been lifted due to the restoration of public order and to increase the shipping capacity. The Guangzhou Japanese Naval Martial Arts Office announced on the 8th that from the 10th of this month, ships traveling to and from the river can freely navigate in the Pearl River, regardless of day or night.</p>
<h3>Japanese Economic Delegation to Go to Nanjing Soon</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) Masatsune Ogura, head of the Japanese-China Economic Delegation, and his party will stay in Shanghai for a while before going to Nanjing. They will also pay respects to Chairman Wang of the National Government and visit various authorities of the National Government to sincerely discuss the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Battle Results of Japanese Troops on Hainan Island</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at noon on the 8th: Since February 21st of this year, the Japanese naval forces in the Chinese Hainan Island area have attacked the enemy troops entrenched in the mountainous area in the northwest of the island. The battle results obtained up to the end of June are as follows: (1) Abandoned corpses: 9,500, (2) Surrendered: 3,600, (3) The Japanese army captured 1,200 rifles, 152,000 rounds of ammunition, 290 machine guns and pistols, 1,866 hand grenades, 30 landmines, and 90 captured ships.</p>
<h3>National Government Declaration of War</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhaoming</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Great East Asia War on December 8th of the year before last, the National Government 据中日基本关系条约之精神 (according to the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty) declared its determination to share weal and woe with the friendly nation of Japan. Since then, it has started the New National Movement and engaged in safeguarding public security and improving people's livelihoods, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Great East Asia War. However, countries such as Britain and the United States still follow their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified it to the point of colluding with Chongqing elements to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India to allow East Asians to kill East Asians. Recently, due to the fact that the 共暴力 (communist violence) has been successively defeated by the armies of the friendly nation Japan, and the bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost, they are even more cunning. They are also jealous of the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the National Government, instigating Chongqing elements to constantly harass them to hinder the progress of various constructions, and even using their own aircraft, using Chongqing as a base, to repeatedly bomb places such as Wuhan and Guangzhou, killing civilians. The Chongqing elements are willing to be driven by Britain and the United States and personally become traitors to East Asia, which is shameful. Britain and the United States, with ulterior motives for East Asia, have done everything possible to sow discord in order to achieve their final desire for annexation. They are especially enemies to the East Asian nations. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States and will do its utmost to cooperate with the friendly nation Japan to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two countries of Thailand and Thailand have always maintained friendly relations, and they are especially of one mind in their efforts to create East Asia. In the future, they should work together to jointly build a new order in East Asia based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been dealing with British and American forces in the West for several years and have repeatedly won the glory of victory. Our country is now participating in the Great East Asia War and should echo each other in order to make a practical contribution to the just new order of the world as a whole. All our people should know that this is the only time to realize the Father of the Nation's Greater Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of 世界全体义义和平 (universal justice, righteousness, and peace) all depend on this. Let us be of one mind and heart, and work together from beginning to end, to carry out the great mission of this great era!</p>

<h3>General Commander Hata Releases Impressions of His Trip to Shandong</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - General Commander Hata of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army previously inspected Japanese military units in Shandong Province on June 21st. After completing his official duties, he returned to this location on June 28th. On the 8th, he hosted a press corps and released his impressions of the inspection, conveying that the spirit of Japan's new policy towards China has been implemented in all aspects of the Japanese military, and is being concretely put into practice. This endeavor has been reflected in the Chinese side, namely, that recently the Chinese side has gradually understood Japan's true intentions and is cooperating with them. The efforts of the current Chinese military and police in maintaining local security are extremely earnest. The provincial and county governments are deeply aware of the importance of their administrative responsibilities and are making every effort to fulfill them. Their communication with the Japanese side is also becoming closer. Recently, there has been a sharp increase in Chongqing's military defecting to support the National Government. The crops in various parts of Shandong Province have grown well this year, promising a bountiful harvest, and the security in various places is extremely solid, which is deeply gratifying. During my inspection trip, I also made a detour to Qufu to pay respects at the Temple of Confucius, and learned that the area has been repeatedly subjected to war for more than a thousand years without being destroyed, which deeply impressed me with the greatness of the latent power of Confucianism.</p>

From this statement, it can be seen that due to some party members advocating changing the party's national central policy, while others insisting on continuing the international movement, they have split into two factions, leading to opposition.</p>

He was considered President Roosevelt's special plenipotentiary representative, with the special mission of acting as an "observer" on behalf of the Soviet Union and the Baltic states. He was recalled after only one year in office because he spoke carelessly on issues of Eastern policy.</p>
<h3>Tank Battle Unfolds on the Kursk Front; Germany Claims to Have Broken Through the Main Soviet Defense Line</h3>
<p>Stockholm Capital, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The largest tank warfare since the opening of the Eastern Front has occurred today. Berlin announced that yesterday the German army destroyed over 400 Soviet tanks and 193 aircraft. Moscow reported that the battles in the Belgorod and southern Orel regions were unprecedentedly fierce, with massive tank attacks and incessant air battles continuing to intensify. Berlin stated that both sides were fully engaged in air combat in the Kursk area, with an unprecedented number of aircraft being used. The Soviet army has also joined the battle with a huge number of tanks never used before. It is said that the four hundred tanks lost by the Soviet side were destroyed by the German army's anti-aircraft artillery units and dive bombers and fighter planes. The Soviet army lost 830 aircraft in three days of fighting, while Berlin claimed that only 54 aircraft were lost. Berlin further claimed that the Soviet Union's strong defense system was broken through by the German army after yesterday's fierce battle. German dive bombers and fighter planes provided great assistance to ground combat units at any time and place. After enduring the Soviet offensive for two days, the German army switched to a counter-offensive and broke through several main Soviet lines in a fierce war.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Huitong News Agency's military correspondent stated: On the third day of the Kursk battle, as a result of the German army's penetration into the Soviet army's strong echelon defense positions, the front lines north of Orel and south of Belgorod have been greatly shortened. Although this semi-circle, where 400,000 elite Soviet troops are located, is still supported by extremely powerful tanks and artillery units, it is strategically the most dangerous position for the enemy. Currently, the German army has broken through the Italian army's front line between Orel and Mtsensk, while another German unit has also attacked the Soviet defense line further south of Belgorod. The Soviet position is showing an increasingly unfavorable trend, so the Soviet army is currently attempting to attack the German front line in the west of the semi-circle to avoid the German army's flanking maneuver. The focus of the fighting on Wednesday was still on the north and south flanks, and the Soviet offensive was repelled by the German army in many places. The fact that the Soviet army has gathered such a large number of elite troops in the Gulf of Donets shows that it intends to launch a large-scale offensive there to improve its military strategic position. Currently, Soviet airfields in Kursk are crowded with aircraft, so it can be concluded that the ultimate goal of the Soviet offensive is to recapture Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the Kursk battle has not yet reached its peak. The Soviet offensive has achieved nothing this time. In fact, this is the third time the German army has changed from a defensive to an offensive position on the Eastern Front. The first time was in May 1942, when Marshal Timoshenko's offensive in Kharkiv caused a German counter-offensive. The second time was still in the Kharkiv area, in March of the 3rd year of Showa, when General Manstein led elite troops in a counter-offensive in the Donets Basin and Poltava, and finally recaptured Kharkiv.</p>
<p>Before the German army launched its offensive in Kursk this time, it had already detected the Soviet army's intentions, so it had gathered sufficient forces in Orel and Belgorod. The German army in this area is well-equipped, and the enemy is also using new tanks in combat. Both sides are using new weapons, so the development of the Kursk battle this time can test the effectiveness of the new weapons. At the same time, both sides are using strong artillery and large air forces in combat, which is also a feature of this battle. Currently, the intensity of the air battle in the Kursk area is unprecedented on the Eastern Front. The German army has deployed more aircraft than the British and Americans used in Tunisia, so the German air force has a great advantage in Kursk, and air supremacy fell into the hands of the German army yesterday.</p>
<h3>Materials Investigation Committee Conducts Regional Investigations into Hoarding</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the Supreme National Defense Council approved the organizational regulations and list of members of the Materials Investigation Committee, the committee has now opened an office in Shanghai. A total of 15 investigators have been selected and dispatched separately by the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Japanese Consulate General, the Japanese Military Police, the Public Concession Work Bureau, and the French Concession Municipal Council. The Mayor of Shanghai serves concurrently as the chairman of the committee to investigate important hoarded materials, and has held meetings to discuss specific investigation plans and the legal disposal of investigation results. It is reported that the investigation principles are: (1) Chinese and Japanese investigators will investigate their respective nationals separately, so the work is progressing quite smoothly; (2) the urban area, the Public Concession area, and the French Concession area will be investigated separately, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. If evidence of hoarding of important national materials is found, it will be dealt with in accordance with the regulations on punishing hoarding.</p>
<h3>Famous German General Commands Battle with Over a Million Troops on Both Sides</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the announcement of the German Chief of Staff Headquarters at noon on the 7th, the offensive and defensive battle in the Kursk salient has been fiercely fought for three days. The characteristics have now been determined: (1) After the winter battle, the German and Soviet armies gathered large forces in this area. It is estimated that the strength of the German and Soviet armies gathered in this area is over one million, with about a thousand tanks. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the German army has an absolute advantage in armored and air power compared to the Soviet army. This is evidenced by the fact that the Soviet Union lost 190 tanks on the 7th alone, which shows that this is indeed the case. (2) In terms of air supremacy on the front line, this can be seen from the fact that the Soviet army lost 140 aircraft on the 7th alone, while the German army lost only 8. The air supremacy on this line has completely fallen into the hands of the German army. According to the German military authorities, the ratio of the German air force to the Soviet air force is 14 to 1. (3) Both sides have used heavy and light artillery fire to the maximum extent in this operation. The German military authorities also said, "The scale and intensity of the artillery battle are unprecedented." (4) According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the German commander directly directing the battle in the Kursk salient is Marshal Kluge. Kluge established special merit in the Battle of Flanders in 1940. In 1941, he appeared on the Eastern Front and demonstrated his super special mobile tactics in the battles of Bialystok, Minsk, and Smolensk. Therefore, Marshal Kluge is the first-class famous general of the German army.</p>
<h3>Axis Powers Still Maintain Air Superiority in the Mediterranean; Fierce Air Raids on Port Said</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency, German military personnel believe that the fierce air battles in the Mediterranean in recent days, especially in Sicily and Sardinia, have sufficiently proven that the Axis air force still holds an advantage there. The British and Americans also admit that repeated attempts to destroy the Italian airfields in this area have had the opposite result. The Axis powers' defenses are becoming stronger as they fight. It is estimated that the British and Americans lost 52 aircraft in the above two places on the 3rd of this month, 56 on the 4th, and 51 on the 6th, most of which were four-engine bombers. The Axis powers only lost 16 aircraft in these three days. Britain now also admits that the Axis powers' defenses are extremely strong. When 30 Allied aircraft attempted to bomb Gampini in Sicily, they were intercepted by more than 100 Axis fighter planes. As for the losses suffered by the Axis air force claimed by the enemy, eyewitnesses have been able to prove that they are false and purely fabricated.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A special correspondent of the German News Agency commented on the battle in the Mediterranean region: According to observations made by German reconnaissance aircraft personnel on Wednesday, strong units of German bombers launched a fierce attack on the port of Said on the evening of June 6, causing major damage to the enemy. A portion of the German aircraft flew low over the entire port to attack, causing a serious blow to one of the most important artillery batteries of the Anglo-American fleet. In addition, several enemy ships moored in the port or outside the breakwater were also directly hit by heavy bombs and suffered heavy damage. Most of them can be considered lost. At the same time, the Anglo-American air force continued to bomb Sicily yesterday. Seventeen enemy aircraft were shot down by German and Italian fighter planes and anti-aircraft artillery units. The reporter Song claimed that the Anglo-American air force has lost no less than 176 aircraft in the past four days of bombing Italian cities, most of which were four-engine bombers.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Forces Concentrating to Prepare for the Invasion of Europe</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A special correspondent of the German News Agency stated that according to reliable sources, the Anglo-American fleet, including several ships of the British King George class, has sailed westward from the Port of Gibraltar. It is not yet known what relationship this move has with the invasion of Europe. What is known is that the strength of the anti-Axis fleet in the Mediterranean has indeed greatly increased in recent weeks, including several American battleships and aircraft carriers. The number of ships transporting troops to North Africa and the Far East and supply ships has also greatly increased. However, the trend of modern warfare has pointed out that air power alone is not enough to achieve the success of an occupation. Therefore, General Vincent Howard has been trying his best to replenish troops and munitions for eight weeks. The strength of the anti-Axis forces in the Mediterranean, from North Africa to Syria, has gathered 44 divisions of infantry and 15 to 20 tank formations, including two divisions of Anglo-American paratroopers and airborne landing troops, whose mission is obviously to create bridgehead fortresses. This force also includes small tank units attached to motorized infantry units. Bassi said that the above figures seem very daunting at first glance, but after detailed study, it is known that half of this military force must remain stationed in its original locations, especially in Algeria, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and Italian North Africa, because the anti-Axis group must station a strong army in order to maintain its ruling power. Furthermore, a portion of the anti-Axis forces includes Greek, Czech, Serbian, and Syrian troops, whose combat effectiveness is not considered high even by the British and Americans, and the combat effectiveness of this mixed and disorganized army is also questionable. On the other hand, the transportation and transfer of war materials in North Africa must be handled by the anti-Axis forces themselves, because the local workers are insufficient. Furthermore, the roads and railways in North Africa must also be built by the military, and General Eisenhower must also specially train the American army, whose combat effectiveness is not strong. The combat effectiveness of this American army has been proven in the Tunisian campaign. From this perspective, when the anti-Axis forces in the Mediterranean region want to attack Europe, only a portion of the force is available, and this available force must be the best members of the anti-Axis forces. Currently, the Axis powers' defenses have made the anti-Axis powers' tentative invasion of Europe even more dangerous. The anti-Axis powers' attempt to launch an invasion of Europe at the same time as the Eastern Front war is a dangerous move, because the power of the German air force in the Mediterranean is still sufficient to inflict great blows on the invaders.</p>
<h3>German Mail Ship Becomes a Girls' Camp</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The former German luxury liner "Cap Arcona," which served on the South American route, has now become the home of 400 German girls in the naval auxiliary force. They not only sleep on the ship, but also spend most of their time on the ship, especially enjoying the large deck sports field provided by the ship.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in North China</h3>
<p>Since Japan implemented its new policy towards China, it has been followed by the return of concessions, the transfer of enemy property to the National Government for management, and the withdrawal of Japanese instructors from local administrative agencies, as well as accelerating the transfer of occupied area management businesses to China. In North China, measures are being carried out, including the easing and abolition of restrictions on the movement of materials, the abolition of special service agencies, the large-scale withdrawal of Japanese instructors from the New People's Society, and the transfer of the main bodies of livelihood agencies and the Anti-Communist Committee to the jurisdiction of the Chinese side. This proves that Japan's new policy does not distinguish between Central China and North China, but targets the entire China. The existing facts in the North China area, which were built up under the "special nature of North China" by previous policies in North China, are completely concentrated on being a supply base for cooperating in the Greater East Asia War. On what point should the operation of the new policy be adjusted? Below, let's look at various recent situations from what has been seen and heard locally:</p>
<p>(1) Price, Food, and Fuel Problems: The North China Political Affairs Committee previously established a Food Management Bureau under the Price and Materials Adjustment Committee, and established Food Transport Associations in various provinces and special municipalities, in order to establish purchasing institutions and maintain food supply. Furthermore, on the 5th, in order to prevent hoarding, it promulgated regulations on food prices, and implemented a public price system from the 20th.</p>
<p>These measures have all been effective, and food prices have fallen back since the 6th, and are now lower than the prices in March of this year. Furthermore, according to a survey at the end of May, this year's harvest has increased by 20% compared to previous years. This is one point that the food problem can be said to be resolved.</p>
<p>(2) The CCP Problem: As shown in the previous conversation with Commander Ohito of the Japanese army, the Anti-Communist Committee guided by the Japanese side has been dissolved. A new Anti-Communist Committee has been established under the North China Political Affairs Committee to discuss anti-Communist countermeasures in cooperation with the Political Affairs Committee and the New People's Society.</p>
<p>Anti-Communist Committee branches have now been established in various counties, and a fierce struggle has begun against the CCP's political offensive. Si Zhi, the Governor of Shanxi Province, replied to a reporter's question about the CCP as follows:</p>
<p>"The CCP is still continuing its work of three parts military and seven parts political. The CCP's politics, due to its propaganda, truly has considerable charm for the people. This is an undeniable fact, but the existence of corrupt officials and clerks within the CCP is indeed undeniable. They encourage the people to cultivate opium, which is a poison to the people. We strictly prohibited the cultivation of opium in February, and we maintain clean and honest politics against the CCP's corruption. They use opium to poison the people, and we strictly prohibit it. In mid-June, I personally inspected the entire province by plane, and did not see any farmland cultivating opium. This is a barometer of the penetration of the province's political power."</p>
<p>On the one hand, Shanxi Province has also formed a youth team with the nature of a people's self-defense organization, building anti-Communist fortresses and collecting intelligence, which has achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>(3) Labor Problems: Regarding the labor problems of developing important resources such as coal, iron, and stone in the Jin Si and Jinbei areas, North China has always been a world-famous labor supply market, so there is no difficulty.</p>
<p>For example, in the Datong Coal Mine, Chinese and Japanese workers have jointly started increasing coal production in mines hundreds of feet deep, and have already broken the planned amount, but unfortunately the transportation capacity cannot keep up.</p>
<p>(4) Security: Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying, the former commanders of the 24th Army of the National Army, resolutely participated in the peace movement and defeated the Chongqing forces based in the Taihang Mountains. The CCP forces in eastern Hebei, northern Shanxi, and western Shanxi have also been annihilated, and security is improving day by day.</p>
<p>Therefore, the mission of strengthening security in North China has been temporarily completed. From July, a new construction movement in North China will be launched. This movement will thoroughly implement Japan's new policy towards China on the Chinese side. At the same time, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, how to construct North China and how to make it a military base will be the focus of the future.</p>
<p>(5) New National Movement: Since Japan began its new policy towards China, the National Government has comprehensively launched the New National Movement as a step towards building a unified country. From this point of view, it is urgent to break the special nature of North China in order to strengthen the central political power.</p>
<p>Since Chairman Wang's visit to Beijing last autumn, such as the Chairman's assumption of the honorary presidency of the New People's Society, the New People's Society's adoption of the New National Movement, the adoption of the Blue Sky White Sun flag in North China, the participation of the Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee in the Supreme National Defense Council of the National Government, and the amendment of the organizational regulations of the Political Affairs Committee, all are measures to centralize North China. North China also responded to this with the enthusiasm of "no North China, no center; no center, no North China," and moved towards completing the war.</p>
<p>North China originally had two aspects: the first line of anti-communism and the economic core of China, Japan, and Manchuria. The backbone of the new cooperative relationship between China and Japan, including this special North China, should be the principle of equal sharing centered on the efficiency of both countries. In any case, North China should not emphasize its special nature to the National Government, nor should it stand in a special position towards Japan. China, which participates in the war, should develop its special nature in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, in other words, to fulfill the powerful position of a supply base for completing the Greater East Asia War, and work together with the southern peoples to win this great war. This is what North China, the National Government, and Japan should all remember and never forget. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi of June 26)</p>

<h3>Director Tang's Welcome Speech</h3>
<p>Director Tang of the Commercial Control Association delivered a welcome speech, saying: "Today, all the directors and supervisors of the National Commercial Control Association sincerely welcome His Excellency Mr. Ogura, the head of the Japanese Economic Inspection Group, and all the gentlemen. We are very honored by your presence. His Excellency Mr. Ogura and all the gentlemen are powerful authorities in the financial and economic circles in Japan. At the same time, they are responsible for various important tasks in the country. This time, they have temporarily put down their own work and come from afar, which shows that they attach great importance to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and various economic issues in China. We are very grateful for this opportunity to express our opinions on economic issues. Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has been established as a national policy by the governments of both countries. However, how can it be realized? It all depends on the mutual understanding and cooperation between the financial and economic circles of the two countries. China has always been a country with backward production. Whether in industry or agriculture, there is a phenomenon of insufficient production. This is the case in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. Therefore, increasing production is the most important task for China at present. However, if all the conditions are not met and the methods used are not appropriate, not only will the desired increase in production not be achieved, but the opposite result may be obtained. The most important condition for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is that China first has a solid economic foundation, and a solid economic foundation is based on production. Therefore, we hope that the advanced financial and economic circles of friendly countries will help China as much as possible to solve the prerequisites for increasing production, and study various methods for increasing production, especially how to stimulate producers' interest in increasing production. During wartime, it is a matter of course that people should economize on food and clothing. However, the minimum living standards of the people must be maintained, otherwise, not only will production not increase, but it will even decrease. Therefore, with regard to distribution, whether it is the distribution of materials between the two countries or the distribution of daily necessities to the people in the country, a rapid and reasonable adjustment should be made. This is a realistic issue and the basic condition for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Material control has been implemented in name since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association on March 15, but in fact, because the lower-level institutions have yet to be organized layer by layer, and have not yet been perfectly organized until now, the promotion of work still needs to be improved. Material control is an innovation in China. The colleagues who are responsible for the control work lack the knowledge and experience of control, so they are not very confident about the future of the control work. Your country partially implemented material control before the incident and has gradually improved it in recent years, becoming more complete and thorough. This time, experts in trade control are also participating in your country. If you could give us your advice and guidance, so that we can obtain guidance, we would be very fortunate."</p>
<h3>Speech by the Head of the Japanese Delegation</h3>
<p>"I am very grateful for the grand welcome meeting held by the National Commercial Control Association tonight. On behalf of all my colleagues, I would like to express my thanks.</p>
<p>Recalling that the people of our two countries, China and Japan, are not only neighbors in East Asia, but also ethnic groups with the same script and culture. Since ancient times, we have had a relationship of interdependence. Unfortunately, after the invasion of East Asia by Western Europeans, all kinds of complex relationships unknowingly arose between the two countries due to their instigation and counter-espionage, which led to unfortunate events. This is really a matter of regret. Fortunately, Chairman Wang understood the situation, resolutely left Chongqing, moved to Nanjing, and decided to cooperate with Japan to save China from danger and move towards the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. In January of this year, he further declared war on Britain and the United States, expressing his determination to live and die with Japan. China and Japan thus stood on the same front, working together to resist foreign enemies. This is truly unprecedented. Now, in Europe, there is a mutual death struggle between the Axis powers. This can be said to be a major transition period in the history of building a new world order. We are in this environment, and we should do our best to achieve certain victory. We know that to build a new world order, we must first build the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. In other words, before the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is built, the new world order cannot be rebuilt. However, the construction of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere necessarily requires the comprehensive cooperation of China and Japan as the central axis. Among them, economic cooperation is particularly important. This is also what you have already understood. Therefore, the historical mission that our two countries bear in economic cooperation is extremely important and great. The enemy dares to believe in the sincerity of the economic cooperation between China and Japan and the sincere cooperation of economic people. If Chinese and Japanese economic people can trust each other and unite strongly, no matter how difficult the future is, it can be solved easily. If so, the construction of the East Asia Economic Co-prosperity Sphere will be successful, and the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia can also enjoy peace and live happily, and at the same time, a brilliant new world order can be completed at this time. Furthermore, how can economic people in both countries sincerely trust each other? Of course, it is from using an equal attitude, mutually understanding each other's position, respecting personality, and starting with frank discussions. The purpose of our visit to your country this time is nothing more than the above-mentioned points. We are able to meet with authoritative people in the economic circles of your country and express our sincere congratulations to your country for breaking away from the shackles of Britain and the United States for a hundred years due to the recovery of concessions, and for the bright China. We also have the privilege of listening to various frank opinions, hoping to strengthen the foundation of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Therefore, we in Shanghai hope to exchange views with all parties as much as time permits. We are very grateful for the grand banquet tonight. Now, I would like to borrow the host's wine to wish the National Commercial Control Association development."</p>
<h3>Restaurants and Hotels Without Rice Allocation Permits Not Allowed to Serve Meals</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department recently issued a notice stating that from the 9th of this month, all restaurants and hotels that have not obtained a rice allocation permit from the Public Works Department to serve customers are strictly prohibited from selling meals to customers in any way. Violators will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Opportunity for Rehabilitation Given to Arrested Grain Merchants; 200,000 Stones of Joint Venture Rice Soon to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>On the 5th, the authorities learned that a large number of "rice bugs" were gathering at the Deyi Building in the City God Temple in Nanjing, engaging in illegal trading. They were immediately arrested, numbering more than 100. Except for a small number who were released on the spot, the rest were detained for investigation. They were still trying to justify their actions and escape punishment. After the authorities examined their identities one by one, they proved to be grain merchants and were given severe punishment. Now, the authorities are giving them an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, so they have all been released yesterday. According to a Shanghai News reporter, more than 30 staff members sent by the Rice and Grain Joint Venture to rice-producing areas such as Suzhou, Wujiang, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Changshu, Huzhou, and Yangzhou a week ago are contacting the authorities in these areas day and night to negotiate purchases. About 200,000 stones from Suzhou, Yangzhou, Huzhou, and other places are already on the way to Shanghai and should arrive in the market in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Eight Oil Mills Have Started Production</h3>
<p>Since the wholesale office of the edible oil industry implemented average allocation, various parties have been expecting an increase in supply. It is now heard that the oil mills in this port are stepping up efforts to increase production in order to promote smooth supply. In addition to undertaking the oil raw materials of the military allocation group, they are also directly purchasing oil raw materials from various production areas. Currently, the companies that have started production include Yoshida, Manyu, Nikka Coating, Kawaminami Oil &amp; Fat, Lisheng, and Taishan, totaling eight. There are also Dayouyu and Dadexin on the Chinese merchant side, which are also preparing to start production once the raw materials arrive in sufficient quantities.</p>
<h3>10,000 Tons of Coal Bricks to Be Shipped to Shanghai from Production Areas; Fuel Market Situation Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>The fuel market situation in this city has gradually improved, and residents can purchase the fuel they need daily in the vicinity. According to coal industry news yesterday, a large number of coal bricks will be shipped from the production area to this area in the coming week, with a quantity of about 10,000 tons. At that time, the number of spot chips in the market will inevitably increase sharply, and the bottom line is expected to gradually increase. Therefore, there is no shortage of fuel supply in this city.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Ship Begins Service on Shanghai-Ningbo Route</h3>
<p>Although there are Xin Ningshao, Changshan, Wanji, and Hualin ships sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo, due to the large number of passengers and the crowding of passengers and cargo, tickets are still in short supply. The Dongya Shipping Company has specifically requested the authorities to stop the Changshan and use the "Ningbo" ship that sails on the Shanghai-Hankou route. It is now known that the Changshan ship will stop sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo after sailing to Ningbo on the 9th, and the "Ningbo" ship is scheduled to begin its first voyage on the 20th. Ticket sales will begin tomorrow, and the ticket price will be the same as Xin Ningshao, and the ticket purchase method and procedures will also be handled as before.</p>
<h3>Ancient Tomb from the Ming Dynasty Discovered at the South End of Xietu Road; Whether the Tomb Owner Gu Xinquan, Whose Family Was Poor and Unable to Make a Living, Was a Descendant of Gu Dingchen Is Still Difficult to Ascertain</h3>
<p>It was rumored the day before yesterday that someone had discovered an ancient tomb from the Ming Dynasty behind the Xieji Rope Factory in Nanfu Xinli, south of Xietu Road in Dapuqiao, Nanshi. It was said to be the burial place of Gu Dingchen of Kunshan, a high-ranking official of the Ming Dynasty, and his wife and two concubines. There were countless funerary objects in the coffin, such as gold and silver ornaments, jade jewelry, diamonds, and antique treasures. When the coffin was opened, the deceased's appearance was unchanged. The male corpse wore a gauze hat and python robe, and the female corpse wore a phoenix coronet and robes, with a face as white as jade. After being exposed to the air, it immediately turned black and decayed. The coffin was made of ebony, about a foot thick, and the tomb was very strong. It took the grave robbers two weeks to dig it open. The outside was made of bricks and stones, and the outline was also very strong. When the lid was opened, a stone tablet was revealed, but the words were blurred and unclear. Only the numbers "built in the second year of Hongwu" were slightly clear. It was also heard that the head of the male corpse was fitted with a gold helmet (one said that the corpse was a first-rank official in the court before his death, and was beheaded for a crime, so his children and grandchildren fitted it with a gold helmet and buried it. His wife and concubines all died for him and were buried in the same place.) As a result, rumors spread everywhere in the Xietu Bridge area, with everyone saying something different.</p>
<p>After rushing to the site for inspection, we arrived at the destination and saw a tomb that had been excavated, with four holes in the middle. The holes were full of purple sewage, and the spectators were packed like sardines. The four coffins that had been dug out were temporarily buried in an open space about forty or fifty steps east of the original site. There were also six holes excavated at the east end of the tomb, and it was heard that those buried there were servants of the Gu family. After conducting a detailed investigation, we learned that the tomb owner was Gu Xinquan, 70 years old this year, from Kunshan, No. 29 Caodang Street, Jialiyuan Road South. Recently, due to poverty, the buyer ordered him to relocate the tomb within a time limit, so Gu hired workers to excavate it. According to him, the person buried in the tomb was nine generations away from him, and he only knew that it was a female champion in the Ming Dynasty. The clothes worn by the corpse were a phoenix coronet and robes, and the complexion did not change. The land price was 16,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan was divided equally among the five families, with each family receiving 2,000 yuan. 6,000 yuan was intended to be used for relocating the coffin. The police bureau believed that it should be investigated whether Gu Xinquan had the right to excavate this tomb, and Gu Xinquan has been detained and sent to the court for decision.</p>
<h3>Propaganda Office Recovers Concessions; Propaganda to Be Expanded Within Days; People in Hongkou Hope the French Concession Will Be Accepted at the Same Time</h3>
<p>The Propaganda Office of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government has already started working, and has an entire plan for expanding propaganda on the recovery of concessions, and has decided to implement it within days. Furthermore, the Hongkou District Party Department, in gratitude for the perseverance of friendly Japan, which scheduled the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, specifically convened a meeting of the executive committees of various branches on the 7th of this month and solicited the opinions of the people in the entire Hongkou District. According to the reports of the executive committees of various branches, millions of people in Hongkou deeply hope that the government will follow the teachings of the National Father and quickly formulate a plan to recover the French Concession on August 1st. Millions of people in Hongkou will provide support. After receiving the report, the Hongkou District Party Department specifically requested the Municipal Party Department to forward it to the Central Government.</p>
<h3>Press Association to Relocate</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Press Association has spared no effort in promoting association affairs. Recently, because the original address was not enough, the board of directors approved a request to the military authorities for permission to use the original address of the former English Continental Daily at No. 160 Edward Road as the association's address. After the directors selected appointed Rigao Lufeng, etc. as the receiving committee, they went with the secretary-general of the association, Ren Yunpeng, and members, etc., to seal and receive it with the assistance of the naval authorities yesterday. It is said that once the interior is cleaned up, it will officially open its office there.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department Closes; Feng Jie Talks; Assists in Propaganda Work in Shanghai as Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan meeting approved the closure of the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department. The Propaganda Department announced that it had hired Feng, the director of the office, as an advisor and assisted and guided propaganda work in Shanghai as the Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department. It is said that Feng visited Beijing a few days ago to ask for instructions and returned to Shanghai, and then proceeded to close the office. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited him, and he announced the following remarks: "The Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department was ordered to close. From now on, the propaganda activities in Shanghai will be handled by the Propaganda Office established by the municipal government. I recall that I came to Shanghai at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War and ended at the time when the concessions were decided to be returned. During this period, I was very happy to be able to participate in the work of this sacred and great era for more than a year, and I am especially grateful for the assistance of the authorities of friendly countries, the cooperation of people in the press and cultural circles, and the cooperation of people from all walks of life, which enabled me to complete my tasks. In the future, I will work harder to establish the foundation of the Chinese film industry, and I hope that all parties will continue to provide assistance and guidance."</p>
<h3>Road Police Department Advises to Protect Travelers</h3>

It is now known that a small number of people have failed to deeply understand the intentions of the Management Office and still violate national laws and move prohibited items. The Office sincerely hopes that the people will cooperate closely, do not engage in illegal activities, and achieve the government's aim of cherishing railway transportation and protecting travelers, as well as the hard work of friendly cooperation.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Baojia Work in Pudong and Chuansha Districts</h3>
<p>The Municipal Baojia Committee believes that the baojia organization in the urban area is not yet thorough and strengthened, so it has not been able to fully exert the effectiveness of the baojia, so it has ordered its subordinate districts to conduct separate investigations on record. It is now known that the Baojia Offices in Pudong and Chuansha districts have actively launched adjustment work after receiving orders. In addition to strictly ordering the Pudong South District to complete the reorganization within two months, the Municipal Baojia Committee has set a deadline for Chuansha to complete the adjustment before the 20th of next month.</p>

This newspaper's scholarship movement is what poor children are looking forward to, so the number of young people applying for scholarships is close to 10,000.

<h3>This Newspaper Hosts Charity Art and Calligraphy Exhibition - Registered with the Authorities - Shen Bao Cup Fundraising Ends</h3>

We have registered with the Police Headquarters and originally intended to hold the exhibition earlier to meet the expectations of all parties, but we have been delayed due to the difficulty in finding a venue. We feel deeply ashamed.

<p>The "Shanghai Citizens Consumer Cooperative Society," initiated and organized by the city's industrial and commercial leaders, is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on Saturday, the 17th of this month. However, the society's future method of distributing goods may not be based on district distribution, as this method may cause trouble for each member. It is currently under research, and it is planned that suppliers will directly deliver goods to the society's members. However, whether this method will be officially implemented is still to be decided. As for the society's current distribution of goods, it will be temporarily limited to essential items, such as rice, flour products, cigarettes, matches, candles, soap, coal and briquettes, sugar, soy sauce, cooking oil, salt, silk and cotton products, tea, firewood, meat, vegetables, eggs, fresh fish, preserved meats, leather shoes, knitwear, stationery, and paper. In the future, the market price will be lower than that sold on the market. Once these goods are distributed, they are strictly limited to personal use, and resale for profit is strictly prohibited. If such a situation occurs, membership will be revoked, and no further goods will be supplied.</p>
<h3>Special Alert in This City to be Lifted This Midnight</h3>
<p>The various police authorities in this city have been implementing special alerts since the 4th of this month, for a period of five or six days. Today (the 9th) is the last day. During this alert period, the police have also taken special alert measures, increasing the number of guards and maintaining watch all night, and have also implemented district lockdowns. It is reported that if there are no special incidents today, these measures will be lifted at midnight.</p>

<h3>Administrative Yuan Approves Competent Authority for the Movement of Prohibited Goods and Materials</h3>
<p>Regarding the Interim Regulations on the Prohibition of the Movement of Wartime Materials, the original text of Article 5, paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, did not separately list the approval agencies for the prohibited items listed. It has now been learned that the Executive Yuan has approved that the "weapons and ammunition" and "gunpowder and its raw materials" in the first and second paragraphs should be under the jurisdiction of the Military Affairs Commission, with the gunpowder raw materials saltpeter and sulfur under the jurisdiction of the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau, and the "opium and narcotic drugs" in the third article should be under the jurisdiction of the Anti-Smoking Bureau. The Executive Yuan has issued an order to all provincial and municipal governments to forward instructions for compliance. Furthermore, it is known that after the City Government received the previous order, the Economic Bureau issued a notice for general knowledge.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Ordered to Prepare for Reopening</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, which has been suspended for a long time since the incident, recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, stating: "Shanghai is the leading industrial area in the country. The exchange has been in a state of suspension due to the impact of the incident for several years. In order to rectify securities circulation and stabilize the financial foundation, it is ordered to prepare for reopening as soon as possible." It is learned that after receiving the order, the exchange has scheduled a temporary shareholders' meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 2:00 PM on the 24th of this month to discuss amending the articles of association, increasing capital, electing directors, and other matters related to the resumption of business.</p>
<h3>Materials Adjustment Committee Appoints Investigators</h3>

<h3>Business Association Promotes Unified Purchase of Wheat</h3>
<p>The unified wheat purchase plan previously set by the Business Association has now entered the implementation stage. The wheat purchase and transportation work in various regions is being actively carried out. In addition to sending letters to the food bureaus of various provinces and cities to assist in the implementation, three measures have been stipulated for the movement of wheat: Those moving into Shanghai must have a permit issued by the association. Those moving within the jurisdiction must have an invoice from a member firm of the local chamber of commerce. Those moving within the territory of the three provinces and two cities (excluding Shanghai) should have a certificate from the industry association and the local office of the association's flour and wheat professional committee, and a permit issued by the food bureau of each province and city. If it is a Japanese merchant, the permit will be transferred from the consulate. Furthermore, regarding the funds needed by the association to purchase wheat, repeated discussions have been held with various banks, and it is reported that a syndicate for wheat purchase loans has been organized and a loan contract has been signed. These funds can be used, and it is expected that the wheat purchase work this year will have satisfactory results.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Applying to Move Flour Sacks</h3>
<p>The number of flour sacks used each year is very large. For the sake of prudence, the Business Association has strictly stipulated the following procedures for applying to move them: Flour sacks, regardless of whether they are new or old, must be printed with trademarks and the names of companies and firms, and must be sewn completely. If they are new bags, a purchase invoice must be provided, indicating the date of purchase and the factory that produced them, as a basis for verification. Flour sacks, in addition to being certified by the Silk Industry United Association and the Flour Industry United Association, must also be sent to the Cotton Products Industry United Association for careful inspection and certification. The procedures for moving other industrial fabrics are also handled in accordance with this principle.</p>
<h3>Measures for Moving Edible Oil</h3>
<p>Regarding the movement of edible oil and various oils in and out, according to the regulations of the Business Association, certificates are issued temporarily limited to edible oil. All edible oil moved from the three provinces and two cities to North China and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River must be certified by the Edible Oil Industry United Association of each region to ensure that the applicant is a member firm before an acknowledgment letter can be issued.</p>
<h3>Authorities Thoroughly Investigate Speculation, and the Black Market Calms Down</h3>
<p>Recently, some speculative merchants have been spreading rumors and acting wildly, causing prices to soar and severely affecting people's livelihoods. Since the authorities have strictly investigated and banned them, things have calmed down slightly. The heat of cash transactions has become particularly intense, and illegal money houses, banks, and speculative merchants are all engaged in speculative trading, resulting in a rampant cash black market. In order to actively stabilize the financial situation and thoroughly eliminate cash speculation, the authorities have sent personnel from the Municipal Council's Materials Control Bureau to inspect the account books of illegal banks and money houses to thoroughly investigate the truth about speculation. It is reported that the account books of several illegal banks and money houses have been taken away for verification to facilitate investigation, and secret personnel have been dispatched to investigate. Therefore, yesterday, the cash black market has calmed down, and the financial situation is expected to become more stable day by day.</p>
<p>According to a letter from the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association yesterday: Regarding the news in your newspaper yesterday about "the authorities cracking down on disguised handling fees," it is inconsistent with the facts. The cash black market was not created by our industry, but is entirely manipulated by general speculators, who engage in speculative transactions with each other. However, in order to maintain our capital and the livelihood of our employees, we have submitted a request to the authorities to increase handling fees to subsidize our operations. Our industry also hopes for this. Therefore, we have specially prepared a letter to make corrections.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks plummeted and then suddenly soared, making rapid progress. Gold and yarn and other industries also stalled. Funds are flowing in. Department stores are the most concentrated target of new and old investors. The New-New Company soared after seeing low prices, and its increase was greater than that of Wing On. National products had little trading. Underwear was squeezed. King Lun shirts and jackets rose again. The trading price of King Fook was the same as the previous day. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile had a difference of 50 points on the day, but it finally rose after being squeezed. Small denominations of Da Guangming, Xinhe, Xinfeng, Guoguang, Guoxin, Da Zhonghua, Meilun, etc. were all favored by investors. Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories were reaffirmed to be firm. Rongfeng Textile rose the most sharply. The new pharmaceutical industry also saw prosperity. Zhongfa returned from outside Guanwai, and Xinya rose significantly. Wuzhou, Zhongxi, and Xinyi all presented a stable situation, but trading was scarce, and it was temporarily forced by sellers. The cultural industry was relatively flat. The Commercial Press and the World Book Company both saw declines. Zhonghua still stood at the original price. Nanyang Tobacco Company was stable and firm. Da Zhonghua Match rose sharply. Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric returned to the same level as the previous day after falling. Jiuan Industrial, Da Zhonghua Industrial, Tongyixin Trust, Defeng Knitting, Zhongxing Wood, Xinya Construction, and Huafeng Enamel were all in greater demand than supply, and the market was very firm.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn: The market was sluggish, and almost no yarn was traded, forming a situation of having a market but no trading. The price of 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix remained unchanged. The 32-count double-strand Fairy Peach was slightly higher. The 32-count double-horse bank order and the 20-count red double-horse were slightly lower.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Today's rise came too quickly, causing sellers to suffer more losses than profits, so they maintained a wait-and-see attitude. Solid Soap was slightly lower. Scissors Bai Xiangmao remained the same. Yang Candle Bai Lishi was firm. Monk Hat was slightly lower. Miscellaneous brands were unchanged. The cigarette market continued to rise because the customer gang still had Nawei, and the price continued to rise. British American Tobacco has exceeded the barrier.</p>

<h3>Return of Concessions and Shanghai's Economic Problems - Eradicating Political Speculation and Economic Speculation</h3>
<p>It is still unknown what attitude the Chongqing side and the CCP have expressed regarding the return of the concessions. However, according to reliable sources, the CCP's opinion on this is as follows:</p>
<p>We have always been able to make correct estimates of Japan's military power, political power, and the political power of the Nanjing government. Perhaps only we can make correct estimates of Japan's return of the concessions. Some people think that the return of the concessions is the beginning of Japan's defeat in China, because Japan must advance to Australia, the Soviet Union, and India. Therefore, the return of the concessions can be regarded as a symbol of Japan's defeat in China. We strongly oppose this view. We know that Japan will continue to strengthen the Nanjing government in terms of politics and economy on the Chinese front. The political power of the Nanjing government cannot be ignored. The Chinese citizens of Shanghai are more concerned about the international political situation than the domestic situation. They believe that Japan will be defeated immediately, or that the Nanjing government has no power over the people in this international situation. In short, they are happy and worried because of the international situation. They look on coldly yesterday, cooperate today, and rebel again tomorrow, adopting a political speculative attitude. However, we absolutely do not adopt this political speculative attitude in our work. It should be known that the war of resistance may drag on for twenty or thirty years. We should correctly estimate the enemy's strength, and we must not be happy and worried because of the changes in the international political situation. We must rely on our own strength to build an unbreakable anti-Japanese base. This is our basic attitude towards Japan and the Nanjing government.</p>
<p>The above paragraph is the attitude of the CCP, and what it criticizes is political speculation and economic speculation, which absolutely should be noted. Economic speculation has been experienced by both China and Japan for several months, but after the return of the concessions, if political speculation does not disappear, its impact on Shanghai's economy will be significant. What kind of countermeasures will the National Government take in the future to ensure the sound development of Shanghai's politics and economy is extremely noteworthy. When Chairman Wang attended the Suzhou Clearing the Countryside Work Commemoration Meeting, he expressed his determination to eliminate speculative thinking in Shanghai on the way. To eliminate speculative thinking, it is necessary to establish clean politics and eliminate corrupt officials in order to achieve great results.

<h3>Eagerness to Learn is Akin to Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Sorokin</p>
<p>Wisdom is genius. Genius is a talent bestowed at birth, expressed through the inducement of the environment. However, it is very unfortunate that there are often many people in the world who, due to unfavorable environments, cannot express their innate talents and are therefore frustrated throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Humans – are the masters of the world, so we must not allow our lives to be dominated by the environment. We should strive to carve out a new path in an unfavorable environment.</p>
<p>Romain Rolland once said: "Genius cannot avoid obstacles, because obstacles create genius." Eagerness to learn is the only way to eliminate obstacles and is also the greatest reason for achieving success.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Our achievements are the result of our blood and sweat." Regardless of whether we lack innate talents, we should always make use of our untapped acquired resources - eagerness to learn, because Edison once said: "Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration." In other words, genius is created by effort, so as long as we work hard, we are geniuses.</p>
<h3>National Music Art in Our Country</h3>
<p>— Pan Yangyao</p>
<p>Music can cultivate emotions and transform customs, and its use is extensive and its effect is profound. Since the Eastern expansion of European culture, many scholars have been fascinated by Western music, and have largely neglected national music, which is related to the quintessence of the country, to the point of almost disappearing. It is worrisome to seek in the wild what is lost in ceremony. Professor Wei Zhongle, an expert in national music, is an authority in the field of national music in our country. Mr. Wei has had an artistic talent since childhood. In his youth, he studied ancient music with Mr. Zheng Jinwen, a senior in national music, for more than ten years. His understanding is rich and his attainments are deeper. He has reached the state of perfection in pipa, guqin, and other instruments. He has served as a music professor at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, Hujiang University, and the music director of the Datong Music Society, cultivating talents and earning a reputation in all walks of life. He has traveled to Nanjing, Hunan, Hubei, and Hong Kong to hold solo concerts. Each time he went, he was welcomed by all walks of life, and he always returned with great praise. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, refugees came to this area, and their clothing and food were worrying. Mr. Wei organized a music team to perform in the United States, and all the income was used to relieve refugees. He traveled to major cities in the United States and held more than one hundred concerts. The audience was enthusiastic and welcomed him. The New York Times commented that Mr. Wei's acting skills were comparable to those of the world-famous violinist Kreisler. Major radio stations in the United States competed to recruit him. Mr. Wei broadcast national music. Mr. Wei can be regarded as the pioneer in winning praise from European and American people with national music. Now, North China is suffering from famine and starvation is rampant. The Boy's Department of the Chinese Christian Youth Association, the Qing Tuan Qi, and the alumni association of Aurora High School are deeply concerned about this. They held a music conference, and all the proceeds were used for disaster relief funds for the victims of North China. Their enthusiasm is commendable. The gentlemen of Aurora and the Joint Medical University discussed with Mr. Wei and invited him to co-organize a performance of national music to fulfill the desire of Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai to enjoy Mr. Wei's art. This move will not only greatly benefit the disaster victims in North China, but also has great significance in promoting and popularizing national music.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Elopement"</h3>
<p>— Lu Guang</p>
<p>"The Elopement" is the debut work of Yan Huizhu. As a Peking Opera actor, she retained some of the qualities of Peking Opera in her acting. In the past, Wang Xichun's speech on the screen was completely "Peking Opera-ized," which was a clear example. Yan Huizhu is certainly no exception. "The Elopement" reveals Peking Opera-ization everywhere. Therefore, the excessive acting skills give the audience a novel feeling.</p>
<p>"The Elopement" tells the story of a brave woman who fights for marriage, goes through many tortuous joys and sorrows, and achieves the result of lovers finally getting married. The story has a sense of reality. In this era of great collision of new and old ideas, such stories often occur around us.</p>
<p>Because the story is tortuous, if Zheng Xiaoqiu handles it with a purely comedic directing technique, I believe there will be greater success. Now, under extremely economical editing, the story is explained clearly. The location is shot at the Thin West Lake in Yangzhou. The natural scenery and beautiful pictures are active in the eyes, as if visiting a painting exhibition.</p>
<p>The actors are best with Yan Huizhu. Every move imitates Chen Yunshang's liveliness and innocence, but the voice wave has a Beijing accent, and the pitch of the voice does not seem to express the flow of emotions. Shu Shi is solemn and humorous, and is the most recent performance. Ouyang Shafei is also a very promising actor, with natural expressions and unlimited potential. Jia Ziqiu still needs to work hard, and Yue Wei is old and lacking.</p>
<p>In short, Yan Huizhu's cameo appearance has not disappointed the audience in general. If she can make one or two more films, perhaps her acting skills will be further developed.</p>
<h3>Arriving Home</h3>
<p>— Yang Shugang</p>
<p>Ten miles from home, the mountains and rivers are getting closer, the journey is still in the box, the clothes suddenly feel new. The original scenery has not changed, the gentleman has fallen mostly because of Chen. Welcoming and asking the elders, the eyes of the young people are confused. Shouts of joy move across the wall, and meetings show sincerity. The neighbor spreads the news, and the four neighbors stop my wheels. The sister-in-law says to prepare food, and the mother releases me from the middle. The crowd gathers from all sides, and the courtyard is in chaos for a while. I am ashamed of my depression on this trip. I have not yet comforted my relatives. But I said that I am well, and the wanderer has many hardships.</p>
<h3>Chicken</h3>
<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>The three of them stared at each other for a long while. Finally, Village Chief Li spoke first, saying:</p>
<p>"Then how exactly should we resolve this? To be honest with you! He—" pointing at A-Kun in the corner of the room, "is an extremely poor person. You've taken it out on the wrong person. We spent the whole evening running around for him, and we had to mortgage his only small plot of land to get some money. The amount is of course not much, but in our opinion, it was already very difficult. Just now, listening to the Commander's tone, it seems he wants to give him a heavy beating, which is absolutely impossible. Even if you beat him to death, you can only say it was his destiny." Village Chief Li finished speaking in one breath, staring intently at Staff Officer Zhang with fiery eyes.</p>
<p>"This whole thing was stirred up by that little cook. Because the Commander wanted to eat something special, but the kitchen didn't have it ready, he sent this kid to the countryside to figure something out. Who knew that the fool went for half a day, then ran back crying, saying that there were chickens, but the people wouldn't let go, and he was even scolded and slapped twice. He exaggerated it a lot. Then the cook ran to the Commander and also exaggerated the story. This enraged the Commander, who immediately sent some brothers to bring this person back with the little cook. Although I clearly knew they were making trouble, what could I do to stop them? Now that things have turned from false to true, we have no choice but to play along. Village Chief Li! Don't get angry. How much money did you actually manage to get? I think it's best to settle this." Staff Officer Zhang seemed impatient and also quite indignant, finally getting to the main point.</p>
<p>"How much money? Only six hundred yuan. It took both of us persuading Old Man Huang on the east side of the river." Village Chief Li was already experienced in worldly affairs and knew that the more people on the team, the the better, so he understated the amount by two hundred yuan, leaving room for further demands. Staff Officer Zhang listened, revealing a bitter smile, and said:</p>
<p>"That's awkward! This amount has never happened before. The Commander will definitely not be satisfied. Even if I go to plead, I'm afraid I'll get scolded too. What should we do!" After speaking, he lowered his head, glancing sideways at A-Kun tied up in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>At this time, although A-Kun couldn't hear clearly what the three people were talking about, he vaguely understood something, likely about what would happen to him. He was also very tired and didn't bother to raise his head and worry. Although he was just a villager and had never experienced complicated worldly affairs, in his mind, he was thinking, just because I couldn't get a chicken for free, does that mean you can eat me? However, the fact was that he was already tied up, like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered, unable to move. (7)</p>

<h3>Contribution to the Cleanliness Campaign</h3>
<p>— Hongxiang</p>
<p>Mosquitoes are vectors for transmitting malaria. Anyone with a little bit of hygiene knowledge knows that they must do everything in their power to eliminate them. In Chinese society, people who have mosquitoes are looked down upon. However, the main camp of mosquitoes—beggars—not only do not fulfill their obligation to exterminate them, but also throw them around everywhere on the streets, in the alleys, and under the sun, doing their best to spread them. Passersby who are not careful are harmed. Those who are harmed not only suffer damage to their health, but also lose face, especially children, because they don't know how to avoid them. As this cleanliness campaign is being expanded, I hope that the authorities will take measures to thoroughly eliminate this matter, which not only damages the health of citizens but also affects the appearance of the city, so as to enhance the true meaning of the cleanliness campaign and protect the welfare of citizens.</p>
<p>The privately-run Securities Industry Elementary School has recently established a scholarship program for poor students with free and half-price options: (1) The quota is ten male and female students per grade, from the first to sixth autumn semester. (2) Free: Tuition is completely waived for students from poor families who achieve a score of 85 or higher on the school's entrance exam. (3) Half-Price: Half of the tuition fee is waived for students from poor families who pass the school's entrance exam. (4) School address: 16 East Wangjia Sha Garden, Carter Road, Avenue Road. Telephone number: 31420.</p>
<p>The Wulun Middle School at 597 Chengdu Road has received a donation from the Xiong Chongshan Hall for five full-tuition scholarships for junior high school. The exam will be held at 9:00 AM on July 19th. Register as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Shoubai established the Pei Cai Scholarship to specifically support poor middle school students. Now that the autumn semester is approaching, Mr. Ma will continue to provide assistance to existing middle school students, except for temporarily suspending assistance to new students. Correspondence address: Tongchang Jewelry Store, 465 Foch Road.</p>
<p>The Jingcheng Elementary School in Sicang Li, Zhaojiabang Road, Sicang Road, Nanshi, will offer one hundred free and half-price spots in the next semester. Children of excellent character and scholarship from poor families are welcome to apply for admission (except for first grade). Regulations are available upon request.</p>
<h3>The Old People's Association Seeks Comrades</h3>
<p>— Zhu Juefo</p>
<p>Why is it that ancient cypress and pine trees that have stood for thousands of years, enduring snow and storms, superior to beams and pillars, are not as good as peach and plum trees that have grown into forests in only three to five years? I know the reason, it's not that they are not as good, it's that they don't do anything. Otherwise, how could Jiang Taigong enter the service of King Wen of Zhou at the age of seventy, establish a world-renowned accomplishment, and create an immortal career? Isn't he an old man? If they do something, then today's elders, aren't they the Jiang Taigong of the past? Alas, old but vigorous, my comrades, there are still those who are heroes. Even without a King Wen, reading these few words, you can still be inspired. (Association address: temporarily located within the Confucius Society on Avenue Edward.) (Note: Mr. Zhu Juefo is skilled in painting plum blossoms and orchids, as well as calligraphy. Anyone who wishes to obtain Mr. Zhu's calligraphy, regardless of the piece, please make a donation as you wish. All proceeds will be donated to this newspaper to help the poor and elderly in need.)</p>
<h3>Hou Sheng Society Publishes Science Books</h3>
