<p>社評</p>
<h3>決戰準備期的國際形勢</h3>
<p>國際形勢在最近又呈現錯綜複雜的態勢，新的態勢指示出較大規模的和含有相當決定意義的戰爭，正在由交戰各國積極的準備着了。</p>
<p>在歐洲方面，隨着冬將軍的降臨，蘇聯展開了近於「全面」的反攻；而德國正作有計劃的撤退，從史太林格勒迂圍莫期科約計劃已經暫時放棄，同時還從北高加索退出，積極準備浩今年的春季新攻勢。同樣的意義，軸心國在非洲方面也實行了有計劃的撤退，里比亞地區暫時吸收了英國的軍隊，而集中軸心軍於突尼斯的重點，準備着決定性的戰爭。歸納歐非戰塲的新形勢，可以明白，在表面上，反軸心軍從守勢轉取攻勢，而在實際上，由於東綫以及北非的軸心軍撤退計劃之驚人的完成，在最少的損折之下順利的完成，對於未來戰爭的主動，還能緊緊地把握住。因此，在地中海或在歐洲的任何部份，一旦新的戰爭爆發之時，軸心軍當然有着充分的準備的。</p>
<p>反軸心軍暫時從守勢轉向攻勢，但是這種攻勢，嚴格的說，還是相當脆弱的，這脆弱的根本原因，是由於資本帝國主義和社會主義間的矛盾，這是不可解消的矛盾。所以，英美不僅是終於遲滯未發動「第二戰綫」，而且在軍用品及物資的應援方面，也是非常遲緩而少量的。反軸心軍攻勢脆弱的第二個原因，是英美相互間的矛盾，和英美帝國主義與殖民地民族運動的矛盾，這種矛盾並不能因爲「大敵當前」而解決；它是繼續發展着的。前者的例子，表示在北非方面，以英國爲背景的特戈爾和以美國爲背景的季勞特兩者之間的衝突。後者的例子，是印度問題的僵持，以及英美援渝的虛僞性。（例如一九四二年度美國租借法案執行實績，對渝租借，只佔全額的百分之三而已，這連美國的報紙也指爲「太可憐了了」。）這些矛盾，造成了反軸心軍所謂攻勢的脆弱性，因此，在未決戰的考慮之下，有急求補救的必要，於是，卡薩勃朗加羅邱會談的一慕演出了。會談的主題，自然以戰略居首要位置，一是所謂英美蘇渝軍事會議問題，二是未來作戰方向與方略問題。政略居次要位置，一是撮合特戈爾與季勞特促成法國反軸心軍的團結，二是誘致中立國的策劃，現在邱吉爾已到土耳共去活動了。羅邱會談的內容就是如此，反軸心軍所謂決戰態勢就是如此。</p>
<p>軸心國針對着這種新形勢，在東綫和北非的行動，第一步表示了戰略上近擊的決意。今後的戰塲，不問爲以突尼斯爲中心的地中海海空戰，或是以東南歐爲中心的大陸戰，或者萬一還是歐洲沿海的作戰，軸心國方面的凖備是相當地嚴整地在期待着了。我們從納粹主政十周年紀念中德國元首的演詞，從昨天報載義大和法西斯領袖墨索里尼的怒吼，都可以證明軸心當局對於迎戰的決心和最後勝利的信心，是如何的堅强。而在這裏，最不容忽視的是大東亞作戰中日本的動態。例如日本國力的集結，南京國府的宣戰，以及南方佔領地區政治的改進，都是趨向於決戰準備勝利的大道。本月二日同盟社電：東條首相闈述作戰目標，昭示；「日帝國決用種種方法，以擊潰敵方戰鬥力，但是不作制覇世界之想，蓋日本之眞意，厥爲在各國間建立共存共榮也。」東條首相指出：「大東亞戰爭爆發一年間，日本已成『有』之國家，其資源已超過英美，而戰鬥力亦迅速增强。反之，英美則在困難迭增之重負下掙扎，在物質上，日本已佔有南方地區之龐大資源，乃奠定必勝的基礎，再東亞各國，均已醒悟，與吾人密切合作。……」而在此反軸心準備所謂攻勢之中，日本則以非常的態勞，首先予英美以打擊，例如引起德報讚揚的一月二十九日日空軍對美陣地的襲擊，誠如東京情報局發言人堀氏所稱：「帝國海軍航空在稜湼爾島外戰役中所獲決定性勝利，實乃日本對英美在卡薩勃朗加會議誇言一九四三年大攻勢之首次强力答覆，已粉碎英美陣營之奢望，而再度證明敵之欲突入日本控制之廣泛區域，胥屬徒勞。」（東京二日同盟社電）實際上反軸心國對於東亞形勢，大都充滿着惶恐的心理，如英國軍事評論家福爾斯撰文刋「倫敦圖畫日報」曾說盟軍收復日本攻佔之區，希望甚微的話。又說：「澳洲與美國在新幾內亞並無勝利。」而泰晤士雜誌也稱「盟國雖極努力，然太平洋軍事並無進展。」澳洲首相寇丁近曾屢次呼籲美國注意太平洋上戰局的嚴重形勢，而給予援助。重慶對於英美之輕視太平洋戰局，更有極大的憂慮，合衆社重慶電即透露「非待美國之接濟品，運輸便利，及其他必需品經陸地運過緬甸，則中國軍隊不致發動。」這種對太平洋戰局的悲觀情緒，充滿於反軸心國之間，更可以反證日本在大東亞作戰及未來決戰中之穩定的地位。</p>
<p>從目前國際形勢來看，從交戰各國決戰凖備的形勢來看，我們不能不指出，歷史上空前的時代，已快臨到我們面前，我們前途的勝利是非常明顯的。然而我們前面途程的艱險，戰鬥的慘烈，以及一切意想之外的困苦，也不能不在這各國決戰中加以注意和警惕，迅速凖備起來。我們要知道？由東亞民族自己來決定命運的日子快到了，然而，一切要看我們所付的代價——所作的鬥爭如何而決定。我們要請求所有東亞各民族一致振作起來，團結起來，準備最後的戰鬥，迎接最後的勝利。</p>

<h3>土耳其否認參戰　保持中立不受任何誘惑　邱吉爾訪問僅宣傳作用</h3>
<p>斯丹埠三日海通社電　土國政府情報處長薩浦、於阿達那會議後、接見新聞記者、絕對否認英國首相邱吉爾曾要求土國參戰、並宣布土國並未接受此項約束</p>
<p>瑞典京城三日海通社電　瑞報駐英京記者電稱、倫敦對土總統伊斯美與英相邱吉爾達在阿那進行談話一事殊表驚異、官方於此未曾置評、僅稱英政府所感興趣者、爲土耳其之保守中立而已、惟英國報紙　咸認該次會議與未來之地中海戰事有關、此可由有英軍界要人參加此次會談一點證之倫敦報紙更有認阿達那會議、爲結包圍德國之鏈者、並稱、伊邱兩氏之會晤、事前必會得斯達林之同意、蘇聯對韃靼尼爾海峽問題、亦殊關切該問題是否亦已在會議中論及、不得而知、惟協約國戰具經韆靼尼爾海峽運蘇之主要障碍、不在蒙特洛條約、而在德國之控制愛琴海、</p>

<h3>德蘇間壯烈之冬季作戰　德軍精銳大展雄威　紅軍力圖反攻未逞</h3>
<p>冬季之東戰塲，德軍陣營果已發動壯烈之戰，德軍及其同盟國軍隊，轉戰於風雪之中，蘇方在斯達林城四周圍攻德軍，同時調集大軍自南·北·中分兵三路，直撲羅斯多夫，聲勢甚盛，德軍力守抵禦，仍未能遏阻其勢，鏖戰惡鬭之中，有不少悲壯美談，據德國宣傳隊員之報吿，前綫將士頗多英勇行動，於此可以想見德軍在大戰以來之防禦戰中，確有驚天地泣鬼神之行動，特黎玻里失守之訊，傳抵前綫，在心理上決無良好印象，但與東戰塲事態之重要性相較，則特黎玻里之失守，尙屬渺小問題，德國國民頗能理解政府所言之國民總力參戰意義，在焦慮緊張情緒中亟盼前綫將士奮發勇戰，密切注視東戰塲之動靜，茲將第二次德蘇冬季作戰之重要情形，作一簡單報吿：</p>
<p>東戰場上形勢嚴重</p>
<p>德軍突於一月二十二日向國民發表東戰塲形勢嚴重，當初德國國民祗知去年十一月起蘇軍開始冬季攻勢，連日在東戰塲激戰，但戰况之詳情不明，當局先則發表：「重創紅軍，擊退其攻擊」，但突於二十二日發表，謂防衛斯達林格勒之德軍，雖英勇作戰，然終不能阻止紅軍之進搫，不得已而栘轉陣地，後退數公里。自承德軍在東高加索戰綫後退，德國國民至此，始知斯達林格勒之德軍，已陷重圍，深感事態不易應付，自作戰以還，過去德軍之發表從無如此不利.德軍於二十三日又有如下之發表　「史達林格勒之德軍，正在敵人重圍中奮戰，北高加索之德軍，向後方移轉，撤退順利」。</p>
<p>二十四日又稱：</p>
<p>「東戰塲命綫之冬季作戰，益趨激烈，斯達林格勒方面，因紅軍自西方進攻，更見惡化，史達林勒格四周之紅軍，雖在逐步縮短包圍網，但德軍將士仍能力守陣地，此種勇敢善鬭之精神，實爲德國軍人之楷模」。</p>
<p>關於北高加索之戰况，坦白發表，承認事態嚴重，不易應付，略謂：「德軍由於戰略上之必要，已將南方戰綫整理縮小，戰塲業已移轉至克彭（譯音）方面」。</p>
<p>紅軍不顧兵力消耗</p>
<p>斯達林格勒德軍在西方之退路，數日前業已被遮斷，致孤立無援而被包圍，但德軍當局何以突然發表，其間另有苦衷。過去三日間德軍發表之消息，與前三日同時開始揭載於德新聞紙上之論調，與前綫PK·從軍記相符。閱讀時，德軍浴血苦戰於大雪狂飛，遍地凍結的戰綫上之景况，可想像得之。去年十一月下旬，蘇軍待地面凍結後，以備有冬季裝配訓練之精銳大軍，首先於南方戰綫開始反擊。德軍於去年冬季戰中業已獲得至可寳貴之敎訓，同樣紅軍亦已經過對付德軍之有效的冬季戰術訓練，使用大量人力與兵器開始攻擊。紅軍從南北二面突破德軍在伏爾加河，頓河間之德軍陣地，以奪還羅斯托夫爲紅軍冬季攻勢目標向前進擊。羅斯托夫要衝奪還後，可遮斷德軍進入高加索之退路，梅谷浦油田地帶及庫彭穀倉地帶，曾一度自德軍手中奪向，同時，攻佔德工業地帶亦為紅軍冬季作戰自標之一，紅軍向羅斯托夫進擊，計有三路：</p>
<p>中央軍沿頓河灣曲部中央之東西行，鐵道向西，北方軍則衝破頓河上流米哥林斯克，加里托夫附近之軸心軍弱點，在米萊洛亘卡門斯克方面直綫南下，南方軍突然出現於加爾姆克洲草原地帶，一隊沿頓河下流，另一隊沿斯達林格勒—克拉斯諾達爾間鐵逍向西進發。</p>
<p>三路皆以數量甚多之戰車隊先發，向德軍占領下熟稔的大雪原地帶突進。德軍在各地堅決抵抗，但中北部戰綫，冬季陣地戰準備不充，南方戰綫，根本未曾預備防禦戰發生，在紅軍優勢兵力及不顧損失之强襲下，不能不作「戰略的後退」，爲避免損失，後退至羅斯托夫設有堅固防禦陣地的地點。</p>
<p>斯城德軍孤軍英勇</p>
<p>數週來對於斯城孤軍食糧彈藥的補給，除空中輸送外，別無他道。去夏激戰後，德軍將士窮寇莫追的苦衷，殊値同情。但對德軍去夏攻擊懷報復心理的紅軍，其包圍圈日趨緊縮，圈內德軍，爲數決不在少，加以前年冬季亦曾有被圍三月的孤軍衝出重圍之先例，唯斯械德軍則盡其最後一彈爲祖國而戰，德國各新聞紙不由不同聲感謝，贈以激勵之辭，恰如戰艦俾思麥號奮戰時之景狀。鑒於兵站補充之困難，紅軍之態勢，戰塲形勢，孤立之德軍，欲奪圍而出，相當困難。且由於嚴冬節令制約，欲援救此孤軍亦不可能，故唯有抗戰到底，以待第三次德軍春季大攻勢之開始，此奇蹟之實現，爲德國前綫後方人十所共懷的憧憬，德國P·K·從軍記者奧斯亙爾特，桑克納爾君，自斯達林格勒向故國新聞界寄送之悽慘戰况，悲壯激昂之慨，溢於字裏行間不菅一首散文詩。</p>
<p>斯達林格勒洪爐之試鍊，鑄成德軍士兵之一種型式。深陷於地獄之陷中的兵士，不愧其名。即在裂熖與爆炸中，我將士之戰鬥精神，依然旺盛不衰，惜人非機械，精力有涯，於此斯達林格勒戰綫中，尙有曾經前年冬季之哈利哥夫戰役，並參加去夏之急進襲擊之士兵，新使命屢落於此等士兵之身，致無從與新戰友交替，中隊大隊聯隊之士兵數。日减一日，外通之道，雖已斷絕，但其精神決不萎縮，所以致此者，唯其本能之自覺而已。不知疲勞，不知精神之破壞，此爲我斯城之勇士，用超人的力量，歷經最慘酷之磨煉，即自身亦明知不克自拔，仍毅然爲祖國爾戰。斯達林格勒之戰，不僅空前，恐將絕後。余等眼前鬥戰，正在最高潮中進行，已達白熱化。</p>
<p>德國輿論一致奮起</p>
<p>紅軍激烈之冬季攻勢，在中部高加索，西高加索，中部戰綫維利基愛·羅基附近，伊爾門湖南方地區，東綫全部各地點，今正在酣戰中。前年冬季軸心軍，即甚以爲苦，然遠不及本年冬季之甚。前年冬季德軍之挫折，可歸咎於德軍對寒冷之襲擊未加準備，本年「冬季陣勢」的特徵，紅軍爲携有可驚的大軍，全副冬裝之大兵力，不斷自後方增加，且在此大軍的後方，保有圓滑的輸送組織，以此問題，甚爲嚴，對紅軍抗戰不容稍加輕視，據德軍公佈之數字，合計自去年十一月二十日至本年一月二十四日，冬季戰中，德軍擊破紅軍戰車數達六千二百九十一輛之鉅。但紅軍喪失此鉅數戰車後，其攻勢依然極爲猛烈。因此事實，德軍參謀本部在對蘇戰爭的進行上，不能不根本的變史其最高作戰方針。二十三日之德國阿開瑪奈報稱爲：一成吉思汗以來，亞洲最大之嵐」。二十四日之海爾基夏·倍奧派哈太報用大字標題：「蘇聯豈能勝利乎？一將東方的危機，傳達於國民，新聞界之痛切表示，殊堪注意。</p>

<h3>強有力的東條內閣（三）</h3>
<p>谷情報局總裁與森山法制局長官</p>
<p>森山法制局長官，出生於桑名市八幡町，卒業於第八高等師範，繼入東京大學專攻法科。受有純粹的法制局的敎育，精通憲法，曾任行政科試騐委員。待人接物，和藹可親，性情率真。以言柔和則較勝於谷情報局總裁而不及谷總裁那樣矜持，森山的為人重視，即在於他的人品。因此，對樞府關係的折衝上，爲現內閣所不可或缺的人物，東條首由深資倚畀。局處於法制局中，沒有政治的野心，即為其率直性的經政治的磨練，實可成爲第一流的政治家，下屬及一般人對他頗多好評。東條內閣對樞府的　係得以圓滑進行者，可以說是他的功績。</p>
<p>谷情報局總裁就任外相，許多方面以爲他不很合適，設置大東亞省問願在擱置　時，外相暫由東條首相兼攝，對於繼任者各方面異常注意谷的起因，使東條內閣的同志內閣色彩更　濃化。谷嘗任外務省亞細亞局長，當時，聯合情報部長白鳥敏夫及青年軍人，推進强硬外交，當時的外務省，以此為人所稱頌。其後與陳鳥分離，轉任駐法大使，拒絕法政府的逾格厚待，而度過了不幸運的日子。又當阿部內閣預備設置貿易省時·谷時爲外務次官，與外相野村同表反對，外務省自局長以下全體高等官齊上辭呈，而外務省的中堅及靑年份子亦均表同情。不久，否極泰來，經東條拔擢爲內閣的情報局總裁，而爲內閣四長官之一，至其所以能任外務大臣者，或許是他過去的好評所致。</p>
<p>谷自任外務大臣後，即以其自身的經過爲藍本，而起用松本次官等新幹部。外務省自拔擢松本次官，上村政務局長等後，氣象一新。此等新銳，決意爲谷效協贊之勞，因此，現在的谷，大爲成功，而成爲大人物之一。然仍虛懷若谷，常抱如履薄冰的態度，不以目前的正竟為滿足。戰時下負國家重任的四長官的地位，旣縷述如上，則四長官的得人與吾，實為國家前途之所　。現在，所有的內閣幕僚，均為東條首相的勢力所能及，上下一心，樹立眞正的戰時姿態，自不待言，而四長官亦應融合如一，持嚴肅態度，以副國家的重託。</p>
<p>臥薪嘗膽共體時艱</p>
<p>確保大東亞戰爭勝利的前途，正多荊棘。一般國民，莫不深知此教意義的重大與困難，因此，亦愈堅其戰勝的決意。</p>
<p>最近，所取振奮國民的諸方策，都不是萬全之策。情報局的首腦部，他們自身都嚴肅地做人，爲更倔强地團結國家的內部而努力。</p>
<p>在陣前指揮，固應如是，在經濟界亦何能例外。藤山日商會首長說的「誘導人民的方策，重機巧而不尙直言，這果能說是最好的有效果的方法嗎？」這種率直的言論，實在很有理由。當然，這決不是指摘政府政策的不對，政府的大聲疾呼，以喚醒人民，同樣，經濟界現在亦不能不深自反省，政府的施政，從何處着手，不是曰前成爲問題的大事嗎？精神總動員者，使人民在其自身職位上，不問成敗盡力進行，此在經濟部門力面，不應該妥善計劃生產擴充的根本方針，傾其全力，斷然實行嗎？最近，在此次戰爭，廢止企業利潤的言論，反在民間却時有所聞。在這空前的時局中，會社經理令，賃金統制令等，統制經濟的措置，仍未放棄追求利潤的舊概念，而阻止了生產的擴充，假使這不是出於政府的本意，則現在正是政府首腦部採取斷然處置最好的時機。爲人東亞戰爭的必勝，應廢棄利潤的概念，使全部國民都以被微用者的精神，共渡難關。現在正是建立及時方策的良機。應該有率直的具體的表示。促使國民覺悟時局的重大性。假使有人因前途的困難而失墜了勇氣，假使有人以此爲批判政局的工具，此時而有此等人，則政府首腦部不能不講求徹底的消滅非國民的方策。敵人英國會有征服日本後駐兵於六大都市的論調，我們即使未曾知道這論調，亦不難想像日本萬一在此戰中戰敗後的景象。絕對不能後退一步，而且即明知前途的困雞，亦不能不在此苦難的道上邁進。臥薪嘗膽這一言辭，迄今未見在新聞紙上出現，寗非怪事。</p>
<p>現在正是傾全國的力量，以博取勝利的時候，於此，我們對目前的中心勢力內閣四長官期望甚殷，故文中如有失言之處，尙請如文中所述的氣度。予以寬容。（完）</p>

<h3>日蝕是怎樣發生的？</h3>
<p>日蝕是怎樣發生的呢？地球繞行於太陽周圍，月則繞行於地球周圍。又太陽亦常以驚人的速度不絕運動着。在這正齊的運動的途中，太陽和地球及月，三者並列在一直綫上時，即發生「蝕」的現象。這時如月挾在地球和太陽之間，便成日蝕，若地球挾於太陽和月之間，遮住由太陽照來的光，使沒有太陽光反射於月上，便成月蝕。日蝕的現象，換句話說，即是太陽投月影於地球上之謂。立於其影之中而望太陽時，月與太陽相重之狀，就是日全蝕。然而月雖挾於地球和太陽當中，而自地球上所見之太陽，形狀比月爲大時，則不起日全蝕，而成爲環蝕。即這時在黑暗之月的周圍，可見金色燦爛的太陽環，光景頗爲美麗。不過環蝕和偏蝕同樣，從天文學者的立塲來說，不成爲什麽大問題的。</p>
<p>又普通日蝕，決不是珍奇的現象，雖一年中其能發生的時期有限，而通常則稱之爲日蝕季節。大概每隔一百七十三日，地球上總有地方，可見日蝕，即地球上一年必有二次，間或三次的日蝕可見。計算起來，日本在這次遇到日蝕之後，將在紀元二千六百二十三年（譯者註：今年爲日本紀元二千六百零三年）七月二十一日冉於北海道東部，二千六百四十一年七月三十一日於庫頁島中部，二千六百四十八年三月十八日於小笠原羣島東部海上，二千六百六十九年七月二十二日於琉球方面，有日全蝕出現，然而均爲海上及其他塲所時間等所妨，殆無觀測的價値，結局非至二千六百九十五年九月二日到能登半島及關東地方來訪的黑太陽出現！在日本本土觀測，斷不致有。</p>
<p>即在本年二月五日的全蝕後九十二年之間，日本不再有日蝕出現，故現代的日本人，看了這次日蝕之後，一生難得再見了，這就是這次日蝕所以重要的理由，更有把現在日本科學的貴重資料這留給下代科學的意味。又雖同樣是日全蝕，而投於地球上的月影，却有時大有時小，這是由於太陽和月及地球三者的距離隨時不同所致。日蝕時太陽投於地球上的月影，因地球自轉之故，成爲帶狀，奔馳於地球的表面，故在地球上日蝕圈內某地點所能見的日全蝕時間很爲短促，但影大則時間亦較長。時間短促，觀測當然不易。二月五日的日全蝕時間爲「一分五十三秒」，這比諸上次昭和十一年（民國二十五年）六月十九日見於北海道的日全蝕時間，僅短數秒鐘，足供充分研究之需。不過這一分五十三秒，實是學者在研究上千余難買的寳貴時間，故屆時熱鬧忙碌的觀測，將使日本五十餘位與天文有關之學者，絞盡腦汁，而向「黑太陽」挑戰。（丁：譯自一月二十日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>日蝕圖的說明</h3>
<p>圖示二月五日的日蝕，出現於日本全土，滿洲國，中國東部，非律賓，西伯利亞東部，阿拉斯加東部，以及美國的西海岸。其中可以看見日全蝕之處，限於圖的中央以三綫所表之幅的一百八十公里的帶內，此綫如圖所示，自滿洲國東部起，通過日本北海道中部，至阿拉斯加上陸。圖中左端的綫（滿洲國，中國本土表示日出與蝕終，第二綫（北海道）表示日出後始蝕，右端之綫以東，即爲美國大陸，於日沒之後始蝕，自右起之第二綫表示，蝕終而日沒。總之，北海道爲日全蝕地帶，適在境界綫通過之地點，日出後（即上午七時五十分）日蝕開始。</p>

<h3>引導遊資以促進　華商工廠生產論</h3>
<p>— 李權時</p>
<p>據上海經濟年鑑所載，上海社會現存有的遊資，達八十億元之譜。這龐大遊資，過去以外滙，烚赤，紗布，外股，食糧及地產爲其活動塲所。自當局勵行取締投機以後，遊資的活動範圍日狹，這巨大的財力，若不設法使之流入生產事業的正軌，則隨時隨地找尋其蠢動的對象，破壞上海經濟的安定。因爲近數年來，由於環境的特殊，國際政治經濟的變幻靡常，擁有資金者莫不以從事投機刦取暴利爲得計，更因幣制的不定，物價的高翔，存款利息的收入，不足以抵補幣値下降的損失；於是銀行的定期存款激劇减少，即略有活期存款，也是臨時寄存性質，隨時準備作投機之用，所以也變成遊資之一種，在投機市塲中推波助瀾。</p>
<p>目前當局在消極方面旣厲行取締投機，在積極方面，似又應引導遊資入於生產途徑，把投機變爲投資，以增加物資的供應。但是在擁有遊資者依據數年來利得的經騐看來，資金的運用如無下列三條件，殊難引起其興趣：（一）爲巨大的吸收力，（二）爲高度的可變性，（三）爲優厚的利益，目前上海市塲能具有消納遊資的條件者，只有華股市塲。所以在當局取締投機以後，遊資流入華股市塲，是必然的趨勢。在集中和强化各生產部門的工作，以適應戰時經濟體制的前提之下，遊資流入華股市塲，化貽害社會的性質爲增强生產的資金，無論就國家財政經濟政策和國民生活立塲講，都是値得欣幸的事。</p>
<p>可是數年來物價高翔，投機猖獗的結果，一般人對於市塲活動多少抱着草木皆兵的心理，所以遊資流入華股市塲刺激華股市價普遍的上漲，以後由於投資與投機的認識不淸，又引起過慮的不安，遂致統制華股限價取締的傳說，又甚囂塵上。我們知道取締投機，根絕黑市，是當局維護戰時金融，保障民衆生活的一貫政策，凡在國民，應常竭誠擁護，所以遊資流入華股市塲，化投機爲投資，就工商界的立塲言，也是朝夕企求的事。如果因華股市價的高漲而認爲有投機的嫌疑，那末因噎廢食，似非貫澈戰時經濟政策維護生產保障民生之道。</p>
<p>遊資之應導入生產途徑，爲當局及社會所殷切希望的事，且爲執行戰時經濟政策過程中的一個重要項目。原則上當無問題。目前所應討論者，是遊資轉變爲生產資金的方法問題，即留存於社會上的兩大遊資，如何方可納入於生產途徑？我們要知道上海遊資雖有八十億元之多，但均爲散漫的資金，沒有相當的組織，只要看遊資的東竄西遊，一會兒涉足於外匯，一會兒染指於紗布，統制管理，只有促成遊資由這一投機市塲流入那一投機市塲，並不能澈底的把他防堵而爲有利於國家的運用。故引導遊資投向生產事業，建造資本市塲，提倡華股交易，似乎不失爲簡捷而有效的辦法。且建立華商產業證券的交易塲所，在戰前已有人公開倡導，數年來試行的結果，成績似乎尙屬可觀，况華股又適合於上述穩當投資的三個條件。華股賣買的旺盛，使貧薄的我國生產界，可以在公開市場獲得必要的資金，直接增加產業界的生產力，間接即增加戰時需用的物資。故華股交易的蓬勃，誠爲非常時期利多弊少的現象，即不加以提倡，亦何忍加以限制。</p>
<p>有人說，目前華股的賣買，實是投機而不是投資，果如所云，那末創辦生產事業，也可視爲投機而非投資。考華股的本質是一種投資證券，非投機的籌碼可比。目前華股的漲價，乃華股所代表的物資漲價所必有的反映，工廠的資產漲價，則以物資作背景的華股價値增高，亦爲必然的趨勢。故欲華股之不漲價，必須先求一般貨物之不漲價。而股息之不變，並不影響股價之不變也。此種現象，不僅我國爲然，世界各國戰時都有這種經騐。如國際經濟週報載一九四二年日本股票界的情形如左表：</p>
<p>近年來日本股價昂騰情形，爲歷來所未有，雖一再提高保證準備金，而搜求者仍不稍懈。股票增値爲產業工具漲價的反映，產業發達爲物資增加的要素，物資增加則可顯示國力的充實，爲戰事勝利的前提，在東亞民族企求解放的時代，力謀產業的發展，實爲切要的工作，則促使生產資金流動化之股票交易，又豈能加以限制。</p>
<p>或以爲股票市價的上漲，足以刺激物價的上漲，這是倒果爲因的說法，因爲股票所代表的是物資，物資漲價乃使股票漲價，並非股票漲價，刺激物資漲價，此點我們應該認淸，方不致認投資爲投機。如果對於華股的交易加以種種限制，則流弊所及，足以迫使社會上龐大的遊資逃避，或流回於囤貨及投機的途徑，爲淵驅魚，爲叢驅爵，更非厲行戰時經濟政策穩定民生的辦法，而華商工廠的資金缺乏，生產减少，工人失業，這究竟是安定社會還是擾亂社會！建立戰時經濟，還是損害戰時經濟？這是不待討論即可決定是非的問題。且此八十億元的遊資，流入於華股市塲者究有百分之幾，尙無統計。在這產業資金左支右絀的時代，使遊資盡納入於生產事業，亦不患其多。我們只要看日本近五年股份資金演進的趨勢，就可知道戰時生產資金擴充的必要！</p>
<p>上海產業界共有的資金，當然不能和日本相比，但八十億元若全數投入華股市塲，以與日本產業資金相比，仍如小巫之見大巫。在此東亞民族和英美互爭生存的時代，我們應負起一部分的責任，發展生產事業，充實戰時物資，使我們在太平洋戰事中獲致最後勝利。則放任華股的公開賣買，使產業界獲得必需的資金，以增强生產力量，似不失爲賢明的措施。設有少數企業家或有藉故抬高股票市價，不自整頓事業內容，則我們自也應羣起責難，予以輿論的制裁耳。</p>

<h3>中國之友輸款助學　——葦津珍彥氏之義舉</h3>
<p>本報讀者助學金，歷屆承各界輸助，尤以本屆最爲然烈。足證此舉之積極意義，已爲社會人士極端贊同。昨日更有中國之友蔁津珍彥先生，遠自東京滙款一萬餘元，託朝日新聞上海支局轉送本報，原函主旨謂旨謂：「中國之靑年學童，爲求來之主人翁，何忍坐令失學，日本休戚相關，睹此現狀，咸表關心。」而蔁津氏之尊翁，昔日亦爲最同情中國貧民之眞正中國人民之友。此種誠摯熱情，其主要動機，常爲關心中國未來主人翁，而勿坐使失學，表示日本休戚與共之同情心，本報於領謝之餘，尤鄭重吿中國靑年諸君，友邦人士之捐款助學金者，當推葦津先生爲第一人，更希望富於熱情之友邦人士，繼起響應，而不讓蔁津氏之專美。同時，期望靑年學童得到助學諸君，虛心接受未來中國主人翁之榮譽，發奮力學，懸此自期，以副友邦輸助者熱烈之喁望。至於朝日新聞上海支局長木村亮次郞及平尾土茶兩先生將本報讀者助學運動，向日本國內鼓吹，發生影響，至爲感謝。而平尾先生尤於前次本報召集冬賑座談會時，發衣喚起友邦僑民同情之意見，善意協助，更爲敬佩。</p>

<h3>過着廢歷新年的人羣</h3>
<p>— 徐玉璋</p>
<p>一九四二年悠悠的歲月，巳似輕烟般地掠過了。　橫在目前的情景，却明明又是一個「年頭」降臨，而是一個簇新的「元旦」，一切表現着所謂「新年」的氣象；重復充滿在街頭上，娛樂塲中，吃食店裏。</p>
<p>這幾天，是靑年人最活躍的日子，尤其在這個繁華的都市裏，不論戲院，舞塲，點心店，以及萬惡淵藪的賭窟中，處處有着年靑人在那兒擠軋，也有平日過着嚴肅生活的學生，店夥們，會帶着父母或老闆給他們的汗血錢到那兒賭博。但他們都忘記了多難的國家，正期望着他們今後須具有磨勵以須，刻苦猛進的精神去應付常前的危機。</p>
<p>百金一匣的捲烟，十金一隻的柑子，會被無數的高等華人搬銷一空，或作無謂的消間，或獻媚於顯貴，至春宴一席非千金而不辦，壓歲錢一封非百金而不給者，亦比比皆是，其豪華奢侈之習慣，竟忘却了廣大的同胞，正浸陷在水深火熱之中。</p>
<p>還有成羣的所謂「隱貧」者，沒有發財的機會，沒有暇閑的日子，天天肩着他們高度生活的擔子，在飢餓綫上作最後的掙扎，他們不知「新年」是可樂，不知一切享樂爲何事，祇知刻苦猛進，求取光明的途徑。（移酬助學）</p>
<h3>除夕雜感</h3>
<p>— 茹靈</p>
<p>今年除象夕，不比往年，銀根吃緊，試問百家之中，能有幾戶可圖　飽？臘鼓催催聲中，第一使我猛然想起的是索舊帳。商塲以端五，中秋，除夕爲三節，按節索欠，稱爲三節帳，除一節，通宵　旦，雖東方旣白，尙絡繹道途，一般窮朋友，逼得沒辦法·笨一　的尋死，聰明一點的避債。再不然，家中還有幾件破衲襖，拿來往長生庫裏典質，挨餓耐寒過此殘年。蔡鐵翁詩云：『無地堪容避債台，一年積欠一宵催，店門關到質錢庫，還點燈籠走一回』。所謂『王小二過年，一年不如一年」。窮朋友眼見某公館吃知味館一千元錢的靑魚乾，買某公司七百元錢的大菜盤，而猶滿不在乎，真堪同聲一哭。黃星周印寅除夕詩：『第一過年窮快活，從來未有索逋人』。此時此地，窮小子而未跟索逋人的，能有幾人！</p>
<p>古人描寫除夕詩句，大抵寫興奮之情者少，抒牢騷之意者多。白居易的『病眼少眠非守歲，老心多感又臨春』，宋曾棨的『臘酒漸　鄉思苦，夜燈相對客愁孤』，或是客地思家，或是窮愁老病。至於那位認爲『百無一用是書生』的常州詩人黃仲　呢？却在『癸已除夕偶然二首』之一裏大發牢騷，說：『年年此夕費吟呻，兒女燈前竊笑頻；汝輩何知吾自悔，枉拋心力作詩人』，雖是筆端感慨，讀來却一往情深。嗚呼　書生筆底下的除夕，何其悲痛耶？</p>
<p>冬盡春回，去舊更新，窮小子過年，且一學鄭板橋的二句：『瓶中白水供先祀，窗外梅花當早餐』。</p>
<h3>徵文錄取第四名　我今年約計劃</h3>
<p>— 黃維</p>
<p>我是一個小學校裏的敎員，我的職務是在敎育小學生，我今年約計劃便是在如何敎育這一班小學生。</p>
<p>筆者身爲女子，在一個鄉鎭裏當着小學敎師；不敢以目前有心人自居，更不敢以復興敎育爲已任。執敎以來，瞬已三載；年來小學敎師生活的淸苦，是人所週知的事實；然而終於給留住了。無他，只是爲了小朋友。「救救我們的孩子！」我自己親自敎撫過三年的孩子，我豈肯輕易地離棄？</p>
<p>日子本是在迂緩地爬，祇有我的孩子們才能使我覺得它在飛。一年過去了，又一年過去了，逝去的是光陰，留下的是陳跡。深夜自思：惟有心死最可哀，也惟有麻木的最沒救藥。爲了孩子們，爲了孩子們的將來，我又安可不龜勉惕勵呢？以下便是我今年的新計劃：</p>
<p>我想我今年第一件事要做的——也就是我計劃的第一部——便是加緊小朋友們的體育訓練。你看，他們雖都是十一二歲的孩子，但穿上了大掛，却老成得像個大人。天沒什麽冷，便把棉袍加上了；這種情形，比起東西洋各國的小學生來，眞是太相形見拙了。</p>
<p>中國一般兒童體格之弱，我們是見慣了的，關於這個謎，有人說，中國人種太弱了！數千年傳下來的暮氣，大有積重難返之勢。誠然如此，我們今日對於孩子們的體育訓練，其責任是如何的艱鉅！</p>
<p>復次，關於孩子們的智育，我主張本年應該特別加以革新的，就是少讀死書，多接觸和認識大自然。說也奇怪，我的小學校所在地雖是一個農村社會小都市，但因爲鄰近上海的緣故，却已飽中近代都市文明的毒素。小朋友中，不認五榖的，竟居絕大多數。我以爲這是需要積極改善的。致此之道：讀一本植物學，不如令他們到鄉下去學種一次田：描一幅地圖，不如到遠處去旅行。在可能範圍內，兒童的智育訓練，應儘量把死的換成活的，把呆板而枯燥的書本易爲活潑而有趣的知識和經騐，這是我的建議。</p>
<p>課室裏的噪音，永遠像夏夜蚊虫的嗡嗡，不會有個停息。孩子們是可愛的，但却又那樣的頑皮。就那課室私相談話一事而論，處理也就够棘手的啦。你不能拉長着臉，厲聲叫他們屛息以聽——這樣就會使孩子們怕你，甚至恨。你想孩子們怕你恨你，你還能叫他們聽你話嗎？不聽你話，你又敎什麼呢？然而，你又不能儘讓他們鬧，儘讓他們鬧，你又敎什麽呢？是的，敎孩子們是件難事，而要加緊我今年對他們意識，體育和智育三方面的訓練，尤其是談何容易！雖然，我們爲要求將來結果的美滿，必須不辭今日播種的辛勤！（按黃女士海寗人，北京師範大學畢業，現任硤石小學敎員）</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>（一）（二）</p>
<p>「一個好傢伙，里佛爾斯，』吉普斯在將這故事對威葛特夫人講到第十二遍的時候，總要這樣說。「在一班裏—呃哼—並不是很出色的孩子。我記得他永遠弄不懂—呃哼—動詞。而現在—呃哼—我在報上看見，他們已經使他作—呃哼—一個從男爵了。這正是了不得—呃哼—這正是了不得。」</p>
<p>一九〇八年的那一個早上，約翰爵士和吉普斯聯臂繞了荒廢的板球塲走着，曾這樣說：『吉普斯，老孩子，我聽說你和拉爾斯頓發生着爭論。爲了你的緣故，我聽到了這消息很難過—不過我要你知道，校董們都是和你一致的。我們很不歡喜那個傢伙。很精明，很能幹，可是有一些太精明，如果你問我。藉着在股票交易所的活動，據說已將學校的基金增加了一倍。可以說他已經這樣辦到，但是像他這樣的一個小子，却需要提防着。因此，如果他還要對你玩玩他的手段，你可以很客氣地對他說，他儘可以滾開。校董們不要你辭職。勃洛克菲爾德沒有了你就要走樣，這是他們知道的。我們也都知道這個。只要你覺得高興，你可留在這裏到一百歲—的確，我們的希望就是你會留亦這裏。』</p>
<p>不論當時和以後，吉普斯回憶到這裏，就說不下去了。</p>
<p>（一二）</p>
<p>他就這樣留在勃洛克菲爾傯，竭力少和拉爾斯頓發生接觸。一九一一年，拉爾斯頓離職，『去改進他自己了』；他受任爲一個較大的公立學校的校長。在這裏繼他的任的是一個名叫査特里斯（Ohatteris）的人，吉普斯是喜歡他的；他甚至比了拉爾頓那時還要年輕—三十四歲。大家却說他很有聲名，不論怎樣，他是現代化的（博物學的榮譽畢業生），和善的，有同情的。他在吉普斯身上認出了勃洛克菲爾德的慣例，他就客氣地，聰明地，承受了這種情形，不以爲忤。（三〇）</p>

<h3>The International Situation During the Preparation Period for the Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>The international situation has recently presented a complex and intricate state of affairs. The new situation indicates that a larger-scale war with considerable decisive significance is being actively prepared by the belligerent countries.</p>
<p>In Europe, with the arrival of General Winter, the Soviet Union has launched a near "all-out" counter-offensive. Germany is carrying out a planned retreat, and the plan to encircle Moscow from Stalingrad has been temporarily abandoned. At the same time, it is also withdrawing from the North Caucasus, actively preparing for a new spring offensive this year. Similarly, the Axis powers have also carried out a planned retreat in Africa. The Libyan region has temporarily absorbed British troops, while concentrating Axis forces in Tunisia in preparation for a decisive war. Summarizing the new situation on the European and African battlefields, it can be seen that, on the surface, the anti-Axis forces have shifted from the defensive to the offensive. In reality, due to the astonishingly smooth completion of the Axis forces' retreat plans on the Eastern Front and in North Africa, with minimal losses, they can still firmly grasp the initiative for future wars. Therefore, whether in the Mediterranean or in any part of Europe, once a new war breaks out, the Axis forces will certainly be fully prepared.</p>
<p>The anti-Axis forces have temporarily shifted from the defensive to the offensive, but this offensive is, strictly speaking, quite fragile. The fundamental reason for this fragility is the contradiction between capitalist imperialism and socialism, which is an irreconcilable contradiction. Therefore, Britain and the United States have not only been slow to launch a "second front" but also very slow and limited in providing support in terms of military supplies and materials. The second reason for the fragility of the anti-Axis offensive is the contradiction between Britain and the United States and the contradiction between British and American imperialism and the colonial national movements. These contradictions cannot be resolved simply because of a "common enemy"; they are continuing to develop. An example of the former is the conflict in North Africa between Giraud, who has British backing, and De Gaulle, who has American backing. An example of the latter is the stalemate in the Indian problem and the hypocrisy of British and American aid to Chongqing. (For example, the actual performance of the U.S. Lend-Lease Act in 1942, with loans to Chongqing accounting for only 3% of the total, which even American newspapers referred to as "too pitiful.") These contradictions have created the fragility of the so-called offensive of the anti-Axis forces. Therefore, in the consideration of the undecided battle, there is an urgent need for remedy. Thus, the Casablanca Conference was staged. The theme of the conference was naturally dominated by strategy: first, the so-called Anglo-American-Soviet-Chongqing military conference issue; and second, the issue of future combat directions and strategies. The next most important was political strategy: first, to bring together De Gaulle and Giraud to promote the unity of the French anti-Axis forces; and second, to entice neutral countries. Churchill has now gone to Turkey to lobby. Such is the content of the Casablanca Conference, and such is the so-called decisive battle posture of the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<p>Targeting this new situation, the Axis powers' actions on the Eastern Front and in North Africa represented the first step in a strategic decision to strike nearby. In the future battlefields, regardless of whether it is the Mediterranean air-sea battle centered on Tunisia, or the continental war centered on Southeastern Europe, or even if it is still coastal warfare in Europe, the Axis powers' preparations are quite strict and they are waiting for it. We can prove how strong the Axis authorities' determination to meet the challenge and their confidence in final victory are from the German leader's speech commemorating the tenth anniversary of Nazi rule and from Mussolini's roar as reported in yesterday's newspapers. What cannot be ignored here is Japan's movements in the Greater East Asia War. For example, the concentration of Japan's national power, the Nanjing National Government's declaration of war, and the improvement of politics in the southern occupied areas are all heading towards the road to victory in the preparation for a decisive battle. On the 2nd of this month, a Domei News Agency dispatch stated that Prime Minister Tojo, in his speech on operational goals, indicated: "The Japanese Empire is determined to use various methods to defeat the enemy's combat power, but does not intend to dominate the world. The true intention of Japan is to establish coexistence and co-prosperity among all countries." Prime Minister Tojo pointed out: "In the year since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has become a 'have' nation, with resources exceeding those of Britain and the United States, and its combat power has also rapidly increased. Conversely, Britain and the United States are struggling under the heavy burden of increasing difficulties. In terms of materials, Japan has occupied the vast resources of the southern region, laying the foundation for certain victory. Furthermore, the countries of East Asia have awakened and are closely cooperating with us..." Amidst the so-called offensive preparations of the anti-Axis forces, Japan, with an extraordinary attitude, first launched an attack on Britain and the United States. For example, the Japanese air force's attack on American positions on January 29, which was praised by the German press, was, as stated by Hori, spokesman for the Tokyo Information Bureau: "The decisive victory won by the Imperial Navy Air Force in the battle off Rennell Island is Japan's first strong response to Britain and the United States' boasting about a major offensive in 1943 at the Casablanca Conference. It has shattered the extravagant hopes of the Anglo-American camp and once again proved that the enemy's attempt to break into the vast area controlled by Japan is futile." (Tokyo, 2nd, Domei News Agency dispatch) In fact, the anti-Axis countries are mostly filled with fearful psychology regarding the situation in East Asia. For example, British military commentator Falls wrote an article published in the "London Illustrated News" saying that the hope of the Allied forces recovering the areas occupied by Japan is very slim. He also said: "Australia and the United States have no victory in New Guinea." The Times also stated that "Although the Allies are working very hard, there is no progress in the Pacific military." Australian Prime Minister Curtin has repeatedly called on the United States to pay attention to the serious situation of the war in the Pacific and provide assistance. Chongqing is even more extremely worried about Britain and the United States' neglect of the Pacific war situation. A United Press Chongqing dispatch revealed that "Unless the United States' supplies are transported conveniently and other necessities are transported overland through Burma, the Chinese army will not launch an attack." This pessimistic sentiment about the Pacific war situation is filled among the anti-Axis countries, which can further prove Japan's stable position in the Greater East Asia War and the future decisive battle.</p>
<p>Judging from the current international situation and from the shape of the preparation of a decisive battle between the belligerent countries, we cannot but point out that an unprecedented era in history is fast approaching us, and our future victory is very obvious. However, the dangers of our future journey, the fierceness of the battle, and all unexpected hardships must also be noted and guarded against in this decisive battle between countries, and we must quickly prepare. We want to know? The day when the fate of East Asian nations is decided by themselves is coming soon, but everything depends on the price we pay - how we fight will determine it. We want to ask all East Asian nations to cheer up, unite, prepare for the final battle, and welcome the final victory.</p>

<h3>Japanese House of Peers Passes Amended Military Service Law and Other Bills; Minister of Finance Attends House of Representatives Budget Meeting; Reports on Post-War Public Bond Issuance Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd, Domei News Agency Dispatch: The House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:00 this morning and unanimously voted to pass the seven bills submitted by the government to amend the Military Service Law, etc., without any amendments. The bills were immediately submitted to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives did not hold a plenary session today. However, the general budget committee met at 10:13 AM to listen to explanations from the Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry, Commerce, and Finance regarding the taxation of consolidated associations and other issues. The meeting adjourned at noon. The meeting resumed in the afternoon to discuss rural improvement issues and adjourned at 5:35 PM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd, Central News Agency Dispatch: At the 81st session of the Japanese Diet today, the House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:10 AM. First, Chairman Matsudaira reported that he had cabled the Supreme Commander of the Japanese forces in the South, expressing his congratulations on the great results achieved in the naval battle off Rennell Island. Then, State Minister Ie made a policy speech and answered questions.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd, Central News Agency Dispatch: In order to simplify production administration and unify guidance and supervision, with a view to greatly increasing the production of important wartime military supplies, the Japanese government has submitted a Wartime Administrative Special Exceptions Bill to the Diet. The bill was passed by the House of Peers today and will be submitted to the House of Representatives tomorrow. According to the previous announcement, the Wartime Administrative Authority Special Exceptions Bill is intended to strengthen the Prime Minister's authority in production administration.</p>
<p>Therefore, the operation of the bill after its enactment and implementation is highly valued by all parties. From the government's explanation of the proposal in the House of Peers and the explanation in the House of Representatives' general budget meeting, the fundamental policy of the bill's operation is that the Prime Minister may exercise the directive authority stipulated in the bill without establishing a separate special committee. On the one hand, the Prime Minister will consult with the cabinet ministers, and on the other hand, the opinions of influential people will be adopted as cooperation, and the Prime Minister will be fully responsible for promoting production administration.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd, Domei News Agency Dispatch: The Minister of Finance stated at the House of Representatives budget meeting today that the total amount of national debt issued by Japan from the outbreak of the China Incident on July 7, 1937, to the end of last year was 39,682,000,000 yen. Of this amount, 87.3%, or 34,646,000,000 yen, has been absorbed by the public, which shows that the Japanese people trust the government. The percentage of those who directly purchased the national debt last year reached 96.2%, which is the highest record in the past six years.</p>
<h3>Japan Negotiates with Various Enemy Countries; Sends Ships to Exchange Nationals; Protests to Neutral Countries Regarding Japanese Nationals Abused in Enemy Countries</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki stated in the House of Peers this morning that the Japanese government is currently conducting concrete negotiations with enemy governments in order to send ships to exchange nationals and bring back Japanese nationals who are still detained in enemy countries. In response to a question from a member, the Foreign Minister stated that the Japanese government is carefully paying attention to the welfare of Japanese nationals detained in enemy countries and countries with which diplomatic relations have been severed. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japanese nationals in the United States and the Dutch East Indies were immediately arrested. More than 120,000 Japanese nationals along the Pacific coast of Canada and the United States have been forced to withdraw to the interior, living miserably. This is an inhumane act by the enemy countries that violates international law. Under these circumstances, the Japanese government has entrusted Switzerland and other countries that represent the interests of Japanese nationals in enemy countries to lodge strong protests with the enemy governments to improve the treatment of detained Japanese nationals. On the other hand, the Japanese government has given fair treatment to enemy nationals, as evidenced by the report of the representative of the International Red Cross after inspecting the detention camps.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Japanese spokesperson Hori refuted rumors of ill-treatment of the Chilean Minister to Japan, stating, "Regarding the true treatment of the Chilean Minister to Japan, the Chilean government has received false reports. The Chilean Minister is now residing in Tokyo and is being treated with great leniency by the Japanese side. When asked what the basis was for Chile's misunderstanding that its Minister to Japan was being ill-treated, the spokesperson replied that he did not know. It is regrettable that the Chilean government has taken steps before it has accurately understood the facts. The interests of Chile in Japan are being taken care of by the Swiss government, while the interests of Japan in Chile are being taken care of by the representative of the Swedish government."</p>
<h3>German Rearguard Units Withdraw According to Plan; Although Soviet Forces Have Recaptured Stalingrad, the Price Paid is Truly Astonishing</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: German forces are using flexible tactics to great effect in the area west and southwest of Voronezh. The Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive in the middle reaches of the Don River, but encountered strong resistance from the German forces and made no progress. They then dispatched fresh troops to continue the fierce attack, attempting to encircle the industrial area in the center from the right wing. The German side is strictly guarding against this plan. The situation is unchanged in the lower reaches of the Don River east of the Don River and along the Manich Line. The German forces between the Don River and the Caucasus are continuing to withdraw the rearguard units according to the established plan and are launching counterattacks from time to time, repeatedly inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. A part of the German forces in the western Caucasus has also begun to withdraw for strategic reasons. The enemy forces are following up and advancing, but have been repulsed southwest of Krasnodar and southeast of Novorossiysk. British reports that the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive in the Kerch area are not true. There were only local small battles in that area, and only two companies of Soviet troops participated.</p>
<h3>German Troops in Stalingrad: Unprecedented Heroism</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: The German troops besieged in northern Stalingrad sent their last wireless report yesterday afternoon, saying only "Long live Germany, long live Hitler." After that, the telecommunications traffic there was completely cut off from the outside world. The ten-week resistance has come to an end. It is recalled that at the end of November last year, Soviet propaganda claimed that the German troops in Stalingrad had completely surrendered. By mid-January of this year, the Soviet side had to admit that the German troops were still fighting with great spirit. Now, although the Soviet army has recaptured Stalingrad, the price it has paid is also extremely astonishing. It is estimated that no less than 300,000 Soviet soldiers were buried in the city, and no less than 1,000 tanks were sacrificed. The German Sixth Army resisted an enemy several times its size for so long under the situation that external supplies were completely cut off. In the history of war, its heroism cannot be said to be unprecedented.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Official sources here announced last night that although the Axis forces on the Eastern Front repelled the Soviet army's repeated attacks in various places, the German Eleventh Army, which was holding its last position in the northern part of Stalingrad, sent its last report last night. It was learned that the army had heroically resisted the continuous attacks of the Soviet army for several weeks, but was ultimately outnumbered and its line of defense was broken on the first day of this month. By that night, it had run out of ammunition and food, and the entire line of defense had collapsed.</p>
<h3>North China Authorities Actively Promote the Agricultural Production Increase Plan; Designate Model Counties in Hebei and Other Provinces; Compulsory Implementation of Various Improvement Plans</h3>
<p>Beijing, 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch: In order to ensure self-sufficiency in food, the North China authorities are now actively promoting the agricultural production increase countermeasures for this year and have specially designated model counties for agricultural production increase, including 75 counties in Hebei Province, 52 counties in Shandong Province, 35 counties in Shanxi Province, and 20 counties in the Subei-Huai area. The key points of the measures are to set up model production increase farms in the model counties, establish production increase mutual promotion associations, compulsorily implement well-drilling plans, improve fertilization, use ammonium sulfate fertilizer, and implement seed disinfection. The main agricultural crops to be increased are wheat, rice, cotton, chestnuts, corn, and sweet potatoes. At the same time, the production of miscellaneous grains will be increased to ensure rural food supply.</p>
<h3>South China Economic Conference Scheduled to be Held</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 3rd, Zhonglai News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese authorities here announced on the 2nd that relevant Chinese agencies will also participate in the Second South China Economic Liaison Conference. The conference has been scheduled to be held continuously at the Guangzhou Japanese Consulate General from February 19 for four days. It has been decided to invite relevant officials from Nanjing and Qingdao to participate in this conference.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Chiang Kai-shek is in Washington, D.C.; Consulting with Various American Leaders; Demanding More Assistance</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 3rd, Domei News Agency Dispatch: This place yesterday received unverified news that Chiang Kai-shek is now in Washington. According to an Australian radio broadcast, Chiang is currently in Washington consulting with various leaders of the American government on the issue of the United States providing more Lend-Lease assistance, because American aid to Chongqing has not reached even 20% of what Washington had promised. Therefore, Chiang has made this trip to Washington. News from Chongqing also widely spread that Chiang is now in Washington, but it has not been confirmed by reliable sources. According to news from Chongqing, during Chiang's absence, He Yingqin is temporarily acting as Chairman of the Supreme National Defense Council, Kong Xiangxi is temporarily acting as President of the Executive Yuan, Chen Guofu is temporarily acting as Director-General of the Kuomintang, and He Yaozu is temporarily acting as Chairman of the National General Mobilization Council.</p>

<h3>Turkey Denies Joining the War; Maintains Neutrality and is Not Tempted by Anything; Churchill's Visit Only Has Propaganda Value</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: The Director of the Turkish Government Information Office, Safa, met with reporters after the Adana Conference and absolutely denied that British Prime Minister Churchill had asked Turkey to join the war, and announced that Turkey had not accepted this constraint.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: A Swedish newspaper's correspondent in London cabled that London was surprised by the talks between Turkish President Ismet and British Prime Minister Churchill in Adana. Officials have not commented on this, only saying that what the British government is interested in is Turkey's continued neutrality. However, British newspapers generally believe that the meeting is related to future Mediterranean battles. This can be evidenced by the fact that important figures in the British military participated in the meeting. Some London newspapers even believe that the Adana Conference is a chain encircling Germany, and that the meeting between Ismet and Churchill must have been approved by Stalin in advance. The Soviet Union is also very concerned about the issue of the Dardanelles Strait. It is not known whether this issue was also discussed at the meeting. However, the main obstacle to the Allies transporting war materials to the Soviet Union through the Dardanelles Strait is not the Montreux Convention, but Germany's control of the Aegean Sea.</p>
<p>Ankara, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: After Ambassador Hugessen met with Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Vinogradov yesterday, he met with Turkish reporters and stated his impressions of the Adana Conference. It is said that what was discussed was how Turkey's military preparations were. If Turkey is attacked, the Allies will assist it. The possibility of supplying Turkey with military supplies was also discussed.</p>
<p>Ankara, 3rd, Haiying News Agency Dispatch: The Turkish government issued a statement on the Adana Conference the night before. Political and diplomatic circles here are discussing it enthusiastically, but the newspapers here have not yet discussed it. All parties are paying attention to three points in the statement: (1) The statement is a Turkish declaration, not a joint British-Turkish statement. (2) The statement does not mention the British-Turkish alliance of 1939. (3) The statement does not mention Soviet-Turkish relations either. People in Ankara say that although Churchill tried his best to explain to Turkey that the Soviet Union had no intentions towards Turkey, it probably did not succeed. They were surprised that British Foreign Secretary Eden made a report on the Adana Conference in the House of Commons. Eden stated that Churchill only explained to Turkey the United Kingdom's organization for various issues and did not agree on solutions. However, in reality, all issues were resolved in accordance with Turkey's neutral attitude.</p>
<p>Ankara, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: An American reporter here believes that Churchill's trip to Turkey is because Britain wants to drive the United States out of the Near East. It is also learned here that the American Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, was invited to attend the Adana Conference, but he refused. This is enough to prove that British and American opinions on the Near East issue are not consistent. In addition, there are also disagreements between Britain and the United States on the establishment of an Allied Supreme Commander in the Near East. But in fact, Britain has already gained an advantage. It is believed here that a British officer will take the position of Allied Supreme Commander in the Near East.</p>
<h3>Turkish Foreign Minister Meets German Ambassador</h3>
<p>Ankara, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu met with German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen yesterday and, in accordance with the Turkish-German Friendship Treaty, informed the German Ambassador of the progress of the meeting between the Turkish President and the British Prime Minister in Adana.</p>
<h3>Axis Powers Have No Intention of Attacking Turkey</h3>
<p>Madrid, 3rd, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: "ABC" commented on the Adana Conference today, saying that Berlin and Rome remain calm after learning of Churchill's visit to Turkey, which shows that the Axis powers have no intention of attacking Turkey. In addition, Turkey's participation in the war must be after its borders are attacked. Therefore, the British-Turkish alliance concluded at the Adana Conference has no military significance.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Visited Cyprus</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd, Haitong News Agency The British Prime Minister Churchill and the Turkish President Ismet held a meeting in Adana, probably due to Turkey's suggestion that the British and Americans hope to use Turkey's airports as a base for air raids on the Balkans. It is not known whether Churchill has made this wish. On his way back, he visited the island of Cyprus, which is the base for Britain's attack on the Dodecanese Islands and Crete. Recently, the Turkish newspaper "Ulus" stated that Turkey will strictly adhere to neutrality and will not be tempted by any promises, which clearly refers to the Allies' suggestion of sacrificing Syria. The newspaper declared that Turkey would not change its policy because German forces entered the Caucasus or British forces reached Tripoli, but if Turkey's territory is threatened, Turkey will resolutely fight. The victory of the Soviet army will not change Turkey's attitude. Turkey is well aware of the Soviet Union's ambitions for the Straits, which is why Ismet met with Churchill to discuss post-war issues.</p>
<h3>Valiant Winter Warfare Between Germany and the Soviet Union: The German Army's Elite Displays Its Military Might, the Red Army Tries to Counterattack Unsuccessfully</h3>
<p>On the Eastern Front in winter, the German army has indeed launched a valiant battle. German and allied forces are fighting amidst wind and snow. The Soviets are besieging the German army around Stalingrad, while simultaneously dispatching large forces in three routes – south, north, and central – directly towards Rostov, with considerable momentum. The German army is holding its ground and resisting, but has been unable to stem the tide. In the fierce battles, there are many tragic and beautiful stories. According to reports from German propaganda units, frontline soldiers have shown many heroic actions, from which one can imagine that the German army has indeed performed earth-shattering and soul-stirring actions in defensive battles since the beginning of the war. The news of the fall of Tripoli has reached the front lines, certainly not creating a positive impression psychologically. However, compared to the importance of the situation on the Eastern Front, the fall of Tripoli is a minor issue. The German people are able to understand the meaning of total national involvement in the war, as explained by the government, and anxiously await the frontline soldiers to fight bravely, closely monitoring the movements on the Eastern Front. The following is a brief report on the important developments of the second German-Soviet winter campaign:</p>
<p>The Situation on the Eastern Front is Serious</p>
<p>On January 22, the German army suddenly announced to the nation that the situation on the Eastern Front was serious. Initially, the German people only knew that the Soviet army had launched a winter offensive since November of last year, with fierce battles raging on the Eastern Front daily, but the details of the battle were unclear. The authorities initially announced, "We have severely damaged the Red Army and repelled their attacks," but suddenly on January 22, they announced that the German forces defending Stalingrad, despite fighting bravely, were ultimately unable to stop the advance of the Red Army and had no choice but to shift their positions, retreating several kilometers. Acknowledging that the German army had retreated on the Eastern Caucasus front, the German people now realized that the German army in Stalingrad had been heavily besieged and felt that the situation was difficult to handle. Since the beginning of the war, German announcements had never been so unfavorable. On January 23, the German army made the following announcement: "The German forces in Stalingrad are fighting bravely in the midst of heavy enemy encirclement. The German forces in the North Caucasus are shifting to the rear, and the retreat is proceeding smoothly."</p>
<p>On January 24, they further stated:</p>
<p>"The winter campaign on the Eastern Front lifeline is becoming increasingly intense. The situation in Stalingrad has deteriorated further due to the Red Army's offensive from the west. Although the Red Army around Stalingrad is gradually shortening the encirclement, the German soldiers are still able to hold their positions. This spirit of courage and fighting prowess is truly a model for German soldiers."</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in the North Caucasus, they frankly announced, acknowledging that the situation was serious and difficult to handle, stating that "due to strategic necessity, the German army has reorganized and reduced the southern front, and the battlefield has shifted to the area of Kropotkin (transliteration)."</p>
<p>The Red Army Disregards Troop Losses</p>
<p>The retreat route for the German army in Stalingrad to the west was cut off several days ago, leading to isolation and encirclement. However, the German authorities' sudden announcement has hidden reasons. The news released by the German army in the past three days, along with the arguments starting to appear in German newspapers at the same time, corresponded to the "PK War Correspondent's Diary" from the front lines. When reading it, one can imagine the scene of the German army fighting bloody battles on a front line with heavy snow and frozen ground. In late November of last year, after the ground froze, the Soviet army used elite troops equipped and trained for winter warfare to launch a counterattack on the southern front. The German army had already gained valuable lessons in last year's winter campaign, and similarly, the Red Army had also undergone effective winter warfare training to deal with the German army, using a large amount of manpower and weapons to launch attacks. The Red Army broke through the German positions between the Volga River and the Don River from the north and south, aiming to recapture Rostov as the target of the Red Army's winter offensive and advance forward. After recapturing the strategic point of Rostov, the retreat route for the German army entering the Caucasus could be cut off. The Maikop oilfield area and the Kuban granary area were once seized from the German army. At the same time, capturing the German industrial area was also one of the Red Army's winter warfare objectives. The Red Army advanced towards Rostov in three routes:</p>
<p>The Central Army moved west along the east-west railway in the center of the Don River bend. The Northern Army broke through the weak points of the Axis forces near Migulinskaya and Kalitovskaya in the upper reaches of the Don River, advancing directly south towards Millerovo and Kamensk-Shakhtinsky. The Southern Army suddenly appeared in the Kalmyk steppe area, one team advancing west along the lower reaches of the Don River, and another team advancing west along the railway between Stalingrad and Krasnodar.</p>
<p>All three routes were spearheaded by a large number of tank units, breaking through the familiar snowy plains occupied by the German army. The German army resolutely resisted everywhere, but the central and northern fronts were insufficiently prepared for winter positional warfare, and the southern front was not prepared for defensive warfare at all. Under the Red Army's superior forces and reckless attacks, they had no choice but to make a "strategic retreat" to avoid losses, retreating to locations with fortified defensive positions in Rostov.</p>
<p>The German Troops in Stalingrad are Heroic</p>
<p>For weeks, the only way to supply the isolated troops in Stalingrad with food and ammunition has been through air transport. The plight of the German soldiers who did not pursue the retreating enemy after the fierce battles last summer deserves sympathy. However, the Red Army, harboring revenge for the German army's attack last summer, is tightening its encirclement day by day. The number of German troops inside the circle is certainly not small. In addition, there was a precedent in the winter of the previous year where isolated troops besieged for three months broke through the encirclement. However, the German troops in Stalingrad are fighting to their last bullet for their country. German newspapers cannot help but express their gratitude and offer words of encouragement, just like the scene of the battleship Bismarck fighting bravely. In view of the difficulty of replenishment from the supply depot, the Red Army's situation, the battlefield situation, and the isolated German troops, it is quite difficult to break out of the encirclement. Moreover, due to the constraints of the severe winter season, it is impossible to rescue these isolated troops. Therefore, the only option is to resist to the end, awaiting the start of the third German spring offensive. The realization of this miracle is the aspiration shared by the German people on the front lines and in the rear. The PK war correspondents from Germany, Osstenert and Zannkner, sent to their homeland's press from Stalingrad the tragic war situation, and their emotions of grief and excitement overflowed between the lines, more like a prose poem than news.</p>
<p>The trial by fire in the Stalingrad furnace has forged a type of German soldier. Soldiers deeply trapped in the hellish trap are worthy of their name. Even amidst the flames and explosions, the fighting spirit of our soldiers remains strong and undiminished. It is a pity that humans are not machines, and their energy is limited. On the Stalingrad front, there are still soldiers who participated in the Kharkov battle of the previous winter and the rapid attacks of last summer. New missions repeatedly fall on these soldiers, preventing them from alternating with new comrades. The number of soldiers in companies, battalions, and regiments decreases day by day. Although the communication route with the outside world has been cut off, their spirit never shrinks. The reason for this is only their instinctive self-awareness. Unaware of fatigue, unaware of spiritual destruction, these are the brave men of our city, enduring the most brutal trials with superhuman strength, even knowing that they cannot extricate themselves, they still resolutely fight for their country. The battle of Stalingrad is not only unprecedented, but may also be the last of its kind. The battles before our eyes are proceeding at their highest point, reaching white heat.</p>
<p>German Public Opinion Rises Up in Unison</p>
<p>The Red Army's fierce winter offensive is raging in all locations on the eastern front, including the central Caucasus, western Caucasus, the area near Velikiye Luki on the central front, and the area south of Lake Ilmen. The Axis forces suffered greatly in the winter of the previous year, but it was far less severe than this winter. The setbacks of the German army in the winter of the previous year can be attributed to the German army's lack of preparation for the cold attacks. The characteristic of this year's "winter formation" is that the Red Army is carrying an astonishing number of troops, a large force fully equipped for winter, constantly increasing from the rear, and behind this large force, there is a smooth transportation organization. This issue is very serious, and the resistance of the Red Army cannot be taken lightly. According to the figures published by the German army, a total of 6,291 Red Army tanks were destroyed in the winter campaign from November 20 of last year to January 24 of this year. However, even after losing this large number of tanks, the Red Army's offensive is still extremely fierce. Due to this fact, the German General Staff cannot fundamentally change its highest operational policy in the conduct of the war against the Soviet Union. The German "Ahkemer Nai Report" on the 23rd called it "the largest storm in Asia since Genghis Khan." The "Heirkichia Baiopai Hatai Report" on the 24th used a large headline: "Can the Soviet Union Win?" The acute expression of the crisis in the East conveyed to the people by the press is noteworthy.</p>

<h3>Allied Forces in Central Tunisia Driven Out of Newly Occupied Positions; German and Italian Aircraft Attack Bona Port in Batches at Night</h3>
<p>Berlin, March 3, Huitong News Agency. Allied forces in central Tunisia were driven out of their most recently occupied positions yesterday by Axis forces. Small enemy units were completely annihilated. Enemy forces concentrated troops southeast of Al Ada in an attempt to attack, but were routed by Axis artillery. German dive bombers destroyed four enemy tanks and thirteen trucks southeast of Thebes. German and Italian aircraft carried out night raids on Bona Port in batches. Important facilities in the port were directly hit. In aerial combat, five Allied aircraft were shot down, including two four-engine bombers.</p>
<p>Stockholm, March 3, Huitong News Agency. According to the London correspondent of the "Swedish Daily News," well-informed sources in London are deeply disappointed with the situation in Tunisia. The Allied forces' major offensive in the area will be shelved again because several problems have not yet been resolved. The Axis forces' positions in northern Tunisia are very strong, making it easy to defend. The Allied forces' attempt to prevent the German and Italian armored vehicles retreating from Tripolitania from joining forces with General Arnim's troops has failed. The Axis forces have built impregnable fortresses on the high ground near Tunis. The first line of defense is equipped with machine gun nests, connected by tunnels. Behind the machine gun nests are grenade launchers with a range of two and a half kilometers, more powerful than the Allied grenade launchers. The Axis forces' third line of defense is equipped with large-caliber artillery with a diameter of eighty centimeters, powerful enough to repel any enemy advance. All of the German army's sixty-two-ton heavy tanks are incredibly powerful, and the troops guarding the high ground are all elite soldiers, each knowing how to fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Churchill Will Visit Portugal</h3>
<p>Madrid, March 3, Central News Agency. According to Lisbon sources, there are rumors in the area that Churchill will visit Portugal on his way back to England. It is said that political and diplomatic circles attach great importance to this.</p>
<h3>Admiral Dönitz Arrives in the German Capital</h3>
<p>Berlin, March 3, Huitong News Agency. Admiral Dönitz arrived in Berlin yesterday to take office as Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy.</p>
<h3>Japan-Bulgaria Association Elects Honorary Members</h3>
<p>Sofia, March 3, Huitong News Agency. The recently established Tokyo Japan-Bulgaria Association has elected the Governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, Gornayev, and the Mayor of Sofia, Ivanov, as honorary members.</p>
<h3>Vietnam Restricts Automobile Traffic</h3>
<p>Saigon, March 3, Huitong News Agency. Due to a shortage of alcohol, the Vietnamese government has ordered a reduction of one-third in the number of automobiles in operation. Alcohol will not be allocated unless absolutely necessary. It is said that the reason for the alcohol shortage is that the sulfuric acid used to refine alcohol cannot be imported.</p>
<h3>The Powerful Tojo Cabinet (3)</h3>
<p>Director of the Valley Information Bureau and Director-General of the Moriyama Legislation Bureau</p>
<p>Director-General Moriyama of the Legislation Bureau was born in Hachiman-cho, Kuwana City, and graduated from the Eighth Higher Normal School, followed by the Faculty of Law at Tokyo University. He received a pure legal education from the Legislation Bureau, and is well-versed in the constitution, having served as an administrative examination commissioner. He is amiable and approachable, and possesses a sincere personality. In terms of gentleness, he is superior to Director of the Valley Information Bureau, but lacks Director Valley’s self-restraint. Moriyama is valued for his character. Therefore, he is an indispensable figure in the current cabinet for dealing with the Privy Council, and is deeply trusted by Prime Minister Tojo. Within the Legislation Bureau, he has no political ambitions. His straightforward nature, tempered by political experience, could make him a first-class politician. Subordinates and the general public have a high opinion of him. It can be said that his contribution is to ensure the smooth relationship between the Tojo cabinet and the Privy Council.</p>
<p>Many believed that Director of the Valley Information Bureau was not very suitable for the position of Foreign Minister. When the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry was shelved, the position of Foreign Minister was temporarily held concurrently by Prime Minister Tojo. The cause of Valley's appointment, to which various parties paid extraordinary attention, made the Tojo cabinet's "comrade cabinet" color more pronounced. Valley once served as the Director of the Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At that time, Joint Intelligence Minister Toshi Shiratori and young military officers promoted hard-line diplomacy, for which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was praised. Later, he separated from Shiratori and became the ambassador to France, refusing the French government's excessive hospitality and enduring unfortunate days. Also, when the Abe cabinet planned to establish a Ministry of Trade, Valley, then Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, opposed it along with Foreign Minister Nomura. All senior officials from the director to the lower levels of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted their resignations, and the mid-level and young members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also expressed their sympathy. Soon, things took a turn for the better. He was promoted by Tojo to be the Director of the Cabinet Information Bureau, and became one of the four senior officials of the cabinet. Perhaps his past good reputation led to his appointment as Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>After taking office as Foreign Minister, Valley used his own experience as a blueprint and appointed new executives such as Vice Minister Matsumoto. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has taken on a new look since the promotion of Vice Minister Matsumoto and Director of Political Affairs Kamimura. These new elites are determined to assist Valley, and therefore, Valley has now become very successful and a prominent figure. However, he remains humble and cautious, and is not satisfied with his current achievements. The positions of the four senior officials who bear the heavy responsibility for the country during wartime have been described above. Whether or not the right people are chosen for these positions is crucial to the future of the country. It goes without saying that all the cabinet staff members, under the influence of Prime Minister Tojo, should be united and establish a true wartime posture. The four senior officials should also be integrated as one, maintaining a serious attitude to live up to the country's trust.</p>
<p>Enduring Hardship Together and Sharing the Burden</p>
<p>Securing the future victory of the Greater East Asia War is full of thorns. The general public is well aware of the significance and difficulty of this teaching, and therefore, their determination to win has become even stronger.</p>
<p>Recently, the various measures taken to boost the morale of the people have not been foolproof. The leaders of the Information Bureau are serious about their own conduct and are working to strengthen the internal unity of the country.</p>
<p>It should be the same on the front lines as in the economic world. Mr. Fujiyama, the head of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, "Is it really the best and most effective method to guide the people with tactics that emphasize ingenuity rather than honesty?" This straightforward statement is indeed very reasonable. Of course, this is by no means criticizing the government's policies. The government's loud calls to awaken the people. Likewise, the economic world cannot but deeply reflect on itself now. Where should the government's administration start? Is it not the major issue that has become a problem these days? Spiritual mobilization means making people do their best in their own positions, regardless of success or failure. In the economic sector, should we not properly plan the fundamental policy of production expansion, and put all our efforts into it and resolutely implement it? Recently, during this war, discussions on abolishing corporate profits have been heard among the people. In this unprecedented situation, company management orders, wage control orders, and other control economic measures still have not abandoned the old concept of pursuing profits, and have prevented the expansion of production. If this is not the government's intention, then now is the best time for the government leaders to take decisive action. For the sake of the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War, the concept of profit should be abandoned, and all the people should share the burden with the spirit of being micro-employed. Now is the best opportunity to establish timely strategies. There should be straightforward and concrete expressions. Prompting the people to realize the importance of the situation. If someone loses courage due to the difficulties of the future, if someone uses this as a tool to criticize the political situation, if there are such people at this time, then the government leaders must seek a thorough strategy to eliminate non-nationals. The enemy, Britain, has arguments about stationing troops in six major cities after conquering Japan. Even if we did not know this argument, it is not difficult to imagine the scene if Japan were to be defeated in this war. We must not retreat a step, and even if we know the difficulties ahead, we must move forward on this difficult path. It is strange that the phrase "臥薪嘗膽" (sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall – enduring hardship to achieve revenge) has not yet appeared in newspapers.</p>
<p>Now is the time to devote the nation's strength to winning victory. Here, we have high expectations for the current central force, the four senior officials of the cabinet. Therefore, if there are any inappropriate words in this article, please forgive them with the magnanimity mentioned in the text. (End)</p>

<h3>Internal Opposition in the United States Severely Criticizes the Government; Roosevelt Met with Reporters Yesterday and Was Questioned About the North Africa Conference</h3>
<p>Stockholm, March 3, Huitong News Agency. According to Washington sources, President Roosevelt has found that the opposition's momentum has rebounded after the Casablanca Conference. His failure to appoint Flynn as ambassador to Australia was a measure to avoid criticism. The strength of the isolationists has also increased. Wilkie's criticism of the government is particularly severe. However, British newspapers point out that the American public's opposition to Roosevelt is not an expression of anti-British sentiment. The Republican Party will continue the war even when it is in power.</p>
<p>Lisbon, March 3, Huitong News Agency. New York</p>
<p>The "New York Herald Tribune" on Friday called Secretary of State Hull "America's constitutional nanny." This is the most severe attack on Hull in his ten years in office. Any reporter who questioned Hull about the North African events was rebuked by Hull. Some newspapers have demanded that the State Department recall Murphy, because his character, training, and previous occupation and environment are not suitable for serving as General Eisenhower's political advisor.</p>
<p>Lisbon, March 3, Tongmeng News Agency. According to Washington, U.S. President Roosevelt met with reporters yesterday for an hour. The reporters criticized why Chongqing representatives were not invited to the Casablanca Conference. Roosevelt replied that Chongqing was geographically unable to launch an offensive, so this move was more appropriate. Some people thought that Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek could easily participate in the meeting, but these people have forgotten that the Soviet Union has not declared war on Japan, and although Chongqing has nominally declared war on Germany, it is actually hindered by the terrain. Someone asked if Stalin agreed to the plan decided at the meeting. Roosevelt did not answer, only saying that it was a matter of secrecy, and it was not appropriate to discuss whether he agreed or disagreed. As for what developments the Casablanca meeting would produce, Roosevelt was also unwilling to answer.</p>
<h3>Rumor That the Roosevelt-Churchill Conference Had Three Decisions</h3>
<p>Vichy, March 3, Havas News Agency. According to Berlin sources, the main points decided at the Casablanca Conference by U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill are as follows: (1) This year, concentrate all efforts in the Mediterranean, first intensifying the bombing of Italy, and then attacking the Italian military positions on the Dodecanese Islands and the German-occupied Crete in the spring; (2) Temporarily do not reinforce the Soviet Union, and use the threat of submarine warfare as an excuse for not being able to reinforce the Soviet Union; (3) Increase pressure on Turkey to participate in the war within the year, and promise Syria and Lebanon as conditions for participating in the war.</p>
<h3>How Does a Solar Eclipse Occur?</h3>
<p>How does a solar eclipse occur? The Earth revolves around the sun, and the moon revolves around the Earth. And the sun is constantly moving at an astonishing speed. During this orderly movement, when the sun, Earth, and moon are aligned in a straight line, the phenomenon of an "eclipse" occurs. At this time, if the moon is between the Earth and the sun, it becomes a solar eclipse. If the Earth is between the sun and the moon, blocking the light coming from the sun, so that no sunlight is reflected on the moon, it becomes a lunar eclipse. In other words, the phenomenon of a solar eclipse is the sun casting the moon's shadow on the Earth. When standing in its shadow and looking at the sun, the state of the moon overlapping with the sun is a total solar eclipse. However, even though the moon is between the Earth and the sun, if the sun seen from the Earth is larger in shape than the moon, a total solar eclipse will not occur, but an annular eclipse will occur. That is, at this time, around the dark moon, a golden and brilliant ring of the sun can be seen, which is quite a beautiful sight. However, like partial eclipses, annular eclipses are not a major problem from the perspective of astronomers.</p>
<p>Moreover, ordinary solar eclipses are by no means rare phenomena. Although there are limited periods of time in a year when they can occur, they are usually called solar eclipse seasons. Approximately every one hundred and seventy-three days, there is always a place on Earth where a solar eclipse can be seen. That is, there are always two, or occasionally three, solar eclipses visible on Earth in a year. According to calculations, after this solar eclipse, Japan will encounter total solar eclipses again on July 21, 2623 (translator's note: this year is Japanese year 2603) in eastern Hokkaido, on July 31, 2641 in central Sakhalin Island, on March 18, 2648 in the eastern sea of the Ogasawara Islands, and on July 22, 2669 in the Ryukyu Islands. However, all of these will be hindered by the sea and other locations and times, and have little value for observation. In the end, the black sun that visits the Noto Peninsula and the Kanto region will not appear until September 2, 2695! It is unlikely that there will be observations on the mainland of Japan.</p>
<p>That is, in the ninety-two years after the total eclipse on February 5 this year, there will be no more solar eclipses in Japan. Therefore, modern Japanese people will rarely see another solar eclipse in their lifetime after seeing this one. This is the reason why this solar eclipse is so important, and it also has the meaning of leaving the valuable data of present Japanese science to future generations. Also, although it is the same total solar eclipse, the moon's shadow cast on the Earth is sometimes large and sometimes small. This is because the distances between the sun, the moon, and the Earth are constantly changing. The moon's shadow cast on the Earth during a solar eclipse becomes a band due to the Earth's rotation, rushing across the surface of the Earth. Therefore, the time for which a total solar eclipse can be seen at a certain location within the solar eclipse circle on Earth is very short, but the larger the shadow, the longer the time. If the time is short, observation is naturally difficult. The total solar eclipse time on February 5 is "one minute and fifty-three seconds." This is only a few seconds shorter than the total solar eclipse seen in Hokkaido on June 19, Showa 11 (Republic of China 25), and is sufficient for thorough research. However, this one minute and fifty-three seconds is truly a precious time that scholars cannot buy for thousands of dollars. Therefore, the lively and busy observation at that time will cause more than fifty Japanese scholars related to astronomy to rack their brains and challenge the "black sun."

<p>The diagram illustrates the solar eclipse on February 5th, visible across Japan, Manchuria, Manchukuo, eastern China, the Philippines, eastern Siberia, eastern Alaska, and the west coast of the United States. The area where the total solar eclipse can be seen is limited to the 180-kilometer-wide strip in the center of the diagram, indicated by three lines. As shown in the diagram, this line starts from eastern Manchuria, passes through central Hokkaido in Japan, and reaches the coast of Alaska. The line on the left end of the diagram (Manchuria, mainland China) indicates sunrise and the end of the eclipse; the second line (Hokkaido) indicates the start of the eclipse after sunrise; the area east of the line on the right end, namely the mainland United States, indicates the start of the eclipse after sunset; the second line from the right indicates the end of the eclipse and sunset. In summary, Hokkaido is located in the total solar eclipse zone, with the boundary line passing through it. The solar eclipse starts after sunrise (i.e., 7:50 AM).</p>

<h3>Silver and Money Trades Announce Year-End Settlement Methods: Returned Checks Must Be Cleared on the Same Day; Four-Day Holiday Starts Tomorrow, Reopening on the 9th</h3>
<p>Today is Lunar New Year's Eve, the deadline for year-end settlements for all trades. The Bankers' Joint Reserve Association and the Money Trade Joint Reserve Treasury have agreed on the settlement and clearing times for members. As for the external business hours of various banks and firms, they remain as usual from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, while internal hours are extended to handle settlements. All trades have been fully prepared for the year-end settlement. Overdrafts between banks and firms have been adjusted, and funds have been fully repaid to maintain commercial credit. Most of the previously extended customer accounts have been recovered. At a time of soaring prices for goods, it is expected that the settlement results will yield significant profits. As for the regulation of finance, it remains stable and consistent through the adjustment of the Central Reserve Bank and the Silver Association's treasury. The money supply is even looser than in previous years at the end of the national calendar year. The market's foreign exchange rate yesterday was one and four-tenths of a cent, so all trades have safely passed this year-end settlement period.</p>
<p>Silver Association Announces Settlement Methods</p>
<p>The Bankers' Joint Reserve Committee issued a notice to member banks stating, "Respectfully informing you that February 4th (Thursday) is the deadline for year-end settlements. The settlement time for members will be appropriately extended as usual. For the convenience of settlement for various clearing banks, the exchange times for this day have been specifically set as follows: (1) Exchange time: 5:00 PM; (2) Deadline for clearing banks entrusting the Association to deposit exchangeable instruments: 4:30 PM; (3) Deadline for the Association's corresponding members to deposit exchangeable instruments: 4:15 PM; (4) Deadline for depositing various collection instruments: as usual; (5) Deadline for correspondent accounts to replenish funds and the Association to transfer payment instruments: 8:00 PM; (6) Returned checks must be cleared on the same day. In addition to the announcement at the clearinghouse, a corresponding circular is hereby sent for your information and compliance."</p>
<h3>Discrepancies in the Date of Rice Distribution in the City: The Truth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipality Grain Bureau, stating, "Having read three comments in the 'Readers' Forum' of your newspaper on February 3rd regarding the distribution of rice based on household size, the main points are roughly about the lack of quantity, delays in dates, and incomplete flour allocations. As the responsible department, we hereby provide the following explanation based on facts. Due to personnel matters, this bureau is temporarily taking the period from late October of last year to the end of January of this year as one phase. Although the dates for distributing rice based on household size have not been fixed, resulting in discrepancies, the number of distributions has never been less. Counting from the end of October to the end of January, there have been a total of ten rice distributions (one in late January, which is the public sale on the 2nd of this month; the original draft was likely written on February 1st, hence the mention of one distribution still owed in January). We ask the commenting gentlemen, whether in Nanshi or Huxi, to carefully recall the number of periods to see if any are missing. However, the rice purchase certificates in Nanshi are continuous, starting from period 19 in late October to period 25 at the end of December, totaling seven periods. The middle two weeks in early and mid-October were skipped and not issued. If calculated cumulatively, it is often mistaken as two missed periods. This is a clear and obvious fact. The first period of February is also currently being shipped and will be publicly sold soon. Therefore, since late October of last year, we have been very regretful that the number of public sales periods has not been fixed, but we dare say that no periods have been missed. As for the lack of quantity, it is sometimes true. There are many reasons for this, but the quantity specified in the bureau's announcement shall prevail. As for other private deductions, it is difficult for the bureau to monitor all of them, and it is difficult to prevent petty theft. We hope that people from all walks of life will report them at any time. As for the incomplete flour allocation, we have agreed with the relevant parties to make up for it soon. In short, since the black market for rice was cut off, the rice distribution is the main source of food for the people. As the department in charge, we will do our best to improve it. (A table of public sales for each period is attached separately.) Respectfully, Shanghai Special Municipality Grain Bureau, February 3rd, 32nd year."</p>
<h3>On Guiding Idle Capital to Promote Production in Chinese-Owned Factories</h3>
<p>— Li Quanshi</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Economic Yearbook, there is approximately 8 billion yuan of idle capital existing in Shanghai society. In the past, this huge amount of idle capital was used in foreign exchange, scalping, cloth, foreign stocks, food, and real estate. Since the authorities have been actively cracking down on speculation, the scope of activities for idle capital has been narrowing. If this huge financial power is not guided into the right track of production, it will seek objects for its restless movement at any time and anywhere, disrupting the stability of Shanghai's economy. In recent years, due to the special environment and the ever-changing international political and economic situation, those who possess capital consider it more profitable to engage in speculation and seek exorbitant profits. Furthermore, due to the instability of the currency system and the high prices of goods, the income from deposit interest is not enough to offset the loss in the value of money. As a result, fixed-term deposits in banks have drastically decreased. Even if there are some current deposits, they are only temporary in nature, ready for speculative use at any time, thus becoming a type of idle capital that fuels the speculative market.</p>
<p>Currently, while the authorities are actively cracking down on speculation in a passive manner, they should also actively guide idle capital into production channels, turning speculation into investment to increase the supply of goods. However, based on the experience of earning profits over the past few years, those who possess idle capital believe that the use of funds will hardly arouse their interest unless the following three conditions are met: (1) a huge absorption capacity, (2) a high degree of variability, and (3) substantial profits. Currently, the only market in Shanghai that can meet the conditions for absorbing idle capital is the Chinese stock market. Therefore, after the authorities cracked down on speculation, the inflow of idle capital into the Chinese stock market is an inevitable trend. Under the premise of centralizing and strengthening the work of various production departments to adapt to the wartime economic system, the inflow of idle capital into the Chinese stock market, transforming the nature of harming society into funds for enhancing production, is a gratifying thing from the perspective of national financial and economic policies and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>However, as a result of high prices and rampant speculation in recent years, the general public has somewhat of a fearful attitude towards market activities. Therefore, the inflow of idle capital into the Chinese stock market has stimulated a general rise in Chinese stock prices. Later, due to the unclear understanding of investment and speculation, it caused undue anxiety, leading to rumors of controlling Chinese stock price limits and cracking down on speculation, which were widespread. We know that cracking down on speculation and eliminating the black market are the consistent policies of the authorities to safeguard wartime finance and protect the people's livelihood. All citizens should always sincerely support this. Therefore, the inflow of idle capital into the Chinese stock market, turning speculation into investment, is also something that the industrial and commercial sectors have been seeking day and night. If the rise in Chinese stock prices is considered to be a sign of speculation, then abandoning eating for fear of choking is not the way to implement wartime economic policies, maintain production, and protect people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Guiding idle capital into production channels is something that the authorities and society eagerly hope for, and it is an important item in the process of implementing wartime economic policies. In principle, there is no problem. What should be discussed now is the method of transforming idle capital into production funds, that is, how can the two major sources of idle capital remaining in society be incorporated into production channels? We must realize that although there are as many as 8 billion yuan of idle capital in Shanghai, they are all scattered funds without a proper organization. Just look at the wandering of idle capital, sometimes engaging in foreign exchange and sometimes in cloth. Controlling and managing it will only cause idle capital to flow from one speculative market to another, and it cannot be thoroughly prevented and used for the benefit of the country. Therefore, guiding idle capital into production, building a capital market, and promoting Chinese stock trading seem to be simple and effective methods. Furthermore, establishing a trading place for Chinese commercial and industrial securities was publicly advocated before the war. The results of the trial implementation in recent years seem to be considerable. Moreover, Chinese stocks are suitable for the above-mentioned three conditions for stable investment. The prosperity of Chinese stock trading allows the poor and weak production sector in our country to obtain the necessary funds in the open market, directly increasing the productivity of the production sector, and indirectly increasing the materials needed for wartime. Therefore, the flourishing of Chinese stock trading is a phenomenon with more advantages than disadvantages in this extraordinary period. Even if it is not promoted, how can it be limited?</p>
<p>Some say that the current trading of Chinese stocks is speculation rather than investment. If that is the case, then starting a production business can also be regarded as speculation rather than investment. The nature of Chinese stocks is an investment security, not a speculative chip. The current rise in Chinese stock prices is a necessary reflection of the rise in prices of the materials represented by Chinese stocks. The increase in the value of factory assets leads to an increase in the value of Chinese stocks backed by materials, which is also an inevitable trend. Therefore, to prevent Chinese stock prices from rising, we must first seek to prevent the prices of general goods from rising. And the unchanging dividend does not affect the unchanging stock price. This phenomenon is not only true in our country, but all countries have this experience during wartime. For example, the International Economic Weekly reported the situation of the Japanese stock market in 1942 as shown in the table below:</p>
<p>The recent rise in Japanese stock prices is unprecedented. Although the margin deposit has been repeatedly increased, those who seek them are still not slack. The increase in stock value is a reflection of the increase in the value of industrial tools. Industrial development is an element of increasing materials. The increase in materials can show the fullness of national power and is a prerequisite for victory in the war. In the era of East Asian nations seeking liberation, striving for industrial development is an essential task. Then, how can stock trading, which promotes the flow of production funds, be restricted?</p>
<p>Some believe that the rise in stock market prices is enough to stimulate the rise in commodity prices. This is putting the cart before the horse, because stocks represent materials, and the rise in commodity prices causes stock prices to rise, not the rise in stock prices stimulating the rise in commodity prices. We should recognize this point so as not to mistake investment for speculation. If various restrictions are imposed on the trading of Chinese stocks, the resulting malpractices will be enough to force the huge amount of idle capital in society to escape or flow back to the channels of hoarding and speculation. It is not a way to enforce wartime economic policies and stabilize people's livelihoods, and the lack of funds, reduced production, and unemployment of workers in Chinese-owned factories, is this stabilizing society or disrupting society! Is it building a wartime economy or harming a wartime economy? This is a question that can be decided without discussion. Moreover, what percentage of this 8 billion yuan of idle capital has flowed into the Chinese stock market? There is no statistics yet. In this era of strained industrial funds, it is not a problem to have idle capital fully incorporated into production. We only need to look at the trend of the evolution of equity capital in Japan in the past five years to know the necessity of expanding production funds during wartime!</p>
<p>The total capital of Shanghai's industrial sector certainly cannot be compared with Japan, but if all 8 billion yuan are invested in the Chinese stock market, compared with Japan's industrial capital, it is still like a small witch seeing a great witch. In this era of East Asian nations competing with Britain and the United States for survival, we should take on a portion of the responsibility, develop production, enrich wartime materials, and enable us to achieve final victory in the Pacific War. Therefore, allowing the open trading of Chinese stocks, enabling the industrial sector to obtain the necessary funds to enhance production capacity, seems to be a wise measure. If a few entrepreneurs raise stock market prices without rectifying the content of their businesses, then we should also rise up to condemn them and impose public opinion sanctions.</p>

<h3>Enthusiastic Individuals from Chinese and Japanese Circles Encourage This Newspaper to Support Education; Mayor Chen Donates a Large Sum to Reward Needy Students; Mr. Taketoyo Ayatsuhiko Makes Generous Donations</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the Fourth Annual Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, we have been honored with praise from all sectors of society. While we are moved and encouraged, we are also deeply ashamed. Yesterday, we were honored by Mayor Chen's generous donation and encouragement. Mr. Ayatsuhiko Ayatsu of Japan sent money from Tokyo, more than 11,000 yuan, to support our newspaper's education assistance movement. We are also deeply impressed by the enthusiastic donations from people from all walks of life to benefit students and cultivate youth. We hereby express our sincere gratitude on behalf of the aided students.</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's Letter</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from Mayor Chen Gongbo, stating, "Recently, I have seen that your newspaper is raising scholarships to benefit needy students, which I deeply appreciate. At this difficult time, cultivating talent is particularly urgent. Gongbo respectfully expresses his enthusiasm and concern for this endeavor. I am enclosing 5,000 yuan in national currency for your review and acceptance, to be used for scholarships, and I hope you will work hard to promote it for greater achievement. Yours sincerely, Chen Gongbo, February 2nd."</p>
<p>Mr. Ayatsuhiko Ayatsu's Letter</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Ryoichiro Kimura and Mr. Docha Hirao of the Shanghai branch of the Asahi Shimbun delivered a remittance of 11,111.20 yuan from Mr. Ayatsuhiko Ayatsu of Tokyo, to be donated as scholarships, and enclosed a letter stating, "Recently, the lives of poor people in China, who are suffering from hunger and cold, are everywhere. And young students who are deprived of education due to poverty are experiencing a great spiritual pain. Recognizing this, Shen Bao has launched social movements such as scholarship assistance and poverty relief. This benevolent and righteous act is admirable. The education of young men and women should not be neglected for a moment, because young students bear the important task of building a new order in East Asia, and to eliminate the evil influence of the United States and Britain in East Asia, the people of East Asia must endure all hardships and strive hard. Chinese young students are the future masters. We must not allow poor students who are unable to attend school to lose their education. Japan, which is closely related to China, expresses its concern about this situation. Now, Mr. Ayatsuhiko Ayatsu, residing in Kinnocho, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, has generously donated more than 10,000 yuan and entrusted it to us for transfer. According to Mr. Ayatsu's father, Mr. Koji Ayatsu, he was also one of the most sympathetic to the poor people of China in the past, a true friend of the Chinese people. This time, Mr. Ayatsuhiko Ayatsu generously donated a large sum to benefit the people. We hope that those who feel the same way will have a heart of compassion."</p>

<p>Brief Comment</p>
<h3>Friends of China Donate Funds for Education - The Righteous Deed of Mr. Takehiko Yoshizu</h3>
<p>The reader assistance fund of this newspaper has received contributions from all sectors of society in the past, especially this year. This proves that the positive significance of this initiative has been extremely approved by people from all walks of life. Yesterday, Mr. Takehiko Yoshizu, a Friend of China, remitted over 10,000 yuan from Tokyo, entrusting the Shanghai branch of the Asahi Shimbun to forward it to this newspaper. The main point of the original letter stated: "The young students of China are the masters of the future. How can we bear to let them drop out of school? Japan is closely related, and seeing this situation, we express our concern." Mr. Yoshizu's father was also a true friend of the Chinese people who sympathized with the poor in China. The main motive of this sincere enthusiasm is always to care for the future masters of China and not to let them drop out of school, expressing Japan's sympathy of sharing weal and woe. In addition to expressing our gratitude, this newspaper solemnly informs all young Chinese people that Mr. Yoshizu is the first to donate funds for education among friendly people, and we hope that more enthusiastic friendly people will follow suit and not let Mr. Yoshizu be the only one. At the same time, we hope that the young students who receive assistance will humbly accept the honor of being the future masters of China, study hard, and set this as their goal, in order to live up to the eager expectations of those who donate. We are also very grateful to Mr. Ryoichiro Kimura and Mr. Tocha Hirao, the heads of the Shanghai branch of the Asahi Shimbun, for promoting the reader assistance campaign of this newspaper in Japan, which has had a great impact. We also admire Mr. Hirao's kind assistance in expressing his opinion at the previous winter relief symposium convened by this newspaper, calling on friendly overseas Chinese to sympathize.</p>

<h3>Statement by Director Hirota of the Information Department</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office held a routine reception for the Chinese press corps of this city at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road yesterday (3rd) at 3:00 PM. More than ten reporters from various newspapers attended. From the embassy, Director Hirota of the Information Department, Trustee Guo Zongxian, and Mr. Mizoguchi Noboru were present. Lieutenant Kantei Tanaka of the Navy News Department also attended. First, Director Hirota of the Information Department made a statement, roughly saying that this time he returned to China to investigate the situation of the people in the country during the war, and he firmly believed that Japan would win the final victory in this Greater East Asia War. While I was in Tokyo, Roosevelt and Churchill of the United States and Britain held the so-called Roo-Chu Conference in Casablanca. The content was still that the United States and Britain stood on the same line, hoping to jointly resist the war against Japan, Germany, and Italy. And their so-called joint statement made people even more surprised. On the other hand, since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, it has repeatedly achieved unprecedented results, and the Japanese Navy has controlled the South Pacific and Solomon Islands, obtaining abundant resources. Recently, the Japanese Navy has quickly achieved unprecedented results in Solomon Islands, obtaining even greater victories. In short, this war is not simply a matter of purity. Therefore, our operations are based on the belief that we will never stop fighting until the final victory. China's participation in the war this time can further strengthen our beliefs and firm our will, and we will definitely win the final victory. Finally, we had a long discussion on important issues such as the National Government's order to implement the removal of the yellow symbols from the national flag on a regular basis and the recovery of the ancestral border, until 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Forgetting to Bring ID Card When Going Out – Fine of Five Yuan – Those with Damaged ID Cards – Fined Ten Yuan If Found</h3>
<p>Shanghai News reports that the authorities of the French Concession have recently found that many citizens do not wear their ID cards, or their ID cards are damaged, and many citizens have lost their ID cards and have not applied for replacement at the police station.

<h3>The Crowd Spending the Abolished New Year</h3>
<p>— Xu Yuzhang</p>
<p>The leisurely years of 1942 have passed like a wisp of smoke. The scene before us is clearly another "year's beginning" coming, and a brand new "New Year's Day," with all the appearance of a so-called "New Year" repeating and filling the streets, entertainment venues, and restaurants.</p>
<p>These days are the most active days for young people, especially in this bustling city. Whether in theaters, dance halls, dim sum shops, or the gambling dens that are the source of all evils, there are young people crowding everywhere. Even students and shopkeepers who usually lead a serious life will bring the money given to them by their parents or bosses to gamble. But they have all forgotten the country in distress, which is expecting them to have the spirit of perseverance and diligence to face the current crisis in the future.</p>
<p>Cigarettes costing hundreds of gold per box and oranges costing tens of gold each will be bought up by countless high-class Chinese people, either for meaningless consumption or to curry favor with dignitaries. Banquets costing thousands of gold are held, and lucky money packets containing hundreds of gold are given out, which is also common. Their luxurious habits have completely forgotten that the vast majority of compatriots are immersed in deep water and hot fire.</p>
<p>There are also groups of so-called "hidden poor" people who have no chance to get rich and no leisure days. They carry the burden of their high cost of living every day and make a final struggle on the hunger line. They don't know that "New Year" is enjoyable, they don't know what all the fun is about, they only know how to work hard and seek a bright path. (Move compensation to help education)</p>
<h3>Musings on New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>— Ru Ling</p>
<p>This year's New Year's Eve is different from previous years. With tight money supply, how many households can afford to eat their fill? In the midst of the urgent drumming of the New Year, the first thing that comes to my mind is collecting old debts. The business community regards the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and New Year's Eve as the three festivals, and collects debts according to the festivals, which is called the Three Festival Account. Before a festival passes, all night long, even after dawn, the roads are still crowded. Ordinary poor friends are forced to have no choice. The stupid ones seek death, and the smart ones evade debts. If not, there are still a few tattered cotton-padded jackets at home, which are taken to the Changsheng Pawnshop to pawn, to survive this remaining year with hunger and cold. Cai Tieweng's poem says: "There is no place to hide from the debt-collecting platform, debts accumulate throughout the year and are urged on one night, the shop door is closed to the pawnshop, and you still have to walk with a lantern." The so-called "Wang Xiaoer's New Year, is worse every year." The poor friends see that a certain mansion eats croaker dried fish costing one thousand yuan from Zhiweiguan, and buys a large vegetable plate costing seven hundred yuan from a certain company, and they still don't care. It is truly worth crying together. Huang Xingzhou's New Year's Eve poem says: "The first year is happy for the poor, and there has never been a debt collector." At this time and place, how many poor boys are not followed by debt collectors!</p>
<p>The ancient poems describing New Year's Eve mostly express more complaints than excitement. Bai Juyi's "Sick eyes sleep less, not keeping vigil, old heart feels more, facing spring again," and Song Zengqi's "New Year's wine gradually fades, homesickness is bitter, the night lamp faces, the traveler's sorrow is lonely," are either thinking of home in a foreign land, or suffering from poverty and old age. As for Huang Zhongze, the poet from Changzhou who thought that "scholars are useless"? But in "Accidental Two Poems on New Year's Eve of Gui Si," he complained a lot, saying: "I spend my time groaning this evening every year, the children laugh secretly in front of the lamp; How can you know that I regret myself, I wasted my energy to be a poet," although it is a feeling at the end of the pen, it reads with deep emotion. Alas, how sad is New Year's Eve under the pen of a scholar?</p>
<p>Winter ends and spring returns, the old goes and the new comes. The poor boy spends the New Year, and learns from Zheng Banqiao's two sentences: "White water in the bottle is offered to the ancestors, plum blossoms outside the window serve as breakfast."</p>
<h3>Fourth Place in Essay Contest - My Plan for This Year</h3>
<p>— Huang Wei</p>
<p>I am a teacher in a small school, and my job is to educate elementary school students. My plan for this year is how to educate this group of elementary school students.</p>
<p>As a woman, I am working as an elementary school teacher in a small town. I dare not consider myself a thoughtful person at the moment, and I dare not take the revival of education as my responsibility. Since I started teaching, three years have passed in an instant. The hardship of the life of an elementary school teacher in recent years is a well-known fact; however, I have finally stayed. Nothing else, just for the children. "Save our children!" I have personally taught and comforted the children for three years, how can I easily abandon them?</p>
<p>The days were crawling slowly, only my children can make me feel it flying. One year has passed, and another year has passed. What has passed is time, and what is left is the trace. Thinking deeply at night: only the death of the heart is the most sad, and only the numbness is the most hopeless. For the sake of the children, for the sake of the future of the children, how can I not be diligent and encourage myself? The following is my new plan for this year:</p>
<p>The first thing I want to do this year - that is, the first part of my plan - is to step up the physical training of the children. Look, although they are all eleven or twelve years old, they look like adults when they put on the big gowns. It's not that cold, but they put on cotton robes; this situation is really too inferior compared to the elementary school students in the East and the West.</p>
<p>We are used to seeing the weak physique of Chinese children in general. Regarding this mystery, some people say that the Chinese race is too weak! The twilight energy passed down for thousands of years has a tendency to accumulate too much to return. Indeed, how arduous is our responsibility for the physical training of children today!</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the intellectual education of children, I advocate that this year should be particularly innovated, that is, to read less dead books and to contact and recognize nature more. It is strange to say that although my small school is located in a rural social small city, because it is adjacent to Shanghai, it has been poisoned by modern urban civilization. Among the children, the vast majority do not recognize the five grains. I think this needs to be actively improved. The way to do this: reading a book on botany is not as good as letting them go to the countryside to learn how to farm once; drawing a map is not as good as traveling far away. Within the possible range, the intellectual training of children should try to replace the dead with the living, and replace the dull and boring books with lively and interesting knowledge and experiences. This is my suggestion.</p>
<p>The noise in the classroom is always like the buzzing of mosquitoes on a summer night, and it will never stop. The children are lovely, but they are so naughty. Just take the matter of private conversations in the classroom, the processing is troublesome enough. You can't pull a long face and shout loudly at them to listen quietly - this will make the children afraid of you, even hate you. If you think the children are afraid of you and hate you, can you still ask them to listen to you? If you don't listen to you, what do you teach? However, you can't just let them make trouble, just let them make trouble, what do you teach? Yes, teaching children is difficult, and to step up my training of them in the three aspects of awareness, physical education, and intellectual education this year, especially is it easy to talk about! Although, in order to ask for the perfection of the future results, we must not refuse the hard work of sowing today! (According to Ms. Huang, a native of Hai'ning, graduated from Beijing Normal University, and is currently a teacher at Xiashi Elementary School)</p>
<h3>The World's Teacher</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(1) (2)</p>
<p>"A good fellow, Rivers," Chips would always say when telling Mrs. Wickett this story for the twelfth time. "In class—er—not the most outstanding of boys. I remember he could never understand—er—verbs. And now—er—I saw in the papers they've made him—er—a baronet. That's really something—er—that's really something."</p>
<p>One morning in 1908, Sir John and Chips walked arm in arm around the deserted cricket field, and said, "Chips, old boy, I hear you've been having some arguments with Ralston. I was sorry to hear the news for your sake—but I want you to know that the governors are all with you. We don't like that fellow very much. Very clever, very capable, but a bit too clever, if you ask me. Through activities on the stock exchange, he's said to have doubled the school's funds. He may well have done it, but a young fellow like him needs watching. So, if he tries any more of his tricks on you, you can tell him very politely that he can clear off. The governors don't want you to resign. Brookfield wouldn't be the same without you, they know that. We all know that. You can stay here until you're a hundred, if you like—indeed, we hope you will."</p>
<p>Whether at that time or later, Chips could not continue whenever he recalled this point.</p>
<p>(12)</p>
<p>He thus remained at Brookfield, trying as much as possible to avoid contact with Ralston. In 1911, Ralston left his post, 'to better himself'; he was appointed headmaster of a larger public school. The man who succeeded him here was named Chatteris, whom Chips liked; he was even younger than Ralston had been then—thirty-four years old. Everyone said that he had a good reputation; in any case, he was modern (an honors graduate in natural science), kind, and sympathetic. He recognized Brookfield's traditions in Chips and he politely, intelligently, accepted the situation without taking offense. (30)</p>

<h3>Anti-Anglo-American Association Generously Donates to Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund</h3>
<p>Since its launch, the "Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund" initiated by this newspaper has received considerable support from all sectors of society. The fundraising goal is set at 200,000 yuan. First, Mr. Xu Guanqun generously donated 10,000 yuan worth of pharmaceuticals from the Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory, and our newspaper's colleagues donated 5,000 yuan from the saved spring banquet expenses. Yesterday, the Anti-Anglo-American Association donated 5,000 yuan (the association also contributed 5,000 yuan to this newspaper's Readers' Scholarship Fund), and Mr. Wu Qizhou generously donated 4,000 yuan, distributing rice porridge and benefiting poor teachers. Our newspaper colleagues are deeply grateful. In terms of funding, given time, it will not be difficult to achieve the expected goals. Therefore, relief work will be actively promoted. It is hoped that the authorities of various elementary schools in this city, together with the teaching staff, will provide the following reports as completely as possible and send them directly to this column.</p>
<p>(1) The number of teachers and staff in each elementary school, names, ages, genders, monthly salaries, and family size, and the monthly expenses of the entire family or individual.</p>
<p>(2) Health conditions in the last semester. (Such as the number of sick leaves per person per semester, ratios, types of illnesses suffered, amount of medical expenses paid, and how they were raised, etc.)</p>
<h3>Report on Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund</h3>
<p>Anti-Anglo-American Association: 5,000 yuan, Wu Qizhou: 4,000 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 9,000 yuan in savings certificates was received. Previous balance: 5,500 yuan, Current balance: 14,500 yuan.</p>
