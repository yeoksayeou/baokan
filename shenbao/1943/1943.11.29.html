<p>社評</p>
<h3>如何辦理冬賑</h3>
<p>本市勸募冬賑委員會於日前召開首次會議，推動勸募工作，以一千萬元為勸募標準，上海為工商業集中之區，殷富甚多，民情尤業善好施，一千萬元的數目，初非甚鉅。因此，我們所關心的倒不是賑　的能否募足，而是將來賑務如何辦理，　能使飢民確霑實忠，　不虛糜。</p>
<p>中國一個向來幾於無年不災，亦即無年不要辦賑的國家。經過去辦賑的情形而言，其中辦事絕對認眞；使辦款涓滴都用到災民身上的，固屬甚多；然而靠賑吃飯的亦不在少。此次徵募之標的，以數目簡論，固較　來為大；可是，就現在的購買力而言，却是微乎其微。我們主張，第一所有辦賑人員薪給以及辦公費用，均以　開支賑款為原則。第二所有施賑用的米　布棉，都應該請求配給機關，按照配給價格配給，不向黑市採購，因為黑市的價格固然是太高，尤其是毫無標準，不易稽考。</p>
<p>賑濟是社會福利工作的一部份，論理應該由社會福利機關主辦，不過此次科賑經費，旣非由政府籌撥，而由人民捐助，那末為示信於人民起見，所有施賑工作，最好還讓由民間各慈善團體聯合統一辦理，社會福利機關，處於監督指導地位。各慈善團體所有的辦事人員，所缺的是經費，辦理冬賑也是他們經常工作的一部份，往年因困於經費，無法大規模進行，現在拿現成的大批捐款委託他們去辦理，却是兩得其便，又可節省開支。不過，在委託的時候，對於各團體的內容以及平日辦事精神，似應加以嚴格審查。而監督方面。更須不厭周密，然後方免發生流弊，影響到這次冬賑的成績。至如辦公費用，固不可動用賑款，但亦不可責令各慈善機關賠塾，祇有請示公家擔負，這是公家的責任，也是公家的義務。</p>
<p>其次我們要提出的就是賑濟的範圍問題，以上海目前的情形而論，百分之五十以上的市民，都是忍飢受寒，有要求救濟的資格。然而博施濟衆，勢不可能。那末，祇有仍用向來辦賑的一句老話，就是「救死不救貧」，而祇限於街頭露宿飢寒無吿的一總價。我們覺得很可以利用此次辦理冬賑的機會，將此輩游民，施以收容，加以管理．因為如此辦理，不特便於　考，根本杜絕買濫重複，並且可以藉此整頓市容。倘能更進一步，將收容的游民，區別男女老弱少壯，把少壯的男丁，責令强迫服役，旣可免其坐食，養成游惰的習慣，亦可幫助市政建設，假使市政經費許可，待至明年春暖，將應該收養者，另行設院收養，應該工作者，設法給以工作，或資遣回鄕，對於游民的廓淸，市容的整肅，更可獲益不淺。果能如此做去，則此次辦理冬賑，對於社會不僅是一件消極的工作，而且是一件積極的工作。</p>
<p>游民之養成，不外兩途，其一是工商業停頓，使有業者變為失業。其二是社會環境不良，引誘人民墮落。我們固然極端擁護國家的物資統制政策，但是對於收買棉紗布以後，遲遲不實行配給，以致工商業停頓，因而造成無數失業者的現象，却認為不無遺憾。我們也希望市面繁榮，稅收增加，可是對於用煙窟賭塲來繁榮市面，增加稅收的方法，不能不說是害多利少。假使這種錯誤不根本糾正，無異一面提倡救濟。一面却盡力去製造賑濟的對象，誠恐明年今日，縱有十倍於今日的捐款，也無濟於事。</p>

<h3>上海盲啞學校（三）</h3>
<p>經費與前途</p>
<p>上海盲啞學校的經費，據稱經常費三十一年度決算　為五萬八千三百四十八元八角二分，一個月平均合四千八百六十二元四角。經常費三十二年度預算額爲九萬一千二百四十七元六角，平均每月爲七千六百○四元，臨時費三十二年度預算額為十六萬六千五百元，包括校舍及寄宿舍修築費在內。</p>
<p>固定的基金和經費是沒有的，只有這盤大院合可以利用。據稱地基面積四百六十六尺，建築面積四百十二方尺八，計所謂「一號館」三層，三百十六方尺八，「二號館」二層四十五方尺八，「三號館」一層二十方尺二。現在　以挹注的是一號館三樓房屋臨時分租金的收入，預定收入每月二千元。每年二萬四千元。現在大部分房間巳為幾戶日僑所租賃。</p>
<p>除了一部份分租金的收入之外，是學校附設「治療部」的收費，預定每月三千三百三十元，一年爲三萬九千九百六十元。合以上分租金，預定全年收入為六萬三千九百六十元，將來「治療部」發農，對於該校，可為發展盲啞軟育的重要因緊。除此之外，就只有學生繳納的學雜費了，不過不能算作主要經費了。</p>
<p>按照該校的計劃，是將一號館第一層加以改造，以一半作爲教室，一半作爲「治療部」，第二層改造後，分爲講堂，音樂敎室·校長室·職賽室·圖畫當等。第三層則於改築後仍作為臨時分租之用。現在一部分改造H作巳經着手過，不通每月七千餘元的經常開支尙有源泉枯竭之憂，鉅額的修築改造費自然更無所出，因此「一號館」第二層修築工和，除了四壁稍加粉飾以外．巳經無力繼續裝修工作了。這樣高大朗爽院舍，現在竟是這樣曠置着，眞是多麽可惜的事啊！（完）</p>

<p>雙方戰來</p>
<p>緊張異常，唯僑聯始終處於被動地位。尤以守將依凡諾夫屢救不可捉換之險球，而所失兩球亦莫名其妙。維克泰老將風範畢竟不凡，大虫法凡笑關煞，英雄無用武之地，聯誼高保正　辣作風制敵死命，為　得意傑作，費春華包辦二球，功不可沒，錢數鏞老矣衰矣，上塲十分鐘即告退休。阿初　將善戰，究為防守人才，祺祥較張林根穩健，蔡聲淼尙稱不惡，文奎心餘力拙，動作仍大方美觀</p>
<p>戰程開始</p>
<p>之初，聯誼賽春華高挑，球體角度甚佳，而　聯依凡諾夫得而復失，始告鵠中，成一對○，結束上半時。易地後，僑聯報仇心切，羣起反攻，李天生中途擒駕，撤退而退，卡洛列虛許而茲言一度探入腹地，幸越位有人，無功而返，距終塲三分鐘費春華獲俞振岳之援助，兩人一球，聯誼終以二對○勝僑聯。</p>

<h3>上週金融　無顯著變動</h3>
<p>百物售價仍穩定</p>
<p>滬市金融與工商市况上週間依然穩定如常，間有少數物品因去路激增，持貨者居奇，因此售價稍被抬高，但均被當局人員查覺，依法懲處，或予停業，或予罰款示做，統計全週間約達十餘起之多。至於食糧一項，因來源多寡，及去　增減不定，售價亦軒　不一，但共中以棉毛織品漲勢較熾，究諸　結所在，乃係質者理接所致。至於金融狀况，關金給赤紋銀等公定市價仍無變化，拆息始終掛一角七分未更，然銀根仍甚緊張，各業頭寸之調度不無困難，幸中儲富局調度有方，尙無不幸事件發生。</p>
<h3>商統會工作進入　第二階段之各種問題</h3>
<p>商統會自成立以來，實施物資統制，從事確立中國經濟之自主的統制經濟，應付周圍急速的事態之發展，正在逐步推進之中，關於商統會本身業務今後是否探取高度運營之新方策，頗為各方所注自。茲提示具體實行之各種問題，作一概觀。</p>
<p>成立迄今之經過</p>
<p>商統會成立之最大目的，為大東亞戰爭下逮成中國經濟之使命，推進國府典民族資本之合作及中　之經濟提携二點。因此以財界有力者為理監事，而從事於　物資統買，配給，　國內各地區物資交流之運營，　輸出物資之供給，　輸入物資之配給，　政府委託定物資之採辦，　實業部及其他主管部指定委託事項之處理。觀察其工作經過狀況，該會之事務機構及各重要物資專業委員會，於六月完成．又下層機構之各業聯合會，亦於七月上句一會，亦於漢口，廣東，南京等處設立，不過最近一，批評之核心，有以下之三點：　商統會本身之缺陷，　經濟人協力不充分,　商統會與各關係當局之關係。茲分述此三點實情於後：</p>
<p>商統會本身之缺陷</p>
<p>第一問題，商統會之物資統制工作，從自由經濟急轉於就制經濟，巳有多時，吾人假使眞能理解中國經濟之現階段之情況，那末大家必能認識實施統制經濟的困難了。至於機構的　備，在中途担任收買棉紗布工作，一面又注重於確立重要物資之統買機構，因此一般人批評商統會偏重於機構方面，沒有考慮到顯著中國經濟機構與統制經濟可能性等。間時其工作不僅是經濟工作，常連帶到政治，關於此點，尤應特別注意。（　自大　新報）（未完）</p>

<h3>南太平洋戰局的展望</h3>
<p>敵人自從十月二十七日登陸摩諾島以來，七次出動大艦隊及運輸船團，企圖奪回波根維　島及新不列殿島不斷前來强口，欲決一死戰，而一舉覆減甘本的南方戰略要點。由於B本海軍機並水上艦艇的奮鬥，及作戰首關部之極巧妙的戰略，遭戰史上空前的大敗，擊沈擊毀戰艦六艘，空母八艘，及巡洋艦，　　艦，運輸船等合計八十五艘。這在他們此方面的新攻勢上，是極大的打擊，且敵人付出了這樣大的損害，依然毫無所得。他們從這莫大的犧牲中所換得的波根維爾島特洛基那岬的登陸，大事宣傳說巳經達到了所期目的，而掩飾敗續。且今後此方面的戰鬥，亦將不能如他們所顧而順利進展，此由於他們所巳遭遇的敗總及以前密林戰的經戰判斷起來也可以明瞭。在敵方，戰鬥愈長期化，則輿論將愈囂然宣傳敗戰的眞相。於此，他們一面焦慮地想使波根維兩島的戰况有利，一面擬在新戰塲上求得新的戰果。換句話說，他們用新戰切以韓移目光，企圓分散所羅門方面的日本航空，水上各部隊的兵力，想在所羅門北上作戰上打出一條活路。那麽敵方今後想在驟方面出擊呢？從敵方兵力的特質及以前的載略看時，顯然必將在中部太平洋蠢動。茲試從敵方的建艦並出擊狀况，檢討其新的計劃。</p>
<p>活用航空兵力</p>
<p>敵方自從開戰後約半載，即已喪失了戰前所保存的航空母艦之大部份，而現在他們所採用的戰術則是活用大量航空兵力。因此，必須多數的陸上基量航空兵力的基地，祗有術次術次直把直把到基到基倍地倍地拉向拉向作戰時止，既不要航空母艦，也毋須大艦隊。然而敵人在另－方面則積極專事建造航空母艦，自從南太平洋海戰中喪失了大部分的殘存航空母艦之後，不過一年，敵人重又有很多的航空母艦就役，完成了船員的訓練。於是以這航空母艦為中心的機動部隊，進行從所羅門北上的跳島作戰，而遇到日軍從波根維爾島至新不列顛島所佈置下的有力防綫。他們在所羅門，新機內亞方面所預備的基地航空兵力，在這裏感到不足。可是他們仍强　日軍的航空基地，費了極大的消耗，雖能制壓甘軍的波根維爾島基地蒲印，巴賴雷等地，但卒不能完全制新不列顛島拉蒲爾基地。這大戰中補充不能抵過消耗。他們出動裝着汽油，彈藥及載有百架飛機的航空母艦，並配以戰艦及其他許多水上艦艇的太繙隊，欲一舉殲減日軍的航空兵及水上艦隊，然後悠然登陸。但由於日軍海軍機，水上艦艇之智謀勇敢，而至於受挫。</p>
<p>敵方艦隊擊滅</p>
<p>如是，哈羅塞的西南太平洋艦隊完成變成貧乏艦隊，擊減日軍水上艦艇及航空母艦，固然未曾如願以償，而欲增援並補充特洛基那岬登陸軍隊，亦極困難。他們所呼號的一鼓而下拉蒲爾的企圖，變成了他們所不喜歡的長期化狀態，而國內與論亦不容把敗總長此掩飾過去。至此，他們乃似乎決計想分散日軍兵力，以打開此方面的戰局。這是他們所稱的尼密資攻擊。尙　在的尼密資曾說過擬用太平洋艦隊出擊，以牽制日本艦隊並航空兵力。當本月十日美海軍創設六十八周年紀念時，他曾聲稱：</p>
<p>「美圃不久即將對日軍展開大攻勢，紛碎其島　要塞。美國將用單　直入的方法實施此次作戰」</p>
<p>至十八日又說：「日本軍不能不覺悟中部太平洋戰局的大攻勢快要到來。我們要制壓馬　　，吉　伯二羣島，使美軍登陸是絕對必要的。」這可以看作他將在中部太平洋作戰的證明。不過我們在這裏所應該者慮的。　次顯然不像前次以空母為中心前來襲學南鳥島及大鳥島的機動部隊之空襲，而　即撤離的暫時的率制。他曾說一定要登陸，由此可知並不是暫時的牽制的企圖．但因此方面島　林立且均爲珊瑚　的小島，不能展開他們觀大航空兵力。所以此方面敵人的蠢動，以空母為主機的動部隊之活動成為中心。他們所最希望的制空權下的艦隊決戰，不待說，有着很大的限制。敵　隊的出擊，正是日軍所希望的．卽使是在有力的基地航空部隊之掩護下，前來出擊的哈羅　艦隊，也被殺得片甲不留。在日本艦隊之前，尼密寳艦隊也將　哈羅　艦隊之覆撤吧！（翔：譯自十一月二十二日四部　日新聞）</p>
<h3>突破黑暗的天險　南太平洋血戰紀實</h3>
<p>惡　般的黑山峰，重重疊疊，無底的山谷似死一樣沈靜。濃霧般凄淸的牛毛爾，滴在　兜上的雨，沁入骨髓。在熱帶的寒季，渾身哆嗦着的兵士們的臉上，浮着一層灰色•這一重重的山，乃是直走新幾內亞之背的史丹萊大山脈。這用天險的門固閉起來的黑暗世界之日軍某部隊，在這山岳戰中，漬散澳軍，終於突破〇〇而加以占領。將士們的一切官能，都凝集在擊減敵人的鬥魂中了。</p>
<p>七天的時間，似夢般過去了，嚙着筍一般的榮蘭芽，像山羊般啃着草葉，可是也不覺得　餓。到〇〇去！望下看。遠遠的那面黑暗中，際隱約約地有二，三蓋燈，發出似針般銳利的光。在那夷1去殺掉他們！</p>
<p>食糧沒有了，差一部分士兵，到後方去，但等他們帶糧秣回來，還要很多天。</p>
<p>「好！到那裏去新殺，一同死吧！」</p>
<p>在這種地方，與其餓死，不如和他們拚了吧。某隊長下了這決心後，挽起白抹額，將士們也都1同準備起來。</p>
<p>「我們一同死！」</p>
<p>某隊長握着日本刀，眼睛閃閃地發着光。</p>
<p>「好！」</p>
<p>爲國犧牲</p>
<p>破裂空氣般尖銳的聲音。現在是為國家　呈我們的生命的時候了。</p>
<p>突擊那　有燈光的敵陣，然後囘到靖國神社去吧1從心底湧起一陣衝動，熱汗從面頰上流下。</p>
<p>遙拜了宮城的敢死隊，合唱着「大海行」，盡壯的歌聲威嚇敵軍似地透進了密林，這是〇月〇日的夜裏，出發襲擊敵陣的日本神兵之姿。</p>
<p>我在〇〇基地歡送〇〇都部隊，是〇月初。那是怎樣的情形呢？</p>
<p>在〇天之內，於敵機羣襲之下，在新幾內亞鳥北岸完成了敵前上陸。不久，我在運輸船上從參謀那裏獲得下面的情報．。</p>
<p>「〇〇部隊主力巳於史丹萊山脈附近占領陣地，正準備對敵攻擊中，定於〇〇日開始攻擊。」</p>
<p>的確快哪！神速的通擊。</p>
<p>敵軍為了死守新幾內亞和近在咫尺的澳洲，鞏固着南北的海岸綫。洋上也有强力的機動艦隊。可是，這支艦隊却被日本海軍部隊捉住，全部化為海底為藻層了．那就是有名的珊瑚海海戰。</p>
<p>「野獸都不能棲息的史丹萊山脈，甘軍豈能突破麽？」敵軍以他們自己的戰鬥能力為基準，這樣妄自斷定。可是，對於日軍，是無所謂不可能的。史丹萊山脈哪？……祇要看日軍士兵的意氣就得！鬥魂呀！一切都是鬥魂呀</p>
<p>日本的精銳部隊陸續登岸。沿海一帶，一片　林，綿廷不絕。在星空下速步疾走的影子，衝過椰林，躍上正道。乓乓，槍聲起了。敵機來啦，開始亂炸了。起卸完畢的〇售運輸船，業巳消失它們的姿態於洋上。祇有一艘尙在起卸最後的物件。　，　，達，　！　　　下．落下一枚炸彈。畜生！船員，兵士，裕着火在，　　作業。砂袋齊飛，水流直嘖，撲向火焰之中。久　訓練的人員，沈着從事減火作業。同時，在這間　不容之時，起重　仍嘎嘎地不住活動．甲根巳化為火海了．﹁起卸完．1」一等運韓士高聲喊道。小艇向岸疾駛。被　所吹一，偏向一邊。敵機是去了．沒有炸彈了吧。看啊．山峰那邊有紅燈綠燈下來了！是敵機哩！又來了。</p>
<p>雨中行軍</p>
<p>這時，確保上陸點後，部隊即向正路前進。道路憲外地好，先行的橫山工兵隊巳將路面　補加强了。可是，一下雨，路又變成泥濘了。「好厲害的雨哪！」兵士說着天空笑。橫這亂打似的大雨哪！這樣一直到〇〇止，我們的敵人就祇是雨。嘩啦嘩啦地，隊伍在「水溝」中行。突然雨　，露出了澄碧的靑天。鐵兜如的，兵士的肩　着白氣。</p>
<p>從海岸敗退的敵兵，以咯咯達為最後的抵抗據點，正從摩勒斯比港用大型飛機拼命輸送軍隊，彈藥和糧秣。友軍機雖這來追去地攻打，他們仍是繼續補充。日軍的銳鋒着着向敵方據點推進。好像熱病患者的體溫表，戰綫刻刻上升。</p>
<p>距離海岸業巳〇〇分里。這裏巳是一望坦蕩的平陽。到處都有椰子的巢實。還發見了萬夀瓜。稍息時，因為在乾了的土上熱辣辣地走了過來，所以甜的椰子汁是不合口味的，反不如萬瓜夀來得可口。擘開長　圓形的太瓜，一股熱帶的香氣撲　，黃褐色的厚肉，咬上一口，直夠味兒。好美盛的一餐哪！</p>
<p>走入　山　．給　　益困難，而且山中又找不到糧食，身邊所帶的米非盡量省不可。將士和　火奮鬥着。</p>
<p>過了　希　附近的平原後，地勢一步一步　高。每日總得遭遇三次以上的傾盆大雨，軍靴上邊滿了粘土，滑　地走着。隊伍停停動動，動動停停。士兵們的脊背和鼻子常常有效碰在一起。雨打之後又是日晒，日晒之後再是雨淋。每日都是這樣的情形，所以行車之足稍停，全身便似浴化般　　。據着重火器的士兵，老是　着重劇「立着」休息。「爲什麼不卸下來？」不用問卸下來之後，他們將沒有力氣再扛上肩去了。那些士兵們，稍稍俯着頭，默默無言地兀立着。廣闊的肩　，看似堅固的岩石。交伐搬送時，也是由此　移向那肝，除出夜晚宿　以外，總是肩着重荷。</p>
<p>可喜的是在這一段行程中，有許多河流。像日本內地的河流一樣澄澈的淸溪，不知有幾條，撗橋於平原上。夜裏宿　時。在淸溪中沐浴，其樂無窮。但不知怎樣，洗了澡的士兵身上，都發奇妙的疹子，每逢行軍流汗時，便奇癢難熱。</p>
<p>從奧伊比走入山地，陡斜的坡路和　　山腹的烏道，相連互接。工兵隊伐木開山，拓成了〇公尺的道路。遇山谷，則架獨木僑；逢急城，則張藤蔓索。敵方的飛機每日飛來，但都飛越我們的頭頂，向海岸方面反攻。成爲敵軍據點的咯咯達，是在史丹萊山脈下的高原地帶，築有飛行塲，對於敵軍，乃是山脈陣地的心臟。（吉：譯自每日新聞）</p>

<h3>秋夜</h3>
<p>— 張惠南</p>
<p>季節中我最愛的是秋天，凉　的風，　　的天空，活　的島，　田地飛　在蔚藍的　布申，我稱秋爲自由的季節，就是取這個用徵。</p>
<p>我愛春的朝氣，夏的豔麗，冬的嚴肅，可是我更愛秋的靜　。</p>
<p>的落葉，是時代的廢物；光禿的枝幹，顧出事實底眞實。</p>
<p>秋之夜！是靜靜的，我似有意地穿了較單薄的衣服，獨個兒徘徊在錚陰的街梢。凉風吹着我，月光撫拍我，我感到凉了：精神上是無限的甜蜜和恬靜，而我還是有意地徘徊在靜的，凉的、秋之街梢。這是有意的徘徊、並非彷徨．直到月光　滿了我的全身，　餐了是兒食情的光芒，在意識上，我猶似洗了個水銀浴。受了夜風一陣　一陣的催促，於是，我才留　地暫時告別了。</p>
<p>朋友，你有過夜　？你有注意過夜嗎？尤其是恬靜的深秋之夜。</p>
<p>世上最美的就是靜夜，尤其是　天的，不論獨個兒幻想也宜，典朋友暢叙衷腸也罷，總之，夜靜的時候，是最適于人的。</p>
<p>仰起頭，遇見天暮上疏落的　星，1閃一爍地，像是孤獨的戀人的眼睛，對着你深深地，悲哀又似甜蜜地微笑。</p>
<p>當飄著沁人腦肺的凉风的靜夜，正是最合沉思的。幻想到未來的歡樂，儘可發聲等著，　及過去底　傷，盡可舒暢地流淚。此時有凉風吹乾你的　珠，有月光慰撫你的心胸，寒戲吐出憂　的發光，與你的心胸其嗚，決沒有東四——假使是人的話——來取笑你的情感．這便是夜的神祕，也就是夜的偉大！</p>
<p>可惜我不是畫家不能把含情的星星，　它幾朶，我又不是文家，更不是詩人，所以不能用絢麗的詞藻，來寫出這藏着美之眞諦的——靜靜的秩夜。</p>
<h3>歌</h3>
<p>— 胡若流</p>
<p>我愛歌，也數喜唱歌，尤其是激昂雄壯，使精神煥發的歌。</p>
<p>大概是天性剛强的緣故，我是喜歡唱雄壯的歌曲。尤其是在寂寞的時候，或者是在月白　淸之夜，一個人提高喉　唱着雄壯的歌曲，是多麽有趣味，有意義的呀！</p>
<p>歌，我相信是煥發精呀神的，記得世界有名的「馬賽進行曲」，它就喚起頹廢消沉的法蘭四兵獲得了勝利。</p>
<p>我愛「馬賽行曲」，我更愛我們中國的許多激昂雄壯的歌曲。</p>
<p>雖然我流淚到上海來以後，不能再唱雄壯的高歌，這使我內心是感覺非常　過的。特別是對面的幾位小姐，她們也是喜歡唱歌的，但她們所唱的却是柔美而消沉意志的歌曲，「愛的波折」「書　處處開」「夢中人」……使我聽了就覺得頭痛。</p>
<p>現在，我正塲握緊　在寫的時候，她們的歌聲又送來了，那嬝嬝的，婉轉的麻　歌曲，一字一旬都覺得難受。於是，我就提高喉嚨唱——</p>
<p>怒髪冲冠，憑攔時，瀟瀟雨　，抬望眼，仰天長嘯，壯懷激烈……</p>
<p>我這激昂的歌曲唱出後，那嬝娜麻醉的歌曲就聽不見了。</p>
<h3>無題</h3>
<p>— 言式之</p>
<p>今天—</p>
<p>不是我歌唱的日子。</p>
<p>我的喉音變成嘶啞；我的唇舌已經辛　；</p>
<p>祗有一把火在我胸中，燃燒起憤怒。</p>
<p>可是，我又將　下肚的淚水，來澆滅它。</p>
<p>因為我知道，憤怒是沒用的。</p>
<p>我要認淸，毀了她底靑春的劊子手，是怎樣的，猙獰，殘酷。</p>
<p>我要用我的，武器：七首，投槍，去和它戰鬥</p>
<p>直到我們完全勝利的時候。</p>
<p>今天—</p>
<p>不是我歌唱的日子，</p>
<p>明天！</p>
<p>却是我們，高唱凱旋的時候。</p>
<p>當勝利跟着，</p>
<p>明天的太陽同時昇起</p>
<p>我們的歌聲，</p>
<p>將響澈在四週！</p>

<p>— 叔𤲅</p>
<p>我起身了，</p>
<p>天還沒有破曉；</p>
<p>收拾了地舖，</p>
<p>急忙地揩抹打掃；</p>
<p>煤爐還暗着，</p>
<p>正等我生火燃燒，</p>
<p>一陣濃烟，</p>
<p>悶辣得珠淚紛拋！</p>
<p>雖然是暴燥，</p>
<p>但又不能不生好。</p>
<p>門外碌碌地車聲來了，</p>
<p>我習慣地——</p>
<p>拎起了廣漆的馬桶，</p>
<p>跑向門外去倒，</p>
<p>街頭還是凄凉的，</p>
<p>晚風正如那銳利的尖刀！</p>
<p>那推車的老兒，</p>
<p>照例微笑地說聲「早」！</p>
<p>匆匆地跑囘來，</p>
<p>樓上巳在喊叫，</p>
<p>是老板娘的呼聲；</p>

<p>——侍候地洗淖。</p>
<p>排門開了，</p>
<p>那時光還早，</p>
<p>生意是冷落的；</p>
<p>於是：</p>
<p>又背着竹籃，</p>
<p>跟隨那師母小菜塲跑。</p>
<p>囘來，是獨個洗淖，</p>
<p>慢慢地市面上塲了，</p>
<p>我便　成伙計！</p>
<p>店堂中穿梭似地，</p>
<p>忙得透不過氣來，</p>
<p>老板規袖手旁戳的，</p>
<p>只是微微地笑；</p>
<p>職業·掙錢·出路……</p>
<p>學徒·伙計。　人……</p>
<p>勾起了我雜亂的思潮，</p>
<p>我茫然地，</p>
<p>——立在店堂中，</p>
<p>是痴呆了，</p>
<p>拍的一個耳光！</p>
<p>「小鬼！你倒會　死」！</p>

<p>把我按奈住了；</p>
<p>我末末地忍受，</p>
<p>但覺得臉上發燒！</p>

<h3>西靑籃球第一週　東方隊揚眉吐氣</h3>
<p>濟濟多士：克服西人聯軍　仁餘敗矣：華影奮發有為</p>
<p>西靑籃球聯賽巳於上　一（十一月二十二甘）揭開戰幕。靜安道上，球迷如　，籃球房內，　聲　天，此次比賽，每星期一三五計有甲組二塲，乙組二塲，二四六則僅乙組一傷。上週中北對東方，原定二十六日逐角，惜固中北改期。一塲南北大戰，恐將留作　柚大觀。茲略述第一週甲組戰况如后：</p>
<p>第一晚（廿二日）</p>
<p>華影勝業餘　業餘擁有紅隊之陶紹生。胡孝光，百樂門之　幼良，周智，王文極，等一般老將。華影陣容，較遜一籌。賽前多謂業餘必勝，而記者則早預料華影可以告　，此非記者好作過後之言，藍籃球比賽最重聯絡，業餘　卒成軍，不無有鳥合之　。華影在錢旭滄諄諄指導之下，竿頭日上，傳遞純熱，而諸將尤皆勝算可操，其理甚明。結果終以三十二—二十八力挫强敵。華影高茫生任亞偉　出特佳，劉瓊籃下截球，頗有獨到之處，氣似不夠．舒適富有苦幹精神，殊見賣力，業餘幼良紹止技術固佳，第以不能知彼知己，全隊呵成一氣，　吿敗挫！</p>
<p>同仁勝大華　是役也，同仁演出，並不如理想之純熟，攻既散漫，守亦鬆懈；大華可勝未勝，共原因全在火氣太旺。犯規累累，且某球員因猛撞同宣通之　部，致被罰出（是時大華佔先）乃以四人應戰，寡不敵衆，乃必然之趨勢。深望該隊員知所改過，多加涵養功夫，有厚望　焉！</p>
<p>第二夜（廿四日）</p>
<p>華南勝三輸　三輸均係老將，不無　　之感。筆南則皆年富力壯，正欣欣尙榮之秋，而演出却勢均力敵。其理由無他，華南以健將劉福基缺席、再則亦微存輕敵之念，驕兵必敗，其不敗巳屬意外大幸。三輸雖老將，尙肯振作精神。發　有為，　　樁又稱努力。常日情形，頗有取勝可能，結果雖以四四—四九小挫，可以無愧矣！</p>
<p>汕隊勝仁餘　　戲可稱為仁餘之門徒，均料汕隊必敗，詎意此戰　大出冷門，靑出於藍，而勝於藍，喧　一時之仁餘隊乃為其一手訓練之門徒所屈服，允為本屆西靑籃球賽第一次冷門。油隊之優點，或在氣勝，仁餘之敗，終覺令人莫解，要亦手下留情，抑有其他原因，則非我人所能知。結果三十八—二十八，相差亦達五球之多，亦云奇矣！</p>
<p>第三夜（廿六日）</p>
<p>第一塲翼隊不見，由巨人出戰蒙諾克，此二西隊之戰術，如出一轍，故經過相當緊奏、分數異常難得和接近，巨人　　密洛夫及浮尼克之遠射有效，以十九—十一獲勝。</p>
<p>第二傷本為中北，東方之戰，雙方各擁名將，勝利誰屬，自為球迷所急欲一覘者，故是夜室內擁得水淺不道，乃第一次之盛况，比以中北主将李　中傷足，請求改期，臨時改由東方出戰西人聯軍，一塲友誼賽，殺得難解難分，精彩絕倫。東方以百　門為班底，益以包松園，張嘉　，高保生，李祖德，部本生，濟濟多士，此戰採用車輪戰，要為日後全隊聯絡之張本，西聯由　諾克，巨人，　隊相　廳戰。乃以征甲甫卸。再整我裝，不免勞頓，東方以　待勞，結果三十八—三十五小勝四聯軍。</p>
<p>勗勉東方</p>
<p>觀夫西靑局勢，華人三巨頭，東方，中北。仁餘三隊，其中仁餘不幸出軍不利已敗一次，銳氣大挫，總屬吃虧。為我華　　眉吐氣者，隊惟來方，中北二強矣，東方前夕露臉之後，記者有所論列，聊作　　之獻。</p>
<p>按東方可以臨戰大敵之將；計為陸鐘恩，包松園，王鏡瑚，張少卿，許文　，高保生，張嘉　，錢敬　等。馮念華常有傷都本生尙在訓練其臨敵時理智時期，暫亦不能應付大敵。</p>
<p>東方之戰術，雖採用人釘人，其實許文　太　，張少卿喜竄，用人釘人，此二人必有漏洞。故如用人釘人出戰時，必須用陸　恩張　　，包松讓，高保生，王　　。此五虎將，奔　迅速，力亦充怖。自能釘得本人。　得分將全恃乎王　　及無大把　之包松　，高保生三人而巳，若用五人聯防法時則出傷者應為包松園，陸鐘恩，張少卿，許文奄，王鏡瑚。此陣綫原為百樂門之全班，一向亦採用人釘人。唯記者　覺用人釘人戰術，如有一人　　必無伴免，許文平既不　釘人。張少卿有過度不及之嘆，故如上述陣容，深以為可採用五人　防法，則彼此　默巳久，或能天衣無縫盡如人意也，况煎鋒俱為投　之好手，獲分必多。（梅必　）</p>
<h3>足球聯賽甲組　三強隊唱凱歌</h3>
<p>一警大隊不可一世聯誼東華各贏二球</p>
<p>足球聯賽，上週三　足之一警·聯誼。東華，先後克敵致果，晋上一級，依然保存對時三　局面。</p>
<p>一警不可一世</p>
<p>上週六鬥猶本於膠州公園，看客不多，以為勝　早判，何足一觀，實則一警則表演神技，小黃毛之衝，兩翼之飛，全隊似膠似漆，確應為眞眞球迷所欣賞，配者殊　意一　之演出，異至最後十五分，兩隊均見粗暴，如演全武行，不無抉　，所幸者未擴大耳。一警，　田於上半時有意傷人，被罰出。一警始終以十人應戰，猶太竟不能以衆勝寡，共技術之差一籌也，結果四比一，小黃毛又三元連中，神乎其速，允為我華隊心　之患危險人物。</p>
<p>聯誼力取僑聯</p>
<p>昨日（二十八日）上午逸園傷上人　狂熱。聯誼以李義臣之依然隱豹，陣容與戰三省同，唯左翼兪振岳一人出塲而已，昨賽之後，聯誼守强攻弱，巳成鐵證。李天生吳祺祥地位之佳，脚頭之妙，無出其右。前鋒非聯絡無方，實欠脚頭。除許文奎有幾記球之外，高保生費春華均嫌太弱。　永福野球太多，愈振岳不足論矣。</p>
<p>僑聯演出尙佳，許而茲以　振岳之無用，兼管瞿永福，殊見得體。異乎致前錄因法凡笑被看住，以致前路一　莫展，無法　攻。聯誼上半時費春華獲一球，下半時高保生衛一　，乃以二對〇小勝僑聯，同樣晉升一格。</p>
<p>三省威脅東華</p>
<p>昨日下午天微雨，陰沉沉球迷掃興，膠州間中，景象慘慘，衆料東華不可輕描淡寫，直搗黃龍，豈知三省小將，一變面目，幾造成和局之局面，始眞適合初生之　不畏虎之語矣。東華以勝利穩操，　福楨　手旁觀，林根坐鎭中原，重心巳動搖，再以　世明任右前衛，自難前呼後應矣。然昨賽三省球運亦殊亭通，東華攻門為高致文救出之球，有半打以上之多。若果正常以前，殿軍一席，可以護　，昨賽始終在緊張過程中，至終了前十五分鐘東華僅以三對二小勝。且三省攻勢汹汹，大有再破一關，造成和局之雄心，終以力稍差，未能如願以償，反為韓龍海偷渡攻入，東華再以四對二，積分表上，加添二分。（潔）</p>

        <h1>1943.11.29</h1>
<h3>How to Handle Winter Relief</h3>
<p>The Municipal Winter Relief Fundraising Committee convened its first meeting a few days ago to promote fundraising efforts, with a target of 10 million yuan. Shanghai, being a concentrated area of industry and commerce with many wealthy individuals, and its people known for their charitable inclinations, this sum of 10 million yuan is not, in fact, very large. Therefore, our concern is not whether the relief funds can be fully raised, but rather how the relief work will be carried out in the future, so that the famine victims can truly receive substantial benefits and not be exploited.</p>
<p>China has almost always been a country with constant disasters, meaning that relief efforts are needed every year. Looking at past relief efforts, many have been absolutely earnest in their work, ensuring that every penny of the funds reaches the disaster victims. However, there are also not a few who live off of the relief. This time, the fundraising target, in terms of numbers, is indeed larger than in the past. However, in terms of current purchasing power, it is negligible. We propose that, firstly, all salaries of relief personnel and office expenses should not be paid from the relief funds. Secondly, all rice, cloth, and cotton used for relief distribution should be requested from the allocation agencies at the allocation price, and not purchased on the black market, because black market prices are not only too high, but also lack standards and are difficult to audit.</p>
<p>Relief is a part of social welfare work, and in principle should be organized by social welfare agencies. However, since the relief funds are not allocated by the government this time, but rather donated by the people, then, to demonstrate credibility to the people, it is best to have all relief work jointly and uniformly carried out by various non-governmental charitable organizations, with social welfare agencies acting in a supervisory and guiding role. What the staff of various charitable organizations lack is funding. Handling winter relief is also a part of their regular work. In the past, they were unable to carry it out on a large scale due to a lack of funds. Now, entrusting them with a large amount of donations would be a win-win situation and would save on expenses. However, when entrusting them, the internal workings and the usual work ethic of each organization should be strictly reviewed. And the supervision aspect must be meticulously thorough, so as to avoid corruption and affect the success of this winter relief effort. As for office expenses, while they should not be taken from the relief funds, nor should the charitable organizations be forced to cover them. Instead, the public sector should be asked to bear them, as this is the responsibility and obligation of the public sector.</p>
<p>Next, we want to raise the issue of the scope of relief. Considering the current situation in Shanghai, more than 50 percent of the citizens are enduring hunger and cold and are eligible for relief. However, it is impossible to provide relief to everyone. In that case, we can only use the old saying of past relief efforts, which is "rescue the dying, not the poor," and limit it to the homeless on the streets who are suffering from hunger and cold. We feel that we can take advantage of this winter relief opportunity to shelter and manage these vagrants. Because doing so would not only facilitate auditing, fundamentally eliminate duplicate claims and abuse, but also help to clean up the city's appearance. If we can go a step further, and classify the sheltered vagrants by gender, age, and physical strength, and require the young and strong men to perform compulsory labor, we can not only prevent them from eating without working and developing a habit of idleness, but also help with municipal construction. If municipal funding permits, and by next spring when the weather warms up, those who should be taken care of can be placed in separate shelters, and those who should work can be given jobs or repatriated to their hometowns, which would greatly benefit the elimination of vagrants and the improvement of the city's appearance. If we can do this, then this winter relief effort will not only be a passive undertaking for society, but also an active one.</p>
<p>The formation of vagrants is due to two reasons: one is the stagnation of industry and commerce, which turns employed people into unemployed; the other is the poor social environment, which tempts people to become degenerate. While we strongly support the nation's material control policy, we regret the fact that after purchasing cotton yarn and cloth, the delay in implementing allocations has led to the stagnation of industry and commerce, thereby creating countless unemployed people. We also hope that the market will be prosperous and tax revenues will increase, but we cannot help but say that using opium dens and gambling houses to prosper the market and increase tax revenues does more harm than good. If these errors are not fundamentally corrected, it is tantamount to promoting relief on one hand, while trying to create objects for relief on the other. I fear that next year, even with ten times the donations of today, it will not be enough.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Air Force Achieves Great Victory in the Skies Over Rangoon, Intercepts Attacking Enemy Aircraft and Destroys Fourteen of Them</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a forward base of the Japanese Army in Burma: On the Burmese front, Japanese Army aircraft intercepted attacking enemy aircraft over Rangoon on the afternoon of the 27th. After a fierce dogfight, they shot down four Common Wealth (BAU24) aircraft and seven North American Mustang (PAU51) aircraft, which are touted as the fastest in the world, as well as three Lockheed (PAU38) aircraft, totaling fourteen. The large formation of enemy aircraft attacking Japan gained nothing and only provided targets for Japanese aircraft. The Japanese side also suffered damage to three aircraft, one of whose pilots parachuted to safety.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Conduct Two Fierce Attacks on Enemy Positions on Bougainville Island</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base in the South Pacific: Naval Air Forces attacked enemy positions at the mouth of the Torokina River on Mono Island and Bougainville Island twice, at dawn and at night on the 26th, dropping bombs and hitting their military installations. A large fire broke out during the first bombing raid. The results of the second raid could not be determined due to the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain Japanese Army base in the South Pacific, dated the 28th: A joint squadron of 96 enemy fighter-bombers attacked Buin on Bougainville Island on the 22nd. Japanese ground forces immediately launched a fierce counterattack, shooting down 20 of them. A squadron of 100 enemy fighter-bombers attacked the area again on the 26th and were again shot down by Japanese ground forces, with only minor damage to the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Bomb Yu Army on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Line</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain forward base of the Japanese Army in Central China: Japanese Army aircraft have been actively cooperating with Japanese ground forces on the Jiangnan front in recent days, making numerous sorties and fiercely bombing Yu troops moving north from Tongxi (10 kilometers southeast of Shanzhou), Tongcheng (50 kilometers south of Puqi), and Guikoushi (30 kilometers south of Yuqi) on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway line on the morning of the 27th, dropping bombs and completely crushing their attempts to advance.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain forward base of the Japanese Army in Central China: Japanese Army aircraft have repeatedly launched joint combat-bombing raids on Changde, which is about to fall. The raid at 1:50 PM on the 27th was particularly fierce. On that day, Japanese aircraft bombed the Yu military facilities in the area, inflicting heavy damage. The low-altitude strafing by Japanese aircraft caused the Yu troops to lose their morale.</p>
<h3>American Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb Jingzhou, Citizens Extremely Indignant</h3>
<p>Hankou, 28th (Central News Agency) - Enemy aircraft attacked Jingzhou on the afternoon of the 26th, indiscriminately bombing the city before fleeing. According to a subsequent investigation, dozens of people were killed and dozens injured.

<h3>Japanese Army Doctor in Burma Invents Effective Dysentery Drug</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base in Burma: A Japanese Army hospital there has invented a new substitute drug that is superior to emetine, an effective drug for dysentery. In the past, emetine injections were used to treat amoebic dysentery in Burma, and the results were miraculous. However, recently, due to the cessation of imports, the drug has become difficult to purchase. After diligent research by local Japanese Army doctors, this substitute drug has been invented. The method is to extract "biological wheat" from the bark of the "Duo Ji" tree and use it to make an injectable drug. The manufacturing method is extremely simple, and its effect is no less than that of "emetine." Even the most malignant amoebic dysentery can be cured within three to five days after injection of the drug.</p>

<h3>South African Prime Minister Remains in London</h3>

<h3>Famine in Bengal Province of India Worsens</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai - The great famine in the Bengal region of India has recently become increasingly severe. According to消息 received here, 6 million civilians in Bengal are struggling on the brink of death. 300,000 have been admitted to hospitals, of whom 75,000 have died. More than 150,000 others have died from famine, starvation, or malnutrition. This shocking number is expected to increase in the next few days. Because there is no time to report the disposal of these corpses to the authorities, families are burying them themselves. In the metropolis of Calcutta, hundreds of corpses are lying on the streets every day. The Indian government, in order to devise countermeasures, has specially allocated a portion of the railway transportation facilities used for military purposes to transport grain and distribute it to various regions, or has mobilized cargo ships and military trucks to distribute medical supplies. From this, it can be seen that the British are extremely embarrassed by this great chaos before their long-publicized operation to retake Burma and are striving to clean up the tragedy under their government.</p>

<h3>Thrift Campaign: Zhang Yipeng Broadcast</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Citizens' Thrift Campaign, work has been carried out tirelessly. Various practical activities have been held to awaken the entire citizenry to practice thrift. In order to further enable citizens to understand the meaning of thrift, Chairman Zhang Yipeng gave a special broadcast on Shanghai Radio last night, entitled "Explanation of the Six Major Creeds of the Thrift Campaign." He briefly stated that thrift is saving, and economy is frugal. Confucius spoke of gentleness, kindness, respect, frugality, and yielding, and frugality is one part of it. Duke Wen of Wei, wearing clothes of coarse cloth and a hat of thick silk, could revitalize the country and save it from ruin. This is of great importance to individuals and the country. Some people say that the poor are naturally thrifty, and the rich do not need to be thrifty. I think this is a specious argument. You say that the poor are naturally thrifty, but haven't you seen those rickshaw pullers, coolies, and street children gambling with broken pieces of cardboard or worn-out copper coins? The rich seem to not care about spending more money, but you should know that there are not a few people who go to dance halls and game halls, get sick from overwork, and work all night. Now is a time of crisis, and resources are tight, and there is concern that we will not be able to sustain ourselves. If a few people continue to waste arbitrarily, they will face endless trials. Therefore, thrift is particularly important and urgent in today's situation. The purpose of this association is to make thrift a habit for the whole city, so we first briefly put forward six major creeds, which can be summarized into three items: first, clothing; second, diet; and third, social interaction. Its regulations are mostly easy to implement and do not force people to do what is difficult.</p>
<h3>Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf (3)</h3>
<p>Funding and Future</p>
<p>The funding for the Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf, according to the 1942 fiscal year final accounts, amounted to 58,348.82 yuan, averaging 4,862.40 yuan per month. The budget for the 1943 fiscal year is 91,247.60 yuan, averaging 7,604 yuan per month. The budget for temporary expenses in 1943 is 166,500 yuan, including the cost of repairing school buildings and dormitories.</p>
<p>There is no fixed fund or funding. Only this large courtyard can be used. It is said that the foundation area is 466 feet, and the building area is 412.8 square feet, including the so-called "Building No. 1," which is three stories high and 316.8 square feet; "Building No. 2," which is two stories high and 45.8 square feet; and "Building No. 3," which is one story high and 20.2 square feet. Currently, the revenue that can be used is the temporary rental income from the third floor of Building No. 1, which is estimated to be 2,000 yuan per month, or 24,000 yuan per year. Most of the rooms have already been rented by several Japanese residents.</p>
<p>In addition to the income from a portion of the rent, there are fees from the school's affiliated "Treatment Department," which are estimated to be 3,330 yuan per month, or 39,960 yuan per year. Combined with the rent revenue, the estimated total annual income is 63,960 yuan. In the future, the development of the "Treatment Department" will be an important factor for the development of blind and deaf education in the school. Apart from this, there are only the tuition fees paid by students, but these cannot be considered the main funding source.</p>
<p>According to the school's plan, the first floor of Building No. 1 will be renovated, with half of it used as a classroom and half as the "Treatment Department." After renovation, the second floor will be divided into a lecture hall, a music classroom, a principal's office, a faculty office, a drawing room, etc. The third floor will still be used for temporary rentals after renovation. Some renovation work has already begun. However, there are concerns that the source of the monthly operating expenses of over 7,000 yuan will dry up. The huge cost of repairs and renovations is naturally even more unattainable. Therefore, the renovation work on the second floor of "Building No. 1," apart from slightly whitewashing the four walls, has been unable to continue. It is such a pity that such a tall and bright courtyard is now being left vacant! (The End)</p>

The Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Public Bond Fund Management Committee have issued separate notices, hoping that bondholders will collect the full amount of cash from the designated banks at the appointed time to show the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness.</p>
<h3>Pickled Vegetable Industry Association Requests Increased Salt Allocation</h3>
<p>Has Been Approved by the Salt Affairs Authorities</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pickled Vegetable Industry Association, because its members are numerous and need a large quantity of salt, the current allocation is far from the actual needs. In addition, fresh vegetables are now on the market, which is the season for pickling, so the need for salt is urgent. In view of this, the association has repeatedly requested the Salt Affairs Authorities to allocate as much as possible to meet the emergency needs and maintain the people's food supply. This request has been approved, and members will soon be able to obtain [unclear] salt.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Financial Situation: No Significant Changes</h3>
<p>Commodity Prices Remain Stable</p>
<p>The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai last week remained stable as usual. Occasionally, a small number of goods saw a sharp increase in demand, and holders of goods engaged in hoarding, so prices were slightly raised. However, they were detected by authorities, punished according to law, or ordered to suspend business or fined as a warning. Statistics show that there were more than ten such cases throughout the week. As for food, prices fluctuated due to varying sources and changing demand. However, cotton and wool textiles saw the most significant price increases, which was due to [unclear] reasons. As for the financial situation, the official market prices of customs gold and silver ingots remained unchanged, and the discount rate remained at 17%, but the money supply was still very tight, and it was difficult to allocate funds for various industries. Fortunately, the Central Reserve Bank and the [unclear] Bureau managed the situation effectively, and no unfortunate incidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Various Issues as the Work of the Commercial Control Association Enters the Second Stage</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Commercial Control Association has implemented material control, engaged in establishing the autonomy of the Chinese economy through a controlled economy, and is gradually advancing to cope with the rapidly changing situation around it. Whether the Commercial Control Association itself will adopt new strategies for high-level operations in the future is attracting much attention from various parties. The following is an overview of the various issues that need to be implemented.</p>
<p>Progress Since Establishment</p>
<p>The biggest purpose of the establishment of the Commercial Control Association is to achieve the mission of the Chinese economy under the Greater East Asia War and to promote the cooperation of the national government and national capital and the economic cooperation between China and [unclear]. Therefore, powerful figures in the financial world were appointed as directors and supervisors, and engaged in: Unified procurement and allocation of materials; Operation of material exchange between various regions in the country; Supply of export materials; Allocation of import materials; Procurement of materials entrusted by the government; Handling of matters designated and entrusted by the Ministry of Industry and other competent ministries. Observing the progress of its work, the association's administrative organization and various professional committees for important materials were completed in June. In addition, the industry associations of the lower-level organizations were also established in July. The criticisms mainly focus on the following three points: The defects of the Commercial Control Association itself; Insufficient cooperation of economic personnel; The relationship between the Commercial Control Association and various related authorities. The reality of these three points will be described below:</p>
<p>Defects of the Commercial Control Association Itself</p>
<p>The first problem is that the material control work of the Commercial Control Association has shifted sharply from a free economy to a controlled economy for some time. If we can truly understand the current stage of the Chinese economy, then everyone will recognize the difficulty of implementing a controlled economy. As for the preparation of the organization, it undertook the work of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth midway, and at the same time focused on establishing a unified purchasing organization for important materials. Therefore, some people criticized the Commercial Control Association for focusing on the organization and not considering the significant Chinese economic institutions and the possibility of a controlled economy. At times, its work is not only economic work, but often linked to politics, and special attention should be paid to this point. (Excerpt from [unclear] New News) (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Prospects for the South Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>Since landing on Mono Island on October 27, the enemy has dispatched large fleets and transport convoys seven times, attempting to recapture Bougainville Island and New Britain Island, constantly coming to the strong port, wanting to fight to the death, and to reduce Ganben's strategic southern stronghold in one fell swoop. Thanks to the efforts of the Japanese naval air force and surface ships, and the extremely clever strategy of the operational headquarters, they suffered an unprecedented defeat in the history of warfare, sinking and destroying a total of 85 ships, including six battleships, eight aircraft carriers, cruisers, [unclear] ships, and transport ships. This is a huge blow to their new offensive, and the enemy has paid such a high price and still gained nothing. They covered up the continuation of their defeat by greatly publicizing the landing on Cape Torokina on Bougainville Island, which they gained from this huge sacrifice, saying that it had achieved its intended purpose. Furthermore, future battles in this area will not proceed as smoothly as they had hoped, which can be clearly understood from their judgment of the battles they have already encountered and the previous jungle warfare. The longer the battle lasts on the enemy's side, the more the public opinion will clamor for the truth about the defeat. Therefore, while anxiously trying to make the situation on the two islands of Bougainville favorable, they are also planning to seek new results on new battlefields. In other words, they will use new battles to shift their focus, hoping to disperse the strength of the Japanese air force and naval forces in the Solomon Islands and open a way out in the Solomon Islands northward operation. So where will the enemy want to attack in the near future? Judging from the enemy's military strength and previous strategies, it is clear that they will be active in the Central Pacific. Let us try to review their new plan from the enemy's shipbuilding and attack situation.</p>
<p>Utilizing Air Power</p>
<p>Since the start of the war about half a year ago, the enemy has lost most of the aircraft carriers they had before the war, and the tactics they are currently adopting are to utilize a large amount of air power. Therefore, there must be a large number of land-based air force bases. It is only necessary to pull the bases towards the battlefield until the time of operation, without the need for aircraft carriers or large fleets. However, on the other hand, the enemy is actively engaged in building aircraft carriers. After losing most of its remaining aircraft carriers in the South Pacific naval battle, in just one year, the enemy had many more aircraft carriers commissioned and completed the training of its crew. Thus, using this aircraft carrier-centered mobile unit, they conducted island-hopping operations from the Solomon Islands northward, and encountered the strong defense line deployed by the Japanese army from Bougainville Island to New Britain Island. The base air force prepared by them in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea area felt insufficient here. However, they still forcibly [unclear] the Japanese air force base, spending a great deal of resources, and although they were able to suppress the Japanese army's Bougainville Island base at Buin, Balale, etc., they were ultimately unable to completely control the New Britain Island Rabaul base. In this great war, replenishment cannot exceed consumption. They dispatched an aircraft carrier loaded with gasoline, ammunition, and hundreds of aircraft, and paired it with battleships and many other naval vessels, wanting to annihilate the Japanese air force and naval fleet in one fell swoop, and then leisurely land. However, due to the wisdom and bravery of the Japanese naval air force and naval vessels, they were frustrated.</p>
<p>Enemy Fleet Annihilated</p>
<p>As such, Harl Halsey's Southwest Pacific Fleet has become a poor fleet. It has not been able to annihilate Japanese naval vessels and aircraft carriers as desired, and it is extremely difficult to reinforce and replenish the Torokina Point landing troops. Their attempt to conquer Rabaul in one fell swoop, which they had been calling for, has turned into a prolonged state that they do not like, and domestic public opinion will not allow the defeat to be covered up for long. At this point, they seem to have decided to disperse the Japanese forces in order to open up the war situation in this area. This is what they call the Nimitz attack. Nimitz, who is still [unclear], once said that he planned to use the Pacific Fleet to attack and contain the Japanese fleet and air force. On the 68th anniversary of the founding of the US Navy on the 10th of this month, he claimed:</p>
<p>"The United States will soon launch a major offensive against the Japanese army and smash its island [unclear] fortresses. The United States will implement this operation using a single [unclear] direct entry method."</p>
<p>On the 18th, he also said: "The Japanese army cannot but realize that the major offensive in the Central Pacific war situation is coming soon. It is absolutely necessary for us to control the Marshall Islands and the Gilbert Islands and for the US army to land." This can be regarded as proof that he will operate in the Central Pacific. However, what we should consider here is that this time is clearly not like the previous time, when the mobile unit centered on the aircraft carrier came to attack and learn from Minamitori Island and Okinotori Island, and [unclear] withdrew temporarily. He said that he must land, so it can be seen that it is not a temporary attempt at containment. However, because the islands [unclear] in this area are densely populated and are all small coral islands, they cannot deploy their large air power. Therefore, the enemy's activity in this area will center on the activities of the mobile unit with the aircraft carrier as the main engine. The fleet battle under air supremacy that they most hope for is, needless to say, greatly limited. The enemy's [unclear] fleet's attack is exactly what the Japanese army hopes for. Even the Halsey fleet, which came to attack under the cover of a powerful base air force, was slaughtered and left with nothing. Before the Japanese fleet, will the Nimitz fleet also [unclear] the Halsey fleet? (翔: Translated from the November 22, Fourth Section [unclear] Daily News)</p>
<h3>Breaking Through the Perilous Darkness: A True Account of the South Pacific Bloodbath</h3>
<p>Black mountain peaks, layered upon layered, like evil, and bottomless valleys as silent as death. The dense, mournful mist, the rain dripping onto helmets, seeping into bones. In the tropical cold season, a layer of gray floats on the faces of shivering soldiers. These layers of mountains are the Stanley Range, running straight down the back of New Guinea. A certain Japanese unit, sealed off in this dark world by this natural fortress, scattered the Australian troops in this mountain battle and finally broke through 〇〇 and occupied it. All the senses of the soldiers were concentrated on crushing the enemy's fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Seven days passed like a dream, gnawing on bamboo shoots like sprouts, and chewing on grass leaves like goats, yet they did not feel hungry. To 〇〇! Look down. Far away in the darkness, two or three lights faintly shone, emitting a sharp, needle-like glow. Go there and kill them!</p>
<p>The food was gone. A portion of the soldiers was sent to the rear, but it would take many days for them to return with provisions.</p>
<p>"Good! Let's go there to kill and die together!"</p>
<p>In this place, rather than starve to death, let's fight them. After making this decision, a certain unit leader tied on a white headband, and the soldiers all began to prepare together.</p>
<p>"We will die together!"</p>
<p>A certain unit leader gripped his Japanese sword, his eyes flashing brightly.</p>
<p>"Good!"</p>
<p>Sacrifice for the Country</p>
<p>A sharp sound like the breaking of air. Now is the time to offer our lives for the nation.</p>
<p>Charge into the enemy camp where the lights are, and then return to Yasukuni Shrine! A surge welled up from the depths of my heart, and hot sweat flowed down my cheeks.</p>
<p>The suicide squad, after bowing in the direction of the Imperial Palace, sang "Umi Yukaba" in unison, the heroic song penetrating the dense forest as if to intimidate the enemy. This was the image of the divine Japanese soldiers setting out to attack the enemy camp on the night of 〇 month 〇 day.</p>
<p>I was at the 〇〇 base bidding farewell to the 〇〇 unit in early 〇 month. What was that like?</p>
<p>Within 〇 days, under the enemy's group attacks, they completed a landing before the enemy on the north shore of New Guinea. Soon after, on the transport ship, I received the following information from a staff officer.</p>
<p>"The main force of the 〇〇 unit has already occupied positions near the Stanley Range and is preparing to attack the enemy. The attack is scheduled to begin on 〇〇 day."</p>
<p>Indeed, it's fast! A lightning strike.</p>
<p>The enemy army, in order to defend New Guinea and nearby Australia, was fortifying the north and south coastlines. There was also a powerful mobile fleet at sea. However, this fleet was caught by the Japanese naval forces and completely turned into a seabed for algae. That was the famous Battle of the Coral Sea.</p>
<p>"Can the Japanese army break through the Stanley Range, where even wild beasts cannot live?" The enemy, using their own combat capabilities as a standard, arrogantly made this judgment. But for the Japanese army, nothing is impossible. The Stanley Range? ... Just look at the morale of the Japanese soldiers! Fighting spirit! Everything is fighting spirit!</p>
<p>Japan's elite troops landed one after another. Along the coast, there was an endless stretch of dense forest. The shadows of those swiftly marching under the starry sky, rushed through the coconut groves and leaped onto the main road. Bang bang, gunshots rang out. Enemy planes came and began to bomb wildly. The unloaded 〇〇 transport ships had already disappeared into the ocean. Only one was still unloading its last cargo. Bang, bang, bang! A bomb fell. Bastards! Crew members, soldiers, braving the fire, worked hard. Sandbags flew, water gushed, attacking the flames. The well-trained personnel calmly carried out fire-fighting operations. At the same time, in this critical moment, the crane was still creaking and operating non-stop. The deck had already turned into a sea of fire. "Unloading complete!" a first-class transport soldier shouted loudly. A small boat sped towards the shore, blown by the shrapnel, veering to one side. The enemy plane was gone. No more bombs? Look, there are red and green lights coming down from the mountain peak! It's an enemy plane! Here it comes again.</p>
<p>Marching in the Rain</p>
<p>At this time, after securing the landing point, the troops immediately advanced towards the main road. The road was unexpectedly good. The advance party of Yokoyama engineers had already repaired and strengthened the road surface. However, after it rained, the road turned muddy again. "What heavy rain!" the soldiers said, laughing at the sky. This violent, messy rain! Until 〇〇, our only enemy was the rain. With a splash, the column marched in the "gutter." Suddenly the rain stopped, revealing a clear blue sky. Steam rose from the soldiers' shoulders, burdened with heavy helmets.</p>
<p>The enemy soldiers, retreating from the coast, were using Kokoda as their last stronghold of resistance, desperately transporting troops, ammunition, and provisions from Port Moresby using large aircraft. Although friendly planes came to attack them, they continued to resupply. The sharp edge of the Japanese army steadily advanced towards the enemy's stronghold. Like the temperature chart of a patient with a fever, the battle line rose moment by moment.</p>
<p>〇〇 li away from the coast. This was already a vast, flat plain. Coconut palms were everywhere. Papayas were also found. During breaks, because they had been walking on the hot, dry earth, the sweet coconut juice did not suit their tastes; papayas were better. Breaking open the long, oval papaya, a tropical fragrance wafted out, and the thick, yellowish-brown flesh, when bitten into, was truly delicious. What a wonderful meal!</p>
<p>Entering the mountains increased the difficulty, and since no food could be found in the mountains, the rice carried with them had to be conserved as much as possible. The soldiers fought hard with hunger.</p>
<p>After passing the plain near 〇〇, the terrain gradually rose. Every day, they encountered more than three torrential downpours. Mud filled the tops of their military boots, making walking slippery. The column stopped and started, started and stopped. The soldiers' backs and noses often bumped into each other. Rain followed by sunshine, sunshine followed by rain. This was the situation every day, so when their marching feet stopped even briefly, their entire bodies seemed to be soaked in sweat. The soldiers carrying heavy weapons always "stood" to rest. "Why don't you take it off?" There was no need to ask; after taking it off, they would not have the strength to carry it on their shoulders again. Those soldiers, slightly bowing their heads, stood silently. Their broad shoulders looked like solid rocks. During transport and carrying, the burden was always shifted from one shoulder to the other, and other than when they were sleeping for the night, they always carried heavy loads.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there were many rivers on this leg of the journey. Clear streams, as clear as the rivers in mainland Japan, crossed the plains. At night, camping and bathing in the clear streams was extremely enjoyable. But for some reason, strange rashes developed on the bodies of the soldiers who had bathed, causing them to itch unbearably whenever they marched and sweated.</p>
<p>Entering the mountainous area from Oiibi, steep slopes and winding paths along the mountainside connected to each other. The engineering corps felled trees and opened mountains, creating a 〇-meter-wide road. When encountering valleys, they built log bridges; when encountering steep cliffs, they strung vines. Enemy planes flew by every day, but they flew over our heads, counterattacking towards the coast. Kokoda, which had become an enemy stronghold, was located in the highland area under the Stanley Range and had an airfield. For the enemy, it was the heart of the mountain range's defensive position.

<h3>Illustrated Summary of Major Events in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere for the Week</h3>
<p>Based on reports and telegrams from November 22nd to 28th</p>
<h3>Autumn Night</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huinan</p>
<p>The season I love the most is autumn—the cool breeze, the clear sky, the lively islands, and the flying fields. I call autumn the season of freedom because of this image.</p>
<p>I love the vitality of spring, the splendor of summer, and the solemnity of winter, but I love the tranquility of autumn even more.</p>
<p>The fallen leaves are the refuse of the era; the bare branches reveal the truth of reality.</p>
<p>Autumn night! It is quiet. I seem to intentionally put on thinner clothes and wander alone in the desolate streets. The cool breeze blows on me, the moonlight caresses me, and I feel cold; but in my spirit, there is infinite sweetness and tranquility. And I still intentionally wander in the quiet, cool autumn streets. This is intentional wandering, not wandering aimlessly. Until the moonlight fills my whole body, bathing me in its refreshing light, I feel as if I have taken a mercury bath in my consciousness. Urged by the night breeze, I reluctantly bid farewell.</p>
<p>Friend, have you ever experienced the night? Have you paid attention to the night? Especially the tranquil night of late autumn.</p>
<p>The most beautiful thing in the world is a quiet night, especially on a clear day. Whether one is indulging in fantasies alone or having a heart-to-heart talk with friends, the quiet of the night is the most suitable for people.</p>
<p>Looking up, I see sparse stars in the darkening sky, twinkling like the eyes of lonely lovers, smiling at you deeply, sorrowfully, yet sweetly.</p>
<p>The still night, with a refreshing breeze, is the most suitable for contemplation. You can indulge in fantasies of future joys, laugh out loud, or shed tears for past sorrows. At this time, the cool breeze will dry your tears, the moonlight will comfort your heart, and your breath will reveal your worries, resonating with your heart. No one—assuming they are human—will laugh at your emotions. This is the mystery of the night, and also its greatness!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am not a painter and cannot paint the emotional stars, and I am not a writer or a poet, so I cannot use gorgeous words to describe this silent autumn night, which contains the true meaning of beauty.</p>
<h3>Song</h3>
<p>— Hu Ruoliu</p>
<p>I love songs, and I especially like singing, especially vigorous and majestic songs that invigorate the spirit.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because of my inherently strong nature, but I like to sing majestic songs. Especially when I am lonely, or on a moonlit night, it is so interesting and meaningful to raise my voice and sing majestic songs!</p>
<p>I believe that songs invigorate the spirit. I remember the world-famous "La Marseillaise," which aroused the decadent and dispirited French soldiers and helped them achieve victory.</p>
<p>I love "La Marseillaise," and I love the many vigorous and majestic songs of China even more.</p>
<p>Although I have not been able to sing majestic songs since I came to Shanghai, this makes me feel very bad inside. Especially the young ladies across from me, who also like to sing, but they sing soft and depressing songs, "Love's Twists and Turns," "Books Everywhere Open," "Dream Man"... which make my head hurt when I hear them.</p>
<p>Now, as I am clenching my fist and writing, their singing is coming again, that delicate, melodious, numbing song. Every word and every sentence is unbearable. So, I raise my voice and sing—</p>
<p>"With hair bristling in anger, leaning on the railing, the drizzling rain stops, looking up, roaring to the sky, my heart filled with fervor..."</p>
<p>After I sang this vigorous song, the delicate, numbing songs could no longer be heard.</p>
<h3>Untitled</h3>
<p>— Yan Shizhi</p>
<p>Today—</p>
<p>Is not my day to sing.</p>
<p>My voice has become hoarse; my lips and tongue are already bitter;</p>
<p>Only a fire burns in my chest, igniting anger.</p>
<p>But I will use the tears that I swallow to extinguish it.</p>
<p>Because I know that anger is useless.</p>
<p>I want to clearly see what kind of hideous and cruel executioner destroyed her youth.</p>
<p>I will use my weapon: my writing, my javelin, to fight it</p>
<p>Until we achieve complete victory.</p>
<p>Today—</p>
<p>Is not my day to sing,</p>
<p>Tomorrow!</p>
<p>Will be our day to sing triumphant songs.</p>
<p>When victory follows,</p>
<p>The sun of tomorrow will rise at the same time</p>
<p>Our songs,</p>
<p>Will resound all around!</p>

<h3>Appreciating Chrysanthemums in Huangyuan Garden</h3>
<p>— Zou Kanru</p>
<p>A Gift for the Owner of Yueyuan</p>
<p>Carrying friends, strolling into the flower bushes, I know that there are reclusive old men in the city, All of the topics here are about old friends, every time we praise the strong integrity that braves the autumn wind. Withdrawing and satisfying oneself is a happy life, good art can rival the skills of creation, The winding path leads to seclusion, far from the worldly affairs, a crane dances in the courtyard.</p>
<h3>Seventh Anniversary of Lu Xun's Death</h3>
<p>— Rong Gobi</p>
<p>Our mentor—Mr. Lu Xun,</p>
<p>It has been seven years since you left this world,</p>
<p>Although your physical body is dead,</p>
<p>Your ever-great spirit lives forever in the hearts of every young person,</p>
<p>You are a bright star,</p>
<p>Guiding us forward in the darkness!</p>
<p>Our mentor—Mr. Lu Xun,</p>
<p>Today we do not need to hold any ceremonies,</p>
<p>We will only commemorate you with practical actions,</p>
<p>We must learn your selfless spirit,</p>
<p>Bravely pick up the javelin you left us,</p>
<p>"In a place that can be cursed, defeat an era that can be cursed"!</p>
<h3>Apprentice</h3>
<p>— Shu Jun</p>
<p>I get up,</p>
<p>Before dawn;</p>
<p>Tidying up the bedding,</p>
<p>Hurriedly wiping and sweeping;</p>
<p>The coal stove is still dark,</p>
<p>Waiting for me to light it,</p>
<p>A cloud of smoke,</p>
<p>Suffocating me and causing tears to fall!</p>
<p>Although it is irritable,</p>
<p>But I still have to light it well.</p>
<p>Outside, the sound of a cart is coming,</p>
<p>I habitually—</p>
<p>Pick up the lacquered nightsoil bucket,</p>
<p>Run to the door to pour it out,</p>
<p>The street is still desolate,</p>
<p>The night wind is like a sharp knife!</p>
<p>The old man pushing the cart,</p>
<p>As usual, smiles and says "Good morning"!</p>
<p>Hurriedly running back,</p>
<p>I am being called from upstairs,</p>
<p>It is the landlady's voice;</p>
<p>Instructing me to fetch wash water,</p>
<p>—to serve and wash up.</p>
<p>The doors open,</p>
<p>At that time it is still early,</p>
<p>Business is slow;</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>Again, carrying a bamboo basket,</p>
<p>I follow the mistress to the small vegetable market.</p>
<p>Coming back, I wash up alone,</p>
<p>Slowly, the market fills up,</p>
<p>I become a shop assistant!</p>
<p>Darting back and forth in the shop,</p>
<p>So busy that I can't breathe,</p>
<p>The boss stands by with his arms crossed,</p>
<p>Just smiling slightly;</p>
<p>Occupation, making money, a way out…</p>
<p>Apprentice, shop assistant, human…</p>
<p>Stirring up my chaotic thoughts,</p>
<p>I stand blankly,</p>
<p>—Standing in the shop,</p>
<p>Dazed,</p>
<p>A slap in the face!</p>
<p>"You little devil! You know how to play dead"!</p>
<p>The boss shouts angrily:</p>
<p>His eyes like a mad beast,</p>
<p>Revealing a menacing gaze,</p>
<p>I angrily want to resist,</p>
<p>But the giant hand of life,</p>
<p>Holds me down;</p>
<p>I endure silently,</p>
<p>But I feel my face burning!</p>

<h3>West Qing Basketball First Week: Eastern Team Shows Pride</h3>
<p>Many Talented Players: Overcoming the Western Allied Forces; Ren Yu Defeated: China Film Shows Great Promise</p>
<p>The West Qing Basketball League kicked off last Monday (November 22nd). On Jing'an Road, fans were as thick as clouds, and in the basketball gym, the noise shook the sky. In this competition, there are two Group A games and two Group B games every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and only one Group B game every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. This week, Zhongbei vs. Eastern was originally scheduled for the 26th, but unfortunately, Zhongbei postponed it. A North-South showdown may be reserved as a highlight. Here is a brief account of the Group A games in the first week:</p>
<p>First Night (22nd)</p>
<p>China Film Wins Against Amateur: Amateur has Tao Shaosheng and Hu Xiaoguang from the Red Team, as well as You Youliang, Zhou Zhi, and Wang Wenji from the Paramount, among other veterans. The China Film lineup is slightly inferior. Before the game, many said that Amateur would definitely win, but the reporter predicted early that China Film could win. This is not the reporter speaking with hindsight. Basketball emphasizes teamwork. Amateur was hastily assembled, and there is inevitably an air of disorganization. Under the earnest guidance of Qian Xucang, China Film is improving daily, passing smoothly, and the players all feel confident of winning. The result was a 32-28 victory over a strong enemy. Gao Mangsheng and Ren Yawei of China Film performed exceptionally well. Liu Qiong's interception of the ball under the basket was unique, but his stamina seemed insufficient. Shu Shi was hardworking and showed great effort. Youliang and Shaozhi of Amateur had good skills, but because they could not know themselves and their opponents, and the whole team was not in harmony, they suffered defeat!</p>
<p>Tongren Wins Against Dihua: In this game, Tongren's performance was not as ideal as it should have been. The offense was scattered, and the defense was lax. Dihua could have won but did not. The reason was that they were too aggressive. They committed many fouls, and a certain player was ejected for violently bumping into the rib of Tongren's Xu Antong (at which time Dihua was leading). They had to play with four players, and being outnumbered, they were inevitably defeated. I hope that player will learn from his mistakes and cultivate his temperament more.</p>
<p>Second Night (24th)</p>
<p>Huanan Wins Against Sanshu: Sanshu are all veterans, and there is a sense of waning strength. Huanan are all young and strong, in the flourishing autumn of their careers, but the performance was evenly matched. The reason is that Huanan lacked the strong player Liu Fuzhi, and they were also slightly complacent. A proud army is bound to be defeated. They were already very lucky not to be defeated. Although Sanshu are veterans, they are still willing to invigorate their spirits and work hard. Under normal circumstances, they had a good chance of winning. Although they lost by a small margin of 44-49, they can be considered blameless!</p>
<p>Shan Team Wins Against Ren Yu: It can be said that the Shan team are students of Ren Yu. Everyone expected the Shan team to lose, but unexpectedly, this battle was a major upset. The student surpassed the teacher, and the once-renowned Ren Yu team was defeated by students they had trained themselves. This was undoubtedly the biggest upset of this year's West Qing Basketball League. The advantage of the Shan team may be their morale. The defeat of Ren Yu is perplexing. Perhaps they were holding back, or there were other reasons that we cannot know. The result was 38-28, a difference of as many as five baskets, which is quite strange!</p>
<p>Third Night (26th)</p>
<p>In the first game, the Wing team did not appear, so the Giant team played against Monaco. The tactics of these two Western teams were identical, so the game was very close and the scores were unusually difficult to get and close. Giant's Miloff and Funic's long shots were effective, and they won 19-11.</p>
<p>The second game was supposed to be Zhongbei vs. Eastern. Both sides had famous players, and the fans were eager to see who would win. So, the room was packed that night. It was the biggest crowd yet. Zhongbei's main player, Li Qizhong, was injured and requested a postponement. Eastern was temporarily replaced by the Western Allied Forces. The friendship match was a tough and exciting one. Eastern had Paramount as its base, plus Bao Songyuan, Zhang Jiajun, Gao Baosheng, Li Zude, and Du Bensheng. Many talented players. This game used a rotation strategy, mainly to prepare for future team coordination. The Western Allied Forces were made up of the Monaco team and the Giant team. They had just finished the Group A game and had to reorganize, so they were inevitably tired. Eastern waited in ease, and as a result, they narrowly defeated the Allied Forces 38-35.</p>
<p>Encouragement to the Eastern Team</p>
<p>Looking at the situation in West Qing, the three major Chinese teams are Eastern, Zhongbei, and Ren Yu. Unfortunately, Ren Yu has already lost once, which has greatly dampened their spirit, so they are at a disadvantage overall. The only team that has shown pride for us Chinese is Eastern. Zhongbei is another strong team. After Eastern's performance the night before, the reporter has something to say as a humble offering.</p>
<p>The Eastern team has the following generals who can fight against strong enemies: Lu Zhongen, Bao Songyuan, Wang Jinghu, Zhang Shaoqing, Xu Wenyan, Gao Baosheng, Zhang Jiajun, Qian Jingyun, etc. Feng Nianhua is often injured, and Du Bensheng is still in training and in the rational stage of his game, so he cannot cope with strong enemies for the time being.</p>
<p>Eastern's tactics, although using man-to-man defense, are such that Xu Wenyan is too short and Zhang Shaoqing likes to run around. Using man-to-man defense, these two will inevitably have loopholes. Therefore, when using man-to-man defense, you must use Lu Zhongen, Zhang Jiajun, Bao Songyuan, Gao Baosheng, and Wang Jinghu. These five tigers are fast and strong. They will be able to guard their assigned players. Scoring will depend entirely on Wang Jinghu and, to a lesser extent, Bao Songyuan and Gao Baosheng. If using a five-man zone defense, the players should be Bao Songyuan, Lu Zhongen, Zhang Shaoqing, Xu Wenyan, and Wang Jinghu. This lineup was originally the full Paramount team, which has always used man-to-man defense. However, the reporter believes that if using man-to-man defense, if one person fails, everyone will be affected. Xu Wenyan is not good at guarding. Zhang Shaoqing has both over- and under-performance. Therefore, with the above lineup, I strongly recommend using the five-man zone defense, as they have been working together for a long time and can achieve perfect harmony. Moreover, the forwards are all good shooters, so they will definitely score more points. (Mei Bicheng)</p>
<h3>Football League Group A: Three Strong Teams Sing Triumphant Songs</h3>
<p>The Police Brigade is Unbeatable; Lianyi and Donghua Each Win by Two Goals</p>
<p>In the football league, the Police, Lianyi, and Donghua teams each defeated their opponents last week, advancing to the next level and maintaining the three-way stalemate.</p>
<p>The Police Are Unbeatable</p>
<p>Last Saturday's match against the Jews at Jiaozhou Park did not attract many spectators, as people thought the outcome was already decided. But in fact, the police showed their superb skills. The little yellow-haired player's rush, the wingers' flights, and the team's seamless coordination were truly worthy of appreciation by true football fans. It is a pity that the police's performance was marred by the fact that in the last fifteen minutes, both teams became violent, almost engaging in a full-scale brawl, which was regrettable. Fortunately, it did not escalate. The police's Yu Tian deliberately injured someone in the first half and was ejected. The police played with ten men throughout the game, but the Jews were unable to win with a numerical advantage. Their skills were clearly inferior. The result was 4-1, with the little yellow-haired player scoring three consecutive goals, which was incredibly fast. He is truly a dangerous figure that our Chinese team must be wary of.</p>
<p>Lianyi Defeats Overseas Chinese United Team</p>
<p>Yesterday (November 28th) morning, the enthusiasm at Yiyuan Stadium was fervent. Lianyi's lineup was the same as in the match against the Three Provinces team, with Li Yichen still in the shadows, except that Yu Zhenyue was the only change on the left wing. After yesterday's game, it has become clear that Lianyi's defense is strong but their offense is weak. Li Tiansheng and Wu Qixiang are excellent in their positions and have superb footwork, unmatched by others. The forwards lack coordination and footwork. Besides Xu Wenkui's few good shots, Gao Baosheng and Fei Chunhua are too weak. Qu Yongfu plays too much baseball, and Yu Zhenyue is not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese United team performed well. Xu Erzhu's handling of Qu Yongfu, combined with Yu Zhenyue's uselessness, was very appropriate. Unlike the previous game, Fan Xiaojin was marked, which prevented him from launching any attacks. Lianyi scored one goal in the first half by Fei Chunhua and one goal in the second half by Gao Baosheng, resulting in a 2-0 victory and advancing to the next level.</p>
<p>The Three Provinces Threaten Donghua</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the weather was drizzly and gloomy, which dampened the fans' enthusiasm. At Jiaozhou, the scene was dismal. Everyone thought that Donghua would easily win, but unexpectedly, the Three Provinces' young players showed a new face and almost created a tie. This truly fits the saying that newborn calves are not afraid of tigers. Donghua's victory was assured, and He Fuzhen sat on the sidelines, while Lin Gen was stationed in the central plains. The center of gravity was shaken, and with Chen Shiming as the right midfielder, it was difficult to coordinate the attack. However, the Three Provinces' luck was also very poor yesterday. Donghua's shots were saved by Gao Zhiwen more than half a dozen times. If things had been normal, the bottom spot could have been defended. Yesterday's game was tense throughout. In the last fifteen minutes, Donghua was only leading 3-2. The Three Provinces' offensive was fierce, with the ambition to break through again and create a tie. But in the end, they lacked strength and were unable to achieve their goal. Instead, Han Longhai made a sneak attack, and Donghua increased the score to 4-2, adding two points to their standings.

<p>Special Edition of Mr. Liu Haisu's Painting Exhibition</p>
<h3>Introduction to Mr. Liu Haisu's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Haisu will be publicly exhibiting his recent works (from November 30th to December 11th, at the China Painting Gallery at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Jing'an Temple Road). Mr. Haisu's integration and mastery of both Chinese and Western painting styles, along with his reputation in the art and cultural world, are already well-known to people in Shanghai, so there is no need for further introduction. However, my admiration for Mr. Haisu lies not only in his humble demeanor but also in his bold and unrestrained character; not only in his exquisite artistry but also in his unique creative approach. It is this bold character that allows him to create magnificent and imposing compositions; it is this unique creative approach that allows him to produce outstanding works that represent the era. I am originally an outsider to the art of painting, but I enjoy observing and studying it. Recently, I have had the opportunity to view famous paintings in the studios of gentlemen such as Wu Hufan and Liu Haisu, and I have benefited greatly. I deeply believe that painters of every era who achieve fame and are remembered forever must have a style in their works that suits the characteristics of the time, and they must create independently, not rigidly adhering to formal imitations of ancient models. Now, Mr. Haisu is also able to grasp the two special characteristics of the era and creativity. Furthermore, with a solid family background and a deep understanding of the painting styles of his predecessors, as well as extensive travels around the world and exposure to world-renowned paintings, his works are always ingeniously crafted, uniquely created, and powerfully imposing, truly extraordinary. This is by no means accidental. Therefore, on the eve of the exhibition, I offer a few words to express my humble opinion and seek correction from the visitors. The works in this exhibition are divided into two parts: the Chinese painting section consists of sixty-one pieces, and the Western painting section consists of fifty-nine pieces, truly a grand spectacle. Recently, I have also obtained several paintings selected by Mr. Haisu, which will be reproduced and printed later as a special collection, to allow readers to preview and to repay Mr. Haisu's refined intentions.</p>
