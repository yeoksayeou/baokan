<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">中樞人事更張 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>此次最高國防會議決議調仔陳羣氏爲江蘇省長，梅思平氏爲內政部長，陳君慧氏爲實業部長，乃爲中樞人事之重要更張。吾人謁誠期待人事更動以後之實際成效，關於今後江蘇省政，業經兩度申論並略有獻議。茲願再加補充，並對今後內政與實業兩部貢獻若干意見。</p>
<p>夫疆吏跋扈，中央政令不出都門，自民國以來，已成司空見慣。近年吾蘇情形，不幸蹈此覆轍。中央雖以人事問題，遇事不免曲予優容，而人民則殊有政令紛歧，無所適從，動觸法網，啼笑皆非之感。且中外與論，口譏腹誹，實亦有損政府威信。新省長陳羣氏，前在內長任內，目覩中央政令不能推行於近幾，其苦悶當較吾人爲尤甚。今陳氏外調，必能痛感利弊所在，以身作則，率先遵行中央法令，使省自爲政之風氣，爲之歪變。國家在戰時，愈賴有鐵的紀律，以維持社會秩序安寗。欲使人民遵守紀律，尤應先從政府官吏遵守紀律始。江蘇以政治，經濟，文化，地域種種關係，居各省領袖之地位，省政之一舉一動，實足以轉移各省之視聽。陳氏素治法律，重法令，守紀律，乃法律家言行一致之特色。故吾人特反覆申述，以爲陳氏下車之贈言。</p>
<p>其次，梅思平氏在事變前，以主持江寗實騐縣知名於時。縣是國家的雛形，縣政是國家內政的一端，縣政與國家內政範圍雖有廣狹之不同，而處理方法則初無二致。內政修明，然後民生安定。，民生安定，然後纔能談到種種經濟建設問題。中國近年來民生不能安定的最大原因，是由於各地親民之官，十九不能保護人民，反而摧殘剝削人民，民不聊生，更伺從談到生產建設。我們希望梅氏在就職以後，首先注意吏治問題。關於縣長區長之人選須嚴定甄用標準，絕對不以人情或本人之歷史而稍涉通融。關於縣長區長之玫核，寗嚴勿寬，寗枉勿縱。其有貪汚虐民之實據者，尤應立施應得之罪，宣示全國，使意圖玩法者，知所警惕畏懼，不敢再輕於嘗試。然後，政治方有淸明，民生方有安定之希望。我們期待梅氏對於內政之改革者甚多，但今日所提出者却爲前提的主要點。如果主要點無法解決，其他問題，都爲舍本逐末的迂關之談。</p>
<p>中國經濟復興之途徑，徑在增加生產，振興實業，其總樞紐則操之於實業部。陳君慧氏，在黨國中雖爲後進，聞其見識遠大，朝氣蓬勃，操行純潔，始終不脫書生本色。以之推動經濟建設，主持經濟行政，必可收言行一致之效。吾人希望陳氏本　向來勇往邁進之精神，在最短期內做到下列幾點：</p>
<p>增加生產，非空言所可倖致。第一要有計劃，第二更</p>
<p>要見諸實行。陳氏在過去曾提出各種增產計劃，希望</p>
<p>今番加以總檢討。共可行者，應立付實施，並限期完</p>
<p>成。其不可行者，應即延約專家，重行計劃。總之，</p>
<p>對於一切增產計劃，均要有說到辦到之精神，勿使歲</p>
<p>月悠悠，結果還是紙面文章。　　　經濟行政機構，與農工商業接屬之機會最多。用人之</p>
<p>得當與否，與農工商業之發展，關係太大，過去中央及各省市經濟機構之一切措施，尤其用人方面，更値得當局深切反省。陳氏辦事精干，律身謹嚴，但是主</p>
<p>持全國經濟行政者，決非一身廉潔即可成事。不僅以</p>
<p>身作則，躬行廉潔，更須潛移默化，養成風氣。　　　物價漲落，則於供求問題，固屬盡人皆知，供求小能</p>
<p>相稱之原因，一山產量不足，運輸困難，市塲存貨短</p>
<p>少。一山於囤　壟斷。近年物價暴漲之原因，屬於後</p>
<p>者爲多，其事實可以此次上海棉紗布登記之數量爲證</p>
<p>。囤積商民之擾亂物價，固屬痛恨，對於經濟行政機</p>
<p>構在事前熟視視覩，養　成患，迨至事後措置，不免</p>
<p>引起社會更大之擾攘。希望對於各地物價以及有　經</p>
<p>濟問題，責成各地經濟行政機構，隨時予以積極的事</p>
<p>前糾正防止，勿待嚴重之現象已成，然後消極的　謀</p>
<p>補苴辦法。　　　近年上海保險業畸形發展，陸續成立之保險公司小下</p>
<p>一百餘家，其中資本欠殷實者聞亦不少，其投資之是</p>
<p>否安全，姑置不論，即以開支而言，分散愈多，開支</p>
<p>加大，即對於保戶之保障亦愈薄，爲　定吾國保險業</p>
<p>之基礎起見，應即以提高資本額辦法，督促合併，並</p>
<p>嚴密監督業務。</p>
<p>華中　興公司所經營之各公司，其中華股部份　得之</p>
<p>股息紅利，聞以業主未曾具領，均均交實業部代領，</p>
<p>歷年累積，爲數不貨，値茲國內實業需要資金發展，</p>
<p>各銀行存款短絀，無力貸放之際，亟應將上項存款結</p>
<p>淸本息，轉存國內殷實銀行，規定以低利貸放各種民</p>
<p>生企業，專供增產之用。</p>
<p>此外，陳氏最近訪問日本返國，對於日本戰時經濟建設，諒有深刻觀察。希望陳氏能將觀摩所得，斟酌國內人力物力情形，從速擬　一種整個經濟建設計劃。並以全力促其實現。</p>

<h3 id="c2">德傘兵營救出險墨　索里尼抵德境　將領導組織法西斯新政府 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據悉：墨索里尼已於德軍保護下抵德。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德元首行營十二日發表：德降落傘部隊保安隊親衛隊等爲解救前被背叛份子逮捕之墨索里尼統帥，十二日積極進行解救作戰給果，墨索里尼統帥現已得自由，巴特里奥政權對英美約定　渡統帥之企圖，於此已告失敗。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德元首行　十二日二十二時以特別公報發表：墨索里尼統帥巳被德軍救出，但關於營救之地點及其他則尙未發表。蓋關於墨索里尼之行踪，自七月二十四日墨氏出席法西斯大評議會後，即已杳無音訉，於公報中亦幾有五十日未發表關於墨氏之消息　但據德外部方面之消息，　索里尼於七月二十五日上午出席法西斯大評議會後，即往晤國王愛麥虞限三世於私邸，歸途即由巴特里奥所施之陰謀，被押至憲兵營中，迨至九月上旬復輾轉被移至羅馬附近之庫拉斯奇要塞。嗣後傳再被移至伊塔灣之彭阿島。但在此次停戰協定中，將墨索里尼移交英美爲重要條件之一，故路透社曾報道稱，墨索里尼統帥已被押至北非。但於今法西斯國民革命統帥墨索里尼又由德軍降落傘部隊解救再度出現，且將以義大利法西斯國民政府首領之地位，活躍於國際政局間。傳新法四斯政府預定由前法西斯黨書記　法利那齊，文化宣傳部長巴威尼及墨索里尼公子費特里奧等組織行政委員會爲最高行政機關，今新政府首腦墨索里尼統帥東山再起，對於新政府將有莫大之助力，又以巴特里奥爲首　之美傀儡政權自發表投降後，因德軍作戰之神迅及義民心之離散，現僅保其殘喘而已。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　倫敦悉權威方面稱：墨索里尼從未經反軸心軍拘禁。被德軍救出時，亦未在反軸心軍手中。故所傳墨索里尼曾被拘於西西里，實屬無稽之談。倫敦方而並未如墨氏之踪跡。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　路透社記者稱？墨索里尼之獲救·乃此次戰爭中最勇敢最驚人之事件，希特勒對此次計劃之成功，　感極爲滿意。該記者　測此事發生在近巴勒摩之西西里小鎭，墨氏被救出險後，即由飛機載往義本土，此舉所產生之政洽效果相當偉大，尤以影響於巴爾幹者爲甚，因　氏之被救，不僅爲　敢冒險之行爲，抑且顯示凡忠於德國者，亦受德國所忠。</p>

<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　據海通社訉，倫敦交換電　社所發巴勒摩之消息稱：巴特里奥政府　命已無幾日。衆信或將由社會主義者波諾莫繼其後任爲義政府之首領，巴勒摩當將成爲義政府之所在地，該地當局刻已採取非常措施。</p>

<p>羅馬十三日中央社電據海通社訉，羅馬電台昨發表義境德軍司令之文告稱：義大利之同胞平，義德并肩作戰三年餘，而義政府竟肯棄德國盟邦，當君等之同胞正在西西里及加拉布里亞浴血而戰時，君等之政府已與敵方從事談判而卒引狼入室，此等敵人當不顧聖　及我同胞之家庭及婦女，恣意宜及早決定矣。叛逆之長官與政府已毋庸服從　命令，爲諸君之榮譽計，　速加入我方投效德軍，吾人當給以世界最佳良之配備，以保衛君等之祖國，反抗殘暴之敵人，吾人對不歸者決不虧待。</p>

<p>戰事的進展，使此次大戰之眞正的性格愈趨　朗這　性格，早巳不能由聯盟或勢的形式所能處理了、這就是新歐洲誕生之前的陣痛、但更明瞭者，歐洲將由二大勞力而形成。共一是德國所領導的中部歐洲、另一是　聯所想領導的東部歐洲。</p>
<p>史城之戰與色當之戰</p>
<p>決定歐洲運命的東部戰綫之人規模戰爭、可稱是歷史上空前的戰爭、雌雄雖尙未決，但一般地說，　　進入第五年。可視為是決定的時期。史海林格勒之戰，常　色當之戰相提並論，色當之戰，不僅決定拿　崙三世並法國的運命、且在歐洲的運命上也有決定的作用。因色當之戰，歐洲　權乃　然由巴黎而移至柏林。但　決定益不　俾斯寥的天才對拿破崙三世之好戰主義的勝利、乃是歷史發展的結果。</p>
<p>德國人民並中部歐洲的經濟力，遠　西部歐洲之上、這市實、法國在第一次世界大戰中，難賴英美的援助『而博得一時的勝利，獲得了名義上的歐洲　機，但並未有所變更。史達林格勒之戰，或可說是歐洲　權更向東方移動的象　吧！史達林格勒的反攻、的　非常激烈，但我們應該記住。　反攻是深入蘇聯領土的境內、及這裏祗有德軍一師團被殲滅、　入敵境的德軍全力並未被打例。假使綿互數千公里互相對峙著的德蘇二軍中之任何一方崩潰、則未　　的一方、即可視為將來歐洲的建設者。所以在這裏我們可以明白，歐洲旣非由美國，亦不由英國，而將由大　內的强國所指專·但英笑雖是圈外的國家，在大陸上尙殘有着赖種要素。</p>
<p>英美妄想長期占據歐洲</p>
<p>事實上，英美用盡一切手段，阻塞這歷史的發展、援助　多亡命政的鳥想復活落伍的勢　均衡及聯盟政策。但這些亡命政府是離開視實的存祚很遠的東西，所以用援助他們的方法、不能製造歷史。　把歐洲到分為　聯　英國的勢力圖的泰晤士報計劃案，巳被蘇聯當局的宣言所消　。這是十九世紀的時代錯　無條件占領與在占領地施行軍政的政策、證明英國除陳舊的帝國主義以外並無何種建設的理念‘英美想長期占領歐洲、以便對歐洲民衆再施行民主主義的敎育。</p>
<p>歐洲　權非蘇即德</p>
<p>是蘇美白　不能希　　　民衆支援帝國主義政策的證據、反之蘇聯的政策，即向着爭取人心、經過四年的戰爭，人民的困苦愈趨增大，尤以英美的空襲，現大都市現出了混亂的狀態。中產階級因戰時總動員而沒落，使歐洲社會失却了支持歐洲社會秩序的支柱。歐洲今發如不因德國的勝利而獲得新秋序、便將由於蘇聯的勝利而新範於蘇聯的政權之下。這歷史的發展，任何勞力也不能加以　更。英美尙想　止這趨勢，使德蘇二敗俱塲。從這觀點出發，可以國到奎貝克會談的眞相。奎貝克會　申，決定不　在本年中　成蘇聯所要求的第二戰線。英美狀傾注更大的努力於東亞戰綫。蓋英美恐怕歐洲戰事如先於東亞戰昨而結束時，　義聯對英美的立地將較有利。所以英美趁歐洲戰　尙朱結束之前，用其增强的勞力擬攻擊日軍陣地。毒辣的英美，希望德蘇在東部戰裁死戰而至於兩敗但塲，同時　趁此機會摧毀日本軍。　英美的新政策，當於使蘇聯憤激，　果，在　　與美國之間，引起了政洽的糾紛，於是戰爭無論在軍事上政治上均突入重火附段。。因歐洲戰並大束亞戰而創造的新歷史、將在戰爭第五年中表現確定的展開。</p>
<p>嚴備英美登陸德國縮短戰綫</p>
<p>蘇聯自開始本年發季的攻勢戰以來，在束部戰綫所出動的戰車與飛機之數量、實非常龍大。總之，蘇聯雖說從英美獲得相當數量武器的供給。然而這許多武器的大部分。並不是吳美所供給的東西他。他們不容躊躇逡巡。史　朴恐怕在此次的大攻勢中已作孤注一擲的冒險之舉、蘇聯軍的戰力誠不可輕　、唯大概已到達了限界。在蘇聯軍的大規校反攻中，德國所視為最重要的問題，乃在　量縮，小長大的戰綫，使成為義强大的防衛綫。瑞典京城的軍事專門家稱，現在德國最好的方法，應盡量整理縮短東部職戰綫的防衛綫，以備反軸心軍在西歐發陸或說史達林緊決製求第二戰綫者。因他獲悉英美究竟不　實行大規　戰　的緣故，史達林洞悉英美如敢於在西歐登陸、則他們的勢力將踏　歐洲大陸、所以當然不希望這種作戰能夠成功。　是史太林的本意。</p>
<p>英美與素聯　隙難塡</p>
<p>但在英突方面，如不應允蘇聯的要求時，則英美　縱聯之問的　隙，終究不能地埋，徒然空費時問於無謂的議論。而且　論怎樣說，西歐的大規模登陸戰如不展開，則現在的戰局不達到決定的階段、井且在實行這種大戰時、英美似乎不能不密切合作，但美國在太平洋被東制於他們的第一號敵人日本。所以美國不欲祚歐洲戰綫把其　强的軍隊供犧牲。美國的武器生產力。隨極强大，但在人的　源上却有限界，故羅斯福主張把其站銳的軍戰用於對日戰令為主。邱吉爾　在處於羅斯福與史　林的二而夾攻中，歡洲作戰　太平洋作戰的二者，不能不妥為安排。（翔：新聞自）九月一日東京每日</p>

<h3 id="c51">改進國醫的建議 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣澤民</p>
<p>中西醫學不同，各有　勝，但西醫多所發明中醫則故步自封，其故有三：</p>
<p>缺乏創造改革精神，園醫每執成方而不思改變，須如學術是進步的，如若　為今制之方劑，較古方劑為宜時，當予改變為是。</p>
<p>於生理學。解剖學，細　學，器械使用等，不　究，因之國家若遭遇戰爭時，不能趨使前方　任救該工作，發生疫漓，缺乏急救妥善辦法，，致受政府所輕視。</p>
<p>國家多難，內亂外每頻亟，對於本國醫學事一柴，未曾有所獎勵或提但，缺乏費經，未曾有妥善組織結構，以致醫學未有　足進步。</p>
<p>以此三大原由而觀之，中醫之所以日　低下者事非無因，溯白民國十七年，政府議決取銷中醫，國醫界如業當頭捧擊。始於常年開全國第一次聞醫代表大會，　請政府收囘成命及改進國醫辦法，此時之　醫未始不具有熱烈之精神者也。近觀全國各地醫學硏究會林立，致力於　醫改造者，大有人在，但政府之不予澈底提倡，國醫界未有組織連絡，改進國醫辦法，近　未　進展，當此次戰爭將戰終點，建設時期聯將開始，醫學事業，何獨不然，今持略述國醫改至辦法，以與國醫同志，互相切磋為政府改進中醫一大　助，　見如左：</p>
<p>立國醫專門學校</p>
<p>政府應在全國各都會及各省省會，普般醫學專門學樣，培植中國醫學人才，聘任對於醫學確具相當學問者為敎授，分列各科，並分三·四·五年制度</p>
<p>醫生開業須經過　格考試學生如在學校的醫師處　業終了後須經過敎育部特派考試員加以嚴格考試檢審以免庸醫　斥，已開業者，亦須經過如斯手續考試不及格者，當予摒除。</p>
<p>兼採外醫之所長西洋醫學及醫學器械，對於醫學上　有供獻　與採用、以　國醫所　。</p>
<p>創立中醫醫院　根　西醫醫院組　法，在全國各地，普設中醫醫院，以應　者之需要，並博採其所長。</p>
<p>加强國發連絡結　　今除國　公會及少　醫學硏究社外，　醫　極少參加社團活動，以致影響醫學上之進　創造，　普遍設立醫學硏究社，時開座談會，相互切磋硏究學術原理，發表各人理想經騐，以融合補救各人學　上之，偏見。</p>
<p>今醫學刋物實屬過少，且規模不大，政府應予以獎勵津貼，以求雜聽刊物普遍，此於醫學上及人民健　上大有裨。</p>
<p>審定醫學書籍，藉學書　須經過敎靑部審定，方准出版，至於巳出版者亦須加以檢閱，以免學生為醫沉睡之偏見者所誤</p>
<p>以上七條，不過略述其大概而已，醫學　業，關於人民生命健義，民族國家之健仝與否，亦莫不</p>
<p>由此而道其萬一，還祈海內國醫同志，加以敎正，不勝企盼之至！</p>

<p>上海幼幼敎養院，近因物價繼漲增高，經費支出激增，維　困難。該院收容有兒童三百名，最近兩月來兄童　養費每名每月需二百五十元以上，與上半年用費比較幾近一笛有餘，故該院近正　備　寡中，擬聘請社會熱心人士擔任募捐。</p>

<p>金風送爽，王　　秋，在這淸　的李　中一年一度的中秋範，又憶降將臨到人間了，長空一碧，萬里淸　，這良辰美景，正是人們賞月　樂的好機會。</p>
<p>應着這佳節而起的是一吃「月餅」，吃月餅本來算不了一囘事：可是到了現在，因受了了物價的　戟，月餅也成為一種不平凡的食品了，這幾天來，在各食品店，百貨公句的玻璃櫥窗裏，陳列若各式的廣東月餅，蘇式月餅，每只的代價，普通是在五十元左右，這數目抵得了戰前的六担米！</p>
<p>上海多的是有錢人，月包價錢就是漲到不能想象的地步，也仍舊會有人去照願，但看這幾天食品店門前的生意興旺，就可知道消費者仍舊沒有减少</p>
<p>「送節禮」是中國向有的傳統「習慣」，和「節賞」，「小　」等價　，同樣有牢不可破的頑　性，每年消耗在這　酬　上的，如果加以統計，　目必定驚人。</p>
<p>「月兒彎彎照九洲，幾家歎樂幾家愁」，　團樂天儈，欣賞　月兒團　的常兒，我們轉念到　頭的許多流浪兒童，在嗷嗷待哺的掙扎下，是過着怎樣的生活，他們沒有家庭，沒有父母，沒有衣，　沒有吃，什麽佳節，　他們是毫不相開，但他們問樣是人，同樣育生存的權利，祇是遭遇的不幸吧了，眼看着這批被　棄在街頭的弱小的一羣，因受不住生活的重樣，一個個在無聲無息中摧殘了他們的小生命，這是多麽殘酷一的人間　劇啊！</p>
<p>於此我們敬求在嚼着數百元一只月餅的當　們，可憐可憐這些不幸者，發點同情心出來，節省下幾隻月餅錢，來救救這些小生命吧！不要以為餓死是人家的事，吃月餅是自已的權利，須知道人類根本是在同　互助上生存的</p>
<p>一幼吾幼以及人之幼」，發揮博愛的精神，來自動自發的救濟，捐助，或認贊，或輸款，量力而行，並期其普遍，能救濟於人的，得益者不僅是人，於己更有莫大的益處，如果入人皆這樣做，那末，衆　易舉，行見街頭的流浪兒童，將不再遭遇過去的厄運了。（天行）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Central Personnel Changes <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The recent decision by the Supreme National Defense Council to transfer Chen Qun to the position of Governor of Jiangsu Province, Mei Siping to the position of Minister of the Interior, and Chen Junhui to the position of Minister of Industry, marks a significant reshuffling of central personnel. We sincerely look forward to the actual results of these personnel changes. We have twice expressed our views and offered some suggestions regarding the future of Jiangsu's provincial administration. We now wish to add further remarks and contribute some ideas to the future work of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>It has become commonplace since the Republic of China for regional officials to be unruly, and for central government orders to fail to extend beyond the capital. Unfortunately, Jiangsu has recently followed this path. Although the central government has had to make concessions in personnel matters, the people have suffered from inconsistent policies, leaving them feeling lost and easily caught in the net of the law, a situation that is both laughable and regrettable. Furthermore, both domestic and foreign public opinion has criticized this state of affairs, which has damaged the government's credibility. The new Governor of Jiangsu, Chen Qun, while serving as Minister of the Interior, personally witnessed the failure of central government orders to be implemented in nearby regions, and his frustration must have been even greater than ours. Now that Chen has been transferred externally, he will surely be keenly aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the situation and will lead by example, taking the lead in complying with central laws and regulations, and changing the prevailing trend of provinces acting independently. In wartime, the country relies more than ever on iron discipline to maintain social order and stability. To make the people abide by discipline, it is especially important to start with government officials abiding by discipline. Jiangsu, due to its political, economic, cultural, and geographical relationships, holds a leading position among the provinces, and every action of its provincial administration has a significant impact on the perceptions of other provinces. Chen has a background in law, emphasizes laws and regulations, and adheres to discipline, which is a characteristic of legal experts who are consistent in word and deed. Therefore, we repeatedly emphasize this as our farewell message to Chen upon his assumption of office.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mei Siping was known for his management of the Jiangning Experimental County before the incident. A county is the prototype of a country, and county administration is a part of national interior affairs. Although county administration and national interior affairs differ in scope, their methods of handling are essentially the same. Only with a well-managed interior can people's livelihoods be stable. Only with stable livelihoods can we talk about various economic construction issues. The biggest reason for the instability of people's livelihoods in China in recent years is that the vast majority of local officials, instead of protecting the people, have oppressed and exploited them, making life unbearable for the people. How can we even begin to talk about production and construction? We hope that after taking office, Mei will first pay attention to the issue of official corruption. Strict standards must be set for the selection of county magistrates and district chiefs, and there must be absolutely no leniency based on personal relationships or the individual's past history. The evaluation of county magistrates and district chiefs should be strict rather than lenient, and would rather be wrong than let go. Those who have solid evidence of corruption and abuse of the people should be immediately punished as they deserve, and the punishment should be announced nationwide, so that those who intend to flout the law will be warned and fearful, and dare not try it lightly again. Only then can there be hope for political clarity and stable livelihoods. We have many expectations for Mei's reform of the interior, but what we are proposing today is the main point of the premise. If the main point cannot be resolved, all other issues will be nothing more than circuitous talk that neglects the fundamental and pursues the trivial.</p>
<p>The path to China's economic revival lies in increasing production and revitalizing industry, and the key to this lies with the Ministry of Industry. Although Chen Junhui is a newcomer to the party-state, we have heard that he has great vision, youthful vigor, and pure integrity, and has always retained the true colors of a scholar. Using him to promote economic construction and preside over economic administration will surely achieve consistency between words and deeds. We hope that Chen will maintain his consistent spirit of courage and progress, and accomplish the following points in the shortest possible time:</p>
<p>Increasing production cannot be achieved through empty words. First, there must be a plan, and second, it must be put into practice. Chen has proposed various production increase plans in the past, and we hope that he will now conduct a comprehensive review of them. Those that are feasible should be implemented immediately and completed within a set time limit. Those that are not feasible should be re-planned by experts. In short, there must be a spirit of doing what is said for all production increase plans, and we must not let the years go by and the result is still just words on paper.</p>
<p>Economic administrative institutions have the most opportunities to connect with agriculture, industry, and commerce. Whether or not personnel are used appropriately is greatly related to the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce. All the measures taken by economic institutions at the central, provincial, and municipal levels in the past, especially in terms of personnel, deserve deep reflection by the authorities. Chen is capable and diligent, but being upright and honest alone is not enough to run the national economic administration. It is not enough to only lead by example and be personally honest and clean, it is even more important to subtly influence and cultivate a good atmosphere.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of prices depends on supply and demand, which is known to everyone. The reasons why supply and demand cannot be balanced are that the output of a certain product is insufficient, transportation is difficult, and the market has insufficient inventory. Another is hoarding and monopoly. In recent years, the reason for the sharp rise in prices is mostly the latter, as evidenced by the number of cotton yarn registrations in Shanghai this time. Hoarding merchants disturb prices, which is hateful. However, economic administrative institutions have turned a blind eye to this beforehand, nurturing hidden dangers. Once measures are taken after the fact, it inevitably causes even greater social unrest. We hope that local economic administrative institutions will be responsible for actively correcting and preventing price issues and other economic problems in various places at any time, rather than passively seeking remedial measures after serious phenomena have already formed.</p>
<p>In recent years, the insurance industry in Shanghai has developed abnormally, with more than a hundred insurance companies established one after another. It is said that many of them lack sufficient capital. Regardless of whether their investments are safe, the more dispersed the expenses, the greater the expenses. This also weakens the protection for policyholders. In order to lay the foundation for our country's insurance industry, we should immediately use the method of raising the amount of capital to urge mergers and closely supervise operations.</p>
<p>Regarding the dividends from the Chinese shares of the various companies operated by the Central China Development Company, it is said that because the owners have not claimed them, they have all been handed over to the Ministry of Industry for collection. Over the years, the accumulated amount is not small. At a time when domestic industries need funds for development and banks have a shortage of deposits and are unable to lend, the above deposits should be settled with principal and interest, and redeposited in reliable domestic banks, and stipulated to be lent at low interest rates to various people's livelihood enterprises, specifically for increasing production.</p>
<p>In addition, Chen recently returned from a visit to Japan, and must have gained deep insights into Japan's wartime economic construction. We hope that Chen can use what he has observed, and taking into account the domestic situation of manpower and material resources, quickly formulate a comprehensive economic construction plan and do his utmost to promote its realization.</p>

<h3 id="e2">German Paratroopers Rescue Mussolini from Danger; Mussolini Arrives in Germany; Will Lead the Organization of a New Fascist Government <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) It is reported that Mussolini has arrived in Germany under the protection of the German army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) The German Leader's headquarters announced on the 12th: German paratroopers and SS security forces actively carried out rescue operations on the 12th to rescue Commander Mussolini, who had been arrested by traitorous elements. As a result, Commander Mussolini is now free. The Badoglio regime's attempt to hand over the commander to the Anglo-Americans has failed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) The German Leader's headquarters issued a special communiqué at 2200 hours on the 12th: Commander Mussolini has been rescued by the German army, but the location of the rescue and other details have not yet been announced. The whereabouts of Mussolini have been unknown since he attended the Fascist Grand Council on July 24. There have been almost 50 days without any news about Mussolini in the communiqués. However, according to news from the German Foreign Ministry, Mussolini went to meet King Victor Emmanuel III at his private residence on the morning of July 25 after attending the Fascist Grand Council. On his way back, he was arrested by the Badoglio regime and taken to a gendarmerie camp. In early September, he was transferred to the Colacius Key Fortress near Rome. Later, it was rumored that he was transferred to Ponza Island in the Bay of Italy. However, in this armistice agreement, handing over Mussolini to the Anglo-Americans was an important condition. Therefore, Reuters reported that Commander Mussolini had been taken to North Africa. But now, Mussolini, the leader of the Fascist National Revolution, has reappeared after being rescued by German paratroopers and will play an active role in international politics as the leader of the Italian Fascist National Government. It is rumored that the new Fascist government is planned to be organized by the former Fascist Party Secretary Farinacci, the Minister of Cultural Propaganda Pavolini, and Mussolini's son Vittorio as the highest administrative organ. Now that the head of the new government, Commander Mussolini, has made a comeback, it will be of great help to the new government. Moreover, the American puppet regime headed by Badoglio has been barely surviving since it announced its surrender, due to the speed of the German army's operations and the separation of the Italian people's hearts.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) Authoritative sources in London say that Mussolini was never detained by the anti-Axis forces. He was not in the hands of the anti-Axis forces when he was rescued by the German army. Therefore, the rumor that Mussolini was detained in Sicily is unfounded. London has not been tracking Mussolini's whereabouts.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) A Reuters reporter said that Mussolini's rescue was the bravest and most amazing event of the war. Hitler was extremely satisfied with the success of this plan. The reporter speculated that this event occurred in a small town in Sicily near Palermo. After Mussolini was rescued from danger, he was flown to Italian soil. The political effects of this move are quite significant, especially its impact on the Balkans, because Mussolini's rescue is not only a daring act, but also shows that those who are loyal to Germany are also loyal to Germany.</p>

These British troops attempted to attack from the north and northeast of the port, but were attacked by the German army. Due to the unfavorable terrain, they have been forced to switch to trench warfare, waiting for reinforcements.

<p>Lisbon, 12th – Central News Agency – According to a Reuters diplomatic commentator from London, Marshal Badoglio informed the British government in mid-August that Italy was willing to join the Allies as soon as they landed. The commentator stated that this information was obtained from authoritative British sources, adding that Lisbon was the center of this drama, and its protagonists were the British Ambassador to Portugal, Campbell, and an Italian general whose name was kept secret. In the first week of August, about a week after the fall of the Mussolini government, Italian diplomats in two neutral countries, under orders from the new government, contacted British representatives and explained Italy's desperate situation. The second Italian representative said he was under orders from Marshal Badoglio to discuss the possibility of an armistice, to which the British replied that only unconditional surrender could be accepted by the Allies. In mid-August, an Italian general with full powers from Badoglio sought a meeting with the British Ambassador to Spain, Hoare, in Madrid, and the next day met with Ambassador Campbell, stating that if the Allies landed in Italy, the Italian government was prepared to join the Allies in resisting the German army. This information was immediately notified to the British government, and relayed to the American, Soviet governments, and General Eisenhower. The terms of the Anglo-American cessation of hostilities to Italy were as follows: Italy would surrender unconditionally and accept all the conditions imposed by the Allies. The Italian general should immediately take the Allied conditions back to Rome, this clause was limited to military nature, and later other political and economic conditions were put forward, which the Italian government could not refuse. The Italian representatives were also informed that the actions of the Italian army would affect the implementation of the Allied terms, and great expectations were placed on the extent to which the Italian army and the people would assist the Allies. After General Eisenhower announced a military peace, the Italian government should immediately make the same announcement. The Italian general returned to Rome as scheduled. Badoglio sent another Italian general to Lisbon to prove Italy's sincerity. The Italian government released the captured British General Gascoigne and sent him along with the Italian representative with a reply to Lisbon and then to General Eisenhower's headquarters in Algiers. The reply stated that the Italian government would not declare military peace until the Allies landed their main force in Italy. In fact, the armistice agreement was signed on September 3rd, and the Soviet government and the dominion governments were kept closely informed.</p>
<p>German Authorities Reveal Truth About Italy's Betrayal</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th – Central News Agency – The German Foreign Ministry issued the following statement on the 11th regarding the acts of betrayal by Italian King Victor Emmanuel III and Badoglio: Dr. Rahn, the German Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, met with Italian Foreign Minister Guariglia on September 1st and telegraphed the German government, stating that Badoglio was still determined to assist Germany in continuing the war and would never surrender. Therefore, he (Rahn himself) would mobilize the main force to assist the Italian military in realizing its determination and promote close cooperation between the German and Italian armies. German Chargé d'Affaires Rahn reported to the German government on September 3rd that Marshal Badoglio had met with him today. Badoglio explained to him that although Italy seemed to be wavering due to the enemy's landing in Calabria, the Italian government believed that it could still completely control the hearts and minds of the Italian people and the army, which was the most powerful guarantee. Marshal Badoglio then asked him to trust them, saying that it was inappropriate for him to have doubts about them. Badoglio also said that although the Italian people sought peace, they were determined to continue fighting and would never surrender. Badoglio, having achieved his goal of seeking his trust, bid farewell to him with an exaggerated attitude. It should be noted that on the day Badoglio made these statements to him, he had already signed the surrender agreement with the Allies. Rahn reported after meeting with Italian Chief of Defense Staff General Ambrosio on the 4th that General Ambrosio had said that it was inappropriate for Germany to distrust the alliance between the German and Italian armies. Ambrosio also said with great sincerity that the war should be carried out jointly by Germany and Italy, and that he would exchange views with the German military authorities, and asked him to convey his views to the German military authorities. He believed that Ambrosio's determination to continue the war should not be doubted. The Italian King had received Chargé d'Affaires Rahn. Dr. Rahn telegraphed the German government about the audience, stating that King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy had inquired about the general military situation during his first audience. The Italian King seemed very concerned about the war situation on the front line and expressed great admiration for the German army's military discipline, organization, equipment, and offensive spirit. Regarding the Italian situation, the Italian King expressed the hope that the German government would trust the Badoglio government and the goodwill and sincerity of the Italian army. Thanks to the sincere cooperation of the German army in the past few days, the German army believed that it would soon be able to achieve a satisfactory victory. The Italian King also affirmed that Italy would never surrender and was confident that the current difficulties would be overcome in the future. Badoglio was a brave old general, and he believed that after twenty years of humiliation, the time had come for him to come forward again. He also said that he had forced the government to completely remove the leftist elements, and finally reiterated that the Italian government was determined to cooperate with Germany, endure all difficulties, and complete the war to the end. The Italian King made this statement at noon on the 8th. Unexpectedly, the American military authorities announced that afternoon that Italy had surrendered and had signed the surrender on the 2nd of this month. After hearing the American broadcast of the Italian surrender at 5:45 PM on the 8th, the German Chargé d'Affaires telephoned Italian Chief of Staff Roatta to inquire about the veracity of the news. Roatta replied that this broadcast from New York was British insulting false propaganda and was absolutely unbelievable. The German Chargé d'Affaires then telegraphed Italian Foreign Minister Guariglia's representative, Ambassador Rosso, whose reply was the same. Italian Foreign Minister Guariglia summoned the German Chargé d'Affaires to visit around 7 PM on the 8th. The German Chargé d'Affaires reported on the meeting, stating that Foreign Minister Guariglia had met with him on the afternoon of the 8th and stated that Marshal Badoglio had no other good strategy except to ask the Allies for a truce because the military situation was hopeless. Therefore, he was informing the German Ambassador. He replied that their actions seemed to be a violation of the treaty and an act of betrayal, and he would lodge a strong protest. He immediately replied that the Italian King had told him the other day that Italy was determined to abide by the alliance and cooperate with Germany to continue the war, and Marshal Badoglio had also made the same remarks. He now knew the value of the Italian King's and Badoglio's words. According to the above report from Chargé d'Affaires Rahn, it can be seen that the Italian King and his confidants deceived the German government.</p>

The Japanese army and navy air forces and ground troops immediately engaged them, launching a fierce air battle, shooting down five enemy (B24) planes (one of which is unconfirmed) and two (B/25) planes. Land artillery also shot down two enemy (B/25 type planes) and severely damaged two (B/25 type planes), the remaining planes fled.

Therefore, excluding the two heavily damaged planes, the enemy lost 9 planes and 75 airmen. With the war situation in the southwestern Pacific in a stalemate, the enemy attempted to contain the Japanese army and disrupt the Japanese rear from the northern Pacific with guerrilla warfare. After the Japanese army withdrew from Kiska Island, the enemy strengthened its air base in the Aleutian Islands, looking for a good opportunity to invade, hence this foolish attempt to bomb the northern Kuril Islands. However, the Japanese army's defense was strong, causing the enemy to fail and having 11 planes shot down resulting in great losses.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 13th – Central News Agency – The draft of the talk by the new Jiangsu Governor Chen Qun issued by Musha on the 12th, according to Chen's oral account, now collated by Chen himself: There are some discrepancies in the recorded wording, so it is recorded as follows: I have been ordered by the government to govern Jiangsu, and at this critical time, I really have no policy direction to speak of. Now, I would like to offer my immediate feelings: The people of Jiangsu are in dire straits after the war. After taking office, I will gradually improve everything and seek to stabilize the people's lives and bring them out of the water and fire. However, it is not something that can be done overnight, but I will absolutely not make the situation worse. Under the unified organization of the central government, all local policies should naturally be in accordance with the central government's intentions and absolutely accept the orders, supervision, and guidance of the central government. Important matters related to the Executive Yuan and various competent ministries should be submitted for instructions and complied with separately. I will not make major personnel changes in the provincial government after taking office. Government employees serve the country, not individuals. The appointment of personnel is always in accordance with the central government's intentions and depends on whether their experience and learning can be competent. Taking the position of county magistrate as an example, because they are officials who are close to the people, in the future, when there are vacancies, they must be people who have served as county magistrates with achievements or at least have worked in local administrative agencies for more than two years to be selected. National tax revenue must be returned to the national treasury bit by bit to enrich the national finances and must not be arbitrarily misappropriated. I also plan to request the central government to implement a budget system. Local revenue and expenditures are planned to be extended to local impartial gentlemen. At any time to add guidance. The highest supervision and guidance of local police will be implemented by the Ministry of Interior, as the position and experience of the minister of interior for several years. It is considered that the Ministry of Interior must carry out its functions to achieve the effect of police unification. The date of taking office has not yet been determined. I will take office as soon as the Ministry of Interior completes the handover.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 13th – Central News Agency – According to dispatches from London, the Polish government-in-exile held a national conference on the afternoon of the 13th. Foreign Minister Romer clarified Poland's foreign policy and solemnly declared on relations with the Soviet Union: The Polish government hopes to establish a completely fair understanding with the Soviet Union on the basis of mutual recognition of rights and interests, and hopes that the Soviet government will not only allow Poles in the Soviet Union to exercise their political rights, but also allow them to leave the country from a humanitarian point of view. Since the Soviet Union and Poland are continuing to fight a common enemy, it is not convenient to raise the issue of demarcating the borders between the two countries at this time. One thing must be said, that the Polish government insists on the territorial integrity of its country on that day.</p>

It is also learned that the Shanghai District Daily Development Office of the Beibu Post Office has paid 4,000 kilograms of Zhongchu Bonds, and each person can only remit 80 yuan of Zhongchu Bonds per day. Calculated at the exchange rate of 18 yuan of Zhongchu Bonds to Lianhe Bonds, if the remittance of 4,000 yuan of Zhongchu Bonds is completed before the end of the month, it must be postponed to the next month.</p>

<p>Datong News Agency: The Baojia authorities in various districts have found that most of the residents who have been guaranteed recently are minors under the age of 20. Thinking that this approach is inappropriate, a new method has been specifically stipulated: Those who provide guarantees must be adults over the age of 21. As for the market owners who have handled this provision, they have already been notified by the Baojia authorities to change it; otherwise, their market certificate or residence permit will be revoked.</p>

<h3 id="e32">First District Public Office Revises Rules for Collection of Entertainment Tax <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Shanghai Special Municipality First District Public Office issued a notice yesterday regarding the rules for theaters, cinemas, and other entertainment venues to pay entertainment tax and issue or reissue admission tickets. The revised rules are as follows:</p>
<p>All seating within the halls of theaters, cinemas, and other entertainment venues, which are available for use by audience members, must be numbered (except for venues holding continuous performances). Three identical copies of a seating chart showing the exact location of each seat must be submitted to the Finance Department, Donations and Taxes Division, Room 209, Jiangxi Road.</p>
<p>Adding any seats within the venue, beyond the seating shown on the approved seating chart, is strictly prohibited. However, this does not apply to police stations and fire departments performing their duties.</p>
<p>Each performance may only sell the number of admission tickets approved by this office.</p>
<p>Each admission ticket must be sequentially numbered, and each ticket must be perforated into three parts, each part clearly marked with the ticket number, seat number (except for continuous performance venues), performance date and time, and the entertainment tax stamp of this office.</p>
<p>Tickets for regular performances must be submitted to the Donations and Taxes Division of this office for stamping at least ten days in advance. Tickets for special or additional performances must be stamped at least four days in advance.</p>
<p>The entertainment tax stamp of this office must be affixed to the reverse side of each admission ticket across the seam between the first and second sections, the seam between the second and third sections, and in the center of the third section.</p>
<p>Stamped admission tickets may not be altered without prior approval from this office.</p>
<p>The second and third sections of the admission tickets should be given to the ticket purchaser. Upon entering the venue, the purchaser should retain all three sections and hand over the second section at the entrance to the hall. Each entertainment venue should retain the first section of the admission ticket along with any unsold tickets for inspection by this office.</p>
<p>All tickets torn from the first section will be considered sold. Unsold tickets that have been stamped must be returned to this office by the third day of the month following the month in which they were originally intended to be sold.</p>
<p>Venues that issue complimentary tickets must ensure that ticket holders exchange their complimentary tickets for formal admission tickets subject to the entertainment tax at the ticket sales office.</p>
<p>Licensees of theaters, cinemas, and other entertainment venues must submit the total entertainment tax collected to the Donations and Taxes Division at the end of each month, or on a date specified in a separate notice. They must also submit two copies of a detailed receipt list prepared on the provided blank reporting forms. Blank reporting forms can be obtained from the Donations and Taxes Division.</p>
<p>The account books of each entertainment venue must be available for inspection by personnel dispatched by this office, who may also inspect all admission tickets, regardless of whether they bear the entertainment tax stamp of this office, and may verify tickets by checking with the audience members when necessary.</p>
<p>The above rules apply to all entertainment venues, including storytelling venues. They also include tickets sold separately within the venue for separate entertainment.</p>
<p>Licensees who violate the above rules will be subject to a fine not exceeding five thousand yuan by this office.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Seven things are essential for daily life: firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea." The importance of salt is no less than that of rice and oil. The authorities, always concerned for the well-being of the people, have provided household rice, household flour, household bread, and coarse grains. However, there has been no household salt purchase certificate, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>The official fixed price of salt used to be 1.25 yuan per jin (approximately 0.5 kg), but has recently increased to 1.65 yuan. However, residents cannot obtain even a grain of this salt at the fixed price. The salt sold by vendors and profiteers in the hands of ordinary citizens is expensive, often making one feel a "great hope for prosperity."</p>
<p>Shanghai is very close to salt-producing areas. There is Haizhou to the north, Daishan and Yuyao to the south, and Jinshan in the middle. Yet, there is a salt shortage. Residents must eat expensive salt that is beyond expectations. What about residents in inland, salt-deficient areas such as Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Anhui provinces? People in Hunan use chili peppers to substitute for salt due to the high cost. If salt remains expensive for a long time, people in Shanghai will imitate those in Hunan, eating more chili peppers, only increasing irritation!</p>
<p>In fact, our coastal area has always been known as a land of fish and salt. Residents have always regarded salt as readily available as air. Now, it is so expensive, which is truly unheard of. If the authorities can solve the difficulties of Shanghai citizens and widely sell inexpensive household salt, perhaps one jin per person per month, as an assumed amount, would not be too difficult.</p>

After the National Government implemented the purchase of cotton yarn in Shanghai, the Tianjin cotton yarn market was affected and showed a downward trend. Most people are waiting and seeing. Few customers have been asking questions, and there have only been sporadic transactions. According to a person in charge of the industry, sales in the Tianjin yarn market in recent months have only been about 100 pieces. Although prices have been lowered repeatedly, there are few inquiries.</p>

<h3 id="e48">The Fifth Year of the Great War: Europe's Destiny Enters a Decisive Period <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The progress of the war increasingly reveals the true nature of this great war. This nature can no longer be dealt with by alliances or power plays. This is the labor pain before the birth of a new Europe. But what is becoming clearer is that Europe will be formed by two major forces. One is Central Europe led by Germany, and the other is Eastern Europe that the Soviet Union wants to lead.</p>
<p>The Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Sedan</p>
<p>The large-scale war on the Eastern Front that will determine the fate of Europe can be described as unprecedented in history. Although the victor is yet to be decided, generally speaking, it is entering its fifth year. This can be seen as a decisive period. The Battle of Stalingrad is often compared with the Battle of Sedan. The Battle of Sedan not only determined the fate of Napoleon III and France, but also had a decisive effect on the fate of Europe. Because of the Battle of Sedan, European hegemony shifted from Paris to Berlin. But the victory that decided it was not merely Bismarck's genius over Napoleon III's warmongering, but the result of historical development.</p>
<p>The economic power of the German people and Central Europe far exceeds that of Western Europe. This is a fact. France relied on the aid of Britain and the United States to win a temporary victory in the First World War and gained nominal European hegemony, but nothing changed fundamentally. The Battle of Stalingrad may be a symbol of the shift of European hegemony to the East! The counter-offensive at Stalingrad was indeed very fierce, but we should remember that this counter-offensive penetrated deep into Soviet territory, and only one German division was annihilated there. The full strength of the German army that entered enemy territory was not defeated. If either side of the German and Soviet armies, which are facing each other along thousands of kilometers, collapses, then the undefeated side can be regarded as the builder of Europe in the future. Therefore, we can understand here that Europe will not be dominated by the United States or Britain, but by a strong nation within the continent. But although Britain is a country outside the circle, it still has some residual elements on the continent.</p>
<p>British and American Wishful Thinking to Occupy Europe for a Long Time</p>
<p>In fact, Britain and the United States are using all means to block this historical development, and are aiding many exiled governments in the hope of reviving outdated power balances and alliance policies. But these exiled governments are far removed from reality, so aiding them cannot create history. The "Times" plan to divide Europe into the spheres of influence of the Soviet Union and Britain has been eliminated by the Soviet Union's declaration. This is a mistake of the nineteenth century. The policy of unconditional occupation and the implementation of military administration in the occupied territories proves that Britain has no constructive ideas other than old imperialism. Britain and the United States want to occupy Europe for a long time in order to re-educate the European people with democracy.</p>
<p>European Hegemony Belongs to Either the Soviet Union or Germany</p>
<p>It is evidence that neither the Soviet Union nor the United States can hope that the people will support imperialist policies. On the contrary, the Soviet Union's policy is aimed at winning people's hearts. After four years of war, the suffering of the people is increasing, especially with the air raids by Britain and the United States, large cities are now in a state of chaos. The middle class has declined due to wartime mobilization, causing European society to lose the pillar that supports the European social order. If Europe does not obtain a new order through Germany's victory, it will be brought under the rule of the Soviet regime through the victory of the Soviet Union. No labor can change this historical development. Britain and the United States still want to stop this trend and cause Germany and the Soviet Union to suffer mutual defeats. From this point of view, one can understand the truth of the Quebec Conference. At the Quebec Conference, it was decided not to complete the second front demanded by the Soviet Union this year. Britain and the United States are about to devote greater efforts to the East Asian front. Because Britain and the United States fear that if the European war ends before the East Asian war, the Soviet Union will be in a more favorable position against Britain and the United States. Therefore, before the European war is over, Britain and the United States intend to attack Japanese military positions with their increased forces. The vicious Britain and the United States hope that Germany and the Soviet Union will fight to the death in the Eastern War and end up in mutual defeat. At the same time, they want to take the opportunity to destroy the Japanese army. This new policy of Britain and the United States is bound to infuriate the Soviet Union. As a result, political disputes have arisen between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the war has entered a critical stage both militarily and politically. The new history created by the European War and the Great East Asian War will be definitely unfolding in the fifth year of the war.</p>
<p>Germany Prepares for British and American Landings and Shortens Front Lines</p>
<p>Since the Soviet Union began its offensive in the first quarter of this year, the number of tanks and aircraft deployed on the Eastern Front has been very large. In short, although the Soviet Union has received a considerable amount of weapons from Britain and the United States, most of these weapons are not supplied by Britain and the United States. They cannot hesitate. It is feared that Stalin has taken a desperate gamble in this major offensive. The combat strength of the Soviet army should not be underestimated, but it has probably reached its limit. In the Soviet army's large-scale counter-offensive, the most important issue for Germany is to shorten the long front lines as much as possible and make them a strong defense line. Military experts in Stockholm, Sweden, say that the best way for Germany now is to organize and shorten the defense lines on the Eastern Front as much as possible to prepare for the Axis forces to land in Western Europe, or that Stalin is determined to demand a second front because he has learned that Britain and the United States will never carry out a large-scale war. Stalin understands that if Britain and the United States dare to land in Western Europe, their forces will step onto the European continent, so he certainly does not want this kind of operation to succeed. This is Stalin's true intention.</p>
<p>Difficult to Fill the Gap Between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>But on the British side, if they do not agree to the Soviet Union's demands, then the gap between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union will never be filled, and they will only waste time on pointless discussions. Moreover, no matter what they say, if a large-scale landing operation in Western Europe does not take place, then the current war situation will not reach a decisive stage. And when implementing this kind of large-scale war, Britain and the United States seem to have no choice but to cooperate closely. But the United States is constrained in the Pacific by its number one enemy, Japan. Therefore, the United States does not want to sacrifice its strongest troops on the European front. The United States' weapons production capacity is extremely strong, but there is a limit to its human resources. Therefore, Roosevelt advocates using his elite troops mainly for the war against Japan. Churchill is caught in the crossfire between Roosevelt and Stalin and has to properly arrange both the European theater and the Pacific theater. (Source: Tokyo Mainichi Newspaper, September 1st)</p>

<p>The Chinese cigarette factories in this city once showed a prosperous scene, but later, some factories were destroyed by fire, and the industry plummeted. According to reporters' investigation, at present, among the Chinese cigarette factories, only Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, Guan Xin, and Da Dong are slightly larger in scale, and there are not many other small ones. Recently, due to the limited supply of raw materials, the production scene has been further reduced compared to before. According to the latest statistics on cigarette production, British and American cigarettes account for more than 50%, Japanese cigarettes account for slightly less than 40%, and Chinese cigarettes account for only 7%.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Suggestions for Improving Traditional Chinese Medicine <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Zemin</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are different and each has its own advantages. However, Western medicine has made many inventions while traditional Chinese medicine has stagnated. There are three reasons for this:</p>
<p>Lack of creative and reformist spirit. Traditional Chinese doctors often stick to established formulas without thinking of changing them. It must be understood that academics are progressive. If the formulas used today are better than the ancient formulas, they should be changed accordingly.</p>
<p>Lack of research on physiology, anatomy, histology, and the use of instruments. Therefore, when the country encounters war, they cannot be sent to the front line to take on rescue work. When epidemics occur, there is a lack of proper emergency measures, which leads to being despised by the government.</p>
<p>The country is in trouble. Internal and external disturbances occur frequently. The country has never rewarded or promoted domestic medical affairs. There is a lack of funding and no proper organizational structure, which has led to insufficient progress in medicine.</p>
<p>Judging from these three major reasons, it is not without reason that traditional Chinese medicine is declining day by day. As early as 1928, the government decided to abolish traditional Chinese medicine. The traditional Chinese medical community was struck like a blow to the head. The first national conference of traditional Chinese medicine representatives was held that year to request the government to withdraw its order and improve traditional Chinese medicine. At this time, traditional Chinese doctors had a strong spirit. In recent years, medical research associations have sprung up all over the country, and there are many people dedicated to the transformation of traditional Chinese medicine. However, without the government's thorough promotion and the lack of organization and coordination in the traditional Chinese medical community, there has been little progress in improving traditional Chinese medicine. Now that this war is coming to an end and the construction period is about to begin, the medical industry should be no exception. I would like to briefly describe the methods for improving traditional Chinese medicine, so that traditional Chinese medical colleagues can learn from each other and provide great assistance to the government in improving traditional Chinese medicine. My suggestions are as follows:</p>
<p>Establish Traditional Chinese Medicine Specialized Schools</p>
<p>The government should establish general medical specialized schools in major cities and provincial capitals throughout the country to cultivate Chinese medical talents. It should hire professors who have considerable knowledge of medicine and divide them into various departments, with three-, four-, and five-year systems.</p>
<p>Doctors Must Pass Strict Examinations to Practice Medicine Students who have completed their studies at the school or at a doctor's office must undergo strict examinations by examiners specially appointed by the Ministry of Education to avoid quack doctors. Those who have already started practicing medicine must also go through the same examination procedure. Those who fail the examination should be excluded.</p>
<p>Adopt the Strengths of Foreign Medicine Western medicine and medical equipment have made contributions to medicine and should be adopted to make up for the shortcomings of traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Establish Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospitals Based on the organizational methods of Western medicine hospitals, traditional Chinese medicine hospitals should be established throughout the country to meet the needs of patients and learn from their strengths.</p>
<p>Strengthen Communication and Coordination Among the Medical Community Except for the National Medical Association and a few medical research societies, few traditional Chinese doctors participate in social activities, which affects the progress and innovation of medicine. Medical research societies should be established universally, and symposiums should be held from time to time to learn from each other and study academic principles, and to share personal ideas and experiences to integrate and remedy each other's academic prejudices.</p>
<p>There are too few medical publications now, and they are not large in scale. The government should provide rewards and subsidies to make these publications more common, which would be of great benefit to medicine and people's health.</p>
<p>Review and Approve Medical Books Medical books must be reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education before they can be published. Those that have already been published should also be reviewed to prevent students from being misled by the prejudices of those who are immersed in medical slumber.</p>
<p>The above seven points are just a brief description of the general ideas. The medical profession concerns the health and life of the people, and the health of the nation and the country.</p>
<p>This is just a small part of it. I hope that my colleagues in traditional Chinese medicine in the country will correct me. I am very hopeful!</p>

<h3 id="e53">Mid-Autumn Festival: This Office Hosts a Tea Party for the Elderly and Appeals for Street Children <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>This spring, this office held a symposium for the elderly in Jue Lin, and also initiated the Qiying Society in Chong Sheng Tang, uniting the elderly to discuss welfare and help the world in peace. At this time of chaos, we are happy to celebrate the festival. Colleagues invite the elders and scholars from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui who have taken refuge in the sea to a tea party at Fang Wen's personal exhibition venue to honor the elders, visit the books, and listen to the wonderful sounds. In the evening, we invite them to Gujiazhai Park to enjoy the moon and invite Elder Ding to teach longevity methods. Also, in order to practice the spirit of respecting the old and loving the young, this office has launched a pre-Mid-Autumn Festival donation campaign to help children. We hope that donors will save a little on their food and drink and donate enthusiastically to create immeasurable blessings.</p>
<p>Women's Association Maternity Fund Limited to Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association raised more than 10,000 yuan by selling flowers made by members on the 38th Women's Day this year, and proposed 5,000 yuan to organize a maternity fund. No one has applied for it in the past six months. Yesterday, we received a letter from the person in charge of the association saying that because the amount is limited, it is only available to members and cannot benefit the public, which is a pity. This newspaper has already specially contracted with Hongren, Ximen, and Pingmin, the three major hospitals for the poor, and female teachers in primary and secondary schools. If they are unable to afford childbirth, they can apply to this office.</p>
<p>Free Schools and Scholarships</p>
<p>Tuition is waived at the Juanguang Free Night School. The level ranges from first grade of elementary school to sixth grade. There are still quotas available for junior and senior high school levels. Registration is open from now until September 19th from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM every night. The school address is No. 7 Lianji Lane, next to the Xinxin Theater, Jing'an Temple Road, Haig Road.</p>
<p>The Guanqun Free Tutoring School branch at 1014 Xinle Road (near the Gujia Garden) originally had insufficient scholarship funds for distribution. It is now heard that the school has specially added unlimited semi-tuition and scholarship quotas in order to commend poor students. All those who are confirmed to be from poor families after investigation can be approved. It is also heard that the school is scheduled to officially start classes on the fifteenth of the month.</p>
<p>The Zhonghua Workers' Free School is enrolling students. Registration time is from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM every evening. Tuition is completely free. The school address is the Fourth Workers' Tutoring School on the third floor of the Dongpudong Building, Chengdu Road, Edward Road.</p>
<p>The Liqun Women's Free Tutoring School offers major subjects such as Chinese, Japanese, English, Mathematics, Bookkeeping, General Knowledge, and Home Economics. (Women from middle school levels who are from poor families and have ambitions for further study can enroll. Class time is from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Tuition is free. The address is the Zhende Middle School at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road, Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>The Xiuyu Free School is now enrolling students. Children from poor families are admitted free of charge, and fees are provided free of charge by the school. The school address is 15 Danshui Road.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Youyou Child Care Home to Begin Fundraising Soon <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Youyou Child Care Home has recently been facing increasing financial difficulties due to the continued rise in prices and increased expenditure. The home accommodates 300 children. In the past two months, the cost of raising each child has been more than 250 yuan per month, which is almost more than a flute compared to the cost in the first half of the year. Therefore, the home is preparing to start fundraising and plans to hire enthusiastic people from the community to serve as fundraisers.</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn Festival: Talking about the Street Children</p>
<p>The golden wind is refreshing, and the jade dew is autumn. In this clear sky and bright moon, the annual Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching. The long sky is clear, and the clear air is thousands of miles away. This is a good opportunity for people to enjoy the moon.</p>
<p>In response to this festival, one eats "moon cakes." Eating moon cakes was originally not a big deal, but now, due to the impact of prices, moon cakes have become an extraordinary food. In the past few days, various Cantonese moon cakes and Suzhou moon cakes have been displayed in the glass windows of food stores and department stores. The price of each cake is usually around 50 yuan, which is equivalent to six dan of rice before the war!</p>
<p>There are many rich people in Shanghai. Even if the price of moon cakes rises to unimaginable levels, there will still be people willing to pay for them. Judging from the booming business in front of food stores in the past few days, we can know that the number of consumers has not decreased.</p>
<p>"Sending festival gifts" is a traditional "custom" in China, and it has the same unbreakable obstinacy as "festival rewards" and "small favors." If the annual consumption on these entertainments is statistically analyzed, the numbers will be shocking.</p>
<p>"The moon is curved and shines on the nine continents, some families sigh with joy and some families worry." When we think of the happy people who are appreciating the round moon, we think of the many street children who are struggling to feed themselves. What kind of life are they living? They have no families, no parents, no clothes, and no food. What festival is it? It has nothing to do with them, but they are still people and have the right to survive. They are just experiencing misfortune. Watching these small groups of abandoned people on the streets, their small lives are being destroyed silently because they cannot bear the weight of life. What a cruel human tragedy!</p>
<p>Therefore, we respectfully ask those of you who are chewing on moon cakes worth hundreds of yuan to have pity on these unfortunate people, show some sympathy, save a few moon cake coins, and save these small lives! Don't think that starvation is someone else's business and eating moon cakes is your right. You must know that human beings fundamentally survive on mutual assistance.</p>
<p>"Love my young and extend it to the young of others." Develop a spirit of universal love and take the initiative to provide relief, donate, or sponsor. Do what you can and hope that it is universal. Those who can help others will not only benefit others, but also benefit themselves greatly. If everyone does this, then it will be easy for everyone to see that street children will no longer encounter the misfortune of the past. (Tianxing)</p>
