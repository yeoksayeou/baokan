<h3>游資出路兩條大道</h3>
<p>中日事變以後，各地資金紛紛向上海逃避，形成國內游資最大之集積地，集積於此之游資，自然不安於靜止，隨時找尋出路，其出路之目的，初時同爲保持自己資金之安全，並獲取微薄利潤，如存入銀行生息，小規模經營商業。其後游資愈聚愈多，而人之慾望，原無止境，漸漸企圖暴利之獲得。於是，趨向於外匯烚赤之投機，以至囤積居奇而操縱。一人有利，萬人蜂從。游資愈泛濫，投機事業愈旺盛，演變所屆，市塲混沌，畸形繁榮，物價奔騰，樂了少數，苦了大衆。</p>
<p>我們迥想近數年來整個上海社會，也可以說足以影饗全國各地，爲了游資泛濫，未能覔取正常歸宿途徑，而自由流竄的結果，攪得滿城風雨，迄無寗日。痛定思痛，今後將何以善籌吸收對策，正賴政府統籌領導於上，社會各界尤其是經濟界充分協力，以及人民大衆一致支援，通力合作，使游資不但不如洪水猛獸之爲患，而利用之成爲復興產業之生力軍。這個責任，已不容政府與人民相互諉卸，而將相互肩負策進了。</p>
<p>過去數年間，因爲環境複雜，局勢變幻莫定，而游資又最富敏感性，環顧形勢，認爲可靠而永久性的歸宿之途，絕無尋處，乃採取游竄圖利方略，逞倖一時，此種事實，自有其客觀因素以促成。時至今日，局勢大體判定，不致變幻莫測，而環境亦無複雜現象，所以，握有游資者，必須認淸此種事實，而更應放棄囤積貨物，以圖暴利的觀念。因爲此種做法，「黃金時代」已過，縱使囤積，以後決不會再有暴利可得。况且政府已有明文禁止，物資已有嚴密統制，何苦爲了「超過生活所需」的阿堵物，而甘願以身試法，甘願冒險從事，更何忍我獨樂而衆人苦。社會總有一天安定，國家總有一天復興，我又何苦做一個安定與復興中的罪人呢！或許有人抱着我雖不做而人家仍做，還是徒然的見解。此種見解，最要不得。一有此見解，凡百事物，無改善希望：凡百罪惡，即從此以起。我國國事之所以如此蜩螗者，即因同胞中抱此見解者大有人在的緣故，良可慨歎！所以，盼望持有游資者—包括個人與團體，從此以資金運用於正當途徑，把利潤的慾望降低些，而把國家社會的意識提高些。國家復興了。你們的資金才能眞正有了保障，可以享用，否則覆巢之下，決無完卵。滾滾而來者，又有何用呢！</p>
<p>我們上面似乎說了一大套的空話，其實，我們認爲必先從每個人心理上確立堅强的正確基礎，才做得到不只爲個人打算，而也爲國家社會打算的事。這裏我們舉出游資出路兩條大道：</p>
<p>第一，投放於國債，如國家發行之債券，獎券，儲蓄券等。國家因正當需要而對人民徵募費用，人民自有絕對應募之義務。一方面政府在事前自當慎重考慮用途之正當，與利益之保障，旣經決定之後，人民自當踴躍率從。如政府最近發行之福利獎券，糧食庫券等，前者爲獎勵人民儲蓄，可使通貨回流，節制膨脹，間接即所以抑制物價，安定民生。政府旣爲人民設想，人民自當爲政府支援。况國民儲蓄，爲國家調整財政有力之支柱。世界各國，國民儲蓄額最高之國家，即爲其國國民愛國情緒最高之國家，亦即團結力量最易發揮的國家。雖則儲蓄的利潤，不如投機的高；但是，國家的利益，比較個人的利益大。所以，盼望持有游資者，盡量投放於國債。</p>
<p>第二，投放於生產事業。生產事業範圍頗廣，種類如農業，工業，礦業等等，性質如國營，公營，私營等等，而不出乎國家的經濟建設範圍。於此，我們認爲政府應有整個經濟建設計劃，分門別類，按時按地，全國經濟委員會似應有此責任。一方面眼睜睜一任游資流於投機而咀咒之，一方面則不爲籌設歸宿途徑。這種咎責，實亦不必諉卸。至於方法，則很多，如由政府出面組織大規模企業公司，吸收游資，從事生產；如國營企業已辦有成績者，准許人民接辦或合辦，吸收游資，政府另行再辦；如獎勵協助人民設立大規模企業公司，吸收游資；如民營企業已有成績而尙須擴充者，製成計劃，公開徵集游資等等，均爲生產事業之可以吸收大量游資者。</p>
<p>總之，最爲可靠而永久性之游資出路，厥爲上述二途，而其中心，在於握有游資者，必須認識個人利益，與國家利益之孰重孰輕？不迷於暴利近利，不逞一已私慾，顧全大衆，顧全國家。同時，我們更盼望政府當局，重視游資之力量，而籌謀運用方策，以保障人民利益，袪除人民疑慮爲前提，以期此可觀之游資，不爲蠢害社會之癰患，而成穩固國家財政，與復興國家產業之巨大力量，庶則國家，社會，人民，交受其益，幸何如之！</p>

<h3>日海軍航空部隊　大舉進襲魯塞爾島　空戰結果擊落敵機四十九架</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日大本營本日下午五時發表：帝國海軍航空部隊七日會以戰鬥機大戰隊，進製魯塞爾島，（Rusell　Island在所羅門葉島之中部）常於該處上空與敵機壞遭遇，展開激烈空戰。結果擊落敵機四十九架，我機六架未返基地。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城九日中央社電據華盛頓電美海軍部八日發表公報稱：六日晨日有力航空部隊曾空襲魯塞爾島之美軍陣地，美戰鬥機於迎戰時喪失七架。</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電日海軍航察部隊前會獎擊察襲聖特蘭島之敵機某，擊落其中二十架，獲得偉大戰果。八日晨復以戰鬥機大隊，由某基地出發，強襲其重要基地魯塞爾島，敵機華展開近所未有之大空戰，結果擊落敵機四十九架，再獲莫大戰果。是日日機大編隊以誓滅敵人之滿腔鬥志，向敵軍根據地進發，在尚未到達魯塞爾島以前之途中，日機早在加資卡島上空段陣以待，故敵機飛來即成爲日機之好餌，轉瞬之間即擊落敵機八架。其後於日機至魯塞爾息敵軍荼地上空時，又與昇室迎戰之敵渥特西科爾斯基型（b4u）機，卡基斯型（p4o）機，巨人式（g3t）機等新銳戰鬥機展開强熙空戰，日機即再擊落敵機四十九架。其間日機力量猶綽有餘裕，乃猛炸敵方機塲格納庫等軍事設施，予以重創，是役日機六架未能飛返原防。關於此次空戰中之美方損害，美海軍部發表謂，僅喪失飛機七架，實爲其掩飾事實之慣技。故敵方極力宣傳其損害義少，亦適足以證明日本航空部隊空襲之猛烈。</p>

<h3>中日經濟協力之途（二）　統制經濟協力推進　勿使資本集中租界</h3>
<p>— 吳震修</p>
<p>租界和治外法權，是中國政治，經濟上的一大東縛，濟跡租界，託　治外法權而爲非作惡的罪行，這是衆區周知的中寶，當然租外也是生命，財產資本的最安全塲所，直到如今，尚有一部係華人在作此想，所以祗有租界有資太集中，也祗是有租界的地方成了肥土，上海，天津，廣束，廈門等處，都是如此，這稱偏在沿海地帶的發展，對於中國整個經儕可以說是畸形的發展。</p>
<p>現在實行收囘租界和治外法權、爲中國的政治的經潸發展計，實在可喜，而本人所　望者，也即在此。今後設有租界的沿海各都市，縱然瘦予些也不妨，因爲可使內地）是指對沿海部市的內地）各處發展，而內河沿岸或洽鐵道各地，都可以平術物資，同樣發達，今後的上海，當然還是統制中心的地位，漸漸發展，然而中國過去的經濟沒有發展，申國沒有健全的發展更不能從古老的國家發展爲新的闕家，進而爲近代國家。　　關於商統會的進展，最近我們在商量組織下層機構的各地方聯合會，我們對於商統會的運用當然儘方去做，可是前途很不容易。</p>
<p>第一，統制經濟在中國尙無前例，簡直毫無經騐，所謂統制知識，僅不過稍微研究了一點日本的東四，所以　們來做，總有些勉強，這次雖然因爲中日間的新政策而交給我們自辦　可是力最不到的地方，還得要請日本多方援助。　　第二，商統會四周的客觀絛件，未必能說　好，千句併一句說．申國的現狀，既無舊的機構，也沒有做成新的機構，這種狀熊的原因，不容諱言?是九一入，八一三，大東亞戰爭所造成的，而且數十年來．地士農工商制度之下。工業是原始式的，自從專以農業爲中心的舊機構時代起向一直到與外國通商時期，以迄現在爲止，中間不知有了貢許變化，在這種情形之下，一件新的重大工作，要想做成，決不是容易的，日本假使遭遇了這種傷合，還有辦法可想，然而中國方面就大感困雜了。</p>
<p>商統會的當前問題，就是如何統制上海的物資，我以爲遭個間題，假個在十二月入日大東亞戰爭爆發之後就收買上海的物資。情形就此較樂觀．可是十二月倣日之後，上梅的物賣都流到了民間．價符也大漲，而商統會卻在這很麻煩的時俠成立，這種情彩，希望日方也要想到。</p>
<p>上海的投機囤積，當然有嚴厲取締的必要，尤其像那些心圖暴利的囤積行爲，決不容許存在，假使單是檢舉一部份投機國積者非但不能根絕、反而產生相反的效果，上海人口有四百五才萬之多，其中做犬規模投機囤積的是極少數，我以爲對於這些人，除了他們生活必需外、而所有的物資，都歸商統曾，交給政府，先把這個意思和他們戀談，假使　你怎　說他們還是不允的話，那就請這個人離開上海這不是頂好的方法嗎？</p>
<p>在上海最必要的就是增加生意，關於這一點，已由日方移交同府接管的敵產，如果是中國民間經管適當者，應該及早交給民間人士來襅營，以便努力增加生產，雖然說是交給民間人士來做，要是叫一個沒許眞正經營事業經騐的人來幹，也是不中用的，</p>
<p>在軍中方面，已經緩和物資移動限制物資的統制事宜，歸中國自己來辦這是値得歡喜慼謝的，可是還有一個問題，就是華中和華北的物資文流的圓滑化，例如華北的食糧問越、我們就民生上營之，抱有極大關心，再如華中方面的煤價奇昂，而華北非常便實，諸如華北來貨，而華中來　這類情彩，決不是好現象，道種物價差別應該予以調整，然而·由於既往的華北華中間情形。要立　求共自由交易、勢不可能，我以爲先就兩，三種物資使其交流，看一看樣子，再加以調節，一步一步的做去。　　最後我再願意講一句，現柱的世上，都是如此，處於指導地位的人，總是遝樣想；「這個是還樣的緣故，要這樣做·因爲是必要的，是當然的，所以要這樣做」，例如從自由經濟·移轉到統制經濟，在目前是當然的事體，須要如此做，就公平的，地來論，我並不以爲做的人無理，可是，亦然就公半的見地來論，在受統制的方而，確有權困難的地方，商統會所盧的環境，也可以說是如此，所以凡百事件，總要考慮到指導者與被指導者，顧慮，到統制方面典　統制方面，以期萬全而公平。（雲鵬：譯自每日新聞　昨日第四版）</p>
<h3>東京舉行國民大會　發宣言促全國民衆奮起　完成護國將士未竟之志</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日本一億　國民於驚悉由本元帥壯烈火殉國及阿圖島日守軍全體就義之消息後，羣情憤激逹於極點。日大政翼贊會，翼政治會，東京市政府等，乃聯合發起舉行「擊減英美決戰國民大會」。東京方面國民大會在每日讀朝日三新聞社之贊助下，於九日下午二時假日比谷公會堂盛大舉行。行禮如儀後，由翼贊會副總裁後藤文夫捧讀認書，繼推舉翼政會總裁阿部信行大將爲大會主席後，即由翼政會議員會副會長松田竹千代氏朗讀大會宣言及決義文，經滿塲一致通過。旋由衆院　岡田議長及翼贊會總務部長下村宏氏相繼發表演說，鼓勵全國民衆，奮起發揚「擊　減英美而後已」之精神。直至下午二時四十五分始行散會。茲錄大會宣言大意如次：「自作戰開始以來，日軍所獲之光榮戰果，實足以永垂青史。惟建設大東亞之偉業，猶在開始之初，當此決戰時，目下實爲我舉國民衆集給盡忠報國之赤忱，以努力爭取最後勝利之時。大東亞戰爭爆發以來時憶年餘，我多數忠勇將士咸抱捨生報國之志而殉君國。此次統率日本無敵海軍振神武於宇內之由本元帥，於前綫督戰時壯烈火殉國，阿圖島之日守軍以寡敵衆，全軍玉碎，其至誠盡忠，實足驚天地而泣鬼神。吾人外語追想此戰之猛烈，將士之忠勇時，不禁熱血沸騰，門志益堅，　　敵愾之心及殉國之志汕然而生，誓傾全力以增强一切戰力，突破萬難，決擊減英美以雪此仇，而完成護國將士未竟之志，同時完成君國大業以安聖慮」。</p>
<h3>日駐義大使　日高發表談話</h3>
<p>羅馬九晶中央社電　日駐義日高大使會於八日接見義國記者團，力言日本已確立應付現在世界戰局之決戰體制。大意謂日本巳有應付發生任何意外事態之準備，目下正努力維持與東亞共榮圈內各國之協調，關係各該國民衆亦已享受眞正之自由。又日本刻正繼續對渝方作戰，最近渝方將領之相率參加和運。即可證明日本進攻渝方之意圖之着着成功。至邱吉爾與羅斯福在此次華盛頓會談中，曾討論反軸心軍之攻擊主力，究應側重歐洲或側重東亞方面，但此種計劉易言難行，實不足介意云。</p>
<h3>美空軍力量薄弱　日掌握制空權</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電據日駐華派遣軍某基地電：日陸軍航空部隊在華中前綫爲擊滅駐渝美軍，自一月以來即展開勇敢之作戰，屢次實行强襲，粉碎敵人之反攻企圖。故在現階段上，美空軍究竟能否如其狂言而空襲日本。茲爲檢討起見，綜合理地日空軍人昌之意見如次：據轟炸部隊指揮官某部隊長談，若欲在日本本土轟炸，就技術而論，則自昆明等地或可空襲日本本土，且因日方掌握前進基地之制空權，故渝美空軍終無生還之望。如敵統一式（一三二四）型機之行動半徑僅有三百公里內外，其最高性能如此低劣，行動範圍自亦狹小。又如敵北美式（一三二五）型機之性能尤更惡劣，且問題當在隊志之如何，蓋敵軍僅知如何逃逸而極缺積極態度，故決無克服一切困難空製日本本土而決心轟炸之勇敢精神。又戰鬥機指揮官某部隊長談，敵戰鬥機（P四〇）型（P四三）型之性能，並不足懼，其行動半徑縱携帶補助添油槽·亦僅有一千公里內外，如此而欲組成戰鬥機轟炸機編隊決無可能者，僅以轟炸機實行室襲，則必爲日守衛本土之戰鬥機擊落。又美軍士氣雖較去年爲佳，然僅於其機數較日方占絕大優勢時，始敢對日方之挑戰採取集團戰法實行攻擊，如共機數與日方相同或不及日方時，殆無勇氣應戰。（又偵察機部隊某部隊隊長談，（因日機之連日猛攻，敵方現正力圖反攻，然亦僅在梁山恩施衡陽等中間基地偶一出現，後即遁入內地。自目前情形而觀，敵機似不能對日方實現挑戰，而（B一七）型等長距離轟炸機尚未出現，如果實施攻擊則日方亦必將痛加反擊。現日軍士氣均極旺盛，且均具有堅强之信念。</p>
<h3>爪哇靑年警官　派赴台灣留學</h3>
<p>瓜加爾達九日中央社電　　爪哇軍政監部以提高原住民警察官之資質，實爲當前急務。頃爲靑成青少年有爲之幹部警察官起見，此次特選拔中堅幹部優秀警官十令，派赴台灣日本警察學校切學，留學期閒定爲兩月，目下正於斯卡布摩之警察學校受頂備訓練。</p>
<h3>日報分析　各中立國動向</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電日名古屋（中部日本新聞）九日以「中立國之動向一爲題，撰論分析今日各中立國之動向，至爲確切。茲譯錄其大意如次：「當此世界大戰之秋，世界各地仍保持其中立國乃至非交戰國之立塲者尚有七國，即南美之阿根廷·西亞之阿富汁及土耳其·伊伯利安半島之西班牙及葡萄牙·中歐之瑞士·與北歐之瑞典等是。以上各國之共同希望，在不欲直接　入戰爭旋渦，　　觀期挽救此次世界於戰火之中　　。但若檢討此次大戰之性格，則可知此次大戰，無非僅爲表面上之軸心與反軸心兩陣容之利害衝突，其根源實爲新舊兩世界之爭。蓋自上次大戰以來二十餘年間，由英美法等所謂戰勝國以人爲的方法，造成不自然之世界舊秩序，至此在其木身中巳發生自潰作用。向時乃有適應此種情勢，以努力進行建設世界新秩序之一種工作，此即運照自然條件，將世界之土地人口物姿等里作合理之分配與組織。此項工作，於武力戰及外交戰上雖稍有得失，然亦必銳意以爭，此即爲此次大戰中廣佈於世界各地之主流。果如此則今日各中立國恐終未能始終超然置身於此主流之外，或於彼等尚未自行參加此項世界革命之前，世界情勢已不再容許其再持閉關自守之態度，物屬常然。目前英美若增强西亞方面之駐軍，則阿富汗及土耳其即傾向於英美。又歐洲戰局之在現階段上，阿根廷之期美表示好感，與瑞典之接近德國相同，此當爲必然之現　。至於西班牙及葡萄牙之立塲，實異常微妙，此亦無容否認者。要之，今日中立國之動向，巳無法根據其自身之意已爲　歸，則悉決之於世界戰爭起勢之所向。各中立國責任當局所發表之言論，往往其言外之意，即說明其本身乏意志與其客　情勢相衝突，而　　深刻之苦悶。因此吾人若詳細檢討彼等之言論，則自可易於明確認識事態。是故今日中立國之動向，實爲今日世界情勢之一極反映也。</p>
<h3>英美對阿根廷　利害關係對立</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城八日中央社電阿根廷新政府之外交政策，當局僅發表極簡單之聲明，略謂目下仍維持中立。鑒共維持中立聲明之背後，更可窺知英美兩國對該國有複雜之利害關係。蓋美國鍳於目下世界戰爭之情勢，而竟盡一切手段使阿根廷放棄中立，置於共勢力範圍下，並使其分担戰爭上之負担。然英國希望該國仍維待中立，其原因亦無非該國現存之英帝國主義利權，實較美國以及其他各國在該國之勢力佔優勢。以繼濟上而觀，阿根廷之鐵路電信電力煤氣冰凍裂肉工廠等金業中，英國名金實佔極大優勢。阿根廷在經濟上依存英國及歐洲各國之程度，實出乎－般想像之上。是以阿根廷一旦棄中立，前失卻在大西洋方面之自由航行權，則英國所造打擊亦匪淺。英美兩國間因有以上所述種極原因，致兩國之利害關係處於完全對立之地位。</p>
<h3>科學勝利之聲（四）　化石下的資源　動員地質學家開闢南方</h3>
<p>戰爭業山完全述上消耗戰的階段了。爲了爭取勝利，任何物賣都必須善於利用。全東亞領域的地下蘊藏着無窮盡的物資，正在高興地期待着開發，鐵，煤炭，煤油，鐵樊土，鍚等鑛產，都是戰爭上不可或缺的物資。於是開發無盡藏的地下資源，立刻驅上戰爭過程，爲勝利的大東亞戰爭蓄鬥。但這類東亞的地下資源，也決不是藉偶然的支配而獲得的結果。爲了發見這類鑛物，曾不知費了幾黔年月的科學探求。在我們眼前映現出的束亞秘密潛在戰力，是怎樣獲得的？這需要地質學給或們－個答覆。</p>
<p>「以近似沒有任何異狀的路傷石塊之化石作對象，廢廳忘食絞盡腦汁地來研先牠的地質果家和地史學家，世界上大多數人對於他們作何感想呢？一定會有人在想，與戰爭亳無關係的化石研究，簡直在國家存亡關頭上的大戰上亳然裨益。但這稱想法是錯誤的，在南方？在滿洲，在中國，曾把地下物資源源不絕地抵出地面，這對於戰爭是盡了如何偉大的效能呢！地質學也正像當黑差國飛機裝配員一樣」</p>
<p>說這一段話的。是發表「東亞地質之研究與地下資源之研究「夜著的東京帝大理學部長兼學士院食員加藤武夫理學傳士。</p>
<p>「擁有地面非常廣大的大東亞共榮圈，是與歡洲銜地相接的東亞大陸及其附近的日本羣島，東印度軍島你形成的。這在物質學上來說，其產生與變遷史各自不同，且在氣象學上來署，則包含着寒帶，溫帶，熱帶。這一點也就必然地產生東亞豐富的地上與地下資源之差異。然而以前的閃發．實在是不能令人滿意。其最大的致侖原因，便是基木地質學的知識太脅乏，而其探求力則非常不充分。那未爲了探求地下資源。爲什麼必須研究化石之類的東西呢？這一點，我們舉兩三個實例來說明。</p>
<p>金屬鑛床</p>
<p>大陸與羣島的地質，有其各自不同點。金　鑛慶也受其地贊之影響，其組成份子也必然有所不同。一般說來，在大陸地帶的深厚處，金鋼　與鐵鑛床非常多．這是島嶼地方所沒有的。那末爲什么麼羣島上　種鑛脈呢？這完全是火山在其中作崇，因此在群島的淺薄處，金銀銅等鑛脈多，而鐵鑛脈少。</p>
<p>鐵礬上</p>
<p>南方地帶古代時的風化作用非常厲害，因此岩與石解體而成爲紅土之土壞。這種紅土形成的時侯，原來岩石中包含的鐵輿釩遂漸溶解而沉澱於泥土中，於是便成爲鐵鑛和鐵　土。</p>
<p>錫</p>
<p>某一地女時投，花崗岩在南方崩昭時，共團園附着的錫，後來便成爲錫鑛而。而且在　帶地方，此種鵡鑛床因自然作用而分解，化成屑沫朱流入砂中，便在砂鑛中沉澱。</p>
<p>煤油</p>
<p>地賣學上之策三紀時投（我學衡上是比較新的時代），現在煤油礦宋多的地方，全曾是淺海。在這種海底上沉砂沉澱而成爲厘的層，在這釋地積上夾雜着生物的遺骸，北上而又有一層砂和沉·生物的遣骸被天然所乾溜而成爲媒油，後來這種海地帶成爲陸地，便成爲煤油池，形成一個地層，在這個地層高突出來的皺紋膚，專門名飼稱爲皆斜部分，最上面就有煤氣，其下面就有煤油，再共下面就是水了。所以從這種背斜構造部分鑿孔的話，一定會噴出煤油來。這是從地賀學的研究中得出來的編論。　　化石是世界的　生物理沉於地層中的遺物。所以若仔細地一檢討，就由於發現這種化石，可以判斷在地下第幾紀層的什麼地方理藏着這種資源。在滿洲和中國的某幾處准地上突出來，包含某種特殊化　石的奧陶系三灰岩。如在這種突起處的近挖掘，則一定會發見煤炭。地下資源是這樣地金租化石有關係。所以研究化石愈進步，則古成物學，地質構造學，地史學，基礎地質學，屬位學等也愈進步．既明自了如上述資源之存在理由，那末我們就努力從事開發地下資源。現在開發地下資源，必須根據地質學之理論。所以將來隨着愈益進步的地質學，而不斷地開發未開的地下資源，以備明日戰力的靈活運用。（濤譯自每日新聞）</p>

<h3>地中海各島嶼　軸心軍防衛嚴密　拉姆培杜薩島英軍登陸未逞　美空軍集中企圖轟炸巴爾幹</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德通訊社軍事記者頃就反軸心軍企圖在地中海拉姆培杜薩島（　Lmpedusa）登陸事報道稱：反軸心軍企圖在拉姆培杜薩登陸，乃欲進犯義本土之初舉，但已遭義防衛軍予以重挫，終未得逞。此次企圖登陸之英軍，均曾受特別訓練，且全員均持有自動步槍，兵力約爲一大隊。該島面積僅二十平方公里，位於距西西里島南端二百公里之處，該島之要塞雖遠不及馬爾太與班泰勒里亞島等處堅固，但義軍僅於數小時內，即將企圖登陸之敵軍悉數殲滅。反軸心軍此次在該島登陸，乃以試探義軍之防禦力爲目的。</p>
<p>羅馬九日中央社電　英國各報於英首相邱吉爾返抵倫教以後，即頻傳反軸心軍即將在歐洲大陸展開新作戰。而自日前英軍在西西里島南方之拉姆培社薩島企圖登陸作戰，地中海之戰機頓吿緊迫。此次英軍之登陸作戰，雖因義軍之勇敢反擊而告失敗，但反軸心空軍連日正轟炸義本土前哨防衛綫之班泰勒里亞島·西西里島·及撒丁島等，故預料反軸心軍勢將企圖再對此等島嶼實行登陸作戰，故反軸心軍之反攻地中海各島計劃，殆無可疑。傳美國空軍部隊現亦正集合於塞普魯斯島，企圖轟炸巴爾榦半島，允注重於轟炸希臘西部，此舉或爲反攻杜得里斯羣島及克里特島之前提。察皮軸心軍之用意欲將上述各島奪回後，即可獲得在歐洲登陸作戰之基地，同時開啓地中海之水路，藉以加强對東部戰綫蘇軍之援助，並確保通往印度之運輸路綫。故義軍司令部當局爲防備反軸心軍之登陸作戰起見，正將海岸各要地完全要塞化，又增強守備軍遍設機雷而布成嚴密之防衛陣綫。</p>
<p>羅馬九日中央社電　義軍司令部九日發表戰報稱：反軸心軍於八日以海空兩軍猛擊班泰勒里亞島後，復勸吿該島義守軍投降，當予嚴厲拒絕。</p>
<p>羅馬九日中央社電　昨日此間負責方面宣稱：班泰勒里亞島之高射砲隊及海岸砲位之砲手，均由法西斯民團擔任，指揮一職亦屬民團之軍官，海岸砲位各砲手之準確射擊，會迫使進攻之英戰鬥艦停止開火，而高射砲手之技術亦同樣驚人。據昨日義方戰報宣布。該島擊落之敵機不下一百架之多，民團方面亦稍有傷亡。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾演說稱　大戰已迫在眉睫　承認潛艇威脅依然嚴重</h3>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據倫敦消息：英首相邱吉爾昨日在下議院演說，承認英國之主要憂慮，乃軸心國潛艇戰爭之有效，及反軸心船隻損失重大。邱氏並暗示遲早終將有主要之大戰。同時邱氏又力言在突尼西亞之戰役中，英第一軍及第八軍曾蒙嚴重之損失。邱氏對於最近將來之發展，並未群細討論，僅謂「非常複雜與危險之大規模海陸戰爭已迫在眉睫。邱氏又稱；蘇軍方作殊死戰，東綫不久即將有大規模之戰鬥。但吾人未能與斯達林或蘇聯之其他代表接觸，深以爲憾。蘇聯負有最重大之責任與犧牲最多之血肉，每一協約國對戰事自有不同之觀點，惟吾英人則繼續以防禦潛艇之戰事認爲首要，蓋必須征服潛艇，吾人始得生存而定行動。五月份之情形，爲自美國參戰以還最良好之一月。邱氏繼又提及渠在華盛頓舉行之會議，謂渠與羅斯福總統間之關係，已成爲私人之友誼，及在思想上行動上之同志夥友·邱氏又詳細討論北非之狀况，謂反軸心在突尼西亞之損失嚴重。在越過的黎波里丹尼亞戰綫之後，蒙高茂萊將軍所屬英第八軍損失一一·五〇〇人，安特森將軍之英第一軍損失二三。五〇〇人。首相又言渠之訪問北非，並無政治性質。渠言，「當余在阿爾及爾時，適値特戈爾偕同其友人抵達，故余特電召艾登外相到塲協助，在組織所謂法國國民解放委員會之談判中，吾人無加以干預之必要。但吾人與艾森霍華將軍同樣作密切注意，以顧及英美之利益及吾人駐北非軍隊之福利。首相在演說時，並未提及戰區之先後及將來之作戰問題。</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據阿爾及爾電：北非法蘭西解放委員會於九日發表，決定任季勞爲陸海空三軍總司令，指揮全部軍事，並由特戈爾統轄一般政務。</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據阿爾及爾消息：法國國民解放委員會又已增加委員七人。據美方無綫電廣播，謂其中三人係特戈爾派，三人係季勞派，另有一人係中立派。</p>
<h3>英國將增加　駐蘇外交人員</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩九日中央社電　海通社訊：英國駐莫斯科之外交代表，不久即將增加，英國將首决派遣大使及公使各一人駐於蘇聯，公使一職將調曾任駐葡萄牙公使之飽爾福担任。</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫境內　游擊隊被包圍</h3>
<p>阿格蘭九日中央社電　海通社訊，據此問報載：波斯尼亞與斯哥維那之游擊隊，現已被軸心軍完全包圍於蒙特尼格羅，目前戰事仍在進行中。游擊隊突圍計劃已告失敗，死傷甚爲慘重。</p>
<h3>在歐戰現階段中　土保持武裝中立　伊斯美總統之明確表示</h3>
<p>安加拉九日中央社電　土耳其總統伊斯美，昨日在共和人民黨第六屆大會開幕時，表示土耳其政府在世界大戰之現階段中，決心保持其中立。總統官稱：「吾人堅決保證吾人國家之安全，必要時爲自衛計，亦有舉全力以作戰之準備。此次戰爭至何時及於何種狀態下結束，固不能預言，但吾人以爲不久之將來，和平即將到來。總統繼稱，土耳其財政現時有空前之需求，政府採取各項適宜之措施以應付之。總統又表示希望民衆較以往更應直接注意內政，尤須嚴格選擇秉政之人選，惟有如此，方能維持民衆與政府間之信任，而使政府得有所決定。共和人民黨對於此方面之貢獻，殊足稱道，國會應取以爲法。總統指示該黨之未來工作後，謂國民之眞正幸福，僅能於爲國服務中求之云。</p>
<h3>日駐蘇公使　返抵庫壁希夫</h3>

<p>里斯本九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，曼麗蘭州艾爾克頓地方特萊姆甫火藥廠，忽起爆炸，至少死女工一二五人，傷者無數，屍體大半已無法辯認，艾爾克頓全鎭門窗皆被震碎，該廠共有工人萬餘名，肇禍原因不詳，該廠前任經理兩人均因犯欺詐罪，現在法院審理中。</p>
<h3>竇尼資元帥暢談　最後勝利確保無疑</h3>
<p>（柏林守山特派員三十一日發）德國海軍長官竇尼資元帥，等於日本的海軍大臣兼軍令部總長，同時並又兼任着如横須賀鎭守府長官的地位，直接指揮縱横全世界洋面的德國大潛水艦隊，是德國海軍中的第一人。記者提出日德海軍的共同作戰潛水艦戰的發展，以及其他諸問題的質問，向竇尼資元帥要求會見，雖在軍務倥惚中承於五月三十一日抽暇接見記者。自元帥就任海軍總司令以來，與國內外新聞記者會見，此尙爲初次。記者偕同日本海軍武官室的藤村少佐，於該日午前十時訪問德國海軍部的部長室。竇尼資元帥軀幹魁梧，今年五十二歲，比前任長官賴特年輕十六歲，和記者握手時，一見之下，即如爲沉默寡言的人，溫藹之情，溢於言表。以下爲竇尼資元帥與記者的問答。</p>
<p>爭取主動權</p>
<p>竇尼資元帥說：『我們全體德國海軍將士，　深地被山本聯合艦隊司令長官的爲國捐軀之情所感動。那在日本　海戰紀念日所發表的日本海軍在此次戰爭中所獲的戰績，是山本元帥之偉勳流傳千古的紀念碑。我致日本海軍的電文中，把我們對日本海軍的欽佩和信賴傳達到貴國，實出於衷心的感動而發的。承責國島田海相及永野軍令部長懇切致答，非常榮幸。』</p>
<p>竇元帥繼即轉變詞　，聲述對目前海戰所懷的抱負。他　說當英法對德宣戰時，剛在着手建設的德海軍，怎樣的克服種種不利環境的經過。</p>
<p>竇元帥接着說：「君在開戰前就以新聞記老資格駐在德國，所以大概很明白，當時尙在搖籃時代再建的小海軍，被迫與英國作戰。即在北海及大西洋，英法的艦隊已有比我們十倍以上的勢力。但我們對這大敵並不恐怖，開戰的第一日起，我海軍即取閃電行動從敵方奪取攻擊的主動性，奇襲英國的心臟斯卡巴·佛洛軍港，在英國沿海岸佈設機雷。派遺潛水艦戰艦及巡洋艦至遼遠的大洋，占領敵方的上陸某地挪威海岸。造成了從北方威脅英國本土的姿勢。對英國本土的南翼，因我陸空軍之神奇的突襲，獲得了戰略上極爲重要的大西洋岸基地，即以此大西洋岸爲根據地，我潛水艦乃能不斷的活動。而威脅敵的生命動脈。我潛水艦所成就的戰果，自卅庸在此再如贅述。這潛水戰正在加速威脅英國本土的時候美團以爲日本可欺而加以脅迫，終於參戰，這是敵方陣營之根本的錯覺。我們德國人對那時候日本之毅然　其强大的力量與決斷而攻擊美國的傲慢，隨時懷着讚欽與驚異來同憶着。</p>
<p>記者於此聲述在目前的重大戰局中，以三國同盟爲中心的諸國之密切的合作，表示慶幸，對德國潛水艦隊的偉大，尤不勝慶幸。竇尼資元帥於是帶着會心的微笑，述說了如次的意義深長的言論！</p>
<p>『誠如君言，把日本海軍在太平洋中的大戰果和德國潛水艦在大西洋的戰果合併看來，我們知道此次世界戰爭中在海洋舞臺上決定戰的本質在那裏？我們日德義同盟海軍的全部戰鬥力，決不是個別的各自爲戰，利用其獨特的配置，忽東忽西，飄忽無定，到處牽制，攻擊英美的軍艦及商船，漸漸地削弱敵的力量。我方陣營的這種交互戰鬥的作用，終於毫不假借的减低了敵方的力量。</p>
<p>擊沉數超過造船力</p>
<p>「我方同盟國　營到現在爲止，擊沉敵船的總數，記得是三千一百五十萬噸，對此潛水艦戰，願聞閣下的高見。」經記者的提詢，竇元帥即作如下的答問：</p>
<p>「這數字正足以證明無論敵方取怎樣的防禦戰術，無論敵方怎樣的拚命建造新船，亦不能超過我方的攻擊力。我們尤其感謝與信賴的，即日本在這擊沉敵船的戰果中，在本質上實居重要地位，即在將來亦將如此。不過論及在廣大的海上舞台中殲减敵船工作的效果時，我們應就全體的擊沉戰果爲對象而論。常被各種條件所支配的海上戰鬥的戰果。時多時少，是難於避免的現象，決定海上戰鬥的勝敗者，在於最後的總戰果以何種形式顯現。譬如說，像我們的潛水艦。日積月累的從敵的輸血管中抽取血液。</p>
<p>記者告以最近敵方頗在跨稱其潛水艦防禦戰術的進步，德海軍對此的對策如何？</p>
<p>竇元帥答稱：『敵人在想逃，我們則在想追。敵人因要設法逃，所以當然想出種種戰術，至於這的方面，其攻擊戰術自然也不會故步自封而停頓不前的。我們的新戰術，新武器，也日新月異地硏究者。改良者，並且在實地活用者。</p>
<p>記者聆此，想起了竇尼資提督任潛水艇長在一九一八年從地中海繞出大西洋時的逸話。當時的長官曾批評竇尼資說：「沒有見過　竇尼資那樣心雄胆潑的人。他有時吞食水雷，有時衝突，有時投入海中，如其都照竇尼資這樣冒險做法，德國的潛水艦，不久即將全部消滅了罷，」</p>
<p>記者續問：「今日恰爲德海軍視爲光榮的斯卡開拉克海戰的紀念日，在今後的世界戰中，願聞閣下所懷的信念」。</p>
<p>竇元帥答稱：「我確信我們同盟陣營的諸國，在將來的海戰中，持有絕對不敗的精神與力量。海上戰鬥的形式，比斯卡開拉克海戰時有很大的變化，而在今後亦將有更大的變化。不過近代洪戰無論在地域上，戰略上，技術上，如何典以前不同，我們的目的毫不動搖，在任何時候，集中於一個同樣的目標。即在爭取最後的勝利。這是我們至上目的。」</p>
<p>記者至此，即以對阿岡島日本將士的玉碎精神，詢問竇元帥作何感想了元帥爽直的說：</p>
<p>「在這正義的戰爭中，將士們的壯烈殉戰決不是無意義的，阿圖島的使人感動即在於此。日水古時的士人氣節，迄今猶在日本人的血液中流傳着，勇敢的日本兵士們，在此地重又拿來顯示於全世界人士之前。略知日本歷史的人們，不雖揣想全部日本國民對遠離故國的阿留申之悲壯的戰鬥，怎樣地引起反動，有何影響。古賀新長官之下的日本聯合艦隊，全體日本軍，今後的士氣將愈更旺盛，繼續對敵作戰，我相信小的災害會變成大的幸福」</p>
<p>竇尼資元帥方於今晨歸還柏林，席不暇暖，即將出發重臨前綫。飛機業已待命紀飛。記者感謝元帥在百忙中抽暇接見。此日在德國海軍部所獲的印象，覺得自軍務局長以次的首腦部都是非常年輕的人。一見竇尼資元帥就任最高司令官以後，老人們全部告退了。沒有比五十二歲的竇尾資長官年高的人。（翔：譯自六月三日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>節制棉製品消費　採憑票配給制　每人全年消費將爲七十六分　日僑下月開始華方尙在醞釀</h3>
<p>關於棉製品節制消費，採取配給制度，先自日僑方面開始，定自下月起實行一事，業經日大使館，日總領署及居留民團三方，與物資統制當局迭决協議，具體辦法，雖尙未經最後決定，惟據國風社訪員探悉，就目下狀况言，法爲憑票配給制度。</p>
<p>產婦小兒特別配給</p>
<p>此種制度，大致爲將每人全年消費總分數規定爲七十六分，例如毛巾每條定爲一分，漂白布一疋爲六分，白洋布十碼爲二十分，毛巾在一年內，最低限度，得配給三條。全年消費品總分數，不論其成分如何，不得超過規定。又對於小兒及產婦，並考慮採用特別配給制度。至於配給票之發行塲所及經營配給棉製品之指定另售商店等，目下正由各有關方面進行愼重審議。查配給之棉製品計十一種：（一）毛巾，（二）白洋布，（三）漂白布，（四）絨布，（五）棉紗綫及洋紗綫，（六）紗布，（七）藥棉，（八）布襪，（九）洋襪，（十）襯褲，（十一）襯杉。至於華人方面之棉製品配給，似猶在醞釀階段中。</p>

<p>保加利亞駐日公使兼駐華公使斐義浦氏，自抵京呈遞國書後，連日酬酢甚爲忙碌，保公使本定於八日來滬，轉道赴日，現因他事，改於昨（九日）晨九時，乘車來滬，同行者除隨員外，外部並派王秘書伴送至滬，聞保公使在滬領事勾留，即轉道赴日。</p>
<h3>法捕房毆辱推事　表示賠償道歉</h3>
<p>關於法捕房中央區區長蒲歇戈，於本月七日晨在辣斐德路口發生毆辱第二特區地方法院推事王藍勝事件，藐視法官，阻碍公務，業已再度引起全市市民之憤　，經特二法院向法捕房嚴重交涉後，法捕房允予賠償及道歉，曾派員至該院訪問首席檢察官沈文傑，表示歉意外，復至王推事寓次誌歉，惟王推事以此事有關尊重中國司法，未便擅專，是以未予延見，拒絕道歉，該院院長陳秉鈞，現已因公入京，定今日返滬，是以該事件須俟陳院長返滬後，始能獲得適當之解決途徑。</p>
<p>上海各團體張案後援會，昨函第二特區地方法院陳院長，謂六月七日張案開審之後，敎唆主犯郭士元，竟與其代理律師，互擲紙團，應請於下次開庭時，對該律師不法情形，加以懲戒。又中國孔聖學會昨電行政院外交部，爲法院推事王蘭勝前往法院辦公，途中被辱，請即交涉。</p>
<h3>戳斃同學案　定期宣判</h3>
<p>育材公學十六歲學生姜廉江，以利刃殺死十六歲同學金維剛一案，昨晨由特一法院堵福曜推事開刑二庭續訊，被吿姜廉江並未委任律師辯護，依法由庭上指定葛肇基律師爲義務辯護人，而死者之父金友明則延陶悟志律師附帶民訴，請求賠償喪葬事業等費共四十六萬九千七百九十九元。且因被吿尙未成年，共父親姜節安應連帶負賠償之責。先由捕房代表律師張天蔭陳述案情，繼死者之父供述經過，詰之被吿姜廉江供稱：當時至死者處，實未携刀，因死者出刀刺我，我奪住反刺，實無預謀殺人之意。庭上以事實明瞭，諭令開始辯論。即　捕房代表律師張天蔭起而論吿，略謂本件死者之山於被吿所殺死，已爲不爭之事實。雖刑法六十三條規定未滿十八歲或超過八十歲者不得處死刑或無期徒刑，捕房受法律上之束縛，自不能請求處被吿以極刑或無期徒刑，而有期徒刑之最高年額爲十五年，若情節重大者，得予酌加。故請求依法加重處斷，處以徒刑二十年云云，繼由指定辯護律師葛肇基辯稱：兇刀旣無旁證，足以證明由被吿持往，而被吿堅稱係死者圖加審於其而反抗之，則屬於自衛之方法，僅屬過防衛當，故請求從輕處斷。庭上乃諭辯諭終結，定下星期三宜吿判決。</p>

<p>經濟界　小言論</p>
<h3>再論華北災荒的敎訓</h3>
<p>本欄於五月二十五日論「華北災荒的敎訓」，即提出此次華北災荒的原因，由於雨量稀少，富人囤糧，外糧不來，棉田推廣，以及「無益作物」的廣植。在上述各種原因中，最後一點却爲最要一點。何以言之？雨量稀少是一時的，而且是人爲的；富人囤糧是法律所可解決的；外糧不來是政治所可補救的；福田推廣猶足解決衣的問題，而且華北之棉，猶可以易華中之米；惟有「無益作物」的廣植，乃眞爲現在與未來饑荒的人工製造者。</p>
<p>由於前日上海各界華北急振會第一次各組聯絡會談席上的幾件報告，我們愈覺從今以後，如欲爲華北民眾解除饑荒的痛苦，則改種「有益作物」，實爲當前的惟一要圖。那末，如何去改種「有益作物」呢？正是那幾件報吿中所猜出的：（苞米種籽，設法運送災區培植，（二）北方缺乏種子，設法儘速供給，（三）勸種中國山薯，以裕糧食；苞米與山薯，非但是大衆化的食糧，並且是富有營養料的食糧，正是所謂「有益作物」的最佳代表。整個華北「無益作物」的種植，都應當以這一類的「有益作物」去代替。這樣一來，要比「積穀防災」的辦法，來得澈底多多了。</p>
<p>還有一句補充的話：「有益作物」所包括的食糧種類甚多，當然不僅限於苞米與山薯；但旣爲「有益作物」，便當儘量用以供給民食，不當任意付諸消耗用途。所以，張一鵬先生請收小麥，停止製酒，以充振糧；酒原來不是民食所需的，而收買小麥的主要作用，乃爲配給粉廠製粉，供給民食需要。因此，我們不但要提倡「有益作物的廣植，並且要反對「有益作物」的虛耗。這些問題，尤其是「無益作物」的廣植，都是我們所得自華北災荒的敎訓。</p>
<h3>商統會唐理事長　闡明各業組織意義　希望各當選理監事廉明辦事</h3>

<h3>誠實的鏡子</h3>
<p>— 程巨蓀</p>
<p>諱說「人不自知其貌」？祗要對一面說子照－照，不是一目繚然了麼！</p>
<p>但是切莫要在鏡子裏看　自已底醜臉而悲傷。也莫要以自己底美貌而自豪！因爲鏡子是不誠實的，它祇能表現出你底外形和容銳——衣冠楚楚的人體，而不能顯示出「挪實」的你來——你底人格。</p>
<p>鏡子既然祇僅給我們看見外貌的醜與美，那麼我們要用怎機的鏡子才能照見我們底人格呢？當然我們需要一面「誠實的鏡子」，這就是「良心反省」，唯右「良心」才能知道自己底人格，唯有「反省」才能知道自己一切的錯誤。曾子曰：「吾日川省吾身」占之聖賢尚且如此，何况吾曾入世求深的青年。</p>
<p>人們往往在做一件事的時候。當時紀不會察覺自己所益的事是「對」或「不對」，若事後再不加「反省」那麼他底錯誤是永遠不會改過來的了，還有一種人明知這事不應如此做，那麼卻一味固執地幹下去，這也是青年人氣盛所造成的錯誤的利念，…有覺因這些錯誤就喪失了自己底人格。</p>
<p>朋友們，用你底「誠實的鏡子」向己照一照吧！並且仔細地瞧一瞧，嚴察出你以往的錯誤，斜正你固執的觀點，這樣你就會成爲一位良好的，眞正的「人」了！</p>
<p>最後，我還要不憚煩地告訴你：「切奠要化費許多時問在梳妝台上的說子　面，應當盡量利用空閒的時音照你「誠實的鏡子」——良心反省」，</p>
<h3>學生呼聲　高中畢業生的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 季維一</p>
<p>觀愛的朋友：你不是好久沒接到我的音訊了罷！我告訢你·並不是我止忙於準備著考試而把你的詢問忽略了，而是畢業的苦悶使我如穩入五里等中。現在我想把它門吐露給你看，也好讓我胡以亂想的腦子、仔細洗滌一番。</p>
<p>高中畢業了．這該是被人羨慕的。可是，誰能了解他們心頭的煩悶？這煩悶的原因無非是環境所巡成的，無怪前人曾浩嘆：「畢業即從來」了。</p>
<p>畢業後唯有的是二條路：升學和就業。</p>
<p>家境此較可以過得去而想讀書的人是不成問題的。可是，我們偏偏是不事此產，不善理時而又是要繼續讀害的一份子，學費賤而又能求得眞才實學的學枚，投考者的多是在意料之中，而能否錄取眞是一個令人肌寒的問題。否則，如果不能考取，那麼，學校雖然多得價雲海，那一筆很可觀的學費，刻得煞費心思去獲得。而臘出這麼冬的錢，是香能買到（事實如此）等最的貨色呢？這是一個「莫大」的疑問。</p>
<p>因此，便有很多同學決然不再讀書，率性就業，爽爽快快用快刀斬亂麻的手段把求學的雖路一股腦兒擲賭腦後。可是，他們也有苦悶。也有難　．這從那兒說起呢？</p>
<p>原來這是－個人浄於率的社會，區一中學舉業生論學識不及一般老前輩及大學生，（雖然有些大學生也是處有其表。）論經騐更遠不如從學徒訓練想來的職員。並且，「初生之犢不怕虎，中學出做起事來沒有一般老職員好差使；而他們的派頭（？）卻一點也沒宥。因爲消社會好像祇需要眼睛明天望的人　，與事事低頭伕小的被歷消者。因此，高中畢業生便普遍地不受人歡迎。何况更在這米玷薪桂，處處請求緊縮的年頭兒。</p>
<p>所以，就業也不是很客易的一件事。這些我們祇能歸咎於這可詛咒的社會。</p>
<p>我們可以很明自地看出這社會的矛盾：要讀書的人沒有力量負担起高昻的學費，而有錢的卻不要讀書。爲生活而努力去工作的人，找不到僅能維持生活的職業，而不愁吃不愁穿戴的卻居高位，拚會歛財。</p>
<p>你要說我發半騷嗎？不管怎樣，這究覽是事實啊！</p>
<p>你想，處在這時代，中學畢業生焉得不苦悶？</p>
<h3>爲我與爲他</h3>
<p>— 章</p>
<p>楊來爲我：拔一毛以利天下不爲也。等子爲他：康頂放　而利天下，一權做人，而有如此不同的道理，滇呌人難於適從。但是仔細一想，爲了「爲我」，便不能不去「爲地」，「爲他」也就是所以「爲我」。「爲找」夾「爲他」，這二者雖說，　才　衡突，同時也威於合作的地位。爲着貫澈我們生活的任務，一個也不能個廢的。</p>
<p>所謂「爲我」，不一定是甚麼自私自利的生活主張——惟有那祇如道獨善其身的楊朱先生所主張的才是自私自利——用現代請來說明這「爲我」兩個字的意議，就是所　個人生存的權利。不過要逮到個人生存的目的，則又非本者「爲他」的精神去共同建立起一個良好的社會不行的。因爲人　竟是社會的動物，脫離了就會就聲爲荏署無能·不堪生存了。因爲如此，所以他一面是一個私人。一面又是社會的分子，且有了謊雙重的關係，便少不得一面去「爲我」，一而又「爲他」了．</p>
<p>杨孑为才、健只上到做人的一方面。不齡汗馭是一緬儷廷·吝耑的棧床那取知遞社會才娥憫人康活的搖籃，它木跑原不其有義麼目的，憎紙不過千萬佣惆人跦土活鸞憂的機構。要是像他那麼訑去漢視他生存所寄的社會和拒絕與社會合作，那末，不但連地所不肯捨裏的一根毛也保小住，就是他襬個生命也無從寄既。所以必然　學學子那樣地去下審苦工，然很一個可能予取予求的理想之社會才有希望建立起來，而在這實踐「爲他」的過程中·也絲於完成了那「露我」的住務。</p>
<p>不過像楊朱那般不高明的「爲我」。還不過是一種消　的處做態度而已，比起那般不祗是不拔一毛，而且還要刮人家皮的傢伙來，則還見得不聽明，不狡繪而久不厲害呢！可是話又說回來，無論這般人佔了無數的便宜，發了無數不義的大財，而社會的機構卻一再喪失了公平的運用，結果安定和秩序，也就要無法維持下去·社會的不幸也就是個人此活幸福的障　、眞正知道迫求個人沈活幸福的人們。誰都如這玩意就等於弄火，爲智者所不取的吧！</p>
<h3>談通俗文學</h3>
<p>— 東方</p>
<p>文學的部門中，一般的通俗文學，所獲得的謂者層是駕於一切他種文學之上的。因爲文學本是大衆的東西，而通俗文學是大康性的。</p>
<p>通俗文學的閉始老是芙國作家狄更斯。這並不是在他的作品之前無通俗文學，而是的作品可以說是烏通俗文學開一新紀元，在他的作品裏，如「雙城記」「困雛的時勞「你，都是以下流社會的生活爲對象、對當時的轉換期的上流社會，有着非常大的反恐和辛辣的諷刺。他的作品缺少心理的描寫，而含有多量的幽默，他常常用行爲和動作來代替煩瑣的心理描寫。這些是爲一般的中下層羣衆所喜愛的。</p>
<p>通俗文學最大的價值，是爲了要提高大康讀者的水準。因此持有一種反撥的力量，而並不是把水準給低下去奉迎大衆，而彩威「一般的大衆的下流的，落伍的情緒之倡導者　辯者；「並不是不加選擇地迎合一般人的心理而將一般人的落伍的，屈從的，卑劣的情緒加以美化和修飾。</p>
<p>通俗文學的取材，不必限於中下社會階　的圈子叢。各種偉大的生活和上流社會的種種都是可以作爲題材的。它是用淺易的口調叙述出來，合於一般的大衆的口味的文學。當然，最佳的作品是一個作家的故活經騐的實錄。所以，希望作家把自身放入實此活中，去充寶作品的題材，採取這稱經騐的題材，而用淺易的口調，和適合大衆口味的筆法，構成精湛的作品，這作品，必能爲廣大的民衆所接受，而成爲火衆的文學。</p>
<p>現才我們所需要的，是一稱能提高大衆文化程度的通俗文學。准主題方面，應該是含方積極的對新社驇　成長扶助作用，而必須充分的克服祗具娛樂價值的，和過於空泛的非現實的作品。</p>
<h3>「達觀」·「逃避現實」</h3>
<p>— 文中</p>
<p>在商度的止估的壓方之下·作多人的心理都失郤了常態：一部份人終日徘徊在愁城裏怨天尤人，甚而至於不惜用自己的手來毀減自己的生命、另有些自命爲「達觀者」的人，抱着一大堆「得過且過」「做一天和尚撞一天鐘」「今日右酒今日醉」之類的「浪沒哲學」。祇可惜他們缺乏「看破紅塵」進而「削髪爲憎」的勇氣！</p>
<p>這般人認爲與環培掠鬥亦騰徒然：而自殺更大可不必，事實上他們根本就不願死、以爲人生在世，不過一次，爲樂當及時；何待來茲？於是乎袋裏有幾張鈔票的·整日周旋於聲色大爲之所，一味過着醉生夢死的生活，自以爲逍遙一世。啤睨天訑，至於那般典「孔方兄」無綠的人，也窮有窮開心，在繁囂的環境裏，滿想過一種清靜的生活，因此獨個兒關在斗室裏哼哼塗塗，發發窂騷，或者到馬路上逛逛，無聊時，約了幾世志同道合的「知友」到茶餘裏去坐上幾個鐘點，一邊呷茶；一邊評論路上走着的女子，或者各人暢論「人生觀」妙談「奇聞怪見」。</p>
<p>上面可代表的這種人物，都“以爲非常「達談J，誠憑宇宙是何等的偉大，自己是這樣的渺小，學生忙錄着什麼？何必自尋煩惱？不若拋棄了一切成功的美夢，進入自己的桃源境界去消磨一世！</p>
<p>其寶這種思想，何嘗有資格稱之爲「逹歡」？祗是一種「逃避現實「的棗想而已。這般人確寶爲環境聽克服，做了環境的犧牲者。</p>
<p>凡能不囤於環境，不爲善。怒·哀。樂所練移者，方能謂之「達觀」，　很明顯地「逹觀」是克服求境參而「逃遲境實恰是爲環境所克服，兩者絕對感於相對的地位。</p>
<p>我們處在這個動盐的社會裏，查任是何等重大？事實絕對不允許我們卸卻了肩頭的責任逃向桃花源去享樂，隱士般的生活於我們毫不謫宜，總之環境的確是惡劣的，但我們決不能用消極的態廣來逃避現實，我們信任前途是光明的祗要我們懷肴「逹觀」的思想：握住現寶，積極地與惡劣的環境相搏鬥！</p>
<h3>敎師與茶房</h3>
<p>— 生矅</p>
<p>我有一位親戚是中學敎師，他敎高中的國文，每小時酬報七元二角五分，一天敎足六小時，收入四十三元五角。八</p>
<p>我家裏老媽子的兒子是某公司的茶房，今天誰家闊老嫁女兒了，他公司裏公公私私大人小小併紀來送法幣一千二百元，收入力錢一百二十元，明天某銀行開幕，送一個銀的什麼，使力五十元。</p>
<p>敎書的精力有餘，一天能敎三四小時，已經大了不得，婚喪喜慶擇吉聞張接踵而來，每月總有十來次。</p>
<p>敎書的所負貴任是啟迪民智、培植國家楝攔；做茶房的是聽呼受喚，勞役爲生。</p>
<p>敎書的至少出筆成書，口若　河。能談談古今；做茶房的大多目不識了。</p>
<p>敎書的雖不率西裝，也得穿件長杉；人家叫他聲「先止」；茶房可以短衣小衫，別人看他是「短衫黨」。</p>
<p>但是敎師的酬報如此，茶房的酬報如此。</p>
<p>茶房獲得資水家的餘惠，已很好生活了；但是有幾個資本家想，到加徵惠於敎養自已子弟的老師？</p>
<p>安分守己的人都慶着生活困難，究竟爲什麼？</p>
<p>「不愚寡而患不均！」</p>
<h3>氣</h3>
<p>— 德芳</p>
<p>「氣」之爲叫大焉哉！－朝顯達權貨，對下人便可盛「氣」淡人，頭指氣使，好不威風？在下者呢？雖然撫故濃遭，也祇得低聲下氣，忍氣吞聲，不敢有所反　相辯。否則保不定飯碗打碎。所以大牛將氣　在胸中，或者囘到家中「淘氣」，將一腔怨氣發洩到老婆兒子身上，此之謂一蟹吃一蟹歟！</p>
<p>然而也有人根本受不住旁人的非難與奚落，所謂「爭氣不爭財」，寓願損失金錢，而不願在言語上讓人佔了上風，這就是所謂要面子的一派。</p>
<p>青年人常常被評爲「年少氣盛」口吻是逞着責備的，意思是不能忍。的確，青年人火都抱有一股勇氣，心中容納不下不愜意的東四！一怒而可以拋去一切、名氣遠行。固然，這一種激「氣」也眞能榦出一番大事，但要是就憑一時之「氣」，肓目出此，作孤注一擲，那末這一鼓所作之「氣」，將受不住一次二次的打擊與挫折，就要走「氣」了。</p>
<p>古人多講涵氣」之法，菩養吾浩然之氣，所謂宰相肚裏好撐船，就是說－個人要陶襟寬大，能容得下非難之論，容得下就是能忍，忍並不是麻木，她是有感應，有反省，有審察。有勞力，不讀情慼的「氣」　蔽了濟明的理知，氣急敗壞作莫須有的反聖，成功．不過發洩了他一己心頭之「氣」，失敗，將造成偏激，離開了大我走上歧路，把发脾氣作爲行事的指準了。</p>
<h3>三點覺悟</h3>
<p>— 任川</p>
<p>過么，自己常愚一種「優柔寡斷，遲疑不決」的毛病，買在是今甘「一事撫成」的致命傷。非驢非馬，不三不四，終於被人看不起，謎爲不學無術」，這是應該痛自覺悟的第一點。</p>
<p>持躬接物，應該和藹可親；立　處世，要誠實克己，年輕識淺，而就氣浮心躁，「眼高於頂，口大如箕」，信口吹簧，倣然不可一世，必至孤立失敗。這是廠該及早覺悟的第二點。</p>
<p>志向是行事的目標。無志向等於「盲人　瞎馬」，亂踰亂跳一陣，還不是始終陷在迷妄中嗎？故立志實爲首要。不立志，腳跟不穩、頭腦昏沈，無是非之分，不能作奸邪之別，流水浮華一樣的不知歸突何處！這樣的人生，豈非危險！這是應該切竇覺悟的第三點。</p>

<h3>Two Major Avenues for Idle Capital Outlets</h3>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, funds from various regions have flocked to Shanghai, forming the largest pool of idle capital in the country. Naturally, this accumulated idle capital is not content to remain stagnant and seeks outlets at all times. Initially, the purpose of these outlets was to ensure the safety of their own funds and obtain modest profits, such as depositing funds in banks to earn interest or engaging in small-scale commercial operations. Later, as idle capital accumulated further and the desire for profit grew without limit, there was a gradual attempt to obtain exorbitant profits. Consequently, there was a tendency toward speculation in foreign exchange hedging and even hoarding for manipulation. If one person profited, everyone followed suit. As idle capital became more rampant, speculative activities flourished, leading to a chaotic market, distorted prosperity, and soaring prices, benefiting a few while causing suffering to the majority.</p>
<p>Looking back at Shanghai society in recent years, which has also significantly influenced various parts of the country, the free flow of rampant idle capital, unable to find a normal channel of destination, has stirred up a storm, leaving no peaceful day. After reflecting on the pain, the question of how to formulate effective countermeasures for absorption in the future relies on the government's overall leadership from above, the full cooperation of all sectors of society, especially the economic sector, and the unified support of the masses, working together to ensure that idle capital not only does not cause harm like floods and fierce beasts but is also utilized as a vital force for industrial revival. This responsibility cannot be shirked by the government and the people but must be shouldered together to promote progress.</p>
<p>In the past few years, due to the complexity of the environment and the ever-changing situation, idle capital, being the most sensitive, surveyed the landscape and found no reliable and permanent destination. Therefore, it adopted a strategy of wandering and seeking profits, taking a chance for a while. This fact has its objective factors that contributed to it. Today, the situation is generally determined and not prone to unpredictable changes, and the environment is also free of complex phenomena. Therefore, those who hold idle capital must recognize this fact and abandon the concept of hoarding goods for exorbitant profits. Because this approach, the "golden age" has passed, and even if you hoard, there will never be exorbitant profits to be gained again. Moreover, the government has explicitly prohibited it, and materials are under strict control. Why willingly risk breaking the law and engaging in risky ventures for "things beyond what is needed for life"? Why be happy alone while others suffer? Society will one day be stable, and the country will one day be revived. Why should I be a sinner in stability and revival! Perhaps some hold the view that even if I don't do it, others will still do it, and it's all in vain. This view is most undesirable. Once this view is held, there is no hope for improvement in anything, and all evils arise from this. The reason why our national affairs are so chaotic is that there are many compatriots who hold this view, which is truly lamentable! Therefore, we hope that holders of idle capital—including individuals and organizations—will henceforth use their funds in legitimate ways, lower their desire for profit, and raise their awareness of the country and society. Only when the country is revived can your funds truly be guaranteed and enjoyed; otherwise, when the nest is overturned, there will be no intact eggs. What good is a rolling fortune?</p>
<p>It seems that we have said a lot of empty words above. In fact, we believe that only by establishing a strong and correct foundation in everyone's mind can we achieve things that are not only for personal gain but also for the benefit of the country and society. Here, we present two major avenues for idle capital:</p>
<p>First, invest in national bonds, such as bonds, lottery tickets, and savings bonds issued by the state. When the state levies fees from the people for legitimate needs, the people have an absolute obligation to subscribe. On the one hand, the government should carefully consider the legitimacy of the use and the guarantee of benefits beforehand, and once a decision is made, the people should enthusiastically follow suit. For example, the welfare lottery tickets and food warehouse receipts recently issued by the government are intended to encourage people to save, allowing currency to flow back, control inflation, and indirectly suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. Since the government considers the people, the people should support the government. Moreover, national savings are a powerful pillar for the country to adjust its finances. The country with the highest national savings rate in the world is the country with the highest patriotic sentiment among its citizens and the country with the easiest ability to exert united strength. Although the profit from savings is not as high as speculation, the interests of the country are greater than the interests of individuals. Therefore, we hope that holders of idle capital will invest as much as possible in national bonds.</p>
<p>Second, invest in productive enterprises. The scope of productive enterprises is quite broad, with types such as agriculture, industry, and mining, and natures such as state-owned, public-owned, and private-owned, but all fall within the scope of the country's economic construction. In this regard, we believe that the government should have an overall economic construction plan, categorized and organized by time and location. The National Economic Commission should have this responsibility. On the one hand, it turns a blind eye and allows idle capital to flow into speculation and curses it; on the other hand, it fails to plan channels for its destination. This blame should not be shirked. As for methods, there are many, such as the government coming forward to organize large-scale enterprise companies to absorb idle capital and engage in production; allowing the people to take over or jointly operate state-owned enterprises that have achieved success, while the government establishes new ones; rewarding and assisting the people in establishing large-scale enterprise companies to absorb idle capital; formulating plans for private enterprises that have achieved success but still need to expand and publicly soliciting idle capital, etc., are all productive enterprises that can absorb a large amount of idle capital.</p>
<p>In short, the most reliable and permanent outlets for idle capital are the two avenues mentioned above, and the core lies in holders of idle capital recognizing the importance of individual interests versus national interests. Do not be blinded by exorbitant profits and immediate gains, do not indulge in personal desires, and take care of the public and the country. At the same time, we also hope that the government authorities will value the power of idle capital and plan strategies for its utilization, taking the protection of the people's interests and the removal of the people's doubts as a prerequisite, so that this considerable idle capital will not be a boil that harms society but will become a huge force for stabilizing national finances and revitalizing the country's industry. Then the country, society, and the people will all benefit from it. How fortunate it would be!</p>

<h3>Japanese Naval Air Force Launches Major Attack on Russell Island, Downing 49 Enemy Aircraft in Air Battle</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5 p.m. today: On the 7th, the Imperial Naval Air Force dispatched a large squadron of fighters to attack Russell Island (located in the central Solomon Islands). They frequently encountered enemy aircraft over the area and engaged in fierce air battles. As a result, 49 enemy aircraft were shot down, while six of our aircraft did not return to base.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy Department announced on the 8th that a strong Japanese air force had attacked U.S. military positions on Russell Island on the morning of the 6th. U.S. fighters lost seven aircraft in the ensuing battle.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Naval Air Observation Unit previously attacked enemy aircraft on Santa Ana Island, shooting down 20 of them and achieving a great victory. On the morning of the 8th, a large squadron of fighters departed from a certain base and launched a strong attack on Russell Island, an important base. Enemy aircraft engaged in an unprecedented large-scale air battle. As a result, 49 enemy aircraft were shot down, achieving another great victory. On that day, the large Japanese aircraft formation, filled with the determination to destroy the enemy, advanced towards the enemy's base. Before even reaching Russell Island, Japanese aircraft were already waiting in ambush over Ganasca Island, so the enemy aircraft became easy prey for the Japanese aircraft as soon as they flew in, and eight enemy aircraft were shot down in an instant. Later, when Japanese aircraft reached the airspace above the enemy's base on Russell Island, they engaged in fierce air battles with newly equipped enemy Vought Sikorsky (b4u) aircraft, Curtiss (p4o) aircraft, and Giant (g3t) aircraft. Japanese aircraft shot down 49 enemy aircraft. In the meantime, the Japanese aircraft still had ample strength, so they fiercely bombed the enemy's airfield hangars and other military facilities, inflicting heavy damage. In this battle, six Japanese aircraft failed to return to their original defense. Regarding the U.S. losses in this air battle, the U.S. Navy Department announced that only seven aircraft were lost, which is their usual trick to cover up the facts. Therefore, the enemy's vigorous propaganda that their losses are few only proves the intensity of the Japanese air force's attack.</p>

<h3>Hankow Naval Base Command Holds Inauguration Ceremony Today, Naval Headquarters Sends Zhao Guizhang to Hankow to Preside</h3>
<p>Hankow, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Hankow Naval Base Command, actively prepared by Commander Meng Xiuzhuang, is finally ready and will hold its inauguration ceremony today (the 10th). Naval Headquarters specially sent Deputy Naval Minister Zhao Guizhang to Hankow to preside, accompanied by Commander Yin Zuqian and Templeoka Akira. The details of the ceremony are as follows: (1) Commander's report, (2) Chairman's training speech, (3) Naval Minister's training speech, (4) Friendly Navy Officer's training speech, etc. After the ceremony, the military band will play music, and all naval officers and soldiers will conduct their first large-scale land march to celebrate. Also, it is reported that after Deputy Naval Minister Zhao Guizhang arrived in Hankow yesterday, he separately visited provincial and municipal authorities and friendly naval authorities. When the reporter paid a special visit, he was honored to hear the following remarks: The establishment of the Hankow Base Command was originally intended to be personally presided over by Minister Bu Duomu, but due to the busy political affairs, I was sent to Hankow to represent him. Wuhan is located in an important strategic area of the Yangtze River and is considered a military stronghold. It is particularly important during the Greater East Asia War. The army's defenses are already very solid, so it is necessary for the navy to establish defenses as well. Since the National Government returned to the capital, the navy has been actively developing, establishing important port commands in Nanjing, Weihaiwei, and Guangzhou. This time, thanks to the assistance of friendly countries and provincial and municipal leaders, the Naval Headquarters was able to establish a base command in Hankow. Our department expresses its sincere gratitude to friendly countries and provincial and municipal leaders.</p>

<h3>Ways of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation (II) Promoting Controlled Economic Cooperation, Preventing Capital Concentration in Concessions – Wu Zhenxiu</h3>
<p>Concessions and extraterritoriality are major constraints on China's politics and economy. Crimes committed in concessions under the protection of extraterritoriality are well-known. Of course, concessions are also the safest places for life, property, and capital. Even today, some Chinese still think this way, so only the concessions have concentrated capital, and only the concessions have become fertile ground. Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places are all like this. This kind of development that is biased towards the coastal areas can be said to be a distorted development for the entire Chinese economy.</p>
<p>Now, the implementation of recovering concessions and extraterritoriality is truly gratifying for the political and economic development of China, and this is what I hope for. In the future, even if the coastal cities that have concessions become a little thinner, it doesn't matter, because it can promote the development of various inland areas (referring to the inland of the coastal cities), and the banks of the inland rivers or the areas along the railways can all achieve balanced materials and the same development. In the future, Shanghai will of course still be in the central position of control and will gradually develop. However, China's past economy has not developed, and China cannot develop soundly, let alone develop from an ancient country to a new country, and then to a modern country. Regarding the progress of the Commercial Control Association, we have recently been discussing the establishment of local federations of lower-level organizations. We will of course do our best to operate the Commercial Control Association, but the future is not easy.</p>
<p>First, controlled economy has no precedent in China and almost no experience. The so-called controlled knowledge is only a slight study of Japanese things, so it is somewhat reluctant for us to do it. Although this time it was handed over to us to handle ourselves because of the new Sino-Japanese policy, we still have to ask Japan for assistance in the places where our strength is not enough. Second, the objective conditions surrounding the Commercial Control Association are not necessarily good. In a nutshell, China's current situation has neither an old organization nor a new one. The reason for this situation cannot be denied: it was caused by September 18th, August 13th, and the Greater East Asia War, and for decades, under the system of gentry, farmers, workers, and merchants, industry was primitive. From the old organization era that focused solely on agriculture until the period of trade with foreign countries and up to the present, there have been countless changes in the middle. Under these circumstances, it is not easy to accomplish a new and major task. If Japan encountered this situation, there would still be ways to think about it, but the Chinese side feels greatly troubled.</p>
<p>The current problem of the Commercial Control Association is how to control the materials in Shanghai. I think that if Shanghai's materials had been purchased after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th, the situation would have been more optimistic. However, after December 8th, Shanghai's materials all flowed to the people, and the prices also rose sharply, and the Commercial Control Association was established at this very troublesome time. I hope the Japanese side also considers this situation.</p>
<p>Of course, it is necessary to severely crack down on speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, especially those hoarding behaviors that seek exorbitant profits, which must not be allowed to exist. If only a part of the speculators and hoarders are exposed, it will not only fail to eradicate them but will also produce the opposite effect. Shanghai has a population of over 4.5 million, among which only a very small number are engaged in large-scale speculation and hoarding. I think that for these people, in addition to what they need for their lives, all the materials should be returned to the Commercial Control Association and handed over to the government. First, we should have a cordial talk with them about this idea. If they still do not agree no matter what you say, then wouldn't it be a very good method to ask this person to leave Shanghai?</p>
<p>The most necessary thing in Shanghai is to increase business. Regarding this point, the enemy properties that have been transferred by the Japanese side to the Tong government should be handed over to private individuals to manage as soon as possible if they are suitable for private management, so as to strive to increase production. Although it is said that it should be handed over to private individuals to do, it would be useless to call someone who has no real experience in running a business to do it.</p>
<p>In the military, the restriction on the movement of materials has been eased, and the control of materials is handled by China itself. This is something to be happy and grateful for. But there is still one problem, which is the smooth circulation of materials between Central China and North China. For example, we are very concerned about the food problem in North China from the perspective of people's livelihood. For example, the price of coal in Central China is surprisingly high, while it is very cheap in North China. It is not a good phenomenon that goods are coming from North China, but not from Central China. This price difference should be adjusted. However, due to the past situation between North China and Central China, it is impossible to seek free trade at once. I think we should first exchange two or three kinds of materials, take a look at the situation, and then make adjustments, step by step. Finally, I would like to say one more sentence. In the current world, it is always the people in the guiding position who think this way: "This is why we have to do this, because it is necessary, it is natural, so we have to do this." For example, the transfer from free economy to controlled economy is a natural thing at present, and it is necessary to do so. From a fair point of view, I don't think the people who do it are unreasonable. However, from a fair point of view, there are indeed difficulties for the controlled party. The environment that the Commercial Control Association faces can also be said to be like this, so in all matters, we must consider the guide and the guided, consider both the controlled side and the controlled side, so as to achieve perfection and fairness.

<h3>Tokyo Holds National Convention: Issues Declaration Urging National Public to Rise Up and Fulfill the Unfinished Aspirations of the Patriotic Soldiers</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - After learning of the heroic martyrdom of Marshal Yamamoto and the honorable deaths of all Japanese troops on Attu Island, the emotions of Japan's 100 million citizens reached a fever pitch. The Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the Assistance Political Association, the Tokyo Municipal Government, and other organizations jointly launched a "National Convention for Decisive Battle to Destroy Britain and America." With the support of the Mainichi, Asahi, and Yomiuri Shimbun newspapers, the Tokyo National Convention was grandly held at the Hibiya Public Hall at 2:00 PM on the 9th. After ceremonial procedures, Goto Fumio, Vice-President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, delivered a congratulatory address. Subsequently, General Abe Nobuyuki, President of the Assistance Political Association, was elected as Chairman of the Convention. Then, Mr. Matsuda Takechiyo, Vice-Chairman of the Assistance Political Association's Diet Members' Association, read aloud the convention's declaration and resolution, which were unanimously approved by the entire assembly. Afterwards, Speaker Okada of the House of Representatives and Mr. Shimomura Hiro, Director-General of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, successively delivered speeches encouraging the national public to rise up and promote the spirit of "destroying Britain and America until the task is completed." The meeting adjourned at 2:45 PM. The gist of the convention's declaration is as follows: "Since the start of the war, the glorious achievements of the Japanese military have been sufficient to be forever etched in history. However, the great task of constructing Greater East Asia is still in its early stages. At this decisive moment, now is the time for all our citizens to devote their utmost loyalty and patriotism to the nation and strive to achieve the final victory. More than a year has passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and many of our loyal and brave soldiers have embraced the spirit of sacrificing their lives for the nation and their sovereign. This time, Marshal Yamamoto, who commanded Japan's invincible navy and demonstrated its divine might throughout the universe, heroically martyred himself in the front lines while supervising the battle. The Japanese garrison on Attu Island, outnumbered by the enemy, fought to the last man. Their sincerity and devotion are enough to astonish heaven and earth and move even the gods to tears. When we think back to the ferocity of this battle and the loyalty and bravery of our soldiers, our blood cannot help but boil, and our resolve is strengthened. Feelings of enmity towards the enemy and the determination to sacrifice ourselves for the nation arise spontaneously. We vow to devote all our strength to enhance all war capabilities, overcome all difficulties, and resolutely destroy Britain and America to avenge this loss and fulfill the unfinished aspirations of the patriotic soldiers, while simultaneously completing the great task of the nation and reassuring the Emperor."</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Hidaka, Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Rome, 9th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Hidaka, met with a group of Italian reporters on the 8th and strongly asserted that Japan has established a decisive system to cope with the current world war situation. He stated, in essence, that Japan is prepared to deal with any unexpected circumstances that may arise and is currently striving to maintain coordination with the various countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. He claimed the peoples of those countries are already enjoying genuine freedom. Furthermore, Japan is continuing its operations against Chongqing. The recent participation of Chongqing generals in the peace movement proves that Japan's plans to advance against Chongqing are steadily succeeding. As for Churchill and Roosevelt discussing in their recent Washington conference whether to focus the main thrust of the anti-Axis forces on Europe or East Asia, such plans are difficult to implement and are not worth paying attention to.</p>
<h3>US Air Force Strength Weak: Japan Controls the Skies</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, the Japanese Army Air Force has been bravely operating on the Central China front to destroy the US forces stationed in Chongqing. Since January, they have repeatedly carried out strong attacks, crushing the enemy's counter-offensive attempts. Therefore, at the current stage, whether the US Air Force can carry out its wild boast of bombing Japan is being examined. The opinions of local Japanese air force personnel are summarized as follows: According to a certain unit commander of the bomber forces, technically speaking, it may be possible to attack the Japanese mainland from Kunming and other places. However, because Japan controls the air over its forward bases, the US Air Force in Chongqing has no hope of survival. The operational radius of the enemy's "Unified Type" (1324) aircraft is only about 300 kilometers, and its maximum performance is so poor that its range of operations is limited. The performance of the enemy's "North American Type" (1325) aircraft is even worse. The main issue is the morale of the unit, as the enemy only knows how to escape and lacks a proactive attitude. Therefore, they have no brave spirit to overcome all difficulties and bomb the Japanese mainland. According to a certain unit commander of the fighter forces, the performance of the enemy's fighter planes (P-40 and P-43) is not to be feared. Even with auxiliary fuel tanks, their operational radius is only about 1,000 kilometers. It is impossible to form a fighter-bomber formation with such aircraft. If bombers were to carry out sneak attacks alone, they would be shot down by Japanese fighters defending the homeland. Although the morale of the US military is better than last year, they only dare to adopt a group warfare tactic and attack when they have a large numerical advantage over the Japanese. If their numbers are the same as or less than the Japanese, they have almost no courage to fight. (According to a certain unit commander of the reconnaissance plane unit, because of the continuous fierce attacks by Japanese planes, the enemy is currently trying to counterattack, but they only occasionally appear at intermediate bases such as Liangshan, Enshi, and Hengyang before fleeing inland. Judging from the current situation, enemy planes do not seem capable of challenging the Japanese. Long-range bombers such as the B-17 have not yet appeared. If they were to attack, the Japanese would certainly retaliate fiercely. Currently, the morale of the Japanese military is very high, and they all have a strong belief.</p>
<h3>Javanese Young Police Officers Sent to Taiwan for Study</h3>
<p>Guakaruta, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Military Administration Department of Java considers it an urgent task to improve the quality of indigenous police officers. In order to develop promising young cadre police officers, this time, ten outstanding police officers from the backbone cadre were specially selected and sent to the Japanese Police School in Taiwan for study. The study period is set for two months, and they are currently undergoing preparatory training at the Police School in Sukabumi.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Analyzes the Trends of Various Neutral Countries</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Nagoya (Chubu Nihon Shimbun) on the 9th wrote an article entitled "The Trends of Neutral Countries," analyzing the current trends of various neutral countries with great accuracy. The gist of the translation is as follows: "During this autumn of world war, there are still seven countries around the world that maintain their neutral or non-belligerent status, namely Argentina in South America, Afghanistan and Turkey in West Asia, Spain and Portugal in the Iberian Peninsula, Switzerland in Central Europe, and Sweden in Northern Europe. The common hope of all these countries is to avoid directly entering the vortex of war and to hope to save this world from the flames of war. However, if we examine the nature of this war, we can see that this war is nothing more than a superficial conflict of interests between the Axis and anti-Axis camps. Its root cause is actually a struggle between the old and new worlds. For more than twenty years since the last world war, the so-called victorious countries such as Britain, the United States, and France have artificially created an unnatural old world order, which has now begun to collapse from within. Therefore, there is a movement to adapt to this situation and strive to build a new world order, which is to rationally distribute and organize the world's land, population, and resources according to natural conditions. Although this work has its gains and losses in armed warfare and diplomatic warfare, it must also be pursued with determination. This is the mainstream that is spreading throughout the world in this great war. If this is the case, then today's neutral countries may not be able to remain aloof from this mainstream forever. Or, before they themselves participate in this world revolution, the world situation may no longer allow them to maintain their isolationist attitude. This is only natural. If Britain and the United States increase their troops in West Asia, then Afghanistan and Turkey will lean towards Britain and the United States. Also, in the current stage of the European war, it is inevitable that Argentina shows goodwill to the United States, just as Sweden approaches Germany. As for the positions of Spain and Portugal, they are indeed unusually subtle, which cannot be denied. In short, the trends of today's neutral countries can no longer be determined by their own intentions, but are entirely determined by the direction of the world war. The statements made by the authorities in charge of each neutral country often imply a conflict between their own lack of will and the objective situation, as well as deep distress. Therefore, if we carefully examine their statements, we can easily understand the situation. Thus, the trends of today's neutral countries are a reflection of the current world situation."</p>
<h3>Conflicting Interests Between Britain and America Regarding Argentina</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Argentine government has issued only a very simple statement regarding the new government's foreign policy, stating that it will maintain neutrality for the time being. Behind this statement of maintaining neutrality, one can further discern the complex interests of Britain and the United States in that country. The United States, given the current situation of the world war, is doing everything possible to make Argentina abandon its neutrality and place it under its sphere of influence, and make it share the burden of the war. However, Britain hopes that the country will remain neutral, and the reason is that the existing imperialist rights and interests of Britain in that country are more advantageous than those of the United States and other countries. Economically, British capital accounts for a large proportion of Argentina's railways, telecommunications, electricity, gas, refrigeration, meat processing plants, and other industries. Argentina's economic dependence on Britain and European countries is beyond general imagination. Therefore, if Argentina abandons its neutrality, it will lose its freedom of navigation in the Atlantic, which would be a significant blow to Britain. Due to the extreme causes mentioned above, the interests of Britain and the United States are in complete opposition.</p>
<h3>The Voice of Scientific Victory (4): Resources Beneath Fossils: Mobilizing Geologists to Develop the South</h3>
<p>The war industry has completely entered the stage of attrition warfare. In order to achieve victory, everything must be used effectively. The vast territory of East Asia contains inexhaustible resources, which are eagerly awaiting development. Minerals such as iron, coal, petroleum, bauxite, and tin are indispensable materials for war. Therefore, the development of unlimited underground resources is immediately driving the war effort, accumulating strength for the victorious Greater East Asia War. However, the discovery of these underground resources in East Asia is by no means the result of accidental dominance. In order to discover these minerals, countless years of scientific exploration have been spent. How was the secret potential war power of East Asia that appears before our eyes obtained? This requires geology to give us an answer.</p>
<p>"What do most people in the world think of geologists and paleohistologists who obsessively study seemingly unremarkable fossils, forgetting to eat and sleep, exhausting their minds?" "Some people must be thinking that fossil research, which has nothing to do with war, is of no benefit at all to the great war at the critical moment of national survival. But this idea is wrong. In the South? In Manchuria? In China? How great has been the efficiency of bringing underground resources to the surface continuously? Geology is just like a fitter in a black country airplane."</p>
<p>The one who said this was Professor Kato Takeo, Doctor of Science, Dean of the Faculty of Science and member of the Academy of Japan, Tokyo Imperial University, the author of "Research on East Asian Geology and Research on Underground Resources."</p>
<p>"The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which has a very vast area, is formed by the East Asian continent adjacent to Manchuria and the Japanese archipelago near it, and the East Indian islands. Materially speaking, their origin and history of change are different, and meteorologically speaking, they include frigid, temperate, and tropical zones. This inevitably leads to differences in the abundant above-ground and underground resources of East Asia. However, the previous development was really unsatisfactory. The biggest causative factor is that the knowledge of fundamental geology is too threatened, and its exploratory power is very insufficient. So why is it necessary to study things like fossils in order to explore underground resources? Let us give two or three examples to illustrate this point."</p>
<p>Metal ore beds</p>
<p>The geology of the continent and the archipelago has its own differences. Gold ore and metals are also affected by their land endorsements, and their constituent elements must also be different. Generally speaking, in the deep depths of the continental zone, gold ore and iron ore beds are very numerous. This is not found in island areas. So why are there such ore veins on the archipelago? This is entirely due to the influence of volcanoes, so in the shallow depths of the archipelago, there are more gold, silver, and copper ore veins, and fewer iron ore veins.</p>
<p>Bauxite</p>
<p>The weathering effect in ancient times in the southern zone was very serious, so the rock and stone disintegrated to become red soil. When this red soil was formed, the iron and vanadium contained in the original rock gradually dissolved and precipitated into the soil, thus becoming iron ore and bauxite.</p>
<p>Tin</p>
<p>At a certain local time, when granite collapsed in the south, the tin attached to the shared garden later became tin ore. Moreover, in the belt area, this kind of parrot ore bed decomposes due to natural action and turns into scraps of vermilion and flows into the sand, and precipitates in the sand ore.</p>
<p>Petroleum</p>
<p>In terms of the Earth-selling policy, the Tertiary period (my study of science is a relatively new era), the places where there are many petroleum mines today were all shallow seas. Sand and sediment accumulated and precipitated on this seabed to become layers of centimeters, and biological remains were mixed in this release of land accumulation. The remains of the north and another layer of sand and settlement organisms were dried by nature to become media oil. Later, this seabed belt became land and became a coal oil pool, forming a stratum, and the specialized name for the wrinkled skin that protrudes in this stratum is the inclining part, with coal gas at the top, coal oil below, and water below. Therefore, if you make holes in this kind of inclining structure part, it will definitely spray out oil. This is the compilation theory derived from Earth-related studies. Fossils are the relics of organisms in the world that have sunk into the strata. Therefore, if we carefully examine it, we can judge which resource is hidden in the underground in the layer of the first epoch by discovering this kind of fossil. In some places in Manchuria and China, quasi-ground protrudes, containing a certain special fossil of the Ordovician three-gray rock. If you excavate near this kind of protrusion, you will definitely discover coal. Underground resources are so gold-leasing related to fossils. Therefore, the more progressive the study of fossils, the more progressive paleontology, geological tectonics, geo-history, basic geology, and attribution will be. Once we understand the reason for the existence of resources such as those mentioned above, then we will work hard to develop underground resources. The current development of underground resources must be based on geological theory. Therefore, in the future, with the increasingly progressive geology, we will continue to develop undeveloped underground resources to prepare for the flexible use of tomorrow's combat power.

<h3>Axis Forces Heavily Defend Mediterranean Islands: British Troops Fail to Land on Lampedusa Island: US Air Force Concentrates on Bombing the Balkans</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - A military reporter from the German News Agency recently reported on the attempt by anti-Axis forces to land on Lampedusa Island in the Mediterranean Sea, stating that the attempt by anti-Axis forces to land on Lampedusa was the first step in an attempt to invade the Italian mainland, but it was heavily defeated by the Italian defense forces and ultimately failed. The British troops attempting to land this time had received special training, and all of them were armed with automatic rifles. The troop strength was approximately one battalion. The island has an area of only twenty square kilometers and is located two hundred kilometers from the southern tip of Sicily. Although the island's fortress is far less solid than Malta and Pantelleria, the Italian army annihilated all of the enemy troops attempting to land in just a few hours. The anti-Axis forces' landing on the island was aimed at testing the Italian army's defense capabilities.</p>
<p>Rome, 9th (Central News Agency) - Since British Prime Minister Churchill returned to London, the British newspapers have frequently reported that the anti-Axis forces will launch a new operation on the European continent. And since the British army's attempted landing operation on Lampedusa Island south of Sicily, the war situation in the Mediterranean has suddenly become tight. Although this landing operation by the British army failed due to the brave counterattack of the Italian army, the anti-Axis air force has been bombing Pantelleria Island, Sicily Island, and Sardinia Island, which are the outposts of the Italian mainland, for days, so it is expected that the anti-Axis forces will attempt to carry out landing operations on these islands again. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces' plan to counterattack the Mediterranean islands is beyond doubt. It is reported that the United States Air Force is now also assembling on Cyprus Island, attempting to bomb the Balkan Peninsula, with an emphasis on bombing western Greece. This move may be a prerequisite for counterattacking the Dodecanese Islands and Crete. It is observed that the intention of the Axis forces is to recapture the above-mentioned islands, so that they can obtain a base for landing operations in Europe, and at the same time open up the waterway in the Mediterranean Sea, so as to strengthen the assistance to the Soviet army on the Eastern Front, and ensure the transportation route to India. Therefore, the Italian Army Headquarters is fully fortifying the key coastal areas in order to prevent the anti-Axis forces from landing, and is also strengthening the garrison and laying mines to form a tight defense line.</p>
<p>Rome, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Army Headquarters issued a war report on the 9th, stating that the anti-Axis forces bombarded Pantelleria Island with both naval and air forces on the 8th, and then advised the Italian garrison on the island to surrender, which was severely rejected.</p>
<p>Rome, 9th (Central News Agency) - Yesterday, responsible parties here declared that the anti-aircraft artillery and coastal artillery gunners on Pantelleria Island are all manned by Fascist militias, and the command is also held by officers of the militia. The accurate shooting of the coastal artillery gunners forced the attacking British battleships to cease fire, and the skill of the anti-aircraft gunners was equally astonishing. According to the Italian war report announced yesterday, no less than one hundred enemy planes were shot down on the island, and the militia also suffered some casualties.</p>
<h3>Churchill's Speech Claims Major War Imminent: Acknowledges Submarine Threat Remains Serious</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to London sources, British Prime Minister Churchill admitted in the House of Commons yesterday that Britain's main concern is the effectiveness of the Axis submarine warfare and the heavy losses of anti-Axis ships. Churchill also hinted that sooner or later there will be a major war. At the same time, Churchill also stressed that in the battle of Tunisia, the British First Army and Eighth Army suffered serious losses. Churchill did not discuss the development of the near future in detail, but only said that "a very complex and dangerous large-scale naval and land war is imminent." Churchill also said that the Soviet army is fighting a desperate battle, and there will soon be a large-scale battle on the Eastern Front. But we have not been able to contact Stalin or other representatives of the Soviet Union, which we deeply regret. The Soviet Union bears the greatest responsibility and sacrifices the most flesh and blood. Each Allied country has a different point of view on the war, but we British continue to regard the war against submarines as the top priority, because we must conquer submarines before we can survive and act. The situation in May was one of the best months since the United States joined the war. Churchill went on to mention the meeting he held in Washington, saying that his relationship with President Roosevelt has become a personal friendship, and a comrade and partner in thought and action. Churchill also discussed the situation in North Africa in detail, saying that the anti-Axis losses in Tunisia were serious. After crossing the Libyan front, the British Eighth Army under General Montgomery lost 11,500 people, and the British First Army under General Anderson lost 23,500 people. The Prime Minister also said that his visit to North Africa had no political nature. He said, "When I was in Algiers, de Gaulle happened to arrive with his friends, so I specially telegraphed Foreign Secretary Eden to assist. In the negotiations to organize the so-called French National Liberation Committee, we had no need to intervene. But we, like General Eisenhower, are paying close attention to safeguarding the interests of Britain and the United States and the welfare of our troops stationed in North Africa. The Prime Minister did not mention the order of the war zones and future operations in his speech.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to Algiers, the North African French Liberation Committee announced on the 9th that it had decided to appoint Giraud as the commander-in-chief of the army, navy, and air force, commanding all military affairs, and de Gaulle would be in charge of general political affairs.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to Algiers, the French National Liberation Committee has added seven more members. According to US radio broadcasts, three of them are from de Gaulle's faction, three are from Giraud's faction, and one is a neutral.</p>
<h3>Britain to Increase Diplomatic Staff in Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports that the British diplomatic representative in Moscow will soon be increased, and Britain will first decide to send one ambassador and one minister to the Soviet Union. The position of minister will be filled by Balfour, who previously served as minister to Portugal.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Encircled in Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Zagreb, 9th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports that guerrillas in Bosnia and Herzegovina are now completely surrounded by Axis forces in Montenegro, and fighting is still ongoing. The guerrillas' plan to break out of the encirclement has failed, with heavy casualties.</p>
<h3>Turkey Maintains Armed Neutrality in the Current Stage of the European War: Clear Statement by President Ismet</h3>
<p>Ankara, 9th (Central News Agency) - Turkish President Ismet, at the opening of the 6th Congress of the Republican People's Party yesterday, stated that the Turkish government is determined to maintain its neutrality in the current stage of the World War. The President stated: "We firmly guarantee the security of our country, and if necessary for self-defense, we are also prepared to fight with all our strength. It is impossible to predict when and under what circumstances this war will end, but we believe that peace will come in the near future. The President continued to say that Turkish finance is currently in unprecedented demand, and the government is taking various appropriate measures to cope with it. The President also expressed the hope that the public should pay more direct attention to internal affairs than in the past, and should especially strictly select those in power. Only in this way can the trust between the public and the government be maintained, and the government can make decisions. The contribution of the Republican People's Party in this regard is commendable, and the parliament should take it as law. After instructing the party's future work, the President said that the true happiness of the people can only be sought in serving the country."</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister to the Soviet Union Returns to Kuibyshev</h3>
<p>Kuibyshev, 9th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister to the Soviet Union, Shigeno Goro, who previously decided to return home to report on his duties, returned to Kuibyshev on the 8th and is scheduled to go to Moscow on the 10th.</p>
<h3>US Explosives Factory Explodes</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports that the Triumph Explosives Factory in Elkton, Maryland, suddenly exploded, killing at least 125 female workers and injuring countless others. Most of the bodies are unrecognizable. Windows and doors throughout the town of Elkton were shattered. The factory has more than 10,000 workers. The cause of the accident is unknown. The former managers of the factory are both on trial in court for fraud.</p>
<h3>Marshal Dönitz Discusses with Assurance of Final Victory</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent from Berlin, 31st Dispatches) Naval Chief Marshal Dönitz of Germany is equivalent to the Minister of the Navy and Chief of the Naval General Staff of Japan. At the same time, he also holds a position similar to the Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District, directly commanding the German U-boat fleet that traverses the world's oceans. He is the number one figure in the German Navy. The reporter raised questions about the joint operations of the Japanese and German navies, the development of U-boat warfare, and other issues, requesting an interview with Marshal Dönitz. Despite his busy military affairs, he agreed to meet with the reporter on May 31st. Since Marshal Dönitz assumed the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, this was his first meeting with domestic and foreign journalists. The reporter, accompanied by Major Fujimura of the Japanese Naval Attaché's Office, visited the office of the German Navy Minister at 10:00 a.m. that day. Marshal Dönitz is a tall and sturdy man, 52 years old this year, 16 years younger than his predecessor, Raeder. When he shook hands with the reporter, he seemed to be a man of few words at first glance, but his warmth overflowed from his expression. The following is the Q&amp;A between Marshal Dönitz and the reporter.</p>
<p>Striving for Initiative</p>
<p>Marshal Dönitz said: "All of us German naval officers and soldiers are deeply moved by the patriotic sacrifice of Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto of the Combined Fleet. The achievements of the Japanese Navy in this war, announced on the Japanese Naval Battle Memorial Day, are a monument to Marshal Yamamoto's great achievements that will be passed down through the ages. In my telegram to the Japanese Navy, I conveyed our admiration and trust in the Japanese Navy to your country, which was expressed out of sincere emotion. I am very honored to have received earnest replies from Minister of the Navy Shimada and Chief of the Naval General Staff Nagano."</p>
<p>Marshal Dönitz then changed the subject and expressed his aspirations for the current naval warfare. He described how the German Navy, which was just starting to be built when Britain and France declared war on Germany, overcame various unfavorable circumstances.</p>
<p>Marshal Dönitz continued, "You have been stationed in Germany as a veteran journalist since before the war, so you probably understand very well that the small navy, which was still in its infancy of reconstruction at that time, was forced to fight against Britain. Even in the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, the British and French fleets had more than ten times the strength of ours. But we were not afraid of this great enemy. From the first day of the war, our navy took lightning action to seize the initiative of attack from the enemy, surprise-attacked the heart of Britain, the Scapa Flow naval port, and laid mines along the British coast. We dispatched submarines, battleships, and cruisers to the distant oceans, and occupied the enemy's landing place, the coast of Norway, creating a posture of threatening the British mainland from the north. On the southern flank of the British mainland, thanks to the miraculous surprise attack of our army and air force, we obtained a strategically important base on the Atlantic coast. Based on this Atlantic coast, our submarines were able to operate continuously and threaten the enemy's lifeline. The achievements of our submarines are self-evident and I won’t repeat them here. Just when this submarine warfare was accelerating the threat to the British mainland, the United States thought that Japan could be deceived and coerced, and finally joined the war. This was a fundamental misjudgment of the enemy camp. We Germans have always remembered with admiration and amazement Japan's resolute determination and powerful force in attacking the arrogance of the United States at that time."</p>
<p>The reporter here expressed his congratulations on the close cooperation among the countries centered on the Tripartite Pact in the current major war situation, and expressed his boundless joy in the greatness of the German U-boat fleet. Marshal Dönitz then spoke with a knowing smile, stating the following meaningful remarks!</p>
<p>"As you said, if we combine the great achievements of the Japanese Navy in the Pacific Ocean with the achievements of the German U-boats in the Atlantic Ocean, we will know where the essence of the decisive battle on the ocean stage in this world war lies. The entire combat power of our Japanese, German, and Italian allied navies is by no means a separate, individual war. We use our unique deployment, appearing suddenly in the east and west, floating unpredictably, to contain and attack British and American warships and merchant ships everywhere, gradually weakening the enemy's power. The effect of this interactive combat of our side's camp ultimately and unequivocally reduces the enemy's power.”</p>
<p>Sinkings Exceed Shipbuilding Capacity</p>
<p>"The total number of enemy ships sunk by our Allied camp so far is, as I recall, 31.5 million tons. I would like to hear your opinion on this submarine warfare." Upon the reporter's inquiry, Marshal Dönitz gave the following answer:</p>
<p>"This figure is sufficient to prove that no matter what defensive tactics the enemy takes, no matter how desperately the enemy builds new ships, it cannot exceed our attack power. We are especially grateful and trust that Japan plays an essentially important role in this achievement of sinking enemy ships, and will continue to do so in the future. However, when discussing the effect of the work of destroying enemy ships in the vast maritime stage, we should consider the overall results of the sinking as the object of discussion. The results of naval battles, which are often dominated by various conditions, sometimes more and sometimes less, are an inevitable phenomenon. The one who determines the victory or defeat of a naval battle is the form in which the final overall result appears. For example, our submarines, day after day, extract blood from the enemy's blood vessels.”</p>
<p>The reporter informed that the enemy has recently been boasting about the progress of its submarine defense tactics, and asked what countermeasures the German Navy has taken.</p>
<p>Marshal Dönitz replied: "The enemy is thinking of escaping, and we are thinking of chasing. Because the enemy wants to find a way to escape, they will naturally come up with various tactics. As for our side, our attack tactics will naturally not stand still and stagnate. Our new tactics and new weapons are also being researched and improved day by day, and are being put into practical use.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the reporter recalled the anecdote of then-Lieutenant Commander Dönitz when he was the commander of a submarine and circumnavigated the Mediterranean Sea into the Atlantic Ocean in 1918. At that time, his superior criticized Dönitz, saying: "I have never seen anyone as ambitious and bold as Dönitz. He sometimes swallows mines, sometimes collides, and sometimes throws himself into the sea. If everyone did as adventurously as Dönitz, all of Germany's submarines would soon be wiped out.”</p>
<p>The reporter continued, "Today is exactly the anniversary of the Battle of Skagerrak, which the German Navy regards as glorious. In the future world war, I would like to hear your beliefs."</p>
<p>Marshal Dönitz replied: "I am confident that the countries in our Allied camp will have an absolutely undefeated spirit and strength in future naval battles. The form of naval battles has changed greatly since the Battle of Skagerrak, and will change even more in the future. However, no matter how different modern naval warfare is from the past in terms of region, strategy, and technology, our purpose is unwavering. At any time, we focus on the same goal, which is to strive for the final victory. This is our supreme goal.”</p>
<p>At this point, the reporter asked Marshal Dönitz what he thought of the spirit of the Japanese soldiers on Attu Island who died for their country. The Marshal said frankly:</p>
<p>"In this just war, the heroic sacrifices of the soldiers are by no means meaningless. The touching aspect of Attu Island lies in this. The spirit of the scholars of ancient Japan still flows in the blood of the Japanese people. The brave Japanese soldiers have once again displayed it to people all over the world here. People who know a little about Japanese history will inevitably imagine how the entire Japanese people will react and what impact it will have on the tragic battle of the Aleutians, far away from their homeland. Under the new commander, Koga, the entire Japanese Combined Fleet and the entire Japanese army will be even more vigorous in their morale and will continue to fight against the enemy. I believe that small disasters will turn into great blessings.”</p>
<p>Marshal Dönitz had just returned to Berlin this morning, and before he could warm his seat, he was about to depart again for the front line. The plane was already waiting to take off. The reporter thanked the Marshal for taking the time to meet him in his busy schedule. The impression gained at the German Naval Headquarters on this day was that the heads of the headquarters, from the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, were very young people. It was felt that after Marshal Dönitz took office as Commander-in-Chief, all the old people had retired. There was no one older than the 52-year-old Commander Dönitz.

<h3>Restricting Consumption of Cotton Products; Adoption of Rationing System; Per Capita Annual Consumption to Be 76 Points; Implementation for Japanese Residents Next Month, Chinese Still Under Consideration</h3>
<p>Regarding restricting the consumption of cotton products and adopting a rationing system, starting with Japanese residents first, scheduled to be implemented next month, the Japanese Embassy, the Japanese Consulate General, and the Resident Group have repeatedly decided on specific measures with the material control authorities. Although the specific method has not yet been finalized, according to inquiries from the Guofeng News Agency reporter, based on the current situation, the method is a coupon rationing system.</p>
<p>Special Allotments for Mothers and Children</p>
<p>This system roughly stipulates that the total annual consumption points per person will be set at 76 points. For example, each towel will be designated as 1 point, a bolt of bleached cloth will be 6 points, and 10 yards of white cotton cloth will be 20 points. Within a year, the minimum number of towels to be allocated is 3. The total number of points for annual consumer goods, regardless of their composition, must not exceed the specified amount. In addition, a special allotment system is being considered for children and mothers. The locations for issuing ration coupons and the designated retail stores that sell rationed cotton products are currently under careful consideration by all relevant parties. The rationed cotton products include 11 types: (1) towels, (2) white cotton cloth, (3) bleached cloth, (4) flannel, (5) cotton yarn and foreign yarn, (6) gauze, (7) absorbent cotton, (8) cloth socks, (9) foreign socks, (10) undershirts, (11) shirts. As for the rationing of cotton products for the Chinese population, it seems to be still in the planning stage.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Minister Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Fiyi Pu, the Bulgarian Minister to Japan and concurrently Minister to China, has been very busy with receptions since arriving in Beijing to present his credentials. The Bulgarian Minister was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai on the 8th and transfer to Japan, but due to other matters, he changed his plan and arrived in Shanghai by train at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (the 9th). In addition to his staff, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also sent Secretary Wang to accompany him to Shanghai. It is said that the Bulgarian Minister will stay at the consulate in Shanghai and then transfer to Japan.</p>
<h3>French Police Assault and Humiliate Judge, Express Compensation and Apology</h3>
<p>Regarding the incident in which the French police officer of the Central District, Pousset, assaulted and humiliated Wang Lansheng, the judge of the Second Special District Court, at the intersection of Route Lafayette on the morning of the 7th of this month, disrespecting the judge and obstructing official duties, it has once again aroused the anger of citizens throughout the city. After the Second Special Court made serious representations to the French police, the French police agreed to provide compensation and an apology. They sent personnel to visit Chief Prosecutor Shen Wenjie of the court to express their apology. They also went to Judge Wang's residence to apologize. However, Judge Wang believed that this matter was related to respecting Chinese justice and was not convenient for him to handle independently, so he did not meet them and refused the apology. Chen Bingjun, the president of the court, has now gone to Beijing on official business and is scheduled to return to Shanghai today. Therefore, the incident must wait until President Chen returns to Shanghai before a suitable solution can be obtained.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Groups' Zhang Case Support Association sent a letter to President Chen of the Second Special District Court yesterday, stating that after the Zhang case trial began on June 7th, the instigator and principal offender, Guo Shiyuan, actually threw paper balls at each other with his attorney. They requested that the lawyer's illegal behavior be punished at the next court session. In addition, the Chinese Confucian Society sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating that Judge Wang Lansheng of the court was humiliated on his way to the court to perform his duties, and requested immediate representations.</p>
<h3>Matricide Case Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>The case of Jiang Lianjiang, a 16-year-old student at Yucai Public School, who killed his 16-year-old classmate Jin Weigang with a sharp blade, was continued yesterday morning by Judge Du Fuyao of the First Special Court in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant Jiang Lianjiang did not appoint a lawyer to defend him. According to the law, the court appointed lawyer Ge Zhaoji as his pro bono defender. Jin Youming, the father of the deceased, appointed lawyer Tao Wuzhi to file a supplementary civil suit, requesting compensation for funeral expenses and other fees totaling 469,799 yuan. Because the defendant is still a minor, his father Jiang Jie'an should be jointly and severally liable for compensation. First, lawyer Zhang Tianyin, representing the police, stated the case. Then, the father of the deceased recounted the process. When questioned, the defendant Jiang Lianjiang stated that he did not bring a knife when he went to the deceased's place. Because the deceased took out a knife to stab him, he grabbed it and stabbed back. He had no premeditated intention to kill. The court, believing that the facts were clear, ordered the start of the debate. Then, lawyer Zhang Tianyin, representing the police, rose to make the accusation, stating that the fact that the deceased was killed by the defendant was an undisputed fact. Although Article 63 of the Criminal Law stipulates that those under the age of 18 or over the age of 80 shall not be sentenced to death or life imprisonment, the police are bound by the law and cannot request that the defendant be sentenced to the death penalty or life imprisonment. The maximum term of imprisonment is 15 years, and if the circumstances are serious, it may be increased at the court's discretion. Therefore, he requested that the court increase the punishment according to the law and sentence him to 20 years of imprisonment. Then, the appointed defense lawyer Ge Zhaoji argued that there was no corroborating evidence to prove that the murder weapon was brought by the defendant, and the defendant insisted that the deceased intended to harm him and he resisted, which belonged to self-defense and was only an excessive defense. Therefore, he requested a lighter sentence. The court then declared the debate closed and scheduled the verdict to be announced next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Conventions for Saving on Banquets; More Letters of Response</h3>
<p>Our newspaper advocates practicing wartime life and saving on consumption, and has launched "Conventions for Saving on Banquets," soliciting participation from all walks of life. In addition to the first batch of letters of consent published in our newspaper on the 8th, we now record the second batch of letters of consent:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Lie Yunqing (Tongren Money Exchange) stated: "Saving on any consumption is not only practicing wartime life, but also cherishing materials in peacetime. I have always adhered to this principle, and will continue to do so in the future with a spirit of integrity and unwavering commitment."</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Wu Xiaohou (Jinan Changyu Salt Manufacturing Company) supplemented: "Ordinary banquets should be based on four dishes and five bowls."</p>
<p>We still hope that all walks of life will jointly practice and send letters to participate.</p>
<h3>Donations for Disaster Relief in North China; Collected by Banks and Money Exchanges; Hope People Will Submit Payments Nearby for Convenience; Our Newspaper Extends Gratitude to All Donors</h3>
<p>People from all walks of life in this city, aware of the severe disaster in North China, the displacement of people, and the unimaginable suffering, who does not have parents, who does not have a wife and children, we are in a comfortable area, what do we think of the disaster victims, rescuing the hungry and helping the drowning, everyone has the same heart, we hope that all compatriots will work hard to donate and fulfill their obligations.</p>
<p>Bank Collection</p>
<p>Now the association, in order to catch up quickly and alleviate the disaster as soon as possible, and to relieve the suffering of the disaster victims, has designated 13 banks and 2 money exchanges to collect relief funds. We hope that all sectors will submit payments nearby to benefit the disaster victims and save them from disaster.</p>
<p>Game Results</p>
<p>The basketball and football charity games for disaster relief in North China, sponsored by the Municipal Government, with the Nanjing Military Team and Shanghai teams performing their best, have been successfully held. They closed the day before yesterday (the 8th). The sales results, excluding the 30,000 yuan of honorary tickets issued and collected, were 4,620 yuan for tickets on the first day (5th), 7,590 yuan on the second day (6th), 4,770 yuan on the third day (7th), and 4,840 yuan on the fourth day (8th). Including the auction of charity balls for four days, the total was 111,820 yuan.</p>
<p>Buddhist Fundraising</p>
<p>The Municipal Buddhist Association, together with temples and Buddhist groups such as the Pure Land Society and the Chongde Association, launched a campaign to assist disaster relief in North China. They gathered at Jing'an Temple yesterday, with Yuan Ying, Desen, Fan Cheng, Zhenhua, Miga, Wu Qiyao, Hu Songnian, Zhao Puchu, etc. present. They agreed to set a fundraising target of 600,000 yuan. In addition to identifying 200,000 yuan on the spot, they immediately began actively soliciting donations from Buddhist believers.</p>
<p>Dance Hall Charity</p>
<p>A dance hall on Yuqiaoqing Road will donate all of its business income on the evening of the 11th of this month to disaster relief in North China. The manager of the hall, Zhou Yixing, requested that all the dance stars donate their dance fees for the evening as well. Their enthusiasm for donation is still an innovation.

<h3>Red Swastika Society's Refugee Work-Study Center Continues to Accept Thirty-Six People, Developing Horticulture, Teaching Chicken Farming</h3>
<p>Since the World Red Swastika Society established the Refugee Work-Study Center, Mr. Li Sihao, Chairman of the Executive Committee, and Mr. Li Tianzhen, Director of the General Affairs Group, have urged the director of the center, Qi Kang, and all staff to actively carry out training and work-study programs, planning to soon open up horticulture and teach basic chicken farming knowledge so that the refugees can have productive skills in the shortest possible time.

<p>The Economic World - Short Commentaries</p>
<h3>Re-examining the Lessons of the North China Famine</h3>
<p>This column's May 25th article, "The Lessons of the North China Famine," pointed out that the causes of the recent North China famine were scarce rainfall, hoarding by the wealthy, lack of external grain supply, expansion of cotton fields, and the widespread planting of "useless crops." Among the above causes, the last point is the most important. Why do we say this? Scarce rainfall is temporary and man-made; hoarding by the wealthy can be resolved by law; the lack of external grain supply can be remedied by politics; the expansion of cotton fields can still solve the problem of clothing, and North China cotton can still be exchanged for Central China rice; only the widespread planting of "useless crops" is the artificial creation of current and future famines.</p>
<p>Due to several reports from the first joint discussion of all groups of the Shanghai All Circles North China Relief Association the other day, we feel more and more that if we want to relieve the suffering of famine for the people of North China from now on, then changing to planting "beneficial crops" is the only important task at present. So, how to change to planting "beneficial crops"? It is precisely what was guessed in those few reports: (1) Find a way to transport corn seeds to the disaster area for cultivation, (2) The North lacks seeds, find a way to supply them as soon as possible, (3) Encourage the planting of Chinese yams to increase food supply; Corn and yams are not only popular foods, but also foods rich in nutrients, and are the best representatives of the so-called "beneficial crops." The planting of all "useless crops" throughout North China should be replaced with this type of "beneficial crops." This is much more thorough than the "storing grain for disaster prevention" method.</p>
<p>One more supplementary remark: the types of food included in "beneficial crops" are numerous, and are of course not limited to corn and yams; but since they are "beneficial crops," they should be used as much as possible to supply food for the people, and should not be arbitrarily put to wasteful uses. Therefore, Mr. Zhang Yipeng asked to collect wheat and stop making wine to replenish disaster relief grain; Wine was originally not needed for people's food, and the main purpose of buying wheat was to allocate it to flour mills for flour production to meet the needs of the people's food. Therefore, we must not only promote the widespread planting of "beneficial crops," but also oppose the waste of "beneficial crops." These problems, especially the widespread planting of "useless crops," are all lessons we have learned from the North China famine.</p>
<h3>Chairman Tang of the Commercial Control Association Clarifies the Significance of Various Industry Organizations, Hopes That All Elected Directors and Supervisors Will Handle Affairs With Integrity</h3>
<p>Regarding the internal structure of the competent authorities of the National Commercial Control Association, the industry associations of various industry departments, and the Sino-Japanese joint professional committees, people from all walks of life have not been able to deeply understand them. Mr. Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the Association, specially issued a statement to clarify the organizational system and the nature of the various industry associations and professional committees, and the obligations that all elected directors and supervisors should fulfill. The statement said, "Since the Commercial Control Association was reorganized and directly under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, all control work has been handled in accordance with the instructions of the Executive Yuan. All internal organizational systems (1) belong to the internal departments, with four departments and fifteen groups, and the members are all Chinese personnel appointed by the Association; the industry associations of various industry departments are completely composed of Chinese commercial groups (i.e., trade associations); the professional committees are composed of Chinese and Japanese industry merchants because of commercial relations with friendly countries. All industry associations and professional committees must engage in work in accordance with the four words 'fairness, integrity, and clarity.' It is hoped that the directors, supervisors, and committee members of each industry association (and each industry trade association) and each industry professional committee will not regard it as a kind of right. It must be known that this kind of control work, from the Commercial Control Association to the elected chairman, directors, and supervisors of each association and each industry trade association, is of an obligation nature, serving national policies, handling all control work for social service, and should especially adhere to the spirit of 'commercial collective autonomous control,' strictly abide by laws and regulations to promote the control policy. If there is any illegal behavior that violates the control principles, once discovered, it will be ordered to reorganize. The Japanese side's various industry associations also have the same measures. In addition to the direct order from the Commercial Control Association, the Japanese Embassy will be asked to order the reorganization at any time. In short, this kind of control is rigid and practical, with no room for accommodation. If there is any violation of the law, it will be punished according to law. I hope that the persons in charge of each industry association will pay close attention to it. As for the Materials Control Review Committee established by the National Government, it is composed of officials from the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the chairman of the Commercial Control Association as committee members, and is a material control review agency. The Commercial Control Association is an approval agency directly under the Executive Yuan," he said.</p>
<h3>Municipal Price Evaluation Council Held Its First Inaugural Meeting Yesterday, Resolving Four Important Cases</h3>
<p>In order to effectively promote central laws and regulations and actively adjust prices in the city, the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau, in accordance with the regulations, restored the municipal price evaluation committee.

Mr. Wang Zhigang, Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, personally attended and delivered an opening speech. Chairman Lin reported on the situation of suppressing prices before the establishment of the Committee and the process of preparing to establish the Evaluation Council. Then, four important cases were discussed and resolved: (1) The prices of various commodities in the city have not been approved by the Economic Bureau in the past, or have not been evaluated and determined by the Committee recently, and shall not be evaluated and implemented by the trade associations without authorization. It is proposed to sign and request the Economic Bureau to telegraph the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify the trade associations to comply with the request for approval, which was resolved and passed. (2) The trade associations of various industries in the city should list in detail the cost calculation tables of various commodities in the industry as of April 30, together with the supporting documents, and send them to the Committee for evaluation. It is proposed to sign and request the Economic Bureau to notify them to comply with the request for approval, which was resolved and passed. (3) In accordance with the provisions of central laws and regulations, the trade associations of various industries in the city shall be responsible for supervising the member firms of the industry and shall not wholesale various commodities to non-members to prevent hoarding. It is proposed to sign and request the Economic Bureau to notify them to comply with the request for approval, which was resolved and passed. (4) The prices of rice and various grains in the city are proposed to be approved by the Food Bureau in accordance with the law. The request for approval was resolved and passed.</p>
<h3>Visits to Various Ports to Prepare for the Establishment of Rural Pawnshops</h3>
<p>In order to revitalize the rural economy, the Ministry of Industry ordered the establishment of rural pawnshops in various places in accordance with the "Provisional Rules for Rural Pawnshops." Rural pawnshops are aimed at farmers and operate on the pawned items. (1) Rural public pawnshops are those operated by administrative authorities, local autonomous organizations, or public groups. Rural pawnshops jointly operated by officials and the public also belong to this category. (2) Rural commercial pawnshops are those purely funded by merchants. All privately-run rural pawnshops with sole proprietorship, partnership, or company organizations belong to this category. Rural pawnshops mainly accept the following items as pawned items, and may also accept various deposits: (1) Clothing and bedding, (2) Gold and silver ornaments, (3) Rural handicrafts, (4) Agricultural products, (5) Furniture and agricultural tools, (6) Other items that are easy to store. However, in the following circumstances, the pawn should be refused immediately: (1) When there is a suspicion of obviously involving criminal stolen goods, (2) When the value is too high or difficult to estimate, (3) When violating the prohibition order, (4) When it is too bulky or most easily perishable and not suitable for storage. The total capital of each rural pawnshop must be more than 30,000 yuan of public funds, and it may request the central or local government to allocate public houses for the pawnshop to use, without collecting rent or allocating public funds to deposit in the pawnshop, reducing interest, and subsidizing part or all of its operating expenses and house repair and reconstruction expenses, reducing or exempting all taxes and levies on business and income and pawned items, and the interest on the pawn shall not exceed one and six thousandths of the monthly interest, and the storage fee shall not exceed one and four thousandths of the monthly interest, and the full pawn period shall not be less than nine months. Those who establish rural pawnshops shall register with the competent authority in accordance with the law and obtain approval before operating.</p>

<h3>The Honest Mirror</h3>
<p>— Cheng Jusun</p>
<p>Is it taboo to say "people do not know their own appearance"? As long as you face a mirror - just look - isn't it clear at a glance!</p>
<p>But never be saddened by seeing your own ugly face in the mirror. And don't be proud of your own beauty! Because the mirror is dishonest; it can only show you your external form and appearance -- a well-dressed body, but it cannot reveal the "real" you -- your personality.</p>
<p>Since the mirror only allows us to see the ugliness and beauty of our appearance, then what kind of mirror should we use to see our personality? Of course, we need an "honest mirror," which is "conscience self-examination." Only "conscience" can know one's own personality, and only "self-examination" can know all one's mistakes. Zeng Zi said: "I examine myself three times a day." Even the sages and wise men were like this, let alone we young people who have entered the world to seek deep knowledge.</p>
<p>People often do not realize whether what they are doing is "right" or "wrong" at the time when they are doing something. If they do not add "self-examination" afterwards, then their mistakes will never be corrected. There is also a kind of person who knows that things should not be done this way, but still stubbornly does them. This is also a wrong idea caused by the youth's exuberance... Some people lose their personality because of these mistakes.</p>
<p>Friends, use your "honest mirror" to look at yourself! And take a closer look, carefully observe your past mistakes, and correct your stubborn views, and you will become a good, real "person"!</p>
<p>Finally, I still want to tell you tirelessly: "Don't spend a lot of time in front of the mirror on the dressing table, you should try to use your free time to look into your 'honest mirror' -- conscience self-examination."</p>
<h3>Student Voices: The Distress of High School Graduates</h3>
<p>— Ji Weiyi</p>
<p>Dear Friend: Haven't you received any news from me for a long time! I'm telling you, it's not that I'm too busy preparing for exams and ignoring your inquiries, but the distress of graduation makes me feel like I'm lost in a fog. Now I want to pour it all out to you, so I can thoroughly cleanse my recklessly thinking brain.</p>
<p>Graduating from high school, this should be something to be envied. But, who can understand the anxiety in their hearts? The reason for this anxiety is nothing more than the environment that has created it, no wonder the predecessors sighed: "Graduation is the beginning of decline."</p>
<p>After graduation, there are only two paths: further education and employment.</p>
<p>Those from families who can afford it and want to study have no problem. However, we happen to be part of those who do not inherit property, are not good at managing affairs, but still want to continue studying. It is expected that there will be many applicants for schools with low tuition fees and can obtain real knowledge and skills. And whether or not they will be accepted is a chilling question. Otherwise, if you can't get in, even though there are many schools like clouds and the sea, the considerable tuition fee is very difficult to obtain. And with so much money spent, can you buy the best quality goods (as it really is)? This is a "major" question.</p>
<p>Therefore, many classmates resolutely decide not to study further and simply take up employment, using the quick knife to cut the tangled hemp and throw the road to education out of their minds. But, they also have distress. They also have difficulties. Where does this begin?</p>
<p>Originally, this is a society that values qualifications. High school graduates are not as knowledgeable as the general older generations and university students (although some university students are just outwardly impressive). In terms of experience, they are far inferior to clerks who have learned from apprenticeship training. Furthermore, "a newborn calf is not afraid of a tiger," high school graduates are not as easy to order around as older employees; but their airs (?) are not at all lacking. Because society seems to only need people who look up to the future, and those who are humble and subservient to be exploited. Therefore, high school graduates are generally unwelcome. Moreover, this is a time of expensive rice and cinnamon firewood, and everywhere is requesting austerity.</p>
<p>Therefore, getting a job is not a very easy thing. We can only blame this on this cursed society.</p>
<p>We can clearly see the contradiction in this society: those who want to study do not have the strength to bear the high tuition fees, while those who have money do not want to study. People who work hard to earn a living cannot find a job that can only maintain their lives, while those who do not worry about food and clothing occupy high positions and try to amass wealth.</p>
<p>Do you want to say that I am complaining? Anyway, this is the truth after all!</p>
<p>Think about it, living in this era, how can high school graduates not be distressed?</p>
<h3>For Myself and For Others</h3>
<p>— Zhang</p>
<p>Yang Zhu advocated: "I would not pluck out a hair to benefit the world." Mozi advocated: "Weary of skin and bone to benefit the world." Two sages, doing things, and having such different principles, truly making it difficult for people to follow. But after careful thought, in order to "for myself," I must "for others," "for others" is also "for myself." "For myself" and "for others", these two are said to be contradictory, but at the same time, they are in a position of cooperation. In order to carry out the mission of our lives, neither can be abandoned.</p>
<p>The so-called "for myself" is not necessarily a selfish and self-interested life proposition - only that advocated by Mr. Yang Zhu, who only cares about his own moral cultivation, is selfish and self-interested - to explain the meaning of the two words "for myself" in modern language, is the right to personal survival. However, in order to achieve the purpose of personal survival, it is necessary to jointly build a good society with the spirit of "for others". Because people are social animals, and if they are separated, they will become incompetent and unable to survive. Because of this, he is a private person on the one hand, and a member of society on the other hand, and with these dual relationships, he must "for myself" on the one hand, and "for others" on the other.</p>
<p>Yang Zhu only saw one aspect of doing things. He did not know that society is the cradle of human survival and happiness, and it does not originally have any purpose. It is just an organization for millions of people to live together in worry. If he were to despise the society on which his survival depends and refuse to cooperate with society, then not only would he not be able to keep the hair he was unwilling to give up, but even his own life would have nowhere to rest. Therefore, we must learn from Mozi to work hard and then hope to build an ideal society where we can ask for and take what we need. In the process of practicing "for others", we have also fulfilled the task of "for myself".</p>
<p>However, the "for myself" like Yang Zhu's is just a passive attitude of doing things. Compared with those who not only do not pluck a hair but also scrape people's skin, it is still seen as more ignorant, less cunning, and less harmful! But then again, no matter how many advantages these people take and how much unjust wealth they make, the social mechanism repeatedly loses its fair operation, and as a result, stability and order cannot be maintained. The misfortune of society is also a barrier to the happiness of individuals. People who truly know how to pursue personal happiness all know that this kind of thing is like playing with fire and is not taken by the wise!</p>
<h3>Talking About Popular Literature</h3>
<p>— Dongfang</p>
<p>Among the departments of literature, general popular literature has a wider readership than any other kind of literature. Because literature is inherently for the masses, and popular literature is for the masses.</p>
<p>The beginning of popular literature is the British writer Dickens. This does not mean that there was no popular literature before his works, but that his works can be said to have opened a new era for popular literature. In his works, such as "A Tale of Two Cities," "Hard Times," etc., the life of the lower classes is the object of his writing, and there is a very large reaction and a spicy satire of the upper class in the transition period at that time. His works lack psychological description, but contain a lot of humor. He often uses behavior and action to replace cumbersome psychological descriptions. These are loved by the general middle and lower classes.</p>
<p>The greatest value of popular literature is to raise the level of the general readers. Therefore, it holds a kind of repulsive power, and it does not lower the level to cater to the masses, but is the advocate and defender of the "general masses' inferior and backward emotions"; "it does not selectively cater to the psychology of the general public and beautify and decorate the backward, submissive, and lowly emotions of the general public.</p>
<p>The subject matter of popular literature does not have to be limited to the circles of the middle and lower social classes. All kinds of great life and the various aspects of the upper class can be used as themes. It is narrated in an easy-to-understand tone and is suitable for the tastes of the general public. Of course, the best work is a true record of the writer's life experience. Therefore, I hope that writers will put themselves into real life, enrich the themes of their works, adopt these experiential themes, and use an easy-to-understand tone and a writing style suitable for the tastes of the masses to create exquisite works. These works will surely be accepted by the broad masses of the people and become the literature of the masses.</p>
<p>What we need now is a kind of popular literature that can improve the cultural level of the masses. In terms of theme, it should be positive and helpful to the growth of the new society and must fully overcome works that only have entertainment value and are too empty and unrealistic.</p>
<h3>"Optimism" · "Escaping Reality"</h3>
<p>— Wenzhong</p>
<p>Under the pressure of extreme distress, most people's psychology has lost its normal state: some people linger in the city of sorrow all day long, complaining about heaven and blaming others, and even do not hesitate to use their own hands to destroy their own lives; others who call themselves "optimists" hold a large pile of "taking it easy", "doing one day as a monk and striking the bell one day", "today there is wine, today I am drunk" and other "romantic philosophies". It's a pity that they lack the courage to "see through the red dust" and then "shave their heads to become monks"!</p>
<p>These people think that fighting with the environment is in vain: and suicide is even more unnecessary, in fact, they simply do not want to die, thinking that life in the world is only once, and happiness should be enjoyed in time; why wait for the future? Therefore, those with a few banknotes in their pockets spend their days in places of sensuality and indulgence, living a life of drunken dreams, thinking they are carefree in the world. They despise the heavens. As for those who have no connection with "Brother Copper Coin," they also have fun in poverty, trying to live a quiet life in a noisy environment. Therefore, they lock themselves in a small room to hum and scribble, express their complaints, or wander on the streets. When bored, they invite a few like-minded "friends" to sit in a teahouse for a few hours, sipping tea while commenting on the women walking on the road, or each freely discussing "life views" and gossiping about "strange news and sights."</p>
<p>The above-mentioned characters can be said to be very "optimistic". They sincerely believe that the universe is so great and they are so small, what are the students busy with? Why bother to worry? It's better to abandon all the beautiful dreams of success and enter their own paradise to spend their lives!</p>
<p>In fact, this kind of thinking is not qualified to be called "optimism"? It is just a kind of "escaping reality" fantasy. These people are indeed conquered by the environment and become victims of the environment.</p>
<p>Those who are not bound by the environment and are not moved by happiness, anger, sorrow, and joy can be called "optimistic". It is very obvious that "optimism" is to overcome the environment, while "escaping reality" is precisely to be conquered by the environment. The two are absolutely in opposite positions.</p>
<p>We are in this turbulent society, and the responsibilities we bear are so great? The reality absolutely does not allow us to shirk the responsibility on our shoulders and escape to the Peach Blossom Garden to enjoy ourselves. The life of a hermit is not suitable for us at all. In short, the environment is indeed bad, but we must not use a negative attitude to escape reality. We believe that the future is bright as long as we have an "optimistic" way of thinking: hold on to the present and actively fight against the bad environment!</p>
<h3>Teacher and Tea Server</h3>
<p>— Shengyao</p>
<p>I have a relative who is a middle school teacher. He teaches Chinese in high school and is paid 7 yuan and 25 cents per hour. He teaches for a full six hours a day, earning 43 yuan and 50 cents.</p>
<p>The son of the old nanny in my house is a tea server in a certain company. Today, a wealthy elder is marrying off his daughter, and the company, big and small, public and private, all came to send 1,200 yuan in legal tender. The tea server received a tip of 120 yuan. Tomorrow, a certain bank will open, and he will send a silver something, earning 50 yuan for his effort.</p>
<p>A teacher has extra energy and can teach three or four hours a day, which is already amazing. Weddings and funerals, happy events, and auspicious openings follow one after another, and there are always ten or so times a month.</p>
<p>The responsibility of a teacher is to enlighten the people and cultivate the pillars of the country; the tea server is to listen to calls and be summoned, working hard for a living.</p>
<p>The teacher at least writes books and speaks fluently. He can talk about the past and the present; most of the tea servers are illiterate.</p>
<p>Although the teacher does not wear a suit, he must wear a long gown; people call him "Sir"; the tea server can wear short clothes and a small jacket, and others see him as a member of the "short-shirt gang".</p>
<p>But the teacher's remuneration is like this, and the tea server's remuneration is like this.</p>
<p>The tea server receives the extra benefits of the capitalists and already lives very well; but how many capitalists want to add benefits to the teachers who educate their children?</p>
<p>People who are content with their own lives are all complaining about the difficulty of life, but why?</p>
<p>"I do not worry about scarcity, but worry about inequality!"</p>
<h3>Qi (Vital Energy/Anger)</h3>
<p>— Defang</p>
<p>How great is "Qi"! Once a person becomes prominent and powerful, he can intimidate his subordinates with "Qi", ordering them around, what a prestige? What about those below? Although they are innocently humiliated, they have to lower their voices, swallow their anger, and dare not refute or argue. Otherwise, their rice bowl may be broken. So, the big cow suppresses his anger in his chest, or goes home to "be naughty", venting his anger on his wife and children. Is this what is meant by one crab eating another?</p>
<p>However, there are also people who simply cannot stand other people's criticism and ridicule. As the saying goes, "fight for honor, not for wealth", they would rather lose money than let others gain the upper hand in words. This is the so-called face-saving faction.</p>
<p>Young people are often criticized as "young and vigorous". The tone is one of blame, meaning that they cannot endure. Indeed, young people all have a courage, and their hearts cannot tolerate unpleasant things! In anger, they can abandon everything and travel far away. Of course, this kind of stimulating "Qi" can also really do great things, but if they blindly act based on a temporary "Qi" and make a desperate gamble, then this "Qi" will not be able to withstand one or two blows and setbacks and will "run out of Qi".</p>
<p>The ancients mostly talked about the method of "cultivating Qi", cultivating our magnificent Qi. The so-called Prime Minister's belly can hold a boat, which means that a person should have a broad mind, be able to tolerate criticisms. To be able to tolerate is to be able to endure. Endurance is not numbness. It has feelings, reflection, examination, and labor. Do not let emotional "Qi" blind the clear-minded intellect. To be rushed and frustrated and make groundless counterattacks, success is only venting one's own anger, failure will cause prejudice, deviating from the greater self and embarking on the wrong path, and treating temper tantrums as the guide for doing things.</p>
<h3>Three Realizations</h3>
<p>— Renchuan</p>
<p>In the past, I often suffered from a kind of "indecision and hesitation", which is a fatal injury to "nothing accomplished". Neither donkey nor horse, neither fish nor fowl, finally being looked down upon as "unlearned and unskilled". This is the first point that should be painfully realized.</p>
<p>In dealing with people, one should be kind and amiable; in establishing oneself in the world, one must be honest and self-disciplined. Young people are shallow in knowledge and impatient, "eyes higher than the top of the head, mouth as big as a basket", spouting nonsense, acting as if they are invincible, which will inevitably lead to isolation and failure. This is the second point that should be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Aspiration is the goal of action. Without aspiration is like a "blind man riding a blind horse", jumping around randomly, but still trapped in confusion in the end? Therefore, setting an aspiration is the most important thing. Without setting an aspiration, the footing is unstable, the mind is dizzy, there is no distinction between right and wrong, and one cannot distinguish between the treacherous and the evil. Like floating flowers in the flowing water, one does not know where to return! Isn't such a life dangerous! This is the third point that should be deeply realized.</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>Fudan University Responds to the North China Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>Fudan University students held a general meeting to respond to the North China disaster relief. It was decided to launch a fundraising campaign with a predetermined goal of 50,000 yuan, with a deadline of February 28. More than 10,000 yuan have been raised. After the fundraising is completed, it will be sent to the Finance Department of the Emergency Relief Association. The school also hopes that the whole city</p>
<h3>Chao-Shan Disaster Relief Donations</h3>
<p>After the famine occurred in Chao-Shan and other places, readers sent letters calling for help. The Shui Office yesterday collected donations from all walks of life to help the disaster victims in Chao-Shan. The list includes: Li Huaisheng and Xiao Di each donated 50 yuan, Wang Zhenhua donated 40 yuan, Huang Shenfu Hall donated 400 yuan, and the colleagues of Xu Meifu General Office jointly donated 300 yuan, which fully shows the righteousness and courage of the Chao-Shan natives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Wannian Cemetery Should Be Built Quickly with Bamboo Fences</h3>
<p>— Bai Xia</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to Wannian Cemetery in Caohejing to sweep the tombs and saw that the north and four sides were all cut off. The cemetery has become a shortcut to Caohejing Town. Since people are trespassing, they will inevitably step on the tombs, and the gravediggers can do nothing about it. It is said that Wannian Cemetery was originally run by Huang Chu Jiu. After his great change, it was hosted by his concubine. She is very familiar with the situation of the cemetery. I hope that the grave owners can find a way to contact each other and elect a person in charge to help Mrs. Huang deal with it. The north and west sides must at least be surrounded by bamboo fences, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve the purpose of safekeeping. As for the cost, it can be divided equally by the grave owners, and the Huang family cannot be completely blamed for undertaking this arduous task.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Buddhist Congee Kitchen</h3>
<p>The Nanshi Buddhist Congee Kitchen was established in August 1942. As of the end of April 1943, it has distributed food to 650,054 destitute people (each serving is for about two people, so there are actually one million people), with a total expenditure of 376,605 yuan and 45 cents for food, fuel, office expenses, etc. The income from donations and sideline profits is 321,818 yuan and 90 cents. The overdraft is 54,781 yuan and 55 cents. The current stock in the warehouse can only last until the end of May. It is found that there are four congee kitchens in Nanshi, and three of them have been closed one after another. The remaining one is the Buddhist Congee Kitchen. At present, the consumption required is about 50,000 yuan per month. Recently, the directors ordered that the target of congee distribution should be the poor and disabled who are over five years old and under fifty years old. They also hope that all circles will donate. Receipts will be sent to the Trust Department of Jincheng Bank on Jiangxi Road, Shen Bao on Hankou Road, Xinwen Bao on Sichuan Road, Qian Qin Bank on Tianjin Road, and the Buddhist Congee Kitchen in Guandi Lane, Lao Ximen, Nanshi (telephone number 011070667).</p>
<h3>Art Academy Discusses Scholarship Quota</h3>
<p>The New China Art Academy at 270 Chengdu Road was founded by Tan Zhengjian, Lu Si, Liu Rukui, Yang Yinshi, and Yang Hewenyi. It has two departments: film and theater and literature. It has now begun to register students. Mr. Zhang Mingqiu, who is enthusiastic about art education, generously donated five scholarships to poor students in the Literature Department of the academy. All young people who are determined to enter the academy but are really unable to afford it can apply to participate in the examination. Those who are admitted will be exempted from all tuition fees. Actors are also being recruited to train new actors at the academy.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment: Qianzhuang Pu Jiting, a kind gentleman from Zi Suo, delivered one hundred bottles of salt-made epidemic prevention water donated by Mr. Renai, instructing us to distribute them to poor teachers. We hereby acknowledge this.</p>
<p>Lost and Found: This morning, someone found a bunch of keys at the entrance of this building. The owner is asked to claim them at this office.</p>
