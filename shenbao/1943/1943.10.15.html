<h3 id="c1">整頓上海國民敎育的商榷 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自來國家的盛衰，政治的隆替，全　於人才之消長。人才非培養不可得，培養的方法端在敎育。故中外古今各國之欲其國運興隆者，莫不重視敎育，而尤其重視國民敎育。蓋以國民敎育為一切敎育之母。十九世紀以來，世界先進各國先後頒佈義務敎育法令，規定兒童强迫就學年齡，並改善小學敎師待遇，使之視為終身事業。凡此種種：均為重視國民敎育之特徵。故能敎育普及，人才輩出，國家昌盛。吾國對於敎育一端，向不重視，敎育經　佔國家及地方之歲出極微，且每値政府財政拮据之際，動輙停發，或减發敎育經費，抵發其他軍政開支之不足。以致報紙所載案薪罷敎之舉，屢見不鮮。平時即幸能按期發放，然敎師待遇大都異常菲薄，不足以資事畜，故聰明才智之士，除自抱犧牲之宏願者外，多薄敎育事業而不為。以如此之敎育情形，而欲達到培養人才之目的，豈可得乎？豈可得乎？</p>
<p>因爲公家經費支絀，公立學校不能普及，於是私立學校便應運而生。其中固不乏以作育人才爲職志者，但大多數則純屬商業性質。校舍空氣光綫之是否適合衛生標準？敎師學　經騐之能否勝任愉快？均非所問。其唯一目的，端在多收學費，少耗開支，以飽私囊。至如招生方法，則競異炫奇，以廣吿傳單招貼為吸引之工具。以致盲於選擇之家長，鮮不墜入彀中。父兄金錢之損失尙屬有限，兒童光陰之虛擲則巳悔無可追。故有心人皆謚此種學校爲「學店」，主張應予事業有成取締，以免貽誤學童，良非過甚之舉　　近年以來，百物昂貴，度日維艱，固無人不受生活之壓迫。然而生活之艱苦，當無過於小學敎師者。學生家長之負担雖日盛加重，但小學敎師之待遇初未見比例的改善。我們不斷聽見小學敎師的呼籲，不是說「三餐不得一飽，拿什麽精神去敎書」；便是說「終年替人家敎育子女，弄到本身子女却窮得沒有受敎育的機會。」在這種情形之下，希望小學敎師安心服務，是絕對不可能的。從小我言，為我們子女的學業；從大我言，為整個民族的前途，我們都應該大聲疾呼，以有效的方法，消弭這種不良現象。何况同時還有許多學童，因為學費不勝負担，隨時都有失學之厄，我們對於消弭這種現象，實感不能再緩須臾。以近年社會人士熱烈贊助助學金以及館穀助金的情形言，大家對於國民敎育與國家前途的關係是有認識的，對於小學敎師的處境也是同情的。我們現在更進一步，希望上海的國民敎育能根本改善，相信社會人士也必予以同樣的同情和贊助。</p>
<p>我們並非說上海的大中學敎育情形可以滿意，不過覺得整頓國民敎育尤為當務之急，所以主張整頓上海敎育，應該先從整頓上海之國民敎育入手。</p>
<p>以世界各國情形　，接受國民强迫敎育，是人民的義務，也是權利，所以各國國民學校均由國家設立，例不收費。我國財政狀况以及國民納稅負担，遠非各國可比，因此公立學校酌收學費，並允許私立學校之設置，以補公立之不足，事　上本屬無可　議。不過對於私立學校管理方面，旣有法規可　遵循，　應依法　格執行，勿使徒成具文。而今日竟有如斯不良現象發生，誠不能說不是主管敎育機關的失察。我們現在特將小學法小學規程中有關學校收費及敎員資格各點摘述如後，　供主管敎育機關的檢討，和熱心敎育問題者的硏究：</p>
<p>小學法第十六條規定私立小學學費每人每學期初級至三圓，高級至多不得逾六圓。</p>
<p>修正小學規程第五十七條，規定除有特別情形呈經主管敎育機關特別核准，得向較殷實之兒童家族募集圖書建築臨時捐外，不得向兒童徵收任何費用。</p>
<p>修正小學規程第五十六條，規定小學必需學用品，得由學校發給，或組織消費合作社以極低廉價格售諸兒童。</p>
<p>修正小學規程第六十二條，規定小學級任及專乎敎師之資格。第六十三條，規定凡無上條所規定之資格者，應受檢定。第六十七條，規定合格敎員聲請主管敎育機關予以登記。第六十八條，規定小學聘請敎員，應以登記公佈者為限。</p>
<p>觀於上列各條，足見法律規定已極完備，患在未能執行。以上海情形言，過去租界未接收，政令不統一，發生此種現象尙不足怪。但現在一八兩區公署巳同時成立，以中國人辦中國事，尤其是一件與國家民族極關重要的事，似乎不容再行漠視。何况一八兩區財政狀况相當良好，事實上增加一點敎育經費支出，尙非絕不可能。關於整頓工作，我們所要建議的僅有下列五點：</p>
<p>要求一八兩區公署多設公立完全小學，按照規定資格，愼選師資，並特別減低學費及多設免費學額，用作模範，並以嘉惠淸寒。</p>
<p>舉辦私立小學登記，嚴格審查各校收支狀况，並公開徵求各校學生家長及敎員合作，報吿收費及待遇情形，然後參酌一般開支情形，及普通家族負担能力，　定劃一收費標準。（並絕對禁止巧立名目徵收任何費用）所有不足經費，由市政機關在市政經費項下或公開徵募敎育捐款分別補助之。</p>
<p>舉辦小學敎員登記，（凡無小學規程第六十二條所規定之敎員資格者，應於檢定後再准登記。）並規定嗣後各校延聘敎員，應以登記公佈者為限。在過渡期內，得允許現任敎員繼續服務，惟檢定不合格者，應由主管敎育機關設立小學敎員　成所，責令入所受訓，經過若干時期後，重予測騐檢定。倘仍不合格，即應毅然停止職務，以重學童學業。</p>
<p>改善小學敎員待遇，規定最低俸給標準，並創設小學敎師消費合作社，舉辦小學敎師疾病保險，及訂立小學敎師子女入學特別優待辦法，或給予補助金，俾可安心服務。</p>
<p>成立學童消費合作社，以最低價格供給學用品，絕對禁止學校强迫掗　，從中漁利。</p>
<p>語云：「一年之計權　，十年之計樹木，百年之計樹人。」吾國人才缺乏，今日已達極點。其病根即平日不重視敎育，培養人才，以致臨渴掘井，時興才難之歡。失今不圖，噬臍更將莫及，而培養人才，應自健全國民敎育始。上海財物富庶，敎育經費易於籌集，文化較高，優良師資易於羅致，所以我們很希望以上海健全國民敎育的起點，進而推及全國。</p>

<p>馬尼剌十四日中央社電　菲律賓共和國十四日在洛勒爾大總統領導下，正式樹立，是日上午八時，日政府於菲島建國大典舉行前，以菲島方面　軍最高指揮官名義聲明撤　軍政，九時四十分於國會議事堂前之式塲，嚴肅舉行菲律　共和國大總統就任典禮，菲律賓方面要人，日本方面村田特命全權大使，菲島方面陸海軍最高指揮官有末（陸軍），矢野（海軍）兩代表，　贊會各代表等均出席。式塲前廣塲中，民衆蜂擁而至，實達三十萬人之多，首由伐爾加斯行政長官起立，發表大日本帝國已將軍政撤廢，並代表全菲民衆　日本之好意表示感謝，繼由獨立準備委員會委員長洛勒爾於萬民歡呼聲中，以强力之語調，朗體獨立宣言，對中外宣告獨立，　菲律賓為　　於創造和平自由及　義之世界秩序，於茲樹立菲律賓共和國。九時五十分由阿基那爾　將軍升旗，同時吹奏菲律賓國歌，全塲充滿慶賀肌國建國之歡騰空氣，首都馬尼剌市及全菲島寺院與此呼應，一致鳴鐘，祝福菲島完成獨立。十時五分，由伐爾加斯行政長官發表選舉大總統之結果，十時十分，洛勒爾於發砲聲中宣言就任非律賓共和國第一任大總統，全體起立致敬，洛勒爾繼發表演說，披瀝其熱烈決意與信念。嗣黑田菲島方面陸軍最高指揮官起立朗讀祝詞，代表日政府對菲律賓共和國表示祝意，最後由非島官民及在菲軸心國人約萬餘人於式塲前舉行祝賀分列式，迄正午始行閉幕。菲島民衆多年宿望，於茲實現，東亞共榮圈中又增加有力之一員，東亞之解放與全東亞之團結情勢，將益形堅固。</p>
<h3 id="c3">洛勒爾氏宣布　共和國使命　並具體說明建國宏圖 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>馬尼剌十四日中央社電　洛勒爾氏十四日上午十時十五分就任大總統後，當即發表演說，首行說明菲律賓之建國意義及菲律賓共和國之使命，復就其建設新非律賓國之宏圖，予以具體說明，茲　其演　要旨如次：</p>
<p>今天乃我菲律賓民族鬥爭數世紀而終得達成吾人之</p>
<p>崇高理想</p>
<p>之日，吾人之解救？乃由此世界大混　中而獲得。吾人對於使我民族得償夙願之大日本帝國天皇陛下之聖德，立將吾人之眞　　忱，昭示於世界，列席於此之大日本帝國以及其他地方之嘉賓，即為東洋民族間傳統的友好關係及相互理解之證據，於此種過去及現在，對菲島民衆寄以信賴之大日本帝國陸海軍最高指揮官閣下，表示甚深之感謝。吾菲律賓今巳成一自由獨立之國家，故吾人之當前急務，即為維持領土內之和平秩序，今後萬一有不逞之徒妨害　人之重　計劃，威脅共和國之存在時，則吾人即視其為吾民衆之公敵，並採取適當措置，以處置之。前聯邦政府之平時，菲律賓尙須由外地輸入米與其他食糧，今因受　爭影響，食糧之不足，巳現愈深刻，然此並非困雖問題，蓋因吾人肥沃土地之出產，可供全人口需要物　之三倍，吾人為與共榮圈各地交換物資與共榮圈各國實行經濟合作，將重行調整國內</p>
<p>經濟機構</p>
<p>俾能克盡共榮之責任。吾人為復興國家經濟，將採用健全而穩定之通貨制度，保證資本得以健全流通，振興新工業，改良交通設備，改善道路港灣　備及積，造船又為適　戰時經濟，實行必需物品之　給制度，尙必須設立統制物價之機關，蓋因雖已獲得政治上之自由，而倘無圓滑之經濟，仍將成為有名無實也。俟國家經濟自給　勢確立務，須　及貧困者之福祉，講求各種救濟方策，社會各階層間之經濟，若不均衡，則無全民衆之福祉，幸我國有充分之耕地，此可謂為我國經濟資源之根幹，須將此土地分給大衆，予以物資援助，俾求安定經濟。凡我國民須負起新責任，以改變道德良心，且吾人須訓練為團獻身之國民，我國憲法保障為滿足</p>
<p>個人幸福　　所需要最大限度之自由，然新國民須認識應盡義務，具有犧牲自巳權利，達成應盡義務之精神，對義務之忠誠，首應由軍人官史垂範國民，我國敎育制度，須以東洋精神刷新之，家庭及社會之基礎，加强家長權威，復指婦人本來地位，方為使菲人家族制度向上穩固之要素，政府決獎勵國語學校及國文學校，或以公一文及一般儀式，力謀普及發達，答加爾語又增加出生率，亦為我國所最希望者。以上所述。即余在我共和國創立之始於政治方面之方針，此廣範重要之事業，斷非短短時期內可期完成者，今我國境之彼方，仍繼續熾烈戰鬥。又吾人須牢記，我國資源多尙未開發，吾人於經濟力許可範圍內，至少須急速完成遠大計劃之第一階段，為謀民衆之</p>
<p>安居樂業</p>
<p>須完成政府機構，使之單純化，以期經營一切效果，吾人須剷除派別鬥爭，余在担任國家全責任之階段中，決不參與任何政黨，僅為我唯一之共和國，吾人應僅有一黨，即人民之政黨，余認國放憲法國歌及大總統即人民團結之中心。國旗象徵我國勇士精神，代表領土主權，國歌則為我民族希望之業務，故可謂為我等之中心，大總統乃人民之指導者，率領之根幹，亦即國家之中心，此四點可喚起全非民衆之精神與熱情，相信我國民將一致團結　攻擊水平綫彼方之挑戰行為　我等勿再恐怖　　，　以堅定信念，　往直前。我等將舉　　全力獻身</p>
<p>於此空前偉業，我等綜合各個人之一滴努力，可成共同努力之溝渠，如激流急湍，怒　澎湃，將使任何障碍物化為無力，如此我等唯一之目的與共同之決意，方能確立眞正永久不朽之獨立。</p>
<h3 id="c4">菲島建國大典中黑田指揮官祝詞 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>馬尼刺十四日中央社電　菲律賓共和國建國大典中，日黑田菲島方面　軍指揮官祝辭如次：菲律賓之獨立，乃菲島民衆多年夙願，不知有幾多先烈為此光榮犧牲，今日欣逢獨立盛典，全菲島民衆固同聲慶視，卽長眠地下之先烈，亦當衷心欣慰也。先烈當年愛國之熱血，仍充沛於菲島民衆之體中，余深信此種國家之前途必充滿光明。日前緬甸之建國，今日菲律賓共和國之誕生，此皆。本道義精神之表現，興亞大業日趨進展，日本之欣喜實無以復加。菲律賓雖不幸因美國之陰險政策，陷　戰爭中，在人物雙方復會受不少打擊，但菲島民衆，終於獲得獨立之榮譽，故余愈深信菲島民衆可由自己手中確立各種體制，完成獨立國家，而為大東亞共榮團之堅强一環。常茲大東亞戰爭愈益熾烈之際，日本有斷然完成作戰之準備與自信，菲島之獨立與繁榮，當由日本之勝利完仝保障，日本不惜　　協力，願全菲島人民堅決信賴日本，向完成重任之途勇往邁進。</p>
<p>向全國民衆廣播演說</p>
<p>馬尼剌十四日中央社電　菲律賓共和國總統洛勒爾，十四日下午七時三十分，在此間官邸向全菲律賓民衆廣播演說，其意謂：吾國之獨立，乃自四百餘年前麥哲倫在吾國登陸以來，即為吾人之願望，菲律實成為美國領土，已有四十餘年，其間吾人曾盡一　努力爭取獨立，獨立法案雖經美國國會通過，但迄朱實現。迨一九四一年十二月二日，大東亞戰爭勃發，日軍在菲島登陸以後，即允許吾國獨立，良以日軍此次作戰，並非與菲人民而戰，其目的在解放東亞各民族，今日本諾言已行實踐，吾人巳宣告獨立，成立菲律賓共和政府，菲律賓共和國總統對菲律賓今得劃入世界三權國家中深為欣　，猶憶此次戰事發生之初，吾人因盲信美國將允許吾人自由，故曾為美國忍受莫大犧牲，然美國終未放棄壓迫政策，及日軍在菲島登陸後，即允許吾人獨立，　吾人過去對日本之悮解完全解除，美國常　稱愛護菲律賓，　吾人今日　　美國承認並尊重菲律賓之獨立，不再　菲律賓人重遭　禍，換言之即余與全菲律賓人民要求美國實踐過去諾言，不妨害菲律賓共和國之前途，　吾人自由建設吾人之國家，余於茲宣布，新生菲律賓共和國，決根據國際公法，尊重各國在菲之利益，並願對建設立足於和平自由道義之世界新秩序有所貢獻。</p>
<p>菲島答加爾語定為公用語</p>
<p>馬尼剌十四日中央社電　菲島因多數不同之種族分居於各地，分別使用各種不同之語言，故無國語之可言，因此熱望獨立之菲島政府於實現完全獨立之前，即早巳着手準備統一國語工作。按菲島現在使用之語言，計有英語，西班牙語等八十七種，西班牙佔領菲島時，曾努力普及西班牙語，及美國領有菲島，乃使用英語，故都市地帶及平原地方多通英語及西班牙語，然大部居民仍使用其種族原有之語言，結果無一種語言可通行菲島全境者。今日於菲島流行範圍最廣之語言，為彼賽亞語及答加　語，彼賽亞人及答加爾人較為菲島最開化之種族，彼賽亞人總數約達七百萬，佔菲島人口之首，仔菲島政治中心人物，則多為答加爾人，故最近菲島決定答加爾語為菲島之公用語，藉以統一國語。此後菲島因言語之統一，其對國民精神之團結上，必愈昻揚。</p>

<p>南京十四日中央社電　近日駐渝美空軍，曾作加强空中攻勞之狂語，但實際其組織能力頗為脆弱，而飛行技術亦極低劣。日昨有來自福建之旅客談稱，本月九日四時，渠目擊汕頭東方四十公里處，有駐渝美機數架來襲。用機槍掃射附近海面燈塔，另有三架，因駕駛者技術欠佳，不　飛近陸地，盤旋燈塔左右，不久機翼與燈塔相碰，機體着火自焚，被迫降落沙灘，駕駛員均與機同歸於盡。渝美機於陽光照射下，目標明顯，竟與燈塔相碰，可見其技術惡劣不堪。緣在渝美　空軍優秀機師，多因與日機交綏時喪失殆盡，最近所增援補充者，多為短期訓練所成技能欠佳，經騐尤缺。故駐渝美空軍能力之薄弱，於此可見一斑。</p>

<p>在德軍壓迫蘇　軍於莫斯科或高加索方面的去年或前年，史太林迎接邱吉爾、或英外相艾登、或羅斯福的使節、與這些人們會見的時候，英美以一九三九年秋的德蘇軍事境界綫為蘇聯對歐洲勢力的限界，向蘇聯力說修正一部分國境而使波蘭　芬蘭獨立的必要。並希望蘇聯為西亞的保障，一時傳說英美對蘇的政治工作頗為積極，但至現在，英美對蘇聯的態度，自行改變了，他面，如比起蘇聯軍的廣泛的作戰起來，英美軍的西西里及南義作戰，無論就其所使用的兵力上而言，就其地域而言，且就展開作戰的規模而言，有着很大的距離。蘇聯獨自在東部戰綫來制二百師之衆的德國大兵團，因此，蘇聯以此為理由，在國境問題上，首先主張蘇聯應有最大的發言權，並提出各種要求。這可說是當然的事。前次羅邱的會談中，最重要的據稱就是決定英美對　蘇聯的主張應取何種態度。蘇聯所提出的要求，據傳如此：</p>
<p>蘇聯的要求</p>
<p>地中海問題　蘇聯曾要求應使蘇聯代表參加英美委員會卒獲成功，在地中海問題上，英美以為史太林將任命邁斯基氏為委員，但史太林則任命其親信　辛斯基氏為委員，因為據傳史太林以為邁斯基氏受英國方面的影響過深。即此一事看來，可知蘇聯對地中海的關心之深切。</p>
<p>巴爾幹問題　蘇聯對巴爾幹的主張，無論巴爾幹諸國的國境將如何變更，巴爾幹不能不由蘇聯指導。在此方面，蘇聯正作着各種準備，而最可注目者，此次在蘇聯的外交人民委員會中，着名的東南歐專門家　倫　夫氏被任為巴爾幹司長，</p>
<p>土耳其問題　蘇聯對土耳其的計劃，希望訂定關於使用韃靼尼爾海峽的特別契約。功聯似以為有着無限制使用韃靼尼爾海峽的權利。尤以此次的能夠參與地中海委員，蘇聯不僅造成了可在地中海有直接關心的立塲，在另一方面，如前面所述蘇聯的巴爾幹對策之目標，乃在想找得通亞得利亞海的出路。所以蘇聯的計劃獲得韃靼尼爾使用權，正努力想和地中海及亞得利亞海聯絡的一種表現。</p>
<p>中東問題　蘇聯重新對英美要求決定在伊期的勢力範圍，同時並希望合倂東南伊朗，尤其和蘇屬土耳其斯坦接壤的一帶，這問題恐是英國視為最棘手的問題吧？</p>
<p>蘇聯所計劃的，乃在想把印度周圍諸國，如伊朗、阿富汗，中國內地等，收入自己的勢力範圍，而想鞏固政治的進出地盤。</p>
<p>其他問題　大家知道在一九三〇年之三五年間，蘇聯政府並第三國際對阿拉伯地帶如伊拉克，敘利亞，巴勒斯坦，沙地阿拉伯等諸方面　有着很大的關心，但因本國的內政問題而保持沉默。但最近蘇聯對該方面的關心似又舊事重提，駐土耳其京城蘇聯大使維諾格拉特夫諸氏，極為活躍，和這許多國家的有力者聯絡，蘇聯並想提出摩蘇爾的油田地帶問題。蘇聯最近在土耳其和伊拉的克的接壤地帶北伊拉克伊爾密湖之南增兵，卽足以實地說明這事實，綜上而觀，可見蘇聯之政治進出的方向，先指着蘇聯的西方。蘇聯外交着着占在英美之先，英美究將如何逃避這銳鋒呢？關於此點，如將最近的資料略加說明，則大致如次：</p>
<p>最近的演變</p>
<p>對地中海問題，蘇聯的參加混合委員會，不問結果如何，頗關重大，因蘇聯派遣重要人物，在英美方面以為應予相當警戒。</p>
<p>關於巴爾幹問題，英美想在把巴爾幹引離和德國同盟的名義下，構成以英國為主體的政治集團。但蘇聯所計　的巴爾榦聯邦案，重親保加利亞，反之，英國則計劃擬使土耳其及羅馬尼亞扮演重要的角色。土耳其本身也　希望羅馬尼亞的强大，以為北方的屛障。</p>
<p>關於土耳其問題，有着如下的事實。即在從土耳其的東部，尤以愛爾土魯姆方面　，而蘇聯國境一帶的地域，以英國人技師開始加强軍事設備，完成軍用道路，建船飛機塲，這事實以前是不經見的，頗　重視。</p>
<p>關於中東問題，英軍的加强伊拉克的摩斯爾地方的軍事設備，和蘇聯的增强北伊朗方面兵力，幾同時開始。他方，除蘇聯軍所佔領的北伊朗外，整個伊朗在美軍的支配下，波斯灣的巴士勒港亦入　　人的管理下，全部船舶的活動，亦由美國人監督。英國方面把此方面的管理一切讓之於美國，本身則專事確保埃及，伊拉克　叙利亞，巴勒士　方面。</p>
<p>這是英國方面的聰明，恐怕因伊朗問題而與蘇聯引起對立，預先配置了美軍，假使蘇聯英國的糾紛表面化時、想使美國也牽迎在內。</p>
<p>要之，跟着東部戰綫的進展，而恐懼蘇　外交壓迫增加的英美，首先從事緩和這壓力，而在形式上則不惜卑辭　禮。（翔　自十月七日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>國府軍事委員會同行政院，自九月廿是八日至三十日，召集全國高級軍政長官會議，會期共三日，日方總軍司令總參謀長，最高經濟顧問，最高軍事顧問，曁陸海軍專家相繼演講，對於世界戰局東亞戰局及大東亞戰爭　　信念、分析至為詳盡。日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐於會議之第二日　（廿九），曾以「決戰能　與日本海軍」為題演講，茲錄演詞如次：</p>
<p>東亞面目一新</p>
<p>日本負起建設之使命，發動擊滅英美之神聖戰爭，興師以還，巳歷一年十閱月，其間在中華民團同生共死之熱誠協助下，陸海空三路奏捷，到　擊滅英美強敵，戰略上必要之太泣印度洋及大陸各地諸要點，悉已在我掌握。外滬賊寇其戰意，內重建設，革新經濟文化，大東亞面目一新，緬甸已吿獨立，而非律賓之獨立，為期亦在不遠。在中國國內，自從英美等國入寇以來，久受其束縛，今因交還租界，撤廢治外法權，成理敵產等措施之實行，悄勞頓見刷新，為使中國　復昔日之和平駛土，現正向而邁進中，此已無待贅述。所以能有今日之一天者，上託聖叫之　成，同時國民政府各位閣下及各位長官獻身　國之至誠所致，誠不勝感歆之　。</p>
<p>其間本　軍之行軸自開戰之初的夏威夷馬來海戰以來，力謀獲得其主要目標的太平洋印度洋之制海制空權，同時與精銳陸軍協力將盤據於非島馬來半島。荷印諸島，新幾內亞及大東亞圈內之英美荷陸海空軍悉數殲滅，開戰後未及半載，已達到其目的。西自孟加加灣南至澳洲北邊，東自所羅門羣島，北至阿留申羣島，控制面積，以日本本土大阪為中心，而計算實達六千內不僅如此，日本艦隊之活　遠及馬達加斯加之台哥斯華萊滋灣，或澳洲之雪尼，減自美洲沿岸至大西洋。　囘頭這中間各方面的作戰時、我們自華盛頓會議以來，在　勢比率下苦心孤詣，訓練成功的海軍實力，到處發揮空前成果，日奏　歌，我人在此廣大戰域，目覩歷史上空前之大規模海上作戰，不禁有種種感　。</p>
<p>航空機的活躍</p>
<p>第一：航空機在此次戰爭中之　　的消躍，與在海戰中地位之提高。本來　　之主要目要目要目要目標，有　　敵方主力　時，以控制整個濟　，而使敵方　　風鬥　志，在大東亞戰爭末發生前，以主力艦為中心之組　，在企圖載決一　　之塲合，　　繫於主力艦隊之巨砲之效果，其餘補勤部隊之大砲永青等等的效果，　為此項主力部隊活動之補助的兵力，飛機亦可認為其補助兵力之一部份，但夏威夷馬來海面等處之海戰飛機，發揮絕大之威力，此種載例使從來之戰術思想為之一變，深覺目前之全部作戰，統以飛機為中心而推移。</p>
<p>茲就海上航空戰約略申述，活躍海上航空戰之航空部隊，係由基地航空隊，（以陸上某地為中心而行動之飛機）艦上飛機，（從航空母艦上出發而行動之飛機）編載機，（搭載於巡洋艦以上艦艇之飛機）所組成。至論其種類，係由　載艦上　水上　飛行機　多種合而成，分別　有攻　偵戰鬥等等各種任務。</p>
<p>尤其是在海上，其行動面之廣闊，天　變化之難測。飛降落均受定之限，必須克服各種因難，方克應付其任務，尤須具有特殊之紀飛降落　行方法及戰法，故有訓練上，須要相當之時間與努力。</p>
<p>海戰中，奇襲停泊船雙，在馬來海面海戰中，襲擊航行艦隊，在珊瑚海中途島等處，航空母艦之互相攻擊，我人發揮了近代最新式飛機之性能與多年培育成功之訓練精華。</p>
<p>錯估日本實力</p>
<p>美國首　部在大東亞戰爭之道，以為我日本之飛機在技衡上較歐美落後二三年，即前艦飛機，也完全是不合時代的飛機，且航空工業完全要依靠美國，　　美國之援助，則日本之航空不能成立，在飛機數量方面，佔計　　飛機約一五〇〇架，甚至低佔為五〇〇架。</p>
<p>其錯佔日本航空兵力，結果却於日方有益、在作戰之初，我方獲得光　之航空戰果，將敵人之自負心，山天堂打入地獄，　其在海上及航空兵力上，不得不大加革新。</p>
<p>我海軍飛機所有之偉大的航續力，使英美主將演出飛蛾投火之戰略上錯誤，自從馬來海而海戰以來，屢次遭遇貴命打堅，又日本魚雷攻擊與轟炸之進確，在世界清戰　造成了一大變革。</p>
<p>英俄方面，亦以為飛機不能擊沉戰艦，而日　海軍在開戰之初即用飛機奏大功。誇稱優秀之英美最新式戰鬥機，亦不能與日海軍機之超等航續力駕駛性能相比較，日　海軍　常能獲得以一對十之戰果，使　謂瞪目咋舌？</p>
<p>問戰迄今，在多次雙方空戰　　中敵方的航空兵力，　　於我，在某種　合有多至十　　者，而日　方　　的戰果，常足比敵方還要大上數倍至十倍的戰　此　戰果，均照我人　管道甚之　　而正確公佈，有時同載戰混亂，觀罕不能　實者亦說明其尚未　　。</p>
<p>但英美之報導的，祇知隱瞞其自身之損害，以及　　飛機兵　數量之損失，極力　　他人，肆意反宣傳、對日機之損害發表　常較實數超過數倍或十餘倍、甚至發　之數量，超出我方參加實際實戰之機數，觀察現在所羅門方向之空戰統計，敵方之損害，至少比我方多出四倍至六倍，而有時並在此以上。</p>
<p>美國大言不慚</p>
<p>美國海軍早巳將一制空中之決戰」定為作戰之根本方針，從事整賴兵力，但眞正感覺航空戰之必要者，乃在距今三年前之民國二卞九年六月德軍銜破馬奇諾防綫之時，旋即努力大量製造飛機，訓育空軍人員，　二次覺醒乃為夏威夷及馬來海向海戰之成果</p>
<p>自此以後，即儘力增張航空兵力，綱羅全國航空技術專家，令其硏究最大生產能力，共產生之結果，在現在前航空軍備目標上。在生產方面，據稱去年度為六萬票，本年度十二　五千架，在航　　之訓練方面，海軍每年三萬名，陸軍每年十二萬名，由此可知，其結果欲使海軍增為二萬五千架，陸軍增為七萬架，（當初計劃為三萬五千架）</p>
<p>彼　　次大言不慚自稱：美國飛機先將西部太平洋天空掩蔽，獲得澈底之制空權，然後推動海陸空軍共同作戰，而達到最後目的，然因必要資材此項生產額，亦不能而理想進行，至多實　十分之七，愛侶同中固然亦有素質偉良者，但一度身臨戰塲，在盡忠報國精神　溢之日本優秀航空戰士之前，即能為力矣，此行當日常戰鬥中的事實情證明。（下轉第四版）</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3 id="c33">因故都蠅丐絕跡有感 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>這次京滬記者團十八人北上視察，其遊記中最能使吾人感奮的、　為故都蒼蠅與乞丐經濟的兩段記載：　　蒼蠅：「在平巿各階層的全體動員同時努力以後，……巿內竟告絕跡，所有大小飯館，旅館，飲食店，如見一蠅，即受停業三日五五處分，住戶則須罰欵，執法嚴竣不稍假借，因此造成全城無滬的奇績」。開於乞丐的：「北平因為防疫不但成了蒼蠅之城，同時所有的貧窮乞丐，為了衣衫襤褸，有傳播疫菌的可能，都被集團收容了，所以走過九城，從沒有聽見哀號乞食的悽厲聲浪。」</p>
<p>故經國防疫而能　到蠅丐絕跡，足見一切善良巿政，祇要官民雙方能夠眞誠合作。什麽成績都會做到的。因此，我們不禁要問：上海的「蒼蠅一與乞丐究竟何時可以肅淸絕跡，此地所「蒼蠅」。原來是抽象的，因為上海人民之終日追求於暴利者，正如蠅之附　，不加擠滅，勢必猖獗不可收拾，所以，要澄淸上海的巿塲，必須肅淸上海巿塲上的「蒼蠅」，使其完全絕跡，至於上海的乞丐，非但未能消滅，抑且成為囂張，因為通　大道之中，可以任意奮取，旁若無人，這還不夠囂張嗎？主觀的說，這是一個社會經濟間題，客觀的說，這是一個市民福利問題。不論其為社會經濟，抑為市民福利，「蠅」與「丐」皆當認作經濟上海之玷，亟當有以澈底澄淸之。</p>

<p>遜來百物售價。因當局業厲澈查囤積，成趨下跌，而囤戶紛紛貶價出籠，亦為物價低落之另一原因，各業評價委員會以從前所訂定之限價，理應酌量减低，庶民生得澈底安定。故日來各業公會·正從事該業各種商品限價之重行評訂，務使减經市民負担，而商人亦有正當利潤可獲各業公會近復鑒於一部分商號，對公會業規，日久玩忽，時有陽奉陰違等情，故特新訂業規數條，分令各商號格守勿渝。</p>

<p>靑年航空人員</p>
<p>在我日本國方而，因有南方共榮圈之資源與中華民國之　力，故在飛機及各種武器，資材方而，逐步準　，前綫兵力不亞於　人，航空人員之精神技術，皆能以一當十。</p>
<p>海軍早巳注意於少年航空兵，抽調少年，施以長期適當之訓練，其成績已由夏威夷馬來海戰以來之事實證明，美國之航空人員幹部，大多係由大學專門學校之學生中所採用，我日本海軍之中　幹部，自少年時代即採用為海軍，在光榮的傳統下　以　力訓練，故航空方面之一切事宜，已成習慣，</p>
<p>此等心地純潔忠誠之廿一·二歲的靑年，自從夏威夷馬來海戰以來，常為各部隊的首領，身先士　，奮不顧身，其壯烈可泣鬼神。</p>
<p>我日本目下正在製造大量飛機，栽培大批空軍人員，上次有大學專門學校學生三萬人，中學生七萬人應徵，其熱血義勇服初之精神，實足　泣，其中頗多咬破手指以鮮血寫　志願書者。</p>
<p>又為說明此項制度，　由航空隊及其他方面派遣士官至各學校，當在說明飛行練習生畢業後之待遇問題時，各學生異口同　均謂我等願意立刻趕上前綫殺敵，將來之待遇等，並無考慮之必要，於此可知其報國精神之一斑矣。有此忠　將士與優秀飛機，任憑敵方如何執迷結果被等唯有消耗而巳，所羅門羣島與新幾內亞之一角結果，化為彼等之墳墓</p>
<p>海軍有效作戰</p>
<p>其次再就與空戰協力之下推　有效作戰之海軍的其他方面。略為申述。</p>
<p>夫艦艇之活躍亦可謂係我海軍多年磨練之表現，尤以華盛頓會議以來，努力訓練巡洋艦驅逐艦潛艇及其他各種新　艦艇，過去　戰於各處戰綫屢　奇功，此項艦艇始終與海軍航空機密切協力，或則攻擊敵方航空運　船　，或　破壞佔領敵方之重要地點，一面保護我方之輸送船　，並從事其他各種重要攻防工作。</p>
<p>在過去的菲島，馬來，荷印之戰，近如所羅門方面之激戰，均以事實證明我巡洋艦，驅逐艦等之所謂　快部隊，充分發揮多年磨練成功之實力，無論在白晝，傍晚，黑夜，黎明作戰，均能深入人力勝我數倍之敵陣，克奏　功，其攻擊之猛烈，使敵人心膽俱寒，出奇制勝，髣　孫子之妙計。</p>
<p>常在靜寂之中，展開驚天動地之塲面，每將大隊敵艦，殺得片甲不囘，此等超　　艦艇，在萬燈俱寂之深夜，排成整齊隊伍，以每小時三十海里或四十海里之超速率搜索敵人，在風狂浪激中疾駛，避開敵方之探照燈光綫，冒敵方之密集砲火，迫近可能　中之距離，發射魚雷，在瞬息之間，使敵方巨艦葬身海底，此種事實，在爪哇海　海戰及所羅門附近之數次海戰中，已不遑枚舉，在敵方之破壊通宵戰與我方之保護通宵戰中，此項艦艇，發揮敵方意料之外的戰術，身臨危地，發揚傳統美習，完成其任務。其次，我潛水艦在開戰之初，攻擊夏威夷時，擊沉世界馳名之敵方航空母艦雷克辛頓號，並對其他敵人之艦艇及接濟綫給予重大損害。</p>
<p>潛身海底，備嘗辛勞，以完成任務之潛水艦勇士之功績，尤為可貴，誠如九月廿五日報上發表之井上規矩中佐，與盟邦德國之潛水　船員東西　　，深入敵艦重圍，挺進至阿　島，希加哥夫　，　日間　受敵方之猛烈攻擊，始終不　，前後三次奮身進攻，卒將敵方主力　及重要艦船三艘擊沉擊破。但井上中佐則　全體船　壯烈殉難，不復生還矣。</p>
<p>除上述者外，各種艦艇，各就其本身任務上發揮其全副精神力量，我人際此重大時局，實有研究太平洋上制海制空權的事　戰之必要。</p>
<p>巳入決戰階段</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭開始以　，敵國英美對日戰爭之迷夢，逐次打破，在開戰之初的敗績，已使其銳氣喪　，目前戰局，已入決戰之階段，美國企圖之對日攻　方策，其一：由北方阿留申方面發動之航空戰，其次，由南方所羅門方面發動航空戰，目下之一種方策為從中間地區發動之攻擊。</p>
<p>從北方出動之敵人攻勢，因我方在阿留申之根據地撤退，一時在戰略上似乎敵方已佔優勞，然阿留申一帶夏有濃霧，冬則嚴寒狂風，是以憑今日之飛機能力，欲獲得攻擊之適宜時機，實為難事，我日本之北方防衛，已如磐石之安，艦艇齊備，基她鞏固，猶如金城湯池。</p>
<p>南方之攻擊路綫，即為今日在火藥氣味中之所羅門，新幾內亞方面。</p>
<p>過去一年間之敵方戰果，祇不過我方作戰略上撤退後而得之所羅門羣島一帶三百里之區域，而敵方所蒙之犧牲實大，設美國陸海軍人之家屬一旦知其眞相，不識驚駭至何種程度美國之寶貴資材與生命，徒然葬送於此瘴　為患之珊瑚島上與密林之中，他們所謂：「得此攻彼」之行动，顯然遲遲未進，犧牲如何重大，此皆値得驚異之現象。美國自恃其富源，而浪費驚人，對人民生命之浪費，其比率尤在物資以上，不識美國國民果知此情否？他們的作戰，除為逮到盎格羅撤克遜民族之自私自利外，絕無其他意味，他們無論延續戰事至何時，始終如此浪費人民生命與物力，欲達到作戰目的相距猶遠。</p>
<p>掩飾失敗事實</p>
<p>他們一方面對國民之欺騙工作，亦煞費苦心，是以凡是調派航空關係人員至戰　，決不任其與前曾在職塲作戰之人員謀面，俾可掩飾失敗之事實，關於戰　眞相，並不授以何種　　，含糊交代了事。</p>
<p>他們不知道我日本航空隊與根據地航空隊員之强盛，故在最初之戰鬥中，　為勇敢，乃至二度三度數度之　，意氣漸衰，竟於密林中又為　病與戰爭恐怖　所侵，終至如　廢病人一般，為大東亞建設而視死如歸之我方勇士，雖戰至流最後一滴血，猶在高呼陛下萬歲而從容就義，在其精神上，與敵人實有天壊之別，至於　害之比率，已如前述，彼重我輕，更不成問題。</p>
<p>忽忘日本所有之兵力，而敵人　入我方航空圈內與作戰圈內，其遭遇之結果如何，自有事實可咨證明。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統最近再度高估其本國航空兵力，而欲遺忘其本身對於戰敗之苦痛，此實可認為係堪憐之心理狀態。</p>
<p>在渝美空軍視渝空軍若奴隸，恣意使喚，一時在華南香港廣東方面，與華中揚子江上游方面，展開空中游擊戰，但一經我日本陸軍航空隊出動，莫不各個擊破，他們所謂的前進根據地與軍事設施，均蒙重創，以此為基地而妄想對日空襲，結果化為泡影，然戰爭中，隨時隨地有危險，即一架敵機之蠢動，有時居然可以奏功，故為貫澈同生共死之大義起見，希望中國方面在防空及其他邀擊敵機之配備方面，須有充分準備。</p>
<p>虛張聲勢欺人</p>
<p>次　其對日攻擊之中間地區，此一方面，因飛機根據地極少，故必須有航空母艦之活動。但美國自海戰之初起，先後喪失優秀母艦，今日巳無當初之力量，羅斯福在最近之廣播中稱：巳派二萬五千噸級之新式航空母艦七艘至前綫，大凡作戰必須掩瞞其本身之企圖典行動，此為兵家之常，而羅斯福却將其行動公開吿人，顯然虛張聲勢，欺人宣傳而已。</p>
<p>在太平洋中間地區之行動，自夏威夷海戰以來，顯然形勢不均，足有使美國海軍遭遇全軍覆沒之危險。</p>
<p>以航空母艦為中心之所謂奇襲部隊，在其配置上，必須具備相當强力之戰艦或大型巡洋艦及巡洋艦驅逐艦等之　護艦艇，美國經多年研究結果所產生之航空母艦集團，或輪形陣之形成，在今日已有相當困難。</p>
<p>設他們以少數巡洋艦或驅逐艦等而形成航空母艦集團，一旦接近我國本土，赤手空拳來投我羅綱，此為我人所願望者，總之，在我制空　內或艦隊之行動　內，固他們之來而專以進行艦隊决戰，於彼實為無上之危險，於我則實為無上之幸甚，本來帝國海軍之傳統，不願其不來，而為　陣以待其來，是以進而制　之時，早已算定，退可殲敵之計，上自主將，下至士卒，莫不抱定必勝之心，且備殲敵之力。</p>
<p>今日在此廣大之戰塲，凡我所必要之戰略上要點，悉在掌握，根據無一塞不固，無一處不　之防傭原則進行，在其一時間或　有一部份敵人設入我方防備圈內，亦未可知，但此為一時之現象，在戰略上視之，却可在某一地點捕捉敵人，作戰行動上反而可產生有利之成果。</p>
<p>再論他們誇稱即將開始之緬甸方面戰勢，今日已經孕育相當風雲，但其成果如何，自有事實證明，今日暫可不必表示見解。</p>
<p>義艦隊的投降</p>
<p>九月八日義國巴特利奧政權投降，此為世界歷史上空前之汚導的投降，因之，有一部份義大利艦隊落於英海軍之手，據聞共有主力艦七艘，巡洋艦十六艘，驅逐艦十三艘，潛水艇十四艘。</p>
<p>單就船隻數量言之，英海軍獲得此項勢力，在今後之作戰上，極為有利，但事實決不如此。何以知其無用，蓋　籍船員，自始即無戰意，今後當丕能仍派其戰塲服務，然欲以英美人代替，却又非如此簡單可行。</p>
<p>一切均為高度機械化之海軍舡船式樣機件，稍有不同，則非熟手即不易駕駛，即如學習一種語言，亦非短時期所能完全牢記，何况機件複雜之艦艇。况駕用此等武器與機械，一面尙須作戰，故必須先有相當長時期之訓練，此點與　年學校之學生立刻可以在防空工作上發生作用者，純然不同。</p>
<p>更有困難者，大砲及其他武器之尺寸，與英美出品完全不同，除現在搭載之彈藥以外，欲重新補充一時更不及趕辦。</p>
<p>此項兵器與彈藥庫之補充品殆巳全部為德國所沒收，現在重再描寫圖樣，按照尺寸　製，此事憑英美之生產力豈能勝任。</p>
<p>相信此種艦隊，不久終將葬身於地中海之一角。</p>
<p>退一步言，即以此項艦隊認為可以增强勢力，而英國艦隊的調派相當勢力至印度洋方面，但在戰略上祇能成為　面之弱點，實不足介意。</p>
<p>戰鬥力必須待人與物之能率充分調和後，方能完全發揮，僅　物質之存在，實　何種意味。</p>
<p>總之義大利艦隊　稱燃料　絕，不能行動而投降，但其駛返敵方港灣之燃料，並不缺乏，此種情形，實使凱賽爾以次之無數　國英雄，在地下慟器，　合其和平成功，則巴特里奧等今後依何為準則而教育國民，我人為　國前途，實抱無限同情，東亞民族之精神，常常為貫澈正義而戰，不　正義，　　折矢盡，粉身碎骨、亦必勇戰到底。</p>
<p>必獲最後勝利</p>
<p>我人在十八史略上所學之中國的歷史，深知勢血洒到之處，足使後人正襟。文天祥之正氣歌，在中國不知創造幾多義烈之士，此日本至今猶相傳勿　，當日淸戰爭之際，統華北洋水師之名將丁汝昌提督，其最後之壯烈情形，若令今日之巴特里奧等知曉，雖無恥若彼等，亦必羞愧歐洲情勢之不利於軸心國。我等亦然承認，　確信我等忍受幾許困難與　上下班中之德國國民，及　索里尼政權下之義大利民族，他日必能獲得偉大成果無欵。</p>
<p>戰爭之進退，猶若潮水之上落，刹時間不知有多少次之進退，祇須　門至最後一綫，必能贏得勝利之發冠。</p>
<p>再將大東亞之地圖展開觀察，我人更確信大東亞之黎明巳在目前，我日本與中華民國之衷心提　，實為東亞永久和平之要着，目下南方緬甸巳見復興，菲律賓獨立為期不遠，黎明之鐘響過雲靑，確信其必能完成整個東亞之和平。</p>
<p>英美在東亞一日跳梁，東亞民族一日被視為奴隸，榨取我們之血汗，甚至中國境內之公園，彼等竟然禁止中國人士入內。我人唯有及早覺醒，錯過今日，良機不再。我人切不可兄弟　牆而造成　蚌相爭漁翁得利之蠢舉。</p>
<p>中日兩國之鞏固團結，如能完成，與南方共榮圈之經濟文化交流，設能成功，則我　十萬萬東亞民衆，可以達成永久不移之樂圭，釋迦所謂之極樂凈土，從而可以出現。</p>
<p>我等對於妨碍此樂士建設之一切外力，必須戰至最後方休。</p>
<p>此種建設實可形成今後幾千年之東亞歷史的礎石，為子子孫孫計，乃　必須完成之偉業。（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Discussion on Reorganizing National Education in Shanghai <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The prosperity or decline of a nation, the rise or fall of its politics, all depend on the growth or decline of talent. Talent cannot be obtained without cultivation, and the method of cultivation lies in education. Therefore, all countries, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, that wish for their national fortunes to prosper, invariably attach importance to education, and especially to national education. This is because national education is the mother of all education. Since the 19th century, advanced countries around the world have successively promulgated compulsory education laws, stipulated the age at which children are forced to attend school, and improved the treatment of elementary school teachers, making it a lifelong career for them. All of these are characteristics of the importance attached to national education. Therefore, education can be popularized, talents emerge in large numbers, and the country prospers. Our country has never attached importance to education. Educational expenditures account for a very small proportion of the national and local annual expenditures, and whenever the government's finances are tight, it often suspends or reduces educational funding to make up for the shortfall in other military and political expenditures. As a result, the news of overdue salaries and teachers going on strike is often seen in newspapers. Even if salaries can be paid on time, teachers' salaries are generally very low, insufficient for supporting their families. Therefore, intelligent and talented people, except for those with great aspirations for sacrifice, mostly despise the education profession and do not pursue it. With such a state of education, how can the goal of cultivating talent be achieved? How can it be achieved?</p>
<p>Because public funding is stretched thin, public schools cannot be popularized, so private schools have emerged in response. Among them, there are certainly those who take nurturing talent as their mission, but the majority are purely commercial in nature. Whether the air and light in the school buildings are suitable for hygiene standards? Whether the teachers' knowledge and experience are adequate and pleasant? These are not the questions asked. Their sole purpose is to collect more tuition and spend less, to fill their own pockets. As for enrollment methods, they compete to be different and show off, using advertisements and leaflets as tools of attraction. As a result, parents who are blind to choice, few do not fall into their trap. The loss of fathers and brothers' money is still limited, but the waste of children's time is already regrettably unrecoverable. Therefore, those with good intentions all call these schools "study shops" and advocate that they should be banned if they are unsuccessful, so as not to mislead students. This is by no means an excessive measure. In recent years, the prices of all goods have been high, and it is difficult to make a living. Surely no one is not oppressed by the pressure of life. However, the hardship of life is probably no greater than that of elementary school teachers. Although the burden on students' parents is increasing daily, the treatment of elementary school teachers has not seen a proportionate improvement. We constantly hear the appeals of elementary school teachers, saying either "I can't even get enough to eat for three meals, what energy do I have to teach?" or "I spend all year educating other people's children, only to find that my own children are too poor to have the opportunity to be educated." Under these circumstances, it is absolutely impossible to expect elementary school teachers to serve with peace of mind. From a personal perspective, for the sake of our children's studies; from a broader perspective, for the future of the entire nation, we should all speak out loudly and eliminate this bad phenomenon with effective methods. Moreover, at the same time, there are many students who are at risk of dropping out of school at any time because they cannot afford tuition. We feel that the elimination of this phenomenon cannot be delayed any longer. Judging from the enthusiastic support of scholarships and grain assistance funds by people in the community in recent years, everyone recognizes the relationship between national education and the future of the country, and they also sympathize with the situation of elementary school teachers. We are now going a step further, hoping that national education in Shanghai can be fundamentally improved, and we believe that people in the community will also give it the same sympathy and support.</p>
<p>We are not saying that the situation of secondary and higher education in Shanghai is satisfactory, but we feel that reorganizing national education is the most urgent task, so we advocate that reorganizing education in Shanghai should start with reorganizing national education in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the situation of countries around the world, receiving compulsory national education is both the obligation and the right of the people, so national schools in various countries are established by the state and are not charged. The financial situation of our country and the tax burden on the people are far from comparable to those of other countries, so it is inherently impossible to object to public schools charging tuition and allowing the establishment of private schools to supplement the public schools. However, in terms of the management of private schools, since there are laws and regulations to follow, they should be strictly enforced in accordance with the law, and should not be allowed to become empty words. And today, such bad phenomena occur, and it cannot be said that it is not the neglect of the competent education authorities. We now specifically excerpt the points related to school fees and teacher qualifications in the Elementary School Law and Elementary School Regulations as follows, for the review of the competent education authorities and the research of those who are enthusiastic about education issues:</p>
<p>Article 16 of the Elementary School Law stipulates that private elementary school tuition fees shall be no more than three yuan per person per semester for the primary level and no more than six yuan for the higher level.</p>
<p>Article 57 of the Revised Elementary School Regulations stipulates that, except in special circumstances where special approval is obtained from the competent education authorities, temporary donations for library buildings may be raised from the families of more affluent children, and no fees may be collected from children.</p>
<p>Article 56 of the Revised Elementary School Regulations stipulates that essential school supplies for elementary schools may be issued by the school or a consumer cooperative may be organized to sell them to children at very low prices.</p>
<p>Article 62 of the Revised Elementary School Regulations stipulates the qualifications of elementary school class teachers and specialized teachers. Article 63 stipulates that those who do not have the qualifications stipulated in the above article shall be subject to examination. Article 67 stipulates that qualified teachers shall apply to the competent education authorities for registration. Article 68 stipulates that elementary schools shall only hire teachers who have been registered and announced.</p>
<p>Judging from the above articles, it can be seen that the legal provisions are extremely complete, but the problem is that they have not been implemented. In the case of Shanghai, it was not surprising that this phenomenon occurred in the past when the concessions had not been taken back and the political orders were not unified. But now that the public offices in both districts one and eight have been established at the same time, and Chinese people are handling Chinese affairs, especially something that is extremely important to the country and the nation, it seems that it cannot be ignored any longer. Moreover, the financial situation in both districts one and eight is quite good. In fact, it is not absolutely impossible to increase educational expenditures a little. Regarding the reorganization work, we have only the following five points to suggest:</p>
<p>Request the public offices in both districts one and eight to establish more public complete elementary schools, carefully select teachers in accordance with the prescribed qualifications, and especially reduce tuition fees and set up more free places, as a model, and to benefit the poor.</p>
<p>Conduct registration of private elementary schools, strictly review the income and expenditure of each school, and publicly solicit cooperation from parents and teachers of each school to report tuition fees and treatment, and then, taking into account the general expenditure situation and the affordability of ordinary families, determine uniform tuition standards. (And absolutely prohibit the collection of any fees under false pretenses.) All insufficient funds shall be subsidized by the municipal authorities under the municipal expenditure item or by publicly raising educational donations.</p>
<p>Conduct registration of elementary school teachers (those who do not have the teacher qualifications stipulated in Article 62 of the Elementary School Regulations shall be allowed to register after passing the examination.) And stipulate that in the future, schools shall only hire teachers who have been registered and announced. During the transition period, incumbent teachers may be allowed to continue to serve, but those who fail the examination shall be ordered by the competent education authorities to establish an elementary school teacher training center, ordering them to enter the center for training, and re-test and examine them after a certain period of time. If they still fail to pass, they shall be resolutely dismissed from their duties in order to emphasize the students' studies.</p>
<p>Improve the treatment of elementary school teachers, stipulate the minimum salary standard, and establish elementary school teacher consumer cooperatives, conduct elementary school teacher disease insurance, and formulate special preferential measures for the admission of elementary school teachers' children, or provide subsidies, so that they can serve with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Establish schoolchild consumer cooperatives to supply school supplies at the lowest prices, and absolutely prohibit schools from forcing purchases and profiting from them.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The plan for one year is to plant grain, the plan for ten years is to plant trees, and the plan for a hundred years is to cultivate people." The lack of talent in our country has reached its peak today. The root of the problem is that we do not attach importance to education and cultivate talent, so we dig wells only when we are thirsty, and we are always happy that talent is difficult to find. If we do not act now, it will be too late to regret it. And cultivating talent should start with sound national education. Shanghai is rich in wealth and materials, educational funds are easy to raise, and the culture is relatively high, and it is easy to recruit excellent teachers, so we very much hope that Shanghai will be the starting point for sound national education, and then extend it to the whole country.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Laurel, the First President of the Philippines, Was Inaugurated Yesterday Morning, and the City of Manila Was Filled with Jubilant Air <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Republic of the Philippines was formally established on the 14th under the leadership of President Laurel. At 8:00 a.m. that morning, before the ceremony for the establishment of the Philippines, the Japanese government declared the withdrawal of military administration in the name of the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines. At 9:40 a.m., a solemn ceremony was held in front of the National Assembly Hall for the inauguration of the President of the Republic of the Philippines. Key figures from the Philippines, Mr. Murata, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Japan, Mr. Arisue (Army) and Mr. Yano (Navy), the Supreme Commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy in the Philippines, and representatives from various associations attended the ceremony. The square in front of the ceremonial site was crowded with people, reaching as many as 300,000. First, Executive Secretary Vargas stood up and announced that the military administration of the Great Japanese Empire had been abolished, and expressed his gratitude to Japan on behalf of the entire Philippine people. Then, amid the cheers of the people, Laurel, Chairman of the Independence Preparatory Committee, in a powerful tone, read out the Declaration of Independence, declaring independence to China and foreign countries, and that the Philippines would establish the Republic of the Philippines in order to create a world order of peace, freedom, and justice. At 9:50 a.m., General Aquino raised the flag, and at the same time, the Philippine national anthem was played, and the entire venue was filled with a jubilant atmosphere of celebrating the founding of the country. The capital Manila and temples throughout the Philippines echoed this, ringing their bells in unison to bless the completion of the independence of the Philippines. At 10:05 a.m., Executive Secretary Vargas announced the results of the election of the President. At 10:10 a.m., amid the sound of cannons, Laurel declared his inauguration as the first President of the Republic of the Philippines. Everyone stood up to pay their respects.

Finally, about 10,000 Philippine officials and civilians and people from the Axis countries in the Philippines held a congratulatory parade in front of the ceremonial site, which did not end until noon. The long-cherished wish of the Philippine people has now been realized, and a powerful member has been added to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The situation of the liberation of East Asia and the unity of the entire East Asia will be further strengthened.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Mr. Laurel Announces the Mission of the Republic and Specifically Explains the Grand Plan for Nation Building <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - After Laurel took office as President at 10:15 a.m. on the 14th, he immediately gave a speech, first explaining the significance of the founding of the Philippines and the mission of the Republic of the Philippines, and then gave a specific explanation of his grand plan for building a new Philippines. The main points of his speech are as follows:</p>
<p>Today is the day that the centuries-long struggle of our Philippine nation has finally achieved our</p>
<p>lofty ideals</p>
<p>Our salvation was obtained from this world's great turmoil. We will show the world our true sincerity to His Majesty the Emperor of the Great Japanese Empire, who enabled our nation to achieve its long-cherished wish. The guests from the Great Japanese Empire and other places who are present here are evidence of the traditional friendly relations and mutual understanding between the peoples of East Asia. We express our deepest gratitude to Their Excellencies the Supreme Commanders of the Army and Navy of the Great Japanese Empire, who have shown trust in the people of the Philippines in the past and present. Our Philippines has now become a free and independent country, so our immediate task is to maintain peace and order within our territory. In the future, if there are any unruly elements who hinder our important plans and threaten the existence of the Republic, we will regard them as public enemies of our people and take appropriate measures to deal with them. During the peacetime of the former Commonwealth government, the Philippines still had to import rice and other food from abroad. Now, due to the impact of the war, the shortage of food has become increasingly acute. However, this is not a difficult problem, because the production of our fertile land can supply three times the amount of materials needed by the entire population. In order to exchange materials with various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and implement economic cooperation with the countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, we will readjust the domestic</p>
<p>economic institutions</p>
<p>so as to fulfill the responsibility of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. In order to revive the national economy, we will adopt a sound and stable currency system, guarantee the sound circulation of capital, revitalize new industries, improve transportation facilities, improve road and port equipment, and shipbuilding. In order to adapt to the wartime economy, we will implement a rationing system for essential goods. We must also establish an agency to control prices, because even if we have obtained political freedom, if there is no smooth economy, it will still be nominal. Once the nation's self-sufficient economy is established, we must</p>
<p>attend to</p>
<p>the well-being of the poor and seek various relief measures. If the economy between the various social strata is not balanced, there will be no well-being for the entire population. Fortunately, our country has sufficient arable land, which can be said to be the foundation of our country's economic resources. We must distribute this land to the masses and provide them with material assistance in order to stabilize the economy. All our citizens must take on new responsibilities to change their moral conscience, and we must train them to be a united and dedicated nation. Our Constitution guarantees the maximum degree of freedom</p>
<p>needed to satisfy personal happiness</p>
<p>However, the new citizens must recognize their due obligations and have the spirit of sacrificing their own rights to fulfill their due obligations. Loyalty to obligations should first be exemplified to the people by soldiers and officials. Our education system must be refreshed with the Eastern spirit. The foundations of family and society must strengthen the authority of parents and restore the original status of women in order to make the Filipino family system upward and stable. The government is determined to encourage national language schools and national literature schools, or to strive for popularization and development by means of public documents and general ceremonies. Increasing the birth rate of Tagalogs is also what our country most hopes for. The above is the political aspect of the policies that I am implementing at the beginning of the founding of our Republic. This broad and important undertaking cannot be expected to be completed in a short period of time. Now, fierce battles continue to rage beyond our national borders. We must also remember that many of our country's resources have not yet been developed. Within the limits of our economic capacity, we must at least quickly complete the first stage of our grand plan. In order to achieve the</p>
<p>peace and prosperity</p>
<p>of the people, we must complete the government structure and simplify it in order to manage everything effectively. We must eliminate factional struggles. In the stage of assuming full responsibility for the country, I will not participate in any political parties, only for my only Republic. We should only have one party, the party of the people. I believe that the national flag, the constitution, the national anthem, and the president are the center of the people's unity. The national flag symbolizes the spirit of our warriors and represents the sovereignty of our territory. The national anthem is the business of our nation's hope, so it can be said to be the center of our being. The president is the leader of the people, the root of leadership, and also the center of the country. These four points can awaken the spirit and enthusiasm of all Philippine people. I believe that our people will unite to attack the challenges beyond the horizon. Let us no longer be afraid</p>
<p>with firm faith</p>
<p>Let us move straight forward. We will use</p>
<p>all our strength to dedicate ourselves</p>
<p>to this unprecedented great cause. The one drop of effort that we combine from each individual can become a channel of joint effort, like a torrent of rapid currents, raging and surging, which will turn any obstacle into powerlessness. Only in this way can our only purpose and common determination establish true, permanent, and immortal independence.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Commander Kuroda's Congratulatory Message at the Founding Ceremony of the Philippines <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - The congratulatory message from Commander Kuroda of the Japanese Army in the Philippines at the founding ceremony of the Republic of the Philippines is as follows: The independence of the Philippines is the long-cherished wish of the people of the Philippines. I do not know how many martyrs have sacrificed for this glory. Today, we are fortunate to meet the grand ceremony of independence. All the people of the Philippines are celebrating together, and even the martyrs who are sleeping underground should also be sincerely pleased. The patriotic blood of the martyrs in those years is still abundant in the bodies of the people of the Philippines. I firmly believe that the future of this country must be full of light. The founding of Burma the other day and the birth of the Republic of the Philippines today are both expressions of the spirit of morality. The great undertaking of Xingya is progressing day by day, and Japan's joy is beyond words. The Philippines, unfortunately, was trapped in the war due to the treacherous policies of the United States, and suffered a lot of blows in both people and property. However, the people of the Philippines finally obtained the honor of independence, so I am even more convinced that the people of the Philippines can establish various systems with their own hands, complete an independent country, and become a strong link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At this time when the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more fierce, Japan has the preparation and confidence to resolutely complete the operation. The independence and prosperity of the Philippines will be completely guaranteed by Japan's victory. Japan will spare no effort to cooperate, and hopes that all the people of the Philippines will firmly trust Japan and move forward bravely on the road to completing their heavy tasks.</p>
<p>A Speech Broadcast to the National People</p>
<p>Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - President Laurel of the Republic of the Philippines broadcast a speech to all the people of the Philippines at 7:30 p.m. on the 14th at his residence here, which meant: The independence of our country has been our wish ever since Magellan landed in our country more than four hundred years ago. The Philippines has been a territory of the United States for more than forty years, during which time we have made every effort to strive for independence. Although the Independence Act was passed by the United States Congress, it has not yet been realized. On December 2, 1941, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, after the Japanese army landed in the Philippines, it allowed our country to be independent, because the Japanese army's operation was not to fight with the Philippine people, its purpose was to liberate the various ethnic groups in East Asia. Now that the Japanese promise has been fulfilled, we have declared independence and established the Republic of the Philippines. The President of the Republic of the Philippines is deeply pleased that the Philippines has now been included among the three powers of the world. I still remember that at the beginning of this war, we blindly believed that the United States would allow us freedom, so we endured great sacrifices for the United States. However, the United States never abandoned its policy of oppression, and after the Japanese army landed in the Philippines, it allowed us independence, our past misunderstandings of Japan were completely dispelled. The United States has always claimed to care for the Philippines, we now ask the United States to recognize and respect the independence of the Philippines, and no longer allow the Philippine people to suffer disaster again, in other words, I and all the Philippine people ask the United States to fulfill its past promises, and not to harm the future of the Republic of the Philippines, so that we can freely build our country. I hereby declare that the new Republic of the Philippines is determined to respect the interests of all countries in the Philippines in accordance with international law, and is willing to contribute to the construction of a new world order based on peace, freedom, and morality.</p>
<p>Philippine Tagalog is Designated as the Official Language</p>
<p>Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - Because many different races in the Philippines live in different regions and use various different languages, there is no national language to speak of. Therefore, the Philippine government, which is eager for independence, has already started preparing for the work of unifying the national language before realizing complete independence. According to the languages currently used in the Philippines, there are 87 types, including English and Spanish. When Spain occupied the Philippines, it worked hard to popularize Spanish, and when the United States owned the Philippines, it used English, so English and Spanish are mostly spoken in urban areas and plains, but most residents still use the original languages of their race. As a result, no one language can be used throughout the Philippines. Today, the languages with the widest range of circulation in the Philippines are Bisaya and Tagalog. Bisayans and Tagalogs are more civilized races in the Philippines. The total number of Bisayans is about 7 million, accounting for the first in the population of the Philippines. However, most of the political center figures in the Philippines are Tagalogs, so the Philippines has recently decided to make Tagalog the official language of the Philippines, in order to unify the national language. From then on, due to the unification of languages in the Philippines, its solidarity on the national spirit must be more enthusiastic.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Full Text of the Declaration of Independence <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Manila, 14th - The full text of the Philippine Declaration of Independence is as follows: The spirit of love for freedom is the traditional spirit of the Filipino people. The Filipinos have been ruled by Spain for three hundred years, followed by the United States for more than forty years. During this time, whether in peace or war, they have always struggled continuously to gain freedom. Many martyrs have strived arduously to achieve national liberation. Now, the Philippines, having lost its freedom for many years, has been able to recover it with the assistance of a powerful East Asian nation, which is a just and appropriate return in human history. The Great Japanese Empire, in order to complete this war and liberate the oppressed peoples of Greater East Asia, has eliminated Western forces in the Philippines. The Filipino people have organized the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee to draft a constitution for an independent country and to take necessary measures to build the Republic of the Philippines, in order to realize their long-cherished dream of freedom. We believe that this independence was obtained by the sacrifices of our elders and brothers on various battlefields. We are now independent and recognize independence as the right of all nations in the world, which should be allowed to strive for. We hereby praise our independence as being in accordance with the divine will to enable all nations to attain their proper place. The day we have been hoping for has arrived. We have leapt from the dark hell of a colony to the bright heaven. Here, we have restored the freedom we had more than four hundred years ago. We will not yield to any country. National honor is hereby restored. Due to the realization of freedom, we can utilize unlimited opportunities to strive to carry out the following tasks, free from any foreign interference, to govern our country independently: Develop resources and ensure self-sufficiency. Seek individual and national development without the constraints of political subordination and the persecution of racial discrimination. The thoughts and actions of our ancestors are the best achievements of human history. Follow this to promote spiritual intelligence. Return to the original posture of East Asia, restore the spirit of our ancestors, and build the country in accordance with the will of God and nature. Based on freedom, peace, and morality, the Republic, as part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, will contribute to the creation of a new world order. Strive to achieve the common prosperity of all nations and peoples of Greater East Asia and all mankind, and nurture an independent country as a source of happiness for the Filipino people, both now and in the future, and make it permanent. We pray that God and the spirits of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the motherland will bless us. We hereby declare to the world that we have now gained freedom and independence, and will no longer be subordinate to any foreign country. We have all the powers and rights of a free and independent nation, and we will dedicate all our resources, lives, and honor to defend our territory and preserve our independence. October 14, 1943. Jose P. Laurel, Chairman of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th - The Japanese government issued a statement at 7:30 PM today, as follows: The Philippines has fulfilled its long-cherished wish and declared independence on October 14. The Japanese government immediately recognized it and signed a treaty of alliance with it. The Philippines has been under foreign rule for more than four hundred years, and has continuously strived for independence. The United States agreed to grant independence for its own interests, not for genuine independence, which is known to the people of the Philippines.

In less than two years since then, the people of the Philippines have achieved their long-cherished wish, and the root of the long-standing disaster in East Asia has also been eliminated. At the same time, the future of the construction of a new order is particularly promising. This is truly gratifying for Japan. Within the Greater East Asia region, the Republic of China, Thailand, and Burma are closely cooperating with Japan and jointly fighting to complete the war. Manchukuo is also exerting its total strength and cooperating with Japan with one heart and one mind. Now, with the birth of the new Philippines, all the countries and nations of Greater East Asia have fully developed their natural character, united as one, and strived for the common prosperity of Greater East Asia and the welfare of the world, which is truly gratifying. The Japanese government, in addition to sincerely congratulating the independence of the Philippines, hopes that all countries in Greater East Asia will support each other, rely on each other, respect each other's autonomy and independence, and work together to win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. To complete the construction of Greater East Asia and realize the great ideal of the prosperity of all nations, the Japanese government hereby clarifies its belief to China and foreign countries.</p>

<p>Weak Capacity of the US Air Force Stationed in Chongqing</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th - Recently, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has made extravagant claims of strengthening its aerial offensive, but in reality, its organizational capacity is quite weak, and its flying skills are also extremely poor. A traveler from Fujian recently said that at 4:00 PM on the 9th of this month, he witnessed several US planes stationed in Chongqing attacking forty kilometers east of Shantou. They used machine guns to strafe the lighthouse near the sea. Three other planes, due to the poor skills of the pilots, could not fly close to the land and circled around the lighthouse. Soon, the wings collided with the lighthouse, the fuselage caught fire and burned itself, and was forced to land on the beach. The pilots and the plane perished together. The US planes in Chongqing, with obvious targets under the sunlight, actually collided with the lighthouse, which shows that their skills are extremely poor. Most of the excellent pilots of the US Air Force in Chongqing have been lost in battles with Japanese planes. Most of the recent reinforcements are short-term training graduates with poor skills and especially lack experience. Therefore, the weakness of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is evident.</p>

In order to implement this plan, the British Eighth Army is now advancing in two routes towards the east and north of Monte Tel Saint Nio Mountain, but the above two routes have been destroyed and are being bombarded by German artillery, so the British army's advance is difficult and they are suffering heavy losses.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Ba Regime Declares War; Berlin Does Not Take It Seriously <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th - The German press unanimously pointed out that the declaration of war on Germany by the Badoglio government has no importance either in terms of military operations or politics. "The Berlin Financial News" stated, "On the orders of the pitiful Italian king. This prisoner of McNamara has once again made a publicity stunt, and the challenge to Germany has no military significance whatsoever."</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 14th - Huitong News Agency, Washington: The White House announced yesterday afternoon that Badoglio had notified General Eisenhower that Italy had declared war on Germany. The news was immediately notified to Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 14th - Dispatch from Algiers: The United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union have recognized the Badoglio regime as a "common belligerent."</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th - German News Agency: Regarding the so-called drama of the Badoglio government's declaration of war on Germany, it has been learned here that Badoglio's representative attempted to hand over the declaration of war to the German Ambassador to Spain, Dieckhoff, in Madrid.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 14th - Huitong News Agency: London officially stated yesterday afternoon that although the Allied countries have officially recognized Italy as a joint belligerent, the armistice agreement signed between Italy and the Allied countries remains in effect and cannot be revoked unless the Allied governments conclude a new agreement. This new agreement will depend on the extent of the Italian government's efforts to help in the war.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 14th - Washington: The US Department of the Army announced yesterday that the status of Italian prisoners of war in the United States will not be immediately changed due to the Badoglio regime's declaration of war on Germany.</p>
<h3 id="e13">The Anglo-Soviet Rivalry in the West <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>When German forces were pressing the Soviet army in the direction of Moscow or the Caucasus in the past year or two, Stalin, when meeting with Churchill, or the British Foreign Secretary Eden, or Roosevelt's envoys, the British and Americans used the German-Soviet military boundary line of the autumn of 1939 as the limit of Soviet power in Europe, strongly urging the Soviet Union to revise part of its borders and make Poland and Finland independent.  They also hoped that the Soviet Union would be a guarantor of West Asia. For a time, it was said that the political work of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union was quite active, but now, the attitude of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union has changed by itself.  On the other hand, compared to the extensive operations of the Soviet army, the Anglo-American operations in Sicily and Southern Italy are far behind in terms of the forces used, the region, and the scale of operations.  The Soviet Union alone confronts two hundred divisions of the German army on the Eastern Front. Therefore, the Soviet Union uses this as a reason to first assert that the Soviet Union should have the greatest say in border issues, and put forward various demands.  This can be said to be a matter of course.  It is said that the most important thing in the previous talks between Roosevelt and Churchill was to decide what attitude Britain and the United States should take towards the demands of the Soviet Union. It is said that the demands put forward by the Soviet Union are as follows:</p>
<p>Soviet Demands</p>
<p>Mediterranean Issue: The Soviet Union demanded that Soviet representatives participate in the Anglo-American committee and was successful. On the Mediterranean issue, Britain and the United States thought that Stalin would appoint Maisky as a member of the committee, but Stalin appointed his confidant, Gusev, as a member, because it is said that Stalin thought that Maisky was too deeply influenced by the British side. From this one incident, it can be seen how deeply the Soviet Union cares about the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Balkan Issue: The Soviet Union's position on the Balkans is that no matter how the borders of the Balkan countries change, the Balkans cannot but be guided by the Soviet Union. In this regard, the Soviet Union is making various preparations, and what is most noteworthy is that the famous Southeast European expert, Mr. Rentov, has been appointed as the director of the Balkan Department in the Soviet Foreign Affairs People's Committee.</p>
<p>Turkish Issue: The Soviet Union's plan for Turkey is to hope to conclude a special contract on the use of the Dardanelles Strait. The Soviet Union seems to believe that it has the right to use the Dardanelles Strait without restriction. Especially with this ability to participate in the Mediterranean Committee, the Soviet Union not only created a position where it can directly care about the Mediterranean, but on the other hand, as mentioned above, the goal of the Soviet Union's Balkan strategy is to find a way out to the Adriatic Sea. Therefore, the Soviet Union's plan to obtain the right to use the Dardanelles Strait is a manifestation of its efforts to connect with the Mediterranean Sea and the Adriatic Sea.</p>
<p>Middle East Issue: The Soviet Union has once again asked Britain and the United States to decide on the sphere of influence in Iran, and at the same time hopes to merge southeastern Iran, especially the area bordering Soviet Turkestan. This issue is probably the most difficult one for Britain to handle?</p>
<p>What the Soviet Union plans is to bring the countries around India, such as Iran, Afghanistan, and the interior of China, into its own sphere of influence, and to consolidate its political base.</p>
<p>Other Issues: Everyone knows that between 1930 and 1935, the Soviet government and the Third International were very concerned about the Arab regions such as Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia, but they remained silent due to domestic political issues. However, recently, the Soviet Union's concern for this area seems to have been revived. The Soviet Ambassador to the Turkish capital, Mr. Vinogradov, is very active, and is in contact with influential figures in many countries. The Soviet Union also wants to raise the issue of the Mosul oil fields. The recent increase in troops by the Soviet Union south of Lake Urmia in northern Iraq, in the area bordering Turkey and Iraq, is enough to explain this fact in practice. From the above, it can be seen that the direction of the Soviet Union's political advancement is first pointing to the west of the Soviet Union. Soviet diplomacy is occupying a position ahead of Britain and the United States. How will Britain and the United States escape this sharp edge? Regarding this point, if the recent data is briefly explained, it is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Recent Developments</p>
<p>On the Mediterranean issue, the Soviet Union's participation in the mixed committee, no matter what the result, is of great importance, because the British and American sides believe that they should be quite vigilant about the Soviet Union sending important figures.</p>
<p>Regarding the Balkan issue, Britain and the United States want to form a political group with Britain as the main body by leading the Balkans away from the name of alliance with Germany. However, the Soviet Union's plan for a Balkan Federation emphasizes Bulgaria, while Britain plans to have Turkey and Romania play important roles. Turkey itself also hopes for a strong Romania as a barrier in the north.</p>
<p>Regarding the Turkish issue, there is the following fact. That is, military equipment is being strengthened, military roads are being completed, and airfields are being built, starting from the eastern part of Turkey, especially the area around Erzurum, and the Soviet border, by British engineers. This fact was unprecedented and is quite valued.</p>
<p>Regarding the Middle East issue, the British army's strengthening of military equipment in the Mosul region of Iraq and the Soviet Union's increase in troops in northern Iran began almost simultaneously. On the other hand, except for northern Iran, which is occupied by the Soviet army, the entire Iran is under the control of the US military, and the port of Basra in the Persian Gulf is also under the management of Americans. The activities of all ships are also supervised by Americans. The British side has left all management in this area to the United States, and is dedicated to securing Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Palestine.</p>
<p>This is the wisdom of the British side. It is probably because it is worried that the Iranian issue will cause conflict with the Soviet Union, so it has deployed the US military in advance, and wants to involve the United States if the dispute between the Soviet Union and Britain becomes public.</p>
<p>In short, following the progress of the Eastern Front, Britain and the United States, fearing the increase in Soviet diplomatic pressure, first sought to ease this pressure, and in form, did not hesitate to use humble words and courtesy. (From the Western Asahi Shimbun, October 7)</p>

<h3 id="e32">Decisive Battle Posture and the Japanese Navy - Speech by Colonel Matsushima, Head of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>From September 28th to 30th, the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan of the National Government convened a national conference of senior military and political officials. The conference lasted three days. The Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army, the Chief of Staff, the Supreme Economic Advisor, the Supreme Military Advisor, and experts from the Army and Navy successively gave speeches, providing very detailed analysis of the world war situation, the East Asian war situation, and the Great East Asia War's beliefs. Colonel Matsushima, Head of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China, gave a speech on the second day of the conference (September 29th), entitled "Decisive Battle Capability and the Japanese Navy." The following is a transcript of the speech:</p>
<p>A New Look for East Asia</p>
<p>Japan, shouldering the mission of construction, launched the sacred war to destroy Britain and the United States. Since the launch of the war, it has been one year and ten months. During this time, with the enthusiastic assistance of the Chinese people, the three routes of land, sea, and air have achieved victories, and to destroy the powerful enemies of Britain and the United States, strategically necessary points in the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and mainland have all been brought under our control. Outside, we are destroying bandits and rebels, and inside, we are emphasizing construction, reforming the economy and culture. East Asia has a new look. Burma has declared independence, and the independence of the Philippines is not far off. Within China, which has long been bound by Britain, the United States, and other countries since their invasion, the implementation of measures such as the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the management of enemy property has brought about a new look. In order to restore China to its former peaceful state, we are moving forward. This needs no further elaboration. The reason we can have today is thanks to the sacred achievements, and at the same time, it is due to the devotion of Your Excellencies in the National Government and the dedication of all officials to the country. I am sincerely grateful.</p>
<p>During this time, the axis of the Japanese military's actions, since the battles of Hawaii and Malaya at the beginning of the war, has been to strive to obtain control of the sea and air in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, which are its main goals. At the same time, in cooperation with the elite army, we have annihilated the British, American, and Dutch land, sea, and air forces entrenched in the islands, the Malay Peninsula, the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In less than half a year after the start of the war, this goal was achieved. From the Bay of Bengal in the west to the northern edge of Australia in the south, from the Solomon Islands in the east to the Aleutian Islands in the north, the area controlled, calculated with Osaka in Japan as the center, actually reaches six thousand. Not only that, the activities of the Japanese fleet extend to the Bay of Diego Suarez in Madagascar, or Sydney in Australia, from the American coast to the Atlantic Ocean. Looking back at the operations in various aspects during this period, since the Washington Conference, we have painstakingly trained our naval strength under the ratio of power, and everywhere it has achieved unprecedented results. We are singing victory songs. In this vast theater of war, witnessing the unprecedented large-scale naval operations in history, we cannot help but have various feelings.</p>
<p>The Activity of Aircraft</p>
<p>First: The elimination of aircraft in this war and the increase in their position in naval warfare. Originally, the main goal was to control the entire economy and make the enemy's intentions waver when confronting the enemy's main force. Before the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, in cases where the goal was to decide the outcome in one battle, the focus was on the effect of the giant guns of the main battle fleet, and the effects of the large guns of the other support units were used as auxiliary forces for the activities of this main force. Aircraft could also be considered as part of its auxiliary force, but in the naval battles of Hawaii and Malaya, aircraft exerted tremendous power. This kind of example changed the traditional tactical thinking, and it is deeply felt that the entire current operation is centered on aircraft.</p>
<p>Regarding naval air warfare, the air units active in naval air warfare are composed of base air units (aircraft operating from a land-based center), shipboard aircraft (aircraft operating from aircraft carriers), and embarked aircraft (aircraft carried on cruisers and larger ships). As for its types, it is composed of multiple types, including carrier-based, seaborne, and flying machines, each with various missions such as attack, reconnaissance, and combat.</p>
<p>Especially at sea, the vastness of its operational surface and the unpredictability of weather changes mean that takeoffs and landings are subject to certain limitations. Various difficulties must be overcome to cope with its mission, and it must have special discipline, takeoff and landing methods, and tactics. Therefore, considerable time and effort are required for training.</p>
<p>In naval battles, we have demonstrated the performance of the latest modern aircraft and the essence of training cultivated over many years in surprise attacks on moored ships, attacks on sailing fleets in the naval battle of Malaya, and mutual attacks of aircraft carriers in the Coral Sea and Midway.</p>
<p>Misjudging Japanese Strength</p>
<p>The American senior officials initially believed that Japanese aircraft were two or three years behind Europe and the United States in terms of technology. Even the aircraft of the previous generation were completely outdated. Moreover, the aviation industry was completely dependent on the United States. Without American assistance, the Japanese aviation industry could not exist. In terms of the number of aircraft, it was estimated that there were about 1,500 aircraft, or even as low as 500 aircraft.</p>
<p>Its misjudgment of Japanese air power ultimately benefited Japan. At the beginning of the war, our side achieved brilliant air combat results, sending the enemy's arrogance from heaven to hell, forcing them to make major reforms in their naval and air power.</p>
<p>The great range of our naval aircraft led the British and American commanders to make strategic errors of moths flying into the fire. Since the naval battle of Malaya, they have repeatedly encountered hard blows. Also, the accuracy of Japanese torpedo attacks and bombing has brought about a major change in the world of pure warfare.</p>
<p>The British and Russian sides also believed that aircraft could not sink battleships, but the Japanese navy achieved great success with aircraft at the beginning of the war. The so-called excellent British and American latest fighter planes also could not be compared with the superior range and driving performance of Japanese naval aircraft. The Japanese navy often achieved a ratio of one to ten in battles, causing those who heard of it to be stunned.</p>
<p>Since the start of the war, in many air battles between the two sides, the enemy's air power has often exceeded ours. In some cases, there have been as many as ten times as many, but the results achieved by the Japanese side have often been several to ten times greater than those of the enemy. These results are all publicized accurately according to our channels. Sometimes, in confused battles, it is also explained that those whose observations cannot be verified have not yet been.</p>
<p>However, the British and American reports only know to conceal their own damage, as well as the loss of aircraft and personnel, and try to mislead others, engaging in counter-propaganda. The damage to Japanese aircraft is often reported to be several times or more than ten times higher than the actual number, and even the number of aircraft dispatched exceeds the number of aircraft actually participating in combat. Observing the air combat statistics in the Solomon Islands direction, the enemy's damage is at least four to six times greater than ours, and sometimes even more.</p>
<p>The United States is Shameless</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy has long set "decisive air control" as the fundamental principle of operations, engaging in the reorganization of troops. However, the real sense of the necessity of air warfare came only three years ago, in June of the 29th year of the Republic of China, when the German army broke through the Maginot Line. Immediately, they worked hard to mass-produce aircraft and train air force personnel. The second awakening was the result of the naval battles of Hawaii and Malaya.</p>
<p>Since then, they have tried to increase their air power, recruiting aviation technology experts from across the country, ordering them to research the maximum production capacity. The result is that in the current goal of air force preparation, in terms of production, it is said that last year was 60,000 votes, and this year is 125,000 aircraft. In terms of training, the Navy trains 30,000 people per year, and the Army trains 120,000 people per year. From this, it can be seen that the result is to increase the Navy to 25,000 aircraft and the Army to 70,000 aircraft (the original plan was 35,000 aircraft).</p>
<p>They shamelessly claim that American aircraft will first cover the skies of the western Pacific, obtain thorough air control, and then promote the joint operations of the army, navy, and air force to achieve the final goal. However, due to the necessary materials, this production volume cannot proceed ideally. At most, it is actually 70%. Among the soldiers, there are certainly those who are of excellent quality, but once they are personally involved in the battlefield, they are no match for the outstanding Japanese air warriors overflowing with the spirit of serving the country with loyalty. This is a fact that is proven in daily combat. (Continued on page 4)</p>
<p>Comments from the Economic World</p>
<h3 id="e33">Feelings on the Disappearance of Flies and Beggars in the Former Capital <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Of the travelogues written by the 18 members of the Beijing-Shanghai journalist delegation who went north to inspect, the two passages that most inspire us are the records of the flies and beggars in the former capital: Regarding flies: "After the full mobilization of all levels of Ping City and their simultaneous efforts, ...flies have completely disappeared from the city. All large and small restaurants, hotels, and food shops will be closed for three to five days if a fly is seen, and residents will be fined. The enforcement of the law is strict and does not allow any leniency, thus creating the miraculous achievement of a city without flies." Regarding beggars: "Because of epidemic prevention in Beiping, it has not only become a fly-free city, but also all the poor beggars, because their clothes are tattered and they may spread germs, have been taken in by groups. Therefore, walking through the nine cities, we have never heard the miserable sound of wailing for food."</p>
<p>Therefore, the fact that epidemic prevention in the former capital has been able to achieve the disappearance of flies and beggars shows that as long as the government and the people can cooperate sincerely, all good municipal administration can achieve results. Therefore, we cannot help but ask: When can the "flies" and beggars of Shanghai be completely eliminated? The "flies" here are abstract, because the people of Shanghai who pursue exorbitant profits all day long are like flies attached to things. If they are not squeezed out and eliminated, they will inevitably become rampant and uncontrollable. Therefore, to clear the Shanghai market, it is necessary to eliminate the "flies" in the Shanghai market and make them completely disappear. As for the beggars in Shanghai, not only have they not been eliminated, but they have become arrogant, because they can arbitrarily beg in the main streets, as if there is no one else around. Is this not arrogant enough? Objectively speaking, this is a social and economic issue. Subjectively speaking, this is a citizen welfare issue. Regardless of whether it is a social economy or citizen welfare, both "flies" and "beggars" should be regarded as a stain on the economic Shanghai, and there should be a thorough cleansing.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Evaluation Committee of Various Industries Re-evaluates Price Limits - Appropriately Reducing to Ease the Burden on Citizens <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the prices of all commodities have been declining. This is because the authorities have strictly investigated hoarding, leading to a downward trend, and hoarders have been lowering prices to get rid of their stocks, which is another reason for the drop in prices. The Evaluation Committee of Various Industries believes that the price limits set in the past should be appropriately reduced so that people's livelihood can be thoroughly stabilized. Therefore, in recent days, various industry associations have been re-evaluating the price limits of various commodities in their respective industries, so as to reduce the burden on citizens while allowing merchants to obtain legitimate profits. Various industry associations have also recently, in view of the fact that some merchants have long neglected the industry rules of the association and sometimes act in a superficially compliant but actually disobedient manner, specially revised several industry rules and ordered all merchants to strictly abide by them without changing.</p>
<p>Newly Revised Industry Rules</p>
<p>The main ones are: Those who specialize in wholesale of commodities are limited to wholesale existing goods to local retail merchants; they must refuse to wholesale to people outside the industry and merchants outside the industry. There must be no illegal short selling in various industry markets. All dutiable goods transactions are limited to merchants in the respective industries. All factories, companies, and businesses must join the association. Non-members of the association shall not engage in the buying and selling of various items. If the price is to be changed due to cost reasons, the association should forward the request to the authorities for approval. Only after approval can the association notify the change; otherwise, it will be regarded as an illegal price increase and punished according to law. Retailers should mark the price of each item sold and must issue a sales invoice. If there is a shortage of goods, they must not take advantage of the situation to hoard and raise prices, change grades, or engage in any other improper behavior. All items that have been evaluated and price-limited must be responsible according to the evaluated price limit, regardless of whether they are wholesalers or retailers, and must not deliberately violate it.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Financial Inspection Offices Established in Bengbu and Ningbo <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>After the Central Reserve Bank's General Affairs Office for Financial Inspection completed the inspection and correction of the business operations of financial institutions (including banks, money shops, and trust companies) in the local financial area, it continued to promote the financial inspection work in various cities in the interior. In addition to the establishment of branch offices in cities such as Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Hankou, which are carrying out inspection work in accordance with the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions, the planned Bengbu and Ningbo branch offices are said to have been organized and established, and the inspection task is progressing smoothly. It is said that branch offices in other regions are also being planned and gradually set up, so as to ensure that the financial institutions of the country are under the control of the Ministry of Finance and follow the correct path to thoroughly stabilize finance.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Trend of Chinese Stocks <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stocks were unpredictable, first leveling off and then expanding machinery capital, then turning down. Ultimately, some stock prices turned from falling to rising. Because the weak ground had stabilized and the selling subsided, the yarn gang, Guangdong gang, and others suddenly rose together in the afternoon, with Wing On Company as the investment target, suddenly driving up the price. Other stocks also followed upwards. The morale of all parties, which had just been tired, was re-excited, and transactions were brisk. The following is a record of the stock situation in various industries.</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On Company fell in the morning, but suddenly rebounded at noon. In the afternoon, the buying was strong, with the highest being the final transaction price, rising one level compared to the previous day. Sincere Company entered the pass and returned in the afternoon, also showing a rise. China National Products Wharf was leveled after a slight rise in the morning. China Underwear was slightly lower after the market, and both Sincere and Wing On Department Stores ended up weakened.</p>
<p>Textiles: Da Sheng Factories 1, 2, and 3 were raised by buyers. Wing On Textiles returned to level after fatigue, with the fluctuations getting narrower. Yuanfeng, Fuchang, and Rongfeng Textiles all fell slightly. Tianlun was the only one that rose, with the price being high. The weaving stocks such as Da Zhonghua remained flat. Zuifu Socks opened at the original price, and the prospect was slightly lower.</p>
<p>New Medicines: Xin Ya Hua Factory slightly decreased and then returned in the afternoon. Zhongfa was leveled, Wuzhou was slightly lower, and Zhongxi, Zhongying, Xinyi, and Xinxing were all flat.</p>
<p>Industry: Da Zhonghua Firecrackers was the weakest. Huacheng and Nanyang Tobacco Companies had few transactions and the market was tired. Jiu'an Industry also showed a significant decline. Daqin Huashi returned to level after expanding. Xin Ya Jianye had small fluctuations. Datongying was the only one to rise. Guohua Investment had quite active transactions, and both Guohua and China Investments saw a small rise. Kangyuan Canned Food and Meilin Canned Food both showed a decline. Sanyou and Cixi Taihou's Empty Court Industry also showed a decline.</p>
<p>Culture: Zhonghua Bookstore had transactions outside the pass. Commercial Press and World Book Company were both firm. Yongxiang Printing and Standard Paper Products were average.</p>
<p>Real Estate: Xin Yi was the flattest. Lianhua and Yongxing both showed a decline.</p>
<p>Public Utilities: Zhabei Water and Electricity returned to the pass. Huashang Electric and Xinyi Machinery were both flat.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday, the market still tended to be weak and tired, hovering around. The rise the day before did not have the strength to continue to pull up. It was heard that the yarn gang bulls were gradually coming out, so the market was temporary and difficult to improve. Yesterday, Bingli's initial price was raised, which attracted sellers, and they immediately became weak again. This is because the supply exceeded the demand and returned to small. The other two types, B and D, were unattended. The E type was higher than four, and it was still hovering uncertainly.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Soap and matches were suspended due to the announcement by the First and Eighth District Offices that inventory registration would begin from today, resulting in a halt to transactions between buyers and sellers, and prices also fell sharply. Cigarettes are rising steadily, because inventories are exhausted and prices have soared. The future trend still needs to be seen as high.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate: The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association was not changed yesterday morning. It is still listed as two jiao.</p>
<p>Medicinal Materials: It is still peaceful here, because customers are selling. Only retail sales are being made in this street, and transactions are light. The market is not very colorful.</p>
<p>Grains: It was still soft as before yesterday, because the autumn harvest of crops was abundant, and farmers' accounts often had suspicious and difficult diseases. The rice and grain were at low prices again, and the oil and grain lacked wholesale buyers.</p>
<h3 id="e38">News Briefs <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Limin Bank and the Bank of Communications Head Office are jointly launching rural loans to promote agricultural finance in the interior. The allocation and lending methods for these funds were officially signed yesterday in a contract and will be implemented immediately. These loans will be provided to individual farmers, production mutual aid societies, or rural granaries. Baoshan, Ding, Kunshan, Tai, and Pinghu five counties are provisionally designated as loan areas, and expansion will gradually occur.</p>
<p>Due to business development, the local China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Company has increased its capital to 1.65 million yuan and submitted it for registration and approval. The company is scheduled to issue new stocks from today.</p>

<p>Young Aviation Personnel</p>
<p>In our Japan, thanks to the resources of the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere and the manpower of the Republic of China, we are steadily making progress in aircraft and various weapons and materials. The frontline military strength is no less than that of any country, and the spirit and technology of our aviation personnel enable each to be as effective as ten.</p>
<p>The Navy has long paid attention to young aviation soldiers, selecting youngsters and giving them long-term, appropriate training. The results have been proven by the facts since the Hawaii and Malaya naval battles. The leadership of American aviation personnel is mostly drawn from students of universities and specialized schools. In the Japanese Navy, middle-level officers have been recruited from a young age and trained rigorously under a glorious tradition, so everything related to aviation has become second nature.</p>
<p>These pure-hearted and loyal young men of 21 or 22 years of age have often been the leaders of various units since the Hawaii and Malaya naval battles, taking the lead and disregarding their own safety. Their bravery is enough to move gods and spirits.</p>
<p>Our Japan is currently manufacturing a large number of aircraft and cultivating a large number of air force personnel. Last time, 30,000 university and specialized school students and 70,000 middle school students applied. Their spirit of passionate and courageous enlistment is truly moving. Many of them even bit their fingers and wrote their applications in blood.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to explain this system, officers are dispatched from the air corps and other areas to various schools. When the issue of the treatment of flight trainee graduates is explained, all the students unanimously say that they are willing to rush to the front lines to kill the enemy immediately and that there is no need to consider future treatment. From this, we can see a glimpse of their spirit of serving the country. With such loyal soldiers and excellent aircraft, no matter how stubbornly the enemy persists, the only result will be consumption. The Solomon Islands and a corner of New Guinea will eventually become their graveyards.</p>
<p>Effective Naval Operations</p>
<p>Next, I will briefly elaborate on other aspects of the Navy that promote effective operations in cooperation with air combat.</p>
<p>The activity of naval vessels can also be said to be a manifestation of the Navy's many years of training. In particular, since the Washington Conference, we have strived to train cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and other new types of ships. In past battles on various fronts, we have repeatedly performed miraculous feats. These ships have always worked closely with naval aircraft, attacking enemy air transport ships or destroying and occupying important enemy locations, while protecting our own transport ships and engaging in various other important offensive and defensive tasks.</p>
<p>In the past battles of the Philippines, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies, and more recently in the fierce battles in the Solomon Islands, the so-called rapid units of our cruisers and destroyers have fully demonstrated the strength honed over many years. Whether fighting in daylight, dusk, darkness, or dawn, they can penetrate deep into enemy formations that are several times more numerous and achieve miraculous feats. Their fierce attacks make the enemy feel cold in their hearts and livers, and they achieve surprising victories, like the wonderful plans of Sun Tzu.</p>
<p>They often unfold earth-shattering scenes in silence, killing large enemy fleets and leaving them in disarray. These super-powered vessels, in the quiet of the night, form neat formations, searching for the enemy at super speeds of 30 or 40 nautical miles per hour, speeding through wild winds and waves, avoiding enemy searchlight beams, braving enemy concentrated artillery fire, approaching within striking distance, and launching torpedoes, instantly burying enemy giant ships at the bottom of the sea. These facts have been countless in the Java Sea naval battle and several naval battles near the Solomon Islands. In the enemy's destructive night battles and our protective night battles, these ships have displayed tactics unexpected by the enemy, facing danger and carrying forward traditional virtues to complete their missions. Secondly, our submarines, at the beginning of the war, when attacking Hawaii, sank the world-famous enemy aircraft carrier Lexington and inflicted significant damage on other enemy ships and supply lines.</p>
<p>The achievements of the submarine warriors who endured hardships deep under the sea to complete their missions are particularly commendable. As Inoue Kikunori, a lieutenant commander, stated in a report published on September 25, he and the submarine crew of our ally Germany penetrated deep into the enemy's encirclement, advanced to Attu Island, and Chicagof Harbor, endured fierce enemy attacks day and night, never wavered, and launched three successive attacks, finally sinking or destroying three of the enemy's main forces and important ships. However, Lieutenant Commander Inoue and all the crew members died bravely and did not return alive.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, all kinds of ships have exerted their full spiritual strength on their respective missions. We must study the facts of controlling the sea and air in the Pacific Ocean in this important situation.</p>
<p>Already Entered the Decisive Battle Phase</p>
<p>Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the enemy countries of Britain and the United States have gradually shattered their dreams of war against Japan. The defeats at the beginning of the war have caused their morale to wane. The current war situation has entered the decisive battle phase. The United States' attempts to attack Japan have three strategies: first, an air war launched from the northern Aleutian Islands; second, an air war launched from the southern Solomon Islands; and the current strategy is an attack launched from the central region.</p>
<p>The enemy's offensive from the north, due to our withdrawal from our base in the Aleutian Islands, seems to have given the enemy a strategic advantage for a time. However, the Aleutian Islands have heavy fog in summer and severe cold and strong winds in winter, so it is difficult to find a suitable opportunity to attack with today's aircraft capabilities. Japan's northern defenses are as solid as a rock, with complete ships and a consolidated base, like a golden city and a soup pool.</p>
<p>The southern attack route is the Solomon Islands and New Guinea area, which is currently filled with the smell of gunpowder.</p>
<p>The enemy's achievements in the past year have only been the 300-mile area around the Solomon Islands that we obtained after a strategic retreat, while the enemy's sacrifices have been great. If the families of American soldiers and sailors knew the truth, to what extent would they be horrified? The United States' precious resources and lives are being buried in these coral islands and dense forests plagued by miasma. Their so-called "attacking here and attacking there" actions are clearly slow to progress, and the magnitude of the sacrifices is astonishing. The United States relies on its wealth and wastes it astonishingly. The rate of waste of human lives is even higher than that of materials. Do the American people know this? Their operations have no other meaning than to achieve the selfishness of the Anglo-Saxon race. No matter how long they continue the war, they will continue to waste people's lives and resources, and the distance to achieving their war aims is still far.</p>
<p>Concealing the Facts of Failure</p>
<p>They have also worked hard to deceive their people, so they never allow aviation personnel assigned to the war zone to meet personnel who have previously fought in the workplace, so that they can conceal the facts of failure. They do not provide any kind of information about the truth of the war, and they deal with it vaguely.</p>
<p>They do not know the strength of our Japanese air corps and base airmen, so in the initial battles, they were brave to the point of fighting two, three, or several times, but their morale gradually declined, and they were eventually invaded by miasma and war terror in the dense forests, and they ended up like disabled people. Our brave warriors, who regard death as returning home for the construction of Greater East Asia, even if they fight to the last drop of blood, still shout "Long live the Emperor" and calmly meet their deaths. In their spirit, there is a world of difference from the enemy. As for the ratio of damage, as mentioned earlier, they are heavy and we are light, which is not a problem.</p>
<p>If the enemy forgets all of Japan's military strength and enters our air circle and combat circle, the results they will encounter are proven by the facts.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt recently overestimated his country's air power again and wanted to forget his own suffering from defeat. This can be regarded as a pitiable psychological state.</p>
<p>The American air force in Chongqing treats the Chongqing air force as slaves, ordering them around at will. For a time, they launched air guerrilla warfare in the South China, Hong Kong, Guangdong, and upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Central China, but once our Japanese army air corps was dispatched, they were all defeated one by one. Their so-called forward bases and military facilities were severely damaged, and their fantasies of launching air raids on Japan from these bases were shattered. However, there is danger at any time and place in war. Even the slightest movement of an enemy plane can sometimes succeed, so in order to implement the great righteousness of living and dying together, it is hoped that the Chinese side will have full preparations for air defense and other equipment to intercept enemy planes.</p>
<p>Bluffing and Deceiving People</p>
<p>Next, regarding their attack on Japan from the central region, there are very few air bases in this area, so aircraft carriers must be active. However, the United States has lost excellent carriers one after another since the beginning of the naval war, and it no longer has its original strength. Roosevelt said in a recent broadcast that seven new aircraft carriers of the 25,000-ton class have been sent to the front lines. It is common practice for military strategists to conceal their own intentions and actions in war, but Roosevelt publicly announced his actions to others, which is clearly a bluff and deceptive propaganda.</p>
<p>Actions in the central Pacific region, since the Hawaii naval battle, have clearly been uneven, enough to put the US Navy in danger of being completely annihilated.</p>
<p>The so-called surprise attack force centered on aircraft carriers must be equipped with considerable strong battleships or large cruisers and escort ships such as cruisers and destroyers. The formation of the aircraft carrier group or wheel formation that the United States has produced after years of research is quite difficult today.</p>
<p>If they form an aircraft carrier group with a small number of cruisers or destroyers, it would be our wish that they approach our country unarmed and throw themselves into our net. In short, it would be extremely dangerous for them and extremely fortunate for us to come within our air control sphere or fleet action sphere and engage in a fleet decisive battle. Originally, the tradition of the Imperial Navy is that it does not want them to come, but it sets up an ambush to wait for them to come, so the plan to advance and control the sea or retreat and annihilate the enemy has long been calculated. From the commander-in-chief to the soldiers, everyone is determined to win and is prepared to annihilate the enemy.</p>
<p>Today, in this vast battlefield, all the strategic points that we need are under our control, and the principle of "no fortress is not strong, no place is not fortified" is followed in the defense. It is also unknown whether a certain part of the enemy will set up within our defense circle for a certain period of time, but this is a temporary phenomenon. Strategically, it can capture the enemy in a certain location, and operational actions can produce favorable results.</p>
<p>Regarding their boast that the battle in Burma is about to begin, considerable clouds have already gathered today, but the results will be proven by the facts. There is no need to express opinions for the time being.</p>
<p>The Surrender of the Italian Fleet</p>
<p>On September 8, the Italian Badoglio regime surrendered, which was an unprecedented shameful surrender in world history. As a result, a part of the Italian fleet fell into the hands of the British Navy. It is reported that there are a total of seven battleships, sixteen cruisers, thirteen destroyers, and fourteen submarines.</p>
<p>In terms of the number of ships alone, the British Navy has gained this strength, which is extremely favorable in future operations, but the fact is definitely not so. How do we know it is useless? Because the Italian crew members have had no fighting spirit from the beginning, and they will not be able to send them to the battlefield in the future. However, it is not so simple and feasible to replace them with British and American personnel.</p>
<p>Everything is highly mechanized. Naval vessels have different styles of machinery, and it is not easy for novices to drive them. Even learning a language cannot be completely remembered in a short period of time, let alone warships with complex machinery. Moreover, one must operate these weapons and machinery while fighting, so one must first have a considerable long period of training. This is completely different from students in teenage schools who can immediately play a role in air defense work.</p>
<p>What is even more difficult is that the sizes of cannons and other weapons are completely different from those produced by Britain and the United States. Apart from the ammunition currently loaded, it is too late to replenish them temporarily.</p>
<p>The replenishment of this weaponry and ammunition depot has almost all been confiscated by Germany. Now, re-sketching the drawings and producing them according to the dimensions, can the productivity of Britain and the United States be competent for this?</p>
<p>It is believed that this fleet will soon be buried in a corner of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>To take a step back, even if this fleet is considered to increase its strength and the British fleet deploys considerable strength to the Indian Ocean, it can only become a weakness on one side strategically and is not worth caring about.</p>
<p>Fighting power must be fully developed after the energy of people and materials is fully harmonized. The mere existence of materials has no meaning.</p>
<p>In short, the Italian fleet claimed to be out of fuel, unable to move, and surrendered, but there was no lack of fuel to drive them back to the enemy's port. This situation made countless patriotic heroes after Kaiser cry in the ground. If their peace is successful, then what will Badoglio and others use as a criterion to educate the people in the future? We have unlimited sympathy for the future of their country. The spirit of the East Asian people is always to fight to the end for justice. Without justice, even if their arrows are broken and their bodies are shattered, they must fight bravely to the end.</p>
<p>Must Achieve Final Victory</p>
<p>We know from the Chinese history we learned in the Eighteen Histories that the place where blood is shed can make future generations upright. Wen Tianxiang's Song of Righteousness has created countless righteous and heroic people in China, which Japan still passes down. At the time of the Sino-Japanese War, Ding Ruchang, the famous admiral who commanded the Beiyang Fleet of North China, if his last tragic situation were known to today's Badoglio and others, even if they were as shameless as they are, they would be ashamed of the unfavorable European situation for the Axis powers. We also acknowledge and firmly believe that we will endure some difficulties and the German people in shifts and the Italian people under the Mussolini regime will surely achieve great results in the future.</p>
<p>The progress and retreat of war is like the rise and fall of the tide. I don't know how many times there will be progress and retreat in an instant. As long as we hold on to the last line, we will be able to win the crown of victory.</p>
<p>If we unfold the map of Greater East Asia and observe it, we are even more convinced that the dawn of Greater East Asia is already in sight. The sincere cooperation between Japan and the Republic of China is essential for the permanent peace of East Asia. At present, the south of Burma has been restored, and the independence of the Philippines is not far away. The bells of dawn have rung past the clouds, and we are convinced that it will be able to complete the peace of the entire East Asia.</p>
<p>If the United States and Britain run rampant in East Asia for one day, the East Asian people will be regarded as slaves for one day, extracting our blood and sweat. They even prohibit Chinese people from entering parks in China. We must awaken as soon as possible. If we miss today, the good opportunity will not come again. We must not engage in the foolish act of brothers fighting each other and causing the fisherman to profit.</p>
<p>If the solid unity between China and Japan can be completed, and the economic and cultural exchange with the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere can be successful, then our 400 million East Asian people can achieve permanent and unchangeable happiness, and the Pure Land of Bliss described by Sakyamuni can then appear.</p>
<p>We must fight to the end against all external forces that hinder the construction of this Land of Bliss.</p>
<p>This construction can form the cornerstone of East Asia's historical cornerstone for thousands of years to come. For the sake of our children and grandchildren, it is a great cause that must be completed. (The End)</p>
