<h3 id="c1">鐵道交通亟待改善 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>上海南京間及上海杭州間鐵道交通，是華中區國民經濟上的大動脈，在全國物資交流各方面，具有最重要的意義。因此，凡是有識之士，都明白，要振興華中各業，是重要的，首先必須發展京滬及滬杭兩路交通事業；反過來說，如果這兩路的交通發生什麼問題，那麼，立刻就會影響到上海·華中乃至全國的經濟與民生。不久以前，因爲上海車站對於旅客處理辦法有欠妥善，以至影響兩路行旅，本報以市民共同之感覺而提請改善，深蒙有關當局注意，一度加以改善，行旅稱便，華中鐵道當局這種從善如流的美德，極爲各界所欽敬。不過，歷時未久，而兩路交通行旅上竟有發生更嚴重的不良現象，殊出吾人之意料。</p>
<p>綜合最近讀者所投函：對兩路行旅之不便，主要者有如决諸點：（一）京滬·滬杭兩綫車票之不易購得，往往須等待至二三日以上，此種情形，實屬罕見，因爲車票難得，於是發生黑市。（二）上述兩路旅客，雖已購得車票，亦不能立即搭車，往往亦有須等候二三日之事實者。往返徒勞，虛耗時間·金錢與心力不少。（三）上述兩路之放客車票，限制發售之額數過少，例如蘇州至上海間三等票限額位數百張，實際上在站可購又僅爲此限額的一部份。（四）車站上購票及進站進車之手續仍嫌過於繁瑣，虛耗時間過多，殊失戰時節的之眞意，蓋時間與人力之浪費，與金錢物資相等也。（五）少數鐵路工作人員及鐵路警員，對於他們的本職。服務道德及對旅客態度，頗有引起一部份旅客之反感。特別嚴重的怪現象，還有（六），即所謂「單幫商販」之充斥於兩路各車，他們的車票來源，他們所販運物資楚吾違反統制法令，都不是簡單的問題。所有兩路這種最東要的不良現象，影響極大，不容忽視。</p>
<p>關於前述兩路目前種種現象之所以發生的原因，我們局外人自然不便妄加揣測，希望華中鐵道當局以過去担白之態度，進行嚴密之檢討與研究。就事實而論，我們希望對於下列幾點，能在最近期內加以改善。積極方面：（一）爲着發展華中經濟，京滬滬杭兩路必須設法增加車輛及開車班次。並設法調整客車與貨車的班次，務使得宜。近來京滬間已增班次，但對於一班正當旅客，尚無實際補益，今後當謀更妥善之法，以减少客車過於擁擠的現象。（二）改善發售車票及乘車手續，使正當旅容皆可在車站及時買到車票，並及時搭車，以免在購買車票及進站乘車前浪費時間·金錢與心力。乘車手續及規則，應力求簡單明瞭，使人人易於了解及遵守。消極方面：（一）宜以最大決心，取締車票之黑市交易。（二）改善旅客及其行李的檢查辦法，明定檢查規則。時間·檢查人，並儘可能的减少檢查的次數與時間。（三）嚴厲取締單幫商販，以便一般正當旅客。事實上目前兩路車輛，幾有大半爲此種單幫商販服務，加以取締以後，旣可制止物資走私，及消除上海與內地過高過低的物價差額，即在鐵路正當收益上亦大有補助。</p>
<p>正因爲京滬滬杭兩路是關係華中與全國國民經濟與物資交流的大動脈，必須力謀改善，不容有任何畸形現象存在。雖一時不能與日本鐵路經營相競，至少亦應回復事變前該路的情形。爲此，我們竭誠盼望關係方面努力加以注意，吸收中日專鬥人才，從事於研究改善工作，同時對於鐵路從業人員，從高級職員至搬運伕役，以及鐵路警衛人員等，進行整飭與敎育，改善及保障共生活，提高其服務道德，消除對正當旅客不敬與不當的態度。除此以外，我們還盼望於各界的兩點：一是希望關係方面與企業界協力，改善及開闢輔助鐵路的交通，尤其是內河水運等，增這木船及小型機器運輸船，以减輕火車的負担，另一是盼望社會各界，除非萬不得已，還是共體時艱，以少出門少利用火車爲宜。使鐵路交通，完全爲戰爭與國策事業而服務</p>

<p>柏林二十三日中央社電德軍當局二十二日會見記者時，說明東綫戰况如下：德蘇兩軍現正以合計約六百個師團從事戰鬥，蘇軍已總動員共最大戰軍集團及其他資材，企圖於此夏委作戰中決定戰局，但除在奧勒爾地區外，餘如中部南部等地，蘇軍攻擊力已見削弱。最近蘇軍戰車損失數目之减少，即蘇軍已不能動員與前相同之戰車數量之證。關於目前戰事重心，是否仍在東綫，抑在西西里一項問題，此間軍界人士答曰，東綫現仍爲戰事之重心。要知今在西西里作戰之軍隊，人數，殊不能與東綫相比擬，西西里或可視爲義大利或歐洲之前哨，即使協約軍能征服西西里，對義大利或歐洲仍未能取得戰爭上之決定地位。</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電據海通社訊：最近一期「德國雜誌」載有殷霍夫自東綫中路寄出之一文，其內容略　：東綫第七次夏季戰爭，今已進入新階段，其顯著特徵即爲蘇方調集重兵與物資，企圖使戰事有所決定。但德軍在貝爾格洛特，奥勒爾區之反攻，已予蘇軍囘擊。該處蘇軍的有二百聯隊。兵力在一旅以上，皆爲機械化之精銳部隊，今則已受吾軍之牽制，同時德軍之進攻，亦已迫使蘇軍分散其兵力。此次戰事。蘇軍之「坦克車恐怖」今已失其效用，此項「恐怖」坦克車及美國之「將軍」坦克車，本欲以突擊姿　擊潰德軍，其威力最初確屬驚人、但今則已爲德國對付坦克車之新武器所制服。德軍利用此項新軍器，展開陣地進攻，已獲突破敵陣，且在貝爾格洛特方面今時可發現敵軍被吾擊毀之巨型坦克車，聚集於一處者每有六十輛之多，此並非德國「虎型」坦克車所奏之功，乃德軍二三士兵組成之「坦克車陷陣」所擊毀云。</p>

<p>南北兩路蘇軍同時發動反攻</p>
<p>柏林二十三日電海通社訊，據德軍界人士稱：蘇軍自庫彭橋頭堡以至列寗格勒，發動不惜代價之攻勢，規模之大，爲東戰塲前所未見。</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　據昨晚消息：蘇軍於昨日展開始向列寗格勒外圍之東部攻擊，已展開激烈戰鬥。德國軍事方而認爲此舉，又係目有牽制作用，據云，德軍指揮部對於蘇軍之攻擊列寗格勒區已　覺其從事此項攻擊準備，德軍指揮部對此項新發展，將如何應付，在數B內即可分曉。同時德軍在奥勒爾區，業已開始有力之反攻，並已克復重要陣地。東綫他處之蘇軍集中進攻，已有零亂之狀。蘇軍在苗斯河及唐納資中部，因人力物力受創甚重，故已不能沿全綫作大規模攻擊。</p>
<p>大戰歷十八日蘇軍缺點暴露</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　海通社軍事訪員稱：東綫之夏季大戰中，蘇軍集中進攻，並無戰果，僅削弱其戰鬥力而已。奥勒爾區城戰事仍異常劇烈，蘇軍企圖自四北及西南，以鉗形戰略，突破德軍陣地，或對德軍之北翼與東異作正面之進攻，敵軍作重大之犧牲後，雖略有進展。而德軍防務甚爲鞏固，蘇軍企圖切斷奥勒南至勃里昻斯克之鐵路迄未獲逞。敵軍以大軍在貝爾格洛特以北進攻，亦遭慘敗，唐納資河中部伊齊姆區域，仍爲戰事之重心，德軍反攻，在南岸已獲立足點，並在繼續進展中，蘇軍對苗斯河方面之壓力，業已减退，夏季戰事已歷十八日，目前檢討蘇軍兵器之性質及戰事之新發展，頗有意義。蘇軍以鉅額之飛機參加夏季大戰，但作戰時已顯示蘇聯空軍人員缺乏訓練與經騐，蘇機亦係匆促製成，蘇軍步兵亦缺乏訓練，已不能與一九四二年之蘇軍相此擬，蘇軍步兵包括老年與幼年之士兵，戰鬥力業已削弱。但蘇軍之砲隊，在數量輿質量上均甚優越，蘇軍當局於戰事沉寂時期，顯已準備强大之坦克車部隊，作爲夏季大攻勢之骨幹，蘇軍坦克車隊雖已遭受損失，但蘇聯空軍與步兵旣冶上述之缺點，則坦克車隊與砲隊，仍將爲敵軍之主要兵器，有可斷言。然德軍司令部已瞭解此項情勢，將運用各種兵器，對抗蘇軍之坦克車與砲隊。</p>

<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　海通社錄自艾森霍華將軍之司令部在阿爾及爾所發表之布告稱：美軍已佔領西西里島首邑巴勒馬（Palermo）</p>
<p>柏林廿三日中央社電　據海通社訉：此間獲悉英美現在西西里之兵力共有十一師，最初數日在該島登陸者的九師，其後續有二師在該島上岸，卽此一端亦足證明軸心軍防禦成功，抵抗力之强。德義軍隊並能隨機應變，避免在敵軍有利情形之下與之交戰，因此協約軍屢受頓挫，軸心軍今已佈就有利陣地，足以左右戰事之全局，該島最近數日戰事趨於鬆弛，乃屬暫時性質。據德方觀察，協約軍現正在整理部隊調集生力軍，今在該島之十一師中，六師乃英美軍隊，軸心軍現在西西里西部所採取者，乃一種「彈性防禦戰略」，在東部所採取之戰略，則志在消耗敵軍之戰鬥力，枯竭其供應物資。</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　據德國新聞社消息：西西里島之戰况如次：蒙高茂萊所部英第八軍及潘頓所部美第七軍，刻似正增調預備兵，整備戰綫待機出觔中，廿二日西西里島之戰事頗屬平靜，但此當爲暫時之現象，同時德軍增援部隊亦絡續經由墨西拿海峽開往西西里島。目前自西西里島中部迄喀太尼亞東南岸第一綫之情况殆無變化，軸心軍正死守喀太尼亞低地之北部一帶，此外西部之軸心軍爲避免美軍之兜剿包圍，已自愛那撤退，堅守北方及西北方山岳地帶之陣地。</p>
<p>柏材二十三日中央社電　據海通社訪員塞托里斯稱：昨日午前，西西里戰局絕少變化，英第八軍在喀太尼亞以南企圖波河，業已失敗，敵軍企圖在此項河流之北岸建立橋頭堡，亦未成功，英軍於前日進行此項戰事，損失坦克車不下十三輛，英第八軍左翼在傑姆比尼方面進攻，亦未獲逞。蒙特高茂萊將軍似正採取在北非作戰時之戰略，企圖集中砲隊轟擊，此項計劃顯然頗感困雖，因砲隊所需彈藥尚未遝抵西西里，而必須自突尼西亞運來。</p>

<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　美國自七月一日起之新會計年度中，歲出預算總額預料將達一千零九十億美元，冀中的百分之九十二强，即一千億元爲軍事費，其餘九十億則爲其他費用。但因羅斯福於本月一日及上月下旬，已分別批准七百十五億元之陸軍預算案，與三百二十五億餘元之　軍預算案，因此已較一千億元之軍事費，越過達四十餘億元。又非軍事費一項，除上述之九十億元外，尚有的四十億元，故亦將達一百三寸億元。因此衆料美國在一九四三至一九四四年度之歲出總額，將達一千一百七十億元以上。美政府爲應付此項龐大軍事費，勢將强制改編美國之國民經濟，减少消費品之洪給量，但惡性通貨膨脹之危機，乃益無法避免。</p>

<p>日本經濟使節團一行完畢其重要日程，於十五日自京返滬，此行爲期雖不足十日，但述日與中國政洽經濟界要人會談，獲效頗宏，在具體的推進今後之經濟協力上，頗致期待。</p>
<p>先就中國對使節團訪問上海之反響而言，僉以此次使節團自小倉正恒氏團長以次，集日本財界之第一流　物，且均具有滿腔懇摯之中日提携的誠意而來滬，故對之頗表好感。綜合華方反響，有如决幾點：</p>
<p>政界　東條首相曾聲述改訂中日基本條約，以加張中日合作。但中國政界尚未明瞭其具體方向，使節團一行適於此際來訪，恰予此方向以一具體輪廳，印象頗爲深刻。</p>
<p>經濟界　似此次網羅第一流　物組織經濟團前來訪問，實爲中國事變以來之初次。且對其與中國財界有力者作個別懇談，均感得日方之誠意。並經由使節團而使日本得以明瞭參戰後之物價，通貨狀况，視爲頗有宏效。同時，並指出華方之有力經濟人中，迄今猶有未悉日本之經濟情形者，對此等人經個人的懇談後使之理解，並修正對日觀念，在此點上亦有鉅大效果。</p>
<p>因此，爲促進中日提携，應由中國有力經濟人組織訪日使節團之聲，在華方亦已有人提議，頗堪注意。</p>
<p>隨日本對華新政策之展開。中國人之自主的經濟活動之分野，大見擴展，但彼等所遭遇之困難，亦決不在少。反映財界奥論之申報，在歡迎使節團之社評中。提出目前中國所遭遇之物價，糧食，增强生產，物資交流，通貨等諸問題，並稱：</p>
<p>「一切經濟問題，中國本身自應極力奮鬥，同時，方邦亦必須予以積極的幫助。」</p>
<p>此意亦即爲國府並經濟人之切實意見。此决使節團之主要任務，厥爲轉達從華方所聞之實情與希望，因而使日本之指導的經濟人更加深其對華認識。即就此點而言，可謂已收宏效</p>
<p>小　團長在南京率直承認「物價問題，通貨問題，振興工業問題等，在東京所思考者，與實地考察所見，截然不同」。又稱：「中國方而希望日本經濟界對中國眞相有深切之認識，一知半解之中國觀反阻害中日之提携」。是以小倉團長對中國實情已有深切理解。</p>
<p>使節團如何携回在華中之收獲至束京而實現其具體效果，自爲今後之重要問題。至於今後之對策，使節團一行曾稱：「經濟問題之解決，必須分別爲應急的與恒久的對策二種，是以問題中心在於物價與通貨」。物價問題爲當地最爲一般人關心之大事，中國方面對此亦期待最深。但物價問題不僅爲農工業生產物資流通之物的方面，而且亦是通貨方面的問題，通貨問題在中國特別有重大作用。在戰爭經濟上，通貨膨脹曾爲必然，但在中國，其收回通貨之能力與日本大有差異，其基本原因恰明石如照男氏所稱：「近代經濟機構在中國尚未成立，」除此種基本問題之解決以外，應急的對策允有必要。此在金融方而應極力吸收存款，並以之投放於農業，工業方面。因此，中日亦有加緊合作之必要。</p>
<p>至於收買物資方面，應訂定適當之收買價格，以促進農業之再生產，並保持所收買之物資，以之作爲原料而振興上海工業，此爲建設參戰經濟之根本要着。中日合作應對此方面特別加以注意，此舉如獲成功，即爲安定通貨之基礎。（翔：譯自七月十八日西部每日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c28">日軍發言人談日美攻防戰 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>日陸軍報道部發言人於二十三日會見中國記者團時，就美國對日反攻作戰之真相，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>今夏以來，南太平洋方面之日美攻防戰再趨激烈，自所羅門擊島中央部至新幾內亞之　　亞，長約一千一百公里，成爲日美戰之新第一綫，雙方陸海空三位一體之攻防戰，日見猛烈，敵美澳軍因日軍勇猛果敢之反擊，蒙受極大損害，美軍之此次反攻作戰，在對內方面，或反軸心國間之結合强化等要求上，誠係不得已之反擊戰，然美澳軍之此種反攻，毋寗謂爲日本軍所求之不得者，觀於敵軍每次反攻日大本營所發表之煊赫戰果，即可明瞭，我人由美軍此次反攻，可知敵國方面極多矛盾，但最近突然作一百八十度之轉變，竟發表對日反攻樂觀論，開始演變爲威嚇宣傳，更可發笑者，即澳洲渝方等亦與美國宣傳。同一步調，立即轉向至樂觀論等，均爲其主要者。其第一理由乃華府會議當初，羅斯福因自身希望採取歐洲第一主義，故曾企圖誘導與論傾向至該方面，結果其國內因堅持太平洋作戰第一主義論者亦頗不乏人，故最後折中爲東西同時作戰，美國之軍事領袖，深以此舉所予國內外之反響爲處，同時乘阿茲島反攻機會，乃决意採取此種轉變態度。第二（甲）日本軍南洋占領地復興建設發展極爲迅速，反之，美國軍需生產因煤礦罷工等原因，本年實已由其最高點轉而向下認爲長期戰實屬不利，乃急於進行對日决战。（乙）華府會議結果，决定宣佈太平洋作戰亦於同時進行，乃將對日反攻及戰果加以誇大宣傳，以便對明秋之大總統選舉戰作政略上利用。（丙）將日本軍牽制於南太平洋方面，以便乘隙在中國方面鞏固地盤，使成爲對日反攻基地，此種島嶼反攻，在反軸心方面是否果能收獲實益，據美軍當局辯稱「此次之反攻作戰，决非島嶼反攻，乃以獲得進行反攻之軍事據點爲目標，然後新嘉坡與東京間之連絡綫乃得截斷」。其次乃利用中國大陸作爲對日反攻基地，美國業已遭遇多數困難，即一，目下渝方僅餘之中印西北兩公路輸送力極爲貧弱。二，既無法由日本軍奪取大陸制空槽，則尚進基地之確立，自不可能，爲空襲日本本土起見，首有在中國大陸進行日美空軍决戰之必要，三，爲培養戰力起見，有重開緬甸公路必要，然緬甸公路之重開，以緬甸總反攻爲前提。四，以在渝美空軍之現勢力而觀，實無法進行對日决戰，在渝美空軍雖有與渝方空軍互相合作必要，然爲求指探系統合理起見，乃將渝方空軍置於美第十四航空隊之指揮下，惟蔣主張地位對等。無法直接協力渝軍地上作戰。</p>
<p>綜合以上情形而觀·則美軍之對日反攻，究係根據如何理由，及其實體如何·當可知其梗概矣·更就渝方而言·最近日本實施對華真政策交還租界撤廢治外法權，固不代言，即對國府之自主獨立·亦積極予以協力·故最近渝方對於此點·亦真誠加以檢討，渝方所苦應者，即抗戰名目業已因此喪失，又英美對渝方　意如何，此觀於美國內所謂以人種差別爲目的移民法，至今仍未撤廢或修正，即可推知，又渝方對於國府軍之强化，尤爲關心，茲有一極興趣之問題，即英美人對渝方態度及渝軍之抗戰力所貢獻於此次反軸心戰之價値批評，渝方自認自身之對日抗戰乃爲反軸心戰之先鋒，評價極高，然最近英國格勒普奧論調查委員會曾以「何一反軸心國家對作戰勝利最有貢獻」爲題，經在英美兩國調查結果，英國方面之調查，則以蘇聯爲第一者，計百分之五十，英國爲第一者百分之四十二，渝方百分之五，美國百分之三，又美國方面之調查，則美國爲百分之五十五，蘇聯百分之三十二，英國百分之九，渝方百分之五，英美兩國以渝方貢獻爲第一者均僅百分之五，及百分之四，此可顯示英美對渝方關心之一斑，渝方宜應加以反省也。</p>

<p>日本大使館上海事務所發言人廣田情報部長於昨（二十三）日下午三時向中國新聞記者團發表談話。</p>
<p>揭破陰謀</p>
<p>廣都部長謂，關於歐洲戰區四四里島戰况、各報莫不刊戰正確消息，然英美兩國竟利用此施展政治外交上之伎倆，以是我人不得不對此問題，以揭破英美之陰謀，而喚起諸君特別注意，英國方面掩飾手段之巧妙果在何處，我人茲指出如下，第一爲抹煞波蘭政府第二爲乘勢實行取消大四洋憲章，德波開戰後二個月後，波蘭即爲德所敗，波政府竟流亡英倫，嗣後英爲援助波蘭起見，對德國展開大規模宣傳，而於一九四〇年八月，美總統羅斯福與英首相邱吉爾在大西洋會見，發表大西洋憲章，內容爲保障各小國自由生存，主權獨立完整，同時不變更各小國領土。</p>
<p>波民期望</p>
<p>波蘭國人民竟按照大西洋憲章之發表而亡命倫敦之波政府首相薛哥爾邁斯基遂亦樹立亡命政府於英倫。並於一九四一年在蘇聯領土內，以波蘭之俘虜組成波蘭軍隊，開赴伊郎參加反軸心集團，但其後英美乘機巧取蘇聯歡心，更努力對蘇聯之維緊，一九四二年五月，蘇外長莫洛托夫曾分赴倫敦華盛頓與英美最高當局會商援蘇方針，除要求大量供給蘇聯軍火外，並要求在歐洲開　第一戰綫，然二年來英美不能實踐，蘇聯即有脫離反軸心表示，美英因不惜爲之緩和蘇聯，在北非卡薩白朗加會議時，承認蘇聯在歐洲擴充領土要權，嗣後於本年二月杪，蘇聯竟發生萬人塚慘絕人寰之血案，自該案發生後，波闌亡命政府即對蘇大爲不滿。</p>
<p>抹煞波蘭</p>
<p>本月四日英政府遂利用北非突尼西亞之佔據爲最高潮，但對英政府將波蘭亡命政府移往開羅認爲無注意之必要，此外於六月間與季勞在北非培養實力，時英政府即着波亡命政府首相薛哥爾邁斯基來英倫，不幸薛氏在開羅赴倫敦途中，所乘飛機忽吿失事殞命，薛氏之慘死使英國前此對付其他各國之暗殺案件更爲明顯。</p>
<p>犧牲小國</p>
<p>今波蘭流亡政府業已被抹煞，且進而抹煞芬蘭，羅馬尼亞等小國，遂有自行否定英美所締結之大西洋憲章之事實，七月十三日，英首相邱吉爾在議會提出此問題時，竟謂「爲大國存亡，對小國領土可不必予以考慮」，副首相阿特里更明白表示「大西洋憲章條文，不能保障小國領土」，其內容曲折，及巧妙掩飾英犯罪行爲，殊與偵探小說無異。我人不得不特別喚起注意下列二點：（一）英美雙方取消大西洋憲章，藉以脫離大西洋憲章之約束，（二）英美爲謀本身利益，犧牲小國，更不惜用種種犯罪行爲，暗殺小國巨頭人物。</p>

<h3 id="c57">物價與節約 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 朱承雄</p>
<p>我國向來是個以農立國的國家，所以工業並不發達，在戰前，一切工業產品大都仰給於英美，自大東亞戰爭發生后，航運中斷，輸入停頓，物資的缺乏，自屬意中事，再加一般商人祗圖暴利，不顧民生，從事投機囤積。因爲有了這兩個原因，物價才如脫綫之紙鳶，扶搖直上。本來，在戰爭期間，一切生產機構，因受戰爭動員的影響，其生產率必然的降低，生產量的减少，自然要影響到物價的上漲，所以在戰時，無論那個國家都不能避免物價的高漲。即號稱金元之國的美國，亦屬難免，而我國因有前述的兩個原因，所以表現得更爲顯著。</p>
<p>促使物價高漲的另外一個原因，就是消費的不加限制。這現象在一般大都市—尤其是上海更爲普遍，奢侈糜費，揮霍無度的結果，一方面因物資浪費過鉅而促使物價上昇，一方面則造成驕奢淫佚的風氣而削弱戰爭力量，是以過於浪費物资，却是促使物價高漲的主因，所以談到物價問題就不能忽略先從節約着手。</p>
<p>俗諺云：「勤儉興家，逸豫亡身，」所謂勤，就是積極的增加生產；所謂儉，就是節約。可見勤儉二字是有聯帶關係的。若是勤而不儉，或儉而不勤，還是無濟於事。所以單談節約尙嫌不夠，必須還要積極的增加生產，兩者互相配合，才能收事半功倍之效。</p>
<p>節約的重要，前人早已說過，絕不是現在新創的名詞，不過現在的人，習于奢靡，酖于安樂，早把這种美德，置諸腦後，忘記得乾乾淨淨了。</p>
<p>在國家承平時代，人民若不講求節約，小而言之，必使個人經濟陷于困境，大而言之，足使整個國民經濟瀕於破產。在戰爭時期，人民若猶不覺悟，徒以驕縱奢靡爲樂，浪費物資爲快，則其後果，當更不堪設想，所以友邦日本人民現時的日常生活，早在政府指導督促之下，完成戰時體制，而人民本身更能自我警覺，服從實踐。將一切人力物力供獻于國家，反觀我國，雖蔘戰已逾半載，一部分人民之生活，荒樂如故，消費如故，如此而欲求戰爭勝利，豈可得乎。</p>
<p>假使人人能節省物力，愛惜物資，則物價高漲之困厄，或可得以解除，個人生活，亦可由此而略爲安定，國家之經濟力量，當亦可增加，上海新聞聯合會鑒於節約運動之需要殷切，特爲倡導。其所規定辦法，簡單扼要，易於推行。行見社會風氣，將爲之一變，深望此運動由上海一隅而推及全國各地；并盼政府長官以身作則，爲民表率，如此上行下效，方能卒底於成，不致蹈其他運動之覆轍也。</p>

<p>據姆姆們說，以前該院刺繡作品，傳　世界，獲得羅馬成績展覽會獎憑，國外定貨多至無法應付。其餘各部，亦以各界需要，工人增多至六七百人，對於孤貧女子确爲一大生計，可惜近來受戰事影響，國外定貨已絕，而國內需要亦見銳减，現有女工，大部爲該院已嫁孤女，因爲院內工資已無法維持院外女工的生活。但據記者詢問女工，則稱她們寗願少得些報酬，在院工作，不願拼命去販米或進一般工廠，因爲聖母院的工塲是家庭一般和睦安靜，她們所得到的無價的精神上的酬谢！附設的託兒所，專收女工的子女，早晨帶來，下工帶囘，在所裏另有職員將護一切，使母親無須掛心。現在几家工廠能有這種合不道的設備呢？</p>

<p>徐家匯聖母院育嬰堂在大姆姆步絨賢主持之下，實際工作者有修女金姆姆李姆姆等七十餘人，包括法，義，英，美，各國人，Ｓｉｓｔｅｒ們則專力於院內工作，她們對於孤嬰，不只是消極的收容，更注力於積極的敎養，不只如世間一般父母之徒知溺愛其子女之軀體，本其宗敎的超越觀念，使孤兒在精神學業道德各方面，都能得到眞善的灌漑。對於保健方面還特設完善的病房，由富有醫藥知識的姆姆管理，並有名醫自願義務診治，遇有危險急病，則送至廣慈醫院診治。所以孤女一入該院，修女們就視爲自己的女兒，爲其計劃及保障終身的幸福。修女們雖有國籍之分，但在同一犧牲服務的目標之下，互愛互助，欣勤合作不取絲毫物質的報酬，各處捐入款項，無一滴不用在孤嬰身上，與修女們本身的開支完全劃分，尤爲難能可貴。</p>
<h3 id="c60">迫急的危機 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>孤女天堂，眞能這樣順利地存在嗎？不能！時局與物價的浪潮，早已在襲擊這個天堂而快使陷入全部沉淪的危機，從前，該院的經費，大多數由法國慈善家捐助，本身並無基金及積蓄，歐戰以後，國外捐款斷絕，而物價日漲，開支日增，嬰兒們因爲營養不足而日漸瘦弱。到去年底，几達不能維持之境，成羣的鴿子，出賣了成羣的兔子，出賣了，連僅有的補充生計的奶牛，也一隻隻揮淚離院，孤女的天堂，也臨於末日了。幸而在本年新春，申請上海市貧病救濟協會補助，經委員紀振綱先生前往調査，認爲非急加補助不可，結果該院獲得兩次補助總數達十二萬元，才算奪囘了幾百個垂危的孤兒的生命。可是，在此物價暴漲漫無止境之時，單只維持五百餘名孤嬰的膳食，每月就需米達六十石以上，來源尙未確定，無怪修女姆姆們要訴苦說「我們都是出家求道的人，那裏來這批鉅款維持這七十四年來繼承不絕的事業呢？但是，這些孤女們已見棄於父母，怎忍再看她們見絕於人羣？」該院的光榮與輝煌的成績，使令驚嘆欽佩，功在社會國家，尤不能以數字估計，該院目前存亡的危機，實已不間毫髮，社會上不乏明達好善之士，尤當爲善爭先，同時，我們更希望該院工塲的出品能爲社會所共賞，在各方援助之下，力求業務之改善與髮展，也可開闢一條生路。我們要使今日修女們與孤女們的愛心之淚，在不久的將來化爲人類博愛之光？</p>

<h3 id="c61">急待改善的　鐵路行旅問題 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>近來我人對於鐵路行旅，每苦其手續之麻煩，而一般旅客亦對此視爲畏途。前以旅客排隊入站問題弊端叢生，頗引起社會人士的注意。自經輿論呼籲後，鐵路當局即對入站手續加以改善，便利旅客，未可言鮮。但除此以外如購票，檢査，排隊，登車等事項，更有意外的種種困難，而在近日間尤爲加甚。</p>
<p>由於最近半月中鐵路當局實施限制旅客人數後，旅客往來尤感不便，蓋當局鑒於近來氣候炎熱，爲避免車中人數過於擁擠與傳染疫症起見，故有此種種措施，在日本歐洲各國，均有前例，但在我國，則結果反造成行旅上的種種不便。</p>
<p>滬站爲連貫京滬、滬杭兩路的交點，出入旅客每日何止數千，站中擁擠情形以此爲最，有旣購票而不能進站者，亦有等候二三天而未得登車者，此端不特直接影響急於返鄉之平民生計，且因公務而來往之旅客，亦遭受同樣的阻碍，此其一。蘇州居江蘇省會之地，每日來往滬地旅客特多，該地近日對於來滬旅客，亦有規定，其每日發售上海車票，雖有限制，然所售出者尙不足規定額數，自大體言，每日發售三等車票僅數百張，且其手續較以前更多麻煩，因此狂抬車價，造成黑市車價之怪現象。按蘇州至上海三等車價爲十三元一角，其黑市價格竟達五六十元不等，此其二。鐵路警備原爲保護路綫與旅客的安全而設，今之鐵路警員竟憑其職務上的權力，濫施檢査，任意凌辱，此其三。物資統制爲戰時國家的重要政策，但一般無知商販假鐵路以販運統制物品，藉取厚利，自應取締。此蜚單幫商販往來鐵路綫上，其人數竟超過普通之旅客，故使普通旅客在車中反無立足之地，此其四。</p>
<p>基於上述四端，我人可知鐵路行旅之困難。其改進方法：在積極方面，爲避免目前旅客擁擠起見，最好能於可能範圍內增加列車次數；近日由滬站增駛之區間臨時列車，在京滬綫者已由一次增至三四次，是爲顯例。但京滬快車每日僅有二次，照目前情形，似有增加之必要，車次旣多，自無擠車之現象，但車輛之支配與燃料等問題，亦當詳爲考慮者也。在消極方面，一方面固應嚴予取締鐵路商販。另一方面並盼人民自行節約，盡量减少旅行的次數。</p>
<p>觀乎鐵路爲國家交通命脈，京滬各爲全國政治經濟的中心，京滬，滬杭兩綫實具有地理上的重要價值。所以鐵路行旅之頻繁，也是一種普遍的現象，而行旅上的種種問題，自須謀適當的解決，今姑提出數點：（一）調整乘車手續。（二）改善檢査制度。（三）取締鐵路商販。（四）調劑搭客與列車。以上四端，均爲目前急切之問題，深盼鐵路當局有以採納，則改善交通造福人民，利莫大焉。（盧晚移）</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>上次車站能開放正門，旅客不受擠軋之苦者，皆蓋輿論促成，嘉惠行旅，實非淺鮮。乃邇來兩路各埠車站，對於出售車票限制棊嚴，僅以極少數之車票，供給旅客，致造成超過原票價數倍以上之黑市車票，而此項黑市車票，大多來自一般販夫走卒之徒，在車站附近兜售，爭先恐後，秩序大亂，似此情形迭失管理交通之道，而往返於京滬滬杭兩路之旅客，尤感痛苦，如遇有緊要之事，更爲車票作梗，而不能準時登車，時間經濟兩有損失，亟盼當局注意改善。（方正毅）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Urgent Need for Improvement in Railway Transportation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The railway transportation between Shanghai and Nanjing, and between Shanghai and Hangzhou, is the major artery of the national economy in Central China, possessing the most important significance in all aspects of nationwide material exchange. Therefore, all insightful people understand that to revitalize all industries in Central China, it is crucial to first develop the transportation enterprises of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Conversely, if problems arise in the transportation of these two lines, it will immediately affect the economy and the people's livelihood of Shanghai, Central China, and even the whole country. Not long ago, due to the Shanghai Railway Station's inadequate handling of passengers, affecting the travel on both lines, this newspaper, with the common feeling of the citizens, requested improvements. We were deeply grateful for the attention of the authorities concerned, who once made improvements, benefiting travelers. The virtue of the Central China Railway authorities in readily accepting good advice was highly admired by all sectors. However, not long after, even more serious adverse phenomena have occurred in the transportation and travel on both lines, which is beyond our expectation.</p>
<p>Summarizing the recent letters from readers: the major inconveniences for travelers on both lines are as follows: (1) Tickets for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines are difficult to obtain, often requiring waiting for two or three days or more. This situation is truly rare. Because tickets are hard to get, a black market has emerged. (2) Passengers on the above two lines, even after purchasing tickets, cannot board immediately and often have to wait for two or three days. This results in wasted time, money, and energy. (3) The number of passenger tickets issued on the above two lines is too limited. For example, the quota for third-class tickets from Suzhou to Shanghai is several hundred, but in reality, only a fraction of this quota can be purchased at the station. (4) The procedures for purchasing tickets, entering the station, and boarding the train are still too cumbersome, wasting too much time, which goes against the true meaning of wartime efficiency. The waste of time and manpower is equivalent to the waste of money and materials. (5) A small number of railway staff and railway police officers have attitudes and service ethics towards passengers that provoke resentment among some travelers. A particularly serious strange phenomenon is (6), the proliferation of so-called "small-scale merchants" on all trains on both lines. The sources of their tickets and the materials they trade, which may violate control regulations, are not simple problems. All these most important adverse phenomena on both lines have a great impact and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Regarding the reasons for the various phenomena currently occurring on the aforementioned two lines, we outsiders naturally cannot speculate arbitrarily. We hope that the Central China Railway authorities will conduct a thorough review and study with the candid attitude of the past. Based on the facts, we hope that the following points can be improved in the near future. On the positive side: (1) In order to develop the economy of Central China, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines must find ways to increase the number of vehicles and train schedules. They should also find ways to adjust the schedules of passenger and freight trains to make them appropriate. Recently, the number of train schedules between Beijing and Shanghai has increased, but it has not actually benefited legitimate passengers. In the future, a better method should be devised to reduce the overcrowding of passenger trains. (2) Improve the procedures for issuing tickets and boarding trains so that legitimate passengers can purchase tickets at the station in a timely manner and board the train promptly, avoiding wasting time, money, and energy before purchasing tickets and boarding the train. Boarding procedures and rules should be simple and clear, so that everyone can easily understand and comply. On the negative side: (1) Black market trading of tickets should be eliminated with the greatest determination. (2) Improve the inspection methods for passengers and their luggage, specify inspection rules, times, and inspectors, and minimize the number and duration of inspections as much as possible. (3) Strictly crack down on small-scale merchants, in order to benefit general legitimate passengers. In fact, almost half of the vehicles on both lines currently serve these small-scale merchants. After cracking down on them, smuggling can be stopped, and the excessive price difference between Shanghai and the interior can be eliminated. This will also greatly help the legitimate revenue of the railway.</p>
<p>Precisely because the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines are the major arteries related to the national economy and material exchange of Central China and the whole country, efforts must be made to improve them, and no abnormal phenomena can be allowed to exist. Although it is temporarily impossible to compete with the Japanese railway management, at least the situation of the lines before the incident should be restored. To this end, we sincerely hope that the parties concerned will pay attention and absorb Chinese and Japanese expert talent to engage in research and improvement work. At the same time, for railway employees, from senior staff to porters, and railway security personnel, conduct rectification and education, improve and guarantee their lives, raise their service ethics, and eliminate disrespectful and improper attitudes towards legitimate passengers. In addition to this, we also hope for two points from all sectors: First, we hope that the parties concerned and the business community will cooperate to improve and develop transportation auxiliary to the railway, especially inland river water transportation, increasing wooden boats and small motorized transport ships to reduce the burden on trains. Second, we hope that all sectors of society, unless absolutely necessary, will share the difficulties and reduce going out and using trains. This will allow railway transportation to fully serve the war and national policy.</p>

<p>Speeches from Both Sides</p>
<p>Ambassador Dai said in his speech that the Italian Fascist government is fulfilling its determination to renounce all privileges in China, as announced on January 11th. After returning the administrative power of the Dongjiaominxiang in Peiping, it is now implementing the reception of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement, which is also a confirmation of its sympathy and friendship for China. The Italian government is pleased to be able to follow its ally Japan again in assisting China in this unprecedented historical transformation, so that it can advance in the great cause of building a co-prosperity sphere. Minister Chu replied that he was very honored to sign the agreement on the return of the Shanghai International Settlement with the Ambassador today. On behalf of the National Government of the Republic of China, I would like to express my gratitude to the Italian government. Ambassador Dai Liangyi has always made efforts to assist in this matter in accordance with the statement of his government on January 11th, which is very gratifying. Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of China. For a hundred years, it has been bound by unequal treaties, and it is deeply regrettable that the Chinese government has not been able to fully exercise its power. Fortunately, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have been completely eliminated by our ally Japan. In addition, the friendly country of Italy, which first implemented the return, has also signed an agreement with our country today to return the Shanghai International Settlement, creating one of the brightest pages in the diplomatic history of China and Italy. Its significance is very significant. The Chinese government and people should express their most sincere gratitude. China and Italy have long enjoyed friendly relations, and cultural exchanges have taken place for centuries. I firmly believe that from now on, the relations between the two countries will become even closer, and we will move towards the path of building a new order together, and I cannot help but hold endless hopes.</p>

<p>The Capital Prepares a Celebration Conference</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Our ally Japan has decided to implement the return of the Shanghai International Settlement on August 1st. Italy and France have also abandoned the administrative power of the concessions. From now on, our country will break free from the shackles of Britain and the United States and obtain true freedom of territorial integrity and sovereign independence. The news has been met with extraordinary excitement. It not only stimulates the anti-British and anti-American sentiments of the people, but also strengthens the determination of our country to cooperate and complete the Greater East Asia War. The people of all circles in the capital have specifically scheduled to hold a celebration conference on August 1st at 3:00 pm in the National Assembly Hall to celebrate the return of the Shanghai International Settlement and to defeat the British and American capital people's conference. After the conference, there will be a demonstration parade to show that the entire nation, under the leadership of the supreme leader, is working together to strive and fulfill the great mission of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time. (Another report) The Propaganda Department has decided that the people of the capital will hold a celebration conference at 3:00 pm on August 1st in the National Assembly Hall to celebrate the return of the concessions by friendly countries. In order to guide all the necessary matters for the conference, the department has specifically scheduled to convene a liaison meeting at 3:00 pm on the 24th in the Tokyo Hall of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association to gather all units participating in the conference to discuss the conference proceedings.</p>
<p>Saigon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The 400,000 overseas Chinese in southern Vietnam were deeply delighted to learn that China and France had signed an agreement to receive the Shanghai French Concession. It has now been decided to hold a conference of all sectors of the overseas Chinese in southern Vietnam in Dike on August 1st to celebrate the return of the French Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Words "Concession" <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - After France returned the administrative power of the Shanghai Concession, Italy was the only country with administrative power in Shanghai. Now that Italy has returned the administrative power of the Shanghai Concession, the administration of the Greater Shanghai Municipality has returned to unity. From now on, it can develop freely to create our country's true first major economic metropolis and seek the normal development of various departments of the national economy and culture. Since Italy has abandoned the administrative power in the Shanghai Concession, the Italian Concession in Tianjin will also be returned to our country in the near future. After the Italian Concession in Tianjin is returned, there will be no concessions in China, and the purpose of territorial integrity and sovereign independence will be achieved. The words "concession" should also become a historical term. The status of a quasi-colony for a hundred years will be broken away once and for all, and the purpose sought by the revolution for decades will also be realized once and for all. What could be more pleasant than this? With the return and abandonment of the special concessions and administrative power of various countries in Shanghai, China can achieve the goal of restoring China through the unification of the administrative power of Greater Shanghai, and the victory of the Axis countries should also take this as an opportunity to complete the construction of a new world order.</p>

Recently, the economic poverty of the Chongqing side is beyond words. Riots have frequently occurred in various places and are expanding. In addition, the Japanese government has resolutely expressed its determination to develop southern resources in order to establish a long-term war system, which has dealt a fatal blow to the Chongqing side. Recently, the Chongqing authorities have been constantly crying and begging for assistance from Britain and the United States in order to support the long-term war. In addition, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently become increasingly active, constantly attacking central and southern China in a guerrilla posture. The US Air Force has also emphasized the bombing of Japanese soil and water, but under the strong protection of the Japanese Air Force, there is no need to worry at all, and it is just a bluff.</p>
<p>Qingdao, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Since the 13th of this month, the Japanese army's punitive force has launched a fierce attack on the 4,000 Chongqing Communist troops operating in the territories of Zhucheng and Juxian counties in central Shandong Province.

The Japanese punitive force captured one mortar, 14 shells, five automatic rifles, one Czech machine gun, and a large number of other military supplies.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Eastern Front Summer War Enters New Stage, Forces on Both Sides Reach 600 Divisions, Soviet Tank "Terror" Ineffective <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): The German authorities, meeting with reporters on the 22nd, described the Eastern Front situation as follows: The German and Soviet armies are currently engaged in combat with a combined total of approximately 600 divisions. The Soviet army has mobilized all its largest military groups and other resources, attempting to decide the war in this summer campaign. However, except in the Orel region, the Soviet offensive power has weakened in other areas such as the central and southern regions. The recent decrease in the number of Soviet tank losses is evidence that the Soviet army is no longer able to mobilize the same number of tanks as before. Regarding the question of whether the current focus of the war is still on the Eastern Front or in Sicily, military personnel here replied that the Eastern Front is still the focus of the war. It should be noted that the number of troops fighting in Sicily cannot be compared with that on the Eastern Front. Sicily may be regarded as an outpost of Italy or Europe. Even if the Allied forces conquer Sicily, they will still not be able to achieve a decisive position in the war against Italy or Europe.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to Huitong News Agency, a recent issue of "German Magazine" contains an article by Imhoff from the central sector of the Eastern Front, the content of which is roughly as follows: The seventh summer war on the Eastern Front has now entered a new stage, the most prominent feature of which is the Soviet Union's mobilization of heavy troops and supplies, attempting to make a decisive difference in the war. However, the German counter-offensives in the Belgorod and Orel regions have repulsed the Soviet army. The Soviet forces there have 200 regiments. Units with more than one brigade are all mechanized elite troops, but now they have been contained by our army. At the same time, the German offensive has also forced the Soviet army to disperse its forces. In this battle, the Soviet "tank terror" has now lost its effectiveness. These "terror" tanks and the American "General" tanks were intended to break through the German army with a sudden attack, and their power was indeed astonishing at first. But now they have been subdued by Germany's new weapons for dealing with tanks. The German army has used this new military equipment to launch positional offensives, breaking through enemy lines. In the Belgorod area, it is now possible to find enemy giant tanks destroyed by our forces, often gathered in groups of up to sixty vehicles. This is not due to the German "Tiger" tanks, but to the "tank destroyer" teams composed of two or three German soldiers.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government has twice invited senior statesmen who have served as prime ministers to hold senior statesmen's round table conferences. The third round table conference was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 5 p.m. on the 23rd. The senior statesmen present included Baron Wakatsuki Reijiro, Admiral Okada Keisuke, Baron Hiranuma Kiichiro, Duke Konoe Fumimaro, Admiral Yonai Mitsumasa, Hirota Koki, Admiral Abe Nobuyuki and others seven people, and Privy Council President Hara Yoshimichi. On the Japanese government side were Prime Minister Tojo and relevant cabinet ministers, the four Chief Cabinet Secretaries, etc. First, the government side explained the recent domestic and foreign war situation and the overall international situation, and then discussed various issues and had dinner together until the meeting adjourned at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): The Japanese regular cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10 a.m. on the 23rd. Cabinet ministers including Prime Minister Tojo attended. Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki gave a detailed report on the issue of taxation of Japanese citizens residing in the Republic of China after the implementation of the new policy towards China.</p>
<p>Soviet Forces Launch Counter-Offensives Simultaneously on the Northern and Southern Fronts</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Electric Transmission): According to Huitong News Agency, German military sources say that the Soviet army has launched an offensive from the Kupensk bridgehead to Leningrad at all costs, on a scale unprecedented in the Eastern Theater.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to news last night, the Soviet army launched an attack on the eastern outskirts of Leningrad yesterday, and fierce fighting has broken out. German military authorities believe that this move is also aimed at containment. It is said that the German command has realized that the Soviet army is preparing to attack the Leningrad area. How the German command will respond to this new development will be clear within a few days. At the same time, the German army in the Orel area has begun a powerful counter-offensive and has recaptured important positions. The concentrated attacks of the Soviet army elsewhere on the Eastern Front have become disorganized. The Soviet army in the Mius River and the central Donets region has suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources, so it has been unable to launch large-scale attacks along the entire line.</p>
<p>Soviet Shortcomings Exposed After 18 Days of War</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): A military correspondent for Huitong News Agency said that in the summer battle on the Eastern Front, the concentrated attacks of the Soviet army have not yielded results, only weakening their combat effectiveness. The fighting in the Orel area is still extremely fierce. The Soviet army is attempting to break through the German lines with a pincer strategy from the northeast and southwest, or to launch frontal attacks on the northern and eastern wings of the German army. After making heavy sacrifices, the enemy has made some slight progress. However, the German defenses are very solid, and the Soviet army's attempt to cut off the railway from Orel to Bryansk has not succeeded. The enemy's attack with a large army north of Belgorod has also been disastrously defeated. The Izyum area in the central Donets region is still the focus of the war. The German counter-offensive has gained a foothold on the south bank and is continuing to advance. The Soviet pressure on the Mius River has decreased. The summer war has lasted for eighteen days. It is now meaningful to review the nature of Soviet weapons and the new developments in the war. The Soviet army has participated in the summer war with a huge number of aircraft, but the operations have shown that Soviet air force personnel lack training and experience, and Soviet aircraft are also hastily manufactured. The Soviet infantry also lacks training and cannot be compared with the Soviet army of 1942. The Soviet infantry includes elderly and young soldiers, and their combat effectiveness has been weakened. However, the Soviet artillery is superior in both quantity and quality. The Soviet authorities apparently prepared a strong tank force during the period of calm in the war as the backbone of the summer offensive. Although the Soviet tank force has suffered losses, if the Soviet air force and infantry have the above-mentioned shortcomings, then the tank force and artillery will still be the enemy's main weapons. It can be asserted. However, the German command has understood this situation and will use various weapons to counter the Soviet tanks and artillery.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Axis Forces in Sicily Establish Favorable Positions, Enemy Fails to Cross River South of Catania, Rumor that Palermo Has Been Occupied by US Forces <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency quoted a bulletin issued by General Eisenhower's headquarters in Algiers as saying that US forces have occupied Palermo, the capital of Sicily.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to Huitong News Agency, it is learned here that the British and American forces in Sicily total eleven divisions. The initial nine divisions landed on the island in the first few days, followed by two divisions landing on the island. This alone is enough to prove the success of the Axis defense and the strength of its resistance. The German and Italian forces have also been able to adapt to the situation and avoid fighting the enemy under favorable conditions. As a result, the Allied forces have repeatedly suffered setbacks. The Axis forces have now established favorable positions sufficient to influence the overall situation of the war. The recent relaxation of the war on the island is temporary in nature. According to German observations, the Allied forces are now reorganizing their troops and mobilizing fresh troops. Of the eleven divisions currently on the island, six are British and American troops. The Axis forces in western Sicily are adopting a "flexible defense strategy," while the strategy in the east aims to deplete the enemy's combat power and exhaust its supplies.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to the German News Agency, the situation in Sicily is as follows: The British Eighth Army under Montgomery and the US Seventh Army under Patton seem to be increasing their reserve troops, preparing their lines and waiting for an opportunity to launch an attack. The war in Sicily was quite calm on the 22nd, but this should be a temporary phenomenon. At the same time, German reinforcements are continuously heading to Sicily via the Strait of Messina. At present, the situation on the front line from central Sicily to the southeast coast of Catania is almost unchanged. The Axis forces are holding the northern area of ​​the Catania lowlands. In addition, the Axis forces in the west have withdrawn from Enna to avoid encirclement by US forces and are holding positions in the mountainous areas to the north and northwest.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to Huitong News Agency reporter Setoris, there was little change in the Sicilian battle situation yesterday morning. The British Eighth Army's attempt to cross the Po River south of Catania has failed. The enemy's attempt to establish a bridgehead on the north bank of this river has also failed. The British army lost no less than thirteen tanks in this battle the day before. The British Eighth Army's attack on the left flank in the Ghemmini area has also failed. General Montgomery seems to be adopting the strategy he used in North Africa, attempting to concentrate artillery bombardment. This plan is obviously quite difficult because the ammunition needed by the artillery has not yet arrived in Sicily and must be transported from Tunisia.</p>

<p>Rome, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to Huitong News Agency, rescue organizations here have sprung up like mushrooms after rain in a very short time and with everyone's enthusiastic participation. The Governor's Office has established a new bureau to handle disaster relief matters, and donations have been received from all over the country. The Fascist Party has established a university graduate relief fund, and part of the donation will help students from Sicily and Sardinia to transfer to other Italian universities. A large number of children displaced by the air raids have been taken care of by the Fascist Party student organizations. Yesterday, the newspapers published the names and photos of the displaced children, because most of these children are under the age of four and can only say their names. A woman working for the Red Cross has not slept for three days and nights in order to find lost children. In addition to political parties, the Church and the Vatican have also established disaster relief organizations. The Vatican's vehicles distribute milk, water, and food, providing 9,000 servings per day.</p>
<h3 id="e22">US New Budget <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency): In the new fiscal year beginning July 1, the total expenditure budget of the United States is expected to reach 109 billion US dollars, of which more than 92 percent, or 100 billion dollars, is for military expenses, and the remaining 9 billion is for other expenses. However, because Roosevelt approved the 71.5 billion yuan army budget and the more than 32.5 billion yuan navy budget on the 1st of this month and in late last month, respectively, it has exceeded the 100 billion yuan military expenditure by more than 4 billion yuan. In addition to the above-mentioned 9 billion yuan, there is also 4 billion yuan for non-military expenses, so it will also reach 13 billion yuan. Therefore, it is expected that the total expenditure of the United States in the 1943 to 1944 fiscal year will reach more than 117 billion yuan. In order to cope with this huge military expenditure, the US government will inevitably forcibly reorganize the US national economy and reduce the supply of consumer goods, but the crisis of malignant inflation will be even more difficult to avoid.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Results of Visits to China by Japanese Economic Envoys: Correcting the Views of Economic Figures on Japan, Cooperating to Deal with China's Price Issues <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese economic delegation completed its important schedule and returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 15th. Although the trip lasted less than ten days, they held talks with leading figures in the political and economic circles of Japan and China, and achieved significant results, which are expected to promote future economic cooperation in a concrete way.</p>
<p>First, regarding China's reaction to the delegation's visit to Shanghai, all believed that this delegation, led by Chairman Masatsune Ogura, was composed of first-class figures in the Japanese financial world, and all came to Shanghai with full sincerity for Sino-Japanese cooperation, so they expressed a good impression of them. Summarizing the Chinese reaction, there are several points:</p>
<p>Political circles: Prime Minister Tojo once stated that he would revise the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty to strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation. However, the Chinese political circles have not yet understood its specific direction. The delegation's visit at this time happened to give this direction a concrete outline, and the impression was quite deep.</p>
<p>Economic circles: It seems that this is the first time since the China Incident that an economic delegation organized by first-class figures has come to visit. They all felt the sincerity of the Japanese side in their individual talks with powerful figures in the Chinese financial world. And through the delegation, Japan was able to understand the price and currency situation after the war, which was regarded as quite effective. At the same time, it was pointed out that among the powerful economic figures in China, there are still those who do not know the economic situation in Japan. After personal talks with these people, they were made to understand and correct their views on Japan, which also had a huge effect in this regard.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, some people in China have also proposed the idea of ​​organizing a delegation of powerful Chinese economic figures to visit Japan, which is quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>With the development of Japan's new policy towards China, the field of independent economic activities of Chinese people has greatly expanded, but the difficulties they encounter are by no means small. The Shen Bao, which reflects the public opinion of the financial world, raised the issues of prices, food, increased production, material exchange, and currency currently encountered by China in its editorial welcoming the delegation, and said:</p>
<p>"China itself should strive to the utmost to solve all economic problems. At the same time, Japan must also provide active assistance."</p>
<p>This is also the practical opinion of the National Government and economic figures. The main task of this delegation was to convey the facts and hopes heard from China, so that the leading economic figures in Japan could deepen their understanding of China. Even from this point of view, it can be said that it has achieved great results.</p>
<p>Chairman Ogura frankly admitted in Nanjing, "The problems of prices, currency, and revitalization of industry are completely different in what is considered in Tokyo and what is seen in actual investigation." He also said: "The Chinese side hopes that the Japanese economic world has a deep understanding of the truth of China, and a half-baked view of China hinders Sino-Japanese cooperation." Therefore, Chairman Ogura already has a deep understanding of the actual situation in China.</p>
<p>How the delegation will bring back the gains made in China to Tokyo and realize its concrete effects is naturally an important issue for the future. As for future countermeasures, the delegation once said: "The solution to economic problems must be divided into two types: emergency and permanent countermeasures. Therefore, the core of the problem lies in prices and currency." The price problem is the most concerning issue for most people locally, and the Chinese side also has the deepest expectations for this. However, the price problem is not only a matter of material aspects such as agricultural and industrial production and material circulation, but also a problem of currency. The currency problem has a particularly important role in China. In wartime economy, inflation has been inevitable, but in China, its ability to recover currency is very different from that of Japan. The basic reason is exactly as Mr. Akira Ishimi said: "Modern economic institutions have not yet been established in China." In addition to the solution of this basic problem, emergency countermeasures are necessary. In the financial aspect, efforts should be made to absorb deposits and invest them in agriculture and industry. Therefore, it is also necessary for China and Japan to strengthen cooperation.</p>
<p>As for the purchase of materials, appropriate purchase prices should be set to promote agricultural reproduction, and the purchased materials should be maintained and used as raw materials to revitalize Shanghai's industry. This is the fundamental key to building a wartime economy. Sino-Japanese cooperation should pay special attention to this aspect. If this is successful, it will be the foundation for stabilizing the currency. (Translated from the Western Daily News, July 18)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Rumor that the Quantity of Exchanged Materials Has Been Determined <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>According to reports, the quantity of exchanged materials between Central China and North China has been determined. As for the restriction of power, it is actually caused by the shortage of coal, resulting in insufficient power. If the power is insufficient, the power required by the factory will be restricted, and the production rate cannot be increased. In order to make up for this shortcoming, a large amount of coal will be transported from various production areas in the future, so that the power distribution can return to normal, and the production of both factories can also be improved. If the above two prerequisites can be completed, and the operation of the factory can be changed, the matter of increasing production can be achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Spokesperson of the Japanese Army Discusses the Japan-U.S. Offensive and Defensive War <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>When the spokesperson of the Japanese Army Press Department met with the Chinese Journalists Association on the 23rd, he delivered a speech on the truth of the U.S. counter-offensive operations against Japan, as follows:</p>
<p>Since this summer, the Japan-U.S. offensive and defensive war in the South Pacific has intensified again. From the central part of the Solomon Islands to New Guinea, a length of about 1,100 kilometers, has become the new front line of the Japan-U.S. war. The three-dimensional offensive and defensive war of land, sea, and air on both sides has become increasingly fierce. Due to the brave and decisive counterattacks of the Japanese army, the enemy U.S. and Australian forces have suffered great losses. This counter-offensive operation of the U.S. military is truly an unavoidable counterattack in terms of internal requirements such as strengthening the alliance between anti-Axis countries. However, this kind of counter-offensive by the U.S. and Australian forces is what the Japanese army has been seeking. This can be clearly understood by looking at the brilliant results of the battles announced by the Japanese headquarters every time the enemy army counterattacks. We can see from this counter-offensive by the U.S. military that there are many contradictions on the enemy's side. However, recently, there has been a sudden 180-degree turn, and they have even published optimistic theories about the counter-offensive against Japan, and have begun to evolve into threatening propaganda. What is even more laughable is that the Australian side has also joined the U.S. propaganda in the same direction, and has immediately turned to optimistic theories, which are all its main aspects. The first reason is that at the beginning of the Washington Conference, Roosevelt attempted to guide the public opinion towards the European side because he himself hoped to adopt the "Europe First" policy. As a result, there were quite a few people in his country who insisted on the "Pacific Theater First" theory. Therefore, the final compromise was to fight on both the Eastern and Western fronts at the same time. The U.S. military leaders were deeply concerned about the domestic and foreign repercussions of this move. At the same time, taking advantage of the opportunity of the counter-offensive on the Az Islands, they decided to adopt this kind of turnaround attitude. Second, (A) the restoration, construction, and development of the Japanese army's occupied territories in the South Pacific are extremely rapid. On the contrary, due to reasons such as coal mine strikes, the U.S. military's production of military supplies this year has actually turned downward from its highest point, and it is considered unfavorable for a long-term war. Therefore, they are anxious to carry out a decisive battle against Japan. (B) As a result of the Washington Conference, it was decided to announce that the Pacific Theater would also be carried out at the same time. Therefore, the counter-offensive against Japan and the results of the war were exaggerated for the purpose of using it strategically for the presidential election battle in the coming autumn. (C) Restraining the Japanese army in the South Pacific in order to take advantage of the opportunity to consolidate its base in China and make it a base for counter-offensive against Japan. Whether this kind of island counter-offensive can actually obtain practical benefits in terms of anti-Axis, the U.S. military authorities claim that "this counter-offensive operation is definitely not an island counter-offensive, but aims to obtain military bases for carrying out a counter-offensive, and then the communication line between Singapore and Tokyo can be cut off." The second is to use the Chinese mainland as a base for counter-offensive against Japan. The United States has already encountered many difficulties, namely: First, at present, the transportation capacity of the only remaining China-India Northwest highways is extremely weak. Second, since it is impossible to seize the continental airspace from the Japanese army, it is impossible to establish a forward base. In order to air raid the Japanese mainland, it is first necessary to conduct a decisive battle between the Japanese and U.S. air forces on the Chinese mainland. Third, in order to cultivate combat power, it is necessary to reopen the Burma Road, but the reopening of the Burma Road is based on the premise of a general counter-offensive in Burma. Fourth, judging from the current strength of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, it is impossible to carry out a decisive battle against Japan. Although the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing needs to cooperate with the Chongqing Air Force, in order to rationalize the command and detection system, the Chongqing Air Force is placed under the command of the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force, but Chiang insists on equal status and cannot directly cooperate with the Chongqing army in ground operations.</p>
<p>Judging from the above situation, the reasons for the U.S. military's counter-offensive against Japan and its reality can be roughly understood. Furthermore, as far as Chongqing is concerned, Japan's recent implementation of the "true policy towards China" to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights, not to mention, also actively cooperates with the independence of the National Government. Therefore, recently Chongqing has also sincerely reviewed this point. What Chongqing is suffering from is that the anti-war name has already been lost because of this. Also, what is the intention of Britain and the United States towards Chongqing? This can be inferred from the fact that the U.S. immigration law, which is aimed at racial discrimination, has not yet been repealed or revised. In addition, Chongqing is particularly concerned about the strengthening of the National Government's army. There is an extremely interesting question, namely the criticism of the British and Americans on the attitude of Chongqing and the value of the contribution of the Chongqing army's anti-war effort to this anti-Axis war. Chongqing believes that its own anti-Japanese war is the vanguard of the anti-Axis war, and its evaluation is extremely high. However, the British Gallup Poll Survey Committee recently conducted a survey in Britain and the United States on the topic of "Which anti-Axis country has contributed the most to the victory of the war?" The survey in Britain showed that the Soviet Union was the first, accounting for 50%, Britain was the first, accounting for 42%, Chongqing was 5%, and the United States was 3%. Also, the survey in the United States showed that the United States was 55%, the Soviet Union was 32%, Britain was 9%, and Chongqing was 5%. Both Britain and the United States considered Chongqing's contribution to be only 5% and 4%, respectively. This shows a glimpse of the British and Americans' concern for Chongqing, and Chongqing should reflect on it.</p>

First, Chairman Huang Xianggu reported, and then passed the dissolution declaration, the respectful telegram, the letter of thanks, and elected Li Gongyan, Guo Shuliang, and Wang Haifan as three committee members to handle the closing. The closing situation will be reported to the competent authorities. The meeting adjourned at about 6 p.m. The declaration and telegram are recorded below:</p>
<p>Dissolution Declaration: The original intention of establishing this association was to cope with the special organization of the concession authorities and to represent the compatriots within the concession in seeking legitimate interests. Since its establishment, through the efforts of successive Chinese directors, Chinese committee members, and executive and supervisory committee members, and with the earnest guidance of the government authorities and the enthusiastic support of the compatriots within the concession, the association's facilities have achieved good results. Now, based on friendly relations, the French government has signed an agreement to return the concession; good news has come, and we are deeply grateful. Since the concession has been recovered, the mission of this association will naturally come to an end. On behalf of the compatriots within the concession, we express our gratitude to the French government and pay our respects and congratulations to our own government. From today onwards, we announce the dissolution. This is the declaration.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Chairman: To Chairman Wang Jingwei of the National Government: For a hundred years, the existence of concessions has created many tragic marks in our country's history. Anglo-American imperialism has served as a base for continuous aggression against our country. Fortunately, with your virtue and the assistance of friendly nations, we have recovered the last remaining Shanghai concessions. From now on, national sovereignty will be restored to its integrity, the people within the concessions will be freed from their shackles, and the people of the whole country will be overjoyed. The original intention of establishing this association was to seek legitimate interests for the compatriots within the concessions. Now that the mission has been completed, we hereby announce the dissolution and send this telegram to pay our respects. Please review it carefully. The Shanghai French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association bows in respect.</p>

<p>1.  "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie the bones of those who have frozen to death" is the crime of the wasteful.</p>

<p>The reader scholarship fund organized by this newspaper aims to help outstanding poor children who are about to drop out of school. Since its establishment, it has been five years. We are deeply moved by the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. Although this year's scholarship has exceeded one million yuan, due to the high cost of tuition and the surge in the number of people waiting for assistance, there is still a sense of "more monks than porridge." We hope that enthusiastic readers will continue to donate to complete the full success of helping students. Yesterday, we received a generous donation of 20,000 yuan from social figure Jin Ji and 5,000 yuan from Mr. Wu Yunzhan. In addition, Mr. Tao Junren and Mr. Lu Longzhi donated two paintings and calligraphy works for charity sale to help students, including one Zheng Banqiao painting and one Lu Lianfu flower painting. It is truly commendable to benefit the poor. Now,</p>
<p>Scholarship Donations Received Yesterday: The list of scholarship donations received by this newspaper yesterday is as follows: Jin Ji 20,000 yuan, Wu Yunzhan 5,000 yuan, Chen Riping 1,000 yuan, Sun Renjing, Zhu Ji, and Lu Yunsheng 500 yuan each, colleagues at No. 4 Maosheng Lane 400 yuan, Zhengtai Qianzhuang and Song Yimin 250 yuan each, Qu Jianxin 200 yuan, Zhu Xieqing 100 yuan, Li Jigen (transferring the medical expenses for hitting someone) 40 yuan, totaling 28,740 yuan in savings certificates, with a balance of 1,196,048 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Hirota, Director of Intelligence, Talks About Britain and the United States Pleasing the Soviet Union and Sacrificing Small European Countries <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Hirota, Director of Intelligence of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, gave a speech to the Chinese news reporters group at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 23rd).</p>
<p>Exposing the Conspiracy</p>
<p>Director Guangdu said that regarding the battle situation in the four-four-mile islands in the European theater, all newspapers published correct news, but Britain and the United States used this to display political and diplomatic tricks, so we have to pay special attention to this issue to expose the conspiracy of Britain and the United States. Where is the cleverness of Britain's means of concealment? We now point out the following: First, to obliterate the Polish government, and second, to take the opportunity to implement the cancellation of the Atlantic Charter. Two months after the start of the German-Polish war, Poland was defeated by Germany, and the Polish government went into exile in London. Afterwards, in order to help Poland, Britain launched a large-scale propaganda campaign against Germany, and in August 1940, U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill met in the Atlantic and issued the Atlantic Charter, which guaranteed the free survival, sovereignty, independence, and integrity of all small countries, and at the same time did not change the territory of small countries.</p>
<p>Polish People's Expectations</p>
<p>The people of Poland followed the publication of the Atlantic Charter, and the Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile in London, General Sikorski, also established a government in exile in London. In 1941, Polish prisoners were formed into Polish troops in Soviet territory and went to Iran to join the anti-Axis group. However, Britain and the United States took the opportunity to please the Soviet Union and worked harder to maintain close ties with the Soviet Union. In May 1942, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov went to London and Washington to consult with the British and American top authorities on the aid to the Soviet Union plan. In addition to requesting a large supply of Soviet munitions, he also requested to open a first front in Europe. However, Britain and the United States failed to implement this for two years, and the Soviet Union expressed its intention to withdraw from the anti-Axis. The United States and Britain did not hesitate to ease the Soviet Union's position. At the Casablanca Conference in North Africa, they recognized the Soviet Union's right to expand its territory in Europe. Afterwards, at the end of February of this year, a bloody incident of mass graves occurred in the Soviet Union, which was horrifying. Since the occurrence of the case, the Polish government in exile has been greatly dissatisfied with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Obliterating Poland</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month, the British government took advantage of the occupation of Tunisia in North Africa as the highest point, but it was considered unnecessary for the British government to move the Polish government in exile to Cairo. In addition, in June, it cultivated its strength in North Africa with Giraud. At that time, the British government ordered the Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile, General Sikorski, to come to London, but unfortunately, Sikorski was killed in a plane crash on the way from Cairo to London. Sikorski's tragic death made the British government's assassination cases against other countries more obvious.</p>
<p>Sacrificing Small Countries</p>
<p>Now, the Polish government in exile has been obliterated, and even small countries such as Finland and Romania have been obliterated, which has led to the fact that Britain and the United States have denied the Atlantic Charter they signed. On July 13, when British Prime Minister Churchill raised this issue in Parliament, he said, "For the survival of great powers, the territory of small countries does not need to be considered." Deputy Prime Minister Attlee made it clear that "the provisions of the Atlantic Charter cannot guarantee the territory of small countries." The content is tortuous and cleverly conceals Britain's criminal behavior, which is no different from detective novels. We have to pay special attention to the following two points: (1) Britain and the United States have canceled the Atlantic Charter in order to get rid of the constraints of the Atlantic Charter. (2) In order to seek their own interests, Britain and the United States sacrifice small countries, and even use all kinds of criminal acts to assassinate small country leaders.</p>

<p>In the past, the Japanese military authorities have returned the factories managed by the Japanese military in the Central China region to Chinese management for as many as eleven times. This time, it has been decided to return the five factories belonging to the Shen Xin Textile Factory, the Wuzhou Guben Soap Factory, and the Hexing Iron Factory, a total of 24 factories, to China for independent management.

According to the past, a total of 140 factories in Central China were managed by the Japanese military. As of this time, 130 factories have been returned to China, leaving only 10 factories.</p>

<p>The city's full-scale air defense drill was the second day on the 23rd. The air defense supreme authorities issued air raid emergency alarms four times in the morning and afternoon, and it was lifted at around 11 p.m. The two-day exercise came to an end.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the first day of the air defense exercise, the Italian merchant ship Conte Verde, which was anchored in the Huangpu River, carried out an air defense drill. Its hypothetical scenario was "At 2 p.m. on the 22nd, enemy planes invaded from the northwest of Shanghai, and at 2:30 p.m., a bomb was dropped on the Conte Verde, causing a fire and many casualties." During the drill, customs fire boats and rescue boats rushed towards the Conte Verde, which was surrounded by thick smoke, and worked hard to save the ship. The situation of putting out the fire was extremely realistic.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Expanding the Investigation <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Materials Investigation Committee has been conducting a district-by-district investigation of the materials stored in warehouses and godowns throughout the city. The preliminary work has now been completed, and the results will soon be revealed step by step. The committee held another meeting yesterday and decided to conduct a further expanded investigation to completely eliminate the practice of hoarding in the city. This is truly heartening!</p>
<p>The so-called expanded investigation, as we have previously suggested, means that in addition to warehouses and godowns, even private residences should be investigated. This will ensure that hoarders and speculators completely lose their shelter, that the majority and large quantities of materials are completely removed from the hands of a few, so that they can circulate throughout the entire society, stabilize prices, and ensure the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Preventing the monopoly of materials is a prerequisite for regulating and supervising prices, and the strategy of investigating hoarding must prioritize releasing materials. Releasing yarn and cloth is what we demand, and releasing daily necessities is also what we demand.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Business Control Council Plans to Implement Unified Allocation of Flour and Bran <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Business Control Council, in accordance with the "Provisional Plan for Unified Purchase of Wheat" approved by the Executive Yuan, has established branch offices in major wheat-producing areas in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces to register wheat merchants' qualifications and implement purchase regulations. Now that wheat has been purchased in a unified manner, flour and bran should also be allocated in a unified manner. The "Provisional Plan for Flour and Bran Allocation" has also been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. Before the "Provisional Plan for Flour and Bran Allocation" is announced, the council will first conduct a registration of flour and bran inventory, and has issued a circular to all regional branch offices to follow the registration procedures. The registration procedures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Flour mills in all regions shall fill out and submit the flour and bran daily report forms prescribed by the council to the branch offices for reporting to the council on a daily basis. From now on, movement is absolutely prohibited, and no further sales are allowed (except with the approval of the council). From July 1st, the quantity of flour and bran produced and the quantity of flour and bran moved must be reported retroactively. (2) Flour and bran merchants in all regions shall immediately register all existing inventory. From the date of registration, all inventory is prohibited from being moved. However, for local daily needs, an application may be made to the council's office through the trade association for allocation and a temporary movement certificate will be issued.</p>

<p>The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Business Control Council, based on the unified wheat purchase plan, will dispatch instructors and staff in six groups to the interior to purchase wheat for allocation to various flour mills. At the same time, the instructors are also responsible for guiding the business of wheat merchants in the interior and investigating whether their wheat purchasing activities violate any laws, so as to report to higher authorities and take appropriate measures against illegal merchants.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the month, prices in the city have risen sharply, and speculative merchants have taken the opportunity to engage in large-scale black market trading, causing prices to rise several times a day, which has greatly harmed society and the people's livelihood. Since the Materials Investigation Committee launched an investigation into warehouse inventories throughout Shanghai last week, and the concession authorities simultaneously severely cracked down on illegal trading of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and gold ornaments, the prices of yarn and cloth have been falling continuously in recent days. It is reported that the Materials Investigation Committee held another meeting yesterday (the 23rd) afternoon to thoroughly discuss and dispose of the results of the investigation. It was decided to severely punish all hoarding merchants. Therefore, it is expected that the market prices of yarn and cloth will return to normal in the future. As for other items such as soap and matches among daily necessities, the prices have continued to rise sharply in recent days. The relevant authorities are also quite concerned about this phenomenon. It is expected that after the handling of the hoarding of yarn and cloth cases is completed, work will begin to handle the hoarding of daily necessities.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Stock Market Trends <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market showed a hovering state, with fluctuations gradually narrowing. After two days of sharp rises, the pullback has been significant. Those who hold stocks are unwilling to sell cheaply, and new and old investors are afraid to add too much. Amidst the struggle between the two sides, it is difficult to predict who will win. However, trading was quite active. Buying of cultural stocks was particularly strong. Furthermore, the news of the World Book Company's capital increase has been confirmed. Amidst the buying frenzy, selling disappeared, and unexpectedly, the stock soared. Commercial Press broke through the major barrier and reached unprecedented high prices. China remained at the nine-yuan level. Yongxiang Printing also reported strong gains. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Sino-French Pharmacy held firm. New Asia, Mutual Benefit, Five Continents, and China West all saw considerable increases. Star Perfumery approached the barrier. Among the department store stocks, Wing On, Sincere, and National Goods rose in a roundabout way. Liyan Department Store continued to rise sharply. Underwear stocks Jinglun and Jingfu both saw increases. Among the textile stocks, Wing On Textile and Dasheng Factories 1, 3 saw slight gains. However, because the amounts were large, investors were limited in their strength, making it difficult to be widespread. Small-denomination stocks progressed faster. Hongsheng Weaving reappeared. It is heard that a certain bank is cautiously absorbing it. Greater China Weaving remained flat. National Trust Dyeing and Weaving and Dingxin were quite firm. Rongfeng and Xinhe advanced. Among public utilities, China Water and Chinese Electric both saw gains. British American Tobacco rose again. Yuan Zhiguan still showed a firm trend. Defeng Knitting, Guomin Dairy, and Dahua Animal Husbandry rose in unison. China Xing Rice continued to jump up. Jiu'an and Greater China Industries, China and Guohua Investments rose again. New Benefit Real Estate rose to the barrier together, with Yisheng rising more vigorously.</p>

<p>Renfeng Machinery Weaving and Dyeing Factory Co., Ltd. was founded in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China. With complete internal investment and magnificent scale, it has always been known as a giant in China's industrial world. When it was founded, the factory was located on Qiqihar Road in Shanghai. The factory covered an area of more than 17 acres, with self-built steel-concrete buildings and new factory buildings. The entire factory is divided into power, water intake, steam, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, finishing, and decoration departments. The products include indanthrene, fine cloth, various bleached cloths, twill, poplin, drill, serge, velveteen, linen yarn, foreign yarn, serge silk, yuanyuchou, white satin and more than forty other kinds, enjoying a high reputation.

At the end of October in the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China, the factory was officially returned to the company, which repaired all the machinery. It is now preparing to resume operations in the shortest possible time. Capital is being increased through the New Asia Construction Company. The total authorized capital is now 40 million Central Reserve Certificates, divided into 4 million shares, with a par value of 10 Central Reserve Certificates per share.

<h3 id="e54">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: This morning, major silver shops and jewelry gold shops in the city still exchanged against the limit price of "Tian Yu Xu" (a kind of Chinese coin), but there was no goods on the market. Trading outside the industry recovered firmly, but the fluctuations were extremely narrow, and trading was not active. The price did not reach the eight-yuan level. The price of silver outside the industry was the same as yesterday.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: Unified Bonds A, B, Ding, and Mao all rose. However, Bond C alone saw a small decline.</p>
<p>Discount Rate: The Money Industry Association's discount rate was initially set at 24%, but later it was heard that it had been raised to 25%.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: The market sentiment is still extremely weak, trading is still light, and prices are lower than yesterday. Longtou fine cloth fell sharply. Sijunzi Yeji has fallen, Sanyang Yeji fell further, and Taohua Ladies' poplin spot also decreased.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn: The market situation is still extremely bleak, prices are quite sluggish, with few transactions. Only 20-count Shuangma orders were opened, and the price was the same as the previous day.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabrics: Recently, French flannel has been very scarce on the market, because only continuous sales are possible, and there is no production. Government goods are bought at the set price, and imported goods must also be sold at the set price. However, most owners are unwilling to mark the price, because their wholesale price may be above the retail price. Yesterday, the government limit price for gray imported French flannel was 1200 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Various Industry Associations to Submit Work Reports <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>In order to promote association affairs and communicate opinions, the Business Control Council has recently created a daily work report form and a question and suggestion form for each joint association, and distributed them to the various industry associations to fill out. The council also regularly sends personnel to contact them for communication. The above forms must be signed and stamped by the responsible persons of the joint association and submitted to the president through the specialist designated by the council for review.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Activities of Various Trade Associations <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>

<h3 id="e57">The Business Control Council's Current Urgent Tasks Discussing Seven Important Issues <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(5) The issue of joint operation cooperatives. Among important materials, only rice is not within the scope of the Business Control Council and is handled by the joint operation cooperatives directly under the Grain Department. However, whether the food issue should be uniformly included in the Business Control Council, this point has been discussed by the Ministry of Finance, the Grain Department, and the Ministry of Industry since the 14th. From the perspective of control theory, it should be uniformly dispatched by the Business Control Council. There is no reason to oppose it. However, under the current circumstances, how this issue is decided, the Business Control Council should also be fully concerned.</p>
<p>(6) The issue of enacting control regulations. When the Business Control Council was transferred to the Executive Yuan last time, it was decided that the Business Control Council would handle the amendment and enactment of relevant regulations. However, at the Supreme National Defense Conference on the 9th, the revised points decided that the relevant ministry would handle it on behalf of the Business Control Council. This amendment and enactment matter, but in the future, the orders related to the Business Control Council will of course not be announced by the relevant ministry, but directly ordered by the Executive Yuan. Before the promulgation of laws and regulations, the Business Control Council can also fully express its opinions to the Executive Yuan regarding its original plan. This change in the power of enactment will not have any impact on the Business Control Council's relationship directly under the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>(7) The issue of establishing a Nanjing office. Director Tang and Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry have separately stated that a Business Control Council office will be established in Nanjing at the end of this month or the beginning of August to strengthen the connection between the National Government and the Business Control Council.</p>
<p>In addition to the above issues, the current urgent tasks of the Business Control Council are innumerable. In short, if the work of the Business Control Council is not effectively promoted, and the political power of prestige and health is created, then there may be a temporary local success, but a permanent Chinese controlled economy cannot be established. The Business Control Council must know that the success of Japan, Germany, the Soviet Union and other countries in implementing wartime controlled economies all depends on their strong political power. In China, if you want the controlled economy to succeed, you need to first establish a strong political power. Due to this meaning, the center of the new policy has to focus on repairing and clarifying politics. This point is especially worthy of our attention.

<h3 id="e58">Prices and Thrift <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Chenghong</p>
<p>Our country has always been an agricultural country, so industry is not developed. Before the war, all industrial products were mostly dependent on Britain and the United States. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, shipping was interrupted, imports were stopped, and the lack of materials was naturally expected. In addition, general merchants only sought exorbitant profits and disregarded the people's livelihood, engaging in speculation and hoarding. Because of these two reasons, prices rose like a kite with a broken string. Originally, during the war, the production rate of all production institutions will inevitably decrease due to the impact of war mobilization. The reduction in production will naturally affect the rise in prices, so during wartime, no country can avoid high prices. Even the United States, which is known as the country of gold and dollars, is unavoidable, and our country is even more prominent due to the aforementioned two reasons.</p>
<p>Another reason that promotes high prices is the unrestricted consumption. This phenomenon is more common in general big cities—especially Shanghai. The result of extravagance and waste on the one hand promotes rising prices due to excessive waste of materials, and on the other hand creates a atmosphere of arrogance and luxury that weakens the war effort. Therefore, excessive waste of materials is the main reason for promoting rising prices, so when talking about the price issue, we cannot ignore starting with thrift first.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Diligence and thrift build a family, ease and pleasure destroy the person." The so-called diligence is to actively increase production; the so-called thrift is to save. It can be seen that the two words diligence and thrift are related. If one is diligent but not thrifty, or thrifty but not diligent, it will still be of no avail. Therefore, simply talking about thrift is not enough, we must also actively increase production. The two must cooperate with each other to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>The importance of thrift has long been said by predecessors, and it is by no means a newly created term now. However, people now are accustomed to extravagance and addicted to comfort, and have long put this virtue behind them, forgetting it cleanly.</p>
<p>In a peaceful era, if the people do not pay attention to thrift, it will inevitably lead to personal economic difficulties, and on a larger scale, it will make the entire national economy on the verge of bankruptcy. In wartime, if the people still do not realize it and only take pleasure in indulgence and extravagance, and waste materials for pleasure, then the consequences will be even more unimaginable. Therefore, the current daily life of the people of friendly Japan is already under the guidance and supervision of the government, completing the wartime system, and the people themselves can be more self-aware, obey and practice. They dedicate all manpower and materials to the country. Looking back at our country, although we have participated in the war for more than half a year, the lives of some people are still as wasteful and extravagant as before. How can we seek victory in the war if we continue like this?</p>
<p>If everyone can save material resources and cherish materials, then the difficulties of high prices may be alleviated, personal life can also be slightly stabilized, and the country's economic strength can also be increased. The Shanghai News Association, in view of the urgent need for the thrift movement, specially advocated it. The regulations it has formulated are simple, concise, and easy to implement. It is expected that the social atmosphere will change as a result. It is hoped that this movement will be promoted from a corner of Shanghai to all parts of the country; and it is hoped that government officials will lead by example and be a role model for the people. Only in this way can the top follow the bottom and achieve success in the end, without repeating the mistakes of other movements.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Record of Inquiry at the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Convent (3) <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>According to the nuns, the convent's embroidery used to be famous throughout the world, winning awards at the Rome Achievement Exhibition. Foreign orders were so numerous that they could not be met. The other departments also increased the number of workers to six or seven hundred due to the needs of all sectors. It was indeed a great source of livelihood for orphaned and poor women. Unfortunately, it has been affected by the war in recent years. Foreign orders have been cut off, and domestic needs have also seen a sharp decline. Most of the current female workers are married orphaned women in the convent, because the wages in the convent cannot maintain the lives of female workers outside the convent. However, according to the reporter's inquiries with the female workers, they said that they would rather get less pay and work in the convent than try to sell rice or go to general factories, because the convent's workshop is as harmonious and quiet as a family, and they get priceless spiritual rewards! The attached nursery specializes in taking care of the children of female workers, bringing them in the morning and taking them back after work. There are other staff in the nursery who will take care of everything, so that mothers do not have to worry. How many factories now have this kind of reasonable facilities?</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Sisters' Efforts <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Sacred Heart Convent Orphanage is under the leadership of Grand Mother Superior Bu Rongxian. There are more than seventy sisters, including French, Italian, British, and American people, who are actually working. The Sisters devote themselves to the work in the convent. They not only passively receive orphans, but also focus on actively teaching and raising them. They do not only know how to spoil the bodies of their children like ordinary parents in the world. Based on their religious transcendental concepts, they enable orphans to receive true goodness in all aspects of spirit, study, and morality. For health care, they also set up well-equipped wards, managed by nuns with medical knowledge, and famous doctors volunteer to provide free medical treatment. In case of dangerous and urgent illnesses, they are sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Therefore, as soon as an orphan enters the convent, the sisters regard her as their own daughter, and plan and guarantee her lifelong happiness. Although the sisters have different nationalities, they love and help each other under the same goal of sacrifice and service, and cooperate happily without taking any material rewards. All donations are not used for anything other than the orphans, and are completely separated from the sisters' own expenses, which is especially commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e61">An Urgent Crisis <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Can the orphan's paradise really exist so smoothly? No! The tide of the situation and prices has long been attacking this paradise and is about to plunge it into a crisis of complete collapse. In the past, most of the convent's funding was donated by French philanthropists. It has no funds or savings of its own. After the European War, foreign donations were cut off, and prices rose day by day, and expenses increased day by day. The infants became weaker and weaker due to malnutrition. By the end of last year, it was almost impossible to maintain. Flocks of pigeons were sold, flocks of rabbits were sold, and even the only dairy cows that supplemented their livelihood were left with tears in their eyes one by one. The orphan's paradise was also on the verge of the end. Fortunately, this year's New Year, an application was made to the Shanghai Poverty and Disease Relief Association for subsidies. After Mr. Ji Zhendong, a member of the committee, went to investigate, he believed that urgent subsidies were necessary. As a result, the convent received two subsidies totaling 120,000 yuan, which rescued the lives of hundreds of dying orphans. However, at a time when prices are soaring endlessly, just maintaining the food for more than 500 orphans requires more than 60 shi of rice per month, and the source has not yet been determined. No wonder the nuns complain and say, "We are all people who have left home to seek the Tao, where can we get this huge sum of money to maintain this career that has been inherited for seventy-four years? However, these orphans have been abandoned by their parents, how can we bear to see them abandoned by the crowd again?" The glorious and brilliant achievements of the convent have caused people to exclaim in admiration. Its contribution to society and the country cannot be estimated by numbers. The current crisis of the convent's survival is imminent. There is no lack of enlightened and charitable people in society who should strive to be the first to do good deeds. At the same time, we also hope that the products of the convent's workshop can be appreciated by the society, and that the business can be improved and developed with the help of all parties, which can also open up a new path. We want to turn the tears of love of the sisters and orphans today into the light of human love in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Urgent Improvements Needed for Railway Travel Issues <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Recently, people have been complaining about the troublesome procedures involved in railway travel, and the general public regards it as a daunting journey. Previously, the problems arising from passengers queuing to enter stations had attracted considerable public attention. Since the matter was raised by public opinion, the railway authorities have made some improvements to the entry procedures to facilitate passengers, which is commendable. However, apart from this, matters such as ticket purchase, inspection, queuing, boarding, and other unexpected difficulties have become even more severe recently.</p>
<p>Due to the railway authorities' implementation of passenger number restrictions in the past half-month, passenger travel has become even more inconvenient. The authorities, in view of the recent hot weather, aim to avoid overcrowding in the carriages and the spread of epidemics, and therefore have taken these measures. This has precedents in Japan and European countries, but in our country, the result is the creation of various inconveniences in travel.</p>
<p>The Shanghai station, as the intersection of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, sees no less than thousands of passengers passing through daily. The crowding situation in the station is the most severe. There are those who have purchased tickets but cannot enter the station, and those who have waited for two or three days without being able to board the train. This not only directly affects the livelihoods of ordinary people eager to return home, but also hinders passengers traveling on official business. This is one issue. Suzhou, located in the capital of Jiangsu Province, has a particularly high number of passengers traveling to Shanghai every day. The area has recently introduced regulations for passengers traveling to Shanghai. Although the number of Shanghai train tickets sold daily is limited, the number sold is still less than the stipulated amount. Generally speaking, only a few hundred third-class tickets are sold daily, and the procedures are even more troublesome than before. As a result, train prices have been inflated, creating the strange phenomenon of black market train tickets. The third-class train fare from Suzhou to Shanghai is 13.1 yuan, but the black market price has reached 50 or 60 yuan. This is the second issue. Railway police were originally established to protect the railway lines and passenger safety, but now railway police officers are abusing their power, carrying out arbitrary inspections, and wantonly insulting passengers. This is the third issue. The control of materials is an important policy of wartime states, but many ignorant merchants are using the railway to transport controlled goods for profit, which should be suppressed. These "single-carrier" merchants travel back and forth on the railway lines, and their numbers even exceed those of ordinary passengers, leaving ordinary passengers with no room to stand in the carriages. This is the fourth issue.</p>
<p>Based on the above four points, we can understand the difficulties of railway travel. The improvement methods are: In the active aspect, to avoid the current passenger congestion, it is best to increase the number of train services within the possible range. The temporary regional trains recently added from Shanghai Station on the Beijing-Shanghai line have increased from one to three or four, which is a clear example. However, there are only two Beijing-Shanghai express trains every day. Considering the current situation, it seems necessary to increase them. With more train services, there will naturally be no phenomenon of crowding, but the allocation of vehicles and fuel and other issues should also be considered in detail. On the passive side, on the one hand, railway merchants should be strictly suppressed. On the other hand, it is hoped that people will voluntarily economize and reduce the number of trips as much as possible.</p>
<p>Considering that the railway is the lifeline of national transportation, and Beijing and Shanghai are the political and economic centers of the country, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines have important geographical value. Therefore, the frequency of railway travel is also a common phenomenon, and the various problems of travel must be appropriately resolved. Now, I would like to propose a few points: (1) Adjust boarding procedures. (2) Improve the inspection system. (3) Suppress railway merchants. (4) Coordinate passengers and trains. The above four points are all urgent issues at present. It is hoped that the railway authorities will adopt them, which will greatly benefit the improvement of transportation and the welfare of the people. (Lu Wanyi)</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The fact that the station was able to open its main entrance last time, allowing passengers to avoid the suffering of being squeezed, was all due to the promotion of public opinion. This truly benefited travelers greatly. However, recently, stations on both lines have severely restricted the sale of tickets, providing only a very small number of tickets to passengers, resulting in black market tickets that cost several times more than the original price. These black market tickets mostly come from ordinary peddlers and hawkers who peddle around the station, scrambling and causing great disorder. This situation repeatedly fails to manage transportation properly, and passengers traveling to and from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines feel particularly pained. If they have urgent matters, they are further hindered by the tickets and cannot board the train on time, resulting in losses in both time and money. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to making improvements. (Fang Zhengyi)</p>

<h3 id="e63">Qiming Bookstore Offers Preferential Treatment to Students <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Qiming Bookstore sent a letter yesterday stating: "The 28-size, 16-page Western-style newspaper notebooks produced by our bookstore are bound with specially thick paper and are economical and practical. At a time when paper prices are soaring and students cannot afford them, our bookstore does not want to profit, and is specifically offering another 1,000 dozen at a special price (which, according to current paper prices, is not enough to cover the cost). In order to support your newspaper's education fund, we will also donate 10% of the sales proceeds, as a token of our sincerity."
