<p>社評</p>
<h3>紗布配給程序商榷</h3>
<p>本月二十一日，我們會以『紗布收買以後怎樣？」爲題，對於紗布配給辦法，，綜合各方意見，貢獻若干原則，以期當局籌議辦法之時，慎重參攷。其中第三點關於配給程序，我們主張原則上應減少經過層次，因爲層次一多，則手續繁，時間久，費用大，其結果將予受配給者以時間與經濟上的損失。在這一原則之下，我們認爲「聯合會」一級，如能省去，則更可敏捷，而「批發商」一級是分利的，重疊的，無存在的必要。我們這種主張，是基於受配給大衆，减輕消費負擔，共同的優惠的觀點。當然，對於批發商少數的利益，無法兼顧的。如果另有一個辦法，對於消費者的負擔並不十分影響，而兼顧到過去正當批發商的合法利潤，過渡時期繼續存在，維持該業同人的全體生活。對這問題，頃由紗布業領袖某君來函表示意見，茲摘要列次：</p>
<p>「……惟其中第三項有應商榷者，原意主張配給程序中，所經過之層次愈少愈好，理論誠爲至當不移。惟關於事實亦有不能不兼顧者，聯合會為生產者與消費者共同組織之機關。實業部訂立法規時，加此一種機織，推其用意，爲使兩種或三四種之同業公會，於一種或多種物品供求發生爭執時，可由該會之理事會協商決定。此租情形，外縣尤有存在之必要，惟聯合會不應於配給物資時微收手續費，以免剝削，似應於法規中訂明，以防流弊。批發商應否存在，等於日商經營紗布業者之洋行應否存在。現在紗號業同業公會會員共計六百餘家，布號業同業公會會員共計二千六百餘家。此等商號如全部將其消滅，則同業公會即將無形解散。部意凡係事變以前，正常經營紗布業者之批發商，向來以貨物供給工廠或零售商店，有帳簿回單可以證明者，應准共繼續營業，即事變以後，新設之同類商號亦應聽其存在，如係經營囤積投機之商號，應由同業公會檢舉，將其取消，如此方足以昭公允，現在棉紗由黑市之三萬元，經政府一萬元之定價收買，耶酌加批發商之合法利潤，對於一般民衆之負擔，可謂至微，同時，使數十萬人（以蘇浙皖三省計）免於凍餒，亦未始非政府體恤民間疾苦之美意。」</p>
<p>我們對於來函意見，以本業經騐兼顧事實，自也足供當局考慮。我們前此主張的中心，在於「節省時間」興「减輕負擔」，因此兼顧事實，必以不背此二原則爲前提，庶幾爲合理的「兼顧」。</p>
<h3>讀青木大臣對談後</h3>
<p>日本青木大東亞大臣，前此蒞臨我國與國府當局會談，並考察對華新政策實施後各方面情況，並往華北經滿洲國回日。嗣就中國統制經濟　政治強化問題與日本新聞社記者對談，（譯文載今日本報第二版）我們讀了，略申感想如次：</p>
<p>靑木大臣重申對華政策之目標，在於協助中國之獨立自由，以交還租界爲實施協力的契機。對於一部分中國人十未能明瞭其重要性，引爲遺憾。並批評上海一部分人多年來脫却國家的統治，完全過慣了個人本位的生活所致。我們屢次申言，就友邦人士的立塲，推行對華新政策的重心，應注意「行之彌堅」與「不求急功」，因爲中國人一般性格對於「新」的事物，常抱着不輕易信任的態度，非經過相當時間的體騐，不會立即相信的。可是，等到相、信以後，也不輕易變態的。就中國人的立塲，對於日本新政策的實踐經過，必須淸楚考察，隨時以接受與認識的態度表示暸解，俾過去誤會的成見，漸次消除，漸次接近。這是中日人士在兩國邦交更進一步的今天，所應深切認清的。</p>
<p>靑木大臣對於中國物價問題的觀察，以牧資不足爲最大原因，因此，一再提到農工增產問題，而表示日本也願協力推進解決此項問題。青木大臣是經濟專家，會擔任國府最高經濟顧問。他對於中國經濟上的意見，自然值得我們注意。可是增加生產一點，不但我們言之屢再，就是政府也已定爲國策。不過，在實施上尚未見有若何效果。我們昨天會經提出，目前都市與農村的小工業手工業應特別扶植，因爲中國社會是中小工業比較佔優勢的，中小工業生產對於增益物資非常重要。所以，政府應領導金融界竭力扶植，貸給資金，並指導技術，溝通運銷，使其充分自由發展。於此，希望友邦在事實上協助我們解決困難問題。</p>
<p>對於收買紗布一事，譽爲國府政治力的偉大成功。如能以收買的紗布換取農產物及其他必要物資，對於採辦物資及統制物價上，必能發揮更大的效果。我們以中國的立塲，對於靑木大稱　政治上偉大成功，殊爲慚愧，因爲工作方在開始，談到「成功」，距離尚遠。至於以紗布換取農產物一點，尤其是換取米穀，解決上海的民食問題，極爲需要。年來農民心理莫不重視實物，不肯以物換錢，因此，以紗布交換糧食，較爲易行。</p>
<p>末了，我們深感友邦朝野人士對於中國政治經濟問題，非常關心。可是關心還嫌不夠，必須透視中國民間疾苦，了解中國人民心理，才能據以決定以中國人民爲中心的協力方針。强化國府力量，固有頓於日本協力；而强化民間力量，則需要尤甚。中日人士主張協力爭取大東亞勝利者，務必充分瞭解這一深長意義！</p>

<h3>日首相昭告國民　決加强防衛態勢　對行政運營已採必要措置</h3>
<p>東京二十二日申央社電　日東條首相二十二日在此問中央廣播電毫，以「告官民」爲題，向日本全國國民廣播·說明政府此次在決戰下，加强國內態勢之各項施行，並期望日木官民對此常積極協力。茲誌東條首相演講大意如次：「官民諸君，自前年十二月八日，日本一億國民拜奉大詔，爲自存自衛奮烈蹶起後，迄今無論在作戰上，建設上，已有巨大之進展，此在世界史上，實無其例。回憶余奉命組閣以來，已垂二年，尤其是在大東亞戰爭以後，爲貫澈大東亞戰爭目的，加强國內態勢，而傾莫大之勢力，近日英美猶不惜一切犧牲，謀在短期間內挽囘其頹勢，乃迭作反攻，戰事之激烈，與日俱深，如今已踏進緊急關頭　我一億國民，尤應一新其決意，當以斷然之恿氣，舉其總力集中於戰爭之完遂。蓋際此危急之時，一致奮起盡忠，實爲我國必勝之根源，三千年來日本國民能排除一切外敵，保持光輝之國體者、實爲異有此種特性所然，而政府茲於國政運營上作積極之刷新，今後更使軍部與內閣益趨緊密，以期途行雄軍活潑之戰爭及推進在外施策，故澈底加强國內諸般態勢，決意謀戰力急速增强。</p>
<h3>朝野協力　貫澈目標</h3>
<p>政府加强國內態勢之目標、有下列數點：　舉官民之力，貫澈悠久之國體觀念，　以必勝信念，舉整個國力謀軍需生產，特別是航空戰力之急速增强。　確立日滿兩團之糧食自給自足。政府爲貫澈此項目標，此次所採之方策，其主要點有（甲）謀行政運營之決戰化。按行政運營已採取必要之措政，已曾大規模實分行政之簡素化，政府茲鑒於戰局之現階段，乃更進而整理官廳，廢除不必要之措置及施行裁減人員等，以加强行政運營之切適。（乙）為謀澈底動員國力，政府爲應付目　戰局加强戰力·適應作戰之要求及增强生產起見，對國民動員，已採取澈底之措置，政府此次對國民動員所決定之方針，更實施各項緊急對策後，使一般　生參加作戰，至於對主要之理工科等，各部門敎育政府已謀其措置萬全。（丙）為謀澈底加强國內防衛態勢，蓋防衛國土，實以防空爲主，爲防衛帝都及重要都市，以策萬全，乃爲應有之措置，政府對此，久決定整理，各官廳學校，並將不必　帝都，各重要者市之官廳遷移他往，實行整理各種外廊，團體統制關，統制會社等，並對其業務按整理廳應辦法作澈底之刷新，以謀人員之縮减，爲加强海陸運輪及價格配給之制度簡素化，以貢獻於加強戰力。以上所述各項措置，當斷然付諸實施，對其弊害，當澈底排除，此爲政府之決意，英美之反攻，日益　烈，職局之前途，乃愈益複雜，但此次之戰爭，乃爲排除束亞之禍根，確立東亞永久之和平，及保全帝國光榮之戰爭，其勝利常屬日本，法國等雖遠柱歐洲，但帝國介紹緊密之提携，迭獲助利之光榮，余於此謹對各盟邦祈福，同時對中滿泰緬及其他大東亞諸國家之對日協力，謹表莫大之敬意與謝意，並祝其國溉昌隆。</p>
<h3>國政運營大綱內容包含三點</h3>
<p>東就廿二日中央社電　日政府鑑於當前世界戰局之緊張情況，為期確立必勝態勢，總動　軍官民，傾舉人力物力。與全部施策，勇往　進，務獲戰爭勝利起見，會以東條首相作中心，聚精會神，以研究國政運營方針，頃已協有方案。乃於廿一日定例閣議中提付審議，前後歴七小時，始將此決戰下　期的國政運營大綱決定，此次確立之國政運營大綱概爲三項：　保持軍部與內閣間之密切關係。　確立決戰國內態勢。　推進適切而活發之外交。日政府之强化國內態勢方　。已於廿二日下午七時卅分，由情報局發表如次。日政府自大東亞戰爭開始以來，迄今已實行途行戰爭上之各種必要施策，茲鑒於國內外之時局現狀，須適應雄渾活潑之作戰，決毅然施行如次方策，期更進一步强化國內態勢，以完途大東亞戰爭目的國內態熱勢强化方策，以下爲要點：第一，强化國內態勞之目標，依據如次諸點，（甲）使官民間透澈了解此次戰爭之本義，並使覺悟共成功之非易，決抱必勝之倌念，以披瀝不屈不撓盡忠報國之赤誠，（乙）傾注國力期急速增强軍需生產，尤着重於航空戰力之飛羅擴充。（丙）確立日滿兩國食糧之絕對自給態勢。（丁）國謀國內防衛態勢之澈底强化。第二，爲强化國內態勞，須特別　　如次方策，（甲）爲遂行政運營之一決戰化，故採取如次方針，　政務執行之澈底迅速化，　預算之澈底單純化，　官廳事　之澈底簡　一化，　整理行政機構人員一再度縮減，　圖謀官廳事務之決戰化，例如廢止星一期六休假制，且無間　夜或休假日使官　機能之運營不間斷。（乙）爲謀國民動員之澈底化起見，決定：停止一般應召遲廷，對於理工科系統之學生設定人營延期制，整頓擴充理工科系統之學校，並統合整理法文科系統之大學專門學校，　擴大普通應“征用範圍，撤廢掌理一特權，技術者以外之除外一例，　强化女子動員。（丙）爲澈底强化國內防衛態勢，特採取如次方策，　圖謀國內防衛行政運營之統一，　對於國家重要地區，軍事上重要設施及軍事上重要工塲礦山極力强化防衛，　爲期東京及重要都市之防衛萬全起見，對於此等都市之官廳工塲民宅等加以必要整理，（丁）略。（戊）圖謀海陸輸送之强化。（己）史强化金融及國民貯蓄，澈底謀使資金集中於戰力，藉發揮其最大之效力。（庾）圖謀價格及配給制席之澈底簡素化。（辛）整理各官廳之各種外部團體及澈底刷新共運營業務。（壬）對於各種統制機關及統制社會之生產，加以澈底之整理，並對其業務及事務加以澈底的刷新及減縮其人員。</p>
<p>毅然排除萬難務期急速實現</p>
<p>按日政府此次確立國內態勢强化方策，對於行政運營之決心，强化國民動員之澈底，國內防衛態勢之强化，實具有重大意義。日政府並爲具體實現此　策　見，抱異常之決心，排除萬難，務期急速實現，決不拘於既有法律及預算、毅然採取此項措置，故各省刻正依據此次國內態勢强化方策，迅速製成各省實行方案，期於本月廿六日前，將原案提究內閣，經內閣四長官會議加以商討後，即可於本月杪擬爲成案、下月初即可提付閣議，俟將其決定後即刻付諸實施。關於該案之實行尚需各種法律及預算上之措置、故日政府刻正考　中、逢必要時將奏請召集臨時議會。</p>
<h3>日本女子組織　勤勞挺身隊</h3>
<p>東京廿二日中央社電　日政府頃決定對女子可代担當之簡易職業，限制由男子就業、同時爲促進女子勤勞動員計，實施組微女子勤勞挺身隊，此事業經日閣議通過，並已於廿一日下午由厚生省發表。蓋隨戰爭之延長、女子動勞動員之强化機充，乃屬必然·德英美蘇亦已先後實施，美勞動部長潘金斯曾謂美國本年內增加之四百五十萬新勞動者中，女子幾佔三百萬。又據英勞動部長貝文稱，目前於軍需方面直接或間接從事工作之婦女已達八百六十七萬·中有三百五十萬爲已婚或育有不滿四歲幼兒之寡婦。故日本雖尚未至徵用女子之必要階段，俾隨戰爭之白熱化，預料此後需用女子之情勢巳日益迫切，故此次日政府實施組織女子挺身隊一事，即以徵用女子爲前提，惟因係出於國民之忠誠心而自動編成，故希儘先自動參加之。</p>
<h3>日空軍戰果　昆明機塲遭轟炸</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日大本營二十二日下午二時發表，中國方面帝國陸軍航空部隊於九月十日至二十日之期間連日　聚在中國之敵航空基地船舶及軍事設施等，其詳情如次：　九月十日十一日十二日及十九日四次空襲建甌、十八日　南雄，二十日　昆明南　，轟炸敵各飛機塲，炸毀其滑行路及軍事設施，更在昆明上空與敵機二十餘架交戰，繫落其十八架，（　不確實者八架）且炸毀其停於塲內大型機二十四架以上。　九月十七日空襲宜昌西北八十公里之巴東，十九日　梧州附近，轟炸敵船舶，擊沉擊毀其運輸船七艘及舟艇多數。　九月十八日空襲廣州北方二百公里之乳源，二十日襲廣州西北百二十公里之雲浮附近，轟炸敵各軍事設施，雲浮地方有五處被炸起火。　我方損害為於攻擊昆明時飛機自炸六架。</p>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日本陸軍航空部隊痛炸之昆明市，乃駐渝美空軍主力之根據地，美捷諾特司令部即設於此，該市郊外有大飛機傷兩處，以此爲中心在蒙自雲南　南甯等地復設有多數飛機塲，敵空軍屢以此等機塲為中心地而自昆明出動。襲擊緬甸，甚至襲擊越南。日空軍此次攻擊即以昆明市南方飛機塲爲目標，該傷隣接渝方中央空軍軍官學校，四面每邊長千六百公尺，有四條滑行路，其中最長者達二千數百公尺。又日機前次轟炸昆明爲四月二十九日，傳當日因捷諾特司令不在，職務乃由准將布雷代表，布雷當被日機炸傷。</p>
<p>日隊長談昆明空戰</p>
<p>東京廿二日中央社電　日軍某基地二十二日電、戰鬥機隊某部隊長於二十日率機轟炸昆明，與敵戰鬥機展開激戰，都隊長擊落敵機四架，予敵空軍以大打擊，該部隊長頃就是日戰况談稱、我等到達敵機塲上空時，已有敵戰鬥機二十餘架飛起哨戒，敵機三四架結成一團，自四週實行攻擊，敵以我轟炸機編隊爲作戰目標，故我制敵先機，以高　度迫近敵機羣攻擊敵機，敵我距離較遠時，從不射擊、若接近則行猛射，旋已有敵機四架欲乘隙阻礙我轟炸機編隊作戰，余當即騰空直上，飛　敵機上空，射擊敵機機首，再向下反　，反復對之射擊，須臾敵機機首向下作四十餘度之傾斜，吐出火花，機體乃爲火燄包圍，即行鸞落。當時敵機與我機僅距離五十米，隱隱可見敵駕駛員之面容，未幾又一敵機來襲，於敵機受傷遁走時確中彈，或亦被擊落，是時　機於我機附近擊落敵機爾架，而敵機仍頑强應戰，其注意力完全集中於我聶炸機編隊，而不顧我戰鬥機隊，足　駐渝美空　戰法拙劣與素竹之低下。</p>

<p>日軍某基地二十二日中央社電　中國方面日空軍精銳部隊自七月下旬以來，即展開巧妙奮勇之攻勢，美空軍亦掙扎反攻，兩軍屢不斷開壯烈空戰，自九月後雨季已過戰鬥亦日益熾烈，茲將美空軍最近之情况及其動向略誌於次：美空軍因受日軍攻一勢之痛擊，近乃企圖　起反攻，蓋於八月以前敵之戰法因懼日軍猛擊，向以　　戰術為主，但自八月下旬以後，敵乃一方積　從事補給給作，一方遂漸採取反攻體勢，遂開始進襲廣州，香港，各地襲擊。又於九月後出擊之次數，乃更激增，而敵之戰術亦　非游擊戰可比，不斷乘日軍防衛陣之隙，　謀予日軍以損害，但日軍乘一此機會反　時機予敵軍以重創，且敵空軍投擲炸彈時，因心驚膽戰，或技術拙劣，故僅有無辜之民衆受有傷害、如破壞日方設施，及一切之企圖，即全歸失敗，而敵焦慮出擊之情形。逐漸趨於消極，過去之勇敢已難復見，其戰意之急趨低下，實應注目。蓋此乃敵空軍首腦部急於挽回名譽，故不擇對方還發出擊命令，再另一方敵駕駛員已逐漸認　　空軍之優秀性　駕駛員技術精良，作戰勇猛，故漸自　萎縮，受命後因不得已而日擊，故一遇日機激擊，途即放棄原有之企圖，狼狽逃歸尤以敵B/40型機一經遭遇日戰鬥機隊激擊，立即逃向附近之雲層中，此爲最近常見之醜態。日　敵機空襲廣州地區時、敵戰鬥機因受日機追擊竟躲於轟炸機之腹下，敵機因遭日機之攻擊與邀擊。不僅飛機損失，同時駕駛員亦損失不少，因在此確　事實。敵方因飛機補充困難、及駕駛員不足，而形成嚴重問題，駐渝美空軍。近因稍有補充，目前仍復維持戰鬥機轟炸機共千架之水準，但日機之攻擊常出敵之意料，屢建奇功，而擊滅美空軍之大攻勢已日愈趨熾烈。</p>

<p>德對遊擊隊進行掃蕩戰</p>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　德軍當局二十一日就地中海戰緩之精勢　稱：敵方曾傳稱科西嘉島之德軍已撤退，絕對不確，德軍現仍駐於該島。又德空軍廿日於愛琴海島曾重創英快速艇二艘，轟炸機隊於義南部之戰鬥會猛炸移動之敵軍，並曾進襲撒丁島之敵機塲，更於地中海中其他鳥嶼擊毀停於地上之敵機十架。又敵方會宜稱反軸心軍遊擊部隊於亞特里亞海沿岸各地極爲活躍。實則亞特裏亞海沿岸仍由德軍確保，沮敵遊擊部隊自獲義軍武器以來，最近活躍確屬事實，現德軍正對其主要據　進行　鴻作戰。</p>

<h3>英軍在阿瑪斐　獲得立足點　德軍增援正嚴陣以待</h3>
<p>柏林廿日中央社電　德軍當局廿一日說明義大利戰綫戰況如次。：薩勒諾海面英艦隊對德軍僅作局部轟擊，英軍在阿瑪麥半島（Amalfi）　艦砲射擊掩護，已獲得據點數處，且不　調遣後援軍登陸。反軸心軍似由左翼攻擊加不勒斯，蓋反軸心軍因由加拉布里亞及阿普里亞北上之英第八軍進　特　，故乃發動此舉。而蒙高茂萊將軍一部似在埃巴里地區已與反軸心軍接觸，其主力仍於戰綫之後方。同時據德元首行營二十一日發表：德軍後衛部隊刻在波頓薩東方作戰，幷已擊退英軍，但反軸心軍在該方面正積極再度展開大規模攻勢，作必死之進攻，因此反軸心軍之　極整理部隊，同時德軍於過去數日間，亦曾從事整備部　及增援預備軍·對敵嚴陣以待。</p>
<p>蕯勒諾區大戰詳情</p>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　海通社戰事特派員維伯爾目　薩勒諾前綫之戰事，作詳盡之報告如次：九月九日美第五軍克拉克將軍之部隊，在薩勒諾區登陸，戰事途於沿海岸拔海一千公尺之山區進行。其激烈之程度，比之喀太尼亞區之十日防禦戰猶覺過之。英第四十六步兵師團之報告及英軍事評論共同宜稱，謂此乃最艱苦之作戰。登陸之一日後，克拉克之部隊已陷入　危險之狀態中，德裝甲部隊突施反攻，反軸心之陣綫途極混亂，義軍企圖參加德軍自沿海代戰以抵達德軍之陣綫者稱，反軸心軍之死亡實極重大，謂全地皆佈滿英美軍之屍體。此次實爲英美使用大規模傘兵之第一次，多自空中降落，以圖佔領重要山嶺陣地，並希望彼等能効德國傘兵之英勇，以做成破壞敵軍及開闢重要之交通路綫。英第四十六師之報章亦承認反軸心軍之危急，謂於內地降落之傘兵，多被　備新奇之德軍　滅，在薩勒諾十二天之作戰，德軍二師初與英美軍各二師作戰，反軸心受重大之損失後即仃增援，故敵軍以七師之衆，對德軍二師之兵力，德軍獲悉得與加拉布里亞之友軍獲得連絡，即　獲得極大成功，因敵軍原欲將之切　者也，敵軍於八日前即希望那不勒斯之陷落，但現仍在德軍固守中，反軸心軍之突破或側舉均遭失敗。現薩勒　之戰事已否結束，尚未能立下斷語，乃德軍之避難敵　而不遭敵軍之襲擊，則已實現德軍在此區之指揮　戰術特別巧妙，但以那不勒斯爲中心之薩勒諾前綫再作進一步之避難運動，實極有可能，因現已完成其主要之目的，即與加拉布里來之大軍重獲連絡，且予敵軍以最大之損失也。反軸心軍在此地之損失在一萬五千人以上。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾演說柏林不重視</h3>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　柏林政界對於英首相邱吉爾，昨在下　院發表之演說。並不加以注意。據德外交界消息，邱吉爾演觀極力避免論及軍事問題，因恐引起公正觀察家之疑慮而已。關於義大利判逆之敘述。實有歷史上之意味，亦足使巴特里奧昨日所作呼　義人放下武器及停止作戰行動，而關停戰協定之成立足已遠到此種地步，其假面具即被邱吉爾首相所揭破，邱吉爾會於其演說中透露謂，巴特里奧之代表會向英駐四大使保證巴特里奧政府實欲準備參加英美方面，以與德國作戰　而邱吉爾論及墨索里尼之被救，以傳巴特里奧之解交墨索里尼之計劃失敗。此使反軸心方面亦感極大之失　。</p>
<p>巴特里奧投降經過</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據倫敦通訊，英首相邱吉爾昨於下議院發表演說稱：自墨索里尼政權被推翻後，反軸心國家，即欲設法使義大利當局於　短期內作無條件之投降，並減少反軸心軍之流血至最代限度。巴特里奧政府未幾即派員於各方面試探消息，請問缺陷之條件及解釋投降所將引起之一切困難，反軸心國雖注意其困難之點，但仍堅持無條件降服。八月十五日，義大利外交代表某將軍訪問英駐西班牙大使賀爾，且具有信任狀，以表明係獲得巴特里奧之全權委任者，並告以巴特里奧政府準備於反軸心軍登陸後，即行參加英美方面。當時邱吉爾首相正參加奎貝克會議，於取得羅斯福總統及英戰時內閣之同意後，途決定由反軸心軍地中海方面司令部派遣英美參謀人員赴里斯本，以與巴特里奧之代表接洽、八月十九日，會談於葡京舉行一表謂，僅無條件始可接受，軍事條件亦通知義國代表，彼並不反對，但　其訪問之目的，乃在討論　　參加反軸心方面作戰之問題，義將軍即携條件，返囘羅馬，並聲明於三十一日準再返此地，更以巴特里奧政府之答覆，交與艾森霍　將軍，彼並獲悉將有內政及政治之條件提出之通知。同時另一義國將軍偕同英國前被俘虜之加東將軍抵達，但亦不足影響判之進行，加東將軍亦表示願重作俘虜之地位，但義代表拒絕此項提議，於是加東將軍遂被釋同英。八月卅一日，義代表又與艾森霍華之代表會見，告以巴特里奧願意接受條件，並無保留。和平之宣布，乃在於反軸心方面認爲選擇適當時間、以免爲德所乘，即停戰之宣布，僅於反軸心軍在義本土登陛前之一刻發表，反軸心國家於可能範圍內、將予此可憐之政府以相當之援助。關於交出墨索里尼之計劃，英首相稱：此乃主要條件之一，但於停戰前或反軸心軍登陸前，實不能實行解交之措舉，而反軸心實有充足之理由相信墨索里尼於安穩之地點。加以重兵之守衛，乃墨索里尼之解交、似司實行於一日，但環境之變化，乃出乎反軸心國之所可把握者，而巴特里奧政府之步驟，原已極當心　　彼等未以充足之力量以禁閉墨索里尼，又未能預期德傘兵竟能降落於墨索里尼被禁之地點，義　軍　　，實舉有命令　，倘有欲救之者，當即　殺墨索里尼無赦，投降條件乃於九月三日簽字、蘇聯於研究後。即授權艾森霍華將軍代表蘇聯簽字，如此停戰協定，即獲英美蘇之同意矣。</p>
<h3>艾登外相闡明對西班牙關係</h3>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　英國與西班牙之關係，乃今日下院會議時向外相艾登提出之甚多同題之主題，此項關係包括英駐西大使霍爾爵　與弗期哥將軍新近之會談在內，艾登答霍氏力促弗朗哥注意英政府不時被迫作種種有　歧視英方利益之不滿之怨書，西政府對此項事件雖已辦理數　，惟仍有一部未經故　。有人間及弗朗哥將軍之反響并不有利，則英政府是否已考慮及相當　優，艾登答曰，「四政府已允調查此次不滿狀態，　人深　能及</p>
<h3>英美對德城市　將繼續空襲</h3>

<h3>美生產會主席　納爾遜訪英</h3>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　據倫敦消息：　國生產委員會主席納爾遜，昨日抵達倫敦，即往訪英國生產大臣李特爾頓，此爲納爾遜就任後初次訪英，　係應英生產大臣之邀。在過去一年中，英生產大臣會兩次訪問華盛頓</p>
<h3>澳洲新閣員　已宣誓就職　政府組織不變</h3>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　據此間接獲息，澳洲寇丁第二次政府已於星期一在康白拉宣誓就職，政府之組織與最近選舉之前無異，僅有少許變更，外長艾伐特拒絕出而　選後，陸軍部長　特已　行當選爲工黨副領袖兼副總理，閣員人選如下：總理寇丁，陸軍部長　特，財政部長戚夫　，　法兼外交部長艾伐特、　　部長皮斯萊、海軍部長　金、空軍及民用航空部長特力克福特，戰時組織及工業部長戴特曼、以上各人皆係　戰時內閣人員、其他閣員則如工黨各派之代表，大多數係擁護　工者。　梨晨報評論新內閣稱。第一次寇丁政府之成功，就大體言之，不能掩蔽　各個人選之失敗及弱點，福特之任副領袖，固屬其多年忠心服務之酬勞，但渠並不宜於署　總理職務，　梨訊則謂，有極爲平庸之閣員數人，又復東山再起，工黨之最大弱點。爲位置非常之人，寇丁如欲加强其政府，則宜任用少年英俊者爲次官及助理閣員。</p>
<h3>義駐德使館　人員被扣留</h3>
<p>柏林二十二日中央　　社電　義大使館人員中之並不參加法西斯新政府者，現方留駐巴伐里亞某著名　寒區之旅邸中。大使館之人員及多數爲新聞記者之義平民，本已乘專束之列首途返義，但義土及巴特里奧逃亡後，義國領土非被反軸心所佔，即爲法西斯共和政府所轄，故彼等無從返國義新聞記者已獲　繼續前赴義國而外交人員則被留於巴伐里亞</p>
<p>斯摩倫斯克前綫劇戰進行中　南路德軍採避離戰略</p>
<p>柏林二十二日中　社電　海通社訊：現在東綫戰事之焦點，仍在斯摩倫斯克區，蘇軍使用大量之大砲及坦克，對德軍之防禦陣地猛烈進攻，又欲使用鉗形之攻勢，蘇軍企圖自南面包圍該她。在莫斯科斯摩倫斯克公路之北，蘇軍正向該城防綫之北前進，德軍反攻獲有勝利。東綫南部天氣已趨良好，故蘇軍即將再度展開攻勢，並以新銳之後備機械化部隊參加。沿亞索夫海北岸蘇軍壓力尤見加强，蘇軍之目的顯欲攻抵聶拍河套及克黑米亞。德軍以巧妙之作戰，切斯蘇軍之前進軍隊與後方之連絡，蘇軍現被陰於梅立托普爾（Melitopol）及柴普魯基（Zaporoiye）之東數公里地點。蘇軍於陣地後集中其兵力，此足顯示蘇軍指揮部即將恹復攻勢。稍北方面，蘇軍　聶伯比托羅夫斯克前進者，僅獲微少之成就，但德軍仍　取彈性戰略，故其損失甚微。在波爾太伐區堅强之德軍防禦堡壘，能抵抗至數星期之久，至星期一日其情勢無甚變化。奈秦（Niejin日）之東南，蘇軍對基輔方面之壓迫，似有减弱之象微，但於四北方面蘇軍增加壓力，以圖接近契尼柯失（Chernigov），使能逮到聶伯河之中部之山嶺區域，在此地劇戰正在進行中。白里安斯克之西及羅斯托夫之東，因德軍之避離運動，故蘇軍乃獲得前進，此區蘇軍僅獲輕微之成就。</p>
<h3>强化統制經濟　發揮國府政治力量　青木大東亞相對日本記者談話</h3>
<p>巴特里奧政權的無條件投降，顯然是忽視道義　神，人神所不容的倒戈行爲，所幸墨索里尼統帥已被救出，現柱德國的歐洲要塞、漸次堅固，日本柱東亞的必勝不敗勢　，愈益鞏固，帝國政府乃向中外表明態度；「與意志　歐洲盟邦各國國民及大東亞各國家，各民族的提携，漸見密切，始終在求擊減宿敵英美。」我們唯有兆僚齊心，發揮最大戰力，控制覬　北邊的　方　動，克服四南太平洋的劇戰、粉碎敵方反攻緬甸企圖，爭取最後勝利，興大東亞各民族駢肩前進，是以、對於大東亞的一切、尤其是盟邦中國的動向如何？我們不得不加以關心、青木大東亞相應本報記者之請、關於中國問題的現狀，披　所　如次、以下即本報記者與青太大臣的一問一答：</p>
<p>問：爲完成大東亞戰爭，今後大束亞的團結更爲重大·衆皆以爲解決中國問題是當前各問　的中心、關於此點，請發高論。</p>
<p>援助中國獨立自主</p>
<p>答：由於所謂大東亞的團結、解決中國問　的重要性更大，今後我們必須　更大的努力。政府對華政策的目標、誠如騰次昭示於整明中者，最注重的就是援助中華民國完成獨立自主。余今次赴華視察實情，目擊種　措施。</p>
<p>其一，就是政府機構的調整，其顯著者爲最高國防會議的設立，這好像是具有戰時內閣性質的組織。在國防會議上、可以迅即決定重要國策，而强力推行，在國防會議中，　北政委會之代表亦參與其問。比他如全國經濟委員會，新遝促進會等之經濟施策或國民精神總動員方面的機構及其運用，比較以前有顯著的進步。還有一點，較我在華當時所見有顯著不同者：就是加强國府對經濟統制的地位，過去許多經濟統制事宜，因爲我方軍事上的必要而予以管理，但是現在　不多全部移交國府自行辦理，尤其是關於物價，物資的統制，以全國商統會爲中心，實行民問業者的自治統制，政府站在監督指導的地位，以官民協力的統制方式或中日協力的形式來進行。這一點我以爲在今後發揮國府政治之上，也能關一新途徑。</p>
<p>問：國府政治力，聞已深入民問各地、那末對於上海，究竟普遍到何種程度呢？換句話說，現在國民政府已否把握了上海妮？動員上海民族資本而使其　加中國的經濟建，有沒有可能呢？</p>
<p>答：接收上海租界，是對華重要政策之一，看到現柱靑天白日旅飄揚的情形，實不勝今昔之感，所以收囘租界，可以認爲孫文先生革命以來國民目的已經達到。因之，一般識者頗能理解收囘租界對於中國獨立自主上的意義，然而也有人不十分明暸它在國家的重要性，吾人實不勝遺憾。</p>
<p>我以爲，這是上海的人們多年來脫却了國家的統治，完全是過慣了個人本　的生活所致，尤其是現在因爲物價關係，大家鬧着經濟問題，把目光移轉到日常生活問題上去了，不免疏忽了國家重要問題的意義。</p>
<p>但是經濟問題，也將漸次安定，况且今日之下，雖世界任何各地的人們，都脫不了國家的統制，設能明乎此點，則上海人們，自然會明白解決租界問題的眞正意義了。</p>
<p>問：關於中國的物價問題、其根本原因，或許是通貨不安，或爲上海財界的對戰爭的傍觀態度，關於這一點，願聞宏論。</p>
<p>物價問題癥結所在</p>
<p>答：中國的物價問題，一而當然是物的方面，另一面當然是在於運貨的方面。所謂上海這一個地位，過去是外國的價廉物品集中點，亦即是東四各國自由輸入物　的區域，但是，英美凍結資金，接着大東亞戰爭爆發，進出貨大非昔比，這就物價方面觀之，是物價　貴的最大原因，至論國內生產，有一部份因爲戰塲的關係，治安未定，生產力受了阻礙，又因爲交通，運輪的關係，同時　銷，配給等等的拘東，故而不能圓滑進行，由於種種戰時下所難免的原因，這就是物資不足的一大原因，而物資的採辦尤其是物價統制，不能像日本一般的有效，也都是物資不足的原因，所以，無論如何，除將現存的物資合理配給，活用之外，並須增加農業生產，一掃食糧問題的不安心理，同時在上海及共他各處促進生活必需品的生產工業、活用原料豐富的中國生產力，培植物資供給的絕對量，着重這一點做去，日本也來協力推進解決此項問題，才是最重要的事情。當然，另一方而還要隨時獎　蓄，加强經濟統制，必須根本的增產，促進採銷圓滑，這都必須放在對　中心的。</p>
<p>問：在上海方面，最近實行收買棉紗棉布，此項措置，就物資方面或通貨方面而論，人家都認爲是爲了要壓平物價上昇的措置，不　嗣後，上海物價，究竟有漸次低落的傾向否？</p>
<p>協力收買棉紗棉布</p>
<p>答：國府於八月上旬實行收買上海的棉紗棉布，我國也協力華方政策而收買日本方面的棉紗棉布這就是國府强力實施的物價政策與物資對策，也就是中日經濟協力的典型，關於這一點，不但是上海方面，大部份的國民都歡迎國民政府的英斷，此可謂係國民政府發揮政冶力的　大成功，其對物價之影響尤多，不特棉紗棉布傾跌至收買標準價格，即其他物價，除一部份外，亦都低落，近上海物價，差不多步步上漲，但因措置而漲風頓止，反動轉跌，這柱上海經濟界是空前的。</p>
<p>此項收買的棉紗棉布，今後歸國府統制，如能用它來收買農　物及其他必要物資，則對於採辦物資及統制物價上，必能發揮更大的效果。</p>
<p>問：再就安定民生，把握人心方面觀之，其最重要的·是食糧問題。華中食糧大槪可以自給自足，華北食糧一向被視爲困難請以食糧問題爲中心，略談華北的情勞。</p>
<p>華北力謀食糧增產</p>
<p>答：食糧問題，就所謂安定民心的政治方面，或物價問題，以及推行各種業計劃的見地而論，確屬重大。華北本來是非向他處辦通食糧補助不可的地方，這是有歴來的統計可資調查，因此，華北政委會當局及日本方面，也竭一切量來增產食糧，曾經着經濟研究機關，根本研究華北的食糧增產對策，以協力華方施策，然而在短期問娶做到自給自足，尙非易事，一方面尙增加棉花等生產的必要，目前的對策就是把不足之數由各方面來補給，辦法歸中國方面去想，我國從　協力（企　：譯自九月十七日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>言評　新商人道德</h3>
<p>「商業道德」，一個名名　·早為吾人所　聞了，在戰時民生凋　之秋，商業道德，尤為維持社會福利，成全大眾生活的一條孔道，所以名爲新商人道德」。凡　價，重息，　衡，以至樣奇計嬴，專利壟斷，居間受酬，無一不是新商人道德的反面，爲戰時商人所當特別避免的。</p>
<p>因為我們不能不時常懷疑於米店售米的管與量是否準確，煤球商限制市民購買戰額是否有必要，　　店所派得的鉅績食糖是否大半供銷黑市，其所售糖食的價格是否合理，商店與菜塲所用之度量衡器是否合於標準，日用品商店之無貨應市，是否別有居心，因為我們鑒於諸如此類的一切與一切，都為商人道德所繫，而與民眾生活具有切膚關係者。所以我們竭力主張戰時新商人道德的提倡。</p>
<p>構成新商人道德的基本要素為　以先公後私為其理念，　以忠於職位為其責任、　以經營合理化為共原則。先公後私則不至於損人利己（例如以配給之物品，供銷於黑市）：忠於職位，則不至於假公濟私（例如名為開設商店，實為國持貨品）；經營合理化則不至於不能發揮其經濟的，社會的機能，就是生產的，配給的能力（例如有料不製，有貨不售。）</p>
<p>總之一句話，金錢是商人的物質資本，道德是商人的精神資水；必　商人的道德觀念，不為金錢觀念所蒙蔽，則社會福利問題，大眾生活問題，解決過半了，尤其是戰時的大衆生活。</p>
<h3>各業商號要求公會　請配給原料　籌商有效辦法維持營業</h3>

<p>增加成本</p>
<p>亦非久計，因是紛紛要求，予以迅速轉　當局，呈請各該會員同　目前處境狀況，准予將過去曾經核准配給之原料，如經　糖油食　芝蔴赤豆菜豆黃豆等，以便正常製貨，以利市銷，而維營業。茲各業公會負資人鑒於會員同榮所呈各節，尚屬事實，并為謀</p>
<p>同業福利</p>
<p>起見，　即轉呈關係當局，予以迅即配給原料，否則非特會晨商號，將無法營業，抑且市民亦受影響，聞有少圓滿，又悉，本市切　　　製熱食業茶食業及强花業等同業公會，晚近曾經迭次召開　　理監會義</p>
<p>磋商關於增進同業福利事宜，一面　勸會員同業，切產遵守　賣業規，及與公會密切聯繫，以便劃一步驟，福利推進。</p>

<h3>抄查日見嚴厲</h3>
<p>各當局為謀物資正常供應，及杜絕非法操縱　　起見，曾經採取斷然措置，凡任何人携運主要或進主要物品，必須經過　　之嚴密抄查，及出示關係方面頒給之搬出移動證書，否則作為非法偷運論，沒收充公，並將人物一併帶往究辦。昨據上海社記者探悉，晚近各當局對於抄查工作，愈形嚴格，除在各水陸碼頭附近遣派大批警探負責檢查往返旅客行李外，一面並在馬路衝要，佈置警探，注意行人携帶之笨重包裹及物資，同時嚴禁携帶笨重物件，搭乘電車或汽，車，以免偷運物資出境。故凡市民向商店添辦物品，應向其素給發票，以便途次軍警查詢時有所證明。</p>
<h3>萌芽時代的　托兒所運動（續）</h3>
<p>聯婦托兒所</p>
<p>威海衛路六三八號（慕爾　路四）中華基督教女靑年會裹，附設着「職業婦女托兒所」她和上海托兒所是雙生的姊妹組織。原來卞女士等在廿九年發起在上海創辦托兒所事　之時，發起人之問曾　生兩種不間的主張，一方面認為替勞苦大眾服務有最重大的意義與必要·所以主張辦完全免費的托兒所，只收勞工的子女，另一方而以為當前對托兒所最感迫急需要的是一般職業婦女，不一定是女工，她們在工商各界工作，甚至對社會團家服務，急須減輕她們對子女的負擔。結果，女青年會的當局，認為兩者可以同時合作試辦。後來卞煦孫女士主持上海托兒所，同時另推該會幹事陳善明女士主辦職業婦女托兒所。她的宗旨是：　謀兒童本身幸福，　適應職業婦女需要，　灌輸父母育兒常識，　培養保育人才，　提倡托兒所運動。初辦時規定收容名額為五于名，入所的資格為：）自二足歲至四足歲，能自由行走者、二·母親有職業或事業而無　管教小孩者，三，經醫生檢查體格而無傳染病　。入所的手續是：一、經人介紹，詳填報名單，二，檢查體格，三，錄取後填且保說書。當時只收　讀生，規定上午八時半入所，下午五時出所，至三十年秋，接受一般家長的要求，才收容住宿生。後來又附設幼稚間，事　日趨發達。不過由於房舍和經費的限制·始終朱能實現她們原來的理想。現有幼稚生共三十名，計四至六歲的十四人，一至四歲　十六人，住宿生共四十二名，計四至六歲的二十人，二至四歲的二十二人。</p>
<p>上午九時，主任教師戴　真女士已在二樓課堂裹教導孩子們唱歌，這是高級幼稚班，幾十個孩子團坐成一圓圈，都是高高興興。另外幾個教室裹，小孩子們在高昌明教師等指導着。孩子們除了教師之外。還有九位熱烈的保姆愛撫着。辦公桌旁邊的黑板上記明今天的勝食：早膳，拌豆腐，白粥；中膳，炒　毛菜，猪肝洋山芋泥，靑菜毛豆，洋山芋湯。午點，生梨，晚膳，猪肝，靑菜粥·經濟·清潔和營養價值，都要顧到、眞是煞費苦心！</p>
<p>三樓是孩子們的宿會，休息室和游戲塲。雖然房間不大，幾乎運每一方尺的地面都被好好的利用了，但布置得不覺十分擁擠，每一張矮脚木床上都有白色的警潔的被褥。洗臉室，浴室，醫藥設備，雖說且體而機，可是總　完備了，職婦托兒所的孩子們是我們最幸福的一代，正像該所壁上一幅大　所標明的：向火陽！向光明！我們在集體生活中長大」！</p>
<p>今日與明日</p>
<p>現在上海的托的所，就只有女青年脅主辦的還兩個。其中職業婦女托兒所雖然酌最收費，自本年八月起的每月計教育費、保育費，膳費，點心費，宿費，醫藥費，文具及玩　費，雜費等，全日生總數一百三十元，全日生用中膳二百五十元，寄宿生四百五十元，但實際上由於一般職業婦女及薪水生活者收入太少，能繳令費的很少。所以仍是服務性質，每月由女靑年會補貼，至少得一萬餘元，今後還有日趨困難之虞。至於上海托兒所，旣然完全不收費，水年全年預算原定二十三萬元，由女靑年會撥給七萬元。但實際物價高漲驚人，預算不　甚　，全靠各界捐助。自去冬開始勸募，至今春勸募成績，約及十萬元。一月間請求上海市貧病救濟協會補助，由委員姚惠象先生前往調查。認為該所收容的孩童多爲貧苦工人子女及無人撫養的孤兒，為一富有續極性的慈　機關，適合補助條件。後　該會決定自二月起每月補助四干元，至十月止，共二萬四千千元。八月問又一次補助二萬四千元。對托兒所運動起了推動的作用。</p>
<p>經費以外·房舍與人材、是托兒所當前兩大困難。上海托兒所的房舍，固然頗合理想，而且還有擴充收容名額的可能。每月房租雖達千元之鉅，但比較的還不能說奇昂。不過房東久有收回之意，幸　然心者的婉商，而房東也了解協助托兒所的慈善意義，在回租一倍的條件下，暫允　　借用，倘能從此不再加租或促選，則對於托兒所事業前途，實有重大助益。職業婦女托兒所的房舍，則尚嫁過於狹隘，如得較大房舍，必更有助於事業的發展。</p>
<p>托兒所是新的社會事業，她需要有遠見，有熱心，有榖力和專門技能人才，茹苦含辛，鍥而不捨，努力服務，這種人才，求之今日，尚不易得，特別是因為輕費太拮据薪金太菲薄，服務者的本人縱抱着犧牲服務的決心而來，而且多數是基督教徒，絕對不在物實報酬上計策，但如果有着家庭的負擔，而且甚至本身的生活也慮不足維持，那就不能奇怪於該所保姆工役們的流動性太大了。</p>
<p>上海女靑年會主辦的兩個托見所，已替上海托兒所運動開關一條出路，並且證明了社會對於托兒所之迫切需要，證明了只要肯認眞辦，一定辦得好。不過究竟因為經費和人才缺乏，其事業範圍尚有檢大限制，事業前途尚有不少阻碍。地們的事業，還只能滿足社會需要的一小部分。為了改造幼兒教養制度培養身心健全的小國民，為了解放婦女使能多多努力於社會國家的事樂，中國的托兒所運動一定要普遍展開，上海更應為全國托兒所運動的基點。（完）</p>

<p>譯論</p>
<h3>課稅權的實施</h3>
<p>交還租界以後，撤廢治外法權，為　華新政　的重要一環，其中關於課稅權一項，已於上次移　，現定於十月一日起實施。查此事係根據本年七月三十一日締結之移讓課稅權條約，九月十日由國府向日方作第一次通知，於九月二十日由中日兩國發表官報公告。我們覺得，課稅權之移讓，實為當然的措置，回顧本年初的日本對罪新政策，或再迫溯以前最早揭　於近衛聲明內的方針，就可以知道這是既定的國策；現在實現撤廢治外法權，不必說，是一種榮高道義精神的表現。</p>
<p>根據九月十日的第一次通知，實施的課稅範圍，關於中央稅者。(所得稅除外）占大部份，地方稅占一部份，這自八月一日起，已經以捐贈的形式繳與國府，實除上日僑的負擔和現在殆無變更。恐怕在今後中日雙方當局更將折衝，接洽，力避雙重負擔的犧牲，務　日僑勿感到意外的衝動。這一點雖然在華日僑充分安心，但是希望日僑要充分認識對華道義政策的眞義，俾使國策能澈底實行。對華新政策，不僅是政府與教府間的一紙條約和聲明所能踐行的，主要者還須賴國民的實踐。由此而論。則在華僑胞所負的任務畢何等重大。</p>
<p>憑國府現在的政治力，當然不能期待如日本一般的徵稅。旣是既已以强化國府為根本國策，則與其　待聲　稅制及徵稅方法完備，還是早些移讓課稅權，這才是強化國府的最好方法。遵照今從第二次，第三次的通知，在不久實施全面課稅的塲合。恐怕會發生意外的誤解和衝突，或許會透　華方制度機權的缺陷。但是，假使遇到這種事　就要實難，那就不是大國國民的陶襟了，我們始終要以寬容的精神進以忠告，促其反省改進，必須如此，方不失為積極協力糾正華方缺點的正當態度。</p>
<p>同時，我們有不得不希翼於國府者，願國府趁此時機，調整稅制發備與徵稅方法，以求其合理化，此為近代國家所不可缺的前提條件、在華僑胞，對於移讓課稅權，並無若何反對，即對於未來負担的變動，亦已充分覺悟。所希望者，就是公正的負担，但願此項負担國府能合理適當的運用。因課稅權的移讓而產生的其他義務，國府當局能否完全做到，對於撤廢其他治外法權亦有極大的影響。我們不得不於此盼望國府當局者的奮發。（企靑：。譯自九月二十一日大陸新報)</p>

<h3>巴陀里奧投降　日德輔心毫無動搖</h3>
<p>— 白鳥敏夫</p>
<p>義大利巴陀里奧政權，和英美綺結休戰條約，背叛日德義三國同　及不軍　　和條約，向敵軍無條件舉手投降。　　　的政　以來以至今日的事態，正在我們的意料之中。我們亳不失驚、日德軸心，斷無　　動搖。—前駐義大使·並在締結三國同盟時直接當軸　外交之衝和　義二國首腦部有很多友人的大政　贊會總務白鳥敏夫氏，九日晨論「退出戰綫的義大利」如次，要求我們　定信念以爲應付。</p>
<p>北義防衛金湯之固</p>
<p>義大利現在日繼不顧三國條約，遠反不單獨媾和條約。在德國方而，因爲同盟關係而與之駢屑作戰，因義大利的要求而派遣軍隊，所以絕不會以休戰為理由而從義大利撤過軍隊。且又不致於接受這穩撤軍的要求。德軍以為無論在任何塲合，不能不採軍事上必要的處置。總之，北義方面的防衛，實有金城湯池之固，故從事事上看來，義大利的退出，不成為大問題。這半年以來，德國方面常這樣說。</p>
<p>從純軍事的見地考察起來，德國靑願切新總手鎛脚的累墜　西，墨索里尼一下野。此次的事悄就已經如此決定。</p>
<p>墨案尼下野了，柄政二十年的法西斯被排斥了，怎樣還能繼續戰爭呢？三國同盟是墨素里尼的政策，是法西斯的政策，這政策被淸算以後，今日的脫離戰綫，乃是當然發生的事情。</p>
<p>德法關係將更密切</p>
<p>如上所述、從純軍事的見地來看，那不算什麼大事。義大利的國力，借邱吉田的話說，德中的十分之一也沒有。為了幫助沒有戰爭物資，國力不足的義大利，德國以前柴已担起非常的負担，並貸與了精銳的武器，每月須得用汽車送百萬噸煤，實是很費力的覺助。</p>
<p>這　脫來，在德國方面，縮短戰綫的效果，不單在戰綫方面，即在如次關點也有很大的意義。以下，從政治上的見地來　，敵方在全世界散布雜心方而危殆的印象。　我不以為然。義大利或許從此喪失，但可斷　德法之間因此更見進步。德法在今日也已相常融洽，而妨害德法關係者，乃因義大利的存在。依我看來，今後德法的融洽接近，可更迅速進展。而且德國也很注力於此。喪失了義大利而德法更見接近，所以在政治上說，德國並不像反軸心國所說那樣不利。土耳其·四班牙的態廣、或巴爾幹　小國的態度上，或許稍有動搖，但　之這量德國的兵力—軍事力的問題，把持力的問題。在此方面，我相信是不成問題的。</p>
<p>西班牙，土耳其，考察這三四年間的各種情勢，今日所取的態度，實是唯一的可能的態度，所以今後不政有很大的變化。</p>
<p>所以從政治的見地上看，也沒有如敵方所想的那樣重大的影響。</p>
<p>德義兩國國情不同</p>
<p>在我國民眾方面，見到義大利的退出，認為軸心方面不利，那是全然不知道德國與義大利國情的話。這二個國家的國民、國力，物資，歷史，一切的一切，都全然不同。國內有很多親英美派的義大利，削除法四斯黨的軍權，這也是敵卞的策略。</p>
<p>德國如歷史所一不，是非常偉大的國家，以前的戰爭和今日的戰爭比較起來，以前的戰爭·條件非常惡劣，但究也對峙四年，頑强戰鬥，最後因國內崩潰而戰政。在今日、國內的異己分子已一掃而空，在物資方面，也不被食糧所困，而且德國民眾都知道此次如其失敗，一切都完了。所以如把義大利和德國同樣考察，費是大差。</p>
<p>假使德國而竟至於戰敗，那時候蘇聯和英國也將筋疲力盡而隨之共倒吧！我絕對不以為德國曾失敗的，即使失敗，相信英美也一定一同失敗。最後說到日本、日本在於主位，用自力而戰的覺悟，目前實是必要的。日本和德國如其駢肩作戰到底，我方有着不敗的態勞，勝利必在於　。</p>
<p>歐州戰綫不須悲觀</p>
<p>巴陀里與的戰獨媾點也不須悲觀，對於最後勝利的　察已依然可靠如故。不過在這時候，戰爭的中心。將在於日本。我們不應忘能日。這點日曬與德國實在都很堅靱可恃。今年和來年，時局的演變，將爲最激烈且嚴重的時候，我們如其能勉渡此難關，則此後所向披靡疾。（　：　自九月十一日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>為一般小本經營棉　紗布者請命</h3>
<p>— 陳非非</p>
<p>自政府實施全面收買棉紗布以來·至今已屆四旬，影響所及，各界無不大起波動，蓋此次實施收買施之於一般專以囤積居奇坐享厚利之暴發戶實不為過，惟施之於一般依正規經營棉紗布為生活之小本經紀者，未免太酷，理應分別處置，不該等量齊觀，須知囤積棉紗布居奇圖利者固屬不少，但經營綿紗布以求生活者亦不在少數；今一概施以全面收買之處分，實欠公平；且恐影響整個金融和社會安　，望我賢明政府當局應在實施收買原則下及無礙於大東亞戰爭之戰時經濟者，盡力拯救一般經營棉紗布之小資商、茲將最簡易之側面嗚補戰辦法試述於下：</p>
<p>一般投機國積者之最大目標為棉紗，白坯布（如龍頭細布），加工幣理大路貨（如四君子嗶嘰，士林藍布……）等之廠單及倉庫棧單，因取其數量多而手續簡易也，至於加工棉布中之本廠綫呢（即改良土布）種類繁多，品質不一，向不被囤積者所注目，經營範圍亦遠不及上列各貨之廣泛·從業者均為小本經營，平時均以規貨買賣，價格上下亦　微小，實無投機囤積可言：故於此次實施收買中，應予以相當區別。</p>
<p>政府當局於付款條文中，對於一般小本經營者，亦應予以救濟：因上述小營商其資金大多短絀、或向銀錢業告貸，或以貨物做抵押借款而費週轉；今概以收買後三個月給以四分之一標金、試問大結束之期為時不過四閱月，所欠外界之借款及押款將如何理償？所有之棉紗布旣已申請出賣於政府，不特無產可破；抑且連生活費無着，即銀錢業亦將因紗布業之不理償欠款而擱淺，整個金融將因之動搖，前途將至不堪股想，对大東亞戰爭亦有不利影響；故求政府當局在避免通貨膨賬之原則下，酌量扶助一般棉紗布小賣商，及金副業；例如由政府命令各棉紗布商及銀錢業限令到三日內將紗布商號所欠銀錢業之放款與押款雙方摘實呈報，兩相對照後再派員一度檢查，倘所報不虛，准其將所負之債務發額改給以儲備銀行即期匯劃有單，以便淸償債務，其　之款仍按照法定期間發還之；如此一般小賣商縱不能起死同生，亦是以死而無累·即金融業亦賴以維持而於政府之通貨政策絕無妨礙，實一舉而敬善備焉。</p>
<p>語云：民為邦本，本固邦寗，望政府本此原則，應稍稍顧及一般小賣商之艱難，酌量考慮其側面救濟辦法·誠屬大幸矣。</p>

<h3>培養難童的　幼幼敎養院根况</h3>
<p>— 醫頑</p>
<p>幼幼教養院是一所生氣蓬勃的教養機關，來歷是五年前難民收容所裹送去無家的難童，院內工作分總務·教導，生產三處分別執行，總務下又設文書，會計，給養，醫務，保管各股；生產處現分藤工，結網二部鬥，敎　採取工讀制，訓導從人恪感化入手。</p>
<p>該院對於兒童的個性發展及謀生技能，都有很嚴愼的計劃，並且已獲得到良好的成果。在街頭巷角下層社會裹染了惡劣習慣的兒童，在院內都一一加以改正，另一方面除了教學普通的教科書外，更重視到兒童的個性及興趣，適應他們各自的本能而從旁加以正確的指示</p>
<p>為顧慮到兒童出院後的謀生問題，在學科中特別加了職業訓練課程所，以每屆畢業生之就職技能都具有根基，而社會上熱心人士也能常常提拔院生進入某些進步機關，及工商界服務。</p>
<p>院內設有閱　室，寫作室，棋子室及台球室等，兒童”以自動地看書寫作或游戲，都很有秩序和紀律，這決不是一朝一夕教資所能過到的。</p>
<p>自大东亚戰事勃发後，因受到物價服漲的苦痛，食糧大感不足，院方即有遷鄕之想，後覓得崑山徐公橋鎭農村改通發　址　、因其寬敝清淨，宜耕宜　，遂於本年一月由教師三人率領百餘兒童遷鄉，設立「徐公橋幼幼分院」，在這裏不禁令人憶起馳名全國新安旅行團的母校新安小校。這些兒童決不會再是五榖不分的書呆子了·</p>
<p>幼幼教　院的經農，總計總院及分院兩處開支，每月需四萬多元，鑑於物價　漲，這數目也不斷的提高，我們知道該教養院是完全依靠徵募來的捐用都極困縱，架悟計會　心人士，必不忍見此良好的教　機關中途停頓，而能羣策羣力，共同扶植。的兒童，國家也要感謝你們呢。</p>

<h3>街童收養問題</h3>
<p>— 夢騮</p>
<p>街頭流浪兒童的收養、在各種社會慈善事業中、實應從速舉辦，這不　可使市容整肅淸潔，並且在健康保障上，農業增產上，失業救濟上，犯罪防止上及民眾教育上，都是極有意義的。爰將所見各點列舉如左：</p>
<p>機關　籌設官民合辦的善團承辦其事，如此則集患廣益、足資號召。</p>
<p>經費　共經發不宜向民間專捐、完全應由市　負担，藉以堅强市民對於政府的信仰。若因規模過大有所不足，再向民間然心公益人士勸募不過，</p>
<p>地點　宜一律收容於鄉間，使之幫助農田工作，習慣農村生活、學得農業技能，如慮上海近郊鄉間現無房屋可容多數兒童，則不妨臨時建蓋茅屋，略如事　時上海收容難民的辦法，</p>
<p>給　　其一切衣舍住居等，務勿優於農家兒童。例如鞋機在中國農家絕不常用、則所收兒童不必常用桂襪，食糧方面，亦可以雜糧爲主等等，總之，在不書健康發育的節圍內，對於所收兒童的給養，宜儘量節約，務使兒童習慣勤儉的農村生活。</p>
<p>管教　兒童的收容，應分爲兩種，一種為對於領養兒童的管理，期滿可由其親屬領同；另一種為街頭流浪兒童的管理，管教方法，自亦應分為兩種，對於後者，應施特種感化教育、力改其街頭游浮習氣，樂於生產工作，適量的勞動之外，並應從勞動中施以教育、以逐漸養成農業及他方面的專門人材。</p>
<p>衛生　農民多患竊痢，紅眼　疾等症，這是缺乏衛生條件的弊害。所以對於傳染病的預防及治療，也是在鄉問的兒童收養機關所應注意的。</p>

<h3>Consultation on Gauze Rationing Procedures</h3>
<p>On the 21st of this month, we, under the title "What Happens After Gauze is Purchased?", will present some principles based on various opinions regarding gauze rationing methods, hoping that the authorities will carefully consider them when planning the methods. Among them, the third point concerns the rationing procedure. We advocate that, in principle, the layers of passage should be reduced, because more layers mean more complicated procedures, longer time, and greater costs, which will result in time and economic losses for the recipients. Under this principle, we believe that the "Federation" level can be omitted for quicker action, and the "Wholesaler" level is for profit-sharing, redundant, and unnecessary. Our position is based on the perspective of reducing the consumption burden and providing common benefits to the majority of recipients. Of course, the interests of a few wholesalers cannot be taken into account. If there is another way that does not significantly affect the burden on consumers, while taking into account the legitimate profits of legitimate wholesalers in the past, allowing them to continue to exist during the transition period and maintain the livelihood of their entire industry, a certain leader of the gauze industry has sent a letter expressing his opinion on this issue, which is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>"...However, the third item needs to be discussed. The original intention advocates that the fewer layers in the rationing process, the better. The theory is undoubtedly correct. However, the facts also need to be taken into account. The Federation is an organization jointly established by producers and consumers. When the Ministry of Industry and Commerce formulated regulations, adding such an organization aimed to allow trade associations of two, three, or four types to negotiate and decide on disputes over the supply and demand of one or more items through the council of the association. This type of situation is particularly necessary in other counties, but the Federation should not collect handling fees when distributing materials to avoid exploitation. It should be clearly stipulated in the regulations to prevent malpractices. Whether wholesalers should exist is equivalent to whether Japanese trading companies engaged in gauze business should exist. Currently, there are more than 600 members of the Yarn Merchant Trade Association and more than 2,600 members of the Cloth Merchant Trade Association. If all these merchants are eliminated, the trade associations will be virtually dissolved. The Ministry intends that wholesalers who were normally engaged in gauze business before the incident, who have always supplied goods to factories or retail stores, and who have account books and receipts to prove it, should be allowed to continue their business. Even newly established similar merchants after the incident should be allowed to exist. If they are merchants engaged in hoarding and speculation, they should be reported by the trade association and their licenses revoked. This is the only way to show fairness. Now, cotton yarn is purchased by the government at a fixed price of 10,000 yuan from the black market price of 30,000 yuan. After adding the legitimate profit of wholesalers, the burden on the general public can be said to be minimal. At the same time, allowing hundreds of thousands of people (taking Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces into account) to avoid freezing and starvation is also a good intention of the government to care for the hardships of the people."</p>
<p>Regarding the opinions in the letter, with the industry's experience and consideration of the facts, they are also sufficient for the authorities to consider. The center of our previous advocacy was to "save time" and "reduce the burden." Therefore, taking the facts into account must be based on the premise of not violating these two principles in order to be a reasonable "consideration."</p>
<h3>After Reading Minister Aoki's Interview</h3>
<p>Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki previously came to our country to hold talks with the National Government authorities and to investigate the implementation of the new policy towards China, and returned to Japan via North China and Manchukuo. Later, he had an interview with reporters from the Japan News Agency on the issue of controlled economy and political strengthening in China (the translation is published on the second page of today's newspaper). After reading it, we would like to express some thoughts as follows:</p>
<p>Minister Aoki reiterated that the goal of the policy towards China is to assist China's independence and freedom, and taking the return of concessions as an opportunity to implement cooperation. He regretted that some Chinese people have not been able to understand its importance, and criticized that some people in Shanghai have been detached from the rule of the country for many years and have become completely accustomed to a life of individualistic values. We have repeatedly stated that, from the standpoint of friendly countries, the focus of promoting the new policy towards China should be on "steadfast implementation" and "not seeking quick success," because the general character of Chinese people is to hold a not easily trusting attitude towards "new" things, and they will not immediately believe it without experiencing it for a considerable period of time. However, after believing it, they do not easily change. From the standpoint of the Chinese people, the practical process of Japan's new policy must be clearly investigated, and an attitude of acceptance and recognition should be expressed at any time to gradually eliminate past misunderstandings and gradually approach each other. This is what Chinese and Japanese people should deeply recognize today, when the relationship between the two countries is moving further forward.</p>
<p>Minister Aoki's observation on the issue of commodity prices in China is that the biggest reason is the lack of material resources. Therefore, he repeatedly mentioned the issue of increasing agricultural and industrial production, and expressed Japan's willingness to cooperate in promoting the solution of this issue. Minister Aoki is an economic expert and has served as the highest economic advisor to the National Government. His opinions on China's economy naturally deserve our attention. However, the point of increasing production has not only been mentioned repeatedly by us, but has also been established as a national policy by the government. However, no effect has yet been seen in the implementation. We pointed out yesterday that small industries and handicrafts in urban and rural areas should be given special support at present, because small and medium-sized industries are more dominant in Chinese society, and the production of small and medium-sized industries is very important for increasing material resources. Therefore, the government should lead the financial community to vigorously support, lend funds, guide technology, and connect transportation and sales, so as to allow them to fully develop freely. Here, we hope that friendly countries will assist us in solving difficult problems in fact.</p>
<p>Regarding the purchase of gauze, it is praised as a great success of the National Government's political power. If the purchased gauze can be exchanged for agricultural products and other necessary materials, it will surely have a greater effect on purchasing materials and controlling commodity prices. From the standpoint of China, we are ashamed of Minister Aoki's praise of political success, because the work is just beginning, and the distance to "success" is still far away. As for exchanging gauze for agricultural products, especially exchanging it for rice to solve the food problem in Shanghai, it is extremely necessary. In recent years, farmers have attached importance to physical objects and are unwilling to exchange goods for money. Therefore, exchanging gauze for food is easier.</p>
<p>Finally, we deeply feel that people in the ruling and opposition parties of friendly countries are very concerned about China's political and economic issues. However, concern is not enough. It is necessary to see through the hardships of the Chinese people and understand the psychology of the Chinese people in order to determine a cooperation policy centered on the Chinese people. Strengthening the power of the National Government certainly depends on Japan's cooperation; and strengthening the power of the people is even more necessary. Chinese and Japanese people who advocate cooperation to strive for the victory of Greater East Asia must fully understand this profound meaning!</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Announces to the People Decision to Strengthen Defense Posture Necessary Measures Have Been Taken for Administrative Operations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo broadcast to the entire Japanese nation from here on the 22nd via the Central Broadcasting Station, under the title "Announcement to Officials and Civilians," explaining the various measures taken by the government to strengthen the domestic situation under the decisive battle, and expecting Japanese officials and civilians to actively cooperate with this. The following is the general content of Prime Minister Tojo's speech: "Officials and civilians, since December 8th of the year before last, the 100 million Japanese people have paid tribute to the Great Edict and have risen up with great enthusiasm for self-preservation and self-defense. To date, whether in combat or construction, there has been tremendous progress. This is unprecedented in world history. Recalling that I have been ordered to form a cabinet for nearly two years, especially after the Greater East Asia War, I have devoted great efforts to strengthening the domestic situation in order to achieve the purpose of the Greater East Asia War. Recently, the United Kingdom and the United States have spared no sacrifice to try to reverse their decline in a short period of time, and have repeatedly launched counterattacks. The intensity of the war is deepening with each passing day. Now that we have entered a critical juncture, our 100 million people should renew their determination and concentrate their total strength on the completion of the war with resolute courage. At this critical time, unanimous uprising and loyalty are the source of our country's victory. The Japanese people have been able to eliminate all foreign enemies and maintain the glorious national polity for 3,000 years because of this unique characteristic. The government is now actively reforming the operation of national politics. In the future, the military and the cabinet will become more closely connected in order to vigorously wage war and promote external policies. Therefore, we are determined to thoroughly strengthen various aspects of the domestic situation and rapidly enhance combat power.</p>
<h3>Cooperation Between the Ruling and Opposition Parties Achieve the Goal</h3>
<p>The goals of the government in strengthening the domestic situation are as follows: Exerting the strength of officials and civilians to thoroughly implement the concept of the long-standing national polity; with the belief in certain victory, exert the entire national strength to seek military production, especially the rapid enhancement of aviation combat power; establish self-sufficiency in food supply between Japan and Manchuria. In order to achieve these goals, the government has adopted the following main points of the policies adopted this time: (A) Seeking the decisive battle of administrative operations. Necessary administrative measures have been taken. The simplification of administration has been implemented on a large scale. In view of the current stage of the war situation, the government is further reorganizing government offices, abolishing unnecessary measures, and implementing personnel reductions to strengthen the appropriateness of administrative operations. (B) In order to thoroughly mobilize national power, the government has adopted thorough measures for national mobilization in order to strengthen combat power in response to the current war situation, meet the requirements of operations, and increase production. The government has decided on the policy of national mobilization this time, and after implementing various emergency countermeasures, it will allow students to participate in combat. As for the main science and engineering departments, the government has made full arrangements for education. (C) In order to thoroughly strengthen the domestic defense posture, defending the homeland is mainly based on air defense. In order to ensure the safety of the capital and important cities, the government has decided to organize and relocate unnecessary government offices and schools from the capital and important cities to other places, implement the organization of various foreign corridors, unified control of organizations, and consolidated companies, and thoroughly reform their businesses according to the measures of the organizing office in order to reduce personnel and strengthen the simplification of the sea and land transportation and price allocation system, so as to contribute to the strengthening of combat power. The above-mentioned measures should be resolutely implemented, and their disadvantages should be thoroughly eliminated. This is the government's determination. The counterattack of the United Kingdom and the United States is becoming increasingly fierce, and the future of the occupation is becoming more and more complicated. However, this war is to eliminate the root of the disaster in East Asia, establish permanent peace in East Asia, and preserve the glory of the empire. Its victory always belongs to Japan. Although France and other countries are far away in Europe, the empire has repeatedly achieved the glory of mutual assistance through close cooperation. I hereby pray for the blessings of all allied countries, and at the same time, I express my greatest respect and gratitude to China, Manchuria, Thailand, Myanmar, and other countries in Greater East Asia for their cooperation with Japan, and wish their countries prosperity.</p>
<h3>The Content of the Outline of National Political Operation Includes Three Points</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) In view of the tense situation in the current world war, the Japanese government, in order to establish a winning posture, mobilized all military and civilian personnel, and devoted all human and material resources, and all policies, to move forward courageously in order to win the war.

<p>Resolutely Eliminate All Difficulties Strive for Rapid Realization</p>
<p>According to the Japanese government, the domestic posture strengthening policy established this time has great significance for the determination of administrative operations, the strengthening of national mobilization, and the strengthening of the domestic defense posture. The Japanese government also has an extraordinary determination to specifically realize this policy, eliminate all difficulties, and strive for rapid realization, and will not be bound by existing laws and budgets and resolutely take this measure. Therefore, each province is currently preparing implementation plans for each province based on the domestic posture strengthening policy this time, and will submit the original plan to the cabinet before the 26th of this month. After the cabinet's four chief officials' meeting has discussed it, it can be drafted into a complete case at the end of this month and submitted to the cabinet meeting for deliberation at the beginning of next month, and it will be implemented immediately after it is decided. The implementation of this case still requires various legal and budgetary measures, so the Japanese government is currently considering it, and will request to convene a temporary parliament when necessary.</p>
<h3>Japanese Women's Organization Labor Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese government recently decided to restrict men from taking up simple occupations that women can handle, and at the same time, in order to promote women's labor mobilization, it implemented the organization of women's labor volunteer corps. This project was approved by the Japanese cabinet and was announced by the Ministry of Health and Welfare on the afternoon of the 21st. The strengthening of women's labor mobilization is inevitable as the war continues. Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union have also implemented it one after another. US Secretary of Labor Perkins said that of the 4.5 million new workers added in the United States this year, women accounted for nearly 3 million. British Secretary of Labor Bevin also stated that 8.67 million women are currently directly or indirectly engaged in military-related work, of which 3.5 million are married or widows with children under the age of four. Therefore, although Japan has not yet reached the stage of requisitioning women, it is predicted that the situation of needing women will become increasingly urgent as the war heats up. Therefore, the Japanese government's implementation of organizing women's volunteer corps is based on the premise of requisitioning women. However, because it is automatically formed out of the people's loyalty, it is hoped that they will participate automatically as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force War Results Kunming Airport Bombed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2 p.m. on the 22nd that from September 10th to 20th, the Imperial Army Air Force in China bombed enemy air bases, ships, and military facilities in China for several consecutive days. The details are as follows: Four air raids on Jian'ou on September 10th, 11th, 12th, and 19th, Nanxiong on the 18th, Kunming South on the 20th, Bombing enemy aircraft fields, destroying their taxiways and military facilities, and fighting more than 20 enemy aircraft in the airspace over Kunming, destroying 18 of them (8 unconfirmed), and destroying more than 24 large aircraft parked in the field. Air raid on Badong, 80 kilometers northwest of Yichang on September 17th, near Wuzhou on the 19th, Bombing enemy ships, sinking and destroying 7 transport ships and many boats. Air raid on Ruyuan, 200 kilometers north of Guangzhou on September 18th, and Yunfu, about 120 kilometers northwest of Guangzhou on the 20th, Bombing enemy military facilities, and five places were set on fire in Yunfu. Our side suffered damage of 6 aircraft self-destructing during the attack on Kunming.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) The city of Kunming, which was severely bombed by the Japanese Army Air Force, is the base of the main force of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. The US Chennault Command is located there. There are two large aircraft repair shops on the outskirts of the city. With this as the center, there are also numerous aircraft fields in Mengzi, Yunnan, and Nanning. The enemy air force has repeatedly used these aircraft fields as the center and dispatched from Kunming. Attack Myanmar and even attack Vietnam. The target of the Japanese Air Force's attack this time was the aircraft field south of Kunming City. The repair shop is adjacent to the Chongqing Central Air Force Military Academy, with each side being 1,600 meters long and having four taxiways, the longest of which is 2,000 to several hundred meters long. The Japanese aircraft last bombed Kunming on April 29th. It is reported that on that day, because Commander Chennault was not present, the duties were represented by Brigadier General Bray, who was injured by Japanese aircraft.</p>
<p>Japanese Commander Talks About Kunming Air Combat</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) A certain base of the Japanese army, 22nd telegram, the commander of a certain fighter squadron led his aircraft to bomb Kunming on the 20th and engaged in a fierce battle with enemy fighters. The commander of the squadron shot down four enemy aircraft, giving the enemy air force a major blow. The commander of the squadron recently talked about the battle situation on that day, saying that when we reached the airspace over the enemy aircraft field, more than 20 enemy fighters had taken off to patrol. Three or four enemy aircraft formed a group and launched attacks from all around. The enemy took our bomber formation as the combat target, so we took the initiative to attack the enemy aircraft group at a high altitude. When the distance between the enemy and us was far, we never fired. If we were close, we would fire fiercely. Soon, four enemy aircraft wanted to take the opportunity to hinder our bomber formation from fighting, and I immediately soared into the sky and flew over the enemy aircraft. Shooting at the nose of the enemy aircraft, and then counterattacking downwards, repeatedly shooting at it, and in a short time the nose of the enemy aircraft tilted downwards at an angle of more than 40 degrees, spitting out sparks, and the body was surrounded by flames and fell down. At that time, the enemy aircraft was only 50 meters away from our aircraft, and the face of the enemy pilot could be faintly seen. Not long after, another enemy aircraft attacked. It was confirmed that the enemy aircraft was hit while the injured enemy aircraft was fleeing, or it was also shot down. At that time, an aircraft shot down several enemy aircraft near our aircraft, and the enemy aircraft still stubbornly resisted. Its attention was completely focused on our Nie bomber formation, regardless of our fighter squadron, which is enough to show the poor tactics and low quality of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Recent Trends of Chongqing US Air Force</h3>
<p>Japanese Army A certain base, 22nd (Central News Agency) Since the end of July, the elite units of the Japanese Air Force in China have launched a clever and valiant offensive, and the US Air Force has also struggled to counterattack. The two armies have repeatedly engaged in fierce air battles. Since September, the rainy season has passed, and the fighting has become increasingly fierce. The recent situation and trends of the US Air Force are briefly described as follows: The US Air Force, after being severely hit by the Japanese army, has recently attempted to launch a counterattack. Before August, the enemy's tactics were mainly based on guerrilla warfare due to fear of the Japanese army's fierce attacks. However, since the end of August, the enemy has been accumulating supplies on one hand and gradually adopting a counterattack posture on the other, and has begun to attack Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other places. The number of attacks has increased even more since September, and the enemy's tactics are no longer comparable to guerrilla warfare. They are constantly taking advantage of the gaps in the Japanese army's defensive positions and attempting to inflict damage on the Japanese army, but the Japanese army has taken the opportunity to counterattack and inflict heavy damage on the enemy. Moreover, when the enemy air force drops bombs, it is only innocent civilians who are injured due to fear or poor skills. The destruction of Japanese facilities and all attempts have completely failed, and the enemy's anxious situation of attacking has gradually become passive, and the bravery of the past is difficult to see again. The sharp decline in its morale is worthy of attention. This is because the enemy air force headquarters is eager to recover its reputation, so it issues attack orders regardless of the other party. On the other hand, the enemy pilots have gradually recognized the excellence of the Japanese Air Force. The pilots are skilled and brave in combat, so they have gradually shrunk back. They are forced to attack after being ordered, so once they encounter a fierce attack by Japanese aircraft, they immediately abandon their original intentions and flee in embarrassment, especially the enemy's B/40 aircraft, once encountering a fierce attack by a Japanese fighter squadron, immediately escapes to the nearby cloud layer. This is a common ugly behavior recently. When Japanese enemy aircraft air raid the Guangzhou area, the enemy fighters, because they were pursued by Japanese aircraft, hid under the belly of the bombers. The enemy aircraft, due to the attacks and interceptions by Japanese aircraft, has not only suffered aircraft losses, but also lost many pilots. Because this is a confirmed fact. The enemy is facing serious problems due to the difficulty in replenishing aircraft and the shortage of pilots. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently maintained the level of a total of 1,000 fighters and bombers due to a slight replenishment, but the Japanese aircraft's attacks often come as a surprise to the enemy and have repeatedly made great achievements, and the large-scale offensive to destroy the US Air Force is becoming increasingly fierce.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Launches Fierce Counterattack on Arundel Island</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) Arundel Island is located in the Solomon Islands, New Georgia Island, and Rendova Island. The elite garrison of the Japanese army on the island has been engaged in fierce battles with the numerically superior anti-Axis forces for several consecutive days, seizing the opportunity and launching fierce counterattacks.

The police station again summoned Tu Shuzhi for further questioning about the lost sugar, who stated that it was related to Tian Jingbo, the manager of the operations department of the Sugar Industry Association. As this case is of great concern to the livelihood of the capital's citizens, reporters have made inquiries with various relevant parties. It is reported that Tu Shuzhi and others illicitly altered the sugar, attempting to adulterate it for illegal profits. At the same time, they also unauthorizedly used officially rationed sugar, daring to disrupt the rationing system and deprive the citizens of the capital of their daily essential needs. The case is currently under active investigation. If this is indeed the case, then the authorities will undoubtedly apply the Wartime Criminal Special Law to severely punish them.</p>

Bomber squadrons fiercely bombed mobile enemy troops in southern Italy and attacked the enemy airfield on Sardinia, destroying ten enemy aircraft on the ground on other islands in the Mediterranean. The enemy has also claimed that Allied guerrilla units are extremely active along the Adriatic coast. In fact, the Adriatic coast is still secured by the German army. It is true that enemy guerrilla units have become more active recently since obtaining Italian weapons, and the German army is currently conducting large-scale operations against their main strongholds."</p>
<h3>New Fascist Leader To Be Elected</h3>
<p>Rome, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The leader of the Republican Fascist Party broadcast on Rome Radio yesterday that the leader of the party will be elected, not appointed as in the former Fascist regime.</p>
<h3>British Forces Gain Foothold at Amalfi; German Reinforcements Await</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – The German military authorities described the situation on the Italian front on the 21st as follows: "The British fleet in the Salerno area has only made partial bombardments against the German army. Under the cover of naval gun fire, the British army has gained several footholds on the Amalfi Peninsula and is continuously transferring reinforcements to land. It appears that the Allied forces are attacking Naples from the left flank because the Allied forces are being pressured by the British Eighth Army advancing north from Calabria and Apulia, so they are launching this action. A portion of General Montgomery's forces seems to have made contact with the Allied forces in the Eboli area, while its main force is still behind the front line. At the same time, according to an announcement from the Führer's headquarters on the 21st, German rear guard units are currently fighting east of Potenza and have repelled the British army, but the Allied forces are actively launching another large-scale offensive in that area, making a desperate advance. Therefore, the Allied forces are hastily reorganizing their units. At the same time, the German army has also been preparing its units and reinforcing reserve troops in the past few days, awaiting the enemy's attack in a well-defended position."</p>
<p>Details of the Great Battle in the Salerno Area</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Havas war correspondent Weber, who witnessed the battle on the Salerno front, provided a detailed report as follows: "On September 9th, the troops of the American Fifth Army, under General Clark, landed in the Salerno area. The battle is proceeding in the mountainous area along the coast, 1,000 meters above sea level. The intensity of the battle exceeds that of the ten-day defensive battle in the Catania area. Reports from the British 46th Infantry Division and British military commentators jointly declare that this is the most difficult operation. One day after the landing, Clark's troops were already in a dangerous state. German armored units launched a sudden counterattack, and the Allied line was extremely chaotic. Italian troops attempting to join the German army from the coast to reach the German line claimed that the Allied casualties were extremely heavy, stating that the entire area was covered with the corpses of British and American soldiers. This is the first time the British and Americans have used large-scale paratroopers, many of whom landed from the air in an attempt to occupy important mountain positions, hoping that they could emulate the bravery of the German paratroopers to disrupt the enemy and open up important transportation routes. A report from the 46th Division also acknowledged the Allied crisis, stating that many of the paratroopers who landed inland were annihilated by the newly equipped German army. In the twelve days of fighting in Salerno, two German divisions initially fought against two British and American divisions. After suffering heavy losses, the Allies immediately received reinforcements. Therefore, the enemy, with a force of seven divisions, fought against the two divisions of the German army. The German army, having learned of the contact with friendly forces from Calabria, achieved great success because the enemy originally wanted to cut them off. The enemy hoped for the fall of Naples eight days ago, but it is still firmly defended by the German army. The enemy's breakthroughs or flanking maneuvers have all failed. It is not yet possible to make a definitive statement as to whether the battle of Salerno is over, but the fact that the German army can evade the enemy's pursuit without being attacked has realized the German army's particularly ingenious tactical command in this area. However, it is highly possible that a further evacuation movement will be made on the Salerno front, centered on Naples, because its main purpose has now been completed: to re-establish contact with the main force from Calabria and inflict maximum losses on the enemy. The Allied losses in this area exceed 15,000."</p>
<h3>Berlin Unconcerned About Churchill's Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Political circles in Berlin are not paying attention to the speech given by British Prime Minister Churchill in the House of Commons yesterday. According to German diplomatic sources, Churchill's speech studiously avoided discussing military issues, lest it arouse the suspicion of impartial observers. The description of the Italian betrayal has a historical significance and is sufficient to cause the call made by Badoglio yesterday for Italians to lay down their arms and cease combat operations. Because the conclusion of the armistice agreement has reached this point, its mask has been exposed by Prime Minister Churchill. Churchill revealed in his speech that Badoglio's representatives had assured the British ambassador that Badoglio's government was indeed preparing to join the British and American side to fight against Germany. Churchill's remarks about Mussolini's rescue conveyed that Badoglio's plan to hand over Mussolini had failed. This caused great disappointment on the Allied side.</p>
<p>Details of Badoglio's Surrender</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to a London dispatch, British Prime Minister Churchill stated in a speech to the House of Commons yesterday: "After the Mussolini regime was overthrown, the Allied nations wanted to find a way to make the Italian authorities surrender unconditionally in the shortest possible time and reduce the Allied casualties to the minimum. Before long, the Badoglio government sent personnel to explore the situation in various ways, inquiring about the deficient conditions and explaining all the difficulties that surrender would entail. Although the Allied nations paid attention to the difficulties, they still insisted on unconditional surrender. On August 15, a certain general, an Italian diplomatic representative, visited the British Ambassador to Spain, Hoare, and presented credentials indicating that he had been fully authorized by Badoglio and informed him that the Badoglio government was prepared to join the British and American side after the Allied forces landed. At that time, Prime Minister Churchill was attending the Quebec Conference. After obtaining the consent of President Roosevelt and the British War Cabinet, it was decided that the Allied Mediterranean Command would dispatch British and American staff to Lisbon to meet with Badoglio's representative. On August 19, a meeting was held in Lisbon. One side stated that only unconditional surrender could be accepted, and the military conditions were also notified to the Italian representative. He did not object, but stated that the purpose of his visit was to discuss the issue of Italy joining the Allied side in combat. The Italian general took the conditions back to Rome and stated that he would return here on the 31st to submit the Badoglio government's reply to General Eisenhower. He was also informed that internal and political conditions would be raised. At the same time, another Italian general, accompanied by former British prisoner General Carton de Wiart, arrived, but this was not enough to affect the judgment of the situation. General Carton de Wiart also expressed his willingness to resume his status as a prisoner, but the Italian representative rejected this proposal. Thereupon, General Carton de Wiart was released with the British. On August 31, the Italian representative met again with Eisenhower's representative and stated that Badoglio was willing to accept the conditions without reservation. The declaration of peace was made at an appropriate time chosen by the Allied side, so as not to be taken advantage of by the Germans, that is, the armistice was declared only a moment before the Allied forces landed on Italian soil. The Allied nations, to the extent possible, will provide considerable assistance to this unfortunate government. Regarding the plan to hand over Mussolini, the British Prime Minister said: "This was one of the main conditions, but before the armistice or the Allied landing, it was impossible to implement the handover. The Allies had sufficient reason to believe that Mussolini was in a safe location and guarded by heavy troops. The handover of Mussolini seemed to be imminent one day, but the changes in the environment were beyond the control of the Allied nations. The Badoglio government's steps had originally been very careful. They did not use sufficient force to detain Mussolini, and they did not anticipate that German paratroopers would land at the location where Mussolini was being held. It is said that Italian soldiers had orders that if anyone tried to rescue him, Mussolini should be killed without pardon. The surrender conditions were signed on September 3. After studying the conditions, the Soviet Union authorized General Eisenhower to sign on behalf of the Soviet Union. Thus, the armistice agreement was agreed to by Britain, America, and the Soviet Union."</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Eden Clarifies Relations with Spain</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – British relations with Spain was the subject of many questions put to Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons today. These relations included the recent meeting between British Ambassador to Spain Sir Samuel Hoare and General Franco. Eden replied that Hoare had urged Franco to note the British government's frequent complaints of dissatisfaction with actions that discriminated against British interests. While the Spanish government had dealt with a number of these incidents, some remained unresolved. When asked if the British government had considered appropriate measures in case General Franco's response was unfavorable, Eden replied, "The government has agreed to investigate these grievances, and I deeply hope that they will be able to address them."</p>
<h3>British and American Air Forces To Continue Bombing German Cities</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to London reports, British Prime Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons on Tuesday that British and American air forces will continue to carry out organized destruction of German cities in the future.</p>
<h3>U.S. Production Board Chairman Nelson Visits Britain</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to London sources, U.S. Production Board Chairman Nelson arrived in London yesterday and immediately visited British Production Minister Lyttelton. This is Nelson's first visit to Britain since taking office, and it is at the invitation of the British Production Minister. In the past year, the British Production Minister has visited Washington twice.</p>
<h3>New Australian Cabinet Sworn In; Government Structure Unchanged</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to information received here, the second Curtin government of Australia was sworn in at Canberra on Monday. The structure of the government is the same as before the recent election, with only minor changes. After Foreign Minister Evatt refused to run for re-election, Army Minister Forde was elected Deputy Leader of the Labor Party and Deputy Prime Minister. The cabinet members are as follows: Prime Minister Curtin, Army Minister Forde, Treasurer Chifley, Attorney General and Foreign Minister Evatt, Supply Minister Beasley, Navy Minister Makin, Air Force and Civil Aviation Minister Drakeford, Minister of War Organization and Industry Dedman. The above individuals are all members of the War Cabinet. Other cabinet members include representatives from various factions of the Labor Party, most of whom support the workers. The Sydney Morning Herald commented on the new cabinet, stating: "The success of the first Curtin government, on the whole, cannot conceal the failures and weaknesses of individual appointments." Forde's appointment as deputy leader is a reward for his many years of loyal service, but he is not suitable to act as prime minister. The Sydney Morning Herald stated that several extremely mediocre cabinet members have made a comeback. The biggest weakness of the Labor Party is the positioning of unsuitable individuals. If Curtin wants to strengthen his government, he should appoint young and talented individuals as undersecretaries and assistant cabinet members.</p>
<h3>Staff of Italian Embassy in Germany Detained</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Staff of the Italian Embassy who did not join the new Fascist government are currently being held at a well-known resort in Bavaria. Staff of the embassy and most Italian civilians, many of whom were journalists, had already boarded a special train to return to Italy, but after Italy surrendered and Badoglio fled, Italian territory was either occupied by the Allies or under the jurisdiction of the Fascist Republic. Therefore, they could not return home. Italian journalists have been allowed to continue to Italy, but diplomatic personnel are being held in Bavaria.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Smolensk Front; German Troops in South Adopt Evacuation Strategy</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Havas: Currently, the focus of the fighting on the Eastern Front remains in the Smolensk area. Soviet troops are using large quantities of artillery and tanks to launch fierce attacks on German defensive positions and attempting to use a pincer movement to encircle the city from the south. North of the Moscow-Smolensk highway, Soviet troops are advancing towards the northern defense line of the city, and German counterattacks have been successful. The weather in the southern part of the Eastern Front has improved, so Soviet troops are about to launch another offensive, with newly equipped reserve mechanized units participating. The pressure from Soviet troops along the northern coast of the Sea of Azov is particularly intense. The Soviet objective is clearly to reach the Dnieper River bend and Crimea. Through skillful operations, German troops have cut off the link between the advancing Soviet troops and their rear, and Soviet troops are currently trapped a few kilometers east of Melitopol and Zaporozhye. Soviet troops are concentrating their forces behind their positions, indicating that the Soviet command is about to resume the offensive. Further north, Soviet advances towards Dniepropetrovsk have achieved only minor successes, but German troops are adopting flexible strategies, so their losses are very small. The strong German defensive fortifications in the Poltava area have been able to resist for several weeks, and on Monday, the situation there was largely unchanged. Southeast of Nezhin, the Soviet pressure on the Kiev area seems to be weakening, but in the north, Soviet troops are increasing pressure in an attempt to approach Chernigov and reach the mountainous area in the middle of the Dnieper River. Fierce fighting is taking place in this area. West of Bryansk and east of Rostov, Soviet troops have made advances due to the German evacuation movement. In this area, Soviet troops have achieved only slight success.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Economic Control, Exerting the National Government's Political Power: Aoki's Talk to Japanese Journalists Regarding the Greater East Asia Sphere</h3>
<p>The unconditional surrender of the Batlle Berres government is clearly a betrayal of morality and divine will, an act intolerable to both gods and humans. Fortunately, Commander Mussolini has been rescued. Now, Germany's European fortress is gradually becoming stronger, and Japan's certainty of victory and invincibility in East Asia is becoming increasingly consolidated. The Imperial Government has declared its attitude to both domestic and foreign audiences: "Cooperation with the nationals of European allies and the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia is becoming increasingly close. We are consistently seeking to defeat our old enemies, Britain and America." We can only unite our efforts, exert our maximum war effort, control the movements in the coveted north, overcome the fierce battles in the South Pacific, and shatter the enemy's attempt to counterattack Burma, in order to strive for final victory and advance shoulder to shoulder with the nations of Greater East Asia. Therefore, we cannot but be concerned about everything in Greater East Asia, especially the movements of allied China. In response to a request from our newspaper, Aoki, the Greater East Asia Minister, disclosed the current situation of the China issue as follows. The following is a question-and-answer session between our reporter and Minister Aoki:</p>
<p>Question: To complete the Greater East Asia War, the unity of Greater East Asia is even more important. Everyone believes that resolving the China issue is the central task at present. Please share your insights on this point.</p>
<p>Assisting China's Independence and Autonomy</p>
<p>Answer: Due to the so-called unity of Greater East Asia, the importance of resolving the China issue is even greater, and we must make even greater efforts in the future. The goal of the government's policy towards China, as clearly indicated by Prime Minister Tojo, is to assist the Republic of China in achieving independence and autonomy. During my recent visit to China to inspect the actual situation, I witnessed various measures.</p>
<p>One of them is the adjustment of government agencies, the most prominent of which is the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council. This seems to be an organization with the nature of a wartime cabinet. Important national policies can be quickly decided and strongly implemented in the National Defense Council, and representatives of the North China Political Affairs Commission also participate in it. Other economic measures, such as the National Economic Commission and the New People's Movement Promotion Association, as well as the agencies for national spiritual mobilization and their operations, have made significant progress compared to before. Another point that is significantly different from what I saw when I was in China is the strengthening of the National Government's position in economic control. In the past, many economic control matters were managed due to our military needs, but now most of them have been transferred to the National Government for its own handling, especially regarding the control of prices and materials. With the National General Chamber of Commerce as the center, the autonomous control of private sector operators is implemented, and the government stands in the position of supervision and guidance, carrying out the control in the form of official-private cooperation or Sino-Japanese cooperation. I believe that this can open a new path for exerting the National Government's political power in the future.</p>
<p>Question: It is said that the National Government's political power has penetrated deeply into the people in various places. Then, to what extent has it spread to Shanghai? In other words, has the National Government now grasped Shanghai? Is it possible to mobilize Shanghai's national capital and make it participate in China's economic construction?</p>
<p>Answer: Taking over the Shanghai concessions is one of the important policies towards China. Seeing the scene of the Kuomintang flag flying everywhere fills me with emotions about the past and the present. Therefore, the recovery of the concessions can be regarded as the realization of the national goal since Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution. As a result, most knowledgeable people can understand the significance of recovering the concessions for China's independence and autonomy. However, some people do not fully understand its importance to the country, which I find regrettable.</p>
<p>I believe that this is because the people of Shanghai have been detached from the rule of the country for many years and are completely accustomed to a life based on personal interests. Especially now, due to price issues, everyone is concerned about economic problems, shifting their focus to daily life issues, and inevitably neglecting the significance of important national issues.</p>
<p>However, economic problems will gradually stabilize. Moreover, in today's world, people in any part of the world cannot escape the control of the country. If they can understand this point, the people of Shanghai will naturally understand the true significance of resolving the concession issue.</p>
<p>Question: Regarding China's price issue, the fundamental cause may be currency instability or the Shanghai financial community's bystander attitude towards the war. I would like to hear your insightful views on this point.</p>
<p>The Root Cause of the Price Issue</p>
<p>Answer: China's price issue, on the one hand, is of course related to goods, and on the other hand, of course, it is related to transportation. The so-called Shanghai was once a concentration point for cheap foreign goods, that is, a region where goods from various countries in the East freely entered. However, the freezing of funds by Britain and the United States, followed by the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, has made the import and export of goods greatly different from the past. From the perspective of prices, this is the biggest reason for the high prices. As for domestic production, a part of it is due to the war, the security is unstable, and the productivity is hindered. Also, due to transportation and distribution, as well as various restrictions on sales and distribution, it cannot proceed smoothly. Due to various reasons unavoidable under wartime conditions, this is a major cause of the shortage of materials. The procurement of materials, especially the control of prices, cannot be as effective as in Japan, which is also a reason for the shortage of materials. Therefore, in any case, in addition to rationally allocating and utilizing existing materials, it is necessary to increase agricultural production, eliminate the anxiety about the food problem, and at the same time promote the production of daily necessities in Shanghai and other places, utilizing China's rich production capacity of raw materials, and cultivating the absolute quantity of material supply. Focusing on doing this, Japan will also cooperate in promoting the resolution of this issue, which is the most important thing. Of course, on the other hand, it is also necessary to encourage savings and strengthen economic control at any time, and it is necessary to fundamentally increase production and promote smooth sales. These must be placed at the center of attention.</p>
<p>Question: In Shanghai, the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has recently been implemented. Regarding this measure, from the perspective of materials or currency, people believe that it is a measure to suppress the rise in prices. I wonder if, subsequently, Shanghai prices will have a gradual downward trend?</p>
<p>Cooperating in Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Answer: The National Government implemented the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Shanghai in early August, and our country also cooperated with the Chinese policy and purchased cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Japan. This is a typical example of the National Government's vigorously implemented price policy and material countermeasures, as well as Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Regarding this point, not only Shanghai, but most of the people welcome the National Government's wise decision. This can be said to be a great success for the National Government in exerting its political power, and its impact on prices is particularly significant. Not only did the price of cotton yarn and cotton cloth fall to the purchase standard price, but other prices, except for a part, also fell. Recently, Shanghai prices have been rising almost step by step, but due to the measures taken, the rising trend stopped suddenly, and the reaction turned to a decline. This is unprecedented in Shanghai's economic circles.</p>
<p>The purchased cotton yarn and cotton cloth will be under the control of the National Government in the future. If it can be used to purchase agricultural products and other necessary materials, it will be able to exert a greater effect on procuring materials and controlling prices.</p>
<p>Question: From the perspective of stabilizing people's livelihood and grasping people's hearts, the most important thing is the food issue. The food supply in Central China can generally be self-sufficient, and the food supply in North China has always been regarded as difficult. Please talk about the food situation in North China, focusing on the food issue.</p>
<p>North China Striving to Increase Food Production</p>
<p>Answer: The food issue is indeed important from the political aspect of stabilizing people's hearts, the price issue, and the perspective of promoting various industrial plans. North China was originally a place where it was necessary to obtain food subsidies from other places. This is based on historical statistics that can be investigated. Therefore, the authorities of the North China Political Affairs Commission and the Japanese side are also doing everything possible to increase food production. They have engaged economic research institutions to fundamentally study the countermeasures for increasing food production in North China to cooperate with the Chinese policy. However, it is not easy to achieve self-sufficiency in the short term. On the one hand, it is still necessary to increase the production of cotton and other products. The current countermeasure is to supplement the shortage from various sources. The methods are left to the Chinese side to devise, and our country will provide full cooperation.

<h3>Food Control Committee to Be Established Soon; Organization and Personnel Determined; Sino-Japanese Members to Cooperatively Promote Committee Affairs</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: The Rice and Grain Control Committee, which is being actively prepared, has held preparatory meetings and determined the entire plan for purchasing rice and grain. The internal organizational structure and important personnel will be officially announced within the next few days. The official establishment date is expected to be no later than October 1st. Sino-Japanese members of the committee will cooperatively promote committee affairs. According to reliable sources, the internal organization of the committee is divided into four sections under the Secretary-General: Confidential Section, Document Section, Foreign Affairs Section, and Planning Section. Under the sections, there are four departments: General Affairs Department, Finance Department, Purchasing Department, and Storage and Distribution Department. Under the four departments, there are three to four divisions, and under the divisions, there are groups, and under the groups, there are offices. It is heard that the plan stipulates that the purchase and storage of rice and grain in the domestic rice-producing areas will be mainly undertaken by the Rice and Grain Trade Association, and it is also necessary to restore the establishment of the Rice and Grain Trade Association in various places.</p>
<p>Establishment Date Still Under Discussion</p>
<p>Another report: The Rice and Grain Control Committee has become an event of great concern to all citizens since its preparation. According to a report by the Datong News Agency reporter, although the establishment date of the committee has not been determined, most of the personnel have been appointed. Since yesterday, a paper sign "Rice and Grain Control Committee Preparatory Office" has been posted on the first floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the offices of each department have also been set up. The main hall on the first floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been decided to be converted into the general office of the Rice and Grain Control Committee. Because the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a membership meeting in the main hall on the 26th, the layout of the office will not be able to start until after the 26th.</p>
<p>Most Important Personnel Determined</p>
<p>According to inquiries from responsible parties in the committee, most of the internal personnel have been determined. The head of the Finance Department is Zai [blank], the head of the General Affairs Department is Wu Huanru concurrently, the head of the Purchasing Department is Yan Jiyun, and two deputy heads, one Chinese and one Japanese, have been added. The Chinese side is Shen Linqing, and the Japanese side is Ueda [blank] Jiro (specialist of the Japanese Embassy). The head of the Storage and Distribution Department is Chen Ziyi, and two deputy heads, one Chinese and one Japanese, have been added. The Chinese side is Gu Jiren, and the Japanese name has not yet been announced. Only one deputy director is set up under the director (not one Chinese and one Japanese), and the candidate has already been nominated as Hirono Toichi (Chairman of the Sino-Japanese Rice Grain Cooperative Association). As for the position of Secretary-General, a suitable candidate must be found.</p>
<p>Second Batch of Allotted Rice in Contact for Shipment</p>
<p>The Ministry of Food has allocated 150,000 bags of rice for civilian consumption in this city in the second batch. Among them, except for 50,000 bags in the Jingyang area and 18,790 bags in the first batch of Huzhou area that have not been transported, totaling more than 68,000 bags, the Japanese Huazhong Rice and Grain Distribution Association is entrusted to transport them. The remaining 100,000 bags in the Su-Song-Chang-Jia area are designated to be transported from the production area to Shanghai by the Chinese agency in charge of procurement and distribution in order to maintain people's food supply. According to what the Shanghai News Agency reporter learned, the shipment certificate for the second batch of food rice has been issued by the Ministry. As soon as the representative sent by the responsible transportation agency and the local grain administration personnel in charge of production and sales negotiate the procedures, transportation can begin.</p>
<h3>Application for Retaining Cotton Yarn and Cloth Deadline This Afternoon; Yarn and Cloth Tax Rates to Be Changed</h3>
<p>The National General Chamber of Commerce's Office for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth previously announced to all manufacturers that, in accordance with Article 30 of the Provisional Regulations for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth, factories and retailers should be allowed to retain an average quantity of one month's total sales or consumption in the first half of this year. Factories and retailers who have not yet come to the office to collect the application form for the retention of factories and stores and have not indicated the desired retention amount on the back can bring the temporary receipt from the office to collect it. It is known that the acceptance of this application form will be closed at 6:00 PM today, and those who are overdue will be regarded as having waived their rights. Also, when submitting the application, a sample of the goods must be attached.</p>
<p>In the past, the Ministry of Finance used a standard price of 5,500 yuan per bale of 20-count cotton yarn as the standard for levying 4% or 5% on cotton yarn and cloth, but at that time, the market price was actually 7 or 8 times higher than the standard price. This time, the government purchased cotton yarn and cotton cloth and stipulated that 10,000 yuan per bale of 20-count yarn is the standard price for yarn and cloth. The Ministry of Finance has decided to change the old tax rate. It is heard that the new tax rate in the future will also use 10,000 yuan per bale of 20-count as the standard, and all kinds of yarn and cloth will be uniformly levied at 5%.</p>
<p>Investigation Committee Established Yesterday</p>
<p>The National General Chamber of Commerce's Office for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth has established a Manufacturing and Processing Industry Investigation Committee and a Retailer Actual Quantity Investigation Committee to investigate and review the actual consumption of cotton yarn and cotton cloth by processing and manufacturing businesses and the actual sales of retailers. The committee members have been nominated and the organization is ready. The inaugural meeting was held simultaneously at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 22nd). Chairman Nie Lusheng presided over the meeting, reporting on the preparatory process and the significance of organizing the two committees. The regulations and the steps for investigating and reviewing yarn and cloth in the future were approved, and the work began immediately.</p>
<h3>Treatment of Foreign Prisoners Should Be the Same as Chinese Prisoners</h3>
<p>In the past, the treatment of foreign prisoners in this city's prisons was different from that of Chinese prisoners due to treaty relations. This kind of unequal treatment should be corrected urgently. Since the National Government implemented the takeover of the concessions, this city's judicial institutions, under the guidance of the Ministry of Justice, have swept away the past abnormal state and gradually moved towards unification. All prisoners in prison should be treated equally regardless of their nationality. It is known that the Shanghai Prison plans to provide foreign prisoners with bread daily, and the rest should be treated the same as Chinese prisoners, thoroughly eradicating unequal treaties. After the Shanghai Local Procuratorate submitted the report, it has forwarded it to the Ministry of Justice for review and approval.</p>

<p>The local authorities in this city have now completed the plan for implementing planned distribution of three major commodities: salt, matches, and soap. It will be officially announced and implemented at the beginning of next month. The Economic Department of the First District Public Office has studied the supply and inventory situation of these three items that will soon be subject to the distribution system. The distribution will be carried out in accordance with the distribution methods for rice, etc. Every resident of Shanghai will receive several salt purchase certificates, match purchase certificates, and soap purchase certificates each month.

It is also learned that the authorities' distribution of salt, soap, and matches will ensure that residents have an absolute sufficient supply, so there is no need to seek the black market. In order to avoid a situation similar to the delayed sugar distribution, the authorities have taken into account all the details of the distribution system for these three items before the official announcement of the planned distribution system. As for the monthly distribution quantity, it has not yet been determined as of yesterday, but it is expected to be announced within days.</p>

<p>Economic News</p>
<h3>Commentary: New Merchant Morality</h3>
<p>"Commercial ethics" is a term that we have long heard of. In these times of wartime economic hardship, commercial ethics is especially a pathway to upholding social welfare and fulfilling the lives of the masses. Therefore, it is called "New Merchant Morality." Any price gouging, heavy interest, false weights and measures, as well as tricks to make profit, monopolies, and receiving commissions, are all the opposite of the new merchant morality and should be especially avoided by wartime merchants.</p>
<p>Because we cannot help but constantly suspect whether the rice shops are accurate in their measurements of rice sold, whether the restrictions placed by coal briquette merchants on citizens' purchase limits are necessary, whether the large quantities of sugar distributed to sugar shops are mostly supplied to the black market, whether the prices of the sugary foods they sell are reasonable, whether the weights and measures used in stores and vegetable markets are up to standard, and whether the lack of goods available in general stores is intentional. Because we have seen that all of these things are tied to merchant morality and are closely related to the lives of the people, we vigorously advocate for the promotion of the new merchant morality in wartime.</p>
<p>The basic elements that constitute the new merchant morality are: prioritizing the public good over private interests as its ideal, being loyal to one's position as its responsibility, and managing rationally as its principle. Prioritizing the public good over private interests will prevent harming others for one's own benefit (for example, supplying allocated goods to the black market); being loyal to one's position will prevent benefiting oneself at public expense (for example, pretending to open a store but actually hoarding goods); and rational management will prevent failing to exercise one's economic and social functions, namely, the ability to produce and allocate (for example, having materials but not producing, having goods but not selling).</p>
<p>In a word, money is a merchant's material capital, and morality is a merchant's spiritual capital; if merchants' moral concepts are not blinded by monetary concepts, then the problem of social welfare and the problem of the lives of the masses will be more than half solved, especially in wartime.</p>
<h3>Various Businesses Request Associations to Apply for Raw Material Allocation to Discuss Effective Ways to Maintain Operations</h3>
<p>Various trade associations in this city have recently submitted requests from their member businesses stating that they lack raw materials for production, making it difficult to manufacture goods. In order to maintain normal operations and enable citizens to purchase goods, they are resorting to using the black market to supplement their supplies for sale. However, this practice only increases costs and is not a long-term solution. Therefore, they are requesting that the authorities be promptly informed of the current situation of their member businesses and that they be allowed to allocate the raw materials that were previously approved, such as sugar, oil, edible oil, sesame, red beans, vegetable beans, and soybeans, in order to maintain normal production and facilitate sales, thereby sustaining business operations. Recognizing that the matters stated by the member businesses are factual and in order to seek the welfare of the trade, the responsible persons of the various trade associations have promptly submitted the requests to the relevant authorities, requesting prompt allocation of raw materials; otherwise, not only will member businesses be unable to operate, but the citizens will also be affected. It is heard that some progress has been made. It is also learned that trade associations in the local confectionery, snack food, and strong-flower industries have recently convened meetings of their directors and supervisors to discuss matters related to improving the welfare of their members. They are also urging member businesses to strictly comply with sales regulations and to maintain close contact with the association in order to take unified steps to promote welfare.</p>
<p>China Stock Trends</p>
<p>Yesterday, the China stock market was unusually sharp, continuing the upward momentum of the previous day. Major players had already initiated the rally, and new and old investors further fueled the rise, causing sellers to raise prices continuously. In the afternoon, sellers disappeared, and prices continued to advance higher. The market sentiment was still pushing stocks in the new industry and department stores the most sharply. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Financials: In the financial sector, stocks of Continental, Zhejiang Xingye, and Jin Cheng saw high prices emerge one after another. Salt shares showed a breakthrough. Other stocks were relatively flat.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals: New Asia Pharmaceutical saw a huge surge under heavy buying pressure, breaking through previous highs. The opportunity to step up another level was more than remarkable. China Medicine flew high under the absolute advantage of major players. Only China-England Dispensary remained at its original price. Stocks of New Star, Five Continents, China-West, and Star Perfumery all opened above the previous day's price. Suddenly, a buyer was found searching for Scientific Chemical, and it also rose sharply.</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On saw particularly rapid progress, rising two levels in both the morning and afternoon. Sincere also rose, exceeding previous highs in the afternoon. Stockpiled goods and Lane Crawford were both trending higher without looking back.</p>
<p>Textiles: The textile sector saw robust buying interest. Wing On Textile rose another level, with the afternoon buying price exceeding previous highs. Da Sheng Factories 1, 2, and 3 remained stagnant. Guangqin and Rongfeng Textile saw buyers push them up. China Textile, Sincere, and Meyer saw even stronger gains. Hongsheng, Wuhe, Hongxing, and Great China Weaving remained firm. American Wool also rose. China Underwear saw a sudden sharp increase, and in the afternoon, it also knocked on the door. Rumors of Jingfu dyeing and weaving's increased capital were even more prevalent, rising two levels again. Jinglun continued to see prices raised.</p>
<p>Real Estate: Stocks of New Yick, Union, Wing Hing, and other real estate companies continued to rise due to high demand and limited supply.</p>
<p>Utilities: Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity and China Electricity saw flat performance in the morning but rose sharply in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Industrials: Jiu An Industrial rose above previous highs in the morning, and flew even higher in the afternoon. Great China, pulled out by buyers, surpassed previous highs in the afternoon. The price increase of Great China Matches was even more unexpected. However, Hua Cheng, Dian Nan Yang were more stable.</p>
<p>China and China Merchants Cement jointly rose above previous highs. Han-Yeh-Ping had buyers only after reaching previous highs. Great China Miscellany saw someone seeking to buy at high prices. Standard Mei Fen and Amoy Canning also saw strong gains. Many transactions of Baoan Glass, Great China Recordings, China Enameled Ware and China Brick &amp; Tile also occurred outside previous highs.</p>
<p>Summary of Business Conditions</p>
<p>The bond black market was firm. Types A, D, C, and E all saw increases. Only Type B remained unchanged. Transactions were not sparse.</p>
<p>Call Loan Rate: Yesterday morning, the Call Loan Rate posted by the Money Industry Association was 1.8 cents per day.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: The market for daily necessities showed mixed trends. Soap prices declined due to new Xiang Mao goods flooding the market. Match sales were still strong, and candles remained stable. The market saw more gains than losses. The market for pharmaceuticals has been weak recently, perhaps because the season has passed, sales channels are narrow, and speculators are afraid to act. Therefore, prices are generally weak. Among them, only Jiu Gutang Cai saw increases without retracement. Other products, such as Bagua Dan, Headache Powder, and Wanjin You, have stopped falling, but lack the strength to rise. Compared with the multiple times of price increase of other goods in the market, this is a world of difference.</p>
<h3>Searches Become Increasingly Strict</h3>
<p>In order to ensure the normal supply of goods and to eliminate illegal manipulation, the authorities have taken decisive measures. Anyone carrying major or important goods must be subject to strict searches and must present a removal permit issued by the relevant authorities; otherwise, it will be considered illegal smuggling, and the goods will be confiscated, and the persons involved will be taken into custody for investigation. According to the Shanghai News reporter's investigation yesterday, the authorities have recently been increasingly strict in their search efforts. In addition to dispatching a large number of detectives near various land and water terminals to check the luggage of incoming and outgoing passengers, they are also deploying detectives at important intersections to pay attention to pedestrians carrying heavy packages and goods. At the same time, they are strictly prohibiting people from carrying heavy objects on trams or buses to prevent the smuggling of goods out of the area. Therefore, when citizens purchase items from stores, they should request an invoice to prove it when questioned by military police along the way.</p>
<h3>The Budding Era of the Nursery School Movement (Continued)</h3>
<p>YWCA Nursery School</p>
<p>Located at 638 Weihaiwei Road (near Moore Road 4), the Chinese Christian Women's Youth Association has an affiliated "Working Women's Nursery School." It and the Shanghai Nursery School are sister organizations. Originally, when Ms. Bian and others initiated the establishment of a nursery school in Shanghai in the 29th year, there were two different opinions among the initiators. One side believed that serving the laboring masses was of the utmost importance and necessity, so they advocated for running a completely free nursery school that only accepted the children of laborers. The other side believed that the most urgent need for nursery schools at present was among general working women, not necessarily female workers, who worked in industry and commerce, and even served social organizations, and urgently needed to reduce their burden on their children. As a result, the authorities of the YWCA believed that the two could cooperate on a trial basis. Later, Ms. Bian Xusun took charge of the Shanghai Nursery School, while Ms. Chen Shanming, an official of the association, took charge of the Working Women's Nursery School. Its purpose is: 1. To seek the happiness of the children themselves, 2. To adapt to the needs of working women, 3. To instill in parents common knowledge of childcare, 4. To cultivate childcare talents, 5. To promote the nursery school movement. When it was first established, the quota was set at 50 children. The qualifications for admission were: 1. Aged two to four, able to walk freely, 2. Mothers with a job or career and no time to care for their children, 3. No infectious diseases after a medical examination. The procedures for admission were: 1. Introduced by someone, fill in the application form in detail, 2. Medical examination, 3. Fill out a guarantee form after admission. At that time, only day students were accepted, with admission at 8:30 am and departure at 5:00 pm. It was not until the autumn of the 30th year that boarding students were accepted at the request of general parents. Later, a kindergarten was added, and the business became increasingly developed. However, due to the limitations of housing and funding, they have not been able to realize their original ideals. There are now a total of 30 kindergarten students, including 14 aged four to six, and 16 aged one to four, and a total of 42 boarding students, including 20 aged four to six, and 22 aged two to four.</p>
<p>At 9:00 am, head teacher Dai Zizhen was already teaching the children to sing in the classroom on the second floor. This is the senior kindergarten class, and dozens of children are sitting in a circle, all happy. In several other classrooms, the children are being guided by teachers such as Gao Changming. In addition to the teachers, there are nine enthusiastic nannies caring for them. The daily menu is written on the blackboard next to the desk: Breakfast: Tofu salad, white porridge; Lunch: Stir-fried green vegetables, pig liver and mashed potatoes, green beans, potato soup; Afternoon snack: Pears; Dinner: Pig liver and vegetable porridge. The concern for economy, cleanliness, and nutritional value is truly painstaking!</p>
<p>The third floor is the children's dormitory, rest room, and playground. Although the room is not large, almost every square foot of the floor is well utilized, but it is arranged in a way that does not feel too crowded. Each low wooden bed has white, clean bedding. The washroom, bathroom, and medical equipment, although small and practical, are generally complete. The children of the vocational nursery school are the happiest generation. Just like the large slogan on the wall of the school: "Facing the sun! Facing the light! We grow up in collective life!"</p>
<p>Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>Now in Shanghai, there are only two nursery schools run by the YWCA. Among them, the vocational nursery school charges the most fees. Starting from August of this year, the total monthly fee, including education fee, childcare fee, meal fee, snack fee, accommodation fee, medical fee, stationery and toy fee, and miscellaneous fee, is 130 yuan for a full-day student, 250 yuan for a full-day student including lunch, and 450 yuan for a boarding student. In reality, however, because the income of general working women and salaried workers is too low, few can pay the fee. Therefore, it is still a service, and the YWCA subsidizes it every month, at least more than 10,000 yuan. There is a risk of increasing difficulties in the future. As for the Shanghai Nursery School, since it does not charge any fees, the original annual budget for this year was 230,000 yuan, with 70,000 yuan allocated by the YWCA. However, the actual price increase is alarming, and the budget is far from sufficient. It relies entirely on donations from all sectors of society. Fundraising began last winter, and the results of fundraising this spring were about 100,000 yuan. In January, a request was made to the Shanghai Poverty and Sickness Relief Association for subsidies, and Commissioner Yao Huixiang went to investigate. He believed that the children accepted by the school were mostly the children of poor workers and orphans without guardians, and was a philanthropic organization with continuous activity, suitable for subsidies. Later, the association decided to subsidize 4,000 yuan per month from February to October, totaling 24,000 yuan. In August, another subsidy of 24,000 yuan was given. It played a role in promoting the nursery school movement.</p>
<p>In addition to funding, housing and talent are the two major difficulties currently facing nursery schools. The housing of the Shanghai Nursery School is indeed quite ideal, and there is also the possibility of expanding the number of students. Although the monthly rent is as high as 1,000 yuan, it cannot be said to be unusually high. However, the landlord has long had the intention of taking it back. Fortunately, the heart of those who understand the philanthropic meaning of helping the nursery school in a tactful manner, and the landlord also understands it, temporarily allowing it to be rented at double the price. If there are no further rent increases or forced evictions, it will be of great help to the future of the nursery school business. The housing of the working women's nursery school is still too narrow. If larger housing is available, it will definitely help the development of the business.</p>
<p>The nursery school is a new social enterprise. It requires people with vision, enthusiasm, valley power and specialized skills who can endure hardships, persevere, and work hard to serve. Such talents are still not easy to find today, especially because the light cost is too tight and the salary is too thin. The service providers themselves have come with the determination to sacrifice their service, and most of them are Christians who absolutely do not plan on material rewards, but if there is a family burden, and even their own lives are not enough to sustain, then it is not surprising that the mobility of the school's nannies and workers is too great.</p>
<p>The two nursery schools run by the Shanghai YWCA have opened a way for the Shanghai nursery school movement, and have proved the urgent need of society for nursery schools, and proved that as long as they are willing to run it seriously, it will definitely run well. However, after all, due to the lack of funds and talents, the scope of its business is still greatly limited, and there are still many obstacles in the future of the business. Their cause can only satisfy a small part of society's needs. In order to reform the early childhood education system and cultivate healthy children, in order to liberate women so that they can work hard for the social and national causes, China's nursery school movement must be widely developed, and Shanghai should be the base point of the national nursery school movement.

<p>Review and Discussion</p>
<h3>Implementation of Taxation Rights</h3>
<p>After the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, the implementation of taxation rights is an important part of the　New China Policy. The transfer of taxation rights has been moved forward　and is now scheduled to be implemented on October 1st. This matter is based on the Treaty on the Transfer of Taxation Rights concluded on July 31st of this year. The National Government made its first notification to the Japanese side on September 10th, and the official gazettes of China and Japan announced it on September 20th. We believe that the transfer of taxation rights is a natural measure. Looking back at Japan's new policy towards China at the beginning of this year, or tracing back to the earliest policy revealed in the Konoe Statement, we can see that this is an established national policy; now, the realization of the abolition of extraterritoriality is, needless to say, an expression of a lofty moral spirit.</p>
<p>According to the first notification on September 10th, the scope of taxation to be implemented includes most of the central taxes (except income tax) and part of the local taxes. Since August 1st, these have been paid to the National Government in the form of donations, so the burden on Japanese residents has hardly changed. It is feared that in the future, the Chinese and Japanese authorities will negotiate to avoid the sacrifice of double taxation and ensure　that Japanese residents do not feel an unexpected shock. Although Japanese residents in China can rest assured on this point, it is hoped that they will fully understand the true meaning of the moral policy towards China so that the national policy can be thoroughly implemented. The new policy towards China is not only a treaty or statement between the government and the Vatican, but also depends on the practice of the people. From this point of view, the task of overseas Chinese compatriots is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>With the current political power of the National Government, it is certainly impossible to expect taxation like that of Japan. Since strengthening the National Government is a fundamental national policy, it is better to transfer taxation rights as soon as possible than to　wait for a sound　tax system and taxation methods. This is the best way to strengthen the National Government. Following the second and third notifications that will be implemented soon for full taxation, unexpected misunderstandings and conflicts may arise, or the defects of the Chinese system's machinery and authority may be exposed. However, if such things　should occur, it would be difficult to implement, which would not be the manner of a great nation's people. We must always advise and urge reflection and improvement in a spirit of tolerance. Only in this way can we have a positive attitude to help correct China's shortcomings.</p>
<p>At the same time, we have to hope that the National Government will take this opportunity to adjust the tax system and taxation methods to make them rational. This is an indispensable prerequisite for a modern country. Overseas Chinese compatriots have no objection to the transfer of taxation rights and are fully aware of future changes in burden. What is hoped is a fair burden, and that the National Government can use this burden reasonably and appropriately. Whether the National Government authorities can fully fulfill other obligations arising from the transfer of taxation rights will have a great impact on the abolition of other extraterritorial rights. We have to look forward to the efforts of the National Government authorities in this regard. (Ki Ching: Translated from the Continental New Daily, September 21st)</p>
<h3>Registration of Financial Institutions - Submission Procedures</h3>
<p>The Silver and Money Industry Association conveys the Ministry of Finance's instruction: Upon investigation, in accordance with the revised Banking Registration Regulations promulgated by the Ministry on June 8th of the 29th year, applications for registration of financial institutions can be submitted directly to the Ministry or to the local government for forwarding to the Ministry for handling. However, if the application is submitted by the local government, there are no explicit provisions on which department or bureau should forward it. This matter has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Hereafter, when financial　institutions apply for registration and submit it through the local government to the Ministry, it should be forwarded by the Provincial Government's Department of Finance　or the Special Municipal Government's Bureau of Finance to clarify the system. Except for branch offices, all associations are hereby ordered to notify their members accordingly.</p>
<h3>Abundant Stock of Matches</h3>
<p>According to news from the match industry, the stock of matches in this city is quite abundant, estimated at more than 10,000 boxes, which can meet the needs of the entire city for two years. The rumors spread by speculators in recent weeks are unfounded. Generally, facts can only be proven after the implementation of the allocation system.</p>

<h3>Badoglio's Surrender - The Japan-Germany Axis Remains Unshaken</h3>
<p>— Toshio Shiratori</p>
<p>The Italian Badoglio regime concluded an armistice with the British and Americans, betraying the Japan-Germany-Italy Tripartite Alliance　and the anti-military　pact, and surrendering unconditionally to the enemy forces.　The state of affairs since the regime’s formation to this day has been within our expectations. We are not at all surprised; the Japan-Germany axis will not　be shaken in the slightest. —Former Ambassador to Italy, who was directly in charge of diplomacy when the Tripartite Alliance was concluded, and a member of the Taisei Yokusankai with many friends in the top echelons of the Japanese and Italian governments, Mr. Toshio Shiratori, spoke on the morning of the 9th about "Italy's withdrawal from the front lines" as follows, asking us to　firm our beliefs in order to cope.</p>
<p>The Solid Defense of Northern Italy</p>
<p>Italy is now disregarding the Tripartite Pact and violating the separate peace treaty. On the German side, because of the alliance relationship, they have been fighting alongside Italy and sending troops at Italy's request, so they will never withdraw their troops from Italy on the grounds of the armistice. Moreover, they will not accept this withdrawal request. The German army believes that in any case, they must take the necessary military measures. In short, the defense of northern Italy is as solid as a city with walls of metal and a moat of boiling water, so from a practical point of view, Italy's withdrawal is not a big problem. The German side has often said this in the past six months.</p>
<p>From a purely military point of view, Germany would rather cut off the new stumbling block　, and Mussolini's resignation has already decided this matter.</p>
<p>Mussolini has stepped down, and the twenty-year Fascist regime has been ousted. How can they continue the war? The Tripartite Alliance was Mussolini's policy, the Fascist policy. After this policy was liquidated, today's withdrawal from the front lines is a natural occurrence.</p>
<p>German-French Relations Will Be Closer</p>
<p>As mentioned above, from a purely military point of view, it is not a big deal. Italy's national power, in Churchill's words, is not even one-tenth of Germany's. In order to help Italy, which lacks war materials and has insufficient national power, Germany has previously taken on a very heavy burden, lending them elite weapons and having to send a million tons of coal by truck every month, which is a very laborious assistance.</p>
<p>Now that they have broken away, on the German side, the effect of shortening the front lines is of great significance not only on the front lines but also in the following respects. Below, from a political point of view　, the enemy is spreading the impression throughout the world that the Axis is in danger.　I do not think so. Italy may be lost from now on, but it can be asserted　that German-French relations will therefore improve further. German-French relations are already quite harmonious today, and what hinders them is the existence of Italy. In my opinion, the harmony and closeness between Germany and France can progress more rapidly in the future. Moreover, Germany is also focusing on this. Losing Italy while Germany and France become closer, so politically speaking, Germany is not as disadvantaged as the anti-Axis countries say. The attitudes of Turkey and Spain, or the attitudes of the Balkan　small countries, may waver slightly, but　this depends on Germany's military strength and its ability to control them. In this regard, I believe there is no problem.</p>
<p>Looking at the various situations in Spain, Turkey, and Japan over the past three or four years, the attitude they are taking today is the only possible attitude, so there will not be major changes in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, from a political point of view, there is no major impact as the enemy thinks.</p>
<p>Germany and Italy Have Different National Conditions</p>
<p>On the part of our country's people, seeing Italy's withdrawal, they think it is unfavorable to the Axis. This is because they do not know the national conditions of Germany and Italy at all. The people, national power, materials, history, and everything else of these two countries are completely different. There are many pro-British and American Italians in the country, and eliminating the Fascist Party's military power is also the enemy's strategy.</p>
<p>Germany, as history has shown, is a very great country. Comparing the previous wars with today's war, the conditions of the previous wars were very bad, but they still confronted for four years, fighting stubbornly, and finally collapsed internally and politically. Today, internal dissenters have been swept away, and in terms of materials, they are not troubled by food shortages. Moreover, the German people know that if they fail this time, everything will be over. So, it would be a big mistake to examine Italy and Germany in the same way.</p>
<p>If Germany were to be defeated, then the Soviet Union and Britain would also be exhausted and collapse together! I absolutely do not think Germany has failed. Even if it fails, I believe Britain and the United States will also fail together. Finally, when it comes to Japan, it is currently necessary for Japan to be in the leading position and fight with its own strength. If Japan and Germany fight shoulder to shoulder to the end, we will have an invincible attitude, and victory will surely be ours.</p>
<p>No Need for Pessimism About the European Front</p>
<p>There is no need to be pessimistic about Badoglio's separate peace, and the　judgment of final victory is still as reliable as ever. However, at this time, the center of the war will be in Japan. We should not forget this. This point is that Japan and Germany are really very resilient and reliable. This year and next year will be the most intense and critical times for the evolution of the situation. If we can overcome this difficulty, then we will be invincible.

<h3>Appealing for the General Small-Scale Cotton Yarn and Cloth Businesses</h3>
<p>— Chen Feifei</p>
<p>Since the government implemented the policy of comprehensively purchasing cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai, it has been four weeks. The impact has been felt across all sectors. Applying this comprehensive purchase to those who specialize in hoarding and speculation for high profits is not excessive. However, applying it to those who rely on regular cotton yarn and cloth businesses for a living is too harsh. They should be treated differently, and not regarded as the same. It should be known that there are many who hoard cotton yarn and cloth for speculation, but there are also many who run cotton yarn and cloth businesses to make a living. Imposing a comprehensive purchase on all of them is unfair and may affect the entire financial and social order. It is hoped that the wise government authorities, under the principle of implementing the purchase and without hindering the wartime economy of the Greater East Asia War, will do their best to rescue the small-scale merchants who run cotton yarn and cloth businesses. Here, I will try to describe the simplest side-by-side war support method:</p>
<p>The biggest targets of general speculative hoarders are cotton yarn, plain white cloth (such as Longtou fine cloth), processed popular goods (such as Sijunzi serge, Shilin blue cloth...), factory orders, and warehouse receipts, because they are large in quantity and easy to handle. As for the various types of original factory cotton cloth (i.e., improved native cloth) among the processed cotton cloth, the quality varies, and they have not been noticed by hoarders. The scope of business is also far less extensive than the above-mentioned goods. Those who engage in these businesses are all small-scale operators who usually buy and sell according to regulations, and the price fluctuations are　small, so there is no speculation or hoarding to speak of. Therefore, they should be treated differently in this comprehensive purchase.</p>
<p>The government authorities should also provide relief to general small-scale operators in the payment clauses, because most of the funds of the above-mentioned small businesses are short of funds, or they borrow from silver and money businesses, or they use goods as collateral for loans to make ends meet. Now, generally, after the purchase, one-quarter of the bid price is given in three months. Asking when the deadline for the general conclusion is no more than four months, how will the external loans and mortgages be repaid? All the cotton yarn and cloth have already been applied for sale to the government, not only is there no property to break; but also there is no money for living expenses, and even the silver and money businesses will be stranded due to the纱布业's failure to repay the debts. The entire finance will be shaken, the future will be unimaginable, and it will also have an adverse impact on the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the government authorities are requested to help the general cotton yarn and cloth retailers and the gold and vice industries within the principle of avoiding currency inflation; for example, the government orders all cotton yarn and cloth merchants and silver and money businesses to report the loans and mortgages owed by the yarn and cloth merchants to the silver and money businesses within three days, and send personnel to inspect them once after comparing them. If the report is not false, they shall be allowed to change the amount of debt owed to an immediate remittance order issued by the reserve bank, so that the debts can be cleared, and the　balance of the funds will still be returned according to the statutory period; in this way, the general retailers will not be able to revive, but they will die without burden; that is, the financial industry will also rely on it to maintain, and it will not hinder the government's currency policy, which is a perfect solution in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: the people are the foundation of the country, and when the foundation is solid, the country will be stable. It is hoped that the government will follow this principle, take into account the difficulties of the general retailers, and consider their side-by-side relief measures. This is a great fortune.</p>
<h3>A Serious Problem</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Since the government implemented the policy of purchasing yarn and cloth in Shanghai, the general hoarders who truly hoard large quantities of yarn and cloth are on the verge of despair. Of course, they are reaping what they sowed! The wheels of heaven grind slowly, but they grind fine, and their sins cannot be forgiven. However, the general legitimate yarn and cloth merchants (in other words, not the real troublemakers) who adjust the supply and demand, sell to cloth factories, dyeing and weaving factories, towel factories, sock factories, as manufacturing raw materials, and directly sell to retail consumers, are unfortunately also implicated and heading towards the same end! This can be said to be: "When a city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat are affected!" Although: under a clear and resolute, unshakeable national　, no one　can avoid it, and no one can be biased! Is there any distinction between right and wrong, jade and stone? The most pitiful are the tens of thousands of employees in the yarn and cloth industry (quasi-proletarian wage earners) who have no free capital to engage in reckless speculation and are under the high pressure of living expenses and have no surplus at home. How will they live in the future? Under the banner of "selling inventory, applying for registration, and suspending business," they are frowning and sighing! No plan (and no plan) can be found. Many bosses may even arrange "throwing stones down a well" and carry out a "bold" layoff policy, and the employees will feel the tragic fate of the skin! What cannot be denied is, what should be sympathized with, what should be properly handled, and especially what is serious is: they all have the burden of parents, wives, and children. Even when they are employed and have a job, they still feel stretched, and they are worried that their　bodies cannot be fed, and that they cannot support their wives and children! What they can rely on to make ends meet is only the year-end distribution. If they encounter serious unemployment, then "they cannot carry burdens, and their hands cannot carry baskets." And behind them (father:) helpless to produce old father) mothers, wives, and children are crying and calling for cold! It is truly unbearable to speak of and unthinkable.) How many can raise funds to do small businesses?) Recently, many small yarn and cloth factories have also heard of closing down and dismissing their employees. (Is this something that could have been expected at the beginning? In that case, the increasingly serious problem of unemployment! The iron-like facts are in front of us, and we cannot deny that under the policy of pre-planning, managing funds, and striving to increase the production of yarn, cloth, and other industries, there are still such phenomena! The writer dares to appeal to the ruling authorities with sincerity to quickly improve the situation.</p>
<p>The most important thing for a government is to "grasp the hearts of the people." Being able to practice "what the people love, love; what the people hate, hate," and being able to grasp "the hearts of the people," the people will　be sincerely happy and obedient! What do you want the people to be happy and sincere　? At a minimum, everyone must be "settled and happy." Everyone must have a "stable life." Then they can cooperate with the new order. New　　. May my　clear and clever police be vigilant.</p>

<h3>The Current Situation of the Youyou Educational Institution for Nurturing Refugee Children</h3>
<p>— Doctor Wan</p>
<p>Youyou Educational Institution is a vibrant educational organization. It originated five years ago when homeless refugee children were sent from refugee shelters. The work within the institution is divided into three sections: general affairs, education, and production, which are executed separately. The general affairs section is further divided into document, accounting, supply, medical affairs, and storage departments. The production department is currently divided into rattan work and net knitting departments. Education　adopts a work-study system, and moral education starts with personal touching.</p>
<p>The institution has very strict plans for the personality development and livelihood skills of the children, and it has achieved good results. Children who have picked up bad habits in the lower levels of society in the streets and alleys are corrected one by one in the institution. On the other hand, in addition to teaching ordinary textbooks, more attention is paid to the children's personalities and interests, and correct guidance is given according to their respective instincts.</p>
<p>In order to take into account the livelihood problems of the children after they leave the institution, a vocational training course is specially added to the academic subjects, so that the employment skills of each graduate have a foundation. Enthusiastic people in society can also often promote students to enter certain advanced institutions and serve in the industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<p>The institution has reading　rooms, writing rooms, chess rooms, and billiard rooms, etc. Children" automatically read books, write, or play games, all in a very orderly and disciplined manner. This is by no means something that can be achieved by a day or two of education.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to the suffering of rising prices and the great shortage of food, the institution had the idea of moving to the countryside. Later, it found a suitable location in the rural area of Xu Gongqiao Town, Kunshan, and changed the general development　address. Because it was spacious and clean, suitable for farming and　, in January of this year, three teachers led more than 100 children to move to the countryside and establish the "Xu Gongqiao Youyou Branch". Here, one cannot help but recall the famous Xin'an Travel Group's alma mater, Xin'an Primary School. These children will never be bookworms who cannot distinguish between the five grains.</p>
<p>The Jing Nong of Youyou Education　Institution, which includes the expenses of both the main and branch institutions, requires more than 40,000 yuan per month. In view of the rising prices, this number is also constantly increasing. We know that the educational institution relies entirely on solicited donations and is extremely difficult. We hope that people with lofty ideals will not bear to see this good educational　institution stop midway, and can pool their efforts to support it together. The country will also thank you for nurturing the children.</p>
<h3>Dr. Zhu - Free Physical Examinations</h3>
<p>Lung disease specialist Dr. Zhu, whose clinic is located at 331 Avenue Albert, has the latest X-ray machine for tuberculosis screening. He can also bring the X-ray machine to patients' homes for fluoroscopy or photography at a low cost. He has donated ten X-ray fluoroscopy certificates. Poor and sick people can receive free fluoroscopy examinations through the introduction of this newspaper. If tuberculosis is found, artificial pneumothorax can also be performed for free. Dr. Zhu's service to society is commendable.</p>
<h3>Free Schools and Aid</h3>
<p>Zhongxin Primary School, located at 56 Yongkang Lane, Alabaste Road, North Block, New Garbage Bridge in this city, has been cooperating with the Baojia in the area to establish a free night school since the fall of last year. It does not charge tuition fees and teaches poor students, most of whom are child laborers in factories and children of peddlers. In the past year, there have been more than 400 students in the school. Since the beginning of this semester, due to lack of funds, classes have not yet started, but the school's former students have come to the school one after another to request that it continue to be opened. The school's budget for this semester is at least 5,000 yuan. The school hopes that public-spirited people in society will donate generously so that poor students can continue their studies and not drop out halfway.</p>
<p>In order to save　poor students, Nansu Middle School has specially added free places, a total of three classes in junior high school and three to five places in senior high school. It is heard that the school has started classes on September 7th, with the address at the intersection of Hartung Road and Fuxu Road.</p>
<h3>Birth Control Guidance</h3>
<p>The Chinese Health Association has recently set up a birth control guidance department, which is presided over by expert doctors. It uses the latest invented safe methods, without surgery, and without any pain. Moreover, it can restore fertility at any time, solving a difficult problem for those who suffer from having too many children. The association's address is at 996 Jing'an Temple Road, Magi Building, and the time is from 3 pm to 5 pm.</p>
<p>Job Seeker - Zhu Jielu, a poor scholar from northern Jiangsu, is 39 years old and has worked in commerce, politics, law, and newspaper circles for 15 years. He is a devout Buddhist. He is now unemployed due to his old parents and poverty. He earnestly requests help from enthusiastic people in society. The jobs he is seeking are:　document clerk in a business or firm　, scribe of Buddhist scriptures　, chanting Buddhist scriptures　, small-scale industrial and commercial business, requiring low capital and small profits. Contact address: Wuwei Yinxin, c/o Zhu Weiyin, Zhen Taifeng Main Branch, Zhuan Nong Bridge, Wuxi.</p>
<h3>The Street Children Adoption Problem</h3>
<p>— Meng Liu</p>
<p>The adoption of street vagrant children should be organized quickly in various social charity projects. This will not only make the city cleaner and tidier, but also have great significance in health protection, agricultural production increase, unemployment relief, crime prevention, and public education. Here are some points I have seen:</p>
<p>Organization　Establish a joint government-civilian charity group to undertake the matter, so that we can gather the opinions of the sufferers, which can be used for appeal.</p>
<p>Funds　The funds should not be donated solely by the people, and should be borne entirely by the city, in order to strengthen the citizens' belief in the government. If it is insufficient due to the large scale, we can then raise funds from public-spirited people.</p>
<p>Location　They should all be accommodated in the countryside, so that they can help with farm work, get used to rural life, and learn agricultural skills. If we are worried that there are currently no houses in the rural areas near Shanghai that can accommodate a large number of children, we may as well temporarily build thatched huts, roughly like the way Shanghai accommodated refugees during the incident.</p>
<p>Provisions　All their clothing, housing, and residence should not be better than those of rural children. For example, shoes and socks are rarely used in Chinese farmhouses, so the children we take in do not need to use cinnamon socks often. Food can also be mainly made of mixed grains. In short, within the scope of not writing healthy development, the provisions for the children we take in should be saved as much as possible, so that the children can get used to a frugal rural life.</p>
<p>Discipline　The accommodation of children should be divided into two types, one is the management of adopted children, who can be taken back by their relatives after the expiration of the period; the other is the management of street vagrant children. The methods of discipline should also be divided into two types. For the latter, special moral education should be implemented to vigorously change their wandering habits, to love production work, and in addition to appropriate labor, education should also be carried out from labor to gradually cultivate specialized talents in agriculture and other fields.</p>
<p>Hygiene　Farmers often suffer from dysentery, red eyes, and other diseases. This is the evil of lacking hygiene conditions. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases is also what the children's accommodation organization in the countryside should pay attention to.</p>
