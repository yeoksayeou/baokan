<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">告高中及大學畢業生 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>關於助學運動，本報已迭有建議，屢加檢討。因爲國家需要人材之迫切，絕對不能任令有志靑年，爲了無力負担學費，便中途輟學。所以助學運動，値得提倡，並且希望政府和社會人士共同努力，以期爲國儲材。</p>
<p>目前因家境困難而失學的靑年，已不在少數，這是一件很嚴重的事。同時顯出有力入學者的幸運。至於能支持五六年乃至十餘年的時間，完成中學或大學的課程而畢業，當然更是難能可貴。這一輩「天之驕子」，應當如何自重，而國家社會應當如何加以愛護和策勵，指導他們升學和就業。因此我們便就這兩點略申所見，以爲高中及大學畢業生告。</p>
<p>（一）告準備升學諸君：由高中升入大學，這是在求學過程中，一個很重要的關鍵，因爲在這個時期裏的決定，直接可以影響個人的幸福，間接可以影響到國家社會的前途。當升學之際，最感到困難者有二：（甲）選擇科目，（乙）選擇學校。就甲項言之，各學校所包含的科目，奚止數十種，似乎無所適從。可是選擇的方法，至爲簡單，就是須以個人的興趣爲標準。大學敎育，貴在自動研究，而自動硏究學問的原動力，厥爲與趣。否則，學不爲己，敷衍塞責而已，興趣所在，便赴之以全力，固不必問其將來用途之廣狹。因爲中國任何人村都感缺乏，祗患探討之不深，母息學成而不用。不過書本上的智識，大都是空泛的表面的，所以同時須注意實習騐證，一方面允須培養國家意識，澈底認識時局，然後方能得到深刻的學問，堅定遠大的志趣，而造成一個任重致遠之才。就乙項而論，中國各大學中，能與各先進國的大學並駕齊驅，堪稱學府而無愧者，眞是鳳毛麟角。尤其自中日事變以後，各學校之實質更遜於前，亦是無可諱言的事實，所以選擇學校，切不可過苛，致感失望。學校雖是簡陋，可是他的設備，我們巳經利用了多少，敎師縱然淺薄，可是他的敎訓，我們究竟接受了多少。須用君子責己也嚴的態度，時加探討，則失望的情緒轉變爲愧疚的情緒，此不特對於學業上有所進步，就是對於修養上亦有所裨益。同校同師之學生，未必程度盡同，若是自己不求上進，一切都推諉於學校，徒見其不知自省，甚或見異思遷，則影響於學業更大。至於大學畢業生，以往都以出國留學爲升學的途徑，以外國的學位爲深造的目標。這本是反響着我國大學敎育不如人的事實，也就是我國敎育界的一件可恥之事。怎樣改善我國的學校，和怎樣改善留學制度，這都出於本文範圍，不能詳論。不過目前受戰事的影響，出國留學，暫不可能，這並非大學畢業生的不幸，而正可以利用這時期，對於中國各方面情形，求一準確的認識。一旦有負笈他邦的機會，便可吸收切於實用的智識，負起文化交流之使命。待將來歸國，必能提供合於國情的建議與改進。比之徒騖虛聲之輩，隔靴搔癢，實不可同日而語。</p>
<p>（二）告準備就業諸君：高中畢業生初入社會，就一般言不過擔任一部分而且很小的工作，人家未必把你們放在心目之中。可是切勿因此而妄自菲薄，憤懣懈意。須知社會上之組織，却以高中或高職畢業生爲中堅份子，做成承上起下的一環。無論在政府機關或私人企業，任何計劃之推行與實施，決非少數高級人員所能躬親。故膏澤之及於萬民，事業之發皇昌盛，有賴於中級幹部者，至深且鉅。自己須認淸所處的地位，方能自尊自娛，方能敬業樂業。縱有時受到物質上的委屈，亦當尋覔正當途徑，以謀解決。若以怠業爲報復手段，則損入不利己，愚不可及。至於大學畢業生，目前既少留學的機會，則惟有考慮就業。否則坐失良機，而遊蕩成性，後悔莫及。在就業之初，第一要降低生活的慾望。因爲目前能在大學畢業的學生，大多數出於優裕舒適的家庭，須知這種享受，是父母的庇廕，從自立之日起，應由自己奮鬭，不復留戀已往，從艱難困苦中，創造新生活。第二要改變處世的態度，當今學校能注重學業者，已不可多得，而對於待人接物，素不講求。平時對於師長，且不執弟子之禮，對於同事，或更流露傲慢，倘不從此痛革前非，虛懷若谷，將到處遭人厭惡，自絕生路。第三要認識時代，這是最爲緊要。現在正是全世界烽火燎原之日，也正是人類受磨鍊之時，切不可咨嗟太息生不逢辰，尤不可無病而呻銷磨壯志，要知遇到這樣的大時代，眞是千載難逢，亦正是有志之士爲國家社會謀福利的機會，困難愈多，阻力愈大，愈當發揚蹈厲，豈容袖手旁觀。當一切重大的責任，需要我們來担負之時，須用理智回顧歷史，用熱情把握現實，母立異以爲高，逆情以千譽！</p>

<h3 id="c2">日海軍機聯合大編隊　繼續攻擊倫特巴島　炸沉及擊毀美船艦十四艘　並重創摩勒斯比軍事設施 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　日大本營本日下午二時三十分發表：日本航空部隊，於一日繼續攻擊倫特巴島方面敵軍，收獲綜合戰果如次：炸沉敵乙級巡洋艦一艘，炸毀乙級巡洋艦一艘，炸沉大型驅逐艦四艘及驅逐艦一艘，炸毀驅逐艦一艘，炸沉運輸船三艘，炸毀輸送船三艘，擊落敵機七十七架以上，我方有飛機三十一架未歸防。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　所羅門羣島方面。敵美軍隊於倫特巴島實行登陸作戰後，七月一日仍繼續以少數兵員及軍需資材運往該島。日海軍航空隊接獲此項報告後爲欲一舉將其殲滅起見乃以戰鬥轟炸機聯合大編隊，飛臨敵軍上空，是日敵軍亦以有力戰鬥機羣在空中警戒，但經日海軍機猛烈突擊，敵戰鬥機之陣容即完全崩亂，雙方戰鬥機羣乃即展開激烈空戰。日轟炸機隊則從容以敵巡洋艦，驅逐艦爲目標，作猛烈準確之轟炸，敵軍艦船之防禦砲火雖極熾烈，但因日機投彈準確，敵艦船頓陷混亂，轉瞬之問，日機即擊沉敵乙級巡洋艦一艘，重創一艘，又擊沉敵大型驅逐艦四艘，並擊落敵機七十七架。按敵方雖極力宣傳反攻，但敵軍在太平洋反攻作戰之基地，已悉在日航空部隊之強力行動圈內，因此敵之作戰行動已無隱秘，此爲該方面美軍反攻作戰之最大弱點，故敵運輸部隊今後必將在空·海兩方面蒙重創。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二日中央社電　據墨爾缽來電西南太平祥反軸軍司令部三日公布之戰况，又循例承認有輕微損害，內謂，自六月三十日美軍在新喬治亞羣島之倫特巴島登陸作戰以來，日本戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊，即連日攻擊該島美軍，反軸心軍在空戰中，共喪失飛機十七架。</p>

<p>阿根廷京城二日中央社電　日軍於西南太平洋之勇猛奮戰，已使美。澳軍爲之瞻寒。頃據新金山來電：新幾內亞戰綫美軍司令愛柴數巴中加中將，六月二十九日於澳洲某地出席在澳受訓之四百名美人軍官畢業典禮時，曾說明日軍之精强，謂日軍較之德·義軍尤爲强健，余曾聞一日兵於殺死三十二名反軸心兵後始戰死，此足證日士兵之勇，又據密爾窩基電，「生活」雜誌經營者諾斯夫人（前曾被選爲衆院議員），二十九日於密爾窩基婦女俱樂部演說時亦謂：四南太平洋之反軸心軍　性雖大，而所得極少，彼謂美軍於太平洋戰綫徒丟失廣大地域，而一無所得，如一島嶼之爭奪，往往得不償失，而太平洋反攻作戰遲延之結果，亦予日軍以巡一步强化其佔領地之時間。</p>

<p>柏林二日中央社電　海通社訊：德國在增强西歐海岸之防事中，已將海峽羣島之格恩賽。傑賽。阿爾特納及薩克各島改成强固之要塞，此數島在三年前被德軍佔領後，即已成爲前哨。格恩賽曾表現其長程大砲之威力，將屢决乘黑夜偷渡之英船擊退，該島長十四公里，闊八公里，其首府聖彼得港有英僑一七·〇〇〇名。</p>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　英首相邱吉爾三十日於倫敦市政廳演說時曾謂，反軸心軍將於地中海及其他各地展開大規模作戰，故一般觀察英·美兩國或將於今後四個月內，實行歐洲登陸作戰，但德政界人士認爲，歐洲登陸作戰，實非易舉。</p>
<p>七條路綫</p>
<p>軍事消息靈通方面人士，對反軸心軍於歐洲登陸地點一事，一日表示意見謂：（一）反軸心軍或將進攻挪威海岸，但一九四〇年四月，英·法聯軍於挪威本土登陸時，挪威軍則與聯軍協力，而少數德軍即將英·法聯軍擊退，目前挪威方面之德軍，實力已比前大增，且聯軍再無挪威軍之助矣。（二）聯結斯加基拉克黑耳郭　島及北佛里四安羣島之三角地帶，尤不適於反軸心軍之登陸作戰，因登陸部隊進至該處，必遭德軍自兩側夾攻之威脅而陷於絕境。（三）反軸心軍或越杜佛海峡實施其登陸，但德軍於該方而已完成萬全準備，此地德軍配有最新式之防禦武器，並保有極周密之連絡路綫，大西洋沿岸之堅固防禦設備，亦悉告完成，故德軍必能堅守該地。（四）北非之法愧儡政機於英·美兩軍援助下，或企圖自地中海方而進攻法本土，但法南岸之軸心軍據守築成之堅固防禦錢，必可堅守戰術上之優越地位，使無可乘之機。（五）反軸心軍企圖於地中海中部之數處展開登陸作戰，以期結成第二戰綫，目前並正本此方針於該方面集結海·陸·空軍有力部隊，但因軸心軍之一切準備，亦已完成，故與突尼西亞之形勢完全相異。（六）邱吉爾雖知上次大戰時，於加里玻利登陸作戰曾遭過慘敗，但此次渠或仍企圖進行第二加里玻利作戰亦未可知，但軸心軍於一九四一年五月時，僅以數師之兵力，於極短期間即將南斯拉夫及希臘兩國軍隊擊潰，並將英派遣軍逐出歐洲大陸及克里特島。（七）蘇軍之動向與上述之反軸心軍登陸作戰企圖有密切關連，故殊堪重視。</p>
<p>德方對策</p>
<p>反軸心軍方面爲期蘇軍能與反軸心軍之登陸作戰呼應起見，故始終盼望蘇軍於東綫轉取攻勢，但德軍方面對於蘇軍企圖，已有萬全準備，德軍當局關於上述之反軸心軍登陸作戰企圖，久已詳加檢討，而確立萬全對策，刻正嚴密監視反軸心軍之動向中，至其對策的有次列四點：（一）動員德本土及歐洲之總力，以努力戰爭。（二）根據某種考慮，使精銳部隊尤其空軍得有特別休息，養精蓄銳，以待良機。（三）新銳潛艇隊。（四）德軍具有所謂內錢作戰之優越地位。</p>

<p>里斯本二日中央社電　據海通社維希負責方面稱。法屬馬丁尼克島之正式移交與美國，雖未成爲事實，但大致在最近之將來即將實行。馬丁尼克總督洛貝爾與美國進行談判之主要原因，乃由於美國施行飢饉封鎖之可怖效果及兒意因缺乏牛乳而致死亡者之衆多。該總督現時仍絕對遵守維希之訓令，渠雖被環境所迫而屈服於反軸心國之意旨、但法政府對此事之態度，並不因而改變。</p>

<p>日本大使館上海事務所發言人廣田情報部長，於昨日下午三時，在循例舉行招待本市中國新聞記者團常會報道席上，發表近代作戰之特徵，須樹立總力戰體系，對政治經濟思想均有連繫性，闡述綦詳，最後冀盼中國民衆，遵行汪主席昭示同甘共苦之精神，由理論進而爲實踐，至五時半始畢。茲摘大要如次：</p>
<p>獨立自主</p>
<p>廣田情報部長首對交還公共租界問題發言，略謂關於交還公共租界協定，業已簽訂就緒，定期八月一日實施交還國府接管，故今後公共租界行政機構及行政機，即將移歸市府。至交還租界及撤廢治外法權，乃在驅除英美勢力，完成中國之獨立自主，但欲全部排除英美勢力於中國之境，猶有待乎大東亞戰爭勝利完遂後，則中國可以完成完全之獨立自主。易言之，我人仍當決心排除英美勢力及擊滅英美勢力而後止。進一步言，關於大東亞戰爭之目的既爲擊減英美勢力與謀東亞民族獨立而作戰，斯項問題，不但爲日本一國，乃爲東亞民族十萬萬人民之問題，亦即東亞十萬萬人民應共負責任。爲完成大東亞戰爭，應按照本身各個實力以發揮力量，進而樹立總力體系，爰特提出此當前問題，請大家來體認近代作戰之特徵，</p>
<p>集中力量</p>
<p>近代作戰之特徵，不僅於武力作戰，且對後方國民的政治，經濟，思想等力量，須集中一體化，是爲總力戰，故後方之政治戰，經濟戰，思想戰之綜合，能決定武力戰之成敗。無論軍隊如何强有力，然無政治經濟思想總力爲後盾，輒有敗北之虞。例如法國因內部政治之不統一，派別紛歧，尤以特戈爾與季勞之爭鬥，軍隊雖强，但未能獲取勝利地位。又如美國之經濟，雖有煤礦頗多，但因五十萬工人之大罷工，結果未克開發嗚，其數萬萬噸之煤斤。不能產運，試問如何可以加强作戰力量？是故欲謀發揮作戰勝利起見。須將後方一切資源，予以組織化，始克有效。再述思想戰，應如何使國民思想之奮發，堅決信念，埋頭苦幹，以確保最後勝利之來臨。</p>
<p>堅強信念</p>
<p>以目前軸心國最後勝利之信念愈形加强，益增發揮總力戰之決意，而反軸心之舊觀念殊屬非是。蓋彼輩以軸心國與反軸心國領土物資之相比，謂軸心國領土小，物資少，顯示地位之衰落，但在實際上作比例，却不可以此表面而予確定成敗，我人應改作如是觀：軸心以政治經濟思想之總合力量，與反軸心比較，則進步多多，是以本人對軸心國之勝利信念，抱有堅强決意。此次大東亞獨立解放戰爭，武力作戰之工作，業由日軍負責，國府正規軍與在華日軍。已協力作戰，南方則泰國軍隊已參加緬甸作戰，他如馬來半島印度人民，亦編制部隊，以參加南方作戰。今再復以軸心問政治戰討論，日本對華已實行交還租界及撤廢治外法權，對緬菲亦將予以獨立，對爪哇已予參政，故大東亞民族已全體認識東亞新秩序建設之意義。經濟方面，大東亞各民族，已站在本身立塲，先謀自給自食，並在各方之軍需資材生產上言，已有般民衆，自動供給人力。思想方面作戰之目的，在建設東亞新秩序之意義，日益明確，而在一般民衆之作戰意志，則日益昻激而加强矣。以是否人可言，全東亞十萬萬民族之總合力量愈高，最後勝利之期愈速蒞臨，故以總力戰之情形所觀，在戰爭各方，應樹立總力戰爭體系，以發揮總力戰之宏效。</p>
<p>努力實踐</p>
<p>最後單述中國在大東亞戰爭中、所分担之責任，應在何處，以武力而言，國府正規軍與日軍之協力作戰，在海軍方面，新海軍已作水上警備，故目前所負担主要者，當爲經濟。我人可言，目前中國之經濟，應再予組織至完全戰時體制，其組織愈堅確保最後勝利，亦愈迅速，故再組織戰時體制化。臻於完善，以決定最後勝利，並決定東亞民族之獨立自主解放。最後深盼中國國民，一體遵行汪主席所昭示之同甘共苦之精神，由理論而進爲全面實踐云云。</p>

<p>— 馮節</p>
<p>關於友邦日本實行交還上海公共租界，已於上月三十日在中日雙方有關當局主持之下，完成了簽字儀式，我國正式收囘上部公共租界，到下月一日就可完全實現。在這近百年的時間中·英美以上海公共租界爲共實施侵略整個中國的據點，眞是如同先使中國的心贓腐蝕起。所以中國在此百年中，體力與心力無論怎樣，都覺恢復不過來，毒害眞是厲害極了。</p>
<p>國父臨終時，昭告我們廢除不平等條約，必須要在最短期間促其實現，如今友邦日本眞切實踐，協助我國完成獨立自主的諾言，於本年一月九日，與我國訂立關於交還租界及撤除治外法權的協定，到三月三十日，就實施全部交還日本在中國的專管租界，最近更實踐協定中第四條約規定，於是我國收囘上海公共租界終於成爲事實，百年來英美侵略中國的據點，至此完全得以劃除。</p>
<p>現在我們面臨這件劃時代的事蹟，本人覺得就上海的市民責任來說，至少應該做到下列二點：第一，是今後上海市民應該每一個貢獻其體力心力或物力協助政府，完遂參戰的使命。第二，是今後上海市民應該每一個協助政府當局，關於治安文化及建設方面，都要努力推進其既定計劃，使之　於盡善盡美之境。</p>
<p>至於上海法租界之交囘問題，我們爲了要　海的行政主權完整，所以也盼　能於八月一日由法當局自動交囘我國，這樣，則中法兩國的友誼必可由此而愈益增進，我們相信法當局之賢明，也一定能夠看到此點，本人在處裏希望法當局予以實踐。</p>

<p>滬西警察局潘達，自長政以來，對滬西警政，頗著勛續。昨日下午四時，潘局長特在上海電臺，向全國廣播滬西區內目前重要施政，及滬四警權收歸市府辦理經過曁滬四警政概况。茲將演講原詞分誌如次：</p>
<p>警政概況</p>
<p>諸位同胞，兄弟忝任上海特別市滬西警察局局長，今天要向諸位報告上海滬西區驚政的概况。兄弟最先要說的，就是現在滬西驚察權已經被中國政府收囘了。滬四在上海開闢租界的時候，本是屬於上海轄境，不料租界一再擴充越界所築的路，竟達二十八條之多，以致警權不一，治安不確立。</p>
<p>民國十六年，上海市政府成立，開始交涉收同，後來傳前市長抱持決心，經過無戰波折，並經友邦日本斡旋，乃　民國二十九年二月十六日成立了臨時警務協定。</p>
<p>陳市長到任後，繼續交涉。滬西警權始得合理斛決，於民國三十年二月一日與公共租界工部局訂立了「滬四特警組織章則，」簡稱「滬四特警協定」，根據這個協定，在同年三月十五日，成立滬西特警總署，兄弟就担任總署署長，管轄滬西全區驚務，但是特警總署有工部局推荐人員一百七十九人在內。</p>
<p>收歸經過</p>
<p>自從大東亞戰爭爆發後，上海英美勢力消滅，民國三十一年五月一日，市政府與工部局雙方同意將協定廢止，滬西越界築路警察權，完全收囘歸市政府辦理。滬四特警總署，於五月十一日改組爲「</p>
<p>上海特別市滬四警察局，」兄弟繼續担任局長、這一段事實，就是滬四警權收囘的經過，是中國歷史上値得紀錄的。</p>
<p>現在要講滬西警政的設施。上面兄弟說過滬西爲了警權不統一，地方不能安甯，烟館林立，賭塲遍地，盜匪充斥，滬西被稱爲「歹土」，特警總署成立後，在二個月短時期內，即將烟館賭塲完全禁絕，匪徒亦不敢蠢動，從此治安確立、變成「樂土」，這是我們値得報告諸位的。其他重要施政，遠有淸查戶口，辦理平米，統制物資，舉辦保甲等、，都有極大成功。</p>
<p>請到警察本身，大家能夠忠心服務，恪守命令，廉潔奉公，刻苦耐勞，愛護善良，自今以後，還要加倍努力，希望有更好的成績再來報告諸位。</p>

<p>— 羅沉</p>
<p>一個自命樂天派的朋友，在我底紀念冊上寫了這麼一段話——</p>
<p>『假使你是那光芒萬丈的太陽，那又有什麼稀奇呢？在有色鏡片下看來，也不過只是暗黑的一輪罷了。何况你並不是太陽！還是鄭板橋所說：難得糊塗好。』</p>
<p>這是他底人生觀，他底處世方針。</p>
<p>據說，這樣他就快樂了，因爲一切苦惱的事，都不再來麻煩他。好像一個喝醉了酒的人，眼前的世界對他只是模模糊糊地，看不淸楚，那末『苦惱』，在他也不過是一些模糊的影像，於是也就無所謂『苦惱』了。</p>
<p>然而，我看，他實在並不懂得什麽眞的快樂。</p>
<p>有誰眞地喝醉過酒嗎？那他一定就會知道那剛醒來時的感覺——空虛，難受。懊悔着：『我怎地又喝醉了，讓寶貴的靑春，在迷濛中白白地虛擲了！』</p>
<p>醉酒總沒有醉一輩子的。你不能使自己永遠在胡塗中討生活，因爲，許多『現實』的事不讓你胡塗。你餓了，你的確沒有飯吃，你能說：「胡塗些吧，我不餓？』你冷了，你的確沒有錢買衣服，你能說：『胡塗些吧，我不冷。』——？如果那樣，你只有餓死，凍死！</p>
<p>從胡塗裏找快樂，是有錢人——並且是在人生的戰塲上吃了敗仗的有錢人底處世之道。</p>
<p>我要這麽說——</p>
<p>『假使你只是一顆小星星，那又有什麽可以自卑的呢？雖然小，在黑夜裏，多少也給行路的人一個辨認方向的幫助。</p>
<p>『或許，你連星星也不是，——就算是一點小小的燭光吧！在沒有電燈的地方，人們不是也就在燭光下工作嗎？</p>
<p>最怕的是——你一心只想做太陽，或是更勝於太陽的束西，——那常然辦不到，於是你灰心了，頹喪了，想用『胡塗」來麻醉自己，結果，連燭光也做不成。』</p>
<h3 id="c58">享福與吃苦 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 東浦</p>
<p>年紀大的人想享福，年紀輕的也想享福，人人的欲望　是對準享福。看見別人享福，便羨慕長很，假使享不到福，便嘆命苦福薄。</p>
<p>人人只望做得「人上人」不願去吃「苦中苦」。</p>
<p>擁有祖傳遺產。囤貨發財的人，坐享優越的生活權利，他們用不着吃苦。也想不到有苦可吃。這是會享福的「人上人」。而是社會國家之蟲，如果，人人都是坐享幸福。那末、社會國家還有什麽進步呢？</p>
<h3 id="c59">鷄 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 沈沈</p>
<p>秀寶在夢中驚醒，不知什麼一囘事，戰慄地在床上不敢作聲，阿坤的妻。等到阿坤牽去了，嗚嗚咽咽地哭起來。秀寶揉着惺忪的睡眼，披了衣服，走下床跑到她母親身旁，也跟着流淚，一邊從她母親的口中斷斷續續地知道一些就是剛才來捉鷄這憫人一起去的。豆光燈下，母女倆凄楚地對泣着。一會阿坤妻說：</p>
<p>「秀寶，你先去　吧　我要等你爸回來！」秀寶搖搖頭不肯，說：</p>
<p>「媽，爸到那裏去的？我同媽一起去找找好不好？」</p>
<p>我也不曉得呀！那裏去找呢？」阿坤妻更加嗚咽着。</p>
<p>約摸一個鐘頭光景，鎭上的李鎭長，同着本甲的陸甲長忽忽忙忙地跑到阿坤家裏，踏進門，李鎭長就說：「阿坤嫂，你們怎麽好好地會闖出這價禍來，這年頭拿檢桿子的是不好惹的。我們都好端端的在家裏預備安息，突然司令部派人傳去，說阿坤有通匪嫌疑，家裏藏着槍械，要我們負責查出。這椿事如何了結呢？」半嚮大家都沒有說話。</p>
<p>「我們從司令部裏出來的時候，看見阿坤哭喪着臉，雙手反縛在屋角裏的柱頭上，說不定已經吃過苦了。我們走出門時，一個勤務兵跟出來，關照我們好好的想法子。我看還是忍痛的張羅一點錢，犒賞犒賞，免得阿坤在裏邊受苦，阿坤嫂，你想怎樣？」李鎭長慢吞吞地地這樣說着。</p>
<p>「多謝你們照顧，我是不懂事，只要阿坤能夠同來，都聽你們替找辦吧！」阿坤嫂眼淚盈盈的哀求着。</p>
<p>咳！我當了這份鎭長的差使，氣也受得夠了。這一囘的事，還不是同上春張家伯的事一樣嗎？總而言之，阿坤倒的大霉，我們倒的小霉，還有什麼話說。要不然把人打得皮開肉爛，結果遼是要犒賞了事的。照我的經騐，今天夜裏了結的好，明天一傳出去，就難辦了，」李鎭長憑他的經騐，又說出了他的意見。</p>
<p>「你家裏有多少錢，我們大家凑凑，趕快去吧。阿坤嫂，你趕緊想想法子呢！」陸甲長催促阿坤嫂想法錢</p>
<p>「我……我……我家裏那裏有錢，阿坤病了三個月剛好，已經欠了不少債，實在沒法想。」阿坤嫂嗚咽着</p>
<p>「那是不成的，空口說白話，總是不成的，我替你想一個法子，河東黃大伯處，或者可以說說情，借一筆　，不過要抵押品的。我們兩個人替你保一保，你家裏有沒有好一點的衣服，或是銀器，可以作押嗎？」李鎭長邊說邊看阿坤嫂的可憐樣子，也萬分難過。</p>
<p>「衣服早已當光了。僅有的秀寶聘親來的一套銀索子，剛才已經給穿灰色布的人取了去，實在一點沒法子，還是你們替我出一個主意吧！」阿坤嫂說着。（三）</p>

<h3 id="e1">A Message to Graduating High School and University Students <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the student aid movement, this newspaper has repeatedly offered suggestions and reviews. Because the nation urgently needs talent, we must not allow ambitious young people to drop out of school due to an inability to afford tuition. Therefore, the student aid movement is worthy of promotion, and we hope that the government and society will work together to cultivate talent for the country.</p>
<p>Currently, a significant number of young people are out of school due to financial difficulties, which is a serious issue. At the same time, it highlights the fortunate position of those who can afford to attend school. It is even more commendable to be able to complete secondary or university studies and graduate after five or six, or even more than ten years. How should this generation of "favored children of heaven" value themselves, and how should the nation and society care for, encourage, and guide them in their further education and employment? Therefore, we will briefly express our views on these two points to the graduating high school and university students.</p>
<p>(1) A Message to Those Preparing for Further Education: Entering university from high school is a crucial turning point in the learning process, because the decisions made during this period can directly affect individual happiness and indirectly affect the future of the nation and society. The greatest difficulties encountered when entering university are: (A) choosing a subject, and (B) choosing a school. Regarding (A), each school offers dozens of subjects, which may seem overwhelming. However, the selection method is very simple: it must be based on individual interests. University education values independent research, and the driving force behind independent research is interest. Otherwise, learning will not be for oneself, but merely perfunctory. If there is interest, then devote all your efforts to it, regardless of the breadth of its future applications. Because China feels a lack of everything, the only concern is whether the investigation is deep enough, and there is no fear of learning being useless. However, knowledge in books is mostly empty and superficial, so at the same time, attention must be paid to practical experience and verification. On the one hand, it is also necessary to cultivate national consciousness and thoroughly understand the current situation, so that one can obtain profound knowledge, firm and far-reaching ambitions, and become a talent capable of undertaking important tasks. Regarding (B), among Chinese universities, very few can truly stand shoulder to shoulder with the universities of advanced countries and be worthy of the name of an academic institution. Especially since the Sino-Japanese War, the substance of each school has deteriorated, which is an undeniable fact. Therefore, when choosing a school, do not be overly critical, lest you feel disappointed. Although the school may be simple, how much of its facilities have we utilized? Even if the teachers are superficial, how much of their teachings have we actually accepted? One must use the strict attitude of a gentleman examining oneself, and constantly explore and question. Then, the feeling of disappointment will turn into a feeling of guilt, which will not only benefit one's studies but also one's self-cultivation. Students from the same school and with the same teachers may not necessarily have the same level of achievement. If one does not strive for self-improvement and blames everything on the school, it only shows that one does not know how to reflect on oneself, or even changes one's mind easily, which will have a greater impact on studies. As for university graduates, in the past, studying abroad was the path to further education, and foreign degrees were the goal of advanced studies. This reflects the fact that university education in our country is inferior to others, which is a shameful thing for the education sector in our country. How to improve our country's schools and how to improve the system of studying abroad are beyond the scope of this article and cannot be discussed in detail. However, studying abroad is temporarily impossible due to the current impact of the war. This is not a misfortune for university graduates, but an opportunity to gain an accurate understanding of all aspects of China. Once there is an opportunity to study abroad, one can absorb practically useful knowledge and take on the mission of cultural exchange. When returning to the country in the future, one will be able to provide suggestions and improvements that are in line with the national conditions. This is incomparable to those who pursue empty fame, who are like scratching an itch from afar.</p>
<p>(2) A Message to Those Preparing for Employment: When high school graduates first enter society, they generally only undertake a portion of a very small job, and people may not pay attention to you. However, do not underestimate yourself or become resentful and slack off because of this. You must know that the organization of society relies on high school or vocational school graduates as the backbone, forming a link between the top and the bottom. Whether in government agencies or private enterprises, the implementation of any plan cannot be done by a small number of senior personnel alone. Therefore, the spread of benefits to the people and the flourishing of careers depend on middle-level cadres to a great extent. One must recognize one's own position in order to respect and enjoy oneself, and to be dedicated and happy in one's work. Even if one is sometimes subjected to material grievances, one should seek legitimate ways to resolve them. If one uses idleness as a means of retaliation, it will harm oneself and not benefit others, which is extremely foolish. As for university graduates, since there are currently few opportunities to study abroad, one can only consider employment. Otherwise, one will miss the opportunity and become habitually idle, which will lead to regret. When starting employment, the first thing is to lower one's desire for material comforts. Because most of the students who can graduate from university today come from affluent and comfortable families, one must know that this kind of enjoyment is due to the protection of one's parents. From the day one becomes independent, one should strive on one's own and no longer be nostalgic for the past, and create a new life from hardship. The second thing is to change one's attitude towards the world. Nowadays, it is rare to find schools that focus on academics, and they do not pay attention to dealing with people. Usually, they do not treat teachers with the respect of a student, and they may even show arrogance towards colleagues. If they do not thoroughly correct their past mistakes and maintain an open mind, they will be disliked everywhere and cut off their own path to success. The third thing is to recognize the times, which is the most important. Now is the time when the flames of war are raging around the world, and it is also the time when humanity is being tested. One must not lament one's ill fate or moan without illness and waste one's ambitions. One must know that encountering such a great era is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and it is also an opportunity for ambitious people to seek benefits for the nation and society. The more difficulties and obstacles there are, the more one should be motivated and not stand idly by. When all the major responsibilities need us to shoulder them, we must use reason to review history and use passion to grasp reality. Do not be different for the sake of being high-minded, and do not go against the grain for the sake of seeking fame!</p>

<h3 id="e2">### Japanese Naval Air Force Joint Formation Continues Attacking Rantepao Island, Sinking and Destroying 14 American Ships, and Heavily Damaging Military Facilities in Port Moresby <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM today: Japanese air force units continued to attack enemy forces in the Rantepao Island area on the 1st, achieving the following comprehensive results: Sunk one enemy Class B cruiser, destroyed one Class B cruiser, sunk four large destroyers and one destroyer, destroyed one destroyer, sunk three transport ships, destroyed three transport ships, shot down more than 77 enemy aircraft. 31 of our aircraft did not return to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 1st, Central News Agency Telegram: Solomon Islands area. After enemy American troops carried out landing operations on Rantepao Island, they continued to transport a small number of troops and military supplies to the island on July 1st. Upon receiving this report, the Japanese naval air force, in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop, dispatched a large joint formation of fighter-bombers to fly over the enemy. On that day, the enemy also had a strong group of fighter planes on alert in the air, but after a fierce attack by the Japanese naval air force, the enemy fighter formation completely collapsed, and the two sides' fighter formations immediately engaged in fierce air combat. The Japanese bomber squadrons calmly targeted enemy cruisers and destroyers, carrying out fierce and accurate bombing. Although the enemy warships' defensive artillery fire was extremely intense, the Japanese aircraft dropped bombs accurately, causing the enemy warships to fall into chaos. In an instant, the Japanese aircraft sank one enemy Class B cruiser, heavily damaged one, and sunk four enemy large destroyers, and shot down 77 enemy aircraft. It is reported that although the enemy is vigorously publicizing a counter-offensive, the enemy's base for counter-offensive operations in the Pacific is entirely within the powerful action range of the Japanese air force. Therefore, the enemy's operational actions have no secrecy, which is the biggest weakness of the American military's counter-offensive operations in this area. Therefore, the enemy's transport units will inevitably suffer heavy damage in the air and at sea in the future.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: According to a telegram from Melbourne, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters announced the battle situation on the 3rd, and once again routinely admitted to minor damage, stating that since the American military landed on Rantepao Island in the New Georgia Islands on June 30th, the Japanese fighter-bomber joint formation has attacked the American military on the island for days in a row. The Anti-Axis Forces lost a total of 17 aircraft in air combat.</p>
<p>Lisbon, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: Melbourne News: The Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters announced yesterday that Japanese aircraft bombed Port Moresby on June 30th, causing extensive damage to military facilities in the area.</p>
<h3 id="e3">### The United States Admits to Naval Vessel Losses Totalling 101 Ships <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: Washington News: The US Navy Department admitted that since the start of the war, the United States has lost a total of 101 warships, including one battleship, four aircraft carriers, one heavy cruiser, 28 destroyers, and nine submarines. The Navy Department's communique yesterday stated: The American transport ship USS McCawley was hit by a Japanese torpedo in the battle of Rantepao Island in the Solomon Islands, and was later sunk by a Japanese submarine.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: The fierce fighting of the Japanese military in the Southwest Pacific has caused the American and Australian armies to feel cold. According to a recent telegram from San Francisco: Lieutenant General Eichsel, Commander of the American Forces on the New Guinea front, said on June 29th at the graduation ceremony of 400 American military officers being trained in Australia in a certain location in Australia that the Japanese military is strong, saying that the Japanese military is even stronger than the German and Italian armies. I once heard that a Japanese soldier died in battle only after killing 32 Anti-Axis soldiers. This is sufficient evidence of the bravery of the Japanese soldiers. According to a telegram from Milwaukee, Mrs. Knowles, the operator of "Life" magazine (formerly elected as a member of the House of Representatives), also said at a speech at the Milwaukee Women's Club on the 29th: The Anti-Axis Forces in the South Pacific, although large in number, have gained very little. She said that the American military has lost vast territories on the Pacific front and has gained nothing. For example, the battle for an island often does not pay off. The delay in the Pacific counter-offensive operations also gives the Japanese military time to further strengthen its occupied territories.</p>
<h3 id="e4">### The Central Standing Committee Held a Regular Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>

Minister Lin Bosheng was appointed to attend the 160th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at the Central Party Headquarters on July 11th and report on the "Summer Training Situation for Young People."</p>
<h3 id="e5">### Zhang Gongquan Answers Questions from Reporters in Chongqing <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: The regular meetings between the Chongqing authorities and foreign reporters are now handled by Zhang Gongquan (Advisor to the Executive Yuan), Zhang Dingfan (Minister of Propaganda), and Wu Guozhen (Representative of the Minister of Foreign Affairs). According to news from Chongqing, Zhang Gongquan met with a group of foreign reporters on the 30th and answered questions about the recent situation in Chongqing, saying: The war is about to enter its seventh year. The problems of malicious inflation and rising prices caused by the coastal blockade, as well as the economic suffering, are becoming increasingly acute. He also mentioned the American coal miners' strike, saying that the United States is the arsenal of the Anti-Axis powers, so we are very concerned about the recent strike in the United States.</p>

<p>Tokyo, July 1st, Central News Agency Telegram: The Japanese Zaiban Hojin Greater East Asia Academy was established in Showa 16 (1941), with former Director of the East Asia Council's Central China Liaison Department, Tsuda Shizue, and the Naval Commander serving as Chairmen. Inaba Keiryō has been decided as the Dean, and Nagai Kanetaye as the Vice Dean. Japanese students will soon be selected from various universities, and after a report conference is held in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Beijing, the academy will officially open on September 1st. Its contribution to the understanding and unity of the two great nations of China and Japan is deeply anticipated.</p>
<h3 id="e8">### The Japanese Army in China Releases a Weekly Battle Report <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: The Japanese China Expeditionary Army released the following weekly battle report on July 3rd: Recently, the guerrillas of the Chongqing army disturbing the rear of the Japanese army seem to have increased slightly compared to before, but those who directly suffer losses are still the Chinese people. Since the spring of this year, there have been uprisings of the people in Inner Mongolia's Ikhe Zao League and the southwestern parts of Gansu and Guizhou provinces, as well as the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi. The reason is that after a long period of resistance, there is a shortage of food and other necessities in various places. In order to continue the war of resistance, Chongqing has forcibly conscripted soldiers and requisitioned materials, which has caused the people in various regions under its control to feel increasingly resentful. Although the Chongqing side has dispatched a considerable number of troops to suppress these uprisings, it is difficult to completely suppress them, and this has only deepened the hatred of the people. The Communist Party is further inciting the rioters from within, so the nature of the rioters has become more complex. In southern China, the Japanese army has been fiercely attacking the Chaozhou-Shantou area since the 15th of last month, with the main force of the 20th Independent Brigade of the Chongqing 7th War Zone, numbering 10,000 men. As of the 29th, 936 Chongqing soldiers were killed and 45 were captured. The Japanese army seized 18 heavy and light machine guns and is currently continuing to clear the area.</p>
<p>Taiyuan, July 2nd, Central News Agency Telegram: The elite units of the Japanese army recently conducted a mopping-up operation against the Chongqing Communists in the strategically important mountainous area of the eastern Taihang Mountains. From June 11th to the 20th, the following results were achieved: 37 Chongqing Communist corpses were abandoned, 114 prisoners were captured, and a large amount of ammunition, weapons, and food were seized.</p>

<h3 id="e23">German Occupation of the Channel Islands: Complete Fortification Makes Anti-Axis Operations in Europe Extremely Difficult <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Haisong News Agency reports: Germany, in reinforcing the defenses of the Western European coast, has transformed the Channel Islands of Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, and Sark into formidable fortresses. These islands, occupied by German forces three years ago, have become outposts. Guernsey has demonstrated the power of its long-range artillery, repelling numerous British ships attempting to cross under cover of darkness. The island is 14 kilometers long and 8 kilometers wide, with its capital, St. Peter Port, home to 17,000 British expatriates.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - British Prime Minister Churchill stated at London City Hall on the 30th that anti-Axis forces would launch large-scale operations in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. Therefore, it is generally observed that Britain and the United States may carry out a European landing operation within the next four months. However, German political figures believe that a European landing operation is by no means easy.</p>
<p>Seven Possible Routes</p>
<p>Informed military sources expressed their opinions on the location of an anti-Axis landing in Europe on the 1st, stating: (1) Anti-Axis forces may attack the Norwegian coast, but in April 1940, when British and French allied forces landed on the Norwegian mainland, the Norwegian army cooperated with the Allied forces, while a small number of German troops repelled the British and French allied forces. Currently, the German forces in Norway are much stronger than before, and the Allied forces will no longer have the assistance of the Norwegian army. (2) The triangular area connecting the Skagerrak, Kattegat, and the North Frisian Islands is particularly unsuitable for an anti-Axis landing operation, as landing troops entering this area would inevitably face the threat of a German pincer attack from both sides and be trapped in a desperate situation. (3) Anti-Axis forces may attempt to land across the Strait of Dover, but German forces have already completed thorough preparations in this area. The German forces here are equipped with the latest defensive weapons and maintain extremely comprehensive communication lines. The solid defensive installations along the Atlantic coast have also been completed, so the German forces will definitely be able to hold this area. (4) The French puppet regime in North Africa, with the support of British and American forces, may attempt to attack the French mainland from the Mediterranean, but the Axis forces guarding the fortified defense lines along the southern coast of France will definitely be able to maintain a strategically advantageous position, leaving no opportunity for exploitation. (5) Anti-Axis forces are attempting to launch landing operations at several locations in the central Mediterranean, hoping to form a second front. Currently, they are concentrating powerful naval, land, and air forces in this area according to this strategy, but because the Axis forces' preparations have also been completed, the situation is completely different from that in Tunisia. (6) Although Churchill knows that the landing operation at Gallipoli during the last World War ended in a disastrous defeat, it is still possible that he may attempt to conduct a second Gallipoli operation this time. However, in May 1941, the Axis forces, with only a few divisions, quickly defeated the armies of Yugoslavia and Greece and drove the British expeditionary forces out of mainland Europe and Crete. (7) The movements of the Soviet army are closely related to the aforementioned anti-Axis landing operation attempts, so they deserve special attention.</p>
<p>German Countermeasures</p>
<p>In order for the Soviet army to respond in coordination with the anti-Axis landing operation, the anti-Axis forces have always hoped that the Soviet army would launch an offensive on the Eastern Front. However, the German forces have made thorough preparations for the Soviet army's intentions. The German authorities have long examined the aforementioned anti-Axis landing operation attempts in detail and established thorough countermeasures, and are currently closely monitoring the movements of the anti-Axis forces. Their countermeasures include the following four points: (1) Mobilizing the total strength of Germany and Europe to strive for victory in the war. (2) Based on certain considerations, allowing elite troops, especially the air force, to have special rest and recuperation to await a good opportunity. (3) New submarine fleet. (4) The German army has the strategic advantage of so-called interior lines of operation.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Governor Robert of Martinique, a French West Indian island, had previously resisted the illegal demands of the United States to the best of his ability. Now, he has been forced to succumb to the pressure of the US government and has requested the US government to send a representative to reside permanently on the island. In the past, Governor Robert resolutely adhered to a policy of neutrality in an isolated and helpless state, regardless of the serious pressure from the United States. It is reported that this surrender is due to the island's blockade by the British and American navies, resulting in a severe shortage of supplies. Therefore, in order to alleviate the suffering of the general public, Robert has adopted this measure.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to German news sources: US Secretary of State Hull yesterday confirmed that the US Navy Department had received a message from High Commissioner Robert of French West Indies requesting the dispatch of a US plenipotentiary representative to Martinique. Hull stated that this matter was originally handled by the Navy Department, which manages the Caribbean, but since it involves diplomatic matters, the Navy Department will cooperate with the State Department. Hull also stated that he felt it was not yet necessary to consult with other American republics.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to responsible sources in Vichy, as reported by Haisong News Agency, although the formal transfer of the French island of Martinique to the United States has not yet become a reality, it will likely be implemented in the near future. The main reasons for Governor Robert of Martinique's negotiations with the United States are the terrible effects of the American famine blockade and the large number of infant deaths due to lack of milk. The Governor is still absolutely adhering to the instructions of Vichy. Although he has been forced by circumstances to succumb to the will of the anti-Axis powers, the French government's attitude towards this matter will not change.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Japanese Information Minister Hirota Discusses Establishing a Total War System <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office Spokesman Hirota, the Information Minister, stated at 3:00 PM yesterday at the regular press conference for the Chinese Newspaper Reporters Corps of this city that the characteristics of modern warfare require the establishment of a total war system, which is linked to politics, economics, and ideology. He elaborated in detail and finally hoped that the Chinese people would follow the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows as proclaimed by Chairman Wang, from theory to practice, and the meeting ended at 5:30 PM. The following is a summary of the main points:</p>
<p>Independence and Autonomy</p>
<p>Information Minister Hirota first spoke on the issue of the return of the Public Concession, stating that the agreement on the return of the Public Concession has been signed and will be implemented on August 1st. Therefore, the administrative institutions and administrative machinery of the Public Concession will be transferred to the Municipal Government in the future. The return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality are to expel British and American forces and complete China's independence and autonomy. However, the complete expulsion of British and American forces from China still depends on the complete victory of the Greater East Asia War, and then China can achieve complete independence and autonomy. In other words, we must still be determined to expel and destroy British and American forces before we stop. Furthermore, the purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to reduce British and American forces and seek the independence of East Asian nations. This issue is not only for Japan but also for the hundreds of millions of people of East Asia, that is, the hundreds of millions of people of East Asia should share the responsibility. To complete the Greater East Asia War, we should exert our strength according to our respective strengths and establish a total force system. Therefore, I would like to raise this current issue and ask everyone to understand the characteristics of modern warfare.</p>
<p>Concentrate Strength</p>
<p>The characteristic of modern warfare is not only military warfare but also the concentration of the political, economic, ideological, and other forces of the rear people into one, which is total war. Therefore, the comprehensive political, economic, and ideological war in the rear can determine the success or failure of military warfare. No matter how strong the army is, it is likely to be defeated without the backing of political, economic, and ideological total force. For example, France was unable to gain a victorious position due to internal political disunity and factional divisions, especially the struggle between Tugwell and Ji Lao, even though the army was strong. Another example is the economy of the United States. Although there are many coal mines, the great strike of 500,000 workers resulted in the failure to develop and the inability to produce and transport its tens of millions of tons of coal. How can it strengthen its combat power? Therefore, in order to achieve victory in the war, all resources in the rear must be organized to be effective. Furthermore, in the ideological war, how should we inspire national thinking, strengthen our beliefs, and work hard to ensure the final victory?</p>
<p>Firm Belief</p>
<p>The belief in the final victory of the Axis powers is becoming stronger and stronger, and the determination to develop a total war is increasing. The old concept of the anti-Axis powers is not true. They compare the territory and materials of the Axis powers with those of the anti-Axis powers, saying that the Axis powers have less territory and fewer materials, showing a decline in status. However, in reality, making comparisons in this way cannot determine success or failure based on the surface. We should change our view in this way: comparing the combined political, economic, and ideological forces of the Axis with those of the anti-Axis, the progress is much greater. Therefore, I have a firm determination in my belief in the victory of the Axis powers. In this Greater East Asia War of Independence and Liberation, the work of military warfare has been undertaken by the Japanese army. The National Government's regular army and the Japanese army in China have been cooperating in combat. In the south, the Thai army has also participated in the Myanmar campaign. Other peoples, such as the Malay Peninsula Indians, have also formed troops to participate in the southern campaign. Now let's discuss the political war of the Axis powers. Japan has implemented the return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality to China, and will also grant independence to Myanmar and the Philippines, and has given Java the right to participate in politics. Therefore, all the nations of Greater East Asia have realized the significance of the construction of the new order in East Asia. In terms of economy, the nations of Greater East Asia are standing on their own positions, first seeking self-sufficiency, and in terms of the production of military materials in all aspects, the general public has automatically provided manpower. The purpose of the ideological war, the significance of building a new order in East Asia, is becoming increasingly clear, and the war will of the general public is becoming more and more aroused and strengthened. As a result, the combined strength of the hundreds of millions of people of all East Asia is higher, and the date of the final victory is approaching faster. Therefore, from the perspective of the total war, a total war system should be established in all aspects of the war to exert the great effect of the total war.</p>
<p>Strive to Practice</p>
<p>Finally, let me briefly describe the responsibilities that China bears in the Greater East Asia War. In terms of force, the regular army of the National Government and the Japanese army are cooperating in combat. In the naval aspect, the new navy has been carrying out maritime defense. Therefore, the main burden at present should be the economy. We can say that China's economy should be reorganized into a complete wartime system. The stronger the organization, the more secure the final victory will be, and the faster it will come. Therefore, it is necessary to reorganize the wartime system to perfection to determine the final victory and determine the independence and liberation of the East Asian nations. Finally, I sincerely hope that the Chinese people will follow the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows as proclaimed by Chairman Wang, from theory to full practice.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Japanese Embassy Holds Consular Conference to Adjust Distribution Agencies in Central China <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The importance of promoting the exchange of goods in Central China is becoming increasingly apparent. To promote the exchange of goods, the first thing to do is to adjust the transaction and distribution agencies in Central China. It is learned that the Japanese Embassy Consular Conference has decided to hold a meeting at the Japanese Embassy Office in Shanghai on the 2nd and 3rd, focusing on the reorganization of the transaction agencies. In addition to the Director of the General Affairs Section of the China Affairs Bureau of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Xie Da Zuo, and the Director of the Investigation Section of the General Affairs Bureau, Shiomi, attending the meeting, the embassy's Minister Tajiri and the General Manager of the General Affairs Department, Okazaki, attended the meeting, as well as the relevant section chiefs. The Consul General of the Shanghai Consulate General, Yano, the Consul General of Nanjing, Tanaka, and the Consul General of Hankou, Takanzu, as well as more than 50 deputy consuls from Bengbu, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuhu, Xuzhou, Haizhou, Jiujiang, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Haikou, and other places, attended the meeting. All parties have high expectations for this meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Talk on the Return of the Public Concession <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Jie</p>
<p>Regarding the friendly nation of Japan's implementation of the return of the Shanghai Public Concession, the signing ceremony was completed on the 30th of last month under the auspices of relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities. Our country formally recovers the upper part of the Public Concession, which will be fully realized by the first of next month. During these nearly hundred years, England and America used the Shanghai Public Concession as a base to jointly implement aggression against the entire China. It was truly like first causing the heart of China to become corrupt. Therefore, in these hundred years, China has felt unable to recover its physical and mental strength no matter what, the poison was truly extremely severe.</p>
<p>When the Father of the Nation was dying, he announced to us that unequal treaties must be abolished, and their realization must be expedited in the shortest period. Now the friendly nation of Japan is earnestly practicing this, assisting our country in completing the promise of independence and autonomy. On January 9th of this year, it signed an agreement with our country regarding the return of the concession and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. By March 30th, it implemented the full return of the exclusively administered concessions of Japan in China. Recently, it further implemented the provisions of Article 4 of the agreement, and thus our country's recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession finally became a reality. The base from which England and America had aggressed against China for a hundred years has been completely eradicated.</p>
<p>Now, as we face this epoch-making event, I feel that, from the perspective of the responsibility of the citizens of Shanghai, we should at least do the following two things: First, from now on, every citizen of Shanghai should contribute their physical strength, mental strength, or material resources to assist the government in completing the mission of participating in the war. Second, from now on, every citizen of Shanghai should assist the government authorities in promoting its established plans regarding public security, culture, and construction, so as to achieve a state of perfection.</p>
<p>As for the issue of the return of the Shanghai French Concession, in order to make the administrative sovereignty of Shanghai complete, we also hope that the French authorities can automatically return it to our country on August 1st. In this way, the friendship between China and France will surely be further enhanced. We believe in the wisdom of the French authorities, and they will certainly be able to see this point. I sincerely hope that the French authorities will put it into practice.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Public Concession to be Recovered Soon, Documents to be Changed to Chinese, Prosecutor's Office Expanded to Prosecutor's Agency, Number of Prosecutors to be Increased <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The various documents used by the police stations under the Public Concession's Bureau of Works have always been in English. Recently, some documents have been changed to Japanese. However, the agreement for our country to recover the Public Concession was signed at the end of last month, and it will be implemented on August 1st. From then on, all administrative and police affairs must be taken over by our country. Therefore, all documents must be reformed. In order to allow all subordinates to practice, the police authorities will gradually change the investigation reports of cases handled by various police stations to Chinese. The Jing'an Temple Police Station, Gordon Road Police Station, etc., have already changed a part of the reports to Chinese from the 1st of this month. The other police stations will also fully change to Chinese reports within days. Also, because the Public Concession will be recovered on August 1st, the cases prosecuted by the various police stations according to the agreement will be transferred to the Jiangsu High Court Second Branch and the First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office to undertake the power of investigation and prosecution. According to the order of the Ministry of Justice, the Prosecutor's Office will be expanded to a Prosecutor's Agency, but it is found that both courts have already reorganized the Prosecutor's Office into a Prosecutor's Agency on the 1st of this month. However, each of the two courts currently has only one Chief Prosecutor and one Prosecutor. In the future, as affairs increase, it will be difficult to manage. Therefore, it is expected that the number of prosecutors in the two agencies will be appropriately increased.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Works Information Office announced: Recently, there have been rumors in the market that the Bureau's plan for distributing grain according to the number of people will be suspended. This is completely unfounded. Due to unavoidable delays in the arrival of rice in Shanghai, the issuance of rice with the 40th coupon has had to be temporarily postponed for a few days. The Bureau has now issued Announcement No. 6409, stating that starting from Monday, July 5th, citizens may exchange the 40th coupon for one liter of rice (the price remains at four yuan and five jiao). As for the validity period of the coupon, it has been changed to fifteen days, but the Bureau will cooperate with relevant authorities to try its best to find ways to supplement the insufficient amount within this month.</p>

Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue represented Mayor Chen to perform the opening kick. Halfway through the game, the match ball was auctioned off, and Cheng Pa'an, representing Yiyuan owner Pu Weiai, purchased it for the high price of 20,000 yuan.

Li Tiansheng's individual technique was outstanding, Li Yao was also considerable, and Meng Yiliang was not weak either. The referee was Deng Xiaoliang. In the first half, Lianyi's Sun Jinshun scored first, then Lianyi's Qu Yongfu accidentally kicked the ball into his own goal, resulting in an own goal, which Donghua gained without effort.

<p>Regarding the China-Japan Trade Federation, a subordinate organization of the China Trade Joint Venture, which is responsible for controlling the trade of Japanese merchants in Central China, the second promoters' meeting decided on the articles of association on June 29th, and held the inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM on the 1st at the Japanese Club. From the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office, Minister Tajiri, Director Okazaki, Planning Section Chief Tsuneoka of the Economic Department, Commercial and Industrial Section Chief Tokunaga, and Officer Ye attended, as well as Consul General Yano and West Hara, Director of Management of the General Military Affairs. Fujino, branch manager of Mitsubishi Corporation, served as chairman of the meeting. After reporting on the progress of the preparations, resolutions were passed on the food regulations and budget proposals. Minister Tajiri then delivered a speech and the meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM. It was decided that the president of the federation will be appointed by the supervisory authorities, and the Japanese Embassy is currently evaluating candidates. For the time being, Okazaki, Director of General Affairs of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office, will act as the proxy. The standing directors and supervisors will be appointed by the president after the president is appointed. It is heard that the annual business expenses of the federation have been determined to be within 10 million yuan, which will be covered by the handling fees charged by the association and miscellaneous income.</p>
<p>Speech by Minister Tajiri</p>
<p>To promote China's economic development, it is necessary to reorganize the domestic economic system and restructure the external economic institutions. The domestic system was established on March 15th with the establishment of the National Commercial Control Council. The external economic institutions have completed their new system with the establishment of the China-Japan Trade Federation. It is truly gratifying. The external transaction organizations in Central China should be organized with the common goals of China and Japan. However, the Chinese institutions are still in the process of preparation. It is seen that after the establishment of the two new groups, they will jointly organize the China Trade Joint Venture, so as to strive for China's development, and I hope that all commercial groups will be consistent and take the overall situation into consideration, and take the responsibility of cultivating good combat power first. Furthermore, with the establishment of this federation, the various trade associations in the past will be dissolved immediately. However, I express my deep gratitude for the contributions made by these organizations to the military and the development of the economy of Central China since their establishment. At the same time, I hope that this association will double its enthusiasm and work hand in hand with the National Commercial Control Council to contribute to the development of the new China.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Pan Da, Director of the West Shanghai Police Station, Broadcast to the Nation Yesterday, Reporting on the Overview of West Shanghai Police Administration <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Pan Da, Director of the West Shanghai Police Station, has been credited with meritorious service for the police administration of West Shanghai since he took office. At 4:00 PM yesterday, Director Pan specially broadcast on Shanghai Radio, reporting to the nation on the current important administrative policies in the West Shanghai district, the process of the Municipal Government taking over the four police rights of Shanghai, and the overview of the four police administrations of Shanghai. The original text of the speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Overview of Police Administration</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, I am Pan Da, the Director of the West Shanghai Police Station of Shanghai Special City. Today, I want to report to you on the overview of the police administration in the West Shanghai district of Shanghai. The first thing I want to say is that the police rights of West Shanghai have now been taken back by the Chinese government. When Shanghai opened concessions, West Shanghai originally belonged to the jurisdiction of Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the concessions expanded repeatedly, and the roads built beyond the boundaries reached as many as twenty-eight, resulting in inconsistent police rights and unstable public security.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Municipal Government was established and began negotiations for the recovery. Later, the former mayor held a resolute determination, and after many twists and turns, and with the mediation of the friendly nation of Japan, a temporary police agreement was established on February 16th of the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>After Mayor Chen took office, he continued to negotiate. The police rights of West Shanghai were finally resolved reasonably. On February 1st of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, an "Organizational Rules for Special Police in the Fourth District of Shanghai" was signed with the Bureau of Works of the Public Concession, referred to as the "Special Police Agreement for the Fourth District of Shanghai." According to this agreement, the West Shanghai Special Police Headquarters was established on March 15th of the same year, and I served as the director of the headquarters, in charge of the police affairs of the entire West Shanghai district. However, the Special Police Headquarters had 179 personnel recommended by the Bureau of Works.</p>
<p>The Process of Recovery</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and American forces in Shanghai were eliminated. On May 1st of the thirty-first year of the Republic of China, the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Works agreed to abolish the agreement. The police rights of the roads built beyond the boundaries of West Shanghai were completely taken back and managed by the Municipal Government. The West Shanghai Special Police Headquarters was reorganized into "Shanghai Special City West Shanghai Police Station" on May 11th, and I continued to serve as the director. This period of facts is the process of the recovery of the police rights of West Shanghai, which is worth recording in Chinese history.</p>
<p>Now, I want to talk about the police administration facilities in West Shanghai. As I mentioned above, West Shanghai could not have peace because the police rights were not unified, the opium dens were lined up, the gambling houses were all over the place, and the bandits were rampant. West Shanghai was called the "Land of Evil." After the establishment of the Special Police Headquarters, the opium dens and gambling houses were completely banned in a short period of two months, and the bandits did not dare to act recklessly. From then on, public security was established and it became the "Land of Happiness." This is what we are worth reporting to you. Other important administrative policies include clearing the population, managing the rice leveling, controlling materials, and organizing Baojia, all of which have achieved great success.</p>
<p>Regarding the police themselves, everyone can serve loyally, abide by orders, be honest and upright, endure hardship and hard work, and care for the good. From now on, we will work even harder and hope to have better results to report to you.</p>

<p>— Luo Chen</p>
<p>A friend who claimed to be an optimist wrote the following passage in my commemorative album—</p>
<p>"What is so strange about being a sun with brilliant light? Seen through colored lenses, it is just a dark wheel. Besides, you are not the sun! It is better to be like Zheng Banqiao said: It is rare to be muddled."</p>
<p>This is his view of life, his way of dealing with the world.</p>
<p>It is said that this makes him happy, because all the distressing things no longer bother him. It is like a drunk person, the world in front of him is just blurred and unclear, then "distress" is just a few blurred images to him, so there is no such thing as "distress."</p>
<p>However, I see that he really does not understand what true happiness is.</p>
<p>Has anyone really been drunk? Then he will definitely know the feeling when he first wakes up—emptiness, discomfort. Regretting: "Why did I get drunk again, letting the precious youth be wasted in the haze!"</p>
<p>Drunkenness never lasts a lifetime. You can't make yourself live forever in muddle, because many "realistic" things don't let you be muddled. You are hungry, you really don't have food to eat, can you say: "Be muddled, I am not hungry?" You are cold, you really don't have money to buy clothes, can you say: "Be muddled, I am not cold"?—? If so, you can only starve to death and freeze to death!</p>
<p>Finding happiness in muddle is the way of dealing with the world for the rich—and the rich who have been defeated on the battlefield of life.</p>
<p>I want to say this—</p>
<p>"What is there to be inferior about if you are just a small star? Although small, it also helps passers-by recognize directions in the dark night.</p>
<p>"Perhaps, you are not even a star—just a small candlelight! In places without electric lights, aren't people also working under candlelight?</p>
<p>What is most feared is—you only want to be the sun, or something even better than the sun—that is often impossible, so you are discouraged, depressed, and want to use "muddle" to anesthetize yourself. As a result, you can't even be a candlelight."</p>
<h3 id="e58">Enjoying Blessings Versus Enduring Hardship <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Dongpu</p>
<p>The elderly want to enjoy blessings, and the young also want to enjoy blessings; everyone's desires are aligned with enjoying blessings. Seeing others enjoy blessings, they envy them greatly, and if they cannot enjoy blessings, they lament their fate as being bitter and lacking in blessings.</p>
<p>Everyone only hopes to become "people above people," unwilling to endure "bitterness among bitterness."</p>
<p>Those who possess inherited ancestral estates and who amass wealth through hoarding goods enjoy privileged lives. They have no need to endure hardship, nor do they even conceive of hardship as something to be endured. These are the "people above people" who know how to enjoy blessings, but they are also parasites of society and the nation. If everyone were to simply sit back and enjoy happiness, then what progress would society and the nation make?</p>
<h3 id="e59">Chicken <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>Xiubao woke up in a fright in her dream, not knowing what was going on. She trembled in bed, afraid to make a sound. Akun's wife... After Akun was led away, she started to sob quietly. Xiubao rubbed her sleepy eyes, put on her clothes, got out of bed, and ran to her mother's side, crying along with her, while intermittently learning from her mother's mouth that it was those cruel people who had just come to catch the chicken who had taken him away. In the dim light, the mother and daughter wept sadly together. After a while, Akun's wife said:</p>
<p>"Xiubao, you go to sleep first... I want to wait for your father to come back!" Xiubao shook her head, refusing, and said:</p>
<p>"Mom, where did Dad go? Would it be okay if I go with Mom to look for him?"</p>
<p>"I don't know either! Where can we go to look?" Akun's wife sobbed even more.</p>
<p>About an hour later, the town's Li Zhenzhang, along with the head of the local neighborhood, Lu Jiazhang, hurriedly ran to Akun's house. Stepping through the door, Li Zhenzhang said, "Sister-in-law Akun, how did you manage to cause such a disaster? In these times, those who carry guns are not to be trifled with. We were all at home preparing to rest peacefully when suddenly, the headquarters sent someone to summon us, saying that Akun was suspected of colluding with bandits and that there were firearms hidden in his home, and that we were responsible for investigating and finding them. How is this matter to be resolved?" Everyone was silent for a long time.</p>
<p>"When we came out of the headquarters, we saw Akun crying with a mournful face, his hands tied behind his back to a pillar in the corner of the house. He has probably already suffered. As we walked out the door, a orderly followed us out and told us to come up with a good solution. I think it would be best to grit your teeth and scrape together some money to reward them, so that Akun doesn't suffer inside. Sister-in-law Akun, what do you think?" Li Zhenzhang said slowly.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your concern. I am ignorant. As long as Akun can come back, I will listen to whatever you ask me to do!" Akun's wife pleaded with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Sigh! I've suffered enough just holding this position as town head. Isn't this incident the same as what happened to Zhang Jiaobo of Shangchun? In short, Akun is in big trouble, and we are in small trouble. What else can we say? Otherwise, they'll beat him until his skin is torn and his flesh is rotten, and in the end, we'll still have to bribe them to settle the matter. In my experience, it's best to settle this tonight. If it spreads tomorrow, it will be difficult to handle," Li Zhenzhang said, offering his opinion based on his experience.</p>
<p>"How much money do you have at home? Let's all chip in and go quickly. Sister-in-law Akun, hurry up and think of a way to get some money!" Lu Jiazhang urged Akun's wife to think of a way to get money.</p>
<p>"I... I... I don't have any money at home. Akun was sick for three months and just recovered, and we already owe a lot of debt. I really can't think of anything," Akun's wife sobbed.</p>
<p>"That won't do. Empty talk is useless. I'll think of a way for you. Perhaps you can talk to Uncle Huang of Hedong and borrow some money, but you'll need collateral. We two can vouch for you. Do you have any good clothes or silverware that you can use as collateral?" Li Zhenzhang said, looking at Akun's wife's pitiful appearance, and feeling extremely distressed.</p>
<p>"The clothes have already been pawned off. The only thing left is the set of silver ornaments that Xiubao will wear at her wedding, and those people in gray cloth just took that away. There's really nothing I can do. You should give me an idea!" Akun's wife said. (3)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Responding to Educational Aid: Feng Xietang Continues with Charity Sale <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Feng Shuangtang Stationery Shop sent a letter yesterday, stating: "Your newspaper's call for student loans demonstrates your concern for students who have lost the opportunity to study. People share the same sentiment, whether by donating funds or holding charity sales. All of Shanghai is responding eagerly and competing to be the first. Our shop, which deals in stationery, writing brushes, ink, and painting materials, as well as writing paper and fans, feels it is our duty to contribute. Therefore, we have decided to hold a five-day charity sale starting on July 6th at our shop on the opposite side of the Bank of China in Baxianqiao. We will donate 10% of the total sales revenue, without deducting expenses, to your newspaper's student loan fund. This will allow patrons to purchase useful items at low prices and also help students who have lost the opportunity to study, benefiting the community. This will achieve two goals with one action. At the same time, we plan to donate to the News' student loan fund, the North China disaster relief fund, the Chao-Shan disaster relief fund, and the Yangzheng Primary School student aid fund, all through the same method of donating a percentage of sales, with each charity sale lasting five days. Our shop's address is 144 Maxiao Baolu Road."</p>
<h3 id="e61">Feng Wenfeng's Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting is a Great Success <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>From the day before yesterday until the 5th, Ms. Feng Wenfeng held a charity exhibition of calligraphy and painting at the Ningbo Association Hall on Chu Qiaqing Road. Although the weather has not been clear for days, there are still many visitors. German expatriates and friendly people from other countries have all come to visit, ordering pieces to take back with them. They share an appreciation for the art and praise it together. In total, more than half of the pieces have been ordered in the past two days. We still hope that people from all walks of life will remember the public good and charity, and quickly go to select and purchase, so that the Nan Shi Xinpu Qingtang area of this city can receive more assistance in terms of benevolent grain and charitable rice soup.</p>

<p>It is known that the Chen Zhi Summer Tutoring School is divided into thirteen subjects including Chinese, English, Japanese, German, and Mathematics. Classes will begin on July 5th. The school address is Yisheng Primary School in Deqing Lane, Muer Ming Road. In order to provide preferential treatment to underprivileged students, five free places and ten half-price places are specially set up for each subject.</p>
<p>The Traffic Experiment Summer School at 970 Aiwenyi Road admits both junior and senior high school students and also has free places available. A simple application form can be obtained from the school.</p>
<p>The private Saint John's Middle School at 13 Fanwangdu Youth Association Lane received a donation from a kind philanthropist in memory of his late father, providing twenty half-price places for junior high school students. The exam will be held at 8:00 AM on July 24th. All excellent underprivileged students can apply for the exam and register in advance.</p>
<p>If there are students in various grades of senior and junior high school who are of good character and academics and have a desire to pursue further education but whose families are poor and unable to afford to continue their studies, they can submit their family circumstances, along with school certificates and a photograph, to No. 4, Lane 29, Gaonaiyi Road, French Concession, by July 10th, to be forwarded to the Sanle Hall Master.
