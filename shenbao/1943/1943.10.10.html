<h3>國民應加倍努力　…世二年國慶日陳市長廣播詞…</h3>
<p>諸位先生：</p>
<p>今天時中華民國三十二年的雙十國慶紀念，中華民國　辛亥革命誫生至今已是壯年了，中間經過許多　患困難，卒至今日，能夠自由獨立，這是我們所足引為慶祝的。然而今後我們的貴在是中重了，事業也是擴展了，我還想引國父一句話：「革命尚未成功，同志仍須努力。」</p>
<p>今天的國慶都和往年不同，是歷史空前的大事，凡是我們國民應須澈底了解，更須以後加倍努力的。</p>
<p>此次參戰的意義</p>
<p>第一作大事是中華民國的參戰，諸位　記得第一次歐戰，中國也是參加過的，然而這次參加大東亞戰爭和以前的參戰不同。第一次的參加歐軗，祇是列强的戰爭，換一句話說，僅是這隨英美之後，為他們爭奪利益的戰爭。當時雖在世界中謚威爾遁的宣傳，和其他紙面好聽的文章，說那次大戰是公理和正義之戰，戰後民族可以自決。可是歐戰完畢之日，中國還不能自決，世界弱小民族還不能自決，所有殖民地……甚至英國所會尤許自治的印度也還不能自決。反一方面帝國主義對於東亞的束縛，日　加强，對於東亞的國附斜紛，日加挑撥。所以從前的參戰，中國對於國際無異於幫兇，對於自己，無異於自縛。這次中國參加大東亞戰爭的意義和事實，和第一次的參戰，截然不同，我們不但自身求得解放，並且也替東亞全民族求得解放。現在中國已經獨立自由了，束亞各殖民地，緬旬和菲律賓也是獨立自由了，連馬來和爪咔的人民也獲得參政權了，這種理想，非常偉大，這種憲　，非常　要。深合　國父的大亞洲主義，也正是我們依據國父遺囑，聯合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奮鬥，努力邁　了。</p>
<p>廢除不平等條約</p>
<p>第二件大事是日本和其他國家，對中　民國撤消治外法權和交囘租界。　位先生，我們要知道　父詔示我閃的廢除不平等條約的意義嗎？中國的不能獨立和自由，中國不能成為的代國家，完全愛不平等條約的束縛。現在治外法權撤消了，租界交囘了，中國自革命以來全國薪求解放的目的已達到了。本年日本東條首相對於議會，更鄭重聲明修正廿九年冬所訂的中日基本條約，這種　明，實行即在目前，從此中國在世界上，即為一個完全獨立自由的國家，在國際上即為一個完全平等的國家。我們全國人民，經過無數兩苦艱難，得到今日的解放，可以告慰於我們的祖先。可以告慰於國父四十年致力革命的遺志，可以告慰於辛亥以　姚立共和的諸先烈了。</p>
<p>然而我剛才為什麼還引國父「革命尚未成功同志仍須努力」的遺訓來　勉各位呢？就因為大東亞戰爭溫正在開，全面和平退沒有實現，因此我們須加倍努力。</p>
<p>力大東亞戰爭</p>
<p>關於大東亞戰爭的展開，我閃應該自已的檢討，我們到底協力到什麼程度。我們也知道，這次大東亞戰爭，我閃有不少物資的貢獻，同時南洋的華僑對於日本　復和建設南洋有不和的協助，可是我們絕不引起為滿足，而且更願意作時一步的協力，汪主席曾詔示我們，我們應該和日本同生共死，因此我們應該不以在後方與日本人民同甘共苦為已足，而應該在前綫與日本士兵同生共死　快慰。我們要知道次大東亞戰爭，不是東亞某一個國家存亡的關係，而是大東亞全民族存亡的關係。中國不但為自息求解放，也是　東亞各民族求解放，　此我們必須在後方的，確立治安，增加生產，更應該組織民衆，訓練士兵，總希望有日我們拿出中華民族赴義求仁的精神，　行在疆塲求全亞洲民族的解放，而與帝國主者戰鬥。</p>
<p>薪求民族解放</p>
<p>說却此地，我深願對重慶方面說幾句話了。國民政府都還的目的，在於薪求全面和平，更薪求與日本協力，保衛東亞，和解放東亞。或者富時我們的理想，為各人的情感所敝，不能明瞭。然而國府還部三年半了，我們和平的眞意，參戰的目的，治外法權撤消和租界的收囘成功，基本條約修正的討論，各種事實以次實現在我閃目彰，諸位總了解丫解丫罷。中國由不自由獨立而至自由　立，中國由不解放而至解放，各位也應知通這些事實了。大東亞戰爭的意義，是基於東方道義的精神，以實現各民族的解放，我們更應該基於東方道義的　　來　想日本，來參加大東亞戰爭。現在中日事變已成過去歷史的名詞，我很希望全國人民本於國父遺　和中華民族智仁勇的精神，統一中國，統一和平，全國加入這次對帝國主義者解放東亞之戰，來完成歷史上偉大的事業。</p>
<p>望愛的國民，今日眞是千載一時之機，是我們復興中華良機，是我們保衛東亞的良機。自雅片戰爭以來，我們以勢弱力細之故，時常　人。在清末以至民國初元，靠國際均勢以自存，自第一次歐戰以後，更靠國際聯盟……　言之，靠英美的平行行分動以自存。今後我們是一個完全獨立自由的國家，應該提起精神，淬屬心力，來　發　存，自求解放，兼求全亞洲的解放罷，開了敬祝中華民國萬歲！萬萬歲！</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>增加農工生產</h3>
<p>今年國慶紀念日，本報特刋徵文，特側重於「如何增加農工生產？」以此一間　，實為復興國家的主要關　，而國民政府所公佈之戰時經濟政策繼領，亦以增加生產為其中心　象，因此，如何增加農工生產，乃為今日最迫切，最重要，最値得研究討論的問題。</p>
<p>我們認為社會人士，特別是經濟界領袖，對於　個問題所　　獻的意見，實與整個的中國經濟的途有着切　的　係。以我們站在與的界立場而言，深覺在如何增加農工生產的一　響亮的呼聲下，國家獎勵問題，應予特別提出。</p>
<p>為加緊　工生產之步驟，促進農工生產在質與最雙方面的進步，我們感覺國家獎勵辦法，必須包括以下幾個要點：　在適當的物價政策之下，保　農工生產者之收益，以獎勵其再生產，　對於農產品之購買，特別法憲鼓勵農民之再生產，　對於工人生活之保障，特別注得於　　福利事業之推時，　實行「以其所有，易其所無」這辦法，促進農產品與日用工業品之交換，　扶　民間正當企　團體，其所建立之工廠，確屬有關民生日用必需者，予以獎掖　勵，應優先配給者，予以優先，應優　待過者，予以優價。</p>
<p>凡此穩拙，均須包括在政府獎勵農工增匪的　個計劃中，使全國人力物力，全部集中於農工生產各部門，共同效力於戰時安定民生之大道，豈不懿　盛哉？</p>
<h3>布廠新商請求救濟　中儲允予貨款　正與中國染織銀行洽商辦法</h3>
<p>本市布廠業同業公會以自收買紗布之後，各布廠資金枯竭，職工生計無着，會函棉製品聯會　轉請問統會轉商中央儲備銀行，撥借國幣二千萬元，由中國染織業銀行分別轉放各會員工廠，一俟紗布給價卽行清償商統會當卽轉函中儲查核辦理，頃悉，中儲　於布廠業同業公會所請撥借國幣二千萬元以資救濟一事破衷同情，並已函復商統會，　中略稱：「查該工會所請借貸一飾，如該人同業組織之中國染織業銀行，能提供相當擔保品，可逕與本行上海分行商治貸放辦法，除函知漉行洽議隨時擬具辦法，旦候核奪外，請查照轉知」等語，商統會接函後業已轉函知照。</p>
<h3>證交復業後　徵稅辦法</h3>
<p>銀　兩業公會通告會員行荘云，逕啓者，頃奉財部錢二字一八八號訓含開：「　查上海華商證券交易所業經本部會同實業部令飭復業，其徵收證券交易稅所依據之交易所交易接吻條例有關條文，亦經本部會同實業部　　修正案呈奉國民政府公佈施行，除分行外，合　檢發上項修正條文令，仰該公會知照並轉各會員銀行一體知照此令」等因，並附到交易稅修正條文一件，率此相應分別轉達，並抄發該修正條文一份　希查照是荷，附交易所交易稅條例第二條甲枚修正條文，卅二年九月卅日國府公佈有價證關公佈有價證券，按價格徵收之，其價格內百元以下之　目　按百元　算，現貨徵買賣價格萬分之六，期貨徵約定價格萬分之四，政府發行之公債庫券交易按稅率四分之一　算。</p>
<h3>今明兩日　銀錢業休假　十二日起復業</h3>
<p>本市銀錢業各行荘，　照銀錢兩業同業公會規定十月十日國慶紀念休假一天，因是日適値星期日例假，特於十一日（星期一）補假一天，准十二日起復业，關於休假期內一切票據收解，俟復業時再行辦理，並聞各業市場　照銀錢業休假辦法，十日及十一日一律停市。</p>
<h3>實部核准　毛皮列入主要品</h3>
<p>最近皮革業同業聯合會及華中日本人皮革業聯合會，請將毛皮一項列入主要商品，毛皮同業公會應一律參中聯合會，函請商統會察核，當經商統會據情　函實業部核復，嗣經實業部函請物資統制番　會　議，茲經記乾探悉，物資統制審議會第五次常會時，對於此案業已決關，准将毛皮應列入主要商品之內，函復實業部　理，刻商統會方面亦已接到實部復函，並已分別轉右皮革業同業聯合會及華中日本人皮革業聯合會查照辦理矣。</p>
<h3>石炭聯合會將　管理煤商</h3>
<p>本市石炭聯合會，鑒於　業煤斤資買，時有非法國事。因之對謚市面供求情况。常　失调，影響民生　鉅，故對於管理煤　零出商之機構，決予强化，愛經決定凡煤　零售問　論老店或　　，槪須</p>
<p>加入公會</p>
<p>設於蘇州河以南者須加入上海特別市煤業零售商聯合會為會長，開設於蘇州河以北者，應加入石炭十分艱巨售組合為會員，所以有如此副分　，全為求管　上之便利。石炭聯合會　通知各零售商今後任何貿　，槪須</p>
<p>恪守業規</p>
<p>本會員之販賣區域，以　照興亞送準中連絡部對大中聯煤號所核准之區域為限。　本會會員如遇煤斤欠缺時，得向會接洽作適當之處置。　本會會員須將價格表　掛於店肆之門前注目處，　本會會員之售價須絕對遵守當核准之限價，不得超過或减低。　绝對不准藏貨拒售，或　　　市交易。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨　股責同業因今日為雙十節，下週一例須補假，有兩天之休市，為便利交割計，故多數昨先停市一天，惟仍有少數同業常開做，交易既艱普通，求供頭寸迄求易平衡，買戶　　，漲風易懈，今誌分理動態於後：</p>
<p>紡織　永安紡織始終為買風籠罩，步升不已，仍雖進得；榮　增資送三新股證　，復見　升，美亞綢廠出關，中紡亦見　　，　和上升最戶；餘如編　及火中華織造等股亦稍進展；景　衫　老殷與除權均有做開；市與景綸均平。</p>
<p>百貨　永安關外買戶頗多，新新一慚貨各見做　，內家亦挺。</p>
<p>新藥　新亞藥廠購抬又起，與中法藥房及新星藥廠均見做萬。</p>
<p>文化　中華貴局突升，商務與世界亦　，永祥略挺。</p>

<p>地產　買鳳亦動，聯　與新益於午刻提上，永與　平。</p>
<p>金融　大　·上海·新興等行有單戶，　者絕跡。</p>
<p>實業　華成與兩　烟公訂喊價均平，大中　火柴復商，久安實業在增資消息中踏上，　華實業際　，大中　實業亦挺，新亞建業做升，中國興國　　資價亦戚高，康元　　　見提上。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>日用品　本外埠銷路充足，正當用戶視用量配　，以致肥皂小　價跌進　價，火柴價格亦見呆定，至於捲烟頣中各牌繼續堅挺，其他各廠出品亦　　倒，價格續升頗勁。</p>
<p>米糧　各路到貨寡　，吝星去路反　活躍，市　堅定，惟雜糧交易不旺，黃豆　　　　低落少許。</p>
<p>茶　　本街店戶，納憲淡溥，執貨者鑒於市上存底不雙，無意求售。價　無　恎，全市祇由午昌茶業公司及志豊茶荘共去錄茶廿組左右，係公易　　兩茶行所售出。</p>
<p>人造絲　市况仍堅挺，　因一般執貨者，鑒於銷動，一致扳俏，信乃　在喊高中。</p>
<h3>監理局取締　非法保險公司</h3>
<p>實業部保險監理局，鑒於保險　業攸關社會經濟至大，凡經營保險業之機關，須向該局申請登記領照，而保險業委任代理人，亦定有資格限制，該局近查京淍各地，時有良稱保險公司者或代理保險事業，此種機關，未向該局領照，實屬不法。該局現將對於此種非法事業，除勒令停辦外，且將加以相當處罰，嗣後經濟保險事業者，槪須登領照，並須遵照保險業法　理。</p>
<h3>火柴有皂存貨　登記</h3>
<p>第一區化署對火柴肥皂之計口配給方案業經決定，於一八兩區先行試　，並　規定　理肥皂洋火存貨登記。其辦法為凡在本年十月九晶營業終了時所存火柴超過一箱（一·二〇〇　每盒祗小九十枝），肥皂超過一箱者，貯藏或所有人或與所存火柴有經濟或管理上之關係者所有之火柴枵肥皂均須向該署登記，登記　　自本年十月十二日起向江西路二〇九號該署第六二四號辦公塞索取。塡就後至　應於本月十八日送　該　，在別種辦法未公佈前，火柴或肥皂之貯藏地點及（或）所有人以及存貨積景倘有變更，變須向該辦公室登記，倘有違犯上述規則，當將所存火柴或肥皂沒收，并予相當處分。又悉火柴肥皂之市區及內地一帶配給問題，茲據有關方面探悉，恐　不在同時實施，尚須稍緩。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>交易機構的調整</h3>
<p>華中為物資交流機構的一環，現有漸次整備的趨琴，　們看到最近關係當局的會議頻繁，足為促進交易機　的象徵，實可　幸。</p>
<p>大東亞共榮國的物資交流，無疑的，華中是重要的一部，華北華中的經濟關係，更為密性均甚　著，所以華北華中間的物資交流，呆說是中國方面貿易活動範圍的基礎，檢閱全國商業紡制總會暫行條例，其中有一條規定，商統會機　仛處理國內各地域物資交流的運營事項，則以上任務，有隨商統會之推分理處而發展的傾向，介後如保使之强化，實有深切的期望。</p>
<p>華中與日本之間的物資交流，亦為一　要問題，向來的日本交易營團，為中華貿易聯營會會是在今年七月一日成立，其基本構成分子，為　　配聯及　軍配組組合，改組以後，進展甚連，此新機構之任務如何，軍配總務委員會西凉總務部長曾說：「隨實現今國民政府政治體制劃期的進　，中華日本貿易聯合會有新的　展，在此重大的時局下，有資極重要的意義，因為　此呆以倱進日華一體合作，完逐聖　。當然，要求貿聯的順調　　，不論人的環物的要縫隙，均須整飭，和衷共濟的合作，才可　成預期的目的。</p>
<p>在此我們竭誠希望商統會的貿聯補　機構，相互協調，圓滑運　，使華中的物資交流，更見活　，一切　貨，物價，生產　事項，均隨之改進，在今日的情况之下，不能再有所延避了。此各互相促進濟的運營，對於現地決戰體制，關係太重大，實不　忽視，（節譯十月八晶大陸新報）</p>

<p>吾國畫學至今而衰弊極矣，豈止衰弊，且將　滅！至郡邑無聞畫人者，二三名宿摹寫豈王二南之糟粕，枯筆工筆，類皆味同嚼　，高天厚地，奈何身作畫囚而猶以自炫，或臨摹傳寫，取其粗而遺共精，梅蘭竹菊，伸紙漫塗，或　條數筆，韵法兩虧，即號日名家，豈不寃哉。即能篤實研攻者，亦往往迷於派別之說，限於門戶之見，以致風趨益下，習俗愈卑，無山自拔。有　聞者，深譏浙派，祖婁東者，輒詆吳門，臨穎茫然，與麥難洞。嗚呼！畫理之精微，藝學之博大，豈區區一家一派之所能囿耶？門戶派別之見愈深，其束縛愈難自解，以故近來畫家之藝術心境日益淺狹，汲而易竭，覽之無餘，共支離滅裂者，尤堪浩歎。宗風不　，能不慨然！</p>

<h3>今後申報努力的工作　——紀念本報六十週年——</h3>
<p>今年為本報六十週年紀念年。為本「老當益壯」與「自强不息」之旨，謀本報之進步，曾擬定新的工作方針，于去年九月一日本報六十週年紀念宣言中鄭重宣示于國人之前。</p>
<p>在此宣言中曾有說：「在今後繼續展開之新史頁中，本報應如何以肩荷此社會先騵與推進時代之重責？如何使社會進入合理之常軌？如何使我民族臻於興盛與繁榮？是則本報同人在六十年後之今日所鄭重深言體念，而不敢絲毫放鬆者」。又說「以積極之行動，努力于本報之改進，勞力於應負責任之實踐，不推諉，不畏縮，盡我棉薄，期有以自效」。同時幷揭舉介紹科學新知，指示世界經濟轉捩情勢，探究社會問題，代表公正輿論，引導并扶掖靑年，研究邊彊問題，鼓吹移民殖邊，陳述國際政治之情勢等項，為今後努力之鵠的。</p>
<p>然而，不幸，在此一宣言發表後第十七天，震撼世界的九一八東北禍變即突然爆發，隨後，一二八上海之戰又接踵而作。大難臨頭，舉國憂憤惶恐，都集中力量於抗禦當前的大敵。因此，上述的努力計劃，亦隨之而暫時擱置，至今還不曾開始進行。</p>
<p>從去年到今年，舉國紛紛擾擾，不可終朝，而國難依然是「原封未動」。本報同人從而覺悟到欲謀　破國難，不在於空口的呌囂，亦不在於無意識的盲動。最重要的是在於「各盡其責」，在於實際的「做」。為謀「盡責」，所以本報决本去年所宣示於國人的計劃，以「實際做」的精神，從今開頭，逐步促其實現。</p>
<p>一、在編排方面，務使新聞與廣告兩相配合，力求明顯醒目。</p>
<p>二國外通釩，如歐洲，美國，蘇聯以及華僑，尤其是日本，務儘多刋載有系統之通訊。</p>
<p>三、國內地方通訊，力求普遍，於各地方的民生疾苦政治經濟情况，務求其能有系統的記載，東北失地現狀，尤為注意。</p>
<p>四、每週星期一就商業新聞的篇幅，編經濟專刋一種，詳誌一週內國內外的經濟上的變動，幷編製各種重要統計。商業新聞也逐步加以改善，務使其能為大衆閱讀。</p>
<p>五、自由談雖說只是一種副刋，但為調和讀者興趣，關係也很重大，今後刋載文字，約分長篇創作，短篇世界著名小說譯述，科學的故事，世界風士記，婦女和兒童的小品文字，以及幽默文字等，并時時常舉行有興味的民意測騐或懸賞徵文，務以不違背時代潮流與大衆化為原則。</p>
<p>六、讀者通訊一欄，於一二八後因篇幅縮小暫停，現重行恢復，改為「讀者顧問」。凡關於政治·經濟·法律·職業·婚姻·家庭·敎育·農村·自然科學·醫學·社會等問題的質疑，都由專家分別作答。</p>
<p>七、本埠增刊亦添刊長篇小說及店員通訊兩欄，每週星期日即就增刋篇幅，出版「業餘週刋」一種，以引起一般工友店員學徒的讀報興趣，灌輸以各種常識，并改善其業餘生活。</p>
<p>八、本埠增設流通圖書館一所，選購各種民衆常識應用的圖書，凡市民都享有借書的權利，幷力求借書手續上的便利。以此直接推進民衆敎育，間接亦即所以促進一般人業餘生活的改善。</p>
<p>九、增添各種附刊，如電影，業已附送；如經濟·業餘·建築·衛生·十二月起即可出刋；還有敎育·國貨·科學等亦將次第出版，都隨同本報分贈外埠，或僅限於本埠，務使讀者各就所好，獲得其所需求的知識和資料。</p>
<p>十、申報月刋現已創辦半年，月刋的貢獻，是申述論斷國內以至國際問現實政治經濟的情况，幷指陳其動向，以補日報之不足。</p>
<p>十一、申報年鑑正在編印中，明年三月即可與社會人士見面（現巳開始預約）。年鑑綜集一年來我國內政治經濟以至社會的主要事實，加以系統的叙述，附以各種重要的統計。每年出一鉅册，即不啻為我國國情逐年的信史。</p>
<p>十二、從去年起，本報已聘請專家從事編著我國內空前的精詳地圖，其實，此種材料早由各專家歷十餘年之長久歲月，搜羅測繪，現正在印刷中，明年即可出版。此外復聘請國內統計專家，編譯德國最近出版之世界社會經濟統計圖，并搜羅國內最近可靠的材料，加編關於我國方面的各種重要統計，共有統計圖百餘幅，說明數十種，目前正在努力編譯中。以上十二項，即為自十二月一日後本報每一期的努力計劃。自然，這還只是本報努力的開頭。</p>
<p>本報同人認為新聞事業為推進社會最有力的工具。尤其本報以六十年悠久的歷史，每日讀者至少在百萬人以上，更無異於為社會一架偉大的敎育機器。如何運用這架機器？如何使這機器發生偉大的力量和偉大的效能？當然，絕對不是本報少數同人所能勝任，而是需要着社會大衆的偉力加以推進。</p>
<p>同時，在另一方面，報紙亦無異於社會一架放音機，傳達公正輿論，訴說民衆痛苦，也正是報紙所應切實負荷的使命。然而此一使命是否能忠實負荷，當然也不僅在於少數本館同人，而尤其需要政府的愛護與扶掖。因此，在勞力工作的開頭，本報謹以十二分之虔誠，企待社會大衆的扶掖與指導。</p>

<h3>敬吿上海的中國朋友</h3>
<p>— 船津老人</p>
<p>中國有一　　　，「　人　　」，現在上海的多數中國人，有點兒庸人自擾的樣子，　　　　　現在上海的數百萬人因為物價非常的高，生活很困難，本來物價高漲的理由，原則上是因為物資缺乏，供不敷求的緣故，可是　　　　　　並不少，而　　高　有種種原因，最重要的　　　　和　　方面，　　各種謠言，極力搖動人心，擾亂市面，並有多數奸商，利用這些謠言，操縱物價，從中　利。因此，多數的民衆吃虧受苦，那麽中國人為甚麽這麽容易被人迷惑　　呢？這　有個緣故，仿佛身體虛弱的人，容易生病一樣，中國人對於將來的時局，看不清楚，所以一聽見謠言，就　　無措，我再進一步具體的　　多數中國人　心理，他　時常聽見　　和重慶方面放　的謠言，以為大東亞戰爭的最　，也許是　　　政，中國知　階級的人們也有這　　法的。旣然對於日本的將來已有懷疑的意思，對於兩　國民政府的將來，當然就有懷疑的意思；對於南京政府既有　　的意思，對於　　　　的鈔票，當然也有懷疑的意思。當然，人心搖動，物價奔　，囤積的毛　因此發生，民衆的困苦因此加倍，這都是因為中國多數人看不清楚時局的將來，對於日本的實在力量，也　　不足的結果。所以，我說這就是杞人之憂，又是庸人自擾了。</p>
<p>實際經騐一斑</p>
<p>一部分中國人看到這次　巴　投降，恐怕　國不久也是同樣的命運，到了那時候，日本方面必定受的影響很大，恐怕日本也　支持不住。這種看法完全不對的。我們相信歐洲的情形，無論如何變化，我們日本的地　　　也不會動搖。這囘大東亞戰爭是不能　三年就結束的，　　　　　　　　，至少到五年，也　到十餘年的。這麽長的期間，有時候或者有局部的戰敗，是免不了的。可是我們絕對的相信，最後的勝利一定在日本方面。並不是我憑空說大話，唱高調，是本　過去的實際經騐的。</p>
<p>甚麽叫過去的實際經騐呢？六百多年以前，蒙古來侵犯日本，我們完全打勝仗的歷史，暫且不提。我們和大淸國　俄國打仗，也是完全打勝仗。那年我們與大淸國開仗的時候，若比較兩國的軍力，我們主　的地位看起來，當然有把握了，盯是由　三　的人看起來，淸國是那麽大國，又有四萬萬人，華北　　　　　　，那時淸國　　北洋的　　　　　　　　　　），　　　　　大　　。日本最大的兵船不過三四千多噸，那　　的七千五百噸的戰綫，是問現在的七百五千　戰綫一樣，在世界上也　　　勢力最優勢的，所以由歐美各國的人看起來，日本一定敵不過淸國的，並　那時在　方的英國兵船，種種阻　日本　　的　　，　給　　的　　　中幫忙。但　淸國　　　　後，日本的陸海軍是為打勝仗，最　　大勝利了。英國就改變態度，不過　年，英國　　一步　日本　了　　條約了。</p>
<p>十幾年，我們和俄國開戰的時候，若比較　國的兵力，由第三國的人看起來，日本的陸海軍都　不過俄國，尤其是日本的海軍，　不如俄國的。所以那時候，歐美各國的人，看日本和俄國打仗，彷佛小孩兒和豆大漢子打架一樣，日本一定要失敗的，就是我們本國人，也不一定有把握，那麽我們為甚麽冒險，　俄　打仗　來　　？我　　　　　的　　　　：</p>
<p>庚子年（一千九　　　中　　　　之　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　不多　佔了滿洲地方，　　　　　　　　了，　　　　　，所以中國　　　　　　　　地方　　。可　　　　　　灣兵，他　　把高　　，也　　他的勢力範圍內，當時中國物力量，對於　　是無可奈何，所以日本不得已，自己出來要求俄國退兵。　　努力，交涉丁壬幾年，毫無結果，若是這麽樣挨過去的　　，日本雖然絕對的不至於亡國，可是一定落到三四等國了，那正是「戰亦亡，不戰亦亡」的情勢了。所以日本不得已而不　成敗　　。毅然把一國的命運作為孤注，對於俄國宣戰。經過整整的國年的戰事，幸而最後我們大獲勝利，這是年紀大點兒的人，大概都記着的事情。</p>
<p>認識日本國力</p>
<p>這囘日本對於在世界是最强有力的英美兩國　職，　三國的人看　　，也　過　　　　動，大　冒險，　　　　　　　　　　　　日本　　力　　不是，日本　　是　　　。日本的　　　　　　的手　，解決太平洋　　　，所以　　　　，煞　苦心，　　了好久，　　　　　　　　　大使，　　又　　來　大使，　　大使並不是外交官，　　他和　　　　　是　　　　友，來　大使也是　　，我們希望他們在　　　　。解決一　的問題。（我們從前請　　先生作過一回外務大臣也不過是一樣的用意）可是　　不但不應我們公正　　的要求，我們看破了他們的野心，到底是在把亞洲永遠作為我們的殖民地，　我們萬不得已，而　起與英美兩大國宣戰了，可是我們此次的決意，是愼重考慮，十分有了戰勝的把握，　開始行動的，國際上的情形，是與從前我們和俄國開戰的時候一樣的，可是我們的國力是比較那年我們與俄國的戰爭的時候强盛。果然，開戰以來，不多幾個月，打破了英美兩國在亞洲的根據地，把他們的勢力，　　　　　　　了，　　軍事上　　的　　　　　　等等，我們雖然　已　　　　　　　　　但是比較英　當然　　　　　　我們　　　　　　之後，所有的軍需品都比　　　　了。　在我們是守　　　的土地，　　　　　　　我們也　　　　上　　　　　們的的立塲比較開戰以前好得多，英美兩國現在　　　　　命的要　　我們所占　王　，在　　　方　苦戰，可是我們用孫吳　兵法，就是以進待勞的戰法，　敗他們，現在天時，地利，人和三樣重要　伴，全在我們。當然最後的勝利的理由，是兵船飛　　艇大砲等以外，我們日本人有不怕死的精神，　苦耐勞的奮　力，這是比那國的人都强。有了這個精神力，有了這個　　方，當然必勝不敗的了。我還有一句話，古人說「天下興亡，匹夫有責，」我想亞洲的興亡，我們亞洲人都得　責，這個大東亞戰爭，萬一失敗了，（這是雖然絕對不會有的）我們亞洲人，是永遠說了　　人的奴隸了，所以我們亞洲人應當　　　　，　　　　，有錢出錢，有力出力，有　出　，　　　苦，同生共死，必要　　了　利，　對利起我們　　　。</p>
<p>實現全面和平</p>
<p>有一　　，　　中國朋友，中國已經參加大東亞戰爭，應　　協助日本共同對英美作戰的義務，　是據說的　　，中國　　　　不必　　　或軍隊，前往前綫　作戰，目前在中國，自己　一件最要　，又利　　　的事情，這是汪主席熱心提倡的全　和平的問題，另若能　成了這　全國和平的工作，日本也可以馬上退兵，中國四萬萬的民衆，也能由水深火熱的痛苦裏頭救出來，我盼望中國四萬萬的人，同心協力的趕快作這個工作。若有反對或阻礙這個工作的人，這是四萬萬同胞的敵人，應該驅除這種沒有良心的人纔　部！</p>
<h3>中國政府與人民　應如何協力復興國家</h3>
<p>— 博多波</p>
<p>一年一度的國慶紀念，　今天已為第三十一度，檢討已往經騐，體會現在敎訓，策　未來計劃，眞不知有多少女　發表，但是對實際政治　民生改善，　　政不　　　　：並沒有甚麽改進吧！</p>
<p>今年的中國國慶日　　又　中報當局報文及　，鄙人受以「中國政府與人民應如何協力　　國家」之拙作。而為中　國慶特刋之點　，　以　　。</p>
<p>囘憶孫中山先生及諸革命先烈，那時為甚要推翻滿淸政府，而建立民團呢？想大部份人士，或許是為了改革政治，認為專制政權已沒希望，而變更共和民國之後，就可以國勢振作，强國富民，所以辛亥年十月十日武昌起義，全國　　，中華民團迅速告成，曾記得當時民團元年第一次國慶，正是孫先生蒞任就職大總統之期，此時氣象　　，普天同慶，國旗飛揚，舉國狂歡，紫金山色，　不少，誠為千載一時之機會，　今思之，此黃金時代之國慶紀念，竟一去而不復來，蓋自民國三年袁世凱之　　稱帝起直至民國十六年國民革命軍北伐完成以來，其間十餘年之久，干戈　　，內亂　起，相　不已，迄無　日，這自國民政府成立於南京之後，當民國十六年雙十節，氣象似有更新之望，但後忽共　赤匪擾亂爆發，蹂躪　中華西，以致民不聊生，竟東南之兵力未克平定，故自民國十六年至二十五年之間國慶節，亦復風　　　，忽忽過去。</p>
<p>民國二十六年國慶日，適値中日兩國不幸以兵戎相見之初，不意兵　　　，生民塗炭，至今已為民國三十二年國慶日，　　六年　未結束，所以民國成立雖已至十二年，但中國人民空間得了甚麽。我想　論是　，　會疾首　　　　此豈是創造民團　先　之　　　當　乃　中國政府與人民的責任，所以鄙人將此問題加以硏究，寫下這篇簡短文字，以就正於貴國　　人士之前。</p>
<p>政府方面如何協力</p>
<p>現在先將政府方面之協力復興國家方案分三點來說明一下：</p>
<p>加强東亞自覺性，國府汪主席曾說「中華民國誕生以來，已經三十多年，至今尙未能達到洽平之境者，考其原因乃由於中國對於東亞缺乏民族自　所致，」此乃正是一針見血之論，說到東亞民族自覺，便聯想及孫中山先生之大亞洲主義，那主義是欲從中國民族為一個單位來與另一單位相對立，此種民族思想，正如日本古來之「　人　」思想相同。不幸年來孫先生的繼承者，缺乏着東亞的自覺，以致淪為英美頹廢主義及狹隘的國家主義的奴隸，對於欲興中國締結着鄰的日本完全不能理解，而誤認日本是亞洲的帝國主義，此乃　由於英美的公式　所致，故自大東亞戰發生，接着中國參戰之後，一方面即把英美殘餘勢力肅淸，此卽可謂國內革命，另一方面因中日現在共向建設東亞新秩序之途邁進，故亦可謂之世界革命</p>
<p>中日全作觀念—今日　　中日兩國關係者，要均不能不論中國對於日本之　感，業已一新，亦卽中國對於日本　　多方向之　　，且由此認識進而採取　　行動，　就兩國澈底合作而言，中國力量之薄弱，就等於合作基礎之不　，是以欲加强中日合作基礎，對於充實中國實力，已不僅為中國之單獨問題，亦可為日本之問題，故日本政府亦一再聲明願意澈底協助中國復興，鄙人深信中日問題最後解決之日，卽中國復興完成之日。</p>
<p>安定民生第一—安定民生是培養人力的先決稚拙，培養充分人力，才能發揮　力功能，目前妨碍民生最大者，莫過於少數人之憑藉特殊背景，　行不法的貪汚份子，操縱市塲，投機囤積，尤以上海之現象為最甚，政治首領雖有肅淸貪汚之表示，而貪汚官吏之陽奉陰違，　未有舉　　　　之舉，例如澈查囤貨，初則雷厲風行，繼則烟消火滅，此中狀况，固非局外人所可推測，再如「民以食為天」的米糧配給，自從租界收回以來，祗聽到配給米的「展期」，「漲價」，「碱量」，「　劣滲砂」等一處悽慘小民嘆苦之聲，鄙人深知中國民間敢說沒有一人感到配給米的滿意，民食問題之　，團糟，空間何方　　耶，　不容主其事者之巧詞推諉，要知民心的　　，是施政成敗的最大試金石。觀於日言抑平物價，物價反而增漲，卽偶一跌價亦不及十分之一，但增漲之數額，乃全數十倍或百倍以上，曾憶韓文公有　「冬暖而兒號寒，年　而妻啼　」試問孰令致之，而至於斯。極一般貪汚盤剝之奸　　吏，則每　萬金而無所惜，紙醉金迷，　　　舞，不知有戰時景象。而哀哀小民則百死一生，終歲儉勤，仍　　　，此豈復興國家之道，故望政府當局以安定民生，消除貪汚列為第一主義，對於　　性之私利思　，　　　糾正。</p>
<p>人民方面如何協力</p>
<p>以上是關於政府者，茲統人民方面亦分三點明示：</p>
<p>價　政府理解時代意義——在此困難之非常時期，人民方面除絕對信任及服從政府外，必須充分理　當前的偉大時代是絕對的長期戰爭，不僅中自身貢獻一切，且要準備長期　　一切，以不怕苦，視死如歸的精神；求得共存共榮。對於私利　念，絕對摒除，投機囤積之舉，根本非　時人民所應為。一面旣要努力增加生產，一面更要極端節衣縮食；這是生死在望的關頭，亦即復興中國的緊要關頭呀！</p>
<p>改變新的國家觀念——此次世界大戰結束之後，東亞及歐洲必重建新秩序，故中國之現在參戰，不祗是對英美兩國宣戰，實欲表示中國在世界重建新秩序時亦佔一席之地位，故對於舊的狹隘的國家觀念，已不為時代合用，唯有以東亞同生共死的精神，而達成東亞共存共榮的事實，　大體而言，戰事勝敗之決定，主要由於國民犧牲精神之旺盛與否，所謂近代戰爭為國家德力戰者，亦即因此，故鄙人希望中國余民間均抱同生共死之決心，協力爭取最後勝利，進而復興中華民國。</p>
<p>提高國家至上主義之認識——中國人民由於英美文化侵略，使中國淪為物質文明下之犧牲者，以誤解之自由主義，及狹隘之民族主義，對於國家意識應　糢糊已極，所　現在中國正在　除昔日　　英美的劣根性，而以獨立自由的　位與日本站在同一陣綫上。要知日本人民均是國家至上主義的忠實信徒，無國即無民，人民對於一切財產，甚至生命均願貢獻國家，而國家亦決不蒙蔽共人民，猶如父母之愛護其子女般親切　　，保護其國民。鄙人切望中國人民亦應有此　念，而成為復興國家之基石。</p>
<p>總之，政府與人民，協力復興國家，是相繫的而非分離的，且中　民國主權在民，政府當局亦為人民一份子，人民　痛念過去之三十一年國慶，自應深悔放棄自己的責任，為今之計，自後必需立定脚跟，不敵勞瘁，負起責任先求　止和平之實現，繼而從事協力復興國家之策。庶句無負於　父孫先生及諸先烈。行　他日燦爛光　的中華民國；照耀於大東亞共榮圈中，此則為鄙人無窮之希望也。</p>
<h3>完成中國復興　努力生產建設</h3>
<p>— 武內文彬</p>
<p>每年的雙十節，常使愛中國的我們，沉醉於回憶的夢中。</p>
<p>深銘人心的革命　勛黎大總統，贈給我的大匾額：『光焰萬丈——武內先生惠存，黎元洪贈。』記載了革命三十三年來波瀾重疊的黃梁之夢，毫不吝惜地繪成了一幅第一次革命以來千變萬化，走馬燈般歷史的畫卷。那豐滿肥頒，常帶着慈父之溫顏的黎元洪氏；那在民國十二年滿懷着段祺瑞張作霖合作的希望而北上的國父孫文先生，在北京車站歡迎時的緊張情形；那在民國十六年，以破竹之　長驅而下，席捲江南一帶，在上海法租界行　的樓上賜予進見的意志軒昻的國民革命軍總司令蔣介石氏——那曾使上海變成死市的五卅事件等等，那許多革命的故事，都在我腦海中，重新呼吸而復蘇了。思想　來，蓋已長長的三十三年了。</p>
<p>宣統三年十月十日，　　於武昌起義的第一次革命，乃是長眠的「中國怪物」進向「新中國」的起步。如其說這進向新中國的起步，乃是第一次革命的本質，那麽我相信大東亞戰爭正就是預約這中國革命的完成。何以言之？中國革命的目標，對內在於滅滿興漢，確立共和民主制，對外在於撤廢不平等條約，　復為獨立的主權國。其對內的目標，在第一次革命中已大略完成，而其對外的目標，以大東亞戰勢為一　時期，因日本所主動提議及國交的　　而快　進入最後的成功之期了。本年一月九日的日本轉亦對華外交，約定把中國不平等條約的二大支柱—治外法權的撤廢，租界的交　。現在課稅權已由中國收囘，租界亦已交還完畢；不僅如此，　條首相且更聲明改訂中日基本條約，中國的成為完全主權國　好在目前，如此，中國的黎明　將　臨了，國父孫文先生所嗟　的「革命尙未成功」，　成過去，進向東亞大同之歷史的，必然的道路了。</p>
<h3>富國强兵之道</h3>
<p>說到「中國政府與人民應如何協力復興國家」，我的記憶中又想起來了二件事。一是日本的西洋經濟學之先驅者神田孝平氏的「日本國當前五項急務」；另一是軍國德意志之大空軍建設的深謀遠慮。茲先從前者說起。</p>
<p>神田華平和福澤論吉在日本同為從外國　入近代經濟學的先覺者，在明治維新（一八六八年）之前的八年，即文久元年，即早已提倡「商工立國論」。他在明治元年提出「日本當前五項急務」，詳細論列如次，五項為建國的要義。</p>
<p>日本應為永久獨立國，決不應為他國的附屬。</p>
<p>欲使日本獨立，不能不振起和此相應的國力。</p>
<p>欲振起國力，日本國內不能不舉國一致。</p>
<p>欲使日本國中　國一致，應使國人完全服從政府的政治。</p>
<p>欲使國人服從政府的政治，在政府方面應博採國內輿論，決不可泥於一說。</p>
<p>神田李平先生把建國的要　和國家　　的　　　　於上述五項，而從　提唱其實現這五項要約起來即　國家的獨立。　國力的充實。　舉國一致。　國民對政治的信服，　在政治上尊重輿論。這五項如其能夠完成，則國家達到孔子所謂「足食，足兵，民信之矣」的境城，為政者則　　了，「百姓足，君孰與不足。百姓不足，君孰與足」的境地。並開拓了「政，正也」的天地。朝野一體，官民一致　富國强兵的理想國家，於此得以完成。</p>
<p>者以此五項回顧今日中國的現狀時；不禁有「尙未焉！」之感，而不能不嘆為今日的義務　過於此了，一中國的　　　峰」梁啓超先生，在其「中國魂」中有一節論述漢人的長處與短處說：</p>
<p>缺處為　缺乏公德，　缺乏國家思想。　　於積極進取之念等。</p>
<p>長處為　寫於自治力，　　冒險獨立的性質。　長於學問，而思想為通　等。</p>
<p>所敎訓中國和我們的不能不感到　切實的話。</p>
<p>在明治大正昭和三　日本財　中最高指導者　　榮一　，　於　嘆政　的　　　落之餘，指　：「政治既非勢，亦非　政治顯然不能不是這　，這是政治的根本」，他　張政治，　德合一說，　為至　，而一脈相承於　子所說的「政，正也」的眞義，然而政治　不是　　的，消極的，政治常是　的，那常是積極的，　　　的，並不能不有着使民　　一的充分指導性，且這　　性不能不為理智且　　的指導性。</p>
<p>且政治以國民，民　為對象，所以政府的這指導，斷不是專對一人而發。政治在政府方面有　　民心歸　之　的　威並行政策之具體表現。民衆方面，有意識的服從政治　誘發自動的協力，不能不有從下而上的元氣充沛之態的國民組織和訓練，由於這種明朗的指導政治和保甲制度，新國民運動，靑年訓練等，以確立國民組織，實為今日中國的第一要務，而成為中國將來興亡的分界。中國四萬五千萬民衆打成一片，結合成深固的共同體，不能不說是打開中國現狀的要務中之要務。而為其中心者卽中日滿三國的團結。又這時候所欲要求於國民政府者，政府應吻合中國民衆之　在心理，固不必說，更應淸楚認識，有待於從上而下的指導，更大於民間自下而上的要求，國民政府必須立在這認　與責任感之上，把握住這雄偉的世界觀，聽從神　先生的領導，總動員中國全體民衆，中日互相提　，注其全力於　　英美，樹立東亞大同的大業。</p>
<h3>產業革命認識</h3>
<p>其次，試介紹德國痛快而　　的建設大空軍的一段故事。德國建設大空軍的大業，並不出於　　自大的驕　性，而立於　　的國家的自己反貪之上出　的，　並基於希特勒之聰明的理　與英斷之上的。茲略述一　歷史：</p>
<p>德國的希特勒政權確立於一九三三年。政權確立後希特勒立即致力於　　立國的大　，決心製造世界　一的　　。</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<h3>上接第一號</h3>
<p>當時的德國受和約的限制，並無　有空軍的權利。所以飛機工　尙　　　，其技術·費材亦不　　。希特勒　是向當時世界最　　的美國　　　　資材。　　　　的招聘美國技師。</p>
<p>在一九三三年以前。　然也曾零零碎碎的向美國　　，但至一九三三年　方是有　　的購買。引擎是從美國的拍拉　及　伊特納購買的。推進機是買的注彌　　·史丹　特的推進機。飛機用的電　計器，也是美國買的。此外，為了飛機的大　生　起　，派遣考　團，並招聘美國技師。這樣，這些資材，技術，因　學王國德國的學者，技術家之孜孜不倦的研究及　的靈　，竟至於淩駕美國之上，如在此次大戰中所表現的，　量都有　可驚的發逵</p>
<p>這種德圍的經驗，　訓了中國什麼呢？大概很多吧！而其重要之點應為自我認識，謙虛，和理智　事輕！如前所述，中國因第一次革命而開步向「新中國建設推進」，至大東亞戰爭而預定「新中國的　成」。而這新中國建設的大業，並不是容易完成的大業。並不是花言巧語，通電，掩耳盜鈴，實傳，虛張的所能完成的，那必須在官　一體，舉國一致；完全的國民總動員體制之下，由於政府之適　的指導，及國民之自奮的努力，始有可能。况中國的新建設以經濟建設為第一義，和依賴極深的英美經濟遮斷以後，唯有用歐府的理智，舉國家的總力，同時並淸　認　為大東亞共榮圈之一環，並自覺其資任，始能究成　者所造的新　詞「　　的產業革命」除此以外，　　絕無別法。</p>
<p>明治初期的日本大政治家大久保利通，在明治（七年一八七四年）的「　業　　會」上說：「大凡國家的强弱，由於人民的貧富，而人民的貧富，係於物產的多寡。而物產的多寡，胚胎於是否　　人民的工業……　詳細研究考慮之，以此相應於人民的性情與其知識的程度，設定一　的　則，振興勸業增產，勿使一夫怠其業，一民不得比所而憂。」用有力的富國强兵的意圖，氣冲斗牛的豪概，和力等　壁的氣魄，企圖完成之。為完遂中國之意識的產業革命之大業起見，中國應　有德國在航空工業上所表示的正確的自我　　建設戰爭並行</p>
<p>佛語曰：「此為難事，宜發大願」。在一面建設，一面戰爭的難境下，欲建設新中國，完　其基本的意識的產業革命，正為天下的大業，因而又為非發大願不能有大成的大事業。筆者以為盟邦中國的朝野，如其覺悟這中國事態的重大性，回　日本明治維新的敎訓，　　　德國大空軍建設的敎訓，在正確的自我認識下，　然向建設新中國的一路邁進，　中國的　運。　有入眼天空待蛟能之概。</p>
<p>總之，一中國政府與人民協力復興國家的要諦之根源，在政府方面，應自覺以新中國的建設為有輕於自上而下的指導的大黨，在國民方面應確立完善的國民組織。（宋譯）</p>
<h3>爭取戰爭的勝利</h3>
<p>— 小山義一</p>
<p>「中國政府　人民應如何協力復興國家——」這一題目，我敢簡單的答復，抱定堅實的心理，政府與人民一數協力，　　　　　　的熱情來　　占爭。唯有如此，國家才會　　，民族也能繁榮。</p>
<p>新中國　戰以来，巳　　　十　月。在此期間，在汪主席領導之下，逐步整頓戰時體制，這是我們目睹的事貿，但是在物質雙方，尙不能謂巳經確立了決戰體　。</p>
<p>糾正國民思想</p>
<p>大胆的說一句，在這個戰爭中的國民之態度，還有使人可疑　。</p>
<p>例如：囤積事件。假使能夠正視國家所遭遇的艱難事態，在民族的全體上着想，那就不會再有這種自私自利的舉動了。</p>
<p>然而這種不幸事件的發生，不公僅是民衆的責任。給予機會而使發生此種事件的政府之責任，當然也不得不問。</p>
<p>收囘租界之後，汪主席力言：要確立中心思想。大家要有國父孫總理的意志，如有受過英　思想毒素的心理，應該把它澈底掃隊，須有中調獨自的思想。唯有思想故着，才是現在中國官民所應該做的最重要工作。</p>
<p>我們目下正在戰爭中。而這個戰爭是為了東亞民話，為保衛東亞的戰爭。假使以為這個戰爭是為了　們的戰爭，　　是大大的錯誤了，要曉得這戰爭是為子孫計　戰爭，為東亞民族樹立百年大計的戰爭。應該想一想　現在我們屈服，那末我們的子孫未來將如何呢？在這一點上，中日的命運　無分別，彼此認　同生共死的眞正精神，携手　來向爭取勝力邁進。</p>
<p>確立決戰體制</p>
<p>這個精神　設　令體民衆都能明瞭，則不平與不滿的情緒，自能解消。為使此　精神的澈底，政府應該實施一切必要措施。持身公下，愛護人民，苛有不正　事發生，　應　不假借地追究，以期掃蕩一切不良份子，唯有此種態度，才是官方的態度，政治力由能因之而貫澈，民心也得以把握，國家的獨立自主，也能完整了</p>
<p>一　應付外敵，同時制服內敵的方法，我以為也在於此，如能使和平區民衆理解戰爭的意義，確立眞正的決戰體制，則確　重慶治下之民衆，自然来歸，覺悟兄弟　墙之愚，拋棄英美走狗之屈辱的地位，為東亞民族計，我相信他們必有崛起的一天，為求這一天早一點來，所以我竭戾希望國府治下的官民，應該確立渾然一體，毫無，膜的的體制。（企靑譯）</p>
<h3>新中國的使命</h3>
<p>— 橫田高明</p>
<p>中國政府與人民，應該　橫協力國家復興，歸納起來；大概有左列三點方法：</p>
<p>拋棄武器，實行全面和平。</p>
<p>不幸的中日戰爭發生之時，中日兩國彼此都有極深的誤解，一誤再誤，使國家與國民都走上了錯誤的方向，結果增加了不幸。緣中日戰爭發生時，中國的指導者，認為：「日本是恃武力來侵犯中國的領土與主權」，故而要抗日。</p>
<p>一方面日本以為：「中國依存英美，與英美美結合，企圖阻碍日本國運的發展」，因之執戈而起。對於：「為英美而出　東亞的中國之過去指導者蔣介石，斷然予以膺懲。</p>
<p>但是，六年來不幸戰　之中，顯示了日本並無侵害中國領土與主權的意思。現在日本對國府交還租界，撤廢治外法權，尊重國意的主權與責任，力謀中國國家的獨立輿民族的自强，可見得日本絕無野心。</p>
<p>谷萩少將對重慶也會明白昭示：「現在抗戰的目的，已被逵到，中國的獨立自主，巳被保設，化干戈為玉事，願在歡笑之中決事」。因誤會而起的抗戰的理由，早就消滅了，那未中國民眾就先應該知道抗戰是沒有理由的。為了沒有理由的抗戰而互相消耗國力，再沒有比它更無意義的了。假使要想到它不僅是無意義，而且有多大危險性，那麼，這個戰爭就應該立即停止。中日民族，是東亞兩大領導的民族，彼此作無理　爭而消耗自己的力量，此無異導整個亞洲人自　　亡，這實在是要不得而應該避免的。</p>
<p>放棄依存英美</p>
<p>中日事變發生以來，蔣介石為了要和日本對抗而依存英美，接受軍火與財政上的援助，但是要認淸英美的援渝，是　有欲置中國於英美支配下的盜辣陰謀。換句話說，中國為了要排除日本的侵略，反而引狼入室地導追了英美的侵略魔手，結果弄成身不由自主的局面。在今次戰爭中，假使協約國得勝，則英美對華支配力必然增大，使中國欲泣不能。蔣介石一派猶謂：此次戰爭，協約國獲勝的塲合，中國的獨立可以完成，民主政治可以實現，然而中國民衆之中信此言者極少，且斷然沒有那種事情</p>
<p>何以呢？因為英美的占爭目的在於制霸世界，所以在戰後要他無條件的承認中國獨立自主，這是斷斷乎　不到的。義國巴政權的投降，就可證明英美用心之險噁。英美一旦把　世界最大權力之時，決不會顧到中國的要求　中國人的理想。相反地可以斷定他對　忽視與蹂躪。而且，使中國屈膝於英美勢力之前，不僅是中國之不幸，實為東亞十萬萬全民族的最大不幸。這件事情，我們祇要想一想鴉片戰爭以來。百年間英美在中國幹些什麼，自然會明白的了。不，不但是中國受其茶毒，即就是印度，越南，泰國，爪哇，菲律賓，又何常不受英美荷的欺壓呢？思念及此，能不慄然。而現在中國又將重蹈覆轍。唯有目前，中國必髯打破依存英美的迷夢。</p>
<p>支持日本</p>
<p>東亞民族，終究是東亞民族。無論蔣介石與邱吉爾，羅斯福如何親密，而中國民族，終究還是東亞民族，總不能永遠和英美提　協調。何　　能與英美給合呢？因為英美自命白人為優越人種，而且有征服世界的野心，所以英美與東亞民族的全面融合是絕對不可能的。這一次的世界大戰，即使如蔣介石之願：協約國獲得了勝利，然而，在次一階段，中國民族必被英美征服無疑。所以，在這次戰爭中，英美勝利這件事，並不能根本解決東亞問題。東亞問題的根本解決，必須要東亞民族、一致團結，來解放東亞民族，確立東亞國家的地位。要做到秋一　，除了以日本為中心而團結努力以外；別無其他辦法。六年來，應付中日事變，　年十二月八日起，又以英美為對手，發動大規模戰爭，尤其是在大東亞戰爭之初，獲得驚震世界的煊赫勝利，目前確保西南太平洋一帶的廣大資源地帶，　　推進作戰，由此可以證明日本的國力是如何雄厚，再就優良的武器而　，在其科學的進步上，絕不　於英美。這不是可以證明在任何一點上都是優秀嗎？中國民衆，現在常然可以認識日本的實力超出了世界的水準。顯然日本可以指導亞細亞全民族，具有足以確立亞細亞國家在世界上地位的實力。唯有現在，中國要拋棄錯誤的依存英美心理，以日本實力為中心，樹立眞正解決亞細亞的方策，換句話說，中國必須傾其全力，支持日本，使日本可以獲得這佃戰爭的最後勝利。汪主席所謂同生共死，才是爭取國家復興的唯一方途。除此以外，再不能得到中國生存之道。（企靑譯）</p>
<h3>中國復興的大道</h3>
<p>— 栗本寅治</p>
<p>中國的先哲曾說：「修身，齊家，治國，平天下」。日本人民以此作為最寶貴的格言，朝夕口誦之，且躬行實踐此敎　。因為日本人信奉為寓古不滅的大敎典。一切國家，砍謀復興，　國民不能不先修身齊家，而在朝者不能不收攬大衆的人心，捨身治國。這樣，國始治而天下太平。故修身齊家治國平天下的格言，實可說是中國國家復興的原素。</p>
<p>是以執行政冶的官吏，應淸廉公正，潔身自愛，人民應各忠實於其本分，官心民心打成一片，而效忠誠於國家而且官吏百姓當然皆應涵　尊生國家的精神，使成為値得尊國家。故應正確地認識雖些微小事，皆足以影　國家，社會因而各人　　在任何塲合，不應有忘掉國家的行為。如其各人以為祇有自己個人這樣做，不致有很大的影響，也不會有很大的弊害，因而每個人如不在自己本位上努力，則那社會恐怕完全　成一團糟，那國家的復興，渺不可期，而國勢亦日　衰微。故各人常在個人之一舉手，一投足上，有着修身隨行的考慮，實為協力於國家復興的最大的地方。</p>
<p>們不想在這裏批判中國的國民性，也不擬指摘中國人的短處。也不是以日本　及日本人的地們，主觀地觀察中國。不過想率直地述說自己的成就，以供協力的參考。</p>
<p>愛國心的運用</p>
<p>現在大多數中國人士之中，可充分承充分承認充滿着熱烈的愛國心。然詳細檢討起來，在其愛國的定義上，和我們大不相同，因而產生種種質問。電慶方而的政治，口頭上雖然叫着愛國，但其行為是否　悖於眞正的愛岡。如其他們尙相信是眞正的愛國的行為，那麼所謂愛國的定義，從東洋道德的觀點說來，不能不說是　為錯談的思想。重慶的政治如其從眞正的愛國心出發，則中國的事態，不致於如今日的地步。也不敎於　成不能不大呼復興國家的事　吧！那麼重慶政治產生破綻的原因何在呢？實是偽裝的愛國政治。蔣介石一派的行為，一切都發端於私利私慾，可說是完全由於私慾而推動的。</p>
<p>又如其把蔣介石氏尊為英　偉人當作是中國民衆之愛國心的發　，並以為這就是敎育靑年層後所產生的愛國心，這也是極差誤的，且不能不說是低調而煽動的愛國敎育，在這　義上，州在中國的　民，必須如道眞正的愛國的什麼。這才　說是協力復興中國國家的第一　　體方法。</p>
<p>在涵養　正確的愛國心上，政治便可以廉明公正人而良好的政治產生良好的社會，良好的社會如能產生，就有良好的經濟。如其具備了良好的經濟，則民心安定，幷相信能促成眞正的國家復興。</p>
<p>改良敎育方法</p>
<p>中國的民衆，本與別的非文明國人不同，乃是敎則習之，習則行之的民衆，這在歴史上巳經證明了。所謂道德的淵源，實在於中國，所以今日的中國政治，首先應自正確的愛國敎育始。大膽說來，中國的目前，在每種塲合所見的中國人中，雖也有的確値得尊敬的人士，但在國家的上觀察時，孔孟之敎掃地。這不用　是敎靑　弛的緣故。革命成立後的中國敎育界，在衫而下的方面，不是沒有値得一觀的束西，但在其形而上的方而，即說是完全錯誤的愛國心的煽動敎育，亦非過言。今日中國人中抱着最穩健思想的人士，大概都是受過聖賢　敎的人們。距今三十餘年前的私塾敎育，在家庭中迎養先生的敎育方法，還較優勝。吾人撫今顧昔，不禁感慨良深。正確的敎育之促進，實為目前的急務，且是協力國家復興的大方策之一，</p>
<p>現在的中國政治界上，通曉世界情勢的人士可說極少。所以對情勢愛化的判斷，無論朝野，似均非常遲鈍。其結果意志常在動搖，難得固定信仰。而且成為惑於謠言蜚語的原因，離至於竟然樂於相信這謠言的傾向非常强烈。尤其在大東亞戰爭勃發以後，在中國有識階級者之間，不少人倘點着重慶和南京的二頭馬，取隔岸觀火的態度。這種態度是因為大家沒有確信，而沒有確信的結果，在中國國家的復興上，不僅沒有何種促進的動力，反有非常惡劣的傾向。內雖能齊國，對外如無因盟邦的友好關係而獲得强力援助，則欲完成國家復興的目的，大為困難。今日的國家，不保持國際的關係之存在，毫無意義。礦對外關係，應日趨　睦修好，苟有背信的行為者，那國家祇有滅亡。最近義大利巴政權的背信行為，不是說明了嗎？信義貿是國家復興的偉力。所以在內，澄淸這不鮮明的政界空氣，拋棄知識階級的二脚跨主義（在交易所中），用以積極的擁護南京政府，信賴汪政權，更多的注力於政冶力的强化，而愈加敦睦親善和盟邦的關係。尤其在上海，此時斷然向建成政治經濟一體的基礎而邁進，實為協力國家復興的重要事項，</p>
<p>經濟界的肅淸</p>
<p>經濟界的肅淸，是中國國家復興的必須條件。良好的經濟界顯現時，即是投機的惡劣分子之絕跡期）這如其等閑視之。則中國國家復興無　。注其全力於掃除此等惡劣分子，大有助於同家復興的大業</p>
<p>中國的社會構成分子的大部分是農民。農業可說是國家的根本。而且沒有一樣東西象　業尋樣易為自然條件所左右。在今日以前雖誇說是　　，一旦遭風雨襲擊，一切都被奪去。不把這最大的危險當什危險而勇散地耕　農地的農民。實可說是中國的國寶。但是有剝削那農民的不正當手段，把農產物當什投機對象的投機份子之橫行，是難容的罪惡。誠為惡劣的存在，尤以參戰中國的目前情勢，正是必須尊重農村經濟，優遇農民，使他們努力增產的時候，使他們疲弊困憊的惡劣的投機者和囤積者，不能不　底消滅。且　商業者　其眞實的商業的使命也為國家復興的一種大助力。</p>
<p>把上　所說的要約　来說，所有國家的人民，如共沒有超越愛國的精神，　國之士的覺悟，則上述具體的協力方法，也不一定能完成國家的復興。</p>
<p>參戰中國今日期待這種憂國之士，誠極切要，</p>
<p>產業的增產擴充，商業的溝通交流，金融的圓滑調整，財政的强化健全，善政的普遍暢達等，均賴憂國的精神始有可能。故復興國家首在國民的修身，終在於憂國的精神。（翔譯）</p>

<h3>對復興中國　一個前提的認識</h3>
<p>— 川崎正雄</p>
<p>世界戰局現在　向最後的決戰階段，而日益展開激烈的戰門。當論及申報館向　者所徴求的「中國政府與人民應如何協力復興國家」時，我以為把大東亞戰爭在此次世界戰爭中的性格，或中國對此應持的態度，如置之度外，則不能進行考察。所以　者在論述政府與人民應如何協力以復興國家之前，就為其前提的　點，略述　者的見解。</p>
<p>從歷史上考察戰爭</p>
<p>先　此次世界戰爭的性格來考察，我們不能不把問題的解剖遠溯至一九二九年的世界經濟恐慌。何以言之？蓋這是一轉機，英美資本帝國主義和新興國家日本，及在近代的民族國家形成過程中的中國等，彼此的對立，漸見露骨，而終於造成今日的戰爭。一九二九年的世界經濟恐慌，使欲逃避這恐慌的各國，走向經濟的國家主義。一九三二年七月，英國在　夭華舉行英帝國經濟會議，極端强化英帝國相互間的經濟聯繫，對他國關閉門戶。美國以一九三三年十二月的第七次泛美會議為契機，加强南北美的紐帶，着手實施門羅主義。這樣，世界經濟圈以英美的為其先驅，各取極端的排他政策。如一九三三年七月在倫敦舉行的世界經濟會議，原擬修正世界的這種經濟的國家主義方向，但因美國從利己主義立塲出發的反對，而竟不能不至於無聲無臭的閉幕，即共一例。當時以威爾遜總統的心腹而活躍的哈華斯上校，提倡「殖民地再割分論」，把二三國家所獨占的殖民地，加以合理的再分割，而想置於世界的新秩序之上。又法國的白里安氏主張「歐洲合衆國論」，想在經濟上重建歐洲全體國家。這些都是想避免在醞釀中世界戰爭的危機，而為防患於朱然的一種修正現狀的傾向之表現。英美的資本帝國主義，完全漠視這傾向，而一意向强化經濟的國家主義之途邁進，以為經濟的制霸世界之一過程。嚴密地說來，這種傾向，業已包含在英法美之企圖支配世界及壓制新興國家的第一次歐洲大戰的遺產凡爾賽和平機構中。唯一九二九年的世界經濟恐慌，使口頭上提倡理想主義的英美不能不完全揭開其假面具，而最露骨地表現其經濟的支　世界之野心。我們重視一九二九年的世界經濟恐慌，即以此故。自此以後，這種傾向日趨强化，以致於造成此次世界大戰的　發。某評論家曾指稱：「英美法等維持現狀的諸國，或在國際軍縮會議上，或在聯盟至少主義的形式上，　其餘的諸國，一面强行要求以他們為本位的世界和平機構，</p>
<p>一面則强化自身的經濟的集團，而拼命想完備經濟的武裝。英國的舉國一矜內閣之出現及其政策，美國羅斯　總統之就任及新平衡政策之於行，法國的歐洲金本位集團之組織及法蘇互助條約的締結等，完全說明了這傾向。所以在世界經濟恐慌以後的國際動向，國際主義是表面的假而”，而其眞正的內容　是尖銳的國家主義。如其要辯明民界戰爭的責任，即是這國家主義的暗流。」這　我們完全表示贊同。滿洲事變的發生，納粹德國的出現及其退出軍縮會議，義大利和阿比西尼亞二國問的糾紛，及該國的退出國際聯盟，均為英法美的經濟的國家全義所產生的。我們視為這種事件的累積，是結果使世界戰爭勃發，並使大東亞戰爭發生的原因，其性質乃是民族生存權的要求對英美經濟帝國主義之鬥爭。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的分析</p>
<p>如其把大東亞戰爭的性質這樣分析起來，那麼我們不能不討論本文所討論的基本問題——中日關係。先從日本的立塲來看，日本自明洽維新以來，歷經日淸，日俄並第一次世界大戰，其國運蒸蒸日上，其人口急劇地膨脹起來，國內敎育的普及和工業之急速發達，是大家所都巳知道的事實。這在土地狹隘的日本，必然地需要確保足夠的維持膨脹的過剩人口之食糧，確獲對英美制霸世界而防衛自己所需要的軍需資源，並為圓滑地輸入這些食糧及資源所必嬰的振興貿易。此種要求，乃日本在維持其生存上絕對的條件。然而獨占世界的資源和市塲的英美，如上所述，對日本關起門來，這傾向自一九二九年以來特別顯著。於是日本為維持其生存起郵不能不講求各種方法。對擁有廣大的土地和人口，而暫殘留於英美經濟集團之外的唯一的市塲中國，向已有着　深一層的關心。因此，日本之向中國的進出，乃為了民族的生存而當然提起的要求，並沒收什麼侵略的意義。那和英美蘇已擁有很多的資源及殖民地，但猶在制覇世界的野心下，想把中國置於其壓制下的資本帝國主義行徑，完全異趣。中國曾有很多入批難日本的對華政策，那是他們沒有想到，日本的對華政策，在基本上決不是基於侵略的意圖而實行的，乃是基於想找民族的出路之切實的要求。</p>
<p>一面看中國的情勢時，有幾千年歷史的封建的政治形態，也就時代的洗禮而趨崩潰的過程，經第一次第二次並大革命後，民族國家的形成漸見進展，這在長時期困於英美壓迫下的日本，在原則上　歡迎為保衛東亞的同志之中國國家的成長，　中國的民族國家之形成過程，雖朱必和日本的期待相一致，尤其當中國的至少可說在民族意識的某礎上成立之最初的統一政府，即　南京政府成立時起，與其說對日協調，毋甯說和英美妥協，政府的基礎，胡立在這方針之上，而取遠交近攻政策，眞是不勝遺憾。所以自從前南立政府成立以來，中日關係常欠圓滿，蔣介石亦想在使民衆引起對日惡感上，鞏固其民族國家的基礎。這就是對一九三五年以來日趨熾烈的人民統一戰終，雖明知幕後由中共操縱而不能不加以彈壓，但却又昻揚他們的抗日意識，以鞏固自己的地位，而彷徨於這種矛盾的政　之間的事實　明。從我們說來，中日事變的發生，　是這種排日政策的產物。</p>
<p>現在考　前南京政府的這種排日政策的根據何在時，似乎有著資本帝國主義者套著自由主義的假面具，玩弊許多狡猾的手　　！更根本的　。前南京政府不能　解日本的對華政策的本　乃出於民族生存的要求，反在和英美的勾結下，以此排斥為侵略的行為。當然，以前日本所裏　　對　　策決不能說毫無遺憾，但在這裏有著很多的誤解，那也是事實吧！而且此等誤解累積起來，常至於訴之干戈。可是我們所能斷言者，在中日問題上，無論發生如何誤解，如上所述，決小，日本的侵略政策的　思。主樣看時，中日在過去是應該互上提携的，然而因相互缺乏理解，發生不幸事件，　就可以明白了。</p>
<p>現因大東亞戰爭的　　日本解放了，以前曾為英美荷等帝國主義政策所深閉固拒的南洋方而的廣大土地與民衆。今後日本曾基於民族的要求的諸政策，沒有對中國施行的必要了南洋的廣大土地與人民從英美荷解放之後，中日間以前發生誤解的原因，不苒存在了。大東亞共榮　的建設，不用說，自是基於從英美的桎梏之下解放東亞賭民族，使各得其所這遠大的理想即單從上述中日關係看來，把英美帝國主義遂出束亞，亦為中日雙方所應負起的絕對的任務。</p>
<p>常我們想論述對國民政府及其治下人民的協力問題並中國復興的簡單的見解時，而所以不憚辭費，提起這前提的認識者，實以從現在的國民政府之性格而言，人民對以上情形如無明確的理解，則不能有完全的協力，並且是無意義的。</p>
<p>政府的反省</p>
<p>「中國政府與人民應如何協力復興國家」這題目，用別的話表現起來，就是說：在現在，國民政府與人民尙沒有完全協力，所以在國家的復興上，也沒有使用了全面的努力。事實上，我們檢討國民政府的政治時，談不到和人民有完全的協力，因此，國家復舉措問題遂留下來作為檢討的題目。那麼，政府和人民協力的餘地在那一點呢？以下試先從對政府方面的希望說起。</p>
<p>國民政府還都時所揭　的，即在今日也尙是基本口號的「和平，反共，建國」，任何人對之毫無異方，然而和平區的人們，一國民政府的協力都嫌不夠，現實上，而由對政治冷淡的分子擔任。並且即在新政策轉變後，一般民衆對政府的印象也不一定好。這自然有很多的原因，而一般的說來，都說到政府官吏的不廉潔。汪主席在還都半年　的九月末，對中央黨務訓練團　辭中，說到廉潔問題：「本來對一個做官的人說「你要廉潔」多少近於侮辱。　如對新婚夫婦說：你要貞潔，這不是過於唐突嗎？因為不貞潔都做不成了。不廉潔何賞不是一樣。「眞的，對官吏說廉潔，實是大的侮辱，但是現實的事態，未必正如理想一樣，我們並不想用某某官吏怎樣收受禮物的具體事實過而闡釋我們的論旨，但據種種傳說，最近官吏的收受賄賂，相當露骨，甚至於有勒索者。這些事情是虛是實，又當別論，但這種流言的本身有關係政府的信用者實大。而事實上現在的國民政府不獲好評的原因，似亦在於此。　淸朝宋期的官塲小說「官塲現形記」　，很明白淸朝時代的政　腐敗情形，現在和當時自然不能比較，然而在大東亞戰爭突入決戰階段的今日，如其依然有官塲現形記的殘　，那是絕對不應有的。立法院長陳公博氏曾在其「廉潔政治論」中說：「可是，我再想想，在許多事要做而急做之上，還有一件事要做，卽是「樹立廉潔政治」，而我認定廉潔政治是和平建國的基本條件，倘若政治不能廉潔，絕不能得到和平，政治不能廉潔，也不能達到建國」，又說：「自事變以後，重慶許多人們借著統　的美名，發了許多「國難則」，人們讀到這些不肖的官吏和不良商人，無不痛心切齒。可是我們旣不忍看著重慶方面的人們在那裏大發其國難財，我們就難道忍心袖手看著國民政府治下的人們在那裏大發和平財嗎？我不禁大聲疾呼喚起我們有心和有志的人士注意」，我們也和陳公博氏同樣主張廉潔政治的實施乃建國的必要條件。然而檢討這官吏墮落的原因時，決不祗是那缺乏和平信念的簡單原因，大多並也含着習性的原因。而且跟着戰爭階段的進展，生活也愈趨困苦，這也成為主要原因之一。我們所希望於政府者，乃是最嚴格的責任政治體制之確立。至少據我們所見，不限於現在的國民政府　在中國的任何時代，情面對於政治的支配，極為有力，這必然的使政治堕落，因而不能實施廉潔政治。排除情面，使各官吏行責任的政治，不能不是官民協力的重大要諦。否則政府縱設下了千百條的法令，在政治的改進上，亳無效果。</p>
<p>其次所應提出的，乃政府應加强和人民的接觸。國民政府再建的目標，自然在於和平建國，換言之，從戰禍中挽救中華民族，在可能範國內使之安定。政府和人民的利益本來是完全一致的，然而觀察國府還都後以至今日的情勢時，政府和和平區人民的協力，是否亭無間隙呢？我們所見，殊以為未必盡然。政府的一切施策，縱在主觀上，客觀上有着妥常性，但當實行時，不是常需要民間機關的動員而表示熱心贊助嗎？不問是共和政體的國家，或全體主義國家，在任何塲合，政府唯有立於民衆協力的基礎上，始能順利地實施其政策。否則難期圓滑的推行。對此，某人曾說，其事實蹤令暫予承認，但雖在還都之後，現實之政治的經濟的情勢，和從前並無多大差別。這當然也是一說。然而在中國參戰後，國府政治力極力昻揚的現在，說到和人民協力的手段，和還都後未見有何大變更，而痛惑到國民政府關於民衆動員多少有加以積極考慮的必要。大東亞戰爭勃發後展開的新國民運動，及因上海公共租界的交還而中國主權確立，以此為契機，汪主席直接與上海民問指導者交換意見，乃是關於國府的民衆動員以至强化民間聯繫之顯著表現。但我們並不以此為滿足，而不能不希望進一步的具體措置。</p>
<p>人民的反省</p>
<p>中國人對新政府的出現一般地常表示極消極的態度。這是支配形態之屢次變更使然。僅就上海一地考察起來，即在中華民國成立以後，以各軍閥為背景的封建勢力之更迭，有十數人之多，前南京政府在抗日的色彩下誕生，還都後的國府以對日協力為基本政策。所以他們從防衛自身的見地出發，與其注力於積極的協力時代的支配者，毋甯在利潤的追求上生活，這是極當然的。關於此點，不能不歸咎於以前中國政治的不上軌逍，同時，還都後不過三年，且因重慶政權抗日政策的存在，國內的戰爭狀驢依然繼續著的現狀下，人民縱使不立卽對還都國府的施策不表示積極的協力，也並不是不可思議的。從這種意義出發，我們可自說人民　政府的協力，必須假以充分的時日，才最為得當。然而我們從另一個角度出發，即從大東亞戰爭的性格並戰爭正在激烈進行中的印狀下考察起來，則中國民衆的這種消極態度，不能不立即加以淸算，　沒有大東亞戰爭的完遂，即自主國家的中國不能存在，因而為使大東亞戰爭完遂起見，現在中國的協力，一　也不容猶預。中國民衆被要求對國民政府協力的必要性，無過於今日之切者。然而眺望我們的周國時，　澈這種時代的精神，積極的盡著作為中國人民的本分之民間人士，究有徒然加以非難，對中國的更生並無何種效果。</p>
<p>中國百年來受著英美的侵略，變成其殖民地，其農產物大部分用作英美的原料品，商業活動成為英美資本之　　的存在，但因英美政策極為狡猾，故大部分中國人士。對英美的經濟侵略，並不發生反感，反認為這是通常的現象，以至於今日。他們依靠着英美之經濟的支　中國，而分潤若干利益，而　到這是最安定的經濟生活。所以國民政府無論怎樣宜傳和平建國，無論怎樣闡釋大東亞戰爭的意義，然而言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，只如東風之過耳。</p>
<p>但最近大東亞戰爭進展的結果，由於日本的　助，中國收囘了所有的導管租界及公共租界，且緬甸巳告獨立，葬列濱亦將近獨立，南洋諸民族亦允許其參與政治，因此，日本所提倡的大東亞建設，事實證明是從道　義出發的以為實現大亞細亞主義的前提，必須先完成中國之近代的國家。這是當時中國應走的路。三民主義中以民族主義為中心者，即以此故。汪精衛氏　離重慶抗日政權，根據和平反共建國而實現還都，其政府所　的使命，也在於建設民族的近代國家。大東亞戰爭的勃發，對民族國家的建設。同時，對大東亞共榮圈的建設，對中國要求積極的協力，在這裏國民政府在不同於日本的意義上，見到共責任的重大，與此同時，當然成為問題者，以形成民族國家。假使中國民衆洞察這種世界史的新動向，為新中國的建設而放棄以前的消極態度，則政府和人民的一體化，業已不成問題，而作為完全自主的中國建設之基本條件，可說巳告完備。還時　我們說起中國的人民來，不徒然墨守以前的保守態度，而是最順從政府指導的人民。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>說起大東亞共榮圈的建設，在我們早巳完成近代國家的國家中過生活者，比較的能容易理解其必然性。然而　中國在完成民族國家途中的人們，欲求其理解，不無若干困難。孫中山先生的最後目標，誰也承認是大亞細亞主義之實現，孫中山先生亦的要求為主的課題不能不就是以建設大東亞共榮圈的要求為主的髁題。依　們的見解，不用說應以大東亞丑榮圈建設為先，國民政府不能不先對完遂大東亞戰爭予以全面的努力。　如前所述，自主獨立的新中國之建設，把企圖制霸世界的英美逐出大東亞，確立大束亞共榮圈時，始能寶現。蹈著和英美勾結路綫的重慶政權之迷夢，縱令實現，亦無非是把支　重慶當作英美所制覇的世界中之一環而巳。道即在重慶政滬內部的人們亦已承認。他們雖競競於對日本的大東亞共榮圈建設之　　措　的進展，但依然不改抗日政策和勾結英美路綫者，因他們恐怕這樣做了之後要喪失自己的政治生命的緣故。可是他們今日雖說著「抗戰建國」，但不感到很人的魅力。</p>
<p>為中心的大東亞共榮圈如能建設起來，則民族國家的中國之形成，不成問題，　建設大東亞共榮圈之聯合國家的形態，因較在民族國家形成過程中的國一家之政治觀念更為重要，故毋甯說中國的民族國家之形成，因大束亞的建設而更加上一層刺激。所以現在所要求於中國者，祗在政府與人民打成一片，向所負使命邁進。前而所述「政府的反省」及「人民的反省」中所說諸點，不過是在完成這使命上所附帶提起的一二問題而已。（翼譯）</p>
<h3>復興中國認識大東亞戰爭　日高淸磨瑳</h3>
<p>現在日本在大東亞發動的戰爭，汪主席也曾說它是大東亞民族的解放戰爭，負一國安危實任的注主席都如此想，我以為中國的智識階級，必然也作此想的。但信念的程度也有深淺，然而形成中國與論的人們，一定都能相信的。</p>
<p>假使有人斷定這次大東亞戰爭是日本的侵略戰爭，那末我敢斷定：那種人是絕　沒有判斷力的，何以呢？我想那種人，或許沒有　過日本天皇陛下的宣戰大詔，而且他沒有明瞭日本對待大東亞各國各民族所實施的政策。</p>
<p>對於這種人，我願作一次忠告：</p>
<p>「你假使要研究日本，請你在硏究日本工業，日　本都市，日本地理之前，先把日本的國體硏究一　下，所謂硏究日本國體者，就是謂你研究建國以　來二千六百年的日本皇國傳統與日本國民對於天　皇陛下的精神。不知日本的國體，就不能理解騰正的日本。」</p>
<p>中國也有硏究日本國體的專家，我雖見聞不廣，但也知道在中國民間先蜚之中，有一位杜天一先生，他就是研究日本國體的人。據我所知，平常的外國人，他們研究日本，只要有統計與數字就完了。試想如果單憑貿易統計與數字就能理解日本，那不太簡單嗎？</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的眞義</p>
<p>一萬萬的日本國民，都確信這一次的大東亞戰爭是大東亞的解放戰，也就是皇國日本實　三千年的信念之戰爭。</p>
<p>這一點希望中國人都能明白。若對這一點認識不淸，那末對今後的大束亞事情，就難明瞭。緬甸的獨立，菲律賓的獨立，馬來人的參政，爪哇人的參政，援助印度獨立，實施對華新政策這一連串的事實，我敢斷定這都是大束亞戰爭就是大東亞民族解放戰爭的鐵證。</p>
<p>英美的努力戰爭，是不近人情的矛盾舉動；我相信世界上決沒有人把英美的對日戰爭當作大東亞解放戰。</p>
<p>友人敵人必須分明</p>
<p>所以，重慶與英美協力作戰，換言之就是妨碍印度的獨立，否認緬甸的獨立，欲將大東亞各民族置於英美荷蹂躪下。大東亞民族全體起來，為解放而戰的時候，祗有重慶政權，成了東亞的叛徒。這是不是重慶軍政界及民間有識者從信念上出發的意志呢，我相信它一定不是的。重慶拘泥舊事陳跡，感情用事，所以自尋苦悶。</p>
<p>以注主席為中心的國民政府，現在與日本共同作戰。他是大東亞解放戰的有力戰友，為了充分發揮新中國的戰力，所以政府與人民應如何協力復興國家，我想這些問題，中國的聰明人士都是充分明瞭的。（企靑譯）</p>
<h3>武昌起義　與官民合作路線</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>三十二年　的今天，即一九一一年十月十日，爆發的武昌起義，是和明治維新革命時的鳥羽伏見戰爭相等部是在世界史上具有極大的意義。二者全是由於歷史上的必然性，而不可避免地要爆發的革命。然而武昌起義的導火綫，却是偶然的一件奇事。這一天，在漢口俄國租界的同盟會支部裏，黨員們正在拼命地秘密製造炸彈。有一個黨員誤把炸彈掉到了地板上，所以炸彈便轟然一聲炸裂了。在這一個屋子裏的人，便慌慌張張地都逃得一幹二淨。因為過於慌張，甚至革命黨員的名冊，都忘記了帶走。如名冊落到警察手裏，那末當然全將被捕，送上斷頭台去。與其受死，莫如先發制人為愈，於是他們揭竿而起，發動軍隊　變。革命黨員把因兵變而嚇得魂不附體。在床底下顫抖地躱藏著的黎元洪拖出來，奉之為「大義發起人」，而强迫他發表革命宣言。這就是所謂「武昌起義」的歷史事實。然而一九一二年上海商務印　館出版的愛德文·丁哥　（Edwin　J．Dingle　著之一九一一年至一九一二年中國大革命（China's　Revolrtion　I9II-I9I2）一瞥中，關於黎元洪有如下的叙述：</p>
<p>（中國革命在世界史上，是最駭人聽聞的劃時代事件之中的一個。如果目前全世界無人不知無人不曉的黎元洪，當時不在的話，也許革命就不會爆發。歷史證明，只有黎元洪是中國世界上最偉大的改革家。由於他對國民所實行的健全政治與廉潔德行，使新的中國很迅速地跳上東四兩　的政治舞台。……他在如今全世界人士的眼光裏，被認作這一時代最有才能的唯一改革家。」（該　二十四頁）</p>
<p>縱令我承認黎元洪是武昌革命的一位指導者，但如肯定因兵變而驚慌失措，鑽入床底的他，為　中國在目前世界上最偉大的改革家」，那顯然是褻瀆了武昌起義的眞正意義。武昌起義，並非是黎元洪這樣舊時代的一介武夫所指導的，而是當時旣無名又無錢，只有滿腔愛國熱悄，希冀中國成為近代强國的這一　革命黨　所指導的，尤其是　坐在神田一帶公寓的一批留日學生所指導的。然而領導這羣指導者，且對武昌起義指示應走的方向者，這當然是孫中山先生。，口孫總理當時流亡國外，且武昌起義時未得「　入床底」的機會，便斷定他為武昌起義的局外人，具有這種見解者，甚至也不能不承認，指示武昌起義以淸晰的應走方向　　反對封建制度，反對帝國主義　　者，是孫總理。</p>
<p>中國革命的浪潮</p>
<p>自此以後，中國革命的浪潮無論怎樣起伏，但總不脫離反對封建制度，反對帝國主義的兩個路綫，這正如　的　，無論怎樣左右搖　，而總要囘到垂直　上。中國革命，一時無論企圖導入那一方向，但總會囘到這個中心任務上來。反對封建制度和反對帝國主義，一　以蔽之，就是中國爭取近代國家式的獨立自主。武昌起義以來的中華民國，在表而上是建立起來了近代國家，然而國家的獨立自主程度，仍然還不是完整無缺。因此，中國政治總是以獨立自主問題為中心，而在開展著；至於人民大衆的政治鬭爭，也總是把視錢　中於反對封建制度與反對帝國主義的目標上。所以對於中華民國，也可以說，政府與國民問的合作路綫，業已在歴史上決定了。政府如不而對著反帝反封建政策向前　進，而想取得人民大衆的合作，是等於綠水求魚。常政府採取危害國家主權及民族獨立的政策時，則人民拒絕與之合作。這種方向，現在也可以說，已經成為人民間牢不可破的中華民國革命原則之信念。</p>
<p>中國政治家以此種人民信念為中心，而進行政治國爭。懐有　意的政治家，常攻擊其政敵時，則　用此種人民信念。例如大事宣傳，某某人勾結異族帝國主義，出　中華民族利益，是老牌漢奸等。對於國家自主員族獨立，</p>
<p>轉入第四版</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>上接第三版具有極端敏感的人民，在某種程度上相信這種武斷宜傳，且出而反對這個人。仔細想一想，中國政治家中，會有幾人未被稱作漢奸的呢？甚至孫總理和三井洋行締結漢冶萍借款條約時，曾一度全國　然，疾為賣國賊。</p>
<p>國民政府成立意義</p>
<p>南京政府在其成立上，因受到日本的援助，當然受到許多物議，然而這一點決不要作杞人憂天的舉動。只要相信中華民族固有的政治本能，只要面對著國家的獨立自主方向，勇往直前地邁進，那就對天無愧。常然毫無疑問，中國的獨立自主，如無全國統一的形勢，即無全面和平的局面，是不能實現的。因此民衆對於全面和平間題，自然懐抱着莫大的關心。最近汪主席關於全面和平的聲明，正是囘答民衆的這種關心。民眾對於政府的這一個趨向，一定從心坎　說，願意合作。</p>
<p>此外，我堅決的相信，日本的對華政策只要尊重中華民族的獨立自主要求，縱令在現狀上無論碰到如何的障碍，但將來必定得到中國人的同情。然而千萬不要忘記，重慶方面經常在宜傳，「日本的對華政策，是給中國以名義，而自取實惠的」政策，用這種方法在刺激具有獨立自主敏感的一般民衆之自尊心。　是之故，正如在交通　產以及其他問題上。雖然業已交還南京政府，但假如實權仍有操路日人手中的現象者，這反來給重慶方面的宣傳提供資料。結果，中國民衆就對南京政府拒絕合作，所以對於道一點，有更加注意的必要。　時，日本決不要疏忽對南京政府合作，使之成為近代化國家的政府。例如對於人事間題，所在對建君主專制時代一樣，不按才能取捨，反用血族關係和幫派關係決定，如眞有這種現象，則應當由日本的協助而早日削除。還決不是一干渉內政　的問題。總而言之，只要日本不違背中國的革命原則，就可以不顧一切，努力實踐。</p>
<p>然而當實踐時，日本還應當再一度內省者，就是中國在近代化國家上的獨立自主，是否有　於日本發展的間題。假如日本本身始終不出狹義的國家主矓範圍一步，那末隣爾的强盛是要威脅本國的强盛的，所以所謂尊重中國的獨立自主，顯然是一種自欺欺人之談。對於中國人那樣具有敏感的政治本能之民族，實行政治謊言是不行的。大東亞戰爭以前的某些日本人中，曾有過狹義的國家主義，然而現在不能就說完全削除　。中國人之所以不信任日本人的話，其道理也就在於此。</p>
<p>亞洲民族衷心合作</p>
<p>然而大東亞戰爭開始以來，尤其是戰爭形勢愈演愈烈的今天，日本為了在大東亞戰爭中克敵制勝，就痛切地感到，非亞洲各民族衷心合作不可。但日本　始終斤斤於狹義的國家主義當中，那末就絕對不會　得亞洲各民族的衷心合作。日本為了對抗英美這樣版圖廣大的國家，則無論如何，也必須把整個亞洲組織成為一個版圖廣大的國家。民族主義業巳成為推動時代的動力之目前世界，跟成吉斯汗大帝的時代，根本不相同了。現在民族與民族間如無平等，則決不會同生共死地進行反對共同敵人的　爭。這種淺而易懂的理由，在中日關係上尤為明顯。如日本在中日關係上，能澈底實現這一思想，那末給亞洲各民族的政治影響，將非常重大。因為從中國在亞洲各民族間所佔的政治地位上看，如中華民族跟日本和解，且衷心跟日本合作，那末其他各民族，也會起而傚法中華民族的。這一點，尤其在印度民族問題上，更為明顯。不待言，印度民族是反對英國統治的，然而一直到今天還不能完全信賴日本駢肩作戰者，就是因為他們還朱看到日本不會成為第二個英國的充分證據。這因為中日事變尙未圓滿解決，而整個中華民族的態度尙未明朗所致。假如中華民族的大部份，肯對日本衷心合作的話，到印度立刻會改變其目前這種政治上的猶豫，而跟日本合作，由內外一齊夾攻，驅逐英美，　中國情願跟日本合作，那末印度一脫離貢國，則世界問題將由亞洲人來決定。從這一見地上看來，全亞洲問題的關鍵，不，全世界問題的關鍵，可以說，全係於這個中日關係處理上的成功於否上，這也許不算過甚之訽，然而為了處理中日關係，顯然，日本自身必須首先放棄狹　的國家觀念，而衷心喜悅中國的自由獨立。在這一點上，欺人或自欺，都沒有存在的餘地。近代化了的，和强盛起來的中國，業巳不再是日本的威脅，而是大東亞戰爭上的良好夥伴。此時由於對中國的「利權」思想，而把日本國家的興亡大問題　　糟了，這是不行的。——這就是日本　國民的新的覺醒。根據這種國民自覺而實行者，即是對華「新政策」這是不言而喩的事。</p>
<p>因此，日本的新政策完全符合中國的革命原則，其間不能有任何摩擦。同時，中國政府與人民間的合作路綫，日本與中國間的全作路綫，不　全亞洲民族的全作路綫，也都符合中國的革命原則以及日本的新政策。當然，最後的目的，是爭取亞洲各民族的獨立自主之　同鬥爭。</p>
<p>在歴史上對日本表示這一方面者，是明治維新的革命，對中國出現這一方向者，即是武昌革命，這一點是用不著多加辭費的吧！（漢譯）</p>
<h3>如何增加農工生產</h3>
<p>— 唐壽民</p>
<p>近年以來，物價飛騰，社會民生汪能安定，論者多歸咎於囤積者之壟斷居廳，誠然，囤積壟斷足以促致物價暴漲，其實還有一個更重要的原因，就是生產不足，治標辦法，固應吸收游資，取締囤積，提倡節約，均衡供求，治本辦法，還須積極促進生產，現在政府實行統制各項主要商品，進而逐漸實施，各項日用品配給制度，對於平抑物價方面，不久當可漸見效果，但假使物資供應來源不繼，配給辦法仍難持久，所以積極增加生產一事，還待社會各方一致努力。</p>
<p>吾國土地廣大，蘊藏豐富，人口衆多，氣候適中，生產條件至為優越。論理應無物資不足之現象。然而過去農工產品尙不免一部份仰給輸入者，其原由純由於產業界金融界以及技術家未能密接聯繋，通力合作所致。產業界缺乏可運用之資金，金融界有資金而不投入於生產用途，技術家則學成無致用之機會。今後最要之舉，當力矯過去錯誤，以金融界為中心，力謀三方面之密切合作，以復興民族經濟，完成生產自給自足，為共同之目標。同時更希望政府對於一切增產工作，均能予以獎勵扶持，則工作之進行，當可僡見迅速順利。</p>
<p>增加生產三個前題</p>
<p>中國工業之中心在上　，欲復興中國工業，增加工業產品，自當先從恢復上海之工業入手。事變以來，上海工業衰落，產量减少的原因。第一由於原料缺乏，第二由於動力限制，第三由於工人食糧發生問題，多數廠家因對於上列三點無法解決，於是或减工，或停工，馴至游資充斥，羣趨於投機囤積之一途，而失業一工人數字，亦遂不免日見龐大。此種現象，不但影響民生，並足以危害社會秩序安甯。現在政府厲行取締囤積投機行為，使一般游資，重返於生產用途，正是工業復興的一個大好機會，正宜羣策羣力，一致向增加生產之途邁進。有人一定要提出疑間，復興工業的三個的提尙未解決，工廠連恢復正常工作都不可能，增加生產從何談起。照我看來，祗要各方面認為增加生產是對於中國卯且對於整個東亞都是絕對必要的一件，那麼對於解決這三個前提問題，並非難事。</p>
<p>第一工業原料問題　過去原料缺乏，不一定是眞正缺乏，其中也不無一部份人為的關係，例如收買的辦法不恰適當，收買的價格太抑低，收買的機構不能取得當地農民的合作，這都是收買成績不　，原料缺乏的原因。自從日本施行對華新政策，取消日商組合獨占收買，並緩和各地物資流通限制以後，收購原料的成績，已日　進步，拿此次麥粉專業委員會統收小麥及上　各麺粉廠開工情形來說，豈非工業原料供給情形，已經顯見改善。倘使各業都能仿照麥粉業辦法，向金融業貨借大宗低利借款，向各主要產地統　購收，則原料供給問題，當亦不難次第解決。不過在收買時，關於方法和價格，還應該多加考慮，萬萬不可採取强制方式，使農民發生畏懼，那麼不但要影響到目前的收購，還要影響到未來的產量，如能利用農民重視實物心理，　可能範園以內，多多採用物物交換方法，則收購成績之圓滿更可預期</p>
<p>第二電力限制問題　上海方面各電廠之總發電量，約在二十萬KVA以上，此　廠間均早巳接通綫路，互相饋輸調節，以之供應上。全市日前用電需要，似尙不應發生不足之現象。以吾人所知，各工廠中因用電限度太低，無法開足全工者固多，但是原定限度太寬，現在用不足額或根本不用者，亦不在少，此種現象，亟應加以糾正調整，使眞正有意生產之工業，得以盡量發展。假使經過此番調整以後，工業用電仍感不　，那麼還可以嚴格限制一般消耗用途的重量來　注工業用電，再不然，也可以停止一部份與民生無關工業的配電來積極補助民生工業的不足、這件事應　由地方行政當局，工業團體，電力公司三方面曾同決　一　原則，再根據原則逐漸實行，如此則上海工業動力問題，似亦不難解決。</p>
<p>第三工人食糧問題　工人是生產份子，要增加生產，必須先顧到工人生活，尤其是嗣後採辦工業原料大部份須用物物交換方式，對於工業品的增產，不能不加倍　力，即對於工人生活問題，不能不格外先謀解決，我個人主張在普通配給之外，從事民生工業的工人，應該特別配給，假使糧食來源充足的話，特別配給，當然不成問題，要不然，就應該疏散一部份無業游民，把省下的糧食來作特別配給用途，決不可意存姑息，使分利者與生利者享受同等待遇。</p>
<p>以上係個人對於工業增產的意見。至如農業增產，則較工業更覺重要，第一民　問題急待解決，第二是一切工業，非有原料不能活動，中國原本是一個農業國家，人口百分之八十以上是從事農業的，拿土地而積農民數量來說，至少應該能自給自足，然而現在寬　成民食和原料不足的現象　這實在是中國每一個國民莫大的恥辱，要渝　此種恥辱，必須在最短期內做到自給自足的地　。無論經過此次世界大戰以後，各國一時決無輸出餘力，就是仍可輸出，始終倚賴他人，究非立國之　，我們現在應該盡刀　討過去　產不足的理由，然後從而一一補救。</p>
<p>改良農業技術問題</p>
<p>根據專家的意見，吾國農產不足的原因：　由於水利不修修，一過水旱，立成災　。　由於耕作方法不知研究，以致產量逐年遞减。　由於種籽不知改良，以致品質日趨惡劣，並且影饗生產。　由於虫災不知注意防止，以致每年損失重大。　由於荒山廢地湖沼澤田不知利用，以致利棄於地，不過有人以為上列各項問題都屬次要，最主要的還須政治淸明，社會秩序安定，能使農民安居樂業，然後綫可以談到恢復正當生產，更然後綫可以漲到增加生產，我們現在姑置政治問題不論，專談農業技術問題，深覺下列各項問題，均有立加研討之必要。</p>
<p>農田水利問題江南各地，稻為主要產品，江北以及蘇淮等處，則棉麥實佔大宗，前者須要灌漑，後者須要抖水，即應因地制宜或設置戽水站以利灌溉，或疏浚河流以利排洩，事變前建設委員會利用戚　　電力，在蘇常以帶通設灌溉站，農民　受實患，近年工資愈昻，農民需，電力灌溉愈感迫切，前項灌漑站之設置，亟有早日恢復並加擴充之必要，至　江北浚河工程，　江蘇省府亦辦理不遺餘力，尤應繼續舉辦，以免前功盡棄。</p>
<p>改良耕作問題耕作方面之應行改良者，共有三點，（一）改良耕作方式，（二）廢止舊式農具，改用新式農具，（三）研究施肥方法。吾國農民，但知墨守成法，非特心理乍難轉變，而且農村十九經濟衰落，　集一筆改良資金，亦非易事，故宜由主管機關，在各縣多設模範農塲，隨時啓示，並由余融機關舉辦農具及購買肥料等貸款，俾　農民曉然於改良耕作之利益，並得利用貸款實行改良。</p>
<p>改良種籽問題改良種籽，不但可以提高產品之質，並可以增加產品產量，例如棉花小麥兩項，巳均以推廣改良種籽，獲有相當效果，並得農民信仰，惜事變以後，此項研究推廣工作中　，以致　良種籽，無從取給，亟應由全管機關羅致專家，繼續研究，推廣。除棉麥稻作以外，其他有關民生之農產品，亦應擴大硏究。此外更宜獎勵資助人民，多設農塲，從事改良研究，俾改良種籽之供給愈可普遍。</p>
<p>防止虫災問題虫災問題在吾國極為普遍，如螟災之於稻作，黑穗病之於麥作，其為害之烈，正不下於水災，旱荒，且水災　荒並非常有，而虫災則無年無之，金陵大學農業刊物中會估計吾國虫災之捐失，年達二三萬萬元以上，其影響於民富之鉅，概可想見。現值積極提倡增加農產之際，積極方面如灌溉排水改良耕作種籽方面，固應特別注意，但消極方面之防止虫災方面，亦覺不　備廢，　則虫災蔓延愈廣，消　　難。防止方法，一而應恢復昆虫局一類機關，繼續硏究預防及消滅辦法，一面更宜提倡大量製造除虫藥劑，以低價普遍供給農民。</p>
<p>利用荒地問題　吾國荒山廢地湖沼澤田，所在多有，苟能因地制宜，充分利用，於增加農產方面，亦可裨益非淺，惟吾國人民性情，多樂與觀成，難與謀始，而壟榷工作，又非　嗟　可獲近利，故宜由政府設立機關，自行辦理，或獎勵人民組織公司辦理，而由政府千以利息上之保障，以及工作上之種種便利。</p>
<p>增產資金如何籌集</p>
<p>關於農工增產所需要之資金，將以何法籌集，亦為本文中應先討論之問題。　意工業資金，除長期者應先充實各個資本或發行公司債外，其期限較短性質活動者，上海各商業銀行皆樂於承做，且目前銀根漸鬆，似巳不成問題，萬一統　收購原料，需要鉅額資金時，亦可仿照　業借款粉麥借款前例，由金融界組織銀關，共同承放，而中　銀行以國家銀行地位，為之後盾。至若農業放款，性質不　工商業放款之靈活，且又散在各地，根本不甚為一般商業銀行所歡迎，尤其中期長期貸款，期限較長，更非一般商業銀行能願做所能做。但是農業之需要改良資金，實較工業更感迫切，同時農業生產，旣與民食攸關，又與工業生產有聯帶之關係，因為無農產即無原料、無原料則工業即無法生產。在加此情形之下，籌集資金的方法，唯有兩途，第一由國家銀行自行辦理，或由國家銀行供給資金，委託其他銀行辦理，第二鼓勵一般商業銀行辦理，由國家銀行保障利息，並於必要時予以隨時轉抵押之便利，無論採用何種方式，對於農村金融機構如合作社等，必須先行健全樹立，否則組織散漫，簡直無從著手。</p>
<p>最後還有一點，就是要求國內農業工業專家出其所學，對於民族復興經濟建設的工作，一致參加，最低限度，要能於最短期內，做到自給自足的地步，怎樣纔可以完成這種使命，全仗各方共同努力</p>
<h3>促進生產建設</h3>
<p>— 許冠羣</p>
<p>時至今日，人人似已懁然覺悟於投機以圖暴利之不可恃，努力以求生產之為不容緩。申報為適應時代與環境之要求，於中華民國三十二年國慶紀念之日，以「如何增加農生生產　一題，徴文於余，自維淺陋，深慮不能言之有物，姑就個人觀感所及，簡略抒其管見。</p>
<p>吾人皆知中國欲求自力更生，則中國在經濟建造方面，應有急角度之轉變，就是要由消費國家的地位，一變而為生產國家的地位。已　之中國經濟特質，即中國祗能消費，不能生產，至令中國號稱為世界最大消費的國家，言之痛心。無論為承平時代，抑為戰爭時代，未有專知消費而不務生產之國家，能夠生存於今日之衰宇者。差幸今日經濟界有識之士，無不深明此義，一致倡言增加生產，藉以矯正過夫不事生產之錯誤，自為一種良好的現象。</p>
<p>可是，不言生產則已，否則對於如何增加生產一個問題，必須先為窮本探原之商榷與建議。此次申報國就徴文題目所昭示的，就是今日中國生產的基本問題，在於如何利用中國最大的兩項資本與富源——人力與土地。所以，題為「如何增加農工生產。</p>
<p>對於農工問題的認識</p>
<p>說到農工生產，其重點不在於理論，而在於事實。自經濟理論而言，處於今日的時代，重農學派與重商學派問的一道鴻溝，早已不復存在，換一句話說，農工生產，是並重的，中古之時，農業之優勢甚盛，十七世紀之秋，　業之權衡日增，迨至十八世紀中葉，農業復　重於世，及工業革命興起，工業遂又超乎各業之上，於是忽而重農，忽而重工。可是，今日經濟界對於農工問題的認識是有些不同了，我們的共同認識是：農工生產的重要性，是無分軒輊的，因為工商兩界必須購其原料品於農夫，同時，農夫亦須購其器具及他類製造品於工商兩界。所以，農業增　，即可以增加工業生產，而工業增　，亦即可以增加農業生產。</p>
<p>可是，以中國之農業生產現狀而論，正如林康　先生在本年九月號「經濟導報」中所寫的一段　以現狀而論，人力與土地之兩大生產要素，在我國似無問題，若詳加硏究，則亦危機四伏，不禁為之蹙然而憂，蓋自物價激漲，黑市塲叢生以來，黑交易之利益，遠超一般正當之企業收益率，並視一般工資薪給收入為優。自黑市米價高漲以來，鄕村農民不論少　婦孺，均拋鋤離田，終日肩挑背負，奔走於城鄕途中，販運米糧，追求走私米之暴利，其影響於農業生產者，不言可喻。又如黑市烟價　漲以來，烟紙店前長隊人羣，終日擁擠，　取配給烟以販　於黑市，此項收入，又遠較普通工資為鉅，此種現象，不僅浪費人力，抑且影響勞工心理，使之厭棄生產工作，而樂營販運走私之業，則增產時之人力間題與工資問題，豈可無憂　」</p>
<p>鑒於這樣一般的危機與現象，我對於如何增加農　生產，覺得有幾個關鍵問題，是需要我們經濟界人士北同　進的，茲為申述如左：</p>
<p>關於增加農業生產方面者：</p>
<p>農業金　問題：增加農業生產，最有賴於農業金融之調劑，交通銀行舉辦之　村貸款，即為調　農業金融之　伴榜樣，因其農業金融業務方針是國　改善農村經濟狀況，　增加農業生產量，並協助農業推進與推廣，　輔導農　樹立自有，自營，自享之金融制度與金融機構，　扶被樹立自耕農，我完全同　於　幾個方針並且以為投　農村放款，實宜擴大推行，而其初步工作，應先著重於農村信用及生產合作放欵，　農村之首金，得以周轉，使　　的農村　濟狀况，日有起色，則農業生產，自然增加。</p>
<p>農業技術問題，增加農業生產，更有賴於農業技術之改進。我國土地非不肥沃，出產非不富饒，祗惜耕種方法，素來墨守成規，不圖改進，而機器耕種方法，至今猶付缺如，坐使生產之量，不能突飛猛　。此外，對於荒田荒地之如何開墾，長扛　沼地帶之如何開發，據硏究所得，東太湖　墾計劃完成後，可得良田一萬六千公頃，可收食米七千萬担。均為農業技術問題，影響於農業生產　者至互。</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>上接第四版</p>
<p>產　物　　問題：增加農業生產，復　頓於農產物價格之提高。農民償琮債務之　一能力，即為　農產物。如國家收買農產物時，將其價格抑低，　農民喪失償還之能力，其結果非難無心料　，甚且棄而之他。如將農產物價格，衡情予以提高，則宵民收入可以增加，除去最低限度之生活費外，得以其剩餘金錢，投放於土地，使　地之租放耕種，漸　於節約化，於是農產物亦自可以增加。</p>
<p>關於增加工業生產方面者：</p>
<p>工業原料問題：「巧婦難為無米之炊」是中國一句老話，也是最合邏輯的一句老話。工業的血液，即為原料。今日工業生產不振的許許多多原因常中，自以原料缺乏或枯竭為其致命之打擎。由於　　　運的困難或　絕，對於　入的原料，自然　生　　，但有可能　　　內，仍當竭力使其源源接濟。此外，應　盡最使用土　原料為第一原則。誠然，我們對於　粉的生產，不　沒有小麥，紗布的生產，毋慮沒有棉花，但是一切其他工業產品，也不是沒有上產原料，可資　　使用的，例如酒精的原料為山要與甘蔗，紙的原料為木與竹，　為　　七產中所富有的。問題祇在於如何盡量使用它們？其屬於配給者。加何去盡量配給它們？</p>
<p>工業金融問題：改善金融活動與增加生產力　，　　至為密切。前年夏季，我與朱　泉，項康原，藝聲白諸先生，討論國內工業金融問題，深感國內金融環境，未能適應工業界之需求，其後遂有中國工業銀行之創辦，其　的即在於使正當生產事　　　　運之資金，護得合理之　劑，同時，　工業界有一切合增加生　　實之　　機構，　理工業方面之調査，統計，研究，設計，技術，等事項，藉為工業生產努力。此外，鑒於小　工業在中國整個的生產量上，還是佔著重要地位，所以，我也是極力贊同組織。小工業的勃興，是在增加生產綫上的一個「集腋成裘」辦法。因此，工業金融調劑之中，尤有振與小工業之必要。</p>
<p>總而言之，在我們一致耍求增加農工生產的旗幟下，人民無論為農為工而生產者，都應一掃過去吃慣用憒之陋習，共同把握如何增加農工生產之　建，努力於其本位之工作，則四萬萬原來大半為消費者，不難　　為四萬萬生產之國民。中國經濟，必須有此急角度的專變，方足以言新中國之產生。</p>
<h3>增加農工生產　努力本位工作</h3>
<p>— 邵樹華</p>
<p>言緒</p>
<p>我國為一農業生產國家，輕重工業迄今猶在萌芽時期，人民大都以農業為生估計全國人口四萬五千萬中約有三萬萬為農民佔全國總人口百分之七十五，由是知我國生產專業之偏重於農業甚為明顯，故欲求吾國經濟事業之發展，宜先自農業始，農業生產之增加，間接使全國之經濟得以發展也。同顧我國之工業，在十九世紀初葉前，仍為一手製工業國，自鴉片戰爭後，中國之閉關自守主權，被槍砲破　以后，由於外人之投資機器不斷運來，於是我國幼稚之工業，方且雛型。戰亂以來，我國工業损毀鉅大，雖　國人之不斷努力，對於機器之運營與工業之　進，質量亦多改進，但我國工業前途之發展，尙待極大之努力也。</p>
<p>土地租用之限制</p>
<p>在簡討如何增加農業生產之　，吾人必先認淸農業之生產究以何者為對象？農業之生產當以農地為共對象，乃衆所共知，之事實也，今姑先以農地加以中述，據張心一氏佔計　地　面積為二，入五七，〇〇〇畝哩，約合一二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇畝，中巳耕之地約有一，二四　，〇○〇，〇〇〇畝，僅佔總面積十，三。但據土地委員會報告耕地面積，佔調査面積百分之二二，三四，二者相差一倍以上，今姑置不論，僅就吾面觀之，亦可見耕地面積之少矣。然同一農地，尙有耕地面積　作物面積之別，前者乃天然乙面積，後者為生產之面積　　　　農業生產增加，必先使作物　積增加，然而　於土地之利用，亦有　限　，軌可耕地而言，已有　　之限制，與相對之限制，換言之即，自然之限制，　人物之限制，吾人欲使農業增加，必需　　上流之限制　　消　，然的　可　生產量之增加，所謂自然之限制，有下列四因素：</p>
<p>，　　　影響　物之生產，例如溫　之高低，可左右作物之成熟，又　　之生產，每與存分　霜降　間之　　成正比例、凡此　種，均是以　　作物之生產。</p>
<p>，植物之生長，不但需要雨量豐富，而且需要時間上之分佈均勻，有雨量甚大之地，因水　分配之不同，半年為晴，半年為雨，致不能充分利用其土地者，均足為農業生產之障礙。</p>
<p>地形，指地面之形狀而言，如傾斜度及其傾斜方向，土地之平坦或凸凹等　之平原，對農作物最為有利，在農業機械化之今日，平原之價値更形增加，惟有其他障礙，縱有不傾斜之地，則亦影響生產不少。</p>
<p>土壤，土壤有直接由岩石分佈而成者曰　積上，有由流水泥沙聚積而成者曰運積土，其分解程度　　者為佳，惟有大部結構甚鬆之砂土，與結構過密之牯土，均不宜於耕　也。</p>
<p>至於人為之限制，以中國為例：中國之經濟尙處於半對建狀態，往往因封建　　勢力之存在，每使　地之利用與荒地之　問　受阻碍，例如我國各地　　富賈之填　，佔地極廣，且均為優良之地，如此佔有數千頃良田，有碍於土地耕種，影響　　，同時我國小　制之沿　　今，亦間接妨碍　　機械化之　　。</p>
<p>凡此種咱，均足以　上地之利用不能充分，　足而　　　　之增加，必　設　以土地可用之　制，加以消除，亦即使土地增加（　耕性），如此　　生產，可因　　　給之「固定性」之改變，而形增加。</p>
<p>農業生產必要條件</p>
<p>農業生產既受制於土地利用之限制而土地之利用又每受制於　食生產之限度，則　農業生產量之增加亦須謀糧食產量之增加，考增加農業生產之必要條件，有下列數方面：</p>
<p>耕加之擴展，在歴史久還之國家，耕地擴展，未必能增加每入之糧食生產量，蓋人口增加之結果，交使耕種機展至更劣等之土地，故每人生產量或可能因之而反形减少。然近世新大陸之開發，巳有不少，此等土地，皆可利用之作為耕地，　因未經耕植，故較之耕種數千百年之土地為肥沃，故此種耕地必使其盡量擴展，則　食生產有增加之可能，最近四十六年來世界小麥耕地　增加百分之六十九，每年平均增加百分之一·五，即其明　。</p>
<p>生物學之進步　農業上有關　種與病蟲之　治等方法，皆有　於生物學之研究，近代生物學之進步，有助於上述　事。其功實不可滅耕地之擴張，如無　種，以滴　　增土地之氣侯　需要，則　不能有良好之成　，生物學之進步，對於治蟲方面　　良多，不特文明國家害蟲大減，即如埃及之　　及蝗蟲亦大為　少。而牲畜之飼養，亦因　種技術之改　而　　與品質均大有增加，是以生物學之進步，足以推進農產之增加，彰彰明甚。</p>
<p>化學之積發達，化學這發達，可使糧食生產，加工及消費各方面大見改進，其最有助於產量之增加者，成為人造肥料之運用，近如友邦日本每畝收穫量增加無巳，其與肥料儘管進之關係甚钜。至於　　加工之改進，使以前　棄之食物或竟成為營養上所必須之食料，故化學技術之改進，當能使糧食產量增加也。</p>
<p>農業之機械化，機械之被採用於農業，不啻為農業生產史上開新紀元，工業革命後各國農業　　而於機械化之途，耕作器具均用機器以代人力，由是生產量大增，惜我　宵　之生產技術，今猶處於封建氣氛中，一切墨守舊章鐮，　，犁鋤之　用，更普見於各農村，其與機械化之生產技術較實有天壤之別，由此而欲產量之增加也難矣，然吾人既明瞭上述坩產之先決條件，吾人即可從此某本　　發，力謀改善如能符合工述條件，則農業生產量之增加可期焉。</p>
<p>戰後上海工業情形</p>
<p>上海為我國新式工業之中心，故當我國工業可以上海等代表，八一三　戰以後上海工業所受之毀壞極為　大，元氣大偶。根據社會局調查，事變前滬市登記之工廠為五，二五五家，事變後毀損者達四，九九八家　佔百分之九十五之多，就中紡織廠戰則上海共六十五家，事變後僅剩十餘家，　絲廠　前上海共四十四家，事變後僅剩十餘家，　粉廠戰前上海共十四家事變後毀損亦達半數，其他各工業廠家之損失，亦莫不钜大。</p>
<p>自民國二下七年以的，各廠雖紛紛恢復，且有新式工廠之開工，三數年來上海之工業頗呈蓬勃之氣象，惟自三十年後世界戰局擴大，上海工廠之原料燃料來源缺乏，出品之產　多受限制，工業界頓覺困難重重，致造成三十一年之工業處於袁落，本年以還，雖有各方面之努力，亟　增進工業生產，但因原料動力遝銷等困難之難獲澈底解決，而尙　相常成效，是以復興工業，增加生產，為當前經濟建設中之最基本工作。</p>
<p>工業增產必要步骤</p>
<p>現階段上海之工業，既有上述之種種困難、欲增加生產自非對目前工業所以衰落之原因，圖謀補　不可　者以為現時之工業生產，若能恢復　事　前之狀態，暫時已可相當　意，故本節所編增加工業生產之　　，乃　解決當　之阻碍問題為　　，　以管　所及，略　如次：</p>
<p>疏通原料來源　原料為生產命脈，增加　　　須　原料　　　　　，　目前各種　　原料，　　戰　物　之統　，致交流不及從前　　　，　　物資。固為　　國家所必行者，但對正當工業生產所需之原料品，　　　　以交流及運銷之便利，並從事原料品生產之增加，則工業生產之增加可期也。</p>
<p>改善　力供給　自戰事發生以來，上海電力公司以煤斤之來源困難，不得巳曾實行電力供給之限制，自三十年三月起累經縮小用電量，對於工業生產影響至為重大。但觀一九四二年上海產業指數約為一九三六年之百分之五十，可見工業界所受之打擎，吾人雖不能謂一九四二年工業之衰凋，　係由於用電之受限制，但電力供給之不足，不失為重大原因，今後如欲增加工業生產，自非按妥善計劃疏通煤斤來源，合理供給工廠用電不可。</p>
<p>訂定合理之工業品限價政府統制物價，規定限價，乃戰時必要之舉措，其於穩定的價安定民生，自不待　，然限價過高固見影響民生，而限價過低，則工業生產者之合法利潤不能獲得，亦失公允，故裕增加生產之過程中，對於限價之　定，不可不愼重考慮，應計算其成本，供求等各種情形，而決定之。</p>
<p>以上所陳諸端，為其最要者，他如工業資企之供給，政府之適當獎勵等，皆為生產增加之必要工作。</p>
<p>結語</p>
<p>我國為一積弱之國，百餘年來所受變　之影響不可謂不大，有識之士，莫不一心謀求國家之富强，但欲强必先富，欲富必先增加生產，而當前之增加生產，尤以農工為要，足以增加農工生產，實目前我國經濟建設上最重要之工作，國人各就本位而　努力之。</p>
<h3>增加農工生產之道</h3>
<p>— 百驥</p>
<p>吾國以農立國，數千年來，傳襲未更，社會經濟之基礎，仍以農業為本，頻年來，屢受戰事影響，生產率巳漸趨低落、而工業建設又向所落後，未能躋身於先進國間，與時並進，晚近輕重工業雖突飛猛普，進步殊速，然各項生產，猶未能盡如人意，且因戰時軍事工業之勃興致一般生產，間接減少，故增加農工生產，為目前吾國經濟建設當務之亟，不容忽視者也。</p>
<p>農業增產之認識</p>
<p>吾國地大物博，雄據亞洲東部，全面積百三十萬方英里，人日四風五千餘萬，沃野千里，為一歷史性之農業國家，人國農民佔總人口四分之三，由此事實觀之，中國之經濟問題，其重心偏向於農村經濟，實無疑惑，吾人欲研討如何增加生產，必先從農業着手。</p>
<p>關於農業生產之最主要者，莫過於糧食，中國糧食作物佔總作物畝數在百分之八十以上，承平之世，國際貿易，暢行無阻，一國只須有足夠之交換品，即不愁糧食之供給，一國之糧食供給，似不必偏重於國內之生產，然自國防上言，則糧食資源即不得不偏重於國內之生產，而在無强大軍事力最足以維持國外交過之國家，其糧食之自給，更形重要。而中國之農業生產又因其經濟結構之特殊，即在平時，亦宜自給自足，否則影響國民經濟之前途，至舉危懼。中國人民，依農業為生者，約十之七八，彼等之購買力，即出自農產品，而宵產品之大部為糧食，在僅有小　制　　國，　生產每以自給為主，有餘始出以交換，故各糧食不能自給，即無剩　之購買力，即使欲購　不足之　食，尙為不可，　論其他。是以糧食生產之不能自給，對　國　業生產經濟，　屬一嚴重之問題。</p>
<p>農業增產的困難</p>
<p>吾國農業增產之困難性何在：</p>
<p>無大農塲之建立。我國農塲，星棋雜布，阡陌縱橫，相互間隔，每一農戶所耕之田，均東分西散，不能集中於一　，屢由於抵押，出售，分產等種種原因，致使耕田面積，愈分愈小，此種碎耕制之弊端，有如下述：</p>
<p>土地之虛耗—不少土地，耗費於阡陌與田徑，减少生產面積。</p>
<p>勞動時間之耗費—農戶東奔西走，虛費勞力。</p>
<p>灌溉之阻礙—離開水源較遠之田，不得不假道他人之田，以便灌溉，於是糾紛時起，頻增騷擾，尤以旱年為甚。</p>
<p>機械之不能利用—在面積極小之耕田上，欲應用近代機械化之農具，有英雄無用武之地之感。</p>
<p>選擇品種之盲目　—大多農戶均　祖先遺傳之甯騐，盲目選育其品種，全無科學上之依據與改良，此欲求生產之增加也難矣。</p>
<p>簡單農具之　用—所有農具，如鋤，犂，　，水　，水車，風畫，石磨等簡單　　之工具，迄今依然未廢，且尙為普遍應用，與機械之效率較，相去不可以道里計也。</p>
<p>培養　溉經濟之技術—我國天然河流甚多，故水利事業亦　為人所注意。較大之河流，一方面問為灌溉最佳之水原，然另一方而尙須防水災之　　，故對於水利事業之發展，積極者為灌溉，亦即增加農業之生產，消極者為防災，亦即减少　產損害之可能性，然直至今日終尙有各種腐敗之因素，致使水利　　　收不堪，實深浩浩歎。</p>
<p>增加農產之方策</p>
<p>實施增加農業生產之方策如下：</p>
<p>望　荒廢土地—目下吾國土地有因戰事而荒蕪，有向未開闊者，此等荒廢土地，正大可利用開墾之，以符增產目的，但吾國農地之應用，因封建殘餘之存在，與官僚地主之剝削，當限礙荒地之開墾，蓋農民問墾一畝非其所有之土地，其收付除償付勞力成本外，尙須付苛捐，雜稅及租金，農民除非能負以上一切費用，即無開墾可能，且吾國雖領土甚廣，但多數荒地均不適於耕種，我國荒地面積佔全國土　面積亦僅百分之十九·一，而可耕之荒地僅祇百分之六·四而巳。再全國耕地一方雖可因開闊荒地而增加，一方又因水　　災而荒蕪，於是實際上荒地之增加，亦祗百分之一，故荒地雖可開墾，然亦有限，我國農產之增加，亦非僅開墾荒地所可解決者也。</p>
<p>新式農具及機械之應用—新式農具及機械之應用於耕種，當可節省勞力，策進增產，按美國農部報吿，中國農民一人可耕作一至四英畝，而美國一農人可超越五七英畝，中國農戶平均祗能耕稻田二英畝，美國則可耕二百至四百英畝，美國生產一公畝之棉花，所需之人工共計二八九小時，而中國需一六二〇小時，由此觀之，中國田地每畝之生產量。即或有時多於美國，然因所需人工過多，生產效率之低於美國，乃為無庸　言之事實。</p>
<p>改進穀物品種—對於優良之種籽，需積極加以推廣，母專默守成規，養成盲目性之選擇品種習慣，對於土壤之分析，品種之選育等種種科學上智識，　積極灌　於蔑民，則收獲自　。</p>
<p>培養農業專門人材—為欲達到推廣蔑民敎育及灌溉科學知識以利生產之目的起見，遂須坎養學騐且富之專門農業人材，俾農民之耕作方法與日俱進，而生產之坩可期也。</p>
<p>大農塲之開闊—開闊大農塲，為增加生產之實際　策。前已述及中國農塲均為券星碎小之農田，阡陌縱楛，均非集中，因此阻礙大規模之生產，今設　一有組織之大農塲，加以科學化之管理，則　　諸種困難，均可迎刃而解，　如土地之耗廢，可因之而减少。　阡陌田徑，均可加入耕種。農自之耕種亦因集中而减少終動或運　上所耗之勞動時問，而灌溉之紛爭及機械不能應用，皆可因之加以消除。</p>
<p>他如厲行　作　度，提倡勞働服務及開發都市農村等均為策進生產之　，可視事實需要，隨時加以推行。</p>
<p>工業增產之認識</p>
<p>我國工業生產，極其洛後，過去經營工業者，多　利原而風險小老為目標，至於其產品之於國於民有無實際　　，則鮮加顧問，試觀上海每一新與事業之始創，效尤者即如雨後春筍，　　鉅利而根本不考慮其性質，功效及需要程度，此種觀念之錯誤，自極明顯，我常戰時，一切當以供戰時需要為惟一目的，工業生產既負有完遂戰爭任務之重大寄托，自不能不一改過去目標，進而致力於目前必須品之生產，按工樂品之種煩繁多，考其彖極效用，除極少數例外者外，　莫不有關於國防民生，但下列數項為其尤重要者：</p>
<p>國防工業　包括一切戰具武器等之生產。</p>
<p>電氣工業　包括一切電工器材，電器機器工具等。</p>
<p>機器工業　包括一切馬逹引擎及其附屬品。</p>
<p>化學工業　包括一切藥品酒精酸鹼等。</p>
<p>紡絹工業　包括一切棉絲　毛及其製成品。</p>
<p>農產製造工業　包括一切食糧，植物油，茶糖等。</p>
<p>採礦冶鐵工業　包括一切金屬及非金屬礦物如金銀鋼銻錫鋁及其　炭煤油汽等之開採及冶製。</p>
<p>其他各種生活必需品工業　如革，紙，水泥，火柴，橡膠玻璃等工業。</p>
<p>目前增加工業生產，應以上列各主要必需工業為目標，務使以國防與民生二大需要為前提，而放棄以營利為惟一目的之自私觀念也，猶有　者戰時企業所得之逐漸識低為不可避免之現象。</p>
<p>考其　　率減少之原因，歸納為下列六點：　產品價格受限制。　工資增高支出劇增。　勞動福利事業費用增加。　新建築及擴充費用　貴，　捐稅之增加。　折舊準備之增多。由此可見戰時企業之經　，欲一味追求營利亦為事實上所不許，因此當　時機，全榮家惟有認濟目標，以民族國家之整個福利為重，而後事生產之增加方能　國民富强，使經濟建設逐步完成也。</p>
<p>工業增產途徑</p>
<p>增加工業生產既為當　所必需，　　法為：</p>
<p>融　工業資金　新式工業　　浩大，所需資金自極鉅大，且工業投資多屬時期較長，非一般短期信用機　（商業銀行）</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>上接第五版所克供應，故工業資金之獲得與調劑，實為增加生產之重要問題此問題之解決端賴一，金融資本經濟業資本之溝通。金融機關為黃金之中心市塲工業所需大量資金之獲得，非有賴於金融　之投放不可，而自金融業者，目前多種交易均受限制，資金之　用亦感困難，　　而比較長期之工業投資，不失為一資金運用之良途，是以促造金融資本，與工業資本之合作現　通，實為增加生產所必需。二，由政府直接貸款或予　助。工業興衰有關國家至鉅，大規模企業影響尤為深　。是以對於一般必需工業，政政府願盡可能予以補助，或以種種協助貸與款項，以利生產之增進。</p>
<p>供給充分之工業原料工業之任務為化原料為製成品，必先有原料而後有出品，原料之供給不充，欲求生產之增進實不可能，現時工業原料，因外洋中斷，本國之供給缺乏，其後取甚為困難，欲增加工業生”。除增進原　品之出產，並疏通其　源外，妥善之分配亦　　要，最合理者莫如由同業公會等機構，調查各　實際需用量，然後各按所需比例分配，務使公平　量，以利生產並消　原料之黑市也，又　世科學昌明。戰時各國因原料之缺乏，而代之以代替品者，亦不乏其例，此　自宜加以提倡，至少可解決原料問題之一部分。</p>
<p>供給充分之工業動力　工業生產不能缺少滴當之動力，動力之供給除完全利　天然水力者外以電氣為最主，而電力之產生需煤或汽油等燃料，現常戰時為節省燃料起見乃有電力供給之限制，上　各工廠亦　受用電之限制，但限制用電直接影響於工業生產故應以重從事，如純屬消耗方面之用電應加限制，而由當工業之需用，為　戰時生產之增加，不但不應減低，似應加多供給，至少亦宜調查其實際需要，兗分供給之，同時電廠為公用事業本質上原與營利事業不問，而於戰時所　使命尤為重大，故止當生產事榮所用之電力，亦應盡量以低　之價格微取其電費，所以减輕生產成本鼓勵生產之增加也。</p>
<p>調劑出品之運銷出產品之運銷為工業發展之重要問題，開發交通改善交通，以便產品之運輸尤為迫切之問題，試觀現時一般交通運輪之困難，倘專事增多生產，則钜量之出品無法運銷流通，對於民生亦鮮有多大帮助，故運輸路線之疏通，運價之低訂皆促進運銷所必需，至於政府之課　　不妨碍稅收之原則下應盡最减免以為獎勵，又在統制經濟之下，商品　由政府加以限價，限價之　定，　應　表其低，以利民生，但亦應　　調濟其生　成本等各項情形，使在另一　簡潔不攝　生產者之正當利益，此亦增加生產聲中所不可忽視者，蓋不如是　失增加生產之原動力，欲求生產之增進難矣。</p>
<p>改進工業技術現代工業日新月異，在不斷之進步中，而此種進步非有賴於工業技術之研究與改良不為功，欲增進生產，工業上之技術尤不可不隨時改進，以使生產之技術及配備適合巨衆生產之應用，是以培養技術人才，創立研究機關，宣揚工業技術，皆增加生產中之要圖。</p>
<h3>增加農工生產檢討</h3>
<p>— 李嘉音</p>
<p>1．如何增加農業生產</p>
<p>吾國自古以農立國，歷代沿之弗替，　自神　敎民　穡，周創井制，以迄今茲，四千餘年。國人百分之八十，務農為生。査吾國農業之衰退，非自今日始，在淸之末葉巳露微象，洋米麥之輪入日增。茶絲雜類等農產品之輪出日減。迨民國以還，其衰退進程，更　迅速驚人，其中尤以糧食之短絀，最為嚴重。據最近三十年來海關貿易報告，每年輸入之　產物中，以米居第一，麥居第二，然以上二者為中國主要糧食，合占令國民金百分之四十五强，其電要性，概可想　矣。</p>
<p>吾國家藝哀頽之原因殊多，惟略舉其較切要者於后，作為今後謀增產者之參者：（甲）政冶不安定，（乙）天炎與水利失修；（丙）未盡地利，地政欠等；（丁）資本缺乏，農村金融周轉未臻靈活；（戊）運輸不便；（已）生產技術落後（句括土壤·肥料·種籽·病蟲·栽培方法等）；（庚）農具陳舊，耕牛不足。</p>
<p>農業增產問題，除糧食·棉花·雜糧等曲需品外，吾國之農業特產如桐油·茶·絲及與輕工業有關之農產原料之增進。亦不可忽視。現國民政府有　於戰時糧食之重要，曾　戰時經濟政策納，訂定糧食增產方案。擘劃周詳，惜鮮見其實施耳。</p>
<p>於今增加農產，　就管見所及，分治標與治本二　：</p>
<p>甲·治標的方法</p>
<p>治方面　民國以來，內亂外患，頻年不息，以致農村破產，民不得安居，　能樂業增產？且因政治不安定，其他經濟，社會及農業改進之設施，均不克湊效，故四者須相輔而行，始克有濟。政治之　要工作在弭亂安民。肅清匪患，朝野通力合作。同甘共苦，執政者須「先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂」，此理至明，無需贅述。</p>
<p>經濟方面　使務農者獲得相常之代價，减除「耕無所衣食」之危。據中國經濟研究會三十二年七月份，上海市浦東區農作物成本初步估計報告：一査訪地點凡三十四處，就農產品之種類言，僅以棉·麥·米·豆·菜籽五種為限，……就收益言，以耕種黃百獲利最厚，因種豆無需肥料，成本識輕，而售價亦不若棉花·米穀之遭受統制，故每畝盈餘竟達五百餘元之多，利息之優厚，為上各項農產品之冠；而耕種棉花匪特無利可獲，且不敷成本甚钜，按三十二年四月之人工·工資及原料市價計算，種棉一畝，約虧折四百六十餘元。種穀米一畝，獲利二百十八元；小麥獲利二百零七元；菜籽獲利一百九十元。」棉花原料之價格，受統制之限價，　耕者無利可獲且虧折甚鉅。影響棉花生產，日趨嚴重；棉紡織工業勢必减工或停頓矣。除上述經濟　棄外，更有進者：　消　：（甲）减低租賦；（乙）識輕農產運費與便利營運；（丙）推廣農業貸款，嚴厲取締高利貸制度。　積極的：（甲）設立貸款金融機關，以　利貸　農民，以資　　；如購買種籽·肥料·農具及生活必需品等；（乙）設立產銷合作機關，以免奸商從中操　取　；（丙）規定農產物之合理價格（估計成本與利潤），須符合統制經濟政策與增產之目的　可。</p>
<p>社會方面　　節約消費，提倡以　　替代米·麥。故吾國糧食米麥外，官提倡兼食馬鈴薯及豆難糧，　普及農業敎育與灌輸科學知識，培　農業改進技術人員，俾指導衆民施用肥料，選擇種籽，及栽培合宜天時地利之農作物，應用新農具，及增產之方法等工作。並灌輸農民以科學智識—「人定勝天」，不可「聽天由命」。　嚴屬制裁奸商囤積，操縦物價之心理與事實。</p>
<p>乙·治本的方法</p>
<p>開墾荒地　我國耕地面積，向無確實統計，據美人貝克之佔計，中國可耕之地，約七萬萬英畝，即我國可耕地，可達總面積之百分之二九，巳耕地約　可耕地百分之二六，即一萬八千萬英畝云。倘貝克氏之統計可靠，則我國可耕地，應有四六萬萬餘畝。可耕而未耕之地尙有三四萬萬畝，倘政府能全力協民振興墾殖，則我國亡耕地自可大增，問農產量亦隨之增加矣。</p>
<p>修治水利　水利與耕種，休戚相關，不容偏　。　河長江水患，為國人所熟審者，而西北各地之亢　，亦為關人所悉知者，　弊審所及，影響農業民生至鉅。於此，不謀農業之增產則巳，否則修治水利之遙，安可視若無觀乎。况水利工程浩大，為國家民族千百年之大計，決匪民力所能舉辦也。</p>
<p>選擇種籽　世界各國農業專家，在政府與學術機關指導之下，無不竭其畢生精血，致力於農業之改進，食糧之充實，　義之改善，及生產量之增進。故有不待其苗，已下其秀，不　其秀，巳下其實，斯乃應用科學方法之功，又　　不注意與倣效焉。</p>
<p>改良土壤與肥料　土壤之分析與改良，誠為當務之急。戰國　相晏嬰使楚，曾與楚王有言曰：「淮南為橘，准北為枳」。其種一也，邊地而異其果，何也？吾人若以科學立塲論之，則如淮南淮北之士瓖氣候不同而使之然耳。此項工作須由政府實騐機關創辦技術研究所，加以扶助指導。近年來吾國農耕需化學肥料日增，以肥料缺乏，價格昻貴，農民無力購買，亟須由政府機關以低價貸與或配給各耕農，以利增產。</p>
<p>改良農具　吾國求救作器具簡陋，鮮有改良，若能採用新式耕作機械，則其功　必增，至施用發動機農業機器（如　美農業國），或為事實所不許，然政府或農業合作社或促進協會等，能租借以較現代化之簡單發眞加抽水機，耕耘器械，打　器等，並派員加以指導，則對於增產之效果，良匪鮮淺也。</p>
<p>防除害虫　虫害以蝗患最為嚴重。據昆虫學家估計，全國損失每年均値十二萬萬元云。治本之法為：　加　防　；　淸除雜草；　整理涸澤荒山；　普行冬耕。</p>
<p>改良耕培方法　我國地域廣大，各地氣候地質各異。需加以實地研究，施以不同之栽培方注：（甲）施用輸栽制度，（乙）改良旱地耕作法，（丙）研究水晚稱間作，（丁）請騐宜栽何種農作物（如棉·森林·雜積·蔬菜等）及施以適當肥料，（戊）研究耕　之分景與時期。灌溉之深淺等問題</p>
<p>2．如何增加工業生產</p>
<p>吾國現代工業始於一八六二年　　藩氏創　安慶軍械所，及李鴻章氏創設製　局於上海蘇州二地，迄今已有七八十年之歴史。就其性質言：由軍需工業移至民需工業。就經營之　織言：由官營而宮民合營而官督民營以至民營。就發　之過程言：消末為創　時期，民　為昌盛時期（輕工業黃金時代）民十一年後為衰頹時　，民二十一年後為興　時期，迨民二十六年戰事爆發後為破壞時期。國營　民營輕工業毀壞嚴重，非數字所能統計。就特微言：　中國工業中三分之二為手工業生產，三分之一為現代輕工業。換言之，中國工業之現代化尙未臻完成。　中國現代工業中，　主要產業部鬥大都操於外人之手，而中國民族資本　業大抵處於被支配地位。例如機械類之生產最百分之二三·五為國人製造，百分這七六·五皆仰賴於國外之供給。　中國現代茶業　大都　　於沿海或沿江諸都市，尤以租界內之工業特別發鴻，故頗易受外國政治與經濟勢力之牽制。　交通運輸及金融機關大都為外資經營，致國內資源受外人之支配，不能發展自國之輕重工業。　中國民族　大缺乏及高利貸。就種類言，全國工業中最佔重要者為：　紡織工業，　食品工業，　化學工業，　造紙工業，　　發工業，　皮革工業，　油類工業，　膠類工業，　火柴工業，　烟草工業，　　製藥工業，　　文化工業。以上諸工業均為民營類工業。</p>
<p>作者以為　今　工業之增產，其先決問題為：　如何　劃經濟建高計畫？　如何重建現代工業？　過去現代工業失敗與不能增產之原因何在？　目前現代工業不能增產之近因何在？</p>
<p>據　見並參閱各國家之意見，簡答如次：</p>
<p>一，經濟建設為一民族國家復興之計劃經濟。　　之經濟建設計劃乃近代史上最明顯之實例。査吾國過去雖亦有四年或五年經濟建高計劃，惜未見之實施，「事在人為」，更居首要。故政治的建設與革新，仍屬當務之亟。夫政府以取信於民，始能切實施行其計劃，「民無信不立」，古今中外之名律。「政治委於官，經濟屬於民」之政治經濟機構，決不能再存在於現代化國家。總之，經濟建高須由政府切實籌劃且體縝密之方策，官民同心，全力以赴，必底於成始可。</p>
<p>二，依目前吾國人力，物力財力及現代工業發展之過程言，推有與建輕工業：尤以利用本國農產加工製造，使農工　協調增產，普遍合理化。</p>
<p>三，查吾國過去工業失敗與不能增產之原因頗為複雜，茲略舉其較要者於次：　受外國經濟侵略之壓迫：　政治不安定；　　金融未臻穩健；　資金支絀；　原料缺乏；　技術落後；　工廠管理欠善；　政府無獎勵扶助工業之實際高施；　運輸不便；　苛捐雜稅；　　金融界與工業界不能取得合作</p>
<p>四，目前工業不能增產成停頓之近因為：　原料缺乏；　製成品之成本較高，而其價格（經限價後）反低，無利潤可圖，且有虧本之危，勢必停　；　動力不足，電力與燃料受限制，生產無法增擴；　製成品進銷困難，而本埠購買力減弱；　政府機關與企業家不能合作協助；　技工日减，因工廠或减縮或停頓，而工資不能步生活指數日增，勢必改業。　工廠糧食配給不足與工資增高。以上七端確為各廠家最　痛苦之問題，影響工業增產，至重至钜。希當局　　設法力補苴之道。</p>
<p>為今後工業增產計，作者提出下列諸急圖補救之意見，是否有當，尙希讀者賜教。</p>
<p>一，政府及金融機關設法獎勵或扶助工業　凡輿再需及民需有密切關係之民營輕工業，　由政府與余融機關予以資助，並督導其利用國內農產物，配合增產。例如：棉紡織工業，化學肥料工業，農產加工工業，日用品化學工業，製紙工業等是。其獎勵或扶助增產之方法為：</p>
<p>資金之補助　創　工業，首重資金之充裕；政府與金融機關補助資金之法有：（甲）貸款　由政府或金融機關供給或貸借低利資金，訂定於相當期限或獲利後，淸償貸款。（乙）保息或給與補助金　由政府指定某　軍需或民需工業，按其資本給與利息，使從　該項工業者，無患資息支細之慮。此外，由政治採用津貼金方式以補其虧缺。</p>
<p>原料之供給　原料為工業製造之主要用品，大都賴他埠輸入，倘由政府徵集配給，　原料價格劃一，運費減輕，各種運輸上之麻煩均可免除，則原料成本遂低。因之產品亦有一定價格，則廠家亦可安心製造，得合法之利潤。</p>
<p>技術之指導　由政府派員隨時監督各工廠增　之實況及指導技術上應改進之點。次由政府組織技術研究機關，一方面聘請國外技術專家來華研究指導，一方面訓練技術人員補助各工廠。</p>
<p>動力之供給　現代各工業部門均需相當動力如電國燃料等。政府或發動力機關對於各工廠供給充分之動力及燃料，取費低廉，以便減輕製成品之成本。</p>
<p>製成品之運銷　徒有大量之增產而不能運銷，則勢必貶價或造成奸商囤積之危。宜由統制機關收買，給以合理價格。若收買價格低於成本，則統制經濟之結果，為工業的停產。</p>
<p>二，管理之改善　過去吾國現代工業之失收與效率低落，管理方法之欠善，有以致之。國內企業家徒注間推銷與製造二部，而忍略管理之重　。今從各產業　門之內部組織，須施行科學管理法，提高行政及土產效率。如工人勞作時間之分配，原料採　與運營方法之改進。製造程序與　器之考慮，工廠安全與衛生設備之佈置，資本資金之　劃與運用，產品質與量之改進，製品成本之預算與　核　問題，均在管理之列，</p>
<p>三，技術之改進與合理化　各廠家　　其製造之資源，動力，製造方法，以具體的計畫與合理的配合增產始可。技術的改進為漸進的，須用技術人才，次如勞動力的分配，輸流作業制的採取，各工業部門之配合生產—分工合作制等，均與增進生產有密切之關係。</p>
<p>3．結論</p>
<p>按諸吾國農工業現狀，勢須復興增產；而此二問題之解決、尤需標本兼治，因　統　，而政治的建設與經濟的建設，關係至重，務需相輔而行，始克有成。</p>
<p>農工二業，雖云各異，即各有其獨立性；然究其實，互為因果，即各有互存性，決不能過重。故農工業之增產，亟需在一完整的經濟建設計畫之下，互相配合，互相協調，始臻生產的合理化與　　化。</p>
<p>目前吾國農業增產，以食糧興　　　首要。工業增產，以民需輕工業最為重要。二者增產困難之共同點為：　政府金融機關與生產者不能協力合作：　國民經濟　　；　缺乏科學智識及技術與指導機關；　統制經濟機構未臻完善；　農工業生產的配合未達合理化，普遍化；　交通運營之艱難。</p>
<p>以上諸端，若能早日設法補救，朝野協力同心，集中人力，物力，財力，全力以赴，則經濟建設大業，庶其有豸矣！</p>
<h3>增加農工生產我見</h3>
<p>— 天驥</p>
<p>今日欲求抑平物價，取締囤積；對內安定民生，對外協助建設大東亞，蓋亦進增加幾工生產而巳矣，就筆者觀感所及，目下可能利用而使產量增加者，約有下述：</p>
<p>關於農業方面</p>
<p>一·實行冬耕　目下米糧　貴，頗有婁人於秋收之後，試種小麥，另置小數菜田，以便來年充作秧田之用，俟小麥割罷，其用，浙東一帶，實行冬季種麥，結果：稻景未見減少，小麥且僅　收，據科學研究，換種種植，確能休養地力，故能增加收穫景。</p>
<p>二·用荒地　我國荒地極多，實逵十四萬萬畝以上，事變以來，頗有已被破壞之公路，目下大可利用。各地良田中蔓草　生，地方政府可勒令人民耕之，務使地無曠土方已。</p>
<p>三·收買問題　政府收買米糧，往往未能合理，佃農每有賤價出售米榖，而　身所需向市塲高價購買之事，且大地主往往盈倉累箱，待善價而沽，此後望負責人員，於收買時，先為佃農作一最低限度之打算至少須留佃農一家一年之食糧，對大地主尤須切實執行法令，不可徇私，收買價格，亦須兼顧成本，農民生活程度，及利潤。</p>
<p>四·農具和肥料我國大都為小農制度，分田而耕，實不適用機械，兼以農村破產，無力購買，是以發民利用機械者絕無僅有，目下耕牛一頭，昻逵萬金，此諸小農所能購買，不得已仍以老弱充任，或以人力補其不足，器既不利，事焉能善；當務之急，政有應全力保護耕牛，並設法增加牛之產景，目下舶來肥料斷絕，亟須製造殺虫劑，化學肥料等，然後以等於或低於成本之價値，賣給農民，　水利灌溉，亦應注意，否則空言增產，農民心雖有餘，如力不足則。</p>
<p>關於工業方面</p>
<p>一·目下我國工業有三大矛盾現象：</p>
<p>一般工廠多以存貨乏漲價為主要盈利，視製成品出售為長途，乃至限制生產，待善價而沽；所謂增資亦多為本身公司股票之市價，作有利發展而已；此其一。</p>
<p>最近政府收買紗布，囤戶大受打擎，然收買業已匝月，遲遲未見配給，而上海一地，更有不少小規機之手織工業，平日胥賴黑市棉紗製造，目下　處可買，先後停工，形成社會之嚴重現象，此其二</p>
<p>政府提倡節約，電力限制頗嚴，施行以來，不正當之娛樂塲依然不夜，一般賴電力發　之工業，卻大受打擎，不能盡量利用機械，在此電力限制之下，欲求工業生產之增加，何異緣　求　，此其三</p>
<p>上列三項，顯而易見，政府應迅速予以指導，救濟，調　庶幾工業能走上正軌。亦國家之幸也。</p>
<p>二·復興手工業　我國新式工業，固已發展，然鄉村工業，仍占優　地位，其崩潰尙係最近之現象，事變　還，我國工業三分之二　毀或內遷，際此局勢，舊式手工業，實有獎勵復興之必要，且目下利用手工業，其利有三，（一）重工業發展，須賴機器，目下來源斷絕，且發展亦非一朝一夕可能完成，而舊式工業機械製造簡易，國人能自行製造，（二）目下舊式工業，並未全部崩潰。鄉問一帶依然有此勢力存在，復興容易，（三）手工業製成物品，簡單耐用，甚合節約之獎，故目下實有提倡之必要也。</p>
<p>三·致力於必需品之生產　我國經營實業者，每多集中厚利而無風險之事業，致使生產不勻，今後凡有關國計民生之工業，均應增加其生產量，反之非必需品，如造酒·製箔，化妝品業及奢侈品等類，在戰時經濟體制下，應竭力縮少　額，　節省人力物力而用於正當。</p>
<p>四·勞動問題　勞動為生產要素之一，然其　於生產　　之大小，都　勞動之興趣，能力，　　而有異，目前工人大抵　不數出。頗足影響生產　事，甚至共同　　，廠　依然有損無益。</p>

<p>上接第六版</p>
<p>五·技術　我國工業技術非常落後，例如以紡織工業而言，事變前日資紗廠，紡二十支紗，每萬錠用二四〇工人巳足，而華資紗廠。則非三五〇—七五〇工人不可，近來日本工業突飛猛晉。我國只見退步，鮮有改良，此點實須友邦技術人士乏切實指導。</p>
<p>六·原料應予充分給　目下舶來原料久巳絕跡，國內原料尙須當局法盡量疏通來源，即統制方式，亦當以廠商能獲取原料之便利為依歸，庶幾工業界仍能運用共原有設備，以供給各種必需品。</p>
<p>七·不斷工作週制之應用　燃料，原料問題如能解決，為謀增加生產，則可實行不斷工作週制，此法創自蘇俄，其特點為工人生活可得相當調節，而各工廠仍得不斷生產，　　每週工作以五日為單位，一週五日之內，作工四日，休息一日，政府視各種工業之情形，制定個別之工作週制度，可使工人輪流値班，各有不同之休息日，我國工業頗可酌量試用。</p>
<p>八·文巧雕飾物品之取締　一物製成後，再加雕飾，固可　昻其値，然此部手　，於目前情形顯不適宜，且雕飾後之物品，必不若初成之堅固耐用也。</p>
<p>九·獎勵日本政府近為促進生產，增加起見，施行價格褒獎制度，該制分特別及一般兩種，前者為特定緊要物資增產時適用之　後者依據統一成本　算，形成個別價格時適用之；前者又分二種，其一為各工塲礦山等等，生產　超過標準產　之上，例如所增加之產額，　百分之二十時，其增加部分，則由政府高價收買，其價格且用　增計算，其一為生產　　之　縮時，行之，例如造船工業，一艘船舶之營造時期，嚴定為三個月，若營造時期减為二個月，或二個半月時，　生產時間縮短，政府亦以高價收買。此為獎勵生產之重大設施，　者亦分二種，其一為特定之工塲事業較之前期生產費減低，而能率向上，則使用褒獎制度，其一為工塲之生產成本較同業其他工塲之標準成本為低時，依照其低廉成分，給以褒獎，此外各種發明，如代替品之發明，軍械之改良等等；更有特殊之獎勵，語云：「他山之石，可以攻備」上述亦足供吾人之參考也。</p>
<p>十·金融界　作充分之援助　平時一國工業之發展，原有賴於金融界之支持，戰時尤甚，蓋戰時於杌　不安狀能之下，往往因工廠之存款全　提出，對外放款未能收囘，陷於週韓不靈之困難中，金融界亟應貸予款項加以扶　，而完成其所負之使命</p>
<p>總之，我國農工均尙幼稚，前途實有賴於政府之指導扶　，尙望賢明當局對內能安定民生，抑平物價，對外完成獨立自中，解人民於倒　，措國家於　石，是固　者所馨香以　者。</p>
<h3>如何使國民增進健康</h3>
<p>— 沈嗣良</p>
<p>民國三十二年的雙十節，承申報編輯以「如何使國民增進健康」一題寄節徵文，筆者雖濫竿體育界有年，可是弇陋無文，尤鮮經騐，不得已就以體育為全旨，取來敷陳一下，分兩點如後，以　參考。</p>
<p>體育的影響</p>
<p>以前我國國民的習慣往往是好靜惡勞，所以對於體育一道向不重視，後來鑒於世界各國日臻强盛，體育發展愈烈，而民放勢力益形優原，乃憬然知體育的重要，於是竭力提倡，急起直追，現在比較各國演進的程度，雖然相形見拙，也可說是家喩戶曉了。本來體育的基本原則，就是鍛鍊體魄，對於身體的影響，不特增加體重，助長肌肉，並能發　各種器官，充厚人們的思想和精神。譬如一個人終朝伏案，沒有體育方面的活動！等到時期一久，背部就會　　的變成　　，在這時候，如果沒有體操式的運動，以從事補救，那末背　肺弱，氧氣不能深入，同時　尖的　細狀底血管，也不易流通，養成將來肺病的因素。或者腸胃因為受　　　的壓迫，引起消化不良的症狀。他若精神衰弱，思想遲鈍，也會同時發生了上述的病症，在我們人羣中時常有發現的，眞是十分危險。所以我們幼年時候，　附着脊骨的肌肉，應當常常保持正直的姿態，偶然發現了這種不良的現象，立刻用體操式來鍛鍊，才能恢復，所以崇尙體育的人，在工作方面，有忍　性和持久性，因為他經過常期的鍛鍊，能使全體血液循環加　，肌肉的收縮堅韌。照生理學家檢騐報告，運動員體內的血球和血球，素並不　常人多，祇是運動員體內的血液能夠加速的和不斷的輸送着氣到肌肉　去，所以肌肉的持久力幾乎是無限的。人們在繁劇工作的時候，是在消耗肌肉裏的黏着性，黏着性減少，肌肉的　作就遲鈍，因而感覺疲乏，而運動員在運動的時候，他的肌肉是經常地消　和補充，循環不息，已經習慣了，所以運動的人在工作時候，常會感到愉怏，是健康所賦與的。總這，體育的影響，是發展休魄，而其目的，是一·强健各器官，二·堅韌肌肉，三·動作敏捷。</p>
<p>鍛鍊體魄的階段</p>
<p>鍛鍊身體是有階段的，少年適宜的運動朱必合於幼年，壯年的朱必合於少年，各有適應身體的正用，不可强同。例如兒意自六歲至十歲，為初　　育時期，在這時期，應以體育為敎學目標，換言之，就是養成活潑和健全的身心，發達兒童固有的游戲天性，所以教材也側重遊戲和自然的活動，任他們自由發展，敎學課程似應作為副課。等到十歲至十四歲纔予以正式體育的課程，並且每天應該强迫作二小時的課外運動，他們的體育目的在訓練人類生活上必需之活動，與技能，如跳·擲·攀·懸。跑步等，運動。因為在這時候他們身體的發育，比任何時期為强，此外最好還要習練游泳，以助長他們的肌肉底發達，一個十四歲至十八歲的靑年，是在遂漸轉向　鬥和競爭方面，所以應當性意他們尙武精神的養成，運動目標應多以器械體操，田徑·球類·競賽·拳術等為主要項目。學校當局除體育正課外，更宜予以三小時左右的課外活動，在靑年時間，還需要提倡戶外運動，野外露營，鄉村旅行等以調節他們的生活。因為這個時期，也可以說　年危險時期，如果沒有正　的娛樂，恐容易誤入歧途，這是應當注意的。到了十八歲以上，應當從事於軍事訓練或勞働服務·來堅韌他們的筋骨，德國在戰前特設靑年營，實施軍事的勞働服務，强迫靑年參加，設有專部，負責管理。除勞働服務外，又有有規則的遝動，正常的娛樂集合無數靑年於一營，養成國家觀念，利用鍛鍊靑年的機會，興辦各種建設，如水利工程，開墾荒地，建設道路，改良農產，這都是國家鍛鍊靑年的收　，一舉兩得。我人可以倣效。此外，社會體育的設備，為喚紀羣衆互相觀摩　見，如公　體育塲游泳池健身房都應該在每一城市中普遍地設立，使每一個人能得鍛鍊的機會和環境，須知强健體魄不是一蹴即幾的，全持不斷的努力，方能得到眞正的健康，自今以後，願我國人以體育為唯一要務。從事鍛鍊，無一暴十寒之譏，有堅忍不拔之志，則民族健康的前途，庶幾右　了。</p>
<h3>國民健康問題</h3>
<p>— 仇文科</p>
<p>今天，是中華民國第三十二次的國慶日，忻逢　日，我們來談論怎樣增進國民健康的問題，是極有意義的。</p>
<p>國民健康與政治健全</p>
<p>現在　也　庸諱言，中國是充溢着暮　。人民與政府，鴻溝隔離，各謀其生。卅二年的中國試問，「參戰」和「建　」從何做起。一個賢明的政府，為復興祖國，無不先與人民打成一片，而後，才能發生效果來的。所以，我們在論增進國民健康問題之先，竭誠請願政府，從　設立民意機關，務使上下總力，早日修　政治，在談增進國民健康問題中，我們為什　又再提到「修明政治」呢？因為，國民健康和政治健全，是唇齒相關的，譬如說：一國之國民個個都是健兒，但上面的政治十分窳敗，人民與政府，各不相通，人民不幫其力，飾也不盡其利，請問，這個國家如何能生存下去？因此，我們一面為自愛的「國民健康」問題談論，一面也十二分的希望政府深深自省一下。</p>
<p>檢討國民衰弱原因</p>
<p>過去不必提論，　　觀察現在，全國國民十分之八都巳有了病。最普遍的是胃病與肺病，為什麽患這兩種病的人來得特別多呢？因為，有吃的人，吃得太多與沒有吃的人，太沒有吃了。眞像吉田東祐先生於九月十九日的申報星期評論「論中國餐」一文裏所說的：「……在中產階級很少的這個家裏，有專門吃中國餐（指四冷，四熱，十大菜，點心，一湯——文按）的階級，同時，還有食其唾餘而生存的乞食階級，這種人比任何國家都特別多。與中國人跨稱中國餐在分量上和花樣上為世界第一，同時，食唾餘而生存的乞食階級的數目，也不能不算世界第一。……」故有　階級的把胃囊吃呆及乞食階級的胃囊太缺乏滋潤、兩者的胃都巳失常，而成胃病。患肺病的，也是同上面生胃病的原因一樣。中產階級的人鳥通宵沉迷在烟酒　　中，生活無規律，精神體力，消耗殆盡，日久成疾。乞食階級的人，非但營養奇缺，而且都是　集蟄居小街陋巷，人品流　，空氣汚濁，加以精神上受的種種壓迫，以致神萎力乏，這都是成癆疾之最大原因。總而言之，國民衰弱，是被太不平等的現象所致的。</p>
<p>從速勵行「自愛」運動</p>
<p>上面所指出的兩種最普通的病原，也祇有政府的力量，才能迅速地療治。如禁絕烟賭，强迫節約，鼓勵迎動，獎勵生產，增加戶口糧食及配給日用品等安定民生事宜，都是對症的良藥。奈何，政府並不積極地去做，任其自由藥延。我們因鑒於國民健康問題是急待解決的，也是一件刻不容緩的急務，所以，祇得消極地倡導「自愛」遝動，勸勉國人禁絕烟賭，攝生健身為重。若使這種運動能發揚起來，至少，也可以保持點國家元氣。</p>
<p>怎樣增進靑年國民健康</p>
<p>筆者年靑，閱歷所限，所以，祇得把題目從小來論，而專以現代靑年，不論貧富，作為討論題目的對　。靑年諸君，在未論及題目之先，我們應該以「自愛一兩字，緊緊地把握住，作為討論題目的根據。因為，若不如此，這題目就無從談起。現在，旣然為自愛而談怎樣增進我們的健康；我們應立刻各自反省一下，我是站在墮落之途，還是踏在前進的　道上。若是屬於前者的，應猛然囘頣，痛心悔改，勵行我們的「自愛」運動；若是屬於後者的，更應加倍努力，勇猛精進，永久站在「自愛」運動先鋒隊的地位。</p>
<p>實行自愛運動具體的　法　我們這裏分有一種消極的攝生和一種積極的健身。</p>
<p>消極的攝生</p>
<p>因我們都巳站在「自愛」的信條下，所以攝生法約，取得非常嚴格●一·不吸烟（烟為害心臓，氣管，腦神經）二·不飮酒（酒為害中樞神經，眼力，腸胃，心臓，然有人說，少飲酒能和血取暖，但靑年人，往往剛銳好勝，舉觥豪飲，作為榮事，終傷身為止，所以靑年人還是不飲酒的好）三·不跳舞（音樂因能陶冶性情，然舞塲川流人物，良莠不齊，純潔的靑年，緣被物質享受所引誘或被性慾所衝動而失却理智，故跳舞為害儉省與身心）四·不賭錢（好賭者，根本上就談不到自愛，因為賭，使人通宵達日的極度刺激神經終乃神傷志廢為止，故賭徒是無理智的動物）五·每日三餐，食至不餓為止。這是一瓤一飮，亦當知足，樂而受之，免去物質　　　　悶傷感。每日至少飮水四大杯。尤其在臨睡時　須飲開水一杯，次晨大便得通。睡眠時間，八小時最為標　，睡時，百思摒絕，不作遐想，可免失眠，夕陽四下，閒步半小時，活動筋骨，心曠神怡。此上五約，若能奉行不　非但終年不病·，且可延　多年。</p>
<p>積極的健身</p>
<p>工們若要把身體練成銅筋鐵骨，必需首先，實踐上述五約；否則，攝生不良，徒　了在鍛練時的一番苦功。其次，鍛練身體，胥賴恒心，勤奮不輟，方能成功。健身法門類衆多，其中最易速成　最能感趣者，莫如器械運動。然滬市對於此項運動設備完善者僅計靑年會之健身房，時代體育館，上海健身學院及精武體育會。為數太少，而且塲地狹小，所以，此項運動至今不能普及。但是，我們可以自置一二付五磅及十磅重的錢啞鈴，使用在每晨一　點之柔身操時。此對於　臂力之增强及胸部之發展，有意想不到的神效。如斯，自練一年半載後，再合夥四五「健力美」的同志，組織小小健身會，添置器械，互相勉導。這樣，器械運動勢能普遍流行起來。</p>
<p>靑年國民健康與國家的朝氣</p>
<p>俗語說得好：「靑年是富於朝氣的」。這朝氣，就是靑年們「活動力」的具體的表現。一個强健的靑年須配合着堅强的意志，始能表現出那活潑潑的動方。然而，堅强的意志應建立在正確的人生　與社會　之上，才能盡其善用。正確的人生觀與社會觀是去向人類裏找尋公義。國父能夠百折不撓地革命了四十年，就是因為他把堅强的意志建立在正確的人生觀上。所以，我們靑年人；除了為着保持增强我們的活動力，在矛盾的生活裏鬥爭外，更應積極地把活動力利用在這動盪的大時代裏，為着自由，平等，博愛，奮鬥到底。那末，我們的中國，始能剷除暮氣，樹立朝氣。</p>
<p>增進國民健康</p>
<h3>一個具體辦法</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>健康之意義有二：一為消極的不易感染疾病；一為積極的能夠吃苦耐勞。國民之於國家旣如細　之於身體，國本在民，民本在生，未有國民不健而能維持其國家者，未有細胞惡化而能繼續其生命者，有健康的國民，才有健康的國家，人民將怎樣可以健康呢？這個問題可非空言所能解決，必須政府與民間合作，政府提倡於上，民間醫師協助於下，脚踏實地去倣，方能有效，我現在擬了一個具體辦法寫在下面：</p>
<p>屬於政府的</p>
<p>政府的責任有二：一為消除威脅健康的因素；一為建設增進健康的大道，威脅健康之大敵有三：一為疾病，二為鴉片，三為戰爭。</p>
<p>（甲）消極的辦法</p>
<p>（子）對於疾病</p>
<p>健康最大的敵人，就是疾病，所以愈是不健康的民族，他的疾病就愈多，死亡率就愈大，何以故呢？無非是因為人民不知衛生，以致一切傳染病都相襲而至，未病的時候，旣沒有預防的準備，已病了又往往因為醫藥事業不發達！如醫師之不敷分配及醫院太少等！而枉死了不知若干。這樣民族自然一天一天的趨於衰老的一　了。其補救方法如下：</p>
<p>防疫接種　凡傳染病流行至廣者，都稱為疫，不過霍亂與天花在中國每年均有較多的發現，所以防疫的疫字，實際上似乎專指這兩種病而言，夏秋以霍亂為多，春冬以天花為甚，近幾年來，因為普遍接種的緣故，疫勢巳不加從前猖獗，但强迫接種，未必是百無禁忌的，許多病症如進行性之肺結核症，心臓肌質炎，腎臓炎，糖尿病，胃瘍以及年老衰弱者均不宜注射，　此類病人每因接種後，反應强烈而致本病加重，甚至不起，普遍接種千萬人中，豈無若干犧牲之　，雖無統計，時有見聞，故　先施診察不可，盲目接種，不足為訓，又如天花一症，小孩患者居多，若在成人，則甚少見，强迫接種施於兒童猶可，施於成人似非必要。</p>
<p>旅客檢疫　時疫往往借帶菌者之旅客，由甲地傳至乙地，甲國傳至乙岡，許多疾病中國本來是沒有的，是從外國來的，故對於海陸空旅客，應加以檢疫，尤其對於海外開來的船隻，施以嚴密的檢査，毋使外國疾疫傳，中國。</p>
<p>防癆運動　癆病的死亡率，在中國至少在上海居最高記錄，國家經濟上損失亦以癆病最甚，政府應在山淸水秀的地方，殷立療養院，以隔離此種病人，但最根本最有效的防癆方法，要算卡介苗BCG之接種，此法施行簡易，嬰兒初生十日內分三次那用，即可得終身免疫之效（此苗可向上海金神父路巴斯德學院索取，不費分文），注良意美，惜為多數人士所不知。</p>
<p>娼妓檢査　花柳病以梅毒之害最為廣連，近賊一己，遠禍子孫，因此婦女流產或嬰兒天亡，其數當不可勝計，娼妓者，花柳病策源之地，禁絕娼妓，實為根本之圖，但事實上不易做到，較好的辦法應一而施以檢査，如發現有傳染可能時，則暫票其接客，一面廣設花柳病診所加以治療，雖未能使花柳病絕跡於世，亦可减少其蔓延。</p>
<p>改進貧民生活　中國近二十年來關於衛生知識的傳播，似乎不能說是沒有相當的成績，可是知道衛生的僅僅是中上階級的人，而那些無數的貧民階級，衣食尙且不周，更何衛生之有，中上階級的人盡管守着衛生的壁壘，以為一切的傳染病都可以避免了，而這些製造傳染病的貧民階級，不斷的將生產過剩的病菌傳播過來，對於這種大多數貧民階級的救濟，是要改良環境，以境進他們的生活，毀掉他們的黑暗的牢獄似的住屋，而另建築和開設一秤最經濟，最衛生的居住的一地方及飲會的地方，以解決他們的住食問題，對於他們的疾病是要設立一種施診所和平民醫院，來代他們診視。</p>
<p>取締江湖醫藥　大凡天下之欲以偽亂眞者，皆可謂之江湖，孔子曰言　而議，行偽而堅，惟其　也，故能傾世俗之聽聞，惟其　也，故能博社會之信仰，故江湖云者，任術而不任學之謂也，無其實而有其名之謂也，醫藥皆有江湖，常借誇大廣吿惹人注意，誘人就診，其結果雖名利雙收，而枉死城中亦平添若干寃鬼，所以江湖醫藥之威脅健康，其壓力不下於病菌之作崇。</p>
<p>（丑）對於鴉片</p>
<p>自鴉片戰爭以後，黑禍乃蔓延至吾國，因此人民之志氣日　於頽唐，身體日趨於薄弱，類年以來，政府對於禁烟政策，雖數經頒布，而吸老自吸，種者自種，運者自運，誠未能收若何之偉效，今則變本加厲，吃烟之所，到處林立，鴉片之外，又有嗎啡，白麺，紅丸，北地　兒等毒物，其威脅健康不言可喩，今後政府若不決心禁絕，祇食圖目前大宗之我收，吾恐不出百年，民無噍類滅種可待。</p>
<p>（寅）對於戰爭</p>
<p>兵凶戰危，古有明訓，以血肉之驅，當砲火之烈，兵有不粉骨碎身者鮮矣　况大兵之後，必有大疫，威脅健康，莫此為甚，恒求勝利早得，和平之神，早日來臨，則幸甚矣。</p>
<p>（乙）積極的辦法</p>
<p>鍛練國民體格　以上所言，是消極的辦法，單講消極的衛生，仍然不能達到衛生的目的。積極衛生的方法，在提倡運動，鍛鍊體魄，利用天賦的本能—抵抗力，同環境　　，來戰勝環境，抵抗力是愈用愈强，愈不用愈弱的，體魄鍛鍊了，不但健康增進，而且可以改造遺傳，許多累世不絕的遺傳病，因運動可以停止發現的啊。</p>
<p>勵行優生政策　語云，强國必先强種，欲積極的增進國民健康，根本非從靑年男女愼重結婚着手不可，結婚之前，兩造身體，須經醫師檢査，得有健康證書，大概兩造俱强者為最上乘，其次一强一弱亦可用，其兩造均弱，尤其是具同一弱點者，則絕對不能結合云。</p>
<p>製訂禁婚條例　禁婚有暫時的及永久的不同。暫時禁婚，如肺癆梅毒等，在未治愈前，結婚當絕對禁止，永久禁婚，如生為天閹，或不可治愈之絕症如羊癎瘋及大麻瘋等，如是則弱種不致流傳，可達優生之目的。</p>
<p>舉辦健康保險　年來生活高昻，醫藥費漲，貧病階級，日見增多，於此時也，乃有所謂保健事業之興起，査保健制度，在歐西歷史已久，始創辦者，　為德國，繼而推行各邦，法蘭西經十年之討論，始於一九三〇年由國會通過，其所製訂之法規，亦不下數十百條，蓋以此種制度，關係於國家人民者至鉅，故創行之始，不得不加一番　審之考慮與嚴密之規定也，保健事業這宗旨，完全在救濟貧病，保障以低薪給度日者之健康，而非商業牟利之性質，故此項機關應由國家而不由私人創辦，其經費半由政府供給，半由勞工與資方分認，此為最合理之辦法。</p>
<p>抑低米糧物價　米糧缺乏，物價高昻，對於健康等於打擎，管子說：「倉　足，而後知禮義」，今則戶口米每人僅一升十日，時猶愆期，於是人人菜色，個個啼飢，營養不足而謀健康，豈非　北轅而北其轍耶。</p>
<p>屬於醫師的</p>
<p>以上種種均政府應該舉辦之事，若夫在野醫師，則成於協助地位，其實職在疏導民衆，使政府得以推行盡利而巳。。</p>
<p>正確醫藥衛生之宣傳　宣傳醫藥知識是現在醫界的口頭　，但是在正式醫師實用還種政策尙未收效的今日，江湖醫生巳經大為利用牠了，幾年前各報副刊皆有這種廣告性質的江湖醫刊，一般江湖醫生發表其似是而非的論文，來做盜名牟利的工作，試問社會的人士眞懂得醫藥的，能有幾人，如何能不為他們的廣告和文字所引誘呢？故醫藥衛生之宜傳，應該以正確為主，否則一言以為知，一言以為不知，關係國民健康，可不慎乎！</p>
<p>結婚妊娠育嬰之指導　　醫師責任不僅在治愈一病一人，關於健康之人事指導，亦負相當責任，結婚妊娠育嬰諸問題，關係於國民健康至钜，當著為指導，試舉數例以概其餘：</p>
<p>今日婦女多為免生產之苦，倡人工避孕之說，醫者當誨以正義，語以懷孕為婦入必經之過程，對於身體有益無損，且許多神經症狀，因懷孕而消減者。</p>
<p>婦女憚哺乳之勞，有覓乳媼以自代者，有飼以牛乳或煉乳者，其為流弊，不可勝言，醫者亦當善為指導。</p>
<p>小兒生後每以嬌養致疾，或食乳過量而致痴肥，醫者常糾其諺誤，我國俗語所謂：「要得小兒安，常帶三分飢與寒」者，非必無理由也，凡此種種，其目的均在减少嬰兒之死亡，而達强國必先强種之說也。</p>
<p>衛生政策推行之協助　上面所述的防病工作及禁毒運動，醫師均可直接協助推行，故如防疫針之注射，傳染病之報告，烟民之檢騐，烟癮之戒除，烟民之檢舉均是也。</p>
<p>綜上所言，雖老生之常談，實為增進國民健康之具體辦法，二十年來醫界同志及鄙人所言者屢次，而至禽未能見諸事實，　因申報雙十徴文之便，特重加整理，條而別之，以備關心醫事衛生者之參考焉！</p>

<h3>國畫源流概述</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>引言</p>
<p>劉海粟先生　硏西洋畫，尤兼擅國畫，繪術精湛，馳譽世界。昔年　集歷朝國畫傑作，攝影製版，印成畫片，依　家出生時序輯成巨帙，頗為　　，惜因故阻滯，未即發行。頃由本報裝訂成冊，頒名「普唐宋元明淸名畫　鑑」，定今日國慶發行。是冊之首，劉氏爲文，概述國畫源流，都八千言，凡國畫歷史，原原本本，叙述無遺，不僅有志繪事者所宜一牘，即關心國粹人士亦宜涉臘。爰將是文全部付刊，聊以點綴此國慶祝賀云爾。</p>
<p>我國畫始於象形文字，即書即畫未分也。歷虞夏商周，畫乃四書分立。漢之張衡蔡　輩皆以畫名，雖未睹共曠，固已彰睹史藉。洎乎魏晋六朝，佛敎輸入中國，中國文化煥然開一新局面。當時佛敎畫流入中國，我頗能吸收其所長，而所調新藝術者於焉產生。斯時名家輩出，韻流神發，畫風丕變，最著者如吳之曹不與，晉之衛協，顧愷之，宋之陸探微，南齊之謝赫，梁之張儈　，隋之　子虔，董伯仁，鄭法士，莫不才異學遂，類能役物而不爲物役。而　陸張展卓然稱爲畫家四祖焉。</p>

<p>魏晉南北朝之畫，得外來思想，外來格式與民挨固有之精神調洽滋養。頓呈極健全充分之發育，以迄盛唐，國勢隆盛，政治昌明，文章詩賦，蔚爲國華；畫亦因之進於最高尙完美之境域。蘇軾題吳道子畫云：「智者創物，　者述焉，非一人之所能也，君子之於學，百工之於藝，自三代歷漢至唐而備矣。故詩至杜子美，文至韓退之，畫至於吳道子，古今之變，天下之能事盡矣。」蘇氏以如此眼光，稽覽中國之文化，的有見地。唐畫上承魏晉六朝，下啓宋元明淸；鬼神，道釋，人物，宮室，山川，龍魚，畜獸，花鳥，無體不備，無美不臻，吳道玄人物，固絕百代；山水木石，亦開南宋，閻氏昆季，「立本立德」冠冕一時。他若張萱之貴公子，固昉之仕女，曹霸，韓幹之馬，戴嵩之牛，薛稷之鶴，韋偃之松石，是皆專擠，各造極峰。獨山水分南北宗者，唐前期絕少專家，後期始稱盛也。李思訓，王摩詰始以純粹之山水畫爲尙，李思訓一派，　法細勁，開靑綠傳彩之法，王維一派，筆意縱橫，創水墨渲淡之格，風會所趨，各自發揮獨特之精神，我國山水畫自是遂有南北二宗之分。以李思訓爲北宗之首，王維爲甫宗之祖。明董其昌曰：「禪家有南北二宗，唐時始分，畫之南北二宗，亦唐時分也。但其人非南北耳。北宗則李思訓父子著色山水，流傳而爲宋之趙幹，趙伯駒，伯　。以至馬遠，夏珪輩，南宗則王摩詰始用渲淡，一變鈎斫之法，流傳而爲張璪，荊，關，董，巨，郭忠恕，米家父子以至元之四大家……」北宗寓變化於嚴整，筆實神凝，氣韻特厚，南宗漸脫跡象，筆意瀟　，氣韻雅逸。李思訓爲唐之宗室，曾爲武衛大將軍，故人稱爲大李將軍。子昭道界畫精細，世　小李。王維家於　川，著畫學秘訣，有曰：「畫道之中，水墨爲上，肇自然之性，成造化之功。」其藝術觀，巳可概見。宋蘇東坡曰：「味摩詰之詩，詩中有畫，觀摩詰之畫，畫中有詩。」可謂精鑒者矣。共受王維之影響者，有盧鴻，鄭虔等盧鴻隱於嵩山，世稱嵩山高士。鄭虔與李杜爲詩友；杜詩所稱「鄭公樓散　成絲，酒後常　老畫師」者也。王洽之潑墨山水，亦獨樹一幟。項容，畢宏之松風泉石，亦藝苑之大雅也。</p>
<p>唐末五代禍亂相尋，歷年頗久，畫苑自不及唐代之盛，但亦有超絕古今之大師多人焉。荊浩，關仝之山水，徐熙，徐崇嗣，黃筌，黃居寀，周文矩，趙昌，易元吉之花鳥人物，貫休之佛像異獸，皆冠絕百代，爲畫宗師。</p>
<p>兩宋</p>
<p>畫至五代，上承唐之樸厚，而新開超逸華妙之體，至宋人出，而集其大成。故宋代繪畫盛於唐代，實中國美術史上之黃金時代。西紀九七六年，宋太宗詔天下，搜求名蹟，設秘閣於崇文院，珍藏古今名畫。迨至徽宗，更命　輯宣和畫譜，蒐集宮內繪　，計有六千三百九十六軸，就各畫之品類，析爲十門。宋代注　繪畫，歷三百年而不替，天才旣多，派別斯起。</p>
<p>宋之山水畫，有超絕唐代者，人才蔚起，遂成古今獨步，最足代表中國昌盛時代之藝術，溯初唐之山水畫，初不過脫離古代人物背景，獨立一體，其藝猶未達極致也。自王維，張　，畢宏，鄭虔之徒出，深造其理；五代荊關，又別出新意，一洗前習。　乎宋之董源，李成，范寬，三家鼎立，開唐人所未具之體貌骨法，畫風影響於後代，至今勿替。董其昌謂：「宋畫至畫巨，盡脫廉纖刻畫之習，都以墨染雲氣，有呑吐變滅之勢，荊關有筆有墨；董巨有筆有墨，而若無筆無墨；營丘李成，華原范寬，則立於荊關董巨之間。時謂董得山之神氣，李得髓貌，范得骨法，窮極變化，南宗至此，其殆神歟。關仝弟子王端，營丘弟子宋迪，許道寗，郭熙。俱得其一體，已卓然名家。高克明未及董李之門，亦稱賢俊。郭忠恕數峰天外，滌墨而成，較王洽潑墨更奇。米元章源出董源，不落蹊徑，自謂無一點吳生習氣。」其言最能闡明宋人山水畫之位置及價値，宋人對於自然與人生之最高理想，一一在山水畫上實現之矣。</p>
<p>董源　色循李思訓，水墨雖似王維，而自出胸臆，渲淡多姿，墨氣淋漓，實爲米畫之祖。傳其法者，釋巨然，江參，蕭照，劉道士，諸家，元之黃公望，倪迂，王蒙，亦遠紹北苑之精神者也。李成以丹靑水墨合爲一體，郭熙亦喜爲之，畫院　人，爭效其法，其畫派不獨許道寗，宋迪，郭熙，高克明，燕文貴等宗之，其源流及於元明。范寬初師李成，又師荊浩，旣而歎曰：「與其師人，不若師諸造化。」因居終甫太華，嚴隈　麓間十年，目擊雲烟陰　之變，乃脫盡舊習，獨得天趣；尤長雪山，見之使人凛凛，晚年用重墨，山頂好作密林，傳其畫派者，有郭忠恕，田宗源諸人。</p>
<p>論者謂宋之山水畫，超絕唐世者，有上述之三派，派首領皆有其獨特天才，非古人所能掩者。迫米芾及其子友仁出，獨創手法，畫作雲山，神奇變化，名振於時。嘗曰：「伯時病右手後，余始作畫，以李常師吳生，終不能去其習氣；余乃取高古，不使一筆入吳生。」叉以山水古今相師，少出塵格，因信筆爲之，多烟雲掩映，大氣波動之神趣。董其昌曰：」詩至少陵，書至魯公，畫至二米，古今之變，天下之能事畢矣。」旨哉言乎。</p>
<p>院體創自五代工秀妍潤，斤斤規矩。北宋之末，高宗初年，趙伯駒伯　兄弟傳北宋衣鉢，而發揚光大，筆法　細如牛毛，極細麗巧整之致，遂樹南宋畫苑之新幟。而李唐，劉松年，馬遠，夏珪，稱南渡四家，說者謂其工巧太過，殊不之重。</p>
<p>兩宋之道釋人物畫，受院畫之影饗，風格亦日趨織細。名家如孫夢卿，孫知微，陳用志，馮靑，李德柔輩所作佛畫，咸能脫却印度畫之拘束，自成一派。其奇者，爲儈牧溪，擅淡墨觀音，龍虎，花鳥，無所不能，拖泥帶水，用墨如傳彩，賈師古，學龍眠整巧之格，傳於梁楷，楷又創减筆之新畫風，作山水，人物，釋道鬼神，猿猴諸圖，其布墨高古不可及。</p>
<p>畫之六法，難於兼全，吳道玄而後，獨李公鱗始能兼之。公麟佛像直迫吳道玄，山水氣韻淸秀，爲王維正傳，著色山水，又似李思訓，尤好畫奔馬飛龍，實能集各派之大成者也。</p>
<p>花鳥畫自五代黃筌，徐熙各樹新幟以來，至宋而大盛。宋徽宗，天才卓絕，勾勒淸勁，傳彩古艷。若文人墨戲，多作枯槎壽木，蘭竹梅菊，筆力跌宕於風烟無人之境，則文同，蘇軾最爲著稱。</p>
<p>元代</p>
<p>元以異族，入主中華，雖無畫院之設，而繪事極盛。上承來之餘緒，而開明淸近代畫之新體；尤尙淡逸超脫之格調。若以上古，中古，近代分析中國之畫史，尋其藝術發展演變之途徑，而鑑其遺跡，則當別漢以往爲上古，六朝至唐宋元爲中古，明淸爲近代。唐以上之畫蹟，已不易觀；故言古畫者，開口輒曰宋元。雖然胡人滅宋，滿人滅明不過一時獲得政權上之勝利，而於文化藝術上之發展絕無阻碍。故元襲宋風，淸領明風，漢族文化繼續前進，而胡滿却反　　　，　　　人交之　力，不亦　　！　　之繪畫，今自所傳之名蹟，首推趙文敏，高房山，錢玉潭，王若水諸人。子昂書畫兼妙，發明書畫同源之說，彼高古微妙之人物，鞍馬，山水以辛竹石，深得晋唐之趣。董其昌曰：「吳興畫法，有唐人之致，去其纖；有北宋之雄，去其獷。」其妻管道昇，子仲穆，弟仲光，及仲穆之子允文，彥微，皆名震一時，藝苑傳爲美談，高克恭承北宋　米法，善淡墨山水；花鳥　，當以錢選，王　　巨擊。舜舉慕趙昌，易元吉之風，而爲徐體之妙手；若水專工黃體之雅麗。若　　能　　先代之作述，而示後人以典　。至　良以後，李息齋，柯九思等之蘭竹，亦柬坡與叶之支流耳。</p>
<p>元之四大家黃子久，王叔明，倪雲　，吳仲圭出，以其高士逸筆，揮發胸中　壑，遠祖荊關董巨法，近取營丘華中意；於是充明淸山水畫之極則。黃公望生平畫格有二：　作淺絳者，山多作　頭，筆勢雄厚，一作水墨者，皺紋極疏，大癡在其幽靜簡遠之筆　中，感覺其生活之快愉。前人亦曰：「寄樂於畫，自大癡始」吳仲圭創舉爲濕點苔之法，得宋人三味；故其筆端豪邁，無一點市氣。王叔明爲趙子昂之甥，畫法神似其舅，又受右丞董巨墨法之影響；其用筆亦從郭熙捲雲皺中化出，神彩爛然，秀潤可喜·其作，多峯　層疊，蹊徑紆迴，烟　微茫，曲盡幽致。倪迂稱其筆力能扛鼎，五百年來無此君，信矣。元四家中，倪瓚之作，品氣最高，可稱極端之文人畫。嘗自言曰：「僕之所謂畫者，不過逸筆草草，不求形似，聊以自娛耳。」古淡天眞，米癡後一人而已。觀其畫，如經園囿林谷之中，而登瀛洲天堂淸虛之境也．今人但沾沾於繁簡擬雲林者淺已。</p>
<p>明代</p>
<p>朱明代胡元一統天下，繼紹趙宋之遺緒，朝廷復設畫院，如邊文進，范還等以花鳥，郭純以山水，應召爲永樂內殿供奉。宣德畫院，爲明代最盛之時期，與宋之宣和紹興兩時期相輝映，畫院人材，有謝環，商喜，戴進，李在，周文靖等，咸入直仁智殿。戴進之絕技，堪稱明代名手，林良林郊父子，爲畫院中寫意派之妙手。成化之際，吳偉，呂紀，呂文英等，皆直仁智殿。吳偉以畫稱旨，授錦衣百戶賜畫狀元之章。呂紀，呂文英稱大小呂；又張圯者，亦有聲弘治畫院中。正德前後有王諤朱端二家，共直仁智殿。王諤稱當時馬遠。萬歷初，王延策入畫院，顧炳供事內殿，明代畫院之影，不下宋代，惟其畫風非復宋元。</p>
<p>明之山水畫，集王維以降，荊關董巨營丘二米趙文敏高房山乃至元四家之作風，具文人　之典型者，稱爲吳派，此派自董其昌沈顥以來，呼爲甫宗，目爲文人士大夫之畫。浙派戴進，院體周臣，名之曰北宗。並謂院體風骨奇峭，揮掃燥硬，有野狐禪，非吾曹當學之　，此則門戶之見，非篤論也。夫畫別南北兩宗，蓋自董其昌。然唐以降，歷代之山水畫，豈此一二變遷所能盡哉！香光所分二大系統，恐亦未見及此耳。即言水墨爲南宗之特色，而北宗馬夏，亦何嘗不專水墨；裁構及設色之平淡野逸，蓋南北派俱有此美。世稱李大將軍，亦能士大夫之畫，目歷來北宗畫家，要皆文人；南宗作者，以畫爲業之行家，亦數數見。是則南北宗之差異與褒貶，乃爲明代吳派浙派傾軋之結果實如漢宋門牆之見，而文人相輕，自古已然也。文人論畫，尙南貶北，風尙所趨，極盛一時，沈周文徵明，名重藝苑，因而有吳派少稱；緣此派大匠多吳人耳。嘉靖以後，董其昌陳繼儒輩出，紹沈文之遺緒，發揚光大，不遺餘力，遂成中國畫史上之一大思潮，浙派幾無立足之地。萬歷而後，香光一統畫苑，流風所被，歷淸代綿綿不絕，其勢概可見矣。沈石田天資卓絕，自得天授，故能窮唐宋名家上下千載之奧。王穉登贊石田曰：「休矣！煌煌乎！沈先生之作，集厥大成，其諸金聲而玉振之者歟！」文徵明亦出沈氏之門，山水兼董巨大　雲林之長，神釆氣韻俱勝，雖極似子昂，然白具一種淸和閒適之趣，論者謂巾其人品高潔所致。微明與吳寬，祝允明，唐寅友善，三十年如一日；子彭嘉，從子伯仁，書畫皆絕，家學相承，可謂盛矣。</p>
<p>周臣乃由院體推移變化而過渡吳派之畫風，人物古面奇裝，織穠冶麗，山水巒頭崚嶒，直追李唐；唐寅，仇英，皆出其門。子畏山水人物靡不臻妙，得劉松年李晞古之　法，行筆秀潤縝密，而有韻度，蓋能矩　　哲，而銳出天機者也。從來師法北宗者，皆有作家習氣，獨子畏含英咀華，稚氣滿紙，實宗北而貌南者。此外文人士夫之擅藝事者，則有王冕，王緩。元章畫梅竹淸秀高古。孟端山水師法黃鶴，長江遠岫，叢　怪石，當時稱爲第一。共次有以墨竹著名之太常卿夏昶，文名藉甚。嘉靖萬勝間有錢穀，項元汴，孫克弘，莫是龍，徐渭，周天球，謝時臣，陸治，　迪光，王思仟，張瑞圖，李士達，李流芳，米萬　，盛茂燁，吳彬等，指不勝屈。錢叔寶詩文書畫，皆受文衡山之指授，落筆點苔，沉着不苟。項墨林博學多聞，精鑒賞，富收藏，山水蘭竹輕淡籃有逸趣。莫雲卿，高介絕俗。孫雪居山水花卉幷皆佳妙。徐天池潑墨淋漓，筆意縱橫。周天球　寫　，而有畫卷氣·謝　　　石　法，而變化多端。李長蘅，山水有清標之致，逸氣飛動；與唐時升，　堅，程嘉燧共稱為嘉定四君子。吳文中筆意綿密，力　韻雅，人品既高，則藝　自無　俗之氣，傳世山水極少，故彌足珍貴也。米萬鐘，張瑞圖之蒼潤，陸包山之奇峭，李士達之朴厚，皆能各樹風標，離合文沈。其餘蔣嵩張路等所學宋元，未免獷野，不為世　，於是華亭派繼之而與。華亭派者以董其昌元宰為之領袖。董官至禮部尙書，　文敏，時文書畫皆稱絕，自　突過趙文敏，故落筆便有瀟灑出　之概，其畫不宋不元，顛倒一時，較元賢朱，民唐子華輩固優，較曹雲西錢選亦有過之無不及；逸淵蒼　，骨骼秀發，墨法之　，尤為獨得，　　乎韻勝者也。嘗自言：「氣韻不可學，生而知之，自然天授；然亦有學得處，讀萬卷書，行萬里路，胸中脫去塵濁，自然邱壑內營，立成　鄂，隨手寫出，皆為山水傳　。」效董者，趙文度而下，無慮數十家，皆與董同時。香光與沈文唐，並稱明代四大家。萬歷至崇禎問，有陳繼儒，程嘉燧，倪元璐，惲向，黃道周，楊文驄，祁　佳，宋旭，沈士充，顧正誼，　文瑜，邵彌，王建章等，陳眉公跌　風流，着筆蒼渾，不食人間煙火。程孟陽博學品高，山水法大痴，以腴潤見勝。倪元璐，黃道周並以詩文書法重於當世，山水松石高古絕俗，不食人間煙火。「江流天地外，山色有無中。」悟此詩者，方能觀倪黃之畫也。楊文驄亦以山水竹石見長。三家者·皆晚明殉國之士，氣節文章，彪炳當世，故其筆蹟彌為天下珍重，有偉大之人格，然後有偉大之藝術也。惲香山之山水，出自北苑而別成一家。祁　佳詩書皆學於思翁，畫頗整巧。趙文度師法宋旭。沈士充則出文度之門，其書畫有烟雲變滅之趣。以上諸家有訓之蘇松派者，顧正誼之流，則稱華亭派，皆有董思翁之遣風，下文瑜之山水樹石，勾剔有古意，邵瓜疇，王建章書畫兼長，狗爲華亭派，吳梅村作畫中九友歌，以董玄宰居首，王時敏，王鑑，李流芳，楊文　，程嘉燧，張學會，卞文瑜，邵彌等皆屬之。由此吳派中，又有雲間派與婁東派之別，王麓臺曰：「明末畫家，類多琉曠雋逸，自立堂戶，一變宋元面目。」豈不然哉！</p>
<p>明花卉之畫，於邊呂二家，林氏父子之水墨寫意派夕外，文人則有沈石田，陳淳，陸洽，周之冕四家。石田翁之花卉，輕淡沒骨，設色水墨皆備，別成格調，爲明代花卉文人派之開始。陳白陽，陸包山，周之冕，皆出自啟南。前述之徐渭亦多作花卉，與白陽同一神妙，跌宕風流，不可一世。</p>
<p>人物畫，前有蔣子成，而後有阮福，萬歷時則有丁雲鵬，吳彬，吳廷羽，丁南羽博學能者，長於白描之佛像羅漢。吳文中亦長於白描羅漢，故宮所藏之二十五圓通圖，朴原精奇，奕奕如生，明代之人物畫第一大家，則爲仇英。英最工於仕女風俗畫，舖陳得法，情景如生，實人物畫上之新格，至於樓觀旗輦鞍馬之類，亦極精密，神釆生動，不讓趙文敏。能傳十洲之畫，除其女杜陵內史外，殊不多見。尤求，程環，石銳均受其影響，迨明末崔子忠，陳洪綬出，別創人物畫新格，時稱南陳北崔，爲仇十洲以後之人物畫大家，而開淸代人物畫之新紀元焉。傳神寫照之名人，則曾鯨出而轟動一時。萬歷十年意大利敎士利瑪寶來朝，能窵耶穌聖母像，會波臣乃折衷其法，而作肖像，所謂波臣派之寫照也。</p>
<p>淸代</p>
<p>滿淸入關而主中華政權，制度文化，固多仍明舊，藝術思潮，亦仍紹述前代遺緒耳。明沈石田，文徵明以來，吳派勃興，董其昌，陳繼儒起，盛名壓藝苑，論畫尙南貶北，一時風靡。故淸代藝苑，南宗獨盛幾三百年，非無因也。唯於明未而迄淸初，紹浙之衣鉢，而一洗蔣嵩等粗獷之弊，開淸代山水畫健實精硏之美風。爲浙派後勁，嶄然出人頭地者，厥爲藍瑛。其子藍濤，藍孟，以及禹之鼎均傳其畫風。浙派之外，又有稱袁派者，特長樓閣之畫，即雍正間內廷供奉之袁江及袁耀，袁雪，三家之後，巳成絕響。</p>
<p>浙派旣衰頽不振，而吳派逮夫淸初，益臻變化之極，故南宗一統，淸代畫苑，最負大名者，爲淸初六大家，王時敏烟客，王鑑元照，均承香光。烟客窮大痴之奧，時謂得一峰正法眼藏。元照沈着古逸，力追元人。王　石谷，吳歷漁山，同出烟客之鬥，融合南北，不落窠白；雖品格不同，神韻則一。麓臺曰：「墨井造詣，不在耕烟下。」非虛語也。乃一則名塞寰內，尊號古今畫聖，一則寂無所聞，後來至有不識漁山為何許人者，不亦重可慨哉！壽平惲格，胎息宋元，氣韻超逸，以恥爲天下第二手，避石谷而爲沒骨寫生。麓臺王原祁亦法宋元，直追子久，四王吳憚，鎔鑄宋元明別成一體，而其流宏布至今，在畫史取得特殊之地位。六家領袖端推烟客，畫有特　，　時即爲　翁眉公所激賞，山水勾勒所拂，虛靈神逸，隨意點染，邱壑渾成，淵深靜穆，其嫩如金，藝苑此詣，惟烟客獨　也。傳烟客之畫風者，其子王撰，及吳歷：傳元照之畫風者，爲王原祁</p>

<h3>Citizens Should Double Their Efforts – Mayor Chen’s Broadcast on the National Day of the 32nd Year of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>Gentlemen:</p>
<p>Today is the Double Tenth National Day of the 32nd year of the Republic of China. The Republic of China, born from the Xinhai Revolution, is now in its prime. Having overcome many hardships and difficulties, we are able to enjoy freedom and independence today, which is something we should celebrate. However, our responsibilities are now greater, and our undertakings are expanding. I would like to quote a phrase from the Father of the Nation: "The revolution has not yet succeeded; comrades must continue to work hard."</p>
<p>Today's National Day is different from those of previous years. It is a major event unprecedented in history, which all of us citizens should thoroughly understand and strive to work even harder for in the future.</p>
<p>The Significance of This Participation in the War</p>
<p>The first major event is the participation of the Republic of China in the war. You all remember that China participated in the First World War as well. However, this participation in the Greater East Asia War is different from the previous participation. The first participation in the European ____ was merely a war among the great powers. In other words, it was simply following behind Britain and the United States in a war to seize their interests. Although there was Wilson's propaganda in the world at the time, and other pleasant-sounding articles on paper, claiming that the war was for justice and righteousness, and that nations could exercise self-determination after the war, China still could not exercise self-determination after the end of the European war, and small and weak nations around the world still could not exercise self-determination. All colonies... even India, which Britain had promised autonomy, still could not exercise self-determination. On the contrary, imperialism's shackles on East Asia became increasingly stronger, and its instigation of disputes among the countries of East Asia became more frequent. Therefore, China's previous participation in the war was no different from being an accomplice in the international arena, and no different from binding ourselves. The significance and reality of China's participation in the Greater East Asia War this time are completely different from the first participation. We are not only seeking liberation for ourselves, but also seeking liberation for all nations in East Asia. China is now independent and free, and the colonies of East Asia, Burma and the Philippines, are also independent and free. Even the people of Malaya and Java have gained the right to participate in politics. This ideal is very grand, and this ____ is very important. It is in line with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, and it is precisely in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will that we unite with the nations of the world that treat us as equals, and strive together to move forward.</p>
<p>Abolition of Unequal Treaties</p>
<p>The second major event is the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions to the Republic of China by Japan and other countries. Gentlemen, do we want to know the meaning of the abolition of unequal treaties, as proclaimed to us by the Father of the Nation? China's inability to be independent and free, and China's inability to become a modern nation, was entirely due to the shackles of unequal treaties. Now that extraterritoriality has been abolished and the concessions have been returned, the goal of liberation sought by the entire nation of China since the revolution has been achieved. This year, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo made a solemn statement to the Diet that he would revise the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty signed in the winter of the 29th year. The implementation of this statement is imminent. From now on, China will be a completely independent and free nation in the world, and a completely equal nation in the international arena. Our people across the country, after countless hardships and difficulties, have obtained today's liberation, which can be comforting to our ancestors. It can be comforting to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's forty years of dedication to the revolution, and it can be comforting to all the martyrs who established the republic since the Xinhai Revolution.</p>
<p>However, why did I just quote Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, "The revolution has not yet succeeded; comrades must continue to work hard," to encourage you all? It is because the Greater East Asia War is still underway, and comprehensive peace has not yet been achieved. Therefore, we must double our efforts.</p>
<p>Efforts in the Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>Regarding the unfolding of the Greater East Asia War, we should examine ourselves to see the extent of our cooperation. We also know that in this Greater East Asia War, we have made considerable contributions of materials, and the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have provided no small amount of assistance to Japan's restoration and construction of Southeast Asia. However, we must not be satisfied with this, and we are even more willing to make a step forward in cooperation. President Wang has proclaimed to us that we should live or die together with Japan. Therefore, we should not be content with sharing the joys and sorrows with the Japanese people in the rear, but should be willing to live or die together with the Japanese soldiers on the front lines. We must know that this Greater East Asia War is not a matter of the survival of a certain country in East Asia, but a matter of the survival of all nations in East Asia. China is not only seeking liberation for itself, but also seeking liberation for all nations in East Asia. Therefore, we must establish security in the rear, increase production, and even more so, organize the people and train soldiers. We hope that one day we will bring forth the spirit of the Chinese nation to seek righteousness and benevolence, and carry out the liberation of all Asian nations on the battlefield, and fight against the imperialists.</p>
<p>Seeking National Liberation</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I deeply wish to say a few words to Chongqing. The goal of the National Government is to seek comprehensive peace, and even more so to seek cooperation with Japan to defend East Asia and liberate East Asia. Perhaps our ideals are obscured by personal emotions and cannot be understood. However, the National Government has been in power for three and a half years, and our sincerity for peace, the purpose of our participation in the war, the success of the abolition of extraterritoriality and the recovery of the concessions, and the discussion of the revision of the Basic Treaty are all being realized before our eyes. You should all understand. China has gone from being unfree and dependent to being free and independent, and China has gone from being unliberated to being liberated. You should also know these facts. The significance of the Greater East Asia War is based on the spirit of Eastern morality, in order to realize the liberation of all nations. We should even more so rely on the spirit of Eastern morality to understand Japan and participate in the Greater East Asia War. Now the Sino-Japanese Incident has become a term of the past, and I hope that the people of the whole country will base themselves on the will of the Father of the Nation and the spirit of wisdom, benevolence, and courage of the Chinese nation, unify China, unify peace, and the whole country will join this war against imperialists to liberate East Asia, in order to complete a great undertaking in history.</p>
<p>My beloved citizens, today is truly a once-in-a-millennium opportunity, a good opportunity for us to revive China, and a good opportunity for us to defend East Asia. Since the Opium War, we have often been oppressed by others due to our weakness. From the late Qing Dynasty to the early Republic of China, we relied on the international balance of power to survive. Since the First World War, we have relied even more on the League of Nations... In short, we relied on the parallel movements of Britain and the United States to survive. From now on, we are a completely independent and free nation. We should rouse our spirits, exhaust our mental and physical strength, to strive for survival, seek liberation for ourselves, and also seek liberation for all of Asia. I respectfully wish the Republic of China a long life! Long live!</p>

<p>Economic Circle Commentary</p>
<h3>Increasing Agricultural and Industrial Production</h3>
<p>For this year's National Day Commemorative Edition, our newspaper specially solicited articles, focusing on "How to Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production?" This issue is a major concern for the revival of the nation, and the wartime economic policies announced by the National Government also take increasing production as their central focus. Therefore, how to increase agricultural and industrial production is the most urgent, important, and worthy of research and discussion issue today.</p>
<p>We believe that the opinions contributed by people in society, especially economic leaders, regarding this issue are closely related to the future of China's economy as a whole. Standing from the perspective of the world, we deeply feel that under the resounding call of how to increase agricultural and industrial production, the issue of national rewards should be given special attention.</p>
<p>In order to speed up the steps of industrial production and promote the progress of agricultural and industrial production in both quality and quantity, we feel that the national reward method must include the following key points: Under appropriate price policies, ensure the income of agricultural and industrial producers to encourage their reproduction; Regarding the purchase of agricultural products, special encouragement should be given to farmers' reproduction; Regarding the protection of workers' lives, special attention should be paid to the promotion of welfare undertakings; Implement the method of "exchanging what you have for what you don't have" to promote the exchange of agricultural products and daily industrial products; Support legitimate private enterprises and groups, and give encouragement and incentives to factories they establish that are truly related to the necessities of people's daily life. Priority should be given to those who should be given priority, and preferential treatment should be given to those who should be given preferential prices.</p>
<p>All of these stable and prudent measures must be included in the government's plan to reward the increase of agricultural and industrial output so that the nation's human and material resources can be entirely concentrated in the various sectors of agricultural and industrial production, working together for the great cause of stabilizing people's livelihood in wartime. Wouldn't that be a great accomplishment?</p>
<h3>New Cloth Factory Businesses Request Relief Central Reserve Bank Agrees to Provide Loans Negotiating Methods with China Dyeing and Weaving Bank</h3>
<p>The Cloth Factory Industry Association of this city stated that after purchasing yarn and cloth, the capital of each cloth factory was exhausted, and the livelihood of employees was insecure. The association sent a letter to the Cotton Products Federation to transfer it to the United Association to discuss with the Central Reserve Bank to allocate 20 million yuan in national currency to be transferred to member factories by the China Dyeing and Weaving Industry Bank. The Commercial United Association immediately transferred the letter to the Central Reserve Bank for verification and processing. It is recently learned that the Central Reserve Bank is deeply sympathetic to the request of the Cloth Factory Industry Association to allocate 20 million yuan in national currency for relief and has replied to the Commercial United Association in a letter, which briefly states: "Upon investigation, if the China Dyeing and Weaving Industry Bank, organized by the same industry, can provide sufficient collateral, it can directly negotiate with the Shanghai branch of this bank to discuss loan methods. In addition to informing the branch to negotiate and draft a plan at any time for review and approval, please check and inform [the applicant]," etc. The Commercial United Association has already forwarded the letter for notification after receiving it.</p>

<h3>Supervisory Bureau Cracks Down on Illegal Insurance Companies</h3>
<p>The Insurance Supervisory Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in view of the great importance of the insurance industry to the social economy, stipulates that all institutions engaged in the insurance business must apply to the bureau for registration and a license. There are also qualification restrictions for insurance agents. The bureau recently found that in various parts of Jingzhou, there are those who claim to be insurance companies or agents of insurance businesses. These institutions have not obtained licenses from the bureau and are illegal. The bureau will now order such illegal businesses to cease operations and will also impose appropriate penalties. In the future, all economic insurance businesses must register and obtain licenses and must comply with the Insurance Industry Law for management.</p>

The method is as follows: All matches exceeding one box (1,200 boxes, each box containing 90 sticks) and soap exceeding one box in stock at the close of business on October 9 of this year must be registered with the office by the storage or owner or any person with economic or management relationship to the matches so stored.

It is also learned that the distribution of matches and soap in the urban and inland areas will not be implemented at the same time and will be delayed.</p>
<p>Translation commentary:</p>
<h3>Adjustments to Trading Organizations</h3>
<p>Central China is a link in the material exchange mechanism, and there is a gradual trend of improvement. We see that the recent frequent meetings of relevant authorities are a symbol of promoting trading organizations, which is truly fortunate.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Central China is an important part of the material exchange of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The economic relationship between North China and Central China is even closer. Therefore, the material exchange between North China and Central China can be said to be the foundation of trade activities in the Chinese region. Reviewing the Provisional Regulations of the National Commercial System Association, one article stipulates that the Commercial System Association is responsible for handling the operation of material exchanges in various regions within the country. Therefore, the above tasks tend to develop with the branches of the Commercial System Association. It is sincerely hoped that it will be strengthened in the future.</p>
<p>The material exchange between Central China and Japan is also an important issue. The Japan Trading Group has been the China Trade Federation since its establishment on July 1 this year. Its basic constituents are allocation unions and military distribution groups. Since the reorganization, progress has been very rapid. Regarding the mission of this new organization, Mr. Nishiryo, the Director-General of the Military Distribution General Affairs Committee, said: "With the epoch-making progress in the political system of the current National Government, the China-Japan Trade Federation has new developments. Under this major situation, it has extremely important significance because it can promote the integrated cooperation between Japan and China and complete the holy war. Of course, to ensure the smooth operation of trade associations, all aspects, whether human or material, must be rectified, and only sincere cooperation can achieve the expected goals."</p>
<p>Here, we sincerely hope that the trade association supplementary agencies of the Commercial System Association will coordinate with each other and operate smoothly, so that the material exchange in Central China will be more active, and all matters related to goods, prices, and production will be improved accordingly. Under the current circumstances, there can be no further delays. This mutually beneficial economic operation is too important for the local decisive battle system to be ignored.

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Continued from the eighth page of the National Day Special Issue; those who inherited the mantle of Wang Shigu included Yang Jin, Song Jun, Cai Jia, etc.; while Wu Yushan and Wang Lu were particularly outstanding. Yushan studied under Yan Ke, but drew more strength from Huang He. His work is rich and profound, the best among the six masters, and his style is superior to that of Shigu. He shares the same purpose with Nanshan but has a different approach. However, few of his works have been passed down. Lu often praised Yushan and criticized Shigu, and instructed his disciples, saying, "Among the painters of our time, only Yushan is worthy." Dai Wenjie also said that Wu Mo should be regarded as the best in the current era for his deep and profound works. Lu was particularly outstanding in imitating Da Chi and Qian Shou, his works being neither sweet nor astringent, light yet thick, solid yet clear, with a scholarly aura overflowing beyond the brush and ink. Later, Wang Chen, Wang Jiu, and Wang Yu, crowned with Lu, were also known as the "Little Four Wangs." Among Lu's four disciples, the one who best inherited his mantle was Huang. Shen Deqian's "愚文鈔" lists five people who were famous for their paintings in the contemporary era: Yun Shouping, Wu Li, Wang Yuanqi, Wang, and Huang Ding. They are called the Loudong School. Fang Shishu, Zhang Zongcang, and the Dong Bangda and Dong father and son, Qian Weiqiao and Wei Po brothers, are disciples who respect the ancient masters. They use dry ink to render the mountains and rocks, and accumulated charred ink to depict the trees, lush and shaded. Although they are said to belong to the Loudong School, their spirit and charm actually come from the revered ones. They have surpassed their predecessors and are breaking free from the confines of Loudong. Below Wang Shigu are Yang Jin, Gu Fang, Hu Jie and others, who are called the Yushan School. In addition to these schools, there are also the Xin'an School, the Songjiang School, the Jiangxi School, and the Jinling School. Hong Ren founded the Xin'an School. Dong Qichang initiated the Songjiang School, and Zhao Wendu was its leader. Luo Mu rose in Ningdu and traveled to Nanchang with his learning. His brushwork was ethereal, and his fame moved the officials. Many scholars followed him, and this was called the Jiangxi School. Jue Shijiao, Sun Yi, and Wang Zhirui, together with Jianjiang, were known as the Four Great Masters of Haiyang. The two families of Jiangzuo, father and son, are called Xiao and Sun, namely Xiao Yuncong and Sun Yi. Zheng Zheng, Fang Tingxian, and Gu Daquan were known at the time as the "Three Pillars" for their equal fame and substance. Gong Xian was the leader of the Jinling School, and Fan Qi, Gaocen, Zou Zhe, Wu Hong, Ye Xin, Hu Zheng, Xie Sun, etc., were called the "Eight Masters of Jinling." Their styles were bold, vigorous, deep, majestic, refined, and elegant, and their works were exquisite at the time.</p>
<p>From the early Qing Dynasty to the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, each school had its own strengths and was influenced by the Southern School. However, the Jinling masters still retained the style of the Northern School. In addition, the Ming loyalists Bada Shanren, Fang Yizhi, Xiang Shengmo, Hong Su, Wu Shantai, Zhang Feng, Chuanshan, Mei Qing, Da Chongguang, as well as Zhu Yizun and Weng Songnian, were all able to create their own unique styles and express the unrestrained spirit within their hearts. Bada Shanren became a monk after the fall of the Ming Dynasty. He was good at calligraphy and seal carving, and his paintings were exceptionally unique. He also painted figures, landscapes, flowers, and birds. Particularly outstanding were the two monks, one named Daoji and the other named Kun Can; they were known as Shi Tao. Shi Tao's style was uninhibited and unrestrained, while Shi Tao's was profound and powerful, and he excelled in austerity. The two were also called the "Two Shi." I once read the "Painting Talks of Monk Kua Gua," and it was as if I were gazing into the distant and mysterious, not knowing where his thoughts came from, suddenly enlightened, not knowing where his words came from! What was the scope and depth of Da Chongguang's paintings, which were highly praised by Shigu and Nantian? Hui Chong, Ju Ran, and these two Shi were collectively known as the "Four Buddhas of the Southern School." Qiu Shengsheng said, "The Two Shi have captured the essence of the Southern School," which is indeed true. After that, only a few people, such as Tang Yifen, Dai Xi, and Huang Shen, inherited the Southern School.</p>
<p>Tracing back to the Southern School from Wang Wei and Zhang Zao, it gradually became more subtle. At first, it was misty and blurry; then, the clouds and mountains became illusory. At first, the mountains were deep and the valleys secluded, striving for strange peaks and steep cliffs; then, the water became wide and the sky vast, focusing on ordinary scenery. Those who immerse themselves in it seem to doubt reality and illusion, transcending self and things. At the beginning of the transformation, the real is none other than the illusory, and the illusory is none other than the real; after the transformation, the illusory becomes even more illusory, and the real undergoes further changes. With each change of the real, I do not know where it ends; with each illusion of the illusory, I cannot know where it will ultimately lead. Reality, illusion, things, and self are all the same. Therefore, it is said that confronting reality means eliminating illusion; confronting oneself means forgetting oneself. Illusion upon illusion is the truest reality, which is also absolute beauty. It is like the wild horse and the dust, living beings breathing with each breath. Those who create art focus their intentions on things and their spirits on illusion, letting their brushes flow, unrestrained and free. Therefore, it is said that "xieyi" (意寫, freehand) is the pastime of scholars, while those who criticize it are not real connoisseurs. This is why practitioners are practitioners. Practitioners are not ignorant of the nature of things, but their minds are governed by the heart, and the heart is governed by action, which is probably the limit. Dong Qichang said, "The way of painting, what is meant by 'the universe is in hand' is that there is nothing but vitality before you, so those people often live long. Those who are meticulous and detailed and enslaved by things will lose vitality and will not live long. Ni Zan, Shen Zhou, and Wen Zhengming all lived to old age; Qiu Ying died young, at only sixty years old. Although Qiu and Zhao had different styles, they were both followers, not those who took painting as a refuge and joy." How could it not be so? How could it not be so! The evolution of painting has been rapid! A single thread becomes silk, a second change becomes thorns, a third change becomes Dong Yuan and Ju Ran, then Fan Kuan and the Two Mis, then the various masters of the Yuan Dynasty, and then the masters of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Tracing the path, at the beginning it is moist, very moist, at the beginning it is moist and rough, then it is moist and smooth. Chao Buzhi said, "Painting should write the outer form of things, requiring the shape of things not to be violated; poetry conveys the meaning beyond the painting, not only the state within the painting." Siweng said, "This is Song painting." Dongpo said, "Discussing painting only in terms of likeness is like being a neighbor to children; writing poetry in this way is definitely not knowing poetry." Siweng said, "This is Yuan painting." Yue Zheng said, "Scholars should express their feelings and not forget the source. The main thing is the intention, not the likeness; the emphasis is on rhyme, not skill. Skill leads to craft, likeness leads to vulgarity." I say, "This is Ming painting at its best." Reaching the famous masters of the Qing Dynasty, the form becomes more and more simplified, while the inner intention becomes more and more profound. As they say, "The extreme of splendor is plainness." What is particularly unique is that many famous masters after the Song Dynasty flourished in the Jiangnan region, and especially in Wu. Wang Qian said, "Since Yun Shouping and Monk Hongren, the paintings of Wu have been known for their ethereal, sparse, elegant, and exquisite qualities. Is it because the essence of the sea cliffs is biased towards the eastern land? Or is it the residual charm of the past, influencing later generations?" Alas! I understand! The thoughts of the people of Jiangnan flow like streams, their spirits erupt like springs, carefree and leisurely, unconsciously connecting with the marvelous, their thoughts entering the secluded. Therefore, their paintings are light but full of spirit, quiet but with flowing thoughts, scattered but with integrated emotions, simple but with rich interests, with limited form but endless meaning. This is why Southern painting is the world of humanity and why people of art and learning delve so deeply into it.</p>
<p>Among those who wrote flowers in the Qing Dynasty, in addition to the Southern School, there were Wang Wu and Jiang Tingxi, etc. Wang Wu and Yamada both mastered the "boneless" method of painting flowers, and scholars followed them. Jiang Yuan's paintings are few, and he also learned from Wang An. Among the painters of the Yongzheng and Qianlong periods, the "Ten Great Painters" were the most prominent, including the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, the Four Gentlemen, the Three Wonders of Zhexi, and the Four Wangs and Wu. Among the Ten Great Painters, Gao Qipei, Gao Fenghan, Yu Zhiding, Dai Chong, and Dong Bangda were the most famous. Gao Fenghan's left-handed paintings were particularly interesting. Dong Yuan and Beiyuan, Ni Zan, and Huang Gongwang were known as the "Two Dongs." The Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou included Luo Ping, Li Fangying, Li Shan, Jin Nong, Huang Shen, Zheng Xie, Wang Shishen, and Hua Yan. The Four Gentlemen were Gao Qipei, Gao Fenghan, Wang Shishen, and Zheng Xie, plus Cai Jia and Zhu Mian. The Three Wonders of Zhexi were Huang Yi, Jiang Sheng, and Wu Li. The painters of Zhexi were known for their skill, writing directly from life. Jin Nong and Huang Shen were the most prominent. Hua Yan, Fang Shishu, Qian Weicheng, Zhang Zongcang, Zhang Zongwan, Gu Qian, Fang Xun, Qu Dakun, Shen Zongqian, and Lu Huai were all famous for a time. Among the court painters at that time were the Italian priest Giuseppe Castiglione, Jibingzhen, Leng Mei, and Jiao Dai. In addition to Li Futang, Zou Yigui and Zhang Hua followed the style of Shaonan. Shen Quan was able to skillfully imitate Castiglione's outlining of flowers and leaves and his rendering of life. He traveled east, and his painting style influenced Japan. Yu Shoumin's painting of sugar cane and geese was also famous for a time. He Qi Pei was known for his landscapes, but his figure paintings were lively and could be compared with Qing Teng and Bai Yang.</p>
<p>Among the painters of the Daoguang period were Dong Gao, Wang Honghao, Zhang Si'ning, and Zhang Guangzao, with Dai Xi and Tang Yifen being the most distinctive. Dai and Tang were both loyal and pure, and their characters were noble, so their paintings naturally approached the extraordinary. At this time, there were two "yi pin" (逸品, unrestrained style) artists, Li Yongbin (Yunfu) and Yanghu Mengqin (Yitang). Yunfu's style was ancient and profound, similar to Qing Teng and Bai Yang, and his brushwork was elegant and light, like Du Fu's poems; Yitang's brushwork was ancient and profound, using thick green and blue to paint flowers, making the fresh paper look like ancient silk, clear springs harmonizing, calligraphy, painting, and seal carving being three perfections, seeking vitality in ancient thickness, also a genius of the time. Among the figure painters and calligraphers were Gai Qi and Zhang Shibo. During the Xianfeng, Tongzhi, and Guangxu periods, famous painters included the "Three Xiongs," Zhang Xiong, whose landscapes followed the Four Wangs; Zhu Xiong, whose flower paintings imitated Bai Yang; and Ren Xiong, whose figure paintings followed Chen Hongshou. Then there were Qian Du and Zhao Zhiqian. There were also the "Three Rens," Ren Wei (Weichang) and his brother Xun and cousin Yuan. Ren Xun was skilled in painting flowers and birds, and Yuan was good at painting figures, flowers, and birds. Then there were Wu Xizai, Wu Tao, Monk Guxi, Pu Hua, and Wu Shixian; He Weipu and Lu Hui were also followers of the Southern School. Wu Changshuo's paintings could combine the styles of Qing Teng, Bai Yang, and others, and incorporated the interest of bronze and stone inscriptions, so they were also outstanding, with a vibrant vitality. Qing Daoren wrote Buddhist images in the brushstrokes of bronze and stone inscriptions. Wu Changshuo said: "The paintings of Qing Daoren should be compared with the Lingguang Hall of Lu and the Wu Liang Shrine, seeking position, not knowing Tang and Song, let alone North and South." However, in his early years, he wrote landscapes, entering directly into the masters of Nantian, and in his later years he resembled Bada in his purity. The flowers and birds were in the style of Shitao. It was all due to the same qi. Chen Shizeng was excellent in both landscapes and flower paintings, but it is a pity that he died young, which is also the misfortune of modern art circles.</p>
<p>The decline of our country's painting art has reached its extreme today. It is not only a decline, but also about to be extinguished! Even in counties and towns, there are no known painters. The two or three remaining masters are copying the dregs of Wang and Yun's tasteless and worthless works. Whether done with a dry brush or with a meticulous brush, they are all like chewing wax. In this great world, how can one become a prisoner of painting and still boast about it, or copy and transmit, taking the crude and leaving the essence, spreading paper to paint plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums, or making a few strokes, lacking both rhyme and method, and yet be called a famous master? Is this not a grave injustice? Even those who can earnestly study often get lost in the theory of schools and are limited by their own views, so that the trend becomes increasingly lower and the customs become more and more humble, unable to break free. Some who have heard of it deeply criticize the Zhe school, and those who follow Loudong often criticize Wumen, blindly imitating and finding it difficult to distinguish. Alas! How can the subtleties of painting theory and the greatness of art and learning be confined to a single school or sect? The deeper the view of schools and sects, the more difficult it is to untie the shackles. Therefore, the artistic mind of recent painters has become increasingly narrow and easily exhausted, leaving nothing to admire, and those who are fragmented and broken are even more worthy of lamentation. If the ancestral style is not restored, how can one not feel sorrow?</p>

<h3>The Future Endeavors of Shen Bao - Commemorating the 60th Anniversary of This Newspaper -</h3>
<p>This year marks the 60th anniversary of this newspaper. In order to embody the spirit of "growing stronger with age" and "self-improvement," and to seek the progress of this newspaper, new working guidelines were formulated and solemnly announced to the people of the country in the 60th Anniversary Declaration of this newspaper on September 1 of last year.</p>
<p>In this declaration, it was said: "In the new historical pages that will continue to unfold in the future, how should this newspaper shoulder the important responsibility of leading society and promoting the times? How can we lead society onto a rational path? How can we lead our nation to prosperity and prosperity? This is what our colleagues at this newspaper solemnly and deeply consider and dare not relax in the slightest after sixty years." It also said, "We will actively take action to improve this newspaper, work hard to fulfill our responsibilities, not shirk responsibility, not be afraid of shrinking, and do our best to contribute." At the same time, it also advocated the introduction of new scientific knowledge, the indication of the world economic turning point, the exploration of social problems, the representation of fair public opinion, the guidance and support of young people, the study of border issues, the promotion of immigration to the border, and the presentation of the situation of international politics as the goals of future efforts.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, seventeen days after the publication of this declaration, the world-shaking September 18th Incident in Northeast China suddenly broke out. Subsequently, the January 28th Shanghai Battle followed. Facing the great disaster, the country was worried and fearful, and concentrated its efforts on resisting the enemy at hand. Therefore, the above-mentioned efforts were temporarily put aside and have not yet begun.</p>
<p>From last year to this year, the country has been in constant turmoil, and the national crisis remains "unchanged." The colleagues of this newspaper have realized that the way to overcome the national crisis is not in empty shouts, nor in unconscious blind action. The most important thing is to "do one's best" and to "do" in reality. In order to "do our best," this newspaper has decided to start from now on and gradually promote the realization of the plan announced to the people of the country last year with the spirit of "doing in reality."</p>
<p>1.  In terms of layout, efforts should be made to coordinate news and advertisements and strive for clarity and eye-catchingness.</p>
<p>2.  For foreign correspondences, such as Europe, the United States, the Soviet Union, and overseas Chinese, especially Japan, efforts should be made to publish as many systematic communications as possible.</p>
<p>3.  For domestic local communications, efforts should be made to be universal. Efforts should be made to systematically record the people's livelihood, hardships, and political and economic conditions in various places, with particular attention to the current situation in the lost land of the Northeast.</p>
<p>4.  Every Monday, a special economic publication will be compiled from the space for commercial news, detailing the economic changes at home and abroad during the week, and compiling various important statistics. Commercial news will also be gradually improved to make it readable to the public.</p>
<p>5.  Although "Free Talk" is only a supplement, it is very important for reconciling readers' interests. In the future, the published texts will be divided into long creative works, short translations of world-famous novels, science stories, world customs, essays for women and children, and humorous texts. Interesting public opinion polls or prize essay contests will be held from time to time, adhering to the principles of not violating the trend of the times and being popular.</p>
<p>6.  The "Reader Communication" column was temporarily suspended after the January 28th Incident due to the reduction of space. Now it has been restored and renamed "Reader Advisor." Experts will answer questions about politics, economics, law, occupation, marriage, family, education, rural areas, natural science, medicine, society and other issues.</p>
<p>7.  The local supplement will also add two columns: long novels and shop assistant communications. Every Sunday, an "Amateur Weekly" will be published from the supplement space to arouse the reading interest of general workers, shop assistants, and apprentices, instill various common sense, and improve their amateur life.</p>
<p>8.  A circulating library will be established in this city, selecting and purchasing various common-sense application books for the public. All citizens have the right to borrow books, and efforts will be made to facilitate the borrowing procedures. This will directly promote public education and indirectly promote the improvement of general amateur life.</p>
<p>9.  Various supplements will be added, such as movies, which have already been attached; economic, amateur, architectural, and health supplements, which will be published from December; and education, national goods, and science supplements, which will be published in order. They will all be distributed with this newspaper to other cities, or only limited to this city, so that readers can obtain the knowledge and information they need according to their preferences.</p>
<p>10. The "Shen Bao Monthly" has been founded for half a year. The contribution of the monthly is to state and judge the current political and economic situation at home and abroad, and to point out its trends, in order to supplement the deficiencies of the daily newspaper.</p>
<p>11. The "Shen Bao Yearbook" is being compiled and will meet with the public in March next year (reservations have already begun). The yearbook summarizes the main facts of our country's politics, economy, and society over the past year, and systematically describes them, with various important statistics attached. Each year, a large volume is published, which is tantamount to a faithful history of our country's national conditions year by year.</p>
<p>12. Since last year, this newspaper has hired experts to compile an unprecedentedly detailed map of our country. In fact, these materials have been collected and surveyed by experts over a long period of more than ten years, and are currently being printed and will be published next year. In addition, domestic statistical experts have been hired to compile and translate the latest German publication "World Social and Economic Statistical Charts," and reliable domestic materials have been collected to compile various important statistics on our country, with more than 100 statistical charts and dozens of explanations, which are currently being compiled and translated. The above twelve items are the efforts of this newspaper every issue after December 1. Naturally, this is only the beginning of the newspaper's efforts.</p>
<p>The colleagues of this newspaper believe that the news industry is the most powerful tool for promoting society. Especially this newspaper, with its 60-year history, has at least one million readers every day, which is tantamount to a great educational machine for society. How to use this machine? How to make this machine generate great power and great efficiency? Of course, it is absolutely not something that a few colleagues of this newspaper can do, but rather requires the great power of the public to promote it.</p>
<p>At the same time, on the other hand, the newspaper is tantamount to a sound machine of society, conveying fair public opinion and telling the suffering of the people, which is also the mission that the newspaper should earnestly shoulder. However, whether this mission can be faithfully shouldered, of course, depends not only on a few colleagues of this newspaper, but also especially on the government's love and support. Therefore, at the beginning of hard work, this newspaper humbly expects the public to support and guide it with twelve points of sincerity.</p>

<h3>A Respectful Word to the Chinese Friends of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Old Man Funatsu</p>
<p>There is a Chinese saying, "The people of Qi worry about the sky falling." Right now, the majority of Chinese people in Shanghai seem to be making unnecessary trouble for themselves. Because commodity prices are extremely high, life is very difficult for the millions of people in Shanghai. Originally, the reason for rising commodity prices is, in principle, because of a shortage of materials, where supply cannot meet demand. However, supplies are not necessarily scarce, and there are various reasons why prices are high. The most important are speculation and rumors. All kinds of rumors are used to drastically shake people's hearts and disrupt the market. Furthermore, many unscrupulous merchants take advantage of these rumors to manipulate prices and profit from them. As a result, the majority of the people suffer. So, why are the Chinese so easily misled? There is a reason for this. It's like how people with weak bodies are prone to illness. The Chinese people cannot clearly see the future situation, so as soon as they hear rumors, they become helpless and at a loss. I will further concretely analyze the mentality of the majority of Chinese people. They often hear rumors released by the Wang Jingwei regime and Chongqing, thinking that the final outcome of the Greater East Asia War might be the end of their political power. Even the Chinese intellectual class has this way of thinking. Since they already have doubts about Japan's future, they naturally have doubts about the future of the two National Governments. Since they harbor distrust towards the Nanjing government, they naturally also distrust the banknotes issued by the puppet regime. Naturally, people's hearts are shaken, commodity prices soar, and hoarding of goods occurs as a result. The people's suffering is thus doubled. All this is because the majority of Chinese people cannot clearly see the future situation and lack sufficient understanding of Japan's real strength. Therefore, I say this is worrying about things that are unlikely to happen, and also making unnecessary trouble for oneself.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Actual Experience</p>
<p>Some Chinese people see that this time Italy surrendered, and fear that Japan will soon meet the same fate. When that happens, the Japanese side will definitely be greatly affected, and they fear that Japan will not be able to hold on. This kind of thinking is completely wrong. We believe that no matter how the situation in Europe changes, Japan's foundation will not waver. This Greater East Asia War cannot be ended in three years. At least five years, maybe even more than ten years. During such a long period, there may sometimes be local defeats, which are unavoidable. But we absolutely believe that the final victory will definitely be on the Japanese side. I am not just talking big or striking a high tone; it is based on past actual experience.</p>
<p>What is meant by past actual experience? More than six hundred years ago, the Mongols invaded Japan, and we completely won the war. Let's not mention that history for the moment. We also completely won the wars against the Great Qing Dynasty and Russia. When we went to war with the Great Qing Dynasty, if we compared the military strength of the two countries, we, from a subjective point of view, were of course confident. But from the point of view of a third party, the Qing Dynasty was such a large country, with 400 million people. The North China Fleet at that time (the Beiyang Fleet, which was equipped with battleships of over 7,000 tons), was so powerful. Japan's largest warship was only a little over three or four thousand tons. Those 7,500-ton battleships were like today's 750,000-ton battleships. They were the most dominant force in the world. Therefore, from the point of view of people in Europe and America, Japan would definitely not be able to defeat the Qing Dynasty. Moreover, at that time, British warships in the area were hindering Japan's operations in various ways, even secretly helping the Qing Dynasty. But after the Qing Dynasty was defeated, Japan's army and navy won the war, ultimately achieving a great victory. Britain then changed its attitude. In just a few years, Britain took a step further and signed a military alliance treaty with Japan.</p>
<p>More than ten years later, when we went to war with Russia, if we compared the military strength of the two countries, from the point of view of a third country, Japan's army and navy were no match for Russia. In particular, Japan's navy was far inferior to Russia's. Therefore, at that time, people in Europe and America viewed Japan and Russia fighting as if a child was fighting a strong man. Japan was bound to fail. Even we Japanese were not necessarily confident. So why did we take the risk and go to war with Russia? I will tell you the reason:</p>
<p>In the year of Gengzi (1900), among the various incidents involving the Boxer Rebellion, Russia, taking advantage of the situation, sent troops to Manchuria (Russia did not have many troops, but they occupied Manchuria). Manchuria was considered to be a part of China, so China repeatedly lodged protests. However, Russia ignored them and even considered Taiwan as part of its sphere of influence. At that time, China's material strength was helpless against Russia. Therefore, Japan had no choice but to come forward and ask Russia to withdraw its troops. After several years of effort and negotiation, there were no results. If we continued to endure in this way, although Japan would definitely not be destroyed, it would definitely fall into the ranks of third- or fourth-rate countries. That was exactly the situation of "losing whether we fight or don't fight." Therefore, Japan had no choice but to disregard success or failure and resolutely stake the fate of the country and declare war on Russia. After a full year of war, fortunately, we finally achieved a great victory. Older people probably still remember this.</p>
<p>Recognizing Japan's National Power</p>
<p>This time, Japan is confronting the two most powerful countries in the world, Britain and the United States. From the point of view of third countries, it is still considered an extremely reckless adventure. However, is Japan's national power really that weak? No, Japan is actually very strong. To resolve the Pacific issue with the hands of diplomacy, our diplomats spent a great deal of effort and pondered for a long time. We sent Ambassador Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura to the United States. Ambassador Kurusu was not a diplomat. He and Roosevelt were old friends. Ambassador Nomura was also a veteran. We hoped that they would be able to resolve the problem in the United States. (We once appointed Mr. Shigeno as Foreign Minister, which was for the same purpose.) However, the United States not only did not respond to our just demands, but we saw through their ambition to permanently make Asia our colony. Therefore, we had no choice but to declare war on Britain and the United States. However, our determination this time was carefully considered, and we were fully confident of victory before we began to act. The international situation is the same as when we went to war with Russia, but our national power is stronger than when we fought Russia that year. As expected, within a few months of the start of the war, we broke the strongholds of Britain and the United States in Asia, crushed their forces, and although we have already been fighting militarily for a long time, we are certainly more advantageous than Britain, and after we occupied various places, all military supplies were more abundant than before. We are now defending the land we have obtained, and although the enemy is putting up a desperate struggle, our position is much better than before the war. Britain and the United States are now desperately trying to recapture the land we have occupied, and are fighting hard in various places. However, we are using Sun Tzu's military strategy, that is, the strategy of "waiting for the enemy to tire," to defeat them. Now, the three important factors of timing, location, and popular support are all on our side. Of course, the reason for the final victory, besides battleships, airplanes, submarines, and cannons, is that we Japanese have a spirit of not fearing death and a spirit of hard work and endurance, which is stronger than that of any other country. With this spiritual power and this strategy, we are of course bound to win and never be defeated. I also have one more thing to say: the ancients said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation." I think that we Asians are all responsible for the rise and fall of Asia. If this Greater East Asia War fails (although this will absolutely not happen), we Asians will forever be slaves to others. Therefore, we Asians should unite and cooperate, those with money should contribute money, those with strength should contribute strength, those with knowledge should contribute knowledge, endure hardships together, live and die together, and necessarily achieve victory, to live up to our ancestors.</p>
<p>Achieving Comprehensive Peace</p>
<p>There is one thing I would like to say to my Chinese friends. China has already joined the Greater East Asia War and should have the obligation to assist Japan in fighting Britain and the United States together. However, it is said that the Chinese people do not need to send troops or armies to the front lines to fight. Currently, in China, doing one most important and beneficial thing is the issue of comprehensive peace that Chairman Wang is enthusiastically promoting. If this work of national peace can be accomplished, Japan can also withdraw its troops immediately, and the 400 million people of China can be saved from the depths of suffering. I hope that the 400 million people of China will work together to do this work quickly. Those who oppose or obstruct this work are enemies of the 400 million compatriots and should be expelled completely!</p>
<h3>How Should the Chinese Government and People Cooperate to Revive the Nation?</h3>
<p>— Hakata Nami</p>
<p>The National Day anniversary comes once a year, and today marks the thirty-first anniversary. Reviewing past experiences, understanding current lessons, and planning for the future, I don't know how many women have made speeches. But for practical politics and the improvement of people's livelihoods, how many improvements have there been in government affairs? I guess there haven't been any!</p>
<p>This year's Chinese National Day is a coincidence, and I have been entrusted by the Shen Bao authorities to write an article on "How Should the Chinese Government and People Cooperate to Revive the Nation?" to contribute to the National Day special issue.</p>
<p>Recalling Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionary martyrs, why did they want to overthrow the Manchu Qing government and establish a republic? I think most people probably wanted to reform politics, believing that the autocratic regime had no hope, and that after changing to a republic, the nation's power could be revitalized and the country could be made strong and the people rich. Therefore, on October 10, 1911, the Wuchang Uprising broke out, and the whole country responded, and the Republic of China was quickly established. I remember that during the first National Day of the Republic, it was precisely when Mr. Sun took office as President. At this time, the atmosphere was renewed, the whole world celebrated, national flags flew, the whole country rejoiced, and the scenery of Zijin Mountain was not a small sight. It was truly a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity. Thinking back to today, the National Day celebrations of this golden age have gone and will never return. From Yuan Shikai's usurpation of power and proclaiming himself emperor in the third year of the Republic to the completion of the Northern Expedition by the National Revolutionary Army in the sixteenth year of the Republic, for more than ten years, wars continued, internal strife arose, and there was no peace. Even after the establishment of the National Government in Nanjing, during the Double Ten Festival of the sixteenth year of the Republic, the atmosphere seemed to be renewed, but suddenly the communist bandits launched disturbances, ravaging China, causing the people to live in misery. Since the military forces in the Southeast were unable to quell the rebellion, the National Day celebrations from the sixteenth to the twenty-fifth years of the Republic passed by in a rush.</p>
<p>On the National Day of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, it happened to be the beginning of the unfortunate war between China and Japan. Unexpectedly, the war has continued, and the people have suffered. Now it is the National Day of the thirty-second year of the Republic, and the war has not yet ended. So, although the Republic of China has been established for twelve years, what have the Chinese people actually gained? I think whether it is officials or common people, everyone will frown and sigh. Is this the original intention of creating the Republic? Therefore, it is the responsibility of the Chinese government and people. Therefore, I will study this issue and write this short article to ask for correction from the patriotic people of your country.</p>
<p>How the Government Should Cooperate</p>
<p>Now, let me explain the plan for the government's cooperation in reviving the nation in three points:</p>
<p>Strengthening East Asian Self-Awareness—Chairman Wang of the National Government once said, "The Republic of China has been born for more than thirty years, and it has still not been able to achieve a state of peace. The reason for this is that China lacks national self-awareness in East Asia." This is a sharp and insightful observation. Speaking of East Asian national self-awareness, one is reminded of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. That doctrine aims to establish the Chinese nation as a unit to stand in opposition to another unit. This kind of national thinking is the same as the "Elder Brother Doctrine" thought of Japan since ancient times. Unfortunately, in recent years, Mr. Sun's successors have lacked East Asian self-awareness, and have become slaves to British and American decadence and narrow nationalism. They completely fail to understand Japan, which seeks to establish close ties with China, and mistakenly believe that Japan is an Asian imperialist. This is due to British and American formulas. Therefore, since the Greater East Asia War broke out, followed by China's participation in the war, on the one hand, it is necessary to eliminate the remaining forces of Britain and the United States, which can be called domestic revolution. On the other hand, since China and Japan are now moving towards building a new order in East Asia together, it can also be called world revolution.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Cooperation Concept—Today, those who discuss Sino-Japanese relations cannot but consider that China's impression of Japan has been renewed. That is, China has many directions for understanding Japan. Furthermore, based on this understanding, they take cooperative action. As far as thorough cooperation between the two countries is concerned, China's weakness is equivalent to the instability of the foundation of cooperation. Therefore, in order to strengthen the foundation of Sino-Japanese cooperation, enriching China's strength is not only China's sole problem, but also Japan's problem. Therefore, the Japanese government has repeatedly stated that it is willing to thoroughly assist China's revival. I firmly believe that the day the Sino-Japanese problem is finally resolved is the day China's revival is completed.</p>
<p>Stability of People's Livelihood First—Stability of people's livelihood is the prerequisite for cultivating manpower. Cultivating sufficient manpower can give full play to the functions of power. Currently, the biggest obstacle to people's livelihood is the reliance of a small number of people on special backgrounds to engage in illegal corruption, manipulate the market, speculate, and hoard goods, especially in Shanghai. Although political leaders have expressed their determination to eliminate corruption, corrupt officials are outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant, and there has been no public action. For example, thoroughly investigating hoarding was initially carried out vigorously, but then disappeared without a trace. The situation in this regard is certainly not something outsiders can guess. Another example is the grain ration, which is "the people take food as their heaven." Since the recovery of the concessions, only the "postponement," "price increase," "reduction in quantity," and "poor quality with sand" of the rationed rice have been heard, which has led to the miserable cries of the people. I know that no one in the Chinese society feels satisfied with the rationed rice. If the people's food problem is so messed up, where is the space for governance? This cannot be dismissed with the clever excuses of those in charge. It must be known that the support of the people is the greatest touchstone for the success or failure of governance. Seeing that the government claims to suppress commodity prices, but commodity prices increase instead, and even when prices occasionally fall, they do not fall by even one-tenth of the amount, but the amount of increase is tens or hundreds of times more. I remember Han Yu said, "It's warm in winter, but the children cry of cold; it's a good harvest year, but the wives weep from hunger." May I ask, who caused this? Corrupt and exploitative officials, on the other hand, spend thousands of dollars every night without caring, indulging in extravagance and dancing and singing, unaware of the wartime situation. And the poor people, on the other hand, live a life of a hundred deaths and one survival, working hard all year round, and still cannot make ends meet. Is this the way to revive the nation? Therefore, I hope that the government authorities will make the stability of people's livelihood and the elimination of corruption the first principle, and thoroughly correct selfish thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>How the People Should Cooperate</p>
<p>The above is about the government. Now I will state three points for the people:</p>
<p>Understanding the Significance of the Era, and Supporting the Government—In this difficult and extraordinary period, in addition to absolute trust in and obedience to the government, the people must fully understand that the current great era is an era of absolute long-term war. Not only must we contribute everything, but we must also prepare to sacrifice everything for the long term, with a spirit of not fearing hardship and regarding death as returning home, in order to seek co-existence and co-prosperity. We must completely eliminate selfish thoughts, and speculation and hoarding are fundamentally not what the people should do at this time. On the one hand, we must strive to increase production, and on the other hand, we must practice extreme frugality. This is a critical moment of life and death, and also a crucial moment for the revival of China!</p>
<p>Changing to a New National Concept—After the end of this World War, East Asia and Europe will be rebuilt with a new order. Therefore, China's current participation in the war is not only a declaration of war against Britain and the United States, but also an expression of China's desire to occupy a place in the rebuilding of a new world order. Therefore, the old, narrow national concept is no longer suitable for the times. Only with the spirit of East Asia sharing life and death can we achieve the reality of East Asian co-existence and co-prosperity. Broadly speaking, the decision of victory or defeat in war mainly depends on whether the spirit of national sacrifice is strong or not. The so-called modern warfare is a war of national morality, which is why. Therefore, I hope that the Chinese people will all be determined to share life and death, work together to win the final victory, and then revive the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Raising Awareness of the Supremacy of the Nation—Due to the cultural aggression of Britain and the United States, the Chinese people have become victims of material civilization, misunderstand the liberalism and narrow nationalism, and their national consciousness has become extremely blurred. Therefore, China is now in the process of eliminating the inferior traits of the British and Americans in the past, and is standing on the same front with Japan with an independent and free position. It should be known that the Japanese people are all loyal believers in nationalism, that without a nation, there are no people. The people are willing to contribute all their property and even their lives to the nation, and the nation will never deceive its people, just like parents loving their children, being kind and protecting their citizens. I sincerely hope that the Chinese people will also have this concept and become the cornerstone of reviving the nation.</p>
<p>In short, the government and the people working together to revive the nation are related and not separate. Moreover, in the Republic of China, sovereignty rests with the people, and the government authorities are also part of the people. The people, deeply regretting the past thirty-one National Days, should deeply regret abandoning their responsibilities. For the present plan, we must stand firm, not fear hard work, take responsibility, and first seek the realization of peace, and then engage in the strategy of working together to revive the nation. In this way, we will not fail Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the martyrs. May a bright and glorious Republic of China shine in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere one day. This is my infinite hope.</p>
<h3>Accomplish China's Revival, Strive for Production and Construction</h3>
<p>— Takenouchi Fumio</p>
<p>Every year on Double Ten Day, we who love China are often intoxicated by the dream of memories.</p>
<p>Deeply etched in my heart, President Li Yuanhong, a revolutionary with great merit, gave me a large plaque that reads: "Boundless radiance - Presented to Mr. Takenouchi, Li Yuanhong." It records the thirty-three years of overlapping dreams of the revolution, unsparingly painted as a panorama of the ever-changing, whirlwind-like history since the first revolution. That plump-faced Li Yuanhong, who always had the warm face of a loving father; that Father of the Nation Sun Wen, who went north to Beijing in the twelfth year of the Republic with hope for cooperation between Duan Qirui and Zhang Zuolin, the tense situation when welcoming him at Beijing Station; that Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek of the National Revolutionary Army in the sixteenth year of the Republic, who drove straight in with the momentum of a broken bamboo, swept across the Jiangnan area, and granted an audience from the top floor of a building in the French Concession of Shanghai, with a firm will - the May Thirtieth Incident that once turned Shanghai into a dead city, etc. The many revolutionary stories are all breathing and reviving in my mind. Thinking about it, it has been a long thirty-three years.</p>
<p>October 10th of the third year of Xuantong, the first revolution that broke out in Wuchang, was the start of the long-sleeping "Chinese monster" moving towards "New China". If it is said that this start towards New China is the essence of the first revolution, then I believe that the Greater East Asia War is precisely what promises the completion of this Chinese revolution. Why do I say this? The goal of the Chinese revolution, internally, lies in destroying the Manchus and reviving the Hans, and establishing a republican democracy. Externally, it lies in abolishing unequal treaties and restoring an independent sovereign state. Its internal goal was roughly completed in the first revolution, and its external goal, with the Greater East Asia War as an opportunity, and due to Japan's initiative and the exchange of diplomatic relations, is quickly entering the final period of success. Japan's policy towards China, announced on January 9 of this year, stipulated the abolition of the two major pillars of China's unequal treaties - extraterritoriality and the handover of concessions. Now the power of taxation has been recovered by China, and the concessions have also been completely handed over. Not only that, but Prime Minister Tojo has also stated that he will revise the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, and China's becoming a completely sovereign state is imminent. In this way, China's dawn will soon arrive, and Father Sun Wen's lament that "the revolution has not yet succeeded" will become a thing of the past, and we will move towards the historical and inevitable path of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity.</p>
<h3>The Way to Wealth and Military Strength</h3>
<p>Speaking of "How Should the Chinese Government and People Cooperate to Revive the Nation", I am reminded of two things in my memory. One is "Five Urgent Tasks for Japan at Present" by Kanda Takahira, the pioneer of Western economics in Japan; the other is the far-sighted plans for the construction of the great air force of military Germany. Let me start with the former first.</p>
<p>Kanda Takahira and Fukuzawa Yukichi were both pioneers in introducing modern economics from abroad in Japan. Eight years before the Meiji Restoration (1868), that is, in the first year of Bunkyu, they had already advocated "Establishing the Country Through Commerce and Industry". In the first year of Meiji, he put forward "Five Urgent Tasks for Japan at Present", detailing them as follows. The five tasks are the essence of nation-building.</p>
<p>Japan should be a permanently independent country and should never be subordinate to other countries.</p>
<p>To make Japan independent, it is necessary to strengthen national power accordingly.</p>
<p>To strengthen national power, the country must be united.</p>
<p>To make the country united, the people should completely obey the government's politics.</p>
<p>To make the people obey the government's politics, the government should widely adopt domestic public opinion and should never be confined to one view.</p>
<p>Mr. Kanda Takahira put the essence of nation-building and the secret of national governance into the above five items, and from the beginning he advocated realizing these five requirements, which are the independence of the country, the enrichment of national power, national unity, the people's trust in politics, and respect for public opinion in politics. If these five items can be completed, then the country will reach the realm of "sufficient food, sufficient military, and the people trust it" as Confucius said, and the rulers will be able to reach the realm of "If the people are sufficient, who will the ruler be insufficient with? If the people are insufficient, who will the ruler be sufficient with?" And open up the world of "politics is correctness." With unity between the government and the people, the ideal country of wealth and military strength can be completed here.</p>
<p>When the author reviews the current situation in China today with these five items, he cannot help but feel a sense of "Not yet!" and cannot but sigh that today's obligations are greater than this. Liang Qichao, the "Chief of Chinese Journalism," has a section in his "Chinese Soul" that discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the Han people:</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Lack of public morality, lack of national thought, lack of a spirit of active enterprise, etc.</p>
<p>Strengths: Skilled in self-government, with a nature of adventure and independence, skilled in learning, and with a comprehensive way of thinking, etc.</p>
<p>The teachings are words that China and we cannot help but feel are relevant.</p>
<p>Eiichi Shibusawa, the highest leader in the Japanese business world during the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa periods, sighed about the decline of politics and pointed out: "Politics is neither power nor art. Politics clearly cannot be other than virtue. This is the foundation of politics." He advocated the unity of politics and virtue, considering it the utmost importance, and inheriting the true meaning of Confucius's saying "politics is correctness". However, politics is not passive or negative. Politics is often dynamic. That is often active and enterprising, and must have sufficient guidance to make the people unite. Furthermore, this guidance must be rational and enlightened.</p>
<p>Moreover, politics takes the people as its object. Therefore, the government's guidance is definitely not directed at one person only. On the government side, politics is the concrete manifestation of the policies that run in parallel with the virtue of gathering the hearts of the people. On the people's side, there must be a conscious obedience to politics and an induced spontaneous cooperation, and there must be a national organization and training with a state of vigorous vitality from the bottom up. Establishing a national organization through this kind of clear guidance of politics and the Baojia system, the New People's Movement, and youth training is the first task of China today, and it will become the dividing line between China's future rise and fall. Uniting China's 450 million people into a solid community cannot but be said to be the most important task in opening up China's current situation. And the center of this is the unity of China, Japan, and Manchuria. Moreover, what is to be demanded of the National Government at this time is that the government should match the psychology of the Chinese people. It goes without saying that they should clearly recognize that the guidance from the top down is greater than the demands from the bottom up. The National Government must stand on this understanding and sense of responsibility, grasp this grand worldview, listen to Mr. Wang Jingwei's leadership, mobilize all the Chinese people, and China and Japan must support each other and devote all their efforts to defeating Britain and the United States and establishing the great cause of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity.</p>
<h3>Understanding Industrial Revolution</h3>
<p>Next, I will introduce a story about Germany's quick and decisive construction of a large air force. The great cause of Germany's construction of a large air force did not come from a boastful and arrogant nature, but from a sober reflection on the state of the country, and was based on Hitler's intelligent reason and decisive judgment. I will briefly describe a piece of history:</p>
<p>Hitler's German regime was established in 1933. After the establishment of the regime, Hitler immediately devoted himself to the great cause of building the nation through military strength, determined to create the world's number one air force.</p>
<h3>Continuing from Number One</h3>
<p>At that time, Germany was restricted by the treaty and did not have the right to possess an air force. Therefore, aircraft manufacturing was still rudimentary, and the technology and materials were not abundant. Hitler sought resources from the United States, which was the most advanced in the world at the time, and recruited American technicians.</p>
<p>Before 1933, there were sporadic purchases from the United States, but it was not until 1933 that substantial purchases began. Engines were purchased from Pratt &amp; Whitney in the United States, and propellers were bought from Hamilton Standard. Electrical instruments for aircraft were also purchased from the United States. In addition, to initiate large-scale aircraft production, study groups were sent, and American technicians were recruited. Consequently, these resources and technologies, combined with the tireless research and ingenious inspiration of German scholars and technicians, surpassed even the United States. This was demonstrated in the recent war, where advancements in quality and quantity were astonishing.</p>
<p>What lessons does this German experience offer to China? Probably many! The most important point should be self-awareness, humility, and rational handling of matters! As mentioned earlier, China, due to the First Revolution, began to "promote the construction of a New China," and the Greater East Asia War predetermined the "completion of a New China." However, this great undertaking of building a New China is not easily accomplished. It cannot be achieved through empty words, telegrams, self-deception, superficiality, or exaggeration. It requires unity between officials and the people, nationwide consensus, and a fully mobilized national system. With appropriate guidance from the government and the self-motivated efforts of the people, it is possible. Furthermore, since China's new construction prioritizes economic development, and after the economic blockade from heavily relied-upon Britain and the United States, the nation can only use European rationality, national strength, and a clear understanding that it is part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It must be aware of its responsibilities to ultimately achieve what some call a "conceptual industrial revolution." There is absolutely no other way.</p>
<p>Okubo Toshimichi, a great statesman of early Meiji Japan, said at the "Encouragement of Industry Exposition" in Meiji 7 (1874): "The strength of a nation depends on the wealth of its people, and the wealth of its people depends on the abundance of its products. The abundance of products originates from whether the people's industry is developed... After detailed study and consideration, in accordance with the people's temperament and the level of their knowledge, establish regulations, promote industry and increase production, so that no one is idle and no one suffers from poverty." With a strong intention to enrich the country and strengthen its military, boundless ambition, and the spirit of splitting mountains, he attempted to accomplish this. To realize the great cause of a conceptual industrial revolution in China, China should emulate Germany's accurate self-assessment in the aviation industry, pursuing construction alongside war.</p>
<p>The Buddhist saying goes, "This is a difficult task, so one should make a great vow." Amidst the difficult situation of constructing while waging war, to build a New China and complete its fundamental conceptual industrial revolution is truly a great undertaking, a grand endeavor that requires a great vow to succeed. The author believes that if the ruling and opposition parties of allied China realize the significance of the Chinese situation, recall the lessons of Japan's Meiji Restoration, and learn from Germany's construction of a great air force, then with accurate self-awareness, they should steadily advance on the path of building a New China. China's destiny holds the potential to soar like a dragon awaiting its moment in the sky.</p>
<p>In short, the key to the Chinese government and people working together to revive the nation lies in the government's self-awareness of the need for top-down guidance in building a New China, and in the people establishing a complete national organization. (Translated by Song)</p>
<h3>Striving for Victory in War</h3>
<p>— Yoshiichi Oyama</p>
<p>To the question, "How should the Chinese government and people cooperate to revive the nation?" I dare to answer simply: with a firm mindset, the government and the people must unite and engage in the war with burning enthusiasm. Only in this way can the nation be restored, and the people prosper.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, it has already been ten months since the establishment of the New China. During this period, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, the wartime system has been gradually reorganized, which we have witnessed. However, in terms of both material and morale, we cannot yet say that a decisive battle system has been established.</p>
<p>Correcting National Thought</p>
<p>To speak frankly, the attitude of the people in this war still raises doubts.</p>
<p>For example, the hoarding incident. If people could truly recognize the difficult situation the nation is facing and consider the interests of the entire nation, then there would be no such selfish actions.</p>
<p>However, the occurrence of such unfortunate events is not solely the responsibility of the people. The government's responsibility in creating the opportunity for such events to occur must also be questioned.</p>
<p>After the recovery of the concessions, Chairman Wang emphasized the need to establish a central ideology. Everyone should have the will of the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Any psychological toxins from British and American ideologies should be thoroughly eliminated, and there should be an independent Chinese thought. Only with a firm ideology can the most important work that Chinese officials and people should be doing now be achieved.</p>
<p>We are currently at war. This war is for the people of East Asia, to protect East Asia. If we think that this war is for our own sake, then that is a big mistake. We must understand that this war is for the sake of our descendants, to establish a long-term plan for the East Asian people. We should think about what will happen to our descendants if we surrender now. In this regard, the destinies of China and Japan are inseparable. We must recognize the true spirit of shared life and death, and work together to strive for victory.</p>
<p>Establishing a Decisive Battle System</p>
<p>If this spirit can be conveyed to the people so that they can understand it, then feelings of discontent and dissatisfaction will naturally be resolved. To thoroughly instill this spirit, the government should implement all necessary measures. It should act with integrity and protect the people. If any unjust incidents occur, they should be investigated without hesitation to eliminate all bad elements. Only with this attitude can the government's authority be implemented, the people's hearts be won, and the nation's independence and autonomy be secured.</p>
<p>I believe that the method for both resisting foreign enemies and subduing internal enemies lies in this. If we can make the people in the peaceful areas understand the meaning of the war and establish a true decisive battle system, then I am certain that the people under the rule of Chongqing will naturally return, realize the folly of brothers fighting each other, and abandon the humiliating position of being British and American dogs. For the sake of the East Asian people, I believe they will rise up one day. To make that day come sooner, I sincerely hope that the officials and people under the rule of the National Government should establish a seamless system with no division. (Translated by Qi Qing)</p>
<h3>The Mission of New China</h3>
<p>— Takaaki Yokota</p>
<p>There are roughly three ways in which the Chinese government and people should cooperate to revive the nation:</p>
<p>Abandon weapons and implement comprehensive peace.</p>
<p>At the time of the unfortunate Sino-Japanese War, both China and Japan had extremely deep misunderstandings. One misunderstanding led to another, causing both countries and peoples to embark on the wrong path, resulting in increased misfortune. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Chinese leaders believed that "Japan is relying on military force to invade Chinese territory and sovereignty," so they wanted to resist Japan.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Japan believed that "China is dependent on Britain and the United States, and is allied with them, attempting to obstruct the development of Japan's national destiny," so it took up arms. It resolutely punished Chiang Kai-shek, the former leader of China, for "acting on behalf of Britain and the United States against East Asia."</p>
<p>However, the six years of unfortunate war have shown that Japan has no intention of infringing upon Chinese territory and sovereignty. Japan is now returning the concessions to the National Government, abolishing extraterritorial rights, respecting China's sovereignty and responsibility, and striving for China's national independence and ethnic self-strengthening, which shows that Japan has no ambitions whatsoever.</p>
<p>Major General Tanihagi also clearly stated to Chongqing: "The purpose of resisting Japan has already been achieved. China's independence and autonomy have been secured. Let us turn hostility into friendship and resolve matters with joy." The reason for resisting Japan, which arose from misunderstanding, has long been eliminated. Therefore, the Chinese people should first know that there is no reason to resist Japan. There is nothing more meaningless than consuming national strength in a meaningless resistance. If we think about not only its meaninglessness but also its great danger, then this war should be stopped immediately. The Chinese and Japanese peoples are the two leading peoples of East Asia. Waging unreasonable war against each other and consuming our own strength is tantamount to leading all Asians to self-destruction, which is truly unacceptable and should be avoided.</p>
<p>Abandon Dependence on Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, Chiang Kai-shek has relied on Britain and the United States to oppose Japan, accepting military and financial assistance. However, it must be recognized that Britain and the United States' aid to Chongqing harbors the sinister conspiracy to place China under their control. In other words, in order to eliminate Japan's invasion, China has instead led the wolves into the house, inviting the predatory hands of Britain and the United States, resulting in a situation where it cannot control its own destiny. In this war, if the Allied Powers win, Britain and the United States' control over China will inevitably increase, making China want to cry but unable to. Chiang Kai-shek's faction still claims that if the Allied Powers win this war, China's independence can be achieved and democratic politics can be realized. However, very few Chinese people believe this, and it is definitely not going to happen.</p>
<p>Why is this? Because Britain and the United States' goal in the war is to dominate the world, so it is absolutely impossible for them to unconditionally recognize China's independence and autonomy after the war. The surrender of the Italian fascist regime proves the sinister intentions of Britain and the United States. Once they seize the greatest power in the world, they will never consider China's demands and the ideals of the Chinese people. On the contrary, it can be determined that they will neglect and trample on them. Moreover, causing China to kneel before the power of Britain and the United States is not only a misfortune for China, but also the greatest misfortune for the entire nation of 400 million people in East Asia. We only need to think about what Britain and the United States have done in China for the past hundred years since the Opium War to understand this. No, not only China has been poisoned by them, but also India, Vietnam, Thailand, Java, and the Philippines have been bullied by Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. Thinking about this, we cannot help but shudder. And now China is about to repeat the same mistake. Only now must China break free from the delusion of dependence on Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Support Japan</p>
<p>The East Asian peoples are, after all, East Asian peoples. No matter how close Chiang Kai-shek is to Churchill and Roosevelt, the Chinese people are, after all, East Asian peoples, and they cannot always coordinate with Britain and the United States. How can they combine with Britain and the United States? Because Britain and the United States claim that white people are a superior race and have the ambition to conquer the world, a comprehensive integration of Britain and the United States with the East Asian peoples is absolutely impossible. Even if Chiang Kai-shek's wish comes true in this World War and the Allied Powers win, the Chinese people will undoubtedly be conquered by Britain and the United States in the next stage. Therefore, the victory of Britain and the United States in this war cannot fundamentally solve the East Asian problem. The fundamental solution to the East Asian problem must be the unity of the East Asian peoples to liberate themselves and establish the status of the East Asian countries. To achieve this, there is no other way than to unite and work hard with Japan as the center. For six years, we have been dealing with the Sino-Japanese Incident, and since December 8th, we have been fighting a large-scale war against Britain and the United States. Especially at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, we achieved a world-shocking victory, and are currently securing a vast resource zone in the southwestern Pacific, continuing to advance the war. This proves how strong Japan's national power is. In terms of excellent weapons and scientific progress, it is by no means inferior to Britain and the United States. Doesn't this prove that it is superior in every aspect? The Chinese people can now naturally recognize that Japan's strength exceeds the world's standards. It is clear that Japan can guide the entire Asian people and has the strength to establish the status of the Asian countries in the world. Only now must China abandon the mistaken psychology of dependence on Britain and the United States, take Japan's strength as the center, and establish a genuine strategy for solving the Asian problem. In other words, China must devote all its efforts to supporting Japan so that Japan can win the final victory in this war. What Chairman Wang called shared life and death is the only way to strive for national revival. There is no other way for China to survive. (Translated by Qi Qing)</p>
<h3>The Great Path to China's Revival</h3>
<p>— Toraji Kurimoto</p>
<p>The ancient Chinese sages said: "Cultivate oneself, regulate one's family, govern one's state, and bring peace to the world." The Japanese people take this as their most precious motto, reciting it morning and evening, and practicing its teachings diligently. Because the Japanese believe it to be a great and enduring classic. All nations seeking revival, their people must first cultivate themselves and regulate their families, and those in power must win the hearts of the masses and selflessly govern the state. In this way, the state will be well-governed and the world will be at peace. Therefore, the motto "cultivate oneself, regulate one's family, govern one's state, and bring peace to the world" can truly be said to be the foundation for China's national revival.</p>
<p>Therefore, officials who administer politics should be honest and just, and cherish their self-respect. The people should each be loyal to their duties, and the hearts of the officials and the people should be united, and they should be loyal to the nation. Moreover, officials and people alike should cultivate a spirit of respecting and valuing the nation, making it worthy of respect. Therefore, one should correctly recognize that even small matters can affect the nation and society. Consequently, everyone should ensure that in any situation, they do not forget the nation. If each person thinks that only they are doing this, it will not have a great impact, nor will there be great harm, and therefore, if everyone does not strive in their own position, then the society will probably be completely messed up. The nation's revival will be distant and hopeless, and the nation's power will decline day by day. Therefore, each person should constantly consider self-cultivation in every action, which is the greatest contribution to cooperating in the nation's revival.</p>
<p>We do not want to criticize the Chinese national character here, nor do we intend to point out the shortcomings of the Chinese people. Nor do we observe China subjectively from the position of Japan and the Japanese people. However, we want to honestly state our own achievements for cooperative reference.</p>
<p>The Application of Patriotism</p>
<p>It can be fully acknowledged that most Chinese people today are filled with ardent patriotism. However, upon detailed examination, their definition of patriotism is very different from ours, which leads to various questions. Although the politics of Chongqing verbally shout patriotism, are their actions not contrary to true patriotism? If they still believe that their actions are truly patriotic, then their so-called definition of patriotism, from the perspective of Eastern morality, cannot but be said to be a mistaken idea. If Chongqing's politics truly started from a genuine love of the country, the state of China would not be as it is today. Nor would it have reached the point where we have to loudly call for the revival of the nation! So, what is the reason for the flaws in Chongqing's politics? It is actually disguised patriotic politics. The actions of Chiang Kai-shek's faction all originate from private interests and desires, and can be said to be driven entirely by private desires.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if they venerate Chiang Kai-shek as a hero and great man, treating this as the expression of the Chinese people's patriotism, and believe that this is the patriotism produced after educating the youth, this is also extremely erroneous. It cannot but be said to be a low-key and inflammatory patriotic education. In this sense, the Chinese people must know what true patriotism is. Only then can it be said to be the first and foremost method for cooperating in the revival of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>With the cultivation of correct patriotism, politics can become honest and just, and good politics will produce a good society. If a good society can be produced, there will be a good economy. If a good economy is in place, the people's hearts will be at ease, and it is believed that this can promote genuine national revival.</p>
<p>Improving Education Methods</p>
<p>The Chinese people are inherently different from other uncivilized people, being a people who teach, learn, and practice what they learn. This has been proven in history. The source of morality is truly in China. Therefore, today's Chinese politics should begin with correct patriotic education. To speak boldly, among the Chinese people seen in all situations in China today, although there are indeed respectable people, when observed from the perspective of the nation, the teachings of Confucius and Mencius have been swept away. This is undoubtedly due to the laxity of education. In the Chinese education world after the revolution, there is nothing to be admired in terms of tangible aspects, but in terms of intangible aspects, it can be said to be completely erroneous inflammatory education of patriotism. Most of the people in China today who hold the most sound ideas are probably those who have received the teachings of the sages. The private school education more than thirty years ago, where teachers were hired in families, was still superior. When we consider the past and look at the present, we cannot help but feel deeply moved. The promotion of correct education is currently an urgent task and one of the major strategies for cooperating in the nation's revival.</p>
<p>In the current Chinese political world, there are very few people who are familiar with the world situation. Therefore, the judgment of changes in the situation, whether in the government or among the people, seems to be very slow. As a result, their will is often wavering, and it is difficult to have a fixed belief. This becomes the reason for being misled by rumors, and there is a very strong tendency to actually enjoy believing these rumors. Especially after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, among the educated classes in China, many people were straddling Chongqing and Nanjing, taking a wait-and-see attitude. This attitude is because everyone lacks certainty, and as a result of lacking certainty, there is not only no driving force to promote the revival of the Chinese nation, but there is also a very negative tendency. Internally, even if the country can be managed well, if there is no strong assistance from friendly allied nations externally, it will be very difficult to achieve the goal of national revival. In today's world, it is meaningless to not maintain international relations. External relations should increasingly become harmonious and friendly. Any nation that engages in perfidy will only perish. Hasn't the recent perfidious behavior of the Italian fascist regime illustrated this? Trustworthiness is the great power of national revival. Therefore, internally, the unclear atmosphere of the political world should be clarified, the two-legged policy (in the stock exchange) of the intellectual class should be abandoned, and active support should be given to the Nanjing government. The Wang regime should be trusted, and more effort should be put into strengthening political power, and relations with allied nations should be further strengthened. Especially in Shanghai, at this time, a decisive step should be taken to build a foundation for the integration of politics and economics, which is an important matter for cooperating in the nation's revival.</p>
<p>The Purge of the Economic World</p>
<p>The purge of the economic world is a necessary condition for the revival of the Chinese nation. When a good economic world appears, it is the period when speculative bad elements become extinct. If this is taken lightly, then China's national revival will be impossible. Focusing all efforts on eliminating these bad elements will greatly contribute to the cause of national revival.</p>
<p>Most of the constituent elements of Chinese society are farmers. Agriculture can be said to be the foundation of the nation. Moreover, nothing is as easily influenced by natural conditions as agriculture. Although it may be said to be guaranteed, once it is hit by wind and rain, everything is taken away. The farmers who bravely cultivate the farmland without regarding this greatest danger as a danger can truly be said to be China's national treasure. However, the rampant exploitation of farmers through illegitimate means, and the use of agricultural products as objects of speculation by speculative elements, is an intolerable crime. It is a truly evil existence. Especially in the current situation of participating in the war in China, it is precisely the time when we must respect the rural economy, treat farmers favorably, and make them strive to increase production. The evil speculators and hoarders who exhaust and impoverish them must be completely eliminated. Moreover, businessmen should fulfill their true commercial mission, which is also a great help to the nation's revival.</p>
<p>To summarize what has been said above, if all the people of the nation do not have a spirit that transcends patriotism and the consciousness of a patriot, then the above-mentioned concrete methods of cooperation may not necessarily be able to achieve the nation's revival.</p>
<p>Today, participating China is eagerly awaiting such patriots.</p>
<p>The expansion of industrial production, the communication and exchange of commerce, the smooth adjustment of finance, the strengthening and soundness of finance, and the universal accessibility of good governance all depend on the spirit of patriotism. Therefore, the first step in reviving the nation lies in the cultivation of the people, and the last lies in the spirit of patriotism. (Translated by Xiang)</p>

<h3>On the Understanding of a Prerequisite for China's Rejuvenation</h3>
<p>— Masao Kawasaki</p>
<p>The world war situation is now moving towards the final decisive stage, with increasingly fierce battles unfolding. When discussing the topic requested by the Shen Bao from readers, "How should the Chinese government and people cooperate to rejuvenate the nation?" I believe that considering the character of the Greater East Asia War within this world war, or the attitude China should adopt towards it, as irrelevant would make examination impossible. Therefore, before discussing how the government and people should cooperate to rejuvenate the nation, I will briefly outline my views on this prerequisite point.</p>
<p>Examining War from a Historical Perspective</p>
<p>First, in examining the character of this world war, we must trace the analysis of the problem back to the world economic crisis of 1929. Why do I say this? Because this was a turning point where the opposition between Anglo-American capitalist imperialism and rising nations like Japan, and China, which was in the process of forming a modern nation-state, became increasingly obvious, ultimately leading to the current war. The world economic crisis of 1929 led various countries seeking to escape the crisis towards economic nationalism. In July 1932, Britain held the British Empire Economic Conference in Ottawa, drastically strengthening economic ties within the British Empire and closing its doors to other countries. The United States, taking the Seventh Pan-American Conference in December 1933 as an opportunity, strengthened ties between North and South America and began implementing the Monroe Doctrine. In this way, with Britain and America as their pioneers, world economic blocs adopted extreme exclusionary policies. For example, the World Economic Conference held in London in July 1933 was originally intended to correct this direction of economic nationalism in the world, but due to opposition from the United States based on selfish interests, it ultimately closed without achieving anything, which is one example. At that time, Colonel House, who was active as President Wilson's confidant, advocated a "re-division of colonies," wanting to rationally re-divide the colonies monopolized by two or three countries and place them under a new world order. Also, the French statesman Briand advocated a "United States of Europe" theory, wanting to economically rebuild all European nations. These were all attempts to avoid the looming crisis of a world war and manifestations of a tendency to correct the status quo as a preventative measure. Anglo-American capitalist imperialism completely ignored this tendency and single-mindedly moved towards strengthening economic nationalism, regarding it as a process of economically dominating the world. Strictly speaking, this tendency was already contained in the Versailles peace mechanism, a legacy of the First European War, through which Britain, France, and America attempted to dominate the world and suppress emerging nations. It was the world economic crisis of 1929 that forced Britain and America, which verbally promoted idealism, to completely remove their masks and most blatantly reveal their ambitions to economically control the world. We emphasize the world economic crisis of 1929 for this reason. Since then, this tendency has intensified, ultimately leading to the outbreak of the current world war. A certain commentator once pointed out: "The countries maintaining the status quo, such as Britain, America, and France, whether at the International Disarmament Conference or in the form of the League of Nations at least in name, restricted the other countries, while forcibly demanding a world peace mechanism based on them, and at the same time strengthening their own economic groups, desperately trying to complete economic armament. The emergence of Britain's all-party coalition cabinet and its policies, President Roosevelt's inauguration in the United States and the implementation of the New Deal, the organization of France's European gold standard bloc, and the conclusion of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty, all fully illustrate this tendency. Therefore, in the international trends after the world economic crisis, internationalism was a superficial facade, while its true content was acute nationalism. If one wants to clarify the responsibility for the global war, it is this undercurrent of nationalism." We completely agree with this. The occurrence of the Manchurian Incident, the emergence of Nazi Germany and its withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference, the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, and that country's withdrawal from the League of Nations were all produced by the economic nationalism of Britain, France, and America. We view the accumulation of these events as the reason for the outbreak of the world war and the occurrence of the Greater East Asia War, its nature being the struggle of the demand for national survival rights against Anglo-American economic imperialism.</p>
<p>Analysis of the Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>If we analyze the nature of the Greater East Asia War in this way, then we cannot but discuss the basic issue under discussion in this article—Sino-Japanese relations. First, from Japan's standpoint, since the Meiji Restoration, through the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the First World War, Japan's national fortune has been rising steadily, and its population has been expanding rapidly. The popularization of domestic education and the rapid development of industry are facts that everyone already knows. In land-scarce Japan, this inevitably required securing enough food to maintain the expanding surplus population, obtaining the military resources needed to defend itself against Anglo-American domination of the world, and promoting trade, which was essential for the smooth import of these foods and resources. This demand was an absolute condition for Japan to maintain its survival. However, as mentioned above, Britain and America, which monopolized the world's resources and markets, closed their doors to Japan, a tendency that has been particularly pronounced since 1929. Therefore, in order to maintain its survival, Japan had no choice but to seek various methods. It has had an even deeper concern for China, which has a vast land and population and remains temporarily outside the Anglo-American economic group as its only market. Therefore, Japan's advance into China was a natural demand made for the sake of national survival and had no meaning of aggression. This is completely different from the capital imperialist behavior of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, which already possess many resources and colonies but, under the ambition to dominate the world, want to place China under their suppression. Many people in China have criticized Japan's China policy, but they have not considered that Japan's China policy is fundamentally not based on aggressive intentions but is implemented based on the real desire to find a way out for the nation.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation in China, the feudal political form with thousands of years of history is also in the process of collapsing due to the washing of the times. After the First, Second, and Great Revolutions, the formation of a nation-state has gradually progressed. Japan, which has been trapped under the oppression of Britain and the United States for a long time, welcomes the growth of the Chinese nation as a comrade in defending East Asia in principle. However, the process of forming a Chinese nation-state does not necessarily coincide with Japan's expectations. Especially when the first unified government in China, which can at least be said to have been established on a certain basis of national consciousness, that is, the Nanjing government, was established, it was regrettable that it compromised with Britain and the United States rather than coordinating with Japan, and the foundation of the government was based on this policy, taking a policy of distant friendship and close attack. Therefore, since the establishment of the former Nanjing government, Sino-Japanese relations have often been unsatisfactory, and Chiang Kai-shek also wanted to consolidate the foundation of his nation-state by arousing anti-Japanese feelings among the people. This explains the fact that since the increasingly fierce People's United Front since 1935, although he knew that the CCP was manipulating it behind the scenes and had to suppress it, he also promoted their anti-Japanese consciousness to consolidate his position, and he wandered between such contradictory policies. From our point of view, the occurrence of the Sino-Japanese Incident was the product of this anti-Japanese policy.</p>
<p>Now, when considering the basis of this anti-Japanese policy of the former Nanjing government, it seems that the capitalist imperialists, wearing the mask of liberalism, are playing many cunning tricks! There is a more fundamental point. The former Nanjing government could not understand that the essence of Japan's China policy was the demand for national survival, but instead, in collusion with Britain and the United States, regarded this exclusion as an act of aggression. Of course, Japan's previous China policy cannot be said to be without regrets, but there are many misunderstandings here, and that is also a fact! Moreover, the accumulation of these misunderstandings often leads to the use of force. However, what we can assert is that in the Sino-Japanese issue, no matter how many misunderstandings occur, as mentioned above, there is definitely no such thing as Japan's aggressive policy. Looking at it this way, China and Japan should have supported each other in the past, but it can be understood that unfortunate events occurred due to a lack of mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Now, because of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has liberated the vast lands and peoples of the Nanyang region, which were previously deeply closed and refused by the imperialist policies of Britain, America, and the Netherlands. In the future, Japan no longer needs to implement policies based on national demands against China. After the vast lands and peoples of Nanyang are liberated from Britain, America, and the Netherlands, the reasons for the previous misunderstandings between China and Japan no longer exist. The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, needless to say, is based on the far-reaching ideal of liberating the nations of East Asia from the shackles of Britain and the United States, and enabling each to find its place. Even from the above-mentioned Sino-Japanese relations, expelling Anglo-American imperialism from East Asia is an absolute task that China and Japan should undertake together.</p>
<p>We want to discuss the problem of cooperation with the National Government and the people under its rule, and the simple views on China's rejuvenation, but we are not afraid of verbose language to raise this prerequisite understanding because, from the current character of the National Government, if the people do not have a clear understanding of the above situation, there can be no complete cooperation, and it is meaningless.</p>
<p>Government's Reflection</p>
<p>The "peace, anti-communism, and national construction" put forward by the National Government when it returned to the capital, and which is still the basic slogan today, is something that no one disagrees with. However, the people in the peace zone cooperate with the National Government insufficiently, and are in fact handled by elements indifferent to politics. Moreover, even after the change in the new policy, the general public's impression of the government is not necessarily good. There are naturally many reasons for this, but generally speaking, it is all about the government officials' lack of integrity. At the end of September, half a year after Chairman Wang returned to the capital, he said in a speech to the Central Party Affairs Training Corps regarding the issue of integrity: "Originally, saying 'you must be honest' to an official is somewhat insulting. It is like saying to a newly married couple: You must be chaste. Isn't this too abrupt? Because without chastity, it cannot be done. Isn't dishonesty the same?" "Really, it is a great insult to say integrity to officials, but the reality is not necessarily the same as the ideal. We do not want to use the specific facts of how a certain official received gifts to explain our argument, but according to various rumors, the recent acceptance of bribes by officials is quite blatant, and there are even those who extort. Whether these things are true or false is another matter, but the credibility of such rumors in themselves is greatly related to the government. In fact, the reason why the current National Government does not receive good reviews seems to be due to this. The officialdom novel "A Record of the Appearance of Officials" in the late Qing Dynasty clearly stated the corruption of the Qing Dynasty's government. It is naturally impossible to compare the present with that time, but in today's stage of the Greater East Asia War entering the decisive stage, it is absolutely unacceptable if there are still remnants of "A Record of the Appearance of Officials." Chen Gongbo, the speaker of the Legislative Yuan, once said in his "On Honest Politics": "However, after thinking about it again, there is one more thing to do on top of the many things that need to be done urgently, that is, "establish honest politics," and I believe that honest politics is the basic condition for peace and national construction. If politics cannot be honest, peace can never be achieved, and national construction cannot be achieved," and also said: "Since the incident, many people in Chongqing have made many "national disaster fortunes" in the name of unification. People who read about these unfilial officials and unscrupulous merchants are all heartbroken. However, since we cannot bear to watch the people in Chongqing making a fortune from the national disaster there, how can we bear to stand by and watch the people under the National Government making a fortune from peace? I can't help but shout loudly to awaken our people with heart and ambition to pay attention." We also advocate, like Chen Gongbo, that the implementation of honest politics is a necessary condition for national construction. However, when examining the reasons for the corruption of these officials, it is definitely not just the simple reason of a lack of belief in peace, but also contains habitual reasons. Moreover, as the war stage progresses, life becomes more and more difficult, which is also one of the main reasons. What we hope from the government is the establishment of the strictest responsible political system. At least as far as we can see, not limited to the current National Government, in any era in China, sentiment is extremely powerful in the control of politics, which inevitably leads to the corruption of politics and thus cannot implement honest politics. Eliminating sentiment and making each official act in responsible politics cannot but be a major key to cooperation between officials and the people. Otherwise, even if the government sets up thousands of laws, it will have no effect on the improvement of politics.</p>
<p>Secondly, what should be proposed is that the government should strengthen its contact with the people. The goal of the reconstruction of the National Government is naturally peace and national construction, in other words, to save the Chinese nation from the ravages of war and stabilize it within the possible range. The interests of the government and the people are originally completely consistent, but when observing the situation from the National Government's return to the capital to the present day, is the cooperation between the government and the people in the peace zone seamless? We believe that this is not necessarily the case. All of the government's policies, even if they are appropriate subjectively and objectively, are they not often required to be mobilized by non-governmental organizations and express enthusiastic support when they are implemented? Regardless of whether it is a republican country or a totalitarian country, in any situation, the government can only smoothly implement its policies on the basis of popular cooperation. Otherwise, it is difficult to expect smooth implementation. In this regard, someone once said that even if the facts are temporarily admitted, the reality of the political and economic situation after the return to the capital is not much different from before. This is of course also a saying. However, now that the political power of the National Government is vigorously promoted after China's participation in the war, speaking of the means of cooperation with the people, and there has been no major change since the return to the capital, it is painful to realize that the National Government needs to actively consider the mobilization of the people. The New National Movement launched after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and the establishment of Chinese sovereignty due to the return of the Shanghai Public Concession, taking this as an opportunity, Chairman Wang directly exchanged opinions with Shanghai civil leaders, which is a significant manifestation of the National Government's mobilization of the people and the strengthening of civil ties. But we are not satisfied with this, and we cannot but hope for further concrete measures.</p>
<p>People's Reflection</p>
<p>Chinese people generally express an extremely negative attitude towards the emergence of new governments. This is because the form of control has changed repeatedly. Just looking at Shanghai, since the establishment of the Republic of China, there have been more than a dozen changes in the feudal forces backed by various warlords. The former Nanjing government was born under the color of anti-Japanese war, and the current National Government after the return to the capital takes cooperation with Japan as its basic policy. Therefore, from the perspective of defending themselves, rather than focusing on actively cooperating with the rulers of the times, it is extremely natural to live in the pursuit of profits. Regarding this point, it cannot but be attributed to the fact that the previous Chinese politics was not on track. At the same time, in the current situation where only three years have passed since the return to the capital, and the state of war in the country is still continuing due to the existence of the Chongqing regime's anti-Japanese policy, it is not inconceivable that the people do not immediately express active cooperation with the policies of the National Government after the return to the capital. From this point of view, we can say that the people's cooperation with the government must be given sufficient time to be most appropriate. However, from another perspective, that is, from the character of the Greater East Asia War and the state of war in which the war is being fought fiercely, this negative attitude of the Chinese people must be immediately liquidated. Without the completion of the Greater East Asia War, the independent country of China cannot exist. Therefore, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the cooperation of the current China does not allow any hesitation. The necessity of requiring the Chinese people to cooperate with the National Government is more urgent than ever before. However, when looking around our country, those civilian people who understand the spirit of this era and actively fulfill their duties as Chinese people are no more than just a futile criticism and have no effect on the regeneration of China.</p>
<p>China has been invaded by Britain and the United States for a hundred years and has become their colony. Most of its agricultural products are used as raw materials for Britain and the United States, and commercial activities have become subordinate to Anglo-American capital. However, because Anglo-American policies are extremely cunning, most Chinese people do not feel resentment towards Anglo-American economic aggression, but instead think that this is a normal phenomenon, even to this day. They rely on the economic support of Britain and the United States to China, and share some of the benefits, and feel that this is the most stable economic life. Therefore, no matter how the National Government proclaims peace and national construction, no matter how it explains the significance of the Greater East Asia War, those who speak earnestly are met with contempt, just like the east wind passing by the ear.</p>
<p>But recently, as a result of the progress of the Greater East Asia War, with Japan's assistance, China has recovered all the conduit concessions and public concessions, and Burma has already declared independence, the Philippines will soon be independent, and the nations of Nanyang are also allowed to participate in politics. Therefore, the construction of the Greater East Asia promoted by Japan has proved in fact that it is based on moral principles. In order to realize Pan-Asianism, it is necessary to first complete China's modern country. This is the path that China should take at that time. The Three People's Principles, with nationalism as the center, is for this reason. Wang Jingwei left the anti-Japanese regime in Chongqing and returned to the capital based on peace, anti-communism, and national construction. The mission of his government is also to build a modern national country. The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War is for the construction of the nation-state. At the same time, for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, China is required to cooperate actively. Here, the National Government sees the importance of joint responsibility in a sense different from Japan. At the same time, what becomes a problem, in order to form a nation-state. If the Chinese people understand this new trend in world history and abandon their previous negative attitude for the construction of a new China, then the integration of the government and the people will no longer be a problem, and the basic conditions for the construction of a completely independent China can be said to have been completed. When talking about the Chinese people, we are not just stubbornly adhering to the previous conservative attitude, but the people who are most obedient to the guidance of the government.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Speaking of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, those of us who live in countries that have long completed the modern state can understand its inevitability more easily. However, it is not without some difficulties for those in China who are on the way to completing the nation-state to understand it. Sun Yat-sen's ultimate goal, everyone admits, is the realization of Pan-Asianism. Sun Yat-sen's request is also the main topic, and it cannot but be the topic mainly based on the request to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. According to their views, needless to say, the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere should come first, and the National Government must first make full efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War. As mentioned earlier, the construction of an independent and autonomous new China can only be realized when it expels Britain and the United States, which attempt to dominate the world, from Greater East Asia, and establishes the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Even if the dream of the Chongqing regime, which is following the path of collusion with Britain and the United States, is realized, it is nothing more than treating Chongqing as one of the links in the world dominated by Britain and the United States. This is what people inside Chongqing have already admitted. Although they are competing in the progress of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere of Japan, they still do not change their anti-Japanese policy and the line of collusion with Britain and the United States because they are afraid of losing their political lives after doing so. But today, they are saying "anti-war and national construction," but they do not feel very attractive.</p>
<p>If the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere with the center can be built, then the formation of a Chinese nation-state is not a problem. The form of the United Nations of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is more important than the political concept of a country in the process of forming a nation-state. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that the formation of China's nation-state is further stimulated by the construction of the Greater East Asia. Therefore, what is required of China now is only that the government and the people work together as one and move towards the mission they are shouldering. The points mentioned in the previous "Government's Reflection" and "People's Reflection" are only one or two issues incidentally raised in completing this mission. (Translated by Yi)</p>
<h3>Understanding the Greater East Asia War for China's Rejuvenation — Kiyomasa Hidaka</h3>
<p>The war that Japan is now launching in Greater East Asia, Chairman Wang has also said that it is a war of liberation for the nations of Greater East Asia. Chairman Wang, who bears the actual responsibility for the safety of the country, thinks this way, and I believe that the intellectual class in China must also think this way. However, the degree of belief varies, but the people who form Chinese public opinion must be able to believe it.</p>
<p>If someone determines that this Greater East Asia War is Japan's war of aggression, then I dare to determine that such a person has absolutely no judgment. Why? I think that such a person may not have seen the Emperor of Japan's declaration of war, and he does not understand the policies implemented by Japan towards the various countries and nations of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>For this kind of person, I would like to offer a piece of advice:</p>
<p>"If you want to study Japan, please study the national polity of Japan before studying Japanese industry, Japanese cities, and Japanese geography. The so-called study of the Japanese national polity means that you study the tradition of the Japanese Empire for 2,600 years since its founding and the spirit of the Japanese people towards the Emperor. If you do not know the national polity of Japan, you cannot understand the Tengzheng Japan."</p>
<p>There are also experts in China who study the Japanese national polity. Although I have not heard of many, I also know that among the Chinese civilians, there is a Mr. Du Tianyi, who studies the Japanese national polity. As far as I know, ordinary foreigners study Japan, and they are finished as long as they have statistics and figures. Just imagine if you can understand Japan by relying solely on trade statistics and figures, wouldn't that be too simple?</p>
<p>The True Meaning of the Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>One hundred million Japanese people are convinced that this Greater East Asia War is the liberation war of Greater East Asia, and it is also the war in which the Japanese Empire is fulfilling its three thousand years of belief.</p>
<p>I hope that Chinese people can understand this point. If you do not understand this point clearly, then it will be difficult to understand the affairs of Greater East Asia in the future. The independence of Burma, the independence of the Philippines, the participation of Malays in politics, the participation of Javanese in politics, the assistance to the independence of India, and the implementation of the new policy towards China, I dare to determine that all these facts are ironclad evidence that the Greater East Asia War is the war of liberation of the nations of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>The Anglo-American efforts in the war are inhuman and contradictory actions; I believe that there is absolutely no one in the world who regards the Anglo-American war against Japan as a war of liberation for Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Friends and Enemies Must Be Distinguished</p>
<p>Therefore, Chongqing's cooperation with Britain and the United States in the war, in other words, is to hinder India's independence, deny Burma's independence, and want to place the various nations of Greater East Asia under the trampling of Britain, America, and the Netherlands. When the entire nation of Greater East Asia rises up to fight for liberation, only the Chongqing regime has become a traitor to East Asia. Is this the will of the military and political circles and the people of Chongqing who have knowledge and come from belief? I believe it is definitely not. Chongqing is clinging to old things and being emotional, so it is seeking its own worries.</p>
<p>The National Government, with Chairman Wang as its center, is now fighting alongside Japan. He is a powerful comrade-in-arms in the Greater East Asia War of Liberation. In order to fully exert the combat power of the new China, the government and the people should cooperate to rejuvenate the country. I think that the smart people in China are fully aware of these issues. (Translated by Qi Qing)</p>
<h3>Wuchang Uprising: The Cooperative Path Between Government and People</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>Thirty-two years ago today, October 10, 1911, the Wuchang Uprising erupted. It, like the Toba-Fushimi War during the Meiji Restoration, holds tremendous significance in world history. Both were inevitable revolutions born from historical necessity. However, the fuse that ignited the Wuchang Uprising was an accidental, odd occurrence. On that day, in the Tongmenghui branch within the Russian concession in Hankou, members were desperately, secretly manufacturing bombs. One member accidentally dropped a bomb on the floor, causing it to explode with a loud bang. Everyone in the room panicked and fled. In their haste, they even forgot to take the list of revolutionary party members. If the list had fallen into the hands of the police, they would all have been arrested and sent to the guillotine. Rather than face death, they decided to strike first, launching a military mutiny. Revolutionary party members dragged Li Yuanhong, who was terrified and trembling under his bed because of the mutiny, and declared him the "Initiator of Righteousness," forcing him to issue a revolutionary declaration. This is the historical truth of the so-called "Wuchang Uprising." However, Edwin J. Dingle, in his "China's Revolution 1911-1912," published by the Shanghai Commercial Press in 1912, described Li Yuanhong as follows:</p>
<p>(The Chinese Revolution is one of the most appalling and epoch-making events in world history. If Li Yuanhong, who is currently known to everyone worldwide, had not been present at the time, the revolution might not have erupted. History proves that only Li Yuanhong is the greatest reformer in the Chinese world. His sound policies and incorruptible virtue towards the people have enabled the new China to rapidly ascend the political stage... He is now recognized by people around the world as the most talented and only reformer of this era.) (Page 24 of the book)</p>
<p>Even if I acknowledge that Li Yuanhong was a leader of the Wuchang Revolution, to assert that he, who panicked during the mutiny and hid under his bed, is "the greatest reformer in the Chinese world" is a blatant desecration of the true meaning of the Wuchang Uprising. The Wuchang Uprising was not led by an old-fashioned military man like Li Yuanhong, but by revolutionary party members who were nameless, penniless, and filled with patriotic fervor, hoping to transform China into a modern power. It was particularly guided by a group of students studying in Japan, residing in apartments around Kanda. However, the leader of these guides, and the one who directed the Wuchang Uprising on the path it should take, was of course Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Even those who judge Premier Sun to be an outsider to the Wuchang Uprising because he was in exile abroad at the time and did not get the "opportunity to hide under a bed" must acknowledge that it was Premier Sun who clearly directed the Wuchang Uprising towards its goals: opposing feudalism and opposing imperialism.</p>
<p>The Tide of the Chinese Revolution</p>
<p>Since then, no matter how the tide of the Chinese Revolution has ebbed and flowed, it has never deviated from the two lines of opposing feudalism and opposing imperialism. Just as a pendulum, no matter how it swings left or right, always returns to the vertical. No matter which direction the Chinese Revolution temporarily attempts to take, it will always return to this central task. Opposing feudalism and opposing imperialism can be summarized as China striving for the independence and autonomy of a modern nation-state. Since the Wuchang Uprising, the Republic of China has been established in name as a modern nation-state, but the degree of national independence and autonomy is still not complete. Therefore, Chinese politics has always revolved around the issue of independence and autonomy, and the political struggles of the masses have always focused on the goals of opposing feudalism and opposing imperialism. Therefore, it can be said that a cooperative path between the government and the people has been historically determined for the Republic of China. If the government does not advance towards anti-imperialist and anti-feudal policies and seeks the cooperation of the masses, it is like trying to catch fish in green water. When the government adopts policies that harm national sovereignty and national independence, the people refuse to cooperate. This direction, it can now be said, has become an unbreakable belief among the people as a revolutionary principle of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Chinese politicians use this popular belief as the center for their political struggles. Politicians with ulterior motives often use this popular belief when attacking their political enemies. For example, they make grand pronouncements that so-and-so is colluding with foreign imperialists, betraying the interests of the Chinese nation, and is an old-fashioned traitor. Regarding national autonomy and ethnic independence,</p>
<p>Continued on page four</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>Continued from page three, people with extreme sensitivity to these things, to some extent, believe such arbitrary propaganda and come out against that person. If you think carefully about it, how many Chinese politicians have not been called traitors? Even when Premier Sun signed the Hanyeping loan agreement with Mitsui &amp; Co., the whole country was in an uproar, denouncing him as a traitor.</p>
<p>The Significance of the Establishment of the National Government</p>
<p>The Nanjing government, due to the assistance it received from Japan during its establishment, has certainly been subject to much criticism. However, there is no need to engage in杞人憂天. As long as we believe in the inherent political instinct of the Chinese nation, as long as we move forward bravely towards the direction of national independence and autonomy, then we will have no shame before heaven. Naturally, without a unified national situation, that is, without a comprehensive state of peace, China's independence and autonomy cannot be realized. Therefore, the people naturally harbor immense concern for the issue of comprehensive peace. Chairman Wang's recent statement regarding comprehensive peace is precisely a response to this concern of the people. The people will certainly say from the bottom of their hearts that they are willing to cooperate with this trend of the government.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I firmly believe that as long as Japan's policy towards China respects the Chinese nation's demands for independence and autonomy, even if it encounters obstacles in the current situation, it will surely gain the sympathy of the Chinese people in the future. However, never forget that Chongqing is constantly propagating the "Japanese policy towards China is to give China nominal benefits while taking real benefits for itself" and using this method to stimulate the self-esteem of the general public who are sensitive to independence and autonomy. Therefore, in matters such as transportation and production, even though they have already been returned to the Nanjing government, if the real power is still in the hands of the Japanese, this will provide material for Chongqing's propaganda. As a result, the Chinese people will refuse to cooperate with the Nanjing government. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to this point. At the same time, Japan must not neglect to cooperate with the Nanjing government to make it a government of a modern nation-state. For example, regarding personnel matters, if, as in the old days of monarchical autocracy, appointments are not made based on talent but on blood relations and factional ties, then this should be eliminated as soon as possible with Japan's assistance. This is by no means a matter of interfering in internal affairs. In short, as long as Japan does not violate the revolutionary principles of China, it can strive to implement it without regard to anything else.</p>
<p>However, when implementing it, Japan should once again introspect whether China's independence and autonomy as a modern nation-state are conducive to Japan's development. If Japan itself consistently does not take a step out of the narrow scope of nationalism, then the strength of its neighbor will threaten its own strength. Therefore, the so-called respect for China's independence and autonomy is clearly a self-deception. It is impossible to practice political lies on the Chinese people, who have such sensitive political instincts. Some Japanese before the Greater East Asia War held narrow-minded nationalism, but now it cannot be said that it has been completely eliminated. This is the reason why the Chinese people do not trust the Japanese.</p>
<p>Sincere Cooperation Among Asian Nations</p>
<p>However, since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, especially as the war situation intensifies today, Japan deeply feels that it must have the sincere cooperation of all Asian nations in order to defeat the enemy in the Greater East Asia War. But if Japan consistently clings to narrow nationalism, it will absolutely not be able to obtain the sincere cooperation of all Asian nations. In order to confront countries as vast as Britain and the United States, Japan must, in any case, organize the entire Asia into one vast nation. The current world, where nationalism has become the driving force of the era, is fundamentally different from the era of the Great Emperor Genghis Khan. Now, without equality between nations, there will be no joint struggle against a common enemy with shared life and death. This simple and understandable reason is especially evident in Sino-Japanese relations. If Japan can thoroughly realize this idea in Sino-Japanese relations, then the political influence on the Asian nations will be very significant. Because, judging from China's political position among the Asian nations, if the Chinese nation reconciles with Japan and sincerely cooperates with Japan, then other nations will also rise up and follow the example of the Chinese nation. This point is especially obvious in the Indian national question. Needless to say, the Indian nation is opposed to British rule. However, the reason why they still cannot fully trust Japan to fight side by side until today is because they have not yet seen sufficient evidence that Japan will not become a second Britain. This is because the Sino-Japanese War has not been satisfactorily resolved, and the attitude of the entire Chinese nation is not yet clear. If the majority of the Chinese nation is willing to cooperate sincerely with Japan, then India will immediately change its current political hesitation and cooperate with Japan, attacking from both inside and outside, driving out Britain and the United States. If China is willing to cooperate with Japan, then once India breaks away from its colonial status, world issues will be decided by Asians. From this point of view, the key to the whole Asian problem, no, the key to the whole world problem, can be said to be entirely dependent on the success or failure of dealing with this Sino-Japanese relationship. This may not be an exaggeration. However, in order to deal with Sino-Japanese relations, Japan itself must first abandon the narrow national concept and sincerely rejoice in China's freedom and independence. There is no room for deception or self-deception on this point. A modernized and strengthened China is no longer a threat to Japan, but a good partner in the Greater East Asia War. At this time, it is unacceptable to jeopardize the great issue of the rise and fall of the Japanese nation due to the idea of "rights and interests" in China. This is the new awakening of the Japanese people. What is implemented based on this national self-awareness is the "new policy" towards China, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Therefore, Japan's new policy is fully in line with China's revolutionary principles, and there should be no friction between them. At the same time, the path of cooperation between the Chinese government and the people, the path of full cooperation between Japan and China, and the path of full cooperation among all Asian nations are all in line with China's revolutionary principles and Japan's new policy. Of course, the ultimate goal is to strive for the independence and autonomy of all Asian nations through joint struggle.</p>
<p>What history has shown Japan in this regard is the Meiji Restoration, and what has shown China this direction is the Wuchang Revolution. There is no need to add more words to this! (Chinese Translation)</p>
<h3>How to Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production</h3>
<p>— Tang Shoumin</p>
<p>In recent years, prices have soared, and the livelihoods of the people have been unstable. Many commentators attribute this to the monopolies held by hoarders. Indeed, hoarding and monopolies can lead to price explosions, but there is another even more important reason, which is insufficient production. Short-term solutions should absorb idle capital, crack down on hoarding, promote frugality, and balance supply and demand. Long-term solutions still require actively promoting production. The government is now implementing controls on various major commodities and gradually implementing a rationing system for various daily necessities. In the near future, this should gradually have an effect on stabilizing prices. But if the source of supply of materials is not sustained, the rationing method will still be difficult to maintain. Therefore, the matter of actively increasing production still awaits the concerted efforts of all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Our country has vast land, abundant resources, a large population, and a moderate climate, making for very superior production conditions. Logically, there should be no phenomenon of insufficient materials. However, in the past, some agricultural and industrial products were still dependent on imports. The reason for this is purely that the industrial, financial, and technical sectors failed to closely connect and cooperate. The industrial sector lacked available funds, the financial sector had funds but did not invest them in production, and technicians had no opportunity to use what they had learned. The most important thing to do in the future is to correct past mistakes, make the financial sector the center, and strive for close cooperation in the three aspects, so as to revive the national economy and achieve self-sufficiency in production as a common goal. At the same time, it is hoped that the government can provide incentives and support for all production-increasing work, so that the progress of the work can be seen quickly and smoothly.</p>
<p>Three Prerequisites for Increasing Production</p>
<p>The center of Chinese industry is in Shanghai. To revive Chinese industry and increase industrial products, we must first start with restoring Shanghai's industry. Since the incident, the reasons for the decline of Shanghai's industry and the reduction in output are: first, the lack of raw materials; second, the limitation of power; and third, the problem of food for workers. Many factories were unable to solve the above three points, so they either reduced or stopped work, leading to an abundance of idle capital, a rush to speculate and hoard, and an inevitable increase in the number of unemployed workers. This phenomenon not only affects people's livelihoods but also harms social order and tranquility. The government is now strictly cracking down on hoarding and speculation, so that general idle capital can return to production uses, which is a great opportunity for industrial revival. It is right to work together and move towards increasing production. Some people will definitely raise doubts: the three prerequisites for industrial revival have not been resolved, factories cannot even resume normal work, so how can we talk about increasing production? In my opinion, as long as all parties believe that increasing production is absolutely necessary for China and for the entire East Asia, then it is not difficult to solve these three prerequisite problems.</p>
<p>First, the problem of industrial raw materials. In the past, the lack of raw materials was not necessarily a real lack; there were also some man-made factors. For example, inappropriate procurement methods, excessively low purchase prices, and the inability of procurement agencies to obtain the cooperation of local farmers were all reasons for poor procurement results and a lack of raw materials. Since Japan implemented a new policy towards China, canceled the monopoly purchase of Japanese business groups, and eased restrictions on the circulation of materials in various places, the results of raw material purchases have been improving day by day. Take the current situation of the Wheat Flour Professional Committee's unified purchase of wheat and the start of work at various flour mills in Shanghai as an example; is this not a clear improvement in the supply of industrial raw materials? If each industry can follow the method of the wheat flour industry, borrow large low-interest loans from the financial industry, and purchase from various major production areas in a unified manner, then the problem of raw material supply will not be difficult to solve step by step. However, when purchasing, more consideration should be given to methods and prices, and by no means should mandatory methods be adopted to make farmers fearful. This will not only affect the current purchase but also affect future production. If we can use the psychology of farmers who value physical objects, and use as many barter methods as possible within the possible range, then more satisfactory purchase results can be expected.</p>
<p>Second, the problem of electricity restrictions. The total power generation of the power plants in Shanghai is about 200,000 KVA or more. The lines between these plants have long been connected to each other for mutual feeding and regulation, so it seems that there should not be a shortage of electricity for the city's current needs. As far as we know, there are indeed many factories whose power limits are too low to allow them to operate at full capacity. However, there are also not a few factories whose original limits are too wide and are now underutilizing or not using them at all. This phenomenon urgently needs to be corrected and adjusted so that industries that truly intend to produce can develop as much as possible. If, after this adjustment, there is still a shortage of industrial electricity, then we can strictly limit the consumption of general-purpose electricity to inject industrial electricity. Alternatively, we can stop the power distribution to some industries that are not related to people's livelihood to actively supplement the deficiencies in people's livelihood industries. This matter should be jointly decided by the local administrative authorities, industrial groups, and power companies to determine a principle, and then gradually implement it according to the principle. In this way, the power problem of Shanghai's industry does not seem difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Third, the problem of workers' food. Workers are productive elements. To increase production, we must first take care of the lives of workers. Especially since the procurement of industrial raw materials will mostly require barter methods in the future, we cannot but redouble our efforts for the increase in industrial products, that is, we cannot but solve the problem of workers' lives especially first. I personally advocate that workers engaged in people's livelihood industries should be given special rations in addition to ordinary rations. If the food supply is sufficient, special rations will of course not be a problem. Otherwise, we should disperse some unemployed vagrants and use the food saved for special rations. We must not be lenient and allow rent-seekers and producers to enjoy the same treatment.</p>
<p>The above are personal opinions on increasing industrial production. As for increasing agricultural production, it is even more important than industry. First, the problem of people's livelihood urgently needs to be solved. Second, all industries cannot operate without raw materials. China was originally an agricultural country, and more than 80% of the population is engaged in agriculture. In terms of land area and the number of farmers, it should at least be able to be self-sufficient. However, now there is a phenomenon of wide-scale food and raw material shortages. This is really a great shame for every Chinese citizen. To wash away this shame, we must achieve self-sufficiency in the shortest possible time. Regardless of whether it is after this world war, countries will have no surplus capacity to export for a while, and even if they can still export, relying on others is not a long-term solution for establishing a country. We should now exhaust all possible reasons for the lack of production in the past, and then remedy them one by one.</p>
<p>The Problem of Improving Agricultural Technology</p>
<p>According to experts, the reasons for the lack of agricultural production in our country are: due to the lack of water conservancy repairs, droughts and floods immediately become disasters. Due to the lack of research on farming methods, production decreases year by year. Due to the lack of seed improvement, the quality deteriorates day by day and affects production. Due to the lack of attention to preventing insect plagues, annual losses are significant. Due to the failure to utilize barren mountains, wasteland, lakes, swamps, and marshes, profits are abandoned on the ground. However, some people think that the above problems are secondary, and the most important thing is political integrity and social order, so that farmers can live and work in peace. Then we can talk about restoring normal production, and then we can talk about increasing production. We will now set aside the political issues and focus on agricultural technology issues. I deeply feel that the following issues need to be discussed immediately.</p>
<p>The problem of farmland water conservancy. In the Jiangnan area, rice is the main product. In Jiangbei and Subei and Huai, cotton and wheat account for a large proportion. The former needs irrigation, and the latter needs to be drained. We should set up pumping stations to facilitate irrigation, or dredge rivers to facilitate drainage, depending on local conditions. Before the incident, the Construction Committee used Qiyang electric power to set up irrigation stations in Suchang, and farmers actually benefited from them. In recent years, wages have become increasingly expensive, and farmers feel the need for electric irrigation more urgently. The establishment of the aforementioned irrigation stations urgently needs to be restored and expanded as soon as possible. As for the Jiangbei river dredging project, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has also been making every effort to handle it, and it should continue to be held so as not to abandon the previous achievements.</p>
<p>The problem of improving farming. There are three aspects of farming that should be improved: (1) improving farming methods, (2) abolishing old-fashioned agricultural tools and using new-style agricultural tools, and (3) studying fertilization methods. Chinese farmers only know to stick to old methods. Not only is it difficult to change their mindset suddenly, but also the rural economy is generally declining, and it is not easy to raise a sum of money for improvement. Therefore, the competent authorities should set up more model farms in various counties, enlighten them at any time, and the financial institutions should provide loans for agricultural tools and fertilizer purchases, so that farmers are aware of the benefits of improving farming and can use loans to implement improvements.</p>
<p>The problem of improving seeds. Improving seeds can not only improve the quality of products, but also increase the yield of products. For example, cotton and wheat have both achieved considerable results in promoting improved seeds and have gained the trust of farmers. Unfortunately, since the incident, this research and promotion work has been 中, resulting in 良种籽, no way to obtain it, urgently should be the full control agency to recruit experts, continue research, promotion. In addition to cotton, wheat and rice, other agricultural products related to people's livelihood should also be expanded for research. In addition, it is more appropriate to encourage and subsidize people to set up more farms to engage in improvement research, so that the supply of improved seeds can become more popular.</p>
<p>The problem of preventing insect disasters. The problem of insect disasters is extremely common in our country. For example, the rice stem borer for rice and the black smut for wheat are as harmful as floods. However, floods are not very common, and insect disasters are not annual. In agricultural publications of Jinling University, it is estimated that the losses from insect disasters in our country amount to more than two or three hundred million yuan per year. The impact on the wealth of the people can be imagined. At the present time, we are actively promoting the increase of agricultural products. Positive aspects, such as irrigation, drainage, improved farming, and seed aspects, should be given special attention. The negative aspect of preventing insect disasters is also prepared to be abandoned, otherwise the insect disasters will spread wider and the elimination will be difficult. The method of prevention, on the one hand, should be to restore agencies such as the Insect Bureau to continue to study prevention and elimination methods. On the other hand, it is more appropriate to promote the large-scale manufacture of insecticides and supply them to farmers at low prices.</p>
<p>The problem of utilizing wasteland. There are many barren mountains, wasteland, lakes, swamps, and marshes in our country. If they can be fully utilized according to local conditions, it can also be of great benefit to increasing agricultural products. However, the character of our people is mostly happy to watch success, and it is difficult to plan with them. The monopoly work is not 嗟 can obtain immediate benefits, so it should be handled by government agencies themselves, or encourage people to organize companies to handle, and by the government thousand with interest guarantees, as well as various conveniences in the work.</p>
<p>How to Raise Increased Production Funds</p>
<p>How to raise the funds needed for increased agricultural and industrial production is also an issue that should be discussed first in this article. The intent is that industrial funds, in addition to long-term funds that should first enrich individual capital or issue company bonds, the shorter-term, more active ones are those that Shanghai commercial banks are happy to undertake, and currently the money is gradually loosening, and it seems that it is no longer a problem. In the event of a unified purchase of raw materials, when huge funds are needed, you can also follow the industry loan loan precedent, by the financial sector to organize the bank pass, co-commitment, and the Chinese bank to national bank status, as its backing. As for agricultural lending, the nature is not the flexibility of industrial and commercial lending, and it is scattered in various places, and it is not welcomed by general commercial banks, especially the medium and long-term loans, the term is longer, and it is not willing to do what general commercial banks can do. However, agricultural needs for improvement funds are actually more urgent than industry, and at the same time, agricultural production is not only related to people's food, but also has a linked relationship with industrial production, because without agricultural products, there are no raw materials, and without raw materials, industry cannot produce. In addition to this situation, there are only two ways to raise funds: the first is to handle it by the National Bank itself, or by the National Bank to provide funds, and entrust other banks to handle it, the second is to encourage general commercial banks to handle it, by the National Bank to guarantee interest, and to give them the convenience of transferring mortgages at any time when necessary. Regardless of which method is adopted, rural financial institutions such as cooperatives must first be soundly established, otherwise the organization will be loose, and there will be simply no way to start.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point, that is, to require domestic agricultural and industrial experts to use what they have learned and participate in the work of national revitalization and economic construction in unison. At a minimum, they must be able to achieve a self-sufficient level in the shortest possible time. How can this mission be accomplished? It all depends on the joint efforts of all parties.</p>
<h3>Promoting Production and Construction</h3>
<p>— Xu Guanqun</p>
<p>In this day and age, everyone seems to have awakened to the unreliability of speculation for quick profits and understands the urgency of striving for production. To meet the demands of the times and environment, on the National Day of the Republic of China's 32nd year, the Shen Bao newspaper asked me to write an article on the topic of "How to Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production." Considering my limited knowledge, I was deeply concerned that I would not be able to offer anything of substance. Therefore, I will briefly express my personal observations and limited views.</p>
<p>We all know that if China wants to achieve self-reliance, a drastic change is needed in its economic construction, transforming it from a consumer nation to a producer nation. The characteristic of China's past economy was that it could only consume and not produce, to the point that China is now called the world's largest consumer nation, which is disheartening to say. Whether in times of peace or war, no nation that only knows how to consume and not how to produce can survive in today's world. Fortunately, enlightened people in the economic world today deeply understand this principle and unanimously advocate increasing production to correct the mistake of neglecting production, which is a good sign.</p>
<p>However, simply talking about production is not enough. Regarding the question of how to increase production, we must first engage in thorough discussions and offer suggestions to get to the root of the problem. The topic for submissions announced by the Shen Bao newspaper focuses on the fundamental problem of China's production today, which lies in how to utilize China's two largest assets and resources: manpower and land. Therefore, the topic is "How to Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production."</p>
<p>Understanding Agricultural and Industrial Problems</p>
<p>When it comes to agricultural and industrial production, the emphasis is not on theory but on facts. From an economic theory perspective, the deep divide between the Physiocrats and the Mercantilists no longer exists in today's era. In other words, agricultural and industrial production are equally important. In ancient times, agriculture held a dominant position. In the autumn of the 17th century, the importance of commerce and industry increased. By the mid-18th century, agriculture regained importance. When the Industrial Revolution arose, industry surpassed all other sectors. Thus, there were times of emphasis on agriculture and times of emphasis on industry. However, the understanding of agricultural and industrial problems in the economic world today is somewhat different. Our common understanding is that the importance of agricultural and industrial production is equally significant, because both the industrial and commercial sectors must purchase raw materials from farmers, and farmers must also purchase tools and other manufactured goods from the industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, increased agricultural production can increase industrial production, and increased industrial production can also increase agricultural production.</p>
<p>However, regarding the current state of agricultural production in China, as Mr. Lin Kanghou wrote in the September issue of "Economic Herald," "As far as the current situation is concerned, the two major factors of production, manpower and land, do not seem to be a problem in our country. However, upon closer examination, there are hidden crises everywhere, which cannot help but make one frown with worry. Since the sharp rise in prices and the proliferation of black markets, the profits from black market transactions far exceed the rate of return from general legitimate businesses and are better than general wage and salary income. Since the price of rice on the black market has soared, rural farmers, regardless of age or gender, have abandoned their hoes and left their fields, spending their days carrying loads on their shoulders, traveling between urban and rural areas,贩运rice and grain, pursuing the exorbitant profits of smuggled rice. The impact on agricultural production is self-evident. Furthermore, since the price of cigarettes on the black market has sharply risen, long queues of people crowd in front of cigarette paper shops all day long, rushing to obtain rationed cigarettes for sale on the black market. This income is also much greater than ordinary wages. This phenomenon not only wastes manpower but also affects the psychology of workers, causing them to dislike production work and enjoy engaging in trafficking and smuggling. Therefore, can we not worry about the manpower and wage problems when increasing production?"</p>
<p>In view of such general crises and phenomena, I feel that there are several key issues regarding how to increase agricultural and industrial production that require our economic circles to address together. I will explain them as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding Increasing Agricultural Production:</p>
<p>Agricultural Finance Problems: Increasing agricultural production relies heavily on the regulation of agricultural finance. The agricultural loans offered by the Bank of Communications are a good example of regulating agricultural finance, because its agricultural finance business policy aims to improve the economic conditions of rural areas, increase agricultural production, assist in agricultural promotion and extension, guide farmers to establish their own financial systems and institutions with autonomy, self-management, and self-enjoyment, and support the establishment of self-cultivating farmers. I fully agree with these policies and believe that providing loans to rural areas should be expanded and promoted. The initial work should focus on rural credit and production cooperative loans, so that rural capital can circulate, improve the economic conditions of rural areas, and naturally increase agricultural production.</p>
<p>Agricultural Technology Problems: Increasing agricultural production also relies heavily on improving agricultural technology. Our country's land is not infertile, and its products are not scarce, but unfortunately, farming methods have always adhered to conventions without seeking improvement, and mechanized farming methods are still lacking. This results in the inability to increase production dramatically. In addition, there is the question of how to cultivate wasteland and how to develop low-lying marshlands. According to research, after the completion of the reclamation plan for Eastern Taihu Lake, 16,000 hectares of fertile land can be obtained, yielding 70 million dan of rice. These are all agricultural technology issues that have a significant impact on agricultural production.</p>
<p>Continued on Page 5</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Continued from Page 4</p>
<p>Problems with Agricultural Product Prices: Increasing agricultural production also depends on increasing the prices of agricultural products. The farmers’ ability to repay their debts depends on the prices of their agricultural products. If the government lowers the prices when purchasing agricultural products, farmers will lose their ability to repay their debts, and the consequences will be unimaginable, and they may even abandon their farms. If agricultural product prices are reasonably increased, farmers' income can increase, and after deducting the minimum living expenses, they can invest the remaining money into the land, gradually making land rental and cultivation more economical. Then, agricultural products can naturally increase.</p>
<p>Regarding Increasing Industrial Production:</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials Problems: "A skilled cook cannot make a meal without rice" is an old Chinese saying that is also very logical. The lifeblood of industry is raw materials. Among the many reasons for the current sluggish industrial production, the lack or depletion of raw materials is the most fatal blow. Due to transportation difficulties or blockades, imported raw materials are naturally in short supply, but we should still try our best to ensure a continuous supply of domestic raw materials. In addition, we should adhere to the principle of using local raw materials as much as possible. It is true that we cannot produce flour without wheat or cloth without cotton, but all other industrial products also have local raw materials that can be used. For example, the raw materials for alcohol are sweet potatoes and sugarcane, and the raw materials for paper are wood and bamboo, which are abundant in our local products. The question is only how to use them as much as possible? How can those that are rationed be allocated as much as possible?</p>
<p>Industrial Finance Problems: Improving financial activities is closely related to increasing productivity. In the summer of the year before last, I discussed domestic industrial finance problems with Mr. Zhu Hengquan, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, and Mr. Yi Shengbai, and I deeply felt that the domestic financial environment was not able to meet the needs of the industrial sector. Subsequently, the China Industrial Bank was established, with the goal of providing legitimate production enterprises with the funds they need and providing reasonable support. At the same time, it aims to provide the industrial sector with a practical organization to increase production, handling industrial surveys, statistics, research, design, technology, and other matters to strive for industrial production. In addition, considering that small-scale industries still occupy an important position in China's overall production volume, I also strongly support organizing them. The rise of small-scale industries is a "many grains make a heap" approach to increasing production. Therefore, in the regulation of industrial finance, it is especially necessary to revitalize small-scale industries.</p>
<p>In conclusion, under our united banner of increasing agricultural and industrial production, the people, whether they are engaged in agriculture or industry, should sweep away the old habits of extravagance and jointly grasp the key to increasing agricultural and industrial production and work hard in their respective positions. Then, the 400 million people who were originally mostly consumers can easily be transformed into 400 million producers. China's economy must undergo this drastic change in order to speak of the emergence of a new China.</p>
<h3>Increasing Agricultural and Industrial Production: Striving in Our Respective Positions</h3>
<p>— Shao Shuhua</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Our country is an agricultural producing country, and light and heavy industries are still in their infancy. Most of the people make a living from agriculture. It is estimated that out of the 450 million people in the country, about 300 million are farmers, accounting for 75% of the total population. From this, it can be seen that our country's production profession is heavily biased towards agriculture, so if we want to develop our country's economic undertakings, we should start with agriculture first. The increase in agricultural production will indirectly enable the country's economy to develop. Looking back at our country's industry, before the early 19th century, it was still a handicraft industry country. After the Opium War, China's closed-door sovereignty was broken by cannons. Due to the continuous arrival of foreign investment machines, our country's immature industry was still in its infancy. Since the war, our country's industry has suffered huge damage. Despite the continuous efforts of the Chinese people, the operation of machines and the progress of industry have also improved in terms of quality and quantity, but the future development of our country's industry still requires great efforts.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Land Use</p>
<p>In reviewing how to increase agricultural production, we must first recognize what is the object of agricultural production? It is well known that the object of agricultural production is agricultural land. Now, let's first briefly describe agricultural land. According to Zhang Xinyi's estimate, the total land area is 2,570,000 mu, which is equivalent to 12,000,000,000 mu. Among them, the cultivated land is about 1,240,000,000 mu, accounting for only 10.3% of the total area. However, according to the Land Commission's report, the cultivated land area accounts for 22.34% of the surveyed area, which is more than double the former. Now, let's put it aside and only look at our side. We can also see that the cultivated land area is small. However, the same agricultural land still has the distinction between cultivated land area and crop area. The former is the natural area, and the latter is the production area. To increase agricultural production, we must first increase the crop area. However, there are also limitations on the use of land. As far as arable land is concerned, there are also natural limitations and relative limitations. In other words, natural limitations and human limitations. If we want to increase agriculture, we must eliminate the above restrictions, then the increase in production can be achieved. The so-called natural limitations have the following four factors:</p>
<p>Climate affects the production of crops. For example, the high and low temperature can affect the maturity of crops. Also, the production of rain is directly proportional to the temperature between the frost season. All of these are to affect the production of crops.</p>
<p>The growth of plants not only requires abundant rainfall, but also requires even distribution in time. There are places with very large rainfall, because the distribution of water is different, half a year is sunny and half a year is rainy, which makes it impossible to fully utilize its land, which is enough to be an obstacle to agricultural production.</p>
<p>Terrain refers to the shape of the ground, such as the degree of inclination and its direction, the flatness or unevenness of the land, etc. The flat plains are most beneficial to crops. In today's agricultural mechanization, the value of plains is even more increased. Only if there are other obstacles, even if there is no inclined land, it will also affect production a lot.</p>
<p>Soil. Soil is directly distributed by rocks, which is called accumulation soil. There is also transport soil, which is formed by the accumulation of running water and sediment. The degree of decomposition is better. Only sandy soil with a loose structure and clay soil with a too dense structure are not suitable for cultivation.</p>
<p>As for man-made restrictions, taking China as an example, China's economy is still in a semi-development state. The existence of feudal forces often hinders the use of land and the reclamation of wasteland. For example, the fields of rich merchants in various parts of our country occupy a very wide area and are all excellent lands. Such occupation of thousands of hectares of fertile land hinders land cultivation and affects production. At the same time, our country's small-scale system has been followed to this day, which also indirectly hinders the mechanization of agriculture.</p>
<p>All of these are enough to prevent the full use of land and are sufficient to prevent the increase in production. It is necessary to eliminate the restrictions on land use and even increase the land (cultivability). In this way, production can be increased due to the change in the "fixity" of land supply.</p>
<p>Necessary Conditions for Agricultural Production</p>
<p>Agricultural production is restricted by the limitation of land use, and land use is limited by the limit of food production. Then, the increase in agricultural production must also seek the increase in food production. There are the following aspects to consider for the necessary conditions for increasing agricultural production:</p>
<p>The expansion of cultivated land. In countries with a long history, the expansion of cultivated land may not be able to increase the food production per capita. As a result of population growth, cultivation will be extended to more inferior land, so the output per capita may be reduced instead. However, the development of the New World in modern times has been considerable. These lands can be used as cultivated land, and because they have not been cultivated, they are more fertile than lands that have been cultivated for thousands of years. Therefore, this cultivated land must be expanded as much as possible, and then food production can be increased. In the past 46 years, the world's wheat cultivated land has increased by 69%, with an average annual increase of 1.5%, which is clear evidence.</p>
<p>The progress of biology. Agricultural methods related to crop varieties and pest control are all due to the research of biology. The progress of modern biology has helped the above-mentioned things. Its contribution cannot be denied. The expansion of cultivated land, if there is no seed to adapt to the climate of the increased land, then it cannot have good results. The progress of biology has helped a lot in pest control. Not only have pests been greatly reduced in civilized countries, but also locusts in Egypt have been greatly reduced. The breeding of livestock has also increased in quantity and quality due to the improvement of breeding technology. Therefore, the progress of biology is sufficient to promote the increase of agricultural production.</p>
<p>The development of chemistry. The development of chemistry can greatly improve food production, processing, and consumption. The most helpful to the increase in output is the use of artificial fertilizers. In recent years, the increase in yield per mu in friendly neighbor Japan has been unlimited, which is greatly related to the import of fertilizer. As for the improvement of food processing, it has made previously discarded foods or even become nutritionally essential foods. Therefore, the improvement of chemical technology can increase food production.</p>
<p>The mechanization of agriculture. The adoption of machinery in agriculture is no less than opening a new era in the history of agricultural production. After the Industrial Revolution, the agriculture of various countries has turned to mechanization. Cultivation tools use machines instead of manpower, so the output has greatly increased. Unfortunately, our country's small-scale production technology is still in a feudal atmosphere. Everything follows the old rules. The use of sickles, hoes, and plows is more common in various rural areas. Compared with mechanized production technology, there is a world of difference. It is difficult to increase output by this. However, since we understand the above-mentioned prerequisites for production, we can start from this and strive for improvement. If we can meet the industrial conditions mentioned above, the increase in agricultural production can be expected.</p>
<p>The Situation of Shanghai's Industry After the War</p>
<p>Shanghai is the center of our country's modern industry, so when our country's industry can be represented by Shanghai, the damage suffered by Shanghai's industry after the August 13th War was extremely huge, and its vitality was greatly damaged. According to the survey by the Social Bureau, there were 5,255 registered factories in Shanghai before the incident. After the incident, 4,998 factories were damaged, accounting for more than 95%. Among them, there were 65 textile factories in Shanghai before the war, and only a dozen were left after the incident. There were 44 silk factories in Shanghai before the war, and only a dozen were left after the incident. There were 14 flour factories in Shanghai before the war, and half of them were damaged. The losses of other industrial factories were also huge.</p>
<p>Since the 27th year of the Republic of China, the factories have resumed operation one after another, and new factories have started construction. In the past three years, Shanghai's industry has shown a prosperous appearance. However, since the world war situation expanded after the 30th year, the sources of raw materials and fuel for Shanghai factories have been lacking, and the production of products has been greatly restricted. The industrial sector suddenly felt heavy difficulties, resulting in the decline of the industrial sector in the 31st year. Since this year, although efforts have been made in various aspects to increase industrial production, the difficulties in raw materials and power sales have not been thoroughly resolved, and the results are still very effective. Therefore, revitalizing industry and increasing production are the most basic work in the current economic construction.</p>
<p>Necessary Steps to Increase Industrial Production</p>
<p>Since Shanghai's industry at this stage has the above-mentioned difficulties, it is impossible to increase production without remedying the reasons for the current decline of industry. It is believed that if the current industrial production can be restored to the state before the incident, it can be considered quite satisfactory for the time being. Therefore, the planning for increasing industrial production in this section is aimed at solving the current obstacle problems. As far as I can see, I will briefly describe them as follows:</p>
<p>Unblock the Source of Raw Materials: Raw materials are the lifeblood of production. To increase production, we must ensure the supply of raw materials. At present, various raw materials are subject to the centralized control of wartime materials, which makes the exchange less frequent than before. Stockpiling materials is something that countries must do during wartime, but we should provide convenience for the exchange and sales of raw materials needed for legitimate industrial production and increase the production of raw materials. Then, the increase in industrial production can be expected.</p>
<p>Improve Power Supply: Since the outbreak of the war, the Shanghai Electric Power Company has restricted the supply of electricity due to the difficulty in obtaining coal. Since March of the 30th year, the power consumption has been reduced repeatedly, which has a significant impact on industrial production. However, looking at the Shanghai Industrial Index in 1942, which was about 50% of that in 1936, it can be seen that the industrial sector has suffered a great blow. Although we cannot say that the decline of industry in 1942 was entirely due to the restriction of electricity use, the insufficient supply of electricity is undoubtedly a major reason. If we want to increase industrial production in the future, we must properly plan to unblock the source of coal and rationally supply electricity for factory use.</p>
<p>Set Reasonable Price Limits for Industrial Products: The government's control of prices and the setting of price limits are necessary measures during wartime, which are conducive to stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. However, excessively high price limits will affect people's livelihoods, while excessively low price limits will prevent industrial producers from obtaining legitimate profits, which is also unfair. Therefore, in the process of increasing production, we must carefully consider the setting of price limits and determine them by calculating their costs, supply and demand, and other factors.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points are the most important ones. Other things, such as the supply of industrial capital and the appropriate encouragement of the government, are all necessary work to increase production.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Our country is a weak country, and the impact of the changes it has suffered in the past 100 years cannot be said to be small. People with insight are all striving for the prosperity and strength of the country, but if we want to be strong, we must first be rich, and if we want to be rich, we must first increase production. The current increase in production is especially important for agriculture and industry. Increasing agricultural and industrial production is the most important work in our country's economic construction at present. People should work hard in their respective positions.</p>
<h3>The Way to Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production</h3>
<p>— Bai Ji</p>
<p>Our country is founded on agriculture, a tradition that has remained unchanged for thousands of years. The foundation of our society and economy is still based on agriculture. In recent years, it has been repeatedly affected by wars, and the productivity has gradually declined. Furthermore, industrial construction has lagged behind for a long time, failing to keep pace with advanced countries. Although light and heavy industries have recently developed rapidly, various productions have not yet fully met expectations. Moreover, the rise of military industries during the war has indirectly reduced general production. Therefore, increasing agricultural and industrial production is currently the most urgent task in our country's economic construction and should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Understanding Agricultural Production Increase</p>
<p>Our country is vast and rich in resources, dominating eastern Asia, with a total area of 1.3 million square miles and a population of over 450 million. With fertile fields stretching for thousands of miles, it is a historical agricultural nation. Farmers account for three-quarters of the total population. From this fact, it is clear that the focus of China's economic problems lies in the rural economy. If we want to study how to increase production, we must start with agriculture.</p>
<p>Regarding agricultural production, nothing is more important than food. Food crops account for more than 80% of the total crop acreage in China. In times of peace, international trade is unimpeded. A country only needs to have enough exchange goods to ensure the supply of food. A country's food supply does not necessarily have to focus on domestic production. However, from a national defense perspective, food resources must focus on domestic production. In countries without strong military power to maintain foreign trade, food self-sufficiency is even more important. Moreover, due to the unique economic structure of China's agricultural production, it should be self-sufficient even in peacetime. Otherwise, it will jeopardize the future of the national economy. About 70-80% of the Chinese people depend on agriculture for a living. Their purchasing power comes from agricultural products, and most of their expenses are for food. In a small-scale peasant economy, production is mainly for self-sufficiency. Surpluses are exchanged only after needs are met. Therefore, if food cannot be self-sufficient, there will be no surplus purchasing power. Even if people want to buy insufficient food, it is still impossible, let alone other things. Therefore, the inability to be self-sufficient in food production is a serious problem for China's agricultural production economy.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Increasing Agricultural Production</p>
<p>What are the difficulties in increasing agricultural production in our country?</p>
<p>Lack of large farms. Our country's farms are scattered like stars, with crisscrossing fields and paths. Each farm household's cultivated land is scattered in the east and west, unable to be concentrated in one place. Due to various reasons such as mortgages, sales, and division of property, the cultivated land area becomes smaller and smaller. The drawbacks of this small-scale farming system are as follows:</p>
<p>Waste of land—A lot of land is wasted on paths and field ridges, reducing the production area.</p>
<p>Waste of labor time—Farmers have to run around, wasting labor.</p>
<p>Obstacles to irrigation—Fields far from the water source have to pass through other people's fields for irrigation, leading to frequent disputes and disturbances, especially in drought years.</p>
<p>Inability to use machinery—It feels like a hero has no place to use his talents when trying to apply modern mechanized farm tools on extremely small cultivated land.</p>
<p>Blind selection of varieties—Most farmers blindly follow the experience inherited from their ancestors in selecting and breeding their varieties, without any scientific basis or improvement. It is difficult to increase production this way.</p>
<p>Use of simple farm tools—All farm tools, such as hoes, plows, rakes, waterwheels, winnowing fans, and stone mills, are still in use and are still widely used. Compared with the efficiency of machinery, the difference is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Lack of economic technology for irrigation and drainage—Our country has many natural rivers, so water conservancy projects have always been valued. Larger rivers are the best source of water for irrigation on the one hand, but on the other hand, it is also necessary to prevent floods. Therefore, the development of water conservancy projects has two aspects: the active aspect is irrigation, which increases agricultural production, and the passive aspect is flood prevention, which reduces the possibility of damage to agricultural production. However, until today, there are still various corrupt elements, making the benefits of water conservancy projects hard to see, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>Strategies to Increase Agricultural Production</p>
<p>The following strategies should be implemented to increase agricultural production:</p>
<p>Reclaiming wasteland—Currently, some land in our country is barren due to war, and some has not yet been developed. These barren lands can be utilized for reclamation to achieve the goal of increasing production. However, the use of agricultural land in our country is restricted by the remnants of feudalism and the exploitation of bureaucratic landlords, which hinders the reclamation of wasteland. If farmers want to reclaim a piece of land that they do not own, their income, after compensating for labor costs, must also cover heavy taxes, miscellaneous levies, and rent. Farmers cannot reclaim land unless they can afford all of these expenses. Although our country has a vast territory, most of the wasteland is not suitable for cultivation. The area of wasteland in our country accounts for only 19.1% of the total land area, and only 6.4% of the wasteland is arable. Furthermore, while the total cultivated land in the country can be increased by reclaiming wasteland, it is also barren due to water and drought disasters. Therefore, the actual increase in wasteland is only 1%. Therefore, although wasteland can be reclaimed, it is limited. The increase in our country's agricultural production cannot be solved solely by reclaiming wasteland.</p>
<p>Application of new farm tools and machinery—The application of new farm tools and machinery to cultivation can save labor and promote increased production. According to a report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, one Chinese farmer can cultivate one to four acres, while one American farmer can cultivate more than fifty-seven acres. Chinese farm households can only cultivate an average of two acres of paddy fields, while American farmers can cultivate 200 to 400 acres. In the United States, it takes a total of 289 hours of labor to produce one hectare of cotton, while in China it takes 1,620 hours. From this, it can be seen that although the yield per acre of Chinese land is sometimes higher than that of the United States, the low production efficiency compared to the United States due to the excessive labor required is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Improving crop varieties—Superior seeds should be actively promoted, instead of sticking to old ways and blindly selecting varieties. Scientific knowledge such as soil analysis and variety selection should be actively instilled in the people, so that harvests will naturally increase.</p>
<p>Cultivating agricultural professionals—In order to achieve the purpose of promoting education for the people and instilling scientific knowledge to benefit production, it is necessary to cultivate professional agricultural talents with both learning and experience, so that farmers' cultivation methods will improve day by day, and increased production can be expected.</p>
<p>Opening up large farms—Opening up large farms is a practical strategy to increase production. As mentioned earlier, Chinese farms are small and scattered, with crisscrossing fields and paths that are not concentrated. This hinders large-scale production. Now, if we establish a well-organized large farm with scientific management, all kinds of difficulties can be easily solved. For example, the waste of land can be reduced accordingly. Paths and field ridges can be added to cultivation. Farmers' cultivation can also be concentrated, reducing the labor time spent on movement or transportation, and disputes over irrigation and the inability to use machinery can be eliminated.</p>
<p>Other measures, such as strictly implementing rotational cropping systems, promoting labor services, and developing urban and rural agriculture, are all strategies to promote production and can be implemented at any time according to actual needs.</p>
<p>Understanding Industrial Production Increase</p>
<p>Our country's industrial production is extremely backward. In the past, those who engaged in industry mostly aimed at high profits and low risks. They rarely considered whether their products had practical benefits for the country and the people. Looking at Shanghai, every time a new industry is established, imitators spring up like bamboo shoots after rain, pursuing huge profits without considering its nature, effectiveness, and degree of need. The error of this concept is obvious. During wartime, everything should be aimed at meeting wartime needs. Industrial production bears the important responsibility of completing war missions, so it must change its past goals and strive to produce essential goods. There are many kinds of industrial products. Considering their maximum effectiveness, with very few exceptions, they are all related to national defense and people's livelihood. However, the following items are particularly important:</p>
<p>National defense industry: Includes the production of all war equipment and weapons.</p>
<p>Electrical industry: Includes all electrical equipment, electrical machinery, and tools.</p>
<p>Machinery industry: Includes all motors, engines, and their accessories.</p>
<p>Chemical industry: Includes all medicines, alcohol, acids, and alkalis.</p>
<p>Textile industry: Includes all cotton, silk, wool, and their finished products.</p>
<p>Agricultural product manufacturing industry: Includes all food, vegetable oil, tea, sugar, etc.</p>
<p>Mining and iron smelting industry: Includes the mining and smelting of all metal and non-metal minerals such as gold, silver, steel, antimony, tin, aluminum, as well as coal, oil, gasoline, etc.</p>
<p>Other essential consumer goods industries: Such as leather, paper, cement, matches, rubber, glass, etc.</p>
<p>Currently, increasing industrial production should focus on the above-mentioned major essential industries, with national defense and people's livelihood as the premise, and abandon the selfish idea of profit as the sole purpose. Furthermore, the gradual decline in wartime corporate profits is an inevitable phenomenon.</p>
<p>The reasons for the decrease in profit rates can be summarized into the following six points:　Product prices are restricted.　Wage increases and expenditure increases sharply.　Increased expenses for labor welfare undertakings.　The cost of new construction and expansion is expensive.　The increase in taxes.　The increase in depreciation reserves. From this, it can be seen that during wartime, enterprises are not allowed to pursue profits alone. Therefore, when the time comes, all entrepreneurs must recognize that economic goals should prioritize the overall welfare of the nation and the country. Only then can the increase in production strengthen the nation and enrich the people, and gradually complete economic construction.</p>
<p>Ways to Increase Industrial Production</p>
<p>Increasing industrial production is necessary at this time. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>Raising Industrial Funds. New-style industries require huge investments, and industrial investments usually take a long time to pay off. Ordinary short-term credit institutions (commercial banks)</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>Continued from page 5, they are unable to supply the required funds. Therefore, obtaining and coordinating industrial funds is an important issue in increasing production. The solution to this problem depends on one thing: communication between financial capital and industrial capital. Financial institutions are the central market for gold. Obtaining the large amount of funds needed by industry depends on the investment of financial institutions. However, currently, financial institutions are restricted in many transactions, and the use of funds is also difficult. Relatively long-term industrial investment is a good way to use funds. Therefore, promoting cooperation and communication between financial capital and industrial capital is necessary to increase production. Second, direct loans or assistance from the government. The rise and fall of industry is of great importance to the country, and large-scale enterprises have a particularly profound impact. Therefore, the government should provide as much assistance as possible to general essential industries, or provide loans in various ways to facilitate increased production.</p>
<p>Supplying Sufficient Industrial Raw Materials. The task of industry is to transform raw materials into finished products. There must be raw materials before there can be products. If the supply of raw materials is insufficient, it is impossible to increase production. Currently, due to the interruption of foreign trade, the supply of domestic industrial raw materials is lacking, and it is very difficult to obtain them. To increase industrial production, in addition to increasing the production of raw materials and unblocking their sources, proper distribution is also necessary. The most reasonable method is for industry associations and other institutions to investigate the actual needs of each factory, and then allocate them according to the required proportions, ensuring fairness and quantity, so as to facilitate production and eliminate the black market for raw materials. Moreover, with the advancement of science, there are many examples of countries replacing raw materials with substitutes during wartime due to the lack of raw materials. This should also be promoted, at least to solve part of the raw material problem.</p>
<p>Supplying Sufficient Industrial Power. Industrial production cannot be without appropriate power. In addition to fully utilizing natural hydropower, electricity is the most important source of power. The generation of electricity requires fuels such as coal or gasoline. Currently, during wartime, in order to save fuel, there are restrictions on the supply of electricity. Factories in Shanghai are also subject to electricity restrictions. However, restricting electricity directly affects industrial production, so it should be treated with importance. Electricity consumption that is purely for consumption should be restricted, while the electricity needed by industry should be increased for the sake of increasing wartime production. Not only should it not be reduced, but it should also be increased. At least, its actual needs should be investigated and fully supplied. At the same time, power plants are public utilities in nature and are different from profit-making enterprises. During wartime, the mission they bear is even more important. Therefore, the electricity used by industrial production should be charged at the lowest possible price, so as to reduce production costs and encourage increased production.</p>
<p>Regulating the Transportation and Sales of Products. The transportation and sales of products is an important issue in industrial development. Developing transportation and improving transportation to facilitate the transportation of products is a particularly urgent issue. Looking at the current difficulties in general transportation, if we only increase production, a large amount of products cannot be transported and circulated, and it will not be of much help to people's livelihood. Therefore, unblocking transportation routes and lowering transportation prices are necessary to promote transportation and sales. As for government taxes, under the principle of not hindering tax revenue, they should be reduced as much as possible as an incentive. Moreover, under a controlled economy, commodity prices should be limited by the government. The determination of price limits should be low to benefit people's livelihood, but it should also be in accordance with the circumstances such as regulating its production costs, so that on the other hand, it does not harm the legitimate interests of producers. This is also something that cannot be ignored in increasing production, because otherwise, the driving force for increasing production will be lost, and it will be difficult to increase production.</p>
<p>Improving Industrial Technology. Modern industry is changing rapidly and constantly progressing, and this progress depends on the research and improvement of industrial technology. To increase production, industrial technology must be improved at any time, so that production technology and equipment are suitable for the application of mass production. Therefore, cultivating technical talents, establishing research institutions, and publicizing industrial technology are all important ways to increase production.</p>
<h3>Review of Increasing Agricultural and Industrial Production</h3>
<p>— Li Jiayin</p>
<p>1. How to Increase Agricultural Production</p>
<p>Our country has been founded on agriculture since ancient times, and this has been followed and never changed throughout the dynasties. From the Divine Farmer teaching the people to cultivate and harvest, to the Zhou dynasty establishing the well-field system, until today, it has been more than four thousand years. Eighty percent of the people in the country make a living by farming. The decline of agriculture in our country did not begin today. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, faint signs were already revealed, with the import of foreign rice and wheat increasing daily, and the export of agricultural products such as tea, silk, and miscellaneous items decreasing daily. Since the Republic of China, its decline has been even more rapid and alarming, among which the shortage of food is the most serious. According to the customs trade reports of the last thirty years, rice ranks first and wheat ranks second among the products imported each year. However, the above two are China's main food grains, together accounting for more than 45% of the national purchasing power, and their importance can be imagined.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the decline of agriculture in our country, but I will briefly list the more important ones below, as a reference for those who seek to increase production in the future: (A) Political instability; (B) Natural disasters and disrepair of water conservancy; (C) Failure to fully utilize land resources and unequal land administration; (D) Lack of capital and inflexible rural finance; (E) Inconvenient transportation; (F) Backward production technology (including soil, fertilizer, seeds, pests and diseases, cultivation methods, etc.); (G) Outdated farm tools and insufficient draft cattle.</p>
<p>In addition to staple foods, cotton, and miscellaneous grains, which are in urgent need, the increase in agricultural special products such as tung oil, tea, silk, and agricultural raw materials related to light industry in our country should also not be ignored. The current National Government has recognized the importance of food during wartime and has incorporated wartime economic policies, formulating a food production increase plan. The planning is thorough, but unfortunately, its implementation is rarely seen.</p>
<p>Now, to increase agricultural production, based on my limited understanding, I will divide it into two aspects: short-term and long-term solutions:</p>
<p>A. Short-term Solutions</p>
<p>In terms of governance, since the Republic of China, internal strife and foreign aggression have been incessant, leading to rural bankruptcy and the inability of the people to live in peace. How can they be expected to work happily and increase production? Moreover, due to political instability, other economic, social, and agricultural improvement measures cannot be effective. Therefore, these four must complement each other to be effective. The most important task of governance is to quell unrest and secure the people, eliminate banditry, and have the government and the people work together with one heart and share weal and woe. Those in power must "worry about the world's worries before the world worries, and enjoy the world's joys after the world enjoys," which is a clear principle and needs no further elaboration.</p>
<p>In terms of economy, farmers must be able to obtain a reasonable return, reducing the danger of "tilling without clothing or food." According to the preliminary cost estimate report of agricultural crops in Pudong District, Shanghai, by the Chinese Economic Research Association in July of the thirty-second year of the Republic of China: "A total of thirty-four locations were surveyed. In terms of the types of agricultural products, only five types, namely cotton, wheat, rice, beans, and rapeseed, were considered... In terms of income, the most profitable crop is soybeans, because no fertilizer is needed for planting beans, the cost is relatively low, and the selling price is not as subject to control as cotton and rice. Therefore, the profit per mu is as high as more than 500 yuan, and the interest rate is the highest among the above agricultural products. However, planting cotton not only does not yield any profit, but also falls far short of the cost. According to the calculation of labor, wages, and raw material market prices in April of the thirty-second year of the Republic of China, planting one mu of cotton will result in a loss of about 460 yuan. Planting one mu of rice yields a profit of 218 yuan; wheat yields a profit of 207 yuan; and rapeseed yields a profit of 190 yuan." The price of cotton raw materials is subject to controlled prices, so farmers cannot make a profit and even suffer heavy losses. This has a serious impact on cotton production, which is declining day by day; the cotton textile industry will inevitably reduce production or even shut down. In addition to the above-mentioned economic measures, there are more advanced ones: Negative measures: (A) Reducing rent and taxes; (B) Reducing agricultural product transportation costs and facilitating operations; (C) Promoting agricultural loans and strictly prohibiting usury. Positive measures: (A) Establishing loan financial institutions to provide farmers with low-interest loans to purchase seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, and daily necessities, etc.; (B) Establishing production and sales cooperative organizations to prevent unscrupulous merchants from manipulating prices and making profits; (C) Stipulating reasonable prices for agricultural products (estimating costs and profits), which must comply with the goals of the controlled economy policy and increased production.</p>
<p>In terms of society, we should economize on consumption and promote the use of substitutes for rice and wheat. Therefore, in addition to rice and wheat, the government should advocate eating potatoes and coarse grains. We should popularize agricultural education and instill scientific knowledge, and cultivate agricultural improvement technicians to guide the people in applying fertilizers, selecting seeds, and cultivating suitable crops according to the weather and local conditions, using new farm tools, and implementing methods to increase production. We should also instill in farmers the scientific knowledge that "man can conquer nature" and not "leave everything to fate." We should strictly punish unscrupulous merchants who hoard goods and manipulate prices, both in their minds and in reality.</p>
<p>B. Long-term Solutions</p>
<p>Reclaiming Wasteland: There has never been accurate statistics on the cultivated land area in our country. According to the estimate of American Baker, China has about 700 million acres of arable land, that is, the arable land in our country can reach 29% of the total area, and the cultivated land accounts for about 26% of the arable land, that is, 180 million acres. If Baker's statistics are reliable, then our country should have more than 460 million mu of arable land. There are still 340 million mu of arable land that can be cultivated but has not been cultivated. If the government can fully assist the people in revitalizing reclamation, the arable land in our country can be greatly increased, and the agricultural output will also increase accordingly.</p>
<p>Repairing Water Conservancy: Water conservancy and cultivation are closely related and cannot be neglected. The floods of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River are well known to the people of the country, and the droughts in the northwest are also well known to the people. The evils involved have a great impact on agriculture and people's livelihood. In this case, if we do not seek to increase agricultural production, then how can we ignore the importance of repairing water conservancy? Moreover, water conservancy projects are huge undertakings and are a major plan for the country and the nation for thousands of years, which cannot be undertaken by the people alone.</p>
<p>Selecting Seeds: Agricultural experts from all over the world, under the guidance of the government and academic institutions, are devoting their lives to improving agriculture, enriching food, improving varieties, and increasing production. Therefore, they sow the seed before the seedling appears, and plant the seedling before it flowers, so that it will bear fruit. This is the result of applying scientific methods, which we should not ignore or imitate.</p>
<p>Improving Soil and Fertilizer: The analysis and improvement of soil is indeed an urgent task. During the Warring States period, Prime Minister Yan Ying of Qi, when he was sent to Chu, said to the King of Chu: "Oranges grow south of the Huai River, while trifoliate oranges grow north of the Huai River." The species is the same, but the fruit differs due to the different locations. Why? If we analyze it from a scientific standpoint, it is because the soil quality and climate south and north of the Huai River are different. This work must be carried out by government experimental institutions that establish technical research institutes, provide assistance and guidance. In recent years, the demand for chemical fertilizers for agricultural cultivation in our country has increased day by day. Due to the lack of fertilizer and high prices, farmers are unable to purchase it, and the government agencies urgently need to lend or allocate it to farmers at low prices to facilitate increased production.</p>
<p>Improving Farm Tools: The farm tools in our country are simple and crude, and there has been little improvement. If new-style farming machinery can be adopted, its efficiency will definitely increase. As for the application of engine-powered agricultural machinery (such as in agricultural countries in the United States), it may not be allowed by the facts. However, if the government, agricultural cooperatives, or promotion associations can rent out simple modern equipment such as pumps, tillage equipment, and threshing machines, and send personnel to provide guidance, the effect on increasing production will be considerable.</p>
<p>Preventing and Controlling Pests: Insect pests, especially locust plagues, are the most serious. According to entomologists, the national loss is estimated to be 120,000 million yuan every year. The fundamental solutions are: strengthening prevention; clearing weeds; consolidating dried-up marshes and barren mountains; and universally implementing winter plowing.</p>
<p>Improving Cultivation Methods: Our country has a vast territory, and the climate and geology vary from place to place. We need to conduct on-site research and apply different cultivation methods: (A) Applying a transplanting system; (B) Improving dryland farming methods; (C) Researching intercropping in paddy fields; (D) Verifying which crops are suitable for planting (such as cotton, forests, miscellaneous crops, vegetables, etc.) and applying appropriate fertilizers; (E) Studying the rotation of crops and the timing. The depth of irrigation and other issues.</p>
<p>2. How to Increase Industrial Production</p>
<p>Modern industry in our country began in 1862 when Zeng Guofan founded the Anqing Arsenal, and Li Hongzhang founded the Manufacturing Bureau in Shanghai and Suzhou. It has been around for seventy to eighty years. In terms of its nature: it has shifted from military industry to civilian industry. In terms of the organization of its operation: it has shifted from government-run to government-private joint venture to government-supervised private operation to private operation. In terms of the process of development: the initial stage was the creation period, the early Republic of China was the prosperous period (the golden age of light industry), the period after the eleventh year of the Republic of China was the period of decline, and the period after the twenty-first year of the Republic of China was the period of revival. After the outbreak of the war in the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, it was a period of destruction. State-owned and private light industry has been severely damaged, which cannot be quantified by numbers. In terms of its characteristics: two-thirds of China's industry is handicraft production, and one-third is modern light industry. In other words, the modernization of China's industry has not yet been completed. In China's modern industry, most of the major industrial sectors are controlled by foreigners, while Chinese national capital industries are mostly in a subordinate position. For example, in the production of machinery, only 23.5% is manufactured by Chinese, and 76.5% is dependent on foreign supply. Most of China's modern industries are located in coastal or riverside cities, especially in the concessions, so they are easily constrained by foreign political and economic forces. Transportation and financial institutions are mostly operated by foreign capital, which makes domestic resources subject to foreign control and prevents the development of our own light and heavy industries. Chinese national capital is in great need of capital and high-interest loans. In terms of types, the most important industries in the country are: textile industry, food industry, chemical industry, paper industry, power industry, leather industry, oil industry, rubber industry, match industry, tobacco industry, pharmaceutical industry, and cultural industry. All of the above industries are private industries.</p>
<p>The author believes that for the current increase in industrial production, the prior questions are: How to formulate an economic construction plan? How to rebuild modern industry? What were the reasons for the failure and inability to increase production of modern industry in the past? What are the immediate causes of the current inability to increase production of modern industry?</p>
<p>Based on my humble opinion and referring to the opinions of various countries, I will briefly answer as follows:</p>
<p>1. Economic construction is a planned economy for the revival of a nation-state. The economic construction plan of the Soviet Union is the most obvious example in modern history. Although our country also had a four-year or five-year economic construction plan in the past, it was unfortunately not implemented. "It depends on people," which is the most important thing. Therefore, political construction and reform are still the most urgent tasks. The government must gain the trust of the people in order to effectively implement its plans. "A government without credibility cannot stand," which is a famous saying both at home and abroad. The political and economic structure of "politics belonging to officials and economy belonging to the people" can no longer exist in a modern country. In short, economic construction must be carefully planned by the government and have a thorough strategy. If the government and the people work together with one heart and go all out, it will surely be successful.</p>
<p>2. According to the current human, material, and financial resources of our country and the development process of modern industry, we should promote the development of light industry, especially the processing and manufacturing of local agricultural products, so that agriculture and industry can coordinate and increase production, and be generally rationalized.</p>
<p>3. The reasons for the failure and inability to increase production of industry in our country in the past are quite complex. I will briefly list the more important ones below: oppression by foreign economic aggression; political instability; unsound finance; capital shortage; lack of raw materials; backward technology; poor factory management; the government has no practical measures to encourage and support industry; inconvenient transportation; exorbitant taxes; and the financial community and the industrial community cannot achieve cooperation.</p>
<p>4. The immediate causes of the current inability to increase production or even stagnation of industry are: lack of raw materials; high cost of manufactured goods, while their prices (after price limits) are low, with no profit to be made, and there is a risk of loss, which will inevitably lead to stagnation; insufficient power, limited electricity and fuel, and production cannot be expanded; difficulty in selling manufactured goods, and weakening local purchasing power; government agencies and entrepreneurs cannot cooperate and assist; the number of technicians is decreasing day by day because factories are either shrinking or shutting down, and wages cannot keep up with the rising cost of living, which will inevitably lead to a change of profession; and insufficient food rations and rising wages for workers. The above seven points are indeed the most painful problems for manufacturers, and have a very important impact on industrial production. It is hoped that the authorities will try to find ways to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>For the sake of future industrial production, the author puts forward the following urgent suggestions for remedial measures. I hope readers will give their opinions on whether they are appropriate.</p>
<p>1. The government and financial institutions should find ways to encourage or support industries. For private light industries that are closely related to military and civilian needs, the government and financial institutions should provide financial assistance and supervise their use of domestic agricultural products in coordination with increased production. For example: cotton textile industry, chemical fertilizer industry, agricultural product processing industry, daily chemical industry, paper industry, etc. The methods of encouraging or assisting increased production are:</p>
<p>Financial assistance: For starting an industry, the most important thing is sufficient capital. The methods of government and financial institutions to subsidize capital are: (A) Loans: The government or financial institutions provide or lend low-interest funds, and stipulate that the loan be repaid within a certain period of time or after making a profit. (B) Guaranteeing interest or providing subsidies: The government designates certain military or civilian industries and gives interest on their capital so that those engaged in the industry do not have to worry about capital and interest expenses. In addition, the government can adopt a subsidy method to make up for the losses.</p>
<p>Supply of raw materials: Raw materials are the main supplies for industrial manufacturing, and most of them rely on imports from other places. If the government collects and allocates them, the prices of raw materials can be unified, transportation costs can be reduced, and all kinds of transportation troubles can be avoided, so the cost of raw materials will be lower. As a result, the products also have a fixed price, so manufacturers can also manufacture with peace of mind and obtain legitimate profits.</p>
<p>Technical guidance: The government should send personnel to supervise the actual situation of increased production in various factories at any time and provide guidance on the points that should be improved in technology. Secondly, the government should organize technical research institutions to invite foreign technical experts to China for research and guidance, and train technical personnel to assist various factories.</p>
<p>Supply of power: All modern industrial sectors need considerable power, such as electricity and fuel. The government or power supply agencies should provide sufficient power and fuel to various factories at low prices in order to reduce the cost of manufactured goods.</p>
<p>Transportation and Sales of Manufactured Goods: Simply having a large increase in production without being able to transport and sell it will inevitably lead to a drop in prices or create a crisis of hoarding by unscrupulous merchants. It should be purchased by the control agencies at a reasonable price. If the purchase price is lower than the cost, the result of the controlled economy will be the shutdown of industry.</p>
<p>2. Improving Management: The failure and low efficiency of modern industry in our country in the past were due to poor management methods. Domestic entrepreneurs only pay attention to the two departments of sales and manufacturing, and ignore the importance of management. Now, from the internal organization of various industrial sectors, scientific management methods must be implemented to improve administrative and productive efficiency. Such as the allocation of workers' working hours, the improvement of raw material procurement and operating methods, the consideration of manufacturing procedures and equipment, the layout of factory safety and health facilities, the planning and use of capital funds, the improvement of product quality and quantity, and the budget and audit of product costs are all within the scope of management.</p>
<p>3. Technical Improvement and Rationalization: Each factory should formulate a concrete plan and rationally coordinate the allocation of its manufacturing resources, power, and manufacturing methods to increase production. Technical improvement is a gradual process, and technical personnel must be used. Secondly, the distribution of labor, the adoption of a rotational operation system, and the coordinated production of various industrial sectors - the division of labor and cooperation system, etc. - are all closely related to increasing production.</p>
<p>3. Conclusion</p>
<p>According to the current situation of agriculture and industry in our country, it is necessary to revive and increase production. The solution to these two problems requires both short-term and long-term solutions. Therefore, the political construction and economic construction are very important and must complement each other to be successful.</p>
<p>Although agriculture and industry are different, they each have their own independence; however, in essence, they are mutually causal, that is, they each have their own interdependence, and neither can be overemphasized. Therefore, the increase in agricultural and industrial production urgently needs to be coordinated and coordinated with each other under a complete economic construction plan to achieve the rationalization and modernization of production.</p>
<p>At present, the most important thing for increasing agricultural production in our country is food. The most important thing for increasing industrial production is light industry for civilian needs. The common difficulties in increasing production in both are: the government, financial institutions, and producers cannot cooperate with each other; the national economy is in crisis; there is a lack of scientific knowledge, technology, and guidance institutions; the controlled economic structure is not perfect; the coordination of agricultural and industrial production has not reached rationalization and universalization; and transportation is difficult.</p>
<p>If the above problems can be remedied as soon as possible, and the government and the people work together with one heart and concentrate human, material, and financial resources and go all out, then the great cause of economic construction will be promising!</p>
<h3>My Views on Increasing Agricultural and Industrial Production</h3>
<p>— Tianji</p>
<p>Today, if we want to suppress and stabilize prices, eliminate hoarding, stabilize people's livelihoods domestically, and assist in the construction of Greater East Asia externally, it all comes down to increasing agricultural and industrial production. Based on my observations, the following areas offer potential for increased production:</p>
<p>Regarding Agriculture</p>
<p>1. Implementing Winter Cultivation: Currently, rice prices are high. Many people in Lou County try planting wheat after the autumn harvest and set aside small vegetable plots to use as seedling beds the following year. After the wheat is harvested, they use it. In the eastern Zhejiang area, winter wheat planting is practiced, and the result is that rice yields are not reduced, and a wheat harvest is also obtained. According to scientific research, crop rotation can indeed replenish soil fertility, thus increasing harvests.</p>
<p>2. Utilizing Wasteland: Our country has a vast amount of wasteland, estimated at over 140 million acres. Since the Incident (likely referring to the outbreak of war), many damaged roads could now be utilized. Good farmland everywhere is overgrown with weeds. Local governments should order people to cultivate it, ensuring that no land is left uncultivated.</p>
<p>3. Procurement Issues: Government rice purchases are often unreasonable. Tenant farmers often sell their rice at low prices and then have to buy what they need from the market at high prices. Furthermore, large landowners often hoard their grain in warehouses, waiting for favorable prices. In the future, it is hoped that those in charge of procurement will first make a minimum provision for tenant farmers—at least enough food for a tenant farmer's family for a year. The laws must be strictly enforced against large landowners without showing favoritism. The purchase price must also consider costs, the standard of living of farmers, and profits.</p>
<p>4. Farm Tools and Fertilizers: China largely has a small-farm system, with land divided and cultivated. Machinery is not well-suited to this system, and rural areas are bankrupt and unable to purchase it. Therefore, very few farmers use machinery. Currently, a single ox costs as much as ten thousand gold coins, which small farmers cannot afford. They are forced to use old or weak animals or supplement their labor with human power. When tools are not efficient, how can work be done well? The urgent task is for the government to fully protect working cattle and find ways to increase their reproduction. Currently, imported fertilizers are cut off. It is essential to manufacture insecticides and chemical fertilizers and then sell them to farmers at or below cost. Water conservancy and irrigation should also be emphasized; otherwise, empty talk of increasing production will be of little use if farmers' hearts are willing but their strength is insufficient.</p>
<p>Regarding Industry</p>
<p>1. Currently, there are three major contradictory phenomena in Chinese industry:</p>
<p>Many factories primarily focus on profiting from stock shortages and price increases, considering product sales as a long-term prospect, even limiting production to wait for favorable prices. So-called capital increases are often used to improve the market value of the company's own stock, benefiting development. This is the first contradiction.</p>
<p>Recently, the government's purchase of cotton cloth has severely impacted hoarders. However, even though the purchase has been underway for a month, the distribution has been delayed. Furthermore, in Shanghai alone, many small-scale hand-weaving industries, which usually rely on black market cotton yarn for production, cannot buy it anywhere and have been forced to shut down, creating a serious social problem. This is the second contradiction.</p>
<p>The government promotes conservation, and electricity restrictions are very strict. Since the implementation of these restrictions, improper entertainment venues continue to operate late into the night, while industries that rely on electricity suffer greatly and cannot fully utilize machinery. Under these electricity restrictions, seeking an increase in industrial production is akin to climbing a tree to catch fish. This is the third contradiction.</p>
<p>The above three points are obvious. The government should quickly provide guidance, relief, and adjustments so that industry can get back on the right track. This would be fortunate for the country.</p>
<p>2. Reviving Handicraft Industries: While modern industry in our country has developed, rural handicraft industries still hold a dominant position. Their collapse is a recent phenomenon. Since the Incident, two-thirds of China's industry has been destroyed or relocated. In this situation, it is necessary to encourage the revival of traditional handicraft industries. There are three advantages to utilizing handicraft industries at present: (1) The development of heavy industry requires machinery, but the source of machinery has been cut off, and development cannot be completed overnight. Traditional industrial machinery is easy to manufacture, and the Chinese people can manufacture it themselves. (2) Traditional industries have not completely collapsed. They still have a presence in rural areas, making revival easy. (3) Handicraft products are simple and durable, which is very suitable for promoting thrift. Therefore, it is necessary to promote them now.</p>
<p>3. Focus on the Production of Essential Goods: Many Chinese entrepreneurs tend to concentrate on businesses with high profits and no risks, resulting in uneven production. In the future, the production of all industries related to the national economy and people's livelihoods should be increased. Conversely, non-essential goods, such as liquor production, foil manufacturing, cosmetics, and luxury goods, should be drastically reduced under the wartime economic system to save manpower and resources and use them for legitimate purposes.</p>
<p>4. Labor Issues: Labor is one of the elements of production. However, its impact on production varies depending on the workers' interest, ability, and spirit. Currently, most workers are listless, which significantly affects production. Even with joint efforts, factories still suffer losses.</p>
<p>Turn to Page Seven</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Continued from Page Six</p>
<p>5. Technology: Our industrial technology is very backward. For example, in the textile industry, before the Incident, Japanese-funded yarn factories used only 240 workers per 10,000 spindles to spin 20-count yarn, while Chinese-funded yarn factories required 350-750 workers. Recently, Japanese industry has made rapid progress, while Chinese industry has regressed with little improvement. This point requires the practical guidance of technical experts from friendly nations.</p>
<p>6. Sufficient Supply of Raw Materials: Currently, imported raw materials have long been unavailable. The authorities should try their best to smooth the flow of domestic raw materials. The method of control should also prioritize the convenience of manufacturers in obtaining raw materials so that the industrial sector can still use its existing equipment to supply various necessities.</p>
<p>7. Application of the Continuous Work Week System: If fuel and raw material problems can be solved, the continuous work week system can be implemented to increase production. This method originated in Soviet Russia. Its characteristic is that workers' lives can be adequately adjusted, and factories can still produce continuously. Work is done on a five-day week basis. Within the five days of the week, workers work four days and rest one day. The government should formulate individual work week systems based on the conditions of various industries, allowing workers to take shifts and have different days off. China's industry can consider trying this method.</p>
<p>8. Eliminating Elaborate Decorations: Adding decorations to a finished product can certainly increase its value, but this type of work is clearly unsuitable in the current situation. Furthermore, decorated items are not as strong and durable as those that are not.</p>
<p>9. Incentivizing: The Japanese government recently implemented a price incentive system to promote production and increase output. The system is divided into two types: special and general. The former applies when increasing the production of specific essential materials, while the latter applies when forming individual prices based on unified cost accounting. The former is further divided into two types. One is that when the output of factories, mines, etc., exceeds the standard output, for example, when the increased output reaches 20 percent, the government will purchase the increased portion at a high price, and the price will be calculated incrementally. The other is implemented when the production time is reduced. For example, in the shipbuilding industry, the construction period for a ship is strictly set at three months. If the construction period is reduced to two months or two and a half months, and the production time is shortened, the government will also purchase the ship at a high price. This is a major measure to incentivize production. The latter is also divided into two types. One is that if a specific factory or business reduces its production costs compared to the previous period and the efficiency rate improves, an incentive system is used. The other is that if a factory's production costs are lower than the standard costs of other factories in the same industry, incentives are given based on the lower cost components. In addition, there are special incentives for various inventions, such as the invention of substitutes, the improvement of armaments, etc. As the saying goes, "Stones from other mountains can be used to polish jade." The above can also serve as a reference for us.</p>
<p>10. Sufficient Assistance from the Financial Sector: In peacetime, the development of a country's industry originally relies on the support of the financial sector, and this is especially true in wartime. During wartime, under unstable conditions, factory deposits are often withdrawn entirely, and external loans cannot be recovered, leading to financial difficulties. The financial sector should urgently provide loans to support the factories and fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<p>In conclusion, China's agriculture and industry are still immature, and their future depends on the guidance and support of the government. It is hoped that the wise authorities can stabilize people's livelihoods domestically, suppress and stabilize prices, achieve independence and self-reliance externally, relieve the people from distress, and secure the nation's foundation. This is what I sincerely hope for.</p>
<h3>How to Improve the Health of the People</h3>
<p>— Shen Siliang</p>
<p>On the Double Tenth Festival of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the editor of Shen Bao invited submissions on the topic of "How to Improve the Health of the People." Although I have dabbled in the sports world for years, I am limited in knowledge and experience. I will address the topic based on physical education and present my views in two points for reference.</p>
<p>The Impact of Physical Education</p>
<p>In the past, the habits of our people were often characterized by a preference for stillness and an aversion to labor. Therefore, they did not attach importance to physical education. Later, seeing that various countries around the world were becoming increasingly strong and the development of physical education was becoming more intense, while the strength of the people was becoming more prominent, they realized the importance of physical education. Thus, they made great efforts to promote it and quickly catch up. Although we are still far behind in comparison to the progress of other countries, it can be said that everyone is aware of it. Originally, the basic principle of physical education is to strengthen the body. Its impact on the body is not only to increase weight and promote muscle growth but also to develop various organs and enrich people's thoughts and spirit. For example, a person who sits at a desk all day long and does not engage in any physical activity will eventually develop a hunched back. At this time, if there is no gymnastic exercise to remedy this, the back will be weak, oxygen cannot penetrate deeply, and the tiny blood vessels at the tip of the lungs will not circulate easily, creating factors for future lung disease. Or the stomach and intestines may be subjected to compression, causing indigestion symptoms. If mental weakness and slow thinking occur, these ailments will also develop simultaneously. These occurrences, often found in our population, are truly dangerous. Therefore, during our childhood, the muscles attached to the spine should always maintain a straight posture. If such undesirable phenomenon is discovered, it should immediately be remedied with gymnastic exercise to recover. Therefore, people who advocate physical education possess endurance and persistence in their work, because after long-term exercise, they can accelerate the circulation of blood throughout the body and make the muscles contract firmly. According to reports from physiologists, athletes do not have more blood cells and platelets in their bodies than ordinary people, but the blood in athletes' bodies can accelerate and continuously transport air to the muscles. Therefore, the endurance of the muscles is almost unlimited. When people are engaged in strenuous work, they are consuming the stickiness in the muscles. When the stickiness decreases, the action of the muscles becomes sluggish, and fatigue is felt. But when athletes exercise, their muscles are constantly consuming and replenishing, circulating endlessly and have become accustomed to it. Therefore, people who exercise often feel happy at work, which is what health provides. In summary, the impact of physical education is to develop the body, and its purpose is to: 1. Strengthen various organs, 2. Strengthen muscles, 3. Improve agility.</p>
<p>Stages of Strengthening the Body</p>
<p>There are stages to strengthening the body. The appropriate exercise for youth may not be suitable for children, and the appropriate exercise for adults may not be suitable for youth. Each has the correct use for adapting to the body and cannot be forced to be the same. For example, children from six to ten years old are in the early development stage. During this period, physical education should be the goal of teaching, that is, to cultivate a lively and healthy body and mind, and to develop the inherent playfulness of children. Therefore, teaching materials should focus on games and natural activities, allowing them to develop freely, and the teaching curriculum should be a secondary subject. From the age of ten to fourteen, formal physical education courses should be given, and two hours of extracurricular exercise should be forced every day. Their physical education goal is to train the activities and skills necessary for human life, such as jumping, throwing, climbing, hanging, and running. Because at this time, their physical development is stronger than at any other time. In addition, it is best to practice swimming to help their muscles develop. A youth aged fourteen to eighteen is gradually turning towards struggle and competition, so attention should be paid to cultivating their martial spirit. The exercise goal should focus on gymnastics, track and field, ball games, competitions, and martial arts. In addition to formal physical education classes, school authorities should provide about three hours of extracurricular activities. During adolescence, outdoor activities, camping, and rural travel should also be promoted to regulate their lives. Because this period can also be said to be a dangerous period for youth, if there is no proper entertainment, they may easily go astray, which should be noted. After the age of eighteen, they should engage in military training or labor service to strengthen their muscles and bones. Before the war, Germany specially established youth camps, implemented military labor services, and forced young people to participate. There was a special department responsible for management. In addition to labor service, there were also regular exercises, normal entertainment, and gathering countless young people in one camp to cultivate national consciousness. The opportunity to exercise young people was used to carry out various construction projects, such as water conservancy projects, reclaiming wasteland, building roads, and improving agricultural products. These are the benefits of the country exercising young people, killing two birds with one stone. We can emulate this. In addition, social physical education facilities should be set up to encourage the public to learn from each other, such as public gymnasiums, swimming pools, and fitness rooms, which should be established in every city so that everyone can have the opportunity and environment to exercise. It must be known that strengthening the body is not something that can be accomplished overnight, and only by continuous effort can true health be obtained. From now on, I hope that our people will make physical education their only important task, engage in exercise, avoid sporadic and inconsistent efforts, and have the determination to persevere, so that the future of national health will be promising.</p>
<h3>The National Health Problem</h3>
<p>— Qiu Wenke</p>
<p>Today is the 32nd National Day of the Republic of China. On this happy day, it is extremely meaningful to discuss how to improve the health of the people.</p>
<p>National Health and Sound Politics</p>
<p>Now, it is undeniable that China is filled with decadence. The people and the government are separated by a wide gap, and each is seeking their own survival. In China in its 32nd year, I ask, "Participation in the war" and "construction" cannot begin. A wise government, in order to revive the motherland, must first become one with the people, and only then can it have an effect. Therefore, before discussing the issue of improving national health, we sincerely petition the government to establish a public opinion organ so that the people can exert their full strength and make political adjustments as soon as possible. Why do we mention "improving politics" again in the discussion of improving national health? Because national health and sound politics are closely related. For example, if the people of a country are all healthy, but the politics above are very corrupt, and the people and the government do not communicate with each other, and the people do not help the government, the government is not trying their best to benefit them, how can this country survive? Therefore, while we are discussing the "national health" problem out of self-love, we also very much hope that the government will deeply reflect on itself.</p>
<p>Examining the Reasons for National Weakness</p>
<p>There is no need to mention the past, but observing the present, eight out of ten people in the country have become ill. The most common diseases are stomach disease and lung disease. Why are there so many people suffering from these two diseases? Because there are those who eat too much and those who do not eat enough. It is just like what Mr. Yoshida Tosuke said in his Shen Bao Weekly Review on September 19, "On Chinese Meals": "...In this family where there are few middle class people, there is a class that specializes in eating Chinese meals (referring to four cold dishes, four hot dishes, ten main courses, dim sum, and one soup - note by the author). At the same time, there is a beggar class that survives by eating their leftovers. There are particularly more of these people than in any other country...While the Chinese boast that Chinese meals are the best in the world in terms of quantity and variety, the number of beggars who survive by eating leftovers cannot be considered the best in the world..." Therefore, the stomachs of the upper class are overstuffed, and the stomachs of the beggar class are too lacking in nourishment. Both have lost their normal function and become stomach diseases. The people who suffer from lung diseases have the same reasons as those who suffer from stomach diseases. Middle-class people are engrossed in smoking and drinking all night long, their lives are irregular, and their mental and physical strength is exhausted, and they become ill over time. The people of the beggar class not only suffer from severe malnutrition but also gather and live in small alleys and slums, their characters are degraded, the air is dirty, and they suffer from various forms of oppression, which leads to mental fatigue and lack of strength. These are the biggest causes of tuberculosis. In short, national weakness is caused by too unequal a phenomenon.</p>
<p>Promptly Implementing a "Self-Love" Movement</p>
<p>The two most common causes of illness mentioned above can only be quickly cured by the power of the government. For example, banning smoking and gambling, forcing frugality, encouraging sports, rewarding production, increasing household food and rations of daily necessities are all good medicines for the disease. Unfortunately, the government is not actively doing these things and lets the disease spread freely. Because we recognize that the national health problem is urgent and must be resolved quickly, we can only passively advocate the "self-love" movement and persuade the people to abstain from smoking and gambling and focus on nourishing their bodies. If this movement can be promoted, at least it can maintain some of the country's vitality.</p>
<p>How to Improve the Health of Young People</p>
<p>I am young and have limited experience, so I can only discuss the topic from a small perspective and focus on modern young people, regardless of their wealth, as the subject of discussion. Young friends, before discussing the topic, we should grasp the two words "self-love" tightly as the basis for discussing the topic. Because if we do not do this, this topic cannot be discussed. Now that we are talking about how to improve our health for the sake of self-love, we should immediately reflect on ourselves whether we are standing on the path of depravity or stepping on the path of advancement. If we belong to the former, we should suddenly turn around, repent sincerely, and implement our "self-love" movement; if we belong to the latter, we should work harder, be brave and diligent, and always stand in the position of the vanguard of the "self-love" movement.</p>
<p>The Specific Method of Implementing the Self-Love Movement Here we have one kind of negative health preservation and one kind of active fitness.</p>
<p>Negative Health Preservation</p>
<p>Because we are all standing under the creed of "self-love," the rules of health preservation are very strict: 1. Do not smoke (smoking is harmful to the heart, trachea, and brain nerves). 2. Do not drink alcohol (alcohol is harmful to the central nervous system, eyesight, stomach, and heart. However, some people say that drinking a little alcohol can harmonize the blood and keep warm, but young people are often sharp and competitive and drink boldly as a glorious thing, which ultimately harms their bodies, so young people should not drink alcohol). 3. Do not dance (music can cultivate temperament, but there are many people flowing in and out of the dance hall, and the good and bad are mixed. Pure young people are lured by material enjoyment or impulsed by sexual desire and lose their minds, so dancing is harmful to thrift and body and mind). 4. Do not gamble (those who like to gamble cannot talk about self-love at all because gambling makes people stimulate their nerves to the extreme day and night, and eventually their spirits are injured and their ambitions are abandoned, so gamblers are irrational animals). 5. Eat only until you are not hungry for three meals a day. Even with this one scoop of rice and one drink, we should be content and happy to receive it to avoid material distress and sadness. Drink at least four large glasses of water every day, especially before going to bed, you must drink a glass of boiled water to ensure that the bowels are open the next morning. Eight hours of sleep is the most standard. When sleeping, all thoughts are abandoned and no reverie is allowed to avoid insomnia. Walk for half an hour in the setting sun to exercise your muscles and bones and feel refreshed. If you can follow the above five rules without fail, not only will you not get sick all year round, but you can also extend your life for many years.</p>
<p>Active Fitness</p>
<p>If you want to train your body into a bronze muscle iron bone, you must first practice the above five rules; otherwise, if you do not maintain your health properly, you will have wasted your efforts in exercising. Secondly, exercising the body depends on perseverance, diligence, and unremitting efforts to succeed. There are many kinds of fitness methods, among which the easiest to achieve quickly and the most interesting are physical exercises. However, in Shanghai, only the YMCA Fitness Room, the Times Gymnasium, the Shanghai Fitness Academy, and the Jingwu Athletic Association have perfect equipment for this exercise. The number is too small, and the venues are small, so this exercise has not been popularized to this day. However, we can buy one or two pairs of 5-pound and 10-pound dumbbells and use them for stretching exercises at one o'clock every morning. This has unexpected magical effects on enhancing arm strength and developing the chest. In this way, after training for a year or so, we can partner with four or five "bodybuilding" comrades, organize a small fitness club, add equipment, and encourage each other. In this way, physical exercises can become popular.</p>
<p>The Health of Young People and the Vitality of the Country</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Young people are full of vitality." This vitality is the concrete manifestation of young people's "activity." A strong youth must be matched with a strong will to express that lively energy. However, a strong will should be based on a correct outlook on life and society to be used to its fullest extent. A correct outlook on life and society is to find justice in humanity. The Founding Father (Sun Yat-sen) was able to revolutionize for forty years without being discouraged because he based his strong will on a correct outlook on life. Therefore, we young people, in addition to fighting in the contradictory life to maintain and enhance our vitality, should actively use our vitality in this turbulent era to fight for freedom, equality, and fraternity to the end. Only then can our China eliminate decadence and establish vitality.</p>
<p>Improving National Health</p>
<h3>Overview of the Origins and Development of Chinese Painting</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Haisu studies Western painting, and is particularly skilled in Chinese painting, his painting skills are superb, and his reputation is world-renowned. In the past, he collected masterpieces of Chinese painting from various dynasties, photographed them, and made printing plates, which were compiled into a giant volume according to the chronological order of his family's birth, which was quite impressive, but unfortunately it was hindered for some reason and was not immediately published. Recently, this newspaper has bound it into a book, named "A Mirror of Famous Paintings of Pu Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties", and it is scheduled to be published today on National Day. At the beginning of this book, Mr. Liu wrote an article summarizing the origins and development of Chinese painting, totaling eight thousand words, covering the history of Chinese painting from beginning to end, without leaving anything out. It is not only suitable for those who aspire to painting, but also for those who care about national essence. Therefore, we will publish the entire article, just to add a touch of color to this National Day celebration.</p>
<p>Our country's painting began with hieroglyphs, where writing and painting were not separated. Through the Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, painting was established as separate from the "Four Arts" [琴棋書畫 - music, chess, calligraphy, and painting]. Zhang Heng and Cai Yong of the Han dynasty were both famous for their paintings, and although we have not seen their broad works, their names are already evident in historical records. By the time of the Wei, Jin, and Six Dynasties, Buddhism was introduced into China, and Chinese culture ushered in a new era. At that time, Buddhist paintings flowed into China, and we were quite able to absorb their strengths, and the so-called new art was produced. Famous artists emerged at this time, with elegant styles and divine inspiration, and the style of painting changed greatly. The most notable were Cao Buxing of Wu, Wei Xie of Jin, Gu Kaizhi, Lu Tanwei of Song, Xie He of the Southern Qi, Zhang Sengyao of Liang, Zhan Ziqian and Dong Boren of Sui, and Zheng Fashi, all of whom were talented and learned, and could use objects without being used by them. Lu, Zhang, and Zhan were notably called the Four Ancestors of painting.</p>
<p>Wei and Jin Dynasties</p>
<p>The paintings of the Wei, Jin, Southern, and Northern Dynasties gained nourishment from foreign thoughts and formats combined with the inherent spirit of the people. They suddenly presented an extremely healthy and full development, until the flourishing Tang Dynasty. The country was prosperous, the politics enlightened, and the articles and poems became the essence of the country; painting also advanced to the highest and most perfect realm. Su Shi inscribed on Wu Daozi's painting: "The wise create things, and the capable describe them, which cannot be done by one person alone. The gentleman in learning, and the craftsmen in art, from the Three Dynasties through the Han to the Tang, are complete. Therefore, poetry reached Du Zimei, writing reached Han Tuizhi, and painting reached Wu Daozi. The changes of ancient and modern times, and the abilities of the world, are exhausted." Su Shi had such a vision and review of Chinese culture, which was insightful. Tang paintings inherited from the Wei, Jin, and Six Dynasties, and opened up the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties; ghosts and gods, Taoism and Buddhism, figures, palaces, mountains and rivers, dragons and fish, livestock and beasts, flowers and birds, nothing was not complete, and nothing was not beautiful. Wu Daoxuan's figures are absolutely unsurpassed for a hundred generations; landscapes, trees, and rocks also opened up the Southern Song. The Yan brothers, "establishing virtue and establishing oneself," were the leaders of the time. Others such as Zhang Xuan's noble sons, Gu Hongzhong's ladies, Cao Ba and Han Gan's horses, Dai Song's oxen, Xue Ji's cranes, and Wei Yan's pine and rocks, were all specialized and reached their peaks. The division of landscapes into Northern and Southern Schools was rare in the early Tang Dynasty, and only became popular in the later period. Li Sixun and Wang Wei began to advocate pure landscape painting. Li Sixun's school emphasized fine and strong brushwork, opening up the method of blue-green color painting. Wang Wei's school emphasized unrestrained brushwork, creating the style of ink wash rendering. The trend of the times led to the development of their own unique spirits, and Chinese landscape painting thus had the division of the Northern and Southern Schools. Li Sixun was the head of the Northern School, and Wang Wei was the ancestor of the Southern School. Dong Qichang of the Ming Dynasty said: "The Chan sect has two schools, North and South, which began to be divided in the Tang Dynasty. The North and South Schools of painting were also divided in the Tang Dynasty. However, the people are not from the North and South. The Northern School is represented by Li Sixun and his son, who paint colored landscapes, which were passed down to Zhao Gan, Zhao Boju, and Zhao Bofu of the Song Dynasty. As for Ma Yuan, Xia Gui and others, the Southern School is represented by Wang Wei, who first used rendering to change the method of hooking and cutting, which was passed down to Zhang Zao, Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Guo Zhongshu, the Mi family father and son, and the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty..." The Northern School embodies changes in rigor, the brush is solid and the spirit is condensed, and the aura is particularly thick. The Southern School gradually gets rid of traces, the brush is unrestrained, and the aura is elegant and free. Li Sixun was a member of the Tang Dynasty clan and once served as General of the Wuwei, so he was called General Li. His son Zhaodao was meticulous in drawing boundaries, and the world called him Little Li. Wang Wei lived in Wangchuan, and wrote secret formulas for painting, saying: "In the way of painting, ink is the best, creating the nature of nature and achieving the function of creation." His artistic view can be seen in general. Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty said: "Tasting Wang Wei's poems, there is painting in the poems, and looking at Wang Wei's paintings, there is poetry in the paintings." He can be said to be a keen appraiser. Those who were influenced by Wang Wei include Lu Hong and Zheng Qian. Lu Hong lived in seclusion in Mount Song, and was known as a hermit of Mount Song. Zheng Qian was a poetry friend of Li Bai and Du Fu; Du Fu's poem said that "Lord Zheng's building scattered silk, and after drinking, he often called himself an old painter". Wang Qia's splashed ink landscapes also had a unique style. Xiang Rong and Bi Hong's pine breeze and spring stones were also great achievements in the art world.</p>
<p>At the end of the Tang Dynasty and the Five Dynasties, disasters followed each other, and the years were quite long. The painting academy was not as prosperous as in the Tang Dynasty, but there were also many masters who surpassed the past and present. Jing Hao and Guan Tong's landscapes, Xu Xi, Xu Chongsi, Huang Quan, Huang Jucai, Zhou Wenju, Zhao Chang, Yi Yuanji's flowers and birds, and Guan Xiu's Buddhist images and strange beasts, were all unsurpassed for a hundred generations and were masters of painting.</p>
<p>Two Songs</p>
<p>Painting reached the Five Dynasties, inheriting the simplicity of the Tang Dynasty, and newly opening up the body of transcendence, elegance, and exquisiteness. When the people of the Song Dynasty came out, they gathered their great achievements. Therefore, painting in the Song Dynasty was more prosperous than in the Tang Dynasty, and it was indeed the golden age in the history of Chinese art. In 976 AD, Emperor Taizong of the Song Dynasty ordered the world to search for famous works, and set up a secret pavilion in the Chongwen Academy to treasure famous paintings of ancient and modern times. By the time of Emperor Huizong, he ordered the compilation of the Xuanhe Painting Manual, collecting the paintings in the palace, totaling 6,396 scrolls, and analyzing them into ten categories according to the types of paintings. The Song Dynasty paid attention to painting, and it lasted for three hundred years without decline. There were many geniuses, and schools arose.</p>
<p>The landscape paintings of the Song Dynasty surpassed those of the Tang Dynasty. Talents emerged, and they became unique in ancient and modern times, and were most representative of the art of China's prosperous era. Tracing back to the landscape paintings of the early Tang Dynasty, they were only detached from the background of ancient figures and became independent, and their art had not yet reached its peak. Since Wang Wei, Zhang Zao, Bi Hong, and Zheng Qian and others came out, they deeply studied their principles; in the Five Dynasties, Jing Hao and Guan Tong also came up with new ideas and washed away the old habits. By the time of Dong Yuan, Li Cheng, and Fan Kuan of the Song Dynasty, the three families stood side by side, opening up the forms and bone methods that the Tang people did not have, and their painting style influenced later generations and has not been abandoned to this day. Dong Qichang said: "Song paintings reached the point of painting giant landscapes, completely getting rid of the habit of being trivial and detailed, and all using ink to dye the clouds, with the momentum of swallowing and changing. Jing Hao and Guan Tong have both brush and ink; Dong Yuan and Ju Ran have both brush and ink, but it is as if there is no brush and no ink. Li Cheng of Yingqiu and Fan Kuan of Huayuan stand between Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran. At that time, it was said that Dong Yuan got the spirit of the mountains, Li Cheng got the marrow appearance, and Fan Kuan got the bone method, exhausting the changes. The Southern School reached this point, and it was almost divine. Guan Tong's disciple Wang Duan, and Yingqiu's disciples Song Di, Xu Daoning, and Guo Xi all got one of his styles, and they were already outstanding masters. Gao Keming did not reach the level of Dong Yuan and Li Cheng, but he was also called a worthy talent. Guo Zhongshu's several peaks were outside the sky, and they were formed by washing ink, which was even more strange than Wang Qia's splashed ink. Mi Fu's source came from Dong Yuan, and he did not fall into stereotypes. He claimed that he did not have a bit of Wu Daozi's habits." His words can best clarify the position and value of Song Dynasty landscape paintings. The highest ideals of the Song people for nature and life were all realized in landscape paintings.</p>
<p>Dong Yuan's color followed Li Sixun, and his ink was similar to Wang Wei, but he came out of his own mind, with varied rendering and dripping ink, and was indeed the ancestor of Mi Fu's paintings. Those who passed on his method include Ju Ran, Jiang Can, Xiao Zhao, Liu Daoshi, and others. Huang Gongwang, Ni Zan, and Wang Meng of the Yuan Dynasty also distantly followed the spirit of Beiyuan. Li Cheng combined blue and green ink into one, and Guo Xi also liked to do so. The painters of the painting academy competed to follow his method. His school was not only followed by Xu Daoning, Song Di, Guo Xi, Gao Keming, Yan Wengui, and others, but its origin flowed to the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. Fan Kuan first studied Li Cheng, and then studied Jing Hao. Then he sighed and said, "It is better to learn from nature than to learn from people." Therefore, he lived in the mountains of Zhongnan and Taishi for ten years, witnessing the changes of clouds and smoke, shade and sunshine, and then got rid of his old habits and gained the natural interest alone; he was especially good at snow mountains, which made people shiver when they saw them. In his later years, he used heavy ink, and he liked to make dense forests on the top of the mountain. Those who passed on his painting school include Guo Zhongshu and Tian Zongyuan.</p>
<p>Commentators say that the landscape paintings of the Song Dynasty surpassed those of the Tang Dynasty, and there are the above three schools. The leaders of the schools all had their own unique talents, which could not be concealed by the ancients. When Mi Fu and his son Youren came out, they created their own techniques, painting cloud mountains with magical changes, and their names shook the times. He once said: "After Bo Shi's right hand was sick, I began to paint. Li Gonglin often took Wu Daozi as his teacher, but he could not get rid of his habits. I then took the ancients, and did not allow a single stroke to enter Wu Daozi." He also said that the landscapes of ancient and modern times were similar to each other, and there were few transcendent styles, so he did it with a brush, mostly with smoke and clouds, and the gods of great air fluctuations. Dong Qichang said: "Poetry reached Du Fu, calligraphy reached Yan Zhenqing, and painting reached the two Mis. The changes of ancient and modern times, and the abilities of the world, are exhausted." How true are these words!</p>
<p>The academy style was created in the Five Dynasties, with fine workmanship and elegance, and meticulous rules. At the end of the Northern Song Dynasty and the beginning of the Gaozong era, the brothers Zhao Boju and Bofu inherited the legacy of the Northern Song Dynasty and carried it forward. Their brushwork was as fine as cow hair, extremely delicate, ingenious, and neat, thus establishing a new banner for the Southern Song Dynasty painting academy. Li Tang, Liu Songnian, Ma Yuan, and Xia Gui were called the Four Masters of the Southern Crossing. Commentators say that their workmanship is too skillful, and they do not pay much attention to them.</p>
<p>The Taoist and Buddhist figure paintings of the two Songs were influenced by the academy paintings, and their style became increasingly refined. Famous artists such as Sun Mengqing, Sun Zhiwei, Chen Yongzhi, Feng Qing, and Li Derou were able to get rid of the constraints of Indian paintings and form their own school in their Buddhist paintings. The most peculiar was the monk Muqi, who was good at light ink Guanyin, dragons and tigers, flowers and birds, and was capable of everything. His ink was as colorful as paint. Jia Shigu learned the neat and skillful style of Li Gonglin, which was passed down to Liang Kai. Liang Kai also created a new style of reduced-brush painting, creating landscapes, figures, Buddhist and Taoist gods, apes and other pictures. His use of ink was ancient and could not be reached.</p>
<p>It is difficult to combine all six principles of painting. After Wu Daozi, only Li Gonglin was able to combine them. Gonglin's Buddhist images directly approached Wu Daozi, and his landscapes were clear and beautiful, and were the true biography of Wang Wei. His colored landscapes were also like Li Sixun, and he especially liked to paint galloping horses and flying dragons, and he was indeed able to gather the great achievements of various schools.</p>
<p>Since the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan and Xu Xi have each established new banners for flower and bird paintings, which flourished in the Song Dynasty. Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty was a genius, with clear and strong outlines, and ancient and beautiful colors. As for the ink plays of literati, they mostly created withered trees, plum blossoms, orchids, bamboos, and chrysanthemums, and their brushstrokes were unrestrained in the desolate and uninhabited realm, and Wen Tong and Su Shi were the most famous.</p>
<p>Yuan Dynasty</p>
<p>The Yuan Dynasty, as a foreign race, ruled China. Although there was no painting academy, painting was very prosperous. It inherited the legacy of the previous dynasties, and opened up the new style of painting in the Ming, Qing, and modern times; it especially advocated a light, leisurely, and detached style. If we analyze the history of Chinese painting by ancient, middle, and modern times, and seek the path of its artistic development and evolution, and examine its relics, then we should separate the period before the Han Dynasty as ancient, the Six Dynasties to the Tang, Song, and Yuan as middle, and the Ming and Qing as modern. The paintings before the Tang Dynasty are not easy to see; therefore, those who talk about ancient paintings always say Song and Yuan. Although the Hu people destroyed the Song Dynasty, and the Manchus destroyed the Ming Dynasty, they only gained political power for a while, and there was no obstacle to the development of culture and art. Therefore, the Yuan Dynasty inherited the style of the Song Dynasty, and the Qing Dynasty led the style of the Ming Dynasty. Han culture continued to advance, and the Hu and Man people were instead assimilated. Is not the power of the Han people to interact with people so great! As for the paintings of the Yuan Dynasty, the most famous of the works passed down today are Zhao Mengfu, Gao Kegong, Qian Xuan, and Wang Ruoshui. Zhao Mengfu was proficient in both calligraphy and painting, and invented the theory that calligraphy and painting have the same origin. His ancient and subtle figures, horses, landscapes, and bamboo and stones deeply captured the interest of the Jin and Tang Dynasties. Dong Qichang said: "Zhao Mengfu's painting style has the charm of the Tang people, removing its delicacy; and has the magnificence of the Northern Song Dynasty, removing its roughness." His wife Guan Daosheng, son Zhongmu, brother Zhongguang, and Zhongmu's sons Yunwen and Yanwei were all famous for a time, and it was a beautiful story in the art world. Gao Kegong inherited the style of Mi Fu in the Northern Song Dynasty, and was good at light ink landscapes; Qian Xuan and Wang Yuan were the masters of flowers and birds. Qian Xuan admired the style of Zhao Chang and Yi Yuanji, and was a master of Xu Xi's style; Wang Yuan specialized in the elegance of Huang Quan's style. If they can inherit the works of their predecessors, and show future generations the classics. As for the orchids and bamboos of Li Xizhai and Ke Jiusi after Zhao Mengfu, they are also branches of Su Shi and Wen Tong.</p>
<p>When the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty Huang Gongwang, Wang Meng, Ni Zan, and Wu Zhen came out, they used their lofty and unrestrained brushstrokes to express the mountains and valleys in their hearts, remotely following the methods of Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran, and closely taking the meaning of Yingqiu and Huayuan; thus, they became the ultimate expression of landscape painting in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Huang Gongwang had two painting styles in his life: one that was made with light ochre, with mountains mostly made of stones, and the brushstrokes were vigorous and thick; and one that was made with ink, with extremely sparse wrinkles. In Huang Gongwang's quiet, simple, and distant strokes, he felt the joy of life. The predecessors also said: "Entrusting happiness to painting began with Huang Gongwang." Wu Zhen created the method of wet dot moss, gaining the essence of the Song people; therefore, his brushstrokes were bold and free, without a bit of worldly air. Wang Meng was the nephew of Zhao Mengfu, and his painting style was very similar to that of his uncle. He was also influenced by Wang Wei, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran's ink methods; his brushwork also evolved from Guo Xi's rolled cloud wrinkles, with bright and pleasant colors. His works mostly have overlapping peaks, winding paths, and misty clouds, which fully express the secluded charm. Ni Zan said that his brush strength could lift a tripod, and there has been no such person in five hundred years, which is believable. Among the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty, Ni Zan's works have the highest quality and can be called the most extreme literati paintings. He once said: "What I call painting is nothing more than casual brushstrokes, not seeking to resemble, just to entertain myself." He is the only one after Mi Fu who is ancient, plain, and innocent. Looking at his paintings is like passing through gardens, forests, and valleys, and ascending to the fairyland of Penglai. Today's people only focus on the complexity or simplicity of imitating Ni Zan, which is superficial.</p>
<p>Ming Dynasty</p>
<p>The Zhu Ming Dynasty unified the world after the Hu Yuan, and continued the legacy of the Zhao Song Dynasty. The imperial court re-established the painting academy, and Bian Wenjin, Fan Huan, and others used flowers and birds, and Guo Chun used landscapes, and were summoned to serve in the Yongle Inner Hall. The Xuande Painting Academy was the most prosperous period of the Ming Dynasty, echoing the Xuanhe and Shaoxing periods of the Song Dynasty. The talents of the painting academy included Xie Huan, Shang Xi, Dai Jin, Li Zai, and Zhou Wenjing, who all served directly in the Renzhi Hall. Dai Jin's unique skills can be called the famous hand of the Ming Dynasty. Lin Liang and Lin Chun's father and son were masters of the freehand school in the painting academy. During the Chenghua period, Wu Wei, Lu Ji, and Lu Wenying all served directly in the Renzhi Hall. Wu Wei was praised for his paintings and was awarded the title of Jinyi Hundred Household and the title of Number One Scholar in Painting. Lu Ji and Lu Wenying were called Big Lu and Little Lu; Zhang Yi was also famous in the Hongzhi Painting Academy. During the Zhengde period, there were Wang E and Zhu Duan, who both served directly in the Renzhi Hall. Wang E was called Ma Yuan of the time. At the beginning of the Wanli period, Wang Yance entered the painting academy, and Gu Bing served in the Inner Hall. The influence of the Ming Dynasty painting academy was no less than that of the Song Dynasty, but its painting style was no longer that of the Song and Yuan Dynasties.</p>
<p>The landscape paintings of the Ming Dynasty collected the styles of Wang Wei and others, Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Yingqiu, the two Mis, Zhao Mengfu, Gao Kegong, and even the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty. Those who have the typical literati style are called the Wu School. Since Dong Qichang and Shen Hao, this school has been called the Southern School, and it is regarded as the painting of literati and scholar-officials. The Zhejiang School, Dai Jin, and the academy style Zhou Chen are named the Northern School. And it is said that the academy style has strange and steep bones, dry and hard strokes, and has the Zen of wild foxes, which is not what we should learn. This is the view of the school, not a definite argument. The division of paintings into North and South Schools probably started with Dong Qichang. However, since the Tang Dynasty, how can the landscape paintings of the past dynasties be exhausted by this one or two changes! The two major systems divided by Dong Qichang may not have seen this. Even if ink is said to be the characteristic of the Southern School, how can the Northern School, Ma Yuan and Xia Gui, not specialize in ink; the plain and unrestrained composition and coloring are the beauty of both the North and South Schools. The world calls Li Sixun the general, and he is also a scholar-official painter. Looking at the Northern School painters of the past, they are all literati; the Southern School painters, who take painting as a career, are also often seen. Therefore, the difference and evaluation of the North and South Schools are the result of the infighting between the Wu School and the Zhejiang School in the Ming Dynasty. It is really the view of the school in the Han and Song Dynasties, and the literati despise each other, which has been the case since ancient times. Literati commented on paintings, favoring the South and degrading the North, and the trend was extremely prosperous for a time. Shen Zhou and Wen Zhengming were highly regarded in the art world, so there were few who called the Wu School; because most of the great masters of this school were from Wu. After the Jiajing period, Dong Qichang and Chen Jiru and others came out, inheriting the legacy of Shen Zhou and Wen Zhengming, and carrying it forward with all their strength, thus forming a major trend of thought in the history of Chinese painting, and the Zhejiang School had almost no foothold. After the Wanli period, Dong Qichang unified the painting world, and the influence was continuous throughout the Qing Dynasty, and its momentum can be seen in general. Shen Zhou's talent was outstanding, and he obtained it from nature, so he was able to exhaust the mysteries of famous artists from the Tang and Song Dynasties for thousands of years. Wang Chideng praised Shen Zhou and said: "Stop! How brilliant! Mr. Shen's works gather great achievements, and are they the ones who gather the sounds of metal and jade!" Wen Zhengming also came out of Shen Zhou's school, and his landscapes combined the strengths of Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Zhao Mengfu, and Ni Zan, and his spirit and charm were superior. Although he was very similar to Zhao Mengfu, he had a kind of clear, harmonious, and leisurely interest. Commentators said that this was due to his noble character. Wen Zhengming was friendly with Wu Kuan, Zhu Yunming, and Tang Yin, and they were like one day for thirty years; his sons Pengjia and Zibo Ren, were all excellent in calligraphy and painting, and the family learning was inherited, which can be said to be prosperous.</p>
<p>Zhou Chen was a transition from the academy style to the Wu School of painting style. The figures were ancient and strange, and the landscape was steep, directly chasing Li Tang; Tang Yin and Qiu Ying were both from his school. Tang Yin's landscapes and figures were all wonderful, and he obtained the methods of Liu Songnian and Li Xigu. His brushstrokes were delicate and meticulous, and he had a charm. He was able to follow the rules and principles, and sharply come out of the natural mechanism. Since those who learn from the Northern School have a writer's habit, Tang Yin alone contains the essence, and his childlike innocence fills the paper. He is actually a follower of the Northern School with the appearance of the Southern School. In addition, there are Wang Mian and Wang Yi, who are literati and scholars who are good at artistic affairs. Wang Mian's paintings of plum blossoms and bamboos are clear, beautiful, ancient, and lofty. Wang Yi's landscapes followed the style of Huang He, and his distant mountains on the Yangtze River, strange stones, and cliffs were called the first at the time. Next to him was Xia Chang, the Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, who was famous for his ink bamboo, and his literary name was well-known. During the Jiajing and Wanli periods, there were Qian Gu, Xiang Yuanbian, Sun Kehong, Mo Shilong, Xu Wei, Zhou Tianqiu, Xie Shichen, Lu Zhi, Zhao Diguang, Wang Siqian, Zhang Ruitu, Li Shida, Li Liufang, Mi Wanzhong, Sheng Maoye, Wu Bin, and others, who were too many to count. Qian Shubao's poems, books, and paintings were all instructed by Wen Zhengming, and his strokes and moss dots were calm and meticulous. Xiang Molin was erudite and knowledgeable, and was good at appreciation and rich in collections. His landscapes, orchids, and bamboos were light and elegant, and had an unrestrained interest. Mo Yunqing and Gao Jie were otherworldly. Sun Xueju's landscapes, flowers, and plants were all wonderful. Xu Tianchi splashed ink dripping, and his brushstrokes were unrestrained. Zhou Tianqiu wrote poems and had the air of a painting scroll. Xie Shichen's method of painting stones was varied and varied. Li Changheng's landscapes had a clear and elegant atmosphere, and his unrestrained spirit was flying; he was called the Four Gentlemen of Jiading together with Tang Shisheng, Lou Jian, and Cheng Jiasui. Wu Wenzhong's brushstrokes were meticulous, and his strength was elegant. His character was high, so his art was naturally free of vulgarity. There are very few landscapes handed down, so they are very precious. Mi Wanzhong and Zhang Ruitu's Cangrun, Lu Baoshan's Qiqiao, and Li Shida's Puhou were all able to establish their own styles and separate from Wen Zhengming. Others such as Jiang Song and Zhang Lu's learning of the Song and Yuan Dynasties was inevitably wild, and was not admired by the world, so the Huating School followed. The leader of the Huating School was Dong Qichang. Dong Qichang was a high-ranking official in the Ministry of Rites, and his posthumous title was Wenzhen. At that time, his books and paintings were all called unsurpassed, surpassing Zhao Mengfu, so his strokes had a chic and outstanding outline. His paintings were neither Song nor Yuan, and he reversed the times. He was better than the Yuan sages Zhu Derun and Tang Zi. Hua was better than Cao Yunxi and Qian Xuan, with a vast and ancient style, and his bones were beautiful and developed. His ink method was especially unique. He was good at rhythm. He once said: "Charm cannot be learned, it is known by birth, and it is naturally endowed; however, there is also a place to learn, read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles, get rid of dust and turbidity in the chest, and naturally build mountains and valleys, and immediately become rugged, and write it out at hand, all for landscape painting." Those who imitated Dong Qichang, from Zhao Wendu down, there were dozens of families, all at the same time as Dong. Dong Qichang was called the Four Masters of the Ming Dynasty along with Shen Zhou, Wen Zhengming, and Tang Yin. From the Wanli period to the Chongzhen period, there were Chen Jiru, Cheng Jiasui, Ni Yuanlu, Yun Xiang, Huang Daozhou, Yang Wencong, Qi Biaojia, Song Xu, Shen Shichong, Gu Zhengyi, Bian Wenyu, Shao Mi, Wang Jianzhang, and others. Chen Meigong was unrestrained and elegant, his brushstrokes were vast and simple, and he did not eat human fireworks. Cheng Mengyang was erudite and had a high character, and his landscapes followed the style of Huang Gongwang, and he was known for his plumpness. Ni Yuanlu and Huang Daozhou were both known in the world for their poems, books, and calligraphy, and their landscapes, pine trees, and rocks were ancient and unconventional, and did not eat human fireworks. "The river flows outside the heavens and the earth, and the colors of the mountains are in the midst of nothingness." Only those who understand this poem can appreciate the paintings of Ni Yuanlu and Huang Daozhou. Yang Wencong was also known for his landscapes, bamboos, and rocks. The three families were all martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country in the late Ming Dynasty, and their integrity and articles were shining in the world, so their handwriting was especially valued by the world, and only with a great personality can there be great art. Yun Xiang's landscapes came from Dong Yuan and formed their own family. Qi Biaojia learned poetry and books from Dong Qichang, and his paintings were quite neat. Zhao Wendu followed the style of Song Xu. Shen Shichong came from Zhao Wendu's school, and his calligraphy and painting had the interest of smoke and clouds changing. The above families who have trained in the Su Song School, Gu Zhengyi and others, are called the Huating School, and all have the style of Dong Qichang. Bian Wenyu's landscapes, trees, and rocks have an ancient meaning, and Shao Gua Chou and Wang Jianzhang are both good at calligraphy and painting. Dong Xuanzai was ranked first in Wu Meicun's Song of Nine Friends in Painting, and Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Li Liufang, Yang Wencong, Cheng Jiasui, Zhang Xuehui, Bian Wenyu, Shao Mi and others all belonged to it. From this, there is another distinction between the Yunjian School and the Loudong School in the Wu School. Wang Lutai said: "Most of the painters in the late Ming Dynasty were unrestrained and elegant, and established their own halls, changing the appearance of the Song and Yuan Dynasties." Is it not true!</p>
<p>In addition to the freehand ink painting schools of Bian Wenjin and Lu Ji, and Lin Liang's father and son, there are Shen Zhou, Chen Chun, Lu Zhi, and Zhou Zhimian in the Ming Dynasty. Shen Zhou's flowers and plants are light and boneless, and the colors and ink are all complete, forming a separate style, which is the beginning of the literati school of flowers and plants in the Ming Dynasty. Chen Baiyang, Lu Baoshan, and Zhou Zhimian all came from Shen Zhou. Xu Wei, mentioned earlier, also created many flowers and plants, and was as magical as Chen Chun, and was unrestrained and elegant.</p>
<p>In figure painting, there were Jiang Zicheng before, and then there was Ruan Fu. During the Wanli period, there were Ding Yunpeng, Wu Bin, and Wu Tingyu. Ding NanYu was erudite and capable, and was good at the white drawing of Buddhist images and Arhats. Wu Wenzhong was also good at white drawing Arhats, so the twenty-five round diagrams collected by the palace are simple, primitive, and exquisite, and they are lifelike. The first great master of figure painting in the Ming Dynasty was Qiu Ying. Qiu Ying was the most skilled in ladies and genre paintings, and his arrangements were appropriate, and the scenes were lifelike, which was a new style in figure painting. As for buildings, flags, chariots, saddles, horses, and the like, they were also extremely precise and vivid, not inferior to Zhao Mengfu. There are not many who can pass on Qiu Ying's paintings, except for his daughter Du Lingneishi. You Qiu, Cheng Huan, and Shi Rui were all influenced by him. By the end of the Ming Dynasty, Cui Zizhong and Chen Hongshou came out and created a new style of figure painting. They were called Southern Chen and Northern Cui at the time, and they were the great masters of figure painting after Qiu Ying, and they opened a new era of figure painting in the Qing Dynasty. The famous person for portraiture was Zeng Jing, who caused a sensation for a while. In the tenth year of Wanli, the Italian priest Matteo Ricci came to the dynasty and was able to paint the image of the Virgin Mary. Zeng Jing then reconciled his method and created portraits, which is the so-called Bocen school of portraiture.</p>
<p>Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>When the Manchus entered the pass and ruled China, the system and culture mostly followed the old Ming Dynasty, and the artistic trend of thought also continued the legacy of the previous generations. Since Shen Zhou and Wen Zhengming in the Ming Dynasty, the Wu School flourished. Dong Qichang and Chen Jiru rose up, and their great reputation suppressed the art world. The theory of painting still favored the South and degraded the North, which was popular for a while. Therefore, in the Qing Dynasty, the art world was dominated by the Southern School for almost three hundred years, which was not without reason. Only in the late Ming Dynasty and early Qing Dynasty, the Zhejiang School's inheritance was carried on, and the crudeness of Jiang Song and others was washed away, opening up the beautiful style of vigor, solidity, precision, and research in Qing Dynasty landscape painting. The one who was the driving force of the Zhejiang School and emerged prominently was Lan Ying. His son Lan Tao, Lan Meng, and Yu Zhiding all passed on his painting style. In addition to the Zhejiang School, there is also the Yuan School, which specializes in the painting of buildings, namely Yuan Jiang and Yuan Yao, Yuan Xue, who were court painters during the Yongzheng period. After the three families, it has become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang School has declined and declined, and the Wu School has reached the extreme of change in the early Qing Dynasty, so the Southern School is unified. The most famous in the Qing Dynasty painting world are the Six Great Masters of the early Qing Dynasty. Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Yuanzhao, and Wang Hui all inherited Dong Qichang. Wang Shimin exhausted the mysteries of Huang Gongwang, and the world said that he had obtained the true Dharma Eye Store of Huang Gongwang. Wang Yuanzhao was calm, ancient, and unrestrained, and strove to follow the Yuan people. Wang Hui, Wu Li, and Wang Yuanzhao came out of Wang Shimin's school, integrating the North and South, and did not fall into clichés; although their qualities were different, their charm was the same. Wang Yuanqi said: "Wu Li's achievements are not below Wang Shimin." It is not a false statement. However, one is famous throughout the world, and is honored as the ancient and modern painting saint, while the other is unknown, and later there are even those who do not know who Wu Li is. Is it not lamentable! Yun Shouping and Yun Ge breathed the spirit of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, and their charm was transcendent. In order to avoid Wang Hui, he did boneless sketching. Wang Yuanqi also followed the Song and Yuan Dynasties, and directly chased Huang Gongwang. The four Wangs and Wu Li cast the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties into a single body, and their flow has spread to this day, occupying a special position in the history of painting. The leader of the six families is Wang Shimin, and his paintings have a special purpose. He was praised by Dong Qichang and Chen Jiru at the time. His landscapes are outlined and brushed, and they are ethereal and divine. His random dots and dyes, and his hills are natural, deep, quiet, and his tenderness is like gold. Only Wang Shimin has this achievement in the art world. Those who passed on Wang Sh</p>
<h3>A Concrete Method</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The meaning of health has two aspects: one is the passive aspect of not easily contracting diseases; the other is the active aspect of being able to endure hardship. The relationship between citizens and the country is like that between cells and the body. The foundation of the nation lies in its people, and the foundation of the people lies in their well-being. There has never been a case where a nation can sustain itself if its citizens are unhealthy, nor a case where a body can continue to live if its cells deteriorate. Only with healthy citizens can there be a healthy nation. How can people be healthy? This question cannot be solved with empty words. There must be cooperation between the government and the people, with the government promoting from above and private doctors assisting from below, taking practical steps to implement effective measures. I have now formulated a concrete method and written it below:</p>
<p>Belonging to the Government</p>
<p>The government's responsibilities are twofold: one is to eliminate factors that threaten health; the other is to build a broad path to promote health. There are three major enemies that threaten health: one is disease, the second is opium, and the third is war.</p>
<p>(A) Passive Measures</p>
<p>(I) Regarding Disease</p>
<p>The greatest enemy of health is disease. Therefore, the more unhealthy a nation is, the more diseases it will have and the higher its mortality rate will be. Why is this? It is simply because the people lack knowledge of hygiene, resulting in the succession of infectious diseases. When they are not sick, they have no preparations for prevention, and when they are sick, they often die needlessly due to the underdevelopment of medical services, such as the insufficient number of doctors and the scarcity of hospitals. A nation like this will naturally decline day by day. The remedies are as follows:</p>
<p>Epidemic Prevention Vaccination: Any widespread epidemic is called "yi" (epidemic). However, cholera and smallpox are found more frequently in China every year, so the term "fangyi" (epidemic prevention) seems to specifically refer to these two diseases. Cholera is more common in summer and autumn, while smallpox is more prevalent in spring and winter. In recent years, due to widespread vaccination, the severity of the epidemic has not been as rampant as before. However, compulsory vaccination may not be without contraindications. Many conditions, such as progressive pulmonary tuberculosis, myocarditis, nephritis, diabetes, gastric ulcers, and old age and weakness, are not suitable for injection. Such patients may experience severe reactions after vaccination, leading to the aggravation of the underlying disease, or even death. Among millions of people undergoing universal vaccination, there are inevitably some sacrifices. Although there are no statistics, such incidents are occasionally heard and seen. Therefore, prior examination is essential, and blind vaccination is not advisable. Also, smallpox is more common in children, and rarely seen in adults. Compulsory vaccination may be justifiable for children, but seems unnecessary for adults.</p>
<p>Traveler Quarantine: Epidemics are often spread from one place to another, or from one country to another, by travelers carrying pathogens. Many diseases did not exist in China originally but came from foreign countries. Therefore, travelers arriving by sea, land, or air should be quarantined, especially ships arriving from overseas, which should be subject to strict inspection to prevent the spread of foreign diseases into China.</p>
<p>Anti-Tuberculosis Movement: The mortality rate from tuberculosis is the highest in China, at least in Shanghai, and the economic losses to the country are also the greatest. The government should establish sanatoriums in scenic areas to isolate these patients. However, the most fundamental and effective method of preventing tuberculosis is BCG vaccination. This method is easy to implement, and the effect of lifelong immunity can be obtained by vaccinating newborns three times within ten days after birth (this vaccine can be obtained from the Pasteur Institute on Jin Shenfu Road in Shanghai, free of charge). It is a good and beautiful method, but unfortunately unknown to most people.</p>
<p>Prostitute Inspection: Venereal diseases, especially syphilis, are the most widespread and harmful, causing harm to oneself and disaster to future generations. The number of miscarriages in women or infant deaths due to this cause is immeasurable. Prostitutes are the source of venereal diseases. Banning prostitution is a fundamental solution, but it is difficult to achieve in reality. A better approach is to inspect prostitutes regularly. If they are found to be potentially infectious, their services should be temporarily suspended. Meanwhile, venereal disease clinics should be established to treat them. Although this may not eradicate venereal diseases, it can reduce their spread.</p>
<p>Improving the Lives of the Poor: In the past twenty years, the dissemination of hygienic knowledge in China seems to have achieved considerable success. However, only the middle and upper classes are aware of hygiene, while the countless poor people do not even have enough food and clothing, let alone hygiene. The middle and upper classes, despite guarding their bastions of hygiene, thinking that all infectious diseases can be avoided, are constantly being exposed to germs produced by the poor, who keep spreading the germs to them because of their overproduction. The solution to this situation is to improve the environment and improve the lives of this majority of the poor. Demolish their dark, prison-like dwellings and build the most economical and hygienic housing and dining places to solve their housing and food problems. For their diseases, establish free clinics and public hospitals to provide them with medical care.</p>
<p>Banning Quack Medicine: In general, all those who attempt to confuse the false with the genuine can be called "jianghu" (itinerant or unorthodox). Confucius said: "Words that are plausible but without substance, and actions that are deceptive but resolute, are only due to the lack of sincerity. Therefore, they can sway the ears of the world and gain the belief of society." Therefore, "jianghu" refers to those who rely on tricks rather than learning, and those who have the name but not the substance. Medicine also has its "jianghu," which often attracts attention with exaggerated advertisements and lures people to seek treatment. Although they may reap both fame and fortune, they also add some wrongly accused ghosts to the city of the unjustly dead. Therefore, the threat of "jianghu" medicine to health is no less than the havoc wreaked by germs.</p>
<p>(II) Regarding Opium</p>
<p>Since the Opium War, this disaster has spread to our country, causing the people's will to decline day by day and their bodies to weaken. In recent years, although the government has issued several bans on opium, addicts continue to consume, growers continue to cultivate, and transporters continue to transport. It has not achieved any significant effect. Now, the situation has worsened. Smoking dens are everywhere. In addition to opium, there are also morphine, heroin, red pills, and other toxic substances from the north. Their threat to health is self-evident. If the government does not resolve to eradicate them in the future, but only seeks temporary revenue, I fear that within a hundred years, there will be no people left to feed and the nation will be extinct.</p>
<p>(III) Regarding War</p>
<p>"War is dangerous and fraught with peril" is an ancient saying. To use flesh and blood against the intensity of artillery fire, it is rare for soldiers not to be crushed to pieces. Moreover, after a major war, there is bound to be a major epidemic, which is the greatest threat to health. We constantly seek an early victory and the early arrival of the god of peace, which would be a great blessing.</p>
<p>(B) Active Measures</p>
<p>Training the National Physique: The above are passive measures. Focusing solely on passive hygiene will still fail to achieve the goal of health. The active approach to hygiene is to promote exercise, train the body, and use the innate ability – resistance – to adapt to the environment and overcome it. Resistance is strengthened through use and weakened through disuse. By training the body, not only will health be improved, but heredity can also be altered. Many hereditary diseases that persist for generations can be prevented through exercise.</p>
<p>Promoting Eugenics: As the saying goes, "To have a strong country, one must first have a strong race." To actively improve the health of the people, the fundamental approach is to start with prudent marriages between young men and women. Before marriage, the bodies of both parties must be examined by a doctor to obtain a health certificate. Ideally, both parties should be strong. Alternatively, one strong and one weak is also acceptable. However, if both parties are weak, especially if they share the same weakness, then they should absolutely not marry.</p>
<p>Formulating Prohibition of Marriage Regulations: Prohibitions of marriage can be temporary or permanent. Temporary prohibitions of marriage apply to diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis, which should be absolutely prohibited before they are cured. Permanent prohibitions of marriage apply to congenital eunuchs or incurable terminal illnesses such as epilepsy and leprosy. In this way, weak genes will not be passed on, achieving the goal of eugenics.</p>
<p>Establishing Health Insurance: In recent years, the cost of living has risen sharply, and medical expenses have soared. The number of poor and sick people is increasing day by day. At this time, the so-called health care industry has emerged. Health care systems have a long history in Europe and the United States. Germany was the first to establish such a system, which was then adopted by other countries. France, after ten years of discussion, finally passed it through the parliament in 1930. The regulations formulated were no less than hundreds of articles. This type of system has a huge impact on the country and its people, so its creation required thorough consideration and strict regulations. The purpose of health care is solely to provide relief to the poor and sick and to protect the health of those living on low wages, rather than to engage in commercial profit-making. Therefore, this type of organization should be established by the state rather than by private individuals, with half of the funding provided by the government and the other half contributed by labor and capital. This is the most reasonable approach.</p>
<p>Lowering Grain and Commodity Prices: A shortage of grain and high commodity prices are detrimental to health. Guanzi said, "When the granaries are full, people will know etiquette." Today, each person only has one "sheng" (a unit of volume) of rice for every ten days, which is often not enough. As a result, everyone has a sallow complexion and cries out in hunger. How can one seek health without adequate nutrition? Is this not like heading north while pointing the carriage northward?</p>
<p>Belonging to Physicians</p>
<p>The above are all things that the government should do. Private physicians should play an assistive role, with their main function being to guide the people so that the government can effectively implement its policies.</p>
<p>Accurate Dissemination of Medical and Health Knowledge: Disseminating medical knowledge is a common saying in the medical community. However, at a time when official physicians have not yet implemented effective policies, quack doctors have already made extensive use of it. A few years ago, the supplements of various newspapers contained advertisements for quack medicine. These doctors published pseudo-scientific papers to steal fame and seek profit. How many people in society truly understand medicine and are not tempted by their advertisements and writings? Therefore, the dissemination of medical and health knowledge should focus on accuracy. Otherwise, whether one knows or does not know can make all the difference, and one must be cautious when it comes to the health of the nation!</p>
<p>Guidance on Marriage, Pregnancy, and Child Rearing: Physicians are responsible not only for curing diseases and treating individuals but also for providing guidance on health-related matters. The issues of marriage, pregnancy, and child rearing are of great importance to national health and should be addressed with guidance. Here are a few examples to illustrate the rest:</p>
<p>Today, many women advocate artificial contraception to avoid the pain of childbirth. Doctors should educate them with righteousness, telling them that pregnancy is a necessary process for women, which is beneficial and harmless to the body, and that many neurotic symptoms can be reduced by pregnancy.</p>
<p>Women who are afraid of the labor of breastfeeding hire wet nurses to replace them or feed their children cow's milk or formula. The drawbacks of this are innumerable, and doctors should also provide proper guidance.</p>
<p>Children are often spoiled after birth, leading to illness, or overfed with milk, leading to obesity. Doctors should often correct these misunderstandings. The Chinese proverb that "To keep a child healthy, always let him be three parts hungry and three parts cold" is not necessarily without reason. All these efforts are aimed at reducing infant mortality and achieving the goal that a strong country must first have a strong race.</p>
<p>Assistance in Implementing Health Policies: Physicians can directly assist in the implementation of the disease prevention work and anti-drug campaigns mentioned above, such as administering vaccinations, reporting infectious diseases, examining smokers, helping smokers quit, and reporting smokers.</p>
<p>In summary, although these are common platitudes, they are concrete measures to improve the health of the nation. Medical colleagues and I have repeatedly mentioned them over the past twenty years, but they have not yet been put into practice. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the Shen Bao's Double Ten Essay Competition, I have reorganized them, categorized them, and presented them for the reference of those concerned about medical and health affairs.</p>
