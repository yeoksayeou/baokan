<h3 id="c1">由華泰輪失事所得之教訓 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>華泰輪失事演成交通界之一大慘劇，令人痛心。關於善後問題以及責任問題，均正在各方面硏究與檢討之中，希望其不久有嚴正與完密之辦法，付諸實施。雖然，死者不可復生，而吾人內心因此次慘劇所受之創痛，亦永無平復之日。但悲慘之來，必為荒淫怠惰之結果，若能於悲慘之中，接受敎訓，滋生毅力，根除此次慘劇之眞止原因，而防止此後同類事件之發生，或更能由悲慘之中，追求事理，觸類旁通，擴大其所得之效用，對於各界之事態，知綢繆於未雨之道，則死者雖抱無涯之撼，究竟尙有所供獻，生者雖創鉅痛深，畢竟稍有所慰藉。否則慘劇將層出不窮而愈演愈慘，終必與華泰輪之旅客同其命運，遲早遭滅頂喪生之禍，雖其形式可以各異，而其可哀則一也。</p>
<p>交通事業之功用，必須具備其條件（見本報本月二日社評）而後能盡量發揮，對於客運尤須以安全為第一。中國內河輪船，除在較大之地點設有碼頭或毫船外，往往因陋就簡，直接利用舢舨，供乘客上下之用，且或在深夜之中，朦朧撲素。縱使船員旅客恪守規律，亦巳危險萬狀，尤其對於婦人老弱·更不堪設想。新港情形亦復如期，故此後應注意設備上之改進，以策安全。</p>
<p>凡章則之規定，均須切實執行。若求一時之通融，或求便於完遂其私慾，致執行者以及監督者均視章則為具文，終致釀成慘劇，實為不可避免之後果。例如華泰輪乘客之限額為五百三十八人，而事實上竟超出一倍以上，寗非荒謬。故此後應提創守法之精神，以求整飭，固不特交通界為然！</p>
<p>據此次生還之旅客所述，船員需索旅容之規費，將貨品於甲板上堆積如山，而使船易傾側，遇有偏倚遂無法保持平衡，以致肇禍。在當時船員利用其地位，壓榨乘客，未嘗不志得意滿，談判勒索，面目猙獰，若猛虎之與羔羊，毫無憐惜假借之餘地。公司方面亦樂得裝痴裝聾，且利用其能就地敲詐而不再考慮船員待遇之改善。船員之目無法紀，實由公司之間接放任所造成。今也船身下沈，公司固損失其營業之工具，而船員之隨旅客葬身魚腹者，亦必大有人在。倘死而有知，則船員之悔恨或有甚於旅客者。江心同舟，生死與共，又何必置人於不可喘息之地，至同歸於盡而後休。今之類船員之愚者多矣，惜乎巳在「舷門進水」之際，猶未澈悟而稍欽其見橫之態，必至「減頂」而　悔，不亦太晚歟？吾人實不暇為旅客哀而哀船員，或且不暇為船員哀而哀自身。凡處於共同利害之人羣，其各自省，幸勿以强凌弱，而稍斂跡，此為華泰輪失事應得之最大敎訓。</p>

<p>盤谷二十一日中央社電　二十一日為日·泰締盟二周年紀念，新泰政府曾於是日上午十時皋行紀念典禮，並招待日方關係長官，屆時到有畢本首相，培　法國防相以下全體閣僚，政軍首腦等及日方坪上駐泰大使，柴部隊長，山田，小倉陸軍武官等，畢木首相行　香致辭，表答決意，繼之坪上大使之答辭後，即同赴外交部共舉祝杯。又因本日亦為日·泰文化協定批准交換一周年紀念日，故泰方復曾於下午四時在國家文　院舉行慶祝茶會，下午七時起，復曾於外交部舉行締結同盟二周年慶視夜雙會。</p>
<p>盤谷二十一日中央社電百·泰同盟二周年紀念典禮席上，泰國畢本首相致辭及日駐泰坪上大使答辭，要旨如下：</p>
<p>泰首相致辭</p>
<p>泰國因明確任　日本帝國爲向設立足於相互　重自由獨立之大東亞共榮閱，且有澈底芟除惡勞力之崇高精神·故於開戰之始，即行倔起，誓願與日本同生共死，過去泰國亦與亞洲各國相同，曾不斷反抗帝國主義之壓迫，因此，深知其艱苦。泰國國民亦理解亞洲各民族無不希望實現友愛於共榮圈，因此二年前乃與日本簽訂該同盟條約，灑來日舉兩國即於軍事·政治·經濟及文化各方面全面協力。同時其他東亞各國家亦舉全力協力日本，余相信我等之協力，必可獲得最後之成果。</p>
<p>日大使答詞</p>
<p>日·泰兩國於開展第一年中，收獲空前未有之大戰果，於第二年中亦收獲可與第一年匹敵之偉大成果。同時，敵總反攻東亞之企圖到處受挫，反愈促進我共榮圍之建設與長期攻防態勢之整備，且敵陣營於戰敗之餘，相互　視猜　，其國內相尅益深。反之，我陣營之戰意與團結則日益昂揚强化。過去兩年之戰局推移與長期　定作戰計劃，完全一致，此等事實，愈使我人確信勝利，日本並欣然承認泰國合併馬來四州及撣部全州，泰國則與日本共同分担戰綫，或作經濟協力，或對日本供給基地。過去日。泰兩國解放大東亞之願望，因兩年來之苦鬥，刻巳着着實現，今東亞同煦各述所懷，對日·泰同盟之垂範束亞，巳有共鳴，紛與日木締盟，乃有大東亞會議之舉行，並發表五大原則·本大使於此，與畢本首相謹代表日·泰兩國國民宣誓，於今後戰鬥中，決舉全力，為大束亞之生存輿解放而奮鬥。</p>
<p>日外相祝詞</p>
<p>東京廿一日中央社電　日重光外相及靑木大東亞相，二十一日午假外相官　，共同主辦日泰同盟紀念午資會，除重光外相，靑木大東亞相外，參加者有泰駐日大使華德揚，泰國陸海空軍武官，日天羽情報局總裁，島田海相，杉山參謀總長，永野軍令部總長等多人。席間重光外相及華德揚大使曾分別致慶祝之詞，表明日。泰兩國對完遂大東亞戰爭之決意，茲誌重光外相致詞要旨如次：日本根本政策，即與東亞各國維持善那友好關係，故繼日·泰同盟條約之後，更有日。緬，日·菲條約及中·日同盟條約，彼此尊重主權獨立之締結，協力建設大東亞，此警鄰友好關係，經積極推進，巳將形成世界和平之基礎，前發表之大東亞共同宜言，對此巳予表明。日·泰兩國同處東亞，前未能熱於自然之親善關係者，即受第三者侵略所致，今亞洲巳覺　，敵　如何實打謀略宣傳及威嚇離問之策，亦無　可　矣。最近敵因反攻失敗，共窘狀畢露，日軍足以粉碎敵任何之攻擊，英·美之野心，在於榨取侵略東亞，制新世界，而吾人之戰爭目的，則爲保衛我鄉之天地，以貢獻於世界之進展，確信吾人之僧義定能以吾人之決意與實力達成。</p>

<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日靑木大東亞相二十一日與泰外相戴萊克作交換廣播，大意如次：</p>
<p>青木大東亞相</p>
<p>廣播大意謂：本年十一月，大東亞各國代表齊集東京，舉打大東亞會議，該會議表明此次戰爭之起因，乃英，美欲圖制　東亞所　，各國為期完遂戰爭　均表明互相協力之決意，英，美於此戰中雖屢遭參敗，然尤不斷反攻，但被日眾擊潰，日本不敗必勝之勢，更趨鞏固。自開戰以來，英，美人力方面損失四十萬之衆，在物資方面，計損失艦船杓二千二百艘，飛機約一萬一千架，數字之大，實屬罕有。英美之為政者，對戰死者之葬儀，竟禁止公開舉行，更不允死者遣族着用喪服·善英·美之為政者·自知此次對日戰爭，人物雙方受損　重、為掩飾其失策之罪賣特向國民出　　蔽之下策耳。現彼等國內對戰爭目的，發出詳論·自屬當然·故彼等現極感焦躁，急於企圖發動大規模反攻，但日本早巳料及、且有充分之對策，尤以明年度以後，敵之擴張生產力，將　　　·反之、日本生產力及戰力，則因加强國內決戰體制而確　增强·日本之戰略地位，亦益形鞏固，屆時對於澈底封鎭並拙被敵之反攻企圖、自具有充分把握也。故敵英美既對於戰爭前途日漸失却自信力，最近則積極施行謀略宜，但大東亞　民族基於道義與信義之團結力，極為鞏固，決不為英、美自利主義之宣傳謀略所　。固無待　言也。</p>
<p>泰外相戴萊克</p>
<p>廣播大意謂：吾人于二年前之紀念日，即與日本國民站於共同之命運上，為解放大東亞各民族及建設共榮圈而努力，因此泰國政府及泰國國民曾付與一切之犧牲，而泰國軍隊自是以來，即與日軍站在共同綫，在經濟，交化方面，亦曾為貫澈戰爭，集中總力，而協力日本。又大東並會議，各國家所通過之共同宜言，實係最重要之政治，外交文化為大東亞各國家在互相尊重獨立，尊重文化習憤，及經濟互助之原則下，團結一致，乃世界史上之重大事件，故使整個亞洲同胞對共榮圈建設·及戰爭之必　信念，愈益鞏固。泰國全國國民，一致在　本總理指導下，以盟邦日本站在共同戰綫奮鬥，確信吾人必能獲得最後勝利，同時今日亦係日，泰文化協定批准紀念日，可謂文化協定者，係進入兩國親善關係獲得兩國在將來之關榮與幸福者也。</p>

<p>阿根廷京城二十一日中央社電　據海通社訊：玻利維亞突然發生政變，總統卡斯蒂洛已被推翻，軍官一名指揮軍人五名，於前日逮捕總統及其親　數人，此次政變係「國民革命藥」及陸軍軍官所發動，而以塔波迦伊斯頓索羅等為領袖，民用航空業已阻斷，閣員二人亦在被捕之</p>
<p>阿根廷京城廿議日巾央社電　玻利維亞自發生錫鑛罷工事件以來，國內一部人士對總統卡斯蒂洛之反軸心政策愈現不滿，故廿日拂曉乃有伊斯頓衆羅領導之國民革命黨　起，四小時內即將總統官邸及其他地點包圍佔據，下午七時假廣播電台宣言「革命已獲勝利」。而將總統卡斯蒂洛國防部長　狄參謀長伊却衆等軟禁，聞伊斯頓索羅等已組成新政　，然　巴茲市內現仍為戒嚴狀態。各報社均駐有軍隊停止等刋。按總統卡斯蒂洛現年五十一歲，玻利維亞及巴拉圭作戰時，曾任玻軍參謀長，嗣於選舉總統時，國玻軍之支援而當選，因其親美故對軸心言戰，極富反國社黨色彩。</p>

<p>阿根廷京城二十一日中央社電　海通社訊，拉巴茲消息：玻利維亞叛黨在政府公署激烈辯論數小時後，已選舉維拉賽爾少校為玻利維亞臨時總統，國民黨議員伊斯頓索羅任財長，渠為發動政變之國民革命運動領袖之一。新政府發表告民衆稱，申　革命完全成功，壓迫民衆之舊政權業已推翻，新政府之成立純粹出於愛護祖國之熱悄，為民衆利益計，將着手於本團之經濟解放，大西洋　章及玻利維亞之國際義務均將加以尊重，外交政策亦不改變。前任總統卡斯蒂洛於昨日發表文吿，申遽渠依照人民輿陸軍之願望業已辭職。叛黨巳於前夜佔領政府公署，並逮捕卡斯蒂洛·國防部長康狄亞將軍，內長齊爾維蒂·及參謀總長伊却　等，彼等均被拘於私邸，前任總統卡斯蒂洛之兄弟二人，甫自美國歸來亦遭逮捕，由於革命政府之禁止，昨日各報均未出版。國民黨對於玻利維亞依賴美國之政策表示不滿，政府彈壓卡泰維礦區總罷工之措置，視為僅有利於美國，國民黨及陸軍軍官亦反對最近波利亞對軸心國宣戰，視為前任總統卡斯蒂洛訪問美國之結果。革命政府領袖維拉賽爾少校已任新練統，玻利維亞首都昨日甚為活動，民衆聞政府已被推翻，均聚集於政府公署前，議員伊斯頓索羅向舉衆發表演說，申言國民黨將保障國家之自由，改良社會之現况，民衆對新政府之批評必須依據事實，羣衆旋即散去。近郊曾發生衝突，參加新政府之空軍派飛機盤旋於首都上空，藉以彈壓反對者，衆信觀於政變之迅速成功　有長時期之準備。</p>

<p>克森橋頭堡德軍撤退</p>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　德軍當局二十日發表：德軍業自聶伯河下游之克森橋頭堡撤退。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：東綫冬季大，現已展開，因過去數日凍結地面，可使德蘇雙方之重裝部隊得以通行無阻，戰事除北部戰區外，已沿東綫全部發動，前日之猛烈戰事中心，現叉成為戰　之焦點。今年冬季戰事之性質，與一九四一至一九四二及一九四二至一九四三年兩次冬季戰事，略有不同，因現不僅為蘇軍一方面之攻勢，而德軍將不限於防守之作戰，必將利用現行時間，以作廣泛之軍事行動。在某處要點，德軍已恢復行動自由，此種對蘇軍之危險，又將迫使蘇方使用其移韓戰事焦點之戰略，此可以促蘇軍向尼柯波爾。尼維爾·及尼普貝特羅安斯克之南進攻即可證明，。德軍向齊托密爾及柯洛斯賴之東進攻，而自基　四而向其目的推進，旣在堅硬之地面，使重坦克車部隊得以展開。德軍在克森及契爾喀　之移動，敵人毫不發覺，德軍指揮部在此區之作戰目的，現仍未知，而德軍在基洛伏格勒區之反攻，實堪注意，　孟斯坦元帥之戰略能獲成功，蘇軍將陷於困境。蘇方對於冬季戰事，係寄予甚大之希望·使夏季及秋季所不能達到之目標，均於冬季完成之，故蘇軍之新攻勢顯圖突破，而其已從事更　愼之準備矣。德軍採取彈性戰略，已能克服甚多困難，故現可推想，此種戰術將予蘇軍以　大之消耗，蘇軍在尼維爾甫面之突進，現已成　着狀態，而德軍在該城北之反壓力則繼續增加。從經　之表示，大規模之攻勢除於第一次攻勢即獲大量之進展外，否則雖有局部之成功，亦將趨於定着之狀態，德軍界方面均以為在尼維爾區之戰事，現尙未逮到共頂點。</p>

<h3 id="c23">華北開發公司　華中振興公司的將來（一） <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>中日盟約與</p>
<p>兩公司將來</p>
<p>中日同盟條約以互惠平等為原則，規定兩國協力大東亞建設並確保安定。於是民國二十九年十一月簽訂的舊中日基本條約中所規定的駐兵權，及華北蒙疆·揚子江下流地域的經濟的特殊性，均吿拂除。舊條約第六條中有此一條：「兩國密切協力開發華北，　疆之特定資源，對於增進在揚子江下流地域之通商交易，及華北，蒙疆間物資供求之合理化，尤應密切合作。」新同盟條約中無此規定，唯第三條「爾國應以互惠為基調，實行緊密之經濟提携。」</p>
<p>如實澈這新條約的　旨，則對華北開發及華中振興二國策公司的不加以相當　　。在中國事變初期，民國二十七年十一月設立的兩公司，排除我資本之無統制的向大陸進出，以實行　中華北產業之合理的開發，復興為目的。對交通·運輸·港灣·通信·電氣·瓦斯等的公共事業，鑛產·　，水產等重要事業投資，融資，或担任經營，迄今日，成績相當可　。然而此事　業係所謂中國的健錀產業，故如欲　產新條約的趣旨，確立中國之自主獨立態勢，當然應移體於中國方面自立經管。此時兩社所負担的任務，將在於補足中國方面不足的資本，技術的援助，及中日經濟合作的指導。然此種事態之出現，須全面和平實現，戰爭狀態終了時，始有可能，故亦可視為將來的問題。</p>
<p>當前的進路</p>
<p>上　根本的變革，雖是將來的問題，唯走向這階段之　進的步武，業已開始，新條約的交換公文中也有「雖在戰爭狀態繼續中，應按照情形許可，逐次由兩國間協議，準據本條約之旨趣，加以根本的調整」，依一月九日中國參戰以來所展開的對華新政策。現在正在實行中。</p>
<p>華北開發，華中振興兩公司業已着手調整所屬會社。華中振與關、係的調整方針，決定於本年三月，而華中　絲，華中　業兩公司為其第一次實施調整之公司。在華北，因與華中情形稍異，故其所屬公司調整之具體化，尙未有所聞。僅隨着舊敵產的移管，本　開發公司受託管理的中　，大汝口，山西，磁縣，焦作，柳泉各煤礦改為中日合辦的形式</p>
<p>收益减</p>
<p>投資增</p>
<p>此種所　公司之調整，今後仍將繼續進行。這自然直接減少總公司的收益。譬如在華中振興的場合，華中　絲的紅利八分，華中　業一成。兩公司均為所屬公司中成續頗好的，所以從振興公司的收益方面看來，不能不說是相當的機牲。</p>
<p>因此種所屬公司之調整，不僅收益减少。大家知道，華中華北物價　貴均甚猛烈，工資及其他諸經費目然亦趨增加，因此，各公司情形均頗困難，去年度華中的內河　船從一成减至八分，淮　煤礦從七分滅至六分，都為了經費增加。今後此種收益低落的情勢勢必仍然繼續增加。今後此種收益兩公司不能不挺身於新規車業的　設，以實獻於增强戰力。華北向襲鐵，輕金屬，華北的化　工業等、目前正在建設中。此等新則事業，須有巨額投資或放款，而其投資並不立即產生收益。建設期間，資本必定在睡眠狀態中，不能生和，縱令開始活動了，但在把製品供給內地時、不能不用低廉的價格，當然，在那塲合，將交付調整金、　究能抵過高昻的建設費和成　嗎？</p>
<p>在此種困難情形下，兩公司均向國策邁進，華中振興的新總裁高島菊次　氏就任時會說：「把振興公司的收益以供犧牲，挺身於國策，」國策公司的眞面目，實在此處。</p>
<p>加强營</p>
<p>團性格</p>
<p>華北開發的本年度事業資金據說須四億二千三百萬圓，華中振興六千三百萬圓。　措此種資金，用發行債券的方針。劵集民股亦在考慮之中，但為額　小，且其股東多為出征者及及遺族家族，而收益的不可靠又如前述，因此種種理由，不能實現。是以專賴發行　　以　措資金的結果，將到達已級資本五倍的債劵發行限度。因而這限度即將擴充。</p>
<p>這樣　指資金，殆不能依賴股份方式的資金。加以對於股份的紅利，如洞察今後的情勢，必不獨力而行。第八十一屆議會中，政府已決定延長補給期限。兩公司自創辦時起的五年間，即　本年末為止。對民問股份中以六分的紅利，從政府收　補給金。但為　將來計，更延長五年。（翔：　自東洋經濟新報第二零九九號）</p>

<h3 id="c34">米 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>昨天我們申請目前的糧食問題，主張取締定私消滅黑市，並以忠實的客觀的態度，為統制米糧的米統會檢討責任。今天米統會負責人發表談話，說明配給責任在糧食調整委員會，運輸責任在華中米穀配給組合，米統會則貴化採買，正積極進行。我們對此問題，無意於斤斤巧辯，但在人民立場，不得不再申所見：</p>
<p>米糧統制委員會在組織上，在客觀的需要上，在統制的意義，上絕對不僅負資採辦，同時負責運輸與配給。我們主張機構簡單，辦事敏捷，廢除駢枝，集中事權。</p>
<p>最近四個月中，戶口米祗有八期八升。最近黑市米價高至×××××。都是事實。因此，人民對於管理機構之間的彼此解釋，認為都是無稗信用的詞費。人民需要的是事實的改善。</p>
<p>給目的，原在維護生產者輿消費者之間的共同利益，盡量減少中間剝削。上海市區完全是消費者，現在購米一石須付××××××，而產米區的生產者僅得八百餘元，其間差額愈大，中飽者愈肆無忌憚，而上海市民與產米區農民則愈受剝削，以致影響生產藝縮。所以，我們主張機構簡單與人事廉潔，竭力減少中間之剝削，米統會旣為惟一的統制米糧機構，即應負起整個責任。</p>
<p>最後，我們希望身受痛苦的市民，對於民食問題，貢獻具體意見，對於中間剝削者，揭發罪惡。　集硏究，提供當局。我們要求改善民食，進而抑平物價。</p>

<h3 id="c35">配給生活必需品 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>昨論調查生活必需品，茲言配給生活必需品，因為調查之目標，固在於如何圓滑配給，可是，配給的成效，又不僅在於調査完成以後，而是在於調查完成以後對於生活必需品配給後　的聲飭，所以要論配給生活必需品。</p>
<p>記給是統制工作的表現，同時，也是貨幣與商品交換的表現，對於大衆生活問題，關係　切。倘然配給品不能為笑滿的表現，其一般的結果，一定是人人對於配給前途，表示滿腔的失望，同時，一切生活必需品的黑市，非但永無消滅之一日，抑且要變本加厲，使人民在生活上所遭受的痛苦與威脅，愈趨嚴重了。</p>
<p>在許許多多必要條件之中，我們感覺配給機構裏面的一個基層條件，便是販賣生活必需品之零售商，應當依其販賣業的種別，如織維製品，食料品，燃料，其他家庭日用雜貨等，在配給統制當局的指導與監督之下，組織單一商業組合或公會，同時，儘量利用現行保甲制度，作為消費者團體之代表，然後再由商業組合與消費者團體在緊密聯絡之下，對各個地區之消費者負責進行配給事宜。至於販賣性質的公會，須以共同批進，保管，搬運，為其任務，而以協助政府調整消費，抑平物價為其鵠的；若仍以營利為前提的話，那未，配給機構的基層，便要首先腐化了，還談得什麽配給事業之完成？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Lessons Learned from the Sinking of the Huatai Steamer <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The sinking of the Huatai steamer has turned into a major tragedy in the transportation sector, which is heartbreaking. The aftermath and liability issues are currently under investigation and review in various aspects, and it is hoped that strict and comprehensive measures will soon be formulated and implemented. Although the dead cannot be brought back to life, the inner pain we suffer from this tragedy will never be healed. However, tragedy must be the result of debauchery and laziness. If we can learn lessons from the tragedy, cultivate perseverance, eradicate the real root causes of this tragedy, and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, or even pursue truth and reason from the tragedy, draw inferences about other cases, and expand the effectiveness of what we have learned, so that we know how to plan for the future in various situations, then even though the dead may harbor boundless regrets, they will still have made some contribution after all, and even though the living may suffer great pain, they will still be somewhat comforted. Otherwise, tragedies will continue to emerge and become more and more tragic, and eventually we will share the fate of the passengers on the Huatai steamer, sooner or later suffering the disaster of drowning. Although the forms may vary, their sorrow will be the same.</p>
<p>The function of transportation must meet certain conditions (see the editorial in this newspaper on the 2nd of this month) before it can be fully utilized, and safety must be the top priority for passenger transport. In addition to docks or temporary piers at larger locations, inland river steamers in China often make do with whatever is available, directly using sampans for passengers to embark and disembark, and sometimes in the dark of night, everything is shrouded in obscurity. Even if the crew and passengers strictly abide by the rules, it is already extremely dangerous, especially for women, the elderly, and the weak. The situation in Xingan is also the same, so improvements in equipment should be paid attention to in the future to ensure safety.</p>
<p>All regulations must be strictly enforced. If temporary accommodations are sought, or to facilitate the fulfillment of private desires, resulting in the executors and supervisors regarding the regulations as mere formalities, it will inevitably lead to tragedy. For example, the passenger limit of the Huatai steamer was 538 people, but in fact it exceeded that by more than double, which is simply absurd. Therefore, we should promote the spirit of abiding by the law to seek rectification, and this is not limited to the transportation sector!</p>
<p>According to the surviving passengers, the crew demanded tips from the passengers and piled goods on the deck like a mountain, making the ship prone to tilting. Once it tilted, it was impossible to maintain balance, which led to the disaster. At that time, the crew took advantage of their position to exploit the passengers, and they were complacent and full of self-satisfaction. When they negotiated and extorted, their faces were ferocious, like tigers preying on lambs, leaving no room for mercy or pretense. The company also happily pretended to be deaf and dumb, and took advantage of their ability to extort on the spot without considering improving the crew's treatment. The crew's disregard for the law was caused by the company's indirect indulgence. Now that the ship has sunk, the company has lost its operating tool, and many of the crew members who died with the passengers must also be buried in the bellies of the fish. If the dead could know, the crew's regret may be even greater than that of the passengers. In the same boat in the middle of the river, sharing life and death, why put people in a place where they cannot breathe, until they perish together. There are many fools like these crew members today, but it is a pity that they have not realized their mistake until the "water enters the side door", and they still insist on their perverse behavior. It will be too late to regret it when they "sink to the bottom". We really have no time to mourn for the passengers and mourn for the crew, or even have no time to mourn for the crew and mourn for ourselves. All those who are in a group with common interests should reflect on themselves, and hopefully not use the strong to bully the weak, and restrain their behavior a little. This is the biggest lesson that should be learned from the sinking of the Huatai steamer.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Second Anniversary of Japan-Thailand Alliance Celebrated Yesterday, Both Countries Determined to Strive for Liberation with All Their Might <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Bangkok, 21st (Central News Agency) - The new Thai government held a commemorative ceremony at 10:00 AM this morning to mark the second anniversary of the Japan-Thailand alliance. Japanese officials were also invited. Prime Minister Pibulsonggram, Defense Minister Prayoon Phamonmontri and all cabinet ministers, political and military leaders, Japanese Ambassador Teiji Tsubokami, Commander Shiba, Army Attaché Yamada, Ogura, etc. attended. Prime Minister Pibul gave a speech expressing his determination, followed by Ambassador Tsubokami's reply. Then they all went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to raise a glass in celebration. Because today is also the first anniversary of the ratification and exchange of the Japan-Thailand Cultural Agreement, the Thai side held a celebratory tea party at the National Academy of Arts at 4:00 PM, and a celebration party for the second anniversary of the alliance at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 21st (Central News Agency) - The main points of Prime Minister Pibulsonggram's speech and Japanese Ambassador Tsubokami's reply at the ceremony commemorating the second anniversary of the Thailand-Japan alliance are as follows:</p>
<p>Thai Prime Minister's Speech</p>
<p>Thailand clearly recognizes that the Empire of Japan is aiming to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere based on mutual respect for freedom and independence, and has the lofty spirit of thoroughly eliminating evil labor. Therefore, at the beginning of the war, it resolutely rose up and vowed to live and die with Japan. In the past, Thailand, like other Asian countries, had constantly resisted the oppression of imperialism, and therefore deeply knows its hardships. The Thai people also understand that all Asian nations hope to realize friendship in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, two years ago, they signed this alliance treaty with Japan. Since then, the two countries have fully cooperated in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects. At the same time, other East Asian countries are also cooperating with Japan with all their strength. I believe that our cooperation will surely achieve the final result.</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador's Reply</p>
<p>In the first year of the Japan-Thailand alliance, we achieved unprecedented great war results. In the second year, we also achieved great results comparable to the first year. At the same time, the enemy's attempts to launch a general counterattack in East Asia have been frustrated everywhere, further promoting the construction of our Co-Prosperity Sphere and the preparation for long-term offense and defense. Moreover, the enemy camp is increasingly suspicious of each other after being defeated, and its internal conflicts are deepening. On the contrary, the fighting spirit and unity of our camp are becoming more and more vigorous and strengthened. The war situation in the past two years is completely consistent with the long-term fixed combat plan. These facts make us more convinced of victory. Japan is pleased to recognize Thailand's merger of the four Malay states and the entire Shan states. Thailand shares the war front with Japan, either through economic cooperation or by providing bases to Japan. In the past, Japan and Thailand's desire to liberate Greater East Asia has been gradually realized through two years of hard struggle. Today, East Asian allies are expressing their feelings and have reached a consensus on the exemplary role of the Japan-Thailand alliance in East Asia. They have joined alliances with Japan, which led to the holding of the Greater East Asia Conference and the publication of the Five Great Principles. Here, I, Ambassador Tsubokami, and Prime Minister Pibul solemnly declare on behalf of the people of Japan and Thailand that we will devote all our efforts to the struggle for the survival and liberation of Greater East Asia in the future battles.</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister's Congratulatory Message</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and Greater East Asia Minister Aoki jointly hosted a luncheon party to commemorate the Japan-Thailand alliance at the Foreign Minister's residence on the 21st. In addition to Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and Greater East Asia Minister Aoki, participants included Thai Ambassador to Japan, Hada Young, Thai military attachés from the army, navy, and air force, Japanese Director General of the Information Bureau Amau, Navy Minister Shimada, Chief of the General Staff Sugiyama, Chief of Naval Operations Nagano, and many others. During the luncheon, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and Ambassador Hada Young gave congratulatory speeches respectively, expressing the determination of Japan and Thailand to complete the Greater East Asia War. The main points of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's speech are as follows: Japan's fundamental policy is to maintain friendly relations with East Asian countries. Therefore, following the Japan-Thailand alliance treaty, there are also the Japan-Burma, Japan-Philippines treaties, and the China-Japan alliance treaty, which mutually respect the sovereignty and independence of each other and cooperate to build Greater East Asia. This friendly relationship between neighboring countries has been actively promoted and has formed the foundation for world peace. The previously published Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has already stated this. Japan and Thailand are both located in East Asia. The failure to maintain naturally friendly relations in the past was due to the invasion of a third party. Today, Asia has awakened. No matter how the enemy implements strategies, propaganda, and tactics of intimidation and separation, it will be useless. Recently, the enemy has revealed its plight due to the failure of its counterattack. The Japanese army is capable of crushing any enemy attack. The ambitions of Britain and the United States lie in extracting and invading East Asia and controlling the new world. Our war aims, on the other hand, are to defend our homeland and contribute to the advancement of the world. We are confident that our just cause will be achieved through our determination and strength.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Japanese Greater East Asia Minister and Thai Foreign Minister Exchange Broadcasts Yesterday <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Japanese Greater East Asia Minister Aoki exchanged broadcasts with Thai Foreign Minister Direk on the 21st. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Greater East Asia Minister Aoki</p>
<p>The broadcast stated: In November of this year, representatives from various countries in Greater East Asia gathered in Tokyo to hold the Greater East Asia Conference. The conference stated that the cause of this war was the attempt by Britain and the United States to control East Asia. In order to complete the war, all countries expressed their determination to cooperate with each other. Although Britain and the United States have repeatedly suffered defeats in this war, they continue to counterattack, but they have been crushed by the Japanese army. The momentum of Japan's inevitable victory has become more consolidated. Since the beginning of the war, Britain and the United States have suffered a loss of 400,000 in manpower, and in terms of materials, they have lost a total of 2,200 ships and about 11,000 aircraft. The number is extremely large. The British and American rulers have even forbidden the public holding of funerals for the war dead and do not allow the families of the dead to wear mourning clothes. It is the good British and American rulers who know that in this war against Japan, both personnel and materials have suffered severe losses. In order to cover up their mistakes, they sell special deceptive tricks to the people. Now that they are discussing the purpose of the war in their own countries, it is natural. Therefore, they are now extremely anxious and eager to launch a large-scale counterattack, but Japan has already anticipated this and has sufficient countermeasures. Especially after next year, the enemy's expansion of productivity will be limited. On the contrary, Japan's productivity and combat power will be enhanced due to the strengthening of the domestic decisive battle system. Japan's strategic position will also become more consolidated. At that time, we will have full confidence in completely sealing off and thwarting the enemy's counterattack attempts. Therefore, the enemy, Britain and the United States, are gradually losing confidence in the future of the war, and recently they have been actively implementing strategic propaganda. However, the unity of the Greater East Asian nations based on morality and faith is extremely consolidated and will never be influenced by the self-interest propaganda of Britain and the United States. This goes without saying.</p>
<p>Thai Foreign Minister Direk</p>
<p>The broadcast stated: On the anniversary two years ago, we stood with the Japanese people on a common destiny, striving to liberate the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia and build the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, the Thai government and the Thai people have made all kinds of sacrifices, and the Thai army has since stood on the same line with the Japanese army. In economic and cultural aspects, we have also concentrated all our efforts to cooperate with Japan in order to implement the war. In addition, the joint declaration passed by the Greater East Asia Conference is the most important political, diplomatic, and cultural event in the history of the world, because the various countries of Greater East Asia are united in accordance with the principles of mutual respect for independence, respect for cultural customs, and economic mutual assistance, so that the entire Asian compatriots have more and more consolidated the belief in the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the inevitable victory of the war. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Pibul, the entire Thai nation is fighting on the common front with our ally Japan, and we are confident that we will achieve the final victory. At the same time, today is also the anniversary of the ratification of the Japan-Thailand Cultural Agreement. It can be said that the Cultural Agreement is a milestone in the friendly relations between the two countries, paving the way for the future glory and happiness of the two countries.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Sudden Revolution in Bolivia, New Government Declares Establishment, Villarroel Elected Provisional President <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report, a coup d'état has suddenly occurred in Bolivia. President Castillo has been overthrown. An officer commanding five soldiers arrested the president and several of his relatives the day before yesterday. The coup d'état was launched by the "National Revolutionary Movement" and army officers, led by Tapaga Easton Solo and others. Civil aviation has been cut off, and two cabinet members have also been arrested.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since the strike of tin miners in Bolivia, some people in the country have become increasingly dissatisfied with President Castillo's anti-Axis policies. Therefore, at dawn on the 20th, the National Revolutionary Party led by Easton Solo revolted and surrounded and occupied the presidential residence and other locations within four hours. At 7:00 PM, they declared on the radio that "the revolution has been victorious" and placed President Castillo, Defense Minister, and Chief of Staff under house arrest. It is reported that Easton Solo and others have formed a new government, but the city of La Paz is still under martial law. Troops are stationed in all newspapers to prevent publication. President Castillo is 51 years old. During the Bolivia-Paraguay War, he served as Chief of Staff of the Bolivian Army. Later, he was elected president with the support of the Bolivian Army. Because he is pro-American, he is very anti-National Socialist and advocates war against the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Madrid, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from La Paz, the new government of Bolivia has been organized by the revolutionary party headed by Major Villarroel.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report from La Paz: After fierce debates in government offices for several hours, the Bolivian rebels elected Major Villarroel as the provisional president of Bolivia. National Party member Easton Solo was appointed Minister of Finance. He is one of the leaders of the National Revolutionary Movement that launched the coup. The new government issued a statement to the public, stating that the revolution was completely successful, and the old regime that oppressed the people has been overthrown. The establishment of the new government is purely out of patriotism and for the benefit of the people. It will start with the economic liberation of the country, and the Atlantic Charter and Bolivia's international obligations will be respected. Foreign policy will not be changed. Former President Castillo issued a statement yesterday, stating that he had resigned in accordance with the wishes of the people and the army. The rebels occupied government offices the night before and arrested Castillo, Defense Minister General Conde, Interior Minister Cervetti, and Chief of Staff, etc. They were all detained in private residences. Two brothers of former President Castillo who had just returned from the United States were also arrested. Due to the prohibition of the revolutionary government, no newspapers were published yesterday. The National Party expressed dissatisfaction with Bolivia's policy of relying on the United States. The government's measures to suppress the general strike in the Catavi mining area were considered only beneficial to the United States. The National Party and army officers also opposed Bolivia's recent declaration of war on the Axis powers, which they considered the result of former President Castillo's visit to the United States. Major Villarroel, the leader of the revolutionary government, has taken office as the new president. The capital of Bolivia was very active yesterday. When the people heard that the government had been overthrown, they gathered in front of the government offices. Member of Parliament Easton Solo gave a speech to the crowd, stating that the National Party will guarantee the freedom of the country and improve the current social conditions. The people must base their criticisms of the new government on facts. The crowd then dispersed. Conflicts occurred in the suburbs. The air force, which participated in the new government, sent airplanes to circle over the capital to suppress opponents. It is believed that the rapid success of the coup was due to long-term preparations.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Background and Causes of the Bolivian Revolution <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to German News Agency: Easton Solo, leader of the Bolivian Nationalist Movement and Minister of Finance of the new government, recently delivered a radio address, explaining the purpose of the revolution in the country. It is said that after former President Castillo stepped down, Bolivia has passed the shameful era, the deceptive policies of the ruling class have become a thing of the past, and the expenses of wandering abroad can also be saved. Bolivia will no longer belong to the Castillo family. Solo continued that the most offensive thing was Castillo's recent order to protect national security, the purpose of which was nothing more than to extend the ruling class for another four years. Under these circumstances, something had to be done. The National Youth Officers' Movement decided to fight against the capitalist entrepreneurs and conspirators. We rely on the assistance of the people, and our actions are motivated by patriotism.</p>
<h3 id="e10">United States Had No Prior Knowledge <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to German News Agency: According to a Washington report, the United States had no prior knowledge of the overthrow of the Bolivian government.

<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Vice Minister of Finance recently issued a statement, explaining the key points of the tax increase plan as follows: In view of the current stage of the war, the government intends to increase national revenue in order to meet the increase in war expenses, consolidate the foundation of wartime property, decorate frugal consumption, and absorb purchasing power, and decided to implement tax increases in the next year. Although this tax increase is centered on direct taxes such as income tax, considering the purpose of the tax increase, we also decided to increase other indirect taxes to a considerable extent. Therefore, the scope of the tax increase is quite broad. The amount of the tax increase is estimated to be about 2.2 billion yuan in the first year and about 2.5 billion yuan in the ordinary year.</p>

The new anthem will be played for the first time on March 15, 1944. It is claimed that the reason for changing the anthem is that the old anthem does not reflect the various changed situations after the Soviet Union's future victory.</p>

<p>German Troops Retreat from Kherson Bridgehead</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) — The German authorities announced on the 20th: German troops have withdrawn from the Kherson bridgehead in the lower Dnieper River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) — The German News Agency reported: The winter war on the Eastern Front has now begun. Due to the frozen ground in the past few days, both German and Soviet heavy troops can pass unimpeded. The war has been launched along the entire Eastern Front, except for the northern war zone. The center of the fierce fighting the day before yesterday has now become the focus of the battle. The nature of this year's winter war is slightly different from the two winter wars from 1941 to 1942 and 1942 to 1943. This is because it is not only an offensive by the Soviet army, but the German army will not be limited to defensive operations. They will use the current time to conduct extensive military operations. At a certain key point, the German army has regained freedom of action. This danger to the Soviet army will force the Soviet side to use its strategy of shifting the focus of the war. This can be proved by the Soviet army's southward offensive towards Nikopol, Nevel, and Dnepropetrovsk. The German army's eastward offensive towards Zhitomir and Korosten, and the advance from Kiev towards its target, is possible because the hard ground allows heavy tank units to deploy. The enemy did not notice the German army's movements in Kherson and Cherkasy. The German command's operational objectives in this area are still unknown. The German army's counteroffensive in the Kirovograd area is noteworthy. If Marshal von Manstein's strategy is successful, the Soviet army will be in trouble. The Soviet side places great hopes on the winter war, hoping to achieve goals that could not be achieved in the summer and autumn. Therefore, the Soviet army's new offensive clearly aims to break through, and it has engaged in more cautious preparations. The German army has overcome many difficulties by adopting a flexible strategy. Therefore, it can be inferred that this tactic will cause great attrition to the Soviet army. The Soviet army's advance on the Nevel front has now become stagnant, while the German army's counter-pressure north of the city continues to increase. Experience shows that large-scale offensives, unless they achieve significant progress in the first offensive, will tend to stagnate even with partial success. The German side believes that the fighting in the Nevel area has not yet reached its peak.</p>

<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) — The German News Agency learned from military sources: German aircraft attacked military and industrial targets in the London area with heavy bombs on Sunday night and Monday morning. Although British anti-aircraft artillery put up a strong defense, the German aircraft's operations were very smooth and the intended targets were effectively bombed. On their return flight, the German aircraft saw large fires and smoke billowing in many places, indicating severe damage. Only one German aircraft did not return to base.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) — The German News Agency reported: On the night of the 20th, many British terrorist bombers attacked residential areas in several locations in southwestern Germany, dropping explosive and incendiary bombs, causing significant losses and casualties among the civilian population. German air defenses, taking advantage of favorable weather conditions, engaged the British aircraft in fierce fighting. The final report on the number of enemy aircraft has not yet been received. Another report stated that London official broadcasts acknowledged that twenty-five British Flying Fortress and Liberator aircraft were missing from yesterday afternoon's operation against northwestern Germany. Also, a large formation of powerful American bombers invaded the German Bight yesterday, encountering concentrated German artillery fire. High-flying enemy four-engine bombers rushed into the anti-aircraft fire line, and many German fighters broke through the enemy fighter escort and attacked the enemy bombers very successfully. As far as is known, thirty four-engine enemy bombers have been shot down, and the enemy has lost more than 300 airmen. Eleven German fighter pilots and their aircraft did not return to base.</p>

<h3 id="e23">The Future of the North China Development Company and the Central China Promotion Company (1) <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Sino-Japanese Alliance and</p>
<p>The Future of the Two Companies</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty stipulates that the two countries cooperate in the construction of Greater East Asia and ensure stability on the principle of mutual benefit and equality. As a result, the right to station troops stipulated in the old Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty signed in November of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), and the economic specificity of North China, Mengjiang, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, were all eliminated. Article 6 of the old treaty contained this clause: "The two countries shall cooperate closely in the development of North China and Mengjiang's specific resources, and shall cooperate closely in promoting trade and commerce in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and rationalizing the supply and demand of materials between North China and Mengjiang." There is no such provision in the new alliance treaty, only Article 3: "Your country shall implement close economic cooperation based on mutual benefit."</p>
<p>If the purpose of this new treaty is thoroughly implemented, the two national policy companies, North China Development and Central China Promotion, should be given considerable consideration. The two companies, established in November of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) in the early stages of the China Incident, aimed to prevent the uncontrolled advance of our capital into the mainland and to implement the rational development and reconstruction of North China's industry. They have invested, financed, or managed important businesses such as public utilities of transportation, transportation, ports, communications, electricity, and gas, mineral production, and fisheries, and their achievements to date are quite commendable. However, this business system is the so-called "key industry" of China. Therefore, if one wants to implement the purpose of the new treaty and establish China's independent and autonomous posture, it should naturally be transferred to the Chinese side for independent management. At this time, the tasks borne by the two companies will be to supplement the insufficient capital on the Chinese side, provide technical assistance, and guide Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. However, the emergence of this situation is only possible when full peace is realized and the state of war ends, so it can also be regarded as a future problem.</p>
<p>Current Path</p>
<p>Although the above fundamental changes are a future problem, the progressive steps towards this stage have already begun. The exchange of notes in the new treaty also stated that "Although the state of war continues, fundamental adjustments should be made gradually by agreement between the two countries in accordance with the spirit of this treaty, as circumstances permit." This is in accordance with the new policy towards China that has been unfolding since China's participation in the war on January 9. It is currently being implemented.</p>
<p>The North China Development and Central China Promotion companies have already begun to adjust their affiliated companies. The adjustment policy for Central China Promotion was decided in March of this year, and Central China Silk and Central China Industry are the first companies to implement the adjustment. In North China, the situation is slightly different from that in Central China, so the concretization of the adjustment of its affiliated companies has not yet been heard. Only with the transfer of old enemy property, the Zhongyuan, Dairukou, Shanxi, Cixian, Jiaozuo, and Liuquan coal mines managed by the North China Development Company under commission have been changed to Sino-Japanese joint ventures.</p>
<p>Reduced Revenue</p>
<p>Increased Investment</p>
<p>This kind of adjustment of affiliated companies will continue to be carried out in the future. This will naturally directly reduce the revenue of the parent company. For example, in the case of Central China Promotion, Central China Silk has a dividend of 8% and Central China Industry has a dividend of 10%. Both companies have quite good results among the affiliated companies, so from the perspective of the promotion company's revenue, it cannot be said to be a considerable sacrifice.</p>
<p>Due to this adjustment of affiliated companies, not only is revenue reduced. As everyone knows, price increases in North China and Central China are very fierce, and wages and other expenses naturally tend to increase. Therefore, the situation of each company is quite difficult. Last year, the internal river transport of Central China was reduced from 10% to 8%, and the Huainan coal mine was reduced from 7% to 6%, all due to increased expenses. In the future, this situation of declining revenue is bound to continue to increase. In the future, these two companies will have to stand up for the establishment of new businesses to contribute to strengthening combat power. In North China, new industries such as the Xijin iron, light metals, and the chemical industry are currently under construction. These new industries require huge investments or loans, and their investments do not immediately generate revenue. During the construction period, capital must be in a dormant state and cannot generate revenue. Even if they start operations, they cannot but supply products to the mainland at low prices. Of course, in that case, adjustment funds will be paid. Can it ultimately offset the high construction costs and achievements?</p>
<p>In this difficult situation, both companies are moving towards national policy. When the new president of Central China Promotion, Kikuji Takashima, took office, he said: "Sacrifice the revenue of the promotion company to stand up for national policy." The true face of the national policy company is here.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Business</p>
<p>Group Character</p>
<p>It is said that the business funds for North China Development this year are 423 million yuan, and 63 million yuan for Central China Promotion. To raise these funds, the policy of issuing bonds is used. Collecting private shares is also being considered, but the amount is small, and most of the shareholders are soldiers on expedition and their families, and the unreliability of revenue is as mentioned above. Therefore, for various reasons, it cannot be realized. As a result of relying solely on issuing bonds to raise funds, it will reach the bond issuance limit of five times the existing capital. Therefore, this limit will be expanded.</p>
<p>Thus, it is virtually impossible to rely on share-based funds to raise funds. In addition, if the situation is foreseen, dividends on shares will certainly not be made independently. In the 81st Congress, the government has decided to extend the supply period. The two companies have had a five-year period since their establishment, that is, until the end of this year. For private shares, a 6% dividend is received from the government as a supply. But for the sake of the future, it will be extended for another five years.

<h3 id="e25">Grain Control Association Announces Rice Distribution Situation; Rice Adjustment Association Handles Distribution <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Recently, because the allocation period of household rice in this city has been delayed repeatedly, there has been much criticism from the outside. In order to understand the actual situation, the reporter specially visited the Rice Grain Control Committee yesterday. According to the person in charge of the association, the allocation of household rice in Shanghai was originally the responsibility of the association. However, with the establishment of the Shanghai Food Adjustment Committee, it was decided after consultation in early last month that the total amount of rice for household use in Shanghai each month would be allocated by the association to the Shanghai Grain Adjustment Committee, which would then be responsible for the distribution. As for transportation, it would also be entrusted by the association to the Central China Rice Grain Distribution Association. In addition, on the 10th of last month, the Rice Grain Adjustment Committee sent a letter to the association requesting the allocation of 1,688 tons (equivalent to 276,880 dan) of rice for the household use of Shanghai citizens in December. After overall planning, the association replied to the committee on the 25th of that month, allocating 159,119 dan, 2 dou, and 5 sheng before November 30, 84,564 dan, 7 dou, and 5 sheng before the 20th of this month, and 32,989 dan and 1 dou and 4 sheng of rice transferred from the former Rice Grain Joint Management Association, totaling 276,673 dan, 1 dou, and 4 sheng. Transportation passports have long been issued, and all have been allocated to the Central China Rice Grain Distribution Association for transportation to Shanghai and delivery to the Rice Grain Adjustment Association for distribution of household rice. In the future, the distribution of household rice in Shanghai will be handled in accordance with the above-mentioned methods. The association's responsibility is to purchase rice for the household use of Shanghai citizens. It will overcome all difficulties and do its best. At present, various purchasing areas are actively engaged in purchasing large quantities of rice. Including purchasing areas A, B, and C, no less than 1.4 million dan have been purchased.</p>

<p>Central News Agency: After the Japanese General Headquarters announced that the Japanese garrison troops on Tarawa and Makin Islands, including General Shibasaki and 4,500 soldiers and military dependents, had all loyally sacrificed their lives, Colonel Keizo Matsushima, head of the press department of the Japanese Fleet in China, issued a statement. The main idea is that Tarawa and Makin Islands, where General Shibasaki's garrison troops were martyred this time, are our forward outposts. The enemy paid a great sacrifice to recapture the two islands, and the mission of the garrison troops in that area has also been completed. Minister Matsushima first stated: From a strategic point of view, Makin and Tarawa Islands are forward outposts of our Marshall Islands and are not basic positions. Their main purpose is to search for enemy information and to restrain the enemy in that area. If the enemy attacks, they will rise up and destroy its power. In addition, they also undertake important tasks such as supplying Japanese troops operating in that area. From this point of view, the garrison troops on the two islands, who all loyally sacrificed their lives this time, have fully completed the mission of the forward outposts, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. At the same time, they learned about the enemy's strategic intentions and weapons, which gave us valuable information and made a great contribution to guiding future operations. We firmly believe that all the heroic spirits of the soldiers will also be satisfied in their hearts about this point. However, being on this frontline, hot, miasma-ridden, isolated island, suffering from hardship and poverty for a long time, until finally all were martyred, the hard work of General Shibasaki's garrison soldiers and military dependents is not difficult to imagine. When thinking of the heroic sacrifice of all the soldiers, we, as the people of the whole country, will continue to follow the heroic spirits of the martyrs and be more determined to avenge and repay the country.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Owners of Gambling, Opium, and Dance Halls Should Quickly Suspend Business Voluntarily: Speech by Mr. Zhang Yipeng at the Thrift Movement <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Since the teenagers in the capital launched the movement to eliminate opium, gambling, and dance halls, it has caused a sensation. Teenagers in Shanghai have also responded at the same time. The reporter believes that this movement is directly and indirectly related to the current emphasis on thrift by the government and the public. Therefore, he visited Mr. Zhang Yipeng, the president of the Shanghai Thrift Movement Association, and Mr. Zhang explained his personal opinions in detail. The main points are revealed as follows: Before the closing of the inaugural meeting of the association, it was proposed to ban opium and gambling. Telegrams were sent to the National Government and the municipal government urging immediate implementation. Although dance halls were not included in the same category, they were long regarded as a luxury, and they should be earnestly advised at any time and any place. Now that the youth groups have put the three things together, it is appropriate. The people of this association should take immediate action, gather strength, and strive to achieve the goal of complete elimination. However, my personal opinion is that it is better for the owners of opium and gambling halls and dance halls to voluntarily close their businesses than to have outsiders interfere and force them to do so. Why? In this extraordinary period of wartime system and scarcity of materials, every aspect of thrift is still feared to be insufficient. If the people cannot earnestly implement it, the national power will inevitably be used to strictly stipulate laws and promote them vigorously. The business owners will be forced to stop one day, and the losses will be unimaginable. This is the first reason. The social economy is increasingly depleted, and it is still difficult to obtain proper food and clothing. Therefore, it is also expected that the number of people who frequent opium, gambling, and dance halls will decrease to the point of extinction. The business owners will suffer the natural elimination, and it will be difficult to recover the capital losses. This is the second reason. Even more unfortunately, if they encounter ambitious young people with vigor and blood, who are indignant at the tragedy of harming the society and disregarding the national crisis, and have no choice but to take destructive actions, the business owners will feel even more compelled to regret it. This is the third reason. With these three dangers, it is better to announce the closure of the business immediately. The buildings and equipment can be reorganized into thrift canteens, thrift auditoriums, thrift schools, and other facilities in order, operating one business to gain both reputation and benefit. I think the perfect strategy is no more than this. I hope that each and every one will think about it carefully.</p>

<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3 id="e35">Rice <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, we addressed the current food problem, advocating for the elimination of private trading and black markets and, with a sincere and objective attitude, examining the responsibilities of the Rice Control Committee in regulating rice supplies. Today, the responsible party of the Rice Control Committee issued a statement clarifying that the responsibility for allocation lies with the Food Adjustment Committee, the responsibility for transportation lies with the Central China Rice Grain Allocation Association, and the Rice Control Committee is actively engaged in purchasing. Regarding this issue, we have no intention of engaging in petty arguments. However, from the people's perspective, we must reiterate our views:</p>
<p>The Rice Grain Control Committee, in terms of its organization, objective needs, and the meaning of control, is absolutely responsible not only for purchasing but also for transportation and allocation. We advocate for a simple structure, efficient operations, the elimination of unnecessary branches, and the centralization of authority.</p>
<p>In the past four months, household rice rations have been only eight periods of eight liters each. The recent black market price of rice has been as high as ×××××. These are facts. Therefore, the people consider the explanations between the management agencies to be untrustworthy and pointless. The people need real improvements.</p>
<p>The original purpose was to safeguard the common interests of producers and consumers and to minimize intermediate exploitation. The Shanghai urban area is entirely a consumer area. Currently, purchasing one stone of rice costs ××××××, while the producer in the rice-producing area only receives over eight hundred yuan. The greater the difference, the more unscrupulous the profiteers become, and the more Shanghai citizens and farmers in rice-producing areas are exploited, thereby affecting production. Therefore, we advocate for a simple structure and clean personnel to vigorously reduce intermediate exploitation. The Rice Control Committee, as the sole agency for controlling rice supplies, should assume full responsibility.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that citizens who are suffering will contribute concrete suggestions regarding the food problem and expose the crimes of those who exploit the middle ground. [We] collect [suggestions for] research and provide them to the authorities. We demand the improvement of the people's food supply and, consequently, the suppression of prices.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Rationing of Essential Goods <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, [we] discussed investigating essential goods, and today [we] discuss rationing essential goods, because the goal of the investigation is precisely to smoothly ration them. However, the effectiveness of rationing depends not only on the completion of the investigation but also on the subsequent [clarification] of the rationing of essential goods after the investigation is completed. Therefore, [we] must discuss rationing essential goods.</p>
<p>Rationing is a manifestation of control work, and at the same time, it is also a manifestation of the exchange of currency and goods, which is closely related to the public's livelihood. If the rationed goods cannot meet expectations, the general result will be universal disappointment with the prospect of rationing. At the same time, the black market for all essential goods will not only never be eliminated but will also intensify, making the suffering and threats faced by the people in their daily lives increasingly severe.</p>
<p>Among the many necessary conditions, we feel that a basic condition within the rationing mechanism is that retailers selling essential goods should, according to the type of their business, such as textiles, food, fuel, and other daily household sundries, organize single business associations or guilds under the guidance and supervision of the rationing authorities. At the same time, existing baojia systems should be utilized as representatives of consumer groups, and then the business associations and consumer groups should closely cooperate to be responsible for carrying out rationing matters for consumers in each area. As for guilds of a commercial nature, their task should be joint wholesale, storage, and transportation, and their goal should be to assist the government in adjusting consumption and suppressing prices. If profit is still the premise, then the foundation of the rationing mechanism will be the first to become corrupt. How can we talk about the completion of the rationing cause?</p>

<p>The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, considering that the names of accounting subjects used by financial institutions in the city are quite inconsistent, which hinders financial management policies and operational efficiency, convened a meeting yesterday (the 21st) at 2:00 PM.

<p>Silk Industry, Meiya and Allied Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks were quite tortuous, entirely due to the advance of yarn and cotton gangs, and the near approach of the lunar New Year, which caused the demand for cash households to surge. The trend in the textile industry was the most attractive, and the Chinese silk industry rose sharply. The Meiya Silk Factory also saw some demand and little supply in the afternoon. The Zhenfeng Cotton Weaving buying trend also ignited. Yong'an Yarn spun around and tended towards stability. In the department store industry, Yong'an was flat, while Guohuo and Xinxin both made progress. Among the new pharmaceutical industries, Zhongfa's initial [price] continued to rise, while Xinya lacked development. In the public utility industry, Beishui was at 345 yuan, and Huadian was at 240 yuan. Yongxing Real Estate once rose to 38 yuan in after-hours trading, making it the strongest.

<p>In the West Youth Basketball League, there are two Group B games starting at 6:15 PM tonight: Sea Whale vs. Shantou B and French Business vs. Baoqing. Following that, there will be two Group A games. First, Mounauk vs. Huanan. Mounauk is a local team in the West Youth League and has many advantages. As for Huanan, since its inception, it has been unfortunately defeated by the Oriental team, but it has won all four other games. In the West Youth Cup, its record is second only to Hua, and it can despise all other teams. The collaboration between Jin Guigui, Jiu Quan, and Liu Jiakun is unique. Although Mounauk is tricky, it is spared from signing a treaty of surrender with Huanan. Next is Sanlun vs. Huaying. Through hard work, Huaying's skills have improved rapidly, and its momentum is extremely strong. Since Sanlun's freedom, although all four games have been lost, the opponents have been strong. Tonight, they meet Huaying, and it is difficult to predict who will win. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Sea Whale vs. Shantou B (B1) 6:15 PM, French Business vs. Baoqing (B2) 7:10 PM, Mounauk vs. Huanan (A) 8:00 PM, Sanlun vs. Huaying (A) 9:00 PM. Yesterday's report time was 7:10 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e45">A Hospital on Luoyang Road Shanghai Nanyang Hospital Visit Notes <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Nanyang Hospital has always been able to do all clinical tests themselves. Let’s take a look at the testing questions. This place, full of academics, gives the participants the most interesting lesson. Recently, Dr. Wu Zhaoren, a famous Chinese bacteriologist, joined, expanding the original laboratory. For bacterial culture, all kinds of businesses are still among the best in China. Dr. Gu Kai said that they have recently started adding clinical laboratories to the wards so that general interns can more easily obtain the necessary medical insights. Although this is a huge burden for the hospital, on the left on the third floor, all are surgical groups, including a "large operating room", two "small operating rooms", one "labor room", one "delivery room", and a high-pressure steam sterilization room, a sterilized dressing room, a doctor's changing room and a bathroom, etc. All rooms are so-called "meat rooms" [surgical related areas] Unfortunately, there are troubles such as bathing and changing clothes. Otherwise, is it not extremely rare to visit the "surgery"? Taste However, just not entering the operating room is enough to make people's hearts beat. Look, the knives, saws, and pliers displayed inside are shining, which is especially interesting. To count as the "shadowless lamp" and short-wave coagulation machine, oxygen machine, etc., are more rare in ordinary hospitals. However, these are all scientific weapons to save people!</p>
<p>Strong Organization and Lineup</p>
<p>In "Chiba Hall", the history and achievements of Nanyang Hospital can be seen from the calligraphy and paintings of celebrities, and how it was praised by those who were saved. However, they are not complacent with past achievements, and are always paying attention to improvement, especially in the organization and physician lineup, never slightly involved in vagueness. Dr. Gu Kai said: Nanyang Hospital is purely a private sole proprietorship. There is no board of directors or other public or private social groups to assist. Since the 29th year of the Republic of China, in order to organize and strengthen the promotion force, the board of directors began to be planned, and Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Xu [missing character] Qun Pan Yangyao and other five courtyard directors were hired. The interior of the hospital is divided into three departments: medical, [missing word], and general affairs, to promote the medical business.</p>

<p>Youth (2)</p>
<p>"Oka, Mr. Tani..." Oka's mother, very kindly, led Zhenren into the living room. This is not the house where Longfu usually lives, but an eight-mat guest [room] facing the courtyard. In front of the [missing word] treasure table, Longfu's father was already waiting.</p>
<p>"Ah, congratulations..." With a [missing word] and a mustache, he looked very happy, talking to Zhenren and his own son. At the same time, Miss Zhizi, who had just turned eleven this year, tremblingly offered the dishes with her little hands. Staring, as if not very clever, but with a very cute face.</p>
<p>Soon, dinner began. Sashimi of cast fish, pork soup, stir-fried bamboo shoots, it looked delicious, but Zhenren didn't like chopsticks very much. This was the first time in his life that he had eaten with people he was not very familiar with in such a formal setting. His body and mind were restrained.</p>
<p>"So, I said I didn't like this." Although he wanted to prepare Longfu like this in his heart, he chatted with his parents and sister nonchalantly.</p>
<p>"Zhenren-kun, what are your aspirations after graduating from middle school?" Because Zhenren was silent, Longfu's father asked him this.</p>
<p>"Well, I haven't decided yet." Of course, he didn't want to talk about the inside story of his family.</p>
<p>"My brother [missing word], the Navy..." Zhizi cleverly added.</p>
<p>"The Navy is good, because he is [missing word] I hope he will be an official or a industrialist in the future..." At that time, there were still many mothers who said this kind of thing.</p>
<p>"No matter what my mother says, I have already decided on the Navy." Longfu argued with his mouth bulging. Zhenren was taken aback. Taking this attitude towards his mother was unimaginable in his family—</p>
<p>"Ah, good... If Longfu wants to join the Navy, he must strengthen his body. There is no national cadre as thin as that." The father laughed loudly. Thus, the [missing word] also restored a kind atmosphere.</p>
<p>After the meal, they ate waxberries. After-dinner fruit was rare for Zhenren. The luxurious living room, the oil table area, were all things that towns have. He really felt very free.</p>
<p>"Let's go to Tenpozan to play!" Longfu suggested this, which was a good opportunity.</p>
<p>"I bothered you." Zhenren, whose legs had become paralyzed, stood up straight and said goodbye.</p>
<p>"Brother, won't you take me?" Linzi followed behind the two of them.</p>
<p>"It's not a place girls can go:" Bathing in the warm spring sunshine, Longfu said in an adult-like tone.</p>

<p>The original telegram on the gambling and dancing movement, motivated by the enthusiasm of justice, is inspiring.
