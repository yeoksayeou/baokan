<h3 id="c1">實踐「總力參戰」的前提 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>參戰以後，國府對於一切設施，只有一個中心目標，就是集中全國的人力，物力和財力，以適應新的政治需要，實踐協力日本，保衛東亞的任務。爲了完成這一重大的任務，政府的國策，必須迅速地具體化和法制化，因爲國策的具體化和法制化，是集中國力的前提，也是實踐保衛東亞之戰的前提。倘使政府有了總動員的法令，明白規定了一般人民對於戰時國家應盡的義務是什麼。就是表示國家在積極方面，所要求於每一國民的是什麼，在消極方面，所要限制的是什麼，國民就可以明白參戰與國民的實際關係，旣不必因爲謠言而驚惶失措，也可以因法令而不怕無理的誅求，國民只要積極奉行法律，盡其慶盡的義務，政府就應予以保障與鼓勵。同時，在法律之前，沒有一個人可以例外，在法令之前，可以澈底肅淸因循泄沓的風氣，使社會成爲戰時的社會，使政治與經濟成爲戰時的政治與經濟，使一般國民生活成爲眞正的戰時國民生活。那才能眞正的實現國力的集中，才能實踐協力日本，保衛東亞，而然後可以期待最後的勝利。</p>
<p>集中國力的法令，或是嚴格的總動員法令，在於集中運用全部的人力物力，以加强協力大東亞戰爭的力量。所以在動員物資方面，應該包括所有兵器彈藥，軍用器材，糧秣被服，衛生醫藥，交通通信，運輸，土木，建築，燃料，電力等軍用物資，及其生產，修理，支配，供給及保存上所需要之原料與機器，都應該明定動員範圍。其次，在國力總動員業務方面，如生產，修理，支配，供給，輸出入，保管，試騐，研究，民生日用品之專賣，金融，運輸，通信，衛生，救護，救濟，情報，宣傳，敎育，訓練，徵購，徵發，土木建築，以至社會秩序之維持，市塲之監督，交通之保護，與防空及其他業務，都一應明定法令，實行動員民力以進行之。不僅必須動員國防有關的物資，至進而對一般原料及人民生活必需之統制；不但動員物資，且以業務爲對象，使國民爲最大的努力，適應現代總力戰之特徵，以補充保衛大東亞戰爭中大量的消耗，支持長期戰而期待最後的勝利。</p>
<p>集中國力的法令，必須包括人力，物力，財力，及文化各方面，作簡單明瞭的規定：（一）關於人力方面，對於勞動人員之使用，受僱，解僱，工資及其他勞動條件等，應由政府統顧全局而加以决定。對於勞資爭議，怠工等行爲，加以適當的處置，務使資方不得專計自身目前利潤，勞方亦不得出以怠工或罷工等行爲，以增進戰時生產，對於人材，實行普遍的調查登記，使一切方面的人材都能集中於國策的周圍以求其貫澈。不過人力的集中，全靠人民志願的協力，故必以政治官傳與與論動員爲第一義，非必要時，不能輕於運用法律的規定。（二）關於物力方面，其要義在於保障國防需要之隨時獲得滿足，同時必須兼顧國民最低限度物質生活的切實保障，因此，以積極的有計劃的發展生產增加物力爲第一義。而同時規定消極方面如何統制全國一切物力，舉凡有關物力的生產，運輸，販賣，使用，修理，儲藏，消費，遷移，或轉讓，都要明定管理與指導的原則和辦法，尤其是對於市塲交易的價格與數量，對於輸出輸入物資交換等，都要有明白的規定。至於民間物資之須由國家集中使用者，應以微購爲原則，非必要時決不實行徵發。關於總動員的工作，亦須鼓動人民樂於從事，以指導調整爲原則。（三）財力方面，自以管制金融，指導游資使適應國策，發展生產，增加戰時國力爲第一要義。對於貨幣之流通於滙兌的區域，人民債權的行使，債務之履行，銀行，公司，工廠等行號團體之設立，改組停閉，銀行，公司，工廠資金之運動，公債和股票市塲的範圍與價格，都須明白規定由政府管理或統制。尤其是關於資本運用之管制，可使向戰時產業必要部門發展，而防止浪費於不急需的生產事業中。而銀行，公司，工廠之盈益，若由政府限制，或賦課戰時利得稅，或再使投資於政府指定產業，更可防止戰時社會貧富過於懸殊之不安因素，而增加人民對政府的信心。</p>
<p>集中國力，動員全國人力，物力，財力，是參戰後的最大任務，但是這決不是幾句口號所能實現的。因此，關於總動員的法令，在今日是必需的。在總動員的實踐中，集中國力，作計劃性統一性的合理運用：對政治，經濟，社會，嚴密組織，切實調整，形成一個有機體的戰時體制，才能應付現代戰爭的長期性和爭取最後的勝利。</p>

<p>南京十二日中央社電　十三日下午五時、日駐華重光大使茶會招待出席全國經濟會議全體委員、屆時當有一番盛况、</p>
<p>周財長重要報告</p>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　財政部部長兼中央儲備銀行總裁周佛海氏、於今（十二）日全國經濟委員會、關於統一幣制管理金融、曾作詳細之報告、茲特將其結論中之重要一段、發表如下、</p>
<p>第一、上海有種奇離的謠言、說政府要另發一種通貨、這種謠言、只要稍有常識的人、就會知道是完全虛僞、決非事實、政府千辛萬苦、好容易纔使中儲券的流通普遍、使中儲券的基礎穩固、那裏會去新發一種通貨、把自己過去努力的成績、完全推翻呢、所以本人負責保證、政府決不會做這樣兒戲的事、</p>
<p>第二、有人說中儲券毫無發行準備、這也完全不是事實、根據中央儲備銀行法發行進備、是現金準備四成、保證準備六成、但是事實上我們現在所有的現金準備、在七成以上、保證準備不到三成、我們有着這樣充實的準備、難道說還不健全嗎、</p>
<p>第三、有人懷疑中儲券對日圓比率會要變更、這也是不必要的杞憂、不單是我政府要堅定現在的比率、就是友邦日本政府也充分協力維持這個比率、我們看靑木大臣在會議的答辯、就可知道、他說，「儲劵百元對日圓十八元、現在的交換比率、國民政府的方針、是無論如何要維持下去、我政府也完全同感、今後方針、也是要堅持這個比率、」中日兩國、都是這個方針、所以我也負責保證中儲劵對日圓的比率、是決不會變的、</p>
<p>第四、有人以爲中儲券發行太多、已有通貨膨脹之象、這也不是事實、通貨的供給超過市面上通貨需要的時候、纔算是通貨膨脹、現在中儲券的供給、是不是已超過了市面上的需要呢、絕對沒有、而且還是供不應需、我們看看市面上利息之高的情形、就可知道現在利息高的要到三分、這是甚麼原因呢、就是唯一法定通貨中儲劵的供給不够、中儲券的發行、還不能供給對於中儲券的需要、那裏可以說是通貨膨脹呢、不待說，去年一年之中、中儲券的發行額、有突飛猛進的增加、但是這有兩個原因、第一是流通區域由長江下游的三省兩市、擴張到武漢和華南、第二是舊幣的禁止流通、如果在限定的區域之內發行額這樣的增加、當然會有通貨膨脹的現象、但是中儲券的發行額、是隨着流通區域的擴大而增加的、換句話說、是隨着需要的增加供給的、所以不能引起通貨膨脹的現象、再看如果舊幣沒有禁止流通、而中儲券的發行這樣增加、市面驟然增加了這許多籌碼、也可引起通貨膨脹、但是舊幣是從市塲上絕跡了、中儲券不過是補充舊幣所留下的空隙、換句話說、就是中儲券不過取舊幣的地位而代之、市面上沒有增加籌碼、那裏會通貨膨脹、所以無論就理論說、或就事實看、决沒有通貨膨脹之象、</p>

<p>東京十二日中央社電　此間外交評論雜誌二月號社論、以國民政府之參戰爲題、對於國府之參戰評論甚詳、茲誌其大意如次、此次中華民國國民政府之參戰、乃中國四千餘年歷史上劃時代之偉舉、而爲創造大東亞新歷史之基礎、此在世界史上意義至爲重大、因此中日事變之性格、業與大東亞戰爭有不可分之關係、使渝方完全喪失抗戰意義、此次中日事變之戎首、並非僅爲蔣介石個人、眞正之敵人實爲英美、蓋事實上英美對於渝方極盡操縱支援之能事、以圖助長戰禍、消耗本實力、藉以遂其侵略東亞之野心、此等奸謀吾人於中日事變發生當時、即已明白指出、其猙獰面目茲已完全暴露矣、所幸汪精衛氏獨具卓識、洞悉英美奸謀、乃毅然糾合愛國同志、奔走和平、還都南京、並與日本締結中日基本關係約、共同努力建設東亞新秩序、因而獲得全國民衆之愛戴、遂奠定復興中國之基礎、至此日本於中日事變中膺懲渝方作戰之性格、亦發展而爲中日協力、以謀復興中國、保衛東亞、渝方已失繼續抗戰之意義、然而渝方仍執迷不悟、甘爲英美附庸、繼續無意義之抗戰、於大東亞戰爭勃發之際、復甘冒不諱、違反中國民衆之意、竟參加反軸心戰綫、妄圖妨碍大東亞解放聖戰之進展、彼雖以抗戰救國爲口號、實則甘作侵略東亞爲中日共同宿敵英美之前衛、此實與中國民衆擊滅英美之決意背道而馳、結果必自食其果、與英美同一命運而自趨崩潰、當國府參戰之際、中日兩國同時簽訂關於協力完遂戰爭之中日共同宣言、及交還租界及撤廢治外法權等之協定、日本交還在　中國之專管租界、承認中國儘速收回公共租界之行政權、並撤廢在華治外法權、凡此俱爲中國過去百年來在英美侵略下之最大國恥、及最不平等條約、孫中山先生實行國民革命之第一目標、亦即在此、日本當此次國府參戰之際、爲對華表示友好及信義起見、毅然與中國簽訂上述協定、中國地位因而提高國府實力因而增强、溯當去年十月英美爲實現利用渝方對日抗戰之謀略、而口頭聲明交還租界及撤廢治外法權、以欺騙中國、實則彼等所謂租界業已喪失、同時對中國仍拒絕予以平等待遇、企圖於戰後共同管理中國、由央美此種虛僞欺騙之態度而觀、更足以顯示日本此次對華態度之友好與公正、準此以觀、此次國府參戰、實爲復興中國之要件、而日本交還租界撤廢治外法權等、亦為中日基本關係條件必然之發展、而大東亞戰爭因國府之參戰、以其豐富之人力物力作全面協力、東亞各民族已完全立於同一戰綫、對於完遂戰爭、擊減英美實已操勝利左券、大東亞共存共榮之實現、已在目前云、</p>

<p>二月六日，日本眾議院戰時行　特國法案委員會　上，青木大東亞相闡釋中國通貨物資物價問題，已略誌二月十日本報第四版，茲以東京每日新聞所載，較為詳盡，　　譯如左。—編者註</p>
<p>衆議員戰時行政特例法案委員會，松本忠雄氏質問在增強生產力上極關重要的如中國的物質收買狀況，軍票對儲備券的兌換率，華中物價政策等問題。青木大東亞相答稱：軍票對儲備券的兌換率仍堅持不變，關於收買物資，擬儘量活用中國方面自參戰後愈趨旺盛協力與創意。至於中國方面，亦曾強調聲明增強生產力盡其可能以協助日本，由此，青木大東亞相說明了日本對華經濟財政政策的基本方針，以及物資動員計劃上，極為重要的中國方面的物資供出狀況，頗值得予以注意。要旨如次：</p>
<p>（一）華中的運貨工作　自去年三月國民政府廢止儲備券與舊法幣的等價政策，以求儲備券本身價值的安定後，當即決定了軍票十八圓對儲備券百元的兌換率堅持不變動。當收買必要物資時，使用何種通貨，為華中華南所急求解決的問題，於去年一年中，在華中國華南主要地區儲備券的統一工作已告完成，收買各種物資時，儲備券的使用已無障礙。日本方面，當然在可能範圍內，維持使用儲備券的方針。</p>
<p>（二）物資的收買狀況　其次，至於與中國民眾有直接關係的棉花，及其他農產品，極力要求中國方面的協助，並利用中國方面的責任及創意，以期完成收買的目的。又國民政府自參戰後，盡其一切力量協力日本戰爭，其具體內容如治安的恢復，民心的昂揚，與生產力的增強等，都是盡其最大力量協力戰爭的必要措施，值得加以稱道。從增強日本戰力的見地看來，需求於中國的主要物資為鐵，石炭，螢石，鹽，棉花等。</p>
<p>關於中日物資交流的施策</p>
<p>（三）中國的物價，一般的比日本內地為高，此為事實。此次之所以提出交易營團法及匯兌交易上的特別會計案，即希望對兩地買賣價格的差額，加以適當的調整，雖增加了財政上的負担，但物資的取得計劃，則得以順利進行。</p>
<p>（四）中國的物價問題　中國的物價，相當勝貴，誠如各方面所指摘的情況。尤以生活必須品的勝貴，在中國方面國民生活的維持上，成為很大的問題，必須努力　　抑制，日本方面願相與協力，以期充分安定物價。</p>
<p>（五）通貨膨脹問題　自去年六月至年終，蘇、浙、皖，三角地帶以至於江北地區，漢口地區，廣東，廈門及其他華中華南各主要地區，舊法幣全被驅逐，在進行此通　統一工作時往來的舊法幣所佔的地位，不能不用新通貨替代，在此半年新舊交替過程中，若儲備券不有某程度中，若儲備券不有某程度的增發，則經濟勢必陷於停滯狀態中。（翔：譯自二月七日東京每日新聞）</p>

<p>北京特電　為大東亞戰爭的勃發所捲起的文化旋風，必然使華北的中國人也都崛起注意於大東亞的文藝復興，而成為這一運動的基礎。中國事變以來，華北文化即流於沈寂，大多數中國的文化人潛身在這文化沈澱的泥淖中，至大東亞戰爭勃發，而始發生反應。然而當地的日本人，與之比較起來。仍不改從來的作風，定型的宣撫的色彩依然濃厚，不能不認為是一件憾事。這種文化的沈滯，要不外　地日本人的思想方法（殖民地的看法）的陳腐所致。如此情況，到處可見，因過於謹慎，致文化工作方面顯示出散漫與不同意，而不能樹立　固的文化對策。時至今日，我們渴望確立新的文化理論，我們渴望確立新的文化理論，這在非常時期或許不是無理的要求。所謂文藝復興，所謂文化革新，不用說都在向完遂大東亞戰爭這一雄偉的目標突進。中國的參戰，使華北一億民眾，愈更明瞭這一目的。現在華北為增產糧食勤勞而動員了學生百萬人，作國府參戰後強有力的臂助，踏上了新的階段。在華北教育界新國民運動急速地展開，風氣所及華北狀貌為之一變。運動的指導者，為把握此原理，以為育成強化的泉源，則自應不斷灌輸新的文化理念。所謂中日合作，所謂中日文化交流，如何成為新文化的構成要素，此不外由於如何融合中國人和日本人的心理，注入新的力量。用此有法來觀察華北文化的現狀時，以北京音樂文化協會為中的活動相當活躍。在北京中央公園，建設新音樂堂，同時，去冬山田耕　氏來平，其所作之曲有「紫金城」，未完成者尚有「天壇」等，頗堪注目。</p>
<p>去秋誕生的華北作家協會，為中國的作家惟一團體。該協會成立後，即派遣所遺所屬作家至華北各地農村視察，演講，努力創造新的型式，第二次大東亞文學者大會的華北代表，亦多數由該協會選出。演劇方面，至可悲觀，公立劇塲的設立，意見極為複雜紛歧，各劇團唯有自行改革其組織，適當的人材，很為缺　，亦堪憂慮，但演劇並沒有脫離現實，這或許為釀成未來新機運的可喜現象之一。</p>
<p>華北文化的性格，現在不息地在革新其狀貌，新的氣運正在萌生中，居住華北的四十萬日本人的活動，被這動向的影響所及，不應一刻忘却其所負的職責。這職責的中心，可以「充分的理解中國人」一語包括之。不充分理　中國人，則不能完全把握住中國的思想。我們當然應分担革新華北文化的任務。為樹立大東亞的文化，以完遂大東亞戰爭，我們現在應用全力奮鬥。（翔：譯自二月七日西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>（漢口專電）同仁會診療防疫斑的足跡，遍及中國各方　市，活人無算，受其惠者，不僅日本僑民，中國民眾也得到許多益處。這裏所講的是漢口同仁會診療防疫斑二十年來的光榮成績，到今年為止，漢口同仁會已經整整二十年，它那種熱誠的努力和偉大的貢獻，是值得向讀者介紹的。</p>
<p>大正八年十月，在漢口日租界山崎街籌備創設同仁會，經過五年間的苦心計劃，在大正十二年一月正式成立。有醫師七人，女看護十五人，事務員六人，規模並不怎麼宏大，而且水土不服，衣食住都感不便，排日，侮日的壓迫重重，首任院長石川武雄博士，就在這種困苦環境中奮鬥，努力邁進，以求達到預定目的。大正十五年十二月，武正一博士接任第二任院長，這個時候，中日兩國的風雲，更　複雜微妙，但是同仁會方面，依然艱苦努力，為保障民眾健康，促進彼此交誼，始終不渝。到了昭和二年四月，發生四，三事件，昭和六年七月，長江水災，市內的暴徒出沒不絕，同仁會不辭辛艱，從事救護診療，二個月中晝夜不息，造福於華人者匪淺。昭和十二年七月，不幸中日開戰，同年八月七日，同仁會因為環境所迫，不得已而撤退。</p>
<p>同仁會東京本部，鑒於事變擴大，所以臨時組織了診療救護斑，由武班長率領，十月十四日出發到天津，在天津一帶開始巡迴診療三個月，深入荒村僻壤，經過五十多個地方。同時又有中島班率領醫學人員，在濟南從事診療防疫工作，昭和十三年六月五日轉道到達上海，喘息未過，就開始工作，又再杭州開設診療所，九月下旬班長更調，由新班長中島五六氏領導，集中在上海，靜待武漢攻略的捷報。武漢的火藥氣味漸漸地消散後，十一月三日先有一隊到了漢口，暫借軍特務部內開設診療所，十一月五日診療救護班的全部人員，到了漢口，就開始積極行動。</p>
<p>昭和十五年八月，中島五六氏告辭，就由內藤達男博士繼任班長，十七年五月又調，由　村秀夫博士繼任，先後調動了五位班長，名稱方面也換了三次。初起是同仁會漢口醫院，中間又改稱同仁會漢口診療處，現在叫做同仁會診療防疫班，有醫師十五人，日籍女看護廿四人，華藉女看護二十五人，技術員三人，技術助手四人，事務員七人，　　五人，華人職員四十五人。平均每日門診三百號，其中有半數為華人。</p>
<p>同仁會漢口診療防疫班的事業，非常廣　，各種預防注射，漢口是虎猖獗的地方，現在有了同仁會，能夠消除虎疫，它的職務是何等的重大，除此以外，湖北省政府衛生人員訓練班講　會，也託同仁會幫助，已經有一百八十名學生畢業，附屬華藉女看護學校，從昭和十四年起，到現在已經有四年，每年有十名女看護畢業，同時又承辦軍事當局和各縣縣府委託訓練醫學助手的工作。再要派流動診療班到宜昌和其他沒有醫師的鄉村去施診，一共分為五班，共有一百多人。這種工作對於普及日本醫學，　撫中國民眾，都有極大的貢獻，在時勢需要之中，同仁會的使命是一天一天的重大了。（任：譯自一月二十九日東京每日新聞）</p>

<p>德元首行營十二日海通社電　今日德軍戰報稱、蘇軍因迭受重創、昨日進攻德軍陣地之力量已見薄弱、但德軍之防禦力量則愈戰愈强、蘇軍昨稱利用船隻、企圖在諾伏洛西斯克偷進、結果並未獲逞、蘇軍企圖進擊吾軍在庫彭方面之側翼、結果被吾予以重創擊退、最近二日蘇軍在該處共損失一千七百人、被吾俘獲八百五十人、大　三十五尊及其他步兵軍器甚多、唐納資方面及奧斯哥爾迤西各地、蘇軍之攻勢亦無過去數日之强、庫斯克迤北蘇軍進犯、即爲守軍予以重創擊退、蘇軍進政魯基亦遭擊退、伏洛卓夫、拉多加湖、列寗格勒等地、蘇軍連續進犯亦未獲逞、共計擊毀敵坦克車五十三輛、俘獲敵軍甚多、德機並在該眾擊落敵機二十九架、德機損失三架、</p>

<p>稱爲「陸軍航空部隊之花」的降落傘部隊，於去年二月十四日突然降落蘇門答臘南部要衝巨港，立即加以占領。這一偉大的戰果，全世界爲之震驚。時在大東亞戰爭勃發後的第六十九日，轉瞬間業已一周年，記者由於常地航空部隊的厚意，特乘軍用機訪問巨港，而得以窺見迄今仍嚴守秘密中的日本陸軍降落傘部隊的雄姿，對這歷史的戰跡作詳盡的視察，同時，賴常地將士的幫助，深入叢林地帶，訪問當時指揮降落傘部隊下降的久米部隊長的乘機。</p>
<p>在蘇門答臘的上空俯瞰，大森林猶如一塊廣漠的暗綠色絨毬，在乳白色的雲霧中飛行，前方烟雨縹渺，陣雨時降，莫西河的濁流轉瞬已在眼前。常時我降落傘部隊的大編隊，亦以此莫西河爲路標，從驟而急注中降落敵陣，巨港市街出現於機的右方，飛機作大旋廻飛行，於午後四時前降落於飛機塲。</p>
<p>是日，很幸運的遇到在巨港與降落傘部隊關係特深的將校二人，其一爲近刊一陸軍降落傘部隊的著者野中中佐，其一爲飛行塲某隊長一年前在此地從事決死的奮鬥而榮授名譽感狀的中西部隊長。記者先登最初揭日章旗的司令塔，從中西部隊長而得聞占領時的情况。</p>
<p>挺進隊奮戰的遺跡</p>
<p>在巨港攻略戰中激通，已建聚　　多爲國捐驅的勇士慕標，而竪立着墨痕猶鮮的「挺進隊出戰之跡的紀念碑。詩人蒲生清治中尉及另外數勇士的慕前，　有永著靑綠的「　士松」。野中中佐在此詩人中尉的墓　，親手捧呈了自著一陸軍落上眾部隊」一冊，中西部隊長作了一首　，安　於勇十墓前：</p>
<p>一年了？　　　，（即巨抢）捧呈草花一束，</p>
<p>來拜謁勇士之墓。</p>
<p>鄰旁的　史，</p>
<p>如莫西河的河流，</p>
<p>永古不變。</p>
<p>年輕的土著，在街道附近的叢林中開闢道路，他們每日在勞働，，造新的道路，新的家屋。東西。　一的汕田都市巨港，今为完遂大東亞戰爭的原動力之一，叩肩起了光輝的新使命。不足一年，即已獲此成果，實出於陸軍降落傘部隊奇勛之所賜。由於降落部隊而我們認識了巨港攻略戰的意義，同時，武功的彪炳，亦深固地銘刻在我們的心版上。</p>
<p>戰前，美國對日禁止石油輸出以前，巨港的石油輸入日本的很多。輸往日本的石油，另設一所製煉，質劣而價昂。在巨港攻略戰中，降落傘部隊的任務，用奇襲奪取敵人的安地，並固守以待地上部隊的接應。同時，巨　又爲爪哇攻略戰中日本航空部隊的有力的前進墓地，由此出發于舉而制服爪哇。</p>
<p>對巨港最初的攻　是二月六日，陸军機以遠藤部隊最为指揮，自一月末以來，漸次從追擊自馬來逃避於　　敵機，一舉而　毀十九架，之後，在七日，八日，十三日，繼續攻擊，其間　擊毀戰機共七十七架，敵空軍　力的一部分，蒙受了殲滅的打擊。</p>
<p>去年的二月十四日</p>
<p>至十四日，自馬來〇〇基地離陸的降落傘部隊大編隊，由戰鬥機轟炸機保護，長驅　飛蘇門答臘。一隊於午前十一時二十六分，在巨港飛機塲的南方及西方地區落下，另一隊遲三分鐘在精油所的南方地區降下，同時，挺進隊指揮官久米部隊長機，在飛機塲西南約十公里的凄凉的叢林潮濕地帶中着陸。所有地面上的火器一齊開始射擊，但日本將兵未中一彈，未負一傷，全軍安然降陸。</p>
<p>在降落的地帶，繁生着冲鬱的丈餘喪的灌木，久米部隊長在泥淖沒胸的森林潮濕地帶中强行着陸，當然，不能在一日之間與部隊取得聯絡，於是遂展開苦門，人自爲戰，每一個將上，同時又為指揮官，又爲　　，又爲兵—，僅存的武器？祇身　的手溜彈與手槍，以一當千生，蒲生中尉隻身　領敵高射砲陣地，而終於戰死，他如奧本中尉，德永中尉，廣瀨隊長等英勇戰鬥的情狀，業在當時的新聞中傳頌。溯莫西河飛行的中西部隊亦到着飛行塲開始活躍。如此，精油所，飛行塲，都於一日之間歸日軍之手，而精油所本慮被破壞的，茲亦完好無損，由日軍占領。</p>
<p>探索久米機</p>
<p>翌日記者從事探索於森林地帶强行着陸的久米部隊長機。我們在蘇門答臘大自然的朝霸初曉中，分乘載重汽車出發，一行計鈴木中尉，兵士五名，竹中通譯，連記者共八人。戰重汽車在市街外，卽不能通行，乃捨車步入鄰近大道的部落。但飛機降落的位置，誰也記憶不起，灼熱的赤道下的太陽，偪射全身。間道而進，先期的就的小型機飛臨我們的頭上，操縱者爲諾蒙亨事件時，最初擊墜敵機的木村曹長，在　活的低空飛行中投下二通信筒，幾次向前面飛去而復歸，於是我們遂得以大概的察出飛機的位置，但無法前進，遂中止午前的搜索，以待木村曹長偵察的結果。</p>
<p>此次，木村曹長光行出發，我們一行再進入森林地帶午後五時過後，尚未發見。此日的搜索，遂告絕望，而報告於〇〇部隊長。記者卽行返歸巨港，待數日後再來搜索。</p>
<p>記者先期自巨港與田中少佐同乘他所操縱的小型機在當地上空訪尋，數分鐘後，即已發見此具有歷史意義着陸機，乳白色的機身，在方向舵上陽光顯耀地照射着觸目的降陸傘部隊的符號。翌日，記者再承部隊的好意，僱用當地工人十名，江藤少尉外，一行共十餘名，自午前九時出發，二小時後因當地土著的引導，走出了森林的潮濕地帶，前面力是一條小河，很巧有一只能容三人，半已破敗的小船，勉强分二次波河。</p>
<p>發見機身</p>
<p>約四十分鐘將近目的地，出現了一所住舍。我們老遠的叫喚，沒有回答。小舟的所有人，似是該家的主人。我們用小梯爬上住舍的高處，向四周瞭望，在百十公尺前面的森林地帶，似有長的東西橫亘在那裏。江藤少尉用望遠鏡看時，正是我們所要搜索的着陸機。我們不由自主的大呼萬歲，披荊斬棘，進人當塲，看時懷中的時計時，正爲中午。</p>

<h3 id="c44">改善北站秩序意見 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 滄</p>
<p>其一</p>
<p>日前申報載有盼望華中鐵道公司改善北站進口秩序一文，言頗切實。筆者日前因事往無錫，擬搭乘下午四時之天馬車，於三時前至北站，已人山人海，列隊將至寳山路，有將行李頂在頭上者，有將行李背在背上掛在胸前者，有一手抱小孩一手携行李者，亦有空身無行李者，爭先恐後，大哭小喊，此種嘈囉非身歷　境者，決不知之。鵠立　半小時之久，仍未進寸步，乃趨前至木棚口一探究竟，方知有許多旅客均可化二三十元，由所謂　天嚮導者得設法揷淮前列隊中，以致排在隊後者，永遠落後。幸天未下雨，如遇雨天，則更不堪設想矣。至四時一刻，始得受檢進站，而四時之天馬車早已開行。行旅之苦，莫此爲甚。希望當　者　旅客着想，多開方便之門，謹將愚見所及，請願改善二點如决：</p>
<p>（一）進口之木棚應　加闊，多添檢查口道，則可减少擁擠不少。</p>
<p>（二）空身　行李之旅客，可由正門受檢進站，則秩序并然</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>（一）請求北站憲警，將入站旅客分爲持行李者，和空手拂輕　物　者。</p>
<p>（二）無論持行李之人或空手者，一律須編排單人行列，向原有木棚甬道前進，蓋在旅客心理，與其受重疊傾軋透不出氣的苦楚，寗願拖得行列久候棚外，較爲安全。</p>
<p>（三）請求憲警將搜查時聞略爲提早，使得老弱婦孺們减少久立之苦。（倪家佑）</p>
<p>其三</p>
<p>請求當局（一）謹防敲詐。派便衣暗探私下察訪，遇有敲詐行爲，斟酌懲罰，以儆效尤。（二）嚴持秩序。挨次而排，魚貫而進，嚴禁暴力者取巧傾軋。婦·孺·老邁·少壯者最好分排而列。多設天棚，額定人數，使旅客無過多失空及露天淋雨之苦。至於檢查；深望担任檢查者，勿將旅客物件亂摔，以免失落，最好隨到隨查，則可减少秩序之紊亂，行李衣物，儘量予以通融，俾使歸鄉芥無遺物之苦。（三）增加車班。旅客較事　前爲多，班次則較前减少，　紊亂秩序之一原因，在可能範圍內，請稍增多班次與客車。並特設問訊處於人口顯豁處，便利指導，使旅客無失班之虞。火車本是交通之營業，一般人皆視爲畏途，究非所宜。（華秋果）</p>
<p>其四</p>
<p>閱白虹君改善北站進口秩序，的確非身歷其境，不能盡悉個中情形。誠如白君所　：「强悍者爭先，守秩序者永遠落後。」兩句前余送伯父赴無錫，曾遇　旅客，因遵守秩序之故，已至　七日尚不能進站，遑論上車；若如是在申有錢有住處則尚可，否則若外來旅客，或係失業返鄉者，何堪設想；又若離車站較遠而有行李者，每天　早落夜，受擠挨餓，消耗精力在所不免外，即來回黃包車資已可超過赴杭州或南京之火申資矣。尚有婦孺老年，眞是軋得性命交關，考其原因，實由一般販子造成，所以改善方法須從消滅販子着手，雖然大多販子均爲生活所迫，然爲保障眞正旅客起見，不得不此如。（立人）</p>

<p>— 雲間白蕉</p>
<p>D截長補短，原是游藝的精神，比如喝　了軟酒，有時也要喝口喝硬酒，藉以調調口味；過慣了都市生活，有時也愛過鄉村生活，藉以換換空氣；厭棄了唐、宋八大家的古文調調兒，正不妨讀讀魏，晉文章！</p>
<p>不過以歷史觀來講書學，我以爲應得注意兩點：</p>
<p>「千古書法，只此一途！」這是一個前題。</p>
<p>「人事日趨繁複，書法日務簡便！」——這是書體變遷的一個原則。</p>
<p>諸位試想：從古女變到大篆，變到小篆，從小篆變到隸分，從隸分變到章草，今草，楷書，行書，又楷書從漢經過魏晋六朝到唐初而有定型，今草，行書也　楷書同時產生一直到現在一千七百餘年，沒有變化，這些我想　够解說「前題」了。</p>
<p>拏楷書來比篆隸和分書，寫起來自然要便常，而時間上也比較要節省。在應用方法講，自然書寫越便當越好，時間在越節省越好。所以草書，行同時間也早就成立。—不過書草字畢竟難寫難認，俗語所謂「草字脫了脚，仙人猜弗着，」　以在漢，晋時代，儘管流行於上層社會，而不能普及使大衆應用。因此一日用無窮，與聖同功」的行書，便自然而然成爲社會上比較更廣的一種應用書體。可見歷代書體的變遷，都是因爲實際的需要而改革；同時亦使是因爲實際的需要而存在而盛行。——爲美術的探討，到底是屬於極少數。所以沒有實際需要的，——如今日之篆，隸——僅僅是拏來供文人學士的賞玩而已。——在這一點，我相信也　够說明害體變遷的原則了。</p>
<p>在此，王羲之的被稱爲書聖，可知正不是偶然的事。社會上應用最多的不消說是正書和行書；而　行的極詣，又無人否認是王字。相傳行書書體的創始者是西漢末的頴川劉德昇，其後鍾繇，胡昭俱傳其法，至王義之而登峰造極。羊欣論羲之的書法，說是「貴越羣品，古今莫二；兼撮衆長，備成一家！」這樣稱讚，似　也決與親情無關。拏他來比儒家集大成的至聖先師，也恐正不是我一個人的私見。所以王字的盛行，亦自屬當然的趨勢，初未必由於帝王的愛好。——固然我相信以帝王的地位而提倡石工陶匠的字，也可以風靡一時，但是說因爲帝王提倡石工陶匠的字，便要永爲世法，那我覺得是可疑的一件事。</p>
<p>右軍的書蹟，爲歷代所寳，唐，宋諸大家，又沒有一個不直接間接淵源於他。淳化閣帖一出，影響於後來書學確是更大。但是到了明末董思白的書法，正好似古典的病態美人，他學帖先天不足，後天雖未失調，却是格局不大，氣力有限，又不幸被乾隆帝看中，風行草偃，王帖的天下，從此漸漸式微，好比紅極的柿子，已經拏不起來了！</p>
<p>碑板儘多可學，且學帖必須先學碑。單學帖者患小大，不學碑者缺沉着痛快之致。我人不能因爲「碑學」「帖學」的派別，而可以入主出奴，而可以一筆抹殺！但六朝亂離之際，書法乖謬，不學的書家和不識字的石工陶匠所鑿的字，正好比是一隻生毛　，——而且是被蟲蛀了的生毛桃！包，康兩人去拜服他們合作的法書，那是他　　人的愛吃蟲蛀的生毛桃，是他們的奇嗜！（酬栘濟貧金）　（完）</p>

<h3 id="c85">文人相輕 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 徐明</p>
<p>「文人相輕，自古已然」，這句話是曹丕第一個說的。可是，文人相輕之風，並不是從曹丕那時開始；在曹丕所視爲的古代，已經彼此相輕，所以他說：「自古已然」。曹丕曾舉文人相輕的例子，他所謂的文人，是專指弄文學的人。不錯，做文章的人，常有「文章自己的好」怪癖；對於別人的文章，一味吹毛求疵，認爲「卑卑不足道」。</p>
<p>爲什麼會「文人相輕，自古已然」呢？大槪由於文章是一種藝術品，大體上的好壞雖不難看得出來，不過要制定一個量尺，好像天平，磅秤那樣，來比較各篇文章，究竟好幾分，壞幾分，那是不可能的。這樣，評判文章的精密標準。旣然沒有；於是創作或鑑賞的人，都很易陷於主觀，而「黨同伐異」。「文人相輕」也便「自古已然」了。</p>
<p>其實，推而廣之，人們之彼此相輕，何僅文人？俗話說：「同行必妬」，不是很明顯地說明凡是有利害關係的，不論人與人，或團體與團體，常常因「相妬」而「相輕」嗎？</p>
<p>文人相輕，其方式大致拿文字來諷刺，或打打筆墨官司。非文人相輕，有的村婦謾駡，有的冷嘲熱諷，有的自拉自唱，有的造謠中傷，有的幸災樂禍。「廣告術」的精粹，就基於「相輕」原則，抑人而揚己！</p>
<p>因爲彼此相輕，文字是一種有力工具；於是利用文字相輕，不僅是文人與文人了。</p>
<h3 id="c86">庭園改植蔬菜 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— 黃振榮</p>
<p>經濟學家李權時先生，在「參戰與人民」大會中的演說，詳闡糧食菜蔬和戰時的重要性，盼望上海的居民能於私人的庭園，改植菜蔬，以增加生產，而减輕日常生活的負擔，這是一個很重要而有深長意義的建議！</p>
<p>在眼前生活程度是如此的高漲，當然富裕之家，尚能靠早日購進的大米，毋庸擔憂食米的不足，可是一般中小的薪金階級，平日的一點收入，來維持生活已感到氣喘不過，那有餘錢來購置囤積，祇有一致的盼望戶口米的增加，因爲若單靠目前分配的數額，就是一天三頓薄粥還是不够塡滿肚子的！</p>
<p>當時一般中小薪金階級，他們平日住的是暗淡的亭子問或擱樓，那有多餘的園庭來供餘暇欣賞花木，那麼將庭園改植菜蔬，祇有讓一般家庭富裕設有園圃的人來提倡了！</p>
<p>中國人一般的家庭娛樂，便是閑來麻將打幾圈，以資消遣，這種惡習，差不多成了都市人們一般的毛病。更有些遊藝塲所尋歡作樂，可以說目前社會滿目瘡痍，大牛都是有錢所作所爲的結果。因此使我們想起，要提倡正當的娛樂，才是消除不良娛樂惟一對症下藥的良方！</p>
<p>如是我們設法在花圃庭園，種植一家所歡喜而必需的蔬菜，親自耕植和管理，利用在早晚工作的餘暇，做些灌漑的工作。我相信這種耕耘的操作，使久困於都市生活的人們，能够嘗試這田園的樂趣，同時又可節省金錢和精神於無益而耗神的不正當娛樂上。</p>
<p>凡家有庭園的人們，眞是何樂而不爲呢！瞧吧！寒冷的冬天已將過去了，帶來的是風和日暖的春天，花木正　欣欣向榮了，那麼我們也得準備　來，來顯顯我們做個園藝家的身手！</p>
<h3 id="c87">上海文化小學故 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 小清</p>
<p>上海有活字鉛印刷術還是始於同治初年。在以前上海的書籍，都是由木刻印的。後來有一個基督教教士，名叫麥特赫斯脫（Medhurst）　到上海來傳敎。因了傳敎上種種不便。便感到有設立印書館之必要，在宣敎方面，更能收事半功倍之效。本來麥氏在倫敦爲做印刷生意的人，因此靠了他豐富的經騐，創立了墨海書館。（L．M．S．Press）於是上海才開始有用機器來印刷的鉛印本書籍了。他這印書館在當時看來是一件咄咄怪事。麥氏的印書館是利用牛來拖動機軸（那時上海還沒有電力）與今日用馬達來旋轉機軸眞有天壤之別。現在上海印刷事業蒸蒸日上，日新月異，其功不能不歸於麥氏罷。</p>
<p>上海之始有話劇是在光緒二十八年（即一九〇二年）十一月。上海基督敎所辦的約翰書院始演話劃。繼之爲徐滙公學。惟所演皆爲西洋劇本，而且約翰學生所操言語爲英語。徐滙學生所操爲法語。故非熟知英法文字者茫然莫名其妙不知所演。用華語演話劇實始於南洋公學。時光緒二十九年（一九〇三年）適値拳匪之亂故借寒假私取「義和團事編成新劇，於課堂試演，故知者極少。直到光緒三十一年，（一九〇五年）民立中學學生汪優游借年假餘暇創立文友會，取社會上之時事而益世道者，編纂新劇假畫錦牌坊陳宅試演，觀者極多，開今日話劇之先聲。</p>
<p>上海何時有西洋電影已不可考。約在淸同治末十年間了。葛元煦在淸光緒二年所出滬游雜記中已有記載，其中說：「西洋影戲台前張白布大幔，以水濕之中藏燈匣。匣內置洋畫更番替換光射布上則山水樹木，樓閣人物鳥獸蟲魚光怪陸離諸狀畢現恍如身歷其境頗爲可觀。」後來西班牙人雷摩在光緒三十年左右在四爲路靑蓮閣下設一小小電影館，惟所演者皆爲短片，當時已認爲新奇事業了。</p>
<h3 id="c88">徵文逸話 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 友龍</p>
<p>讀了十八日本刊頌揚名獲微文亞軍的賈老先生一文後，筆者被打動了心機，一也有幾句話」說了。</p>
<p>賈老先生老當益壯。肯和靑年們一較勝負，這種「不自孤傲」的態度，實在佩服之至，恰巧在那佳作入選的姓名中，找出了和賈老先生媲美的人。—那便是蔣平階老先生。—年齡將近「花甲」了。</p>
<p>蔣老先生是太倉人—和筆者是同鄉，但聞名而不相識。—自以苦學而獲得成就的，對於國學具着高深的造詣，詩詞歌賦，無所不能，目下筆迅速，更爲特長，他歷任中學師範的國文敎師，一臨敎壇，精神充足，講述盡致，爲太倉中學國文敎師中首屈一指。他服務敎界，已很長久，所以在事變前，已獲得敎廳「養老金」的優遇了。養老金是不容易享受的，因爲旣要服務年久，又須成績優良，所以蔣老先生常以此沾沾自喜。現在因事過境遷，所以他仍在申江執敎，沒有結東他的粉筆生涯。</p>
<p>「徵文」是很好的事情，聚集了年齡不同，性別不同，職業不同的各個作品，品優評劣，的確增加了讀者的興趣不少。可是參加的大都存了一個希望心—「入選」「得獎金」—這是不對的，我們知道人多名額少，誰能保不「名落孫山」？我們要像那賈蔣兩先進，抱着「業餘」爲「增加寫作技能」及「爲興趣」而參加才是，入選固屬欣幸，落選也是無妨，才合了「參加微文」的本旨。</p>
<p>筆者有一個朋友，前年爲了參加一個微文競選，他廢寢忘食，窮一星期的時間，成了一篇二萬字的長文，因爲獎金極厚，所以他滿懷希望勝利的到來。可是後來揭曉，恰沒有「份兒」，他兌大哭一塲，立誓不再參加徵文的寫作。奉勸諸位，在參加本報的徵文時，切不可有這樣的情形，否則，非惟無益，抑且有害！</p>

<p>— 岳浩</p>
<p>一個有爲的靑年，是在不斷的理論學習，和工作鍛鍊中，體味着，認識着人生的眞義。要奮鬥，但先要有眞實的技能，要堅忍，但先要有不屈的修養；怎樣能　到這個目標，必須多讀書，多工作。讀書興趣，最好在幼年時代養成，到壯年老年方才有這種良好習慣，讀書不僅是在學校內應有的事，離開了學校，仍舊可以繼續。書本上告訴吾們的，不過是一些抽象的，理論的，但是系統的基本知識未必一定能符合眞正的人生。廣大的宇宙。到處是你學習的園地，一草一木，一山一水都是你研究的對象，大自然是一所設備完善的最高學府，那裏包涵着正確的意識，奧妙的哲學，神秘的科學，人類的智能所能摸索到的，文字所能發表的，僅是最小的一角，決不是一個全面，不過書本能　獻你一條深入的門徑，指示你一個試探的方案，把書本上所告訴你的，奉爲金科玉律，呆板的强記學習，最多把你裝成一部百科全書，供人翻閱，但是人的精力究竟有限，那能如此呢？一部二十四史，已够你一生麻煩，强記，但是又有何出處呢？所以讀書貴在活的運用而不在死的背誦，必須跟着時代的進步，用客斷的眼光，加以參考體味，不觀的懷疑，不斷的改革，把生活和時代配會起來，接近世界，接近事物，作進一步的認識，進一步的實踐。讀書不過是學做人的道理，把生活和時代的環境打成一片。拋却死讀書的觀念，從而認職讀書的目的，再來確定一個計劃和方法，不僅向有形的書本負責下功夫，否則必爲環境所淘汰，必須放開眼界向着廣大的社會去研究，去觀察，拿來充實人生，運才有意義。</p>
<p>至於工作，那是一種理論的實踐，人格的表現。要生存必須勞動，那裏有着最崇高的興趣，最公平的酬報，人的一生，本來是一部繼被不斷的齒輪，絕不容許稍有阻滯，愈磨鍊，愈精釆。不絕的工作，才有不斷的進步，世界文明跟着日新月異，讀書不過告訴我們怎樣才工作，工作才解決我們生活，這是一種合理的自然發展，決設有絲毫可羞恥的地方，不勞而獲的心理，在一般人有着毒性的寄存，他們以爲工作是一種無可逃避的苦役，而忽略了他至聖的眞義，寗願伸着頸子，等待着不可期望的上蒼賜予他們麵包，而忘記了天賦的兩手，到處可以製造麵包，這種奴隸性的暴露，是多麼够可憐的一件事。</p>
<p>因此，對工作應該抱着一種興趣，一種自信，否則精神萎靡，神氣散漫，祇有漆黑的反面，永見不到光明的正面。</p>
<p>靑年們，應該如何的認識本位，每天讀書每天工作，不斷地求進步，到處感到興趣，這才是一條康莊大道。</p>

<p>笑話—因爲福勒斯特是勃洛克菲爾德初次見到的最渺小的新學生—大約高出他那泥汚的足球鞋，只有四呎。（可是到底不完全是笑話，你以後就可以知道：因爲他在一九一八年戰死了—在剛白萊（Cambrai）上空的火燄中，　打落了下來。）不過誰也沒有想到前途究竟有些什麼。第一次勃洛克菲爾德的老朋友戰死時—在九月裏—似乎悲壯得足得轟動一時。這個消息來時，吉普斯想：一百年以前，這個學校裏的學生都在「對」法國人作戰。眞有些希奇，某一代人的犧牲却要這樣取消另一代人的犧牲。他將這個意見講給校舍部主　布雷治（Blades）　聽布雷治十八歲，已經在受着軍官的訓練，聽了這話，只是笑笑。無論如何，那種歷史上的陳跡與現在有什麼關係呢？正是老吉普斯的怪僻思想之一，沒有別的道理。（卅四）社會服務</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Premise of "Total War Participation" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>After entering the war, the National Government has only one central goal for all facilities: to concentrate the nation's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to adapt to the new political needs and fulfill the task of cooperating with Japan and defending East Asia. To accomplish this major task, the government's national policy must be rapidly concretized and legalized, because the concretization and legalization of national policy is the prerequisite for concentrating national power and also the prerequisite for practicing the war to defend East Asia. If the government has a general mobilization law, clearly stipulating what the general public's obligations to the state during wartime should be, it means indicating what the state requires of every citizen in the positive aspect, and what restrictions are to be imposed in the negative aspect. The people can then understand the actual relationship between participating in the war and the people. They do not need to be panicked by rumors, nor do they need to fear unreasonable demands because of the law. As long as the people actively abide by the law and fulfill their obligations, the government should provide them with protection and encouragement. At the same time, no one can be an exception before the law, and the habit of procrastination and leakage can be completely eliminated before the law, so that society becomes a wartime society, politics and economy become wartime politics and economy, and the general public's life becomes a truly wartime national life. Only then can the concentration of national power be truly realized, can the cooperation with Japan and the defense of East Asia be practiced, and then can the final victory be expected.</p>
<p>The law of concentrating national power, or the strict general mobilization law, lies in concentrating and utilizing all manpower and material resources to strengthen the power of cooperation in the Great East Asia War. Therefore, in terms of mobilizing materials, it should include all military supplies such as weapons and ammunition, military equipment, food and clothing, hygiene and medicine, transportation and communication, transport, civil engineering, construction, fuel, and electricity, as well as the raw materials and machinery required for their production, repair, control, supply, and preservation. The scope of mobilization should be clearly defined. Secondly, in terms of national general mobilization business, such as production, repair, control, supply, import and export, storage, testing, research, monopoly of daily necessities, finance, transportation, communication, health, rescue, relief, information, propaganda, education, training, requisition, conscription, civil engineering construction, and even the maintenance of social order, supervision of markets, protection of transportation, and air defense and other businesses, all should be clearly defined by law and implemented to mobilize the people to carry out. It is not only necessary to mobilize defense-related materials, but also to control general raw materials and people's daily necessities; not only to mobilize materials, but also to target businesses, so that the people can make the greatest efforts to adapt to the characteristics of modern total war, in order to supplement the massive consumption in the Great East Asia War, support the long-term war, and expect the final victory.</p>
<p>The law of concentrating national power must include manpower, material resources, financial resources, and cultural aspects, making simple and clear regulations: (1) Regarding manpower, the use, employment, dismissal, wages, and other labor conditions of laborers should be decided by the government in consideration of the overall situation. Appropriate measures should be taken for labor-capital disputes and strikes, so that the capital side should not only calculate its own current profits, and the labor side should not take behaviors such as strikes or strikes, in order to increase wartime production. For talents, implement universal investigation and registration, so that talents in all aspects can be concentrated around the national policy to seek its implementation. However, the concentration of manpower depends entirely on the voluntary cooperation of the people, so political propaganda and public opinion mobilization must be the first priority. Only when necessary can the use of legal provisions be lightly used. (2) Regarding material resources, the key is to ensure that the needs of national defense are met at any time, and at the same time, it is necessary to take into account the practical guarantee of the minimum material life of the people. Therefore, the active and planned development of production to increase material resources is the first priority. At the same time, it stipulates how to control all material resources in the country in the negative aspect. All matters related to the production, transportation, sale, use, repair, storage, consumption, transfer, or transfer of material resources should clearly define the principles and methods of management and guidance. In particular, there should be clear regulations on the prices and quantities of market transactions, and on the exchange of import and export materials. As for the civilian materials that need to be concentrated by the state, purchase should be the principle, and requisition should never be implemented unless necessary. Regarding the work of general mobilization, it is also necessary to encourage the people to be happy to engage in it, with guidance and adjustment as the principle. (3) In terms of financial resources, the first priority is to control finance, guide idle funds to adapt to national policy, develop production, and increase wartime national power. The circulation of currency in the exchange area, the exercise of people's claims, the performance of debts, the establishment, reorganization, suspension, and closure of banks, companies, factories, and other organizations, the movement of funds of banks, companies, and factories, the scope and price of public bonds and stock markets must be clearly stipulated to be managed or controlled by the government. In particular, the control of capital utilization can make it develop towards the necessary sectors of wartime industry and prevent waste in unnecessary production businesses. If the profits of banks, companies, and factories are restricted by the government, or wartime excess profits taxes are levied, or they are reinvested in government-designated industries, it can also prevent the uneasy factors of excessive disparity between the rich and the poor in wartime society and increase the people's confidence in the government.</p>
<p>Concentrating national power and mobilizing national manpower, material resources, and financial resources is the biggest task after participating in the war, but this is by no means something that can be achieved with a few slogans. Therefore, laws regarding general mobilization are necessary today. In the practice of general mobilization, concentrate national power, make planned, unified, and rational use; strictly organize, practically adjust politics, economy, and society to form an organic wartime system, so as to cope with the long-term nature of modern warfare and strive for the final victory.</p>

<p>Important Report by Finance Minister Zhou</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - Zhou Fohai, Minister of Finance and President of the Central Reserve Bank, made a detailed report on the unification of the monetary system and the management of finance at today's (12th) National Economic Committee. The important paragraph of its conclusion is hereby published as follows:</p>
<p>First, there is a strange rumor in Shanghai that the government is going to issue another kind of currency. Anyone with a little common sense will know that this rumor is completely false and not true. The government has worked so hard to make the circulation of the Central Reserve Bank notes universal and to make the foundation of the Central Reserve Bank notes solid. How could it issue a new currency and completely overturn the achievements of its past efforts? Therefore, I am responsible for guaranteeing that the government will never do such a childish thing.</p>
<p>Second, some people say that the Central Reserve Bank notes have no reserve for issuance. This is also completely untrue. According to the Central Reserve Bank Law, the reserve for issuance is 40% in cash and 60% in guarantee. But in fact, our current cash reserve is more than 70%, and the guarantee reserve is less than 30%. With such a solid reserve, is it not sound?</p>
<p>Third, some people suspect that the exchange rate of the Central Reserve Bank notes against the Japanese yen will change. This is also unnecessary worry. Not only does our government want to firmly maintain the current exchange rate, but the friendly Japanese government also fully cooperates in maintaining this exchange rate. We can see from Minister Aoki's reply at the meeting that he said, "The exchange rate of 100 Central Reserve Bank notes to 18 Japanese yen, the National Government's policy is to maintain it no matter what. Our government also fully agrees and will continue to adhere to this exchange rate." Both China and Japan have this policy, so I am also responsible for guaranteeing that the exchange rate of the Central Reserve Bank notes against the Japanese yen will never change.</p>
<p>Fourth, some people think that the Central Reserve Bank notes are issued too much and there are signs of inflation. This is also not true. Inflation is when the supply of currency exceeds the currency needs on the market. Now, has the supply of the Central Reserve Bank notes exceeded the needs on the market? Absolutely not, and there is still a shortage of supply. We can see from the high interest rates on the market that the interest rate is as high as 3%. What is the reason for this? It is that the supply of the only legal tender, the Central Reserve Bank notes, is not enough. The issuance of the Central Reserve Bank notes cannot yet meet the needs for the Central Reserve Bank notes. How can it be said that there is inflation? Needless to say, the amount of Central Reserve Bank notes issued in the past year has increased rapidly, but there are two reasons for this. The first is that the circulation area has expanded from the three provinces and two cities in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to Wuhan and South China. The second is the prohibition of the circulation of old currencies. If the amount issued within a limited area increases like this, there will of course be inflation. However, the amount of Central Reserve Bank notes issued increases with the expansion of the circulation area. In other words, the supply increases with the increase in demand, so it cannot cause inflation. Furthermore, if the circulation of old currencies had not been prohibited and the issuance of Central Reserve Bank notes had increased like this, the market would have suddenly increased by so many chips, which could also cause inflation. However, old currencies have disappeared from the market. The Central Reserve Bank notes are only supplementing the gaps left by old currencies. In other words, the Central Reserve Bank notes only take the place of old currencies. The market has not increased chips, so how can there be inflation? Therefore, whether from a theoretical point of view or from a factual point of view, there are no signs of inflation.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Japanese Army Announces War Situation of One Week <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Chinese Expeditionary Army Press Department announced the war situation of one week on February 12 as follows: In North China, a sweeping operation was launched against about 8,000 soldiers and bandits in Shanxi, Hebei, and Chahar. Work such as defending the security area, building fortresses, and advancing the excavation of trenches is actively carried out to establish the construction of the security circle. An annihilation war was carried out in various places in the central and southern regions of Hebei Province. The northern part of Shandong Province has launched a punitive operation since mid-January. In one month, a great war result of about 800 enemy corpses abandoned and about 400 prisoners was obtained. In the Wuhan area of Central China, a cleanup war was launched, and a great effect of ensuring the security of the surroundings of Wuhan was achieved. From the 5th to the 9th, the Army Air Force bombed Lushi (Henan), Lingling (Hunan), Ankang (Shaanxi), Guoyang (Anhui), Laokou (Hubei), Huizhou (Anhui), Guilin, Liuzhou (Guangxi) and other places for days, and also sank 12 enemy transport ships in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The comprehensive activity of the Japanese Army Air Force is enough to crush the enemy air force's attempt to stir up trouble.</p>
<h3 id="e5">The National Government's Participation in the War Is a Landmark Great Undertaking <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - The editorial of the February issue of the "Diplomatic Review" magazine here, titled "The National Government's Participation in the War," commented in detail on the National Government's participation in the war. The main points are as follows: The participation of the National Government of the Republic of China in the war this time is a landmark great undertaking in the more than 4,000-year history of China, and it is the foundation for creating a new history of Great East Asia. This is of great significance in world history. Therefore, the nature of the Sino-Japanese Incident has an inseparable relationship with the Great East Asia War, making the Chongqing side completely lose the meaning of resisting the war. The culprit of the Sino-Japanese Incident this time is not only Chiang Kai-shek personally. The real enemies are Britain and the United States, because Britain and the United States have done everything possible to manipulate and support the Chongqing side in order to fuel the war and consume their own strength, so as to fulfill their ambition to invade East Asia. We have clearly pointed out such conspiracies when the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, and their hideous faces have now been fully exposed. Fortunately, Wang Jingwei has unique insights and understands the conspiracies of Britain and the United States, so he resolutely gathered patriotic comrades, ran for peace, returned to Nanjing, and signed the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty with Japan, working together to build a new order in East Asia, thereby gaining the love of the people of the whole country and laying the foundation for the revival of China. At this point, the nature of Japan's punitive war against the Chongqing side in the Sino-Japanese Incident has also developed into Sino-Japanese cooperation to seek the revival of China and the defense of East Asia. The Chongqing side has lost the meaning of continuing the war of resistance. However, the Chongqing side is still obsessed and willing to be a vassal of Britain and the United States, continuing the meaningless war of resistance. At the time of the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, it dared to disregard the wishes of the Chinese people and joined the anti-Axis front, trying to hinder the progress of the Great East Asia Liberation Holy War. Although it uses the slogan of resisting the war to save the country, it is actually willing to be the vanguard of Britain and the United States, the common enemy of China and Japan, in invading East Asia. This is completely contrary to the Chinese people's determination to destroy Britain and the United States. As a result, it will inevitably suffer the consequences and collapse with Britain and the United States. When the National Government participated in the war, China and Japan simultaneously signed the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration on Cooperating to Complete the War, and agreements on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. Japan returned the exclusive concessions in China, recognized China's recovery of the administrative power of the public concessions as soon as possible, and abolished extraterritorial rights in China. All of this was the greatest national shame and the most unequal treaty of China in the past 100 years under the aggression of Britain and the United States. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's first goal of implementing the National Revolution was also here. At the time of the National Government's participation in the war this time, in order to express friendship and good faith to China, Japan resolutely signed the above-mentioned agreement with China, thus raising China's status and enhancing the National Government's strength. Looking back at October of last year, when Britain and the United States verbally declared the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights in order to realize their conspiracy to use the Chongqing side to resist Japan, they were actually deceiving China. In fact, the concessions they called had already been lost. At the same time, they still refused to give China equal treatment, attempting to jointly manage China after the war. From the hypocritical and deceptive attitude of Britain and the United States, it is even more sufficient to show the friendliness and fairness of Japan's attitude towards China this time. Based on this, the National Government's participation in the war this time is an essential element for the revival of China, and Japan's return of concessions and abolition of extraterritorial rights are also the inevitable development of the conditions for the basic relations between China and Japan. Because of the National Government's participation in the war, the Great East Asia War, with its abundant manpower and material resources, is fully cooperating, and all ethnic groups in East Asia have completely stood on the same front. To complete the war and destroy Britain and the United States, victory is already in hand, and the realization of the Great East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is already in sight.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing telegram, the Chongqing English Times published an article on the 12th stating that we recognize Chongqing's urgent need for aircraft, but if the air force does not have the close cooperation of the army and navy, it will still not be able to attack the enemy's homeland. Therefore, Chongqing not only needs aircraft, but also needs a large amount of ammunition to form a powerful force. Therefore, defeating the Japanese army in Burma and opening the Burma Road is an urgent task and a real condition for the destruction of the Japanese army.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Since China and Japan signed the agreement on Japan's abolition of extraterritorial rights in China on January 9, people in general have been concerned about what order Japan will follow to implement it. On the 12th, the editorial of the Mainichi Shimbun here was titled "The Order of Abolishing Extraterritorial Rights," and it added comments. The main idea is that the so-called extraterritorial rights in China include various rights, such as consular jurisdiction, inland navigation rights, taxation rights, and police rights. Some people believe that it may be difficult to realize the abolition of these rights in one fell swoop, judging from the state of preparation for reception on the part of the National Government and the current living conditions of Japanese residents in China. However, we believe that there is really no room for discussion in this opinion. However, when we implement the abolition of extraterritorial rights, we should consider the actual situation of both parties, try to avoid chaos, and abolish them step by step in order to make it easier for the National Government to receive them. Then, the question is which rights to start with first. After reviewing the results from all aspects, we believe that it is still most appropriate to abolish taxation rights first, because not only is it easier for the National Government to receive taxation rights, but it is also unlikely to cause unnecessary chaos in practice. Officials of the relevant authorities said that the reason for deciding to abolish taxation rights first is probably here.</p>

<h3 id="e14">The Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Submarine War Results in Australia – Sinking of 54,000 Tons of Enemy Ships – Japanese Air Force Bombs American and British Positions <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 12th that Imperial Navy submarines, from mid-January to early February, sank six enemy ships totaling 54,000 tons off the east coast of Australia.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Domei News Agency) – A naval commentator for Domei News Agency recently commented on the communique released today by the Imperial Headquarters, stating that with Japanese submarines intensifying their activities on the Allied supply routes in the Pacific, leading to the east coast of Australia, the communication lines between the United States and Australia are further endangered. The commentator also cited sources close to the Navy, stating that the Imperial Headquarters announced the sinking of six enemy ships totaling 54,000 tons, including one 10,000-ton and one 8,000-ton freighter, and one 8,000-ton transport ship sunk in mid-January and near the end of January; and two 8,000-ton freighters and one 12,000-ton freighter sunk in February. The operations of Japanese submarines in that area of the Pacific pose a serious threat to Australia, because the country's important economic resources pass through the waters off the east coast of Australia, and Australia is the most important base for Allied counter-offensive against Japan in the neighboring islands. Given the daily shortage of Allied ships, Australia is experiencing a shortage of supplies. The loss of six ships by the United States and Australia is indeed a serious blow.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Same as above) – A spokesman for the Information Bureau stated today in a discussion with foreign journalists that the achievements of the Japanese army in Guadalcanal Island and Buna (New Guinea) during six months of fighting are comparable to the glorious victory in Singapore a year ago. The heavy losses suffered by the Allied forces' aircraft and combatants in these areas are unprecedented in history. The enemy land and naval forces dispatched to the remote front lines of the South Pacific are small, but sufficient to lure a large number of enemy ships, aircraft, and soldiers, resulting in unprecedented and massive losses. The results of this campaign have demonstrated the absolute success of the Japanese strategy. In this six-month period, from August 7th of last year to February 7th of this year, the results include sinking or damaging ten battleships, eight aircraft carriers, forty-two cruisers, thirty-seven destroyers, ten submarines, two minesweepers, ten torpedo boats, three ships of unclear classification, and twenty-three transport ships. These losses indicate that the main force and the majority of the pre-war fleet of the United States have been destroyed. No other navy in the world has achieved such significant results in such a short period of time as the Japanese Navy.</p>

<p>Shonan, 12th (Central News Agency) – The supreme commander of the Japanese Malaya and Sumatra forces issued a statement of his thoughts on the upcoming first anniversary of the fall of Singapore, stating in essence: Since the complete occupation of Singapore on February 15th of Showa 17 (1942), the largest British stronghold in the conquest of East Asia for a century, the emotions are linked to it. Especially, deep respect should be paid to the loyal spirits who fought for victory. Recalling the reasons for the success of the capture of Singapore, although the strategy and tactics of the Japanese army were superior to the enemy's, it was also due to the strong attacking spirit and belief in victory of the soldiers. As the first anniversary of the occupation approaches, this place has become the center of operations in the South. Now, as we intensify construction with new forces, we cannot help but recall the hardships of the soldiers a year ago, and we hope to gather even greater overall strength in the future to advance towards the path of certain victory in the Great War, and strive to establish permanent peace in Greater East Asia.</p>

<h3 id="e18">British Members of Parliament Express Concern Over Gandhi's Health – Indian Chamber of Commerce Cables Viceroy Linlithgow Requesting Unconditional Release <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 12th (Agency not named) – According to reports from London, the British side is increasingly concerned about Gandhi's hunger strike and the anxiety it is causing among the Indian people. When the Secretary of State for India, Amery, attended the House of Commons yesterday, many members of Parliament inquired about the health of Gandhi and Nehru's daughter. Amery replied that Gandhi's health was no different from ordinary people when he decided to start the 21-day hunger strike. He had no report on the health of Nehru and his daughter. He was unwilling to announce much about the correspondence between Gandhi and Viceroy Linlithgow. The Indian independence movement is still very active, although newspapers are prohibited from publishing news about it, similar to the situation when it was launched on August 8th of last year. A total of 60,229 people were arrested last autumn, and half of them, 39,498, had not been released by December 1st. He could not announce whether more people had been arrested since then. However, it can be said that before December 1st of last year, British police had been "forced" to open fire 470 times, and the British army had opened fire 18 times.</p>
<p>Gandhi's Correspondence with the Viceroy</p>
<p>In addition, the correspondence between Gandhi and the Viceroy was released in New Delhi today. It reveals that the Indian government, deeply afraid that Gandhi's hunger strike would cause unrest, suggested restoring Gandhi's freedom during his hunger strike, but Gandhi resolutely refused and reiterated that his hunger strike was a protest against the detention of himself and his comrades. "If I am temporarily released for my convenience, that is not what I want. I would rather fast as a prisoner, and I don't imagine fasting as a free man. If I am released under the conditions proposed in my letter, then the hunger strike can be avoided. Otherwise, I would not like to hope for release under false pretenses." The Indian government replied, "You will bear the responsibility for any accidents that occur due to the hunger strike." According to reports from Bombay, Gandhi is awaiting doctors Naya and Kilde to prepare medicine. According to news from Wardha, Professor Penshri, a follower of Gandhi, also began a hunger strike yesterday afternoon after hearing about Gandhi's hunger strike.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Domei News Agency) – The Bombay Indian Chamber of Commerce cabled the Indian Viceroy Linlithgow yesterday, requesting the unconditional release of Gandhi. Indian chambers of commerce and other organizations will also make similar appeals. In addition, all yarn factories in Ahmedabad have closed for three days, and the Bombay market is still closed.</p>
<p>Gandhi's Hunger Strike is Now in its Eighth Day</p>
<p>Ankara, 11th (Havas News Agency) – According to news from New Delhi, Gandhi's hunger strike has lasted for three days. He only took orange juice today. British officials are quite worried about his voluntary hunger strike. Gandhi is on a hunger strike to strengthen his resistance, which is now in its eighth time. However, Gandhi's health has not been very good recently, and at the age of over seventy, the hunger strike will inevitably increase his weakness. The Indian Viceroy has personally instructed doctors to be on standby around Gandhi at all times. At the same time, British people in India are extremely concerned about the reactions that may occur after Gandhi's death.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Indian Independence League authorities here issued their views on Gandhi's hunger strike on the 11th, stating that Gandhi began his hunger strike on the 10th. The British government claims that the anti-British movement in India is the responsibility of Gandhi alone. Today, Gandhi and other leaders of the Indian independence movement cannot expose the illegal domination of Britain. This is just a malicious propaganda of the British side. Gandhi is already seventy-five years old. Before the start of the non-cooperation movement, he had already lost his health. Now, he is carrying out a three-week hunger strike with his old and sick body. We express our deep concern, and this will also arouse the unanimous anger of Indians in India and around the world.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 12th (Domei News Agency) – The spokesman for the Information Bureau stated today in a meeting with foreign journalists that the dispatch of Lieutenant General Arnold and General Dill to Chongqing by Britain and the United States was an attempt to quell Chongqing's dissatisfaction with the Casablanca Conference and its future requests for aid. However, in the next few months, Chongqing will again cry out for the lack of material assistance and the failure to implement promises. Madame Wellington Koo has frankly admitted that "China today is closer to collapse on the economic front than at any time since the war." American military representatives in Chongqing are making every effort to explain the reasons for not inviting Chongqing to participate in the desert conference and to praise Chongqing's so-called heroic resistance. In addition, they are exaggerating Chongqing's role in this war and fabricating illusions of post-war reconstruction for Chongqing, constantly promising verbal assurances that Britain and the United States will provide Chongqing with assistance, and boasting about the Allied "victory" in the South Pacific and the grand plan to recover Burma and reopen the Burma Road. The leaders of Chongqing may have been temporarily comforted by these verbal favors. However, what Chongqing really needs is not just the visit of British and American leaders or their verbal promises of assistance, because such promises have been made too often in the past. A well-known visitor to the US State Department, Smith, said, "Extreme danger, children walk with demons, until the storm passes." These words can greatly illustrate the attitude of the United States towards the "Allies." The storm mentioned by Smith has completely blown British and American forces out of the Western Pacific, and there is no longer any danger. From this, it can be seen that Britain and the United States no longer want to walk with the Chongqing demons. However, another cry for aid is now wafting in the wind.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia, Aoki, Explains Chinese Currency Issues <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>On February 6th, at the Special Wartime Legal Act Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives, Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki explained the issues of Chinese currency, goods, and prices. A brief account was published in the February 10th issue of this newspaper on page 4. Now, as reported by the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, a more detailed translation is provided below. – Editor's Note</p>
<p>At the Special Wartime Administrative Exceptions Law Committee of the House of Representatives, Mr. Matsumoto Tadao questioned matters of utmost importance to enhancing productivity, such as the state of procurement of goods in China, the exchange rate between military scrip and reserve certificates, and price policies in Central China. Minister Aoki replied: The exchange rate between military scrip and reserve certificates will remain unchanged. Regarding the procurement of goods, it is planned to make full use of the increasingly vigorous cooperation and creativity of the Chinese side since their participation in the war. The Chinese side has also emphasized that it will declare and enhance productivity to assist Japan as much as possible. Thus, Minister Aoki explained the basic policy of Japan's economic and financial policies toward China, and the status of Chinese goods supplied, which are extremely important to the goods mobilization plan, which is worth paying attention to. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Work of Transporting Goods in Central China: Since the National Government abolished the equal value policy of reserve certificates and old legal tender in March of last year in order to stabilize the value of the reserve certificates themselves, it was immediately decided that the exchange rate of 18 military scrip to 100 reserve certificates would remain unchanged. The question of what kind of currency should be used when purchasing necessary goods is an urgent issue to be resolved in Central and South China. During the past year, the unification of reserve certificates in the main areas of China's Central and South China has been completed, and there is no obstacle to the use of reserve certificates when purchasing various goods. The Japanese side, of course, maintains the policy of using reserve certificates to the extent possible.</p>
<p>(2) The Status of Goods Procurement: Next, regarding cotton and other agricultural products that are directly related to the Chinese people, we are strongly requesting the assistance of the Chinese side, and utilizing the responsibility and creativity of the Chinese side in order to achieve the purpose of procurement. The National Government has also been cooperating with Japan's war with all its strength since its participation in the war. The specific contents such as the restoration of security, the elevation of the people's hearts, and the enhancement of productivity are necessary measures to cooperate with the war with the greatest possible strength, which is worth praising. From the viewpoint of enhancing Japan's war power, the main goods needed from China are iron, coal, fluorite, salt, cotton, etc.</p>
<p>Measures for the Exchange of Goods between China and Japan</p>
<p>(3) Prices in China are generally higher than in Japan, which is a fact. The reason why the Trading Corporation Law and the Special Accounting Act on Exchange Transactions are proposed this time is to make appropriate adjustments to the difference in purchase and sale prices between the two places. Although it increases the financial burden, the goods acquisition plan can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>(4) The Problem of Prices in China: Prices in China are quite expensive, as has been pointed out in various quarters. In particular, the expensiveness of daily necessities has become a major problem for the maintenance of the national livelihood in China, and efforts must be made to suppress it. The Japanese side is willing to cooperate with each other in order to fully stabilize prices.</p>
<p>(5) The Problem of Inflation: From June to the end of last year, the old legal tender was completely expelled from the triangular area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the Jiangbei area, the Hankou area, Guangdong, Xiamen, and other major areas of Central and South China. In the process of unifying this currency, the position occupied by the old legal tender in the past cannot but be replaced by new currency. In this six-month process of alternating between the old and the new, if the issuance of reserve certificates is not increased to a certain extent, the economy will inevitably fall into a state of stagnation.

<h3 id="e26">Minister Lin Xuan Attends Citizens' Assembly in Yingcheng <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Hankou, 12th (Central News Agency) – Central Government Special Envoy and Minister of Propaganda Lin Tuosheng flew to Yingcheng County yesterday morning (11th) to participate in the citizens' demonstration assembly held in the county. Accompanying him were Hubei Provincial Governor Yang, Secretary-Director of the East Asia League Branch Cai Wenshi, and Councilor Zhong Renshou. The whole county was filled with a warm and tense atmosphere. Minister Lin gave an earnest and profound instruction to the citizens present at the assembly, stating in essence, "The British and American imperialists are obstacles to peace, and Chiang Kai-shek is a traitor to East Asia and China, obstructing our work for peace. Now we must eliminate the obstacles to peace. First of all, we should defeat the enemy and destroy the British and Americans. We recall the past, when Chiang Kai-shek lost the territory, he did not consider it China's territory. When he abandoned his compatriots, he did not consider them China's compatriots. At that time, we had no country, no government, and no leader, until after the return of the National Government under the leadership of Chairman Wang, we knew that we still had a country, still had a government, and we could see the national flag with the blue sky, white sun, and a wholly red earth." He continued, "Now the National Government and friendly nations, with the determination to live and die together, have resolutely joined the Greater East Asia War. As for the responsibilities we bear after joining, they are even greater. In this year, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have been eliminated. The soldiers of friendly nations are shedding blood on the front lines, and the people of friendly nations are sweating in the rear. We ask ourselves, we have not shed blood or sweat, so at least we should ensure security in the rear and strive for production. Each of us has inherent strength. As long as we have two hands and one leg, and are willing to work hard, we can shoulder the mission of restoring China and defending East Asia." The audience was inspired. After the meeting, Minister Lin and others went to the military headquarters for lunch. At around 12:00 noon, Minister Lin and others returned to Hankou by the same plane.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Establishing the Culture of Greater East Asia <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Beijing Special Telegram: The cultural whirlwind stirred up by the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War will inevitably cause the Chinese in North China to rise up and pay attention to the Renaissance of Greater East Asia, thus becoming the foundation of this movement. Since the China Incident, North China's culture has been in a state of stagnation, with most Chinese cultural figures hiding in the mire of this cultural sedimentation. It was not until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War that a reaction began to occur. However, compared to them, the local Japanese still maintain their old ways. The color of fixed pacification is still strong, which cannot but be considered a regrettable thing. This cultural stagnation is due to the antiquated way of thinking (colonial perspective) of the Japanese in the area. Such a situation can be seen everywhere. Excessive caution has led to a lack of coherence and unity in cultural work, making it impossible to establish solid cultural countermeasures. Today, we long to establish a new cultural theory, a desire that may not be unreasonable in these extraordinary times. The so-called Renaissance, the so-called cultural innovation, needless to say, are all advancing toward the magnificent goal of completing the Greater East Asia War. China's participation in the war has made the 100 million people of North China even more aware of this goal. Currently, a million students have been mobilized in North China to work diligently to increase food production, becoming a powerful arm in support of the National Government's participation in the war, embarking on a new stage. The New National Movement is rapidly unfolding in North China's education circles, and the atmosphere is changing the face of North China. The leaders of the movement, in order to grasp this principle and use it as a source of strengthening, should constantly instill new cultural ideas. How can Sino-Japanese cooperation and Sino-Japanese cultural exchange become constituent elements of a new culture? This depends on how to integrate the minds of the Chinese and Japanese people and inject new strength. When observing the current situation of North China's culture using this method, the activities centered on the Beijing Music Culture Association are quite active. A new concert hall is being built in the Central Park of Beijing. At the same time, Mr. Kōsak Yamada came to Beijing last winter. His compositions include "Forbidden City," and the unfinished "Temple of Heaven," which are quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>The North China Writers Association, which was born last autumn, is the only organization for Chinese writers. After its establishment, the association immediately dispatched its writers to inspect and lecture in rural areas throughout North China, striving to create new forms. Most of the North China representatives to the Second Greater East Asia Literary Conference were also selected by the association. In terms of theater, the situation is quite pessimistic. Opinions on the establishment of public theaters are extremely complex and divergent. Each theater troupe has to reform its organization on its own. There is a great shortage of suitable talents, which is also worrying. However, the fact that theater has not deviated from reality may be one of the gratifying phenomena that will lead to new opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>The character of North China's culture is constantly being renewed, and a new atmosphere is sprouting. The 400,000 Japanese residents in North China, influenced by this trend, should not forget their responsibilities for a moment. The core of this responsibility can be summarized in the phrase "fully understand the Chinese people." Without fully understanding the Chinese people, it is impossible to fully grasp Chinese thought. We should, of course, share the task of reforming North China's culture. In order to establish the culture of Greater East Asia and complete the Greater East Asia War, we must now fight with all our strength.

<h3 id="e28">Japanese Medical and Pharmaceutical Enterprises in China: The History of the Hankou Dojinkai <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou Special Telegram) The footprints of the Dojinkai's medical treatment and epidemic prevention team have spread to all parts of China, saving countless lives. Not only Japanese residents, but also the Chinese people have benefited greatly. This article discusses the glorious achievements of the Hankou Dojinkai's medical treatment and epidemic prevention team over the past 20 years. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Hankou Dojinkai. Its sincere efforts and great contributions are worth introducing to readers.</p>
<p>In October of the 8th year of the Taisho era, preparations were made to establish the Dojinkai on Yamasaki Street in the Japanese Concession of Hankou. After five years of painstaking planning, it was officially established in January of the 12th year of the Taisho era. It had seven doctors, fifteen female nurses, and six clerks. The scale was not very large, and there were inconveniences due to the unfamiliar climate and diet. There was heavy pressure from anti-Japanese and insulting-Japanese sentiments. Dr. Takeo Ishikawa, the first director of the hospital, struggled and worked hard in this difficult environment in order to achieve the intended purpose. In December of the 15th year of the Taisho era, Dr. Kazumasa Takeichi took over as the second director of the hospital. At this time, the situation between China and Japan became even more complex and delicate. However, the Dojinkai continued to work hard to protect the health of the people and promote friendship between the two countries. In April of the 2nd year of the Showa era, the April 3rd Incident occurred. In July of the 6th year of the Showa era, the Yangtze River flood occurred, and rioters emerged in the city. The Dojinkai worked tirelessly to provide rescue and medical treatment, day and night for two months, benefiting the Chinese people greatly. Unfortunately, in July of the 12th year of the Showa era, war broke out between China and Japan. On August 7th of the same year, the Dojinkai had to retreat due to circumstances.</p>
<p>The Tokyo headquarters of the Dojinkai, in view of the expansion of the incident, temporarily organized a medical treatment and rescue team, led by Chief Takeichi, which departed for Tianjin on October 14th. It began mobile medical treatment in the Tianjin area for three months, going deep into remote villages, passing through more than 50 places. At the same time, a team led by Nakajima engaged in medical treatment and epidemic prevention work in Jinan. On June 5th of the 13th year of the Showa era, they transferred to Shanghai. Before they could catch their breath, they started working, and opened a clinic in Hangzhou. In late September, the leader was changed, and the new leader, Gozo Nakajima, led the team, concentrating in Shanghai, waiting for the news of the fall of Wuhan. After the gunpowder smoke in Wuhan gradually dissipated, a team arrived in Hankou on November 3rd, temporarily opening a clinic inside the military special service department. On November 5th, all the members of the medical treatment and rescue team arrived in Hankou and began to take active action.</p>
<p>In August of the 15th year of the Showa era, Gozo Nakajima resigned, and Dr. Tatsuo Naito succeeded him as the team leader. In May of the 17th year, he was transferred again, and Dr. Hideo Kuraoka succeeded him. Five team leaders have been transferred successively, and the name has been changed three times. Initially, it was the Dojinkai Hankou Hospital, then it was renamed the Dojinkai Hankou Clinic, and now it is called the Dojinkai Medical Treatment and Epidemic Prevention Team. There are fifteen doctors, twenty-four Japanese female nurses, twenty-five Chinese female nurses, three technicians, four technical assistants, seven clerks, five sanitation workers, and forty-five Chinese employees. The average daily outpatient visits are 300, half of whom are Chinese.</p>
<p>The work of the Dojinkai Hankou Medical Treatment and Epidemic Prevention Team is very extensive. Various vaccinations are provided. Hankou is a place where cholera is rampant. Now that there is the Dojinkai, cholera can be eliminated. Its duties are of utmost importance. In addition, the Hubei Provincial Government's health personnel training course is also entrusted to the Dojinkai for assistance, and 180 students have graduated. The affiliated Chinese female nurse school has been running for four years since the 14th year of the Showa era, and ten female nurses graduate each year. At the same time, it also undertakes the work of training medical assistants entrusted by military authorities and county governments. In addition, mobile medical teams will be sent to Yichang and other villages without doctors to provide medical treatment, divided into five teams, totaling more than 100 people. This kind of work makes a great contribution to popularizing Japanese medicine and reassuring the Chinese people. In the needs of the times, the mission of the Dojinkai is becoming more and more important day by day. (Ren: Translated from the January 29th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3 id="e29">Germany Adopts Special Strategy; Soviet Offensive Weakens; Major Battle Reported Near Kharkov and Rostov <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 12th [Day, Month Omitted] Huitong News Agency Telegram: Today's German war report stated that, due to repeated heavy blows, the strength of the Soviet army's attacks on German positions yesterday has weakened. However, the German defense forces are becoming stronger with each battle. The Soviets claimed yesterday that they attempted to sneak into Novorossiysk using ships, but failed. The Soviets attempted to attack the flanks of our army in the Kupyansk area, but were repelled with heavy losses. In the past two days, the Soviets have lost a total of 1,700 men in that area, and 850 have been captured, along with 35 large guns and many other infantry weapons. In the Donets area and west of Oskol, the Soviet offensive is not as strong as in the past few days. The Soviet advance north of Kursk was repelled with heavy losses by the defending forces. The Soviet offensive on Luki was also repelled. Continuous Soviet offensives in Volkhov, Lake Ladoga, and Leningrad have also failed, with a total of 53 enemy tanks destroyed and many enemy soldiers captured. German aircraft also shot down 29 enemy aircraft in the air, with a loss of 3 German aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th [Day, Month Omitted] Huitong News Agency Telegram: It was learned here today that the special strategy adopted by the German army in the southern sector of the Eastern Front is uniquely characterized by the fact that the defending forces in certain segments are composed of German and Hungarian rifle units, which resist the fierce Soviet attacks like a breakwater. The defending forces hold a key point along a river. The Soviet offensive forces are extremely strong, advancing wave after wave, attacking from all sides for several days. The defending forces calmly fought back, and the enemy was never able to break through their defended positions, and they safely shifted their positions westward. The result of this battle was the destruction of 23 enemy tanks, the shooting down of 2 enemy aircraft, and the elimination of more than half of two enemy brigades.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 12th [Day, Month Omitted] Domei News Agency Telegram: A major battle is taking place near the two major cities of Kharkov and Rostov in southern Russia. Soviet troops are attempting to encircle the two cities, but have not yet succeeded. A Moscow communiqué last night admitted that the puppet army has formed an "iron wall" around Rostov. German sources say that the Soviet army is attacking Kharkov with great force, and the offensive will be further strengthened in the coming days. Reports from the front in Moscow say that both Rostov and Kharkov are being heavily bombarded by Red Army artillery.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th [Day, Month Omitted] Huitong News Agency Telegram: Military officials here say that the Soviet army on the Eastern Front lost no less than 40 tanks the day before yesterday. The General Army's motorized units and tank units, in the lower Don River and northern Donets basins, repelled Soviet infantry and tank units, destroying 6 tanks and 10 anti-tank guns. German tanks elsewhere charged into a factory area, destroying 3 Soviet tanks and 8 anti-tank guns. The German army destroyed 23 enemy tanks in the lower Don River. Enemy infantry and tank units were reinforced in the upper Donets River. The German army counterattacked, encircling a Soviet division, destroying 2 fortresses, 3 tanks and 6 artillery pieces.</p>
<p>Central Donets Heavy Snow; Only Mobile Warfare on Both Sides</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th/12th [Days, Month Omitted] Huitong News Agency Telegram: For a week, the Soviet army has been attacking desperately in the central Donets area, but without success. The Soviet goal is to encircle the German army in Rostov, or force it to quickly retreat to the lower Dnieper River. However, due to the strong German resistance, the Soviet attempt was unsuccessful and they had to change their plan and attack west and southwest. A large German force launched a counterattack in the northwest of the Donets basin on February 9. Although the enemy resisted fiercely, the German army still advanced steadily. The vanguard of the Soviet advance south has been cut off from its communication. On the front line from the central Donets to the north of Kursk, it is snowing heavily, so there is only mobile warfare on both sides. The German defenses there have been greatly strengthened in the past two days. The Soviet offensive northwest of Kursk failed and suffered heavy losses. The German army launched counterattacks at other points in the south, encircling and annihilating several Soviet units. The enemy's reports of the occupation of Volchansk and other cities in the Kharkov area are not true. The enemy's pressure on Kharkov is very strong. The situation in the Donets River and lower Don River has not changed. The Soviet army advancing along the Sea of Azov encountered a fierce attack from the German bridgehead fortifications. It is difficult for the Soviet army there to cooperate effectively with the Soviet landing forces northwest of Novorossiysk. The Soviet offensive on Lake Ladoga has expanded to the west of Leningrad and the Volkhov area, but this only serves to disperse Soviet forces. The fighting in the Luga area is limited to local actions.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 12th [Day, Month Omitted] Central News Agency Telegram: According to Eastern Front sources received here, the German offensive in the middle reaches of the Donets River became increasingly fierce by the 11th [Day, Month Omitted]. The German army in the Kramatorskaya area has completely stopped the Soviet southward offensive and launched a fierce counterattack, penetrating deep into Soviet positions and capturing a strategic high ground. The initiative in the war has gradually been grasped by the German army. The German defense line on the north bank of the mouth of the Don River is extremely solid and is currently bombarding the Soviet army on the opposite bank with heavy artillery. The Soviet army attempted to advance northward from the port of Azov on the morning of the 11th [Day, Month Omitted], but was repelled by the German army. At the same time, the war situation in the Kharkov area is also becoming increasingly urgent. The two armies are currently engaged in fierce fighting in heavy snow. The Soviet Information Bureau's communiqué on the 11th [Day, Month Omitted] stated that the Soviet army had advanced to the area of Tikhohuyeve, 22 kilometers southeast of Kharkov, and Sertian'ske, 36 kilometers northeast of the city, and is currently pressing on Kharkov from both the north and south. However, according to German frontline sources, the German army has repelled the Soviet army to the east and is launching encirclements of considerable scale at several locations.</p>

<p>Berlin, 12th [Day, Month Omitted] Huitong News Agency Telegram: German Economics Minister Funk, in his capacity as President of the German Reichsbank, stated in a speech at the bank's annual meeting today that Germany has now drafted new measures to absorb unused purchasing power. Germany is now mobilizing the country's economic forces to engage in total war, so it will increase taxes, but the types and scope of the increase will not be announced for the time being. Regarding Germany's debt to European countries under the clearing system, there is no need to worry, because Germany's production capacity has greatly increased, and the economic resources in the occupied areas have also been developed, so the industrial production power is extremely large, and the debt can be repaid as soon as possible. Moreover, the installment loans owed to Germany by various countries are all long-term, so they can also offset part of it. As for the raw materials imported by Germany, they are all paid for in cash, so the loans owed by Germany to various countries are reliable, and in terms of clearing income and expenditure, Germany's foreign debt is not very large. Because European countries have failed to take the same measures as Germany, their prices have not stabilized, so Germany has to purchase their raw materials at high prices. On the contrary, German prices are almost the same as when the war broke out, so its export trade is very good.</p>

An American reconnaissance team in Tunisia attacked Axis positions and engaged in battle with the Axis forces. The Americans suffered heavy losses. In northern Tunisia, enemy forces attacked the outskirts of the Atlas Mountains, but were repelled by the Axis forces. Torrential rain fell everywhere in Tunisia, so the fighting was limited to minor clashes.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 11th [Day, Month Omitted] Havas News Agency Telegram: According to reports from both the Axis and Anglo-American sides, the Tunisian front was still quiet today. The reason for this is partly due to the bad weather, and partly due to the fact that the Anglo-American Allied forces have not yet been able to bring in reinforcements and supplies.</p>
<p>Vichy, 12th [Day, Month Omitted] Huitong News Agency Telegram: The French Information Bureau announced that General Giraud's troops have withdrawn from the Tunisian border.

<p>Berlin, 12th [Day, Month Omitted] Huitong News Agency Telegram: War correspondent Frank stated that Admiral Dönitz took command of the submarine "U-250" on September 27, 1935, marking the beginning of his career in submarine warfare. When the war broke out in 1939, he served as commander of the German First Submarine Flotilla, commanding 40 submarines, venturing into the deep ocean to carry out activities. His officers and men were well-trained, so their war record was outstanding. After Dönitz took office as German Navy Minister, he told the reporter, "I will devote all naval strength to submarine warfare."</p>
<h3 id="e38">British Prime Minister's Report on the North African Situation: Stating a Major War is Still Needed; Axis Forces in Tunisia Should Not Be Overlooked; He Will Meet Roosevelt Again in the Next Nine Months <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Allied News Agency) British Prime Minister Churchill reported on the military situation in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that a very serious war is still needed in Africa. Adding the operational plan decided at the Casablanca Conference, the Allied nations must fight against the Axis powers in a very large scope and as early as possible in the land, sea, and air. Victory is not easily achieved. The losses suffered by our side at sea are extremely significant, hindering our full-scale operations and prolonging the war. The Axis forces in Tunisia still number 300,000, and the future is difficult. The Allied nations should not overlook this. The German army caused extensive damage in Tripoli, greatly impacting our supplies from the Mediterranean. Although our army can still advance, the Axis powers may have had time to consolidate their positions and continue reinforcements. On the Allied side, U.S. General Eisenhower is the Supreme Commander of the British and American forces in North Africa, which is beneficial for military operations. It is hoped that the people will not criticize him. Although there are some dissatisfactions, it is hoped that one general will not be used against another to create discord.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Haitong News Agency) According to news from London, British Prime Minister Churchill officially stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the position of the British Eighth Army in North Africa is very important. The halt in the fighting on the border between Tripoli and Tunisia is due to supply difficulties, as the Axis forces destroyed the harbor facilities when they withdrew from the port of Tripoli.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) According to reports from London, Churchill reported on his recent diplomatic activities, such as the meeting in Casablanca, in the British House of Commons on the 11th. In this report, he still expressed optimism about the anti-Axis military situation. At that time, he first gave a brief report on the war situation, boasting that the anti-Axis countries had dispatched 500,000 troops to the African front and could launch a major offensive against the Axis forces within the next nine months to cover up the current setbacks in the anti-Axis military operations. He then explained the reorganization of the anti-Axis command and then reported on the meeting process, saying that the plan to launch an offensive against the Axis forces with sea, land, and air forces had been decided at the Casablanca meeting. However, when he described the threat of anti-Axis submarines, he revealed the distress of the British and American sides, saying that the threat of submarines is still profound. Finally, Churchill also revealed his lack of confidence in future operations, saying that in the next nine months, I will meet with Roosevelt again to make agreements.</p>
<p>U.S. Troops Participate in the North African Offensive</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Haitong News Agency) U.S. Secretary of War Stimson gave a speech in Washington yesterday, stating that U.S. troops have begun to participate in the Tunisian offensive, and a major battle will occur in the near future. Stimson expressed joy and welcomed General Eisenhower's appointment as the Allied Supreme Commander in North Africa, viewing it as a prelude to the start of a new offensive.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) According to reports from London, British Prime Minister Churchill announced the new lineup of the anti-Axis military headquarters in North Africa in the British House of Commons on the 11th: 1. Lieutenant General Eisenhower (U.S.), Supreme Commander of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa; 2. General Alexander (British), Deputy Supreme Commander of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa; 3. Lieutenant General Tedder (British), Commander of the anti-Axis air force in the Mediterranean theater. In addition, because Lieutenant General Tedder is still under the command of Eisenhower, the anti-Axis air force throughout Central Asia is expected to be under his command. Stockholm, 12th (Haitong News Agency) British Prime Minister Churchill announced that General Tedder has been appointed Commander of the British Air Force in the Mediterranean region and will command the air combat of the British 1st and 8th Armies on the Tunisian front. Air Marshal Coningham is also under the command of Tedder. Admiral Cunningham is responsible for commanding naval battles in the Mediterranean. Admiral Harwood, the current Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, has been transferred to Commander-in-Chief of the Near East, including the Red Sea region.</p>
<p>Eisenhower Promoted to General</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Haitong News Agency) Washington news: President Roosevelt has ordered the promotion of Lieutenant General Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in North Africa, to the rank of General.</p>
<p>Tangier, 12th New appointed Deputy Commander of the Allied Forces in North Africa, General Alexander, arrived in Algiers with several followers and will hold consultations with Supreme Commander General Eisenhower.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 11th (Havas News Agency) After being appointed Deputy Commander of the Allied Forces in the North African theater, General Alexander, Commander of the British forces in the Middle East, told the press today, "General Rommel will retreat to the Mareth Line. This line stretches from the Mediterranean Sea, across the desert, to the salt lake area of southern Tunisia, a total length of forty miles. If this line is broken by our army, General Rommel will likely deploy near the city of Gabes. This area has many salt lakes and is close to the coast, with a harsh climate, which is quite unfavorable for the British army. Previously, there were continuous heavy rains, which were unfavorable for the attacking side." In addition, British officers and soldiers who apply for leave to return home must wait until Mediterranean transportation resumes before approval, as it is currently impossible to transport officers and soldiers on leave to return home via the southern tip of Africa.</p>
<p>Capture of Palembang</p>
<h3 id="e39">An Inspection Record of the First Anniversary of the Battle <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The paratrooper unit, known as the "Flower of the Army Air Force," suddenly landed in Palembang, a strategic point in southern Sumatra, on February 14th of last year and immediately occupied it. The whole world was shocked by this great victory. It was the 69th day after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and a year has passed in an instant. Thanks to the kindness of the local air force unit, the reporter took a military plane to visit Palembang and was able to catch a glimpse of the majestic appearance of the Japanese Army paratrooper unit, which is still shrouded in secrecy, and to conduct a detailed inspection of this historic battle site. At the same time, with the help of the local officers and soldiers, I went deep into the jungle area and visited the plane from which Commander Kume, who commanded the paratrooper landing at the time, descended.</p>
<p>Looking down from the sky over Sumatra, the vast forest resembles a vast dark green velvet carpet. Flying through the milky white clouds, the misty rain is ahead, and showers fall from time to time. The turbid flow of the Musi River is instantly in sight. The large formation of our paratrooper unit at the time also used this Musi River as a landmark, landing in the enemy's formation from the sudden downpour. The city of Palembang appears on the right side of the plane, and the plane makes a large circling flight, landing at the airfield before 4 p.m.</p>
<p>On this day, I was very fortunate to meet two officers who had a particularly close relationship with the paratrooper unit in Palembang. One was Lieutenant Colonel Nonaka, the author of a recently published book on the Army Paratrooper Unit, and the other was Commander Nishi, a squad leader at the airfield who had engaged in a desperate struggle here a year ago and was awarded a Medal of Honor. The reporter first climbed the command tower where the Japanese flag was first raised and heard about the situation at the time of the occupation from Commander Nishi.</p>
<p>Remains of the Commando's Fierce Battles</p>
<p>In the Palembang capture operation, a memorial monument has been built for the brave warriors who sacrificed their lives for the country. It is inscribed with the still fresh words "Site of the Commando's Departure for Battle." In front of the graves of Lieutenant Kiyoji Gamo, a poet, and several other brave warriors, there are eternally green "Warrior Pines." Lieutenant Colonel Nonaka presented a copy of his book "Army Paratrooper Units" at the grave of this poet lieutenant, and Commander Nishi composed a poem and dedicated it to the grave of the brave warrior:</p>
<p>Has it been a year? Presenting a bouquet of wildflowers,</p>
<p>Visiting the grave of the brave warrior.</p>
<p>The next story,</p>
<p>Like the flow of the Musi River,</p>
<p>Remains unchanged forever.</p>
<p>Young locals are opening up roads in the jungles near the streets. They are working hard every day to build new roads and new houses. The eastern and western city of Palembang is now one of the driving forces for completing the Greater East Asia War, taking on a glorious new mission. The fact that this achievement was achieved in less than a year is due to the extraordinary merits of the Army Paratrooper Unit. Thanks to the paratrooper unit, we recognized the significance of the Palembang capture operation, and at the same time, the brilliance of their military achievements is deeply engraved in our hearts.</p>
<p>Before the war, before the United States banned oil exports to Japan, a lot of oil from Palembang was imported to Japan. The oil shipped to Japan was refined in a separate facility, and the quality was poor and the price was high. In the Palembang capture operation, the mission of the paratrooper unit was to use a surprise attack to seize the enemy's position and hold it until the ground troops arrived to relieve them. At the same time, Palembang was also a powerful forward base for the Japanese air force in the Java capture operation, from which they launched their attack and subdued Java.</p>
<p>The first attack on Palembang was on February 6th, with the Army aircraft led by the Endo Unit. Since the end of January, they had gradually chased down enemy aircraft fleeing from Malaya and destroyed 19 aircraft in one fell swoop. After that, they continued to attack on the 7th, 8th, and 13th, during which they shot down a total of 77 warplanes, and a portion of the enemy's air force was dealt a devastating blow.</p>
<p>February 14th of Last Year</p>
<p>On the 14th, a large formation of paratrooper units that took off from the Malaya base flew long distances to Sumatra, protected by fighter-bombers. One unit landed in the southern and western areas of the Palembang airfield at 11:26 a.m., and another unit landed three minutes later in the southern area of the oil refinery. At the same time, the plane of Commander Kume, the commander of the commando unit, landed in a desolate jungle swamp about ten kilometers southwest of the airfield. All the ground weapons started firing at once, but no Japanese soldiers were hit or injured, and the entire army landed safely.</p>
<p>In the landing area, there were dense thickets of weeds over ten feet tall. Commander Kume was forced to land in a forest swamp where the mud was up to his chest. Naturally, he could not make contact with the unit in one day, so he began a bitter struggle, with each man fighting for himself. Every officer was both a commander, a scout, and a soldier—with only the remaining weapons? With just their bodies, hand grenades and pistols, they fought like one against a thousand. Lieutenant Gamo single-handedly captured an enemy anti-aircraft gun position and eventually died in battle. The heroic battle situations of Lieutenant Okumoto, Lieutenant Tokunaga, Commander Hirose, and others were already spread in the news at the time. The Nishi unit, which had been flying along the Musi River, also arrived at the airfield and began to become active. In this way, the oil refinery and the airfield were both taken by the Japanese army in one day, and the oil refinery, which was originally thought to have been destroyed, was also undamaged and occupied by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Searching for the Kume Plane</p>
<p>The next day, the reporter engaged in searching for Commander Kume's plane, which had been forced to land in the forest area. We set off in the early morning dawn of Sumatra's great nature in a truck, a group of eight people including Lieutenant Suzuki, five soldiers, a translator Takenaka, and the reporter. The truck could not pass outside the city, so we abandoned the car and walked into a village adjacent to the road. But no one could remember the location of the plane's landing. The sun under the scorching equator was pressing down on our whole bodies. We advanced through the back roads, and a small plane flew over our heads. The pilot was Sergeant Kimura, who had shot down the first enemy plane at the Nomonhan Incident. He dropped two communication cylinders in a lively low-altitude flight and flew to the front several times and returned, so we were able to roughly find out the location of the plane, but there was no way to advance, so we stopped the morning search and waited for the results of Sergeant Kimura's reconnaissance.</p>
<p>This time, Sergeant Kimura set off alone, and our group entered the forest area again. After 5 p.m., we had not yet found it. The search for this day was declared hopeless and reported to Commander 〇〇. The reporter immediately returned to Palembang to wait for a few days before searching again.</p>
<p>The reporter previously visited the area with Major Tanaka in a small plane that he piloted and found this historically significant landing plane within a few minutes. The milky white fuselage was brightly lit by the sun on the rudder, shining the conspicuous symbol of the landing paratrooper unit. The next day, the reporter again received the kindness of the unit, hiring ten local workers, Lieutenant Eto, and more than ten people in total, departed at 9:00 a.m. After two hours, guided by the local natives, we walked out of the swampy area of the forest. In front of us was a small river, and by chance, there was a small boat that could only hold three people and was half broken, barely crossing the river in two waves.</p>
<p>Finding the Fuselage</p>
<p>About forty minutes close to the destination, a residence appeared. We shouted from afar, but there was no answer. The owner of the boat seemed to be the owner of the house. We used a small ladder to climb to the high point of the residence and looked around. In the forest area a hundred and ten meters ahead, there seemed to be long things lying horizontally there. When Lieutenant Eto looked through the binoculars, it was exactly the landing plane we were searching for. We couldn't help but shout "Banzai," cleared the thorns, and entered the scene. Looking at the watch in my arms, it was exactly noon.</p>
<p>The plane seemed to have made a left turn and come to rest facing south, still in the same state as it was when it landed a year ago, without any changes. We sat on the wing of the plane and talked about the tragic spirit of Commander Kume's men a year ago. The first anniversary of the paratrooper landing has become a landmark page in the history of Japanese air warfare. We want to inform the people of the country about the intactness of Commander Kume's plane. The local unit is currently keeping this memorable plane in its original location, building fences around it to preserve this eternally immortal battle site. Palembang, Yoshida dispatched staff. 翔: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, February 6th</p>

Our reporter inquired with the Cooperative yesterday and learned that the total amount of sugar registered in various warehouses of the Cooperative is 200,000 bags. Recently, the authorities shipped 100,000 bags of Taiwan sugar, so the total amount of sugar stored in Shanghai is over 300,000 bags, which is sufficient to maintain long-term supply and will not lead to a shortage panic.</p>
<p>Approval of This Month's Sugar Allotment</p>
<p>Regarding the sugar allotment quantity for February, it has been approved by the Cooperative after submitting it to the military authorities for review at 25,000 bags. After obtaining a movement permit, it will be handled in advance and distributed to each retail merchant and various industrial users. (1) The allotment quantity for each retail merchant is calculated based on the registered amount ratio and will be issued with a sugar collection certificate starting from the 18th of this month. After paying the full amount, the sugar will be collected from the designated sugar store and sold in accordance with the Cooperative's regulations. (2) Special allotments for various industrial users will be approved based on the proper needs of each applicant. However, the sugar of this type of allotment can only be used for self-use and must never be transferred for other purposes. Violators will be permanently disqualified from the right to receive an allotment.</p>
<p>Pilot Program for Distributing Sugar by Headcount in the Southern City</p>
<p>After approval by the military authorities for allotting sugar by headcount in accordance with the Baojia system, it has been decided to implement the detailed rules and simple drafts for allotting sugar by headcount, starting in the Southern City area. Each Fang and Baojia in the district has already completed the preliminary compilation of household registration books. Therefore, the Cooperative will issue sugar purchase certificates before the 20th of this month, based on the preliminary household registration books, to pilot the distribution of sugar by headcount. It is said that each person is temporarily allotted half a catty (approximately 0.66 lbs) based on the "Tianping" scale. It is estimated that the Southern City area has a population of 400,000, requiring approximately 200,000 catties of sugar. As for the exact allotment quantity and price, the Cooperative will publish it in the newspaper at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Japanese Spokesperson Talks About Anglo-American Relations <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, 本　reporting, Lieutenant Matsuda, Deputy Spokesperson of the Japanese Army, stated yesterday when meeting with foreign journalists that regarding the French North African issue, the relationship between Britain and the United States remains tense. The reason for this is not only that the United States considers itself the master in North Africa, but also because Britain's post-war policy does not allow the United States to strengthen its position in North Africa. The US and the UK are backing General Giraud and Admiral Darlan respectively, it is clear that the aims of the US and the UK in North Africa are in conflict. The US called the North African campaign a holy war. Roosevelt once said that the campaign was for the sake of the peace and freedom and salvation of France; however, the US supported the Darlan regime whilst the British opposed this, further demonstrating the dispute between the US and the UK. In other words, the Giraud party is merely a tool of the British, whereas the US has seized control of the Darlan party’s regime. As for Giraud, he ignores the interests of the country and the people, simply seeking to control the regime in order to satisfy his own selfish desires. Finally, the British and Americans realised that they must win over both the Giraud party and the Darlan party in order to seek reconciliation. Churchill and Roosevelt both said that the meeting between the two French rebel leaders had yielded good results, but we have reliable information that this is not the case; Giraud’s demands, such as implementing the laws of the French Republic in Algeria and Morocco, and removing officials who had cooperated with the Vichy government, were not accepted by Darlan. It will take a long time to resolve this dispute, because Britain does not want the US to establish control in the Mediterranean. If Britain were to make concessions and support the Giraud regime, then this would demonstrate that Britain has become subservient to the US, and that the interests of the Giraud party would be sacrificed by the British.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Opinions on Improving Order at the North Station <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Cang</p>
<p>First</p>
<p>Some time ago, Shen Bao published an article hoping that the China Railway Company would improve the order at the entrance of the North Station, which was very pertinent. A few days ago, I went to Wuxi and planned to take the 4 p.m. Tianma train. When I arrived at the North Station before 3 p.m., it was already a sea of people. The line extended to Baoshan Road. Some people had their luggage on their heads, some had their luggage on their backs or hanging in front of their chests, some were carrying children in one hand and luggage in the other, and some were empty-handed without luggage. Everyone was scrambling and shouting. Those who have not experienced this chaos firsthand cannot imagine it. I stood there for half an hour and still hadn't moved an inch. I went to the entrance of the wooden shed to see what was going on, and found that many passengers could pay 20 or 30 yuan to so-called "heavenly guides" who would find ways to squeeze them into the front of the line, causing those at the back of the line to be forever left behind. Fortunately, it didn't rain. If it had rained, it would have been even worse. It wasn't until 4:15 p.m. that I was inspected and allowed to enter the station, but the 4 p.m. Tianma train had already left. The suffering of travelers could not be greater. I hope the authorities will consider the passengers and open more convenient channels. I respectfully submit the following two points for improvement as far as my humble opinion can see:</p>
<p>(1) The wooden shed at the entrance should be widened and more inspection lanes should be added, which would greatly reduce congestion.</p>
<p>(2) Passengers without luggage can enter the station through the main entrance after inspection, which would improve order.</p>
<p>Second</p>
<p>(1) Request the military police at the North Station to divide passengers entering the station into those with luggage and those with light belongings.</p>
<p>(2) Whether carrying luggage or empty-handed, all passengers must be arranged in single lines to move forward to the original wooden shed passage. The passengers would rather endure a long wait outside the shed than suffer the pain of being crowded and unable to breathe.</p>
<p>(3) Request the military police to start the search earlier so that the elderly, weak, women, and children can reduce the suffering of standing for a long time. (Ni Jiayou)</p>
<p>Third</p>
<p>Request the authorities: (1) Strictly prevent extortion. Send plainclothes detectives to secretly investigate. If any extortion is found, punish the perpetrators to deter others. (2) Maintain strict order. Line up in order and enter in a single file. Strictly prohibit violence and squeezing. It is best to separate women, children, the elderly, and the young and strong. Set up more awnings and set a fixed number of people so that passengers do not suffer from excessive waiting or exposure to rain. As for the inspection, I hope that those responsible for the inspection will not throw the passengers' belongings around to avoid loss. It is best to check them as they arrive, which can reduce the disorder. Be as lenient as possible with luggage and clothing so that those returning home do not suffer the pain of losing their belongings. (3) Increase the number of trains. There are more passengers than before, but fewer trains than before, which is one of the reasons for the disorder. Please increase the number of trains and passenger cars as much as possible. Also, set up information counters in conspicuous places to provide guidance and prevent passengers from missing their trains. Trains are supposed to be a business of transportation, but most people see them as a daunting experience, which is not appropriate. (Hua Qiuguo)</p>
<p>Fourth</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Bai Hong's suggestions for improving the order at the entrance of the North Station, I believe that one cannot fully understand the situation without experiencing it firsthand. As Mr. Bai said: "The strong ones go first, and those who keep order are forever left behind." A few days ago, when I sent my uncle to Wuxi, I met a passenger who, because he followed the order, had not been able to enter the station for seven days, let alone board the train. If this happened to someone with money and a place to live in Shanghai, it would be okay, but what about those out-of-town passengers or those who are unemployed and returning home? What can they do? Also, if you live far from the station and have luggage, you will inevitably be exhausted and hungry from being squeezed every day, and the cost of the rickshaw back and forth will exceed the train fare to Hangzhou or Nanjing. What's more, the women, children, and elderly are really in danger of losing their lives. The reason for this is the general peddlers. Therefore, the way to improve the situation is to eliminate the peddlers. Although most peddlers are forced to do so for a living, in order to protect the real passengers, this must be done.

<h3 id="e45">Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund - List of University Students Announced - High School First Year Students Receive Funds Today - Mr. Kuzhai and Others Donate Remuneration <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The fourth Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund for first-year high school students will be distributed today, for second and third-year high school students on the 15th (Monday), and for university and business school students on the 17th. The approved list of university students is announced today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Kuzhai's Sincere Words</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Kuzhai, a well-known businessman, came to the newspaper office and generously donated his company's remuneration. He also advocated that the directors and supervisors of various companies should transfer their remuneration and transportation fees to the scholarship fund. Mr. Kuzhai has always made every effort to donate to the newspaper's scholarship fund, and his benevolent and righteous deeds are admirable. Mr. Kuzhai also attached a letter pointing out many things to the business community, with sincere words, like a benevolent person. I believe that after Mr. Kuzhai's appeal, there will be a great response. The leaders of the business community are mostly learned and will surely sympathize with this initiative and enthusiastically donate. The original letter: "To the Shen Bao, since the outbreak of the war, it has been more than five years. Shanghai is a major commercial port where various industries gather. Under the special circumstances, the business community has taken advantage of the opportunity, relying on the continuous rise in inventory prices to obtain huge profits, breaking previous records. As a result, everyone has become a fat and wealthy merchant. At the same time, there are also unfortunate people whose families and businesses have been destroyed by gunfire, or even their wives and children have been separated and their property lost. Thus, the formerly wealthy tycoons have become penniless scholars who cannot borrow money. The speed and disparity of the reversal are rare. Although there are many rich people, it is important to know that there are countless poor people like the sands of the Ganges River. In short, the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. For example, store employees may still receive bonuses or remuneration at the end of the year, which is enough to cover their usual deficits, which is already fortunate. However, most employees' salaries not only cannot support their families, but also find it difficult to raise money for their children's education and occasional illnesses and medical expenses. As for the salaried class who teach and write, they are even more impoverished. They have no unexpected income and cannot maintain a family. Let alone other uses. Due to the pressure of life, crimes and tragedies occur frequently, and people in the society should take practical responsibility and pay attention to this. Moreover, at a time when the cost of living is increasing, the rich must think about how the poor live and how they spend their days, and they should also be considerate of the difficulties of the times and consider the poor. Therefore, doing good at the end is the spirit of mutual assistance that our compatriots should have. I have always admired the righteous deeds and benevolence of your newspaper in creating blessings for the people. In view of this, I will donate the remuneration I received from a certain company last winter, totaling 4,000 storage certificates. I also learned that Mr. Nanzhai and Mr. Hongzhai will also donate 4,000 yuan each, totaling 12,000 yuan, to your newspaper for use as a scholarship fund for the poor students. I think that among the gentlemen in our business community, there are many who have status and wealth, or who hold the position of director or supervisor in several places. The remuneration or transportation fees they receive are definitely not needed for household use. If they can reduce their personal unnecessary expenses and do good deeds, donating in various ways according to their wishes is easy and achieves two benefits. I feel that my efforts are limited and cannot fully meet my wishes. This small amount is just a start. I hope that all gentlemen in our business community will work hard in their respective positions, rise up together, enthusiastically donate, spread benevolence, and establish oneself with virtue. This is a great cause. To the Shen Bao, Kuzhai."</p>
<p>Evaluation and Review Strive for Appropriateness</p>
<p>The students applying for scholarships in this session, including elementary, middle, and high school students, all took a screening exam. The members of the Women's Annual Association and Professor Zheng conducted the evaluation. In addition to reviewing the exam papers, the newspaper's reviewers considered the students' academic performance and conduct at school, and focused on the students' actual family situation. For those who had applied to the newspaper in previous sessions, their grades in each session were compared. Although the consideration process was more complicated, we strived for appropriateness. This is to distinguish it from the nature of a scholarship.</p>
<p>Scholarship Standards: Poor and Excellent</p>
<p>In recent days, we have received letters from students who failed the exam, stating that due to their difficult family circumstances, they have little opportunity to study on their own because of their labor at night, and their grades are unavoidably inferior. The letters sincerely requested consideration for their poverty and leniency. The newspaper's staff repeatedly read the letters and felt it was difficult to stand idly by. However, in this situation, those who have already been investigated by the newspaper have been given assistance and published. Those who have not been investigated and are not clear will be temporarily postponed. Students should know that "poor and excellent" is the standard for scholarships. It is difficult to make great achievements if one is poor but not excellent, and it is even more inappropriate to apply for a scholarship if one is excellent but not poor. Within this scope, the newspaper will be as lenient as possible in the review and approve the scholarship. We hope that the students will improve their grades in the next term so as not to waste the small amount of assistance approved in this review.</p>
<p>Students Changing Schools Can Exchange Checks</p>
<p>We have repeatedly received letters from students who have been approved for scholarships, requesting to change the payee on the check due to changing schools. This can be done. Students who have changed schools should immediately send a written letter with proof of identity and school attendance. Come to the office the next day to return the previously issued scholarship check, and we will reissue it. In addition, if any of the students receiving assistance have already received a scholarship elsewhere, they should immediately send a letter to cancel it in order to uphold public morality.</p>

<p>Allied Press Shanghai report: According to news last night, the industrial sector is currently carrying out the merger of Hua Central Heavy Industry Companies to reduce their numbers, improve factory equipment, and centralize production. It has been found that the heavy industry sector has recently formed a group to control the production of military equipment, shipbuilding, and other important industries, and is responsible for allocating important materials and centralizing the increase in output, etc. Those included in the merger plan include the Continental Heavy Industry Company, Shanghai Industrial Company, Asia Steel Plant, and Toyota Machine Factory. Several Japanese factories in Shanghai have already merged.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Suppressing the Rising Trend of Daily Necessities - Notifying Various Industries to Submit Forms and Reports - The Authorities Find Ways to Dredge Sources and Supply as Much as Possible - Store Employees are Jointly Responsible for Store Malpractice <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The prices of daily necessities in the two concessions, which had once tended to stabilize after the authorities implemented price limits last autumn, have risen again due to changes in wholesale and manufacturing prices. In view of this, the authorities have implemented new measures. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strictly Crack Down on High Prices</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly suppress the rising trend of daily necessities prices in the two concessions, in addition to dredging the sources and supplying as much as possible, the authorities have also notified all manufacturers and wholesalers that they must not exceed the selling prices of January 23 this year. At the same time, they are required to submit forms and reports on the sources and costs of goods before the end of this month for review and re-evaluation. As for the retail side, since the manufacturing and wholesale prices of daily necessities have not changed since January 23, the retail prices should not be increased. Therefore, the authorities will strictly crack down on retail stores that exceed the prices of January 23.</p>
<p>No Forgiveness for Stopping Sales on Pretext</p>
<p>It has also been found that some illegal stores are deliberately delaying business under various pretexts in an attempt to implement their hoarding schemes. The authorities will not forgive this. It is also heard that the authorities will implement the strictest measures against the trickery or hoarding of goods by various merchants. It is said that from now on, all employees in each store will be responsible for monitoring the store's sales activities. If anyone knows that the store is engaged in malpractice but does not report it, even if it is a small employee, they will be punished. At the same time, those who can report the inside story of the merchants will be rewarded.</p>

<p>The newly appointed Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Wu Lanxi, has completed the handover of his duties at the Municipal Food Administration. He is currently in Shanghai preparing for his trip and will leave Shanghai for Beijing to take office after a short stay. It is learned that Mr. Wu is now scheduled to leave for Beijing on the 15th of this month.</p>

<p>The serious threat to cooking oil in the city has not yet been lifted. Although the cooking oil industry wholesale office has tried its best to adjust it, the supply is not smooth. The wholesale office believes that rationing oil is imperative so that the serious situation of cooking oil can be quickly eliminated. Recently, the cooking oil in the office has been fully allocated. After more cooking oil arrives, the rationing system will be implemented. The issuance of special oil purchase certificates has also been temporarily suspended by the industry wholesale office.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Owners of Bicycles - Important Notice for Obtaining Licenses - Application Forms are Issued Separately by Territory <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>After the promulgation of the new bicycle licensing system, there was an abnormal rush to obtain application forms. However, most people did not know the jurisdiction, resulting in wasted trips. The various sections are listed below. In addition, application forms for the Public Concession will be issued throughout the day today (the 13th), until 4 p.m. Those who need to obtain them should go quickly.</p>
<p>(1) North of Suzhou Creek - 528 Mao Hai Road (Traffic and Air Defense Section Branch Office), (2) South of Suzhou Creek, 185 Fuzhou Road (Traffic and Air Defense Section Headquarters), and North of the Gehe Road Police Station (Traffic and Air Defense Section Vehicle Inspection Department). (3) French Concession - Xuhuali Road (General Motor Vehicle Office), (4) Nanshi - Xinkaihe, Minguo Road (Shanghai South Office of the Public Works Bureau), (5) Zhabei - North of the Wuzhen Road Bridge (Shanghai North Office of the Public Works Bureau).</p>
<p>(6) West Shanghai - 44 Kainar Road (Vehicle Registration Office of the Public Works Bureau).</p>
<p>Note: Car owners must obtain application forms from the competent authorities based on the location where they park their cars at night.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Vegetable Market Prices Have Not Yet Fallen - Caused by Manipulation by Intermediaries - According to a Survey of Most Chinese Business Groups' Opinions - Fixing Prices Should be Implemented Jointly in Many Ways <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "Times" reported that the Lunar New Year holiday has passed, and residents of this city have expressed deep hatred for the fact that vegetable market prices have not yet fallen. At the same time, they expressed satisfaction with the official measures taken before the Lunar New Year to control vegetable prices. It is hoped that the authorities will immediately take measures to strike at illegal merchants who repeatedly exceed the price limits.</p>
<p>Supply and Demand Tend to be Normal, Prices Have Not Fallen</p>
<p>The supply and demand in the two concessions' vegetable markets is tending to be normal. The supply of pork and vegetables remains in its original state. However, their prices have exceeded the average price by 40% to 100% when demand exceeded supply in early this month. According to observations from relevant parties, it is caused by manipulation by illegal profiteers and intermediaries. The prices of fresh meat and vegetables sold yesterday were higher than those sold half a month ago.</p>
<p>Prices in the Suburbs Have Returned</p>
<p>A "Times" reporter pointed out the rise in vegetable market prices to the vendors yesterday. According to them, the profits they make are actually less than usual. According to their explanation, when the Lunar New Year holiday ended, prices in the suburbs fell, but the intermediaries, citing "transportation difficulties", continued to raise the prices of vegetables and food. At the same time, according to Japanese newspapers, due to the severe food situation, Chinese business groups conducted a survey of Chinese opinions on the question of controlling prices. As a result, most of them said that fixing prices should not only be done unilaterally, but should also be implemented jointly in other areas.</p>

<p>In order to effectively rectify the salaries of various agencies and report them on a monthly basis, the municipal government recently issued a circular to all bureaus and departments, requiring them to comply with the regulations in the future. If the previous month's salary roster is delayed in being submitted, the unpaid portion will be temporarily deducted from the next month's regular expenses. All agencies should comply accordingly.</p>

<p>In this city, the godown and warehouse industry has been largely operated by Japanese merchants in recent years. Currently, there is already an organization called the Shanghai Japanese Warehouse Industry Association. The board of directors of the association held a meeting the other day, and in addition to discussing various routine cases, it also proposed a "motion to unite Chinese merchants in the warehouse industry to form a trade association." The motion was unanimously approved by the entire board, and each director will come forward to negotiate.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Local Authorities Actively Seek Ways to Lower the Prices of Leather Shoes - Retail, Wholesale, and Manufacturing are All Controlled <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>After the local authorities actively sought ways to lower the prices of leather shoes and the leather shoe manufacturing industry, it is now learned that a considerable number of stores are secretly raising prices in the hope of making huge profits. It is now learned that the authorities have implemented the following measures for the industry:</p>
<p>Report Prices for Review</p>
<p>In order to prevent residents from suffering excessive losses when purchasing leather shoes, the authorities of the two concessions have repeatedly sent personnel to various retail leather shoe stores to investigate prices. Those who violate the price limits will be subject to suspension or fines. Later, due to the increase in wholesale prices, the authorities focused on the wholesale and manufacturing sides. Up to now, in addition to notifying the industry that prices must not exceed those of January 23, the authorities have also ordered wholesalers and manufacturers to report their prices for review and fixation.</p>
<p>Organize Trade Associations to Handle Registration</p>
<p>In addition, in order to unify leather shoe prices and facilitate control, the leather shoe industry and the leather shoe manufacturing industry in this city have separately organized trade associations and are handling registration procedures from today. Those who delay joining will not be able to purchase leather in the future and will be stopped from applying for movement permits. Recently, the Price Control Office of the Public Works Bureau, in view of the shortage of sole leather, specifically notified the leather shoe industry that all leather shoes manufactured in the future must be changed to rubber soles in order to reduce costs.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Unified Organization of Trade Associations - Establish Distribution Department to Control Materials - Authorities Understand and Assist to Ensure Supply - Regulate Supply and Maintain Fair Distribution <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>More than 300 units of trade associations in this city that have been registered with the Public Works Bureau will form a unified function in the organization, under the control and supervision of the trade association section of the Materials Control Department, to assist the relevant authorities in implementing the established price management policies. All daily necessities necessary for citizens will be placed under the management of the allocation system to prevent hoarding and manipulation. In terms of implementation, each relevant industry association will set up a "Distribution Department" to take charge of its affairs. In addition, a pricing committee will be formed to ensure that prices do not exceed the scope of taking care of the interests of both stores and customers, following the order of manufacturing, wholesale, and retail.</p>
<p>Control Supply Sources and Regulate Supply and Demand</p>
<p>It is learned that the goods allocation system planned by the various trade associations will be managed by the "Distribution Department" set up separately in implementation, but the highest authority is in the trade association section of the Public Works Bureau and the military distribution association. Because the prerequisite for the allocation of goods is the control of the supply sources, which is difficult to achieve without the understanding and assistance of the relevant authorities. The recent allocation of soybeans and fruits and vegetables was carried out following this procedure. Now that the various industries are planning for allocation, the goods involved are limited to those related to the industry itself, and the purpose is to facilitate the affiliated stores to obtain an appropriate amount and a constant supply of goods, so as to avoid the disadvantages of unequal distribution. In this way, supply and demand will be regulated, eliminating factors that cause abnormal price changes.</p>
<p>Allocation Stores Must Meet Conditions</p>
<p>Stores that request the association to allocate goods must first formally apply and be approved by the association authorities. Stores that have obtained allocated goods must comply with the allocation rules and price limits, otherwise their allocation qualifications will be cancelled. Allocation stores must also bear the costs of the association's implementation of the allocation system. In addition, the following conditions must be met: (1) Have joined the association for more than one year, (2) Be able to bear unlimited liability economically, (3) Specialize in the commercial business related to the allocated goods without any other businesses, (4) The scope of business can affect areas outside Shanghai, (5) With the permission of the person in charge of the "Distribution Department" or the committee, stores that enjoy the right to allocation must faithfully record the transaction situation for review at any time.</p>
<p>Pricing Does Not Violate Established Policies</p>
<p>Regarding the establishment of a special committee for pricing, the Public Works Bureau has previously stipulated that the prices at which manufacturers and wholesalers sell goods in the Public Concession must not exceed the standard of the 23rd of last month, and ordered the manufacturers and wholesalers to compile the prices and cost calculations of the 23rd of last month and report them to the Materials Control Department for record. It is learned that the price limit measures will be extended from the control of manufacturing costs and wholesale prices to the evaluation of retail prices. Because retail prices cannot be controlled without the control of manufacturing and wholesale prices. The establishment of the pricing committee will be carried out by the various industry associations themselves, but the pricing standards must not be contrary to the established policies of the authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Public Works Bureau Decides to Prohibit the Shipment of Pufferfish to Shanghai - Health Department Destroys 600 Pounds <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Allied Press, Shanghai Report: The Japanese "Continental News" reported last night that the Public Works Bureau has decided to strictly prohibit the smuggling of pufferfish to Shanghai for sale, and will launch a publicity campaign to make the public aware of the danger of pufferfish poison. The motive for the authorities' move is that the number of poor citizens who have died from pufferfish poisoning is gradually increasing. Poor people, tempted by the delicious and cheap taste of pufferfish, have purchased and eaten it, but they do not know the proper cooking methods, resulting in no less than fifty people dying from poisoning recently. It has been found that the pufferfish sold in Shanghai in the past came from the sea around Jeju Island south of Korea, and were not poisonous. However, in recent months, pufferfish from the sea near Chongming Island, transported to Shanghai via Wusong Pudong, have been extremely poisonous, causing many deaths.</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's Health Department destroyed 146 pounds of pufferfish on the 9th of this month. This batch of pufferfish was confiscated from the Shanghai Fish Market and sent there. Since January 16, the Health Department has destroyed a total of 559 pounds of pufferfish.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Second Anti-Spitting Movement - From the 14th to the 20th - Fine of 5 Yuan for Spitting Anywhere <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau Information Office announced that the bureau's Health Department is scheduled to carry out the second anti-spitting movement within the concession from the 14th to the 20th of this month. The first anti-spitting movement was held in December last year and achieved considerable results in preventing spitting in various public places. The scope of the second anti-spitting movement will be extended to various roads. At that time, patrolmen and members of the duty-bound voluntary police corps will assist the Health Department staff in arresting those who spit at will. The bureau will fine such violators five yuan in accordance with Article 51 of the Land Regulations. All citizens should be careful not to spit at will to emphasize public health, which is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Ways to Lift Enemy Property Deeds: Permission to Resume Trading, With Power of Attorney for Single Mortgage <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Applications to lift enemy management orders on property deeds closed on the ninth of this month. Subsequent applications to change to Japanese or Chinese nationality will still be handled by the China Central Revitalization Real Estate Department and other agencies. Among the seven agencies handling the change of Japanese nationality, the Hengchan Company, directly under the Revitalization Real Estate Department, received the most entrusted cases, followed by Xinjiao Real Estate, Taihe Silver Company, and Dongya Xingye. The newly emerging Nomura and Yasuda Trust Companies also have a significant number. After the lifting of enemy status on property deeds, permission to resume trading has been granted, leading to an increase in new transactions compared to before. It is said that many are using power of attorney to obtain mortgage loans from banks and money shops.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Preferential Treatment for Bereaved Families of Colleagues: Qian Industry Increases Compassionate Relief Funds, Bao Feng Shun Kang Two Shops Donate to the Guild, Letter of Thanks <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Qian Industry Guild of this city previously had the organization of the Qian Industry Huai'an Society to provide preferential treatment to the bereaved families of colleagues and workers in various shops. The cost was regularly donated by various shops. A certain amount of monthly relief funds was allocated to those who were poor. They would collect it in person, greatly benefiting the poor. However, with the rise in rice and commodity prices, the cost of living is very different from the past. The amount of Huai'an relief funds received must be increased to adapt to the environment and show sincere assistance. The executive committee members of the industry guild, in view of this, decided to hold a fundraising event for Huai'an relief funds, intending to use all the donations from the various shops to increase the amount of relief funds for each recipient. It is now known that the various shops in the industry are enthusiastically assisting in this initiative, actively donating large sums of money to facilitate the decision to increase the relief funds. It is reported that Bao Feng Anji Money Shop and Shun Kang Money Shop have already sent donations for Huai'an relief funds to the guild. The guild authorities have sent letters to the two shops expressing their gratitude.</p>

<p>Regarding the supplementary registration of partnership money shops that have already started business, the Ministry of Finance has approved a deadline of one year to reorganize into a company and then re-register. The deadline is August 20th of this year. If they fail to reorganize by the deadline, they will be ordered to cease business in accordance with the law.

<p>On the morning of the 4th of this month, at around 7:30 AM, the owner of the Matsumoto Watch Shop on North Sichuan Road, his wife, and a female servant were chopped to death with an ax in their residence, and 51 watches were stolen. It is now known that, after diligent investigation by the police of the Public Works Department, the suspect, Yu Rencai (48 years old), has been arrested. It is reported that the suspect used to work as a worker at the Dahua Iron Factory in Yangshupu. He had repeatedly passed by the Matsumoto Watch Shop and noticed that only women were taking care of the shop. After inquiring, he learned that the owner was ill in bed. On the morning of the 4th, at around 7:30 AM, he broke into the shop. The shop owner's wife happened to walk out of the toilet, and the suspect immediately chopped her head with an ax, killing her. When the female servant heard the noise and came out to see, she was also chopped to the ground by the suspect. The owner, Araki, realized something was wrong and came downstairs to investigate, but was also chopped to death with an ax. The suspect stole 51 watches from the shop and fled to the Dasheng Gambling House in the South City to gamble. As a result, he lost heavily and pawned the stolen watches in nearby small pawn shops, converting them into cash. The detectives Wang Asan and Ma De learned of this, arrested him, and found 36 watches, 15 pawn tickets, and 230 yuan in cash in the suspect's home.</p>

<p>— Yun Jian Bai Jiao</p>
<p>To make up for shortcomings is the spirit of art. For example, after drinking soft wine, sometimes you have to drink a mouthful of hard wine to adjust the taste; after living in the city for a long time, sometimes you like to live in the countryside to change the air; if you are tired of the ancient writing style of the Eight Great Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties, you might as well read Wei and Jin articles!</p>
<p>However, when discussing calligraphy from a historical perspective, I think two points should be noted:</p>
<p>"Throughout the ages, calligraphy has only one path!" This is a prerequisite.</p>
<p>"Human affairs are becoming more complex, and calligraphy is becoming more convenient!" - This is a principle of the evolution of calligraphy styles.</p>
<p>Please think about it: From ancient inscriptions to large seal script, to small seal script, from small seal script to official script, from official script to chapter cursive, modern cursive, regular script, and running script, and the regular script has been stereotyped from the Han Dynasty through the Wei, Jin, and Six Dynasties to the early Tang Dynasty. Modern cursive and running script were also produced at the same time as regular script. For more than 1,700 years until now, there has been no change. I think these are enough to explain the "prerequisite."</p>
<p>Compared with seal script and official script, regular script is naturally more convenient and saves more time. In terms of application methods, of course, the more convenient the writing, the better, and the more time saved, the better. Therefore, cursive and running script were also established early on. However, cursive script is difficult to write and recognize after all. As the saying goes, "If the cursive script loses its foot, even immortals cannot guess it." Therefore, in the Han and Jin dynasties, although it was popular among the upper class, it could not be popularized for mass application. Therefore, the running script, which "has infinite daily use and has the same merit as the saints," naturally became a more widely used script in society. It can be seen that the changes in calligraphy styles throughout the dynasties were all reformed due to actual needs; at the same time, they existed and became popular due to actual needs. - The exploration of art belongs to a very small number after all. Therefore, those without practical needs - such as seal script and official script today - are only used for the appreciation of literati and scholars. - On this point, I believe it is enough to illustrate the principles of style changes.</p>
<p>Here, Wang Xizhi's being called the Sage of Calligraphy shows that it is not accidental. Needless to say, the most used scripts in society are regular script and running script; and no one denies that Wang's script is the highest achievement. It is said that the originator of the running script was Liu Desheng of Yingchuan in the late Western Han Dynasty. Later, Zhong Yao and Hu Zhao both passed on his method, and it reached its peak in Wang Xizhi. Yang Xin's discussion of Wang Xizhi's calligraphy is that "it surpasses the crowd and is unparalleled in ancient and modern times; it combines the strengths of all and becomes a family!" Such praise does not seem to be related to family affection. To compare him to the Sage Teacher who brought together the great achievements of Confucianism is probably not just my personal opinion. Therefore, the popularity of Wang's script is a natural trend, and it was not necessarily due to the emperor's love. Of course, I believe that the emperor's promotion of the characters of stone workers and potters can also become popular for a while, but if it is said that because the emperor promoted the characters of stone workers and potters, it will forever be the world's law, then I think it is a suspicious thing.</p>
<p>Youjun's calligraphy is treasured by past dynasties, and none of the great masters of the Tang and Song dynasties did not directly or indirectly originate from him. The publication of Chunhua Pavilion帖 has had a greater impact on later calligraphy. However, in the late Ming Dynasty, Dong Qichang's calligraphy was like a classical, morbid beauty. He was congenitally deficient in learning rubbings. Although he did not lose his coordination in the acquired, his pattern was not large and his strength was limited. Unfortunately, he was favored by Emperor Qianlong, and the wind swept through the grass. Wang's rubbing world gradually declined from then on, just like a extremely red persimmon, it can no longer be picked up!</p>
<p>There are many stele inscriptions that can be learned, and learning rubbings must first learn stele inscriptions. Those who only learn rubbings suffer from pettiness, and those who do not learn stele inscriptions lack the unrestrained and joyful charm. We cannot completely deny everything or become slaves to it because of the factions of "stele school" and "rubbing school"! However, during the chaotic Six Dynasties, the calligraphy was perverse. The characters chiseled by calligraphers who did not study and illiterate stone workers and potters are like a peach with hairy skin - and a peach with hairy skin that has been eaten by insects! Bao and Kang bowed down to the calligraphy they co-created. That is their love of eating insect-eaten peaches with hairy skin, it is their strange hobby! (Reward Yiji Poor Relief Fund) (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e85">Literary Figures Despising Each Other <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ming</p>
<p>"Literary figures despise each other, it has been this way since ancient times," this saying was first uttered by Cao Pi. However, the trend of literary figures despising each other did not begin with Cao Pi; in what Cao Pi regarded as ancient times, they already despised each other, so he said: "It has been this way since ancient times." Cao Pi once cited examples of literary figures despising each other; his so-called literary figures specifically referred to those who engage in literature. Indeed, those who write often have the peculiar habit of "my own writing is good"; toward the writing of others, they are always nitpicking, thinking it "beneath contempt."</p>
<p>Why is it that "literary figures despise each other, and it has been this way since ancient times"? It's probably because writing is a work of art. While the general good or bad is not difficult to discern, it is impossible to establish a measuring stick, like a balance or scale, to compare each article, precisely how many points it's good, how many points it's bad. Thus, there is no precise standard for judging writing. Since there isn't one, those who create or appreciate are very prone to subjectivity, and "supporting one's own and attacking different opinions." "Literary figures despising each other" has then "been this way since ancient times."</p>
<p>In fact, extending it further, what is limited to just literary figures when it comes to people despising each other? As the saying goes, "Those in the same trade are bound to be jealous," doesn't it clearly show that whenever there are conflicting interests, whether between people or groups, they often "despise" each other because of "jealousy"?</p>
<p>The manner in which literary figures despise each other is usually through satire in writing, or by engaging in literary feuds. Non-literary figures despising each other, some village women scold and revile, some offer cold sarcasm, some sing their own praises, some fabricate rumors and slander, and some gloat over misfortune. The essence of "advertising" is based on the principle of "despising others" by suppressing others and promoting oneself!</p>
<p>Because they despise each other, writing is a powerful tool; thus, using writing to despise each other is not limited to literary figures alone.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Converting Gardens to Grow Vegetables <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Zhenrong</p>
<p>The economist Mr. Li Quanshi, in his speech at the "Participation in the War and the People" conference, elaborated on the importance of grains, vegetables, and wartime. He hoped that the residents of Shanghai could convert their private gardens to grow vegetables, in order to increase production and reduce the burden of daily life. This is a very important and meaningful suggestion!</p>
<p>With the cost of living so high right now, of course, wealthy families can still rely on rice purchased early, without worrying about the lack of rice. But ordinary small and medium-sized salary earners already feel out of breath just maintaining their lives with their usual meager income, so where would they get extra money to buy and hoard? They can only uniformly hope for an increase in household rice allotments because relying solely on the current amount allocated, even three thin bowls of porridge a day is not enough to fill their stomachs!</p>
<p>At the time, ordinary small and medium-sized salary earners lived in dark alleyway rooms or attics, so where would they have extra gardens to enjoy flowers and trees in their spare time? Therefore, converting gardens to grow vegetables can only be promoted by generally wealthy families with gardens!</p>
<p>The general family entertainment for Chinese people is playing a few rounds of mahjong in their spare time to pass the time. This bad habit has almost become a common problem for urban people. Moreover, some seek pleasure in entertainment venues, so it can be said that the current society is full of holes, and it is the result of wealthy people's actions. Therefore, it reminds us that to promote proper entertainment is the only right remedy to eliminate bad entertainment!</p>
<p>If we find a way to plant vegetables that the family likes and needs in the flower beds and gardens, cultivate and manage them ourselves, and use the spare time in the morning and evening to do some watering work. I believe that this kind of cultivation will allow people who have been trapped in urban life for a long time to experience the fun of rural life. At the same time, it can save money and energy on useless and energy-consuming improper entertainment.</p>
<p>Those who have gardens at home, what's not to be happy about! Look! The cold winter has passed, bringing with it the warm spring breeze and sunshine, and the flowers and trees are flourishing. Then we also have to prepare to show our skills as horticulturalists!</p>
<h3 id="e87">Old Stories of Shanghai Culture and Education <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Qing</p>
<p>Shanghai's movable-type printing technology started in the early years of the Tongzhi reign. Before that, Shanghai's books were all printed by woodblock carving. Later, a Christian missionary named Medhurst came to Shanghai to preach. Due to various inconveniences in preaching, he felt the need to establish a printing house, which would be even more effective in spreading the gospel. Originally, Mr. Medhurst was a printing businessman in London, so relying on his rich experience, he founded the Mo Hai Library (L.M.S. Press). Thus, Shanghai began to have printed books using machines and lead type. At the time, his printing house seemed like a strange thing. Mr. Medhurst's printing house used oxen to drive the axles (there was no electricity in Shanghai at that time). It was very different from today's use of motors to rotate the axles. Now Shanghai's printing industry is thriving and changing with each passing day, and the credit must go to Mr. Medhurst.</p>
<p>Shanghai's first spoken drama was in November of the twenty-eighth year of the Guangxu reign (i.e., 1902). St. John's College, run by the Shanghai Christian Church, began performing spoken dramas. This was followed by Xuhui Public School. However, the plays performed were all Western scripts, and the language spoken by St. John's students was English. The language spoken by Xuhui students was French. Therefore, those who were not familiar with English and French characters were at a loss and did not know what was being performed. The use of Chinese to perform spoken drama actually started at Nanyang Public School. In the twenty-ninth year of the Guangxu reign (1903), during the Boxer Rebellion, they secretly borrowed the winter vacation to compile a new play based on the "Boxer Rebellion Incident" and performed it in the classroom, so very few people knew about it. It was not until the thirty-first year of Guangxu (1905) that Wang Youyou, a student at Minli Middle School, borrowed the spare time of his vacation to create the Wenyu Society, compiled new dramas based on current affairs in society that benefited the world, and performed them at the Chen residence in Huajin Archway. Many people watched it, and it opened the prelude to today's spoken drama.</p>
<p>It is impossible to verify when Shanghai had Western movies. It was probably in the last ten years of the Qing Tongzhi reign. Ge Yuanxu already had a record in his Shanghai You Ji, which was published in the second year of the Qing Guangxu reign. It said: "In front of the Western movie stage, a white cloth curtain is stretched, and a lantern box is hidden in the water. Foreign paintings are placed in the box, changing and replacing the light on the cloth, so mountains, rivers, trees, pavilions, figures, birds, beasts, insects, and fish appear in a strange and bizarre state, as if you are in the scene. It is quite worth seeing." Later, a Spaniard named Lei Mo set up a small cinema near Qinglian Pavilion on Siwei Road around the thirtieth year of Guangxu, but the performances were all short films, which were considered novel at the time.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Anecdotes of Essay Contests <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— You Long</p>
<p>After reading the article in the 18th issue of this journal praising Mr. Jia, the runner-up in the micro-essay contest, the writer was touched and also has a few words to say.</p>
<p>Mr. Jia is still strong in his old age. He is willing to compete with young people, and this "unassuming" attitude is really admirable. Coincidentally, among the names of the selected masterpieces, I found someone comparable to Mr. Jia—that is, Mr. Jiang Pingjie—who is nearly "sixty years old."</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang is from Taicang—and I am from the same hometown, but I have heard of him but do not know him—he has achieved success through diligent study, has a profound understanding of Chinese studies, and is proficient in poetry, lyrics, and prose. His quick writing is even more of a specialty. He has served as a Chinese teacher in middle schools and normal schools. When he enters the classroom, he is full of energy and gives detailed explanations. He is one of the best Chinese teachers in Taicang Middle School. He has served in the education sector for a long time, so before the incident, he had already received the "pension" from the Education Department. Pensions are not easy to enjoy, because they require long service and excellent results, so Mr. Jiang often brags about this. Now, because of the changed circumstances, he is still teaching in Shanghai, not ending his chalk career.</p>
<p>"Essay contests" are a good thing. They gather works from people of different ages, genders, and occupations, evaluate the quality, and indeed increase the interest of readers a lot. However, most participants have a hopeful heart—"being selected" and "winning the prize money"—this is wrong. We know that there are many people and few places, so who can guarantee not to "fail"? We should be like the two seniors, Jia and Jiang, and participate with the "hobby" of "increasing writing skills" and "for interest." It is a joy to be selected, and it does not matter if you are not selected. This is in line with the original purpose of "participating in micro-essays."</p>
<p>A friend of mine spent a week, neglecting sleep and food, writing a long article of 20,000 words to participate in a micro-essay contest a few years ago because the prize money was very high, so he was full of hope for victory. But when the results were announced, he didn't have a "share". He cried loudly and vowed not to participate in essay writing contests again. I advise you all not to have this situation when participating in this newspaper's essay contest, otherwise, it will not only be useless but also harmful!</p>
<p>In art news, the National Academy of Art was established last winter and has three departments: film and drama, and literature. It has achieved remarkable results. Starting from February 14th, it will continue to hold "Weekly Art Lectures." The speakers who have been booked include Huang He, Hu Dao, Shi Hui, Liu Qiong, etc. It starts at 10:00 am every Sunday. The address is No. 414 Weihaiwei Road. All are welcome to attend. The second issue of the "China Art" monthly magazine is about to be published, and the consciousness is correct and meets the needs. The first internship performance will come to fruition in mid-March. The play is tentatively titled "Crossroads," originally written by Shen Xiling, adapted by Lu Si, and directed by Mu Ni. One-tenth of the free quota has been added. If the family situation is indeed poor and you are interested in art, you can register and apply from now on. Recently, Hu Shanyuan and Liu Li have been hired as members of the Academy Affairs Committee. China China, Guangming and other professional theater troupes have reserved to join the theater talents trained by the academy after the training period expires.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Reading, Work, Life <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Hao</p>
<p>An ambitious youth understands and recognizes the true meaning of life through continuous theoretical study and work training. To strive, but first have real skills, to persevere, but first have indomitable cultivation; how can one achieve this goal, one must read more and work more. The interest in reading is best cultivated in childhood, and only in adulthood and old age can one have this good habit. Reading is not only something that should be done in school, but can be continued even after leaving school. What books tell us are just some abstract, theoretical, but systematic basic knowledge that may not necessarily conform to true life. The vast universe is your learning garden everywhere. Every plant, tree, mountain, and river is the object of your research. Nature is the highest institution of learning with perfect equipment, which contains correct consciousness, profound philosophy, and mysterious science. What human intelligence can explore and what writing can express is only the smallest corner, definitely not a complete one, but books can offer you a way to go deeper and indicate a plan for exploration. Treating what books tell you as golden rules and rigid memorization will at most turn you into an encyclopedia for people to look up, but human energy is ultimately limited, so how can it be like that? A Twenty-Four Histories is enough to bother you for a lifetime, memorizing it by force, but what is the origin? Therefore, reading is valuable in living application rather than dead memorization. You must follow the progress of the times, use objective eyes, add reference experience, constantly doubt, and constantly reform, and match life with the times, approach the world, approach things, and make further recognition and further practice. Reading is just learning the principles of being a human being, and integrating life with the environment of the times. Abandoning the concept of dead reading, thereby recognizing the purpose of reading, and then determining a plan and method, not only working hard for tangible books, otherwise you will be eliminated by the environment, you must open your eyes and study and observe the vast society, and take it to enrich life and make it meaningful.</p>
<p>As for work, it is the practice of theory and the expression of personality. To survive, you must work, which has the most sublime interest and the most fair reward. A person's life is originally a continuous gear, which does not allow any stagnation. The more you temper, the more wonderful it is. Constant work brings constant progress. World civilization is changing with each passing day. Reading only tells us how to work, and work solves our lives. This is a reasonable natural development, and there is no place for shame at all. The psychology of getting something for nothing has a toxic deposit in the general population. They think that work is an unavoidable hard labor, and they ignore its most sacred true meaning. They would rather stretch their necks, waiting for the unexpectable God to give them bread, and forget that their innate hands can make bread everywhere. This kind of slavish exposure is such a pathetic thing.</p>
<p>Therefore, one should embrace an interest and a self-confidence in work, otherwise, the spirit will be depressed, the energy will be scattered, and only the dark negative side will be seen forever, not the bright positive side.</p>
<p>Young people, how should you recognize your position, read every day and work every day, constantly seek progress, feel interested everywhere, this is a broad avenue.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Teacher of All Ages <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Ling</p>
<p>(Thirteen)</p>
<p>The years of the First European War.</p>
<p>The first shock, then the first optimism.</p>
<p>The Battle of the Marne, the Russian military government, Kicthoner.</p>
<p>"Do you—uh—think this will last long, sir?"</p>
<p>Gipps was watching the season's first trial match when someone asked him this question, and he gave a very willing answer. He, like millions of others, was falling into a huge mistake; but he, unlike millions of others, did not hide the facts to the end. "We should—ahem—finish this by Christmas—um—Christmas. The Germans have been beaten. But why? Are you thinking of—um—joining up, Forrester?"</p>
<p>Joke—because Forrester was the smallest new student Brookfield had ever seen—only about four feet above his muddy football boots. (But it wasn't entirely a joke, as you'll find out later: because he died in 1918—shot down in flames over Cambrai.) But no one thought about what lay ahead. When Brookfield's first old friend died in battle—in September—it seemed tragically sensational. When the news came, Gipps thought: A hundred years ago, the students in this school were fighting "against" the French. It's a bit odd that one generation's sacrifice should cancel out another generation's sacrifice. He told this idea to Blades, the head of the house, who was eighteen and already training as an officer. Blades just laughed. In any case, what does that kind of historical relic have to do with the present? It's just one of old Gipps' eccentric thoughts, nothing else. (34) Social Services</p>

<p>The "Medical Aid Fund for Elementary School Teachers" initiated by this newspaper has received enthusiastic responses from all walks of life, which is truly inspiring, and demonstrates the enthusiasm of people in the community. Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Wang Yiyi, who said: "Elementary school teachers have meager incomes, and their daily expenses are not enough to make ends meet. Their lives are extremely difficult. Once they get sick, due to economic reasons, they cannot afford treatment, resulting in small illnesses turning into major illnesses, even beyond repair. The family of old and young depends on them for a living, and it is even more difficult to maintain. The initiation of the Medical Aid Fund for Elementary School Teachers is indeed in line with the needs. I will send the three hundred yuan saved by myself and my friends together. I hope that your newspaper can expand the scope, not only to help elementary school teachers, but to know that there are not a few people who are more painful than elementary school teachers. If I wait for the average office worker, the income is very low, and after eating and drinking, it is empty. Once the disease comes, it is really unimaginable."</p>

After listening to the news, I am deeply moved. I will do my best to contribute a little to the cause. In the future, all elementary school teachers who suffer from surgical, orthopedic, and gynecological diseases that require surgical treatment should provide proof documents and contact the hospital in advance. The surgical fee can be completely waived. This is also a responsibility to serve the society."</p>
