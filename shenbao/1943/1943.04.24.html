<h3 id="c1">一面擁護一面督促 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>南京國民政府，是目前中國唯一的政府，是領導中日之間全面和平的政府。自從中日之間不幸事變發生，以至汪主席領導和平運動以來，經國民政府排除萬難，歷盡艱辛，締造今日的局面，尤其是二年以來，發揚和平運動的正確理論，和表現的事實，已使和平區內的人民，認識了國民政府所以致力於和平運動者，完全爲减少人民的生活苦痛，保留復興國家的元氣，以建設未來的新中國。我們承認國民政府的領導人物，確實懷抱爲國爲民的高尙理想，獻身和運。諺云：「疾風知勁草，板蕩識忠臣，」汙泥雖可一時蒙蔽眞珠，終有一旦顯露寶光。所以，參加和運者。初不必掛齒於形式上的論功行賞，後世歷史的記述，決不會黑白混淆，是非不明的。</p>
<p>我們推論事情的眞理，需要冷靜的客觀的理智，加以判斷。囿於一時的情感，片面的利害觀念的推論，往往適得其反。我們認爲在主席倡導的和平運動，是適應時勢的需要。除非別具用心者以外，相信每個人都贊成，或是默認的。這裏所謂「別具用心」者，換言之，就是反對和平運動者，我們可以歸納爲三種；</p>
<p>第一是重慶政權。他們的抗戰，始以蔣介石的政治投機，企圖倖勝，得維持其獨裁的政權。可是，旣爲政治投機，不得不依賴英美，因而招致失敗的結果，繼以老羞成怒的蠻幹下去，作無底拖戰，置人民困苦於不顧，甘心被英美利用，至死不悟。</p>
<p>第二是共產黨。他們一味執行第一國際的政策，根本不管祖國的利益，一方面加緊壓迫重慶政權拖戰到底，一方面積極擴展其政治勢力。不到祖國與人民「同歸於盡」，不肯罷休。</p>
<p>第三是和平運動中的失敗主義者與動搖份子。他們一方面參加和平運動，作爲掩護；一方面製造種種阻碍和平運動的事實，以阻撓和運的進展。他們掛了和運的招牌，而行其混水撈魚的勾當，例如利用職位之優越，從事囤積，或兼營商業。說句痛切話，他們見了眞正全面和平，就會害怕，失去混水撈魚的機會。所以他們的反對是實，而參加是虛。這一種人，是全面和平途上最大的障碍物，也是最爲眞正爲和運獻身者的仇敵。</p>
<p>所以，我們竭誠盼望國民政府於努力實現國內全面和平的進行中，必須淸楚透視真的反對者是那幾種，而尤須謹愼提防自己陣營裏的失敗主義者與動搖份子，澈底的加以肅淸。不然，他們的潛力滋長，以後養癰成患，是極可能的事。我們在愛護政府的立塲，敢於鄭重指出的。</p>
<p>自從一月九日國民政府對英美宣戰以後，對內旣須促成全面和平，對外尤須與盟邦日本協力擊敗英美。政府的責任，旣加重一層，對於人民的要求，自然也加重一層。而政府的一舉一動，更與人民有密切關係。政府的事，就是人民的事，人民的事，也就是政府的事。政府的措施，以人民爲前提，這措施才能得人民的支援。這樣政府與人民合爲一體，才能發揮總力，對內促成全面和平，對外爭取戰爭勝利。爲了造成政府與人民一體的力量，我們就需要一面擁護政府，唯恐不誠；一面督促政府，唯恐不嚴</p>
<p>我們輿論界的責任，是在溝通政府和人民的意見，一面宣示政府意旨，以告人民；一面傳達人民公意，以聞政府。我們發爲主張，無非本於人民大衆的意見。如果以爲我們主張了「改善政治機構」，「修明政治」，「刷新人事」，「澈底澈查投機囤積」，「官商分野」，以及種種政治的，經濟的，社會的改革獻言，是在反對政府，這種觀念，實在要不得的。我們也深信賢明的當局，不但不會有這種觀念，而將重視我們善意的獻言。</p>
<p>惟有眞正敢進諍言者，才是眞正擁護政府者；惟有眞正能受盡言的政府；才是值得竭誠擁護的政府；也惟有眞正敢於督促政府的人民，才是愛護國家的現代公民。我們更不辭繁複的提出：「一面擁護政府，唯恐不誠；一面督促政府，唯恐不嚴。」以爲一般曲解「擁護」與「反對」意義者告。</p>

<h3 id="c2">軸心軍隊有利地勢　決心堅守突尼西亞　英軍在恩斐達維爾發動總攻　地雷陷阱密佈承認作戰困難 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電　此間獲息：英蒙特高茂萊所部第八軍在突尼西亞戰綫南端之恩斐達維爾開始總攻後，突尼西亞戰綫即進入決戰階段，英軍刻與德名將羅美爾所部之軸心軍展開激戰中。</p>
<p>瑞典京城廿二日中央社電　同盟社特派員齊籐稱：突尼西亞之最後爭奪大戰，現正由英第八軍及羅美爾元帥所部德國非洲軍團之精銳激烈進行。據瑞典京城所接獲之消息，劇戰現時在恩斐達維爾地區進行。英方會一度暗示，謂羅美爾元帥或將效法鄧扣克一役，以冀保存其部隊，但現時則謂渠已決心作戰到底。英方消息並承認德軍巳掘壕固守，並有良好之物質及軍火供應，英方消息謂蒙特高茂萊將軍之陣綫自恩斐達維繭西向伸展的八十公里，但亦承認該處地區全部皆滿布德方之地雷機關槍陣地坦克車陷阱乃其他障碍，而德軍陣綫之猛烈砲火，亦足表明德軍之配備良。倫教消息承認甚難突入突尼斯至比塞大之防地。瑞典京城之軍界宜稱，無論突尼西亞大戰結果如何，大體上實係德方之巨大成功，蓋穗軍巳獲得時閒以準備英美之或將向　陸進攻。彼等指出歐洲現時乃整個的堡壘，並有軸心壯士八百萬準備出發云。</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　據海通社軍事特派員稱：突尼西亞戰綫之南段大戰繼續增劇。蒙特高茂萊將軍所部之右翼，經猛烈之戰鬥後，巳佔領恩斐達維兩，並冀圖沿海岸更向北進，但此處英軍於星期三僅進至恩斐達維國之外數公里。處於海岸及山嶺間之一帶平坦土地並不廣大，現時仍爲駐在高地之軕心軍　兵听控制，因此英第八軍之右翼，在其中路及左翼未有更大之進展前，不能伸過遠。但英軍之中路及左翼並未能追隨其右翼，現時正在南面及西南面之斜坡作戰，冀圖進入山嶺。至星期二晚，亦僅在數處據點獲得立足地。從該處至山嶺之中央地區距離尙遠，中央地區地勢更高，非經重大困難不易抵達。該處軸心軍有極强固之防守陣地，將步步抵抗。蒙特高茂萊將軍之中路現正在斜坡作戰，爭取進入山嶺內部之狹小水路達加魯納村，但未得逞，至星期三晚，該村仍在軸心軍手中。德軍在西面猛攻，深人敵軍後方，因此英第八軍絕少疾進之機會。蒙特高茂萊將軍企圖佔領恩斐達維爾西北及西面之高地，自昨日淸晨時起，英軍及紐西蘭軍卽開始進攻，因此處地勢國難運用坦克車，故英軍巳使用較多之砲隊及飛機，極猛烈之戰鬥仍在繼續中。法軍原在英第一軍及第八軍會師之處下陣，因遭德軍之猛烈反攻，幾將上星期所獲之土地全部失去，至星期三日顯然又復擔任向彭杜法斯及傑貝爾柴格霍安前進，以稍事援助蒙茂萊將軍，但此舉並無力量。在突尼西亞橋頭堡之西部戰綫，英第一軍於星期三大事準備。安特森將軍似欲利用是日，以完成其大規模新攻勢之透澈準備，但德軍以强有力之部隊，在梅傑茲埃爾巴勃地區作偵察攻擊，予英軍以重大阻撓，英軍猝然無備，損失大砲四尊，並被俘甚衆。德軍完成任務後卽安然撤退。彼等尸證實安特森將軍在西部戰綫之北段，已集中有英步兵三師及英坦克車一師，在第二綫並有美軍及法軍部隊，因此渠亦擁有優越之人力及物力，以備未來之大規模新攻擊，僅較蒙特高茂萊將軍所擁有者略遜一籌而巳。</p>
<h3 id="c3">軸心勁旅開赴前線　準備與英一決雌雄 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電　反軸心軍於未開始總攻以前，即動員官傳機關，散布謠言，謂軸心軍將重演第二鄧扣克之悲劇，而由突尼西亞戰綫撤退云，殊不知德義兩國軍事要員數次協議後，已決死守非洲大陸之橋頭堡壘。德羅美爾將軍亦憚精竭慮，採用內綫作戰之有利性，決使突尼西亞戰綫成爲軸心軍之斯丹林格勒。據倫敦來電，美陸次巴德猗會力戒美人對北非戰局勿樂觀，謂反軸心軍今後在突尼西亞戰綫作戰將更困難，並須忍受莫大犧牲云。另據倫教電稱，英各報對北非戰局亦極重視，並注視其歸趨，如每日快報載稱？英第八軍刻在恩斐達維兩起至其西方八十公里之地點展開戰鬥，但軸心軍在該方面佈滿地雷，並架滿機關槍，到處掘有戰壕，其軍火亦極充足，故英軍進攻實非容易。又據倫敦另一電稱，英第八軍在恩斐達維爾戰綫巳攻破軸心陣地云，惟德軍當局對此巳加以否認。聞西西里島通前綫之運輸殆吿停止。但軸心軍決意與反軸心軍一決雌雄，巳將無用之兵員全部撤往後方，前綫士兵均爲勁旅，決定於必要時在速繫突尼斯比塞大兩港之戰綫，死守陣地。又英國消息靈通方面一致認爲現在默洲大陸悉成爲要塞，軸心軍防備極爲鞏固，而反軸心軍欲在歐洲開關第二戰綫，無異暴虎憑河。衆認突尼西亞戰綫之推移，影響地中海之制海權者至深且巨，最近四五週內戰局之推移，尤值注目。</p>
<h3 id="c4">阿特拉斯山脈一帶　德軍奇襲收穫戰果 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據悉，突尼西亞戰綫之軸心軍對約二倍之反軸心軍現仍繼續奮戰。頃據穗軍司令部發表，二十二日軸心軍除於防禦戰時獲有成果外，且於梅傑茲埃爾巴勃西方出以先發之攻勢，並收獲相當戰果。綜合前綫各地戰况消息如次：（一）南部戰綫反軸心軍開始空前之猛攻，尤以砲兵隊之砲擊最爲激烈，二十一日僅於一小地區內，卽落下砲彈達五十枚。目下英第八軍攻擊之焦點，乃在恩斐達維兩北方之海岸地帶，軸心軍於北部防禦綫之梅捷茲埃爾巴勃及布阿拉達兩地中間地區，曾施行大規模之奇襲攻擊，傳於溪谷地帶及阿特拉斯山脈之丘凌地帶之實廣戰綫上，向西方推進，巳殲滅敵軍大半。是役軸心軍所獲戰果雖尙未詳報，然迄現在所判明者，除破毀反軸心軍迫擊砲陣地六處外，截獲及破壞英戰車十一輛裝甲偵察車四輛俘虜反軸心軍兵士四百人，其中英兵二百三十六人。同時於捷諾爾曼斯路地區，德突擊隊亦突入反軸心軍陣地，俘虜敵三十名，其中並有參謀一名。又軸心空軍在突尼西亞全綫與地上部隊緊密協力作戰，二十一日在空戰中，擊落反輔心飛機十七架，內有四架轟炸機數架此外並猛炸行進中之反軸心軍部隊·兵營·及補給基地等。又曾空襲阿爾及爾及斐利普維爾兩港。於阿爾及爾港重創五千噸之輸送船一艘，此外並炸中三千噸船一艘。同時斐利普維爾港之港灣設施及軍需品貯藏庫亦被炸起火。</p>

<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　據德軍當局發表：自一九四〇年秋我季裏比亞戰爭開始以來，，至本年四月二十八日止，英軍及其他反軸心軍共喪失戰車四千五百輛。聞其中二千七百三十四輛，係在一九四二年九月二十五日起至本年四月十八日之襲間內喪失者。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十二日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社訊，據此間所接消息：倫教所接突尼西亞前方報吿，證實英第八軍在南部前綫作戰，確受重大損失。又據美聯電訊：謂救護車輛現不絕來往於前方急救站與後方野戰醫院之間云。</p>
<h3 id="c6">山西日軍　對渝軍展開新作戰　克服太行山脈天險 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　據山西南部，太行山脈日軍前綫某地來電，該地日軍當局。於今日下午二時，就日軍此次在山西展開新作戰事，發表談話。大意謂：當地日軍，與附近各部隊，取得聯絡，在協力合作下，開始向南部太行山脈地區陵川，林縣，及臨淇附近一帶渝軍第二十四集團軍，展開新作戰，並巳於四月二十日將該卞面渝軍完全包圍，目下正進行殲滅中。至於此次戰况，日軍始終在順利之中進展，又在此次作戰時，山西剿共軍及中國方面各武裝團體，亦以同生共死之精神，奮勇與日軍協力作戰。又渝軍第二十四集團軍，係由龐炳動所指揮其部下之第二十七軍軍長劉進，第四十軍軍長馬法吾，以及新編第三軍軍長孫殿英等三軍爲主，兵力共約八萬二千，乃渝軍在華北方面之最後努力。</p>
<p>（又訊）據山西南部前綫二十三日電訊：日華北派遣軍精銳部隊，爲剿滅隱匿晋冀豫三省邊境太行山脈中之渝方冀察戰區「總司令蔣鼎文」，第二十四集團軍龐炳勳，第二十七軍軍長馬法吾，及新編第五軍軍長孫殿英等起見，乃於極秘密中開始行動。該處渝軍，前於陵川（晋省）李縣（豫省）臨洪（豫省）等三角地帶，企圖蠢動，妄想出舉，此次日軍於十六日開始淸剿作戰後，首將盤據於修武焦作北方山地之渝縣政府軍覆滅，旋即北進，克服太行山脈之天險，於各地掃蕩殘餘渝軍，二十二日即進抵豫晋省境各要衝。進迫渝第二十四集團軍據點臨洪，現巳指日可下。同時並與南下之日軍各部隊，互相呼應，向前挺進，此外日陸軍航空部隊，亦於二十一日夜，利用月色夜襲渝軍，痛炸徬徨中之敗殘渝軍，並以機槍猛烈　射，使日軍地上部隊，更易於進擊，迄二十三日止，日軍巳將包圍團益形縮小，着着圍擊。</p>
<p>太行山日軍佔臨淇</p>
<p>北京二十三日中央社電　太行山脈南部日軍隊某地二十三日電，日軍精銳部隊二十三日，突入渝軍據點臨淇，刻正肅淸殘敵。按臨洪爲渝軍之前進據點，實爲肅淸京漢綫方面治安之癥結。</p>
<p>北平廿三日中央社電　華北方面日軍，此次展開新作戰之目標，乃在殲滅冀察戰區方面之渝軍，蓋自民國二十八年初夏，日軍在山西省東部及潞安澤州附近展開作戰後，即期殲滅該方面渝軍，繼於是年底及二十九年春之間，復展開冬季攻勢作戰，予渝軍以重大打擊。卅年五月，日軍又再展開中原會戰，當時渝軍會遺屍四萬二千具，並被俘二萬九千人，同時渝軍在華北方面之各據點，歷次全被覆滅。民國卅一年六月，在晉冀豫省境作戰時，日軍復殲滅愉軍第廿七軍，是役渝軍第十八集團軍副參謀長左橫亦陣亡，又新編第五軍暫繼第三師長劉月享，亦參加和運，以上各次肅淸作戰，均已碎渝軍企圖。然此次日軍作戰之主要目的，在殲潰渝軍第廿四集團軍，按渝方雖兵力物資兩感不足，但對該軍之訓練，會儘極大努力。</p>

<p>南京二十三日中央社电電　日駐華派遣軍，四月二十三日，發表一週戰况云：華北各省之共匪軍，恐日方對華之新政策，日漸發展而加多妨碍，乃圖擾亂治安地區之民心，尤其對於中國方面之組織，集中其謀略，極力破壞。但中國方面之自覺，日漸增高，共匪軍之企圖，巳被擊潰　搖動。日軍三月份明俘　軍中，爲渝軍一八三四人，與匪軍人數雙方相多二倍以上，較諸一二兩月之相差平均，僅達一二倍。顯示共產之俘虜，巳趨逐漸增加之傾向。而長江下流方面之俘虜，及歸順人數，亦有增加，故抗戰理論，已因和平理論而漸吿崩潰。日方新政策，巳漸使民間了解。但另一方面，渝魯蘇戰區副司令所部，竟爲共匪軍之俘虜，江南溧水南方地區，更有渝軍與新四軍互相衝突。當此之時，日方畑總司令視察華北各地，指出作戰警備之責任上，應決定外，將國府治下之一切反抗蠢動，予以肅淸，目前山西方面，正展開活潑之作戰，今後該方面戰局之推移，城足拭目以待。</p>
<h3 id="c7">陳內長秴記者問　詳論各項內政問題 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>南京二十三日中央社電　中央社記者日昨往訪內政部擾陳羣氏，當蒙接見，對記者叩詢各項內政問題，承解答如次：</p>
<p>問：中國參戰以後，內政之重心爲何？</p>
<p>答：中國參戰以來，內政部的工作重心，爲確保治安工作，故訓練警察，乃爲當務之急。自國府參戰以後，各地治安，均須我們自己担負完全責任，所以要進一步訓練警察，加强地方實力，可以負担實際的責任。現在各地警察，均由省市政府直接負責兼受內政部之監督，以致訓練方針及教靑水準，尙未能一致。且有一事最感缺點者，即警察素質，不甚健全，內政部旣負有監督警察之賣，今後對於此點，當加以努力。</p>
<p>問：敢問對於促進廉潔政治，有何見解？</p>
<p>答：廉潔政治，是政治修明的必要條件。如執政之人，不能廉潔則政治必黑暗，國家的一切建設，也就無從問起。政府要人中，早有廉潔座談會之舉行，但僅爲交換各個人之意見。政府官員，人人身體力行，廉潔政治，必定修明，民生才　有樂利。</p>
<p>問：此次政府派員懲辦囤積，部長對其之結果，作如何之觀察？</p>
<p>答：囤積投機之風，影響人民生計，國家徑濟至鉅，此次汪主席斷然下令，從嚴查辦，俾安民心，以杜好究，惟是制裁團積投機者，自宣破除情面，不可稍存姑息之意，只要將擾亂市塲之人，從嚴查辦幾個，我想沒有人再敢以身試法了。</p>
<p>問：現下　實施之一部份物資配給，是否有改良餘地？</p>
<p>答：物資配給辦法，必須要分配平衡，就是不患寡而息不均。物資數量，如果能够供求相應，最合理想，物資數量，雖不大充足，必定要先顧到一般民衆的需要，對於一般平民要體恤他們，對於公務員也要念其艱苦，現在巳有主管機關正在計劃辦法。</p>
<p>問：對於靑少年之訓練，有何意見？</p>
<p>答：關於訓練青少年，是由新國民運動促進委員會主辦，鄙人對於主辦之人，極表欽佩，不過訓練靑少年，有一個簡易的心理試騐，就是要靑少年們聽話聽命令。今令全國靑少年一律剃光頭，看他們肯不肯這樣服從我，就我所主辦之正始中學全部學生均剃光頭，友邦日本的靑少年，在中學校或大學預科或高等學校，都是剃光頭，在離開大學以前，或是沒有在社會上做事，很少留了長頭髮的。此外還要鍛練體格，實行訓練，所以個個精神飽滿，體力健壯，然後才能做到實行服務，才不負受訓原旨，能够做到這樣，才算訓練的初步成功。</p>

<p>東京二十三日中央社電　據仙台電話：日本大本營陸軍報道部長谷萩少將，令日下午六時在仙台市公會堂發青演說，以「完成大東亞戰爭」爲題，說明日軍在廣大之大東亞區域內作戰及建設所獲之偉大戰果，並指出英美兩國現已對日本抱有極大之恐怖，最後又告全日本一億國民，應以必勝之信念，作更進一步之努力，以完成大東亞戰爭。茲錄大意如次：英美兩國當局，最近爲振作沮喪之士氣，特使其國民發生一種錯覺，故於最近屢次論及　和問題及在戰後之統治問題等。此種言論不僅爲紙上談兵，且更未免過早，故實令人可笑，但亦由此可見其自私自利之主義，並暴露美國企圖制霸世界之野心。當南方作戰時，美軍曾將巳受重傷之日軍將士予以苛刑，並又到處虐待日僑，其最違背國際公法蔑視人道者，即在白晝襲擊日本之紅十字船。又英軍在各處作戰時，屢驅使其他民族出陣突擊，使以血肉之軀抵禦無情槍彈，而保自身之安全，更如凌辱良民掠奪糧食等等，在在均是暴露其惡劣之行爲。至於此次世界大戰之新動向，約可分爲三點：</p>
<p>（一）戰場之擴大　此次大戰爲兩個世界觀完全相異的國家集團之決戰。目下全世界除若干中立國及日本與蘇聯仍保持中立關係外，大致可分爲軸心及反軸心兩大部分。同時兩集團不斷在繼續決戰中，大東亞戰爭爆發後，日軍即在廣大之區域內，展開擊滅英美兩國在東亞據點之偉大作戰，迄今戰局大勢業巳可以決定。</p>
<p>（二）作戰速度之迅速　回憶日俄戰爭時，日軍自於七月下旬由遼東半島及鴨綠江方面開始行動，至翌年二月奉天會戰爲止，歷時約十閱月，其閒日軍之征途僅有四百公里，然在此次大東亞戰爭中，日軍山下兵團在馬來半島進擊千餘里公里，爲時僅兩月，足見此次戰爭中之作戰速度，遠較過去爲快。</p>
<p>（三）軍隊之科學化　如此次歐戰中，德軍攻陷波蘭及在法國北部會戰時，均爲德機械化部隊之閃電戰。又如日軍在攻擊蘇門答臘巨港時，會使用降落傘部隊而一舉成功。自大東亞戰爭發生迄今，英美兩國巳充分感到日軍戰力之强大，共最顯著之例，即去年八月至本年二月間之南太平洋方面作戰，及本年三月日溪北部馬酋河畔之殲滅戰等。又日軍爲謀取得充分時間，在南方佔領地建築陸上根據地以及戰略上各據點之設施起見，曾於去年八月至本年二月間，派掩護部隊，向所羅門羣島瓜達卡納爾島及新幾內亞島各方面挺進。該掩護部隊之奮勇力戰，實在戰史上創造最光榮之一頁。日軍所具之「神武」特質及尙武精神，使自大之美軍恐怖戰慄，同時美國亦自認彼等之優越，巳根本動搖。又美輿論亦一致謂美軍與勇武之日軍作戰實爲不利，美國各方面均認美軍團一一攻陷太平洋上無數島嶼，實難達到最後目的，因美軍若圖攻抵東京，尙須百年之長期間，並須有較今日美軍數百倍以上之兵力。又英印軍最近會企圖收復緬甸之馬西河畔開始攻擊，但其五旅團及一分隊之兵力，已悉被日軍所殲，又其他三旅團，亦分向四處亂竄，不僅潰不成軍，即其戰鬥力，亦已喪失，因此反軸心軍對日軍益爲恐怖。大東亞戰爭之前途，雖尙遙遠而多難，但勝利已確實在吾掌中。總之，此次戰爭乃爲天地正義之神聖戰爭，日本國民，均　以決死之精神努力完成戰爭。</p>

<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據墨爾挑訊：西南太平洋麥克沃塞總司令部昨日發表公報稱，四月二十一日晚閒日機乘皓月當空，再襲新幾內亞東南部反軸心軍之陣地。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　據此間讀賣報知二十二日晚報載阿根廷京城特電稱：日軍航空部隊最近因在西南太平洋方面不斷展開大攻勢，致使美澳兩軍當局大爲狼狽。美澳兩國內各界亦一致要求當局重行檢討西南太平洋戰局，同時麥克沃塞爲此事，亦會與美海長諾克斯發生摩擦。頃悉，美國前亞洲艦隊司令雅納爾上將會於本月二十一日在普林斯登出席海軍集會時，提及西南太平洋戰局，力言日軍在西南太平洋之陣勢，巳非美海軍之力所能攻破，大意謂，日軍在西南太平洋方面確保之態度，確具重大意義，即彼已能決定太平洋各國今後五十年之運命，今若不將日軍驅出中國，則美海軍恐難能以自力殲滅日軍。但據目下情勢而觀，因反軸心軍在中國方面並無有效攻勢，故美國應儘量使戰爭延長，在此期閒中，更應以空軍或潛艇對日作戰，日軍在太平洋方面所採取之偉大攻勢，實爲戰史上所未有者。其間美國須應用一切手段，妨害日本在中國·菲列濱·印度·馬來半島·東印度·以及澳洲·紐西蘭方面建設經濟國云云。又澳洲駐美公使愛華德亦會於廿日在紐約發表談話，略謂，澳洲現已直接遭受日軍之威脅，目下美國若再不開始攻勢，則恐澳洲將永遠無法存在云。又美中央日報亦載論批評雜納爾上將之見解過弱，並主張立即開始攻勢，大意謂，日本之勝利，將長時期左右世界歷史，美國應排除任何困難，予日本以重大打擊云。此外渝方中央日報亦載謂，認美海軍上將雅納兩曾久居中國，素有東亞通之稱，今亦指反軸心軍在中國方面並無有效攻勢等，實足以暴露美國强化援渝之不可靠，大意謂，反軸心軍廉立即對日本採取攻勢，若日本以先發制人之手段攻擊姨洲，即則反軸心軍不僅喪失對日攻勞之機會，即被日本擊，　之可能性，亦因而增加云云。以上因雅納爾之見解而引起之各種　論，均足顯示養國在西南太平洋方面指導作戰上之混亂情形。</p>

<p>斯丹埠二十三日中央社電　反軸心軍對西亞各國之壓迫干涉，最近益形露骨，故原住民之反感亦日深。頃據開羅來電，埃及民衆茲以日常生活不便爲理由，又强烈要求緩和英軍設定之戒嚴地區，此聲浪巳漸波及全國。但英軍當局竟不顧目前情勢，反將戒嚴地區擴展至埃及南部，且於亞力山大設置軍法處二處，完全漢視國民意見，致埃及民衆之反感更加深刻。</p>

<p>佐藤軍務局長演說</p>
<p>四月十四日九時起，在陸軍省舉行的第二次陸軍技術研究會席上，陸軍省軍務局長佐籐賢了少將，對於到會的一千三百陸軍技術關係者即席演說，喚起科學技術者的奮起。在今後戰爭遂行的過程上，科學技術所負擔的任務，歸納於如次三點：（一）生產的躍進，（二）作戰資材的改良躍進，（三）完成可制英美於死命的方策。以下爲演詞的全文：</p>
<p>到今日爲止，日本的作戰，以神速爲主旨，採取絕對攻勢以構成大東亞共榮圈，並鞏固對英美決戰的立足點。在所有强國與强國之間的戰爭上，假使一方櫃續其攻勢，無論在甚麼時候，終是用全部力量從事其攻勢。反之，對方則被迫退却，在其策源地的附近，補充並恢復其戰力。如此攻防的地點，遂時有變遷，經過一次攻防戰，戰爭的處所便變遷一次，這是戰爭中的慣例。徵之戰史，歷歷不爽，即在埃及戰綫上，我們亦可以目擊這現實。</p>
<p>日本雖在幾千公里的廣袤之大陸及海洋上繼續不斷的採取神速無比的攻勢，然攻防之勢，迄今尙未改觀，我方依然保持攻勢，而未嘗陷於守勢。在戰略上全世界實爲之驚異不置。但最近敵人似乎在我追擊之前立定了。今後我方終須繼續進攻，那麼，爲了堅特戰勢的主動權，除精神力，用兵等問題之外，勝負關鍵，繫於生產力這問題上。固然，敵我雙方生產力的絕對量，敵方逮勝於我。唯如東條首相的施政演說中所說：日本自開戰以來，即確保攻勢，把戰略據點的偉大價值，來增加我生產力，並迅即提高這生產力，使能與敵方的生產力對抗。這是左右今後戰勢之絕對的課題。</p>
<p>日本原有的軍需資源，向卽不能自給自足。所以新占領地域的開發，建設，不消說，在今後的生產上，極爲重要。卽確保及强化中日滿與南方諸地域，現在的生產態勢，是日本今後生產的生命。但道生產態勢，必須與大東亞戰爭之決戰基礎的戰略態勢相一致。換句話說，現在的戰略態勢若不利，則必破壞生產態勢。反之，生產態勢若不固，亦必碍及戰略態勢。總之，確保這戰爭和生產態勢的一致，是今後日本戰爭指導上絕對的問題。</p>
<p>攪亂這戰爭和生產態勢一致的敵人有二：其一爲飛機，其二爲潛水艦。今日飛機在戰鬥上有極大的威力，尤其在海洋中，飛機可設是戰鬥的王座。此徵之於今日以前的作戰經過，至爲顯然，尤其在南太平洋上，我們從來的觀念以爲勝上的戰鬥是陸軍，海上的戰鬥是海軍，陸海軍個別作戰，這觀念現在必須完全改變了。</p>
<p>在大陸上，飛機的威力，尙不能視是絕對的，所以與向來的戰鬥狀態尙沒有大變化。在海洋上，敵我雙方同在星棋羅佈的島嶼上設定飛行基地，把這飛行基地網視爲作戰組織的主幹，以此爲中心，發揮陸海空三位一體的綜合戰力而戰鬥。因飛機的戰鬥威力的增大，造成飛行基地網爲作戰組織主幹的情勢。無制空權者亦無制海權，旨哉斯言。</p>
<p>於是戰鬥之初，必先由陸海協同攻略海洋中的島嶼，設定爲飛行基地，築造堅固的防禦工事以圖固守，並以之爲補給的基地。航空戰爲戰鬥中的主役，而艦艇之戰，陸兵之戰，乃與航空戰並行展開。於此，敵我勢力中在航空方面假使發生了顯著的優劣之勢，則佔優勢者用其餘力破壞對方的後方洋上交通。</p>
<p>所以戰鬥的情勢，一變而爲戰鬥上佔王座地位的飛機，與戰鬥上荏弱無力的運輸船之間的戰爭。結果，除使第一綫部隊的給養發生困難之外，並因船腹的損失而妨及生產態勢。</p>
<p>潛水艦自然也是運輸船的大敵。英美止爲着軸心國的潛水艦而叫苦不迭。在陸地的戰鬥上，飛機的威力雖尙未佔絕對的王座，但中國常被視爲敵方飛機的基地，用以轟炸我本土及破壞海上交通。我方乃先發制人，加以擊滅，並在本土嚴密防空。這些措置，都是確保我生產態勢上重要的問題。</p>
<p>由此看來，爲了確立戰爭和生產兩種態勢，戰鬥上佔王座的飛機之增產，乃是絕對的要務。航空戰力若佔優勢，除可以獲得制空權及共他戰略的優勢外，並可用其餘力繞出敵後擊破其運輸船，打擊其給養與生產力。假使航空戰力處於劣勢的地位，則上述諸情勢恰巧相反。</p>
<p>造船問題是次於飛機的生產擴充的重要問題。造船方面須有大量生產，並爲了對付飛機，潛水艦，尤其爲了從敵機跳標下補充給養至前綫，除增加船腹量之外，更須有特殊的研究。所以我國的增產，第一是飛機，（陸海車的主要兵器是當然的，故不在此例）；第二是船舶，其次是與其他軍需生產的增强有關的鋁·鐵。煤。前次制空的戰時特例法，也因此而特別提出這五大產業。</p>
<p>自去年起，政府自總理大臣起，領導研討一切施策，所有的政治力，行政力，集中於生產擴充這一點，官民亦很理解政府的實旨，共同努力生產，其效果，超出了預期之外。</p>
<p>在本年度，造船的大量生產漸上軌道，建造木造船，打撈沉船等方法，積極進行，故船舶的損害雖較上年度激化，但船舶的增加，可指日以待。同樣，飛機·鋁·鐵。·煤等，都因官民的一致努力，而奏效甚大。這情勢在本年度當然可以維持，並且希望更爲强化。</p>
<p>我們必須注意，我國生產態勢的特質，是南方諸地域及中國，滿洲與日本本土的結合。即生產的要道，有賴於海上的運輸力。船腹的節約，必須以米等食糧品，其他軍需品關係品，及國民的生活必需品的增產爲限。如此，始能騰出船腹來增產五大產業及其他重要產業，而可以增强戰力，强化戰略態勢與生產態勢。從事生產軍需關係品，生活必需品的人們，即生產陣營中的戰士，以及其他不在這陣營中的人們，甚至於在家庭中，不僅煤氣·電氣·煤等應該節約，別的一切東西如其都能節約起來，因而節約了生產資源，以及運輸這些資源的船腹，這也就是生產增强的一面。</p>
<p>去年秋季以來，由於政府·官·民的一致努力，效果至爲偉大，實堪慶幸。而本戰爭特微之一的長期消耗戰，亦因而得以勝任。</p>
<p>在以前，每經過一次戰事，兵器有一度的改良與革新。此次戰爭之前，一般兵器，如以前次歐洲大戰爲標準，可大別爲大戰前型，大戰型，及大戰後型三種。在此次戰爭中，兵器的變遷，與前大不相同，眞所調日新月異，現在舉例來看，此次戰爭中兵器的進步怎樣左右戰爭的局勢。</p>
<p>在去年夏的北非戰機，備義軍一夜中攻克杜勃香克要奉，長驅直入埃入，產歷山大利亞在望。這一戰役之偉大的成功，實由於備軍對戰事兵器的發明，與戰車冷氣裝置的新改良所致。今冬紅單的多間攻擊所以有意外的力量者，實因紅軍戰車及對戰車兵器的準備，與這些機械化部隊之運用訓練的徹底，爲有力的主因。新近有一種幾戒器用超短波可預知敵潛水艦與飛機的接近，因爲限制了潛水艦的活動範圍，在數百公里之前即巳預知飛機的接近，於是避免其奇襲的方也進步起來。這種警戒器現在竟可以算定服機的方向距離，與高射砲有連繫，不問有霧·雲·或在夜間，不看見飛機也可以對其射擊。</p>

<h3 id="c53">保富法應用的商榷　（二） <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>按保富法之原意，聶雲台老居士己詳言之，參乎天道盈虛消長之說，佛學因果報應之理，其聶氏家乘有「南嶽鍾靈，南陔衍慶，七旬介壽，七子成名」之佳話，爲「先樂山公醫藥濟人之報」，正如大學所云「仁者以財發身，不仁者以身發財」·行善積德，更可爲醫藥界同仁所借鏡也。</p>
<p>不論何人，不能避免生老病死諸苦，而醫藥有關於資生防老治病救死，要處處以仁心仁意應付之，古之業醫藥者，所謂「修合無人見，存心有天知」，隨緣濟人，每逢朔望送藥，即今時國藥號每逢朔望特予優待，猶有遺風。至欲求如韓康賣藥長安市，三十餘年，口不二價，已不可能矣。</p>
<p>保富無他法，「大富由天，小富由人」。人爲之富，是自私的，天然之富，是大公的。而物質之富，僅誇耀於當時，精神之富，可留芳於將來。所以道德文章，功動事業，比之金玉珠寶，田產房屋，各有因緣。今日從事於精神勞動者，若教帥·若廉吏·有　被萬卷書而不能領數升米，數尺布，其貧寒可想，然顏回一第食，一瓢飲，人不堪其憂，而孔子稱其賢，人各有志，尙精神之樂，不欲保有　之富也。我國老聃之學，「無爲守眞」，佛陀之說，「觀空妙有一，不貪人爲之財，而欲保天然之富也。</p>
<p>科學方法，亦不外乎循天然之原理，盡人力之精究，可以造就種種財富，如愛迪生發明電燈，瓦特氏發明蒸汽機，司蒂芬孫發明火車，使全世界增加無量財源。然應用科學方法，從事各種企業，或如合作社之組織，「人人爲我，我爲人人」，可以减輕大衆生活之艱困。或如保險公司之聯營，「從統計上預防損失，從互助上分担危害」，可以保障一切災險之意外，凡此種種，皆有保富意味。</p>
<p>科學極爲廣大圓通，所謂自然科學，乃研究萬事萬物，所謂精神科學，乃研究萬理萬想，宇宙萬有，分析之至簡，有唯心論，有唯物論，唯物上倡平等，仍有鬥爭，唯心上倡平　，始有大同。所以東方道義精神，比之西方種種科學，可保富於久遠。蓋西方物質文明之流弊，看重私利，但知互相剝奪，互相俊軋，古人所謂居心不仁，則父母兄弟可以成異國，居心而仁，則天物人物皆可爲同體。人人求私富，遽生荊棘於坦道，衆苦交集；人人爲公富，則化干戈爲玉帛，安樂無涯。尤望腎明當局，發揮古聖賢之精神，大學云：「一家仁，一國興仁，一家讓，一國興讓，一人貪利，一國作亂」。是故人人欲貪私富，則大亂永無寗息之時也。</p>
<p>夫貧病交逼，最爲人世之慘，必先求世人之不貧不病，而後自家之財富可保，况財富不是單獨的定形的存着，而是交遍的互亂的變化無常的融通於社會。如心　　役，則爲財奴，我能施財，則爲財主，以社會之財，用之於於會，方見智慧，保富法之用，仍當以人羣福利爲前提。</p>

<p>據財政部負責人昨對中央社記者所發表的談話：「……對於金融機關部分澈查未了事宜，查出果有非法投機囤積情事，仍常從嚴懲辦，務使囤戶歛跡，物價趨平，……」眞的，務使囤戶歛跡這一個表示，可以說是够堅決了。</p>
<p>自從政府當局洞悉滬市物價飛漲，純受投機囤積所致，於是乃有會同澈查的舉動。鍳於「來者可追」的一句話，巳過去的澈查結果，是否令人滿意，公論自在人心，姑不　述。現在我們所翹企以待的，就是要看繼續澈查囤積　成效如何。</p>
<p>根絕投機囤積最有效的幾個辦法，在上前是：（一）取締放款，（二）凍結倉庫，（三）淸查商店·自第一點言，自從當局進行澈查金融機關以後，惟一差强人意的收穫，便是各銀錢業肉此拒絕投機囤積性的借款，並同時收縮已政的賬款。果然，各囤積商大起恐　，紛紛出籠；各業市價，逐趨低落。自第二點言，目前當局旣正在調查各倉庫堆積存貨情形，則任何倉庫中的貨品，那應一律不許移動，並當嚴格　查貨物所有人，與其巳往的來踪去跡：如有囤積嫌疑，所有人應予法辦，貨物應予充公。自第三點言，近來商店拒絕售貨，固爲居心囤積的一個確證，而從事囤積的散戶，亦多以商店爲其尾閭。聽說許多新的商店之設立，不是爲著零售商品，而是爲著寄存囤貨，因爲向店寄存貨品，自表面上看來，原來不是不合法的！可是，這種商店的設立，正是囤積的烟幕，急應同時施行澈底的清查，並且提倡民衆的檢舉。</p>
<p>在繼結嚴查囤積的期間，我們願冉特別提出這麼幾點，無非希望澈查囤積，必要斬草除根，而最須提防的，便是「春風吹又生」的可能性。</p>

<p>去除團積居奇弊害的方策，惟有推進上海的生產活動，使物資的收買配給圓滑。總之。在求健全上海的經濟活動，使之明朗化，其對症下藥的辦法，就是對於做囤積而搗亂經濟界的投機份子，必須加以查辦。我們希望商統會的下層機構早日部署整齊，順利的運用，這也是完成上項目的之有效手段的一種。同時，關於取締囤積，相信國府尙有以充分　反省，與最大的英斷，再行出發的必要。</p>
<p>上次，國　下了道澈查積　命令，一般苦於物價高漲的民衆，莫不歡呼稱快。現在應該注意的一點，就是要澈底取締，我們站在民衆的立塲上不得不向國府提出以次兩點：希望國府對於取締囤積，旣沒有派閥鬭爭的作用，就應該出於至純至公的動機，以期安定民生，以　經濟復興，並且要用充分的勇氣，和縝密的準備，爲解決此項問題的再出發。同時，對於一部份人所稱國民政府內部扣囤積居奇事件有關，國府爲調查其是否屬實起見，應該採取一種妥善的措施。正如大家所說：「不能官而商，商而官。」此外，尙須公佈儲備銀行並無脫出正當業務範圍與貸放囤積資金的事實，俾　掃除羣疑，使民衆無策動反國府言論的餘地。此爲國時對於民衆所負的政治上資任。</p>

<h3 id="c64">市容 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 耶魯</p>
<p>在都市裏觸目所及的一切形象，者可稱之爲「市容」，市容的好壞，極與觀瞻有關，而且也會影響到風化問題的。在這所謂文化樞紐的上海，衆目昭彰之下，光怪陸離的市容，眞是美不勝收，其間有礙觀瞻，有傷風化的情形，固然「由來已久」，可是人有「於令　烈」之勢，無怪乎近來本埠當局又要整飭市容了。</p>
<p>當局巳在着手的工作是修築馬路淸除垃圾以及取締穢褻廣吿與無聊招紙。前者不但「以壯觀瞻」，而且路途中坦，可以安穩走路，垃圾淸除，可免烏烟瘴氣。至於後者，不但可以維持風化的良善，免得市民看到牆上花花綠綠的莫名其妙的招紙而目迷五色，甚至想入非非，而且紙張沒有這種浪費，於正當的文化需要上，也不無小補。</p>
<p>整飭市容的工作自然還有許多；僅　兩端，固能做到良好的成績，至少於市容也可煥然一新。其他像公共車輛上秩序的維持，隨地吐痰的禁止，雖然久爲當局所注意，但要得到好的效果，市民的合作，非常重要。不過　成問題者像車輛上的擁擠不堪以致秩序混亂，也可說是一半的原因由於交通工具的缺乏；而隨地吐痰的依然風行，也可以說是一半的原因由於市民的知識興公德心之缺乏。由缺乏到允足，在程度上是漸進的。</p>
<p>市容旣然是都市裏觸目所及的一切形象，那末市民的「面容」，當然也可屬於市容之一，因此我想到馬路上所見的人，不是「面帶愁容」便是「形容憔悴」；「容光渙發」的却很少見。這大槪除了「維他命」不足之外，也許還有別的原因。但這不是本文所論的範圍。</p>
<p>整飭市容辦得好，我想市民的面容，不久一定也可顯出喜氣揚揚起來。</p>

<p>— 王帥</p>
<p>「豆腐肉價錢」是不錯，可是比起目前的肉價錢到底使官得多，所以我說安分點吃吃豆腐吧！</p>
<p>提起了豆腐它倒是眞正的國粹營養品，它的發明還遠什二千年前，而發明者又是赫赫有名的漢朝淮南王劉安，有這樣的一個背景，這麼說，豆腐這東西也並不下賤。</p>
<p>它的原料就是黃豆，經過浸磨濾煮加滷，石膏這幾個過程後只待凝給就成了，這實在也是一種科學化的製造啊！</p>
<p>可惜豆腐店老板不會作廣吿，（倒有過豆乳的廣吿）他們最好效法時下　廣吿家，儘量的宣傳一下，恐怕他宣傳的文字價值要比說眞方賣假藥的要說得有勁些呢。　就從營養的價值上來說，植物蛋白不及動物蛋白，可是豆腐的營養價値也未必弱於肉類，每百公分中含有蛋白質七到八公分半，脂肪一到三公分半炭永化合物一到兩公分，且各種維生素都有，因爲加石膏故有鈣質，小兒多吃牙興骨頭可健康，而能正常的發　：孕婦多吃，可防牙齒裏面的鈣質　胎兒吸去造骨而腐壞，軟骨病肺結核病患者多吃，可以逐漸消滅病狀而正常，粗綫維不多，容易消化，對於病後小兒，胃腸病與行手術後病人，吃之最相宜，又沒有死　毒素，它是無核蛋白，不像有核蛋白能刺激腎肝等所以腎病心病水腫的人，還是由豆腐中攝取蛋白爲最善。</p>
<p>同豆腐一家門的還有豆乳豆乾豆　油豆腐與臭豆腐等，其功用大致差不多。</p>
<p>就其烹飪學上來說他的花樣又很多，舉幾個顯例豆腐燒山東大葱，味香而能健肺，豆腐燒黃魚，海味又算葷，與番茄榨菜可以燒酸辣湯，正好是開胃的。諸如此類，您儘可以多翻，可避免日久常食一樣菜的「厭」。</p>
<h3 id="c66">獨立精神 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 夢齡</p>
<p>打開窗戶，一片嫩綠面向着陽光，小烏追遂掠過正在造巢的鳥鴉，早已是春天了。</p>
<p>但春意固然盎然，我們並不是唱幾曲迎春歌，踏幾次靑，就算「春天是我們的了」那是小烏的作風，我們應學烏鴉，要有「獨立的精神，要用自己的力量造自己的巢。」</p>
<p>不錯，靑年時代是人生最有「活力」與「生氣」的時候，是靑年們往往誤解以爲憑了一時的情感，做無意　　事情，　算有「活力，」有生氣。</p>
<p>在職業界的靑年們最缺少的是「自動」的能力，　都昂着頭，袖着手，一切的事情要別人來做提綫工作，一拉一動，不拉不動，逃避責任，敷衍塞責，說起來是負有大志，但大志也得要由小處着手，方能達到目的啊！</p>
<p>至於在家庭中的靑年們呢？一方面固由於家長之溺愛，一飲一啄都替他安排好，以爲子弟沒有自動能力，與其敎他做　慢呑呑地不肯做，還不如替他做了吧；但不知這自　能力非培養不會成長。另一方面也得歸替於自己的懶惰，要明白家長是不會一生一世跟隨了智自己作事的。</p>
<p>再有靑年學生們呢？那自動精神也似乎跟隨了社會的不安，腐收，一同消沉了，先生站着，學生坐着、先生翻一頁書，學年也翻頁，明天交簿子了，明天冉說，至於教室打掃，宿舍之收拾，有校工，打鈴吃飯，打鈴睡覺，美其名曰「規律生活？」……十幾年的教育，造成一個標準懶東西（　然也有勤的）。</p>
<p>但我們究竟如何可以養成獨立的精神呢？只要能明白這獨立的精神對於一生的成就關係的話。我們要訓練必須從日常的小事着手，去找事做，有了事就該有安排計劃的能力，更要隨時檢討，要負責，對於善意的指正要虛心接受，這幾點不論是學生，是職業靑年都是最基本的獨立訓練，否則，即使有志獨立也是枉然的。</p>
<p>春天是我們的嗎？親愛的朋友們，我吿訴你一個消息，那隻巢在昨天已被烏鴉用了口含的一根一根的小樹枝造成了。</p>
<h3 id="c67">「幽默」與「譏諷」 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 蒙麟</p>
<p>幽默是「處世藝術」中　一個　要法門，一個有理智涵養的人，大都有幽默的技巧，如　能應用得法，常能使我們在解決人事上的各種問題時，獲得很美滿的效果。</p>
<p>幽默來的時候，不但是最聰敏的一刹　，同時也是最愉快的時候；最「率眞」的時候　不但幽默的人會表現出赤裸裸的情感，就是接受他的幽默感的人，也立刻會率眞表現眞情，如有幾個人苦悶地坐着時，頂盼望一個有幽默的人去烘暖這局面。幽默更是消滅緊張，瞻小，盛怒……。最有效的工具，</p>
<p>個人如富有幽默的個性，可以使常常擾得自己不安的一切驕傲，憂愁，憤恨不接近：而使自巳心寬體適。</p>
<p>卡爾登曾說『我時常覺得幽默是我們所吸取的空氣中的養氣那一種東西，牠創造而保持人類的歡笑，牠固然還能創製出別的更重要的東西，但以歡笑爲　先。』</p>
<p>至於爲什麼要「歡笑」，那不用去說明，人們需要的當然是愉快的生活，有了愉快的心理，方始　去創造事業。</p>
<p>但「幽默」雖好，過份尖刻了，就成了「譏諷」，「譏諷」運用得好，一方而固然可以使自已得勝，另一方面也能使別人因了你的「譏諷」而奮發有爲，以雪這恥辱。但我認爲譏諷是「友情」上的大敵，它絕對不能增加友誼，這似乎是根本違反了「幽默」的本意了。</p>
<p>所以與其幽默變成譏諷，還不如把幽默變成激勵而爲眞正的處世藝術，利用眞情的幽默去鼓　你的朋友，方始不會忠言逆耳。利用坦然的幽默感去處理事情，方能使理智淸澄，而在碰壁的時候，轉出一條新的路來達到目的。</p>
<p>爲了有眞正的幽默，譏諷是應當鄙棄的。</p>
<h3 id="c68">向上·營鑽 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>每一個人都有一顆强烈的進取心，都想獲得比現在更進一步的成就：本來啊，人的希望是無止境的，叔本華在他的論世界之苦惱裏有這幾句話「……人爲何等不知足的動物，每一欲望得到滿足時，即已播植新欲望之種，故凡個人之意志，其欲望殆無止極……。」</p>
<p>有了這些連續產生的希望，當然就要努力達到它，於是就有了二種方法去滿足進取心即「向上」與「營鑽」是也。</p>
<p>所謂「向上」，它是一種完全靠了目己的力量，克苦耐勞，爲了有崇高的理想，所以平日極力修養自己，鞭策自己，嚴肅自己的生活一絲不苟…當然，有志者事竟成，總有一天節爲人所賞識，讚美，和崇敬而得到應得的成功，實現應得的希望。</p>
<p>至於「營鑽」呢，那全不同了，像一條尖頭鰻似的，到處營鑽，只要一有機會便設法取巧，拍馬逢迎，尋路　，無孔不人，有洞皆鑽，凡可以引得上司歡心的，　所不用其極，見人面說人話，見鬼面說鬼話。一旦得以進身，立刻大搖大擺，至於甚麼同事朋友，早已拋諸腦後了……這種人是太習見了。</p>
<p>營鑽到底是一種極度卑鄙與可恥的行爲，有些「人氣」的人，當然是不屑爲之，當然的，眞正的成功要靠眞正的學識。光明大道較之營鑽豈可以同日語哉！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Supporting on One Hand, Urging on the Other <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Nanjing National Government is the only government of China at present, and it is the government leading the comprehensive peace between China and Japan. Since the unfortunate incident between China and Japan occurred, until Chairman Wang led the peace movement, the National Government has overcome all difficulties and gone through untold hardships to create today's situation. Especially in the past two years, the correct theory of the peace movement has been promoted, and the facts of its performance have made the people in the peace zone realize that the National Government's dedication to the peace movement is entirely to reduce the suffering of the people's lives, preserve the vitality of the country's revival, and build a new China in the future. We acknowledge that the leading figures of the National Government do indeed cherish lofty ideals for the country and the people and dedicate themselves to the peace movement. As the saying goes: "Strong grass is known in a gale, and loyal ministers are recognized in troubled times." Although dirt can temporarily obscure a pearl, it will eventually reveal its precious light one day. Therefore, those who participate in the peace movement do not need to dwell on formal rewards for their contributions. The historical records of later generations will never confuse black and white or obscure right and wrong.</p>
<p>We deduce the truth of things by using calm, objective, and rational judgment. Deduction confined to temporary emotions and one-sided views of interests often backfires. We believe that the peace movement advocated by the Chairman meets the needs of the times. Unless one has ulterior motives, we believe everyone agrees with it or acquiesces to it. The so-called "ulterior motives" can be rephrased as those who oppose the peace movement, and we can summarize them into three types:</p>
<p>First, the Chongqing regime. Their resistance war began with Chiang Kai-shek's political speculation, attempting to survive by luck and maintain his dictatorial regime. However, since it was political speculation, they had to rely on Britain and the United States, which led to a failed outcome. They then continued with reckless actions out of embarrassment and anger, engaging in an endless dragging war, disregarding the suffering of the people, and willingly being exploited by Britain and the United States, remaining unenlightened until death.</p>
<p>Second, the Communist Party. They blindly implement the policies of the First International, completely disregarding the interests of the motherland. On the one hand, they intensify the pressure on the Chongqing regime to drag the war to the end, and on the other hand, they actively expand their political power. They will not give up until the motherland and the people "perish together."</p>
<p>Third, the defeatists and wavering elements in the peace movement. On the one hand, they participate in the peace movement as a cover; on the other hand, they create various obstacles to the peace movement to hinder its progress. They hang up the signboard of the peace movement while engaging in activities to fish in troubled waters, such as using the advantages of their positions to engage in hoarding or engage in business. To put it bluntly, they will be afraid when they see genuine and comprehensive peace, and they will lose the opportunity to fish in troubled waters. Therefore, their opposition is real, and their participation is false. This kind of person is the biggest obstacle on the road to comprehensive peace and also the enemy of those who truly dedicate themselves to the peace movement.</p>
<p>Therefore, we sincerely hope that the National Government, in its efforts to realize comprehensive domestic peace, must clearly see through which types of people are the real opponents, and especially be careful to guard against defeatists and wavering elements in its own camp and thoroughly eliminate them. Otherwise, their potential will grow, and it is very likely that they will eventually become a source of trouble. We dare to point this out solemnly from the standpoint of loving and protecting the government.</p>
<p>Since the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9, it must promote comprehensive peace internally and cooperate with its ally Japan to defeat Britain and the United States externally. The government's responsibility has been increased by another layer, and the demands on the people have naturally been increased by another layer. Moreover, every move of the government is closely related to the people. The government's affairs are the people's affairs, and the people's affairs are also the government's affairs. The government's measures should take the people as a prerequisite, and only then can these measures gain the support of the people. In this way, the government and the people can be united as one, and only then can they exert their total strength to promote comprehensive peace internally and strive for victory in the war externally. In order to create a force that unites the government and the people, we need to support the government on one hand, fearing that we are not sincere enough; and urge the government on the other hand, fearing that we are not strict enough.</p>
<p>The responsibility of our journalistic circles is to communicate the opinions of the government and the people, to announce the government's intentions to the people on one hand, and to convey the public opinions of the people to the government on the other hand. Our proposals are nothing more than based on the opinions of the general public. If you think that our advocacy of "improving political institutions," "clarifying politics," "reforming personnel," "thoroughly investigating speculation and hoarding," "separating officials and merchants," and various political, economic, and social reform suggestions are opposing the government, this view is really unacceptable. We also deeply believe that the wise authorities will not only not have this view but will also value our well-intentioned suggestions.</p>
<p>Only those who truly dare to offer honest advice are those who truly support the government; only a government that can truly accept all kinds of advice is a government that is worthy of sincere support; and only the people who truly dare to urge the government are modern citizens who love the country. We will reiterate tirelessly: "Support the government on one hand, fearing that we are not sincere enough; and urge the government on the other hand, fearing that we are not strict enough." This is to inform those who generally misinterpret the meaning of "support" and "opposition."</p>

<h3 id="e2">Axis Forces with Favorable Terrain Determined to Hold Tunisia British Forces Launch General Offensive at Enfidaville Minefields and Traps Densely Laid Acknowledge Combat Difficulties <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) - It is learned here that after the British Eighth Army, commanded by Montgomery, launched a general offensive at Enfidaville on the southern end of the Tunisian front, the Tunisian front entered the decisive battle stage. British forces are now engaged in fierce fighting with the Axis forces commanded by the German General Rommel.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Allied News Agency correspondent Saito said: The final battle for Tunisia is now being fiercely fought by the British Eighth Army and the elite German Africa Corps commanded by Marshal Rommel. According to news received in Stockholm, the fierce fighting is currently taking place in the Enfidaville area. The British side once hinted that Marshal Rommel might follow the example of the Dunkirk campaign in the hope of preserving his troops, but now it is said that he is determined to fight to the end. British sources also acknowledged that the German army has dug trenches to hold fast and has a good supply of materials and ammunition. British sources said that General Montgomery's line extends eighty kilometers westward from Enfidaville, but also acknowledged that the entire area is full of German minefields, machine gun positions, tank traps, and other obstacles, and the German line's fierce artillery fire is also sufficient to show the German army's good equipment. London news acknowledges that it is very difficult to break into the defense lines from Tunis to Bizerte. Military circles in Stockholm said that no matter what the outcome of the Tunisian battle, it is generally a huge success for the German side, as the Axis forces have gained time to prepare for the Anglo-American attack on the continent. They pointed out that Europe is now an entire fortress, and eight million Axis soldiers are ready to depart.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to the Havas News Agency's military correspondent: The battle on the southern section of the Tunisian front continues to intensify. The right wing of General Montgomery's troops, after fierce fighting, has occupied Enfidaville and hopes to advance further north along the coast, but here the British army only advanced a few kilometers outside Enfidaville on Wednesday. The area of flat land between the coast and the mountains is not wide, and is still controlled by the Axis soldiers stationed in the highlands, so the right wing of the British Eighth Army cannot extend too far before its middle and left wings have made greater progress. But the middle and left wings of the British army have not been able to follow its right wing, and are now fighting on the southern and southwestern slopes, hoping to enter the mountains. As of Tuesday night, they had only gained a foothold in a few strongholds. The distance from there to the central area of the mountains is still far, and the central area is even higher and not easy to reach without great difficulty. The Axis forces there have extremely strong defensive positions and will resist step by step. The middle of General Montgomery is now fighting on the slopes, striving to enter the small waterway of the Dagaluna village inside the mountains, but has not succeeded. As of Wednesday night, the village was still in the hands of the Axis forces. The German army launched a fierce attack in the west, penetrating deep into the enemy's rear, so the British Eighth Army has very little chance to advance quickly. General Montgomery attempted to occupy the highlands northwest and west of Enfidaville. Since yesterday morning, the British and New Zealand troops have begun to attack. Because the terrain here makes it difficult to use tanks, the British army has used more artillery and aircraft. Extremely fierce fighting is still continuing. The French army, which was originally deployed at the junction of the British First Army and the Eighth Army, lost almost all the land it had gained last week due to a fierce counterattack by the German army. As of Wednesday, it was obviously resuming its advance towards Pont du Fahs and Djebel Zaghouan to slightly assist General Montgomery, but this move was powerless. On the western front of the Tunisian bridgehead, the British First Army made major preparations on Wednesday. General Anderson seemed to want to use this day to complete the thorough preparation for his large-scale new offensive, but the German army used strong forces to carry out reconnaissance attacks in the Mejez el Bab area, giving the British army a major hindrance. The British army was caught off guard and lost four artillery pieces and was captured in large numbers. After completing their mission, the German army withdrew safely. They prove that General Anderson has concentrated three British infantry divisions and one British tank division in the northern section of the western front, and in the second line there are American and French troops, so he also has superior manpower and material resources to prepare for a large-scale new attack in the future, only slightly inferior to what General Montgomery possesses.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Axis Elite Troops Headed to the Front Line Prepare to Fight to the Death with the British <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Before the anti-Axis forces launched their general offensive, they mobilized official propaganda organs to spread rumors that the Axis forces would repeat the tragedy of the Second Dunkirk and withdraw from the Tunisian front, but little did they know that after several discussions between German and Italian military officials, they had decided to defend the bridgehead of the African continent to the death. German General Rommel also pondered and exhausted his efforts, adopting the advantageous nature of internal line operations, determined to make the Tunisian front the Stalingrad of the Axis forces. According to a telegram from London, American Secretary of War, Patterson, strongly cautioned Americans not to be optimistic about the North African situation, saying that the anti-Axis forces would face even greater difficulties in fighting on the Tunisian front in the future and must endure great sacrifices. Another telegram from London said that the British newspapers also attached great importance to the North African situation and paid close attention to its trend. For example, the Daily Express reported that the British Eighth Army is currently engaged in fighting at Enfidaville and extending eighty kilometers west of it, but the Axis forces have laid mines and machine guns all over the area and dug trenches everywhere, and their ammunition is also very sufficient, so it is not easy for the British army to attack. Another telegram from London said that the British Eighth Army had broken through the Axis positions on the Enfidaville front, but the German authorities have denied this. It is heard that transportation from Sicily to the front has almost stopped. But the Axis forces are determined to fight to the death with the anti-Axis forces and have withdrawn all useless soldiers to the rear. The soldiers on the front line are all elite troops and have decided to defend their positions to the death on the line connecting the two ports of Tunis and Bizerte when necessary. Moreover, well-informed British sources unanimously believe that the entire European continent has now become a fortress, and the Axis forces' defenses are extremely solid. If the anti-Axis forces want to open up a second front in Europe, it is tantamount to fighting a tiger with bare hands or crossing a river without a boat. Everyone believes that the progress of the Tunisian front has a profound impact on the control of the Mediterranean Sea, and the progress of the situation in the past four or five weeks is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<h3 id="e4">German Army Surprise Attack Yields Results in the Atlas Mountains <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - It is reported that the Axis forces on the Tunisian front are still fighting bravely against about twice as many anti-Axis forces. According to the Axis military headquarters, in addition to achieving results in defensive battles on the 22nd, the Axis forces also launched a preemptive offensive west of Mejez el Bab and achieved considerable results. A summary of the war situation messages from various front lines is as follows: (1) On the southern front, the anti-Axis forces launched an unprecedented fierce offensive, especially the artillery's shelling was the most intense. On the 21st, as many as 50 shells fell in a small area alone. At present, the focus of the British Eighth Army's attack is the coastal area north of Enfidaville. In the area between Mejez el Bab and Bou Arada on the northern defensive line, the Axis forces carried out a large-scale surprise attack, advancing westward on the vast front line of stream valleys and hills in the Atlas Mountains, and have wiped out most of the enemy troops. Although the results of this battle achieved by the Axis forces have not yet been reported in detail, as far as it is known now, in addition to destroying six anti-Axis mortar positions, 11 British tanks, 4 armored reconnaissance vehicles have been intercepted and destroyed, and 400 anti-Axis soldiers have been captured, including 236 British soldiers. At the same time, in the Genolmans Road area, German shock troops also broke into the anti-Axis positions and captured 30 enemies, including a staff officer. In addition, the Axis air force closely cooperated with the ground forces on the entire Tunisian front. On the 21st, in air battles, 17 anti-Axis aircraft were shot down, including 4 bombers and several others. In addition, it also bombed advancing anti-Axis troops, barracks, and supply bases. It also raided the ports of Algiers and Philippeville. In the port of Algiers, a 5,000-ton transport ship was severely damaged. In addition, a 3,000-ton ship was also hit. At the same time, the port facilities and military supplies storage depots in the port of Philippeville were also bombed and caught fire.</p>

<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to the German military authorities: Since the start of the war in Libya in the autumn of 1940, up to April 28 of this year, the British army and other anti-Axis forces have lost a total of 4,500 tanks. It is heard that 2,734 of them were lost during the period from September 25, 1942, to April 18 of this year.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Stefani News Agency reported that news received here from the front in Tunisia confirms that the British Eighth Army has suffered significant losses in operations on the southern front. According to the Associated Press, ambulances are constantly shuttling between front-line first aid stations and rear field hospitals.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Army in Shanxi Launches New Operation Against Chongqing Army Overcoming Perilous Terrain of Taihang Mountains <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain front-line location of the Japanese army in the Taihang Mountains in southern Shanxi, the local Japanese military authorities issued a statement at 2:00 p.m. today regarding the new operation launched by the Japanese army in Shanxi. The gist of the statement was: The local Japanese army, in cooperation with neighboring units, began a new operation against the Chongqing Army's 24th Army Group in the Lingchuan, Linxian, and Linqi areas near the southern Taihang Mountains, and had completely surrounded the Chongqing Army on April 20 and is currently annihilating it. As for the current battle situation, the Japanese army is making smooth progress throughout. In this operation, the Shanxi Communist Suppression Army and various armed groups on the Chinese side also bravely cooperated with the Japanese army in a spirit of living and dying together. The Chongqing Army's 24th Army Group is commanded by Pang Bingxun and is mainly composed of three armies: the 27th Army, commanded by Liu Jin, the 40th Army, commanded by Ma Fawu, and the New 3rd Army, commanded by Sun Dianying, with a total force of about 82,000 men, and is the Chongqing Army's last effort in North China.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) According to a telegram from the southern Shanxi front on the 23rd: In order to eliminate Chiang Dingwen, "Commander-in-Chief" of the Chongqing's Ji-Cha War Zone, Pang Bingxun of the 24th Army Group, Ma Fawu of the 27th Army, and Sun Dianying of the New 5th Army, who are hiding in the Taihang Mountains on the border of the three provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan, the elite units of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army secretly began operations. The Chongqing Army, which had previously attempted to make trouble in the triangular area of Lingchuan (Shanxi Province), Lixian (Henan Province), and Linhong (Henan Province), was plotting to take action. After the Japanese army began the suppression operation on the 16th, it first destroyed the Chongqing County Government Army entrenched in the mountainous area north of Xiuwu Jiaozuo, and then advanced north, overcoming the natural danger of the Taihang Mountains, and sweeping away the remaining Chongqing Army in various places. On the 22nd, it arrived at the important points of the Henan-Shanxi provincial border. Approaching Linhong, the stronghold of the Chongqing 24th Army Group, it is now only a matter of time before it falls. At the same time, it is echoing each other with the Japanese army units advancing southward, and advancing forward. In addition, the Japanese Army Air Force also took advantage of the moonlight on the night of the 21st to attack the Chongqing Army, bombing the defeated and remnant Chongqing Army in a panic and firing fiercely with machine guns, making it easier for the Japanese ground forces to attack. As of the 23rd, the Japanese army has narrowed the encirclement and is attacking from all sides.</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Taihang Mountains Occupies Linqi</p>
<p>Beijing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - A telegram from a certain location of the Japanese army in the southern Taihang Mountains on the 23rd said that elite units of the Japanese army broke into Linqi, a stronghold of the Chongqing Army, on the 23rd, and are currently clearing out the remaining enemies. Linqi is the forward base of the Chongqing Army and is the key to clearing the security of the Beijing-Hankou Line.</p>
<p>Beiping, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The goal of the new operation launched by the Japanese army in North China is to annihilate the Chongqing Army in the Ji-Cha War Zone. Since the early summer of the 28th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese army has launched operations in the eastern part of Shanxi Province and near Luan and Zezhou with the aim of annihilating the Chongqing Army in that area. Subsequently, between the end of that year and the spring of the 29th year of the Republic of China, it launched a winter offensive operation, inflicting a major blow on the Chongqing Army. In May of the 30th year, the Japanese army launched the Central Plains Battle again. At that time, the Chongqing Army left behind 42,000 corpses and 29,000 people were captured. At the same time, all the strongholds of the Chongqing Army in North China were destroyed in succession. In June of the 31st year of the Republic of China, during the battle in the Shanxi-Hebei-Henan border area, the Japanese army again annihilated the Chongqing Army's 27th Army. In this battle, Zuo Heng, the deputy chief of staff of the Chongqing Army's 18th Army Group, was also killed in battle, and Liu Yuexiang, the commander of the newly formed 5th Army's Provisional 3rd Division, also joined the peace movement. All the above suppression operations have thwarted the Chongqing Army's attempts. However, the main purpose of the Japanese army's operation this time is to annihilate the Chongqing Army's 24th Army Group. Although the Chongqing side lacks both manpower and materials, it has made great efforts to train this army.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - After Zhang Xingbing's remnant troops of the Chongqing guerrillas lurking in the Dongtai area were defeated by the 35th Division Commander of the National Army, Zhao Junshan, in cooperation with friendly forces, the security of the Dongtai area was restored. The general public, who had been suffering under the heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies of the Chongqing side, were able to rest and live in peace, and the local area gradually showed signs of revival.</p>
<p>Weekly War Situation of Japanese Garrison</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Garrison in China released a weekly war situation report on April 23, stating: The Communist bandits in various provinces of North China fear that the new policy of the Japanese side towards China will gradually develop and increase obstacles, so they are trying to disrupt the morale of the people in the security areas, especially for the Chinese organizations, focusing their strategies and making every effort to destroy them. However, the Chinese side's awareness is gradually increasing, and the Communist bandits' attempts have been defeated and shaken. Among the prisoners captured by the Japanese army in March, there were 1,834 Chongqing soldiers, and the number of bandits was more than twice as many, compared to the average difference of only one or two times in January and February. This shows that the number of Communist prisoners has gradually increased. Moreover, the number of prisoners and those who surrendered in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has also increased, so the theory of resistance war has gradually collapsed due to the theory of peace. The new policy of the Japanese side has gradually made the people understand. However, on the other hand, the troops under the command of the deputy commander of the Chongqing-Lu-Su War Zone were captured by the Communist bandits, and in the southern Lishui area of Jiangnan, there were even clashes between the Chongqing Army and the New Fourth Army. At this time, the Japanese Commander-in-Chief Hata inspected various places in North China and pointed out that in addition to determining the responsibility for combat and defense, all rebellious activities under the rule of the National Government should be suppressed. At present, a vigorous operation is being launched in Shanxi, and the future development of the situation in that area is worth watching.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Minister Chen's Response to Reporters: Detailed Discussion of Various Domestic Policy Issues <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Central News Agency reporter recently visited Minister of the Interior Chen Qun and was granted an audience. Minister Chen responded to the reporter's inquiries on various domestic policy issues, as follows:</p>
<p>Question: After China's entry into the war, what is the focus of domestic policy?</p>
<p>Answer: Since China's entry into the war, the focus of the Ministry of the Interior's work has been to ensure public security. Therefore, police training is a top priority. Since the National Government's entry into the war, local security has become entirely our own responsibility. Thus, it is necessary to further train the police and strengthen local forces so they can bear practical responsibility. Currently, local police are directly responsible to provincial and municipal governments and are also supervised by the Ministry of the Interior, resulting in inconsistent training policies and educational standards. Furthermore, one significant shortcoming is the police's inadequate quality. The Ministry of the Interior, bearing the responsibility of supervising the police, will strive to improve this aspect in the future.</p>
<p>Question: May I ask for your views on promoting clean governance?</p>
<p>Answer: Clean governance is a necessary condition for political reform. If those in power are not incorruptible, then politics will inevitably be dark, and all national construction will be out of the question. Senior government officials have already held meetings on integrity, but these are only to exchange individual opinions. If all government officials practice integrity diligently, clean governance will certainly be achieved, and the people will enjoy prosperity and happiness.</p>
<p>Question: The government has recently dispatched personnel to punish hoarding. What are the Minister's observations on the results?</p>
<p>Answer: The practice of hoarding and speculation affects people's livelihoods and the national economy to a great extent. Chairman Wang decisively issued an order to severely investigate and punish such behavior to appease the public and prevent future occurrences. However, to sanction those involved in hoarding and speculation, one must resolutely disregard personal connections and avoid any leniency. As long as a few individuals who disrupt the market are severely investigated and punished, I believe no one will dare to test the law again.</p>
<p>Question: Is there room for improvement in the current implementation of partial material rationing?</p>
<p>Answer: The material rationing system must be balanced, adhering to the principle of not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality. The most ideal situation is when the quantity of materials can meet supply and demand. Even if the quantity of materials is not sufficient, the needs of the general public must be prioritized. We must show compassion for the common people and also consider the hardships of civil servants. Relevant authorities are currently planning measures.</p>
<p>Question: What are your opinions on youth training?</p>
<p>Answer: Youth training is organized by the New Citizen Movement Promotion Committee. I greatly admire those who are in charge. However, there is a simple psychological test for youth training, which is to make the youth listen to instructions and obey orders. If we order all the youth in the country to shave their heads, and see if they are willing to obey, that would be telling. All the students at Zhengshi Middle School, which I run, have shaved their heads. In friendly country Japan, youths in middle school, university preparatory courses, or higher schools all shave their heads. Before leaving university or starting work in society, they rarely keep long hair. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen their physical fitness and implement training, so that everyone is full of energy and physically strong. Only then can they serve properly, and not fail the original intention of training. Being able to do this would be considered an initial success of the training.</p>

In the afternoon, the delegation visited friendly agencies. After a dinner hosted by the provincial government, they left Suzhou for Shanghai at approximately 7:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Japanese Major General Tanihagi's Speech: New Trends in World War - The Greater East Asia War Shows Japanese Military Superiority, Creating the Most Glorious Page in Military History <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a telephone report from Sendai, Major General Tanihagi, head of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, gave a public speech at the Sendai Public Hall at 6 PM this afternoon. Entitled "Completing the Greater East Asia War," he explained the great military achievements of the Japanese army in combat and construction in the vast Greater East Asia region. He also pointed out that the United Kingdom and the United States now have great fear of Japan. Finally, he told the 100 million citizens of Japan to make further efforts with the belief of certain victory to complete the Greater East Asia War. The gist of the speech is recorded as follows: Recently, the authorities of the United Kingdom and the United States, in order to boost their morale, have created a false impression among their people. Therefore, they have repeatedly discussed issues such as peace and the post-war governance. Such remarks are not only pie in the sky, but also premature and therefore laughable. However, it also reveals their selfish and self-serving doctrine and exposes the United States' ambition to dominate the world. During the Southern Operation, the US military inflicted cruel punishment on wounded Japanese soldiers and abused Japanese residents everywhere. Their most blatant violations of international law and disregard for humanity were the daytime attacks on Japanese Red Cross ships. Furthermore, the British army repeatedly drove other ethnic groups into battle during operations, using their flesh and blood to resist ruthless bullets and protect their own safety. Moreover, they insulted civilians, plundered food, and so on, all of which exposed their evil behavior. As for the new trends in this World War, they can be divided into three points:</p>
<p>(1) Expansion of the Battlefield: This war is a decisive battle between two national groups with completely different worldviews. At present, apart from some neutral countries and Japan, which maintains a neutral relationship with the Soviet Union, the world can be roughly divided into two major parts: the Axis and the Anti-Axis. At the same time, the two groups are continuing to fight each other. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army launched a great operation to destroy the British and American strongholds in East Asia in a vast area, and the overall situation has now been determined.</p>
<p>(2) Speed of Operations: Recalling the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese army began operations from the Liaodong Peninsula and the Yalu River area in late July, and the Battle of Fengtian was held in February of the following year, lasting about ten months. During this time, the Japanese army only traveled four hundred kilometers. However, in this Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army's Yamashita Corps advanced more than a thousand kilometers in the Malay Peninsula in just two months, showing that the speed of operations in this war is much faster than in the past.</p>
<p>(3) Scientification of the Military: For example, in the recent European war, the German army's capture of Poland and the battle in northern France were both blitzkriegs by German mechanized units. For example, when the Japanese army attacked the Sumatra giant port, it used paratrooper units and succeeded in one fell swoop. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the United Kingdom and the United States have fully felt the power of the Japanese military. The most notable example is the operation in the South Pacific from August last year to February this year, and the annihilation battle at the Mashu River in northern Nissi this March. Furthermore, in order to gain sufficient time, the Japanese army sent covering troops to advance to Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands and various parts of New Guinea Island from August last year to February this year in order to build land bases and strategic strongholds in the occupied areas of the South. The brave battles of the covering troops really created the most glorious page in military history. The "Divine Warrior" characteristics and martial spirit of the Japanese army made the arrogant American army fearful and trembling. At the same time, the United States also recognized that their superiority has been fundamentally shaken. Furthermore, American public opinion also unanimously stated that it is unfavorable for the American military to fight against the brave Japanese army. All aspects of the United States recognize that it is difficult for the American military to achieve the final goal by capturing countless islands in the Pacific one by one. Because if the American military intends to reach Tokyo, it still needs a hundred years, and it needs hundreds of times more troops than the American military today. Furthermore, the British Indian army recently attempted to recover Masi River in Burma and began to attack, but its five brigades and one detachment were completely annihilated by the Japanese army. The other three brigades also fled in all directions, not only collapsing, but also losing their combat power. Therefore, the Anti-Axis forces are increasingly terrified of the Japanese army. Although the future of the Greater East Asia War is still distant and difficult, victory is already firmly in our hands. In short, this war is a sacred war of justice for the heavens and the earth, and all Japanese citizens should work hard to complete the war with a spirit of resolve to die.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Japanese Aircraft Assault New Guinea by Moonlight: Increased Japanese Air Power in the Pacific: US and Australian Authorities Are Anxious <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a report from Melbourne: The Southwest Pacific Headquarters of General MacArthur announced yesterday that on the evening of April 21st, Japanese aircraft took advantage of the full moon to attack the Anti-Axis forces' positions in southeastern New Guinea again.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a special report from the capital of Argentina carried in the evening edition of the Yomiuri-Hochi newspaper on the 22nd, the recent continuous offensives by the Japanese Air Force in the Southwest Pacific have caused great embarrassment to the US and Australian military authorities. All sectors in the United States and Australia have also unanimously demanded that the authorities re-examine the war situation in the Southwest Pacific. MacArthur has also had friction with US Navy Secretary Knox over this matter. It is reported that Admiral Yarnall, former commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, mentioned the war situation in the Southwest Pacific at a naval gathering in Princeton on the 21st of this month, strongly stating that the Japanese army's position in the Southwest Pacific is no longer something that the US Navy can break through with its own power. He meant that the Japanese army's attitude of securing the Southwest Pacific has great significance, and that it has already been able to determine the fate of the Pacific countries for the next fifty years. If the Japanese army is not driven out of China now, it may be difficult for the US Navy to annihilate the Japanese army on its own. But judging from the current situation, because the Anti-Axis forces have no effective offensive in China, the United States should extend the war as much as possible. During this period, it should use air force or submarines to fight against Japan. The great offensive adopted by the Japanese army in the Pacific is unprecedented in military history. During this time, the United States must use all means to hinder Japan from building economic countries in China, the Philippines, India, the Malay Peninsula, the East Indies, Australia, and New Zealand. Furthermore, Australian Ambassador to the United States, Edward, also made a speech in New York on the 20th, briefly stating that Australia is now directly threatened by the Japanese army. If the United States does not start an offensive now, Australia may never exist. Furthermore, the American Central Daily News also published a commentary criticizing Admiral Yarnall's views as being too weak, and advocating to start an offensive immediately. It meant that Japan's victory will dominate world history for a long time, and the United States should eliminate any difficulties and give Japan a major blow. In addition, the Chongqing Central Daily News also reported that it recognized that American Navy Admiral Yarnall had lived in China for a long time and was known as an expert on East Asia. It now also points out that the Anti-Axis forces have no effective offensive in China, which is enough to expose the unreliability of the United States in strengthening its aid to Chongqing. It meant that the Anti-Axis forces should immediately take offensive action against Japan. If Japan uses preemptive means to attack Asia, then the Anti-Axis forces will not only lose the opportunity to attack Japan, but also increase the possibility of being attacked by Japan. All the opinions that have been raised because of Yarnall's views are enough to show the confusion of the nurturing country in guiding the operation in the Southwest Pacific.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - It has been learned that US Special Envoy to India, Phillips, will return to Washington at the end of this month to report on the situation in India. It is said that he arrived in New Delhi on the 22nd and is staying at the Governor-General's residence, planning to stay for several days and hold a frank discussion with the Indian Governor-General. According to reports from the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" and the "Calcutta Gazette," it is rumored that the US government and the British government seem to be mediating to break the deadlock in India. However, the US government's superficial interference in the Indian issue has caused dissatisfaction among the British. Therefore, it will informally propose a compromise plan to the British government. At the same time, the Chongqing government is also seeking to approach the leaders of the Indian National Congress in order to break the deadlock in India.</p>

<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced on the 22nd: 39 British aircraft were shot down by German forces during the British air raid on Stettin and Rostock in northern Germany on the night of the 20th.</p>
<p>Berlin, 32nd (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently published an article in this week's German "Willingness Weekly" entitled "The British Air Raids on Germany." He strongly stated that German aircraft will use retaliatory measures to bomb Britain in the future, with the general idea being: I recently went to Essen to inspect the areas that were severely damaged by British air raids. I met with the affected citizens, and they were all silent, believing that it was most glorious for the country to endure sacrifices. At the same time, they hated the enemy's atrocities to the bone, and they were even more convinced that the final victory must belong to us. The enemy thinks that blind bombing can discourage the German people, which is purely a mistake. Germany has now strengthened submarine warfare and will use it to counter blind bombing by enemy aircraft. The losses suffered by Britain due to commercial destruction warfare are actually greater than the damage suffered by Germany due to air raids. However, submarine warfare does not target innocent women and children. Germany's response to air raids is not only defensive but is also seeking active measures. The German government and people will express their anger about the blind bombing by British aircraft at an appropriate time because Germany will definitely retaliate sooner or later.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to London news, several British Members of Parliament yesterday expressed fierce criticism of the anti-Indian laws enacted by South Africa on Wednesday and frequently questioned Secretary of State for India Amery. The MPs demanded that the British government explain the bill proposed by the South African government and passed by the South African Parliament to prohibit Indians in Natal and Transvaal from purchasing real estate. Labour MP Sloan claimed that Indians are still members of the British Empire, and he wanted to know whether Secretary Amery, having praised the high quality of Indian troops fighting, had therefore made any representations to the South African government on this matter. Labour MP Sorensen also raised this matter, and Labour MP Ammon joined the protest, saying, "I have just received a protest telegram from the Natal Indian Association, which may be what the Minister wants to know." When the MPs shouted "Answer!" Amery only said that the matter had been discussed by the Indian government and the South African government. At this point, MP Sloan stood up and declared that since Secretary Amery could not provide a satisfactory answer, he would raise the matter again at an appropriate time after the parliamentary recess.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The South African Federal Parliament is currently deliberating a bill prohibiting Indians in the two states of Transvaal and Natal from purchasing land. This has a major impact on India, which is currently undergoing a fierce anti-British movement. The President of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah, has stated that if the South African Federal Parliament passes the bill, the relationship between India and the South African Federation will be seriously affected. The National Congress Party has an even stronger attitude, fiercely attacking the South African Federal Government, saying that Indian troops are currently fighting the Axis forces on the Tunisian front to protect the safety of the people of the South African Federation. However, the Federal Government has presented this bill to Parliament to exclude Indians. This type of law clearly has a racial discrimination character. Furthermore, a special telegram from "The Times" on the 17th reported on Indian disturbances related to the bill, stating that India is extremely concerned about the progress of the South African Federal Parliament's deliberation of the land bill, and all levels of Indian people have expressed opposition to the South African Federation. The general public in South Africa has already strongly criticized Indians, and even without this law, it is almost impossible for Indians to buy land in South Africa. Therefore, Indians believe that the introduction of this bill is not based on economic reasons as claimed by the South African authorities but is clearly based on racial discrimination.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Establishing a Unified War and Production Posture (I) Striving to Increase Production and Seize the Initiative in the War <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Speech by Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, Sato</p>
<p>Starting at 9:00 AM on April 14th, at the Second Army Technical Research Conference held at the Ministry of the Army, Major General Sato Kenryo, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, gave a speech to the 1,300 Army technical personnel in attendance, calling for the rise of scientists and engineers. The tasks undertaken by science and technology in the process of carrying out the war in the future are summarized in the following three points: (1) a leap in production, (2) an improvement and leap in war materials, and (3) the completion of measures that can fatally wound the United States and Britain. The following is the full text of the speech:</p>
<p>Up to today, Japan's operations have focused on speed, adopting an absolute offensive to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and consolidate the foothold for the decisive battle against the United States and Britain. In wars between all strong countries, if one side continues its offensive, it will eventually use all its strength to carry out its offensive at any time. On the other hand, the other party is forced to retreat, supplement and restore its combat power near its base of operations. Thus, the location of offense and defense changes from time to time. After each offensive and defensive battle, the location of the war changes once. This is the convention in war. Historical records prove this without fail. Even on the Egyptian front, we can witness this reality.</p>
<p>Although Japan has continued to adopt an unparalleled and rapid offensive on the vast continent and ocean of thousands of kilometers, the offensive and defensive situation has not changed to this day. We still maintain the offensive without ever falling into the defensive. Strategically, the whole world is amazed by this. However, recently, the enemy seems to have taken a stand before our pursuit. In the future, we must continue to advance. Therefore, in order to firmly grasp the initiative in the war, in addition to issues such as mental strength and military tactics, the key to victory or defeat lies in the issue of production capacity. Of course, the absolute amount of production capacity of the enemy and ourselves is greater on the enemy's side. However, as Prime Minister Tojo said in his policy speech: Since the start of the war, Japan has ensured the offensive, using the great value of strategic strongholds to increase our production capacity and quickly improve this production capacity so that it can counter the enemy's production capacity. This is an absolute task that will determine the future of the war.</p>
<p>Japan's original military resources have never been self-sufficient. Therefore, the development and construction of newly occupied areas are, needless to say, extremely important for future production. That is, ensuring and strengthening the current production posture of China, Manchuria, and the southern regions is the lifeblood of Japan's future production. However, this production posture must be consistent with the strategic posture of the decisive battle foundation of the Greater East Asia War. In other words, if the current strategic posture is unfavorable, it will inevitably destroy the production posture. Conversely, if the production posture is not solid, it will also hinder the strategic posture. In short, ensuring the unity of this war and production posture is an absolute issue in Japan's war guidance in the future.</p>
<p>There are two enemies who disrupt the unity of this war and production posture: one is aircraft, and the other is submarines. Today, aircraft have great power in combat. Especially in the ocean, aircraft can be said to be the throne of combat. This is evident from the past combat experience. Especially in the South Pacific, our traditional idea was that the battle on land was the army, and the battle at sea was the navy. The idea of separate operations by the army and navy must now be completely changed.</p>
<p>On the continent, the power of aircraft cannot be regarded as absolute. Therefore, there is no major change from the previous combat state. At sea, both sides set up air bases on the scattered islands, regarding this air base network as the backbone of the combat organization, and using it as the center to exert the integrated combat power of the army, navy, and air force. The increased combat power of aircraft has created a situation where the air base network is the backbone of the combat organization. He who has no air supremacy has no sea supremacy. How true are these words!</p>
<p>Therefore, at the beginning of the battle, the army and navy must first jointly capture the islands in the ocean and set them up as air bases, build solid defensive fortifications to defend them, and use them as supply bases. Air combat is the main role in the battle, and the battle of warships and the battle of land soldiers are carried out in parallel with air combat. Here, if there is a significant advantage or disadvantage in the air force between the enemy and ourselves, then the superior party uses its surplus power to destroy the other party's rear maritime transportation.</p>
<p>Therefore, the situation of the battle changes to a war between aircraft occupying the throne in battle and transport ships that are weak and powerless in battle. As a result, in addition to causing difficulties in the supply of the front-line troops, it also hinders the production posture due to the loss of shipping capacity.</p>
<p>Submarines are naturally also a major enemy of transport ships. The United States and Britain are constantly complaining about the Axis submarines. Although the power of aircraft has not yet occupied the absolute throne in land battles, China is often regarded as the enemy's air base, used to bomb our mainland and destroy maritime transportation. We take preemptive action to destroy them and strictly defend the mainland's air. These measures are important issues in ensuring our production posture.</p>
<p>From this point of view, in order to establish the two postures of war and production, the increased production of aircraft, which occupy the throne in battle, is an absolute necessity. If air combat power is superior, in addition to obtaining air supremacy and other strategic advantages, it can also use its surplus power to bypass the enemy's rear and destroy its transport ships,打击其給養與生產力. If air combat power is in an inferior position, then the above-mentioned situations are exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>The shipbuilding problem is the second most important problem in production expansion after aircraft. There must be mass production in shipbuilding, and in order to deal with aircraft and submarines, especially in order to replenish supplies from enemy aircraft attacks to the front line, in addition to increasing shipping capacity, there must be special research. Therefore, our country's increased production is first aircraft (the main weapons of the army and navy are of course included and are not an exception here); second is ships, followed by aluminum, iron, and coal, which are related to the increase in other military production. The wartime special case law for control of the air in the previous period also specifically proposed these five major industries.</p>
<p>Since last year, the government, led by the Prime Minister, has discussed all policies, and all political and administrative power has been concentrated on the point of production expansion. The officials and people also understand the government's intentions and work together to produce, and the effect has exceeded expectations.</p>
<p>In this year, the mass production of shipbuilding is gradually on track, and methods such as building wooden ships and salvaging sunken ships are actively carried out. Therefore, although the damage to ships is more intense than last year, the increase in ships can be expected in the near future. Similarly, aircraft, aluminum, iron, and coal have all achieved great success due to the consistent efforts of officials and people. This situation can of course be maintained in this year, and we hope to strengthen it even more.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to the characteristics of our country's production posture, which is the combination of the southern regions and China, Manchuria, and the Japanese mainland. That is, the key to production depends on maritime transportation capacity. The saving of shipping capacity must be limited to the increase in food products such as rice, other military-related products, and daily necessities for the people. In this way, we can free up shipping capacity to increase the production of the five major industries and other important industries, and we can increase combat power and strengthen the strategic posture and production posture. The people who are engaged in the production of military-related products and daily necessities, that is, the soldiers in the production camp, as well as other people who are not in this camp, and even in the family, should not only save gas, electricity, and coal, but also save everything as much as possible. Therefore, saving production resources and the shipping capacity for transporting these resources is also a part of production increase.</p>
<p>Since the autumn of last year, thanks to the consistent efforts of the government, officials, and people, the effect has been great and gratifying. And this long-term war of attrition, which is one of the characteristics of this war, can therefore be competent.</p>
<p>In the past, after each war, weapons underwent a degree of improvement and innovation. Before this war, general weapons, based on the previous European War as a standard, can be roughly divided into three types: pre-war type, war type, and post-war type. The changes in weapons in this war are very different from the past. It can be said that they are changing with each passing day. Now, let's take an example to see how the progress of weapons in this war affects the situation of the war.</p>
<p>In the North African war last summer, the Italian army conquered Tobruk overnight and drove straight into Egypt, with Alexandria in sight. The great success of this campaign was due to the Italian army's invention of weapons for warfare and the new improvement of the air-conditioning equipment of the tanks. The unexpected power of the Soviet army's attacks this winter was mainly due to the preparation of the Soviet army's tanks and anti-tank weapons, and the thorough training in the use of these mechanized units. Recently, a kind of machine uses ultra-short waves to predict the approach of enemy submarines and aircraft. Because it restricts the range of submarine activities, the approach of aircraft can be predicted hundreds of kilometers in advance, so the way to avoid its surprise attack has also improved. This kind of alarm can now even calculate the direction and distance of the aircraft and is connected to the anti-aircraft guns. It can shoot at the aircraft without seeing it, regardless of fog, clouds, or at night.</p>

<p>The Public Concession Police Headquarters originally scheduled to hold the annual grand parade of the forces of the police stations in various districts and other auxiliary organizations established by the police affairs department at the racecourse at 2:00 PM yesterday (23rd). Okazaki Katsuo, Chairman of the Board, was scheduled to serve as the inspecting officer, and Police Chief Goto and Deputy Police Chief, among others, were to participate. Senior officers of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai, as well as relevant officials of the French Concession police affairs department, were also invited to attend the ceremony. However, due to the rain, it could not be held as scheduled. It has now been changed to 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month, still to be held at the racecourse.</p>

<p>As May is approaching in the blink of an eye, the City Police Bureau believes that it is usually an eventful month. In order to ensure the security of the urban area, the bureau is deeply concerned that petty criminals may take the opportunity to harm the local area and disrupt public order. Yesterday, it specially issued an order to all subordinate police stations and the detective corps to be strictly vigilant and take precautions to ensure safety. The French Concession police department will also begin to be vigilant, especially at the various open iron gates in the Hua-Fa Viyun area. Police officers from both the Chinese and French police departments will also conduct searches of pedestrians and vehicles to jointly protect public order.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Public Concession Tramway Company implemented express bus service on the first of this month, the efficiency of tram operation has been improved. It is learned that the tram company authorities have recently adjusted some bus stops. As of yesterday, the Zhaofeng Village stop of the Route 20 trolleybus has been completely abolished. (The tram company designated it as an express bus stop on April 1st, meaning trams would still stop there daily from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM). It is also learned that the Yan'an Road stop of the Route 20 trolleybus has also been moved from the entrance of Zhaofeng Park to diagonally opposite the Nuit de Paris Café (New Village Entrance) on Yuyuan Road. However, its starting point remains at the entrance of Zhaofeng Park. The reason the tram company has designated two different locations for the terminus and starting point of the tram stop is to avoid excessive crowding when passengers board and alight. Additionally, the Yidingpan Road stop of the Route 20 trolleybus has also been slightly moved.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Anti-British and American Association Reorganized – Taken Over and Managed by the Ministry of Social Welfare – National Government Values Past Work <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-British and American Association in this city was established in the spring of last year. For a year, it has spared no effort in carrying out anti-British and American propaganda and public welfare work. It has been learned that the association will be reorganized in the near future. A reporter made a special visit to the person in charge of the association yesterday. According to the representative, the organization is purely a non-governmental group. For the past year, it has engaged in the anti-British and American movement from this position, and, thanks to the support of various parties, it has fortunately achieved a certain scale. Now that the National Government has clearly declared war on Britain and the United States, the association's anti-British and American stance has evolved from a popular movement into national policy. The association’s colleagues should henceforth fulfill this national policy as citizens. Therefore, a petition was submitted to the Central Ministry of Social Welfare to incorporate the work of the association into the government structure to unify authority. Minister Ding approved the request and dispatched Vice Minister Jian Jianwu to take over the association. Jian has arrived in Shanghai to handle the takeover. The association’s executives and staff believe that the anti-British and American enlightenment movement has come to an end, and they are grateful for the central government's recognition of the association’s past work and the responsibilities entrusted to them. Therefore, Secretary Wang Boyong, Director of Public Relations Li Guohua, Director of Organization Xia Huanxin, Director of Propaganda Liu Hanru, and Chief of General Affairs Yang Zhengzhi jointly petitioned the Ministry of Social Affairs to resign from their respective concurrent positions, so that they can each engage in anti-British and American work in their respective capacities. This has been approved, for which they are deeply grateful. Therefore, the association's current organization will be reorganized by the end of this month. From May 1st onwards, Vice Minister Jian will be in charge of everything. Although colleagues will formally leave the association, they pledge to adhere to their original aspirations regarding the overall national policy of anti-British and Americanism, earnestly implementing it in their respective positions until the complete eradication of British and American forces and the full achievement of the goals of the Greater East Asia War. Finally, the person in charge of the association also stated that the association's liaison officer, Mr. Toshisuke Yoshida, will also cease his liaison work from May 1st.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Pawnshop Guild has issued a notice to all member firms stating that in the past, due to a lack of understanding of the stamp duty law, the stamp duty rates affixed to pawn tickets have been inconsistent, often resulting in unwarranted fines. The guild has now thoroughly investigated the stamp duty law and determined that pawn tickets should be affixed with stamps as stipulated in Item 19 of the tax rate table under the heading of loan or mortgage documents. That is, a stamp duty of 4 cents is affixed per 100 yuan, and any amount less than 100 yuan is also counted as 100 yuan (amounts less than 10 yuan are exempt from stamping). For example, 4 cents are affixed for amounts from 10 yuan up to 100 yuan, 8 cents are affixed for amounts from 100 yuan and above up to 200 yuan, and 12 cents are affixed for amounts from 200 yuan and above up to 300 yuan, and so on. All firms should comply to avoid penalties.</p>

<p>The German-language Far Eastern Daily News reports: On the 26th of this month, the German Equestrian Club in this city will hold an equestrian competition at the Hongqiao Racecourse. The club has a total of 72 horses of various sizes, available for use by 67 male and female riders. It is said that riding enthusiasts have created a square, divided into several levels, to allow horses and riders of different levels to practice riding at designated times. For the sake of order and uniformity, the competition will be divided into elementary and advanced levels, based on the height of the obstacles to be jumped during riding. The difference in height between the two levels is 10 centimeters, which will be determined by the training supervisor after careful consideration of the usual training results. The competition will begin at 2:30 PM and end around 6:20 PM. The racecourse and jumping track are separated from the audience to avoid danger. However, to prevent any accidents, children under the age of six are prohibited. Furthermore, the audience should remain silent during the jumping events. Therefore, sensitive dogs should also not be brought to avoid causing disturbance. The location also features the Chanson Garden, with lush green grass and a riot of colors, making it a perfect embellishment for the grand occasion. Attending audience members can both broaden their horizons and escape the hustle and bustle of the city. Tickets are priced at 20 yuan per ticket, and student tickets are 10 yuan.

<h3 id="e53">Discussion on the Application of the "Protecting Wealth" Method (2) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The original meaning of the "Protecting Wealth" method has been explained in detail by Elder Layman Nie Yuntai, referring to the theory of waxing and waning of the natural order and the principle of cause and effect in Buddhism. The Nie family history has the beautiful story of "Mount Heng showing its spirit, Nanhai extending its blessings, celebrating the 70th birthday, and the seven sons becoming famous", which is a reward for "Mr. Yue Shan's medical assistance and charity". As the Great Learning says, "The benevolent develop themselves with wealth, while the unkind develop wealth with themselves." Doing good deeds and accumulating virtue can be a model for colleagues in the medical field.</p>
<p>No one can avoid the suffering of birth, old age, sickness, and death, and medicine is related to nourishing life, preventing aging, treating diseases, and saving lives. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with everything with benevolence and kindness. Those who practiced medicine in ancient times said, "No one sees the preparation, but Heaven knows the intention." They helped people according to fate, and offered medicine on the first and fifteenth of the lunar month. Even today, traditional Chinese medicine stores still offer special treatment on those days, which is a remnant of the past. As for wanting to be like Han Kang, selling medicine in the Chang'an market for more than thirty years without changing the price, it is no longer possible.</p>
<p>There is no other way to protect wealth: "Great wealth is determined by Heaven, small wealth is determined by man." Wealth made by man is selfish, while natural wealth is public. Material wealth is only flaunted at the time, while spiritual wealth can leave a lasting legacy. Therefore, morality and writing, merit and career, are all related to gold, jade, jewelry, fields, and houses. Today, those engaged in mental labor, such as teachers and honest officials, may have read thousands of books but cannot afford a few liters of rice or a few feet of cloth, and their poverty can be imagined. However, Yan Hui ate only a basket of rice and drank only a ladle of water, which others could not bear, but Confucius praised his virtue. Everyone has their own aspirations, and they enjoy spiritual happiness and do not want to possess material wealth. The learning of Laozi in our country is "non-action and guarding truth", and the Buddha's teaching is "observing emptiness and wonderful existence", not coveting man-made wealth but wanting to protect natural wealth.</p>
<p>Scientific methods are nothing more than following the principles of nature and exhausting human efforts to create all kinds of wealth. For example, Edison invented the light bulb, Watt invented the steam engine, and Stephenson invented the train, which increased the wealth of the world immeasurably. However, the application of scientific methods to various enterprises, such as the organization of cooperatives, where "everyone is for me, and I am for everyone", can alleviate the difficulties of public life. Or, such as the joint operation of insurance companies, "preventing losses through statistics and sharing risks through mutual assistance", can protect against all kinds of unexpected disasters. All of these have the meaning of protecting wealth.</p>
<p>Science is extremely broad and all-encompassing. The so-called natural science studies all things, and the so-called mental science studies all principles and thoughts. The universe and all its contents can be analyzed to the simplest form, with idealism and materialism. Materialism advocates equality, but there is still struggle. Idealism advocates peace, and only then can there be great unity. Therefore, the Eastern spirit of morality can protect wealth for a long time compared to the various sciences of the West. The drawbacks of Western material civilization emphasize private interests, only knowing how to plunder and compete with each other. As the ancients said, "If the heart is not benevolent, then parents and brothers can become foreign countries; if the heart is benevolent, then all things can be regarded as one body." Everyone seeking private wealth will create thorns on the smooth road, and all kinds of suffering will come together; everyone seeking public wealth will turn swords into ploughshares, and there will be endless happiness. It is especially hoped that the wise authorities will promote the spirit of the ancient sages. The Great Learning says, "If one family is benevolent, the whole country will be benevolent; if one family is yielding, the whole country will be yielding; if one person is greedy for profit, the whole country will be in chaos." Therefore, if everyone is greedy for private wealth, then great chaos will never cease.</p>
<p>Poverty and illness are the most tragic things in the world. We must first seek to make the people of the world not poor and not sick, and then our own wealth can be protected. Moreover, wealth is not a solitary, fixed, and static thing, but a constantly changing and fluid thing that is integrated into society. If the heart is enslaved, then one becomes a slave to wealth. If I can give wealth, then I am the master of wealth. Using social wealth for society is wisdom, and the use of the "Protecting Wealth" method should still be premised on the welfare of the people.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Economic Circles – Commentary – Continued Thorough Investigation of Hoarding <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>According to a statement made to the Central News Agency yesterday by a person in charge of the Ministry of Finance: "...for the unfinished matters of the thorough investigation of financial institutions, if it is found that there are illegal speculation and hoarding, they will still be severely punished, so as to make the hoarders restrain themselves and the prices tend to be stable..." Indeed, this statement of making the hoarders restrain themselves can be said to be firm enough.</p>
<p>Since the government authorities realized that the soaring prices in Shanghai were purely due to speculation and hoarding, they took the action of jointly conducting a thorough investigation. Given the saying "the past can be pursued", whether the results of the past thorough investigation are satisfactory is for public opinion to decide, so I will not go into details. What we are now eagerly awaiting is to see the effectiveness of the continued thorough investigation of hoarding.</p>
<p>The most effective ways to eradicate speculation and hoarding are: (1) crack down on lending, (2) freeze warehouses, (3) thoroughly investigate stores. From the first point of view, since the authorities conducted a thorough investigation of financial institutions, the only somewhat satisfactory result was that various banks and money shops refused to provide speculative loans and simultaneously reduced outstanding debts. As expected, the hoarders were greatly frightened and came out of their lairs one after another, and market prices gradually declined. From the second point of view, now that the authorities are investigating the situation of stockpiles in various warehouses, all goods in any warehouse should be prohibited from moving, and the owners of the goods and their past movements should be strictly investigated. If there is suspicion of hoarding, the owners should be brought to justice and the goods should be confiscated. From the third point of view, the recent refusal of stores to sell goods is indeed a proof of deliberate hoarding, and many retail hoarders also use stores as their outlet. It is said that the establishment of many new stores is not for retail sales, but for storing hoarded goods, because storing goods in a store does not seem to be illegal on the surface! However, the establishment of such stores is precisely a smokescreen for hoarding, and a thorough investigation should be carried out at the same time, and the public should be encouraged to report such activities.</p>
<p>During the period of continuing strict investigation of hoarding, we would like to specially raise these points, in the hope that the thorough investigation of hoarding must be thorough, and the most important thing is to prevent the possibility of "spring breeze blowing again".</p>

Mr. Fu also serves as the preparatory director for the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association Federation, and preparations have begun. The preparatory office is located at Room 615, Pudong Building. All regional miscellaneous grains trade associations in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai must participate uniformly in accordance with the regulations to complete and unify the structure.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Banks and Financial Firms to Convene Internal Market Meeting Near End of April; Temporarily Suspend Credit Lending <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>For credit lending businesses, banks and financial firms in the city set the end of April and the end of October as comparison periods each year. Companies and firms in all industries and businesses that borrow credit from banks and financial firms must settle their accounts on the day of the comparison period. For credit users who are indeed using the funds for normal business operations, the banks and financial firms will renew the loans within the possible scope, but interest must be settled in full. It is learned that the comparison period at the end of April of this year is approaching, and banks and financial firms have long been preparing for dealings with various companies and businesses. The Money Trade Association has also scheduled an "internal market" meeting on the 25th of this month to determine deposit and loan interest rates. It is heard that during this period for handling the comparison period at the end of April, banks and financial firms will temporarily suspend credit lending, so the financial situation in the city has tightened recently.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Deposit Reserve Funds for Banks and Financial Firms Limited to Be Paid Up by End of Month <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Last year, according to the provisions of the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions" announced by the Ministry of Finance, the Central Reserve Bank instructed all banks and financial firms in the city to deposit reserve funds for term and demand deposits into the bank in accordance with the percentages stipulated by law (5% for term deposits and 10% for demand deposits). By the end of last year, the banks and financial firms had deposited the reserve funds for term deposits in full. However, due to various reasons, the banks and financial firms have not yet fully deposited the reserve funds for demand deposits. It is learned that after the Central Reserve Bank urged the payment of the outstanding reserve funds, they will be fully paid up by the end of this month (April), and it is also heard that when the banks and financial firms pay up the reserve funds, they will all pay in full in cash.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Trade Associations for Ten Industries Limited to Be Established Within Month <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>In order to comply with the requirements of the wartime economic policy program and the various clauses of the Provisional Regulations on Trade Associations of Industry and Commerce, the Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau will adjust and reorganize all old economic organizations that are not suitable for the wartime economic system. It first designated the initiators and conveners of trade associations for ten industries, including the cotton industry, and instructed them to prepare for organization and establishment within a limited time, and report to the authorities for approval. Except for the trade associations of the nine industries of cotton, yarn shops, cloth, coal shops, coal ball, firewood and medicine, industry, oils and fats, cigarettes, matches, soap and candles, and tobacco leaf sales, which have successively held initiator meetings, passed association charters, and scheduled to hold inaugural meetings before the end of this month, the trade association of knitted goods industry has now been ordered to be canceled, the organization has stopped, and the initiators have been redesignated to organize the cotton weaving factory industry trade association within a limited time.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Translated Commentary: The Problem of Hoarding and the Responsibility of the National Government <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The only way to eliminate the ills of hoarding and profiteering is to promote Shanghai's production activities and smooth the purchase and distribution of materials. In short, to seek to improve Shanghai's economic activities and make them transparent, the remedy is to investigate and deal with speculators who hoard and disrupt the economy. We hope that the lower-level institutions of the Commerce and Trade Commission will be deployed in an orderly manner and operated smoothly as soon as possible, which is also an effective means of achieving the above objectives. At the same time, regarding the crackdown on hoarding, we believe that the National Government still needs to fully reflect and make the greatest decisive decision before re-launching.</p>
<p>Last time, the National Government issued an order to thoroughly investigate hoarding, and the general public suffering from high prices cheered. The point that should be paid attention to now is to thoroughly eliminate it. Standing on the people's position, we have to make the following two points to the National Government: We hope that the National Government's crackdown on hoarding is not for factional struggles, and should be out of the purest and most selfless motives, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and revive the economy, and to use sufficient courage and meticulous preparation to re-launch to solve this problem. At the same time, regarding the National Government's internal hoarding and profiteering incident that some people have called for, the National Government should take appropriate measures to investigate whether it is true. As everyone said, "One cannot be an official and a businessman, or a businessman and an official." In addition, it is also necessary to announce that the Reserve Bank has not deviated from the scope of legitimate business and lent hoarding funds, so as to dispel public doubts and leave no room for the people to instigate anti-government remarks. This is the political responsibility of the National Government to the people in times of national crisis.</p>

<h3 id="e64">City Appearance <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Yale</p>
<p>Everything visible in a city can be called "city appearance." The quality of city appearance is extremely related to public perception and also affects morality. In this so-called cultural hub of Shanghai, under the public eye, the bizarre city appearance is truly a sight to behold. However, there are situations that hinder public perception and harm morality, which have "been around for a long time." But there is a tendency for people to "become more intense with each passing day," so it is no wonder that the local authorities are now rectifying the city appearance.</p>
<p>The work that the authorities have already started is repairing roads, clearing garbage, and cracking down on obscene advertisements and frivolous notices. The former not only "enhances the appearance," but also makes the roads smooth, making it safe to walk. Clearing garbage can avoid smoky and foul odors. As for the latter, it can not only maintain good morals, preventing citizens from being dazzled by the colorful and inexplicable notices on the walls, or even thinking about things they shouldn't, but also prevent waste of paper, which is a small help to legitimate cultural needs.</p>
<p>There is naturally a lot of work to be done in rectifying the city appearance; if only these two aspects can be done well, good results can be achieved, and at least the city appearance can be renewed. Other things, such as maintaining order on public vehicles and prohibiting spitting, although long noted by the authorities, require the cooperation of citizens to achieve good results. However, the problem of overcrowding on vehicles leading to disorder can also be said to be half due to the lack of transportation. And the continued popularity of spitting can also be said to be half due to the lack of knowledge and public spirit among citizens. The transition from lack to adequacy is a gradual process.</p>
<p>Since the city appearance is everything visible in a city, then the "appearance" of citizens can certainly be part of the city appearance. Therefore, I think that the people seen on the road are either "worried" or " haggard"; few have a "radiant face." This is probably due to a lack of "vitamins," and perhaps other reasons. But this is not the scope of this article.</p>
<p>If the rectification of the city appearance is done well, I think the faces of the citizens will soon be filled with joy.</p>
<h3 id="e65">How to Eat Tofu? <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shuai</p>
<p>"Tofu has the price of meat" is true, but compared to the current price of meat, it is still much cheaper, so I say be content and eat tofu!</p>
<p>Speaking of tofu, it is a truly quintessential Chinese nutritious food. Its invention dates back more than two thousand years, and the inventor is the famous King of Huainan of the Han Dynasty, Liu An. With such a background, tofu is not a lowly thing.</p>
<p>Its raw material is soybeans. After soaking, grinding, filtering, boiling, and adding brine and gypsum, it is ready to solidify. This is really a scientific manufacturing process!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, tofu shop owners don't advertise (there have been soy milk advertisements). They should imitate the current advertising agencies and promote it as much as possible. I am afraid that the value of their promotional text is more vigorous than those who tell the truth to sell fake medicine. From the nutritional value, plant protein is not as good as animal protein, but the nutritional value of tofu may not be weaker than meat. Every 100 cubic centimeters contains 7 to 8.5 cubic centimeters of protein, 1 to 3.5 cubic centimeters of fat, and 1 to 2 cubic centimeters of carbohydrates, and all kinds of vitamins. Because gypsum is added, it has calcium. Children eat more, their teeth and bones can be healthy, and they can develop normally: pregnant women eat more, they can prevent the calcium in their teeth from being absorbed by the fetus to make bones and decay. Patients with rickets and tuberculosis eat more, they can gradually eliminate the symptoms and become normal. There is not much crude fiber, easy to digest, it is most suitable for patients after illness, children, gastrointestinal diseases, and patients after surgery. And there is no dead toxin. It is a non-nucleoprotein, unlike nucleoproteins that can stimulate the kidneys and liver, so people with kidney disease, heart disease, and edema are best to obtain protein from tofu.</p>
<p>The same family of tofu also includes soy milk, dried tofu, tofu skin, fried tofu and stinky tofu, etc., whose functions are roughly the same.</p>
<p>In terms of culinary arts, there are many varieties. To give a few obvious examples, tofu with Shandong green onion is fragrant and can strengthen the lungs. Tofu with yellow croaker is seafood and can be considered meat. It can be used to make hot and sour soup with tomatoes and pickled mustard greens, which is good for appetizing. Like this, you can turn over more, so as to avoid the "disgust" of eating the same dish for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Independent Spirit <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Mengling</p>
<p>Opening the window, a piece of tender green faces the sun, a small bird chases and skims over the crows that are building nests. It is already spring.</p>
<p>But although spring is in full swing, we are not just singing a few songs to welcome spring, and taking a few steps of green, and then think "spring is ours." That is the way of the small bird. We should learn from the crows, to have an "independent spirit, to use our own strength to build our own nests."</p>
<p>That's right, youth is the time in life with the most "vitality" and "vigor." It is when young people often misunderstand that by relying on temporary emotions and doing unintentional things, they can be considered to have "vitality" and vigor.</p>
<p>The most lacking thing for young people in the workplace is the ability to be "automatic." They all raise their heads and put their hands in their sleeves, and everything needs others to do the puppet work. They move only when pulled, and don't move without being pulled, evading responsibility and being perfunctory. They talk about having great ambitions, but great ambitions must start from small things to achieve the goal!</p>
<p>As for the young people in the family? On the one hand, it is due to the doting of the parents, who arrange everything for them, thinking that the children have no automatic ability, and it is better to do it for them than to teach them to do it slowly. But they don't know that this automatic ability will not grow without cultivation. On the other hand, it must also be attributed to their own laziness. They must understand that their parents will not follow them for life and do things for them.</p>
<p>What about the young students? That automatic spirit also seems to have followed the social unrest and corruption, and has declined together. The teacher stands, the students sit, the teacher turns a page of the book, and the student also turns the page. The book is due tomorrow, so we'll talk about it tomorrow. As for cleaning the classroom and tidying up the dormitory, there are school workers, ringing the bell to eat, ringing the bell to sleep, beautifully called "regular life?"... Decades of education have created a standard lazy thing (but there are also diligent ones).</p>
<p>But how can we develop an independent spirit? As long as we can understand the relationship between this independent spirit and the achievement of a lifetime. We must train, starting from small things in daily life, to find things to do, and with things to do, we should have the ability to arrange plans, and we must review them at any time, be responsible, and humbly accept well-intentioned corrections. These points are the most basic independent training for students and professional young people. Otherwise, even if you are determined to be independent, it is useless.</p>
<p>Is spring ours? Dear friends, I will tell you a piece of news, that nest has been built by the crows yesterday with small branches that they have held in their mouths one by one.</p>
<h3 id="e67">"Humor" and "Satire" <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Lin</p>
<p>Humor is an important key to the "art of living." A person with reason and cultivation usually has the skills of humor. If used properly, it can often allow us to obtain satisfactory results when solving various problems in personnel matters.</p>
<p>When humor comes, it is not only the most intelligent moment, but also the most pleasant moment; it is also the most "genuine" moment. Not only will the person who is humorous show naked emotions, but also the person who accepts his humor will immediately show his true feelings. If a few people are sitting there depressed, they especially hope that a humorous person will go to warm up the situation. Humor is also the most effective tool to eliminate tension, small-mindedness, and great anger.</p>
<p>If a person is rich in humorous personality, it can make all the pride, sorrow, and resentment that often bother him not approach, and make himself feel relaxed and comfortable.</p>
<p>Carlton once said, "I often feel that humor is like the oxygen in the air we breathe, it creates and maintains human laughter. It can certainly create other more important things, but laughter comes first."</p>
<p>As for why we want to "laugh," there is no need to explain it. What people need is a happy life. With a happy mind, we can start to create a career.</p>
<p>But although "humor" is good, if it is too sharp, it becomes "satire." If "satire" is used well, on the one hand, it can make yourself win, and on the other hand, it can also make others strive for progress because of your "satire" to avenge this shame. But I think satire is a great enemy of "friendship." It can never increase friendship, which seems to be fundamentally contrary to the original intention of "humor."</p>
<p>Therefore, it is better to turn humor into encouragement and be a true art of living than to turn humor into satire. Use sincere humor to encourage your friends, so that good advice is not unpleasant to the ear. Use open humor to handle things, so that reason can be clear, and when you hit a wall, you can turn out a new path to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>In order to have true humor, satire should be despised.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Upward · Drill <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>Everyone has a strong enterprising spirit and wants to achieve further achievements than now: Originally, people's hopes are endless. Schopenhauer has these few sentences in his essay on the world's troubles: "...Why are people such insatiable animals? Every desire is satisfied, and the seeds of new desires are planted. Therefore, the desires of all individuals are almost endless..."</p>
<p>With these continuously generated hopes, of course, we must work hard to achieve them, so there are two ways to satisfy the enterprising spirit, namely, "upward" and "drill."</p>
<p>The so-called "upward" is a completely relying on one's own strength, hard work, for the sake of lofty ideals, so usually try to cultivate themselves, spur themselves on, and seriously live a meticulous life... Of course, where there is a will, there is a way. One day, they will be appreciated, praised, and respected and get the success they deserve and realize the hope they deserve.</p>
<p>As for "drill", it is completely different. Like a pointed eel, drilling everywhere, as long as there is an opportunity, they will try to be opportunistic, flatter, seek a way out, take advantage of every opportunity, and drill every hole. They will do everything possible to please their superiors, and speak human words to humans and ghost words to ghosts. Once they get ahead, they will swagger around, and as for what colleagues and friends, they have long been thrown out of their minds... This kind of person is too common.</p>
<p>Drilling is ultimately an extremely despicable and shameful behavior. Some people with "popularity" certainly disdain to do it. Of course, true success depends on true knowledge. How can the bright road be compared with drilling!</p>
<h3 id="e69">Reality <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Zongwen</p>
<p>The past is not worth recalling, and the future is not worth predicting. That is to say, reality is immortal, and only the present moment is the most worthy of cherishing. Living for a day means working hard for a day and striving for a day. Only by grasping reality can life have meaning and value.</p>

<h3 id="e71">The General Association for the Relief of Women and Children Carries Out Various Important Works <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jingwan</p>
<p>The General Association for the Relief of Women and Children of China was founded in the third year of Xuantong, specializing in rescuing lost and abducted women and children. It built a shelter near the Jiangwan Railway Station. During the January 28th Incident, the shelter was destroyed, and it moved to Renyi Shanhui at No. 92 Xinqiao Street in the French Concession. According to the report by Mr. Xu Qianlin, Li Sihao, Zhao Jinqing, Qu Ziliang, and other responsible persons, the important works of the Association are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Detection": The Association employs honest and reliable detectives who secretly go to ports and railway stations to rescue abducted women and children.</p>
<p>(2) "Announcement of Foundlings": When abducted women and children and abandoned children are brought to the Association, advertisements are placed to find their families. Their families only need to provide a reliable guarantor to claim them, without any charges.</p>
<p>(3) "Repatriation": For abducted women and children who can provide detailed addresses, the Association will send them back to their hometowns at its own expense, without any charges.</p>
<p>(4) "Custody": Abducted women and children who have no family to claim them or cannot be sent back to their hometowns will be cared for and educated by the Association as if they were their own.</p>
<p>(5) "Vocational Training": When women and children in custody reach a certain age, the Association introduces them to designated factories or businesses for vocational training, so that they can become self-reliant.</p>
<p>(6) "Adoption and Matching": Those who lack heirs or wish to marry can apply to the Association, providing a reliable guarantor and following the adoption and matching regulations carefully.</p>
<p>The Association has been established for more than thirty years, rescuing more than 12,000 women and children. Apart from those who have been successively sent back, claimed, adopted, matched, and trained, there are currently more than 150 people in the three shelters (Children's Shelter, Boys' Shelter, and Girls' Shelter), many of whom are sent by the police stations of the two concessions. Currently, the cost of living is at least 90,000 yuan. In this time of high prices, there is not enough clothing, and not enough food to eat, and they are in extremely difficult circumstances. The Association lacks funds and has no permanent property. The required expenses depend entirely on donations. Now, we appeal on their behalf, earnestly requesting philanthropists from all walks of life to sympathize with the orphans and the poor, for there is no better accumulation of wealth than the accumulation of virtue. Generously donate, and jointly support this good cause, so that these hundreds of helpless women and children can survive. The merit is immeasurable. (General Association: No. 92 Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, Telephone 40955; Girls' Shelter: No. 979 North Chengdu Road; Donation Collection Points: China Bank (Beijing Road), Tongrun Qianzhuang (Tianjin Road), China General Chamber of Commerce Bank (No. 7 Huangpu Bund).</p>
<p>Assisting with the Aftermath of Poor Woman Gao Ruan's Death: Colleagues from the Dehua Bank wrote: "Having read in your newspaper about Gao Ruan's revival and subsequent death, we feel deeply saddened and regret that we could not help sooner, and we feel uneasy. For the sake of the woman's funeral arrangements, we are sending the previously collected sum of 205 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates in advance." Also, dentist Qin Jinkun contributed 200 yuan for the funeral expenses. The above donations, totaling 405 yuan, have been personally delivered by our office to Mr. Gao Weiren, the woman's husband, with our thanks.</p>
<p>(Note) The deceased is gone. Our office will no longer collect donations for Gao Ruan. Those in the city who are happy to do good deeds are requested to donate generously to our poverty relief fund.</p>
<p>Lost and Found (1) A photographic tripod. If the owner can describe the brand, it can be claimed at the basement of the Great New Company. (2) A bunch of keys was found at the tram stop at the intersection of Seymour Road. The owner should contact Lu Jinlin, a senior student at Jueyuan Yuyuan Yuhang Middle School, to claim them. (3) A bicycle license, French 7035, English 12577, was found. The owner should go to Mr. 　at No. 57 Bisun Road, Shanghai Telephone Company, to claim it.</p>
<p>Selling Flowers to Help the Poor: Mr. Kong Zhiqing, a potted plant enthusiast, will hold a bonsai exhibition at No. 165 Haige Road on the 25th of this month, donating one-tenth of the proceeds to this newspaper's small loan fund.</p>
