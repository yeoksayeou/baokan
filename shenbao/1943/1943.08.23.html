<p>社評</p>
<h3>强化中日合作的途徑</h3>
<p>日本大東亞省靑木大臣此次蒞臨我國，考察對華新政策實施後一般情形，及日本在華各機關工作狀况。我們會就國際形勢與中日兩國當前使命，於日前已致歡迎之詞。當此全世界面臨非常之時代，我們站在中國人民立塲，敬再掬誠獻言如下：</p>
<p>中日關係，在最近數十年中，變幻獨多。按諸往史，則以今日的協同作戰，休戚與共的關係最爲密切。可是，從過去十年以至二十年以前的中日關係，演變至今日的同生共存階段，其主要的轉捩關鍵，中日兩國人民均當有正確的認識，尤其是兩國的政治家，更當認識淸楚，從而把握關鍵所在，使中日協力的程度，日進旡疆。古人云：「前事不忘，後事之師」。歷史原是人類創造的，中日關係，在十年二十年以前，既未計擬今日的轉變，但居今日却不能不推想到五年十年以後的趨勢，這在兩國的政治貴任者必須放遠目光，準備未來，遠處着眼，近處入手。對於目前現狀，固然未能認爲件件不滿意；但也不能說件件十分滿意。這裏，盼望兩國當局多多傾聽民間呼聲，以爲調整與改進的根據。此其一。</p>
<p>「行百步者半九十」，這是中國一句勉人奮鬥到底的成語，確是自古政治家實際經騐的結論，往往有一種動機非常良好，內容非常完善，而且在實施上也非常認眞的事，但在執行過程中偶然的疏漏忽略或某種外來的因素，仍不免「爲山九　，功虧一簣」，這是歷史上不乏前例的。目前日本正在推行的對華新政策，其動機的純正與內容的切適現實，固然已便中國人民漸漸瞭解，可是不必諱言的，因爲過去中日關係的痕跡以及目前存在的複雜情形，也許不能收穫預期的成效，但爲了大東亞戰爭之勝利，以及東亞新秩序之建立，絕對不容許有功虧一簣的事態。所以，日本對華新政策，除了已有純正的動機與適切現實的內容以外，還需要處理得當與執行周到兩點。這樣才可使新政策得到具體的實現。此其二。</p>
<p>强化中日台作的中心，在於强化國民政府，這是中日兩國已經認淸的一點。幾年以來，友邦對於這一工作之努力，尤其是靑木大臣對這一點的功績，也是大家已經認淸了。同時，國民政府的强化，也漸爲人民所重視。然而，國民政府强化的因素，是在「得民」，是要使國民政府眞正成爲全國國民一致擁戴的政府。因此，一定要努力堅定國民這種信念。由於這種國民的信念產生擁護國府的支枝力量，那才是國府强化的原動力。至於如何堅定人民擁戴國府的信念，關於這問題，我們會屢次提出，也是今天我們更加强調的，就是先行强化人民力量，人民大衆所共同希望於政府應做者，政府絕對俯順民意去做，換言之，政府所做的，必定是人民要政府做的此其三。</p>
<p>靑木大臣過去曾仟國民政府最高經濟顧問，他的學識經騐是淵博的，對於中國經濟是異常熟悉的，國民政府的領導人物叉是極其熟稔的，而大東亞省爲對華新政策的主幹機構，靑木大臣又是實際負責者，在各個方面推論，靑木大臣是促進中日合作惟一的適當與負責人物，此次蒞華又爲考察新政策實施後一般情况，對於中日合作前途自將發生重大的決定作用。我們更願率直的貢　意見如上，以供靑木大臣）及巾日常局的奇攷。</p>
<h3>在京任務已完畢　靑木大臣昨抵滬　訪陳市長懇談並接見記者團</h3>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電日大東亞省靑木大臣，自十九日來　後，連日在京酬酢紛繁，並與我國政府當局，對協力完遂大東亞戰爭，及日本對華新施策等各項間題，推誠交換意見，結果極爲圓滿。茲以任務完畢，特於今二十二日上午九時，乘機飛滬，即將轉道返國。到機塲歡送者，有褚部長民誼，陳部長君　，梅部長思平，李總監謳一，陳次長之碩，等各部長官，及友邦谷大使，柴山中將。松井總參謀長，寺岡少將，落合少將，等百餘人。靑木大臣及隨員與歡送者一一握手畢。即登機，九時正引擎發動，靑木大臣及各隨員於機中頻頻揮手示別，各歡送人員亦皆脫帽頜首。俄頃機塲升於碧空，盤旋一匝後，即向東飛去。</p>
<p>上海二十二日中央社訊日靑木大東亞相，以在京公務完畢，乃偕同竹內總務局晨以下隨員，於二十二日上午十時，自南京飛滬，下榻於百老匯飯店。</p>
<p>靑木大臣，陳市長懇談　靑木大臣會見各記者情形</p>
<p>上海二十二日中央社訊日靑木大東亞相，已於二十二日上午十時，由南京抵滬。即於上午十一時三十分，於上海日本大使館事務所，與田尻公使及各部長，矢野總領事，岡崎波兩參事官等，舉行懇談。並在大使館食議室，對大使館之高級官員，有所訓示。下午二時五十分，訪陳上海市長，對收囘租界後之上海建　方策，作種種懇談。更於下千四時起，在百老匯飯店會見記者團，發表談話。五時起在旅邸與日軍方面代表怨談。六時五十分，偕同隨員赴吉田中國方面艦隊司令官官邸訪問。晚間並出席司令長官之晚餐會。</p>
<p>（又訊）日靑木大東亞相等，已於二十二日上午，由兩京飛抵上海。靑木氏此行，目睹日對華新政策實施後之中國實况，而對新政策之推進，愈堅强其自信，對今後中日協力之具體方策與途徑，亦有明確之認識。靑木氏兩氏晋謁汪主席懇談後，復與周財政部長，褚外交部長，陳建設部長，梅實業部長等國府各長官，一一談，開誠交換意見，及力使兩國緊密之協力，對遂行大東亞戰爭上，得益頗多。且確信中國當前之物價問題，及物資交流之不同滑等，均可由中日之協力而解決之。故靑木氏歸國後，日對華新政策將有更新之進展。又靑木氏對日駐華各機關之再調整，及對中國經濟上之協力，亦曾加以特別考慮，殊堪注目。</p>
<p>與日記者談話</p>
<p>中央社滬訊日靑木大東亞大臣，二十二日由京飛抵上海，先後與陳市長及日軍當局，大使館事務所首腦部等，舉行懇談後。於下午四時三十分，在百老匯大廈接見日本記者團，曾就當前各問題，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>此次爲視察實施日本對華新政策後之中國悄形，並與國民政府當局，及常地日軍，暨大東亞省駐外機關要員，舉行懇談起見，特來訪問離別已歷十閱月之中國。在南京已完了預定日程，於本日來滬，已與軍當局及陳市長等，舉行懇談。前在南京時，亦已與汪主席暨各部長，充分交換意見，結果均能深切理解日本之新方針，與日本協力，共同完　大東亞戰爭之決意，日益鞏固，衷心極感興奮。中日兩國軍官民，對中日提携，及日本對華新政策等之意義，日益認識淸楚，但爲使兩國國民間之最末端亦均能了解，則須兩國更加緊之努力。</p>
<p>收回租界意義重大</p>
<p>收囘上海租界是中國歷史上的大事從中日關係上而觀察。亦　　時代的重大事體。對於此點，至界之結果，從政治上看上海，可肅淸過去以英美為中心之國際色彩，脫出英美之支配，可受中國政治力之使潤，成爲一新都市，此爲根本的意義。又從經濟上而觀，過去上海成爲英美侵略東亞之據點，常地經濟界人成長在自由主義的空氣中，絲毫未曾受過國家統制之訓練。此輩經濟界人由於租界之消滅，已認識上海負有發展中國經濟　點之新使命，必須將其自衣賴外國貿易的都市，更生爲發展國內工業這基礎的都市。因之無論在政治上，經濟上，均以收囘租界為界爲轉捩點上海，改向新方向前進，故應超越一切利害觀念，以上海爲中國經濟基地之信念，一致步伐，勇往直前，對於上海之發展、中國是其責任者，而日本是其協力者，余切望兩者密切提携，早日完成建設新上海，爲建設大東亞中日提携最　緊要，所期望於上海之發展，亦極重大。又對於國民政府實施收買沙布，已承國民政府各要人作詳細說明，但該問　從中國之物價物資政策而觀，實爲非常英　斷之指罷。日方對此亦表示充分協力，希望該施策之實施，能得安善而無遺憾云。</p>
<h3>基斯加日軍　担負新任務　美加軍登陸一無所獲</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電日大本營於二十二日十二時發表：守備基斯加島之日陸海軍部隊，已於七月下句於未受敵方絲亳妨害前，將整個兵力徹囘，現巳祖任某新任務。（按基斯加（Kiskali）在阿留申羣島之四端）</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十二日中央社電據奎貝克電，美總統羅斯福及加拿大首相金格於二卞一日發表共同聲明，其大意謂：美軍及加軍有力部隊已於八月十五日在艦艇護衛下，朱遭遇何等抵抗，在阿留申羣島中之基斯加島登陸，登陸後並未發見日軍一兵一卒，日軍必已利用濃霧，早已徹離該島。至於最近美國並未發表曾轟炸或用艦艇砲火轟擊該島之事，乃爲確保反軸心軍登陸之安全也。</p>
<h3>爭奪卡科夫要塞　兩軍大戰方酣　德增援作有力反攻</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十二日中央社電卡科夫市東北村落中蘇軍突擊隊，與德軍守備隊仍不分晝夜續作慘烈戰鬥，德軍利用所有房屋及一切掩護物，死守該地，强力阻止蘇軍之前進。蘇軍司令部爲對卡科夫展開大迂迥戰，已移動其重點於該市西北及西南方之重要鐵路，爭奪戰自二十日以來，糾結大兵於卡斜夫西北一百三十公里之雷北金及卡市西北一百公里之阿夫薩爾加地方，在三十公里狹隘之戰綫上，兩軍機甲部隊展開富有彈力性之大機動戰。德軍鑒於卡科夫波爾太烘戰綫之電要性，已陸續增援有力之預備隊，開始猛烈反攻。他方卡科夫西南方之蘇軍，亦於遮斷卡科夫至聶伯貝特羅斯克之錢道後，更圖一鼓攻入波爾太伐，據莫斯科電，傳蘇軍先鋒部隊到達波羅太伐州邊境，然尙未證實。又南部戰綫，蘇軍呼應伊齋姆區之攻勢，亦於二十一日在伏羅希洛夫格勒開始大規模攻勢，目下正在　戰中。</p>
<h3>襲漢渝機　被擊落四架</h3>
<p>漢口十九日中央社電日海軍機於二十一日邀擊來襲漢口地區之駐渝美空軍時，曾擊落敵統一式重蟲炸機三架。此外據調杏所得，又查明日軍地上部隊亦在武昌擊落敵卡斯基PA型機一架，敵機共損失四架。</p>
<h3>日文壇鉅子　島崎藤村逝世</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電日本文壇巨子島崎藤村氏，於二十二日下午令時三十分突患腦充血症逝世。享年七十二歲。按該氏於日本文壇被尊爲”體詩之父，昭和十一年民國二十五年曾代表日本前往阿根廷出席萬國文會，遺　　村詩集，破戒新生，黎明之前。</p>
<h3>蘇駐美大使　李維諾夫免職　遺缺由格洛米柯繼任</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十二日中央社電莫斯科無綫電本日播稱：李維諾夫已被免去駐美大使之職，遺缺已委格洛米柯　任。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十二日中央社電蘇聯之更迭駐美大便，美政府首腦方面似感極大恐惶，　蘇聯前既召回駐英大使邁斯基，此次又調回親英美派之巨頭李攏諾夫，認蘇聯此舉爲變更對英美政策之先聲，但有一部份人士以李維諾夫與邁斯基，同被任爲蘇外務人民委員會次長之事實而仍持樂觀，惟當此奎貝克會談正在進行，而蘇聯對第二戰綫問題表明不滿之時，蘇政府此種措置，或亦爲對英美之無言抗議，故其歸趨仍堪注目。</p>
<h3>大東亞决戰的眞相（一）</h3>
<p>— 栗原大佐</p>
<p>勝敗決於一瞬　為生產補充一致奮起</p>
<p>太平洋戰局固爲敵人美軍自南北兩方挑戰，到現在已進至重要階段的時候，日本大本營海軍報道部課長栗原悅藏大佐於十四日下午在茨城縣內原訓練所，以「大束亞戰爭和海軍爲題，作下面的講演，闡述大東亞戰爭的意義，所羅門決戰的特性，和對於現在戰局國民應抱的覺悟。現已到了一億國民全體　起的時候加强這個論調，把很大的感動給與」土的戰士」，同時要求他們更要激動而奮起。</p>
<p>序言</p>
<p>今天本人對着皇國農村終鍊道塲的本訓練所的「土的戰士」各位，很簡單的　現在戰局的實况吿訴各位。並把自己關於在這皇國自古以來從未有過的難局，後方農村負担使命如何的重大，發揮皇國傳統的農村精神和農民魂乃爲決勝這戰爭的所不能缺少的要件等等意見，逐一貢獻給各位。</p>
<p>就最近世界戰局考察一下，便可以如道，東戰棧的德蘇戰爭的狀態間從北非洲的英美軍的登　戰轉變到西四里的攻防戰，又盟邦義大利的政變，英美對德本土空　的强化，凡此沒有一件不是象徵着歐洲戰局的再大性的，又在太平洋戰局方面，去年八月七日左右，敵人美國先對瓜達爾加那爾島，又對北方阿留巾　烏的阿　島，以及大島島等加以最初的反攻以來，所羅門　島。新幾內亞方而的戰局一天比一天緊張起來，特別在本年二月皇軍從瓜達爾加那爾島轉進後，敵人美國照例依靠他的强大的物的戰力，動員他所有的飛機，艦船，以及其新式科學兵器作反攻他戰。可是歐洲方面敵人反攻和緬印國境，阿留申方面，或中國大陸方面敵人反攻，都有互相密接的關聯。從開戰初期慘收後　起來的英美所　劃的反攻作戰是如何有計劃的以及敵人的戰意是如何旺盛的，都可以很顯明的推想而知。上述的戰况實在是「食與被食」和「生與死」的血戰死鬥的連續，從這點看來，可以知道這次的戰爭並不是普通世人所想像的那麼容易的。</p>
<p>大東亞戰</p>
<p>爭的意義</p>
<p>原來火東亞戰爭是美國向日本挑起的戰爭，這事實已在宣戰大詔中很顯明的昭示過了。敵人美國以他的「經濟的武器」向我國挑戰乃是這次大戰勃發的直接起因，美國不把本國剩餘的鐵屑，工作機械，石油賣給日木，想用這種方法制日本經濟的死命，日本得不到這種重要物資就只好束手待斃，是很顯而易見的。美　如把本國多餘的物資用平和的通商賣給日本，他可以得到利益，並不虧本，但是美國不這樣做，反而故意的實行禁止這種物資對日　出，更進一步採取資金凍結的暴舉，事實上已到了經濟絕交的地步，英美所以要這樣做，完全起因於敵人英美貪而無　的世界制覇的野心，這次火東亞戰爭無疑的完全由於敵人英美　　的挑戰而發生的，所以大東亞戰爭，於敵人美國是「奢侈的戰爭」，反之，對於我國就是無可如何的「賭生死存亡的戰爭』。</p>
<p>原來美國所最恃的是甚經濟力和生產力，以上次珍珠灣慘敗爲轉　，傾國家總力而增强其軍需之生產力，以及整備強化國內戰時體制。對於以經濟力和生產力作最大武器的敵人，我國須以經濟力和經濟力而對付之。我們固然在此次戰事發動以前，已經有了這種覺悟，各種準備已經齊全，不過戰事長期化、消耗又很大，所以一面戰爭一面生產，一面生產一面戰爭，已成最要之　。（靈譯自八月十六日西部　日新聞）</p>

<h3>戶口米兩個月缺數　補足並無困難　糧部指撥數額足够支配</h3>
<p>大通社云：米糧聯營社，昨日透露消息，爲運輸機構靈活起見，殊有調整必要，現正向大康運輸公司接洽代運。據大通社記者探悉：上港一八兩區人口，約計爲二百十三萬餘，故每日每期以需米二升計，總計需米四萬包，每月三期，共需米十二萬包，連同舊市區，如能按月由糧部指撥食米十五萬包，即足供應。惟聯管社對七月糧部指撥食米十五萬包，尙未全數運滬，而八月份轉瞬過去，部部指撥食米十五萬包，尙未動運，故深足引起市民之焦慮。惟若能將七月份缺數，及八月份指撥之米，趕速運滬，則補足缺數，並無困難。至第四十四期戶口米，己定明日截止，第四十五期戶口米配給數量及日期，一區米粉採備科，正待米糧聯營社之供應確數後，即行公布。</p>

<h3>棉布計口配給　近期可實現　確實辦法仍未透露</h3>
<p>據泰晤士報記者向可靠之消息靈通方面探悉，對於紗布之計口配給事宜，當局現已予以注意，本　內即可望計口配給之計劃閉始實現，同時未行登記之紗布存貨，則已准予在十五天期限內補行登記，至於每一上海居民每次究可獲得多少量之紗在配給，則尙不如悉，惟據可凱估計，每年每人消費額約爲十碼，但據有關方面猜測，計口授給紗布計劃之實行，每人每年領購數額必不止十碼，而其價格亦必較目前爲低。</p>
<p>紗布統稅將予變更</p>
<p>此次當局實施收買棉紗布後，因棉紗布統稅之徵收方式係採取從價稅，爲適應情勢起見。故此後對於棉紗布徵收方法，亦將隨棉紗布價格之下跌而將予以變動。</p>

<h3>Ways to Strengthen Sino-Japanese Cooperation</h3>
<p>The recent visit of Minister Aoki of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry to our country, to investigate the general situation after the implementation of the new China policy and the work status of various Japanese agencies in China, and our discussions on the international situation and the current missions of China and Japan, to which we have already extended our welcome, all occurred during this time when the whole world is facing an extraordinary era. Standing from the perspective of the Chinese people, we respectfully offer the following sincere words again:</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese relations have undergone many changes in recent decades. Looking back on history, the current relationship of joint combat and shared destiny is the closest. However, the key turning point in the evolution of Sino-Japanese relations from the past ten to twenty years to the current stage of coexistence, should be correctly understood by the people of both China and Japan, especially by the politicians of both countries, who should clearly understand and grasp the key to enhance the degree of Sino-Japanese cooperation without limit. As the ancients said, "Do not forget the past, it can be a guide for the future." History is created by mankind. Sino-Japanese relations, in the past ten or twenty years, did not anticipate today's changes, but today we cannot but think about the trends of the next five or ten years. Those responsible for politics in both countries must have a long-term vision, prepare for the future, look far ahead, and start with the near. Regarding the current situation, we cannot say that everything is unsatisfactory, but we cannot say that everything is perfect either. Here, we hope that the authorities of both countries will listen more to the voices of the people as a basis for adjustment and improvement. This is the first point.</p>
<p>"He who walks a hundred steps is only halfway there at ninety," this is a Chinese idiom to encourage people to persevere to the end. It is indeed the conclusion of practical experience of politicians since ancient times. There are often things with very good motives, very perfect content, and very serious implementation, but accidental omissions or negligence in the implementation process, or some external factors, still inevitably lead to "building a mountain only to fail near completion," this is not without precedent in history. The new China policy currently being promoted by Japan, the purity of its motives and the suitability of its content to reality, has indeed gradually been understood by the Chinese people, but it is undeniable that, due to the traces of past Sino-Japanese relations and the complex situation that exists at present, it may not achieve the expected results. However, for the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the establishment of a new order in East Asia, a situation of failing near completion is absolutely not allowed. Therefore, in addition to having pure motives and appropriately realistic content, the new Japan's China policy also needs proper handling and thorough implementation. Only in this way can the new policy be concretely realized. This is the second point.</p>
<p>The core of strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation lies in strengthening the National Government. This is a point that both China and Japan have already recognized. For several years, the efforts of friendly nations in this work, especially the contributions of Minister Aoki in this regard, have also been recognized by everyone. At the same time, the strengthening of the National Government has gradually been valued by the people. However, the factors for strengthening the National Government lie in "winning the people's hearts," to make the National Government truly a government unanimously supported by the people of the whole country. Therefore, we must strive to strengthen this belief of the people. Because this belief of the people generates a supporting force for the National Government, that is the driving force for the strengthening of the National Government. As for how to strengthen the people's belief in supporting the National Government, we have repeatedly raised this issue, and it is also what we emphasize even more today, that is, to first strengthen the people's strength. What the people commonly hope the government should do, the government must absolutely follow the will of the people to do it. In other words, what the government does must be what the people want the government to do. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Minister Aoki once served as the Chief Economic Advisor to the National Government in the past. His knowledge and experience are profound, he is extremely familiar with the Chinese economy, and he is extremely familiar with the leading figures of the National Government. The Greater East Asia Ministry is the main agency for the new China policy, and Minister Aoki is the person actually in charge. Reasoning from all aspects, Minister Aoki is the only appropriate and responsible person to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation. This visit to China is also to investigate the general situation after the implementation of the new policy, and will inevitably have a significant decisive effect on the future of Sino-Japanese cooperation. We are even more willing to offer our frank opinions as above for the consideration of Minister Aoki and the Japanese authorities.</p>
<h3>Completed Task in Nanjing. Minister Aoki Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday. Cordial Talks with Mayor Chen and Meeting with Journalist Group</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. Minister Aoki of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, since arriving here on the 19th, has been busy with banquets in Nanjing for several consecutive days, and has sincerely exchanged opinions with our government authorities on various issues such as cooperating to complete the Greater East Asia War and Japan's new China policy, resulting in a very satisfactory outcome. Now that the task is completed, he took a flight to Shanghai at 9:00 AM this morning, the 22nd, and will soon transfer back to his country. Those who came to the airport to see him off included Minister Chu Minyi, Minister Chen Junpu, Minister Mei Siping, Chief Supervisor Li Ouyi, Deputy Minister Chen Zhishuo, and other ministers and officials, as well as Ambassador Tani of the friendly nation, Lieutenant General Shibayama, Chief of Staff Matsui, Major General Teraoka, Major General Ochia, and more than a hundred others. Minister Aoki and his entourage shook hands with the well-wishers one by one. He then boarded the plane, and at 9:00 AM sharp, the engine started. Minister Aoki and his entourage frequently waved goodbye in the plane, and all the well-wishers also took off their hats and nodded in response. After circling once in the blue sky, the plane flew east.</p>
<p>Shanghai, 22nd, Central News Agency News. Minister Aoki of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, having completed his official duties in Nanjing, accompanied by Director-General Takeuchi and other entourage members, flew from Nanjing to Shanghai at 10:00 AM on the 22nd and stayed at the Broadway Mansions.</p>
<p>Minister Aoki, Cordial Talks with Mayor Chen. Minister Aoki's Meeting with Journalists.</p>
<p>Shanghai, 22nd, Central News Agency News. Minister Aoki of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 22nd. At 11:30 AM, he held cordial talks with Minister Tajiri and various ministers of the Japanese Embassy Office in Shanghai, Consul General Yano, and Councilors Okazaki and Nami, etc. He also gave instructions to senior officials of the embassy in the embassy's dining room. At 2:50 PM, he visited Mayor Chen of Shanghai and had various cordial talks on the construction policies of Shanghai after the recovery of the concessions. Furthermore, starting from 4:00 PM, he met with a journalist group at the Broadway Mansions and delivered a speech. Starting at 5:00 PM, he held confidential talks with representatives of the Japanese military at the residence. At 6:50 PM, he and his entourage visited the residence of Commander Yoshida of the Japanese China Area Fleet. In the evening, he also attended the commander-in-chief's dinner party.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) Minister Aoki of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, etc., flew to Shanghai from Nanjing this morning. Through this trip, Mr. Aoki witnessed the actual situation in China after the implementation of Japan's new China policy, and became more confident in promoting the new policy, and also has a clear understanding of the specific strategies and ways of future Sino-Japanese cooperation. After Mr. Aoki and his entourage paid their respects to Chairman Wang and had cordial talks, they also spoke with Finance Minister Zhou, Foreign Minister Chu, Construction Minister Chen, and Industry Minister Mei, and other heads of the National Government, and sincerely exchanged opinions, and made great efforts to make close cooperation between the two countries, which benefited greatly in carrying out the Greater East Asia War. It is also believed that the current price problem in China and the unequal smoothness of material exchanges can be resolved through Sino-Japanese cooperation. Therefore, after Mr. Aoki returns to his country, Japan's new China policy will have newer progress. In addition, Mr. Aoki also gave special consideration to the readjustment of various Japanese agencies stationed in China and economic cooperation with China, which is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Talks with Japanese Journalists</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai. Minister Aoki of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry flew to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 22nd. After holding cordial talks with Mayor Chen and the heads of the embassy office and the Japanese military authorities, he met with a group of Japanese journalists at the Broadway Building at 4:30 PM and gave a speech on current issues as follows:</p>
<p>This visit is to inspect the situation in China after the implementation of Japan's new China policy, and to hold cordial talks with the authorities of the National Government, the local Japanese military, and key members of the Greater East Asia Ministry's overseas agencies. I am visiting China, which I have been away from for more than ten months. The scheduled itinerary in Nanjing has been completed, and I came to Shanghai today, and have had cordial talks with the military authorities and Mayor Chen, etc. Earlier in Nanjing, I also fully exchanged opinions with Chairman Wang and various ministers, and as a result, they were able to deeply understand Japan's new policy, and their determination to cooperate with Japan to jointly complete the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more consolidated, which I feel extremely excited about. The military and civilians of China and Japan are increasingly aware of the significance of Sino-Japanese cooperation and Japan's new China policy, but in order to make even the most basic of the two countries' citizens understand, the two countries must make even closer efforts.</p>
<p>The Recovery of the Concessions is of Great Significance</p>
<p>The recovery of the Shanghai concessions is a major event in Chinese history. From the perspective of Sino-Japanese relations, it is also a major event of the times. Regarding this point, the result of the recovery of the concessions is that, from a political point of view, Shanghai can eliminate the international color that was centered on Britain and the United States in the past, get rid of the control of Britain and the United States, and become a new city that can be influenced by China's political power, which is the fundamental significance. From an economic point of view, Shanghai used to be a base for British and American aggression in East Asia, and local economic people grew up in an atmosphere of liberalism and have never been trained in national control. These economic people have realized that Shanghai has a new mission to develop the Chinese economy due to the elimination of the concessions, and it must transform from a city that relies on foreign trade to a city that develops domestic industry. Therefore, whether in politics or economics, the recovery of the concessions is a turning point for Shanghai to move forward in a new direction. Therefore, we should transcend all considerations of interests and move forward with the belief that Shanghai is a base for the Chinese economy. China is responsible for the development of Shanghai, and Japan is its cooperator. I sincerely hope that the two will cooperate closely and complete the construction of a new Shanghai as soon as possible, which is the most important thing for Sino-Japanese cooperation in the construction of Greater East Asia. The development expected of Shanghai is also extremely significant. In addition, regarding the National Government's implementation of the purchase of burlap, I have received detailed explanations from various important people of the National Government, but this issue is indeed a very accurate judgment from the perspective of China's price and material policy. The Japanese side has also expressed full cooperation in this regard, and hopes that the implementation of this policy can be safe, sound and without regrets.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army on Kiska Island Undertakes a New Task. American and Canadian Troops Landed with Nothing to Gain</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 12:00 on the 22nd: The Japanese army and naval forces guarding Kiska Island completely withdrew their entire forces in the lower ten days of July before being hindered by the enemy in the slightest, and have now taken on a certain new task. (Note: Kiska is at the end of the Aleutian Islands).</p>
<p>Argentina, Jingcheng, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. According to a report from Quebec, US President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King jointly issued a statement on the 21st, the gist of which is: US and Canadian forces landed on Kiska Island in the Aleutian Islands on August 15 under the protection of warships without encountering any resistance. After landing, no Japanese soldiers were found. The Japanese army must have taken advantage of the dense fog to withdraw from the island long ago. As for the recent failure of the United States to announce that it had bombed or bombarded the island with naval gun fire, it was to ensure the safety of the landing of the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<h3>The Battle for the Fortress of Kharkov. Both Armies are Engaged in Fierce Fighting. Germany Sent Reinforcements to Launch a Powerful Counterattack</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. Soviet assault teams in villages northeast of the city of Kharkov and German garrison troops continue to engage in fierce battles day and night. German troops are using all houses and all shelters to defend the area and strongly prevent the Soviet troops from advancing. The Soviet Command, in order to launch a large encirclement of Kharkov, has moved its focus to the important railways northwest and southwest of the city. Since the 20th, the battle has involved large numbers of troops in the areas of Lebedin, 130 kilometers northwest of Kharkov, and Afsarga, 100 kilometers northwest of the city. On a narrow battle line of 30 kilometers, the armored forces of the two armies launched a great mobile war with flexibility. In view of the importance of the Kharkov-Poltava front line, the German army has successively reinforced powerful reserve forces and began a fierce counterattack. On the other hand, the Soviet troops southwest of Kharkov, in response to the offensive in the Izium area, also launched a large-scale offensive in Voroshilovgrad on the 21st, and are currently in fierce fighting. According to a Moscow dispatch, it is reported that the vanguard of the Soviet troops has reached the border of the Poltava Oblast, but this has not been confirmed. In addition, on the southern front, the Soviet troops, echoing the offensive in the Izium area, also launched a large-scale offensive in Voroshilovgrad on the 21st and are currently in fierce fighting.</p>
<h3>Four Raiding Planes Shot Down Over Wuhan and Chongqing</h3>
<p>Hankou, 19th, Central News Agency Telegraph. When Japanese naval aircraft intercepted US Air Force planes raiding the Hankou area on the 21st, they shot down three enemy unified heavy bombers. In addition, according to the results of the investigation, it was also found that Japanese ground forces shot down an enemy Curtiss P-40 fighter plane in Wuchang, for a total loss of four enemy aircraft.</p>
<h3>A Giant of Japanese Literature, Toson Shimazaki Passes Away</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. The giant of Japanese literature, Toson Shimazaki, suddenly died of cerebral congestion at 0:30 PM on the 22nd. He was 72 years old. By this report, he was revered in Japanese literary circles as the "Father of Lyric Poetry." In 1936, he represented Japan at the International PEN Congress in Argentina. His works include "Toson Poetry Collection," "The Broken Commandment," "The New Life," and "Before Dawn."</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, Dismissed. The Vacancy is Succeeded by Gromyko</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. Moscow Radio broadcast today that Litvinov has been dismissed from his position as Ambassador to the United States, and the vacancy has been filled by Gromyko.</p>
<p>Argentina, Jingcheng, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegraph. The US government seems to be extremely alarmed by the Soviet Union's change of ambassador to the United States. Since the Soviet Union previously recalled its ambassador to Britain, Maisky, this time it has also recalled Litvinov, a giant of the pro-British and American faction, believing that this move by the Soviet Union is a prelude to changing its policy toward Britain and the United States. However, some people remain optimistic because Litvinov and Maisky have both been appointed as Deputy People's Commissars of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. However, at a time when the Quebec Conference is underway and the Soviet Union has expressed dissatisfaction with the second front issue, this measure by the Soviet government may also be a silent protest against Britain and the United States, so its outcome is still noteworthy.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Great East Asia Decisive Battle (1)</h3>
<p>— Colonel Kurihara</p>
<p>Victory or Defeat Determined in an Instant, Strive Together for Production and Replenishment</p>
<p>At a time when the Pacific War situation is firmly established by the enemy's US forces challenging from the north and south, and now has reached an important stage, Colonel Etsuzo Kurihara, Chief of the Naval Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, gave the following speech at the Urahara Training Center in Ibaraki Prefecture on the afternoon of the 14th, entitled "The Great East Asia War and the Navy," elaborating on the significance of the Greater East Asia War, the characteristics of the Solomon decisive battle, and the awareness that the people should have of the current war situation. Now is the time for the entire 100 million people to rise up and strengthen this argument, giving great emotion to "earthy warriors" and at the same time asking them to be even more excited and rise up.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Today, I would like to simply tell you, the "earthy warriors" of this training center, facing the Imperial Country's rural finishing dojo, about the real situation of the current war situation. And I would like to contribute my opinions one by one regarding how heavy the mission of the rural rear is in this unprecedented difficult situation of the Imperial Country, and how the rural spirit and farmer soul of the Imperial Country's tradition are indispensable elements for winning this war.</p>
<p>If we examine the recent world war situation, we can see that the state of the German-Soviet war on the eastern front has changed from the landing battle of the British and American forces in North Africa to the battle of offense and defense in Sicily, and the coup in allied Italy, and the strengthening of British and American air raids on the German mainland, all of which are symbolic of the great nature of the European war situation. On the Pacific war front, since the enemy United States launched its first counteroffensive on Guadalcanal Island and the islands of Attu and Kiska in the northern Aleutian Islands around August 7 last year, the war situation in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea has become more tense day by day. Especially after the Imperial Army transferred from Guadalcanal Island in February of this year, the enemy United States routinely relied on its powerful material warfare capabilities, mobilizing all its aircraft, ships, and new scientific weapons to counterattack. However, the enemy's counteroffensives on the European side, on the border of Burma and India, in the Aleutian Islands, or on the Chinese mainland, are all closely related to each other. It can be clearly inferred how planned the counteroffensive operations of the British and Americans, who have recovered from the disastrous defeats at the beginning of the war, are, and how vigorous the enemy's war intentions are. The above-mentioned war situation is really a continuous blood battle and death struggle of "eat and be eaten" and "live and die." From this point of view, we can know that this war is not as easy as the average person imagines.</p>
<p>The Great East Asia</p>
<p>War's Significance</p>
<p>Originally, the Great East Asia War was a war provoked by the United States against Japan, which has been clearly shown in the declaration of war. The enemy United States challenged our country with its "economic weapons," which was the direct cause of the outbreak of this great war. It was obvious that the United States would not sell its surplus scrap iron, machine tools, and oil to Japan, wanting to use this method to control Japan's economic life. If Japan could not obtain these important materials, it would have to sit and wait for death. If the United States sold its surplus materials to Japan through peaceful trade, it could benefit and would not lose money, but the United States did not do so. Instead, it deliberately prohibited the export of these materials to Japan and further took the outrageous measure of freezing funds. In fact, it had reached the point of economic severance. The reason why Britain and the United States did this was entirely due to the enemy's British and American insatiable ambition to dominate the world. There is no doubt that the Great East Asia War was entirely due to the challenge of the enemy's Britain and America. Therefore, the Great East Asia War is a "luxury war" for the enemy United States. On the contrary, for our country, it is an unavoidable "war of life and death."</p>
<p>Originally, what the United States relied on most was its economic strength and production capacity. Taking the disastrous defeat at Pearl Harbor as a turning point, it poured the total strength of the country into increasing its military production capacity and strengthening its domestic wartime system. To deal with the enemy, who takes economic strength and production capacity as its greatest weapon, our country must deal with it with economic strength and economic strength. We certainly had this awareness before the outbreak of this war, and all kinds of preparations have been completed, but the war has been prolonged and the consumption is very high, so it has become the most important thing to produce while fighting and fight while producing.

<h3>Rice Shortage for Two Months. Supplementing the Shortage is Not Difficult. The Grain Department Allocates Enough Quantity</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency said: The Rice and Grain Joint Cooperative revealed yesterday that it is necessary to adjust the transportation organization in order to make it more flexible. It is currently in contact with Datong Transportation Company to transport on its behalf. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the population of the first and eighth districts of Shanghai is estimated to be more than 2.13 million, so calculating at two liters of rice per person per day, a total of 40,000 bags of rice are needed. Three periods per month require a total of 120,000 bags of rice. Together with the old city area, if the Grain Department can allocate 150,000 bags of rice per month, it will be sufficient to supply. However, the Joint Management Cooperative has not yet transported all of the 150,000 bags of rice allocated by the Grain Department in July to Shanghai, and August has passed in an instant, and the 150,000 bags of rice allocated by the Department have not yet been transported, which is causing great anxiety among the citizens. However, if the shortage in July and the rice allocated in August can be transported to Shanghai quickly, it will not be difficult to make up for the shortage. As for the 44th period of household rice, it is scheduled to end tomorrow. The Rice Flour Preparation Section of the first district is awaiting the confirmation of the supply quantity from the Rice and Grain Joint Cooperative before announcing the allocation quantity and date for the 45th period of household rice.</p>
<p>More than 170,000 Bags of Flour Allocated to the Noodle Industry. It is heard that the local noodle and cooked food industry has submitted for approval to the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Commercial Control General Association, and has reached an agreement with the Flour Industry Association. Flour will soon be allocated to members. It is found that there are a total of 2,721 members who are eligible for allocation, and the quantity of flour to be allocated is 170,525 bags, which can be received in full soon and allocated.</p>
<h3>A Grand Shanghai March Concert: A Record of the Event</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Propaganda Department, in celebration of the recovery of the concessions, and in conjunction with the China Film United Company, organized the unprecedented Grand Shanghai March Concert. It was held yesterday (the 22nd) at 10:30 AM at the Grand Theater. The event was a grand spectacle, filled with enthusiastic sentiment, and attended by no fewer than three thousand people from all walks of life. Mayor Chen himself graced the occasion with his presence.</p>
<p>Director Liang's Address</p>
<p>He stated that the Grand Shanghai March Concert was profoundly meaningful, a cry of awakening for the new Shanghai. It served as an exchange of public sentiment for all of Shanghai, becoming the sound of footsteps marching forward for a grand Shanghai. Shortly after, the musical program began. The national anthem was played. The orchestra performed a Grand Shanghai March Overture, a symphonic poem. It was conducted by Professor Fu Hua and performed by the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra. Female soprano solos followed, including "Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds Theme Song" by local singer Ling Zhi, "Storm Symphony" by Yao Li, "Flying Swallows" by Xu Qian, "Concept of Autumn" by Man Ping, "Autumn Night" by Zhang Lu, "Good Morning Light" by Jia Xia, "Romana" by Ouyang Fei Ying, "Quiet Song" by Anti Ge, and "Sugar Song" by Abella, accompanied by the Contralas Orchestra and conducted by Contralas. A female chorus, including Ms. Liang Ping, Rou Yun, Yun Yun, Su Qin, Yi Jin, Zhu Mei, Li Li, Qin Yan, and Han Qing, sang "Fraternity Song," accompanied by the Contralas Orchestra and conducted by Liang Le. During the intermission, we respectfully requested</p>
<p>Mayor's Address</p>
<p>He said, "The Shanghai I imagined in the past was one where the streets at two or three in the morning were still filled with revelers, intoxicated and extravagant, emerging from singing halls and dance floors. I never imagined that today, in the bright morning light, this place would be filled with enthusiastic crowds. This morning air is filled with vigorous vitality, making me entrust unlimited expectations to all of Shanghai." After the speech, Mayor Chen presented the "Grand Shanghai March" composition award. Liang Rongyin bowed and accepted the award. The music program continued with male and female soprano solos of "Grand Shanghai March," with lyrics personally written by Mayor Chen and music composed by Liang Rongyin, sung successively by Mr. Li Leming and Miss Mei Ying. Female soprano solos included "Boat Song" by China Film star Wang Danfeng, "Spring Love" by Bai Hong, "Spring Love" by Chen Qi, "Quit Smoking Song" by Zhang Fan, "Don't Forget Tonight" by Gong Qiuwei, and "Roses Everywhere." Finally, all the stars sang a grand chorus of "Grand Shanghai March," accompanied by the municipal government military band and conducted by Captain Shi Fengzhou. Each piece was met with thunderous applause from the entire audience.</p>
<p>Senior Officials of Two Districts Hold a Meeting; Deputy Director Chen Personally Instructs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality's First and Eighth District Public Offices and the First and Third Police Bureaus held a senior official meeting at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday in the First District Public Office's meeting room. Over fifty people attended, including the chief secretaries of the First and Eighth District Public Offices, Wu Songbi and Zhao Zunyue, the supervising officers, and the heads of various departments from the First and Third Police Bureaus. Deputy Director Chen then gave instructions on various policy principles to be implemented in the future, providing detailed guidance, and addressed issues requiring attention in finance, donations, public works, sanitation, education, and other areas, so that the relevant responsible personnel would know what to follow.

<h3>Cotton Cloth Rationing Per Capita Expected Soon; Specific Measures Still Not Disclosed</h3>
<p>According to inquiries from reliable sources by the Times reporter, the authorities are now paying attention to the matter of rationing cotton cloth per capita. It is expected that the per capita rationing plan will begin to be implemented within this month. At the same time, unregistered cotton cloth inventories have been allowed to be re-registered within a 15-day period. As for how much cotton cloth each Shanghai resident can receive in each rationing, it is still unknown. However, according to a reliable estimate, the annual per capita consumption is about ten yards. But according to relevant sources, it is speculated that the implementation of the per capita cloth rationing plan will involve more than ten yards per person per year, and the price will also be lower than the current price.</p>
<p>Unified Cotton Cloth Tax to Be Changed</p>
<p>After the authorities implemented the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth this time, because the collection method of the unified cotton yarn and cloth tax is based on ad valorem tax, in order to adapt to the situation, the method of collecting cotton yarn and cloth will also be changed with the decline in the price of cotton yarn and cloth.</p>

<h3>Financial Affairs Office Supervises the Recovery of Illegally Issued Loans; Future Loans Must Comply with Ministry Regulations</h3>
<p>The Financial Affairs Office of the Central Reserve Bank, in order to suppress prices and crack down on hoarding, has been actively inspecting the loan situation of various financial institutions and ordering them to separately fill out detailed loan forms, which will be submitted to the office for detailed review. Many loans were not in compliance with the Ministry's regulations on loan restrictions. A special letter was sent to various financial institutions stating that, in the future, all kinds of loans must be strictly implemented in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, and those that have already been issued but do not comply with the Ministry's regulations should be recovered.</p>
<p>Original Letter</p>
<p>It reads: "The Ministry of Finance's measures to restrict loans from silver and money shops have long been circulated to the silver and money shop associations to be forwarded to the various financial institutions for compliance. Now, among the accounts listed in the detailed loan statements submitted to this office by the various financial institutions, many are in compliance with the Ministry's regulations, but there are also many loans that conflict with the Ministry's restrictive measures, which is contrary to the original intention of the Ministry of Finance to rectify finance. Therefore, a special letter is issued to the effect that, in the future, all supplementary loans must be strictly implemented in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, and those that have already been issued but do not comply with the Ministry's regulations should be recovered immediately and reported to this office at any time for verification."

<h3>Guidance Authority of the Rural Cooperative Movement in Central China Transferred to Chinese Control</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, the guidance authority of the rural cooperative movement in the central China region has been transferred to the Chinese authorities for implementation. The transfer of guidance authority was originally scheduled to be realized several months ago, but it was feared that the cooperative movement was not yet regularized and that an immediate transfer would easily lead to abuses. Therefore, the degree of trust of the members was studied and maintained first, until recently before the transfer was finalized.</p>
<p>Guiding Agriculture</p>
<p>However, both China and Japan still maintain some necessary cooperation in technical aspects. Since the Incident, up to the end of last year, the number of members in the cooperative enterprises in the central China region has reached more than 806,000, and has recently exceeded 1 million. In order to quickly increase agricultural production, the Central China Cooperative Society Guidance Committee has been starting to organize production mutual aid societies according to the Baojia units in various rural areas since March of this year. These mutual aid societies are lower-level organizations under the branch offices of the cooperative societies, handling</p>
<p>Low-Priced Distribution</p>
<p>The distribution of daily necessities such as fertilizers, guiding agricultural technology, lending low-interest funds to rural areas, and lending agricultural tools. Due to the importance of its work, the number of production mutual aid societies is already close to a thousand. It has also been helpful in the work of purchasing agricultural products. For example, during the silkworm season, the alleyway farmers belonging to the 15 production mutual aid societies in Zhejiang provided all of their affairs to the China Central Business Company and the cooperative societies. The cooperative movement is not only enough to revive the Chinese countryside,</p>
<p>Increase Production and also facilitate the purchase of production materials. Now that the guidance authority has been transferred to the Chinese side, it is a clear manifestation of the sincere unity between China and Japan.</p>
<h3>Intensified Control; Prices Fall Last Week</h3>
<p>The financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai last week were gradually stabilized under the authorities' strengthened control policy. In particular, the government's implementation of the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, as well as other materials, caused hoarders to lower prices and release their goods, and the so-called black market transactions have completely disappeared. In the financial sector, the price of silver has also declined, the interbank lending rate is about two cents and four mills, and the market prices of public bonds and stocks have plummeted. Cotton yarn and cloth transactions have stalled, and prices have fallen sharply. Rice and miscellaneous grains have fallen. The government-set prices of various foodstuffs such as oil and sugar remain unchanged, and people's livelihood is stable. The rise in the price of matches and soaps has slowed down due to the implementation of unified distribution. Various factories have resumed work one after another, and the production volume has increased compared to before. Overall, the price decline in the market last week was more severe than before.</p>
<h3>Twelfth Installment of Cigarette Payments and Deliveries</h3>
<p>Strict Management and Price Limits</p>
<p>The Central China Tobacco Allocation Association has formulated strict measures to eliminate abuses by wholesalers and retailers and to crack down on black market transactions. After these measures were effectively implemented, the Shanghai newspaper learned from the association yesterday that: 1. The grading standards for confirmed distributors have been determined and adjusted accordingly. 2. Special inspectors are dispatched to check the accounts of each distributor to see if the daily sales of cigarettes are in accordance with regulations, whether there is price gouging or participation in black market activities. Violators will be temporarily suspended from allocation for minor violations and permanently suspended from allocation and punished for serious violations. 3. Cigarettes must be sold without the shell. The shells must be retained and submitted in full when picking up goods. Shortages will be regarded as participation in black market activities. 4. Cigarette vendors on the side of the road who specialize in selling black market cigarettes, as well as hooligans who specialize in pressing cigarettes, have been cracked down on. Buying empty shells at high prices for profit is also prohibited. It is also heard that the eleventh installment of goods has been completed, and the twelfth installment of goods will be notified for payment and pickup starting on the 25th. The quantity has been increased, and the price will remain temporarily stable.</p>
<p>Discussion on Blockade Business</p>
