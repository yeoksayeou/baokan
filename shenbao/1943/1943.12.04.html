<p>社評</p>
<h3>醫生與病家</h3>
<p>人類在生活過程中，難免發生疾病；疾病因感受的原因不一，而有不同的種類，醫治不同種類的疾病，就需要各種對症的方法。所以，從理論上言，醫病的醫生，各科萬能，是不可能的。反之，愈是分科細，愈是識騐精，治病就愈有把握。醫學原是科學，研究發明，永無止境。近世科學昌明的國家，對於醫學上的發明，誠是出神入化。對於人類生命之貢戲，殊足稱道。更可以說，醫學發達程度的遲速，與人類死亡率的高低，成正比例。</p>
<p>我們中國之有醫學，歷史悠久，不過，國人的傳統習慣，向來是保守的，醫學亦不例外，自近世紀西醫方法逐漸輸入之後，急進者視國醫方法爲陳腐，十年前會一度引起强烈論爭，我們對此問題姑不論列，可是，平心靜氣以思，「物必自腐，然後蟲生」，「優勝劣敗，物競天擇」，乃為極自然之理。國醫方法，尙未見有志之士，以近代科學方法研究整理，在科學上建立有價値的地位，不免是憾事。所以對於複雜病症祗有用西醫方法，解剖分析，才能原原本本，指出其所以然的原因。</p>
<p>上面說過：「醫學愈昌明，對於人類生命的貢獻愈大」。那末，醫生的學識技能愈高，對於病家的生命，就愈有保全的把握。而醫生的學識技能，一定是從孜孜兀兀，實騐臨症中磨練出來的。我們爲病家的生命，爲人類的幸福，當然希望社會上所有的醫生都具備高深的學識，與優良的技能。不過，醫生有了學識技能還嫌不够，同時，還需要醫德。什麼是醫德呢？簡單的說，要有「人病己病」的慈憫服務之心，而謹慎地設想最有效的治理方法，儘可能减少病家的痛苦。</p>
<p>上海一地，人口逾五百萬，在公共衛生素不注意的情形下，疾病比率相當的大，而醫生也較多，誠是國醫西醫，薈萃斯土，當然，其間有眞實學識技能，有高尙醫德者，不在少數。而一知半解，不識醫德，甚至江湖欺騙者，亦非絕無。而社會人心，叉極浮騷，因之關於醫生與病家的糾紛不時發生，甚有涉訟者，更因而有種種意外欺詐的傳聞。我們對此現象，認爲是現實的社會問題，有加以注視的必要。</p>
<p>第一，希望全市醫生厲行自肅，以寶貴的學識技能爲病家服務，注重醫德，這是人人尊敬的神聖職業。</p>
<p>第二，衛生當局於甄別醫生時，特別注意於學識技能，不被濫芋充數，貽誤病家。</p>
<p>第三，眞有學識技能的各科專家，對於病家症狀，認爲有施用手術必要，但無法保證絕對安全者，應向病家剴切說明，病家考慮決定後，應視醫生爲一家人而絕對信任之。</p>
<p>第四，司法機關受理醫生因職務上過失之案件，共過失之確定，應由法醫，必要時延聘公正的同科專門醫生協議，愼重判明其責任之所在與累重，以為審判之根據。未便僅憑常識臆斷，遽予定讞，致使醫生輩視職業而寒心。</p>
<p>我們的醫學在科學地位而言，尙在萌芽時代，不能讓有學問技術而有志硏究的醫生，為社會不良環境所威脅，而放棄其醫學上的研究及對人類生命的貢獻，同時，我們希望這輩醫生不必向環境屈伏，大家起來爲醫學界與社會前逮創造光明！</p>
<h3>中日滿三國決定互派遣興亞使節　高橋大川兩氏即由日來華</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　中、日、滿三國，今夏于新京舉行第二次興亞團體會議時，曾決定互派與亞使節，日本方面頃決定于大東亞戰爭二週年紀念日，派遣興亞連絡本部顧問高橋三吉海軍大將赴華北蒙疆。興亞述絡本部協力會議員法學博士大川周明氏赴華中，充第一次興亞使節，于各地主要都市，召開興亞大講演會。又對滿洲國亦已決定最近派遣使節。又中、滿兩國亦預定於明年一月及三月，分別派遣興亞使節來日。</p>
<h3>翼贊會講堂中　來栖氏演說　暴露美造成戰爭謀略</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　前負責日。美交涉之來栖大使，三日上午十時在大政翼贊會講堂，對翼贊會地方支部指導者三百餘人講演，題爲「剖解戰爭眞因之美國白皮書」。以美國前次發表之外交白皮書「戰爭與和平」爲題材，加以解剖暴露美國白皮書爲虛僞宣傳之典型，並批評其戰爭與和平之內容，除對戰爭之遠近及直接原因詳加說明，並列舉美國於第一次大戰以來所取之壓迫日本政策。指出美國白皮書中所未言及之三點，即　形成此次戰爭遠因之第一次大戰後，美國十年問所取之外交壓迫政策，　此次戰爭暴發前數年間，美政府之挑釁政策，　日美交涉記述中各種重大歪曲掩飾等，而粉碎美國宣傳謀略。最後並指出美國缺乏戰爭目的之原因稱：根據白皮書所載，美國事前B深悉共經濟壓迫，定必引起日本報復，而演成戰爭，蓋當戰爭爆發之前，美駐日大使格魯於十一月三日致電羅斯福，警告若以經濟壓迫手段，而防止在東亞發生戰爭，實屬錯誤。格魯又慮及日本之團民性　，此手段反將引起戰爭。又十一月十七日格魯復電吿事態之危急，但美政府匪特不納格魯之言，而接受日本之提案，反於十一月二十六日提出所謂最後通牒，以壓迫日本，美政府此種政策，實不能不謂爲製造戰爭之策謀。來栖大使繼謂：上月五·六·兩日，大東亞六國代表在東京舉行大東亞會議，發表大東亞宣言，實可謂建設大東亞之大憲章，吾人試就英美陣營對大東亞會議眞相極力作虛僞宜傳，以欺騙其民衆一事而觀，亦可知此種事實如何使英美陣營　駭不安矣。英美深恐日方於開發大東亞資源，而增强其戰力，且恐大東亞各民族之團結愈益鞏固，而不可動搖，乃於不與日本時機之標語下，屢次自各方面作猛烈之反攻。大東亞戰爭以前，美國屢作勿坐視渝方危難之宣傳。其後美國亦曾裝模作樣，今日彼等遂除去其假面具，竟完全爲擁護英，美自身之利益，而使渝方賣命。又關於菲律賓獨立事，羅斯福曾於十六日向國會提出咨文，要求授權提前使菲律賓獨立，吾人試詳讀其咨文，同時使菲律賓能以獨立乎，第二何以不單言獨立，而日獨立之法律地位乎，試以此點與古巴在法律上完全爲獨立國家，而被美國租借去坎大勞耶海軍基地一事相對照，則不難窺知美國之居心何在。再就印度問題而言，大東亞戰爭勃發後，克里浦斯自英國派往印度之時，美國一部人士，曾盛倡促進印度獨立之說，例如美國六大勞動團體，並一二國會議中有「爲獨立能以實現，則次第付與完全之自由獨立之法律地位」之言，又謂：「此獨立之地位應受保護」云云。吾人於茲深有疑惑，第一，美國即曾主張大西洋憲章得適用於印度，而美國政府則抑壓此種正當主張，不過當初美國固曾向英國爭取獨立之事實，驅使共人民爲妨害印度，緬甸之獨立，而從事戰爭，綜上所述，可知彼等之戰爭目的，實巳充滿矛盾。</p>
<h3>菲物價對策會强華海陸運輸</h3>
<p>馬尼刺三日中央社電　菲律賓國會曾於十月組織一物價對策委員會，以研討物價對策事宜，該委員會已强化海陸運輸方策，矯正物資畸形不均之現象，俾使運輸臻於完璧，　農具普遍配給農民，　努力提高經濟警察及其他統治關係人員之品德，　繼續實施市塲之調查及取締事宜，　賦與食糧管理局以權限與資金，　設置特別委員會，以研討通貨及銀行制度，　擴大各食糧配給之統制機構與權限，並强化收買網，使遍及於全國。</p>
<h3>泰國設置軍事評議會</h3>
<p>盤谷三日中央社電　參政府爲期遂行戰爭乃決設置戰爭評議會，二日人民議會開會時，提出設立案，全塲巳一致通過，泰國防相培齊德就提出該案之理由，說明此次戰時評議會乃於戰時下研究軍事，政治，經濟及增進國民福祉之中央機關，評議委員主以閣僚軍人首腦部充任，至戰爭終了後，即停止其活動。</p>
<h3>印度獨立鬥爭　預務階段完成　鮑斯在昭南發表演說</h3>
<p>昭南三日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯，昨下午六時出席於昭南市公署前廣塲舉行之印度民衆大會時發表演說稱：吾等一部軍隊刻已進至印緬國境，近將更有多數軍隊向國境方面進軍。今印度獨立鬥爭之預備階段已全達成，並具備獲得勝利所必要之條件，不久印度東部即可解放印人，則能任意出入。印臨時政府成立後，印度獨立抗爭於政治經濟上之前提條件即吿成熟，英印軍之大部亦均支持此自由鬥爭。總之印度內外均已開始最後之鬥爭，且巳有可使此鬥爭獲勝之準備。又大東亞會議宣言，已奠定開拓東亞建設新秩序之基礎，並於會議中決議於印度將來展開獨立鬥爭時，予以全面援助，日政府並已聲明擬將安達曼及尼科巴羣島劃歸自由印度臨時政府，余曾對此表示最大謝意，同時希望全束亞印人一致團結，典日本及各盟邦繼續奮鬥，俾獲最後勝利。</p>
<h3>里斯科姆貝號　美承認沉沒　此為美最新航空母艦</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城三日中央社　電據華盛頓來電，傳美當局發表，護送航空母艦里斯科姆貝號，已於十一月二十四日在吉爾貝特羣島海面被日海軍擊沉云云。此外仍未言及其他損害，衆料美政府或擬發表一部損害，以欺瞞世界。按里斯科姆貝號，乃美最新之航空母艦，係於一九四三年在溫哥華進水者。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據海迪社訉，紐約昨息：莫登中　所統率之美國潛艇「伐　」號業已沉失，莫登爲美國潛艇健將，據稱曾擊沉日船十九艘。</p>
<p>北婆羅洲印人奮起</p>
<p>古署三日中央社電印獨立聯盟北婆羅洲支部前曾組織第二批義勇軍，經嚴選結果，已選拔若干名，茲爲歡送彼等加入鮑斯主席統帥之印度國民軍起見，特於一日晚在此間舉行壯行會，情况熱烈。</p>
<h3>義共和國　呈更生氣象　壯丁召集入伍</h3>
<p>羅馬三日中央社電　義國國民自巴特里奧政權投降後，即陷於大混亂狀態，其後經一度之勞力，復組成法西斯新黨，準備舉行憲法議會，採用社會政策，並將首那各機關遷至義北，在在均表現義國更生之氣象。墨索里尼元首對義國復興事業夙夜計劃，自國防部長葛拉齊亞尼參謀總長甘巴拉將軍及空軍次長波特上校等分別就任以來爲再整編已瓦解之義軍．曾作極大之努力，葛拉齊亞尼就任時，曾令全國將士速向原隊本部報到，同時並召集一九二四及一九二五兩年出生之壯丁，此等壯丁已自十一月二十二日起開始報到。據參謀總長甘巴拉將軍談，由於此次召集壯丁，可得三十萬新兵云。又與巴特里奧同時投入反軸心陣營之前海長庫爾廷之子年方十八歲，當休戰翌日，郎率同學投入李提將軍率領之民軍充義勇軍，目下正受士官敎育。</p>
<h3>日本國民　努力儲蓄　總額超過一千億元</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日本國民爲完遂大東亞戰爭，一致以不屈不撓之精神，繼續努力奪鬥，即在儲蓄方面，亦已獲驚人之成績，本年度儲蓄目標額，爲三百七十億圓，預料定可超過。十二月以來，日本全國儲蓄運動之推進，更趨積極，預料本年度目標達成以後，則與中日事變勃發以來七年問日本國民之儲蓄總額，將超過一千億元．日本國民踴躍儲蓄，足可彌補過去七年來日本巨額戰費之支出，而日本國家財政賴以穩若磐石，此一千億元儲蓄，以日本一億國民攤派，每人攤一千元之譜，日本國民之努力，於此可見一斑。</p>
<h3>印僑大會議決　致謝日首相</h3>
<p>東京三B中央社電　印度獨立聯盟東京支部，二日在此問山王飯店召開旅日印僑大會，到自由印度臨時政府最高顧問比哈利鮑斯及印僑四十餘人，當塲一致決議致謝日政府及致謝日東條首相等議案。致謝東條首相決議文要旨如次：本日印度獨立聯盟東京支部，召開印僑大會，決議對閣下宣布以安達曼及尼科巴兩羣島贈與自由印度臨時政府深表謝忱。此兩羣島必將成爲自由印度臨時政府獨立鬥爭之不動基礎，又我等印僑旣承貴政府全面援助，　決爲解放祖國努力奮鬥外，並願協力貴國軍隊，以爭取大東亞戰爭之最後勝利。</p>
<h3>蘇淮雜糧輸出　須獲許可</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　蘇淮特別區經濟局，頃令飭各縣辦事處，關於各項雜糧，自即日起，在地區以內准予移動。向地區以外輪出時，如無許可，絕對禁止。執有本年十一月以前所發許可證，　屬無效。</p>
<h3>以堅忍不撓精神　求最後勝利　德宣傳部長勗勉國人</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　據海通社訉：德宣傳部長郭培爾在最近一期之「國家週刊」上著稱，堅忍爲戰事中最重要之元素，因單憑勇敢與謹慎，不足以達到最後之目標，爲生存而戰之民族必須具有堅忍性。蓋勝利之獲得，常爲艱苦與勞力之報酬。該文之題名爲「戰事之教訓」，郭培爾續吿其讀者稱，當國家無危險時，其人民始可安居樂業，以其民族之安全寄托於外國之國家，其國必亡。在戰事中受戰之人，其「榮譽」之創痕，始足以誇耀於儕輩。郭氏最後申述排斥投降思想之重要性稱，不具此念之民族，必可獲得最後勝利。</p>

<h3>日軍在常德作戰　予渝方大打擊　派遣軍發表一週戰况</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　渝第六戰區重要據點常德縣城之渝軍，自日軍精銳攻入該城以來，八日間不斷作頑强抵抗。及至三日，因日軍之陸空猛攻，其抵抗力似巳消沈。渝軍頑抗八日，實屬罕見，茲舉其頑抗理由如次：　渝軍當局曾誤斷日軍此次作戰，僅爲威嚇作戰，始終未預料日軍進攻第六戰區之心臟部。第一期作戰渝第七十三，七十九兩軍，即被日軍擊潰。第二期作戰日軍使渝第五十七六十三兩師，在常德縣城附近陷於孤立，終被消滅。　渝軍誤斷日軍在南太平洋作戰，及印度洋發生戰事，實無餘裕在大陸戰綫，展開如次此之大規模作戰且　美駐渝空軍實力之估計過大，受英美軍首腦部之督戰激勵，而有此舉。此次作戰，已使英美及渝方充分明瞭南太平洋戰局，無論如何激烈，毫不影　日軍在大陸作戰，常德之役，實予渝方今後之抗戰以一大打擊。</p>
<p>南京三日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍於三日發表一週戰况如次：向洞庭湖西方地區進攻之日軍，於開始進攻以來，巳二旬於茲，擊破渝中央直系軍兵力約十萬人對於渝軍據守之重要據點常德，加以猛攻，刻正在常德城內掃蕩渝軍。又日軍另一强力部隊，在龍陽地區圍攻，企圖救援常德，而攻日軍側背之張漢明方先覺所指揮之二軍數師兵力二日以來到處展開包圍殲滅戰，完全擊破其企圖。又華南方面日軍，於二十六日以來，在汾夾三角洲地區開始肅淸戰，擊潰渝方游擊隊約一千人，收獲極大戰果，達到所期目的。又日機協力地上部隊，於二日急襲遂川南雄各處，炸燬渝軍事設施，及各機塲滑走路，並與淪機P/40型P51型十餘架交戰，擊落　其七架，（內有四架未經證實）。炸燬地上B/25型機一架，日機自炸者一架。又日空軍於本月一日，迎擊來襲香港地區之美渝空軍B/25型P/40型機十餘架，確實擊落其B/40型機七架。</p>
<p>日機隊襲遂川南雄機塲</p>
<p>九江三日中央社電</p>
<p>本月二日日駐華航空部隊，以轟炸機戰鬥聯合編隊，轟炸江西省　川及廣東省雨雄飛機塲獲得　大戰果。緣日本航空隊於二日下午，以轟炸機戰鬥機聯合編隊，轟炸遂川，與敵機數十架交緩，結果擊落（P40）型（P51）型共七架，已經證實者三架，未經證實者四架，另有二架則因受重創遁去。日方轟炸機於擊潰敵機羣後，投下大量炸彈，對飛機場滑走路及重要設施予以莫大損害，並炸毀停泊該機塲之小型機一架。日方損失自炸飛機一架。又同時日另一航空隊，仍以戰門機轟炸機聯合編隊，往炸廣東南雄機塲，該處僅有地上少數砲火應戰，日機得從容投彈，炸毀滑走路及（B25）型機一架。</p>
<h3>德軍冒風雪　防禦戰順利　北翼蘇軍攻勢被遏阻</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　德國新聞社訉：東綫天氣繼續惡劣，雨雪間作，使各公路泥濘難行，而行軍大受阻碍。但星期三日南路與中路之德軍，仍進行猛烈之反攻。在斯摩倫斯克以西作戰之德軍，對敵步兵二十八個師團與坦克車二百輛以上，獲得防禦上卓著之勝利。德軍在尼維爾河套之進攻，續有進展，德空軍不斷轟炸蘇軍之砲位，對於德軍之勝利買獻頗大，克里米亞半島與尼科波爾橋頭，僅有局部戰事活動。</p>
<p>聶伯河奪前綫蘇軍大量增援</p>
<p>同時蘇軍在大聶伯河套之攻勞，其　張之程度已見減退克里曼卓格之南與西南戰事似更趨活躍，蘇軍在該區調到强大之增援軍，並迫使德軍不得不向後撤退，但所有敵暫時突破之一切缺口，均在德軍猛攻中予以地平，而主要之戰綫，亦仍堅守在德軍手中。德軍於星期二日在契爾喀賽所發動之反攻，續有進展，德軍一集團被包圍在該區者已歷數日，現已獲得解圍而立即加入反攻之德軍。蘇軍由防禦堅强之陣地若干處被逐出，該區戰事仍在繼續中。齋托密爾與若輔之間，並無重要之戰事發生。</p>
<h3>成立逾月的　自由印度政府</h3>
<p>以江特拉，鮑斯爲領袖的自由印度臨時政府，自十月廿一日樹立以來，已逾一月，逐漸以進攻德里爲目標而突入戰鬥的階段。今檢討一個月來該政府的經過，在該政府之國際地位的確立上，及政府並印度軍國民本身的强化上，頗堪注目。該政府樹立後三日，即已得日本的承認，毅然對英美佈告宜戰。中國，滿洲國，德國，義國，緬甸，菲列濱，克羅地，泰國等亦相繼承認，合計已和九個國家結成友邦關係。鮑斯領袖更親自訪問東京，列席大束亞會議，和各國代表一同宣誓實行歷史的大東亞宣言。歸途訪問中國，待以國賓，目覩新生中國的實相，見聞某於道義而規定中日友好關係的中日同盟條約的悄神及其實行，使鮑斯領袖愈加鞏固其印度完全獨立的決心，以貫獻於東亞共榮圈的確立。同時，在確立國際的地位上，也有不少幫助。</p>
<p>就該政府本身而言，經連日閣議的決定，簡素有力的政府機構，日進於戰鬥的運營，創設準備進駐印度境內的都隊，爲使國民軍兵土無後顧之憂，組織內閣委艮會，以樹立恩賞制度，遺族家族扶助制度。</p>
<p>印度人民的熱忱</p>
<p>前次東條首相聲明歸還安達曼，尼科巴爾島後，因獲得領土，政府的實體勢力增加，更昻揚了印度人支援政府的熱忱。人的，物的總力之結合，着着收得實效。因而印度國民單的士氣、頓趨旺盛，給與敵方非常的威脅。據新德里廣播，最近國民軍的勢力，巳不能輕視，而說「國民軍是强制編成的傀儡軍隊」，具在另一方面英印軍對印度兵不加信賴，印度人的前綫部隊，使與駐印中國軍交代，以隔斷印度軍的特務工作。這一着不啻自己說明了印度國民軍之果敢的戰鬥任務之增加。</p>
<p>印度人之志願應暮國民軍者，連日經猛烈的戰鬥訓練，不斷地叫喊着進攻德里。鮑斯領袖從日本及東亞各盟邦協力支援的確約後而返任後，此勢更如火燎原，蔓延開來，擊減英美，完成印度之完全獨立的自由印度臨時政府的勢力，今後可望將有更進一步的發展。（翔：譯自十一月二十四日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>南太平洋日軍戰果　創歷史上新紀錄　為世界戰史上最燦爛之一頁</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　南太平洋方面之盟邦日軍，近又捷報頻傳，我國上下歡欣欽佩之餘，對於該方面戰局之攻續，亦　形注意。綜觀過去一月間，日軍所獲之偉大戰果，實爲世界戰史上最燦爛之一頁。蓋自十月二十七日摩諾島海面大戰，至十一月二十九日第四次吉爾貝特羣島海面空戰止，敵美艦艇損害，計沉失戰艦四艘，大型航空母艦三艘，中型航空母艦八艘，大型巡洋艦九艘，驅逐艦二十艘，艦型未詳者兩艘等二艘，大型航空母艦二艘，中型航空母艦三艘，大型巡洋艦五艘，巡洋艦一艘，中型運輸船三艘，小型運輸船二艘，及其他舟艇甚夥。如計算建艦之費用，實達百億餘美元，喪失人員亦有二萬數千餘。</p>
<p>美國在大東亞戰爭爆發前，共有戰艦十五艘，航空母艦五艘，甲乙級巡洋艦三十五艘，逐艦二百二十三艘，則在此一月間，美國戰艦即已損失四成。航空母艦不僅完全喪失，且新造之十艘，亦已沉失。此種數字，實超過上次大戰中德國與協約國所喪失海上勢力之總和，堪爲歷史所朱有之新紀錄。美國於戰爭爆發以前，曾積極計劃造艦有三次，「文生案」及「史帶克案」等，預定於一九四六年未完成戰艦二十二艘，航空母艦十八艘，巡洋艦八十八艘，驅逐艦三七四艘，潛水艇一九四艘。美國爲完成此計劃，乃極力擴充造船廠，養成熟練工人，搜集資材等。但至去年，又採取航空母艦中心全義，將戰艦巡洋艦商船等，改裝爲航空母艦，故其建艦計劃巳有若干變更。茲估計其全部勢力，則有戰艦三十艘，航空母艦二十至二十五艘，補助航空母艦十至十五艘，巡洋艦八十九艘，驅逐艦三七四艘，潛水艇一九三艘。</p>
<p>假定美國之建艦計劃預定於一九四六年完成，當能於本年底全部完成，如將自珍珠灣一役以來爲日軍所擊沉之美艦艇，計戰艦十七艘，航空母艦二十七艘，巡洋艦八十二艘，驅逐艦八十四艘，潛水艦一二八艘自其總數中扣除後，則美海軍所殘留船舶僅戰艦十三艘，航空母艦連同劣弱之補助航空母艦在內，共約十艘左右。巡洋艦七艘，驅逐艦二九〇艘，潛水艇六十五艘，即或其擁有艦艇之數目，較　人所估計者爲多。但事實上目前美國仍須以多數補助艦艇，作輸送援助英蘇物資之用，而必須固定配置於大西洋上，因此現時列米茲大將所統率之太平洋聯合艦隊之實力，必遠遜於戰前。且幾無一艘未曾遭受日海空軍之猛擊，而負創纍纍。故事實上，其所統率之艦隊，因殘破不堪一擊。</p>
<p>羅斯福爲企圖雄覇世界起見，不惜舉國作孤注之一擲。但彼選擇日本之忠勇將士爲其對手，實可謂爲彼之最大不幸。美國作戰本部其所以不惜作如斯重大之犧牲，企圖突破太平洋之一隅，以期迫近日本本土者，蓋因鑒於美國國內軍需產業之生產數，刻已達於最高限度。縱其對於動用資源及勞力作若何之努力，亦無從再使其增加。反之日水因於過去兩年間曾不斷積極開發南方資源，以高速度力謀增產，故共生產能力，刻已與美國相埒。至一九四趨勢，因此若戰事愈遷延時是，則美國必陷於無從自拔之境地，事實固極為明顯也。</p>
<h3>德準備在海峽對岸　使用火箭彈炸英　柏林又遭恐怖空襲</h3>

<p>柏林三日中央社電　德國新聞社訉：英機復於昨晚襲攻此間，被擊落者有三十架，損失空軍人員一百四十六名。德戰鬥機大編隊在不同之高度下，飛翔於柏林四郊，直至伊爾員河，英機來去時，柏林市上空發生激烈空戰。高射砲及探照燈協力合作極有成效。</p>

<h3>日陸軍發言人　談開羅會議　一紙公報如痴人說夢</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日陸軍　道部發言人，昨（三）日招待記者時，曾就此次難邱渝蔣開羅會談，說朋其用意所在。</p>
<p>會談失敗暴露無遺</p>
<p>略謂：蔣介石夫婦參加羅邱之所謂開羅會談後，已於十二月一日偕同隨員十餘名歸抵重慶，渝方之宜傳自由，似已完全爲英美所剝奪，渝蔣歸抵重慶後之宣傳，亦無足動聽，由開羅會議閉慕後，所發表之公報而觀，如興我方之以選義爲其礎之人東亞共同宣言相較，誠知痴人說夢，大有天壞之別，開羅會談之失敗，由此暴露無遺。本來開羅會談出於英美之策略，當初曾熱烈宣傳，謂史太林亦將參加，然結果卒歸失敗，因英美在太平徉海域之連續慘敗，所予反軸心國民之影饗極大，應如何加以挽救，尤以緬甸非律賓之獨立，印度臨時政府之樹立，中日同盟，大東亞共同宣言等消息，先後傳插，其狼狽之窘狀，誠不容掩飾，此時應如何防止渝方脫離陣營，實為其此次會談之主要目的，由此亦可見英美對大東亞戰爭之焦慮不安，會談公報　勢將成爲不負責任範絡渝方之甘餌，惟恐難以爲渝方知理之士所取信耳</p>
<p>任何戰塲均無進展</p>
<p>彼等所感焦燥不安之對日反攻作戰，衣任何戰塲，均遲遲朱見進展，緬甸反攻僅爲宣傳，除犧牲雲南國境之渝軍外，實無任何發展，英國則辯稱爲準備尚未完成，　勿可笑．太平洋方面之進攻，亦已進入臼軍之制定圈以內，美軍之損害，究非以往所可同日而語，且衣吉爾貝特之泰拉叫島，馬金島登陸之美軍，均成爲臼軍出血戰術之對象。此後美爲保持其體面起見，必將急謀補充，然此正爲日軍所希望，美究能忍而多久，誠　疑問也。至中國方面戰塲第六戰區軍　據點之常德，佔領僅爲時日問題，目下正在城內掃蕩殘敗渝軍中，渝軍之反攻似亦相常頑强，此蓋常德城已爲日軍所到國，渝軍退路全告斷絕，勢非出於頑抗不可，因之日軍之戰果，日見增大。美空軍雖時或出動協助渝軍作戰，然仍因不諳地理之故，致時有誤炸渝軍情事發生。又第九第七戰區方面，亦有若干軍隊前來應援，現亦正逐一個別加以擊被中。總之，常德爲日軍最初之進攻地區，月爲進入重慶之要隘，其命運所　，對於戰略固有莫大關係，即對於精神物質雙方之影響，亦極爲重大也。</p>
<h3>廣田部長檢討　現階段戰事　反軸心短期作戰計劃絕望</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日本大使館上海事務所廣田情報部長，於昨（三）日下午三時，在陸海外聯合報道常會席上，發表值茲大東亞二週年紀念日，囘願二年問之戰果，及檢討現階段之戰事與今後之展望，茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>作戰經驗</p>
<p>廣田氏首謂「本月八日，爲大東亞戰爭一一週年紀念日，預定該日作盛大之慶祝行事，廻顧我方二年來之戰果，並對現階段之戰爭與今機之展望，特作一簡單之檢討，大東亞戰爭發生以來，已屆二週年，在此時問較短，而日水在大東亞戰爭未發生前，日渝戰爭已四載半，而德國在歐洲作戰，亦有二戰，故日德兩國對作戰右頗久之經騐。蓋日本先後作戰六年有半，德國亦已逾四載，是以我軸心在世界戰爭之進行中，已展開大規模之作戰。在此二年中之進打，將照長期作戰上，尚爲極小之一部份。反觀敵反軸心方面之英美政治家，時向國內民間所說之現在作戰展開長期作戰之一點，在今所提之短期作戰，前後不無矛盾。前者反軸心因日所佔領區城之物資豐富，如果日本予以開發，及利用資源時，則日本之實力强大，英美決難以擊敗臼本，全圖不予日本有空餘之時問，開發資源，根據英美政洽家之所言，矛盾百出，任何入都可窺見者，</p>
<p>矛盾理論</p>
<p>廣田氏繼分析敵政治家之矛盾點，謂反軸心不予日本空餘時問，當承認將爲日本所敗，此乃實事，故關於此次戰爭，以展開長期作戰之矛盾理論，返觀最近英美之戰力，尤以在南太平徉展開空襲，以可見不願長期作戰，期在短期內結束。彼輩之眞意原擬日本不能開發南徉資源，及不予以充足實力，蓋英美此種計劃完全失收無遣，　英美在大東亞戰爭戰生時，即已予擊敗，　南徉資源已露日所佔領，　南太平徉企圖反攻亦告敗北，故大東亞戰爭二年來之太平洋方面作戰結果，予以估計，敵所受之損失慘重，沉沒戰艦十七　，航空母艦二十八總，其仙被損毀者之數量達上述二倍以上，而我方之損失微小，二年來被況沒戰艦僅一艘，舫空母艦僅二艘。</p>
<p>戰果比例</p>
<p>最近我方之作戰紀錄，雙方戰果之比例，以英美之戰艦航空母艦之一艘沉沒，我方祇須三四架飛機可予擊減，故敵方之如此重大犧牲，猶誇大宣傳，欲奪囘南洋，太平徉，吉爾員特鳥，理金島，泰拉哇島，且擬確保瑪泰兩島。查該兩島面積奇小。長二公里半，寬僅半公里，竟予集中攻擊，但至今猶於空襲，未有積極性之攻擊。常彼董之誇大宣傳，有一島奪一島之名目，以攻擊日本土，按照此項作戰，可觀以往之情形，即使能被其達到目的，則更須耗費極大之損失，且需數十倍之損害及時問，目前美國方面所損失之戰艦，航空母艦數量，已與大東亞戰爭發生前所建設老粗等，如再欲擴大建造海戰艦隊更須相當時問。參照建設戰艦專門家所言，趁造戰艦需三年，建造航空母艦需一載半，故彼幣欲攻擊日本之所用艦隊，其趁造時間，不知砍待何時，此事當更難於完成。</p>
<p>日本有利</p>
<p>由此而觀，彼輩之長期作戰，更難實現，而日軍　實力之强大．即可實現。戰爭愈延長，日軍力量恢後益速，大東亞戰爭於日本有利。益已顯明，故此爲日本相當順利之眞正條件。同時歐洲戰局，亦可言同樣之情形，反軸心方面極願將作戰短期結東，其不願長期作戰理由頗多，而德國對長期作戰計劃早已完成，以是反軸心方面對德之結束短期作戰亦告不能。如今德在東綫作戰，已採取最短戰綫，易於守備，敵難以攻擊，在地理上最爲右利。爲確保起見，已編成整個戰綫，在義大利進行之反軸心英美軍，自本年九月上旬向義本土進攻日閱三月，在此期間，反軸心未右特別進步，故無特別發展。在德國面觀，反軸心之攻擊數景頗小，僅幾個師團，且特別注意多鳥海，及希臘土耳其問之內海所右各島，如洛路司島，薩瑪司島。以及各主要各島，均爲德軍所佔領，德軍此次佔領上述各島，英美軍已不能佔領希臘等各主要地，且更不能經社特納司海峽，以及至黑海，故束綫戰局及義大利戰綫，巴爾幹戰綫，反軸心無特別戰果。數年內解決德國之反軸心誇大妄舉，亦已付之東流。故我人於大東亞戰局及歐洲戰局而觀，反輛心計劃之短期作戰，完全絕望，而軸心國長期作戰之勝利，已逐漸實現完成，我人在迎接大東亞戰爭週年紀念日之將臨，特將二年來大東亞戰爭之長期作戰所得之極小部份之理由，加以中連云云。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>工來的中心</h3>
<p>在當局飭令本市各業大小工廠　　工業生產聲中，我們願以工業的中心爲題，以爲研究增義問題之對象，本來，世界上的大工業是增壓的捷後；可是，中國工柴尚在幼　時代，根本即無大工業可言，以是今日之曾增加工柴生產者，胝可就輕工業與家庭手工業着眼，而不能談到大工業或重工業，這是戰時增加工業生產運動中的一個遣憾，自覺無可諱言。</p>
<p>我們鑒於中央社東　二日電稱，滿洲的重工業，最近正在飛躍進展之中，其鋼鐵堵產之數量，發電所電量之龐大，人造豆油工業之步八於正式企業化時代、在在都足令人欣羨，認爲可望而不司及，而滿洲之重工業躍進以外，同時共機械工業與化學工業，亦有驚人發展，刻正自原料工業向成品工業時代猛進中。返麗中國，則仍覺瞠乎其後，言之不勝慨然！</p>
<p>照馬克思的學理，世界上的大工業要靠生產，生產又要靠資本家，其理誠是。可是，中國最大的工業，以前也曾有過一個漢治萍公司，旣有銅鐵的好出產，又有雄厚之資本，而其結果仍歸失敗，可知工業的重心，猶不專在於生產的工廠，而是在於消費的社會，所以近代世界上的大工業，都是照消費者的需要來製造物品。因此，我們感覺如何機充生產的基層問應，在於如何增强消費的社會，就是解決眾人的生存的問題，否則，擴充生產在事實上是不切實際的。總之一句話，工業的中心，要靠消費的社會。</p>
<h3>特殊性存款　免收準備金　檢査金融處規定八種</h3>

<h3>寫在煤球配給實施前</h3>
<p>— 成</p>
<p>据報載，出局將積極提早實驗煤球配給，這對於我們　給階級的小市民，當然是一個喜訊。不過鑒於過去幾項必富品的配給，並不能如我們所意想中的美滿，　以對於今次煤球的配給！希望當局能夠策劃週全、而對於下列諸點尤望於可能範別內做到之。</p>
<p>數量　煤球既缺少代替品，而上海居民的飯，榮，水以及一切熱食東西，又什九取級於煤球爐，所以其配給數量，必須要能滿足一般市民的最低需要。　筆者調查，普通近十口一家的居戶，其煤康消耗量月約四五擔之評，易言之，每人每月的盟要，大約在四五十斤間。故當局配給數景若與此過於懸殊、則市民不敖應用，自必設法從他方面求得。這樣，黑市要求其撲　，恐難奏效。再則即使可以撲　，那麼數百萬市民的燃料問題又如何解決之。反之，恐慌固然消除，而黑市亦無由存在。要做到這點，還望出局對於原料的來源積極使其暢通，而對於不必要的消耗予以限制。</p>
<p>質量　煤球的製成，除煤屑外，還有黃泥等混合衣內，其問的配給比率本有一定。可是圖近爲了煤球恐慌的形成，若干廠商都施其乘火打刦的故技、實行偷工減料，本來黑色的煤球，現在變成了灰色、旣不經燒．燒起來又很費　•用戶大受其累。實施配給後，希望當局對於煤球成分予以一定的規定，並隨時派員至各廠家調查，如發現有取巧減、者，即予以嚴屬處分，以禁傚尢。</p>
<p>價格　售價當然希望最好能維持以前的限價，但萬一確因成本關係，即酌予增加亦屬不妨，我相信合理的漲價市民是決不會反對的。但最忌時常變動加價，因配給品的漲價是最容易剌激一般物價的上昇，此證諸過去，可知此言言並不虛設。</p>
<p>領取地點　煤球不若米，麵，食糖，肥皂等　便，數每以數十數百斤計，而且航面異常，擊取卞分不便，所以領取地點與領取人的居處應儘量使共接近，以資利便。切勿像食糖等使距離過遠，徒然增加人民的麻煩。</p>
<p>此外若每月配給次數的親定，對於經配處的管理等，都望右嚴密而合理的訂定，務使今次煤球的配給成續賴於理想。同時對於其他各項的配給，亦　能漸漸改營，俾吾儕平民生活得以安定，則幸甚矣。</p>

        <h1>1943.12.04</h1>
<h3>Doctors and Patients</h3>
<p>In the course of human life, illness is unavoidable. Illnesses arise from various causes and are of different types. To treat different types of illnesses, various methods tailored to the specific condition are required. Therefore, in theory, it is impossible for a doctor to be all-knowing and capable in every field of medicine. On the contrary, the more specialized the field, the more precise the knowledge and experience, the more confident the treatment. Medicine is a science, and research and discovery are endless. In modern scientifically advanced countries, medical discoveries are truly miraculous. Their contributions to human life are truly commendable. It can even be said that the speed of medical development is directly proportional to the decrease in human mortality rates.</p>
<p>China has a long history of medicine. However, the traditional habits of the Chinese people have always been conservative, and medicine is no exception. Since Western medical methods were gradually introduced in recent centuries, those who were quick to embrace change viewed traditional Chinese medicine as outdated. A heated debate once arose ten years ago. We will not discuss that issue here. However, if we think calmly, "things must rot from within before worms grow," and "the survival of the fittest" is a natural principle. It is regrettable that there are still no individuals with aspirations to study and organize traditional Chinese medicine using modern scientific methods and establish a valuable position for it in science. Therefore, for complex illnesses, only Western medical methods, with their dissection and analysis, can thoroughly point out the underlying causes.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, "the more advanced medicine is, the greater its contribution to human life." Then, the higher a doctor's knowledge and skills, the more confident one can be in preserving a patient's life. And a doctor's knowledge and skills must be honed through diligent and rigorous practice and clinical experience. For the sake of patients' lives and human happiness, we naturally hope that all doctors in society possess advanced knowledge and excellent skills. However, having knowledge and skills is not enough. Doctors also need medical ethics. What are medical ethics? Simply put, it is having a compassionate and caring heart that sees the patient's suffering as one's own, carefully considering the most effective treatment methods, and minimizing the patient's pain as much as possible.</p>
<p>Shanghai, with a population of over five million, has a relatively high rate of disease due to a general lack of attention to public health. There are also a large number of doctors, with both traditional Chinese and Western practitioners gathering here. Of course, there are many among them with genuine knowledge and skills and high medical ethics. However, there are also those who are half-baked, lack medical ethics, or are even outright charlatans. The public's mindset is also extremely restless, leading to frequent disputes between doctors and patients, even involving lawsuits, and rumors of various unexpected deceptions. We believe that this phenomenon is a real social problem that deserves attention.</p>
<p>First, we hope that all doctors in the city will strictly practice self-discipline, use their valuable knowledge and skills to serve patients, and emphasize medical ethics. This is a sacred profession that everyone respects.</p>
<p>Second, when the health authorities screen doctors, they should pay special attention to knowledge and skills, avoiding unqualified individuals who may harm patients.</p>
<p>Third, specialists in various fields who have genuine knowledge and skills should, when they believe surgery is necessary for a patient's condition but cannot guarantee absolute safety, explain this clearly to the patient. After the patient has considered and made a decision, they should treat the doctor as a member of the family and trust them completely.</p>
<p>Fourth, when judicial organs handle cases of doctors' negligence in their duties, the determination of negligence should be made by forensic doctors and, if necessary, by consulting impartial specialist doctors in the same field to carefully determine the extent of their responsibility as a basis for judgment. It is inappropriate to rely solely on common sense and conjecture to reach a verdict, lest doctors become disheartened with their profession.</p>
<p>Our medicine is still in its infancy in terms of scientific standing. We must not allow doctors with knowledge, skills, and a desire for research to be threatened by the adverse environment of society and abandon their medical research and contributions to human life. At the same time, we hope that these doctors will not succumb to the environment but will rise up together to create a bright future for the medical community and society!</p>
<h3>### China, Japan, and Manchukuo Decide to Dispatch Goodwill Envoys to Each Other; Mr. Takahashi and Mr. Okawa to Come to China from Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - During the second East Asia Groups Conference held in Hsinking this summer, China, Japan, and Manchukuo decided to dispatch goodwill envoys to each other. The Japanese side has decided to dispatch Admiral Sankichi Takahashi of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Advisor to the East Asia Liaison Headquarters, to North China and Mengjiang on the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Dr. Shumei Okawa, a legal scholar and member of the East Asia Liaison Headquarters Cooperation Association, will go to Central China as the first goodwill envoy, holding East Asia Grand Lecture Meetings in major cities. It has also been decided to dispatch an envoy to Manchukuo soon. China and Manchukuo are also scheduled to dispatch goodwill envoys to Japan in January and March of next year, respectively.</p>
<h3>### Mr. Kurasu Delivers Speech at Yokusankai Hall, Exposing American War Plot</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Former Ambassador Kurasu, who was in charge of the Japan-U.S. negotiations, delivered a speech at 10:00 a.m. at the Yokusankai Hall to more than 300 leaders of local branches of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. The title of the speech was "Analysis of the White Paper on the Causes of the War by the United States." Using the U.S. Department of State's published white paper "Peace and War" as material, he analyzed and exposed the American white paper as a typical example of false propaganda, and criticized its contents on war and peace. In addition to explaining the distance and direct causes of the war in detail, he listed the policies of oppression against Japan taken by the United States since World War I. He pointed out three points not mentioned in the American White Paper: 1. The diplomatic pressure policy adopted by the United States for ten years after World War I, which formed the remote cause of this war; 2. The provocative policies of the U.S. government in the years before the outbreak of this war; 3. Various major distortions and concealments in the descriptions of the Japan-U.S. negotiations, etc., in order to crush American propaganda plots. Finally, he pointed out the reason for the lack of war aims in the United States, saying: According to the White Paper, the United States knew well in advance that economic oppression would inevitably lead to Japanese retaliation and develop into war. Indeed, before the outbreak of the war, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew cabled Roosevelt on November 3, warning that it was a mistake to prevent war in East Asia by means of economic oppression. Grew also considered the solidarity of the Japanese people and thought that this means would cause war. On November 17, Grew cabled again, warning of the urgency of the situation, but the U.S. government not only did not accept Grew's words, but instead of accepting Japan's proposal, presented the so-called final ultimatum on November 26 to oppress Japan. This policy of the U.S. government can't be said to be a scheme to create war. Ambassador Kurusu continued: On the 5th and 6th of last month, representatives of the six countries of Greater East Asia held the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo and issued the Greater East Asia Declaration, which can be said to be the great charter for the construction of Greater East Asia. We can see how frightening this fact is to the Anglo-American camp by trying to see how the Anglo-American camp is doing its best to make false statements about the truth of the Greater East Asia Conference in order to deceive its people. The British and Americans are deeply afraid that Japan will develop Greater East Asia's resources and increase its war power, and that the unity of the nations of Greater East Asia will become more and more consolidated and unshakeable. Therefore, under the slogan of not giving Japan a chance, they have repeatedly made fierce counterattacks from all sides. Before the Greater East Asia War, the United States repeatedly made propaganda not to sit idly by and watch the difficulties of the Chongqing regime. Later, the United States also pretended to be a model. Today, they have removed their masks and are completely devoted to protecting the interests of Britain and the United States themselves and making the Chongqing regime sell its life. Regarding the independence of the Philippines, Roosevelt submitted a message to Congress on the 16th, requesting authorization to advance the independence of the Philippines. We should read its message in detail. At the same time, can the Philippines be independent? Second, why not just say independence, but instead say the legal status of independence? By comparing this point with the fact that Cuba is legally a completely independent country, but the United States has leased the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, it is not difficult to see what the United States is up to. As for the Indian issue, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, when Cripps was sent to India by Britain, some people in the United States strongly advocated promoting Indian independence. For example, the six major labor organizations in the United States and one or two members of Congress said, "In order to achieve independence, the legal status of complete freedom and independence will be granted in order." They also said: "This independent status should be protected," and so on. We have deep doubts about this. First, the United States once argued that the Atlantic Charter could be applied to India, but the U.S. government suppressed this legitimate claim. However, the United States once fought for independence from Britain, driving its people to hinder the independence of India and Burma and engage in war. In summary, it can be seen that their war aims are full of contradictions.</p>
<h3>### Philippine Price Control Committee Strengthens China-Philippine Maritime and Land Transportation</h3>
<p>Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Philippine Congress organized a Price Control Committee in October to study price control measures. The committee has strengthened maritime and land transportation strategies to correct the uneven distribution of materials, so that transportation can be perfect, universally distribute agricultural implements to farmers, strive to improve the morality of economic police and other ruling officials, continue to implement market investigations and crackdowns, give the Food Administration the authority and funds, set up special committees to study currency and banking systems, expand the control institutions and powers of each food distribution, and strengthen the buying network to spread throughout the country.</p>
<h3>### Thailand Establishes Military Council</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The San government decided to set up a War Council in order to carry out the war. When the People's Assembly met on the 2nd, it submitted a proposal to establish the Council. The whole field has unanimously passed it. Thai Defense Minister Pei Qide explained the reasons for submitting the proposal, explaining that the current Wartime Council is a central agency for studying military, political, economic, and improving national well-being under wartime conditions. The members of the Council are mainly composed of cabinet ministers and military chiefs, and their activities will be suspended after the end of the war.</p>
<h3>### Indian Independence Struggle; Preparatory Stage Completed; Bose Delivers Speech in Shonan</h3>
<p>Shonan, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Chairman Jiang Tela Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India delivered a speech at a mass rally of Indian people held in front of the Shonan City Government Square at 6:00 p.m. yesterday, saying: Some of our troops have now advanced to the Indian-Myanmar border, and more troops will soon advance to the border. The preparatory stage of the Indian independence struggle has now been fully achieved, and the necessary conditions for victory have been met. Soon, eastern India can liberate Indians, who can then enter and leave at will. After the establishment of the Indian Provisional Government, the political and economic prerequisites for the Indian independence struggle have matured, and most of the British-Indian army also supports this free struggle. In short, the final struggle has begun both inside and outside India, and preparations have been made to make this struggle victorious. In addition, the Greater East Asia Conference Declaration has laid the foundation for opening up East Asia and building a new order, and it was decided at the conference to provide full assistance to India when it launches an independence struggle in the future. The Japanese government has also stated that it intends to transfer the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to the Provisional Government of Free India. I have expressed my greatest gratitude for this, and at the same time, I hope that all Indians in East Asia will unite and continue to fight Japan and its allies to achieve final victory.</p>

<h3>### Italian Republic; Presents New Appearance; Drafting Men Enlist</h3>
<p>Rome, 3rd (Central News Agency) - After the Badoglio regime surrendered, the Italian people fell into great chaos. After a period of hard work, the Fascist New Party was reorganized, preparing to hold a constitutional assembly, adopting social policies, and moving the main organs to northern Italy, all of which showed the new appearance of Italy. Head of State Mussolini has been planning the revival of Italy day and night. Since the Minister of National Defense Graziani, Chief of Staff General Cambara, and Vice Minister of the Air Force Colonel Porter and others have taken office, they have made great efforts to reorganize the disintegrated Italian army. When Graziani took office, he ordered all generals and soldiers in the country to report to their original headquarters as soon as possible. At the same time, he drafted men born in 1924 and 1925. These men have started reporting on November 22. According to Chief of Staff General Gambara, 300,000 new recruits can be obtained from this draft. In addition, the son of former Naval Minister Curtin, who joined the anti-Axis camp at the same time as Badoglio, was only eighteen years old. The day after the armistice, he led his classmates into the militia led by General Lee as volunteers. He is currently receiving officer education.</p>
<h3>### Japanese People; Strive to Save; Total Exceeds 100 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese people continue to fight with an indomitable spirit. Even in terms of savings, they have achieved amazing results. The savings target for this year is 37 billion yen, which is expected to be exceeded. Since December, the promotion of the national savings movement in Japan has become more active. It is expected that after this year's target is achieved, the total amount of savings of the Japanese people in the seven years since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident will exceed 100 billion yen. The Japanese people's enthusiastic savings can compensate for the Japanese government's huge war expenditures in the past seven years, and the Japanese national finances can rely on it to be as stable as a rock. This 100 billion yen of savings, divided among the 100 million Japanese people, is about 1,000 yen per person. The efforts of the Japanese people can be seen here.</p>

<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a Hedy report: German Minister of Propaganda Goebbels wrote in the latest issue of "National Weekly" that perseverance is the most important element in war, because bravery and prudence alone are not enough to achieve the final goal. A nation that fights for survival must have perseverance. Because the victory is often the reward for hardship and labor. The article is titled "Lessons of War." Goebbels continued to tell his readers that when a country is not in danger, its people can live and work in peace. A country that entrusts its national security to foreign countries will perish. Those who are injured in war can boast of their "honor" to their peers.

<h3>Japanese Troops Fighting in Changde Inflict Heavy Blow on Chongqing; Dispatch Army Announces One Week of War Situation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Chongqing army in Changde County, an important stronghold of the 6th War Zone, has been putting up a stubborn resistance for eight days since the elite Japanese troops entered the city. By the 3rd, due to the fierce attacks from the Japanese army and air force, their resistance seemed to have subsided. The Chongqing army's stubborn resistance for eight days is rare. The reasons for their stubborn resistance are as follows: The Chongqing military authorities mistakenly judged that the Japanese army's operation this time was only a deterrent operation, and never expected the Japanese army to attack the heart of the 6th War Zone. In the first phase of the operation, the Chongqing 73rd and 79th armies were defeated by the Japanese army. In the second phase of the operation, the Japanese army isolated the Chongqing 57th and 63rd divisions near Changde County and eventually wiped them out. The Chongqing army mistakenly judged that the Japanese army was fighting in the South Pacific and that battles were taking place in the Indian Ocean, and that there was no spare capacity to launch such a large-scale operation on the mainland front. Furthermore, the strength of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing was overestimated, and they were encouraged by the督战 of the British and American military leaders, hence this action. This operation has made the British, American, and Chongqing sides fully understand that no matter how fierce the South Pacific battle situation is, it will not affect the Japanese army's operations on the mainland. The Battle of Changde is a major blow to Chongqing's future resistance.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Dispatch Army in China announced the war situation for one week on the 3rd as follows: The Japanese army attacking the western area of Dongting Lake has been advancing for two periods, and has defeated approximately 100,000 troops of the Chongqing Central Direct Line Army. A fierce attack was launched on Changde, an important stronghold held by the Chongqing army, and the Chongqing army is currently being cleared out within the city of Changde. Another strong Japanese unit besieged the Longyang area in an attempt to rescue Changde, but the two armies commanded by Zhang Hanming and Fang Xianjue, who attacked the Japanese army's flanks, launched an encirclement and annihilation battle everywhere on the 2nd, completely crushing their attempt. Furthermore, the Japanese army in the South China area has been carrying out a clean-up operation in the Fenjia Delta area since the 26th, defeating approximately 1,000 Chongqing guerrilla troops, achieving great results and achieving the intended goals. Furthermore, the Japanese aircraft cooperated with the ground troops and launched a surprise attack on Suichuan and Nanxiong on the 2nd, bombing Chongqing military facilities and runways at various airfields, and engaged in combat with more than a dozen P/40 and P/51 aircraft of the沦机, shooting down seven of them (four of which have not been confirmed). One B/25 aircraft on the ground was destroyed by bombing, and one Japanese aircraft self-destructed. Furthermore, on the 1st of this month, the Japanese Air Force intercepted more than a dozen B/25 and P/40 aircraft of the US and Chongqing air forces that attacked the Hong Kong area, and confirmed the downing of seven B/40 aircraft.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Raids Suichuan and Nanxiong Airfields</p>
<p>Jiujiang, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, the Japanese Air Force stationed in China used a combined formation of bombers and fighters to bomb the Suichuan Airfield in Jiangxi Province and the Yuxiong Airfield in Guangdong Province, achieving great results. It is reported that on the afternoon of the 2nd, the Japanese Air Force used a combined formation of bombers and fighters to bomb Suichuan, engaging with dozens of enemy aircraft. As a result, a total of seven (P40) and (P51) aircraft were shot down, three of which have been confirmed and four of which have not been confirmed. Another two were seriously damaged and escaped. After defeating the enemy aircraft group, the Japanese bombers dropped a large number of bombs, causing great damage to the airfield's runway and important facilities, and also destroyed one small aircraft parked at the airfield. The Japanese side lost one self-destructed aircraft. At the same time, another Japanese air force team, still using a combined formation of fighter bombers, bombed the Nanxiong Airfield in Guangdong. Only a few ground fire responded, and the Japanese aircraft were able to drop bombs calmly, destroying the runway and one (B25) aircraft.</p>
<h3>German Troops Brave Wind and Snow; Defensive Battles Proceed Smoothly; Soviet Offensive on Northern Wing Thwarted</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: The weather on the Eastern Front continues to be harsh, with alternating rain and snow, making the roads muddy and difficult to travel, greatly hindering troop movements. However, on Wednesday, the German troops on the Southern and Central routes continued to launch fierce counterattacks. The German troops operating west of Smolensk achieved remarkable defensive victories against 28 Soviet infantry divisions and over 200 tanks. The German offensive in the Nevel River bend continues to make progress. The German Air Force's continuous bombing of Soviet artillery positions has greatly contributed to the German victory. There were only local military activities on the Crimean Peninsula and the Nikopol bridgehead.</p>
<p>Dnieper River Frontline Soviet Troops Greatly Reinforced</p>
<p>At the same time, the intensity of the Soviet offensive in the Great Dnieper River bend has decreased. The battles south and southwest of Kremenchu are becoming more active. The Soviet army has transferred strong reinforcements to the area, forcing the German army to retreat. However, all the temporary breakthroughs made by the enemy have been leveled by the German army's fierce attacks, and the main front lines remain firmly in the hands of the German army. The German counteroffensive launched on Tuesday in Cherkasy continues to make progress. A German group that had been surrounded in the area for several days has now been relieved and immediately joined the German counteroffensive. The Soviet army has been driven out of several strongly defended positions, and the battles in the area are still ongoing. There were no significant battles between Zhytomyr and Rzhyshchiv.</p>
<h3>Over One Month Since Establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India</h3>
<p>The Provisional Government of Free India, led by Chandra Bose, has been established for more than a month since October 21st and is gradually entering the stage of combat with the goal of attacking Delhi. Reviewing the government's progress over the past month, its establishment in the international arena and the strengthening of the government and the Indian military and civilians themselves are quite noteworthy. Three days after the government's establishment, it was recognized by Japan and resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States. China, Manchuria, Germany, Italy, Burma, the Philippines, Croatia, Thailand, etc. also successively recognized it, and a total of nine countries have formed friendly relations. Leader Bose personally visited Tokyo, attended the Greater East Asia Conference, and swore together with representatives from various countries to implement the historical Greater East Asia Declaration. On the way home, he visited China and was treated as a state guest. He witnessed the reality of the new China and learned about the spirit and implementation of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, which stipulated Sino-Japanese friendship based on morality, further consolidating Leader Bose's determination for complete Indian independence and contributing to the establishment of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, there was also a lot of help in establishing the international status.</p>
<p>Regarding the government itself, after days of cabinet meetings, a simple and effective government structure, the daily advancement of combat operations, the creation of a capital to be stationed within India, and in order to ensure that the military and civilians of the National Army have no worries, a cabinet committee was established to establish a merit system and a support system for the families of the deceased.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm of the Indian People</p>
<p>After Prime Minister Tojo's previous statement to return the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the government's substantive power increased due to the acquisition of territory, further boosting the enthusiasm of Indians to support the government. The combination of human and material resources is gradually achieving practical results. As a result, the morale of the Indian people has suddenly become strong, posing a great threat to the enemy. According to New Delhi Radio, the strength of the National Army has recently become impossible to ignore, and they say that "the National Army is a puppet army forcibly formed." On the other hand, the British Indian Army does not trust Indian soldiers, and the Indian frontline troops are made to hand over to the Chinese troops stationed in India to cut off the intelligence work of the Indian army. This move is tantamount to admitting the increase in the National Army's courageous combat missions.</p>
<p>Indians who volunteered to join the National Army have been undergoing intense combat training every day, constantly shouting to attack Delhi. After Leader Bose returned from Japan and the various allied countries of East Asia with assurances of cooperation and support, this trend spread like wildfire, reducing the strength of Britain and the United States. The power of the Provisional Government of Free India, which aims to achieve complete Indian independence, is expected to develop further in the future.

<h3>Japanese Military Achievements in the South Pacific Set New Historical Records; One of the Most Brilliant Pages in World War History</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The allied Japanese forces in the South Pacific have recently reported frequent victories. The people of our country are delighted and admire them, and are paying more attention to the continuation of the war situation in that area. Looking back at the great achievements made by the Japanese army in the past month, it is truly one of the most brilliant pages in world war history. From the naval battle off Mono Island on October 27th to the Fourth Air Battle off the Gilbert Islands on November 29th, the enemy's US warships damaged include: four battleships sunk, three large aircraft carriers, eight medium-sized aircraft carriers, nine large cruisers, twenty destroyers, two ships of unknown type, etc., two large aircraft carriers, three medium-sized aircraft carriers, five large cruisers, one cruiser, three medium-sized transport ships, two small transport ships, and many other boats. If the cost of building the ships is calculated, it is actually more than 10 billion US dollars, and the loss of personnel is also more than 20,000.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the United States had a total of 15 battleships, 5 aircraft carriers, 35 Class A and B cruisers, and 223 destroyers. In this one month, the United States has lost 40% of its battleships. Not only have all the aircraft carriers been completely lost, but also the ten newly built ones have been sunk. These figures exceed the total naval power lost by Germany and the Allied powers in the last World War and can be considered a new record for history. Before the outbreak of the war, the United States actively planned shipbuilding three times, including the "Vinson Act" and the "Stark Act," planning to complete 22 battleships, 18 aircraft carriers, 88 cruisers, 374 destroyers, and 194 submarines by the end of 1946. In order to complete this plan, the United States made great efforts to expand shipyards, train skilled workers, and collect materials. But last year, it adopted a completely авиационоцентрический approach, converting battleships, cruisers, merchant ships, etc. into aircraft carriers, so its shipbuilding plan has undergone some changes. Now estimating its total strength, it has 30 battleships, 20 to 25 aircraft carriers, 10 to 15 auxiliary aircraft carriers, 89 cruisers, 374 destroyers, and 193 submarines.</p>
<p>Assuming that the US shipbuilding plan is scheduled to be completed in 1946 and can be fully completed by the end of this year, if the US warships sunk by the Japanese army since the Pearl Harbor attack are counted, including 17 battleships, 27 aircraft carriers, 82 cruisers, 84 destroyers, and 128 submarines, and deducted from its total number, then the US Navy will only have 13 battleships, about 10 aircraft carriers including inferior auxiliary aircraft carriers, 7 cruisers, 290 destroyers, and 65 submarines left. Even if the number of its warships is greater than what people estimate, the fact is that the United States still needs to use a large number of auxiliary ships to transport and aid British and Soviet supplies and must be fixedly deployed in the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, the strength of the Pacific Joint Fleet currently commanded by Admiral Nimitz must be far less than before the war. Moreover, almost every ship has been fiercely attacked by the Japanese navy and air force and is covered with wounds. Therefore, in fact, the fleet he commands is too dilapidated to withstand a single blow.</p>
<p>In order to attempt to dominate the world, Roosevelt did not hesitate to bet the entire country on a single throw. But his choice of the loyal and brave Japanese soldiers as his opponents can be said to be his greatest misfortune. The reason why the US War Department does not hesitate to make such a great sacrifice in an attempt to break through a corner of the Pacific Ocean in order to approach the Japanese mainland is because it realizes that the production number of the US domestic military industry has reached its highest limit. No matter how much effort it makes to mobilize resources and labor, it will not be able to increase it any further. On the other hand, in the past two years, Japan has been actively developing southern resources and striving to increase production at a high speed, so its production capacity is now comparable to that of the United States. By 194趨勢, therefore, if the war is prolonged, the United States will inevitably fall into a situation from which it cannot extricate itself, and the facts are extremely obvious.</p>
<h3>Germany Prepares to Use Rockets to Bomb Britain Across the Channel; Berlin Suffers Another Terrible Air Raid</h3>

<h3>Japanese Army Spokesman Discusses Cairo Conference; A Public Communiqué Like an Idiot's Dream</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News - The spokesman of the Japanese Army Propaganda Department, when receiving reporters yesterday (3rd), spoke about the intentions of the Chiang Kai-shek Cairo talks.</p>
<p>The Failure of the Talks is Fully Exposed</p>
<p>Briefly stated: After Chiang Kai-shek and his wife participated in the so-called Cairo Conference, they returned to Chongqing on December 1st with more than a dozen attendants. The propaganda freedom of the Chongqing side seems to have been completely deprived by Britain and the United States. The propaganda of Chiang Kai-shek after returning to Chongqing is not worth listening to. From the communiqué issued after the closing of the Cairo Conference, compared with the East Asia Joint Declaration of our side, which is based on righteousness, it is truly known as an idiot's dream, and there is a great difference. The failure of the Cairo Conference is fully exposed by this. Originally, the Cairo Conference came from the strategy of Britain and the United States. At the beginning, there was enthusiastic propaganda, saying that Stalin would also participate, but the result ended in failure. Because the continuous disastrous defeats of Britain and the United States in the Pacific Ocean had a great impact on the anti-Axis people, how to save it, especially the independence of Burma and the Philippines, the establishment of the Provisional Government of India, the Sino-Japanese Alliance, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and other news, which were successively spread, their embarrassed and difficult situation is truly undeniable. At this time, how to prevent the Chongqing side from leaving the camp is the main purpose of this meeting. From this, it can also be seen that Britain and the United States are anxious and uneasy about the Greater East Asia War. The communiqué of the conference will inevitably become the甘饵 of irresponsible shackles on the Chongqing side, but I am afraid it will be difficult for people of reason on the Chongqing side to believe it.</p>
<p>No Progress on Any Battlefield</p>
<p>Their anxiously awaited counter-offensive operation against Japan has been slow to make progress on any battlefield. The counter-offensive in Burma is only propaganda. Apart from sacrificing the Chongqing army on the Yunnan border, there has been no development. Britain claims that preparations have not been completed, which is ridiculous. The offensive in the Pacific has also entered the Japanese army's designated area, and the damage to the US army is not the same as in the past. Moreover, the US troops landing on Tarawa Island and Makin Island in the Gilbert Islands have become the target of the Japanese army's attrition warfare. In the future, in order to maintain its face, the United States will inevitably seek to replenish urgently, but this is exactly what the Japanese army hopes for. How long can the United States endure is truly a question. As for the battlefield in China, the occupation of Changde, the stronghold of the 6th War Zone Army, is only a matter of time. At present, the remnants of the defeated Chongqing army are being cleared out of the city. The counter-offensive of the Chongqing army seems to be quite stubborn. This is because Changde City has been occupied by the Japanese army, and the retreat of the Chongqing army has been completely cut off, so it is bound to be stubbornly resisted. As a result, the achievements of the Japanese army are increasing day by day. Although the US Air Force occasionally dispatches to assist the Chongqing army in combat, due to their unfamiliarity with the geography, they often mistakenly bomb the Chongqing army. Furthermore, some troops from the 9th and 7th War Zones have also come to support, and they are currently being defeated one by one. In short, Changde is the first area attacked by the Japanese army and the key to entering Chongqing. Its fate is strategically important, and its impact on both the spiritual and material sides is also extremely significant.</p>
<h3>Minister Hirota's Review: The Current Stage of the War - The Axis' Short-Term War Plan is Hopeless</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: Mr. Hirota, the Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, gave a speech yesterday (the 3rd) at 3 PM at the joint press conference held by the Army and Navy in Shanghai, commemorating the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. He reviewed the achievements of the past two years, examined the current state of the war, and discussed future prospects. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Wartime Experience</p>
<p>Mr. Hirota began by stating, "The 8th of this month marks the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. We plan to hold grand celebrations on that day. Looking back on our achievements over the past two years, and in light of the current stage of the war and future prospects, I would like to make a simple review. The Greater East Asia War has already lasted two years. This period is relatively short; the Sino-Japanese War had already lasted four and a half years before the Greater East Asia War. Germany has also been fighting in Europe for two wars. Therefore, both Japan and Germany have considerable wartime experience. Japan has been at war for six and a half years, and Germany for over four years. Thus, our Axis powers have already engaged in large-scale operations in the ongoing world war. The progress made in these two years is only a small part of a long-term war. Conversely, the politicians of the opposing anti-Axis powers have been telling their people that the current war will be a long-term one. This contradicts their previous statements about a short-term war. The anti-Axis powers believed that the areas occupied by Japan were rich in resources. If Japan were to develop and utilize these resources, its strength would increase, and it would be difficult for Britain and the United States to defeat Japan. Therefore, they tried to deny Japan any time to develop these resources. According to the British and American politicians, these statements are full of contradictions that anyone can see.</p>
<p>Contradictory Theories</p>
<p>Mr. Hirota continued to analyze the contradictions of enemy politicians, saying that the anti-Axis powers' attempt to deny Japan time meant they were admitting they would be defeated by Japan. This is a fact. Therefore, the theory of launching a long-term war is contradictory. Looking back at the recent military strength of Britain and the United States, especially their air raids in the South Pacific, it is evident that they do not want a long-term war and hope to end it quickly. Their true intention was to prevent Japan from developing the resources of the South Pacific and gaining sufficient strength. However, this plan of Britain and the United States has completely failed. Britain and the United States were defeated at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. The resources of the South Pacific are now occupied by Japan. The attempt to counterattack in the South Pacific has also been defeated. Therefore, estimating the results of the Pacific operations in the two years since the Greater East Asia War began, the enemy has suffered heavy losses, with 17 battleships and 28 aircraft carriers sunk. The number of other ships damaged is more than double the above figures. On our side, the losses have been small. In the past two years, only one battleship and two aircraft carriers have been sunk.</p>
<p>Ratio of War Results</p>
<p>According to our recent war records, the ratio of war results is such that for every battleship or aircraft carrier of Britain or the United States sunk, we only need to destroy three or four enemy aircraft. Therefore, despite such significant sacrifices by the enemy, they continue to exaggerate their propaganda, wanting to recapture the South Seas, the Pacific, the Gilbert Islands, the Ellice Islands, and Tarawa Island, and trying to secure the islands of Makin and Apamama. These two islands are extremely small, only two and a half kilometers long and half a kilometer wide, yet they are concentrating their attacks on them. However, so far, they are only conducting air raids and have not launched any active attacks. They continue to exaggerate their propaganda, claiming to be seizing one island after another, in order to attack the Japanese mainland. Judging from the situation in the past, even if they were able to achieve their goals, it would require an extremely great loss and take tens of times more damage and time. The number of battleships and aircraft carriers that the United States has lost so far is roughly equal to the number they had built before the Greater East Asia War. If they want to expand their naval fleet further, it will take a considerable amount of time. According to experts in battleship construction, it takes three years to build a battleship and one and a half years to build an aircraft carrier. Therefore, the time it will take for them to build the fleet they need to attack Japan is unknown, and this task will be even more difficult to complete.</p>
<p>Japan has the Advantage</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that their long-term war is even more difficult to realize, while the strength of the Japanese army can be realized. The longer the war lasts, the faster the strength of the Japanese army will recover. It is becoming increasingly clear that the Greater East Asia War is advantageous to Japan. Therefore, this is a truly favorable condition for Japan. At the same time, the situation in the European theater can be said to be the same. The anti-Axis powers are extremely eager to end the war quickly, and there are many reasons why they do not want a long-term war. However, Germany has already completed its long-term war plan, so the anti-Axis powers' attempts to end the war with Germany quickly have also failed. Germany has adopted the shortest front line on the Eastern Front, making it easier to defend and difficult for the enemy to attack, which is geographically advantageous. To ensure security, the entire front line has been fortified. The anti-Axis British and American forces attacking Italy have made no special progress in the three months since they launched their offensive against the Italian mainland in early September of this year, so there has been no special development. From Germany's perspective, the number of anti-Axis troops attacking is quite small, only a few divisions. Moreover, special attention is being paid to the Dodecanese Islands and the islands in the Aegean Sea between Greece and Turkey, such as Rhodes and Samos. All of these major islands have been occupied by German forces. With this occupation, the British and American forces have been unable to occupy major areas such as Greece, and they can no longer pass through the Dardanelles Strait to reach the Black Sea. Therefore, in the Eastern European theater, the Italian front, and the Balkan front, the anti-Axis powers have achieved no special results. The anti-Axis powers' exaggerated and reckless claims of resolving the German issue within a few years have also been dashed. Therefore, looking at both the Greater East Asia War and the European War, the anti-Axis powers' short-term war plans are completely hopeless, while the Axis powers' victory in a long-term war is gradually being realized and completed. As we approach the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, we are presenting these reasons, which are only a very small part of what has been achieved in the long-term war over the past two years."</p>

<p>Economic Review</p>
<h3>The Center of Industry</h3>
<p>As the authorities order all large and small factories in this city to increase industrial production, we wish to address the issue of "The Center of Industry" as a subject for research on the problem of increasing production. Originally, the world's large industries are the result of increased pressure, but China's industry is still in its infancy, and there is basically no large industry to speak of. Therefore, those who are increasing industrial production today can only focus on light industry and home handicrafts, and cannot talk about large or heavy industry. This is a regrettable aspect of the wartime industrial production increase movement, and we must admit it.</p>
<p>We note that a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 2nd stated that Manchuria's heavy industry has been making rapid progress recently. The amount of steel produced, the massive power generation capacity of power plants, and the entry of the artificial soybean oil industry into the era of formal enterprises are all admirable. We consider it something to be hoped for but unattainable, and Manchuria's heavy industry is leaping forward, while its machinery and chemical industries are also developing at an alarming rate, and is rapidly advancing from the raw materials industry to the finished products industry. Looking back at China, we still feel far behind, and we cannot help but sigh!</p>
<p>According to Marx's theory, the world's large industries rely on production, and production relies on capitalists. This is indeed true. However, China's largest industry in the past was the Hanyeping Company. It had good copper and iron production and ample capital, but it still failed. This shows that the center of industry is not only in the factories that produce goods, but also in the consuming society. Therefore, the world's large industries in modern times manufacture goods according to the needs of consumers. Therefore, we feel that the key to strengthening the base of production lies in strengthening the consuming society, that is, solving the problem of people's livelihoods. Otherwise, expanding production is unrealistic. In short, the center of industry relies on the consuming society.</p>
<h3>Special Deposits Exempt from Reserve Requirements, Financial Inspection Office Specifies Eight Types</h3>
<p>Since the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank began handling the business of inspecting financial institutions, progress has been exceptionally smooth. All financial institutions (including banks, native banks, and trust companies), in addition to submitting monthly statements to the office for inspection on schedule, have also deposited reserve funds for fixed-term, current, and special current deposits in accordance with the regulations of the Provisional Measures for Managing Financial Institutions and the Detailed Implementing Rules. The office then determines the deposit reserve fund to be paid based on the deposit amount listed in the monthly statements submitted by the financial institutions, and notifies them to deposit it with the Central Reserve Bank. If the total amount of deposits of each financial institution increases or decreases monthly, the reserve funds can be withdrawn and paid at any time. It is learned that the nature of the special deposit items are regulated. The following types of deposits are exempted from reserve requirements if it is determined that they are truly to be paid out within a short period of time after verification: Deposits from fellow financial institutions, internal transfers, temporary deposits and miscellaneous deposits, entrustments from fellow financial institutions, unmatured bills, savings for war personnel, frozen foreign currency deposits, and other funds collected as an agent.</p>
<h3>Central China Rawhide Company to Collect Cowhides</h3>

Although the purchase of cowhides has not been decided due to price issues, it will be implemented soon. The purchase area will especially focus on Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. However, the market price of cowhides is different from the past, so the purchase price needs to be carefully considered.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rise in Chinese stocks intensified, with market prices soaring all day. The entire day was dominated by buying, and only slightly cooled off in the last half hour before the close, due to some short-term retail investors taking profits.

<h3>Written Before the Implementation of Coal Ball Rationing</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>According to reports, the Bureau is actively planning to implement coal ball rationing as early as possible. This is undoubtedly good news for us petty citizens of the working class. However, considering that the rationing of several essential goods in the past did not meet our expectations, with regard to the upcoming coal ball rationing! We hope that the authorities can plan comprehensively and especially hope that the following points can be achieved within the possible scope.</p>
<p>Quantity Since coal balls lack substitutes, and the rice, vegetables, water, and all hot food items of Shanghai residents are mostly prepared using coal ball stoves, the rationing quantity must meet the minimum needs of the general public. According to the author's investigation, the average household with approximately ten people consumes about forty to fifty "dan" of coal per month. In other words, each person needs about forty to fifty "jin" per month. Therefore, if the amount rationed by the authorities is too different from this, the citizens will inevitably find ways to obtain it from other sources. In this way, it may be difficult to suppress the demand in the black market. Furthermore, even if it can be suppressed, how will the fuel problem for millions of citizens be solved? Conversely, panic will naturally be eliminated, and the black market will have no reason to exist. To achieve this, it is hoped that the Bureau will actively ensure the smooth flow of raw material sources and restrict unnecessary consumption.</p>
<p>Quality In addition to coal dust, yellow mud and other ingredients are mixed into the production of coal balls, and there is a fixed ratio for this. However, recently, due to the coal ball panic, some manufacturers have resorted to their old trick of taking advantage of the situation to make a profit by cutting corners. The originally black coal balls have now turned gray, and they are not durable and consume a lot of fuel when burning. Users suffer greatly from this. After the implementation of rationing, it is hoped that the authorities will set certain standards for the composition of coal balls and send personnel to various manufacturers to investigate at any time. If any manufacturers are found to be cutting corners, they should be severely punished to prevent others from following suit.</p>
<p>Price Of course, it is hoped that the selling price can best maintain the previous price limit, but if it is indeed necessary to increase it slightly due to cost factors, it is also acceptable. I believe that the public will definitely not oppose a reasonable price increase. However, frequent changes and price increases are most undesirable, because the price increase of rationed goods is most likely to stimulate the rise of general prices. This is proven by the past, and it can be known that this statement is not false.</p>
<p>Collection Points Coal balls are not as convenient as rice, flour, sugar, soap, etc. Each quantity is in the tens or hundreds of "jin," and they are unusually bulky, making collection very inconvenient. Therefore, the collection points should be as close as possible to the residences of the collectors to facilitate convenience. Do not make the distance too far, like with sugar, which only increases the troubles of the people.</p>
<p>In addition, it is hoped that the determination of the number of rationing times per month, the management of distribution points, etc., will be strictly and reasonably formulated to ensure that the coal ball rationing this time is ideally successful. At the same time, it is hoped that the management of other rationed items can also be gradually improved so that the lives of us common people can be stabilized, which would be fortunate indeed.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Grandeur of Liu Haisu's Art Exhibition, with a Gift of Thirty Rhymes by the Famous Painter Wang Xian</h3>
<p>Mr. Liu Haisu's calligraphy and painting exhibition has been held at the China Book Garden on Chengdu Road since the 30th of last month. Since the opening of the exhibition, it has been a grand occasion. The Chinese paintings "Wind, Urgency, and Rain in the Country," "Group of Cattle in the Country," "Emerald Autumn Landscape," "A Pair of Piebald Horses," and "Fisherman's Circle," and the oil paintings "Coconut Grove by the Sea," "Warm," "Cockfight," and other recent works by Bai Ma are particularly eye-catching to the audience. Collectors from home and abroad have come to the exhibition to order works, and more than thirty works have already been ordered. It is heard that there is still one week left in the exhibition period, and those who admire Mr. Liu's art and fellow artists all want to see it as soon as possible. In recent days, the literary and art circles have sent letters to Mr. Liu to express their congratulations and admiration. The famous painter Mr. Wang Xian has specially composed a long poem of thirty rhymes to present to Mr. Liu, criticizing Mr. Liu's art and personality, which can be passed down forever. A special excerpt is as follows:</p>
<p>Haisu creates paintings with natural sounds, his heart is magnificent and filled with strange wonders. He treads the path of calligraphy and painting, encompassing the essence, uniquely creating a realm beyond the ordinary. It is difficult to categorize him into a specific school, his casualness lightly overcomes difficulties. He draws on the inspiration of Gauguin and Matisse, combining Shi Tao and Bada, forging them into one furnace, with a spirit of ancientness, novelty, and universality. His spirit is entrusted to something that will never decay, a small mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru, a form unrestrained and unfettered. Living in a remote corner is also carefree, drawing essence in the night, like riding a horse flying with a long lance. He befriends the ancients, indulging in wild gestures, destruction and praise are left to others without hindrance, what regret is there in returning after tribulations? He regards everything outside the paper as worn-out shoes. Today, there are thousands of calligraphers and painters, how many can truly understand? When discussing painting with me, he seeks the ultimate, the governor of Yunnan is enlightened and praises him (the realm of learning is boundless, success is always just a little bit short, I am lazy and my heart is not lax, I smile at you and relieve my narrowness. Do not let the sun and moon press upon your eyes, the book is completed suddenly, cultivating the wind and the wind, do not boast together in one word, go against the current and never retreat.</p>

<h3>Soliciting Donations for Making Winter Clothes, an Opportunity for Those Aspiring to Help the Poor</h3>
<p>The cold winter with its piercing north wind is approaching in the blink of an eye. The homeless people on the streets and lanes, and the hidden poor who lack winter clothes, will undoubtedly freeze to death. In the past, when prices were low, it was easy to purchase clothes everywhere. Those with slightly better living conditions, seeing the misery, would feel compassion and donate clothes. This year, cotton cloth and cotton are under control. There is a shortage of clothing makers, and it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain clothes temporarily. Even if there are manufacturers and retailers, the cost is high, at least two hundred and sixty or seventy yuan per garment. Recognizing this, the Shanghai News has partnered with the Shanghai Buddhist Charity Kitchen to apply to the Commercial Control Association for the allocation of raw materials. The cost per garment is about one hundred and sixty yuan, and the size and amount of cotton are detailed in the newspaper's report on the 28th of last month. It is estimated that there are still 1,800 garments without sponsors. Therefore, this announcement is made to solicit donations from all sectors of society. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>The cost of making each garment is one hundred and sixty yuan, payable in full in advance. (Collection point: Shanghai News Social Services Department) The number of garments donated ranges from one to one hundred for individuals, and the number for organizations will be discussed separately. The total number is limited to 1,800 garments. However, donors must not profit from the resale of the garments. Even if they are transferred, the price must not exceed the original price of one hundred and sixty yuan. The date for collecting the garments will be announced in this column after the cotton clothes are made. Cotton clothes can be exchanged for the receipt at this newspaper.</p>
<h3>Foguang Sanatorium Establishes Free Outpatient Department</h3>
<p>Foguang Sanatorium, located at 123 Masnan Road in this city, is sparing no effort in its work to relieve the poor and sick. In addition to establishing an outpatient department for diagnosis and medication, the院长 of the sanatorium, Doctor Ma Jianwo, has recently, in view of the rising cost of living for citizens, especially the poor, established a free outpatient department to provide free services. Residents of the Eighth District who are indeed poor and sick can register at the hospital's registration office every morning. The hospital will assign a specialist doctor to provide treatment without charging a consultation fee, which is truly an innovative initiative.</p>
<h3>Loan Soap Vending Method with Soap Factory</h3>
<p>Any small vendors without operating capital need only provide a store guarantee of five hundred to one thousand yuan, or a proof letter from the Social Service Department of the Shen Bao, and they can apply to the factory for credit to sell goods. After the factory accepts the guarantee or guarantee, it will lend soap to them at the lowest price for them to set up a stall or sell by hand. However, every night, the proceeds from the sales must be returned to the factory according to the principal, and then the sold-out goods will be replenished for sale the next day. Those who are responsible for the loan, if the soap sales are particularly good every month, in addition to making a profit, the factory can also give a monthly allowance of 200 yuan. If it is not possible to obtain a guarantor, it is also possible to submit a considerable amount of credit or cash guarantee. As long as the goods are paid, the guarantee or cash can be returned at any time. This method can be contacted at Sanxing Soap Factory, No. 17 Xinshi Market, 954 Muming Road, Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<h3>Old Newspapers Can Be Made into Coal Ball Substitutes</h3>
<p>Accidentally, in an old magazine, I found an "Old Newspaper Utilization Method." I thought that the prices must have been low at that time and it must not have been taken seriously; but at this time of high prices due to the lack of coal balls, we need it very much. Now I will extract it and introduce it to you, readers, you can imitate it in large quantities: "First soak the old newspaper in water to make it thoroughly wet, and then shape it into balls to light the fire. The firepower is very strong and can be used for cooking. If you accumulate a month's worth of newspapers, it will not be difficult to use them for a week's worth of cooking. If you put in a little more effort, mix in the enemy's dry soil and knead it into charcoal, then it will have the same uses as coal." (Yu Jing)</p>
<h3>Job Placement Center Seeks Talent</h3>
<p>Now, a certain organization wants to hire several document drafters. The writing must be clear and neat, and the gender is not limited. The salary is generous. A certain machinery factory wants to hire an assistant engineer who must have a degree in advanced mechanical science and factory experience. The salary is negotiable. A certain elementary school wants to hire a class teacher who can sing. The monthly salary is four to five hundred yuan. A certain farmer education place needs several specialized talents with agricultural and animal husbandry experience. A certain women's supplementary school wants to hire a female teacher of English mathematics, with a monthly salary of three to four hundred yuan. A certain bank recruits several trainees with a junior high school education, aged sixteen to twenty years old. The contact point is the Vocational Introduction Office of the Social Welfare Lu, No. 200 Neimi Road, or the Vocational Guidance Office in the Chamber of Commerce of Tianhou Temple Bridge.</p>
<h3>Lament of a Poor Scholar</h3>
<p>I regret studying too hard in those years, the solitary lamp accompanied me through long nights. If I had known that the court valued talent lightly, why would I have focused so much on strategy in the window of the study? I am left with deep sorrow filling my chest, ashamed of not contributing to the community. How can I bear to see the late yellow flowers, the wind is strong, the sky is high, and the days are getting shorter!</p>
<p>In my youth, I had lofty ambitions looking towards Yunmeng. The years passed by, and I am now plowing with my pen. In the future, I will share the blessings of the window, and I will have no blessings in this life to wait for the Yellow River to clear. I embellish empty words to the extreme, and the roads of the world are bumpy and I strive in vain. I have words of tears before the wine: why were you so eager for fame in those years?

<h3>Letter of Clarification</h3>
<p>I recently read Mr. Yao Fu's public letter, commenting on the meaning of my work "Song" and the "High Song One" in the Wanxiang Tenth Day Journal. According to my humble opinion, my "Song" was created during the summer vacation this year, taking inspiration from "La Marseillaise" and "Man Jiang Hong." Mr. Ye's article was not read at all. I hereby correct this. (Hu Ruoliu)</p>
