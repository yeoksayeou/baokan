<h3 id="c1">兒童節的希望 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自從民國二十年，由中華慈幼協會發起以四月四日爲兒童節，年年此日，各地各界都有盛大的集會紀念。今天已經是第十二屆的兒童節日了，我們覆閣當時慈幼協會發起此事的呈文中：「國家盛衰，視乎民族，民族强弱，視乎兒童，是兒童爲國家未來主人翁，亦即文化轉移之中心點，……使人人有慈幼思想，人人負慈幼責任，並可使兒童自知所處之地位，……以樹强國强種之基。」等語，不無深長的感觸。雖則年年有兒童節，我們年年有點綴的紀念，可是經過了十二　的提倡，事實上究竟做得多少積極的慈幼工作？所以，今天我們不願以慶祝口調，或是闡揚理論做應時文章，而願以檢討的態度，貢獻一些最低限度的意見。</p>
<p>第一，就上海一地而論，流浪街頭，淪爲小乞丐的兒童，到處可見，滿身骯髒，瘡疤累累，微弱的哀求聲，瘦削的乞憐手，誰無兒女，何忍一任流浪，誰說是未來的主人翁，而竟躑躅街頭。對於這一般已經沒有人保護的流浪兒童，養育的責仟，就應該由社會來負担，必要時强制收容，不能再讓他們流浪下去。</p>
<p>第二，還有一般兒童原是有父母，有監護人養育的，因爲貧無立錐之地，實在沒有能力養育，也就是赤貧和隱貧之家的兒童，雖不仟之流浪，可是天天在飢餓中捱生活，更談不到敎育，這種貧苦兒童的數目，一定遠超過於流浪兒童，更應該由社會各界發揮愛護心情來幫同養育。</p>
<p>現在上海專辦慈幼福幼的慈善團體，數目不少，熱心的精神，也足稱道。可是，要澈底做到上面兩棲事，無疑的還需要擴大範圍，最主要的仍盼望社會各界有錢有力者，十分同情這件有積極意義培養民族的重大工作，共同盡力，充實慈幼團體的經費，責成他們担負上述的工作。</p>
<p>以上所說的，是偏於「養」方面，我們以爲這是先決問題。至於「敎」方面，當然同樣是重要問題，方案已多，這裏暫不申論。</p>
<p>我們更盼望明年今日不再見街頭上有流浪兒童，那末，今日的口頭慶祝，收到了實際效果，那時候才値得大大的慶祝。</p>

<h3 id="c2">德國潛水艦戰的展望 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>自三月一日起至十五日的半月間，德國海軍共擊沉敵船五十萬噸。又自其翌日起的四日之間，在北大西洋的襲擊戰中，一舉殲滅英美的護航船團卅二艘，二十萬四千噸，爲通商破壞戰史上空前的紀錄。德國潛水艦隊去年十一月在大西洋，地中海曾擊沉英美的艦船一，〇三五，〇〇〇噸，爲開戰以來的最高紀錄。但這三月份全月所獲的戰果，預料恐不致見遜於上述的數字。德國潛水艦戰的最高權威者卡爾鄧尼資提督自代賴德元帥而就任海軍最高指揮官以來，僅一個月，而已獲得如許戰果，德國海軍陣容的整備，實給予英美以新的恐怖。</p>
<p>開戰以來，在對英作戰上，德國用潛水艦進行通商破壞戰爲其最主要手段，舉全力建造大量潛水艦並養成船員，所以潛水艦戰的戰果累月增進，去年五月以來的擊沈紀錄，平均每月八十萬噸。除正月因天氣不利於潛水艦的活動外，擊沈的數字月有增加。對這德國潛水艦的威脅，英美深感棘手，去年末英國設置對潛水艦戰委員會，以首相邱吉爾爲委員長，並以軍令部長，空軍參謀總長，海相亞歷山大，空相辛克萊爲委員，竭力研究阻遏潛水艦的對策。因而本年正月中擊沈數的减少，邱吉爾欣然誇稱爲對策委員會的成功，甚至於聲言潛水艦戰的危機已成過去。鄧尼資元帥潛水艦新戰術的新　初試，瞬即從根推翻了邱吉爾的樂觀論。英國海軍權威者溫斯德在二月中被害，反軸心方面的船舶，今正瀕於全滅的危機。在前决大戰中，德國潛水艦繞航北海而於大西洋出舉，此次則完全相反，與英本土僅一衣帶水之隔，在比國及法國的南岸，築有强固的基地，確保大西羊地中每出擊的自由，英美所受的威脅，與前次大戰比較起來，更爲重大。</p>
<p>在此情勢下，英美專門家之間所提出的潛水艦對策，如加緊建造潛水艦，把現在的護送方法，即船團十五只對驅逐艦一隻的比率，提高至三只對一只。爲使船舶的速度能與德國潛水艦的水上速率相對抗，把船行的速度提高至廿三海哩以上。這些對策現成爲討論的中心題目。姑暫以此議言之有理，但從英美的造艦計劃及造船技術方法上看來，無法立即付之實施。反之，德國潛水艦的激增狀况，即據每日先驅報的估計，開戰時有七十只，現在已達八倍，何况德國在隱秘的處所，對空襲絕對安全的工廠中，以每日建造一只的速度進行建艦。英美的對策，其實現似無可能，而他面德國的潛水艦則有飛躍的增加，兩相對照，今後的通商破壞戰，將呈現怎樣的狀態呢？適宜於潛水艦活動的春季降臨了。在東部戰綫，我們對德軍的捲土重來，固刮目以待，同時，對鄧尼資所施行的通商破壞戰的前途，亦懷着極大的期望。（翔：譯自三月二十四日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<p>今井——希待勒總統此次的演說，强調未來的春季攻勢，同時，並聲述德軍在此次戰爭中的使命，端在抑制共產主義的伸張，防止其侵入歐洲。那麼，對德·蘇戰的觀測如何？</p>
<p>茂木——德國，英國的看法都以德蘇戰爲決定此次戰爭的關鍵。關於德國在本年是否發動大攻勢，有種種說數。有人以爲德國現致力於鞏固所謂「歐洲要塞」，因此，預料其將採取防禦攻勢，不致於發動似以前那樣大規模的攻勢。但即使其目標眞在確立「歐洲要塞」，也終得發動新的攻勢。現在正在整備中的總動員終了之後，可以得到大量生力軍的參加，所以此次才是最後的對蘇決戰。但此次作戰將極度愼重嚴防英美方面的蹈隙以乘。希特勒總統再度强調德國爲對共產主義唯一的防塞，在央美支配曆看來，是頗爲棘手的一種言論。</p>
<p>今井——是的，以打倒資本主義爲目標的蘇聯，與最高度資本主義國家結成共戰綫，似這樣愚蠢的政治的妥協，在軸心方面是不存在的。</p>
<p>茂木——現在再看德國方面的情形如何？</p>
<p>今井——希特勒總統發表開戰以來德軍戰死的總數爲五十四萬二千人。那樣激烈的戰事，而犧牲如此之少，實堪驚異。德國與蘇聯在本年春同佈背水之陣，三度相見於戰塲。一般對蘇聯坑戰力的評價怎樣呢？</p>
<p>茂木——詳細當然不得而知，大體所傳的數字如次：</p>
<p>食糧方面，去年的收獲，除飼料外，的二千三百萬噸，一年的需要量則爲三千萬噸。然而有相當的貯藏，故食糧在今後二年間似不成問題。石油，巴庫出產二千四百萬噸，由伏爾加河舟運，現在的情形如何，是一疑問。高加索以外的地方出產一千萬噸，貯藏的亦有一千萬噸，而一年間的需要量二千萬噸，似亦可供給、滿足需要。兵器生產能力，月產飛機的一千三百架，戰車的一千二百輛。兵力在歐洲第一綫者的六百萬，遠東的八十萬，此外再加上國境警備隊，總計約有九百萬。所以現在的動員能力的四百萬至五百萬。如此看來，蘇聯　德國同樣在本年裏可布背水之陣。德國在本年的一擊中，不問蘇聯是否屈服，爲與英美直接對　，無論如何對蘇戰　不能不求一結束。故今年的夏季將爲德蘇戰的頂點。</p>
<p>今井——在蘇聯的攻勢繼續的時候，曾促使英美從速開　第一戰綫，但他們終於失去了這良好的機會。從軍事上看來，突尼西亞戰綫如未能　固，則第二戰綫不可能。這形勢迄今依然不變。第八軍雖已開始了總攻擊，據傳在北非英美合計有三十個師團，飛機四十架。而羅美　，阿尼姆兩軸心軍的僅一十師團左右。軸心軍阻止英美的開　第二戰綫，可算已獲成功。但在這二，三個月中，英美極力加緊後方運輸，一部送至突尼西亞戰綫，其他則送至西亞方面。似亟亟於早日結束突尼西亞戰綫而從東地中海方面開始第二戰綫。軸心力面亦不甘落後，及時準備中。（翔：譯自三月二十七日東京朝日新聞）（完）</p>

<p>日期　卅二年三十二日</p>
<p>地點　日華俱樂部</p>
<p>栗本先生：在中國有着「無雲不下雨」的俗諺。商人譬之是雲，物資譬之是雨。現在對於物資交流問題的希望之中，把中國榨取的商人認爲是不必要而要加以排除；只是如果把商人加以排除，物資恐怕是動不來了。這點似乎須得加以考慮，李先生以爲何如？商人的地位，有着確認之必要。這譬如因緣和果三者缺一不可。猶之一粒穀，放在氈毯上面，決不會生出稻來，必須藉着土，水和光之緣，才能有秋天的結實。和這相同，物資的交流，商人實是不能或缺乏重要的構成分子。</p>
<p>李權時先生：那是不錯的，只是，在現在統制時代，貪圖暴利，是不許的；若是以適當的利潤爲滿足，那末商人自　有存在的必要。</p>
<p>姚慶三先生：本人對於緩和物資移動，及全國商業統制會之類的辦法，在大東亞戰爭發生後，不斷加以鼓吹，此次見諸實行，衷心愉快，非言可喻。先言全國商業統制會事，此次日本當局將物資統制權移交中國，自屬賢明之舉，實際上亦確然由中國人自己辦，始能獲得民衆的協力。在此有最重要之一點，即爲諒解精神，而諒解精神的基礎，是在平等公允。將來一切統制辦法，應不分國籍，全面施行。旣不偏袒華商，亦不偏袒日商；更需鐵面無私，才能博得同情。其次，關於緩和物資移動辦法，本人認爲應撤除不必要之統制，政府對於供給來源能够控制，消費方面能施配給的商品，自應加以統制，至其他商品則不如讓其自由買賣，因爲祇有限價而無配給辦法，其結果徒使市塲上的有效供給减少，消費者的需要難求滿足，流幣所及，必致鼓勵囤積，助長黑市，以往的經騐足爲我們今後的指針。</p>
<p>武內先生：物價問題，結果還是作爲經濟問題之最終的結晶爲好。若是把這物價的問題作綜合的檢討，自然也會得明白以後的經濟政策的方向。又其本體之民生問題和今後的經濟運營，也是非常重大的問題。關於這個問題，要請木內先生發表總括的意思。</p>
<p>木內先生：物價問題，實在是一個最難的問題。正如武內先生的意見，是政治現象和經濟現象的綜合。現在物價以非常急劇的步調騰昂，人們都以爲這種上漲，是差不多沒有停止希望的，可是我對於這點，倒並不那麼悲觀。　以故呢？因爲物價上昇的最　原因，是在於物資交流的限制。這次新政策的結果，如能把物資交流的限制解除——這不用說是不能全面的解除，但只消大部分解除，——則物價　責的最大原因便就消弭掉。由着這個意味，這回把從來的移動限制的解除，還要視乎那要組織起來的中國方面的統制自主——一任民間的自主的統制機關的活動成功與否的。在這意味上，這次要組織起來的民間的自主的商業機關，若是成功的話，那末在這個條件之下，物價問題也就大半得以解決了。</p>
<p>再者，關於現在物價的　昂，引起人們很相差異的見解，也有以爲是由於儲備券價値的難於維持的。可舉爲一個例子的，最近物價的騰昂，由於德蘇戰况，北非戰况等軸心方面非常不利的傳聞。關於這點，軸心方面，能得最後的勝利，是絕對可以確信的；那以爲軸心方面不利的見解，分明是個錯誤的認識。便是關於儲備券的發行額，世人們的臆測，較之實際的救字，遠爲鉅大。這點也實是一個極端錯誤的認識，是中着流言蜚語『影大神戲』之毒的。</p>
<p>以上是我關於物價之將來，以爲是不必抱着悲觀的理由。現在再把今後的統制方針，究竟怎麼施行之點，略抒管見。</p>
<p>今後的物價政策，是應當循着怎麼方向進行呢？剛纔姚先生所說過的統制，是只行之於統制者方面所把握的物資，其他大槪容其自由，這是大體的方針。所謂統制者方面所把握的物資，不消說，是從南方輸入的米，上海的棉紗，棉布，以及香烟，火柴等等，可作爲所謂賦予證明物資之用的物資。這些不妨視爲統制者方面所把握的物資。這統制者方面所把握物資的價格，維持於低位，拿來如最初李先生所說，和內地的生產物資交換。依着這個方向，這兩件事，若是能够做得到，那是大體上足以樹立上海經濟之機幹的，至於其他物資，大體是小妨容其自由的。這所謂容其自由，依着現在所認識的說來，雖然像越發使得物價騰漲似的；但是如果認自由就是交流的話，那實際上反而可以期待着使物價維持水準的結果的。這是極爲平凡的見解，又和諸位所常說的見解，沒有兩樣。</p>
<p>武內先生：潘先生，請—</p>
<p>潘仰堯先生：（一）日本對華新政策轉變後，希望日本方面，尊重中國商人在軌道內有自由貿易之便利。凡內地農產品與上海之機製品，相互交易，以達物資交流自由暢通之地步。已往不必要之限制，與極麻煩之手續，希望從此革除，俾商人身受之困難，從此避免。中間人之一切龔斷，侵蝕，漁利等行爲，亦無自而生。苟能如此，則廠商得以安心製造，加緊生產，貿易商人亦得就當地與各省市之需要與供給，酌盈劑虛，懋遷有無，以期物價平衡，市塲安定，此則深願當局切實注意，予以實現，同時希望中日商人各以平等貿易之立塲，致力於彼此業務之平衡發展，則經濟中心之上海，不難改變已往之局勢，而漸人於繁榮道上。</p>
<p>（二）當前物價，最大癥結，在有貨者不肯售貨，而無貨者拼命購貨，工廠以所淮原料成本日高，寗願積儲原料以待善價。即使製造成品，核諸當局限價，有虧無盈，寗願積存成品，以待善價。於是求貨者無法購貨，不得不私出高價於黑市中求貨，遂造成黑市之價格。故居今日欲使黑市消滅，第一當求原料來源之充分，同時外國原料，當求替代品之發明。第二應放寬限價，使有貨者有出貨之機會。譬如二十支棉紗，官價五千五百元，但許多布廠無從購得，求諸黑市，尤恐　法，勢不得不停工减工，而布疋日少，布商自更居奇。以致說奢謂「價格愈限而黑價愈高。」痛乎言之。故目前在加緊戰時生產時代，疏通來源，增多生產，固屬治本辦法，但放寬限價，使有貨者願意出貨，實爲消滅黑市之一法。說者謂限價放寬，恐黑價更高一節，其實官價旣寬，有貨者孰願再事居奇？未免杞人之憂。惟定官價時，務須根據原料成本，工人工食工資，以及一切開繳實數，用科學方法，作精密計算，完全以公正平允之方式出之，則一切問題，自然迎刃而解。</p>
<p>（三）復興上海工廠，在目前爲不可能之事。維持殘餘之工廠，已覺萬分困難，何也？運輸艱難，手續麻煩，內地原料已感來源之不易，成品出路，除供囤戶吸收外，亦覺十分困難，一也。電力須受限制，二也。工人　糧，不易購取，三也。出品成沐，與限價相差過鉅，四也。夫工廠之生存，爲原料與成品，換言之，來路與出路，今來去二路俱窮，如何可望復興？無已，在最低限度中求增加生產，則希望仰給於內地之　產品原料，今後可藉交通機構之健全，運輸方法之簡捷，源源運入，俾所造之成品，亦得漸漸輸往內地，以實踐內外物資交流之目的。同時應改良機械設備廣羅技術人才，采用工廠合理化，期以最少之時間，人力，經濟，以收最大之效能。則成本旣廉，出品亦夥，中國工業中心之上海，或能先做到增加生產之一步，再談復興工業，當不致徒托空言。</p>
<p>（四）華商工廠，雖未脫幼稚之階級，但年來經努力經營以後，關於機械設備，技術改進，出品精良，已爲國內外人士一致所公認。尤其是許多老廠，以積儲原料之富，商譽之隆，財產之鉅，値此物價暴騰之時代，其股票之爲人爭購，自屬當然。且華股交易，亦屬促成中國資本市塲之基礎，其交易旣屬正當，亦未始非增多生產資金籌碼，以促進中國工業之發展。此種正常買賣，自屬無可非議。惟以股票公司設立太多，或不免有競爭買賣之事，如果純粹現貨交易，根據固定財產，斟酌未來趨勢，定一折衷至當之股票價格，亦屬無可非議。回想已往之華商證券交易所，只有買賣公債，目前早經停頓，且平時不做華股交易，根本與華商工廠不發生直接關係，甚多隔膜。至洋商衆業公所，亦已停頓許久。今後欲造成正當交易之正式市塲，應從復興華商證券交易所入手，就原有人員參加華商股票業領袖開誠協商，早日組織成立，以專事華股之交易，有合法之組織，行合法之買賣，則糾紛甚久之華商股票業問題，自然完全解決矣。（五）此次日本朝野毅然實行緩和物資移動限制，與信任中國商人自動組織全國商業統制總會一事，各方一致感佩，認爲此一政策之轉變，實使中國工商業有一綫轉機之希望。惟此會之成，責任重大，使命艱巨，自當黽勉從事，出以公正坦白之態度，不　私，不瞻顧情面，凡幹部與各部分人員，均須廉潔自修之人士，實心實力，全力爲正當工商界服務，使此項艱巨工作，圓滿進行，以副各方之期望。關於物資移動之手續，不惟求其嚴密，更須求其簡捷。關於審核之結果，不惟求其詳細，更須求其公平，希望在市區內市區外物資之移動，不但責成同業公會負責查報，且須加以多方面之抽　密探，俾取巧作弊，或骫法亂紀，以小施其伎倆者，有所忌憚，則一年半載以後，或可略覩成效，是在在事者之能否努力，與是否有毅力決心如何耳。</p>
<p>栗本先生：那末大體的物價問題，諸位先生已經說得很詳盡了。這是非常艱鉅的問題，要說總是還可以說出多少的話來。我現在要離開了理論，講到實際問題。在從前銀子存在—所謂可以安心硬幣的存在的當時，對於貨物的看法，以爲只消是錢，是任何東西都置得來的。如今却相反地轉換了，是以爲只消有貨物，是任何錢都換得來的心理狀態了。把這一般的看法，使回復到原來只消是錢任何東西都置得來的心理狀態，不是很必要嗎？那末用着什麼方法呢？那不消說是在把貨物處於充分行銷，俾要的大概可以買得來的狀態之下。但是現在的狀態，却不是那麼樣儘要儘可買得來的狀態。那以爲只要使貨物豐富以安定物價，對於通貨的信賴，就得藉以穩固的話，實行起來是很困難的。</p>
<p>因之，雖然這裏沒有怎樣多的貨物，尚且足以使一般人安心的，便是這次所發表的物資移動限制的緩和；同時把所限制的事務，前此由官方執行的，現在由着民間團體全國商業統制總會來運用，對於一般人心所給與的安心感，不是很巨大的嗎？因此，這所謂全國商業統制總會的責任，是非常重大的。若是其職權的運用一誤，流弊也很大。像那樣由着這個總會，使得不多的貨物多起來的話，雖然有點兒可笑（笑），但須知道，那樣說，無非是使得人心安定的一個宣傳方法。最後更要申說一句話，那就是若要道統制極順調地遂行，須得把農工商三業，用着非常妥善不備不倚的方法活用才好。</p>

<p>今天是第十二屆兒童節，在這日子以前，上海一般商店，已在橱窗里把兒童玩具裝點得花花綠綠，讓一般有福的人們帶着有福的孩子們去購買，各個小學校裏，也正在籌備慶祝兒童節的節目。可是，我們却也可以見到無數流浪街頭的兒童，一天得不到兩餐，晚上也找不到睡眼的地方。</p>
<p>他們也有兒童節，但兒童節給予他們的，不是幸福，不是快樂，不是敎育，當然，那裏還談得到使他們明白做兒童的責任，他們所享受到的祇是飢寒，苦難，以及惡劣環境對他們的層層壓迫。</p>
<p>物價一天天高漲。上海本來有的三十多個救濟團體，不但已沒有收容新難童的多餘能力，就維持原有的敎養設施，也已臨到了「捉襟見肘」的地步！</p>
<p>本報早看到了這難童的問題，實在是橫在面前一個嚴重的社會問題。所在在兩個月前就曾爲難童各校呼籲，及遣往鄉村的建議。並於四月三日—兒童節的前一日四時至六時，假座美琪大樓學術講座室，邀集對難童問題一向熱心的知名之士和難童敎養團體的實際工作者，舉行兒童福利座談會，討論的問題有：（一）難童經費籌集，（二）難童糧食採辦，（三）難童營養衛生，（四）難童敎材課本，（五）難童勞作生產，（六）難童品性訓導，（七）難童敎育改進，（八）難童自立與出路，（九）難童敎養工作，（十）難童移鄉生活，（十一）難童敎養團體合作，（十二）紀念今年兒童節應急救街　。四時正，參加座談會的各界人士，都陸續的到齊了。計有上海兒童圖書館理事長祖蔭博士，女靑年會總幹事邱麗英女士幼幼敎養院董事長陳靑士博士等三十餘人。首由本報社會服務處黃警頑君。報吿召集座談會的意義。大意說：今天是兒童節的前一日，本報特召集兒童福利座談會以爲紀念。目下物價高漲，難童生活痛苦。本報對難童敎養一向很關心，故特邀請諸君子，各就討論題目，發揮高見：並希望從今以後，難童敎養團體互助團結，爲已收容敎養的難童和正待收容的街頭難童造福。繼由胡祖蔭博士就難童敎養院合作問題，分消極和積極兩方面，發揮他的意見。接着，幼幼院董事長陳靑士，中華慈幼協會總幹事丁秉南，靑年會少年事業委員會主席陳已生，福幼院院長兒童營養專家丁福老，土山灣孤兒院院長王鶴峯，兒童保育院院長李瑞華，難童敎養所所長陳徵帆，上海貧兒院院長鐘志剛，幼幼敎養院主任阮斌，上海社會福利局楊科長等，或就學術上或根據實際經騐，貢獻他們對今後上海慈幼團體的互助合作，及推行難童敎養事業的意見，都是極可珍貴的材料，足供關心和從事難童敎養者的參考。一直到七點半鐘，才宣吿閉幕。關於這次座談會的詳細記錄，一俟整理完畢，另行發表。（佳木）</p>

<p>日本著名學者田中耕太郎博士，及鈴木竹雄敎授，於日前來滬，本報陳社長特於昨日下午假座康樂酒店舉行茶會歡迎，到有友邦田中領事，岩井領事，中國文雄白，柳雨生，夏劍丞，高吹萬，陶亢德，郭宗賢，楊光政，工商界李權時，金宗城，姚慶三，許曉初，趙晋卿，聞閘亭，（以姓氏筆劃爲良）等；首由</p>
<p>陳彬龢致詞</p>
<p>略謂：「今天茶會的意義，是歡迎田中博士和鈴木敎授來華，田中博士不但是日本的法學權威，也是世界著名學者，他這次來華目的，希望研究中國的商業習慣，並溝通中日文化工作，今天特介紹與諸位相見，承諸位於百忙中參加，十分感謝。在座中最年高的是聞蘭亭先生，今年七十四歲，最年輕是的柳雨生先生，今年二十六歲，他如敎育界前輩夏劍丞先生，詩人高吹萬先生，都是難得參加任何集會的，今天特來與田中博士見面，更是値得欣幸的事。」</p>
<p>田中博士致詞</p>
<p>「這次我們兩人到貴國來，以此機會承蒙貴國有着光榮歷史的申報社長，在文化政治等範圍內有着光輝的閱歷的陳彬龢先生，親切招待，舉行這會，爲我們介紹貴國文化界及經濟界諸位名流，又蒙賜以懇切而且過獎的介紹詞，我們對於陳先生的這番盛意，衷心引爲光榮，而應該深表感謝感激之忱的。又對於岩井領事的多多照拂，也深表感謝。近來我國同胞，到貴國來訪者很多，然像我們這樣能和貴國諸位名流親切相　，却是難得的。我們一定不忘今天所受諸位的盛　，很想努力把這番盛情，傳給日本的有識階級。</p>
<p>抑所謂中日親善，爲我國同胞向來所主張的，然而要使這個主張不單單止於空洞的口頭禪，我們以爲非兩國國民大家拿出政治的，經濟的，文化的，一切的力，而拼命努力不可。因此，兩國國民之間，就有愛的必要。而爲了愛，就有敬的必要。而爲了敬，就有知的必要。知生敬，敬更發展爲愛，這樣，真正的親善方能完成。所心，知就是根本。然而知是不容易的。孫中山先生曾作了知難行易之說。誠然，不知而行是容易的，但是爲禍則沒有比這更大哩，</p>
<p>可是現在我們兩國民之間，這樣的「知」果真充分存在嗎？關於這點，我們不咎互相的不知對造，而以爲必須反省自己的不知。所謂「以不知爲不知，是爲知，」就是這個意思。貴國有識的主導者諸位，一定正以謙遜的態度反省着，以爲非把日本更加好好地理解不可。我們日本人，則以爲貴國諸位，由着明治以來多數的留學生，又由着書籍，一定相當地知道日本——至少關於現代的日本——的。我們日本人對於貴國古典的文化，自古以來雖然相當地接近着，可是一般的說來，則必須謙遜地承認對於現代中國的理解，這是非常不充分的。像鄙人那樣，無疑就是其中之一。然而關於這點，便有請加考慮的必要，那就是日本的理解貴國，一般來說，比之貴國諸位的理解日本——日本固有的國體當作別論——却可說是困難數倍。貴國有着四千餘年悠久的歷史，版圖的廣大，達日本幾十倍，而此地域，又各具地方的特色，言語習俗經濟不相盡同；又在社會層，幅員也很廣，上下的懸隔很大。因此，我們縱令以知道貴國自負，那也往往不免有「盲人摸大象一端」之感；所以，我們日本人要理解貴國，其努力非比貴國諸位要理解日本的努力遠爲巨大不可。幸而日本於旣往十數年來，對於貴國的政治，經濟，歷史，文化等的研究熱，勃然而興，而且那完全是離開了政治的意圖的，純粹出於探求真理的情熱的。像這樣的對於貴國文化的關心和興味，已着着成爲有益的研究而得成果，正欲有以貢獻於兩國間聯係的强化哩。現在全世界和東亞的形勢，正要求着我們兩國的結合務益鞏固，尤其是東亞秩序的維持，加在我們兩國的雙肩上。不過兩國之政治的提携，當以物質的和精神的二要素爲必要條件，那就是經濟和文化，經濟是體，那把它視爲等閑的理想主義，那把它視爲等閑的理想主義，必須排斥；文化是精神，那把它視爲等閑的唯物主義，不能爲之左袒。我們非把政治的提携，由經濟及文化的提携來作保證不可；否則政治的提携就不能强化。幸而我們日本和貴國之　，經濟的及文化的，或相互的，交換着其特有的產物，又藉以爲同一目的而協力之物質的及精神的基礎，也在自然的及歷史的意味之上存在着。即就我們數十年來埋頭從事着關於貴國之商業法制的研究來說，也可心知道這事的。尤其是四年來所研究着的關於貴國之商業習慣，例如同業公會，商業人員之訓練·合股·牙行·等諸制度，以及極端重視信用的商人道德，而知道那是受着異於近世歐洲及歐化的日本商業制度之家族主義的秩序，而爲合作體制的經濟倫理所支配的，並且那決非不合理的退　，而是很合理的進取，是表示着貴國民族堅强　　活潑的生命者。由是，我們在學問上得到了很多的啟示，並且由此對於貴國發生了深深的敬愛之心。那實在是對於把國家社會引入分裂危險之個人主義的資本主義，一個有力的嘗試。</p>
<p>鄙人不好意思再說許多話；不過，世界的一切民庭，是各有長處和缺點的。我們應該和個人的的修身一樣，對於民族，也必須把自己的缺點老實看出；同時，必須承認贊許他人的長處；要不然，則各民族就不能融合，也不能向上。我們以爲對於別人，應該採取這樣的態度，即：必須認許人家的長處是其本質而不記其缺點。無論在什麼時代，無論在什麼國家，并不是由某一個無賴漢或怠惰者來決定的。我們對別人必須其真實所在，而於其理想的狀態以爲判斷。我們盯住惟由貴國的最高理想，真正的目標，方能正確理解貴國，評價貴國。</p>
<p>我們今天得和貴國的站在經濟及文化界最高峰的諸位成爲知交，由此機會對於貴國深深体得知和敬和愛，殊覺欣幸。費了諸位不少時間，有勞清聽，抱歉之至。并謝今天的招待。」</p>
<p>柳雨生詞</p>
<p>「方才田中博士的偉論，殊有同感，博士說：日本人士對華認識，不能以目前所了解者爲已定，有待進一步研究的更多，本人深以爲然，而中國人士之對日認識不足，亦復如是，也須作更進一步的研究日本情形，方能達到真正親善目的。中日親善本不自今日始，自古即稱「兄弟之邦，」近來研究日本問題的雖有，可是仍嫌不夠，古諺謂「不患人之不我知，患我之不知人，」盼望中日兩國人士共體此義，加緊研究，才不負田中博士，鈴木教授所期待之盛意。」</p>
<p>姚慶三詞</p>
<p>「田中博士傾　對中日兩國　具的了解與認識，不勝同情，不幸的中日事變，如能本此原則，即不致發生。當時中國人的意見，以爲日本經過三年戰爭，經濟必趨崩潰，假令重慶政權能明瞭日本能支持六年之戰事，復能對英美作戰而勝利，也許不致拖戰。而日本國內，當初也有一部份人對中國缺乏理解，以致相互估計錯誤，促成事變，實深遺憾，欲期糾正與補救，惟有賴雙方真誠合作。鄙人在中日事變後，南京政府未成立前，即感覺中日乃兄弟之邦，亟宜早日主張可分二種：（一）對日親善，（二）對日和平懷疑，關於後者，非可以武力使其改變態度，希望有親善之事實，合中國獨立與復興，方能改正一般對各平懷疑之觀念。最近日本改變對華政策後，中國人民方面已有好的反應，如能照田中博士所說做去，深信中國人民，必能做到真真合作。」</p>

<h3 id="c36">評論　統制經濟的條件 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>中國的經濟，現下正在趨向統制經濟之道。我們衷心希望中國統制經濟建設成功，運用成功，既抱這種希望，所以不得不指摘若干問題，期望對此採取妥善的措置。</p>
<p>經濟統制求其成功的第一條件，就是要整飭國家機構。經濟統制必須要設定一定的計劃，把這一定計劃分飭經濟界遵行，同時還得要監視其實行。國家爲了要做到這一點起見，那麼關於調查經濟情勢，設定計劃，必先有雄厚的力量。又爲督飭經濟畀曬你，監視其有無違反事項，并對於違反者的處罰問題，先得要有健全的行政機構和廉潔的官吏。這一點隻要聯想起日本及德國的經濟統制情形，自會明白的。然則中國的現狀是怎樣呢？用日本及德國的尺度來秤一秤，相差太遠吧！應該改良的地方實在不少，這是無庸諱言的。</p>
<p>統制經濟的建設和動用，單靠政府的指導是不夠的，必須國民自動起來協力。這可以說是第二個條件。實現這第二個條件的方途，就是愛國心的發揚和國民的再組織。講到這裏，我們又要提出日本和德國的實例了。日本暫且不提，就說是德國吧，納粹黨作爲國民組織的神經系統，這對於維繫政府和國民的工作，有何等偉大的貢獻，不用明說，也是大家知道的。發揚戰爭意識，加強黨部組織，是參戰後中國的當務之急，也就是推進統制經濟的必需要求。</p>
<p>在實行統制經濟的場合，一國的經濟，必須要發展到最高度。這可謂是第三個條件。在這種發展階段上，產業的主要部門，往往有已經獨佔的企業或少數巨大企業存在。換一句話說，這是經濟界本身發展的結果，已經有了組織化，故而以此爲對象的經濟統制是極容易的。日德英美關於這一點，都有良好的實例，反看中國的現狀，我們不得不認爲相去太遠了。</p>
<p>中國統制經濟的性格，現在未必明確表現出來，但是民間自治的統制倒有很大功效。這是中國的現實，也就是唯一的可能方法，要憑這樣困難方法來達到所期的目的，需要政府方面民間方面加倍努力。其努力如何，姑置不論，總之深刻反省上述條件是比什麼都重要的。（雲鵬：譯自四月一日大陸新報）</p>

<p>上海社訊　本市米穀，雜糧，牲畜，食油，酒類，食糖及茶葉等七業公會昨日中午聯合假金門飯店舉行公宴，來賓有糧食部部長顧寶衡氏，上海市糧食局長張顯之，糧食部管理司長尹以瑄，上海市社會福利局局長孫鳴岐，糧食部幫辦董志愷，王肅亮，米糧產銷總管理處紀仲石及水產局長姜可生等。各業方面，到陸文韶，蔣石稚，陳子彞，符前耕，解梅生張大連，薛梅亭姜雅臣，黃燕堂等約共八十餘人。席間顧部長發表演說，原詞如下：</p>
<p>糧食統制華方自辦</p>
<p>糧食管理，事變以前，并無任何組織，漫無統制，全爲自由經濟狀況。事變以後，日方爲軍需故，在糧食方面，始加統制，迨經折衡　俎，方將糧食統制事宜，交由華方自辦，乃成立糧食委員會。其時米價增高，各項統制，亦難發展，況食米一項，有軍米與民米之分。華中產米地域，一部份劃爲軍需米區，另一部份　爲民需米區。在民米區內，食米移　，限定某一地段內，須備採辦證，如移出指定範圍以外，須有護照。考其目的，在抑抵米價，但事實上，一地米價，往往隨他處米價漲落而有變動，故當局目標，不能完全達到。軍需米區內，產米一部份當地　　，餘則充爲軍米。</p>
<p>設聯營社保障商市</p>
<p>去年接任糧食委員會會委員長後，即着手組織聯營社，使各關係業商人能充分活動，同時對於國計民生，亦有裨益，此制先在丹陽，金壇，南京各地推行成績良好，以後當秉此方針進行。在各地設立米糧聯營社，收買米糧，然後賣予中央米糧產銷總管理處。該處在一二月內，即將改爲「中央儲糧局」。但聯營社間可有交易，此在保　米糧商人合法利益，定有貢獻。惟囤積操縱等情，殆可消滅。糧食部察酌各市縣米糧聯營社，關於業務上聯繫情形，劃分若干區，由部設區監理官管理，即每一米糧聯營社之地方，任何商人均不得單獨經營與聯營社同一性質之業務。</p>
<p>雜糧等業分設公會</p>
<p>查糧食委員會改爲糧食部後，管轄糧食包括米，麥，雜糧，棉花，牲畜，調味品（糖，油，酒，醋，醬等），罐頭食品及飲料（汽水，茶等）等項。然最近國府頒佈工商公會暫行條例，糧部所轄物品，除米因不受商統會統制者外，其餘概須分別成立公會。　是之故，今後米穀一項，由米糧產銷總管理處通過米穀聯營社予以節制。他台雜糧，油，糖，酒，茶等類。則分別組織公會，各地同等性質之公會，再集合在滬成爲各業聯合會，由全國商統會管轄。大致在系統方面，糧食各業除米穀外，一縣或數縣一區設一公會，人事支配則由糧食部，糧食局及關係業共同商定之。不參加公會者，不得經營各該公會所屬之買賣，公會分組辦事，商店得視其營業類別參加一組或數組，參加一公會或數公會，公會內亦有監理官之設，其職司在聯絡而已。</p>
<p>萬事須重國計民生</p>
<p>溯自全國商統會成立以還，各業對於物資移運，即可完全自由，實則不然，物資之移運，今後因不必如以往之複雜，但步驟上必須注意者猶多，商店如須將物資自甲處移運至乙處，必須先呈准關係業公會，公會須呈准聯合會，聯合會須向全國商統會申請。商統會之上，另有關係之調經機關在焉。如此一過程如能貫穿，移運自無問題可言，否則貿然行事，定必遭遇困難。本人秉性素直，知無不言，言無不盡，希望糧食各業能明瞭現行統制體系，米穀業遵照法定組成聯營社，雜糧等業速即整飭同業公會組織機構，再就各地公會，在滬構成各業三省二市聯合會。如此戰時糧食政策，可望實現，統制效率既可加強，民眾糧食威脅，亦可消除。丁此時艱，萬事須以國計民生爲重，愿與諸君共勉之。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Hope for Children's Day <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since 1931, when the China Children's Welfare Association initiated Children's Day on April 4th, grand gatherings have been held annually across various regions to commemorate it. Today marks the twelfth such Children's Day. We revisit the memorial presented by the Children's Welfare Association, which stated: "The rise and fall of a nation depend on its people; the strength or weakness of a people depends on its children. Children are the future masters of the nation and the central point for cultural transmission... to ensure everyone has compassionate thoughts towards children and assumes the responsibility of caring for them, while also enabling children to recognize their own position... to lay the foundation for a strong nation and a strong race." These words carry profound meaning. Although there's Children's Day every year and we annually offer perfunctory commemorations, after twelve years of promotion, how much active work has been done in practice to benefit children? Therefore, today, we do not wish to make timely articles of celebration or elaborate theories, but rather offer some minimal suggestions with a critical attitude.</p>
<p>Firstly, taking Shanghai as an example, children wandering the streets, reduced to being little beggars, are seen everywhere, covered in dirt, riddled with sores, with feeble pleas and emaciated, begging hands. Who doesn't have children? How can we bear to let them wander? Who says they are the masters of the future while they are aimlessly wandering the streets? The responsibility of raising these wandering children, who already lack protection, should be borne by society. When necessary, they should be forcibly taken in, and they cannot be allowed to continue wandering.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are also children who originally have parents or guardians who are raising them, but due to extreme poverty and lack of land, they simply cannot afford to raise them. These are children from extremely impoverished and hidden poverty families. Although they don't go so far as to wander, they live in constant hunger, let alone receive education. The number of these poor children must far exceed the number of wandering children, and society should show compassion to help raise them.</p>
<p>Currently, there are many charitable organizations in Shanghai that specialize in children's welfare, and their enthusiasm is commendable. However, to thoroughly achieve the above two objectives, there is no doubt that it is necessary to expand the scope. The most important thing is to hope that those with money and power in society will deeply sympathize with this significant work of nurturing the nation, jointly exert their efforts, replenish the funds of children's welfare organizations, and assign them to undertake the above-mentioned work.</p>
<p>What has been said above leans towards the aspect of "nurturing," which we believe is a prerequisite. As for the aspect of "education," it is, of course, equally important. Many plans already exist, so we will not elaborate on them here for now.</p>
<p>We further hope that next year, on this day, we will no longer see wandering children on the streets. In that case, today's verbal celebration will have achieved practical results, and only then will it be worth celebrating greatly.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Prospects for German Submarine Warfare <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>In the half-month period from March 1st to 15th, the German Navy sank a total of 500,000 tons of enemy ships. Furthermore, in the four days following that, in a raid in the North Atlantic, they annihilated 32 British and American escort convoys, totaling 204,000 tons, setting a record unprecedented in the history of commercial warfare. In November of last year, the German submarine fleet sank 1,035,000 tons of British and American ships in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, the highest record since the start of the war. However, the results achieved in the entire month of March are expected to be no less than the aforementioned figures. Admiral Karl Dönitz, the highest authority on German submarine warfare, has only been in command of the navy for a month since succeeding Grand Admiral Raeder, yet he has already achieved such results. The improvement of the German naval lineup has instilled new terror in the British and Americans.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, Germany has used submarine warfare to disrupt commerce as its primary means of operation against Britain. It has devoted its full efforts to building a large number of submarines and training crews. Therefore, the results of submarine warfare have increased month by month, with an average of 800,000 tons sunk per month since May of last year. Except for January, when the weather was unfavorable for submarine operations, the number of sinkings has increased each month. The British and Americans are deeply troubled by the threat of these German submarines. At the end of last year, Britain established an anti-submarine warfare committee, with Prime Minister Churchill as the chairman and the Minister of Military Affairs, the Chief of the Air Staff, the Secretary of the Navy Alexander, and the Secretary of the Air Sinclair as members, to vigorously study countermeasures to curb the submarines. As a result, the reduction in the number of sinkings in January of this year made Churchill proudly claim the success of the countermeasures committee, even declaring that the crisis of submarine warfare was a thing of the past. The new tactics of Marshal Dönitz's submarines, which were newly tested, instantly overturned Churchill's optimism from the root. The British naval authority Winster was killed in mid-February, and the ships on the anti-axis side are now on the verge of complete annihilation. In the previous great war, German submarines sailed around the North Sea to launch attacks in the Atlantic. This time, the situation is completely reversed. Separated from the British mainland by only a narrow strip of water, strong bases have been built on the south coast of Belgium and France, ensuring freedom to attack the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The threat faced by Britain and the United States is even greater compared to the previous war.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, submarine countermeasures proposed by British and American experts include stepping up the construction of submarines and increasing the current escort method, that is, the ratio of one destroyer for every fifteen ships in a convoy, to three ships for every one. In order to make the speed of the ships counteract the surface speed of German submarines, the speed of the ships should be increased to over 23 knots. These countermeasures are now the central topic of discussion. Assuming these proposals are reasonable, it is impossible to implement them immediately given the British and American shipbuilding plans and shipbuilding techniques. On the contrary, the rapid increase in German submarines, according to the estimate of the Daily Herald, has increased eightfold from 70 at the start of the war. Moreover, Germany is building ships at a rate of one per day in secret locations, in factories that are absolutely safe from air raids. The implementation of British and American countermeasures seems impossible, while the number of German submarines is increasing dramatically. In contrast, what will be the state of commercial warfare in the future? The spring season, which is suitable for submarine activity, has arrived. On the Eastern Front, we are eagerly awaiting the German army's comeback. At the same time, we also have great expectations for the future of the commercial warfare implemented by Dönitz.

<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, which opened on the 1st, completed its review and approval of proposals from various parties on the 3rd. More than 50 items were passed, including the following major items: (1) Suggesting that the government negotiate with friendly nations to manage the Boxer Indemnity funds to promote cultural undertakings; (2) The Standing Council should determine the expenditure for branch donations, establish a shrine to enshrine the heroic spirits of Chinese and Japanese war dead and civilians at the original site of the Leifeng Pagoda in West Lake, establish science awards and Sino-Japanese language study grants, and establish branch organization regulations to clarify the system and strengthen the connection between the head office and branches; (3) The head office and local branches should invite cultural institutions from friendly nations to investigate and compile significant historical sites of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange; (4) Conscientiously organize an annual Japanese language speech contest; (5) The head office's art organization should send specialists to Japan to study music and replicate musical instruments; (6) The head office should petition the government to establish a National Academy of Drama and establish art museums in various regions; (7) The head office should send specialists to review the scientific indexing method invented by Yu Shuzhang to see if it is conducive to cultural progress and make it practical; (8) The head office should contact the Ministry of Education to convene a conference of Chinese and Japanese experts in children's education and prominent women to establish future strategies for children's education; (9) Each branch should set up a library as soon as possible and be responsible for running a mobile library to enlighten the public; (10) Pass the head office's ordering of Sino-Japanese cultural publications issued by friendly nations and distribute them to each branch for reference; (11) Pass the compilation of a directory of Sino-Japanese cultural figures; (12) Chinese and Japanese writers should translate classical works from each other, and the head office should suggest that the Ministry of Education instruct the National Institute of Compilation and Translation to add teaching materials such as Japanese reading texts, grammar, and conversation; (Omitted)... (15) Pass the head office's review and implementation of the resolutions of the First National Congress that have not yet been implemented, and announce the progress of the handling at any time. The Congress closed at noon on the 3rd, with Speaker Chu Minyi leading the closing ceremony and giving a closing speech. He first expressed his gratification that the Congress had successfully concluded, and then pointed out that the focus of each case was on implementation, and that there should be no resolutions without action, or decisions without implementation. Finally, he expressed his gratitude to the representatives attending the Congress. Afterwards, Vice Speaker Jiang Kanghu approved the Congress Declaration and read it out. Then, Speaker Chu read out the congratulatory telegram to Chairman Wang, and all the attending representatives bowed to Speaker Chu to express their respect. The closing ceremony was then announced at the sound of music. That evening (3rd) at 7:00 PM, the Chairman hosted a banquet at the association's Xingya Hall to commend the attending representatives. After the banquet, there were entertainment programs, including domestically produced films, which were very exciting. The declaration of the Congress and the congratulatory telegram to the Chairman are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Congress Declaration</p>
<p>This time, the Second National Congress of this association gathered representatives from China and Japan, as well as leaders from the cultural world, which is a great honor. This Congress has made significant progress compared to the previous Congress. At the time of the previous Congress, there were only five branches in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Wuhan. This time, there are four more branches in Anhui, Anqing, Suhuai, and Subei, as well as branches in various places. The development of members has been quite significant. This is the first thing to be gratified about. The previous Congress was held in Hankou. Although there were many representatives from various places, there were only three from North China. This time, there are five from Beijing, two from Tianjin, one from Qingdao, two from Hebei, and two from Shandong. It can be seen that the cultural unity is becoming stronger and stronger, and the Republic of China is becoming more and more unified. This is the second thing to be gratified about. At the previous Congress, although there were many Japanese people in Wuhan, there were no specially sent representatives. This time, there are as many as fourteen well-known figures in the Japanese cultural world who have come to China. This is enough to show that the future of cooperation between China and Japan is becoming closer and closer. This is the third thing to be gratified about. At the time of the previous Congress, the National Government declared that it would share weal and woe with friendly nation Japan at the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. After a lapse of one year, one month, and one day, that is, January 9th of this year, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, and has moved from sharing weal and woe to sharing life and death. Therefore, friendly nation Japan abolished the unequal treaties, returned the Japanese exclusive concessions in various places, as well as the embassy area, and the Gulangyu Public Concession, creating the most glorious page in history, and forming a great era of modernity. At this association, we feel the infinite prospects of the future even more. This is the fourth thing to be gratified about. Although the era is greater, the responsibility is also greater. We must uphold the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism and the purpose of Chairman Wang's New National Movement, and strive forward with one heart and one mind. The Book of Changes says, "A scholar cannot but be resolute and persevering, for his burden is heavy and his road is long. He takes benevolence as his own task. Is it not heavy? He will die and then it will be over. Is it not far?" Today, it is even more appropriate to encourage ourselves and others with this purpose, so that everyone can be like this, as a spiritual and material general mobilization of Greater East Asia, in order to live up to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions and Chairman Wang's Mingjiao. Lying down, I believe that China and Japan have always been brotherly countries, countries as close as lips and teeth. However, in the past few decades, they have been alienated and provoked by Britain and the United States, so they have inevitably had friction, to the point of going to war in the same room, and boiling beans with their stalks. Speaking of this, it is heartbreaking. Fortunately, the wise men of the two countries have suddenly realized that in the future, to coexist and prosper together, we must first seek the communication of Sino-Japanese culture and the creation of East Asian culture, and use each other's strengths to make up for each other's weaknesses. This is the main point of Chairman's Wang instruction at this Congress. I hope that all our comrades across the country will work hard to promote it, so that all ethnic groups in East Asia will know and discuss it together, and work together to achieve it, so that they can jointly shoulder the responsibility of this great era and then they can live up to the mission of this great era. Sincerely speaking.</p>
<p>Congratulatory Telegram to the Chairman</p>
<p>Chairman, This time, the Second Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association was held in Beijing, and we were deeply moved by your instructions. Now that the task of the Congress has been completed, the colleagues have returned to their respective locations, and they will convey your instructions to comrades in various places, and strive to grasp their beliefs, be selfless, in order to live up to the expectations of restoring China and defending East Asia. Before leaving, I respectfully implore you to consider this. The Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): The National Government orders (April 3rd, 32nd year of the Republic): Liu Yufen, Chief of General Staff of the Military Commission, Army General, is experienced and knowledgeable in military affairs. In the Second Army Group, he repeatedly performed meritorious service in battle, and was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Front Army. He served as the Chairman of the governments of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, governing the army and caring for the people. When the National Government returned to the capital, he was given special trust, selected as a Standing Committee member of the Military Commission, and appointed as the Director of the Kaifeng Pacification Headquarters, assisting in the peace movement and coordinating military affairs. He was diligent and dedicated, and contributed to the country. Last year, he was transferred to Chief of General Staff of the Military Commission, and his responsibilities increased and his work became more difficult. He was concerned about the country and hurt his health, and continued to work while ill. He was repeatedly given leave to recuperate, but he still did not recover, and he continued to shoulder the difficult task. He eventually died of overwork and illness. Remembering his virtuous deeds, we are deeply saddened. Liu Yufen is to be given preferential treatment in accordance with the example of Army Generals who died of overwork, and given funeral expenses of 20,000 yuan. The Military Commission will send personnel to handle the funeral and hold a public burial. His life's work should be recorded in the national history to commend his loyalty and comfort his spirit. This order, Chairman of the National Government, Wang Zhao Ming.</p>

<p>Xinjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): Zhang, the Premier of Manchukuo, met with a group of reporters today and issued a statement, the general idea being that Japanese Prime Minister Tōjō's decision to visit Manchukuo has been approved by our Emperor, who granted him an audience to pay his respects, and to celebrate our country's development over the past decade and to express gratitude for our country's cooperation in the Greater East Asia War. Prime Minister Tōjō is very busy with political affairs, but his visit to our country is truly appreciated. Previously, Prime Minister Tōjō had visited Nanjing to meet with the Chairman of the Chinese National Government, and now he has come to our country again, which makes the relations between China, Japan, and Manchukuo closer and closer, and his contribution to the construction of the new order in Greater East Asia is great. The relations between Japan and Manchukuo have always been extremely close. Now that China has also joined this axis, China, Japan, and Manchukuo should work together to advance and complete the Greater East Asia War. Moreover, China, Japan, and Manchukuo are united by morality, so there is nothing to fear from Chongqing and the United States. We are confident that the final victory will belong to us. Since the National Government returned to the capital, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, it has been proceeding step by step on the road of restoration and construction. Recently, Japan returned the concessions in China, which has given a great shock to the Chinese people. Now the Chinese people have recognized Japan's true intentions, and more and more people are breaking away from Chongqing. Therefore, the anti-Japanese and national salvation promoted by Chongqing is meaningless. Fortunately, China, under the guidance of Chairman Wang, has embarked on the road of restoration. We are friends with this new China, and we will cooperate to build a new order in Greater East Asia. We are confident that we will be able to complete it.</p>

<p>Rome, 3rd (Central News Agency): According to the Stefani Agency, Switzerland will also renounce extraterritorial rights in China soon. The Swiss Federal Council, in the last meeting, the government replied to a question saying, "The Sino-Swiss Treaty of Friendship signed on June 13, 1918, does not hinder the legitimate aspirations of the Chinese people. On the one hand, if the treaty grants Switzerland the same privileges as other countries based on the most-favored-nation clause, then on the other hand, it was solemnly declared at that time that Switzerland was prepared to renounce extraterritorial rights at the same time as other countries. This declaration still retains its full value and applicability. The time for this declaration appears to be approaching."</p>

<h3 id="e16">On the Road from Gafsa to Gabès: German Tank Units Counterattack; Denying Claims of Anglo-American Forces Meeting There; British Forces Suffer Setbacks in the Mountainous Regions of Northern Tunisia <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a German official news agency report last night, the German and Italian tank corps under General Rommel, after a long period of prepared planning, have achieved the final convergence with the troops of Lieutenant General Arnim. The British Eighth Army and the British and American forces fighting in Tunisia have repeatedly prevented the realization of this convergence. The major objective of the Allied large-scale offensive over the past nine days was precisely this, as the Allies deeply feared that the collaboration of these two parts of the Axis forces would greatly enhance their defenses in Tunisia.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters war correspondent with the American forces in Tunisia, early yesterday morning, the German forces launched a counterattack against the American forces with tank units along the road from Gafsa to Gabès. German artillery was very active, utilizing several concealed and observation posts, making it difficult for the British forces to detect. On Wednesday evening, American forces attacked northwest of Maknassy with tanks and infantry, met with fierce artillery fire and aerial attacks from the German forces. On the same evening, German aircraft were also very active in the El Guettar area, bombing for several hours. Yesterday morning, more than thirty German bombers and fighters attacked the vanguard of American tank units and supporting artillery units. At the same time, the Allied headquarters denied reports that the American forces under General Patton and the British Eighth Army under General Montgomery had met on the road from Gabès to Gafsa. According to the German side, the situation in northern Tunisia has improved, and German positions have been consolidated. Furthermore, according to the German News Agency, the British forces continued their attempts to encircle the right flank of the German and Italian forces on Thursday, but were ultimately defeated by the mobile strategy of the Axis forces. In the mountainous regions of northern Tunisia, German mechanized units, as the British forces began their encirclement, suddenly penetrated the flanks of the advancing British tank columns. This extraordinary offensive threw the British forces into disarray, causing them to retreat westward in a panic, suffering heavy losses in manpower and materials. The British forces changed their strategy and switched to attacking individually with small units, but the results were equally ineffective. Between Sened and Téboursouk, German and Italian ground forces, under effective air cover, attacked British anti-aircraft positions and artillery positions. German assault troops attacked British positions in the southeast of Testour and El Bardo, destroying two Wiltshire artillery positions. After a fierce close-quarters battle, the British forces left over three hundred corpses behind, and many were taken prisoner.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a Berlin report, German air force units fiercely attacked anti-Axis tanks and vehicle units artillery positions in the Tunisian theater day and night on Wednesday. Ten anti-Axis aircraft were shot down on the Tunisian front and in the area, and one German aircraft failed to return to base. Yesterday, anti-Axis intelligence stated that all fronts in Tunisia were very quiet on Thursday, but there was active reconnaissance activity in all areas. Medium bombers and light bomber squadrons also attacked the port of Sfax, but air force activity was hampered by poor weather on the front lines.</p>

<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Military sources announced last night that Soviet forces, who launched a local attack on the German bridgehead in Kuban, were repulsed by German forces yesterday and suffered heavy casualties. It is understood that the Soviet forces launched their main attack on the German positions east and north of the bridgehead. German artillery and air force dispersed the attacking Soviet forces. The Soviet supply base of Bataisk, south of Rostov, also suffered an effective attack.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to official sources last night, German forces, who were fiercely fighting south of Lake Ladoga, again repulsed repeated Soviet attacks on Thursday. The only major combat on the Eastern Front at present is in that area. The Soviet forces initially launched a fierce attack with artillery, followed by infantry assaults on the German lines several times, but the front of their attack was smaller than in the previous few days. All attacks were repulsed, and the Soviet forces failed to cross the positions in front of the German lines. German infantry units north of Lake Ilmen on the Volkhov front were particularly successful in operations against Soviet tank units. One infantry unit destroyed 68 Soviet tanks in the past few days, while another infantry unit destroyed 79 Soviet tanks in the past nine days. Further south, German forces launched local attacks in the areas west of Kursk and east of Sevsk, reoccupying many villages. Soviet forces in the central region are no longer using the tactic of separate attacks to test the strength of the shortened German lines. According to the military correspondent of the Havas News Agency, after the ground in the Kuban bridgehead area dries up, there may be large-scale war developments here in the near future. Although there are only local battles at present, even in the spring of last year, after a more severe winter, the climate of the Crimean Peninsula (where the climate is the same as that of the Kuban region) had allowed German forces to begin a large-scale offensive by mid-April and reassess the Kerch Peninsula. At the same time, the Soviet high command apparently also recognizes the German bridgehead around Novorossiysk as a dangerous German offensive base, so they are eager to eliminate this danger as soon as possible. The Soviet forces have concentrated around and north of Krasnodar in the past few days, seemingly preparing to launch a major attack in the near future, but the German high command is of course prepared for this. The orderly shortening of the lines by the German forces in the Kuban region has strengthened the German positions, and the undaunted fighting spirit of the German forces can be fully demonstrated by the heavy losses suffered by the Soviet forces in recent local attacks.</p>
<p>Moscow, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Soviet Information Bureau issued a special communiqué on the 2nd, stating that the winter counteroffensive ended on March 31st.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Ottawa, British Foreign Secretary Eden, after meeting with President Roosevelt in the United States, arrived in Ottawa on the 30th to exchange views with Canadian Prime Minister King on the issue of defending against Axis submarines. On the 2nd, Eden also gave a speech in the Canadian Parliament, pointing out the threat posed by Axis submarines to the anti-Axis powers, saying in essence that Axis submarines are indeed the greatest threat we currently face. We must not indulge in wishful thinking about this, and we must organize and actively research submarine defense technologies in the future. If there is any negligence, it will inevitably lead to great danger. We must not underestimate the strength of the Axis forces. Eden also mentioned his visit to the United States, saying that his previous talks with Soviet leaders, and this visit to the United States, can be said to be a continuation of the previous visit to the Soviet Union. The impressions given to him in these two meetings were extremely profound. After giving his speech, Eden continued to hold talks with Canadian government leaders. It is reported that the focus of the talks was on maritime transport and future political and economic issues.</p>

<h3 id="e23">European Atlantic Coast Defenses Extremely Strong; German Side Says Sufficient to Resist External Attacks <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a German announcement yesterday, the defensive wall along the European Atlantic coast is 2,700 kilometers long, 200 kilometers longer than the world-famous Great Wall of China. This figure only includes the defensive works along the English Channel and the Atlantic coast, and does not include the defensive works along the coasts of Denmark and Norway. Moreover, the Great Wall of China is only a single-line brick and earthwork, while the Atlantic Wall is winding and intricate, and is truly the latest modern defensive and offensive mechanism. During construction, careful calculations were made regarding the range of the artillery and the length of the transportation lines. All submarine bases, airplane landing fields, and roads, etc., are all in good order. According to experts, this is the world's greatest defense project, and it is sufficient to resist any external attack. One can be even more confident in view of the British attempt to land at Dieppe, which ultimately failed. It is recalled that at least 500,000 workers were employed in the construction of this project (not including workers in the industries supplying building materials and facilities), as well as thousands of huge construction machines, tens of thousands of various vehicles, 1,500 kilometers of narrow-gauge railways, and thousands of stations, all of which were temporarily installed. In one area, transportation vehicles traveled as many as 30,000 kilometers per day, while in another area, up to 3,000 tons of materials were unloaded per day. Each soldier stationed there is protected by 50 to 100 cubic meters of reinforced concrete. During construction, all forests were leveled, and the entire area was washed with water to complete it. The scale of the project is evident.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Internal Strife in the Anti-Axis Front and Prospects for the German Summer Offensive <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Imai – President Hitler's recent speech emphasized the upcoming spring offensive and also stated that the German army's mission in this war is to curb the expansion of communism and prevent it from invading Europe. So, what are the observations on the German-Soviet war?</p>
<p>Mogi – Both Germany and Britain see the German-Soviet war as the key to deciding this war. There are various opinions on whether Germany will launch a major offensive this year. Some believe that Germany is currently focusing on consolidating the so-called "Fortress Europe," so it is expected to take a defensive offensive and will not launch an offensive as large-scale as before. But even if its goal is really to establish "Fortress Europe," it will still have to launch a new offensive. After the total mobilization that is currently underway is completed, a large number of fresh troops can be obtained, so this is the final decisive battle against the Soviet Union. But this operation will be extremely cautious to prevent the British and Americans from taking advantage of the situation. President Hitler once again emphasized that Germany is the only dam against communism, which is a rather thorny argument from the perspective of Anglo-American dominance.</p>
<p>Imai – Yes, the Soviet Union, which aims to overthrow capitalism, forming a joint war front with the most capitalist countries, such a foolish political compromise does not exist on the Axis side.</p>
<p>Mogi – Now let's look at the situation on the German side?</p>
<p>Imai – President Hitler announced that the total number of German soldiers killed in action since the start of the war is 542,000. It is surprising that so few have been sacrificed in such fierce battles. Germany and the Soviet Union will both lay their lives on the line this year, meeting for the third time on the battlefield. What is the general assessment of the Soviet Union's war-fighting capabilities?</p>
<p>Mogi – Details are of course unknown, but the numbers generally reported are as follows:</p>
<p>In terms of food, last year's harvest, excluding feed, was 23 million tons, while the annual demand is 30 million tons. However, there is a considerable amount of storage, so food does not seem to be a problem in the next two years. In terms of oil, the Baku production is 24 million tons, transported by boat on the Volga River, but what the current situation is is a question. Areas outside the Caucasus produce 10 million tons, and there is also 10 million tons in storage, while the annual demand is 20 million tons, so it seems that supply can also meet demand. In terms of weapons production capacity, the monthly production is 1,300 aircraft and 1,200 tanks. The strength of the forces on the European front line is 6 million, 800,000 in the Far East, plus the border guards, totaling about 9 million. So the current mobilization capacity is 4 million to 5 million. From this perspective, the Soviet Union Germany can similarly lay their lives on the line this year. In this year's attack, regardless of whether the Soviet Union is subdued or not, in order to directly oppose Britain and the United States, the war against the Soviet Union cannot but seek an end. Therefore, this summer will be the peak of the German-Soviet war.</p>
<p>Imai – When the Soviet offensive continued, it prompted Britain and the United States to quickly open the first war front, but they ultimately lost this good opportunity. From a military point of view, if the Tunisian front cannot be consolidated, a second front is impossible. This situation remains unchanged to this day. Although the Eighth Army has already begun a general attack, it is reported that the British and Americans have a total of thirty divisions and forty aircraft in North Africa. While Rommel and Arnim's two Axis armies only have about ten divisions. The Axis armies have successfully prevented Britain and the United States from opening a second war front. But in these two or three months, Britain and the United States have been stepping up rear transport, sending some to the Tunisian front and others to the West Asian region. They seem to be eager to end the Tunisian front as soon as possible and start a second front from the eastern Mediterranean. The Axis forces are not willing to lag behind, and are preparing in a timely manner. (Xiang: Translated from the March 27th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun) (End)</p>
<h3 id="e25">Sino-Japanese Economic Symposium (2) Convened by *Continental News* and This Newspaper <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Date: 32nd year, 32nd day of March</p>
<p>Location: Sino-Japanese Club</p>
<p>Mr. Kurimoto: There is a saying in China, "No rain without clouds." Merchants are likened to clouds, and materials are likened to rain. Now, within the hope for material exchange, there is a belief that merchants who exploit China are unnecessary and should be eliminated; however, if merchants are eliminated, materials will likely not move. This point seems to need consideration. What does Mr. Li think? The status of merchants needs to be confirmed. It's like cause, condition, and effect – all three are indispensable. Just like a grain of rice placed on a carpet will never sprout into rice, it needs soil, water, and sunlight to bear fruit in autumn. Similarly, for the exchange of materials, merchants are indeed an indispensable and important component.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Quanshi: That's correct, but in this era of control, seeking exorbitant profits is not allowed; if one is satisfied with appropriate profits, then merchants naturally have a need to exist.</p>
<p>Mr. Yao Qingsan: I have continuously advocated for measures to ease the movement of materials and for the establishment of a national commercial control association since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. I am extremely pleased to see these measures being implemented now, beyond words. First, regarding the national commercial control association, the Japanese authorities' transfer of material control rights to China is a wise move, and it is indeed only when managed by the Chinese themselves that the cooperation of the people can be obtained. The most important point here is the spirit of mutual understanding, and the foundation of mutual understanding is equality and fairness. In the future, all control measures should be implemented comprehensively, regardless of nationality. There should be no favoritism towards Chinese merchants, nor favoritism towards Japanese merchants; moreover, impartiality is needed to win sympathy. Secondly, regarding the measures to ease the movement of materials, I believe that unnecessary controls should be removed. For commodities where the government can control the source of supply and implement rationing on the consumption side, control should be imposed. As for other commodities, it would be better to allow free buying and selling, because having only price controls without rationing will only reduce the effective supply in the market, making it difficult to meet consumer needs. The flow of currency will inevitably encourage hoarding and fuel the black market. Past experience should serve as a guide for us in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Takeuchi: The price problem is best regarded as the ultimate crystallization of economic problems. If we conduct a comprehensive review of this price problem, we will naturally understand the direction of future economic policies. Moreover, the fundamental problem of people's livelihood and future economic operations is also a very important issue. Regarding this problem, I would like to ask Mr. Kiuchi to express his overall opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. Kiuchi: The price problem is indeed the most difficult. As Mr. Takeuchi suggested, it is a combination of political and economic phenomena. Currently, prices are rising at a very rapid pace, and people believe that this rise has almost no hope of stopping. However, I am not so pessimistic about this point. Why? Because the main reason for the rise in prices is the restriction on the exchange of materials. As a result of this new policy, if the restriction on the exchange of materials can be lifted – it goes without saying that it cannot be completely lifted, but even if it is mostly lifted – then the biggest cause of price increases will be eliminated. In this sense, this time, the lifting of the existing movement restrictions depends on the success of the Chinese side's autonomous control organization – the success of the activities of the autonomous control organization in the private sector. In this sense, if the private, autonomous commercial organization to be established this time is successful, then under this condition, the price problem will be largely resolved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the current rise in prices, there are very different opinions. Some believe that it is due to the difficulty in maintaining the value of reserve certificates. For example, the recent rise in prices is attributed to very unfavorable rumors about the Axis powers' situation in the German-Soviet war and the North African war. Regarding this point, it is absolutely certain that the Axis powers can achieve final victory; the view that the Axis powers are at a disadvantage is clearly a mistaken understanding. Moreover, the public's speculation about the amount of reserve certificates issued is far greater than the actual figures. This is also an extremely wrong perception, poisoned by rumors and gossip.</p>
<p>The above are the reasons why I believe there is no need to be pessimistic about the future of prices. Now, let me briefly express my humble opinion on how the future control policies should be implemented.</p>
<p>In what direction should future price policies proceed? As Mr. Yao mentioned earlier, control should only be exercised over the materials that the controllers have in their grasp, and for the rest, they should be largely allowed to be free. This is the general direction. The materials that the controllers have in their grasp are, needless to say, rice imported from the south, cotton yarn and cotton cloth from Shanghai, as well as cigarettes and matches, etc., which can be used as so-called materials for granting certificates. These can be regarded as materials in the grasp of the controllers. The prices of these materials in the grasp of the controllers should be maintained at a low level and, as Mr. Li initially said, exchanged for production materials in the interior. If these two things can be done in this direction, it will largely be enough to establish the economic foundation of Shanghai. As for other materials, it is generally okay to allow them to be free. This so-called allowing them to be free, according to the current understanding, seems to make prices rise even further; but if we recognize that freedom means exchange, then in reality, we can expect the result of maintaining price levels. This is a very ordinary view and no different from what you all often say.</p>
<p>Mr. Takeuchi: Mr. Pan, please—</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Yangyao: (1) After the transformation of Japan's new policy towards China, it is hoped that the Japanese side will respect the convenience of Chinese merchants having free trade within the framework. The mutual exchange of agricultural products from the interior and manufactured goods from Shanghai should be facilitated to achieve free and smooth material exchange. Unnecessary restrictions and extremely cumbersome procedures in the past should be eliminated from now on, so that the difficulties faced by merchants can be avoided from now on. All monopolistic, encroaching, and profiteering behaviors of intermediaries will also not arise. If this can be done, then manufacturers can safely manufacture and step up production, and trading merchants can also assess the needs and supplies of the local area and various provinces and cities, and move goods from where there is surplus to where there is a shortage, in order to balance prices and stabilize the market. This is what we deeply hope the authorities will pay close attention to and realize. At the same time, we hope that Chinese and Japanese merchants will each strive for the balanced development of each other's businesses on an equal trading footing, so that Shanghai, the economic center, can easily change its past situation and gradually move towards prosperity.</p>
<p>(2) The biggest problem with current prices is that those who have goods are unwilling to sell them, while those who have no goods are desperately buying them. Factories, with the cost of raw materials they have stored increasing daily, would rather hoard raw materials to wait for a good price. Even if they manufacture finished products, considering the price limits set by the authorities, there is a loss without profit, so they would rather hoard finished products to wait for a good price. As a result, those seeking goods have no way to buy them and have no choice but to secretly pay high prices in the black market to seek goods, thus creating black market prices. Therefore, if we want to eliminate the black market today, the first thing to do is to seek a sufficient source of raw materials. At the same time, for foreign raw materials, we should seek the invention of substitutes. Secondly, price limits should be relaxed to give those who have goods a chance to sell them. For example, 20-count cotton yarn has an official price of 5,500 yuan, but many cloth factories have no way to buy it. Seeking it in the black market is even more afraid of breaking the law, so they have no choice but to stop or reduce work, and cloth becomes less and less, and cloth merchants naturally become more speculative. As a result, it is said that "the more prices are limited, the higher the black market prices become." How painful these words are! Therefore, in the current era of stepping up wartime production, smoothing the source and increasing production is a fundamental solution, but relaxing price limits to make those who have goods willing to sell them is a way to eliminate the black market. Some say that if price limits are relaxed, black market prices will be even higher. In fact, if the official price is already relaxed, who would be willing to be speculative again? It is an unnecessary worry. However, when setting official prices, it is necessary to make precise calculations using scientific methods based on the cost of raw materials, workers' food and wages, and all actual expenses, and do so in a completely fair and impartial manner, then all problems will naturally be solved easily.</p>
<p>(3) Reviving Shanghai factories is impossible at present. Maintaining the remaining factories already feels extremely difficult. Why? Because transportation is difficult, procedures are cumbersome, the source of raw materials in the interior is already felt to be not easy, and the outlet for finished products, in addition to being absorbed by hoarders, is also felt to be very difficult. This is one reason. Electricity is subject to restrictions, this is another reason. Workers' food is not easy to obtain, this is yet another reason. The difference between the cost of finished products and the price limits is too great, this is yet one more reason. The survival of a factory depends on raw materials and finished products. In other words, the way in and the way out. Now that both the way in and the way out are exhausted, how can we expect to revive it? There is no other way but to seek to increase production within the minimum limit. We hope that the agricultural and sideline product raw materials that we rely on from the interior can be transported in steadily in the future through the sound transportation system and the simple transportation methods, so that the finished products produced can also be gradually transported to the interior to realize the purpose of material exchange between inside and outside. At the same time, we should improve machinery and equipment, recruit technical personnel, and adopt factory rationalization to achieve the greatest efficiency with the least amount of time, manpower, and economy. Then, with lower costs and more products, Shanghai, the industrial center of China, may be able to take the first step in increasing production before talking about reviving industry, so that it will not be just empty talk.</p>
<p>(4) Although Chinese factories have not yet escaped the stage of immaturity, after years of hard work, their machinery and equipment, technical improvements, and excellent products have been unanimously recognized by people at home and abroad. In particular, many old factories, with their rich reserves of raw materials, good reputation, and huge assets, at a time of soaring prices, it is only natural that their stocks are being snapped up. Moreover, Chinese stock trading is also the foundation for promoting the Chinese capital market. Since the trading is legitimate, it is not without its benefits in increasing the amount of funds for production and promoting the development of Chinese industry. This kind of normal trading is naturally beyond reproach. However, with too many stock companies being established, there may inevitably be competitive trading. If it is purely spot trading, based on fixed assets, and considering future trends, determining a compromise and appropriate stock price is also beyond reproach. Recalling the past Chinese Stock Exchange, it only traded public bonds, which has long been suspended, and it does not trade Chinese stocks at ordinary times, so there is no direct relationship with Chinese factories and there is a lot of estrangement. The foreign merchants' General Chamber of Commerce has also been suspended for a long time. In the future, if we want to create a formal market for legitimate trading, we should start with reviving the Chinese Stock Exchange, consult sincerely with the original personnel and the leaders of the Chinese stock industry, and organize its establishment as soon as possible to specialize in the trading of Chinese stocks. With a legal organization and legitimate trading, the long-standing problem of the Chinese stock industry will naturally be completely solved. (5) This time, the Japanese government and the public resolutely implemented the relaxation of material movement restrictions and trusted Chinese merchants to automatically organize the National Commercial Control Association, which has been unanimously admired by all parties, who believe that this policy change has indeed given Chinese industry and commerce a glimmer of hope for a turnaround. However, the success of this association carries a great responsibility and a arduous mission. It must strive to do its work with a fair and frank attitude, without selfishness and without considering personal relationships. All cadres and personnel in various departments must be honest and self-disciplined, work wholeheartedly and earnestly to serve the legitimate industrial and commercial circles, and make this arduous task proceed smoothly to live up to the expectations of all parties. Regarding the procedures for material movement, we should not only seek to be strict, but also seek to be simple and efficient. Regarding the results of the review, we should not only seek to be detailed, but also seek to be fair. We hope that for the movement of materials inside and outside the urban area, we should not only entrust the trade association to be responsible for reporting, but also add multi-faceted spot checks and secret investigations, so that those who take advantage of opportunities to cheat or violate laws and regulations to apply their tricks will be deterred. Then, after a year and a half, we may be able to see some results. It depends on whether those in charge can work hard and whether they have the perseverance and determination.</p>
<p>Mr. Kurimoto: Then, regarding the general price problem, the gentlemen have already spoken very thoroughly. This is a very difficult problem, and we can always say more. Now, I want to move away from theory and talk about practical issues. In the past, when silver existed – when there was so-called safe existence of hard currency – the view of goods was that as long as there was money, anything could be bought. Now, it has changed in the opposite direction, with the psychological state of thinking that as long as there are goods, any amount of money can be exchanged for them. Is it not necessary to restore this general view to the original psychological state of thinking that as long as there is money, anything can be bought? Then, what method should be used? It goes without saying that it is to put goods in a state of sufficient circulation so that what is needed can generally be bought. However, the current state is not such that anything needed can be bought. The idea that stabilizing the faith in currency requires making goods abundant to stabilize prices is difficult to implement.</p>
<p>Therefore, even though there are not many goods here, what is still enough to reassure the general public is the relaxation of material movement restrictions that has been announced this time. At the same time, the fact that the restricted affairs, which were previously executed by the government, are now being managed by the private organization National Commercial Control Association, is it not giving a huge sense of reassurance to the general public? Therefore, the responsibility of this so-called National Commercial Control Association is very heavy. If the exercise of its powers is flawed, the drawbacks will also be great. It may be a bit laughable (laughs) to say that this association can make the few goods more abundant, but it must be understood that saying that is simply a propaganda method to stabilize people's hearts. Finally, I want to reiterate that if we want the control to be carried out very smoothly, we must use the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors in a very proper and impartial manner.</p>

<h3 id="e26">After Reducing Tram Stops, the Number of Trips Has Increased, Passengers Are Still Extremely Crowded, Authorities Try to Prevent Accidents <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from the *Datong News Agency* to the Shanghai Tram Company, the Tram Company has implemented measures to reduce stops and designate express trams to increase the speed of the vehicles and the number of round trips in order to reduce crowding.</p>
<p>Increased Number of Tickets Sold</p>
<p>The situation in recent days has proven that this measure is indeed effective. According to accurate statistics, the number of trips made by each tram per day has increased by two to four times. Although the crowding phenomenon has not decreased significantly in reality, the number of tickets sold each day has increased.</p>
<p>Preventing Fraudulent Ticket Sales</p>
<p>At the same time, the company has recently implemented the following measures to prevent ticket vendors from committing fraud: (1) Adding plainclothes ticket inspectors to detect fraudulent behavior that is not easy to prevent when selling tickets; (2) Rewarding ticket inspectors for reporting fraud; (3) Encouraging passengers to purchase monthly and seasonal passes and providing various conveniences to those who purchase tickets as much as possible.</p>
<p>Continued Cooperation to Eliminate Pickpockets</p>
<p>The tram authorities are deeply concerned about the danger of accidents due to the current crowding situation, so they have dispatched a large number of route inspectors to each major station to guide passengers at any time. Finally, it is learned that the tram company authorities will continue to cooperate fully with the police department's planned second campaign to eliminate pickpockets, which will begin on the 12th.</p>
<p>Signs Posted at Stops Not Served</p>
<p>Since the operation of express trams began, ten unnecessary stops have been eliminated. In recent days, some passengers have not been aware of this and have felt inconvenience. It is learned that the tram company has added signs to the abolished stops on the utility poles of the eliminated stops and posted slogans at the stops not served by express trams since yesterday (the 3rd) to draw the attention of the general public.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Loving Our Own Children and Extending That Love to the Children of Others: A Quick Sketch of the Children's Welfare Symposium <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Today is the 12th annual Children's Day. Before this day, shops in Shanghai generally adorned their display windows with colorful children's toys, allowing fortunate people to bring their fortunate children to purchase them. Various elementary schools are also preparing programs to celebrate Children's Day. However, we can also see countless children wandering the streets, unable to get two meals a day and unable to find a place to sleep at night.</p>
<p>They also have Children's Day, but Children's Day does not bring them happiness, joy, or education. Of course, there is no question of making them understand their responsibilities as children. All they enjoy is hunger, cold, suffering, and the relentless oppression of a harsh environment.</p>
<p>Prices are rising day by day. The more than thirty relief organizations that originally existed in Shanghai not only lack the capacity to take in new child refugees but are also on the verge of being unable to maintain their existing educational facilities!</p>
<p>This newspaper has long recognized that the problem of child refugees is a serious social issue looming before us. Therefore, two months ago, we appealed for schools for child refugees and suggested sending them to the countryside. On April 3rd—the day before Children's Day—from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM, we held a Children's Welfare Symposium at the academic lecture hall of the Majestic Hotel, inviting well-known figures who have always been enthusiastic about the problem of child refugees and practitioners from child refugee education organizations. The issues discussed included: (1) fundraising for child refugees, (2) procurement of food for child refugees, (3) nutrition and hygiene for child refugees, (4) teaching materials and textbooks for child refugees, (5) labor and production for child refugees, (6) character training for child refugees, (7) improvement of education for child refugees, (8) self-reliance and future prospects for child refugees, (9) child refugee education work, (10) rural life for child refugees, (11) cooperation among child refugee education organizations, and (12) emergency relief for street children to commemorate this year's Children's Day. At 4:00 PM sharp, people from all walks of life who were attending the symposium arrived one after another. There were more than 30 people, including Dr. Zu Yin, Director of the Shanghai Children's Library, Ms. Qiu Liying, General Secretary of the Young Women's Christian Association, and Dr. Chen Qingshi, Chairman of the Board of the Youyou Educational Institute. First, Mr. Huang Jingwan of the Social Service Department of this newspaper reported on the significance of convening the symposium. The general idea was: Today is the day before Children's Day, and this newspaper is holding a special Children's Welfare Symposium in commemoration. Currently, prices are high, and child refugees are living in misery. This newspaper has always been very concerned about child refugee education, so we have specially invited you gentlemen to express your opinions on the discussion topics. We also hope that from now on, child refugee education organizations will help and unite with each other to benefit the child refugees who have already been taken in and educated and the street child refugees who are waiting to be taken in. Then, Dr. Hu Zuyin expressed his views on the issue of cooperation among child refugee education institutions, dividing it into negative and positive aspects. Next, Chen Qingshi, Chairman of Youyou Institute, Ding Bingnan, General Secretary of the China Children's Welfare Association, Chen Yisheng, Chairman of the Juvenile Affairs Committee of the Youth Association, Ding Fulao, Director of Fuyou Institute and child nutrition expert, Wang Hefeng, Director of Tushanwan Orphanage, Li Ruihua, Director of the Children's Care Institute, Chen Zhengfan, Director of the Child Refugee Education Center, Zhong Zhigang, Director of the Shanghai Poor Children's Home, Ruan Bin, Director of the Youyou Educational Institute, Yang, Section Chief of the Shanghai Social Welfare Bureau, and others, either academically or based on practical experience, contributed their opinions on the mutual assistance and cooperation of Shanghai's charitable organizations and the promotion of child refugee education in the future. These were all extremely valuable materials, sufficient for reference for those who care about and are engaged in child refugee education. The meeting was adjourned at 7:30 PM. Detailed records of this symposium will be published separately once they have been compiled. (Jiamu)</p>

<p>Dr. Kotaro Tanaka, a renowned Japanese scholar, and Professor Takeo Suzuki arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper, held a tea party at the Carlton Hotel yesterday afternoon to welcome them. Attendees included Consul Tanaka and Consul Iwai from friendly nations, as well as Chinese figures such as Wen Xiongbai, Liu Yusheng, Xia Jiancheng, Gao Chuiwan, Tao Kangde, Guo Zongxian, Yang Guangzheng, and business leaders such as Li Quanshi, Jin Zongcheng, Yao Qingsan, Xu Xiaochu, Zhao Jinqing, and Wen Zhating (listed in order of stroke count of their surnames).</p>
<p>Chen Binhe Delivered a Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stating: "The significance of today's tea party is to welcome Dr. Tanaka and Professor Suzuki to China. Dr. Tanaka is not only a legal authority in Japan but also a world-renowned scholar. The purpose of his visit to China is to study Chinese commercial customs and to promote Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. Today, I am introducing him to all of you. I am very grateful for your participation despite your busy schedules. The oldest person present is Mr. Wen Lanting, who is 74 years old this year, and the youngest is Mr. Liu Yusheng, who is 26 years old this year. People like Mr. Xia Jiancheng, a senior figure in education, and Mr. Gao Chuiwan, a poet, rarely attend any gatherings, so it is even more gratifying that they have come today to meet Dr. Tanaka."</p>
<p>Dr. Tanaka Delivered a Speech</p>
<p>"We are deeply honored that Mr. Chen Binhe, the president of Shen Bao, with his glorious history, and his brilliant experience in the cultural and political fields, has kindly invited us to this gathering, introducing us to distinguished figures in the cultural and economic circles of your country, and showering us with sincere and generous words of introduction. We are sincerely grateful to Mr. Chen for his kindness. We also express our deep gratitude to Consul Iwai for his great care. Recently, many of our compatriots have visited your country, but it is rare for us to be able to interact so intimately with distinguished figures in your country. We will never forget the hospitality we have received from all of you today, and we are eager to convey this kindness to the enlightened classes in Japan.</p>
<p>The so-called Sino-Japanese friendship has always been advocated by our compatriots, but to ensure that this advocacy does not remain a mere empty slogan, we believe that the people of both countries must exert all their political, economic, and cultural efforts. Therefore, love between the people of both countries is necessary. And for the sake of love, respect is necessary. And for the sake of respect, knowledge is necessary. Knowledge breeds respect, and respect further develops into love. Only in this way can true friendship be achieved. Therefore, knowledge is fundamental. However, knowledge is not easy. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said that knowing is difficult, and doing is easy. Indeed, it is easy to act without knowing, but nothing is more disastrous than this.</p>
<p>But does such 'knowledge' truly exist sufficiently between our two peoples now? Regarding this point, we do not blame each other for ignorance but believe that we must reflect on our own ignorance. The so-called 'to know when you do not know is wisdom' means this. The enlightened leaders of your country must be reflecting with humility, believing that they must understand Japan even better. We Japanese believe that you, with the numerous students who have studied in Japan since the Meiji era, and with books, must know Japan fairly well—at least about modern Japan. We Japanese, although we have been quite close to your country's classical culture since ancient times, must generally humbly admit that our understanding of modern China is very insufficient. Like myself, I am undoubtedly one of them. However, in this regard, it is necessary to consider that Japan's understanding of your country, generally speaking, is several times more difficult than your understanding of Japan—Japan's inherent national polity aside. Your country has a long history of more than four thousand years, and its territory is dozens of times larger than Japan, and each region has its own local characteristics, with different languages, customs, and economies. Moreover, in the social strata, the range is very wide, and the separation between the upper and lower classes is great. Therefore, even if we pride ourselves on knowing your country, we often cannot avoid the feeling of 'blind men touching an elephant.' Therefore, the efforts of us Japanese to understand your country must be far greater than the efforts of you to understand Japan. Fortunately, in the past ten years, in Japan, there has been a surge of enthusiasm for the study of your country's politics, economy, history, and culture, and that is entirely detached from political intentions, purely out of a passion for seeking truth. Such concern and interest in your country's culture has gradually become beneficial research and has yielded results, and it is about to contribute to the strengthening of ties between the two countries. Now, the situation in the world and East Asia is demanding that the union between our two countries be consolidated, especially the maintenance of order in East Asia is placed on the shoulders of our two countries. However, the political cooperation between the two countries must have material and spiritual elements as necessary conditions, that is, economy and culture. The economy is the body, and the idealism that regards it as insignificant must be rejected; culture is the spirit, and the materialism that regards it as insignificant cannot be sided with. We must guarantee political cooperation through economic and cultural cooperation; otherwise, political cooperation cannot be strengthened. Fortunately, the relationship between our Japan and your country, economic and cultural, or mutual, exchanging their unique products, and thereby collaborating for the same purpose, the material and spiritual foundation, also exists in a natural and historical sense. Even from our decades of research on your country's commercial legal system, we can know this. In particular, the study of your country's commercial customs for the past four years, such as trade associations, the training of commercial personnel, partnerships, brokerage firms, and other systems, as well as the merchant morality that attaches great importance to credit, has shown that it is dominated by a familial order that is different from modern European and Westernized Japanese commercial systems, and by an economic ethics of cooperative systems, and that it is by no means an unreasonable retreat but a very reasonable advance, indicating the strong and vibrant life of your country's nation. As a result, we have gained many inspirations in scholarship, and from this, we have developed a deep respect and love for your country. That is indeed a powerful attempt to introduce national society into the individualism of capitalism, which endangers division.</p>
<p>I am embarrassed to say much more; however, every people in the world has its strengths and weaknesses. We should, like individual self-cultivation, honestly see our own shortcomings for the nation; at the same time, we must acknowledge and praise the strengths of others; otherwise, the various nations cannot merge and cannot improve. We believe that we should adopt such an attitude toward others: we must acknowledge the strengths of others as their essence and not remember their shortcomings. In any era, in any country, it is not determined by a rogue or a lazy person. We must be true to others and judge them in their ideal state. We are focusing on how only the highest ideals and true goals of your country can correctly understand your country and evaluate your country.</p>
<p>We are very pleased to become acquainted with you today, who stand at the peak of the economic and cultural circles of your country, and from this opportunity, to deeply experience knowing, respecting, and loving your country. I have taken up much of your time, and I apologize for troubling you with my words. I also thank you for today's hospitality."</p>
<p>Liu Yusheng Spoke</p>
<p>"I deeply agree with Dr. Tanaka's great remarks just now. The Doctor said: The Japanese people's understanding of China cannot be regarded as fixed by what is currently understood, and there is more to be studied further. I deeply believe that this is the case, and the Chinese people's lack of understanding of Japan is also the same. We must also conduct further research on the situation in Japan in order to achieve true friendship. Sino-Japanese friendship did not begin today; since ancient times, we have been called 'brotherly countries.' Although there are those who study Japanese issues recently, it is still not enough. The ancient saying goes, 'Do not worry that others do not know me; worry that I do not know others.' I hope that the people of China and Japan will share this meaning, intensify their research, and live up to the great expectations of Dr. Tanaka and Professor Suzuki."</p>
<p>Yao Qingsan Spoke</p>
<p>"I am deeply moved by Dr. Tanaka's frank understanding and recognition of the Sino-Japanese situation. The unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident would not have occurred if this principle had been followed. At the time, the Chinese people's opinion was that Japan's economy would collapse after three years of war. If the Chongqing government had understood that Japan could support six years of war and could fight and win against Britain and the United States, it might not have dragged on the war. And in Japan, some people initially lacked understanding of China, which led to mutual miscalculations and contributed to the incident. This is deeply regrettable. To correct and remedy this, we can only rely on sincere cooperation between the two sides. After the Sino-Japanese Incident and before the establishment of the Nanjing government, I felt that China and Japan were brotherly countries and should advocate two types of cooperation as soon as possible: (1) friendship with Japan and (2) skepticism about peace with Japan. Regarding the latter, it is not possible to change their attitude by force. I hope that there will be facts of friendship to combine China's independence and revival so that the general concept of suspicion of peace can be corrected. Recently, after Japan changed its policy toward China, the Chinese people have had a good response. If we can do what Dr. Tanaka said, I firmly believe that the Chinese people will be able to achieve true cooperation."</p>

<p>The Nanjing Branch of the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has been actively carrying out inspection work since its establishment. It is understood that in order to understand the business situation of various financial institutions, the branch has sent letters to various banks, silver shops, and money exchanges, requesting them to prepare a classified combined table of various deposit items, together with the monthly accounting table for March, and submit them to the branch before April 5.

<h3 id="e36">Commentary: Conditions for a Controlled Economy <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>China's economy is now moving towards a controlled economy. We sincerely hope that China's construction of a controlled economy will be successful and used successfully. Holding this hope, we cannot but point out some problems and expect that appropriate measures will be taken.</p>
<p>The first condition for the success of economic control is to rectify the national institutions. Economic control requires the establishment of a certain plan, distributing this plan to the economic sector for compliance, and at the same time monitoring its implementation. In order for the country to achieve this, it must first have a strong force in investigating the economic situation and setting plans. In order to supervise the economic sector, monitor whether there are any violations, and deal with those who violate the regulations, there must first be sound administrative institutions and incorruptible officials. As long as we recall the economic control situations in Japan and Germany, we will understand this. But what is the current situation in China? Using the standards of Japan and Germany to measure it, it is too far apart! There are many places that should be improved, and this is undeniable.</p>
<p>The construction and operation of a controlled economy is not enough to rely on government guidance; the people must automatically rise up and cooperate. This can be said to be the second condition. The way to realize this second condition is to promote patriotism and reorganize the people. Speaking of this, we must again bring up the examples of Japan and Germany. Leaving Japan aside for the moment, let's talk about Germany. The Nazi Party, as the nervous system of the national organization, made such a great contribution to maintaining the work between the government and the people. It is not necessary to say it clearly, and everyone knows it. Promoting war consciousness and strengthening party organization are urgent priorities for China after the war, and also necessary requirements for promoting a controlled economy.</p>
<p>In the case of implementing a controlled economy, a country's economy must be developed to the highest degree. This can be said to be the third condition. In this stage of development, the main sectors of industry often have already monopolized enterprises or a few large enterprises. In other words, this is the result of the development of the economic sector itself, which has already been organized, so economic control with this as the target is extremely easy. Japan, Germany, Britain, and the United States all have good examples of this. Looking back at the current situation in China, we have to admit that it is too far apart.</p>
<p>The character of China's controlled economy is not yet clearly expressed, but private autonomous control has a great effect. This is the reality of China, and it is also the only possible method. To achieve the desired goal by such a difficult method, both the government and the private sector need to make redoubled efforts. Regardless of how much effort is made, in short, it is more important than anything else to deeply reflect on the above conditions. (Yun Peng: Translated from the Dalu Xinbao on April 1)</p>

On the industry side, there were approximately 80 people, including Lu Wenshao, Jiang Shizhi, Chen Ziyi, Fu Qiangeng, Xie Meisheng, Zhang Dalian, Xue Meiting, Jiang Yachen, and Huang Yantang. During the banquet, Minister Gu gave a speech, the original words of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Food Control Managed by the Chinese</p>
<p>Before the incident, food management had no organization, no control, and was entirely a free economic situation. After the incident, the Japanese side began to control food for military needs. After weighing the options, the food control matters were handed over to the Chinese side to manage, and the Food Committee was established. At that time, rice prices increased, and various controls were difficult to develop. Moreover, the rice category was divided into military rice and civilian rice. In the rice-producing areas of Central China, a part was designated as a military rice area, and another part was designated as a civilian rice area. Within the civilian rice area, rice transfers were limited, and a purchase permit was required within a certain section. If it was moved outside the designated area, a passport was required. The purpose was to suppress rice prices, but in fact, the rice price in one place often changed with the rise and fall of rice prices elsewhere, so the authorities' goal could not be fully achieved. In the military rice area, a part of the rice produced was used locally, and the remainder was used as military rice.</p>
<p>Establishing Joint Operations to Protect the Market</p>
<p>After taking over as Chairman of the Food Committee last year, I immediately began to organize joint operations so that merchants in various related industries could be fully active, and at the same time, it would also benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. This system was first promoted in Danyang, Jintan, and Nanjing, with good results, and it will be carried out according to this policy in the future. Joint rice and grain operations are established in various places to purchase rice and grain and then sell it to the Central Rice and Grain Production and Sales General Administration. This office will be changed to the "Central Grain Storage Bureau" within one or two months. However, transactions can be made between joint operations. This will protect the legitimate interests of rice and grain merchants and will definitely make a contribution. However, hoarding and manipulation can be eliminated. The Ministry of Food will assess the business connections of the rice and grain joint operations in various cities and counties, divide them into several districts, and the Ministry will appoint district supervisors to manage them. That is, in the area of each rice and grain joint operation, no merchant may independently engage in business of the same nature as the joint operation.</p>
<p>Separate Public Associations for Coarse Grains and Other Industries</p>
<p>After the Food Committee was changed to the Ministry of Food, the food under its jurisdiction included rice, wheat, coarse grains, cotton, livestock, condiments (sugar, oil, alcohol, vinegar, sauce, etc.), canned foods, and beverages (soda, tea, etc.). However, recently the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Public Associations for Industry and Commerce. Except for rice, which is not subject to the control of the Council for Unified Commerce, the other items under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Food must be established as public associations separately. Therefore, in the future, the rice category will be regulated by the Rice and Grain Production and Sales General Administration through rice joint operations. Other categories such as coarse grains, oil, sugar, alcohol, and tea will be organized into public associations separately. Public associations of the same nature in various places will then be gathered in Shanghai to become joint associations of various industries, which will be managed by the National Council for Unified Commerce. Generally speaking, in terms of the system, except for rice and grain in the food industry, one county or several counties in one district will set up a public association, and the personnel allocation will be jointly decided by the Ministry of Food, the Food Bureau, and the related industries. Those who do not participate in the public association may not engage in the buying and selling of the public association's items. The public association will be divided into groups to handle matters, and shops may participate in one or several groups depending on their business category, participate in one public association or several public associations. There will also be supervisors in the public association, whose job is to liaise.</p>
<p>Everything Must Focus on the National Economy and People's Livelihood</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Council for Unified Commerce, various industries can completely freely transport materials. In fact, this is not the case. The transfer of materials will not be as complicated as in the past, but there are still many steps that must be paid attention to. If a shop needs to transfer materials from location A to location B, it must first submit it to the related industry public association, the public association must submit it to the joint association, and the joint association must apply to the National Council for Unified Commerce. Above the Council for Unified Commerce, there is another related coordinating body. If this process can be followed through, the transfer will be no problem. Otherwise, acting rashly will definitely encounter difficulties. I am straightforward by nature, and I will say everything I know without holding back. I hope that the food industries can understand the current control system, the rice and grain industry will follow the legal requirements to form joint operations, and the coarse grain and other industries will quickly rectify the organization of the trade association. Then, based on the public associations in various places, form a joint association of various industries in Shanghai from the three provinces and two cities. In this way, the wartime food policy can be realized, the efficiency of control can be strengthened, and the threat to the people's food can be eliminated. In these difficult times, everything must focus on the national economy and the people's livelihood. I am willing to encourage this with you all.</p>
