<p>社評</p>
<h3>論「公」與「私」</h3>
<p>「公」與「私」二字及其含義，似乎很容易識得懂得，很普遍的為一般人所認識，尤其是「知識階級」不必多加辭費的去解釋。然而，有兩個原因，使這本來很易認識的「公」與「私」，反而模糊起來了。第一，宇宙間一切事物，一切風習，惟其太尋常習見了，就很易忘其本來面目。「公」與「私」因為太尋常習見了，所以也不能例外的被人忘其面目，而模糊起來。第二，自私是人類的天性（也可以說一般動物），因此，「藉公濟私「，「以私害公」，「公私不分」等等現象普遍形成而模糊起來。所以，「公」與「私」二字及其含義，普遍的為人所認識，確是事實；而普遍的為人所漠視與模糊，也確是事實。</p>
<p>如就政府機關而言，服務的職工，一槪稱為公務人員，大部分為知識階級，對於「公」與「私」的含義與界域，當然非常明白，可是，我們如果細加考察？大部分機關，大部分公務員部犯着漠視「公」「私」的界域而模糊的弊病。因為職權的不同，模糊的程度，也有不同，而其模糊却是同樣的。譬如說用人，則引用親戚，同鄉，故舊，比較純粹為事擇人而公開甄選的觀念總是來得深，尤其是重要職位，不肯輕易付諸非自己系統的人擔任。祇以保持個人的地位穩固與運用個人的指揮便利為重，而視事業的成功為輕，道也就是公私不明。不過，我們并非祗說其一，不顧其二。對於川人，因為親戚，同鄉，故舊是比較淸楚其品性與能力，比較可以信任，祗要確實能力與職位相稱，適人適事，其辦事成績為大家所承認，這樣，原則上自然無可訾議。如果不問其適人適事，能力與職位相稱，祗須親戚同鄉故舊，盡人可用，盡事可辦，結果弊病也為大家所承認，這樣，顯然是公私不明。所以，我們對於「任用私人」的結論，如果說親戚同鄉故舊是私人，不問其品性才能如何，而絕對不可任用，當然非持平之論。如果以親戚同鄉故舊為夾袋中人，不問其品性才能如何，而絕對盲目引進，當然是任用私人。用人的目的，完全在於為公家辦事，衡量共品性才能，予以適常職務；衡量職務所需的品性與才能，任用適常人員，使之勝任愉快，成績美滿。符合此一前提條件，縱引用者是親戚同鄉故舊，亦非「任用私人」。用人的目的，完全在於便利私圖，乃以親戚同鄉故舊為心腹為爪牙，完成共私圖，這顯然是「任用私人」了。這樣，我們可以用此尺度，衡量當今政府機關當局是否任用私人？是否公私不明？</p>
<p>其次，就用錢而言，公私之問，事實上更易分出界限，而往往為一般操有權職者所模糊。因而帳面上的花樣，比較可以變化，且係內部分的事，外問不易洞悉，不若用人的顯明。因此，我們主張，凡是管理帳務的人，不用親戚同鄉故舊負責，雖其品性與才能相稱，為表示迴避嫌疑起見，也以避免為是。至於各級公務人員，即無用人用錢的職權者，也應當注意公私之間的分明，譬如言時間，則遵守辦公時間，不遲到，不早退，不在辦公時間內辦理私事。言公物，不以私事動用公物，不以公物佔為私有，踨一紙一筆之微，也不忽略，同時，即因公事使用公物也應如使用私物同樣的加以愛護與撙節。</p>
<p>上面所說的，是關於公私之間一般的界域，政府機關如此，即公共團體以至工商組織也莫不如此。</p>
<p>同時，我們更就目前中日雙方機關團體之間，對於公私之分，也可以引用上面所說的意義，加以衡斷。譬如中日機關團體之間，對於公務上的接觸與商決，就中國人士而言，很多採用先私後公的方式，首先重視私人關係的聯絡交好，請客送禮，再接再厲，而置公務的成績於不顧，似乎以聯絡交好為手段，誤認祗須私人關係聯絡密切後，公務成績可不必注意，一定會水到渠成。其實，這是完全錯誤的。老實說，日本人士並不是紈袴子弟，不可能以私人關係交好後可以隨便影響公務的。其結果不但聯絡交好失敗，並予人以不良印象，反是影響以後公務上的折衝。所以，我們主張不能先私後公，應該先公後私，先在公務上折　洽當，互相了解互相認識，然後聯絡私交，更趨密切。應以公務上折衝洽常為基礎，而後聯絡私人交誼，則其交誼是為公，是先公後私，交誼愈密切，折衝愈圓滑，結果愈有益。如以私人聯絡交誼為共礎，而不注重於公務成績，則共交誼為私，是先私後公，交誼縱密切，折衝仍難見有利。</p>
<p>其次，就日本方面而言，也不無公私不明之例。譬如對於某一中國人，主觀上認為深有交情者，就不問其人客觀上的品格能力如何，就盡保護之責。因而很可能被藉為護符，而益發助長私圖，公衆受其影響。這是公私不明的遺患。</p>
<p>總之，我們要求國家政治上軌道，中日民間感情推誠相與，對於公私之間，不能不重視其界域，而為適宜合理的區分。</p>

<p>前年十二月八日大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府根據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明決與友邦日本同甘共苦。自是以來，著手新國民運動，從事保隙洽安，改善民生。期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭之完遂。乃英美等國仍沿用其百年以來分裂東亞之政策，且變本加厲，竟勾引渝方分子，參加所謂英美戰綫，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，最近因其暴力已次第為友邦日本陸海空軍所擊破，侵略東亞之根據地亦巳喪失，乃益逞狡謀。且嫉視國民政府統治區哉之和平發展，嗾使渝方分子不斷侵擾，以阻撓各種建設之進行，並　以自國飛機，藉渝方為根據，向我武漢廣州等處屢施聶炸，殘害平民，在渝方分子，甘受英美驅使，躬為東亞叛逆，固屬可恥：而英美對於束亞處心積慮，盡其挑撥離間之能事，以圖遂其最後併吞之欲，尤為東亞民族所當同仇敵愾，國民政府為此宣吿，自今日起，對英美處於戰爭狀態，當悉其全力，與友邦日水協力，一掃英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放。滿泰兩國，夙敦友好，對於東亞共榮，尤具同心，今後當益謀提携，以期共同建設以道義為基礎之東亞新秩序。德義諸友邦，數年以來，在西方與英美勢力周旋，迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相與呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秩序有所實獻，凡我國民，當知此為實現國父大亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之復興，大東亞共榮建設之實現，世界全體正義和平之獲得，胥　於此。其一德一心，戮力始終，以貫徹此偉大時代之偉大使命！</p>

<h3>北路蘇軍發動　大規模攻勢　顯以尼維爾為目標</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：星期三日東綫中路戰事之重心，巳移至維里基爾之南，蘇軍顯然集中其一切可用之軍隊於尼維爾區（Neuvl）在斯摩倫斯克四北之要城。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　據海通社訊：東綫戰局大體上並無變化，但維里基魯基（Velikiluki）方面之蘇軍於　　處於被動地位者，巳由强大之空軍協助大隊步兵與坦克車開始進攻　此項新發展與蘇軍之著名戰略完全符合，即於不定之時期移動作戰焦點是也。蘇軍於第一次進攻後，是否有充足之預備隊繼續使用壓力，目前尙　新言，果然則蘇軍　欲切斷伐特巴克至列甯格勒之鐵路，突破特離那河中部矣。蘇軍向尼維爾方面突破德軍陣地　處，但被擊退，刻在激戰中。自斯摩倫斯克至明斯克之公路至戈美爾一帶及聶伯河前終，僅有局部戰事，但普列貝特河口之蘇軍在西岸巳建立較大之橋頭堡，德軍反攻頗有進展。聶伯河西岸蘇軍其他橋頭堡，亦受德軍之控制，不能增援。柴普魯基及梅立托波爾方面戰局亦無變化，蘇軍於前綫戰况沉寂之際，正在後方集中軍隊。</p>
<p>蘇軍三個月中傷亡達二百萬</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　據海通社訊，德國消息靈通方面昨晚息：過去三月來蘇軍進攻德軍防綫時，共損失兵員二百萬人·坦克車兩萬輛·大砲約二千尊·飛機七千五百架。自東綫開戰以來，蘇軍共損失坦克車七萬輛，大砲七萬五千尊與飛機約五萬二千架。</p>

<p>柏林八日中央社電　德軍當局於七日宣稱：對於冬季作戰已有萬鑫準備，其大意謂德軍需工業現已完全由軍部部長施別爾統一管理。經軍需工業指導者會議之結果，已確定德軍絕無危險之日。第一，冬營之裝備物均齊備，刻僅餘最後之手套一項。第二，由於過去之經騐，對東綫德軍配給食糧之必要措置亦巳完成。第三，關於冬季作戰必要之武器生　亦巳大致準備就緒，故蘇軍即使於冬季發動攻勞，德軍亦可充分應戰無慮。</p>
<h3>德機大舉　空襲倫敦　兩年來所未有</h3>
<p>阿姆斯特丹八日中央社電　倫敦於星期四晚遭受兩年以來最大空襲，自一九四一年五月十日後，倫敦從來未經過如此次嚴重之空襲者，倫敦區中數處均被擲彈，損失之外尙有死傷，當空襲時全市為之震動。</p>
<h3>英冒險玩火　將自食其果　郭培爾著文警告</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央電社　德宣傳部長郭培爾昨日發表：現在之戰事，已造成英人恐怕再戰之心理，因自知其實不能於人力上再作如上次大戰之犧牲。郭培爾於其論文「命運之鐘」篇內宣稱：英人絕對倚賴蘇聯，因蘇聯直至今日，乃負此次戰事之極大部份。現　少數戰爭之魔鬼及因戰事而獲益之徒外，無不希望戰爭之結束、而戰爭之如何結束，現尙成問題、而一般人之精神上有若戰事初期之分歧狀態，在此次戰爭全要之利害衝突並未獲得解決，現戰爭所以達到如此之劇烈者，實因英人自知其不能再作同樣之戰爭。英人現已不能如上次大戰所作同樣人力之消耗，故英人途因蘇聯之首當其衝而欣然而喜，故英國對蘇聯之熱誠，乃蘇聯對英人服務之酬報，而英政府顯已漢視此種態度，將引起重大之後果，雖則倫敦方面抱有「能避免上述危機」之盛覺，但事實巳證明其是相反之方向。蘇聯主義對於歐洲觀念之影響，巳使英國發生重要之變動，英人應謹記現在若發生革命。巳不若在二十年前之較為無害，現今所受危險者並非少數個人，而為歐洲之整個思想。英國能否冒險以玩火，非吾人所可決定，但重要之問題，為可否使英國之公衆對於威脅仍受朦蔽，此項威脅掩飾巧妙，則更為嚴重。五人從不諱言吾人認為成脅歐洲之危險，乃歐洲各國所共有者，惜平吾人此項正確之意旨，未為一般人所瞭解。」</p>

<p>瑞典京城八日中央社電　阿萊亨特報評英·美·蘇三國外長將舉行會議之事件謂：蘇聯將要求合併波羅的海三國，波蘭白俄維斯之部份，以及貝薩拉比亞地區。克姆林宮或將要求巴爾幹半島，以達阿得里亞海之岸，皆屬於蘇聯之勢力範圍，但所謂勢力範圍一語，能作多方面之解釋，且蘇聯對於伊朗政府之要求，以亦有提出之可能。蘇聯對芬蘭及土耳其之態度似覺模糊，而蘇聯對芬蘭之要求，其汲低限度將包括領土及改組芬蘭政府之要求，但土耳其管領下之韆靼尼爾海峽，蘇聯亦深感興趣，故蘇聯或將要求控制該海峽，最低限度該處亦應受國際管理。應有注意者，美人常認「以小事大」，乃極合理之事者也。</p>

<h3>日報道當局　昨發表談話</h3>
<p>艦隊報道部長</p>
<p>中央社訊松島艦隊報道部長，就大東亞戰爭進行上發表意見如下：太平洋戰爭之要點，在於所羅門及新幾內亞二處，美對東亞進攻的路綫有三：　自阿留由　島進攻日本，　自夏威夷方面進攻日本，　則經澳洲進攻日本，所以現在美對所羅門及新幾內亞之猛攻，在確保其南方進攻路綫，並在保衛澳洲的策略上，亦進攻所羅門及新幾內亞，美對此二島方面作戰之情形，依據吾人之觀察，前途頗為悲觀，美在所羅門及新幾內亞該處作戰情形極為猛烈，而其所受損失，亦極為　人，與日本比例，則平均為九與一之比，其損失與日比較最少為四比一，最大為三十比一，相差極遠，美因損失　重，故不得不對民衆擴大虛僞宣傳，以事　蔽，且其人力物力之損失極夥，而官方發表則每謂損失極微，關於此種情形，有一曾從作戰之第一綫觀察而返之美參議院議員，共和黨中堅凱簿脫勞其，鑒於政府揑造戰果與實際情形相反，表示極度不滿，此種美國虛僞宜傳，在英國亦復如此，如英國情報處安尼斯多　杜，亦曾發表意見，大意謂彼等受軸心國威脅，現已過去，但得人為逮到最後勝利起見，終得集中一切資源，不願反軸心國無謂宣傳，新幾內亞方面美以一年之久，僅佔有三〇〇公里之土地，而人力消耗極大，但美方旣受此重大損失，而仍　　作戰，吾人實抱有懷疑，推共原因，或另有其政治作用，因現在緬甸已經獨立，葬列寶亦將於本月十四日獨立，此二地已進行解放，此種民族解放運動，使美國感受相當衝動，所以用此掩蔽，最近反軸心國對緬甸發動進攻之謠言，濟傳頗廣，此亦為　方所發，因大島島南島島方面美展開遊擊戰，共原因係一種神經戰，但對日本作戰體系，無甚影響，對反軸心國方面，日本現以有力部隊，取得主動有利地位，確保有利地位，發動攻擊反軸心攻擊的攻擊，無論其取任何攻勢，徒見心勞日拙，蓋日本並無顧慮也。</p>
<p>廣田情報課長</p>
<p>日本大使館上海事務所廣田情報部長昨在陸海外聯合報道常會席上。發表談話，對反軸心國最近游說聯合發動攻勢之舉，特加以分析批評，並闡明日本所取立傷。</p>
<p>首謂九月上旬英任命　特巴賴為駐東南亞洲聯合軍司令以來，對緬甸方面之進攻謠傳紛起，尤以最近雨季時期將逝，而蒙氏亦認為雨季巳過，遂以反軸心對緬之攻擊作為游說，致謠言紛起，此種謠傳不能謂為毫無根據，並謂反軸心已作之準備，在九月至十月問，反軸心空軍時飛安　麥　島往返偵察，是以視反軸心　政擊緬甸部縣之主力甚地在駐印之英美聯軍及在雲南待機而動之渝軍之所在地。</p>
<p>日本極願靜候反軸心空軍之　臨，從容予以殲滅盡，而反軸心之對緬反攻較渝相差太遠，照日本之立塲觀察，英美渝實有從速反省之必要。在現實上，諸君均知緬甸之獨立，除日本一國外，且已有六個國家承認。</p>
<p>防禦日緬甸部隊之中心除日本軍隊外，尙有印度義勇軍且有馬來守備隊等參加，領袖卽江遂拉鮑斯，謀印度之解放，日本對印獨立曾予以最大協助。</p>
<p>我人為檢討英美及渝方，可分下述數點而言：　英任華維爾將軍任印總督，以加强壓迫印民衆，　查　渝之運離路綫在南方計有三處，一為緬甸，其二在印滇路錢，印藏路綫為第三，渝對打通緬甸路綫內心躁急，故有參預此次反攻緬甸企圖。但美方處處不尊重渝方而利用中國為空襲日本之要據地，易言之，對渝之目的，實為地理上之利用耳。且英美蘇三國會議，獨未見有渝方之參加，此點足見英美對渝毫無誠意，很渝未放棄與英美共同作戰以前，渝政府之在緬甸作戰，實不啻為反對東亞之正義而戰也。</p>

<p>其次忠救軍之不逞詭謀為衆所週知之事實，似由戴笠所操縱，戴笠亦曾親自視察廣德，編制方面係由三縱隊所組成，此外尙有南京行動總隊蘇錫行動總隊上　行動總隊等等之等務戰隊，以往破瓖鐵路工作概為彼等之詭謀。</p>
<p>此次作戰渝軍至少有五師，無法再起，在洽安上經濟上以及經濟上作戰意森俱極重人，尤共渝方最近頻作反實傳，謂在華日市抽調他處無力貿施進攻作戰云云，企圖攪亂和平地區民心。觀於此次作戰，可證明日軍戰力增大，並無任何滅少，且不論塲所及時間如何，如有必要，產即可向任何地點展開通攻作戰。總之，日軍對渝軍態度並無任何幾更，彼等旣犧牲國民繼續無理抗戰，日軍自當與之周旋到底」</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>業外人囤貨</h3>
<p>本市各主要商品同業公會，鑒於近來百物售價雖已精轉平落，但少數物品價格，竟仍乍升乍降，以致市况不克持久穩定，究其　　所在，實因若干素不營商之市民，眼前利用其充厚寶金，托人辦貨隱積，故決定備文呼　關係當局，以政治力量，　絕非商人及業外人購　任何物資、此一決定，不當隱示由來囤貨黑幕的又一重，依然懸掛在以前商人非法囤積的幕後。</p>
<p>因此，一般人相信登記不符的紗布廠門以外，斷然還有許多業外人隱積着大量的紗布。由於他們資金之充厚，隱積數量，必有可觀；由於他們設計之周密，隱積塲所，非必上海；由於他們手腕之靈活，　　屏幛，必有所恃。在這樣一個情况之下，可知許多登記不符之紗布以外，定還有許多不曾登記而為業外人所有之紗布，有不能使其水落石出，則攸關紗布配給前途者，自屬甚旦。以紗布一項類推，業外人囤積其他商品，又可知業外人囤貨一個作風，足以影響整個配給制度者，實非淺鮮。茲者當局對於業外人非法囤貨，已寄予密切注意，並將設法澈查，以期消滅，自是安定整個工商業與强化配給制度的一個重要步驟。</p>
<h3>油糧專委會　準備收買配給　各地生產情形良好</h3>
<p>蘇浙皖三省各地區所產之雜糧，大豆，小豆，苞米，高梁，菜籽，落花生及胡麻等。均特逐次登塲，共收買運銷</p>
<p>配給工作</p>
<p>將由商統會油糧專業委員會暨其所屬各地區辦事處協力擔任之。他如製遺儲藏，貿易交換，價格調整，品貨規格，增產及改良等時事項，亦歸於該一系統職權範圍之內。按今年三省各牠油糧生產，情形可稱良好，目下所最宜考慮者，厥為如何將產物運至中心地點，或加工製造之塲所，在一個合理之價格下，公允分佈於廠商或直接間接之消費者。即以　巿而論，榨油廠卽有多家，其開工因原料問題時斷時續，益以外埠成油運滬不若想象之順利，故食油供應未能穩定。是以油糧專業委同會鑒於社會付託之重，期待之殷，將設法使收買所得之油糧原料，撥交各榨油廠，充製造食油之用。</p>

<h3>蘇省政治之　過去與前瞻</h3>
<p>— 馮國楨</p>
<p>江蘇　文薈萃，物產富庶，為全國政治經濟文化中心。自國府還都，經高冠吾氏一度出任省政，繼之者為李士　氏。主政以來，實施清鄉，迄已二年，此次因病故出缺。中樞以陳入鶴氏繼任，陳氏富於瞻戲，具幹濟才，必能為蘇政前途，放一異彩，自可預期。作者蘇人，願就二年來蘇省施政上所獲之印象，實其所見，以備　擇。</p>
<p>二年來的印象</p>
<p>一，蘇省合大江南北計之，巳實施淸鄉者約二十　，胥為馳名之富　地眞誠的協助及李氏多時之苦心　劃，並耗大恩之人力物力，尙能做到確立治安一點：惟在進一步欲從政治經濟文化各方面，開展高度淸鄉工作時，則　未見　惱人意，獲得預期之効果。今李氏巳矣，其個人之成敗，毀響，當有定論，為另一間題，所可得而言者，李氏明爽豪　，另具作風，如縣長為親民之官，允宜愼　　能任之，而李氏綱　之人物，大抵以忠眞為引用條件，品學資歷，尙屬次　，上焉者亦僅為特工江馬功臣，借　酬　之恩典，　期其熟於吏事，勝任愉快，難矣　且李氏僕僕　　，席不暇暖。即在蘇　，亦甚　　　省府，集全力於省政，省長為全省最高領袖，雖云能持大體已足，不求事必躬親，然終不免左右弄權，滋生弊　耳。</p>
<p>一，特工僅行政之一部份，以嚴格言之，特工人員，自當以服從行政長官之指揮為原則；即退一步言，亦僅能運用細　，打入政治各　　起暗中督察作用，藉以發揮推動行政力量，方為正辦。惟李氏以兼住調統部長，亟思造成「特工支配政治」局面，在一切「權力集中特工」之原則下，　省各縣，幾無一不有特工之　　龐大組織，特工人員為李氏腹心耳目之所寄，縣長則退處無權，流弊所至，不肖者變本加厲，開公然干政之風，二年來蘇省政治之不能遽臻上理，此亦中要原因也。為李氏特工組識，歷史尙淺，分子難免複雜，雖其特工人員勇於進取，富於朝氣；而行政經騐之不足，則為通病。最近李氏似巳　及此點，實令飭各縣特工，統歸縣長指揮，惜積弊已　，一時終未易收弦更張耳。</p>
<p>一，政府一切措施自應以民心之向背為依　。二年來蘇省　局，從未有民意機關之建立。似與　國父三民主義之原則抵　，雖淸鄉地區，縣政府有縣　合協議會，鄉鎭公所有鄉鎭　治會之召集，其性質似同於民意機關，然一考其實，則所謂　　令協議會者。不特其職權並無明文規定，且民衆代表，亦無產生辦法，大抵於開會之日，由縣當局　時　樂民衆，經充代表，並集合縣屬各機關之公務人至，每用舉行會議，聊以敷衍門而，至鄉鎭自治會，共情形亦類似。政府興氏　隔閡，謂非政治上之失敗不可。前事不忘，後事之師，所望　氏於　任後，以建立省縣鄉鎭各級民意機關為先，而其　權及民衆代表產生辦法，尤應　為規定，務使各地優秀分子，均能代表民衆，集合一　，抒其所見，藉以溝通民情，為革新政治之張本。</p>
<p>一，省政之基幹在縣政，而欲縣政之推行盡　，則當以縣行政機構之强化為先決條件。現蘇省各靜觀行政機構，實離破碎，幾成一盤散沙，縣長高懸於上，名義上雖負綜理懸政之實，事實上則　屬各機關分庭抗　，　同敵體，不特　　政出多門，事權不一，　且系統不同，背景各殊，積處牽掣，因循推諉，其流弊盡有小可　管者。今後補救之道，自應從提高縣長職權，　縣政　於一元化著手，縣屬各　關，非經縣長核准，不指　獨行　，其主管人員，雖非縣長保　，亦應絕對聽，縣長之指揮監督，而省府各廳處對各縣，則當以縣府為主體，　　對縣屬各機關直接行文，事寶上如非必要，並應將縣屬各機關分別裁併，統歸縣府設科辦理。且不論設局設科，均應以合署辦公為原則，庶　縣府成一益個機關，職權集中，　政令自易推行盡　。</p>
<p>一，則為各項行政之命脈，蘇省自淸鄉以來，各項財政制度，迭經變革，最近則由財廳負統收統支之全資，其辦法：清鄉各關，由財廳直接設立徴收機關，所有　　之省稅縣稅，幷縣省之公款公　，統須　解省庫，各縣行政經費，則由縣當局　造預算，呈請省廳核　後始由　領動用，絕無調劃通融餘地。惟各縣背有特殊環境，縣當局　應付各項特殊開支，祇有出　自行措一途，如報戰某某等縣　以地方人士名義，公開組織地方事業協進會，在不抵觸法令範圍內，負責　措各項地方費用。其尤　　，則由縣府唆令各區挨戶　派，或　徴收變相之　捐，藉為　注之計，而所謂縣預算之　立則不特各縣因無民意機關切實　督，其　造預算，是否虛浮，無所　　，且以財　負覺　核者俑　主　之成見，任意　减，漫無標準，甚至　　時日，久不通過，俾便　託接洽，其流弊　有非意料所能及者。要而言之，縣為行政上　立之一級，省當　自應稍留其自由伸縮餘地，庶能發揮力量，人士北同負責保管之，縣預算之編造，應　縣稅縣款收入之多寡為標準。幷須先經民意　關之同意，再行　請省廳核准，省廳如有認為非必要時，亦不得將縣預算任意刪，　使各縣均有充分之財源，不致因　無着落，阻滯政令之推行。</p>
<p>改革的步驟</p>
<p>綜上所述，純為就事論事，非為對人而發。歸納言之，欲使江蘇政治現代化，則至少限度，應先做到下列各點：</p>
<p>縣長人選。應　量登廣　能，幷須以具備行政經騐及學識者為標準，任期至少三年，非有在故　經查有　據者，不輕　免職或停職。</p>
<p>各縣所有特工，不得自成系統，應統歸縣長負責指揮。特工之干政，　與軍閥時代駐軍之干政，胥為過渡時間之畸形現象。應即絕對予以禁止。</p>
<p>縣長對省政府負實　應擔全縣行政大權，縣政府輕　　各機關一切行文，均應　縣長名義行之。</p>
<p>省縣各級民意機關，悉由民衆推選表組織之，有向省長縣長建議政務之權，並代表民衆，對省縣各項政令，負監督推行之責。</p>
<p>縣省之公欵公至，應仍歸縣有，縣稅省税，應絕對劃分淸楚，縣稅縣欵　幷須存儲銀行，列為專欸，由地方公正人士共同負責保管之，至縣預算之編造　應視縣稅縣欵收入之多寡為標準，幷須先，戶口保甲之編査，文化教育及建設事業之復興等等　擬以作者十年前從政之經歷，參以事變以來省縣之實情，其應行改進之點，當俟異日，續有論列。茲不過　管見所及，對過去蘇政，加以檢討，藉作　　之　，冀於蘇政之革新　全一參攷焉。</p>

<h3>On "Public" and "Private"</h3>
<p>The two words "public" and "private," and their meanings, seem easy to understand and are commonly recognized by the general public. Especially for the "intellectual class," there is no need for much explanation. However, two reasons make these originally easy-to-understand concepts of "public" and "private" become blurred. First, all things and customs in the universe, precisely because they are too common and familiar, are easily forgotten in their original form. "Public" and "private," because they are too common and familiar, are no exception and are forgotten in their original form, thus becoming blurred. Second, selfishness is human nature (and can also be said to be the nature of most animals). Therefore, phenomena such as "using public office for private gain," "harming the public for private benefit," and "blurring the line between public and private" are widespread and contribute to the blurring. Therefore, the fact that the two words "public" and "private," and their meanings, are commonly recognized is true; and the fact that they are commonly disregarded and blurred is also true.</p>
<p>Take government agencies as an example. Service personnel are generally called public servants, and most of them are from the intellectual class. They certainly understand the meaning and boundaries of "public" and "private." However, if we examine them closely, most agencies and most public servants suffer from the problem of disregarding the boundaries between "public" and "private," leading to blurring. Because of the different job responsibilities, the degree of blurring varies, but the blurring itself is the same. For example, in hiring, the idea of recommending relatives, fellow villagers, and old friends is always more deeply ingrained than the concept of purely selecting people based on merit and open recruitment, especially for important positions, where they are reluctant to easily assign them to people outside their own system. They prioritize maintaining their personal position and facilitating their personal command over the success of the cause, which is a lack of clarity between public and private. However, we are not just saying one thing and ignoring the other. For people, because relatives, fellow villagers, and old friends are more clear about their character and ability and can be more trusted, as long as their ability truly matches the position and they are suitable for the task, and their performance is recognized by everyone, then in principle, there is naturally nothing to criticize. If one does not consider whether they are suitable for the task, whether their ability matches the position, but simply thinks that any relative, fellow villager, or old friend can be used, and any task can be handled, and the resulting problems are also recognized by everyone, then this is clearly a lack of clarity between public and private. Therefore, our conclusion on "appointing private individuals" should not be that relatives, fellow villagers, and old friends are private individuals, and regardless of their character and ability, they should never be appointed, as this is obviously not a fair assessment. If one regards relatives, fellow villagers, and old friends as people in one's pocket, and regardless of their character and ability, blindly introduces them, this is certainly appointing private individuals. The purpose of hiring people is entirely to serve the public, to assess their character and ability, and to assign them appropriate positions; to assess the character and ability required for the position, and to appoint suitable personnel to make them competent, happy, and successful. If this prerequisite is met, even if the referrer is a relative, fellow villager, or old friend, it is not "appointing private individuals." If the purpose of hiring people is entirely to facilitate private gain, and relatives, fellow villagers, and old friends are regarded as confidants and henchmen to accomplish private goals, this is clearly "appointing private individuals." In this way, we can use this yardstick to measure whether government agencies today are appointing private individuals and whether there is a lack of clarity between public and private.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of using money, the boundary between public and private is actually easier to distinguish, but it is often blurred by those in power. Therefore, accounting tricks are more easily manipulated, and because they are internal matters, it is difficult for outsiders to understand them, unlike the obviousness of hiring people. Therefore, we advocate that those who manage accounts should not employ relatives, fellow villagers, or old friends, even if their character and ability are suitable, to avoid suspicion. As for public servants at all levels, even those without the power to hire people or use money, they should also pay attention to the distinction between public and private. For example, in terms of time, they should abide by office hours, not be late, not leave early, and not handle private affairs during office hours. In terms of public property, they should not use public property for private purposes, and not take public property for private ownership, even for a small piece of paper or a pen, they should not neglect it. At the same time, even when using public property for public affairs, they should cherish and economize it as if it were their own.</p>
<p>What has been said above concerns the general boundaries between public and private. This applies to government agencies, as well as public organizations and even industrial and commercial organizations.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can also apply the meaning mentioned above to evaluate the distinction between public and private between Chinese and Japanese agencies and organizations today. For example, in terms of official contacts and negotiations between Chinese and Japanese agencies and organizations, many Chinese people adopt the approach of prioritizing private matters before public matters. They first emphasize establishing and cultivating personal relationships through entertaining and gift-giving, repeatedly and tirelessly, while neglecting the performance of official duties. It seems that they regard establishing and cultivating personal relationships as a means, mistakenly believing that once private relationships are close, there is no need to pay attention to official performance, and success will come naturally. In fact, this is completely wrong. To be honest, Japanese people are not playboys who can be easily influenced in public affairs after establishing good personal relationships. The result is not only a failure to establish good relationships, but also gives people a bad impression, which in turn affects future official negotiations. Therefore, we advocate not prioritizing private matters before public matters, but prioritizing public matters before private matters. First, negotiate and reach an agreement on official matters, understand and recognize each other, and then establish private friendships, which will become even closer. We should base our relationships on official negotiations and agreements, and then establish private friendships, so that the friendship is for the public good, prioritizing public matters before private matters. The closer the friendship, the smoother the negotiations, and the more beneficial the result. If private contacts and friendships are the foundation, and official performance is not emphasized, then the friendship is for private gain, prioritizing private matters before public matters. Even if the friendship is close, it will still be difficult to see beneficial results in negotiations.</p>
<p>Secondly, on the Japanese side, there are also examples of a lack of clarity between public and private. For example, for a certain Chinese person, if they subjectively believe that they have a deep friendship with them, they will assume the responsibility of protecting them, regardless of their objective character and ability. As a result, they may be used as a talisman, which further fuels their private schemes, and the public suffers. This is the legacy of a lack of clarity between public and private.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if we want national politics to be on the right track and sincere mutual trust between the Chinese and Japanese people, we must pay attention to the boundaries between public and private and make appropriate and reasonable distinctions.</p>

Prime Minister Tojo's concurrent assumption of the post of Minister of Commerce and Industry is widely regarded as Prime Minister Tojo's move to also concurrently assume the post of Minister of Munitions when the Ministry of Munitions was established on November 1st. Minister of State Kishi will assist Prime Minister Tojo in his concurrent post as Minister of Commerce and Industry, focusing on preparations for the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions. Minister of Railways Hatta's concurrent post as Minister of Communications is intended to coordinate the establishment of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and he will assume the post of minister of the new ministry. The Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce is an expansion and reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and no new personnel will be appointed. With the determination of the outline for the establishment of the new ministries, Suzuki, President of the Planning Board, and Terashima, Minister of Communications, have requested to resign. The duties of the President of the Planning Board will be temporarily assumed by Abe, Vice President of the Planning Board. The establishment of the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of Transport and Communications represents a landmark reform in the administrative structure of the Japanese government, with the aim of increasing munitions production and strengthening maritime and land transport. The cabinet personnel changes are an important adjustment to the main industrial administration under the decisive battle. Prime Minister Tojo has been very cautious in appointing the ministers. In the current situation, the Ministry of Munitions is the core of war power, so it is generally observed that it is most appropriate for the Prime Minister to personally concurrently assume the post of Minister of Munitions. Therefore, it has been decided that Prime Minister Tojo will concurrently assume the post of Minister of Munitions in addition to his concurrent post as Minister of War, concentrating military administration and munitions production administration in one person, thus establishing a strong and decisive posture under the decisive battle.</p>

<h3>National Government Declares War</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Great East Asia War on December 8th two years ago, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with its ally, Japan. Since then, it has embarked on a New National Movement, engaged in maintaining security and stability, and improving the people's livelihood, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Great East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and other countries have continued to use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified it, even colluding with elements from Chongqing to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, and sending troops to Burma and India, to have East Asians kill East Asians. Recently, because their violence has been successively defeated by the land, sea, and air forces of the allied nation Japan, and the bases for their aggression in East Asia have been lost, they have resorted to more cunning schemes. They are also jealous of the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the National Government, and have incited elements from Chongqing to constantly harass us in order to hinder the progress of various constructions, and using aircraft from their own countries, using Chongqing as a base, they have repeatedly carried out indiscriminate bombings of our Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The elements from Chongqing, willingly driven by Britain and the United States, and acting as traitors to East Asia, are indeed shameful. But the calculated plans of Britain and the United States for East Asia, exhausting their ability to provoke discord, in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, are even more what the nations of East Asia should hate together. The National Government hereby declares that, from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States, and will do its utmost, in cooperation with the allied nation Japan, to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States, in order to seek China's revival and the liberation of East Asia. The nations of Manchukuo and Thailand have always maintained friendly relations and are particularly of the same mind regarding the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In the future, they should work together even more closely in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The allied nations of Germany and Italy have been engaged in a long-term struggle with British and American forces in the West for several years, gaining the glory of repeated victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and should echo them in order to make a practical contribution to the just new order of the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the acquisition of justice and peace for the entire world all depend on this. They should be of one heart and one mind, and strive to the end, in order to fulfill the great mission of this great era!</p>

<h3>Northern Soviet Army Launches Large-Scale Offensive Aiming for Nevel</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – German News Agency reports: On Wednesday, the focus of the central sector of the Eastern Front has shifted south of Velikiye Luki. The Soviet army is apparently concentrating all available troops in the Nevel area, a key city north of Smolensk.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to Havas News Agency: The situation on the Eastern Front is generally unchanged, but the Soviet army in the Velikiye Luki area, previously in a passive position, has begun an offensive with the assistance of a strong air force and large infantry and tank units. This new development is entirely consistent with the Soviet Union's famous strategy of shifting the focus of operations at irregular intervals. It remains to be seen whether the Soviet army has sufficient reserves to maintain pressure after the initial offensive. If so, the Soviet army intends to cut off the Velikiye Luki to Leningrad railway and break through the central part of the Torosa River. The Soviet army broke through German defenses towards Nevel but was repelled and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. From Smolensk to Minsk, along the highway to Gomel, and along the Dnieper River, there are only local battles, but the Soviet army at the mouth of the Pripyat River has established a larger bridgehead on the west bank, and the German counter-offensive is making progress. Other Soviet bridgeheads on the west bank of the Dnieper River are also under German control and cannot be reinforced. There is also no change in the situation in the areas of Zaporozhye and Melitopol; the Soviet army is concentrating troops in the rear while the front line is quiet.</p>
<p>Soviet Casualties Reach Two Million in Three Months</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to Havas News Agency, well-informed German sources reported last night: In the past three months, the Soviet army has lost a total of 2 million soldiers, 20,000 tanks, approximately 2,000 artillery pieces, and 7,500 aircraft while attacking German defense lines. Since the beginning of the war on the Eastern Front, the Soviet army has lost a total of 70,000 tanks, 75,000 artillery pieces, and approximately 52,000 aircraft.</p>
<p>Germany Fully Prepared for Winter Warfare</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – German authorities announced on the 7th: They are fully prepared for winter warfare. The general idea is that German war industry is now completely under the unified management of Minister of Armaments Speer. As a result of the conference of war industry leaders, it has been determined that Germany faces no danger. First, all winter equipment is complete, with only the final item of gloves remaining. Second, based on past experience, necessary measures for food rations for the German army on the Eastern Front have also been completed. Third, the necessary weapons production for winter warfare is also largely ready, so even if the Soviet army launches an offensive in winter, the German army can fully respond without worry.</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Launch Large-Scale Air Raid on London Unprecedented in Two Years</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – London suffered its largest air raid in two years on Thursday night. Since May 10, 1941, London has never experienced such a severe air raid. Several locations in the London area were bombed, resulting in casualties and damage. The entire city shook during the air raid.</p>
<h3>Britain Playing with Fire Risks Burning Itself Goebbels Warns in Article</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – German Propaganda Minister Goebbels stated yesterday: The current war has created a fear of further warfare in the British, who realize that they cannot make the same sacrifices in manpower as in the last World War. In his essay "The Clock of Destiny," Goebbels declared: The British are absolutely reliant on the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union bears the vast majority of the current war effort. Now, apart from a few war demons and those who profit from the war, everyone hopes for the end of the war. How the war will end is still a question, and the general public's mentality is like the divided state at the beginning of the war. The fundamental conflict of interest in this war has not been resolved. The reason the war has reached such intensity is that the British know they cannot wage the same kind of war again. The British cannot make the same manpower sacrifices as in the last World War, so they are delighted that the Soviet Union bears the brunt. Therefore, Britain's enthusiasm for the Soviet Union is a reward for the Soviet Union's service to the British. The British government's obvious disregard for this attitude will lead to serious consequences. Although London harbors a strong feeling that it can avoid the above crisis, the facts have proven the opposite. The influence of Soviet ideology on European concepts has caused significant changes in Britain. The British should remember that if a revolution occurs now, it will not be as harmless as it was twenty years ago. The danger now is not just to a few individuals, but to the entire European idea. Whether Britain can risk playing with fire is not for us to decide, but the important question is whether the British public can remain blind to the threat, and the more cleverly this threat is disguised, the more serious it becomes. We have never concealed that we believe the danger threatening Europe is shared by all European countries. Unfortunately, the correctness of our intention has not been understood by the general public."</p>
<h3>Three-Nation Foreign Ministers Meeting Agenda Decided Eden to Depart for Soviet Union in a Few Days</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to London sources, British Foreign Secretary Eden will travel to Moscow in a few days to attend the foreign ministers' meeting of the anti-Axis three nations. According to London newspapers, the draft agenda has been approved, and the main proposals include the political situation in Italy and the Balkans, the future cooperation mechanisms of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the Mediterranean Committee. It is said that Britain and the United States have reached a consensus on general principles.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Aftonbladet newspaper commented on the upcoming meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, saying: The Soviet Union will demand the annexation of the three Baltic states, parts of White Russia in Poland, and the Bessarabia region. The Kremlin may also demand that the Balkan Peninsula, reaching the Adriatic coast, be within the Soviet sphere of influence. However, the term "sphere of influence" can be interpreted in many ways, and the Soviet Union may also raise its demands on the Iranian government. The Soviet Union's attitude towards Finland and Turkey seems ambiguous, and the Soviet Union's demands on Finland will include territorial demands and the reorganization of the Finnish government at a minimum. However, the Soviet Union is also deeply interested in the Dardanelles Strait under Turkish control, so the Soviet Union may demand control of the strait, or at least that it be subject to international management. It should be noted that Americans often consider "using the small to control the large" to be a very reasonable thing.</p>
<h3>Mountbatten to Go to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Before taking office, Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Commander Mountbatten had many disagreements with various parties, so the scope of his command must be adjusted accordingly. He arrived in New Delhi on the 7th. According to Indian sources, after taking office, he immediately established the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters and held several agreements with various generals. He also plans to visit Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing to discuss issues related to the new headquarters and future cooperation with Chongqing.</p>

<h3>Grain Transport and Sales Management Areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces Yuan Ludeng Speaks on Grain Control</h3>
<p>Director Yuan of the Grain Control Committee spoke to reporters from the Shanghai News Agency yesterday, saying: "I, Ludeng, have been ordered to preside over grain control matters, and I am ashamed of my inadequacy and the difficulty of this task. I feel deeply limited and surpassed, but at this time of chaos and hardship, I am deeply concerned and dare not exert my wisdom to fulfill my duty. Now that the work of collection, storage, allocation, and distribution is about to begin, I would like to briefly express my views as far as my limited knowledge allows, to inform all sectors. Grain control involves countless details, and issues related to control, such as increasing production, ensuring security, developing transportation, and limiting consumption, are also very numerous. A sound organization relies on the full cooperation of all sectors of society. One wrong step can ruin the entire effort, so I deeply hope that all sectors of society will work hard in their respective positions and jointly solve the problem. Do not think that since the Grain Control Committee has been established, the food problem can be ignored, or that when people feel a slight food shortage, they will be impatient and unable to obtain practical benefits, only increasing the difficulties of those in charge. This is something that all sectors should recognize. As for the operation of grain, it is planned to be based on two principles: one is to prevent producers from suffering losses, to increase the interest in production, and to reward the hard work of production; the other is to ensure that consumers are allocated fairly, with no waste and no fear of starvation. The saying goes, 'Do not worry about scarcity but worry about inequality.' At this time, we should urgently save and economize, which is beyond dispute. Grain control is to strengthen economy and make the people of the whole country share the hardships together. This is the second point. Finally, to make the control successful, the problem of personnel is also extremely important. Grain control is still in its infancy and must be given a good start and establish a model. I, Ludeng, am in a leading position, and I will strictly supervise all staff members to ensure that corruption is eliminated and the atmosphere is clean. I also hope that all sectors of society will pay attention and report any problems they see at any time, so that we can hear and respond widely and complete our mission. This is the third point. In short, grain control has a significant impact on people's livelihoods and cannot be borne by a few people. I hope that the government authorities and all sectors of society will not hesitate to assist and support me."</p>
<p>Second Phase Registration for Procurement Traders</p>
<p>The registration of preparatory committee members for local grain procurement trade associations for the first phase of the Grain Control Committee ended on the 3rd of this month.

The deadline for the second phase of applications is set for October 10th. All procedures should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the establishment guidelines.</p>

<h3>Vice President Zhou Discusses Procurement Policy</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Executive Yuan Vice President and Materials Review Committee Chairman Zhou Fohai made the following statement: The Executive Yuan has recently ordered the Grain Control Committee to establish grain procurement trade associations and formulate provisional regulations for grain transport and sales management. The grain purchase price has also been recently determined. From now on, grain administration can proceed smoothly, which is gratifying. The grain issue is important for stabilizing people's livelihoods, ensuring security, and promoting economic facilities. For example, how to determine the purchase price affects farmers' production and public consumption, which is of great concern to the general public. When approving the price, the authorities have decided on the principle of no changes this year. They have first investigated the cost of grain production as the basic data for the net price for farmers, and then enabled the purchasers to engage in procurement at a reasonable and minimum cost. Then, the purchase price is determined to protect the interests of general consumers in order to avoid any regrets. In the past, the situation of grain procurement was very poor. On the production side, some deliberately hoarded goods, waiting for a price increase, or illegally transported them privately to seek profit. On the purchaser's side, some also forcibly bought from farmers at low prices, attempting to profit in the middle, or even using their authority to obstruct transportation and levy excessive taxes. Such behaviors are deplorable. From now on, it is hoped that both officials and the people will understand the government's intent and cooperate with each other in grain procurement and supply to ensure complete success. Officials should abolish improper interference and provide well-intentioned assistance, while the people should abide by the law and be happy to transport grain. Otherwise, the government will not tolerate those who violate the law and act for personal gain, whether they are officials or civilians, for the sake of promoting grain administration and stabilizing the people's food supply.</p>

<p>Shanghai Blockade Management Office Discusses Grain Blockade Issues</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Since the Central Government promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Grain Blockade in the Clearing Area of the Lower Yangtze River," the Shanghai Special City Clearing Area Blockade Management Office, in order to strictly implement and launch the blockade work, specially convened a grain blockade discussion meeting at the City Government Conference Hall at 2:00 p.m. on the 6th of this month, inviting relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities to attend. Those attending included Director Mo Yade of the Blockade Management Office, representatives Wu Huanru and Xu Shaowen of the Grain Control Committee, representative Liu Enhong of the City Food Bureau, representatives Yoshida Toyotaka, Kurita Minoru, and Yasuda Heika of the Liaison Department of Shanghai Special City, representatives Lieutenant Shanauchi and Lieutenant Hosokawa of the Allied Security Command, and attendees Xu Xinbing, Su Wenxuan, and Yu Zheng, city government economic advisors Tahikita Soji, Iejichi Yoshitsugu, and Okamoto Tadao, totaling more than 20 people. Chairman Mo Yade gave the opening speech and proposed a "Rules for Issuing Special Grain Transportation Permits for the Clearing Area" drafted in accordance with Article 2 of the provisional measures for grain blockade issued by the Central Government in order to improve grain blockade work, requesting joint research. Director Wu also raised two points related to the problem of food rice in the Clearing Area after the implementation of the grain blockade and discussed countermeasures: If the food rice in the Clearing Area is insufficient to meet its own needs, how should it be resolved after the source is cut off due to the blockade? Food rice allocation only refers to the Shanghai urban area. Can the food rice outside the Shanghai blockade line and in the Clearing Area be allocated in the same amount as the urban area? If not, or if the allocation is insufficient, how should it be remedied? As a result of the discussion, due to the significant impact, it was not easy to resolve at once, so it was decided to convene another discussion meeting to thoroughly discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>The News Agency Reports the Authorities Yesterday Released a Statement</h3>
<p>Fleet News Department Chief</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the News Department Chief of the Matsushima Fleet expressed the following views on the progress of the Greater East Asia War: The key points of the Pacific War lie in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. There are three routes for the United States to attack East Asia: attacking Japan from the Aleutian Islands; attacking Japan from the Hawaiian Islands; and attacking Japan via Australia. Therefore, the current fierce attacks by the United States on the Solomon Islands and New Guinea are to secure their southern invasion route. Moreover, they are also attacking the Solomon Islands and New Guinea as a strategy to protect Australia. According to our observations, the situation of the US operations on these two islands is quite pessimistic. The US operations in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea are extremely fierce, and their losses are also extremely staggering. The ratio compared to Japan is, on average, nine to one. Their losses compared to Japan are at least four to one, and at most thirty to one, a huge difference. Due to heavy losses, the United States has to expand false propaganda to the public in order to cover up the truth. Furthermore, their loss of manpower and materials is extremely large, while official announcements always claim minimal losses. Regarding this situation, a US Senator from the Republican party's hard core, Cabot Lodge Jr., who had returned from observing the front lines of the war, expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the government's fabrication of war results that contradict the actual situation. This kind of American false propaganda is also prevalent in England. For example, Aniston, of the British Information Service, also expressed the opinion that the threat they faced from the Axis powers has passed, but in order to achieve the final victory, they must concentrate all resources and avoid pointless anti-Axis propaganda. In New Guinea, the US has only occupied 300 kilometers of land in a year, while consuming a huge amount of manpower. However, we are skeptical that the US is still continuing to fight despite suffering such significant losses. The underlying reason may be another political motive, because Burma has already become independent, and the Funeral Islands will also become independent on the 14th of this month. These two regions are undergoing liberation, and this national liberation movement has made the United States feel quite impacted. Therefore, they are using this to cover up. Recently, rumors of an anti-Axis attack on Burma have spread widely, and these were also initiated by the US. The guerilla warfare launched by the US in the Oshima Islands, South Island, and other islands is a kind of psychological warfare, but it does not have much impact on Japan's combat system. Regarding the anti-Axis powers, Japan is currently taking the initiative and securing a favorable position with powerful forces, launching attacks on anti-Axis offensives. No matter what offensive they take, they will only see their efforts come to naught, because Japan has no concerns.</p>
<p>Hirota, Chief of the Information Section</p>
<p>Hirota, the chief of the Information Section of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, gave a speech at the joint Army-Navy news conference yesterday. He analyzed and criticized the recent attempts by anti-Axis countries to lobby for a joint offensive and clarified Japan's position.</p>
<p>He first stated that since the appointment of Mountbatten as the Commander of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia in early September, rumors of an offensive on Burma have been rife. Especially recently, as the rainy season is about to end, and Mountbatten also believes that the rainy season has passed, he has been using the anti-Axis attack on Burma as a form of lobbying, leading to a proliferation of rumors. These rumors cannot be said to be without basis, and it is said that the preparations made by the anti-Axis powers in the period from September to October show that the anti-Axis air force has been repeatedly flying reconnaissance missions back and forth to Andaman Island. It can be seen that the main force of the anti-Axis powers attacking Burma is the British and American Allied Forces stationed in India and the Chongqing army waiting for action in Yunnan.</p>
<p>Japan is extremely willing to quietly await the arrival of the anti-Axis air force and leisurely annihilate them completely. The anti-Axis counter-offensive against Burma is too far removed from Chongqing. From Japan's standpoint, it is necessary for the British, Americans, and Chongqing to reflect as soon as possible. In reality, everyone knows that, apart from Japan, Burma's independence has been recognized by six countries.</p>
<p>The core of the forces defending Burma consists not only of Japanese troops, but also the Indian Volunteer Army and the Malay Defense Force, led by Jiang Sura Bose, who is seeking the liberation of India, and Japan has provided the greatest assistance to India's independence.</p>
<p>We can analyze the British, American, and Chongqing forces from the following points: The British appointed General Wavell as the Governor-General of India to strengthen the oppression of the Indian people. There are three transportation routes from Chongqing: one is Burma, the second is the India-Yunnan road, and the India-Tibet route is the third. Chongqing is anxious to open up the Burma route, so it intends to participate in this counter-offensive against Burma. However, the United States does not respect Chongqing everywhere but uses China as a key base for air raids on Japan. In other words, the purpose for Chongqing is purely geographical exploitation. Furthermore, Chongqing was not included in the tripartite conference of the British, American, and Soviet nations. This point shows that the British and Americans have no sincerity towards Chongqing. Unless Chongqing abandons joint operations with the British and Americans, the Chongqing government's operations in Burma are nothing more than fighting against the justice of East Asia.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow is National Day Anniversary - The Entire City Celebrates by Hanging Flags - Ceremonies and Military Parade Held</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Tomorrow is National Day. At this moment, after the recovery of the concession areas and the unification of municipal administration, celebrating the Double Tenth Festival holds even greater significance as we construct a new Shanghai. In order to expand the celebration and warmly commemorate the occasion, the Municipal Government has issued a special order:</p>
<p>Flags to be Hung in Celebration</p>
<p>All agencies, schools, companies, shops, etc. should raise and lower their flags according to the Municipal Government's regulations.

The troops participating in the parade will include the Education Corps, the Education Supplementary Corps, and the security forces from Fengxian, Nanhui, Baoshan, Beiqiao, Chongming, and other districts, as well as three squadrons of the Guarding Task Force stationed in the four districts of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Murderer of Dancer Executed by Hanging</p>
<p>Hua Liying, a former dancer at the Metropole, was murdered and robbed of money and jewelry in her residence at No. 59 Hengmao Lane, Mintiniyin Road, in the former French Concession last November. Subsequently, the former French police arrested the main offender, Zhang Hongsheng, and two accomplices, and handed them over to the Special Second Court for sentencing. Zhang was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment, and Jiang was sentenced to 7 years of imprisonment. The prosecutor appealed to the Higher Third Branch on the grounds that the original sentence was too light. The Higher Third Branch changed the sentence, sentencing Zhang to death and Jiang to 15 years of imprisonment. The appeal to the Supreme Court was also rejected, so the case was finalized. With the approval of the Ministry of Justice Administration, the Local Prosecutor's Office identified Zhang, inquired about his age and origins, and then sent him for execution. The judicial police carried out the execution by hanging according to law.</p>
<p>News sent out yesterday at 7:05 AM</p>
<h3>Spokesman for the Japanese Army Explains the Battle Situation in the Five Lakes Area</h3>
<p>The spokesperson for the Japanese Army Press Department met with the press corps on the 8th and made the following remarks regarding the Autumn Offensive Operation in the Five Lakes area:</p>
<p>"On the night of September 30, elite units of the Japanese Army in Central China launched an offensive from three directions: south of Wuhu, south of Shenyang, and west of Taihu Lake, carrying out an autumn offensive operation in the Yangtze River Delta area, namely the Five Lakes region. By the evening of October 1, they had advanced to the line of Yongcheng, Langxi, and Shandingqiao. By the evening of the 2nd, they had occupied Guangde, the base of the Loyalty and Salvation Army. The Chongqing troops in the area, belonging to the 52nd Division, 62nd Regiment, 192nd Division, the Vanguard Second Column of the 28th Army, and the Loyalty and Salvation Army, numbered approximately 32,000. Due to the rapid and decisive attacks by the Japanese Army, they completely lost their will to fight and retreated south in disarray. The Japanese Army, in close coordination with the Air Force, cut off their retreat route and encircled them, and is currently expanding the results of the battle. This region was originally the so-called Five Lakes Plain, with fertile land and abundant crops, not to mention the rich mineral resources such as iron and coal. In the vicinity of Guangde alone, there are 700,000 people, making it an important economic base for Chongqing. Furthermore, the Loyalty and Salvation Army had been using this place as a base, secretly planning and carrying out various treacherous schemes in peaceful areas, such as sabotage and assassination of important figures. This operation has completely destroyed this base for Chongqing, and it can be said to have made a great contribution to the establishment of security in peaceful areas.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the treacherous schemes of the Loyalty and Salvation Army are well-known facts, and they seem to be manipulated by Dai Li, who has personally inspected Guangde. Organizationally, it is composed of three columns, in addition to combat teams such as the Nanjing Action General Team, the Su-Xi Action General Team, and the Shanghai Action General Team. In the past, the sabotage of railways was generally their treacherous scheme.</p>
<p>In this operation, the Chongqing troops have lost at least five divisions and cannot rise again. It has extremely important implications for security, economics, and morale in Chongqing. In particular, Chongqing has recently frequently fabricated counter-propaganda, claiming that the Japanese Army has withdrawn troops from China and is unable to launch an offensive operation, attempting to disrupt the people's hearts in peaceful areas. This operation proves that the Japanese Army's combat strength has increased and has not decreased in any way. Moreover, regardless of the location or time, if necessary, we can launch an offensive operation at any location. In short, the Japanese Army's attitude towards the Chongqing troops has not changed in any way. Since they are sacrificing the people and continuing their unreasonable resistance, the Japanese Army will certainly fight them to the end."</p>
<p>Economic Circle - Commentary</p>
<h3>Non-Businessmen Hoarding Goods</h3>
<p>The major trade associations of this city, in light of the fact that although the prices of most goods have generally stabilized and declined, the prices of a few items are still rising and falling erratically, causing the market situation to be unsustainable. The underlying reason is that some citizens who are not in the business sector are taking advantage of their substantial capital to entrust others to procure goods and hoard them secretly. Therefore, they have decided to prepare a document calling on the relevant authorities to use political power to prohibit non-merchants and non-industry insiders from purchasing any goods. This decision inevitably implies that another layer of the hoarding scandal is still hanging behind the illegal hoarding by merchants in the past.</p>
<p>Therefore, people generally believe that, in addition to the unregistered gauze factories, there must be many non-industry people secretly hoarding large quantities of gauze. Because of their abundant capital, the amount of hoarding must be considerable. Because of their careful planning, the location of hoarding is not necessarily in Shanghai. Because of their flexible means, the protective screen must be something to rely on. Under such circumstances, it can be known that, in addition to many unregistered gauze fabrics, there must be many gauze fabrics that have not been registered and are owned by non-industry people. If it is impossible to uncover the truth, then what is related to the future of gauze rationing is, of course, very important. By analogy with the item of gauze, it can be known that non-industry people hoarding other commodities and a non-industry hoarding style are sufficient to affect the entire rationing system. The authorities have paid close attention to illegal hoarding by non-industry people and will find ways to investigate thoroughly in order to eliminate it, which is an important step in stabilizing the entire industry and commerce and strengthening the rationing system.</p>
<h3>Oil and Grain Special Committee - Preparing for Procurement and Rationing - Good Production Conditions in Various Places</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous grains, soybeans, small beans, corn, sorghum, rapeseed, peanuts, and sesame seeds produced in various regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces are gradually entering the market, and the procurement, transportation, and sales of these items for the</p>
<p>Rationing Work</p>
<p>will be jointly undertaken by the Oil and Grain Special Committee of the Business Management Committee and its subordinate offices in various regions. Other matters such as manufacturing, storage, trade exchange, price adjustment, product specifications, increased production, and improvement are also within the scope of authority of this system. According to this year's oil and grain production in the three provinces, the situation can be described as good. The most appropriate consideration at present is how to transport the products to the central location or the place of processing and manufacturing, and how to fairly distribute them to manufacturers or direct and indirect consumers at a reasonable price. Taking Shanghai as an example, there are many oil pressing factories, and their operations are intermittent due to raw material problems. In addition, the transportation of finished oil to Shanghai from other ports is not as smooth as imagined, so the supply of edible oil has not been stable. Therefore, in view of the heavy trust and earnest expectations of society, the Oil and Grain Special Committee will find ways to allocate the oil and grain raw materials purchased to various oil pressing factories for the purpose of manufacturing edible oil.</p>
<p>The Third Phase of the Thrift and Savings Week - Accepting Deposits from Yesterday</p>
<p>Savings industries have stipulated that from the 8th of each month during the week it is 'Saving Week' and the various savings banks will extend their opening hours by an hour specifically to take deposits related to saving. This has been practiced since August and the results have been very good. Yesterday was October 8th, the first day of the third stage of saving week, and all savings banks followed the trend and extended their opening hours to receive saving deposits. The interest rate given during this saving week is generally higher than normal, and the safety of the saving and deposits is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Stock Exchange - Postpones the Opening Date</p>
<p>The names of the brokers who applied for registration at the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange and who have been examined by the authorities of the stock exchange and approved by the Ministry of Industry have been announced in the first batch, totaling thirty-nine.

Furthermore, after the exchange held a resumption ceremony on the 29th of last month, it was originally scheduled to officially open on the 8th. Now it is heard from the authorities of the exchange that the construction of the market layout has not been completed, and all procedures for handling and notifying the Supervisory Committee to review and approve qualified listed stocks will also take a considerable amount of time. Therefore, the date of the official opening will be postponed slightly, probably a few days after National Day.</p>
<p>Hua Stock - Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks initially flattened wearily until around 11:30, then suddenly became firm. The securities market resumed business after the holiday.

<p>Commercial Situation Summary</p>
<p>Public Debt - Yesterday the market was still dim and listless, people's hearts were still floating, and market prices continued to be depressed. Since the consignees were very picky about the spot goods, the holders were afraid that it would be difficult to hand over the goods, so they all sold off. The consignees were also afraid that it would be easy to receive the goods but difficult to deliver them, so there were more sellers than buyers, and the market price gradually declined day by day. Yesterday, Type C fell more sharply, and Types A and E also entered the pass. Types B and D had no transactions. From today until next Monday, the market will be closed for three days due to the Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains - Rice shipments were scarce, and retail sales initially weak but later active, with small movements by retail investors. There were rises and falls in the market, and as a result, thick and thin broken new japonica and other goods fell slightly, while bean cake and soybeans remained at the original level.</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials - Mixed fatigue and mutual consultation. Soap raw materials saw a reduction due to scarcity. Cosmetic raw materials had slightly active retail sales and showed a slight color. However, dye factory raw materials were still stagnant and lacked vitality.</p>
<p>Medicinal Materials - Transactions were quite rare, with mostly sporadic buyers. Except for Guangzhou goods, which were more active, the rest were sluggish and lacked fresh color.</p>

<h3>The Past and Future of Jiangsu Province's Politics</h3>
<p>— Feng Guozhen</p>
<p>Jiangsu is a place where culture and talent gather, and its products are abundant. It is the political, economic, and cultural center of the country. Since the National Government returned to Nanjing, Gao Guanwu once served as the head of the provincial government, followed by Li Shishi. Since taking office, he has implemented rural pacification for two years, and now he has passed away due to illness. The central government appointed Chen Yuru to succeed him. Chen is rich in foresight and has the talent to manage the country. It is expected that he will add a different brilliance to the future of Jiangsu's politics. The author is a native of Jiangsu and is willing to share his impressions of Jiangsu's administration in the past two years, based on what he has seen, for selection.</p>
<p>Impressions of the Past Two Years</p>
<p>1.  Taking into account both the north and south of Jiangsu Province, about twenty counties have implemented rural pacification. This was achieved with the sincere assistance of renowned wealthy localities and Li's painstaking planning, as well as the expenditure of a great amount of manpower and material resources. It was still possible to establish a semblance of security. However, when it came to further developing high-level rural pacification work in terms of politics, economy, and culture, the results were not satisfactory, and the expected effects were not achieved. Now that Li has passed away, his personal successes and failures will be judged. This is another matter. What can be said is that Li was bright and straightforward, with his own style. For example, he believed that county magistrates should be officials who are close to the people and should be carefully selected. Li used loyalty as the primary criterion for appointing officials, with qualifications and experience being secondary. The best appointees were only special agents and meritorious officials, using the favor of rewarding them. It was difficult to expect them to be familiar with official affairs and perform their duties happily. Moreover, Li was always busy and rarely had time to rest. Even in Jiangsu, he rarely visited the provincial government, focusing all his efforts on provincial affairs. Although it is said that a provincial governor only needs to grasp the overall situation and does not need to handle everything personally, it is inevitable that those around him will manipulate power and create corruption.</p>
<p>2.  Special agents are only a part of the administration. Strictly speaking, special agents should follow the instructions of the administrative head. Even if we take a step back, they can only use spies to infiltrate various political departments and play a role in secretly supervising and promoting administrative power. However, Li, who also served as the director of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau, was eager to create a situation where "special agents dominate politics." Under the principle of "concentrating all power in the special agents," almost every county in the province had a large organization of special agents. The special agents were Li's confidants, and the county magistrates were powerless. As a result, unscrupulous people became even more reckless and openly interfered in politics. This is also an important reason why Jiangsu's politics could not quickly improve in the past two years. Li's special agent organization had a short history, and its members were inevitably complex. Although the special agents were brave and enterprising, they generally lacked administrative experience. Recently, Li seemed to have realized this and ordered the special agents in each county to be under the command of the county magistrate. However, the accumulated problems were difficult to solve in a short period of time.</p>
<p>3.  All government measures should be based on the support of the people. In the past two years, there has been no establishment of public opinion organs in Jiangsu Province. This seems to be in conflict with Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Although county governments in rural pacification areas have county joint consultation committees, and township public offices have township self-government meetings, which seem to be similar to public opinion organs, in reality, these so-called joint consultation committees have no clearly defined powers, and there are no procedures for electing representatives of the people. Generally, on the day of the meeting, the county authorities would temporarily recruit people to act as representatives and gather public servants from various county agencies to hold a meeting to fulfill the formalities. The situation in the township self-government meetings was similar. The separation between the government and the people is undoubtedly a political failure. Learning from the past can guide the future. It is hoped that Chen will prioritize the establishment of public opinion organs at the provincial, county, and township levels after taking office, and that the powers of these organs and the procedures for electing representatives of the people should be clearly defined, so that outstanding people from all over the province can represent the people, gather their opinions, and communicate public sentiment, laying the foundation for political reform.</p>
<p>4.  The foundation of provincial administration lies in county administration, and to promote county administration effectively, it is necessary to strengthen the county administrative organs first. At present, the administrative organs in Jiangsu Province are fragmented and disorganized. The county magistrate is nominally responsible for overseeing county affairs, but in reality, the various departments are independent and uncooperative. They have different systems and backgrounds, and they often obstruct each other and procrastinate. The resulting malpractices are too numerous to mention. In the future, the way to remedy this situation is to increase the authority of the county magistrate and unify county administration. No department under the county government should act independently without the approval of the county magistrate. Even if the heads of these departments are not appointed by the county magistrate, they should absolutely obey the county magistrate's command and supervision. The various departments of the provincial government should deal with the counties through the county government, and should not directly communicate with the departments under the county government. If it is not necessary, the departments under the county government should be merged and handled by the departments of the county government. Moreover, whether it is establishing bureaus or departments, the principle of joint office work should be followed, so that the county government can become a unified organ with centralized powers, and government orders can be easily implemented.</p>
<p>5.  Finance is the lifeblood of all administrative affairs. Since the rural pacification in Jiangsu Province, various financial systems have been changed repeatedly. Recently, the Department of Finance is responsible for the unified collection and expenditure of funds. The method is: In each rural pacification county, the Department of Finance directly establishes collection agencies. All provincial and county taxes, as well as public funds, must be submitted to the provincial treasury. The administrative expenses of each county are budgeted by the county authorities and submitted to the Department of Finance for approval before they can be withdrawn and used. There is no room for adjustments or compromises. However, each county has its own special circumstances, and the county authorities have to find ways to cope with various special expenses. For example, counties such as Baoshan organize local business promotion associations in the name of local people to be responsible for raising local funds within the scope of the law. Even more extreme, the county government instigates each district to collect arbitrary levies from each household or collect disguised miscellaneous taxes as a means of raising funds. The establishment of the county budget not only lacks effective supervision from public opinion organs, but it is also impossible to determine whether the budget is inflated. Moreover, the Department of Finance, which is responsible for reviewing the budget, often arbitrarily reduces it based on its own subjective opinions, without any standards. Sometimes, the budget is not approved for a long time, so that they can ask for bribes. The resulting malpractices are beyond what can be imagined. In short, the county is an independent administrative level, and the provincial authorities should leave some room for flexibility so that the county can exert its power. People from all walks of life should jointly be responsible for the safekeeping of funds. The county budget should be based on the amount of county tax revenue. It must first be approved by a public opinion organ before it can be submitted to the Department of Finance for approval. If the Department of Finance believes that something is unnecessary, it should not arbitrarily delete the county budget, so that each county has sufficient financial resources and does not hinder the implementation of government orders due to a lack of funds.</p>
<p>Steps for Reform</p>
<p>The above is purely a discussion of the matter and not directed at any individual. In summary, to modernize Jiangsu's politics, at least the following points should be achieved first:</p>
<p>The selection of county magistrates should be based on merit and ability, and they should have administrative experience and knowledge. The term of office should be at least three years. They should not be easily dismissed or suspended unless there is evidence of misconduct.</p>
<p>All special agents in each county should not form their own system and should be under the command of the county magistrate. The interference of special agents in politics, like the interference of troops stationed in the warlord era, is an abnormal phenomenon of a transitional period and should be absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p>The county magistrate should be fully responsible to the provincial government and should have full authority over county administration. All documents from the county government should be issued in the name of the county magistrate.</p>
<p>Public opinion organs at the provincial and county levels should be organized by representatives elected by the people. They have the right to advise the provincial governor and county magistrate on government affairs, and they are responsible for supervising and promoting the implementation of various government orders on behalf of the people.</p>
<p>Public funds at the county and provincial levels should still belong to the county. County taxes and provincial taxes should be clearly separated. County taxes and funds should be deposited in banks and listed as special accounts, jointly managed by local impartial people. The county budget should be based on the amount of county tax revenue. First, household registration and baojia should be compiled and the revival of cultural education and construction projects. Based on the author's experience in politics ten years ago, and the actual situation of the province and county since the incident, the points that should be improved will be discussed in the future. This is just a superficial view on the past Jiangsu politics as a mirror to provide a reference for the reform of Jiangsu politics.</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>YWCA to Launch Family Flea Market and Set Up Supplementary Classes for Women</h3>
<p>In these extraordinary times, the high cost of living affects family life. Many families are willing to sell surplus items to supplement their household income, while other families are willing to purchase needed items at lower prices to save on expenses. The Shanghai YWCA, in response to the needs of women, will open a family flea market from October 14 to 17. All are welcome to consign, sell, and buy freely, increasing women's interest in employment and promoting thrift.</p>
<p>In addition, for the sake of promoting women's education, the YWCA, in addition to the three night schools for girls that it has already established, is also opening supplementary classes for working women and housewives with junior high school education or above. The tuition fee is low, and there are free and half-price places available. Classes are held from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day at the Hongsha Middle School on Gordon Road, Jing'an Temple Road. Registration has already begun. The time is after 6:00 pm every day at the YWCA on Weihaiwei Road. The girls' classes from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm are still open for registration.</p>
