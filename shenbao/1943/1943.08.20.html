<h3 id="c1">歐洲局勢的新評斷 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>世界戰爭局勢，自本年夏季以後，開始新的變化，主要的時表現在歐洲東綫軸心軍之採取引誘戰略。吸血戰略，和蘇聯紅軍之被動攻勢，以及英美加軍之在西西里登陸。這種軍事形勢之新的轉變，曾經引起世界人士的注意和反軸心國的幻想。在英美，甚且流行着今年年底結束歐洲戰爭的樂觀論調。然而事實的發展，和英美統治者的理想距離還是很遠。迅速勝利的樂觀情緒，已經逐漸爲事實所打破了。相反的，反軸心國之間，新的危機正在醞釀。</p>
<p>從歐洲東綫的戰局而言，自最近蘇軍的被動攻勢開展以來，德軍先後給敵軍以嚴重的打擊，從奧勒爾及貝爾格勒特等處轉移陣地，準備給紅軍主力以更重的打擊。據前天的德方消息，今年七倘月中，德軍已使紅軍損失兵力達一百五十萬人，其中冬季作戰爲一百寓人，最近夏季作戰爲五十萬人。這於今後戰局之發展，有重大的影響，却是無庸置疑的。在蘇聯方面，有許多徵象，可以看出，的確具有孤注一擲的決心，如最近外交人民委員會人事之更迭，可以看出莫洛托夫有山外交崗位轉到全力主持政治局面，而使史太林專其心力於作戰指揮的趨勢。現在的戰報，多少可以判定蘇聯之戰略，在不惜一切代價，以「收復」歐洲之糧倉——島克蘭，同時近日列寗格勒區，維耶茲馬，白里安斯克至斯摩倫斯克各區的戰爭，雖然不無奪取白俄羅期與進　波羅的海三國的野心，但就紅軍的實力而言，上述各區戰爭還以牽制爲主要任務。哈科夫的爭奪戰，正在如火如茶地進行着。同時，德軍和在德軍指導下的烏克蘭義勇軍，也開始担負起反布爾塞維克戰爭的任務，這些戰局的前途，勢將成爲歐洲戰局之最重要的決定力量。</p>
<p>西西里島的戰局，已經吿一結束，然而這一戰局的政治的作用，却是方興未艾。自從反軸心軍登陸以來，雖然各方面的觀感不盡相同，然可，下列幾件事實，是不容忽視的。第一，是義大利前首相墨索里尼氏之突然辭職，震驚了任何方面的人心。在以前，我們可以說，從義大利內政以至國防，多少還存在若十虛隙，而英美傾其北非之師，以臨此孤懸之島，對於義國本土，不免發生影響。自希墨兩氏會談至墨氏辭職之後，立刻化軍事的危機爲政治的折衝，實證上則爭取德義聯合完成義國以至南歐全綫防衛的時間。現在，羅邱也不得不自認上當而有魁北克之會了。第二，最近兩年來，反軸心軍間始終成爲團結之梗的，便是所謂第二戰綫問題。美英戰力不足，自是問題的癥結所在，但同時不能忽視美英與蘇聯之間矛盾之存在，英國作戰目的，在於維持其在世界各地的帝國主義的覇權，美國則除了與英國相同的目標之外，還企圖擴展其帝國主義的權利，並接收英國的殖民地權利。而不問爲美爲英，爲要達到這種野心，他們所遇到的敵人，不僅是軸心國，還有自己的夥　蘇聯。爲此，自戰爭以來，美英的戰略，始終是保全自己的實力，坐觀德蘇兩國戰力的互相消耗。到去年，萬不得已了，才在北非登陸，隔了半年多，再在西西里登陸，美英這種戰略方向，很明顯，一是爭奪地中海的覇權，一是逐漸以兵鋒對向蘇聯，以防蘇軍向東歐及東南歐進出。當然這是大違蘇聯之期望的。西西里戰事一吿結束，最關心於美英軍動向的，不是德義，而是蘇聯，這更可看出反軸心軍內部政略與戰略的矛盾的發展。</p>
<p>新的局勢逼迫反軸心國當局有再度會議的必要。日前羅斯福邱吉爾在加拿大的哈伊德巴克作三日會談之後，羅氏於十六日返華府召集軍事與外交長官會議，而魁北克方面得英美加三國軍事長官，還在協商中，邱吉爾還在加拿大候羅斯福再度會談。蘇聯方面，正式聲明未受邀請參加，且無參加必要，但英美及中立國的消息，則美國務卿赫爾與英國外長艾登，一待窺北京羅邱二巨頭會談正式結果，或議有結論時，二人均將赴莫斯科一行。從這些電訊中，可以看出反軸心國彼此間矛盾之嚴重及對未來戰略憲見之紛歧。從中立方面的電訊，可以判定羅邱這次會談的主題，集中於：　對義大利新局勢所引起的政治問題，　英美蘇聯間政略與戰略問題，　今後對歐作戰問題。第一個問題，現在已經證實反軸心國對義和平攻勢完全失敗，不僅意大利更堅決地與軸心國團結，堅持抗戰，而且早在英美幻想中的「中立國之轉向」，實際上又已完全破減，西班牙之堅定，自不待說，土耳其之態度毫不動搖，尤使英美大感苦悶。第二個問題，蘇聯攻勢之「勝利」，其實使英美感到威脅；而蘇聯所求於英美之在西歐開闢第二戰綫，更爲英美所不敢輕易嘗試，今日英美所討論的，不外爲如何敷衍蘇聯，如「對德空中功勢」及慘炸巴黎等；關於向東綫吸引德軍，無寗說是英美所不願的。那麼，力竭聲嘶的蘇聯的「攻勢」還能支持多少日子？蘇聯與英美問的裂痕，那裏是赫爾艾登們所能彌補的？第三個問題，今後英美的戰略方向，至此已可明瞭，決不會越出地中海的範圍，也許配合着戰局，對土耳其和巴爾幹諸國的政治攻勢，會更積極地推進。</p>
<p>從歐洲說，戰爭的決定表現是在大陸上，英美的海陸兩樓戰術和空中戰爭，絕對沒有決定戰局的力量；而在大陸上，德國對於蘇聯集中全力的空前大攻勢尚是不動聲色地予以打擊，那　在準備妥善的歐陸更不待說了。據報載，日德　的軍事與外交三國會議已有提前舉行之說，我們可以拭目以待國際新局勢之開展。</p>

<h3 id="c11">羅斯福的苦悶 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 長沼弘毅</p>
<p>工潮問題弄成僵局</p>
<p>本年四月日夜，羅斯福不加考慮與煤鑛夫工會會長約翰，劉易士正面對立起來了。紀初。還不打算用高壓手段，不料所遇到的卻是一個勁敵。羅斯福的敵人，不是　易士一個之後又加上了五十　煤鑛夫。他們一天不做工，就要短少烟煤二百萬噸，無烟謀十四萬噸。而這罷丁的風潮，是很容易蔓延擴大的。克雷斯勒（汽車工業），克利扶蘭（運　業）、　納柆爾泰耶（橡膠工業），巴爾鐵摩，沃哈奧（鐵道），第德樂（汽車工業），巴發洛（橡膠工業），肯塔基（鐵工業），飛達爾披林（飛機零件）等等所謂「美國軍　工業的心臟地一，都起了騷動、而且情勢頗爲嚴重問。題不僅祭煤的事情了。煤的甲途如何呢？其總生產額的二○％用於鐵這，一七％用於取暖及其他，一二％用於發電。其餘五一％則使用於丁業。所謂工業者，在今日可說　軍需工業的別名。</p>
<p>糾紛的原因·不消護得，自然是增加工資問題。靠着時局的情勢，即使勞　者們也不好說停止戰爭罷，可是不增加工資，就不做工。這等於是不能戰爭。那麼如其提高工資。又將如何呢？自本年春季以來，漸漸地切身感到通貨膨脹之苦的羅斯福，千方百計的想盡了種種防止通貨膨脹的方法，而於四月八日訂定工咨，傣給，物價的全面牽附法。然而　其一開頭即屈服於鑛工·弄得面目全非。還有什麼比這更刺激物價的上漲呢？</p>
<p>羅斯福還想到了別的事情。「劉易士那傢伙，是多麼討厭的人啊，常一九三六年，自己的再選運動時，那搖旗吶喊的，不就是他嗎？爲了褒獎他，自己不是費盡心力的制定每週四十小時制嗎？然而後來到歐洲大戰開始時，那傢伙說些什麼？他不是說反對戰爭嗎？等到一九四○的三選運動時，他又轉到正面的敵人威爾基那裏去了。自己在選舉中獲勝后，就辭CIO（各業勞工聯合曾）的會長之職，　乎表示負氣的樣子。此次又如何呢？立在煤鑛夫的前面，竟罷起工來丁。</p>
<p>然而羅斯福不會就此甘休。甲威嚇手段呢？還是用軟騙手段？羅期福軟　並用。可是都不見效。「在五月，自已　另有別的大問題。在五月底前，總得硬一下頭皮」，於是有四日起至十五日間的停戰協定，期滿後，再延期十五日，結果，挨過五月底再說。</p>
<p>那五月四十一日，便是英美在華府舉行　五次會談的日子，前此的第四次與第五次會談中，史太林與蔣介石沒有出席，因而使會議大爲减色。自十一日起至會談終了前止，羅斯福的活　，眞可以說得八面玲瓏。</p>
<p>議會中捧了大釘子</p>
<p>會議吿終後，一霎眼父發生了罷工。六月八日，劉易士與煤鑛全公會決裂了。這時候，美國政界沒有袖手旁觀的理由。在這戰爭最猛烈的時候，即使有所爭議，也不應罷工的，這種顧全時局的　　，在議會內部也醖釀着。於是罷工彈壓法案在上下二院通過，六月十五日，送到羅斯福那裏而被退囘。罷工的資任者，瑯璫入獄，並科罰金。這是彈壓法的目的。如在這法案上署名，便變成法律。即使不署名，祇要等到二十五日，也要變成法律「羅斯福考慮苒三，終於不署名而送還議會。議會立即苒加以表決通過。彈壓法成立了。他在這裏除了勞働者以外，又過到另一個敵人—議會。這使他大大地吃了一驚。而且因爲這已經成爲法律，所以與以前向政府衷示同情熊度的勞　綿同盟（AFL）及各業勞工聯合　（CIO）等，也不得不變成了對手，而陷於破目，這又是一個大的威脅。</p>
<p>同時，羅斯福又在議會中碰了一　釘子。有一件委任食糧調查良官臣斯泰，台維斯全權　理糧食　給價格統制的法案·（俗稱食糧獨裁　法案），羅斯福對此案表示反對，但議會不　他的反對而通過，這又是一個大打擊、議會的態度，始終和他搗蛋。提高農產物的價格，他們以爲不可在增了，而主張增加商品金融會社的貸借賞金限度。用這資金來充　農民的助成金。可是助成金沒有看見，所見到的　是黑板上的白字。將近成功的事情都要破壞，這也是很危除的地方。</p>
<p>在勞務動員的問題上·勞　動員局長官麥克那特那傢伙·隨便書麼時候都在嘮嘮叨叨着，一有所聞，便　咕着：一如　大家都去富兵，別的工作就不要做了一，於是近來打算使用婦孺。總之·他是一個無用的人。</p>
<p>華萊士與　斯內</p>
<p>最近的亭梨華雷期（戰爭經　委員長），和喬治瓊斯（復興金融局局長）的鬧意見。他並不作左右袒。據華萊士說：一麥克沃塞從菲　拿來二百萬匣金　納霜，沒有出錢，一據　斯說：一華萊士因爲要從加拿大收買酒精九萬加侖·所以往了七個月。一各翻醜史，弄得二敗俱傷，戰爭經濟委員會，復興金融局都完了。兩者合併爲一，設立戰爭經濟局，任命利盎克羅里（敵產管理局長官）爲長官，爭吵也吵不成軾了，</p>
<p>陷入泥淖不能自拔</p>
<p>美國自稱是「反軸心國的兵工廠，一其代價是勝利。現在都是放債出去的——其實這不過是過剩生產的尾　，是反軸心國的一服興奮劑。不知不覺地踏入一貨與」的泥淖中·拔不出腳來了。如其不貸與武器，反軸心的戰力就要大成，他用這樣恐嚇的語句宣傳着。然而不幸戰綫卻擴大起來。現在不再是貸與的問題了。羅斯福的虛榮心，在這裏把頭去同大石相撞了。</p>
<p>「仔細想來·那是　話、中國的空軍，全部是我們的。澳洲的防備全部由美國負担·北非。印度。以及歐洲上陸的軍隊之物的負担，約由美國交付於邱吉爾，西南太平洋正在大血戰，這些都不是別人的事。然而國內如何呢？大總統的投票？忘記了我以的的功勞了嗎？甚麼？五十三歲的卓別材與十八歲的姑娘第四次結婚？胡說。　！鬥爭，鬥爭！國內，國外，都需要鬥爭！」（翔：　自八月十五日「週刋朝日」）</p>

<h3 id="c33">如何厲行國民節約 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 周敏英</p>
<p>儉　節約，在中國　歷史　新的　德　　的如孔子的「君子　毋求安，食毋水飽」，　　武侯的</p>
<p>靜致遠，淡泊明志」，近的如　文止公，曾文正公，他們也都抱着爲國爲民的目的，不求一已的享受。海通之伊，因爲人口過剿，出國謀生者不下千萬人，華僑在世界各國獲得一致的令譽，生活最儉樸，辦事最動勞，甚至正因爲儉樸勤勞的緣故，大遭當地人氏的嫉　，美國的禁止華工進口，南洋英荷勝地的反對華僑，便都是因爲中國人太儉樸了太勤勞了。</p>
<p>同時國內大多數國民的生活，也非常刻苦，他們得到的微薄的收入，　到家中羅米買柴，僅能勉張維持殘命、　腥魚肉輕易不見而，討老婆的時候做幾件出客新衣，一直藏到送老，甚至還傳給兒子。這樣的　儉過日子，還要叫他們節約，實在有點近於殘忍。所以目前要講節約，以不應計對窮苦的大多數人，而應針對少之又少的　紳富買　人聞人之流，以令國四萬萬人來說，也計祗有四十萬人，以上混五百萬人來說，或許衹有五萬人，是絕對需要節約的因爲他們人數雖少　糜費戶是非常之大。</p>
<p>奢侈　　的由來　祇因虛榮的迷信，空處或　發戶一類的人物，企圖以　　來充實他的人生，　以經　　器　　　紙來　除他的寂寞，還有一種人　假　名義以「打秋風」，旗費雖鉅，却出在衆人。頭上，本人還可從中撈筆大財。所以奢侈靡費之事，不必宣傳，窮苦大衆們對之早巳極其嫉恨，而且影啓亂飛，訃聞亂發　薪水階段的人們早巳不勝重負，應酬不起了。</p>
<p>節約之舉，可謂無人反對，但空談理論，徒事宣傳，實勝無補實際，不如着重厲行，而厲行的辦法，如國民自治性質的種種「節約公約」，固能收效，但政府如能頒布一種條例。假定爲「戰時國民節約條例」，則其收效之鉅，當遠過於民間公約。因民間公約只能拘束少數自愛之士，亦常受環境引誘，時有動搖可能。若政府條例，則拘束力普遍而且持久，　時此種條，必一萬火衆所　護。且「國民節約條例」一旦頒布，大家的應酬負擔鬆一口氣，貪汚投機頹廢腐化等現象，更可去掉一個根水原因，亦是幫助國家民族的進步。</p>
<p>至於戰時節約條例之中，對祝　　月一類舉動，自應禁止，但碩德高　者，或五十六十七十以上之整　，可舉行簡單莊重之祝賀儀式，亦不必大張筵席，大肆舖張，以浪費金錢，其餘如喪事婚事　情等，亦應以茶點為最高尙，不得巳時始可舉行宴會，而關於宴會一項，更須有業密規定，例如客人不能准時赴宴，賓客隨從濫索飯資，皆爲　予糾正的　習。又宴會應規定中午不用酒。晚問用酒，應禁用洋酒，業有規定分量數目，禁用熊掌燕窩魚翅海參等等的所謂山珍海味，執行查察的責任最好付　憲警保甲及地方社團，舉行宴會並應責成酒菜　以先申報『違犯條例的均嚴予處罰，再關於送禮的事情，亦應以經濟實用偽主，力避虛耗浪費‘戰爭之時爲維持民食。增加糧產，鮮花的花籃花圈亦應禁止。至於銀盾錦屏　幛古玩之類，送禮者雖頗　苦心，接受者不過作爲陳設擺闊之用，却要付出一筆不小的力錢，自然也不合乎節約原理。</p>

<h3 id="c35">計劃進行中之禁絕煙賭運動　將發起大規模宣傳運動 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>各關係當局偽澈底維護本市治安，對於區內所有之非法組織。及各項非法營業，將採取積極辦法，逐步予以取締。據悉常局初步行動，將首先檢舉煙賭塲所，因此項塲所歹徒最易匿跡，市民每因賭負鉅款而幹不法行爲，故煙賭塲所之取締，實爲當前迫切需要。况各界現發起而約運動。杜絕煙賭，亦正符合　約之原則。現有關當局正在確立大規模之進行計劃，將先發起一廣大之宣傳運動，促使市民醒悟，然後再採嚴峻之手段，澈底剷除煙賭塲所。此項大規模之禁絕煙賭運動，下月初可望展開。</p>

<h3 id="c36">盛宴可恥 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>我們曾經說過：大家爲了喜慶，叙情議事等等，都用宴會方式表示聯歡與聚談，這在人生與友情意義，原是未可厚非的，但因大都市物質享受的便利，就漸漸流入奢糜豪華的舖張與擺闊的塲面，簡直是暴珍物質了。目前這種奢糜豪華的宴會，還在繼續發展着，這在戰時生活與節約消費而言，都是很不合理的現象。</p>
<p>喜慶固然不必舖張，叙情則淡食何傷，而議事更毋須宴會，尤共是公務機關以及政府官吏有關公務的議事接洽，無論官方酬酢或與民間聯絡，均不必盛宴，充其量用茶會方式彼此集會已足，以節公帑，本市方面希望市政機關與官史率先以身作則，除招待外賓外，不用盛宴，矯正奢糜風氣。</p>
<p>灰邦吉田氏的「宴會」一文，（載第四版指出案會中，主人成以爭邀名流與競炫盛宴爲鳴高，而被邀名流因此不能不動於訓練胃腑，以大部時間耗於酬酢，遂减少修養與工作時間，所以胃　營養過多，而頭腦養轉感不良，謂之令人　　。希望社會名流　盛　，更不赴無意義之宴會。</p>
<p>在此戰時，盼望大家都有一種觀念，主人以盛宴宴客爲可恥，賓客以出席盛宴爲可恥，如此相戒，不難形成節約宴會之良好風氣。</p>

<p>昨論如何保證資金安全，認爲投資於正當生產事業，乃爲保證資金安全之正路。茲論不當破壞產業安全，因有鑒於昨日報載「取締賣空投機」一文，裏尙所申引的，是一九三七年秋一個外國證券交易所委員會的一段報吿：『證券市塲的破　。原不足奇：股票商利用市塲心理虛弱時，乘機拋空，復於市價更　時補進　結，……此種行爲嗎實爲破　共和國之產業安全，應予嚴厲取締。」　段文字，適在當前大衆要求維持市塲的呼聲下予以提出，實在是有些耐人尋味的，</p>
<p>股票交易，原爲合法的買賣，更爲戰時各國所但願提倡，不願抑制的一種買賣，祇是積極提倡之中，須寓善良管理之意，所以本報社評前論『證券交易所復業問題』，認爲上塲股票固須經過嚴格之審查啊而股票業商投機操縱之風，尤不可長，即是此憲。</p>
<p>產業明明是安全的，責金投諸正當生產，也明明是安全的，假定有人利用疲弱的市塲，祗顧「渾水撈魚」，不惜　投井陷石」，共削弱生產界的財政信用尙事小，其影響金融界的周轉力量則事大。</p>

<p>本市各業同業公會，爲澈底抑平物價曁使商品疏通面滑起見，特籌設調查組及物資配給組，關於此二組設立之目的，前者爲調查各會員商店是否遵照各該業評價委員會核訂之價格出售商品，後者則爲提供各商店必需之物資，在如此恩威並施之下，衆倍對於壓平物價，其效是不在淺。</p>

<p>各公會　接各方面報吿。謂省該公會所屬之會員商店，每有超過限價情事，或竟藏貨拒售，冀希經營黑市，以牟暴利。各公會乃特設調查組，遴派幹員分赴各商店門市部密查，共調查對象，不外　各類門售物品價格是否遵照公會之限價，　是否拒絕出售物品　　是否將大宗物品售與黑市商人，　出售商品是否照章開給發票，　是否使用不合標準之度量衡器等，違者商號一經發覺，卽由調查員據情報吿公會，由公會依悄節輕重處罰，或報吿當局依法追究。</p>
<p>收買物資</p>

<h3 id="c48">宴會 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>我很同情上海的名流。聽說他們每天至少用中勝二次，晚餐三次，是以不能不動於訓練　腑。他們大部分的時問幾全消耗於宴曾與　會之問，而所費於精神的修養之時間，或听費於實際工作的時間極少，所以　腑的營養總嫌過多，而頭腦的營養則總感不良。</p>
<p>任何人都不會以爲這是件好的事情，郭沬若曾　：「茶樓酒館的害處，决不下於烟館。尤其如最近的情形，實會頓繁，且其費用實亦很浩大。普通一席菜，不出三十元的不足爲榮，諺云：「富人一席酒，窮人三年糧，」正是目前的你照，而且似乎有五相競爭的狀態。這種情形，對中國的前途實很危險。「郭沫若見到三十元一席的菜已經驚奇得如此，如其來到現在的上海，將爲之瞠目吧，像最近的上海，宴會之多，在中國的歷史上可說是破天荒。而即使在現在世外上的任何地方，恐怕也很少吧！</p>
<p>宴會者，集合多人而共食之謂，在中國，說到吃，的確比其他國家來得重視。林語堂在「吾國與吾民」一書中說：「中國人重視飲食的事實，可在各方面表現出來。翻閱紅樓夢及其他中國小說，林黛玉早餐用些什麼，　寳玉怎樣在夜半吃宵夜，菜單的說明極爲詳盡，而使人驚又。」我來上海後不久，到理髮店去，被問道：「晚飯用過了嗎？」關於理髮店與飯館的關係，我想了整晚。那時候我的結論，尙作這樣解釋：因爲中國資窮的人很多，在那天中能否有飯吃，是一個重要問題，因此，這話自然成爲日常的應酬時。就使在目前。相信　解釋也有若干眞理。但上海的宴會頻繁之理由，尤以最近的情形，不能用中國人對於食物有特別的嗜好膏或從　腑的容積等原因來說明　總而言之，上海的宴會的目的，以「社交」爲主。在最近的上海，這「社交」很有必要。有人以爲日本人與中國人之間，中國的商人與官吏之問，若沒有遺種「社交」就不能圓滿進行，故必先舉行宴會以聯格感情。有人希望與有權力的人交際，　　人的　引而提高其社會地位，也　行宴會以爲進身之階。在交易上及其他塲合，要想獲得那人的信用，就須先行招待。宴會席上多名流，是要使　方知道自已與名流交際，使對方信用自已。這種「社交」的或有作用的宴會甚多。因而主人不顧到客人胃腑的容　或酒菜的滋味，酒席唯求事奢，用電燈泡裝做眼珠的燒乳豬，以及盤的四周滿綴着電珠的油炸塊鷄等，這些東西雖與食慾的關係很遠，（尤其在日本人方面）但爲了表示酒席的豪奢起見，非此不可。據說最近備有高價洋酒的一席菜，無論如何須在一萬元以上。一萬元的現金，如善爲運用，大概可以很充裕地從　頭援救一百名餓斃者吧，現在的上海，費用一萬元的宴會，如以每天平約五十組計算，決不能說是過份。如其依此計算，每日節約五十萬元，則可以從街頭援救五千名餓斃老。</p>
<p>關於宴會一事，不能僅非難中國人，日本人的宴會漸漸地如此了。尤其在上海，大的日本菜錧均爲與食色兼有關係的塲所，不像中國那樣分別經營的。宴會的主人或客人中，亦有與侍候的「藝者」發生特殊關係的，宴會開始時頗爲正組，待酒至半酣，他們之間，猬　的談話漸次支配若宴會。在這種塲合，被招待的中國名流與非名流，他們的被招待，乃是叫他們在局促的狀態中是　他人所演的　態。</p>
<p>最近從日本內地來的某君，對上海的宴會之過多，表示憤慨，並說：　種事情如其被內地的人知道，將不勝憤慨。但表示憤慨的人，不僅是日本內地的人，在大東亞戰爭日趨激烈的今日，無論如何恐怕沒有舉行大宴會來討論東亞危機的必要。胃腑活　的時候，頭腦的活動即趨呆滯，此爲生理的原則。近來曾被招宴於符合此原則的宴會，很覺偷快。林康候，張一鵬，陳彬　三先生曾舉行第一區公署某長官的歡迎會、此次宴會從早晨八時開始，僅粥與醬菜四味。這樣簡單模索的宴會代替，奢的宴習，並不是壞事。</p>
<p>全上海現在被二種胃病困　着。其原因爲上流社會過食，而下　社會缺食。要啓冶這上海的胃病。應該請求種種措置。我希望下令取締上海的宴會爲其措置之一。（翔譯）</p>

<h3 id="e1">A New Assessment of the European Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the summer of this year, the world war situation has begun a new phase, mainly manifested in the Axis powers' adoption of a strategy of inducement on the Eastern Front of Europe, a "bleeding" strategy, the Soviet Red Army's passive offensive, and the Anglo-American-Canadian forces' landing in Sicily. This new shift in the military situation has attracted the attention of people around the world and the illusions of the anti-Axis powers. In Britain and the United States, even optimistic views about ending the European war by the end of this year prevailed. However, the actual development is still far from the ideals of the British and American rulers. Optimistic sentiments of a swift victory have gradually been shattered by reality. On the contrary, a new crisis is brewing among the anti-Axis powers.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the war situation on the Eastern Front of Europe, since the recent launch of the Soviet army's passive offensive, the German army has inflicted severe blows on the enemy troops one after another. They have shifted positions from Orel and Belgorod and other places, preparing to inflict heavier blows on the main force of the Red Army. According to German news from the day before yesterday, by the middle of July of this year, the German army had caused the Red Army to lose 1.5 million troops, of which 1 million were lost in winter operations and 500,000 in recent summer operations. This will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the future development of the war situation. On the Soviet side, there are many signs that indicate a truly desperate determination. For example, the recent changes in the personnel of the People's Committee for Foreign Affairs show that Molotov has shifted from diplomatic positions to fully preside over the political situation, allowing Stalin to devote his energy to directing operations. Current war reports can somewhat determine that the Soviet strategy is to "recover" the granary of Europe – Ukraine – at all costs. At the same time, the wars in the Leningrad region, Vyazma, Bryansk, and Smolensk regions, although harboring the ambition to seize Belarus and advance into the three Baltic countries, still have containment as their primary mission, given the strength of the Red Army. The battle for Kharkov is in full swing. At the same time, the German army and the Ukrainian volunteer army under German guidance have also begun to shoulder the task of the anti-Bolshevik war. The future of these battles will inevitably become the most important decisive force in the European war situation.</p>
<p>The war situation in Sicily has come to an end, but the political role of this battle is just beginning. Since the landing of the anti-Axis forces, although opinions from all sides are not entirely the same, the following facts cannot be ignored. First, the sudden resignation of former Italian Prime Minister Mussolini shocked people on all sides. In the past, we could say that from Italian domestic affairs to national defense, there were still some weaknesses. The Anglo-American forces, with their troops from North Africa, approached this isolated island, which inevitably had an impact on the Italian mainland. From the meeting between Xi and Mo to Mo's resignation, the military crisis was immediately transformed into political negotiation, actually buying time for the German-Italian alliance to complete the defense of Italy and the entire Southern European line. Now, Roosevelt has had to admit that he was tricked and has held the Quebec Conference. Second, the so-called "Second Front" issue has always been an obstacle to unity among the anti-Axis powers in the past two years. The inadequacy of the US and British war capabilities is the crux of the problem, but at the same time, the existence of contradictions between the US and Britain and the Soviet Union cannot be ignored. Britain's war aim is to maintain its imperialist hegemony in various parts of the world, while the United States, in addition to the same goals as Britain, also attempts to expand its imperialist rights and take over Britain's colonial rights. Whether it is the US or Britain, to achieve these ambitions, the enemies they encounter are not only the Axis powers but also their own partner – the Soviet Union. For this reason, since the war began, the strategy of the US and Britain has always been to preserve their own strength and sit on the sidelines, watching the mutual consumption of the German and Soviet war capabilities. Last year, when it was absolutely necessary, they landed in North Africa and, more than half a year later, landed in Sicily. The strategic direction of the US and Britain is very clear: one is to compete for hegemony in the Mediterranean, and the other is to gradually direct their military force towards the Soviet Union to prevent the Soviet army from advancing into Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. Of course, this is greatly contrary to the expectations of the Soviet Union. With the end of the Sicilian war, the one most concerned about the movements of the US and British forces is not Germany and Italy, but the Soviet Union. This further shows the development of contradictions between the political and strategic plans within the anti-Axis powers.</p>
<p>The new situation forces the anti-Axis authorities to have another meeting. A few days ago, Roosevelt and Churchill held a three-day meeting at Hyde Park in Canada. After that, Roosevelt returned to Washington on the 16th to convene a meeting of military and diplomatic leaders, while in Quebec, military leaders from Britain, the United States, and Canada are still in consultation. Churchill is still in Canada waiting for Roosevelt to meet again. The Soviet Union has officially stated that it has not been invited to participate and that there is no need to participate. However, according to news from Britain, the United States, and neutral countries, US Secretary of State Hull and British Foreign Secretary Eden will both travel to Moscow once the formal results of the meeting between the two giants Roosevelt and Churchill are known, or when a conclusion is reached. From these dispatches, one can see the seriousness of the contradictions among the anti-Axis powers and the divergence of views on future strategies. According to dispatches from neutral parties, it can be determined that the themes of this meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill are concentrated on: the political problems caused by the new situation in Italy, the political and strategic problems between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the future operational problems in Europe. Regarding the first issue, it has now been confirmed that the anti-Axis powers' peaceful offensive against Italy has completely failed. Not only is Italy more determined to unite with the Axis powers and persist in resistance, but also the "shift of neutral countries" that the US and Britain had fantasized about has actually been completely thwarted. Spain's steadfastness goes without saying, and Turkey's unwavering attitude has made the US and Britain feel particularly frustrated. Regarding the second issue, the Soviet Union's "victory" in its offensive actually threatens the US and Britain; and the Soviet Union's demand for the US and Britain to open a second front in Western Europe is something that the US and Britain dare not easily try. What the US and Britain are discussing today is nothing more than how to appease the Soviet Union, such as "air offensives against Germany" and the tragic bombing of Paris. As for attracting German troops to the Eastern Front, it can be said that the US and Britain are unwilling to do so. So, how many days can the exhausted Soviet Union's "offensive" last? Where can the cracks between the Soviet Union and the US and Britain be bridged by Hull and Eden? Regarding the third issue, the future strategic direction of the US and Britain can now be clearly seen. They will definitely not go beyond the scope of the Mediterranean. Perhaps, in coordination with the war situation, the political offensive against Turkey and the Balkan countries will be more actively promoted.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Europe, the decisive manifestation of the war is on the continent. The Anglo-American sea and land warfare tactics and air war absolutely do not have the power to determine the war situation. On the continent, Germany is still calmly striking back against the Soviet Union's unprecedented large-scale offensive that concentrates all its efforts. It goes without saying that they are even better prepared on the European continent. According to reports, there is talk that the military and diplomatic three-nation conference between Japan and Germany may be held in advance. We can wait and see the development of the new international situation.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) – Aoki Kazuo, Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry of Japan, arrived in the capital at 4:30 PM today on a special plane from Tokyo at 8:00 AM, accompanied by his staff, including Takeuchi, Director of the General Affairs Bureau, Imai, Councilor, secretaries Genmichi, Abiko, Ono, Hakodate, and Watanabe, investigators Tanioka and Otsuki, and administrative officer Hoshina, to investigate the situation in our country after the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China, and to pay respects to Chairman Wang and earnestly discuss matters with our government authorities. Foreign Minister Chu Minyi represented the National Government to welcome him at the Ming Palace Airport. Ministers and senior officials from various Yuan of the central government who were present to welcome him included Wen Zongyao, Mei Siping, Bao Wen-yue, Ren Yuandao, Chen Jun, Ding Mocun, Xia Qifeng, Li Shuyi, He Bingxian, Li Xuantiao, Chen Zhishuo, Zhou Naiwen, and Guo Xiufeng. On the Japanese side, there were Ambassador Tani, Major General Teraoka, Chief Kishijo of the Information Department, and representatives from the military, totaling about 100 people. The special plane circled north of Zijin Mountain at 4:15 PM and then landed at the airport. Chinese and Japanese military and civilian officials present to welcome him lined up in two rows. First, Foreign Minister Chu, representing the National Government, and Ambassador Tani, stepped forward to greet him. Minister Aoki and his staff, dressed in formal national attire, alighted from the plane amidst warm greetings. They shook hands with Foreign Minister Chu, Ambassador Tani, and the welcoming personnel one by one as a courtesy. Ministers and senior officials from various Yuan who were present to welcome him briefly exchanged pleasantries with champagne in the airport reception room. Minister Aoki and his staff then went to their residence to rest. At 5:30 PM, they met with reporters at Ambassador Tani's official residence. In addition to making a statement, he also shared his impressions of his visit to China with the reporters. The gist of his remarks was that during this stage of the East Asia War, he often thought of the great spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism was to liberate Greater East Asia from the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, and to make Asia the Asia of Asians. Now that the construction of Greater East Asia is gradually being completed, Dr. Sun Yat-sen also fully advocated the construction of China, which requires the abolition of all unequal treaties in China, the restoration of Chinese sovereignty, and the establishment of an independent and autonomous China. This grand ideal has also been gradually realized, thanks to the efforts of Chairman Wang and the leaders of the government, who have carried on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. The recovery of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights are examples of this gradual realization. If Dr. Sun Yat-sen had not died, how gratified he would have been to witness the flying of the blue sky with a white sun national flag over the concessions today. I am infinitely grateful for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's foresight and for this great ideal. Tomorrow morning, I will go to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum to pay my respects and express my long-standing admiration for Dr. Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>Statement to Reporters</p>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) – Aoki Kazuo, Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, met with Chinese and foreign reporters at the Japanese Embassy residence at 5:30 PM this afternoon and made the following statement: "I previously served in Nanjing until September of last year, but I left for home in October. It is a great pleasure to visit again after ten months. This visit to the Republic of China is to discuss matters with the National Government authorities, and to investigate the activities of Japan in China since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry. In addition, I will exchange views with the local Japanese army and navy authorities, and inspect the general situation after the implementation of the new policy towards China. Although the world situation has changed in the past year, the determination of our government to win the Greater East Asia War and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has become even stronger. To realize the liberation of East Asia and build a new order, it is imperative to strengthen the cooperation between China and Japan. Taking the National Government's participation in the war in January of this year as an opportunity, our country has clarified its fundamental policy of cooperating with China to complete its autonomy and independence, and assisting the National Government in its development, and is actively working to realize it. The policies of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights have been implemented one after another. From now on, we will further cooperate with China in its construction. Since the National Government declared war on Britain in January of this year, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, it has been increasingly diligent in governance to strengthen its political power, and has worked harder to encourage national spirit and increase production, so as to complete this common war in close cooperation with our country. This is truly what our country sincerely admires. The local Japanese army and navy, as well as our officials and people, can truly understand the government's policies and cooperate to concretely implement them, which is also deeply gratifying. On the occasion of my visit to China again, I sincerely hope that the Chinese and Japanese people will strengthen their ties for the sake of the future of Greater East Asia and work towards a common goal."</p>
<p>Impressions of Visiting China</p>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) – After Minister Aoki arrived in China,</p>
<p>Actively Assisting the National Government</p>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) – Aoki Kazuo, Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the head of the central government office in charge of diplomatic liaison with various countries in Greater East Asia, visited the rain-swept occupied territories in April this spring after the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, visiting Thailand, the Philippines, and Burma, and achieved further progress in completing the Greater East Asia War and uniting the East Asian peoples. On the 19th, he made a special trip to China to inspect various Japanese agencies in China and to earnestly discuss matters with our country's authorities. Aoki is a well-known figure in Japanese political circles, and he not only has an extreme understanding of our country's national conditions and the peace movement, but is also a strong advocate of actively assisting the National Government to strengthen itself. He has also made the greatest efforts to promote and develop the relationship between China and Japan, sharing life and death. In particular, during his tenure as the National Government's chief economic advisor, he made considerable efforts in the National Government's economic construction policies, leaving behind considerable achievements and giving the Chinese people a good impression. After taking office as Minister of Greater East Asia, he exerted his best efforts to implement the East Asia One Family policy, advocating a re-recognition of China. Therefore, the Japanese government and the public have implemented a new policy towards China. During this period, he guided the implementation of the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the implementation of taxation, and the return of the Shanghai Public Concession. Aoki has indeed made contributions. This time, his visit to China is welcomed by the government and the public. It is only natural that we deeply expect Aoki to use his consistent confidence and policy experience to conduct a detailed investigation of China's current situation. In particular, he should provide full assistance to the policies of economic reconstruction, so as to make further progress in the controlled economy and thoroughly promote the relationship between China and Japan, sharing life and death. In addition, Aoki's visit to China coincides with the return of the Shanghai Public Concession by friendly countries. The construction of Greater Shanghai in the future will depend on the cooperation of friendly countries. This point cannot but be expected of Minister Aoki.</p>

<p>Saigon, 19th (Central News Agency) – Based on the Japan-Vietnam Economic Agreement, the Japanese and Vietnamese authorities previously conducted negotiations and concluded the third annual Japan-Vietnam Economic Agreement and the Japan-Vietnam Goods Agreement. On August 19th at 12:15 PM, Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Yoshizawa and Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux held a signing ceremony at the Governor-General's residence in Saigon and exchanged documents related to Japanese goods imported to Vietnam and others. Thus, the implementation agreement of the third annual Japan-Vietnam economy was completely established. Those attending the signing ceremony on that day included Ambassador Yoshizawa, Minister Toshiro, Consul Watanabe from the Japanese side, Governor Decoux, Director of the Economic Bureau Martin, Director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau Bova-Satier, and Chief of the Secretariat Vallek from the Vietnamese side. After signing the agreement, both parties issued identical communiqués, the gist of which was that Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Yoshizawa and Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux signed the "Agreement on Japanese Goods Imported to Vietnam in Showa 18" at the Vietnamese Governor-General's residence on August 19th.

<p>Rangoon, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Burmese head of state, Ba Maw, has considered the nominee for the first Burmese ambassador to Japan.

<h3 id="e10">Minister Yanagi Published a Statement <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – When Roosevelt and Churchill held talks in Quebec, the Chongqing newspaper Central Daily News and the Ta Kung Pao published articles on the 17th, demanding that Britain and the United States should be grateful and reward the Chongqing regime for its six years of resistance. Today, Major General Yanagi, Director of the Army Press Department of the Imperial Headquarters, published a statement on the 18th, the gist of which was that such arguments by the Chongqing newspapers have nothing to do with Japan's thorough completion of the Greater East Asia War. Japan's national strength has been increasing day by day. The Japanese army is still exerting its strong combat power on the Pacific front and the Chinese mainland front. This is something that the Chongqing regime cannot but admit. The Chongqing regime's six years of resistance will not obtain any reward from Britain and the United States, but will only result in self-destruction. This is what I dare to say. This meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill in Quebec is only for the purpose of using a small amount of weapons by Britain and the United States to make the Soviet Union and the Chongqing regime make greater sacrifices again. If the rewards of the war are proportional to the contributions and efforts to the war, then the rewards obtained by the Chongqing regime are too small. This is already very clear. The people of the Chongqing regime should recognize this truth and no longer rely on Britain and the United States, making futile sacrifices. They must know that Britain and the United States only intend to enrich themselves. Therefore, for the sake of Asians, they should participate in today's Greater East Asia Liberation War and cooperate to destroy Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Roosevelt's Depression <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Hongyi Naganuma</p>
<p>Labor Strike Problem Reaches Stalemate</p>
<p>In April of this year, Roosevelt recklessly confronted John L. Lewis, the president of the coal miners' union. At the beginning, he did not intend to use high-pressure tactics, but unexpectedly encountered a formidable opponent. Roosevelt's enemy was not just Lewis; he was joined by 500,000 coal miners. Each day they did not work, the production of anthracite coal decreased by 2 million tons, and bituminous coal by 1.4 million tons. This strike was likely to spread and expand. Chrysler (automobile industry), Cleveland (transportation industry), Goodyear (rubber industry), Baltimore, Ohio (railroad), Detroit (automobile industry), Buffalo (rubber industry), Kentucky (iron industry), Philadelphia (aircraft parts), and other so-called "heart of the American military industry" areas were in turmoil, and the situation was quite serious. The problem was not just about coal. How is coal utilized? 20% of its total production is used for steelmaking, 17% for heating and other purposes, and 12% for power generation. The remaining 51% is used in industry. What is called industry today can be said to be another name for the military industry.</p>
<p>The cause of the dispute, needless to say, is the issue of wage increases. Relying on the circumstances of the war, even laborers could not directly say they wanted to stop the war, but without wage increases, they would not work. This was equivalent to not being able to wage war. So, what if wages were raised? Since the spring of this year, Roosevelt, gradually feeling the pinch of inflation, tried every possible way to prevent it, and on April 8, he established a comprehensive linkage method for wages, benefits, and prices. However, from the very beginning, he yielded to the miners, making it a complete mess. What could stimulate price increases more than this?</p>
<p>Roosevelt also thought of other things. "That Lewis fellow, what an annoying person! Wasn't he the one who cheered during my reelection campaign in 1936? To reward him, didn't I put all my effort into establishing the 40-hour workweek? But then, when the European war started, what did that guy say? Didn't he say he opposed the war? Then, during the third election campaign in 1940, he switched to the side of my enemy, Willkie. After I won the election, he resigned as the president of the CIO (Congress of Industrial Organizations), almost as if to show resentment. What is he doing this time? Standing in front of the coal miners and starting a strike!"</p>
<p>However, Roosevelt would not give up so easily. Should he use threats? Or soft persuasion? Roosevelt used both, but neither worked. "In May, I have other big problems. I have to bite the bullet before the end of May," so there was a ceasefire agreement from the 4th to the 15th, which was then extended for another 15 days, in the hope of getting through the end of May.</p>
<p>That May 41st was the day when the fifth Anglo-American conference was held in Washington. In the previous fourth and fifth conferences, Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek did not attend, which greatly diminished the significance of the meetings. From the 11th until the end of the conference, Roosevelt's activities can be described as very skillful.</p>
<p>Received a Setback in Congress</p>
<p>After the conference ended, a strike suddenly broke out. On June 8, Lewis and the United Mine Workers broke up. At this time, there was no reason for the American political circles to stand idly by. In this most intense time of the war, even if there were disputes, there should be no strikes. This kind of consideration for the situation was brewing within the Congress. So a bill to suppress strikes was passed in both the House and the Senate, and on June 15, it was sent to Roosevelt and returned. Those responsible for the strikes would be imprisoned and fined. This was the purpose of the suppression law. If he signed the bill, it would become law. Even if he did not sign it, it would become law on the 25th. "Roosevelt considered it again and again, and finally returned it to Congress unsigned. Congress immediately re-voted and passed it. The suppression law was established. Here, besides the workers, he gained another enemy—Congress. This greatly surprised him. Moreover, because it had become law, even the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which had previously shown sympathy to the government, had to become opponents, which was another big threat.</p>
<p>At the same time, Roosevelt also ran into another obstacle in Congress. There was a bill to entrust the food survey official, Davis, with full authority to manage food supply and price controls (commonly known as the "Food Dictatorship Act"). Roosevelt opposed this bill, but Congress passed it despite his opposition, which was another major blow. The attitude of Congress was consistently to make trouble for him. They thought that the price of agricultural products should not be increased any further and advocated increasing the lending limit of the Commodity Credit Corporation. This fund would be used to supplement subsidies for farmers. But subsidies were not seen; all that was seen was white characters on a blackboard. Things that were about to succeed were being ruined, which was also very dangerous.</p>
<p>On the issue of labor mobilization, McNutt, the Director of the War Manpower Commission, was always complaining. Whenever he heard something, he would grumble: "As if everyone is going to be soldiers, and no other work is to be done!" So recently, he was planning to use women and children. In short, he was a useless person.</p>
<p>Wallace and Jones</p>
<p>Recently, there was a dispute between Henry Wallace (Chairman of the War Production Board) and Jesse Jones (Director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation). He did not take sides. According to Wallace: "McCloy took two million boxes of quinine from the Philippines without paying for them." According to Jones: "Wallace went for seven months because he wanted to buy 90,000 gallons of alcohol from Canada." Each revealed the other's scandals, resulting in a lose-lose situation. The War Production Board and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation were both finished. The two were merged into one, and the War Production Board was established, with Leon Crowley (Director of the Alien Property Custodian) appointed as the director. There was no room for further disputes.</p>
<p>Unable to Extricate Himself from the Mire</p>
<p>The United States calls itself the "arsenal of democracy," and the price for that is victory. Now, it is all lending out—in fact, it is just the tail end of overproduction, a stimulant for the Allied nations. Unknowingly, it has stepped into the mire of "lending and giving," and cannot pull its feet out. He used such threatening language to promote that if weapons are not lent, the Axis powers would become too strong. However, unfortunately, the battle lines have expanded. Now, it is no longer a question of lending. Roosevelt's vanity here caused him to butt his head against a large stone.</p>
<p>"On closer thought, that's not right. The Chinese air force is all ours. The defense of Australia is entirely borne by the United States. The burden of North Africa, India, and the troops landing in Europe is also borne by the United States and handed over to Churchill. The Southwest Pacific is in a great battle. These are not other people's affairs. But what about domestically? The presidential vote? Have you forgotten my past achievements? What? Chaplin, at 53, is marrying an 18-year-old girl for the fourth time? Nonsense! Fight! Fight! Domestic and foreign, both need to fight!" (Excerpt from the August 15th issue of "Weekly Asahi")</p>
<h3 id="e12">Italy Announces the Course of the Sicilian Campaign <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) The Supreme Command of Italy issued a supplementary communiqué last night stating: Sicily has reached the inevitable end stage. The enemy's attack on the island began on July 10, with approximately 1,500 ships of various types, escorted by first-line battleships, attempting to land. Among them were three aircraft carriers, and numerous destroyers. One hundred cruisers. Swarms of dive bombers covered the light infantry. This massive force landed along the coasts of Licata and Syracuse. The fleets of the two most powerful nations in the world, supported by air forces concentrated in the Mediterranean, launched a fierce attack on Sicily. After an aerial bombardment that rained down like bullets, a large number of Allied ground troops gained a foothold on the island. American troops landed between Licata and Pozzallo, while British troops landed between Pachino and Syracuse. After the enemy landed, German and Italian forces achieved initial successes. However, due to the Allied naval and air superiority, the Axis forces were forced to retreat from the coast. After bombarding the lines of Trapani and Marsala, the invading forces simultaneously accelerated their landing. Their armed forces attacked Augusta from the coast and occupied the city on July 12. The Axis motorized units in central Sicily were unable to withstand the enemy's pressure, which was particularly intense in the Catania area. After a bloody battle on the 12th, the enemy occupied Agrigento, Caltanissetta, and the entire southern coast of Sicily. The city of Catania was still in a fierce battle. With the enemy advancing north from Agrigento in superior numbers, the Axis forces were forced to retreat and establish a new line in the north. This line ran through Castrogiovanni, Nicosia, Regalbuto, and to Catania, to prevent the enemy from operating in the northeast of the island. Thereafter, only localized battles occurred along this line, until the Allied forces disregarded the losses from Axis air strikes and completely landed their 15 divisions, and heavy artillery was transported. The British and American troops then began their attack on Messina. Catania was finally abandoned on August 5. Since then, the ferocity of the fighting has not stopped, but the Axis forces were ultimately able to withdraw from Sicily in an orderly manner, which should be noted. In this campaign, the Allied nations' losses were 45 merchant ships. Two destroyers. Eight cruisers. Three submarines. These were sunk in the Mediterranean, while 115 merchant ships, two aircraft carriers, and five cruisers were heavily damaged. This shows that the Allied forces suffered more losses than they gained.</p>

<p>Soviet Union's Cold Attitude Towards the Conference</p>
<p>Lausanne, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) Havas News Agency reports: "The Lausanne Gazette" correspondent in Ankara said that the Soviet Union holds an extremely cold attitude towards the Quebec conference, and the Soviet government does not attach importance to the development of the meeting. According to a commentary by the Soviet TASS news agency, if Britain and the United States fail to open a second front, they are not sincere in fighting together with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union's participation in the meeting must be after the formation of a united front. Otherwise, the Soviet Union considers all meetings to be unimportant, because the meetings cannot affect the Axis powers' war plans, nor can they determine the conditions for peace. Therefore, the Soviet Union does not intend to issue an official report on the Anglo-American conference.</p>

<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) According to Havas News Agency: In the Izyum area, the large-scale Soviet operation using tank wedge-shaped penetration tactics has failed. Despite using the manpower of eleven rifle divisions, the Soviets have failed to shake the German lines. The new offensive of the Soviet infantry, without the assistance of tanks, will still be hit hard and retreat. On Wednesday, the Soviet army launched a concentrated attack with 150 tanks. This unit was largely composed of those who had been repelled in previous days. After a fierce artillery barrage, the Soviet army attacked the German positions at 3 a.m., but was ultimately repelled. In the afternoon, the Soviet army continued its attack, but was still crushed by heavy artillery fire and counterattacks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) The German News Agency reports that the focus of the Eastern Front has once again shifted to the Belgorod area, where German infantry and tank units launched two successful counterattacks, capturing some valuable areas, thereby greatly improving their positions. Local gaps were immediately sealed when German reserves arrived. Between Vyazma and Yelnaya, powerful Soviet infantry and tank units attacked the vast front, but were blocked in fierce fighting and suffered heavy losses.</p>

<h3 id="e20">East Asian Writers' Conference Scheduled to Open on the 25th; Japanese Minister of Culture Takahashi Writes an Article Pointing Out the Profound Significance of This Conference <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) The second Greater East Asia Writers' Conference is currently being actively prepared by the Japan Literary Patriotic Association and other organizations and will officially open on the 25th of this month at the Imperial Theater here. Kenji Takahashi, the Minister of Culture of the Japanese Greater Politics Support Association, wrote an article entitled "Completing Thought" and published it in the Asahi Shimbun here, pointing out the significance of this conference and expressing great anticipation for its achievements. The gist of the article is as follows: East Asia is not only spiritually united, but also politically, diplomatically, militarily, and in other aspects. This concept is gradually becoming a reality. At this time, all East Asian peoples should further exert their common strength and rise up together to eliminate obstacles to the realization of the lofty ideal of East Asian unity in all aspects. "Without Japan, there is no Asia," is a fact recognized by Sun Yat-sen and the general public. Therefore, it is of profound significance and obvious goal that the writers of Greater East Asia, who bear the center of the cultural war, gather in the capital of Japan to jointly study the strategies for completing the Greater East Asia War. Making the Indian masses aware and rising up, Manchuria has already begun the great step of construction, and China has also participated in the war, while the treaty of alliance between Thailand and Japan is becoming increasingly strong. Burma has also become independent and declared war on Britain and the United States, and the Philippines is moving towards independence. Therefore, if India not only has patriots engaged in the independence movement, but also sends representatives from the country to participate, then this conference will not only become East Asian unity in name and in reality, but will also allow the Greater East Asia War to be completed ideologically. Due to China's participation in the war, the Allied forces have lost their will to fight and are on the verge of collapse. On the Indian side, under the leadership of the patriot Bose, an independent National Army has been formed. The day when this long-cherished wish of Burma is fulfilled. To awaken the Indian masses, it is only through the collective efforts of writers with a keen sense of feeling that we can live up to the significance of convening a writers' conference under this decisive battle. The cultural figures of the participating countries should thoroughly cooperate and cooperate with each other. Today, it is not enough to think that this passive attitude is sufficient. It is also necessary to ensure that the cultural war, which is related to the military war, does not fall behind the military war. Sometimes, it should open up the way before the military war and actively promote the implementation of strategies. Then this writers' conference will have a more profound significance.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Purchase of Gauze Will Be Implemented in the Near Future <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Business Control Committee Prepares to Reopen Gauze Registration</p>
<p>The Business Control Committee's office for purchasing gauze is scheduled to purchase gauze from merchants in the very near future, in accordance with the implementing regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan. All owners or occupants of gauze should submit "Sales Applications" to the Business Control Committee. Then, the Business Control Committee will inspect the applied cotton yarn and cotton cloth and pay according to the standard price of 10,000 yuan per bale of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn. Once the inspection is completed, the Business Control Committee will take custody of it. As for the amount to be paid to the seller, the Business Control Committee will decide it within five days after the inspection is completed and issue a special fixed-term deposit certificate issuance request to the Central Reserve Bank, and deliver a special fixed-term deposit certificate exchange certificate to the seller. According to people from the purchasing office, before the official purchase, cotton yarn and cotton cloth are generally prohibited from moving, concealing quantities, or changing property rights relations. However, gauze purchased and sold by entrusted institutions, gauze stored by retailers not exceeding one month's quantity of average retail sales in the first half of this year, and gauze stored by manufacturing factories not exceeding one month's quantity of average needs in the first half of this year are not subject to this restriction.</p>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association is fully responsible for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, and is about to begin implementing the purchase work. However, there is a considerable amount of unregistered cotton yarn and cloth in this city. In order to take care of merchants, the Ministry of Industry submitted a proposal that was passed by the Executive Yuan, limiting a period of 15 days to reopen the registration of cotton yarn and cloth. If unregistered gauze is discovered after the deadline, it will be confiscated in accordance with the law. The Business Control Committee is now preparing to reopen the registration of cotton yarn and cloth and will announce the scheduled reopening after receiving the order from the Executive Yuan and complete the registration within the 15-day period.</p>

The government authorities will also establish closer ties with the music circles and provide as much assistance as possible. Subsequently, the musicians successively expressed detailed opinions on the organization of the music circles and the issue of contact with the government, the issue of seeking national songs, the issue of improving music education in schools, and the issue of record manufacturing. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic, and everyone enjoyed tea and snacks and dispersed after 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e33">How to Vigorously Promote National Thrift <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Minying</p>
<p>Thrift, in Chinese history, is a traditional virtue. For example, Confucius said, "A gentleman does not seek comfort in dwelling, nor fullness in food." Zhuge Wuhou said, "Tranquility leads to far-reaching influence, and detachment clarifies ambition." In modern times, people like Zeng Wenzhenggong also embraced the goal of serving the country and the people, not seeking personal enjoyment. Since the opening of the sea, because the population was too large, no less than ten million people have gone abroad to seek a living. Overseas Chinese have gained consistent reputation in various countries around the world. They are the most thrifty in life and the most diligent in work. Even because of their thrift and diligence, they have been greatly envied by the locals. The United States' ban on the import of Chinese workers and the opposition of the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia to overseas Chinese are all because Chinese people are too thrifty and too diligent.</p>
<p>At the same time, the lives of the majority of the people in the country are also very arduous. The meager income they receive is used to buy rice and firewood at home, barely maintaining their lives. Fish and meat are rarely seen, and when they marry a wife, they make a few new clothes for the occasion, which they keep hidden until they die, and even pass them on to their sons. Asking them to be thrifty on such a frugal life is a bit close to cruel. Therefore, the current emphasis on thrift should not be aimed at the poor majority, but should be aimed at the very few gentry, wealthy businessmen, and celebrities. In terms of the 400 million people in the country, it may only be 400,000 people. In terms of more than 5 million people, perhaps only 50,000 people are absolutely in need of thrift because although they are small in number, the amount of waste is very large.</p>
<p>The origin of extravagance is only due to the superstition of vanity. Empty or nouveau riche types of people attempt to enrich their lives through luxury, or to dispel their loneliness through expensive utensils and paper. There is also a type of person who uses the name of "knocking on the autumn wind" under a false pretense. Although the expenses are huge, they are borne by everyone, and the person himself can make a fortune from it. Therefore, extravagance and waste do not need to be publicized. The poor masses have long been extremely jealous of them, and flying rumors and randomly issued obituaries have already made people in the salary stage unbearable and unable to cope with social engagements.</p>
<p>The act of thrift can be said to be unopposed, but empty talk of theory and mere publicity are actually useless. It is better to focus on vigorous implementation, and the methods of vigorous implementation, such as various "thrift covenants" with the nature of national autonomy, can indeed be effective. However, if the government can promulgate a type of ordinance, assuming it is the "Wartime National Thrift Ordinance," then its effect will be far greater than that of private covenants. This is because private covenants can only restrain a small number of self-respecting people, and are often tempted by the environment, with the possibility of wavering from time to time. If it is a government ordinance, then the binding force is universal and lasting. At the same time, this type of ordinance must be protected by the public. Moreover, once the "National Thrift Ordinance" is promulgated, everyone's burden of social engagements will be relieved, and phenomena such as corruption, speculation, decadence, and degeneration can be eliminated. It is also a root cause and helps the progress of the country and the nation.</p>
<p>As for the wartime thrift ordinance, actions such as celebrations and birthday parties should be prohibited. However, those with great virtue or those who are 56, 67, or 70 years old or older can hold simple and solemn celebratory ceremonies, but there is no need to hold large banquets and extravagant displays to waste money. Other things such as funerals, weddings, and love affairs should also use tea and refreshments as the most noble thing. Only when necessary can banquets be held, and there must be strict regulations regarding banquets. For example, guests are not allowed to arrive late for banquets, and guests and followers are not allowed to demand food costs. These are all bad habits that should be corrected. Also, banquets should stipulate that no alcohol is used at noon. When alcohol is used in the evening, foreign alcohol should be prohibited. There are regulations on the amount and quantity, and so-called delicacies such as bear paws, bird's nests, shark fins, and sea cucumbers should be prohibited. The responsibility for execution and inspection is best assigned to the military police, Baojia, and local community organizations. Holding banquets should also require the alcohol and dishes to be reported in advance. Violators of the regulations will be severely punished. Regarding the matter of giving gifts, it should also focus on economy and practicality, and avoid waste. During wartime, in order to maintain the people's food and increase food production, flower baskets and wreaths of flowers should also be prohibited. As for silver shields, brocade screens, calligraphy, and antiques, although the gift-givers put in a lot of effort, the recipients only use them for display and ostentation, but they have to pay a considerable amount of money, which is naturally not in line with the principles of thrift.</p>

<p>Since the Municipal Education Association needed a dedicated impoverished education fund, the donations have been exceptionally enthusiastic. Prior to receiving donations of 10,000 yuan each from Mr. He Zhuoxian and Mr. Xu Xiaochu, yesterday we received a donation of 10,000 yuan in national currency from Mayor Chen to help the poor, which is inspiring. In addition, Tang Shoumin, on behalf of the General Commercial Control Association, donated 10,000 yuan, and Zhang Sumin, on behalf of others, raised 1,800 yuan, all of which have been received successively. In addition to sending letters of thanks to the fundraising committee members, the association will also list the names in the newspaper to thank people from all walks of life who have enthusiastically donated.</p>
<h3 id="e35">The Planned Crackdown on Smoking and Gambling Activities Will Launch a Large-Scale Propaganda Campaign <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>To thoroughly maintain the public order of this city, the relevant authorities will take active measures to gradually crack down on all illegal organizations and various illegal businesses in the area. It is reported that the initial action of the authorities will be to first investigate smoking and gambling dens, because criminals can easily hide in these places. Citizens often commit illegal acts due to gambling debts. Therefore, the crackdown on smoking and gambling dens is an urgent need. Moreover, the thrift campaign currently launched by various circles to eliminate smoking and gambling is also in line with the principles of thrift. The relevant authorities are now establishing a large-scale implementation plan, which will first launch a broad propaganda campaign to awaken the citizens, and then take severe measures to completely eradicate smoking and gambling dens. This large-scale campaign to ban smoking and gambling is expected to begin early next month.</p>
<p>Short Comment</p>
<h3 id="e36">Extravagant Banquets Are Shameful <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>We have said that everyone uses banquets as a way to express joy, talk about feelings, discuss matters, etc., which is originally unobjectionable in terms of the meaning of life and friendship. However, due to the convenience of material enjoyment in large cities, it has gradually flowed into extravagance, luxurious displays, and ostentation, which is simply a waste of precious materials. At present, this kind of extravagant and luxurious banquet is still developing, which is a very unreasonable phenomenon in terms of wartime life and thrift consumption.</p>
<p>Celebrations do not have to be extravagant, light food does no harm to expressing feelings, and discussions do not require banquets. Especially for public affairs discussions and negotiations by government agencies and government officials, whether official entertainment or contact with the people, there is no need for extravagant banquets. At most, a tea party is sufficient for people to gather together to save public funds. In this city, we hope that municipal agencies and officials will take the lead in setting an example, and will not use extravagant banquets except for entertaining foreign guests, so as to correct the extravagant atmosphere.</p>
<p>Mr. Yoshida of the Ash Gang's article "Banquet" (published in the fourth edition) pointed out that in banquets, the host strives to invite celebrities and compete to show off extravagant banquets, which makes the invited celebrities have to train their stomachs and spend most of their time on entertainment, thus reducing the time for cultivation and work. Therefore, the stomach feels over-nourished, while the brain feels poorly nourished, which is said to be disgusting. It is hoped that social celebrities will reject extravagant banquets and not attend meaningless banquets.</p>
<p>In this wartime, it is hoped that everyone will have a concept that the host should be ashamed of hosting extravagant banquets, and the guests should be ashamed of attending extravagant banquets. By warning each other in this way, it will not be difficult to form a good atmosphere of thrifty banquets.</p>

However, I was humiliated by my friends, who all believed that my mother was healthy at an old age and should be congratulated. They gave gifts one after another, and I repeatedly declined, but I couldn't refuse. Therefore, I had to prepare a little drink on that day to express my gratitude. Now, I will donate all the birthday gifts to various charitable organizations to replace the good fortune of my relatives and friends. Your newspaper's scholarship should receive 1,000 yuan in savings certificates from this donation. I am enclosing it with this letter, and I hope you will accept it."

<h3 id="e43">Improperly Destroying Industrial Security <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's discussion on how to ensure the safety of funds argued that investing in legitimate production ventures is the correct path to safeguarding capital. Today, we address the issue of improperly undermining industrial security, prompted by a report in yesterday's paper titled "Banning Short Selling Speculation." The article quoted a passage from a 1937 autumn report by a foreign stock exchange committee: "The collapse of the securities market is not surprising. Stockbrokers, exploiting the market's psychological weakness, seize the opportunity to sell short and then buy back to close their positions when prices fall further… Such behavior genuinely undermines the industrial security of the republic and should be strictly prohibited." This passage, presented amidst the current public demand for market stability, is indeed thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Stock trading is inherently a legitimate business and a form of commerce that countries at war prefer to promote rather than suppress. However, active promotion must be accompanied by sound management. Therefore, in our previous editorial on "The Resumption of the Stock Exchange," we emphasized that listed stocks must undergo rigorous scrutiny, and the speculative and manipulative practices of stockbrokers must be curtailed.</p>
<p>Industry is clearly secure, and investing funds in legitimate production is also clearly secure. Assuming that someone exploits a weak market, caring only to "fish in troubled waters" and not hesitating to "throw stones down the well," weakening the financial credit of the production sector is a minor matter; its impact on the circulation of financial forces is significant.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Various Trade Associations Thoroughly Suppress Price Hikes; Investigation and Rationing Groups Proceed in Tandem <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>To thoroughly suppress price increases and facilitate the smooth flow of goods, the city's various trade associations have established an investigation group and a material rationing group. The former aims to investigate whether member shops are selling goods in accordance with the prices approved by the respective industry price evaluation committees, while the latter aims to provide shops with essential materials. Under such a combination of carrot and stick, the effect on suppressing prices is undoubtedly profound.</p>
<p>Dispatching Secret Investigators</p>
<p>Various associations have received reports from various sources stating that member shops often exceed price limits or even hoard goods, refusing to sell in the hope of operating on the black market to reap exorbitant profits. Therefore, each association has set up an investigation group, selecting cadres to secretly investigate the sales departments of various shops. The objects of investigation are nothing more than: whether the prices of various retail items comply with the association's price limits; whether shops refuse to sell goods; whether shops sell bulk goods to black market merchants; whether shops issue invoices in accordance with regulations; whether shops use substandard weights and measures, etc. Once a violating business is discovered, the investigator will report the information to the association, which will punish the business according to the severity of the violation, or report it to the authorities for legal action.</p>
<p>Purchasing Materials</p>
<p>Recognizing the recent shortage of materials, and that it is both difficult and costly for shops to purchase on their own, the various associations have established a material rationing group. The associations will request assistance from the authorities to purchase materials in bulk from various production areas and then distribute them to their members. However, since the scale of member shops varies, as does the quantity of materials needed, each association will first divide its members into several levels and then distribute the materials proportionally. However, shops that receive materials must absolutely comply with price limits for their finished products and sell them entirely to legitimate users; otherwise, their rationing rights will be revoked.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Jiangsu Province Bans the Export of Rapeseed <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food approved a request from the Jiangsu Provincial Government. According to a report from the Provincial Grain Bureau, the people of the Suwu and Gu counties in Jiangsu Province mostly consume rapeseed oil, but the raw material, rapeseed, is not widely grown, being limited to Changshu, Wuxian, Wujiang, Qingpu, and other counties. Annual production is only about 400,000 shi, while the people need over 500,000 shi annually, relying on imports from Tiehu Lake to make up the difference. This year, excessive rainfall reduced the harvest, and transportation from Wuhu is inconvenient, cutting off the supply. This imbalance between supply and demand has led to a gradual increase in rapeseed prices recently, causing serious concern for the people's food supply. The Bureau immediately reported to the Provincial Governor and directed that all rapeseed produced this year should be used to meet the needs of the province first, and no exports should be allowed. This order was immediately distributed to the subordinate counties and the Miscellaneous Grains Association for compliance. Coordination was also achieved with the Japanese Consulate in Suzhou, and the matter was submitted for review and action. After investigation, rapeseed is the main raw material for making edible oil. Jiangsu Province produces too little locally and relies on imports from other ports. Since imports are now facing difficulties, it is necessary to prioritize the local rapeseed production to meet the province's needs and temporarily ban the export of rapeseed. In addition to sending a letter to the Japanese Embassy to instruct consulates in the above areas to prevent overseas merchants from transporting the product, rapeseed, as a major raw material for edible oil, should be assisted in maintaining the local food supply. Therefore, a separate order was issued to the Edible Oil Federation, instructing all district trade associations to comply.</p>
<p>Chinese Stock Market Trends</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks suffered a sudden and sharp decline, and the support for the situation over the past two days was once again unsustainable. In terms of news, there are countless rumors, such as new restrictions on the financial front, which are purely speculative. Although certain rumors often stimulate the declining confidence of all parties, causing various stocks to rise momentarily, the tightness of credit remains difficult to alleviate, ultimately forcing sellers to seek cash, making it difficult to rally in the short term. The textile industry is particularly related to cotton yarn and has suffered a sharper decline. Wing On Textile experienced another wild plunge, briefly entering the closed zone, while Sincere fell close to the major barrier. Smaller stocks such as Meya, Five Harmony, Ansheng, and Great China Weaving all saw limited demand, leading to a sell-off. Dasheng's factories One, Three, and Two also fell close to the barrier. In the department store sector, Wing On Company fell into the major barrier, while China Products retreated to the barrier entrance, each falling further. Sincere and China Underwear's capital increase has not yet opened. Jingfu Hosiery retreated to the barrier entrance and then rebounded, while Jinglun still had no buyers bidding. In the pharmaceutical industry, Sinya Pharmaceutical Factory retreated and approached the closed zone at noon, but saw buyers return in the afternoon. French broke through the barrier entrance and retreated close to the zone. Zhonglian and Xin Xing Pharmaceutical Factory, and Science &amp; Chemical Industry all saw declines. In the public utility sector, Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity and China Electric both saw declines. Public Utility Appliances opened, while Shanghai Tricycle and Xiang Sheng were both sluggish. The cultural industry also saw a significant decline, with Commercial Press plunging sharply, China falling into the major barrier, World also declining, Yongxiang Printing, Yizhi Softening, and Standard Paper Goods were uniquely stable with small declines. Nanyang Tobacco and Great China Huorong were both reduced, while Kangyuan Confectionery retreated to the major barrier. Maying Canned Foods and Guanshengyuan were weak and listless. Industrial stocks Xinghua and Great China Industrial collapsed, while Sinya Construction unexpectedly retreated close to the barrier. The real estate industry also proved unsustainable, with Lianhua and Jianyi Properties being sluggish, as was Meining, and other stocks all declined. New stocks in particular lacked support.</p>
<p>Commercial Summary</p>
<p>Public Bonds - The market briefly rallied yesterday, but due to credit conditions, it remained unable to rise. Grade C initially rose but then fell back in the afternoon, ultimately ending at the same price as the previous day. Grades A, B, D, and E were all slightly softer than the previous day.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities - The decline was even sharper. Even with low prices, there was little market interest. Phoenix Matches had retreated to the major barrier, and soaps also saw significant declines. 洋燭 candles experienced a weaker decline due to depleted inventory, but there were also few transactions.</p>
<p>Tea - Although there was some interest in red tea core from the New Asia Pharmaceutical Chemical Factory, buyers were generally seeking to push prices down, while sellers were unwilling to concede too much, resulting in slow transactions. Sales in various shops remained sluggish, and the market remained stable, with no significant gains or losses. Total city transactions were priced at over the major barrier per dan. At the same time, fourteen packages of graded tea were absorbed by the Liang Taihe and Hongji tea shops, sold by the Xie Fenglixing and other tea firms.</p>
<p>Activities of Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Insurance Brokers Association has been appointed by the Insurance Supervisory Bureau and has begun preparations. The first preparatory meeting was held on the 14th of this month, and the draft articles of association have also been drafted. The temporary preparatory office is temporarily located at Room 417, 4th Floor, No. 160, Edward Road. It is also reported that the second preparatory meeting is scheduled to be convened today.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Edible Oil and Vegetable Association and the Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association have both been formally established and have begun operations. The registration of member firms has also been completed, and membership certificates have been filled out and should be distributed in the near future. Thereafter, firms without certificates will not be allowed to operate the above-mentioned industries in order to comply with the law.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Auction Association has completed its preparations and convened its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from various Chinese and Japanese organizations attended to give guidance. Mr. Chen Fukang presided over the meeting and reported on the preparatory process. Directors and supervisors were then elected, and Mr. Chen Fukang was publicly elected as the chairman.</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Oil and Grain Special Committee Investigates the Quantity and Price of Edible Oil <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>To accurately understand the potential purchase volume and current potential purchase prices of edible oil in various regions, for reference in formulating capital plans and rationing plans, the Oil and Grain Special Committee has specially prepared an investigation form. It requests the Edible Oil Federations in various regions to promptly distribute it to the trade associations in their respective districts for detailed and accurate completion and submission to the Committee by the end of August for review. The form is divided into peanut oil, rapeseed oil, various soybean oils, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, etc., specifying the potential purchase volume and purchase price for the period from August of this year to May of the 33rd year of the Republic.</p>

<p>The Material Investigation Committee, led by Chinese and Japanese investigators, has been conducting investigations into the cotton yarn and cloth stored in the warehouses of the city. It has now completed the investigation of 247 commercial warehouses in the First and Eighth Districts. Among the 334 private warehouses in the two districts, the cotton yarn and cloth in 78 warehouses in the First District have been investigated. All 254 warehouses in the Eighth District will be completed in the shortest possible time. At its third committee meeting at 3:00 PM today (20th), the committee will discuss the illegally hoarded goods and owners discovered in order to formulate appropriate measures.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Banquets <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyu</p>
<p>I sympathize with the celebrities of Shanghai. I hear they have at least two Chinese-style lunches and three dinners every day, so they have to constantly train their stomachs. Most of their time is spent on banquets and social gatherings, leaving very little time for spiritual cultivation or practical work. Therefore, their stomachs are always overnourished, while their minds are always undernourished.</p>
<p>No one would consider this a good thing. Guo Moruo once said: "The harm of teahouses and restaurants is no less than that of opium dens. Especially in the current situation, they are becoming increasingly frequent, and the expenses are also very high. An ordinary meal of less than thirty yuan is not considered honorable. As the saying goes, 'A rich man's feast is a poor man's grain for three years,' which is exactly the current situation, and there seems to be a state of competitive extravagance. This situation is very dangerous for China's future." Guo Moruo was already so surprised by a thirty-yuan meal. If he came to Shanghai today, he would be astonished. Like the recent Shanghai, the number of banquets is unprecedented in Chinese history. And even in any place in the world today, it is probably rare!</p>
<p>A banquet is a gathering of many people to eat together. In China, eating is indeed more important than in other countries. Lin Yutang said in his book "My Country and My People": "The Chinese emphasis on diet is manifested in all aspects. Browsing through Dream of the Red Chamber and other Chinese novels, what Lin Daiyu eats for breakfast and how Jia Baoyu eats late-night snacks are described in great detail, which is both surprising and delightful." Shortly after I came to Shanghai, I went to a barber shop and was asked, "Have you had dinner yet?" I thought about the relationship between the barber shop and the restaurant all night. At that time, my conclusion was that because there are many poor people in China, whether they can have a meal that day is an important issue, so this sentence naturally becomes a common greeting. Even now, I believe this explanation has some truth. However, the frequent banquets in Shanghai, especially in the recent situation, cannot be explained by the Chinese people's special preference for food or the capacity of their stomachs. In short, the purpose of banquets in Shanghai is mainly for "socializing." In recent Shanghai, this "socializing" is very necessary. Some people believe that without this kind of "socializing," the relationship between Japanese and Chinese people, and between Chinese merchants and officials, cannot proceed smoothly, so banquets must be held first to foster relationships. Some people hope to associate with powerful people, attract the attention of important figures, and improve their social status, so they also hold banquets to advance their careers. In transactions and other situations, if you want to gain the trust of that person, you must first entertain them. Banquets are attended by many celebrities, which is to let the other party know that they are associating with celebrities, so that the other party trusts them. There are many such "social" or purposeful banquets. Therefore, the host disregards the guests' stomach capacity or the taste of the food and wine, and the banquet only seeks extravagance. Roasted suckling pigs with light bulbs as eyes, and fried chicken nuggets with electric beads around the plate, are things that have little to do with appetite (especially for the Japanese), but are necessary to show the extravagance of the banquet. It is said that recently, a meal with expensive foreign wines must cost more than 10,000 yuan. Ten thousand yuan in cash, if used well, could probably adequately rescue a hundred starving people. In present-day Shanghai, a banquet costing 10,000 yuan is not an exaggeration if calculated at an average of fifty sets per day. If 500,000 yuan is saved every day according to this calculation, it can rescue 5,000 starving old people from the streets.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of banquets, one cannot simply criticize the Chinese. Japanese banquets are gradually becoming like this. Especially in Shanghai, large Japanese restaurants are places that are related to both food and sex, unlike the separate operations of Chinese restaurants. Among the hosts or guests of the banquet, there are also those who have special relationships with the "geishas" who serve them. The banquet starts quite formally, but when the wine is half drunk, the lewd conversations between them gradually dominate the banquet. In such situations, the invited Chinese celebrities and non-celebrities are invited to watch others act out a farce in an awkward state.</p>
<p>Recently, someone from the Japanese mainland expressed indignation at the excessive number of banquets in Shanghai, and said: If such things are known to the people in the mainland, they will be indignant. But the people who express indignation are not only the people in the Japanese mainland. In today's increasingly fierce Greater East Asia War, there is probably no need to hold large banquets to discuss the East Asian crisis. When the stomach is active, the brain activity becomes sluggish, which is a physiological principle. Recently, I was invited to a banquet that conformed to this principle, and I felt very happy. Mr. Lin Kanghou, Zhang Yipeng, and Chen Bin held a welcome meeting for a certain chief officer of the First District Public Office. This banquet started at eight o'clock in the morning and consisted only of porridge and four dishes of pickles. Replacing extravagant banquets with such simple and frugal banquets is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>All of Shanghai is now troubled by two kinds of stomach problems. The reason is that the upper class overeats, while the lower class lacks food. To cure this stomach problem in Shanghai, various measures should be requested. I hope that ordering the prohibition of banquets in Shanghai is one of the measures. (Translated by Xiang)</p>

<h3 id="e51">A Visit to the Sacred Heart Convent in Yangjingbang (2) <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>A Paradise for Mixed-Race Orphans</p>
<p>The largest section of the Sacred Heart Convent in Yangjingbang is occupied by the "Poor Orphan Children's Education Institute." Early in the morning, the girls were already strolling and playing in the courtyard. The smallest were less than one-third of a meter tall, while the oldest were seventeen or eighteen years old. With a call from the nuns, they immediately ran over and surrounded the reporter. Their appearances and complexions were all different: African Negroes, American Indians, Spanish, Portuguese, Russians, Caucasians, and Turks, Indians, and Chinese from across Asia. It was truly a global gathering of girls. The nuns said there were originally thirty-one different nationalities, but excluding the poor orphan girls of enemy nationalities such as England, America, the Netherlands, and Belgium, who were already in concentration camps, there were now over thirty people, all of mixed race. Among them were three Chinese-Italian mixed-race Tang sisters, whose father sacrificed himself in the war. Their loving mother could not bear the burden of the whole family, so fortunately, the Sacred Heart Convent took them in. They wore identical clothes, joyfully shook the reporter's hand, and spoke with extreme innocence, completely unaware of the world outside the convent. Although the children had different bloodlines, they all understood French, English, and Chinese. Under the care of the nuns, their "common mothers!", they were lively, cheerful, and loving to each other. The nuns' affectionate treatment of them was enviable. They had their own bedrooms, occupying the three large rooms on the third floor. Each had their own iron bed and bedding, washing area, and wardrobe, all with designated names. These were all leftover from the old days. Recently, due to limited funding, fewer new ones have been added. However, because they are careful with washing and mending, and tailoring them to fit, they all look like daughters of wealthy families. They also have twelve cold and hot water baths, as well as a laundry room equipped with a disinfecting steam machine. The equipment on the playground is also quite complete. In the rainy day recreation area, there are also various toys and books. Most of the food is obtained by the nuns soliciting donations from various small vegetable markets. The kitchen was filled with fragrant smells, already preparing lunch. The children also helped with the work, practicing cooking. However, rice and bread often caused panic. Because the nuns suffer as much as the children, they are still very harmonious in spirit. They divide the children into classes for education. From elementary to junior high school, they have classes for six hours each day, with subjects such as Mandarin, English, commerce, and general knowledge. In the industrial arts area, there is typing, art, sewing, cooking, etc. Although it is currently summer vacation, the older children are unwilling to waste their time. After nine o'clock, they are already busy with their studies and work.</p>
