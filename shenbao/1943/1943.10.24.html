<p>星期評論</p>
<h3 id="c1">答悲觀論者 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田東祕</p>
<p>自從巴特里奧投降，以及德國在東綫上的撤退以來，不必諱言的，一部份中國人當中，悲觀論在發展着，例如他們在開始懷疑：德國也不久將走上意大利的同一命運吧！如果成為事實，那末處於大東亞地區的日本和南京政府，將碰到空前的困難吧！這種觀察是否正確，因關係日本及中國的命運非常重大，所以無論如何都有澈底回答的必要。正如過去所解釋的一樣，巴特里奧的投降，結果是淸除了軸心陣營中的機會主義者，情勢反而對於軸心有利，或說德國的戰略地位「是絕對不敗」的，這類說明，我認為不能充分說服悲觀論者，我以前每次碰到這類悲觀論者的時候，總是提出這樣反問來：姑且假定你的觀察是正確的，但在德意失敗後，必須要承認，對於蘇聯勢力侵入歐洲的强而有力之圍牆，完全沒有了。司時還要承認，抑制歐洲大陸各國的自由主義和共產主義的壓力，突然消滅了。如是，歐洲大陸上，潛伏在德意兩國的自由主義和共產主義，將如何勃興不必說，就是潛伏在法國，西班牙等國家的自由主義和共產主義，也會像雨後春　似地突飛猛進起來，於是便造成祕適合於蘇聯侵入歐洲的形勢。假如對於蘇聯勢力的向西發展，沒有了任何阻撓，那末就不難想像到：隨着德意的失敗同時，而在歐洲便掀起共產主義革命的高潮。因此，假如英美擊潰德意，那末歐洲問題就休想解決了。再者，德意崩潰後，歐洲共產主義化的火燄，恐怕將引起英美國內的自由主義和共產主義之勃興，於是就會威脅到目前在進行戰爭的英美統治階級之地位。那末英美縱令擊　德意兩國，但他們不僅從歐洲泥沼裹拔不出腳來，却愈陷愈深。即使英美把歐洲問題「解決」了，但在那種情形下，倒莫如說，歐洲問題把英美「解決」了。這樣說起來，那末「解決歐洲問題後，用全力攻擊日本」，這更是無稽之談了。因此，大東亞戰爭決不因歐洲問題的「解決」而受到決定性的影響。</p>
<p>神經過敏的悲觀論者，對於我這個說法，也許會提出一個反問來：「德意失敗後，如英美與蘇聯間能對歐洲問題妥協，那末英美九不是可以用全部力量攻擊日本了麼？」這話誠然是對的·英美與蘇聯間，單就歐洲問題妥協，也可以說，並不是絕對不可能的。但英美與蘇聯間的眞正妥協，就是現在也是不可能的，何况在那種情况上，豈不是更加困難麼？關於悲觀論者的反問，下列三點，就是適常的回答。</p>
<p>縱或蘇聯本身能答應不侵入歐洲，但並沒有禁止在歐洲傳佈共產主義思想的意志。</p>
<p>蘇聯並沒有幫助英美鎮壓在在歐洲各國內部自然發生的共產主義浪潮的意志。</p>
<p>德意失敗後，蘇聯並不是那樣高枕無憂，而不知道世界上誰是自己的最大敵人。</p>
<p>當然還有不滿意這三點說明，而主張英美會全力進攻日本的論調之懷疑論者。好，退一步來說，姑且承認這個假定：英美「解決」歐洲問題後，英美用全部力量進攻亞洲。縱使在這種情形上，我仍然敢斷言，大東亞戰爭並不會受到決定性的影響。我道個論斷，怎樣才可能呢？的確我們不能否認美國的龐大生產力，特別我們不能否認美國的龐大飛機生產力，終將在太平洋戰局上發揮威力。假如英美罄共所有飛機，在大東亞展開大攻勢，其威力誠然是可怕的。在歐洲戰塲上業已經騐過了，似乎今後的問題是空戰。以前一般人說，飛機對於戰爭，並不能有決定力。然而如看一下有一千架飛機的大編隊天天來空襲，能投下一千噸以上炸彈的近代空戰的形相，那末說道個飛機不能決定戰爭的親念，似乎業已達到不能成立的時期了。的確不能不承認，在歐洲，飛機會達到具有某種程度的決定力。如此論來，在大東亞戰爭當中，也可以說相同麼？不待言，日木與美國將有一個太平洋。即以最近飛機工業的發達而論，在戰略上克服這個距離，仍然還是相當困難的。同時，美國即使想空襲日本，但在日本附近物色到能起飛大規模飛機編隊的適當陸上根據地，倒也不是一舉手一投足的容易事。用航空母艦起飛飛機，這無論在數量上，或在炸彈載重量上，都有共限度，所以像歌洲戰塲那樣，對日本本土實行大規模的攻勢，我認為無論如何是不可能的。自　，利用中國大陸作根據地，是可以辦到的，但必須要知道，從重慶方面組織大機羣空襲日本，恐怕在途中將犧牲三分之一的實力。個如飛機沒有襲擊日本的決定力，則海陸軍更將沒有襲擊日本的決定力。因此，縱令英美用全副精神攻擊日本，但能迅速決定大東亞戰爭程度的武力，也不能集中起來。當然，日本到美國的距離，和美國到日本的距離，是一樣逺的，所以日本想迅速解決英美，這種可能的特別理由也沒有。大東亞戰爭，在開戰當初，日本國民早已認為是曠古未有的偉大長期戰爭，經過二年艱苦作戰的今天，愈益證明其為顛撲不滅的眞理。總之，　管最近歐洲戰局的如何發展，並沒有充分理由可以斷言，將對亞洲戰局以決定性的影響。悲觀論者對於現在世界形勢分析，完全是閉門造車式的杜撰，顯然是接受了所謂「抗戰八股」的影響。</p>

<h3 id="c4">天羽總裁談話 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日情報局天羽總裁於日政府拿腮自由印度臨時政府援發表談懸如次：</p>
<p>自由印度臨時政府然於十月二十二日誕生，印度之獨立乃全印　眾之夙願，亦世界各無之所期。終今久呻吟於無英毆通榨取下之緬甸巳　圈立，被造帝國主義壓那，其　有民族持性而不得發楊之菲偉賓侮亦已以東釀之一國毅然誕生，今加以自由印度臨時政府之成立，乃益增其光彩。</p>
<p>英國對印榨取壓迫</p>
<p>英國自勢十七世紀初伸其侵略魔手於印，以印度人之　血果其　嘆。然印度人夕間他漸釀成反抗氣勢，認俄戰爭以來其爭取獨立之心乃益烈。第一次世界大戰時，英故府即以戰熒給輿印度自治權為餌，以圖盡其所欲利用印度之入物資源，而戰筏英闈不但未曾麗行約言，目反施以　度壓迫。數千名，迄此次大戰英國對印之滕追愈形加重，徵發印人縣其立於最前終，根據本年六月英政府發表之數字，開戰以來英帝　兵員損失五十萬，其中印度軍之扒失佔十分之二，魏十萬人之多。又因軍贊負擔過重及供給人眾軍需物資，致仲現在之印度向鈴惡性通貨膨脹及嚴重之物資不足苦惱中。</p>
<p>施行暴政造威飢荒</p>
<p>且目下孟加拉省因英國之　政，已引起所謂人爲饑荒，飢斃者日益增多，此種悲慘消息，亦可屢見於英美方而之報道，已形成英議會之重要問題。英國之對印壓迫近益強化去年八月以來其勢愈形　著，成為英美戰爭目的之所謂大四洋　章，其中雖明言有民族自決之原則，而印度則不適用。英美之　瞞政策至此可謂暴露無遺。在此情況下。印度之自由決無自英國獲得之望，除以武力由印度　出英國勢力之外，實無他途，此已為夭下志士所共憤。</p>
<p>爭取獨立努力奮腳</p>
<p>江特拉鮑斯向即為印度獨立無奮國之志士，前年在印度設英國官絛逮捕後，印度民素當即全部罷市以示反抗。其後彼舞群赴雜國，埋首救國之難，今年六月來日，復赴南方·此後強化印度謬立聯盟線皺印度同民軍，積梯邁進獨立遝動，今則中機咸細，自由印度臨時政府終告誕　，此政府不但為協當爭求獨立之政拼，且負有印度夕正解放復發展為正式印度政府之篠命。印度國民軍乃同充謬獨立熱意及以身飾國快響之靑年印度人所相戲，此等軍絲開始奔向祖網盆勸解放進擊時。亦卻全霧度掙脫英國世紀之　　。而得解放之時。</p>
<p>日本援助絕無野心</p>
<p>帝圈政府慕終灣萬邦各得其所。使兆民悉安其位之大　緻，前已表朋謝印度之獨立，衷心具有同悄，並不惜予以視珊。今帝國政府確信織由印威臨　欽府之威立，偽完成印度之獨立，具有至血重行抒認對狀政府之一成目的，予以一切援助一對印度加重其壓破，或施以懷柔政策。然英國之飾諸印度者。畢竟僅有桎梏。吾人之奮起即為排除英美之桎檐，今印度人之脈起亦同，日本必與印度北同奮國到慶，如印度臨時政府發言人之說明　日水馴於獨立後之印度，毫無政治經濟等野心，吾人之一年在增進印度民眾制服一日，不日必定來臨。</p>

<p>飛機增產是怎樣一條困缺的道路，祗要一看朴飛機工廠的那視緊猥工作的情形，就可以明白。高性能的工作機械，二十四小時嬰不停的轉動鈐，沒有娶，沒有夜，也沒有星期，什麼鄱沒有，埋頭努力，運轉全部設備·從事努力增選，為了想製造他培三倍的飛機　然廳那不是一蹴司幾的，使這可能的具體方法在那裏呢？</p>
<p>第一是發定的一元化、及規定格式的標準化，其必要性已數經討論，問題是在於用何種方式實行。「謀軍宮發定的統一」數原則的諒解，誠值得　賀，但在實施這發定的統一上，上撇軍儒省。下至發定委員會的妝置，意見分紋，莫衷一是。設銓軍需省，一手包辦軍需生產，在理論上是最所希望的方式之一。但這僅是形式上的整備。從將來的實效上看來。或許不能說是最好的方案。在這殺意義田。和統帥係持密切的關係而　置發定委員會仰似平是最現實的方案。</p>
<p>企業系統調整</p>
<p>第二是以飛機工業為中心的企業系統的調整嬰題。飛機工業可以說是一種組緲的工業，大韌飛機的另件在十萬個以上，小攤機須三萬至織萬的另件，飛機上面不能不潑置火　侮光平機械，電氣機械等各種部分品，飛機工業如欽增強生產至頂點，必頭調整有關企業的系統，否則生產的大抓充是不可能的。這企業系統的調整，在論次的閣瞧上蓄加以決定，航空用工作機械的企業集團，會表現了極好的模範。那就是說，在各地分別指定優秀的完成品工戲，負起一切責任，以前的協力工廠和這指定工廠巒切地聯鈴起來，徒結成集團。所以即使以前是製造宅成品的工　，有時亦排成為部分品工廠。這運營先頭由泰工省參劻軍部的需要，一元的統一發定，師統制會依比例向各指定公司定貨。所需要資材約硼給，統制會依商工省的指示而行。是以勢響內分工廠的製品，約雜總工廠約餚導而製造，女給綿工廠，不能苒像以前那樣在價格便宜的工廠便發書其製品，　成品的繳納，由滿工省依物評動員計劃的比例而使繳絲於各發定老。這是和德國的「連鎮剔　相類鉛的企業整羅，以贊本熱網瞥關係作某礎之以認的製造所的組合及生獸指導，遂告解體、企業的娜理抑譽間應唱仍在以前的指揮隸屬關係上，從純生慶技術的覓地出發、實施以新的製品的種類為基礎的製造所之親合。這可說是採用越過資本的生　指導制。</p>
<p>海陸運輸一貫</p>
<p>第三，要增　二倍三倍的飛機，一切素材如電力·煤·銅鐵及工作機械，運輸的船　等同樣也須增加二三倍，勞務資金在這裏不用說。在這種意義上，「日滿食糧絕對向給的狎勢之確立」•「又海陸運輸之一貫的強化」，有朮大的意義。海陸巡絡的一貫性，乃當然　予強濃的，交通省的　置·正是一般織鉛所期　的。我派時俟，希望有抜木塞滅的措置。</p>

<p>價格的簡單化</p>
<p>最後。說到價格之崙底前單化的問題，低物價欽策不能不堅持到底。這價格的徹底簡單化燃和增強生產強力起併起來考察，所以變更以前的規定格式，計算成本，徒然　費時間而　海生產，關於工作機械，採用戰時型。同時，　　制會，及政府機關打成一片，從鐘決定審定　格、巡些是應研究的　點　企業集團如依其自　　行，在其內部關係上，價格及其他諸統治法規亦應停止適用。要之，在於政府之強　的實踐力，尤其　運行國政之根抵的內閣之政治力，期待更深。（全文完）翔：譯向九月廿九日羅部期日新聞）</p>

<p>對於米糧統制委員會，我們願在這萬補充一點意見：我們認爲辦理糧政，是一個艱鉅的工作；牠其艱巨，故司其事者，斷不能視爲刋藪所在，更不能作爲人情斷應的機構·蓋祇有義務，而無權利，祗任勞苦，而無利益，方才可以失訂忠良，毋忝厥戰。</p>
<p>米統會在用人行政方面，必須堅守以下兩個原則：（一）凡主持各地辦事處及各地同業之主任委員，均應遴選負有物望信　之糧食界領袖担任，決不可位置私人，尤不宜位置業外人，使任各地重要工作，致失設立米統會之本旨。此次各地選舉米糧公會主任委員，希望各舉本業中聲望　孚之領袖出而主持，毋使一二業外人插足其間，徒以攪亂糧政，重蹈已往的覆轍，（二）關於收買米糧，日前該會全持當局及友邦負責官史，曾一致主張持平公正，勿以低價壓抑農民；尤望交通機關及軍警當局，處處盡力協助，俾予糧商以應有之便利；如果部下有留難要挾情事，更常從嚴懲處毫不寬容，以肅糧政的風紀。</p>
<p>總之，我們應知此次重組米統會的宗旨，在於矯正已往的弊病；從前一切稅政，從此予以更新，故使命與任務之重大，實超乎一切其他機構之上：萬一意存私利，發現不道德，不合軌範的情事，旣爲舉國所詬病，更爲鄰邦所譏笑，則則其罪惡庸能饒恕？因爲我們願望之深，故不覺顧慮之切；切望服務米統會者，職位不分大小，深自檢點約束，毋稍苟且，藉以協助國家糧政的成功！</p>

<p>愛文義路卡德路東首·黃家沙花園路三十三號，特立着一座三層樓的小洋房，向南還有一個竹籬笆　成的校圓，雖然交通異當便利，但是並不昆連市塵，眞是鬧中取靜的好所在！這就是著名的培養聾啞人材的學府——上海幅啞學校。</p>
<p>慘淡經營</p>
<p>竹籬笆外，傳出「呀呀」學語的聲浪，一進大門，敎育聾啞子女的情彩，一幕幕呈現在目前。校長汪鏡淵，一位熱心盲啞敎育事業　三十多年的半聾的學者。感慨地陳述中國聾啞教育事業的情況：</p>
<p>中國第一個敎育聾啞兒童的學校，是民國紀元前二十七年在山東烟合創辦的啓瘖學校，至今還在繼續進行，民國五年，又出現了南通盲啞學校，民國八年出現了北平聾啞學校等等，但是今日大部分已經停頓了。在上海，早在民國紀元前二十年，就有徐家匯聖母院創辦的　啞學校，至今還在艱苦支持中。接着在民國九年出現第二個聾啞敎育機關—上海羣學會聾啞學校，但目前已告停頓，至今規模較大的，似乎要算民國十五年由美國名儒傳蘭雅　士所創辦的上海尊蘭雅壟啞學校就是今日的上海福啞學校了。</p>
<p>傳蘭雅博士是熱心於中國社會教育事業的前輩，他　資創辦了盲童學校之後，以年邁囘國，但仍關心於在中國的善業，認爲盲童敎養事業發動之後，對於聾啞人的敎育，亦不容或緩，所以於民國十五年函囑上海盲童學校校長傳步蘭氏籌辦聾啞學校　當時卽由傅氏及盲童學校敎員托鏡淵等籌備以三千元開辦費，在極司非而路康家橋創辦起「傳蘭雅聾啞學校」。當時杭州惠愛聾啞學校無力維持，有十餘名學生併入該校，放第一期學生即有二十餘名，第二期即已增至六卞名。原有校舍不敷應用·另外加租洋房，事業潮趨擴大。至民國十七年·傳博士關懷該校，爲圖永久，自美專函囑購江灣方而二十餘畝地基，永爲聾啞學校基金。但當時恰因北伐之役，上海一度陷於混亂局面，此事未及進行。是年冬季，傳蘭雅博士逝世，關於聾啞學校部分，未立遺囑，至該校基金無着。不得不實行緊縮，於十八年春改名上海福啞學校，另組校董會，實際上　童學校方面，每年仍酌量補助，年約二·三千元之間。且於員國廿三年全部選入盲童學校，繼續了三年之久。</p>
<p>民國二十六年，因爲校務發展，與盲童合校敎養，各方面都有不便，於是由校長傳步蘭及社會各界熱心人士如王一亭·陳鶴琴·施博羣。海上諸氏發起莫集基金五萬五千元運動。是年中日事變發生，不僅募捐運動完全停止，且因校址適常戰區·校務亦一時停頓。直到二十七年春，上海社會漸復安定，一般聾啞學生家長紛　恢復開學，乃由當時副校長汪鏡淵氏奔走籌劃，聘組校董會，先借戈　路國華中學（胡叔異氏主持）一部份校舍開學。至二十八年春，遷至白利南路前中央研究院內·恰在兆一豐公園對面，環境幽靜，而校舍尤爲軒昂，不　爲一最適於敎養之地。當時學生亦增至八十餘名，校務又呈蓬勃氣象，至三十年十二月八日以後，校址爲市政府所收用。直到三十一年的兒童節日。又遷到慈幼協會難嬰院的原址·正式恢復開學。</p>
<p>能聽啞能言</p>
<p>福啞學校校長汪鏡淵先生熱誠地談說聾啞教育。</p>
<p>襲啞敎育的最高目標，是要使聾者能聽、啞者能言。使不幸的聾啞人能和健全者同樣的讀書辦事。上海福啞學校也明白揭示其宗旨爲：一培育聾啞健公體格，陶冶聾啞良好品德，造　聾啞優秀人材、發　聾啞處世技能」，該校在敎授方面，採取美國式的個別敎育法，每級學生至多不超通十人，以便教學雙方精神貫注，又因爲一般聾啞學生的自修能力比較薄弱，所以每天校課八節，每節四十五分鐘，同時還得月種種方法　以啓發其向學的興趣與恒心。</p>
<p>襲啞敎育中敎基本的教法是「發音學」，使壟啞兒童發音，完全不再借助於手　或其他表記符號。國際間敎育啞童發音最流行的有柏爾氏的字母表，依各人發音器官之構造而編成基本字母。英法各種語言也都有各別的基本音表。我國則依柏爾氏字母之意而成國語基本字母，數目與國語注音符號相同。最普通的發音敎法是師生面對巨鏡並坐　使各能看到發某一音時發音器官之微細狀態及動作，以便校正，恢復發音的教法，最好是從幼兒期開始。那麼，經過四，五年的苦功，啞子能說話，便不算奇　了。</p>
<p>成年或年齡較大的聾啞生，要使恢復發音說話的本能比較困難，主要是由於本人大多數缺乏耐心，不如使用手式的便利。因此便授以「手式學」。所用手式，也有國語手式英語手式等分別，大致綜合拼音，象形，會意諸法而成。此外對於高年級學生，更可兼授「筆談法」。</p>
<p>聾啞人的說話問題已可以用發音法，手式法和筆談法等加以敎養訓練，日久不雛解決。至於聾老復聰問題，除半斐者可以利用增音器等以補助天然聽音　　之外，對於所謂天聲，目前尚無　別法術。各國聾啞學校所敎授的，除了依靠手式，筆談等了解他人意見之外，主要的是所謂「視話學」，就是使聲啞學生以目代耳，用視覺觀察說話者發音器官之動作及其神情而察知其語言內容。所以視話學之敎學，亦須不異艱苦，極度忍耐，經過長時期的訓練，纔能和平常人一樣了解對方或第二者的談話內容。</p>
<p>福啞學校對於聾啞學生的漱育，就其資力所及，依世界最新科學方法，並就本國學生之特殊情形，酌　變通活用，以求實際效果。十七年以來的努力，總算　中國聾啞敎育事業立下一些基礎，在全國聾啞學校中也要首屈一指的了。</p>

<p>大東亞戰爭，業巴進入對峙的階段，假如這個階段將來繼續得相當長久，那末打破道個均勢的將是什麼？我堅決的相信，假如日本能够把所有亞洲各民族的解放要求作為進行大東亞戰爭的動力，那末日本就能够很迅速地決定這個戰局。亞洲各民族的獨立運動，是淵源於世界史的必然性，而有不可抗的威力。承認明治維新的運動為淵源於世界史的必然性之日本民族獨立運動的這樣日本人，必須要承認，比日本稍徵文化落後的間一亞洲的各民族，模倣日本先例，發起民族解放運動，這是一件不可避免的事。芷如法國大革命後，任何人都不能阻撓全歐洲的民族主義運動是一樣，自然，亞洲的民族這動也沒有任何人能够阻攪和絞殺的。壓史早已在日本和中國證明了，現在正將在印度，菲律賓，緬甸等國證明。假如日本能够把握住進種歷史的必然性，而作為大東亞戰爭的推進力，則全亞洲的民族，將成為日本的戰友，儘管英美如何炫耀自已的龐大生產力，但對付佔世界人口一半的團結力，是莫之如何的。解放了的所有亞洲各民族，其力量成為日本台柱的時候，那次啊是決定大東亞戰爭大局的時候。</p>
<p>正如我在論文中一再聲述過的一樣，所謂全部亞洲民族，重要者只不過是日本，中國，印度。然而印度民族對日本的態度，是決定於日本對中華民族的態度上。現在甘地和尼赫魯等印度領袖，尙未公開整明支持日本的理由之一，就是中日事變尙未解決，在全盤上說，中國人對日本的態度，尙未明朗。假如中日事變，圓滿解決，假如中華民族全面支持日本，則印度民族也就毫不躇躊地全面支持日本了。由是觀之，大東亞戰爭的前途歸終還是決定於中日關係的如何調整上。</p>
<p>於是中日全面和平問題，又塵生了新的歷史意羲。這一全面和平，並非是藉外部的壓力可以達到的。藉外部的壓力所取得的和平，只不過是把表面的反抗壓至內裏而已。這種貌合神離的和平，反在內部聚集和增加警反抗力，假如一且外部壓力削弱時，則立刻由內部爆發成為燎原的巨大反抗火燄。為大東亞戰爭決定力的中日和平，決不可以是這樣的全面和平。然而對於不假借外部壓力，以雙方開誡佈公達到和平這一點，當然，擁有比重慶更大外部壓力的日本方面，是把持着更多的主動性的。中國全面和平決定亞洲各民族的動向，亞洲各民族的動向決定大東亞戰爭，大東亞戰爭的結果決定世界戰爭前途，假如眞的如此，那末世界戰爭的決定權仍操之於中日兩國的手裏，再具體一點說，就是在於日本對全面和平的主動性如何，以及中國對此的反應性如何上，這決非過甚之詞。</p>
<p>假如中國的悲觀論者在調整中日國交的可能性上，尋求悲觀論據的話，那另當別論，並非本文的範國，至於在歐洲形勢中，發見悲觀論據的態度，在此必須再一度地指出，這是本人不知不覺，在中國思想界上，接受了傳統上「抗戰觀念論」的影響。（漢譯）</p>

<h3 id="c59">西藥的限價統制和配給 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 朱文傑</p>
<p>西藥之限價，統制和配給，是件很難的事，因為它種類複雜而不能一一兼顧，而且體積小，價値高，很　於貯藏；尤其原料都係外國輸入，戰事爆發後，來源斷絕，所存之原料及成藥雖尙不少，但均操諸商人之手。因此備有大量貨品之商人常能操縱價格，儘景抬高。而另外商品之所有者亦只須貨品多藏一日，就有多一日之利益，就藏匿不賣；需求者不惜高價收購，於是貨價便扶搖直上。茲以見聞所得，分述於后，幷貢獻一些意見；以備當局參考：</p>
<p>限價與黑市</p>
<p>自上次當局嚴令限價一部份藥品後，因未能澈底辦理，遂徒使此種貨品　匿或流於黑市；因貨品之所有人以不足成本，或　於黑市市塲可多獲利故。而正當之需求者反而無法購得。遂無法購者，奔走終日不能得，成了有價無貨之怪現象。黑市形成關係由於各方：</p>
<p>一部份不正當貿易的西藥行－此種藥行之設文幾直是藥品之黑布市塲。若輩旣不作門市營業，又不作　發交易。專為買　黑市貨品及給回戶作拋進踢出之交易。所以藥房把已受限價而不能賣高之　品，或藥房及醫師由外國行家之配給品中國藥廠之規定賣價之藥品，但有他們收進轉賣給外埠之販　商或以黑市賣給需要之病家。在西藥漲風鼎盛時期，此種藥行之般立，竟如雨後春筍，因為設備簡單－一個電話，一個房問，一個熟悉之內行人，幷在報紙之出售欄營業欄內登出藥品之徵求或出售二項，如商店之門面，一日之貿易，進出數十萬不以為事－如此本輕利重之不法牟利，於取締黑市聲中，應先淸査嚴懲。</p>
<p>藥房－至藥房中購已限價之藥品，十九不能購得，當然不會因藥品一限價而立即售罄，因藥品不如肥皂煤米等日用品，限於生病者才需要，　末去路常然是　入黑市或囤積，如果當局組織査緝隊，嚴査各藥房之進貨銷貨之細賬，一經査出需嚴重取罰傳能得殺一　百之功，幷且請求市民告發屬，實者。給以若干之當金。</p>
<p>醫師－少數之醫師，亦貪求小利，由各行家或藥廠每月配得之配給品，亦從黑市售出牟利，於配給之行家本意相達，試患難道行家不會自己售於黑市嗎？配給者乃行家欲由醫師直接延惠於病人也。幷有介紹病人如購不到可至某處（他指定者）夫購，而暗中即把自己之藥委託某處代售，從中以一部份之佣金與之，此種醫師為道德名譽及信用計，殊不能發此種不義之財，</p>
<p>藥廠－藥廠之製品之價格，現須由當局核准，方可使用；在原料之黑市價已漲出製品成本以上者，藥廠每停止製造或發貨；而在市上已在流通之同種製品，亦將受　而流入黑市，藥廠是藥品之游流－我們必須一方面配給以原料，一方而澈査此廠已存之原料及製品，使甚繼續製造及發行。</p>
<p>統制</p>
<p>統制一地乏全部藥品，依照登記，收買及配給。使此地方之物品皆受其用，我們知道正當消費者之消費物品之多寡與價格之高下無關也。分述收買及配給：</p>
<p>教買原料－凡大件之原料如凡士琳小蘇打，：等，不管前次之已未登記或封。重令再重新登配，抗命者查出充公外，再處以數倍之罰金，由當局集資會同大規模之藥商組織一收買機關，不論名義（俱有者）均予收購，因為在上次登記時，不少雨戶委託藥商假借名義而登記者，而更有許多大藥房中堆積極　之存貨不售者，而西藥原料行之原料亦應收買在內。</p>
<p>通査成藥－已製之成藥，亦應登記，以為斷給時存貨之過多或缺乏之避免，應以此店之營業量而存以多少與各藥房之平均量計算，餘則以後配給時扣除或直接收買，缺則補充之。</p>
<p>配給－以原料配於藥廠，先澈査該廠之每月製品，原料消費之數量，相互對照，而公尤配給以原料。必要時需用此種藥品過多者，配給原料而强令製造，幷且嚴禁藏匿或轉售配給原料或製品。然後以各藥廠之製品，邇盤計算完善，以公允之辦法，參考其每月實售量而配給之。每藥房之零售價亦嚴限以相當利潤。</p>
<p>以上　述，都係無法中求有法，藥品之來源能通暢，當然是最好之辦法，否則如能詳細籌劃後，用迅速和嚴格去厲行統制，收獲定能很多，然而不澈底之實行，徒然弊多益少，如因限價而造成有價無貨之現象，亦是一例。最後井籲請各醫師儘量使角流通藥品代用斷擋貨。</p>

<p>— 陳伯民</p>
<p>在此非常時期物咨應當節約，只是任何人所贊同的，故而有識之士，有節約運動的推動，鄙人在醫生的一方而，聯想到國藥的一方面，有許多節約推動的需要，管見如左：</p>
<p>國藥行家之欲求藥材色品美歡，以希善價得沽，而常用硫磺來薰焙藥品，如此黃黑韓白，售價可以倍增，至於商人之惟利是趨，固不計論，然藥材因硫磺薰過以致改變性質，道德難以允許，而且硫磺又屬軍用品，來價奇昂，羊毛掛在羊身上，鄙意以為藥材只求出產道地，務希品質合用，何必多此一舉。</p>
<p>國藥號常求飲片之美觀，常有將藥品上打一層臘光者，如香附片，　夕利等，旣廢手續，無補於事，徒增病家之負擔而巳。</p>
<p>更有一點，應加改革者，如藥片之切得絕薄如膜，工夫太廢，售價常然照算，如法半夏，生白芍，製南星，川烏，草烏，等，國藥號有「附片飛上天，檳　要切一百二十八片」之俗諺，在此風尙節約，飲片常求配合認眞，何必求之形式上之漂亮，大有改切較原之片的需要。近時外界常有患病不勝醫藥上負擔之傳言，鄙人忝屬醫界，醫藥本乃手背相速，為擁護非常時　之節約運動以及顧及病家之負擔問題起見，謹將鄙見貢獻　業同人，惟因骨哽在喉，一吐為快，知我罪我，其在斯歟。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Answer to Pessimists <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toho</p>
<p>Since Badoglio's surrender and the German retreat on the Eastern Front, it must be admitted that pessimism has been growing among some Chinese people. They are beginning to wonder if Germany will soon follow Italy's fate! If that happens, then Japan and the Nanjing government, situated in the Greater East Asia region, will face unprecedented difficulties! Whether this observation is correct is of great importance to the fate of Japan and China, so it is necessary to answer it thoroughly. As explained in the past, Badoglio's surrender resulted in the removal of opportunists from the Axis camp, and the situation became favorable to the Axis. Or, to say that Germany's strategic position "is absolutely invincible," I think this kind of explanation cannot fully convince pessimists. Whenever I encountered these pessimists in the past, I always asked this question in return: Let's assume your observation is correct, but after Germany and Italy fail, it must be admitted that there is no longer a strong wall against the invasion of Europe by Soviet forces. At the same time, it must also be admitted that the pressure to suppress liberalism and communism in various European countries has suddenly disappeared. If so, it goes without saying how liberalism and communism, lurking in Germany and Italy, will flourish, and even liberalism and communism, lurking in countries such as France and Spain, will advance by leaps and bounds like bamboo shoots after rain, thus creating a situation suitable for Soviet invasion of Europe. If there is no hindrance to the westward development of Soviet forces, then it is not difficult to imagine that a wave of communist revolution will be set off in Europe at the same time as the defeat of Germany and Italy. Therefore, if Britain and the United States defeat Germany and Italy, then the European problem will not be solved. Furthermore, after the collapse of Germany and Italy, the flames of European communism will probably cause the rise of liberalism and communism within Britain and the United States, thus threatening the position of the ruling class in Britain and the United States, who are currently engaged in war. Then, even if Britain and the United States defeat Germany and Italy, they will not only be unable to get out of the European quagmire, but will sink deeper and deeper. Even if Britain and the United States "solve" the European problem, in that situation, it would be better to say that the European problem "solved" Britain and the United States. In this case, it is even more absurd to say "attack Japan with all our strength after solving the European problem." Therefore, the Greater East Asia War will not be decisively affected by the "solution" of the European problem.</p>
<p>Hypersensitive pessimists may raise a counter-question to my statement: "If Britain and the United States can compromise with the Soviet Union on the European issue after the defeat of Germany and Italy, then won't Britain and the United States be able to attack Japan with all their strength?" This is indeed correct. It can also be said that it is not absolutely impossible for Britain and the United States to compromise with the Soviet Union on the European issue alone. But a real compromise between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union is impossible even now, let alone in that situation, wouldn't it be even more difficult? The following three points are appropriate answers to the pessimists' counter-questions.</p>
<p>Even if the Soviet Union itself can promise not to invade Europe, it does not have the will to prohibit the spread of communist ideology in Europe.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union does not have the will to help Britain and the United States suppress the communist wave that occurs naturally within European countries.</p>
<p>After the defeat of Germany and Italy, the Soviet Union is not so carefree that it does not know who its greatest enemy in the world is.</p>
<p>Of course, there are still skeptics who are not satisfied with these three explanations and advocate the argument that Britain and the United States will attack Japan with all their strength. Okay, let's take a step back and admit this assumption: After Britain and the United States "solve" the European problem, Britain and the United States will attack Asia with all their strength. Even in this situation, I still dare to assert that the Greater East Asia War will not be decisively affected. How is my judgment possible? Indeed, we cannot deny the enormous productivity of the United States, especially we cannot deny the enormous aircraft productivity of the United States, which will eventually exert its power on the Pacific battlefield. If Britain and the United States use all their aircraft in a major offensive in East Asia, its power will indeed be terrifying. It has already been proven on the European battlefield that the issue seems to be air combat in the future. In the past, people generally said that aircraft could not have a decisive force on the war. However, looking at the shape of modern air combat in which a large formation of one thousand aircraft air raids every day and can drop more than one thousand tons of bombs, it seems that the idea that aircraft cannot determine the war has reached a point where it cannot be established. Indeed, it cannot be denied that in Europe, aircraft can achieve a certain degree of decisiveness. In this case, can we say the same in the Greater East Asia War? Needless to say, there will be a Pacific Ocean between Japan and the United States. Even with the recent development of the aircraft industry, it is still quite difficult to overcome this distance strategically. At the same time, even if the United States wants to air raid Japan, it is not an easy task to find a suitable land base near Japan from which to take off large-scale aircraft formations. Taking off aircraft from aircraft carriers has its limits in terms of quantity and bomb load, so I don't think it is possible to carry out a large-scale offensive against the Japanese mainland like the battlefield in Europe. Of course, it is possible to use the Chinese mainland as a base, but it must be known that if a large group of aircraft is organized from Chongqing to air raid Japan, I am afraid that one-third of the strength will be sacrificed on the way. If aircraft do not have the decisive power to attack Japan, then the navy and army will not have the decisive power to attack Japan. Therefore, even if Britain and the United States attack Japan with all their energy, the military force that can quickly determine the Greater East Asia War cannot be concentrated. Of course, the distance from Japan to the United States is the same as the distance from the United States to Japan, so there is no special reason for Japan to quickly resolve Britain and the United States. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese people had already considered it to be a great and long-term war unprecedented in history. Today, after two years of arduous fighting, it is increasingly proving to be an indestructible truth. In short, no matter how the European war situation develops recently, there is no sufficient reason to assert that it will have a decisive impact on the Asian war situation. The pessimists' analysis of the current world situation is completely a fabrication behind closed doors, and it is obviously influenced by the so-called "anti-Japanese clichés."</p>

<h3 id="e2">Japan Officially Announces Recognition of the Provisional Government of India; Declares Willingness to Provide Assistance to Achieve Goals <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 11:00 AM on the 23rd that Subhas Chandra Bose established the Provisional Government of India on the 22nd of this month. The Imperial Government notified its recognition of the said provisional government on the 22nd. The Imperial Government declared that the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India under the leadership of Subhas Chandra Bose is believed by the Imperial Government to be a major step forward for the people of India in realizing their long-cherished desire for Indian independence, and therefore grants recognition and declares its willingness to provide all cooperation and support to the said government in its efforts to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>Shaonan, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Provisional Government of Free India announced on the 23rd that the first meeting of the Provisional Government of Free India was held at Chairman Subhas Chandra Bose's residence starting at 9:00 PM on the 22nd, chaired by Chairman Bose. At the meeting, a resolution was passed to thank the comrades in India who are leading the anti-British struggle and the patriots who have contributed their lives to restoring India's freedom. The comrades also exchanged views on India's domestic economy.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Significance of Japan's Move is Great <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government's recognition of the Provisional Government of Free India is different from the ordinary recognition of an independent country in international law. The Provisional Government is not the government of an independent country, but one established with the goal of striving for future independence. Therefore, it can be said that the government recognizes this provisional government, but it does not establish formal diplomatic relations under international law like those between independent countries. Therefore, diplomatic envoys will not be exchanged, and necessary negotiations between the two sides will be conducted by their respective overseas agencies. The most noteworthy point about Japan's recognition of the Provisional Government is that the Japanese government's recognition of the Provisional Government will coincide with the declaration issued by the government authorities. The Provisional Government of Free India is a government fighting to challenge the enemy and for the permanent salvation of India, a friendly country. This Provisional Government echoes the movement within India to promote independence and has the mission of driving out the evil forces of Britain from India and establishing a formal government in the future. This time, Japan took the lead in granting recognition, which is actually a congratulatory message for the Indian liberation war.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Statement by President Amau <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Information Bureau President Amau released the following statement regarding the Japanese government's recognition of the Provisional Government of Free India:</p>
<p>The Provisional Government of Free India was born on October 22nd. The independence of India is the long-cherished wish of all Indian people and the expectation of all countries in the world. Burma, which has been groaning under British oppression and exploitation for a long time, has already become independent. The Philippines, which has been oppressed by imperialism and whose national characteristics have not been developed, has also been resolutely born as one of the countries in East Asia. Now, with the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, it adds to its glory.</p>
<p>British Exploitation and Oppression of India</p>
<p>Britain extended its aggressive claws to India in the early 17th century, sucking the blood of the Indian people and taking their wealth. However, the Indian people gradually developed a spirit of resistance, and their desire for independence has become even stronger since the Russo-Japanese War. During the First World War, the British government used the promise of granting India autonomy as bait in order to exploit India's human and material resources as much as possible, but after the war, the British government not only failed to fulfill its promise, but instead imposed greater oppression. Thousands of people have been killed. Since the start of this war, Britain's exploitation of India has become even more severe, requisitioning Indian people and making them stand at the forefront. According to the figures released by the British government in June of this year, the British Empire has lost 500,000 soldiers since the start of the war, of which Indian soldiers accounted for two-tenths, or more than 100,000 people. In addition, the excessive burden of military spending and the supply of military materials to the population have caused India to suffer from malignant inflation and a serious shortage of materials.</p>
<p>Implementing Tyranny and Creating Famine</p>
<p>Moreover, the so-called man-made famine has been caused in Bengal due to British tyranny, and the number of people dying of starvation is increasing day by day. This kind of tragic news can also be seen in reports from Britain and the United States, and it has become an important issue in the British Parliament. Britain's oppression of India has been strengthened recently, and its momentum has become more pronounced since August of last year, becoming the so-called Atlantic Charter of the British and American war aims. Although the principle of national self-determination is clearly stated in it, it does not apply to India. The deceitful policy of Britain and the United States can be said to be completely exposed here. Under these circumstances, there is absolutely no hope for India's freedom to be obtained from Britain. There is no other way but to use force to drive British forces out of India. This has been resented by patriots all over the world.</p>
<p>Striving for Independence and Working Hard</p>
<p>Subhas Chandra Bose has always been a patriot who has been working hard for India's independence. After being arrested by British officials in India a few years ago, the Indian people immediately went on strike to show their resistance. Later, he went to various countries to bury himself in the difficulties of saving the country. He came to Japan in June of this year and went to the South. Since then, he has strengthened the Indian Independence League and the Indian National Army, and has steadily advanced the independence movement. Now, the opportunity is ripe, and the Provisional Government of Free India has finally been established. This government is not only a political power to strive for independence, but also has the mission of turning India from a temporary liberation to a formal Indian government. The Indian National Army is composed of young Indian people who are filled with enthusiasm for independence and are willing to sacrifice themselves for the country. When these soldiers begin to rush to the ancestral network to persuade liberation and attack, they will also be able to completely rid India of centuries of shackles and be liberated.</p>
<p>Japan's Assistance Has No Ambition</p>
<p>The Imperial Government admires the great ideal of allowing all countries to obtain their place and making all people live in peace. It has previously expressed its support for the independence of India, and sincerely has the same feelings, and will not hesitate to provide assistance. Now, the Imperial Government firmly believes that the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India has the most important responsibility for completing India's independence. We recognize and support the purpose of the government and provide all assistance to India to increase its oppression or implement a policy of appeasement. However, what Britain decorates India with is ultimately only shackles. Our struggle is to eliminate the shackles of Britain and the United States, and the rise of the Indian people is the same. Japan must work with India to celebrate the country's independence. As the spokesman of the Provisional Government of India explained, Japan has no political or economic ambitions for India after independence. The day will surely come when our people will increase their mastery over India.</p>

<p>Lisbeta, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing side is always making false announcements about the Japanese army's offensive on the Yunnan border, not allowing others to know the whole story. According to a telegram, the former spokesman of the Chongqing Military Commission said when foreign reporters visited him on the 22nd that the Japanese army has sealed off the Nujiang River crossing, and the Chongqing army in the Ligung Mountain area is in danger of being sealed off. It is said that the Japanese army is attacking the western highway of the two provinces in three routes. The soldiers on the border are already in a state of encirclement. The Japanese army that started its actions from Zhina is attacking northeast and east. The Japanese army with even more strength is advancing north from Wenan Longling face. It has now reached the west bank of the Nujiang River. It is said that the Japanese army has awakened the whirlpool and recognized the river. It is a mistake to transmit the cone. The Japanese unloaded and seized the crossing of the Nujiang River on the west bank. Most of you have to listen. Because the woven Japanese army has controlled the southwest of South Africa. Add the former Qian area of Burma Xunxiang Zhilanna, and the three-fish running area in the middle of its carriage and anger. In this war, the three weeks before the four were able to retreat.

<p>Argentina, Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Washington telegram, US Navy announced on the 21st: US Navy patrol bomber clashed with Japanese army bomber in the vicinity of Korei Sai Island in the Bering Sea on the afternoon of the 21st.</p>
<h3 id="e8">British Newspaper Admits Difficulty in Counter-Attacking Burma; Extreme Obstacles to Transportation <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a special telegram from the Swedish capital of the Tokyo-based Yomiuri Shimbun, the enemy army in the Shi Xun area began to stir after the rainy season. On the dawn of the 8th of this month, it attempted to land on the Mengduo side of the Burmese-Indian Fourth Army border, but it was annihilated by the Japanese army's guard. The pre-war blueprint of the counter-attack has been completely shattered. Regarding this matter, the Allied forces' East Asia Command argued on the 19th that although the British-Indian army's attack on Mengduo was the first attack on Burma after the rainy season, it was a very large-scale attack. Also, the British press warned the British that it would be dangerous to have too many expectations for the British-Indian counter-attack on Burma. For example, the London Times pointed out that in the Burmese operation last winter, the Indian Army Command at that time did not pay attention to the firmness of the Japanese defense positions and the inferiority of the Axis ships and air force. This was the reason for the tragedy in Arakan. Haxpawn pointed out the importance of the Burmese operation. The so-called counter-attack by Brigadier General润森盖 and the failure of Arakan were purely due to the small advantages of the terrain, but the Japanese army has long been trained in this kind of climate. After this failure, the British combat authorities knew that if they wanted to recapture Burma, they had to launch an extremely difficult large-scale operation. Burma's geographical conditions are very favorable for defense, and the attacking army must conduct several river crossing operations. It is difficult to develop hundreds of miles of large forest areas, especially because the rear supply is difficult. They can only transport cattle and sheep and cars from India, otherwise they have to wait for planes to transport them from the air. The longer this sleeve operation lasts, the more pain it will feel. Today, most British people have not correctly recognized that the transportation capacity of the Assam-Bengal railway and highway is limited, and it is difficult to transport large numbers of soldiers and military materials to the Sami Shidian front. Also, the Brahma Putra River can solve part of the problems, but the river changes again and again, and the water flow is turbulent, which only transmits the weaknesses of the military. However, any commander must know that when the Burmese two divisions deploy naval operations, the ships that they do not have will be bombed by the Japanese air force from three sides, and at the same time, they will be attacked by the army of one side. Its military power must rely on light aircraft carriers. Moreover, the harbor facilities in the various ports of India, which are the naval bases, are poor, so they are subject to significant limitations. Although it is shaped to quickly implement the combat plan, its greatest obstacles are strategic and transportation problems.</p>

<h3 id="e12">German Command Reveals Badoglio Regime's Conspiracy to Betray <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to Lu Haithong News: Documents released by the Supreme Command revealed Badoglio's conspiracy to try to hand Hitler over to Britain and the United States. The documents revealed that before the Badoglio government surrendered, the Italian military attaché stationed in Italy asked Schleicher to convey the Italian government's request, hoping that Schleicher would immediately go to Italy to discuss the issue of intensifying resistance against the common enemy. At that time, it had been decided to hand over Mussolini Hitler. It was obviously an attempt to hand Schleicher over to Britain and the United States as well.</p>
<p>Perceptive of His Treachery</p>
<p>However, the German government refused this invitation after receiving information that the Badoglio government was preparing for a mutiny. These documents remind readers of the situation after the Italian coup. The signs of the rebellion and the loyalty of the Badoglio regime to the Axis were mutually ornamental. It supplied the navy with fuel oil without disclosing the amount of Italian oil reserves and the border between Germany and Italy. The intention to mutiny needs to be increasingly clarified. The German army transported to the south to protect the Italian border, while the Italian roads around the Alpine region were attacked by the German army in three or five traffic lines. Three Italian divisions were stationed on the German-Italian border. On August 7, by order of Italian General Luo Yazhai, they resisted the German army in Wanshi Diqi. Only after the German army seized the three places designated to enter the Italian border, General Rozoer, General Yoterxi, and Military Attaché Ren Lun discussed with General Roate, the head of the Italian delegation in Boloni on the 5th of the month, the conspiracy to mutiny was obvious.</p>
<p>Playing Along</p>
<p>The German delegation protected the meeting with stormtroopers to prevent accusations. General Yueteta requested that the Italian army be woven in the north, while Luo Yaqin stationed the Italian army at the main entrances and exits of Tongyi and Tongwang Xi and Krot, and Luo sought to have the Italian army stationed at important seaports. At the same time, Luo Yazhai reiterated his loyalty, and Germany also sincerely accepted his sincerity to prevent Luo Yatai from discovering that the country had been suspected. The government of Austria and Wu repeatedly expressed its loyalty in the late August and early September, and at the same time, General Caste and General Eisenhower, the commander-in-chief of the Allied Forces in North Africa, held negotiations and signed a surrender agreement on September 3.</p>
<p>Military Measures</p>
<p>The document also stated the German countermeasures, the retreat of the Fourth West Li Island, to avoid the interception of the armed forces there. The army can firmly defend the bridge fort of Sicily. The German Command took many measures to occupy Naples, Walles, Rome, Spezia, and Genoa, and occupied all the main entrances and exits of the German-Italian border and the French-Italian border. On September 8, the US telegram covered the news that the Allied forces had surrendered to Italy. General Luo Yatai telephoned General Zaiselin to state that he did not know "the secret discussions and hurtful actions of the Royal Family and Badoglio," and submitted a list of "those suspected of having secret contact with the enemy," and submitted "political and military information" to the army, which was rejected by the General Army. At that time, the Italian army continued to concentrate seven divisions in the Luo Qun Ni area, including tank fleets and two divisions stationed in the north and south of Rome.</p>
<p>Italian Army Surrenders</p>
<p>However, the German army led Rome, and the Italian army in northern Italy surrendered due to Rommel's oppression. Genoa, Spetzja, Bolonna, Verona, and Kli were captured by the German army. More than 90,000 Italian soldiers were disarmed. The Italian ships and merchant ships in the Aegean Sea were all taken by the Sui army, and the Italian ships in Spezia joined the team. Badoglio originally wanted to hand over ten divisions of the Sui army to the British and Americans, but they were disarmed by the German army.</p>

<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to the National News Agency: British and American forces have intensified their joint offensive and reconnaissance activities in the Apennine Mountains and along the coastal areas of Italy. Although the battles are only local in nature, the deployment of a large number of tanks by the Allied forces is noteworthy. After setbacks in the German defense line in the Apennine Mountains, the enemy apparently does not expect the success of its infantry tactics. Therefore, the British and American forces, disregarding the difficult mountainous terrain, are again using tank groups to support infantry operations and avoid significant losses. At the same time, the Allied forces are using a large number of bullets to attack German positions in the mountains and hollows.</p>
<p>British Defeat on the Upper Volturno River</p>
<p>On the other hand, a detachment of British reconnaissance troops consisting of tanks and infantry suffered a serious defeat near the village of Rocchetta and the Upper Volturno River. In the fierce fighting, German 88mm cannons concentrated fire on four British tanks. Lacking protection, they attempted to dig trenches for self-defense but were disrupted by heavy German artillery fire. During this period, a British regiment launched an offensive on the highway leading to the German defense area east of the Volturno River. German artillery positions near Venafro were again attacked by large Canadian forces. According to reports, some time ago, several Canadian squads suffered heavy losses in the area, including nine Sherman tanks that were immobilized. In the eastern sector, the Eighth Army continues to reorganize its units, and some army squads are under fire from several German artillery positions.</p>

<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: The great battle on the 150-kilometer front between Kremenchug and Dnepropetrovsk on the Eastern Front has lasted for nine days. The momentum has not subsided and has now entered the second phase, where the Soviet army is striving to protect the flanks of the breakthrough point without seeking to advance its vanguard. The breakthrough in the German defense line presents the Soviet army with great difficulties and dangers because the German command is often able to make appropriate strategic adjustments to cope with difficult situations in surprising ways. The German army is now reorganizing its troops and reserves, and the Soviet army feels it is extremely difficult to maintain the positions it has occupied in recent days. The Soviet army continues to reinforce the gap it has created with new troops, but does not attempt to expand it. This is different from the initial battles. The Soviet army uses its main force to protect its flanks. Therefore, another new development is expected, but it is not known how many days this second phase, which has a cautious nature, will last. The German military believes that the fighting will become more intense again. The fighting is particularly fierce in the Melitopol area, about several tens of kilometers from the coast to that location, and the defense line between Melitopol and Zaporozhye is about 100 kilometers long. On Thursday, the Soviet army made a forward thrust to the north, but suffered heavy losses.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Soviet Army Heavily Reinforced, Attempting to Widen Gap <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Bern, 23rd (Reuters) - Reuters reports: The current focus of the fighting on the Eastern Front remains the Great Dnieper Bend. On Sunday, the Soviet army attempted to widen its breakthrough between Kremenchug and Dnepropetrovsk. Although the Soviet vanguard's new attempt to advance south is not yet apparent, this is inevitable. On Wednesday and Thursday, the enemy forces gathered a large number of fresh troops into the gap. Some of these fresh troops were engaged in consolidating the edges of the gap, while the main force was preparing for a major offensive. The fighting on Thursday, although not as intense as at the beginning of the week, was still quite tense, especially the German defense positions south of Kremenchug and southwest of Dnepropetrovsk were under heavy pressure from the Soviet army. The fighting is still in progress in some places. There has also been fierce fighting between Zaporozhye and the Sea of Azov. The fighting in that area is closely related to the fighting in the northern Dnieper Bend because the enemy's strategic goals are the same in both areas.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Soviet Landing on Eastern Crimean Coast Unsuccessful <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>On Thursday, fighting also took place at the entrance to the Nogai Steppe. The enemy forces attacked the German-held territory on a front of 100 kilometers. The fighting was particularly fierce on both sides of Melitopol. The enemy's attacks were repelled, but fighting continues in some gaps. A small enemy squad attempted to land on the eastern coast of Crimea but was immediately driven back by the German coastal defense forces. However, it is still unknown whether this action was a precursor to a major landing. A summary of the situation elsewhere on the Eastern Front is as follows: The situation in the Krivoy Rog area is relatively stable. The enemy's offensive south of the city suffered significant losses. The offensive north of Siversk has made some improvements to the positions. The Soviet army moving north at the confluence of the Sozh and Dnieper rivers, attempting to encircle the German forces in the Rechytsa and Gomel regions, was unsuccessful. The enemy's offensive on the narrow front east of Orsha on the Smolensk-Minsk highway was repelled, and the Soviet army suffered heavy losses. The enemy's attempts to limit the fighting on the Volkhov and Neva rivers to a local nature, but the enemy has concentrated a large army in recent days, and a major battle may be imminent.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Japan Strengthens Domestic Situation <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Unification of Regulations</p>
<p>Just by looking at the tense work at the Nakajima Aircraft Factory, one can understand how difficult the path of increasing aircraft production is. High-performance machine tools operate non-stop for 24 hours a day, without holidays, without nights, without Sundays, without anything. They bury themselves in hard work, running all the equipment to strive to increase production threefold. But that is not something that can be achieved overnight. Where are the concrete methods to make this possible?</p>
<p>First, the unification of regulations and standardization of formats. The necessity of this has been discussed many times. The issue is how to implement it. The consensus on the principle of "unifying military regulations" is welcome, but in the implementation of this unification, from the Ministry of the Army and Navy down to the regulation committee, opinions are divided and there is no consensus. Establishing a Ministry of Military Procurement, which would handle all military production, is theoretically one of the most desirable approaches. But this is merely a formal improvement. From the perspective of future effectiveness, it may not be the best solution. In this sense, establishing a regulation committee that is closely related to the command system seems to be the most realistic solution.</p>
<p>Adjustment of Enterprise System</p>
<p>Second is the issue of adjusting the enterprise system centered on the aircraft industry. The aircraft industry can be said to be a kind of assembled industry. Large aircraft have more than 100,000 parts, and small aircraft require 30,000 to tens of thousands of parts. Aircraft must be equipped with various parts such as firearms, optical instruments, mechanical machinery, and electrical machinery. If the aircraft industry is to enhance production to its peak, it is essential to adjust the system of related enterprises. Otherwise, a large-scale increase in production is impossible. This adjustment of the enterprise system should be decided in the context of the industrial structure. The enterprise group of aviation machine tools has presented an excellent model. That is to say, outstanding finished product factories are designated in various places to take full responsibility, and the former cooperative factories are closely linked to these designated factories to form a group. So even factories that used to manufacture finished products sometimes become parts factories. In this operation, the Ministry of Munitions consults the needs of the military department, unifies the regulations in a centralized way, and the control association orders from each designated company in proportion. The necessary materials are allocated, and the control association acts according to the instructions of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Therefore, the products of factories within the system are manufactured under the guidance of the general factory. Supply factories can no longer simply issue their products to factories with lower prices as before. The delivery of finished products is carried out by the Ministry of Munitions according to the ratio of the mobilization plan. This is an enterprise reorganization similar to the German "linked system," with the Ziben thermal network relationship as the basis for the combination of accredited manufacturing plants and the provision of livestock guidance, resulting in decomposition. The industrialization and management of the company should remain within the previous command and affiliation relationship. Starting from the viewpoint of pure production technology, the combination of manufacturing plants based on the new type of product is implemented. This can be said to be the adoption of a production guidance system that transcends capital.</p>
<p>Consistent Sea and Land Transport</p>
<p>Third, to increase aircraft production two or three times, everything from raw materials such as electricity, coal, copper, iron, and machine tools, to transport ships must also be increased two or three times, not to mention labor and capital. In this sense, "establishing a system of absolute self-sufficiency in food between Japan and Manchuria" and "strengthening the consistency of sea and land transport" are of great significance. The consistency of sea and land coordination is naturally something to be strongly emphasized. The establishment of the Ministry of Transportation is what the public has been generally hoping for. I personally hope that there will be a decisive measure to clear obstacles.</p>
<p>Fourth, whether steel, money, coal, and so on, which are the foundations of all industries, can be obtained at the rate specified by the material mobilization plan is a problem. Perhaps this is one of the main reasons why the materials mobilization plan cannot be carried out satisfactorily. Also, the complexity of the various supply systems is very obvious. This should naturally be resolved. In addition, the thorough regulation of various control groups and public corporations should be implemented at this time.</p>
<p>Simplification of Prices</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to the issue of the complete simplification of prices, the low-price policy must be adhered to to the end. This complete simplification of prices must be considered in conjunction with the strengthening of production. Therefore, changing the previous regulations, calculating costs, only wastes time and hinders production. Regarding machine tools, wartime models should be adopted. At the same time, the control association and government agencies should work together as one to decide and review prices. These are points to be studied. If an enterprise group operates on its own, prices and other control regulations should cease to apply within its internal relations. In short, it depends on the government's strong practical ability, especially the political power of the cabinet, which is the foundation for the operation of national affairs. Deeper expectations are placed. (End of full text) (Source: Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, September 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Regulations for Applying for Permits for Rice Grain Procurement and Transportation Announced by the Rice Grain Control Committee <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Branch offices of the Rice Grain Control Committee will be organized and established in various regions within days and will immediately begin procurement and purchasing work. The procedures for applying for rice grain procurement permits and rice grain transportation passports have recently been established. Rice merchants who are designated as preparatory committee members of local rice grain trade associations must apply to the Rice Grain Control Committee or its subordinate offices for "Rice Grain Procurement Permits" when they intend to procure and transport rice grain within the same rice grain marketing management area. Rice merchants who are preparatory committee members of local rice grain trade associations must apply to the Rice Grain Control Committee for "Rice Grain Transportation Passports" when they intend to transport rice grain from one area within the rice grain marketing management area to an area outside that region.</p>
<p>Transportation Passports Issued by Region</p>
<p>The "Rice Grain Transportation Passports" applied for by the preparatory committee members of the rice grain trade association are limited to the following cases and are issued by the offices of their respective jurisdictions: (1) The Jintan Office issues permits limited to the transportation of rice grain from the Jintan Liyang area to Zhenjiang; (2) The Yixing Office issues permits limited to the transportation of rice grain from the Su Song Chang Jia area to the Suzhou First, Second, and Third Phase areas; (3) The Xiashi Office issues permits limited to the transportation of rice grain from the Hangzhou area to the Southeast Taihu Second Phase area.</p>
<p>Fill Out Application Forms in the Prescribed Format</p>
<p>Designated planned distribution agencies must apply to the Rice Grain Control Committee for "Rice Grain Transportation Passports" when they receive rice grain from the Rice Grain Coordination Committee and intend to transport it from one area within the rice grain marketing management area to an area outside that region. Holders of "Rice Grain Procurement Permits" and "Rice Grain Transportation Passports" must conduct procurement or transportation in accordance with the specifications of the Procurement Permit and Transportation Passport. Applicants for rice grain procurement permits or transportation passports must fill out the application form in the prescribed format, with one original and one copy.</p>
<p>Permits and Passports Must Be Returned After Use</p>
<p>When transporting rice grain in the Qingxiang area with a Rice Grain Transportation Passport, the procedures stipulated in the Provisional Regulations for the Zhejiang Anhui Rice Grain Marketing Management must be followed before implementation. Procurement permits or transportation passports are limited to one-time use and must be returned to the issuing office of the Rice Grain Control Committee immediately after use. If a rice grain procurement permit or rice grain transportation passport is lost, it must be reported to the original issuing Grain Control Committee or office, and an advertisement must be published at the applicant's expense by the original issuing agency to declare it invalid. When applying for a replacement for the aforementioned permits or passports, a guarantee from a reliable guarantor must be provided, but if it is deemed to be intentional fraud or gross negligence, replacement will not be permitted. Those who procure or transport with expired or invalidated permits or passports will be punished in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations for Rice Grain Marketing Management in the Three Provinces.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Subsidies for Teachers and Staff of Private Schools Will Be Issued Soon; First Batch of 800,000 Yuan <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>In light of the hardships faced by teachers and staff of private schools in this city, the municipal government, at the request of the Municipal Education Association, has agreed to provide a monthly subsidy of 500,000 yuan, which will be distributed by the Education Association to the teachers and staff of various schools. However, the source of this funding is from the municipal government's agreement with the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance to pay from the fees collected by the department assisting the municipal government. It was originally scheduled to begin in August, but according to the results of negotiations between the Municipal Finance Bureau and the Taxation Department, the Taxation Department can only raise 300,000 yuan in September and 500,000 yuan each month from October to December. Therefore, the first batch of subsidies consists of only 300,000 yuan for September and 500,000 yuan for October, totaling 800,000 yuan, which the Municipal Education Association has repeatedly requested from the municipal government. The municipal government has also repeatedly negotiated with the Taxation Department, but in reality, the Taxation Department can only provide this amount and can only be obtained from the Finance Bureau. Regarding how to allocate this amount, the Education Association has long convened representatives from the education associations of various districts to form a custody and allocation committee to discuss various allocation principles and withdrawal procedures, striving to make the procedures as simple and strict as possible. At the same time, after the Education Association receives the first batch of 800,000 yuan in government subsidies, it will begin to distribute them from the 27th of this month in accordance with the methods repeatedly decided by the custody and allocation committee.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Vegetables Are Shipped to Shanghai One After Another; Price Limits Are Announced Daily <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The market prices of various vegetables have previously been affected by the rising prices of all goods and the deliberate actions of illegal merchants, resulting in repeated price increases that have harmed the people's livelihood. The Central Market and relevant authorities, recognizing this, have actively taken measures to clear supply lines and investigate the truth. Those who engage in speculation will be severely threatened. According to a Shanghai News reporter, I learned from relevant sources yesterday that various green vegetables have recently reached the harvest period, so the quantity of vegetables shipped to Shanghai has obviously increased compared to before. The market is now full of spot goods, and market prices are falling. As a result, the general situation in the vegetable market is slightly better than it was a month ago. However, I understand that the Zhonggong Market is determined to stick to its original intention and, in addition to actively procuring various vegetables and shipping them to Shanghai one after another, will continue to assess and set standard price limits, which will be announced daily. All member brokers must strictly abide by these limits and must not deliberately exceed them. Otherwise, they will be punished in accordance with the regulations. As for various fresh meats such as pork, beef, mutton, fish, eggs, and other meat dishes, the authorities have already set price limits and listed them for public implementation. In order to ensure effective enforcement, the authorities have repeatedly sent personnel to various vegetable markets or sales firms to investigate.</p>

<p>According to news from the coal and charcoal industry yesterday, in order to balance the market situation and meet needs, the industry is actively clearing major supply lines and urging all members to procure in various production areas. However, due to the urgent need for improvement in transportation, the quantity shipped to Shanghai has been slightly affected. However, according to industry insiders, the amount of coal and charcoal stored in Shanghai is still substantial, sufficient for several months of demand. However, market prices have been pushed to their highest peak, which has greatly harmed the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Gauze Pricing and Allocation Measures Under Review by Authorities; Business Control Committee Answers Various Questions <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Business Control Committee's office for purchasing cotton yarn and cloth has been in operation for some time since the implementation of the regulations on the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. Various parties are quite concerned about issues such as pricing and allocation after the purchase of gauze and cloth. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically inquired with the Business Control Committee about this matter. The person in charge of the committee provided detailed answers. The following is an account of the conversation: (Question) From when should deposit slips be issued after the gauze and cloth have been inspected and purchased, and has the payment date been determined? (Answer) Regarding the initial payment date for this special fixed deposit slip, this association has already submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval. (Question) Various gauze and cloth merchants hope to shorten the payment period and pay the second installment of the bid price in advance, and request relief on various points. Is it possible to handle this? (Answer) This matter has been clearly stipulated by the authorities, and this association is handling it in accordance with orders. As for the request to mortgage or discount the deposit slips with the Central Reserve Bank, it is currently being reviewed by the Executive Yuan. (Question) What are the security responsibilities and surrogate custody measures after the purchase of gauze and cloth? (Answer) Before the completion of the acceptance procedures by this association, the security responsibility should be borne by the applicant for the sale. However, this association has now begun acceptance, and it should be completed soon. As for the surrogate custody measures, the office for purchasing gauze and cloth of this association has already been instructed to formulate them as soon as possible. (Question) What about the production allocation and transfer measures for the processing and manufacturing industries? (Answer) The allocation measures are being reviewed by the government and are expected to be announced soon. The transfer measures will also be adjusted accordingly upon implementation of the allocation. (Question) It is rumored that the purchase price of processed cotton cloth has already been reviewed and approved. When will it be announced? (Answer) The purchase prices of various cotton yarn and cloth were first proposed by the "Cotton Yarn," "Cotton Cloth," and "Processed Cotton Cloth" three-tier categories of the China-Japan Joint Price Investigation Committee and passed by the committee's second meeting. They have now been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and announcement.</p>

<p>The talk about the unification of the service age of self-defense corps members in the first and eighth districts of this city has attracted considerable attention from all circles. A reporter from the Central News Agency met yesterday with Qian Guoqiu, the secretary of the Baojia Section of the First Police Bureau, and asked about the truth of this matter. According to him, Gu Jiwu, the chief of the Baojia Section of the First Police Bureau, has been actively supervising his subordinates to promote work since taking office a few days ago, sparing no effort. Regarding the service age of the self-defense corps, he is also considering unified measures so that the advancement of Baojia administration can be consistent and without regret. The rumored news is slightly different from the planned unified measures, and the section is expected to make a formal decision and announcement within days.</p>

<p>Chen Chunpu, the Minister of Construction, in order to receive the directors, supervisors, and senior staff of various Sino-Japanese joint venture companies, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago, accompanied by the Vice Minister of the Ministry. Yesterday (the 23rd) at 4:00 PM, a tea party was held at the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel to receive key personnel from the following companies. Those in attendance included Kikuji Takashima, the president of the Central China Development Company; Shunichi Takasu, the director of the Central China Railway Company; Chengboye Tang, the chairman of the Central China Water and Electricity Company; Su Xiwen, the chairman of the China Shipping Company; and Takeo Yamamizu, the vice-chairman, totaling over one hundred representatives from twelve companies.

<p>The Municipal Aquatic Products Trade Association previously submitted a case to the Eighth District Office requesting exemption from the two percent tax on the grounds that the sale of various aquatic products to water merchants and fishmongers was not a resale in nature. The Eighth District Office rejected the case, believing that, as the buyers were all water merchants and mobile fishmongers, it was already admitted that the buyers were not formal members of the same trade, and therefore the two percent tax should be paid in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Coal Ball Raw Material Supply to Be Fully Maintained; Coal Ball Factories Urged to Increase Production <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The recent sudden shortage of coal ball supply in this city has caused considerable anxiety among normal consumers. Upon investigation, the reason lies in the fact that there are some people in the coal industry who are taking the opportunity to seek exorbitant profits. The authorities have long been paying attention to this point. Although applications have been made, the determination to maintain the price limit of 32.5 yuan per dan remains unchanged. Recently, measures such as limiting the quantity of retail sales at coal ball shops have been taken, and at the same time, personnel have been dispatched undercover as buyers to investigate whether coal ball retailers are violating the price limit. Therefore, the black market trend has been suppressed. Currently, the relevant authorities intend to maintain the continuous supply of coal ball raw materials so that the coal ball factories can operate continuously and increase production, so that the overall situation of this essential fuel can be stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Soap and Match Retailers Must Absolutely Abide by Agreements; Severe Penalties for Violations <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The First District Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality is very strict in its management of the 397 retail stores allocated soap and matches and requires them to sign an agreement. Each retail store must absolutely strictly abide by the agreement. The main points are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>Main Points of the Agreement</p>
<p>Retailers are only allowed to accept purchase certificates for allocation of matches or soap that bear the same registration number as the store. During the first period of selling matches or soap, retailers should only sell upon presentation of purchase certificates for matches or soap bearing the words "First Period." The same applies to subsequent periods. Any purchase certificate for matches or soap may only be used during the period indicated by the number on the certificate. For example, the "First Period" is only valid during the first period and is invalid after the expiration date. In addition, there are the following: At any time, matches and soap must be delivered and picked up according to the stipulated price. At any time, strictly comply with the regulations and sell all allocated matches or soap to users who hold match certificates or soap certificates with the corresponding registration number. Each store must absolutely strictly abide by and comply with the above items. Violations will be severely punished.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Rumors of Selling Unlicensed Milk Untrue <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the supply of fresh milk, the responsible party of the First District Office recently informed the reporter that "the recent report that a milk company licensed by this office sold a large amount of unlicensed milk is not true. The milk supply in the first district has always been closely supervised by the Health Section of this office. Not only are personnel dispatched to inspect the milk companies periodically, but also close attention is paid to everything every morning and evening to prevent the private transport of unlicensed milk. On the one hand, milk samples are taken from various milk companies for chemical testing. In order to put unlicensed milk to normal use and to consider the milk sheds in Pudong and neighboring areas that cannot meet the standards of Grade A or Grade B, this office has formulated measures for licensing Grade C milk sheds. One provision in these licensing regulations stipulates that this type of milk can only be used for feeding pigs or for industrial purposes. Although there have been cases of unlicensed milk being privately transported into this district in the past, the private transport has rarely been discovered since this milk can be sold to milk powder manufacturers. Based on the above, milk consumers need not worry about the milk delivered by licensed companies."</p>

<p>The Jiming Cup basketball tournament, which was organized to raise funds for the Jiming Hospital, opened at 7:00 PM last night at the Baxianqiao China Youth Gymnasium. Huang Yanfang personally attended the opening ceremony and threw the ball. In the first match, Chen You faced Huaying. With the help of Tao Shaosheng and Zhang Jinxuan, Chen You's strength was strengthened. Huaying's combat power was weakened due to Li Zhenzhong's absence. At the end of the first half, Chen You took the lead with a score of 22 to 13. After changing sides, Huaying counterattacked, and Chen You also continued to work hard. In conclusion, Chen You overcame Huaying with a score of 29 to 32. The main battle was Renyu against Western Youth. As the fierce battle began, Western Youth scored five points in one go. A few minutes later, Ma Canxi shouted and established Renyu's first achievement. The first half ended with Western Youth taking the lead with a score of six to two. After the break, Western Youth's Ye Yun, Kaiji Milov, and Funik each made contributions. Renyu tried hard to catch up, but Wang Zhiqing scored a lot of points, but it was difficult to turn the tide. In conclusion, Western Youth won with a score of 49 to 15. Zhu Dashanshi, a philanthropist, bought the charity ball for 40,000 yuan, which is admirable. Starting at 7:00 PM today, the original venue will continue to be held, and Renyu will fight Western Youth again. Before the match, there was a women's recording team against Sansheng. The former Shanghai first-class famous players Gu Shujun, Li Yunzhi, Huang Pengyuan, Wang Yinlan, Wang Weizhen, etc. have strong strength. Tickets are still sold for 20 yuan.

<h3 id="e48">Dedicated to the Rice Control Committee <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Rice and Grain Control Committee, we would like to add a few supplementary opinions: We believe that handling grain administration is an arduous task. Because it is arduous, those who manage it must not regard it as a place to make money, let alone as an organization for personal favors. Only by having obligations and no rights, only by enduring hardships and having no benefits, can one be loyal and not disgrace one's mission.</p>
<p>The Rice Control Committee must adhere to the following two principles in terms of personnel and administration: (1) The chief commissioners of local offices and various industry associations should be selected from leaders in the food industry who have a high reputation and credibility. Private individuals must never be placed in these positions, especially those who are not in the industry, so that they can take on important work in various places, which would lose the original purpose of establishing the Rice Control Committee. It is hoped that the election of chief commissioners of local rice and grain associations will be conducted by leaders in the industry who are highly reputable and trustworthy, and that no one or two people outside the industry will be allowed to intervene, so as not to disrupt grain administration and repeat past mistakes. (2) Regarding the purchase of rice and grain, the responsible officials of the authorities and friendly countries unanimously advocated fairness and impartiality, and not suppressing farmers with low prices. It is also hoped that the transportation authorities and military and police authorities will do their best to assist in every way, so as to provide grain merchants with the convenience they deserve. If subordinates are found to be making things difficult or extorting, they should be severely punished without leniency, in order to rectify the discipline of grain administration.</p>
<p>In short, we should know that the purpose of reorganizing the Rice Control Committee this time is to correct past malpractices and to renew all past tax policies from now on. Therefore, the mission and task are more important than all other institutions. In the event of private gain, immoral, or non-compliant behavior, it will not only be criticized by the whole country, but also ridiculed by neighboring countries. How can the crime be forgiven? Because our hopes are deep, we cannot help but be concerned. We sincerely hope that those who serve the Rice Control Committee, regardless of the size of their position, will deeply examine and restrain themselves, and not be negligent in the slightest, so as to assist the country in the success of grain administration!</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the local branch offices of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Commercial Control Association, they have been promoting their work and carrying out the task of purchasing wheat very seriously. Therefore, all facilities and businesses have gradually stabilized. In order to strengthen the control system and adjust the actual implementation of the work, the association has decided that the area under the jurisdiction of the Jiangyin Branch does not produce much wheat, and the peak season has passed. It seems that there is no need to establish it temporarily. It has issued a letter to the Wuxi Office instructing it to close within a time limit. In the future, it will be re-established when necessary. The association is continuing to investigate other local offices to determine whether they are necessary for establishment in order to adjust and strengthen the organization.</p>

<h3 id="e52">The Shanghai Fuya School for Cultivating Talented Deaf-Mutes <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>At No. 33 Huangjiasha Garden Road, east of Avenue Road and Carter Road, stands a three-story western-style building. To the south is a schoolyard enclosed by a bamboo fence. Although the transportation is very convenient, it is far from the noise of the city, truly a quiet place in the midst of the hustle and bustle! This is the famous Shanghai Fuya School, an institution for cultivating talented deaf-mutes.</p>
<p>Miserable Management</p>
<p>Outside the bamboo fence, sounds of "Ah, ah" learning to speak can be heard. Upon entering the gate, scenes of educating deaf-mute children are presented before one's eyes. Principal Wang Jingyuan, a scholar who has been enthusiastically involved in education for the blind and deaf for over thirty years and who is himself partially deaf, described the situation of deaf-mute education in China with emotion:</p>
<p>The first school in China to educate deaf-mute children was the Qiyin School, founded in Yantai, Shandong, twenty-seven years before the founding of the Republic of China. It is still in operation today. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, the Nantong School for the Blind and Deaf appeared. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the Beijing School for the Deaf and Mute appeared, and so on. However, most of them have ceased operations today. In Shanghai, as early as twenty years before the founding of the Republic of China, the Sacred Heart Convent of Xujiahui founded the Dumb School, which is still struggling to survive. Then, in the ninth year of the Republic of China, the second deaf-mute education institution appeared—the Shanghai Qunxuehui School for the Deaf and Mute. However, it has now ceased operations. The largest in scale seems to be the Shanghai Tsunlan Ya Deaf and Mute School, founded in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China by the famous American scholar Dr. Jean Lanier, which is today's Shanghai Fuya School.</p>
<p>Dr. Jean Lanier was a predecessor enthusiastic about social education in China. After he funded the founding of a school for blind children, he returned to the United States due to old age, but he still cared about charitable work in China. He believed that after the development of education for blind children, the education of deaf-mutes should not be delayed. Therefore, in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, he sent a letter to Mr. Jean Foublan, principal of the Shanghai School for Blind Children, instructing him to prepare for the establishment of a school for the deaf and mute. At that time, Mr. Fu and Wang Jingyuan, a teacher at the School for Blind Children, prepared to establish the "Jean Lanier School for the Deaf and Mute" with an opening fee of three thousand yuan at Kangjiaqiao on Jessfield Road. At that time, the Hangzhou Hui'ai School for the Deaf and Mute was unable to maintain operations, and more than ten students merged into the school. The first group of students numbered more than twenty, and the second group increased to sixty-odd. The original school building was not enough, so another western-style house was rented, and the enterprise tended to expand. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, Dr. Jean, concerned about the school and seeking permanence, sent a special letter from the United States instructing the purchase of more than twenty acres of land in Jiangwan as a permanent fund for the school for the deaf and mute. However, at that time, the Northern Expedition was taking place, and Shanghai was once in a chaotic situation, so this matter was not carried out. In the winter of that year, Dr. Jean Lanier passed away, and no will was made regarding the school for the deaf and mute, so the school had no source of funding. It had no choice but to implement austerity measures. In the spring of the eighteenth year, it was renamed Shanghai Fuya School, and a new board of directors was formed. In fact, the School for Blind Children still provided a moderate subsidy each year, about two or three thousand yuan. In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, all the students were selected into the School for Blind Children, which continued for three years.</p>
<p>In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, due to the development of school affairs, it was inconvenient to combine education with the School for Blind Children in all aspects. Therefore, Principal Jean Foublan and enthusiastic people from all walks of life, such as Wang Yiting, Chen Heqin, Shi Boqun, and the Shanghai Zhushi, initiated a fundraising campaign of 55,000 yuan. In the same year, the July 7th Incident occurred, and not only did the fundraising campaign completely stop, but also because the school site happened to be in the war zone, school affairs were temporarily suspended. It was not until the spring of the twenty-seventh year that Shanghai society gradually recovered, and parents of deaf-mute students requested to resume classes. Therefore, Wang Jingyuan, the then vice-principal, ran around planning and appointed a board of directors. First, he borrowed a part of the school building of Guohua Middle School on Rue Godefroy (hosted by Hu Shuyi) to start classes. In the spring of the twenty-eighth year, it moved to the former Central Research Institute on Route Tenant de la Tour, just opposite Zhaoyi Feng Park. The environment was quiet, and the school building was particularly grand. It was truly a place most suitable for education. At that time, the number of students also increased to more than eighty, and school affairs presented a vigorous atmosphere again. After December 8th of the thirtieth year, the school site was taken over by the municipal government. On Children's Day of the thirty-first year, it moved to the original site of the Foundling Home of the Tzu Yu Association and officially resumed classes.</p>
<p>Able to Hear and Speak</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingyuan, principal of the Fuya School, enthusiastically talked about deaf-mute education.</p>
<p>The highest goal of deaf-mute education is to enable the deaf to hear and the mute to speak, so that unfortunate deaf-mutes can study and work like healthy people. The Shanghai Fuya School also clearly states its purpose as: "To cultivate healthy bodies for deaf-mutes, to cultivate good morals for deaf-mutes, to create outstanding talents for deaf-mutes, and to develop the skills of deaf-mutes to deal with the world." In teaching, the school adopts the American-style individual education method, with no more than ten students in each class, so that both teachers and students can concentrate. Because the self-study ability of general deaf-mute students is relatively weak, there are eight classes a day, each lasting forty-five minutes, and various methods are used to inspire their interest and perseverance in learning.</p>
<p>The most basic teaching method in deaf-mute education is "phonetics," which enables deaf-mute children to pronounce sounds without relying on gestures or other symbolic notations. The most popular phonetic alphabet for educating mute children internationally is Bell's alphabet, which is based on the structure of each person's vocal organs. Various languages, such as English and French, also have their own basic phonetic alphabets. China has adopted the meaning of Bell's alphabet to create the basic alphabet of Mandarin, which is the same in number as the Mandarin phonetic symbols. The most common phonetic teaching method is for teachers and students to sit side by side facing a large mirror, so that each can see the subtle state and movement of the vocal organs when making a certain sound, in order to correct it. The best way to restore pronunciation is to start from infancy. Then, after four or five years of hard work, it is not surprising that a mute can speak.</p>
<p>It is more difficult for adult or older deaf-mute students to restore their ability to pronounce and speak, mainly because most of them lack patience and find it less convenient to use gestures. Therefore, they are taught "gesture language." There are different types of gestures, such as Mandarin gestures and English gestures, which are generally synthesized by combining phonetic, pictographic, and associative methods. In addition, for high school students, "written communication" can also be taught.</p>
<p>The problem of speech for deaf-mutes can be solved gradually through education and training in phonetics, gesture language, and written communication. As for the problem of restoring hearing for the deaf, in addition to those who are partially deaf who can use hearing aids to supplement natural hearing, there is currently no special method for so-called "heavenly hearing." What deaf-mute schools in various countries teach, in addition to relying on gestures and written communication to understand the opinions of others, is mainly what is called "speechreading," which is to enable deaf students to use their eyes instead of their ears to observe the movement of the speaker's vocal organs and their expressions to perceive the content of their language. Therefore, the teaching of speechreading also requires extraordinary hard work and extreme patience. After a long period of training, one can understand the conversation content of the other party or a second person just like a normal person.</p>
<p>The Fuya School educates deaf-mute students to the best of its ability, using the latest scientific methods in the world and adapting them to the specific circumstances of the students, in order to achieve practical results. The efforts of the past seventeen years have established a foundation for deaf-mute education in China and are among the best in the country.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Market Trends of Chinese Stocks <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the fluctuations of Chinese stocks were small, and the momentum was weak, which was due to the sale of shares by floating investors on Saturday. Large amounts of chips are still held by major investors, so it is difficult to squeeze out smaller investors. Yong'an Textile even had some buying in the afternoon, which brought the decline to the same level. Real estate stocks were the most stable. Transactions were sparse on the day. The situation of stocks in various industries is recorded below.</p>
<p>Textiles: Yong'an Textile once briefly entered the pass, but quickly returned. The final transaction was the same as the previous day's price. Dasheng No. 1 Factory was flat, and No. 3 Factory and Rongfeng Textile both rose. China Textile, Xinyi, and Meiya Silk Factory had small and slight gains. Meilun, Dagong, and Lunhua each saw a slight decline. Ruitai could not recover. Jingfu Shirt and Socks saw a new high price after the increase in capital again. Jinglun also increased by half a percent.</p>
<p>Department Stores: Xinxin Company rose slightly. Yong'an and Zhabei Department Store both declined. A certain large investor purchased a large amount of underwear, and the price was stable. Mo'an and Guanghua Department Store opened slightly higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>New Industries: Danya Concentrated Factory returned to fluctuate near Xiaosi. China-France Pharmacy was slightly weak. Deyi and Jiuxin Pharmaceutical both saw a slight decline. Wuzhou, Zhongxi, and Xinxing Pharmaceutical were all flat.</p>
<p>Finance: Zhexing and Jincheng both rose. Mainland and Yanye each rose by half a share, but it was still difficult to absorb. Shanghai, Zhongyi, and Tongyi Trust were flat.</p>
<p>Industry: Dahua Fire Company was weak and lacked momentum. Transactions of Nanyang and Huacheng Tobacco were also sparse. Jiuan Industrial's old shares and ex-rights shares each rose slightly. Dahua Industrial opened with a premium of 10% over par value. Xinya Construction was stable. Datong Industry rose slightly. Xinghua Industry was flat. Within the par value, there was little supply. China and Guohua Investment were both boosted by major investors. Kangyuan Canning reached a new high price again before returning to flat. Sanyou Industry declined slightly. Fumin Dairy and Standard Monosodium Glutamate were priced the same as the previous day. Bao'an Glass and Huasheng Ceramics were flat. China Film declined slightly.</p>
<p>Culture: Only Shijie Struggle Journey saw an opening, and the price was slightly lower. The price reduction of Commercial Press and China Police Bureau was flat. Yongxiang Printing and Standard Paper Products also had little change.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Summary of Commercial News <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday's market price continued to rise strongly, especially for the so-called miscellaneous brands such as A, B, D, and E, which rose even more strongly. Market sentiment gradually became excited. There were many who sold Category C and bought miscellaneous brands because the price difference between miscellaneous brands and Category C for the same goods was too large, which caused some exchange, resulting in a smaller increase in Category C. Category C opened flat, then rose sharply. It once saw a small decline in the middle, then rose slowly with the price of miscellaneous brands. The final price at noon was better than the previous day. The rise of Categories A, B, D, and E was stronger than that of Category C.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate: The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association eased. The listed price was reduced by another two points, to 14%.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabrics: The market continued to be strong yesterday, and the market price trend was firm. Qipao woolen fabrics were the most popular. General western-style tailor shops and woolen fabric and silk shops that sold them had excellent business. Because 70-80% of these qipao woolen fabrics are made of Chinese wool, and there is more cotton than wool and more wool than light fabrics. Sixty-inch wide doors are all priced at over 13%, and the price is also cheap, which is very popular among women. Retail sales are good, and wholesale transactions are also lively.</p>

<p>After the war, agricultural production declined, and unscrupulous merchants hoarded and manipulated prices, causing agricultural product prices to rise, which had a huge impact on the entire social life. At this time of war, it is urgent to actively promote increased food production in the rear. Therefore, the Food Department requires the rice and wheat experimental farms in the province to fill out investigation forms in detail regarding the superior rice and wheat seeds collected this year, so that farmers can adopt them to increase agricultural production and stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Life of a Secretary <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Xiepu Ke</p>
<p>At present, there is no way out for friends of the pen. No matter how knowledgeable you are and how capable you are of writing powerfully, others will always see you as "a useless scholar." Wearing a long gown is a waste of life! To be honest, it is far inferior to a rickshaw puller or a boy in a restaurant, who can be wealthier. Unless you become the chief secretary of a prominent official, with a high position and generous salary, can you be haughty! In my spare time, I also serve as a Chinese secretary for someone. Speaking of the life of a secretary? You must have the talent to write quickly and accurately. Otherwise, before one document is finished, another one comes, putting pressure on your desk, making you feel like "nothing is as it should be"! Moreover, you must understand your master's intentions and be able to guess the words and phrases he wants to say and the meaning he wants to express, catering to his psychology. You must also be good at writing to win the master's praise and reuse. Over time, you can be trusted to open letters, act on his behalf, and actually handle matters. Otherwise, no matter how wonderful your writing is, you will be ordered to rewrite it again and again. The mental burden is unbearable. Sometimes, when the master gets angry, the secretary has to endure it for the sake of making a living. In the eyes of others, the private secretary of a wealthy man or general manager must be in a good position and receive special favors. In fact, who knows the inner suffering of being a secretary? As for the treatment, providing you with a meal and giving you a monthly salary of 300 or 400 yuan is already a great favor. Regardless of your family burden, or what you are raising, taking the meager monthly salary, no matter how clever your economic calculations are, in this situation of rising living standards, it really feels like a non-sense!</p>

<h3 id="e58">Sunday Commentary Edition (Continued from page 1) <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has entered a stage of confrontation. If this stage continues for a considerable period of time, what will break this equilibrium? I firmly believe that if Japan can use the liberation demands of all Asian nations as the driving force for carrying out the Greater East Asia War, then Japan can quickly decide the war. The independence movement of Asian nations originates from the inevitability of world history and has irresistible power. The Japanese who recognize the Meiji Restoration as a Japanese national independence movement originating from the inevitability of world history must also recognize that the nations of Asia, which are slightly less culturally advanced than Japan, are imitating the Japanese precedent and launching national liberation movements. This is an unavoidable event. Just as after the French Revolution, no one could stop the nationalist movement throughout Europe, naturally, no one can hinder or strangle the Asian national movement. History has already proven this in Japan and China, and is now proving it in India, the Philippines, Burma, and other countries. If Japan can grasp this historical inevitability and use it as a driving force for the Greater East Asia War, then all Asian nations will become Japan's comrades-in-arms. No matter how much Britain and the United States flaunt their huge productivity, they cannot cope with the solidarity of half of the world's population. When the strength of all the liberated Asian nations becomes the pillar of Japan, that will be the time to determine the outcome of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>As I have repeatedly stated in my paper, the so-called entire Asian nations, the important ones are only Japan, China, and India. However, the attitude of the Indian nation towards Japan depends on Japan's attitude towards the Chinese nation. The reason why Indian leaders such as Gandhi and Nehru have not yet publicly stated their support for Japan is that the Sino-Japanese Incident has not yet been resolved. On the whole, the attitude of the Chinese towards Japan is not yet clear. If the Sino-Japanese Incident is resolved satisfactorily, and if the Chinese nation fully supports Japan, then the Indian nation will also fully support Japan without hesitation. From this point of view, the future of the Greater East Asia War ultimately depends on how Sino-Japanese relations are adjusted.</p>
<p>Therefore, the issue of comprehensive Sino-Japanese peace has once again produced new historical significance. This comprehensive peace cannot be achieved by external pressure. Peace achieved by external pressure only suppresses the superficial resistance to the inside. This kind of peace, which appears to be in harmony but is not, accumulates and increases the force of resistance internally. If external pressure weakens, it will immediately erupt from the inside into a huge fire of resistance. The Sino-Japanese peace that determines the power of the Greater East Asia War cannot be such a comprehensive peace. However, for the point of achieving peace through frank and open talks between the two sides without relying on external pressure, Japan, which has greater external pressure than Chongqing, naturally holds more initiative. Comprehensive Chinese peace determines the trend of Asian nations, the trend of Asian nations determines the Greater East Asia War, and the result of the Greater East Asia War determines the future of the world war. If this is really the case, then the decision-making power of the world war is still in the hands of China and Japan. To put it more concretely, it depends on how Japan takes the initiative in comprehensive peace and how China responds to it. This is by no means an exaggeration.</p>
<p>If Chinese pessimists seek pessimistic arguments in the possibility of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, that is another matter and not within the scope of this article. As for the attitude of discovering pessimistic arguments in the European situation, it must be pointed out once again that this is because I unknowingly accepted the influence of the traditional "War of Resistance concept" in Chinese intellectual circles.

<p>— Zhu Wenjie</p>
<p>Price controls, rationing, and standardization of Western medicine is difficult because it is a complex category and cannot be uniformly managed. Because the items are small in size and high in value, they are easy to hoard, especially since all raw materials are imported from abroad. Since the outbreak of war, the supply has been cut off. While raw materials and medicines still exist, the merchants are in control of them. Those merchants with a large supply of items are frequently able to control prices and artificially raise them. Also, holders of goods only need to store goods for one more day to make profit. So, they hoard goods and do not sell. Purchasers do not hesitate to purchase at high prices, so prices climb. I will recount my views and what I have witnessed as a contribution and reference for the authorities.</p>
<p>Price Limits and the Black Market</p>
<p>Since the last strict order of the authorities to limit the prices of some medicines, the situation was only partially managed and the items were just hidden and diverted to the black market. Those who held goods acted this way because the limited prices were below the cost of production or because black market prices were higher and would make more profit. Those who legally needed the goods were unable to buy them. So, many people were unable to purchase goods and a strange phenomenon of "high prices, no goods" occurred. The formation of a black market is related to many factors:</p>
<p>Some Improper Western Pharmacies—The operation of these pharmacies seems like a black market for medicines. These businesses do not act like a retail business and do not do any wholesale trading. They specialize in buying and selling black market items and giving rebates to people. The pharmacies sell off goods they are unable to raise the prices for, or the pharmacies and doctors resell their allotment of goods they received from foreign trading companies or from Chinese medicine factories, to merchants in other cities or sell the goods on the black market to needy patients. During the height of Western medicine inflation, the proliferation of these types of pharmacies were like bamboo shoots growing after the rain, because the equipment required was simple—a telephone, a room, a knowledgeable middleman, and an advertisement for the desired goods in the trade listings or for goods being sold. Trading one day, one makes hundreds of thousands of dollars and does not take this as a big deal. This type of light investment, heavy profit-making business must be strictly investigated during crackdown on black marketeers.</p>
<p>Pharmacies—When going to pharmacies to purchase goods with limited prices, you will usually not be able to buy anything. It is impossible for the medicine to be immediately sold out when the price limit is enacted, because medicines are not daily supplies, such as soaps, coal or rice, and are only needed when one is sick. So, the items are regularly funneled to the black market or hoarded. If the authorities organize an investigative team, they must strictly examine the detailed purchase and sales records of the pharmacies. If an investigation finds wrongdoing, they must be strictly punished to serve as an example to others. Additionally, the authorities must encourage citizens to report any wrongdoing and if the claim is substantiated, reward the reporter.</p>
<p>Doctors—Some doctors also seek small profits. The allotments they receive each month from the trading companies or pharmaceutical factories are also sold on the black market for profit. The original intention of the allotment by the trading company is lost. Why would the trading company not sell on the black market itself? Those who give allotments should be trading companies who want to extend benefits directly to patients by way of a doctor. Some may introduce patients to a place where they can purchase medicine (a place they specify), but are secretly consigning their medicine to that place and are paying a commission to the consignee. For the sake of morality, reputation, and credibility, doctors should not profit in this way.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical Factories—The prices of pharmaceutical factory products must be approved by the authorities before the goods can be sold. When the black market prices of raw materials are above the cost of the products, the pharmaceutical factories will frequently stop manufacturing or distributing products, and products circulating in the market will flow into the black market. Pharmaceutical factories are the source of medicines—we must distribute raw materials to them and thoroughly investigate the remaining raw materials and products of the factory so that it can continue to manufacture and distribute.</p>
<p>Standardization</p>
<p>Standardization of all medicines includes registration, purchasing and distributing. We know that the amount of goods consumed by the right consumer is unrelated to the price of goods. The purchase and distribution are described below.</p>
<p>Buy Raw Materials—All materials, such as Vaseline, baking soda, must be re-registered, no matter if they have been previously registered and sealed. Those who resist must have their goods confiscated and punished with multiple times the fine amount. The authorities must set up a purchasing organization and pool resources from major pharmacies. Goods must be purchased from everyone (those with names), because in the previous registration, many parties had commissioned pharmacies to register using false names. Many of the goods hoarded and not sold by large pharmacies must be bought. The raw materials of Western medicine dealers must also be purchased.</p>
<p>Check Finished Medicines—Finished medicines must also be registered in order to avoid having too many or too few items at the time of cutting off supplies. The volume of business of each pharmacy must be used to determine the amount of goods to be held and calculated against the average amount held by all pharmacies. The excess can then be deducted from later rations or directly purchased. Deficiencies can be supplemented.</p>
<p>Distribution—Distribute raw materials to factories after thoroughly checking the factory's products and the amount of raw materials consumed each month. The two are then compared. Especially needed medicines must be distributed with raw materials and a mandate to manufacture, and it must be strictly prohibited to hide or resell allotted raw materials or products. Then the products from each pharmaceutical factory are thoroughly calculated and rationed in a fair way with reference to the actual monthly sales. The retail price of each pharmacy is strictly limited with an appropriate profit margin.</p>
<p>The above are all ways to make laws within an absence of laws. It is best that medicine sources are clear, and if not, the next best thing is to plan details and put rationing into effect with speed and strictness. The results will be fruitful. Without thorough implementation, more problems than benefits will result. For example, limiting prices may lead to a phenomenon of high prices and no goods. Lastly, I would like to make a special appeal to doctors to make the most of circulating medicines and use substitutes for short-term goods.</p>
<h3 id="e60">National Medicine Industry's Thrift Movement <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Bomin</p>
<p>In this extraordinary period, the conservation of materials should be advocated, and this is something that everyone agrees with. Therefore, enlightened people are promoting thrift movements. As a doctor, I associate this with the national medicine aspect, where there is a great need for promoting thrift. My humble opinions are as follows:</p>
<p>National medicine merchants desire medicinal materials of excellent color and quality, hoping to sell them at a good price. Therefore, they often use sulfur to fumigate and bake the medicinal products. In this way, yellow can become white, and black can become white, thus doubling the selling price. As for merchants who only pursue profit, they naturally do not care about this. However, the nature of medicinal materials is changed due to sulfur fumigation, which is morally unacceptable. Moreover, sulfur is also a military supply, and its price is extremely high. The cost ultimately falls on the consumer. I believe that medicinal materials should only be required to originate from authentic regions, focusing on suitable quality. Why take this unnecessary step?</p>
<p>National medicine shops often seek the beauty of decoction pieces, often applying a layer of wax to the surface of the medicinal product, such as Cyperi rhizoma slices, and Sennae Folium, etc. This is an unnecessary procedure, which does not help anything, only increasing the burden on the patient.</p>
<p>Furthermore, another point that should be reformed is that the medicinal slices are cut extremely thin, like membranes. This wastes too much effort, and the selling price is often calculated accordingly. Examples include Pinellia Rhizoma Praeparatum, raw White Peony Root, Arisaema cum Bile, Aconitum carmichaeli Debx, and Aconitum kusnezoffii Reichb., etc. National medicine shops have a saying: "Aconite slices fly to the sky, betel nuts must be cut into one hundred and twenty-eight slices." In this atmosphere of advocating thrift, the decoction pieces should focus on authentic compatibility, why seek formal prettiness? There is a great need to change the current slicing method to a thicker, more original slice. Recently, there have been frequent reports that the public is suffering from the burden of medical expenses. As a member of the medical profession, medicine and pharmacy are inherently linked. In order to support the extraordinary period's thrift movement and consider the burden on patients, I humbly offer my views to my colleagues in the industry. I simply feel like speaking out to relieve what's on my mind, whether you agree or disagree, let it be.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Antang Hospital Relieves Impoverished Patients. Hope all Circles Hasten to Aid with Funds. <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Antang Hospital, affiliated with the Renai General Hospital at 149 Luban Road, Wangzhi Road intersection, was founded by French Catholic nuns and has been in operation for 56 years. It specializes in treating impoverished patients. For minor illnesses, it provides diagnosis and medication; for severe cases, it provides hospitalization and treatment, with all expenses completely waived. In recent years, it has been treating more than 200 inpatients and 700-800 outpatients every month. All regular expenses were previously covered by donations from abroad, with no fixed funding. Since the outbreak of the war, transportation has been blocked, and the source of funding has been interrupted. The hospital's patients have been reduced from three meals a day to three servings of thin porridge a day. Rice is like pearls, firewood like cassia, and income is nowhere to be found. Relying on past savings, it has barely managed to survive to this day, but is now running out of medicine and food. The hospitalized elderly, weak, poor, and sick are facing imminent death.</p>
<p>Following the principle of mutual assistance and extending care to others, I dare to make an urgent appeal to all sectors, sincerely hoping that all philanthropists will generously donate to help the general impoverished and sick to avoid starvation and death. This kindness will be akin to rebirth, and the merit will be immeasurable. Please send donations to the Renai General Association at 149 Luban Road, Wangzhi Road, or call 81570 to notify the hospital, and they will immediately send a nun to receive it. If there are old clothes, torn quilts, etc., that are discarded and not used, the hospital also welcomes donations.</p>
<p>The hospital has always adhered to a pragmatic approach, working diligently and earnestly, focusing solely on practical results, and not using the beautiful name of charity as a banner. Quietly in a corner, it serves the impoverished and sick, and therefore is very isolated from the outside world. Now, to allow the outside world to recognize the hospital and gain a clearer understanding, we welcome all sectors to visit and inspect. The hospital's board will naturally provide sincere hospitality. (Xia Yufen)</p>
<p>Also, the hospital is organizing a Sino-Western soccer charity match to raise funds for medicine, inviting the East China and West Union teams to compete. It was originally scheduled to be held at the Aurora University stadium at 5:00 PM this (24th) afternoon. However, due to the fact that all preparations have not yet been completed, it has been decided to postpone the event. Once a definite date has been determined, it will be announced again.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Wooden Spinning Machine on Public Display <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Improved Wooden Spinning Machine Training Institute has temporarily closed due to the expiration of the rental period of its location, but the improvement work is still in progress. Jiang Jun, a graduate of the first term, has also designed, patterned, and supervised the construction of a spinning machine, and the trial spinning results have been quite promising. Mr. Jiang adheres to the purpose of the institute, aiming to promote cotton spinning to benefit rural areas, and is not secretive. He welcomes visits and guidance. The spinning machine is currently displayed at the Dafugui Gift Shop, 129 Tianjin Road.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Joint Youth League Charity Sale for Education Concludes Accounts <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The charity sale for education by the League initially encountered several setbacks, and the license was not approved until the end of last month. On the first day of the charity sale, the Jiande Child School sent more than ten children to assist, and later received a lot of help from Mr. Shang Xiaofeng, Zhang Chaoyu, Yu Ruiqing, Zhu Bingmin, Wang Tongxin, and Wang Yaoying. We hereby express our gratitude. This charity sale concluded on the 20th of this month. The income and expenditure accounts are listed below: The total proceeds from the flower sale amounted to 8,611.05 yuan. Necessary expenses, excluding 1,457 yuan, and the retail donation to the First District Public Office of 172.2 yuan (temporarily stored in the Youth Association), leaves a net surplus of 6,981.3 yuan. 3,490.65 yuan will be allocated to the Shenbao Scholarship, the same amount will go to the Xinwenbao Scholarship. (Joint Youth League)</p>
